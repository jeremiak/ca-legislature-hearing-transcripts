WITH THE LAND SHERMAN ACT IN ITS CURRENT FORM. OR DOES THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION WANT TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE PATH. IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN TO CONSIDER WAYS TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM BASED ON ITS PER RIGHT PRIORITIES AND WITHIN AVAILABLE RESOURCES. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING TO IMPLEMENT THE RATE STUDY IT APPEARS TO BE CONSIDERING SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE PATH. YOU CONSIDERING ALL OF THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE KEEP THIS KEY DECISION POINT IN MIND. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS- I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THAT ENOUGH- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT OUR OFFICE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO HELP IN ANY WAY IS THE LEGISLATURE GRAPPLES WITH THESE DECISIONS. WE BELIEVE THE IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY FOR TODAY HOWEVER IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT. WHATEVER DIRECTION THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION CHOOSE TO TAKE IT SHOULD BE DONE WITH EYES WIDE OPEN. IF THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT INTEND ON. IN OF THE RATE STUDY AND INTENDS TO PROPOSE A REDESIGN TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM IT SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THESE PLANS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS CAN PROPERLY WAITING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE WE WILL BRING IT TO THE SUB COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS AND WOULD LIKE TO OFFER IT TO MY COLLEAGUES FIRST. NOT THEN I WILL START. I KNOW THERE IS A WORK GROUP THAT HAS. FORM A- TASK FORCE IF YOU WILL WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE DISCUSSION CURRENTLY WITH THE INADEQUACY OF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- NANCY BARGE MEN- DIRECTOR- I WE HAVE JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE- WAS DEVELOPED- EARLY AND I'M TWO THOUSAND TWELVE- WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT WAS THE FUTURE FOR TO- THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND MOVED TO. THE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TASK FORCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW REBUILDING THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM SO RECENTLY WE DID A RECONSTITUTING OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE IS WHILE WE DID ADD SOME MEMBERS OF THE CLASS- TASK FORCE A MEMBERSHIP. IT REALLY WASN'T REPRESENTATIVE OF KIND OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND LOOKING AT NOT ONLY THE REPRESENTATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING- BUT ALSO THAN TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD SO ARE ABLE TO RECONSTITUTE THAT. PLEASE TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REPRESENTATIVE GROUP THAT IS ON THE DS TASK FORCE AND THEN THE- FIVE RELATED WORK GROUPS- WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK I THINK TO GET FULL REPRESENTATION OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT. THAT WILL BE PART OF WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT LATER IN ANOTHER ISSUE- BUT TO YOUR QUESTION AS FAR AS KIND OF WHAT IS THAT FOCUS. SO WE DO HAVE- A BIG TASK AT HAND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AS FAR AS THE SYSTEM AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. CERTAINLY THE PROVIDER RATES TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE WORK THROUGH THE- SERVICE COORDINATORS BECAUSE WE HEAR THAT- THE OPERATIONS OF THE REGIONAL CENTER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SIR. AND THE BEST A- CELL NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'VE GOT AN INITIAL MEETING WITH THE SYSTEM SCORE WORK. THAT WILL FEED INFORMAION TO THE D. S. TASK FORCE IT WAS A FOUNDATIONAL CONVERSATION TO SAY WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WERE SEEN THAT'S WORKING IN THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE RECOGNIZING THAT ARE. WORKING THERE THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE FOCUS ON. IS A SURPRISE THAT SOME THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP OR THAT THEY WERE DISCUSSING TODAY. I'M HOWEVER THERE'S ALL THE AND THE VOTE THE CONVERSATION THE DOESN'T. HAPPEN BUT ONCE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SERVICE CORPS ASIA AND HOW DO WE DELIVER CARE COORDINATOR FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE IS THE WORK THAT THE RULES DON'T DOES WITH WITH HOW TO DELIVER THAT. THE. COORDINATION SERVICE. I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN I STARTED. SO CORD I. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE TELLING WHEN I TELL YOU HOW MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS A LITTLE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW KIND OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR SYSTEM OVER TIME. WE ARE A VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM. THAN WE WERE. YOU KNOW WHEN EVEN I STARTED. SO WE THOSE ARE THE DIFFICULT OR- COMPLEX CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO GET TO THE POINT OF TRANSPARENCY. AS AN ADMINISTRATION THERE'S SOME REALLY COR TENANTS IN CORE- PHILOSOPHICAL THINGS THAT. ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR SYSTEM. THERE'S TRANSPARENCY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PERSON CENTERED. THAT WERE REALLY VALUING WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING. AND WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE GOING FORWARD. WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINED SYSTEM OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS RATE STRUCTURES ARE RATE MODELS SIR I MEAN IN THE SENSE OF THAT. THE METHODOLOGY OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WE HAVE A GREAT INFORMATION FROM THE RATE STUDY. THAT'S GOING TO HELP AND FORMER CONVERSATION. SO MOVING TO THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AS FAR AS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING THE WORK OF OUR WORK. GROUPS IS REALLY ON THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW JUST TO TAKE A- LOOK AT. NOT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. HELLO YEAH BUT ASKED BE. FOR SIX. OF VERY TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE PAYING. WHAT'S THE VALUE TO IN OF THE WHO'S- SIR. SO YOU STAY. SAYS TAKE OFF AT WHAT IT VALUE BAY. SINCE THAT ARE WERE. OR HOW CAN BE HOW. STATE. THE STATE'S LET'S START IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE JUST APPLIED FOR THE NEXT ROUND I'M AND WE WERE JUST SELECTED- SO WE JUST RECEIVED NOTICE THAT CMS IS GOING TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THEN THE ID D. SPACE AND HOW DO WE LOOK AT TAKING A LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM KIND OF STRUCTURES TO BEST SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ALL HAVE- A CONCERN FOR SO THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM WORK GROUP IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS LOOKING BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DEFINE THE GOALS AND THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THEM GETTING HAS A COMMON THEME YOU'RE HEARING TODAY AS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO EASURE OUTCOMES. WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING AS FAR AS THE EXPERIENCE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS. I'M THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO WE'RE GONNA FOCUS THERE THE NEXT PART OF IT THOUGH IS THAT AS PART OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT. WHERE THOSE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING TIME THAT IS GOING TO BE LONG WE UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS AND WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE TIME SENSITIVITY TO IT. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE OF. IF I MAY AT SOME POINT WITH THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WE TALK. DOLLARS AND SENSE AS WELL AND SO. THE RATE CITY WAS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT NEEDING ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR- IMPLEMENTING THE RATE STUDY LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THROUGH THE EIGHT POINT 2% FOR CERTAIN RATES- MY- CONCERN IS- WE ARE FAST APPROACHING OUR NEXT BUDGET. AND NEED TO. HAVE SOME TYPE OF SIGN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF THESE DISCUSSIONS RECENTLY CAN EXPECT TO. HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR THE MAY REVISION. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE DO THESE DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN BEFORE THEN. OR DO WE HAVE ANOTHER YEAR OF RATES THAT AREN'T. ADEQUATELY HELPING US WHERE I THINK THEY SHOULD AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND NEEDING. TO MAKE SURE THERE'S QUALITY AND DATA AND TRANSPARENCY WITH IT AND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT BUT I JUST AM TRYING TO GET A SENSE TO YOU. DO YOU THINK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN BY MAY REVISIONS. WERE HAVING- AN- INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS- AS FAR AS ANYTHING THAT IS PART OF- PROPOSALS GOING FORWARD IS A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS- INTERNAL AND AT THIS POINT I CAN'T- PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAIL. ON. OUR OUR HOPE AS A SUB COMMITTEE IS TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND SO I. MY REQUEST WOULD BE TO HOPEFULLY PROVIDE US AN UPDATE. ON THESE PROPOSALS AND DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT FISCAL REFORMS SPECIFICALLY- AND ANYTHING WE'RE GONNA DO WITH RATES ARE FUNDING COMPLIANCE OR CASELOAD RATIOS- WE HAVE A FOLLOW UP HEARING ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND TERM WOULD HOPE WE COULD- HERE ABOUT IT BEFORE THAT. FURTHERMORE WE ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE VETTING ANYTHING THAT'S COMING AND MAY REVISION AND MAKE SURE THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE ADEQUATELY A PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT OCCUR BETWEEN NOW AND THEN- THESE ARE VERY CRITICAL FORUMS AND REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT'S WE SHOULD. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEARD FULLY. INTEND THAT- MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR US TO ADOPT THEM IF WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN A TIMELY FASHION SO- WE JUST APPRECIATE AND MAKE THAT REQUEST. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. THE MASS THE SERGEANTS TO- CONTACT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. SINCE HE WILL BE PRESENTING BUT PRIOR TO PRESENTING ON ISSUE TOO I MAY ASK TO ESTABLISH CORPS. DOCTOR ARAMBULA PRESENT. FRAZIER MATHIS. PATTERSON RAMOS RUBIO HERE DOCTOR WOULD. WE HAVE THREE. MR PATTERSON'S HERE HAVE FOR. WE OKAY SERVICE. AND OKAY- SORRY ABOUT THAT MISS CHAIRMAN- I KNOW MR HOLD MAYBE COMING SO IF IT COMES I WILL STOP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS WONDERFUL COMMITTEE AND STAFF- ALSO A QUICK THANK YOU TO THE SERGEANTS AUDIO WAS IN ON FOR THIS HEARING AT THE BEGINNING BUT THEY QUICKLY GOT IT ON THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WATCH AROUND THE STATE AS WELL SO THANK YOU TO THEM- MY NAME IS JORDAN LINDSAY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC IN UNITED CIVIL POSEY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION I'M ALSO CHAIR OF THE LIMóN COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS- MANY STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT BOTH INTELLECT. IT'S A BIT THESE HEARD THROUGH THE LANHAM ACT CALIFORNIA PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOP A DISABILITIES IN THIS YEAR ALONE MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND NEW INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPECTED TO REQUIRE SUPPORT. SAME TIME DIRECT SUPPORT STAFF TURNOVER. HI DUE TO LOW WAGES ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS ARE CLOSING ACROSS THE STATE. AND REGIONAL CENTER CASELOAD RATIOS ARE TOO HIGH. AND EXCEED FEDERAL ASSURANCES. ALL OF WHICH FORCE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH INADEQUATE OR NO SUPPORTS. THINGS SUCH I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE HAVE HEARD IN YOUR DISTRICTS FROM FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA RECENTLY AS YOU NOTED COMPLETED A MULTI YEAR RATE STUDY WHICH CONFIRMED THIS WITH AN UNDER FUNDING DETERMINED TO BE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPS ITS ABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR DIRECT SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONALS ARE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THIS UNDER FUNDING- JUST A FEW HOURS AGO I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH. IN A MOTHER OF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WITH AUTISM AND SH AS OF TWO DAYS AGO SHE'S NOT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS INTEREST ON ORANGE COUNTY. AND THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DESPERATELY WHAT TO DO THE BIGGEST CONCERN OF COURSE BEING FOR HER SON. AND WE ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO TRY TO WRAP SOME SERVICES AROUND FOR THEM. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE BUDGETED BUDGETED INCREASE. AS YOU MENTION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THIS COMMITTEE WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT THANK YOU. AN STILL HOWEVER DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ARE GLARINGLY UNDEFINED UNDER FUNDED BY MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. NOW THE APPROPRIATE AND REQUIRED COURSE OF ACTION IS TO IMPLEMENT A MULTI YEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PLAN WHICH ENSURES THAT THE COMMUNITY AND THE PROMISE OF THE LANHAM ACT MOVES FROM A TIME OF CRISIS AND INTO A TIME OF OPPORTUNITY. ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER HAS PUT TOGETHER THAT PLAN HE'S NOT ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY- SO I WILL QUICKLY. DESCRIBE THAT PLAN IT IS LAID OUT VERY WELL IN THE THOROUGH. AGENDA THE PLAN HAS FIVE ELEMENTS TO IT NUMBER ONE FIRST PHASE IN THE DDS RATE MODELS OVER THREE YEARS WITH AN INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND EACH YEAR. THIS WILL GET US T BE AMOUNT NEEDED THE DETERMINED UNDER FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE UPDATED RATE MODELS. THE LAMBING COALITION HAS BEEN WORKING FEVERISHLY TO CREATE A DETAILED AND STRATEGIC THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. AND WE ARE ONLY A COUPLE DAYS AWAY FROM FINALISING IT. WE ARE EAGER TO SHARE IT WITH THE COMMITTEE LA FINANCING THE DEPARTMENT. THE PLAN INCLUDES NOT ONLY FUNDING METHODOLOGIES. BUT ALSO THE DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS INCENTIVES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. SECOND PART O THE PLAN TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR THE SERVICES THAT WERE MISTAKENLY OMITTED FROM LAST YEAR'S PROVIDER SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES THIS WAS INCLUDED AS NOTING THE AGENDA IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HOWEVER IT NOT UNTIL JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE START DATE. WOULD YOU PROPOSE THAT FAIR IS FAIR AND JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY RETROACTIVE START DATE IS THE APPROPRIATE PATH FORWARD FOR THOSE THREE SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT LIVING INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND EARLY START SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. THE THIRD PART OF THE PLAN. IT'S COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGIONAL CENTER CASELOAD RATIOS BY HIRING EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS SOME YOU'LL HEAR MORE OF FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN LATER IN THE AGENDA AND SO I WILL LET HIM GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL ABOUT THAT PART OF THE PLAN- THE FOURTH PART IS SOLVE THE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR QUITE AWHILE. ENSURE THAT ALL DDS FUNDED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS RECEIVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES BY THREE POINT 3% INCREASE THE RATE MODELS ARE ONLY UPDATED TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY JENNY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE ALREADY EVEN IF WE DO NOTHING THREE POINT 3% BEHIND IF WE ENACT IN FULL RATE MODELS THIS YEAR WE'RE STILL THREE POINT 3% BEHIND BECAUSE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE. INCREASE ON JERRY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT IT WILL ALSO BE EXPLAINED FURTHER. BY ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN. AND THE FIFTH PART OF THE PLAN IS TO SECURE A FOUNDATION FOR LONG TERM PLANNING BY PERMANENTLY REMOVING THE SUSPENSION DATE THAT IS- CURRENTLY ENACTED IN PROPOSING A JET IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS BEEP FURTHER MOVE BACK FURTHER BUT STILL IT ALL WE HEAR THAT THIS MAKES LONG TERM PLANNING IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THIS PLAN IN PLACE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL RESTORE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND WE WILL ENTER A NEW ERA NOW THAT WE ARE FINISHING AN ERROR OF THE PAST FIFTY YEARS A NEW ERA OF COMMUNITY INCLUSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IS MESSED PARTICULARLY ON THIS DAYS LONG. BEEN A CHAMPION AND- REALLY HELD THE TORCH AND JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THEM AND- APPRECIATE. HIS ABSENCE OF WITHOUT ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY TO ACKNOWLEDGE- STE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRASIER'S. CONSISTENT CONTRIBUTION TO MOVING TE BALL DOWN THE FIELD ON THE SUBJECT- AS NOTED THE LA OWES ANALYSIS OF THE DDS TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET THE CURRENT DDS RATE STRUCTURE IS NOT ALIGNED WITH CURRENT SERVICES. AND SERVICE NEEDS WHO TREATS SIMILAR SERVICE PROVIDERS IT DIFFERENTLY AND ACCORDING TO THE RATE STUDY HAS SIZABLE FUNDING GAPS. OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. MOREOVER MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES EXACERBATE FUNDING CHALLENGES IN SEVERAL WAYS THE STATE HAS NOT ADJUSTED PROVIDER RATES TO ACCOUNT FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES WHICH YOU'VE HEARD THE RATE ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED TO COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES HAS NOT. BEEN AVAILABLE TO PROVIDERS IN AREAS WITH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT EXCEED THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE THEREFORE MANY AREAS OF THE STATE WHICH PROVIDERS WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES FROM TWELVE DOLLARS TO THIRTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR WE'RE REQUESTING TWENTY NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR ADJUSTING THE RATES OF COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH INCREASES IN THE- STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THE CURRENT PROCESS OF MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS PROVEN INADEQUATE AND HAS RESULTED IN THE UNINTENDED WITHHOLDING A VITAL NEEDS THIS IS FROM STRUGGLING SERVICE PROVIDERS IN MANY AREAS OF OUR STATE WHERE SERVICES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED THE LA- HAS TAKEN NOTE OF THIS PROBLEM DUBBING AT THE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK DUE IN LARGE MEASURE TO A QUIRK AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RATE ADJUSTMENTS. PROGRAMS IN HIGH COST AREAS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN INCREASE ONE STATE MINIMUM WAGE RISES BUT PROGRAMS AND LOWER COSTS AREAS ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AN INCREASE WITHOUT AN ADULT ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR RATES TO COVER WAGE INCREASES PROVIDERS IN THESE AREAS OF HAD TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN ALL AREAS OF THEIR OPERATIONS. DEFICIT SPEND AND RELY MORE HEAVILY ON SOFT WIRED IN IN SECURE FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS FUND RAISING AND SPENDING DOWN ENDOWMENTS. THE IMPACT OF SERVICES OF INCREASING WAGE COSTS WITH NO CORRESPONDING RATE ADJUSTMENTS HAS BEEN CRUSHING SIR PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE GREATER BAY AREA LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY REPORT GROWING STAFF VACANCIES IN TURN OVER RATES. APPROACHING 50% A GROWING NUMBER OF AGENCIES ACROSS THESE REGIONS AND REPORT ARE REPORTING THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO CANCEL SERVICES ON A ROUTINE BASIS. DUE TO A LACK OF AVAILABLE DIRECT SUPPORT STAFF. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO FIND A UNIFORM THREE POINT 33% RATE ADJUSTMENT FOR EACH ONE DOLLAR OF STATE MINIMUM WAGE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ISSUE WE REQUESTED APPROPRIATION OF TWENTY NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND. WHICH WILL BE JANET WHICH WILL GENERATE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TO REACH THE TOTAL COSTS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR OF FIFTY SIX MILLION. I HAVE WITH ME. THOSE WHO SPOKEN OF WHO ARE JOINING IN TO- MAKE THE POINT OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE DEVELOP THIS CALCULATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN IF- YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR GUESTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT- I DID WANT TO RECOGNIZE IT SHOULD BE DIRECTOR PARCHMAN- WHO HAS A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS WELL AND SO. WE WILL MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE YOU. HI THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME'S TOM HEINZ I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT CALLED THE SPAN OF A SINCE. WE SERVE FOLKS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY TO HELP THEM LIVE ON THEIR OWN. AND FIND EMPLOYMENT. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY RIGHT NOW THERE'S A TWO POINT 5% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AVERAGE RENTS IN OAKLAND FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT AND 90% OF THE WEIGHT OF A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL IN MY AGENCY. I AND ARE SUPPORTED LIVING PROGRAM WE SERVE PEOPLE WHO NEED TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPPORT WHO HAVE- SIGNIFICANT- PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISABILITIES. OFTENTIMES ARE NON VERBAL AND IN MANY OF THESE SITUATIONS TO OUR STAFF THAT SERVE THESE FOLKS WHO ARE ARE VULNERABLE IN MAKING JUST THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THESE ARE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE STATE DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY REIMBURSES FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE. I NEEDLESS TO SAY WERE LOSING THE BATTLE IN COMPETING FOR WORKERS LAST YEAR WE LOST NINETY THREE WORKERS OUT OF A HUNDRED NINETY POSITIONS SO REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US. THANKS HIGH HARY BRAWL WITH PAT% POINT- THE STATE CURRENTLY USES TWO WAYS TO DETERMINE HOW TO ADJUST RATES WHEN MINUTES STATE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP FOR OUR COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES THERE'S FOUR AND 5% FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S A LABORIOUS PROCESS pINDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS WHO EARN LESS THAN THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE COMPILING ALL THAT DATA CHURNING IT OUT AND COMING UP WITH NEW INDIVIDUAL RATES FOR EACH. PROGRAM SO BESIDES THIS ADMINISTRATIVE HEAVY PROCESS IT HAS A SEPARATE ISSUE WHICH IS THAT IN AREAS WHERE WE CAN'T PAY MINIMUM WAGE. IT'S NOT THERE'S NO REIMBURSEMENT SO I'M FROM SANTA BARBARA WE DON'T HAVE A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE BUT OUR COST OF LIVING ARE SO HIGH THAT WE CAN'T PAY WE PAY A DOLLAR A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR RATES. THERE'S NO SUPPORT SO WE HAVE AS A BACKWARD SYSTEM WHERE LOW COST THERE IS THE STATE GET INCREASES EVERY YEAR HIGH COST AREAS THE LA THE BAY AREA SANTA BARBARA SAN DIEGO GET NO INCREASE. SO FORTUNATELY THERE'S A PRETTY EASY SOLUTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS COME UP WITH WHICH IS THE DO WHAT. WE FOR COMMUNITY OFFICE FOR THAN BUYERS WHICH IS JUST A SIM OF THE IN WERE SHE'S CáC. BUT THREE POINT THREE THREE PER FOR A ONE DOLLAR. THAT BY. OUR PROCESS THAT IS WERE ALL THE BURKE. IT NEED IN TEN ALLEGEDLY WHICH THE SUPPORT FOR HIS WEAPON AB INCREASE K. AND OR FAT AND EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR- IN SUPPORT FOR THIS AWESOME FIX TO A VEXING. THAT'S BEEN A FOR AWHILE. THE THANK I'M NEXT WE CAN DIRECTOR. THANK YOU ASK NANCY PARCHMAN DIRECTOR DDS- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND INCLUDES AS THAT THE CHAIR HAD NOTED THAT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT INCLUDED THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTAL FUND SO IS A PARTIAL YEAR LAST YEAR THAT WAS FUNDED FOR SIX- FOR CURRENT YEARS SIX MONTHS. AND SO THE- GOVERNOR'S- BUDGET HAS THE- FULL IMPACT OF THE ACTION LAST YEAR INTO- GOING INTO BUDGET YEAR SO WE WOULD BE- ADDING THAT THAT'S- INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. IN ADDITION IT IS THAT AS IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICE CODES- THAT WE'RE PROPOSING- THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. ONE I HAVE SORRY HAVE TO. GET THE CALENDAR IN MY HEAD- AND THOSE THREE SERVICE CODES AND THEY WERE INFORMED BY OUR UPDATED RATE MODELS WE HAD- WITH FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY. THAT WE HAD UPDATED THOSE RATE MODELS AS A BASED ON THAT WE- PRIORITIZE AND IDENTIFY THREE SERVICE CODES THAT WE INCLUDED AND WAS INFANT DEVELOPMENT EARLY START THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AN INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES. AND SO FOR- BUDGET YEAR IT'S EIGHTEEN MILLION TOTAL FUND TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND- WHICH IS AGAIN REFLECTIVE OF HALF YEAR- TWO OF THOSE SERVICE CODE WOULD BE AT A POINT 2% AND THEN THE EARLY START THERAPEUTIC SERVICES WOULD BE AT THE 5% WHICH AGAIN WAS INFORMED BY THE- UPDATED RATE STUDY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST TO CLEAR FINE POINT ON WHY THE BUDGET REFLECTS HALF YOUR COST FOR THE THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICE CODES IS DO THE NECESSARY- FEDERAL CMS APPROVAL SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A HAPPIER COST CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET ACT AND THE ANNUALIZED COST THOUGH FOR THERE'S THREE THREE SERVICE CODES IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION TOTAL FUND AND TWENTY ONE POINT SIX GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU. HELLO. THANK YOU I'M THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ISSUES DISCUSSED IN THIS IN THIS SECTION OF THE HEARING SO I'D LIKE TO JUST A COMMENT ON FOUR DIFFERENT POINTS FIRST WE I JUST WANT TO RECAP SOME OF THE COMMENTS WE HAD MADE ABOUT THE RATE STUDY ONE THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE. SORT OF A QUANTIFIABLE MEASURE OF THE FUNDING GAP IN THE SYSTEM. TO THAT THE RATE STUDY WAS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. AND THREE THAT THE- THIS IS THE SECOND BUDGET THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY. THE SECOND POINT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE TODAY IS THAT OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR THE THREE- FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES FOR THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICES- THIS REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN LAST YEAR TO APPROVE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES. I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR OFFICE STILL HAS CONCERNS HOWEVER ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ONGOING SERVICES SUBJECT TO A SUSPENSION- EVEN THOUGH THAT SUSPENSION HAS BEEN DELAYED BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THIRD SOME COMMENTS ON THE MINIMUM WAGE THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS REALLY- CREATED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FOR THE SYSTEM. ONE IS THE ISSUE OF COMPACTION AND THAT'S LIKELY AFFECTING OTHER SERVICES ELSEWHERE TOO. IN OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT A UNIQUE THE- ISSUE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY IS THIS THIS CORK IN LOST SO NOT ONLY DO THE PROVIDERS IN THE HIGH COST AREAS NOT ONLY ARE THEY UNABLE TO GET A RATE ADJUSTMENT. TO HELP COVER THE COSTS OF THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES THEY ALSO ARE INELIGIBLE TO REQUEST FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH STATE MINIMUM WAGES. THERE ARE A COUPLE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS- WHAT WE DUBBED THE CORK IN LAW- WHAT ONE WOULD BE TO- SIMPLY DO SOME STATUTORY CLEAN UP TO ALLOW THOSE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS THE CURRENT ADJUSTMENTS UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS THE SECOND WOULD BE A PROPOSAL ALONG THE LINES OF MISTER FRASIER'S AND MR HOLDINGS AND THE ASSOCIATED ADVOCATES- WELL OUR OFFICES NOT CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THREE POINT 3% IS- AT THE RIGHT AMOUNT WE HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT THEIR OVERALL- COST ESTIMATE WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS ABOUT IN LINE WITH WHAT WE WOULD HAVE CALCULATED. A AND THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS RAISED IN THE AGENDA THAT WE DIDN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT- BUT I'LL JUST MENTION IT BRIEFLY IS THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE A- SYSTEMATIC WAY OF COLLECTING DATA. ABOUT CONSUMERS IN ABOUT SERVICES- THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THE UNMET SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ARE WE DON'T KNOW IF CONSUMERS HAVE THE CHOICES- OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT THEY'D LIKE. A WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT QUALITY. AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THINGS ARE BEING DONE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS REGIONAL CENTERS WHETHER THEY'RE COLLECTING DATA IN THE SAME WAY- EVEN CONSIDERING SERVICE CODES IN THE SAME WAY. THANK YOU I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH THAT ISSUE AND MORE TO DISCUSS LATER SO- WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN REVERSE- CARL LONDON HERE REPRESENT THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH ID DE. HAS ONE MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS- FIRST FOUR ONE EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR BOTH MR HOLDEN'S. IN A LETTERMAN COALITIONS PROPOSALS WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND BELIEVE THOSE ARE BOTH- EXCELLENT- APPROACHES TO SOLVING SUMMER PROBLEMS. WANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE AGAIN JUST REMINDER SO SOME THE STATISTICS WE KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACT. OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR SYSTEM. AND IT STARTS IN THE SYSTEM WITH A REAL FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE STAFF. IF ALL YOU DID WAS A SIMPLE PROBLEM. YOU LOOK TO THE FACT WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE SYSTEM. AND YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE STATE AFTER THE RATE STUDY NOW SAYS THE- THE SYSTEM ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. THE MAP ON THAT ALONE IF ALL YOU DID WAS TELL EVERY WORKER IN THE SYSTEM YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER PERSON. IN THE NEXT- AHEAD WITH THE TURNOVER RATES GO HIGHER BE EASIER YES THE- ABSOLUTELY. SO YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS MY GOES YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM ALREADY THAT HAS TO PAY OUT. EIGHTY FIVE CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR. TO THE PEOPLE WHO STAFF THE SYSTEM ANY DOLLARS YOU GIVE GO STRAIGHT TO PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE SYSTEM. TODAY WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STAFF ALMOST 80% OF THEM ARE WOMEN. MOST OF THEM WORK TWO OR MORE JOBS MOST OF THEM ARE A GOOD PORTION THAT MORE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. ALL FORMS OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FOOD MEDI CAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS. IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM- PROGRAMS THAT TODAY. ON THE VERGE OF CLOSURE BECAUSE OF RATESI'M AWARE OF SOME AND MISS RUBIO'S DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE. THAT ARE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF CLOSURE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY CLOSE. WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NO WHERE TO GO ANY LONGER. THEY GO RIGHT BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTER WHO THEN US TO FIND THEM A PROGRAM AND GUESS WHAT. EVERY PROGRAM WE FIND FOR THEM AFTER THAT POINT IS MORE EXPENSIVE. THAN THE ONE WE JUST CLOSED. THAT IS TRUE INSANITY BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN MS RUBIO'S DISTRICT. VERY SHORTLY UNDER THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE- THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS ON THE RATE INCREASES. WOW WHAT AN UNFAIR OUTCOME FOR THESE FOLKS THAT. WHERE THE DEPARTMENT FOUND THROUGH PUBLIC COMMENT THAT THE RATES THEY HAD PUT OUT WERE TOO SHORT. FOR THOSE THREE PROGRAMS. THE BENEFIT IN THE REWARD IN THE PENALTY THEY GET ALL THE SAME FELL SWOOP IS. YES WE DISCOVERED. THAT WOULD BE WORK FUND YOU ENOUGH TO THIS RAY STUDY PRO. BE THE PUBLIC TOLD US. WE HADN'T DONE THIS CORRECTLY. YOUR WORDS YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE NOTHER YEAR. GET THE BENEFIT OF OUR COPIES THAT'S- REDUCE. HELLO THING I SEE IT I BE YOUR LONG. NOW FIFTEEN YOU'RE LOOKING ON THIS. RUSHED WE NOW HAVE. SIX THANKS FOR WILL GRAB APPROVED ALL. WHAT WE BUILD IT AND WE WOULD THIS. FEDERAL APPROVAL. WE WERE BACK TO THE- ONE THE FED GOVERNMENT IF. APPROVAL CAN. ON JULY FIRST. HOUSE THIS IS A SHE HIM TO CUT THESE RATE INCREASES TO HALF YEAR THAT'S ALL THIS DOES IS DELAY. A HALF YEAR THESE RATE INCREASES. I I'D WE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH IN THIS AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THOSE POINTS AS YOU CONSIDER THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR AND THEN IF WE CAN TRYING KEEP YOUR- COMMENTS.

DIRECTOR DIRECTIONS REGIONAL CENTERS I'M SURE BRIDGE TO PROVIDE YOUR SIR SUFFERING THANK YOU. FOR LISTENING THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARK LANSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK- SEE IF SOMEONE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES BE INCLUDED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATE INCREASES. FOR NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THAT USE AYE ALAS AT AN AVERAGE COST OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED. SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH- IT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT SERVICE WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON ACHIEVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE RECEIVING SERVICES WHY WAIT SIX MONTHS WE RIGHTED THE RATE NOW LET'S WRITE THE DATE. PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. ON AND SHOULD NOT BE TOLD TO WAIT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENTS. JULY FIRST I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DO JANUARY FIRST IMPLEMENTED- IMPACTING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT- THERE'S NO REASON TO WAIT- SO WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT- MOVING THAT FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO I'M JACKI DOLLARS AWESOME I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STEP PROGRAM. AND I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA AROUND YOU. CAN SEE THAT REALLY WELL SO MY- SCHOOL ROLL OFF MY TONGUE. THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE CLOSER THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IT'S BEEN MIGHT WORK OF MY PASSION FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I DO WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A SAD ASSUMPTION THAT WE MADE IN OUR SYSTEM. THE PROMISE THAT WE ARE A WITH MINIMUM WAGE INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALL FIGHTING TO BE RECOGNIZED TO GET THE FUNDING WE NEED TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE WHAT EVERY PROVIDER IN THE ROOM REALIZE IS. OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ARE WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU TO MAKE SURE MY LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES MATT. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO RATES IN MY FOR MY SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ONE FOR THEIR WICKS STAFF AND ONE FOR THE ASLEEP STAFF. I GET PAID THIRTY CENTS MORE AN HOUR. ON MY A SLEEP RATE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH STAFF ARE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THEY SLEEP. SO IT'S KIND OF A- A BACKWARD ASSUMPTION THAT WERE FIGHTING ON AND IT FEELS REALLY- CHALLENGE YOU TO EVEN THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THE DRUG SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ARE MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEES YOU'RE GOING TO WE'RE LOSING SO MANY PEOPLE JUST ON THAT VERY BASIC PREMISE. SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR TAKE IT ON WE NEED TO FIX IT- THE OTHER ONE IS INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES THAT'S HOW I STARTED MY CAREER. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. IOS SERVICES IT'S A PROGRESSIVE INNOVATIVE SERVICE. THE AVERAGE COST AS I LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS YESTERDAY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE DOLLARS A MONTH. THEY DIDN'T FIX THE RATE STUDY PER SE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIX THE WAGE. THEY FIX THE PERCENTAGES. I WOULD STILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN MY RATE IF THE RATE STUDY WAS IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THAT NEW ASSUMPTION. IF TALKING ABOUT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MOST INCLUSIVE SERVICE OF ALL. AND WE CAN'T FIX IT. SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

SERVICES AND SOME WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE GETTING GREAT SERVICE AND OTHERS WOULD SAY THAT THEIR PROVIDER WOULD NOT SHOW UP OR WERE THEY WERE.

THE FORM I THINK I SAID THIS THREE WILL YET LARA COURSE OF THE WAY THAT THE- SERVICES ARE DISTRIBUTED TED AND THE RESOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED. IN THIS BESSIE L. AND ESPECIALLY LIKE ALI THAT THE LIBERAL WITH ORDERS THE QUALITY OF THE PROVIDERS. IT IS THAT IDEA IN OUR AREA I PUT OVER THE OTIS GUESS IN YET ANOTHER SET OF FEATURES ON A THREAT FROM MEDIA THERE ARE SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT DO NOT- HAVE SERVICES FOR OUR pFAMILIES. THAT WOULD NOT COMMIT TO SERVICES TO OUR FAMILIES WHAT GUESTS ON CASTLE WE SAY THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY MAY BE SEVERE CASES OF AUTISM- BUT GUESS SO GAS IS GOING TO THAT OTHERS WHO LIVE WITH OR BECAUSE THE THEY ARE CONSIDERED- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A LIGHT DISABILITY. IT WAS GOOD TROUBLED ADDRESS FROM YES I HAVE FOUND I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER FAMILIES GET PORK A LAST SECOND CS THAT BECAUSE THE AGENCIES IS DONE WITH LOCALS AND- LIBERAL LOS SERVICIOS THAT THE AGENCIES.

THANK YOU- MISTER TERRY AGAIN WHEN- WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OUR SYSTEM IN FISCAL DISCUSSIONS AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE RATES- WE ARE HAVING AN INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS- AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO- OUTLINE- SOMETHING THAT AREAS SO MUCH I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON. IS THE SO A WOMAN'S ARE GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL TO OUR DISCUSSIONS AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE ON ON THE AREAS THAT I HAD RELEASED PREVIOUSLY STATED- SO WILL WE'LL BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM WORK GROUPS AND THEN SO TAKING A LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE TO PROGRAM- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SHORTLY. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF THE MEMBERS PROPOSALS AND ADVOCATES PROPOSALS- SPECIFICALLY IF I COULD THE EARLIER START DATE FOR THE THREE CODE. AS WELL AS A MINIMUM WAGE PARK. SO REGARDING THAT THE PROPOSAL'S NOT OUR PROPOSALS YOU KNOW AND CERTAINLY ANYANYTHING THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE US TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DO THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE DETAIL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON. PROTECTION OF COSTS BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ADDITIONAL THAT CAN BE INFORMATIVE- ARE HELPFUL AND YOUR ANALYSIS THAT THAT DATA THAT WE HAVE WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT. RATE FROM. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS IF NOT I HAVE A REQUEST- AND IT WAS WHAT THE LA- HAD MENTIONED AT THE CLOSE OF HER COMMENTS REGARDING DAY- IT'S AN ITEM THAT WE- SEE THROUGHOUT OUR AGENDA HERE TODAY. BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE A MEANINGFUL STEP ON DATA IN THE DVDS SOME. UNDERSTANDING THAT IN A MORE UNIFORM WAY STATEWIDE. WE NEED INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED. AS WELL AS FAMILY SATISFACTION ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION. RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DATA GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR TO CREATE A UNIFORM DATA WAREHOUSE THAT WILL ASSIST WITH TRANSPARENCY. AND OUTCOME ORIENTED SYSTEM PROGRESSION CAN I ASK THE LA- TO WORK WITH DDS AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF TO AID US IN CONSTRUCTING DRAFT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE TOWARDS THE SCHOOL. I SEE TWO HEADS SHAKING SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. OKAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLD. WHEN YOU'RE READY DIRECTOR A- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'LL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE AREAS ALL TOUCH ON- IN IN THE DISK AND WILL ALSO BE RELATED TO DATA. BECAUSE AN ELEMENT AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE THE DATE INTEGRITY- AND WHICH WE WOULD RELY ON AN IMPLEMENTATION AS PROGRAM SO AS THE AGENDA IS DOES NOTES THAT WE DO HAVE A READ STE. FOR A SEVENTY EIGHT. DOLLARS TOTAL FUND SIXTY IS- OF GENERAL FUND TO IMPLEMENT A NEW- PROGRAM FOR AN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS REALLY DESIGNED AND WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE VISION OF BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING. AND IT WOULD BE FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND WORKING- THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE COORDINATION AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A VERY INNOVATIVE FLEXIBLE. WAY HOWEVER IT WOULD BE VERY TIED TO ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT AND- BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AS FAR AS THE GOALS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OURS. DOES IT TOO MAKE SOME SOME SIR REGARDING A EMERALD DOES MOVE. THEM FOR AND TAKE A LOOK AT HOW DO WE STEPPED OUR CULTURE IT. IS TO HELP BRING SERVICE AND ONLY FOR THOSE SIR. NINE IT OUT. MUCH ONLY THOSE ALSO ARE REALLY COOL. SEVEN SO WE DID. I'M AND WE STILL HAVE AN APP FOR CONTRACT ON THAT PERFORMANCE CONTRACT IS STILL VERY ON THE HOW IT IS VERY TIGHT MORE CA MEASURES AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE ARE REALLY LOOKING TOO THIN AS IS TIED TO COME AND- SURE I'M AT POSE I'M JUST BUT AN CONNECT I KIND OF THOUGHT IN CANADA ACCOUNTABILITY PIZZAS SO THE PROGRAM ON THE CALL THE OF THE OUTCOME AND RESULTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE. COME RIGHT TO THAT I'M REALLY. ADDRESSING THE SERVICE. AND DISPARITIES THAT SYSTEM IS FACE A WE'RE GONNA TALK SOME MORE ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE AGENDA THE IMPORTANCE OF. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES ARE AND CERTAINLY SEEN THOSE ACCESS ISSUE. ON THE OTHER ELEMENT AS AS WAS NOTED AS FAR AS THE DATA SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND HELPING THE REACHED CENTER ALSO SAYS THE STATE. IS IT WHITE RICE THE THAT IS BE ABLE TO. SO WE- SURE THAT WHATEVER PER FROM MEASURES THAT ARE GOING TO PURSUE. IN GOING FORWARD THAT WE CAN REALLY RELY ON THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO DO THE MEASUREMENT AND TIE IT TO INCENTIVES. SO THE STRATEGIES THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON BECAUSE WE'VE WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS ARE STAKEHOLDER. AS A CHAIR HAD NOT HAD OF THE- THING ABOUT OUR SYSTEM IS REALLY BRING GAUGE METAL ARE STAKEHOLDER. DE AND CREATING AN N. AS IN THE VALUE. A BRING TO THAT WELL IN AND HELPED US IDENTIFY THOSE PRIORITIES. SO IN THOSE COPS ASIAN ENDS IT DID COME FORWARD AT. TAKEN HOW TO HELP. MAKE THAT WE HAVE SOME IN. IS ABLE TO A COMES AND THOSE X. ALL GIVING EXAMPLE. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK IT TAKE UP AND CROSS THE STATE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE HI MY ACCESS TO TAKE. AND THAT WERE ABLE TO BE ABLE NOT ONLY DOES YOUR- IN ONE. THAT THEY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME HAVING THE SAME INFORMATION IF THEY GO FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER TO THE NEXT REGIONAL CENTER. SO THESE INFORMATION PACKETS IF YOU WILL REALLY DO TO CUT A TOUCH ON THAT MAKING SURE THAT EVER GOES THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR. IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION AND THE CONTINUITY. THEN TOOK A- STEP IS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. A REAL TIME SURVEY. I COULD DELIVER TO DO THE FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING THROUGH AND TAKE THAT CAN GO AHEAD AND IN REAL TIME NBA. TO INDICATE IN SAY FIVE TO EIGHT DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WHAT NEXT AND DID YOU GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED. OUTSTANDING QUESTION DO YOU UNDER THE OUTCOME IN YOUR- ABILITY- SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE DEFINITELY LINKED WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN BEER. TO START THE- PROCESS BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO. SECURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS CONCEPT. SO A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS PROGRAM. IS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK HOW DO WE SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS- WE DO RECORD. OBVIOUSLY ARE. THOSE THAT WE WANT- FOR CASELOADS WERE IN TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST CHILDREN THAT ARE THREE. OR AND- SOLD. TRACKING BRITAIN'S THE- REYES ARE PROPOSED FOR. LITTLE LATER YOU IS ONE TO FOUR. FIVE BUT WE- NEED TO DECIDE SAID EARLIER WE HAVE A- DIFFERENT. SO YOU MIGHT THAT EXPERTISE TO NAVIGATE THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. SO AGAIN TO KIND OF. TAKE YOU INTO THE SYSTEM AND THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE HAD PARTICULARLY FOR OUR YOUNGER FAMILIES. IS THAT OVER THE MANY YEARS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE SHIFTED ABA SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM TOO MANY CAL OR TO THEIR HEALTH PLANS IT IS NOT AN EASY SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR DO YOU HAVE EXPERTISE. FOR THIS COURT ERRORS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE TO- WORK AND HELP AND SUPPORT IN OUR- MEETINGS OR SOMEBODY THAT HAS THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO HELP A FAMILY CONNECT TO A HEALTH PLAN OR TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO. THOSE SERVICES THOSE CHEN SOURCES OF DEPEND ON AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON IS HURRY THE CONCEPT IS THAT MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BASE FUND. THERE WERE ALSO WOULD. THERE'S JEEZ EIGHT NAY TO MOVE. AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT PRESCRIBE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THEIR STRATEGY DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS OF. RED COAST CENTER IS V. ROLE RURAL FOR HOUSE INDIVIDUALS DE SER. TO IT PAGE ON YOU HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND AND- OR. TO IN OUR CASE LOAD SO WE COULD APPROACH CASELOADS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE NEEDS OF THE PERSONS THAT THEY'RE SERVING. SO THIS WOULD GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT ALSO WOULD STILL BE H. CBS COMPLAINTS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL RULE. BASED ON WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE IN THOSE AT ARMS SO THOSE ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT WE SEE NO OVER THE NEXT. FOUR MONTHS AS I IT SAID THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GONNA BE IDENTIFIED THAT THEY CAN HELP US IDENTIFY THOSE PRIORITIES. AND THEN THOSE PER- PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE WOULD BE USING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. AND THEN WORK THROUGH THOSE METRICS AYE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TIE THOSE INCENTIVES. AND SO TO JUST TO HELP YOU SEE THE PICTURE OF THIS WE WOULD SEE THAT ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION. AND AT THE NEXT FOR THE BASE FOR THAT READ. CAN TO ANSWER THAT THEY- THE SERVER COORDINATOR CLOSE SELECT. HELP NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PORT MERRY. IS IT OUT THERE. AND DEAN OF. WENT SAID. YES 70% AT AND HAVING THE TWO FIVE SIGNED THAT WOULD BE TÁI. THOSE A- IT WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE EVERY RESULTS AND IS ON BEING ABLE TO MEASURE TO THEIR STAY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO WE DON'T WANT TO PUT AND TO PROBLEM WHERE A REGIONAL CENTER IS GOING TO HAVE TO COMPARED TO AN THE RESULT AND IT'S A EXPLAINED AND THEY DON'T OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE SO SURE IT'S NUMBER FIVE RESOURCE CENTER HELP EXPECTATION OF BE HELD ON THE A. K. FORTY THAT. TO BE AT TO READ THOSE. CITED A- DATE DO SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES- WHERE IT'S NEEDED TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND ALSO INVEST IN AND DOING THE THINGS THAT HAVE DONE IT I'D AS FAR AS THE DATA INTEGRITY SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY AND THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FIND. FOR AT FURTHER TETANUS RICHARD THANK YOU HELLO. THANK YOU SONYA PADDICK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE ACTUALLY DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND INSTEAD THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE VISION OF THE SYSTEM AS WE TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL ISSUES AGO. THE REASON WE RECOMMEND REJECTION IS NOT BECAUSE THE IDEA DOESN'T HAVE MERIT BUT WE FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO BE THINKING ABOUT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT FUND UP THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED I'M IT ALSO MEANS THAT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS MADE THAT. WE NOT RATE QUESTION AT THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT- AND THAT INSTEAD TALKING ABOUT FISCAL REFORM A IT MAY BE THE TOP PRIORITY AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE ALSO DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN TALKING ABOUT QUALITY WE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY OR OPENLY TALKING ABOUT FISCAL REFORM. THERE REALLY TWO DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE IS ABOUT QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AND ANOTHER IS ABOUT USING INCENTIVES TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THAT'S JUST ONE WAY TO TRY TO ACHIEVE QUALITY IN THE SYSTEM INCENTIVE PAYMENTS YOU CAN STILL. TRY TO ACHIEVE QUALITY WITHOUT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. I'M SO IN FACT I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FOR HOW YOU MIGHT PURSUE QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS IN OTHER WAYS RIGHT NOW. ONE IS BETTER OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEM AND IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY- IRAN TO FACILITATE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER IS TO REVISE THE REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS WHICH IS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO RESTRUCTURE SOME OF THE CURRENT APPROPRIATIONS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY HAS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM- THAT THE THAT THE IN THE SYSTEM FOR A COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER THAT PROGRAM HAS NOT. REALLY TAKEN OFF THE WAY I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE IT TO YOU. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO RESTRUCTURE THAT PROGRAM AND ALMOST USE IT AS A PILOT TEST OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. I'M YOU COULD CONSIDER DOING ANOTHER TYPE OF PILOT TEST OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS RATHER THAN APPROVING A OF A SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION TO DO THIS- ON A NON PILOT TEST BASIS. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT MANY IN THE FORM OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL BE THE PRIMARY MOTIVATOR FOR MANY REGIONAL CENTER AND SERVICE PROVIDER EMPLOYEES. THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. SUIT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY WORK OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS- WITHOUT. AT USING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT. YOU JUST. MAKING A DECENT WAGE FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO IMPROVE QUALITY. SO I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT FROM OUR OFFICES INITIAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE APPEARS MIXED ON WHETHER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE PUBLIC CONTEXT ARE ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT THEY CAN GO WRONG. AND THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. FINALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NOT TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE ACTUAL PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT FORWARD AND TO AVOID POTENTIAL PITFALLS THE DESIGN AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE PARAMOUNT AND THE LEGISLATURE TO TIED TO PROCEED AND APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL WE WRECKED THEY REQUIRE MORE DETAIL THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT ENVISIONS THE PRO I'M ACTUALLY WORKING ABOUT THE PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND ABOUT HALF BUT APART. WELL YOU A PROBLEM IN SO MAKE PREVENTS ON LIVE BASIS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HILL HERE FROM KATIE HORNBERGER. HI THANK YOU UP SO I'M GETTING REFER BURGER FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS RATES ADVOCACY AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND OF YOUR WE ACTUALLY- OR- REALLY SORT OF BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN AND- BUT WE ALL SORT OF KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND DOES SO AND YOU SAID NOT A LOT OF DETAILS TO DATE. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE DETAILS MIGHT BE AND I THINK SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ON IT REALLY WANT OF ROPE STE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR THE RICH CENTERS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST THAT THERE ARE SO. SYSTEM I PREFER COMMENCEMENT THAT UP TO THE REGION CENTERS AND THERE'S DEPENDING ON MEASURE OF PROGRAM CAN'T BE. IT WOULD HAVE TO ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THAT THAT ALL PARTICIPATE. ON THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE HAVE PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE MEASURE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE OUR SYSTEM FORWARD AND NOT AND THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT- I THINK WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY THAT ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN OUR SYSTEM AND ONE THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS THAT WE OFTEN. THE TRANSPARENCY IS LACKING IN IT'S HARD SEE WHERE WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REALLY READ THESE HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING- WHEN I READ IT I SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S EXPECTED OF MY REGIONAL CENTER. UP WE ALSO. HAVE AS NANCY SAID THAT THE EXACT MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE CENTER TO THE NEXT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ONE CENTER TO COME IN ALREADY MEETING THE GOAL. AND ANOTHER REALLY HAVE IT BE AN UNATTAINABLE GOAL. SO THE EXACT MEASURE WOULD BE DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT AND THOSE DIFFERENCES WOULD BE BASED ON- BASS LINES THAT ARE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AT THE START OF THE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALSO NEEDS TO BE BASED ON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE CORE VALUES OF OUR PROGRAM- WE'VE- HAVE REALLY ESTABLISHED CORE VALUES WITHIN THE LAN TURMAN ACT. ON IT OUT THINGS- YOU KNOW ERIC SEGMENT TALKED EARLIER ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THAT THIS REALLY IS A PROGRAM. TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE EQUAL LIVES AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT. LOOKING AT BIG PICTURE TOPICS LIKE EMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY INTEGRATION REDUCTION OF SERVICE DISPARITIES CHOICE. ON AND OF COURSE BECAUSE IT IS COMING H. CBS COMPLIANCE. UP OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE FOCUS ON MAYBE THREE OF THESE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND PARTICULAR I'M AS THE PROGRAM IS GETTING UP AND RUNNING AND WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO- ASSESS THE DATA. COULD EVEN PICK THREE WHERE THE DATA IS MORE EASILY OBTAINABLE FOR EXAMPLE H. CBS COMPLIANCE WHERE WERE GATHERING THAT DATA ANYWAY. ALL YOU KNOW THE SAME MAY BE TRUE WITH- COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT ON AND EVEN WITHIN POS DISPARITIES AND I KNOW WE HAVE A WHOLE SECTION LATER ON THAT. UP BUT WE ALSO NEED TO NOT O THIS IN A VACUUM IT HAS TO BE PART OF A COORDINATED INITIATIVE WITH ALL OF THE- THINGS WERE GOING IN OUR SYSTEM. TO BE EFFECTIVE. UP WE ALSO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ON THE DATA AND I WAS GLAD TO HEAR YOU- ASKING THAT THEY REALLY WORK ON COMING UP WITH THAT AT DATA SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK ESTABLISHING THAT THAT BASELINE DATA IS GOING TO BE INTEGRAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. UP AND THEN WE THINK ABOUT REPORTING IT REALLY SHOULD BE AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND WAY. BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE SUCCESS TO THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THE SERVICES THEY HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. UP AND OF. PART OF THAT IS DEVELOPING IT IN CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS- I WILL SAY I WAS PLEASED TO SEE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS- THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CAN BE USING THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM GROUP AND THEN ALSO THE OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY GROUP WITHIN THE- DS TASK. FORCE TO THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS AND WAS EVEN MORE PLEASED TO HEAR YOU SAY TODAY THAT THERE WILL BE ACTUAL GOALS TO RESPOND TO BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES THESE LARGE TOPICS ARE BROACHED AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. BUT IF YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING CONCRETE TO RESPOND TO YOU ACTUALLY CAN HEAR WHAT STAKEHOLDERS THANK. SO ONCE AGAIN I'M WE APPRECIATE THAT MINISTRATIONS EFFORTS AND THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO BRING OUT COMES TO OUR SYSTEM- AS WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE REALLY VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE ALISON MARIN'S. MY NAME IS ALLISON RANTS- MY FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON MIKE A IS A CLIENT OF SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER AND I'M SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE AS A BOARD MEMBER OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE USE OF PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES I'M ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FRUSTRATIONS THAT WE HEAR FROM FAMILIES AND SELF ADVOCATES. IS IT REGIONAL CENTERS DON'T PRIORITIZE ACTIVITIES THAT IMPROVE THEIR WELL BEING. INSTEAD WE OFTEN HEAR THAT REGIONAL CENTERS PRIOR TO HIS ACTIVITIES THAT IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF REGIONAL CENTERS- BUT OF COURSE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT COMPENSATE REGIONAL CENTERS BASED ON HOW WELL THEY IMPROVE OUTCOMES. FOR THE CONSUMERS THEY SERVE. THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO IS FOR NEW FISCAL INCENTIVES TO BE EXPLICITLY TIED TO CONSUMER CENTERED PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THAT BEING SAID. WE SHARE IT DRC'S CONCERNS WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. FIRST WE FEEL THAT MAKING PARTICIPATION VOLUNTARY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM AND IN FACT COULD EVEN MAGNIFIED DISPARITIES BY ALLOWING LOW PERFORMING REGIONAL CENTERS. TO OPT OUT AND ESSENTIALLY SETTLE FOR MEDIOCRITY AND THOSE THAT DID CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE- THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY CHOOSE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT- SO WE THINK CONSUMERS DESERVE MORE AND THE PROGRAM MUST BE MANDATORY FOR ALL REGIONAL CENTERS. A IN A BIND SOME OF THE COMMENTS THE GRAB BAG APPROACH TOWARDS GOAL SETTING IN WHICH EACH REGIONAL CENTER GETS TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH GOALS THAT WANTS TO WORK TOWARDS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT REGIONAL CENTERS ANNUAL PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS IN YEAR AND REPORTS ALL OF WHICH ARE ON DDS IS WEBSITE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'LL FIND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A HODGE PODGE OF BENCHMARKS THE VERY TERM REGIONAL CENTER TO REGIONAL CENTER SOMETIMES EVEN FROM TWO YEAR AND OR NOT CONSISTENTLY MEASURED OVER TIME WE KNOW OF THIS APPROACH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO ACCOUNTABILITY. PERFECT OUTCOMES MUST BUILD ON CURRENT POLICY INITIATIVES POINT PICKING UP AND YOUR SEATS COMMENTS AND MUST BE UNIFORM ACROSS THE SYSTEM NOW TO BE CLEAR AND THIS PICKS UP A DOCTOR BARGES COMMENTS DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTER NOT ALL DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE SAME WAY EVEN THOUGH IT BE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL FOR EXAMPLE ONE REGIONAL CENTER MAY DECIDE TO IMPROVE COMPETITOR GRATED POINT. I HAVE DURING ADICIONAL IN HOUSE EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST ANOTHER MAY PARTNER WITH CA BASED ORGANIZATION OR LOCAL BUSINESSES WE ARE ALL IN A VERY SERVICE VERY FACT I THINK THE THING WE WANT ENCOURAGE THAT KIND OF IN A- HOWEVER. WE DON'T CENTERS THESE. FOR THE SAME SET OF GOALS AND THEY SHOULD BE MEASURED IN THE SAME WAYS AND I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA COLLECTION ISSUES THAT I'M NOT GOING TO. YOU KNOW SAY IT AGAIN. BUT YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE IDEAS ESSENTIALLY A NON STARTER AND LESS WE CAN AT LEAST TO FIND A SET OF METRICS WE REALLY BELIEVE WE UNDERSTAND ARE TRANSPARENT. YOU KNOW I WANT TO ECHO ALL THOSE COMMENTS BUT WE ALSO AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY ALEJO. ON FIRST AND THIS IS A- HAS TO DO WITH THE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM OUTCOMES HAVE TO BE MEASURED WITH CLEAR OBSERVABLE MEANT METRICS. BUT WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO PRIORITIZE ONE OR TWO REALLY RELIABLE BENCHMARKS THIS YEAR. THAN TO POSTPONE ALL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS FULLY FUNDED. AFTER ALL THAT DAY MAY NEVER COME. SO WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD START SMALL AND BUILD FROM THERE. SECONDLY THE REGIONAL IT REGIONAL CENTER STAFF WHOSE BEHAVIOR MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTS OUTCOMES ARE THE ONES WHO NEED TO BE INCENTIVIZE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE THEMES THAT ELLIE- PICKED UP FROM THE RAND STUDY ON KIND OF WHAT HOW WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THOSE THAT DON'T. AGAIN WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THAT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT REWARDING EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAMS OF REGIONAL CENTERS THE REWARDS NEED TO GO TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THE HANDS ON WORK ESPECIALLY COORDINATORS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. WE BELIEVE THESE CONCERNS CAN AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN. THAT MOVES THE SYSTEM FORWARD TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE CONVEYS TO CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO THEM. ARE THE OUTCOMES THAT REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE REWARDED FOR HELPING TO BRING ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I MAY I ASK IF WE CAN HAVE SOME ROOM FOR IN THE WEST WING. PLEASE. WE WILL FOLLOW HER WITH PUBLIC COMMENTERS SO IF YOU HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WITH ISSUE THREE PREPARED COME UP SAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL. AS WE'VE HEARD THE GOALS OF CALIFORNIANS REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WORD TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. AND TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER WE HAVE MODIFIED THOSE OVER TIME AND THINK OF IT IS HELPING YOUNG CHILDREN MAKE DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRESS SUPPORTING FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME AND PROMOTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF ADULTS. AND IN THAT ROOM WE ARE STRIVING FOR BIGGER GOALS THAN WE EVER IMAGINE FIFTY YEARS AGO WE'RE LOOKING AT EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. AND THE FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FROM INSTITUTIONS TO SEGREGATION TO IMMIGRATION AND FINALLY TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF INCLUSION. RECENTLY AS THE SYSTEM WAS MOVING TOWARDS A WORLD AFTER DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE STARTED IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL POLICIES IN OUR WORLD WITH KIND OF A COMMON THEME TO THEM BUT THESE EFFORTS HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY ALIGNED. SO WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING SO THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CAN WORK WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO DEVELOP NEEDED SERVICES IN THEIR AREA. WE HAVE THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES TRANSITION GRANTS WHICH HELP MOVE SERVICES GROUP CLOSER TO- COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS AROUND INTEGRATION. WE HAVE THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THE COMMUNITY- THE C. I. A. INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THE DISPARITY GRANTS PROGRAMS SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE OPERATING IN THE SAME SPACE WITHOUT A COMMON THREAD. SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS FROM THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FROM THE LA JOH THE FIRST STEP IS REALLY TO. CLEARLY IDENTIFY LONG TERM GOALS AND THOSE GOALS NEED TO BE IN THE AREAS OF QUALITY ACCESS AND UTILIZATION ENSURING EQUITY. RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF CARE COORDINATION. PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND INTEGRATION. A SECOND WE NEED TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON THE SYSTEMIC MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES NOT JUST FOR REGIONAL CENTERS BUT FOR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WE HAVE LOTS OF TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THERE ARE THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS THE RIGHT ANSWER THE CEDAR WHICH IS A SYSTEM THAT WE USE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR THEIR DATA ELEMENTS THAT WE AREN'T COLLECTING AT. THIRD AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH ALREADY TODAY WE NEED TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON HOW TO CAPTURING COLLECT THAT DATA AND ANALYZE IT. AND FINALLY WE NEED TO DO WITH THE SYSTEM DOES BEST. WE NEED TO INNOVATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LEVEL EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EFFORTS. AND CONTINUE TO REFINE THEM OVER TIME. IN SHORT OUR SYSTEM IS DOING A LOT OF GOOD WORK NOW THAT PEOPLE RELY UPON. WHICH IS IN NEED OF STABILIZATION AS WE HEARD IN THE LAST PANEL. WE NEED STABILIZATION IN THE REALM OF SERVICE COORDINATION AND PROVIDER SUFFICIENCY AND MISS PATRICK NOTED THIS IN HER COMMENTS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AS WELL. BUT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN TIME AS AN EITHER OR PROPOSITION WE MUST WE MUST BOTH SUPPORT THE CRITICAL WORK OF TODAY BUT ALSO. LOOK AT SETTING A COURSE FOR THE FUTURE OF THE SYSTEM AND SUPPORTING IT TO MEET THE DYNAMIC AND MERGING NEEDS BEFORE US. THE PROPOSED PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM PRESENTS US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS WE COLLECTIVELY IDENTIFY WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN THE NEXT FIVE TEN AND EVEN FIFTY YEARS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS PROGRAM TAKE SHAPE. THANK YOU MA'AM WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. SIX PEOPLE. HELLO I'M I'M KAREN COLE I LIVE IN REDONDO BEACH- A MY SON DIDN'T WANT TO COME WITH ME HIS NAME IS MAGNUS AND HE'S FIFTEEN- HE THOUGHT IT BE BORING BUT I BROUGHT HIS PICTURE INSTEAD. WE HAVE A REALLY FUN LIFE- BUT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE BOUT THE REGIONAL CENTER THAT WE BELONG TO HELP REGIONAL CENTER. REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT IMPACT IN OUR LIFE A TOLL AND WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA I REALIZE THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYBODY. I WENT ONLINE TO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS TO THAT DISPARITY- TO A DATA IS POSTED ONLINE. AND I PLUGGED IN THE LONG GRASS AND I CAN SEE THAT WITH THE SECOND BOTTOM THE SPENDING ON CHILDREN. AS THREE TO TWELVE AND THE BOTTOM FOR SPENDING ON A ZERO TO SAY THE REGIONAL CENTER. BUT WE HAVE TO BE WITH DOESN'T SPEND VERY MUCH MONEY ON CHILDREN A TOLL- THEY DO BEST FOR ADULTS A LEAVE THIS FOR YOU IF YOU WANT. SO WHEN I TALK TO OTHER PARENTS IN THE IN THE AREA THEY- TELL ME I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER- WHEN I ASK THEM ABOUT. ADVOCATING FOR FUNDING FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER THEY SAY WELL THEY DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR US I'VE I'VE GIVEN UP ON THE REGIONAL CENTER IT'S TOO HARD WE HAVE TO GO TO FAT HEARING TO GET ANYTHING FROM THEM. IS WHAT THEY SAY- THE SERVICES WE GET. ARE EITHER THE WRONG SERVICES ALL OF THAT USELESS FOR EXAMPLE REST BY THE SERVICE MOST PEOPLE DO GET. AT A REST BY IS JUST UP AND ON TRACK- THEY HAVE US CPR CERTIFICATE. UP THE RUN TRYING THE NOT IN DEALING WITH PEOPLE WITH THE- BILL ITSELF. AND THAT THE ROCK BECAUSE THIS IS TO YOUR HOUSE. HI OUT NOT. YOUR MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE WHERE I LIVE. A REGULAR BABY SO. PROFESSIONAL BABY SITTER COST TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THAT'S NOT WAT THEY PAY THE REST BY WORKERS. SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ONE YOU CALL THE SERVICE THEY CALL IN THE MORNING AND SAY SORRY WE COUNSEL WE COULDN'T GET AND- THE- A WELCOME. WELL YOU CAN PROVIDE YOUR OWN RIGHT I WORK AT I CAN'T FIND ONE- BUT THE- THING IS IT LONG. THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THE HOME I WANT MY FACE YEAR OLD. YEAH THE BEACH AT THE CORE OF THE ME WITH HIS FOR. AND I CAN'T DO THAT WITH REST THANKS PARTLY THE REGIONAL SERVICES WE CAN'T DO THAT- I ASKED THEM. TO HAVE SOMEONE TAKE MY AND TO SCOUT SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE IS MOM WITH HIM NO FIFTY YEAR OLD BOY WANTS THEM MOM WITH THEM THAT SCOUTS RIGHT. IT REALLY IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR A SOCIAL SKILLS THEY SAID OH NO BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST BE IMPRESSED BUT WORKER. UNTRAINED WON'T DO THEM ANY GOOD. SEND THEM IN TO SOCIALS. THAT WAS TO YEARS AGO STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE SOCIAL SKILLS PROGRAM HE CAN JOIN WE'VE BEEN TO THREE INTERVIEWS BUT APPARENTLY HE CAUGHT THE SOCIAL SKILLS CLASS. IF YOU COME FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE BY HIMSELF. I ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO FILL OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE BY HIMSELF. SO IS THE WRONG SERVICES AND IT'S- AND THAT NOBODY IS TAKING ANY ACCOUNT. OF WHETHER THEY HAPPEN. OF WHETHER THEY GOOD WHAT THE QUALITY IS OR WHAT THE OUT COME FROM MY SON OR ANY OF THE OTHER CHILDREN IN HARPER. REGION IS WHAT WHY SHE HAPPENS TO THEM- BEHAVIOR SERVICES WE'VE HAD GOOD WE'VE HAD BAD. BUT NOW IT ALL HAS TO BE AN INSURANCE AND NOBODY THE REGIONAL CENTER CAN HELP ME. FIND A NEW PROVIDE A BECAUSE MY OLD BEHAVIOR PROVIDED THAT THE REGIONAL SANTEE USED TO. PAY FOR DOESN'T INSURANCE SHE THINKS THAT'S TOO HARD WORK I THINK IT'S TOO HARD TO. AND NOT BE THE BEACH CENTER CAN HELP ME WITH DEALING WITH INSURANCEAND SEE IS A GREAT IDEA. HOWEVER HAVE INSURANCE PAY FOR EVERYTHING BUT WE NEED HELP TO DEAL WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME MEN OTHER THAN THE ONE I JUST GAVE YOU WHICH IS. HOW MUCH MONEY. THREE SENTENCE MEANS WHICH IS HUGE. BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL IS FOR NO REASON THE TOLL. AND THEY NEED TO HAVE A HAVE SOME WAY TO MEASURE. WHETHER IS THAT SHE DOING ANYTHING. FOR JUST HAVING NOT FANCY OFFICE THANK YOU. YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AREA OTHERS WITH THIS COUNTS ON THE- THIS. THE QUEST OF. WHAT DO WE MEASURE TO MAKE SURE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED BY THE SYSTEM ARE IMPROVED BY THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU IN THE LEGISLATION GOVERNOR PUT IN THE SYSTEM. IS A QUESTION IT CAME FOR THE COUNCIL LAST YEAR AFTER SEEING THE RATE STUDY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IS A BIG NUMBER- IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AND THE QUESTION THE COUNCIL ASKED IS. WE BELIEVE THAT WILL RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES BUT HOW DO WE KNOW PEOPLE'S LIVES WILL BE IMPROVED. THE COUNCIL ISSUED A GRANT TO. ANSWER THIS QUESTION- IT WAS AWARDED TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK AND WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION SOUNDS ARE THERE MANY PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM IS PERFORMING. THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED IN THE WAY IT'S INTENDED TO WHICH IS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE OF INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES- WHAT DO A MEASURE. OF THE REGIONAL CENTER COMES IS A PROVIDER ARE COMES FROM THE COUNCIL'S RESPECTIVE IT EXPERIENCE OF BEING SIR THIS IS. AS WEIGHING OUT DID PROPOSE ON HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN. THE RIGHT MEASURES TO LOOK AT I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A COMMUNITY EFFORT UNDER WAY. TO PROVIDE- THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION- WITH OUR VIEW ON WHAT THOSE MEASURES WHAT SHOULD BE MEASURED- BATTLED IT'S BEING DONE BY. A GROUP F PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPING DISABILITIES WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND WITH PROVIDERS IN CONJUNCTION- TOGETHER AND WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU SIR. MARK MELISSA FROM CALIFORNIA SAID PUT IT LIVING NETWORK RECIPIENT OF THE GRANT FROM STATE COUNSELING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED ARE ADVISORY GROUP TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MEASURABLE OUTCOMES OF SERVICE SERVICES MIGHT BE- HOW TRAINING MIGHT LOOK LIKE FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS TO HELP ACHIEVE THOSE. OUTCOMES AND HOW TO COLLECT AND REPORT THAT DATA BACK TO YOU FOLKS- SO WE'VE- WE WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE ADVISORY GROUP WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINISHING UP. QUICKLY TO- WORK REALLY HARD ON ON ON DEFINING WHAT THOSE SERVICE- COMES MIGHT LOOK LIKE- AND- MOVE FORWARD WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT THAT WE HAVE FROM STATE COUNCIL BUT WE'RE HEARING THAT OUTCOMES AND MEASURE BILLS AND- IT'S A VERY. COMMON THEME SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S A THREE TIME. ON A ISSUE- AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR MORE ON ISSUE SIX ABOUT FACE TO WITH THIS PROJECT- SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. WELL MISTER CHAIR MEMBER JORDAN LENDS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OUR COMMUNITY POLLS IN CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. IMPROVING QUALITY IS WHAT EVERY BODY WANTS. NO QUESTION THERE. ARE AND WE CAN GET A THREE LEGGED HORSE TO RUN A LITTLE BIT FASTER. BUT I WOULD RATHER PRIORITIZE THE MAJORITY NOT NEGLECTING TO COMPLETELY BUT MAJORITY OF OUR FOCUS AND RESOURCES. ON GETTING A FOR LIKE A HORSE. CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP DISABILITIES IN THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE ON THREE LEGS RIGHT NOW. AS WE HEARD FROM THE FIRST BECAUSE THE MOTHER WHEN YOU'RE RESPITE PROVIDER. WHEN YOUR REST WORK IT DOESN'T SHOW UP WHICH HAPPENS. EVERY DAY TO THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY QUIT OR WE CAN'T HIRE ENOUGH. THAT'S THE CRISIS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FIX. AND WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOME INCLUDED A SIZEABLE BUDGET ITEM FOR A RATHER NEBULOUS PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ITEM. AND NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE MEDIA CRISIS. IT WAS FELT LIKE THE COMMUNITY AND THE REALITY. WASN'T BEING HEARD. MY CONCERN MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THAT THE NARRATIVE AND THE CONVERSATION IS MOVING TOWARDS AND IS SOLELY BEING CONSUMED BY THIS IDEA PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR UNDER FUNDING AND THEN THE DEVELOPER SERVICES TASK FORCE REPORT THAT'LL BE THAT THE PRIORITY AND IT'S IT IN IT'S IMPORTANT TOPIC BUT WE CANNOT NEGLECT THE CRISIS IN THE MEETING NEED HAPPY RIGHT NOW MISTER FRASIER'S PLAN WITH WHICH WE HOPE TO SHARE WITH YOU VERY SOON. WILL INCLUDE ITEMS OF INCENTIVES AND DATA GATHERING AND WE'RE EXCITED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BUT IT DOESN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE BIGGER ISSUE AT HAND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS BONNIE GAIL AND I'M IN THE PARENT OF A CHILD WHO IS A REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS I'M HERE REPRESENTING EDUCATE ADVOCATE AS STATEWIDE GRASSROOTS ORGAN ORGANIZATION AND WE SERVE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS I'M HERE TO SHARE STORY THAT IS RELEVANT TO ISSUE THREE THIS INVOLVES A DENIAL OF A REQUEST OF WHITE FOR WIPES FOR A FAMILY THAT WE SIR WHAT WAS WRITTEN FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER DOES NOT ON. THE DIGNITY OF THE PERSON THAT WE PURPORT THAT YOU PURPORT TO SERVE THEY WROTE PERSONAL CLEANSING WIPES ARE A CONVENIENCE ITEM AND REPLACE EITHER THE NEED TO LAUNDER A WASH CLOTH OR WHAT A PAPER TOWEL OR SIMILAR ITEM TO CLEANSE A PERSON. ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS ITEM AS DESCRIBED IS DESCRIBED AS TO DEVELOPING SERVICES THAT MEET CONSUMER NEEDS IN A PERSON CENTERED WAY THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PERSON AS A PERSON AT ALL. IT DOES NOT HONOR THEIR DIGNITY WHAT A PARENT OF A BABY BE ASKED TO YOU. TO WIPE THEIR BABY WITH A PAPER TOWEL OR WASHCLOTH. LET ALONE THAT THIS REQUEST INVOLVES A YOUNG ADULT. UNDER THE ADVOCACY FEEDBACK ON THIS ITEM IT IS LISTED TO DETERMINE IF SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED IN A WAY THAT REDUCED RACIAL OR ETHNIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. ONE OF THE THINGS TO ALSO CONSIDER IS IF THE SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED DIRECT DIFFERENTLY ACROSS REGIONAL CENTERS PERIOD THERE ARE REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS. IN REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE NO ISSUE GETTING A SERVICE LIKE WIPES AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHERS THAT DOWNS WE HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THIS PERSONAL NARRATIVE AS YOU DELIBERATE THE NEXT STEPS AND REMEMBER THAT WE VALUE THE HONOR AND DIGNITY OF THE PERSON THAT WE ULTIMATELY ADDRESS HERE. JAMIE DAVIS EXECUTIVE MARIN BUT DIRECTOR FOR MORE ADVENTURES IN CENTER FELL- THE MICROPHONE SEEM SHORT SO I HOPE EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME HER I'M SHORT. I CAME HERE BEFORE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF MY- EMPLOYEES. ON AN EARLIER ISSUE THE REASON I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT MY EMPLOYEES IS I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. SOME OF THEM I'VE KNOWN MY ENTIRE CAREER IN THE FIELD I'VE KNOWN THEIR FAMILIES I COULD DO A LITTLE FAMILY TREE CHART FOR USE FOR SOME OF THEIR FAMILIES. THAT'S HOW WELL I KNOW THEM. AND I CARE ABOUT THEM AS IF THEY WERE MY OWN FAMILY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ARE GOING TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE STARTING IN THE MIDDLE. AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE LA OWES REPORT THAT SAYS. WE'RE STARTING IN THE MIDDLE OF SENSUALLY WE DON'T HAVE THE MEANS. TO GET TO THESE OUTCOMES. ONE OF THE ISSUES I FACE IS I CANNOT AFFORD TO INNOVATE. I CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THE C. I. E. OR PIPP PROGRAMS MEANT TO INCENTIVIZE US TO INNOVATE. I MANAGED TO GET AN H. C. B. S. GRANT WHICH I FOUND TO BE A BURDEN IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. AND A BIG PAIN IN THE **** FRANKLY SORRY. I'M GLAD WE GOT IT AND IT HAS HELPED US BUT- YOU KNOW I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WOULD BE SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION TO YOU KNOW TRACK ALL THIS THESE THINGS AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY. WELL IT HAS IMPROVED OUR CULTURE TO BE MORE PERSON CENTERED AND I'M GLAD WE GOT IT AND I'M GLAD IT WAS AVAILABLE I DON'T THINK WE'LL APPLY FOR ANOTHER ONE. AND LIKE WAYS WITH PIPPEN C. I. E. AND ANY OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PROGRAM WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT. BECAUSE ALL OF OUR MONEY IS GOING TO PAY FOR OUR STAFF TO GET GOOD STAFF. TO WORK WITH OUR CLIENTS THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS THERE WE GO. MY NAME IS KEVIN ROUTE FROM MANOS AND I'M ALSO WORKING WITH C. ESALEN ESPECIALLY ON THE- A PROJECT THAT. THAT COUNSEL JUST MENTIONED. I WANNA MAKE JUST ONE POINT. FOR TALKING ABOUT OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE A HOUSE BUILT ON SAND. IF WE DO NOT HAVE OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY OUTCOMES. A CASE MANAGER AND NOT PROPERLY EXECUTE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SERVICES DO WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM JUDY MARK I AM A PARENT OF A TWENTY THRILLED WITH AUTISM I'M FROM LOS ANGELES- I STANDING HERE TOO I AM ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED IN AND ISTRONGLY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES. THIS SYSTEM CURRENTLY IS NOT WORKING IT'S NOT WORKING FOR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE THERE ARE I AM THE RECIPIENT OF MANY EMAILS. AND MANY PHONE CALLS AND MANY STORIES FOR PARENTS TO TELL ME THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPECTED BY REGIONAL CENTER STAFF THEY'RE NOT RESPECTED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS THEY FEEL INTIMIDATED WHEN THEY COMPLAINED. I'M AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT AND WE CAN ONLY CHANGE THAT BY INCENTIVIZING GOOD BEHAVIOR WE HAVE TO JUST LIKE WE DO WITH CLIENTS WERE YOU WE INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR BY GIVING THEM AWARDS WE NEED TO REWARD. THOSE GOOD PROVIDERS AND WE NEED TO REWARD GOOD STAFF AT REGIONAL CENTERS AND WE AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT THROUGH A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO INVEST IN A SYSTEM. BY GIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN. THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS AND THIS IS NOT PERFECT WE KNOW THIS IS NOT PERFECT AND WE CAN WORK ON CAN MAY I SIT ON THE COMMITTEE TO TRY TO HELP IMPROVE IT. AND I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP MAKE IT BETTER. BUT FOR US TO ABANDON THE IDEA OF INCENTIVIZING GOOD WORK BY REGIONAL CENTERS MAKES NO SENSE AND I REALLY STRONGLY HOPE THEY THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. WE'LL SANFORD- COMMUNICANTS HOLDS AS FOLLOWS INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT OUTCOMES WE NEED OUT COMES AT THE STATE CAN LOOK AND SAY WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THERE'S OUTCOMES OF THE LANHAM ACT TALKS ABOUT FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL ALL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THEM WILL SERVE NEXT YEAR. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM IN THEIR LIFE THOSE TWO MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT OFTEN GOING TO BE THE SAME AND SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND THAT. REALLY APPLY THE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF FROM D. R. C. AND LA- AS IT IS THE LIMITED AT THE STATE LEVEL WE SHOULD MADE MAYBE MEASURE FIVE THINGS. IN MEASURE THEM READ THE READ THE WELL. ON THE OUTCOME LEVEL FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE CLEARLY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO IMPROVE STOP. VERY SMART EDS IMPORT IS RETIRED A NUMBER OF YEARS TOLD ME. YOU CAN NOT IN CENTS. A YEAR. AS MUCH AS LIKE. TO CHANGES THAT WAY NOT WHAT HAPPENS. YOU CAN REWARD THINGS YOU CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO SEE AT THE END THE DAY AFTER GO ON DO IT. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER IF SAID TO ME ALSO. POINT YOU DON'T. LOG BY WAYNE IT MORE OFTEN. SO INCREASING THIS YEAR NUMBER OF VOLUME OF MEASUREMENTS IS GOING IMPROVE IT. CA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING. TODAY THERE ARE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE IN COMPETITOR EMPLOYMENT. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THAT'S THE BASE IS A 50% INCREASE. IT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT. IT'S ALMOST HIDDEN DATA. WE'VE DONE THAT IT'S BEEN A GREAT PROGRAM IS A GREAT INCENTIVE. WE DON'T CELEBRATE THAT SO IF WE DON'T CELEBRATED MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT. PEOPLE NOT TO UNDERSTAND IT MAKES DE. AND USE IT. THE OTHER ONE IS A BUREAUCRACY WE ACTUALLY MORE PEOPLE EMPLOYED. BUT THE REQUIREMENT THE DATA REQUIREMENTS TO GET THE PAYMENT. FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN ITEMS OF PEOPLE HAVE CONTROL OVER. THEY CAN'T DO IT SO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE KEEP IT SIMPLE YOU WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT. THREE TO FIVE ITEMS. AS MANY MORE THAN THAT NO ONE WILL FOLLOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD EVENING ALMOST A VERY GOOD ANY CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T REALLY QUITE SEEN ENOUGH TO- SAY WHAT THIS PROGRAM ULTIMATELY YIELD IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES TO FORMED AN OPINION BUT I DID WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE- LA DOES WORK ON THIS AND SAYING THAT UNTIL WE PROVIDE A STRUCTURE. HAVE A HAVING MEASURING OUTCOMES IS GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC IN THE LONG RUN I THINK WE REPRESENT NINETY PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF YOU STARTED MEASURE THEM FOR OUTCOMES AND LOOK AT THAT PERFORMANCE WOULD DELIVER ON THOSE METRICS WE AND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO OUTCOMES MEASURES AND QUALITY METRICS BUT I DO SEE THAT WE- DO THAT WITHOUT. UNDER DEBATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT STAFF I'M AND PEOPLE NOT HAVING THEIR ACCESS CUT WILL YOU ONLY GET SERVICES ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE TAKE CARE PROVIDE SERVICES. THEY WERE REALLY GONNA MISS THE- I TELL AT. THANK YOU SIR. HI AND MY NAME IS LYNN WHERE I'M HERE WITH ARCS FRAN AND WITH SOME OF MY CLIENTS FROM THERE- WE ARE PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER AND I'M WITH THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS DEPARTMENT WHERE WE COORDINATE ALL THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF SOME OF OUR CLIENTS I HAVE A PRETTY LARGE CASELOAD THAT AND GROWING SINCE I STARTED- BASIC BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S KIND OF LIKE AT THE HUMAN LEVEL FROM FOR. AS WHERE FIELD FOR BECAUSE IF ERRORS WHAT I SEE IS THAT ALL OF US AE SEVERELY UNDERPAID. ARE STARTING WAGES EIGHTEEN FIFTY AN HOUR AND THAT'S FOR A VERY HIGH VOLUME- COMPLEX SOCIAL WORK JOB THAT'S VERY STRESSFUL- THE PEOPLE WHO STAY IN THE FIELD ARE THERE BECAUSE WE ARE. BASICALLY INTERNALLY SENT TO FIVE IS THAT IS WHAT I WOULD SAY WE- WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT OUR CLIENTS HEALTH AND WELL BEING. I COULD SAY THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE HAVE COME THROUGH MY PROGRAMS THAT. COULD POSSIBLY BE DEAD OR SEVERELY ILL IF WE WERE NOT SUPPORTING THEM. AND WE CARE- AND WHEN PEOPLE DO LEAVE THIS POSITION THEY LEAVE BECAUSE THAT WAGE IS NOT ENOUGH- TO PAY RENT. MOST PEOPLE HAVE SECOND AND THIRD JOBS JUST TO PAY RENT WHILE DOING THIS WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO- AND AT SOME POINT THEY BURN OUT. AND THEY'RE VERY SAD TO LEAVE THEIR CLIENTS. SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A REWARD TO. I WOULDN'T CALL IT A REWARD TO GIVE SOMEONE A LIVING WAGE. I THINK THAT WE FIND THE RIGHT WORDS. DOING VERY HUMAN WORK THAT IS SO NECESSARY. TO HAVE MORE MONEY TO LIVE AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DORGAN TURRETS GRANDMOTHER TO- DISABLED IN INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUAL. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY DO SUPPORT THAT REGIONAL CENTERS. BE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN GOALS BEFORE THEY GET MORE MONEY. I HAVE MY IDEA IS WHY DON'T YOU ASK FOR FAMILIES. IN THE TWENTY SIX YEARS THAT MY GRANDSON HAS BEEN. A CLIENT OF A REGIONAL CENTER I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE SOME KIND OF A QUESTIONNAIRE A SURVEY TO ASK ME HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED BY THE PARTICULAR OR LACK UP SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY MY PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTER. I THINK IT'S TIME I THINK IT'S TIME TO REALLY LOOK AT THEM WITH A MICROSCOPE FOR A- AND LOOK TO SEE I WORK WITH A LOT OF FAMILIES AS PART OF THE I CC ORGANIZATION. AND AS PART OF DISPARITIES I SEE A LOT OF OUR LATINO FAMILY IT'S NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED NUMBER ONE AND THE REGIONAL STAFF CENTER TAKING MUCH TOO LONG TO GET THE SERVICES IT PLACE. FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS DONNA FINE GOLD AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING CENTER ONE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO PERFORMANCE MEASURES I THINK MOST ORGANIZATIONS ARE MEASURING THEIR PERFORMANCE I KNOW WE DO. A SELF A SURVEY OF ALL THE PEOPLE WE SERVE THEIR FAMILIES STAFF EVERY TWO YEARS WE USE AN OUTSIDE AGENCY WE KNOW AND WE WANT OUR FOLKS TO BE- HAVE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS ALL REALLY LONG TIME. AND I COULD PROBABLY GOING TO ALMOST ANY ORGANIZATION AND TELL YOU WITH QUALITY SERVICE IS A BEING PROVIDED BY ASSESSING THE STAFF FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF VULNERABLE FOLKS AND THE QUALITY OF OUR STAFF. AND THE SKILLS OVERSTAFFED WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. SO BEFORE WE LOOK AT PERFORMANCE I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN TALK ABOUT THE LA- TALKED ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WAGES. WE ARE LOOKING AT A MINIMUM WAGE. MINIMUM WAGES FOR A PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE THAT DESERVE SO MUCH MORE. AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE LAST SPEAKER IT'S A COMPLEX JOB WORKING WITH COMPLEX PEOPLE. WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR WORKFORCE THEY DESERVE IT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE DESERVE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- WE WILL START WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON. FIRST OF ALL IT WAS A THANK YOU TO. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY I THINK WHAT- JUMPS OUT AT ME IS THERE'S- AND IT'S TO BE EXPECTED I MEAN WE HAVE A REGIONAL CENTERS IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE LEVEL OF SERVICES AND THINGS. ARE DIFFERENT- AS BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC SEN- SOCIO ECONOMICS OF THE AREA. BUT I'D SAY LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL AYE AYE AYE I'M PUZZLED I'M A DATE I'M A DATA PERSON BY BY NATURE- AN OPT IN- I THINK IS UNACCEPTABLE IF YOU WANT DATA YOU WANT DATA FROM EVERYONE. AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY. WANT PEOPLE TO OPT OUT- YOU WOULD MAKE ME WONDER OR MAYBE WONDER WHY PEOPLE WORK OPTING IN. BUT I'LL TELL YOU PROBABLY ONE REASON WHY SOME MIGHT MIGHT NOT OFTEN. IS YOU HEAR THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP HIGHER IN KEEP EMPLOYEES IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW YOU'RE GONNA HIRING KEEP THE PEOPLE. TO DO THE PROGRAMS HERE BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE WAGES ARE GOING TO BE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR WHAT THEIR SKILL LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE THERE AS WELL. THE OTHER THING THAT ALWAYS BUT IT BOTHERS ME AND IT'S A TREND WE'VE SEE WE'RE SEEN AS- THAT HERE THIS THE LINE THE PROGRAM WILL BE SUBJECT. TO POTENTIAL SUSPENSION ON JULY ONE TWELVE ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND WE SEE WERE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WEARE THE COMMITTED TO QUALITY AND IN FORT FOR THIS PROGRAM OR WE'RE NOT. AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE DOING TO DO THIS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AND SEE HOW IT GOES- BOTHERS ME BECAUSE- I THINK QUALITY- IS IT IS AN ONGOING AN ON GOING PROCESS AND IT JUST. IT BOTHERS ME SO HOW YOU HIRE PEOPLE TO SAY YOU KNOW YEAH WE WANT YOU FOR THIS JOB YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS BUT YET YOU YOU MAY NOT HAVE A JOB IN A YEAR OR TWO OR YOU DO YOU JUST NOT TELL. AND THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE DISHONEST AND SO. SO I APPRECIATE WHERE THAT THE LA IT WAS COMING FROM- I THINK OFTEN IS UNACCEPTABLE AND- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE REALLY BE LOOKING AT. FOR A CALL LONG TERM COMMITMENT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THE GOAL HERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. UP OUR FIRST OF ALL THANK. THE RQ NOTICEABLE PALSY A COMMUNITY VOCATIONAL SERVICES A LOT OF FOLKS FROM OUR FROM OUR AREA- I HAD PRIVILEGES SERVING AS A MAYOR FRESNO FOR EIGHT YEARS AND HAD A GREAT DEAL OF PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT WITH THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THAT CARE FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND BROUGHT ATTENTION PURPOSES THE JOY OF THAT JOB WAS TO SEE OF THESE PEOPLE FLOURISH AND TO DO GOOD THINGS- NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT. ACCOUNTABILITY WE ALL WANT ACCOUNTABILITY. ACCOUNTABILITY IS FUNDAMENTAL IN FACT I THINK THE REGIONAL CENTERS ONE ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THAT DOES IT- THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES- EXPECT THE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY BIG BASIC CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM LITERALLY FALLING APART IN FRONT OF OUR VERY OWN. PACE WE ARE EXPECTING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO GET QUALITY MEASURABLE CARE. AND YET WE'RE DOING IT FOR MINIMUM WAGE. WE EXPECT THESE ASSOCIATIONS IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO. AND YET THEIR RATES. ARE POVERTY RATES. THIS IS THE REAL PLACE THAT WE FIND. OF SO MANY WHO RECEIVE THESE SERVICES. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING FOR FAMILIES- TO ACCESS A SYSTEM. IN WHICH- WHAT WE DON'T ADEQUATE. NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT COMPENSATING THESE PROFESSIONALS. THERE'S A TURNOVER RATE. MY CONCERN IS WE GET THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. AT THE FIRST THING WE HAVE GOT TO DO. IS SETTLE OUT ON THIS ONE POINT EIGHT. BILLION DOLLAR. PROBLEM WE SPENT. WHAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO DO A RATES THAT. AND AS BEST I CAN TELL. STATE ACCOUNT IS IGNORING THAT RATE STUDY. UP AND I REALLY THINK THAT BEFORE UP. OUT WE CAN GET ACT ATTIC QUICK MEASUREMENT. FROM A SYSTEM UNDER HUGE STRESS IS TO HELP THEM RELIEVE THAT STRESS TO BE ABLE TO HIGHER UP IN AFFORD QUALITY PEOPLE THAT WILL STAY THE COURSE WITH THEM. ANDGIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY CAN REALLY DO. IF WE ARE COMMITTING TO THEM THE KIND OF RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THEM TO DO IT SO LET'S FIRST. GET THE SYSTEM STABILIZE LET'S GET PEOPLE EMPLOYED WITH PAYCHECKS THEY CAN LIVE ON LET'S GIVE THESE- ORGANIZATIONS THE OPERATIONAL MONEY SO THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING A DECISION. ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP THIS PARTICULAR UP A PERSON HANDLE BUREAUCRACY- BECAUSE OF A GRANT. OR FIND SOMEBODY THAT CAN DO ACCOUNTING- FIRST THINGS FIRST THE SERVICES TO THESE DEAR PEOPLE I THINK IS UNDER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS. IN DO LARGE PART BECAUSE WE'RE SIMPLY EXPECTING IT TO PERFORM AT. FIFTY DOLLARS ON A HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR AND WE'RE GIVING A FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY FOLKS AND WE'D BETTER FIX THIS FIRST OR THE QUALITY. IS GOING TO BE CONTINUING. UNFORTUNATE TO DECLINE BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING THE BEST PEOPLE AND WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME REPLACING THEM AND FINDING FOR THE SYSTEM IF WE CARE ABOUT THE FAMILIES IN THESE. A PEOPLE IN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT FOR GOODNESS SAKES COMPENSATE THEM ENOUGH AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE NECESSARY THAT RATES AND AT AND PAYMENTS SO THAT CAN DO IT WITH A EVERYTHING. THE MAN OF AND THAT THEY DO. THANK. IF I COULD I WANTED TO QUOTE THE TOP OF PAGE TWENTY TWO WHERE THE ELLIE- STATES. THAT THEY FIND THAT THE SYSTEM'S CURRENT CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY THE FUNDING CHALLENGES WOULD SIGNIFICANT CAN ONLY YOU CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO RESPOND TO INCENTIVES IN A WAY THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE INTENDED GOALS. FURTHER ON IT SAYS THE LA- NOTES THAT THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS TO MOVE THE SYSTEM AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTING RATE REFORM. AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AGAIN. HELP US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WILL MOVE US TOWARDS. OR AWAY FROM RATE REFORM. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE- PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THE COMMITTEE'S COMMENTS BECAUSE THESE ARE. IT THAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF CLARIFY SOMETHING ON THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IS THAT THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IS IDENTIFY. FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE REASON REGIONAL CENTER AND IT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER TO WORK ON HOW DO THEY DELIVER SERVICES AS A SERVICE COORDINATION EIGHT- ORGANIZATION. SO LET ME JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY AND IT'S NOT MINIMIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSATION. ON SYSTEM. OUR PATH FORWARD WITH RATES YOU KNOW I'M NOT MINIMIZING THAT SO. AT CONVERSATION IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CORE TENET OF WHAT THE LATTER MANAK IS AND WHAT KIND OF THE CORE SERVICE THAT THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS DO. AND WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS- KIND OF OBLIGATION AS- AS A SYSTEM AND THAT IS REALLY HELPING FAMILIES- CONNECT TO SERVICES SOME OF THOSE SERVICES ARE FUNDED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER. SOME OF THOSE SERVICE CSUS ARE NOT A KIND OF HAD A TALK ABOUT EARLIER. THE IT PARTICULARLY FOR THE THAT ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO WE REALLY HAVE SEEN CHANGES INTO HAVING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOP THE DISABILITY. BUT THEY MAY ALSO THEN BE RECEIVING OBVIOUSLY EDUCATION SERVICES YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE RECEIVING AS IT AS IT HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT ABA FOR AUTISM OR NEEDING SERVICES IN OTHER AREAS. SOME OF THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT FUNDED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER BUT THERE REALLY IMPORTANT OF THE FAMILIES WE HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF FAMILIESAND OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT HAS BEEN SO PASSIONATE. IS HOW FAMILIES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF ACCESSING SERVICES WITHIN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND SO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS THERE'S AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE AND ITS FOCUSES ON THAT SYSTEM KIND OF COORDINATION FOR CHILDREN HER IN FOSTER CARE AND SO PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW I'M PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THOSE THAT ARE IN FOSTER CARE IN OUR SYSTEM. AND HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HELP THAT CARE COORDINATION SIDE WE CAN IDENTIFY A VERY SPECIFIC GOAL IN PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT IS TIED TO THE SERVICE COORDINATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE. ALL THE RELIANCE ON SAY COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT OR SOME OTHER AREAS WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE THINGS IN WHICH THE SERVICE COORDINATORS AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE CONTROL OF THAT THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO AFFECT CHANGE AND SO IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO AFFECT CHANGE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEASURE THAT CHANGE. THEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE INCENTIVES TIED TO THAT CHANGE SO THAT'S WHERE I YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT WITHOUT FURTHER MORE DETAIL IT'S HARD TO KINDA CONCEPTUAL I IS AN AND WE CAN PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL CLARITY- WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT- OVER THE THAT THAT SHORT WHILE HERE BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET FURTHER COMMENTS BACK ON FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS SO I TRULY UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF THE STRUGGLE IS HERE. IN KIND UNDERSTANDING THIS PART AND I ACTUALLY AND I ALSO REALLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA INTEGRITY WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES TO MEASURE THAT ACROSS THE STATE BETWEEN EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. INCREASING THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS WE KNOW THAT IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT TRAINING WITHIN THE CEDAR WHICH IS OUR ONE OF THE CLIENT- SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN CAN MONITOR THAT WE CAN AFFECT CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT AS WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL SO WE CAN. REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WORKS FOR ON THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE AND TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND IT IS TRANSPARENT TO EVERYBODY. WELL I HOPE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON AND SORRY TO USE THE HEALTH ANALOGY BUT- SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SOME HEMORRHAGING WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND- IS THIS. PROVIDING PRESSURE VERSES ACTUALLY SOLVING WHAT IS UNDERLYING AND I WOULD JUST- HAVE SOME URGENCY AS WE HAVE THOSE. CONVERSATION YES THANK YOU AND I DO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE THANK YOU- IF I COULD I DID WANT TO ALSO A CO- DOCTOR WOULD AS WELL AS DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND DISABILITY VOICES UNITED- IS THE ADMINISTRATION AMENABLE. TO A MANDATORY PARTICIPATION BY THE REGIONAL EARNERS. I'M A HE PERFORMED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN DOING KNOW. ARCA IS A MAN OF O THIS AS WELL. AS I'M AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CON. WITH OPEN TO A PUT WHAT MAKES THE PER MORE WE ARE VERY. OF LOOKING STATE MEASURE SAID EACH RIDGE CENTER IS. MEASURE TO SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE CAN LOOK AT NOT ONLY HOW EACH REGIONAL CENTERS FUNCTIONING THAT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE REST OF THE STATE. SO OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO IF I CAN JUST BECAUSE OUR NEXT HEARING IS AGAIN ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND FOR THIS I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR STAFF TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO REVISE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CREATE FURTHER SPECIFICITY ON HOW THIS PROGRAM WOULD WORK. AND THE GOALS IT WOULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE TOWARDS CREATING A VIABLE OPTION. IF THIS PROPOSAL IS ULTIMATELY ADOPTED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I'M I'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN RACIAL. ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN SYSTEM PERFORMANCE TO BE A CENTRAL GOAL. FOR THIS PROPOSAL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. AND BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THIS ISSUE I MAY WANT TO ASK OUR CODE IF THEY'RE AMENABLE TO THE MANDATORY PARTICIPATION AS WELL. YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND I THINK WHERE WE WOULD LAND ON THIS IS REALLY JUST NEEDING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS WERE WILL BE- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS I HAD OF APRIL TWENTY SECOND TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THOSE GOALS WOULD BE AND THAT WOULD GIVE US. THE FRAMEWORK WITH WITHIN WHICH TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION PERFECT WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. OKAY THANK YOU- FINE ISSUE FOR- THE AGENDA- CORRECTLY NOTES THE PROPOSAL- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT INCLUDES- SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TOLD OF FUN IN LEVIN POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND TO REDUCE- REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE- COORDINATOR RATIOS- FOR. INDIVIDUALS AGES THREE. FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD. AND IN IN AGAIN TALKING TO FAMILIES AND TALKING TO- THOSE THAT ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE. THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT THAT REALLY DROVE TO OF FOCUS- ON THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUP. IS THAT THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY FAMILIES ARE HAVING TO NAVIGATE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AS I HAVE TALKED ABOUT ENTERING INTO THE EDUCATION. GOING TO E. IS. YEAH BUT WE'RE ALSO FINDING NEW WHEN WE TALKED TO- FAMILY. THAT ARE REALLY IDENTIFIED HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS. MANY TIMES IT IS OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AGE GROUP OF THIS BAND. THAT THIS IS A PARTICULAR AGE GROUP THERE'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THIS IS AN AGE GROUP THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. INDIVIDUALS% THAT ARE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE MULTIPLE AREAS IN WHICH ARE IMPACTING FAMILIES AND REALLY HAVING TO SAY. HOW DO WE TAKE A LOOK AT. YOU KNOW NAVIGATING AND RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF HAVING. SERVICE COORDINATORS WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO- BE SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES. THAT THE FAMILIES ARE FACING DURING THIS THIS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL. TIME IT IS. PRETTY EVIDENT WE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HELPING A FAMILY- IN THESE EARLY AGES THAT HELPS THEM. BUILD THEIR SKILL SET EVEN THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN OF THEIR CHILD AS THEY NAVIGATE THEN I'M GOING FORWARD SO THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME AND THUS WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR. FOR PUTTING THIS IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SURE THANK YOU I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR ENHANCE CASE THE RATIOS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN REFLECTS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN SERVICE COORDINATORS AND EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN SUPERVISING COUNSELORS TO SUPERVISE THE ADDITIONAL- SERVICE COORDINATORS IN ADDITION TO BUILDING ON THE LAST ISSUE WITH THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM ALSO HAS A TENANT ON SERVICE COORDINATION SO THIS ALSO WELL THIS IS MORE FOCUSED ON THIS SPECIFIC AGE GROUP THERE ARE OTHER EFFORTS BEING MADE LOOKING AT SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS THANK YOU. THANK YOU HELLO. SENATE PETTITTE LA. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS OF THIS PROPOSAL WERE WITHHOLDING RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE WE DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ANALYTIC BASIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTED THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE CASELOAD RATIOS IN THE EARLY START PROGRAM FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS UNDER AGE THREE- HOWEVER THOSE RATIOS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AT ONE TO FORTY FIVE THEIR MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. A IN FACT THEY'RE THEY'RE CLOSER TO THEIR OVER SIXTY- INFANTS AND TODDLERS- PER SERVICE COORDINATOR IN ADDITION MANY OTHERS CASELOAD RATIOS ARE FOR OTHER AGE GROUPS AND OTHER TYPES OF CONSUMERS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW AND WITH FEDERAL AGREEMENTS. MORE THAN 90% OF CONSUMERS ARE CURRENTLY SERVED AT REGIONAL CENTERS WITH CASELOADS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS COULD PUT OUR FEDERAL MEDICAID WAIVER FUNDING AT RISK. I'M NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH EARLY CHILDHOOD IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT AGENT IMPORTANT MILESTONE IN A CONSUMER'S LIFE IT'S NOT CLEAR. A SPECIFICALLY WHY AGES THREE FOUR AND FIVE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED OVER- INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN EARLY START- OR OVER OTHER KEY AGE GROUPS SUCH AS THE TRANSITION AGE GROUP- FROM WHEN A CHILD IS BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWO AND IT'S SORT OF TRANSITIONING FROM. THE SCHOOLS TO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM- AND- WE WOULD ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THIS IS THE MOST URGENT NEED ACROSS EVERY SINGLE REGIONAL CENTER THERE MAY BE- SPECIFIC NEEDS AT AT DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS. I'M FINALLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT EACH YEAR THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CASELOAD RATIOS TO THE DEPARTMENT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THIS- THE REPORTS ARE DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT IN MARCH. SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE- MEMBERS REQUEST THAT UPDATED INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU. SEEN THEM WE HAVE WAR THERE SOME LIMóN MAIENSCHEIN IS NOT JOINING US BUT WANTED TO RECOGNIZE TIFFANY WHEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF TIFFANY OR WITH THAT THE ARE YOU CAL WE HAVE OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN PARTICULAR OUR DIRECT SUPPORT AND REGIONAL CENTER WORKERS AT TEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND VARIOUS PROVIDER AGENCIES. TODAY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST SUPPORT ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN PROPOSAL ALONG WITH ARCA- AND SCA CALIFORNIA TO FIND EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED PERSON CENTERED PLANNING THAT THE CLIENTS OF REGIONAL CENTERS NEED AND DESERVE. CURRENTLY WE HAVE MEMBERS- OF REGIONAL CENTERS WE CASELOADS UPWARDS OF NINETY- CASES AND SOME OF THEM REACHING AND THE HIGH HUNDREDS. OF LEAVING THEM UNABLE TO GIVE TIME AND ATTENTION TO EACH FAMILY AND STEP THERE OFTENTIMES LEFT TO TRIAGE AND DO CRISIS MANAGEMENT WE LIKE TO THINK THE LA- FOR INCLUDING IN THE ANALYSIS THE CHART. IN THE CHART YOU WILL SEE THAT THE TOP TWO- REGIONAL CENTER SAN ANDREAS AND NORTHERN LA COUNTY REGIONAL CENTERS BOTH OF WHICH WE REPRESENT SERVICE COORDINATOR THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE RATIO OF ONE TO EIGHTY TWO- THESE HIGH CASELOADS ARE CAUSES ARE CAUSING DELAYS AND SERVICES. MISTAKES ARE BEING MADE AND AT TIMES PEOPLE ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE RECOGNIZES THE DIRE NEED TO HIRE MORE SERVICE COORDINATORS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AS THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE THAT CONTINUE TO SUFFER. NOT ME TO THE CURRENT STATE. REQUIRED VOTE RATIO PUTS STATE AT RISK OF LOSING FEDERAL FUNDING BECAUSE THE STATE MADE A PROMISE TO MEET THE RATIOS. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT PROMISE WAS NOT MET IN THE STATE LOST NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AFTER PROMISING AGAIN TO MEET THE RATIOS THEY ARE STILL ON MET AND TWENTY TWENTY. THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO POTENTIALLY A LINE IN THIS CASE WHAT RATIO AS WE HEARD EARLIER POTENTIALLY WITH THE PROPOSED- INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND WE WOULD HIGHLY URGE AGAINST THIS. AS IT WOULD ONLY EXACERBATE THE CURRENT PROBLEM AND CREATE INSTABILITY AND FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS. WHAT WE SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S GOAL OF VALUE IN CONSUMER OUTCOMES IN CREATING A QUALITY SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE WOULD REMAIN THAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE CURRENT WORK FORCE AND ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS- DIRECTOR BARGE MEN MENTIONED. BEING ABLE TO SERVICE COORDINATORS BEING ABLE TO AFFECT CHANGE I WOULD ARGUE THAT YES THEY ARE ABLE TO AFFECT CHANGE. IF THEY HAVE REASONABLE CASELOAD THAT RESPECT THAT REFLECT THE CURRENT STATUTE- AND OUR PROMISE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN CONCLUSION- WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO AGAIN- SAY THAT THIS MEASURE THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTED BY THE LETTERMAN COALITION AND IS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL LETTERMAN COALITION ASK. AND THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN HOLDEN AND FRAZIER- FOR THEIR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HAVE- PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER JORDAN LINDSAY ON BEHALF OF THE LIMóN COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE S. YEAH YOU AN ARC A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE HIS MENTOR BRING ME INTO COMPLIANCE I'M WITH FEDERAL GUIDELINES- EARLY TODAY I MENTIONED ABOUT A MOTHER WHO JUST WAS ON THE PHONE WITH EARLIER IN HER EIGHT YEAR OLD SON WHO WERE JUST SAID TWO DAYS AGO EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. REGIONAL SON WITH AUTISM THEY WERE TRYING SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING THE DAVE COMING EXPERTS IN HOLMES SO SHE WAS TRYING TO SET SOMETHING UP FOR HER SON IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SHE SAID SHE'S GONE THROUGH THREE SERVICE COORDINATORS AT THE REGIONAL CENTER BEEN STARTING ALL OVER EACH TIME AND NOW THAT THERE HOMELESS THERE IS NOTHING. FOR HER SON RIGHT NOW THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING THE TURN OVER IN- SERVICE CORNERS OFFICIALS CENTERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HI ERIC SIGNIN AGAIN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER- SPEAKING IN. SUPPORT OF THE ARC SEIU PROPOSAL FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS SO AS DIRECTOR MARTIN POINTED OUT IN THE FIRST PANEL THE SERVICE COORDINATION REALLY IS A CORE FUNCTION A CORE PART OF THE LANHAM ACT. AND IT'S WHEN IT WORKS WELL IT'S REALLY BREATHTAKING IN ITS IMPACT IN TERMS OF CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH SERVICES IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THEIR NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS AND HELPING THEM. REALIZE THOSE WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN SERVICE CORNERS AREN'T ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE WHEN THEIR CASELOADS ARE THIS HIGH- IT IS HEARTBREAKING AND FRUSTRATING DEEPLY TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES- EVEN WHEN THEY CAN RESPOND IF THERE AREN'T THE SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO OF AND- YOU KNOW CONNECT THE PERSON WITH IT IS EQUALLY HEART BREAKING AND FRUSTRATING. SO GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER WELL- WE ARE AT TWO HUNDRED AND THE COST OF LIVING SO WE ARE REALLY THE CANARY IN THE MINE IN THIS THE NEXT REGIONAL CENTER NEXT HIGHEST. COST OF LIVING REGIONAL CENTER IS SAN ANDREAS A HUNDRED AND 70% OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE COST OF LIVING HOW THAT TRANSLATES TO US AND SERVICE COORDINATION IS THAT WE RECEIVED AN ALLOCATION TO THE POOR STAFFING FORMULA OF RACIAL WORKER SERVICE HERE MAKES WHICH MEANS WE HAVE A- SERVICE COORDINATORS. WHICH PROCESS ON NUMBER THREE ON SONYA'S LIST OF HIGH CASELOADS AT AND EIGHTY PER PERSON. WHAT'S HARD TO PORTRAY IN A IN A HEARING OR AN OFFICE BUILDING IS THE IMPACT THAT THE WORKERS THE SOCIAL THE SURF CORNERS THEMSELVES HAVEN'T. WE TO CONVERT ON OF MONTHS AGO LEGISLATIVE STAFF AROUND THIS AND BILINGUAL SOCIAL WORKERS A BILINGUAL BICULTURAL SOCIAL WORKERS A WELDING GATEWAY VERY COMPELLING IN THE WAY THEY TALKED ABOUT. HOW OUR DAILY LIVES. ACTED BY HAVING EIGHTY FIVE OR NINETY FIVE CASES AND THE WAY THAT HAPPENS IS THEY'RE DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF CRISES AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT THEY HAVE FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP WITH AND SLIP IN I. P. IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY HAVE ALL THESE CAN. PRESS WHICH- THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE- INTENSE NEEDS FIRST. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE. RECOGNIZE THAT THERE CAN PEOPLE A SERVER. BEFORE THEY GET IN THAT CRISIS STATE SO IT IS JUST. I FEEL LIKE IT THE GOAL GATE IS OUT THE- THE MOST INTENSELY- IMPACTED BY THIS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN BEING ABLE TO. RETAIN OUR AVERAGE SOCIAL WORKER MAKES. AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND BUT PROBABLY. DOLLARS AT THE CAN MAKE WHEN THEY WORK FOR THE COUNT IS AN AND WE LOSE PEOPLE TO- OTHER SYSTEMS IN THAT WAY. AND SO I URGE SUPPORT OF THAT. THANK YOU SIR. HI KATIE HERBERGER DISABILITY RIGHTS BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE WAS SO SOFT SPOKEN EXCEPT ME. UP BUT THAT COULD GO WITH MY- POINT THAT I'M A FORMER EARLY INTERVENTION TEACHER SO THE LITTLE ONES ARE CLOSE TO MY HEART AND SO I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW OLD THEY WERE PICKED AS SORT OF THE GROUP TO PRIORITIZE IN REDUCING CASELOADS OF BECAUSE THAT IS A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TIME THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT OTHER TIMES OF LIFE FOR NOT CHALLENGING. BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THAT AGE GROUP. IN REGARDS TO THE EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS- I THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE A SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORTAGE WE DEFINITELY HAVE CASELOADS THAT ARE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH AND I WILL TELL YOU MY ADVOCATES. OFTEN COMPLAIN TO ME ABOUT THEIR INABILITY TO WORK WITH SERVICE COORDINATORS BECAUSE OF UNCOVERED CASELOADS AND OTHER PROBLEMS HOWEVER I THINK THAT THERE MAY BE MORE OF A DISCUSSION TO BE HAD RATHER THAN JUST HIRING EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE A ONE TIME ON EXPENDITURES RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD MAKE SERVICE COORDINATORS MORE EFFICIENT IT COULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER PRIORITIZE CASELOADS SUCH AS BILINGUAL CASELOADS. ON SO THEM I THINK THAT IS WE NEED A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SERVICE COORDINATOR WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE H. CBS RULES AND SEE IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF SERVICE COORDINATOR THAT MAY BE RESEARCHED. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR A LARGER DISCUSSION INSTEAD OF JUST EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE METERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. REVENUE AT GETTING BURIED IN QUE. JUST SERVICE ASSOCIATION JUST OF BOYS HARSH. FOR THE ARE AND AS YOU FOR TO. FILL THE EIGHT HUNDRED FOR THE CASEMENT OKAY. OUR SYSTEM WORKS BEST WHEN WE'RE OFF. ON SIR THE PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL WITHIN LESS DEVELOP DISABILITIES AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS NEED. THE ADEQUATE NUMBERS TO GET THEM INTO THE SERVICES THAT THESE PEOPLE NEED- SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER SERVICES TO THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING AMY WESLEY ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES- APPRECIATE YOU HEARING THIS ISSUE THIS EVENING. WANT TO THANK. THE ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY NANCY FOR SPEAKING SO MUCH ABOUT THE VALUE OF SERVICE COORDINATION. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A CHILD WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY THERE ARE SO MANY. PROFESSIONALS THAT ENTER THEIR LIVES AND THEY NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT THEY REALLY NEED HELP WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THOSE SYSTEMS AYE MINIMUM THE OTHER NIGHT WHO SAID. MY DAUGHTER'S HEALTH IS FINALLY STABLE SHOWING HAS FIVE DOCTORS BUT SHE SEES NW. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WEARING THAT WITH AYE HSS MEDIC HOW. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM CAO FRESH HEARD ALL THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING WITH AND THAT'S REALLY THE VALUE OF SERVICE COORDINATION BUT HAD HIGH CASELOADS CHALLENGE THIS WORK AND MAKE THE WORK OFTENTIMES LESS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND TRUST ABOUT CHECKING BOXES AND GETTING WORK DONE- AND REALLY THE VALUE IS IN. THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE TO THE CASELOAD RATIOS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO I WENT BACK ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE AND LOOKED AT WHAT WERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WE WERE SUPPORTING AT THAT TIME- PARTICULARLY AROUND THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE. PEOPLE REQUIRE A GREATER DEGREE OF SERVICE COORDINATION AT THAT TIME WE HAD AN AUTISM RATE OF HAD 7% OF THE INDIVIDUALS BEING SUPPORTED WITH SEVERE BEHAVIOR IS NOW IT'S TWENTY. OUR ELDERLY POPULATION SIXTY TWO AND OVER WAS LESS THAN 3% NOW IT'S APPROACHING FIVE AND THE PEOPLE LIVING IN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WERE OVER 2% TWENTY YEARS AGO AND NOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE BEING SUPPORTED IN THE COMMUNITY THERE'S LESS THAN POINT 1% LEFT IN. DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. REGIONAL CENTER SPEND MORE IN SERVICE COORDINATION THAN THEY WERE FUNDED WHAT FOR. AND WE STILL HAVE THE SHORTFALL. IN TERMS OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF OR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO THAT ENHANCE SERVICE COORDINATION FOR THREE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF SERVICE COORDINATION FOR ALL YOUNG CHILDREN- BUT AS THE LA- NOTES IN ITS REPORT THE- REDUCED RATIOS FOR EARLY START YOU AREN'T EVEN POSSIBLE TODAY. WE ALSO DO WANT TO NOTE THAT- IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS PROPOSAL OF BEING BORED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IT'S ESSENTIALLY BUILDING A GOOD DIFFERENTIAL ON TOP OF A BAD BASS AND SO THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS UNDER FUNDED BY BY OUR CALCULATIONS ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. JUDY MARK PARENT AND DISABILITY VOICES UNITED MY SIGN IN HIS TWENTY THREE YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS HAD AMAZING SERVICE COORDINATORS AND HE'S HAD VERY MEDIOCRE SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND THEY'RE ALL THE SAME RATIO. IT TO ME IT'S THERE ARE SOME REALLY TERRIFIC PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM. AND THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO WANT TO CLOCK IN AND CLOCK OUT AND I THINK THAT. TO ONCE AGAIN I KNOW I FEEL LIKE I'M A BROKEN RECORD ON THIS FOR ONCE AGAIN ONCE AGAIN TO ADD MORE MONEY TO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT ASKING FOR ANYTHING IN RETURN. SEEMS TO MAKE NO SENSE. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME STANDARDS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT IF WE WANT TO. LOWER CASE THREE SHOWS THAT THERE HAS TO BE EXPECTATIONS MADE OF SERVICE COORDINATORS I HEAR THE STORIES PARTICULARLY FROM PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS WHO DO CORN MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE INTIMIDATED BY THE SYSTEM AND BY THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS. SO WE HAVE TO HAVE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE WE HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND BY JUST SAYING POINT BLANK YES LET'S THROWING MORE MONEY AT THIS WITHOUT A CLEAR EXPECTATION MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. IT IS EVENING AS AN ACTOR MY NAME IS MARK CLAUS I AM THE PRESIDENCY- FROM OF GUIDING HANDS IN SAN DIEGO WE SUPPORT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS. WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I'M HERE TO SPEAK. IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL- HIRING THE ADDITIONAL- SERVICE COORDINATORS- THIS IS MY FORTY IF YOU'RE WORKING IN THE SYSTEM- A COUPLE YEARS AGO MY GRANDSON WAS. MOVED IN WITH US AT TWO. I'M THE EXPERT I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM- HE HAD THREE SERVICE COORDINATORS- IN A YEAR AND A HALF- THEY WERE LEAVING FOR MORE MONEY- MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY ACTIVE. IN THIS SYSTEM- AND- WE STRUGGLED TRYING TO FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM- WITHOUT GOOD SERVICE COORDINATORS GOOD ADEQUATE SERVICE COORDINATORS AND THE RIGHT NUMBER SERVICE COORDINATORS. WHEN I CAN SEE GOOD BUT GOOD VALUE WERE GOOD OUTCOME SO I WANT TO OFFER MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IF I MAY AND- THE LA- HAD. BROUGHT UP THAT THERE IS A RISK OF. FEDERAL FUNDING OF BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CASELOAD RATIO STANDARDS AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. YES THANK YOU- I'M I'LL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDED OF RESPONSE AND THEN I HAVE MY TECHNICAL EXPERT WHO JUST JOIN ME HERE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR- BUT AS I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME SHIFT AS FAR AS HOW CMS EVALUATES AND MEASURES COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL WAIVER. AND THERE WAS A TIME WHEN AND CERTAINLY IT THE MISS WOULDN'T HAD OUTLINED THE TIME WHEN WE HAD A FINDING AND THAT THE PLAN OF CORRECTION AND THE RESPONSE THAT ULTIMATELY LED INTO STATUTE IS TO KEESLER RATIOS. BUT RIGHT NOW- CMS IS USING DATA THAT AS I SAID THERE'S A CHANGE THAT'S OCCURRING NATIONALLY AND CMS IS ALSO MAKING THAT SHIFT AS WELL. AND SO THE MEASURE THEY USE PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH H. CBS WAIVER ONE OF THE MEASURES IS NOT RATIOS- HOWEVER THEY DO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT OF THOSE OUTCOMES AND SO THERE'S- JUST A KIND OF LINK THE TWO PROPOSALS TOGETHER BETWEEN. THE CASELOAD RATIO HERE BUT THEN ALSO THE QUESTION IS TO COMPLIANCE SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE AND SAID TO PROGRAM IN BEING ABLE TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WITHIN STATUTE TO HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE STAFFING MODEL THAT COULD BE PRESENTED. BY STILL HAVING REGIONAL CENTERS USE SO STRATEGIES THAT THEY IDENTIFIED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS. BUT SHE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT GETS TO THOSE OUTCOMES ACTUALLY IS A TIED TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE H. CBS FEDERAL FUNDING- SO IT AND ALL IF MISTER KNIGHT HAS ANY ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ELEMENTS OF IT THAT MIGHT BE HELP. MANY YES THANK YOU JIM WITH THAT. OF THE SERVICES SO JUST TO ADD A BIT MORE. UNDER OF THE PER MEASURES THAT CMS REQUIRES NOW HE REALLY IS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN SAID LOOKING AT SOME OF THE RESULTS IF YOU WILL OF CASE MANAGEMENT AS OPPOSED TO- A RATIO SO FOR INSTANCE- CASE MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED IN IN IN TO DO A TINY REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS MAKING SURE THEY'RE UPDATED WHEN. NEEDS CHANGE AND THE LIKE AND ALSO IF THEY REFLECT- INDIVIDUALS HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS SO IT'S THOSE KIND OF MEASURES NOW THAT CMS LOOKS TO AND THAT WE REPORT ON. EVERY FIVE YEARS TO AND TO SEE A MASS. AND IN THAT THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHAT'S USED IN TO EVALUATE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE WAIVER. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THOSE ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO WORKLOAD. THE PERFORMANCE OF. THE THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE TIMELY REVIEWS. THIS THIS IS NANCY SO WITH THERE'S ALWAYS TIES TO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES YOU KNOW AND YOU TO BE ABLE TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT ARE THOSE OUTCOMES AND- CLEARLY WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE'RE IDENTIFYING A NEED. THAT HAS TO DEVELOP A READINESS TO ACHIEVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND SO THE FIRST YEAR OF BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THERE IS A COMMENT THAT ALSO TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS ITS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO REPLACE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE KIND OF THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. AND WITH THE REDUCE THAT THE CASE LOW FOR THE THREE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLDS WITH THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHERE REGIONAL CENTERS. COULD IDENTIFY THAT THEIR PRIORITY OR THE WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THEY'RE- THEY'RE NOT ACHIEVING THEM TODAY MAYBE TO HIRE EX NUMBER SERVICE COORDINATORS OR IT MAY BE EX NUMBER SERVICE COORDINATORS PLUS EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST PUSHED. PLUS THE HEALTH PLANS SPECIALISTS PLUS SO THEY THEY CAN REALLY USE. THE FLEXIBILITY AND TO NAVIGATING IT AS OPPOSED TO A PRESCRIPTIVE. BECAUSE A PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH MAY NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR EVERY COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS THAT RUBRIC REPRESENT. A MULTIPLE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. I THINK MY CONCERN IF I CAN JUST VOICE OUT LOUD IS- THE RISK REALLY HERE TO FEDERAL FUNDING AND SO I JUST HIM. BRINGING IT UP AS A WAY FOR ME TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN AND- YOU KNOW IF WE WERE TO DO THE THREE FOURS AND FIVES THAT YOU SPEAK OF. I THINK MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT'S OUR PLAN TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING CASELOAD RATIOS THAT WOULD BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- OUTLINES A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND TYING THAT BACK TO- WHAT WE'RE MEASURING AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TO WHAT IS- REPORTABLE TO EIGHT CBS WHICH IS THE FEDERAL DOLLARS. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL DOLLARS IT'S IMPORTANT ELEMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT. AND USING THE ABILITY TO- IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE IN LINE MEANT WITH WHAT THE EXPECTATION OF OUR PERFORMANCE THAT WE HAVE TO. DELIVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ARE IS THAT LANDS THAT WE WOULD BE USING AND THE PERFORMANCE AND SAID TO PROGRAM- IF I MAY AND- IT'S THE FINAL THING WILL HAVE FOR THIS- IS TO ASK FOR SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF I MAY REGARDING THE- ADVOCATES PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIN SHINES PROPOSAL- I'D LIKE TO. GET SOME RENDON CONVERT CONFIRMATION IF I CAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT- REGARDING THE ADVOCATES ESTIMATE OF FIFTY POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR RECTIFYING THE CASELOAD RATIOS. IF I CAN AS WELL AS ASKING FOR UPDATED RATIO INFORMATION- THAT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT RATIOS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL- IF WE COULD PROVIDE THAT BY MARCH FOURTEENTH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TOO EARLY BUT- I KNOW WERE. PUSHING UP AND ARE TRYING HARD TO GET INFORMATION SO WITH THAT WE WILL OKAY WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF COURSE FIXED AND IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT NO ONE I'M QUITE SENSITIVE TO THE FRONTLINE WORKERS AND THE STORIES OF NAVIGATION AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY HAVE FROM. BEING RUNNING TOO FAST ON A TREADMILL AND SO- JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT AN ACCURATE. ANALYSIS WOULD BE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION ONE THING I WOULD KNOW MISTER CHAIR IS THAT IF USING THE BASELINE OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN SURVEY IS THAT THE NEW SURVEY WITH THE UPDATED CASELOAD RATIOS IS ALSO COMING OUT IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WILL REFLECT. UPDATED RATIOS THAT WAS PROVIDED AS AN INVESTMENT THIS BUDGET ACT FOR THE SPECIALIZED CASELOAD- SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL NEEDS WE REDUCE CASELOAD FOR ONE TO TWENTY FIVE AND THIS BUDGET AXES COULD BE SOME CHANGES IN THE DATA SO WALL DEPENDING ON THE TIMING WHEN THAT COMES OUT MAY OR MAY NOT. HAVE THAT TO OUR DISPOSAL AS WELL ROOM THREE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN AND MOVE ON THIS. TWO FIVE. THANK YOU SO AS THE AGENDA- CORRECTLY NOTES- THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT FORWARD THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT WITH OUR SAFETY NET- AS A REMINDER THAT WE- FIRST RELEASE OUR SAFETY NET PLAN IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN- OUR SAFETY NET PLAN HAD BEEN- INFORMED THROUGH STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND THEN DURING THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS SO WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TAKE A LOOK AT THE- THE INFORMATION- AVAILABLE TO US- TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHERE DO WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS. TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN A DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS- THE AGENDA NOTES A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT SERVICE MODELS AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN-PROVIDING- LET STEP ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE'RE DOING AND OUR SAFETY NET AND THE PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIALIZED RESOURCES- THAT WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING I DO WANT TO NOTE- AND AGAIN IT'S CORRECTLY NOTED AND THE- THE AGENDA THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TWENTY POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUN NINETEEN. MILLION AS GENERAL FUND AND RELATED- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- FOR A COUPLE OF THOSE ITEMS THERE ARE TWENTY- ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE IDENTIFYING TO INCREASE OUR CENSUS OVER AT PORTER BILL SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM SO IT WOULD TEMPORARILY INCREASE OUR CENSUS- TO RELIEVE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN JAIL THAT HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH A FELONY AND- ON- NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE COMPETENCY DETERMINED- SO BECAUSE WE ARE SEEINGLONGER WAIT LIST- AND LONGER WAIT TIME- FOR INDIVIDUALS IN JAIL THAT WERE WERE PROPOSING TO TEMPORARILY- INCREASE TO THE- ADDITIONAL TWENTY BEDS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEN WE ARE PROPOSING TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL EBS H. HOMES- THERE ARE THE AND HAS BEEN HERE REAL SUPPORTS HOMES THAT WERE ONE OF THE NEW. THROUGH THE SAFETY NETWORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- AND BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY SO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AT PORTER BILL SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM. THAT REALLY CAN'T TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY WITH SUPPORTS THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE POPULATION AND SO- DURING THAT TIME IS WERE. REDUCING THAT POPULATION AND THEN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AND WRAP AROUND. TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I'M IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND SO WE WOULD NOT RELY ON THAT INCREASED CENSUS. BE IT BEYOND THAT THE END DATE THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED. THERE'S A AN ADDITIONAL ITEM THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE NOTE OF- WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL- WE HAD DEVELOPED AT WHAT'S CALLED THE START PROGRAM. AND IT'S CALLED A SYSTEMIC THERAPEUTIC ASSESSMENT RESOURCES AND TREATMENT- IT IS AN EVIDENCE BASED ON PERSON CENTERED INFORMED IT TRAUMA INFORMED- MODEL. THAT IS- SOMETHING THAT WE BROUGHT INTO CALIFORNIA WE PILOTED IF YOU WILL- WITH TO REGIONAL CENTERS SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER IN SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD IS AND WE'VE- IDENTIFIED IN OUR SAFETY KNOWS THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO INSTEAD OF JUST DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES. ON THE ACUTE SIDE TO WEAR WERE STABILIZING WHEN SOMEBODY IS KIND OF GETTING TO THAT ACUTE- STAGE AND HAVING TO GET STABILITY OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY HOME. IN DOING MORE THE PREVENTATIVE WORK AND MAKING pTHE EARLY KIND IDENTIFICATION AND SUPPORTS. SO THIS WAS ONE MODEL THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT PROVIDES A LIFESPAN SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALS- IT REALLY IS ABOUT STABILIZING THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE HOME. I'M IS TWENTY FOUR HOUR CASE COORDINATION AND IT'S CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS THE FAMILY AND ON THE INDIVIDUAL WITH OTHER SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO HELP KIND OF WRAP THAT. SUPPORT SERVICES OF VERY HOLISTIC WRAPAROUND SUPPORT MODEL THAT- WE HAVE SEEN TO PROVE SOME- ALREADY POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU TODAY. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE PARTICIPANTS- AS I SAID IT SAN ANDREAS AND SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. SEVENTY OUR CHILDREN'S NINETY THREE ADULTS- 85% OF THE CHILDREN 50% OF ADULTS ACTUALLY LIVE IN THEIR FAMILY HOME. WE ARE WE'RE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE HOSPITALIZATIONS SO SINCE- SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THOSE PARTICIPANTS WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE BY. 92% OF THE COST PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS STATIONS ON A- THESE AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN A REDUCTION OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS EMERGENCY ROOMS AT THE HOSPITAL'S. DECLINED AT 87% FOR CHILDREN IN ARE LIVING AT THE HOME. SO OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES- FOR ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO START UP IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- AND I KNOW THE AGENDA. HAD NOTED THE AND THE LA ALWAYS ASK SOME QUESTIONS AS TO WHERE WOULD WE IDENTIFY THOSE- OUR STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY. THOSE AREAS IN WHICH WE WOULD PRIORITIZE IS LOOKING IN AND THE THERE'S A MAP IN THE AGENDA THAT GIVES YOU A REFERENCE TO WHERE WE HAVE OUR- CRISIS- A Q. CRISIS SERVICES BOTH ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE AND THEN OUR CAST WHICH IS STATE OPERATED. WHICH IS A MOBILE TEAM AND THEN ALSO IDENTIFYING WHERE WE HAVE OTHERS THE START SERVICES SO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THOSE REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE RESOURCES. SO WE CAN REALLY DO A COMPLIMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND START BALANCING SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES WHAT'S NICE ABOUT HAVING A MULTIPLE APPROACH WE CAN START SEEN WHAT IS THIS. WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE TELLING US AND SOME BEST PRACTICES- TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. APARTMENT FINANCE. I JUST TO SUMMARIZE A COUPLE OF THAT DIRECTOR BY IN MAY IN REAL TO THE BUILDING I OF COULD PASS A POOR SO TREAT PROGRAM NOTING THE SENSE OF BUILDING OUT CAPACITY- AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER HOWEVER WE DO FEEL THAT FOLKS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED AT PORTER BILL RATHER THAN COUNTY JAIL IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT AND THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF BUILDING OUT THE TWENTY BET UNIT AND SECONDARILY JUST THE WITH THE SAFETY NET PLAN IN THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING NOTING THAT THE SAFETY NET PLAN TRADITIONALLY AS REFLECTED MORE BUILDING OUT CAPACITY- THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON A PREVENTATIVE ASPECT WHICH IS A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SO YOU PICK FROM THE LA. WE WANT TO. A FEW. A THIS NET. PLAN THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN TALK ABOUT THE TO- SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. SO WE KNOW WHAT A SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE FOUND- VERY HELPFUL ABOUT THE PLAN THAT WAS DELIVERED ON JANUARY TENTH- FIRST IT PROVIDED HELPFUL UPDATES ABOUT THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FUNDED- IT PROVIDED AS- SORT OF HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE VARIOUS SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE- IT PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF IT THE NEW FOCUS ON PREVENTION AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE JUST MENTIONED- YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW PREVENTION PREVENTION OF CRISES IS BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BETTER FOR THE FAMILY BETTER FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IT'S LESS COSTLY- IT ALSO PROVIDES GREAT CONTEXT ON THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE PERSON'S SERVED INCLUDING THE GROWING RATES OF AUTISM AND CO OCCURRING. MENTAL HEALTH. ATTACHED ISSUES- IT ALSO PRESENTS SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT WE DO FIND THAT THE PLAN DOES- LACKS CERTAIN SPACES SPECIFICITY IN A FEW AREAS- PRIMARILY IT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE A PLAN THAT LOOKS FORWARD IT'S AS SOMEWHAT MORE OF A STATUS UPDATE- IT WOULD BE GREAT. IF THE PLAN HAD SOME HAD. OF NOT ONLY THE OVER ARCHING GOALS THAT ARE IN THE PLAN BUT BUT SPECIFIC GOALS WITH MEASURABLE TARGETS- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOPES TO ACHIEVE- THE ACTIVITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD UNDERTAKE TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND HOW THEY WILL KNOW THAT THOSE VARIOUS EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. OR WHETHER THEY NEED REFINEMENT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A DISK OF HOW DATA IS USED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS- THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A LOT OF GREAT DATA ABOUT THIS POPULATION- AND THEIR VARIOUS NEEDS BUT WE DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW THOSE- THAT INFORMATION TRANSLATES INTO THESE REQUESTS THAT COME FORWARD EACH YEAR- AND THEN IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE AN EXPLANATION OF HOW CERTAIN PROJECTS ARE PRIORITIZED OVER OTHERS AND SO WITHOUT SORT OF KNOWING HOW THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE IT'S DIFFICULT ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS TO ASSESS- THE PARTICULAR PROPOSALS THAT COME FORWARD EACH YEAR- SO WE WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SORRY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO PRESS THE DEPARTMENT FOR THOSE TYPES OF. DETAILS IT WOULD BE IN YOU KNOW ALONG THE LINES OF HAVING A ROAD MAP ABOUT WERE WE'RE THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO GO IN TERMS OF SAFETY NET PLANNING ON THE TO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT ARE PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE TEMPORARY CAPACITY ADDITIONAL CAPACITY OF TWENTY BEDS AT PORTER BILL OF COUPLED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE NEW ENHANCE BEHAVIORAL SUPPORTS HOMES- THAT INCLUDE DELAYED EGRESS AND SECURED PERIMETER THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED SOME GREAT BACKUP INFORMATION TO. SUPPORT WHY THIS WOULD- SERVES THE CONSUMER POPULATION WELL. WE ALSO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE START PREVENTION SERVICES THAT TO- DIRECTOR BARGE MEN DESCRIBED. I'M TYPICALLY YOU KNOW SHE MENTIONED THAT THIS PROGRAM IS BEING PILOTED IT INTO REGIONAL CENTER AREAS. AND TYPICALLY YOU WOULD AWAIT THE RESULTS OF A PILOT PROGRAM BEFORE USE YOUR RAMPS IT UPPER SCALE THAT UP. A BIT WE WOULD NOTED IN THIS CASE IT MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED TO MOVE FORWARD ANYWAY BECAUSE- PREVENTION AGAIN OF CRISES ARE IS VERY KEY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS BEEN TESTED IN OTHER STATES IT'S IT IS AN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM- WE ALSO KNOW THAT. USING THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT DATA HAS TO BE COLLECTED- THAT'S A REQUIREMENT OF USING THIS MODEL. WHICH IS A GOOD THING- IT ALSO TRAINS SORT OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED A TRAINS THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS THE FAMILY MEMBERS THE REGIONAL CENTERS- DIRECTOR BRIDGMAN PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION ABOUT- WHICH REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE SELECTED FOR THIS- EXPANSION AND SO. I GUESS THE ONE REMAINING QUESTION THEN WOULD BE WHEN WILL THEY DECIDE WHICH- REGIONAL CENTERS AND WHEN WITH THE LEGISLATURE KNOW. WHICH SPECIFIC REGIONAL CENTERS. THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME WE WILL A COUPLE COMMENT ISSUE FOR. HELLO JORDAN'S ON BEHALF OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA I'M WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEE IN VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE MISTRESS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND CAPACITY PORTABLE- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE TO- GET. EXPAND CAPACITY AVAILABLE CENTER BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN CRISIS IN A COUNTY JAIL OR IN A JAIL THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE COLLABORATION IN THAT IS NEEDED BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND OUR SYSTEM IN EVERY LOTS OF IN THIS ROOM AND EVERYBODY IS WORKING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS- IMPORTANT CRITICAL NEED FOR THE COMMUNION SO IN STRONG SUPPORT. HELLO I'M JACQUI BELL ACOSTA THE CALIFORNIA'S PARTY LIVING NETWORK. WHAT IS THIS A COUPLE OF POINTS ON THE SAFETY NET. IS A REALLY THINK THAT WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THE HOUSE. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF. GOOD MEDICAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO FOLKS THAT GO INTO CRISIS THAT'S ONE THE OTHER ONE IS I'M HOPING THAT. THE CONVERSATION BEGINS TO HAPPEN AROUND SUPPORTED LIVING AND THE SAFETY NET SUPPORT SERVICES. MANY SUPPORT OF LIVING PROVIDERS PRIOR TO THE SAFETY NET OR THE SAFETY NET. ARE YOU I MYSELF AND MY AGENCIES OR FORTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY IN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. I CURRENTLY SERVE FOLKS IN SUPPORT OF LIVING THAT LEFT THE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOME. SO I THINK WE NEED TO START HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO SUIT SUPPORTED LIVING. AND YOU PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT THERE'S NO NEED TO MOVE ON. THE SUPPORT STAYS WHERE IT'S AT I AM IN SUPPORT OF HAVING THE PARENTS AND THE FAMILIES GET THE SUPPORT IN THE HOME. YOU BEGIN TO MITIGATE A LOT OF THOSE WHEN FAMILIES CAN HAVE THAT ENHANCE SUPPORT AND SERVICES. IN A CRISIS SITUATION I JUST THINK THE SAME THING NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN OUR ADULT COMMUNITY SO THEY DON'T END UP NEEDING. THE SERVICES OF A C. C. H. S. OR AND B. S. C. H. BUT IF WE CAN FOR. A WHOLE. A TO PEOPLE IN. WHERE THEY LIVE. THAT MAYBE WE BEGIN TO MOVE THE SYSTEM FOR IN A MUCH. MORE PROGRESSIVE. THANK YOU MA'AM. I'M ALISON MARIE DISABILITY YOU KNOW. I SO I THINK ALL THREE INCH COME ARE INTEREST AND THE FIRST TWO I A WHOLE AGREE WITH LA- THAT IF THE ALTERNATIVE IS JAIL- WHICH IT OFTEN IS- THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CRITICAL AN OVERDUE STEP- PEOPLE WITH ID DE HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN REGULAR JAILS IT'S A HORRIBLE PLACE TO BE- THEY ARE VULNERABLE THEIR RISK IN THOSE SETTINGS AND SO I THINK ALTHOUGH CLEARLY I WHOLE HEARTEDLY WITH THE LAST YOU KNOW THE LAST COM IS IMPORTANT I MEAN WE WANT TO PROVIDE PREVENTION IS CRITICAL. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE ARE READY CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY MAKING ADDITIONAL SPACE AVAILABLE IN PORTER VEIL AND BUILDING OUT THE CAPACITY IN THE COMMUNITY. MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND IS SO IMPORTANT- SO I THINK THOSE TWO PIECES ARE OURS AGIN LONG OVERDUE. I THINK ON THE START PROGRAM- IT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS VERY PROMISING- AND IT HAS BEEN TRIED IN OTHER STATES WHICH IS A GOOD THING- BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHY INDEPENDENT EVALUATION IS SO IMPORTANT- BECAUSE AFTER ALL CALIFORNIA'S DIFFERENT IN SO MANY WAYS SOME OF WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING. ON THE FACT THAT IT'S WORKED IN OTHER STATES WELL IS VERY ENCOURAGING AND I THINK THE STATISTICS- THAT DIRECTOR BIRDMAN CITED ARE ALSO ENCOURAGING BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THOSE ARE NOT REALLY A SUBSTITUTE FOR INDEPENDENT EVALUATION WHY- WELL IN PART BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE GOING ON WITH THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE INCLUDED. RIGHT EVEN IF THEIR RATES ARE GOING DOWN IT COULD BE THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERVENTION THEY'RE GETTING OTHER KINDS OF INTERVENTION THEY'RE ACCESSING GENERIC RESOURCES THEY'RE ACCESSING BETTER MEDICAL CARE. AND THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THIS INTERVENTION PER SE THAT'S HELPING THEM BUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COMING TO THEM AT THE SAME TIME- I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW EITHER WAY BUT I THINK IT THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY. SORT OF ENABLING AND THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO ENABLE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION IT COULD BE MAKING THE DATA AVAILABLE AND DE IDENTIFIED FORM SO THAT THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WHICH IS ROBUST IN LARGE IN CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW CAN ANALYZE AND SEE IS IT REALLY THIS INTERVENTION OR OTHER THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND SAME TIME. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE OF THIS IS GONNA BE REPLICATED IN OTHER- REGIONAL CENTERS IS IT SEEMS IT WILL BE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WHETHER IT'S CORRELATIONAL AND WHETHER WHAT WE'VE ENCOURAGING THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES ARE ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. THANK YOU. YOU KATIE HARDER DISABILITY CAL. ON WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THERE. OF THE BED CAP THAT PORTER FELL. ON NEED UP BE NASA. AND CERTAINLY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE DURATION. OF THE WRITTEN IN THE TRAILER BILL CURRENTLY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AT. PORTERFIELD DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHO MAY BE READY TO TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND NEED A COMMUNITY PLACEMENT. ON FOUND FOR THEM. BOB WE ALSO- BELIEVE THAT IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT ALIGNING THE I. D. D. DIVERSION STATUTES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION STATUTE THAT COULD REDUCE OUR JAIL POPULATION. M. M. ALSO IN TERMS OF. THE RESOURCES FOR OUR I. S. TEAS- IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAD. INCLUDED COMMUNITY BED SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE IN THE I. S. T. SITUATION AND UNFORTUNATELY- GIVEN COMPETING DEMANDS ON THEIR ATTENTION THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T PRIORITIZE THAT DEVELOPMENT. AND SO PRIORITIZING THAT DEVELOPMENT COULD ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE EXPANSION IMPORTER BILL MIGHT WELL BE NECESSARY. THE OTHER THING IN REGARDS TO THE- FIVE ADDITIONAL EBS AGES THE STAFF AT THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY ARE HEAVILY INVOLVED. ON BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR SUPPORT TEAMS AND REALLY SUPPORT THOSE PLACEMENTS AND FIND THEM TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR OUR CLIENTS. HOWEVER WE HAVE TO CAPS RUNNING AND WE REALLY NEED TO ALIGN THOSE CAPS PARTICULARLY IF WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASING ON THOSE THOSE BEDS IN THIS YEAR. THANK YOU GIVE. AMY WESTLING THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY IN EXCESS OF TWENTY PEOPLE CURRENTLY WAITING TO GET INTO A PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO WE VIEW THIS AS- UNNECESSARY START TO MEETING THEIR NEEDS OF COURSE WANT TO TRANSITION PEOPLE. FROM PORTER BILL INTO THE COMMUNITY AS IT'S SAFE AND APPROPRIATE BUT RECOGNIZE THAT AS THE POPULATION GROWS AND CONTINUES TO GET MORE COMPLEX. THAT THIS MAY BE A NECESSARY STEP AGAIN ALSO APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL AND SUPPORTED FOR THE EXPANSION. OF THE CAST SERVICES- I'M SORRY THE START. AS WE HAVE WAY TOO MANY ACRONYMS IN OUR SYSTEM AND I TRY TO KEEP THEM ALL STRAIGHT AND SOMETIMES FAIL BUT THE START SERVICES AS- MANY BEFORE ME HAVE NOTED THE- IMPORTANCE OF INTERVENING AHEAD OF CRISIS IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO IS A SYSTEM BUT AS- I SAID A MINUTE AGO. WHEN SOMEONE'S INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE REALLY DO NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MOVE THEM OUT OF COUNTY JAILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ALL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- AND I'D LIKE TO ECHO THAT LAST COMMENT IF I COULD AS WELL AS WHAT THE LA HAD SAID LAST YEAR. WHICH IS THAT MOVING THE SYSTEM MORE TOWARDS PREVENTION OF CRISES AND AWAY FROM HAVING TO RESPOND TO CRISES IS IMPORTANT. AND I WOULD JUST. ALSO WANTS TO AGREE THAT ESTABLISHING PORTERVILLE AND TAKING OUR DD POPULATION OUT OF JAILS WILL HELP US TO PREVENT SOME OF THOSE CRISES FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE AS WELL IF I COULD. REGARDING WE HAD RECEIVED A PLAN AND- FOR THE SAFETY NET SERVICES AND- TO BE FAIR IT SEEMED MORE LIKE A TIME LINE FOR HOW WE GOT TO TODAY WITHOUT A- PLAN LOOKING FORWARD WITH REGARDS TO WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND SO. HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT PLANNED FOR SAFETY NET SERVICES AND HOME DEVELOPMENT MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU WANT- AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE AND THE RELATED WORK GROUPS- REALLY IMPORTANT WORK GROUPS- ONE OF THEM- DEFINITELY FOCUSES ON SAFETY NET AND ALSO A FOCUS ON COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT- WE HAVE- THE- THE- GIMME PLACEMENT PLAN WHICH IS ALSO PART COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ANNUALLY E HAVE APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY SEVEN MILLION THAT REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE ACCESS TO DEVELOP RESOURCES PART OF THE ELEMENTS THAT IT'S REQUIRED AND THAT IS TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST THAT'S COMING TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO A NUMBER OF THOSE AREAS IN WHICH WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS TO BRING THAT INFORMATION- TICKET TO ASSESS THE SAFETY NET AND- WORK WITH THE DS TASK FORCE TO IDENTIFY THOSE DATA POINTS IN THOSE DATA ELEMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO INFORM US TO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FUTURE NEEDS- WE DO KNOW THAT WE CAN- TAKE A LOOK AT TRENDS. I'M INFORMATION TO PROJECT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE KIND OF THE PLANS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WHAT SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW BENEFIT OF WORKING WITH OTHER STATES AND GET AN IDEA AS TO WHAT THEIR STRATEGIES ARE OR WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MAY BE EMERGING THAT WERE NOT AS AWARE OF- AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE SENSITIVE TO AND- AND WANT TO BE- OPEN TO AND HAVE TO. REACT TO AS OPPOSED TO ALWAYS PLANNED BUT WE DO APPRECIATE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR TASK FORCE TO DO THAT. IF I MAY I'D COME LIKE TO END WITH THE REQUEST AGAIN AND THAT WOULD BE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A DETAILED APPROACH IN WRITING OF THIS STRATEGIC. PLAN PROCESS IT USES FOR THE SAFETY NET SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. TO INFORM OUR ASSESSMENT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR SAFETY NET SPENDING. PRIORITIES AND IF I. COULD ECHO WHAT THE LA- HAD SAID. TO ASK FOR YOU TO INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC REGIONS THAT REMAIN WITHOUT SAFETY NET SERVICES ON THE MAP- I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO. LOOK AT THE GREAT CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- ASSIST SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE AND ON WHAT TIME FOR AN- THIS FEATURE ONLY NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE QUARTERLY LEGISLATIVE BRIEFINGS WHICH MAY SERVE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON THESE TYPES OF TOPICS TO THE EXTENT THAT WORKS FOR YOU THAT. MIGHT BE THE APPROPRIATE FORM TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON THE SAFETY NET PLAN. MOVING FORWARD. WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD HAVE IT PRIOR TO MAY REVISE AS WE WILL THEN BE MAKING A DECISION REGARDING THE- SAFETY NET- PROPOSAL AND SO. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW BY THAT TIME FRAME IF THAT WORKED WITHIN THE QUARTERLY MEETINGS. THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE SO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE SIX. HI. CAN RECORD FOR ME. DO. GOOD EVENING. CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS KEVIN ROTH AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MODELS. THAT MINUS WE EMPLOY OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS THAT SERVE MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO EAST BAY. I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORKS. AND AMMAN TO THE DISABILITY WORKGROUP TASK FORCE FOR GROUPS ON THE STRUCTURAL ON IN EQUITY ONE. SO FROM THE STATE CONTINUES TO INCREASE EXPENDITURES AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE LARGE NUMBER OF NEW INDIVIDUALS. AND RECEIVING SERVICES AND THE RISING STATE MINIMUM WAGE EVEN SO THE STATE READ STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE SYSTEM IS UNDERFUNDED BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT. ON THE STATE'S RESOURCES MUST BE USED MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE. SUPPORTING THE SERVICE AN OUTCOME INITIATIVE. THIS UNIQUE INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE TARGETING OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. BY DEFINING DELIVERING AND MEASURING QUALITY SERVICES. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT THOSE DEFINITIONS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST AT THE STATE OR NATIONAL LEVEL. MUCH LESS THE TOOLS TO MEASURE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY. IT THESE DEFINITIONS IN MEASUREMENTS OF QUALITY SERVICES ARE NEEDED TO FORM A SYSTEM THAT HELPS THE STATE TARGET RESOURCES TOWARDS QUALITY PROGRAMS WITH PROVEN OUTCOMES. THE METHOD FOR DEVELOPING THESE QUALITY SERVICES HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE. THE METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO THAT CALIFORNIA'S BORDER LIVING NETWORK PAY PROJECT PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY VISION AND EDUCATION. PROJECTS PRIMARY FUNDER IS THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AS WE DEVELOP THE BLUEPRINT FOR QUALITY SERVICES INCREASING INTEREST ABOUT THE APPROACH LEAD ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SPEAKER PRO TEM KEVIN MULLIN TO SPONSOR THE SERVICE OUT COMMISSION OF WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN FOR HIS SUPPORT. AND HIS VISION. EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE NATION HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN CS ISLANDS APPROACH TO QUALITY SERVICES. DOCTOR DIDN'T CHEN DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL CHAPEL HILL ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION HAS THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE OUTCOME INITIATIVE. FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS I'M EVEN MORE CONVINCED THAT THIS INITIATIVE WILL HELP STATE OF CALIFORNIA SIGNIFICANTLY QUANTIFY THE SERVICES NEEDED TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER. I'M SURE WE CAN CREATE EVIDENCE BASED SERVICE OUTCOME TOOL BOXES TO MEASURE SERVICE IMPROVE SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO CONTACT WITH- NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN EXPERTS SUCH AS DR JULIE BEAT. BEAD BROWN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENT ENGLAND. THE NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM WHICH CREATED THE DISABILITY SERVICE RESEARCH THE DOMAINS TO THE GUIDE TO GUIDE FEDERAL FUNDING- IS MEETING WITH CL AND IN TWO WEEKS IN WASHINGTON. THE FORM HAS STATED THAT IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR APPROACH CALIFORNIA WILL LEAD THE WAY. IN DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING QUALITY DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES. TO THESE CONVERSATIONS RECENT CONVERSATIONS AND OTHERS WE OWE FORMING AND NETWORK EXPERTS THAT WILL BRING NEW INSIGHTS AND TOOLS INTO THE CALIFORNIA DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICE SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO BUILD ON THESE RESULTS ON A HEY AND MAINTAIN A CONTINUED EFFORT TO CREATE QUALITY SERVICES THE OUTCOME INITIATIVE NEEDS TO BE FUNDED THIS YEAR. WE NEED TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK ON A LARGER SCALE AND CREATE A PILOT PROJECT TO TEST THE SOFTWARE DATA COLLECTION STAFF TRAINING. QUALITY DEFINITIONS AND MEASUREMENTS. THE TWO MILLION BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW US TO PLAN PILOT AND PROVE THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE QUALITY SERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OVERCOMING THE CURRENT OUTCOME RATE IMPASSE. WORKING WITH YOU AND THE STATE WE BELIEVE WE CAN JUMP START THIS PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR DIRECTOR PARCHMAN ANY COMMENTS SORRY. NEXT ON OUR AGENDA NO SAVE IT TO LATER THAT'S OKAY TOO NO THANK YOU I- APPRECIATED- MISTER AT JOINING AND COMING TO OUR OFFICE AND GET PROVIDING US AN OVERVIEW- BUT- NO COMMENTS ON ON THE PROPOSAL IS NOT OURS THANK YOU. BERMAN FINANCE LA. ECHOING DIRECTOR BARGES COMMENTS WE APPRECIATED THE TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WERE AWARE OF IT BUT YOU'RE NOT A POSITION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. I AM NOT GOING TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD EVENING. THE STRONG WILLED WILL SURVIVE I'M JACKI BUILT FOR US ONCE AGAIN I AM OBVIOUSLY SAID IN AND- SUPPORT OF THE DEATH OF DISABILITY SERVICE OUTCOME INITIATIVE I THINK IT'S BEEN A MISSION OF ME IN MY AGENCY THE LAST TWENTY SIX YEARS OF DOING THIS. I'M HOPING THAT BY THE TIME I RETIRE I LOOK IN THE DISTANT FUTURE THAT WILL HAVE REALLY GOOD QUALITY DSP TRAINING THAT LEAD TO DATA THAT LEAD TO OUTCOMES BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK WHEN I TALK TO MY TEAM AND SAY WHAT ARE THE SERVICE OUTCOMES WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED TO DO I THINK WHAT THEY THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR IT'S COME BACK TO THE CAPITAL AND CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT RATES AND WAGES THAT IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION. IT'S CRITICAL BUT A PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY HAVING QUALITY SERVICES LIFE OUTCOMES THAT ARE THEY'RE CHOOSING CAN'T BE DELAYED BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A RATE CONVERSATION I'M ASSUMING ON THE DAY I RETIRE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE CAPITAL AND I WILL HAVE BEEN RETIRED AND STILL TALK ABOUT RATES I'M I'M PRETTY MUCH PREDICTING THAT FUTURE FOR ME BUT I ALSO THINK THAT I HOPE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE DISABILITY SERVICES TRAINING THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS. CAN WE DECIDE THAT A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL IS THAT I WAS THAT THE WORK FORCE CRISIS SUMMIT WAY MISSOURI AND A TORNADO WARNING TALK ABOUT THE WORK FORCE CRISIS NATIONALLY THERE ARE THE SAME CONVERSATIONS WATER OUTCOMES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTCOMES ARE WE KNOW WE'RE UNDER FUNDED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTCOMES ARE IT'S NOT ABOUT. TASK ANALYSIS THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU CHIEF HEALTH AND WELLNESS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOSPITALIZATION TO THE REDUCTION OF HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR THAT PILOT PROJECT WHEN I HEARD DIRECTOR BARS WE TALK ABOUT THAT ON LIKE THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT INFORMATION FOR US TO TRACK IN OUR SYSTEM AS A WHOLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU COULDN'T SAY HOW MANY PEOPLE BASED ON THE TRAINING THEY RECEIVE IN THE PROGRAM THERE IN REDUCE THEIR HOSPITALIZATIONS BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS RATED THEY RECEIVE. WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW THIS FROM THIS PILOT. BUT THERE'S THREE AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR SO LET'S START BEGINNING TO HAVE THAT HARD CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. MY PLANTS AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK I OBVIOUSLY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE- BUDGET REQUEST- YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS PUBLIC COMMEN- WE ARE IN PHASE ONE RIGHT NOW- WE ARE WORKING WITH ON THE STATE COUNCIL GRANTS ON THE PAVE PROJECT PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY VISION AND EDUCATION- WE DANCE. ASSEMBLED AN AMAZING ADVISORY GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY- PEOPLE SERVED PARENTS PROVIDERS- AND- JUST STAKEHOLDERS. ON THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW THE STATE COUNCIL TO IMMEDIATELY BAD BE READY TO MOVE FORWARD ON. ON TO PHASE TWO- I'M AT THE COMPLETION OF THE GRANTS- IT'S A NECESSARY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I CONTEND THAT THIS NO EXCUSE NOT TO ADDRESS IMPROVED QUALITY OF SERVICES IN AN UNDER FUNDED SYSTEM- THAT. CAN BE ACHIEVED BY DEFINING NATURALS MEASURABLE% SERVICE OUTCOMES COLLECTING AND REPORTING DATA AND COURSE CORRECTING ALONG THE WAY. WE ASK THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BE FUNDED IN THIS BUDGET WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO GOOD EVENING I MY NAME IS GINNY WAS THE ARE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR MONO SOME CARE. AND I'M ALSO SERVING AS A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- AS YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER APPARENT FROM CAL TASH SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. OF SECURING A QUALITY STAFFING FOR RESPITE SERVICES AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT IN SUPPORT OF OUR ORGANIZATION FOR THIS BUDGET REQUEST. I REALLY DO HOPE THAT YOU HOLD A CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. YES I COULD SAY ONE THING. IT I- IT WAS VERY TOUCHING HERE THE PARENTS BECAUSE WE DO RESPITE TOUGH. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SYSTEM IS UNDERFUNDED BELIEVE ME WE JUST HAD AN EMERGENCY MEETING AT OUR AGENCY BECAUSE WE LOST MONEY- SO THIS CRISIS GOES ON AND ON. SO AND I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT OF SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS IT SAY. WE IT'S CHANGED IT'S RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT SERVICE OUTCOMES- WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN GET STAFF I UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S A MISPERCEPTION OF OUR PROPOSAL. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE OUTCOMES SERVICE DELIVERY OUTCOMES RIGHT- WE TALK ABOUT MEASURING THEM WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BEATING UP SERVICE PROVIDERS A CAN'T MAKE THEM THE SERVICING THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE WE SHOULD BE MEASURING HOW THE IMPACT OF THE UNDER FUNDED SYSTEM AFFECTS QUALITY WE CAN'T DO THAT. WITHOUT DETERMINING SERVICE DELIVER QUALITY SO. A WEEK WE CAN'T EVEN IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES% IN AN UNDERFUNDED SYSTEM AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SO THAT WHEN THERE'S OF WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS IN FUNDING- IT'S EASY TO CUT. THIS THE BUDGET LIKE IT HAPPENED IN THE LAST GREAT RECESSION RIGHT WHERE THEY JUST CUT IT BY FOUR POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT- BECAUSE- WE COULDN'T DEMONSTRATE. WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT WAS AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INITIATIVE IS NOT ABOUT. A IGNORING THE RATE STUDY OR IGNORING UNDERFUNDED- NATURE OF OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU SIR- AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. WE'RE GETTING PAST A CERTAIN HOUR I MADE JUST- ASK THAT WE PREPARE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON EACH OF THESE REMAINING ISSUES SO. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK YOU MAY WANT TO START WINDING UP NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- BERRY JOURNEY FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND I AND I PRESENT TONIGHT ON A PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TWO MEN TO PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN- THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM IN THE CA INCENTIVES PROGRAM THAT WERE BOTH DESIGNED TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT AND COMPETITIVE IN A GREAT EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SINCE THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WE'VE APPROPRIATED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- WE'RE IN THE FOURTH YEAR NOW IT'S PROPOSED TO CONTINUE NEXT YEAR- TO FUND THOSE PROGRAMS TO. TO ACHIEVE MORE CHAU COMES WHICH IS IN LINE WITH STATE POLICY IN THE APPOINT FIRST POLICY AND CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE OUTCOMES GOALS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TONIGHT- UNFORTUNATELY THE RAMP UP ON THIS PROGRAMS HIS IS. TAKEN IT'S TAKEN A WHILE THE FIRST YEAR WE SPENT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TWENTY NINE WE SEND FOUR POINT SIX AND THEN SEVEN POINT SEVEN IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE FULL DATA. WE ARE PROPOSING A COUPLE OF FIXES TO THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SIDE THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WERE OPTIMIZING THE LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITY CURRENTLY PROVIDE IN CONSUMERS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE AN EARNINGS CAP OF TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE PROGRAM. WHEN THIS WENT INTO. EFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE STATE WAS TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR- AS THE MINIMUM WAGE IS INCREASED THE ACTUAL OPPORTUNITY UNDER THAT EARNINGS CAP HAS DECREASED BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HIT THAT EARNINGS CAP FASTER SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO SWITCH FROM ATTORNEYS CAPTAIN HOURS CAP. WHICH REFLECTS THE LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS IN PLACE WHEN THE PROGRAM WENT INTO PLACE AT ONE THOUSAND FORTY HOURS. PER YEAR AND WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING THAT PROVIDERS WOULD BE ABLE TO- GET AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE FOR FACILITATING THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM CURRENTLY. MOST PROVIDERS WHO WHO DO THESE THINGS DON'T GET ANY SORT OF RECOGNITION OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR FACILITATING DOING THE PAPERWORK THOSE TYPES OF THINGS FOR THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SO WE WOULD PUT A FIFTEEN PERCENT- ADMINISTRATIVE FEE ON THAT WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE FOR OTHER SERVICES THE OTHER. THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES PROGRAM. WE ARE PROPOSING TO DOUBLE THE LEVEL OF THE INCENTIVES FOR BOTH THE THIRTY DAY SIX MONTH AND ONE YEAR MARKS. I'M FROM THEIR CURRENT EXISTING AMOUNTS IN STATUTE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL FACILITATE MORE JOB DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYMENT EXPLORATION JOB DISCOVERY. THERE'S CURRENTLY A NOT SYSTEMATIC SYSTEMATICALLY FUNDED FOR PROVIDERS. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AGREEMENT THEY COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IS AN OUTCOME THAT WE WANT TO DRIVE TOWARDS FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING IT. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FACILITATE A LANDSCAPE THAT- PROVIDES ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR- PROVIDERS TO. TO MAKE THAT A REALITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIO. OF WE HAVE A NO POSITION AT THIS TIME WE ARE AWARE OF IT WITH THE OF THE PROPOSED AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MR TARTINI ON PROVIDING SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU. THANK SONY PARTICULARLY- I JUST HOPE TO MAKE SORT OF A LARGER POINT- GOING BACK TO THE EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THAT IS IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO REJECTED THAT PROPOSAL OR AT LEAST REJECTED IN SOME SOME FORM THIS- SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES- COULD BE USED TO TEST. INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND I REALIZE THAT- PART OF THIS ALREADY IS AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT OF PROGRAM HOWEVER THE RULES THE RESULT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS SPENT HAVE BEEN PRETTY MODEST AND THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT THINK ABOUT HOW TO RESTRUCTURE THE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS- RETRIEVE THE GOALS THAT IT HOPES TO ACHIEVE AND SO SOME OF THE RESTRUCTURING COULD INCLUDE THE OPTIONS THAT MISTER JOURNEY- PRESENTED- COULD INCLUDE SOME OTHER OPTIONS BUT IT MIGHT BE- A WAY TO SORT OF. EASE INTO PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES- AS A PILOT THANK YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT TIME TO ADDRESS THIS PROPOSAL IF YOU SO WISH. WE ALSO SIMILAR TO FINANCE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. HI THANK YOU HARRY PEARL WITH PATH POINT- JUST WANT TO GIVE STRONG SUPPORT TO IT I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY IN THE SYSTEM THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING. REALLY HELP SUSTAINABILITY THAT RETURN FOLKS AND THE TAXPAYERS AND BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THIS IS A JUST A MAYORAL COMMONSENSE WAY NO ADDITIONAL DOLLARS BUT A WAY TO REALLY INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE GETTING OUT WORKING BEING PART OF THE COMMUNITY OUR SOCIETY UNFORTUNATELY IS A LOT TIMES WORTH IN TERMS OF A JOB IN A PAYCHECK AND THIS PURCHASE MORE MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES REDUCING HUGE BENEFITS PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SEE A PAYMENT SO I APPRECIATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSAL AND THE WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT AGENCIES STERN ON IT. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. WELL CENTER COMMUNITY CONSULTANTS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO EXPAND EMPLOYMENT FOR FOLKS LADY DI FOR FORTY YEARS. THIS IS ACTUALLY THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS CAME IN PLACES ACSI OPEN DOORSTHAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO OUR FOLKS OF THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. REALLY IS A WAY FOR US TO HAVE PEOPLE BYPASS- THE INTERVIEW PROCESS- THE CASE IN POINT IS A STATE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT SAID TEN PEOPLE IN IT. SEVEN WHICH ARE NOW STATE EMPLOYEES. THAT SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT REHAB IS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PULL OFF THE CONVEYOR HAD EXPANDED. BUT HAVING A PULL UP IT WAS AVAIL BECAUSE OF THAT PROGRAM. ALSO COMING EARLY THE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE. HAVE COMPETITIVE GRATED JOBS TODAY THE THREE AGO THREE YEARS AGO DIDN'T. THAT DOUBLE THE DOUBLE THAT 50% MORE PEOPLE WE HAD IN CA NINETY FOUR. THOSE ARE HUGE NUMBERS AND I AGREE THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT. I WOULD ARGUE ON THE FLIP SIDE IS. WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT SOME OF THE BUREAUCRACY SO CAN HAPPEN QUICKER. IN AND SET UP PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ASKING THE- INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SO I THINK OURS IS A MUCH EASIER THING TO TRACK THEM DOLLARS FOR OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME'S ERIC KERRISON WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF A MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR. A PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SIR. OTHERS WITH A STAKE COUNSELING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE HAVE- EMPLOYED THREE PEOPLE IN THE STATE COUNCIL FOR OFFICES TO THIS PROGRAM WE FIND AGREED INDIVIDUALS GREAT SKILLS AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TINKER TO IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM TO MAKE IT BETTER I'M PLEASE CONSIDER THE ONE YOUR TIME FRAME. EXPANDING IT TO TWO YEARS AND WE FIND THE PEOPLE ARE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO MAKE THAT LINK WHICH LINK INTO THEIR CAREER WITH AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM- THE PEACE RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE INTERNSHIP OVER IS OVER IS A BIG QUESTION- I'M- CHAIRING THE GOVERNOR HAS A TASK FORCE ON. DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT I'M CHAIRING THE SUB WORKGROUP ON DISABILITY WE'RE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THIS PROGRAM AS TO HOW IT CREATES A PATHWAY INTO CIVIL SERVICE TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. I'LL SOME RANTS DISABILITY VOICES UNITED I JUST WANT TO PICK UP ON A POINT THAT ERIN JUST MADE FROM THE STATE COUNCIL- I THINK WHAT WE ULTIMATELY WANT TO SEE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED OR PART OF THE LABOR FORCE. OVER THE LONG TERM. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT COMPETITIVE INTEGRATING PLAN IS ABOUT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN OTHER CONTEXTS- BUT NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE BUT- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS OF THE SIMILAR STRUCTURE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE INCENTIVES- TO HIRE PEOPLE KIND OF FOR. ME TO TURN ONE TO TWO YEAR PERIODS TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PARLAY INTO A YOU KNOW LONG TERM SORT OF- ATTACHMENT TO THE LABOR MARKET- SO I THINK THIS IS AGAIN ANOTHER CONTEXT IN WHICH WE NEED TO COLLECT DATA. LONGITUDINAL DATA SO WE CAN TRACK PEOPLE OVER TIME. OUR HOPE OF COURSE IS THAT THIS WILL BE THE SPRINGBOARD FOR LONG TERM YOU KNOW EMPLOYMENT. BUT WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW AS ERIN JUST MENTION SO I THINK AGAIN HERE WE NEED A GOOD. LONG TERM DATA ON INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS TO PROVE THE CONCEPT. SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT IT'S SERVING IT'S YOU KNOW LONG TERM INTENDED GOAL AND THEN AND THEN INCREASE THAT IF THAT'S WHAT IMPACT WE FIND. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT- I WILL JUST MAKE A COMMENT. IN FRESNO WE HAVE A KID'S CAFE WHICH IS OPERATED BY THE FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND THE INTERNSHIPS THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR THE ID DE COMMUNITY ARE TREMENDOUS AND- ARE WONDERFUL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO. BOTH GAIN SO FORTH CONFIDENCE AND ABILITY TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY AND- IT'S A WONDERFUL WAY FOR THEM TO- START TO SEE THEIR LIFE AFTER. EDUCATION AND SO. WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO- ASK THE DEPARTMENT AND DEAL LEFT TO HELP US TO PLEASE CONFIRM- THAT THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL IS COSTS NEUTRAL- IF YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH US IN THE ADVOCATES- HOPEFULLY BY. MARCH FOURTEENTH AND I WOULD SOON. THAT WOULD JUST BE HELPFUL IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. SURE WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ASKING IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO AND THE ATROCIOUS PRACTICE OF PAYING PATIENT WORKERS SO MINIMUM WAGE IN STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON INFORMATION PUT TOGETHER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS BUDGET ASK COINCIDES WITH SB TEN SIXTY TWO. THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT WHICH WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT CREATED STANDARDS AND PRACTICES FOR THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. THIS INCLUDES CREATING MET LIMITATIONS ON HOURS WORKED SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS WORKING CONDITIONS CHILD LABOR LAWS OVERTIME PAY IN MINIMUM WAGE. MINIMUM WAGE LAWS ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN EARN A STANDARD MINIMUM WAGE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. FOURTEEN C. WHICH IS AN EXCEPTION TO MINIMUM WAGE WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS EMPLOYERS TO BE ABLE TO PAY. EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. PORTERFIELD DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND CANYON SPRINGS COMMUNITY FACILITY USE FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES. PORTER BILL HAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CONSUMER WORKERS AND CANYON SPRINGS HAS FORTY NINE CONSUMER WORKERS ALL UNDER FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES MAKING SUB MINIMUM WAGE. THE JOBS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE INCLUDE WORK LIFE SKILLS GRAPHIC ARTS CULINARY WORK LANDSCAPE WORK JANITORIAL WORK. DELIVERING CLOTHING AND MOPPING. THESE CONSUMER WORKERS AT PORTER WILL. AT PORT OF RULES VOCATIONAL PROGRAM EARN BETWEEN A DOLLAR AND FIFTY EIGHT CENTS PER HOUR AND SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY SIX CENTS PER HOUR ON AVERAGE THEY EARN ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS PER HOUR. THE CONSUMER WORKERS AT CANYON SPRINGS VOCATIONAL PROGRAM EARN ABOUT A EARNED BETWEEN A DOLLAR AND FOUR CENTS PER HOUR AND SIX DOLLARS AND NINE CENTS PER HOUR. ON AVERAGE THEY EARNED THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY SIX CENTS PER HOUR. SEVERAL STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS TO ADDRESS A MINIMUM WAGE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON PASSED A BILL TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE CERTIFICATES BY STATE AGENCIES. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE ON PAR WITH STATE AND NATIONAL TRENDS THAT SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT FOR PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT PAY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SUB MINIMUM WAGES IN ITS STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. BY PROHIBITING SUB MINIMUM WAGE IN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CALIFORNIA WOULD SUPPORT A POLICY THAT PROVOKED PROVIDES A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAGE TO PERSONS FOUR PERF FOR WORK PERFORMED REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISABILITIES. CALIFORNIA WOULD ALSO PROVIDE DIGNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS CORD OF WHO ARE DEVELOPING SOCIAL SKILLS OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS LIFE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA YOU. WE'RE AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION AT THIS TIME HOWEVER HAVE WORKED WITH MISTER MISTER HARRIS TO UNDERSTAND THE METHODOLOGY TO COME UP WITH THE COST IMPLICATIONS I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE ANY VALUE WAITED IT FROM THE SENSE IF THERE WOULD BE ANY STATE OPERATIONS COSTS SO WE WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT TO FULLY VALIDATE THE COST. THANK YOU. YOU SENATE PARTICULARLY- AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL RAISES A BIGGER- ISSUE IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE ACROSS- THE ENTIRE DDS SYSTEM- AS MISTER HARRIS NOTED SEVERAL STATES HAVE BANNED THE USE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE OR PARTIALLY BANDIT BY PROHIBITING ITS USE FOR STATE AGENCIES SOME THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STATES THAT DON'T USE IT IN PRACTICE- AND THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO BAN SUB MINIMUM WAGE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- FOR CONTEXT. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY STILL USE A SUB MINIMUM WAGE AMONG- INDIVIDUALS WHO AE INCARCERATED HOWEVER THEY ALSO HAVE A PROJECT CALLED THE JOINT VENTURE- PROGRAM- WHICH MUST PAY A MINIMUM WAGE OR THE MARKET WAGE FOR THAT FOR WHATEVER WORK IS BEING DONE SO ULTIMATELY THIS COMES DOWN TO- SORT OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS BELIEFS OF THE MEMBERS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SUB MINIMUM WAGE IS- APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND IF THEY DO YOU WISH TO CHANGE WHAT CONSUMERS ARE PAID OUT PORTERFIELD DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IN CANYON SPRINGS COMMUNITY FACILITY. WE WOULD ALSO ASK WELL WHAT ABOUT THE- SHELTERED WORKSHOPS THAT ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY- IF THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY WENT DOWN THE PATH OF BANNING A SUB MINIMUM WAGE WORK FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE- LEGISLATURE ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO CAREFULLY. PLAN FOR HOW THIS TRANSITION WOULD TAKE PLACE SO THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ALL THE SUDDEN UNEMPLOYED OR ONLY YOU KNOW GETTING A JOB THAT MAKES MINIMUM WAGE BUT ONLY GETTING A COUPLE HOURS A WEEK- THERE SHOULD BE A TRANSITIONAL PHASE- THAT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY PLANNED. YOU WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHT. RATHER CITY COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- HAS ERIC HARRIS TESTIFIED THE RATES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL'S PAID VARIES FROM UNDER TWO DOLLARS TO UNDER SEVEN DOLLARS PER HOUR AND THAT. THAT RATE IS DETERMINED BY ACTUALLY MEASURING SOMEONE'S PRODUCTIVITY SO EVERYONE'S PAID MINIMUM WAGE INTO THIS ASSESSMENT CAN COME IN AND THEN BASED ON WHAT I AM AS A PERSON ABLE TO PRODUCE EACH HOUR MY RATES THAN. HEY ISN'T THAN LOWER DOWN- SO THERE'S LITERALLY A PROCESS OF DEVELOPING HUMANS THAT GOES INTO THIS PROCESS- I'LL SAY FOR MYSELF I HOPE NO ONE ACTUALLY MONITORS MY EVERY HOUR BECAUSE I'M NOT ALWAYS PRODUCTIVE- EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY BUT THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY. EMBRACES THE LEGISLATURE'S VIEWS THAT EVERY HUMAN SHOULD BE PAID THEIR VALUE THEY'RE WORTH FOR THEIR LABOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SIR. JORDAN'S WITH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA- WITHOUT SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PROPOSAL THERE'S COMMENTS MADE ABOUT THE LARGER ISSUE OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE AND SO I JUST WANTED EXPRESS YOUR CALIFORNIA'S POSITION WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED PROBABLY IN MORE THAN ANY OTHER FORM AT OUR NATIONAL LEVEL. WHICH IS THAT THEY ARE CALIFORNIA DOES SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF SOME MINIMUM WAGE IF THERE IS ADEQUATE TRANSITION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THAT PROGRAM RIGHT NOW TO SOMETHING ELSE AND WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY FAR FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT- WHICH HOPEFULLY SOME OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ALL DAY TODAY WOULD HELP TO DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. THANK. SORRY. IT MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ISSUE NINE BEEN GIVEN UPDATE ON OUR- PROGRESS TOWARDS HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THE AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL TIMELINE OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WERE PLANNING TO DO IS WE- MOVE TOWARDS MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICITY AND WHAT'S GOING ON SO CURRENTLY- PROVIDERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FOLKS THAT THEY SERVE OUR- COMPLETING OR ASSESSING THEIR OWN COMPLIANCE TOWARDS WHERE THERE WHERE THEY ARE AS IN RELATION TO THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. IT'S REALLY A AND M. AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP- TO GET A BASS LINE AND THEN DETERMINE THEN WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR EACH OF THOSE PROVIDERS AND THE FOLKS THAT THEY SERVE SO THOSE ASSESSMENTS AS WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO THERE BEING COMPLETED ONLINE IN A PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED IT'S A ONLINE SURVEY DEVELOPED BY A COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED A SURVEYS THE PROVIDERS DID A FEW YEARS AGO AS WELL- AND AGAIN THOSE SURVEYS NEED TO BE COMPLETED WITH INPUT FROM FOLKS WHO RECEIVE SERVICES ONE OF THE TENANTS OF THESE RULES AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA IS THAT. THESE ARE THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE REALLY ABOUT THAT THE OUTCOME AND EXPERIENCE OF FOLKS RECEIVE SERVICES IT. SAYS THAT. THERE INPUT AND- RESPONSE NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS WE MOVE FORWARD JUST GOING BACK TO THE SURVEY THAT FOLKS ARE COMPLY OR COMPLETING I DO NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE SURVEY- IN IN PARTICULAR WITH- EMAIL ADDRESSES AND MAKING SURE THOSE ARE UPDATED CORRECTLY. WILL WE HAVE ASKED FOR THE SURVEYS TO BE DONE- THE ASSESSMENTS TO BE DONE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. WILL MONITOR THAT AS WE GO ALONG- TO SEE IF THE TECHNICAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND IF WE NEED TO EXTEND THAT TIME FRAME- TODAY TOO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE WE DO HAVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED- SURVEYS THAT ARE COMPLETED OR NEAR COMPLETION OUT OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND THAT ARE REQUIRED. SO WE USE THESE RESULTS AS WE GET YOUR- LANGUAGE IN STATUTE TO VISIT. ENACTED THIS YEAR THE REQUIRES US TO REPORT ON. OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS MEANING THESE RICK DIVERT WIRE MINTS WILL USE THAT INITIAL REPORT- FOR THE APRIL FIRST POSTING. OF THE RESULTS OF THE SELF ASSESSMENTS AND THAT THAT'LL BE UPDATED AS WE GO GO ALONG. EITHER THE NEXT STEP- ONE OF THE NEXT STEPS IN AND- DETERMINING WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE GOING FORWARD IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE PROVIDERS THAT SO- COMPLETED THESE ASSESSMENTS THEY WILL DO AN ON SITE VISIT WITH THOSE. AND SO WE- JUST RECENTLY- A POSTED A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITH THEM PUBLIC CONSULTING GROUP THEIR CONTRACTOR THAT'S ALSO BEEN DOING SOME WORK WITH US- IN IN RELATION TO THE HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES RULES WITH SOME TRAINING- AND SO WE'RE- LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTRACTING WITH THEM TO DO SOME OF THIS ONSITE ASSESSMENT WORK. IT WILL BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AS WELL TO HELP INFORM WHAT THAT PROCESS TO LOOK LIKE BECAUSE AGAIN AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS WHO RECEIVE SERVICES ARE INVOLVED IN THE ASSESSMENT IN THE ON SITES AS WELL. YEAH THE OTHER THING THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPERATIVE IN A BIG PIECE OF HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND ALSO SELF DETERMINATION OF WILL TALK ABOUT NEXT AND REALLY THE ENTIRE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND SO- WE ALSO WILL BE STARTING SOME TRAINING THAT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED NOT ONLY FOR REGIONAL CENTERS BUT ALSO FOLKS WHO RECEIVE SERVICES AND PROVIDERS AS WELL ABOUT PERSON CENTERED THINKING PRACTICES AND THE LIKE AND HOW THAT NORMALLY AGAIN RELATES TO HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES BUT JUST- THE SERVICE SYSTEM AT LARGE. AND YOU KNOW JUST AS WELL WE ARE MOVING FOUR WE'VE LEARNED A LOT EVEN NOT JUST FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS BUT FROM THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN AVAILABLE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOR PROVIDERS TO ACCESS- TO MOVE TOWARDS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS. YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE TO MOST OFTEN THAT PROVIDERS HAVE HAD INDICATED WHERE THEIR- HAVING SOME STRUGGLES OR NEED SOME ASSISTANCE. IS THEN- PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND THEN ALSO BEING ABLE TO. DO SO- MAKE MORE INDIVIDUALIZED CHOICES AND FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY SERVE AND TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED THE FUNDING FOR IS TO ACCESS AND GET SOME TRAINING IN PERSON CENTERED THINKING- SOME PROVIDERS IS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES A RESOURCE TO OTHER PROVIDERS. TO HELP WORK WITH THINKING AND MAKE SOME CHANGES AS WELL- AND SO WITH THAT OF WILL LEAVE IT. THANK YOU SIR QUESTIONS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS MISTER KNIGHT ALLUDED TO A JUST NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALSO INCLUDES CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP PROVIDERS GET TO H. CBS COMPLIANCE THANK YOU CAN LIVE. UP PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NINE. CHIU MARK OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN THAT- WHAT WAS PUT IN THE AGENDA. I DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHAT THE FAMILIES NEED AN INDIVIDUAL SERVED SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT DOING OUTREACH TO PROVIDERS- AND REGIONAL CENTERS BUT- MOST FAMILIES HAVE NO IDEA THIS IS COMING. THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS TERM H. BUT CBS- THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MATERIALS PUT OUT. PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE NOW AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WERE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED WE HAVE KIDS AND HE'S REALLY SEGREGATED SETTINGS THAT MAY CLOSE DOWN OR THAT MAY HAVE TO DRAMATICALLY SHIFT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND WE HAVE NO IDEA THAT IN TWO YEARS FROM THIS MONTH THAT THINGS WILL HAVE TO HAVE CHANGED AND SO I JUST. REQUEST THAT DDS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT REALLY NOW PRIORITIZE FAMILY MEMBERS AND INDIVIDUALS SERVED TO GET THAT COMMUNICATION TEMAS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ERIC RATHER STICK COUNSELING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WANTED TO RISE TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND OUR OFFER TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE A PARTNER IN REACHING AT CBS COMPLIANCE. IT IS A IT IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE THERE'S A LOT TO WORK TO DO IN THE COUNCILS- INDEPENDENT AND REGIONAL PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CAN BE HELPFUL IN REACHING A DOING THESE ASSESSMENTS ADDITIONALLY NOTICE THE COMMENT FROM. THE STAFF COMMON AS IT RELATES TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE SPECIFIC CODES THAT COULD BE INCENTIVIZED OR PRIORITIZE- TO REACH H. B. AS COMPLAINTS FASTER WE HAVE A LIST WE THINK WITH THAT PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SING ONE MORE PUBLIC COMMENT IS COMING. I APOLOGIZE SHOULD BE NEARLY JORDAN'S WITHOUT TO CALIFORNIA JUST ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT- MISTER FRIDGES PLAN DOES HOPE TO INCENTIVIZE AS IN THE STAFF'S COMMENTS INCENTIVIZE TOWARDS EACH CBS COMPLAINT IN YOUR ONE IMMEDIATELY WITH THE FIRST YEAR IMPLEMENTATION IN YOUR TWO AND THREE- FOLLOWING WITH THE RATE STUDY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IF I MAY I WANTED TO START WITH THE DEPARTMENT SAYING NO FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- IF I COULD START WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ASK ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS OR- RED FLAGS THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT- H. C. B. S. COMPLIANCE. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL FUNDING WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS CONCERNED IN AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE LIKE I SAID WE'VE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THE ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. WHEN FOR THE FUNDING OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE THINK THAT THAT HAS LED TO A LOT OF PROGRESS- AND AS WE GO THROUGH THESE ASSESSMENTS NOW IT WOULD NOT ONLY THE SELF ASSESSMENT BUT ALSO THE ON SITE. THAT THAT'S GONNA HELP INFORM MORE. IF I CAN I- WOULD ECHO- TWO COMMENTS AGO AS WELL AND PUBLIC COMMENT. ABOUT THE NEXUS- AND I'M HOPING THAT. WE CAN TALK ABOUT- OR CONSIDER WHICH RATES. WOULD BE CANDIDATES FOR AN INCREASE THAT WOULD ALSO ASSIST WITH H. C. B. S. COMPLIANCE AND SO- OUR REQUEST WOULD BE IF THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE IT'S FEEDBACK ON THIS NEXUS QUESTION IN WRITING TO THE SUB COMMITTEE- AND THEN WOULD JUST ASK WHAT IS A REASONABLE DATE. HAVING TO DO THAT SO IF YOU JUST FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT A REASONABLE DATE IS WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND- MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN. I JUST WANNA OF. CAMANCHE. SO JUST GIVE A BRIEF UPDATE ON- SELF DETERMINATION AND ALSO THERE ARE A FEW QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA THAT I CAN ADDRESS- A FEW OF THOSE AND I KNOW THERE WAS ALSO REQUEST TO FOLLOW UP IN WRITING WHICH WE WILL DO AS WELL- SO. JUST AS JUST LAST YEAR IN NOVEMBER WE DID DO A SELECTION OF SOME ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS AND THE REASON WE DID THAT THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS SO WE CHOSE THERE WERE A NUMBER ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THOSE INITIAL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HAD CHOSEN NOT TO CONTINUOUS SELF DETERMINATION SO WE DID SELECT SOME ADDITIONAL FOLKS- TO CONTINUE. TO REPLACE THOSE FOLKS. AS OF MARCH SECOND SO JUST THIS MONDAY- WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY FOLKS THAT OF IT THAT HAVE ACTUALLY NOW STARTED WITH SELF DETERMINATION MOVING HAVE A BUDGET IN IRAQ AND- PURCHASING THEIR SERVICES- THROUGH THAT- SOME OTHER- THINGS TO NOTE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS HAS- BEEN A CONCERN. IS THE DELAY IN THE TIME BETWEEN THE SELECTION AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING STARTED. WHAT ONE OF THE ISSUES HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IS THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT MAY BE-NEEDED IN BETWEEN THE TIME TO REALLY GET STARTED. I MEAN IF WE THINK ABOUT IT WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE THAT IN SOME CASES IT'S ALMOST LIKE SETTING UP A BUSINESS FOR SOME FOLKS. NEED TO FIGURE OUT A HIGHER FOLKS WHO TO HIRE HOW MUCH TO PAY THEM HOW DO I USE ALL THIS MONEY- AND THAT'S JUST. A MAN. THE SMALL PART OF IT. RIGHT SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT- THE STATUE DID ALLOW FOR WAS TO USE SOME OF THE- THE SAVINGS THAT W- WE- REALIZED. BECAUSE OF THE FOLKS AROUND THE OLD PILOT PROJECT HAVE NOW MOVED INTO SELF DETERMINATION. SOME OF THAT FUNDING COULD BE USED TO HELP SUPPORT FOLKS IN THEIR TRANSITION AND HELP THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF SELF DETERMINATION TO THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. TO BE USED BY- WITH THE- COLLABORATION AND JUST DECIDING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS. ON HOW TO USE THAT FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT THAT IMPLEMENTATION IN TRANSITION. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP- SUPPORT FOLKS TO TRANSITION AND DO ALL THAT UP FRONT WORK THAT THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN BECAUSE IN. WE REALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND IS AGAIN THE FUNDING THAT WENT OUT IN THE GUIDANCE TO WIN OUT. STRESSES THAT THAT THE DECISION ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS NEED TO BE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES. BECAUSE IT'S- THE WORK OF THOSE CAN'T THE LOCAL COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE STATE RIGHT ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THE OVERSIGHT AND- PROGRESS IN THE PROGRAM. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AS I MENTIONED THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA AND I'LL GO THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE- INTO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE AS I MENTIONED IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY WHICH IS ABOUT 23% OVERALL. ONE THING THAT WE DID WHEN WE LOOKED AT THOSE FOLKS WHO CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE- BLACKS IN TO TAKE A STEP BACK WHEN WE DID THE INITIAL SELECTION OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS AS WELL AS THE- WHEN WE FILLED IN BEHIND WE WANTED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE NOT ONLY WHERE FOLKS LIVE BUT CERTAINLY- ALONG WITH- ETHNICITY AND RACIAL GROUPS. SO WHEN WE LOOK TO THE FOLKS WHO HAD CHOSEN NOT TO CONTINUE THE ETHNICITY AND RACIAL MAKE UP OF THAT GROUP THAT CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE ACTUALLY MIRRORS THE POPULATION AT LARGE SO WE DIDN'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCES ARE OUTSTANDING- YOU KNOW WARRANTED MORE IN ONE AREA THAN ANOTHER SO THAT THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT. IT WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER THERE CERTAINLY WAS A VARIANCE IN THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS WHO CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE ITS GET THE TO RANGE OF BETWEEN 11% OF THE FOLKS SELECTED UP 253% AND THERE'S SOME REASONS FOR SOME OF THAT SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IN THE- THE INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS THAT FOLKS WERE REQUIRED TO GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT SELF DETERMINATION BEFORE THEY- GOT ON THE LIST TO BE CONSIDERED FOR SELECTION. SOME OF THAT WAS DONE IN A IN A MUCH BROADER WAY- AND- IN SO SOME OF THE FOLKS AND THAT WERE SELECTED IN THOSE REGIONAL CENTERS- MAYBE WORKED AS QUOTE. THE MAYBE WEREN'T AS INTERESTED IN IN GOING FORWARD AT LEAST AT THIS TIME. IN SELF DETERMINATION AS MAYBE IN SOME OF THE OTHERS WHERE THERE IS MORE ROBUST- INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED AND FOLKS THAT THAT HAD MORE INFORMATION BUT WE ALSO THEN WANT TO LEARN THOUGH- ABOUT. WHY IT IS THAT THOSE FOLKS- CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE THEIR- AND SO WE DID SEND OUT A SURVEY THAT WAS HELPED- DEVELOPED BY- OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ADVISORY GROUP. WE SENT THAT OUT TO ALL FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOLKS. WHO CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE SO FAR WE'VE RECEIVED EIGHTY EIGHT RESPONSES BACK WE'RE OBVIOUSLY HOPING TO GET SOME MORE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEND THOSE OUT- AS- OTHER FOLKS- CHOOSE NOT TO CONTINUE AS WELL. AND WE pIF THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN- WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED IN CHOSEN NOT TO CONTINUE. IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN HELP MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE CAN LEARN. TO HELP- PROGRESS TO THE PROGRAM. ALSO ANOTHER COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND ABOUT PERSON CENTER PLANS AN OBVIOUS AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST ISSUE PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND THINKING IS OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THERE HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE GONE TO THAT PERSON CENTERED PLANNING PROCESS SO FAR AND AGAIN WE'LL KEEP- DATED AND BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA ON THAT MONTHLY IS BEING REPORTED BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEN ALSO WE CAN- VERIFY IN SOME CASES THAT SOME OF THOSE THAT THAT PERSON CENTERED PLANNING SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY PURCHASED- OUTSIDE OF. THE REGIONAL CENTER AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT- ONE AND MAKE SURE THIS OVERSIGHT AND THE PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL. WE ARE- LOOKING TO AND I THINK DIRECTOR BARS REMAIN- MENTION IT TO NOT ONLY IS THAT THERE A REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTE TO DO AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM. FOR ALSO GOING TO WITH THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS MAKE FOLKS WERE SELECTED AND SELF DETERMINATION AS A AS A AS A SUBSET IF YOU WILL OR- SO WE CAN JUST ANOTHER SET A AWAY IS ANOTHER MAJOR. AND IN LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BUMPS IF YOU WELL AND WHILE WE I THINK WE ALL KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY WORK WE'RE CREATING SOMETHING THAT'S NEW. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD PILOTS- WE THIS IS NEW STATEWIDE- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN AS A RESULT OF- THAT THAT. THE TIME THAT IT TOOK QUITE HONESTLY TO GET. THIS APPROVED FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT WAS NOT UNFORTUNATELY UNUSUAL. FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO GO AFTER AN APPLICATION FOR FUNDING WAS- PRESENTED TO THEM TO DO SOME APPROVALS THAT DID TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. FOR US TO DO THAT. AND THEN THERE WAS A DELAY- ACTUALLY AFTER WE DID OUR SELECTION. UNTIL WE ACTUALLY START WE'RE ABLE TO START THE ORIENTATION SO THAT FOLKS CAN GET STARTED- YOU KNOW IN HINDSIGHT. WE WEREN'T QUITE READY FOR THE ORIENTATIONS WHEN WE DID THE SELECTION AND I THINK THAT DID CREATE SOME. SOME SOME ANGST AMONGST FOLKS AND SO YOU KNOW. IF WE WERE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN WE WOULD DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY- AND- SO THERE'S ALSO. YOU KNOW INFORMATION I THINK IS BETTER ARE A REQUEST FOR THAT. IN A LOT OF THAT I THINK IS NOT ONLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK INFORMATION ON NOT ONLY WHEN. THINGS MAYBE ARE GOING RIGHT BUT ALSO LEARNING FROM FOLKS THAT WHAT'S WEIRD IS WORKING. AND SO WERE REALLY HELPFUL WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TWO IS TO CREATE SOME SHARED TRAINING AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN FOCUS GROUPS. TO SO THAT WE CAN ALL AS AS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT LEARN TOGETHER ON WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOTHING FURTHER ADMIXTURE THANK YOU- NEXT WE HAVE JUDY MARK. GAIL JUDY MARK PRESIDENT DISABILITY VOICES UNITED A STATEWIDE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DIRECTED EXCLUSIVELY BY INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS I'M ALSO PROFESSOR DISABILITY STUDIES AT UCLA BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M A PARENT OF JOSHUA A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WITH AUTISM WHO IS PROUDLY PART OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. SO TODAY WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THE MANY CONCERNS THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SYSTEM BUT I HAVE A SOLUTION FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE PROBLEMS AND THAT IS THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. WORRIED ABOUT OUTCOMES SELF DETERMINATION PARTICIPANTS GET TO CHOOSE THE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO THEM AND SELECT THE PEOPLE AND ACTIVITIES THAT HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEM RATES TOO LOW THERE ARE NO RATES IN SELF DETERMINATION YOU CAN PAY YOUR STAFF WHAT YOU DESERVE. DD SYSTEM COSTS RISING WILL BASED ON A TWENTY YEAR PILOT PROJECT OF SELF DETERMINATION FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS THE COSTS DO NOT RISE AS MUCH AS IN THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM BECAUSE OUTCOMES AND SATISFACTION ARE BETTER SERVICE COORDINATOR CASELOAD RATIOS TOO HIGH THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM ADDS ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM INDEPENDENT FACILITATORS. RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES NOT IMPROVING SELF DETERMINATION AS A WAY FOR FAMILIES TO CHOOSE CULTURALLY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY ACCESSIBLE SERVICE SO WHAT IS THIS MAGICAL PROGRAM CALLED SELF DETERMINATION. IT'S A LAW PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE SERVED BY REGIONAL CENTERS TO HAVE CHOICE AND CONTROL OVER THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVED BASED ON A PERSON CENTER PLAN IT IS THAT SIMPLE BUT WITH THIS GREAT PROMISE ONE WOULD THINK THAT EVERYONE IN THE DD SYSTEM WOULD JOIN TOGETHER TO WORK HARD TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM FORWARD. BUT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM HAS TAKEN LONGER TO IMPLEMENT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS SIX AND A HALF YEAR DELAY HAS TAKEN A TOLL ON THE ORIGINAL ENTHUSIASM AND MOMENTUM OF THE PROGRAM. IT IS LEAD TO VERY HIGH ATTRITION RATES MISINFORMATION FEAR AND DISCONTENT. THE PROGRAM IS BEING IMPLEMENTED INCONSISTENTLY IT REGIONAL CENTERS WELL SUMMER WORKING HARD TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL WE HEAR STORIES OF OTHERS DISCOURAGING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FROM PARTICIPATING AND SAYING IT'S NOT FOR YOU. SADLY WE HEAR THIS MORE FROM LATINO ASIAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO ALREADY FACE DISPARITIES. THE BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM ARE SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN DETAILED IN A REPORT SOON TO BE RELEASED BY THE STATE WIDE SELF DETERMINATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON WHICH I SET. THIS COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL COMMITTEES AT ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE TOP TEN BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION FROM OVERLY COMPLEX ORIENTATIONS TO POORLY TRAINED REGIONAL CENTER STAFF TO AN UNWILLINGNESS OF MANY PROFESSIONALS TO SHIFT THE PARADIGM. FROM THE EXPERTS KNOW BEST TO THE PERSON IS IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN LIFE. UNLESS THESE BARRIERS ARE ADDRESSED AND OVERSIGHT IS INCREASED WE WILL SEE PEOPLE LOSE THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW WE CAN TURN THIS AROUND AND MAKE THIS MAGICAL PROGRAM A SUCCESS. AND HELP IMPROVE THE WHOLE DO YOU SYSTEM WHILE WE'RE AT IT. BUT ONLY IF WE REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINES FOR REGIONAL CENTERS AND BETTER OVERSIGHT BY DDS WE HAVE APPRECIATED WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT WE ARE AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE NTDS MUST ENSURE. THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM IS REQUIRED SO THAT MY SON AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CAN ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU HELLO. SONNY PEDICLE A. O. M. WE WOULD JUST HAVE A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO ADD TO THE ONES THAT WERE- IN THE AGENDA IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOSTLY ADDRESSED- FIRST. WE ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE EVALUATION AND WHETHER THAT'S ON TRACK- TO GET FINISH ARE THEY DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION UP FRONT- TO DO A SUCCESSFUL OUT EVALUATION- SECONDS. THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM AS MISTER KNIGHT MENTIONED MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL DDS- PERSON SERVED AS OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WE'RE WONDERING IF THE DEPARTMENT FEELS THAT IT'S- READY ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE DELAYS AND CHALLENGES THAT HAVE. BEEN IDENTIFIED AND I GUESS THE A GREATER QUESTION MIGHT BE- ARE ANY MODIFICATIONS NEEDED IN IN THE STATUTE THAT WOULD HELP FACILITATE. THE RATE AT WHICH THE THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT. AND THEN- FINELY. OUR OFFICE WAS- pDEPARTMENT TO- PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COSTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. AND WHETHER. ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR WHETHER THERE BEEN ANY REQUESTS- TO INCREASE THE BUT THE INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS OVER THE INITIAL AMOUNT APPROVED THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS WRITTEN INTO STATUE TO BE BUDGET NEUTRAL INTEREST WONDERING HOW THOSE COSTS ARE PLAYING OUT OF THE COMING IN LOWER HIGHER. JUST THANK YOU WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN. WILL SEVERED COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS ONE OF THINGS I DO IS HELP PEOPLE GET INTO THE PROGRAM BY HELPING THE PERSON CENTER PLANS WHICH IS ACTUALLY EXPANDED TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BUDGET SHOULD BE THAT THEY'RE SORT OF FIND AND HOW TO GET THERE SPENDING PLAN IN PLACE. THAT GAP AS. AT THE DOLLARS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO AND THEN GET IT INTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN SO CAN ACTUALLY GET FUNDED TO BE RUN. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A HUGE THING I THINK RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE Y. WORKGROUP HAVE ARE PLAYING CATCH UP LIKE WE JUST NOW REVISING THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS% TO HELP MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THE SPENDING PLAN DOCTOR TO PEOPLE REALLY KNOW. HOW TO DO IT I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE SERVICE CODE HERE'S YOUR MIND WAS SPEND THE BILL ASK THEM TO DETAIL OUT IN VERY DETAILED THING WHAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON IT'S LIKE. IS MY BUDGET HERE'S WHERE I THINK I NEED TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT'S GOING TO PLAY THAT IS SLOWS THE WHOLE PROCESS DOWN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I'VE DNE. COMPLETED WHO ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE SPENDING PLAN IS QUITE A FEW TO GET APPROVED BECAUSE THAT'S AGAIN THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OF THIS WHICH IS I UNDERSTAND IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE'S NO FREE LUNCH WE HAVE TO REPORT ON IT BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THAT MUCH MORE STREAMLINED I THINK IT IS I AGREE WITH JUDY THAT IT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY FOR A LOT OF FOLKS REALLY YOU KNOW OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES TO WRITE SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND SO PHONE LIKE. THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THEY WANT THEIR NEEDS THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WE CAN'T DO THAT THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT HOW WE VENDORS SERVICES TO DO IT SO. IT HAS POTENTIAL BUT I AGREE HAS A LOT OF BARRIERS AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU SIR. HI KAREN CALL FROM REDONDO BEACH AND I APPLIED TO BE PART OF THE INITIAL PROGRAM AND DIDN'T GET PICKED AND A LOT OF FAMILIES WHERE I LIVE A VERY EXCITED AS WELL ABOUT BEING PART OF IT WHAT I SAID BEFORE ABOUT. HAVING SERVICES THAT WITH THE WRONG SERVICES AND I COULDN'T ACCESS THAT COULD ALL BE CHANGED BY SELF DETERMINATION I COULD DO USE THE MONEY AUTHORIZED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER THE SERVICES I DON'T. AND I CONTACT SAYS FOR SERVICES I DO NEED AND I CAN ACCESS AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER USE OF. THE MONEY THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MISTER CHAIR ANKARA THIS MISTAKE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS SELF DETERMINATION IS A CRITICAL VALUE FOR THE STATE COUNCILS IN OUR MISSION STATEMENT TO HELP INDIVIDUALS LEAD SELF DETERMINE LIVES THE STATURE GIVES THE STATE COUNCIL TO SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT ROLES FOR THIS PROGRAM ONE IS THE EVALUATION WHICH LA- SPEAK SPOKE ABOUT. THE OTHER IS COVENING IN SHARING THE STATEWIDE SELF DETERMINATION OF VISOR COMMITTEE- WHICH THAT A DUTY MARK SPOKE ABOUT REGARDING EVALUATION THERE IS A DUE DATE FOR US TO DELIVER TO THE LEGISLATURE A REPORT. ON ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THE SATISFACTION OF PARTICIPANTS- IN THE NEW PROGRAM VERSUS THE PRIOR PROGRAM THAT'S DUE JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT'S A VERY SHORT TIME FROM NOW WHEN WE ONLY HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE- IN THE PROGRAM SO THAT SOMETHING A TO CONSIDER THAT THAT THE DEADLINE ON THAT pSTATEWIDE SELF DETERMINATION VISOR COMMITTEE. THEY HAVE THEY ARE WORKING ON AND VERY CLOSE TO DELIVERING PRODUCING A DOCUMENT IDENTIFYING THE TEN TOP BARRIERS- FOR THIS PROGRAM IT RANGES FROM- DELAYS OF GETTING THE PROGRAM OUT LACK OF STANDARD TRAINING REGIONAL CENTERS. KIND OF A LACK OF EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS WE'RE GONNA BE SCRAMBLING TO FIND WHO'S GONNA BE MY INDEPENDENT FACILITATOR WHO WILL BE MY FMS WHO WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES SO BE RECREATING THE SYSTEM. AS WE ROLLED OUT- ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES IS A SLOW CHANGE OF POINT OF VIEW- BECAUSE OF THE TERMINATORS A COMPLETE DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO RECEIVE SERVICES. I'M MORE IMPORTANT IN LAYING OUT TEN BARRIERS THIS DOCUMENT LAYS OUT SOLUTIONS OF RECOMMENDATIONS- SO THAT'S THAT'S I'M READY WILL PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS TO THE MINISTRATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD EVENING AMY WESTLING ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR HEARING THIS CONCERN IN HEARING THE ISSUES AROUND THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE EX EXCITED AS ANYBODY ELSE TO SEE THIS WORK. AND THE STAFF AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THIS. OUR STAFF THAT ARE DEDICATED AND THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERED AT MOST CENTERS TO BE PART OF THIS EXCITING PROJECT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT ARE SOME CREATIVE IDEAS THAT FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS SERVED IN THE SYSTEM CAN BRING TO US. THAT WE CAN PERHAPS WRAP INTO THE BIGGER SYSTEM AS WELL. BUT AS BOTH MISTER PRATHER'S MR SANFORD NOTED. THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND A LOT OF THEM COME FROM THE COMPLEXITY OF GETTING MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS EVERYBODY ELSE BY THAT COMPLEXITY- AND IF. YOU KNOW HE IF THERE WERE AN EASY WAY TO DO IT WE WOULD LOVE TO FIND IT. PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS WITH CALCULATING EACH PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL BUDGET THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE TO SPEND. THERE IS A VERY EASY WAY TO DO IT LOOK AT WHAT WE SPENT LAST YEAR AND CALL IT A DAY BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE- SYSTEM WAS SET UP BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS INTENDED. TO CORRECT SOME ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM RELATED TO SERVICE ACCESS RELATED TO UNMET NEEDS. AND RELATED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH THE FULL OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS AN ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. AND THAT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A SHORT CUT AROUND IT- IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE WAS A BUTTON WE COULD PUSH IN A NUMBER WOULD POP OUT BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S ALL INDIVIDUALLY BASED AND IT'S TIME CONSUMING AND I. APPRECIATE THAT IT'S SLOW AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE AMAZING OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'LL ALL HAVE BEEN WORTH IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES STARK CONTRAST GRANDMOTHER AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM FOR ME AS A GRANDMOTHER IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

CAN ASSIST RUSSIA JUST WANTED TO SAY IN. JUST SICK OF MY FRIEND IF YOU WALK INTO HER LITTLE HOME HER HOME LOOKS LIKE THE SCHOOL LITERALLY. POSTERS BULLETIN BOARDS EVERYTHING. YES OUR SYSTEM NOT. ALISON RANTS TVO. WOW. I THINK THE PREVIOUS COMMENT REALLY- IT PICKED UP ON A REALITY THAT NOBODY'S REALLY EXPLICITLY MENTIONS- I WISH THAT THE EARLIER COMMENT OF AS OF ANY WESTLING FOR ARCA I WISH HER ATTITUDE WAS UNIVERSALLY SHARED AMONG REGIONAL CENTERS- SADLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REALITY- SOME REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN QUITE SUPPORTIVE ABSOLUTELY MIND FOR EXAMPLE- BUT NOT ALL HAVE- AND SO PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT EQUALLY POSITION AND I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE CAN THAT'S COME OUT SOME OF OUR TESTIMONY SO I THINK. IF WE'RE STRIVING FOR UNIFORM SYSTEM WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY AS LONG AS WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ALREADY ABOUT OUTCOMES MEASURING OUTCOMES- I THINK SELF DETERMINATION IS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR AN OUTCOME MEASURE. NOW OF COURSE THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED WE CAN HAVE THE OUTCOME BE HOW MANY PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GO INTO SELF DID IT RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S AN OUTCOME MEASURES THE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE- ILLUSTRATIVE OR REGULATORY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ROLE IN. MAXIMIZING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SELF DETERMINATION BUT THERE'S CONSIDERABLE VARIATION ALONG THAT DIMENSION ACROSS THE STATE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I THINK WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AGAIN HOW TO MEASURE IT AND HOW TO INCENTIVIZE IT. SO THAT WE REALLY EQUALIZE OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST IN CERTAIN REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE SUB COMMITTEE. I WAS ALSO QUITE MOVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE MOTHER AND YOU CAN ALWAYS. TELL WHEN SONS ARE LUCKY TO HAVE ADVOCATES WHO ARE MOTHERS AS WELL WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR KIDS SOME JUST WANTED TO COMMENT IF I COULD REGARDING WHAT THE LA BROUGHT UP AND WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY MODIFICATIONS. THAT WERE NEEDED IN THE STATUTE- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HELP TO ASSIST- MORE PEOPLE ENTERING INTO SELF DETERMINATION. M. CERTAINLY WE HEARD THE QUESTIONS FROM THE LA ON WILL WORK AND CAN GET SOME RESPONSES FOR YOU ON THOSE- ALONG WITH THAT JUST THE STATUS OF THE EVALUATION WHEN IT'S COMING OUT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE REPORT- THAT YOU MENTIONED AND WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE SURE THE TIMELINE WORKS- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE SLOW IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND- JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT HELPS US TO DEAL WITH DISPARITIES AS WELL. AND SO WE JUST ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP TO FACILITATE THIS AS WE GO FORWARD SOME. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN. THANK YOU. THE ISSUE 11-3- GUARDIAN ARE- REORGANIZATION AN UPDATE AND THE AGENDA CORRECTLY NOTES- THE- OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE- A REORGANIZATION OF HEADQUARTERS- SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY AND- WITH THE NEXT ISSUE- WAS REALLY PART OF THE DRIVERS YOU KNOW WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. AND WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED AT THE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND THEN HOW DO WE HELP YOU KNOW WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO AFFECT CHANGES AND TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THEM THE SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE RESPONSIVE AND THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO GET OUT TO THEM IN A TIMELY WAY TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM DO. THAT INITIATIVES IN THE WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO WHETHER IT WAS SELF DETERMINATION WITH THE COMMITTEE PLACEMENT PLANS WITH THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THAT IT THEY SUBMIT TO US AND RATE REACT TO IT SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE ARE- VERY FAR ALONG AND ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR REORGANIZATION OF THE POSITIONS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAVE- HIRED EVERYBODY THAT WAS IDENTIFIED TO WORK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE REORGANIZATION- AND- WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH- DEVELOPING THE DIFFERENT TO- STRUCTURE WITHIN- THE REGIONAL CENTER- SYSTEM BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND SOME OF THE OTHER- DEPARTMENTS. OR ARE DIVISIONS AND OUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL- BUT MISTER WINFIELD THE- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR IS HERE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU I'M SOME EXAMPLES OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE BENEFITS OF SOME THE RE ORGANIZATION AND- THAT THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED AS A BENEFIT. THANK YOU SO- AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN INDICATED WE ARE- PRETTY FAR ALONG IN THAT THE REORGANIZATION AND SO WE'VE- DEVELOPED OUR LIAISON TEAMS FOR THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. AND MOST OF THE STAFF OF BEEN HIRED FOR THOSE LIAISON TEAMSTERS THREE STAFF FOR EVERY THREE REGIONAL CENTERS- WE HAVE THAT BEGAN MEETING WITH EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO. INTRODUCE THE NEW STAFF AND MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEY'RE- EXECUTIVE STAFF FOR OTHER TEAM MEMBERS. WE HAVE ALSO- BEEN MUCH MORE INVOLVED WITH A REGIONAL CENTERS IN THEIR COMMUNITY MEDIAN SO IN THE PAST WE WOULD GO TO- BOARD MEETINGS EVERY QUARTER WAS SORT OF OUR STANDARD UNLESS A REGIONAL CENTER. WAS REALLY STRUGGLING AND THEN WE WOULD GO TO EVERY BOARD MEETING. THAT WE NOW ARE ATTENDING EVERY BOARD MEETING OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. AND MAKING OUR PRESENCE MORE KNOWN SAID THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS KNOW. AND I RECOGNIZE MORE SO WHO THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT WE HOLD THEIR CONTRACT AND THAT WE ARE RESOURCE TO THOSE THOSE BOARD MEMBERS- WE'VE ALSO- INCREASED. OUR RESPONSE TIMES HAVE DECREASED SO THAT WITH COMPLAINTS AND WITH ISSUES THAT COME UP WE FOUND THAT WITH THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IT'S BEEN MUCH MORE MUCH EASIER TO RESPOND MORE TIMELY TO THE PUBLIC- WE ARE ALSO ATTENDING OTHER REGIONAL CENTER PUBLIC MEETINGS SUCH TO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE PURCHASE OF SERVICE- DISPARITY MEETINGS- THEY'RE HAVING MEETINGS ON PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PUBLIC MEETINGS WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE STAFF THERE AND- AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WAYS THAT WE- BECAUSE WE OBTAIN INPUT FROM HAVE FAMILIES AT THE OUTSET OF ALL OF THIS. AND HEARD FROM THEM WHAT WAS SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS WERE FOR THE REORGANIZATION WERE TRYING REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE. THAT FAMILIES AND CONSUMER OUR FIND US TO EXCESS. AND THAT WE ARE MORE AVAILABLE TO HELP REGIONAL CENTERS- IN TERMS OF THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THERE THERE'S THERE DAILY WORK. DEPARTMENT OF NUMBER. AND IF I COULD I APOLOGIZE TO JUST GO AHEAD AND ADD- ONE- NOTE IN CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA IS THE GOVERNOR'S- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS A REQUEST FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUN ONE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND- FOR- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. OF NEW LEASE SPACE AND SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE SOUTHERN CALIFONIA OFFICE THAT IS HOUSED OVER AT FAIRVIEW AT THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AND SO THIS WOULD. THEN BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR CLOSURE AND- HAVE OFFICE SPACE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE SPACE FOR THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE AGENDA OUTLINE SOME OF THE POSITIONS AND- AND RECONCILES TO OUR REQUEST. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I NOTHING FURTHER TED IT'S TIME THANK YOU HELLO WE HAVE REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SET THE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE NEW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICE IN THE BACK UP WHICH WE RECEIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND RECOMMEND APPROVAL THANK YOU- PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON A FEW OF THE ITEMS DECREASED RESPONSE TIMES. ATTENDING MEETINGS MAKING YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN- I THINK OUR QUESTION WOULD BE HOW WAS QUALITY OF SERVICE BEING MADE STRONGER WITH THESE INVESTMENTS AND- FURTHER CONVERSATIONS IN WAY YOU CAN HELP WOULD STRENGTHEN THAT SO- WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ELEVEN OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE TWELVE. THANK. THANK YOU- SO I AM I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE A IT- UPDATE IN AN OVERVIEW OF THE OVERSIGHT ITEM FOR DISPARITIES FUNDING AND- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF MY STAFF THAT IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING SOME OF THE MEASURES- THAT WE- HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN- USED TO- DO THE TRACKING OF THE OUTCOMES OF OUR DISPARITY FUNDS- I WOULD- SWITCH SEATS WITH DOCTOR LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT I DO WANT TO JUST SPEAK TO SOME OF IMPORTANT ITEMS THAT. WHISPERED I DON'T MIND WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST- I'D SAY THE LAST FOUR YEARS- BUT CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED IT EARLIER IN REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN FINDING BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE WHITE COMMUNITY AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE DATA ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT IS NOT ONLY WITH THE WORK THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT AND DOING IT AND THAT I YOU WAITING THAT PURCHASE SERVICE DATA OF AND WE'VE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE DATE THAT THE REASON CENTERS ARE USED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. GOOD WERE USING STATE LAW THAT WE ABLE TO STAND UP BUT ALSO AN OPEN THAT WE PANTS THAT ARE CAME ALSO UNDERSTANDS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ALSO DOING IN A M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; SENT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> WITH OF OUR THERE'S A WAS SOME PLACE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IS TO SAY HOW CAN BE SURE THAT NOT ONLY IS THAT ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEIR MACHINE READABLE FORMAT BUT HOW IS IT EASILY. AND SO CAN WITH THE TO SEE THAT WOULD WANT TO DO A MAY SURE EACH WERE ON SAID IN STATE THAT THE PER A SURVEY DAY IT IS IT GOING BE JUST HEARING OTHERS THAT WILL IN. WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND IT WENT TO REGIONAL CENTER- OPERATIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT OR TO DELIVER DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES TO IT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WE PIVOTED OVER TO A GRANT PROGRAM THE SECOND YEAR AND THAT GRANT PROGRAM ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE TO- DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT WAS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO- INTRODUCE NEW IDEAS DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND START EXPANDING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES THAT COULD REALLY BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS AND HELP FAMILIES NAVIGATE SERVICES. SO IN DOING THAT WE STARTED SEEING MUCH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT- HAD BEEN REPLICATED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT WAS THE INTEREST OF EITHER THE NAVIGATORS OUR PROMO TORAS TO BE- HELPING FAMILIES- NAVIGATE THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEMS SO WE'RE IN A PLACE- WHEN WE STARTED WE USED- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA- THAT GAVE US MEASURES THAT WE HAVE- MEASURES THAT WE'VE POSTED- FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW THAT WE ARE USED AND THEN I JUST WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN THE FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO START IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE OUTCOMES- THAT WERE SEEN AND OUR OUR DATA SO AND I KNOW- THE GENDER OF REFLECTS THE DISABILITY VOICES A UNITE THE AGGREGATE DATA- RECOGNIZING THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE MEASURE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ON THE AGGREGATE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ON THE AGGREGATE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND THERE WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DIFFERENT CULTURES MAY NOT USE- RESIDENTIAL SERVICES SO WE REALLY WANTED TO DO DRILL INTO SOME OF THE MORE. KIND OF SERVICE BASED- EXAMPLE SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE BARRIERS WHAT'S OCCURRING AND HOW DO WE EFFECT CHANGE IN UNDERSTANDING THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE A POSTED YET ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS TO WORK WITH THIS NEWLY FORMED DISPARITY WORK GROUP THAT WE HAVE. IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF THE INFORMATION- WE'RE FINDING WITH THE- THE- THE EQUITY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE A LEVIN MEASURES- THAT HAVE MULTIPLE PULP POPULATIONS ETHNICITIES IF YOU WILL. THERE'S A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE I'M INDIVIDUAL POPULATION MEASURES THAT INCLUDES WHETHER IT'S DIAGNOSIS OR OR ETHNICITIES- BASED ON THOSE MEASURES WE HAD EIGHT IMPROVED- AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THOSE MEASURES AS A COMPARISON FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAVE TEN THAT SHOW- SHOWED NO OR SLIGHT CHANGES. AND THEN WE HAVE THREE THAT SHOWED LARGER GAPS. AND SO WHAT THIS DOES FOR US IS WERE ABLE TO NOW TAKE A LOOK INTO SOME OF THOSE AREAS OF ONE OF THE AREAS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BY. IS THAT WE HAVE A SERVICE CODE THAT'S CALLED ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE AVERAGE COST OF ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING. WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT TE SERVICES EXACTLY USED FOR WE'RE GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO THIS BUT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT'S USED. IS FOR A. B. A. OR BEHAVIOR TRAINING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AUTISM OR OR HIGH INTENSITY NEEDS. THIS IS A PARTICULAR AREA IN A MEASURE. THAT ACTUALLY THE WAS THE MOST MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE THAT ACTUALLY GOT WORSE BETWEEN OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WHITE. PER CAPITA SPEND AND THEN THIS BI ONYX VERSUS WHITES PER CAPITA SPEND. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TODAY AS TO WHY THAT IS. BUT I I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF GLAD THAT WE KNOW THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE SOME SOME ASSUMPTIONS BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO DRILL INTO A BY REGIONAL CENTER TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND SEE WHAT MAY BE THOSE DRIVERS. IS IT THAT WE HAVE. SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS GENERIC RESOURCES AND REGIONAL CENTERS MAY NOT BE FUNDING SOME OF THE A BA SERVICES UNTIL THEY GET THOSE RESOURCES. AND IS THAT IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MORE THAN IT IS OUR WHITE COMMUNITIES SO. AGAIN I'M I'M- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO THOSE THINGS. SO AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR EFFORTS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT- AREAS IS REALLY DRILLING INTO THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. I DO JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF NOTES TO SOME OTHER INITIATIVE BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO. IS MAKE SURE THAT ANY INITIATIVE OR POLICY THAT WERE LOOKING THROUGH IT THROUGH THE LENS OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE. WE WORK WITH GEORGETOWN WE- CALIFORNIA WAS SELECTED AS ONE OF THE STATE'S TO WORK WITH GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. AND WE WORK WITH THE YOU SAID SINCE STATE COUNCIL AND D. R. C. YOU KNOW TO SAY HOW DO WE KIND OF BUILD OUR LEADERSHIP. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. I DO KNOW THAT PART OF WORKING WITH THE DS TASK FORCE AND THE WORK GROUPS AND TRYING TO BRING FORWARD APPLICATIONS THAT REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITY. I HAVE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTED ON THE TASK FORCE. SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IS THAT WHAT ARE THOSE INITIATIVES THAT WE CAN START DEVELOPING THE SELF ADVOCATES IN THE- THE- DIFFERENT COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT WILL PARTICIPATE SO WE CAN'T HAVE A BROADER pTHAN IT WAS. BUT IT'S NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT- GAPS IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE VOICES THAT ARE AT THE TABLE AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT WERE. I'M GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING. THE REORGANIZATION IS AN AREA THAT HELPS US SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS YEAR'S ATTEND- ALL OF THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT REGIONAL CENTERS HAD. IN THEIR COMMUNITY ON THE PURCHASE A SERVICE THERE SEVENTY FIVE DIFFERENT MEETINGS WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE STAFF SO NOW IS WE'RE KINDA LINKING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. WERE WERE THERE TO LISTEN TO THAT DIALOGUE IN THAT CONVERSATION. TALKED ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION TAKING A LOOK AT THE DATA SO WE CAN HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AND- AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S USER FRIENDLY. I WILL JUST MAKE- LAST NOTE IS THAT ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS AGAIN AS ISAID AS WERE PUTTING FORWARD- PROPOSALS ARE INITIATIVES WE DO LOOK AT HOW DOES THIS IMPACT. OUR COMMUNITY AND REALLY ADDRESS THOSE. REALLY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AS TO DISPARITY AND BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO SERVICES. THE ENHANCE- CASELOAD FOR THREE FOUR AND FIVE I HAD MENTIONED THAT IN THE EARLIER ISSUE. THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM YOU KNOW LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN USE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF- THE INEQUITY OR THE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO SERVICES- AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE CROSS SYSTEM COLLABORATION. YOU KNOW WORKING WITH OUR OTHER SYSTEMS SO AS WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUR FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO ACCESS. THAT WE'RE DOING IN A WAY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO. ADDRESS ISSUES BROADLY. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE THINGS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU- FERNANDO GOMEZ FROM DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING TO AND I'M SHAKING MY HEAD AS I HEAR REPORT BECAUSE I THINK OUR SECRET WEAPON IS IN THE PARENTS LIKE THE TWO THAT YOU SEE THAT THAT'S WHAT I THINK OUR SOLUTION IS BUT THE MY NAME IS FERNANDO GOMES I AM THE FATHER OF US GOT ANTONIO WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. AND HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF DOWN SYNDROME AND I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY FORCES UNITED. THEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE SIGNIFICANT SERVICES THE DISPARITIES THAT LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ASIAN SPACE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND REGIONAL CENTERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TO READ KATE THESE DISPARITIES. LAST YEAR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED ISSUED REPORTS SHOWING THAT DESPITE THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SPENT DISPARITIES FOR LATINOS ACTUALLY HAD INCREASED IN TWENTY OUT OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS WELL NOW AFTER THREE YEARS. IN THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS DISPARITIES FOR LATINOS HAVE INCREASED IN NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY STATE THE SAME INTO A THE TO REGIONAL CENTERS. EVEN THE LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST GROUP SERVED BY THE SYSTEM. THEY CONTINUE TO FACE THE GREATEST LEVEL OF DISPARITIES. AT ALMOST EVERY REGIONAL CENTER LATINOS RECEIVE NO MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WHITES GET. AT FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS LATINOS ONLY RECEIVE A THIRD. OF WHAT WHITES RECEIVE AND THINGS SEEM TO BE WORSE AT REGIONAL CENTERS WHERE THE LATINO POPULATION IS THE LARGEST. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE DIRECTOR BARGE BEEN HAS MADE THIS ISSUE SUCH A PRIORITY AND HAS ENGAGE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH DEEP INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. TO BRING TO THE TABLE A VOICE THAT HAS BEEN SILENT. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO FIND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK WITH AND TRAIN FAMILIES BY MEETING THEM WHERE THEY'RE APT. AND HELPING THEM INTEGRATE INTO A SYSTEM ON THE PEER TO PEER BASIS. SO WHY HAVE WE NOT SEEN THE BETTER RESULTS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE FUNDED PROGRAMS TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY AFFECT. WE NEED TO STOP ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR PROGRAMS THAT REALLY DON'T WORK. AND REPLICATE THOSE THAT ACTUALLY DO. THE PRIORITY NOW NEEDS TO BE ON THE ROAD CASA DISPARITIES WE ARE SEEING THAT THE ROADBLOCKS MOSTLY HAPPEN WHEN THESE GROUPS GRASSROOTS EFFORTS. ENGAGE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. WHEN A COMMUNITY GROUP IS A SYSTEM A FAMILY TO GET THE PROPER SERVICE AS THEY OFTEN EXPERIENCE RESISTANCE. AT THE POINT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. MANY OF MY COMMUNITY CONTINUE REPORT FEELING INTIMIDATED BY THE SYSTEM AND ARE SOMETIMES AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN FEAR OF RETALIATION AGAINST THEIR CHILD. YOU MAY HEAR SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES AND ACTUALLY HAVE DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS TODAY. WE NEED TO SEE THE CULTURAL CHANGE AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL. WE NEED TO STOP DENYING THAT THE REAL BY OF SUCCESS. WE NEED TO STOP ATTRIBUTING DISPARITIES TO THE ETHNIC CULTURE A FAMILIES THE LACK OF EDUCATION OR THE PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. WE NEED TO MOVE FROM IT REGIONAL CENTERS CULTURE OF NO. AND PASSING THE BUCK TO A CULTURE OF EMPATHY ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT. THE REGIONAL CENTERS NEED TO MEET FAMILIES RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE ACT. THE WAY TO CHANGE A CULTURE OF NO IS BY ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY DISPARITIES TO ACTUALLY BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE WILL GAS AT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE PRODUCING THE BEST RESULTS ARE THOSE LED BY INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES OF DISPARITY. SO WE ALSO REQUEST THE DDS CREATE A DISPARITY OMBUDSMAN THAT FAMILIES CAN CALL DIRECTLY WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND CAN INTERVIEW INTERVENE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER ON THEIR BEHALF. WE REQUESTED AN OVERSIGHT BODY WITH SOME AUTHORITY BE MADE UP OF FAMILY MEMBERS. INDIVIDUALS FACING DISPARITIES REGIONAL CENTER STAFF AND ADVOCATES WHO CAN FIND COMMON GROUND AND CONTRIBUTE TO MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE. TOWARDS LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR HELLO. CINEMATIC LA- WE JUST HAD A COUPLE COMMENTS ON AND THIS- ISSUE ONE- IS TO SAY THAT GOING BACK TO OUR- CONVERSATION MUCH EARLIER IN THE DAY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT THIS. THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO GO FOR THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SHOULD RESTRUCTURED TO TEST INCENTIVES TO USE TO ACTUALLY REWARD REGIONAL CENTERS FOR CLOSING SOME OF THOSE DISPARITY GAPS- SAID JUST AN IDEA- AND THEN- OUR OTHER COMMENT WOULD REFLECT SOMETHING THAT MISTER GOMEZ SAID WHICH IS JUST THE NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH PER PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL. AND THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT- EVALUATION AS WELL AS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITY. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWELVE. ALISON RANSOM I AM A MEMBER OF BOARD MEMBER DAVE YOU BUT I WILL SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE SAID LIVE ACTUALLY BECAUSE I ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER I THINK THAT INDEPENDENT EVALUATION REALLY GOES HAND IN HAND WITH A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLANS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH ABOUT TAKING AN OUTCOMES BASED IN DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO. DEVELOPING AN EVIDENCE BASE ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK AND THEN USING THAT AS A SPRINGBOARD FROM WHICH TO BUILD ON SUCCESS AND ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT WE I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THE DISPARITIES OF EVERY KIND IN THE SYSTEM ARE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THERE EVEN A MORE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM NOW THAN THEY WERE WHEN WE STARTED TO ADDRESS THEM THREE FOUR YEARS AGO- BUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY A CASE IN POINT FOR WHY WE NEED TO SHIFT THE MENTALITY TO REALLY AGAIN COLLECTING SYSTEMATICALLY DATA THAT CAN BE TRACKED TO DATA THAT IS RELIABLE. DATA THIS TRANSPARENT DATE IS IT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE SYSTEM. ABOUT MEASURING IT IN SUCH A WAY THEY CAN FIGURE OUT IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND SO I THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION PIECE WAS NOT BAKED INTO THE PERFORMANCE AND SENATE BUT SORRY WAS CUT BAKED INTO THE DISPARITIES GRANTS AT THE OUTSET- MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. AND I'VE MENTIONED THIS BEFORE I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO BE A LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION- I THINK THERE AGAIN THAT WE HAVE A WEALTH OF YOU KNOW OF. PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE IT'S VERY IT'S VERY LATE OF ALL. AND I THINK PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE INTERESTED IN STUDYING THIS ISSUE IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND IT'S REALLY SAD THING TO ME THAT AFTER THE APPROPRIATIONS I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY TO FORTY FOUR MILLION- THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN WE DID FOUR YEARS AGO- I THINK THAT ELLIE- SUGGESTION ABOUT THE IDEA OF KIND OF SEEING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERT IT INTO A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN IN WHICH YOU INCENTIVIZE REGIONAL CENTERS. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE BUT I RESPECTFULLY DON'T AGREE AND THAT'S BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE FOR UNDERGO MRS TESTIMONY. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PIONEERING THESE PROGRAMS COME FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING MOST AFFECTED. THAT ARE BEING UNDERSERVED IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- BUT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE COUPLED AS HE EXPRESSED SO WELL IN HIS TESTIMONY. WITH A AGAIN WITH INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT EVERY PROGRAM YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT IS A LEAD. YOU KNOW I'M SURE WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BY INDIVIDUALS FROM COMMITTEES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED IS NECESSARILY SUCCESSFUL ONE OR SUCCESSFUL AS IT COULD BE. SO I THINK REALLY THAT THIS JUST REALLY MAKES THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTER THIS EXPENDITURE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE SHOULD HAVE A RICH EVIDENCE SPACE. AND I ALSO WANT TO PICK UP VERY BRIEFLY ON. ON A DIRECTOR PARCHMENTS POINT IT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO SEE AN EFFECT ON THE OVERALL YOU KNOW POS DISPARITIES. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY METRIC WE HAVE WITHOUT DEFINING AT THE OUTSET WHAT THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF A PILOT IS. SOME PILOTS MAY HAVE A MUCH MORE DISCRETE GOAL OF SERVING PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES WE WOULD NECESSARILY EXPECT THEM TO INCLUDE TWO AT IF AFFECT THE AGGREGATE NUMBERS. RIGHT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT METRIC I THINK YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP THE METRIC. IN CONSIDERATION OF WHAT THE PARTICULAR PILOT IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE AGAIN ANOTHER FACET THE ONE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A BILL TO CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH SO FAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DOOR CONTRAIRE US AND I'D FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT MR GOMEZ SAID. WHEN HE SPOKE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM PART OF A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION CALL THE ICC. INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE AND OUR ASSIGNMENT THANKS TO. THE SUPPORT OF A DIRECTOR PARCHMENT. WAS TO LOOK FOR DISPARITIES IN OUR PARTICULAR. LATINO COMMUNITY. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE EDUCATED FAMILIES ABOUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND IT WAS QUITE ASTOUNDING TO FIND. THAT MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. HAD NO IDEA. OF WHAT TO DO. EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE COORDINATOR COMING. EVERY YEAR TO MEET WITH THEM. WE ATTENDED I A P. MEETINGS WE'VE GONE TO FAIR HEARINGS WITH FAMILIES AS WELL AS- HELP THEM THROUGH. THE SYSTEM TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION OF HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR NEEDS. AT FIRST WHEN WE ENTERED OUR PARTICULAR OUR PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTER WE WERE KIND OF SEEN AS THE ENEMY. ARE AT AYE PP MEETINGS SO- WE WERE SAID THAT TO BE AGGRESSIVE. ARE WE WERE SAID IT WAS SAID THAT OUR FAMILIES HAD CHANGED THAT THEY USE THAT THE BUT FAMILIES SO THAT WE TOOK INTO THESE MEETINGS HAD CHANGED THAT THEY WERE NICE AT ONE POINT AND NOW THEY WERE. VERY NICE. SO THE PROCESS IN THE SERVICES IN THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY HAS. ABOUT THE OUR REGIONAL CENTER IT IT'S A COMPLEX SYSTEM FOR ANYONE AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A MOM AT HOME WITH TO US TO STICK CHILDREN WITHOUT EVEN RESPITE THEN YOU CAN FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOME OF THESE- FAMILIES. WE ARE TAKING UP TO FIVE FAMILIES TO FAIR HEARINGS ARE ACTUALLY NOT. BECAUSE THEY WERE DENIED SERVICES WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO THROUGH THE APPEAL PROCESS MANY OF THEM DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THE APPEAL PROCESS WAS. OF AND SOMEONE WE TOOK THEM THROUGH THE ACTUAL PREPARATION OF GETTING THE EXHIBITS IN THE EVIDENCE TO GATHER GOING THROUGH INFORMAL FIRST MEDIATION NOT REACHING. ANY KIND OF A SOLUTION THEN GOING TO FAIR HEARING A FEW OF THEM SAID ALL KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A LAWYER AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND A COMPLIANCE MANAGER IN A CASE MANAGER AND MY SERVICE COORDINATOR SHE'S NOT GOING TO LIKE ME ANYMORE. AND I DON'T KNOW SOME OF THEM DID DID REFUSE TO GO TO APPEAL. SO WE'RE MAKING GRADUAL CHANGES AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL I THINK I THINK THAT- AT THIS POINT- THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS REALIZED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AWAY. AND THEY KNOW US ON A FIRST NAME BASIS AND WE'RE BRINGING IN FAMILIES THAT HAD NEVER. ACTUALLY ASKED FOR ANYTHING AND NOW THEY'RE BEING EMPOWERED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE MONEY IS FOR THEIR CHILD AND FOR THE SERVICES OF THE CHILD AND THE CHILD IN THE FAMILY THERE THE OWNERS OF THAT REGIONAL CENTER. THERE THAT'S REGIONAL CENTER EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE FAMILIES SO WHAT WE SEE A WHOLE COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER I THINK WE HIT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE TOUCHED IN THE LAST. TENDED TO TWELVE MONTHS. OUGHT TO THIS GRANT THAT WE RECEIVED OUR I THINK THAT ARE PRESENTLY WE ARE NOW. SEEING MAYBE IS A RESOURCE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER OR LET'S JUST SAY THIS THAT AT BOARD MEETINGS. AT THE REGIONAL BOARD MEETINGS WE ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THERE AND WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT WE TAKE TO THESE BOARD MEETINGS. AND I WERE THERE AND WE'RE SPEAKING DURING PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'RE GETTING SOME OF OUR FAMILIES AND POWERED ENOUGH TO SPEAK UP ALSO FOR WHATEVER. THEIR NEEDS MAY BE SO WE ARE MAKING INCREMENTAL CHANGES ARE WE GO TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS WE INFORM OURSELVES SO THAT WE CAN AND FORMER LATINO COULD POP A COMMUNITY A CORRECTLY AND WE'RE NOT OUT THERE GIVING MISINFORMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. IT HAS HAS ONE THE LARGEST WHEN I WAS MATH IT IS A LIST THAT EITHER ONCE AGAIN THE SIMPLEST. YOUR PS OKAY ALLOWED THIS BODY THAT WHETHER THIS UP BUT HE SAID. I THINK DISPARITIES WOULD DISAPPEAR. GAIL CENTER REGULARLY THEY LAWCENTER BCS IF THE REGIONAL CENTER WOULD GIVE SERVICES YOU'RE NOT AVAIL DRESSEL SEE ON I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER SOLUTION. BUT A STOCK I SEE ON FOR THIS OCCASION YES THE REPRESENTANTES ON MEDIA SCHEDULE LAMENTABLE ALMOST AS BY NOON I AM REPRESENTING ALL FAMILIES THAT SPEAK SPANISH ONLY.

GET A FIFTH THANK MUST ADDRESS FAMILY ASSIST ALMOST IN PART THAT THIS THING COULD HONEST ALTHOUGH HE'S ON IN PART DANTE PADA. TOLD US BUT AT THE NET ON BOSS GET ALL THE SAME CLASS AS THOSE THAT GET A TELEMEDICINE. THE DEATH. WELL THAT'S A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW GOOD EVENING AMY WESTLING FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES FIRST AND FOREMOST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE FAMILIES THAT WERE HERE TONIGHT THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US THAT THIS ISSUE IS CRITICAL AND FOR CONTINUING TO BRING IT BEFORE AS- DID WANT TO PIGGY BACK ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THE SPEAKERS RIGHT BEFORE ME SAID- THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM THIS. SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED FOR ANYONE TO NAVIGATE AND THE ONLY WAY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CAN. ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IS BY PARTNERING WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES REGIONAL CENTERS ARE OF AN FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT REGIONAL CENTERS EXIST BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE AND THE FAMILIES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. I DID WANT TO- ALSO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR PROVIDING- AND REALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT'S DIGESTIBLE FOR PEOPLE- THIS IS A SPACE WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA. WE HAVE PAGES AND PAGES PROBABLY ABOUT SEVENTY PAGES PER REGIONAL CENTER EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S GETTING DOWN TO WHAT IS THE DATA TELLING US AND IN A RECENT- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. WORK GROUP ON EQUITY THE DEPARTMENT PRESENTED SOME REALLY CRITICAL DATA THEY SAID THAT- THE SLIDES A PRESENTED SHOWED THAT- MISTER GOMEZ'S RIGHT THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT TOP LEVEL FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON- FOR THE WHITE VERSES THE- ALL OTHERS. THERE IS ABOUT A 50% DIFFERENCE BUT WHEN YOU START TO DRILL DOWN THE STORY GETS A LITTLE MORE NUANCED AND A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX. WHEN YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE LIVING AT HOME WHO WERE AT LEAST THREE YEARS OLD. AND IT YOU'RE REALLY CONTROLLING FOR WHERE THAT PERSON LIVES REGARDLESS OF WHY THEY'RE LIVING AT HOME YOU GET FROM A DOWN TO ABOUT A 22% DIFFERENCE STILL WORK TO BE DONE STILL CRITICAL TO FOCUS ON. BUT IT PAINTS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PICTURE AND IT HELPS US FOCUS OUR ENERGY IS A LITTLE MORE. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOK AT JUST CHILDREN THREE TO TWENTY ONE LIVING AT HOME SO YOU CARVE OUT THE ADULT POPULATION SO NOW YOU'RE CONTROLLING FOR AGE AS WELL AS PLACE OF RESIDENCE. YOU GET DOWN 284% IS THE AMOUNT THAT SPENT ON PER CAPITA FOR NON WHITES COMPARED TO WHITES. ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. BUT IT'S ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT THIS DATA IN ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND THAT WE THINK ABOUT SERVICES THAT. AND PLACES OF STRENGTH IN OUR SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE AN EARLY START PROGRAM THERE ARE POPULATIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING MORE SERVICES PER CAPITA. PAID BY THE REGIONAL CENTER THAN WHITES SO WHAT'S WORKING THERE WHAT IS EFFECTIVE THEIR INNER RESPITE SERVICES FOR- CHILDREN LIVING AT HOME. THE AVERAGE HISPANIC CHILD IS RECEIVING MORE THAN THE AVERAGE WHITE TRIALS SO AGAIN A PLACE OF STRENGTH IN THE SYSTEM. IN SHORT IT'S JUST REALLY COMPLICATED AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF EVERYONE AND THE ABILITY TO REALLY FOCUS SOME COMMITTED ENERGY TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES TO MAKING SURE THAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN EQUITABLE WAY TO PEOPLE. AND TO FINDING WAYS TO DRILL INTO THE DATA AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH THIS EVENING ALREADY. THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY TIED TO PURCHASE OF SERVICE BECAUSE REGIONAL CENTERS DO SO MUCH MORE SO WE HAVE DATA AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT WE NEED TO USE IN NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS. LOOKING AT SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICE SYSTEM LOOKING AT- SERVICE COORDINATION THE QUALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AND- INVESTING TIME AND ENERGY INTO EVALUATING THAT DATA ACROSS THE SAME RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS NEEDS TO BE A SYSTEM THAT EVOLVES AND THAT WORKS WELL FOR EVERYONE BUT IT SERVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWELVE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- IF I COULD I WANTED A QUOTE. DISABILITY VOICES UNITED ON PAGE FORTY NINE. YOU SAID THAT THERE'S BEEN NO WAS SAYS OF THE GRANTS OF TARGETED REGIONAL CENTERS WITH THE GREATEST LEVEL OF DISPARITIES AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT TIED THE RECEIPTS OF FUNDS. TO A DEMONSTRATION OF PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT AND SOMETHING THAT- I THINK I WANTED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IF WERE. WHO WHO WHICH PACIFIC TARGETS FOR WHAT METRIC ARE WE TRYING TO FIX. IN REDUCING DISPARITIES. WHEN WE HAVE SO THE MEASURES THAT I WAS REFERRING TO SO WE THAT'S THE METRICS THAT WE'VE BEEN- I HAD IDENTIFIED SO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE MEASUREMENTS- AGAIN BACK AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE HAD THE DISPARITY FUNDS- WAS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SO USING THAT AND THEN WE JUST CLOSED OUT OUR OUR FISCAL YEAR OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WITH. SO WE COULD CAN A POPULATE THAT AND AS I SAID I KIND OF GAVE YOU EVERYBODY A SNEAK PEEK OF BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THE DATA AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AS FAR AS THE METRICS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE- ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MEASURES THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN- THE DISPARITY DATA WORK GROUP AS WELL AS THE SERVICE- EQUITY WORKGROUP BUT THE DS TASK FORCE. IN IN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE METRICS GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT WE ARE USING IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE USING OR SHOULD WE START IDENTIFYING OTHER WAYS TO BE ABLE TO- PRIORITIZE THOSE THOSE MEASURES ON THIS IS THE TIME THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT- THERE WAS AN INITIATIVE THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT WE- HAD LIFTED THE CAP I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WHAT YEAR IT WAS IT WAS LAST BUDGET YEAR THE ARTS COUPLE BUDGET YEARS. AGO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE MEASURING BECAUSE-ONE AT THAT WAS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITY OF SPENDING TO HAVE THAT IS A RESOURCE AND THE AS- MISS WESLEY HAD HAD NOTED IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT JUST ON PER CAPITA THE COST OF BREAST BUT- IS. BETWEEN WHITES AND NON WHITES- WE DO SEE THAT AS A PER CAPITA EQUAL COST- SO WHEN WE LIFTED THE CAP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO ALL THE SAID NOW CREATE A AN INEQUITY A SPENDING- I SAY AND PEOPLE I'VE HEARD. ME SAID AND IN DIFFERENT MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD YEAH WE HAVE THAT DATA BUT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE QUALITATIVE PIECE OF IT AS WELL. SO THAT IS THAT'S THE QUANTITATIVE WE KNOW THAT'S THE DOLLAR TO DOLLAR. BUT THEN- WHAT IS IT THAT THE FAMILIES ARE SAYING WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE RESPITE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING. ARE WE REALLY DELIVERING IT NO WAY THAT IS LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE IS SAID YEAH THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONGER WINDED- ANSWER THAN- MAYBE YOU'RE ASKING BUT I EIGHT THOSE ARE THE THINGS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TODAY THAT. WE'RE CLOSING OUT THOSE MEASURES AND NOW BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE NEXT STEPS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING- WITH THE WORK GROUPS- TO- HELP US IDENTIFY THOSE. YEAH I WOULD ECHO WE'VE HEARD TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES OF DISPARITY ON THIS ISSUE AND- I THOUGHT WE ALSO HEARD. PRETTY CLEARLY THAT WE NEED TO HELP PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK AND FOLLOW UP WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO. ACCESS SERVICES AND AS A MECHANISM FOR THAT- I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THAT ON PAGE FORTY NINE YOU GAVE US A COMPLETED PROJECTS- FOR DISPARITY FUNDS PROGRAM. AND I STRUGGLED TO SEE ANY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE NINETEEN OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT. HAD ENGAGED IN IT AND I'M NT SURE WHAT ARE DISPARITIES ARE BUT- SO WHAT I I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ON ON. THIS IS THIS IS ACTUALLY REFLECTIVE OF. OF COMPLETED PROJECTS NOT CURRENT PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTIVE. SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS SHARE- THAT WAY YOU COULD SEE THE- THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALSO ACTIVE- SO AGAIN THIS IS JUST WERE MEASURING THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND- SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE DETAIL THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE. THANK YOU AND- MY FINAL REQUEST IS FOR THE ADVOCATES HELP ON THIS ITEM IF I MAY- CAN I ASK FOR DV YOU TO WORK WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE LA- TO HELP US DEVELOP TRAILER. DRAFT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO STRENGTHEN THE CODE AROUND THE DISABILITY FUNDING. PER YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS- AND SUBMIT THIS TO THE SUB COMMITTEE- FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE END OF MARCH. THAT OKAY ABSOLUTELY THANK RETURNED. FROM WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND WANT TO THANK DIRECTOR BARGE MEN FOR MAKING IT THROUGH A- NEARLY SIX HOUR HEARING AND SO. ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAMINA ON IT. RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO NON DISCUSSION ITEMS AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THOSE ITEMS. SEEING NONE THIS WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING.
