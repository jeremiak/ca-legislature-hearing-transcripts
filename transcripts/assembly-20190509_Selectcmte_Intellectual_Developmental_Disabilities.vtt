DISABILITIES TO HAVE JOBS.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:40.185
IT'S HARD TO FIND JOBS AND A LOT

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.254
OF EMPLOYEE LAWYERS DO NOT WANT

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.055
TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:44.623
THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE WE

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:48.059

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:50.328
HAVING JOBS WILL HELP PEOPLE IN

YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BIGGEST

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:18.323
EXPERIENCE.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.158

PLACE AND TIME.

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.335
BUT I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT I

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:30.669
COULDN'T DO.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.604
BUT I'M ONE THAT DID NOT LAST

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.573

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.381
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:18.583
GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO BE A PART

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.354

GRIEF?

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.272
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:42.140
THAT PEOPLE DISABILITIES

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:42.741
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WOULD HEAR

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:46.244
MINISTERS PREACH THAT WOULD

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:46.845
DISABLE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DIE

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.413
NEVER HAD A LIFE WHEN THEY WERE

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.181
ALIVE WHICH IS NOT TRUE.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:50.849
THAT IS WHY I TOOK ON THE JOB AS

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.183

AND I LET KIDS KNOW THAT IT IS

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:02.894
NOT BUT TO BE BULLIED AS A

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.596
PERSON WITH A DISABILITY AND I'M

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:10.168
THE SAME AS THEY ARE BECAUSE I

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.170
CAN DO WHAT THEY CAN.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:14.506
AND I LET HIM KNOW THAT WHEN I

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.174
GO FROM SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS ARE.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.176

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:30.956
PEOPLE DISABILITIES THAT THEY

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.657
TOO COULD HAVE DREAMS AND WE PUT

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.559

OF DAY TO COULD REACH.

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:40.231
AND I AM THE PROOF OF THOSE

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:40.732
DREAMS CAN BE REACHED.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.467

AGAIN I AM THE ONE OF THE

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:48.306
BIGGEST PROOF OF EXPERIENCE IS

00:26:48.373 --> 00:26:48.640
NOT ALL TALK.

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.342
THAT PEOPLE DISABILITIES CAN'T

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:50.709
DO THE THINGS.

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.377
BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM BECAUSE

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.279
OF THESE.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:56.381
WELL IT IS REALLY HARD. TO DO

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.283

CONFLICT LAW THAT WE CAN'T

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.668

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:18.303
MONEY.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.271
WE HAVE TO TAKE SO MUCH AWAY

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:22.374

WE COULD CALIFORNIA BUT THAT

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.256

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.291
BECAUSE THE MANAGER STILL.

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:42.293
