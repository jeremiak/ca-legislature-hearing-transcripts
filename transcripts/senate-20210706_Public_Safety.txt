THE ONLY COULD USE THESE WEAPONS IN A MANNER PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT NOT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST A CROWD OR TARGETED AT THE HEAD OR NECK. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE POLICE DEPARTMENTS REPORT TO USE PROJECTILES AND CHEMICAL AGENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

NO LONGER YOU YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWO NINETY TWO IS ABOUT ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS WE KNOW THAT. THE MORE ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED HAVE TO PROGRAMMING IN THE MORNINGS AND IF THEY HAVE TO DO THAT PROGRAM IN THE MORE SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE INSIDE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN THEY GET OUT OF TO GET EDUCATED FOLKS TO TAKE THE STEPS THAT THEY NEED INSIDE. ARE FAR FAR LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE A THIS IS A RECIDIVISM REDUCTION MEASURE. THERE'S TWO ASPECTS THIS AND ONE IS WOULD BUILDING EQUITY. AROUND SOME OF THE CREDIT EARNING AND THE OTHER PART OF IT. HIS ENSURING. THAT PEOPLE ARE INSIDE HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE COURSES THAT THEY START. THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING. UNNECESSARILY TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FACILITY TO ANOTHER AND BREAKING THEIR ABILITY TO CAN TO FINISH THE PROGRAM BEING THAT THEY STARTED THE COURSES THAT THEY STARTED. AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME OF THAT CONTINUITY BETWEEN. DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CONTINUITY AND IT'S ABOUT THE- EQUITY IN. EARNINGS BUT ALSO IN MANAGING.

THE PROGRAMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SAVED MY LIFE AND HELP ME REJOIN SOCIETY AS A PRODUCTIVEEMPATHETIC AND STATE INDIVIDUAL. AB TWO NINETY TWO DOES A NUMBER OF VITAL THINGS. IT REQUIRES A CDC ARE TO TREAT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AS CO EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH OTHER FUNCTIONS INSIDE OF THE PRISONS. IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE SENTENCED TO LONGER TERMS TO HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTERESTS SURVIVORS INCARCERATED PEOPLE STAFF WORKING INSIDE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE TOOLS TO BECOME BETTER THAN THEIR WORST MOMENTS. AND IT REMOVES UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THESE PROGRAMS AND ALLOWS FOR ALL INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO BE ON THEIR WAY TO BE ABLE TO EARN THEIR WAYTO ADDITIONAL TIME OFF THEIR SENTENCES. NOTHING IS BEING GIVEN AWAY BY THIS BILL. WHILE I WAS INSIDE PRISON SERVING TIME I PARTICIPATED IN MULTIPLE RESTORED EVEN GIVING PROGRAMS I WAS ALSO PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE PROGRAMS. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A DESPERATE DESIRE TO BE IN REAL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AMONG THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE INSIDE A PRISON. THERE ARE LITERALLY YEARS LONG WAITING LISTS FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE BORDER PATROL HEARINGS UNDERSTAND THEIR VALUE AND WE ARE PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED THAT THE PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS EACH YEAR NINETY TWO.

AS SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EIGHTY TO NINETY TWO REQUIRE THE INSTITUTION TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SO THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM. WHAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. AB TWO NINETY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT OFFERS A PLACE TO GIVE ME THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON REHABILITATION.

KAYHAN SO WE HAVE A CINNAMON LACKEY SO HE'S HERE TO PRESENT. AB. SIX SIX NINE. THANK YOU CENTERED COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- AB SIX SIX NINE WHICH WAS AND AN AMERICAN OVERSIGHT FROM A- PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THIS BILL WILL ALLOW. COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE. TO USE NON ROSTER FIREARMS UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE FIREARMS PORTION OF THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT OFFICERS TO PURCHASING UTILIZE NON ROSTER FIREARMS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ADDED A REQUIREMENT FOR COMPLETION OF THE POST BASIC COURSE. BEFORE ALLOWING THE COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT OFFICERS TO PURCHASE AND USE NON ROSTER FIREARMS. THIS INADVERTENT. BUT SHE'S BEEN A BURNLEY- AFFECTED PROBATION OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE POST BASIC COURSE AS A CONDITION OF HIGHER CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS LANGUAGE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING NON ROSTER FIREARMS ON DUTY BECAUSE OF THE POST BASIC COURSE REQUIREMENTS. IT WOULD ALSO FORCE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO PURCHASE NEW FIREARMS ANYTIME A DEPARTMENT. ISSUED ROSTERED FIREARMS. I'M SORRY ANY TIME A DEPARTMENT USE ROSTER FIRE BALLS OFF THE LIST BECOMES A NON ROSTER FIREARM. BECAUSE THE CLARIFICATION THIS BILL PROVIDES WILL ALLOW COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO MAINTAIN THE USE OF FIREARMS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED. RENDON USED BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS FOR WHICH ITS PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE FULLY BEEN TRAINED. WITHOUT THIS BILL THESE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE NEW WEAPONS FOR THE AFFECTED OFFICERS. SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD EXEMPT SALES TO A COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT AN OFFICER WHO HAS COMPLETED THE FIREARMS PORTION OF A TRAINING COURSE SET BY POST. A COMPLETE TO LIVE FIRE QUALIFICATION PRESCRIBED BY THEIR EMPLOYING ENTITY AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS. WITH ME ON THE LINE IS ALL ALBERTO UP TO RICO. GREG STUPOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE COALITIONS A PROBATION OFFICER ORGANIZATIONS. BOOKER TO FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT WILL GIVE THEM A MINUTE MINUTE HALF. H. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING THIS IS A BOROUGH RECALL THE STREET CLOSURE COMMISSION ORGANIZATIONS SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION GOES THROUGH LIKE HUGE REPRESENTED TWENTY SIXTEEN SOMEONE BETTER SOMEONE ON THE BONTA CARRIED EVERY TWENTY FIVE WHICH A LOT PROVISIONAL SYSTEM POLLUTION APARTMENT TRUMPCARE NOT MUCH OF CRIMES WHICH THEY WERE NOT LOCKED TO DO BEFORE. CONSEQUENTLY FROM 201-720-1820 NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY UP UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR OF THE DEPARTMENT'S DEPARTMENT FROM THE STATE ARGUES NUMBERS FIREARMS PARTS OF SOME OF THOSE FIREARMS TRAINED OFFICERS WHO USES THOSE FARMS IN TWENTY TWENTY. TO TWENTY SIX NINETY NINE BUT MISSED SANTIAGO CARDIFF EXPANDED THE LIST OF DEPARTMENT THAT CAN USE OUR COUNTRY AS A KID YOU KNOW LOTS OF FIREARMS AND ALSO INCLUDED TRAINING REQUIREMENT WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE SUPPORTING THE SPONSORS WERE NOT INTENDED TO EXCLUDE PROVISIONAL SERVICE BUT AS FOLKS ON THE DANISH UNDERSTAND AND KNOW VERY WELL PROBATION OFFICERS UNDERGO VERY DIFFERENT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. THEN RECONCILE PEACE OFFICERS. OPTION PART CALLED AND THE DE SHERIFFS THANK YOU DO NOT GO TO ENTIRE. IN TO GO TO TEST YOUR STREET WHICH IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE REHABILITATION. DUTIES THAT OFFICERS. HAVE IN OUR SENSE TO THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION AND HOW YOU CAN. OF REALIGN. AS A RESULT- BECAUSE OF THAT THAT GENTRAN REQUIRE. R. O. CAN NO LONGER. DEPARTMENTS LONG THIRTY ONE MUST FIREARM. IN ADDITION TO THAT- JUST TO POINT OUT THAT OBVIOUS YOU AS YOU FUTURE IS A FROM. OFFICERS FOR GOOD PURPOSES AND THE NOW AS AN AMENDMENT TO CODIFY. A QUARTERLY REQUIREMENTS UNDER POST FOR THE USE OF NON MUSCLEPHARM. RANKING TOP POLICE OFFICERS ONLY UP TO GO TO THE TRAINING TWICE FOR YOUR AS A POST RACIAL SLURS WHICH WE GO TO THE TRAINING. FOUR TIMES A YEAR FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT. EIGHT THIRTY POINT ONE CLASSIFICATION A WHICH GIVES OFFICERS THE NON ACCESS TO THE NON ROSTER FIREARMS HAS BEEN EXPANDED. EVEN TODAY THE BILL BEFORE YOU FOR MISTER JONES SAWYER IS GOING TO DO JUST THAT. AND IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THERE WAS THERE WAS PROVISION TO NURTURE EXPAND. FOR STATE OFFICERS AND MORE NOT MOST OF THE MORE ACTUAL NON LUSTER FARM SO. WE BELIEVE A FROM LOOK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TRAINING AND BE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSISTENCY IT MAKES SENSE THAT. NOT MUCH FARM SPEAK. WE REINSTATED PROBATION OFFICERS. WITH ADULTS IT OVER TO GREG THE PRESIDENT THE SACRAMENT COUNTY SHE UNION AND THE LESSER PRISCO PUT MUCH TRUMP PROGRESS. MR COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE UP THIS MY NAME IS GREG STEWART THE LEAD TO VICE OF THE STATE OF ORDER. AND THE PER SECOND FOR ME SO HERE IN STRONG SO OF AB SIX SIX. IT'S AN ALL MISTER TRICO STATE THAT LIKE TO DRAW YOU WANT THE MAIN THINGS. OF THE OPPOSITE. THE OPPOSITE STATES THAT HER FOR. ALL DOES NOT COME. THE POST OF COURSE WE CANNOT BE SAFE WITH GUNS I. RESPECTFULLY THIS STATEMENT IS NOT CORRECT IN THE CERTAINLY NOT BASED UPON FACT- THE POLICE BASIC CORE STANDARD FORMAT. THE POST BASIC COURSES COMPRISES SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING BROKEN INTO FORTY THREE LEARNING DOMAINS. ONLY A SINGLE DOMAIN DOMAIN THIRTY FIVE FIREARMS CHEMICAL AGENTS COMPRISED OF ONLY SEVENTY TWO HOURS PROVIDES FIREARMS TRAINING. WITHIN THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS A DOMAIN THIRTY FIVE TRAINEES ARE NOT TO STOP THE USE OF A HANDGUN BUT ALSO THE USE OF A SHOCK WHICH PROVISIONAL STREET DO NOT USE. IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE AS WELL THAT THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS PROVIDED AND DOMAIN THIRTY FIVE ALSO INCLUDES THE FIREARMS PORTION OF EIGHT THIRTY TO TRAINING. TO WHICH PROVISIONAL MEASURES ALREADY MANDATED TO COMPLETE. ALSO UNDER PCA THIRTY POINT FIVE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO QUALIFY. YOU BUT THEIR FIREARM WHICH IS TWICE THE AMOUNT OF OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THE FACT IS PROBATION OFFICERS RECEIVE MORE FIREARMS TRAINING WITH A HAND GUN. AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ENFORCING PROBATION OFFICERS TO COMPLETE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY TWO HOURS OF COMPLETELY UNRELATED. POST BASIC COURSE TRAINING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FIREARM SAFETY. FOR A FEW EXAMPLES PROVISIONAL OFFICERS WOULD BE FORCED TO COMPLETE TRAINING DOMAIN EIGHTEEN VEHICLE OPERATIONS. DOMAIN TWENTY PATROL TECHNIQUES THE MAIN TWENTY ONE VEHICLE PULLOVERS DEMAND TWENTY FIVE CROWD CONTROL. THE MAIN TWENTY SEVEN TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AND DOMAIN TWENTY EIGHT TRAFFIC COLLISION INVESTIGATIONS JUST TO NAME A FEW. PERMEATION RECEIVED DIFFERENT TRAINING FOR A REASON WE ARE DIFFERENT WE ARE FOCUSED ON REHABILITATION TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. AND I BELIEVE ALL OF YOU WANTED TO REMAIN THAT WAY. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY OUR PROBATION OFFICERS MUST COMPLETE AN EIGHTY HOUR FIREARMS COURSE WHICH INCLUDES A FIREARMS PORTION OF THE THIRTY TWO TRAINING. BEFORE EVEN ENTERING OUR FTO PROGRAM. ARMED OFFICERS MUST QUALIFY QUARTERLY WITH A FIREARM AND MUST COMPLETE ADVANCED OFFICER TRAINING ANNUALLY. PERMEATION OFFICERS ARE QUALIFIED AND PROPERLY TRAINED AND HAVE BEEN USING THESE FIREARMS THREE YEARS WITHOUT ISSUE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR YES VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL COME BACK TO THE HEARING ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE YEARS OR ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX SIX NINE JEAN ON HERE WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM TWENTY FOUR THE THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL MODERATOR CAN WE OPEN UP THE PHONE LINE FOR THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. THAT CAN GREAT INDEX COCHAIR OF THE OPEN BRADY CHAPTER. THANK IN OPPOSITION TO SB SIX SIX NINE. IT WOULDN'T UNDERMINE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ALLOWING PROBATION OFFICERS TO PURCHASE AND SAFE OF PRESS TRANSPARENT. I PERSONALLY KNOW THE DEVASTATING BECAUSE SEVEN FIVE HANDGUNS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR MY BELOVED SON KENZO WAS KILLED AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE WHEN HIS FRIEND QUIETLY GOT A HANDGUN FROM HIS FATHER'S BEDROOM HIDEAWAYS AND WALDRON. AND MISTAKENLY SHOT AND KILLED HIM. TRANSACTION A PROMINENT CHAMBER LED INDICATOR. SENATE CANDIDATE WHO WAS KILLED I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY OTHERS TO MAKE CAN KERN SAFER AND WE MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WE PASSED THE UNSAFE HANDGUN ACT WE SET UP A ROSTER OF HANDGUNS APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE STATE AND WE REQUIRED CHAMBER LOADING INDICATORS AND MAGAZINE DISCONNECT SAFETY DEVICES ON SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL. THE STANDARDS LED TO A TWO THIRDS DECLINE IN THE STATE'S RATE OF UNINTENTIONAL GUN DEATHS THAT'S A 66% REDUCTION IN OTHER WORDS. BUT A BASIC SIX NINE BY ARBITRARILY ALLOW PROBATION OFFICERS TO USE UNSAFE HANDGUNS WITHOUT COMPLETING THE FULL BASIC POST TRAINING. MANY OF THEM WENT CARRYING UNSAFE HANDGUNS THROUGHOUT THEIR CITIES AND TO THEIR HOMES. THE RISK TO THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THE PUBLIC WOULD INCREASE. THERE'S NO REASON TO UNDERMINE THE LAWS SENATE STANDISH HANDGUN SAFETY STANDARDS AND HAVE SAVED SO MANY LIVES. IF AB SIX SIX NINE PASSES MORE LIVES THANK MY SON CAN SHOWS WILL BE LOST. THANK YOU FOR THAT TIME AND I ARE CLEANS OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW MODERATOR WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES INTO THEIR WITNESSES ARE IN QUEUE SHOULD TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB. SIX SIX NINE. TESTIFIED OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUING UP. YOUR I'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MAJOR. OKAY WELL I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT IS PROBATION FEEL THAT THEY NEED. TO STOP WEAPONS WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE A LIST OF APPROVED WEAPONS ITCHING TO BE JUST FINE. WE HAVE MISTER TREE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN OF HIM BECAUSE I AM ON THE LINE PAY ME MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO PART OF THE PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR PROBATION OFFICERS IS THAT IN AREAS COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE THEY'RE PART OF A- COUNTY MULTI JURISDICTIONAL TASK FORCES MULTI DEPARTMENTAL TASKFORCE'S. TO INTERDICTION DURING INTERVENTION OTHERS. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THOSE UNITS THERE THERE YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THE SAME WHAT THE SHOW. IS TO EIGHT THIRTY POINT ONE OFFICERS ARE CARRYING ON BOTH HER PARENTS WHICH ARE USING TO- THE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FIELDS OF THE SAME WEAPONS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. THANKS THAT'S ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND BUT ALSO WE NEED CONSISTENCY IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE BUT USED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS. BUT IN THIS ARGUMENT AFTER THE BEIJING. THE THIRD OF FROM RANKING FILE POLICE OFFICERS WHY SHOULD THEY CARE THE SAME TYPE OF WEAPONS IS RECKONED FOLLETT THEY- WANT BROUGHT SAID THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE DIFFERENT AND THEN AND WE CAN MOST OF THEIR DUTIES ARE DIFFERENT. HOWEVER HOME WHENEVER LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE SERVING WARRANTS. AND ANOTHER DEPARTMENT YOU CALLED IN TO HELP SERVE THE WARRANT TO SEARCH THE VIOLATION OCCURRED IN A NEW CHARGE YOU CAN BE. BROUGHT UPON TROUBLED COMMERCIALIZATION THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO PUSH OPTION PARTICIPANT IS TO CONSUME A BUNCH OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO. YES THERE ARE THEY ARE DIFFERENT. HOWEVER WHAT I WILL SAY IS THE SAME. BAKSHI ENHANCED ENHANCED TRAINING FOR NON MUCH FARM USE FOR PROBATION OFFICERS UNDER THE BILL ON THE BILL'S PROVISIONS AND- DOESN'T MENTION BEFORE. THEY'VE BEEN. TRANSACTION MULTIPLE LAST FOUR YEARS AND HAS NOT. INCIDENT IMPROPER USE OF A LONG HAUL TRUCKER. TODAY. MICROSTRUCTURES REFLECT ADD MORE ONE OF THE DIFFERENCE MISTER FIVE. SPEAK IS THAT THE- GENERAL ON FORTUNATE DOESNT MARK BLACK AND WHITE VEHICLES. AND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE SHOT GUNS MOUNTED WITHIN THE VEHICLES USUALLY THESE ARE GROUPS THAT- HIS% PROBATION OFFICER JOIN WITH OUR UNDERCOVER. TYPE VEHICLE SO THAT MAKES IT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE REGULAR UNIFORMED OFFICER. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO GET A CLEAR DISTINCTION AND A DIFFERENCE IN THE AND ACCESS TO THE SHOT GUN IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES. THE I GOT IT. I GUESS I'M ISN'T GUN IS A GUN IS A GUN TO MAIN SHOW IF YOU HAVE SOME THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE LIST ARE PROVED TO BE- YOU CAN USE I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO EXPAND. FROM A LONGER TOUR RUGER. OR GLOCK TO. ANYWAY OKAY. THAT AS WELL FOR YOUR QUESTION I THINK I CAN GIVE CLARIFICATION. I'M SORRY. MACARI CLARIFICATION YOUR QUESTION AS WELL SIR AND WHO IS THIS- GREG HUMOR FROM HIS GLORIA ALICIA PROVISIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. SO THE OTHER ISSUES SO IN SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW WE WERE USING A GLOCK FIVE WHICH IS A NON ROSTER SO STARTING JANUARY WE HAD TO MOVE TWO O'CLOCK THREE WHICH IS THE ONLY BLOCK THAT'S ON A ROSTER. YOU WANT TO STAY WITH THE SAME BRAND BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE AN OFFICER DOWN WE HAVE OFFICERS NOW USING TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEAPONS YOU GOT TO STAY WITHIN THE SAME WEAPONRY SO THAT YOU CAN INTERCHANGE- CLIPS SO RIGHT NOW WITH THE GLOCK THREE WEHAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO PURCHASE A CLOCK THREE BUT BECAUSE IT'S ON A ROSTER. IT'S ON A ROSTER WITH THE ENTIRE PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE NOW SEVEN MONTHS IN AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE WE HAVE NOT PUT A SINGLE NEW OFFICER TO ARMING- YET TO BE OUT THERE DOING REHABILITATION BECAUSE WE CAN'T PURCHASE THE FIREARM IN ORDER TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT READILY AVAILABLE- THE OTHER ISSUE COMES UP IS ONCE WE MOVE THE CLOCK THREE O'CLOCK THREE DECIDES TO. CHANGE THE PAINT ON THE GUN ARE- A MECHANISM ON IT NEXT YEAR IF FALLS OFF ROSTER WE HAVE TO CONFISCATE ALL THOSE CLOCK THREE IS FROM THOSE WHO JUST GOT UP. AND THEN TRY TO FIND A ANOTHER GUN THAT IS NOW ON THE ROSTER PURCHASE IT RETRAIN EVERYBODY AND THAT WEAPON- AND SEND THEM BACK OUT WHICH IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DOWNTIME THAT WE'RE NOT DOING REHABILITATION AND I'M NOT GOING COULD FALL OFF THE FOLLOWING YEAR COULD JUST BE A- VICIOUS CYCLE OF US CHASING. ROSTER GUNS HOPEFULLY BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE IT BUT EVEN ONCE YOU PURCHASE A TRAIN AND DO ALL THIS EXTENSIVE TRAINING WE COULD END UP HAVING TO CONFISCATED. FROM THOSE OFFICERS AND START ALL OVER AGAIN. OKAY THIS OF AMOUNTS BY I ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THIS IS GROWTH INDEX- I'VE I'VE SPOKEN BY THIS AND- WHEN AND PREVIOUS BILLS. WHEN WESTERN. CHIEF CAN JAMES. WHO WAS THE FORMER- HEAD OF. FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA THE FIREARMS THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION FIREARMS GROUP. AND- HE SAID. A BOGUS- ISSUE- THE- CASH FORCES GENERALLY TRAINED AS A UNIT AND- OKAY. THIRTY HERE'S THE SAME GUNS THEMSELVES GENERALLY POLICE DEPARTMENTS- HELLO YEAH B. R. FISH TAKE CHOOSE FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT APPROVED MODELS- HELLO THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MAY BE USING DIFFERENT. MODEL- HELLO. TRANSACTION IS NOT VERY. YEAH PROPRIA. THANK YOU HI I SEE NO COURTS TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO LOOK CLOSE. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I THINK ON THE POINTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION EITHER MISLEADING OR SOMEONE AN ACCURATE. AND THIS IS A REALLY REALLY CRITICAL FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PROBATION TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB SAFELY IN OUR LAST YEAR I SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT- SHE CAN MOST I HAVE NO RECOMMENDATIONS MEASURES SHOW OVER THE COMMOTION- THERE'S A MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AB SIX SIX NINE BLACKIE BRADFORD. BRADFORD NOT VOTING A CHOKE I TROUBLE GUY COME LONGER. KAMAGRA NOT VOTING SKINNER WIENER INTERNAL. FEDERAL BROKEN WILL LOSE THE ROLE OPENBUT THAT MEASURE RIGHT NOW SHORT OF THE NECESSARY VOTES NEEDED TO GET OUT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. NOW WILL MOVE TO HAVE ANOTHER AUTHOR. IF NOT. I WILL SIX X. INTERCOM LONGER DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR TO MEASURES. YOU HAVE TO MEASURES REPORTS TODAY YOU HAVE AB ONE TWO FOUR AND AB THREE THREE THREE SO WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH STARTING WITH RICHARD PLEASURE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. ONE TWO FOUR JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL AND- STATING THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS NARAL THIS BILL BY DELETING SECTION TWENTY EIGHT FROM THE BILL AND ADDING A RESTRICTION OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER UNLESS IT IS FELONY MURDER TO THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE PROVISIONS. YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS BOND FROM. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF KIANA ALDRIDGE A YOUNG WOMAN WHO ARM. WAS PURCHASED FOR SEX- AND FOR PROSTITUTION AND HER LIFE WAS PEPPERED WITH SEXUAL ABUSE AND TRAUMA- NONE OF WHICH WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION DURING HER SENTENCING- AND ALL WERE PART OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT LED TO HER TAKING BACK HER LIFE- ALBEIT- USING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THE ACLU ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY NATIONWIDE AND AS MANY AS 94% OF CERTAIN FEMALE PRISON POPULATIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE BEFORE BEING INCARCERATED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND OTHER SEVERE FORMS OF TRAUMA ARE MORE LIKELY TO LAND IN THE CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM. YET OUR STATE'S CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK LACKS CLEAR MECHANISMS TO CONSIDER RELEVANT FACTORS AND EXPERIENCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SOCIETAL TRAUMA CAUSED BY CRIMINALIZING THESE INDIVIDUALS SPANS GENERATIONS RESULTING IN FAMILY SEPARATION. AND PERPETUATING CYCLES OF ABUSE AND DRAMA TRAUMA AND DRAMA TRAUMA AND DRAMA AND WE KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES. IN AND WOMEN ARE SENTENCED DIFFERENTLY SOMETIMES BASED ON THE SAME CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR ADDRESSES GAPS AND FAILURES IN THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO CONSIDER AT VARYING STAGES OF SENTENCING IN RESENTENCING HOW THE DEFENDANT'S OWN. RAMA SEXUAL TRAUMA CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE AND OR CONVICTION. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE EXPANSION DASCHLE DISCRETION TO AVOID IMPOSING SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS ON SURVIVORS. WILL REQUIRE JUDGES TO GIVE GET GREAT WEIGHT TO YOUTHFULNESS TRAUMA SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND VICTIMIZATION THROUGH INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WHEN EXERCISING DISCRETION AT SENTENCING STAGES ALLOW COURTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE OF TRAUMA WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. WHEN EVALUATING WHETHER TO GRANT A REDUCED SENTENCE AND WILL EXPAND THE BACK A TOUR LAW TO APPLY TO CRIMES THAT WERE THE DIRECT RESULT OF BEING A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR WILL GIVE SURVIVORS A MECHANISM TO SEEK JUSTICE THAT IS HOLISTIC AND REHABILITATIVE WITH ME AND SUPPORT OUR APRIL GRAYSON POLICY ASSOCIATE AT THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND JAMIE BACK PRESIDENT AND MANAGING ATTORNEY AT FREE TO THRIVE. YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES ELEMENT AND HAVE EACH AND- MISS GRATION PURITY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY.

TURN RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN HAVING PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER TOP OF THE MUCH FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION AND FOURTH IN THE SAME CONSIDERATION WILL. GIVE THE PRIMARY WITNESS- I THINK SOMEONE ONCE IT WILL ALLOW THEM THREE MINUTES. IN TOTAL AND- I THINK IT'S OUR RICHARD MILLER. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT BY THE AUTHOR TO MOVE TO REMOVE THE CHANGES TO THE PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT FROM AB ONE TWENTY FOUR AND LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY SOME MORE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS- REGARDING AB ONE TWENTY FOUR AT THIS TIME WE REMAIN. CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE ONE TWENTY FOURTH POSITION PROVISIONS THAT GO FAR BEYOND EATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SUCH AS THE YOUNG WOMAN MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR THIS MORNING INSTEAD OPEN UP MULTIPLE AVENUES OF RELIEF TO CRIMINAL OFFENDERS THROUGHOUT OUR COURT SYSTEM. FIRST AB ONE TWENTY FOUR ESSENTIALLY MANDATES THE IMPOSITION OF A LOWER TERM FOR ALL FELONIES PROHIBITS THE IMPOSITION OF ANY SORT OF ENHANCEMENT. AND PROHIBITS CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES NO MATTER HOW MANY CRIMES WERE COMMITTED. AS LONG AS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING IS ESTABLISHED. WHEN THE PERSON IS EXPERIENCE PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL OR CHILDHOOD TRAUMA THAT IS A QUOTE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME. THERE IS NO DEFINITION OF WHAT LEVEL OF TRAUMA IS REQUIRED THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A DIRECTORY EVEN IN DIRECT LINK BETWEEN ANY TRAUMA AND THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME. THERE'S NO DEFINITION IN THIS CONTEXT OF WHAT CAN CONSTITUTE A QUOTE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OR NUMBER TWO PERSONALLY USED DEFINED BY AB ONE TWENTY FOUR ITSELF AS SOMEONE LESS THAN TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD. OR THREE THE PERSON WAS A VICTIM OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THIS VERSION OF AB ONE TWENTY FOUR MEANS THAT ANY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD RAPIST CHILD MOLESTER RESIDENTIAL BURGLAR. DOMESTIC ABUSER ANIMAL ABUSER ARSONIST HE CRIME PERPETRATORS HUMAN TRAFFICKER. OR ANYONE ELSE CONVICTED OF ANY FELONY IN THE STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM ITS PROVISIONS EVEN IF YOU IN TRAFFICKING OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. PLAGUE ZERO ROLE IN YOU THE CRIME OR IN THE PERPETRATORS HISTORY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ANYONE UNDER TWENTY SIX WILL ASSERT THEIR EACH CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION HER CRYING. THERE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY TO REPORT THIS CLAIM. NEITHER THE TRUMP PROVISION NOR THE YOUTH PROVISION IN AB ONE TWENTY FOUR HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BUT THESE PROVISIONS THE TRUE SUBSTANCE ON THIS BILL AS WE SEE IT AND IT'S SILENT ON THE MEDIAN SUFFERING OF VICTIMS WHEN THE CRIME IS COMMITTED AND SILENT ON THE LASTING OFTEN LIFE CHANGING EFFECTS ON THEIR PERPETRATORS CRIMES. BY GIVING THE COURTS NO GUIDANCE ON WHAT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS NO THRESHOLD LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA. PHYSICAL TRIAL DRAMA OR EVEN WHEN CHILDHOOD ENDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA FOR EXAMPLE IS IT UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX OR LESSER EACH. THIS PROVISION AB pONE TWENTY FOUR WILL THROW RECORDS INTO A PERIOD OF EXTENSIVE LITIGATION OVER THESE UNDEFINED TERMS AND WILL RESULT IN VASTLY. DISPARATE SENTENCES FROM COURTROOM TO COURTROOM COUNTY TO COUNTY AS JUDGES WRESTLE WITH HOW TO APPLY LANGUAGE FOR WHICH NO GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED. THIS WILL BE COSTLY BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO ONE TWENTY FOUR PROVIDES NO FUNDING. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR ALSO PROVIDES AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE VICTIMS. WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THIS IN PRINCIPLE. BUT THIS DEFENSE IS ALREADY WIDELY AVAILABLE UNDER CURRENT LAW AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS WITH COMMONSENSE REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MET. AB ONE TWENTY FOUR BE MORE CLEAR AND MORE EFFECTIVE IF IT PROVIDED A TAILORED SET OF WELL DEFINED CRITERIA. TO APPLY IN A CASE WHERE DIFFERENT RAISES THIS DEFENSE IN A HUMAN TRAFFICKING SCENARIO OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE SCENARIO. HAS WRITTEN AB ONE TWENTY FOUR DOES NOT NOW DEFINED THE DEGREE OF HARM INVOLVED NOR DOES IT DEFINE THE TYPE HE DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PHYSICAL HARM. WOULD BE A SLAP OR A SEVERE BEATING ON MOTIONAL HARM WOULD BE A SINGLE VERBAL INSULTS OR REPEATED DEGRADATION IN FRONT OF AN ABUSED SPOUSES CHILDREN. OR FINANCIAL PARK WOULD BE STEP TO TWENTY DOLLARS FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PURSED WHAT WOULD IT BE COMPLETE FINANCIAL TAKEOVER OF THE VICTIMS RESOURCES RENDERING THEM COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABUSERS FOR FOOD. CLOTHING TRANSPORTATION AND SHELTER SOME OF THE SHOULD GET SOME CONSIDERATION IN A DEFENSE LIKE. I SAID WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH HIS IN PRINCIPLE BUT SOME. MURDER MANSLAUGHTER KIDNAPPING HOME INVASION BURGLARY AND ARSON THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE THESE ARE NOT BUZZ WORDS THE ONLY WAY TO TALK ABOUT THE CRIMES FOR WHICH AB ONE TWENTY FOUR. SEEKS TO PROVIDE A- AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AS WELL AS THEY COULD TO RELIEF HE'S CAN NAME THEM AND THOSE ARE THE NAMES OF THE VIOLENT CRIMES WHOSE PERPETRATORS WILL BENEFIT FROM AB ONE TWENTY FOUR. VICTIMS OF THESE AWFUL CRIMES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE OF AB ONE TWENTY FOUR THAT MAKES THESE WHOLESALE CHANGES. OTHER PROVISIONS AB ONE TWENTY NEED TO REQUIRE WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. ASIDE FROM THE VERY REAL POTENTIAL INJUSTICES THAT MAY RESULT FROM AB ONE TWENTY FOUR AB ONE TWENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE EXTENDED LITIGATION OR TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS IF ENACTED IN ITS CURRENT STATE FOR THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED AB ONE TWENTY FOUR IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NOW WILL COME BACK TO COMMITTEE ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE OR THEIR WITNESSES. AND OPPOSITION TO AB ONE TWO FOUR HERE IN THE ROOM.

HI THIS IS STEPHANIE WITH CRIME VICTIMS UNITED AMARIN STRONG OPPOSITION OF AB ONE TWO FOUR. AND THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMAND OR QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SHOULD AUTHOR IN REGARDS TO AB ONE TWO FOUR. SENIOR CENTERS HERE. OKAY THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR SCANNER. NO QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM. MEMBERS YOUR IN THIS COMMENT THAT TIME. WHILE THERE THE TESTIMONY WAS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS- THESE FACTORS CAN ALREADY BE FACTORED. I THINK WE HAVE LOTS OF INDICATION. OF- I WILL FOCUS ON WOMEN FOR THE MOMENT OF WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING QUITE LONG SENTENCES WHO- WERE THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHERE THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS A FACTOR IN THE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE OR AND OR THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND YET IT DID NOT AFFECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO WHETHER- AND IN MY- UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH CLARITY IN THE LAW THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE THAT TYE OF CLARITY SO IT REALLY CAN BE FACTORED IN I THINK THAT'S IN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SENTENCING SO THAT IS WHY SUPPORTABILITY THANK DR PER BRING AFFORD. OKAY SKINNER COMMODORE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS- FROM THE OPPOSITION. HEY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM- AND HAVE TAKEN QUITE A FEW AMENDMENTS TO NARROW DOWN THIS BILL- SO. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT SOME POINT- THE SECOND THING IS. IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY- SO A THIS IS NOT ABOUT A WOMAN WHO STEALS A GALLON OF MILK. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED THIS IS NOT ABOUT EXEMPTING AND CONDONING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR EITHER BUT IT IS ABOUT ALLOWING THE COURTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND TRAUMA THAT LED TO THAT PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THIS IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD- BUT IT ISN'T ONCE AGAIN ABOUT. SOMEONE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EXEMPTING ALL KINDS OF YOU KNOW CRIMINAL OR FELONY OR VIOLENT CRIMES TO FOCUS ON THESE NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT CRIMES THAT DON'T. THE REALITY IS THAT MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE OR WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED. HAVE STORIES THAT INVOLVE SEXUAL ABUSE OF THEIR BODIES AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE COURTS DO NOT SEE THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED. YOU KNOW BY A PATRIARCHY. KIANA STORY APRIL STORY INVOLVES SITUATIONS WHERE MEN. IN MULTIPLE TIMES PURCHASED AND SOLD AND TRAUMATIZED THESE WOMEN AND THOSE FOLKS WERE NOT GIVEN ANY KIND OF SERIOUS PUNISHMENT. AND WE KNOW THAT COURTS LOOK VERY DIFFERENTLY AT WOMEN. WHO TAKE. HOLD OF THEIR BODIES AND THEIR FREEDOM. I'M VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN AND SO THIS WORKS TO ADDRESS THIS I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT THE VERY NARROW PRESCRIPTIONS AT THE OPPOSITION CONTINUES TO ASK FOR ACTUALLY CREATE. INFLEXIBILITY WITH IN THE COURT SYSTEM AND TIE THE HANDS OF JUDGES AND WE KNOW THAT. JUDGES DON'T WRESTLE OFTEN TIMES WITH THESE KINDS OF ISSUES THEY ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE CONSERVATIVE RULING- AND SO THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW FOR DISCRETION AND FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE COURT SO THAT JUDGES ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT ARE PART OF A PARTICULAR CHARGE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING A SENTENCING- RULING. THAT THE DEFENSE COULD WE STILL HAVE TO DISPROVE THESE THINGS SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE HAVING FOLKS COME OUT. WITH THESE RANDOM ACTS OF LOVE WILD VIOLENCE AND YOU HAVE TO LET THEM OUT BECAUSE OF THESE BILLS THINGS STILL HAVE TO BE PROVEN AND THEY HAVE TO BE DISPROVEN WE'RE JUST ASKING. THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF REAL SUSTAIN SEXUAL ABUSE AND TRAUMA ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. BACK THE TIME OF SENTENCING OR RESENTENCING AND IN SOME INSTANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESENTENCING BECAUSE THE WOMEN ARE ALREADY IN PRISON SERVING VERY LONG SENTENCES. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS. SEVEN CONSULTANT- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IT'S TO PASS AS AMENDED CORRECT A COMMA- IT'S AS AMENDED YES YES I DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AB ONE TWENTY FOUR BRADFORD I JUST REALIZED THAT IF HE DID NOT BASS PROMOTIONAL SORRY THE PILOT OF CREDITORS SKINNER MADE A MOTION EARLIER APOLOGIZE- THE CHOKE. NOT VOTING AGE OF ABOUT BUILDING COMM MARKER KAMLAGER AYE SKINNER SKINNER AYE WIENER. WIENER WRITES THREE VOTES WE CAN LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR BRADFORD LEAVE THE ROSE LAW FIRM. HE WAS MISSING FROM IT WILL GO UP TO THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER IN CARE. SO I WILL PRESENT THE NEXT BILL THAT'S ALLOWED OKAY GREAT- AND A CONTINUED GOOD MORNING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK. THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL AND ALSO STATING THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AT FIRST DEGREE BURGLARY BACK INTO THE LIST O PREDICATE OFFENSES RECASTS THE PART OF THE BILL DEALING WITH COMMON BENEFIT. WHICH IS MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL TO APPLY TO ALL OF PC ONE EIGHTY SIX POINT TWO TWO. AND ASK CLARIFYING DEFINITION OF ACTIONS THAT COULD MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. AND AMEND PENAL CODE ONE EIGHTY SIX TO TWO SUBDIVISION. B. THREE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. TO EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THAT FIX THE ON CON. I COMMITTED. TO ENGAGING STEAK TO OUT THE LEGISLATIVE. INCLUDE ABA. CURRENT GETTING IN ARE I YOU FOR BELOW LEE AND FOR. AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE SYSTEMIC CRIMINALIZATION OF CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES. OUR CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUTES HAVE VAGUE DEFINITIONS THEY HAVE WEAK STANDARDS OF PROOF AND ARE PERHAPS THE MOST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY PART OF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM 92% OF PEOPLE WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. TO THIS POINT I HAVE SHARED THIS MANY STORIES DURING MY TIME WITH THIS BILL. LAURIE'S OF A YOUNG BLACK MAN WHO STOLE A TALL CANNOT BEARD AND A GALLON OF MILK WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN A GAME BUT DID NOT STEAL EITHER OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A GANG AND WAS LEVIED WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS CHARGES. VERSES EIGHT YOUNG WHITE MAN WHO WAS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN A GAME KILLING PEOPLE WEARING LOW THROWING UP SIGNS WEARING INSIGNIA OUT WEARING COLORS AND BOASTING ABOUT HIS GANG AFFILIATION AND NOT HAVING A GANG ALLEGATION LEVIED ON HIM. NO ENHANCEMENT THESE ARE REAL STORIES OF REAL PEOPLE THAT SPEAK TO THE DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS. AB THREE THREE THREE MAKES CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT WILL REDUCE THE DAMAGING APPLICATION OF GETTING ENHANCEMENTS TO THE CRIMINAL CASES. IT ALSO MAKES THE STANDARD FOR APPLYING A GANG ENHANCEMENT RIGOROUS REENGINEERING THESE ENHANCEMENTS TO FUNCTION AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. THIS BILL ALSO ALIGNS WITH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE I WANT TO SAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT GANGS ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL IS JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE CHARGES THAT YOU ARE LEVYING AGAINST pENHANCEMENTS SHIFT THE FACT FINDERS LANDS AWAY FROM PROVING THE BASE CHAKRA TIME. AND TOWARDS THE DEFENDANT'S ETHNIC MAKE UP WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHO THEY HANG OUT WITH. WHEN AS A RESULT OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS ORDINAY CRIMES. ARE TURNED INTO GANG CRIMES BECAUSE OF OUR FEAR OF GANGS AND THE STEREO TYPES ASSOCIATED WITH GANGS THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE RATHER IT ASKS THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS ACTUALLY COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GAME IT ASKS THAT PROSECUTORS DO THEIR JOB IT ASKS THAT YOU DO NOT LEAN ON ARCANE TOOLS OF RACISM AND BIAS. THIS SENSIBLE CHANGE WILL ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE APPLIED ONLY. TWO CASES WHERE THERE'S GANG ENHANCE ACTIVITY DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GAME. AND ALSO BECAUSE OF OUR SYSTEM ONCE YOU ARE LABELED AS A GANG MEMBER YOU CAN NEVER BE D. LABELED AS A GANG MEMBER BECAUSE OF OUR GANG REGISTRY SO EVEN IF YOU AGE OUT OF BEING IN A GAME. YOU ARE STILL LABELED A GANG MEMBER AND THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU SO IF YOU JAY WALK AT EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS OLD AND AT AGE TWENTY TWO YOU WERE ACTIVE IN A GANG A GANG ENHANCEMENT CAN BE LEVIED AGAINST YOU. BY ADDRESSING SEVERAL DAMAGING EFFECTS OF GETTING EVIDENCE AT TRIAL. AND NARROWING THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE. AB THREE THREE THREE TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AT UNDOING SOME OF THE HARM CAUSED. BY CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUTES WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS- CERRO HEADED OUT OF THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND LISA ROMANO. I JUST GOT A TAX. SENATOR CAMARGO WE JUST RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT YOUR MIKE MIGHT HAVE GONE OFF FOR A WHILE THERE SO IF YOU TO MY WORK IN A TO A CHECK. DO A CHECK. AB THE MICROPHONE GOT NERVOUS. I'M HERE HI MY NAME IS LIU SAID-ALRIGHT I'LL I'M THE BILL DETERMINATION COORDINATOR AT THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM BANNER MORNING XLR MY MOTHER FLED HER COUNTRY DUE TO GOVERNMENT POLITICAL VIOLENCE FACTORED INTO THE GLOBAL WAR THE CIVIL WAR BILL MILITARY TANK THAT TRAIN CHILDREN TO USE VIOLENCE. MY MOTHER CAME TO THE UNITED STATES WITH A PARTY AND CORRUPTION ONLY TO EXPERIENCE MUCH OF THE THING HERE I GREW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO MISSION DISTRICT WHERE MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WERE PULLED OUT AND LABELED GANG MEMBERS WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD I WAS CHARGED AS AN ADULT WITH THE GANG ENHANCEMENT AND ALL MY EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY I WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE ADULT JAIL WOULD TWELVE FELONY COUNTS SUCH AS TERRORISM. MAY HAVE AN ATTEMPTED MURDER MY BROTHER WAS ALSO PROFILE IN TARGETED IN EVENTUALLY REPORTED AND LATER WITH MURDER AND SOME OTHER IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I MEAN LIKE MANY OTHER HAVE COME TO THE U. STATES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF WE THOUGHT. AND EXPORTS BUT INSTEAD OF FREEDOM FROM. THINKING WE ARE. BECAUSE OF THE GIVE ME AND WE FROM. IT'S ABOUT THE NINETEEN. 70% OF THE- PRISON POPULATION OUT OF THE ONE DAY AND MORE THAN NINETY. OF STOCK WITH THE GANG AND IN THE STATE PRISON IS EITHER BLACK OR BROWN. GANG IN HAPPENING TO LOCK. THAT PROFILING REPORT. IN MY BROTHER EIGHT THAT. HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH THE GANG AND HAS SPENT I HAD TO BET YOUR I THINK MEMBER JERRY BLUE. THAT IDENTIFIES ME AS THE MEMBER. NOW ONLY DID IT HUMANITE YEAH LET ME TO BE A TARGETED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEREVER I WENT AND MET THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY OFTEN DO NOT WANT TO BE AROUND ME. THEY LOOK MORE AT THE GENKAI THAN THAT BEATING AND OF MY ABUSER. HERE LEFT ME WITH. EVEN WHEN DEFENDING WILL NOT SEPARATE THE GENKAI ON MY THERE ARE HAVING AND- HOW. TO BE FOR INTO THE- TO GET CAUGHT. DUE TO BEING A- OF AN ABUSIVE WILL. WITH MY- I'M JUST OF ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE HARMED BY AND I WOULD THE BIG. ABUSE AND PAM AND MARKETS ARE BEEN. WORKING OUR HAVE A BETTER CHANCE. AT HAVING A FAIR TRIAL NOT THE OUT WITH. POSSIBLE OR PRE A BY AGAIN ME AND LETTING MY TO. I'M ARGUED VOTE YES ON A- THREE THREE BECAUSE NEED TO HUMANITE BLACK. CREEK NINETY HUMAN RIGHTS. CRIMINALIZED AWAY DO YOU LIVE OR HOW THEY ELECT. THANK YOU FOR THE DAY. THE ONLY SERVER. AND I FOR A DAY. PURPOSES SIGNED THE DIRECTOR OF. ISSUES WITH. AT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER HOWEVER I'M HERE TESTIFYING TODAY. IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE THE STEP FORWARD ACT. AB THREE THIRTY THREE IS A MODEST BILL THAT WOULD MITIGATE SOME OF THE IMBALANCES BETWEEN PROSECUTORS. AND PEOPLE ACCUSED UNDER THE ANTI GANG. LAW WE KNOW IS THE STEP BACK. WHEN IT WAS PASSED OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO THE STEP UP PROPONENTS OF THE STEP ACT PRESSURED CALIFORNIANS THAT IT WOULD BE USED IN ONLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES. BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE IN FACT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE USE OF GANG HANDS MRS INCREASED OVER FORTY PERCENT. WHAT CRIMES OF ALL TYPES HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS IS TRUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF LEGISLATIVE ADVANCEMENTS AND JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE STEP ACT THAT HAS GREATLY ENHANCED ITS REACH. ORIGINALLY PROPONENTS JUSTIFIED THE INCREASE IN PUNISHMENT FOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL STREET GANGS. BASED ON TWO FACTORS FIRST THE ORGANIZED NATURE CRIMINAL STREET GANGS AND SECOND THE PATTERN OF VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT THEY ENGAGED IN. BUT NOW ALMOST ANY CRIME CAN BE DESIGNATED I'M SORRY ANY GROUP CAN BE DESIGNATED AS A CRIMINAL STREET GANG AS LONG AS A POLICE OFFICER SAYS SO. AB THREE THREE THREE WOULD TIGHTEN THE REQUIREMENTS IN ESTABLISHING A CRIMINAL STREET GANG IN IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST IT WOULD REMOVE EIGHT ACTUALLY IF WE TAKE A BERKELEY SEVEN. A NONVIOLENT PROPERTY CRIMES FROM A LIST OF THIRTY THREE PREDICATE OFFENSES THAT- THAT ARE USED TO PROVE UP PATTERN OF GANG ACTIVITY. SECOND IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE CURRENT- CHARGED OFFENSE TO BE A QUALIFY AS ONE OF THE PREDICATE ACTIVITIES FENCES. AND THIRTY WOULD ENSURE THAT ONE OF THE PREDICATE ONE OF THE- PREDICATE OFFENSES OCCURS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE CHARGED OFFENSE. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IT WOULD BIFURCATE THE PROOF OF THE GANG ENHANCEMENTS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MERELY PRESENTING GANG EVIDENCE CAN MOVE JURORS TO CONVICT EVEN IF GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. AB THREE THREE THREE CAN ALSO HELP MITIGATE THE EXTREME RACIAL DISPARITIES THE SENATOR COM LOCKER HAS REFERRED TO- AS WE IS NOW 92% OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE- GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE BLACK AND LATINO. YET REPUTABLE SURVEY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHITE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIED AS GANG MEMBERS AT THIS AT ROUGHLY THE SAME RATES THAT LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN DO. IN SOME AB THREE THREE THREE IS A REASONABLE AND MEASURED APPROACH TO RETURN THE STEP BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT AND PERFECT AND TO PREVENT THE UNJUST CONVICTION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY ARE MISERABLE WE WILL NOW. I WILL MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE HERE IN OUR COMMITTEE ROOM. CNN WE WILL GO INTO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. C.

HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE LEAD OPPOSITION OF WITNESSES WE HAVE SHARE A RYAN SHERMAN AND DANIEL OWENS AND- THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING US VICE CHAIRPERSON AND NOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING FOR ME THIS MORNING TODAY I APPEAR REPRESENTING BOTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN AS WELL AS THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DEPT DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION AND ITS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBERS MMHM THIS STEP IN AND MY ASSOCIATION ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO IMPROVING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THROUGH SMART AND RESPONSIBLE REFORM BUT IN ORDER TO BALANCE OUR SOCIAL JUSTICE EFFORTS OF THE STATE WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS. RECENTLY MR EVAN HAS INSTITUTED PROGRESSIVE REFORMS SUCH AS DISSOLVING ALL CIVIL GANG INJUNCTIONS FROM WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE THEY CAN BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO RE INTEGRATING MEMBERS OF- THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVOLVED IN GANG ACTIVITY THAT NOW ARE SEEKING TO BECOME LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AB THREE THIRTY THREE AS PROPOSED TODAY SIMPLY FAILS TO MEET ITS STATED GOALS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND IT'S PROPONENTS SINCE IT- LET'S WILL REGION IN THE HOUSE AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO AND WE SIMPLY URGE OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME. THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE COMMONSENSE THEY ARE REASONABLE AND THEY DO NOT ADDRESS ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CARGED DEFENDANT ON TRIAL THEY SIMPLY GO TO THE LEGAL DEFINITION THAT EXISTS FOR WHAT THE PROSECUTION MUST PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT- THAT THE GANG EXISTS GANG VIOLENCE IS VERY REAL AND REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS AS A GANG PROSECUTOR I WORKED DIRECTLY WITH THE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DEVASTATED BY THE IMPACTS OF GANG VIOLENCE. THE SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTED JUST LAST WEEK THAT THERE IS A ONE HUNDRED AND 29% INCREASE IN GANG RELATED SHOOTINGS THERE HAVE BEEN SIXTEEN UNSOLD GANG SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS ALONE IN SAN. DIEGO IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. STATEWIDE THE RATE AND CAL. WAS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWO LINES INTO THE IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MORE LIVES THAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THREE FOURTHS OF ALL MURDERS COMMITTED STATEWIDE INVOLVED THE USE OF GUNS AND 28% OF MURDER STATEWIDE ARE COMMITTED BY GANG MEMBERS. THERE'S A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT UPON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INDEED IN GETTING RELATED VIOLENCE AND STATEWIDE STATISTICS FOR THE MURDER RATE 31% OF MURDER VICTIMS WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN. LATINO. THIS IS THE HIGHEST A NUMBER OF LIVES LOST IN OUR STATE IN THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS. SIMPLY PUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ELIMINATE THE LEGAL TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO INCARCERATE THE MOST VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND THAT INCLUDES GANG MEMBERS. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE COMMONSENSE FIRST WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DELETE THE MODIFIER ORGANIZED FROM THE DEFINITION OF A CRIMINAL STREET GANG. THE CURRENT DEFINITION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS TECHNICAL IT IS PRECISE AND IT'S PROBABLY ONLY SOMETHING THAT A LAWYER WOULD APPRECIATE BUT WHAT I WOULD SUBMIT TO THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THE PEOPLE MUST PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT A GAME IS A ORGANIZATION GROUP OR ASSOCIATION WITH THREE OR MORE MEMBERS WITH A COMMON SIGN OR SYMBOL WHO HAVE AS THEIR PRIMARY ACTIVITIES. FOR LOANING US CONDUCT THESE FELONIES INCLUDING MURDER ROBBERY KIDNAPPING EXTORTION VIOLENT. THAT ARE COMMITTED. I MERRILY WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. ORGANIZED CHANGES THAT STANDARD BECAUSE GANGS ARE NOT ALWAYS ORGANIZED THEY MAY EVEN MAKE KIND OF QUALIFY AS AN ORGANIZATION ASSOCIATION OR GROUP BUT TO REQUIRE THIS HIRE- HURDLE FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THE GANG ITSELF IS ORGANIZED SIMPLY IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REALITY OF HOW GAINES CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. IF YOU DELETE THAT TERM THEN WE CAN TURN TO THE SECOND A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO DELETE. THIS REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMMON BENEFIT OF A PREDICATE OFFENCE BE MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL. IF THE IF THAT LANGUAGE IS DELETED THEN OUR OPPOSITION CAN SHIFT TO NEUTRAL AND WE WENT COLD WE WOULD IN KOREA IN COURAGE. OR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO DO THE SAME THE REASON WHY WE SUGGESTING THIRD THAT THIS MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL BENEFIT LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE DELETED IS BECAUSE- INCREASING A GANG'S REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE IS THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION OF MOST GANG CRIME. THE AUTHOR HAS USED THE EXAMPLE OF AN ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY BE JAY WALKING AND GETTING ENHANCEMENT IS GOING TO BE OUT LATE AGAINST. BUT THERE SIMPLY IS NOT BASED IN REALITY. REALISTICALLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE LEVIED AGAINST VIOLENT CRIMINALS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CURRENT OFFENSE INVOLVING VIOLENCE. END THEIR MEMBERSHIP REFLECTS A ASSOCIATION WITH A GROUP THAT HAS ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE AS WELL. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THESE TWO AMENDMENTS AND AGAIN WE COMMIT TO SHIFTING OUR OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL IF THEY ARE TAKEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER OWENS AND WE ALSO HAVE A SECOND OPPOSITION WITNESS- RYAN SHERMAN IS THE ON THE LINE. PLANT MANAGER THANK YOU.

INSTEAD AB THREE THREE THREE ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY HARDING VIOLENT GANG MEMBERS OF THE REAL VICTIMS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SH THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF THE BILL MAKE THIS CLEAR SH THIS BILL SAYS A GANG ENHANCEMENTS DON'T REDUCE CRIME OR VIOLENCE. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE EVERY DAY THAT THESE CONVICTED GANG MEMBERS ARE PRESENT ANOTHER DAY THEY CAN'T VICTIMIZE THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE MOST OFTEN TARGETED BY THESE GANGS. AB THREE TWO THREE THANK ST THE CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENTS. CRIMINALIZED ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. AND WE KNOW THIS IS JUST PATENTLY FALSE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS TO IT ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON AB THREE THREE EIGHT. THREE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU CHAIR. I WILL MOVE THE BILL. AND- THIRD QUARTER YOU DID A GOOD OPENING HOURS THANK YOU KNOW VARIOUS QUESTIONS I COULD ASK YOU THAT COULD HELP REFUTE THE ARMED OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS BUT I HOPE YOU'LL DO SO IN THE CLOTHES RATHER THAN MY TRYING TO CONSTRUCT QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE AS I HEARD IT. THERE WAS- BASICALLY THAT- THINGS LIKE- THAT WE NEED THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS TO- IN FACT I WILL INTERPRET FURTHER PUNISH FOLKS. AND THEN THE NATURE OF THE VIOLENT CRIMES. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT WE THIS DOES NOT IMPACT AT ALL THE BASIC SENSE OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST ON THE VIOLENT CRIMES AND IT STILL ALLOWS THE PERSON TO BE CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIME THAT THEY MAY HAVE COMMITTED. AN ARMED AND- AND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES GET THE HIGHEST SENTENCE FOR DATABASE CURRENT. IN CALIFORNIA JUST IF WE IN EVEN ELIMINATING OUR ENHANCEMENTS THINKING HANSON'S INSECT RB SENSES ARE ALREADY LONGER THAN MOST OTHER STATES. INTERESTINGLY WE HAVE A- FIVE IF WE COMPARE OURSELVES EVEN THE TEXAS RB SENSES ARE LONGER IN MOST CASES IN MOST OF OUR CRIME CATEGORIES AS BAY CENSUS BEN EVEN STATES LIKE TEXAS OKLAHOMA VERY SUTHERS THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL ARE YOU KNOW THAT COULD NOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS SOFT ON CRIME. SO I SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING AS TRYING TO CORRECT. A IS NOT TO TRY TO ELIMINATE. THE CONSEQUENCE FOR SOMEONE WHO ENGAGES IN A VIOLENT ACT BUT RATHER TRYING TO ELIMINATE THOSE THINGS THAT ARE. AND THIS IS WHERE THE OPPOSITION WOULD OF COURSE DISAGREE WITH ME BUT ARE SOMEWHAT SUBJECTIVE WE KNOW AND I'VE BEEN PART OF MANY- INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THIS QUESTION. OF HOW WE DEFINE. I'M GETTING. A PARTICIPATION AND HOW YOU CAN HAVE A GAMING ASSOCIATION PUT ON YOU YOU CAN HAVE A SIBLING WHO IS SEEKING MEMBERS YOU MAY NOT BE A GANG MEMBER AT ALL. YET BY ASSOCIATION YOU ARE BRANDED WITH THIS. AND WE EVEN HAD A CIRCUMSTANCE FOR MANY YEARS WE'RE IN OUR HIGH SECURITY POSITION AFTER PRISON IN PELICAN BAY. THAT BRANDING OF THE GANG ASSOCIATION COULD PUT YOU IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR YEARS. DAND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WELL THERE ARE GAMES THAT ARE DOMINATED BY CAUCASIAN MEMBERS IS RARE TO NEVER THAT A PERSON BEING SENTENCED TO RECIPROCATION GETS THE GANG AFFILIATION SO I SEE YOUR BILL AS TRYING TO CORRECT SOME OF THESE ARE IN EFFECT BASIC PROBLEMS WITH OUR SENTENCING SCHEMES AND NOT TRYING TO REDUCE THE CONSEQUENCE TO SOMEONE WHO ENGAGES IN A VIOLENT CRIME. AND THAT'S WHY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL- EVEN BETTER THAN I ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IN YOUR CLOTHES. OTHER DO SO QUESTIONS OR COMMENT BY. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS WHAT REALLY WAS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND I THINK I WAS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. OAKLAND CLEARLY STATED ISSUES A AFRICAN AMERICAN AND BROWN KID SIMPLY LIVE IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD TO. GET TO TAG OF GANG MEMBERS AND I NEVER GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF. THEIR ZIP CODE OR HE CANONIC STATUS SO I THINK HE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS TRYING TO CLARIFY AND MAKE SURE THAT. ONE IS NOT. LABELED AND BRANDED IN SOMETIMES CURIOUS. THAT LABEL FOR LIFE AND- SILVA I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND I. AT THE PROPER TIME WITH. WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A MOTION ON THIS. BILL WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO. AT THIS PINT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMMENTS SENATOR SKINNER- I WILL TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IN MY CLOTHES AS WELL. HERE NO ONE WANTS TO OR IS PUTTING FORTH A BILL THAT SUPPORTS GANGS. I DON'T SUPPORT GANGS. A FAMILY FRIEND OF MINE WAS KILLED TWO MONTHS AGO BY A GANG. AND LET A GANG MEMBER AND BLED OUT IN HIS HOUSE IN COMPTON FOR TEN HOURS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT GANG MEMBERS BEING VICTIMS. THIS IS ABOUT EVERY ONE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE OR CREED DESERVING DUE PROCESS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW FOR DUE PROCESS IF YOU COMMIT A CRIME. PRUE AND YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME. THIS BILL IS ASKING THAT YOU PROVE THOSE CHARGES. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AND CURRENTLY OUR SYSTEM SAYS YOU GET A PASS. IF YOU ATTACH A GANG ALLEGATION. IT BECOMES A CATCH ALL FOR ALL KINDS OF ALLEGED CRIMES IN PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS. GETTING AXED BIRDS ARE NOT GETTING EXPERTS. VICTIMS OF THE CRIMES ARE GANG EXPERTS. GETTING EXPERTS ARE OFTENTIMES POLICE OFFICERS WHO WORKED PATROL WHO SCROLL THE INTERNET AND WHO KNOW HOW TO USE THE JARGON AT THE RIGHT TIME IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT AUDIENCE TO SCARE PEOPLE BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL A NATIONAL IMAGE THAT WE ALL HAVE IN OUR HEADS UP WHO WOULD GANG MEMBER IS. THIS IS ABOUT BIFURCATING CHARGES. IF I CHARGE YOU WITH SOMETHING WITH ANYTHING. YOU SHOULD DEMAND THAT I PROVE IT THAT'S ALL THIS BILL SAYS JUST PROVE IT BECAUSE THE GANG ALLEGATION CARRIES FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS YOU PUT SOMEBODY AWAY. BUT CALLING. WELL FEES SINCE. AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET AWAY WITH THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SHAME ON ANYONE WHO SAYS. THAT THESE GAMES ARE NOT ORGANIZED. THEY'RE NOT JUST FOOD GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO POP IN AND OUT. AND COME UP WITH LIKE WELL DESIGNED. ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO COMMENCE. THERE ORGANIZATIONS OF PEOPLE. WHO KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE. WHO KNOW HOW TO STRATEGIZE WHO KNOW HOW TO PAY IT. YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE PEOPLE. AND MAYBE KNOW HOW TO EVADE THEIR ORGANIZED. YOU CAN PROVE IT. IF YOU CAN PROVE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES YOU CAN PROVE THAT TO. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE SOMEONE WITH BEING IN A GANG. CALL MAYBE IT AGAIN. SEPARATE THE CHARGE THAT'S ALL. PROVE THAT THEY DID WHATEVER THEY DID. BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY. I GET AN ADDITIONAL NINE YEARS FOR STEALING A BEER. BECAUSE AT ONE POINT I WAS IN A GANG OR MAYBE BECAUSE TODAY I'M IN THE GAME BUT I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE GAME. I DID IT BECAUSE I MADE A BAD DECISION BECAUSE I'M STUPID BECAUSE I WAS AIR AGAINST. THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND THEN THE OPPOSITION WITH ALL DUE RESPECT KNOWS KNOWS THAT JURIES LEAN INTERFERE. BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO SAY I SUPPORTED GANG THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT HONESTLY. AND IN MY DAYS AND NIGHTS WORKING ON THIS BILL I WISH IT WASN'T ABOUT THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE'VE DEMONIZED BECAUSE FIGHTING FOR DUE PROCESS SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD. I AM CONTINUED. WAITING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO HELP THEM SEE WE WILL AGREE TO DISAGREE ON CERTAIN FUNDAMENTALS I GUESS ABOUT WHO DESERVES RIGHTS. BUT I DON'T JUST BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE YOU. AND JUST BECAUSE I'M SCARED OF YOU. DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DON'T DESERVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT I DO AND THAT IS ALL THIS BILL SAYS. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY EMOTION. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WE HAVE A MOTION TO DO PASSED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COUNTERMANDED. AS AMENDED AS AMENDED- COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB THREE THREE THREE AB THREE THREE THREE PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D CHOI BOGUE NOW TROUBLED NO COMMAGER COMMA- I SKINNER SKINNER AYE WIENER. THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR UP TO MEMBER NOW WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR DOCTOR FALL I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I THINK IT'S- AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX BY. A CERTAIN NUMBER BY OUR BAR QUE HAN. BECAUSE WORKING THERE. THANK YOU MISTER TURN NUMBERS AND- I WISH TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER MOTIONS. IT'S AN HONOR TO FOLLOW HER AND A PASSION. FOR THIS COMMITTEE FOR JEFF. I HAVE BEEN PREGNANT THREE TIMES NOT ONE OF MY THREE PREGNANCIES WITH SIMPLE. ONE OF THEM I WAS SO SICK THAT I ALMOST DIED AND I HAD TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE TO SAVE MY LIFE. EVERY TIME THEY CAME IN WIH A MEDICAL INTERVENTION. I'D SAY TO MY DOCTOR WHAT IS GOING TO DO THE FETUS. AND EVERY TIME THE ANSWER WAS WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. AND I WOULD CONSENT. AND WHEN I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I WAS STILL PREGNANT. I WENT TO MY DOCTOR. I WALKED IN PRIVATELY. I HAD A CONVERSATION ONE ON ONE WITH MY PHYSICIAN ABOUT MY CHOICES. SHE HELD MY HAND SHE SAID WE WOULD GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER. I LEFT. NOBODY KNEW THAT HAPPENED HIPPA PROTECTED ME AND MY PRIVACY. BUT I'M A WHITE WOMAN OF PRIVILEGE. AND I HAD EMPLOYER BASED HEALTH CARE. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE STATE WOMEN WILL GO AND SEEK THAT SAME HEALTH CARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR PREDOMINATELY UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED WOMEN AND THEY WILL NOT GET THE SAME RIGHTS THAT I HAD THAT DAY. THEY WILL BE HARASSED AND YELL THAT THEY MAY BE CHASED. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN POSTED ON THE INTERNET. THEIR PRIVACY WILL NOT BE INTACT WHEN THEY LEAVE THAT APPOINTMENT THEIR DIGNITY WILL NOT BE INTACT WHEN THEY LEAVE THAT APPOINTMENT. IN FACT IN EQUITY IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY MEMBERS. THIS COMMITTEE FOCUSES AS YOU JUST DID IN THE BILL THAT WAS HEARD BEFORE THIS ONE SO DEEPLY ON THE INEQUITIES IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE SHOULD. AND TODAY WHAT I ASK YOU TO LOOK AT IS THE INEQUITY HERE FOR THE VICTIMS. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU VICTIMIZE THAT DOG THEY ARE MORE PROTECTED THAN THESE WOMEN. AND SO WHAT I AM ASKING YOU TO DO IS HARD I'M ASKING YOU DO SOME THINGS THIS COMMITTEE RARELY IF EVER DOES. WHICH IS ENHANCE THE PENALTIES ON THESE CRIMES. BUT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE BEING DENIED THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. TO WALK INTO THESE CLINICS AND GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BECAUSE THEY TURN AWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID AND IT IS OUR JOB TO PROTECT THEM WE ARE A STATE THAT STANDS AND SAYS WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. BUT THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT WOMEN HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION IT MEANS ENSURING THEIR SAFETY SECURITY AND DIGNITY WHEN THEY WALK IN TO SEE THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. ANY DOES IT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS IT ENSURES THAT OUR POLICE ARE TRAINED IT ENSURES THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS THERE TO ENFORCE TO ENSURE THAT THESE WOMEN ARE NOT VICTIMIZED WHEN SEEKING THEIR HEALTHCARE. AND THE PROBLEM IS ONLY GETTING WORSE AND SO I KNOW I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE DO SOMETHING HARD TODAY. BUT I THINK IT IS SO CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO PROTECT THE WOMEN. NEED THESE RIGHTS AND THEY NEED OUR PROTECTION AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE ASKING FOR THIS. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES. I BELIEVE WE HAVE MISTAKES HERE FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND- SOMEONE ON THE LINE AS WELL FROM PPL WAY MICHELLE SEMANSKY DIRECTOR OF SAFETY FROM CAMPAIGNER MARTY. GOOD MORNING I REMEMBER.

THE PATIENTS THAT WE SERVE OVER 85% ARE ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED LARGELY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LARGELY YOUNG WOMEN- THE WORK FORCE THAT ARE ALSO BEING HARASSED COME FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES AND ARE LARGELY PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHEN WE CALL THE POLICE WE GET BEARING- NEED- RESPONSES AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS UPDATE BOTH POLICE TRAINING BUT ALSO.

TO REDUCE THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE BILL- THOSE EFFORTS TO BAN- IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND WE'RE CONVINCED THAT THE BILL IS BASED ON A FLAWED PREMISE CONSTITUTIONALLY AND THAT IS THAT HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION. IS ONLY GOES ONE DIRECTION IN THE ABORTION DEBATE AND IF YOU READ CAREFULLY THE TEXT OF THE BILL YOU'LL SEE A FOCUS SOLELY ON ANTI REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS CRIMES YOU'LL SEE LIMITATIONS. ONLY ON THOSE WHO WERE OUTSIDE OF ABORTION CLINICS IN NOTHING IN REGARDS TO THE HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION AND EVEN PHYSICAL ASSAULTS THAT ARE PERPETRATED BY BY CLINIC STAFF IN BY OTHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABORTION DEBATE TOWARD- DOES ON THE SIDEWALKS INCLUDING NOT ONLY SIDEWALK COUNSELORS BUT PRIESTS AND NUNS.

ANY HEARING CHEN FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE AND GIVE IT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. NOW WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MEASURE THAT ANYONE HAS HAD TO STOP. EVERY QUESTION CENTERS SKINNER I GET A CLARIFICATION OF FIVE READ THE ANALYSIS CORRECT. BOB WEIR OR FELONY COMES INTO PLAY AFTER THE SECOND OFFENSE IS THAT CORRECT. TODAY IN IN THE WAY THE BILL'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN ISN'T IT A MISDEMEANOR IN THE FIRST OFFENSE BUT- B. THE WOPULAR COMES IN THE PLAN SECOND OFFENSE. LET ME SEE WHAT. THAT I CAN HELP A FIFTY. DONNA. THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT MODELERS ONE IS- THE CURRENT OFFENSE IS ONE IS. CREDIT FENCES UP TO A YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL WHEN THERE'S INJURIES WITH A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE THIS MAKES IT A WOBBLER WITH A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE IN SO IF THERE'S AN INJURY THEN EVEN AND FIRST OFFENSE BECOMES A WAFFLER YES AND THEN THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WATERS IN THE BILL. REPORT THE OTHER ONES WERE A SECOND OFFENSE. LISA READ IT'S A NEW IT'S AND THE OTHER ONE'S A NEW OF A NEW. HI. YEAH THERE'S A WOBBLER FOR A SECOND OFFENSE OF. PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION- AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE HOLD ON. THERE'S A WOBBLER FOR- A FIRST OFFENSE IF YOU FOR INTIMIDATING A PERSON OFFERING- BURKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. FOR A SUBSEQUENT. THE SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE IS ALSO A WOBBLER SO THAT'S THE NEW CRIME THAT THEY'VE CREATED. BOTH OF THOSE ARE WATERS TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIOLATIONS. EVEN AND FIRST OFFENSE VENTING FIRST THE FIRST OFFENSE HAS A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE THE SECOND FUNDS HAS A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. BUT BUT A DOUBLE FLOWERS HELLO SO THE ONLY THROUGH THE WAY THE BILL'S CONSTRUCTED NOW. THE ONLY ONE ONLY ASPECTS THAT BECOME FOR THAT FAR WOBBLER ST FIRST OFFENSE R. WHERE THERE'S AN INJURY AND THEN THE- NEW- IN FACT THE NEW CRIME THAT IS CREATED BY THE BILL YES. ALL THE OTHERS ARE NOT UNTIL THE SECOND OFFENSE. YES BUT THERE'S PHONE YEAH THE OTHER ONE YES THERE'S TWO THAT ARE SECOND FUNDS ONCE. OKAY. OKAY. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. WHAT IS THIS ARE YOU SEE CLARITY THAT YOUR YOUR CLARIFYING THAT WERE REMOVING THE FELONIES FROM THE SHOWS ARE CORRECT AND ON THE MISDEMEANOR OF PORTION OF THE OFFERS WILL REMAIN. FOR WHICH CRIMES MISTER. WE HAVE DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE MOVING FELONIES ALL TOGETHER FROM THERE BUT ALL THE WATERS THAT I JUST AS THE IN THE WATERS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED EXACTLY AND ONLY THAT WATER SPORTS WILL REMAIN IN THE BILL. SO THE IS THE TEARS ARE PRESS THAT WE REMOVE ALL THE WHILE THERE IS THAT THE- M. STAFF JUST MENTIONED. THAT TURNED TO INTERNET OKAY IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. AM I CORRECT MA'AM COUNCIL IT HIGHLIGHTS CITY CURRENTLY HAD DISCUSSED YES AND THAT THIS BILL GOES TO JUDICIARY ROSY DIGITIZATION YOU'LL TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO I HAVE NOT CHECKED THE TIME WHEN WOULD YOU TO SHERRY SO I ASSUMING THAT BUT I CHECKED WITH IN STATE IN ORDER TO GET IT TO THEM IN TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO COMMIT HERE TO TAKE BACK THAT. WILL DRAFT HIM AND JUDICIARY CAN CROSS THEM IT TAKES TWO DAYS TO GET AND FRIENDS WE CROSS THEM IF THEY CROSS IMAGE ONE DAY AGO SO IN ORDER TO HELP THEM IT'S BETTER FOR THEM TO COST THEM. BY THANK YOU- YEAH RESEARCHER I MEAN IT. OUR PREFERENCE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH. WYLER'S BUT IF THE CHAIRS ARE QUESTIONABLE THEM NOT AGREE TO THE. SINNERS CAN. ARM I NOTICED THAT THERE IS A SUNSET IF THE BOTTLERS ARE REMOVED DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SUNSET. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS PUT IN BY SOMEBODY PUBLIC SAFETY SO WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEM IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT COMING OUT FINE FOR ME MAY. I IF I MEAN AND THAT IT'S UP TO YOU BUT THAT DOESN'T YEAH SO WHAT WE HAD DONE WAS PART OF THE QUESTION WHICH I THINK IS A QUESTION POSED BY. THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE I SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL AS DOES THIS WORK RIGHT IS RAISING CRIMES ACTUALLY DETER. AND IN MOST CASES THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY NO BUT THIS IS SUCH A NARROWLY FOCUSED BILL. FOCUSED ON A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WE KNOW WE ONLY HAVE ESCALATING PROBLEMS ITH THAT WHAT WE HAD AGREED TO WAS FOR THE WHILE OTHERS REMAIN IN FOR THREE YEARS TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN HOPEFULLY I'LL STILL BE HERE BUT MANY OF US HERE THREE YEARS OVER BACK TO PUBLIC SAFETY ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AND SEE DID THIS ACHIEVE THE GOAL WHICH WAS TO ALLOW THE RIGHT TO. SAFE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BUT THE BEST SUNSET THE QUESTION WE WERE ASKING WAS WHETHER THE LAW BLURS WORKED SUNSET ONLY RELATES TO THE WATER SO I DON'T EVEN THINK I WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT TO BE HONEST. WELL IF. ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY'S CONTROL. GIVEN THAT THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTED THE REMOVAL OF THE BOTTLERS AND- IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE OBJECTION SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE SUNSET. WELL I'M NOT IN POSITION TO OVERDO IT PUBLIC SAFETY AS JOHN PURCELL I'M JUST GONNA RESPECT THAT PROCESS IN. AND DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S AGAIN REMOVING THE FELONIES AND- WELL I SUPPOSE ONE POSSIBLE BENEFIT OF. LEAVING THE SUNSET IS THAT THIS DOES NOT DETER DEFENDERS THREE YEARS IT SHOWS THAT THE MISDEMEANOR IS NOT ADEQUATE. TO STOP REPEAT OFFENDERS THEN OF COURSE THEN WE COULD ENTERTAIN. THE LEVELLERS AGAIN BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AN INDICATION OF THAT THE MISDEMEANORS WERE NOT ADEQUATE TO DO SO. AND I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THE MOTIVATION OF THE BILL I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THE DIFFICULTY I THINK A LOT OF A SPACES THAT. I FOR EXAMPLE HI KERRY BILLS AT TIMES TO TRY TO CORRECT WERE I THINK WE ARE OVER- CHARGING AND I TRIED TO BRING IT BACK TO MISDEMEANOR BECAUSE IN MANY OF THE CASES AT LEAST IN MY BILLS THOSE SENTENCES CAN BEUP TO YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL AND A YEAR AND COUNTY JAIL IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT FOR ANY OF US I MEAN OUR LIVES ARE GREATLY ALTERED IF WE ARE IN COUNTY JAIL EVEN SIX MONTHS. WHEN WE LOSE OUR JOBS MOST LIKELY WE KNOW THERE'S MANY MANY FACTORS AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THAT RECORD SO I FOR ONE AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE ASSERTION THAT A MISDEMEANOR MEANS NOTHING HOWEVER IF WE FIND THAT THIS IS NOT CREATE THE EFFECT THAT WERE INTENDING AND WITH THE HIGH FINES IN SECTION I REALIZED THE ORGANIZED GROUPS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THE FINE SO AT LEAST- IF IT DOES NOT CREATE THE EFFECT THAT WE ARE TENDING BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A CLINIC SAFELY. AND OF COURSE WE CAN RE ENTERTAIN THE- HIGHER PUNISHMENTS. SURE WINNER I THANK YOU I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I. E. I AM WAS OPEN TO SUPPORTING THIS AND YOU KNOW AND ANY OF ITS FORMS BUT I APPRECIATE- THE OTHER WORKING WITH THE CHAIR ON ON THIS ON THIS- ISSUE I DO ONCE I THINK HI I CANNOT BEGIN TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO AS A SUPERVISOR AS SENDER RIGHT GOT INTO PUBLIC ARGUMENTS WITH POLICE OFFICERS WHO. TELL THE PUBLIC- IT'S ONLY A MISDEMEANOR NOW- IF SAID AROUND PROP FORTY SEVEN TO MISDEMEANOR SO WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHICH IS. JUST PATENTLY FALSE AND TO SIGNAL TO THE PUBLIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN. MISDEMEANOR SOMEHOW DON'T EXIST ONE AS CENTER SKINNER QUICKLY MENTIONED YOU CAN DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF TIME IN COUNTY JAIL- THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE. AT TIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO WILL NOT- TAKE ACTION ON MISDEMEANORS AND AT TIMES ARE SOME COUNTIES WHERE THE COURTS TO AN ACTOR MAYBE THE DA. IT DOESN'T ACT AND YOU KNOW MIGHT BE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE AS WE NEED TO HAVE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW. SHOCKINGLY LONG SENTENCES YOU CAN ACHIEVE. WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH YOU KNOW WITH SHORTER SENTENCES. SO I- YOU KNOW I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY- IN OUR EFFORTS ARE CAMANCHE JUSTICE REFORM I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND I THINK. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GENERAL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING THESE CRIMES AND THEY ARE CRIMES FRANKLY AT TIMES. CAN BE IT CAN BECOME VERY SOCIOPATHIC IN TERMS OF TO ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO TERRIFY INTIMIDATE AND HARASS PEOPLE INTO NOT SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE PEOPLE ARE. ENTITLED TO WHATEVER VIEWS THEY WANT TO HAVE ONE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ON ON ABORTION SERVICES IT'S HARD- BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD STALK AND HARASS AND INTIMIDATE AND JUST TRY TO TERRIFY. PEOPLE PRIMER IN WOMEN'S IN GENERAL FROM SEEKING SERVICES IS CHARGED WITH SOCIOPATHIC AND SO THESE ARE NOT- THIS IS NOT COMPARABLE TO. PEOPLE WERE GETTING ARRESTED ON YOU KNOW LOW LEVEL CRIME DRUG OFFENSES AND HAVING THEIR LIVES DESTROYED THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TARGETING AND- AND JUST DEEPLY HARMING. OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AND SO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM FACING. CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING CON TO FREEDOM. BOB FOR DOING THAT THE FINES ARE GOOD I SUPPORT THAT BUT AS IT'S BEEN NOTED. THOSE CAN BE PAID BY OTHER PEOPLE SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR BRINGS FORTH. THANK YOU. FOR THE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE PAID ON THIS NOW. ALSO I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE AND- EXCEPT- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AHA WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VERY. DIFFICULT ISSUE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WOMEN ARE YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO IS SEEKING MEDICAL CARE SHOULDN'T BE HARASSED AND THREATENED I JUST SIMPLY BY- SEEKING A- MEDICAL SERVICE OR ANY TYPE OF SERVICES SO TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE BUT ALSO WE- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT YOU NO. LONGER SENTENCES DOES NECESSARY TO DETER DETER CRIME BUT AS A HARSH CALLING FROM OAKLAND STATER BERKELEY- WE'VE SEEN WHAT THIS PANDEMIC IS DOWN TO OUR LIVES IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR SO. IT CAN HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS IF YOU'RE- UNEMPLOYED FOR A YEAR IF YOU'RE IN JAIL FOR YEARS SO- THAT'S NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT- WE'RE SEEKING A MOTION ON IT. AB BUT- I'M SORRY AT THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX. IT'S MOVED BY SENATOR AND SENATOR WIENER WE HAVE A DO. AS AMENDED. NOT TO TAKE THAT A COMMITMENT TO AMENDED WILL THE COMMITMENT TO AMEND THE BILL AND TO INSURE. SHUTTLE MISTER MAN JUST CLOSE AND COMING I WANTED YES I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I DO AND I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AND ESPECIALLY WITH SKINNER'S FOCUS ON. BIG DATA WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I HEAR ALL OF YOU AND I VOTE FOR MOST OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM MEASURES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCE SENTENCES. BUT BUT LOSING YOUR OF YOUR FREEDOM IS SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT BEING DENIED THIS HEALTHCARE. AND HAVING TO CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM BECAUSE YOU WERE DENIED THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. IS EQUALLY AS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE WOMEN WHO SUFFER THAT AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE THINGS AND KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION OF. WHETHER OUR SYSTEM TREATS VICTIMS WHO ARE WOMEN OF COLOR IN THE SAME WAY THAT TREATS OTHER VICTIMS. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU IN LOOKING AT THE LAWS IN DOING THIS. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO. RIGHT YOU LEAVING THIS COMMITTE TODAY IT IS A FELONY. TO VICTIMIZE THE DOG AND IT WILL NOT BE A FELONY TO VICTIMIZE THESE WOMEN SO. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY URGE ASPIRIN I BOTH. THANK YOU- COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGAIN- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE- AUTHOR WILL TAKE THE MEASUREMENTS AND JUDICIARY. AND- HE SAID YEAH AS IT MOVED TO JUDICIARY THANK YOU. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIXTY PASSED TO JUDICIARY BRADFORD ARM BRADFORD AYE CHOI BOGUE NO TROUBLED NEVER COME LONGER I HAVE COME UNDER AYE SKINNER.

OF THIS COMMITTEE AND HIS STAFF WORKING WITH MY TEAM AND MYSELF IN STRENGTHENING THIS BILL AND ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- FOR HIS DILIGENCE AND HIS FORTITUDE IN THIS- IN THIS REGARD- WE WORKING WITH- WITH ON AN ON AMENDMENTS TO SATISFY ALL THE CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION WHO I HOPE WILL JOIN IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL EIGHT FIFTY NINE. I AM COMMITTED TO TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- WHICH LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS PROPOSED IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS BILL STRONGER TO TRULY GET AT THE ROOT OF THIS ISSUE. AMONG THE OTHER POLICE REFORM BILLS. EXCUSE ME THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT- PIECE TO THIS PUZZLE IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE DANGEROUS CULTURE- THAT PRESENTS ITSELF AND HAS PRESENTED ITSELF FOR DECADES- NOT ONLY IN THIS STATE BUT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. LOYOLA MARYMOUNT REPORTS FOUND NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF ACTIVITY AMONG EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT POLICE GANGS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MANY OF THEM HAVE TATTOOS. HAND SIGNALS RITUALS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO STREET GANGS. THIS BILL WILL CALL OUT THE- THE- THE SECRECY OF THE OR THE SECRET- NATURE OF POLICE GANGS AND IT WILL BE BAD IN THIS STATE. AB NINE THREE NINE FIVE EIGHT WILL ALSO MAKE UP OFFICERS PARTICIPATION IN POLICE GANGS GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION. HOW CAN WE EXPECT AN OFFICER TO A POLE THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF HIS OR HER COMMUNITY WHEN THAT OFFICER IS PRESSURED WITH IN THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT TO JOIN A POLICE GANG LET ME PAUSE HERE. IN MY OWN DISTRICT THE SIXTY FOR THE FAMILY DISTRICT COMPTON SHARE THERE IS ONE DEBUSSCHERE WHO- WAS BULLIED FOR FIVE YEARS PLACED IN DANGEROUS POSITIONS BECAUSE THIS INDIVIDUAL REFUSE TO BE PART OF THE GANG CULTURE THAT EXISTS IN THAT DEPARTMENT- AND HE BECAME A WHISTLE BLOWER AND SHOVEL. AND DEMONSTRATE WHAT WAS GOING ON THIS TOURNAMENT HAS RECEIVED BULLYING AND THREATS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO THIS GIVE RISE TO ASSEMBLY BILL NINE FIVE EIGHT AND IF. IF INDIVIDUALS REFUSED TO JOIN THEY ARE OSTRACIZED. BLACK SUPPORT EVEN FACE RETALIATION THESE ARE GROUPS THAT CELEBRATE. EXCESSIVE FORCE DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION AGAINST OTHER OFFICERS. WHO RESIST PLEASE REFORM IS TAKING PLACE AB FIVE NINE. EIGHT FOUR NINE FIVE EIGHT WILL PUT FORTH REFORM THAT HAS- HAS BEEN NEEDED FOR DECADES TO READ THIS PERVASIVE CULTURE OF THOSE WHO ABUSE THE POWER. WHICH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS GIVEN TO THESE OFFICERS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO SERVE AND PROTECT I STAND HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU WITHOUT A CO SPONSOR. ISN'T IT BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL POLICE OFFICER GANGS ARE NO LONGER IN THIS STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY ARI WHO WE HAVE AND YOUR LEAD WITNESS BRANDON OUT BY MY CORRECT.

WE ARE THE PROUD CO SPONSOR THIS MUCH NEEDED BILL. AT THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THE BILL WILL BE AMENDED MOST MEDICAL NEEDS FURTHER ANALYSIS ON OUR PART. HOWEVER WE ARE HOPEFUL THESE AMENDMENTS WILL NOT WEAKEN THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND ALLOW US TO CONTINUE RESPONSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM IS ANYONE HERE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE FIVE EIGHT. SEEN ONE HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM OF TWENTY.

ALL RIGHT WE NOW WILL GO TO OPPOSITION- MMHM WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS A MAX HUNTSMAN. HUNTSMAN WHO'S HERE TO TESTIFY- MODERATOR DO WE HAVE MR HUNTSMAN ONLINE. YES YOU DO YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES MY NAME. MY NAME IS MAX FUND SPENT ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I PERSONALLY THANK ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON FOR HIS- SUPPORT. BARTENDERS COUNTY OPPOSES UNLESS AMENDED ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE AS YOU DESCRIBED THAT'S THE PLAN SHE COULD SEE AN INTIMIDATION ARE WHAT MAKE A GROUP OF ARMED MEN HEY GANG. THREE DECADES AGO A FEDERAL JUDGE FOUND THE LARGEST LOS ANGELES DEPUTY GANG TO BE A WHITE SUPREMACIST ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN PROHIBIT THE GANGS L. AST HAS EMBRACED THEM AND AS A AS OF A DECADE AGO A MEMBER OF THAT GROUP THE VIKINGS. HAD RISEN TO THE UNDER SHARE THEM PARTICULARS PROTECTING L. AST SECRECY BY SENDING A HAND PICKED TEAM TO INTIMIDATE YEAH YEAH IT ENDED BADLY FOR THE PRESENT BADLY BUT STILL HE HAS CALLED FOUGHT AGAINST PROHIBITING THE GANGS. WHEN SURE OF ME IN A WAY THAT TOOK OFFICE L. AST BEGAN OPENLY ADOPTING SECRECY SECRECY. AND INTIMIDATION. OCTOBER DEPART POLICY. ONE OF THE NEW FIRST. WAS TO UNLOCK WE A POLITICAL I. THAT USED DEPUTY GET MEMBERS. TO INTIMIDATE ANOTHER DEPUTY AND BEEN FIRED. WHEN I PUBLICLY RECORDED BUT THE SHERIFF WAS DOING. GREAT NEED TO KEEP THE RECORDS SECRET ANY PLACE ME ON THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION ARE INVESTIGATING IT. IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE L. AST HAS DOUBLED DOWN ON THESE TACTICS FORMING A POLITICAL DIRTY TRICKS WHILE. RESTING JOURNALISTS AND THREATENING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST THOSE WHO SPEAK OUT IN OPPOSITION. THE CONDUCT HAS ONLY WORSENED SINCE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED A CIVIL. RIGHTS INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEPARTMENT. NEWMAN CORPORATE. INCLUDING REASON ONCE AGAIN FAILURE TO POP DISCLOSE DEPUTY MISCONDUCT SECRECY. AND THE USE OF POTENTIALLY LETHAL FORCE AGAINST PEACEFUL PEACEFUL PROTESTERS INTIMIDATION. OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO PROTECT THE GANGS WITH A CODE OF SILENCE. MOST NOTABLY A GANG STYLE BEATDOWN OF DISRESPECTFUL DEPUTIES BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE BANDIDOS WAS CRIMINALLY INVESTIGATED WITH TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES PERMITTED TO REFUSE TO GIVE STATEMENTS AGAINST THEIR FELLOW DEPUTIES IN VIOLATION OF DEPARTMENT POLICY. NOT SURPRISINGLY THE COVERUP RESULTED IN NO CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ASKED EIGHTY NINE FIVE EIGHT BE AMENDED TO ADDRESS THE RACISM OF THESE GANGS. BANDIDOS AND EXECUTIONERS EXCLUDE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND FEMALE MEMBERS AND THE LATTER SPORS. IN ROCKY HELD ON EXTENT TO. ALL COULD PROHIBIT MEMBERSHIP JUST TO BE DOES NOT NEVER IN OUR QAEDA THE CAKE. AND TO PROVIDE FOR EXT INVESTIGATION. WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS THE BILL WILL BE USED AS COVER FOR CONTINUED INACTION. THE LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS NOT USED INSTEAD BEGAN POLICY TO FIRE A SINGLE GANG MEMBERS. BECAUSE IT CONTAINS THE SAME LOOPHOLES THAT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL THAT IS USED TO ENFORCE THE CODE OF SILENCE THAT HAS ALLOWED LET'S HANG MEMBERS INTO POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP AGAIN. SECRECY AND INTIMIDATION HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT RHYMES. THANK YOU TECHNICALLY MY TEST MORE. THANK YOU. NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE HEARING ROOM IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB NINE FIVE EIGHT. JEAN NINE AND NOW WILL MOVE TO TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL MODERATOR NOW LET'S GO TO PHONE LINES INTO YOUR- CALLERS WHO WISH TO TESTIFIED TELEPHONICALLY ARGUED. IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE FIVE EIGHT. THAT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB NINE FIVE EIGHT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUED UP. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW FOR THE DISCUSSION CENTER ONE. THE BILL HAS BEEN MODE IN ADDITION DISCUSSION OR DEBATE HERE. HI I JUST WANT TO. FOLLOW THE COMMENTS THAT- SENATOR PALMER STATED A FEW MONTHS AGO IN REGARDS TO HER BILL- AB THREE THREE THREE- THE COMMONSENSE APPROACH OF. GETTING ENHANCEMENTS THAT CHANGE INDIVIDUALS LIVES WHEN YOU'RE BLACK AND BROWN BUT ALMOST A HYPOCRISY OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT HAS BEEN AFFORDED LAW ENFORCEMENT. OVER THE LAST FIFTY SIXTY YEARS WILL IT'S NO DOUBT GANGS EXIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- IT IT THERE ARE GANG MEMBERS WHO HAVE JOINED POLICE DEPARTMENTS SIMPLY TO CONTINUE THEIR GANG ACTIVITY THERE'S NO. SECRET THERE ANDERSON AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP HE SAID- IT'S SIMILAR BUT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE A POLICE GANG IS NO DIFFERENT THAN A STREET GANG- THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE AND- I'VE IT OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AND WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO PROBABLY. SHOULD FOR THEIR TATTOOS. IT THE VIKINGS THE UP DOUBLE GLOBAL AS THEY CLEARLY SET TRIP JUST LIKE ANY OTHER STREET GANG. AND IT'S A DANGEROUS ELEMENT AND THERE'S FBI REPORT AND STUDY THAT CLEARLY STATES THAT THE BIGGEST RECRUITMENT. OF INDIVIDUALS PART OF AREA NATION WHICH IS A GANG THE KKK WHICH IS A GANG IS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HOLD THESE INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM POLICE REFORM THAT WE HAVE A FAIR. WAY OF A RADIC HATING THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER FOR. THE PUBLIC TO HAVE THE TRUST THAT IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR ONE PERSON TO WORK EFFECTIVELY AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY SO- ON THAT NOTE HI THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE.

LOG THE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES ONE FORSMAN GANKS TO INCLUDE GROUPS THAT ENGAGE AND HARASSMENT. EXCLUSION AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR STATUS AND PROTECTED CLASS FILM THAT COULD BE GENDER THAT COULD BE REYES AGREE H.

BUT I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME VERY CLEARLY THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO GET AT THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE- THAT EXIST BASED ON WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED IN MY CITY OF COMPTON AND FOR THE DEPUTY SHERIFF TO GO FIVE YEARS BEING PLACED IN BEING INTIMIDATED BECAUSE THAT'S INDIVIDUAL REFUSED TO BE PART OF A GANG AND IN THAT SAME GAME THAT EXISTS IN A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT A POLICE DEPARTMENT. IT IS THE SAME GANG THAT NOW YOU'RE CHARGED WITH TRYING TO RATTA KATE ON THE STREETS. YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT FROM ANYONE ELSE. WHERE THE A CRIPPLED. IF YOU WERE A BATCH. AND WE WANNA RADIC HATE THAT SO TOO IS TO IMPLY THAT THIS BILL IS TO COVER UP IN ACTIVITY THIS IS. ACTIVITY AT ITS BEST IN A VERY PROACTIVE WAY. SO MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE.

MR MORE SECURITY. YES SIR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION- WHILE WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIM WORKING- TEAM WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND CONSIDERING OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS CDA STILL HAS CONCERNS ABOUT TWO PARTICULAR PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL OUR GREATEST CONCERN DEALS WITH THE PRESUMPTION CONTAINED OF THE BILL IN FAVOR OF RESENTENCING IT STATES QUOTE THERE SHALL BE A PRESUMPTION. FAVORING RECALL AND RE SENTENCING OF THE DEFENDANT WHICH MAY ONLY BE OVERCOME IF A COURT FINDS THE DEFENDANT IS AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION CITY OF SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY POINT EIGHTEEN THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A SO CALLED SUPER STRIKE A VERY NARROW SET OF VIOLENT FELONIES INCLUDING MURDER SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSES CHILD MOLESTATION ASSAULT WITH THE MACHINE GUN ON A PEACE OFFICER OR FIREFIGHTER. AND POSSESSION OF A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION THIS PRESUMPTION WILL ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE THE PROSECUTION TO BE NOSTRA DOMINANCE AND PROVED TO A COURT THAT THE DEFENDANT IS AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO COMMIT ONE OF THESE SUPER STRIKES IN THE FUTURE. AND THE PRESUMPTION ARBITRARY FAVORING RESENTENCING WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE CASE INJURY TO THE VICTIM IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY FOR THE PARTICULARS OF THE OFFENDER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PRESUMPTION IS SIMPLY NOT NEEDED THE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES THAT THE COURT QUOTE SHALL APPLY THE SENTENCING RULES OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND APPLY ANY CHANGES IN LAW THAT REDUCED SENTENCES WILL PROVIDE FOR JUDICIAL DISCRETION SO AS TO ELIMINATE THE SEVERITY OF SENTENCES. AND TO PROMOTE UNIFORMITY OF SENSORS AND QUOTE THE BILL ALLOWS FOR A REDUCTION IN THE DEFENDANT'S. TERM APPROVED IT IMPRISONMENT AND EVEN THE ANSWERS OF. INCLUDE IN LESS RELATE OFFENSE. AND THE JUDGE MAY CONSIDER A WHOLE HOST OF CRITERIA INCLUDING POST CONVICTION FACTORS THE BILL ALSO MANDATES THE HEARING WHERE ALL PARTIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. JUDGES SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THEIR CELL DISCRETION AN EXISTING RULES TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TOTALITY. JERRY PRESUMPTION THAT TILTS THE SCALES OF JUSTICE IF ANYTHING THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF THE ORIGINAL SAYS WHICH IS A VALID AND FINAL JUDGMENT WOEFULLY IMPOSED UNDER LAW AND MANY TIMES AFFIRMED ON APPEAL. OUR OTHER CONCERN DEALS WITH RECENT AMENDMENT TO THE BILL THAT EXPANDS RESENTENCING TWO OUT OF CUSTODY DEFENDANTS. WHAT IS THE POINT OF RESENTENCING A DEFENDANT WHO IS NOT CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. THIS COULD OVERWHELM COURTS WOULD MOVE RESENTENCING HEARINGS AND BECAUSE ADDED AN UNNECESSARY WORKLOAD PRESSURES ON LOCAL PROSECUTORS AGAIN WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING'S CONSIDERATION OF ALL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. BUT WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL GIVEN OUR CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE THANK. THANK YOU NOW WILL COME BACK TO THE HEARING ROOM IS THERE ANYONE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MAJOR I SEE NO ONE THERE WILL MOVE DOWN TO TWENTY FORTY. THERE'S NO ONE IN THAT ROOM EITHER SO MODERATOR LET'S GO TO OUR PHONE LINES AND SEE IF THERE IS A WITNESSES. WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB FIFTEEN FORTY.

THAT WAS ASKED TO REVIEW THE PENAL CODES INCLUDED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. THEY TOOK THE STARTER TOOK THEIR PURPOSE VERY SERIOUSLY- THE BILL IS AMENDED. DEMANDS THE RESENTENCING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THE COURTS- ED BOARD OF WHAT THE COURTS PRESUMPTION HEROES AND WHAT THEY CAN DO SO WE THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD. RECOMMENDATION I THINK I JUST UNDERSTOOD UNDERSCORE WHY THIS IS AN ISSUE CDC ARE RECOMMENDED- EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CASES TO BE REVIEWED THE COURTS ONLY TOOK UP TWELVE HUNDRED. OF THOSE TOLD HUNDRED THE ONLY HEARD SIX HUNDRED CASES SO AGAIN. THAT MEANT THAT OVER. TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ALL WAITING WHO RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED BY CDC ARE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE THEIR CASES EVEN HURDLE FOR REVIEW.
