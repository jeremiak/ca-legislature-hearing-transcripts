OUTBREAK WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE OUR ACTING PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR DR PAN HERE WITH US TODAY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE RATING SYSTEM AND HOW OLD WAS DETERMINED AND COMMUNICATED WELL SORRY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THE STATE HAD WITH THE CAL READY SYSTEM IN COVERT NINETEEN REPORTING IN AUGUST AND DOUBT THE RELIABILITY OF THE DATA I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERS FEEL FOR ME REALLY REQUESTED THE HEARING AND -- ASKING US TO FOCUS ON DATA WE THINK OBVIOUSLY DATA IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE COLLECTING AND DISTRIBUTING ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC HAVING SAID THAT I KNEW WE WERE WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC I KNOW THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO LEARN ABOUT THE DISEASE AND CONTINUING TO REALLY DO THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD TO DO ON A SCALE THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD TO DO SO KNOWING THAT I KNOW THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR OFFICES OF TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS OUR -- VARIOUS AGENCIES TO AGAIN BE RUNNING A RESPONSE TO A PANDEMIC AT THE SAME TIME BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BILL DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION THAT REALLY HASN'T BEEN IN NEARLY AS MUCH DEMAND AS AS IT IS NOW SO AGAIN -- LET ME -- LET ME START TO SEE FIFTH MEMBERS HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS THE MEMBERS WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT AS FAR PUBLIC THANK THE CHAIR FOR THIS OF MEMBERS HAVE ASKED -- TO TO HAVE THIS HEARING INTERVIEW GOING TO OUR DATA SYSTEMS IN AND OF COURSE THE IMP HAS WERE MALE THIS PANDEMIC THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY DECISION MAKERS BUT OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS SO THAT WE CAN -- WE CAN ADDRESS THIS PANDEMIC AND AND AND GET COVERED NINETEEN UNDER CONTROL SO I JUST WANNA PUBLIC THANK THE CHAIR FOR THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS DR RANDALL THANK YOU AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS US NOW IN THE MIDST OF WHAT TOO MANY OF US HAVE CALLED THE PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY AND IF I COULD I WANT TO SHARE A BIT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOW COMMUNICATE AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT A PODCAST THE SPEAKER HAS ASKED ME TO LISTEN TO ONE THAT HAD ELIZABETH OUTCOME ON IT IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE -- ONE PODCAST LOOKS AT THE EFFECT THAT THE PREVIOUS PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY THAT OCCURRED IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN ON FIRST AND ELIZABETH OUTCOME WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE BIBLE MODERNIST SPOKE ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT AND OFTENTIMES WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDST OF THESE PANDEMICS AS WE GET FROM A TEST WE GET FOCUSED ON THE NUMBERS WE GET FOCUSED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND YES THERE ARE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHT WHO HAVE DIED FLOOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE FORGET WHAT OCCURS WITH EACH LIFE AND SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AT THE START OF THIS TO ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY FOR WE ARE WATCHING SOMEONE WHO WILL HAVE LEAST THOSE SWITCHES ON THEIR MASK AND I WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT CAMPAIGN AND SPEAK ABOUT WHAT I SAW YESTERDAY BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR STATE HAS BEEN PREPARING NOT INHERENTLY FOR PANDEMICS BUT FOR EMERGENCIES AND HAVING BEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR WANTS TO APPRECIATE WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED YESTERDAY BUT WE DID FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT INTO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SO THAT OUR FOOD BANKS ARE BETTER ABLE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE THIS PANDEMIC AS A PUBLIC SERVANT HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES AND I'VE SEEN THE NEED FROM SO MANY WHO ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OFTEN TIMES AS OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN RAVAGED WELL WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON OUR PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR OWN TABLES THIS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DOLLARS HELPED OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOOD BANK TO BE ABLE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE COLD STORAGE SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE GOODS WERE GETTING TO COMMUNITY WHO NEEDED IT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IF I COULD BECAUSE THEY THERE WERE TWO WOMEN CEOS NATALIE CABLES AND KENDYL NINE WHO WERE PROMOTED DURING THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC WHO HAVE MET THIS MOMENT WHO ARE DOING THINGS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE MAKING THINGS IMPROVED BUT WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS THE CONTINUED NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS OUTREACH THAT THEY ARE DOING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS SUCH AS CURBSIDE TO GO FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE GOODS AND NEEDS BUT THAT THEY WEREN'T INHERENTLY DOING THIS IN A CULTURAL AND LINGUISTICALLY WAY AND WE'RE HAVING TO USE SOME OF THEIR PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS AND SO I'M WONDERING IF AND AS WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND DATA AND INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING AN OUTREACH AND INVESTING IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD JUST BE REMISS NOT TO TALK ABOUT MY REGION I'VE BEEN A BIT OUTSPOKEN WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT FRESNO IS MOVING FORWARD AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO RECEIVE INFORMATION WHETHER OR NOT WE MOVE FROM PURPLE INTO RED WE HAVE A GLIMMER OF HOPE BUT I WOULD JUST WANT US TO BE VIGILANT AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM BECAUSE IF WE DO GROUND OURSELF IN THIS AS THE PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE WILL ALSO LOOK BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND REALIZE THAT THE MOST THE HIGHEST MORTALITY CAME FROM SEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THAT IT IS THESE MONTHS THAT ARE CRUCIAL THAT WE NEED TO BE VIGILANT AND MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR STATE AND TO ME TO THIS MOMENT AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE PURSE STRINGS AND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ASKING THESE TOUGH QUESTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION I JUST WANNA THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SO WE HAVE FIRST DR ERICA PANDAS ARE ACTING STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING AND -- COMMITTEE TO PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO PRESENT TO YOU AND -- I WANT ACTUALLY IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- SOME SOME WORDS ATTRACT REGULAR JUST SAT AROUND THIS IS OUR MOMENT AND WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS AND MOVEMENT THROUGH THIS BLUEPRINT OF THAT TIER CAN WORK AND I CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU BUT BUT AS ALSO MENTIONED IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE DO NOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN THIS IS A TIME WHERE -- FLU SEASON IS AROUND THE CORNER AND ALL OF THEM INTERVENTIONS GIRL DOING THIS PHYSICALLY DISTANCING WEARING AMOUNTS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WHICH WILL BE THE THEME OF MY PRESENTATION TO ALLOW FOR THINGS RE OPEN WE CANNOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR PROGRESS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE ASEAN SECRETARY GALA IS PRESS CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME PLATEAUS AND WE AGAIN WANT TO GO SLOWLY AND SAFELY SO -- AGAIN WE CANNOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN BUT WE ALSO WANT ALLOWED THINGS RESUME SO WITH THAT I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR CALIFORNIA BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER ECONOMY AND IT'S A PLAN ESSENTIALLY TOO SLOWLY WE LUNCH ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TO GRADUALLY ALLOW FOR LOOSENING -- BUT ALSO HOW IT WOULD IMPACT ITS RESTRICTIVE THINGS VARIOUS SECTORS AND ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE HELLO TO ALLOW RE OPENING OF ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESSES AFTER THE STAY AT HOME ORDER THAT STARTED IN MARCH IN IN JULY EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA IS COLOR CODED AND BASED ON A RADIO TEST POSITIVITY IS THAT THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE TESTS OVER ALL THE TESTS THAT ARE DONE TEST POSITIVITY AND CASE RATES SO THE CASE RATE IS ESSENTIALLY THE NUMBER OF CASES IN EACH COUNTY DEVIDED BY IT'S A PER CAPITA NUMBER AND THEN THERE ISN'T JUSTICE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE PER DAY SO THE CASE RATE OF PEOPLE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY AND THEN WE JUST NOT PROTESTING VOLUME AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE COUNTIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CONTINUE TO TEST AND DO WHAT WE CALL CASE FINDING AND YOU FIND MORE CASES ARE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR CASE RIGHT SO AS COUNTIES ARE DOING A LOT OF TESTING WE HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THAT TO ALLOW FOR THAT AN INCREASE IN TESTING SO THE OVERALL GOALS AGAIN OR TO CONTINUE TO AGAIN SLOWLY AND STRINGENTLY ALLOW THE THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO MAINTAIN A REDUCE TRANSMISSION SO AS MENTIONED YOU KNOW OUR WINTER IS COMING I TALK ABOUT THE SECTORS THAT ARE ALLOWED OR NOT ALLOWED ARE UP -- IT'S SAFER TO HAVE THINGS OUTDOORS WITH THIS VIRUS BUT WE KNOW THAT SOON WILL BE FORCED TO DO MORE THINGS INDOORS AND JUST THAT'S A NATURAL THING TO DO AND OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES WITH THE RECENT WILDFIRES AND AIR QUALITY IN HEAT -- AND AGAIN THE IMPACT IS TO SEASON TYPICALLY WILL STRESS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM EVEN JUST FLEW A LOAN WITH A BAD FLU SEASON CAN REALLY STRESS OUR SYSTEM AND WE'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A POTENTIAL TO ENDEMIC OR HAVE FLU AND CO THE NINETEEN CASES FILLING OUR HOSPITALS THIS WINTER SO BI LINE IS PHASED IN RE OPENING THAT HAS VARIOUS CHANGES IN SECTORS AND THINKING ABOUT THAT SECTOR'S POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO DISEASE TRANSMISSION WE CAME UP WITH THIS FRAMEWORK TO -- HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS FOR COUNTIES AND BENCHMARKS THAT THEY COULD SEE TO ACHIEVE TO MOVE FORWARD SO AGAIN THE BENCHMARK HAS WE MOVE FROM WIDESPREAD JUST THE PURPLE TIER TWO SUBSTANTIAL JUST THE RED TIER TRANSMISSION AND THEN MODERATE IS ORANGE AND MINIMAL IS YELLOW AND EACH COUNTY AGAIN WAS A SIGN ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST ONE OF THOSE COLORS BASED ON THE THE CASE REYES AND SEVENTY IN EACH COUNTY AND -- I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT OF COURSE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE AND WE ALL LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF THIS PANDEMIC A LOT OF THE LEARNING WE'VE DONE WAS PUT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK AND AS THINGS OF ALL WILL CONTINUE TO REASSESS THESE METRICS AND THRESHOLDS WITH THE DATA WE HAVE BOTH IN THE STATE AND LOOKING NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLY SO WHAT THIS RUMOR DID WAS REPLACE THE PREVIOUS COUNTY DATA MONITORING THIS WHICH WAS REALLY AN HONOR OFFICE HE COUNTY'S READER ON THE LIST ARE OFF THE LIST AND THEN MANY THINGS WERE EVEN OPEN OR CLOSED SO WE REALLY WANT TO COME OUT WITH A PAYMENT AGAIN THAT HAS TEARS AND PHASES OF PEOPLE COULD SORT OF SLOWLY AND SAFELY MARCHED THROUGH THEM AND ALSO THE DIFFERENT SECTORS POTENTIALLY START TO OPEN CAREFULLY AT A SMALLER CAPACITY OR START OUTDOORS AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVED INDOORS YOU'LL SEE THAT THEME AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WHAT'S ALLOWED IN DIFFERENT SECTORS AND DIFFERENT TIERS AS OF SUIT AGAINST KIND OF REVIEW THE RULES OF THIS REMARK SO AGAIN WE ASSIGNED ALL THE COUNTIES TO IT HERE ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST AND WHAT WE LOOKED AT WAS -- WE LOOKED AT SEVEN DAY CASE REYES AND SEVENTY TEST POSITIVITY AND WE LOOK AT THOSE WITH THE SEVEN DAY LAG BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THAT'S DEFINITELY IMPROVED OUR TURNAROUND TIME NOW THE STATE IS AN AVERAGE OF ONE POINT TWO DAYS BUT IT DOES TAKE TIME BETWEEN THE TIME THE PERSON IS TESTED THE TEST RESULTS COME AND THAT WE RECEIVE THAT DATA AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO WE GET THE MOST ACCURATE TIME DELAYS IN GETTING THE TEST RESULTS BUT ALSO NOT BEING TO BEHIND AND LOOKING AT OUR TRENDS THAT THE SEVEN DAY LACKS -- WE LOOK AT THOSE WEEKLY WE RUN A DATA EVERY MONDAY AND THEN WE LET THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NO ON MONDAY AFTERNOON TO GET A BARGAIN LIST OF WHERE THEY'RE SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE AND THEN ON TUESDAYS SO AT NOON TODAY WILL BE ANNOUNCING WHERE THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO MOVE TO SO SOME OF THE OTHER BASELINE RULES ARE AGAIN AS IN THE SPIRIT OF MOVING SLOWLY EVERY COUNTING IS V. AND A CERTAIN TEAR FOR AT LEAST THREE WEEKS SO AGAIN IDEAS AND YOU LOOK AT MODELING OF THE IMPACT OF OPENING THINGS OR ARE PEOPLE INTERACTING MORE AND MIXING MORE IT TAKES TYPICALLY TWO TO FOUR WEEKS TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT BASED ON THE COMMISSION PARENT OF THIS VIRUS SO AGAIN THE RULES EVERY COUNTY HAS TO BE IN A PHASE FOR THREE WEEKS -- ALSO THE COUNTY SAY YOU'RE IN PURPLE AND YEAR TESTING POSITIVITY IN YOUR CASE RATE IMPROVE VERY QUICKLY HERE SOMEHOW AN ORANGE YOU CANNOT SKIP RIGHT YOU STILL HAVE TO GO NEXT TO RED HAT TO BE THREE WEEKS AND READ BEFORE YOU CAN DO SO AGAIN WE WANT TO DO THIS SAFELY SLOWLY AND ALSO THE OTHER RULES ARE THAT IF THE COUNTY HAS AGAIN SAY YOU'RE IN PURPLE AND THEN AND READ BUT YOU'RE TO HIS GREATEST ON PURPLE YOU STILL REMAIN AT THE MORE RESTRICTIVE COLOR CODE THANK YOU DON'T YOU CAN HAVE A TO RENTAL BOTH YOUR CASE RATE AND A TEST POSITIVE HERE AND LESS RESTRICTIVE TEAR DURING THE WEEKLY SAY ASSESSMENTS -- WE LOOK AT AGAIN LOOK AT THE THE PRIOR WEEK AND THE WEEK BEFORE SO IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER THREE WEEKS YOU HAVE TO MEET TWO WEEKS OF CRITERIA OF BEING THE LESS RESTRICTIVE HERE SO IF YOU'RE IN PURPLE NOW THAT LAST WEEK YOU MIGHT READ IT AND WEEP FOR YOU THAT RIGHT THEN YOU CAN GO CHECK THAT TODAY SO THAT'S AGAIN SO YOU HAVE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR THREE WEEKS BUT THEN IN ORDER TO SHOW YOUR PROGRESS AND STABLE PROGRESS YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR COUNTY IS GOTTEN BETTER METRICS FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE YOU CAN AFFORD INTO THAT TEXTURES AT TIER -- AND THEN IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT AND AS A FORMAL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL MYSELF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STILL OF COURSE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE STRICTER THAN THE STATE IF THEY CHOOSE TO SO WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THE STATE CAN ALLOW AND IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY CHOOSE TO BE STRICTER SO IT'S JUST IMPORTANT FOR OUR CITIZENS ALL SO ANOTHER COMMON QUESTION IS ABOUT HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHETHER SECTOR IS LOW MEDIUM OR HIGH RISK AND WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK ABOUT WE DO THIS SO THE ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE FACE COVERINGS ARE WEARING MASKS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT'S WHERE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE EATING OR DRINKING AS A HIGHER REST BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BE WEARING YOUR FACE COVERINGS AVAILABILITY TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS THE ABILITY TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER SQUARE FOOT SO AGAIN THE FOR THEIR PART PEOPLE AREN'T THE SAFER THE ABILITY TO NUMBER ON THE WAY TO LIMIT THE DURATION OF EXPOSURE SO LONGER EXPOSURES ARE CERTAINLY HIGHER RISKS OR EXPOSURES GOING TO THE STORE BRIEFLY AND RUNNING IN GETTING SOMETHING COMING HOME IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SITTING IN A TWO HOUR EVENT AND THE ABILITY OF COURSE ABOUT MIXING YOU WANT TO REALLY MINIMIZE MIXING PEOPLE ACROSS AND HOUSEHOLDS AND CERTAINLY ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THAT ALL WITH OTHERS AND THEN FINALLY SEVEN LEARNED AGAIN MORE AND MORE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF THIS VIRUS BEING TRANSMITTED TO PEOPLE INDOORS AND VENTILATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS WHY VERY EARLY ON WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF FLIGHTS FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION IT'S MOSTLY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALLOWED AND NOT AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY INCREASE SPREAD OR THINGS LIKE SINGING SHOUTING HEAVY BREATHING SO WHEN YOU'RE EXERCISING -- AND THEN IF YOU'RE IN ALLOWED ENVIRONMENT IT NEEDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RAISING YOUR VOICE OR SHOUTING WHICH AGAIN COULD PROPEL THE DISEASE FURTHER AND IS HIGHER RISK SETTING -- AND THEN YOU'LL HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT THE THE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM BUT JUST BRIEFLY THE WAY IT WORKS IS THERE ARE OVER EIGHTY MANDATED REPORTABLE DISEASES TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY CLINICIANS AND A SHORT LIST OF THOSE RELAPSE AND CODE NINETEEN CERTAINLY PART OF A BOOK BY CLINICIANS AND LAB SO WE RECEIVE THAT DATA AND A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS WE HAVE ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTING NOW COMES IN TO RECOVER THE SYSTEM WHICH MY COLLEAGUE WILL BE EXPANDING FURTHER TO YOU AND THEN THE -- CLINICIANS REPORT CASES ALSO TO LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AND THEY ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM THAT ALSO GOES TO OUR STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN WE JUST -- WE CALCULATE THOSE ADJUSTED KEY STREETS AND TEST POSITIVITY AS I WAS EXPLAINING QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO COVER IS HOW DOES THIS AFFECT SCHOOLS SO WHEN WE TRANSITION TO THIS BLUEPRINT WE WANTED TO MINIMIZE ANY CHANGES WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DECLARED ABOUT THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS AND SO THE PURPLE TEAR WAS BASICALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE -- THRESHOLDS FOR THE COUNTY DATA MINING LIST SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND WE IT'S NOT ALREADY THAT SCHOOLS COULD BE OPEN ONCE THEY WERE TWO WEEKS OFF AT THE DATA MODERN LIST SO THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT IS ONCE THEY'RE IN THE RED TERROR AND OUT OF THE PURPLE TOUR FOR TWO WEEKS OR MORE SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN SO THAT IS -- AS YOU CAN SEE ACROSS THE STATE WHAT IS GRADUALLY HAPPENING AS WELL ONE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN IN THE RED HERE IF THEY'RE COUNTY WAS BACK INTO THE PURPLE TEAR IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY NEED TO CLOSE I THINK THERE MAY BE INCREASED VIGILANCE OF COURSE AND -- INCREASE POTENTIALLY INCREASE TESTING -- IN THAT SETTING BUT WE'VE RECOGNIZE THE DESTRUCTION OF REAL OPENING AND CLOSING AND WE REALLY WANT TO MINIMIZE AGAIN AND SORT OF FLY THERE SOMEBODY PRINCIPLES THAT TAKING TIME FOR THERE'S MOVEMENT SO THEY'RE NOT KIND OF HAVING A WITH LACKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT TIERS FINALLY THERE'S A COUNTY DATA EDUCATION PROCESS WHICH WE ARE FINALIZING WITH THE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PARTNERS ARE CAN HELP EXECUTIVES GROUP AND OUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS ORGANIZATION TO DEVELOP AN ADJUDICATION PROCESS OF THAT IF I COUNTY YOU KNOW AND BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT IF THERE ARE ANY DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE DATA AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SEEING ON THE GROUND -- AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE WANNA CERTAINLY DISCREPANCIES IN THE ACTUAL DATA AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SOME CONTEXTUAL IMPORTANCE ABOUT SO ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE SMALL COUNTIES THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE MAYBE ONE LARGE AFRICAN ONE LARGE FAMILY CLUSTER REALLY CHANGES THEIR TEST POSITIVITY RATHER CASE RIGHT SO THINGS LIKE THAT ARE A LARGE OUTBREAK THAT REALLY IS CONTAINED -- THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT FEELS COMFORTABLE THAT IT'S ON THE RIGHT TRENDS THAT THEY THEY COME TO US AND SAY WOULD LIKE AN EDUCATION TO DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT THIS THIS HAS IMPACTED OUR METRICS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE -- YOU KNOW EITHER MORE TIME OF POTENTIALLY OR MORE CONSIDERATION ABOUT WHY WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEXT YEAR SO WE'RE FORMALIZING THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD SOME INFORMAL -- SITUATIONS OVER OUR FIRST FEW WEEKS AND WE'RE FORMALIZING THAT SHOULD BE FINALIZED THIS WEEKEND POSTED -- THERE'S MORE DETAILS ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT HOW THESE METRICS ARE CALCULATED AND FOR THE PUBLIC AGAIN TO GET THIS INFORMATION EVERY TUESDAY WE UPDATE THE COUNTY MAP ON COVERT NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV AND ANY INDIVIDUAL CAN CATCH UP PENSION THEIR COUNTY AND SEE WHAT THE STATE WILL ALLOW AND THAT COUNTY BASED ON THE DIFFERENT SECTORS CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT IS A LOT THAT THAT THAT'S A NICE AND EASY WAY TO JUST LOOK AT THE MAP AND SEE WHERE WE ARE AS A STATE AND WHAT'S ALLOWED IN YOUR COUNTY SO WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BLACK TO THE TWO KIDS JUST DON'T HAVE ALL THE PANELISTS SPEAKING INTO QUESTIONS AT THE END SHOWS WILL JUST AT THIS POINT JUST MOVED TO SUSAN FANELLI OKAY GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS I'M SUSAN VALLEY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF

FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EACH FOR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IF YOU'RE IN THE ROOM FOR SOME REASON IT'S NOT COMING I THINK IF TO START TALKING TO CAN YOU SEE ME AGAIN NOW YES THANK YOU I'M SURE AND CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION SORRY ABSOLUTELY SO HOW ARE THE MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS LAST FACILITIES SHARING AND TRACKING TESTING RESULTS SO BASICALLY ALL HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN A LABORATORY TEST RESULTS ARE SUBMITTED TO -- ALL LABS ARE ACTUALLY MANDATED TO REPORT THAT DATA TO US THROUGH OUR ELECTRONIC LAB CELESTINO SO WAS CALIFORNIA USING PAPER RECORDS WE ARE WORKING VERY ACTIVELY ON I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S GONNA FALL THIS THESE POINT OF CARE WILL BE HIGH ANTIGEN TESTING AND THOSE ARE POINT OF CARE THEY DON'T HAVE AN ELECTRONIC WAY TO DO IT BUT THERE IS A MANDATE ITS TITLE SEVENTEEN SECTION TWENTY FIVE OF AYE WHERE OLIVER TORIES ARE REQUIRED TO DO NOT SO AS NEW LABS ARE COMING ON BOARD SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE FIRST THING THEY -- YOU KNOW I GET A LOT OF WHETHER EVOLVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR ACTUAL LABORATORY TESTING AND THEN THEY REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT TO US AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON DOING THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT CLINICIANS STILL ARE STILL SOMETIMES FAXING OR SOMETIMES LEADS ARE FAXING DATA IS TRUE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ON ALL LEVELS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON IT BUT THE CIRCLING BACK IN THIS DAY AND AGE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE NAVY SHIP MERCY IN OUR CAREER HERE IN SACRAMENTO THESE PAPER FILES WITH ELECTRONIC TRACKING ABILITY IT'S JUST MIND BOGGLING THAT WE AREN'T USING ELECTRONIC RECORDS OR SONY SYSTEMS OUT THERE OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS -- IT JUST SEEMS VERY CUMBERSOME TO HAVE A PAPER SYSTEM HELLO WHY IS THAT WITH WITH SO MANY ITEMS OR SOMEBODY PROGRAMS AVAILABLE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A COMMON QUESTION WE HELLER ARE WANTING TO TO UPDATE OUR RESOURCES COLLECTIVELY BUT I GUESS I'M A PERSON ON THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS NOT I MEAN IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY TO TO GET A SYSTEM LIKE THIS TO DO ELECTRONICALLY SO -- WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE THAT YEAH IT'S REALLY CONNECTING THOSE ON THE HOSPITAL LABS OR OTHER SYSTEMS AND COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN PLEASE YEAH KINSMEN LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO IT'S THE I. T. CONNECTIVITY TO THOSE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND I THINK OUR NEW SYSTEM THE C. C. R. AS SYSTEM THAT WE'RE BUILDING WILL PROVIDE AN EASIER WAY AFTER A LOT FOR -- SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS AND LABS TO CONNECT INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE ARE AWARE OF THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT AS WELL AND WORKING WITH PROVIDERS TO GET THEM AS QUICKLY ON TO THE SYSTEM AS WE CAN SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE YOU KNOW SEVEN MONTHS INTO THIS -- THE NAVY SHIP IS GONE ALLEN ARE KOREANS NOT BEING USED SO HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM -- BRINGING THE TRUCK FILES ON BOARD I THINK FOR THE MOST PART WE DO HAVE A LOT TRAINING FILES IT'S AS NEW LABS ARE NEW HEALTH CARE -- COMES ON BOARD THAT WE HAVE TO GET THEM CONNECTED AND SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM WE THINK IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER WITH AND I'LL HAVE I HAVE R. I. T. FOLKS TALK TO IT BUT ONE OF THE BENEFITS TO THE C. C. R. S. SYSTEM WILL BE AN EASIER WAY TO GET IN SOME OF THESE NO TIMELINE RIGHT NOW THE I'M NOT DEFERRED HER I. T. FOLKS TO ANSWER THAT TIMELINE ON THE RAUNER KERRY THANK YOU MEMBERS APPROPRIATE QUESTION D. TRONIC ABILITY FOR THOSE LAPS OR PROVIDERS THAT HAVE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS TO SUBMIT THOSE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WHEN THE ONE OFF CONTRACTS ARE USED TO EXPAND ON THAT TESTING DONE IN THE STATE THAT SAME MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT THEY SUBMIT INTO THE STATEWIDE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SYSTEM SO THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE THAT ARE USING THIS AT ONE OP TESTING FACILITIES THAT'S THAT'S THEIR OPTION TO UTILIZE NON ELECTRONIC RECORDS BUT BUT OTHER STATES HAVE FOUND WAYS TO HAVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS IN MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF OTHER STATES ARE DOING THAT -- A NEW PUBLIC HEALTH IS A ROBUST IT SYSTEM IF OTHER STATES CAN DO IT SORRY ARE YOU ASKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TEMPORARY HOSPITALS CORRECT HAVE NOT NOT ONLY THAT SECONDARY WILL LOOK INTO THAT WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR -- AND WILL I THINK THAT I COULD DO THE QUESTION AGAIN OUR MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL FACILITY SHARING AND TRACKING TEST RESULTS OKAY SO YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH I MEAN YOU'RE CORRECT WE HAVE BEEN USING AND A FEW HOSPITALS THAT WE SET UP IN MAKESHIFT WAY I'M SO WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AS A CONSIDERATION AND EXPLORE WHAT SOME OTHER OPTIONS ARE FOR THOSE ARCO ARENA TYPE -- SITUATION SORRY WE WERE ADDRESSING THE BIGGER QUESTION WITH SOME OF THE LABS AS THEY COME ON BOARD AND GETTING THEM INTO THE LOCK PRODUCTS SYSTEM UNDERSTUDY MAKESHIFT AND OBVIOUSLY OTHER STATES ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW WITH MAKESHIFT WERE SELECT WHAT EXETER IF WE DO THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT OKAY WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AND I THINK YOU THANK YOU MR FONG I THINK THIS CHAIR THIS QUESTION MADE THE FOR SUSAN OR FOR DR PAM BUT IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE THE PATH FOR COUNTIES AND CITIES TO MOVE THROUGH THE BLUEPRINT FROM TIER TO TIER IS BASED ON THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IN THE CAR READY SYSTEM A WEEK IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT THE BASIS OF THE DATA THAT IS CORRECT AND THAT DOT ALONG WITH ANY ADJUDICATION AND ANY WORK THAT WE DO WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IF THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE DATA THAT IS NOT WELL REFLECTED AND CAL READY SO WE HAVE AS ERICA DESCRIBE WE HAVE AT AND EDUCATION PROCESS WE HAVE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT DON'T USE THE CAL READY SYSTEM IN THE SAME WAY I'M SO WE WORK WITH UP ON BOTH SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES SO THEN GIVE IT SO THEN IS CAL READY SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN REAL TIME AS IF IF THE IF THE BLUEPRINT IS IS IS BASED ON THE DATA SYSTEMS OR THE DATA PROVIDING THE COVERAGE SYSTEM IS CAL READY SUPPOSED TO BE OPERATING IN A REAL TIME BASIS I THINK AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME AS WE CAN GET IT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE LAGS IN TERMS OF LABORATORY PURPORTING INTO ANY AND SO WHAT WE USE IN THE BLUEPRINT AS THAT SEVEN DAY LAG BECAUSE WE KNOW AS CASES ARE REPORTED THEY GET BANNED I TOOK IT BACK TO THE CORRECT DATE -- AND SO WE USE THAT SEVEN DAY LAG TO BE AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION AS WE CAN BE OKAY THEN I GUESS GOING BACK TO THE JULY TWENTY FIFTH -- I AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF GLOSSED OVER BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND CORRECT ME IF I GIVE MY IF MY UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED IS INCORRECT BUT THAT THE SYSTEM TO CARRY SYSTEM WAS NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF DATA AS YOU INDICATED AND SO THROUGH SOME CHECK IT WAS SEEN THAT THE CAVITY SYSTEM WASN'T OPERATING AT FULL CAPACITY IN WHICH CASE THE SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN IS THAT CORRECT AND THEN I I'M NOT SCARED TO INSPECT THE SYSTEM DID GAP GO DOWN ON JULY TWENTY FIFTH AND WAS LATER BROUGHT BACK UP IN AUGUST GARY TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS OF WHY THE SYSTEM WENT DOWN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH -- SO IT WAS SORT OF A COMBINATION OF EVENTS THAT HAPPEN -- WITH A LARGE VOLUME MESSAGES COMING INTO THE FRONT END OF OUR -- WAS A LARGE VOLUMES AND A LOT OF DUPLICATES AT THAT WERE FLOWING THROUGH TO THE CARRY SYSTEM -- THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS WITHIN THE CAO READY SYSTEM IN A STARTED TO BACK UP SO WE OKAY SO I WILL GO AGAIN IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OUT BUT IT YET THESE DUPLICATE MESSAGES BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG OKAY SO THEN ONCE YOU DISCOVERED THE THE THE GLITCH I GUESS IS WHAT WE'RE IT WAS BEING REFERRED TO THEN THE SYSTEM WAS TAKEN DOWN OR TO ADDRESS A DUPLICATION OR WAS IT AS A SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT BACK ON AFTER THE GLITCH WAS WAS ADDRESS THEN THE DUPLICATIONS BECAME A PROBLEM IN WHICH CASE THAT HAD TO BE ADDRESSED IS THAT CORRECT YES YES WE STARTED DRESS IT AT THE AT THE GATEWAY WHICH IS IN FRONT OF HOW READY AND -- WE MADE SOME CHANGES TO REDUCE THE DUPLICATION WHICH AT SIDE EFFECTS THEMSELVES AND THEN -- THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THE GATEWAY AND THEN WE STARTED WORKING ON HOW COULD WE FIX THOSE PROBLEMS SEVERAL EIGHT SO THAT THOSE ARE THE TEMPORARY FIX THAT WAS USED TO ADDRESS IT TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT ENDED UP SLOWING DOWN THE SYSTEM AND SAID THAT TEMPORARY FIX WAS REMOVED TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM AND THEN TO DUPLICATION PROCESS WAS REINSTALLED IS ACTUALLY YES YEAH RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY AND THEN WE PULL SOME OF THOSE DUPLICATE MESSAGES OFF FROM BEING PROCESSED AND I DO MAINLY PROCESS THEM AND MESSAGES GETTING IN THE CAR READY SO UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT WE'RE ALL OPERATING ON THE SAME LIKE SCENARIO WHAT HAPPENED THEN I GUESS WHAT WAS THEN TAKEN WHAT ACTIONS WERE THEN TAKEN TO TO FIX THIS BECAUSE IS IT IS IT IS THERE A LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN -- WHAT WHAT VERY WHAT WAS DONE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN SO A NUMBER OF THINGS -- WE'RE DONE AGAIN AND -- WE STARTED THOSE IN EARLY AUGUST LATE JULY EARLY AUGUST AND WE STARTED TECHNOLOGY AND YOU HEARD RUN ROBINETTE WE PUT -- -- TIGER TEAMS TOGETHER TO WORK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WE LOOKED AT STABILIZING BOTH THE HIV GATEWAY PROCESSING THE MESSAGES AND IMPROVING THE THE RELIABILITY OF THAT SYSTEM BY ADDING MORE HARDWARE -- IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE BRINGING THE BAND MORE VENDORS ON BOARD THAT HAD MORE SKILLS AND WE HAD TO ACTUALLY CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM APPROPRIATELY -- -- TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT FROM WHAT IT'S BEEN OVER THE LAST YEARS OF THAT HAD A DOWNSTREAM IMPACT ON HOW READY IT MADE IT EASIER FOR CARRIED A PROCESS REAL MESSAGES BUT HE WITH THE INCREASING VOLUME CAL READY WAS STILL HAVING A BACKLOG IN REAL MESSAGES WE SPENT A NUMBER OF THE SAME TEAM FOCUSED ON IMPROVEMENTS TO CAL READY -- AS RON ROBINETTE SAID FROM C. T. WE FOUND SOME PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENTS IN THE SEQUEL DATABASE WHICH INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE ALMOST SIX TIMES SO -- WE'VE IMPROVED THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS WE'VE M. PROVED BRINGING MORE SKILL SETS ON BALL FROM THE VENDORS -- EAF -- WE'VE ADDED MORE SIGNIFICANT AND STUFF THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY STABILIZE THE SYSTEM -- AS OF WITHIN THE LAST PROBABLY SIX WEEKS WE'VE HAD NO ONE PLANNED DOWNTIME AND WE HAVE ZERO BACKLOGS DAY IN AND DAY OUT ON CAL READY -- WE HAVE OUR LEAD MESSAGE DID JUST -- JEWS COMING IN THE CAR READY NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY'RE ZERO AND WE ARE PREFERRED FOR A PER PROCESSING WE EVER HAVE PROBABLY EIGHTY THOUSAND AND THAT CONTINUES TO GROW AS THE VOLUME GROWTH THE FRONT IN HIV GATEWAY SYSTEM HAS PROP -- WITH IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE TO THAT HAS -- AS SHE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MESSAGES WE'VE EVEN HAD IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO THREE HUNDRED A DAY TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND WE'VE HAD NO GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEM SO ALL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE ON THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT -- HAVE PROVED TO BE VERY STABILIZING AND -- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR AND STAY AHEAD OF THE GAME AND AND YOU'D INDICATED THAT THE THAT THE SYSTEM IS TESTED EACH DAY OR DALY WHAT WE DO EACH DAY IF WE HAVE A SEPARATE -- -- AT ALL THE MESSAGES -- THIS INDEPENDENT RUN BY THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY AND GIVES US THE TOTAL COUNTS OF MESSAGES COMING IN AND THEN IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEMS THE THE GATEWAY COUNTS ALL THOSE MESSAGES AND AND WE RELATE BACK TO THIS INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS AND AS THEY GO INTO CAL READY TO BE PROCESS WE ALSO COMPARED NUMBERS AND METRICS EVERY SINGLE DAY WE ALSO COMPARE METRICS WITH LA AND SAN DIEGO AND SO IF THERE ARE ANY DISCREPANCIES FOR ANY REASON WE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY WHERE THEY ARE AND WE'RE ABLE TO WORK ON VERY QUICKLY TO RESOLVE THEM OKAY AND AND THEN I GUESS MAYBE YOU OR DOCTOR BANNER OUR DEMOCRACY PH HOW DOES THAT SO I'VE I'VE KIND OF HEARD THREE SYSTEMS AS THE EXISTING CAR READY SYSTEM THERE'S IS NAY C. C. R. S. SYSTEM AND THEN THERE IS A NEED FOR A A. B. A NEW CAR READY SYSTEM IN THERE -- SO HOW DO THEY ALL HAD AT LEAST MY FIRST QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE EXISTING COVERAGE SYSTEM AND THIS NEW C. C. R. S. SYSTEM HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER YOU COULD HAVE ORDERED THE OTHER TWO SYSTEMS OR WIND JUST FOR CALL OF IT AND THE OTHER ONES FOR TWELVE AND PLUS EVERYTHING ELSE NO THIS IS YOUR SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE ELECTRONIC LAB RECORDS COMING IN -- OFTEN HAS A LOT OF SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA SO ULTIMATELY THE NEW SYSTEMC HARASSED WILL PROCESS ALL THE INCOMING MESSAGES AND WE EXPECT THEM TO GO TO THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND A DAY TO REMOVE THE DUPES CHECK FOR QUALITY ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE MESSAGE AND AND THEN SEND THAT GOOD QUALITY MESSAGES ON TO OUR HIV GATEWAY AND THEN WE WILL ROUTE THEM THROUGH OUT HOW READY LA AND SAN DIEGO -- SO THAT OFFLOAD SOME OF THE -- LAB PROCESSING OFF OF OUR H. I. GATEWAY THE SECOND SIGNIFICANT PART OF C. C. R. S. IS THE COLBERT REPORT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO COPE WITH AND THAT IN ITSELF BUILDING A REPORTING SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO DALY PROVIDE THE GOVERNORSHIP AND -- IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME AND A MORE RELIABLE -- BEFORE THEIR WORK THEY HAD TO CONSUME EVERY DAY LOTS OF DATA -- THAT WAS GROWING EVERY DAY THIS WILL PUT IT ALL INTO ONE REPORTING DATABASE AND THEY SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AT GENERATING THOSE METRICS SO THEN THE THE WAY THE PROCESS IS NOW OR AT LEAST WE ARE NOT NOW BUT WHEN THIS WEDNESDAY'S ARREST COMES ONLINE IS THAT ALL THE DATA ALL THE LAB DATA ALL THE LAB RESULTS AND ALL THE RESULTS BEING COLLECTED IN THE STATE THAT WOULD BE SENT TO THE C. C. R. S. SYSTEM FIRST AND THEN THAT WILL BE REVIEWED AND THEN IT WOULD BE THEN SENT TO THE CAL READY SYSTEM FOR THAT TO BE UP LOADED -- FOR EVERYONE TO ACCESS THAT THAT'S CORRECT -- IT TOO WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED LAPS THAT REPORT DIRECTLY INTO THE CDPH GATEWAY AND THOSE OVER TIME MONTHS WILL SLOWLY BE MOVED ON TO THE OPTIM SYSTEM TO SEE IF YOUR SYSTEM AND THAT WILL OFF LOADED AND IT WILL BE DIRECTLY HE TO THEM NOW WITH WHAT THE NEW CAR READY SYSTEM BE CREATED OFF THE FOUNDATION OF THE CRS OR IS IT OR THEY'RE GOING TO ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO CREATE A BRAND NEW CAR READY UP ON ITS OWN SO -- -- SO IT'S MORE A DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ANSWER SURVEILLANCE AND -- WE WE ARE WORKING WITH A CONTRACTOR WHO'S LOOKING AT -- WHAT WHAT THE FUTURE BE WHAT'S THE ROAD MAP FOR A COUPLE YEARS OUT -- THERE ARE INTERVIEWING MANY STAKEHOLDERS -- COUNTIES CDPH AGENCY CDT TO SEE WHAT THEIR VISIONS ARE THEY'RE LOOKING AT NEWER TECHNOLOGIES THEY ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE FOR THE FUTURE OF LOOKING AT -- CDC FOR ANY ANY IDEAS AND SYSTEMS THEY HAVE SO WE'RE JUST AT THE EARLY STAGES OF OF AND WHAT TYPE OF SYSTEM WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FUTURE INCLUDING PROBABLY THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS A LOT BECAUSE THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY THE FRONTLINE AND A LOT OF THIS AND -- THEY HAVE THEIR OWN THAT THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEM OKAY BUT THE GOAL IS COMPATIBILITY THOUGH RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THAT DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER NOW WE HAVE TO INTER OPERABILITY IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE TODAY EVERYTHING WE BUILD TODAY THEY THE CONTACT TRACING SYSTEM INTEROPERATES WITH CAL READY AND IT WILL INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS TRACING DATA -- AND CAL READY AS INTER OPERATING THAT WAY ALSO THE NEW CCRI SYSTEM INTEROPERATES WITH OUR GATEWAY SO EVERYTHING THAT WE LOOK AT TODAY IS REALLY CONNECTED IN MY OR ANOTHER AND WE'RE USING INTER OPERABILITY SOFTWARE TO MAKE IT EASIER AND FASTER TO DELIVER THOSE OKAY AND AFTER JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY BIG I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION ON CAL READY AND ON THIS NEWS THE SEWER SYSTEM BUT HOW MANY DATABASES DOES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE SHE WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED APPLICATIONS WE PROBABLY HAVE -- YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF DATABASES FROM ACCESS TO SEQUEL TO ORACLE -- WE HAVE VERY LARGE DATABASES DRIVING OUR LARGE SYSTEMS AND THEN WE HAVE SMALLER DATABASES FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAM AREAS OKAY SO I GUESS I ME I JUST HAVE A NUMBER BUT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AT LEAST ON THE CALVET -- THE CAR READY SYSTEM SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HELP DESK WHICH THE USERS AND PROVIDERS -- UTILIZE DOWN -- THEY SAID ON ITS PHONE SERVICE AND MOVED TO AN EMAIL ONLY SERVICE AND I I'VE HEARD THIS FROM MY OWN DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE OF THIS RESPONSES TO TIME SENSITIVE ISSUES ARE RELATIVELY SLOW COMMENT ON THAT AND ARE YOU WORKING TO INCREASE RESPONSE TIMES TO THE HELP DESK -- ESPECIALLY WHEN AS IT INDICATED EARLIER WE NEED AS REAL TIME AS POSSIBLE AND AS THE DATA IS SO IMPORTANT -- KICKED THE CAN YOU COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT CHAU AYE I CAN'T ADDRESS THAT I CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY CARRY PROGRAM IT'S PROBABLY THEIR HELP DESK NOT AN I. T. HELP DESK CHANGES BUT -- I CERTAINLY CAN LOOK INTO IT AND SEE YOU KNOW WHY THAT WAS HAPPENING OKAY AND AS A FOLLOW UP THEM AND MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GIVE LIMITED A MINUTE AT ADMIN RIGHTS TO TO THE COVERAGE SYSTEM TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COUNTY LEVEL WITHIN CAL WITH WITH WITH IN EACH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES COUNTY SO THAT THERE'S SOME RESEARCH THAT SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE SOME ACCESS TO THEY CAN ACTUALLY UPLOAD THE DATA QUICKER MAYBE THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO SIX YES AN ENHANCED PRIVILEGES TO HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO DATA WITHIN WITHIN THE CARRY DATA WAREHOUSE SO WE HAVE A DATA WAREHOUSE EVERY DAY THAT WE POPULATE WITH THE CURRENT DATA AND THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL THE COUNTIES THROUGH ARE A WEB BASED INTERFACE -- AND -- WE ARE LOOKING AT MAKING HIM THAT IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THAT THAT IS NOT JUST GO WITH THAT SCHOOL THAT IN EVERYTHING SO I WILL LOOK AT WHAT THAT REQUIRE SEE SEE WHAT IT WHAT WHAT IT WHAT ENHANCE PRIVILEGES WILL OFFERS THE COUNTY SAN ACCESS TO THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THEN OF COURSE EVEN PRIOR TO THE DATE A GLITCH CAL READY PRESENTED AND STILL DOES PRESENT SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN TERMS OF I RECEIVED REPORTS OF COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN REGISTERING NEW USERS AND PROVIDERS TO HAVE READY WITH SOME PROVIDERS WAITING WEEKS TO HAVE THEIR REGISTRATION APPROVED AS AS AT ANY COULD BEFORE WE DON'T WANT ANY DELAYS IN THE DATA -- IS THERE A PLAN IN PLACE TO MAKE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT -- OR SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS I OTHER TEAM AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT BUT WE WE HAVE TRIED TO INCREASE THAT PROTECT THE RESPONSE TIME AND SO WE DID PUT A TEAM OF PEOPLE -- WHO ARE WORKING ON THAT TO TRY TO GET MORE TIMELY RESPONSES BACK TO PEOPLE BUT WILL DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT AND WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT WHETHER WE CAN RESTORE ON THAT PHONE LINE IN ADDITION TO THE EMAIL ACCOUNT OKAY DEBBIE I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY AS WE NEED MORE TIMELY INFORMATION -- AND THEN OF COURSE SUCH A MEDIC ALREADY USERS -- ARE FRUSTRATED SOME OF THE SYSTEMS LESS THAN USER FRIENDLY FEATURES -- DIFFICULT IS SURGING MORE THAN ONE SINGLE DEMOGRAPHIC -- STOP POSSIBLE SEARCH MULTIPLE FIELDS OR TO QUICKLY FILTER A SEARCH BY OTHER FIELDS -- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE DATA DISTRIBUTION PORTALS ARE IN TERMS OF THE USE OF FLAT FILES MAKES DATA PROCESSING MORE DIFFICULT -- ARE THOSE TEACHERS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED -- MOVING FORWARD -- IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE C. SIERRA SYSTEM OR WERE IN THE EXISTING PROPERTY SYSTEM MANY OF THOSE FEATURES WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE BUILDING OF THE NEW SYSTEM ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE DOING EXTENSIVE USER OUTREACH IS TO GET OUT THOSE ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE BUILD THE SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE -- VERY MEANINGFUL REQUEST FROM OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND PROVIDERS OKAY BUT I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AS WELL AS -- GIVING SOME LIMITED ADMIN ACCESS THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL I THINK TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS TO THE I GUESS MAYBE THIS QUESTIONS REGARD FOR DR PAN AM I GUESS MOVING TO THE BLUEPRINT AND -- CAN CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THE HOSPITAL CAPACITY METRIC WAS REMOVED FROM THE BLUEPRINT AND WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT DECISION SURE YEAH I KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU YET -- SO WE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON LEADING INDICATORS RIGHT ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE FOCUS OF THE BOOK WAS A SLOW INTERNET RE OPENING STILL WATCHING ALL OF THE HOSPITAL AFTER EXPECTING AND THAT WAS WHY WE HAD A A PRESS EVENT ON FRIDAY TO REALLY TELL EVERYONE THAT WE ARE SEEING THIS PLATEAUING HOSPITALIZATIONS AND IN FACT IF YOU REGION MAYBE A LITTLE BIT AN UPTICK WE WATCH THE PERCENT OF ICE YOU CLASSES EVERY DAY WE ARE SO LONG AS CLOSELY AS ARE THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT WE REALLY FOR THE BLUEPRINT WANTED TO TRY TO SIMPLIFY THINGS A BIT MORE I THINK EVEN WITH THAT I THINK WE THOUGHT OF THE REALLY SIMPLE AND NOW YOU KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF EXPLANATION OF EVERY RULE AND EVERY MOVEMENT SO WE WANTED TO KIND OF GET IT DOWN TO JUST THE BASICS WHICH WAS CASE RATES TEST POSITIVE IT'S AN EASY AND SORT OF SOME OF THE NATIONAL RENDERERS ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATE NOT A NATIONAL STANDARD FOR THE DIFFERENT TIERS KIND OF DATA THAT WE LOOK AT FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION AS A LEADING INDICATOR WE KNOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE -- AS FAR AS THE DISEASE RELIGION ARE LAGGING INDICATOR TYPICALLY TAKES THREE WEEKS OR SO AFTER YOUR CASE RATES GO UP THEIR HOUSES AND GO TO THE ONE ON TOP OF THAT CERTAINLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT AT LOOKING AT ALL THESE THINGS AND IF THE CASE RATE INCREASES QUICKLY -- OR WERE CONCERNED AND AGAIN WE'RE WATCHING ALL THIS HOSPITAL METRICS VERY CLOSELY WE'RE DOING PROJECTIONS WITH -- CAL CAT WHICH YOU CAN ALSO GET AND ONLINE AND THEN WE HIGHLIGHTED THIS I'M OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS PROJECTIONS ABOUT HOW SUFFICIENT AND WE COULD INTERVENE SOONER WE HAVE SAID RIGHT NOW THAT TO MOVE BACKWARDS -- I COUNTY WOULD NEED TO KIND OF BE AND NOT MORE RESTRICTIVE TEARS OF THEIR READ THAT THEIR METRIC START TO LOOK MORE PURPLE -- OVER TWO WEEKS -- THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT BACKGROUND BUT WE'RE ALSO REALLY AGAIN CLOSING MINUS HOSPITAL METRICS WEALTH BURKE AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHETHER FLU SURVEILLANCE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL OKAY WELL I MEAN I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR SIMPLIFICATION BUT ALSO WE WE WANT WE WANT TO PRIVATIZE ACCURACY TO ESPECIALLY THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES SO -- WELL I KNOW YOU'RE MOVING TO ANY OF THE BLUEPRINT IS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE SIMPLE IT IS HI MIKE MY FEAR MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE FULL PICTURE IN EACH COUNTY AND THAT WERE MISSING THINGS BECAUSE THE METRIC WAS REMOVED ESPECIALLY SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS -- HOSPITALIZATIONS BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE FIRST KIND OF STATE HOMELESS TO INSURE THAT WE BENT THE CURVE TO ENSURE HOSPITAL CAPACITY IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS RIGHT AND ALSO JUST TO REDUCE OVERALL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY I THINK I'M OUR DASHBOARDS -- HOW STILL HAVE CONSULTATIONS SO THE METRIC IN THE FRAMEWORK IS LIKE THAT THE HIGHLY THAT EVERYONE'S REALLY OF COURSE THE MOST INTEREST BECAUSE IT DOES IMPACT IT'S GOING TO OPEN OR CLOSED BUT BOTH YOU ADAM AS LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC AND WE I MEAN WE HAVE EVEN MORE DATA BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE'RE NOT SHOWING EVERY SINGLE METRIC THAT WE ARE HONORING THAT OF THAT OUR PUBLIC DASHBOARDS AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET UPDATED AGAIN HOW HOSTAGE OUR THIRTY LOOK AT NEW CONSTELLATIONS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO CARE BECAUSE HAS SEE A FLATTENING HOUSES ASIANS BUT IT'S REALLY JUST PULLING DISCHARGED OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO ACTUALLY IN NEW DATAPOINT WITHOUT IT OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS IS LOOKING AT NEW HOSPITALIZATIONS AS WELL SO WE HAVE THAT ON A SNAPSHOT TOOL THAT WE LOOK AT EVERY DAY AGAIN ON OUR PUBLIC DASHBOARD RIGHT NOW THERE IS OVERALL HOSPITALIZATIONS I SEE YOU AS WE INVOLVED WILL BE ADDING MORE METRICS THAT THE PUBLIC CAN FOLLOW ALONG AS WELL BUT BUT THE HOSPITALIZATION METRIC IS NOT USE FOR IN TERMS OF MOVING COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE TEARS OR IN TERMS OF RE OPENING WITH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE RE EVALUATED IN THE FUTURE CORNELL'S HER AND AGAIN I THINK THE THE THE BECAUSE OF THIS FOR US IS TO THINK ABOUT THE -- THE METRICS ARE MOVING FORWARD AND -- THINK THAT OVERALL DISEASE TRANSMISSION I THINK -- I THINK WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE AND WE CERTAINLY ANNA MORE -- BOTH METRIC AND QUALITATIVE -- LOOKING AT MOVING BACKWARDS OR IF YOU NEED TO REALLY QUICKLY IF YOU START TO SEE YOUR DOUBLING TIME INCREASE YOUR ARE EFFECTIVE INCREASE QUICKLY ENTER HOSTILE SOLUTIONS WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE LAGGING ACTUALLY AND THEN SO IT IS IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE MORE PREEMPTIVELY MORE PREVENTIVE THAN LOOKING WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THAT HOSPITALS SHOULD SEARCH AND LOOK AT THE MODELING SO WE'RE FOLLOWING UP WILL BE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL TO WAIT FOR JUST SIX RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE RELY SOLELY ON IT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT IT'S IT'S AND IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT AND SO IT'S IT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING TO DEMAND TO PUT BACK INTO THE TO THE POINT IF YOU WANT AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EACH COMMUNITY -- IN TERMS OF BE A JUST A CASE WITH A LOT OF COUNTIES KALEEM THE WHENEVER PRESENT -- CLEARLY ARE -- AFFECTED BY THE HSE CASE RATE VERSUS THE ACTUAL CASE RIGHT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT ADJUSTMENT WAS PUT IN SURE YEAH WE -- SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND ACTUALLY CONSULTED WITH NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST EXPERTS -- SOME OF WHOM -- YOU KNOW THE DINO BROWN SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHATEVER THE ODDS THE WORKS THE TIME FREEDOM THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF CDC WE HAVE WORKED WITH OTHERS TO LOOK AT STATE AVERAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WATER BENCHMARKS THAT WE NEED TO DO FOR TESTIFIED TO DO ADEQUATE CASE FINDING TICKETS WILL THIS EPIDEMIC AND PANDEMIC AND SO BY LOOKING AT THAT AGAINST EIGHT HOURS OF TRYING TO ASSESS WATER SORT OF VOLUME TESTING VOLUME THEN TURNS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING ENOUGH KEYS FINDINGS OR NOT AGAIN NOT SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO NOT -- SORT OF -- WE DIDN'T WANT TO CLOSE QUOTE TONNAGE COUNTY IS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF TESTING INDICATES FUNDING BUT FINDING MORE CASES AND THEN HAVING TO HOLD BACK SO -- THROUGH A LOT OF ANALYSIS AGAIN OF STATEWIDE DATA AND NATIONAL DATA WE CAME UP WITH THE LINEAR ADJUSTMENT SO THAT IF YOU'RE TESTING ABOVE AND THERE'S A CAP ON THAT BUT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT IS THE STATE MEDIA WE PICKED UP AND PARKS -- BASICALLY EVERY FOUR WEEKS ABOUT EVERY MONTH TO TO SAY WHAT'S THE MEDIA AND AND IF YOU'RE ABOVE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE YOUR ADJUSTED CASE THAT SAID IF YOU'RE ACTIVELY TESTING FINDING ISOLATING YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET SORT OF -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET HELP BEHIND FOR DOING THAT WORK AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS IF YOU'RE NOT TESTING ENOUGH -- THE PORTION WHERE WHERE YOU'RE MISSING CASES RATED NOTHING MANY MISSING CASES SO THAT'S SORT OF THE THEORY BEHIND IT AND THEN AGAIN A LOT OF WORK ON DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT IT JUST MIGHT AND AGAIN THERE'S A CAP AT THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP OF THAT AND THE MIDDLE IS CONVENIENT AND THEN WORK BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES AS WELL WITH FIRES AND AIR QUALITY SOME OF THE TESTING STATES HAVE BEEN UNAVAILABLE SO THAT'S THE OTHER IMPORTERS AND HAVE THE MEDIA AND NOT JUST A SOLID BENCH MARK THAT IS THE SAME ALL THE TIME I GUESS IT HAVE YOU HEARD THOUGH THAT FROM THE THE NEED FROM FROM MY MY EXPERIENCE IN KERN COUNTY AND ANSWER OTHER MY LET MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING WHEN WE WENT FROM ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TEST SHOULD GET ONE TOO WHEN WE WERE RUNNING SHORT OF AB TESTING KITS THEN IT WAS ONLY SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS -- WERE TO BE TESTED AND NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING A A BLUEPRINT OR A METRIC IN WHICH IT'S TIED TO THE AMOUNT OF TESTING YOU DO BUT NOW WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET TESTED SO THIS PING PONG AND -- IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND IN IN THE PUBLIC HAS CREATED IS NOT NEW DIFFICULTY OF GETTING INDIVIDUALS TO GET TESTED AND NOW THAT'S A KEY COMPONENT FOR ACTUALLY MOVING TO THE TEARS SELL -- MAYBE EVEN ADD SOME PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO GET TESTED IF WE WE'RE KINDA GETTING MIXED MESSAGES SURE I MEAN I GET ON IT KNOWLEDGE I THINK AT ALL LEVELS AGAIN THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE ABOUT WHY TO DO WELL AROUND THIS PANDEMIC ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING CONGRESS IS WELL OVER WHO SHOULD BE TESTED OR NOT AND A LOT OF THAT IS REALLY BACK TO WHAT'S YOUR CAPACITY SO WHEN YOU HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE WHEN YOU HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY WE REALLY THOUGHT OKAY YOU ONLY WANNA DOESN'T NOT PEOPLE THE OTHER REASON THAT MESSAGE INVOLVED AS WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS ABOUT THIS DISEASE AND WE DID NOT REALIZE UNTIL IS ALWAYS HARD FOR ME OF A TIME TO KEEP TRACK OF WHEN WE LEARNED LET THAT YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE NO SYMPTOMS ALSO WE WILL MISS CASES IF WE'RE ONLY TESTING SYSTEMATIC PEOPLE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO PRIORITIZE SO AND WE JUST RECENTLY ALSO IN THE LAST WEEK DID AS TO YOUR POINT CHANGE THAT MESSAGE AGAIN WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY IN THE STATE WERE UNDER UTILIZING ALSO TO YOUR POINT SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A HIGH RISK SETTING -- THAT YOU SHOULD GET TESTED SO WE DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR MESSAGING AROUND THAT AND AGAIN THE THE SCIENCE AROUND THIS INVOLVES AND AND THAT IS WHY OF ALL ISN'T AS WE GET MORE CAPACITY AGAIN I THINK THERE'S MORE AND MORE I'M INTERESTED IN WATER HIKES VALENCE TESTING IN CERTAIN SETTINGS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A HIGH RISK SITUATION BUT ON WHERE YOU CAN GET DIZZY IS THE HIGH RISK OF THE POPULATION OR VISIT IN OPPOSITION THE DALLAS THAT WE WANT THAT TEST SORT OF STAFF THERE YOU KNOW PERIODICALLY AND ACTUALLY WEEKLY IS WHAT'S NEEDED SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY AND TARGET AUDIENCE TO BE STRATEGIC AND I ALSO WANNA AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANT TO BE STRATEGIC ABOUT OUR TESTING IS NOT JUST THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD GET TESTED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HIGH RISK SETTINGS OR CONTINUE TO OF ALL THOSE PRIORITIES AS WE MODIFIER CAPACITY AND THEN THERE'S MORE TESTING TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ON THE HORIZON THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR RISE OF AS BUT AS MORE AS YOU'RE PUSHING MORE MEANS YOU'RE PUSHING COUNTIES TO TEST MORE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TO THE TEARS RIGHT I MEAN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD THE THE UNADJUSTED CASE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE ADDRESS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST COUNTIES UP AND SO THE THE THE COULD IS THERE ENOUGH SUPPLIES OF TEST KITS AND REAGENTS MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT AS COUNTIES BEGIN TO RAMP UP TESTING THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RUN INTO THE SITUATION THAT THEY DID YOU KNOW MONTHS AGO WHERE WE'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TESTS SO CURRENTLY THANKFULLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY SUPPLIES AND SHORTAGES OF SUPPLY OF TEST KITS OR REAGENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT A GUN MOVING FORWARD THAT'S GOING TO BE A PREDICT UNPREDICTABLE BUT THAT'S THERE'S TWO THINGS I THINK TO TO RESPOND TO THAT AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A MEDIAN OF THE STATE WIDE BECAUSE IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT EVERYBODY SO THE MEDIAN IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE LOWER -- IF PEOPLE IF THERE IS A SUPPLY ISSUE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DOUBLING OUR CAPACITY ONCE THE PERKINELMER LAB OPENS -- AND THEN I THINK AGAIN THE REALLY THE PRINCIPLE IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST TO DO THE TESTING AND SO THAT WE CAN FIND CASES ISOLATE THEM CONTACTS QUARANTINE RIGHT IT'S IT'S HOW SHE DID IT CONTAIN THE DISEASE THAT'S THE MITIGATION WITH IS CLOSING OF SECTORS AND YOU KNOW THE MASSIVE DOESN'T THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTIENEN IT HAS TO BE LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT WITH THE TESTING AND FINDING IT SURE AND AND AND AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND I'M I'M OF COURSE MYSELF AND OTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO GET TESTED AND EACH OF THE COMMITTEES IF THEY IF THEY'RE SYMPTOMATIC OR IF THEY'VE IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED SO I'D I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SINCE THE CIRCUMSTANCE I WILL I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS AND OLDER THERE'S A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IT IN KERN COUNTY AND IN THE CENTER VALLEY WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING FEDERAL MOBILE TESTING SITES IN WORKING WITH CONJUNCTION WITH CALLAWAY YES BUT THERE'S BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE THOUSANDS I I THINK THE LACK OF THE LATEST NUMBER HEARD WHEN THE PREVIOUSLY WAS EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NEGATIVE TESTS WERE NOT INCLUDED -- IN THE STATE DATABASE EVEN THOUGH THE CURRENT AND MAYBE THIS IS -- IN REFERENCE OF A VISIT TO -- TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE MEMBER COOPER'S RESPONSE THAT MET SOME OF THAT WAS PAPER REPORTING VERSE IS ELECTRONIC BUT IS IT THE POSITION OF CV PH THAT ALL TEST WHEN THEY'RE TAKEN ARE IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA THAT'S PROVIDED IN CAR READY YES AND WE KNOW THAT THAT SPECIFIC SITUATION AND AS YOU POINTED OUT AS A FEDERAL ASSET THAT WAS DEPLOYED AND THEY WHEN THEY DEPLOYED NOT REALLY ON THAT THAT'S A MISSION TO US SO WE ARE STILL WORKING ON THAT DIRECT DATA FEED BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE RECEIVING THAT DATA INDIRECTLY INCLUDING INTO THE COUNTIES OKAY BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS INCLUDED THAT THAT WAS THAT RETROSPECTIVELY BUT MOVING FORWARD WE'RE STILL WE STILL ARE UTILIZING THE MOBILE TESTING SITES AND I BELIEVE THAT AS WE'RE TRYING TO RAMP UP AND AS YOU INDICATED IDENTIFY CERTAIN HOT SPOTS IN THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT THE MOBILE TESTING SITES WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE -- IN NEED SO CLEARLY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT AS THOSE TESTING SITES CONTINUE TO TEST ESPECIALLY IN AN INVALID YOU KNOW COMMUNITY KERN COUNTY THAT THERE'S ARE THOSE ARE COUNTED YES ABSOLUTELY OKAY -- AND THEN LASTLY I GUESS IS -- MAYBE I THIS IS A BROADER QUESTION BUT YOU CAN INDICATED IN THE DARK CIRCUMVENTS THAT HAPPENED THE WILDFIRES ARE CLEARLY ONE OF THEM -- AS THE GUIDANCE IS THAT REEVALUATED OR THEY RE EVALUATE OVER TIME AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA AS WE LOOK AT TRENDS AS THINGS ARE IMPROVING WITH THOSE GUIDANCES CHANGE OR THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT STATIC I'M ASSUMING THAT THEIR DYNAMIC BUT HOW OFTEN ARE THEY REEVALUATED AND -- AND HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT THERE WE'RE FINDING OUT IN A PRESS CONFERENCE INSTEAD OF MAYBE HAVING MORE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS IN TERMS OF IT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING INPUT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AND FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS -- WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME INPUT IN TERMS OF HOW THESE ARE REALLY AFFECTING REAL BUSINESS IS REAL INDIVIDUALS WILL FAMILIES SIR THANK YOU FOR THE BECAUSE AS FAR AS HOW OFTEN THINGS ARE ABOUT TO RE EVALUATE I WOULD SAY CONSTANTLY -- AND IT'S HARD TO PREDICT YOU KNOW WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGY NEW GUIDANCE FROM YOU KNOW THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OR THE CDC OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OR DATA WE'RE LOOKING AT IT WITHIN THE STATE THAT FARMS ARE DECISIONS SO WE'RE I'D SAY DALY LOOKING AT REEVALUATING EVERYTHING ARE TESTING GUIDANCE SPECIFICALLY I'D SAY IT'S JUST CONSTANTLY EVOLVING FOR DIFFERENT SETTINGS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- SO THAT'S A CONSTANT AND I THINK WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AND YOU KNOW REALLY THINK -- YOU KNOW TAKE THAT BACK TO INTERNALLY AND WITH ART WITHIN THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW TO BETTER COMMUNICATE TO ALL OF YOU OKAY I APPRECIATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME SIR YEAH THANK YOU MISTER PRIME HI GOOD MORNING I WANT TO START WITH JUST A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR PAN ABOUT THE -- THE COLOR TIER SYSTEM OUT ONE SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE HAS BEEN THAT THE COLORS APPLY ON A COUNTY WIDE LEVEL -- WHICH IS REALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF ARBITRARY LINES ON A MAP -- IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO SORT OF THE REAL WORLD CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONTIGUOUS COMMUNITIES -- SO THE CITY OF FOLSOM WHICH I REPRESENT AS VERY LOW CASE RATE AND IT'S NEXT EL DORADO HILLS -- WHICH IS PART WHICH IS IN THE THE THIRD LEVEL WHAT IS THAT I GUESS THE ORANGE -- TEAR -- WHEREAS FULSOME BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THAT HAVE VERY SIMILAR -- PROFILES AND IT COMES TO -- THE PREVALENCE OF KOBE NINETEEN IN THE COMMUNITY -- ARE SUBJECTED TO VASTLY DIFFERENT TO BUSINESSES AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO HAVE IS YOUR DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT IS MORE FOCUSED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND HAS COME UP A FEW TIMES AND I THINK I THINK THERE ARE MANY TO LOOKING AT SOMETHING HAVING WIDE VERSUS CITIES ARE OTHERS AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE IS NOT NO SORT OF COUNTY BORDERS ARE CITY BORDERS BUT WE DO HAVE TO THINGS AND -- PROVIDE GOVERNANCE IN THE STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE SO I THINK -- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THAT'S -- THOSE ARE CONSIDERATIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT I THINK OUR APPROACH IS STILL THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO ACTUALLY TOUCH ON -- WE WILL LIKELY BE SAYING WHAT HONOR HEALTH EQUITY METRIC THAT YOU KNOW YOU REALLY WANT TO CLOSE USING A LIST OF TRANSMISSION ALISTAIR HE -- AND HAVE KIND OF ALL GOVERNMENT ALL COMMUNITY APPROACH TO REALLY GET YOU KNOW FIND WHERE YOUR HIGHEST HOT SPOTS ARE AND WHERE DISEASE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T GET THOSE DOWN AND THAT WILL HELP ALL OF YOU MOVE FORWARD NANCY THAT PRINCIPLE CAN APPLY DIFFERENT WAYS WHETHER IT'S CERTAIN COMMUNITIES CERTAIN GEOGRAPHY -- THAT WE WE HAVE HEARD INTEREST IN THAT AND I WILL ACTUALLY SPEAK AS A WHEN I WAS AT A LOCAL COUNTY LEVEL THAT REQUEST CAME TO ME AT A LOCAL KIND OF LEVEL I ALSO DID NOT THINK THAT WE COULD DO THAT JUST BECAUSE WE NEED TO YOU KNOW GOVERN AND THE STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STRUCTURES WE HAVE ZERO YOU MEAN THAT THAT COUNTY GOVERNMENT IS THE STRUCTURALLY HAPPENED SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF WHERE YOU'RE PLACING THAT OF DIFFERENT CALLERS TO THE COUNTY LEVEL BECAUSE THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE THE SYSTEM THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE JUST WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SYSTEM IS LARGELY COUNTY BASED THERE ARE CITY HALL THREE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AND ACTUALLY THOSE THREE CITIES ALL AROUND THAT IT AND TO COUNTIES AND THOSE CITIES ARE ALSO HAVING TO FOLLOW ALONG AND AND AND BE PART OF THE COUNTY METRICS BECAUSE AGAIN I KNOW YOU GREAT SOME POINTS ABOUT PERIPHERAL VERSES WITH THEN THAT THEY'RE ALL WITHIN ONE ENTITY AND THEY THE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAVE COMPLETE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY BUT THEY ACTUALLY CANNOT CANNOT HAVE A DIFFERENT RULE TO MOVE YOU KNOW WITHIN THE TEARS OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY OKAY JUST DO THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO TO REALLY GET TO THAT THE CONCERN AT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW WERE -- CREATING RESTRICTIONS ON THE BASIS OF PREVALENCE OF COVER NINETEEN IN A GIVEN REGION -- BUT -- IT'S BEING DONE IN SUCH A BROAD BRUSH THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE -- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE YOU KNOW CLOSER PHYSICALLY TO YEAR THAN THEY ARE TO THE MORE PROBLEMATIC AREAS OF THEIR OWN COUNTY -- AND YET -- ARE BEING FORCED INTO A TEAR THAT CLEARLY IS NOT THE CORRECT ONES FOR THEM SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL A CITY LIKE FOLSOM YOU KNOW WHAT DO THEY NEED TO SHOW YOU IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT OF A TEAR THAT IS NOT -- YOU KNOW SIMPLY AT THE MERCY OF THE REST OF THE COUNTY I MEAN AGAIN I THINK THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES THAT DISEASE TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW IT THIS VIRUSES SPECIFICALLY MOVES VERY QUICKLY WE'VE SEEN HOW QUICKLY THINGS ESCALATED THIS SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY IN CERTAIN REGIONS SO JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY PARTS NOT MEAN PEOPLE CANNOT GO BACK AND FORTH AND WE'RE CERTAINLY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MIXING ACROSS COMMUNITIES AS ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES AS I MENTIONED FOR THE SECTORS BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW SIGNED I JUST GOT THAT THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE QUESTION MANY PEOPLE CAN CROSS COUNTY LINES AS WELL SO THAT'S AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HAVING DIFFERENT TIERS FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES I MEAN THE QUESTION IS SPECIFICALLY -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE CASES LIKE THE CITY OF FOLSOM WHY CAN'T THE STATE ESTABLISH A SET OF CRITERIA TO ALLOW -- IN CASES LIKE THAT A GREATER DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE COUNTY BY COUNTY SYSTEM OFFERS I THINK IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT I READ I MEAN WHEN WE HAVE COUNTY BASED SORT OF -- ORDINANCES OR RULES OR STATEWIDE THINGS ARE COUNTY BASED THAT WE CAN'T NECESSARILY CHANGE THOSE FOR SPECIFIC -- SUBGROUPS WELL SURE YOU CAN THE STATE'S CREATING THE WHOLE SYSTEM I MEAN THIS IS AN ENTIRELY NEW THING THAT THE STATE'S PUT IN PLACE THAT CAN DO IT HOWEVER WANTS RIGHT WHITE WHY CAN'T THAT BE DONE BUT IT'S BASED ON THE CRACKS OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AND OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE COUNTY THIS AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORKING ON COULD DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTION AND CONTROL ARE IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE COUNTY -- AND OTHER CITIES TO SEE THAT AT A COUNTY LEVEL C. CERTIFIED SAY SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO WORK TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE A SET OF CRITERIA FOR FULSOME AND SAID THAT THAT WAS YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT THEY CAN MANAGE WITH YOUR APARTMENT BE OKAY SIGNING OFF ON THAT WE WOULD STILL BE ASSIGNING THE SAME TEARS BASED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL ALL RIGHT WELL I WOULD -- SIMPLY ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A MORE WE ARE REAL WORLD APPROACH I THINK THAT SIMPLY SINGLE IT'S EASIER TO DO IT BY COUNTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE HAPPEN TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT UNITS OF GOVERNMENT READY MADE IN EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING FORCED TO CLOSE PERMANENTLY YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NEVER RECOVER IN SOME WAYS AND JUST SAY WELL IT'S IT'S JUST EASIER TO DO IT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT TO ME IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER MOVING ON TO THE THE DATA GLITCH -- SO I -- RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ACTING DIRECTOR SHE READ -- IN -- AUGUST AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH BEEN THE DEPARTMENT IS BUILT REDUNDANT PROCESSES TO VALIDATE THE DATA REPORTS FOLLOWING THE GLITCH AND INDEED WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY I'VE HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED ABOUT PARALLEL VALIDATION SYSTEMS AN INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION CHANNELS SO JUST TO CLARIFY THESE ARE ALL REDUNDANCIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOLLOWING THE DATA QUITS RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YES WE WE WERE DOING SOME CHECKING BUT I'M NOT AT THE EXTENT THAT WAS REQUIRED WITH THE VOLUME INCREASE AT THAT -- THE LEVELS THAT IT'S GONE UP ARE THEY JUST MADE THERE WAS MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN SO THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED STARTING THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AS WE UNCOVER ALL THE ISSUES AND DEVELOPS OF COUNTER BALANCES AND EVERY SINGLE DAY THE METRICS SEASON IS THE VOLUME INCREASE THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I FIND A LITTLE MYSTIFYING ABOUT THIS THIS WHOLE INCIDENT IS THAT YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD TIME AND AGAIN THE CAL READY SYSTEM WAS NOT A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE SORT OF ALL YOUR BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE SORT OF ALL I AM -- AND YET IT TOOK AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO PUT IN PLACE THE SORT OF REDUNDANCIES -- WHICH ARE YOU KNOW SORT OF A STANDARD FEATURE OF OF ENGINEERING WHEN YOU HAVE A CRITICAL SYSTEM SUNLIGHT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO WHITE WHY WAS THAT NOT DONE SOONER ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW HEAVILY THE STATE HAS RELIED ON THIS DATA WELL -- SO THE RIVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IS IT WAS SIGNIFICANT AND EVERYTHING WAS IMPORTANT BUT WHEN COVERT CAME THE DATA METRICS -- WERE LARGE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA BUT THEY ALSO WERE NEEDED EVERY SINGLE DAY IT AT SO THE URGENCY OF UP YEAR LARGE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND BEING COUNTED THAT DAY WERE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THEY WERE YEAR TWO YEARS AGO SO WE WATCH THE SYSTEMS -- WE WERE DOING FIVE THOUSAND MESSAGES A DAY IN OUR GATEWAY NOW WE'RE DOING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SO UP THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED BUT THEY ARE WORKING UNDER THE NEW LOW BECAUSE WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS BUT -- AT THE TIME THEY WERE OPERATING AT A PACE BASED ON THE MESSAGES THAT WERE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE FELT THAT WE HAD A REALLY GOOD HANDLE ON ON ALL THE LABS ARE REPORTING AND HOW OFTEN YOU'RE REPORTING THAT THE NUMBERS GOING UP MORE LAPSED MORE CRITICALITY AND IF A BATCH OF -- E. A LARGE DIDN'T GET PROCESS FOR SOME REASON -- THE COUNTY'S NEW THAT DAY AND WERE TALKING TO US AND SO WE HAD TO THEN IMPLEMENT A GREATER -- SINGLE DAY OF ALL THE MESSAGES ARE COMING AND TO KEEP UP TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNT WAS ACCURATE FOR THAT DAY SO WHEN THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED I MEAN WAS IT A SURPRISE WHY DID WHY DID IT HAPPEN WHILE ARE WE READY FOR THIS I GUESS IS MY QUESTION SO ARM I THINK WE KNEW THAT THE LABORATORY TEST WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE -- DID WE PLAN FOR THEM TO GO UP TEN TIMES SO PROBABLY NOT I THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO CAUSE THIS IS THAT IT WAS A COMBINATION OF A NUMBER OF THINGS OR TWO OR THREE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY HOSTAGE SITUATION DE DUPLICATE MESSAGES THE BACKLOG BECAUSE OF THEM THE CHANGES WE MADE TO OUR GATEWAY TO TRY TO CATER FOR THAT -- A SITUATION WHEN ON A NORMAL WEEKEND WHERE THERE WAS A PATCHING GOING ON -- THE SYSTEM DIDN'T COME BACK UP TO THE CONFIGURATION THERE A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPEN OVER THOSE TO A THREE WEEK PERIOD IT CAUSED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BACK LOCKED AND AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE REACHED AND WE RESPONDED TO THAT ALSO KNOWING THAT THE NUMBER OF THE LAB TESTS ARE GOING TO GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY WE KNOW STARTING NEXT MONTH SOME ADDITIONAL COULD BE AS MUCH AS FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND BY THE END OF THE YEAR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MORE SO WE HAVE JUST CONTINUE TO PUT RESOURCES IN TIME TO ENSURE THE QUALITY SCALABILITY RELIABILITY IS BETTER TODAY THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK SOME OF THE STEPS ARE ENCOURAGING BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THE TEN FOLD INCREASE WHY NOT WHY WAS THAT SURPRISING REALLY ANSWER IT I MEAN I THINK YEAH IN HINDSIGHT IT'S IT WE CAN GO BACK AS A YEAH WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT THE SISTERS WERE PERFORMING PRETTY WELL AND WE FELT WE HAD TO PASS CITY -- BUT YEAH WE DID QUICKLY REALIZED THAT I MEAN THE SAME SYSTEMS TODAY ARE IN PLACE THAT WERE THERE TWO MONTHS THREE MONTHS AGO WE'VE JUST PUT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IN IMPROVING -- THE PERFORMANCES OF SYSTEMS BY -- DOING DEEP ANALYSIS AND BRINGING AND SKILLS PARTIES I AND MANY MORE STAFF TO WORK ON THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST -- YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU HAD THE GOVERNOR IN MARCH SAYING THAT UP TO TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE COULD ULTIMATELY GET COBA NINETEEN AND TELLING US ON A DAILY BASIS THAT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS OF YOUR DAILY LIVES ON THE BASIS OF THE DATA -- AND WHEN EVERYONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE EXISTING SYSTEM WAS NOT BUILT TO HANDLE THIS SORT OF VOLUME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN URGENT PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE THAT NO STONE IS LEFT UNTURNED TO CREATE REDUNDANCIES WE WOULD NEED TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE FLOW OF DATA THAT WAS TO SERVE AS THE BASIS OF THOSE DECISIONS AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO WELL I APPRECIATE THE CORRECTIVE STEPS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN YOU KNOW THAT'S TO FIX THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A REACTIVE POSTURE SO I WOULD SIMPLY ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO TAKE A MORE FOR LIKE THE THINKING APPROACH TO TRY TO ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT COME UP AND SURE THAT WE HAVE AT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT WE NEED AND THE LAST POINT I JUST WANT TO RAISE IS ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION OF THIS -- INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC ACT AS THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH SAID COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT EMAIL ON JULY THIRTY FIRST DESCRIBING AN ISSUE -- PROCESSING LAB RESULTS IN DELAYS IN THE COW READY SYSTEM AND THE EMAIL I. NOTES THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE PROBLEM EVEN EARLIER -- AND YET THREE DAYS LATER -- THE GOVERNOR HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND TOUTED A DECLINE IN COVERT CASES -- ON THE BASIS OF THAT INACCURATE DATA SO WHY IS IT THAT SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT KNEW ABOUT AT LEAST THREE DAYS EARLIER DIDN'T FIND ITS WAY TO THE GOVERNOR AS HE -- CONVEYED THIS PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION SORRY THAT IS ONE OF THE QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES WE HAVE PUT BACK IN PLACE THAT THAT INFORMATION DID NOT FLOW UP IT DID NOT PULL UP TO THE DIRECTOR IT DID NOT FLY UP TO AGENCY OR TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM -- AND WE PUT IN A LOT OF CONTROL MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN OKAY AND CAN YOU BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT EXACTLY WHY IT WHAT WERE THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THAT SORT OF A INFORMATION FLOW AND WHAT THE QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES ARE SO ONE QUALITY CONTROL MEASURE IS THAT THE MESSAGING GOING OUT TO OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IS NOW REVIEWED UP THE CHAIN SAW THAT MESSAGING THAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN STOCK OUR ANY AND OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WORKING ON THE GROUND IS ALSO INCLUDED WITH THE DIRECTOR AND AND LEADERSHIP SO THAT WE WOULD BE AWARE AS SOON AS THOSE MESSAGES GO OUT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE A PROBLEM WE HAVE MULTIPLE NOTIFICATIONS NOW PUT IN PLACE SO THAT ANY ISSUES THAT COME UP ARE ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO ONE PERSON OR LINE MANAGER BUT GOING TO MULTIPLE AND GOING UP THE CHAIN HAS SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW MORE QUICKLY THAT SOMETHING IS -- CHALLENGING OR A BARRIER TO GETTING ACCURATE TIMELY DATA ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I THINK I YOU KNOW I JUST CANNOT HAVE SIZE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE THAT THE PUBLIC IS A SURE HEARD -- THAT THE INFORMATION IS BEING COMMUNICATED TO IT IS ACCURATE AND THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE AND YOU KNOW TO MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE WE HAD THE THE RESIGNATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR -- THAT CAME AMIDST THIS WHOLE INCIDENT AND THE GOVERNOR WOULDN'T EVEN TELL US WHY HE WOULD SAY THAT WAS A PRIVATE PERSONNEL MATTER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RESIGNATION OF THE CALIFORNIA -- DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY A CONNECTED TO THE SITUATION SO -- I -- I I I WOULD JUST REITERATE WHAT I SAID BEFORE THAT ON A FORWARD GOING BASIS I HOPE THAT THINGS ARE LOOKED AT IN A -- IN A FORWARD LOOKING AND SYSTEMATIC WAY SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST CONSTANTLY IN THIS REACTIVE POSTURE THAT I THINK IS -- YOU KNOW -- HAMSTRUNG OUR STATE'S CODE RESPONSE IN MANY WAYS YEAH WE WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND -- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR LEVEL OF QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S BEEN QUITE INFORMATIVE AND REALLY APPRECIATE IT SPECIFICALLY I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE ADJUSTED RATES -- WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT AND SO I WILL HAVE MY FIRST QUESTION TOWARDS DOCTOR PAN IF I CAN HAVE HER COME TO THE CHAIR BUT I BELIEVE SPOKE ABOUT SCHOOLS REOPENING WITH THE RED TIER AND AS MANY OF US SEE THIS AS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE POSITIVE STEPS FORWARD I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SPEAK ABOUT -- THAT JUST SO THAT WE CAN HAVE CLARIFICATION SURE SO JUST WHAT THE RULES ARE ABOUT IN SCHOOL STUDENTS ABSOLUTELY SO TO REITERATE AGAIN -- BASICALLY -- WAS ONCE A COUNTY HAS ENTERED INTO THE RED HERE AND THERE IN THAT READ HERE FOR TWO WEEKS IF THE ACCOUNT REMAINS STABLE IN THAT TWO WEEKS AND YOU KNOW DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S GONNA RESTRICTION THAN THE SCHOOLS COULD BEGIN TO RE OPEN AND AS YOU'RE SEEING I THINK MANY OF THOSE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES ARE STILL IF WITHIN THAT DECIDING TO PHASE THAT RE OPENING OF THE OTHER ISSUE I DIDN'T MENTION EARLIER IS THAT -- IN THE PURPLE TEAR THE WIDE FOR TRANSITION TO HEAR AGAIN PRIORITIZING OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WHO WOULD KNOW HARDEST TIME WITH DISTANCE LEARNING -- THAT COUNTY IS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS GIVING AND -- SCHOOL LEADERS CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR A WAIVER FOR KINDERGARTEN TEACHER THREE SIX GRADE THEY CAN SUBMIT A WAIVER TO THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE OFFICER CAN WE GET THOSE WAIVERS OFTEN SUSSING THE SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY NEED TO POST THAT SAFETY PLAN PUBLICLY SO THAT THEIR COMMUNITY CAN SEE THE SCHOOLS ALSO NEED TO BE THERE THEIR TEACHER IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND SORT OF MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SUPPORT TO RE OPEN AND THEY APPLY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S ASSESSMENT AND THEY ALSO CONSULT WITH US AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO -- AS THE ACTING STATE HEALTH OFFICER IT'S AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AYE YOU KNOW HOW WE KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE AS WELL AND CONSULTED WE ANSWERED EXPRESSED CONCERNS IF WE HAVE ANY ABOUT THE SITUATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS SO AGAIN IT'S TWO WEEKS IN THE RED HERE AFTER THE TWO WEEKS SCHOOLS THREE OPEN AND THEN SCHOOLS CAN APPLY FOR A WAIVER IN THERE COUNTY -- K. TWO SIX -- AND THAT AND THEN WITHIN THAT IS THERE HAVE BEEN SITUATIONS ARE ACTUALLY JUST HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE'S A REALLY HIGH DISEASE TRANSMISSION LEVEL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THAT -- IF THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS OVER FOURTEEN PER CAPITA FOURTEEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES PER DAY IT'S ABOUT THAT WE REALLY DON'T RECOMMEND SCHOOLS RE OPENING AT THAT POINT BUT ONCE YOU GET BELOW THAT THAT THERE COULD BE AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR A WAIVER AND I'M NOT ALLOWS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER TO ASSESS THE SAFETY PLANS OF THE SCHOOLS THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW I I DO WANT TO SAY -- THE THINGS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING IT WAS BACK ON MARCH SECOND THAT I HAD A DOCTOR ANGEL HERE PRESENT AND WORSE ABLE TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS AND WANTS TO HIGHLIGHTS AND HER NAME WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER I BELIEVE HER TO BE A CHAMPION FOR SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE THAT TO REALLY STOOD UP AND SPOKE FOR MUCH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HAS HELPED US TO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY AND SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HER TIME HERE AND HER SERVICE TO OUR STATE AS SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING TOWARDS THAT BUT IT'S IN THAT VEIN THAT I FEEL LIKE I MUST ASK IF WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENINGS SOME OF THE DISCREPANCIES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SO I'M HOPING YOU CAN SPEAK TO IF YOU CAN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET LOST IN THE MY NEW SHOW OF THE MOMENT AND NOT SEE WHICH PARTS OF OUR STATE ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THIS VIRUS THE MOST AND SO I'M HOPING IF YOU CAN TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY CHILDREN WHAT ARE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE STATE AND ARE THERE HEALTH DISPARITIES SO AND I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THAT AND -- THIS IS AN AREA I ALSO HAVE A A LOT OF INTEREST AND I WOULD SAY WHAT IS ENCOURAGING ABOUT CHILDREN AND PEDIATRIC CASES IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COVER NINETEEN AN IMPRACTICAL THE NINETEEN IS THAT WE ARE SEEING MORE CHILDREN TEST POSITIVE BECAUSE MORE CHILDREN ARE -- HAVING YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL HAVING SYMPTOMS -- BUT IS STILL A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF CASES THAN THE PROPORTION OF KIDS IN THE POPULATION AND AMOUNTS ARE HOSPITALIZATIONS I BELIEVE IT IS STILL I WILL NEED TO CONFIRM THIS BUT I BELIEVE IT IS STILL LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF OUR CASES ARE HOSPITAL'S CHILDREN'S SO OVERALL I THINK AND -- DOCTRINA YOU MAY OR MAY NOT OF HEARD AS WELL THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING AREAS AROUND LIKE CHILDREN -- WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT AND SLEW AS FAR AS RESTORATION IRISES THE CHILDREN DO NOT SEEM TO BE ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN SEEM TO BE DISEASE NOT BE AFFECTED AS OFTEN AND OFTEN -- ARE NOT TRANSMITTING TO OTHERS SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING TO TO KEEP IN CONSIDERATION AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS AND THEN IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WITH FLU AND FLU MODELING AND THE WHOLE REASONS BEHIND SCHOOL CLOSURES WITH FLU OR THEIR KIDS COULD BE DRIVERS OF TRANSMISSION AND OFTEN SPREADING TO OTHERS THAT YOUNG CHILDREN BUT AGAIN THIS INFORMATION CHANGES EVERY DAY THERE'S SOME THOUGHT THAT KIDS HAVE -- A SMALLER LEVEL THESE RECEPTORS THAT VIRUS ENTERS YOUR BODY AND THAT'S WHY THAT KIDS ARE NOT GETTING SICK -- I'D SAY THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PARAMETERS THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO -- TO LOOK AT AND THINK ABOUT AND I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE LEADING TO THIS IS WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS FOR KIDS NOT BEING IN SCHOOL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND TAX -- YOU KNOW WHAT A LEARNING IMPACTS OF THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AS WELL AND AGAIN CONTINUING LIKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BALANCE AND I DO WANNA ECHO THAT WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT THIS IS VERY HARD AND EVERYONE IS HEARTED BUSINESSES IS JUST AGAIN S. AS UNITS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME A ONCE IN A CENTURY CITY YOU ASIAN -- SO I THINK THERE ARE DEFINITELY -- HEALTH OUTCOMES FROM CHILDREN NOT BEING IN SCHOOL BOTH DEVELOPMENTALLY AND WITH THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH AS WELL AS THE RISK OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN THE SETTINGS AND WE'RE CONTINUALLY TRYING TO BALANCE THAT AT ALL LEVELS HI I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD -- THAT IF WE LOOK AT OVERALL DATA WE SEE THAT LATINO AND BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COVERED NINETY EIGHT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT KIDS WHO ARE IN SCHOOL THE MAJORITY OF THOSE KIDS ARE LATINO AND SO BY CORRELATION WE COULD SAY THE EFFECTS WILL BE BORNE BY THE BY MOST THE LATINO POPULATION AND SO I HAVE CONCERNS WHEN WE ARE STILL LEARNING THINGS ABOUT THIS DISEASE ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECT THE LONG HAULERS IF YOU WILL THOSE WHO CONTRACT THE DISEASE BUT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MANIFESTATIONS DOWNSTREAM THUS FAR AND I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT BUT IT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE HEARD YOU TALK OR OR -- -- SOMEONE WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SPEAK ABOUT THE HEALTHEQUITY METRIC AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT SO THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE HELPFUL SURE -- YEAH THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT -- IT IS BIG BECAUSE AS YOU SAID I THINK DOCTOR ANGEL HERSELF IS A VERY LARGE HAVING OF THIS AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CORE VALUES OUR ENTIRE HOPE TO BE THINKING ABOUT HEALTH EQUITY AND AS YOU ALSO MENTIONED -- VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISPERSION IMPACT ON OUR LATINO POPULATION AND THEN A HIGHER PROPORTION OF DUST MORE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION SO THE HELD EQUITY METRIC TALKING TO SORT OF LOCAL HEALTH SLOWS LOCAL COUNTY OFFICIALS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FROM -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PREVIOUS ORGANIZATION REALLY FOCUSING PUBLICLY AND WHAT WE ARE AROUND LOOKING AT DIFFERENCES AND -- SOMETHING CALLED THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND THIS IS AN INDEX WE USE IN PUBLIC HEALTH TO LOOK ABOUT ALL THE FACTORS REYES SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT -- THE THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND IT'S LOOKED AT BY CENSUS TRACT SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE LOW THE MOST ADVANCED CLOSE QUARTILE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE COUNTIES AND THOSE THE PEOPLE IN THOSE QUARTILES OF THAT ARE HAVING A TEST POSITIVITY IN THE SAME RANGE AS AS THE WHOLE COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD -- SO THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE EFFECTIVE LIKELY STARTING NEXT WEEK AND AGAIN WILL BE KIND OF ANNOUNCING MORE THE DETAILS BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT -- AGAIN THIS LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT THE THE MOST JUST PARTIALLY IMPACTED THAT YOU CANNOT MOVE TO THE RED HERE FROM PURPLE AND THAT GROUP IS ACTUALLY ALSO RIGHT HERE SO THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY IMPACTS AND THEN THERE WILL ALSO BE SOMETHING WHERE IF YOU'RE LOWEST QUARTILE THE HELP IF THIS IS THE NEXT HAS A TEST POSITIVE IT'S TWO TIERS BELOW AND YOUR CASE RATE IS DECLINING YOU MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK FOR IT SO WE ARE TYING FLOORED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TO HEALTH EQUITY METRIC IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE AND THEN WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAMS FOR COUNTIES THAT -- ARE SEEING A LOT OF THESE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF OUR WORKING WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A TEAM AND WITH -- SOME OF OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OTHER PARTNERS -- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY SO THEY CAN BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO HELP FIVE WHAT ARE SOME POLICIES THAT AT COUNTY LEVEL CAN BE SUPPORTED TO HELP WITH YOU KNOW ALL THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT ARE WRAPPED INTO A LOT OF THESE DEPRESSION TAX WHETHER IT'S KIND OF HOUSING REPLACEMENT SICK LEAVE ALL OF THOSE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ARE REALLY AGAIN LEADING TO THE INABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ISOLATE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT COMPLETENESS OF EVERY STEP THE CITY DATA SO CURRENTLY WE ESTIMATE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE DATA IS MISSING STATEWIDE IS DEFINITELY IMPROVED WE ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY UPDATED AND -- HIGHLIGHTED PUSHED OUT OUR REGULATIONS THAT RAISE THAT THE CITY DIDN'T NEED TO BE REPORTED WITH OUR CASE DATA LABORATORIES AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AS WELL SO WE'RE GOING TO BE -- UPDATING OUR DASHBOARD TO BE BUT IT COUNTY LEVEL RACES ALL AND WORKING AT COUNTIES IMPROVE THEIR DATA COLLECTION FOR THAT AS WELL THANK YOU DOCTOR PLAN FOR THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A LEVEL OF DETAIL AND BEING ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OFFLINE -- BUT DO WANT TO APPRECIATE YOU HIGHLIGHTING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AS I BELIEVE WAGE REPLACEMENT FAMILY LEAVE ARE IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE'RE USING ALL TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THIS VICIOUS VIRUS BUT WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OFTENTIMES THE DISCREPANCIES WE SEE ANY AND HEALTH CARE ARE A REFLECTION OF THE DISPARITIES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROVIDERS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LEVELS OF TRUST AND JUST WENT CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR STATES TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE AND WILL AND MY COMMENTS IF I CAN BUY -- SAYING THAT AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR I OFTENTIMES REALIZE THAT WE HAD A CHAIN OF COMMAND WE HAD A EACH HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AND -- THAT EACH OF US HAD TO DO WHAT WE DID WITH OUR RULES THAT AT SOME POINT I WANTS TO NOW MAKE SURE WE ARE APPRECIATING OUR GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW WHO IS ACTING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THAT THESE ARE TOUGH AND CONSTANTLY EVOLVING MOMENTS BUT I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH WHAT I'VE SEEN OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM STEPPING UP AND HELPING TO PROVIDE BEST PRACTICES FOR MY COUNTY THROUGH A STRIKE TEAM THAT WE WOULD NOT SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE ARE WITHIN OUR DATA AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THAT APPRECIATION -- AND IT IS A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR MANY OF US THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TRYING GET TO TOWARDS READ SO WE CAN GET OUR SCHOOLS BACK OPEN SO WE CAN GET BACK TO SOME LEVELS OF NORMALCY BUT I WOULD NOT WANT TO LET THE MOMENT PASS AND NOT SAY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR LEADER OF THE STATE AND THAT'S ONCE THE POLICIES HE'S PASSING THIS BLUEPRINT THESE TEARS ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTIES TO FOLLOW IS TO LISTEN AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMIND THOSE WHO ARE LOCAL DECISION MAKERS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THEIR DECISIONS ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOW I WILL TELL YOU AS A STATE LEGISLATOR I'VE BEEN SPENDING MY TIME OVER THE LAST MONTH READING THE FEDERALIST PAPERS BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SEPARATION OF OUR POWERS AND WHEN COUNTIES BECAME THAT INTERMEDIARY IF YOU WILL TO PROVIDING PUBLIC I THINK THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR US TO ASK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DEALING WITH CRISIS LIKE TODAY THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THIS IS THE PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE NEED TO LEAN INTO OUR GOVERNOR AND ALLOW HIM THE POWERS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO COMBAT THIS VIRUS JUST TO AND WITH DATA THUS FAR WE PASSED A MILLION DEATHS IN THE WORLD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS OF COME FROM AMERICA TWENTY PERCENT OF THOSE DEATHS WE ARE FOUR PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THUS FAR OUR STATE HAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INMATE DEATHS WE ARE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF OUR OVERALL COUNTRY WE ARE DOING A GOOD JOB HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND LISTEN TO THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS BUT I WOULD JUST ASK THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THEY DO THINK YOU'RE HEARING IT FROM A NUMBER OF US BETTER COMMUNICATION AND ABILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY WERE FINANCES ARE INVOLVED I THINK WE ARE VERY CONNECTED TO OUR COMMUNITIES WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THEM AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND I WAS QUITE PROUD TO BE WITH HER CHIEF SERVICE OFFICE YESTERDAY AS WE WERE VOLUNTEERING AT A FOOD BANK WHICH IS WHY I STARTED MY COMMENTS THE WAY I DID BUT NOW THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS DOING QUITE A BIT TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I SHARED THAT APPRECIATION THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU DR REPLICA ONE QUICK QUESTION MR FONG BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY QUESTIONS AND I WAS UP BY ONE QUESTION AND ACTUALLY MY -- MY COLLEAGUE OF AS A KIND OF LIKE SET IT UP FOR ME -- IN TERMS OF NEW METRICS COMING OUT -- YOU'RE DOT ORG YOU YOU I GUESS KIND OF ANNOUNCED HERE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER METRIC -- COMING -- AND I'LL HAVE THE COUNTIES AND AND AS YOU INDICATED BEFORE THE NEED FOR SIMPLIFICATION TO MOVE THROUGH THE TEARS -- ARE THERE ARE NONE I GUESS HOW MANY NEW METRICS ARE COMING OUT AND WILL THIS DELAY COUNTIES ARE MOVING UP AND DOWN OR IS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING I THINK THERE'S A I MEAN UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR TO ADD TO ADDRESS -- YOU KNOW THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AT MY COLLEAGUE AND I SHARE THE SENSE OF ALLEY BUT HOW DOES THAT GET DETERMINED -- IN TERMS OF ADDING NEW METRICS THAT NOW COUNTIES HAVE TO PLAN FOR A JUST FOR YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THEIR COMMUNITIES A REAL BAND IN THEIR SCHOOLS REOPEN IN CHURCHES AND BUSINESSES AND THEN NOW YOU'RE WE'RE KIND OF THROWING MORE ON TOP OF THEM COMING OUT ON TOP OF THIS ONE NEW ONE AND -- I GUESS WALK ME THROUGH THAT PROCESS THANK THEIR CURRICULA FOR FREE OF KNOWLEDGE MINT -- SO WE ANNOUNCED ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST THAT THAT TEST POSITIVITY AND CASE RATES WERE THE KEY METRICS AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE OUT SO WE KNOW THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING -- WE ARE NOT INTENDING TO ADD ANYTHING BEYOND THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT THAT METRIC IS SINCE SINCE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING FROM BEFORE THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSE AGAIN WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH OUR LOCAL COUNTY OFFICIALS LIKE -- YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT GOING TO MEASURE BUT WE ANNOUNCE THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT'S BEEN IN WRITING IT WAS IN OUR INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT SO IT IS NOT -- SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE TIME AND WE DON'T INTEND TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL SO THE THE THE HEALTH EQUITY METRIC WAS ALWAYS PLANTS ALWAYS PLANNED TO BE BUT THEN IT WASN'T ANNOUNCED AT THAT TIME IT WAS IS AND IT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED LATER -- IT'S GONNA BE I WAS WEAK RIGHT WE HAD WE ANNOUNCED ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST THAT WHAT THE TEARS WERE AND WHAT THE CASE RATES AND THE TEST WAS TO THE THRESHOLD WHERE AND THAT WE WERE WORKING ON A HEALTH EQUITY METRIC THAT THE ACTUAL MEASUREMENT OF WHAT IT WOULD MEASURE WITH STILL BEING WORKED ON AND WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS BUT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL METRICS ON TOP THAT THERE ARE NONE IN DISSIPATED RIGHT NOW I MEAN AGAIN WE ARE ALWAYS GONNA EVOLVING ON THE THRESHOLD IN THE METRICS AS WE LEARN MORE BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WE'RE JUST OKAY THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT DR PANDA'S GOING BACK TO -- HAVE A SENSE ON -- WHEN OR IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A COLD IS AXING SURE WE'RE VERY ACTIVELY WORKING ON OUR -- PLANNING FOR THAT -- I THINK WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST SIX THAT ARE FURTHER ALONG IN TRIALS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE US I THINK -- YOU KNOW WHEN THOSE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AND THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE CLINICAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY I THINK ARE STILL UNKNOWN -- SO I THINK YEAH BUT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING THAT WE HAVE -- ACTUALLY WERE JUST TALKING THIS MORNING WE HAVE SEVERAL -- OF COURSE AND A GREAT STATE LIKE OURS WE HAVE SEVERAL LOCAL SORT OF EXPERTS THAT ARE ON NATIONAL COMMITTEES ARE EVALUATING THESE DIFFERENT VACCINES VACCINE TRIALS AND WILL BE WORKING WITH WOOD -- HAVING THOSE EXPERTS THAT ARE WITHIN OUR STATE ADVISING US OF THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEVEL AS WELL AS WE ANTICIPATE AND NOT ROLL UP AFFECTS THE DISTRIBUTION GREAT THANK YOU -- INTO JUST GOING BACK TO I THINK WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN PARTICULAR THE COUNTIES COMMUNICATION TO HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS OR IS IT MORE JUST TO COUNTIES -- REACH OUT TO YOU OR YOU FOR BROADCAST EMAIL MEANS HOW HOW'S THAT COMMUNICATION WORKING BECAUSE IT COULD IT IT APPEARS THAT EVEN WITH THE THE THE DATA FLAW -- THAT WAS IN THE SYSTEM -- SEEM TO NEED MORE OF A COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN THAN EVEN AT THE DATA BREAKDOWNS BECAUSE IF THERE HAD BEEN A REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS PERHAPS THAT WHAT A SLACKED LEVEL ABOUT OUR COMMUNICATION THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS BASICALLY ALL THAT THAT THAT YOU ASKED SO WE HAVE SENT DEFAULT WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF WE INVITE ALL OF THE SIXTY ONE JURISDICTIONS TO WE TYPICALLY HAVE ADHOC ADDITIONAL CALLS WITH THEM PROBABLY AN EXTRA TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK -- I'D SAY AND I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT AGAIN AND -- HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT WE ALSO HAVE -- TO ACTUALLY THREE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE ALSO FORMALLY HAVE MEETINGS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT ARE ON THAT PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE SO THERE'S THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA CAPITAL LOCAL OFFICERS AND HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SO ALL THREE OF THOSE ALSO HAVE STRUCTURES -- AND -- EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES THAT WE ALSO REACH OUT THERE'S CERTAIN INPUT -- WE HAVE LOTS OF THE LAST EMAILS AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF KEEPS HAPPENING WITH -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE CD CONTROLLERS MEETINGS ONCE A WEEK WITH SOME OF THAT FROM MY END -- CRITICAL DISEASE CONTROLLERS AND OUR FRONTLINE STAFF WE HAVE -- CAL READY HELP MEETINGS PERIODICALLY A LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF ARAB CAL CONNECTOR CONTACT TRACING GROUP HAS -- LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT -- I FORGET THEY'RE CALLING IN EITHER TOWN HALLS ARE COMMUNITIES LEARNING GROUPS AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNICATION AND THERE ARE AGAIN SIXTY ONE HEALTH RESTRICTIONS -- SO -- YOU KNOW I I FEEL IN EVERY EMERGENCY YOU CAN NEVER COMMUNICATE TOO MUCH OR TOO OFTEN SO WE THAT WE DO A LOT OF OUR GREAT CONFUSION AND ALSO I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS AND HEALTH OFFICERS CERTAINLY CALL SEASON FINALE OF MYSELF FREQUENTLY THEY EMAIL US DIRECTLY THE EMAIL OUR STAFF TO CALL A SO WE HAVE I'D SAY A LOT OF COMMUNICATION GOING BACK AND FORTH AND I KNOW OUR -- OUR HEALTH CARE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY HAS A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY AND SEES ACT COUNTY AND STATE -- ASSOCIATION DIALOGUE -- I THINK -- I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALREADY MENTIONED THERE WERE SOME INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS AS WELL THAT WE HAVE A REMEDY AND SO I THINK THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT A LOT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN JULY THANK YOU SINCE YOU FEEL LIKE BETWEEN THE SIXTY ONE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE THAT HOPEFULLY AT THE VERY LEAST JURISDICTION WOULD RAISE ISSUES THAT THEY BELIEVED TO HAVE COME UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE WATCH THE DATA AS AS OFTEN AS YOU'RE WATCHING THE DATA YEAH AND I CAN SAY THAT EVERY WEEK -- BOTH INFORMALLY AND MORE FORMALLY AS WE FINALIZE OUR EDUCATION CLASSES WE DO HERE AND WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL TESTING SITE THAT ISN'T OF ANY USE THAT WE HAVE ARE OPTING OUT IS WORKING WITH THAT -- LABS A MISSION AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DIRECTLY TO GET THAT DATA SEPARATELY SO WE CAN INCLUDED INTO OUR METRICS OUT TO US ALL THE TIME WHEN THERE ARE SITUATIONS AND THEN OUR TEAMS KIND OF WORK WITH EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND AND THERE'S A WHOLE LAYER OF ISSUES THAT COULD BE HAPPENING IT COULD BE THAT THE LAB IS NOT SUBMITTING IT COULD BE THE WAY THEY'RE CALCULATING THE DATA WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY -- SET UP A HUB SO THAT THAT EMAIL JUST OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN ACCESS WE CALL THE CODE TO THE DANCE IS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ARE AT THE DEAL JUST TO TAKE CARE AND THAT'S I THINK REALLY HELPED A LOT AS WELL WITH ANY DISCREPANCIES AND I THINK NO MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A TIME LAG BECAUSE AGAIN HAVING WORKED ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL WE RECEIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE THE DATA FIRST -- IN SOME SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY FROM CLINICIANS AND THEN FROM LABS SOME OF THE LAST COMPLETELY TO OUR SYSTEM AND THEN GO TO THE LOCALS AND SOME OF THE INTERESTING OF PERSON I GET ATTACHED SO THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT WAYS OF THAT DATA IS MOVING IN AGAIN THE SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS JUST CREATED AND MOVED VERY QUICKLY SO IT DEPENDS WHEN YOU PULL THE DATA WHEN YOU ANALYZE IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST GREAT THANK YOU AND REPRESENT OFFICES BEIJING THAT YOU COME FROM -- IT'S VERY TYPICAL WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN ONE COUNTY AND THEN WORKING IN ANOTHER COUNTY SO HOW DO YOU -- SURE THAT THERE'S BALANCE OF EXPECTATIONS BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- SHOULD BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE'S CATCHING KOPET THERE GENERALLY BEING -- TALLIED IN THE COUNTY THEY RESIDED YES SO THE WAY IT WORKS -- WHEN AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE INVESTIGATING CASES IS -- THERE ARE KIND OF SOME JURISDICTIONAL RULES ABOUT THAT SO I IN THAT CASE IN THIS -- IS COUNTED IN THE COUNTY WHERE THEY RESIDE OR IF IT'S A CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT IF THEY WORK IN ANOTHER COUNTY AND THERE'S NO EXPOSURES AT THAT WORK SITE THAN ONE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WILL COMMUNICATE TO THE OTHER HEALTH DEPARTMENT -- MY CASE HEY WORKED AT YOUR COMPANY BE AT HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DATES OF THAT PERSON WAS THERE YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE CONTACT OF THIS OCCASION SO THAT CAN HAPPEN ARE SIMILARLY IF THAT THAT CASE ALSO HAS A CHILD IS IN SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THERE'S A NOTIFICATION IF THERE'S AN EXPOSURE THERE SO THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS AND THEN OFTEN THAT THERE'S A LARGE OUTBREAK THAT'S MULTI JURISDICTIONAL THAT'S WHEN WE AT THE STATE LEVEL OFTEN HELPLESS IN COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION I'M SO SO THAT UP IT'S A GREAT IT'S A GREAT -- LEAD INTO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS REALLY ROUND CONTACT TRACING FONG YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE KEYS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS REALLY HAVING MORE ROBUST CONTACT TRACING HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT THAT'S HAPPENING WE'RE GOING AT THE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL DOESN'T SEEM THE STATE'S IN HERE DOING ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY BUT SOUNDS LIKE THE COUNTIES ARE REALLY THE ONES IMPLEMENTING THAT AND JUST TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THAT -- CONTACT RECENT ELEMENTS GOING YES I KNOW THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WE ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY DID A SURVEY OF ALL OF OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP IT ABSOLUTELY IS A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT FRONTLINE ROLE THAT WE STOOD UP ACTUALLY ANOTHER I. T. SYSTEM WHICH WE ONLY TOUCHED ON TODAY BUT CAL CONNECT WAS STOOD UP VERY QUICKLY AND HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS HAD LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT INPUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING -- AND IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE BASED ON THE USER NEEDS SO -- WE ARE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT I THINK COLLECTIVELY WE DO HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DOING CASE OR CONTACTED THE STATION ACROSS THE STATE NO THAT WAS A BIG GOAL EARLY ON -- WE'RE SEEING BETTER BETTER DATA ABOUT HOW MANY CASES ARE BEING EACH -- AND HOW MANY CONTACTS ARE BEING MET SO -- I THINK THERE'S A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AND WE HAD BEEN AIMING AS A STATE TWENTY FIRST OF THAT UP TO BE AN ABOUT THE LOVE WE ARE NOW TO BE ABLE TO DO CASE CONTACT STATION IT IS LOOKING LIKE WE ARE WE'RE HAVING A GOOD BALANCE THERE OF -- OF COUNTIES BE ABLE TO DO THAT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE WITH THINGS ARE AT THEIR PEAK IN JULY I THINK YOU KNOW AND AS YOU HEARD I'M SURE FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE HEALTH DEPARTMENT THEY WERE NOT NECESSARILY ABLE TO TO DO ALL THAT CONTACT RACING BUT I THINK WE ARE NOT GETTING TO LEVELS WHICH IS AGAIN WHAT WE ALL WANT TO KEEP OUR GUARD UP AND MAINTAIN WHAT WE ARE -- OR EVEN APPROVED OF THAT I THINK WE'RE IN A REALLY MUCH BETTER STATE AS FAR AS CONTACT TRACING OUR STATE GROUP IN IN DO LONG ANTICIPATED AS WE GO INTO THE FLU SEASON AFTER GOING TO THE FALL IN THE WINTER THAT WE'LL SEE ANOTHER WAVE JUST BECAUSE OF THE -- OF THE WAY THE DISEASE GETS SPREAD AND JUST BASED ON THE WEATHER PATTERSON YEAH THANKS I MEAN IT'S OF COURSE A HUGE CONCERN I THINK ONE ENCOURAGING BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MONITOR WITH CAUTION IS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE GENERAL IS LOOK AT THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR CLUES IS NUMBER FOUR YEAH THAT -- AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A VERY VERY MILD FLU SEASON AND OF COURSE THE THEORY IS THAT EVERYONE'S WEARING MASKS OR PHYSICALLY DISTANCE I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY BETTER COMPLIANCE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING BACK FROM OF BUT IT IS A GREAT MAYBE IF ALL OF OUR INTERVENTIONS CAN HELP US PREVENT FLU AND COVER NINETEEN AND THEY ARE TRANSMITTED A VERY SIMILAR WAYS THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE -- AS YOU MANY OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED AS WELL IT'S TRUE THAT THERE'S OFTEN YOU KNOW A SECOND OR THIRD WAVE THAN A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON AGAIN HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE INTERACTING AGAIN SO IT KIND OF CIRCLE BACK TO IF WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR -- YOU KNOW SLOW KIND OF MEASURED RESPONSE AND WATCH AFTER EVERY PHASE AND NOT LET THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TO MAKE IT BUT I THINK THAT IS A CONCERN OF WHY WE ARE WATCHING ALL THESE METRICS INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATIONS HOME AND SEEING WHERE WE ARE AND AND RUNNING PROJECTIONS YOU KNOW PERIODICALLY AS WELL TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE -- BUT WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL IT ALL HAPPENED BUT I CERTAINLY OF COURSE CONCERNED ABOUT WE'RE SEEING ON THE WORLD AS WELL OR EVEN OTHER STATES AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WE STARTED SINCE AGAIN AND I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT US AS A COMMUNITY BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SCHOOL DISTANCING ACTUALLY WHILE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST MENTIONED THERE'S MORE DATA TO MASKING NOT ONLY YOU KNOW EARLY ON WE SET THEM ASKING WAS ONLY PROTECTING THE OTHER PERSON AND NOT YOURSELF THAT THERE'S MORE AND MORE DATA THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS EVERYONE IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE ANOTHER VACCINE AND THAT THERE'S MORE DATA SAYING IT IF PEOPLE ARE WEARING MASKS THEY HAVE LESS SEVERE DISEASE TO SO IT CAN DECREASE AND IT MAKES SENSE -- DECREASED EXPOSURE EVEN IF YOU GET A LITTLE EXPOSE YOU MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY JUST HAVE NO SYMPTOMS OR NOT SIR SO IF WE CAN KEEP THIS UP AND REALLY EXPANDED THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEASURES THAT WE JUST YOU KNOW KEEP SAYING -- I THINK WE COULD WE COULD REALLY TRY TO MITIGATE THIS AND NOT HAVE THAT WEIGHT BUT I THINK WE WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE SEE HOW THAT'S ALL THANK THANK YOU WELL LET'S LET'S LET'S HOPE THAT PEOPLE ON SHORE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO -- FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES WILL HOPE FOR A VERY MILD WINTER IN A MILD FLU SEASON ON WHAT ONE OF THE BIG BIGGEST ISSUES AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS SCHOOLS RE OPENING YOU MENTIONED THAT -- SCHOOLS MOVING INTO REOPEN ARE THERE ARE OTHER GUIDELINES OR PROTOCOLS THAT YOUR GIVING ADVICE TO DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY THE CHALLENGES SCHOOLS AS YOU DON'T HAVE ONE JURISDICTION YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALL IN CHARGE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND I'M SURE THEY ALL HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITED CAPACITY ABOUT EVEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING HOW THEY SHOULD BE DOING IT IN SO -- DO YOU SORT OF -- DETERRED APARTMENT SORT OF OFFER GUIDANCE TO THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR IS IT JUST THAT COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS THAT DOES THAT OR IS IT REALLY ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT JUST TRYING TO GET UNDERSTANDING OF LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY HELP GIVE SCHOOLS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROPERLY AND SAFELY REOPEN SURE -- I THINK IT REALLY IS HAPPENING AT ALL LEVELS I'D SAY ABSOLUTELY AT THE LOCAL HEALTH LEVEL I THINK BECAUSE -- ARE ALL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS -- MANY OF THEM I THINK THEY'RE HAVING YOU KNOW WEEKLY CALLS TO UPDATE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE JUST THE LATEST ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE PANDEMIC AND ALSO ABOUT -- Q.
