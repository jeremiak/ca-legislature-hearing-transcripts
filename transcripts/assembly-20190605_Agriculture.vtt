00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.125
QUICKLY AND WITHOUT MUCH NOTICE.

00:39:54.191 --> 00:40:01.365
AND SAT CREATED A LOT OF

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:01.799
STRUGGLES.

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:02.433
MORE RECENTLY WE HAVE RECEIVED

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.967
SOME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:03.434
DIRECTLY FOR DEFERRED

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.335
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WE GOT

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:04.902
SEVEN MILLION -- TWO FISCAL

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:05.469
YEARS AGO AND WE GOT FOUR

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:06.036
MILLION IN THE MOST RECENT

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.671
FISCAL YEAR.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:10.074
AND THAT COMES IN VERY HANDY ON

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.375
ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES BECAUSE

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:12.943
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS IF I

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.044
HAD A CHANCE I'M SURE THAT

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.279
EVERYBODY HEARS VISITED THEIR

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:16.280
LOCAL FAIRS.

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:17.348
BUT AS YOU GO AROUND TO THESE

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.783
FACILITIES A LOT OF THEM ARE

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:21.085
VERY AGED AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.319
A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.521
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:24.955
AND SO IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.557
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.359
TO USE THESE FOR EMERGENCY

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.727
RESPONSE EFFORTS.

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.562
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S PARAMOUNT

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:32.997
TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN HIS BEST

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.599
A CONDITION AS WE CAN BECAUSE AS

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.368
MY COLLEAGUE MITCHELL TALK ABOUT

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.436
LATER -- ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:42.573
FUNCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.508
NEED TO BE MET AS WE DEPLOY THEM

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:47.077
FOR THOSE PURPOSES -- ARE VERY

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:49.313
VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU REALLY

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.182
CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THIS

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.150
REPAIRED Và FACILITIES AND TO

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:54.385
BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EXPECTATION

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.085
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.821
SUCCESSFUL IN CARRYING OUT THIS

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:57.655
EMERGENCY MISSION.

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:59.023
AS A WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.457
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT THAT WE

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:00.991
RECEIVED FOR THE DEFERRED

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.226
MAINTENANCE.

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.862
AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AB

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:05.462
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE THAT SET

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.698
ASIDE THREE FOUR SO 1% OF SALES

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.066
TAX PROCEEDS THAT COULD BE

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.467
ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAIR GROUNDS.

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:12.136
AND THAT'S GENERATED -- THE LAST

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.904
ESTIMATE I HEARD WAS ABOUT

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.272
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THEY

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.707
CAN ALSO COME BACK TOWARDS THESE

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:17.508
FAIR GROUNDS FOR DEFERRED

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:19.176
MAINTENANCE AND THEN ALSO THAT

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.111
MONEY CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.546
THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT.

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:24.081
I'M JUST A QUICKOVERVIEW OF THE

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.749
FAIRS I KNOW YOU HAVE THIS

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.184
MATERIAL IN YOUR PACKETS -- BUT

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.219
THE DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.954
ASSOCIATIONS MAKE UP THE BULK OF

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.121
THOSE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:32.022
THAT ARE UNDERNEATH --

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:33.490
DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG AS FAR AS

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:34.992
OUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:36.594
GOES ON THESE ARE STATE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.163
FACILITIES FORTY ONE OF THEM ARE

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.397
STATE OWNED -- OTHER ONES HAVE

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.232
DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS LIKE

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:45.402
LEAST FROM A LOCALITY OR SOME

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.838
OTHER PARTY.

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.907
AND THIRD DISPERSED.

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.075
ALL OVER THE STATE AND SO THAT'S

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:51.909
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:52.576
TO THEIR SUCH GOOD ASSETS IN AN

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:53.711
EMERGENCY RESPONSES BECAUSE YOU

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.179
NEVER KNOW WHEN EMERGENCIES CAN

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:56.213
OCCUR.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.047
AND FRANKLY YOU DON'T EVEN

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.549
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EMERGENCY

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.150
IS GOING TO REQUIRE AND TILL YOU

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:02.286
DEPLOY AND YOU START ASSESSING

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.420
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:05.122
WILDFIRESOBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GONNA

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:07.291
LOOK FOR THE NEAREST LOCATIONS

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.692
TO BE ABLE TO STAGE EQUIPMENT

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.361
MOVE EVACUEES MOVE ANIMALS THAT

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.029
ARE DISPLACED.

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:15.366
THINGS LIKE THAT -- BUT IT WAS

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:17.001
ONLY SO. THREE YEARS AGO NOW

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.203
THAT WE HAVE THE OROVILLE DAM --

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.838
SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS THE

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.606
POSSIBILITY OF HAPPENING

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:23.908
CATASTROPHIC BREACH OF THAT.

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.442
AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD GO TO

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.744
THE NEAREST FAIRGROUND AND SO

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.112
THEY HAD TO LOOK -- QUITE A BIT

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.513
FARTHER OUTSIDE THE REGION TO

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.048
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FAIRGROUNDS

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:33.183
BECAUSE THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.351
THE EVACUATION OF THE AND THEN

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:36.153
ALSO THE SPECTER OF WHAT COULD

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.022
HAPPEN IF WE STARTED TO

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.590
EXPERIENCE THAT FAILURE.

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:40.824
AND SO THAT'S WHY I SAY IT'S

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.860
IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED THING

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.662
THERE IS NO EASY ANSWERS ON A

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.563
SIGNING FAIRS OR YOU KNOW PRE

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.265
POSITIONING A LOT OF OF OF

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:50.067
EQUIPMENT AND ASSETS TO BE READY

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.502
FOR THINGS ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:53.170
IMPORTANT TOOLS TO DO.

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:54.571
AND SO WHAT WE DO AS A

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:59.510
DEPARTMENT IS AS WERE ORGANIZED --

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:00.077
TO DEPLOY ALL OF THIS VERY

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.879
QUICKLY WE HAVE A DEDICATED

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.114
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.416
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A DEDICATED

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.784
BRANCH THAT PROVIDES THE OTHER

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.953
AREAS OF OVERSIGHT FOR THE FAIRS

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:09.787
AND EXPOSITIONS.

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:10.955
WE HAVE AFFAIRS AN EXPOSITION

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:12.790
FUND THAT FUNDS -- SOME OF THE

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.491
SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE MORE

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.193
FISCALLY STRUGGLING FAIRS.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.062
AS WELL AS HE HANDLES ALL THE

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.063
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES WITH

00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:20.331
GETTING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.699
MONIES OUT THERE AND VERIFYING

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.067
THE PROJECTS AND THINGS OF THAT

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:23.801
SORT.

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.536
AND THE STAFF ALSO GO INTO A

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.071
DIFFERENT MODE WHEN THEY DO GET

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:29.139
ACTIVATED DURING AN EMERGENCY

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:30.307
PERIOD.

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:31.342
AND THEY BECOME A VITAL LINK IN

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.177
THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDING

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:34.511
INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE FAIR

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:37.548
GROUNDS -- TO YES AS WELL AS ALL

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:38.315
THE LOCALS THAT MIGHT NEED SOME

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:40.351
OF THAT INFORMATION EVERYTHING

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.852
FROM WHAT TYPE.

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.721
OF FACILITIES DO YOU HAVE WHAT'S

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.922
THE CAPACITY WOULD OF THE SIZE

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:47.925
OF SOME OF THE BUILDINGS A

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:49.126
DIFFERENT THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.327
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.729
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THIS.

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:52.663
AND ANOTHER THING TO NOTE JUST

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.498
TO KEEP ALL THIS IN CONTEXT IS

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:56.300
THAT ADDS TO THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.034
FAIRS.

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:59.336
IS THE TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION OF

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.405
A FAIR IS IS A ONE TIME FARE OF

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.773
AND USUALLY IN GOOD WEATHER

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.408
HOPEFULLY NOT TOO OFF THOUGH

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.143
BECAUSE SOMETIMES SECOND.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.578
NOT YOUR ATTENDANCE DOWN.

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:09.847
IN SOME FAIRS ARE MORE ACTIVE

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:10.514
AND THEY HAVE A CHANCE HAPPENING

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.448
PRETTY FREQUENTLY THEY'LL HAVE

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:14.618
CAR SHOWS OR THINGS LIKE THAT OR

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.320
THE ANIMAL EVENTS WHERE THEY

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.654
SHALL LIVE STALKER.

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.689
THE THINGS LIKE THAT IN SO

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:21.058
PEOPLE FORGET THAT THAT

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:22.893
EMERGENCY FUNCTION OF FAIRS THAT

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.195
THAT ASSET IS AVAILABLE THE REST

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.196
OF THE TIME.

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.132
BUT ALSO THE COMPLEXITY AS AS

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:29.500
WITH THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:30.634
EMERGENCIES AND WHEN YOU DO

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.136
DEPLOY AFFAIR.

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:34.571
THEN YOU HAVE TO THROW IN WHY

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:35.439
THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR FAIR

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:36.974
VANCE OR OTHER EVENTS THAT THEY

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.509
MIGHT HAVE SCHEDULED.

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:40.911
THAT VERY MUCH UNDER RIGHT THERE

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.046
FISCAL VIABILITY.

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.847
AND SO SOMETIMES WE LOSE SIGHT

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:46.083
OF THAT AND A LOT OF ACTIVITY

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.718
HAPPENS DURING AN EMERGENCY.

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.652
AND SO FROM OUR DEPARTMENT'S

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:49.987
PERSPECTIVE WE TRY TO BALANCE

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:50.888
ALL OF THOSE NEEDS AND THAT'S

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.256
WHY WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.191
THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.659
AND WITH ALL THE VARIOUS FAIRS

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.127
OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.662
THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE

00:44:58.729 --> 00:44:59.997
KNOWN BY EVERYBODY AND THAT THE

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.532
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE OPEN

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:02.733
SO THAT THE INFORMATION.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.068
CAN FLOW FREELY AND EVERYBODY

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.769
CAN MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:07.471
WHAT'S THE THE BEST WAY TO

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.739
RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY.

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:13.744
AND UTILIZE THE FAIR IN THE BEST

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.379
MANNER AVAILABLE -- WITHOUT

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.380
ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:17.014
FROM -- YES TO DRILL INTO MORE

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:18.382
SPECIFICS ABOUT EMERGENCY

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.417
RESPONSE AND HOW THE FAIRGROUNDS

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:21.618
FIT IN WITHOUT WITH SOME FAIRLY

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:22.920
SPECIFIC DETAILS OF WHAT THAT

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:23.654
LOOKS LIKE.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.556
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:27.925
THANK YOU KEVIN -- AND THANK YOU

GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY AND AND

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:34.498
TALK ABOUT CRITICAL -- TOPIC

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:39.336
IT'S IMPORTANT TO US -- IT GOES

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:40.137

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.640
FIRSTHAND BUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:44.274
THIRTEEN WE'VE HAD PRESS TWELVE

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:48.545
PRESIDENTIAL -- MAJOR DISASTER --

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:50.080
DECLARATIONS HAVE FOR THE STATE

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.748
AND TO ACHIEVE THAT NUMBER MEANS

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.283
IN A WERE ALWAYS IN EXCESS OF

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.618
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.286
JUST TO GET TO THAT THRESHOLD TO

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:57.788
QUALIFY SO THIS IS.

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.223
AN EXCEPTIONAL TIME AND AND

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.658
THERE WAS A TIME AND PLACE WHEN.

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:03.193
VERY FEW FAIRGROUND -- MANAGERS

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.496
WERE IN FACT PROFICIENT AT

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.998
HAVING TO USE -- AND ALL OF THE

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.700
DISASTER -- AREAS THAT WE'RE

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.935
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE.

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.037
THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE NOW --

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.339
JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:16.073
HAVE FORTY THREE DIFFERENT

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.941
FAIRGROUNDS -- THAT WERE USED

00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:20.644
AND UTILIZED OUT THERE SO WE

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.012
START TALKING ABOUT --

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.313
SHELTERING OPERATIONS WHICH IS

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.682
USUALLY THE PRIMARY PIECE THAT --

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.151
COMES UP AS AS WE CAN WITH OF

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:28.318
ACTIVITIES.

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.119
BUT BEFORE THAT THEY'RE STARTING

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:30.787
TO BE USED TO STAGING AREAS

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.823
RIGHT AWAY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS --

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.825
WE START MOVING -- SUPPLIES

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:37.194
MATERIALS THERE FOR THEM WE USE

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.028
MISS POINT TO DISTRIBUTION

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:40.063
CENTERS -- THERE'S JUST A

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:43.267
MULTITUDE OF REASONS THAT WE USE --

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.002
THE FAIRGROUNDS NOW AS PART OF

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:47.538
OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:48.705
EFFORTS OF FOR US.

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:50.440
I WAS PLEASED TO SEE ON THE

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:54.044
AGENDA -- MANY OF THE THE

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:54.678
REPRESENTATIVES COME TO TALK TO

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:55.779
US BECAUSE JUST LOOKING BACK

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.114
RECENTLY HERE WITH DIXON AND

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:59.650
SILVER DOLLAR AND NAPA AND BUTTE --

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.685
ALL OF THEM ANSWERED THE CALL --

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.020
WHEN WE NEEDED THEM -- THEY WERE

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:05.789
QUICK TO RESPOND AND TO OPEN

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.124
THEIR ARMS AND BE PART OF THE

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:07.891
SOLUTION.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.493
WHAT WE CALL THE WHOLE OF

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.229
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TAKES PLACE --

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:17.134
FOR THESE DISASTERS SO FOR US.

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.936
HAVING SAID ALL THAT I DO I DO

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:19.803
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME AREAS

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.672
THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WERE

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:22.339
AND WE CAN MOVE PROVED IT'S AND

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.874
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.842
IMPORTANT TELL YOU WERE -- WE

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:28.145
WERE CAN IN HAND WITH -- CDFA --

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:29.680
ON A REGULAR BASIS AND TALK

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.315
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TRENDS THAT

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:34.751
WE HAVE SEEN SO -- DURING.

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:35.852
AND THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:36.887
JUST WANNA GIVE SOME GOOD

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:37.888
GENERALIZATION SO.

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.523
MANY THERE IS WE GO TO SOON AS

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.390
WE GET -- START DEALING WITH

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:42.426
SHELTERING OPERATIONS -- WITHIN

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.394
THE WITHIN THE FAIRGROUNDS -- WE

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.296
START SEEING SOME ADA COMPLIANCE

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.065
ISSUES THAT ARE THEIR THEIR

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:48.599
CHALLENGE FORCE WEATHERED

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:51.201
SHOWERS -- BATHROOMS -- AND

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:52.302
OTHER FACILITIES WICH ARE

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.137
AUGMENTING THOSE RIGHT AWAY WITH

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.039
PORTABLES BUT THERE'S A TIME AND

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:59.743
AND AND OBVIOUSLY -- A TIME

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.811
COMPONENT THAT HAS TO BE THERE

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:02.179
TOGETHER STUFF MOVED IN AND

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:02.813
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.081
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.349
AND BROUGHT INTO SITES -- BUT

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:06.817
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WORK ON

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.685
AGGRESSIVELY AND THEN --

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:09.753
ACTUALLY EVERY TIME WE HAVE A

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.921
DISASTER WE DISPATCH SOMEBODY

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:12.889
FROM OUR OFFICE IT'S AN EIGHTY

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:14.191
SPECIALIST AND GOES OFF THEIR

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:14.758
SHORES LOOKING RIGHT AWAY.

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.460
AND WE START WORKING WITH OUR

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:19.730
PARTNERS AT CDSS CDFA AMERICAN

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.632
RED CROSS AND OTHERS -- FEMA AND

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:22.266
START TRYING TO BRING RESOURCES

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:26.570
AND TO AUGMENT THEM.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.605
ANOTHER AREA THAT -- WE SEE --

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:29.773
THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE ONE IS IS

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.675
THE COLOCATION AT SHELTERS WITH

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.677
PETS AND ANIMALS SO -- TO

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.345
FASTENING DISCUSSION BECAUSE

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:36.980
WHAT WAS TRADITIONALLY A CAT AND

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:39.149
DOG -- THIS KIND OF OPENED UP

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.717
AND YOU HAVE A MORPHING OF OF

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.953
WHAT IS YOUR PET AND AND WHAT DO

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.987
YOU WANT THEIR HOW WHAT

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:46.123
ALLERGIES DO YOU HAVE -- HOW DO

00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:47.991
YOU REACT RUN THOSE ANIMALS --

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.926
AND SO -- WHAT WE SEE IS A LOT

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:51.728
OF FOLKS THAT BRING THEIR CARS

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.030
FOR TRAILERS IN -- WE SELL IT

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:54.264
REPETITIVELY THEIR PARKING IN

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.465
THE PARKING LOT FOR TAKING

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.067
ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICES THE

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.102
MEALS SHOWERS EVERYTHING ELSE

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.404
BUT MANY CASES ARE SLEEPING IN

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.605
THEIR TRAILER OR THEIR CAR

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:02.539
BECAUSE THEIR PETS FOR THEIR AND

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.274
ARE KEEPING THEIR WITH THEM --

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:06.276
FOR THAT SO -- WE CONTINUE TO

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:07.544
WORK THAT TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.346
SOLUTION THE RIGHT ANSWER IT'S

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.947
HARD -- JUST IN A IN A GROUP

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:12.983
SETTING WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE --

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.518
ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND IN AN

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:15.952
EMERGENCY THERE'S ALREADY ENOUGH

00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:17.721
STRESS AND SO.

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.356
WHAT CAN BE GOOD IT CAN ALSO BE --

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:21.124
A CHALLENGE FOR OTHERS AND SO

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.092
FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IS

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.327
SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE US

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:26.997
SERIOUSLY AND ARE ALWAYS WORKING

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.465
FOR A GOOD SOLUTION.

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.801
ON THE OTHER AREA -- FOR US IS

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:31.868
THAT -- WIFI INTERNET -- IT'S

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:32.469
NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOMEBODY TO

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:33.470
COME OUT AND NOT HAVE ANYTHING

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:34.504
OTHER THAN.

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:38.775
OTHER SMARTPHONE ON THEM AND SO --

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:39.976
FEW HOURS THAT PHONE MIGHT NOT

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:42.045
BE CHARGED AND SO WE'VE BEEN

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:42.646
WORKING AGGRESSIVELY WITH OUR

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:44.481
CARRIERS AND THEY TEND TO BRING

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.616
IN CHARGING STATIONS FOR US TO

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:48.819
BRING IN A WIFI HOTSPOT --

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:51.021
USUALLY CALL THE CULTURE CALLOUS

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:54.191
SELLING TOWER A LIGHT TRUCK HER

00:49:54.257 --> 00:50:00.464
CELL ON I WE'LL SEE IN A CAO CAO.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.031
AND THEY'LL TURN AROUND THE

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:01.431
BRING THOSE IN.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.933
THEY WORK OKAY -- JUST DEPENDS

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.301
ON THE POPULATION DENSITY IS

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:05.969
HAVE THERE SO -- IF IT'S A

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:07.771
REALLY -- IMPACTED FAIRGROUND

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:08.872
AND THEN THAT THAT CONNECTIVE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.207
ITTY IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.843
SLOW IT'S LIGHT AND AND SMALL

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:14.845
AND THEY WORK FINE -- FOR THE

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:16.513
SMALL NUMBER THERE SO -- BUT

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.080
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:18.615
OBVIOUSLY BE BETTER BECAUSE WHEN

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.249
YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH YOUR

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.684
INSURANCE CARRIER TALKING YOUR

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.052
FAMILY AND FRIENDS -- HAVING

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:23.520
GOOD CONNECTIVITY IS OBVIOUSLY

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:27.591
IMPORTANT -- FOR EVERYBODY

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.627
THAT'S USED IN THE SITE -- REAL

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.028
HANDLING EQUIPMENT SO IT'S NOT

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:32.763
JUST LIKE IN A CONTROL START

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:33.730
DROPPING SUPPLIES RIGHT AWAY

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.699
INTO AN AREA THAT THEY DON'T

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.968
HAVE BALLOTS -- PALLET TRUCK

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.503
JACK'S -- FORKLIFTS THE ABILITY

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.405
TO MOVE THAT MATERIAL AROUND AND

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.540
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT ON THAT CAN

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.875
CREATE A DELAY THERE SO -- WE

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:47.244
JUST SEE A WIDE VARIANCE OF OF

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.145
PREPARATIONS AT EACH SITE THAT

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:49.079
WERE OPERATING AND SOME ARE

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.714
BETTER PREPARED THAN OTHERS AND

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.882
HAVE BETTER RESOURCES AND THEN

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:52.449
FINALLY.

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:54.117
I WOULD SAY -- SYSTEM

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:57.254
INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS POINTED OUT --

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.389
BY KEVIN YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.257
ARE MANY CASES THERE'S DEFERRED

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:00.924
MAINTENANCE THERE SO IF YOU HAVE

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.627
A PROBLEM WITH -- INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:07.130
WITH WATER OR WITH SEWER OR WITH --

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.866
POWER OUR H. BACK -- ESPECIALLY

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.301
A HOT DAY LIKE IT IS TODAY --

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.136
THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE -- FOR

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:17.607
THE EVACUEES ARE THOSE ARE USING

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:20.410
THE SITE.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.411
SO AFTER EACH DISASTER WE SIT

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.046
DOWN AND WE GET WITH OUR OUR

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.614
PARTNERS AND WE START WORKING ON

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.817
AN AFTER ACTION REPORT AND WE

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:27.818
MERELY START FIGURE OUT WHERE IS

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:28.785
IF THERE IS A WE CAN IMPROVE AND

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:29.719
WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.254
AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:33.256
THAT -- AND START LOOKING FOR

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.625
SOLUTIONS IN TRYING TO GUIDE --

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.494
OUR PARTNER AGENCIES AND THOSE

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.395
THAT WERE WORKING WITH EITHER

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:41.031
THAT STORE GRANT OR THROUGH

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:42.766
ANOTHER FUN SOURCES THAT ARE

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:43.400
THERE OR FOR YOURSELVES

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:44.935
OBVIOUSLY AND ANYTHING THAT CAN

00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:45.769
BRING.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.103
ON IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF THE

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.705
READINESS OF THESE FAIRGROUND SO

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.941
THAT -- WHEN WE DO NEED THEM --

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:53.944
THAT THEY'RE IN AN OPTIMAL SHAPE --

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.812
FOR USAGE -- WHAT?

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.013
IN ADDITION TO WHAT I POINTED

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.814
OUR SOME THERE IS IMPROVEMENT

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.516
HERE IS THAT -- ARE WORKING WELL

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.451
GOOD COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT NOW --

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.019
IT'S AMAZING HOW HOW WELL --

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.322
THAT'S WORKING ON HOW QUICKLY

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.189
WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.024
THEIR ONE A LOT OF PREPARATION

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.326
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR SITE MAP SOME

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:10.861
LAYOUTS THAT REDUCES TIME INTO

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.562
SO -- DISORGANIZATION AT THE

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.697
BEGINNING OF THE RESPONSE EFFORT

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.532
BECAUSE THEY'VE MAPPED OUT WHERE

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.833
THEY WANT RESOURCES TO GO --

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.268
WHEN YOU COME INTO A THE

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.903
FAIRGROUNDS THAT'S A GREAT AREA

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.505
AND THEN THERE'S BEEN -- AN

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.205
INCREASED AMOUNT OF TRAINING

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:24.040
THAT WE'VE SEEN -- AT THE

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.809
VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PART OF

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:26.810
THAT IS OF COURSE IN THE

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.578
INCREASED ACTIVITY -- THAT WE'VE

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.413
HADHERE IN THE STATE -- SO

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.415
THOSE KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND SO

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:34.451
THAT PROFICIENCIES LED -- TO

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:36.653
MORE EXPERTISE AND THEREFORE HAS

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.992
REDUCED A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT --

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:44.361
YOU SEE THERE -- WE CONTINUE TO

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:45.228
DO TRAINING TOGETHER -- WE DID

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.563
LAST YEAR WE DID -- THE YELLOW

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.465
COMMAND EXERCISE AT THE BAY AREA

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:50.066
AND AND WE USED TO OUR FOR OUR

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:51.234
PERSON IS THERE AND THEN -- CFA

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.335
LEAD SO WHAT WE CALL EMERGENCY

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.437
SUPPORT FUNCTION -- ELEVEN IT'S

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:56.640
A CRITICAL -- SUPPORT FUNCTION

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:57.707
IT'S PART OF OUR A STATE

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.109
EMERGENCY PLANNING AND AND HOW

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:00.977
WE PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY AND

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.546
A COORDINATED RESPONSE IN THERE

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:03.780
THE PRIMARY LEAD.

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:06.416
UP FOR THAT WITH THE

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.718
STAKEHOLDERS THEIR THEIR HAVING

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:09.352
SAID THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.987
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.990
AND MOVE FURTHER THANK YOU.

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.091
THANK YOU SO DO YOU HAVE LIKE

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:17.060
BEST PRACTICES THAT YOU HAVE

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.361
COORDINATED TOGETHER.

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:20.297
AND I KNOW -- IN TWO THOUSAND

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.565
TEN CDFA THEY DID A REPORT ON

00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:23.233
FAIRS AND DISASTER AND HAD ABOUT

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.801
A DOZEN RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.603
HOW HOW IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.638
GOING OR ISN'T IS IT EVEN STILL

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.907
RELEVANT SOME ALMOST A DECADE

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:32.542
LATER AS WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE?

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.144
I THINK WHAT'S RELEVANT IS

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.812
LOOKING AT THAT FRAMEWORK OF

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.113
IDENTIFYING SOME OF THESE

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.848
DEFICIENT AREAS AND THEN WORKING

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:39.883
COLLABORATIVELY WITH BOTH

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.618
AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THAT AND

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.320
COME UP WITH WAYS THAT WE FEEL

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.654
WOULD MITIGATE THAT.

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.889
AND WE ACTUALLY DID LOOK BACK

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.757
OVER THAT IN A LOT OF THOSE

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.360
AREAS HAD BEEN ADDRESSED -- ONE

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:51.394
OF THINGS THAT ALSO HAPPENS ON A

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:52.963
ROUTINE BASIS AND THIS IS

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.497
ACTUALLY MULTI AGENCY.

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:55.799
IS IS THAT THERE'S ADVISORY

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.233
COMMITTEE MEETINGS HELD OUT AT

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.302
THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.704
FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.871
AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.173
CONTINUAL DIALOGUE IN AN

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.374
EXAMINATION OF THE BEST

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.409
PRACTICES ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.011
DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMERGENCY

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:08.912
SCENARIOS.

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.914
OF WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE PLAY A BIG

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.515
ROLE BECAUSE OF THE FAIRGROUNDS --

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.517
BUT ALSO ANY OF THEM THAT MIGHT

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.086
INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF A FOOD

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:18.121
PRODUCTION OR AGRICULTURAL

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:20.490
ISSUES AND HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:21.524
THEM.

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:22.859
AND SO LIKE I SAY I MEAN THAT'S

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.260
A MULTI AGENCY EFFORT WE ATTEND

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.328
THOSE MEETINGS I BELIEVE

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:26.529
QUARTERLY.

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:27.163
AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.999
AGENCIES COME TOGETHER SO THE

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.533
WHOLE EFFORT OF EXAMINING BEST

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.802
PRACTICES AND HAVING GOOD ROBUST

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:34.104
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:38.108
OCCURS ACROSS A LOT OF THE

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:38.675
DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND STATE

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:39.576
GOVERNMENT.

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.111
AND AND I WOULD ECHO THAT --

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.312
MANY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.047
TAKEN HEART AND ADDRESSED --

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.215
THERE THERE'S A FEW THAT.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.916
HAD NOT BUT FOR THE MOST PART

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.418
THEY'VE ALL BEEN ADDRESS FORMAT

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:48.785
AND THEN FROM.

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.487
AS THE GROUP TECHNOLOGY AND

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:52.689
ORDERS RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY IS

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:53.323
CHANGE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.191
WE HAD.

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.926
AND REALLY THE FOCUS -- THERE'S

00:54:56.993 --> 00:54:58.361
IN THAT PRIMARY CORE COMPETENCY

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.030
THAT THEY DEAL WITH -- FOR

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:02.232
ANIMALS AND THAT IS A CORE

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:04.401
KAPATID AT THAT -- A SEE IF IT

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.536
HAS TO BE A READY -- FOR BUT WE

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.505
SEEN SUCH A A LARGE USAGE ON

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:10.340
THOSE OTHER AREAS -- THAT'S KIND

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.876
OF CHANGED -- THAT SHIFT AND SO

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.444
WE'VE OF MADE A A GREATER FOCUS

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.645
TOGETHER AND AND MEETING

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:19.849
REGULARLY AND WE'RE TO CONTINUE

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.351
TRAINING AND ADDRESSES ISSUES.

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:22.585
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOCALS

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.854
COME UP AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.356
THEIR EXPERIENCE AS WELL SO I

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:26.956
MEAN SITTING UP HERE FROM THE

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:28.725
STATE LEVEL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.860
WOULD BE THE ISSUE THEIR BIGGEST.

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.896
THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT. TO HOW

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.264
THE THIS INTERACTION WITH THE

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.766
STATE GOES AND THEIR BIGGEST

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:37.400
COMPLAINT ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:40.103
BETTER.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.138
WHAT YOU START?

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:42.872
JUMP IN.

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:43.273
WELL THE BIGGEST.

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:44.607
COMPLIMENT IS IS HAVING THE

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:45.542
ACCESSIBILITY AND THE RAPID

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.277
NISSEN WHICH WE CAN GET THE

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:49.112
ASSET DEPLOYED AND BEGIN THE

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.580
ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WE CAN JUST

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.382
DEAL DIRECTLY WITH SOMEBODY WHO

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.217
IS THERE UNDERSTANDS THE

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:55.585
CONDITIONS OF THE CAPABILITIES.

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.120
AND CAN ALSO RESPOND TO THOSE

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.022
INITIAL FLURRY OF QUESTIONS THAT

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:00.056
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AS

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:02.859
TO WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:05.195
THINGS LIKE THAT -- AS FAR AS

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:06.763
WHAT I WOULD SEE IS SOMETHING

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.865
THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:11.167
WOULD BE I THINK PROBABLY AT THE

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:13.336
STATE LEVEL HAVING A BETTER

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.305
UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.207
LOCAL CHALLENGES THAT THEY MIGHT

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.441
FACE.

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:21.411
AND A LOT OF TIMES WE END UP

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:22.612
DEALING WITH SOME OF THOSE

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.447
CHALLENGES AT THE SAME TIME

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:25.815
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE EMERGENCY

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:27.217
WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.686
ENVIRONMENT -- FORGE OUT SOME

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:31.855
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AGREEABLE TO

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.923
EVERYBODY ON MOVING FORWARD.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.291
AND SO I GUESS IF I WAS GONNA

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:36.760
SAY ONE THING WE COULD DO A

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.528
BETTER JOB OF THIS IS IN BETWEEN

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:40.130
INCIDENTS.

00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:41.064
IS IS.

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:42.499
TO HAVE A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.567
IN PLACE WERE CONTINUALLY HAVING

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:45.935
THAT DIALOGUE THAT'S NOT

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.704
NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON AFTER

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.372
ACTION FROM THE LAST EVENT OR

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.374
SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:52.408
IS WHAT MIGHT BE IN OF THAT BUT

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:53.743
JUST IN GENERAL.

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.044
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS WORKING AT

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.379
THAT FAIR GROUND IN OUR THEIR

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:57.814
CHALLENGES LOCALLY THAT WE THINK

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.349
MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:00.583
KNOW SO THAT ONCE WE DO GET INTO

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.951
THAT ENVIRONMENT OF RESPONDING

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.052
TO AN EMERGENCY.

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.921
THAT WERE AWARE OF IT COGNIZANT

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:07.257
OF IT AND CAN.

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.224
YOU KNOW MOVE WITH A LITTLE BIT

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:09.425
BETTER CLASS MOVES NESS IF YOU

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:13.763
WILL TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:14.631
NEED TO DO.

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:15.899
AND WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.300
IN PLACE THAT EVERY GROUNDS HAS

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.468
LIKE A EMERGENCY PLAN BUT

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:19.135
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IF SOMETHING

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.471
HAPPENS LIKE A PRE ASSESSMENT

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:21.938
APPROACH.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.273
OR IS IT THAT THE MERGE THESE

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:24.474
TWO FLUID TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT --

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:26.476
I WOULD SAY EMERGENCIES MIGHT BE

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.844
A LITTLE TOO FLUID THERE'S

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.380
EVERYBODY HAS PLANS IN PLACE.

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:32.282
AND I'VE NEGLECTED TO MENTION

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.883
EARLIER TO THAT WE PUT OF MAY

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.318
REVISED PROPOSAL AND THAT

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:36.853
INCLUDES A COMPONENT FOR US TO

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.887
INCREASE OUR FOOTPRINT THE

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:40.256
ANIMAL CARES ARENA WHICH IS ALSO

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:41.558
RESPONSIBILITY OF OURS -- BUT

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.859
THROUGH BUDGET ISSUES OVER THE

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:45.428
PAST FEW YEARS WE HADTO REDUCE

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:47.330
SOME OF OUR STAFFING RESOURCES

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:49.199
THERE WE OPERATED IT BY TAPPING

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.800
INTO EXPERTISE AROUND THE

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.168
DEPARTMENT WORD EXISTED.

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.770
WHICH WORKS FOR THE MOST PART

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.872
UNTIL IT DOESN'T AND HONESTLY

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:58.174
CAMP SHOWED US THAT IT DID WORK

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:59.642
THAT WELL BECAUSE WE HAD -- A

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.844
FOREIGN ANIMAL DISEASE THAT

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.212
STILL ON GOING DOWN IN SOUTHERN

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:04.147
CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAD A LOT OF

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.748
PEOPLE DEDICATED.

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.150

DEVELOPMENT UPDATING OF ALL

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:24.868
THESE DIFFERENT PLANS OF WHICH

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.269
THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT IN THE

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:27.937
FAIRGROUNDS IS HOW ARE WE GONNA

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:28.905
SHELTER ANIMALS.

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.106
ARE WE GONNA HANDLE THEM WHAT

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.242
TYPES OF ANIMALS IN AS MITCHELL

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:34.043
MENTIONED EARLIER JUST ASSESSING

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.545
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES WITH

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.213
WHEN YEAR COHABITATING DIFFERENT

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.149
TYPES OF ANIMALS LARGE AND SMALL

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:40.817
AND YOU KNOW.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:41.985
WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.152
WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE BEST

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.921
PRACTICES TO HAVE IN PLACE TO BE

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.990
ABLE TO DO THAT AS BEST WE CAN

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.625
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.326
AND SO WE'RE KEEPING OUR FINGERS

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.361
CROSSED THAT.

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:53.062
ARE PROPOSAL AS SUBMITTED WILL

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.230
BECOME PART OF THE ENACTED

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.231
BUDGET AND WILL BEGIN THE HIRING

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:57.233
PROCESS AND HAVE THOSE RESOURCES

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.534
AVAILABLE SO THEY'LL DEFINITELY

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.103
BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:01.204
ALL THE DIFFERENT FAIRS LOOKING

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.505
AT THESE PLANS AND HELPING THEM

00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:07.143
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:07.310
BE.

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:10.480
READY.

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:11.047
AND I WOULD.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.215
CLING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:13.449
THAT I THINK -- IN ANOTHER

00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:15.551
FAIRGROUNDS WANT TO FAIL THEY

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:16.319
THEY WANT TO PUT THE BEST FOOT

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.654
FORWARD A LEGITIMATE IN THE

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.154
OTHER TRYING AND WE'VE.

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.289
TAX THEM IN WAYS THAT WE HAD NOT

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.490
SEEN BEFORE AND YOU LOOK AT

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:21.891
DIXON AND WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.192
WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.428
HOSPITAL AND AND WITH -- THE

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:27.297
UNIQUE -- CHALLENGES THAT THEY

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.065
FACE AND SOME OF THE LONG TERM

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.967
HOUSING THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:32.368
IN SOME LOCATIONS -- WE'RE

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.203
ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAVE THE SITE

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.338
IN BETTER CONDITION THAT WE HAD

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:38.341
IT -- BUT THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:39.776
THEM AND I THINK THEY I THINK.

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.945
THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY LOVE TO

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:44.013
HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO HAVE A A

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.315
BETTER CONDITION SO THAT THEIR

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.649
SET I MEAN THAT'S JUST.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:47.450
OF FORT.

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.619
BUT YOU CAN GO MANY YEARS

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:50.253
WITHOUT HAVING ANY ISSUES LIKE

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:50.486
WE DID.

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:52.755
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:54.023
THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND ALL OF A

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.025
SUDDEN -- BELIEVE TAKEOVER LIKE

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.094
WE'VE HAD NOW AND IT'S JUST BEEN.

00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:01.030
ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SO -- YOU

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:01.931
KNOW HOW YOU YOU KNOW WHERE THAT

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:02.899
WHERE THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE AND

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.067
AND HOW THEY CAN DO IT.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.436
AND THEN OF COURSE THE AS SECOND

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.237
POINT OUT LOS REVENUE IS A

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.872
CHALLENGE -- FOR THE FAIRGROUNDS

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:10.974
IT'S TOUGH AND MEAN OBVIOUSLY

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.242
WERE RENTING IT AT A FAIR RATE

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.577
WHEN WE COME IN RENTS SPACE OUT

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.179
AND SET UP LEASES -- WITH THE

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:23.486
SITES BUT IN THE THIRD THERE'S

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.120
OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT THEY'VE

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.621
LOST AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.724
SO -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT SAYS

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.025
AS CHALLENGE FOR THEM WHEN THAT

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:29.892
HAPPENS COURSE ARE DEALING WITH

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.194
PEOPLE HAVE LOST EVERYTHING SO

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.261
YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUT HOW

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:32.762
I TAKE CARE OF MY LOCAL

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.129
COMMUNITY WHO.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:35.198
HAS LOST THEIR HOMES WITH OKAY

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.366
HAVE LOST A POTENTIAL REVENUE

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.734
TIME IN THERE AND SO I WE

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.735
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:39.702
ON THE STRUGGLES IN THE

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.504
CHALLENGES AND EMOTIONAL --

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:42.705
COMPONENT THAT.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:43.740
AND I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE US

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.541
TO PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB ON

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:47.443
POST EVENT WHEN WE'RE TRYING --

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.246
TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS -- IN A

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.748
SOMETIMES THERE'S A DELAY IN

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.415
THERE'S A CHALLENGE WITH CERTAIN

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.517
FOLKS FOR LEADING OTHER SHELTERS

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:58.955
AND HOW THAT'S COMMUNICATED IN --

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.456
ELIGIBILITY AND FOR THOSE THAT

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.724
ARE -- NOT NECESSARILY THAT

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:02.792
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SERVICES ALL

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:03.893
THE WAY TO THE VERY VERY END.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.430
AND ARE I'M SLOW -- TO EXTRACT

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:12.135
THEMSELVES ON TO SAY THAT.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.803
THE QUESTIONS MISTER CHOI.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.571

AND I WENT THROUGH FLOODS AND

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:24.747
EARTHQUAKES AND WHY THINGS WE

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.749
DIDN'T REALLY PREPARE.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:29.752

AND WE WEREN'T REALLY PREPARED

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:41.130
BECAUSE NOBODY EVER THOUGHT.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.165
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THAT

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:45.034
MAGNITUDE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.370
MESSES UP OR YOU KNOW WE WE

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:48.004

WEIRD NOW BUT IT WAS A TIME IN

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:53.443
THE EIGHTIES WHERE.

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:55.011

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.979
SANDBAGS TO STOP LOS ANGELES

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:01.517
FROM FLOATING AWAY -- BUT WE

HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH A TSUNAMI

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:10.059

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.303
TO PUT ONE THING ON YOUR OF THE

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.771
THINGS YOU YOU NEED TO LOOK AT

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.541
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN EVEN IF IT'S

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.276
JUST A SMALL COLONY A SMALL

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:30.079
GROUP OF PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AT

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.814

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.465
HAVE UNIQUE SET OF OF CHALLENGES

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.134
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.571
WITH WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.473

DRUGS INTO THAT DOES DISASTER

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.183
ACTION ON CENTERS I REMEMBER

ARRESTS.

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.019
BEING THERE FOR SIX MONTHS.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.488
OR MORE -- BECAUSE THEY LOST THE

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.423
BUSINESSES AND HOMES AND SO UP.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.058
IN YOUR AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL

ALL MERGING MANAGEMENT AND I

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.006
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU --

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:06.742
WE'VE -- HAD A OUR FAIR SHARE OF

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:09.245
OF MUD SLIDES AND FIRES AND

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:12.848
EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER ISSUES OF

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.850
TAKE PLACE AND OFFICE OPEN WE

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:15.785
WOULD HAVE TO GO OVER THE RIGHT

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.453
WORD HERE ALREADY -- BUT WE'VE

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.187
WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.922
EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND OUR

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.491
PLAYBOOK AND BUT IT IS SOMETHING

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.626
THAT IS -- CHALLENGE FORCING WE

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:29.131
CONTINUE WORK REALLY CLOSELY

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:29.732
WITH THEM AND I WILL TAKE THAT

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.634
ARE.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.602
THE EFFORT ON CBS FACE

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:33.469
PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE FAIRS

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:34.971
AND I AM SURE THAT SOME OF OUR

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.472
SUBSEQUENT PANELS PROBABLY WOULD

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.139
HAVE BETTER INFORMATION TO SHARE

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:37.773
BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.341
DID DESCRIBE I THINK WE'RE

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.009
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IN A RECENT

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:40.243
EVENTS.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.910
WHERE WE HAD HOMELESS

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.645
POPULATIONS WHO SAW THE

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.280
AVAILABILITY THE SERVICES

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.315
UTILIZE THEM BUT THEN IT WAS A

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:47.583
CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S -- YOU

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:48.784
KNOW NOT.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.086
TRYING TO TRANSITION THEM BACK

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:52.054
INTO -- TRADITIONAL HOUSING

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:54.590
SITUATION BE THAT GOING TO A

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.292
HOTEL STAYING WITH RELATIVES.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.194
YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION ON THAT

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.328
FRONT DOESN'T CHANGE.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.730
AND SO I THINK FOR US WILL

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:02.999
CONTINUE -- TO BE OPENED

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.634
UNDERSTANDING THESE DYNAMICS

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.736
EXIST OUT THERE AND TO JUST BE --

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:08.471
WILLING AND ABLE PARTNER TO ALL

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:09.705
THE OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.774
THOSE SERVICES AND MAKE SURE

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.609
THAT IT OUR FACILITIES THAT WITH

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.378
THOSE SERVICES BECOME AVAILABLE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.345
AND THAT WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.548
DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:20.983
HAPPENS [inaudible]

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.019
THANK YOU.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:26.422
STREET IS MISSING.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.724
OKAY -- WHAT PREMIERES?

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:29.592
STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE -- I KNOW

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.394
THERE'S BEEN SOME LEGISLATION TO

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.161
ALLOW FOR BOTH.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.664
HOUSING THE HOMELESS AS WELL AS

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.299
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY COULD

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.700
POTENTIALLY DO ON FAIRGROUNDS

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.435
PROPERTY.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.270
IS THAT ARE THOSE VIABLE ISSUES

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:45.541
AND AND HOW HOW WOULD THE MIX

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.175
BECOME AT A TIME OF AN EMERGENCY

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:48.344
THAT -- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:50.546
QUESTION AND ACTUALLY -- I WAS

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.114
HAVING A DISCUSSION EARLIER

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.549
TODAY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.085
IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING ON

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.153
INFORMATION THAT'S BEING

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:58.387
DEVELOPED BY DEPARTMENT OF

01:05:58.454 --> 01:05:59.889
GENERAL SERVICES TO ASSESS ALL

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.290
THE STATE OWNED PROPERTIES OF

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:03.626
WHICH THE DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:04.226
ASSOCIATIONS ARE A SUBSET OF

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:04.727
THAT.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.961
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:07.463
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HOW

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.165
BEST TO WE ADDRESS.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:11.133
THAT BALANCE BETWEEN HAVING

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.635
PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.270
CAPACITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.338
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.772
HOMELESSNESS ISSUES.

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.908
BUT COUPLED UP TO THE FACT THAT

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:21.610
IF WE DO THAT ARE WE POSITIONING

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.312
OURSELVES TO NOT HAVE BEEN

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:25.381
INADEQUATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.248
SHOULD THAT OCCUR.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.917
SO YEAH I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:28.417
FOR YOU BUT I HAVE AN

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:29.819
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THAT IS

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.320
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT -- WE

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:32.455
ARE CONSIDERING AS WE WORK

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.190
THROUGH THIS EXERCISE OF

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:35.891
ASSESSING THOSE PROPERTIES AND

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:36.525
WHAT THE POTENTIAL IS FOR USING

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:38.427
THEM.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.096
AND OBVIOUSLY IF OF THE SHELTERS

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.664
ARE COMPLETELY OCCUPIED AND

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.399
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE A USABLE

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:44.567
LOCATION FOR SAID IT JUST

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.134
BECOMES A BURGER CHALLENGE

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.635
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A STAGING

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.371

OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE TO FIND A

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:53.843
DIFFERENT LOCATION FROM IT SO

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.479
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF A PRIOR

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.814
WHICH HIRES PRIORITY FOR THE A

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.649
LOCAL FOLKS ARE THERE OF USE OF

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:04.086

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.688
RESTROOMS ARE PICKING UP GARBAGE

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:26.589
IN THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT YOU

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:27.189
DO A FAIR.

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:30.526
BUT DURING EVACUATION.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.261
RED CROSS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ARE

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.063
BASICALLY ALTHOUGH IN TWO YEARS

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.464
AND THEY'RE TURNED OVER ON A

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.266
REGULAR BASIS SO THERE'S NOT A

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.068
LOT OF CONSISTENCY.

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:41.403
SO -- AT THE FAIR BECOMES REALLY

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.139
THE OVERSEER OF THE OPERATIONS --

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:45.441
WHICH IS INTERCALATED DISCS THE

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.142
SUCCESS OF WHAT HAPPENS FAIRS%

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:50.079
HOLD DOWN THE FORT UNTIL THE

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.448
CALVARY GETS THERE.

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:53.716
FAIRGROUNDS ARE NOW MAKE

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:54.450
EVACUATION SITES AND IT AND

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:57.920
INITIALLY -- IN.

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.021
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF THE THE

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.023
SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- YES THEY HAD

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.593
PLANNED ON SMALL CENTERS -- HIGH

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.495
SCHOOL GYMS AND CHURCHES AND

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.330
THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.898
REALIZED QUICKLY THAT IT WASN'T

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.567
BECOMING A MAKE EVACUATION AND

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.369
INITIALLY TOLD US NO WE'RE NOT

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.037
GONNA BRING PEOPLE OF FAIR

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:15.304
GROUNDS.

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:16.705
AND WITHOUT OVER A DAY WE HAD

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.506
TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE AND

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.142
UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT NOW --

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.810
THESE WILDFIRES IN THESE

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.445
EVACUATIONS ARE SO ROBUST THAT

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:27.182
WERE INSTANTLY EVACUATED WHICH

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:28.584
WE WERE IN.

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.218
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE'VE HAD

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:29.852
SOME CHALLENGES WITH RED CROSS

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:30.619
SHELTERS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.154
KNOW IT WAS KIND OF MENTIONED

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.756
PREVIOUSLY BUT THEY DON'T ALLOW

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:37.059
ANY ANIMALS -- AND IS STORY

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.527
CLIFF YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.828
HAPPENED A KATRINA -- WHILE THE

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.563
PEOPLE STAYED IN THEIR HOMES

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.197
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THEIR

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:43.499
ANIMALS.

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:46.502
SO IN DEL MAR AND ALSO -- IN

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.837
SONOMA WE ACTUALLY ACTIVATED TO

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:50.239
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHELTERS WE

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.107
HAD A RED CROSS SHELTER.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.175
THAT HAD PEOPLE WITHOUT A

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.943
ANIMALS AND WE HAD A SHELTER

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.011
THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME IN

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:57.646
WITH THEIR DOGS AND THEIR CATS

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:00.549
AND OF COURSE WE SEPARATED --

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:01.450
YOU KNOW HE ANY ANIMALS THERE

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:02.651
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS WE

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.187
KEPT AWAY AND WE HANDLED THAT.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.755
SO -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT RED

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:09.925
CROSS IS VERY STRICT ABOUT BUT

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.593
WE'VE ALWAYS FELT WERE OPENING

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.095
UP AND TAKING THESE PEOPLE AND

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.296
WE DON'T WANT EVAN CARS IN THE

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.531
PARKING LOT.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.965
WE DON'T WANT HIM INTENSE WE

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:18.801
WANT TO MAKE IN IN THE BUILDING

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.170
SO THEY CAN HAVE THE SERVICES --

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.137
FAIRS DO NEEDED NEW

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.605
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.240
SUPPORT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:26.975
TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT WAS

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.377
CUT FROM FAIRS.

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:32.214
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S MADE AN

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:33.515
IMPACT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:34.817
LOOK AT NEW NEW INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:35.284
TO HELP FAIRS -- AIR

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.352
CONDITIONING SYSTEMS RESTROOM

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:40.456
IMPROVEMENTS A ROBUST WIFI --

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.324
BROADBAND I'M ACTUALLY WORKING

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.927
WITH -- JOYS STERLING WHO'S ON

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:47.930
THE CDFA BOARD ON A FEW NO JOY --

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.598
TO GET BROADBAND OPENED UP AT

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:51.166
THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:53.068
AND THEN WORK ON OTHER

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.503
FAIRGROUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.873
SO -- MIGHT I KNOW THAT -- CDFA

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.608
IS WORKING ON THAT STRONGLY --

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:01.343
UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS -- MANY

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:04.012
FAIRS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THE

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:05.314
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT COME ON

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.883
SITES AND AND THE SEWER SYSTEM

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.852
IN THE WATER SYSTEMS --

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.887
FORTUNATELY FOR US AND I KNOW

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.555
UNTIL MORE THAN YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.491
NOT A PROBLEM THERE ARE SOME

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.058
FAIRS.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.526
PAVING OF DIRT PARKING LOTS LOTS

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:19.795
AFFAIRS HAVE DIRT PARKING LOTS

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:20.729
WE COULD YOU KNOW HELLO A SYSTEM

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.664
THAT ALLOWED FOR US SPENDING FOR

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.133
LIGHT TOWERS AND GENERATORS

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.135
WOULD BE GREAT -- SATELLITE

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:28.570
CONNECTIVITY SEVENTY ONESELF OUR

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:30.372
CELL TOWERS WERE BURNED IN THE

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.941
CINEMA AND NAPA FIRE IN.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:33.542
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO YOU

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.643
CAN IMAGINE THE IMPACT FROM THAT

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:38.147
AS WE ALL LIVE WITH OUR CELL

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:40.549
PHONES.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:41.750
EVACUATION SLIDE SUCH A SUPPLIES

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:42.551
WOULD BE GREAT ON THE

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.653
FAIRGROUNDS TO TO STAGE THOSE

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.388
CARDS COME FOR KIDS BLANKETS

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:49.358
PILLOWS -- WE ARE FORTUNATE IN

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:49.992
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RED CROSS

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.193
WAS ABLE TO BRING SOME OF THESE

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.095
ITEMS AND QUICKLY.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.496
UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD.

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.931
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:56.598
TO OPEN UP EVERYTHING THAT WAS

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:59.935
NEEDED AGAIN SOME ISSUES THERE --

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.570
ANIMALS FEEDING AND BETTING

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:02.838
WEEKLY RECORDED WITH A LOCAL

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:04.940
FEED STORE -- FOR FUNDING AND

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.108
WHEN PEOPLE CALLING ABOUT

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.810
DONATIONS WE HAD TO THE FUNDING

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.511
GO THERE -- BUT IT WOULD BE

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.079
GREAT TO HAVE SOME FUNDING

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:11.780
THROUGH THE STATE THAT'S

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:14.082
EARMARKED TO GET THIS MONEY SO

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.384
THAT THESE FAIRS CAN ACTUALLY

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:17.252
BUY THESE THESE ITEMS.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:18.086
BUCKETS HOSES RAKES WHEEL

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.122
BARRELS VETERINARY SUPPLIES ALL

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.556
OF THOSE ARE REALLY

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.057
INTERCULTURAL -- TO THE

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.493
OPERATION -- SO FUNDING THAT

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.727
BECAUSE IT MECHANISM THROUGH THE

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.629
STATE -- TO ALLOW FAIRS TO

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.397
PURCHASE.

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.499
THESE ITEMS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:33.101
A VERY KEY -- ADDITION TO HELP

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.970
FAIRS EFFECTIVELY WORK ON THE

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.205
EVACUATIONS.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:37.172
AND THEN ABILITY TO GET

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.207
REIMBURSED QUICKLY FOR

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:42.744
EVACUATION SUPPLIES THAT THEY

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:43.712
DID HAVE TO SPEND.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:44.479
WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.814
ABOUT FEMA -- WE WERE I THINK

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:47.015
THE FIRST FAIRS IN THE STATE TO

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:49.751
BRING AND FEMA TRAILERS AFTER

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.385
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD A

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:53.188
HUNDRED AND TWENTY OUR HAD NO

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.556
EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH HIM IN

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:57.726
THAT REGARD HOWEVER -- THROUGH

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.494
THIS A FOUND OUT TO THERE'S LOTS

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.163
OF CHALLENGES WHEN FEMA.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.298
GETS INDIVIDUALS INTO THOSE

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.166
TRAILERS.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.667
THEY CAN REPLICATE THEIR RIGHTS

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.369
BUT IF THE IF THE PERSON DOESN'T

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:08.503
LEAVE THEY HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.239
ARM A GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.773
JUSTICE WHICH IS A GIGANTIC BIG

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.877
BLACK HOLE -- AND WE ARE NOW I'M

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.145
ACTUALLY GOING TO COURT TOMORROW

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.413
TO TRAIN INVICTA FEMA --

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.215
INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS REPLICATED

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:21.683
MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.818
WHO JUST WON'T LEAVE.

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.553
SO THAT BECOMES A COST AND

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.188
EXPENSE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS AND

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:29.024
FEMA HAS REALLY NO ABILITY TO DO

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.927
MUCH ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T DO

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:33.996
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:36.198
ON AB THAT GOES INTO THAT -- AND

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:37.165
I HAD A COMMENT OR A

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.166
CONVERSATION WITH -- THEIR

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.434
TOURNEY ASKING THEM WHY THEY

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.168
DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEY SAID

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.503
IT'S BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.905
THE PRIVACY AND THE RIGHTS OF

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:43.939
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.007
THERE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.842
PROTECTING THE BAD PEOPLE AS

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.611
WELL -- WE'VE HAD DRUG DRUG

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:53.148
DEALERS OVERDOSES PROSTITUTION --

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.918
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.320
HOMELESS -- IT WAS SURPRISING TO

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.855
ME THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.390
KNOW FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOT

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.524
FAMILY BUT FRIENDS THAT LOST

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.026
THEIR HOME IN THE FIRES.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.094
THAT WENT DOWN TO APPLY FOR FEMA

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.497
UPS A SUPPORT AND WHEN THEY GOT

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:09.131
DOWN THERE SOMEBODY ELSE AT ALL

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.300
WE'RE ALREADY APPLIED FOR THEIR

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.134
HOME.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.870
SO LOTS OF FRAUD HAPPENING AND

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.339
THE VETTING SYSTEM IS IS NEEDS

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.274
WORKS -- LOTS OF STORIES WITH

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:23.045
THAT -- SORT OF IN CLOSING

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.179
ACCOUNT WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.480
AYE OUR PREVIOUS -- SPEAKERS

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:26.581
TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FARES

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:27.916
HELLO YES I THINK THERE REALLY

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:28.784
NEEDS TO BE.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:31.386
A BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN --

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:33.288
YES AND FAIRS AND MAYBE THERE'S

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.057
A LADY I GUESS ON POSITION AT

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.592
CDFA THAT COULD HELP WITH THAT.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:41.596
I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY BE --

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:43.065
IMPORTANT BECAUSE DURING THOSE

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.533
EVACUATIONS THEY COME IN ALL OF

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.976
COORDINATION AND LIAISON WITH

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.210
THAT THAT WE WORKED IN ADVANCE

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.179
OF THAT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.013
BIG DIFFERENCE.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.182

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.363
COMPONENTS BECAUSE FORMALLY I

WAS THE CEO AT THE NAPA COUNTY

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:17.332
FAIRGROUNDS WHICH IS IN

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.467
CALISTOGA.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:19.835
I WE GET REFERRED TO AS NAPA

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:22.237
OFTEN -- BECAUSE THIS DISORDER

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.705
THAT WAY -- BUT IT'S REALLY THE

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:24.573
THE SMALLER FAIRGROUNDS UP IN

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:27.442
CALISTOGA -- BEFORE I REALLY

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.378
SPEAK ON MY POINTS I JUST WANT

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:30.946
TO KIND OF REITERATE BUT BACK HE

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.481
WAS STATING ABOUT WHAT HOW

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.216
INTEGRATED WE ARE I THINK THAT'S

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:34.850
PART OF WHAT REALLY GOES ON THE

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.618
SONG ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY IS HOW

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.186
INTEGRATED WE ARE WITH ONE

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:38.587
ANOTHER.

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:39.921
IN OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION IN

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.224
CALISTOGA IN TWO THOUSAND

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.791
FIFTEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:43.859
VALLEY FIRES THE FIRST PHONE

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.160
CALL THAT I RECEIVED WAS

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.628
ACTUALLY FROM BACKING AND HER

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:47.829
TEAM IN SAN DIEGO.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.032
SAYS AND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:50.732
DO YOU NEED.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.200
DO YOU NEED PEOPLE DO YOU NEED

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.835
RESOURCES DO YOU NEED MONEY DO

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.737
YOU NEED EQUIPMENT AND THEY WERE

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:56.772
ON A PLANE.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.607
I THINK THAT SAME DAY MAYBE

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.609
THAT'S LATE IS THE NEXT MORNING --

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:01.877
TO COME IN TO HELP AND SO PART

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:04.513
OF IT IS THIS NETWORK THAT WE

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.547
HAVE IS AN INDUSTRY.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:06.948
ALONG WITH OUR OTHER INDUSTRY

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:09.217
PARTNERS WHICH IS REALLY HOW WE

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:12.554
WERE SUCCESSFUL -- IN CALISTOGA.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:15.357
SO -- I ALSO IN THOSE TWO

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:18.126
CAPACITIES REPRESENT TWO OF THE

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.262
COMPONENTS -- THERE'S ONE SMALL

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.530
IN THE CITRUS FAIRS OF THE

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.098
INDUSTRY AND THAT IS --

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.533
CALISTOGA IS A COUNTY OWNED

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.101
FACILITY NAPA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.104
IS -- SO IT'S A LOCALLY OWNED

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.605
WHEREAS THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.240
IS IT JUST IS THE TWENTY SECOND

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.775
DISTRICT ASSOCIATION.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.445
AND BUT BOTH OF THOSE ALL OF THE

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.979
FACILITIES REALLY WERE KIND OF

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.781
FOUNDED AROUND THE THIRTIES --

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.283
AND WITH THEIR IF THE FACILITIES

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.185
BUILT OUT THROUGHOUT THE FIFTIES

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.886
AND SIXTIES HERE WE ARE IN TWO

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:45.921
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND WE

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.190
STILL HAVE MANY OF THOSE SAME.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.991
BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES AND

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.461
THINGS LIKE THAT -- AND THAT WAS

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:53.028
REALLY DONE THROUGH COURSE

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.663
RAISING FUNDING SO PART OF WHAT

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.164
I ALSO WANT TO JUST IMPRESS UPON

01:18:56.231 --> 01:19:03.071
YOU IS THE REALLY.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.206
OUR APPROACH AS AN INDUSTRY HAS

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:04.873
ALWAYS BEEN WEARING INDUSTRY WE

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.740
ARE THE CALIFORNIA NETWORK OF

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:06.608
FAIR GROUNDS IT REGARDLESS OF

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.510
WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.811
AND WHO OWNS THIS AND THOSE

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.346
RULES ARE ASIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.615
E'RE UTILIZED IN THE CASE OF

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.784
EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- FOR KIND

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:16.918
OF FOLLOWING UP ON SOME OF THE

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.621
COMMENTS THAT -- KEVIN MASSA HER

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.456
AND MITCH.

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.724
MEDIC OF THAT I HOPE I

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.092
PRONOUNCED THAT CLOSE -- JUST TO

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:24.960
THANK THEM FOR THEIR ONGOING

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.962
SUPPORT -- BUT ALSO I WANTED TO

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.063
GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.231
BACKGROUND OR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.399
OF FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.368
FAIRGROUNDS -- THROUGH

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.804
THROUGHOUT THE FUNDING FOR FAIR

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:36.271
GROUNDS.

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.639
ESPECIALLY IN MORE RECENT

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.808
DECADES EVEN THE LARGER FAIR

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:45.313
GROUNDS -- THE DELL MARS -- THE

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.982
AND ORANGE COUNTY IS AND SO ON

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.650
RECEIVE A SMALLER PORTION OF THE

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.385
FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.154
TO THE INDUSTRY LARGER PORTION

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.054
GOING TO THE SMALLER FAIRS ARE

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.689
MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:55.457
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.692
AND PART OF THE IDEA BEHIND THAT

01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:58.894
IS THAT AS HE'S LARGER

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.662
FAIRGROUNDS THERE'S MORE

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:01.930
OPPORTUNITY TO IN ESSENCE

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.933
GENERATE THE FUNDING NECESSARY

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.635
TO PUT BACK INTO THE FACILITIES.

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:09.037
BUT AS TIMES HAVE CHANGED -- AND

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.239
REGULATIONS OF CHANGE AND THINGS

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.340
LIKE THAT EVEN THAT IS GETTING

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.508
CHALLENGING FOR SOME OF OUR

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.676
LARGER FACILITIES.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.578
AS JUST AS AN EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.513
IN DEL MAR AND WE HAVE A FIFTEEN

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.981
MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT -- THAT

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:23.451
WERE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THAT.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.252
FOR LACK OF GETTING TO

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.654
SCIENTIFIC IS BUILDING AN

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.322
ULTRAVIOLET AND BIO FILTRATION

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.324
SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN PROCESS

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.792
OUR STORM WATER.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.928
NOT JUST CHARGE IT -- INTO THE

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.362
RIVERS ARE THE OCEANS ANYMORE

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.031
AND THAT SO WE CAN STAY IN THE

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:42.137
BUSINESS OF HORSE RACING HORSE

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:43.538
SHOWS AND LIVESTOCK SHOWS.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:44.472
THAT THERE'S NOT REALLY REVENUE

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.374
GENERATOR FOR FOR STORM WATER AS

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:47.509
AS YOU WELL KNOW SO.

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:48.476
AND THEN FOR THE SMALLER

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.178
FAIRGROUNDS -- FROM KIND OF THE

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:52.948
MID NINETEEN NINETIES TO TWO

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:53.748
THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY RECEIVED ON

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.383
AVERAGE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.251
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR CAPITAL

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:57.018
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.621
SO YOU REALLY HAVE THIS THIRTY

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.689
FORTY FIFTY YEAR GAP OF THAT

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.724
TYPE OF FUNDING AND THEN I'M

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.725
SURE AS YOU KNOW A HUNDRED

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:04.726
THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES NOT GO A

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.861
LONG WAY WHEN IT COMES TO SEWER

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:07.662
SYSTEMS.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.598
RUSLAN BUILDINGS HVAC SYSTEMS

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:13.568
AND SO ON BUT IT WAS LEAST WAS

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:14.769
BETTER THAN NOTHING.

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:15.537
AND THEN WE HAVE A PERIOD OF A

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:16.338
FEW YEARS WITH NOTHING AND SO

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:17.305
THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:20.408
RECEIVED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS --

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.409
FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WITH

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.211
THE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED VERY

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.347
MUCH NEEDED BUT IT'S REALLY JUST

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.983
THE TIP OF THE TIP OF THE

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.684
ICEBERG FOR US.

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:32.087
SO -- AND UNLIKE FIRE CAMP

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:33.855
OPERATIONS IT WAS ALLUDED TO

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.423
EARLIER THAT AS FAIR GROUNDS WE

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:37.025
RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR THE USE OF

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.526
OUR FACILITIES IN THESE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.028
EMERGENCIES NOT ENTIRELY.

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.896
YES IN A FIRE CAMP OPERATION AND

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:43.598
THAT'S WERE -- YES AND CAL FIRE

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.200
DO YOU PAY RENTAL FEE FOR THAT

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:46.334
MORE AND MORE ARE FAIR GROUNDS

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.270
ARE UTILIZES EVACUATION CENTERS

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.571
AND WHAT WE GET IS A

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.040
REIMBURSEMENT OF ACTUALLY GUNS

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.174
EXPENSES INCURRED.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.577
WHAT WE DON'T GET IS ANY KIND OF

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:57.979
MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF REVENUE

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.781
THAT THE FAIRGROUNDS ITSELF

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.049
WHICH IS HAVE TO BE SELF

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.018
GENERATING TO SUPPORT AND PAY

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:05.487
FOR ITS EMPLOYEES IT'S UTILITIES --

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:09.557
ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BE

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:11.092
THERE FOR COMMUNITY.

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:14.696
THAT'S JUST THAT'S A LOSS FOR US --

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.831
OF THE BACKYARD HE SPOKE TO DEL

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:17.932
MAR'S ROLE IN -- WHICH LED TO

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.134
THEIR ABILITY TO HELP US OUT SO

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:19.634
MUCH IN CALISTOGA SO IN

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.903
CALISTOGA IN TWO THOUSAND

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:22.437
FIFTEEN A LITTLE SLEEPY

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:23.705
CALISTOGA UP NORTH.

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.173
THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE THAT

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.609
BROKE OUT IN NAPA COUNTY WAS THE

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:28.576
BUT CANYON FIRE.

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.912
AND SO WE WERE ACTUALLY

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.380
ACTIVATED OUR FAIRGROUNDS IS

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:35.150
ACTIVATED FOR NAPA COUNTY

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:36.117
RESIDENTS.

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:37.052
WELL WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.853
VALLEY FIRE HAD BROKEN THAT SAME

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.689
DAY ACTUALLY JUST A FEW HOURS

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:43.625
EARLIER AND SO WHEN THE SOCIAL

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.660
MEDIA WENT OUT THE EVACUATION

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:47.562
CENTER OPENING CALISTOGA THOSE

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.231
RESIDENTS UP ON UP ON THE

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:50.832

COUNTY.

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.268
I MEAN IT WAS TWO LANES ON A TWO

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.869
LANE HIGHWAY I'M COMING INTO

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:57.672
CALISTOGA AND SO WE WENT FROM A

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:59.174
POPULATION OF FIVE THOUSAND IN

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.408
OUR TOWN TO A POPULATION OF

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.444
ABOUT -- SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.778
PRACTICALLY OVER NIGHT AND WAS

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.380
REALLY ONE OF THE MORE RECENT

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:10.285
FORAYS INTO THIS MASSIVE INFLUX --

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:12.487
AN EVACUATION CENTER --

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:13.888
INITIALLY THERE WERE SOME

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.623
CHALLENGES BECAUSE WHAT WAS

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.559
BEING REPORTED AS A RED CROSS

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:18.827
WAS ON SCENE BUT WHAT WAS BEING

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.862
REPORTED OUT WAS THAT WE HAD

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.330
TWENTY THREE PEOPLE.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.798
IN THE EVACUATION CENTER.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.400
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.868
TWENTY THREE PEOPLE INSIDE.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.137
BECAUSE THE OTHER FIFTEEN

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.271
HUNDRED PEOPLE HAD CHOSEN TO

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:34.409
STAY OUTSIDE IN TENTS IN CARS --

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.543
BECAUSE TO STAY WITH THEIR

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.945
ANIMALS TO STAY WITH THEIR

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:39.180
ENTIRE FAMILY TO STAY IN ESSENCE

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:40.715
WITH THEIR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:41.983
SO IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DELAYED

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.318
IN GETTING SOME OF THE THE

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.920
RESOURCES IN SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.857
THAT -- THAT PROCESS THAT EXISTS

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:54.362
WITH -- WITHIN RED CROSS.

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:54.963
DID YOU HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.331
SHELTER FOOD HOW MANY BEDS WERE

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.333
AVAILABLE IN THE SHELL -- THERE

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.634
WILL HELP FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.301
TWENTY THREE WERE BEING ASKED TO

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:00.969
LEAVE THEY WERE BEING TOLD THAT

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:02.137
THEY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR PETS AND

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:03.371
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.672
PERSONALLY HAVE NOT BEEN THROUGH

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.641
THE HAVING TO FLEE MY HOME WITH

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.009
THE CLOTHES ON MY BACK.

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:09.411
AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:12.447
THINGS IN MY LIFE OF MY PETS AND

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.215
MY CHILDREN.

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.250

THINGS YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF YOU

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.992
HAVE A HOME LEFT.

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:26.294
IF ALL THIS FAMILY PHOTOS YOUR

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:26.928
HEIRLOOMS.

CLOSER TO AT WHATEVER YOU HAVE

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.564
THE MEMORIES IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:31.032
BE THERE OR NOT AND WE JUST

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.634
IMAGINE THAT WAS VERY

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:33.468
DEVASTATING SO AS THE FAIR

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.603
GROUNDS WE STEPPED INTO THAT

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:36.337
ROLE.

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.973
AND WE SERVED THREE THOUSAND HOT

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.942
MEALS A DAY OUR COMMUNITY MADE

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.143
INTERNATIONAL NEWS FOR THE

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.946
HOSPITALITY THAT WE SHOW TO

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:45.680
THESE TO IN ESSENCE THESE

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:46.481
NEIGHBORING FOLKS NOT EVEN OUR

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:48.483
OWN COMMUNITY TECHNICALLY.

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:49.884
IF PEOPLE WANTED TO GET INTO

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.486
BOUNDARIES WE DIDN'T KNOW

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:52.854
WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE EVEN

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.355
GOING TO BE REIMBURSED ARE

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.623
COUNTY EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.392
WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF THE AMMO

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:58.193
USE AND THINGS THAT

01:24:58.259 --> 01:24:59.561
UNFORTUNATELY WEREN'T IN PLACE

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.929
QUITE YET.

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:01.429
SO IT'S REALLY QUITE THE

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:03.298
UNDERTAKING AND WE WEREN'T

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:04.866
SERVING BOLOGNA SANDWICHES AND

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:05.667
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:10.905
SANDWICHES WE WERE SIR I CAN

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:12.173
ATTEST TO THAT.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.441
I MEAN IT WAS REALLY JUST AND I

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:14.476
THINK IT'S KIND OF RAISE THE

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:15.109
AWARENESS OF JUST HOW MUCH WE

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:15.810
CAN REALLY HELP TAKE CARE OF OUR

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.913
COMMUNITIES IN THESE TIMES OF

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.848
NEED IT WAS JUST IT WAS VERY

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.049
EXPOUNDING THING THE AMOUNT OF

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:21.683
COMMITTEE SUPPORT THAT YOU SEE

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:22.150
COMING OUT.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.418
AND COOKING AND HELPING AND AND

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.019
IT IS AN IMPERFECT BECAUSE OF

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.387
THIS ROLE WE PLAY WITHIN OUR

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.122
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A TRUST WITH

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.191
THEM WE CELEBRATE THEM ALL THE

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:31.826
TIME WHETHER IT'S AT OUR FAIRS

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:33.728
OR THE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:34.996
TAKE PLACE ON OUR GROUNDS THE

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:36.965
KING THING YEAR AS THE WEDDINGS.

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.500
THE FUND RAISERS SO THERE'S

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:39.501
ALREADY THIS RELATIONSHIP AND

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.369
OUR COMMUNITY CAME OUT OF THE

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.571
WOODWORKS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:46.007
COMING IN WITH A BAD.

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.510
WITH YOU TENSE AGAIN FOOD A CALL

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.377
WENT OUT THAT WE NEEDED

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:50.678
BATTERIES NEXT THING YOU KNOW A

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:55.149
DURACELL TRUCK SHOWS THAT DIDN'T

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:57.218
KNOW THEY HAD.

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.187
ONE SEMIS PULLING IN WITH THAT

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.688
AND THEN NOT THAT ROLE WE PLAY

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.090
IS FAIR GROUNDS WHERE WERE USED

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:03.091
TO MANAGING EVENTS WERE USED TO

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.125
MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:04.692
THROUGHOUT THOSE MAKING SURE

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:05.326
FIRE LANES STAY OPEN AND THINGS

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.227
LIKE THAT.

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.695
AND SO GETTING THINGS PLACED IN

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:09.764
SUCH A WAY THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.599
THAT SPACE FOR ALL PARTIES IF

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.701
CAL FIRE HAD NEEDED TO COME IN

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.770
WITH A A FIRE CAMP OPERATION WE

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.171
HAD SPACE SET ASIDE FOR THEM.

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:19.974
THE SHELTER OPERATION WE WE WERE --

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.309
WE OPEN AS AN EVACUATION CENTER

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.078
AND THEN WE RAN AS A SHELTER FOR

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:24.646
FOURTEEN DAYS.

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.281
AND IT'S NOT TOLL ON OUR

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:29.150
FACILITIES THAT'S REALLY THAT

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.152
THE CRUX OF OF WHAT I'M HERE TO

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.086
TALK ABOUT.

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.087
BECAUSE OUR FACILITIES WEREN'T

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.255
BUILT FOR THAT YES THEY'RE BUILT

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.424
FOR INFLUXES OF LARGE PEOPLE BUT

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:39.027
NOT SUSTAINING THEM NECESSARILY.

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:41.095
AND SO AGAIN THREE ABOUT A

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.263
THOUSAND THREE TIMES A DAY ABOUT

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.299
A THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR A HOT WELL

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.066
COOKED MEAL.

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:50.939
WELL OVER THE COURSE OF THAT OUR

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.740
KITCHEN SEWER SYSTEM FAILED.

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:53.975
IT'S UNDERNEATH A CEMENT FLOOR

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.209
IT CAN'T BE REPAIRED IN THE

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:57.011
MIDST OF THIS SO TEMPORARY FIX

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:57.879
WAS PUT IN PLACE FOR IT. FOUR

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:58.880
YEARS LATER THAT TEMPORARY FIX

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:00.448
IS STILL THERE BECAUSE WHAT IT

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.716
WILL REQUIRE IS.

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:02.717
POTENTIALLY TEARING DOWN THE

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.586
BUILDING BUT AT LEAST TEARING UP

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.688
THE FLOOR TO GET TO THAT FIX AND

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.755
YET THAT'S A BUILDING THAT OUR

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.791
COMMUNITY ALSO RELIES ON FOR

01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:12.627
THEIR EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES AS

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:17.265
WELL -- WE HAD -- WE HAD ISSUES

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:20.835
OF OUR SWAMP COOLERS WERE --

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.971
TURNED ON WITHOUT WATER.

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.272
SO THEY BURNT UP IT WAS ABOUT A

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.340
HUNDRED FORTUNATELY OUR COUNTY

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:27.809
DID PUT IN AN INSURANCE CLAIM

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.477
FOR US TO REPLACE THOSE BUT THAT

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.346
WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:32.614
DOLLAR PROJECT TO REPLACE THAT.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.815
SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY AND A

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:34.682
LOT OF OUR FACILITIES DON'T

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:35.717
NECESSARILY HAVE THE PROPER

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.852
VENTILATION HEATING AND AIR

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.354
CONDITIONING IN THE COURSE OF

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.788
THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS WE WENT FROM

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.957
EXTREME HEAT TO POURING FREEZING

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:43.825
RAIN.

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:46.027
AND PEOPLE INTENSE AND IN CARS

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.128
OUTSIDE AND TRYING TO COME UP

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:50.064
WITH -- FACILITIES TO PUT THEM

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.833
IN -- SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:52.734
CHALLENGES WERE THINGS LIKE

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.602
PROPERLY FUNCTIONING GATES AND

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.204
PERIMETER FENCE LINES AND THINGS

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.672
AND AND A LOT OF FAIR GROUNDS

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.240
HAVE THIS BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:00.575
BEEN ONLY SO MUCH MONEY YOU'VE

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:02.110
GOT A SELF GENERATED TO MAKE

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:02.944
IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUR SEWER

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.512
SYSTEMS FAILING OVER HERE SO

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:04.946
MAYBE.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.147
YOU DON'T GET OVER THERE TO

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.949
REPLACE THAT GATE BUT BEING ABLE

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.484
TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.452
PROTECTION AND SECURITY FOR

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:13.721
EVACUEES BECAUSE YOU ALSO DO YOU

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:17.859
WIND UP WITH A MIGRANT --

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:20.328
REVELERS. TO FIND OUT -- THERE'S

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:23.398
MEALS THERE'S CLOTHING ITEMS AND

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:23.965
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE LITTLE

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:26.768
OPPORTUNISTIC AND SO YOU KNOW WE

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:28.336
WOUND UP WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:31.406
OF HOMELESS POPULATION OR ARE

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.640
COUNTY SHERIFF'S ARE SAYING.

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:33.941
THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THE

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.843
FIRES WERE FAMILIAR WITH THEM IN

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.779
IN OTHER AREAS OF OUR OF OUR

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:40.148
COMMUNITY -- YOU ARE RESTROOMS

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:41.349
IN OUR SHOWERS THAT WE HAVE ON

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.884
HAND AND WHILE IT'S GREAT THAT

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.619
THE CALVARY IS COMING IN THESE

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.621
OTHER RESOURCES WERE DEPLOYED

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:47.588
SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE IS

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.023
FAIR GROUNDS A GO BACK TO THAT

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.191
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:52.160
NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW POWER

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:53.661
DEMANDS ON SOME OF THOSE AND

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.930
WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:58.466
PLUG AND PLAY THAT SYSTEM IN.

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.568
THE NEED FOR WIFI FOR JUST ABOUT

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.403
EVERYTHING TO OPERATE INCLUDING

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:30.491
AND PUT A MODEL ONE PLACE

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.493
BECAUSE WHAT WE ALL LEARNED

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.360
ABOUT LATER WAS THE DRUG

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:34.361
TRAFFICKING IN ALL THE OTHER

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:36.063
THINGS THAT WENT WITH THAT WERE

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.698
REALLY RAMPANT AND WE NEED.

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.166
TO PUT IN A BOX AND CAN BE A

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:42.436
WATCH OF WE ULTIMATELY HAD --

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:43.637
AND HOW YOU IDENTIFY PEOPLE

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:44.772
LATEST SELF IDENTIFIED IF YOU

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:46.440
WILL SO PEOPLE SO THIS

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.308
INTERESTING THING ABOUT RED

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:49.143
CROSS -- THEY DON'T ACTUALLY OWN

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:50.411
THE PEOPLE THERE OUTSIDE THE

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.012
GIVE THEM SERVICES BUT THEY

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.647
DON'T MANAGE THEM.

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:57.351
SO WHICH WAS AN APPARENT FOR A

01:35:57.418 --> 01:36:02.356
DAY AND A HALF PROBABLY -- AND

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:03.157
SO THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:03.757
LIVING OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:04.358
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN AVAILING

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.026
THEMSELVES OF SERVICES THEY WERE

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.962
JUST THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:09.897
HOMELESS AND TAKE.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.066
THAT THEY COULD GET SOME BENEFIT

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:12.666
OUT OF IT TEHAMA A LOT OF AND

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.535
GET FREE TENTS AND BLANKETS AND

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:15.569
THAT SORT OF THING.

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:18.439
OF THERE WAS A LOT OF FREE FOOD --

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.507
BROUGHT IN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:21.709
AND THEY WERE LIVING LARGE FOR

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:25.346
FOR AWHILE -- THERE WERE -- OVER

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:26.914
FIFTY STAFF BETWEEN RED CROSS

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:29.216
AND SECURITY HOUSE ON THE GROUND

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.218
IN OUR BUILDINGS -- NO IDEA HOW

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.920
MANY VOLUNTEERS BUT HUNDREDS AND

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:35.322
HUNDREDS -- PROBABLY A COUPLE

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:36.924
HUNDRED ON BOTH SIDES EACH ARE

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:38.626
OVER THE PERIOD THE HUMAN

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.361
CHARTER LASTED THIRTY DAYS AND

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:42.196
BASICALLY -- BECAUSE OF SOME

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:45.466
COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES --

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:46.100
PARTICULARLY WITH HIGH SCHOOL IN

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:48.569
THE GYM -- IT BECAME APPARENT TO

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.204
THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF THE

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:51.672
THAT PART OF THE SHELTER WAS

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.007
RELOCATED TO SILVER DOLLAR.

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.909
AND SO IT IT MOVED THERE AT THAT

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:57.244
TIME -- WHAT WHERE WE RETAIN A

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.979
LARGE ANIMALS FOR A LONG TIME

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.314
AFTER THAT WAS ACTUALLY HANDLED

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:01.782
AT A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL WITH RED

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:05.719
CROSS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT? FOR

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:09.123
ROASTED -- AT THE PEAK OF USE ON

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.224
A PERCENT OF HER GROUNDS

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:11.158
FACILITIES WERE USED -- CARLENE

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.326
GAVE A SPEECH A FEW YEARS AGO

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:12.927
AND SHE SAID IF YOU EVER GET A

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.228
DISASTER MAKE SURE ON THE GROUND.

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.996
AND SO I TREATED LIKE I'M

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.965
RUNNING AT ALL AND AT THE END WE

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.500
HAD GIVEN IT ALL UP IT WAS.

01:37:19.567 --> 01:37:22.503
QUITE AMAZING -- THIRD AT ALL

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.705
HOW MANY ACRES YOU FOR ONCE --

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.808
JUST UNDER -- FORTY THERE WERE

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:28.475
SOME REALLY AMAZING THINGS COME

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:29.143
OUT OF WITH ALLUDED TO IT BEFORE

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.744
BUT THIS NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.346
FAIRS THAT WERE IN AND AND THE

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:33.914
COMMUNITIES THAT WE EACH HAVE

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.349
AROUND IT AND AND EACH ONE OF US

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.117
REPRESENTS COMMUNITY IN.

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:37.685
TOGETHER THAT'S A VERY LARGE

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:40.454
COMMUNITY -- TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.456
OUT REACH -- BOTH CDFA AND SEE

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.358
IF AS A SENSE STAFF DOWN IN THE

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:45.559
FIRST WEEK TO JUST HELP WITH THE

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:47.228
CRAZINESS OF ADMINISTRATING.

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:49.430
SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- AND WE

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:50.664
HAD THREE DIFFERENT FAIRGROUNDS

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:51.632
BRING DOWN SEND ON THEIR

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.601
FACILITY CREWS -- AT VARIOUS

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:55.402
TIMES STILL KIND OF BAYLOR OWN

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.071
LITTLE TRUE OUT FROM.

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:58.906
BEING GROUNDING IN IN THE NEW OR

01:37:58.973 --> 01:37:59.940
WHATEVER ELSE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:01.242
FROWNING AT THE TIME.

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.810
UC DAVIS AS I MENTIONED IT'S

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:04.345
BEEN A LOT OF HELLO TREMENDOUS

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:05.145
MY RESOURCES UP THERE THEY'VE

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:06.447
ALSO DONE QUITE A BIT OF STUDY

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.948
WORK ON THAT.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:08.515
PARTICULAR PROJECT IN SHOULD

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:11.819
HELP WITH FUTURE DISASTERS --

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:16.824
EVERY SERVICE CLUB EVERY.

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.791
CHURCH GROUP EVER READ THE CITY

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:18.259
SERVICES.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:19.393
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EVERYBODY

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.296
POURED OUT -- FROM DURHAM OR A

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:25.633
BILL -- BIG SCREEN LADY.

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:26.533
DOWN IN A LIVE OAK IT WAS A

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.269
LITTLE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:31.572
THAT CAME FORWARD -- IN AND IN A

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:32.139
LITTLE THE ONE LAST LITTLE

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:33.674
AMAZING SIGHT POINT FORGET SOME

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:35.976
OF THE NEGATIVE STUFF -- WE HAD

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:37.011
GOTTEN A GRANT.

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.013
THROUGH THIS IS -- FAIR FUNDING

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.547
TO UPGRADE TO MORE WIRE --

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:43.817
LEXICAL SERVICES AND WE REPLACED

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:46.520
FIVE PANELS. FOR TRANSFORMERS IN

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.988
TWO OF THE LARGE SERVICE PANELS

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:49.123
I'M AND THAT WORK IT WAS

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:50.891
COMPLETED ON THE DAY WE OPENED A

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.192
SHELTER.

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:52.960
KIND OF LIKE THERE'S THERE'S

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.395
SOME BEING CONTROLLING THESE

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:55.829
THINGS AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:56.930
ESSENTIAL WE WOULD NOT HAVE

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.365
ENABLE HANDLE WITH FEDERAL.

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:00.200
FORTIES AND FIFTIES POWER PANELS

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:02.703
AND AND HOME TRANSFORMERS --

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.273
SIGNIFICANT BURDENS -- PROBABLY

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:07.574
THE BIGGEST ONE THAT WE'RE STILL

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.710
LIVING WITH IS THE DAMAGE THAT

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.578
IS CAUSED BY -- OPERATING THE

01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.981
SHELTERS AND RETAIN -- OLIVER

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.549
DIRT ROADS AND SOME OF OUR

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:18.252
ASPHALT ROADS SOME RAFFLE ROSE

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.987
RETURN IN THE DIRT AND ARE DIRT

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.322
ROADS ARE TURNING THE BIG HOLES --

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:23.057
THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS WEEK WE

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:23.924
STARTED REBUILDING THIS ROUTE SO

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.559
IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR THE

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.428
FUNDING TO COME BUT THEY WILL BE

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:29.630
BETTER THAN THEY EVER WERE SO

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:30.998
THAT THAT'S A THAT'S THE GOOD

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:33.500
NEWS -- FUNDS FOR SOME OF THESE

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:35.235
REPAIRS ARE REALLY SLOW AND AND

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:38.205
AND NOT KNOCKING A PROCESS BUT

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:40.374
AS A SMALL NONPROFIT WE CAN'T DO

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.275
ANYTHING ON SOMEBODY GIVES US

01:39:41.342 --> 01:39:44.611
THE MONEY SO.

01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:45.212
THERE WILL BE SOME THINGS THAT

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:46.213
MAY.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.147
WAIT FOR A QUITE AWHILE TILL

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:47.948
SOME OF THIS FUNDING COMES IN

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.683
AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO THAT --

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.618
I MENTIONED THE SEVERE DRUG

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.454
ABUSE SITUATION WE HAD IT DID

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.689
NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING --

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.124
ACTUALLY SOME OF THE VERY FIRST

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:58.792
PERSONS THAT WERE IN THERE THE

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.227
TENSE ARRIVE BEFORE THE ARMIES

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.563
AND THEY MOSTLY ALL PROBABLY

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.631
FELL INTO THAT CATEGORY.

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:07.034
ONCE WE FIGURED IT OUT -- IN

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.869
THIS WAS THEY WERE TALKING CAM

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.704
FINDING SYRINGES AT EIGHT THEY

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.272
IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IN SHOWERS

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:13.774
AND RESTROOMS AND THAT SORT OF A

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.209
INTO IN THEIR PORTABLE ONCE

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:17.478
FEMUR RED CROSS -- YEAH I WAS IT

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:18.746
WAS CALLOW YES THAT RESPONDED

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:19.980
THAT I BELIEVE FOR THE MOST PART

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:20.881
AND COUNTY.

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:23.317
AND WITHIN TWO DAYS THEY HAD TO

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:24.585
DO THE FIRST DUMP RUNS TO THE

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:26.019
SANITATION DEPARTMNT WITH THE

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:28.088
WATER AND IMMEDIATELY IT WAS ALL

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:29.390
TREATED AS BIO PLACED.

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:31.725
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND THAT

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:32.860
WAS AN EYE OPENER THE WHOLE TOWN

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:35.829
AND REALLY WE JUST DON'T SEE

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:38.365
THAT SORT OF THING AND SO WE WE

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:40.467
GOT OUR EYES OPEN THAT DAY --

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.836
VERY LONG HOURS FOR A VERY SMALL

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.772
STAFF THERE ONLY THREE FULL TIME

01:40:44.838 --> 01:40:45.506
EMPLOYEES AT THE FAIRGROUNDS

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:45.806
[inaudible]

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:49.309
HE HAD. FOUR FIVE MORE SEASONAL

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:49.843
WORKERS THAT WE BURNED OUT

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.413
WITHIN A MONTH -- THERE ARE.

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:54.548
THAT.

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.250
IS THE DAMAGE THAT MIGHT TAKE A

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:57.818
WHOLE NOTHER YEAR TO ACTUALLY

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:58.919
WORK THROUGH ANY START THING

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.254
ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ALL

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.355
THE RESEARCH THAT WENT INTO

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.890
VOLUNTEERISM ALL THE FARMERS THE

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.291
BROTHELS EVERYBODY'S GOT THIS

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:05.125
FATIGUE.

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:08.362
FROM AND THAT DID THAT EXISTS --

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.063
AND AND WHILE AS A COMMUNITY WE

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.832
CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESSES ON AND

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:12.766
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STILL

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:15.736
LINGERING THAT THE HAPPINESS

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:16.303
WEARS OFF AND YOU STILL HAVE

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:19.540
THAT -- FROM A FAIR NETWORK

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.408
POINT OF VIEW WHAT I THINK I'VE

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.878
GOTTEN OUT OF IT -- IS

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:26.213
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WHEN

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.614
IT WERE REPEATING THIS OVER AND

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:31.318
OVER THAT REALLY IS THE PLACE --

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:32.953
WE AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE GOING TO

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.288
THE PROCESS WE MAY END UP WITH A

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:35.355
FEMALE GRANT TO PUT INTO

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:37.057
EMERGENCY GENERATORS ON TO THE

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.625
BUILDINGS THAT I GOT A NEW POWER

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.359
PANELS.

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:40.627
THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LESS

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.196
AND SOME OF THE BURDEN EITHER ON

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.497
THE CAPACITY OF THE OUTSIDE

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.833
PEOPLE TRAINING POWER OR IF WE

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:46.867
TRULY HAD.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.702
A FOLLOW UP EMERGENCY LIKE BAD

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:49.903
TURN OFF THE POWER WE WOULD AND

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.972
IN THREE BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT --

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:55.008
BUT IT'S IT'S EVERYTHING --

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:57.211
POWER POWER BOXES THAT WERE USED

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:58.879
BY THE PEOPLE'S SLEEPING THE

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.747
TENTS IN THE RV'S.

01:42:00.814 --> 01:42:02.416
OUR PANEL'S EVER PLACED THERE IN

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.718
THE FIFTIES I MEAN HOW SAFE CAN

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:07.087
AB AND IN THE RAIN THERE IS A

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:07.688
PRICE ON HIS GUY.

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:11.492
AB GIVEN ELECTRIC SLEEPING

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.827
BLANKET A SLEEPING BAG.

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.195
AND IT'S RAINING IN THE AS A

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:18.765
PLUGGED IN AND I'M THINKING.

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:22.202
TRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:23.470
I COMMENTED TO HIM I'M NOT SURE

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:25.439
QUITE UNDERSTOOD.

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:27.174
WHILE I WAS THERE -- I THINK

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:28.742
ALSO AS A AS AN INDUSTRY WE'VE

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:29.343
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE THREE

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.544
OF US HAVE BEEN REALLY ENGAGED

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:32.279
IN THIS BUT THERE'S ABOUT.

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:34.014
THIRTY PEOPLE PROBABLY THE SAID

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.849
IN OUR INITIAL MEETINGS.

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:37.451
AND AND THE CITY OF A AND SAVE

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:39.219
US A WERE INVOLVED IN IT BUT WE

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.754
WE ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.856
SHOULD BE A DISASTER TEAM PUT

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:45.259
TOGETHER -- ONE COULD RESPOND

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:46.393
AND SAY FOUR HOURS YOU KNOW THAT

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.061
THEIR ME A CALL SERVICE

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.563
SOMEWHERE AND WOULD HAVE A ON

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:51.832
INVENTORY OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.300
CAN SERVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS.

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.469
BECAUSE IT TOOK YOU KNOW FIVE OR

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:56.837
SIX DAYS TO GET THIS THING

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:58.672
RUNNING RIGHT BUT IF THEY WERE.

01:42:58.739 --> 01:42:59.740
THREE CEOS AND THREE OFFICE

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.174
MANAGERS AND THREE FACILITY

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:02.509
MANAGERS.

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.177
IS THAT ONE WE PROBABLY COULD

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.279
HAVE DONE IT WITHIN A DAY

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.281
BECAUSE IT'S HE JUST CAN'T GET

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:08.882
EVERYWHERE AT ONCE -- I'M I'M

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:11.084
SURE ANY ANY FAIR MANAGER ANY

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.486
FACILITIES PERSON IF YOU HANNAH

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.054
MAP WHAT THE FAIRGROUNDS LOOKS

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.689
LIKE DURING A FAIR.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:17.024
CAN GO AND FIGURE THIS OUT IT'S

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.393
NOT THAT HARD SO WE WE JUST NEED

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.694
THAT RESOURCE THAT WHEN YOU TALK

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:21.962
ABOUT A STRIKE TEAM BASICALLY OF

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.997
FAIR MANAGERS OR STRAIGHT TEAM

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.666
OF STATE OFFICIALS AND IT WELL

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:26.967
IT WOULD BE IT WOULD.

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:27.968
IT WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.503
FAMILIAR WITH FAIRGROUND SO IT

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.972
WILL PROBABLY GO PRETTY DEEPLY

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:37.744
IN THE FACILITY SIDE OF THINGS --

01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:38.612
THEY WERE GETTING TO THE CRUISE

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.246
A CAME OUT AND HELPED US I MEAN

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:40.280
WE HAD SOME VERY EXPERIENCED

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.515
CREWS CAME OUT FROM LARGE FAIRS.

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.250
AND YOU KNOW YOU BRING FOR

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:44.785
PEOPLE THAT ALTHOUGH AS MUCH AS

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:45.752
OUR LEAD GUY.

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.120
AND THEY GO FIND THEIR OWN

01:43:47.187 --> 01:43:48.488
PROJECTS TO FIX AND THEY'LL HAVE

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:49.156
TO DO IS GIVE AN ACCOUNT AT THE

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.591
HARDWARE STORE THE STUFF IS

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:53.460
GETTING DONE -- THAT ALLOWED US

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:54.294
TO TAKE CARE SOME SAFETY ISSUES

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:55.896
THAT WE MIGHT STILL BE DEALING

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:58.799
WITH NOW IF THAT HAD COME SO --

01:43:58.865 --> 01:43:59.466
BUT IF THEY WERE THERE FROM THE

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:01.301
BEGINNING THAT WE COULD MAYBE

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.836
PREVENTED SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.371
MAYBEWE COULD SET O. G. THOSE

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:05.706
FAR FOUR PANELS OVER THERE NEED

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:06.673
SOME WORK LET'S JUST.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.942
NOT EVEN USING FOR THE NEXT

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:09.743
FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND FIX THEM

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:09.977
FIRST.

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.712
THAT KIND SORT OF THING -- AND

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:14.881
THEN ALSO THE RAPID ACCESS -- TO

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:19.086
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT -- RED

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:20.320
CROSS.

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:22.189
AND CALLOW YES WHEN THE TWO

01:44:22.255 --> 01:44:23.790
DIFFERENT FORKLIFTS FOR THE

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:25.492
EIGHT OUR SMALL FLEET OF ANCIENT

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:26.593
FORKLIFTS.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.629
AND NEITHER ROOM CAME WITH THE

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.664
WITH THE LIFT COULDRETAIN THE

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:32.065
ROTATING LISTS.

01:44:32.132 --> 01:44:33.367
SO YOU CAN'T GET TRACTION ARE

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:35.335
BROWN'S YOU CAN'T MOVE YOU CAN'T

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.670
REALLY MOVE MUCH OF ANYTHING

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:39.873
WITH THOSE -- AND THE NEWEST

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.342
FORKLIFT WE OWN IS -- SEVENTY

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:43.877
NINE AND THAT PERISHED IN THIS

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:46.079
BATTLE -- WE ARE NOW ACTIVELY

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.781
SEEKING USED ONE TO REPLACE IT

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.449
AND THE OTHER TWO ARE CRIPPLED

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.351
FROM IT AND AND THAT'S THOSE ARE

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:52.986
DATED A OPERATING MACHINES WE

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:53.854
NEED ALL THE TIME.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.956
SO COME BY A FAIR TIME IN TWO

01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:57.190
MONTHS WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:59.693
PROBLEM -- BUT IT IT REALLY IS

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.328
MORE TO THE IMMEDIATE NEED OF

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.030
THE DISASTER NOT SO MUCH OF THE

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:04.665
FAIRGROUND THAT HAD.

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.500
HAD THERE BEEN SOMEWHERE TO

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:07.901
APPROPRIATE NEW FORKLIFTS

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.369
OCCURRED JUST WHOOPED IN FOR

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:11.038
THIRTY DAYS AND THEN GONE BACK

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:12.606
TO WHERE THEY LIVE EVEN IF IT

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.940
WAS RENTED BY SOMEBODY BUT THEY

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:18.445
HAVE TO BE SET UP TO WORK ON THE

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:20.514
FAIRGROUNDS WILL GO ON TURF.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.748
BE ABLE TO GO IN THE WET IN BE

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:22.949
ABLE TO OPERATE THIS IS A THE

01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:24.951
NEED -- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:25.852
ACQUIRING A LOT OF LIVESTOCK

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.754
PANELS BUT THE NEED FOR PANELS

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:29.556
IS SO IMMENSE IN SUCH A SHORT

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:30.157
TIME.

01:45:30.223 --> 01:45:31.024
THAT NUMBER OF COURSES

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:32.259
DESCENDING ON OUR PROPERTY IN

01:45:32.325 --> 01:45:36.563
SUCH A SHORT PERIOD TIME WAS --

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.364
THE PROPERTY HANDLE THAT FIND

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:38.965
THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS IN IN

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:40.300
SHORT SUPPLY AND AND WE ARE

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.868
DOUBLING AND TRIPLING ANIMALS

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.570
WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:45.439
FOR A DAY OR TWO UNTIL.

01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:46.540
TRUCKLOADS CAM -- TO TAKE CARE

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:47.541
OF IT.

01:45:47.607 --> 01:45:49.176
GENERATORS TRACTORS TENTS LIGHT

01:45:49.242 --> 01:45:50.911
TOWERS ALL THE SAME SORT OF

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:52.546
STUFF THAT EVERYBODY WOULD NEED

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:54.181
IF IF IT IF IT WERE.

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:56.216
GIVEN TOWARD AROUND THE GROUNDS

01:45:56.283 --> 01:45:57.484
AND WE COULD SAY WELL OF A FLAT

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.119
BED CAME UP FROM THE CENTRAL

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.053
PART OF THE STATE.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.955
AM STOP AT THREE THREE

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:02.889
FAIRGROUNDS ON THE WAY UP HERE.

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:04.391
AND EACH HADSOME PIECE OF

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:05.926
EQUIPMENT MEANT FOR DISASTER

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:07.494
THAT WAS SAVED FOR THAT THEY

01:46:07.561 --> 01:46:09.129
START ON THE TRUCK AND BRING IT.

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:09.763
INTO THE NEXT FAIRGROUNDS THAT

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:13.133
WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.503
A REALLY GOOD THING TO PLAN --

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:17.871
FOR THAT WAS CARRYING HIM MY

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:19.539
MARK ALL.

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:24.745
RECORD WITH ONE MORE THING.

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:25.545
WHEN NEW AREA THE FAIRGROUNDS

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:26.646
RECENTLY HAVE GOTTEN INTO SPACE

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:27.180
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA --

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.048
WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.282
CAL FIRE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:30.050
EXPERIENCE RECENT EVACUATION

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:31.184
CENTERS BUT IT WAS THE P.

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:33.153
JEANNIE BASE CAMPS WHICH IS

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.021
REALLY -- WORKING WITH PRIVATE

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:37.124
ENTERPRISE -- FOR THE SAKE OF

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.792
SOME OF THE RESPONSE --

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:39.726
ORIGINALLY THESE BASE CAMP

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:41.261
AGREEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.530
WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR IN THEIR

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:44.464
MIND YOU KNOW AFTERWARDS FOR

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.133
THEM TO COME IN RESTORE POWER

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.702
AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- IN TWO

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.337
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AS YOU I'M

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:52.205
SERVE WELL AWARE PM P. JEANNIE

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:53.874
HAD TO CLEAR ALL OF THE THE

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.475
LINES AND SO WHAT THEY DID IS

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.910
THEY ACTIVATED MANY OF THESE

01:46:56.977 --> 01:46:58.979
BASE CAMPS CALISTOGA WAS ONE OF

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.113
THOSE.

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.149
AND UTILIZED -- SIGNIFICANT

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:03.150
PORTION OF OUR PROPERTY FOR

01:47:03.216 --> 01:47:04.985
ABOUT THREE MONTHS BUT ONE THING

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.153
THAT'S INTERESTING AND DEALING

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:08.088
WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISES WHEN IT

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.856
FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY.

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:14.161
THE FAIRS LEFT WITH AN IRA YOU.

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:14.928
AND THAT THAT CAL STARTED

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.062
FAIRGROUNDS IS STILL TRYING TO

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.265
COLLECT ABOUT A SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:21.334
DOLLAR DEBT FROM P. JEANNIE. FOR

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:22.669
THE USE OF THE FACILITY IN

01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:25.172
RESPONSE TO THIS SO THAT'S I

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:26.339
THINK THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ELSE --

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:28.041
MAYBE TO PERHAPS TAKE INTO

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:29.309
CONSIDERATION AND A LESSON FOR

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:31.144
ALL OF US IS HOW DID HOW WILL IT

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:33.647
WORK WITH THESE PUBLIC ASSETS.

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:36.216
AND AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WHEN

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:37.717
WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOU

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:38.485
KNOW.

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:41.087
HOW THEIR BUSINESS -- MAY GO IN

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:43.490
THE FUTURE.

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:44.257
AND RIGHT NOW UPSTAIRS AND

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:47.561
UTILITIES ARE HAVING A A HEARING

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.596
ON ON ON WELL.

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:52.732
MY U. S..

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.167
AND JUST HE RICK OF JUST GIVING

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:54.467
ONE SECOND.

01:47:54.534 --> 01:47:55.836
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT.

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:58.038

01:50:43.336 --> 01:50:45.071
KNOWLEDGE AND SPREAD IT ACROSS

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:46.606
THE ENTIRE STATE WE'VE SET UP

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.274
THIS NETWORK OF COUNTIES.

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:50.410
LET'S CREATE FIFTY FOUR DISTRICT

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:52.212
AGAS SO SHE HINS SMALL STATE

01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:53.480
AGENCIES.

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.248
PLACED ONE IN EACH COUNTY

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.950
ADDITIONALLY IT'S MORPHED OVER

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.518
TIME AND THEN.

01:50:58.585 --> 01:50:59.886
WE CAN START GETTING PEOPLE BACK

IN THE FARMING BACK AND ANIMAL

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:04.257
PRODUCTION BACK INTO FEEDING.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.192
LOCALLY AND THEY DID THAT TO

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:08.161
THIS CONCEPT OF COOPERATION AND

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:10.830
EDUCATION BUT IT WAS ALSO.

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.665
COMPETITION AND THEN YOU SHARE

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:14.367
THE RESULTS OF YOUR COMPETITION

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:15.602
AND THE PEOPLE WANNA EMULATE

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:17.904
THAT SUCCESS SO AS YOU TALK TO

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.139
THE FAIRS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY.

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:20.507
BEEN PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.308
DISASTER SERVICES WE'VE LEARNED

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:24.177
A LOT FROM EACH OTHER -- WE'VE

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:26.713
SHARED IDEAS WE SHARE DOCUMENTS

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.948
WITH -- YES AND CERTAINLY WITH

01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:30.216
APART THE FOOD AGRICULTURE.

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:32.285
BUT BUT TAKING THAT CONCEPT OF

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:33.686
WHERE WE ORIGINALLY CAME FROM.

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:35.989
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE FOUND

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:37.724
OURSELVES AGAIN AND JUST.

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:40.460
IN RECENT YEARS I BEING USED TO

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.061
DEAL WITH SOME OF THE MERGING

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:42.929
SEES THAT PREPARE FACED BY THE

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:47.033
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.268
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT.

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.102
CALYX WILL BE A LITTLE BIT

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:49.869
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOME OF THE

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:50.403
FAIRS YOU'VE HEARD FROM.

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.138
A WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT UNFUNDED

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.873
STATE AGENCIES SO WE'RE NOT

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.575
TUCKED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.177
DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE.

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:58.711
WE SET OUT HERE AS PART OF THE

01:51:58.778 --> 01:52:00.747
ADMINISTRATION -- AND AND

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:02.715
BECAUSE OF THAT WE ALSO HAVE A

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:03.983
DIFFERENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.718
WITH -- YES AND FOOD NAG VERY

01:52:05.785 --> 01:52:08.054
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS -- SO --

01:52:08.121 --> 01:52:09.122
YES IS OPEN THIS UP SEVERAL

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.591
TIMES IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:13.359
THE OROVILLE DAM INCIDENT WE

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:15.562
WERE IN MEDIATIVE ACTUATION SITE

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:16.863
BASED ON HOW WATER WOULD COULD

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.531
HAVE POTENTIALLY PHONE -- FOR

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.100
ANIMALS FOR PEOPLE.

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:22.669
THE FIRE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FIRES --

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:25.505
THAT THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE GET

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:26.606
OPENED UP FOR THAT.

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:27.774
THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOESN'T SEE

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:30.276
ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAL EXPO

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:31.845
IS THE GOLD COUNTRY.

01:52:31.911 --> 01:52:33.613
ACHEI NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RED

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.115
CROSS HEADQUARTERS.

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:36.349
SO WHEN THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.884
PEOPLE FLOODING INTO CALIFORNIA

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:39.686
FLYING INTO THE AIRPORT DRIVING

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:42.322
IN AS VOLUNTEERS WERE THEY KEEP

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:44.023
THEM WHERE THEY STAGE A MULTI

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.958
STAGE ONLY COUNT LIKE SPOT.

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:46.926
SO WE CAN PICK UP FOR FIVE

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:48.394
HUNDRED RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS IN

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:49.996
A MATTER OF A DAY OR TWO AND

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.097
THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL PEOPLE

01:52:51.164 --> 01:52:52.899
LEAVING THEIR THEIR LIFE BEHIND

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.801
ON HOLD IN THE MIDWEST AND

01:52:54.868 --> 01:52:56.569
COMING TO HELP US IN CALIFORNIA --

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:57.904
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE

01:52:57.971 --> 01:52:59.572
WHERE THEY CAN BE FED AND THEY

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.808
CAN BE REDEPLOYED -- EIGHT

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:03.109
COMPUTERS.

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:05.111
WIFI ACCESS AT SUTTER SUBTLY --

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:06.779
YES HAS WORKED WITH US AND AND

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:10.984
PERHAPS DIFFERENT WAYS -- FOR

01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:12.185
EXAMPLE ON ON ONE DAY DURING THE

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.086
OROVILLE DAM INCIDENT WE

01:53:13.153 --> 01:53:14.721
DISTRIBUTED SIXTEEN THOUSAND

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.089
LUNCHES.

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:17.624
ANOTHER WORDS A COLLECTION HUB

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.659
AND THEN A REDISTRIBUTION OUT TO

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:21.628
TWO OTHER FAIRS -- WE TALKED

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:22.996
ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF LOANING

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:24.731
EQUIPMENT OUT OR SENDING A LARGE

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.099
ANIMAL PANELS A COUPLE

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.534
TRUCKLOADS UP.

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.068
UP NORTH.

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.637
DURING ONE OF THE FAIRS ONE OF

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.972
THE FIRES WE TOOK ONE OF OUR

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:34.541
BACKUP RADIO SYSTEMS.

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:36.409
AND DROVE IT UP TO CALAVERAS

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:38.378
COUNTY AND SET UP AN ENTIRE

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:40.780
RADIO NETWORK COMMUNICATION

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:42.315
BECAUSE CELL TOWERS WERE GONE.

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:43.917
LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD TALK THE

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.485
FAIR PEOPLE COULDN'T TALK

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:47.220
BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY AFFAIR

01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:48.788
WILL RUN A RADIO SYSTEM DURING A

01:53:48.855 --> 01:53:49.956
FAIR.

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:51.925
AS SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:52.892
FAIRS FAIR.

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.794
SO SO WE LOOK AT THOSE TYPES OF

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:55.562
THINGS.

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:57.830
AND THEN WE LOOK AT CAL EXPO AND

01:53:57.897 --> 01:53:59.299
IT'S AN PART OF ITS IN THAT

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:01.234
CONCEPT IN TWENTY TEN STUDY THAT

01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:02.035
YOU HAVE HERE.

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:03.469
BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:05.405
DETERMINED CAL EXPO IS THE

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.873
NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.741
STOCKPILE FOR ALL OF NORTHERN

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:10.276
CALIFORNIA IN THE EVENT OF A

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:11.911
PANDEMIC.

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:13.379
SO WHAT WOULD THEY EXPLAIN IT TO

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:15.114
US OF THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:16.382
HAPPENS THEY WILL FRIENDS OFF

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:17.584
CAL EXPO.

01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:18.518
AND ALL THE HOSPITALS IN

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:20.119
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.555
THEIR SUPPLIES FROM THAT FEDERAL

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.257
PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKPILE -- THE

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:25.925
STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:27.060
TO THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:29.128
HAS DESIGNATED CAL EXPO NOW AS A

01:54:29.195 --> 01:54:30.797
FALL BACK CD GOVERNMENT. FOR

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:32.565
CONTINUITY PURPOSES SO THE

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:35.168
CAPITAL HAS EMERGENCY EVACUATION

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:37.170
HALF THE MEMBERS AND STAFF

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.738
ADMINISTRATION GO TO HIGHWAY

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.440
PATROL HEADQUARTERS HALF GO TO

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.408
CAL EXPO.

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:42.909
SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE'VE

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:44.577
RECEIVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.246
HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS TO THE

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:48.114
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE THAT

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:50.183
HAS ALLOWED US TO ENHANCE OUR

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:52.952
OUR WIFI IS SUPER SPEED NOW.

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:53.953
BECAUSE ALL EVERYONE IN THIS

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:56.122
ROOM MORE LIKELY MIGHT GO TO

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.824
CALYX WILL WITH THE COMPUTER OR

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.058
PHONE INDEED TO CONDUCT THE

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:00.827
STATE'S BUSINESS.

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.262
SO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE --

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.497
CALYX WILL ALSO HAS SOME OF ITS

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:06.299
OWN POWER GENERATION ABILITY HAS

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.734
A ONE MEGAWATT PHOTOVOLTAIC

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.068
PROJECT THAT'S BEEN AROUND A

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.270
LONG TIME.

01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:11.671
AND WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.306
OUR LOCAL UTILITY COMPANY AND

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:14.941
TGS FOR POTENTIAL FIFTEEN

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.709
MEGAWATT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALSO

01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:18.978
INCLUDE DEEP BATTERY STORAGE.

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:20.580
SO NOT ONLY COULD WE PRODUCE IT

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:21.948
BUT WE CAN BECOME IN ESSENCE A

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:24.384
MIKE REGRETTED AS AS A FALL BACK

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.918
SEE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE STATE

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:27.820
SO THOSE TYPES OF NEGOTIATIONS.

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.355
I CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE.

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:34.994
CALLASPO BY STATUE ALSO HAS ITS

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:36.062
OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT.

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:36.696
THOSE POLICE OFFICERS ARE WITH

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:37.563
US PART TIME FULL TIME SEASONAL

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:38.498
WE HAVE OUR OWN JAIL FACILITIES

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:40.433
ARE OFFICERS ACTUALLY HAVE

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.535
STATEWIDE POLICING AUTHORITY.

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:44.537
SO WE DO ASSIST OF THE COUNTY

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:46.939
THE CITY THE PARK RANGERS AT

01:55:47.006 --> 01:55:49.008
CENTER ON CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT

01:55:49.075 --> 01:55:51.277
AND WE ARE PART OF THE CIVIL

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:52.779
UNREST PLAN FOR THE SACRAMENTO

01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.347
REGION IN FACT WE'VE MOST

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:55.715
RECENTLY WERE.

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.549
CALLED UPON BY THE CITY OF

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.151
SACRAMENTO TO SUPPORT THEM WITH

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.153
SOME OF THEIR CIVIL UNREST -- SO

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:01.754
THEY ACTUALLY USE CAL EXPOSE THE

01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:03.656
STAGING LOCATION FOR YOUNG

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:04.857

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:07.427
AND AND A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:09.829
DETAILS ON CALLASPO'S DESIGNATED

01:56:09.896 --> 01:56:12.298
BY SAM CISCO BAY AREA AS A KEY

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:14.534
TSUNAMI RECOVERY FACILITY YOU

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.468
MENTIONED THE FLOODING A LITTLE

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:16.002
BIT EARLIER.

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:17.804
HOW FAR WOULD THE TSUNAMI WAVE

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:19.372
COME THROUGH THE BAY AREA TO

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:20.606
FAIRFIELD IT'S ULTRA THEY

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:22.041
BELIEVE CAL EXPO IS FAR ENOUGH

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:25.211
AN ELEVATED SLIGHTLY HIGH ENOUGH --

01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:27.046
THAT WE'D BE A KEY FACILITY IN

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:28.381
THE EVENT OF A TSUNAMI IN THE

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:30.983
BAY AREA -- CALYX WILL LIKE

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:32.151
OTHER FAIRS HAS QUITE A WORKED

01:56:32.218 --> 01:56:34.320
WITH FEMA TO ESTABLISH FEMA

01:56:34.387 --> 01:56:37.023
TRAILERS FOR HOUSING OF OF SOME

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:37.423
OF THE FAMILIES.

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:38.424
AND WE'VE.

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:39.926
WHILE THE RELATIONSHIP INITIALLY

01:56:39.992 --> 01:56:41.627
IS VERY POSITIVE WITH FEMA ONCE

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:44.964
THEY'RE DONE THEY LEAVE.

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:47.233
AND THEN.

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:47.800
EVERYTHING IS LEFT BEHIND.

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:48.735
AT THE THE CONCEPT OF RED CROSS

01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:51.070
WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS TRAIN SITE

01:56:51.137 --> 01:56:52.872
MANAGERS IN MANY CASES BUT THEY

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.474
ROTATE BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.175
THE CRISIS ON THE COMING FROM

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.043
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:56:57.110 --> 01:56:58.211
YOU MAY HAVE A OUTSTANDING

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.746
SHELTER MANAGER FOR A DAY OR TWO

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:02.148
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.616
STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:04.784
THIS FROM SCRATCH MEANING HERE'S

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.119
THE RESTROOM HERE'S THE SIGNED

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:07.019
AGREEMENT.

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.421
THERE'S ALSO NO INSURANCE THAT

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:10.823
COMES WITH A DEAL WITH RED CROSS.

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.759
IN FACT IT SAYS THEY'RE NOT

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:14.026
INSURANCE INSURING YOU.

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:16.396
IN OUR CASE -- WITH RED CROSS WE

01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:17.997
RENTED THE SAME ISSUES WITH A

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:19.799
SMALL ANIMALS AND LARGE ANIMALS

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:20.733
THAT'S NOT.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.402
IN THEIR PURVIEW BUT BECAUSE

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:23.236
WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT STATE

01:57:23.302 --> 01:57:24.804
AGENCY WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:25.838
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:28.441
INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY AND CAL --

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:31.110
YES LEGAL COUNSEL INVOLVED AND

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:32.712
CAME UP WITH SOME LIGHT CAME UP

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:34.046
WITH SOME INSURANCE DOCUMENTS SO

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:35.648
THAT IF YOU SIGN THE DOCUMENT

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.483
YOU COULD BRING YOUR PET AND BUT

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:39.685
IT'S BASICALLY OF YOUR PASSWORD

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:42.221
TO BITE SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:42.822
I HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET THAT.

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.624
ALL OF US.

01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:45.658
ENSURE THE PROPERTIES AND

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.827
FACILITIES WITH NO FUNDING FROM

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:48.761
THE STATE.

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.062
SO IN THE CASE A CAL EXPO OF A

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:52.331
DOG BITE SOMEBODY IT'S CAL

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:53.833
EXPOSE SELF INSURED BY.

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.635
THE POLICY CALLASPO'S PAID FOR

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:56.736
ON ITS OWN.

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:58.638
SO THERE IS NO INSURANCE FOR

01:57:58.704 --> 01:58:00.907
THESE FAIRS SO WHEN SOMETHING

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:03.109
HAPPENS WE GET SUED. FOR EXAMPLE

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:05.211
OF A SHELTER OPENS UP AND AND

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.946
LOCAL HOMELESS COME IN.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:09.048
A RED ROSS IS VERY CLEAR THEY

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:10.783
THEY WILL NOT PICK AND CHOOSE.

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.585
YA COME WHICH IS GREAT BUT ONE

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:14.387
RED CROSS LEAVES WHATEVER IS

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.122
LEFT IS LEFT.

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:17.924
SO THEN AS A STATE AGENCY ON

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:19.392
SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE'VE BEEN

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:21.828
LEFT WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.129
THAT ARE NOW HOURS.

01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:25.064
UNTIL WE CAN WORK WITH THE LOCAL

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.899

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:29.535
ASSIST THOSE.

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.904
AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN A

01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:33.806
HOMELESS PERSON GOT INTO THE

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:35.708
SHELTER NEXT TO A FAMILY.

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:36.976
THE FAMILY.

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:38.478
IS ALREADY GOING THROUGH DRESS

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:40.012
AND STRESS AND NOW THEY'RE

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.647
LOOKING AT THAT PERSON WHO'S

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:42.515
JUST NOT QUITE.

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:43.916
WHAT THEY'RE USED TO IN THEIR

01:58:43.983 --> 01:58:45.318
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR

01:58:45.384 --> 01:58:47.453
KIDS ARE PANICKED TO PETS ARE

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.257
PANICKED -- THE THE THE RED

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:53.226
CROSS WORKERS ARE.

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:54.026
ALL YOU GUYS DEAL WITH THAT.

01:58:54.093 --> 01:58:54.627
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THEIR SKILL

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:55.862
SET THEIR WONDERFULLY

01:58:55.928 --> 01:58:58.731
WONDERFULLY BIG HEARTED PEOPLE --

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:00.233
FROM CAL EXPOSE POINT OF VIEW.

01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:01.834
WE DECIDED THAT BECAUSE WE'RE AN

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.069
INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:04.770
ALTHOUGH WE HAD ASKED EDS AND

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.038
OTHER AGENCIES TO DO A

01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:07.840
INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY A SMALL

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:09.075
CESSNA THEY SAID.

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:11.410
YOU'RE NOT PART OF US A SO WE

01:59:11.477 --> 01:59:13.079
HIRED ZERO WEST ZERO WEST CAME

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:15.147
IN THIRD PARTY COMPANY APPROVED

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:17.083
BY A D. G. S. DEPARTMENT OF FOOD

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:18.317
AGRICULTURE.

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:19.719
AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY DIDN'T

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.187
INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:22.722
ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINED A

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:24.056
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.926
DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.861
TO PREPARE CAL EXPO FOR THE NEXT

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:29.962
FIFTY YEARS.

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:32.465
SO THAT'S POWER WATER SEWER A

01:59:32.532 --> 01:59:32.932
LOT OF THAT TYPE OF

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:35.067
INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ALSO CHANGES

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:37.203
AND SEISMIC STANDARDS ENERGY

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.938
REQUIREMENTS A NUMBER OF OF

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.706
OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PAY

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.141
ATTENTION TO BUT WHEN YEAR.

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.876
YOUR WERE AS GOVERNOR BROWN SAID

01:59:43.943 --> 01:59:46.078
IF WE DON'T FIX THE ROOF WE

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:46.712
REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT THE WALLS

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:47.013
LOOK LIKE.

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:49.782
SO SO THAT'S THE TYPE OF CONCEPT

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:51.551
THE TALENT THERE -- AS PART OF

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:53.319

BUDGET OF THE STATE FOR CALYX

02:00:06.365 --> 02:00:06.933
BLOW.

ON AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.002
AND WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:11.571
RIGHT DOWN THE LIST OF PROJECTS

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.005
THAT THAT THIRD PARTY STUDY SAID

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.507
YOU NEED TO DO THESE FIRST.

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:16.742
AND MOST OF THOSE ARE GEARED

02:00:16.809 --> 02:00:18.678
TOWARD EMERGENCY SERVICES.

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:20.046
IT TOOK THE STATE.

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:22.148
THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM IT'S

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:23.916
REALITY IT TOOK THE STATE SIX

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:25.351
AND A HALF MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:27.687
HOW TO MOVE SIX FIFTEEN MILLION

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:28.888
DOLLARS TO CAL EXPO.

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:31.357
BECAUSE WE DON'T EXIST.

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.259
IT'S IT'S BAFFLING WE WORKED

02:00:33.326 --> 02:00:34.560
WITH WELL SOME OF THOSE A

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:36.095
TRANSITION TEAM TRANSITIONING OF

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:38.331
GOVERNOR'S OTHER BUDGET ISSUES

02:00:38.397 --> 02:00:39.298
THAT WERE OUT THERE.

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.900
BUT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LINE

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:42.301

IN THE STATE FAIR.

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.807
SO WHILE -- YES WAS COOPERATIVE

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:48.708
FOOD NAG WAS COOPERATIVE

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:50.209

02:00:50.276 --> 02:00:52.478
COOPERATIVE THEY ALL SCRATCH

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:53.245
THEIR HEADS AND SAID.

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:54.447
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.948
THIS IS TO WRITE A FIFTEEN

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.717

BUT WHEN WE ASKED THE QUESTION

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.860
IS IF THIS BODY WANTED TO MOVE

02:01:07.927 --> 02:01:10.262

PUT IT.

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:16.135
THAT EXIST SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.603
COULD BE CORRECTED IN AND WE'RE

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:18.938

STRUCTURAL CHALLENGE.

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:36.088
SO WHEN WE WHEN WE MEET WITH

FOR SERVICES TO STATE AGENCIES.

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:17.223
BUT THOSE OTHER STATE AGENCIES

02:03:17.289 --> 02:03:18.457
ARE PROFOUNDLY SUPPORTED BY THE

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:19.692

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:45.651
BILLS FOR US TO LOOK AT YOUR

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:46.552

AND WE SAY BUT YOU DON'T

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:50.055
PROVIDERS COMPUTERS.

02:03:50.122 --> 02:03:51.757

AGENCY WE NEED TO BILL YOU.

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:54.426
AND IT I DON'T WANNA MAKE IT

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:55.161
SOUND LIKE.

02:03:55.227 --> 02:03:58.197
IT ALL GLOOM AND DOOM SB

02:03:58.264 --> 02:03:59.899
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE IS HELPFUL.

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:01.233
IN FACT WE HAD WORKED WITH --

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.234
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND MEMBERS

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:03.669
OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR SEVERAL

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:06.405
YEARS AND JUST TO GET THE POLICY

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:07.706
DECISION TO ALLOW PART OF THE

02:04:07.773 --> 02:04:09.909
SALES TAX TO COME BACK TO

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:11.210
SUPPORT THE NETWORK AFFAIRS.

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:14.146
THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.648
THREE QUARTERS OF 1%.

02:04:15.714 --> 02:04:17.149
SO IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT AND

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.852
MULTIPLY IT TIMES THE STATE'S 6%

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:22.121
WHAT SIX TIMES EIGHTEEN AND THAT

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:23.489
WOULD BE ON A LOW NUMBER.

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:24.824
SO SUDDENLY THE FARES ARE

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.559
GENERATING MORE THAN A HUNDRED

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:27.960
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:29.628
AND THIS IS SELF IDENTIFYING

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:31.130
SALES TAX IT WASN'T EVEN WASN'T

02:04:31.197 --> 02:04:33.299
EVEN THE FORM THAT ACTUALLY

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:35.568
TRACKED IT WAS SELF IDENTIFY --

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:36.602
SO IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.404
THE STATE AND COMPLIMENTS TO THE

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.272

BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:48.214
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.248

AND PAYS THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS --

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:25.144
SO GOOD THINGS IN CASE THE STATE

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:27.112

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:37.756
WINNING TEAM.

02:06:37.823 --> 02:06:38.824

ONE AND TWO TO THE OFFICE.

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.829
ALMOST EVERY OFFICE STAFF MEMBER

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:45.364
THAT COMES OUT SAYS.

02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:46.932
NO YOU GUYS ARE FULLY FUNDED BY

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.600

02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:00.112
HOW ARE YOU STILL IN EXISTENCE

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:01.647
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WON'T

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:02.681
BE.

02:07:02.748 --> 02:07:04.049
THIS MODEL FOR ALL THE FAIRS

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.851
CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE VERY FAR

02:07:05.918 --> 02:07:07.853
INTO THE FUTURE WITHOUT SOME

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.621
TYPE OF A FUNDING MECHANISM TO

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:10.489
SUPPORT HIM.

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.358

THERE WE REALIZE THE STATE HAS A

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:20.199
NUMBER OF FISCAL ITEMS TO DEAL

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:20.866
WITH.

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:21.900

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:23.669
BETTER THAN EDUCATION OUR ROADS

OUR PRISONS ARE ANY OF THOSE

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:26.338
THINGS WE'RE JUST SAYING

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:27.940
SUDDENLY BECAUSE WE'VE STEPPED

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:29.908
INTO THE SUMMER AGENCY SERVICES

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:32.678

GOD REQUEST NOT TAKING ANIMALS.

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:47.092
PROBLEM AS SOME KIND OF STRIKE

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:49.061
TEAM THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:52.431
HAVE -- TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY AS

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:53.732
NEEDED.

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:55.267

PERSON ARE SOMEWHAT DEDICATED

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.616
PERSON WITHIN CDFA THAT OVER

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.151
WOULD OVERSEE EVACUATIONS AND

02:08:12.217 --> 02:08:14.253
COORDINATE WITH FAIRS WITH --

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:15.854

THERE'S A LOT OF OPERATIONAL

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:21.560
ISSUES AND AND I WAS VERY.

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:22.861
CAUTIOUS NOT TO COME IN WITH A

WHOLE LIST OF THESE THIS IS

02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:25.764
TERRIBLE AND THIS HAPPENED TO

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:26.999
THIS WAS AWFUL BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.267
WONDERFUL THINGS REALLY DO

HAPPEN THOSE ACTIVATIONS -- BUT

02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:32.304
THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND I

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:34.406

MORE WE COULD HAVE ADDED TO THIS

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:52.958
THE DONATIONS THAT FLOODED IN IN

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:55.661

02:09:17.416 --> 02:09:18.650
EVACUATIONS AS WELL OF THE

02:09:18.717 --> 02:09:20.119
VALLEY FIRE THE NUMBER OF

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:21.620
DONATIONS THAT CAME INTO BECAUSE

THEY AREN'T NEW BRAND NEW AND

02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:25.924
BRAND NEW PACKAGING -- WERE

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:28.527
TURNED AWAY BY RED CROSS -- IN

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:31.430
THE END AFTER HOSTING

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:32.564
APPROXIMATELY.

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:33.232

FOR VOLUNTEER NONPROFIT

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:44.810
LEADERSHIP WE'RE ABLE TO

02:09:44.877 --> 02:09:48.413
COORDINATE WITH THEM ABOUT.

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.948

STOCKED WITH THE DONATIONS THAT

02:09:53.886 --> 02:09:55.754
WERE STILL LEFT ON OUR LITTLE

02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:57.256
SEVENTY ACRE FAIR GROUNDS --

02:09:57.322 --> 02:09:58.457
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO STORE IN

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:00.792
HOUSE FOR THE FUTURE NEEDS OF

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:03.328
LAKE COUNTY AND AND NOT FIRE SO

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:05.864
THEY'D SO DONATION MANAGEMENT

02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:07.432
THE ANIMAL MANAGEMENT THE

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:08.800
LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT OF IT JUST

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:11.303
WE'VE WITNESSED A LOT -- AS AN

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:12.804
INDUSTRY THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:14.973
ONE ANOTHER AND I THINK WE'RE

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:15.474
READY TO SHARE THAT WITH

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:17.442
EVERYONE. TO WHICH WOULD YOU AND

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:18.777
I BECAUSE I ASKED THE THE

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:19.845
DEPARTMENT FOLKS WHAT WHAT WITH

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:20.979
THE OVER THE COUNTER WITH THE

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.247
FEAR PEOPLE SAY IS THERE BUT

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:24.383
THEY DO TO THE BEST OF WHAT THEY

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:26.218
NEED THE MOST HELP WITH.

02:10:26.285 --> 02:10:27.586
SO I WOULD SAY.

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:30.756
A WHAT WE DO THE BEST IS IS IS

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:31.256
EVENTS.

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:35.027
AND OF OF DECORATION IS LIKE A

02:10:35.093 --> 02:10:36.662
LARGE EVENT YOU'RE TAKING CARE

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:38.397
OF PEOPLE YOU'RE FEEDING PEOPLE.

02:10:38.463 --> 02:10:40.299
YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF JANITORIAL

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:41.600

LARGE IN TERMS OF THAT -- WHAT

02:10:47.206 --> 02:10:49.041
WE HAVEN'T DONE IS HAVE PEOPLE

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:50.375
STAY OVERNIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:51.443
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STAY

OVERNIGHT AT YOUR FACILITY?

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:54.680
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A A

02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:56.415
LEARN A BIG LEARNING CURVE.

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:58.483
AND THEN -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE I

02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.219
THINK THAT'S WHERE CHALLENGES IS

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:03.889
THAT REALLY IS IS IS SUPPORTING

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:05.757
THAT IN.

02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:06.558
HE'S FROM FAIRGROUNDS TO

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.326
FAIRGROUNDS DEL MAR BUDGETS

02:11:07.392 --> 02:11:08.193
EVERY YEAR FOR AT LEAST WHEN I

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.661
WAS THERE WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:11:09.728 --> 02:11:10.862
DOLLARS EVERY YEAR JUST A SPIN

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:12.231
ON EVACUATION SEPARATE FAIR WILL.

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:13.632
MOST FAIRS DON'T HAVE THE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:15.400
ABILITY TO DO THAT --

02:11:15.467 --> 02:11:18.036
REIMBURSEMENT -- WE SENT A A

02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:20.672
BILL TO A RED CROSS FOR HUNDRED

02:11:20.739 --> 02:11:21.506
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A YEAR LATER

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:24.176
WE GOT A NOTE BACK THAT SAID

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:25.244
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION.

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:27.613
SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:28.947
FINANCIAL ASPECT OF IT BUT I

02:11:29.014 --> 02:11:31.216
THINK IT YOU KNOW AS A WHOLE I

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:32.718
THINK WE DO AN AMAZING JOB.

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:34.753
OF THE FAIR NETWORK OF HAVING

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.388
THAT TEAM TO PRODUCE AND TO DO

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:38.490
IT PUT AN EVENT ON THIS

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:40.626
EVACUATION OF AT WHAT WE DON'T

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.361
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IS IS

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:43.829
HAVE THE STRENGTH IN THE

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:44.563
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:46.198
AND HOW ABOUT FOR THE STATE BUT

02:11:46.265 --> 02:11:47.232
THE STATE AGENCIES WHAT COULD

THEY DO BETTER AND WHAT DO YOU

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.501
THINK THEY DO REALLY WELL I

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:50.769
THINK IT'S A COORDINATION I

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.771
THINK IT'S THE UNDERSTANDING --

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:54.940
I KNOW THAT -- CDFA THROUGH F.

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.175
ANY REALLY TRIED OTHER BEST A

02:11:57.242 --> 02:11:59.945
STATE CERTAINLY DURING OUR FIRES

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:02.080
TO STAY CONNECTED WITH ALL OF OF

02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:05.083
OF ALL THE FAIRS -- BUT I THINK

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:05.951
BETTER COORDINATION AND

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:09.421
UNDERSTANDING.

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:12.491
BETWEEN -- CALLAWAY US AND CDFA

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:14.359
AND AFFAIRS AS TO WHAT RE REALLY

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.894
NEED BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WERE

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:18.497
CHALLENGES WHEN WE CALLED F. ANY

02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:19.631
IT CDFA INSIDE CAM.

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:21.933
CALLOWAY US DO THIS AND THEY

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.368
WERE SO.

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.936
BOGGED DOWN BY DEALING WITH ALL

02:12:25.003 --> 02:12:25.637
THE OTHER FAIRS YOU KNOW

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.572
RESPONSE WAS DIFFICULT TO GET

02:12:27.639 --> 02:12:29.374
BACK NOT TO SAY THEY WERE TRYING

02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:30.575
THEIR BEST IT'S JUST.

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:31.677
IT'S JUST KIND OF THE

02:12:31.743 --> 02:12:33.745
OPERATIONAL AND STAFFING

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:36.148
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK IS A

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:38.517
CHALLENGE -- I WOULD PART I

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:39.618
WOULD ECHO THAT AND SAY THAT

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:41.153
WOULD -- WHAT WE DO REALLY WELL

02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:42.020
AS WE SERVE?

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:43.055
WE SERVE PEOPLE I MEAN THERE

02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:44.589
WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS I'M JUST

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.591
LIKE YOU ARE AND AND WE SERVE

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:49.261
REALLY WELL AS AN AS AN INDUSTRY --

02:12:49.328 --> 02:12:50.562
WE'RE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT'S A

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.297
VERY MUCH ENGAGED IN THE

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:55.534
BUSINESS OF READING PEOPLE AND

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.134
AND THEIR NEEDS AND THEN IT

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:58.470
ENDED AND ADJUSTING TO THAT --

02:12:58.537 --> 02:12:59.971
YOU KNOW HUMAN BEHAVIORS AND

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:01.340
THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WE HAVE

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:03.208
AN INNATE ABILITY TO QUICKLY

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:04.910
RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS.

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:07.379
ON THE SIDE OF OF WHAT WE NEED

02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:09.581
YES IT'S IT'S MONEY -- YOU KNOW

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:11.283
IT'S FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:12.818
BUT I THINK ALSO TRAINING AND I

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:14.252
THINK AS FAR AS THE OTHER STATE

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:16.822
AGENCIES IT'S REALLY THE

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:17.989
FAIRGROUNDS INDUSTRY.

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:19.791
FALLS IN THE PRE PLANNING

02:13:19.858 --> 02:13:21.727
EFFORTS AS WELL -- SOMETIMES

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:23.328
THERE'S THERE IT BECOMES

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:26.365
CONFUSION OR OF THE LINES IN THE

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:27.833
BOUNDARIES IS THIS THE DA IS

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:29.201
THIS ACCOUNT E. FAIRGROUNDS IS

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:30.669
THIS THE CITRUS FAIRGROUNDS WHO

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:31.837
REALLY HAS THE ULTIMATE

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:33.739
AUTHORITY TO ACTIVATE THAT

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:36.441
PARTICULAR SITE -- WHO KNOWS IT

02:13:36.508 --> 02:13:38.643
BEST AND BESIDES US AND I THINK

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:41.213
THERE ARE ALSO REALLY INCREDIBLE --

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:43.115
TRAININGS AND STRUCTURES WITHIN

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:45.751
CAL WE **** AND WITHIN CAL FIRE

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:47.185
AND THEIR SYSTEM THAT WE USE THE

02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:50.222
FAIRGROUNDS COULD LEARN BECOME A

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:52.257
PART OF THOSE TRAININGS -- ADAPT

02:13:52.324 --> 02:13:53.825
TO SO THAT OUR SYSTEMS PLUG AND

02:13:53.892 --> 02:13:55.861
PLAY WITH VERY WELL TOGETHER --

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:56.461
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE SOARING

02:13:56.528 --> 02:14:02.768
OUT DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY WE'RE

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:08.206
STRUCTURED IN THAT SAME WAY.

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:09.074
HI I'M I WOULD BE A BROKEN

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:10.509
RECORD SAY ALMOST ALL THE SAME

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:11.176
THINGS -- BEING INCLUDED IN THE

02:14:11.243 --> 02:14:13.545
PLANNING PROCESS GOING FORWARD --

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:14.446
ARE FOR GRANTED NEVER BEEN

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:15.447
CALLED INTO PLAY.

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:16.081
WE LEARNED A LOT I THINK SOME OF

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:17.416
THE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE MIGHT

02:14:17.482 --> 02:14:20.352
NOT BE MIGHT BE THE RELATIVELY

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:22.087
UNCOMMON THING.

02:14:22.154 --> 02:14:24.322
AND WE DON'T KNOW THE ACCESS ALL

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:25.524
IN COMMON US BUT BUT IF WE'RE

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.993
USES A CASE STUDY RIGHT NOW

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:28.560
BEFORE WE ALL FORGET WHAT

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.595
HAPPENED -- THAT WOULD PROBABLY

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:32.330
BE REALLY VALUABLE TO OTHER

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:33.698
SMALL.

02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:35.667
RURAL FAIRS THAT DON'T

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:37.369
FAIRGROUNDS THAT DON'T HAVE.

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:39.037
DEEP POCKETS DON'T HAVE.

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:41.006
EXTRA PIECE OF EQUIPMENT LINE OR

02:14:41.072 --> 02:14:42.040
WHATEVER.

02:14:42.107 --> 02:14:43.308
IF WHAT I WOULD HOPE TO DO ONE

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:44.810
THING I APPLIED FOR A MOMENT WE

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.378
HAVE GOT A GRANT FOR IT YET WAS

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:47.412
TO ACTUALLY.

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:48.780
GET SOME FUNNY TO HAVE A

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.315
PROFESSIONAL EMERGENCY PLAN DONE

02:14:50.382 --> 02:14:51.850
FOR OUR GROUNDS.

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.018
SO WE CAN TURN AROUND WITH WITH

02:14:53.084 --> 02:14:55.086
THAT EXAMPLE IN PLACE AND THEN

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:56.588
SURE WITH THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE

02:14:56.655 --> 02:14:58.123
THEY'RE PROBABLY HALF OF THE

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.558
FAIRGROUNDS THAT WOULD GO --

02:14:59.624 --> 02:15:01.026
THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD COMMON

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:02.461
SENSE STUFF TO COME OUT OF THIS

02:15:02.527 --> 02:15:06.498
IN THE SUMMER LIKE JUST KNOWING

02:15:06.565 --> 02:15:08.834
THE CALLING AND SAID. TWO YEARS

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.669
AGO SAYING JUST YOU KNOW --

02:15:10.735 --> 02:15:11.236
UNDERGROUND LIKE YOU DO WITH

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:12.103
FEDERAL.

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:13.004
IF YOU IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:13.672
RINGING IN MY EARS WE WOULD ADD

02:15:13.738 --> 02:15:15.740
A PROBLEM THERE AND AND THAT'S

02:15:15.807 --> 02:15:16.374
THAT'S A PLACE WHERE I THINK WE

02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:16.708
CAN REALLY.

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:17.876
SCORE SOME POINTS WITHIN THE

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.544
WITHIN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:20.178
IF.

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:22.047
IF GALLO YES WAS INVOLVED IN

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:23.582
THAT RECROSS WAS A MODEL THAT

02:15:23.648 --> 02:15:24.783
AND THE ANIMAL SHELTER PEOPLE

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.585
INVOLVED AND YOU SEE DAVIS.

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.086
COME UP WITH ONE PLAN FOR ONE

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:31.423
PLACE AND THEN OTHERS CAN USE AS

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:34.459
A MODEL AND ADAPT FROM.

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:36.661
BOTTOM LINE WHERE EVENT PEOPLE.

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:38.296
FOR PUBLIC SERVICE -- WERE INTO

02:15:38.363 --> 02:15:40.799
FOOD PREP FOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:43.235
TOILETS EIGHTY A LOGISTICS LAY

02:15:43.301 --> 02:15:45.971
OUT THE OVERNIGHT IS A WRINKLE

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.772
THE DRUG USE OR MENTAL MENTAL

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:49.708
HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE RECALL.

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:51.743
THE TRAUMA COUNSELING FOR PEOPLE

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:52.944
THAT ARE COMING IN THAT OF LOST

02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:55.180
EVERYTHING IS NOT A SKILL SET OF

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.014
OURS AT ALL.

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:57.782
OUR VETERINARY SERVICES

02:15:57.849 --> 02:15:59.584
TYPICALLY ARE GEARED MORE TOWARD

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:01.253
REGULATIONS FOR COMPETITIVE

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:02.888
ANIMALS.

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:04.756
OUR VET SERVICES TYPICALLY ART

02:16:04.823 --> 02:16:07.192
GEARED TOWARD A RESCUE ANIMAL

02:16:07.259 --> 02:16:08.527
PER SE.

02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:10.362
SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BE VERY

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:11.396
HELPFUL.

02:16:11.463 --> 02:16:13.698
AND A HUGE HUGE COMPLIMENT TO

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:15.734
FOOD NAG N. TWO OH YES AND CAL

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:18.303
FIRE CLOSER DOING SO MANY THINGS

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.304
RIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.006
THE IMPRESSION I DON'T THINK ANY

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:21.473
OF US WANT TO GIVE THE

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:22.274
IMPRESSION THAT.

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:23.675
THE SKY HAS FALLEN AND WE DON'T

02:16:23.742 --> 02:16:24.876
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:26.311
I THINK MOST OF US ARE SAYING

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:30.849
WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD THIS

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:33.518
AIRPLANE WALLETS AND FLIGHT.

02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:35.453
GET GOOD KNOWLEDGE.

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.855
AND NOW I JUST REAL QUICK WITH

02:16:36.922 --> 02:16:37.455
THE WORKING WITH LOOKING AT

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:38.023
MENTAL HEALTH AND DRUG AND

02:16:38.089 --> 02:16:39.190
TRAUMA AND ALL THAT.

02:16:39.257 --> 02:16:40.792
HOW I MEAN ARE YOU WORKING WITH

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:41.960
THE COUNTIES WITHOUT A DOOR

THE SERVICES AND I GUESS WHAT'S

02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:46.965
THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY?

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:48.733
IT JUST DEPENDS.

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:52.270
IT REALLY DOES SO -- IN OUR IN

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:54.339
OUR CASE IN SNOW AS WE WORKED

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:55.941
WITH -- CATHOLIC CHARITIES THAT

02:16:56.007 --> 02:16:57.475
CAME IN AND WERE VERY HELPFUL

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.644
WITH OUR OUR HOMELESS FOLKS --

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:01.379
IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE WITH OF

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:02.447
FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE FEMA

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:03.815
TRAILERS BECAUSE FAMOUS NOT

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:06.451
SKILLED IN THAT AREA EITHER --

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:07.652
SO WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:10.221
VARIOUS AGENCIES TO TRY TO WORK

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.857
WITH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS --

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:13.491
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PARTICULAR

02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:14.826

AND STARTING TO YOU KNOW GO DOWN

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:21.399
THAT PATH -- SO YOU KNOW THOSE

02:17:21.466 --> 02:17:22.500
ORGANIZATIONS THOSE CHARITABLE

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:23.902
ORGANIZATIONS A DEAL WITH THAT

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:25.403
HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:26.972
COUNTY HELPED US -- WE ARE

HELP US WITH SOME OF THAT BUT

02:17:30.208 --> 02:17:31.943
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT.

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:34.546
THAT NEED TO BE IN THIS MIX --

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.047
BECAUSE IT IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:17:36.114 --> 02:17:37.949
PREVALENT IN EVERY SINGLE

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.117
EVACUATION.

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.218
ANY KIND OF TRAUMA IS GOING TO

02:17:40.285 --> 02:17:42.420
BRING UP I MEAN FOR YOUR PEOPLE

CASE OF CALISTOGA IN TWO

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:47.392
THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT PART OF

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:49.194
WHAT -- SO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.529
OFFICER I'M DISPATCH BASICALLY

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:53.064
OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:55.467
TEAM AND DISPATCHED OUR MENTAL

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:57.569
HEALTH SERVICES TEAMS AND THEY

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:59.337
WENT THROUGH AND MET WITH.

02:17:59.404 --> 02:18:02.007
A REPRESENTATIVE -- FOR ANY

02:18:02.073 --> 02:18:03.842
FAMILY AND DID A QUé OF FULL

02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:06.077
HEALTH ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:07.579
BECAUSE IT WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW A

02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:09.180
FEW DAYS INTO IT YOU'RE STARTING

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:10.749
TO SEE SOME OF THE SIGNS AND YOU

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:11.416
AREN'T SURE.

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.484
AND ESPECIALLY AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:14.019
HAVE LEFT WITH NOTHING THEY

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:14.986
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:17.355
MEDICATIONS WITH THEM EVEN.

02:18:17.422 --> 02:18:18.623
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:20.659
ILLEGAL DRUG USERS -- BUT YOU

02:18:20.725 --> 02:18:21.459
KNOW GETTING THEIR THEIR

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.194
MEDICATIONS TO THEM AND THE

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:24.496
RIGHT ONES AND YET THEY DON'T

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:25.430
HAVE ID.

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:27.532
NECESSARILY THEY HAVE NOTHING TO

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:30.669
SHOW -- WHO THEY ARE MAIL

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:36.741
SERVICE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM --

02:18:36.808 --> 02:18:37.642
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GET

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:38.443
THEIR MAIL WITHOUT AN ID THAT

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:39.878
SAYS THAT THEY ACTUALLY LIVE AT

02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:40.545
THAT ADDRESS IT'S WHERE YOU KNOW

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:41.179
THE FRAUD AND THINGS LIKE THAT

02:18:41.246 --> 02:18:42.580
COME INTO PLAY -- BUT I THINK --

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:43.648
WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:46.985
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN --

02:18:47.052 --> 02:18:48.520
ENGAGED IN THESE YOU KNOW

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:49.988
EVACUATIONS IN SHELTERS IN THAT

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:52.457
THE RECENT YEARS -- THERE ARE

02:18:52.524 --> 02:18:54.693
SOME MORE INTEGRATED RESOURCES

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:56.194
AND IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING FROM
