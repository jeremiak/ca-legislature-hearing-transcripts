WHILE THIRD PARTY FINANCING MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN PATIENTS NEED SERVICES THAT THEY CANNOT IMMEDIATELY PAY THIS BILL SENATE BILL SIX THREE NINE IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AMONG THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE ASSEMBLY OF LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE BILL NO LONGER BANDS DEFERRED INTEREST OUT RIGHT. INSTEAD PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR DEFERRED INTEREST MUST SIGN UP DIRECTLY WITH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT SIGNING UP FOR A PROVIDER PAYMENT PLAN AND THAT THE TERMS OF THE PRODUCT ARE CLEAR AND UNDERSTOOD. THAT'S WHY THE FOCUS OF THIS GOAL THE OF THIS BILL IS CONSUMER PROTECTION. PROVIDERS AREN'T FINANCIAL EXPERTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PATIENCE COMPLETELY TRUST THEM. OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CLARIFY THAT MEDICAL PROVIDERS CAN INFORM PATIENTS ABOUT PAYMENT OPTIONS THEY JUST CAN'T SIGN PEOPLE UP DIRECTLY. THEY MUST GIVE PATIENTS THE OPTION TO REVIEW FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE TREATMENT AREA. THEY CAN ONLY CHARGE PATIENTS FOR SERVICES THAT WILL BE RENDERED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IF THE PROVIDER IS USING A THIRD PARTY CREDIT OR LOANS TO PAY FOR SERVICES THE EXAMPLE FOR THAT COLLEAGUES IS IF YOU GO IN AND YOU NEED A ROOT CANAL YOU'RE HAVING AN- IMPLANTED IT MAY TAKE. MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS OVER THE SPAN OF NINE MONTHS OR A YEAR THEY CAN'T CHARGE YOU FOR THE FULL SERVICES BEYOND THIRTY DAYS COULD YOU MIGHT NOT RETURN. AND COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TREATMENT PLAN. THEY MAY STILL OFFER PATIENTS CREDIT CARDS PERIOD. THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM PRE FILLING APPLICATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENT. AND WE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN ALL EFFORTS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND STILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CREDIT WHEN THEY NEEDED TO PAY FOR NECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES PRIMARILY DENTAL SERVICES WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON CONCURRENCE.

AS WE SEE FIRE SEASONS GOING ON OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND THE THREADS THEIR THREATS AND THEN THE- OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO DE ENERGIZED WILL LIKELY CREATE LOTS OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO OUR ECONOMY. TO OUR OF BUSINESSES THAT. NEED DAD ELECTRICITY TO OUR OWN SYSTEMS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE IT ELECTRICAL PRODUCTION REDUCED TURNED OFF ON SPENT THIS IS A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT. ASPECT OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO BOTH HOLISTICALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THE FIRE PROBLEM THE ANSWERS IN CHAU SHUTTING OFF THE ELECTRICITY IS I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS WELL AWARE BUT THIS IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO GETTING THIS DISCUSSION GOING. SO THAT WE CAN CONSIDER ALL OF THE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EFFORT AND WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AND I VOTE.

MISSED IN AND I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THIS BILL IS MY FIRST TIME SEEING I READ IT THIS MORNING AND. WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD DEBATE ON THE- HE SEES. REGULATION TO ADD SOLAR TO HOMES IN THAT CAME OUT OF THEM IN THE AND WE GAVE THEM THE POWER TO DO THAT IN THE WAY I READ THIS BILL IS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE POWER OF THE CC ENTITY DEBBIE ARE TO. HAVE REGULATING POWER WE'RE GONNA ADD FIVE OR FIVE OR SO POSITION IS THE WAY I READ IT WHICH IS COSTLY. AND ALSO. THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS IN IN THAT WITH YOU HAVE YOU ARE. SO I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ALLOWING. GIVING UP A LOT OF POWER OF OUR AUTHORITY IN. IN GIVING THE C. C. AND THE W. R. REGULATORY POWERS WITHOUT COMING BACK TO THIS BODY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I STAND IN OPPOSITION OF A THIS BILL OF THE WAY I READ IT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GIVING TOO MUCH DISCRETION TO THESE BUREAUCRACIES. AND THEN NOW WE HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE AND WE TALKED ABOUT. THE LEGISLATION FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE PLENTY OF SOLAR WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE WE'RE REGULATING THAT IN THIS CASE WE MAY BE DOING THE SAME THING ON THESE EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. WHERE WE COULD SPEND THAT MONEY MORE WISELY TO REDUCE. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. AND FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD BE DOING MORE IN THE FORESTRY TO REDUCE OUR CARBON. THEN FORCING IT ON TRANSPORTATION SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF TAKE DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE AT THIS LEVEL AND NOT ALLOW THE PURE BUREAUCRATS TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WITHOUT OUR INPUT SORRY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BUT HEARD OF. NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. THURS CAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THANK YOU. THE BILL DOES NOT GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF RIDE D. W. R. ANY AUTHORITY. ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY. AND IT DOES NOT GIVE THEM FINING OF FOUR THIRTY. THIRTY IN ACCURATE READ OF THE BILL. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IT'S ABOUT QUOTE UNQUOTE SMART APPLIANCES WHICH ARE THE TYPE OF APPLIANCES THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU IT I COULD CONTROL. VIA OUR TELEPHONES AND ALREADY OUR STATE HAS WHAT'S CALLED TIME OF USE RATES. SO THOSE OF US WHO DON'T REALIZE THAT WHEN OUR APPLIANCES ARE RUNNING DURING THE HIGHEST PRICE RATES. AND IF WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEN OUR BILLS ARE HIGHER. THAN THEY NEED TO BE AND WITH SMART APPLIANCES AND ARE THE PHONES RIGHT HERE WE COULD AFFECT THAT AND THUS LOWER OUR BILLS AND THAT'S REALLY THE ENTIRE.

DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR STONE. GOOD MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT THIRTY SIX HOURS TO GO. HI RISE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWO SIXTY SIX THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW RIGHT HIGHER READ TO RECEIVE AND CORRECTLY CALCULATED PENSION BENEFITS WERE AN ERROR RESULTS IN PAYING THAT RETIREE HIGHER PENSION BENEFITS AND ALLOWED BY LAW. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO HERE AND QUITE FRANKLY I SHARE THE VIEW WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO THAT PENSIONS MUST BE CORRECTED AND CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. TIRED OF STATE PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD NEVER. NEVER FIND THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK FOR OVERPAYMENTS HOWEVER I'M GREATLY CONCERNED SB TWO SIXTY SIX BROAD PROVISIONS COULD QUITE EASILY BE ABUSED AND BE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AND OF COURSE TAXPAYERS THIS BILL WILL INCREASE COSTS TO TAXPAYERS AS A FACT. IN A SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE. THE COST WILL COME IN THE FORM OF INCREASED EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO HANDLE THE INCREASED LIABILITY THE CALPERS WILL BE UNDER TO REVIEW COMPENSATION PROPOSALS. FROM MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS MEASURE SB TWO SIXTY SIX REPLACE 1100% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITY BURDEN FOR OVER PAYMENTS ON PUBLIC AGENCIES MANY OF WHOM SPEND OVER TWENTY THREE PERCENT. OF THEIR BUDGETS TODAY ON PENSION LIABILITY. AND IT DEMANDS A LOSS OF THE CALPERS HAS NO INCENTIVE TO EVEN PROPERLY CALCULATE. BENEFIT PAYMENTS WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH I COMMEND. MY FRIEND FROM CHINO FOR TRYING TO FIX A. PROBLEM BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO DO SO FOR THOSE REASONS ARGENEAU FOREIGN SB TWO SEVENTY TWO SIX SIX. THANK YOU CENTER STILL FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENTS. YOU KNOW AND WE DO WORK PRODUCT IN A CPA FIM YOU HAVE A PREPARE AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO REVIEWS THE WORK IN ITS PRE TYPE CHECK AND THEN IT GETS COMPLETED GOES TO A PARTNER FOR FINAL REVIEW AND- GOES OUT THE DOOR SO HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING IS BEEN. DOUBLE CHECKED BEFORE THE FINAL PRODUCT IS DELIVERED YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE EMBARRASSMENT OF A CLIENT COMING BACK SAYING YOU MADE A- MISTAKE. ON MY TAX RETURN OR MY FINANCIAL STATEMENT. SO YOU HAVE QUALITY CONTROLS. AND SO. I'M I'M WONDERING. IF PERHAPS THE ANSWER IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS INSIDE OUR- PENSION SYSTEMS BUT MAYBE. THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER LAYER AT THAT MAYBE WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT IF YOU DO MAKE A MISTAKE IF YOU FIND OUT LATER THAT THERE IS AN ERROR THAT. THE INSURANCE CARRIER WOULD PAY THE DIFFERENCE AND NOT HAVE A SURPRISE BUDGET EXPENSE. ON A MUNICIPALITY WHO IS IN PART OF THE QUALITY% CONTROL PROCESS OR MAYBE WE PUT THEM IN THAT PROCESS SO THAT THEY TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE CALCULATION OF THE BENEFITS. SO IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO WATCH THIS BILL I'VE BEEN LAYING OFF BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT THAT I SHOULD BE VOTING NO ON SB TWO SIX SIX THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY FOR DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE CENTER LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

YEAH HEY MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA RELATIVE TO THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT CENTER PAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS A ACR ONE FROM BY SOME MEMBER BONTA OPPOSES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY KNOWN AS PUBLIC CHARGE THAT TARGETS ARE VIABLE COMMUNITIES AND CAUSES HARDSHIP TO UNTOLD NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS TRYING TO REALIZE OUR OWN AMERICAN DREAM. ON OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY PROPOSED A NEW SET OF REGULATIONS REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE THE TERMINATIONS. IN AUGUST NINETEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN THE FARM HEALTH. DHS PUBLISHED ITS FINAL RULE REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE WHICH EXPERIENCE A LIST OF BENEFITS CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING WHO CAN CONSTITUTES EIGHT PUBLIC CHARGE. BEYOND CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDE HEALTHCARE HOUSING AND NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. PROGRAMS THAT HELP ALL PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES TO STAY HEALTHY WORK THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY. THE FINAL RULE ALSO CONSIDERS THE AGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN AND OVER SIXTY ONE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A NEGATIVE. THE ABSENCE OF KERN EMPLOYMENT OR LACK OF PROSPECT OF EMPLOYMENT THE USE OF PUBLIC BENEFITS L. ENGLISH PROFICIENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND INCOME LEVEL. SO QUITE LITERALLY IF YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. OR YOU'RE OLD ARE YOUR SICK ARE YOUR POOR ARE YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. IT WILL COUNT AGAINST YOU UNDER THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. THESE CHANGES HAVE REAL IMPACTS ACR ONE OBJECTS TO THE FINAL RULES RELATED TO PUBLIC CHARGE AND URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECONSIDER A ROLL BACK THESE CHANGES. CALIFORNIA IS STRONGER WHEN RESIDENTS IN NEED ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT SAFETY NET WITHOUT FEAR FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES OR THEIR FUTURES. OUR STATE SUCCESS HAS BEEN BUILT ON. IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE COME SOME OF WHO NEEDED A LITTLE HELP PERHAPS NOW THEN WE'VE ALL SUFFERED IN TIMES RECESSION AND OTHER ECONOMIC DISTRESS. AND MANY OF US ARE FAMILIES AT CERTAIN TIMES MIGHT HAVE NEEDED A LITTLE HELP FOR US TO. THEN GET BACK ON HER FEET AND THEN SUCCEED TO BECOME THE NEXT ENTREPRENEURS THE NEXT BUSINESS OWNERS THE NEXT GREAT EMPLOYEES THAT INVENTS ARE TREATING YOU PATENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. WHAT WE'RE NOW TELLING EVERYONE IS THAT YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT LITTLE BIT OF HELP BECAUSE IF YOU DO. YOU CANNOT STAY YOU ARE NOW YOU YOU DO NOT A FUTURE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS I THINK IS WRONG AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE. THANK YOU CENTER PAN MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. THE EXCESS OF THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IN EXISTING IMMIGRATION LAW IS GOING TO HAVE A DRAMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH ADVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. REPRESENTING A COUNTY WITH A PUBLIC HOSPITAL THIS IS GONNA AFFECT NOT ONLY ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES BUT ALSO MECHANISMS MAINTAINING THE BUDGET IN THE ECONOMY OF THAT HOSPITAL THERE ARE CITIZEN CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR NUTRITION ASSISTANCE WHO BECAUSE OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS ON FAMILIES. WILL NO LONGER SECURE WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AS POOR. US CITIZEN CHILDREN IT'S GONNA HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN AGRICULTURE IN HOSPITALITY TOURISM DO NOT EARN ENOUGH TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH THEY DEPEND ON NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT SUPPORT FOR THEIR CITIZEN CHILDREN. AND THE LINES ARE GETTING LONGER AND LONGER IT FOOD BANKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THIS IS A DRACONIAN MEASURE AND I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION THAT SEEKS TO PUT CALIFORNIA ON RECORD URGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECONSIDER. WHAT IS SET ILL CONCEIVED. EFFORT IN THEIR BROADER IMMIGRATION STRATEGY SO I URGE AN AYEVOTE.

SENATOR MOVES A CALL MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA MOVE BACK TO FILE ITEM FIFTY SIX SENATOR STERN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER AN ACT RELATING TO BUSINESS CENTERS STERN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE RESENT AB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT ON BEHALF ASSEMBLY MEN GALLAGHER PERSONALLY I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON AMENDMENTS BEFORE THE FLOOR THEY REMOVED ALL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THAT IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. YOU NEED PARENTAL CONSENT BEFORE STARTING A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT. NOW I KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IF YOU'RE TWELVE OR ELEVEN OR TEN. AND YOU'RE IN A DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE AT HOME AND YOU WANT TO GO ON THE INTERNET TO FIND. SOME COMMUNITY OR SOME PLACE THAT GIVES YOU SOME COMFORT FOR RESOURCES THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE BUT I DID WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. THAT RESOURCES LIKE THE TREVOR PROJECT WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR LGBT YOUTH CURRENTLY DOES HAVE A REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE THIRTEEN OR OVER TO UTILIZE THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA FRAMEWORK TO REACH OUT BUT I KNOW THERE ARE OPINIONS ON ON OTHER SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND I WELCOME THEM. BUT IN MY JUDGMENT I THINK IN IN THE JUDGMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION TWELVE. OR UNDER IS SIMPLY TOO YOUNG TO JUST GO ONLINE AND TRY TO FIND YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY PARENTAL OVERSIGHT. THERE ARE MANY DANGERS ON THE INTERNET WELL IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL TOOL WE THINK THAT THOSE MINERS OUGHT TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME PARENTAL CONSENT. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT. YOU CONSIDER STERN. NUMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ON HIGH I RISE RESPECTFULLY AND STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THIS LEGISLATION WILL CAUSE SEVERE HARM TO LGBT USE I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TRYING TO DO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THERE ARE NO BAD MOTIVES HERE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO PROTECT CHILDREN BECAUSE THERE ARE RISKS FOR CHILDREN TO GO ONLINE AT A YOUNG AGE SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT CASTING ASPERSIONS ON MOTIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON IS WHAT THE ACTUAL EFFECT OF THIS BILL. WILL BE. THIS BILL WILL HARM LGBT USE WHO ARE IN ABUSIVE HOMES WITH PARENTS WHO NOT ONLY DON'T SUPPORT THEM. BUT OUR AFFIRMATIVELY I'VE BEING INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE TOWARDS AND HARMING THEM AND ISOLATING THEM AND TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE WORTHLESS. THESE KIDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. OR QUICKLY CUT OFF FROM ANY HOPE OF UNDERSTANDING. THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THEM AND THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THEM IN THE WORLD THESE KIDS BECOME TRAPPED IN THEIR HOMES. THERE ARE MANY PARENTS WHO ARE WONDERFUL AND ACCEPTING AN AFFIRMING ABILITY TO YOU. BUT EVEN TODAY TWENTY NINETEEN THERE ARE SO MANY LGBT KIDS WHO WERE TRAPPED IN ABUSIVE HOMES. THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN MORE SOLATION OF THESE KIDS AND MORE HARM TO THESE KIDS. LGBT YOUTH ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. TOO MANY HAVE ON SUPPORT EVER ABUSIVE PARENTS THAT ARE HARMING THEM WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PARENTS WHO STILL SEND THEIR KIDS TO CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH AS WE KNOW IS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE IN FACT THIS LEGISLATURE BANDS CONVERSION THERAPY OR NEWS. THESE PARENTS ARE TELLING THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE WORTHLESS THAT THEY ARE SICK WITH THEIR BROKEN BUT THEY ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT. THE DAY ARE HUMAN REFUSE THAT'S WHAT THESE KIDS ARE HEARING FROM THESE PARENTS THIS IS THE REALITY THAT FAR TOO MANY LGBT YOUTH CONTINUE TO FACE IN THEIR OWN HOMES IT IS REAL. AN ALL TOO MANY OF THESE KIDS WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL IT IS NO BETTER THEY ARE GETTING BULLIED AND HARASSED. THEY HAVE ALL FAR TOO OFTEN TEACHERS AND STAFF WHO DON'T INTERVENE WHO DON'T HELP THEM AND MAY ACTUALLY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. HI THERE THE STATISTICS ARE ALARMING. 67% OF LGBT YOUTH REPORT THAT THEY HAVE HEARD FAMILY MEMBERS MAKE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT LGBT PEOPLE. LGBT YOU SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE AT ALMOST THREE TIMES THE RATE OF NINE LGBT YOUTH. LGBT YOUTH ARE ALMOST FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE COMPARED TO NINE LGBT YOUTH. LGBT YOUTH WHO COME FROM HIGHLY REJECTING FAMILIES ARE OVER EIGHT TIMES AS LIKELY TO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AS LGBT YOUTH WHO HAVE SUPPORTIVE FAMILIES. MORE THAN HALF OF TRANSGENDER MALE TEENS REPORT HAVING ATTEMPTED SUICIDE IN THEIR LIFETIME WELL 30% OF TRANSGENDER FEMALE TEENS REPORT THE SAME. AMONG NON BINARY USE POINT IN THEIR LIVES. SO WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS BILL. FOR MANY OF THESE YOU THE ONLY SUPPORT THAT THEY HAVE THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY HAVE CONNECTING WITH THEIR COMMUNITY. IS THROUGH THE INTERNET THAT IS A. THAT IS HOW BIG DEBTS SUPPORT IT'S HOW THEY CAN CONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THEM IT IS HOW HEY THEY CAN LEARN THAT IT GETS BETTER THAT IF THEY JUST HANG ON TO LIFE AND A SAYS STAYS STRONG AND PERSEVERE IT WILL GET BETTER FOR THEM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO SUPPORT THEM AND LOVE THEM AND FOSTER THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RISKS FOR CHILDREN ON THE INTERNET BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE CONVERSATION THAT THESE KIDS WILL BE HARMED BY THIS LEGISLATION AND I WILL BE VOTING NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SENATOR PORCHES. MADAM PRESIDENT. AS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG BOYS. SOMETIMES I FEEL OLD FASHIONED BY SAYING THIS BUT I AM SHOCKED AT WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. AND WHEN ONE OF MY BOYS YOU KNOW GETS A HOLD OF MY WIFE'S PHONE WHICH HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE CLEVER AND GET THE CODE TO ACCESS THE PHONE EVEN THOUGH CHANGES I THINK. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF SAFETY MEASURE PUT INTO PLACE AND I THINK THIS MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND I KNOW THAT MY FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO BRINGS UP SOME SOME GOOD POINTS ON CERTAIN COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THAT FIND THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH ARE HELPFUL TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT AS AS A WHOLE I THINK HAVING THE SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE I ULTIMATELY ALLOW THE PARENTS TO REGAIN SOME CONTROL NOT UNLIKE THE CODES THAT. I THINK IT'S HELPFUL IT'S NOT GONNA BE PERFECT MAYBE THEIR WAYS TO MAKE IT BETTER MOVING FORWARD BUT I'LL CERTAINLY BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS TODAY. SENATOR BOARD JUST SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS I AS I LISTEN TO US I REALIZE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SOUND AND MIKE THE. OLD PEOPLE THAT WE CLEARLY ARE. IN THAT WE ARE USING TERMINOLOGY INTERCHANGEABLY AND WE SHOULDN'T. THERE'S THE INTERNET AND THEN THERE SOCIAL MEDIA. TWO SEPARATE THINGS. SO YES OUR CHILDREN PICK UP OUR PHONES AND CAN SURF THE WEB AND SEE THINGS THAT'S TRUE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ADDRESSING. AND SO OUR QUESTION OF THE FOR JACKIE IF I MAY MATTER PRESIDENT. YEAH THERE ARE CERTAINLY TO THE QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED IF YOU COULD CLARIFY THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. IS LIMITING A MINER'S ACCESS TO ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE OR IS IT LIMITING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET NO IT WOULD STRICTLY BE LIMITED TO JUST ESTABLISHING A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT NOT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THANK YOU SO YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS EVEN WITH COMCAST IN THE PARENTAL CONTROLS ALL OF YOUR CHILDREN CAN NAVIGATE AROUND THAT TRUST ME. THEY ARE ALL SMARTER THAN WE ARE PERIOD THEY KNOW THE COLDS YOU PICK THEIR BIRTHDAYS YOUR OWN BIRTHDAYS YOUR HOUSE ADDRESS THEY KNOW IT. WE CAN NOT UNDER ESTIMATE THE POWER AND THE DANGER. OF. SOCIAL MEDIA EXPOSURE. THE I THINK A NUMBER OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ATTEMPTED TO SET UP. AGE RESTRICTIONS BEFORE IN ALL THE KIDS HAD TO DO WAS JUST A LIE ABOUT THEIR BIRTH YEAR IT REALLY WASN'T HARD. AND SO WE ARE FOR EVER PLAYING CATCH UP WITH TECHNOLOGY WE ARE PLAYING CATCH UP. AND WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP WITH ARE YOU THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. AND YET AND STILL WE CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA PARTICULARLY WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE VULNERABLE. AND THEY'RE REACHING OUT THROUGH THAT MEDIUM LOOKING FOR VALIDATION AND PEOPLE TO HEAR THEM. WE AS PARENTS IN THE ADULT IN THE WORLD SHOULD SHOULD FEEL SOME KINDA WAY THAT WE HAVE CREATED A SITUATION IN WHICH THAT'S THE ONLY OUTLET A YOUNG PERSON HANDS WHETHER WE SUPPORTER BELIEVE IN THEIR LIFE CHOICE AND NOT. GONNA THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION THAT THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GO TO. I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE POWER AND THE DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE POWER IN ITS ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH LIKE MINDED INDIVIDUALS FIND SUPPORT AND FIND THEIR OWN VOICE I REALLY STRUGGLE. I THINK HOWEVER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION TODAY THAT REFLECTS. WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL CHILDREN GIVEN. THE AGE RESTRICTION I GOES HERE THAT THERE IS A MATURITY LEVEL THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE. AND THAT WE AS ADULTS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT BRACES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THEM SOMETIMES FROM THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY REACH THE AGE OF MATURITY AND CAN HANDLE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. I THINK THAT WE AGAIN SHOULD REALLY BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT ROLE WE HAVE PLAYED AND WHAT LACK OF SUPPORTS PERHAPS WE ARE NOT MAKING AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL. IN THE HOME AND OTHER SETTINGS WHERE CHILDREN WHO ARE VULNERABLE ARE IN BAD SITUATIONS AT HOME HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO TO FOR SUPPORT THAT'S ON US AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO BETTER. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER DOLLY. THE BAND PRESENT MEMBERS I. THERE'S A ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT IS AS A PARENT SASANA SHARE A LITTLE BIT AS MANY YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWO SONS WHO ARE OLDER. NINETEEN AND SEVENTEEN AND THEN WE HAVE ROSLYN WHO IS NINE. WILL BE TEN NEXT MONTH. AND WE HAD A POLICY IN OUR HOME THAT NO CELLPHONES INTEL THIRTEEN. THAT WAS OUR POLICY WELL I HATE TO TELL YOU BUT RAZA HAS A PHONE. AND SHE'S NINE. SHE RUNS THE HOUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW. BUT WHAT IS READ THROUGH FOR ME I HAVE COMPASSION AND I HEARD MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMENTS. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A GOOD AT THEIR EXACTLY WHAT TO. THE SENATOR FROM EL áREA TALKED ABOUT IS THAT YOUR PARENTING IS A BIG PART OF THIS AND BEING PART OF YOUR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA FIND ALL KIND OF THE REASON WE CHOSE TO GIVE OUR DAUGHTER OF PHONE IS BECAUSE THE STUFF THAT SHE WAS SEEING ON OTHER PHONES AT SCHOOL. AND SO WE CAN HELP COMMUNICATE WITH HER AND ALSO MONITOR WHAT IS GOING ON THROUGH THE OTHER PHONE. ON FACEBOOK AND LIKES SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THERE MAY BE SOME AVENUES TO TIGHTEN THIS UP UNDER OTHER LEGISLATION BUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF HELP THIS THIS WILL HELP A LOT OF PARENTS AND GIVE THEM SOME TOOLS TO. HELP BE MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LEGEND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE WELL I AM AGAIN SYMPATHETIC TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S CONCERNS AND I CERTAINLY STIPULATE THERE ARE BAD PARENTS. BUT FOR MANY YEARS. GOVERNMENT AS INTERFERED WITH THE PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP. MADE IT HARDER. FOR PARENTS TO BE ENGAGED IN THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN. THEN CAME THE INTERNET INVADING OUR HOMES WITH MUCH GOOD. BUT ALSO SOME REALLY BAD. PARTICULARLY THE SEXUAL PREDATORS I PERFECTED THIS MEANS OF GROOMING VICTIMS. YOU READ ABOUT ALL THE TIME. AND IT WILL ONLY INCREASE. BY DOING THIS WE ARE TAKING AN ATTEMPT. DESTRUCTIVE THE FAMILIAL BOND. THE MOTHER. AND THE FATHER. A VERY YOUNG CHILD A VERY IMPRESSIONABLE CHILD. AND THOUGH THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES WITH. PERRANCE. I SUBMIT THAT THE BLOOD BOND. THE MOTHER AND FATHER. IS A SUPERIOR BOND TO ALL AND WE MUST PROTECT THAT BOND THIS BILL. IS A GOOD STEP IN THAT DIRECTION I REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I DO WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS WERE UP WITH THE GREAT CENTERED ON LOS ANGELES THAT DONNA WE DO KNOW THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS POWERFUL BUT THERE IT'S ALSO VERY VERY DANGEROUS AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IT IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY VALID POINTS HOWEVER. IT IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR CHILDREN AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU VERY BRIEFLY SOME A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS IN THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD THAT I COME FROM WE HAD A COMMUNITY OF ABOUT TEN KIDS SCHERING NAKED PHOTOS ALMOST NAKED PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT TOOK US A LITTLE WHILE TO CATCH ON TO IT. MY POINT BEING IS I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE DIGITAL FOOTPRINT TEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER I THINK AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE UNDERSTAND ONE PICTURE OUT THERE YOU'LL NEVER GET IT BACK AND STILL WIN FAIR EXPOSING THEMSELVES AT NINE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THEM THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW AS THEY'RE SEEKING A JOB THEY'RE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT AND NOW AS WE KNOW NOW MENTORS ARE ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND. THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE HIRING AND MANY HAVE BEEN DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I THINK THAT EVEN WHEN WE GO TO THIS THEATER YOU KNOW WE HAVE A AND P. G. THIRTEEN FOR RESENT OUT BECAUSE WE NEED PARENTS MONITORING THAT KIND OF CONTENT AND SETTLE AS MUCH AS I DO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO SPOKE OF. I THINK AT THIS TIME UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT OTHER SAFEGUARDS IT SIMPLE AND FOR US TO BE THE MONITORS. AND BIRDS OF OUR YOUTH AND SO WITH THAT. HI JUST WANTED TO SHARE NOT TO. SAY YES OR NO BUT REALLY JUST WANTED TO SHARE THE REAL THREATS TO OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU AND THIS IS BEEN A GREAT DISCUSSION AND I WOULD JUST SAY AS A PARENT OF THREE BOYS. EIGHTEEN TWELVE FOR WHO ARE ALL IN SOCIAL MEDIA WILL NOT ANSWER ME ON THE INTERNET. I WOULD CERTAINLY BE EXCITED TO WELCOME YOU KNOW MY- MY KIDS IN IN ENGAGING AND WEBSITES THAT ARE THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM BUT I KNOW THAT ALL PARENTS ARE NOT THE SAME. I'M ALSO VERY OPEN AND WELCOMING AS WELL SO I KNOW THAT IF MY CHILD HAPPEN TO BE L. G. B. T. I'D BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. BUT NOT A LOT OF PARENTS ARE LIKE ME. AND TO YOUR POINT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I TAKE THAT OF FULL YOU KNOW TO HEART. I ALSO KNOW THAT TERE'S YOUNG WOMEN OUT THERE THAT COULD ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL BE LIMITED A BECAUSE HE MAY BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT HOME AND THERE COULD BE A MULTITUDE OF VARIOUS ISSUES. SOME VERY. I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IF IT IS IMPLEMENTED AND I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. IS THAT IT WORKS WITH OUR- LGBT Q. CENTERS ARE SEXUAL ASSAULT CENTERS TO EDUCATE YOUNG ADULTS SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO ON THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA. ALSO HAVING WORKED AT MICROSOFT FOR MANY YEARS I ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN A LOT OF. WORK NOT JUST WITH PARENTS BUT WITH YOUNG STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE GETTING GETTING INTO IF THEY DID CREATE AN ACCOUNT. AND WE JUST DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF ALLOWING THESE. THESE YOUNG STUDENTS THESE YOUNG ADULTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT THAT THEY MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO ACT TO OPERATE. AND SO FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE IN SUPPORT. BUT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE WORK WITH THE CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW STUDENTS AND KIDS ARE USING THEM APPROPRIATELY. AND THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW GORE FOR GO FORWARD FROM THERE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ SENATOR DRAWS SO. I THINK WAT IS MOST TROUBLING TO ME IS THAT. WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT WHETHER TO PROTECT. THIS GROUP. OR THAT GROUP MEAN IT FEELS LIKE. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT THE CONVERSATION. WE ALL CARE ABOUT ALL THESE KIDS ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE. AND I FEEL AS IF WE'RE NOT EVEN CATCHING UP. THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE ALLOWING IT TO BE ON OUR DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA OR INTERNET WHICH I DON'T. TECHNICALLY UNDERSTAND. BUT WE GOT TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE MORE THAN WHICH IS MORE VALUABLE WHICH OF OUR KIDS WHICH ARE WE GOING TO PROTECT MORE THAN OTHERS THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AS A LAW AND THE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT THOSE WHO ARE THE TECHIES WHO DO UNDERSTAND THIS WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF NOT ALLOWING THIS TO BE. ANY KIND OF DANGER FOR ANY OF OUR KIDS FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS AND I CERTAINLY HOPE WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK WERE TAKING THESE MEASURES MUCH LIKE I FELT WHEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HOMELESS STUDENTS SHOULD PARK WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR CARS SHOULD PARK IN THE PARKING LOTS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM SO. I'M ALSO VERY TORN BUT I'M EVEN MORE TORN BECAUSE AN ANGRY THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT ON THIS LEVEL RATHER THAN ON THE TRUTH GET TO THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM LEVEL. THANK YOU SENATOR TO RUSSELL SENATE JACKSON IS A VERY BRIEFLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE POINT BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES. SO AS WE READ THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON NATIONALLY AS WE LEARN WHAT COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK. ARE DOING THEY ARE THE DRIVERS HERE. WE ARE TRYING TO REPAIR THE CONCERNS THE DAMAGE THE UNDERMINING OF WHAT WE THINK THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY BOTH LOOKS LIKE AN SHOULD LOOK LIKE SO I WOULD JUST URGE US ALL GOING FORWARD. WE ARE HERE. ACTING UP. A SYSTEM THAT IS IN GREAT NEED OF BEING REVIEWED. CHALLENGED BROUGHT NOT ONLY TO THE TABLE BUT BROUGHT TO ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH WE ARE STARTING TO SEE HAPPENING. EUROPE OF COURSE HAS. BEEN THE PENALIZE SOME OF THESE COMPANIES WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORTHCOMING THIS IS A MUCH LARGER DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IT'S IMPERATIVE BECAUSE THE INMATES ARE REALLY RUNNING THE ASYLUM AND WE NEED TO GET BACK. SOME CONTROL ON BEHALF F OUR COMMUNITIES AND AS YOU MENTIONED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THUNDERSTORMS BUT TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WHAT A THOUGHTFUL DEBATE. ON THIS ISSUE I THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR WEIGHING IN YOU KNOW I DON'T COME TO THIS BILL WITH THE PERSPECTIVE OF PARENT. BUT RATHER. YEAH HOPEFULLY SOMEDAY SOON. BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN MARRIED YET. BUT I COME IN IS IT IS SOMEBODY CAME OF AGE WITH FACEBOOK MY FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE WE HAD A BOOK WITH FACES IN IT THAT WE CIRCLED THE FACES AND LOOKED AT WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CLASS THAT DAY AND THEN SOPHOMORE YEAR. SO MANY MARK ZUCKERBERG CAME TO SCHOOL AND DECIDE TO PUT ALL THAT ON THE INTERNET. AND HERE WE ARE. A FEW YEARS LATER AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IS CHANGED. THE ENTIRE NATURE OF A OF WHAT A OF FRIENDSHIP NETWORK LOOKS LIKE IT'S CHANGED HOW WE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IS CHANGED. HOW WE SIT AT THE DINNER TABLE IS CHANGED HOW YOUNG PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER IN IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL IS CHANGING. AND THEY MAY SAY THAT. IT'S JUST A PLATFORM. BUT IT'S JUST TO A NEUTRAL PIPELINE OF INFORMATION. BUT I THINK TO THE CENTER FROM SANTA BARBARA. AND SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES IS POINT. IT'S TIME THAT THE TECH INDUSTRY TOOK AN EQUITY STAKE. IN THE EXTERNAL COSTS OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE UTILIZE THERE IS GREAT VALUE TO THESE PRODUCTS YES BUT THERE ARE GREAT COST AS WELL. SO I THINK IF YOU'RE SUPPORTING HIS BILL TODAY WHICH I CERTAINLY WILL BE. YOU'VE ALSO BOUND YOURSELF IN MY VIEW TO A COMMITMENT. TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY. TO OFFSET THESE EXTERNAL COSTS ON OUR YOUTH AND I THINK THAT. THE TECH INDUSTRY OUGHT TO BE TAKING A. EQUITY STAKE IN MORE LGBT CENTERS AND MORE ARE MORE RESOURCES FOR AT RISK YOUTH OF ALL GENDERS SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS RACES. BECAUSE IT'S HAVING AN IMPACT ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THAT GOES AS WELL FOR THE IMPACT ON JOURNALISM. AND OTHER EXTERNAL COSTS THIS IS NOT A NEUTRAL INDUSTRY THEY CAN BE LEADERS BUT IT'S TIME THAT WE PUT A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TOGETHER NOT JUST PROTECT PRIVACY. BUT TO ADDRESS THESE UNDERLYING EXTERNAL COSTS. THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS. YOU KNOW I RESPECTED THE FAMILY BOND IS CRITICAL AND THAT PARENTS I'M I'M BLESSED TO HAVE GROWN UP IN A HOME WHERE. I WAS LOOK LOVE PROBABLY TOO MUCH BUT BUT LOOKED AFTER AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO FIND IN THIS STATE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE FOR AND REAL NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT. BUT I YOU KNOW I WATCHED IN MY FAMILY MY TEENAGE SISTERS GO THROUGH SOME VERY HARD TIMES AND THE OUTLET THAT THEY FOUND. ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. BUT I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY REAL RISKS THAT EMERGED AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT- YOU HAVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL WHETHER. AT THE AGE OF TWELVE OR UNDER UTILIZING A RESOURCE. IS MORE PERILOUS THAN IT IS PRODUCTIVE. I THINK THAT PARENTS CAN'T BE RELIED ON SOLELY THAT WE NEED THESE EXTERNAL RESOURCES SO WHEN I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY I'M ASKING FOR A COMMITMENT INTO NEXT YEAR AND ESPECIALLY WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN THOSE OF US WHO DO WORK WITH THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY TO SAY WHAT IS IT LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY STEP UP AND COME TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY ACCOUNT FOR THE COSTS. THE EXTERNALITIES THEY'RE IMPOSING ON US AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. THANK YOU CENTER STERN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. ARCHULETA I ATKINS. BATES HI BILL NO.

LAURIE SITUATED CONTACTS. HE'S HOWEVER WILL STILL RETAIN PROTECTION TO THE DATA BREACH INCIDENTS IN THEIR RIGHT TO KNOW CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING COLLECTED BY A BUSINESS AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY ARE USED. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IS THE CONCERN THAT HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION COULD FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE FOR SPECIFIC.
