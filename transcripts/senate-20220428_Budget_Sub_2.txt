MCGUIRE STERN HERE'S STERN HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANNOUNCED THE HE ATTENDED. WE HAVE EVERYONE HERE OKAY WE HAVE FOUR FULL MEMBERSHIP- THIRD TWENTY NINE MEMBERS ON- A TWENTY NINE ISSUES ON THE- VOTE ONLY CALENDAR LET'S START OFF WITH ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY THIS IS A NEW BUDGET CONTROL SECTION TWENTY POINT- OH THREE APPROPRIATIONS AND- RE VERSIONS I DO WE WILL HAVE A PRESENTATION BY BY FINANCING THEM NATURALLY I'LL GO TO MY FRIENDS FDLE- SO MR OCULAR MISTER HALL. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS THIS IS AMBER ALL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM I'M HERE TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL THAT'S REALLY INTENDED TO STREAMLINE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL WORK LOAD THAT. DEPARTMENTS FINANCE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO CONSIDER EACH YEAR THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. I'LL GIVE A REALLY BRIEF OVER VIEW AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS MAY HAVE. I'M CONTROL SECTION TWENTY A FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED TO FOCUS ON A LIMITED SCOPE OF LANGUAGE ONLY ITEMS TYPICALLY RE APPROPRIATIONS AND REPARATIONS. TIME FOR SPECIFIED BONDED NON GOVERNMENTAL COSTS FUNDS. SO AS YOU KNOW EACH YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDES BOND TECHNICAL PROPOSALS. AND AS A COMPONENT OF THOSE WE INCLUDE AND EXTENSIONS OF LIQUIDATION AND REPRESENTS THIS LANGUAGES TECHNICAL IN NATURE- BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES A REALLY GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL. IN ORDER TO GET THAT INCLUDED INTO THE BUDGET ACT EACH YEAR- IN SOME CASES WE FIND TYPOS OR SOME SORT OF CLERICAL ERROR WHERE. WE SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER COME BACK WITH ANOTHER SPRING FINANCE LETTER. AND THEN MAKE I AM AMENDMENTS TO THE EXISTING BUDGET BILLS IN ORDER TO FIX THOSE. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN ALLEVIATE YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS TECHNICAL WORKLOAD FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. AND THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. I AM. AND STILL PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE JAIL B. C. NOTIFICATION PROCESS. HI I AM I'D SAY THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO JUST DE COUPLE SOME OF THESE LANGUAGE ONLY ITEMS FROM THE BUDGET BILL THEMSELVES. AND INSTEAD I AM CONSOLIDATE THESE ALL INTO ONE SPREADSHEET. THE JAIL BC COULD RUBIO AND IT WOULD ALSO PLACE THIS CRIME INTO ONE SPREADSHEET FOR SCO TO UPDATE ON THEIR RECORDS- RATHER THAN HAVING THE SORT OF LISTED THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET BILLS EACH YEAR AS WE DO CURRENTLY. AND TO BE CLEAR. WE WOULD STILL GO THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL BCP PROCESS FOR ANYTHING THAT REQUIRED A NEW APPROPRIATION. OR ANY INCREASES OR DECREASES TO- EXISTING DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATIONS AND THE BUDGET BILLS. AS WELL AS ANYTHING THAT INCLUDED I AM NEW POSITION REQUESTS. AND SO WE'RE REALLY VIEWING MESSES IS. TRYING TO SHIFT SOME OF THE REALLY TECHNICAL LANGUAGE ITEMS UNDER A NEW PROCESS THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY SAVE TIME FOR EVERYBODY. I'M WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT. ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE. MISS KRISTEN- WEYRICH SICK WITH THE L. L. I. K. I SEE THAT THE PRESENTATION FROM FINANCES THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE- MONEY PORTION OF A BOND FUNDED PROJECTS OR- A LEASE REVENUE FUNDED PROJECT I THINK THEY'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE. BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN IN IN. WITH EVERYBODY'S INTERESTED IN YOUR INPUT SO GOOD MORNING AND THAT. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I THINK HE'S SO MUCH CHEERING AND SENATORS MY NAME IS HELEN KIRSTY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO YEAH I TO CLARIFY THIS LANGUAGE BUT A FIVE FOR AND THINGS LIKE WE APPROPRIATIONS AND WERE VIRGINS OF THIS IS THIS IS- YOU. TYPICALLY FOR EXAMPLE- BONTA AND HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND OVER WHICH YOU HAVE TO SPEND THEM AND EITHER WAY THEY NEED TO BE RE APPROPRIATED AND- AND FOR EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BASICALLY ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO AND PHYSICALLY ADMINISTRATIVELY- EXTENDS THOSE THROUGH IT YOU KNOW PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WIT THE NOTIFICATION. RATHER THAN COMING BACK WITH A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY- FOR GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S OFTEN A CONSOLIDATED- TECHNICAL A PROPOSAL AND THAT PROVIDES ALL OF THOSE AND YOU SERVE A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS WE CONSIDERED AS PART OF A BUDGET TEAM PROPOSAL. AND THEN FOR THESE REVENUE BONDS TYPICALLY THERE ARE YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS THAT ARE THAT ARE PUT. FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATURE SO. WE NOW THEY'RE SEEN AS THE PEASY AND THEN THERE'S LANGUAGE INCLUDE IN. BY BILL AND SO I THINK EVEN. HAS BEEN- THE THAT DOES TAKE THE- TIME FOR THEM TO COMPILE. TIME AND THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TECHNICAL WORK ON ON THEIR END. WE THINK CERTAINLY THAT THE CONCEPT OF STREAMLINING THAT PROCESS AND NOT WORK AND YOU KNOW HAS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THERE IS WE DO RECOGNIZE THERE IS. SUBSTANTIAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN DOING THAT I'M AND THAT IN SOME CASES THESE REALLY ARE JUST TECHNICAL NON CONTROVERSIAL REVERBERATIONS EXTENSION BASICALLY OF ONE OF SPENDING. FORTY OR AUTHORIZATIONS RIVER FRIENDS I'M SPEAKING IN GENERAL THAT'S REASONABLE HOWEVER WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS- ISN'T PERHAPS THE MOST AND- THE MOST WELL SUITED TO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND IT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT'S VERY PUBLIC PROCESS AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT- FIGHT IS EASY FOR FOLKS TO AND MISTER SEA WHAT'S GOING ON AND SERVE OVERSEAS SO WE DO THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND- TO ONLY USE IT FOR THOSE TECHNICAL. AND NON CONTROVERSIAL ITEMS AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT LEGISLATORS COMFORTABLE WITH WITH THIS EXPANSION- AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENOUGH TIME AND INFORMATION. TO REALLY FACILITATE ITS REVIEWS SO WE HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS- BUT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER FROM MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE I HAVE. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS. THE FIRST THING IS THE LEGISLATURE READ SHOULD. WHETHER IT COMFORTABLE. HAVING THIS LIKE A FIVE TO OF THE REFER THE BONDS IN AND THESE ARE ABOUT THE THAT THE NAME. THIS IS FOR HER- TO AND I ACTUALLY NOT OF YOUR MIND AND MANY. ANYWHERE DID YOU BUY AND ALL THESE REVENUE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENTLY FROM TO YOU- SO WE WORK LET'S JUST CAN WHETHER COME WITH APPROACH. OR WOULD LIKE TO WOMEN FOR A- WE KNOW THEY'RE BEING. STATE KINDS RELATED TO PRISON CRISIS- IN A PATH- AND- THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IT RICH REGARD TO PRISONS- AND THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE PRESENTS SO THAT'S BEEN AN AREA WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE. HAS HAS- HE HAD A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN TO. IN ADDITIONAL. OF THAT'S THE CASE ON THE CASE OF PROJECTS BE X. FROM. PROCESS IF WORKS AN THE WISH OF THE LEISURE. UNDER OTHER WAY FOR VERY LARGE- FINE APPROPRIATIONS COULD BE EXCLUDED RECEIVED. REPORTS THERE AT COULD BE TO THEIR- DAY OPTIONS THERE BUT WE DO WANNA MAKE SURE. LEGISLATURES REALLY- HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT RIGHT OR ARE WHETHER THERE'S CASES. THAT IT'S NOT WITH. THE SECOND- RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. THE TINY AND WHETHER WANTS TO PROVIDE ANY LIMIT TO ON MANY NOTICES INCOME FOR. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT SOME HAPPEN IS. ON THE LEGISLATURE BOTH MEMBERS AND STAFF AND GET A LIFE GET REQUESTS RIGHT AT THE END OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND THINGS ARE SO BUSY THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT AND WITH THE OTHER COMPETING WORK LED TO DO THAT DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE IDEAL. ON SOME OF THESE THINGS AND SO ONE THING AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS WHETHER IT WANTS TO REQUIRE THAT THESE. NOTIFICATIONS COME FORWARD BEFORE MAY FIRST AND THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BEFORE THE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO REVIEW THEM. AND FINALLY- WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER IT WANTS TO REQUIRE AS PART OF THE LANGUAGE- ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION BE REQUIRED SO WE- WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND- HAS IT HAS EXPRESSED ITS INTENT TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION IN A SPREADSHEET ON THE THREE CORPORATIONS MAKING THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE. BUT WE THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO MEMORIALIZE THAT IN AND IN LANGUAGE- AS PART OF THE CONTROL SECTION THAT WAY YOU KNOW AS- AND- TIME MOVES FORWARD DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE IN POSITIONS- YOU KNOW THINGS CHANGE- WELL I'LL BE CLEAR. ON WHAT'S EXPECTED AS PART OF THESE NOTIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY GET THE INFORMATION THAT IT NEEDS TO MAKE. MAKE SURE YOU THOSE- REQUESTING THAT THEY REALLY BEGAN OUR TECHNICAL- AND. AND ARE NOT CONTROVERSIAL. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY PART. FORGET THIS MISTER HALL MISS US YEAR TROW. GREEN HE GOT JOINT BUDGETCOMMITTEE. RATHER THAN THIS COMMITTEE SO WE- WITH SORT OF A DEGREE. WHAT THE EXTENSIONS. ON WOULD BE- AS- BEEN IN THIS IDEA THE MAIN. I CAN AND- IF KNOW THE TECH LANGUAGE IS OFF SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW ON THE MONEY IF YOU GET A NEED TO REVERSE AND THEY THEY'RE IT'S SORT OF CLOSE. AT I RECALL AS WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR WE GET TO. JUNE AND THEY THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE CLOSE OUT THE BIGGEST THING ONE EXTENSION. JUST AS THE FINISH UP STUFF. YOU GUYS HAVE A COMMENT ON THE ALEJO'S- SUGGESTED RECOMMENDATIONS. ONCE YOU. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE WITH THIS PROCESS I'M AND YOU KNOW THE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF- INFORMATION AND SO. TO BE CLEAR RIGHT NOW WE START WITH A VERY BROAD AND DETAILED BOND SPREAD SHEET WHERE WE WORK WITH OUR BOND COORDINATORS AND DEPARTMENTS EACH YEAR. AND THAT'S SORT OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ALREADY CONSOLIDATED DOWN. IT'S USUALLY INCLUDED AS BACK UP UPON YOUR REQUEST I AM FOR THESE ISSUES. AND SO UNDER THIS PROCESS WE WOULD BASICALLY TAKE THAT EXACT SAME LEVEL OF INFORMATION. ACTUALLY I THINK IN THIS CASE IT MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDING A FEW I AM COLUMNS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ESTIMATED RE APPROPRIATIONS. I'M AND THAT WOULD JUST GO THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS SO. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THERE TO BE A PERCEPTION THAT WORD PROVIDING LESS INFORMATION OR THAT WE'RE BEING LESS TRANSPARENT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT ALL. I'M AND- YOUR POINT YES THAT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY AS HELPFUL THAT. REALLY AS WE GET NEARER TOWARDS THE END OF SOME OF THESE OLDER BONDS I AM THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE YOU KNOW. BECOMES A SMALL ENOUGH AMOUNT WHERE SOMETHING- AS SIMPLE AS EMPLOYEE COMPOUND RETIREMENT ADJUSTMENTS THAT HIT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. CAN ACTUALLY SQUEEZE SOME OF YOUR OUTER YEARS TO THE POINT WHERE WE MIGHT NEED TO REVERT UP TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW A CERTAIN PART OF THAT WAS NOT. OVER ALLOCATED. AND SO WE REALLY DO LOVE AT THE IS A SOME OF. THEM SOME OF THE MOST TECHNICAL ISSUES ON THEIR- I DON'T THINK WE REALLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE TIMING NECESSARILY I THINK IT'S IN OUR INTEREST AS WELL TOO I AM. TO GET THESE AND YOU KNOW FOR GLBT RUBIO AND ALSO TO GET THEM AND- FOR SCO TO UPDATES- THE HEAD OF THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE- MY UNDERSTANDING IS A LOT OF TIMES EXTENDED REVERTED AFTER THAT LAST YEAR WAS DONE. SETTING UP SOME OF THE NEW ITEMS OF APPROPRIATION AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY HOPING THAT. IF WE CAN GET THESE THROUGH A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY- ALLEVIATE THAT ISSUE AS WELL. MAKES SENSE- MAKE SURE YOU ANY ADDITIONAL NOTES YOU HAVE SHARE WITH US. THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS HERE IN. ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY WITH THE NEW BUDGET CONTROL SECTION. TWENTY POINT HELLO. PART STEP- CENTER DOLLY I JUST WANNA GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT- I'M NOT OPPOSED TO DOING YOUR TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATION POINTED OUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR NINE THOUSAND BUT WORK TOWARDS THIS IS A THIS IS A BIG POLICY. CHANGE AND THIS IS THIS COULD YOU I THINK I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THE I. ONE OF THE- MEMBERS TO KNOW I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF ALLOWING JUST A CAR BLANK THERE IS REALLY NO. LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME TOGETHER IT'S THE BIG THREE THAT DECIDE THESE THINGS MISTER SPEAKER THE PROTEGER A MINUTE MINISTRATION AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAPPENED SO I WHEN I WAS GOING ON RECORD SAYING THE DAILY- BRINGS UP SOME. CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR JOB AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT THESE BONDS- ARE JUST SHIFTED AROUND AND SO. IT'S GOING ON RECORD SAYING THAT LOOK AT US WE SHOULD SET A DOLLAR AMOUNT. AND THEN MAYBE MOVE FORWARD BUT NOT JUST GIVING- MORE POWER TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO JUST MOVE THESE BONDS AROUND HOWEVER THEY WANT. OKAY SEE THE- THE QUESTIONS WERE THIS WITH THIS MATTER WILL BE. HOLD OPEN AS WE GO THROUGH BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND APPRECIATE THEIR INPUT LET'S MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION- THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY ONE IT'S THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL FIRE AND LIFE. SAFETY DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL PROGRAM AND THIS WE HAVE WITH US FROM CAL FIRE- WINDY COLLINS TO SEE ASSISTANT STATE FIRE MARSHAL- THIS IS YOUR PROPOSAL FOR THREE POINT TWO MILLION REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY. TO INCREASE IT- TWO POINT EIGHT OR TO GO TO TWO POINT EIGHT AND TWELVE POSITIONS I'M GOING WITH THE OFFICE THE FIRE MARSHAL WELCOME GOOD MORNING. MORNING THANK YOU SOME TERRY AND COMMITTEE- AGAIN MY NAME IS WENDY COLLINS ON THE ASSISTANT STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. EXPRESS ANY CLARIFICATION TO OUR NEEDS OUR CLASS TO ADD THOSE TWELVE ADDITIONAL COUNTERPARTS ABOUT. TO THE FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE OVERSIGHT OF AN EXISTING MO YOU WITH THE INDIVIDUAL UC CAMPUSES- LMAO PRODUCT YOU KNOW WHY THIS WHY NOW KIND OF QUESTION- WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLY SO- UNDERSTANDABLE SO HISTORICALLY THE ANIMAL YOU. DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY TO THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. OF THE STATE FARM ACTUALLY EACH CAMPUS WAS ISSUED A LARGE PART THE PREVIOUS DEPUTIES OF THE STATE FARM MARSHALL'S OFFICE WHO WENT TO THE UC SYSTEM EITHER BY CHOICE OR BY LAYOFFS THE OPPOSITE SEX ARMOR. THAT'S STOP WAS OVER IN THE IN. ROLES AT THE L. S. OFFENSE AND HAD PART CODES. PROCESS THERE FOR REALLY HAVING THAT DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE WISE AND WHAT FORMS OF THE CODES OF FALL WITHIN THE CHURCH. OF THE LS. ADDITIONAL DO TO FROM. RIGHT THEY CAPPING. WITH THE- OS OFFENSE. AND FREQUENTLY OUT TO THIS THE ISSUE SEVEN. H. WAY BUT THE DISCLAIMER FOR THIS I ONE TO NOTE OUT OF CAUTION DUE TO CIVIL TO DISCUSS SPECIFICS WOULD LIKE-OFFER A HIGH LEVEL. OF AND INCIDENT REGARDING A DOESN'T MAKE THE CAMPUS FARMER REACHING OUT OUR OFFICE TO REPORT THAT THEY WILL BE. WITHIN A WEEK OF RETIREMENT WE HAD REACHED NO NOT THEIR- CAMPUS MARSHAL. AND WITH THE LAW CANNOT AND MY TO TAKE OVER WORK. DILLARD AT THE UC OFFICE THE PRESS WHO HAS BEEN HAD BEEN ACTING AS OUR GO BETWEEN FOUR. EIGHT RESPONSES BETWEEN THE CAMPUS THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. MUCH LIKE ANY DOLLAR OF AUTHORITY WITHOUT SOMEONE WORK WITHIN THAT THE ONLY. OR THAT DELEGATES IS SENDING THE AUTHORITY. BACK TO THE AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ENFORCEMENT. I WAS A FAN STAFF WAS REASSIGNED TO CAMPUS TO WORK FROM CURRENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. ARMY AMBULANCE. MANY DIFFERENT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR TO FIRE LIFE SAFETY INSPECTIONS INSPECTION AND SPECIFICALLY A BREACH OF THE MO Q. REGARDING CONTRACTING- OF SERVICES OUT OF THAT DELEGATE. OUR STAFF QUICKLY WITH THE UC OF THE AND OF SOUTH TO PICK THAT UP BY. THAT WOULD MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS- THAT ARE EQUIVALENT TO THE DEBIT TO A DEPUTY STATE FIRE MARSHAL THE SPECIALIST CLASSIFICATION. CANDIDATE WAS CHOSEN BY THE UNIVERSITY AND THE- SEVERAL MORE CLOSELY TO TRAIN AND BRING THAT CANDIDATE UP TO SPEED. ON CURRENT CAMPUS PROJECTS IN THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS- THAT HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE BY OUR STAFF. AS THE ISSUE CAME TO LIGHT. THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELEGATION WAS REALLY EXPLORED- BEING THE AUTHORITY TASKED WITH THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY. SUPERMARKET WAS QUITE CONCERNED AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS REQUEST- BY WAY OF US BEING FINANCE LETTER. THERE'S BEEN SIX A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AN ATTRITION IN THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL PROGRAM WHRE MUCH OF THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND CONNECTIONS WITH THE- SFM HAVEN'T LOST. YOSEF M. IS ONLY AWARE OF THE TWENTY EIGHT DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRING MY SAFETY ASPECTS ON ALL PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY THE UC'S- THE WORKLOAD SEEMS DISPROPORTIONATE TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN THE MINIMUM STANDARD THAT ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES. TO NOTE THAT DOESN'T A CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES M. WE ALSO OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER DUTIES HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THEM THROUGH THEIR CAMPUS CHAIN OF COMMAND. ANNUALLY WE DO RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT CONSIST OF THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TITLE NINETEEN ENTITLED FOR INSPECTIONS- IF WE USE IT AS A GOOD STEWARDSHIP- IT WOULD. IT WOULD DICTATE THAT WE REVIEWED THOSE LESSER COMPLETED INSPECTIONS AND PERFORM SPOT CHECKS- ON THE COOK COMPLAINTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OR EVEN FOLLOW UP ON DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE- IDENTIFIED BY THOSE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIREWATCH. HOWEVER WITHOUT THIS REQUEST WE REMAIN STAFFED EFFICIENT TO PERFORM THIS OVERSIGHT LEAVING FACULTY STAFF STUDENTS AND THE FACILITIES WITH AN UNKNOWN DEGREE OF FIRE AND MIGHT SEEK TO PUT. MUCH LIKE ANY DELEGATION WHETHER IT IS A STATE FIRE MARSHAL. PERSONALLY DELEGATING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU HERE ON HIS BEHALF TO PAY MORE THAN APARTMENT HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION FORMERLY- ASHKHABAD DELEGATING AND THEY'RE THIRTY TO THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS TO MONITOR THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND- RENOVATION SEISMIC SAFETY OF THOSE HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IT ALSO MEANT RESPONSIBILITY RESPONSIBLE PARTY IS CHEAP RICH WINE OR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION JUST AS SOME COMPARISONS- MY STAFF THAT ONE OF MY GO TO STATEMENTS IS IT OKAY TO BE WRONG IT'S PART OF HEAD OF STATE RUN. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE STAFFING TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE EXISTING PMR VIEW BUT NOW THAT SOME OF THOSE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. WE CAN NO LONGER PROCEED WITHOUT NO OVERSIGHT COMPONENT. WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO RESET THAT OVERSIGHT AND- SOME OF THAT THAT MO YOU AND IT'S IN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE ALEJO. THAT THEIR- IDEA WAS THAT THIS WAS A DUPLICATE OF PROGRAM. IT IS NOT DEPRESSED DUPLICATE IT IS SIMPLY AN OVERSIGHT PROGRAM- THAT IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE AUTHORITY DELEGATED- TO THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AND THEN FORWARDED ON TO THE UC CAMPUS- I AM AVAILABLE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU UNDERSTAND CURRENTLY THERE ARE ELEVEN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT DESIGNATED INS MORE. MARSHALS THAT ARE WORKING AT THE UC THAT ARE DOING THE WORK. AT UC MERCED UC RIVERSIDE IS TO IS THAT CORRECT. HELLO THERE'S TEN YOU SEE I GOT TEN UC CAMPUSES FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS AND ONE NATIONAL LABORATORY- ALL BEING CONDUCTED AND THOSE ARE STATE WHETHER THEIR OWN PROPERTIES OR WHETHER THEY ARE LEASED PROPERTIES. THOSE ARE BEING INSPECTED BY TWENTY EIGHT DESIGNATED CAMPUS FOR MARCIA SO IN THE PROPOSAL IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TWELVE ADDITIONAL. MARSHALL'S STEP WITH TO REVIEW OF THE- REPORTS THAT THEY DO SPOT INSPECTIONS AND. SO THE RECORD IS ACTUALLY FOR SIX THAT'S A GATED CAMPUS FARMERS- I'M SORRY SIX FIREWORKS WERE FOR OUR OFFICE AND- ONCE STAFF FOR OUR H. R. COMPONENT. ONCE SUPPORT STAFF FOR OUR I. T. DEPARTMENT AND THE OTHER STAFF WOULD BE- OF THE GPA AS A LEVEL THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO- DO A LOT OF THAT THAT. REVIEW AND ANALYSIS- FROM OUR DEPUTIES THAT ARE IN THE FIELDS. AND ON THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY THE L. YOUR GONNA GET TO MISS CARSON THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT THESE FOLKS NEED TO DO THEIR JOB IS IDENTICAL. SO THE WHEN WE MADE THE L. THE MO YOU TO START WITH WHAT WE USED TO WAS THE- SAME HIRING MINIMUM WORK QUALIFICATIONS. AS ONE OF OUR DEPUTIES THE RESPECT FOR- AND THAT IS JUST TO MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO TAKE THE EXAM TO BECOME- DEPUTY STATE FIRE MARSHAL. SO THOSE ARE THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR OUR STAFF WE CONTINUE TO DO- APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING THROUGHOUT AND- CAN NEW CONSTRUCTION TRAINING- DIFFERENCE TECHNOLOGIES- THAT ARE COMING ON SO WE DO ADDITIONAL TRAINING WITH OUR DEPUTIES THE FARMER. OKAY MISS CURSING WITH THE L. A. O. HE FELT THE BENEFIT AT THIS PRESENTATION WHICH IS ADDED SOME MORE. INFORMATION IF YOU'RE YOU'RE RECOMMENDATION IS WAS INSUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I CHAIR AND SENATORS SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE FIND THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL HASN'T ADEQUATELY JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR THE REQUESTING UNIT AND IT'S THIS EXACTLY WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED SPECIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT YOU SEE CURRENTLY FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ENFORCE BUILDING STANDARDS AT ITS CAMPUSES AND WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW ABOUT. ONCE CAN'T THIS POTENTIALLY THAT MAY HAVE HAVE HAD AN ISSUE- WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION YET- ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT ISSUE IS AND ALSO JUST HOW WIDESPREAD THAT IS SO IS THAT REALLY JUST RELATED TO THIS ONE CAMPUS THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT BUILDING. PROGRAM AND HAD SOMEONE RETIREES IS A MORE WIDESPREAD ISSUE AND SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR A TAD- WHETHER A NEW DEDICATED UNIT AS IS PROPOSED IS REALLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. THE ISSUES IF ANY- BETTER IF THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT YOU SEE- YES YES HI DELEGATED AUTHORITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO WHILE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY UNDERPINNING THIS IMHO YOU IT'S FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TEN OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU SEE IS HAD THIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. SO IT'S BEEN ALMOST THIRTY YEARS THAT YOU SEE IS HAD THIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO DO THESE- INSPECTIONS AT THEIR CAMPUSES. SO- IT IS IT'S ON THAT WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT. IT A REALLY. SORT OF THE SECOND LAYER ISN'T IT IS THE APPROACH MIGHT BE- BUT THERE COULD BE A THINGS COULD BE CAN. I SO YOU KNOW WE ALSO. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU OUR REVIEW CAME UP AS WE DID TALK TO YOU SEE- AND HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU SEE AND THEY RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW. IN THEIR MINDS IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL IT BUT IT WAS WARRANTED IS WHAT WE HEARD IN ME WE HEARD THAT THEIR CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS DUPLICATIVE. I'M AND IT WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES ON THEIR PART TO STUDENTS TODAY TO- BE INVOLVED IN IN THIS SORT OF. PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE THIS EXTRA LAYER FOR THEM SO THAT THAT WAS WHAT WE HEARD FROM THEM. AGAIN WE DON'T YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW AND SO FAR RIGHT THE RATIONALE FOR URBAN REJECTING AT THIS TIME IS TO GIVE EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THINK ISRAEL WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN APRIL THE END OF APRIL. ALMOST MAY- YOU KNOW AS THE COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS THIS THE END OF THIS PROCESS GOES SO QUICKLY- AND SO WE THINK THAT IF THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO COME BACK IN JANUARY THAT WOULD GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL AN- ADDITIONAL RATIONALE. IT'LL ALSO GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK WITH YOU SEE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CONCERNS THAT THEY RAISED ARE MERITORIOUS- WERE NOT. INTENDED TO REALLY HOPEFULLY COME TO A CONSENSUS THIS ISSUE. I'M SO- HAVE YOU TAKEN BY. MISTER BENSON PART FINANCE CHIEF ANYTHING YOU WOULD TO ADD. THANK YOU SURE ASSUME. HARBOR IF I. HIS RESPONSE. ONE POINT OUT THAT HELP FIGHT. HOW WHITES THE PROBLEMS THAT. YOU IN THAT DENTISTS LIKE. IS SHE SAID YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY JUST. IS THE A FEW. OKAY TO BE WRONG IT'S THE NOT OKAY CONTINUE BEING WRONG THINK WHICH IS NOW. IN HIS THAT. NO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BACK TO. LOW OR SAY THEY SHOULD AND AS THEY HAD STEP IN AND- THE CAMP THAT YOU'RE- TO THE DISCOVERED SOMETHING. AND WITHOUT THE IMPROPER LEVEL OF OVER. TO GO INTO AND DO. CHECKS AND- WE MAY NOT KNOW. HOW PRO SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE THERE NEEDS TO BE CORPORATE. ELSE'S WAY TO REITERATE THAT THIS. DOESN'T CREATE ANY REDUNDANT. THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FARMERS. WILL CONTINUE TO DO ALL OF THE PLAN REVIEW. PHILIPPINES SECTION TO. BUILDINGS FOR. ON THERE CAN THE- OBJECTIVE. OR TO REVIEW NEW SPOT CHECKS. ANNUAL CHECK INS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FIREMEN. BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS- BE MET. HOW WE FEEL THAT GIVE THE SIX. PUBLIC AND HOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS WITH THE STUDENTS AND STAFF AND FACULTY THAT THAT UC'S CAMPUSES BUT THIS LEVEL OVER SCIENCE CORPORATION. TIME WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PLACES ANY UNDUE BURDEN ON THE UC CAMPUS STATE FARM PERSONAL BILLS AND HOURLY RATE. THIS WILL ONLY BE BILLED FOR THE COST OF THE HOURS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PERFORM APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AT THEIR CAMPUSES SO OF CODE COMPLIANCE IS BEING DONE APPROPRIATELY THAT WILL BE A VERY MODEST IN NORMAL AMOUNT OF. TIME IN THERE FOR A VERY MODEST YOU KNOW A LOT OF COST THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT COST AS IF THE FAUCET FARMERS DISCOVERED THAT THINGS ARE NOT BEING. SO WE RESPECTFULLY. THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER APPROVING THIS REQUEST TODAY OR AT LEAST HOLDING IT OPEN SO WE CAN CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR SO- AND- ADDRESS THE ISSUE HAS OTHER ISSUES TO CLOSE OUT THIS. WEBSITE THANK YOU SEND REQUIRED QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT. I'M MORE OF A COMMON IF IT'S ALREADY- MISS CHAIRS SO LOW FOR SOME US I THINK THAT WE CAN AGREE THAT THE STATE FARM MARSHAL'S. PROVIDES CRITICAL SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE THAT KEEPS CALIFORNIANS SAFE KEEPS OUR STATE AGENCIES- ACCOUNTABLE MAKING SURE THAT THEIR MEETING PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS. SINCE THE TWO THOUSANDS THE OFFICE HAS BEEN TASKED TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES BASED ON FEES AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE TODAY. BUT IT IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY AND THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGES WITH APPROACHING THIS WITH A FEE BASED STRATEGY. AND IT IS LEAD TO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SMALL FAIRS AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A SOLUTION COULD BE. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE SEE WITH THE STATE FARM MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH IS STATE FARM MARSHAL'S OFFICE FOR ENGAGING ON THIS ISSUE. SMALL FAIRS ACROSS THE STATE FACE HIGH FEES FROM THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL FOR EVENTS. THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE BEER SUPPORT THEMSELVES AFTER THE STATE STOP SUPPORTING FARES. ANY CURRENT INSPECTION RATE FROM THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE IS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. THE FIRE MARSHAL IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A REVISED FRAMEWORK AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TRULY THIS IS NOT THROWING STONES AT THE FARMERS CHAU OR SAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS THAT WOULD REQUIRE AN EIGHT HOUR EIGHT HOUR PARTY WITH FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE TRINITY COUNTY FAIR. WITH LESS THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT OUR PARTY WITH FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE YOU'RE SPENDING FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THE COST OF THE FIRE MARSHAL. FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW WE HAVE A GREAT IDEA WHY DON'T WE SAT IN THE UC SYSTEM WITH THE SAME STRATEGY SO THIS CREATES A DISINCENTIVE CANDIDLY FOR SMALL STATE AGENCIES OR LARGE STATE AGENCIES- TO BE ABLE TO ABIDE BY  T BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GONNA BY BY STATE LAW NO ONE'S GONNA BOOK THEIR BOOK THEIR HOLES THERE ARE GONNA BOOK THE HOLES BEFORE BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO THE PRICE OF THE HALL THERE'S BEEN AN FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COVER THE COST OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. ALL THEY SAID IS IT IS FINALLY IS THAT WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM A FEE BASED FUNDING- ST STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE OFFICE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WE'VE DONE THIS FOR OVER A DECADE NOW IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S ANTIQUATED IN ITS PUNITIVE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT NGUYEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BRINGS BACK- OVERALL STRATEGY IT'S INVESTING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AS WE SHOULD BE INTO THE STATE FARM MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SECURE FROM THE INTELLIGENCE. CENTER DOLLY. TWELVE LOVE HAVEN'T CENTER FROM THE SEC DISTRICT ON COULD YOU EVER RULE THIS IS THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW WE SHOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHAL. UNDERNEATH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND DO THOSE INSPECTIONS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN TRAVEL IN SOME CASES. A HALF A DAY TO GET TO THE SITE EVEN WHICH A CHARGE FOR SO I THINK WE SHOULD I THINK OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL SHOULD ALLOW THE LOCALS TO. HAVE THEIR LOCAL FIRE MARSHAL THE CERTIFY THEM. THANK YOU ALL SEEING THE WEATHER QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS SEE SEPARATE RENDITION IS TO REJECT THIS. CALL BACK. AND CONTINUED COP CONVERSATIONS SERVE YOU GOT SOME FEEDBACK FROM- THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THAT. VERY GOOD LET'S MOVE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WAS MOVED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY TWO IS A STATE WIDE BUDGET- PACKAGE IN STUDIES. AND WE HAVE A MISTER DO WE USE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. AS WELL AS- OUR FRIENDS AT FINANCING ALLEY ON. FIVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WE GOOD MORNING.

DEVELOP FURTHER WITH THIS FUNDING WE EXPECT THE PROJECT TO BE HEAVILY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS INCLUDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ACCESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CODE COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL IMPROEMENTS. IMPORTANT NOTE THAT CAPABLY PROJECTS ARE ESSENTIAL OF THE DRESSING THE- DIVERS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND COMMONLY INCLUDE OTHER PROJECT CATEGORIES SUCH AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ELEMENTS AS WELL AS EXPANDED OR IMPROVED FACILITIES. TO REFLECT CHANGING VISITATION PATTERNS AND USER NEEDS. THE PROPOSED FUNDS WILL BE USED TO CONDUCT DETAILED STUDIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING GEOTECHNICAL STUDIES NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCE INVENTORIES. AND THESE EFFORTS WILL ALSO HELP INFORM PRIMARY DESIGN CONCEPTS UNIT TO DEVELOP DETAILED COST ESTIMATES INSCRIPTIONS THAT WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION. BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPEDITE THE LENGTHY PERMITTING PROCESS RESULTING IN SHORTER PROJECT DELIVERY SCHEDULES BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO ENGAGE PERMITTED AGENCIES EARLIER IN IN THE PROCESS. AND WOULD THAT THIS CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND I HAD THE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. KRISTIN YOUR THOUGHTS CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL WE JUST KNOW THAT SEEKS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKES IT COULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER PROVIDING THAT DIRECTIONS THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED FOR THOSE PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND THEN LIKELY LEGISLATURE WILL SEE THOSE PROJECTS COME FORWARD SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AND I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAS TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT SOME OF ITS PRIORITIES- WITH REGARD TO PARTS INFRASTRUCTURE SO AND IT'S JUST LIKE THAT FOR YOU BUT BUT NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SEND THE MONEY.

EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDES MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- TO THE PARKS AND I'LL LET YOU GUYS. OPEN UP YOUR EMAIL AND READ DAT. AS IN WE'RE IN THERE ARE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE. MILLION DEBT THAT WAS IS DEDICATED FOR THE BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WE HAVE SO WHAT WE THINK IT'S- THIS PROPOSAL IS GOOD THIRTY THIRD LOOK AT EVERYTHING- IN IN. TOTALITY AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WERE YOU HAVE- YOU KNOW- CLIMATE IMPACTS ON ON THE PARKS DO YOU HAVE ANY- STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS UP AND HAVE ANY. THING ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON- SENATORS AND- MY NAME IS THE STOCK NUMBER THAT I KNOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENTS ON THE SENATE PROPOSAL AT THIS AT THIS TIME. ALL I KNOW THAT I YET JUST SAYING WE'RE GOING TO YOU'LL BE BACK HERE YOU'LL BE BACK HERE FINANCE IN THE COMING YEARS AND WILL HAVE A SPECIAL HEARING ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL I'M JUST GIVING YOU A HEADS UP RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS RATHER MODEST AND IT'S WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN- WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT. CATEGORIES DEPUTY DIRECTOR DR DO WE BUT I I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT YOU'VE HEARD THEM BEFORE HI THERE YOU KNOW- IT'S A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS DEATH- BACKLOG AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WE PUT A CHUNK IN LAST YEAR. AND I GUESS TO BE NOT SO ELOQUENT WITH LIKE ANOTHER CHUNK FOR THE NEXT. COUPLE OF YEARS SO TO LOOK AT IT. C. NO. THE QUESTION WILL GET A WHOLE THIS MATTER OPEN THANK GUYS FOR- THE FOR THE INPUT AND WILL MOVE TO. A ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY THREE THIS IS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AS WELL AS WE HAVE A CALTRANS WHO'S AVAILABLE- THIS IS- THE WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY ACTIONS. COMPENSATORY MITIGATION CRITICISES SPRANG OUT OF- SB SEVEN NINE OH WITH SENATOR STERN AND CORTICES- THE DIRECTOR. OF BOTTOM. GOOD MORNING WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- IT'S TRUE MY NAME'S CHUCK BONHAM. AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE. THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED A PRETTY MODEST. ADDITIONAL FREE PERMANENT POSITIONS. AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR GENERAL FUND. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE. AND TWO ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS AT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR ONGOING. SO WHY DO WE MAKE THAT REQUEST. IS TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL YOU JUST REFERENCE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY THE AUTHORS IN THE IN THE CHAMBER. AND WHAT IS THAT BILL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT- SURMOUNTABLE CHALLENGE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE OR DIMINISH THE ABILITY FOR WILDLIFE TO ROAM. AND THAT IS THE PHRASE CONNECTIVITY THAT IS IN THE TITLE OF THE BILL IT'S THE SUBJECT OF THE BILL AND THE BILL WILL ALLOW OUR DEPARTMENT TO PRODUCE A SERIES OF GUIDELINES THAT CREATED ECONOMICS INCENTIVES. FOR TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCLUDE CONNECTIVITY IN THEIR PROPOSALS AND PROJECTS AND OUR DEPARTMENT CAN GIVE CREDIT FOR THAT IN THE REGULATORY SPACE THAT EXISTS AROUND IMPACTS AND MITIGATIONS UNDER LAW WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS. IT'S DEFINITELY A CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY IT PRODUCES PUBLIC BENEFITS THE SINGLE BIGGEST BECAUSE OF WILDLIFE MORTALITY IN THE STATE IS VEHICLE COLLISIONS WHICH CREATES AN INCREASED INSURANCE BURDEN ON CITIZENS AS WELL. YOU GET A BENEFIT FROM ECONOMIC INCENTIVES IT'S AN INCENTIVE DRIVEN APPROACH THROUGH CREDITS RATHER THAN A FEE BASED APPROACH AND OF COURSE YOU GET WILDLIFE BENEFITS. TWO EXAMPLES THAT PROVE THE BENEFITS. LAST WEEK US SENATOR STERN- THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS CELEBRATED THE LAUNCH TO THE- GREAT LEADERSHIP OF LAW CENTER BIRDS FOUNDATION SOMETHING CALLED THE WALLIS ANNENBERG WILDLIFE CROSSING IN LOS ANGELES. IT'LL BE THE WORLD'S LARGEST WILDLIFE CROSSING ACROSS HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE. IT IS PERHAPS OUR LAST BEST CHANCE TO CURE ALL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PREVENT EXTINCTION OF A MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION THAT'S ISOLATED BECAUSE OF THOSE COUNTLESS LANES OF HIGHWAY ONE ON ONE. AND BACK IN MARCH SECOND EXAMPLE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST. PUBLISHED A SERIES OF MAPS ILLUSTRATING THE NATURAL WEALTH OF EACH STATE IN THESE UNITED STATES. AND WHAT THOSE MAPS SHOW IS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF NATURAL WEALTH. BUT WE ALSO HOME TO THE MOST IMPERILLED AMOUNT OF SPECIES. SO WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY IMPLEMENTING SB. SEVEN NINETY IS A GOOD THING TO DO. AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR REQUEST TO YOU THIS MORNING. THANK YOU- MISS AYLER SWEATER THE L. A. O. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT NO COMMENTS FROM US AND WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE FROM. DEPUTY CHIEF DIVISION SEAT CHIEF KETCHUM AND DUNCAN ONLINE I'M LOOKING AT MY COMPUTER. I'D DO YOU GO ALL RIGHT- BEFORE GET TO FINANCE ANYTHING TO ADD HERE OF FINANCE NOTHING TO HIDE THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND HERE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY- I KNOW CENTER STERN HAS QUESTION SO. SENATOR HERE RECOGNIZE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR BOTTOM FOR YOUR- YOUR PRESENTATION- IT WAS A HISTORIC DAY AT LAST WEEK AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY AND TRULY BREAKING NEW GROUND- IN REWILDING OUR BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW SOME SOME HOPE FOR SUCH AS THE MONALISA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT- FOR ALL THE- SHE'S THAT ARE. ENDANGERED OR OTHERWISE ISOLATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I WANTED TO GET A SENSE. YOU KNOW WITH THIS ONE BRIDGE WILL NOT DO IT. AS EXCITING AS LAST WEEK WAS WE KNOW THAT. WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE CROSSINGS MORE LINKAGE WE'RE STAE THAT DRIVES AT HIGH SPEEDS IN MANY PLACES THAT ARE WILD PLACES- I WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU AND IDEALLY ALSO FROM. THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION WHO I REALLY APPRECIATE JOINING THE HEARING AND BEING ON THE LINE- THE GOVERNOR'S SORT OF. HOW THIS FITS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S BIG BIGGER VISION ON IMPLEMENTING THIRTY BY THIRTY AND- BIODIVERSITY. AND THE SORT OF BROADER WILD WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY PROPOSALS THAT THAT ARE BEING PUT FORTH IN THE BUDGET- THEN JUST PUT A FINER POINT ON THAT- THESE ARE THESE ARE- SPECIFIED IS COMPENSATORY MITIGATION CREDITS. BUT I'M REALLY HOPING TO GET A TIMELINE ON WHEN THE GUIDELINES. WILL BE. COMPLETED AND HOW SOON FUNDING WILL BE EMERGING FROM FROM THIS FRAMEWORK- BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW AROUND THE STATE- AND- I'M WONDERING IF THOSE PROJECTS ARE ARE JUST GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT ANY- WITHOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM. OR ANY SORT OF COMPENSATORY MITIGATION FUNDING- FOR CURRENT. PROJECTS UNDERWAY OR FOR. EDGEX ANTICIPATED IN THE YEAR DURING THE PENDENCY OF THESE GUIDELINES. GREAT QUESTION CENTER AND- LET'S TAKE A STAB AND THEN SEE IF OUR CALTRANS COLLEAGUES HAVE ANYTHING TO. RECTOR AT. IT FITS REALLY WELL SO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND YOUR BILL SIT SQUARELY AND MY VIEW OF WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO HEAD. AND IT FITS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS YOU MENTIONED THIRTY BY THIRTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ANALOG IS AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL- WE ARE IN A BIODIVERSITY CRISIS AS YOU ELOQUENTLY STATED LAST WEEK EACH CITIZEN HAS A RIGHT TO A THRIVING NATURE. AND CONNECTIVITY HELPS US GET THERE. IT SITS REALLY WELL AND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS WHICH YOU'VE HEARD SECRETARY CROWFOOT TALK ABOUT AND JUST LAST FRIDAY. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POSTED- BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN THAT SPACE AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO OUR DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR CORRIDORS AND CONNECTIVITY. SO IN THE PAST I'VE HAD MOMENTS WHERE WE'VE HAD GREAT IDEAS BUT NO FUNDING. NOW WE HAVE REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO GET MORE OF THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS DONE. BUT IT'S AN INCENTIVE BASED APPROACH SO IT FITS WELL BOTH IN THE SENSE OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOOTPRINT IS BUILDING OUT TO BE AND HOW IT'S MODERNIZE IT. AND DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT FUTURE PROOFS US IF WE DON'T LEAVE ROOM TO ROAM FOR ANIMALS CLIMATE CHANGE AND BAR HARDSCAPE. WILL CONTRIBUTE TO EXTINCTION OF SPECIES IN THE STATE. IT ALSO FITS IN A CONTEXT OF- WHAT GOVERNOR. NEWSOM IN SECRETARY CRAWFORD OF ADVANCING WHICH IS CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE TO GET MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY GOOD PROJECTS DONE FASTER OFTEN MY DEPARTMENT IS A HANG UP IN THAT SPACE. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING SB SEVEN NINETY AS A WAY TO GIVE A BENEFIT TO A SISTER AGENCY LIKE CALTRANS OR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. SOMETIME ON. I'M GOING TO STAY PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO OFFER CREDITS WHILE WE'RE MOVING PROJECTS TO THE CURRENT PIPELINE LET ALONE THE FUTURE PIPELINE. SO I HOPE IT'S LESS THAN A YEAR TO DO GUIDELINES WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO GET READY. ON THE KIND OF FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL SEE THIS FUNDING YOU KNOW COME JULY ONE. IN I'LL GIVE YOU A FLAVOUR OF PLACES THAT COULD BENEFIT WITHOUT TRYING TO. A COMMITMENT TODAY SENATOR DOLLARS IT'S VERY THE STATE ONE OF OUR MOST MAJESTIC DEER HERDS UP IN THE LOYALTON HEARD AS YOU GO NORTH ON EIGHTY NINE- THAT'S A PLACE WE CAN LOOK AT CONNECTIVITY IN COURT OR TO GO ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS YEAR'S THREE NINETY FIVE HAS INCREDIBLE ANTELOPE HERDS THAT HUNTERS LOVE THAT RELATE TO CONNECTIVITY CHALLENGES DOWN IN THE HOBBY DESERT BETWEEN ST LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS WE'VE GOT. I CONDUCT DESERT BIGHORN SHEEP POPULATIONS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY YOU GO UP INTO THE BAY AREA THE MOST DEADLY STRETCH OF HIGHWAY IN CALIFORNIA FROM AN ANIMAL MORTALITY PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN YOU LEAVE THE BAY AREA AND YOU DRIVE DOWN THE PALO ALTO IN TWO EIGHTY- WE'VE GOT. A MALE ALLIANCE. YOU THINK OR THE TEMECULA AREA. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE FIXABLE. WHEN YOU HAVE FUNDING. PARTNERSHIPS CREATIVE THINKING AND REGULATORY KIND OF MARKET DRIVEN INCENTIVES LIKE YOUR BILL PROPOSES THANKS FOR THE TIME. CALTRANS. YEAH I AM I WOULD CALTRANS- AND I'M- HAPPY TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU HAVE W. WE HAVE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH EDF W. WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN MANY ARENAS WITH THEM ALL THE WHILE THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY ISSUE ALREADY- THIS IS AN AREA WHICH THE DIRECTOR BOTTOM MENTIONED WHERE THE CALTRANS WOULD BE A BENEFICIARY OF THE CREDITS THAT ARE- CREATED SO- BUT WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY ARE USEFUL CREDIT SO- WORKING TOGETHER- TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND- INSURE THAT- THE CREDITS ARE USEFUL I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH THE SHE GET HELP ON THE PART OF FISH WILDLIFE- SENATORS. MENTIONED THE MEDICATION AT BUT THE LARGEST OF THIS- WHILE I'VE CONNECT TO THE- MEDICATIONS AFTER. THERE'S ALSO A ROOM FOR. IN TERMS OF ENHANCEMENT AND GRANTS THERE'S- FUNDING THAT'S COMING AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL STANDPOINT SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF INVENTORY WORK TO IDENTIFY WHERE THESE HOTSPOTS ARE LOCATED. IN THE WILL BE A WELCOME. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY GRANT OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME BAILABLE AND ALSO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE- ANY OTHER MITIGATION. OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL SO THERE'S- BOTH HAVE BEEN AND THE MITIGATION. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH OF THOSE ANGLES- TO MAXIMIZE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT- SOME OF LARGE MAMMALS THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. FOR ALL. AND OTHER SPECIES. THAT WILL USE. MAYBE EVEN ON CROSS. MUCH COST BUT A LOT OF BENEFITS THE SPECIES THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO. FURTHER PARTNERING AND ABLE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THANKS FOR THAT THE COMMUNIST CATCH HIM AND- PRETTY YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR JOKED LAST WEEK THAT IT'S NOT OFTEN EVERYONE STANDS UP AND APPLAUDS CALTRANS FOOT- IN- YOU KNOW EVEN AMONG THE PUBLIC YOU HAVE PEOPLE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- APPLAUDING YOU FOR THIS SORT OF- DEVOLVE WAY LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT SO. BUT IT IS WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY THAT- FOR THE NEAR TERM DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE GUIDELINES IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION. THAT IN ORDER TO GET. SOURCES AND THEN BUT THERE WON'T BE SOME KIND OF ADVANCED MITIGATION ACCOUNT AS- SB ONE ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE SORT OF- ADVANCE FUNDING PRIOR TO PROJECT APPROVAL THAT COULD BE AGGREGATED- AND SAY. YOU KNOW YIELDS SIGNIFICANT FUNDS EVEN AS SOON AS THIS FISCAL YEARS THAT AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION SHOULD WE BE THINKING MORE ABOUT. THAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING MORE ABOUT JUST DOING THIS THROUGH. EXISTING DOLLARS AND NOT DEPENDENT ON THIS PROGRAM TO GET THESE OTHER PROJECTS GOING- MITIGATION PER PROJECT OCCURS WHETHER WE'RE DOING WHAT THE FASCINATION OR NOT- BUT ADVANCED MITIGATION THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET MITIGATION AHEAD OF PROJECTS THAT WERE NOT DELAYING OUR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. WE CAN ALSO AGGREGATE. EDUCATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE POSTAGE SIZE MITIGATION WE HAVE LARGER MITIGATION- BUT TOGETHER SO IT'S NOT A SMALL MITIGATION THAT'S WHAT'S AFFECTED- AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE WILDLIFE CAN% ACTIVITY THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF OUR INVESTIGATION IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE TIRED IN IT THERE'S- OTHER RESOURCES THAT WE MITIGATE SUCH AS WETLANDS THAT- SPECIES THAT DON'T MOVE HIKE UP PLANTS AND HABITATS THE- RECROSS THE STATE SO THIS IS ONE COMPONENT OF IT WE ARE. DEFINITELY MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR OVERALL ADVANCE NEGATION PROGRAM WE'VE IDENTIFIED PROJECTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THEM BUT THIS EFFORT RELATED TO WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY WILL EXPAND OUR ABILITY AND ALSO MERRY SOME OF OUR- ADVANCE NEGATION EFFORTS WITH THE WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY NEED THAT IS OUT THERE- SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS. BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE SOME OF OUR ADVANCED MEDICATION ABOUT FUNDING IN A WAY THAT IS- STILL GOING TO ADVANCE- TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AN EX EXPEDITE THOSE BUT ALSO NEED SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE RELATED TO WHILE I CONNECTED. SENATOR FROM MY IT SO JUST THE PUBLIC DECLARATION MY DOOR PERSONALLY IS OPEN TO TALK ABOUT ANY PROJECT IN THE SENSE OF ADVANCED MITIGATION AS WELL. I THINK GERMAN KNOWS THAT. IN TOMORROW- ACTUALLY BE WITH CALTRANS AND SECRETARY CRAWFORD AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. STONE TO SENATOR LAYERED IN SANTA CRUZ S. HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN WAS GOING THROUGH KIND OF MODERNIZATION. FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO- WE- ROAD AND AGREE WITH. THAT WAS OUR FIRST OF PILOT OR HAVE BEEN AGAIN. AND WE KNOW HAVE A OUTLINED UNDER CROSSING AT ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT CURBS ON HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN SO IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE. YOUR BILL WILL MAKE IT FASTER AND MORE CLEAR BUT WE ALSO NEED TO AVAIL OURSELVES OF ADVANCED PROGRAMS AS WELL. THEY SAID INSIDE EVAN PRECIADO THE TESTERS TEST MY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ITEM- THANKS FOR TAKING EXTRA TIME ON IT- I KNOW WE HAVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION APPROVED BUDGETED- BUT I WOULD I WOULD JUST ASK AS YOU AS YOU ROLL THIS OUT. KEEPING GAUGING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AT OUR CONSERVANCIES- AND OTHER ENTITIES TO GET STRATEGIC ABOUT THIS WORK NOT TO JUST BE REACTING PROJECT BY PROJECT BUT TO GET AHEAD OF THIS AN INTEGRATED INTO YOUR BROADER REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY PLANNING- AND TRY TO GET SOME BIG VISIONARY WORK DONE THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S A GOOD YEAR TO DO IT- THIS IS REAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE ARE ALSO UNION JOBS I SHOULD NOTE THAT AND- AND ANYWAY I APPRECIATED BOTH. BOTH DEPARTMENTS WORK. VERY GOOD THAT CENTER DOLLY. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. ASK THE DOCTOR BOTTOM- AND WE SWITCH SPOKE- LAST YEAR ABOUT THE ISOLATION QUITE FRANKLY OF THE MOUNT LINE UP AND IN THE UP STATE WHERE THEY CAN'T SO THEY'RE INTERBREEDING IN THE- SO ARE YOU GUYS ARE YOU ABLE TO. BEFORE WE GET THESE CROSSINGS IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE- YOU KNOW THE WORK DONE ARE YOU ABLE TO MITIGATE THROUGH MOVING- IT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE TO. GET OVER YEAH SO THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CORRECT SCIENTIFIC WORD IS BUT BASICALLY SO THAT THEIR DOORS NOT INTERPRETING IN THE SAME AREA FOR A LONG TIME. YES BUT- SO WE WITH THE PARK SERVICE WHICH YOU KNOW IS A GOOD PORTION OF THE- SANTA MONICA'S DOWN THERE WE ARE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN KIND OF SCIENTIFIC PILOT PROJECTS IN THAT SPACE. IN THE BUT PART IS I MEAN THE LIFE CYCLE OF MOUNT LENSES WHEN YOU. RELOCATE A YOUNG MALE YOU OFTEN END UP PUTTING THAT ANIMAL IN THE TERRITORY THAT'S ALREADY OCCUPIED. AND OF COURSE THEY COMPETE- SO WE'RE DOING SOME OF THIS FOR MONITORING AND WE'RE LEARNING. ANSWERED ALL OF THE OTHER THING I'D ADD IN THE SPACE IS KIND OF THE YES BUT THE BUT PART. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT THE PLACE YOU'RE RELOCATING A LARGE PREDATOR WELCOMES US MOVING A PREDATOR TO THEIR BACKYARD SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES- BUT IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY PART OF WHAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN IN THE STATE WE ALSO SEE THE SAME THING GOING ON WITH SOME OF THE FISH SPECIES.
