I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU IN TRYING TO DEVELOP COMMUNITIES THAT MINIMIZE AND EVEN OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES PROVIDE UP ROBUST PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HOUSING NEEDS ARE MET I YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE COMING TO CHAIR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE FROM NATURAL RESOURCES IS MAKING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES TRANSPORTATION HOUSING CLIMATE. EQUITY ISSUES ARE ALL PARTS OF THE SAME ISSUE RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE- CLIMATE CHANGE IS CONNECTION TO HOW WE LIVE EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND RECOGNIZING THAT TO REALLY COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RETHINK IN MANY CASES HOW WE LIVE. AND HOW WE PLAN FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.

THE HEARING. SO AS WE ALL KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND WE'RE BEYOND JUST PREVENTING IT WE'RE SEEING THE IMPACT EVERY SINGLE DAY HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE HAVE UNDER DISCUSSED IN UNDER CONSIDERED AN ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. NOT TO MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T STILL MAKE ADVANCES IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. UP BUDGET WE KNOW ALSO THAT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN UNDER INVESTED ARE BEARING THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WILL DO SO IF NOT PRIORITISED. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES ARE AREAS THAT ARE ENJOYABLE AND SAFE TO LIVE IN. WHILE ALSO PROVIDE EASY ACCESS TO JOBS HEALTHCARE EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT AND COMMERCE. CONSIDER WALKING AND BIKING TO ALL NECESSARILY SERVICES UNNECESSARY SERVICES WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES WALL BREATHING CLEAN AIR AND CONTRIBUTING TO PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR SUCH AS THE WALKING AND BIKING IT'S ALSO THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD ALSO BE WITHIN A FIFTEEN MINUTE PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDE. OF ALL OF THE SAME SERVICES. CALIFORNIA HAS EXPLICITLY FOCUSED ON BUILDING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WITH LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE ACTION SINCE TWO UP TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WHEN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WAS ENACTED. THAT BILL REQUIRES METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS TO CONSIDER LAND USE DECISIONS IN ORDER TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH REDUCTION IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THE CROSS CUTTING NATURE OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES EXPLICITLY REQUIRES ACTION FROM AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING. CURRENT PLANS OFTEN DO NOT PROVIDE EXPLICIT ROADMAPS ARE MOVING FORWARD WHICH LEADS TO A LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN AGENCIES IN THE PLANNING PROCESS AND A DIFFERENCE IN UNDERSTANDING ACROSS THE STATE. BY THOSE AGENCIES IN WHAT IS LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRED. A LACK OF THE LACK OF FISCAL CONSTRAINT IN PLANTS OFTEN CREATES ELECTIVE IMPACT ON INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IT'S GONNA TAKE ADVOCATES AGENCIES AND POLITICAL WILL IN THE HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH AREAS TO CREATE TRULY SUSTAINABLE AND LIVABLE COMMUNITIES FOR EVERYONE. WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE RE SOURCE AND THE COUPLE. TO ACHIEVE THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL TODAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION REGARDING ALIGNMENT OF THESE RESOURCES AND THE CREATION OF A ROAD MAP FOR MORE SUCCESSFUL CREATIONS OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. NOW I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALEX LEE HERE AND I WANTED TO KNOW IF HE HAS ANY COMMENTS- AS WE MOVE INTO THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH- FRIEDMAN FOR ORGANIZING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR FROM OUR PANEL TODAY. ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT TO ADVANCE OUR GOALS OF PROTECTING THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. I'M A STRONG BELIEVER THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. A GREAT AMENITIES OF A WALKABLE COMMUNITY OR TRANSPARENCY THROUGH MEANS THAT WE ENJOY WE GONNA VACATIONS TO EUROPE OR ASIA. SO IT'S SOMETHING. THAT IS THAT YOU OF COURSE DEVELOPED WORLD AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALIGNING OURSELVES TO FUTURE. SPECIAL LOOK AT OUR LAND USE PATTERNS ASSEMBLY SAID TO BE HERE TODAY YOU. THANK YOU AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. TODAY WE HAVE THREE PANELS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE FIRST AND SECOND PANEL. I NEVER GONNA HAVE MEMBER QUESTION AND ANSWERS. TO COVER BOTH PANELS- I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY TO DISCUSS DISCUSS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. DR STEFANIE PEN. PEN CELTIQUE. CONCEPTUAL WHO'S A PHD ARM CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. AND THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CENTER OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AT UCLA- WELCOME DR AND I BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO BE WITH US A BUYER- ASSUME CORRECT. GREAT YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M A BIG ADMIRER OF YOUR OLD. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU AND SEE YOU AND WELCOME AND THANKS AGAIN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US ALL THANK YOU- I WAS JUST GONNA SAY WHAT A BEGIN MEYER I AM OF YOURS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IT'S REALLY. INSPIRING AND GIVES US A LOT OF HOPE ABOUT THE FUTURE. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME TO FRAME THIS- BEGINNING OF THIS DISCUSSION- MY BACKGROUND IS IN LAND USE I WROTE A BOOK ON THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF LAND USE THE STATE OF WORKED ON VARIOUS. ISSUES OF HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANNING OR JUST RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PAPER ON NEW HALL RANCH- AND I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN SO THESE ISSUES ARE ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. SO I GREATLY WELCOME. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SOME REMARKS ABOUT LAND USE AND LAND USE CHANGE. AND STATE TO FRAME THIS DISCUSSION. SO AS I WAS- WAS SAID EARLIER LAND USE AND LAND DEVELOPMENT IT IS- THEY ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY AFFECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EXPOSURE TO HEAT AND FIRE CARBON SEQUESTRATION ECOLOGICAL BIODIVERSITY AGRICULTURE. EXPOSURES TO HIGH HEAT AND NEARLY EVERYTHING. I ALSO THINK THAT MOST OF US WOULD AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF OUR POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS LAND USE IN THE STATE IS KIND OF BROKEN. IT'S A REGULATORY LEGACY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND WE'VE MOVED IT TO THE TWENTIETH IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BY HAD A CHANCE MEASURES. ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL BUT CURB AGREE JUST PROJECTS ADDRESSED THE ISSUE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PROTECTING DANGEROUS SPECIES CREATING HORSES DATEABLE CITIES SO IT COUNTS SEQUOIA AB THIRTY TWO SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AS ONLY SOME OF THOSE MEASURES. SO WE MUST. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAND JUST AS WE HAVE TODAY IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF OVER A CENTURY OF PROCESS SEATS WERE IN LOCALITIES OF LOCAL AND USES AS THEIR MAIN DOMINANT FORMS OF SOURCES OF REVENUE. HOTEL TAXES SALES TAXES AND SO ON OVERLAID BY MANY DECADES OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL SEGREGATION REDLINING RACISM AND WHITE FLIGHT WITH ZONING AS A WEAPON FOR DISCRIMINATION. THE SINGLE FAMILIES ON WAS DEVELOPED AS A MECHANISM TO PROTECT WHITE PEOPLE FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE WERE RELEGATED TO SEPARATE HAD MORE DENSE NEIGHBORHOODS. GROSS SO MANY CALIFORNIA CITIES WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF WHITE FLIGHT CREATING INDEPENDENT SUBURBS. WITH THEIR OWN TAXPAYERS SWITCHING OUT WELL OFF OF THE OLDER URBAN CORES FOR JOBSSTILL REMAINED AND SUPPORTED BY SUBSIDIZED ROAD AND HIGHWAY BUILDING. COMMUNITY COMMUTING ONE OUT AND THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO JUMP ONTO THE BANDWAGON. GREEN-FIELDS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN EASIER TO DEVELOP AND THE STATE'S POST PROPOSITION THIRTEEN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT LAWS AMONG OTHER MEASURES. WHAT MADE IT EVEN EASIER FOR LARGE SCALE. SUBURBAN DEVELOPERS. THIS IS OBVIOUS. OVERSIMPLIFICATION BUT EVEN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ATTEMPTS TO CURB SPRAWL FOR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS FOR ATTEMPTED MOSTLY TO FAIL. IN THE END IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE GOT BOTH SYKORA THAT WAS UP TO MAKE OBVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY ON THE URBAN FRINGE AND PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. THESE ARE ONLY COMPOUNDED EXISTING DISTORTIONS REWARDING STRIP MALL DEVELOPERS AS THOSE INCREASED SALES TAXES AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY OWNERS- THESE FURTHER UNDERMINED OF MULTIPLE UNIT HOUSING NEIGHBORHOODS WITH MIXED USE OF THE- TYPES OF HOUSING- VARIOUS TYPES OF HOUSING ON THE SAME STREET ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROVISION OF OPEN SPACE AND MUCH MUCH MORE. I WOULD ARGUE PRIVATIZING A GREAT DEAL OF THE PUBLIC GROUND. LEAVES US DEVELOPED AND CONTINUE TO CREATE LAND AND MATERIALS EXPERT PICKS STUDENTS OF FORMS OF LAND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRING MILES OF NEW ASPHALT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PETROLEUM. AND PARKING LOTS CONCRETE RIBBONS OF ROADS AND SIDEWALKS POWER LINES PIPELINES UNDERMINING ALL BEST ATTEMPTS TO CREATE MORE SUSTAINABLE CITIES. SO RATHER THAN MAKING BETTER USE OF THE ALREADY DEVELOPED BUT OFTEN UNDER UTILIZED URBAN FABRIC WE MOVED UPWARD. LEAVING THOSE AREAS BEHIND UNLESS OUR TARGETS FOR GENTRIFICATION WHICH SIMPLY EXACERBATES HOUSING QUALITIES IN THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR HALF A CENTURY AND IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UNWIND. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND UNPACKED TO MOVE FORWARD. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE CAUGHT IN A BY. THEY RELY ON LOCAL REVENUES FOR THEIR OPERATIONS AND LOCAL REVENUES ARE GENERATED BY LAND USE SO THE TENT IS ON FOR HIGHROAD STUFF MAKES SENSE BUT IT UNDERMINES COMMUNITY UNDERMINES CLIMATE GOALS AND UNDERMINES AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. USABLE FINANCES IT'S EVOLVED OVER THE DECADES AND ESPECIALLY WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX. YES STRETCHED AND BRUTAL. SO CLIMATE CHANGE AS MORE URGENCY TO ADDRESSING THE SLEDGES PATTERN BUT ONE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT THE POOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE FAILED TO SLOW VIOLENCE OF THIS SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY TO EXPERIENCE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED HIGHER NUMBERS A FEW DAYS AND HIGHER HEAT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN OTHERS AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF INCREASED FINANCIAL IS ATION REALISTIC. ONE SECTOR IN MY OPINION- BUT NOT JUST MY OPINION I THINK IT'S AN INFORMED OPINION- ABOUT SEEMS TO SKATE MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOW CHARACTERIZED BY EVEN LARGER SCALE BUILDERS AND EQUITY CAPITAL. IT SECTOR IT IS OUR TIME PLAN DETERMINING DELAY OUT OF HOW WE LIVE OUR ABILITY TO INTERACT TO GET FROM PLACE TO PLACE OUR ACCESS TO OPEN SPACES AND SHOPPING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ANCILLARY POLLUTION. SUSTAINABILITY HAS BECOME TRANSLATED INTO CARBON OFFSETS SO STEPPING BACK ONE MUST ASK WHAT KIND OF VISION FOR HOW THE DESIGN AND BUILD THE PLACES WE ALL LIVE IN DOES THE INDUSTRY HALF WHAT IS THE VISION LARGELY DRIVEN BY FINANCIAL FORMULAS FOR PROFIT WHICH ARE NOT SMALL IF YOU START LOOKING UP THE PROFIT MARGINS OF LARGE SCALE DEVELOPERS IT'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. ANNUALLY AFTER ALL. HOW CAN NEW YORK CITY EQUITY CAPITAL REALLY CARE WHAT HAPPENS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD OTHER THAN UNDERSTANDING THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT A FOR CONCERNED ABOUT PRODUCING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. DECENT HOUSING PEOPLE CAN AFFORD AND DOESN'T HAVE TO OUR CLIMATE BURDEN THAT CREATE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES WE ARE IN A CONTEXT WHERE LAND IS SO PRIVATELY AND DEVELOPMENT IS LARGELY DONE BY PRIVATE COMPANIES. IT'S DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRUCTURED AROUND EXCHANGE VALUE OR PROFIT. THAT IS TO SAY PROFIT CLASSICALLY THE SITUATION HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS THE TENSION BETWEEN USE VALUE BEING IN A PLACE AS A HOME AND USING IT AS YOUR HOME AND EXCHANGE VALUE. THE MARKET DRIVEN FORCES THAT SHAPE OUR VIEW THAT LAND OWNERSHIP IS A FINANCIAL ASSET. IF OWNERSHIP IS AN ASSET THAT WE WANT PRICES TO GO UP TO MAKE A PROFIT. BUT IF OWNERSHIP OR ACCESS TO HOUSING IS A HUMAN NEED THEN THE MARKET MOTIVATIONS FOR PROFIT ARE INCOMPATIBLE. SO WHAT WHAT IS TO BE DONE. WE NEED MANY MORE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN LAND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE STATE TO THAT IS GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGIONAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT. CAN GUIDE THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND RATES OF RETURN FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPERS THAT DRIVE DOWN COSTS AND WE HAVE A MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF SITUATION WITH A PRIVATE MONOPOLY UTILITIES THEY PROVIDE A PUBLIC SERVICE WE ENABLE THE SHAREHOLDERS TO MAKE A PROFIT BUT ONLY HONEST CERTAIN LEVEL. THE STATE THAT IS AGAIN GOVERNMENT. WHATEVER SCALE USED TO PURCHASE LAND USING EMINENT DOMAIN TO PROVIDE HOUSING AFTER ALL IF WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO PURCHASE LAND FOR FREEWAYS BY EMINENT DOMAIN WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE LAND FOR HOUSING BY EMINENT DOMAIN I KNOW IT'S A VERY BIG ASK BUT I ALSO THINK IT. IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CRITICAL. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONES BUT DOESN'T NEED A LIMON HANGS SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS BY ANY MEANS IT JUST MEANS THE ZONE ITSELF. IS A- NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT COMPLETELY AND ALLOW GENTLE DENSITY TO GRADUALLY CHANGE OVER THE STERILE SINGLE FAMILY ZONE INCLUDING AND INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO BUILD NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL. WITH A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE RECENTLY PASSED MINNEAPOLIS PLAN WERE IN MINNEAPOLIS THEY LOOKED AT THEIR ZONING AND REALIZED IT WAS A LEGACY OF HISTORICAL RACISM AND THAT THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONE. ENDED UP REINFORCING PRIVILEGE TO A DEGREE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY SO THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE UNLIMITED OF THE SINGLE FAMILIES ARE YOU CAN STILL HAVE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BUT YOU'RE ALSO ALLOWED. THIS GENTLE DENSITY I'M THROUGHOUT THE CITY THAT I THINK- REALLY BEGINS TO CHANGE THE EQUATION ABOUT HOW WE THINK OF WHERE WE LIVE AND WE COULD HAVE. YOUR KID TO WALK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE YOU CAN GET YOUR HAIR CUT OR AND YOU HAVE MUCH BETTER ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITH THIS KIND OF DENSITY. I ALSO THINK THAT- THE STATE COULD BE TO PROVIDE LOW TO NO INTEREST LOANS TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD EIGHTY USE DUPLEXES AND MORE WE NEED TO FLEXIBLE. FINANCE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WISH TO HAVE VERY MODEST INCOMES CAN STILL. REDEVELOP THEIR LANDED INCLUDE THE EIGHTY USE A GRANNY FLAT THE DUPLEX AND THE REST BUT ACCESS TO FINANCING IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND WE NEED TO RETHINK- FINANCING IN THAT REALM IN FURTHER TRAINING IN THE BUILDING TRADES. TO GROW THAT SECTORS SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR MANY SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT WE RECENTLY BUILT IN EIGHTY YOU IN THE BACK OF OUR DAUGHTERS OF PROPERTY BUT TO FIND A BUILDER. WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE ON SUCH A SMALL PROJECT WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR MUCH BIGGER PROJECTS. AND THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY IN THE BUILDING TRADES TO DO MANY MANY DIFFERENT PROJECTS AT ONCE SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN UPSKILLING PEOPLE INTO THAT. INTO THAT SECTOR. WE AND THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA EITHER WE NEED TO ENFORCE PERMANENT ONES. AHEAD TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. IF YOU DRIVE AROUND MOST OF OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS YES WE HAVE DEAD SPRAWL BUT IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF LAND TO BE DEVELOPED. IN THE EXISTING URBAN FABRIC AS I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. BUT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN BUILT AND ADVERTISE THAT INVESTMENT AND THAT CREATES NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ENCOUNTER EACH OTHER. WE CAN HAVE SOCIAL LIVES A WEEKEND ACCESS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WE CAN BUILD ACCESSIBLE AND SMALL SCALE OPEN SPACES THAT ARE DOTTED ALL AROUND. WE NEED TO HAVE THE GOAL OF CREATING GENEROUS AND HOSPITABLE CITIES AND. DENSITY IS CERTAINLY A PART OF THAT- AND WE CAN ONLY DO SO BY LIMITING DEVELOPMENT WHERE IT REALLY SHOULD BE GOING. NOT FAR HIGHER FIRE RISK AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I ALSO THINK- WE'VE NEGLECTED TO REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THE PROPORTIONS THAT REFLECT THE NEED NOT JUST YOU KNOW A SMALL SET ASIDE LIKE FOUR UNITS IN TWO HUNDRED THAT ARE AFFORDABLE BUT ACTUALLY IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE REVERSE GIVEN THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOCTOR I MEAN. TO- MAYBE QUICKLY FINISH HERE THANKS MORE POINTS YES. ALMOST THAT IN FACT I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE POINT- AND IS A WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO PUSH FOR SPLIT ROLL APPROACH TO PROPOSITION THIRTEEN- AND THAT WILL HELP FUND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY SO HEAVILY ON YOUR ON THE SALES TAX. SO I THINK THESE ARE THESE ARE NOT. UNEXPECTED KINDS OF PROPOSALS BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF POLITICAL WILL AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS I KNOW YOU ALL OF THE TRYING VERY VERY HARD. BUT THOSE ARE MY REFLECTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE GOING TO BE STICKING AROUND FOR THE NEXT PANEL SO I'M GONNA ASK THAT WE HOLD ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE NEXT PANEL. AND WITHOUT WILL BRING IN- THE NEXT PANEL WHICH IS THE ROLE OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND BUILDING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ON THIS PANEL. I'M SURE NOT AS MS ROD THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING A COMMUNITY INVESTMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. DARWIN AT MESABI DEPT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN HOUSING COORDINATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. MEGHAN KIRKBY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND CRAIG SHIELDS THE BRANCH CHIEF FOR CLIMATE INVESTMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT AND I WANT TO IN ADVANCE THANK ALL OF YOU FOR GIVING US. SO MUCH OF YOUR VERY VALUABLE TIME TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND WITH THAT I WILL OPEN UP TO THE NEXT PANEL THE NEXT SPEAKER. AND I BELIEVE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHAU HARNESS MISSOURI HAD WHENEVER YOU ARE READY WE CAN SEE YOUR SLIDE BUT NOT YOU OR HEAR YOU. WITH YES WE JUST HEARD YOU IT. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH HELLO EVERYONE AND THIS IS CYRUS MUSES LOOK AT THE DIRECTOR OF THAT CAN YOU YEAH. CAN YOU MISS NOT PLANNING FROM CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ISSUE C. TO INSIDE SYSTEM WILL COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. IN GENERAL AND WHAT WE DO AS AN STATE HERE AND I WILL STOP AND MIGHT BE EASIER TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE NOT HAVING ANY BANDWIDTH ISSUE HERE AND I'M PASSED ON THE SLIDE I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER WHAT TO DO AND SHE'S N. OKAY JOHN- WE ARE ACROSS IS JUST HOPE YOU'RE HAVING A BRAND NEW PROGRAM POLICY INITIATIVE. AND TEAM OVER SHE GOAL IS TRYING RESIDENTS MEETING ARE HAVE A SET UP PRIORITIES LIE TO SOME. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP. RESEARCH AND RESIST AND AGES COURT. THESE GOALS AND PRIORITIES HAVE THEIR BASES IN OUR DISTINCT BUT COMPLEMENTARY SUCH. YES YOU SEE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED. TO- BASICALLY THE BUILT ON SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AND WE HAVE THE SERVER AND COUNCIL THAT HAS DIFFERENT SECRETASE TO BE PART OF IT AND OF YOUR ACCOUNT WILL CLOSE LEGISLATORS AND OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS. A LINE USE THE AND PLANNING TOUCHES NEARLY EVERY EACH OF CALIFORNIA COMPLAINING FACING TODAY AND FARMING LAND THIS PATTERN TO ALIGN AND ADVANCE AND WITH CLIMATE EQUITY HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION IS A KEEP TRACK FOR US. AND PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION PERSPECTIVE. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS- SLIGHT NON. THE SEC OVERSEAS ACROSS SAID DESCRIBING INCLUDING BOTH TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH I WILL GO OVER AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INSTEAD WE CAN USE PROGRAM WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM A CD WAS A PART AGENCIES ABOUT THE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF. OUR SECOND A COLLECTIVE PURITY IS PARTNERING WITH THE AND INVESTING IN KEY MIDEAST ACCOMPLISH BUILDING SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE BY CENTERING COMMUNITIES. IN POLICY PLANNING PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH BY BUILDING AUTHENTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT ENSURING COMMUNITIES HAVE EQUITABLE EASY ACCESS INVESTMENT OTHER RESOURCE INFRASTRUCTURES AS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER ESSENTIAL FEATURES STARTING TWO WEEKS. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON STERN TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH WAS THE MAIN REASON THAT YOU WERE INVITED FOR THIS- COMMITTEE HEARING- TCC PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY LED TRANSFORMATION ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE CAN WE GET BENEFITS THROUGH PROJECTS AND PLANS IN. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OKAY NOT A DEVELOPMENT REPLACE BASEMENTS ME DIFFERENT APPROACH IN HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FACING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE MOTION AND THIS INVEST. TO SEE FUNDS CLIMBED OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT PROMOTE. HUNDREDS EVEN SEE FALLING A ROBUST CROSS SECTORAL COMMUNICATION AND PROCESS IF THIS IS THE PRODUCT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S FUNDS TRANSFORM THE PLANS. AIMED AT FOSTERING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INCREASING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND AVOIDING DISPLACEMENT OF PROJECT. AREA RESIDENTS AND GUESTS. SO I WILL TOUCH ON SOME OF THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE TCC PROGRAM WHICH MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. THE FIRST ONE IS THE COLLABORATIVE STAKEHOLDER DESTRUCTION. DO YOU THINK I LINE'S REQUIRES AN OVERSIGHT BODY COLLABORATIVE OR STRUCTURE THAT GOVERNS HE SEEMS LIMITATION AND CLOSE NOT ONLY PROJECT PARTNERS BUT ALSO RESIDENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TERMS ARE SUBMITTED APPLICATION. AND AMENDED INTO THE GRANT OF. IT'S IN MANY ONE PARTNERSHIP TO ENSURE DESIGN PROJECT AND- THIS IS A COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PARTNERS WORK TOGETHER KIND THE TIME DROPPED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANNELISE AND TRANSFORM THEIR SPACES TO MEET CLIMATE GOALS AND BUILD THEIR COMMUNITIES CONFERENCE. THIS INITIALS. OF THE SMALL CAN BE THE ORDER. THE FIRST EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD PROVIDE IS THE WHAT'S THE RISING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL JUST COMPROMISED STAKEHOLDERS FROM EACH NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES FROM RESIDENTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND THESE TRUCKS WITH MEMBERS. AND HELPING TO TROUBLESHOOT SENSITIVE IMPLEMENTATION. ISSUES SUCH AS PART OF. I SIXTY PLACE THAT THERE WITH STATE TO ORDER TO VISION OF THE APPLICATION. PROJECT CALLED PARTNERS ALSO FORGED A CONNECTIONS TO SHARE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS AS SIMPLE AS SHARING RESOURCE AS FLYERS OR POOLING RESOURCES WITH PARTNERS THEY DON'T HAVE COLLABORATED WITH UP TO SIX. THE OTHER EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A SPOKESMAN IN STOCKTON THE PAST LOCAL ADVANCE PAYMENT RESOLUTION TO ENABLE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATE BY ENSURING MORE FREQUENT CASH. THE COMPONENTS COMPONENT OF THE TCC PROGRAM IS THAT COMMUNITY AND DESIGNED THAT TO HIS MULTI GROUP FOR THE MONTH OF MONTHLY BENEFIT PROJECT PURPOSE. THIS IS THE AUTHORIZES AUTHORIZING STATUTE AND THE PROGRAM FRAMEWORK ASK FOR PROJECTS TO NOT ONLY MEET GHG REDUCTION GOALS BUT ALSO PROVIDE ME MY MENTAL ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS RENTS. THE KING IS THE TCC DIGRESS PROGRAM FRAMEWORK EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES TO DESIGN PROJECTS. WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT'S AND COMEDIANS TAX FLEXIBILITY TO DESIGN SUCH A PROJECT. AND TO SEE WHAT'S ON. THE EXAMPLE IS TRANSFER FRESNO WILL BE HELP. LEAD US OF. KEEP MEETING THEM SPOKE ON THIS A PROJECT WITHOUT. WHAT THE LIVE AND READ THEIR ARTICLE MATTERS IN ADDITION DECREASE GREENHOUSE GAS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE ANY OF FONG MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IF I'M TRYING TO ACCESS YOUR CAR SHARES REGIONAL TRANSIT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. ENERGY INDEPENDENCE PROJECT. CAN BE MICROGRID SOLAR ENERGY PARK RECREATION CENTER. AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR NEXT YEAR KANEMI ET BUS MAINTENANCE MECHANIC MECHANIC'S SOLAR ENERGY EFFICIENCY INSTALLATION METHOD OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE ACT WHICH IS LIKE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE. AND THIS IS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT IS FUNDED UNDER THE TWO SIX. THE OTHER UNIQUE ELEMENT IS THE SUBSTANTIAL AWARD AMOUNT COMMUTING GAUGE MINT AND TRANSFORMING LEVERAGING THE CRIMES OF THE PROGRAM. THE TCC MAKES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS RANGING BETWEEN TEN MILLION TO SIXTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION. WITH IDEAL OF TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT. APPLICANTS MUST BRING PERCENT LEVERAGE COMMITMENTS AND APPLICANTS MUST DEMONSTRATE ALL PROJECT PROPOSAL. AND WENT THROUGH A MEANINGFUL SELECTION PROCESS. TO SEE LOVERS REQUIREMENTS ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO DISINVEST. FOR DISINVESTMENT AREA DURING THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT ON TRACK THE IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS EACH INSURE SUBTLETY CCL. LEVERAGE INVESTMENTS NEED TO COMMUNITY. A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THEN YOU WILL FRIENDS COMMITTEE COLLEGE CAMPUS WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY SITED ELSEWHERE IN FRESNO WELL SPECIFICALLY CITED TO BE WITHIN THAT THIS IS THE PROJECT AREA IN SOUTHWEST FRESNO AS A RESULT OF THE TCC COMMITTEE GAVE PROCESS. THAT ENABLED THE PROJECT TO STAY AND SERVE THE WEST FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE PROJECT LEVERAGE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TO SEE FUNDING FOR URBAN GREENING AND THE PROMISE THAT ADDITIONAL. SEVENTY TO EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM YOUR COLLEGE CAMPUS. THE NEXT ELEMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON. IS BILL. THE TCC BILLS COMMUNICATE POSSIBLY TO FLEXIBLE READINESS REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FACE. THIS IS THE REQUIRED THREE PROJECTS TO BE SHOVEL READY BUT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR REMAINING PROJECTS TO MEET READINESS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE GRANT TO SEE PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DURING APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AND EXPANDING TO PROVIDE CAPACITY BUILDING SERVICING BETWEEN APPLICATION FACE. HE IMPACT IS THAT THIS IS READINESS FOR ALLOW A SPACE BROUGHT THAT EXPECT AND SUPPORT TO BE PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND TO SUPERVISE TECHNICAL SYSTEM RESOURCES TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION UNDER SRI SOURCE COMMUNITIES. I RESIDENTS AND MOREOVER TO PASS A BILL. A GOOD EXAMPLE IS WHAT'S REYES INSIDE THIS MOVIE. APPROPRIATE YOU RECHARGE STATION THE FIRST YEAR OF THE GRANT. AND THEY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DESIGNED FOR CITING YOU CHARGE IN THE STATION THAT MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS. FOR EXAMPLE ENSURING STATION CONNECTED JORDAN ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RESENTING YOU. LEVERAGE GROCERY STORE IN THERE LIKE TO TOUCH ON. LISTEN TO TCC IS AN ONGOING ABOUT WHICH YES YOU SEE HAVE BUILT IN REQUIREMENTS FOR ONGOING TOOK PART IN THE ELECTION OF THE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE GRANTEES AND THE STATES ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER ON VISION AND MISSION OF THE TO SEE PROGRAM. WE ASICALLY INVEST FROM THE BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DELIVERING ON THEIR END OF PROGRAM GOALS AND WE HAVE ECONOMIC PARTNERS TO ABOUT WITH US ON A FREQUENT BASIS. TO MAKE SURE THAT AS IN THE STATE YOU ALSO HAVE ARE STAYING ON TRACK TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE BEEN. WE ARE SUPPORTING THE LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED. MEANS OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT I WILL. SHE AND TIME ANY. YOU MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE OF. PAN AND I AM AN THANK YOU FOR STAYING ON THE TIME I'M- WE'RE HOPING THAT EVERYONE CAN GET THEIR COMMENTS AND EIGHT MINUTES UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO SAY. WE'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME BUT- EIGHT MEN'S WILL GIVE US THE TIME TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY. NEXT WE HAVE DARWIN MESABI FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. WELCOME AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES GRADES- GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRED MANY MEMBERS MY NAME'S ON THE SOLVING OF DEPTH REPORT ABOUT HOW POLICY HERE ADDS MR TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ALL- I WOULD. NEVER TIME THIS TIME DISCUSSING BOTH THE NEED FOR. A BUILDING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES THE ROLE TRANSPORTATION PLAYS IN THAT MISSION AND WHAT KALISTO SPECIFICALLY IS DOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW AND AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CLIMATE CRISIS. AND THEREFORE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US ACROSS GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF THE INCREASING. MASON BEER CLIMATE IMPACTS ALSO AGGRESSIVELY BRINGING DOWN CARBON EMISSIONS TO AVOID- FURTHER CATASTROPHIC OUTCOMES- AND ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. I NEED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION- YOU PROBABLY HARD THE DATA POINT BY NOW ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE- THERE REALLY IS NO TIME TO WASTE WE NEED TO TACKLE. THIS ISSUE NOW NOW IT'S TWO YEARS FROM NOW OR FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- AND THAT'S WHY. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AFTER TWO YEARS OF STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH AND INVITES- CAL STAR LEASED OUR FINAL HAS CORPORATE ACTION PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE OR CAP DIED AS WE CALL IT. BOB KATTER DETAILS HOW THE STATE RECOMMENDS INVESTING BILLIONS OF DISCRETIONARY- I TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO AGGRESSIVELY COMBAT AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE SUPPORTING. PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND THAT COULD BE GOALS- THE PLAN BUILDS ON GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ORDERS TARGETED AT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION- SECTOR TO REACH MISTER TEMPERATURES CLIMATE GOALS- ONE OF THESE SUCH OF THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT YOU MAY RECALL REQUIRED ALL NEW CARS SOLD IN. CALIFORNIA A LADY VEHICLES TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND COMMERCIAL OUR TRUCKS TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE- THESE ARE IMPORTANT IF YOU STEPS IN REDUCING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS- BUT WE KNOW THAT EVEN UNDER THE MOST SIX. SENERE FOR ADOPTED. ADOPTION OF ZERO VEHICLE. ENTER THE ZIP TRANSITION CLEANER FUELS THE FACT IS WE CANNOT MEET. OUR TRANSFER RELATED CRIME GOALS FOR RELYING. ON THE TECH. COMBUSTION ENGINE. VEHICLES OR ON OUR FOR TO COME AND IT CONTINUED. AND INCREASING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED OR VMT AT RECALL IT GRANTS TO UNDERMINE OUR TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS. TO MEET OUR GOALS WE WILL NEED TO COMBINE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY EFFORTS WITH THE MOVE TOWARD REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING- AND REDUCING GUARANTEED. RAPIDLY TO THE ACROSS OVER. YOU ALL TOOLS ON OUR TOOL. I WHICH IS WHY THANK ORDER AND NINETEEN WHICH LED TO THE CREATION OF CAPT I CALLED ON TELSTRA TO LEVERAGE STATE TRANSPORTATION SPENDING DOLLARS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS- CAMPAÑA IT'S A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK AND BLUEPRINT FOR HOW WE PLAN TO PRIORITIZE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. ANYWAY THE REDUCES OUR DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING AND ULTIMATELY GHGS. ENERGY MAKE IT TURNS OUT DOESN'T STATE TO MOVE IN A NEW DIRECTION AND MANSINGH SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION- IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO TRAVEL TO RESEARCH. ON THIS WEEK WITH INCREASING ACCESS TO TRANSIT RAIL WALKING AND BIKING. IT ALSO MEANS CREATING A COMPETITIVE INSIST AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION TRUST AGAIN PEOPLE WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO TIMELY CONVENIENT SEAMLESS AND AFFORDABLE MANNER- AND THAT MEANS MOVING AWAY FROM OUR LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF GIVING A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. TO THE AUTOMOBILE WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING A FUNDING PROJECTS. INSTEAD THE MISSIONS OF FIND WAYS TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS THE GREAT HEALTHIER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL CHOICES ARE PROJECTS THAT ENCOURAGE AND ACCOMMODATE MORE DRIVING. THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF PRIORITIZING MOVEMENT OF VEHICLES OVER THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE HAS HAPPENED BY PROVIDING INEQUITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAS RESULTED IN CAR OWNERSHIP BECOMING AN EXPENSIVE NECESSITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES AND TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE NEED TO INCLUDE SUSTAINABLE LAND USE DECISIONS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT THE BEST TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION IS ACTUALLY- IN THE SOLUTION- SO PROMOTING COMPACT AND FULL DEVELOPMENT WHILE PROTECTING RESIDENTS BUSINESSES FROM DISPLACEMENT. WILL BE KEY IN REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE AND DRIVING AND MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS- WHILE THE SAME TYPE PROTECTING NATURAL MORE MORANTZ FROM. TO MEET MY OF USES. CHAPTER RECOGNIZES CRITICAL LINK BUT TRANS. AND WHAT FIRST PROJECTS WE BILL AND WHERE WE BUILT ON AND THE FACT THAT THAT HAS A KEY INFLUENCE FACTORS THE SORRY NGUYEN USES- WHILE WORKING WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING FOR AND BUILDING UPON ITS OF S. B. Y. CHARACTER IT'S BEEN FOR ON THE JUST. TRANSFER FIRST PRO UNDER THE K. STUMP. WE'RE STILL AGENCIES HAVE A ROLE IN SCHOOL RECOMMEND AND SO FRAUD. THAT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED OF THESE PROGRAMS THE CAB DRIVER CAN BE FOUND ON A HANDOUT THAT WAS PROVIDED PRIOR TO THIS LET'S HEARING- AND JUST USE THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SORT OF TEN PRINCIPLES ALSO FOUND THAT HAND OUT THEY CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT'S CAL SURPRISE TO PRIORITIZE WITH DISCRETIONARY FUNDING AND HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN THESE PROJECTS- CALTRAIN INCLUDES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS THAT MAKE UP THE SWEET OF PROPOSED CHANGES. TO STRANGERS PROTECTION PLANNING OUR PROGRAMMING INVESTIGATION- NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS- AND THESE PROGRAMS PLANS AND PROJECTS ARE ALREADY BEING UPDATED TO REFLECT THESE CAPITA PRIORITIES SINCE CAPITA OFFICERS LAST SUMMER- SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO PROMOTING AND FELT CALTRAIN INCLUDES ACTIONS FOR STATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A LAND USE NEXUS ORLANDO'S CRITERIA TO PROMOTE THE USE OF PRO HOUSING POLICIES. THESE POLICIES BUILDING ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT'S PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION PROGRAM- OPENS AND DEVISE TRANSPORTATION PROJECT APPLICANTS AND THINKING ABOUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR STATE AND LOCAL HOUSING GOALS IN ADDITION TO INCENTIVIZING ENVELOPES APART SAID DRESS AND DIRECT. OUT TO ADDRESS THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFORTS- PROJECTS CAN HAVE ON DISPLACEMENT OF RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY AFTER I ALSO INCLUDE AND THAT TO EXPLORE WAYS. TO INCENTIVIZE JUST STRATEGIES WITHIN FOR- AND THIS WORK IS UNDER. I MAY RESULT IN WRITE COMMITTEE FOR PROGRAM. OR STATUTORY CHANGES TELL TRANSFER PRO COME JUST MORE- IT USED FOR PROCESS AGENCY TO UNDERTAKE THIS WORK IN AND- HOLD ON OUR EXISTING PROGRAM LIKE THE FOR WHAT I SYSTEM COMMITTEES FOR. IN TRANSPORT I'M A COMMUNITY AND I DON'T. I'M POWER- YOU CAN YOU KNOW OUR ARE IN FACT DISPLAY. FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT I NEW PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR TRANSFER PACKED- A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA- AS YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW ALSO KNOWN AS- BUT FOR SUCH INVESTMENT JOBS ACT OR I HAD J. WILL BE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT FUNDS FOR CALIFORNIA OVER THE COMING YEARS. AMONG THE DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS THAT AYE I JANE CREATES IS THE NEW RECONNECTION COMMUNITIES PILOT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING FOR REMOVING RETROFITTING OR MITIGATING EXISTING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES THAT CREATE BARRIERS TO MOBILITY. ACCESS OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES A COMPELLING INVESTMENT TO THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT WAS FIRST CALLED FOR AN CAP GUY. I CALLED THE CALIFORNIA RECONNECTING COMMUNITIES I WAS TO BOULEVARDS PILOT PROGRAM- WHICH IF ENACTED CAN BE USED TO LEVERAGE FUNDING TO COMPETE FOR THIS NEW FEDERAL DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM COULD HELP CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A BILL FOR ONE HOUSING AS WELL AS GREATER CONNECTIVITY AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALL WHILE PLACING A STRONG EMPHASIS ON ANTI DISPLACEMENT STRATEGIES. TO ENSURE CURRENT RESIDENTS BENEFIT FROM THOSE IMPROVEMENTS BY WESTMARCH PROGRAM PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIKE KEY EQUITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA OBJECTIVES AND BUILD UPON. THE SUCCESSES OF OUR PROGRAMS LIKE TEACH EACH YEAR- AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY- ABOUT THE SURGICAL COUNCIL- BEES AND EVERY. AND BUT ALSO PROGRAM. I HAD TO SYSTEM- CAN. OUT BONTA BROUGH CHANGE THAT ARE NAY TO RESPOND TO CHANGE- THE TIMES WERE IN A OBVIOUSLY. A NOTE TRADED BY OTHERS YOU'RE TO. CALLING AT. DIFFERENTLY ACT DIFFERENTLY AND TRUST INVESTMENTS THAN WE'VE DONE A THE PAST- SO WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK- PLEDGE AND AGENCY ON- TO I'M NOT IMPROVE CAP BY- BUT FIND OTHER. TO WORK TO- ON ON MAKING CHANGES NEEDED THAT TO MEET OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL SO ABOUT IT WOULD FORWARD TO. DISCUSSING OUR WORK FURTHER WITH YOU- AND- I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND THEN BACK TO SPEAK HERE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE I APPRECIATE IT. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS MET MAKING KIRKBY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOUSING POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WELCOME. EIGHT ZERO. ADAM GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER- AND TOO MANY. AM AS THAT MY NAME MAY KIRBY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR HOUSE POLICY. I'M ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND IT'S HOUSING AND CLIMATE SMART LOCATIONS- MY COLLEAGUE CRAIG SHIELDS WILL FOLLOW TED DISCUSS WHAT WE USE OUR PORTABLE HOUSING HOW WE USE OUR PORTABLE HAVING FUNDING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M IN HOW WE BUILD MORE SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY HOUSING I'M AND I'LL I'M ALSO JOINED BY OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATION PEDRO GO ABOUT AND OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CODES AND STANDARDS CAL KRAUSE WHO WILL ADDITIONALLY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE Q. ANY PORTION OF OUR DISCUSSION- ACDC IS AN ABUNDANCE OF OPPORTUNITIES REGARDING ACCELERATING INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND RETHINKING OUR LAND USE PATTERNS- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH YOUR FRIEDMAN. ACCELERATING HAND INFILL HOUSING IS GOOD CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY AND GET EQUITY POLICY THIS MEANS IMPROVING HOUSING POTENTIAL AND EXISTING WILL BE A CALM MILES TRAVELED LOCATIONS ON THESE TRANSIT RICH AREAS OF THE STATE. BUT IT ALSO MEANS INTENSIFYING LAND USE PATTERNS AN INFILL AREAS THAT MAY HAVE LESS TRANSIT TODAY PREMIER JOBS AND RESOURCES. THIS WILL HELP PROMOTE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES REDUCE COMMUTES INCREASED DENSITY ALL NECESSARY STEPS AND PAVING. ACTIVES TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION- WHICH WE FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN A RECENTLY RELEASED STATEWIDE HOUSING PLAN. KEEP CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR HOMES PRODUCE MORE AFFORDABLE ON CLIMATE SMART HOUSING CONTINUE TO ACT WITH URGENCY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING NEED. I IN THE STATE RIGHT HOUSING PLAN WE IDENTIFY NUMEROUS LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES WE'RE TAKING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH OUR HOUSING POLICY. JUST A FEW EXAMPLES THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS FOR THIS CYCLE ARE ARE PLANNING FOR HOUSING NEED A WHICH ACT MY DEPARTMENT ASSIGNS EVERY REGION IN CALIFORNIA. TO ACCOMMODATE WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS WE FOCUSED THIS PLANNING PERIOD ON PROMOTING INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIO ECONOMIC EQUITY THE PRODUCTION AND THE PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES. THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS JOBS HOUSING BALANCE GETTING GETTING HOUSING WHERE THE JOBS ARE. AND AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING- AS WELL AS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE REGION'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS SO ALL OF THAT THAT LINK THE STORY MEANS INCREASED PLANNING CAPACITY NEAR JOBS TRANSIT AND RESOURCES. IN A WAY WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THE LAWS ARE ALSO HELPING US. AND DEVELOPMENT FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVALS AND SEE QUICK ACTIONS ALLOWING FOR FASTER DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING A CLIMATE SMART LOCATIONS. WERE ALSO DOING WORK TO EXPAND INFILL AND DENSITY INCENTIVES TO MAKE INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND EASIER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE THAT WHILE AN OPTION NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PLANNING GRANTS TO HELP JURISDICTIONS PLANET X. BUT I HOUSING CLIMATE SMART SMART WAYS. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL ALL AND YOUR RESOURCES BOARD I'M PUTTING OUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE. I IN MORE REGIONAL PLANNING GRANTS ALONG THESE LINES. AND I ACT SO LUCKY TO BE JOINED BY COTTON COLLEAGUES LIKE DARWIN AND HONDAS- WHO REALLY- ARE WORKING WITH ME ON THAT THESE ISSUES IN COLLABORATION. AND DARREN MENTIONED MANY OTHER WAYS WERE COLLABORATING AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE SB ONE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS- ALL RIGHT WHERE WE WORK WITH CALTRANS- ON REQUIRING HOUSING TRANSPORTATION INTEGRATION. UP IT'S IT MAY SOUND SIMPLE- BUT IT'S JUST THAT PUBLIC POLICY WE REQUIRE COMMUNITIES THAT ACCESS THESE GRANTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR HOUSING PLANTS. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING GOOD TRANSPORTATION PLANNING YOU NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HIGHER COMMUNITIES GOING TO GROW AND WHERE THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU'RE GOING TO BE- AT DARREN MENTIONED ARE PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION PROGRAM. AT WHICH IS IT IS BEING EMBEDDED IN NUMEROUS WAYS. THAT PROGRAM REQUIRED JURISDICTIONS IN ORDER TO EARN THAT DESIGNATION ODD TO BE DOING DOZENS OF THINGS THAT ENCOURAGE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND USE PATTERNS AND REDUCTIONS IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. BUT I WANT TO SHARE THEIR WORK ISN'T DONE HERE INFILL HOUSE FOR. CONTINUE TO FACE FIERCE OPPOSITION AND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HURDLES. IT IS NOT AS EASY OR AS AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION AS IT SHOULD BE TO BUILD THAT KIND OF HOUSING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IT CAN TAKE YEARS IT CAN TAKE. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL DEFENSE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN- AND THAT MEANS OUR WORK ISN'T ISN'T DONE- WE HEAR RESIDENTS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER INCREASE TRAFFIC AND PARKING. WHEN INFILL HOUSING WOULD ACTUALLY HELP REDUCE TRAFFIC CUT DOWN ON VEHICLE OWNERSHIP AND ALLOW THOSE WHO WORKING COMMUNITIES TO ACTUALLY AFFORD TO LIVE THERE TOO- THE STATE IS GOING TO USE A COMBINATION OF CARROTS AND STICKS TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACCELERATE HOUSING PRODUCTION. IN WAYS THAT WILL ALSO HELP US KIND CLASS COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEGREGATION. OVERCOMING THESE OBSTACLES AND FILL DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO REQUIRE A CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT PATH THAT WE'RE ON. BUT THAT CHANGES BOTH INEVITABLE AND ESSENTIAL TO A THRIVING CALIFORNIA. NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CRAIG SHIELDS WHO IS OUR- EACH CITY BRANCH CHIEF FOR CLIMATE INVESTMENT- HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL KEY PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. THANKS MEGAN GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JANUARY TEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IDENTIFIES CLIMATE CHANGE AS ONE OF CALIFORNIA S. FIVE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED CLIMATE AND HOUSING APPROACH. ALMOST EIGHT CITIES FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES CONSIDER LOCATION AND PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT AND AMENITIES TO SOME DEGREE WE ADMINISTER THREE FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT PRIORITIZE THAT NEXUS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. THE END FELLOW INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS PROGRAM AND THE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. WELL AGENCY AND IG ARE ONGOING PROGRAMS WITH ON GOING FUNDING ALL THE FUNDING FOR THE G. O. D. PROGRAM HAS BEEN AWARDED. WE HAD A BUILDING HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES SUPPORTS THE REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS TO THAT END THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTS ONE BILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT FURTHERS THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS THROUGH THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AS WELL AS CRITICAL INVESTMENTS AND UNLOCKING STATE OWNED ACCESS SITES AND NON RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS FOR HOUSING. THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM PROMOTES INFILL DEVELOPMENT BY FINDING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY FOR BUILDING HOUSING ON INFILL SITES INFILL DEVELOPMENT PROVIDES BROAD ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT REDUCE SPRAWL VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SINCE ITS FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE IG PROGRAM HAS AWARDED OVER ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL CREATE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE OWNERSHIP PROBLEMS FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND FUNDED HUNDREDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WERE NECESSARY AND REQUIRED FOR THIS HOUSING. PARKS SIDEWALKS TRANSIT LINKAGES TO WATER SERVICE SEWER AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS. WHAT ABOUT HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING TO PROJECTS THAT WILL ACHIEVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WALKING AND BIKING AND TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STATE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SYSTEMIC COMMUNITIES PROGRAM HAS INVESTED APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HE IS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR AWARDS FULL SUPPORT OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS. MORE THAN 92% OF WHICH ARE AFFORDABLE. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES OF BIKE LANES MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED CROSSWALKS THESE PROJECTS ARE ESTIMATED TO REDUCE OVER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO EQUIVALENT IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS THE CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF REMOVING ALMOST ONE MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD FOR A YEAR. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO WORKS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE BUILDING CODES AND STANDARDS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION HCD OVERSEES THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALGARY AND BUILDING CODE. THE FIRST IN THE NATION STATE MANDATED RAIN BUILDING CODE CAL GREEN SUPPORTS TO HELP THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN NEW HOMES YOUR MATERIAL CHOICES THAT IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY AND SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S GOALS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE LATEST ITERATION OF CALGARY IS FOCUSED ON PROMOTING THE USE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO EASY CHARGING IN SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING MANDATING E. CHARGING STATIONS FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED MULTI FAMILY. BUILDINGS HOTELS AND MOTELS THESE CHANGES WHICH WILL TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A QUANTUM LEAP FORWARD BY MANY AND WILL ALLOW RESIDENTS OF NEWLY CONSTRUCTED MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT HOME. THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE CALTRAIN WILL REQUIRE THAT 25230% OF PARKING SPACES INCLUDING CONSTRUCTED MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS INCLUDE EASY CHARGING CAPACITY. AND THESE ARE JUST MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT'S DOLLARS ARE DEFINITELY ALLOWED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. THE CALGARY MINIMUMS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO. EACH CITY'S BROAD SPECTRUM OF HOUSING AND CLIMATE INITIATIVES WITH YOU FURTHER AND WELCOME BACK A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN IMPLEMENTING EIGHT CITIES VISION OF CREATING SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. MORE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANKS. THANK YOU- SO THAT IS YOU ARE THE LAST PANELIST FOR THIS PANEL SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO QUESTIONS AND I WOULD ASK IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING OR WATCHING BY ASSUME. THAT YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM. SOMEHOW I'M AB SO IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS THOUGH FROM OUR LIVE PANEL I'LL GO FIRST TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVY IF YOU LIKE APPRECIATE THE GREATS AND VERY INFORMATIVE TESTIMONY FROM ALL OUR PANELISTS TODAY. I HAD A QUESTION FOR OUR FIRST SPEAKER DR INSTILL- JUST YOU HAD MENTIONED THE TENSION BETWEEN TRYING TO DELIVER COMMUNITY- GOODS FOR US FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND ATTENTION THAT MOST BUILDERS ARE DONE DOING FOR PROFIT YOU SEE ON THE ALTERNATIVE TO BREAKING THE DEADLOCK WITH ATTENTION IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE CALL. YES I'M HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE ANY TO SOLUTIONS WITHOUT THE STATE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF OUR- LAND USE- AND OR- A BUILDING AND SO I THINK THINGS LIKE EMINENT DOMAIN. ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT REDUCING THE AND MIXED USE SO SINGLE FAMILIES ON REALLY- IS AN AND IS NO LONGER NECESSARY GOING INTO THE FUTURE- AND SO I THINK THAT. THESE ARE HARD QUESTIONS AND- WHILE I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE EFFORT THAT'S BEING MADE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THESE TARGETED PROGRAMS I THINK THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS HOUSING THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE ON THE HIGH. AND THE EXCLUSIONARY NATURE OF THAT HIGH END HOUSING BECAUSE OF THESE WILL NOT SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I MEAN CERTAINLY I AM IN FAVOR OF A STRONGER STATE INTERVENTION IN HOUSING I HAVE A BILL RIGHT NOW ABOUT SOCIAL HOUSING SO WE HAVE A STRONG DIRECT EUROPEAN KIND OF ROLE. IN THE PROVISION OF HOUSING- I DO ALSO WANT TO ASK A QUESTION TO A CD IF I'M ELECTED. TO CRAIG SHIELDS AS WELL YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT ALL THE GREAT CREDIBLE INVESTMENTS IN MILEAGE AND- UNITS ARE BUILT. I THINK IN THE HOUSING WORLD IT IS- PLAN USE WORLD. IT IS SOMETIMES ABSTRACT KNOWLES ALIEN FROM HUMAN LEVEL IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS HAVEN'T BUILT. SO THERE ANY SPECIFIC SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. DEVELOPMENTS THAT EACH CITY HAS BEEN. ESPECIALLY PROUD OF THAT WE CAN SITE OR YOU THINK OF AS EXAMPLES OF- YOU KNOW OF A CLIMATE SMART. HOUSING IT'S BEEN DEALT WITH THESE GRANTS. WELL WE'RE PROUD OF ALL OF OUR DEVELOPMENTS OF COURSE AND IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND SEE A FEW OF THEM- D. FELL IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS ONE SUCH PROJECT IT WAS- I DON'T RECALL THE NUMBER OF UNITS BUT IT'S A IT'S A GOOD SIZE- BUILDING AND IT WAS BUILT ON FORMER. CALTRANS LAND- PART OF THE DAY ACROSS TOWN FREEWAYS- ONE OF THE ON RAMP SO. WE WERE THRILLED TO FIND THE PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT- PREVIOUS GENERATIONS- OF THE DESIGN INCLUDED DOZENS OF STRUCTURED PARKING PLACES BY THE TIME. THIS THIS UNIT ARE THIS BUILDING CAME TO FRUITION THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAD ENDED THE REQUIREMENT FOR PARKING SO. THAT ENTIRE STRUCTURE- IS ARNOLD. LIVING UNITS NO PARKING SO WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF I WENT. WHAT WAS THE ADDRESS THAT ONE AGAIN OUR I BELIEVE IT'S FOR. TALENTS HAPPENED CISCO FELL F. E. LD. AT THE L. L. F. E. L. L. OKAY. IT'S LIKE IN A COOL AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION TO EXECUTIVE ALLOWED IS YOU KNOW I HEAR A LOT FROM NONPROFIT BUILDERS EVEN FOR PROFIT BUILDERS THAT THEY WANT TO OBVIOUSLY DO SOCIAL GOOD RIGHT BUT TO BE ENVIRONMENT OR FOR AFFORDABILITY GOALS BUT- GOING COMPETE COMPETING IN KIND OF A BYZANTINE GRANT PROCESS. IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST CONDUCIVE SUCH FOR THEIR TIGHT TIMELINES IN ANY DEALER PROJECTS HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED ANY. APPLICANTS BEFORE LIKE THAT PROBLEM WHERE THEY FEEL THE TIMELINE THAT THINGS DON'T MATCH UP WITH THEIR DELIVERY TIMELINE. WELL SURE THE TIMELINE IS TYPICALLY ONE OF OUR OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND THE APPLICANTS BIGGEST CHALLENGE. WE INCENTIVIZE READINESS AND MOST OF OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT EACH CD SO WE ASK THAT THE DEVELOPER HAVE. EVERYTHING IS READY TO GO AS POSSIBLE. AND YESTERDAY AS WE MAKE THE AWARD- WE ASK THAT THEY- BREAK GROUND WITHIN TWO YEARS WHICH WHICH IS SORT OF WITH AND ARE DEFINITION OF SHOVEL READY THAT. IF THEY CAN IF THEY CAN START TO GET INTO YEARS ARE PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. RIGHT AFTER THAT THIS IS THIS MAKING HER TO BE ON THAT ON THE POLICY SIDE IS. JUST A REMINDER THAT WE ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN HOW THE PRIVATE MARKET- DEVELOPED HOUSING AND SO TOOLS LIKE OUR HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY UNIT. ARE THERE- TO HELP SPEED UP- HOUSING ACROSS THE SEAT HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING THROUGH- ONE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING PROGRAMS. SO IF WE CAN INTERVENE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS INCREASED DENSITY CAPACITY NEAR JOBS TRANSIT AND RESOURCES IF WE CAN WORK WITH CITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE APPROVAL PROCESS THESE. ARE HAPPENING BY RIGHT AND AREN'T EXPEDITED TIMELINE THAT IS GOING TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER UNIT AND PERSONAL RESULT IN INCREASED OF. AFFORDABILITY EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SO THAT'S AND THAT'S ANOTHER ROLE WE PLAY OUTSIDE OF THE DIRECT FUNDING AND THAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY STATEWIDE. ABSOLUTELY TALK ABOUT CARROTS AND STICKS THAT YOU ACCOUNTABLE UNIT IS A GREAT STICK I THINK TO GET MORE OF OUR- HOUSING GOALS DONE. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS MEASURE. Q- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR DOCTOR CONSULT- YOU READ MADE A COMMON ABOUT- FINDING WAYS TO. DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S REFERRING TO SORT OF THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME OR WHETHER YOU HAD SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT. OH SURE OF COURSE I WAS REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT. IN THE ALREADY BUILT ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE LOTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE WATER WE HAVE POWER WE APPROACH WE HAVE ALL OF THESE OTHER THE TRANSPORTATION. AND IF WE'RE ARE CONTINUING TO GO TO THE URBAN FRENCH WE HAVE TO BUILD ALL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE LOOK THAT IS INTENSELY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- THERE'S A LOT OF EMBEDDED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ALL THAT NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT IS A KIND OF WASTEFUL WAY TO- TO APPROACH DEVELOPMENT SO IN THE SENSE OF ADVERTISING WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN THERE- WE MAY NEED TO- IMPROVE SOME OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IN FACT. IT'S ALREADY THERE AND SO WE MIGHT AS WELL USE IT THROUGH- TO PUT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE NEED FOR DENSIFICATION. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION. OF LET ME GO BACK TO ME MS KIRBY AND MISTER SHIELDS HVE A FEW QUESTIONS- MY QUESTION IS. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR ROLE AS A HOLDING MUNICIPALITIES ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU MENTIONED THE CARROT AND STICK APPROACH DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STICK IS IT IS IT WORKING. I NEED BUTTON. OF MET A- I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF WE HAVE AN ASPECT- YOU KNOW THAT'S FOR MAYBE A LITTLE NEW WANTS DOES COME IN IS WE DO- WE DO TRY TO ASSUME THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AREN'T DOING THE WRONG THING ON PURPOSE WE WERE CAUGHT START FROM A FRAME OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- BUT YES WE DO HAVE A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP NOW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THEIR HIGH HOUSING STRIKE FORCE AND WE DO HAVE. WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY- TO REALLY BRING THAT TO BEAR- WE ARE WORKING TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY THERE I WILL SAY AS WE- GET INTO THE DETAILS OF A LOT OF THESE. I'M A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS AND- YOU KNOW THAT- THESE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES- I HAVEN'T. BUT I THINK WE LEARN MORE EVERY TIME WE DO ONE OF THESE AND I THINK THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LEARNING MORE AS WELL- SO WE- I THINK. I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE THIS WORK BUT AND YOU KNOW WE TRY TO MAKE OUR- GET OUR INBOX AND VERY PUBLIC- SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING PROJECTS APPROVED CAN COME TO US- AND HELP US WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS WITH THEM. AND WE WERE DUE TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO NEED TO MAKE A LOT OF- DEVELOPMENT AVAILABLE BY RIGHT- SO THAT THE WORK CAN BE DONE UP FRONT AND THEN PROJECT APPROVALS CAN BE DONE AND EXPECT IT WAY. THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S TO LINK TO A POLICY GOALS HERE AT WORK ONE IS TO CREATE HOUSING. ND THE OTHER ONE IS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THAT THE HOUSING PIECES WHERE MOST OF THE TALK OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE STICK COMES IN DO YOU ALSO USE THAT FOR THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY SIDE IN OTHER WORDS HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT. ENFORCING ON COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SPRAWLING OR ENFORCING- SOMEHOW WE'RE TALKING TO COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T ALLOW COMMERCIAL ANYWHERE IN THE RESIDENTIAL AND- I DON'T GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO. THERE ARE NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY FOR INSTANCE THE GOAL OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED US SOMETIMES WILL USE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE BUT BE ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL SAME GOAL- ONE OF OURCORE TENETS IS AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING AND THAT'S ABOUT OPENING UP ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES WHICH MEANS- ENSURING THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE I WILL MULTIPLE KINDS OF HOUSING TYPES. NEAR THE NEAR JOBS NEAR TRANSIT YOUR RESOURCE SAYS SO EVERY SINGLE JURISDICTION THE STATE IS IN SOME. SOME PORTION OF THEIR HOUSING PLAN PREPARATION WITH US AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE SHOWING US AS PART OF THEIR I WOULD BUT THAT'S FOR KIDS. THAT HAVE TRANSIT OR HAVE THE JOBS BUT DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THOSE BEDROOM COMMUNITIES THAT A SO INSTEAD OF. ASKING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE TRANSIT TO ADD MORE HOUSING DO YOU EVER ASK THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ALL SINGLE FAMILY TO MOVE COMMERCIAL INTO THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND THAT WAY. NOT NOT THAT WAY SPECIFICALLY I'LL SAY. I'LL SAY THE WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT THAT IS- AND WHAT IT WAS YOU CAN SEE OUR WORK IN THAT AREA. IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE HOUSING NEED GOALS WERE SET. AND THEY ARE STEP BY OUR EXPECTED GROWTH PATTERNS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE PENT UP DEMAND INCLUDING VACANCY. LOW VACANCY RATES HI OVERCROWDING RATES IT'S ADDRESS THERE ARE WORLD COMMUNITIES WHERE THEIR HOUSING NEEDS WENT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY SO YOU KNOW PLACES LIKE ALPINE COUNTY. I GOT THE MINIMUM HOUSING GOAL THEY CAN GET WHICH IS TO FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING GROWTH EVERYWHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING BREATH WHERE IT'S NEEDED- BUT- ALL STATE. HOUSING I HOUSING IS NEEDED EVERYWHERE IT'S ABOUT- CREATING A SITUATION WHERE IT ISN'T ACTUALLY HARDER TO BUILD AND SELL. AND THEN TO BUILD OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING AND I WOULD SAY THAT COMMUNITY OPPOSITION REALLY PREVENTS THAT FROM BEING TRUE RIGHT NOW WE'RE BACK ON THE HOUSING DISCUSSION BUT GOING BACK AGAIN TO THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES DISCUSSION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CREATING HOUSING RIGHT IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING. WAYS OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN AREAS MAYBE THAT ARE EVEN MORE BUILT OUT. BUT IF ALSO THAT RECOGNITION IS THAT BECAUSE OF AN EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS YOU HAVE SOME AREAS SOME OF OUR- LESS ARE MORE AT CHALLENGED AREAS OR TYPICALLY UNDERINVESTED AREAS. THAT HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF MORE DENSITY AND MORE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEARS. THEY ALSO TEND TO BE THE AREA SET UP THE TRANSIT IN THE JOBS OFTEN. SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE STILL CAN OUR CONTINUING IT'S NOT A BAD THING BUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO TRY TO OPEN UP MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE AREAS FOR EVEN MORE HOUSING. BUT IN SOME WAYS THE AREAS THAT FOR A LOT OF THOSE REASONS THAT WAS CITED BY THE PROFESSOR AND THE FIRST PANEL. DIDN'T DO THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS.% YEAH WE ARE NOT ASKING THEM TO BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE FOR INSTANCE BY ALLOWING MORE. COMMERCIAL USES IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ONES THAT WERE DO SO VEHICLE MILES. YOU KNOW THE GROCER THE LITTLE BODEGAS. DAY CARE CENTERS ALL OF THOSE USES THAT WOULD. KEEP PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO THEN TRAVEL INTO THOSE DENSER AREAS RIGHT. SO DOES IT DO YOU LOOK AT WAYS OF TRYING TO. CHANGE THE WAY THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE PLANNING TO ALLOW THAT ARE YOU ACTIVELY INVOLVED YEAH THAT SPACE TO. YES AND I DID MISUNDERSTAND THE QUESTION FIRST SO I APOLOGIZE BUT YES THAT IS THE OTHER COURT SIDE OF OUR COIN AND THAT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS PART OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS THIS TIME SO ALL OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS YOU'RE SPEAKING UP WOULD NEED TO TALK TO US ABOUT THEIR PLACE BASED STRATEGIES- THAT THEY- THAT THEY ARE DOING IN THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE THAT- INCREASE THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCREASE THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- AN ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THOSE GOALS YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO SO IT'S NOT. ALWAYS GOING TO BE HOUSING SOLUTIONS IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A MATCH A MATCH COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO THE PLACE WERE WERE EVALUATING I'D LIKE TO AYE THAT'S GREAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT AND I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING THAT. AND HOW YOU'RE MEASURING THAT AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COMMUNITIES- THE COME IN EITHER WITH THEIR UPDATED HOUSING ELEMENT OR THEY DON'T AND JUST HOW YOU DO THAT BECAUSE I REPRESENT A LOT OF BEDROOM COMMUNITIES AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MOVEMENT AT ALL TOWARDS ANY OF THAT LIKE NONE. SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOUR YOU KNOW I HAVE TO TELL ME NOW BUT KIND OF WHAT YOUR PARENTS ARE FOR TRYING TO- CHANGE THAT. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE CONNECTING COMMUNITIES IN THE HIGHWAYS TO BOULEVARDS PROGRAMS AND IT GOES A LITTLE BIT BACK TO THAT EQUITY PIECE ABOUT HOW YOU REACH OUT- SPECIFICALLY TO. MUNICIPALITIES AND NGOS AND PARTICULARLY TO UNDER SIR ARE YOU KNOW TRADITIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS AND WHETHER YOU HELP THEM- MAKE THOSE APPLICATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN. HOPEFULLY BRING HOME. SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. GREAT QUESTION CARE AND YOU KNOW THAT THE- I'LL START RIGT I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FRONT HOWEVER YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT OF GROUNDWORK AND PRESIDENT PARTY SAID THAT WE CAN BUILD OFF OF PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT THE WORK. BUT AS CHEESY AS BEEN ABLE TO DO ON THE TRANSPORT OF CLAMOR COMMUNITIES PROGRAM- THAT THAT HAS- CRITICS. ARE GROUND UP APPROACHED AND DEMANDED HER APPROACH TO THE- PROGRAM CHEN IS PROJECTS THAT ARE- COME OUT OF THAT PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO A LOT OF THEIR BEST PRACTICES. AS WE BUILD AS WE BUILD THIS PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH% IT HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NAME I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE THE SAME TYPE OF. ART YOUR POINT KIND OF COMMUNITY DRIVEN- APPROACH THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WORK AND THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM AND BUILD BUILD OFF OF THEIR- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A- IT'S WORK THAT WE'VE ALSO DONE- AT. CAL STARTED THROUGH CALTRANS OF PROGRAMS LIKE THE TRANS INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM SO WE HAVE SOME- EXISTING EXPERTISE ON THOSE FRONTS BUT- IT WILL BE. A MUCH. BIGGER AND YOU UNDERTAKEN FOR US. THANK HAVE A QUESTION FOR- WHICH IS HOW CALLOUS TO. INSURE TRADE. IN DECISIONS ALIGN WITH THE GOALS OF CAP T&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND THE&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW YOU MEASURE THAT AND I'M GOING TO ASK ACTUALLY EVERYBODY AFTER THIS A QUESTION ABOUT METRICS AND- MEASURING SUCCESS AND EVALUATING- THESE GOALS. AGAINST WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT THERE IN IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY SO I'LL START. WITH KALISTO AND ASK ABOUT THAT. GREAT GREAT QUESTION AND YOU KNOW SO PART OF- CAPPED ISLAND WHAT WE COMMITTED TO IN THE PLAN CAME OUT WAS THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING OUT AN ANNUAL REPORTS WHICH IS DUE OUT THIS FALL- ON OUR- IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AND HOW FAR. WE'VE GOTTEN AND I WILL BOTH ALSO YOU KNOW- LOOK AT BOTH. A SPECIFIC ACTIONS AND WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BUT ALSO INCLUDE METRICS AND MEASUREMENT OVERALL HOW OUR INVESTMENTS ARE BEING INFLUENCED. BY THIS FRAMEWORK SO WE DO PLAN TO- YOU KNOW MEASURE THINGS LIKE- IN A VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND GIGI OUTLETS FOR PROJECTS AMONGST OTHER METRICS FOR. INVESTMENT SUITE- THAT WAS INCLUDED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF CAP DIED A YEAR OVER YEAR TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE COMMITTED TO THAT. THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND BE PART OF OUR REPORT THIS FALL. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW IT THE- PUSH TOWARDS BUILDING EFFICIENCY AND- I AM VERY GLAD THAT SOMEONE BROUGHT UP- CAL GREEN- WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY IMPACTFUL- AND OF COURSE ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES IS A HUGE PART OF OUR CLIMATE STRATEGY. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T FORGET THAT REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED- THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS SINGLE PASSENGER VEHICLES IS NOT ONLY NOT SUSTAINABLE AND LEAD TO A LOT OF BAD PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES IN A LOT OF TIME SPENT IN TRAFFIC. IT'S ALSO THE REASON IS WAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT EVERYBODY DOESN'T WANT DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC IN THE CARS SO YOU KNOW IN SOME WAYS ALL OF THE GREEN CAR INFRASTRUCTURE WERE DOING. IS A LITTLE BIT AT ODDS WITH THEIR GOALS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AND TO HAVE MORE LIVABLE COMMUNITIES IN A FIFTEEN MINUTE CITIES SO I'M ALSO WONDERING HOW WE EVALUATE THOSE INVESTMENTS AGAINST OUR GOALS OF. SHIFTING PEOPLE OVER TO MORE SUSTAINABLE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND MORE MORE SUSTAINABLE CITIES SO I DON'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS YOU OR MISTER SHIELDS WHO TALKED ABOUT THOSE- ELECTRIC VEHICLE- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WHAT I'M WONDERING I GUESS FOR BOTH OF YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BALANCE. THAT GOAL WITH THE GOAL OF NOT HAVING PEOPLE ON SO MANY CARS. GREG ABBOTT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW BROUGHT BROUGHT THE- YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO. WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S MORE GERMANE TO TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS. SURE HAPPENED A NUMBER IN AND THEN- IF CREDIT RATING ADEQUATE- ON ON OUR END I THINK- YOU KNOW IT. IT IT. WE DN'T NECESSARILY SEE IT AS AS AS A COMPETING INTERESTS IT'S BECAUSE- BOTH CAN BE PURSUED ONLY AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT HAVING. NEGATIVE IMPACTS- ON ON EACH OTHER YOU KNOW I THINK- THE REALITIES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD FOR DECADES TO COME SO THE PUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE- AT CALS AND STRESSED THAT IT THAT IT- THEY NEED FOR SHIFTING OF MODES IN. A MONTH SO WE TRAVEL AND REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING NEEDS TO BE NEEDS TO BE A CENTRAL PART OF THE CONVERSATION- S. MEMBER STATION WHAT DO YOU HOW DO THAT TRANSLATE THAT INTO ACTUAL INVESTMENTS. HOW DO YOU WONDERING HOW YOU BALANCE ALL OF THAT. YEAH I THINK I THINK WHAT MAKES ITS- FRANKLY LITTLE EASIER ON OUR END IS THAT THE DOLLARS MINUTES VETS- GO TOWARDS. THEY WERE SERVING ONE PERSON I'M SURE- ADDS A KIND OF A TRADITIONAL TRNSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TEND TO COME FROM DIFFEENT SOURCES SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A DIRECT KIND OF DATED A COMPETING- AT INTEREST IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF A DECIDING UPON WHAT TYPE OF PROJECT OR OVER ANOTHER GROUP FROM A KIND OF A- ACTED WILL. HOW YOU KNOW IT- IN THINGS LIKE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO REDUCE- VEHICLE TRAVEL AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ISN'T- EIGHT GOAL THAT THAT WE NEED TO. TO HAVE GIVEN THE IMPORTS OF RATES- MOVEMENT OF THE STATE BECOMES INCREDIBLY CRITICAL TO MAKE THAT BRIGHT IT'S CLEAN AS POSSIBLE SO THEN THAT THAT IN THOSE INSTANCES. THE BUT I KIND OF THEIR MISSION- VEHICLE COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT- BECOMES KIND OF THE CENTRAL POINT OF WHAT WE LOOK FOR- BUT ANOTHER ALL OTHER CASES YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN- IS- THE MONSTER AND ARE PROJECTS AND THEN WE YOU KNOW ARE ENCOURAGING WORK WHERE IT'S A PROGRAM FOR APPLICANTS TO LEVERAGE- OTHER DOLLARS FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE- EFFORTS AND- MOST OF THOSE DOLLARS DON'T DIRECTLY COME FROM TRANSPORTATION. INFRASTRUCTURE OF SOURCES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT THE DEAL OKAY THANK YOU SEE IF MISTER SHIELDS OR MR KIRBY. YES I AM. OKAY TO STANDARDS DEPUTY COME ACROSS IS HERE AND I THINK HE CAN. SPEAK TO ARE YOU CHARGING. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN BECAUSE KRAUS DEPUTY DIRECTOR INSTEAD. I'M SAY- DURING OUR PUBLIC. FOR BUILDINGS AN OUTCRY FOR BETTER ACCESS TV CHARGING AND THESE ARE RELATIVELY LOW COST. I AM VERY COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS IN EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS. RESIDENT THE MULTI FAMILY DWELLING TO PLUG IN THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAN PART AND THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED TO US THAT. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY PEOPLE- IN MUNICIPAL AREAS- NEED ACCESS TV CHARGING BUT ALSO THOSE THAT DO LIVE. IN MORE RURAL AREAS AND HAVE A LONGER DRIVE TIMES THAN THAT AND THE FACT THAT THEY NEEDED ACCESS TO THE- TV CHARGING. SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PURCHASE AND OWN AND DRIVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE SO- WE'VE RESPONDED TO THAT- IN PROPOSED SUCCESSFULLY- ADDING SIGNIFICANT. ACCESS TO EACH ARTICLE BY ADDING. 25% OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE PARLIAMENT. WOULD HAVE MANPOWER LETTER TO RECEPTACLES. APPROVED BY THE COURT PLAN IMPROVE AND THEN I SAW A FIVE PERCENT- PROVIDER PROJECTS WOULD HAVE. HIGH POWER LEVEL TO TRY TO GET IT. INSTALLED AND AVAILABLE FOR RETIRED. WHETHER OR NOT THE. CONFERENCE AND I WOULD YOU I TO KYLE'S COM THAT FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT I JUST CRIED. WELL FINE OUT YOU TO CHARGE INTEREST. OKAY. THANKS NOW AGAIN LET ME ASK ALL OF YOU WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER ABOUT METRICS TO EVALUATE THESE INVESTMENTS IN THESE PROGRAMS- BUT WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO HAVE IN PLACE AND HOW CAN YOU EVALUATE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND SO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TO SORT OF REPLICATE THEM WERE TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE FINDING WHERE TO CUT BACK ON FUNDING- BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW DOZEN GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL AND I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU I MEAN ALL OF US WHO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIND THAT A LOT OF TIME SOMETHING SEEMS REALLY OBVIOUS AND YOU PUT MONEY INTO IT BUT- GOING BACK AND FINDING OUT WHETHER IT REALLY. ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS- IS DIFFICULT FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF HAVING A LOT OF AB CHARGERS OUT THERE BUT DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE BEING USED- DO WE KNOW THAT- OUR INVESTMENTS IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND ARE BEING USED AND IF NOT WHY NOT SO HOW HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO AND EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS SO THAT WE SPEND EVERY DOLLAR WISELY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT AND SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE THOMAS FROM CALIFORNIA CITIES ACROSS COUNCIL AT. THE COUNCIL HAS A MANDATE TO PILOT THE NEW AND INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO OFFER AND- WHICH WE HAD EMAIL WE SHOULDN'T TO THE TCC. MIGHT BE HELPFUL. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN OF THE- WE INCLUDE THAT YOU FOLLOW SHOULD AS A PART THE MAGIC PART OF THE- PROGRAM. WHICH IS REQUIRED ALL THE APPLICATIONS TO SEPT THE SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT FORTY PROBABLY SHOULD DROP THEY TIRED AND GRUMPY. AND WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE LOSS CAN CENTERS TO DESIGN AND YEAH YOU SHALL SET OF METRICS THAT'S WILL BE TRACKED ACROSS ALL THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE PROVIDE. AND WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THIS RESEARCH ENTITIES TO MEASURE NOT THE WORSE IS THAT ANY CONTROL CYCLE YOUR BODY THAT YOU CAN SEE PROGRESS NOTES ARE REALLY HAVING AN IMPACT. THROUGHOUT THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RESEARCH ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE. NOTICED A LOT OF THINGS OF QUESTIONS IN THE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE UPDATED OUR GUIDANCE REFLECTS DOES IT NOT ONLY INCLUDES THE- REQUIREMENTS OF OUR GUIDELINES BUT ALSO HOW AUSTIN'S IN THE STATE APPROACHING THE SLAB. INVESTMENTS AND. HOW WE CAN BETTER PROVIDE SERVICES TO. OUR RESIDENTS AND CAL. IT HAS BEEN. THE SUCCESSFUL PARTNERS THAT COULD IS THE AND THE US BE PROVIDED BETTER SERVICE THAN- THAT'S CAN TO DO THAT BECAUSE PRO OF ITS YOU SEE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WANT TO WAS A GREAT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. I CAN I CANGO QUICKLY A COUPLE FOR US THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE LAND YOU SIDE- ONE IS WE NOW ON THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS CYCLE. I'M JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO PROVIDE US THEIR ZONING IN A STANDARDIZED FORMAT SO WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. I'M TO MAP ALL OF THE ZONING BETS I'M DONE AS PART OF THE HOUSING PLANNING PROCESS. I'M AND- I'M JURISDICTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THAT DOWNING WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT DUE DATE FOR LATER SECTIONS THEY NEED TO COMPLETE THAT'S OWNING. I'M BY- JURISDICTIONS THEY DIDN'T FINISH THE HOUSING ELEMENT ON TIME ONLY HAVE A YEAR TO COMPLETE THAT ZONING SO WE SPEED UP THE ZONING- AS THEY'RE SORT OF CONSEQUENCE FOR BEING LATE. I'M SO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH BACK DOWNING IS FOR EXAMPLE IN EXISTING LOW EMT COMMUNITIES OR NEAR TRANSIT- BUT ALSO IN- KIND JOB. CENTERED PLACES I'M LOOKING AT THAT IDEA WAS TALKING ABOUT OF INTENSIFYING LAND USE NEAR JOBS NOT JUST NEAR TRANSIT- SO THAT THAT'S A PIECE OF IT AND THEN EVERY SINGLE JURISDICTION NEEDS TO PROVIDE. I'M PROGRAMS WITH METRICS- AGAIN TO EAT BOTH THE INCREASING INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY SIDE AND THE PLACE BASED STRATEGY SIDE THAT'S THE KEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SITES OUT. EACH JURISDICTION HAS A SET OF- PROGRAMS THAT WE MONITOR AGAINS I'M AND SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THOSE INDIVIDUAL METRICS AND TIMELINES. I'M THROUGH OUR HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY UNIT TO ENSURE THAT- JURISDICTION- CIRCLED INTO THAT CONTRACT. COMMITMENT WITHIN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT. HE YOU. SO THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL- WHICH IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS AND METRICS FIRST WE HAVE ANY WAITING FOR THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CAPPASITY BUILDING AT THE GREEN LIGHTING INSTITUTE AND ANTOINETTE MAYOR SENIOR DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL PLANNING FROM SANDAG AND SAN DIEGO WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GIVE ME ONE SECOND I'M TRYING TO SHARE MY SLICE- CAN SEE HERE. SURE THAT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS EMMY WINNING THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CAPACITY BUILDING WITH THE GREEN THEN IT'S A TWO WE ARE A RACIAL JUSTICE POLICY ADVOCACY AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATION OUT WORKING TO INTO THE LEGACY OF REDLINING AND I WOULD SAY OVER THE PAST DECADE MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ENGAGED AROUND CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES I'M REALLY ADVOCATING TO ENSURE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE POSSIBLE TO AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST TENDER RESEARCH COMMUNITIES. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO DESIGN POLICIES AND THAT CENTER COMMUNITIES AND DECISION MAKING SO THE TCC PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT- WEEK WAS SPONSORED AB TWENTY SEVENTY TWO AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATES PROGRAM WHICH IS A NEW PROGRAM FOCUSED ON CAPACITY BUILDING FOR FRONTLINE% COMMUNITIES I'M IN THINKING ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COUPLE COMMUNITIES I REALLY WANT TO HONE IN ON THE COMMUNITIES PIECE- AND THE NEED TO CENTER POLICYMAKING AROUND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES SHIPS OUT IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GONNA BE TALKING OF THE NEED TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FROM THE TOP DOWN. FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND THEN ALSO. EQUITABLE EVALUATION- SO- IF YOU JUST TO BROWN AS A BIT I THINK WE'VE HEARD OF THE BIT OF. THE HISTORY AND CREDIT PRACTICES THAT I'VE CAN. TO REDLINING RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION ON INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES. AT THE STATE NOW HAS A RESPONSE AND WE'LL- RESPONSIBILITY TO WIELD ITS POWER IN THE INTERACTION OF CORRECTING INJUSTICES. SO I'VE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THREE COULD NOT PATHWAYS HERE. NUMBER ONE IS TO BUILD A PATHWAY FROM COMMUNITY PLANNING TO TRANSFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTATION. I'M FROM THE TOP DOWN THE STATE MUST CHANGE AT ACROSS THE BOARD. COMMUNITIES NEED FUNDED TIME TO ESTABLISH SHARED VISIONS DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PRIORITIES AND- PURSUE PROJECTS. SO WE VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO INTEGRATE PLANNING GRANTS ALONG WITH. THOSE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. AND THEN THOSE THOSE PLANNING RESOURCES HAVE TO BE PAIRED WITH THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND FOR COMMUNITIES TO RECEIVE AT TO. FORWARD IN ADVANCE THERE- TRANSFORMATIVE VISIONS RIGHT COUNTERING DECADES OF DISINVESTMENT. ON AND ASSISTANCE REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE PRETTY LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IN OUR MOST UNDER RESEARCH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY THOSE COMMUNITIES. NUMBER TWO IS TO TREAT COMMITTEES A HOLE INTO MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS. SO COMMUNITIES NEED FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIFIED PLANS THAT CAN REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THIS REALLY LOOKS LIKE BOTTLING INVESTMENT TYPES- IN MUCH THE WAY THAT THE TCC THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM DOES. I'M SO THEY WERE REALLY RESPONDING TO HOLISTIC COMMUNITY VISION AS OPPOSED TO A MIX OF UNPLUGGING IT INVESTMENTS THAT COME FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND THE NUMBER THREE IS TO REMOVE FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS- PROGRESSIVE POLICY IN PROGRAM DESIGN ON ITS OWN IS NOT ENOUGH. WE ALSO REALLY NEED TO REFORM THE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATING FINANCING AND CONTRACTING PRACTICES. THAT CURRENTLY ARE SERVING ISRAEL BARRIERS AND SOUND PREVENTING COMMUNITIES FROM ENGAGING WITH STATE. INVESTMENT SOURCES AND A PBLIC POLICY. SO KEEP KIND OF EXAMPLE RECOMMENDATION THAT. I THINK IT'S COMING UP AND FOR A LOT OF COMMUTER D. AS IN THE NEED TO. THE PAYMENT OF GRANT FROM SOME STATE ARE JUST AND REMEMBER BASE. ON WHICH WE PRESENTS A CASH FLOW CHALLENGE FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND EVEN SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. MOST NONPROFITS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE A CASH FLOW TO SUSTAIN MULTIPLE MODES. OF OVERHEAD IN PAYROLL AND BEFORE GETTING REIMBURSED FOR. WORK AND STATE FUNDED PROJECTS TO REALLY URGING THE STATE TO PERMIT ADVANCE PAYMENT OF GRANT FUNDS- AND ALSO THINGS LIKE COMMUNICATION EXPENSES WHICH OFTEN ARE NOT PERMITTED. UNDER A LOT OF STATE PRINCE. AND THEN MOVE FROM BOTTOM UP AND STATE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO GAIN EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS TO TOOLS LEGALLY APPOINTMENTS FOR PATIENTS SO FOR US THIS WORK LOOKS LIKE INVESTING IN LOCAL LEADERSHIP. AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY THEIR OWN NEEDS AND VISIONS DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS BUILD SKILLS AND THEN ADVANCE THAT GRANTS POLICIES ARE PROJECTS- SO TWO PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS HERE- NUMBER ONE IS TO DEVELOP STRUCTURES FOR COMMUNITY DECISION MAKING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHAT ARE NEEDED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS IT REALLY OUR COMMUNITY VOICES CENTER ESPECIALLY IN THESE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS- CENTERED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEE THAT IMPACT THEIR LIVES. SO AGAIN HERE THAT THE TCC PROGRAM THAT WAS SPOKEN OF EARLIER REALLY DOES PROVIDE THE STRONGEST MODEL THAT WE HAVE SEEN. AT TCC PUTS COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP FIRST REQUIRED REQUIRING A COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE MODEL AND BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TECHNICAL pRESIDENTS. THANKS WE ENCOURAGE OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO FOLLOW THIS MODEL AND REALLY ADOPT MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATIVE. GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS. THE SECOND PC IS THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL EAGLES THAT CHANGE. SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT- THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COLLECTED IMPACT IS REALLY DEPENDENT THE BALANCE OF SEVERAL KEY STAKE TYPES- STRONG COMMUNITY ANCHORS SUPPORTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN COMMUNITY FACING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND THE BALANCE OF THE STAKEHOLDER TYPES IS CRITICAL AND WE THINK THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFYING SUPPORTING AND RESOURCING THESE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. SO REALLY QUICKLY IN THE COMMUNITY AND PER SIDE- YEAH THE NEED TO PRIORITIZE RESIDENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN PROGRAM DESIGN OUTREACH AND A GREAT SELECTION. OF MANY GREAT REQUIREMENTS- INSISTENTLY PRIVILEGED PRIVILEGE INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS OVER- WHAT GRASSROOTS MILLIONS AND AS MANY NONPROFITS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUSTAIN RECENTLY SCREENING EXPERIENCE- SO REALLY LOOKING FOR THE STATE TO MOVE TOWARDS MODELS OF CO GOVERNANCE FOR GOVERNANCE BY DIRECTLY BY A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SO THAT. THEY ARE THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS OF FUNDING- NUMBER TWO IS- YEAH THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT ARE KEY ACTORS IN ANY LOCAL INCONSISTENT. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A KEY PERPETRATOR OF LOCAL INEQUITIES LAND USE DECISIONS AND PLANNING PROCESSES. SO THE ENCOURAGEMENT HERE FOR THE STATE ADD TO SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT TO MORE MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE RESIDENTS. PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTICIPATE IN A COLLABORATIVE. PROCESS SEES. EASING THE BAR PROVIDE ROBOTS EQUITY STANDARD AND THEN LASTLY HERE- KIND OF THIS YEAH. FOR TECHNO ASSIST INTO- PARTNER- WHO I THINK CAN OFFER MUCH NEEDED CAPACITY MUCH NEEDED TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES IN THEIR IN THEIR VISIONS AROUND WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THAT LOOKS LIKE. BUT THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF TECHNICAL ASSITANCE AND VARIES WIDELY ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS SO WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE STATE A MUCH LARGER ROLE IN IDENTIFYING SUPPORTING AND RESOURCING THESE CRITICAL THIRD PARTY TO CHOOSE. AND THE LAST- YEAH MENASCO MINUTES- AT THE STATE MOVES TOWARD EQUITABLE PROGRAM DESIGN AND COLLABORATIVE GRANT T. TEAMS- WILL ALSO NEED TO START MEASURING FOR EQUITY SO HERE I WANT TO FOCUSING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING. OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS. EVEN WITH ROBUST PROGRAM DESIGNED STRUCTURE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT. IN REAL LIFE AND NOT JUST ON PAPER- OPERATION OPERATIONAL I THINK LAUGHTER GOVERNMENT'S JUST MUCH MUCH MORE COMPLICATED RIGHT- SO TO BALANCE POWER DYNAMICS AND CALIBRATE THE FUNCTIONING OF COULD MULTI STAKEHOLDER GRANT T. PARTNERSHIPS. LEADERS YOU'RE RECOMMENDING THAT STATE AGENCIES- FUND IN REQUIRED DEL DEVELOPMENTAL LEARNING AND EVALUATION OF THESE COLLABORATIVE GRANTEE PROJECTS. AND PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE- ON OUR OWN WITH- THIS KIND OF LEARNING EVALUATION AND FOUND THAT HAVING AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR FOCUSED ON EVALUATING FOR HARD TO MEASURE CONCEPTS LIKE EQUITY BY CONTRAST LAKE. IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN A FURY OF CHANGE. THAT TO BE ENORMOUS AND ARTSY PASTA IMPORTANT AND- REALLY HELPFUL- NEARING THE END OF MY TIME SO I THINK I WILL STOP THEIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL THROW THE SNACKING CARE. THANK YOU AND WE'LL COME BACK FOR QUESTIONS IN A MOMENT A NEXT. WE HAVE MS MEYER FROM SAN BACK. THANK YOU. TRYING TO SHARE A POWER POINT BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHARING IS ENABLED FOR ME RIGHT NOW. I AM SEEING A THUMBS UP FROM SOMEONE HERE SO MAYBE TRY AGAIN. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE MY SCREEN NOW YES. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANTOINETTE MY ARM THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL PLANNING AT SANT'AGATA SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCY FOR THE SAN DIEGO REGION. AND THE SAN DIEGO REGION CONSISTS OF EIGHTEEN CITIES AND THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGOAND STANDEX PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PLAN DESIGN- BUILT AND FUNDS TRANSPORTATION BUT PROBABLY- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THAT WE DO IS TO DEVELOP THAT FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATED LONG RANGE TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR THE REGION THIS IS REQUIRED. I'M TO GET STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO UPDATE EVERY FOUR YEARS AND DECEMBER RE BOARDED OPTED ARE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. REGIONAL PLAN THAT'S TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REGIONAL PLAN IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE PREVIOUS PLANS THAT THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IT'S IT LOOKS OUT THIRTY YEARS- AND IT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION HUNDRED SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION. HISTORICALLY HAVE DONE PRETTY MINOR UPDATES TO OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN WITH THE SAME THAT THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PLAN FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES- CONTINUE TO BE THAT THE RIGHT PLANS DESPITE THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS REALLY CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSPORTATION- AND IF WE WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO INVEST AND- ROADWAY CAPACITY INCREASING. PROJECTS SO WE STARTED FROM SCRATCH WE WENT THROUGH A VERY DATA DRIVEN PROCESS AND WE DESIGNED A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AROUND SIR THREE GOALS ONE WAS REDUCING CONGESTION BUT NOT BY EXPANDING ROAD BASE BUT BY PROVIDING. COMPELLING ALTERNATIVES TO THE PRIVATE ON AUTOMOBILE- ADDRESSING EQUITY BY INCREASING ACCESS AND THEN MEETING OUR STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES AND SPECIFICALLY- OUR STATE REQUIREMENTS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 19% PER CAPITA BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE HAVE WE HAVE A LAW WAY TO GO ACHIEVE GOALS TO AND THE SAN DIEGO REGION 12% OF LOW INCOME RESIDENTS LIVE WITHIN A HALF MILE OF FAST AND FREQUENT TRANSIT SERVICE. I MEAN THIS REALLY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND ARE ARE DRIVING ALONG WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIX THAT PROBLEM- INTEL WE HAVE COMPELLING ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING ALONE. AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE AN THE RECENT PAPERWORK FOR THIS HEARING THAT DIGITALIZATION- WAS CONSIDERED AT TOOL. FOR INCREASING SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITY TODAY IN OUR REGION WE HAVE A DIGITAL DIVIDE WE SAW FIRST HAND DURING THE PANDEMIC. HOW THE LOOK THE FAMILIES THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE UNCONNECTED AND UNDER CONNECTED I'M REALLY CUT OFF FROM SOCIETY. STARVATION THE PLAN FOR THE FIRST TIME INCLUDES A DIGITAL EQUITY STRATEGY AND ACTIONPLAN AS WELL THAT SEEKS TO GET ALL HOUSEHOLDS- ONLINE AND THE SKILLS AND TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM TECHNOLOGY. SOURCE STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING THE GOALS ON OUR PLAN IS WHAT WE CALL THE FIVE BIG MOVES THE FIVE BIG LIVES WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A COMPLETE. TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM- STARTING WITH A COMPLETE CORRIDORS COMPLETE WHERE TO WHERE'S OUR MULTIMODAL ROADWAYS THAT USED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE HOW THEY'RE USED BASED ON REAL TIME CONDITIONS AND THEY- THEY ADDRESS CONGESTION IN TWO WAYS FIRST THEY REALLY MAXIMIZE THE INVESTMENT IN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. BY CONVERTING GENERAL PURPOSE LANES THE MANAGED LANES THAT GIVE PRIORITY TO TRANSIT AND SHARED MOBILITY HIGHER OCCUPANCY MODES. AND THEN THEY PROVIDE THAT NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE HIGH SPEED HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSIT LEAD SERVICE SAYS- BUT DO PROVIDE A VIABLE AND COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR. FLEXIBLE FLEETS THIS IS REALLY BUILDING UPON THE POPULARITY OF HALFPENNY BUILD SHARED MOBILITY SERVICES WE'VE INCORPORATED- EVERYTHING FROM SHARED BIKES AND SCOOTERS TO MICRO TRANSIT. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WORKING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT EVENTUALLY THESE WILL BE- CONNECTED ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AS WELL. MOBILITY HUBS THIS REALLY EMBODIES THAT FIFTEEN MINUTE COMMUNITY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MOBILITY HUBS ARE CONNECTED COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE IS SAFE MULTIMODAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S EASY TO GET AROUND I'M WITHOUT A CAR AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING. OUR HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL- GROWTH INTO THE FUTURE AS WELL. AND THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS WHAT WE CALL THE BRAIN OF THE ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THE NEXT OPERATING SYSTEM THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE DATA THAT WE USE TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM IN A GREAT SERVICE AS PROVIDE BETTER REAL TIME. INFORMATION AND AGAIN THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A DIGITAL EQUITY STRATEGY TO GO ALONG WITH OUR PLAN BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS THE WAY OF THE FUTURE AND WE WANT EVERYONE TO BENEFIT. IN ORDER TO GO FROM THESE HIGH LEVEL CONCEPTS DOWN TO. ACTUAL TRANSPORTATION NETWORK WE WENT THROUGH. A PROCESS OF LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE WANT TO WE NEED TO MOVE AROUND THE REGION AND THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION TODAY- THE MAP ON THE LEFT THERE WITH THE PINKS AND PURPLES- IS POPULATION DENSITY THE DARKER THE COLOR THE MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE AREAS. THE BLUES THE MAP WITH THE BLUES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS THESE ARE REPLACEMENT CENTERS THIS IS WHERE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF JOBS ARE WITHIN THE REACH AND- AND ON THE MAP ON THE RIGHT USES- BOTH CENSUS DATA. AND CELL PHONE DATA- TO LOOK AT WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM TO ACCESS THESE JOB CENTERS. AND THEN WE DID THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS FOR YOU KNOW- ALL OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITY CENTERS- EDUCATION OUR MILITARY BASES WHICH WE HAVE QUITE A FEW IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION RECREATIONAL DESTINATION SO WE GOT A REAL GOOD SENSE. FOR WHAT- CONNECTIVITY'S NEEDS WERE AND THE SAN DIEGO EACH I. MEAN BEYOND LOOKING AT DATA LIKE THIS WE ALSO WENT THROUGH. A ROBUST OUT PROCESS WE PARTNER WITH AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY CAN HELP BRING THE SOCIAL EQUITY PERSPECTIVE TO US. GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND GET INPUT BACK TO LAST ON WHAT UNITY'S. NEED OUT OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO THIS ALLOWED US THAN TO- TRANSFORM THESE CONCEPTS INTO A COMPLETE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK STARTING WITH THE MOBILITY HUBS- ADDING IN OUR- COMPLETE CORRIDORS THE MANAGED LANES RAPID TRANSIT SERVICES. IMPROVING OUR LIGHT RAIL THAT EXIST TODAY SPEEDING IT UP. AND THEN ADDING COMMUTER RAIL WHICH IS THAT HIGH SPEED- SERVICE THAT- I'LL- WE DON'T HAVE IN THE REGION TODAY. BUT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE LONGER CONNECTIONS QUICKER FOR PEOPLE. AND THIS ALLOWED US TO NOT JUST MEET BUT EXCEED OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. ENDS OUR OUR HOUSING GOALS FOR ADDING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND NEW HOMES AND MOST OF THOSE HOMES ARE BEING ADDED WITHIN THOSE MOBILITY HUBS. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE- THAT A LARGE PART OF LOW INCOME MINORITY- SENIOR POPULATIONS- ARE LIVING WITHIN THOSE MOBILITY HUBS IN THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN THAN FIFTY PERCENTS- OF OUR SOCIAL EQUITY COMMUNITIES WILL BE AND I'M ABILITY HOUSES HAVE THAT ACCESS THOSE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. SO THIS IS- TODAY. WHAT ARE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION- AND YOU'LL SEE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'VE INCREASED THAT- SUBSTANTIALLY AND BY TWENTY FIFTY EVEN MORE SO WE GO FROM. NO 12% OF LOW INCOME POPULATION HAVING ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED TRANSIT UP 2401% MODE SHARE ALSO IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY- YOU'LL SEE AND THE TANK THERE THAT WE HAVEMORE PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US MANAGED LANES AND CARPOOLING AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PEOPLE TAKING TRANSIT WALKING AND BIKING- FOR THEIR COMMUTE. SO THAT IS THE END OF THE PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND HAVING MORE OF A DISCUSSION THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU IN SANDAG. NEVER DISAPPOINTS. YOU KNOW WHAT DO GREAT WAY TO END OUR PRESENTATIONS WITH A PLAN THAT RECOGNIZES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY. AND DOESN'T OVER EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRIFICATION OF TO THE TRANSPORTATION MODES BUT REALIZES THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT THAT'S NOT A TRANSPORTATION PLAN. AND THAT DOESN'T SOLVE ANY OF OUR OTHER ISSUES- I GUESS I WOULD ASK- YOU BOTH. ABOUT AGAIN- SORT OF METRICS AND EVALUATION AND I WOULD ALSO ASK WELL. LET ME JUST START WITH SAND ACCENTURE ON THE SCREEN- WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE THAT THAT YOU NEED- IN TERMS OF THESE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THE OTHER AGENCIES WHETHER. FINDING OUT ABOUT THEM ACCESSING THEM HAVING COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATE WITH YOUR STATE PARTNERS. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES I MEAN THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE ADMINISTERING THESE GRANTS WHETHER THAT'S HOW THAT'S BEEN GOING FOR YOU I'M NOT TRY TO PUT A ONE SPOT I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY PLACES THAT WE CAN. HELP AND IT TO IMPROVE. WELL I WOULD SAY WE HAVE- WONDERFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE TODAY- WE HAVE GRANTS FROM VARIOUS AGENCIES- WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON- GETTING RESOURCES TO OUR MEMBER AGENCIES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH THE STATE- AND SO- ALL OF THE AGENCIES. REUTERS TO STAND ACT- YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO- WE NEED A LOT OF FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR AMBITIOUS PLANS- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING- TO PARTNER AND- MAKE GOOD PROGRESS- ON OUR ARE VERY AMBITIOUS VISION FOR TRANSPORTATION- IN TERMS OF METRICS THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW CLOSE TO THIRTY OR FORTY DIFFERENT INDICATORS- AND WE ARE EVALUATING- OUR PROGRESS- AND PUTTING OUT REGULAR MONITORING REPORTS FOR THE REGIONAL PLAN BUT SANTA IS ALSO INVESTING IN AN OPEN DATA PORTAL SO THAT WE CAN MAKE- DATA THAT WE COLLECT AVAILABLE TO- THE PUBLIC WE WANT. YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY WE WANT TO SHOW- HOW WE'RE DOING- AND SO THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LAUNCHING THAT AT PUBLIC DATA PORTAL HERE PRETTY SOON. GREAT THANK YOU AND HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS WEIGHING FROM GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT US ASK THEM TOGETHER THE FIRST ONE IS THAT YOU HAVE UP ALWAYS GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS AND YOU. YOU ALL AS AN ORGANIZATION SPENT A LOT OF TIME REALLY ANALYZING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MAKING. VERY SOLID RECOMMENDED AND I'M WONDERING IF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GETTING ANY TRACTION OUT THERE DO. YOU FIND A RECEPTIVE YOUR FROM OUR AGENCIES WHEN YOU MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS SUCH AS HOW GRANTS ARE ADMINISTERED- WAYS OF CHANGING SERVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU THNK WE'RE PUTTING ENOUGH RESOURCES INTO TCC GIVEN THAT YOU'VE CITED SEVERAL TIMES AS A VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM SO THAT WOULD BE FOR I GUESS FOR EITHER OF YOU. YEAH HAPPY TO RESPOND TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I WOULD SAY THE CHALLENGE OF MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IS THAT- IT'S A DECENTRALIZED PROCESS RIGHT ALL THESE DIFFERENT BASKETS KIND OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES SO I WOULD SAY. OVERALL OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE FOUND INCREASING RECEPTIVITY TO THESE KINDS OF IDEAS AROUND AND THE NEED TO EMBED EQUITY AND OPERATIONALIZE EQUITY AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT BEING SAID- YEAH I MEAN THE STATE AGENCIES ARE A REALLY LARGE BUREAUCRACIES IT IS LIKE IT'S LIKE PUSHING AN ELEPHANT UP THE HILL- BECAUSE CHALLENGING TO WORK THROUGH NOT ONLY PROGRAM DESIGNED BUT ALSO SOME OF THE LIKE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS SEES. THAT I THINK MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR COMMUNITIES TO ADAM. TO WORK RIGHT AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE CITED TCC MANY TIMES- WE HAVE PROBABLY A VERY- YEAH WORKING WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IN PARTICULAR- AS AN INTER AGENCY BODY AS AN AGENCY THAT I THINK IS. SMALLER AND MORE NIMBLE IS ABLE TO TAKE ON KIND OF MORE CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING AND THATIS WHY WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THAT AGENCY IN PARTICULAR AND ALSO THERE- ABILITY. TO THE STC COUNSEL TO THEN HOPEFULLY- PROPAGATE OUT SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE ON OPERATIONS IN EQUITY SO THAT'S TO THE FIRST QUESTION- YEAH LOTS OF CHALLENGES ENGAGING WITH STATE AGENCIES I THINK SOME FOLKS ARE RECEPTIVE I THINK SOME FOLKS ARE NOT. I THINK THE FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THE WORKING THROUGH THESE THESE LARGE PROPERTIES IS. NO SMALL pQUESTION- AROUND- TRANSFORM IT CONTINUES PROGRAM. I THINK THE RECENT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FROM THIS YEAR AS PROPOSED BUDGET AS WELL AS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ARE APPROPRIATE. WE'VE ALWAYS ENVISIONED TCC TO BE ABLE TO FIND CATALYTIC LARGE SCALE GRANTS ALWAYS ENVISIONED EVERY GRANT CYCLE WOULD HAVE THREE TO FOUR GRANTEES GRAB AWARD EATS. AND THE RECENT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS IN THE RANGE OF YOU KNOW A HUNDRED MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION I THINK ACHIEVES THAT. THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS OF FUNDING- WHEN AT TCC HAS NOT SEEN ANY. FUNDING OR HAS RECEIVED ONLY TEN MIN AND ALSO FIND. I'M BACK IN CONCERT. IN PAST YEARS- BEEN PRIMARY CHANNEL AND IS. A THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES- THEY'RE ASKING COMMUTER TO PLAY HOMELESS. FOR THEM. BUT THEN THE FUN SORTS ITSELF THE- THAT YOUR TEACHER BUDGET ALLOCATIONS ITSELF- DON'T HAVE CONSISTENCY BUILT INTO AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD FOR TO ME NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO COUNT. ITS RESOURCES HERE A YEAR. THANK YOU THAT IS VERY VERY HELPFUL SO I THINK I WOULD ASK IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STILL PARTICIPATING REMOTELY AND HAVE A QUESTION MAYBE TO TEXT ME OR SOMEHOW. SIGNAL US THROUGH ZOOM- AND IF I DON'T HEAR FROM ANYONE I THINK WHAT I'LL DO IS SAY THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL SO I DON'T SEE ANYBODY. TEXT ME RIGHT NOW. THEY SAY THANK YOU TO THE PANELS AND WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO- THANK YOU PANELS AND IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO MOVE UP TO THE MICROPHONE NOW THIS WOULD BE THE TIME. OKAY SEEING NONE DO WE HAVE ANYONE COMING OPEN THE PHONE LINES UP THIS WOULD BE THE TIME FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT BY TELEPHONE TO. GO AHEAD AND CALL IN AND WITH THAT I'LL ASK. IF THE PHONE LINES CAN BE OPEN. WE HAVE AN OPERATIC YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LEADING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON TODAY'S CALL YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU YOUR LINE NUMBER. AND WHEN YOU'RE LINE NUMBERS CALLED PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE PROVIDE LINE. DO YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU AND WE WILL GIVE THE PHONE- COLORS TWO MINUTES WHICH IS A 100% MORE THAN A NORMAL TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR. AND NINE ELEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES THINK HE'LL AND MEMBERS AND PRESENTERS FOR UPLIFTING THE NEED FOR EQUITY ACROSS TRANSPORTATION HOUSING LOCAL ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AS NECESSARY COMPONENT OF BUILDING. MATERIAL COMMUNITY- AND MODIFIED MEN WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY- ADDITIONALLY THAT WE DO NEED COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS REGIONS AND STATE GOVERNMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT EMBED ACCOUNTABILITY INTO PROGRAM DESIGN AND AT THE SAME TIME SUSTAIN LONG TERM POSITIVE PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS GOVERNMENT. HE CAN BE DONE TOGETHER AND THE NEED IS PARAMOUNT PROMISING STATE STRATEGIES LIKE AT THE ACT HAVE FALLEN SHORT IN PART DUE TO THE LACK OF COORDINATION AND ENFORCEMENT BETWEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MEANINGFULLY FUND CLIMATE RESILIENCE PLANNING AN ADAPTATION. COORDINATION AND MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES ADDITIONALLY THERE MUST BE EQUITY ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES THAT CS FRAMEWORK DOES NOT WORK FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES THE SCENARIOS. DEVELOPED VICTORY IS THE ANTI BY INVESTING IN TRANSPORTATION ONLY AND HIGHER DENSITY AREAS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY EFFORTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY CHALLENGED BY NPR'S ONLY INTERESTED IN SUSTAINING OUR PATHETIC WELL LIKE WE CAN FRESNO COUNTY'S CURRENT MEASURES THE OUTSKIRTS WITCHER- PRIORITIZING THAT WAY EXPANSION AND- IF YOU LOCALLY AND HELPFUL I COULD DEVELOPMENT PERSON TO LOCAL IN HOUSTON AND- EAT IT. ESPECIALLY THE SEPARATE HERE TODAY. NEED TO BE ON THE- OF CHALLENGE AND GUESTS AND DEADLY. DEVELOPMENT AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO GENERATIONS OF ECONOMIC AND HELP SACRIFICE. THE PARENT IN AREAS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE TOXIC INCLUDING LAND USE THAT CONTINUE TO BE CITED IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND ACTIVELY UNDERMINE THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO BUILD SUSTAINABILITY FOR COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. THERE'S ALSO A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE THE WORK OF FUNDED PROGRAMS. BY COORDINATING GOLD INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS. JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH. TO BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS PROGRAMS EXTREME HEAT INVESTMENT AND BUILDING OCCUPATION ALL OF WHICH NEED TO BE UNIFIED BY A COMMUNITIES VISION FOR TRANSFORMATION TO IMPLEMENT. FINALLY WE AGREE COMMUNITIES MUST BE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF COMMUNITY- TRANSFORMATION FROM PROJECT INCEPTION TO IMPLEMENTATION CAN NOT GET TO ENSURE BUY IN FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS. YEAH WHAT MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT APART. OKAY YES FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITY'S VISION OF SUSTAINABILITY AN ECONOMY AND THE ALL PARTY TO UNIFIED INVENTING VISION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO MUCH FOR YOUR CALL K. NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NINE THIRTEEN YOUR LONG IS OPEN PLEASE GO. AND THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. I WANTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR STREETS WERE ALL- YOU KNOW BASICALLY IN APPRECIATING THE CONVERSATION NOTHING HAPPENED YOUR RECORD LAND USE POLICY I'M NOT PART OF THE REASON THAT- WE KNOW WE'RE SUPPORTING BILLS FASHION NOT REALLY ENCOURAGED THAT BETTER LAND USE. POLICY INCLUDING THEM REMOVE THE- AND THAT- AND ALL- HI THE OTHER BILL THAT WE ARE WE ARE STARTING A LOT OF THE L. SIX Q. Q. ICHI THREE SEVEN BECAUSE- REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT ANYONE I WANTED TO THROW INTO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. THAT I WISH WE COULD TALK MORE ABOUT. THE FIGHT HE- IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT MAKES GOOD LAND USE POLICY AND I CRIME AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND A LITTLE WHAT THE DEFENSE ALSO MAKES GOOD LAND USE POLICY ON A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND- A LOT OF ARCADIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE- GOING FISCALLY- ARE NOT THIS WEEK'S OPENED. UP THE COUNTRY NOT THAT CALIFORNIA IS A MULTIMEDIA UNTIL HELLO I SMALL THIRTY YEARS- ACROSS THE LOW DENSITY SAID HE- BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF RESPECT A CHOIR CONSISTING. ALL. WHAT THE CITY IS THAT AND BANK I'M NOT ENCOURAGE ANOTHER LITTLE ON BACKPACKS ENCOURAGE. ANYONE IS LISTENING TO THE CALL. IF YOU WANT TO GO THE FINAL TO GO TO GO OUT LIKE THAT FISCALLY. THING TO DO. TO KEEP SMALL CITIES FIRE A LOT AND SUPPORT THEM THROUGH GOOD LAND USE. THAT IS ALSO READ TO THE- IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE THAT WAS JUST TODAY BY A GROUP OUT BY. OF. WE'LL TAKE SAW THE STRONG HOW. PRINCIPLES AND- THEM INTO HE IS. AND ALLOW. AT THAT HOW THE ATTACK THOSE ARE. KEEPER ORGANIZATION AND BRAWL. AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE AREAS THAT THE COURT- YEAH. STANLEY HOW NEIGHBOR. AND HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKING A- HOME. A LITTLE BIT MORE. PRODUCTIVE AND INTERNAL MAKE THEM MORE CREDIBLE CLIMATE THAT I THINK HE ME OUT. AND WOULD A LOOK AT THAT YEAH. YEAH STRONG YOU CAN ON THE DAY REALLY REALLY SOLIDIFIES THE IMPORTANT. IN- AND ECONOMIC THANK. BEYOND JUST BE MORE CLIMATE CHANGE AFTER THAT SEEMS LIKE OF THE CAR THAT. ALAKNANDA ON THE PART OF THE MOTHER. I REALLY DID A LOT DISCUSSION BE BY FAR. NEEDED IT COULD. BOTH TRIED TO BE. ON THE FISCAL. AND THE CLIMATE.
