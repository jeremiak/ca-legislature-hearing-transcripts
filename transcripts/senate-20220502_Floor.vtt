00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.709
ANNIVERSARY THE LOS ANGELES

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:47.612
RIOTS AND UPRISINGS WHOSE MEMORY

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.748
STILL LINGERS ON PARTICULARLY IN

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:50.682
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE LOS AND

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.851
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. I'LL A

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.686
SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN A

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:56.588
CALIFORNIA SUBURB WHEN THIS-

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:59.057
RIGHT OCCURRED I REMEMBER

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.058
WATCHING THE VERDICT COME DOWN

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:02.227
AND BEING SHOCKED BY THIS

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:03.962
WATCHING THE RIOTS BREAK OUT.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.364
AND I THINK FOR ME AS A KOREAN

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:09.401
AMERICAN. I WAS THE FIRST TIME I

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.436
REALLY STARTED UNDERSTAND THE

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.405
RADIATION FRUSTRATION HELD BY

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.206
OUR- BLACK COMMUNITIES OVER

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:16.942
CENTURIES OF HISTORY IN THIS

00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:19.110
COUNTRY OF SUBJUGATION. AND

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:20.946
SYSTEMIC RACISM. I AND I THINK

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:23.315
I'LL ALSO. RELEASED START TO

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:25.917
CONNECT THE DOTS ON ON HOW- THE

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:27.852
GREEN COMMUNITY. NEEDED TO BE

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.487
ENGAGED IN I THINK IS A LESSEN

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:31.222
THE MANY KOREAN AMERICANS TOOK

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:32.057
AWAY FROM THESE RIGHTS THAT. WE

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:33.725
COULDN'T JUST KEEP OUR HEADS

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:36.094
DOWN AND- FOCUS ON THE SUCCESS

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.529
OUR BUSINESSES ARE OUR OWN

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.731
DEALINGS THAT WE HAD TO

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:40.365
PROACTIVELY ENGAGE GET INVOLVED

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:41.800
IN POLITICS. AND BUILD

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.768
COALITIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:45.870
WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES- AND

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:48.006
THAT- I THINK WAS A LESSON THAT

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.240
EVERYONE TOOK AWAY AT THE RIGHTS

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:52.010
OF COURSE BECAUSE- UNTOLD DAMAGE

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.745
THAT WAS CONCENTRATED IN

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.447
KOREATOWN. AN ESTIMATED TWENTY

00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:56.748
THREE HUNDRED KOREAN RUN

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.984
BUSINESSES WERE DESTROYED- MANY

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.285
ENTREPRENEURS LOST THEIR

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:02.287
LIVELIHOODS ALL TOLD THAT LOSS

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.755
OF PROPERTY WAS ONE BILLION

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.690
DOLLARS- BUT THE STORY THE

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.258
UPRISING OF COURSE WASN'T JUST

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.994
ABOUT DAMAGES ARE LOOTING- IT

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.596
WAS- I THINK IT THE SEEDS OF A

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.365
DIALOGUE THAT HAS CONTINUED TO

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:15.266
THIS DAY BETWEEN. THE BLACK AND

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:16.801
KOREAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:17.869
LOS ANGELES AND AROUND THE

00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:19.571
COUNTRY- AND I WAS PLEASED LONG

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:21.873
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.041
THIS ROOM AND IN THE OTHER

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.142
CHAMBER. TO ATTEND A NUMBER OF

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.978
EVENTS WHERE WE REKINDLE THOSE

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.013
CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.147
AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:30.782
THINK ABOUT HAVING TODAY AS WELL

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.584
AT A TIME WHEN ANTI ASIAN HATE

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.452
IS- SOMETHING THAT DOMINATES OUR

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.688
HEADLINES. WHEN WE SEE WITH THE

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:38.423
GEORGE FLOYD IN SO MANY OTHER

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.225
INSTANCES OF SYSTEMIC ANTI BLACK

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.893
RACISM- I DID THIS PROBLEM

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.796
CONTINUES TO BE SYSTEMIC AND

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.398
ENDEMIC IN OUR SOCIETY- WE NEED

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:47.532
TO BUILD THOSE COALITIONS WE

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.933
NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.268
. AND S. YOUR NINETY SIX

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.504
MEMORIALIZES THE PAIN AND HURT-

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.572
AS AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTIVE

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:56.274
DIALOGUE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. I

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.175
THINK THIRTY YEARS LATER I THINK

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.544
MOST OF US WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:00.445
WE'VE MADE PROGRESS BUT THERE IS

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.279
STILL SIGNIFICANT WORK LEFT TO

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.148
BE DONE. AND I'M HOPING THAT

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:04.249
THIS RESOLUTION WILL SEND A

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:09.921
SIGNAL THAT. HATE I'M SO- A

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:11.089
SIGNAL THAT- THAT THAT WE TO

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:12.190
HAVE THOSE DIALOGUES- SIGNALED

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:14.459
HOPE IN REUKA. THAT WE THE

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.360
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUE CAN

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:16.394
CONTINUE TO REPAIR THE SCARS.

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:19.064
LEFT BEHIND BY RACIAL

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.598
ANIMOSITIES- THAT HAVE DIVIDED

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.733
OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.501

BECAUSE- THIS MAN- IT WAS. IF IT

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:16.354
DID NOT FOR THE FACT. THAT IT

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.689

IT COMES OUT AFTER AMERICANS.

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:44.249
AND THE DATE THAT THE VERDICT

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.584
CAME THROUGH. I REMEMBER I WAS

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:50.021

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:11.776
WAS AN INJUSTICE BY THE JURY.

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:13.444

TIME I MADE IT BACK TO GUARDIAN-

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.893

CAUCUS VICE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.020
NOTE THAT LATINOS ARE BRINGING

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:05.022
THEIR BEST TO CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:06.991
ARE BETTER FOR IT AMONG THE LIST

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:08.559
LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS FOR

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:11.528
EXAMPLE. THERE ARE SEVENTEEN

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:14.064
WOMEN LEGISLATORS AMONG THE

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:15.866
TWENTY NINE MEMBERS. BUT AS MUCH

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:18.869
AS LATINOS BRINGS CALIFORNIA.

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.739
CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAS NOT

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.974
ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR THEM.

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:27.278
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE FORCIBLY

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:30.514
STERILIZED LATINOS AS LATE AS

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.416
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:34.518
DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.654
STERILIZATIONS OF LATINOS IN OUR

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.555
STATE PRISONS TOOK PLACE EVEN

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:40.858
INTO THE TWO THOUSANDS IT WASN'T

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:44.361
UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT WE

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.931
BANNED THAT PRACTICE. PANDEMIC

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:49.066
IS ANOTHER CASE IN POINT. IN THE

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.502
FIRST YEAR THE PANDEMIC LATINOS

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:53.370
WERE THE BIGGEST DROP IN OUR

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.339
LABOR WORK FORCE OF ANY

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:58.042
DEMOGRAPHIC. MANY OF THEM LEFT

00:42:58.108 --> 00:42:59.610
THE WORK FORCE NOT ONLY BECAUSE

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:02.212
THEIR JOBS WORK SHUT DOWN BUT

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:03.247
ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAD

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:05.316
RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.184
FAMILY MEMBERS WHO NO LONGER HAD

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.920

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.922

HAS DROPPED OUT OF OUR LABOR

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.365
FORCE. MANY WHO'VE NOT YET

RETURNED. AND OF COURSE

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.336
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE SO MANY OF

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:26.537

THEIR FAMILIES. THAT'S WHY I AM

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:35.346
VERY PROUD. THAT WE IN THE

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:37.081
