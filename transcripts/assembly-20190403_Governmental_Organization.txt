THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR WELCOME PROCEED THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ON OCTOBER IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TUBS FIRE STARTED IN CALISTOGA AND IN FOUR HOURS. THIS WEB TWELVE OUT OF TWELVE MILES THROUGH CINEMA COUNTY AND INTO THE CITY SANTA ROSA. THE FIRE DESTROYED FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE STRUCTURES AND TOOK THE LIVES OF TWENTY TWO PEOPLE. NEARLY ALL OF THEM FROM COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. THE TIME WE FELT AS THOUGH WE JUST EXPERIENCE A ONCE IN A GENERATION TRAGEDY. SINCE THEN THE THOMAS WOLSEY CAR IN CAMP FIRES HAVE PROVEN US WRONG. WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE TUB FIRE WHAT WAS NOT A FREAK ACCIDENT OR THE PERFECT STORM. BUT THE PRODUCT OF A SYSTEMIC CRISIS. GENERATIONS OF CLEAR CUTTING FOREST'S FOLLOWED BY FIRE SUPPRESSION FOR BY COMMUNITY SPRAWLING INTO WILD LANDS ALL EXACERBATED BY A CHANGING CLIMATE. THIS IS PUT HUNDREDS OF TOWNS IN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THIS CRISIS CALLS FOR SWIFT BOLD ACTION AND A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. AND IT HAS TO START WITH THE HOMES THEMSELVES. AB THIRTY EIGHT PROPOSES A THREE PRONGED APPROACH FIRST WE ARE PROPOSING A LOT I KNOW OR LOW INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND. TO HELP PROVIDE RESOURCES TO HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT THEIR PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED HOMES IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. WE HAVE LIFTED MANY OF THE PROVISIONS FROM OTHER SUCCESSFUL LOAN FOR RETROFIT PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE SEISMIC SAFETY FINANCING PROGRAM. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STATE TREASURER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON HOW BEST TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. SECOND WE ARE WORKING WITH FIRE SCIENTISTS AND BUILDING ON MS FRIEDMAN'S AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN FROM LAST YEAR THAT TASK THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WITH IDENTIFYING LOW COST RETROFITS. RASKIN HOMEOWNERS TO CERTIFY THAT THESE RETROFITS OF TAKEN PLACE BEFORE AT THE TOP OF THE HOME IS SOLD. FINALLY WE'RE PROPOSING A STATE WILD FIRE PREPAREDNESS BOARD AND A NETWORK OF REGIONAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE PLANNING. EDUCATIONAL AND SOME AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CAPACITY TO FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THEIR ENTRY ENTITIES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA DOING GREAT WORK OF PREPARING COMMITTEES FOR FIRE. BUT IS EXCEPTIONALLY INCONSISTENT FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY. AND IS OFTEN THE CASE THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE FEWER THE FEWEST RESOURCES TO SPARE ARE GENERALLY LESS PREPARED. MEMBERS THIS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET IS TAKEN AS GENERATIONS TO GET INTO THIS SITUATION IT WILL TAKE US YEARS TO GET OUT OF IT. BUT I BELIEVE AB THIRTY EIGHT MOVES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HERE IN SAID TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL CAKE DARGAN. AND LIVED LIVES FORSBERG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THANK YOU I'LL GO FIRST I AM CAIT DARGAN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL I WANT TO COMPLIMENT ASSEMBLYMAN WOODS FOR HIS EFFORT TO DO A DIFFICULT TASK. UP I'LL TELL A SHORT STORY ABOUT HOW WE GOT TO THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODES IN TWO THOUSAND AND ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WE BEGIN A RESEARCH PROJECT AT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. TO DETERMINE HOW BUILDING SPECIFICALLY BURNT RELATIVE TO WILD FIRE THAT RESULTED IN FIVE TESTING STANDARDS WHICH WE THEN CONVERTED INTO THE FIRST EVER CHAPTER SEVEN A CALIFORNIA BUILDING -- CODE. WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING STANDARDS AT THAT TIME THOSE PROVISIONS WERE TARGETED FOR AT NEW CONSTRUCTION. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE ALL BECOME PAINFULLY AWARE THAT IT IS THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK THAT IS AT DIRE RISK A DISASTER FROM WILDFIRES. TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE WAY FORWARD AND THAT IS TO ADDRESS PHYSICAL CHANGE WITHIN THE ZONE THAT WE CALL THE STRUCTURAL IGNITION ZONE AND THAT PHYSICAL CHANGES CHANGING THE BUILDING ELEMENTS THAT ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO AMBER INTRUSION FROM WILD FIRE. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITY PROTECTION BUT TO GET TO BUILDING PROTECTION TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL HOMES FROM THE THREAT OF EMBERS INDIRECT FLAME WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE COMPONENTS OF THE EXCUSE ME OF THAT BUILDING. SO THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR RETROFITS ON THE OVER TWO MILLION HOMES THAT DO EXIST AS EXISTING HOUSING. STOCK OUT THERE IN THE STATE. AND YES IT WILL TAKE AWHILE IT IS A DIFFICULT LEFT BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THERE AND THAT IS TO CREATE BOTH A DEFENSIBLE SPACE OWN AROUND THE STRUCTURE. AND THE IMPORTANT BUILDING ELEMENTS SUCH AS WINDOWS VANCE ROOFING MATERIALS COVERED GUTTERS IT CETERA THAT PREVENTS THE INTRUSION OF EMBERS -- FOR THAT BUILDING RISK WITHOUT THOSE ELEMENTS DEFENSIBLE SPACE ALONE WILL NOT PROTECT THE STRUCTURE NOR WILL JUST VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP. IN THE RESILIENCY DEVELOPMENT FOR CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCED BURKE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY EIGHT LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA SAW THE WORST FIGHT WILDFIRES IN HISTORY SET A NEW RECORD FOR THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY US. IN THE FACE OF MAKE THE FIRES WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INVEST IN AND CREATE FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. WELL WE CAN'T STOP THIS PROGRAM PROBLEM OVERNIGHT THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE NEED TO INVEST IN IMMEDIATELY TO BETTER PROTECT PEOPLE IN NATURE IN THE FACE OF WILDFIRE. FORCED RESTORATION AND FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA MADE A ONE BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO FOREST HEALTH AND FEELS REDUCTION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WHEN YOU COMPARE BELOW INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY PROTECTION PROVIDED BY A. B. THIRTY EIGHT TO ADAPT OUR COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING THREAT OF FIRES? AND FOR COMMITTEES ARE ESTABLISHED IN HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE RESOURCES AN EXPERT WHO CAN HELP WITH FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. THE REGIONAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION DISTRICTS CREATED IN AB THIRTY EIGHT WILL ENSURE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL HAVE FIBER PREVENTION PLANS. AND ACCESS TO TECHNICAL OCT PARTIES IN ASSISTANCE TO IMPROVE FIRE SAFETY. LET'S STOP MAKING HISTORY AND START FIXING THE PROBLEMS THROUGH BOLD MEASURES LIKE AB. THIRTY EIGHT WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL -- TESTIMONY SUPPORT. CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ALL STATE INSURANCE AND SUPPORT. SINGLE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY DO WE HAVE ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION HERE TODAY. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS IN THE MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MISTER GIPSON SECOND FOR MISTER GALLAGHER. CORRECTION SECOND FOR MR SALAS. SIR WHAT I'VE -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU AGREED. TO A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS YES YES I HAVE THAT PERTAINS TO THE COMMENTS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT'S FIRST REMOVE THE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS SECOND TO REMOVE THE PROVISIONS -- DESIGNATE THE EIGHTEEN NEW REGIONAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION DISTRICTS OF STATE AGENCIES INSTEAD THEY WILL BE ADVISORY BODIES TO THE NEW STATE BOARD WITHOUT -- ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND THEN -- WILL ADD TO DIRECTOR CALLOW YES AND ONE APPOINTEE -- FROM BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TO THE NEW STATE BOARD IS MY UNDERSTANDING. I DO HAVE. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- ONE WE REFERENCE -- IN THE ANALYSIS. THE REQUIRING OF SELLERS IN THE FUTURE TO UNDERTAKE LOW COST RETROFITS AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT WORK VISION IS LOW COST RETROFIT SINCE THAT'S KIND OF AN AMBIGUOUS. TERM. I APOLOGIZE FIRST BY APOLOGIZE WE WE HAVE NOT AGREED TO REMOVING THE EIGHTEEN THE THE RETROFITS EXCUSE ME -- NOW. THE LONG WE'RE GOOD TO CONTINUE WORKING ON ON WE HAVE NOT AGREED TO REMOVE THE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS. OKAY WE SEEM TO HAVE A LITTLE CONFUSION THERE -- WHAT WE HONOR THE HEART OF THE BILL? WITHOUT THE RED RIVER REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO NEED FOR REVOLVING LOAN FUND. WALL -- TABLE THAT FOR THE MOMENT AND YOU AND I'LL WORK ON THAT GOING FORWARD -- AS A PERTAINS TO THE AND I WAS BELIEVE ME -- RE DIRECT YOU BACK TO MY QUESTION ON LOW ON LOW COST RETROFITS WHAT WHAT ARE WE ARE. WE LOW COST AND SOME COMMUNITIES IN SOME SEVERE TO SOME BUILDINGS IS. DIFFERENT. IN OTHERS SURE. EXAMPLES AND I COSTS ARE ARE FOR STATE FARMERS OR TO WIN AS WELL THINGS LIKE VENTS SCREENS -- SOFFITS GETTER GUARDS -- AND CREATING NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONES ARE ADJACENT TO THE HOUSE THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE LOW COST NOT TALKING ABOUT REPLACEMENT OF ROOFS. FOR CITING AND WE'RE TALK ABOUT LOW WITH ESSENTIALLY LOW COST. ANY OTHER. COMMENT I'LL MAKE SOME RIVER IN THE THIS GOES BACK A LITTLE BIT DISCUSSION OR DEBATE WE HAD OVER NINE A ONE LAST RECESSION -- I RAISE THE ISSUE. SEVERAL TIMES AND IN THIS COMMITTEE. ON HOW WE'RE SHARING THE COST THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THIS CASE FOR TIME A BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY WHICH OBVIOUSLY THAT -- BURDEN WILL BE SHARED EQUALLY ACROSS CALIFORNIA BY ALL -- TAXPAYERS -- SPECIFIC BACK TO THAT ONE DISCUSSION WAS MY CONCERN THAT YOU'RE DOWN AND FOR EXAMPLE MIKE TO BEING SUCH A VALUE WE HAVE -- A CLIMATE THAT REQUIRES LARGER HE'D YOUR HEATING COOLING BILLS AND THROUGHOUT YOUR GREAT STRUCTURE THAT COST IS SHARED BY EVERYBODY IS. BORN ON BY MY CONSTITUENTS AND COMMERCIAL OR DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS AND FIRE ISSUES -- WILL START TO SPREAD THOSE COST OUT ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN IN HOW WE HANDLE THAT NOT A CONCERN THAT -- ISN'T GOING. TO GET MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO RAISE IT WITH YOU AGAIN AS WE HAVE THESE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET. INTO SOME EQUITY -- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I'M DEALING WITH -- IT SPECIFIC. YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES FRANKLY TO OUR RESPECTIVE REGIONS. I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN IN MY DISTRICT -- WE HAVE VERY CLEAN AIR AND YET WE'RE SUBJECT. TO REQUIREMENTS BY THE A. R. B. THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN BECAUSE I HAVE POOR COMMUNITIES AS WELL SO SOMETIMES IN I I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE DO THINGS FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE STATE. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EQUITABLE AND I TRUST ME I TAKE A LOT OF VOTES ON A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE EQUITABLE FOR MY COMMUNITIES -- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S AN IN THE GREATER GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHARE IN COMMON PORTIONS OF OUR DISTRICT -- AND I KNOW YOU APPRECIATE -- ABSOLUTELY -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS OR ISSUES REMEMBERS MR BIGELOW. AND I I APPRECIATE DR WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WHICH IS A SAFER HOME AND AS A FIREMAN I CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- GOING INTO IT SOMETIMES THE PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ARTIST SAFE IS. WE'D LIKE THEM TO BE FOR THE FIREMAN AS ARE FIGHTING A FIRE -- BECAUSE IT DID CREATE SOME HEALTH OTHER ISSUES FOR THEM AND FINDING IT -- GIVEN THAT SAID. THERE HAS BEEN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS -- A POWER GIVEN TO THE LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE AND TAKE ACTION UPON PUTTING THESE OF BUILDING CODES IN PLACE. AND THEY HAVE AN ACTED UPON IT. SECOND FOLD IS THEIR CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVEN'T DONE THEIR BEST AT ENFORCING THE THE CLEARANCES AND AND THIS -- THE THAT THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO BE COMPLIANT TO BE FIRE WHY IT'S SO WE HAVE A HOST OF THINGS THAT THE LOCALS HAVEN'T DONE. ON THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE CURRENTLY. YOUR BILL MAKES A VERY. CHALLENGING THOUGH RIGHT NOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR PEOPLE LET'S SAY A DOCTOR WAS HAS ALWAYS AND RECEIVED AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN ANOTHER LOCATION. MAYBE IN THE STATE OR OUT OF THE STATE AND YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE DID YOU HAVE TO MOVE WITHIN. A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WITH THIS REQUIREMENT IN PLACE AND YOUR HAVE THE RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A CONUNDRUM. WHAT TO DO? HI HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK IS NOW YOU GOTTA HAVE A CERTIFICATE BEFORE YOU SELL IT AND YOU CAN'T SELL IT. UNTIL YOU'VE GOT ALL THE WORK DONE AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY OR THIS FUND DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE THE THE THE PROJECT DONE. AT APPRECIATE WORK APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM MY MY HOPE IS THAT THIS IS THE FUND WILL BE SOLVENT AND AND ARE. ADEQUATE -- AT THE TIME OF SALE THE HOUSE THERE'S POTENTIALLY MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE THAN THERE EVER WILL BE. SO -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE REALLY PRETTY LOW COST ITEMS LIKE I SAY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ROOFS WHEN I TALK ABOUT CITING? AND KEEPING YOU KNOW KEEPING THINGS AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE AT A COMBUSTIBLE -- CERTAINLY -- IT'S NOT AN EXPENSIVE THING TO DO NECESSARILY -- MAYBE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WOULD LIKE TO OUR FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL LIKE TO WIN THE AYE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT IT I STAFF. HOW MANY EXCEPTIONS DO WE DO WE PUT IN PLACE HERE OVER TIME -- AND TO END UP CREATING A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THAN WHAT YOU ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOUT YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT CITIES DON'T ENFORCE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT -- COUNTIES OR NOT AND FORCING WITH THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT -- OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE NOT ALWAYS DOING THAT AS WELL -- WE SHOULD AND AND WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES ARE ON THE BOOK AND PEOPLE NEED TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. BUY THEIR OWN HOMES NOT TRYING TO I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO CREATE SOME HEARTBURN FOR PEOPLE ON THIS I HAVE A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHY WE SET UP THIS FINE -- AND LIKE I SAID WHEN YOU GO TO SELL A HOUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE THAN YOU PROBABLY EVER WILL -- AND WE YOU KNOW WE WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S POTENTIAL CHALLENGE. WELL I I I APPRECIATE THAT I ANOTHER QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT TO LOW COST IS NOT WELL DEFINED INSIDE THE BILL. HOW DO WE REALLY REMEDY THAT BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU I'M IN THE PROCESS OF REMODELING AN EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE? TRYING TO DO THE HARDENING. AND IT'S NOT LOW COST IT COSTS A LOT BUT MARTY PLAYING ON IT IT COSTS A LOT TO PUT THE MUCH MORE SECURED SO YOU DON'T GET THE EMBERS INSIDE. THESE ARE A LOT OF WHAT'S THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND ENGINEERS HAVE TO PLAN OUT. SYSTEMATICALLY. AND NOT ALL OF IT IN FACT MOST OF IT IS NOT LOW COST. SO HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THAT LANGUAGE OF THE LOW COST. WELL AT THE STATE ARE OF THAT OUR FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL WEIGH IN ON THAT I KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT. YOUR HELP. I'LL START WITH YOUR FIRST QUESTION JUST -- I HAVE THE LUXURY OF BEING WELL INFORMED ON THE ISSUE. AND RETIRED. SO I CAN SPEAK AS FRANKLY AS I CHOOSE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE -- I GUESS I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY FOR THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES IN MY TESTIMONY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY FORWARD ON DEALING WITH THE RISK THAT EXISTING STRUCTURES FACE RELATIVE TO WILD FIRE AND THAT IS A CONCERTED EFFORT. TO ENABLE RETROFITS AND PROVIDE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT IS BOTH THAT IS A HEAVY LIFT IT WILL TAKE US YEARS IF NOT. I MEAN IT WILL TAKE US DECADES TO GET THROUGH THAT PROBLEM BUT WE MUST START SOMEWHERE THIS BILL IS A WORTHY BEGINNING EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE RETROFIT QUESTION AND ENFORCEMENT IS AN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY COMPONENT. AND ALL COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY BE LOCAL OR STATE OR FEDERAL SHOULD BE ENFORCING. THE RULES THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS WE HAVE HAD P. R. C. FORTY TWO NINETY ONE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOOKS FOR FIFTY YEARS YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE IN MY TESTIMONY TO OTHER COMMITTEES. THOSE PROVISIONS NEED TO BE FULLY ENFORCED AROUND THE STATE. RETROFITS MUST BEGIN. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PROTECT OUR HOMES WITHOUT TACKLING THIS ISSUE. RELATIVE TO LOW COST ALL GOOD PUBLIC PROGRAMS BEGIN WITH A PHASED APPROACH AND SOME CAPACITY BUILDING TO BEGIN THE PROCESS AND I THINK THIS BILL. CUES THAT UP WE ARE GOING TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY I THINK LOW COST UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A BENCHMARK. UNDERNEATH THAT FOR WHAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WITHIN THE LOAN I'M THROWING THAT OUT AS AN IDEA. BUT THERE ARE A FEW COMPONENTS TAKING DOWN THE LIST IN TERMS OF WHAT. IS MOST EFFECTIVE. AND THE COMBINATION OF A FIRE OR IGNITION RESISTANT ROUGH WHICH ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOFS OR BETTER MEET AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE DRAMATICALLY INCREASE A HOMES ABILITY TO SURVIVE. VANCE AND SOFT PROTECTION ARE THE NEXT ON THAT LIST AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE AFTER THAT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WOULD RECOGNIZING CONCUR WITH YOU THERE IS THIS A SERIES OF STEPS HERE TO ACHIEVE. A TRUE HARDEN -- ENVIRONMENT BUT EACH OF THOSE STEPS COMES WITH A COST. AND AS WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING DOCTOR WOULD MYSELF EVERY MEMBER HERE IS STRUGGLING STRUGGLING DESPERATELY WITH FINDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE PUTTING ANOTHER NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. WHICH IS MAKING IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE LUXURIES OF THE STATE NOW GIVEN THAT SAID IT ALSO IS THE OTHER CONUNDRUM. WHICH IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A A NEW SCENARIO OF LIFE OR WILDFIRE IS THE THREAT. WE'RE DRIVING UP THE COST THERE AS WELL SO. IT'S A HARD HARD ISSUE TO DEAL WITH BUT RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THOSE AMENDMENTS DOCTOR WHAT I I FIND MYSELF. A LITTLE CHALLENGE SO HOPEFULLY THROUGH THE SERIES OF QUESTIONS OF OTHER MEMBERS ARE GOING TO ASK I MIGHT FIND IT A DIFFERENT MINDSET BUT ALL ALL. A CLOSE UP WITH MY QUESTIONING AND SINCE THE CHAIR I SEE NOW THE CHAIR HAS. DISAPPEARED AND I AM NOW THE ACTING -- LET ME. WHO WAS FIRST BECAUSE I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION THAT? OKAY MISTER GALLAGHER YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND THEN MR DAILY. AND THEN. DODD -- SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TACKLE HERE AS IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND AND PROBABLY NO. ONE THE TWO OF US BUT THE TWO OF US PROBABLY KNOW THAT MORE THEM US RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH. WHO LAST COUPLE YEARS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD? SIX CERTAINLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CAMPFIRE WAS. DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE. AND AND AND BEING ABLE TO ENFORCE THAT BECAUSE MAYBE SOME PEOPLE DECIDED I'M JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT. AND PROPERTY OWNERS NOT REALLY HAVING THE ABILITY OR NEIGHBORING PROPERTY OWNERS NOT REALLY HAVING THE ABILITY OR HARD NOT HAVING THE TEETH TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE. DEFINITELY WANT THEY ARE HEARD. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I HEARD WAS AS WAS TALK ABOUT THE THE MANY OF THE HOMES BURNED. UP THERE FROM THE INSIDE OUT BECAUSE EMBERS HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN IN UNDER THE EAVES. INTO THE INTO THE HOMES AND IN THAT AND THE FIRE ACTUALLY BURN FROM THE INSIDE OUT SO. I THINK BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT -- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT HERE -- THE THE ONE THING THAT I THINK I'M I I MAY BE TROUBLED WITH HIS. IS OKAY WE KNOW WE NEED TO TRY AND HELP RETROFIT THOSE. THOSE BUILDINGS BUT IT MIGHT TAKE TIME LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW I THINK THE FIRE MARSHAL SAID THIS COULD TAKE A DECADE OR MORE. GET IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE BILL WE HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS AS THE DEADLINE. YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THAT COULD BE I MEAN IF YOU CONSIDER MAYBE MOVING THAT. TO MAKE THIS MORE OF A PHASED IN APPROACH BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND THERE IS GOING TO BE OF EVEN WITH SOME MONEY AVAILABLE THERE THERE'S GOING TO BE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES MAYBE THAT'S THE FIRST. QUESTION I THINK I THINK WERE I'M HAPPY TO CONSIDER HAPPY CONSIDER THAT I GUESS I MEAN. HOW MANY MORE YEARS OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES WE HAVE HOW MANY MORE LIVES HAVE TO BE LOST HOW FAR DO WE PUSH THIS OUT? YOU KNOW I MEAN I WOULD HOPE THAT HOMEOWNERS WOULD. BEGIN TO REALIZE I NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT MY HOME. THESE ARE LOW COST SOME OF THESE ARE PRACTICALLY NO COST JUST ROLL ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES OR HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU A LITTLE BIT -- AT WHAT POINT DO WE TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND HELP PREVENT AS MUCH AS WE CAN -- WE SETTING UP A REVOLVING LOAN FUND -- ENDS WITH LOW AND NO INTEREST LOANS -- CAN REALLY HELP SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE WITH THE POOREST FOLKS IN OUR STATE -- AND THESE OTHER OTHER RETROFITS ARE OR TRIGGERED AT THE SALE OF THE SALE OF A HOME -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL HARPER ON THIS BUT I WILL TELL YOU HAVING YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN IS PROBABLY THE WORST HEARTBURN OF ALL AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO PREVENT HERE. RIGHT SO. BUT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS OKAY WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S ALWAYS A REALLY BIG ASK YOU KNOW AND I'M SURE THAT AT SOME POINT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WELL. DO YOU HAVE A FUN DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PULL FROM. I GUESS I'LL BE ONE PART AND THEN YOU SAID HEY WHEN YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE YOU HAVE MORE MONEY. THAN YOU EVER GOING TO HAVE WILL ONLY WHEN THE HOUSE IS SOLD IN MONEY GETS TRANSFERRED TO YOU OUT OF ESCROW BETTER THIS BILL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT MONEY. UNTIL YOU'VE SHOWN A CERTIFICATION THAT YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING SO YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY. TO USE THAT SALE. THAT MONEY IS NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY. DO YOU PUT IN THE IMPROVEMENT RIGHT -- SO CAN YOU MAYBE GO TO THAT POINT AND I JUST HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION SOME OF IT IF YOU'RE LOW IN A IF IF IT'S IF YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME YOU'RE GOING TO QUALIFY FOR THIS AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT. GET THAT RESOURCE THERE -- FROM THIS FUND YEAH RIGHT BUT THEN WHERE DO WE GET THE MONEY TO FUND THE FUND. RATE. DO WE HAVE THAT AS A PROPOSAL YET I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG RAINY DAY FUND RIGHT NOW -- IT. MAYBE MAYBE UP SOMETHING FROM THERE MAYBE THERE'S SOME OTHER RESOURCES I'M [inaudible] YOU KNOW. BUT YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA THE SALES PROCEEDS BECAUSE THAT WAY I UNDERSTAND AFTER RIGHT YEAH I I UNDERSTAND BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUGE HUGE AMOUNT. OF RESOURCES TO TO DO THAT WILL NOT DOES MY LAST PART BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING LOW THESE ARE LOW COST IMPROVEMENTS. BUT IT SOUND TO ME LIKE FROM THE FIRE MARSHALL NUMBER ONE WHAT WE NEED IS A NEW ROOF. AND THAT WHICH IS NOT ONE OF THEM NEEDED OUR ASKING. FOR RIGHT. BUT THAT'S WHAT I GET TO IS LIKE A IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE WOOD SHAKE ROOFS MAYBE FOR EXAMPLE THEY SHOULD HAVE. BETTER ROOFS AND THAT WE NEED IN THE YOU NEED THAT PROTECTION FOR THE EVE SO THE EMBERS DON'T GET IN. IT'S NOT THOSE MIGHT BE MORE COSTLY IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT. IN THIS IS SAYING THAT AND IN THOSE WOULDN'T BE REQUIRED YOUR BILL RIGHT. TEST TEST THE REQUIREMENT -- FOR ROOFING STRUCTURES HAS BEEN IN THE BUILDING CODE FOR I THINK THIRTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS -- RELATIVE TO FIRE HAZARD TO VERY SOON AND ROOFING SO IT'S NOT AT ALL A NEW PROVISION. SO IF PEOPLE COME IN FOR A PERMIT NOW TO REPLACE THE ROSE. FOR THE LAST I BELIEVE FIFTEEN YEARS IT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY OFF WE HAVE REQURED THE PROPER ROOFING ACCORDING TO FIRE HAZARD TO BE PRESENT THAT'S NOT UNTIL YOU COME IN TO DO A NEW ROOF RIGHT I'M SOME CENTER THIS BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE RETROFITS. RIGHT. A I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT REQUIRING SPECIFICALLY A ROUGH I'M JUST SAYING THAT PEOPLE FREQUENTLY DO REPLACE THE REST BECAUSE IT IS A REPLACEABLE PORTION OF THE BUILDING ELEMENT -- AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE EVENT -- THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY REPLACE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IN THE WORLD IF WE ARE GOING TO RETROFIT THESE STRUCTURES TO BE MORE SAFE AND FIRE RESILIENT. RIGHT AND IF THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF THIS IS OF COURSE SORT OF FORCE PEOPLE TO DO IT. RIGHT. RATHER THAN A RICH THAT WITHIN SOME PERIOD OF TIME. WAS NOT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR SAYING HEY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT. THE THE GOAL -- AND IF ROOF ISN'T PART OF THAT. HAVE WE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED THE OBJECT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU NEED TO DO TO BE MORE FIRE. RIGHT. THE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDS. FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THAT. BUT THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE THEY THEN REQUEST LET'S SAY. LET'S SAY YOUR PERSON WHO DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR THE FUND. RIGHT. ARE YOU STILL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE. THE NEW ROOF IN THESE OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT. THE NEW FOR YEAH THE NEW ROOF IS NOT A REQUIREMENT BUT IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOAN OKAY BUT THE LOW COST. RETROFITS WOULD BE REQUIRED IS THAT RIGHT YES AND I THINK I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT THE BUT THE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT NOT THAT CHAIR BUT THE OTHER CHAIR. OF I'M SORRY. YOU WERE OVER THERE A MINUTE AGO. CLEARLY NOT MISTER GRAY SO -- SO I BELIEVE THE POLICY THE POLICY COME AT THE CHAIR WAS REFERRING TO WAS THAT THE YOU WITH REGARD TO RETROFITS WAS. ASKING FOR CLARITY AROUND THOSE RETROFIT RENT WOULD BE AND I AGREE THAT WE WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TO ASKING FOR CLARITY AROUND THAT WORKING WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND SO ON SO WE DON'T. HAVE THE CLARITY THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THEIR BUT A ROOF IS NOT. REQUIRED IS NOT WHAT'S GONNA BE REQUIRED BY TWENTY TO HARASS BUT IT WILL BE REQUIRED OBVIOUSLY IF YOU GO IN FOR A PERMIT FOR A NEW ROOF. EXCUSE ME THAT THAT WAS THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE WHICH IS IT'S NOT REQUIRED SPECIFICALLY IN THIS BILL BUT FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS IT HAS BEEN REQUIRED AS PART OF FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOUND MEASURES. IN THE BUILDING CODE. IN THESE DISTRICTS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE TO WRITE THAT WAS MY GOAL. BUT IT'S MORE GOING TO BE MORE ADVISORY NOW OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER WILSHIRE THANK YOU -- MR DAILY. THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS A VERY NOBLE EFFORT AND WORTHWHILE AND TIMELY AND MY I WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED [inaudible] CURIOUS. THE NEW BOARD THAT SET UP. WILL THEY OVERSEE THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND OR WHO WOULD ADMINISTER WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DO THE ADMINISTERING OF THE OF THE LOANS THE STATE TREASURER STATE TREASURER. GOOD THANK YOU. I BELIEVE MR WAS NEXT -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I WANT TO ACTUALLY -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE I KNOW YOU MAY BE MORE THAN ANY OF US HAVE SEEN -- WHAT DEVASTATION LOOKS LIKE FIRST HAND -- I ACTUALLY HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS LAST YEAR AS YOU MENTIONED -- WE SAW THAT HIGH RISK OR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS OF KIND OF EXPANDED -- THROUGHOUT THE SPEC OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- GOING MORE PLACES AND WE KIND OF ARE NORMALLY AND THINKING THAT FIRES WOULD GO. SO AS A RESULT OF THAT I'M WONDERING HOW WAS THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER DETERMINED. AND HOW WILL YOU MANAGER MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOAN -- WELL. IT'S IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL NEED WILL BE AND MY HOPE IS THAT -- THAT WOULD A BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ADEQUATE IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND SO IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH WILL KNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY IF IT'S TOO MUCH WILL KNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY AS WELL -- BUT IT SEEMS IT SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER CONSIDERING. THE KINDS A RETROFITS WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW. HAS THE RUNNING IT THOUGHT GIVEN TO HOW TO MANAGEMENT MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOAN I MEAN IS YOUR GOAL THAT A 100% OF THE MONEY WILL BE USED. OR THAT ARE YOU MEASURING IT BASED ON WHERE HOMEOWNERS ARE LOCATED I MEAN IS THERE ANY THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT -- I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT THE AND THE IF HOPE HOPEFULLY THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH THE REGIONAL THE REGIONAL -- GROUPS THAT WE'RE CREATING HERE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THE LOAN WILL BE WILL BE FULLY SUBSCRIBED -- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL AND SINCE IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND OF PEOPLE WE PAYING BACK. THEN THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HELP FOR THE FUTURE LAND OWNERS AS WE GO ALONG WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE THE MOST SEVERE AREAS IN THE STATE -- YOU KNOW IDEALLY WOULDN'T WE WANT TO HAVE ALL HOMES YOU KNOW HAVE THESE KINDS OF HAVE THESE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS AS WELL -- BUT I THINK WILL YOU KNOW A LOT IS GOING TO BE EDUCATION CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR WHICH WE TYPICALLY FIND TO BE HARD THINGS TO ACCOMPLISH -- BUT THEY'RE NECESSARY -- KNOW THESE KINDS OF THINGS YOU KNOW A DOLLAR YOU SPEND ON PREVENTION SAVES YOU FOUR DOLLARS ON THE OTHER END. THROUGHHAVING TO FIGHT A FIRE OR DO THE CLEANUP AFTERWARDS SO IT'S IT'S REALLY IS MONEY WELL SPENT. THANK YOU AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION -- DID YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT -- FIRST OFF I WANTED TO TAKE A ON A MOMENT. TO TO DO A FRIENDLY CORRECTION TO THE ASSEMBLYMAN IT IS ONE DOLLAR FOR SIX OO THAT IS THE STANDARD. IN TERMS OF PROVEN COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS FOR BUILDING MEDICATIONS IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE SO THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN PROVEN OUT THROUGH LARGE FIRES IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND STUDIED FORENSICALLY POST EFFECT. RELATIVE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE METRIC THAT -- SO IN THE LARGER COMMUNITY -- IN THE FIRE OF BOTH RESPONSE PREVENTION MITIGATION COMMUNITY THERE IS PRESS PROCESS AND PROGRAMS UNDER WAY WHERE WE ARE CAPTURING THE ELEMENTS ABOUT BUILDINGS. AND WHAT KIND OF BUILDING MATERIALS THEY HAVE WHAT KIND OF FIRES ARE OCCURRING THE POST DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT CAL FIRE USES TO EXAMINE BUILDING STRUCTURES. AND THE RESEARCH WORLD OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING WAYS TO ANALYZE EFFECTIVENESS RELATIVE TO THESE INVESTMENTS SO THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF OF WORK. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION JUST FOR THE ADVISORY BOARDS AYE I HEARD THAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN -- TO MOVE THEM FROM BEING THESE AGENCIES OR DISTRICTS TO BEING ADVISORY BOARDS THE EIGHTEEN IS IT AUTHORIZING THEM OR ALLOWING ORDERS ARE REQUIRING THE BOARDS OR I JUST. WONDER WHAT THE VERB AS WERE FOR ME [inaudible] YEAH. TO SAY THAT THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT -- WE LISTEN LIVE IN EIGHT GEOGRAPHICALLY LARGE AND DIVERSE STATE -- ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH DOES NOT WORK WELL -- WHAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT MISTER BIGELOW'S COMMUNITY MIGHT NOT MIGHT NOT HAVE MUCH MAYOR IN YOUR COMMUNITY OR MISS RUBIO'S COMMUNITY SO? SO IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE -- FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO HELP PEOPLE FOR THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THEIR OF THEIR DISTRICTS AND SO THAT'S WHY THE NUMBER. IT'S A LARGE NUMBER BUT IT IS I BELIEVE IT IS -- IT'S NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE THE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. DOCTOR WAS A THE UNITED HELLO WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE -- AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE DEVASTATION THAT'S HAPPENED A COMMUNITY OF I HAD. FIRE READ THROUGH MY COMMUNITY A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND YEAH I TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEVASTATION TRYING TO DO THE HARDENING OF THE HOMES AND STUFF. MY MY REAL CONCERN ON YOUR BILL IS ON PAGE SIX WINE THE TEEN -- THE STATE WILD FIRE PREPAREDNESS BOARD IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED IN STATE GOVERNMENT CONSISTING OF THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS. ONLINE YOU STRIKE OUT EPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THAN GOING TO THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION -- STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- STATE FIRE MARSHAL OF DIRECTOR OF OFFICE AND PLANNING RESEARCH. SECTOR DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS -- AND A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WITH EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCIENCE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. ON AND THEN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONVENE THEY'RE GONNA SET UP OTHER -- LOOKS LINE A EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS WITHIN THE STATE. TO WORK ON A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO TALK ABOUT FIRE SAFETY EXETER CENTER MY MY MY BIG QUESTION IS WHAT'S STOPPING THEM FROM DOING THIS NOW -- AND WHY AREN'T WE USING CAL FIRE TO DO GRANTS FOR HARDENING. HOMES I MEAN WHY WHY. WHY WOULD WE INITIATE ONE MORE GOVERNMENT FOR ONE MORE LAYER OF RED TAPE? AND WHEN WE WE'VE ALREADY GOT ENOUGH OF TO JUMP THROUGH ENOUGH OBSTACLES WHEN IT GOES TO GETTING THINGS DONE AND GETTING THINGS MOVING -- TO GET OUR COMMUNITIES PROTECTED FOR FIRE IN IN TO ME IT'S JUST ADDING THAT ONE EXTRA LAYER. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND WE NEED THE SECRETARY SHOULD ARE TO BE TALKING TO EACH OTHER. I AM IN I I DON'T ASSEMBLY WE NEED LEGISLATION FOR A SECRETARY TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SAY HEY LET'S GET THIS DONE WE HAVE AN ISSUE. AND WE'RE ALREADY. IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY -- THE GOVERNOR'S DECLARED TO GET IN THERE AND GET THINGS DONE NOW. SO WHY NOT GIVE CAL FIRE THE ABILITY DO GRANTS AND PULL THE FUNDING AT A G. G. R. ATHE -- TO DO HOME HARD. WELCOME BACK TO YOU. YOUR ORIGINAL COMMENTS WITH THE DIRECTOR EMERGENCY SERVICES BACK IN THE BILL SO THAT WE'RE PUTTING THAT BACK. ALSO PUTTING TO LEGISLATIVE -- APPOINTEES -- IT INTO BACK IN INTO THE MIX. I THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT. WHEN IT COMES YOU KNOW -- OUR OUR FOLKS A CAL FIRE ARE AMAZING AT THE WORK THEY DO AND I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THEM AND PUTTING OUT FIRES AND SO FORTH -- I THINK THE REALITY IS WE HAVE ENOUGH MANPOWER -- TO DO IT GOT TO DO THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. TO ACTUALLY DO THE FIRE PREVENTION. I WILL TELL YOU -- IN MY IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW -- WE STARTED THE PROJECT WE PUT STARTED IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR -- MEETING WITH CAL FIRE THE CITY IN THE COUNTY TO DO A MAJOR PROJECT TO PROTECT THE CITY OF YOU CRIER -- IT'S TAKEN A WHILE TO GET THAT OFF THE GROUND -- BUT IT'S A KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE THIS THE STATE THE CITY AND COUNTY ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO PROTECT TO DO A PROTECTION PROJECT. BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO DO AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST FEARS QUITE FRANKLY HAS BEEN. IS A WE HAD EARLY FIRE SEASON WHERE THE FOLKS THAT ARE FROM CAL FIRE GOING TO BE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING US THROUGH THESE PROJECTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE [inaudible] GONE -- THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT FIGHTING FIRES AND THAT'S JUST PART OF IT PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE THERE -- WE WE RUN INTO THESE KINDS OF THINGS YOUR EIGHT YEAR ANYHOW I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHY AROUND A BILL TO TAKE YEAH G. G. R. F. FUNDS AWAY FROM MY FIGURE ON GOING TO CAL FIRE FOR FOR THESE VERY REASONS -- BOY IT'S IT'S MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO CREATE ONE MORE AGENCY. THE THAT'S GOING TO GET IN THE WAY OF THIS I DISAGREE I THINK THAT'S AGENCIES GONNA HELP TO COORDINATE DOT -- EACH COMMUNITIES IT EAT THESE THESE EIGHT D. EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT COUNCILS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AGENCY THAT HAS THE RESORT HAS RESOURCES EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT. TO HELP THIS HAPPEN I DON'T I DON'T SEE THIS IS AN IMPEDIMENT I SEE THIS IS AS A WAY TO GET THE JOB DONE BECAUSE CLEARLY WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. ISN'T WORKING SO INSTEAD OF SAY CAL FIRE CREE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE A A PUBLIC SERVICE. OFFICER THAT'S GONNA HELP COORDINATOR HIRE A COUPLE MORE CREATING OTHER AGENCY WITH OVERHEAD AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING TO ABSORB MORE FUNDING. IS GOING TO HELP I JUST I I I DON'T ANY JUST UP FIRE I I THINK I THINK WE WANT TO GET TO THE SAME GOAL WILL RUN DIFFERENT PAY I'LL THINK CAL FIRE AND TWO MORE PEOPLE IS GOING TO HELP US IN THIS SITUATION -- THANK YOU -- MISTER GETTING IT I RESPECT YOUR PAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AS CHAIR LET ME. JUST COMMEND YOU FOR ONE STANDING UP YOUR COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TOILED -- BACK AND FORTH -- I REMEMBER WE WERE OUT IN THE COUNTRY AT A FLY RIGHT BACK. AND PUT YOUR PROFESSIONAL HAT TO IDENTIFY YOU DO FORENSIC ON THOSE WHO OF PASSION THE FIRE AND CERTAIN THIS IS A WAY FOR YOU TO STAND UP FOR YOUR FOR YOUR COMMUNITY -- CERTAINLY MY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT YOUR COMMUNITY -- YOUR COMMUNITIES MORE PRONE TO FIRES IN THIS MATTER THAN MY COMMUNITY -- AND PEOPLE OF YOUR COMMITTEE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD THAT YOU'RE STANDING OF DOING WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO AS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY. AND THAT IS PUTTING FORTH LEGISLATION WELL THOUGHT OUT LEGISLATION SO WE CONSIDERED I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION BUT YOU KNOW. TO HAVE ONE CREATE THIS IS A LONG. IF WE PUT THE MONEY UP. AS THE STATE. THAT IS PAID BACK. BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AM I CORRECT CORRECT SO. IN TERMS OF WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE WE ARE IN UNUSUAL. CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING THIS KIND OF DEVASTATION IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE -- SO WE HAVE NOTHING TO RECALL BECAUSE THIS WE'RE IN -- WE'RE STARTING BEGINNING AND WE ARE LEARNING AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND CERTAINLY I THINK WE CAN LEARN A LOT BY -- ONE UTILIZING THIS REVOLVING -- FIND -- FOR PEOPLE TO DRAW DOWN BUT AGAIN IT'S A LOAN. THEY'RE GOING TO PAY BACK THIS LONG AND IF YOU EVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE YOUR INVESTMENTS SUCH AS YOUR HOME. IS BEING DESTROYED BY A WILDFIRE THEN YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REBUILD YOUR ENTIRE LIFE NOT A WAFFLE BUT TRYING TO REBUILD -- YOUR LIFE AND CERTAINLY TO KNOW THAT THE STATE IS STANDING BEHIND BY ALLOWING ALONE -- TO TAKE PLACE I THINK IT GIVES THOSE INDIVIDUALS SOME KIND OF COMFORT AND I THINK THAT YOU AGAIN WITH THE RETROFITTING THINGS OF THAT NATURE WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED I DON'T WANT. TO BELABOR THE TIME BUT I THINK THIS IS -- IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND ALSO WITH THE COMMITTEE -- THAT YOU WANT TO START I WOULD ASSUME THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE LOCAL INDIVIDUALS -- WHO HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE THE CONVERSATION TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO AS RELATES TO THIS ANY OTHER ISSUES COMING UP CORRECT YOU'RE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT? SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S Y. ME THE MOST [inaudible] MR COOLEY. MISTER WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME. COMMENTS I MEAN I CAN SEE. HOW IF WE HAD A CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION? YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT THESE PEOPLE TOGETHER YOU JUST SORT OF DO IT. BUT MY GENERAL SENSE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WILDFIRE ISSUE. IN A IN A IN A DIFFERENT WAY IS NOT REALLY A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY PROBLEM. I THINK YOU DEAL WITH A WILDLAND INTERFACE IT'S MORE OF AN AREA OF MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN HEAVY TIMBER. THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS MAYBE CHAPARRAL. INTENTION APPAREIL AREAS THIS IS NOT THE PREPONDERANCE OF WHERE CALIFORNIANS LIVE [inaudible] AND WHATEVER IS HAPPENING CLIMATE WISE I ACTUALLY FAVOR SOMETHING BOLD ON THE PART OF CALIFORNIA. SOMETHING LIKE A MARSHALL PLAN. SO DO WHERE IS WE IS AN ENTIRE STATE. IT KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE CALIFORNIA'S AT RISK. FOR REASONS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE DYNAMICS. AND WE START TRYING TO TACKLE THE PIECES OF WHICH WE CAN. I WANT TO SAY THIS IDEA OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC HARDING SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE CONVERSATION. IF YOU'RE IN FLORIDA IF YOU'RE ON THE IF YOU'RE ON THE GULF COAST. THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT ARE THE PROJECT IMPROVES A CREMATED HUMAN HOMES HUMAN HABITATION. TO MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF KNOWN THREAT. THIS IS SORT OF A STANDARD TOOL IN A TOOL KIT. THE THINK ABOUT HOW YOU DEAL WITH THESE SORTS OF THINGS. ARM. HONESTLY I WHEN I LOOK AT THIS. OUR I VIEW THIS IS REALLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW DO FOR ALMOST FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. TACKLE A PROBLEM THAT IS. INCREASINGLY PARAMOUNT FOR A LOT OF OUR RURAL NEIGHBORS. HOW DO WE AS A STATE PULL TOGETHER? AND IF IT DOES BECOME A RESOURCE QUESTION. BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENT TO WHEN KEN MADDY. DID A HANDSHAKE DEAL AFTER LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE. SO LET'S LET'S RAISE SALES TAXES SO WE CAN REBUILD THINGS THAT NEED TO BE RE REBUILT IN THE BAY AREA. YOU KNOW THAT'S MORE THE MODEL OF HOW GOVERNMENT'S WORKS. WERE THEN WITHIN THE AREA OF CALIFORNIA WE TRY TO TACKLE ARE PRESSING ISSUES -- SO WHY. I LOOK AT THIS I THINK WELL THERE'S A LOT OF OPEN ISSUES HERE FOR B. AS A LAWYER WHEN I READ THIS. HOWARD ENTER TWINED TO THE CIVIL CORD THE TRANSFER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT IT'S INTEGRATED AND EVERY WILL PROPERTY TRANSACTION. HOW DOES THIS DO WILD FIRE HAZARD JOAN INTEGRATE WITH LIKE THE ALL CHRIS PRIAL SEISMIC DISTRICTS SEISMIC MAPPING ISSUES WHAT'S THE NATURE THE CERTIFICATION THAT WE'RE DOING HERE? BUT I VIEW THIS IS THESE ARE SORT OF NEEDS THE PEOPLE CAN SORT OF FIGURE OUT HOW WOULD FIFTY SCENES TOGETHER. SURELY THERE'S A NEED FOR A FUNDING STREAM BUT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW. THOSE OF US WHO ARE ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE OR NOW THE LONGEST SERVING LAWMAKERS IN THE HISTORY CONFERENCE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AND THOSE WITH THE WAR LIKE IN TWENTY TWELVE RUN THAT SAME PATH YOURSELF. WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON HOW WE REINVENT THIS INSTITUTION TO PULL TOGETHER FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND AND TAKE A MORE LONG TERM VIEW OF ISSUES. AND THAT'S SORT OF SO I SORT OF THINK A BILL LIKE THIS IS CHALLENGING AS IT IS. IT'S SORT OF AN INVITATION TO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GROW THE INSTITUTION. TO TAKE THIS MORE WIDE RANGING VIEW OF THE WHOLE STATE BEING AND THINGS TOGETHER. AND I ACTUALLY SAVE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SOME DISCOMFORT WAS SORT OF THE CHARACTER POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN OUR COUNTRY. TO BE ABLE TO WRAP AROUNDS RUN AN ISSUE THE AFFECTION TIRE STATE AND LOOK AT HOW THE WHOLE STATE WOULD PULL TOGETHER. IS ACTUALLY TAKEN OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTION A VERY HEALTHY DIRECTION. AND I DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES FROM. AN AIR THIS HAD RURAL DEVASTATION. I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I ACTUALLY INTEND TO SUPPORT TODAY AND I WOULD. URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO THINK ABOUT. BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS TO BE ON BOARD AT THIS TIME I MEAN I THINK. IT'S A TIME TO BE THINKING OUT LOUD. MOVING FORWARD. SO -- THE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW YOU WOULD FINANCE A SORT OF THING BUT I SORT OF THINK. LIKE TO LOWER PUT EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE TARGETING A COMPARATIVE SMALL NUMBER OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH A FIX. WILL SAY PUBLIC DOLLARS A LONG RUN. AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO START COMMITTED REVENUE STREAM TO THAT SORT OF MARSHALL PLAN IDEA -- ITS ADVANTAGES THE STATE AS A WHOLE [inaudible] ARM SO. I I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THIS BILL -- AND I SEE THIS OFF WHEN I DRAFT LEGISLATION MYSELF. I PUT SOME IDEAS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE TAKE POT SHOTS AT AND I ALWAYS SAY. I LIKE TO I AM DOING WRONG BY THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT NOT AT ALL. AND I LOOK AT THIS BILL MISTER WOULD AND I THINK I LIKED WE'RE DOING WRONG BY THE WAY I'M TO LEARN NOT AT ALL A KIND OF MOVES US ON A MORE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING BASIS IN THE WHOLE STATE. IT STARTS TO TARGET AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE ISSUES AND FRANKLY FOR ME AS A DEMOCRAT IT SETS ME UP. TO REALLY RECKON WITH ISSUES OF BY. MORE RURAL CALIFORNIANS AND REMIND THEM THAT. THEY MAY FEEL THEY'RE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF JEFFERSON. BUT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR BACK. SO I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT SORT OF CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN OUR DAY THANK YOU. I JUST SAY A MILLION. FOR A LITTLE LEVITY. BUT NOT TO LIGHTEN THE POINT. OKAY IS THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE A QUESTION -- DID ANYBODY DOWN HERE TODAY MISS ANYONE WANT TO BE. I OKAY SO LET ME JUST KIND OF STRUCTURE THIS FOR EVERYONE TO GET US ALL BACK ON THE PAGE WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER GIBSON SECOND BY MISTER SALAS. A TO FOR IT TO PASS AND IT'S A THE MOTION IS TO APPROVE THE ITEM AS AMENDED LET ME WITH REFLECTANCE MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR WITH THE AUTHOR. AS WE UNDERSTAND IT YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE -- AMENDMENTS OF REMOVING THE PROVISIONS DESIGNATING THE EIGHTEEN NEW REGIONAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION DISTRICTS AS STATE AGENCIES. INSTEAD THEY WILL BE ADVISORY BODIES TO THE NEW STATE -- BOARD WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY CORRECT AND THE OTHER ONE IS AT THE DIRECTOR OF CAL -- YES ONE OF POINT HE WITH CAL FIRE PREVENTION EXPERIENCE. FROM BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TO THE NEW STATE BOARD CORRECT OKAY AND THEN YOU ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED -- RETROFIT REQUIREMENT. ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT I BELIEVE THAT THAT. THE THE WAY THE WAY WE UNDERSTOOD THIS AND SO IF I IF I AM WRONG HERE THAT MIGHT WINNER STAND THAT WITH REGARD TO READ FOR FITS -- WE'RE THROUGH THAT WE WERE ASKING FOR YOU'RE ASKING FOR CLARITY AROUND THOSE RETROFITS IT WOULD -- WOULD BE AT WHICH I AGREE WITH BUT NOT TO REMOVE THE REST FOR FIT REQUIREMENT IF YOU DO YOU DO THAT YOU REMOVED THE HEART OF THE BILL I SO I DON'T. I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL JUST PACK UP MY TEN GO HOME IF THAT'S THE IF THAT WAS THE THE THE WILL OF THE CHAIR SO. OKAY SO GIVEN THAT SAID -- THIS IT THERE IS A MOTION TO DO PASSED -- AND THE CLARITY THIS OR ANY CONFUSION ON ANYONE'S PARKS THIS IS BEEN A LONG. HEARING ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM DOCTOR WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND STRAIGHT FOR NURSE AND I THINK SPEAKING FOR ALL OF US WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I AND I YOU KNOW LOOK I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS ENCUMBER PEOPLE WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS I KNOW THAT LIFE IS EXPENSIVE -- I THINK LOSING YOUR HOUSE COULD BE THE ONE THE MOST DEVASTATING THING SHE COULD POSSIBLY EXPERIENCE. LOSING A LOVED ONE IN A FIRE -- PASSED IT FOR AND DOES FAR SURPASSED THAT -- WE ARE ALSO I BELIEVE -- WE'RE SEEING THIS NOW. ENTERING INTO AN INSURANCE CRISIS IN IN MANY AREAS IN THE STATE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THEIR FIRE INSURANCE. RATES. TRACK A DRUG GO UP DRAMATICALLY MANY PEOPLE HAVE FIRE INSURANCE FOR DECADES ARE FINDING THEIR FIRE INSURANCE -- CANCEL -- AND I BELIEVE THAT THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO RETROFIT THEIR HOMES TO TRY TO CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN THE LONG RUN COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE A LOT OF US A LOT OF MONEY. AND KEEP US POTENTIALLY INSURED OUT THERE AND SO I YOU KNOW IT SUBSIDES I HOPE THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE. IN THE LONG RUN. INEXPENSIVE RETROFITS DEFENSIBLE SPACE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS MIGHT ENSURE THAT YOU ARE FIRE INSURANCE. MIGHT ENSURE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO BUY A HOME -- AND AND ENSURE THAT TRUTH WITH A MORTGAGE AND SO -- HOPE IN THAT SPIRIT THAT PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO AGAIN WANTING EVERYONE TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES -- COMMITTEE AND I I COMMEND YOU AND APPRECIATE IT. AS I SPOKE EARLIER I COUNTY INDICATED I WOULD BE A NO I THINK AFTER HEARING ALL OF THIS AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO BE AT LEAST FOR THE REPUBLICANS IF THEY WANT. VOTE ANYWAY YOU WANT BUT I'M GONNA NOT VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY -- SO YOU AND I CAN WORK ON THAT ONE LAST LIEU. AREA OF CONFUSION AND MAYBE EVEN THE CHAIRMAN HIMSELF WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONFUSION ON THE RETROFIT COMPONENT. IF YEAH AND I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES WITH THAT SAID -- WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I COULD WRITE BEFORE COULD SURE FOR WITH YES ALL THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE INDEED TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] YES.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO A MINOR PRESENTATION WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL A I ACTUALLY WANTED TO JUST -- COMPLIMENT MISTER COOLEY ON THE COMMENTS HE MADE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S THE HIGHLY URBAN DENSE AREA OR THE RURAL AREAS WE HAVE CHALLENGES FACING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA SO. SOME KIND OF A MITIGATING FUND THAT ADDRESSES UP SEISMIC ACTIVITY FIRES -- OR OR RUNOFF IS ALL GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND IT'S GONNA BE A CONVERSATION THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY TIMELY. PRESENTATION WOULD THANK YOU HAVE YOUR WITNESSES TESTIFIED WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DANIEL -- MUELLER ON BEHALF OF THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND SHANE DILLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE -- TO SURE DO YOUR PRESENTATION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND DANIELLE MILLER WITH THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE WE ARE A TECHNICAL SOCIETY OF EXPERTS DEDICATED TO REDUCING EARTHQUAKE RISK BASED IN OAKLAND. WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TOOK FOUR TWO NINE WHICH CALLS FOR A STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF BUILDINGS KNOWN TO BE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR COLLAPSE AND EARTHQUAKES. AND HELPS TO ESTABLISH A MITIGATION PROGRAM FOR THESE BUILDINGS THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARD QUANTIFYING THE EXTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE FIRST STEP THAT THIS IS A FIRST STEP TOWARD FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT SUPPORTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN IDENTIFYING. AND RETROFITTING THESE BUILDING SOME OF WHICH ARE DOING THIS ALREADY. WE ARE PLEASE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION SITS WITH THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION AND WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR EXPERTISE TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM -- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SUCH AN INVENTORY TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE CITY LEVEL WHERE IMPLEMENTATION WILL TAKE PLACE AND TO IDENTIFY THE USE AND STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES OF THESE BUILDINGS. CALIFORNIA'S THE MOST SEISMICALLY ACTIVE REGION IN THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF ALASKA WITH A POINT SEVEN OR GREATER EARTHQUAKE BEFORE. TWENTY FORTY TWO WE HAVE 66% OF THE NATIONAL -- ANNUALIZED EARTHQUAKE LOSSES AMOUNTING TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT POURTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA AND FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] SOCIAL SCORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE AND CHANGE OVER THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS ARE CALVO. WE WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLYMAN AS WELL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON SEISMIC RESILIENCY AND WE SUPPORT OUT. FOR TWENTY NINE SPECIFICALLY IN -- THIS BILL BUT WE SUPPORT THE FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION -- THAT WAS. PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND THE FOCUS OF THE INVENTORY ON MULTI FAMILY AND PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE BUILDINGS WE THINK THAT'S REASONABLE AND ACCOMPLISH ABLE. AT THIS POINT WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE REQUIREMENT TO SECURE FUNDING FOR THIS EFFORT AND THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION'S LEADERSHIP. ON ON PERFORMING THE INVENTORIES ON BEHALF OF OUR SIX HUNDRED SITTING COUNTY MEMBER BUILDING OFFICIALS -- WE WANT TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IN THIS EFFORT. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH COMMITTEE GERMANY SMITHING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORT. SEEING THEIR ADDITIONAL -- TESTAMENT SPORT WE HAVE ANY TESTIMONY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID BONTA WITH SUMMER FAXING STRUCTURAL ENGINEER IN SAN FRANCISCO I DID SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. AND A FOLLOW UP EMAIL ASKING -- FOR KNOWLEDGE MAN MISTER DAYTON TELLS ME THE LETTER WAS NOT RECEIVED SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE COMMITTEES AND THINGS NO OTHER. TESTIMONY I MIGHT ASK FR AN ADDITIONAL MINUTE OR TWO TO MAKE MY POINTS [inaudible] THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU AGAIN MY NAME IS DAVID BONTA WITH SOME A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER PRACTICING IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRANCISCO I REALLY DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE TODAY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BE IN A POSITION OPPOSITE. AN ORGANIZATION LIKE HE ARRIVE WHICH I'M A MEMBER. I'M ALSO MEMBER THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHO IS NOT YET TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL ALSO TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN WHO'S A CHAMPION FOR SEISMIC SAFETY I RESPECT HIS INTENTIONS 1100%. ON THIS BILL AND I SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. THREE NINETY THREE ON THIS BILL HOWEVER IS MISGUIDED I THINK YOU WILL ACTUALLY DO MORE HARM. THAN GOOD WITH REGARD TO SEISMIC SAFETY IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DETAILS OF THE BILL AND THE TIMING. THERE IS MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE AT THE SEA LEVEL. AS DANIEL MENTIONED AT THE CITY LEVEL IS WERE ALL SEISMIC MITIGATION IS CONCEIVED AND PLANNED AND LEGISLATED AND FUNDED AND IMPLEMENT. THIS MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW IN THIS BILL WILL STOP IT HE WILL INTERFERE WITH WORK THAT'S BEING DONE RIGHT NOW. LAW TELLS ALL THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO WAIT THREE YEARS FOR DATA. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD WAIT THREE YEARS. WE WANT A BILL THAT COULD BE ACTUALLY MORE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN AND ARE WILLING TO BE DOING. I'VE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED MULTI BUILDING INVENTORIES AND SEISMIC MITIGATION PROGRAMS FOR STATE AGENCIES FOR CITIES AND FOR PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. AND AGAIN I'M SORRY I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT IT IS OKAY FOR YOU TO BE IN FAVOR OF SEISMIC SAFETY INSTALL VOTE NO ON THIS BILL IT IS OKAY TO BE FOR YOU TO BE IN FAVOR OF GOOD LOCAL INVENTORIES AND STILL VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. IN FACT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL SO THAT IT CAN BE RETOLD BEFORE IT MOVES INTO THE FULL ASSEMBLY THERE ARE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE TO IMPROVE THE BILL. FOR ONE AS DANIEL ALREADY MENTIONED. THE BILL NEEDS TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTING FOR THE USE OF BUILDINGS INCLUDING HOUSING THE CURRENT BILL EXEMPTS THREE QUARTERS OF ALL THE HOUSING IN THE STATE. WHY DO THAT? THE BILL OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTING FOR LOCAL. CONTEXT TO REMOTE TO SUPPORT RESILIENCE SPACE PLANNING WHICH IS DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LÃ  TO RECOGNIZE WHERE ALL THE MITIGATION WORK IS BEING DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RIGHT NOW THE BILL SAYS INSTEAD LET'S HAVE THE STATE DO SOMETHING THEY'LL COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION AND THREE YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THEY'RE DONE THE DUMP IT ON THE CITIES. AND THEN THE CITY'S DON'T WANT. THERE ARE GOING TO USE IT. SAM JUST CALL US AND JUST ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN MOMENTUM AND THEY'RE DOING IT THE SMALL JURISDICTIONS DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD ANYTHING ANYWAY. WHAT WE WHAT THEY NEED IS SOME SUPPORT FROM THE COMMISSION SOME OF THE ADVICE GUIDANCE TEMPLATES ON HOW DO A RESPONSE WHEN VICTORIA ONE RIGHT NOW THE ONLY MODELS THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW OR% THE BIG CITIES? AND THE VERY PROACTIVE ONCE YOUR GOOD BRING YOUR COMMENTS TO A CONCLUSION THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AGAIN THE GOOD NEWS IS THE BILL CAN BE SAVED. OUR INITIAL COUNTER BUILDING USE THE SO CAL PURSUE SPECIFIC CONTEXT IT NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL THE WORK IS BEING DONE OF A LOCAL LEVEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT I SEE SOME ADDITIONAL -- TESTIMONY AND SO IN OPPOSITION. JUST JUST REAL QUICK I'M RANCOR STING AYE PRACTICING STRUCTURE AND HERE I AM WITH THE STRUCTURES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S THEY MENTION IS PART OF OUR GROUP. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY AS HE SAID WE DON'T YET HAVE A POSITION ON THIS -- BOTTOM LINE FOR US AND I WAS KEEP A QUICK WE KNOW WE NEED TO QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM RIGHT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM BUT WE ALSO. NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN HER DAVID SAYING RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BOTH HERE AND WE WISH WE COULD DO BOTH IN THIS BILL. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMISSION BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS A FIRST STEP OF ANYTHING THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK COMING AFTER THIS. OKAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY SEEING NONE OF AND BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR A CUT QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M JUST WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR RESPONSE TO THE GENTLEMAN'S -- COMMENTS WHAT THAT HE BROUGHT UP IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. RATHER THAN IN YOUR CLOTHES. SURE HAPPY TO ACTUALLY I WAS GOING TO OFFER TO ANSWER A QUESTION. I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH THEM SO I'M HAPPY TO DO SO -- THIS IS THIS ISN'T OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW NOTHING NEW THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT IN FACT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS BILL -- WAS HAD GONE TO THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR AND WAS BE TOWED BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL COST -- TO THE STATE -- SAID THIS WAS A REDO AND AN ATTEMPT TO LOOK AT IT DIFFERENT AND NOT PLACE THE BURDEN ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- IN FACT THIS ALSO. LESSEN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS THAT. HAVE TO RESPOND TO THIS. BUT I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW WHAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS SAYING PART OF THE CHALLENGE. IS THAT BUT IF YOU DON'T IN SENT SOME OF THAT STILL LARGER CITIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS SIZE AS A STATE WE'RE ALREADY BUT BEHIND THE GAME. WHEN YOU HAVE PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES DOING AN INVENTORY AND FINDING OUT THAT THERE ARE FIFTEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES IN LA CITY ALONE NOT COUNTY LA CITY ALONE? THAT ARE VULNERABLE -- THAT BEGS THE QUESTION OF WELL WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING TO PUT DIFFERENT PLACE. PIECES INTO PLACE WE HAVE A REVOLVING FUND WE HAVE WE'RE WORKING ON A TAX CREDIT. BILL WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT MIDI GUITAR. MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE STILL DON'T EVEN HAVE THE PROGNOSIS OF EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE'RE DEALING WITH SO FIRST WE NEED TO FIND THE INVENTORY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER JONES SORT. THIS IS ERIN AND I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS -- I HAVEN'T WORKED ON THESE ISSUES. SINCE -- NINETY FOUR DURING THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WAS MERGING PARRIS COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY. AND YOUR WIFE AND I WORKED ON A LOT UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS IN IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING WITH THEIR CHOOSE A SMARTER. TO TO AND IT'S BEEN REALLY WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD. TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES BE SWEET TO SEE LOS ANGELES HAS A THOUSAND BUILDINGS AND WE TOOK INVENTORY. AND WE FOUND HOW MANY WERE NOT UP TO SEISMIC -- STABILITY WE WENT TO THE VOTERS GOT THE MONEY AND WERE ABLE TO FIX THAT. IF IT WASN'T FOR EARTHQUAKES WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUSH CITIZENS TO DO THAT OR EVEN TO DO THE INVENTORY. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE I'VE BEEN TAKEN OFF. BEING EMERGING BRITISH CORD IT WE HAVEN'T HAD A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BECAUSE OF ME -- BUT THAT BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS OF OF WE GET A CALL CRISIS COMFORT. WE GET REALLY REALLY -- AT EASE SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD A EARTHQUAKE WHICH IS FAR ENOUGH BACK OF OUR MINDS WE HAVE A MAJOR SIX POINT OH SINCE SINCE BEEN. AND WE GET LAZY. AND WE DON'T DO THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IN HIS BILL SO I COMMEND YOU FOR FOR DOING IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT NOW. BECAUSE WHEN WITH WHEN THE BIG ONE DOES HAPPEN. IS ALL GOING TO BE A BUNCH OF A WISH I COULDA SHOULDA DONE SOMETHING IN THE PAST SO I COMMEND YOU FOR RECORD KEEPING THIS ALIVE AND MOVING IT.

MR LOW PLEASE APPROACHING PRESENT YOUR BILLS. FAVORITE MISS RESEARCHER DID YOU -- FOR FOR ME GO IN ORDER. OF FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS AB ONE SEVENTY SEVEN ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. YES PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER USE -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN THIS BILL MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND YET WE ARE HERE WE ARE AGAIN -- THIS HELPS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AS MUCH OF ORDER PARTICIPATION AS POSSIBLE AND INCREASING VOTER RIGHTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FIVE OH HAVE WITNESSES TO SPEAK BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT. TESTAMENT SUPPORT. THE THANK YOU HELLO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JANE HOOD I'M A SOPHOMORE AT UC BERKELEY. DURING THE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS I ORGANIZED VOTER REGISTRATION AND GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS ON CAMPUS ENSURING THAT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD IN THE LAST ELECTION. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MANY STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD BENEFIT AND NEED THE PASSAGE OF AB. ONE SEVEN SEVEN THROUGHOUT THE FALL I WITNESSED THAT MANY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TO OUR VOTING PROCESSES. SAME DAY REGISTRATION DROP BOXES FOR BALLOTS AND VOTE BY MAIL HELPED SO MANY STUDENTS CAST THEIR VOTE. I ALSO NOTICED HOWEVER AND I'M CONCERNED WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF SUCH CHANGES. MANY FRANTIC STUDENTS APPROACHED ME ON ELECTION DAY. CONFUSED AND UNSURE HOW THEY WERE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO VOTE. BETWEEN CLASS AND WORKED THERE WAS LITTLE TIME FOR STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO A VOTING CENTER AND COMPLETE SAME DAY REGISTRATION. THERE WAS LITTLE TIME FOR THEM TO COMMUTE NINETY MINUTES TO THEIR DESIGNATED POLLING LOCATION AFTER CLASS AND WORK. OUR SYSTEM CAN BE DAUNTING COMPLICATED AND TIME CONSUMING ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST TIME VOTERS. CLEARLY THERE ARE STILL MANY BARRIERS THAT EXIST IN THE WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO VOTE MAKING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY WOULD REMOVE ONE OF THEM. TIME. OUR DEMOCRACY PRESENTS PEOPLE WITH DIFFICULT CHOICES HOW CAN WE GO TO SCHOOL AND WORK AND CHILD CARE AND THE GROCERY STORE AND READ THE ENTIRE VOTER GUIDE AND VOTE ALL IN ONE DAY. WE MUST ENSURE THAT NO CALIFORNIAN HAS TO STRUGGLE TO FIND THE TIME TO VOTE. I MAKING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY. AT UC BERKELEY WE ARE CURRENTLY ORGANIZING AROUND THIS EFFORT TO DESIGNATED AS A NON INSTRUCTIONAL DAY FOR STUDENTS. TO SWITCH CLASSES FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO VOTE AND LEARN ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AS A CAMPUS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE ELECTION DAY FESTIVALS ARE IN FACT SOME OF THE MOST A TIME A FISHING TO AND ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT METHODS TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT. I STRONGLY URGE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS AB ONE SEVEN SEVEN AND TO CONTINUE TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO OUR DEMOCRACY THANK YOU SO MUCH. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AB ONE SEVEN SEVEN ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA'S WILL HAVE. THE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE BY MAKING ELECTION DATE A STATE HOLIDAY AB SEVEN SEVEN AB ONE SEVEN SEVEN DEMONSTRATES CALIFORNIA STRONG AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY BY ENSURING. THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS MORE OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE. FURTHERMORE DECLARING ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY I A HOLIDAY WILL GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO AN IMPORTANT DAY AND HELP FOSTER A SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY CIVIC SPIRIT AND ENGAGEMENT. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THE CFE SUPPORTS AB ONE SEVEN SEVEN ONE SHOP SUPPORT THE REQUESTED YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY TESTIMONY OPPOSITION. EXCUSE ME MY APOLOGIES -- I'M HERE IN SUPPORT THAT STILL OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN GRAY -- AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD MY NAME IS DAN ALBERT I AM ALSO STUDENT UC BERKELEY I SERVED AS THE VOTE COALITION DIRECTOR FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS. IN WHICH I ALSO HELPED -- MY PEER JANE HOOD WITH REGISTERING STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ELECTORATE THE NECESSARY TIME TO EXERCISE THEIR CIVIC DUTY. WHILE ALSO IMPARTING GREATER SYMBOLISM ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER MANY WAYS TO APPROACH THE ISSUE OF LOW VOTER TURNOUT AND THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION THAT WILL BE THE PANACEA. BUT THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO APPROACH VOTING ACCESSIBILITY FROM A VARIETY OF ANGLES AND IMPLEMENT MANY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL WORK IN TANDEM TO MAKE IT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MORE ENGAGING AND ACCESSIBLE. TO ALL OF THE ELECTORATE THANK YOU. AND HI MY NAME IS JEREMY I'M ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT UNDER ME SIR I I'M I'M A COLLEAGUE OF JANE DÃ¢N IS ALSO UC BERKELEY -- AGAIN STANDING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE TIME CONSUMING NATURE. SCHEDULES HAVE NOT JUST SOME PEOPLE ESPECIALLY STUDENTS AND HOW WE ARE ORGANIZING AROUND THE VOTE -- IN THIS PAST MISTER ELECTION WE FACE THAT ISSUE WITH NUMEROUS STUDENTS I WAS GONNA HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE STUDIES. THE TWENTY FOURTEEN PEW RESEARCH CENTER REPORT SURVEYED REGISTERED VOTERS WHO SAID IN CLASS ABOUT THAT YEAR AND TWO THIRDS SAID THEY DIDN'T VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. MORE THAN HALF OF THAT GROUP 35% OF THE TOTAL SAID CONFLICTS WITH WORK. OR SCHOOL SCHEDULES GOT IN THE WAY. TWENTY FOURTEEN TOUGH SURVEY SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS IN THE MOST COMMONLY CITED REASON AMONG YOUNG REGISTERED FOR NOT VOTING WAS HAVING SCHEDULING CONFLICTS. WE BELIEVE MAKING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY WILL REMOVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIER STUDENTS FACE TOWARD BEING ABLE TO VOTE. AND WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY DO SO. THANKS. MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT AND I WAS ALSO ASKED TO PASS ALONG THE SUPPORT OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY -- WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS [inaudible] GALLAGHER -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- YOU KNOW AS AS AN A LOT ALUMNUS OF UC BERKELEY -- REGISTERED IN BERKELEY. CARRIED A FULL COURSE LOAD. I WORKED AT THE RSF. INVOLVED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS VOTED EVERY TIME. MY PRECINCT WAS A BLOCK FROM CAMPUS -- YOU KNOW WAS A VERY DIFFICULT. THAT TO VOTE SO I MEAN I KNOW. MAYBE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN CHALLENGING IN THE YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN. ON THE BERKELEY CAMPUS BUT YOU KNOW I I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH OF AN IMPEDIMENT -- TO GO TO VOTE BUT BUT ON THE SAME LINES IF IT WAS A STATE HOLIDAY. AS I AM UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE. WOULDN'T THOSE CAMPUSES BE CLOSE DOWN. AND HOW WOULD THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR INSTANCE ON CAMPUS IF NO ONE'S THERE AND IT'S A STATE HOLIDAY THAT'S ONE OF ONE CONCERN. THIS LOW YES SIR WAS THAT THEY DID THE ONLY CONCERN OR ISSUE THAT YOU HAD YEAH -- SURE. I MIGHT HAVE A DRESS THAT IN THE CLOSE AS I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ACTION THE SAME SEE LAST YEAR IN WHICH WE HAD ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. OKAY WILL GO TO A SELDOM LENDERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEN SINCE -- WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THEM DIRECTLY TODAY I WILL JUST SAY THAT -- I HAVE. FIVE KIDS TO THEM IN COLLEGE BOTH OF THEM MANAGE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ONE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO VOTE -- FROM BOOT CAMP. WHILE HE WAS IN THE NAVY -- SO CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. YOU CAN BE A PERMANENT ABSENTEE HAVE THOUGH BY MAIL THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO VOTE IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT CERTAIN DATA -- AND NOT ON STATE HOLIDAYS IS NECESSARY OR THAT IT WOULD HAVE THAT MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON THE VOTER TURNOUT BUT I AGREE WITH YOU AND WITH. YOU KNOW THE NOTION THAT WE WANT MORE PEOPLE GETTING OUT THERE AND VOTING I JUST I DON'T SEE THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE THAT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THIS LOW WE'VE HAD THIS BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- SEVERAL TIMES CERTAINLY SOME. I'VE HEARD SOME. QUESTIONS CONCERNS LEVELED -- YOUR WAY THAT -- THE BARRIERS PERHAPS ARE QUITE AS HIGH -- NO ONE SEEMS TO SPOKE AND TO THE MERITS OF HAVING A HOLIDAY REGARDLESS OF THE BARRIERS -- HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE. THAT AN EVENT AND DRIVING THAT THE MORE WITH THE MORE DIFFUSE WE MAKE OUR VOTING -- ACCESSIBILITY AND METHODS THAT LOWER PARTICIPATION YOU SEE AND THEN ACTUALLY. CENTRALIZE FASHION -- AN EFFORT THAT CAN INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND ALL THE WAY UP TO THE EXTREME SIDE OF THAT DEBATE -- LIKE YOU SEE IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE MANDATORY. VOTING -- ON I DON'T LIKE PAYING TAXES AND YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE MY SUPPORT -- HERE TODAY ISSUE HAVE PREVIOUSLY THIS COMMITTEE -- WITH THAT I'LL. LEAVE IT TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CO AUTHORING.

MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY OUR PRESIDENTS DAY OR CESAR CHAVEZ DAY WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED AS A HOLIDAY IN TWO THOUSAND YES WE WILL RECOGNIZE AND PROVIDE A DECREASE OPPORTUNITY. FOR VOTER PARTICIPATION BUT WE'RE ALSO DOES THIS DO IT ALLOWS US TO PAUSE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE IN CONVERSATION ABOUT WHY DO WE HAVE THIS DAY OFF. AND WHAT DO WE CARE ABOUT WHAT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS A SOCIETY TO PARTICIPATE IN HOLD OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ACCOUNTABLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND THAT WE WILL FIND EDITION A WAYS TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING -- INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO TAKE THE TIME OF THE DAYS LOOK ON THE MLK DAY WE HAVE A DAY OF SERVICE INDIVIDUALS GOING ON SAYING WHAT IS THEM OKAY. ALL ABOUT AND THEY DO INDIVIDUALS DO DAY OF SERVICE -- AND SO VOTING CENTERS WILL INDEED BE INCREASED AND THIS TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF WHICH PEOPLE HAVE TIME TO DO SO -- AND THIS IS A RECORD THAT THE STATE IS GOING AN AUTOMATED VOTER REGISTRATION PROPOSALS FOR LIKE IN THE HIGH TECH SECTOR.
