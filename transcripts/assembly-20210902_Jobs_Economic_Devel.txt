ONE OH FIVE TODAY. FIRST EXCEPT AS OF JUST ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE REFERENCE TO THE MAY TWELFTH A CONFLICT. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE OH FIVE WILL ESTABLISH SISTER STATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA IN THE PROVINCE OF SONIC AND ARMENIA. SINICA'S THE SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE IN ARMENIAN HAS PROFOUND HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR ARMENIA AND THE WORLD. IT IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PROVINCES OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF ARMENIA IS ALSO HOME TO ARMENIA STONE ARMENIAN STONEHENGE WHICH DATES BACK TO THE BRONZE AGE AND HAS. PETROGLYPH FIX THAT ARE SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS OLD SINICA'S IS RUBBER ARMENIANS AS THE BACKBONE OF OUR MEDIA AS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPORTING AND EXPORTING GOODS FROM THE SELF. WHY IS TRADE FROM THE SELF SO CRITICAL SINICA'S BORDERED BY ARSHAQ. ARTSAKH AZERBAIJAN AND IRAN. SINCE AZERBAIJAN AND TURKEY WERE ENGAGED IN AN ECONOMIC BLOCKADE BLOCKAGE OF ARMENIA WITHOUT ABOUT JOHN BORDER IN THE EAST AND WEST SENECA IS A TRADE LIFELINE TO ARMENIA FOR ITS BORDER WITH IRAN. STRIP IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SOON IT COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME AS REGIONAL POWERS LIKE AZERBAIJAN AND TURKEY POSE A THREAT TO ITS EXISTENCE. IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAILED TO SPEAK OR ACT AS OBSERVERS ON RENEWED WAR. AGAINST THE ARMENIANS OF NAGORNO KARABAKH REPUBLIC WHICH BORDERS TUNIC. IN ABSENCE OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE. THE AZERBAIJANI MILITARY CROSSED INTO THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA AND MOVED THREE POINT FIVE KILOMETERS INTO SENATE PROVINCE SEIZING THE ENTIRE. ENTIRETY OF SIEVE LAKE. I'VE BEEN A GREAT SUPPORTER OF ARMENIA AND THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY OVER THE YEARS THIS YEAR I INTRODUCED AB TEN NINETEEN WHICH RESTRICTS INVESTMENT IN TURKEY FOR THEIR CONTINUED DENIAL OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND THE SUPPORT OF CURRENT AGGRESSIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALPERS GREATLY REDUCED THEIR EXPOSURE TO TURKISH INVESTMENT. THIS RESOLUTION REAFFIRMS CALIFORNIA SOLIDARITY WITH ARMENIA. AN HOUR ONE MILLION STRONG COMMUNITY OF OUR CALIFORNIA ARMENIANS. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. MISTER IS THERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE THE SENATOR IS ON A SHORT TIME LINE SO I WOULD YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY CHAU THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU- CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR BRING THIS. FORWARD THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OBVIOUSLY. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE CITY OF GLENDALE BECAME THE EPICENTER OF THE ARMENIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I GLENDALE CONTINUES TO BE THE CENTER OF- I MEAN THE VIBRANT ARMENIAN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY AND I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT- GLENDALE- THERE ARE MULTIPLE SHOPS GROCERY STORES BAKERIES DELIS. OF POLITICIANS COMMUNITY LEADERS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS- IT IS A VIBRANT A VIBRANT COMMUNITY THAT'S IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA. AND VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND OBVIOUSLY TO THE TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OVER HERE- PROMOTING THIS RESOLUTION- THERE ARE. DUAL IMMERSION LANGUAGE SCHOOLS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO IN PRODUCING THE ARMENIAN LANGUAGE NOT ONLY TO ARMENIAN STUDENTS BUT TO NOT ARMENIAN STUDENTS- THE ARMENIAN CAUCUS- THIS YEAR IN ITS- SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. MANY OF THE WINNERS WERE NON ARMENIAN SO THAT THE SPREAD OF ESPRIT DE CORPS AND THE SPREAD OF THE COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT. AND WITH IN THAT VIBRANCY THERE ARE MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS AND MANY RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT WHO ARE FROM IT'S UNIQUE. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS REAL CONNECTION. FROM CALIFORNIA TO THIS REGION MANY OF THEM HAVE FAMILY FRIENDS- ACR ONE OF FIVE WILL BE CONNECTING AND BE THE BRIDGE INVITING PEOPLE FROM THE PROVINCE OF SYUNIK TO JOIN CALIFORNIAN THE SISTER STATE. RELATIONSHIP UNTIL OBVIOUSLY JANUARY TWENTY ONE JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX IT WILL FURTHER PROMOTE THE PROSPERITY OF BOTH REGIONS AND IMPROVE INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING. OF AND GOOD WILL IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE MUTUAL BENEFICIAL EDUCATION ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WAS A HARD YEAR FOR ARMENIA AND ARTSAKH. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE ARTSAKH WAR. ON THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED THE FORTY FOUR DAY WAR WE'RE NOT PEACEFUL EITHER- THERE CONTINUE TO BE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES BEING RAISED THERE CONTINUES TO BE PRISONERS OF WAR. THAT ARE BEING HELD- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO STAND WITH THE COMMUNITY THE PROVINCE OF SYUNIK BEING LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERNMOST SIDE OF ARMENIA WAS THE TARGET OF AN ADVANCEMENT OF THE ARTS VERY MILITARY FORCES. I SAW FIRST HAND WHEN I WAS IN AUG DOWN. THE IS VERY TANKS THAT WERE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARTSAKH ARMY WHO WERE DEFENDING THEIR HOMELAND. THIS WAS A TRAGEDY THAT WE SHOULD ALL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE- THE AS ARIE'S SEASON ENTIRE SERVE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE AZERBAIJANI MILITARY BREACH TO OTHER SECTIONS OF THE BORDER. MOVING TOWARD THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OCCUPIED MORE AREAS OF THE SOVEREIGN TERRITORY. OF THE REPUBLIC ARMENIA. ALTHOUGH WITH RUSSIAN MEDIA'S MEDIATION ARE YOUR FOR JOHN AGREED TO WITHDRAW TO THEIR PRE MAY TWELFTH POSITIONS ARMENIA REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE STILL AZERBAIJANI SOLDIERS REMAINING ILLEGALLY. IN SCENIC IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I INTRODUCED SB THREE OH TWO TO REESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA ARMENIAN TRADE OFFICE. IN HOPES OF BUILDING A VIBRANT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THIS YEAR- I HELPED NEGOTIATE WITH PERSON STIRS THEIR HISTORIC ACTION. TO CHANGE THEIR INVESTMENT POLICY IN TURKEY BECAUSE TURKEY HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THESE EFFORTS. RATHER THAN RE ESTABLISH OUR TRADE OFFICE- THE GOVERNOR CHOSE TO NEGOTIATE M. O. U. WITH ARMENIA TO ESTABLISH A TRADE DESK IN YEREVAN BETWEEN CALIFORNIA. AND IMPACT OF AND THAT WAS SIGNED EARLIER THIS YEAR SO CALIFORNIA'S DOING MANY MANY IMPORTANT THINGS TO RESPECT THE VIBRANT ARMENIAN COMMUNITY. AND THIS RESOLUTION WILL CONTINUE TO VERIFY OUR COMMITMENT NOT JUST TO ARMENIA AND ARMENIANS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE SPIRIT OF ARMENIANS AROUND THE WORLD AND CERTAINLY OUR HEART GOES OUT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR TALK AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AS WELL. AND JOIN ME IN JUST SAYING HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS MEASURE FORWARD INTO INVITING MYSELF AS WELL AS THE SENATOR TO JOIN HIM IN IN THIS EFFORT I VERY MUCH VALUE YOUR WORK VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE. AND WANTED TO SPEAK UP ON IT SO THANK YOU- THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR PORTRAYING A GREAT CHRONOLOGY OF- BOTH LONG TERM AS WELL AS VERY IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM EVENTS THAT HAVE A- DEVASTATED THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY AND UP ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT- GIVEN WHAT A HOT IT IS IN CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES AREA HOW IT'S IMPACTED MANY INDIVIDUALS NOT BECAUSE A FAMILY MEMBER OR RELATIVE STILL LIVING THERE BUT BECAUSE OF HOW IT'S BEING VIEWED AS A RECURRING THEME. OF THE NEIGHBORS THAT SURROUND ARMENIA- JUST THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT A BRIEF HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS AGO- THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ERADICATE. AN INDIGENOUS POPULATION LIVING IN AN AREA THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS. AND- WHILE THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS HAVE SEEN MANY SHIFTING POLITICAL TIDES SOVIET UNION WAS ESTABLISHED SANMINA FELL UNDER THE UMBRELLA- OF THE SOVIET UNION- AND THEN GAINED INDEPENDENCE SINCE BEEN INDEPENDENT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT'S BEEN STRIVING TO BECOME A PARTNER OF THE UNITED STATES IT'S BEEN TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES HEALTH CARE ISSUES TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS GIVEN THAT IT'S A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY. AND IT HASN'T KNOWN EXACTLY HOW TO SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATELY WORK WITH ITS NEIGHBORS BECAUSE OF ITS NEIGHBORS DON'T REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH. THEY STILL HAVE THE IDEA AND CONCEPT OF ERADICATING IT AND HE TOOK THOSE STEPS JUST LAST FALL. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD PANDEMIC WHICH WE'VE NOT EXPERIENCED. IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. SEVERITY OF WHICH WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED- AND DURING THE TIME OF A BUT MINUTES US ADMINISTRATION THAT DID NOT NECESSARILY CARE ABOUT. WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO THIS TINY POPULATION THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH AND IS A STE POTENTIALLY A VERY STRONG ALLY OF OUR COUNTRY SO. AS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT HERE DURING THE GENOCIDE COMMEMORATION MONTH OF APRIL AND SUPPORTING THE ARMENIAN. GENOCIDE RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALSO EVERYONE. I BELIEVE ALMOST EVERY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE ONE MEMBER WHO WASN'T ELECTED AT THE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN VOTING TO SUPPORT THE DIVESTMENT BILL. WHICH GOVERNOR NEWSOM ALSO SIGNED WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT THE MORAL COMPASS OF OUR STATE IS WE'RE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY STILL HELD TO OUTDATED GEOPOLITICAL AND OIL INTERESTS. AND SO IT FOCUSES ON NARROWLY CONSTRUCTED PARADIGMS. OF PAST GENERATIONS. AND SO UNTIL OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMES TO A PLACE WHERE IT REALIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ALLIANCES WITH COUNTRIES THAT BELIEVE IN THE SAME DEMOCRATIC. FREEDOMS AND IDEAS ESPOUSE THE SAME IDEAS THAT ALSO WANT TO SEE A WORLD WHERE WE ADDRESS CLIMATE ISSUES WE ADDRESS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS WE ADDRESS HEALTH CARE CONCERNS AND ISSUES- IT'S CRITICAL FOR STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA TO SOMETIMES STEP UP AND FILL THAT VOID. OUT SO AS AS SOMEONE WHO- HAS A GREAT HONOR OF BEING IN OFFICE AND REPRESENT MY DISTRICT- BUT ALSO BEING- THE THIRD GENERATION ARMENIAN WHO IN THE LAST HUNDRED AND TEN YEARSOF THOSE THREE GENERATIONS MY FAMILY HAS HAD TO MOVE FOUR TIMES WHETHER BECAUSE OF THE GENOCIDE THE STALINIST PURGES THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OR THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WAR WITH IRAQ WHICH LED ME AT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES- I DON'T SEE IT AS AN ARMENIAN AMERICAN BUT- AS- A- CALIFORNIAN. WHO WANTS TO SUPPORT OTHER COUNTRIES. WHO UNFORTUNATELY ARE BEING BULLIED AND THE MEDIA COVERAGE IS FAILING TO REALLY ADDRESS WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. SO WE NEED TO BE RECOGNIZING THAT TAKING STEPS TO SUPPORT AND THE MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE SAY NEVER AGAIN. AT IT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER FOR ENTERTAINING THIS MIGHT MEASURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY MISTER MODERATOR I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE AMBASSADOR ARMEN BY PORTION ON THE LINE VIDEO LINE WITH US WHO LIKE TO DRESS THE COMMITTEE ON ACR ONE OH FIVE.
