POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M THE

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:39.777
FIRST. POINT THAT I WANT TO

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:42.113
MAKE IS THAT. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.182
INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH FOR

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.117
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THIS IS A

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.986
SLIDE THAT SHOWS YOU THE CHANGE

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.888
IN THE BOTTOM THIRD TIER OF

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.056
HOUSE VALUES. WHICH ARE

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.625
GENERALLY CONSIDERED MORE ENTRY

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.827
LEVEL HOMES. AND YOU CAN SEE

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.328
THAT IN CITIES LIKE SAN

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:59.063
FRANCISCO EVEN ENTRY LEVEL

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.865
HOMES NOW ARE SELLING FOR OVER

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:03.101
A MILLION DOLLARS- IN LOS

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:04.769
ANGELES AND OAKLAND THE ENTRY

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.739
LEVEL HOME IS. TOPPING SIX

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.107
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:11.609
SO ONE CHALLENGE WE FACE IN

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:12.577
EXPANDING ACCESS TO

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:15.113
HOMEOWNERSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.881
PRICE OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:19.684
AND THE LACK OF- MODERATE-

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.252
SUPPLIED MODERATE COST THE

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.688
PLIGHT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:27.392
OPPORTUNITIES. WE SEE THIS IN

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.394
MANIFESTING IN LOWER AND LOWER

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.862
ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.830
PARTICULARLY FOR MODERATE AND

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:35.200
MEDICAL INCOME FAMILIES. THIS

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.969
SLIDE SHOWS YOU THE CHANGE AND-

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:39.637
HOME SALES TO BORROWERS AT

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.806
DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS AT 80%

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:45.043
A 100% AND A 120% OF A. M. I.

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.811
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ALMOST

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:48.613
EVERY LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.414
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.649
SACRAMENTO AND FRESNO. WE SEEN

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:54.419
A DECLINE IN OUR FAMILIES WHO

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:55.620
ARE EARNING AROUND THE MEDIAN

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.956
INCOME BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

00:30:58.022 --> 00:31:00.225
HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE DECLINES ARE

00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:01.693
EVEN PRONOUNCED AMONG THOSE WHO

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:04.662
ARE AT A 120% A IN MY IN A LOT

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:08.666
OF OUR COASTAL CITIES. I THINK

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.668
A BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.837
GRAYSON REFER TO THIS BUT WE

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.405
SEE THIS ALSO MANIFEST IN

00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:16.407
SEVERE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:17.275
WHO HAS ACCESS TO

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:18.910
HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE BLACK

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.278
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE TODAY IN

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.680
CALIFORNIA'S JUST AROUND THIRTY

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.649
SIX PERCENT- THIRTY POINTS

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.117
LOWER THAN THAT FOR NON

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:28.052
HISPANIC WHITES BUT WE ALSO SEE

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:31.189
SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.991
HISPANIC LIVE NEXT POPULATION.

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.759
I'M THE ASIAN A HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.494
RATE IS HIGHER BUT I WILL SAY

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.162
THAT FOR SOME ASIAN SUB

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:39.564
COMMUNITIES WE ALSO SEE

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:41.099
SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO

THE ROOT CAUSES I WOULD ARGUE%

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.911
THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF FALL

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:55.913
ALONG THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.082

00:31:58.149 --> 00:32:00.718
BENEFITS CONTINUUM. I'M GOING

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:01.853
EVERYWHERE FROM CREDIT SCORES

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.122
AND WEALTH TO MORTGAGE ACCESS

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:05.123
TO APPRAISALS TO

00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:07.358
SUSTAINABILITY. TO GIVE YOU

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:09.894
JUST A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.797
HERE- IN CALIFORNIA THE NETWORK

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.931
FOR NON HISPANIC WHITE

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:16.467
HOUSEHOLDS IS THREE HUNDRED

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:16.968
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:20.071
COMPARED TO ONLY FIFTY FIVE

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:20.638
THOUSAND FOUR HOUSEHOLDS OF

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:21.839
COLOR. WE KNOW THAT BLACK

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.274
BORROWERS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.876
LOWER MEDIAN FIKE OF CREDIT

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.844
SCORES ARE COMPARED TO NON

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.446
HISPANIC WHITE BORROWERS A

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.715
DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT SEVENTY

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.349
FIVE POINTS WHICH IS

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:33.384
SUBSTANTIAL. THEY'RE ALSO MUCH

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.119
LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A CREDIT

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:37.255
SCORE ABOUT 21% OF BLACK

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.790
POPULATION HAS NO CREDIT SCORE

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.892
COMPARED TO ABOUT 12% OF NON

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.494
HISPANIC WHITES. EXCLUSIONARY

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.663
ZONING HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.165
APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:48.933
CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS LESS

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.868
THAN 5% OF LOANS GO TO BLACK

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:53.538
HOME BUYERS. WE KNOW THAT

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:55.073
MORTGAGE ACCESS AND DENIAL

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.507
RATES ARE HIGHER FOR BLACKS AND

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.810
HISPANICS FOR BLACKS DENIAL

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.278
RATES ARE TWICE THAT FOR NON

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.748
HISPANIC WHITES- AT 16% AND FOR

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:05.950
HISPANICS- THE DENIAL RATE IS

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:09.887
12% I'M THIS ALSO PLAYS OUT IN

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:12.323
PRICING OF MORTGAGES ON AVERAGE

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.125
BLACK HOMEOWNERS ARE PAYING

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:14.859
THIRTY THREE BASIS POINTS

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.894
HIGHER IN THEIR MORTGAGES THAN

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:19.230
NON HISPANIC WHITE HOMEOWNERS.

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:20.798
AT THIS TRANSLATES INTO

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:22.467
DIFFERENT TAX BENEFITS BOTH THE

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.102
MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX DEDUCTION

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:25.169
AND PROP THIRTEEN

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.604
DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.072
HIGHER INCOME NON HISPANIC

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:30.074
WHITES AND THOSE WHO OWN THEIR

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.910
HOMES LONGER. APPRAISALS I

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.011
THINK THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.013
RETENTION RECENTLY- HOMES IN

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.048
BLACK NIGHBORHOODS ARE UNDER

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:39.584
VALUED BY AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.852
FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.687
AND HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR DUE TO

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.155
HIGHER LABOR MARKET RISK AND

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:45.456
LOWER SAVINGS ARE MUCH MORE

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:46.591
LIKELY TO FALL OUT OF

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:48.092
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND NOT BE ABLE

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:50.328
TO SUSTAIN THE HOMES THAT THEY

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.598
ARE ABLE TO GET INTO. WHAT ARE

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.400
THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS JUST

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:58.403
VERY BRIEFLY A COVERT NINETEEN

00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:00.304
IS HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.340
IMPACT ON HOMEOWNERS OF COLOR.

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:03.741
WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE THE SAME

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.443
LEVELS OF FOR CLOSURE AS WE SAW

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.445
AFTER THE LAST CRISIS IN PART

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.480
DUE TO FORBEARANCE PROGRAMS AND

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.848
IN PART BECAUSE HOUSING VALUES

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:12.550
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GONE UP

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:13.851
MEANING THAT HOMEOWNERS IN

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:15.453
DISTRESS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.622
TO SELL THEIR HOMES. I'M BUT

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.123
THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.658
IMPLICATIONS FOR RACIAL

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.059
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES AND

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.762
SUSTAINABILITY AND SO ONE IS TO

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.230
THINK ABOUT A RESCUE FUND TO

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:27.632
SUPPORT HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:29.100
STAY IN THEIR HOMES BUT WHO ARE

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:30.368
FACING LONG TERM INCOME

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.769
DISRUPTIONS DUE TO COPE AT

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:33.971
NINETEEN. UP WE DO HAVE

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:36.240
EVIDENCE AND- EXAMPLES OF THESE

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:38.309
KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND THEY SHOW

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:40.311
THAT THEY BOTH HELP PEOPLE KEEP

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:42.447
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME AND ALSO-

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:44.482
IMPROVE SUBSEQUENT EMPLOYMENT

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:47.452
OUTCOMES. OVER THE LONGER TERM

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:48.619
WE NEED TO EXPAND PRODUCTION

00:34:48.686 --> 00:34:49.887
AND THE SUPPLY OF MODERATE AND

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.689
MEDICAL MIDDLE INCOME A MARKET

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.991
RATE HOUSING- THE SUPPLY ISSUE

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:55.927
HERE IS CLEARLY RELATED TO

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:58.429
HOMEOWNERSHIP GAPS. AND WE NEED

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.564
A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.631
ADDRESSING RACIAL AND IN

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:01.999
PARTICULAR BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:04.502
GAPS. THERE I THINK WE COULD

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.770
THINK ABOUT A BACKSTOP OR

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.271
GUARANTEE FOR LOW COST MORTGAGE

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:10.208
ORIGINATIONS PERHAPS DELIVER

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.076
THROUGH CDF EYES IN THE STATE.

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:13.444
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.012
TO THINK ABOUT OUR LOW COST

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.547
FINANCING PRODUCT TO SUPPORT

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:18.082
TENANT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:20.251
PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE IN A

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:22.420
LOT OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:23.321
THEN I THINK WE NEED MUCH

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:25.022
STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND AUDIT OF

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:27.391
PRACTICES TRANSPARENCY IN BOTH

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:28.626
CREDIT SCORING AN APPRAISAL

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:30.962
ALGORITHMS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.864
CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.999
AREN'T PLAYING OUT IN- THOSE

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.235
MECHANISMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.970
LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.304
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:41.506

LARA- TEN TODAY I'M ACTUALLY

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.357
GONNA DISCUSS- A TAIL END OF

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:36.561
WHAT CARE. OF CARE- CAROLINE

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.296
ARE YEAH CAROLINE ARE

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:40.431
GODLINESS- DISCUSSED EARLIER-

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.033
AND I'M GONNA FOCUS MORE ON

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:43.568
MORTGAGE ACCESS STILL A MAJOR

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.336
CONVENTION OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AS

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:48.239
ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR MINORITIES

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.174
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.309
SO LOOKING AT A VERY SIMILAR

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.977
DATA SAID THAT CAROLINE USED

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:55.446
OUT FOR HER TABLES AND FIGURES-

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.148
I'M GONNA DISCUSS THE TWO

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:57.915
THOUSAND THE READ MORE RECENT

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.951
TRENDS AS IT RELATES TO. OUR

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.586
MORTGAGE ACCESS FOR MINORITY

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:02.453
BORROWERS IN THE STATE OF

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.590
CALIFORNIA AND SO IN TWO

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:06.223
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR LOOKING AT

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.025
THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:08.960
HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACT

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:12.330
DATA- THAT- INCORPORATES ALL

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:13.297
80% OF ALL MORTGAGES IN

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.266
CALIFORNIA WE WERE STARTING TO

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.701
SEE LARGE ETHNO RACIAL

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.636
DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.571
MORTGAGE CREDIT ARE SIMILAR TO

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:21.539
THE LEVEL THAT WE SAW ACTUALLY

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:24.342
PRE. THE GREAT RECESSION FROM

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:27.278
200-042-2000 SIX IN FACT IN TWO

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:28.012
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND TWO

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.246
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN- WE'RE

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.048
BEGINNING TO SEE THAT LATIN

00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:34.752
ACCENT BLACK HOME SEEKERS-

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.621
OBTAINABLE A HIGH COST AND-

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.789
OBTAIN A HIGH COST LOAN ABOUT

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:41.292
20% OF THE TIME UP RELATIVE TO

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.927
ASIAN WHITE BORROWERS THAT ONLY

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:44.528
GET A HIGH COST PHONE AT ABOUT

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.130
10% OF THE TIME. THIS IS

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.199
STARTING TO RESEMBLE THE TRENDS

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:49.734
THAT WE STARTED TO SEE OR THE

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.402
TRENDS THAT WE SAW PRE THE

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:52.703
GREAT RECESSION OR DURING THE

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:57.208
HOUSING. BUBBLE AROUND THE

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:58.542
COUNTRY. IN A- TO THAT- WERE

00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:59.577
ALSO STAR TO SEE THIS ALARMING

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:02.046
TREND FOR LOW INCOME BORROWERS.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.949
AS THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY-

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.618
ALMOST. CHEST AND IT'S NOT 20%

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:09.787
OFF 15% MORE LIKELY TO GET HIGH

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.355
COST LOAN IN HIGH INCOME

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:12.923
BORROWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.457
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:15.526
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVELS- WE SEE AN

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:18.396
EVEN LARGER TREND AS BLACK AND

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.331
BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS. ARE LATINO

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:22.099
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AGAIN MORE

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.401
LIKELY TO ABSORB THESE HIGH

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.936
COST LOANS SIMILAR SIMILAR TO

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.204
THE TRANS PRE THE GREAT

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.507
RECESSION. IN FACT WHEN WE LOOK

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:30.241
AT PREDOMINATE MINORITY

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:33.277
COMMUNITIES. ABOUT 20% OF ALL

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.312
LOANS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:38.215
NOW HIGH COST LOANS. RELATIVE

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.784
TO A COMPARED TO ABOUT 10% IN

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.820
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE COMMUNITIES

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.622
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.624
INSTEAD OF FINALLY WHEN WE LOOK

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.658
AT LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.759
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.261
CALIFORNIA. WE SEE THE SAME

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:53.197
TREND. AS IT RELATES TO ETHNO

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.032
RACIAL DISPARITIES. IN

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.268
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN TERMS OF

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:59.303
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN WE

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.706
THINK ABOUT ACCESS TO GO TO

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:03.541
HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE LARGEST

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:04.975
VEHICLE FOR GENERATING THIS

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:05.810
WEALTH IS TO THE MORTGAGE

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.745
MARKET. AND SO WE HAVE TO START

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:11.248
TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT WAYS ONE

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:13.350
AS CARILLO AS AS- I KEEP MONEY

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.686
SAFE CATALINA A CARELESS.

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:18.589
DISCUSSED IS WE NEED TO START

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.991
SLOWING DOWN THE APPRECIATION

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.060
OF HOMES UP BECAUSE OF THE

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.162
ETHNO RACIAL WEALTH GAP OF

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.834
YOU IT'S JUST A SIMPLY BECOMING

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.135
LESS AND LESS AFFORDABLE FOR

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.037
THOSE GROUPS AND SO FIGURING

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:35.172
OUT WAYS TO SLOW DOWN- THIS

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:36.941
TYPE OF APPRECIATION WOULD HAVE

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.809
DRAMATIC EFFECTS BECAUSE-

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.245
MINORITIES ARE UTILIZING OR

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:43.114
OBTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF HIGH

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.882
COST LOANS. THAT ARE JUST MUCH

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.851
MORE PROBLEMATIC OF FOR THE

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.953
LONG TERM- PROSPECT OF

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:49.987

PERTAINS TO COLBY. WE MAY NOT

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:00.464
SEE IT AS HIGH LEVELS OF

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:01.532

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:04.034

VERY LARGE LONG TRM EFFECTS OF

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:08.172

TODAY'S HUESO HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.785
DISPARITIES ARE THE RESULT OF A

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.220
TROUBLED HISTORY OF RACISM AND

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:04.555
DISCRIMINATION IN THE MORTGAGE

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.390
ECOSYSTEM. IN FACT THE BLACK

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:07.992
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IS STILL AT

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:09.793
LEVELS SIMILAR TO WHERE IT WAS

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.928
FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE

COLOR. THE DISPARITY IN HOME

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:26.310
OWNERSHIP IS A MAIN DRIVER OF

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.711
THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. THE

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.246
MEDIAN WHITE FAMILY HAS TEN

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.648

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.522
THROUGH FEDERALLY SUPPORTED

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:39.924
INVESTMENTS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.759
AND WE'RE DEVASTATED BY THE TWO

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:42.893
THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.261
WHEN BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:48.332

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:51.235
THE PAINFUL BACKDROP UP TO THE

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:52.670

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.170
WHICH IS WORSE THAN TE

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:54.705
ECONOMIC INEQUALITY IN THIS

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.273

THE INLAND EMPIRE AND CENTRAL

VALLEY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.675
THERE ARE RACIAL DISPARITIES

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.377
AND WHO HAS STRUGGLED TO KEEP

UP WITH MORTGAGE PAYMENTS

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.579
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THAT

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:10.114
BLACK HOMEOWNERS HAVE BASED

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.582
GREATER HARDSHIP IN DOING SO.

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.984
OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE MUST

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:14.885
LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE PAST

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:16.754
AND TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT THE

FURTHER WIDENING OF THE RACIAL

WEALTH GAP. AS HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.624
DISPARITIES ARE ESSENTIAL

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.292
BECAUSE THE LONG TERM EQUITY.

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.061

HAVE A QUESTION FOR MISS

00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:59.997
TOURISM WHAT OF WHAT CAN

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.665
CALIFORNIA DO TO ENSURE THAT

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.802
LOW INCOME CONSUMERS HAVE

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:08.238
GREATER ACCESS TO LENDING. AND

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:09.807
REASONABLE THE COURSE BECAUSE

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:13.077
CREDIT IS STILL A VERY REAL

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.546
ISSUE- AND UNDERSERVED AND

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:17.414
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO WHAT

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.283
CAN WE DO IN TERMS OF GETTING

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:22.753
ACCESS TO LENDING. SURE SO I

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.455
THINK THAT- WE DO NEED MORE

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:29.093
TARGETED AID SPECIFICALLY- TO

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.261
OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION IN THE

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:31.995
HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY TO

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.997
START WITH- RESEARCH FROM

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:34.731
FREDDIE MAC IN THE URBAN

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.433
INSTITUTE DEMONSTRATES THAT

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.267
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF MARKETS

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:40.070
READY. FARMERS OF COLOR TODAY

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.438
BASED ON THE CURRENT CREDIT

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.406
SCORES AND THEIR DEBT TO INCOME

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.842
RATIOS BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:45.742
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DOWN

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.344
PAYMENT SO THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.345
OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.314
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST- BUT THEY

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.682
COULD BE MORE TARGETED

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.283
ESPECIALLY TO GET. THESE FUNDS

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.585
INTO THE HANDS OF FIRST

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.019
GENERATION HOME BUYERS SO

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.454
PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.123
AND YOU KNOW IN THEIR AND THEIR

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.290
FAMILIES TO HAVE THIS

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.592
OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW THAT BLACK

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.727
AND BROWN FARMERS GENERALLY DO

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:05.395
NOT COME FROM FAMILIES. THAT

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.531
HAVE LEGACIES OF BUILDING AND

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.166
PASSING ON INTERGENERATIONAL

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.801
WEALTH AND SO TARGETING

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.035
ASSISTANCE OF THIS POPULATION

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.071
WOULD HELP TO ENSURE CONSUMERS

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.806
WHO ARE MORTGAGE READY TODAY

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:16.874
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.809
AS WELL. BUT IN ADDITION TO

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.110
THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:21.211
TO CONSIDER HOW A PERSON

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.746
BECOMES HOME BUYER READY IN THE

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:25.015
FIRST PLACE AND THIS IS RELATED

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:25.916
TO THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.384
CREDIT SYSTEM. BEFORE THEY

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.719
MIGHT EVEN BE CONSIDERING

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:30.754
BUYING A HOUSE SO STARTING FROM

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:31.722
FROM VERY YOUNG AGES ONCE

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:32.756
SOMEONE STARTS INTERACT WITH

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:35.125
CREDIT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:35.692
THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON THE

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.828
MARKET- ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:39.463
HELP BUILD THEM UP FOR SUCCESS

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.631
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:43.800
ACCESS ACCESS TO CREDIT OUR

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.468
PRODUCTS LIKE SMALL DOLLAR

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.869
LOANS THAT THESE ARE NOT

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.437
SETTING UP CONSUMERS FOR

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:48.572
FAILURE AND THEN A LARGER

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.374
ECOSYSTEM OF CREDIT CANNOT BE

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.242
PREDATORY AND SETTLING PEOPLE

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.944
WITH YEARS OF DEBT THAT THEY

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.179
CAN'T GET OUT OF. AND IT IS

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.980
HARMING THEIR CREDIT AND THEN

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:57.881
POSITION THEM NOT POSITIONING

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.383
THEM IN A WAIT TO BE HOME BUYER

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:00.851
READY SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.718
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE OTHER

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:03.420
ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED. TO

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.722
CREDIT AND NOT JUST- IN THE

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:07.491
MORTGAGE SPACE SPECIFICALLY AND

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:09.693
THEN. SHE'S LIKE STUDENT AT

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.762
WHICH IS A HUGE SORRY A HUGE

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.363
BARRIER TO HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.165
MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS- AND

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.967
THIS REALLY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:17.701
BECAUSE RATHER THAN LIFTING

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:25.209
PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. AND

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:25.809
PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:26.910
CLASS ASK YOU KNOW THE STUDENT

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:28.412
IS THAT FURTHER ENTRENCH. THE

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.113
RACIAL WEALTH. AND PREPARE IN

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.215
THIS OF POVERTY THAT IS RESULT.

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.150
FROM THE- LACK OF. TO AND CAP.

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.518
INTO FOUR CREDIT. SO WE NEED

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:35.953
BOLD ACTION SUCH AS ACROSS THE

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.455
BOARD STUDENT DEBT FORGIVENESS-

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.656
IN ORDER TO REALLY GET TO THE

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.358
HEART OF WHAT IS KEEPING. SO

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.827
MANY PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:45.996

GUARANTEED GOVERNMENT BACKSTOP.

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.471
YOU COULD DELIVER ACCESS TO

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.172
THAT THAT COULD BE TO ANY OF

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:58.048
THE PANELISTS. SO I WOULD SAY

00:51:58.114 --> 00:52:00.217
ABSOLUTELY I WOULD ALSO SAY

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.052
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.054
MOST ROBUST COMMUNITY

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.088
DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:07.591
INSTITUTION THAT WORKS. AND

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.726
PARTNERING WITH THEM TO SORT OF

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.595
GET THESE CREDIT PRODUCTS-

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.497
RESPONSIBLE LOANS TO

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.598
COMMUNITIES I THINK IS A IS A

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:18.668
VERY- STRONG MODEL THAT WE'RE

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:19.569
USING IN THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.171
SPACE WITH A CALIFORNIA

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.406
REBUILDING FUND AND SO MAYBE

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:24.708
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.743
OF A SIMILAR FUND. BUT DIRECTED

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.045
SPECIFICALLY AT HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.814
FOR FIRST TIME AND OTHER- AS

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.349
LOW INCOME OR BORROWERS OF

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:38.021
COLOR. I AM I WOULD SECOND

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.456
THOSE CALL- COMMUNITY

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.056
DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:42.092
INSTITUTIONS ARE MISSION DRIVEN

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:44.728
BUT INSTITUTIONS- AND SUPPORT

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.563
FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AGAIN WE

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.864
KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.332
MORTGAGE READY BARBERS AND THE

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.167
ONLY. THING BLOCKING THEM FROM

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.936
BECOMING HOMEOWNERS IS THAT

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.771
DOWN PAYMENT- AND SO I THINK

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.640
THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.775
SUPPORT THE WORK OF CDFI IS TO

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.644
GET- RESPONSIBLY STRUCTURED

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.479
LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS INTO

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.246
THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:05.649
READY. I WOULD ALSO GO A LONG

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:07.183
WAY IN HELPING TO CLOSE THE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.086
WEALTH GAP IN TERMS OF

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:12.055
HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY.

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:14.691
THANK YOU FOR THAT I THERE WAS

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:16.259
ONE OTHER ISSUE AREA AND

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.128
RESEARCHERS AT. THAT BURKE WAS

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:20.430
OFFERING PLAN BELONG INSTITUTE.

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.265
FOUND THAT CITIES WITH HIGH

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.034
LEVELS OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.535
OFTEN DISPLAY PATTERNS OF

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:28.271
SOCIAL. ECONOMIC AND RACIAL

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:30.607
EXCLUSION. SO HOW DOES THE

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.409
STATE'S LACK OF DIVERSE HOUSING

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:34.277
CONTRIBUTE- OR AT LEAST THE

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.146
TYPES OF HOUSING CONTRIBUTE TO

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.781
THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:40.150
HOMEOWNERSHIP- I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.552
ASKING. EVEN MORE DETAIL AS-

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:43.753
COULD THE CONSTRUCTION OF FOUR

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.989
PLEXUS COTTAGE TOWARDS TWN

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:49.025
HOUSES. OF WHICH ARE MORE

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.427
NATURALLY AFFORDABLE TO A

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:51.861
BROADER RANGE OF CALIFORNIANS

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:54.197
PROMOTE A MORE DIVERSE HOME

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:56.333
OWNERSHIP PATTERN WHICH

00:53:56.399 --> 00:54:01.705
ADDRESSES GENERATIONAL WEALTH.

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:04.274
SO ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.076
IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:08.578
CALIFORNIA TO ALSO FOCUS ON THE

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.914
SUPPLIES PIECE- AS I MENTIONED

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.682
IN MY REMARKS ABOUT THREE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:13.483
QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.452
NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE ALMOST NO

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:16.920
LENDING TO BLACK FAMILIES

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:19.322
WHATSOEVER. AND EXCLUSIONARY

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.524
ZONING PRACTICES THAT NOT ONLY

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:24.361
DICTATE ONLY SINGLE FAMILY

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:25.528
ZONING BUT THAT ALSO DICTATE OF

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:28.932
MINIMUM LOT SIZES OR- SORT OF

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.334
SCHOOL DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:32.469
AROUND SETBACKS ANOTHER ZONING

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.804
REQUIREMENTS REALLY LIMITS WHAT

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.539
KIND OF STOCK IS BUILT AND THE

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.575
AFFORDABILITY OF THAT STOCK-

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.510
AND SO I THINK- EFFORTS THAT

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.911
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE TO

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.947
INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.849
TO REDUCE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.951
PRACTICES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:50.020
PARTS OF THE PUZZLE I THINK

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:51.121
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:53.556
SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:56.993
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.195
IMPLEMENT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:00.697
THOSE OWNING REFORMS IN A WAY

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:03.199
THAT'S NOT EXTRACTED SO THAT IT

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:05.635
DOESN'T BECOME ANOTHER WAY OF-

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.037
SORT OF SPECULATIVE CAPITAL

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.838
COMING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.674
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT ZONING

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.277
AND CAUSING. ADDITIONAL

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.346
CONCERNS AROUND DISPLACEMENTS.

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.081
YEAH IN ADDITION TO- CAROLINE

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.083
DESCRIBED- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.484
UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE WE HAVE

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.086
THESE THAT THE PLANNING

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.055
REGULATIONS ARE ARE OFTEN DONE

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.556
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.091
IMPORTANT TO- TO CREATE AN

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.560
ALMOST. EVEN FOR EQUAL PLAYING

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.995
FIELD ACROSS DIFFERENT REGION

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.229
THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.497
OFTEN SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:35.598
THERE MIGHT BE AN INCREASE IN

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.801
SUPPLY- A LOT OF THE- POOR

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:39.836
QUALITY HOUSING IS MORE LIKELY

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.538
TO DEVELOP IN. MINORITY

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:42.939
COMMUNITIES AND SO WE HAVE TO

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.607
FIND WAYS TO NOT ONLY PRODUCE

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:48.912
MORE HOUSING- BUT TO BE HONEST-BETTER QUALITY HOUSING. WHAT

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.180
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:51.815
EVEN THOUGH WE MAY WANT TO

00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:52.482
DEGRADE OUR INCREASED

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:55.585
PRODUCTION. BY THE BY I'M SO

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:58.188
NEEDS- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO AT

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:00.023
TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT COMMUNITY

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.124
SO THAT SO THAT STARTING

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:01.825
COMMUNITIES DONNA SAID

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.593
ESSENTIALLY OPT OUT OF THE-

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.196
REQUIREMENTS. AT THE STATE

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:10.567
LEVEL. THE ANSWERS TO THE

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:11.735
QUESTIONS I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.236
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MYSELF. I

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:15.138
KNOW WHO. RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.207
A LOT OF ATTENTION TO RACIAL

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.742
BIAS IN THE HOME APPRAISAL

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:21.611
PROCESS- FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLES

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.413
OF. BLACK ON HOMES BEING

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.081
APPRAISED AT LOWER VALUES

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:25.849
COMPARED TO WHITE OWNED

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:28.518
PROPERTIES- WANTED TO ASK IF

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:29.919
ANY OF YOU HAVE PERSPECTIVES ON

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:30.854
POLICIES THAT WE SHOULD

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.922
CONSIDER. TO ENSURE THAT

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:35.225
APPRAISALS ARE FAIR AND FREE OF

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:42.198
BIAS. SURE WHAT WE KNOW THAT-

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.433
APPRAISAL BIAS IS ACTUALLY A

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.135
VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.337
FAIR LENDING LAWS- BUT AS YOU

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.471
MENTIONED THERE IS A GROWING

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:48.972
BODY OF RESEARCH THAT

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.640
DEMONSTRATES. THAT APPRAISAL

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:52.475
DISCRIMINATION IS A SYSTEMIC

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.911
ISSUE- AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.412
ADDRESS THE VALUATION OF HOMES

00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:58.715
TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- HOMES

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.183
THAT ARE THAT ARE OWNED BY

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.050
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT'S

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:02.285
CRITICAL TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.653
CHANGES IN THE APPRAISAL

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.355
BUSINESS MODEL. INCLUDING THE

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.190
INCREASED USE OF THE AUTOMATED

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:10.059
VALUATION MODELS WITH AN EQUITY

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:11.327
LENS- SO THERE SHOULD BE A

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:12.862
ROBUST REVIEW OF FEDERAL

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.731
PRISONS STANDARDS. INCLUDING

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:16.232
ETHICS STANDARDS INCREASE

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.234
TRAINING OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.803
FOR APPRAISERS AND EXPANDED

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:21.871
INITIATIVES TO BRING MORE

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:22.405
PRAISES OF COLOR INTO THE

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.808
FIELD- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.376
USE OF SALES COMPARISONS IN

00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:27.877
NEIGHBORHOODS CARRIES A LEGACY

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.779
OF REDLINING INTO THE PRESENT.

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.181
AND ALLOW ALSO STARKLY

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:32.115
UNDERVALUED APPRAISALS TO

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:34.684
INFLUENCE CURRENT VALUES. OF

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.685
THE APPRAISAL INDUSTRY SHOULD

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:36.820
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE MORE

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:39.322
MODELS- THAT ARE MORE EQUITABLE

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:43.593
ALTERNATIVES. TO WHAT IS

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.929
CURRENTLY BEING USED. OTHER

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:48.398
PERSPECTIVE. MAYBE OUT OF

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.233
FOLLOW UP TO THAT QUESTION YOU

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.502
REFERRED TO- WHAT I UNDERSTAND

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:53.603
IS SORT OF AN INCREASING USE OF

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.806
ALGORITHMS AND ARTIFICIAL

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:57.273
INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.142
TECHNOLOGIES ARE IN THE FIELD

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.177
WHICH MANY WONDERED IF THEY

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:03.479
ARE- SOMEHOW CONTRIBUTING TO

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.481
RACIAL DISPARITIES AND OTHER

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.716
ALSO QUESTIONS AROUND

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:07.784
CONVENTIONAL CREDIT SCORES AND

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.219
HOW THOSE NUMBERS ARE PUT

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:10.486
TOGETHER WONDERING IF YOUR

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:12.589
PERSPECTIVE ON. THE USE OF

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:13.389
THESE ALGORITHMS AND

00:58:13.456 --> 00:58:15.491
TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW CAN WE

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:18.127
ENSURE THAT- THEY THEY DON'T

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:20.330
LEAD TO RACIAL DISPARITIES.

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:21.764
SURE I'M SO TO THAT I THINK

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.166
THAT WE SHOULD BE VIGILANT

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.535
ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:27.570
AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS.

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.105
CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.807
ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.842
UNJUSTIFIED OUTCOMES IN CREDIT

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:34.310
DECISIONS ACROSS THE BOARD OF

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:35.578
AND A LOT OF TIMES IT GOES

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:37.747
WITHOUT DETECTION- WE FULLY

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:39.048
BELIEVE THAT THE REGULATORY

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.083
AGENCIES SHOUL ACTUALLY BE

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:41.517
CAREFUL NOT TO PUT FORWARD.

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:43.753
GUIDANCE THAT SUGGESTS SUPPORT

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.787
FOR INNOVATIVE MODELS OF

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.422
TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.791
THAT WITH A FAIR LENDING

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.560
INQUIRY- A LOT OF TIMES THESE

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.528
ALGORITHMIC MODELS ARE BLACK

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.430
BOXES. THAT ARE ABLE TO FORM

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:55.865
PREDICTIONS AND DECISIONS IN A

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.234
WAY THAT- ARE NOT ABLE TO

00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.969
COMMUNICATE THE REASONS FOR WHY

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:01.004
THEY MADE THOSE DECISIONS AND

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.739
SO CONSUMERS HAVE NO WAY. OF

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.307
KNOWING WHAT DATA HAS BEEN FED

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.675
INTO THE MODELS AND WHICH

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.243
FACTORS THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.678
USING A DECISION MAKING AND

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.346
INTO THEIR DETERMINATION.

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.481
WHETHER THERE ARE PROTECTED

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.682
CLASSES AND WHETHER THE

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.684
ALGORITHM HAS DENIED CREDIT

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:16.286
BASED ON A RHODIA'S OR BIASED

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.821
DATA- WE KNOW THAT A. I. HAS

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.423
BEEN AN ELDER THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.225
BEEN EXPOSED AS PROBLEMATIC IN

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.394
AREAS. INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT AND

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.796
CRIMINAL JUSTICE- AND SO I

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:27.730
THINK THAT RATHER THAN

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.666
SHIELDING ALGORITHMS FROM

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:32.201
EXAMINATION- WE REALLY NEED TO

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.304
UP TO AUDIT THEM AND TO AUTUMN

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.939
SO AUDIT THESE ALGORITHMIC

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.674
SYSTEMS. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.609
WE DO NOT PERMIT THESE MODELS

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:40.977
TO BY PASS FAIR LENDING

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:43.279
SCRUTINY SO THAT WE CAN REALLY

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:50.053
SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE-

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:50.787
BASED ON ON NEWER TECHNOLOGY.

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:52.689
THANK VERY MUCH AND OUR-

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:53.957
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE FEW

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:57.360
QUESTION. THANK YOU THE TO BOTH

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:58.394
CHAIRMAN'S FOR PULL THIS TO I

00:59:58.461 --> 00:59:59.729

MY SWEETS HERE- WHAT MICHAEL OF

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.767
ALL SET A- VERY CAN ABOUT THE

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.569
EQUITY THAT FACE. OUR

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:07.870
COMMUNITIES PARTICULAR ON

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:08.638
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND I SEE TO MY

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.872
COMMUNITY VERY DIVERSE

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.741
COMMUNITY. AND THE COMMUNITY OF

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.543
COLOR ARE CONSISTENTLY I'M

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:14.377
GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.945
BEHIND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.981
TO PROCURE AND BUY HOMES WHICH

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:18.881
IS HOW WE BUILD WEALTH IN THIS

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.417
COUNTRY- SO IT'S AN ISSUE AYE

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:22.352
AYE CARE TREMENDOUSLY ABOUT. I

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:23.186
WAS CURIOUS IF ANY THE

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.454
PANELISTS COULD ALSO SHARE

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.488
GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENED WITH

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.156
COVERT NINETEEN THE IMPACT

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.558
ECONOMICALLY ON SOME OF THESE

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:30.927
COMMUNITIES AND CAN WE- GET A

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.395
HOLD OF THIS THIS CRISIS HAS

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.396
CREATED AND HOW FAR ARE WE

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.998
BEHIND GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.366
WITH THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.500
ACQUIRING MORE HOME

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.768
HOMEOWNERSHIP PERSONALLY FOR

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:39.435
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:41.070
HARDEST HIT BALL FROM A HEALTH

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.807
PERSPECTIVE. AND FINANCIALLY

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.677
BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS. I THINK

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.879
THE IMPACT ON HISPANIC ASIAN

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:52.115
AND BLACK COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:52.949
NINETEEN IS GOING TO BE A LONG

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.917
STANDING. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.486
THINGS WE LEARNED FROM THE LAST

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:58.688
RECESSION IS THAT. IF WE WAIT

01:00:58.755 --> 01:00:59.956
TO SEE THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.891
TO BE TOO LATE. AND SO IT'S

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.426
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.561
BOLDLY NOW ABOUT HOW TO KEEP

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.430
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. UP WE

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.733
KNOW THAT- DELINQUENCIES AROUND

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.535
MORTGAGES FOR COMMUNITIES OF

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:15.204
COLOR RIGHT NOW ARE ABOUT. 45%

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.706
HIGHER THAN FOR NON HISPANIC

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.808
WHITES. I THINK THE QUESTION IS

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.610
HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN I'M

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:21.778
UNEMPLOYED HOW LONG HAD THEY

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.147
NOT HAD ACCESS TO INCOME. AND

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.314
HOW MUCH DEBT ARE THEY

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:27.517
RECRUITING. BECAUSE INEXPENSIVE

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.452
MARKET LIKE CALIFORNIA. IF YOU

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.188
HAVE A CRUDE FOUR SIX EIGHT A

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:33.990
YEAR OF ARREARS IN MORTGAGE

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.059
DEBT. IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.427
TO OVERCOME THAT. AND IT'S

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:38.828
GONNA LIVER LIMIT OTHER LIFE

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:41.030
CHANCES AND SO. ON AS I

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:41.764
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.466
REMARKS. THINKING ABOUT A

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.068
RESCUE FUNDS TO THAT FAMILIES

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:46.602
DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO SELL

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.604
THEIR HOMES UNDER INVOLUNTARY

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:51.974
CIRCUMSTANCES- AND OR- MAKING

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.144
SURE THAT THE- DEBT ISN'T. USED

01:01:55.211 --> 01:02:02.051
IN. ARE ARE TAKEN AT. YOUR-

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:02.819
THERE ISN'T SORT OF UP.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.020
RESPONSE TO THAT IS REALLY

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.557
IMPORTANT FOR RACIAL. YEAH

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.524
GOING OFF CAROLINE'S POINT I

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:11.694
THINK THAT ANOTHER ONE OF THE-

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.262
SMALL ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.097
THE GREAT RECESSION IS THAT

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.064
HOME VALUES CONTINUE TO

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.799
INCREASE AND SO A LOT OF THESE

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:20.570
FAMILIES THAT ARE- THAT- THAT

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:22.004
ARE VERY PICKY LIKE INVARIANTS

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.773
IS SENSITIVE AND PRECARIOUS

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.108
FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.309
PROBABLY GONNA BE OOKING

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.977
TOWARDS THE REFINANCE MARKET.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.812
AND SO I THINK GOING FORWARD WE

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.080
HAVE TO EXAMINE THE TYPES OF

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:33.416
PRODUCTS THAT THE STATE. AND

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.951
LOCAL- BANKING FINANCIAL

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.486
INSTITUTIONS CAN PROVIDE TO

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.221
THOSE FAMILIES. THAT ARE

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.922
NECESSARILY WHAT WE'RE

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.324
ACCUSTOMED TO IN THE PER IN THE

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.558
PAST BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.093
LARGE VOLUMES OF THESE FAMILIES

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.394
IF THEY DO WINDING STAY IN

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.797
THEIR HOMES TO KICK TO CATCH UP

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:48.831
ESSENTIALLY BASED OFF OF THE

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:49.966
FINANCIAL SITUATION THAN THE

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:50.733
FINANCIAL BURDENS OF THE

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.168
COPING. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.269
TO THE REFINANCE MARKET TO STAY

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:54.704
IN THEIR HOMES AND TO OBTAIN

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.572
SOME OF THE EQUITY THAT THEY'VE

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:57.907
BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE SO I THINK

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:00.209
LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT WAYS TO

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.811
ALLOW THESE FAMILIES TO ACCESS

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.446
SOME OF THAT EQUITIES IT IS AN

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.747
ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THE GREAT

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:08.918
RECESSION. THAT WE SAW. A TEN

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.386
OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. BUT THE-

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.888
WHERE THOSE PREDATORY PRACTICES

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.489
MIGHT EMERGE RIGHT BECAUSE WE

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:14.857
DEFINITELY SAW IN THE SUBPRIME

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:17.393
GROOM. THE FIRST RESPONSE WAS

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.928
OR THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.229
REFINANCE PRODUCTS IN LOW

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.831
INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.767
SO. AT OVERSIGHT REGULATION

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:28.538
THERE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.605
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNOUNCER

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.941
ANY FINAL QUESTIONS FROM

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.442
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M GOING TO

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.011
ASK THE PANELISTS IF YOU WANNA

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.479
MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:38.214
VERTICALLY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.383
YOU HAVE FOR US ON THIS AND ONE

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.617
THING I'LL ALSO ASK IS- YOU

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:42.718
KNOW OBVIOUSLY EVERY PART OF

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.554
THE STATE IS A BIT DIFFERENT- I

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.621
ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.456
MEMBERS ON THIS- COMMITTEE.

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.058
REPRESENT HIGH COST REGIONS IN

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.726
THE BAY AREA AND WONDERING.

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:51.327
GENERALLY DO HAVE

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:53.329
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HOPE

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.931
TO LEAVE WITH US AND- DO THESE

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:58.134
STRATEGIES LOOK. DIFFERENT FOR

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:58.734
HIGH COST REGIONS LIKE THE BAY

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:06.742
AREA. AND HAPPY FOR ANYONE TO

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.911
JUMP IN OR- WE CAN MOVE TO THE

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:15.051
NEXT PANEL. OKAY YOUR FIRST HE

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.553
FIRST SURE I'M JUST GOING TO

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.688
SAY THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.690
SURE THAT SERVICERS ARE

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.491
COMMUNICATING TO HOMEOWNERS

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.727
TODAY ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.796
THAT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.497
HOMES AND TO AVOID FORECLOSURE

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.266
WE KNOW THAT AT THE FEDERAL

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.802
LEVEL- IT AND OTHER ADVOCATES

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.503
HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR CONGRESS

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.305
TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS THAT

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.273
THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.041
AGENCY AND THE FEDERAL HOUSING

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.644
ADMINISTRATION- HAVE PROVIDED

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.079
TO PRIVATELY HELD MORTGAGES AS

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:45.581
WELL AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.616
PRIVATE LOANS SHOULD ADOPT A

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.917
FORECLOSURE MORATORIUM AND

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.885
FORBEARANCE POLICIES OFFERED BY

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:52.989
DGSE OR FHA AS WELL AS TO MERIT

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.957
THE FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS IN

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:56.425
PROVIDING CLUES FOR BAND

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.261
SOLUTIONS. THEY DO NOT INCREASE

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:00.196
BORROWERS MONTHLY PAYMENTS SO

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.764
TO THE EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.566
CAN ENSURE THAT SERVICERS ARE

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:04.734
COMMUNICATING ALL OF THAT

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.669
INFORMATION TO FARMERS- WE

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.937
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:08.804
CRITICAL AND IT'S ESPECIALLY

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.106
IMPORTANT THE FARMERS

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.841
CONSIDERED HARD TO REACH LIKE

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.576
THOSE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.810
LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.746
FARMERS ARE RECEIVING TIMELY

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.714
AND ACCURATE INFORMATION BUT I

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.583
WOULD SAY- IN ADDITION TO THIS

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.752
POLICYMAKERS MUST ALSO REALLY

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:23.519
SUPPORT THE WORK OF HOUSING

LITTLE BIT ABOUT. RACIAL

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:56.005
DISPARITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.641
RENTERS- BY AND LARGE WHEN WE

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:01.076
THINK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:02.645
HOUSING STABILITY IT'S ONE OF

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.580
THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.115
TO ENSURING THAT HOUSEHOLDS.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:08.818
CAN IMPROVE THEIR OUTCOMES WE

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:09.885
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MOBILITY

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:11.620
AND ECONOMIC STATUS SO WE CAN

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:14.457
THINK ABOUT. MOBILITY IN TERMS

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:18.060
OF- ON THE X. AXIS HERE THIS

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.628
GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT ECONOMIC

01:08:19.695 --> 01:08:21.363
STATUS FROM THE LEFT HAND SIDE

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.566
LOW INCOME TO THE RIGHT HAND

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:26.302
SIDE IS HIGH INCOME. IN THE Y.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.337
AXIS SHOWS MOBILITY AS YOU CAN

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.172
SEE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:34.210
ARE- UNFORCED OR ABLE TO MOVE

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.344
TO LOCATIONS WHEREVER THEY'D

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.946
LIKE BASED ON THEIR INCOME THEY

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:39.048
USUALLY MOVE TO. AREAS WITH

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:41.116
BETTER JOBS- ECONOMIC

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.352
IMPROVEMENTS AND ALSO IMPROVE

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.687
THEIR NETWORKS MIDDLE INCOME

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.489
FOLKS HAVE LESS MOBILITY AND ON

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.756
THE FAR LEFT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.558
FOLKS WHO HAVE FORCED MOBILITY

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.427
THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF RENTERS.

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.362
FALL IN LINE WE KNOW A LOT

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.731
ABOUT THE RIGHT TWO THIRDS BUT

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.099
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:00.469
LEFT- ORDER A FORCED MOBILE

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:03.973
HOUSEHOLDS AND SO BE- OBJECTIVE

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:06.141
OF- THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:08.110
PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW.

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:10.179
WHO IS INSIDE THIS GROUP THAT

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.580
IS FORCED TO MOVE IN OTHER

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.516
WORDS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE STABLE

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.651
HOUSING AND A LOT OF TIMES THIS

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.952
IS A LOT OF RENTERS THESE ARE

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.387
FOLKS THAT ARE FACING

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.289
INCREASING REPS AS WELL AS A

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.458
FICTION. NOW IN TERMS OF

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.093
EVICTION WE CAN KIND OF SEE

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.028
THAT THERE'S SEVERAL FACTORS

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.730
THAT PLAY A ROLE IN TO IT AT

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.797
THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL AT THE

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:30.432
BOTTOM THERE'S A TRIANGLE OF

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:34.103
INCREASING RENT. IMPACTED WITH

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:34.870
INADEQUATE WELFARE AND HOUSING

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:36.672
BURDEN. WE'RE ON TOP OF IT HAVE-

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.807
MARKET ECONOMIC. SEGREGATION

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:41.143
NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE. THAT IS

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.311
IMPACTING THE ABILITY OF

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.746
HOUSEHOLDS TO BE ABLE TO STAY

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:46.348
IN THEIR HOME. AND BE ABLE TO

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.183
MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING. BUT

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.085
BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS IDEA OF

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.253
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW ON

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.421
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AND

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.989
RENTING WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:56.325
THE HISTORY AND WHICH SEPARATED

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.793
DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS INTO

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.128
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND THIS

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.729
STARTS FROM THE POST ANTEBELLUM

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.998
CIVIL WAR. AROUND WHAT MOST

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.199
SCHOLARS CALLED THE BIRTH OF

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.168
THE GHETTO FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:07.603
NINETEEN FORTY. FROM THE

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.837
NINETEEN TENDS TO THE NINETEEN

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:10.439
SEVENTIES THERE WAS THIS PERIOD

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.640
OF THE GREAT MIGRATION OF BLACK

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.043
HOUSEHOLDS MOVING FROM JIM CROW

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:14.643
SOUTH TO THE NORTH AND TO THE

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:18.247
WEST. BUT AS THEY ENTERED INTO

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.616
THESE NEW CITIES THERE WAS A

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.217
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:24.119
OF HOUSING AS WELL AS EQUITY I

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:25.721
WON'T BELABOR THIS TOO MUCH WE

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.089
ALL HEARD ABOUT REDLINING AND

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.891
KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT. THAT

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.427
BATES- DENIED ACCESS TO FOLKS

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.928
WHO LIVED IN THESE PLACES

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:34.463
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.764
PATTERNS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.232
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:39.134
EXISTS TODAY IN TERMS OF RACIAL

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.970
SEGREGATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.104
SEE ON THE TOP THE REDLINING

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.039
MAP. SOMEWHAT MIRRORS A LITTLE

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.741
BIT OF THE RACIAL SEGREGATION

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:49.078
DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLDS IN

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:51.280
THE LA AREA. AROUND NINETEEN

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.716
FORTY TWO- NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:55.017
THERE WAS CONTINUED WHAT WAS

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.218
CALLED COLLECTIVE ACTION BREAK

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.088
RACISM WHICH INVOLVED A LOT OF-

01:10:59.154 --> 01:10:59.955
COVENANTS HOUSING COVENANTS

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.890
THAT PREVENTED- BLACK

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:04.126
INDIGENOUS- ASIAN LATIN ACTS

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:06.261
HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR. TO BE ABLE

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.863
TO MOVE INTO CERTAIN SPACES

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.264
DENYING THEM ACCESS TO

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.100
OPPORTUNITIES. WHAT THIS

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.569
ULTIMATELY DID- IT LED TO

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:14.903
ANOTHER PERIOD OF DECENTRALIZE

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.405
RACISM WHERE THE CIVIL RIGHTS

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.540
ACT TRIED TO EQUATE MORE TRIED

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.476
IMPROVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.111
DISMANTLING WITH LEGAL

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.113
SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION.

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:26.148
BUT THE LASTING EFFECTS OF

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.316
REDLINING BLOCKBUSTING

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.618
DISCRIMINATION LED TO AN

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:30.719
INCREASE IN CONCENTRATED

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:33.455
POVERTY. AND ALSO- CAN

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.858
MIGRATION OF MIDDLE CLASS-

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:36.759
BLACK HOUSEHOLDS INTO THE

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.661
SUBURBS WHITE FLIGHT AVOIDING.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:41.764
THOSE NEW NEIGHBORS THAT THEY

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.499
WERE SEEING. NOW WHAT THIS DID

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.267
AS ADULTS OF IMPACTED THE

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:47.302
OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSEHOLDS OF

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.405
COLOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.639
GROWTH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS OVER

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:51.607
THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS AS YOU

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:54.643
CAN SEE FROM 1-963-220-0016 ON

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.512
THIS GRAPH. THE WEALTH GAP

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:57.680
GREATLY INCREASE THIS IS

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:59.348
LARGELY DUE TO THE DENIAL OF

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.283
ACCESS TO OWNING A HOME. AND

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.085
FORCING HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR TO

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.620
PARTICULARLY- BLACK AND WHITE

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.395

ANALYSIS- AND PUBLISH THIS IN

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:33.135
AN ARTICLE LATE LAST YEAR. AND

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.336
THEY FOUND THAT 85% OF

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:35.837
CALIFORNIA CITIES WITH THE

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.639
LARGEST INCREASES IN BLACK

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.375
NINETY FIVE APPROVED CRIME FREE

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:43.545
HOUSING POLICIES. THAT

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:48.617
ENCOURAGE ADDICTION- AND

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:52.454
ANOTHER EXAMPLE- THIS IS THE

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.756
CITY OF HYSTERIA WHICH HAS-

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.691
FAST A NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.827
PROPERTY ORDINANCE IN TWO

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.262

THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITY WHAT AT

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:08.303
THE TIME THAT THIS WAS PASSED-

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:12.174
THAT- INDICATED A RACIALLY

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.675
DISCRIMINATORY MOTIVATION FOR

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:15.277
PASSING THE LOT IT WAS PASSED

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.611
IN RESPONSE TO A QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.547
DEMOGRAPHICALLY PROBLEM AND IT

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.748
THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT IT

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.316
WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY ENFORCED

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.851

IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE U.

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:28.156
S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SUED

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.457
THE CITY OF THIS AREA AS WELL

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.926

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:45.974
THE CALIFORNIA UNLAWFUL

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.343
DETAINER PILOT PROGRAM HAS.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.910
ALSO SHOWN TO BE-

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.212
DISPROPORTIONATELY ENFORCED

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:53.315

PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND LA TIMES

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.554
ANALYSIS- LOOKING AT RECORDS

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.090
FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:02.991
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO THAT

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.759
NEARLY 80% OF THE TENANTS

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.428
TARGETED PROTECTION UNDER THIS

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:08.330
PROGRAM WHERE BLACK LOT NEXT

ANOTHER TENANTS OF COLOR. I

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:13.535
NEED- BUT TENANTS BASED

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.904
EVICTION CASE OF EXACT TWICE

THEY'RE SURE THE CITY'S OUR POP-

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:21.643
CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN SOME

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.678
IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS IN TRYING

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.780
TO MITIGATE THAT TIME DOING.

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.148
IMPACTS OF NUISANCE AND CRIME

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.317
FREE ORDINANCES PROGRAMS-

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:33.121
RECENTLY- THERE IS AT THE HEART

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:36.524
REGULATION THAT WAS PASSED OUT-

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:38.193

ON BROAD DEFINITIONS OF

NUISANCE ACTIVITIES- SO THIS IS

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.166
A GREAT FIRST STEP AND IN

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:48.069
ADDITION- CALIFORNIA AB TWENTY

OTHER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.623
HOWEVER MORE- PROTECTIONS ARE

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:11.192
NEEDED TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:13.028
I'M SURE SOME POTENTIAL POLICY

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.796
SOLUTIONS TERMINATING THE

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:16.698
UNLAWFUL DETAINER PILOT PROGRAM

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.366
OF COURSE THIS IS SLATED TO

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.568
SUNSET TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.003
IT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ADDED

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.272
AT THAT POINT. IF NOT BEFORE-

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:27.742

YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:13.922
ME TODAY. SO I WANT TO TALK A

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:16.224
BIT ABOUT WHY THESE RACIAL

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.561
DISPARITIES MATTER AND HOW THEY

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.029
MANIFEST THROUGHOUT THE

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:24.165
LIFECYCLE OF RENTAL HOUSING. SO

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.066
FIRST THERE'S BEEN AN

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:27.669
INCREASING AMOUNT OF STUDIES

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:30.305
THAT CONFIRM WHAT I THINK WE

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:34.909
ALL KNOW. INTRINSICALLY WHICH

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.611
IS THAT WHERE WE LIVE. MATTERS

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.412
FOR ALMOST EVERY PART OF OUR

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:40.348
LIFE. WHERE WE LIVE HAS

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:42.250
CONCRETE OUTCOMES EITHER

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.319
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ON OUR

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:45.653
MORTALITY RATES ARE MENTAL

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.122
HEALTH OUR ABILITY TO

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.491
ACCUMULATE WEALTH OUR ABILITY

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.593
TO PASS THAT WEALTH LONG

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:56.164
GENERATIONS. AND SO. IF YOU'RE

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.799
IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A LOT

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.969
OF OPPORTUNITY HAS OPEN SPACES

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:01.469
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BETTER

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.338
OUTCOMES AND CONVERSELY YOU'LL

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:05.540
HAVE MORE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IF

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.909
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.345
SO WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.379
TWO DIFFERENT CITIES THAT I'VE

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.915
WORKED IN ON SYSTEMIC ADVOCACY

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.884
ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WAS

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.985
WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.421
AREA OF OPPORTUNITY IT'S A CITY

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.689
THAT HAD BEEN. HAS HISTORICALLY

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:25.493
BEEN VERY EXCLUSIONARY- IS A

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.763
BIT WEALTHIER HAS GOOD SCHOOLS.

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.766
HAS HAS GOOD ACTORS TO JOBS

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.935
ANOTHER COMMUNITY ONE THAT IS

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.303
CONSIDERED A RACIALLY AND

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.038
ETHNICALLY CAUGHT CONCENTRATED

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:39.741
AREAS OF POVERTY. SO THE FOR

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.209
COMMUNITY EVEN CALLED AREA OF

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:44.045
OCT IS ONE WAY I WAS TO AND

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:47.115
WORK ON PREVENTING THE MASTERS.

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.818
OF RESIDENTS WHO HAD LIVED LONG

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:52.821
TERM IN MOTELS IN THE CITY. FOR

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.823
DECADES AS WE FOUND OUT THE

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.692
CITY HAD STIFLED THE PRODUCTION

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:01.262
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THERE'S

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:02.730
SOME PRETTY DISCRIMINATORY

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:06.634
MEANS- AND SO THE RESIDENTS WHO

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.803
WERE LOWER INCOME IN IN THAT

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.538
CITY MANY OF WHOM ARE LATINO

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:11.706
WERE LIVING LONG TERM BRING

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.742
THIS. AS I GOT TO KNOW A NUMBER

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:17.312
OF THESE RESIDENTS I BEGAN TO

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.714
FIND PATTERNS LIVING IN A MOTEL

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.082
IS NOT CHEAP. IT IS NOT

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.884
AFFORDABLE. IT IS OFTEN NOT

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.620
ACCESSIBLE. BUT THE REASON THAT

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.055
MANY WERE LIVING THERE IS

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:31.626
BECAUSE THE SAME. FORECLOSURE

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:33.728
CRISIS THE SAME SUBPRIME

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.530
LENDING THAT AFFECTS BLACK AND

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:36.331
BROWN COMMUNITIES

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.665
DISPROPORTIONATELY HAD

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:40.835
DESTROYED SO MANY OF THEIR

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.338
CREDIT HISTORIES. TO SUCH AN

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:44.939
EXTENT THAT THEY HAD NO CHOICE

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.608
BUT TO LIVE IN MOTELS BECAUSE

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.943
NO TRADITIONAL APARTMENT

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.645
COMPLEX WOULD ACCEPT WOULD

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:55.350
ACCEPT THEM AS RENTERS. OTHERS

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.185
HAVE CRIMINAL HISTORY. BECAUSE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:59.521
OF THE SAME MASS INCARCERATION

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:00.922
THAT HAS DEVASTATED BLACK AND

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.259
BROWN COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.827
AREAS TO SCREENING TENDENCIES

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.096
BASED ON CRIMINAL HISTORY ALSO

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:11.533
LEFT THEM WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.434
ONE MOTHER THAT I TALKED TO

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.435
WHEN I ASKED HER WHY DID SHE

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.404
LIVE IN THE CITY INSTEAD OF

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.873
MOVING. SHE SAID TO ME WELL MY

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.509
SON HAS AUTISM. THIS IS THE

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:23.545
ONLY PLACE THAT I CAN GET A

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.780
GOOD INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.249
PLAN FOR. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.652
REALLY STUCK WITH ME. WE COULD

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.086
WE HAVE CREATED THESE BARRIERS

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.688
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'VE

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:36.591
CREATED BARRIERS ALONG TENANTS

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.993
YOU SCREENING. WE'VE HELLO TAX

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.462
CONSIDER WHO ARE WE TRYING TO

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:44.499
HOW. AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES.

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:45.967
EXIST FOR FOLKS THAT WERE

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.302
PUSHING PEOPLE INTO A REALLY

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:51.105
PRECARIOUS SITUATION. WHERE

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.975
THEY DO SO POTENTIAL EVICTION.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:57.245
AND ENTERED AND UP INTO BEING

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.547
X. IN THE- BEFORE WE WERE ABLE

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:03.184
TO COME TO SOME SOLUTION.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.386
BECAUSE THESE BARRIERS MANIFEST

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:08.323
ALONG. THE PLANNING AND

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:09.657
PRODUCTION SIDE OF RENTAL

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:13.728
HOUSING DID MANIFESTED ACCESS.

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:14.495
EIGHT LEAVE YOUR A SITUATION

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:17.899
WHERE. LANDLORDS CAN HARASS YOU

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.001
WITH EACH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:24.439
ENOUGH- ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:25.807

COMMUNITY LEAD HAVE LOOKED.

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:54.095
LURING ITS PLANNING FOR THE RE

THING THAT YOU SEE. IS THAT IN

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:11.012
BOTH COMMUNITIES. THE PEOPLE

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.114
THE BY PRODUCT PEOPLE WHO HAD

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:17.151
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM DECIDING FOR

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.220
THEMSELVES WHERE THEY LIVE AND

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.155
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:24.559
ACCESS CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.960
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.763
pWE'RE ASSESSING THE RACIAL

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.399
IMPACT OF EVERY. HOUSING POLICY

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.134
THAT WERE MAKING MUCH LIKE FOR

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.902
EXAMPLE SEATTLE AND SOME OTHER

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:37.405
CITIES HAVE DONE WHERE RACIAL

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.173
IMPACT ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.275
I'M NOT ALSO WERE MAKING SURE

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:43.444
THAT WE DECISIONS ARE BEING

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.747
MADE FOR RENTAL HOUSING- THE

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.316
PRODUCTION ACCESS ANY POINT

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:50.318
THAT WE'RE CENTERING DECISION

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:52.920
MAKING ON THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:56.657
HAVE BEEN- HARMED BY THAT.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:30:01.796
DECISION MAKING. SO THAT WILL

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:03.164
LEAD TO A NON OF. I HAVE THAT

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.668
WE- ALTERNATE TO. USING REPORT

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.604
FOR SCREENING WE NEED STRONGER

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:12.306
TENANT HARASSMENT POLICIES WE

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:14.208
NEED TO FULLY FUND OUR

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:15.543
DEPARTMENT FAIR EMPLOYMENT

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:16.277
HOUSINGS AND FORSTMANN

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.746
ACTIVITIES WE NEED TO DO ALL OF

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:21.182
THESE THINGS. BUT I THINK AT

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.084
THE HEART OF IT IS THAT WE NEED

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:25.453
TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER NOT JUST

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.321
THAT WE'RE HOUSING PEOPLE. BUT

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.323
WHO ARE WE HOUSING BECAUSE NOT

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.025
EVERY TYPE OF HOUSING IS GOING

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.260
TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:34.796
PERSON AND EVERY FAMILY AND

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.631
THAT THAT WILL BE DESPERATE

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:39.867
BASED ON THE HARMS OF THIS RED

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:42.370
LINING AND GOVERNMENT FEDERAL

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:46.073
LOCAL- GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.810
THE HARMS FROM A REAL ESTATE.

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.011
AGENCIES IN THE WHOLE PERSON

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:55.449
WHITE. MOVE THROUGH CONTRA OR

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:59.720
EXCLUDE. IS K. FROM OPERA TO

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:02.323
PROTECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.391
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.459
PRESENT AND I DO TO OPEN IT TO

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.662
THE COME MEMBERS. FOR QUESTIONS

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.730
HOWEVER RIGHT BEFORE WE GO TO

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:13.701
I- I WANT TO. BRING SOMETHING

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.203
UP LET ME GROW ALL YOU YOU

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:17.872
MENTIONED CREDIT. AND- WE NEED

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:20.107
TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:23.211
EVALUATING A PERSON OTHER THAN

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:26.781
JUST CREDIT HOWEVER IF- AND

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:27.915
CREDIT SCORES YOU KNOW RIGHT

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.350
NOW ARE BEING USED AND IF THEY

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:31.986
REMAIN THE MAIN MECHANISM TO

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:34.055
DETERMINE SOMEONE'S ACCESS TO

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.057
HIGH QUALITY HOUSING. WHAT ELSE

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:42.997
CAN WE DO. TO HELP PEOPLE BUILD

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:46.601
THEIR CREDIT. THAT'S A GREAT

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.669
QUESTION I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:49.937
FOR MANY OF THE CLIENTS THAT I

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:52.240
WORK WITH THERE'S REALLY VERY

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:54.275
LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.711
CRACK. SO SOME OF THE REASONS

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.279
CAN INCLUDE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.882
INSTITUTIONALIZED WHETHER JAILS

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.350
PRISONS ARE PSYCHIATRIC

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.852
HOSPITALS THEIR RECENT

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:07.655
IMMIGRANTS- OR AS I MENTIONED

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.490
THAT THE YOU KNOW THIRD THEY

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:11.225
THEY BEEN THE VICTIMS OF SUB.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:17.231
LENDING AND SO I DID LISTEN TO

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.099
SOME OF THE EARLY PANEL TERMS

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:19.867
OF BUILDING FINANCE ASSETS BUT

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.535
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.137
WE'VE HAD TO DO FOR NUMBER OF

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.072
THE PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH.

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.909
IS ADVOCATES STRENUOUSLY LOOK

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.744
AT BANK STATEMENTS LOOK AT

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.246
RENTAL HISTORY MANY PEOPLE PAY

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.381
THE RENT BEFORE THEY'LL PAY

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.616
ANYTHING ELSE. LOOK AT THESE

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:36.517
THINGS ARE OLD FEDERAL

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.219
TORNADOES BECAUSE IF WE DO

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.721
CONTINUE TO RELY ON CREDIT.

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:41.522
WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:44.091
EXCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE I

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:45.493
THINK IN PERPETUITY BECAUSE

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:46.994
THEY DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.996
TO BUILD CREDIT. I APPRECIATE

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.032
THAT WELL WONDER THE THING

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:53.200
BEFORE OF AGAIN WE GO WE GO TO

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.069
THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS.

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:56.070
AND THIS IS FOR ALL PANELIST

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:57.505
AYE I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.639
INCREASING THE AFFORDABLE

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:01.108
HOUSING SUPPLY HAS TO BE A PART

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.010
OF THE CONVERSATION. AND

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.178
ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.714
STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY- REPORT

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.749
CAME OUT THAT STATED THE STATE

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:11.352
LACKS A SOUND WELL COORDINATED

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.954
STRATEGY TO MOST AFFECTED

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.789
AFFECTIVELY USE ITS FINANCIAL

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.691
RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.492
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I'M

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.294
CONCERNED THAT OUR EFFORTS TO

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.797
PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:25.232
HOMEOWNERSHIP MAY SUFFER FROM

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.902
THE SAME DFICIENCIES SO. HOW

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.737
HAVE THE STATE'S PROGRAMS TO

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.305
PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:33.641
INCORPORATED RACIAL EQUITY INTO

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:34.608
THEIR PLANNING A PROGRAM

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:37.211
EXECUTION AND HOW SUCCESSFUL

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.447
HAVE THEY BEEN I GUESS FURTHER

01:33:39.513 --> 01:33:41.415
I CAN SAY. IS THE SUFFICIENT

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.451
COORDINATION AMONG THE STATES

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:45.086
SEVERAL HOUSING FINANCE-

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.721
FINANCING ENTITIES TO

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:52.727
EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THIS. POLICY

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:55.229
AND POLICY CHANGE. M. ANY ANY

01:33:55.296 --> 01:34:03.804
OF THE PANELISTS CAN RESPOND.

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:11.679
BUT NOT ALL AT ONCE. I THINK

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.748
THAT- I'LL BE THE BRAVE ONE AND

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:14.782
SAY THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:16.183
BECAUSE LARGELY WE DON'T

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:21.122
ACCOUNT FOR- RACE IN IN THESE

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:21.689
ALREADY AND I THINK THAT IT

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:24.492
ACCOUNTS IT REQUIRES US TO

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:27.895
RETHINK- ABOUT HOW WE ARE

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:30.631
LOOKING AT THIS- AND SEE IF

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:33.801
THEY'RE WAYS TO LOOK AT GROUPS-

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.970
BASED ON YOU KNOW THE

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:38.239
GENERATIONAL HISTORY OF. LACK

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:42.343
OF ACCESS TO- ISSUES LACK OF

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.612
ACCESS TO- EQUITY AND

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:46.213
PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.250
HOMEOWNERSHIP PROCESS- SO I

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.685
THINK THAT HONESTLY IT'S MORE

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:53.854
ABOUT A REFORMATION OF HOW WE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.556
THINK M. AND LOOK AT THESE

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:58.826
POLICIES THAT'S WHY I THINK. WE

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.461
MIGHT BE. I KIND OF SILENCE ON

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.798
THIS IS. IT'S A REBUILD PROGRAM

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.700
OF SORTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:11.338
RESPONSE AND. WITH THAT I WOULD

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.975
LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO. SHARE

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.143
TO THAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.578
SO I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS FOR

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:20.214
THE PANELISTS SO- ALL OF US

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.583
KNOW THAT OUR VISION RATES

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:25.686
HAVE. REALLY REFLECTED THE

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:26.687
INEQUITIES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:35:26.754 --> 01:35:29.190
RACE- WONDERING WHAT

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:29.924
SUGGESTIONS YOU WOULD HAVE TO

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:34.261
US. AND HOW DO WE- BOTH DO A

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.362
BETTER JOB OF TRACKING THESE OF

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:37.731
ACTION RATES- SHOWCASING THE

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:39.767
INEQUITIES AND WHAT MORE CAN WE

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.769
DO THAT ONCE WE HAVE THIS

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:45.306
INFORMATION- TO CHANGE

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.707
DIFFERENT AREAS OF LAW THAT YOU

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:47.975
THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE. AND

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.743
THAT RELATED TO THAT WANTED TO

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:51.212
ASK WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.480
PROCESS FOR REPORTING FAIR

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.682
HOUSING COMPLAINTS AT THIS

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:56.350
MOMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL- WHAT

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:57.818
FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATIONS LOOK

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.720
LIKE IF THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO

APOLOGIZE ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY ON

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.230
THIS WE- AT THEIR DISPLACEMENT

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.431
PROJECT OR THE PROCESS OF

01:36:10.498 --> 01:36:11.532
COLLECTING AS MUCH OF ACTION

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.134
DATA AS POSSIBLE USING MORE

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.568
ADVANCED DATA SCIENCE TOOLS

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:16.370
SUCH AS MINING AND SCRAPING

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:19.406
COURT RECORDS- AND WORKING WITH

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:20.808
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.576
AT RED. RIVER RESTITUTION THIS

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:26.647
AS WELL AS- OBTAINING NOTICES-

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.482
AND SO IT'S HARD YOU KNOW IT'S

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:29.383
HARD TO GET AT THE STATE OF

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.651
BECAUSE IT'S HIDDEN AND MOST

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:32.119
NATIONAL EFFORTS TO COLLECT

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:34.221
THIS DATA HAVE. FALLEN SHORT ON

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.923
THE WEST COAST AND SO WE'RE

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.892
TRYING TO SUPPLEMENT THAT- I

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.126
THINK SOME OF THE EFFORTS IN

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:40.394
SAN FRANCISCO PARTICULARLY A

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.596
RENTAL REGISTRY THAT HELPS-

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:45.166
IDENTIFY. SEVERAL THINGS THAT

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.133
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.868
UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS ONE

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:50.938
HOW MUCH- A RENTAL UNIT COSTS-

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.573
IT WAS THEIR VACANCY WATER THE

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.941
PROCESS SEES AND ALSO THE

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.910
REPORTING STRATEGIES. WHEN IT

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:57.311
COMES TO THE BIG FAN OR

01:36:57.378 --> 01:36:58.979
COMPLAINT. THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.481
KIND OF A BETTER COLLECTION

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:01.815
SERVICE BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:05.786
GOING TO REQUIRE. USING SOME-

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:10.524
AT. BUT IT'S GOING REQUIRES TO.

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:11.659
NOT REALLY NO WHAT THE STATE OF

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:13.127
ADDICTION WILL BE FOR WHILE

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:14.962
UNTIL THIS IS COLLECTED OR

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.830
REQUIRED ADVANCED TOOLS AND

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:19.099
EXPENSIVE- PROJECTS TO TRY AND

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.167
COLLECT SOME SORT OF

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:20.834
UNDERSTANDING OR AT LEAST GET A

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:23.103
SIGNAL WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:23.637
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:25.539
ISSUES RIGHT NOW IS WE JUST

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:28.108
DON'T KNOW HOW BAD. THE THE

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.411
HOLE IN THE SHIP IS- IN

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:33.380
PARTICULAR- BUT WE WITH LITTLE

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:37.151
DATA WE CAN MAKE BIG PROGRESS

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:44.792
IN AND- C. BIG CHANGES. SPACES

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.360
BORN JUST MENTIONED- A COUPLE

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:50.297
YEARS AGO I HI READ- TRULY

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:52.566
OUTSTANDING WORK- BY MATTHEW

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:55.269
DESMOND- THE HIS FAMOUS EVICTED

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:58.239
POVERTY AND PROFIT- AND- HIS

01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:00.274
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. IN

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:01.976
MILWAUKEE AND IN THAT PART OF

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.777
THE COUNTRY REALLY OPENED MY

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:04.912
EYES UP TO WHAT MORE WE COULD

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:07.248
ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT AS YOU WELL

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:07.815
KNOW AS I'VE DISCUSSED WITH

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:10.284
HIM- TO YOUR POINT WE JUST

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:12.620
DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND- VERY

01:38:12.686 --> 01:38:14.922
MUCH WOULD BE OPEN TO IDEAS AND

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:15.522
HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.091
UNDERSTANDING THE DATA BECAUSE-

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.892
I THINK ONCE WE HAVE THE DATA.

01:38:18.959 --> 01:38:21.862
IT WILL- REALLY DRIVE THE CASE

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.497
FOR WHY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:24.665
THINGS DIFFERENTLY SO-

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:25.666

CALIFORNIA TO LEAD ON THIS

01:38:57.731 --> 01:39:00.000

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.469
NATURE OF HOMELESSNESS WITH OUR

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:17.271
HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE I THINK

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:21.241
IT CONTINUES TO BE- CRITICAL TO

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:22.643
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GROUPS OF

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.111
HOMELESSNESS IS REALLY ABOUT

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:25.479
SAID JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.414
ALL HOME WE ARE A BAY AREA

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.383
ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.018
REGIONAL SOLUTIONS THAT DISRUPT

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:33.053
HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:45.165
TODAY- WE THINK ALSO THAT THAT

THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:54.975
EXIST WITHIN THE HOMELESSNESS

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.910
POPULATION IT'S CRITICAL TO

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:59.480
ALSO EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC-

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.515
IMMOBILITY THAT EXISTS FOR MANY

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.383
EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:07.855
IN IN- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:08.622
AS WELL AS IN THE BAY AREA. SO

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:09.857
I WANTED TO JUST WALK US

THROUGH A LITTLE BIT NAY AND

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:12.359
MUCH OF MY PRESENTATION IS

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:13.427
GOING TO BE ON THE BAY AREA

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:15.062
CONTACTS BUT JUST TO REALLY

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:18.165
ILLUSTRATE HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:20.868
CHALLENGES- BLACK CALIFORNIANS

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.569
MANY WE ALREADY KNOW THIS THIS

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:26.573
DATA IS VERY EXPLICIT- AROUND

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.075
THE DISPROPORTIONAL IDEA OF HOW

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:31.278
MANY- BACKGROUND IN INDIGENOUS

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.513
FOLKS IN THE GENERAL

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:35.215
POPULATION- IN THEIR OVER

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:36.483
REPRESENTATION IN THE

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:39.319
HOMELESSNESS POPULATION. AND I

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:40.787
WANTED TO LEAD WITH TALKING

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:41.822
ABOUT SORT OF THE STRUCTURAL

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:44.358
DRIVERS AROUND WHY THIS THESE

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.593
DISPARITIES EXIST- I'M AND I'M

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.495
BALLIN BLIND THEM HERE THERE

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:49.763
ARE MANY OTHERS BUT FROM MY

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:50.631
PERSPECTIVE THESE SORT OF

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:52.299
REPRESENT HOW WE GOT HERE IN

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:53.734
THE FIRST PLACE IN THE

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.168
CONDITIONS THAT PERPETUATE

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:56.603
HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.472
ACROSS THE STATE. INCOME

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.374
INEQUALITY AND LACK OF INCOME

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.444
ECONOMIC MOBILITY IS PERVASIVE

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:05.712
AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:06.780
TREND THROUGHOUT THE

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.449
PRESENTATIONS THIS AFTERNOON-

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:12.085
ESPECIALLY THE HISTORIC CONTEXT

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:13.987
OF STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT HAS.

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:14.888
REALLY SORT OF CREATED THE

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:16.623
CONTAINER IN WHICH-

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.493
HOMELESSNESS EXISTS- OUR RACIAL

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.361
WEALTH GAP THE LACK OF

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:22.930
AFFORDABLE HOUSING VERY

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.798
EXPLICIT ANTI BLACK HOUSING

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:27.868
POLICIES WHICH MUCH OF OUR-

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:30.504
SOCIETY HAS BEEN CREATED ON I

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.405
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:34.041
THAT UP AS WELL AS THE OVER

01:43:34.107 --> 01:43:35.976
EXPOSURE TO THE CHILD WELFARE

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.678
AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:40.480
THESE STRUCTURAL DRIVERS. ARE

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:43.250
THE REASONS WHY YOU SEE SUCH A

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:45.352
DESPERATE IMPACT ON THE BY PARK

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.553
COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.021
HOMELESSNESS AND IT SORT OF

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:50.457
OUTLINED- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:52.459
SLIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:54.061
COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY TAKING

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:57.164
THIS ON AND ON AND CONFRONTING

01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:02.069
THESE DISPARITIES BECAUSE IF.

01:44:02.135 --> 01:44:02.803
WE DON'T TAKE IT ON HEAD ON.

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:06.173
DOUBLE ON. AND TORE THOSE TO.

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:08.108
IN OUR PROGRAMS HOMELESSNESS

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:10.010
SYSTEMS AND OUTCOMES THAT WERE

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:11.812
ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO REVERSE

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:14.281
THEM AND I WANTED TO JUST

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:16.149
HIGHLIGHT WHAT CONTRA COSTA IS

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:17.784
DOING IN TERMS OF ITS RACIAL

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.786
EQUITY ASSESSMENT RELATIVE TO

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:20.988
HOMELESSNESS. AND BY

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:24.057
DISAGGREGATED DATA BY RACE THEY

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:26.159
ARE ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:28.595
WHO'S ACCESSING WHAT SERVICES

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.364
ARE THE SERVICES THAT

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:33.133
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND HOW

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.534
DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:35.869
TARGETING THE APPROPRIATE

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:38.905
RESOURCES TO THE APPROPRIATE

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:42.609
PEOPLE. THIS SLIDE- JUST KIND

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:45.545
OF BRINGS HOME- VERY CLEARLY

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:46.680
AND OF COURSE THIS IS PRE

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:50.050
PANDEMIC DATA SO- WANTING TO

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.518
REFLECT HERE JUST THE

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:52.719
SIGNIFICANT DISPROPORTIONATE

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:56.423
ALITY IN- BLACK AND INDIGENOUS

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:58.892
HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR. FIVE

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:01.495
PERCENT- AT MORE THAN FIVE

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:05.565
TIMES- THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:08.001
OF BLACK AMERICANS IN THE BAY

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:10.871
AREA- ARE REPRESENTED IN THE

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:12.739
HOMELESS POPULATION AND TWELVE

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:15.709
TIMES IN THE INDIGENOUS

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.444
POPULATION SO AGAIN. DATA IS

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.046
IMPORTANT BUT THE TO SHOULD BE

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.981
A CATALYST FOR FIGURING OUT

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:22.349
WHAT IMPACT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:23.750
IT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:27.454
LOT OF OUR CONVERSATION. TODAY

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:29.322
I WANTED TO ALSO JUST ED

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:32.526
ILLUSTRATES- THE WEALTH GAP.

01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:34.327
RIGHT ME WE OFTEN HEAR THESE

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.930
STATISTICS WE SEE THE SLIDES

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:38.899
BUT THIS IS PERVASIVE THIS GOES

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:42.269
BACK FROM. NINETEEN NINEY TWO

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:42.903
TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE KNOW

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:44.004
THESE TREND LINES ARE PRETTY

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:47.441
CONSISTENT. WITH HOW EVEN WITH

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.509
MORE AWARENESS AROUND RACIAL

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.144
EQUITY IN UNDERSTANDING THE

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:53.447
COMPLEXITY OF WHAT'S GOING ON

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.148
FOR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:57.984
THESE TREND LINES PROCESS SO I

01:45:58.051 --> 01:46:00.320
THINK THAT IT'S- IT'S REALLY

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:02.923
IMPORTANT. TO NOT ONLY.

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:05.358
UNDERSTAND THE DATA BUT THEN

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:08.495
TAKE ACTION AROUND TRYING TO

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:10.764
CHIP THOSE TREND LINES. AND

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:13.300
THEN YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO THE

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:14.601
ASSET BUILDING I KNOWINGLY

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:16.670
EARLIER ON PANELS YOU TALKED

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:19.706
ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP AND RENTAL

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:22.008
HOUSING YOU KNOW THIS REALLY

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:24.945
DEMONSTRATES HOW THE STIGMA

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:27.481
THAT EXISTS AROUND SUBSIDIZED

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:29.683
HOUSING AND REFLECTING THAT IN

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.818
FACT OUR HIGHER INCOME

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:33.420
HOUSEHOLDS ON THE ECONOMIC

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:34.988
SPECTRUM. AND PREDOMINANTLY

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:37.157
WHITE HOUSEHOLDS ACTUALLY

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:39.059
RECEIVE A PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.894
TAX SUBSIDY UP FOR THEIR

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:43.196
HOUSING BUT WE HAVE A MUCH

01:46:43.263 --> 01:46:45.665
HARDER TIME FIGURING OUT

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:47.567
SUBSIDIZED SOLUTIONS FOR PEOPLE

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:49.803
ALONG THE LOWER ECONOMIC

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:51.238
ECONOMIC SPECTRUM AND SO I

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:54.674
WANTED TO JUST ILLUSTRATE HERE

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:56.843
THAT- TAX SUBSIDIES ARE BUILT

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:59.346
INTO HOW IN FACT PEOPLE-

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:00.981
ACQUIRE WEALTH IN A CHOIR

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.849
HOUSING AND WE NEED TO. HAVE

01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:04.885
EQUITY AROUND THOSE THOSE

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:08.121
SUBSIDIES- IN ORDER TO ADDRESS

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:11.358
THE DISPARITIES THAT EXCESS.

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:12.526
AND THEN THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:14.661
REFLECTION WE'VE ALSO JUST JUST

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:17.898
CONCLUDED THE RENOWNED- COUNTS

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:19.933
THIS IS JUST AN ILLUSTRATION OF

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.170
THE DEARTH- HOUSING FOR PEOPLE

01:47:23.236 --> 01:47:25.472
WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES IN

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.407
THE BAY AREA IN IN THE STATE OF

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.276
CALIFORNIA AND WHERE WE ARE

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:31.311
PUTTING OUR EMPHASIS ON OUR

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.413
DEVELOPMENT PIPELINES. WE SEE

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.682
HERE THAN ABOVE MODERATE.

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:40.453
pPRODUCED DISPROPORTIONATELY TO

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.155
WHERE WE NEED IT THE MOST WHICH

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:43.523
IS THE LOWER END OF THE

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:48.161
ECONOMIC A SPECTRUM AND AGAIN.

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:49.596
CONSISTENT WITH THE TREND LINES

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.665
THAT WE'RE SEEING BASED ON THE

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:53.733
SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING-

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.668
THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:57.170
CALIFORNIA FOR OUR FORMALLY

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:59.706
HOMELESS AND- AN EXTREMELY LOW

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:02.776
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND I ALSO

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:04.845
WOULD SAY. WE HAVE HAD A PRETTY

01:48:04.911 --> 01:48:08.114
SIGNIFICANT PARADIGM AROUND THE

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:10.050
ONLY HOUSING WE THINK ABOUT FOR

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.351
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:12.953
HOMELESSNESS IS PERMANENT

01:48:13.019 --> 01:48:14.955
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ONE OF

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:16.189
THE THINGS THAT ALL HOME IS

01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:18.458
REALLY TRYING TO DO IS SHIFT

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.493
THAT NARRATIVE TO UNDERSTAND

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.230
THAT NOT EVERYONE NEEDS. DEEPLY

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:25.565
NEEDS SUPPORTED HOUSING A LOT

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.634
OF FOLKS JUST NEED DEEPLY

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.969
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THEIR

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:31.271
INCOMES CAN COVER AND SO YOU

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.473
MAY HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED SOME

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.041
SERVICES BUT THEY DON'T NEED

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.910
ONGOING COMPREHENSIVE PERMANENT

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:38.812
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. SO WE THINK

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:39.980
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK

01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:42.015
AT THE CONTINUUM OF NEED AND

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:43.516
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSING

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:45.552
OPTIONS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.387
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:52.325
SERVICES- THIS THIS LINE IS

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:55.395
JUST A REFLECTION I THINK OF I

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:57.130
THINK IT WAS ME MERIEL OR THE

01:48:57.197 --> 01:49:00.467
PREVIOUS SPEAKER REALLY-

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.068
TALKING ABOUT LISTENING TO

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.504

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:07.240
CRISIS AND BEING VERY COMPLAIN

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.743
ABOUT HOW WE TRY TO SOLVE THE

01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:11.411
PROBLEM DOESN'T NEED TO BE THIS

01:49:11.478 --> 01:49:13.079
COMPLEX BUREAUCRACY THAT WE

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:15.515
CREATED IT ACTUALLY CAN BE VERY

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.083
SIMPLE IF WERE LISTENING AND

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:18.818

ORGANIZATIONS HOW WE NEED TO

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:34.935
REALLY LISTEN AND INTERPRET NOT

NOT USE OUR OWN INTERPRETATION

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:37.938
BUT REALLY HEAR WHAT PEOPLE

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:39.673
NEED AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.408
CREATE POLICIES TO DELIVER ON

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:43.376
THOSE SPEEDS AND THIS IS JUST A

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:44.945
COUPLE OF AB REFLECTIONS

DIRECTLY FROM- THE SOME FOLKS

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.949
THAT WE'VE INTERVIEWED DURING

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:49.849
THE CALL THE CRISIS IN

WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:04.331
EFFORTS HAPPENING ACROSS THE

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:07.167
BAY AREA DESTINATION HOME- DID

KEY STRATEGIES TO ENSURE. THAT

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.711
BEARER ADDRESSING THE RACIAL

READ MORE ENSURE STRATEGIES. SO

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.073
THE LAST TWO SLIDES HERE MY

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.274
PRESENTATION OR JUST SORT OF

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:22.876
WHAT I THINK WE CAN DO ABOUT IT

01:51:22.942 --> 01:51:24.411
RIGHT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:26.679
MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS AS I SAID

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:27.847
WITH LIVED EXPERTISE AND

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.349
EXPERIENCE ARE NOT JUST AT THE

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:30.950
TABLE TO HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.052
FOR THEM. BUT THAT THERE ARE

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.686
PART OF THE PROGRAMMING THEY'RE

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:35.388
PART OF THE POLICY MAKING THE

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:37.357
FUNDING DECISIONS RIGHT HOW DO

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:39.225
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.194
ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE GOING

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:42.862
DIRECTLY TO THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:44.664
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. WHEN YOU

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:45.865
DON'T FOCUS ON SOMETHING IT

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:48.068
DOESN'T GET DONE. APPLYING A

01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:50.437
RACIAL IN EQUITY LENS ALWAYS

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:53.039
REALLY MEANS. NOT JUST DOING IT

01:51:53.106 --> 01:51:54.340
AT THE FRONT END OF YOUR SYSTEM

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.209
BUT REALLY TESTING OUT ITS

01:51:56.276 --> 01:51:57.944
IMPLEMENTATION WHETHER OR NOT

01:51:58.011 --> 01:51:59.813
YOU WERE SEEN THE DISPARITIES

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:02.949
THAT THAT PROCESS- NUMBER THREE

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:03.883
I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:06.519
IMPORTANT AND SPEAKS TO. ONE OF

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.420
THE QUESTIONS THAT THE

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:09.656
COMMITTEE MEMBER ASKED EARLIER

01:52:09.722 --> 01:52:12.459
ABOUT CREDIT. WHEN WE TALK

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:14.894
ABOUT STRUCTURAL RACISM MUCH OF

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.863
HOW OUR HOUSING POLICIES WERE

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:19.432
DESIGNED ARE REALLY IN THAT IT

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:21.134
IS IN STRUCTURAL RACISM AND

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:23.770
EXCLUSION. OF OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.605
PEOPLE BLACK BROWN AND

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:27.307
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:29.008
SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND

01:52:29.075 --> 01:52:30.410
TEST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:32.412
STRUCTURAL RACISM THROUGHOUT

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:34.948
EVERY INTERVENTION THAT WE HAVE

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.816
AND SO I THINK THAT KIND OF

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:39.819
BROWN'S ARE WORKING I REALLY- I

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:41.287
THINK IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.755
UNDERSTAND SORT OF HOW.

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.791
STRUCTURAL RACISM SHOWS UP IN

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:46.493
SPECIFIC POLICIES AND I THINK

01:52:46.559 --> 01:52:48.928
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:49.562
CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:51.464
AROUND THAT. LAST POINT HERE IS

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.333
JUST AS I SAID HOUSING SECURITY

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:55.101
AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ARE

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:57.804
REALLY- CONNECTED AND WE NEED

01:52:57.871 --> 01:53:01.141
TO BE DOING INTERRELATED POLICY

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:04.043
WORK IN ADVOCACY TO ENSURE THAT

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.079
WE ARE. NOT ONLY THINKING ABOUT

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:07.614
OUR SUPPLY A PRESERVATION AND

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.415
PROTECTION OF TENANTS AND

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:11.284
HOUSING BUT WE'RE ALSO THINKING

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:12.552
ABOUT HOW DO WE INCREASE

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:15.221
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES TO ENSURE

01:53:15.288 --> 01:53:18.725
THAT PEOPLE. ARE ABLE TO STAY

01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:19.292
IN THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRST

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:22.128
PLACE. AND THEN THIS IS MY

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:24.330
FINAL SLIDE JUST LIFTING UP TO

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:27.167
ME YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A CHOICE

01:53:27.233 --> 01:53:28.368
THAT'S WHY I'M SO HONORED TO BE

01:53:28.434 --> 01:53:30.236
HERE WITH YOU TODAY IF WE'RE

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.538
REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOUSING

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:32.438
JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.073
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.075
TALKING ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:38.878
THE HISTORIC- DISCRIMINATORY

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:41.047
PRACTICES PROCESS IT'S A FACT

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:43.449
WE HAVE IMPERIAL EMPIRICAL DATA

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:44.884
TO SUPPORT THAT AND I THINK

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.753
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:47.854
KEEP THAT AT THE FOREFRONT OF

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:49.088
OUR MINDS AS WE TRY TO TACKLE

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.157
THIS CHALLENGE. THE LAST THING

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:52.192
I WOULD SAY BEFORE I TURN IT

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:54.861
OVER- BACK OVER TO THE

01:53:54.928 --> 01:53:57.230
COMMITTEE IS ALL HOME IS REALLY

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:59.933
FOCUSING ON THE FULL SPECTRUM

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:02.168
OF INTERVENTIONS THAT RELATE TO

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:03.436
HOMELESSNESS SO FROM OUR

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:05.171
PERSPECTIVE IT REALLY REQUIRES

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:07.574
AN INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION HOW

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.442
DO WE MAKE SURE THAT HOUSEHOLDS

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:10.910
DON'T BECOME HOMELESS IN THE

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.912
FIRST PLACE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.781
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:16.115
RENTAL ASSISTANCE LEGAL

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:18.785
SERVICES AND SO FORTH TO KEEP

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.420
THEM HOUSED IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:54:20.486 --> 01:54:22.322
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

01:54:22.388 --> 01:54:24.557
RECOGNIZING THAT THE BROTHERS

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:25.825
AND SISTERS WHO ARE ON THE

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.994
STREET TODAY NEED TO BE BROUGHT

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:30.096
INDOORS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:31.998
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR US TO

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:33.466
ALLOW OUR NEIGHBORS TO LANGUISH

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.134
ON THE STREET. WHILE WE BUILD

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:37.136
ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE SO

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:38.104
WE THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:39.872
IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE

01:54:39.939 --> 01:54:41.407
NUMBER OF INTERIM HOUSING

01:54:41.474 --> 01:54:42.909
OPTIONS AND THAT COULD BE

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:46.045
ANYTHING FROM A SUBSIDY TO- NON

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.847
CONGREGATE SHELTER WHATEVER WE

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:49.749
NEED TO DO TO KEEP PEOPLE

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.985
INSIDE AND SAFE SO THAT WE CAN

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.053
SIMULTANEOUSLY BE LOOKING FOR

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.955
PERMANENT HOUSING EXITS WHICH

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:57.991
IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL WE BELIEVE

01:54:58.057 --> 01:54:59.459
THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA

01:54:59.525 --> 01:55:00.827
EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.929
DESERVES A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.764
PLACE TO LIVE AND WE THINK IF

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.699
WE ARE DOING ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:08.635

INVESTMENTS IN THOSE SYSTEMS

01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:15.842
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:17.810

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:34.807
OF THE- HE STRATEGIES IS MAKING

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:36.709
SURE THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO

02:03:36.776 --> 02:03:39.478
STANDARDIZE OUR DATA. PRACTICES

02:03:39.545 --> 02:03:42.414
AND HELPING TO INCENTIVIZE

DATA BY RACE AND ETHNICITY- AND

02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:50.389
HAVING THAT LEADERSHIP FROM THE

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:52.725
STATE TO INCENTIVIZE THAT TYPE

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.026
OF DATA COLLECTION I THINK

02:03:54.093 --> 02:03:54.960
WOULD BE REALLY REALLY

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:58.664
IMPORTANT- BECAUSE HE YOU KNOW.

02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:00.966
WE ALSO CAN USE GEOGRAPHIC

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:03.335
TARGETING- WHERE THERE IS IT

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:04.804
THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE-

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:07.840
GRANT BURDEN- THE AND I THINK.

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:09.608
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO YOU TALKED

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:12.311
EARLIER ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS PAYING

3250% OF THEIR INCOME TO RENT

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.714
MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:17.550
PARTICULARLY- WHO ARE

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.351
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ARE

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.754
PAYING EIGHTY TO A 100% OF

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:23.422
THEIR INCOME TO RENT AND SO I

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:26.225
THINK WE CAN. REALLY FOCUS ON

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:29.962
METRICS THAT. ALIGN WITH WHERE

02:04:30.029 --> 02:04:32.531
THE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING-

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.033
THERE HOUSING CRISIS FOCUSING

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:36.802
ON THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND- AND

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:39.572
CENSUS TRACTS AS WELL AS-

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.273
HAVING A STANDARDIZED DATA

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.474
COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:45.010
LOCALITIES BUYING INTO THAT THE

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:47.479
STATE SUPPORTS THAT INCLUDES

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:51.450
INCOME- BRAZEN ETHNICITY DATA

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:53.185
SO THAT WE CAN THEN THE-

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:56.355
PROPORTION OUR RESOURCES TOWARD

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.257
REDUCING THOSE DISPARITIES. AND

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.125
THEN THE OTHER THING I'D SAY

02:05:00.192 --> 02:05:03.996
IS- THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:05.931
TYPICALLY USE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:07.266
EXPERIENCING HOMELESS

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:10.369
HOMELESSNESS BEARING BYE. BY

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:13.138
ETHNICITY- AS AS AS

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:15.241
COMMUNICATED BY MY COLLEAGUES

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:17.977
AND SO. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.945
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:22.514
HOW DO WE LOOK AT-

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:25.818
INCENTIVIZING SHALLOW SUBSIDIES

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.319
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE RENTAL

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:30.456
ASSISTANCE I THINK THE- HOUSE

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.725
OF HOMELESSNESS- SYSTEM IS

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:33.893
REALLY FOCUSED ON CREDIT

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:36.462
SITTING. AND THE LONGER PEOPLE

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:38.530
END UP BEING EXPOSED TO

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:40.232
HOMELESSNESS THE MORE SUPPORT

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:41.867
THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUT IF WE

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:43.903
CAN GO A BIT UPSTREAM AND

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:45.871
INSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEEK

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:48.207
HELP. THEY CAN GET THAT HELP

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:49.975
SOMETIMES IT'S AS LITTLE AS

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:51.343
THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:52.878
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:54.079
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE BECOMES

02:05:54.146 --> 02:05:56.282
HOMELESS OR NOT AND SO REALLY

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:57.716
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:59.318
DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES THAT

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:02.488
PROVIDE. ACCESS TO LOWER

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:06.792
SERVICE. NEEDS IN ADDITION TO

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.294
AGAIN BUILDING OUT AS MUCH

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.929
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WE CAN IN

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:11.697
PROVIDING PERMANENT HOMES FOR

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:12.631
PEOPLE WITH EXTREMELY LOW

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:16.502
INCOMES. I THINK MIGHT BE PART

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:17.403
OF THE SOLUTION. SO WHAT I'M

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:18.971
GOING TO JUST READ. WHAT MY

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:22.541
COLLEAGUE ON THIS LAW SAYS SAID

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:24.777
PIPE. BOMB ONE OF THE IT IS

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.011
BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:28.180
DISAGGREGATE DATA BY BRITAIN'S

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:30.616
F. THIRTY WE DO NEED TO SEE

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:32.618
THAT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:34.620
STATE WE DO THAT

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:37.089
DISAGGREGATION. A WITHIN LOS

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.924
ANGELES COUNTY AND WE DO RELY

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:40.693
ON THE H. MY HAS SYSTEM WHICH

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:43.195
DOES PROVIDE THIS APPLICATION

02:06:43.262 --> 02:06:48.300
SO THAT'S ONE. POINT. THAT I

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:48.867
WILL PUT IT RIGHT. SO POINT

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:50.402
THAT I WILL TO READ. THAT COMES

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:52.871
THROUGH OUR FINDINGS AND WAS

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:55.007
SPOKEN TO BY A SMALL SWITCH IS

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:57.343
TRULY INCLUDE THE VOICES OF

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:59.812
PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:02.147
DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:04.216
THERE WAS A WAY. TO INCENTIVIZE

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.417
SOME OF THAT IN THE DATA

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.853
COLLECTION PROCESS THAT WOULD

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.989
BE GOOD AND THE THIRD PIECE IS

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:12.691
REALLY UNDERSTANDING. THAT

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:15.327
THERE REALLY IS VERY XIN AMONG

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.996
PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE

02:07:17.062 --> 02:07:18.664
WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS AND

02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:21.033
ATTENTION TO BOTH. I DO THINK

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.469
UPSTREAM PREVENTIVE PEACE IS

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.904
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SINCE WE

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:27.773
HEARD IN OUR SMALL STUDY WITH.

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.608
OUR SMALL SAMPLE OF

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:32.211
PARTICIPANTS EVERYONE DOES NOT

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:34.380
SEE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

RESOURCES AND WE DO THIS IN A

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:36.341
WAY- THAT- THAT THAT ALLEVIATES

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:38.844

OF. THE THINGS I THINK COULD BE

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.560
HELPFUL IS. IF WE'RE ABLE TO

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:56.428
CONVERT THOSE SAVINGS INTO

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:58.430
RESOURCES THAT END UP PROVIDING

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:01.733
HOUSING SUPPORTS FOR FOLKS WHO-

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.469
ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED I

02:09:03.535 --> 02:09:04.503
ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO START

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:07.306
DOING THAT PLANNING WHILE

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:09.641
PEOPLE ARE STILL INCARCERATED.

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:11.410
BEFORE SOMEONE IS RELEASED

02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:13.912
FIGURING OUT A HOUSING PLAN

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:17.382
WITH FOLKS WHO ARE ABOUT TO

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.084
LEAVE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.220
ENSURING THAT THOSE RESOURCES

02:09:21.286 --> 02:09:23.222
ARE ACTUALLY TIED TO THEIR

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.824
EXIT. RATHER THAN THEM HAVING

02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:28.427

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:30.429
FIND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:33.332
MEET THEIR NEEDS I THINK- IS A

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:35.968
CHALLENGE AND SO PUTTING THOSE

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:38.003
RESOURCES ACTUALLY. ARE

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:40.172
ATTACHED TO BOOKS REMITTANCES

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.306
WORKING WITH PROBATION

DEPARTMENTS WORKING WITH PAROLE

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:44.943
AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:47.079
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE SO WHEN

02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:49.548
SOMEONE IS INCARCERATED YOU

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:51.650
START THAT PLANNING SIX MONTHS

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:52.317
THAT YOU'RE BEFORE THEIR

THEY'RE SEAMLESSNESS

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:57.189
COORDINATION BETWEEN THEIR EXIT

02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:59.324
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:00.759
WHEN THEY COME HOME AND TRY TO

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:02.094
RE INTEGRATE INTO THEIR

02:10:02.161 --> 02:10:04.129
COMMUNITIES. WHERE TO FIND

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:06.298

IT'S CRITICAL AND YOU KNOW THE

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.444
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

PROP TWO OH NINE AND SOME OTHER

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:22.748
THINGS HAVE TO USE. OTHER

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.616
PROXIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

02:10:24.683 --> 02:10:29.254
RACIAL DISPARITIES BUT I WONDER.

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:29.821

THAT WE MAKE A DIRECT

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.666
CONNECTION TO CONNECT THOSE
