OF THE DATE APPEAR TO BE MORE

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.905
BENIGNLY AFFECTED OTHERS

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.240
PERCENT. TAX PROBABLY LESS OF

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.875
THAN BY THE FLU. AND THAT

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.178
SENIORS UNDENIABLY ARE THE ONES

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.546
ARE MOST AT RISK AND THOSE WITH

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.814
CHRONIC UNDERLYING CONDITIONS

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.781
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.249
THE MITIGATION STRATEGY. TO

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.985
DECREASE EXPOSURE OF PEOPLE WHO

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.720
ARE SICK TO SENIORS AND TO

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.289
DECREASE EXPOSURE OF SENIORS TO

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.924
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE SET. AND

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.360
GATHERING AREAS IT CETERA. SO

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:43.462
WHAT ARE WE RECOMMENDING- IN

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.464
SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND THIS IS

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.466
ALSO RAPIDLY CHANGING AS I YOU

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.634
GUYS PROBABLY SAW AS YOU'RE

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.136
WALKING IN THE CDC JUST

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.104
IMPLEMENTED NEW GUIDELINES- TEN

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:55.341
PAGES WORTH OF GUIDELINES. FOR

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.476
THE MITIGATION STRATEGY. BUT IN

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:58.911
MITIGATION STRATEGY WE ARE

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.513
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.682
TO STAY HOME. THESE ARE NON THE

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.884
NON- HIGH RISK PEOPLE PEOPLE

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.586
ARE SICK TO STAY HOME. PEOPLE

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.321
WHO ARE SICK AND HAVE SYMPTOMS

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.356
THAT ARE SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.724
TO CALL THEIR DOCTOR BEFORE

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.292
THEY GO INTO THE URGENT CARE

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.160
CENTER OR TO THE DOCTOR'S

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.262
OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.463
CAN'T TREAT THE CASE FROM HOME.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.865
PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:22.201
SERIOUS- COMPS SYMPTOMS. OR

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.336
LIFE THREATENING SYMPTOMS

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.270
OBVIOUSLY SHOULD GO TO THE

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.005
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM AND

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:26.606
PART OF THE REASON FOR

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.440
MEDICATION STRATEGIES TO

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.242
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.777
COMING INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.646
AND HOSPITALS TO MAINTAIN. OUR

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.382
SIR PASSAGE IF YOU IF YOU WELL

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.050
BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.418
PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT COME IN

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.987
THERE WITH THE INTERNET IS VERY

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:44.590
COME. FOR THIS. ON THE SIDE. WE

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.025
ARE RECOMMENDING THAT DAY AVOID

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.193
AND THIS IS ALSO IN THE CDC

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.829
GUIDELINES. THAT THEY AVOID-

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:52.164
MASS GATHERINGS- AND INCLUDING

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.267
PLACES WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE-

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.969
ACCUMULATE LIKE MALLS. GROCERY

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.572
STORES IF YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.740
KIDS WHO CAN GO TO YOUR GROCERY

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.208
STORE FOR YOU AT LEAST GO ON

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.709
OFF HOURS AND GET TWO OR THREE

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.645
WEEKS AT A TIME. MAKE SURE YOU

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.980
HAVE. THE MEDICATIONS ON HAND

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.148
THAT CAN BE MAILED TO YOU

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.151
VENTURA PET- POTENTIALLY. AND

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.152
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.122
AVOIDING HE EVENTS. WHERE YOU

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.391
DON'T NEED TO GO TO. SO THAT'S

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:19.692
THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.527
THE FOLLOWING IN THE COUNTY.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.296
AND IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A CHANGE

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:29.168
OF THE PEOPLES THAT WE GAVE. UP

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.672
ON CONTAINMENT BUT EXACTLY. AT

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.973
COLLEGE. THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.142
DAY. QUE NOW. AND IT MAKES TO

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.678
AND DECREASE THE SPREAD OF THE

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.379
DISEASE FURTHER I'M

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.347
PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO ARE

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.616
AT SIGNIFICAN NO SIGNIFICANT

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:44.083
RISK OF KIND OF HEALTH

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:50.990
CONDITIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:54.260

INTO IF YOU WERE WANTED UP OUR

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.066
FELLOWS TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE A

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.934
COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR SACRAMENTO

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:08.641
SPECIFIC THINGS. OR NOT. I

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.142

HERE APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY SO

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.083
NEXT SO WE'LL JUST GO DOWN THE

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:18.384
LINE OR WOULD YOU LIKE DR SONI

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.885
ANGEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.687

SO ALSO DOCTOR FOR THAT THAT

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.697
ENTERED BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.999
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:33.766
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THIS IS

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.670
THAT IT IS VERY LOCAL IN OUR

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:39.472
EXPERIENCE OF IT RIGHT SO

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.040
COMMUNITIES ARE HAVING

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:43.242
DIFFERENT RATES OF THEIR FIRST

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.844
TRAVEL RELATED CASE OR THEIR

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.012
FIRST CASE OF COMMITTEE

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:48.080
TRANSMISSION AND AS SUCH ARE

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.415
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN REACTING

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.283
AND RESPONDING BUT THE STATE OF

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.852
CALIFORNIA IS MADE UP OF MANY

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.254
CAL COMMUNITIES AND SO HAVING

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.756
THIS PICTURE OF ONE AND A VERY

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.190
DEAR LOCAL ONE AND ALSO WHEN IT

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.592
IS IT IS EXPERIENCING A FAIR

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.260
BURDEN. OF DISEASE AT THE TIME

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.361
AT THIS TIME I THINK IS A

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.295
REALLY IMPORTANT WAY TO OPEN IT

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.598
UP TO REALLY GET A SENSE OF

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:08.634
WHERE IN FACT PERHAPS OF MOST

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.069
IF NOT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:12.705
OF MAY GET TO- COULD VERY WELL

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.774
GET TO- BUT THE WHOLE REASON

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.042
THAT WE ARE REACTING AND

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:16.642
RESPONDING IN THE WAY THAT WE

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.210
ARE IS THA WE ARE WORKING VERY

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:21.047
HARD TO EITHER DELAY OR PREVENT

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:22.748
THAT FROM HAPPENING- IN ALL OF

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:23.949
OUR COMMUNITIES LET ME JUST

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:28.354
TAKE A QUICK STEP BACK. IN A

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.289
AND I AT FIRST THE KNOWLEDGE

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.424
AND- THIS OP. BECAUSE ONE OF

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.526
THE- MùT. IN ALLEN OF A NEW

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:34.827
VIRUS THAT COMES INTO THE

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.762
COMMUNITY IS. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:38.097
RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.332
IT'S NEW. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.801
AFRAID. AND WHEN IS

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.035
COMPLEMENTED BY A LOT OF

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.703
MISINFORMATION WHICH THERE IS

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.138
WHEN ANYTHING'S NEW PEOPLE CAN

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.306
MAKE UP STUFF THERE ISN'T AS

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.674
MUCH SCIENCE TO SAY THAT'S NOT

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.976
TRUE THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT STARTS

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.278
TO FEED THAT THE F. FUEL THE

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.880
FIRE AND- AND SO I THINK AN

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:55.815
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.650
HAVE HERE ALL OF THE- IS TO

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.418
SHARE THE FACTS. THAT YOU CAN

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.386
ALSO SHARE THEM IN YOUR

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.787
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT IS THE

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:03.255
ONE THING. WILL HELP US ADDRESS

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:05.191
TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY IS WHEN

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.392
WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.894
LIMIT FEAR. AND REALLY

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:12.898
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNCERTAINTY.

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:13.999
UNCERTAINTY IS TO BE EXPECTED.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.534
AND MY TELEPHONE RINGING IS NOT

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.269
TO BE EXPECTED I APOLOGIZE FOR

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.805
THAT. BUT THEY'RE VERY CLEAR

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.307
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:22.942
PROTECT OURSELVES AS WE MOVE

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.777
FORWARD SO THIS IS A VIRUS

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:28.280
APPEARED IN- IN AT THE END OF.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:30.683
THIS VERY LAST YEAR AND- ALMOST

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:31.784
A MONTH LATER WE HAD OUR VERY

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.819
FIRST CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.287
AND THEN JUST AT THE BEGINNING

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.656
OF THIS MONTH WE HAD OUR FIRST-

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.425
ARE FOR STAFF SADLY IN OUR

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:42.495
STATE. THIS IS A THIS VIRUS AND

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.563
AT AS DR- BILLIONS IN WAS IT

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.165
MENTIONED HAS ALSO BROUGHT US

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.700
ON A PATH WHICH FIRST STARTED

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.401
IN TERMS OF INTERVENTIONS WITH

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:51.036
A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.404
CONTAINMENT SO YOU RECALL THAT

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.173
WE- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.008
FOCUSING ON PEOPLE. ENTERING

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.810
THE COUNTRY FROM ABROAD PEOPLE

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.478
ENTERING SPECIFICALLY TO BEGIN

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.347
WITH FROM CHINA ALL KINDS OF

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:02.481
THE MONITORING THAT WOULD OCCUR

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.683
IF THEY LET CAME FROM CHINA

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.318
OVERALL AND IN FACT QUARANTINE

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.486
IF THEY CAME FROM THE EPICENTER

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:10.656
OF WHERE THE- INFECTION FIRST

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:11.590
WAS DETECTED. THAT IS A

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.859
STRATEGY THAT VERY EARLY ON IS

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.361
OFTEN IMPLEMENTED BUT AT SOME

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.196
POINT IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE GET

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:17.730
TO THE POINT OF COMMUNITY

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.798
TRANSMISSION. THAT CONTAINMENT

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.734
FOCUS THAT FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.835
REALLY TRYING TO GET AROUND

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.104
THEM INTO ALL CONTACT TRACING

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.005
TO PREVENT. ANYBODY ELSE FROM

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:27.606
GETTING IT. BECOMES LESS

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.575
EFFECTIVE. AND WE START TO MOVE

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.209
TOWARDS IS PERIOD OF

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.745
MITIGATION. AND IN MITIGATION I

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:33.812
THINK IT'S EASIEST TO DESCRIBE

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.881
IT AS FROM GOING TO FOCUSING ON

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.349
INDIVIDUALS. TO GOING TO

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.485
FOCUSING ON COMMUNITIES AND WE

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:40.753
ARE MAKING THAT TRANSMITS

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.321
TRANSITION NOW AND I USE THAT

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.255
LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU HEAR THAT

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.790
A LOT IN THE MEDIA RIGHT NOW.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.192
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO CLEAR

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.993
WHAT IT MEANS TO GO FROM. A

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.828
CONTAINMENT TO MITIGATION BUT

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.130
IN ESSENCE WHERE WE'RE REALLY

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.731
FOCUSING A LOT OF OUR TIME AND

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:54.099
RESOURCES NOW IS MAKING SURE

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.501
THAT THOSE POPULATION WHO ARE.

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:56.869
MOST VULNERABLE THE ONES WHO

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.637
ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET INTO.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:13:59.905
SERIOUS TROUBLE IF THEY ARE IN

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.674
FACT INFECTED ARE PREVENTED

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.809
FROM BEING EXPOSED THAT'S OUR

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:05.477
FOCUS AT THIS TIME AND THAT'S

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.846
WHERE WE'RE ALL MOVING

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:08.814
TOGETHER. SO AS WE MAKE THIS

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.816
TRANSITION. FROM INDIVIDUAL

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.919
CASES TO COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.521
AT APPROPRIATELY OUR APPROACH

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.356
IS ARE ALSO CHANGING AND THAT'S

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.190
WHY YOU'RE HEARING DIFFERENT

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.425
ACTIVITIES GOING ON ACROSS

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.826
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AT

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.494
DIFFERENT RATES. SO IN

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.396
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOW REACHED

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.532
A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.500
SEVEN CASES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:29.835
THREE OF THOSE. ARE NOT REALLY

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.570
RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.138
FLIGHT SO THERE IS A SMALL

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.007
NUMBER. THAT HAS NOT CHANGED

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.443
ITS AT TWENTY FOUR THAT WAS DUE

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:38.410
TO THE REPATRIATION FLIGHTS

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.546
THAT CAME INTO THE- THE STATE

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:41.680
WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE GROWTH

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:43.782
NOW. IS IN TRAVEL RELATED AND

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.618
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION LARGELY

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:49.188
HERE IN THE STATE I WANNA SAY A

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.890
LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR RESPONSE

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:54.326
TODAY BECAUSE WHILE MANY PEOPLE

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.262
MAY HAVE THINK OF OUR RESPONSE

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.230
HAVING STARTED. YOU KNOW WHEN

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.099
WE FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT IN FACT

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.800
OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN GOING ON

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.370
FOR OVER A DECADE. WE STARTED

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:06.272
PLANNING FOR A PANDEMIC LONG

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:08.007
AGO AND THOSE PLANS HAVE

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.842
CONTINUED TO BE UPDATED AND

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.910
REVISED OVER TIME FROM OUR

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.112
EXPERIENCE WITH THE BALL OUT

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.847
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OF H. ONE

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.315
AND ONE AND THE SECOND THAT WE

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:17.916
HEARD ABOUT THIS AGAIN WE-

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:19.852
DUSTED OFF AGAIN DUSTING OFF

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.086
ISN'T PERHAPS THE RIGHT

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:22.454
DIRECTION BECAUSE IT SITS. IN A

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.356
COMPUTER BUT WE PULLED IT OUT

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.491
AND STARTED GOING THROUGH IN

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:27.293
THINKING VERY QUICKLY AND EVER

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.627
SINCE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS AS

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.396
WE GOT NEW INFORMATION

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:30.929
UNDERSTANDING THE MODE OF

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:33.399
TRANSMISSION THE INCUBATION

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.033
PERIOD THE DURATION OF

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.201
INFECTIVITY. UNDERSTANDING

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.636
WHERE IT'S MOVING AROUND THE

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.138
WORLD AT WHAT RATE AND AROUND

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.539
THE COUNTRY WE'VE CONTINUED TO

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.409
REVISE OUR APPROACH AND WE'VE

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:47.079
CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE CHANGING

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:48.213
INTERVENTIONS THAT RELATE TO

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.015
THAT. ACROSS THIS ENTIRE TIME

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.550
COURSE WE'VE BEEN VERY

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.951
AGGRESSIVE AT RELEASING

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.220
GUIDANCE GUIDANCE THAT APPLIES

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.022
TO SPECIFIC POPULATIONS FOR

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:00.259
EXAMPLE GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS.

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.494
UGH GUIDE OUR COMMUNITY

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.096
MEASURES A GUIDANCE FOR WORK

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.231
PLACES ALL OF THOSE AREAS WHERE

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.399
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.835
THEY IN EVIDENCE TRANSLATES

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:14.306
INTO WAY WE ALL OF US BEHAVE

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:15.574
EVERY DAY AND COMMUNITIES AND

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.576
HOME WILL PLAY. IN THE PLACE

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.946
WHERE WE WORSHIP AND WE PLAY WE

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:24.316
ALSO IN. TING PHONE CALLS AND

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.820

PLANNED FOR. AND LEADERS.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:33.125
BECAUSE IN THE END THE THINGS

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.660
THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO MAKE

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.128
SURE THAT WE ARE. ON THE

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.163
FRONTLINE OF ISMAKING SURE

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.932
THAT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.367
UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES ARE

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:42.801
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND CAN USE

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.636
THEM IN A WAY THAT IS GUIDED BY

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.171
THE EVIDENCE. AND MAKING SURE

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.673
THAT OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.742
IN PARTICULAR HAS THE RESOURCES

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.277
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:53.579
RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. THOSE ARE

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:55.314
THE TWO AREAS WHERE WE SPENT

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.750
MOST OF OUR TIME FOCUSING ON.

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:59.852
CONCURRENTLY WITH THAT WE'VE

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:01.220
ALSO BEEN GATHERING AT THE

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.122
STATE LEVEL SO WE ARE ACTIVATED

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.823
AT LEVEL ONE RESPONSE RIGHT NOW

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.392
THAT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.726
RESPONSE THAT CAN EXISTED BUT

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.928
IN IN RISK. IN RESPONSE TO AN

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.731
EMERGENCY- WE HAVE DONE A TABLE

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.266
TOP THAT IS INCLUDED ALL OF OUR

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.935
SENIOR GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP.

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.504
ACROSS EVERY AGENCY THAT THE

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.372
GOVERNMENT HAS TO THINK VERY

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.841
CAREFULLY NOT ONLY ABOUT HOW IT

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.443
AFFECTS GOVERNMENT BUT HOW ALL

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.944
OF OUR RESOURCES IN GOVERNMENT.

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.946
SHOULD AND CAN BE MOBILIZED TO

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:29.581
BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.383
AS WE UNDERSTAND. THE WAY THE

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.385
DISEASE'S MOVING WE'VE INVESTED

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.920
IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:37.956
TESTING IN THE STATE. I IN OUR

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.758
PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AND I'M

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:41.660
DOCTOR WHAT WE'LL TALK MORE

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.095
ABOUT THAT AS WELL. MAKE SURE

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.164
THAT WE ARE A WHEN THE STING IN

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.366
VAIL TO GET AVAIL THE IN

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.201
PARTICULAR IN THOSE CASES. THAT

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.537
IT CAN AND IS IN CRITICAL TO

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:54.573
DIVIDE TO. GUIDE TREATMENT AND

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.910
MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS IN ALL

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:59.478
OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANTED AS

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:00.479
THOUGH THAT OF THE THINGS THAT

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:03.015
NO MATTER WHERE YOU SIT IN WHAT

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.551
SYSTEM YOU ARE THE WITH THE IF.

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:06.785
A CRITICAL THING IS THAT WE

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:10.255
BOTH STAY INFORMED AND SO THE

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:13.492
CDC. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.726
LOCAL AND COUNTY HEALTH

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:15.727
DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:17.429
ALL HAVE WEBSITES WHERE WE PUSH

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.865
OUT THE MOST RECENT FACTS AND

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.934
ALSO THE MOST RECENT GUIDANCE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.469
AND SO AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.369
YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.438
OFFICER IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.607
INDIVIDUAL. TO GOT TO RECEIVE

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.910
GUIDANCE FROM- AND YOU'RE AT AS

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.011
AGREED TO BY YOUR LOCAL

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:34.346
GOVERNMENTS TO GET GUIDANCE

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.748
FROM ON HOW TO ACT THAT'S MOST

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.016
APPROPRIATE FOR UNDERSTANDING

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.918
OF KOBE NINETEEN IN YOUR

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.588
COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO BEING

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:43.322
HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:46.258
USING THE FACTS TO GUIDE- THE

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.960
TO SHARE AND TO GUIDE AND

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.361
UNDERSTANDING AND TO MANAGE-

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:50.729
THE FACTOR OF FEAR THAT

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.097
CERTAINLY CAN ARISE IN THE

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.166
SITUATION. THE OTHER THING THAT

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.701
ALL OF US NEED TO DO IS JUST

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:56.768
THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT WE

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.504
SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY DURING

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.072
FLU SEASON TO PREVENT- THE

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:01.740
MOVEMENT OF VIRUSES WHICH

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.842
INCLUDES COVERING OUR VOWS OF

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.644
WHEN WE COUGH OR SNEEZE.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.279
WASHING OUR HANDS FREQUENTLY

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.414
AND IMPORTANTLY STAYING HOME IF

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.117
YOU'RE NOT WELL ALL OF US NO

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.819
MATTER WHAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:14.887
KEY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.688
AT THIS TIME BECAUSE EVEN IF

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:19.024
IT'S NOT COVERT NINETEEN. IF

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:22.494

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.002
GETTING YOUR FLU SHOT ALSO IS

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.637

AND THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES IT

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.142
HAS NOW BEEN NAMED. SARS

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:47.112
CORONAVIRUS TO. OR SARS KOBE

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:51.316
TO- AND THIS NAME WAS ASSIGNED

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.618
BY AN INTERNATIONAL CAN. IT HAS

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:56.989
THE- GIVEN NAMES. AND THEY

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:57.623
STILL DID ON THIS NAME BECAUSE

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.425
THE- GEN. RELAY OF NEW. TO

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:02.661
OTHER VIRUSES IS CLOSEST TO THE

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.396
SARS CORONAVIRUS SO I GUESS

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:06.198
THEY DECIDED WILL CALL IT SARS

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:08.667
CORONAVIRUS TO. I'M THAT'S A

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:10.068
LITTLE BIT CONFUSING THOUGH

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.603
BECAUSE THIS VIRUS DOES NOT

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.772
COST SARS IT CAUSES CORONA

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.475
VIRUS DISEASE TWENTY NINETEEN

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.376
AND THAT DISEASES DIFFERENT

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.510
THAN SARS THEY'RE BOTH

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.779
RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES. BUT

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:21.880
THEIR DIFFERENCE LET ME TALK A

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.282
LITTLE BIT ABOUT CORONA VIRUS

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:24.883
DISEASE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.219
IT. IT'S PRIMARILY A

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.154
RESPIRATORY ILLNESS THE MOST

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.390
COMMON SYMPTOMS ARE FEVER COUGH

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:34.092
AND FATIGUE SO IN OTHER WORDS

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:37.529
CORONAVIRUS DISEASE TWENTY

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:38.130
NINETEEN LOOKS AND FEELS A LOT

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.465
LIKE THE FLOW. AND MORE ALSO I

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:42.100
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MANY

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.502
PEOPLE WHO HAVE INFECTION WITH

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.671
SARS CORONAVIRUS TO HAVE NO

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:48.306
SYMPTOMS AT ALL AND THOSE WHO

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:50.542
DO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS HAVE MILD

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.177
ILLNESS AND MOST OF THEM CAN BE

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:54.112
MANAGED AT HOME DOING THE

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.014
NORMAL THINGS THAT WE WOULD

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:56.615
RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH THE

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.151
FLU. IN SOME LARGE STUDIES FROM

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:02.788
CHINA ABOUT 80% OF RECOGNIZED

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.990
CASES HAVE EITHER NO SYMPTOMS

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:08.326
AT ALL OR MILD SYMPTOMS. NOW

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.829
ABOUT 20% OF THE RECOGNIZED

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.265
ILLNESSES- HAVE REQUIRED

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:15.801
HOSPITALIZATION IN CHINA WE

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:16.601
DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT'S

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.836
GOING TO BE WHETHER THERE'LL BE

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.071
SOME DIFFERENCES HERE IN THE

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.005
UNITED STATES WERE WATCHING

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:22.340
THAT CLOSELY. THIS MAY ACTUALLY

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:25.143
BE- AN OVER ESTIMATE BECAUSE I

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.378
THINK THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.413
THAT SOME OF THE LESS SERIOUS

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.514
INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.950
RECOGNIZED SO FAR. BUT FROM

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:35.287
CHINA ABOUT 20% OF THE- CASES

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.823
HAVE REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION

00:22:37.889 --> 00:22:38.623
MOST OF THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.158
IN THE HOSPITAL HAVE RECOVERED

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.294
AND DONE WELL. ANOTHER REASON

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.229
SOMEONE WITH COVERT NINETEEN

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:44.730
MIGHT NEED TO GO TO THE

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.732
HOSPITAL IS THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.700
PNEUMONIA OR SOME DIFFICULTY

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:50.335
BREATHING AND NEED SOME MEDICAL

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.437
SUPPORT ARE ALSO SUPPORT FOR

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.005
THEIR UNDERLYING CONDITIONS. SO

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:55.674
SOMEONE WHO HAS DIABETES FOR

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.343
EXAMPLE WHO GETS INFECTED WITH

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.745
COVERT NINETEEN MIGHT NEED

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:01.313
EXTRA HELP IN MANAGING THEIR

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:04.349
DIABETES. ABOUT 5% OF

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.485
RECOGNIZED CASES IN CHINA HAVE

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.853
REQUIRED ADMISSION TO AN

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:10.088
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. IN ABOUT

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.858
2% HAVE DIED. NOW I WANT TO

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.493
REITERATE THAT THESE DATA COME

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.194
FROM CHINA AND MOST OF THE

00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:17.729
CHINESE DATA ARE COMING FROM

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.531
THE EPICENTER OF WHERE THIS

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:21.133
VIRUS EMERGED IN WHO BAY

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.935
PROVINCE. OUTSIDE OF THAT

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:27.239
PROVINCE. IN CHINA THE

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.107
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.909
HAD A CASE OF THIS DISEASE AND-

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.478
HAVE GONE ON TO DIE IS MUCH

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:35.213
LOWER ABOUT HALF OF A PERCENT.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.581
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HERE IN

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.116
THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:39.284
AS WE LEARN ABOUT TREATING

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:42.087
COVERT NINETEEN. THE DEATH RATE

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:45.257
MAY EVEN BE LOWER. WE ALSO KNOW

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:47.826
THAT THE RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:48.460
AND DEATH IS DIFFERENT FOR

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:50.662
DIFFERENT GROUPS. SO AS DR

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:51.930
BEYONCE AND POINTED OUT THIS

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:54.833
DISEASE- HIS NAME. IS MUCH

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.034
TENDS TO BE MUCH MILDER IN

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.170
CHILDREN AND THE RISK OF SEVERE

00:23:58.236 --> 00:24:00.906
DISEASE DOES INCREASE WITH AGE

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:02.574
AND IT ALSO INCREASES FOR

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:03.708
PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNDERLYING

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.278
MEDICAL CONDITIONS. AND SOME OF

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.312
THE REPORTS FROM CHINA HAVE

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:09.014
INDICATED THAT THE RISK OF

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.383
SEVERE DISEASE. GOES UP AS

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.385
PEOPLE GET INTO THEIR SIXTIES

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:14.653
SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND

00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:19.024
INCREASES AS PEOPLE GET OLDER.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.458
SO AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:23.061
WHAT THAT. PICTURE OF THIS IS

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.429
GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:26.398
AREA OF THE PROPORTION OF

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:28.633
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE DISEASE

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.468
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES- AS

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:32.904
DOCTOR ANGEL POINTED OUT-

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.372
PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.741
POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.043
OLDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.377
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.313
HAS BEEN A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:42.948
RESPONSE AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:46.151
BE. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:48.820
MITIGATION FACE. LET ME SAY A

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.789
FEW WORDS ABOUT TREATMENT TO

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:51.990
RIGHT NOW TREATMENT IS

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.059
PRIMARILY SUPPORTIVE THAT MEANS

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:55.894
MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMS AND

00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:57.829
SUPPORTING GENERAL HEALTH.

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.564
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.033
TREATMENTS FOR- COVERT NINETEEN

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.535
BUT LET ME SAY MORE ALSO MORE

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.103
ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE. PEOPLE

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.672
WITH MILD ILLNESS CAN STAY HOME

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:08.640
AND FOLLOW THE USUAL ADVICE FOR

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:10.842
THE FLU. REST GET PLENTY OF

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:12.811
FLUIDS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.145
STAYING AWAY FROM OTHERS WHILE

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:16.281
THEY'RE SEC. IF SOMEONE DOES

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.083
NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED THEY

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:19.618
MAY BE TREATED WITH XYGEN AND

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:20.852
FLUIDS AND GIVING CARE FOR

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:22.187
THEIR UNDERLYING MEDICAL

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.356
CONDITIONS IF THEY HAVE ANY. IN

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.524
AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. MORE

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:28.627
INTENSIVE BREEDING SUPPORT CAN

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:32.931
BE PROVIDED. NOW BACK TO

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.399
MEDICATIONS THERE ARE SOME

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:35.734
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.369
BEING TESTED TO SEE IF THEY ARE

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:39.838
EFFECTIVE AGAINST COVERT

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:40.672
NINETEEN THESE MEDICATIONS ARE

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:42.207
AVAILABLE NOW AND ARE BEING

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:44.376
USED FOR SEVERELY ILL PEOPLE IN

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:46.411
THE UNITED STATES AND AS MORE

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:48.013
PEOPLE GET TREATED WE WILL

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.414
LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.416
THESE MEDICATIONS ARE. AND IT'S

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:53.084
POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT

00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:54.686
MONTH OR TWO WE MAY HAVE

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:56.354
INFORMATION ABOUT EFFECTIVE

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.556
TREATMENTS FOR COVERT NINETEEN

00:25:58.623 --> 00:25:59.357
THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.226
VALUABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH MORE

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:03.762
SEVERE DISEASE. IN CLOSING I

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:04.796
JUST WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.131
VACCINES BECAUSE THAT'S A

00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:07.966
COMMON QUESTION WORK HAS

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.734
STARTED ON A COVERT NINETEEN

00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.436
VACCINE. BUT VACCINE

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.038
DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING IS MUCH

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.572
MORE DIFFICULT THAN TESTING

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:15.840
MEDICATION SO THIS IS NOT A

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.943
MATTER OF MONTHS AS I INDICATED

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.644
IT WOULD BE FOR MEDICATIONS.

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.780
USUALLY VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.616
TESTING TAKES YEARS WITH THE

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:25.917
INTENSE EFFORT THAT'S BEING

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:27.552
FOCUSED ON COVERT NINETEEN

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.187
INCLUDING VACCINE DEVELOPMENT.

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.356
THE TIMELINE MIGHT BE SHORTENED

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.524
BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.125
AT LEAST A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE

00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:36.928
WE SEE A FULLY READY TO GO-

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.064
VACCINE FOR THIS CONDITION. SO

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.734
THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:44.035

CONVEY AN AREA OF EXPERTISE. I%

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:23.975
AM A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS

YOUR ELEMENT FOR OTHERS AND

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:37.882

GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH

DURATION OF WHAT WE EXPECT THIS

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:01.505
OUTBREAK TO BE IT'S AN UNFAIR

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.140
QUESTION I REALIZED BUT IS

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:06.377

REALLY LASTED FOR. MANY MONTHS

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:34.739

SO- I CAN GIVE YOU A PRECISE

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:42.313

PLANNING AND WOOD AND

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:45.850
DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.018
BE THINKING IN ASKING THIS VERY

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.386
QUESTION SHOULD BE THINKING

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:54.291
ABOUT. MONTHS ALSO ADDED ON.

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:55.926
PART OF THIS. AS ENTER GOING

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.094
FROM CONTAINMENT TO SORT OF A

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.162
MIX CONTAINMENT MITIGATION

00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:00.364
APPROACH. IS NOT BECAUSE WE

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:01.332
THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:02.566
PREVENT EVERY ANY FURTHER

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.502
SPREAD WERE REALLY JUST TRYING

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:06.637
TO SLOW IT DOWN- WE WANT TO

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.272
SLOW DOWN LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.607
BE ABLE TO BRING THE TREATMENTS

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.509
ONLINE AND VACCINATIONS ONLINE.

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.077
AND WHEN WE GET THOSE TWO VERY

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.446
IMPORTANT TOOLS THEN WE SORT OF

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.014

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.652
EVERYONE TO GET THEIR FLU SHOT

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.387

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:25.289
REALLY HAVE A BETTER- SENSE OF

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.391
MANAGEMENT OF THIS- MANY OF THE

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:29.693
MITIGATION ALSO ACTIVITIES THAT

THAT ARE GOOD PRACTICE FOR US

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.117
ANYWAY SO I THINK WILL BENEFIT

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.618
FROM LESSONS LEARNED. FOR MUCH

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.453
LONGER TIME PERIOD THAN JUST AS

KIND OF TEST AND- FOR THOSE

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.345
THAT. AREN'T USING THOSE IN

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.279

HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:37.988
CAPACITY. BUT ONCE COMMERCIAL

OF THE IMPORTANT ROLES OF THE

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.286
PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES IS

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:52.189

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:29.960
QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH

SENIOR SURE TALKING SOMEWHERE

FIFTY TWO UP TO A HUNDRED SO

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:47.311
YOU HAVE A BIG VARIETY. OF

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:50.380
PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES INTERVIEW

TRAVEL FOR A HEALTHY SIXTY YEAR

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.123
OLD AS COMPARED TO SOMEONE YOU

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.491
KNOW CERTAINLY WHO IS IMMUNO

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:06.797
SUPPRESSED AT THE- AT THAT AGE.

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.065
YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:10.801
AND I THINK THAT- INTO SOME OF

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.069
THESE DECISIONS ARE DECISIONS

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.971
THAT- INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:15.639
BE THINKING ABOUT BASED ON

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.541
THEIR OWN HEALTH STATUS AND

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.942
POTENTIALLY IN INCOME

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:19.910
CONSULTATION WITH THEIR

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.378
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS I WOULD

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.446
CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:24.381
HAVE THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.582
TO TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR ABOUT

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.851
THEM CERTAINLY THE RISK DOES

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.854
INCREASE WITH AGE- ACROSS THAT

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:33.824
SPAN OF OLDER FOLKS I'M AS WELL

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:35.826
AS AS AS YOU MENTIONED

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:36.293
UNDERLYING HEALTH CARE

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.428
UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS-

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:40.597
DO PLAY A ROLE- AND I THINK

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.132
PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO THINK

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.067
ABOUT THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.135
AND MAKE TO. DECISIONS THAT

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:46.803
MAKES SENSE FOR THE FOR THEM

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:50.774
AND WHAT THEY'RE REALITIES ARE

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.476
BUT WE WOULD DEFINITELY-

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:53.610
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.145
INCREASED RISK TO BE ASKING

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:57.381
THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. TO BE

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.348
THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN

00:46:58.415 --> 00:47:00.150
TAKE SOME OF THESE COMMONSENSE

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.618
MEASURE LIKE REDUCING THEIR

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:03.954
EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:07.591
STAYING AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.825
ARE ILL STAYING AWAY SETTING

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:11.395
WHERE TRACK. IT COMMON OR OR OR

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:16.200

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:19.102
SERIOUSLY WITH TO CRUISES HAS

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.571
COME OUT WITH GUIDANCE JUSTIN

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.339
LAST FEW DAYS ADVISING WHO ARE

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.740
OLDER OR HOW UNDER HEALTH

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:26.143
CONDITIONS TO AVOID CRUISES-

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.878
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S A PLACE

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:28.979
WHERE TRANSMISSION IF IT DOES

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.981
HAPPEN- CAN HAPPEN PRETTY

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:33.250
BROADLY SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.085
YOUR QUESTION OKAY BECAUSE WHAT

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:36.820
I'M SAYING AND BASICALLY A

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.657
HEALTHY SYSTEM SAID OF THE

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:43.060
YOUNGER SENIOR. IF YOU CALL IT.

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:46.363
IS THAT THERE A LOT OF. INTO

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.764
OUR SOME IS BECAUSE ABOUT YOU I

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:50.601
GO TO THE SHOULD I NOW. IN A BY

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.202
EVERY SET OF YOU KNOW EVERY

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:53.570
BOTTLE OF PARRAL OR LYSOL

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:55.405
CLEANER YOU KNOW IS IT SAFE FOR

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.907
ME TO PICK UP THE GRAND KIDS

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.575
FROM SCHOOL I MEAN I THINK

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.544
WE'RE GENERATING A HUGE AMOUNT

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.380
OF FEAR FOR. OF A FAIRLY

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:04.915
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:06.950
POPULATION ONE ONLY A PORTION

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:10.153
OF THAT. ARE REALLY HAVE THE-

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:14.891
YOU KNOW- CONCERNS. CAN I JUST

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.727
SIT ON A MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:17.694
I THINK IT'S JUST A REALLY

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:20.597
IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT-

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:23.367
MISINFORMATION INFORMATION AND

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.534
WE THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:26.169
CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.604
WITH YOU TO ME I FEEL LIKE THIS

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.172
ISN'T ONE MORE OF THE DIALOGUE

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.007
THAT I HAVE ALL DAY LONG

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:30.907
LEARNING. COMMUNITIES ARE

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.876
RESPONDING AND THAT'S A REALLY

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.044
IMPORTANT POINT THAT I THINK

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:36.280
THAT WE AND OTHERS PROBABLY

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.348
COULD BE A LITTLE MORE CLEAR-

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.316
ABOUT MESSAGING WE TALKED TO

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:41.218
POPULATIONS BECAUSE THAT. OUR

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.420
AUDIENCE- BUT IF THE

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.122
INDIVIDUALS THAT HERE THAT

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.990
INFORMATION IF IT'S CREATING

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.091
GREATER CONCERN AND WE REALLY

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:48.825
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:49.893
RESPOND TO THAT MESSAGING SO

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.029
IT. MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:52.963
IS TO LOOK BACK AT OUR WEBSITE

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.864
TO BE SURE THAT WE HELP PEOPLE

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.432
UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.601
INFORMATION ABOUT. ABOUT THAT

00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:00.170
RELATIVE RISK THAT SAID THIS IS

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:06.510
THE WE'RE ALL LEARNING MORE

00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:09.513
ABOUT AND IT DOESN'T HURT ANY

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:10.547
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT. IT IS

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:15.319
YOU ARE. ENVIRONMENT LET'S

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.653
BEING WITH SIX FEET OF SOMEONE

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.155
THAT IS SNEEZING PUTS YOU AT

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.523
RISK IF THEY HAVE CO NINETEENTH

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.091
JUST BEING AWARE OF THAT

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:23.093
ENVIRONMENT ISN'T- BAD FOR ANY

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.561
OF US AND I THINK CAN ALSO HELP

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.129
BELIEVE FEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:28.165
HOW IT'S TRANSMITTED AND WE

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.099
KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE WASH

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:29.633
YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY AT

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.535
VETERAN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:34.971
CAN. AND ALL JUST. IN UP LITTLE

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:35.806
BIT MORE TO THAT OF HOW WE'RE

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.341
LOOKING AT IT AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:38.775
OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE REALLY

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:41.244
ASKING PEOPLE TO EVALUATE OF

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.847
ALL TRAVEL. AND WHETHER IT IS

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.749
ESSENTIAL OR NON ESSENTIAL AND

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.551
WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DEFINE.

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:50.754
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. AND

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.557
IF- IF WE HAVE TO TRAVEL. AND

00:49:53.623 --> 00:49:55.392
WE KNOW WE WILL PEOPLE WILL

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:59.029
HAVE TO TRAVEL. DURING THIS

00:49:59.096 --> 00:49:59.629
PERIOD OF MONTHS THEN HOW CAN

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.132
WE- OUR- DURING TRAVEL. WHAT

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:03.700
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:05.569
TO PROTECT OUR- DURING TRAVEL.

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:08.138
IS THERE A WAY. TO DRIVE.

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.040
RATHER THAN FLY. IS THERE A

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:12.209
WAY. A IF YOU MUST FLY. CHECK

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.710
YOURSELF IN THE ENVIRONMENT

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:15.011
WHEN YOU'RE FLYING AND

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:17.381
CERTAINLY THERE ARE GOOD. OF

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:19.483
STUDIES THAT SHOW SIMPLE THINGS

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:22.085
LIKE WASHING YOUR HANDS. BEFORE

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.788
YOU ENTERED PLANE. AND AFTER

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.356
YOU LEAVE THE PLANE. CAN GO A

00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:33.063
LONG. IN OF. USING THIS FIRE.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.499
I'M I HAD A QUESTION SO MAY I'M-

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.533
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE HERE BUT

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.634
THERE. WHAT IS THE UNIQUE OF

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:41.571
THE VIRUS THAT IS- MAKING IT SO

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.907
DIFFERENT WITH SUCH A REACTION

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:46.510
GLOBALLY AFFECTING. ALL PARTS

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.645
OF THE COUNTRY AND COUNTRIES I

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:51.648
GUESS- WHERE ITALY HAD TO SHUT

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.049
DOWN ITS BORDERS AND STUFF LIKE

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:53.984
THAT WHAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.586
THIS PARTICULAR. FEEL LIKE IT'S

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:59.022
IT MIGHT CREATING MORE FEAR.

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:00.857
ARE LIKE AS SOME OF THE P. HERE

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:03.460
THIS HERE YEAH WHAT IT WHAT IS

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:05.796
IT SO YOU. VERSUS THE FLU OR

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:09.366
OTHER VIRAL DISEASES. I'D LIKE

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.268
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:11.768
CAN IT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:14.571
QUESTION. OF SO THIS VIRUS IS A

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.540
CORONA VIRUS AND THERE ARE A

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.475
NUMBER OF KNOWN HUMAN CORONA

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.811
VIRUSES THAT WE LIVE WITH ALL

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:23.447
THE TIME. EVERY YEAR AND THEY

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:27.217
CALL BECAUSE JUST SIMPLE COLDS

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:27.784
AND NO ONE EVEN THINKS ABOUT

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:30.387
THEM. SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:32.956
THIS ONE IS IT'S NEW. WE HAVE

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.892
NOT SEEN IT BEFORE. SO UNLIKE

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.727
OTHER VIRUSES THAT HAVE ADAPTED

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:39.529
TO INFECT HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.565
LIVE WITH REGULARLY BECAUSE OUR

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.767
IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE USED TO

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:46.703
THEM. THIS IS A NEW VIRUS. OUT

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.104
WE BELIEVE IT COMES FROM AN

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.639
ANIMAL AND ANIMAL ORIGIN

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.508
PROBABLY A BAT AND PERHAPS

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:54.144
ANOTHER MAMMAL THAT IT MAY HAVE

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.712
INTERACTED WITH BEFORE IT CAME

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:58.048
TO HUMANS. AND WE HAVE NO

00:51:58.114 --> 00:52:00.517
UNDERLYING IMMUNITY FOR THIS

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:03.687
VIRUS. AND SO ESSENTIALLY

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:05.722
EVERYONE IS POTENTIALLY

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:08.658
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE VIRUS AND

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.659
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT VERY

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:12.262
UNIQUE- EVERY FLU STRAIN THAT

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:15.565
COMES EACH YEAR OR- OR EVERY.

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.501
REGULAR CORONA VIRUS THAT COMES

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.269
EACH YEAR THERE'S A GROUP OF

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.937
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE SOME

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.506
IMMUNITY OR THERE MAY BE

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.407
VACCINES TO HELP US BECOME MORE

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.843
IMMUNE TO THE PARTICULAR VIRUS.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.912
AND IN THIS SITUATION IT'S JUST

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:31.882
NEW AND SO THAT'S WHY IT IS

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.049
DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:35.085
BEHAVING IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:38.788
SAYING IT BEHAVE NOW. AND I

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.323
WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK ON TO

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.458
THAT JUST BECAUSE THE QUESTION

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:43.460
THE DISTRICT OFFICE CAN WE

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.695
EXPECT THE VIRUS TO DECREASE IN

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.863
THE SUMMER AND GET. POTENTIALLY

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:47.931
WORSE IN THE FALL SIMILAR TO

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:51.601
THE SPANISH FLU IN NINETEEN

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:52.569
EIGHTEEN. THIS IS A QUESTION

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:55.605
THAT WE GET ASKED A LOT BECAUSE-

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:58.174
MANY RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DO

00:52:58.241 --> 00:52:59.776
EXACTLY THAT DATE THEY PEAK IN

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:02.512
THE WINTER AND SPRING AND-

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.080
DECREASE IN THE SUMMER AND THEN

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:06.516
BEGIN TO START TO COME BACK IN

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.286
THE FALL- WE DON'T KNOW YET

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:12.756
WHAT THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO DO.

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.157
I HOPE THAT WE'LL SEE SOME

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:17.060
DECLINE IN THE SUMMER- BECAUSE

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:18.495
OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DO

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.230
THAT BUT I CAN'T PROMISE THAT

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:26.570
THAT WILL HAPPEN. THANK YOU SO

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.470
I'M GONNA ASK YOU A FEW

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.639
QUESTIONS FROM THE OFFICES THE

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.974
DISTRICT OFFICES AND WE'LL GO

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.943
FROM THERE WHAT SHOULD WE TELL

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:34.411
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.679
ABOUT GETTING THEIR MEDICATION

00:53:35.745 --> 00:53:37.814
AND A POSSIBLE QUARANTINE HOW

00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:38.982
DO YOU GET EXTRA MEDICATION

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.483
BEFORE IS DUE FOR A REFILL

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.651
EXPRESSION OF INSURANCE

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:44.154
COMPANIES WILL PAY UNTIL IT IS

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:51.328
TIME FOR A REFILL. I NEED TO

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:52.395
GET BACK TO YOU BECAUSE OUR

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:55.465
INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS- VARIED

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:57.267
AND DIVERSE AND INCLUDES BOTH

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.769
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS. SO

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:01.371
OF WILL SEND BACK SOME

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:02.806
RESOURCES ARE REFERENCES THAT

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:03.840
PEOPLE CAN USE TO UNDERSTAND

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.175
THAT BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:07.243
THINGS THAT THAT'S GETTING OUT

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:07.811
IS THIS QUESTION OF GENERAL

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.613
PREPAREDNESS. SO THIS IS A

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:10.480
GREAT MOMENT TO REMIND

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.948
EVERYBODY WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA

COVERED NINETY. AND IT'S NOW A

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.527
IDEA TO BE PER. ALL THE TIME

00:54:24.594 --> 00:54:26.262
FOR ANY OF THESE SO MAKING SURE

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.963
THAT YOU TALK WITH YOUR

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.964
PHYSICIAN AHEAD OF TIME ABOUT

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.299
GETTING MEDICATIONS MAKING SURE

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.635
THAT YOU HAVE THEM- AT HOME. IN

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.670
CASE THINGS GET INCONVENIENT OR

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.838
ON THERE'S A PROBLEM GET YOUR

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:36.473
MEDICATION IT DOESN'T BECOME

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.340
SOMETHING THAT LIMITS YOUR

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.409
ABILITY OR GETS YOU IN- IN

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:41.177
TROUBLE PARTICULARLY AT A TIME

WHEN THERE. COULD BE A LEVEL OF

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:44.948
INCONVENIENCE AND SOME SOCIAL

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.816
DISRUPTION SO. GOOD REMINDER TO

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:49.452

RISK FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.695
AND IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR

BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I KNOW

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.295
