everybody coming here this is- the first select committee on homelessness for LA county that were hosting- here in Los Angeles- we wanted to do it here in Skid Row not just because I represent the district are because we wanted to we wanted to make the point about how urgent this issue is not the- remedy would agree. On it is the number one issue on people's minds when you walk out of the street. It is the number one issue on on our conscience and in the legislature we tried over the years to address this issue. Now we are very clear from the beginning that this is not gonna be an exercise in and finger pointing but I think it's fair to say that. At this point in time- that some of the decade old policies that we have put in place are no longer- affected were working- today. And I think it's fair to say that if we continue down that path. We're going to continue to see- the results that we just currently seem like an explosion homelessness- twelve in and 16% respectively from city and county I think we have to accept that fact. On in part of what we're doing today. Is beginning larger ever say about. About coordination- resources the best ideas what works what doesn't work. On an understanding that that today's a new day so. The things that we would have not talked about in the past. As acceptable the public policy. Except in today because- we can no longer on. We can longer avoid. The issue homelessness and we can no longer- be complacent about. Not have that sort of sense of urgency and all. All on echo what my colleague could set. A few weeks ago- Bob Hertzberg at a press conference I center Bob Hertzberg and he said. When he went up to speak he said it. I think you said three words he said urgency urgency urgency and then some more urgency. And then walked up I think the point that we were trying to make at that time. What was that we have to address it at this point in time. And we want to break the old paradigms we want to take a look at new ways of doing it. And we've good. Earth but we've got to do a little bit better could. I we had we've had great. Success working with the city we've had great success working with the county- philanthropic groups business. Groups but we've got to do it a little bit. A little bit differently I would say- let me share in an and I promise I will be as long down the line a by this issue. One of the reasons why this issue so important what struck me. And I've said this a couple times. When I first got elected to the legislature. I was happy go lucky as anybody could ever be. You get elected you get a call from the speak your member those days right. And you get a call from speaker everybody's got that call and said Hey come on up we want to discuss which want to serve on. Out happy. And on my way to the airport that one particular day it just so happened. That he had stopped at a corner and was right good right. Nice to look right down the street on in the arts district so. You could see homelessness when you walked outside of a house. The what was unique about this time it was a lot there was a lady. And a small baby. And the baby was in a stroller. And people tell us that there are no kids on the street there are kids on the street. We'll see them. And the baby was trying to grab the mom's attention. And you could imagine and now we've all seen this picture or this image. And the longer the baby tried to grab the mother's attention it seemed to me that that that that light had gone forever. And all I could remember. And it haunts me to this date of what could happen of that child. And one of those tents. What could have child is somebody given that person help. And what more could we have done. And it's at that sort of sense of urgency. But I want to start this hearing. And we'll get we'll have time for an overview but what I really want to do right now it is handed over my colleagues and then. Say one word to spend she in which I've got his political many got shown giving you don't notable que esta. Es de temas of them a must import on the guest on will be under a kia and California handicap even ask I guess to some but I seem to be the end. You look at some of that bundle that said I key. Is that that equity not most roles. As what was will keep them at hold in also lamented did out of the network problem up it'll cam was m√°s this will doubles back I handle be about. I. Over my colleagues in no particular order if you're comfortable as I. Just jump on in and say a couple of opening words and I know that we have a- a center Mitchell back their summer. She walked in. I'm sorry I apologize- in any and- if you. Would introduce yourself and it make opening comments we can start that for. We'll start with the wisest Nobody still can't see on. Thank you madam budget year. Nobody nobody should sleep on the streets in Los Angeles period and the point period and I said last time and I'll say it again urgency urgency urgency people don't care with your city government state government county government their pay in taxes they want the problem solved we need to do what we need to do it now urgency urgency urgency that's why I'm here- taking the time- supposed to be in Sacramento but when the charm. Me and ask me told me to. Bring aye my schedule to be. Because. Board center but also it is hard and I'm telling you if we don't deliver for the folks they got every right to be even matter they currently are. Good morning thank you Mister chairman for invited me I want to thank one guard on the service providers who will be educated us today here to listen to your partners in taking action. And out assemblymember Reggie Jones Sawyer I too am. Happy to be here you know. In the nineteen ninety five ninety six I was a middle aged system W. mayor which is C. of Los Angeles when we're talking about Lhasa. And Natalie Kerr creating a bit making it better. And the solutions I don't think it changed nineteen ninety five- many of it may just have been our inability to implement a lot of things and so I'm I'm here to listen to the experts. On how not not only just how we implement them but how quickly. We can get this done because I don't think we need to we have to problem anymore we need to just have a focus like a laser discussion order on solutions and how we can quickly implement them. Because my colleagues that the or me the public. Every form I go to in my district when I. Give people opportunities- we what they want me to legislate. They tell me what can the state do. To make sure that. We can do something for the people were living. Outside on the street. First of all of the thank you very much my name is Mike Gipson I represent the sixty four to so many years ago I think I'm chairman Santiago. My colleagues- and also wine garden for all of you being here- one I want to find out solutions and work and partner with- each and everyone of you I want to commend the great strong leadership of our chairman- who's a brought us all together. This is a personal issue for me- as we rated thanksgiving- I was looking for my god so. That's nine years he's on crystal meth and he's homeless. This year I said the state assembly member. Who's sitting up here has someone in the family it is homeless on the streets due to crystal meth. It's personal to me I want my child home at twenty nine years old Los mother and father both died of aids and the family never got the kind of help that really need he needed as a six year old losing both mother and father that was traumatic and now my child is somewhere on the streets. Once again. After I bottom hold him up so this is personal to me is personal me ever since two thousand fourteen I spend the night with homeless individuals the first Thursday in the month of March why do I do that. Because one is not on drugs. Everyone of you know is not looking for a hand out people who are are able wants a job and want to get off the street the same thing to each and everyone of you want for your families a roof over your head and close of your on your back. And so I'm here looking for solutions so we can try to address. This situation in our community. Hello I'm THREE OF US I represent the east San Fernando Valley and the state assembly- you know this issue- affects us all and I want to thank our chair. Assembly member Santiago in all of the panelists that we're going to learn from to day- just yesterday I visited a family care provider. Home based hell. In my district and so mark and I learned that one of the two year olds that was being taken care of sleeps in his car. With his mom in the car. And it just broke my heart and you know besides the homeless that we all see every day under the freeway is run our sidewalks there's also hidden homeless. That we don't see that are in cars motels and their children and how can we expect children to go to school and be ready to learn if they don't for the going to sleep that night and- that is something I've been working on. And I know that- this year a lot of us in the state legislature our goal. Collaborate together and work on homelessness. To we can find a solution help the local governments with the city you and I'm happy to be here and learn from all of you today. Thank you. Born one of the my name is my Dillon at the state senator representing district twenty four on the city primarily the city of Los Angeles and east LA county- thank you assembly member Santiago for pulling this all together so we can. Listen and learn and hopefully come up with strong for our- solutions- I've spent my whole life. As an organizer with low wage workers trying to help them get better for weight higher wages so that they don't end up homeless the end up on the streets. I am really concerned about the seven fifty thousand families who wore a severely over burdened. With the percentage of rent that they pay from their income so what we have to. Our first and most urgent task is our sisters and brothers and children who live on the streets- we cannot. Address that issue their issues if we don't also addressed those who Daly become homeless on so I'd like to also learn and hear from as many people as possible on that thank you very much. All the members all the. Thank you all represented here here today because- we made a lot of call these folks showed up in and they've been working extremely hard on the issue in Sacramento so we want to thank them. For to participation and- in advance thank you for your hard work this upcoming year on the issue homelessness- thank you very much. Wanna get some help- ground keeping up housekeeping rules of a members make sure you turn off your Michael is that we only have one person speaking into it so that you know that it's a live Mike unless you've turned it off that way we have the mix of their- speakers will be called up about five minutes- numbers a perverse. Way to. Thank you it. I'm and also want to. Clarify what we're here to little bits okay re provocative with each other push back in. And have that sort of conversation. Six does that helps us to get to a better place when it comes to. Solving the problems I think it's fair to say that we need- rocked the ship a little bit. Amongst ourselves and others to try to get this. Work done on the show homelessness- so those ground rules want- called the first health. And then I want to say some thanks but I've been asked to say the things at the end. So if you're a- watching my manners of would not say thank you to the host and other folks. I will be doing that towards the end wimple folks are present. So forgive me for that but be patient- and we want to. Welcome the on. The first panel. And we've title this the need for. Urgent action. And if we could have will not- Nicolas- director of center health impact evaluation for LA county department of health. And to reset aye aye- who will introduce herself I don't have the last name on me. I and then we'll begin. Okay or she may be running a little bit late none the less but if you can have that. Every in have you begin and want to talk about it a sense of urgency. Yes so yes so will Nicholas department of public health I'm here to talk about your other aspect of this homelessness crisis which is that not only are. Too many people sleeping on the streets too many people are dying on the streets- we were pleased to report a couple weeks ago in conjunction with a motion. By the board. Of supervisors to address- mortality among the homeless- and I'm gonna I'm gonna run through our- eggs. Yeah Hey. And I'm also the V. slides may be hard for you to see every slide pretty much every slide element a show is in a report that was handed out at the front by the door so you can follow along. In the report as well if that helps. Okay it's not the. Yeah really work in here. There it is okay so- all this is really about- counting the number of homelessness is it is a challenge this is a little bit- in the weeds of the methods but just so that you know. The medical examiner corner investigates the majority of homeless deaths and does collect information on homelessness death certificates don't collecting information on homelessness so we did a fair amount of- hard hard work digging deeper into the mortality data from the state and from the corner to- to get a better count of the homeless does which is part in itself so- we are able to identify seven hundred additional missed us that that would not have been. Found just based on the most basic information from the corner. So let me jump to the data here so. Over the past six years this is figure shows the homeless population has been- the mortality death among the homeless population has been rising- from. Five hundred thirty six total deaths in twenty thirteen. Two thousand forty seven deaths in twenty eighteen that's the number of deaths but- the actual rate of deaths which counts for the increase in the population of homeless. Folks has increased by over a third adopting that same time period so it's not just the number that's increasing at the rate. Of per population- it's increasing in terms of almost desk and just to just to might to close. Yeah okay. There yeah. And just what is a perspective- in two thousand eighteen New York City had about the same number of homeless in their count- but only had two hundred and ninety deaths in two hundred and eighteen compared to in two thousand eighteen compared to bar. Are thousand forty seven the next thing we did was. To try to figure out what was causing this increase in mortality rate- so we were able to link the corner dated to- causes of death in our death records. And this slide basically shows the two leading causes of death among people experiencing homelessness. Of the top two causes by you know by consider margin or coronary heart disease and drug and alcohol overdose- Corey heart disease- indicative of the aging of our our homeless population this is a phenomenal it's happening nationally as well- drug and alcohol- 88% of those were words. Were drugs versus alcohol- also in the top five leading causes were transportation related injuries and- but 82% of those were among pedestrians and cyclists so. And then also homicide and suicide and then we see little differences across- gender and racial ethnic groups for example- among African Americans corny heart disease is a lot higher than. Drug overdose among Latinos drug overdose little higher than corner heart disease also among females- drug overdose of the higher than than coronary heart disease. Next we look at. The trends over time this again is accounting for- changes in the total number of people experiencing homelessness and county. And what pops out. In this figure is- the two highest naturally the corner heart disease and drug overdose heart disease which is the red line is relatively stable so it's high but not really contributing to this increase that were saying so. The real- the biggest the take home here's the biggest because it's contributing to the increase almost more tell is that the drug and alcohol overdoses also- the- transportation related injuries as the blue line that's doubled and have so is homicide is also doubled in the past six years. So between. Between overdose deaths- transportation related and homicide that's- those are the those of the causes that are contributing most to the overall increase. Next week because we have information- from loss said they do a really good job not only of doing a home with count but they also do an estimate of the of this is a demographic characteristics of the homeless population were actually able to compare for three years because we had these demographic data for twenty sixteen through twenty eighteen we're actually able to compare- mortality rates among. Different racial ethnic groups of the homeless population- two things stand out here one is. Across all three years the way homeless population mortality rate is higher the African American and Latino- rates that might at first single car intuitive given that given how much- how over represented. African Americans are in the actual homeless population but this is something that's been found actually in in research around the country it's not a new finding and the though the running theory although its it's- the theory. Is that- the antecedents to homelessness among whites verses- African Americans may be a little different. With weights- being more likely become homeless due to severe physical and mental health issues where as- African Americans- experiencing- economic hardship. And racism and discrimination so the they're being that that white people. Reach a threshold of illness that's greater and there are therefore have higher mortality rates when they become homeless- also what you're seeing here is that the rates going down for whites but it's going up for African Americans and Latinos. That's mmhm. You can this is just data data just give you ideas for. For a policies one potential this might be happening if indeed. You know the profile of what homeless folks is that their sicker and therefore more likely to screen into- permanent supportive housing that's potentially reason why the rates might be going down for whites but- again we're in we're in communication with the- with the Lhasa who's done a whole. Report and task force on African Americans experiencing homelessness and so we're- kind of. Investigating this a little bit more. Next we also compared by gender- the rates are going up for both males and females a little bit more rapidly for females especially during the first year- but again rates higher overall for males versus females. This slide is a comparison of rates just a simple comparison of the rates of people experiencing homelessness verses the general population of LA county just to give you a sense of the- of the magnitude of the of the problem. So for all causes. People experiencing homelessness- had a mortality rate two point three times higher than the general population. Which is a little lower than what we've seen another of in the literature although most of those studies are from the northeast other countries that have different- homeless population so this is probably an indication of just the sheer size and diversity of our homeless population here. But what's most striking here is that a for the fight leading cause of death the it's of mortality for the homeless or between three and twenty six times higher than than for the general population most striking being drug and alcohol over does that's what we found that more top twenty six times higher. For homeless compared to the general population. Chance lead injuries on the increase also. Ten times higher homicide ten times higher as well. This is a map we've begun mapping these does these this doesn't apology doesn't show the furthest north part of the county- Lancaster is also a hot spot- we're doing some hard going Elsie's we've identified about- twenty communities where- where almost S. are concentrating- and this analysis is part of a- a initiative really that were we've launched here in LA county to try to prevent homeless deaths and doing we're also going to be doing some more fine grained- geo coding of deaths within those hot spots to try to figure out where where they're happening so that we can prevent them. And this is my- the room the recommendations of the lot of these are already being acted on again here in Los Angeles county as part of an effort across our health agency in and other other. Other agencies in our county. One is we're working with the corner to establish a almost death review panel we're learning from similar efforts in New York New York City. To figure out just to take samplings of folks who've died of different causes to understand the- the circumstances better to help prevent. The deaths we're conducting missional a survey research from the homeless population we were care harbor a couple weeks ago and we're doing. We're with the street average teams now collecting information from homeless individuals and from service providers. To get some more insights on reasons. For this- increase in mortality- we're looking into. Also we want to see what the moderates are people have been recently housed because those are that's a that's that's important as well. We want to. With the vision zero folks are looking to reduce traffic fatalities given that this such a- acute problem with a with the homeless in terms of traffic fatalities. We wanna a tailor some strategies there. And that we would just generally want to. Improve and refine our methods for on going monitoring up almost mortality. And that's said that's all I have for today thank you very much. Thank you when you we appreciate the. The presentation I know we're missing a speaker but how about if I jump in the questions from the committee members if there are any everybody the strikes. The Hertzberg comment urgency urgency a couple questions- and in the meantime and- just to be provocative a little bit if. There wasn't Barack or see we didn't have all these regulations etcetera what would you proposes an immediate step. To address- the mortality rate total out the box are a little would you right now. What we're trying to get people house but in the meantime there's still dying before their houses so I would say shelter- temporary shelter in it yeah. On the question because we have our speaker who's right okay with open. And Theresa Winkler high you're here as a- as a testimonial right. Yeah on the on the need to have urgency so we appreciate your time thank you very much. Yeah a of about as a thank you okay is. My name is sherry swindler and I was formally homeless. I've been in- affordable housing now for. Over ten years and by the in an affordable housing I was able to address. Until illness substance abuse and- just the. Chronic pains- the mind body and soul and spirit. I feel that it. There were more shelters and affordable housing. More people would be able to survive. Not only just physically but they will be able to grow. Productively and become better people because I'll. She by giving a person just sat house it's not a home show they don't. They don't want to thrive. But when you're be when they're able to address the issues that they have on hand- medically and mentally. Well to well okay because I the median understand I had mental issues or physical issues in the last ten years have been able to address my mental issues. My health is to improve job 100% because I've be hepatitis C. I have no. I have no longer life changing diseases thank goodness- and when I was homeless for almost twenty five years I wasn't safe I was in my active drug addiction I was. Excuse my language I was process to for over twenty five years and it was a side. Show by the grace and mercy of a loving god. He's sitting here to testify about it you know so I feel that if you had more shelters and more how affordable housing they gave wraparound services. People can thrive and grow. I think that's five minutes. I appreciate your- your presentation I want to take it back to. Q. a please Mister Sawyer. Thank you at and I have my good friend and former state senator- Kevin Murray who who is present executive director CEO of the wind are center in the back and- he mentioned to me it up this term called- service resistant. That no matter how much we put stuff out there. There are individuals. That won't come in no matter how urgent it is no matter how many people down the street no matter how much we can prove that it is not beneficial for them to be on the street. De resistant to that I was glad to see that we're talking about actually talking to homeless people and asking them what will bring the men because I feel sometimes that's a little missing. In this equation. And I want to. I know Mr Murray isn't back there and I don't want to. Take a bottle of time but if you want to comment- where Mr Murray's house I don't know if we he gets. Personal privilege to. I think my- my personal choice. Personal belief on that. Is I noticed said. Within the last couple years there's been more people. Join outreach programs people such as myself going out and talking to people. You know because- the people that go out. I mean I'm able to sit on the curb. And talk to someone who's- suffered or separate and I can connect because I've been there done that and tell them Hey I understand where you're at but check this out it works you just have to you know and then the mental illness cakes jam or man at a win here that go away because I was separate. He said I don't wanna hear that go way get away from me you know but- it's how you approach the people. You know because like I said. Many times before dash we're going to get a lot of people find a lot of chance with a lot of people dying. If we don't get more people that can connect with people you know and not feeling. I don't want to feel like I'm in judge when I'm sleeping in the tent. Okay because you don't know my story can't walk in my shoes you don't know what I have suffered you know and until you do. Judge me. Yeah now I'm and that's how a lot of people that are homeless fail you now in. You judge me there's only one Jack which en I'm- and we all feel like- I'm not judging you she why by the way you look at me the way you talk to me you know and- people feel like that. You know when I go into a store. Yeah I'll tell you this weekend I had some vouchers and they were to go shopping with and I really didn't I was blessed with those vouchers but I didn't need them. And I tried to bless other people with them and the man was like I don't need that. You don't know which might me because one day you can become that person. Show. You gotta watch what you say and how you treat paper treat people the way you want to be treated. Yeah because when you do that your blessings cam. Yeah am blessing I am is a preacher okay as I as I said I suffered twenty five years to prostitution drug addiction drug addiction and the wine garden is awesome I speak here at least two or three times a month and I have a meeting. On Wednesday. Every night every Wednesday night in the cafe. So the way you treat be able is how you'll be treated. Yeah and if you want to solve a problem you have to look at the solution. You know and you can't solve a problem by just pouring. Sugar and salt look the same Xena. Thank you for everything one more the best answer I regret. If you don't mind I want to part my manners here but I. You took my thunder by thinking and thank you for your presentation I was extremely powerful I have to say- I want to thank. Is CEO and president Kevin Marie for Mike our foundation and it will thank you very much for hosting us here and work with us on a couple of dates. And for the- more poorly for the good work it you do here in our neighbor in our neighborhood thank you. And I also want to recognize- supervisor supervisor mark Ridley Thomas who walked in the room so. I know he'll be presenting Mexico. And we may be running just a couple minutes behind so I apologize about that thank you. I want to at. This I'm sorry I Mister Gibson and then. Mid miss Mitchell. A first of all to recess I wanna say thank you very much there's no condemnation. There's no judging here. We want to be able to be at a help. And you know quiet is cap we've all guilty of something so you're twenty five years is experience. That you can share with people and hope for those people become hold as a result of that- one of things I. Want to make mention of and also- will you talked about it. The number of individuals that die on our streets- and I happen to know. Personally and intimately that a number of homeless individuals. Are targeted- to be robbed and also to be murdered. As it because they are homeless and I had a bill we work on that deal to bring it back to the legislature make. Hate crimes against homeless individuals I hate crimes- and that's important because of my experience sleeping on the streets and homes and vigils. Where someone was tend to run about. One to thirty in the morning- I was sleep but my team was up and- he came branch a gun on two occasions- and so we know what happens on the street. But what can you tell us. About the New York bottle. One in terms of best practices. And any of the best practices are actually being implemented here. And in the second piece to the question as well because we are now entering into a cold. Winter the coal mines what are we doing to get individuals off the streets into. Shelters so they will have to experience the coldness. At present the question- because of the yeah we did find that homicide was to have doubled in the past six years among this population- the- we are. Actually have a scheduled- call meeting with the New York folks who do their- their mortality review- next week and so a lot of the lesson learning is going to. Come over the next couple of weeks so I don't have a trellis managed to share yet about what we what we're learning from New York but I but I would. You know double the opportunity to sort of come back the ones we've had those as I have those conversations causes all very fresh- the other questions about whether in about- about season out yet we. We did we get I'm speaking from the data. Side of things we did look at the deaths by season to see if there's any seasonality that was something that that that was brought up only percent of this are there more deaths happening in the winter verses this summer- and- we- didn't. Find any. Anything jumping out it does it doesn't mean that there aren't any weather related deaths it's just that- we need to look deeper into the causes of death- but that's come up several times and it's something that we have. That we now know is important to follow up on in terms of causes of death- the- folks up in the- elevator were particularly concerned gets gets really cold up there- but also gets really hot. There so that's also heat related deaths because of global warming so it's- it's kind of a- double. Double edged sword. But I'm sorry five my follow up. Okay. I'll talk shop by we running behind schedule and the card is to us share. Okay is Mitchell sorry about that it's one make sure on respect for the rest of speaker so don't leave us. Thank you Mister chairman I appreciated- thank you to reset for always being willing to. Bring your truth to bear- you spend a lot of time in Sacramento testified on bills was good to see it on I appreciate you. Continuing to hold us accountable. Dr Nicolas I'm curious about the slide here- because it's clear that there are hot spots indicated by the red and the yellow. And I'm curious if you think- it makes sense because as we know all resources are limited. That there should be targeted if you will for lack of a better term resources and focus on the areas that your data shells are the areas that are in the hot spots where deaths occur at a higher rate than other areas of the county is that. The county strategy. Yes that's that's one of them- and it is yet striking because it's yeah there's a concentration in the core downtown but you've got Long Beach Pomona. Venice Lancaster I mean it's all the corners of the county- and so. Yeah our next step after this is we're gonna this actually it's hard to see this red and orange the sort of the red ones of the- with the most. Deaths happen we're gonna go deeper and see if we can find the intersections where they're happening there state on that as well- yeah anything we can do to. Turn that our goal is to bring the number of homeless debts down you know what at the same time the warehousing people we want to make sure that there's fewer deaths on the street. And again I'm assuming. Estrategias to a yeah dig deeper and focus on. The higher rate absolutely yeah thank you. Rivas reset for being here and for sharing your story- you know the we always remember stories and it really helps- as a legislator I'm to hear directly from someone on that has this experience- I have a question for Dr Nicholas on- the traffic the transportation related deaths you know I've been thinking about this lately because- there was just a van accident in that killed a homeless woman in Pacoima in the San Fernando Valley which is my district. Are we having can't meant on freeways I think it's dangerous and- you dole and I'm working with Caltrans you know on the solution and they do have a process- but I was curious in terms of the this increased like you mentioned that they've doubled- is it both streets and highways or you know what can we do in terms at least their highways at the state level you know that's Caltrans I'm curious what we can do. To prevent those deaths. Yeah will our strategy there is we're fortunate here in LA- that we have a vision zero coalition that's initiative that the city's taken up to reduce- traffic fatalities vertically among pedestrians and cyclists which is over 80% of these. Traffic deaths among looks raising homelessness are among cyclists and pedestrians- they're spread out there's not we didn't find a lot of concentrations of ended they they're probably a line with where the hot spots are that. That they've analyze for part as part of his and zero- we've been asking homeless folks- through our survey effort to get their feedback on whether they think there's- you know. Whether they think that. In a safe zone should be created for. Encampments or- you know more emergency call boxes on streets we sort of throwing out ideas and also asking them for what they they would think would be important for helping to. Helping to reduce these but it's yeah it's striking- again yeah so it's really mostly through this vision zero at adding up up a focus on people experiencing homelessness in the in the vision zero plan is. What we're doing. Remember members room. The committee members- cam and over to the next panel just so we don't lose speakers- but I don't want to shy away from the needs questions we can always refer them over to the other office and have some answers this will be the last hearing either on and so I want to thank you for being here and thank you to reset that was incredibly powerful thank you for your for your work. And Mr Nichols thank you for being here and we're calling up our next panelist this is about Kern initiatives addressing- addressing the urgency homelessness- we have with us on a from the LA county side of the honorable mark Ridley Thomas we all know he's been a champion on this issue- of for a long time and then fill at answer of the director of LA county homelessness initiative. LA city will be joined in the and shortly by honorable Mitchell feral and- Christina Miller who is here deputy mayor for Los Angeles. A city. And the mayor's office I apologize- twenty one thing if my colleagues okay within about strike in the sense of urgency. And I'm not sure my very very quick story I've- I've been listening to some of the podcast you've been on supervisor Ridley Thomas all sure my podcast in front of everybody now. It's really interesting right now and then. I want to thank- commissioner to solve for helping me with this issue- here's what happened me in turn terms of needing a sense of urgency on the show almost as- a few weeks ago- right before the rain started aye aye. Most people know I walk my speedball. Walk my dog amble heights and- talk to the homeless folks and try to get a better understanding and- ends up that. I finally talked to an individual who wanted help and he said yes I want help I want to go I want right now. And we all know how long it takes to get to that point. Here's what happened we called Lhasa and- we call their- we call fo'c'sle there's a Hey we really need help this person he's ready I'm assembly member away here. The it they referred us to a website. To fill out a form and within seventy two hours will dispatch somebody. May we need to have a better sense of urgency than that and that that. It shocked me and then so I did what any person office would you pull rank. And you say well he I represent the area I'm demanding somebody come out here and- the answer was the same. Have you fill out this form. Within seventy two hours will be sending somebody. And that has not left my mind at some of these some of the work that we do including our work a half have a greater sense of urgency that so for that I thank you of your hard work because very few people who have a greater sense of urgency. On this issue than the supervisor thank you very much for your had bird working back and forth on published achieve this thank you forgers. Thank you very much Mr chairman members of the committee and- those who are. Here representing the. Senate we agree to on behalf of the county of Los Angeles. Gen with your permission I'm going to just. Rifled through these remarks- pleased to be here- with so bill and sell who is the- a counties point person on homelessness. Of the county's bench is deep in terms of subject matter experts. On a ride he of disciplines pertaining to. Homelessness say. It's the locus of intersectional work for us but the bill is the of principle person who is all about homelessness mess it would about the public sentiment was in November just a few days ago that the Los Angeles business council released a poll that showed that 95% Of Los Angeles county residents pointed to homelessness is the number one concern. We thought it was intense. All right. On the said lane and I took it too seriously I guess. We thought there was intensity in our polling twenty seventeen- but I just have to say it's more. Intense now. A recent poll by the counties association of. Governments that is sees that how poll and the children 90% of Californians are concerned about homelessness. PP I see. One out of every four Californians believe housing and homelessness was the most important issue facing California today and that number was more sharply appointed to. In Los Angeles county. And in August- I did some focus group works a would six focus so- components. On the county of Los Angeles and they said it was just simply urgent and wanted to see bold action. Brought the work. Of that poll- that focus who worked for the committee's consideration. You heard from public health one of the things that is dramatizing the urgency of the moment Mister chairman and colleagues is this. One every single day in the county of Los Angeles as many as three people die on our streets directly attributable to homelessness twice the homicide rate in this county. Now that doesn't get your attention I don't know what will. It is startling dated it is a triple double to the research done by none other than the county corner chief medical examiner. Of the issues guns water control in this up taking until corner has gotten in. Trying to articulate methodologies as speak to prevention. Bob pulls the question to you one is a corner. Do prevention work. It speaks to the epidemic implications that we are confronted with them. Of the public health ways and says that they have a bigger database and sold these numbers are in that get this understated. So they went deeper and some of that you. Hearing now the average age. Death is you know was- fifty one years among the homeless population against seventy three of the general population you died twenty years early if you homeless. Over an hour. Just a few weeks ago at an entity called care harbored this was- we call this make a free clinic that used to be at the form and then it came to the sports arena knowledge at the reform. We decided that we would dedicate one of the three days. To the homeless population. And so eight hundred homeless individuals were provided direct medical care everything from dental visual mammograms name what the issue might be they got it and they will hold up out through a follow on service with a medical home. The providers participated in this to help them get there and so- this is yet again another way of dramatizing that people to the point of service resistance- it's a missed place debate that we just cut into that. Thirty thousand people today are waiting shelter homes opportunities and so it is not my view that we need to focus on those who may not want to come and just focus on those who want to come in and raise their hands and then we will do our job and do it well- the county is funding intensive case management services for. Formerly homeless tenants. And all of news. From the supportive housing including triple H. funded projects self bill we'll talk more about that- we are engaged in. A range of- efforts as many of you know a hundred and twenty five million operate in drum housing and shelter sites. We do that in the unincorporated areas. And just from January of the twenty eighteen to now. Almost three thousand new and from housing bids and individuals plus four hundred and drum housing units just in the largely unincorporated areas of Los Angeles county seventeen to shelters. On the way- that means another thirteen hundred people and yet. I would just scratching the surface. This isn't cutting it. Much much more has to be done. Couple weeks we'll do something called safe landing- but I didn't of fifteenth in Normandy and twenty four seven access- to outreach teams to bring single individuals inside and receive clinically and had services this is going to be bridge housing on steroids. And we need to do more than on the ground breaking will happen. But low buildings these are the innovations we have to do to get these buildings up more quickly can happen in four to five months. On at significant cost savings. And so I just want to say that. Urgency is the order of the day I've said that we need nothing short. Of a state of emergency some reacted to that and said well. We don't know if we do that that sounds like an open checkbook to me well if you don't want a state of emergency then develop a comprehensive crisis response strategy. Get busy. That's what we have to do that the executive branch the legislative branch nothing else will satisfy this issue in the county of Los Angeles the epicenter of homelessness in the state we because of measure H. but able to take as many as one hundred and thirty people off the streets out of almost every single day. Only to be met with a hundred and fifty. That fall into homelessness we are losing ground as we speak. And that's after we put in an additional three hundred fifty five million every year that's on couple we were already investing. And so it is in part a question of resources but is not exclusively a question of resources I believe where there's a will there's a way where this money going to come from Ridley Thomas well I think. There are several ideas and play currently Mister chairman and colleagues of the issue is simply this. Of the prop sixty three resources. An SSH a we need to re think the deployment of those resources. And any county in the state of California who stopped falling resources today ought to be called for. And have to deal with it accordingly I start with the county of Los Angeles. There is no reason for us to do anything other than to eat that doubly prudently strategically deploy these resources so that we can deal with. Lightly by the people who are yet homeless now not everyone agrees with that. But that's okay I'm prepared to repeated. The governor's desk three things of this task force and that is to N. street homelessness one and to break down the barriers to build more housing is the second point. And to get more people into treatment is the third point the street that's three simple things that we can get to those things we will have earned our titles as being. Honorable I'll conclude with the examples that I think can be made the real one would think about a comprehensive crisis response. Versus to extend statewide and broaden the authority of A. B. eleven ninety seven shot up to the chair will that work. Shuttle to the city of Los Angeles for collaborating with the chair in that pursuit to needy statewide Siegel relief is important. Then think we need to continue to examine a refined- the interpretation of grade disability press on to- LPS. It seems to me that to construct elaborate arguments that justified people literally- expiring on our streets and their own feces and Bob this is hugely problematic. We can do better than that and we ought to many new that LPS was over extended. At least forty years ago one of its own authors said ten years and we perhaps went too far far we need to dial this back it is critical that we look at that seriously. I want to suggest that we need to capitalize on existing public policy of publicly owned properties and assets- right here on Skid Row state owns property of the city owns property county owns property us get role is indefensible in the day of the week and we are not accept these conditions but I refuse to believe that we have to. I just refuse to believe that I think changes can be brought to bear Mister chairman and I know that you and your colleagues share that. Point of view. Our we are released my phone at this point. I do want to punctuate the point that urgency is of critical nature I did want to show to the findings of the focus group work that- were done. Are just a. Few weeks ago- creating safe leaving sites another shelter type facility was number one. For those who were in these groups. Freezing rent levels statewide was another point. Providing incentives to landlords to rent to those experiencing homelessness and reducing discrimination against low income renters was a third point. Museum publicly and privately owned lands and buildings. Became important for these groups on the use of groups that were interesting in terms of- Latinos- and someone monolingual Latinos others African Americans- angles. Disciplines from multi ethnic groups so there was six different focus groups and finally- A. B. group- and so we looked at this because he wanted to be in for. And our advocacy. And I take away from this and all the other polling and focus group work. To underscore the issue of urgency. A comprehensive crisis response strategy doesn't that mean that we have to have a right to housing- right to write to the war right to shelter and when we began this where we thought affordable housing which is an aspirational objectives that we still maintain was what we should focus on now we have to deal with short term solutions. We cannot allow people to stay on the streets if it takes three to four years to build affordable housing that's wait too long to tolerate we need to deal with the immediacy of the moment I thank you Mister chair. And colleagues. Supervisor chancellor. Good morning the honorable members I'm finance on the director Los Angeles county homeless initiative and I appreciate the opportunity. To speak with you today. Through their carried through their board of supervisors leadership in launching the homeless initiative in August of two thousand fifteen. And accept the responsibility that is fragmented among government entities stepping up and saying that the county would assume that role of county wide leadership. We've been able to make meaningful progress. As a coordinated county wide system we're doing more today than ever before in helping thousands as- homeless families youth and individuals move into permanent housing. In calendar year two thousand eighteen alone the homeless service delivery system directly helped over twenty one thousand family members individuals move from homelessness into permanent housing which is double the number who are helping to permanent housing before the homeless initiative was launched. And we provide aid I'm outreach services and prevention to triple the number of people who were Sir before the homeless initiative and measure H. measure age was approved by Los Angeles county voters in March of two thousand seventeen take effect in October twenty seventeen. With the board's concurrence we began providing expanded services supported by measure H. three months before the tactic of fact precisely because of the urgency of this crisis. And in the twenty one minds from July two thousand seventeen. Through September of two thousand nineteen. Measure H. enabled seventeen thousand eight hundred and five homeless family members and individuals to move into permanent housing and an additional thirty five thousand family members individuals moved into an arm has seen during that same period of time in arm housing founded in whole. Or in part by measure H. so these are extraordinary numbers of people moving. Office aids in tener housing and into permanent housing and yet at the same time the crisis is worse. As we all know from January two thousand eighteen to January two thousand nineteen. The increase in Los Angeles county homeless population was 12% That was less than any other urban area in California by a lot and still completely unacceptable absent measure H. it would have been that much worse. A supervisor Lee Thomas noted in each on the average day of two thousand eighteen one hundred and thirty three people every day exited homelessness in Los Angeles county through a combination of the work at home the service delivery system. And the resilience and resources of people experiencing homelessness who got back into permanent housing on their own but on that same average day a hundred and fifty people became homeless in Los Angeles county primarily because of the combination. Of skyrocketing rents I'm jazzed evictions and a severe lack. Of affordable housing. We are working to gather in an extraordinary movement that is brought together hundreds of organizations and literally tens of thousands of people's across government. Community providers business and faith organizations. In a scale that we have never seen before. To help people move out of homelessness we are bailing water out of this boat faster than ever before but the hole in the bottom of the boat is so large that we are at risk of this boat sinking and the total number of our neighbors who are homeless on the streets. Continues to grow. So we have double down continuing to execute these comprehensive strategies which are having a historic level of success in moving people from homelessness into permanent housing and at the same time we continue to implement. Innovative new solutions I want to underscore that there are thirty thousand people that are homeless in Los Angeles county. They have been a stashed and you want to move into permanent housing. And the most immediate bear your turn their ability to do that is funding for rental subsidies. It's much faster. J. provide funding for rental subsidies then it is to build a new inner housing facility and it's cheaper to we can provide permanent housing not build it. By provide rental subsidies India current rental housing. More quickly and more cheaply that is the fastest solution to this crisis. Some of the specific actions innovative actions that are under way include reducing the number of call county clients who become homeless by leveraging our mainstream systems social services child welfare probation health and mental health. The board of supervisors has adopted the first permanent rent stabilized ation ordinance in the unincorporated areas if any county in the country and in California and are incorporated areas if they were city would be the second largest city in Los Angeles county with over million residents. The words approved fining for new eviction defense program for low income tenants in certain targeted zip codes I'm working and we are working collaboratively with the city of Los Angeles it is funny is similar program to implement a seamless program. In those targeted zip codes we're expanding the use of shared housing. Both as a response to the cost of housing and the lack of supply to enable more people to move from homelessness into permanent housing. We're expanding safe parking and mobile showers and exploring the establishment of safe sleep sites to respond to the immediate needs of people were sleeping in encampments. And on our streets. We're building more interim and permanent supportive housing and we have more in terms has seen and permits supportive housing in the pipeline in Los Angeles county than ever before over six thousand units of permanent supportive housing are scheduled to come on line in Los Angeles county. In the next three years as the supervisor mentioned we will use measure H. to find intensive case management services in all of those units and in those next three years those will largely be units in the city of Los Angeles. Constructed through proposition triple H. we're taking advantage Mister chairman and AB two ten legislation which you carried in two thousand seventeen sponsored by the county of Los Angeles. Where we are Gen we are now implementing a new cutting edge technological solution which will enable outreach workers in case managers relying on that authority granted by the legislature and the governor. To look at a person and determine wider their current services and what have there been there passed services from the homeless services status system and for mainstream county departments these are outreach workers on the sidewalk talking to people experiencing homelessness. And finally in terms of these innovative actions I want to note that we're working very closely with the cities across Los Angeles county not only Los Angeles city but the eighty seven smaller cities as well. Forty cities in the county that are home 295% of the county homeless population that resides in cities. Have developed their own homelessness plans find it by the county and we're now finding those cities and their councils of governments to support implementation of those homelessness plans cities in the county have moved from saying it's not our problem. To saying how can we help. And with all yet with all of this work we cannot do this by ourselves with all the resources I'm press and resources provided by measure H. we cannot as local government. Solve this crisis ourselves any in particular we need your continued help from the state. How from the state to protect tenants from being displaced. To increase the supply of housing and to provide additional funding. Fining particularly for rental subsidies as I mentioned. And to keep assisted living facilities open. We greatly appreciate the work of the legislature and the governor last year in particular the enactment of AB fourteen eighty to. Enactment of SB three twenty nine authored by senator Mitchell and sponsored by the county and funding for the homeless housing assistance and prevention program. But as we move forward into twenty twenty. We very much need your assistance and continuing to work together to secure additional state funding and policy changes which will enable us to both reduce the number of families and adults who are falling into homelessness. And to help families and adults were already homeless moving to permanent housing. One eight just reinforces supervisors comment about urgency and about our commitment there were many of that as- I'm in this system including myself who spent thanksgiving weekend ensuring that we would have emergency shelters open. Ahead of schedule. For people who are on the streets during last week's storms. That exemplifies our commitment to responding urgently to bring our homeless neighbor's home I did reduce the flow of people and almost as and with it forward. Add to continuing to work with you in this critical effort thank you. Thank you and I want to apologize everybody's about fifteen minutes behind trying to keep it as close as we can- and with that gentle reminders to keep within five minutes all state over. A couple times thank you. Councilmember fail if you'd be on. Okay fund. Thank you Mister chair and- honorable members of the state Senate and state assembly thanks for having me here today I'm very very pleased to say a few words and answer as many questions as you all might have I'm gonna give you a little bit of a progress report on the production of HHH. Under the backdrop of. The fact that the state of California has one third of the U. S. homeless population. The state of California has one third of the U. S. homeless population. The county of Los Angeles has one half of the state's homeless population just to give you. A sense of the gravity of and magnitude of this crises. Up under that backdrop- in twenty sixteen just three years ago. Of voters in the city of Los Angeles approved measure HHH in an overwhelming. Majority of the vote. And out of whole cloth three years later we have the ten thousand units. Are in the pipeline- funded under construction- with about two thousand of those units set to open within twelve months one calendar year. Do following on the heels of HHH in November of twenty sixteen. Measure H. passes you know in in the spring. Of providing the services- the wraparound services that are needed- at all of these permits for of housing sites temporary bridge shelter whatever it may be. A funded by the county and it was Los Angeles city voters that put H. over the top to make sure that it would be successful and pass. Los Angeles voters a Los Angeles residents have known for a long time. That it'll have to be all hands on deck to really make a dent in this homelessness crises that we find ourselves in- that it was built up over a number of decades and not years or months- but none the less here's what we have- I think as Mr and Salas just mention. We have an unprecedented level of collaboration and cooperation Anna in addressing this crises between of various government agencies county and city. Of Los Angeles was the very first city in the state of California. To create a funds to address homelessness I and so I'm very proud of that fact and then. Some other cities have followed since that time we know that Sacramento- has- taken action as has San Francisco and on the ballot coming up- initiatives in in the spring or San Jose and Oakland. So cities across the state large cities are starting to recognize that. In order to get control of this double digit increase in homelessness your- after year. They're also gonna have to have skin in the game at the local level. I think that it's very very clear with what we're up against we know that ten thousand units in the city of Los Angeles or not going to house the thirty six thousand. I individuals who are on sheltered and on housing- in the city of Los Angeles we want to keep this production going somehow some way. Now I mentioned that we created this. Acesse out of whole cloth just three years later we have. Of these- these facts to it too but I think- be very proud of- however we need much much more- is so. I've gone to Sacramento a couple of times will be there again next month working very closely with our mayor and you're about to hear from Cristina Miller it. On what we feel makes sense for a- a bill. Off from the state legislature and approved by the governor. Where in we can keep these resources going- so that we can keep the production going of services. Bridge home shelters and permanent supportive housing. The one thing that we always lack and I just heard mentioned. Thirty thousand individuals are homeless right now have are willing to accept Abed but we do not have the inventory. As the chair of the homelessness and poverty committee on that lawcenter city council. My main goal is to produce inventory so we can get people under a roof without that we cannot affected fully. Even talk about ending homelessness we have to have the inventory to do that first we have a whole range of other issues to deal with we know that in in in closing we know that. When the LA times and other educational institutions did some deep digging into the Los account from earlier this year- it was discovered- there right in the numbers that the majority of folks affected by homelessness have mental health issues or drug addiction issues. We have to address that at the local and state level along with the production of this inventory of beds that I'm talking about I and- we look forward to working with all of use the state and the assembly on helping to craft a bill for the entire state- but let me just say one. Has a minor one more time the county of Los Angeles has half of the state's homeless population who wanna make sure that the resources that we identify- did take into consideration. That fact and that the funding is commensurate with the need- and I think that our friends and allies up and down the state will understand that because homelessness is everywhere. In the state of California as never before again thank you for your time and I'm happy to answer questions. Amir deputy. And good morning has deemed committee members my name is Christina Miller deputy mayor of city homelessness initiatives I thank you for the opportunity and privilege to testify at before you on the city's current efforts under America studies leadership I also want to thank the state for the two rounds of the- state. Block grants heap at which is the grants at the city received in twenty eighteen. At the city has committed nearly is far ahead of schedule at the deadline to commit. 50% of those funds out was January is January twenty twenty so the city is- had a schedule and making sure that we get those funds out the door. And since we are on Skid Row and now I've mention heat I do also want to posit- and lift up. The passage of a recent program that is he funded at that will target and black women who are vulnerable living on the streets of Skid Row. As a one point five million dollar program in which we will target outreach to vulnerable women who are living on the streets. And triage them to permit housing as quickly as we can another part of that program is to. Provide cultural competency training to service providers to make sure we can at see what learning some of can be scaled I'm in this program that want to look that up it seemed appropriate and give the location of this hearing. And again also I think the state for the hap grant and these grants are critical for expanding the impact of our local strategies we cannot do this work without you. And be very sure what the Ste the city strategies look like I do want to underscore and the story that fill shared about what was what we are able to accomplish last week. He gave me a sense of hope I'm in the speed by which the city in the county of Lhasa were able to work together. And as many of us were you know settling in for the holiday to be inside in the warm and eva family and celebrate what we're grateful for. The reality was very different for people living on the streets of Los Angeles they were faced with a very cold winter storm. And with really few options in terms of where to go our winter shelter program does not begin until December first- and so it was with a nimble nest and flexibility that I don't think I've ever seen. The city in casting worked together to open up. Over eleven hundred need shelter. For bad. To make sure that we can provide options for people who were vulnerable and second who needed to come inside. With the bad weather coming. On this required. Activating reckon parks facilities that were never meant to be winter shelters we had city staff on on call twenty four hours a day. The American red cross stepped up. And loss that was that was that you know a major player their- volunteers recall from the everyone in efforts okay. It really did kind of run you a sense of hope for me anyway that and what we can achieve if we do all work together and look at. This as the crisis that is. I'm but in the limited time that I have- I would like to share some of the work the city's focused on. Our current home this budget is four eight six two million dollars. This is twenty five times of the homelessness budget. Was just four years ago and two thirds of which- have been set aside for permanent housing with our triple H. program. And the mers primary areas of focus for street our streets strategies and tackling and shelter homelessness. Interim housing affordable housing development and preservation. At a place bass strategy in Skid Row. For street strategies the mayor has set up the unified homelessness response center. This is the physical space the coal locate vital for the leadership. Is a Central Command post to coordinate the deployment of resources that interface of people living on sheltered. This sounds like something the city would have had before right but was just establish just last year. And we to playing early eighteen hundred operations per month that entail integration of. Services an outreach with sanitation resources to focus on delivering outreach services. But also to manage- cleanliness and public spaces. Be unified with this response center is the command post also coordinates operations during emergencies. AB most recently with the fires and again with that the heavy rains. And the next phase is to make v√¨ you HRC a twenty four hour center. Our right now it has normal business hours but we know those are not the hours that homelessness keeps. They do not at people living on the streets do not keep bankers hours we need to have resources twenty four hours a day. For intermountain the mers a bridge home program which was in. Eighteen months ago has five hundred nineteen new beds a bridge housing opens a date. And a total of twenty four hundred new shelter beds total in the pipeline that is thirty separate shelters that we are- hoping to have open by June. Twenty twenty- I'll just underscore this is the largest capital program shelter program that is as the launched in the country. There's no playbook with how you stand up thirty shelters- within the course of under two years. So we are we are blazing the trail here. Am I also invite everyone to visit the mers website at Ellie mayor you want to track the progress of those different Bridgetown shelters. I'm also during his time in office the mayor's work diligently with counsel partners and others to pass. The affordable the affordable housing linkage be transit oriented community programs. Triple H. at triple H. housing challenge- which is on its way to produce over ten thousand units- of affordable housing of which eight hundred thousand will be supportive housing. We have our first opening at the end of this month. Fingers crossed god help us we want to make sure we get that first project open in the calendar year twenty nineteen- there's also strengthened the rent stabilization ordinance. Has reached a goal of permitting one thousand one hundred thousand units. Of a housing two years ahead of schedule. And in fact in July of this year LA city was responsible for permitting 25% of all the housing units in the entire state. And we are 10% of the population. We are tremendous road ahead of us in tackling the homelessness crisis. There is no doubt AB the amount of groundwork laid over the last three years has been astounding. And I say this as someone who worked in the field for a dozen years first as a service provider. On the ground serving people who were and sheltered- and it is pretty tremendous what we've been able to at least the groundwork. Growing an ongoing partnership with the state and identifying the much needed resources to truly move the needle and bring people indoors thank you. Thank you and then I wanna I know- the supervisor I one last thing to say and I'm a handed over to questions Q. and I'm I'm gonna go over to miss Mitchell in and Mr Hertzberg. In Gipson. Supervisor of thank you very much was German just of a quick couple of remarks response your opening comments about of the issue of- blossom and it's. On responsiveness to your- request. Clearly homelessness is a heavy heavy lift. I want to say that it's the case that- loss of will be going through a transition and- presumed restructuring all this is a matter of public record- and I welcome it- a lot of work has been done over the past five years- but more work needs to be done- better work smarter work work defined by more activation and agility- I don't think so we were at a- adequately prepared for what we are contending with. And so the amount praise that we may elect to heap upon ourselves is not squaring with voters- the polling that we shared- in each instance right there is a pretty heavy dissatisfaction rate with what has been done- with- the city's measures some measure and with the counties much I think we need to speak candidly about this in such a way that we know we have to do a lot. More a lot more. We need to assess and real time where we are chairman. And scale up our capacity aye innovations are. Flexibility we've got to do some things in a different way now the county has to take responsibility for its piece of that puzzle. One Lhasa was first started the county had to be brought screaming and kicking the table to address homelessness forty years ago. Is now the case of the county funds loss at 70% of its budget. through- measure age and additional related. Expenditures so accountability is the order of the day of the state has made its way to Los Angeles and the significant manner. A hundred and eighteen thousand in terms of app dollars projected. Of for this year sixty five million. For the county hundred and eighteen for the city sixty five for. De. County sixty seven for loss of there's a distribution of resources here the speak to accountability and so while we all want to say what we are doing I wish to say we have to do a lot more and the people of this region expect no less. We are obliged to. Thank you Mister thank you with that- miss Mitchell Mister Hertzberg and Mister Gipson. Thank you very much chairman thank you all for coming today. And thank goodness for H. HHH and he- I tried that goes without saying. But you know well as I've been a lot of time thinking about this you know the reality is that what we are experiencing what the whole meal like times. Indicated is the result of what I would cut call a slow boil. We didn't give your overnight. And I am reminded of my ten years in the legislature Mr and sale coming diligently the fact real every year. Bringing me a chart that I would hang on my front door. That show over time the state's- lack of investment in cal works the years that we cut the cal works grant. And a direct correlation to the number of cal works families that were in three homelessness. For ten years every year would see that chart out hang on the front door as a reminder. And so what I want to talk about or or or really polls is. Given our collective agreement on the sense of urgency today how are we going to sustain our investment over time. Because during tough economic times for government. Is when the citizenry in our residents need government the mouth. So during that ten year recession when the state couldn't pass a budget on time- because member folks are fighting for these services and they were forced with the two thirds requirement to cut investments that was the from the beginning of the flow of oil. That we're experiencing today. And so how do we all levels of government the collective commitment. Because while the LA L. has in the part of finance have stated that for this next year we look release pretty thought the general fund we all know the pendulum will swing. So how do we all hold hands. Calls our nose in job and make the promise that we won't do what. Government tends to do. Such a government economic times we cut services people need the most when they're broke and government's broke too. This is a slow boil so how do we not. Continue to take full advantage of this moment in time investment by not making a commitment to sustain it over time. I'll just quickly all say it's a matter of leadership. If we didn't have the governor we have now. In good times we wouldn't be making the decisions that we are making of the previous governor refused to recognize this crisis. And to the extent that that is the case exactly and his predecessors predecessor and so it has been- also a conspicuous absence. Of leadership and engagement on this crisis now this is not to say and a whole so matter they did nothing of value as a governor's of the state of California but on this question- they were. Significantly absent on from their post and it is compounded the crisis in this state from that assertion I will not retreat. And nor would I stand up beside you I just think you know it's important for us to acknowledge that there were decisions made by elected bodies that we all currently serve on- that that that lit the fire a slow boil the fact eight voucher holders couldn't find a place to you about your- is it. Is a crime the in the early two thousands we cut the cal works grant- to historic lows in my opinion is a crime and sold a my point is. You know. The buildings Aug grand opening sexy I get that and those are important to do but there's other work that we have to do to make sure that we are making sure that the least among us continue to have resources to be able to afford the rent whatever the right level. Is that we are continuing to fully utilize it'll federal dollars the fact you know the section Davis friendly funded we have to make sure that people can use the voucher particular here in LA county when you wait ten years to get it- and so I just want us to think. Broadly in creatively about how we are allies on this moment in time on the public's. Focus in interest and make sure that it's stained over time that we don't continue this Evan flow of investment divestment- that that compromises. Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a really that I thank you. Eight dollars need to be revisited I think general at the state level. And at the county level I think G. R. dollars needs to be revisited and re distributed you can start there but what we have. And if we could. Do what government does it do. Which is the to think creatively about our silo funding you know I'm hoping that the state is going to be successful in their eleven fifteen wager application. To look at the whole person. And to look at how we can perhaps use Medicaid dollars the fund people who are medically fragile living on the street so we can begin to address. Those red and yellow areas so thinking creatively general fund dollars to prop sixty three dollars how do we make that the dollars fit the need today. I think it's an important thing to do. And if I may senator Mitchell just a quick response I think a slow boil is the perfect description. For what we find ourselves in right now. And just let me tell you I couldn't care less about sexy grand openings I'd rather not even have them at all. We just need to get people under our roof and that is my focus. But at at I just want to say that. Nguyen polling comes out the shows 95% of Angelinos at the top concern is homelessness. I think we could all be involved in incorporated included in that polling does it makes elected officials nervous so what I think we need to do is. We have to stay the course and make adjustments along the way. We just talked about- collectively the successes we're making I am not going to second guess public perception. I respected I get it I understand it. Up Bob. As leaders we also have to make sure that what we know we're succeeding in. We stick with. That what we know we need to tighten up a re visit or retool we also do that. Along the way. Because I feel that in a year's time when we have two thousand new units of opening up and- people experiencing homelessness actually moving and getting house. Long term indefinitely. That public perception will slowly begin to change. But I'm not sitting here concerned with public perception right now. I I'm concerned with achieving the will. Voter from to have three years ago. And the concern of majority eventually knows how to get ready. Under D√¢n of have I respect that. A long term what we need to do in this window where we are experiencing surplus is at the St Paul. Is we have to address some of the fundamentals that we we've always ignored as well. I'm sure of a committee call homelessness and poverty we held a poverty summit for the very first time. In the city's history in September. We are going to take a look and we're we're expecting a report from that summit was extremely well attended it was a great. Yeah elle wonderful day long event with all of the folks the knowledge base of the lived experience. Of the experiences of non profits and leaders in this industry we're expecting a report I want to turn that into city policy. We know where the pockets of poverty always have been we also know that we always neglected to address that. So we need to focus it is to be an all in focus. Eviction prevention- I've more vouchers so that we can get people in the housing keep people house and build. It's an all in approach let me jump ahead just so everybody gets that ask some questions. I want Mister Mister Hertzberg Mister Gibson and then I could also please. Thank. Thank you or contact with several the- road to urgency in my judgment. Is government owned land. The testimony here today was there's thirty thousand folks that are willing to step to take apart take housing we have is Mr Murray suggested service resistant let's focus on the near term deliverable. Why government owned land one we're dealing with the big issue affordability we live in a part of the country where things are quite expensive. If government can can lease the land for a dollar a year deals with reducing rents reducing costs to taxpayers in affordability. So second. In the budget trailer bill SB was at one on one and German I think. Is the idea that we expedited the process for these- navigation centers in terms of security you certainly what we've done with respect Mister Santiago spill. So we have informed government policy informed approach that is are less expensive- critically affordability is a big issue. And certainly the government policy at the state level the speed to market to get this stuff built as fast as possible or whatever the issues if you know how we approach it. We know from the work that we've done with the city of Los Angeles through the city administrative officer the city owns born twenty eight partials. We don't know what the school district has because we've been trying to get it we haven't figured out we all of our two thousand less students we know have some projects we just visitors from the been quite successful with respect to the- districts. Don't know what the county has in the stories that I've heard with rate to innovation is maybe something's missed supervisor talk about but some folks in the San Fernando Valley pay and three and four thousand dollars to the county for. County property is rent with it should be a dollar because it's government owned land which taught follow up on that I probably don't know about that. But but the idea is that they should focus. Of my office. Physically with the operation three thousand one. Forty portions of government land in the San Fernando Valley we've identified a number for the Ste for the for the that the state owns. And we know that the governor was supposed to come up with an emergency reported don't know on September with respect to their- looking at state property. The bottom line is that we a flexibility. We have league we've already demonstrated that legally through the actions of the budget chair. And the governor- we certainly can do this and so my only suggestion is and what I last both the city and the county that are here today. Is what are you doing in that regard. To take advantage of these extraordinary opportunities to be able to. Get folks off the street. And get greater opportunity quickly to make this happen I know that when you came to our meeting at the LA county- delegation talked about some ideas of using parks with respect each districts- and the like. But it I just think that that if we could. We have to show action. The fact that in favor of fair that this has been a slow boil. Fair that that the rate is was just express. Of people coming in is greater. Get a life big deal our jobs to figure it out and fix it next case. So you know to me he- I'd like to hear some insights with respect to both the city. And the county as it relates to those policies what efforts you're engaged in that regard. Okay. Have a quick closing towards in and I know I know Christina Miller has to leave now represent the mayor so thank you very much for participation thank you thank you very much yeah I can just quickly speak to some of the work the city is doing on leveraging public publicly owned land because you're right there is cost savings there that can bring down the cost of development that is that is critical at fifty parcels of those surplus parcels senator that you mentioned in the city were put out to bid as part of our triple H. program so developers were able to leverage the cost of the valued land. I'm in the city and you know provided it for development with a ninety nine year ground lease. And at and with. And. I the bill will not I don't yeah I'm good radios with. I used to you did manage. Yeah yeah I'm also to share with the average I'm program two thirds of those AB projects are on a publicly owned land as well I'm including Caltrans and metro land and city owned parking lots that were identified as good for parcels for that use so could agree more I think in the governor's report and that is either forthcoming or that has already been released it there is minimal state surplus property that's been identified in LA city I think it's something around two properties unfortunately I'm- but we always while twenty one in the county to in the city. I think we ended cut that coincide with opportunities. We always welcome any other you know public entities that are willing to leverage their land for I'm homeless housing and shelter or programming we are completely open to that idea. So think thank you very much thank you very much I'm handed over to Mister Gibson just. A sailor let's. A brief it up and then a- Mister nozzle because we still got one panel sure and I appreciate- although spoken thus far- I went think. I want to say that I actually did the bill that allow the- city of Los Angeles and the San Jose to. Have up to ten. Parcel of land to Caltrans in the governor brown signed as was the Los andjelkovic rents property- that you can build on for one dollar. A year for housing transitional- purposes- with everything is being said I am convinced we have a state of emergency. And it will work clear coat that point and I want to for the- purpose of the senators- we have significant amount of money. In our rating day fund. That all that we have to clear state of emergency in order to access it. That money is used for a state of emergency because as senator Mitchell indicating the pendulum will swing both ways or maybe robust right now. Right who's to say what will happen in the next couple years and I'm strongly suggesting. That we use some of the money- that we have in our rainy day fund to address the emergency that's in front of us. And so I want to be able to get begin to at least have a conversation my colleagues. About the possibilities of that and also looking at other- as senator Hertzberg indicated- government owned property because I think that's the best way to go. To address some immediate needs right now- in addition to that I'm going to conclude on this note- chair Santiago that I think that we need to also look at how do we one be able to. Gets and deal with the sequel- that is causing what I'm hearing- developers who have the option to develop but is being backlog or delayed- three years we don't have three years away first step to be built. We need it to be built right now with the a greater sense of urgency and so that's my comments and I'll conclude on that note. Yes thank you Mister Gibson. I don't need a thank you everybody I don't need of a full response to this but if there's information that can be shared with us on the issue of mental health services- that was not addressed- earlier when a- on the whole range of the deaths and the causes of death and the intersection of mental health illness with- the deaths. That are current on our streets so. Somewhere how does the issue of mental health services- get. It should be given. The priority that it deserves but I don't know I don't have the information. It's just sort of instinct it mental health issues keep coming up on the state level- by many organizations throughout the state especially our younger- men and women and our children are used- the suicide- issues- it's shocking to think that in our state this would be a gross an area of growth in our in our community so. You know if there is information that helps inform us. A one and that we do everything that we can do continue mental health services in fact increase mental health services and that that not be sacrificed. For the issue of housing- I think that's a really important issue were a have a situation and are my own district right now on that but we shouldn't have one or the other we shouldn't sacrifice one or the other we need a we need both so that's that's one. And second is as I mentioned earlier the issue of economic development is so important here we will move our sisters and brothers to the point of getting a job. Because that's the only way they're going to sustain themselves and we as government should not think that forever now up return IT we're going to have to do the subsidies to keep families of float that's not the way our economy should function so I think we also need to make the connection LA was the first- make the city in the country to pass a living wage ordinance. We don't have issues of living wages come up in this con and that's really the is a major issue to keep families from becoming homeless so. With a lot of connecting of the dots but if we don't we and the solving a problem here and it's getting worse over here. Just comments. Just a brief word in terms of the mental health work. Of the state of the art activity that's going on in that area is behavioral health centers. That what's the it was the original Martin at the king hospital five hundred thousand square feet. Is now going to be a state of the art. Behavioral health center. Loading and- best practices and mental health. Of the notion of mental health urgent centers much smaller- facilities the issue of the kindred issue of. Addictive services cold current disorder is a lot of that's going on- senator be glad to provide you with as much information as- the county has. Of the director is John Sharon I think he's to be here a little later- he's fully capable and that but- offices at your disposal to provide you with much information. Would talk about a restorative village- at LA see USC Medical Center souls a lot going on in terms of. Stated the are the county. Is seen as a leading the way in the state among all county the county of Los Angeles. And yet I want to re assert we have a lot of work. To do- miss job we should the opportunity to be here and- speak to the- panel and certainly want to continue this dialogue and will use it to the appropriate. Short now I want to thank you for being here I want to thank you you too dumb as well for being here. And as public servants no the press that a incredibly pressing on your time to. Dedicate an entire morning to it but but I know that use the same words to see if we do. And. You know that for my call one wrapped up to the next. But when I say something that Mister- feral had mentioned and I think. I appreciate the Paula came out because it what we already knew. Your past. And they're angry and they're frustrated about about the homeless a situation and if they haven't lost confidence or losing it very very very quickly. I think it's fair to say look I'm passed. I mean there's a person in this room. Was an upset frustrated- but again I want to thank also that we're not in an exercise a finger pointing I think we've come to the conclusion that. That bigger points on could help right I mean it's not going to solve anything it sexy it. But you know blow the whistle you get a quick press said. The world workers in challenging challenging each other to. To break down obstacles to get this- the get this is this humanitarian crisis under control I think it's fair to say we can call it a public health crisis has been denied- you because they have to be- has to be taken a look at like a public health crisis. It is a state of emergency. It in and I'll tell you I think it's one that that needs to be. Attacked in a compassionate way so when I say that that I'm angry. It comes from a sense of compassion because we have now we've got to figure out how to do this if the least among us doesn't have. A roof over their head food in their mouth- away to care for their kids and we've we've certainly failed society. And animal and a multiple ways. Look I we put together a list of what the state has done. And it's expensive and the reason I put this list together- our folks put together one of the governor's office it is it is. To make that point that had been made by- many of you there- that we've got to figure out a way to blow up the system and start a love in a way that actually addresses- the very contact points that help people. Because we keep throwing money at this problem. And at some point time we got to figure out the most effective use of those dollars. And all point that this and I know miss Mitchell knows this inside and now. But when you take a look at some of the dollars that a bit that we keep putting at this. It's the and at the state level we can go from emergency. Solutions grant and you guys should all have it in your in your- in your notebook and we'll take a look at. A sixty two million this year the housing and homeless prevention- seventy. Three hundred and seventy million was appropriate two hundred and seventy million left. No place like home- we got about two billion coming down the pipeline. Cal words that sound like I'm reading your report right- hundred and- twenty four million last year what this year- the multi family. Housing I mean go on and on it's a two hundred seventy seven million. The. Five million to address homelessness within the act of two thousand eighteen out five hundred million. Five hundred million it's this year at six hundred and fifty million. And I go on and on and on and the millions and millions of we start adding it up. I've been added it up but for somebody. But my guess is by about four to five billion at the state stone in over the last couple of years in one. Way or the other. But you know it's also daunting is if we don't keep drumming that beat we're not going to create that sort of excitement as sort of- fury to get this stuff done out. Of talking my colleague earlier. But three years ago. Our caucus took a poll of what more the most important issues. It was a scientific poll which is kind of. You know we all got to stick as we one put up. I think of like maybe one third of. The members in that room at. Thought that homelessness is even an important problem. One third while some of us were put in both of our stickers on that and- try to steal someone else's sticker to make it. To make it more of an important issue but that's the kind of work we got ahead of us number one it's- it's convincing on. A convincing. Everybody around as a we got a knock down all those beers even if it's painful to ourselves I want to thank you- to da. Are you done in there and other the mayor's office to Cristina for helping us to. Try to figure that out I think next year- have will be. Taken out that sledgehammer knocking down those obstacles. To ensure that that people are house- with with. With some sort of dignity and that mental health care issues- are beginning to. Their trust in a more more much more aggressive- manner and that substance abuse issues is. At the top burner so thank you very much I. And I'm gonna go to our next panel so I want to. It Mister. Mister chair. If I may. This could only in the interest of the other panelists I wanna make sure that they're not going to leave us. But all deferred it to ms Rivas. It's gonna make a brief comment. Of you know I'm looking at our state investments and thank you to the chairman. For summarizing this but I think. At what I see at the state level we don't have a department. Or a state agency that has oversight right there or side load or different agencies and- I think it's time for. The department on homelessness at the state level right. To coordinate all of these. Are programs- and- and for there to be oversight accountability and strategy with working with local governments- so. I just wanted to get one and this is just to remind us all you know the state does have- it was a model we lifted from Utah. On introduced a bill several years ago the state does not have a- homeless coordinating council which because if they had nothing. So at least now we have a coordinating council. Because another critical issue is holding state department heads accountable. For figuring out what role they play Caltrans director is a perfect example in solving this issue. In addition to. Looking at you know already allocated funds that could be directed in this area so while we don't have a state department or agency. The coordinating council was funded- by this administration in a significant way that had not been previously so I think that is the first step in a signal that the state is. Really trying to step up and be a partner with local government. To be our last brief comment. Mister chair. I would like to leave with this I think the center Hertzberg delighted an enormous opportunity you mentioned LAUSD. LAUSD is the largest landholders in the city of Los Angeles when you combine that with the state- college of. The city district. They get committee call just thank you. Up all of those land use decisions are ministered by the state there's a state agency that that administers a planning and land use for all of those properties- we've had some great successes with LAUSD. And between- UST and all you- this is the state college district alleys yeah thank you. There should be no surface parking lots left we need to build housing and parking on all of those sites that's a government owned property. Lake that's a golden opportunity and perhaps that's another bill that could be introduced but that could be something that would really take a bite out of exactly what we're trying to address and that is taking state property. And building on it without a loss of parking- that can be accomplished and there's an enormous opportunity- there thank you well here's what I get from this conversation this is gonna be the first one it certainly isn't the last one and I feel a heck of a lot of energy and enthusiasm for continued it callin. Balls and then up I thank you very much big round of applause you take out the morning. And. We get what I'm open the next panel still here. And I'm gonna call them up in the order on if you just line up I think we're putting another table up there as well right now it's doctor Sharon. Miss best an honest assault miss Leslie. Miss Ramsey Mister Harris. Missed. RAF starts my glasses any bring and- miss rock as. Thank you thanks right now it's okay. Assemblyman the right Mitchell fully make worked. For over the road gonna get started on what this what what the next pounds about what we really wanted to do was provide the committee and provide ourselves- you included a different perspectives and we wanted to make sure that we tackle they've not only from a local government I'm gonna continue here from a local government despite we wanted to see housing advocates a philanthropic advocates government- in all you folks are here combined together and obviously the county still on it and a law enforcement so everybody around the table here brings a unique perspective. Overly look how to challenge this issue of homelessness and actually actually have a significant dent in it I'm in the interest of time I'm gonna handed over immediately- conductor shared will ask folks to stay at their allocated amounts I think we told everybody try to stay five or underneath and but a quick Q. and a if you had to leave just let me know and because I realize is done just a little bit oversight Preciado. Thanks very much. To be here. And I will have to run after my comments because I'm supposed to be testifying at the board of supervisors about. A motion to expand the number of mental health treatment beds in Los Angeles county. After just completing a report. With numbers around three thousand beds and getting authorized in my department. To bring five hundred more online. Also just make a quick remark- related to mental health issues and death in. The streets and actually addictions and. A trauma our our our our primary drivers and co morbid mental illness and addictions are obviously critical I'd like to make another quick comment regarding senator. Senator Mitchell's point about sustainability. Too many people are becoming homeless. We have a massive amount of collaboration and effort and resource going into housing people and we it shouldn't have to be that big of a number. To sustain includes figuring out ways to not have to house that many people especially when we're losing the other thing I'll tell you from my perspective around mental illness and the number of people in the streets of mental illness mental illness is not one thing. There's a range of mental illness people live in the streets for long periods of time we'll developmental on this because it's a traumatizing experience. Individuals with what we would call severe persistent mental illness that's a smaller percentage than the numbers that people throw around and I think we have to be aware of that. I am here on behalf of the most vulnerable on it recognizing that there are multiple populations who are homeless and that we have an epidemic. And I think one of the things that is happening. In certain. Populations is that. There that the people are choosing to not be. House and I we have to look at that there are a lot of difficult questions and topics that I believe. Is one of them and one of the prop one of the reasons that's a problem is because it draws resource that we need for folks who are the most. Vulnerable the other thing I'll say is that it's not just about new develop and I'm really glad to hear that theme here we have the leverage the infrastructure that exists. We have to leverage it through things like the boarding care network that many of us are trying desperately to save. We have to look at as filin cells said subsidy. For housing that exists because we need to get it out sooner and we get need to get it out. Cheaper as far as people living on the street and this is a very controversial topic people living in squalor are actually increasing the demand and then we need. We're losing when people are living in squalor. Because people are getting sick. Gauge for how bad it is it is the death rate which is going up. People need a right to refuge and refuge. In my opinion is something that we don't fully understand and implement because it doesn't have to be. Permits part of housing unit it doesn't have to be a shelter bed we have to it we have a epidemic on our hands were collecting more and more. Illness and condition for people that are suffering in squalor we need to leverage our properties and do the kinds of things that our military does when there are. When we're going to battle and we're taking on major emergencies that's a different way and a different approach to get it to replacing the sidewalks. With place where people are not traumatized where they have more access to services more easily and they're not getting sick. In terms of mental health treatment beds and mental health resources in general supervisor Ridley Thomas mention to be able health center we are trying to leverage our health care campuses to developer sort of your villages. Across the county this department has invested. Over three hundred and fifty million dollars since I've been here in restorative care village asset and that includes urging Kerr's as well as- acute subacute and open transitional units we've also put in. A couple hundred million dollars into- into permits part of housing and development as well as services which we do. Every year but my focus is on the people who are the sickest in the most vulnerable and I think what we have to look at hot spots where people are dying we also have to be click here. In focusing on those who are most most vulnerable who are the least independent in who will who have almost no chance. Of getting into permits part of housing unless they give we give them a serious hand up will also say in this one is very close to the heart of a assemblyman Santiago. Involuntary treatment okay we have to. Revisit those laws and we have to go after them with empathy and heart we have to put our resources first and commit. Anyone who is a rights we're going to take away. We need to meet them with resources up for but we have direct ties those are not. Too loud. Close those who we cannot engage. Despite trying again and again we have to be able to figure out a way to get them into treatment and to get them into treatment to help foster their recovery in the only way you get people to recover is by giving them resources and I mean housing I mean egg dedicated treatment team. I mean. The hospital beds when they require them and a very well informed and resource to. A surrogate decision maker I don't know how much time that was but I'll stop it was good. Thank you yeah. Hi I'm sorry taught are often with the LA county department of health services and- with the housing for health program within the department health services of the last few years we built out a continuum of services from out reach to and from housing to permit housing with a focus on people who are homeless and how the most complex health and behavioral health conditions. And I just want to sort of- to make it very concrete share that over the last couple of years that I've been with housing for health we have- gone from a situation where our outreach workers could engage somebody on the very same day and move them into in term housing and have it bad for them that same day and be able to assist them into permanent housing within a few weeks or a couple of months. Managing a portfolio of about twenty four hundred intern housing beds now today what I can say is that like that stay in and from housing bad has shifted from. Maybe sixty to ninety days for we have clients are stained six months nine months even twelve months because we don't have the back door for that we don't have the permanent housing for them to move into- we- that the construction new construction. Of affordable and permanent supportive housing is a very big part the solution fully maximizing every federal rental subsidy is a very important part of the solution. I'm also just one elevate something that was touched on a couple of times here today which is investments is sort of like- local rental subsidies- we operate the flexible housing subsidy pool. Which is a way for us to very quickly move people back into housing. Is very flexible it's very nimble were able to provide rental subsidy support it could be short term until some to get back on their feet it could be longer term if somebody needs it could be a bridge to. A federal subsidy but what it does is it opens up the existing housing market. Buildings that already exist private property owners who are willing to take the subsidy. With knowing that they will have. Us behind it and a half according to behind it who they can contact twenty four seven if there's any issues with and it's a- really opens up a lot of units we just held serve at love eight. The investment of the potential for investing and stuff like flexible. Housing people as quick based path others this bull- thing. And then- also I just want to. Very briefly talk about boarding care- this is a really important part of the house to continue- especially for people who are homeless in of really complex healthy behavior health conditions- you get the housing. You get support with your activities of daily living you get Rick mind or to take medication you get transportation assistance is just such a key part of the housing network for certain sub population of people who are homeless. The crisis in our boarding care right now is huge the- it takes you know you know the average private pay for boarding cares about four thousand dollars per month per client- most of the clients were talking about who. Going into here with these complex issues are using a site that's paying about a thousand dollars a month. That's thirty five dollars a day that is less than what we April from how kilter. And we're asking the sites to do so much more terms of the care and support of people who are really complex. Up not to. Pull they cannot do the deferred maintenance. What do you the note people at that rate- who really need those settings so we need to figure out how to shore up our boarding care terrace of. Them with deferred maintenance and how to get enhanced services connected to those clients so that those boarding cares are sustainable and continue to operate. Thank you. Mr about. On minutes and thirty seconds rest assured of time to twice okay good morning chairman Santiago members of the assembly select committee. A Los Angeles county homelessness. I'm Robbie Harris a director with the Los Angeles police protective league that represents approximately ten thousand police officers from the rank of lieutenant. Down to the recruits in the academy. Appreciate appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today and I'll be focusing my comments around St that you've probably heard before such as Houston we have a problem. And how do you eat an elephant. And last don't reinvent the wheel. In two thousand and eleven the city of Houston have the sixth largest homeless population in America. The point in time homes count and survey identified eight thousand five hundred and thirty eight homeless individuals that year. Many of these individuals are in need of drug abuse mental health services and we're not receiving the care they desperately needed. And police officers were dispatched to somehow trying to help and manage a growing crisis. Houston was spending a hundred and three million dollars annually at the time on fewer than fifteen hundred chronically homeless individuals. The chronically homeless individuals comprise less 20% of the homeless population yet you seventy five percent. Of the public resources. Veterans also made up a large portion of Houston most population. Senate leaders soon declare Houston we have a problem. To address the problem the heads of the Houston and Harris County housing authorities. Directors of city and county housing development departments the VA service providers and community based organizations funded to do local veteran work sat at one table and talked. They created housing Houston's heroes and their initial goal was to permanently house one hundred veterans in one Hundred Days. They realize that it took over one hundred and fifty different steps for homeless veteran to navigate before getting shelter. From securing a photo ID a birth certificate to filling out almost identical paperwork for the housing authority in the VA. The local governments VA and service providers works together to cut the one hundred and fifty steps to fifty or sixty. And help the veterans navigate the entire process. In two thousand fifteen the city of Houston declared a virtual end. To veteran homelessness. And this past year's point in time homeless count and survey identified three thousand nine hundred and thirty eight homeless individuals. Down from eight thousand five hundred and thirty eight that's a 54% decrease in over a homelessness since two thousand eleven. Houston focused on a ratty kidding veteran homelessness they also kept working hard at reducing homelessness across all other population groups but they zeroed in on the veterans and they succeeded. In Los Angeles the numbers are so daunting it's like being asked how do you eat an elephant. My suggestion is to do it like Houston did one bite at a time and focus on the three thousand eight hundred and seventy eight homeless veterans the LA. Times reported were homeless this past veterans day. We all know the benefits of housing are homeless. You have heard and will hear the numbers budget implications and obstacles that stand in the way. The inevitable turf wars blame game and finger pointing can consume a thousand hearings just like this one. But now we know where there are successes in addressing this humanitarian crisis so let's go there. Said our egos aside and bring back what can work. Salt Lake City Phoenix and Houston. Have all had measurable successes in reducing the homeless population. Each of those cities has declared a virtual end to homeless veterans on their streets. They have a housing first attitude shelter first then the services and support. In fact the mayor of Phoenix Greg Stanton believes that the most important lesson from the success of the Phoenix model. Is that it can be replicated in any community in America and I believe them. Let's not reinvent the wheel. In Houston they created the way home a collaborative model to prevent and end homelessness. Their website is the way home Houston dot org. I encourage everyone to take time and look at what that city is done. And there are probably others that are moving the needle in the right direction and we should be open. To doing whatever is legal and ethical to rapidly adapt what we are currently doing to check achieve success. I urge this committee to find immediate funding and dispatch local and state decision makers and community based organizations to Houston to Phoenix to Salt Lake City. And see what the cities have done what they are doing and let's duplicated Los Angeles. We have a problem. Thank you. I think missile. Mister Harrison install next thanks. Hi I promise we didn't chat before about our remarks and what's interesting is that- we have lots to has hired the person in Houston who worked on that program and she has been helping us with our strategic planning and really looking at how the flow chart and how do you cut steps because that's really the bottom line on I wasn't planning on matching up but I think that's important set to bring up because I think we can learn from on the other cities and other counties. And I just think we have to approach this calmly nobody has all the answers we've got obviously we're here to do more and that was the question that you asked of us I want to thank you all for listening today and for the work that you're already doing I'm gonna just rapid fire some ideas because the question was posed to me what more can we do I'm and what can we do to try and sustain more. I will just quickly tell you aye approaches work as someone who's advised very selected officials as a deputy mayor a policy a but- but it's really my personal experience that is giving me the most exposure my brother is experienced homelessness because of six or mental illness for the last twenty years he's currently in jail I twenty hours he's awaiting placement in a state hospital so you're talking about these LPS laws and other laws I'm- deeply from your with some of the challenges. And they are in your hands on to be a. Really for the- ache. Amid. Bob let. Coming home life then to address it once they become homeless I'm I'm brought with me so- program that Lhasa has just launched in collaboration with the county and I'd love for you guys Ted take a look at it get it out to your constituents and see if this is something we can expand on a greater level it's just called basic problem solving it's another form of diversion but it's trying to meet people where they are in housing. And see what what's it gonna take through creative crisis management through- through conversation what's it gonna take to keep you in housing so that's something I'm gonna leave you with here today on the other thing I want to highlight which has been mentioned by several people but I'll take quickly is just the boarding care units I understand that you guys are looking at this AB and flow and for the Burke guards to funding but I'll just give you the brass taxes we lost a thousand units. If you multiply a thousand times thirty five dollars per day. Time three hundred sixty five days. You have twelve point seven million. So there's twelve point seven million in savings from that budget line item. That could be put towards saving the rest of those units. In LA county. And in other counties I'm sure experiencing the same issue. So I'm not saying you even necessarily need to look at and investment beyond. The investment that you've already budget. I'm just saying look at that budgeted amount. And start to figure out how you can allocate those that those dollars. If I'm wrong I apologize think about a different way. Excellent I I'm sure it's more complex but I just thought I'd point out the fact that we've already lost at thousand units. The other thing that you guys have all done each of you that is remarkable as your work around tenants rights. And we really appreciate that here in LA county but I do want to highlight on that Ellie city in LA county are working on greater access to legal advice. On through a variety of measures how important that is before coming here today I spoke with one of the public interest lawyers that's working with las at around prevention issues. And she specifically mentioned to me about a family who went to the Norwalk courthouse last week. File their paperwork around an unlawful eviction. Did not get the correct advice to file for a fee waiver. Later told your owing two hundred euro two hundred dollars to file. Tape by this addiction. They left the courthouse because they couldn't pay the two hundred dollars. So without access to good legal advice. The amazing laws that you have passed will not have the effect you want. I the other thing I wanted to just point out is take piggy back on some of the conversations around. Access to immediate housing options. And I appreciate senator Hertzberg comments around any type of government property is incredibly useful that cuts costs it also can help expedite the building of those units. Or their their location of safe parking I just wanted to make sure that is also highlighted today. Whether it's cabin communities motel conversions sprung structures. Safe parking. The all of those needs we need more of it. On the other issue that we've been working on it loss that is more rapid re housing so it is someone who as or family who is actually become homeless. But again through a smaller level of subsidy we can rapidly re house them and that's something that's proved effective throughout. Throughout a lot of different neighborhoods and I want to encourage that on to be expanded. The other thing we haven't talked about is housing options and rental assistance for those who don't meet federal criteria based on their immigration status. Federal programs are really targeting folks and I wanna make sure we're aware of state funding and local funding being used effectively to fight back. We raise this issue of why were in so deep a hole I just want to be clear the federal government continues to cut and has cut housing subsidies over the years to the tune of seventy percent. So that is an issue to keep front and center. We also need to look at on incentives for smaller cities to do more Phil and sell did a great job of talking about the ways that the county is looking at- encouraging that. I know several of you are working with some of the smaller cities and I just want to encourage more of that. We do need a higher level of care for most vulnerable and I appreciate Dr Sharon's remarks around the mentally ill obviously I experience that daily with my brother. On and the innovations that were working on specifically in your district. On center draws so where are exciting. On but we also need access to substance abuse treatment. On and that is a huge issue on the on at for many populations. Are gaps analysis coming out of Los at the end of this month it's going to be talking a little bit more. About on. The specific details around the housing needs for some of our most vulnerable. So I just wanted to highlight that and will make sure to get you a copy. Please continue your work around eliminate lake eliminating regulations that get in the way of immediate help. So your work on SB eleven ninety seven was critical we need more of it. On at some of the bills that you guys are all working on it been. Are great and we're excited about but as I said federal cuts at 70% we need to look at some permanent support said support for. Affordable housing whether that's SB two I know you are looking at tax increment financing for SB five. Those are important on vehicles. Finally I had the honor of serving on the commission with Jacqueline Wagner from enterprise foundation. She could not be here today. Through her leadership and many others listed on the report that I'm gonna leave with you. Los the launch the ad hoc committee on black persons experiencing homelessness. The goal was to listen and to create understanding around black people are significantly over represented here locally and nationally by those experiencing homelessness. The answer is simple and yet complex. Structural racism has played a significant role. The report put forth sixty seven recommendations some housing assessment tools are missing cultural competency other ways of getting better access to immediate housing. And we're beginning to take a hard look at that issue and many other recommendations but we won't win if we don't create systems that work for absolutely everyone. I want to leave you with a copy of that on hopefully I've got copies for everyone thank you. I think it was a. Well thank you I merry Leslie in prison a Los Angeles business council on an honor to be here today thank you chairman Santiago for inviting us here and also for all of you being here today- it's my pleasure to share some of the key findings of the- L. A. B. C. institute LA times and UCLA poll you heard quite a bit about it today- I think each of the committee members have. A short version of the graphics in their pockets for those of you who do not have a short version you can go to our website at LA this is counsel dot org on the pole is- there it's available is a transparent it's free please spend quality time with it but to just give you a few high points as polls conducted in October it was over nine hundred one registered voters in LA county- the key findings of the poll I'm just going to mention a few highlights some of which are to mention today. This is probably first time we've ever seen 95% as a number ever ever ever. Ever ever okay so. I think and the key about that is it's everyone it doesn't matter if you're conservative it doesn't matter if you're moderate does not if you're liberal. You agree that this is the number one issue. Facing LA county it's also impacting the mood of the county as a whole. Majority say they are personally affected by homelessness a significant number of people say. That they have experienced it recently many voters feel or most of the voters feel empathetic towards the homeless and most tended thing. Societal factors not choices made by individuals or the root of the problem. Or not blaming the homeless. Well a lack of affordable housing is seen as a major grow- growing problem voters are even more likely to point to the lack of mental health. Services as the met major driver of homelessness. Voters voters have not lost faith the pop on campus all. Large majority support of writing concrete options both systemic and contemporary voters want forward thinking solutions that will actually fix the problem over the long term. But at the same time there is a high degree of urgency around the issue and large majorities want to see the city take quick. Tangible steps to address it. Even if the changes require additional resources or- or affecting their own neighborhood. I would ask you to look at the top plan results of the poll you also have that in your packet for the committee members on. We also a few questions. These are basic questions if more than five hundred thousand new units are needed to meet the current housing demand which proposals would you support a range of options were supported by more than 60% of the voters offering incentives to apartment owners. To keep rents low promoting more affordable housing by allowing greater density along transportation hubs and supporting a rent control ordinance to keep pace with inflation. We ask voters about the legal right to shelter or housing 75% of them supported requiring the government to provide temporary shelter. To any homeless person who wishes to come indoors we test is support for what other cities have been doing to address the homeless problem this got a resounding- response of more than 70% Favorite speeding up development permit support of housing such as apartments built out of factory built modular. Units teeny houses trailers and other structures using emergency relief tests like those used by the red cross and FEMA to bridge to more permanent housing. Opening up National Guard armory and using public property for temporary shelters like we do for other emergencies providing public bathrooms and showers to support homeless. Residents as they live on the street in the neighborhoods using shed light cabins community cabins quipped with cots electricity and plumbing as temporary housing. For up to forty people at a time until individuals are connected to permit housing and allowing conversion of single family homes to dorm. Style developments were multiple tenants share common areas. Then the LA you see I'm I'm doing this in two and a half minutes three minutes I suggest you take a look a longer look at it I'm trying to give you the high points we then discernment that we at our eighteen to and we don't housing some of it two weeks ago on we create a call to action so what do we think based on the poll results in the years of our research and advocacy. We think that it's time- to address this issue with urgency innovation collaboration for those reasons we believe the following actions should be considered by you all- we agree with supervisor mark Ridley Thomas and they're Steinberg that it is time to enact a legal imperative to provide a roof for every homeless individual and family. We think whether it's a shelter bridge housing navigation centers I support of housing every Angelino should have the right to a roof over their head ultimate goal of being placed in permanent supportive housing this legal mandate must be paired with wraparound services to address health and substance abuse issues. To begin funding this imperative we believe the state should make an emergency appropriation of two billion dollars Mitchell for matching funds for local jurisdictions to fund the development of twenty thousand units of emergency shelters and bridge housing Acosta listen hundred thousand prepare. For the long term the state should find a permanent source of funding for homeless housing similar to SB two for affordable housing we support mayor Steinberg and really Thomas is just and that reallocation of a large portion prop sixty three for mental health services if needed. This thing should be call related with a plan for LA to get our new Reno targets which were just just happened last month which include four hundred and seventy six thousand income and affordable units for LA county under 110020% of a online we have never. The number like that. That means we. Thirteen the estimated- last week in a report they release that that would be up the hundred thirty four billion in subsidy. As homelessness is not confined to single municipality we would encourage the expansion of AB eleven ninety seven thank you chairman and- at least to the borders of LA county if not statewide we must look at incentivizing low low cost construction types. On namely modular housing with the average cost permits were housing being roughly six hundred thousand we think the cost could be greatly reduced. Currently the barriers in California or that we don't have a lot of it we need to look at how we're going to on incentivize modular housing and state. And for a man's for advanced manufacturing facilities in here in LA county to create more jobs finally we think. We should build a success along of short term solutions like the sprung shelters with bunk beds as successfully used in San Diego San Francisco Pomona Fresno and look at Oakland's community cabins all dramatically increasing the number of housing units types of housing units smaller units. Available for immediate shelter I'm certain locality senses the city of LA cannot you like structures such as committee cabins because of the currently permitted they're not currently for and it the state. Would like you to help us we don't know if that's a ministry to or legislator the state of California should develop an expedited process to prove low cost easily deployable structures that can be utilized. As emergency in around housing Marie Ramsey and I'm here on behalf of the central city association we are a membership organization comprised of about four hundred members focused on downtown's vibrancy and increasing investment in the region. And I'll keep my remarks brief because I know it's been a long hearing- and a lot of great stuff has been said I agree with all the previous speakers. I think just real big picture we need a lot more housing we haven't been building and not. At housing production is falling behind over the last seventy years I'll share some stats from the city of LA- and I think to that end of for this group- we really need to consider something like SB fifty that would enable the construction of housing statewide. I think until we get to more units everywhere we're going to be facing this problem over and over again and I also think we need to figure out a way to get private sector to build more units that are affordable by right. We are never going to have enough subsidies do that so we need to figure out a way to involve people. And just quickly to share some stats- in the city of Los Angeles before nineteen. Thirty died me bill almost. Nothing. In nineteen seventy nine without about four hundred thousand units. From nineteen eighty to nineteen ninety nine we built about two hundred and forty one thousand units. From two thousand till now we've built about a hundred and thirty seven thousand units. So our production has sharply fallen. I'm here in downtown we've seen a great production of units but we're still just scratching the surface. So as state legislators we thank you for your attention to this matter we appreciate your hard work in your commitment- and we ask that you embrace something like SB fifty this next legislator. Thank you. Thank you. I'm their best on the executive director of the historic core business improvement district and I also serve on the HHH- oversight committee and- I'd echo what Marie said- appreciate all the comments on housing and the fact that we need to build more and faster and for less money that was one of the things on the committee that was very disappointing to us is the high cost per unit and we really wanted to push the idea of shared housing and other more innovative ideas and just eight you know we get get gets away from you you don't have much time to implement this and that. And it takes to develop these per is to long- so I have a great many ideas about that to discuss at another time and I was asked mainly focus on- mentally ill and addicted which as a function of the bed we've worked on with individuals on the streets implemented I never approach I'm sorry excessively in some not- SB eighty two with of them. I'm not can didn't that are sky high and if you have a medical emergency that it can cripple you financially and many financial reasons why people end up in homelessness but it feels like the stigma of mental illness diction and- is still preventing us from help those who need it the most. I'm in the eighteen sixty one the hospital's of close down. Kennedy in the rated the now it's to the mental health. It was a- temperature than you know they were considered in hospitable- the mentally ill were then left to. Their own communities- and the support the local support just never came- and by the time Reagan took office over four hundred thousand people. Had already been released into their communities from the state hospitals- so if you research now state after state- it. Has two function and deal with people who suffer from and also knows yeah- which is that they don't recognize their illness and they don't speak voluntary on going care. Op so what that means really is ER's and prisons are are defective care for these folks and- that's inappropriate in in humane- and now people are being released on. The streets- due to propositions and other legislation without the support they were promised. So I'm not gonna miss words of what we have here now is just a saying to a sanctioned system of neglect. And we need to first recognize that and then vowed to change it- we need support from our brother and sister state this is not just a local issue or a California issue this is a national issue- Medicaid needs to support. Care for mental illness for larger inpatient facilities- when we pass legislation like prop sixty three for once we need to make a priority people suffering from severe mental illness- we need to create longer term beds and not allow people in crisis to be released within a matter of hours. In a vulnerable fledgling state- we need to look at the late term in Petra short act which was mentioned earlier by- supervisor mark Ridley Thomas- we need to re evaluate how the holds are being utilized are they being utilized and do the guidelines actually have positive results for anyone suffering from mental illness. But the law was intended to end in debt indefinite inappropriate holds guarantee public safety prevent unnecessary expenditures and protect persons with mental health disorders from criminal acts. I think anecdotally in statistically we can tell that that's not what that's not what is happening- people are cycling. In and out of the E. R. on a regular basis- cycling to the prison system we're spending resources attempting to turn law enforcement personnel into mental health care providers rather than using doctors and nurses already trained in the field. Rather than providing places for people to go that protects them- and others- and we have a brewing public safety and public health crisis so I. I just feel like that's a that's an excellent place to start and it says it's a subsector the population that to me is- very near and dear to me as I'm been downtown working amongst it for seventeen years and lived here for over eight. Thank you want to try and going last but there's a lot of things that have already been set I'm sorry. That's right. Yeah yeah so- I'd obviously there's a lot of really good ideas that were discussed here today and- much like assembly member Santiago said this is just the first of many discussions- we are family at least from our point of view. On the ground you know and serving the community that all of us are fighting for we want to make sure that the urgency the sense of urgency that is being articulated today- is kept up and- also turned into velocity you know we know that resources are here we know that- money is here. But we also want to make sure that the dollar that we get turned into a dollar twenty five that the minute were trying to save turns into two minutes because that's really kind of what we're living with you know- now that in two thousand sixteen a lot of these measures. Passed one of the things that you know I just wanna take an opportunity to do is to echo some of the things that again on the ground that were living with that we want to make sure look really gets at home as priority. You know senator Mitchell. Clearly outlined that you know things AB and flow so a lot of the things that I think that our community keeps you know. What keeps us about it is when this runs out. Like let's just say for example we get the majority of the people off the street and housing services provided. How does the funding for the next five ten fifteen years how do we sustain that. You know so while we take the chronically homeless or the those that are on the street and lift them up into a house environment. What are we doing to stop the slippage of economic homelessness or youthful homelessness or things like that so was worth reading those two parallel tracks today because we do have the sense of urgency. Let's not forget that we have the obligation responsibility and the next five ten fifteen years to make sure that that's funded and supported as well. So I to federal level as long as there's like awareness that's given to that other opportunities that we can leverage states such as Medicaid Medicare how. We know that there's a lot of individuals on the street that are aging in place that they're going to have a lot of different needs and the next to five five to ten years. Are there senior living facilities that we can convert some of the homeless population that we have today that opens up units that we can continue to move people in off the street. But making sure that we look at it kind of as a system as a conduit to continue to solve. Some of the law the law more local or state you know- focus solutions get. Everyone's already thank you know assembly member Thiago before AB eleven ninety spent but developer at its get row housing tract. That is really going to help us perpetuate facilitating hit velocity of development. So it gets people off measure H. helps us provide service. Master and then was a lot of Xin earlier big act I can workforce develop and how do we allow people to perpetuate itself state. It doesn't mean they have like a large sum of money to. Do it I feel like they're contributing to self success and giving back to the community. One of the last- key points that I think that you know a will be at the organization wanna make and treat said at a very very well earlier. Is they can move the needle very quickly a lot faster than we can so when we. Facilitates sport and help the community is that ours are on the street once their house they are faster at finding solutions and finding the people that still need to be housing breaking down those barriers and the last pieces of the data all of us talk about data you know and from our organization from. Al all of our you know counterparts is. Angeles and California are leading data providers we can be- the solution that sometimes we hear about like Houston is huge we know that there's a lot of air time on that but Los Angeles and San Francisco in Sacramento we have the data we've solve problems. We can do influences kinda nationwide as well so- with that again thank you very much for this opportunity and allowing me to close this out. Thank you very much all panel many good people we need to include the mall but- I really appreciate that I'm gonna open up to. A to the committee members of those any questions this Hertzberg. This store make a statement that so much a question. You know recently under the leadership of assembly member- com all their dove. She did a great job in bringing us together is in LA county delegation. I think it's something like forty members of the legislature between both the assembly and the Senate representing LA county. And I gotta tell you it's important message to go forth to all of us. I think the thing that came out of that is that we all agreed before this but I was before this polar wasn't it was it was influenced by that or not I would suggest it was before that. Which we're going to make this a priority we're going to develop a strategic plan and we've already of the monks ourselves talked about a number of the issues that are represented here today. But to really be a dynamic force from LA county it's hard to pull us all together from all different corners of the county people in one but every the county and the other is a county don't we know each other well we have a good. And this is a priority and you're gonna see I think and I think this this hearing today. Are the German was there. Was was is part of that effort and so I I'm really excited about that I'm excited about the interest among all of us and the willingness for all of us to work together to take a strategic approach. For deliverables for us Senate forty members of the legislature I think we have some ability particularly with the number of us who are on their to actually have some important immediate impact. Please I'm trying to get. That same out county caucus conveniently the meeting. Over here now- we also heard from doctor sharing and heard the issue about the board and care and so is something we're definitely gonna pay attention to I wish it was it was. Mathematically a simple as you suggested the bad that are going to use and it's just not- so forgive me for. Shaking my head which distracted you- but but we are clear about the challenge- and as I said earlier you know the notion of government and we create these funding silos you know the fact that eighteen HHX dollars can be used to fund board care beds. Was perhaps short sighted and so yeah. They can you can you confirm the services but not the bad or the reverse. Eighty so if you fund the bed. Did not no place like home actually. ATK. There are several nay taking projects that are you know the but they're not. And talk about the things that they actually are everything. Because it funds the bad enough to service am I saying that right it's funds the if funds the service. HHH is only half right. Ease of use. That term. Right so what funds the bed death but not the services that need to go along in a board and care for funding. For supporting that person. That's right. Yeah right. No place like home. I got it I got it so the point is valid that we create these funding streams that are so silence so narrow that we don't have the flexibility big to be creative so we're going to look at- the role we have played in under cutting the boarding care system in a very meaningful way- the doctor here brought that to our attention. I times is covered in our colleague assembly member bloom actually had a bill- but but we at the caucus are going to put our shoulder to the grindstone and prioritize the board care issue. I think the shared housing piece is another example of- you know how can we creatively come up with ways to X. to extend the reach. In impact of the dollar. And so- we will continue to do that- some of us have tour doubles municipalities aye I think he's gone- I went to Utah that's why California is now a- housing first date we went to Utah saw that came back introduced the bill. I went to Utah and that's why California now has a- homeless coordinating council I'm and so we've been to those places we look at the models- and we all have to acknowledge that you know California eight Utah or Arizona- we have- unique- characteristics- and unique challenges and unique opportunities. And so we're looking at those models and bringing to bear what is appropriate let's helpful that's not new we've done that for a number of years. And will continue to do so- I think what is new. For us what I did see in you thought and didn't experience. The cal. Our policy. What do you top five years ago. Is now we are in a place where every level of government sense federal government but death while actions matter- are on the same page. When the state took the vote to eliminate redevelopment. This they walked away. And an expected municipalities to figure it out. The state walked away when the state in the early two thousands cut cal work grant deeply- and so every level of government has to bear some responsibility but the fact that we are now on the same page when you can see the example an H. HHH and heat alphabet soup where we are putting our collective resources and energy and bright thinking and commitment to sustained investment over time that creates a new space in a way in which I think we are operating as government California and that's the good news that I take away- from the action that we take in. Thank you very much for inviting members of the Senate dissipate this hearing I was sharing with my colleagues. My sitting pro TM when she never first these to the assembly chair of the select committee. And had a hearing very similar to today S. Skid Row we start the morning we walked to Skid Row. Then we came in and had a hearing. I wish I could but ten years the data has improved it at that has that much. What struck me then is consistent today when we look at quite frankly the complexion of those who need the services and the complexion of those to provide the services it's still Chiu strikingly different I'm not sure why that is- vertically when you hear a message from to reset. Where people talk about want to know that they're talking to someone who's had a sure there lived experiences so I think we also have a lot of work to do. To make sure that we are. Listening hearing scheme and being compassionate and our policy. And that would developing housing and policy responses that are meaningful and relevant to the people who need the services. Thank you for the invitation today and for all of you for participating. Since the first of all let me say thank you very much- echo what my colleagues on the Senate has already raised- I would not be redundant but I will say I think the panel was very robust I appreciate- each of you have certainly given me a greater insight- I've tried to take a very copious notes- around paper nice I use in my bones I wasn't texting anywhere disrespecting. But but I've certainly believe that I have some policy ideals that will- one is very timely because we're on recess we go back in January Chiang were six. And we have an opportunity to go back and take what you have shared and create some public policy but I think it would help move the needle and also look at tangible- measurable- changes taking place around homelessness here- and- California and so I want to thank. Everyone and I want to apologize for eating now- what at opportunity to hear the public- I'm hearing. Testimony but I'll look at that. And I will suggest the chairman if- at the staff in other will provide. A some notes that you may have shared and share those knows with the entire our offices. Here maybe follow ups thank you much. If you're. The card is already plotting and planning. But but look we want to thank everybody who's you're not gonna go long winded and speech here but but what I do want to say what's unique about it in this was part of the conversations that we've had over the years in terms of prioritizing- homelessness. Homelessness issue- was to create select committee for LA county that was specific but what what was also unique about it I think is that the fact that. You have most of the other a good portion Daly members were active on the issue here and then- and all all I go with my colleagues of said we invited the Senate as well so we just don't only have support on the assembly side from a few people but we- also have. The support on on the side and not your- and people who carry weight as well- the budget chair on the Senate side and the Majority Leader on the Senate side- oddity Mister draws of who. Covers the ski area well we tried to buy the way it will have some sort of. Tangible gains. Budget just. When it in the book. The people's together not a plan out over the next year. From the how big substantive change. Or at least make some serious Denson and achieving- to house people. Now I do wanna take of the moment- the go to hope- public comments. And we've asked the public comments could be held to one minute. If that's okay no one thank you. Again for that if I'm speeding through its just because we went over by about a half hour sub also learned. A little bit about that as well so banks. If we start with public comments were the Mike public comment because I could see that it I know that we had a represents a canister white who was invited to participate but- if we could have you go first if you if you're okay with that. You have. A baby. Okay that's fine. Let's get that for the remainder of the people we're gonna cut off at one minute during public comments and I just feel really fast. Nine nine I appreciate that I just. Thank you. One is I will be following up with all the presenters and so forth on next steps as well thank you so really quickly my name is white with the Los Angeles community action network based here in Skid Row right down the street the founder of LA can twenty five years ago and so just a couple of things really quickly losses twenty nineteen dated documented that 71% of houses people are households as a result of housing affordability housing availability and poverty only twenty nine percent. Reported the house lives as a result of mental. The music diagnoses. Portent at will **** issue that we're not target in the issue in the inverse oftentimes with thinking. It's as a result of mental illness and substance abuse where it's very clearly about housing. This points to structural and institutional racism in a broken system safety net of care the points organized abandonment with roots in de industrialization. The drug wars a cretin cling climb bill and related expansions of prisons targeting black and brown. People welfare reform and the decimation of the safety net as you spoke of earlier- honorable I'm Mitchell this is not a by product of bad decisions by individuals. This is a systematic attack on surplus workers and communities of color that no longer had value senator Dorado was absolutely correct. When she said that we must take into account the seven hundred. Twenty one thousand families each one point five million people who are currently. Being hopeless you were irate. Out of. This thing is. Not a static dominant right three things we must tackle run play rents per building unit cost of six hundred thousand plus 45% of those costs going to the building. 40% going toward soft costs and 11% covering the lan must not happen city owned property both weapon buildings must be used to deal with the crisis. The city of Los Angeles own seven thousand parcels not four hundred twenty eight arm of both land and structures we need to go back and harking back to the times of mayor Tom Bradley when he opened. City hall to house house was people we need to make sure we have. Government land lastly we must stop all instead of criminalization of house was people instead provide public health infrastructure for and sheltered. Houses people additionally municipalities must stop pursuing the overturning a federal court just. Like Martin forces boys. Are in order simply read communities of those people. We the land need city owned land we need to reduce the cost of building and we need to get our office today. And we're not be eight to speak out rate. Thank you so much. Mister white. City your reference that. Hi so that's and that's basically it that's not big. Well that's the at entire available you land and buildings that the city of Los Angeles owns today that came out of a report that was released two months ago from Ron CalPERS so it's seven thousand parcels of both raw land and building I would say on the properties with buildings on them in Los Angeles we have the adaptive reuse ordinance we need to put the adaptive reuse. Ordinance in fact we all know that building cost. But for buildings that have been long abandoned there's no profit there so we need to return those to people for one dollar per month. Yeah right and the rest of the comments we're going to keep the one minute- that was a special. Reason for that thank you. We have as a meaning. A good afternoon that you guys so much for your time my name's Alex contrast I'm with the housing coalition- statewide nonprofit called California yes in my backyard and one thing that I've frequently come across is that local cities I live within the county but in the city of Downey are often resistant to these measures and issues and solutions that we are trying to come up with two day. And one way that you guys can make it more easier is the advocating through state what policy that out Ste essentially forces cities to take action since they're not held accountable where the can do that is through SB fifty of more homes act currently right now we are faced housing shortage and most people that I work with are on the verge of becoming homeless because they're having the right burdened. Dust people to talk to days day people who cannot afford to live a were they are currently where they work- and they're forced into longer commutes which hurts our environment- so essentially if we can build homes more homes where. The jobs are at that would. Help tax this is. There is some time. Course every was government my name is Corey Patterson I am a current resident Skinner housing trust graciously. Things that reflected today in my mind are the complexion of this is issue a shocking. Urgent urgent urgent. Money is power but I will add action is honor. Adaptive assistance is needed as least spoke about I would love to graduate into a section eight housing with that company. I am in. A great assisted living program I'm not an addict I have an assisted dog David gap did to comedy me I'm gracious and gracious for everybody in this room and this time. Thank you very much. Any additional comments yes please yeah. In all these things all the and I've been previously been a resident here at the mine cart fifteen years ago- and I've been on my own for those fifteen years and right now I'm dealing with my bill is being. Sold and the guy is already knocking on doors trying to give a get us to get cash for keys and we have other issues but my big big issue for you guys because you're state level and the city doesn't have anything to do with it. How are you guys going to or what can you do about the- Ellis act because it's been used an abuse in ways that it wasn't right there virtually but intended to. Thank you next. Hi some my background with homelessness is that my parents were homeless- when I was two weeks old and it was a family of four children and so all throughout my life AB try to understand how did they get homeless because they were brilliant people and so I noticed that it can happen to anyone and I is could possibly happen to me very soon- the thing that I currently live that is- housing trust building but I was in there- experiment that they started in two thousand twelve with a house artist. The newspaper actually me about that experience and you know it could rate and we'll see what happens seven years later I'm still there but now they are- they just raised our rents and we believe there's about eight units in that building that has not been house for years now. On top of that I'm their issues that are happening at you can see how people can back into homeless very quickly and that better. Learn I mean. So what. Ten and we need are also if we can stop the things that are happening right now that is one of the most important things that we can do. Because yes you're fine. No no definitely but I'm just saying that we don't have help I need help I don't know who to go to I just met Lee so I hopefully that'll I help something out there but I do doctor office in the back and then we'll could have they're entitled your office. As well. Thanks I would like to. Thank you. Francis yes mean Moti wala a candidate for Congress in CA thirty four. And I a for someone to say thank you so much for all the work that you're doing and having this meeting- couple things I want to draw attention to. One is at the federal level is great to hear some conversation suggesting things that they can do. I wanted to point out the people's action how Aaron T. at something that as you all- talked your colleagues above you and in the federal level a something encourage our representatives and senators to be. Looking into in sporting- because I do believe that at the federal level we have a lot to cheap to support the work that you're doing. A second I just want to bring up the- over the next decade we have. Challenges on climate change in addressing not. And this crisis and we've got a potential Olympics coming to Los Angeles. And I just want to make sure that. That our leaders are looking at- the potential costs and impacts of the Olympics on our- poor up. On the poor and just to be. So many just please pay attention to the a large cost per sister short period of time the benefits just a small group of people and can have a massive impact on everyone else thank you.
