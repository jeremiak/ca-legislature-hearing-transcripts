THAT HAS ARISEN REGARDING INTERPRETATION OF SIX INTO A ONE THE DISCHARGE STATUTE AND IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IT SHOULD APPLY IN THE CONTEXT OF WORKERS AT BASEBALL PARKS IN THE STATE. I'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY AND I'M ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION S. CI YOU THE TEAMSTERS UNITED HERE SELA CA O. C. AND OTHERS. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. AND THAT. LEADS TO A CLARIFICATION OF THE LABOR CODE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF WHAT WE WANT IS THAT WORKERS WHAT THE PRACTICE HAS BEEN IS THAT WORKERS OF ALWAYS BEEN PAID ON THE REGULAR PAY PERIOD AND THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE. WITHOUT THE NEED TO DISBURSE PAYMENTS AT THE END OF GAMES CONCERTS OR OTHER EVENTS AT THE BALL PARKS THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED WELL ACCEPTED PRACTICE PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AT ALL THE BEST BASEBALL PARKS. AND IT'S JUST THE PRACTICE THAT HAS. BEEN ACCEPTED AND US SUPPORTED BY THE EMPLOYEES OF WITH ME OUR SAN FERNANDO IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE LOS ANGELES DODGERS.

ON OUR LAST REGULAR AT LEAST SCHEDULE GAME THIS SEASON IS SUNDAY SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH. NY PLAYING SAM'S TEAM. IT'S ALWAYS A EXCITING WHEN WE'RE PAYING PLAYING OUR RIVALS. BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPOSSIBLE IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO PAY ALL OF OUR BALLPARK EMPLOYEES AT THE END OF THAT GAME. WHEN YOU COUNT OUR- AYE SUREST TICKET TAKERS SECURITY GUARDS. AB CONCESSION WORKERS WE HAVE OVER THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD THAT WORK EVENTS AND SO. TO REQUIRE THE TEAMS. TO STAY AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO PAY EVERYONE AT THE END OF THIS GAME. IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE IMPRACTICAL AND COULD LEAD TO ERRORS IN PAY WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO INVITE. INSTEAD THOSE WORKERS THAT ARE THERE ON THE TWENTY NINTH WILL BE PAID FIVE DAYS LATER ON FRIDAY OCTOBER FOURTH. AB SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS EVER SINCE WE WERE SEATED ON THIS ISSUE. WE'VE RENEGOTIATED OUR CBA'S WITH OUR EMPLOYEE UNIONS IN THIS IS NOT BEEN RAISED. AS A CONCERN BY OUR UNION SO. WE ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF. PROTECTING A PRE PACKED A PRACTICE THAT WORKS.

MANY MANY YEARS CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN GENERAL COUNSEL WHICH IS THIRTY SIX YEARS. WITH THE DODGERS. IT REALLY REFLECTS THE- PRACTICAL OR REALLY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PAIN OUR EMPLOYEES ARE DAVE GAME EMPLOYEES AT THE END OF A GAME OR OR OF AN EVENT OR- ANY POSSIBILITY SOMETIMES OF DETERMINING WHEN THE SEASON WELL AND- I AM CHAU.

JACKIE STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND YOUR WONDERFUL STAFF FOR REACHING A COMPROMISE AND WE ARE NEUTRON THE BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. HI. IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HERE YOU CAN. PLEASE. IT WAS A DONE DEAL BE ON BEHALF OF THE- WORKING STADIUMS. WE THOUGHT WE HEARD TODAY ABOUT MY NAME IS DENNIS MÃ¡S ACTUALLY. THERE IS LABOR CO TWO ALL ONE HAS A LENGTHY HISTORY IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION. TECH PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE LAID OFF FROM WORK. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE LAID OFF FROM WORK IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY BACK IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDRED SAYS. IT'S FOR THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE PEOPLE WHO WERE LAID OFF ME THEIR PAY. PROMPTLY. NO JUST. THE GIANTS AND DODGERS TO PAY SOMEBODY AT THE END OF THE GAME. THE END OF THE SEASON HAD DIFFICULTY DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW. BUT WAIT FOR THE PROPOSED HERE GIVES YOU TO WE GIVE THEM TO OVER TWO WEEKS IF YOU IF IT BILL TALK ABOUT LABOR CO TWO OH FOUR. IT SO HAPPENS MAYBE IF THE SEASON ENDS ON THE END OF THE MONTH. TO BE PAID IN FIVE DAYS. BUT IF THEY'RE PAID ON THE SECOND OR THIRD IF THE LAST NAMES THE SECOND OR THIRD. THEIR PAY TWO WEEKS LATER THESE PEOPLE NEED THEIR MONEY THAT WAS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF THIS LAW ORIGINALLY. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES THE CANNING CURING. AND DRYING INDUSTRIES GOT AN EXCEPTION TO THE LAW. THOSE INDUSTRIES OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS. THE GIANTS THE DODGERS IT WAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF TIME RECORDS AND PAY RECORDS CAN EASILY ME A SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE THEY DON'T HAVE TO CALCULATE IT AT THE END OF THE LAST GAME IF YOU AMEND THE BILL TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE GET PAID PROMPTLY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THE DRILLING INDUSTRY WHEN OIL WELLS DRY UP THE DRILLING INDUSTRY CAME THE LEGISLATURE TO SAID. WE NEED AN EXCEPTION IS TOO HARD TO GET THE CHECKS OUT TO THESE PEOPLE. THEY GOT A TWENTY FOUR HOUR EXCEPTION. WITH A RULE THAT SAYS IF IT FALLS ON A WEEKEND YOU CAN YOU DON'T COUNT THE WEEKEND DAYS. I THINK BASEBALL CAN DO THAT I THINK BASEBALL DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYEES WAIT. AND IT'S HIGHER UP TO TWO OR MORE WEEKS TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A PRO. EMPLOYEE LEGISLATURE SOME OF YOU MARCHED WITH THE FURLOUGHED WORKERS OF THE STATE WELL THESE ARE FURLOUGHED WORKERS BUT THESE ARE FURLOUGHED WORKERS WHO ARE POSSIBLY IN THE WORKING POOR. THE HOT DOG VENDORS THE PIER SELLERS THEY WORK HARDER THAN SOME OF THESE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR. A YEAR PITCHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN THOSE AISLES WITH CARING BEER SELLING HOT DOGS AND THE USHERS IN THE- THESE ARE THESE ARE WORKING PEOPLE OF MANY OF WHOM. MAYBE YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I KNOW IN LOS ANGELES YOU'RE A LOT OF WORKERS AT DODGER STADIUM WHO WORK THROUGHOUT THE CITY. YOU COULD DO DIRECT DEPOSIT IN A WEEK YOU CAN DO DIRECTOR MAYBE A WEEK IF SEVENTY TWO HOURS IS THAT TOUGH. FOR THE GIANTS THE DODGERS MAKE IT A WEEK. BUT I STILL THINK THEY COULD DO IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THEY HAVE TO THEY CAN EVEN DO IT IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLY WITH THE LAW. THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN A TRADITION FOR ALL THESE YEARS NOT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. DOESN'T MAKE IT CORRECT. I UNDERSTAND THAT LABOR AND MANAGEMENT OF GOT ALONG FOR YEARS ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. THEY MAY HAVE HAD MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO BUT THE REALITY IS THESE WORKERS NEED THEIR MONEY. THEY NEED THEIR MONEY WOULD BE NICE TO GET A TOMB SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. YOU HAVE TO PAY THEIR BILLS THEIR CREDIT CARD DEBT INTERESTS IS GOING UP YET TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES NEED TO FOR TRANSPORTATION. WHY MAKE IT TWO WEEKS. AND THAT'S WITH THE BILL ALLOWS IN THIS LABOR CO TWO OH FORCE RIGHT I URGE YOU. THINK VERY HARD ABOUT THIS. AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE INVOLVED. AND MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TABLE ISN'T STUDY THE- AND IT'S ODD TO ME THIS IS THE ONLY INDUSTRY. YOU HAVE TO CUT YOU OUT DRIVE TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR FOR BASKETBALL AND SOCCER. AND IN AGRICULTURE IN AGRICULTURE PEOPLE LOOK THE PROPS YOUR PET. THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY PEOPLE WITHIN A WEEK THAT VIOLATES THE LAW SUPPOSED TO PAY THEM IMMEDIATELY. BUT IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE NEED TO ADDRESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FEEDBACK. OF ANYONE ELSE SUPPOSED. OKAY RETURNED BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT'S THE RUMOR GONZALEZ. I THINK I'M USING YEARS I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER NINE IN. I LITERALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER ARE CSEA EMPLOYEES. AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR ARE THEY IS THERE TIME GIVEN. DOES ANYONE NOW. I WAS JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE IT IS SOMEWHAT. SIMILAR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WHO KIND OF HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION AND AN END THERE BECAUSE THEY TECHNICALLY LOSE THEIR JOB EVERY YEAR BASICALLY ANYWAY JUST A CURIOSITY OF HOW HOW THEY'RE DEALT WITH I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ON A REGULAR PAY SCHEDULE I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT THOUGH SO I DON'T MAKE THAT STATEMENT. WITH THAT I A I AND I BY ALL MEANS UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED BUT I THINK GIVEN THAT THESE WORKERS ARE REPRESENTED IN THE UNIONS APPEAR TO HAVE COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT I'M WILLING TO MOVE THIS BILL. WE DO HAVE A MOTION FOR VICE CHAIR SECOND BY A SUMMER CARILLO. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE- COMMENTS ANY OTHER. I WANT TO THANK THE YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. PROUD AT DODGER STADIUM IS. IN THE HOME OF SIMPLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE I COME FRESH OFF THE FIELD AFTER A CURB STRIKE YESTERDAY THAT I GOT TO IT. IT SHOULD ITCH IN THE FIRST PITCH OF THE GAME AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACTUALLY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORKERS WHO MAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY BASEBALL GAME SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR FAMILIES. IN OUR DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PLAY A ROLE IN FACILITATING SOME OF THE VERY EARLY ON CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THE FOLKS AT THE TABLE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE. SO WITH THAT I'M I'M REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AND THAT THANK YOU FOR ALL THE COMMITMENT THAT'S BEEN DONE THE SENATOR AND I.

BUT ALSO SOME OF THE MANAGER FROM THE TEAM TO CLEAN THE GIANTS MAYS AND- UP TO GET MORE FEEDBACK MORE GET LITTLE MORE THE WEEDS AS TOP THE OPERATIONS AND- THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. ARE SO MANY EIGHT UNIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION. OF MEDIUMS MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO ME. UP TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOICE AND HAVE. THAT REPRESENTATION. BUT I THINK THEY'LL BE BELIEVE HE LANDED A PLACE THAT I THINK. IS FAIR. ALLOWS FOR A REASONABLE OPERATIONS. ALLOWS A WORKERS HAVE A VOICE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE.

THANKS FOR THAT PASSES THAT'LL BE HEADING FOR CONCURRENCE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND NOW WE HAVE UP ALSO TO BE ADOPTED THE FOR ACR ONE TWENTY FIVE FROM SUMMER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR CLARIFICATION. THESE ARE NOT GIANT COLORS WELL. NEED TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE REDUCE BIAS AND HELP EMPLOYERS FIND THE BEST SUITED CANDIDATES BASED ON OBJECTIVE FACTORS. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE IN MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF THE CORPORATE WORK FORCE FOR EXAMPLE. SILICON VALLEY TECH SECTOR MISTER CHAIR. JUST THREE POINT 3% OF EMPLOYEES ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN SIX POINT SIX ARE LATINO AND ONLY THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN ARE WOMEN. FURTHER A TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY WHITE APPLICANTS RECEIVED THIRTY SIX MORE CALL BACK FROM THEM THEM BLACK APPLICANTS AND HISPANIC. APPLICANTS WITH IDENTICAL RESUMES ACR WENT TO FIVE URGES POLICY MAKERS AND FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT TO EXPLORE WAYS TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT REDUCE BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION HIRING. HELP EMPLOYERS FIND THE BEST SUITED CANDIDATES BASED ON OBJECTIVE FACTORS AND HELP ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONS WHO SEEK OBTAIN AN HOLD EMPLOYMENT IN THIS STATE ARE ABLE TO DO SO FREE OF DISCRIMINATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YA VOTE. THANK YOU STRESS HI GREG HE'S HERE ON BEHALF OF MY METRICS. AND IT JUST WANNA POINT OUT A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL I WE ALL KNOW HIRING BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IS A HISTORIC PROBLEM AND IT HASN'T ABATED. THE CHALLENGE THAT MANY OF US ARE NOT AWARE OF ITS IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE INTERNET HAS TRANSFORMED HIRING WHERE AS AN HR MANAGER MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED. A DOZEN RESUMES ON THEIR DESK FOR PARTICULAR JOB THEY RECEIVE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS AND ACCORDING TO RESEARCH A- RESUME IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE WORST PREDICTORS OF A PERSON'S FUTURE JOB PERFORMANCE. IT YET IT IS ONE OF THE MOST OFTEN USED AND WE ALL KNOW WE CAN AVOID IT YOU LOOK AT A RESUME YOU LOOK AT NAMES YOU LOOK AT WHERE PEOPLE WENT TO COLLEGE IS THAT SAID DR AND YOU'RE MAKING JUDGMENTS ALREADY. SO AS TECHNOLOGY HAS EXACERBATED THAT PROBLEM THIS RESOLUTION POINTS OUT THAT TECHNOLOGY ALSO COULD HELP SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEM WITH THAT INHERENT BIAS BY OFFERING NEW INNOVATIVE SELECTION CRITERIA THAT LEVERAGES SCIENCE. TO TRY TO CREATE A BLIND HIRING PROCESS THE PROBLEM WITH HIRING. IS AT THE FRONT END OF THE FINAL I AM SURE EVERYBODY THIS. MANY IS A WHERE THE LAW PERMITS DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING IF YOU COULD HAVE A JOB JUSTIFICATION IT REQUIRES YOU TO USE. IN THE LIGHTS AS THE LEAST DISCRIMINATORY OPTION BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN CASE LOW OVER TIME IS THAT BURDENS BEEN PUT ON THE PLAINTIFF. AND SO THEREFORE WE'VE NOT MADE MUCH STRIDES IN THE LEAST DISCRIMINATORY OPTION WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S CODIFIED IN CASE LAW WHAT ALL THESE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES FOR JOB JUSTIFICATIONS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TRYING TO OPEN UP THE FINAL ON THE FRONT AND WITH THE NEW INNOVATIVE SELECTION CRITERIA. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S HI CONSIDERATION OF THIS. RESOLUTION WHICH HOPEFULLY IS THE BEGINNING OF WORK TOWARDS THAT END THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. ANY OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE SOME OF HIS OFFICE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY IT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY IS BY IS FREE AND I THINK THAT IT IT COULD VERY WELL CREATE NEW PROBLEMS I'M NOT SUPPORT OF EVERY PLACE SEEN AT HR DIRECTORS AN H. R. WORKERS WITH TECHNOLOGY. AT AYE AYE A. ONLY VOTING FOR BECAUSE I TRUST THE AUTHOR SO COMPLETELY AND KNOWING ALL THESE THINGS THAT I THINK ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT MAY COME OUT OF THIS HE WILL LOOK AT CLOSELY AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. TRADING ONE EVIL FOR ANOTHER. THAT AS OF MOTHER OF A CHILD WHOSE NAME IS TIARA ANY GOOD GONZALEZ HAMMOND'S AND IN NO WAY CAN. AS SHE WILL OFTEN REMIND ME. DESPITE HER GREAT CREDENTIALS SELDOM GETS PASSED THE FIRST LOOK ACTUALLY IN MANY AT. EVEN SERVICE SECTOR JOBS WHICH IS SHOCKING GIVEN HER HER RESUME BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S A REAL THING SO AT I AM GONNA GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT THIS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I AM I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ANY. FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS. THE OTHER COMMENT. WE HAVE HELLO THIS IS A MOTION ON CLIMATE HOPE OF A VICE CHAIR IS OUR SECOND SECOND SORRY. CREEL SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND I'LL JUST. TO US ARGUES OFFICES POINT FIRST OF ALL I THINK OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN. SILICON VALLEY I PRICE SPEAK MORE TO. HIRING DISPARITIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY KNOWS AFTER AMERICANS AND OF WOMEN. MORE VOCALLY PROBABLY THAN ALMOST ANYONE AND SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME. BEING IN SILICON VALLEY AND I THINK ALL OF US CERTAINLY ON THIS PANEL. ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE. BUT I DO SHARES A HEALTHY DOSE OF CYNICISM AS WELL AS TO WHETHER TECHNOLOGY IS THE IS THE SOLUTION TO IT. BUT I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE AND I THINK THAT THIS. IF THIS IF THIS IS A WAY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I THINK IT CAN BE A TOOL AGAIN I AGREE THAT WE DON'T NESTLE ONE OF DAYS OUT. A CERTAIN SECTOR OF EMPLOYMENT BUT IF THIS CAN BE A TOOL. TO HELP DEAL WITH ARE IMPLICIT BIASES. THAT'S WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT AND SOME BOX NATIVE IN THIS. AREA I IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF SOFTWARE BUT I DO ALSO SHARE SOME OF THE CYNICISM IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO DO IT BECAUSE THE INPUTS. ARE. STILL BEING PUT. QUITE IS DETERMINED. TO HAVE THOSE SAME BIASES AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE. AND I DEFTLY SUPPORT THE END GOAL OF WHAT THE REAL RESOLUTION IS SEEKING AND SO FOR THAT REASON I SUPPORT IT. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK AT. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. AND I NEED ALL OF THIS FEEDBACK EVERY LAST ONE TO ENSURE THAT. THIS WHAT OUR ALGORITHMS WE COME UP WITH WE A AYE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD DOESN'T TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THIS WAS ESPECIALLY SUPPOSED JUST BE A TOOL FOR HUMAN RESOURCE PEOPLE NOT TO REPLACE THEM THIS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP THEM. LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND HELP WITH THEIR IMPLICIT BIASES SO WEAKENED WEEDED OUT THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE BE ALL AND END ALL IS NOT THE ULTIMATE ANSWER IT IS JUST A TOOL TO SOMEONE CAN USE A TOOL BOX. TO GET THE MOST DIVERSE BOB CAN IT IS THAT THEY CAN'T IT WILL HELP THE INDUSTRY OR INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA ULTIMATELY A I ALSO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH. COLONEL JUSTICE AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FROM A RECORD AS SOON AS THEY SEE THAT THEY GET PHONE ADDRESS CAN'T AND WE NEVER GET TO STEP TWO AND THREE SO I HAVE OTHER. USES THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT. THIS DOES BECOME SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AS A TEASE COLONEL JUSTICE HIRING ALL OF THAT COULD BE VERY. THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT IN FOR THE NECOLE SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT LET'S LOOK ABOUT AS A DRINK LAST QUARTER CENTURY HASN'T WORKING. SO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO LOOK AT. LOOK AT MORE WELL THAT WE CAN DO. SO I THANK YOU SO MUCH AS EXCERPTED WILL PLEASE. MOTION IS BE ADOPTED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR KALRA. KALRA AYE FLORA FLORA I'D CREEL. CREO HI YEP. YEP I CAN SALAS GONZALEZ SIDE JONES SAWYER BY JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US THREE OF US I.
