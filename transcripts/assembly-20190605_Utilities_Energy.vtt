00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.857
LIABILITY WORK GROUP WHICH

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.059
INCLUDED MICHAEL KAHN PAGE --

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:22.994
NAVA.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.028
THE FUNDING MECHANISM GROUP

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.129
WHICH INCLUDED MYSELF AND

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:26.731
MICHAEL LARA.

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.065
ANY INSURANCE GROUP WHICH

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.367
INCLUDED DAVE JONES AND MICHAEL

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:31.436
WAR.

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:33.271
STAFF FROM OPR TOOK THESE THREE

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.806
SEPARATE PRODUCTS AND WROTE THE

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:36.207
DRAFT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY IN

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.843
ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THEM.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.012
THE FINAL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:43.147
POSTED LAST WEEK WERE NOT SEEN

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:45.349
BY ALL THE COMMISSIONERS UNTIL

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:45.983
THEY WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.351
PUBLIC.

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:48.753
SO THIS FRIDAY WILL BE OURFIRST

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.354
AND ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.390
DIRECT FEEDBACK WITH EACH OTHER

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:53.825
ON THE SUB RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.393
AS WELL AS GIVE FEEDBACK

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.394
REGARDING THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:57.795
AND HOW IT INTEGRATES THOSE

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:01.265
THREE CHAPTERS TOGETHER.

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.934
SO I'M NOW GOING TO DETAIL THE

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.035
DRAFT FINDINGS AND

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:06.304
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.206
AND MYSELF AND MISTER CONNOR

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.373
HERE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.675
QUESTIONS AROUND OUR SUBSECTIONS

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.910
AS WELL AS A REFERENCE ANY OTHER

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:14.979
MATERIAL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE.

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:17.048
SO OVERALL OUR FINDINGS HAVE

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:18.316
BEEN CONSISTENT.

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:19.717
WITH THE STRIKE TEAMS FINDINGS

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.018
THAT THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.854
INCREASES PLUS THE INCREASE IN

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.589
CALIFORNIA POPULATION.

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.790
HAVE PLAYED A DIRECT ROLE IN

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:27.258
FIRE THREAT.

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.726
SO INDEED THE INFORMATION WE

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.094
TOOK AND THAT SAY WE ARE IN THIS

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:32.330
NEW NORMAL.

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:34.031
WE ALSO FOUND THAT UTILITIES

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:35.733
HAVE PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.467
CAUSING THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.569
FIRES AND MUST TAKE A LEADERSHIP

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:42.440
ROLE IN MITIGATING RISK.

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:44.609
WE CONCLUDED THAT SB NINE OH ONE

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.544
DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO MANAGE THE

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:49.146
SYSTEMATIC RISK FROM WILDFIRES

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.449
TO THE STATE'S MAJOR UTILITIES.

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.017
AND THAT THE SOLUTIONS TO MORE

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:54.919
ACTIVELY ALLOCATE COSTS ARE MORE

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:56.287
BURDENSOME THE BIGGER THE

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:58.789
LIABILITY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.024
FOCUS ON MEDICATION.

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:01.325
AMONG ALL THE OTHER

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:05.096
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE.

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.197
AT A HIGH LEVEL THE

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.164
COMMISSIONERS ACROSS THE

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.066
SUBGROUPS RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.434
CURRENT STRICT LIABILITY

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.637
APPLICATION INVERSE CONDEMNATION

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:14.805
BE REPLACED.

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:15.873
WITH A FOUGHT BASE STANDARD.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.675
WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE CREATION

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:19.076
OF A WILDFIRE VICTIMS CLAIMS

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:21.145
PAYING FIND.

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:23.180
AS WELL AS A SERIES OF REFORMS

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.081
TO THE HOMEOWNER INSURANCE

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.417
MARKET TO MAINTAIN AVAILABLE AND

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.386
AFFORDABLE INSURANCE.

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:29.620
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAN

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.756
WORKING COORDINATION AND NONE

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:32.390
ARE DIRECT SUBSTITUTES FOR EACH

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:33.824
OTHER.

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.326
MOREOVER WE ACKNOWLEDGE TO

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:36.160
IMPLEMENTING ONE OR MORE OF

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:37.795
THESE CAN IMPACT THE NEED AND

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.263
THE SCOPE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.165
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:43.568
SOMEONE TO TAKE EACH SECTION IN

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.102
TURN THE THREE SUBGROUPS. FOR

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.605
THE LIABILITY WORKING GROUP

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:49.740
THERE ARE THREE KEY FINDINGS.

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.142
THE FIRST THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.577
DECENTRALIZING INCONSISTENT

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:54.445
SYSTEM OF REGULATING AND

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.914
GOVERNING UTILITY WILDFIRE

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:59.016
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION.

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.918
THE SECOND FINDING IS THAT THE

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.720
CURRENT APPLICATION OF INVERSE

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:03.821
CONDEMNATION AFFECTS THE

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.022
VIABILITY OF THE STATE'S

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.525
UTILITIES AND CUSTOMERS ACCESS

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:08.859
TO AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.828
AND WATER.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.229
THE THIRD IS THAT THE TIME

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.898
REQUIRED FOR AND THE UNCERTAINTY

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.701
OF WILDFIRE COST RECOVERY FROM

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.436
REPAIRS REDUCES INVESTOR

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:19.971
CONFIDENCE IN UTILITIES AND

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.607
LIMITS UTILITY ACCESS TO CAPITAL

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.108
AFTER MAJOR FIRE.

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.643
THE SAME FINDING WAS FOUND BY

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.812
THE FUN GROUP AS WELL.

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:29.146
SO THERE ARE THREE KEY

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:29.647
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:31.215
LIABILITY GROUP.

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:33.517
FIRST AS I MENTIONED REPLACE THE

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.986
INVERSE CONDEMNATION STRICT

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.587
LIABILITY STANDARD WITH A FAULT

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:37.855
BASED STANDARD [inaudible]

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.490
THE SECOND.

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.258
ESTABLISH AN ELECTRIC UTILITY

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.828
WILDFIRE BOARD TO GOVERN UTILITY

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.096
WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:48.432
MITIGATION IN A SINGLE ENTITY

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.101
SEPARATE FROM THE C. P. U. C..

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:52.336
AND THIRD THAT THE COST RECOVERY

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:54.005
STANDARD BE MODIFIED.

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:55.840
A FUN GROUP SPEAK SPECIFICALLY

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:56.874
TO HOW TO DO THIS IN OUR

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.610
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.379
NESTLE TURN TO THE FUNDING

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.780
MECHANISMS THAT FINDINGS AND

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.982
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.617
FIRST WE FOUND THAT THE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:08.352
FINANCIAL MECHANISMS FOR PAYING

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.887
FOR WILDFIRES ARE STREAMED AND

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.356
NOT SUSTAINABLE.

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.458
SECOND WILDFIRE RISK IS CREATED

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:15.926
BY MULTIPLE PARTIES WHO SHOULD

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.595
ALL BE INCENTIVIZE TO REDUCE THE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:19.797
RISK AND SHARE IN PAYING FOR

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:22.199
WILD FIRE DAMAGES.

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.934
THIRD CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:25.436
COSTS ARE INCREASING IN

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.304
PARTICULAR DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:29.407
WHILE FIRE MITIGATION.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.308
AND FOURTH THE LIABILITIES

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.910
ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES ARE

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.245
CHALLENGING TO MODEL AND NOT

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:38.015
WELL UNDERSTOOD.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.450
SO OUR SUBGROUP HAT TWO

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.218
CATEGORIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:44.622
THE FIRST IS ON COST RECOVERY.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.557
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST RECOVERY

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.992
THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE?

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.026
IS THAT GIVEN THE SIZE OF

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:51.395
POTENTIAL WILDFIRE LIABILITIES.

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.164
AND THE INABILITY OF THE UTILITY

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.732
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET TO

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:56.233
COVER THESE CLAIMS.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.501
UTILITIES WILL LIKE TO SEE MORE

00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:59.770
OBJECTIVE PREDICTABLE STANDARDS

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:00.871
FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES PRUDENT

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:03.607
BEHAVIOR.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:04.575
BECAUSE IF THEY EVEN GET ACTED

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.510
PRUDENTLY THE MOST COST CAN BE

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.612
RECOVERED FROM RATE PAYERS.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.147
THIS IS DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:11.749
GIVEN THE RELATIVE IN EXPERIENCE

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.417
WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.852
THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CAN

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.687
CONTRIBUTE TO WILDFIRE COST AND

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.089
DAMAGE.

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.657
HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT THERE

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.425
ARE REFORM OPTIONS THAT CAN

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:23.027
BETTER STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.930
THE LIKELIHOOD OF COST RECOVERY.

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.531
AND ENSURING RATE PAYERS ARE NOT

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:30.101
AUTOMATICALLY ON THE HOOK FOR

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.470
IMPRUDENTLY DERIVED COST.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.437
SO I SUB GROUP.

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:35.706
PROVIDED THREE OPTIONS FOR

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.208
REFORMING COST RECOVERY WHICH

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:39.376
ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:41.212
THE FIRST OPTION IS SHIFTING THE

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:43.614
BURDEN OF PROOF.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:46.183
AT OF IMPRUDENCE TO INTERVENE.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.585
THIS ALLOWS FOR PRESUMPTION OF

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.620
PRUDENCE FOR UTILITY WILDFIRE

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:50.387
EXPENSE.

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.156
BUT STILL ALLOWS CHALLENGERS TO

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.791
PROVE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:54.859
EVIDENCE.

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.360
THAT EXPENSE WAS IMPRUDENTLY

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.895
OCCURRED.

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:59.764
THIS IS THE STANDARD USED BY THE

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.565
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.067
COMMISSION.

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.368
I'LL NOTE THIS CHANGE IS NOT

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.569
INSIGNIFICANT.

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.104
AND IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.339
IS USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF COST

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.840
RECOVERY.

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.642
AS SUCH OF THIS THAT OPTION IS

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.778
PURSUED ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:14.945
TO ENSURETHAT INTERFERES HAVE

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:16.347
ACCESS TO THE RESOURCE AND DATA

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:18.849
THEY NEED. TO LAUNCH A

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.685
REASONABLE OFFENSE.

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:22.987
THE SECOND OPTION WE RECOMMEND

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.688
IS FURTHER REFINEMENT OF THESE

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:26.590
SB NINE A ONE FACTORS THAT THE

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:28.459
CPC SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:29.994
ASSESSING THIS ALLOWANCES. TO

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.796
GIVE A HIGHER WAITING TO THOSE

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:33.130
FACTORS THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:34.331
UNIQUE EXHAUSTION A

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.901
CIRCUMSTANCES POSSIBLY PRESENT

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:39.136
IN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. FOR

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:42.239
EXAMPLE EXTREME WEATHER.

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.641
AND IN OUR THIRD OPTION.

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.109
IS ONE THAT PROPOSES A

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.044
PREDETERMINED MAXIMUM LIABILITY

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.346
BE SET.

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.748
REGARDING -- SHAREHOLDER

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.683
LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.485
CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE.

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:55.853
THIS PRE DETERMINED MAXIMUM

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.223
LIABILITY WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.559
IN CONJUNCTION WITH A WILDFIRE

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.126
VICTIMS FINE.

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:03.160
WHERE YOU CHIU UTILITY

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.461
SHAREHOLDERS HAVE MADE A

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:06.330
SUBSTANTIAL UP FRONT

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:08.732
CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIND?

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.167
SETTING THIS UP PREDETERMINED

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:11.936
LEVEL FOR MAXIMUM LIABILITY

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.470
COULD BE TIED TO A VARIETY OF

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:14.872
METRICS SUCH AS MARKET

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:17.708
CAPITALIZATION AND THAT IT COME.

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.476
I KNOW THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.778
THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN ABSOLUTE

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.713
CAP ON SHAREHOLDER EXPOSURE TO

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.649
LIABILITIES.

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:26.750
THE SECOND SET OF

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:27.918
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.520
WILDFIRE FROM GROUP NOT

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.956
SURPRISING THE WELFARE FUND.

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.724
I SO OVERALL WE PROPOSE A

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.593
WILDFIRE VICTIMS FUN THAT WOULD

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.695
BE APPLICABLE TO UTILITY COST

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:39.496
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.432
A FUND THAT IS BROADLY SOURCED

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:42.633
INCLUDING FUNDING FROM

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.401
SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.403
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.605
SUCH A FUN WOULD SUPPORT

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.573
LIQUIDITY AND CREATE A BUFFER

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.975
AGAINST THE SHOCK OF LIABILITY

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:53.043
COSTS FROM CATASTROPHIC FIRES

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.246
FOR ANYONE GROUP.

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:57.214
THIS RECOMMENDATION SUBCHAPTER

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.382
HAS A LOT OF DETAIL IN IT BUT

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.717
I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:02.219
THAT DETAIL AT A HIGH LEVEL.

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.121
THE SUB GROUP RECOMMENDS THAT

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.990
THE PARTICIPATION BE VOLUNTARY

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:07.324
FOR INVESTOR OWNED AND PUBLICLY

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:08.993
OWNED UTILITIES.

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:09.860
AND THAT THE FUNDING BE

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.629
SUFFICIENTLY CAPITALIZED TO

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:14.164
SURVIVE ANTICIPATED THIRD PARTY

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:14.798
DAMAGES.

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:17.434
UNDER A HIGHER EXPECTATION RISK

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:20.137
FIRE SCENARIO.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.505
AND THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.440
THE FUND BE SOURCED BOB BROADLY

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.376
FROM CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:27.211
SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS -- AND

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:28.879
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.447
AND PARTICULAR THAT THOSE

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:32.049
CONTRIBUTIONS BE TIED TO ACTUAL

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.817
RAIL BRISK SO THOSE UTILITIES

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.452
THAT HAVE GREATER RISK FOR

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.955
WILDFIRES WOULD PAY MORE.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:39.156
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE FUND BE

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.424
CLAIMS PAYING.

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.359
AND PAY UP TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.862
FOR FIRE AND PER UTILITY.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.430
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE FUND

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.564
SHOULD PAY CLAIMS WHEN THE

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.633
UTILITY IS FOUND TO BE IMPRUDENT

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.435
SO THAT WHILE FIRE VICTIMS GET

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:52.670
PAID QUICKLY.

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.171
BUT THAT A SPECIFIED AMOUNT WE

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.373
GET REPAID BY THE UTILITY IF IT

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.609
IS AN PRUDENT.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.177
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE FUN LAST

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.845
AS LONG AS NECESSARY AND SHOULD

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.714
BE REEVALUATED EVERY FIVE TO TEN

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.382
YEARS.

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:06.517
AND IF IS THE SIDE OF THE FUND

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.851
IS NO LONGER NEEDED THAT THERE

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:10.287
BE A PLAN TO WIND DOWN THE FIND.

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.523
AND RETURN UNUSED CAPITAL TO ALL

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.959
THE CONTRIBUTORS.

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.327
OUR WORK GROUP HIGHLIGHTED

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.595
SEVERAL CHALLENGES ESTABLISHING

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:19.830
A FIND.

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:23.033
AND I'LL JUST LIST THESE. ONE ON

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.201
ONE CHALLENGE OF THE FUN IS THAT

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.235
IN NOT PERVERSE LEE --

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.338
INCENTIVIZE RISKY BEHAVIOR BY

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:28.605
UTILITIES AND HOMEOWNERS.

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:30.107
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.408
THAT PEOPLE GO OUT THERE AND GET

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.843
ADEQUATE INSURANCE THAT

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.245
UTILITIES DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.647
TO AVOID.

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.448
FIRES.

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.216
HAVING THE PRESENCE OF A

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.884
GUARANTEED FUNDING SOURCE CAN

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:44.888
CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE AND

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.123
WE NEED TO WORK AROUND THAT.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.424
THE SECOND IS AGAIN THE

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:47.992
POTENTIAL FOR CLAIMS TO GET

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:49.493
INFLATED GIVEN THAT THERE'S

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.862
GUARANTEED FUNDING.

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.564
A THIRD CHALLENGES WITH SOURCING

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.032
THE FUND INITIALLY AND

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.667
PARTICULAR HOW TO GET

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:59.670
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM P. JEANNIE.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.270
AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF A

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:01.905
BANKRUPTCY.

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:02.873
THERE'S ALSO A CHALLENGE WITH

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.009
MAINTAINING PAY OUTS AT CURRENT

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:08.912
SETTLEMENT VALUES -- CURRENTLY

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.681
WILDFIRE AT VICTIMS INSURANCE

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.483
COMPANIES WILL GET A CERTAIN

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:14.318
PERCENTAGE ON THE DOLLAR WHEN

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.120
THEY SETTLED IN COURT WITH THE

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.221
UTILITIES.

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:18.689
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN SIMILAR

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:21.425
LEVELS WITH THE FIND?

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:21.992
AND THEN THERE'S THE OVERALL

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.194
COURSE TURN ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.663
FOR ASKING PROPERTY OWNERS AND

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.365
REPAIRS TO CONTRIBUTE TO FIND.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:29.233
HOW DOES THAT?

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.568
AFFECT THEM A FINANCIALLY.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:32.770
IN OUR PROCESS WE DO NOT GET

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.405
CLEAR INPUT ABOUT HOW TO

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:35.572
LEGISLATE OR DIRECTLY DEAL WITH

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.107
THESE CHALLENGES AND SO WE

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:37.975
WANTED TO RAISE THEM TO YOUR

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.410
ATTENTION AS WELL AS THE

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.778
ATTENTION OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:43.313
SO THEY CAN BRING A PROPOSALS TO

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:43.981
YOU THAT ADDRESS THESE

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:44.815
CHALLENGES.

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.383
IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS ALL THESE

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.317
CHALLENGES THAT HAS THE

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.086
POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE NEEDED

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:50.621
SIZE OF A FIND.

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:54.058
WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS AS WELL.

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:55.292
AND THE FINALLY OUR WORKGROUP.

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.094
NOTED THAT ABSENT CREATION OF A

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:59.296
VICTIMS PAYING FIND REVISING THE

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.998
COST RECOVERY STANDARD AND

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.766
ESTABLISHING A LIQUIDITY FINE

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.168
CAN'T PROVIDE BENEFITS.

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.402
ALBEIT NOT THE BENEFITS A

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:09.073
BROADER COST SOCIALIZATION.

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.974
FINALLY WE ALSO COMMENTED ON THE

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.743
C. P. U. C. FINE AUTHORITY.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.211
AND RE I RECOMMEND REVIEWING

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:15.813
THEIR FINEST ALREADY TO ISSUE

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.481
FINES FOR ANY VIOLATIONS AND

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.216
ALTERING THE DISPOSITION OF THAT

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.652
FINE REVENUE TO THE WILDFIRE

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:22.953
VICTIMS FINE OR TOWARDS

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.922
MITIGATION EFFORTS.

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.223
AND THEN FINALLY OUR LAST

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.224
CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEAL

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.526
WITH INSURANCE.

00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:31.128
THE INSURANCE SUB GROUP FOUND

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:33.097
THAT HOME INSURANCE IS BECOMING

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:34.631
MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.867
EXPENSIVE TO TEEN AND HIGH WILD

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.769
FIRE RISK AREAS.

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.604
RELATEDLY MORE HOMEOWNERS ARE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:41.939
HAVING TO PURCHASE FIRE

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:44.241
INSURANCE FROM THE SURPLUS LINES

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.876
MARKET OR FROM THE FAIR PLAN.

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.111
WHICH IS THE STATE'S FIRE

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:49.580
INSURANCE PLAN.

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:50.481
THE HOME INSURANCE MARKET IN

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.916
CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN CRISIS YET

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:54.351
AND AS SUCH THE GROUP DOES NOT

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.886
RECOMMEND A NEW GOVERNMENT

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:57.488
CREATED INSURANCE PROGRAM BEYOND

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.089
THE FAIR PLAN.

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:01.458
HOWEVER THE MARKET IS ON A PATH

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:02.493
TOWARD BECOMING LESS AFFORDABLE

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:04.394
AND AVAILABLE.

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:05.796
THIS SUB GROUP RECOMMENDS MANY

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:08.098
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.233
AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM IN

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.935
TURN. ONE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.804
CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN INCENTIVES

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:15.706
AT THE RISK BASE PRICING OF

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:17.808
INSURANCE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.710
NEXT IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.044
PLAN AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.614
INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.150
BY INCREASING THE CLAIMS CAP.

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:28.485
THIRD REQUIRE FIRE RISK

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:30.287
UNDERWRITING MODELS USE BIND

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:32.756
SHORES TO BE FILED IN APPROVED

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.124
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE.

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.426
AND REQUIRE ANNUAL FILING WITH

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.595
CDI FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.898
THE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATING

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.466
MODELS AND TOOLS.

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:43.967
I'LL SAY MANY OF THESE ON

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.802
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ECHOED IN

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:46.470
THE COMMENTS WE HEARD IN THE

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:48.138
WILD FIRE VICTIMS ABOUT SOME OF

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:49.840
THE CHALLENGES THEY SAW WITH

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.643
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES A POST

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.845
FIRES.

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:55.879
THE NEXT RECOMMENDATIONS THE SET

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.347
HOME FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.815
COMMUNITY RISK REDUCTION

00:46:58.882 --> 00:46:59.783
STANDARDS.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.219
OR REQUIRE INSURERS uIMPLEMENT

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:04.655
A TIERED MITIGATION CREDIT BASED

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:05.923
ON THE LEVEL OF HOME HARDENING.

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.558
BASICALLY GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.760
SECURING HARDENING THEIR HOME

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:12.162
AGAINST WILDFIRES.

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.497
ALSO REQUIRE INSURERS TO

OVERALL POLICIES THAT ARE HERE.

BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:42.239
RATE PAYERS AND VICTIMS.

COMPENSATION AS YOU SEE IT.

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:18.141
WILL BE ADEQUATE AND SUFFICIENT

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:18.442
[inaudible]

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:21.178
WHAT?

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.848
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.116
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD REFLECT

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:28.685
ALONG THIS PROCESS IS THAT.

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.053
THERE IS THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.154
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WILD

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.456
FIRE VICTIMS ARE ALSO RATE

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:34.524
PAYERS AND THEIR PROPERTY OWNERS

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:34.958
AND SOME OF THEM ARE

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.193
SHAREHOLDERS.

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.527
AND WANTING TO ULTIMATELY BE

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:39.896
FAIR TO CALIFORNIANS IS

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:40.430
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:44.201
FOCUSED ON AND THE A I WAS SANTA

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.036
TALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.771
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.773
THEY INCLUDE COMPONENTS THAT

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.541
MAKE SURE THAT UTILITY

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:54.311
SHAREHOLDERS AND UTILITIES ARE

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:55.545
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.013
BOTH EXPECTATIONS FOR UTILITY

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.381
MANAGEMENT.

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:01.418
AND SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AROUND.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:02.886
PRUDENT BEHAVIOR.

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.221
AND MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.889
ARE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED IN

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.257
PRUDENT BEHAVIOR.

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.625
THAT IS THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:10.460
THE SHAREHOLDERS THAT BEAR MUCH

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.562
OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:14.331
NOW THAT BEING SAID IT IS THE

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:17.634
RESPONSIBILITY OF RATE PAYERS TO

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.569
FIND THE SYSTEM THAT IS HEALTHY

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.104
AND STRONG.

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.173
AND A BIG PART OF THAT IN THIS

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.574
NEW NORMAL WITH WILDFIRES.

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.610
IS FUNDING INVESTMENTS AND WHILE

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.044
FIRE MITIGATION.

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:29.813
AND ALSO AT TIMES ABSORBING SOME

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.582
OF THE COST WHEN THERE IS A FIRE

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.783
ON THE SYSTEM.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:34.951
THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:37.087
WE RECOMMEND -- TO REDUCE THE

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.955
COSTS TO RATEPAYERS AND WHILE

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:40.423
FIRE VICTIMS.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.858
WHEN IT COMES TO REDUCING THE

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:42.859
COST?

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:45.128
RATEPAYERS.

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.563
MISTER KHAN CAN SPEAK TO THIS

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.965
BUT THE RECOMMENDATION TO REFORM

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.967
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:53.103
IT'S PARTLY DRIVEN BY THE FACT

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.704
THAT ABSENT REFORM IN THAT AREA

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.740
THOSE COSTS FALL TO SHAREHOLDERS

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:58.141
IN RATE PAYERS.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.476
AND REFORM TO A FAULT BASED

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:02.078
STANDARD ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THOSE

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.347
ARE COST THAT CAN BE BROADLY

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.448
SOCIALIZED ACROSS ALL

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:06.750
CALIFORNIANS ACROSS ALL

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:09.085
TAXPAYERS.

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:10.987
THE PROPOSAL OF A FIND IS

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:12.689
FOCUSED ON GIVEN INVERSE

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.391
CONDEMNATION AND THE FACT THAT

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:15.859
THE COST.

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.294
OTHERWISE DEFAULT TO

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.995
SHAREHOLDERS AND RATE PAYERS CAN

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:21.898
YOU MORE BROADLY SOCIALIZES COST.

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.199
AND SO WHEN YOU CREATE A FINE

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.468
YOU SOCIALIZE THOSE COST AS WELL

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:26.937
TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHO LIVE IN

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.672
THESE AREAS AS WELL AS SOME

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.907
COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE STATE WE

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:32.576
RECOMMEND SPECIFICALLY THAT.

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:33.610
A FUND BE SET UP AS A TAX EXEMPT

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:35.011
ORGANIZATION.

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:36.279
AND SO THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.847
TO SOME OF THAT LOST A TAX

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.783
REVENUE.

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:41.718
THE FUND IDEA WE PROPOSED

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.320
GENERALLY AND I'LL SAY MORE

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.721
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I'VE HEARD

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:46.856
HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON REPAIR

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:49.859
NEUTRALITY -- SO WE RECOMMEND

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:52.062
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE RATE PAYER

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.530
CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIND BE

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.531
SIMILAR.

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:55.699
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.601
RESOURCES CHARGE THAT REPAIRS

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.603
CURRENTLY PAY FOR POWER KAMALA

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:02.606
TRICITY CRISIS WHICH IS DUE.

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.574
TO A AND NEXT YEAR AND SO IF

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.576
REPLACE THAT BOND WITH A SIMILAR

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.578
SIZE BOND.

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:09.613
RATE PAYERS SHOULD BE.

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:12.248
NEUTRAL TO THE IMPACT OF A FUN.

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:14.951
AND THEN YOU SUPPLEMENT THAT

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.320
WITH OTHER FUNDING.

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:18.655
AS IT RELATES THE FAMOUS FOR

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:19.489
WILD FIRE VICTIMS MAN I THINK

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:20.390
FIRST AND FOREMOST THE MOST

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:21.257
IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS AS MUCH

00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:22.859
MEDICATION AS POSSIBLE.

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:25.028
SO THAT THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:26.363
GET SMALLER AND SMALLER.

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:29.199
BUT WHAT A FINE DOES IS ALLOW

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:31.067
FOR QUICKER PAYMENTS. TO THOSE

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:33.436
WHILE FIRE VICTIMS -- THAT HAS

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:34.671
BEEN A CHALLENGE HISTORICALLY

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.540
WHAT WE HEARD FROM WHILE FIRE

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.009
VICTIMS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS.

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.210
WAS THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:43.179
BENEFITS OF HAVING INVERSE

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:44.514
CONDEMNATION AS IT CURRENTLY IS

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.383
IS THAT THE UTILITIES MORE

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.984
QUICKLY COME TO THE TABLE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.352
SERVICE SETTLING CLAIMS.

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:50.153
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WHILE

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.489
FIRE VICTIMS TO GET PAID QUICKLY

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:53.490
BECAUSE THEY ALTERNATE LIVING

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:55.058
EXPENSES THEY GET FROM INSURANCE

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.259
COMPANIES.%

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:57.761
AND WITHIN A TWO YEAR PERIOD.

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:59.496
SO SOME OF THE WHAT WE PROPOSE

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.464
IS ABOUT GETTING WHILE FIRE

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.766
VICTIMS PAID QUICKLY.

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:06.002
BEFORE THEIR SET A PRUDENT SEE

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:08.071
DETERMINATION.

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.272
SO I'LL STOP THERE BUT I THINK

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.674
EVEN SENSITIVE AT TO BOTH OF

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.576
THOSE GROUPS.

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.110
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND.

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:15.278
I'D.

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.246
IT'S NOT NECESSARY IF YOU WHAT

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.480
IF YOUIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AYE

00:55:17.547 --> 00:55:19.315
THAT'S FINE.

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:22.919
IT WOULD HELP CERT CERTAINLY --

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.054
WHAT THANK YOU HI?

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.488
I IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.389
ABOUT VICTIMS ARE WHAT WE TRIED

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:28.358
TO DO WAS DETERMINE HOW VICTIMS

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:28.758
ARE TREATED NOW.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:29.926
AND THE EFFECT ON VICTIMS OF THE

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.895
CURRENT SITUATION AND WHAT WE

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:34.397
LEARNED WAS THAT.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:35.765
UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.834
VICTIMS ARE TERRIBLY COMPROMISED

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.403
BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE EITHER

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.038
BANKRUPT OR THREATENING TO GO

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:42.806
BANKRUPT.

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.174
SO THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.677
VICTIMS ONE KIND OF VICTIM IS

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.812
THE CASUALTY VICTIM IT'S THE

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.647
PERSON WHO LOST THEIR LIFE IT'S

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:52.048
THE PERSON IS NOT COVERED BY

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.349
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.652
THAT PERSON IN THE ABSENCE OF

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.287
THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY WOULD

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:58.955
HAVE FULL RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT

00:55:59.022 --> 00:55:59.756
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:02.125
HAVE A JURY WOULD BE VINDICATED.

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.662
BUT BECAUSE INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:06.963
HAD THE RESULT OF FORCING P.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.098
JEANNIE TO BANKRUPTCY THE

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.532
CASUALLY VICTIMS HAVE ALL BEEN

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:12.669
LUMPED IN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE SO

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:14.204
ONE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE OF

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.439
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WE LEARNED.

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.241
AT ALL I'M DOING IS REFLECTING

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.209
WHAT WE LEARNED THIS IS JUST

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:20.744
THIS IS AN OPINION THIS IS THE

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.712
TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE ONE PIECE

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:23.713
OF EVIDENCE IS.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.915
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS VERY

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.517
HARMFUL TO CASUAL THE VICTIMS

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.986
BECAUSE IT THROWS THE UTILITY IN

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:32.055
A BANKRUPTCY AND ELIMINATES OR

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:33.256
SEPARATE RIGHTS.

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:36.092
AS TO THE PROPERTY DAMAGE

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.261
VICTIMS THE PEOPLE WHO GET AYE

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.663
RECOVER ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE OF

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.399
INVERSE WHAT WE LEARNED IS TWO

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:44.167
THINGS.

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.735
PREJUDICE THEM ONE IS IN THE

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.737
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE A PROPERTY

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:49.939
DAMAGE VICTIM IN THE CASE OF

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.441
NEGLIGENCE WOULD HAVE AN

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:52.442
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A JURY WOULD

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:53.476
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF THE

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:54.844
RIGHTS VINDICATED.

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.546
BUT RATHER THAN THAT HAPPENING

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.081
THEY ARE THROWN INTO BANKRUPTCY

00:56:58.148 --> 00:56:59.916
AND AGAIN THEIR RIGHTS ARE

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:02.018
PREJUDICED MORE OVER AND THIS IS

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:04.053
THE REALLY BAD EFFECTIVELY PGD

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.892
BANKRUPTCY.

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.160
IF THERE ARE FIRES.

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.261
AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY THERE'S A

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:11.895
PROCESS IN THE BANKRUPTCY THAT

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.429
SUBORDINATES THE CLAIMS OF THE

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.498
PROPERTY DAMAGE VICTIMS SO WHAT

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.167
WE LEARNED WAS.

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.735
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.870
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS TERRIBLY

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:23.840
PREJUDICIAL TO THE VICTIMS ON

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.775
BOTH ACCOUNTS OF THE VICTIMS AND

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:27.277
THE PROPERTY VICTIMS.

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.445
OF AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:32.182
WHY WE THOUGHT THAT.

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:32.615
CHANGING THE INVERSE

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:35.018
CONDEMNATION WOULD BE MORE FAIR.

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:37.987
IN TERMS OF THE RATE PAYERS.

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:39.889
WHAT WE LEARNED WAS UNDER THE

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:42.492
STRESS TEST THE WAY THAT NINE A

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.128
ONE WORKS THE CURRENT SYSTEM?

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.663
DEFAULTS TO THE RATE PAYER

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:47.831
PAYING.

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:50.166
SO I KNOW AND AND YOU SHOULD

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.402
UNDERSTAND NONE OF US ARE

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:53.002
POLITICIANS.

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.437
MARY YOUR CONSULTANT COULD TELL

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:58.808
YOU OF MY EXPERIENCE HERE.

00:57:58.875 --> 00:57:59.876
IS IT BY AYE MY FIRST COMMISSION

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:02.078
WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO -- I'VE HAD

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:02.812
MANY COMMISSIONS IN MANY

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:03.580
DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS BUT I'M

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.181
I'M NOT A POLITICIAN.

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:06.616
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.785
PART OF IT ALL WE KNOW IS THE

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.186
FACT THAT WE WERE TOLD.

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:12.789
AND THE FACTS WE WERE TOLD OUR

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.791
THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:17.460
ONCE THE UTILITIES ARE BANKRUPT

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:20.029
AND GONE OR WORSE.

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.731
IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC THE

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:23.533
PUBLIC UTILITIES ALL TALK ABOUT

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.435
THE REPAIRS ARE ON THE HOOK THE

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.670
CURRENT SITUATION IS REALLY.

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:29.539
A DAMAGE TO THE RATE PAYERS AND

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:31.074
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU IN

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.244
THE CONTEXT WE HAVE.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.845
FIFTY SIX PUBLIC UTILITIES THAT

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.447
MEET YOU CALL THEM UNITS AND WE

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.948
HAVE THREE THOUSAND WATER

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:39.883
COMPANIES.

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:42.452
THOSE FIFTY SIX PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.487
ARE THE RATE PAYERS THEY HAVE NO

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:46.756
SHAREHOLDERS THE EFFECT OF

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:49.425
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS THAT

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.361
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU TILT

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.662
THEIR UTILITY LET'S TAKES MUD

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:53.663
SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE.

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.100
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SMOG DOES

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.735
ANYTHING WRONG.

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.270
THE EFFECT IS THE RATE PAYERS

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:00.703
PAY.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:02.538
SO WE HEARD TESTIMONY AND WE

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.307
HAVE WILL PASS IT ON TO YOU OUT

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.276
WE HAVE LUMINOUS TESTIMONY THAT

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.777
THE RATE PAYERS OF THE STATE

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.479
ALREADY ENORMOUSLY BURDENS

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:11.080
THEY'RE KIND OF UP TO IT.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.916
WE GOT IT FROM THE ARE THE

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.784
CONSUMERS WE GOT IT FROM THE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.153
COMMERCIAL RATE PAYERS BUT IN

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.022
ANSWER TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION.

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.324
ASSEMBLYMAN PATTERSON THE WHAT

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:24.360
WE LEARNED WAS THE IF IMPACT OF

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:26.763
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WAS.

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.264
TERRIBLY THREATENING THE RATE

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.066
PAYERS THEY ARE WE'RE GOING TO

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.067
PAY.

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:34.037
OUT FOR ALL OF THIS IN THE CASE

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:36.406
OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES AND THE

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.608
WATER COMPANIES THERE IS NO

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:41.244
SALVATION FOR THEM THEY THEY'VE

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:42.145
COME TO US AND SAID THAT THEIR

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:43.313
FAITH AND THIS IS IN A REPORT.

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:44.514
THEY ARE THREATEN THEIR

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.316
EXISTENCE IS THREATENED.

00:59:46.382 --> 00:59:47.850
IN THE CASE OF THE THREE I'LL

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:51.154
USE THE STRATEGY OF THE I. O.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.389
USE THE P. YOU SEE AND NINE A

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.725
ONE IS TO SHIFT.

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:59.562
THE COST OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.030
TO THE RATE PAYERS AFTER A

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.299
CERTAIN AMOUNT SO THE QUESTION

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.803
IS WE FACED IS WHAT COULD WE DO

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:07.370
ABOUT IT.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.872
AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S TWO

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.274
THINGS TO DO ABOUT IT EITHER TO

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.575
FIGURE OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE THE

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:15.078
SHIFTED.

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.679
<u>HICH WE COULD DO [inaudible]</u>

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.314
FOR TO ELIMINATED.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.783
ON THE LIABILITY BUT THE CURRENT

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.853
STATE OF AFFAIRS.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.355
UNLESS IT'S REMEDY EITHER THAT

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.522
THE EFFECT OF THE CAUSE IS

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.091
TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES TO THE

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:29.025
VICTIMS.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.626
AND THE RATE PAYERS THERE ARE

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:35.164
OTHER PEOPLE TOO BUT YOU ASKED

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:35.765
THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER YOUR

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.034
QUESTION.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.902
AMERICAN ONE OTHER POINT SIR --

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.170
THAT MISTER KHAN THAT REMIND ME

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:41.637
OF WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:41.938
BANKRUPTCY.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.206
WHICH IS.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.441
UNDER THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:46.242
AS MISTER KHAN NOTED THE

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.176
COMBINATION OF INVERSE

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.278
CONDEMNATION AS WELL AS HOW COST

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.881
RECOVERY IS PURSUED IS VIEWED BY

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.683
INVESTORS AND RATING AGENCIES AS

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.284
VERY RISKY.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.986
AND SO THEY HAVE DOWNGRADED

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.022
SEVERAL OF OUR UTILITIES AND

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.456
THEY HAVE SAID THAT THERE AREN'T

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.858
THERE ARE NO REFORMS THEY WILL

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:03.393
DOWNGRADE THEM SOME MORE.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:04.427
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.561
BANKRUPTCY TO HAVE THOSE

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:08.131
DOWNGRADES ACTUALLY COST REPAIRS.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.999
WHAT WE HEARD IN TESTIMONY WAS

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:12.468
THAT IF THE COST OF CAPITAL COST

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.170
OF DATA IS INCREASED 1% AND THEN

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.172
IT'S COUPLED WITH A 3% INCREASE

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.206
IN THE COST OF EQUITY?

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:20.209
THAT RAISES RATES NEARLY 7% FOR

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.178
RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S WITHOUT

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.113
DOING ANYTHING WE ALSO HEARD

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.885
FROM SMUD THAT EVEN GOING DOWN

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.520
FROM A DOUBLE A RATING. ONE

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.320
NOTCH CAN COST THEM A HUNDRED

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:31.854
MILLION DOLLARS EXTRA IN

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.423
SERVICING THAT AND THAT'S WHY

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:36.125
ARE BIG TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.661
STATUS QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.930
UP WITH THE GOVERNOR.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.900
AND YOUR GROUP ISSUED -- A

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.935
STATEMENT ABOUT THIS AND I WANT

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:46.702
TO QUOTE.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.671
FROM THE PARAGRAPH.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.440
WE WILL PURSUE LEGISLATION TO

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:53.242
TACKLE THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:54.410
TO PROVIDE CERTAIN THE

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:55.611
ACCOUNTABILITY WE WILL SEEK

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.113
EQUITABLE RESOLUTION ON THE

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.548
PRUDENT MANAGER.

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:01.551
STANDARD BRIDGE FINANCING AND TO

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.752
ALLOW COST RECOVERY FOR

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.987
ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS WHO ACT

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.422
RESPONSIBLY AND THE PUBLIC'S

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:09.158
BEST INTEREST CAN YOU GIVE US.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.861
A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE KIND

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.830
OF LEGISLATION THAT.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.565
YOU MAY BE SUGGESTING.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.033
WELL SIR THAT WAS NOT FROM OUR

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.167
GROUP -- THAT WAS FROM THE

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.336
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.872
SENT AN ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP BUT

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.474
I THINK CONSUME WITHIN.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.775
WITHIN OUR REPORT YOU CAN FIND

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.810
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.545
WOULD SUPPORT THAT DIRECTION.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.047
SO IN YOUR REPORT YOU HAVE

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.148
SUGGESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.383
LEGISLATION OR BASICALLY IN

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.918
IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT LEGISLATION

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.453
MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.554
WE HAVE A COMBINATION

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.223
IMPLICATIONS AS WELL AS ELEMENTS

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:41.991
THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.426
INCLUDE IN LEGISLATION.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.594
I THINK ONE OF THE THE KEY

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.295
POINTS TO RAISE IS THAT IS GOING

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:46.829
TO TAKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.798
STAKEHOLDERS COMING TOGETHER TO

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.233
MAKE THE SOLUTIONS WORK

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.968
AND SO OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO BE

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.970
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.371
OBJECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATION TO

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.874
BE WATER SOME THIRD RAILS TO

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.343
AVOID BUT THEN PROVIDE YOU AND

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.244
THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.812
PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROCESS AND

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:03.312
YOUR PROCESS.

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.280
WITH INFORMATION TO COME

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.516
TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY PUT PEN TO

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.618
PAPER OKAY WE VIEW THIS AS WE

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:12.588
WORK FOR YOU AND SO OUR JOB WAS.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:13.156
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FACTS

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.056
WERE.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:16.893
AND TO IDENTIFY THINGS THAT

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.427
COULD BE DONE.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:21.697
BUT WE DIDN'T PRESUME TO SUGGEST.

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:23.966
OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S THE NIGHT A

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:28.638
ONE SWEATSHIRT ONE FINAL AND

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:31.507
FINAL I KNOW I C. PUSHING THE

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:35.144
BUTTON.

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.145
YOU'RE VERY KIND.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:38.381
DID YOU APPROACH.

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:39.215
WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW NEW

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.883
NORMAL EXPLOSIVE FIRES THAT ARE

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:44.787
pDID YOU APPROACH ANY TESTIMONY

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.389
INFORMATION OR DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.759
KIND OF DAUGHTER RECOMMENDATIONS

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.060
WITH RESPECT.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.828
TO WHAT.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:55.998
UP CALIFORNIA CAL FIRE.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.301
NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WITH RESPECT

01:03:58.367 --> 01:03:59.835
TO FIRE FIGHTING.

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.804
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.272
REAL CAPACITY ISSUES HERE.

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.774
THAT THERE ARE REAL PRE

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.642
POSITIONING ISSUES THERE'S REAL

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.811
QUESTIONS ABOUT ADEQUATE

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.846
PERSONNEL ADEQUATE TRUCKS

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.448
ADEQUATE AVIATION.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.051
AND THE LIKE IT SO IT SEEMS TO

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.619
ME LIKE WE ARE SORT OF IN.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.054
IN A WORLD WAR TWO MODE AND WE

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.456
SORT OF NEED A MARSHALL PLAN.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.791
FOR FIGHTING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.759
THIS VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.027
THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.129
IN TIMES PAST HAVE YOU TOUCHED

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.098
ON THAT IN ANY OF THIS.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.366
WE HAVE NOT WE FOLLOW THE

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.867
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION TO FOCUS

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:34.570
ON COST AND THERE IS A LOT TO

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.705
COVER WITHIN THAT TOPIC.

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.340
I I DISAGREE WITH THAT I'M SORRY --

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.942
I THINK WE HAVE IN IN OUR

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.544
SECTION IN THIS WAY.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.112
AND YOUR SECTION NEWARK WHICH OF

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:44.080
THE REPORT.

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:44.914
IT'S RETURN TO THE LIABILITY SIX

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.617
OKAY WE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING.

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.685
FIRST OF ALL WE GOT JUST SO YOU

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.454
UNDERSTAND WE GOT TREMENDOUS

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.455
AMOUNT OF TESTIMONY WHICH

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.023
CORROBORATES WHAT YOU JUST SAID

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.325
AND WE WILL PASS IT ON TO YOU.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.560
THAT WE ARE RESOURCE.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.428
STARVED AND WE NEED TO

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.430
COORDINATE BUT HERE IS WHERE I

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.165
DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.102
WE FOUND OUT THAT ALL FIFTY SIX

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.137
PUBLIC UTILITIES HAVE THEIR OWN

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:12.041
WAY OF DOING THINGS AND THE I

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.143
USE THREE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.578
PRIVATE UTILITIES HAVE THEIR WAY

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:16.512
OF DOING THINGS.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.714
AND WE CONCLUDED THAT WHAT

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.116
SHOULD HAPPEN IS THEY SHOULD

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.218
THERE SHOULD BE A WILDFIRE BOARD

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:24.787
WHICH COORDINATES ALL OF THE

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.555
ACTIVITIES OF THE TELE THESE

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.024
WITH RESPECT WILD FIRES.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.525
BECAUSE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.327
AMOUNT OF REDUNDANCY AND THERE'S

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.762
A TREMENDOUS THAT PEOPLE DO THE

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.096
SAME THING IN DIFFERENT ARE

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:36.432
JURISDICTIONS AND ALSO THIS

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:36.799
CONTRADICTION.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:39.335
WE FOR CITED THE FACT THAT.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.870
IN FLORIDA THEY FACE THE SAME

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:43.639
EMERGENCY FOR HURRICANES AND WE

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.308
ALSO FACE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.243
RESPECT EARTHQUAKES.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.178
AND WE IF YOU'LL SEE IN OUR

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:52.415
REPORT IN OUR SECTION OF AND

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.050
THAT'S WHY MY COLLEAGUE PROBABLY

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.718
DIDN'T JUMP TO THE THE THOUGHT.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.887
ON IN OUR SECTION WE RECOMMEND

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.855
CONSOLIDATING THE APPROACH WE

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:02.391
THINK THAT HAVING FIFTY NINE

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.092
DIFFERENT.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:06.028
APPROACHES TO HARDENING AND

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.097
SAFETY AND HERE'S THE POINT

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:08.831
FIFTY NINE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.833
AGENCIES COORDINATE WITH CAL

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.835
FIRE AND YES.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.670
ISRAEL MAKES NO SENSE THAT WOULD

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:15.938
MAKE SENSE SINCE THIS IS SUCH A

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.174
BIG EMERGENCY TO HAVE ONE

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.012
CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY THAT

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.513
COLLECTS DATA THAT.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.748
MARSHALS RESOURCES AND

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:26.949
COORDINATES WITH THE STATE SO.

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.818
THAT KIND THAT'S OUR BEST EFFORT

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:29.318
AT YOUR MARTIAL PLEDGE.

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:30.052
THE SHERIN THANK YOU FOR THE

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.520
OPPORTUNITY AND I WANT EXPRESS

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.322
SAID.

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.024
REAL APPRECIATION FOR THE

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:36.325
QUALITY OF THE WORK I I'M JUST

GONNA SAY THAT YOU FOLKS ARE

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:38.794
REALLY GOOD.

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.396
THAT I APPRECIATE HOW DEEP AND

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:41.997
THOROUGH YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS AND

THANK YOU FOR HAVE.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.800
APPROACHING THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:45.901
THAT I'VE RAISED I'M VERY

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.070
GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.205
THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE.

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.607
EVAN AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.642
HAVE NOT MET AS A AS A BODY TO

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.144
SOAR RECONCILE YOUR POINTS OF

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.079
VIEW SO WE WE APPRECIATE SO THE

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.582
RAWNESS OF PRESENTATION IN TERMS

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:00.850
OF KNOWING THAT THERE ARE STILL

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.151
ELEMENTS THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:03.452
COME TOGETHER ON SO.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.621
WE APPRECIATE THE REFLECTIONS

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.825
BUT UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT IN

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:12.428
WHICH YOU HAVE TO REPORT DR.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:12.762
FIRST OF ALL.

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:13.396
AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID WE

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.363
REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.164
YOU'VE DONE.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.866
I ALSO APPRECIATED THE ANSWERS

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:19.602
THAT YOU GAVE TO OUR VICE CHAIR.

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.303
THAT YOU FULLY REALIZE HOW

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.838
IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP THE

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.774
UTILITIES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY IF

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.511
THE RATE PAYERS AND THE VICTIMS

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:29.945
OF THE FIRE GOING TO BE MADE

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.247
WHOLE.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:34.650
AND YOU REFLECT THAT ON A CAP ON

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.952
UTILITY PAYMENTS.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:38.254
NOT VOTE FOR THAT THE MINUTE.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.055
BUT I KNOW OF ONE SENATOR IN

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.858
PARTICULAR -- CALL IT A BAILOUT.

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:47.563
THE BAILOUT IS BANKRUPTCY -- AND

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.598
I'LL GET INTO THAT MORE BUT THAT

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:51.400
IS THE BALLOT FOR THE UTILITY IT

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.735
IS BANKRUPTCY THAT IS THE

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.370
BAILOUT FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS IN

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.604
HIS BANKRUPTCY.

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:56.705
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD PEOPLE

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:57.440
ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE TO AVOID

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.842
THAT.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.877
YOU TALK ABOUT A PRUDENT MANAGER

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.180
STANDARD.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.581
WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT WE'RE

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.949
SUPPOSED TO GET SOMETHING DONE

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:08.584
BY JULY TWELFTH.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:11.320
NOT SURE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BY

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.755
THE END OF THE SESSION.

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:13.522
THE ONLY THING WE'VE REALLY

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.658
WORKED ON SO FAR AND THAT'S FOR

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:18.727
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE IS THE THE

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:21.430
FIRE FUND.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.732
SO HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GO

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.668
ABOUT LOOKING INTO PRUDENT

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.102
MANAGER STANDARD WHERE SHOULD WE

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:30.539
START.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.274
MARY FOR A REPORT.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.442
WELL I'VE READ IT AND I DON'T

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:36.545
SEE LEGISLATION NOT SOMETHING I

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.013
CAN PUT INTO LAW AND I HAVE.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.816
NOT HAD TIME TO TO REACH I HAVE

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.451
GONE THROUGH IT RIGHT.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:43.953
BUT I DON'T I DON'T SEE

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.354
LEGISLATION THERE.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.523
UNDERSTOOD WELL ONE THING THAT I

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.458
HAVE BEEN HEARTENED BY ITS THAT

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.960
AS WE'VE ALL BEEN GOING ABOUT

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.228
DOING OUR WORK.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.262
INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS HAVE

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:55.030
BEEN DOING WORK ON THEIR OWN AND

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:57.199
SO I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.901
UTILITIES RATE PAYER ADVOCATES

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.603
INVESTORS HAVE ALL BEEN THINKING

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.171
ABOUT THIS QUESTION AROUND COST

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.439
RECOVERY AND PRUDENT.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.608
MANAGER STANDARD BECAUSE IT HAS

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:08.043
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY IF NOT

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:10.145
THE KEY ISSUE OF CONCERN.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.348
PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTORS AS I

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:14.216
THINK ABOUT.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:14.783
HOW WILL THEY BE JUDGE GOING

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.318
FORWARD ME THE BASIC QUESTION IS

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.887
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO BE

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.489
PRUDENT -- AND SO I THINK THAT

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:21.590
THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE LAID

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:22.925
OUT OUR FEASIBLE WITHIN

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.194
LEGISLATION ONE OF OUR

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.262
RECOMMENDATIONS OPTION.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.198
TWO REFERS TO ADDING AN EMPHASIS

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:29.765
TO THE NINE A ONE LANGUAGE

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:35.137
AROUND THE FACTORS THAT -- MIGHT

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:37.039
MITIGATE.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:37.806
IN PRUDENT BEHAVIOR THINGS THAT

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:39.174
ARE EXHAUSTION IS LIKE WEATHER

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:40.009
PATTERNS CLIMATE CHANGE ETCETERA.

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.043
IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO WITH

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.511
ADOPTING THE FIRST STANDARD THAT

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.014
IS ALSO A STANDARD THAT IS OUT

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.115
THERE AND I THINK THAT LANCASTER

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.783
BE THE FIRST SO THE FIRST HAS A

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.552
STANDARD IN TERMS OF THE SHIFTED

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.186
THE BURDEN OF PROOF FOR PRUDENT

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:51.587
SEE.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.122
IS TO THOSE ARE INTERVENING IN A

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:54.723
PROCEEDING SO THAT IS THE

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.592
STANDARD THAT YOU WOULD APPLY TO

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.627
THE EXISTING P. YOU SEE AT

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.930
PROCEEDING PROCESS AS WELL.

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.398
IN TERMS OF OUR THIRD OPTION.

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.800
ABOUT A ABSOLUTE CAP ON

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.702
SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY ASSUMING

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.537
THAT THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:11.540
CONTRIBUTION -- TO A FUND AGAIN

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:12.841
I THINK THERE ARE POTENTIAL

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.643
OPTIONS OUT THERE AND THAT

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.212
UTILITIES INVESTORS WILL COME

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:18.914
FORWARD WITH PROPOSALS TO YOU

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.149
OKAY WELL BUT THE PROBLEM WILL

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:21.383
BE GETTING IT DONE WHEN SO MANY

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.185
PEOPLE WANT TO POLITICIZE THE

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:23.852
ISSUE.

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.121
HI THIS IS A BAIL OUT IF YOU CAP

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.524
THE UTILITIES.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:29.925
WHEN THE REAL BALLOT THIS

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.595
BANKRUPTCY SO I MEAN WHAT MAY I

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:34.163
HAVE A MOMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.964
EVERY **** BEEN REFLECTING ON

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.364
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.365
NOW THAN LAST YEAR AND ONE THING

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:39.268
THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THE NINE OH

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:39.868
ONE SB NOT A ONE ORDERING THE

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.937
WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS FOR

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:42.838
THE UTILITIES.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.373
THE P. YOU SEE HAS WORKED VERY

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.908
QUICKLY AND HARD TO TO GET THOSE

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.610
PLANS APPROVED AND IT STARTS THE

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:54.783
COURSE OF HAVING.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.051
A PLAN THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.252
TO MEET BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.087
THE CONCERNS WE TALK ABOUT A

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.588
BAIL OUT IS WILL ONE CENT OF IS

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.155
THERE FOR THE UTILITY TO DO

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.123
RIGHT.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:01.790
WHY I BELIEVE THAT THE UTILITIES

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:02.358
WILL DO THEIR BEST TO AVOID

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:02.992
WILDFIRES BECAUSE THE SITUATION

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:03.626
IS NOT TENABLE FOR THEM AS WELL

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.761
NO ONE WANTS TO BE IN A POSITION

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.129
TO HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME OF

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:07.363
THESE?

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:08.964
LAST RESORT OPTIONS AND THEN

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.599
ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.134
IMPROVING PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.469
I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE TIME IS

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:14.503
RIGHT TO RELY ON THOSE

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.106
MEDICATION PLANS EXCLUSIVELY FOR

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.440
SAYING TO PRODUCE THE STANDARD

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:20.342
BUT I DO THINK THEY HELP PROVIDE

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.344
THE RIGHT INCENTIVES FOR THE

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:24.980
UTILITIES. TO BEHAVE BETTER SO

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.181
ONE OF MY CONCERNS THERE IS THE

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.550
P. YOU SEE HAS NOT SAID WHETHER

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.185
OR NOT THE UTILITIES.

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.321
WILL BE ABLE TO GET ARM RATE

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.891
PAYERS TO PAY FOR THAT WORK.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.628
WHICH PROBABLY DOWNGRADED --

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.697
YEAH THIS IN AND SAN DIEGO GAS

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.499
ELECTRIC -- IF IT DOESN'T DOUBT

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:44.900
GRAY THEM TODAY IT'LL DOWNGRADE

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.102
THEM TOMORROW NOT KNOWING THAT

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:50.172
THOSE CAN BE REIMBURSED -- I

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.274
REALLY WELL.

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.410
THEN TO GET ONTO CATHOLIC THINGS

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.344
I WILL SAY THIS I MEAN THE TOTAL

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.345
MAGNITUDE OF THOSE COSTS ARE A

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.279
FEW BILLION FROM WHAT I'VE

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.348
UNDERSTOOD FROM RATING AGENCIES

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.916
THEIR CONCERN IS NOT THAT

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.751
LIABILITY WHICH IS.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.421
UNDERSTOOD IT'S THE POTENTIAL ON

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:06.855
CAPITALIZE BILL OF THE OF

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:07.790
BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:08.857
OKAY WITH POTENTIAL FIRES SO

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:16.131
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE HAD TO DO.

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.099
TO KEEP THE OTHER TWO INVESTOR

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.300
OWNED UTILITIES OUT OF

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:19.802
BANKRUPTCY KEEP P. JEANNIE FROM

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:20.869
GOING INTO IT AGAIN WHEN IT

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:21.603
COMES OUT.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.739
AND TO KEEP THE PUBLICLY OWNED

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.542
UTILITIES FROM GOING INTO

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:31.447
BANKRUPTCY -- THAT'S WHAT I I'M

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.081
GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION A

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.248
SECOND BUT FIRST LET ME.

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.616
TALK ABOUT GETTING RID OF

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:35.684
INVERSE.

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:36.752
NOW FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.320
UTILITIES THAT'S ONLY BEEN A

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.389
DOCTRINE SINCE THE MID NINETIES

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.024
THAT WAS AN INTERPRETATION

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:42.925
THOUGH.

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.327
OF HEARD APPELLATE COURT LOOKING

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.830
AT CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.498
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:51.700
HAD A CHANCE TO ROUTE TO TAKE A

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.135
LOOK AT THAT INTERPRETATION P.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.938
JEANNIE BROUGHT IT FORWARD THEY

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:58.040
REFUSE TO LOOK AT IT.

01:12:58.107 --> 01:12:58.707
IT.

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.008
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY WON'T

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.343
LOOK AT IT EVENTUALLY AND MAYBE

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.779
DECIDE BUT FOR THE MOMENT THEY

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.380
DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT WAS A

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:08.317
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REALM OF

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.419
VALID INTERPRETATION. FOR THE

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.921
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES WATER

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:15.524
AND ELECTRIC IT'S VERY CLEAR TO

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.026
ME HE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.395
IT WAS SET UP TO DO THIS.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.498
THE IDEA WAS IF CITY OR A COUNTY

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:26.201
BUILDS A ROAD OR BRIDGE -- THEN

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:29.571
IF DOWNSTREAM THERE'S A FROM THE

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.507
BRIDGE THERE'S SOMEONE IS LOST

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.242
PART OF THEIR PROPERTY IT'S

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.844
ACCEPTED THAT A PUBLIC ENTITY

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.445
CAN.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:37.980
A CHARGE TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:40.115
THAT THE WHOLE IDEA WAS TO BE

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.750
FAIR IF SOMEONE IS HIDDEN IN IN

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:42.918
VIRTUALLY HURT.

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.521
BY SOMETHING GOING WRONG WITH

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:46.755
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.690
NOW WE DO HAVE A LAWYER HERE BUT

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.492
I DO NOT SEE ANY WAY WE CAN BY

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:52.294
LAW.

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:54.863
FIX THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.198
AND IF WE WERE TO TRY TO DO

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.699
SOMETHING FOR THE INVESTOR LEóN

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:58.867
UTILITIES.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.703
AGAIN I WOULD SAY.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.238
I DON'T SEE A WAY TO DO THAT

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.540
EITHER IT WOULD OF COURSE GO

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.542
INTO COURT BY THOSE WHO FELT

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.110
THEY WERE.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.346
DAMAGED BY THIS ARE MOST LIKELY --

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.916
ATTORNEYS AND INSURANCE

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.717
COMPANIES THEY WOULD FIGHT IT.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:18.620
ARM I JUST DON'T SEE AND PERHAPS

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.721
IN WHAT I WANT TO HEAR IS

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:22.391
PERHAPS FROM THE LAWYER HERE WHY

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:24.426
THEY THINK PASSING A LAW.

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:27.029
WOULD BE -- WOULD JAM.

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.765
OF TRUMP THE CONSTITUTION OF THE

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.533
STATE I JUST DON'T SEE.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.368
SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT YOU

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.170
HAVE VERY GOOD GRASP OF THIS --

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.605
AND I DON'T KNOW.

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:37.639
WHAT I CAN ADD THAT'S THAT

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:39.208
INTELLIGENT BUT I'LL GIVE YOU

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.944
THE CONTRARY VIEW?

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:46.949
FIRST OF ALL AS TO THE APPELLATE

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:47.583
AN E. M..

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.885
EARLIER LIABILITY AS ALL OF YOU

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.486
RECALL IN THE NINETIES THE

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.188
UTILITIES IN THE STATE WERE

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.090
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MONOPOLIES

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.458
AND THEY HAD AN ABSOLUTE

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.828
OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ON RATES TO

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:00.863
THE RATE PAYERS.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:03.131
ARM AND THE THE NUMBERS WERE

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:06.668
SMALL AND THE THE AN ANALYSIS OF

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:07.302
THEIRS THERE IS THERE A I THINK

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.403
THERE SEVEN APPELLATE COURTS IN

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.338
THE STATE'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.139
ONLY TWO APPELLATE COURTS HAVE.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.674
DEALT WITH THIS AND THE ONE

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:13.775
APPELLATE COURT THE DEALT WITH

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.143
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE I. O.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.645
U.'S DEALT WITH IT IN THE

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:17.746
CONTEXT OF THE TIME THAT THE

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.248
IRAQIS WERE MONOPOLY.

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.515
AND HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.217
PASS THE RATES ON THEY WOULD DID

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.386
NOT FACE A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:25.954
UTILITY WAS ORDERED TO DO

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.689
SOMETHING AND HAD NO OPPORTUNITY

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.359
TO PASS THINGS ON I DO BELIEVE.

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:32.227
THAT THE BUNCH CASE THE FLOOD

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.062
CONTROL CASES MAKE ABSOLUTELY

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.298
CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.733
CANNON NOW IT'S AND THE GOVERNOR

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.835
CAN ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE FACING

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.403
UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY AND WE

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.338
HAVE TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES IN A

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:44.473
WAY TO FIGHT OFF.

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:48.777
WHAT IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.145
POPULOUS?

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.079
IN THE BUNCH CASE AND IN THE

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.581
LEGISLATIVE THE THE CONSTITUTION.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.715
IS INTERPRETED WILL BY THE

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.084
LEGISLATURE THAT IS CLEAR AND

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:57.986
WHERE THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.955
INTERPRETED THE CONSTITUTION THE

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:02.291
LEGISLATURE IS -- DIFFERENCE SO

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.558
NUMBER ONE THE SUPREME COURT HAS

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.294
INTERPRETED IT NUMBER TWO THE

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.828
LEGISLATURE CANADA FOR THE

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.364
CONSTITUTION NOT TO APPLY I'M

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.133
TALKING ABOUT THE I'LL USE ONLY

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.134
NOMINAL PARTY I'LL USE BECAUSE

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.502
THEY ARE NOT VERTICALLY

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:14.436
INTEGRATED.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.038
MONOPOLIES ANY LONGER BUT

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.706
INSTEAD HAVE TO GO TO THE P. YOU

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.708
SEE AND HAVE TO BEG FOR THE

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.610
MONEY TO BE PASSED ON SO I

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:22.311
BELIEVE.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.413
THE UNDER THOSE TWO DOCTRINES

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.882
THE LEGISLATURE CAN ANNOUNCE

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.951
THAT A WOULD THAT THE DOCTOR THE

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.485
INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOES NOT

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:34.256
APPLY TO THE I USE THIRD.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.724
WE'VE THIS IS NOT THIS IS A REAL

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:36.858
SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AND JUST SO

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.193
YOU ALL UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.461
WAS ON THAT PROP THIRTY

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.829
COMMISSION I WAS THE HEAD OF THE

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:43.398
I. SO DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS.

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:44.299
I WILL WORK THROUGH THE ENTIRE

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.702
ENERGY SITUATION I'VE DEALT WITH

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.137
A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE STATE

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.038
THIS IS THE BIGGEST ONE I'VE

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:50.572
EVER SEEN.

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:51.506
AND THE AND IT'S A SELF

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.842
INFLICTED WOUND I BELIEVE THAT

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.277
THE LAW IN THE STATE IS THAT THE

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.511
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:58.113
ANNOUNCED WE HAVE A REAL

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.948
EMERGENCY AND IF YOU READ OUR

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:00.849
REPORT AND THE STRIKE FORCE

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:01.450
REPORT.

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.418
WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED THREAT

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.854
OF WILDFIRES THE COSTS ARE

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.923
UNPRECEDENTED I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.124
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.993
ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ON

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.294
PRESIDENTE THREAT.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.695
AND WE WERE MEETING THE THREAT

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:15.497
UNDER THE BUNCH CASE UNDER THE

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.232
LEGISLATIVE INTERPRETATION

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.867
DOCTRINE THAT THE SUPREME COURT

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.702
WOULD DIFFER I DO NOT BELIEVE

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.337
THE SUPREME COURT WOULD SAY.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.306
WE ARE IMPOTENT TO TO MEET

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.008
EMERGENCY OF THIS NATURE AND WE

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:31.046
HAVE AN EMERGENCY WE'RE TALKING

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:31.246
ABOUT.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:31.980
RIGHT NOW

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.248
MULTIPLE TWENTY THIRTY BILLIONS

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.383
BUT WE COULD BE FACING ARM

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.984
DEPENDING ON THE SUMMER WAY

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.753
GREATER SO AS TO THE I'LL USE I

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.854
ACTUALLY THINK.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.789
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STRONG CASE

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.057
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.759
GOVERNOR STARTUP ANNOUNCED THERE

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.560
IS AN EMERGENCY AND THEY WERE

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:46.628
FACING EMERGENCY.

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:49.231
YOUR DISCUSSION OF THE PO USES

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.366
REALLY NUANCED AND TO BE.

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:54.269
HONEST REALLY SOPHISTICATED AND

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.738
I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE WRONG

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.874
YOU MAY BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT AND

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.375
THEY MAY NEED TO REORGANIZE

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.110
THEMSELVES TO DEAL WITH THIS.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:05.013
ON I I AM NOT CONFIDENT THAT

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.114
THEY CAN'T BE.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.549
PUT WITHIN THE UMBRELLA OF THE

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.185
EMERGENCY UNDER THE FLOOD CASES.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:12.354
THE THE THE OBJECTION THAT YOU

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:13.755
RAISED.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.057
WAS OVERRULED BY THE COURTS IN

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:16.925
MARCH SAID IN THE FLOOD

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:18.794
SITUATION IN THE BUNCH CASE THEY

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.429
GET ALL FLOODS.

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.397
ARE SUBJECT TO ARE NOT SUBJECT

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:24.199
THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION SO I

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:28.670
BELIEVE UNDER THE FLOOD CASE SO.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.772
ARM AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR LAWYER

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.240
IN BUT I WAS INVITED NO NO WE WE

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.810
WANTED THAT AT I BELIEVE THAT.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.745
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:39.281
COULD TAKE OUR REPORT AND THAT'S

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:39.748
RIGHT.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.950
FOR AND FACE UP TO THE FACT WE

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.552
HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.887
DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND THEN

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.989
LEGISLATE IN THE FIELD I BELIEVE

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.758
THEY COULD CREATE YOUR MARTIAL

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.493
PLAN THAT YOU SUGGESTED IN THE

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.462
SENSE OF MARSHALLING THE

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.664
RESOURCES AND CREATING A AGENCY

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:56.498
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.866
AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY DID THAT

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.668
THEY COULD ALTER THE LANDSCAPE

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.837
OF LIABILITY NOTE WE DON'T

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.439
ADVOCATE THAT THE LIVE THE

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.006
ITALIANS ARE OFF THE HOOK.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.975
RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT A

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.711
100% MY MY CONCERN IS IS MORE

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.079
DEALING WITH THE CONSTITUTION

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.414
AND WHAT IT IS THAT THE

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.682
LEGISLATURE COULD DO

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:17.085
TRADITIONALLY WE DO NOT OVER

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:17.486
REAL COURT CASES.

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.520
PERIOD.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.622
I IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING WE DO.

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:21.256
RIGHT BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.959
HERE WERE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.994
HAVE SIX DISTRICTS ONLY TO HAVE.

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.996
OPINED ON THIS THE OTHER FOUR OF

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.098
NOT RULE THE SUPREME COURT HAS

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.868
NOT RULED AND YOU KNOW I KNOW

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.603
THAT YOU DON'T OVERRULED COURT

01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:35.937
CASES BUT JUST.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.005
IN MY CHECKERED PAST THAT

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:38.840
REPRESENT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.308
AND ONCE UPON A TIME DIGITAL

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.843
COUNCIL WENT FOR THE RIGHT TO

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.311
ORDER COURT REPORTERS IN THE

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:44.045
COURTROOM.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.014
AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.482
WHILE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.851
NOT TO ACT AND THE LEGISLATOR

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.186
WANTED TO ACT THEY COULD HAVE

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.888
LEGISLATURE TAKES NOTE.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.756
THE SUPREME COURT TAKES NOTE OF

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.858
THE DECISION OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.527
TO ACT OR NOT TO ACT.

01:19:58.593 --> 01:20:04.633
ON ANYWAY IT'S MIGHT BELIEVE.

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.701
OPTIMISTIC THAT IF YOU WISH TO

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.570
SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU CAN.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.871
OKAY -- THE OUR FINAL QUESTION

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:10.972
IS.

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.775
WHAT YOU E. F. COMMISSIONER --

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.844
PETERMAN YOU SAID YOU'VE TALKED

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:17.245
TO THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.881
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO.

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.183
EITHER BETWEEN NOW AND JULY

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:22.517
TWELFTH AT THE END OF THIS

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.387
SESSION OR NEXT YEAR BUT WHAT DO

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.322
YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.291
THE OTHER UTILITIES FROM GOING

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:31.426
INTO BANKRUPTCY AND GETTING THE

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.328
SAME PROBLEMS WE NOW HAVE.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:36.398
WITH VICTIMS -- BEING PUT IN AN

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:37.432
AREA WHERE THEY CAN'T GET

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:39.301
COMPENSATION WHAT DO WE NEED TO

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.703
DO.

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.538
WELL I WOULD DISTINGUISH RATING

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.907
DOWNGRADES FROM AND BEING BELOW

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:48.577
INVESTMENT GRADE FROM BANKRUPTCY --

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.445
WELL WAIT A SECOND.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.180
THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE VERY

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.515
CLOSELY RELATED I'M SORRY TO

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.083
INTERRUPT BUT WHAT HAPPENED A

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.320
PGA ANY IS ONCE THEY WENT INTO.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.522
THE DOWNGRADE OF JUNK BOND THEY

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:02.123
COULD NO LONGER GET CASH.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.159
THEY DIDN'T GO INTO BANKRUPTCY

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.461
BECAUSE UP THERE WAS SOME HUGE

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.862
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAD TO

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:08.730
PAY.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.165
THEY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.967
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET CASH A

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.969
PARTLY THAT WAS BECAUSE THE CPUC

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.537
DID ALLOW THEM TO TAKE OUT A

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.772
LINE OF CREDIT -- PARTLY BECAUSE

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.909
THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WERE

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:23.111
GOING TO MAKE ANY. EIGHTY EIGHT

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.112
RULINGS SO THE P. YOU SEE DID

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.413
HAVE A ROLE BUT ONCE YOUR JUNK

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.416
BOND STATUS YOU RUN OUT OF CASH.

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:30.752
AND ONCE YOU RUN OUT OF CASH

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.487
YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.588
BANKRUPTCY.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.224
SO A OWNGRADE I BELIEVE THAT

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.426
EDISON IS JUST ONE OR TWO CLICKS

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.129
UP FROM.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:44.799
BOB JUNK BOND STATUS AND ELLIS

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:46.368
AND THEN SOUTHERN SAN DIEGO IS

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:53.508
GAS ELECTRIC IS I THINK THEY CAN

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:58.446
WELL DOCTOR QUIRK AYE YEAH FIND.

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.047
TO THE QUESTION MAKE THAT THE

01:21:59.114 --> 01:21:59.648
OTHER DISTINCTION WAS GOING TO

01:21:59.714 --> 01:21:59.948
MAKE THAT.

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:00.982
HAVING A BIG CATASTROPHIC WILD

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.751
FIRE WHERE THE LIABILITIES

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.919
POTENTIALLY OUTSTRIP THE ASSETS

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:07.355
IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN GETTING

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:10.525
TO BANKRUPTCY -- BUT EVEN IF WE

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.793
HAVE NO FIRES THIS YEAR -- I

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.328
WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:15.096
WHICH IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:17.065
RATING DOWNGRADES EVEN IF WE

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.400
DON'T HAVE A FIRE.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:19.934
AND THAT THE RATING AGENCIES

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.070
HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND THEY

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.271
CONTINUE.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.706
TO ISSUE PUBLIC DIRECTIVES

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:27.208
REGARDING THE EXPECTATION THAT

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.510
THEY WILL DOWNGRADE.

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.912
UTILITIES IF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.247
AS THE RISKY ENVIRONMENT FOR

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.715
UTILITIES IN THE STATE DOES NOT

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.384
IMPROVE -- SO I WOULD REFER YOU

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.019
ALL TO THE REPORTS FROM S. AND

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.054
P. AND MOODY'S.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.488
WHERE THEY HIGHLIGHT WHAT ARE

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.223
SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.258
LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE?

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.826
THAT WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL THAT

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.194
THE UTILITIES ARE NO LONGER

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:47.829
BEARING AS MUCH RISK

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.664
SPECIFICALLY THEY IDENTIFY

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:52.801
CHANGES AND REFORMS THE COST

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:56.037
RECOVERY STANDARD.

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.272
CHANGES IN VERSE A CONDEMNATION

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:58.340
ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY SEE THAT

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.642
AS A LOW PROBABILITY -- AS WELL

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.344
AS THE BUFFER IN SUPPORT THAT A

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.913
FUND COULD PROVIDE BUT I I WILL

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.614
SAY THE MAIN ONE THAT THEY

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:07.782
IDENTIFY IS REALLY TO COST

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.084
RECOVERY.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:09.718
BUT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:13.722
HAVE THOSE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:15.824

THE FLOOR BUT I THINK WE ALSO

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.010

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:37.312
SAW.

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.115

WORKING ON THIS -- JANUARY OF

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:25.253
LAST YEAR REALIZEVERY QUICKLY

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.188

THE FUND AND THERE CAN BE ALL

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.771
SORTS OF DIFFERENT FUNDS THE

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.073
GOVERNOR PROPOSED ILLIQUIDITY

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:46.541
FIND IN A CATASTROPHIC FUND

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.510
THOSE COULD BE ONE FUND -- THEY

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.645
COULD BE SEPARATE FUNDS THERE

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.280
COULD BE MULTIPLE FUNDS -- BUT

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.915
BROKEN UP BY GEOGRAPHY I THINK

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.750
I'VE NOW SEEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.019
DIFFERENT -- TYPES OF PLANS FOR

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.888
A DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF OF FUNDS

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.289
BUT IT STILL GOES BACK TO THAT

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.158
QUESTION OF OF WHO PAYS AND AND

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.159
AND HOW MUCH.

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:07.462
AND THE THE ONE THING THAT YOU

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:10.765
HAVE IN YOUR REPORT AND IS THAT

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.166
TOO BUT TO BROADEN NEEDS THAT

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.368
WERE BROUGHT IN -- THAT THAT THE

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.503
COST IS IT'S NOT JUST RATE

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.772
PAYERS AND SHAREHOLDERS AND

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:21.376
TAXPAYERS BUT YOU ALSO ADD ON

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.311
THE THE PROPERTY INSURANCE

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.146
PREMIUM PAYERS OR SOME SORT OF

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:28.416
SURCHARGE -- THAT'S A THAT'S

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:29.183

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:33.721
ABOUT A NEXUS THE DIFFERENCE

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:35.490
BETWEEN A TAX AND IF HE WAS

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.058
WHETHER THERE WAS A NEXUS AND I

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.626
LIKE TO SEE THINGS WHERE THERE

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.994
IS A VERY CLOSE.

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:43.064
NEXUS BETWEEN THE COSTS AND WHAT

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.732
YOU'RE GETTING A FOR A FOR THE

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.435
FOR THOSE COSTS AND SO.

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:52.740
WHEN YOU THINK OF SOLVING THIS

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:54.309
PROBLEM I'M?

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.076
YOU KNOW WHO WHO SHOULD PAY

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.077

THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:02.183
YOU NOTED. ONE OF OUR KEY

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.752
OBJECTIVES WAS RISK PULLING AND

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.254
SOCIALIZING ACOSTA MORE BROADLY.

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.590
AND IN THE FRONT CHAPTER WE

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:10.358
DETAIL WHY WE THINK.

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.427
ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.595
SHAREHOLDERS UTILITY MANAGEMENT.

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:15.863
PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE A ROLE TO

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:18.533
PLAY -- IN TERMS OF HELPING TO

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.935
REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK -- SO OUR

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.670
INTENTION WITH INCLUDING

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.505
PROPERTY OWNERS IN A SURCHARGE A

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.908
SURCHARGE ON INSURANCE WAS

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:28.977
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THAT WAS ALSO

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:31.446
A BROAD BASE OF INDIVIDUALS.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:32.647
OVER WHICH TO SPREAD SOME OF

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.115
THESE COSTS AND THEY DO HAVE

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.783
SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND HELPING

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.319
TO REDUCE THE OVERALL SIZE OF

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:39.821
WILD FIRE DAMAGE.

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:42.056
BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUS NOT JUST ON

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.424
THE IGNITION WE KNOW THAT

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:45.493
THERE'S WHILE FIRING MISSION BUT

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.028
THE TOTAL ACTUAL COST TO THAT

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.696
IT'S REALLY A FUNCTION OF WHAT

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:51.232
PROPERTY IS IN HARM'S WAY.

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:53.468
AS WELL AS WE KNOW WHAT

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.702
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS HAVE DONE

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.804
A LOT TO FORTIFY THEIR HOME AND

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.272
WHAT LEVELS OF INSURANCE THEY

01:27:58.339 --> 01:28:00.241
HAVE SO THAT WAS THAT THE NEXUS

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:01.042
THAT.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.510
WE IDENTIFIED.

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:06.547
WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS WOULD BE.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:09.283
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FEE THAN

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.418
OTHER FEES THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:15.089
ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.391
BEFORE AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY THE

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.425
TYPE OF FEEDBACK WE LOOK FORWARD

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:19.694
TO GETTING -- FOR THOSE WITHIN

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:22.230
THE INSURANCE MARKET AS THOSE AS

01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:23.931
WELL AS I'M FROM HOMEOWNERS STOW

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:25.566
I JUST WOULD LIKE.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.135
TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.870
DISCUSSED THIS.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:33.741
AND WE WILL ON FRIDAY AND WE'VE

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:34.642
BEEN PREVENTED TO TALK TO EACH

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.944
OTHER I I COULD BE THIS CLOSE TO

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:37.945
CARLA BUT I CAN'T TALK TO HER

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:40.548
ABOUT THIS -- A BECAUSE THE BAG

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.483
LOOKING RULES SO I THINK WORLD

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:43.518
WE MAY HAVE SOME MORE

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.319
ILLUMINATION FOR YOU ON THAT ON

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:46.287
FRIDAY.

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.423
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE TALKED

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.458
ABOUT WHO SHOULDN'T PAY ON HAND

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:52.126
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS WE

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.562
THOUGHT EVERY SOLUTION THAT

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.397
TALKED ABOUT FUNDS OR ANYTHING

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:58.866
ELSE WAS A DISGUISED WAY OF

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:01.069
MAKING THE RATE PAYERS PAY.

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:04.072
AND THE ONE THING THAT DROVE THE

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:06.974
LIABILITY SECTION AND I

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.342
ASSEMBLYMAN FORMER SELL ME A

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:10.311
NOVICE VIEW WAS THAT THE RATE

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:13.915
PAYER SHOULD NOT BE UNFAIRLY

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.550
BURDEN THAT WE SHOULDN'T.

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:17.351
PRETEND ARM THAT OUT SOMEBODY

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.953
ELSE IS PAYING BUT ACTUALLY THE

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.421
RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA IT'S GONNA

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:22.423
CREASE ACROSS THE RATE PAYERS SO

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:24.225
THAT'S DO YOU AGREE THAT THERE

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:28.162
MIGHT BE SOME INDIVIDUALS.

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:29.197
THAT OUR SHAREHOLDERS

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:29.497
[inaudible]

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.467
TAXPAYERS RATEPAYERS.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.268
AND BUFF PROPERTY INSURANCE

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:36.037
PREMIUM PAYERS THAT THERE'S

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.071
GONNA BE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.372
OUT THERE THAT ARE GONNA BE

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.807
THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING ON ALL

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:42.043
ON ALL FOUR CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.511
COR IS AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.279
QUESTION I THINK YOU YOU WE WERE

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:46.547
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RATE PAYERS

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:46.781
I KNOW.

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.716
WAS POLITICIANS -- BECAUSE I AM

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:50.351
ONE BY THE WAY -- BUT WE'LL

01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:51.619
WE'LL SAY I'M NOT A POLITICIAN

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:52.920
I'M A STATEMENT I LIKE TO THINK

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:53.721
THAT I'M A STATESMAN BUT I'M

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:54.789
ALSO.

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:57.358
I'M ALSO A POLITICIAN -- AND AND

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:59.660
AND BY THAT WE REPRESENT FOLKS --

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.696
AND SO WE LIKE TO USE DIFFERENT

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:03.331
TERMS TO TRY TO SHIELD -- YOU

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:04.298
KNOW WHAT ONE WHERE THE OTHER

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:07.235
BUT ULTIMATELY SOMEBODY -- IS

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.904
GOING TO PAY FOR A FOR THIS

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:11.839
LIABILITY IF WE DON'T SOLVE IT.

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:13.407
OF THE FOLKS LIKE THE DOCTOR

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:14.475
QUIRK WAS SAYING ARE GOING TO

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.443
PAY PHONE THROUGH BANKRUPTCY OR

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.445
WE DON'T SOLVE THIS AND WE

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:19.647
DOWNGRADE -- THE THE THE THE THE

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:21.082
THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES BEGIN

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.717
TO DOWNGRADE THE DEBT THE COST

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.619
OF BORROWING IS GOING TO GO UP

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:25.419
IN.

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:26.954
IF I HEARD -- CARLA CORRECTLY

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:27.588
MISTER MISS PETERMAN A CORRECTLY

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.190
THAT COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:32.894
COST 7% -- AND SO IT'S IT'S ONE

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.496
OF THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS THAT

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:36.097
THE THAT THAT I THINK WE DON'T

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:37.331
KNOW YOU YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:39.400
BUT I JUST WANT I THINK

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:43.971
EVERYBODY SHOULD DOC THE

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:45.173
FOLLOWING UNDERSTANDING.

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.774
INVERSE CONDEMNATION CREATES

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.376
ADDITIONAL COST WHETHER THAT

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:49.377
STATE WHICH IS TO HAVE IT OR NOT

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:50.912
THAT'S UP TO YOU FOLKS NOT US

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:53.614
BUT IT CREATES ADDITIONAL COST.

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.850
CURRENTLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.285
THAT COST IS PAID FOR BY

01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:00.354
INSURANCE IT'S ALREADY PAID.

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.322
FOR AND THE PURPOSE THE

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:03.257
EFFECTIVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:05.660
IS TO TAKE THE INSURANCE THAT

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:06.861
YOU BOUGHT.

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.329
AND PAID FOR FOR THE INSURANCE

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:10.298
CARRIER AND LET THE INSURANCE

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.967
CARRIER GOAL TO RECOVER THAT

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.869
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST WE

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.237
ASKED EVERYWHERE WE COULD

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:17.939
WHETHER THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.874
THAT IF THEY DO RECOVER THIS

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.309
COST THAT THE RATE THAT THE

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.610
PROPERTY OWNER WILL PAY LESS

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:23.311
INSURANCE.

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.912
WE WERE TOLD THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:27.114
OF THAT SO WHAT THE EFFECTIVE

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.382
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IN THE WHO

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:31.853
PAYS IS WE'RE TAKING MONEY.

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.321
THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:34.555
ALREADY.

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:37.024
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THEIR RATES AND

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.493
WE'RE GIVING IT TO ARM THE

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.828
INSURANCE COMPANY IT'S A

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:42.263
REIMBURSEMENT WERE CREATING A

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:45.099
COST AND THE WERE PAIN AND WE'RE

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:45.633
TAKING IT.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.234
WOULD GIVE ANYTHING INSURANCE

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.835
COMPANIES THAT IS A POLICY

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.303
DECISION WE COULD MAKE BUT

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:52.840
THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHO'S

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:53.574
PAYING.

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:56.944
CARLOS POINT ABOUT INSURANCE IS.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.146
THE OBSERVATION THAT ALREADY A

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:00.815
LOT OF THESE COSTS ARE PAID FOR

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.751
BY INSURANCE THAT IS OUR CURRENT

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:09.123
TO MECHANISM FOR PAYING FOR THIS.

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.025
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:11.859
PIGGY BACK ON THAT I THINK THAT

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.194
WAS HER OBSERVATION AND HEARINGS

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:14.195
AND I THINK IT WAS VERY CLEVER --

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.796
BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHERE

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.031
THAT COMES FROM THE LEFT THE

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:17.598
IDEA WHO REYES DREAD THOUGH

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:18.266
BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT COMES

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:19.200
UP WITH THAT IS THE UNDER

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:20.902
INSURED AND UNINSURED SO THOSE

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:24.405
WHO ARE NOT PAYING -- PREMIUMS

01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:26.407
IN ESSENCE -- ARE ARE THOSE THAT

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.175
ARE PAYING PREMIUMS ARE PAYING

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.877
FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T BY PAYING

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.112
FOR PREMIUMS RIGHT IT IS ON THIS

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:33.080
WE CALL THAT MORAL HAS WHAT IT

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.215
IS MORAL HAZARD AGAIN MORAL HELD

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:34.815
A PROBLEM.

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.485
OF IF YOU TELL THE INSURANCE IF

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.420
YOU TELL PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.589
HAVE INSURANCE -- WE'VE CREATED

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:42.590
THIS THING CALLED INVERSE

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.991
CONDEMNATION AND IF YOU DON'T

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:46.127
BUY INSURANCE WILL TAKE CARE OF

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.094
YOU.

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:48.095
THERE'S A WORRY THAT PEOPLE

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.964
WON'T BUY INSURANCE MORE TO THE

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.999
POINT THERE'S THE WHOLE RIFIC

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:54.001
PROBLEM OF PROPERTY VALUES

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.836
INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:58.339
RAMPANT UNDER INSURANCE RIGHT SO.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:01.809
THEN REMEMBER THE WE'RE PAYING.

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:03.711
FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:04.845
WE'RE PAYING FOR THE UNDER

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:07.181
INSURANCE RIGHT IN THIS COST I I

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.083
AGREE WITH I AGREE WITH THAT YES.

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:11.152
I WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER POINT BY

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.687
WAY OF BACKGROUND -- WE HEARD IN

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.789
OUR IN THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD A

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.123
PROPOSAL FROM EVERY PAIR

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:18.492
ADVOCATES GROUP AROUND.

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.394
HAVING A WILDFIRE FIND THAT

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.964
WOULD BE COMPLETELY CAPITALIZE

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:26.133
BY SURCHARGES ON INSURANCE --

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.702
THE PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS THAT

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.437
WHEN WE LOOK AT FOR REALLY FOCUS

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.472
ON AFFORDABILITY AND PRICKLY FAR

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.040
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:34.275
THAT WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.444
COSTS ON ELECTRIC REPAIRS AS

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.079
MISTER KHAN IS HIGHLIGHTED.

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:40.214
THAT POOR PEOPLE DON'T USE A

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.649
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF LESS

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:44.118
POWER THAN RICH PEOPLE AND SO

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.119
INHERENTLY.

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.355
ELECTRICITY PRICES CAN HAVE A

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.056
REGRESSIVE AFFECT -- THAT'S NOT

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.458
THE SAME WITH PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.859
AND I KNOW THAT ALL PEOPLE HOME

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.961
PROPERTY OR RICH BY ANY MEANS --

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.930
BUT THAT IS MORE CORRELATED WITH

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:58.366
WEALTH AND SO THE PROPOSAL FROM

01:33:58.432 --> 01:33:59.467
THAT REPAIR ADVOCATES GROUP WAS

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:00.434
THAT IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:02.570
EQUITABLY SOCIALIZE AND PART OF

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.704
WHAT WE MEAN BY EQUITABLE.

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.272
IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:13.781
CAN'T BEAR THE BURDEN DON'T HAVE

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:15.483
TO THAN SOCIALIZE ACROSS THE

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:17.251
BROADER TAX BASE OR CROSS POP

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:18.719
PROPERTY OWNERS -- WOULD BE A

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:19.353
MORE FAIR OUTCOME -- SO THAT'S

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.421
ANOTHER PIECE OF INPUT THAT WE

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.055
RECEIVED -- THAT LET MY WORKING

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:21.589
GROUP TO RECOMMEND SOME

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:22.523
COMPONENT COMING FROM PROPERTY

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:23.124
OWNERS I WILL SAY WE ARE VERY

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.925
HIGH LEVEL ABOUT HOW THE SPLIT

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:27.495
NEEDS TO BE -- IS THE PRINCIPAL

01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:28.562
MORE THAT WE WANT TO LEAVE YOU

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:30.398
WITH MR JUST HAVE TOO MUCH TO

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:32.800
MORE QUESTIONS -- ONE IS -- DID

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:34.235
YOU LOOK AT ALL ABOUT IT IN

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.936
ESTABLISHING A FIND.

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.104
A DID YOU LOOK AT WHETHER THEY

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.272
CAN BE BROKEN UP G.

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.241
GEOGRAPHICALLY MAYBE IN NORTH

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:41.609
STATE FUND AND A SOUTH STATE

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.177
FUND OR IS THERE ANY THOUGHT OF

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:47.281
JUSTIN NEEDED BE -- ONE ONE FUND

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:47.782
ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIA.

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:49.150
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:51.685
FUNDS WORK WELL IS PULLING RISK

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:55.856
AND SO THE BROADER EACH YOU CAN

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.324
GEOGRAPHICALLY.

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:58.959
SOURCE SAID AS WELL AS COMBINING

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.194
DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK OUR

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.829
UTILITY TERRITORIES HAVE

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:02.863
INHERENTLY DIFFERENT RISK COULD

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:05.132
DO TO THE GEOGRAPHY SO MY

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:06.734
CONCERN PRACTICALLY WITH

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:08.102
BREAKING UP INTO MULTIPLE FUNDS

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:09.603
IS THAT A VERY QUICKLY JUST

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.971
BECOMES IN A SELF INSURANCE

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.273
MECHANISM.

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:14.208
WITHIN EACH UTILITY TERRITORY I

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:16.277
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:17.578
THAT INCLUDING PUBLICLY OWNED

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:18.546
UTILITIES AN INVESTOR OWNED

01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:20.748
UTILITIES NOW ALLOWING THAT TO

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:21.849
BE VOLUNTARY.

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.184
BUT OUR DISSIPATION WOULD BE

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.852
THAT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.620
BUT ALL PARTICIPATE GIVEN.

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:27.888
THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME COST

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.423
RECOVERY FORMS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:31.192
THAT PARTICIPATION AND THEN THE

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.227
LAST QUESTION IS -- IN REGARDS

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:35.429
TO THE TIMING OF A FUND THE

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:38.199
RECOMMENDATION WAS TEN YEARS --

01:35:38.265 --> 01:35:40.267
WHY TEN YEARS WHEN NOT FIFTEEN

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.369
YEARS WHY NOT TWENTY YEARS IF

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:44.505
THIS IS A NEW NORMAL -- AND

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:46.907
THESE NEW CLIMATE I'M IMPACTS --

01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:48.609
HAVE CREATED THIS NEW NORMAL --

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:51.178
IS IT BECAUSE OF INVESTMENT --

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:53.047
IS IT BECAUSE THE STATE HAS

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:55.816
INVESTED IN -- BUT LAST YEAR WE

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:56.450
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HOW

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:57.051
TO D. G. R. F. WE JUST WERE

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:58.252
TALKING ABOUT THAT LAST LAST

01:35:58.319 --> 01:35:58.886
WEEK IS THAT NUMBER NEED TO GO

01:35:58.953 --> 01:35:59.687
HIGHER.

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:01.155
I'M IS IT BECAUSE OF THAT IS IT

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:01.822
BECAUSE OF THE WORK THE

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.124
HARDENING THAT WE EXPECT OUR

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:07.661
UTILITIES TO DO WHY TEN YEARS

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:09.830
AND NOT A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:10.464
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:11.665
WE I'LL MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:12.800
ON FRIDAY REGARDING OUR

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.535
RECOMMENDATION THIS REGARD WHICH

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:15.469
IS.

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:17.338
WE DON'T RECOMMEND AN AUTOMATIC

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:19.640
SUNSET TO A FUND -- I THINK YOU

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:21.976
SHOULD KEEP A FINE AS LONG AS

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.377
NECESSARY BUT WE WOULD

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.146
ANTICIPATE THAT WITH THE WILD

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:26.747
FIRE MITIGATION PLANS GOING INTO

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.716
A FACT TO SOME OF THOSE

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:29.316
PREVENTION EFFORTS GOING TO A

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:30.251
FACT.

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:32.753
THAT WE SHOULD SEE LOWER RISK IN

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:33.921
TEN YEARS AND SO.

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.256
WHEN WE'VE ASKED THE UTILITIES

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.056
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:37.324
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:39.059
MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK WE NEED

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.661
TO ACTUALLY SEE THESE MITIGATION

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.263
PLAN RESULTS COME INTO EFFECT?

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:43.664
TEN YEARS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.199
RAISED SO WE RECOMMEND.

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.035
EVALUATING THE FIND THE NEED THE

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:50.004
CAPITALIZATION EVERY FIVE TO TEN

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.072
YEARS -- AND THEN OVER TIME YOU

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.541
MIGHT NEED A VERY SMALL FUND

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.109
WHICH MIGHT JUST MAKES SENSE TO

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:56.677
ROLL IT DOWN BUT I WOULD NOT

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.913
AUTOMATICALLY SENSE THAT IT I

01:36:58.979 --> 01:36:59.480
THINK THAT MAKES SOME SENSE

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.948
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:05.152

PREPARING THIS AND HAVING THOSE

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:26.073
HEARINGS LISTENING TO THOSE WHO

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.343
ARE MOST AFFECTED. TO THEM

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.578
PREPARED THIS REPORT.

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:37.017
IN LOOKING AT THE THE PURPOSE.

OF THE COMMISSION -- IT.

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.256
WHERE IT AND I QUOTE IT IT WAS

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:42.990
TO MAKE?

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:45.226
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES TO

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:47.828
LAW THAT WOULD INSURE EQUITABLE

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:50.464
DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS.

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:54.635
AMONG AFFECTED PARTIES END QUOTE.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.470
MY CONCERN IS THAT FROM THE VERY

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.339
BEGINNING WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

01:37:58.405 --> 01:37:59.707
LOOKING TO SEE.

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.308
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT A VERY

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.310
POPULAR TERM BUT WE'RE LOOKING

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.845
TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BAIL

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.480
OUT.

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:07.881
OF THE UTILITIES.

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.049
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.684
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE TALKING

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:11.952
ABOUT AFFECTED PARTIES WELL THE

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:13.487
AFFECTED PARTIES ARE GOING TO BE

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.856
THE RATE PAYERS AND TO THE THE

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.324
THE FIRE VICTIMS.

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:19.059
THERE THAT THEY ARE THE AFFECTED

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.728
PARTIES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.463
DISTRIBUTION COSTS AMONG

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:23.697
AFFECTED PARTIES.

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:24.698
RATHER THAN.

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.367
AMONG AFFECTED PARTISAN

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.735
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.370
AND THEN WE JUMP RIGHT INTO

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:30.671
GETTING RID OF INVERSE

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:31.939
CONDEMNATION.

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.742
SOMETHING THAT.

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:37.978
L. IS DR CORPUS TALKED ABOUT A

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:38.746
WEEK IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:40.014
SOMETHING THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.315
IS ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED.

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:42.750
AND THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.518
VERY LONG SO SHOW EVEN IF WE'RE

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.153
GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.389
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:50.090
IN A VERY SHORT WHILE THIS GOING

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:52.059
TO HELP US IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.861
TO DO.

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:55.829
INVERSE CONDEMNATION HAS A LOT

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.064
TO DO WITH EMINENT DOMAIN SO

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.232
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE PROPERTY

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.900
THEN REVERTS BACK TO THE

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.435
HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THAT WAS A

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:03.370
TRADE OFF THERE WAS A BALANCING.

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:04.571
SO WE CAN'T JUST GET RID OF

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.807
EMINENT DOMAIN THERE'S A WHOLE

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:08.575
LOT MORE TO THAT.

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:13.013
I IT WASN'T JUST -- SAYING WELL

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:13.881
LET'S.

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:15.449
REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:18.919
UTILITIES HERE AND LET'S HAVE

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:20.254
LET'S PUT IN STRICT LIABILITY.

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:23.290
NO WE WAS THEY GOT TO TAKE YOU

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:24.692
THE PROPERTY WILL PAUSE I GUARD

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:26.160
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:28.062
TAKING THE PROPERTY THROUGH

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.664
EMINENT DOMAIN -- THERE WAS JUST

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.299
SO MUCH TO IT [inaudible]

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:36.070
THE IT LATER ALSO IN THE REPORT

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.604
WE TALK ABOUT SHIFTINGTHE

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:39.673
BURDEN I MEAN I WAS SHOCKED WHEN

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.375
I SAW THIS ONE QUITE FRANKLY

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.176
WERE.

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:44.678
NOW THE IT IS PRESUMED OR ONE OF

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:45.979
THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COST

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.247
RECOVERY.

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.216
THEY WOULD BE PRESUMED.

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:51.952
THAT THE UTILITY ADDED AT ACTED

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:55.789
PRUDENTLY AND IF BUT THOSE WHO

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.491
WERE AFFECTED CAN THEN FILED

01:39:57.558 --> 01:40:00.127
THEIR LAWSUIT AND TRY TO PROVE

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:02.029
OTHERWISE.

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:03.797
THAT ISN'T THE LINE I I WOULD

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:04.732
ABSOLUTELY.

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:07.868
OBJECT TO CHANGING THE THE

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:09.636
BURDEN.

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:12.506
SHIFTING THE BURDEN THAT WAY TO

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:13.507
THE VERY VICTIMS WERE TRYING TO

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:15.309
HELP SO WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:17.911
OUT WAYS TO HELP UTILITY AND

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:21.215
LIKE I GET IT WE DON'T WANT PGA.

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:21.749
TWO TWO TO BE COMPLETELY

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:23.884
BANKRUPT I KNOW WE WE DON'T WANT

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:24.852
THAT.

01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:26.987
WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO VICTIMIZE

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:28.455
A VERY VICTIMS WERE SAYING WHAT

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.023
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:32.393
HOW WE SOCIALIZE ALL OF THIS AND

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:34.328
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:35.729
FALL ON JUST?

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.798
ONE PERSON ONE GROUP.

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.466
WE'RE FORGETTING THE UTILITIES

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:40.968
WERE FORGETTING THE THE

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:44.505
SHAREHOLDERS AND I AND I EVEN

COST RECOVERY IT'S LIKE THE

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:52.679
STRESS TEST THAT WE HAD TALKED

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:54.548
ABOUT IN OUR NINE A ONE

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.049
DISCUSSIONS.

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.584
I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.253
BUT BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:02.756
A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:05.192
READ IT HERE HOW HAS MORE TO DO

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:07.394
WITH.

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:09.463
WITH FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:10.798
GOING TO HELP.

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:12.065
SPECIFICALLY PGA ANY THROUGH ALL

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:17.137
OF THIS.

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:21.008
WITHOUT CALLING IT A BAILOUT

01:41:21.074 --> 01:41:21.308
[inaudible]

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:25.446
BUT FINDING WAYS TO GET

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:26.780
EVERYBODY.

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:29.650
TO CHEN SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:31.485
OF BUSINESS.

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:33.554
THAT THAT ISN'T WHAT WE THAT

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.122
ISN'T WHAT I WANT TO DO.

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:38.058
I THINK THAT IF IF WE DIDN'T AND

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.460
I RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:42.062
THE SUNSET NECESSARILY.

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.330
BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.199
GOING TO BE THE WE'RE GOING TO

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:46.333
REEVALUATE.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.969
BUT I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED BY

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:49.436
THAT.

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:51.672
I I DO WANT US TO FIND SOLUTIONS

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.474
I DO WANT US.

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.708
TO YOU KNOW REVIEWS SO THEY'RE

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:58.545
TOO BIG TO TO TO FAIL I GET THAT --

01:41:58.612 --> 01:41:59.346
AND IN THE END THE RATE PAYERS

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:02.182
MAY PAY MORE IF THEY FAIL I GET

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:02.883
THAT.

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.886
BUT IF WE ARE BEGINNING OR AT

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.521
LEAST AS AS I READ THIS.

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.323
WE ARE BEGINNING THIS WHOLE

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:11.325
PROCESS.

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:14.528
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:18.765
FIGURING OUT A WAY. TO TO CHANGE

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:21.869
THE LAW. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.103
DISTRIBUTION OF COSTS AMONG

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:25.739
AFFECTED PARTIES.

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:27.341
I AM TERRIBLY CONCERNED

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:27.641
[inaudible]

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:33.480
ABOUT THAT -- I I APPRECIATE ALL.

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:34.848
STILL APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:35.282
THAT WENT INTO IT.

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:37.117
I DO I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:38.485
WORK THAT WENT INTO IT.

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:41.321
BUT BUT I AM I AM CONCERNED

01:42:41.388 --> 01:42:42.856
ABOUT BEGINNING THERE I'M

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:47.794
CONCERNED ABOUT FINDING WAYS. TO

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.196
TO HELP THIS.

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.998
CORPORATION NOT FILL THIS THIS

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:54.034
UTILITY NOT TO FAIL.

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.869
I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT.

01:42:55.936 --> 01:43:00.340
IS WHAT I HEAR MOST HERE -- I

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:02.342
APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS BY

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:03.744
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.779
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES IN TRYING

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:08.048
TO FIGURE OUT THIS FUND AND YOU

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:11.385
HAVE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT WAYS.

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:13.921
ARE ON ON ON PAYING OUT TO THESE

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:17.491
CLAIMS -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:19.393
THAT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:22.095
MAKING SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.931
AN INCENTIVE.

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:26.700
ON THE PART OF HOMEOWNERS TO

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:28.068
OVERSTATE THEIR CLAIMS.

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.269
BUT I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT YOU

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:31.138
TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE ISN'T AN

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:32.139
INCENTIVE ON THE USE.

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.507
OF THE PART OF THE UTILITIES

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:36.677
ALSO TO RELY ON THAT RATHER THAN

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:37.911
DOING THEIR WORK.

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:39.546
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:40.113
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THAT

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.316
WASN'T DONE AND I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:43.984
WE NEED.

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:44.585
TO TURN OVER THE LEAF AND YOU

01:43:44.651 --> 01:43:45.919
KNOW WE WE WE WE NEED TO TURN

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:48.922
THE PAGE AND GO ON TO THE NEXT

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:51.992
THING BUT I'M STILL THERE I'M

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:52.659
STILL IN THE FACT THAT.

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:54.861
THAT WE HAD SO MUCH THAT WAS.

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:57.798
NOT DONE BY OUR UTILITIES TO THE

01:43:57.864 --> 01:44:00.233
DEGREE THAT WE NOW HAVE THE

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.903
DEATHS AND WE HAVE THE THE LOSS

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:04.838
OF PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE.

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:10.477
I I I WANT TO BE SURE -- THAT

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:13.080
THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS.

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:15.649
THAT WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR WAYS

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:18.185
JUST TO HELP A UTILITY THAT

01:44:18.251 --> 01:44:20.187
WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HELP

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:21.555
THOSE VICTIMS.

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.223
AND THE RATE PAYERS.

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.359
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TWO THAT WE

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:26.593
SHOULD HAVE THE GREATEST

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.197
RESPONSIBILITY. TO AND SO I

01:44:30.263 --> 01:44:32.666
ASKED MY ONE QUESTION.

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:34.301
THE WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE FOR

01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:40.173
THE UTILITIES. TO BEHAVE BETTER.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.942
WELL LET ME SAY FOR SO I

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:44.011
APPRECIATE GREATLY YOUR COMMENTS

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:47.614
AS WELL AS YOUR FRUSTRATION -- I

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:50.317
SURE THAT FRUSTRATION.

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:51.385
WHEN I GOT?

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:52.586
APPOINTED TO THE WELFARE

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:53.954
COMMISSION MY LOOK AT THE

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.155
EXPERTISE THAT ALL FIVE MEMBERS

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.256
ARE BRINGING.

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:57.724
I WAS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC

01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:00.193
UTILITIES COMMISSION AND WITH

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.229
THAT I KNEW I HAD AND I STILL

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.164
BELIEVE A REAL RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:06.033
LOOK AT THIS FROM A REPAIR

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:07.434
IMPACT PERSPECTIVE.

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:08.769
AND WITH EACH OF THESE ISSUES AS

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:10.070
I LOOKED AT IT AND I THOUGHT

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:11.338
THROUGH.

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:14.007
SOLUTIONS MANY OF THEM COME BACK

01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:15.509
EVENTUALLY TO THE RATE PAYERS

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:17.044
IT'S JUST WHETHER WHERE HONEST

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:20.013
ABOUT THAT AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.416
AND SO.

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.751
I THINK WE ARE AT THIS TIME WHEN

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:28.722
THIS THE LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE.

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.857
AS THE SONG I MEAN THIS WAS NOT

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:31.892
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE GET TO

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:33.727
ANTICIPATED TO GET TO THIS

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:36.930
MAGNITUDE -- AND YOU KNOW

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:37.464
COLLECTIVELY.

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:39.166
WE HAVE NOT REQUIRE THAT LEVEL

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.567
INVESTMENT AND NOW WE'RE

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:42.636
REQUIRING THAT THE LEGISLATION

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:43.704
TO HAVE THE WHILE FIRE

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.505
MITIGATION PLANS OF THE EFFORTS

01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:47.407
AROUND CAL FIRE AND CLEARING OUR

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:50.077
FOREST ALL THAT IS GOOD WORK BUT

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:51.178
WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:51.712
DO.

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.180
AND I'M TO BE HONEST THAT' ALL

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:54.948
GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY.

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:56.883
AND IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:57.784
THAT MONEY.

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:59.853
I PARTICULARLY FROM INVESTORSAT

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.622
A REASONABLE PRICE IF WE DON'T

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:03.623
ADDRESS.

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.892
THE NEAR TERM A VIEW THAT THE

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:07.327
UTILITIES ARE TOO RISKY TO

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:08.128
INVEST IN.

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.530
SO THE WAY I PERCEIVE SEVERAL OF

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.699
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S ABOUT

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:15.802
RESTORING RIGHT NOW INVESTOR

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:16.937
CONFIDENCE.

01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:19.072
AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN UTILITIES

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:21.041
LONG ENOUGH TO LET THESE

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.043
PREVENTIONS WORK -- WE HAD

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.846
TESTIMONY THAT THE UTILITIES ARE

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:27.514
SCHEDULED TO SPEND. THREE I'LL

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:29.449
USE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:31.618
INVESTING IN OUR SYSTEM OVER THE

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:32.986
NEXT FIVE YEARS.

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:35.355
WE HAVE TO RAISE THAT MONEY FROM

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:37.057
BOND HOLDERS INVESTORS THAT'S

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:39.025
JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT RATE

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.494
PAYERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE I IN

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.661
REAL TIME.

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:43.029
AND SO GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW HOW

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.498
DO WE GIVE OURSELVES SOME

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:46.366
BREATHING ROOM COLLECTIVELY TO

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:47.901
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WHILE HOLDING

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:52.239
UTILITIES FEET TO THE FIRE SO TO

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:54.007
YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION.

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.041
WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE?

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:56.076
FOR THE UTILITIES.

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:57.677
TO BEHAVE BETTER -- I THINK

01:46:57.744 --> 01:47:01.181
THERE ARE A FEW. ONE IS MAKING

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:03.617
SURE THAT WE'RE PURSUING.

01:47:03.683 --> 01:47:04.818
FINES AND PENALTIES -- ALL OF

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:07.921
THAT WORK HAPPENS IN PARALLEL TO

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:11.057
A PRUDENT SEE DETERMINATION --

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.993
IT YOU THAT SO I THINK THAT'S

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:13.894
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.595
MAKING SURE WE HAVE THAT THE

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:16.797
SECOND IS HAVING ACTUAL WHILE

01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:18.031
FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HAVING

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.766
UTILITY SAY UP FRONT THIS IS

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.501
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.703
AN IMPROVING THOSE PLANS EVERY

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:27.073
YEAR -- THE OTHER IS REQUIRING

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.408
US SOME INVESTMENT BY

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.577
SHAREHOLDERS AND THE NUMBERS

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:31.778
THAT ARE BEING THROWN AROUND ARE

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:35.415
NOT INSIGNIFICANT -- AND I WOULD

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:37.250
SAY FAIRLY UNIQUE IN TERMS OF

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:38.451
WHAT SHAREHOLDERS HAVE BEEN

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:39.586
ASKED TO DO AROUND THE COUNTRY I

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:40.654
THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.856
SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY.

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:44.558
THAT THEY EXPECT.

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:46.493
THE STATE NOT TO BEAR ALL THESE

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.062
COST -- AND AND I THINK THAT YOU

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:51.264
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT -- IS

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:55.235
SO I I THINK WE'RE AT THE POINT

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:56.670
WHERE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.338
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT CAPITAL

01:47:58.405 --> 01:48:00.207
CAN MOVE ELSEWHERE AND WE REALLY

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:02.042
DO NEED THAT CAPITAL TO HELP US

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:03.577
INVEST IN ALL THE OTHER THINGS

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.412
THAT WE WANT TO SEE THE CLEAN

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:06.746
ENERGY ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:08.548
ETCETERA -- BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:09.482
COMMENTS TO HEART AND WILL

01:48:09.549 --> 01:48:10.984
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:13.653
CAN RECOMMEND -- TO MAKE SURE

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.221
THAT THE UTILITIES ARE HELD

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:16.356
ACCOUNTABLE -- BUT ULTIMATELY P.

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:18.625
GENIE IS THE BIGGEST UTILITY IN

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:21.127
THE STATE AND SO.

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:23.196
WE NEED.

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:25.966
THEM TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY.

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:27.200
AND STILL LOOK.

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:28.702
AT IT AGAIN DID YOU MENTION P.

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:31.705
GINNY EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND.

01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:32.672
IF WE'RE ASKING ALL OF OUR

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:34.841
UTILITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:35.242
FUND.

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.610
THERE WASN'T THE GREATEST SHARE

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:37.544
THEIR BANKRUPTCY SO WE CAN'T

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:38.712
REALLY EXPECT A WHOLE LOT FROM

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.080
THEM IN THE END THEIR

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:41.882
CONTRIBUTION AND THAT'S NOTED IN

01:48:41.948 --> 01:48:43.650
THE REPORT SO I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:48:43.717 --> 01:48:45.185
I'M NOT SAYING SOMETHING YOU

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:47.287
HAVEN'T ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT.

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.922
THAT'S A THAT'S A CONCERN.

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:51.124
AND THEN FINALLY WE TALK ABOUT

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:53.693
INVESTORS AND INVESTORS.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.362
CLEARLY CALIFORNIA'S NOW GOING

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:58.131
TO BE AN INVESTOR WHAT IS OUR

01:48:58.198 --> 01:48:59.633
RATE OF RETURN.

01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.301
I'M JUST A ONE POINT ABOUT THE

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:03.003
P. GINNY CONTRIBUTION.

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:04.337
I THINK THERE ARE PROPOSALS OUT

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:05.438
THERE.

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:07.841
FROM INVESTORS AND BOND HOLDERS --

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:09.743
REGARDING HOW THEY MIGHT

01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:11.344
CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTIONS OF

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:12.646
THOSE ARE MY PROPOSALS TO BRING

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:14.014
FORWARD AND THEY WERE NOT

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.515
SUBMITTED TO OUR RECORD -- AND

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:16.182
BUT I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE

01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:17.817
QUESTION ASKING I DO THINK THAT

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:19.052
THERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES I

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.420
EVEN WITHIN THE BANKRUPTCY

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:23.590
PROCESS. TO HAVE P. JEANNIE BEAR

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:24.758
THEIR SHARE OF THE RISK AND COST

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.527
SO I'D JUST LIKE TO RESPOND TO

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:28.662
YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:29.562
YOU.

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:31.965
ARE YOUR COMMENT AND MARRIED

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:35.702
WITH -- SOMEONE MAYES YOU FOR

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:37.304
YOUR YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS. ONE

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:38.104
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL A LOT

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.172
OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH IT.

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:42.676
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FACE

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:44.110
UP TO THE QUESTION OF WHO PAYS

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.612
AND IF THE POINT OF VIEW IS WE

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:47.213
REALLY WANT TO PRIORITIZE THE

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.548
VICTIMS.

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:52.085
AND TO GIVE THEM RIGHTS THAT ARM

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:53.453
AB THIS INVERSE RIGHT AND AT

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.056
THIS COST WHO SHOULD PAY FOR IT.

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:58.191
AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU MY POINT

01:49:58.258 --> 01:49:58.925
OF VIEW.

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.894
I THINK IF WE JUST IF THE STATE

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:03.563
DECIDES TO DO THIS AND IT'S YOUR

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.999
JOB NOT OURS.

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:07.600
I THINK THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD PAY.

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:10.303
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE RATE

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:12.472
PAYERS CAN PAY THE RATE THE THE

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:13.807
COST OF THIS.

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.742
NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT.

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.677
THE THE WE CAN GET ONLY SO MUCH

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:18.878
BLOOD FROM THE STONE WE CAN

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.413
BANKRUPT UTILITIES.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.116
THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THE RATE

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:25.185
PAYERS PAY AND YOU KNOW I'VE

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:26.619
BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE I BEEN

01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:27.654
THROUGH THE POINT WHERE THE RATE

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.255
PAYERS WHERE I WENT TO SAN DIEGO

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.290
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:31.458
THE RATE PAYERS WERE WRITING.

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:33.193
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO UPSET ABOUT

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:34.327
THE RATES.

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:35.929
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.664
INFLECTION POINT IN THE STATE WE

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:39.399
HAVE TO DECIDE IF IT IS YOUR

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:40.767
DECISION.

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:44.304
THAT YOU WISH TO KEEP THIS COST.

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:46.573
YOU CAN ARGUE YOU CAN DECIDE

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:47.374
WILL GOING TO KEEP IT TO THE

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.441
BANK FOR THE UTILITIES BANKRUPT

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.009
BUT YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.610
MONEY TO THE UTILITIES WILL BE

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:51.778
BANKRUPT.

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:53.013
AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.948
PAYS AND IT IS BY RESPECTFUL

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:57.851
OBSERVATION THAT THE RATE PAYERS.

01:50:57.917 --> 01:50:59.652
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANYMORE THEY

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:00.954
ARE READY AND HAVE TO PAY TO GET

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.489
THE SYSTEM BETTER THEY'RE READY

01:51:02.555 --> 01:51:03.390
COULD HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR ENERGY

01:51:03.456 --> 01:51:05.859
GOALS WE WERE READY ASK HIM TO

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.060
PAY FOR A CLIMATE GOALS.

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:09.329
THEY CAN'T PAY ANYMORE SO IF YOU

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:12.932
IN YOUR WISDOM DECIDE TO KEEP

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.934
THE INVERSE.

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.102
THEN FINE THEN MAKE THAT THE

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:17.837
DECISION OF THE STATE AND HAVE

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:20.240
THE TAXPAYERS PAY I DO THINK I

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:21.608
AM VERY SKEPTICAL.

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:23.810
OF ANY OTHER WAY I DON'T SEE HOW

01:51:23.877 --> 01:51:27.013
THE WE ALREADY HAVE INVERSE.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:30.717
WE WE HAVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN

01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:33.186
UNPAID FOR INVERSE IF WE WE WE

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:35.822
HAVEN'T FACED UP TO THE ISSUE.

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.724
OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IF WE

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:39.526
HAVE A TERRIBLE FIRE EXACTLY

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:40.427
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WERE

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:41.895
FACING UP TO WRITE BUT I WAS

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:43.696
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:44.264
I THINK I THINK THE BROADER

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:46.032
POINT THAT.

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:48.334
I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I CAN REALLY

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:49.969
SPEAK OF A LOT ABOUT AYE NUMBERS.

01:51:50.036 --> 01:51:51.271
THAT THE POINT INVERSE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:52.472
CONDEMNATION ASSUMES THAT YOU

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:55.575
CAN PROBABLY SOCIALIZE THE COST --%

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.210
THAT AT TIMES IS INTENTION AND

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:58.945
EVEN CONFLICT WITH THE

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:00.613
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE THE PUBLIC

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.815
UTILITIES COMMISSION.

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.483
I TO SURE THAT RATES ARE JUST

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:04.784
AND REASONABLE AND A BROADER

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:05.685
MISSION TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.921
AFFORDABLE AND SO WE'RE AT THE

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:09.289
INTERSECTION OF THAT CHALLENGE

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:11.424
OUR REPORT NOTES A. P. YOU SEE

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:14.394
REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT SB.

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:15.428
SIX NINETY FIVE REPORT WHICH

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.897
TALKS ABOUT HOW RATES ARE GOING

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.332
UP IN THE STATE FOR A HOST OF

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:21.201
REASONS AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:22.735
THIS QUESTION AND REALLY ABOUT

01:52:22.802 --> 01:52:24.370
COULD THE RATE PAYERS ABSORB

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:25.271
THIS.

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:26.506
THE INPUT WE GOT WAS NO AND SO

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:29.075
THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES THEN

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:31.177
WHAT.

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:31.778
AND AND JUST SO TOOK MAKE THE

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:34.180
POINT WE DID HAVE TESTIMONY.

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:35.982
THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:37.817
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:38.885
AFFORD THEIR LECTURES CITY NOW

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:40.420
UNDER NOT GETTING IT.

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:42.288
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:44.257
IF WE MAKE THE RATES SO MUCH

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:46.459
MORE HIGH WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:48.394
PEOPLE WILL WITHDRAW YOUR THE

01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:49.529
ENERGY COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THAT.

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:50.930
BETTER THAN I DO THE PEOPLE

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:52.265
WITHDRAW FROM THE ELECTRIC

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:54.934
SYSTEM AND THE RATES WILL GO UP

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:56.236
ON A SMALLER BASE SO.

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:59.405
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE.

01:52:59.472 --> 01:53:01.441
WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE TO PAY BUT

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:03.176
IT IS FOR ME TO POINT OUT IN A

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.611
ROLE AS A COMMISSIONER THAT

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:06.312
SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:08.114
AND IN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:11.351
NOT EQUITABLE? TO MAKE THE THIS

01:53:11.417 --> 01:53:13.219
POLICY DECISION.

01:53:13.286 --> 01:53:14.154
ON THE BACKS OF THE RATE PAYERS

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.389
IT'S PERFECTLY FAIR FOR THE

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:18.725
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE TO

01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:20.760
SOCIALIZE ACOSTA AMONG ALL OF

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:22.495
THE CITIZENS BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:22.996
POLICY.

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:25.365
SO IN ANSWER YOUR SECOND

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.467
QUESTION ABOUT INCENTIVES ASIAN.

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.436
I I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW I

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:32.105
THINK THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL NUMBER

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:32.672
THREE I THINK WE NEED A NEW

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:33.773
SHERIFF.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.042
I THINK THAT AND I THINK THAT

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:37.844
IT'S EXPRESSED IN OUR OUR IN IN

01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:39.546
MY PART OF THE REPORT.

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:40.847
THE FEELING IS THAT THE CURRENT

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:42.448
SHERIFF ISN'T DOING A VERY GOOD

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:45.185
JOB AND IT'S NOT ITS ENTIRELY

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:47.387
IT'S FALL THE P. YOU SOMETHING

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:48.922
ABOUT SEPARATE GROUP YES.

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:49.455
THE P. YOU SEE WAS SET UP

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:50.490
CONSTITUTIONALLY TO REGULATE THE

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:51.925
RAILROADS.

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:53.693
WE HAVE A ONE HUNDRED YEARS WITH

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.962
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND AN

01:53:56.029 --> 01:53:57.597
IN PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES.

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:00.033
YOUR NEVER IN MY PERSONAL

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:01.801
JUDGMENT IT'S JUST ME.

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:03.036
BUT IT'S IN OUR REPORT YOU'RE

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:05.104
NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MODIFY

01:54:05.171 --> 01:54:07.373
IT. TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE TO AN

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.143
EMERGENCY WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:11.311
AND SO.

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:12.979
I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY WE

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.981
NEED TO DO MORE WE CAN DO MORE

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:18.051
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO HYPOTHESIZE

01:54:18.117 --> 01:54:19.419
THAT THIS.

01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:21.421
RAIL ROAD RATE MAKING

01:54:21.487 --> 01:54:23.489
INSTITUTION WHICH HAS GOT ALL

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:25.124
THESE RULES OR REGULATIONS.

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.460
THE THE POOR COMMISSIONERS --

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.429
ARE TREMENDOUSLY HAMSTRUNG BY

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:32.699
THE WAY IT WORKS SO IN MY

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:33.733
JUDGMENT THE ANSWER TO YOUR

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.235
INSTEAD OF STATION QUESTION IS

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.970
TO GET A NEW SHERIFF.

01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:39.005
MAKE IT ACTUALLY IN ITS LAID OUT

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:40.240
EXPLICITLY IN OUR REPORT MAKE IT

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:41.574
CLEAR THAT THAT NEW SHERIFF WILL

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.109
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CRIMINALLY

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:44.677
REFER.

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:47.213
TO PROSECUTE THIS ASSEMBLY AND

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.582
TO INCENTIVIZE WHERE IT SEEMS

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:52.518
JUDGE ALL STOP ONCE WAS OUT OF

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:53.653
ICE IF MY LIFE AND JUST.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:55:00.960
MAY I I JUST BECAUSE THIS IS

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:04.264
COME UP A FEW TIMES -- IT'S

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.431
REGARDING WHO SHOULD HAVE

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:06.733
OVERSIGHT OVER THESE WILL OF

01:55:06.799 --> 01:55:08.434
WILDFIRE MATTERS I I DO HAVE A

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:09.068
DIFFERENT VIEW THAN COMMISSIONER

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.570
CON ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:11.571
THAT AND HE'S ACKNOWLEDGE VERY

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:12.438
WELL IN HIS SECTION THAT.

01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:13.673
WE HAVE DIFFERENT AND

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:15.141
INCONSISTENT RULES ACROSS. FIFTY

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:15.775
SEVEN UTILITIES THAT IS NOT NEW

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:17.176
THAT IS OUR CIRCUMSTANCE FOR

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.811
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS AND

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.513
ENERGY REGULATION AND THE

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.882
LEGISLATURE THROUGH MECHANISMS

01:55:22.949 --> 01:55:24.450
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE RENEWABLE

01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:25.251
PORTFOLIO STANDARD IS REALLY

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:26.185
CLEAR GUIDANCE ABOUT WHERE YOU

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:28.454
WANT TO SEE CONFORMITY BETWEEN.

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:30.256
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND

01:55:30.323 --> 01:55:31.858
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES.

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.092
SO I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.595
OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER SHARE

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:36.729
BEST PRACTICES.

01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:39.098
BUT THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US HERE

01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:41.267
IT HAS EVEN GOTTEN TO THE POINT

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:42.335
OF BEING ABOUT.

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:43.002
WHAT?

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.404
HOW MUCH TIME DOES THE ECONOMIC

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:46.172
REGULATOR TAKE IN THIS CASE IT

01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:47.874
REALLY GETS BACK TO YOU WHOEVER

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.175
IS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE IS

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:50.743
GOING TO BE FACED WITH THE SAME

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:52.245
FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING FACTS?

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:53.379
THAT WE HAVE A VERY BIG

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.548
LIABILITY AND HAS TO BE PAID BY

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.483
SOMEONE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:59.018
THE PERSON MAKING THAT DECISION

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:00.520
AS YOU'VE JUST HIGHLIGHTED --

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:04.490
WHOEVER HAS TO MAKE THE DECISION

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:05.558
AND STILL THE SAME QUESTION.

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:06.125
AND SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:06.759
MORE ON FRIDAY BUT I THINK THAT

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:07.894
THERE ARE PERHAPS OTHER WAYS TO

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.262
GO ABOUT.

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:10.863
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:12.832
FISHING REGULATION -- THAN

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.701
CREATING A NEW.

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.669
A QUASI JUDICIAL BODY.

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:23.242
MY LAST QUESTION FROM A MIXTURE

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:23.543
[inaudible]

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:23.876
IT [inaudible]

01:56:23.943 --> 01:56:24.610
IS.

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:26.813
THE BIG ISSUE NOW IS TAKING CARE

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:29.248
OF THE VICTIMS.

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:32.118
WITH A BANKRUPT -- UTILITY.

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:34.020
SO THIS ISSUE OF INVERSE

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:36.522
CONDEMNATION THE ISSUE THE NEW

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:39.592
ELECTRIC UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD.

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:41.561
ALL OF THESE OTHER ISSUES.

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:43.496
SEEMSTO ME ARE SECONDARY RIGHT

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:45.131
NOW WE'RE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:47.400
PUT TOGETHER FUND -- FIGURE OUT

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:48.801
HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY.

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:49.902
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF

01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:52.538
THOSE WERE VICTIMS NOW.

01:56:52.605 --> 01:56:55.875
IS WOULD THAT BE ACCURATE.

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:57.276
I THINK TAKING CARE OF THE

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:58.378
VICTIMS NOW IS IMPORTANT I'LL

01:56:58.444 --> 01:56:59.078
I'LL MAKE THE FOLLOWING

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.580
OBSERVATION AND THOSE WHO ARE

01:57:00.646 --> 01:57:02.648
MORE DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN THE

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:04.417
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS CAN.

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:06.152
COMMENT ON THIS BUT IT'S MY

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:08.287
UNDERSTANDING THAT TO GET OUT OF

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:09.722
BANKRUPTCY.

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:11.624
THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:14.460
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT.

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:15.795
HOW THE SITUATION THAT GOT THE

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.330
UTILITY INTO BANKRUPTCY WHEN NOT

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:18.464
HAPPEN AGAIN?

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:20.433
AND SO I DO THINK THE REFORMS

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.901
COLLECTIVELY THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.069
ABOUT.

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.604
ARE IMPORTANT FOR A

01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:26.406
DEMONSTRATION ABOUT WHAT WILL BE

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:28.341
DIFFERENT THE NEXT TIME AND SO I

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:31.944
DO THINK THAT TAKING CARE OF THE

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:32.478
TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:34.614
EIGHTEEN VICTIMS.

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.449
IS TIED TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:37.950
TAKING CARE OF VICTIMS GOING

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:42.555
FORWARD -- THANK YEARS JUST

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.957
SIGNALING TO MY CHAIR OF THAT

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:51.130
JUST ONE FOLLOW UP THEM.

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.832
BUT I I WAS.

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:55.468
IF WE FIGURE OUT THIS.

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:58.371
KIDDING.

01:57:58.438 --> 01:57:59.872
IF IF WE FIGURE OUT THIS FUND

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:02.041
FOR NOW AND WE THEN WE HAVE NEW

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.109
RULES FOR THE THE THE THE

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:04.110
PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD.

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:06.579
SO THAT THE UTILITY WHEN THEY

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.281
REALLY HAVE BEEN PRUDENT.

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:11.517
CAN THEN GO TO THE UC TO TRY TO

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:15.988
GET THAT -- THEIR COST.

01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:18.724
SWITCHED OVER TO WERE.

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:21.627
HANDED OVER TO THE RATE PAYERS --

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.496
IF WE HAVE THAT.

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:24.897
I REALLY AM LOOKING FOR TO MAKE

01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:27.600
SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT SAYING

01:58:27.667 --> 01:58:28.167
WITH THE COMMISSION IS NOT

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:29.335
SAYING IS THE INVERSE

01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:30.303
CONDEMNATION.

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:31.771
WE GOT TO GET RID OF INVERSE

01:58:31.838 --> 01:58:33.372
CONDEMNATION THAT'S THE THE CURE

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:36.075
ALL FOR ALL OF OUR ILLS BECAUSE

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:38.678
IT CERTAINLY IS NOT I THINK THAT

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:38.978
[inaudible]

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:41.881
THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION CAUSES

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:44.517

ALONE.

01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:53.326
BUT IF THE IF IN DEALING WITH A

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:55.828
CAUSE IS OFF THE TABLE YOU MUST

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:57.830

OF DEALING WITH THE EFFECT.

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:38.571
NOT DEALING WITH THE COSTS BUT

01:59:38.638 --> 01:59:40.206
THE CAUSE WAS THE FACT THAT THE

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.674
UTILITIES WERE NOT DOING WHAT

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:44.076
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IN

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:45.177
THE FIRST PLACE BUT MA'AM IT

MY OPINION INVERSE CONDEMNATION

01:59:55.922 --> 02:00:01.427
WHICH IS.

02:00:01.494 --> 02:00:02.962
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING.

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:04.330
IT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE

02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:04.897
HIGH LEVEL POINT THAT MISTER

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:05.364
KHAN IS MAKING BUT MY

02:00:05.431 --> 02:00:06.999
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EVEN WITH

02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:07.833
REFORM.

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:08.634
THERE IS STILL OPPORTUNITY TO

02:00:08.701 --> 02:00:09.569
LITIGATE THESE ISSUES IN COURT

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:10.169
AND SO.

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:11.304
THEREFORE YOU WILL SEE

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:11.904
POTENTIALLY APPLICATIONS FOR

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:12.505
COST RECOVERY STILL COMING TO

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:13.172
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:15.441
EVEN IF YOU CHANGE THAT STANDARD.

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:16.809
AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS I

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:18.177
MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS I THINK

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:20.279
ALL AT LEAST THREE TYPES OF

02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:21.380
RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:23.149
ASH CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE IN

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:26.686
COMPLEMENT HOW BIG A A FUNDER

BE AFFECTED BY -- WHETHER YOU'RE

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:32.592
CHANGING FIRST OR NOT BUT I

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:34.327
AGREE THAT IT IS NOT A CATCH ALL.

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.728
AND THAT WE DID HAVE A

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:38.698
STAKEHOLDERS TO RAISE CONCERN

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:39.432
ABOUT THAT CHANGE.

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:41.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND WAS

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:00.853
FROM A COMMUNITY THAT WAS

INSURANCE FIRST AND THEN.

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:11.964
WELFARE RISK GOING FORWARD SO.

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:12.999

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.417

IF YOUR NEIGHBOR LOSES HIS

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:36.088
INSURANCE IS NOT A BIG DEAL YOU

YOU LOSE YOUR INSURANCE THAT'S A

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:37.923
CRISIS.

02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:40.159
THE NUMBER THERE'S A SURGE IN

02:01:40.226 --> 02:01:41.661
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

02:01:41.727 --> 02:01:43.529
GOING TO THE FAIR PLAN WE'RE

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:46.032
PRETTY DARN CLOSE TO A CRISIS.

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:47.633
A WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE ZIP

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:49.101
CODES.

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:50.336
LOSING THEIR INSURANCE

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:52.738
REGARDLESS OF THE PROPERTY IN

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:54.573
THE INSURANCE WHETHER OR NOT

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:56.742
THEY'VE TAKEN EFFORTS. TO TO TRY

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.411
TO MITIGATE FIRE RISK WE HAVE A

02:01:58.477 --> 02:02:00.813
PROBLEM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.314
THING THAT'S GOING TO SPREAD.

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.016
LIKE A VIRUS POTENTIALLY --

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:05.518
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:07.820
AND SO I JUST I JUST PUT THAT

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.555
OUT THERE I WILL SAY TO THAT.

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:11.691
WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM PART

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:13.559
OF OUR CONVERSATIONS -- WITH

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:15.261
REGARDS TO INSURANCE.

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:17.863
IS THAT SHOULD PEOPLE TAKE

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:21.701
EFFORTS TO REDUCE RISKS WHERE

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.302
WILL INSURANCE BE WILL THERE BE

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:24.770
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.839
POSITIVE BENEFITS OF INCENTIVIZE

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.040
YOU TO HOMEOWNERS.

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:29.842
IF THEY'RE DOING THE WORK AND

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:31.977
THEY'RE LOSING THEIR INSURANCE

02:02:32.044 --> 02:02:33.479
THAT'S HARDLY AN INCENTIVE AND

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:35.548
THAT IS THAT IS FRUSTRATING AND

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:37.216
JUST SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS WHAT

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:38.217
YOU SAID.

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:40.052

REAL ESTATE OFFER IS ACCEPTED.

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:48.260
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD BUT I

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:49.729
CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT WOULD BE

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:53.833
REALLY HARD TO GET PASSED IN

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.568
THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:57.369
I'M NOT AND AND AND MAYBE I'M

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:58.471
WRONG.

02:02:58.537 --> 02:03:00.539
BUT YOU'RE NOT OKAY.

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:01.507
WE USE YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:02.174

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:04.443
INSURANCE CONDITIONS FOR THE

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:06.045

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:07.546
COULDN'T I COULDN'T AGREE MORE

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:10.249
AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND WE

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.651
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IF WE ARE

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:13.853
GOING TO IMPROVE FIRE RISK

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:14.887
CONDITIONS.

02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:16.088
WE NEED THE INSURANCE SOME

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:18.724
COMPANIES TO WORK WITH US ON

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:20.659
THAT AND AND MIKE I I I DON'T

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:22.294

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:24.029
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OF

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:28.067

CALIFORNIA -- YOU TALK ABOUT AND

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:34.440
RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDATION

02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:36.475

PREVENTION MITIGATION EFFORTS

02:03:40.846 --> 02:03:41.547
NOW WE DID.

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:43.015
PUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:45.484

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:54.560
ON THERE AS I RECALL IN THAT

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:56.529

THE THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:06.505
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN FIRE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.140
AND WHILE FOR MEDICATION GOING

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:10.709
FORWARD -- THE END MISTER KHAN

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.545
YOU TALKED ABOUT A WILDFIRE

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:15.047
BOARD FOR YOU TILL AT EASE --

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:15.848
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:18.384
A WILDFIRE BOARD FOR CITIZENS

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:20.886
SORT PEOPLE OUT THERE TRYING.

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:22.688
TO AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:24.757
TO DO AND THE REASON I CUT I

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:27.226
BRING THAT UP IS -- YOU NUMBER.

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:28.961
EIGHTEEN TALK TO SAYS TAKE

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:29.461
ACTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:30.362
INCREASED.

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.264
CONSISTENCY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:33.499
MAINTENANCE LAWS.

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:38.304
A LOT OF FIRES HAVE BEEN IN THE

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.071
S. R. RAY.

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.172
AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:40.606
THAT WE FACE IS THAT

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:43.042
CALIFORNIA'S.

02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:44.610
OUR GREATEST THEIR JOBS BUT

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:45.578
THEY'RE UNDER MANNED AND

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.680
UNDERSTAFFED AND SO WHEN FIRE

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.849
SEASON STARTS AND IF THERE'S A

02:04:49.915 --> 02:04:51.383
FIRE THOSE PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.518
OUT AND DOING PROPERTY

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:54.720
INSPECTIONS AND AND AND TRAINING

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:56.455
COURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS.

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:57.890
THEIR GOD.

02:04:57.957 --> 02:04:58.991
AND THEY DON'T THEY WON'T BE

02:04:59.058 --> 02:05:01.126
BACK FOR A LONG TIME.

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.329
AND SO WE DO ANY TALK ABOUT

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:06.665
RESOURCES WE NEED MANPOWER

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:08.467
DEDICATED MANPOWER THEY CAN BE

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:10.402
YEAR ROUND TO HELP WITH

02:05:10.469 --> 02:05:11.804
INSPECTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE.

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:12.872
N..

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:15.007
N. AS WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW IF.

02:05:15.074 --> 02:05:16.308
YOU LOOK AT COMMUNITIES OUT

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:17.810
THERE WHO CAN MITIGATE FIRE RISK

02:05:17.877 --> 02:05:20.412
WEALTHY COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:22.414
DO WELL BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:23.082
WEALTHY AND THAT THAT THAT MIGHT

02:05:23.148 --> 02:05:24.016
HELP.

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.784
BUT POORER COMMUNITIES ARE GOING

02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:26.619
TO STRUGGLE.

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.120
WITH THAT AND SO WHEN YOU DO

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:29.889
THINGS LIKE FIRE HARDENING AND

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:32.625
DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT'S EXPENSIVE.

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:35.027
AND AND AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE AN

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:36.996
PARTICULARLY IN AND POTENTIALLY

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:38.564
IN THE A LOT OF THE S. R. AREAS.

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:40.699
THAT THAT GETTING TO REDUCE THAT

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:42.735
RISK IS GOING TO BE GOING TO BE

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:44.136
CHALLENGING.

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:47.373
I THINK YOU ADD -- TO AND MISTER

02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:49.108
MISTER PATTERSON IS NOT HERE HE

02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:50.609
TALKED ABOUT PRE POSITIONING AND

02:05:50.676 --> 02:05:51.911
YOU KNOW GET MORE FIREFIGHTERS

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:53.812
OUT THERE I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:54.613
PREVENTION.

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.282
AND AND THROWING MASSIVE

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:57.783
RESOURCES AT THAT SO WE DON'T

02:05:57.850 --> 02:06:00.519
HAVE TO HAVE A HUGE YOU KNOW A

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.454
MASSIVE MASSIVE FIREFIGHTING

02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:03.389
FORCE.

02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.524
THAT THAT WE FEEDING CLOSER THAN

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:07.493
AND AND TAKE CARE OF FOR EVER I

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.161
SO I'M I'M VERY MUCH IN THE

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:10.496
PREVENTION PART OF IT.

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:12.331
BUT SOME OF THIS GOES BACK TO A

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:15.668
CONCERN THAT THAT THAT I HAVE --

02:06:15.734 --> 02:06:18.404
THAT THAT OTHERS HAVE IS IS

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:19.705
UTILITY BEHAVIOR.

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:22.408
AND A TRUST IN THE UTILITY TO DO

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:23.876
THE RIGHT THING.

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:26.245
AND I AM CONCERNED THAT AS WE GO

02:06:26.312 --> 02:06:28.080
FORWARD WITH THESE WILD FIRE

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:28.781
MITIGATION PLANS.

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.449
THAT.

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:33.085
SOME UTILITIES MAY START TO TRY

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:35.487
TO CUT CORNERS.

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:38.424
AND THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR WE

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:39.925
WANT TO INCENTIVIZE.

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:41.327
MATTER OF FACT WE NEED TO STOP

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:42.328
THAT.

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:44.196
IN ITS TRACKS IF WE BEGIN TO SEE

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.731
SIGNS OF THAT.

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:47.333
BECAUSE IT'S THAT BEHAVIOR

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:49.001
CUTTING CORNERS THAT GODDESS

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.436
PARTLY INTO THE MESS WE'RE IN

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:51.670
NOW.

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.305
AND SO WE DO NOT.

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:55.140
TAKE ADVANTAGE AND AND AND PUSH

02:06:55.207 --> 02:06:57.309
BACK WHEN THEY'RE A TIME IF

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:58.610
THERE'S A TEMP TO DOWNGRADE OF

02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:01.647
FIRE MITIGATION PLAN OR YOU KNOW

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.615
THE LAST MOMENT MAYBE CHANGE

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:05.784
SOMETHING IN -- AND AND NOT

02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:07.786
REALLY STUDY THE THE IMPACTS OF

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:09.555
THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY REALLY

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:11.156
CAREFUL THAT SOMEBODY'S OUT

02:07:11.223 --> 02:07:12.891
THERE NOT TRYING TO PULL ONE

02:07:12.958 --> 02:07:15.561
OVER ON US AND PUT US AT FURTHER

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:17.062
RISK SO -- WHY DON'T HAVE A

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.198
QUESTION FOR YOU -- THESE THESE

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:21.633
ARE THESE ARE ARE MORE COMMENTS

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:25.337
AND I BUT I DO I DO -- I DO

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:26.038
APPRECIATE.

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:27.740
MISTER KHAN SAID ABOUT THE

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:28.941
POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:30.876
MARSHAL UP SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:32.745
AND REALLY ATTACK THIS AND GO

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.646
BACK TO NONE OF US WERE HERE --

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:35.814
IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THIS

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:39.018
HAPPENED BUT AFTER THE THE EARTH

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.219
THE THE LARGE EARTHQUAKE AND

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.053
NORTHRIDGE WE MARSHALL

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:44.423
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND NOW

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:45.124
YOU SEE.

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.058
CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.459
AND AND UPGRADES AND THINGS THAT

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:49.028
HAPPEN PRETTY QUICKLY.

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:50.963
WE NEED I THINK WE NEED TO DO

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:52.965
THAT FOR THIS AS WELL.

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.299
THANK YOU MAY I OFFER JUST A

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:56.035
COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS IN

02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:57.136
RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS.

02:07:57.202 --> 02:07:58.404
FIRST SO I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP

02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:00.305
INSURANCE AND I KEEP GOING BACK

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.306
TO HOW DO WE MANAGE RISK

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.574
NORMALLY IT'S WITH INSURANCE

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:05.144
RIGHT AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:06.812
WITH HERE IS THAT.

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.547
THESE THIS RISK IS SO GREAT THAT

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:10.449
INSURANCE MARKETS INCREASINGLY

02:08:10.516 --> 02:08:11.650
DON'T WANT TO COVER IT.

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:13.585
AND THE INSURANCE MARKET FOR THE

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:15.087
UTILITIES THEMSELVES AND CRISIS

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:17.723
SO AGAIN AT HISTORICALLY UTILITY

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:18.991
INSURANCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COVER

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:21.360
THE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:23.328
IT NO LONGER IS ABLE TO DO SO

02:08:23.395 --> 02:08:25.697
AND THERE'S VERY FEW MAYBE ONE

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:27.733
OR TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.001
WILL NOW WORK WITH UTILITIES AND

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:30.369
WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM A

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:32.471
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY THAT

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:34.273
CANNOT GET INSURANCE -- AND SO

02:08:34.339 --> 02:08:35.707
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AND

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:37.810
SO THEN THAT LEADS TO HOW TO USE

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:38.877
HOW DO WE GET THE INSURANCE

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.579
INDUSTRY BACK INTO DOING WHAT

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:41.780
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:08:41.847 --> 02:08:43.315
HELPING MANAGE THIS RISK.

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:44.249
AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY

02:08:44.316 --> 02:08:45.751
FROM A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE

02:08:45.818 --> 02:08:47.186
COMPANIES AND I IMAGINE IT'S THE

02:08:47.252 --> 02:08:48.821
SAME FOR RESIDENTIAL.

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:49.888
IS THAT IF THERE CAN BE AN

02:08:49.955 --> 02:08:52.458
OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE RISK

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:53.826
THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO COME

02:08:53.892 --> 02:08:55.160
AND PUT THEIR CAPITAL AT RISK

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.196
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:59.064
WHETHER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.632
ONE A TWENTY YEAR EVENT OR ONE

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:01.767
IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OF

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:01.967
THAT.

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:03.669
WHICH IS WHY ARE CHAPTER REALLY

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:05.804
GETS INTO WIDE THE INABILITY TO

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.306
MODEL UNDERSTAND THIS IS SO

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:08.707
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T

02:09:08.774 --> 02:09:10.642
UNDERSTAND THIS RISK IT IS VERY

02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:12.711
HARD FOR INSURANCE TO PRICE IT

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:13.312
SO THEY WON'T COME IN AT ANY

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:14.113
PRICE POINT.

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.247
SO WITH REGARD TO THE

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:17.883
RECOMMENDATION TO INVEST MORE IN

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:18.884
MITIGATION.

02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:20.452
IS PARTLY TIED TO THAT WHICH IS

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:22.287
BOTH A DEMONSTRATION BY THE

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:24.022
STATE TO INVEST AS MUCH AS

02:09:24.089 --> 02:09:26.024
POSSIBLE IN A MEDICATION I THINK

02:09:26.091 --> 02:09:27.059
WILL BE PERCEIVED POLICY

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:29.495
POSITIVELY BY THE COMMERCIAL AND

02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:30.462
RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE THAT.

02:09:30.529 --> 02:09:32.798
COMMUNITIES AND MAKE IT EASIER

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:34.967
TO HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE --

02:09:35.033 --> 02:09:37.169
WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:38.737
THAT SHOULD BE I CAN'T SAY ALL I

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:39.705
CAN SAY IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:41.940
ABOUT TEN YEARS FOR MITIGATION

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:43.008
TO COME INTO AFFECTED SO IF YOU

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:44.409
WANT TO MAKE THAT TIME LINE

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:45.110
FASTER.

02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:47.246
OR HAVE THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE

02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:49.982
UTILITY EFFORTS THEN -- IT'S

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:55.921
WORTH THINKING ABOUT WHAT MORE

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:57.823
DOLLARS IN THAT AREA WOULD DO.

02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:58.423
AND THEN I WANNA MAKE A LAST

02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.224
COMMENT ABOUT UTILITY BEHAVIOR

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:00.225
AND THE CONCERN THERE AND THAT

02:10:00.292 --> 02:10:04.863
IS ALWAYS A CONCERN -- WHEN I?

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:06.732
I DO NOT IT IS NOT IN THE

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.500
UTILITIES INTERESTS TO HAVE WILD

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:11.203
FIRES IT SIMPLY ISN'T EVEN IF

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.837
THE COST GET RECOVERED

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:12.137
[inaudible]

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:15.374
THEY LOSE INVESTORS THEY HAVE

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.608
DIFFERENT TYPES OF INVESTORS

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:18.177
THIS IS NOT A SITUATION ANY

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.712
UTILITY WANTS TO BE AN AND SO I

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:21.246
THINK THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:24.683
INCENTIVE. TO DO EVERYTHING

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:27.553
POSSIBLE AND TO NOT CUT CORNERS.

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.288
AND I WOULD KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

02:10:29.354 --> 02:10:31.590
HASN'T BEEN A FULL REVIEW OF THE

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:32.858
RECENT FIRES AND WHAT THE

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:34.326
UTILITIES COULD HAVE OR SHOULD

02:10:34.393 --> 02:10:35.527
HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:36.562
AND SO I WANT TO RESERVE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.330
JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:39.798
OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE INTO

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:42.568
THAT REVIEW IS DONE -- BUT WHEN

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:43.969
WE LOOK AT ANY -- GAS ELECTRIC

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:46.104
FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS HIGHLIGHTED

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:47.372
FOR THE WORK THEY'VE DONE WHAT

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:50.642
THEY'VE REALLY INVESTED IN ISN'T.

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.778
SYSTEM HARDENING IT'S WILD FIRE

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:53.879
DETECTION.

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:56.181
COM AND THE ABILITY.

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:57.416
TO TURN OFF THE SYSTEM TO

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:59.451
DEACTIVATE THE SYSTEM WHEN

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:01.186
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR A FIRE.

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.988
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN.

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:04.356
THE UTILITY INVESTING

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:05.557
SIGNIFICANTLY AND SAFER POLES

02:11:05.624 --> 02:11:07.559
AND WIRES I DO WANT TO MAKE THAT

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:08.193
DISTINCTION.

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.928
THE THE P. YOU SEE THE

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.897
LEGISLATURE TO NOT ORDER ALL

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:13.899
UTILITIES TO FOLLOW THAT PATH --

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:15.300
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ORDER THEM TO

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:16.835
INVEST IN PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS

02:11:16.902 --> 02:11:18.203
AND SO I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:19.371
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UTILITY

02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:21.673
BEHAVIOR. TO TO REALLY EXAMINE

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:22.841
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO

02:11:22.908 --> 02:11:24.276
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE DONE

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:25.244
THAT VERSUS WHAT WE WISH THEY

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:27.212
HAD DONE OR WISH WE WISH WE HAD

02:11:27.279 --> 02:11:28.447
ASKED THEM TO DO.

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:31.049
SO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT.

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:33.919
EVERYTHING YOU SAID [inaudible]

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.887
HI.

02:11:35.954 --> 02:11:37.055
IS THAT CODE IN A REPORT YOU'LL

02:11:37.122 --> 02:11:39.558
SEE SUBSTANTIATION PORT AN

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.260
ASSEMBLY.

02:11:41.326 --> 02:11:42.327
WOMAN HIT REYES.

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:43.629
ARM THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PART

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.530
OF THIS PROCESS FOR THE

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:46.965
COMMISSIONERS WAS TO HEAR FROM

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:48.100
THE VICTIMS.

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.935
AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:52.638
ASPECTS OF BEING A VICTIM IS THE

02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:54.940
DEALING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES.

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.009
THE YEAH I AND I'M SURE THE

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:57.876
OTHER COMMISSIONERS I VISITED

02:11:57.943 --> 02:12:03.115
THE SITES AND TALK TO BUT TO THE

02:12:03.181 --> 02:12:04.316
VICTIMS.

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:05.584
YOUR EVERYTHING YOU SAID WE CAN

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:07.152
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BECAUSE IT'S

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:08.186
THE TRUTH.

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:10.922
F. BASE THIS IS A HORROR THIS IS

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:13.825
A HUMAN HORROR AND WE HEARD FROM

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:14.660
ONE PERSON WHO VICTIMIZE AFTER

02:12:14.726 --> 02:12:17.562
ANOTHER AND THE ESSENTIAL POINT

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:19.531
YOU MADE IS REALLY CRITICAL.

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:22.067
INSURANCE COMPANIES. FOR REASONS

02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:23.835
THAT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:26.305
ARE NOT PROVIDING SATISFACTORY

02:12:26.371 --> 02:12:27.806
EXPERIENCE AS FAR CITIZENS THEY

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:29.975
ARE VERY VERY UPSET AND

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.009
FRUSTRATED.

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:33.679
AND YOUR RIGHT ABOUT OUR STATE.

02:12:33.745 --> 02:12:34.780
ONE THING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:12:34.846 --> 02:12:36.315
FASCINATING ABOUT HOW WE

02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:37.182
SERVICES FIRES.

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:40.452
WE DO A GREAT JOB EVERYBODY SAYS

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:42.688
IN TRYING TO RUSH IN AND STOP

02:12:42.754 --> 02:12:43.555
THEM.

02:12:43.622 --> 02:12:46.291
WE DO A GREAT JOB IN THE

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:48.393
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH PROVIDING

SERVICES AND HELPING PEOPLE

02:12:50.362 --> 02:12:51.530
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:52.964
AND THEN WE ABANDON THESE

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.033
COMMUNITIES WE GIVE THEM PHONE

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.802
NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN'T ANSWER

02:12:56.868 --> 02:12:58.403
WE GIVE THEM FOR NUMBERS WITH

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:59.738
THE GET RECORDINGS WE GIVE THEM

02:12:59.805 --> 02:13:02.007
AGENCIES THAT DON'T GET FUNDED.

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:04.576
AND SO JUST SO THE RECORD IS

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.144
CLEAR.

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:06.645
THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:07.913
OPPORTUNITY.

THEN WE ARE OF THE BAND IN THESE

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.057
COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:20.959
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN.

02:13:21.026 --> 02:13:22.561
AND SUFFERING THAT'S GOING ON

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:25.263
FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT WE

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:27.632
DISCOVERED AND THAT'S FOR US TO

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:29.434
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

02:13:29.501 --> 02:13:30.669
AND JUST AS A FOLLOW UP THAT

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:31.336

PROCEDURE KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THAT

02:13:34.039 --> 02:13:36.308
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M LIVING

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:37.075
THROUGH WITH MY CONSTITUENTS.

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:40.512

REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND AND

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:53.792

TO SAY I I BELIEVE WE HAVE AS A

02:13:58.630 --> 02:14:00.899
STATE THE RESOURCES TO DO A

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:04.569
MASSIVE MEDICATION -- PLAN -- WE

02:14:04.636 --> 02:14:06.972
WE USED MONEY FROM OUR G. G. R.

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:10.375
F. FUND -- WHICH WAS NOT EASY

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:11.943
AND IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL TO A

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:14.413
LOT OF PEOPLE -- BUT THERE ARE

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:16.214
RESOURCES THERE FOR PREVENTION

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:17.682
AND PRIOR TO THAT YOU SAID THAT

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:21.019
WE DON'T USED ABOUT 2% OF OF

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:22.988
THAT MONEY FOR FIRE PREVENTION --

02:14:23.054 --> 02:14:24.790
IF YOU YOU SPEND ANY TIME AROUND

02:14:24.856 --> 02:14:26.525
THE FIRE ZONES YOU SAW.

02:14:26.591 --> 02:14:28.660
THE HORRIBLE AIR QUALITY THAT WE

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:30.195
EXPERIENCED IN THE MASSIVE

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:31.630
RELEASE OF CARBON INTO THE

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:32.798
ATMOSPHERE.

02:14:32.864 --> 02:14:34.666
QUITE FRANKLY I CAN THINK OF NO

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:36.635
GREATER INVESTMENT IN REDUCING

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:38.003
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:40.105
HELPING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF

02:14:40.172 --> 02:14:42.340
FIRE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT -- AND I

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:45.243
I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE AND DOWN

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.912
DOWN THE PATH TO DO THAT BUT WE

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:49.414
ALSO -- AND IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:52.017
ME IS IS IS CHANGING BEHAVIOR.

02:14:52.083 --> 02:14:54.653
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD --

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:56.254
THAT THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:57.823
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THAT I

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:58.423
WANT TO CLEAR SOMETHING FROM

02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:59.090
AROUND THEIR HOUSE.

02:14:59.157 --> 02:15:00.192
THEY'RE THEY'RE ATTACHED TO

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:01.860
THEIR FAVORITE TREE AND I AND I

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:03.728
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I I DO AND I

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:06.998
BECAUSE I I AS I AM AS WELL --

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:10.335
BUT BUT INTO WE BEGAN TO TO FIND

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.837
A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE CHANGE

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:13.171
BEHAVIOR.

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:15.040
THE RISK IN SOME AREAS IS NOT

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.475
GOING TO GO DOWN.

02:15:16.541 --> 02:15:19.044
AND AND THAT IS THAT IS OF OF

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.846
GRAVE CONCERN -- UP THERE

02:15:20.912 --> 02:15:22.481
BECAUSE PEOPLE SIMPLY ARE

02:15:22.547 --> 02:15:24.349
RESISTANT TO CHANGE CHANGING

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:26.351
THEIR BEHAVIOR -- AND OUR

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:28.553
ABILITY TO DO INSPECTIONS AND

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:31.122
FOLLOW UP IS VERY LIMITED BY OUR

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:33.959
LACK OF PERSONNEL THE CINEMA

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:34.793
COUNTY TO THEIR CREDIT

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.093
[inaudible]

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:36.228
HIS NOW.

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:38.196
MADE F. MAKING AN EFFORT TO TO

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:40.999
EXAMINE OR TO DO INSPECTIONS ON

02:15:41.066 --> 02:15:41.600
THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:45.971
THIS YEAR -- AND AND AROUND FIRE

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.239
MITIGATION AROUND FIRE

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:49.174
PROTECTION IN THE CITY THAT I

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:50.308
USED TO LIVE IN.

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:52.010
IF YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR VEGETATION

02:15:52.077 --> 02:15:53.411
MANAGEMENT.

02:15:53.478 --> 02:15:55.480
THE FIRE EVENTUALLY CAN'T YOU

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:56.715
GOT TAG YOU DIDN'T GET YOU

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:59.417
DIDN'T RESPOND TO THAT THEY CAME

02:15:59.484 --> 02:16:00.018
IN THEY CLEANED IT UP AND THEY

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:00.418
SENT YOU A BILL.

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:01.953
BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.755
PROTECTING YOUR PROPERTY.

02:16:03.822 --> 02:16:05.023
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DO FOR YOUR

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:05.991
NEIGHBOR AND YOU CAN HAVE THE

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:07.926
BEST PROTECTED PROPERTY IN THE

02:16:07.993 --> 02:16:09.294
WORLD IF YOUR NEIGHBOR DOESN'T

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:10.795
DO THAT YOU'RE AT RISK.

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:11.997
IT'S MEANT YOU'RE A TERRIBLE

02:16:12.063 --> 02:16:14.232
RISK AND SO SO ANYWAY I'M SORRY

02:16:14.299 --> 02:16:14.833
GET OFF ON A SOAPBOX BUT THIS

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.935
PART. TO ME IS IS IMPORTANT AND

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:19.271
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- HOW

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:21.006
WE HOW WE WORK TOGETHER WITH

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:22.474
INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE?

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:24.142
HOW WE ENSURE THERE IS INSURANCE

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.644
FOR PEOPLE AND JUST TO YOU

02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:31.583
UNDERSTAND HISTORY -- WE WE

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:32.651
TRUST ME THERE WERE A LOT OF

02:16:32.717 --> 02:16:34.686
EFFORTS LAST YEAR AND MOST OF

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:37.255
THEM MOST OF THEM DIDN'T GO VERY

02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:38.757
FAR QUITE FRANKLY.

02:16:38.823 --> 02:16:41.293
AND IT IS SO YOUR POINT.

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:42.961
ABOUT THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT THE

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:46.331
REALITY IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:46.765
TO INSTITUTE CHANGE.

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:49.134
THANK YOU.

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:49.935
BECAUSE TAKE A MOMENT TO RESPOND

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:51.570
TO THAT TO ME BECAUSE WE WE

02:16:51.636 --> 02:16:53.238
DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE INSURANCE.

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:56.107
A WORK GROUP MEMBERS HERE AND IS

02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:56.741
THIS ON THE PART OF A GOOD IF I

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:58.009
COULD MAKE IT VERY BRIEF BECAUSE

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:59.844
AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING IT'S

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:00.645
NOT A COMMITTEE THAT HAS A

02:17:00.712 --> 02:17:02.080
JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:03.515
MATTER BUT ABSOLUTELY.

02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:05.016
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:17:05.083 --> 02:17:07.452
HIGHLIGHT THE INTO THE REPORT.

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:08.119
THAT AND THAT IN PARTICULAR THAT

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:08.453
WE'RE GROUP.

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:09.955
RECOGNIZES THE CHANGES IN THE

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.256
MARKETS I THINK AT THE MOMENT

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:13.858
AND AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:15.493
THE WAY THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.662
IS REGULATED. TO HELP FORTIFY

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:19.130
THAT MARKET TO FORTIFY BOTH

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:20.865
AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:22.367
AND ONE OF THE KEY PIECES AS YOU

02:17:22.434 --> 02:17:24.536
SAID IT IS USING THOSE MARKETS

02:17:24.603 --> 02:17:26.204
TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR AND

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:28.673
THE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER.

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:30.041
IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AB.

02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:30.809
NO IN THE SECTION IT'S

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:32.143
RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDATION SIX

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:35.046
AND SEVEN IS TO LOOK AT SETTING

02:17:35.113 --> 02:17:37.282
STANDARDS BOTH FOR HOME AND

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:38.617
COMMUNITY.

02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:40.018
MITIGATION THAT WOULD THEN BE

02:17:40.085 --> 02:17:41.753
PAID TO A REQUIREMENT FOR THE

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:45.090
INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO OFFER --

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:46.992
TO TO OFFER UP THAT POLICIES TO

02:17:47.058 --> 02:17:47.926
THOSE COMMITTEES A IF THEY MET

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:49.194
BOTH OF THOSE STANDARDS AND I

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:50.061
THINK THAT ADDRESSES A

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.229
SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THIS

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.564
QUESTION WHICH IS.

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:55.600
HOW YOU INCENTIVIZE?

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:57.702
GOOD BEHAVIOR.

02:17:57.769 --> 02:18:00.739
SO TO AND PUT THAT POOR

02:18:00.805 --> 02:18:02.207
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:02.941
A MISTER CUNNINGHAM.

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:05.343
AND THEN -- IF I COULD IF THERE

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:06.111
WERE WE WILL THEN MOVE.

02:18:06.177 --> 02:18:14.519
QUICKLY TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO ON

02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:16.354
THE SECOND.

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:18.023
NO I THINK -- I DON'T THINK ANY

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:18.790
OTHER MEMBER.

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:20.692
I HAD A QUESTION SO WILL TURN TO

02:18:20.759 --> 02:18:22.327
YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE.

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:24.963
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.864
WITH RESPECT TO INVERSE SEEMS

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:28.366
LIKE THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS.

02:18:28.433 --> 02:18:29.968
WELL THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:30.535
BUT THERE'S THE CAN WE AS A

02:18:30.602 --> 02:18:31.870
LEGISLATURE DO SOMETHING TO

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:32.337
CHANGE THAT.

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:33.438
AS A POLICY MATTER AND THEN

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:34.105
THERE'S THE SHOULD WAY WHICH IS

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:35.807
A POLICY OF POLITICAL QUESTION

02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:36.574
WHICH IS VERY VERY DICEY. TO SAY

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:38.543
THE LEAST BUT ON THAT CAN WE

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.979
PIECE AND THIS IS JUST AN AND

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:41.513
ONE PICK UP ON YOUR LEGAL

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:42.647
ANALYSIS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:44.049
OPINION IF I FOLLOWED IT

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:44.616
CORRECTLY IS.

02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:47.018
THAT WELL IN VERSE HAS SOME

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:49.220
ROOTS IN THE CONSTITUTION IT WAS

02:18:49.287 --> 02:18:51.690
A CREATURE OF JUDICIAL

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:53.558
CONSTRUCTION WITH BY TWO

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:55.293
APPELLATE COURTS OF THE SIX

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.361
INTERMEDIATE LEVEL APPELLATE

02:18:56.428 --> 02:18:57.562
COURTS IN THE STATE.

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.597
IT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESS CORRECT

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:02.901
BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:03.468
AND THEREFORE OUR OPINION I

02:19:03.535 --> 02:19:04.335
BELIEVE IF I UNDERSTOOD

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:07.272
CORRECTLY IS THAT IT COULD BE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:09.708
ALTERED BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:11.342
WHAT I DIDN'T FALL THOUGH IS --

02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:12.744
YOU HAVE THAT WERE CORRECT SO

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:15.480
FAR YES OKAY CORRECT I WOULD SAY

02:19:15.547 --> 02:19:16.047
THAT.

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:18.249
COM THAT'S CORRECT AND ALSO I

02:19:18.316 --> 02:19:19.951
THINK VERY IMPORTANTLY.

02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:22.454
ON IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:24.622
CONTEXT.

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:26.524
THAT WE ARE FACING.

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:27.992
THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHAT WAS IT

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:28.993
IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.428
OF A MONOPOLY IT UTILITIES

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:31.830
BEFORE WE DE REGULATED.

02:19:31.896 --> 02:19:33.798
AND IT WAS ADDRESSED NOT IN THE

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:36.034
CONTEXT OF THE EMERGENCY AND THE

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:37.602
REASON THAT MATTERS IS BECAUSE

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:39.104
THERE'S A LINE OF AUTHORITY IN

02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:41.072
THE FLOOD CASES.

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:44.609
WHERE THE COURTS AT THAT AGAIN I

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.411
ACKNOWLEDGE THE OPPORTUNITY OF

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:47.879
THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND TO A

02:19:47.946 --> 02:19:50.148
CNSOLIDATED EMERGENCY TO ALTER

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:51.950
THE CONCEPTS OF INVERSE SO IS IT

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:54.986
BECAUSE IF I FALL CORRECTLY IS A

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:55.787
BECAUSE OF?

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:57.922
THE EMERGENCY NATURE OF THE FIRE

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:00.225
HAZARD THAT WE THE LEGISLATIVE.

02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:02.360
ACTION WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:04.596
THAT FEEL SO IF YOU ASK NINE

02:20:04.662 --> 02:20:06.231
LAWYERS YOU CAN GET.

02:20:06.297 --> 02:20:07.499
YOU KNOW EIGHT OPINIONS BUT I

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.000
ONLY HAVE ONE GOOD ONE I'M

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.769
TALKING TO RIGHT OKAY.

02:20:10.835 --> 02:20:13.471
WHAT WE ARE SURE WE RECEIVE WE

02:20:13.538 --> 02:20:15.006
RECEIVE IT WILL PASS ON TO YOU?

02:20:15.073 --> 02:20:16.775
EXTENSIVE LEGAL BRIEFING THAT

02:20:16.841 --> 02:20:18.843
SUPPORTED THE POSITION THAT YOU

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:21.846
CAN DO THIS AND IT IS MY OPINION.

02:20:21.913 --> 02:20:23.815
HAVING BEEN A LAWYER HERE FOR

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:25.216
FORTY SOME YEARS THAT.

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:27.652
THE LEGISLATURE CAN ANNOUNCE A

02:20:27.719 --> 02:20:30.421
UNIQUE EMERGENCY AND CAN.

02:20:30.488 --> 02:20:31.856
STAND UP AND AGREE WITH THE

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:32.624
GOVERNOR THAT THERE'S THE

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:33.892
EMERGENCY AND THAT WE ARE GOING

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:36.261
TO HAVE A CONSOLIDATED RESPONSE

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:36.628
TO IT.

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:38.830
AND AND ORGANIZE THE STATE I

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.532
BELIEVE AND THAT'S NOT A POLICY

02:20:40.598 --> 02:20:41.733
THAT'S ILLEGAL I BELIEVE YOU

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.101
COULD DO THAT.

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:45.737
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I IT IS MY

02:20:45.804 --> 02:20:46.838
BEST GUESS THE SUPREME COURT

02:20:46.905 --> 02:20:48.873
WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT BECAUSE

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:51.109
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR ANY

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:52.677
SUPREME COURT UNITED STATES FOR

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.379
CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE A GOVERNOR

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:56.214
AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:58.917
ANNOUNCE A GENUINE EMERGENCY AND

02:20:58.983 --> 02:21:00.351
FOR THOSE COURTS TO INTERFERE

02:21:00.418 --> 02:21:03.121
ESPECIALLY WHERE THEY HAD NEVER.

02:21:03.188 --> 02:21:04.823
THE SUPREME COURT IS NEVER

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:05.423
COMMENTED ON THIS AND I WILL

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:06.758
MAKE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:08.493
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.862
NO OTHER STATE DOES THIS FORTY

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:11.563
NINE OTHER STATES HAVE

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:13.364
CONSTITUTIONS THAT READ THE SAME

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:15.166
WAY OURS DOES BUT NOBODY ELSE

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:16.868
INTERPRETS THIS WAY AND THE

02:21:16.935 --> 02:21:18.203
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO IT

02:21:18.269 --> 02:21:18.870
THIS WAY.

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:21.472
SO WE ARE ADOPTING A POLICY

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:24.142
LEGALLY THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:26.511
ACCEPTED SO I THINK IF YOU GO TO

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:28.880
THE SUPREME COURT AND YOU SAY

02:21:28.947 --> 02:21:31.349
IT'S A BLANK SLATE. FORTY NINE

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:35.353
OTHER STATES DO WITH THE OTHER

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.821
WAY YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE.

02:21:36.888 --> 02:21:39.524
OKAY I THINK ALABAMA HAS ITS I

02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:40.391
DON'T WANT.

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:41.559
TO YEAH THE L. THAT WAS UNIQUE

02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:43.828
SITUATION BESIDES LAST TIME I

02:21:43.895 --> 02:21:44.395
LOOK WE DON'T FOLLOW ALABAMA

02:21:44.462 --> 02:21:45.563
MUCH.

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:46.464
SO SO IT YOU'RE GET SO THIS

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.098
WOULD.

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:48.633
ALMOST CERTAINLY BE LITIGATED AS

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.834
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK ALLUDED.

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:51.336
TO AND YOUR BELIEF IS WHEN IT

02:21:51.402 --> 02:21:53.805
WENT WHEN AS A GOES UP ON APPEAL.

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:55.607
THAT WHEN AT BY THE TIME IT GOT

02:21:55.673 --> 02:21:57.675
TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

02:21:57.742 --> 02:21:58.676
THE COURT WOULD A CENTURY SO

02:21:58.743 --> 02:21:59.644
SHOW DEFERENCE TO THE

02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:01.412
LEGISLATIVE ACTION BECAUSE IT'S

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.381
NEVER ACTUALLY -- FORMALLY

02:22:03.448 --> 02:22:05.583
ENDORSED INVERSE I THINK THAT

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:09.854
THE COURT WOULD SAY THAT ON AS

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.556
IT THE S. SIDE.

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:12.690
NOT TO BE YOU KNOW TO GRAVE

02:22:12.757 --> 02:22:13.324
ABOUT IT I THINK THE COURT WOULD

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:15.059
SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:16.461
DISABLED FROM PROTECTING ITSELF.

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:18.529
THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:19.097
THREAT AND WERE ALLOWED TO

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:21.065
PROTECT OURSELVES I ALSO BELIEVE

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:23.668
THAT ARE THERE ARE LEGAL EXPERTS

02:22:23.735 --> 02:22:26.504
AVAILABLE TO YOU -- ARE THAT CAN

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:28.172
THAT THAT AGREE WITH MY POSITION

02:22:28.239 --> 02:22:30.141
I I THINK THAT ARE THERE PEOPLE

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:32.176
DISAGREE I ALSO THINK THERE'S

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:34.212
WAYS THAT WE COULD EXPEDITE ARM

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:36.514
OUR REVIEW ON THIS.

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:38.149
ARM AND THERE'S ALSO A REMOTE

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:39.417
POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE

02:22:39.484 --> 02:22:40.952
PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

02:22:41.019 --> 02:22:44.155
DEAL WITH THIS WILL DECIDE NOT

02:22:44.222 --> 02:22:44.856
TO HARM.

02:22:44.923 --> 02:22:48.192
A OPPOSE SO I THINK IT'S DOABLE

02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:50.728
I'VE I'M NOT.

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:56.267
SO ON THAT FOR YOU COULD I AND I

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:58.269
DON'T WANT.

02:22:58.336 --> 02:22:59.704
TO NO BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A PRETTY

02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:01.940
GOOD AROUND ABOUT ON THE IN

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:02.840
PERSON I DON'T WANT TO CUT YOU

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:03.474
OFF FROM THE POINT YOU WANT TO

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:04.275
MAKE BUT I THINK IT IS SAFE TO

02:23:04.342 --> 02:23:05.810
SAY THAT. ONE OF THE COURT WAS

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:07.912
ASKED TO LOOK AT IT A REFUSE.

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:09.480
TO THIS -- STATEMENT THAT I READ

02:23:09.547 --> 02:23:11.015
FROM THE GOVERNOR STATE OF THE

02:23:11.082 --> 02:23:12.050
PRESIDENT PRO TEM AND ASSEMBLY

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:12.984
SPEAKER.

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.152
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT AS AN

02:23:14.218 --> 02:23:16.321
AREA WHERE WE WOULD BE FOCUSING

02:23:16.387 --> 02:23:18.656
ON IN THIS IMMEDIATE MOMENT OF

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:19.290
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH

02:23:19.357 --> 02:23:20.892
IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:22.660
URGENCY ISSUES OF STABILIZING

02:23:22.727 --> 02:23:23.728
UTILITIES.

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:25.196
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IF WE DON'T.

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:27.131
LOOK AT IT DOWN THE ROAD AND TRY

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:28.032
TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME

02:23:28.099 --> 02:23:28.599
GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND THE

02:23:28.666 --> 02:23:31.336
ISSUE -- BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE

02:23:31.402 --> 02:23:33.404
POINTS THAT I AM TAKING MY READ

02:23:33.471 --> 02:23:36.507
FROM AS I HEAR THEM SPEAK ABOUT.

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:37.909
THE LANES THAT WILL HAVE TO

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:39.544
OPERATE IN IT WILL HAVE SOME

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.145
MAJOR LISTING TO ADDRESS THE THE

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:44.015
CHALLENGES IN THOSE LANES -- AS

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:47.352
IT RELATES TO BRIDGE FINANCING --

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:48.686
PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD.

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:51.522
AND ALLOWING COST RECOVERY.

02:23:51.589 --> 02:23:53.024
THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT.

02:23:53.091 --> 02:23:55.793
A AND AND I JUST SAY THAT

02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:56.828
BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE SOME WORK

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:57.061
TO DO.

02:23:57.128 --> 02:23:58.496
THAT -- I'M NOT I'M NOT TRYING

02:23:58.563 --> 02:23:59.764
TO PRECLUDE AND THIS WAS AN

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:01.299
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET A

02:24:01.366 --> 02:24:03.067
PREVIEW AND I REALLY DO

02:24:03.134 --> 02:24:05.770
APPRECIATE COULD YOU GO TO SAID

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:06.371
NOW YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO WE

02:24:06.437 --> 02:24:07.505
HAVE [inaudible]

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:09.140
TO WELL [inaudible]

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:10.675
WELL.

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:12.210
NO YOU REALLY COULD.

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:14.245
BUT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:14.912
TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS AN OPTION

02:24:14.979 --> 02:24:16.614
THAT THAT YOU STILL HAVE ANOTHER

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:18.282
STEP TO YOUR PROCESS TO GO AND

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:20.418
WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL.

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:22.620
OF THAT -- SO.

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:24.355
CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE AND

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:25.523
DEBATE AROUND INVERSE IS

02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:28.326
CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE I JUST

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:30.194
WANT. TO GIVE THE MEMBER AN

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:31.829
OPPORTUNIST SORT OF GET -- TO

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:32.730
FINISHING HIS LINE OF

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:34.565
QUESTIONING ON IT.

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:37.101
BUT ALSO THEN BE ABLE -- TO TURN

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:38.469
TO THINK MISS BURKE WHO ALSO HAD

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.671
A QUESTION.

02:24:40.738 --> 02:24:42.540
OKAY -- AND THEN I REALLY WOULD

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:45.276
LIKE TO GET TO THE THE PUBLIC --

02:24:45.343 --> 02:24:46.277
TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:47.879
SORT OF SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND

02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:49.414
WHAT THEY'RE HEARING FOR ONE

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:50.381
MINUTE JUST ONE MORE QUESTION

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.649
SURE DEFINITELY.

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:52.850
YEAH NO I THOUGHT I THINK IT'S

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:54.285
AN INTERESTING LEGAL ANALYSIS

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:55.286
NOBODY'S EVER PERCENT OF THAT

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:57.989
BEFORE I THOUGHT THAT WAS.

02:24:58.056 --> 02:25:00.191
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE I

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:00.792
WOULD UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT

02:25:00.858 --> 02:25:01.959
YOU'RE SAYING.

02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:03.528
PUSHING BACK THE LITTLE BIT ON

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:04.529
EITHER THAT WOULD REALLY BE A

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:06.597
CURE ALL IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF

02:25:06.664 --> 02:25:07.899
YOU MOVE TO FALL BASED STANDARD.

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.333
AT LEAST WITH RESPECT THE P.

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:10.935
JEANNIE HISTORY.

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:12.937
ARE THERE STILL SOME MASSIVE

02:25:13.004 --> 02:25:15.573
WILDFIRE INDUCED LOSS.

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.241
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:18.776
AT FAULT.

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.311
FOR SO I DON'T.

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:21.779
NO IF IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO LIFT

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:24.215
THE HEAVIEST THING AROUND WE GOT

02:25:24.282 --> 02:25:26.784
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY --

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:29.687
A A WORTH PUTTING IN THAT EFFORT

02:25:29.754 --> 02:25:30.755
TO SECURE IS YOU'RE PROBABLY

02:25:30.822 --> 02:25:32.190
VERY WELL TAKEN YOU'RE

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:33.825
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE NO CURE

02:25:33.891 --> 02:25:36.961
ALLS THAT'S WHAT CARL SAID

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:39.497
ACCORDING EIGHTY APPROACH NEEDED.

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:41.566
IF AN NSA.

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:42.533
I THINK IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL FAR

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:43.234
REPORT.

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:43.701
TO TALK ABOUT INVERSE

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:45.103
CONDEMNATION BECAUSE THAT PUTS

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:46.938
INTO CONTEXT WHY ONE OF THE

02:25:47.004 --> 02:25:48.639
REASONS WHY THE UTILITIES IN

02:25:48.706 --> 02:25:50.074
CALIFORNIA IS VIEWED AS RISK

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:50.708
HERE.

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:52.643
AND WHY WE ARE SEEING INCREASED

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:54.846
COST AND RATING AGENCY INVESTOR

02:25:54.912 --> 02:25:57.548
CONCERNS -- WHICH I KNOW HAS

02:25:57.615 --> 02:25:59.784
BEEN A KEY CONSIDERATION AND

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:01.018
AFFECTS US WELL WHAT WE'RE

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.653
THINKING ABOUT COST RECOVERY IN

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.322
THE FIND AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.157
CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THAT TOPIC

02:26:06.224 --> 02:26:06.657
IN OUR DISCUSSION WHILE

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:08.793
RECOGNIZING.

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:11.662
THAT IS YOUR PREROGATIVE ABOUT

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:12.263
WHETHER TO PURSUE SOMETHING AT

02:26:12.330 --> 02:26:16.467
THIS TIME.

02:26:16.534 --> 02:26:18.369
OKAY -- IS BURKE.

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:19.770
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:26:19.837 --> 02:26:20.671
REPORT TO AND AND MY QUESTION IS

02:26:20.738 --> 02:26:22.340
MUCH LESS PROFOUND AND MOST OF

02:26:22.406 --> 02:26:24.008
THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN TODAY --

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:25.977
I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT

02:26:26.043 --> 02:26:26.978
IT'S A COORDINATED APPROACH AND

02:26:27.044 --> 02:26:28.579
I THINK SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION

02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:29.147
SOMETIMES YOU HEAR FROM OUR

02:26:29.213 --> 02:26:29.914
MEMBERS IS.

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.549
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO

02:26:31.616 --> 02:26:34.185
THIS UTILITY FINDING AND YOU

02:26:34.252 --> 02:26:36.053
KNOW WHO'S GONNA PAY AND AND I

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.855
THINK THAT THE REPAIRS ARE THE

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:39.423
TAXPAYERS WHOEVER.

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:41.058
YOU TALK ABOUT THEY HAVE CERTAIN

02:26:41.125 --> 02:26:42.460
EXPECTATIONS THEY HAD

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:43.494
EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY PAID

02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:45.129
THEIR RATES AND THAT THEY WOULD

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.531
HAVE THE SAFE UTILITY AND THAT.

02:26:46.597 --> 02:26:48.733
THEY PAID FOR IT ALREADY AND SO

02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:49.267
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A MORE

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:50.668
CORNING APPROACH I THINK IT'S

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:52.203
IMPORTANT -- OR IT WOULD BE

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:53.804
GREAT AS YOU GUYS CONTINUE TO

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:54.805
TALK.

02:26:54.872 --> 02:26:57.141
IS IS THAT YOU DISCUSS WHAT WHAT

02:26:57.208 --> 02:26:58.543
ELSE WERE REALLY PROVIDING THEM

02:26:58.609 --> 02:27:00.378
WHAT WHAT ELSE IF FOR ASKING

02:27:00.444 --> 02:27:01.913
THEM FOR MORE WHAT.

02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:03.247
IN ADDITION ARE WE GOING TO

02:27:03.314 --> 02:27:04.515
PROVIDE THEM WITH AND WHAT KIND

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:05.917
OF GUARANTEES ARE WE REALLY

02:27:05.983 --> 02:27:07.318
LOOKING AT PROVIDING THEM WITH.

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:08.619
BUT MY BIG MY ACTUAL REAL

02:27:08.686 --> 02:27:10.655
QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT INSURANCE

02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:11.856
IN GENERAL BECAUSE THEY THINK

02:27:11.923 --> 02:27:13.057
THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION TO

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:14.892
HAVE ABOUT FAIR PLAN AND WHETHER

02:27:14.959 --> 02:27:16.594
IT'S TIME FOR FAIR PLAN TO OF

02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:17.962
ALL OF OR THE HIGH RISK

02:27:18.029 --> 02:27:19.230
INSURANCE A MINUTE MARKET WHAT.

02:27:19.297 --> 02:27:20.998
DO WE DO ABOUT THAT BUT ACTUALLY

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.633
ABOUT I OWE YOU INSURANCE WOULD

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.769
YOU HAPPEN TO MENTION -- WHEN

02:27:24.835 --> 02:27:26.070
YOU HAVE LOOKED AT INSURANCE AND

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.872
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT I -- USE

02:27:27.939 --> 02:27:29.106
HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES AMPERE USE

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:30.341
GETTING INSURANCE BUT WHEN YOU

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:32.143
HAVE LOOKED AT THAT HAS THAT

02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:33.044
BEEN AT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR

02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.878
DEDUCTIBLE THAT THE

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:35.079
TRADITIONALLY PAY OR HAVE YOU

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:36.581
ACTUALLY LOOKED AT IF WE

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.149
INCREASE THEIR DEDUCTIBLE WHICH

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:39.317
BY THE WAY IS A SAVINGS TO

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:40.718
REPAIRS BECAUSE INSURANCE IS.

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:42.286
PASSED ON TO REPAIRS HAVE WE

02:27:42.353 --> 02:27:43.821
LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WITH WHAT

02:27:43.888 --> 02:27:45.423
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE -- IF WE

02:27:45.489 --> 02:27:46.490
INCREASE OUR DEDUCTIBLE AND AND

02:27:46.557 --> 02:27:48.192
IS IF IF THERE IS INSURANCE MORE

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:54.165
AVAILABLE AT THAT IN DOING THAT.

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:54.899
THAT'S A GREAT RECOMMENDATION

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:55.866
AND WE OFFER SOMETHING SIMILAR

02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:57.068
IN THE REPORT THAT YOU HAVE A

02:27:57.134 --> 02:27:59.537
HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE -- I DON'T

02:27:59.604 --> 02:28:00.972
RECALL WITH AXE THAT EXACT

02:28:01.038 --> 02:28:02.540
QUESTION BUT IN TERMS OF THE

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:04.342
TESTIMONY WE'VE GOTTEN FROM

02:28:04.408 --> 02:28:05.576
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:07.345
THEY SIMPLY SAY THERE IS NOT THE

02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:09.313
CAPACITY IN THE MARKET TO COVER

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.682
LIABILITIES THAT ARE TWENTY

02:28:11.749 --> 02:28:12.250
TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:28:12.316 --> 02:28:14.151
BECAUSE THE MOST A UTILITY CAN

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:15.820
GET RIGHT NOW IS ONE POINT FIVE

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:16.420
BILLION.

02:28:16.487 --> 02:28:18.189
AND SO I ASK THE QUESTION IS

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:19.824
THERE ENOUGH INSURANCE OUT THERE

02:28:19.890 --> 02:28:22.326
AND WHAT I'VE HEARD IS NO.

02:28:22.393 --> 02:28:24.328
WE'VE HEARD THAT IF THERE IS

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:27.131
SOME TYPE OF FUNDER SUPPORT FOR

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.734
LIABILITIES FROM TWO BILLION TO

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.868
TWENTY BILLION THEN THEIR

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:32.069
INSURANCE MARKETS THAT MY KICK

02:28:32.136 --> 02:28:33.738
IN FOR THE REAL REAL TALE RISK

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:35.806
OVER TWENTY BUT IT REALLY GETS

02:28:35.873 --> 02:28:37.875
BACK TO YOU IF IT IS A ONE A TWO

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:39.043
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUR SITUATION.

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:40.845
WHAT WE JUST EXPERIENCE THEN I

02:28:40.911 --> 02:28:41.979
THINK YOU HAVE INSURANCE BUT IF

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:43.447
IT'S SOMEONE IN TWENTY YEARS

02:28:43.514 --> 02:28:46.484
THEN THERE'S NOT THAT CAPACITY

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:48.486
AT THE MOMENT?

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.121
I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THE A

02:28:50.187 --> 02:28:52.023
MY UNDERSTAND FROM THE RECORD.

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:53.057
HAVE TEST ME THEY RECEIVED WAS

02:28:53.124 --> 02:28:54.592
THAT IT WASN'T THAT DEDUCTIBLE

02:28:54.659 --> 02:28:56.260
THAT WAS SORT OF THE DESIGN OF

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:56.927
THIS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

02:28:56.994 --> 02:28:58.496
AT CHAIRS AT THAT THAT WAS A

02:28:58.562 --> 02:28:59.263
GOOD DOCTOR WASN'T THE DECIDING

02:28:59.330 --> 02:28:59.664
FACTOR.

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.198
CAM AND IMPACTED THE ATTACHMENT

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:01.966
POINTS WEREN'T WEREN'T REALLY

02:29:02.033 --> 02:29:03.601
THE DECIDING FACTOR WAS.

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:05.603
THE OVERALL RISK PROFILE THAT

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:08.039
WAS DRIVING AND THE INABILITY TO

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:11.008
GET INSURANCE.

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:12.276
AND JUST -- ON THAT POINT.

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:12.810
THERE ARE OTHER FINANCING

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:13.911
MECHANISMS OF THAT WE TALKED

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:15.846
ABOUT THAT TYPICALLY ARE USED TO

02:29:15.913 --> 02:29:17.682
DEAL CATASTROPHE IS LIKE.

02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:18.849
A CAT CATASTROPHE BONDS FOR

02:29:18.916 --> 02:29:20.818
EXAMPLE BUT WHAT WE KEPT COMING

02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:22.219
BACK TO IS THAT ALL THOSE OTHER

02:29:22.286 --> 02:29:23.354
MECHANISMS OUT THERE ARE

02:29:23.421 --> 02:29:24.555
REASONABLE WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:25.523
LIABILITY OF A FEW HUNDRED

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:27.124
MILLION ONCE YOU'RE TALKING

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:28.526
ABOUT.

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:30.661
TENS AND TENS OF BILLIONS.

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:31.595
MANY OF THOSE MECHANISMS OF

02:29:31.662 --> 02:29:32.096
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.397
INVESTORS WHO WANNA WHO WANT TO

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:34.832
TAKE THAT ON IT SO THAT'S WHY

02:29:34.899 --> 02:29:36.467
THE MORE WE CAN REDUCE.

02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:38.369
THE OVERALL LIABILITY THEN THE

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:40.971
MORE MECHANISM THAT BECOME

02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:44.075
AVAILABLE TO US.

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:47.878
NOT -- TO COPY EVERYBODY ELSE

02:29:47.945 --> 02:29:49.914
BUT I THINK I MIGHT.

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:53.017
CAN HAS ONE MORE QUESTION OKAY --

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:53.784
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO

02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:55.619
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS THAT IF

02:29:55.686 --> 02:29:57.822
THERE WERE SOME FIND OR SOME

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.724
SORT OF BRIDGE LIABILITY FIND

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:00.991
WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE THEN

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:02.693
THAT INITIAL INSURANCE WOULD

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:04.695
BECOME MORE MORE AVAILABLE AND

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:06.564
THEN IN THAT CASE SO WOULD THERE

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:07.765
BE AN ISSUE IN RAISING.

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:10.434
THE DUCK DOUBLE FOR THE PURPOSE

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:11.602
OF MAYBE A VALUES FEEL PEOPLE

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:12.269
FEEL LIKE THEY MORE SKIN IN THE

02:30:12.336 --> 02:30:13.704
GAME TEN MILLION DOES NOT A LOT

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:15.539
OF SKIN IN THE GAME WHEN YOU'RE

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:16.073
LOOKING AT FIRE IS THAT.

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:18.042
EVEN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:21.245
MILLION WHICH IS LIKE ONE OF OUR

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:22.546
SMALLER ONES AT THIS POINT.

02:30:22.613 --> 02:30:23.481
IT SO I DON'T THINK THE CREATION

02:30:23.547 --> 02:30:24.815
OF A FUND MAKES INSURANCE MORE.

02:30:24.882 --> 02:30:26.650
AVAILABLE UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING

02:30:26.717 --> 02:30:27.885
TO GET PERHAPS INSURANCE AT A

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.520
HIGHER ATTACHMENT POINT BUT I

02:30:29.587 --> 02:30:30.921
THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

02:30:30.988 --> 02:30:32.523
WHAT YOU SAID WHICH IS WHAT WHAT

02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:33.891
DO REPAIRS GET OUT OF THIS MEAN

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:34.625
WHAT.

02:30:34.692 --> 02:30:36.293
AND ONE OF THE THINGS CAN BE

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:37.495
HAVE A HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE ONE I

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:38.295
HAVE TO BE I THINK WE

02:30:38.362 --> 02:30:39.663
RECOMMENDED A HUNDRED MILLION OR

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:40.831
EVEN A FEW HUNDRED MILLION I

02:30:40.898 --> 02:30:41.832
MEAN I THINK THAT SOMETHING

02:30:41.899 --> 02:30:42.967
WORTH KEEPING ON THE TABLE

02:30:43.033 --> 02:30:44.769
BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS AND

02:30:44.835 --> 02:30:46.003
THAT IS SOMETHING.

02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:47.037
AS YOU KNOW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

02:30:47.104 --> 02:30:48.739
GO TO RATES AND SO I THINK

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:51.776
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

02:30:51.842 --> 02:30:53.110
OKAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE US SOME

02:30:53.177 --> 02:30:55.045
TIME NOW TO TURN FOR PUBLIC

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:57.014
COMMENT -- WE'RE GOING TO

02:30:57.081 --> 02:31:00.484

RETURNED WE JUST MISTER WELL IF

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:14.832
YOU DON'T MIND THE THERE MAY BE

SOMETHING.

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.538
PLEASE FISHERMEN HOLDEN --

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:22.807
ASHES.

WE ARE REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:25.943
THE VICTIMS FROM THOMAS WOLSELEY

02:31:26.010 --> 02:31:27.945
NORTH BAY AND CAMP FIRE WE'RE

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:29.580
ALSO REPRESENTING THE FORTY ONE

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:30.614
LAW FIRMS.

02:31:30.681 --> 02:31:32.016
IF VICTIMS IS THE FOCUS AND

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:33.617
FRANKLY I'M NOT HEARING THAT

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:35.186
TODAY I'M LOOKING AT THE

02:31:35.252 --> 02:31:36.854

MILLION DOLLARS OF LIKE AND

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:49.366
HAVING A TEN DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE

02:31:49.433 --> 02:31:52.069
ON YOUR AUTO INSURANCE WE AGREE.

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:52.970
AND HAVE PUT THAT WE PUT A

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:54.472
SPECIFIC PROPOSAL OUT THERE ON

02:31:54.538 --> 02:31:56.006
THE FUND WE DON'T AGREE ON THE

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:57.842
SIZE WE THINK IT'S SMALLER WE

02:31:57.908 --> 02:31:59.410
AGREE NAY NEW COST RECOVERY

SAFETY WE AGREE WITH US TELL

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:07.985
WHEN WHAT.

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:10.187
THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP UP ALONG

02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:11.655
WITH THE AYE WHO'S AROUND SAFETY

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:13.023
AND MITIGATION WE HAVE SOME

02:32:13.090 --> 02:32:14.358
PROPOSALS AROUND THAT.

02:32:14.425 --> 02:32:16.093
WHAT'S MISSING IS ANYTHING

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.962
DEALING WITH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:32:18.028 --> 02:32:18.529
VICTIMS IS NOT PART OF THE

02:32:18.596 --> 02:32:19.497
REPORT.

02:32:19.563 --> 02:32:21.365
WE GET THE GOVERNOR THE SENATE

02:32:21.432 --> 02:32:23.534
PRO TEM THE INVERSE SHOULD NOT

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:25.936
BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE

02:32:26.003 --> 02:32:27.738
DISAGREE COMPLETELY.

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:28.906
N. VERSUS THIS WEED VENDORS

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:31.108
FIGHT LAST YEAR IT DOESN'T SAVE

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:33.310
YOU A DOLLAR IN THE FUTURE.

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:34.178
IT HELD A STATE BY GOING A

02:32:34.245 --> 02:32:36.247
QUICKER PROCESS TO GET THE

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:38.015
VICTIMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:38.816
IT IS COMPLETELY
