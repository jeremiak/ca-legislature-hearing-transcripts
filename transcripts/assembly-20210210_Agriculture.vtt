MANAGE PROGRAM WHICH AS WE KNOW

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:36.767
MATH IS A IT LOOKS POLLUTANT IS

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:40.604
A POWERFUL GREENHOUSE GAS. AND

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:44.408
WITH AS A STAY THAT'S ONE STATE

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:51.515
NATH NOSES VERY WELL- WITH.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:56.120
DIGESTIVE PROGRAM DEPLOYS THE

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.189
TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE THE

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.224
METHANE WHICH BECOMES A

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:02.393

LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.634
CURRENTLY WE HAVE A HUNDRED IN

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.269
NINETEEN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:16.106

FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. IT'S

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.582
ALLOCATED ALMOST TWO HUNDRED

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.617
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE TYPES

FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.460
BILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:41.732
FUNDS- I WOULD SAY IT'S. VERY

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:42.333
VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THE

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:43.334
ALTERNATE THE NORMALISED

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.537
PROGRAM REALLY DEALS FOR SMALL

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:48.939
AND MID SIZED FAMILIES AND

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:51.208
THEIR HERDS. HOW TO BETTER

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:54.245
MANAGE DRIVING OR WE'VE GOT A

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.646
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN OF THOSE

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.114
PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.449
AND TOGETHER WITH THE DERRY

00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:00.484
DIGESTIVE PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.419
ABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.889
BY TWO POINT THREE MILLION

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:07.558
METRIC TONS PER YEAR THAT'S A

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.860
PRETTY REMARKABLE AND WHAT THE

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.395
L. A. L. LET'S REFER TO AS A

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.464
VERY EFFICIENT INVESTMENT OF

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.332
CLIMATE CHANGE DOLLARS. THAT'S

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:17.234
THE EQUIVALENT OF REMOVING HALF

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.903
A MILLION CARS FROM OUR ROADS

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:21.005
SO IT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:21.805
AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.908
CONTINUING THAT PROGRAM WHICH

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.443
HAS TWO VERY IMPORTANT ADDED

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.179
BENEFITS ONE IS RENEWABLE

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:31.649
ENERGY SOURCE AND TWO IS THE

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:34.385
PROVEN REDUCTION ODORS. FROM

00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:36.654
FROM JERRY SO IT'S BEEN VERY

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.989
VERY POPULAR IN THE COMMUNITY

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.625
LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST IS

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.760
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMS IS

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.762
ARE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:46.730
HAS BOTH AND INCENTIVES FOR

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:51.535
FARMERS. AS WELL. AS A

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.305
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. IS I'M

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:55.706
IN THE FINANCIAL FOR THAT WILL

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.875
WELL PARTNER WITH OUR GROWERS

00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.109
AND WITH OUR RANCHERS TO

IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.646
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AGAIN THAT

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.448
ARE BASED ON AN R. C. ASK

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.849
SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:08.185
ARE PROVEN TO WORK WELL FOR THE

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.487
FARMER AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:12.289
THEY APPROVE STYLE HEALTH THE

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:14.692
SEQUESTER CARBON AND THEY

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.260
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.795
THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:20.731
DESIGNED TO SHOWCASE FOR ALL SO

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.533
THAT GROUPS OF FARMERS WHO ARE

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:24.702
NOT YET READY TO GO DOWN THAT

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:27.371
PATHWAY CAN VISIT THOSE SITES

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.106
LEARN FROM THE SITE IN A NUMBER

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:30.674
OF THEM ARE COLLECTING THE DATA

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.209
WHICH WILL HELP US. UNDERSTAND

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.078
WHAT WE CAN DO TO DANCE EVEN

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.580
MORE OF THESE TYPES ACTRESS WE

TIME YOU WE WERE NOT ALLOWED

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:02.586
TO- SWITCH ENGINE TYPE SO WE

THAT IS GOING. IT IS PROBABLY

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.646
OF ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT ONE

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.348
IS THE MOST POPULAR ONE AND

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:33.783

KNOW HOW MANY OTHER STATES HAVE

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:48.685
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR. SO

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:51.855
OKLAHOMA AT ONE POINT- INVESTED

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.456
AND HEALTHY SOURCE PRACTICES

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.358
AND THE STATE OF IOWA HAS

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:58.762
INVESTED AND COVER CROPPING TO

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:03.800
PROBLEM. BUT NO OTHER STATE HAS

CALIFORNIA HAS MADE. OR WITH

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.809
THE QUANTIFICATION OF

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.445
REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S WHY I WAS

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.280
VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK

IT AND. ASSIGN YEARS. I

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.242
PRACTICE TO GO WITH. SO IT'S A

MANY REASONS. AND AND I KNOW

MISSED A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING-

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:53.910

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:05.221
QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER

WOULD. GOOD TO SEE SECRETARY

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:10.260
ROSS FIRST TIME ON THIS

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:12.228
COMMITTEE AND SO I'M SITTING

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.063
HERE NOODLING A LITTLE BIT

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.266
ABOUT A POTENTIAL QUESTIONS SO-

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:20.270
HE- I THINK ABOUT MY DISTRICT-

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:22.071
IN PARTICULAR WITH RELATION TO

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:24.140
FIRES AND ALL THE GREENHOUSE

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:27.210
GASES THAT WE- IN YOUR WE TALK

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.945
A LOT ABOUT HEALTHY SOILS AND

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.814
THINGS LIKE THAT. ARE THERE ARE

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.749
ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WOULD

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:36.085
BE HELPFUL FOR FARMERS RANCHERS

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:38.955
AND GRAZING- GRANTS BECAUSE WE

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:40.323
CAN IF WE CAN GRACE SOME OF

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:44.994
THESE AREAS THAT ARE OVER-GROUND POSSIBLY. WE CAN REDUCE

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.429
THE IMPACTS OF FIRE AND PROTECT

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:47.664
THE ENVIRONMENT AND I USE AN

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.867
EXAMPLE OF THE POPLIN FIELD

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.036
STATION WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:55.805
SO. VERY STARK CONTRAST A

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:56.739
COUPLE FIRES A COUPLE YEARS

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:59.142
AGO. WHERE YOU HAD AN AREA THAT

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.543
WAS GRAZED NEXT TO AN AREA THAT

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.078
WASN'T CRAZY IN A FIRE WENT

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.746
THROUGH IN TWO THOUSAND

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:04.347
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THAT THE

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:05.381
TIME THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.784
HISTORY OF THE STATE. IT WAS IT

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.519
WAS A IT WAS THERE A YEAR LATER

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:12.422
THE STARK. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.424
THE TWO PIECES OF PROPERTY. ONE

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.259
WAS ONE ONE WAS ALREADY

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:18.228
RECOVERING AND THE OTHER PART

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.763
MAY NEVER RECOVER SO AS WE ARE

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.233
LOOKING AT INITIATIVES THAT

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.501
WILL HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.904
GASES- SOME OF THAT. I HOPE CAN

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.106
BE LANDSCAPE RELATED FOR FIRE

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:33.543
PREVENTION BECAUSE- THE STORY I

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.711
READ SAID THAT HALF OF THE

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:37.046
POLLUTION. THAT WAS LIBERATED

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:38.548
LAST YEAR CAME FROM FOREST

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:41.150
FIRES SO JUST IT'S JUST MORE OF

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.752
A COMMENTARY I THINK YOU'RE

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:45.255
WELL AWARE OF THIS- BUT- BUT-

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.257
YEAH. NOT SURE I'M NOT EVEN

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:49.425
SURE WHERE THIS FALLS IN QUITE

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.828
FRANKLY. BUT IT'S A REALLY

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:53.029
IMPORTANT POINT IS SOMETHING

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.931
THAT I JUST SPOKE AT OUTLOOK

00:58:54.998 --> 00:59:00.536
pWILDFIRES AND- IMPACTS TO

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.906
AGRICULTURE. AND SO I THINK

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.642
THIS WE ALREADY FUND PRESCRIBED

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.477
ROTATIONAL GRAZING PRACTICES AS

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.545
PART OF HEALTHY STYLE WE FUND

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:11.314
APPLICATION OF COMPOST AND

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.049
RANGE THAT FOR HEALTHY SOIL.

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:15.585
AND IT'S REALLY WORKING WITH

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:17.287
THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH MY

00:59:17.353 --> 00:59:19.122
COLLEAGUES OF RESOURCES AGENCY

00:59:19.188 --> 00:59:21.391
AS WE DO ALL THE- WE CAN. FOR

00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:23.326
WILDFIRE RESILIENCE

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.261
UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:27.030
AGRICULTURE AND BAD CLEARLY.

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:29.132
ROTATIONAL GRAZING AND ALLOWING

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:31.167
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ONE

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.836
CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT PICTURE

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.104
AS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE UP A

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:36.539

NO TELLING OCCURS WE DON'T

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.567
DISTURB THE SOIL MOST TREES

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.770
REMAIN IN THE GROUND FOR UP TO

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:23.239
FIFTY YEARS MORE. THE TREES IN

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.540
MY GROUP HAD OUTLIVED THE

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.208
PREVIOUS OWNER AND I EXPECT THE

TREES THAT I PLANTED TO OUTLIVE

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.713
ME. AND AVOCADO GROVE CREATES

NATURAL LEAF LITTER WHICH

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.417
DECOMPOSE INTO THE SOIL HELPING

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.618
TO REGENERATE INTO HEALTHY

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.753
SOILS THAT SEQUESTER CARBON

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.261
EVERY FOOTSTEP ARE HUNDREDS OF

HEALTHIER OUR STATE WILL BE A

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.645
SPONGE FOR WATER AND CARBON. I

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.547
BEGAN FARMING AVOCADOS AS A

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.615
HOBBY INTEREST IN THE EARLY TWO

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.350
THOUSANDS AND IT BECAME A

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.718
BUSINESS FOR ME IN TWENTY

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.854

BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO REALLY

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.193
COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.527
FOUND IT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.896
MAKE A PROFIT JUST ON AVOCADOS

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:23.899
ALONE- BECAUSE AS I SAID WE'RE

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.601
LUCKY IF WE CAN BREAK EVEN. SO

01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:27.470
I BEGAN TO PLANT OTHER CROPS

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:29.738
DIVERSE TO FIVE MY LANDSCAPE.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.207
ARE ADDING COFFEE BETWEEN MY

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:34.944
ROSE- AND BANANAS EVEN HOW TO

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.979
LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE-

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:40.449
AGAIN CORREGGIO TREES AND

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:41.250
HARDLY DISTURBING THE SOIL.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:42.017

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:48.157
DAUNTING IT REALLY IS IT'S

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:50.259
TOUGH IN GETTING GOVERNOR

SCALE OF THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.583
OUR STATE IS FACING CALIFORNIA

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.285
ALSO NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE AND

WELL FUNDED CLIMATE RESILIENCE

CALIFORNIA AVOCADO GROWERS ARE

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.339
ALREADY PART OF BUILDING

RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:39.842
AND IT IS IMPORTANT WE FIND A

EXISTING CONTRIBUTIONS. IN

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.384
CONCLUSION. AVOCADO TREES IN

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.919
CALIFORNIA CHECK THE

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:51.820

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.491
COMMUNITIES SCIENTIFIC DATA

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:56.592
SHOWS THAT AVOCADO TREES

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:57.760
CAPTURE CARBON AND YET

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.228
CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:00.696
RULES DO NOT FINANCIALLY

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.499
RECOGNIZE THIS BENEFIT WHICH IS

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:03.966
OFFERED TO MANY OTHER

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.502

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:07.970
SUCH SUPPORT WHEN COMBINED WITH

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.939
INCREASING AVOCADO IMPORTS AND

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.041
SKYROCKETING PRODUCTION COSTS

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.742
IS CREATING AN UNMANAGEABLE

FINANCIAL SQUEEZE FOR AVOCADO

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.846

URBANIZATION. ESPECIALLY RIGHT

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.518
HERE IN MY HEART. FOR THOSE AN

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.155
GOALS. THREE YEARS AGO THE

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.757
ALMOND BOARD MEMBERS AND SENIOR

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:44.326
STAFF MATT KERR ABOUT A NEW

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.528
PATH FOR THE ALMOND INDUSTRY.

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.330
ONE THAT RECOGNIZE OUR CHANGING

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.733
CLIMATE AND OUR CHANGING WORLD.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.434
ONE THAT KEPT US TWO STEPS

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.035
AHEAD INSTEAD OF PLAYING CATCH

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.637
UP. WE WANTED TO BE PART OF THE

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:58.574
SOLUTION. THE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.175
THAT MEETING RESULTED IN FOUR

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:04.179
GOALS. RIGHT THERE. REDUCING

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.781
THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO GROW

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.816
POUND OF ALMONDS BY 20%

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.151
INCREASE IN THE ADOPTION OF

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.120
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:13.822
MANAGEMENT BY 25% REDUCING OUR

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.991
DUST AT HARVEST BY 50% AND

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.860
BECOMING A ZERO WASTE INDUSTRY

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.061
WITH NOT ONLY THE WHOLE AND

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.130
SHALL. BECOME A VALUABLE CO

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.765
PRODUCTS BUT WITH THE WOODY

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.533
BIOMASS FROM THE TREES BEING

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.038
UTILIZED. I WILL START. YOU

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.708
HAVE THE WRONG SLIDES M. GO

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.977
AHEAD DOESN'T GO ONE MORE AHEAD.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:39.081
THERE YOU GO. I WILL START WITH

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:42.050
ZERO WASTE HISTORICALLY THE

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:44.119
WOODY BIOMASS FROM THE ORCHARD

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.088
REMOVAL WAS BURNED AND THEN

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.323
CAME CO GENERATION PLANTS

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.592
OFFERING ONE OPTION TO WHICH-

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:51.260
TO UTILIZE THE SHREDDED

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.061
ORCHARDS. FARMERS COULD

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:54.096
MITIGATE THE COST OF THE

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.063
ORCHARD REMOVAL WITH THE

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.199
REVENUE IT GENERATED BUT WE

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.034
KNOW CO GENERATION IS BEING

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:04.640
PHASED OUT. NOW AFTER YEARS OF

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.275
ALMOND BOARD FUNDED RESEARCH WE

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.777
ARE RECYCLING WHOLE ORCHARDS

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.312
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NOT

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:12.681
ONLY IS CARBON SEQUESTERED BUT

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.116
THE WATER HOLDING CAPACITY OF

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.318
THE SOIL IS INCREASED BY UP

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:20.522
220% FOR GROWER LIKE ME THAT IS

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.524
NOT JUST A SELLING POINT.

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.993
THAT'S A NO BRAINER. A GAME

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.929
CHANGER SPECIALLY AND WATER

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:31.834
CHALLENGED AREAS. TWO YEARS AGO

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.569
WE CHIPPED IN INCORPORATED THE

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.871
FIRST TO TWENTY ACRES AND WE'LL

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:36.905
DO ANOTHER NINETY TWO ACRES

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.774
THIS FALL AT THE ONSET OF OUR

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.742
FIRST PROJECT GRANTS DID NOT

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:43.145
EXIST. BUT DID BECOME AVAILABLE

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.379
THROUGH HEALTHY SOILS IN THE

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.515
AIR RESOURCES BOARD A WEEK

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.450
AFTER WE SPREAD OUR LAST CHIP

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.885
SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE I HAVE MY

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.987
APPLICATION AND FOR THE NEXT

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.856
NINETY TWO ACRES. IT IS

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:54.990
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:56.959
TRANSFORMATIVE UNDERTAKING IS

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:58.994
COSTLY. WITH EXPENSIVE

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.396
EQUIPMENT THAT GROWERS WOULD OR

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:04.967
COULD NEVER OUT. DOING THE

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.369
RIGHT THING IS NEVER CHEAP. THE

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:08.737
FINANCIAL BENEFITS ARE NOT

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:09.972
IMMEDIATE AND ARE SPECIALLY

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.540
HARD FOR SMALL GROWERS WHO DO

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.141
NOT BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIES

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:18.213
OF SCALE. THE ALMOND INDUSTRY

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.715
HAS ALREADY BEEN REDUCING ITS

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.216
WATER USE PER POUND OF NUTS

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.452
OVER THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.020
YEARS AS A MAJORITY OF FARMERS

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.822
TO SWITCH FROM FLOOD TO MY

CHRIS WRANGLER DRIP OR

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.093
SUBSURFACE IRRIGATION. NOW

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.194
THERE ARE FARMERS WHO HAVE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:33.829
NEVER EVEN FLOODED THEIR

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:36.164
ORCHARDS PRECISION IRRIGATION

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.766
USING TREE BIOLOGY COMPUTER

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.234
TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCED

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.670
EQUIPMENT. COMBINED WITH

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.571
INCREASED WATER HOLDING

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.007
CAPACITY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.542
FOR WATER SAVINGS WERE WE

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:48.143
DIDN'T THINK WE COULD SQUEEZE

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:54.750
OUT ANYMORE. OVER THE LAST

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.084
TWENTY YEARS OUR FIRM HAS USE

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:58.253
NRCS GRANTS TO CHANGE FROM

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.255
FLOOD TO MIKE REYES WRANGLERS

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:01.757
BUT NOW WE ARE TURNING TO SWEEP

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.091
PROGRAM TO HELP US IMPROVE

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:06.328
FURTHER. HAVING A COST SHARE

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.596
HAS ALLOWED US TO PUT IN AN

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:11.400
EFFICIENT. I'M SORRY THIS TURN

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:14.770
IN THE WRONGFUL. YOU GUYS OF

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.104
THE RUGS LAID FLAT WELL TO STOP

THEIR. HAVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.110
THE LOUDEST TO PUT IN AN

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.047
SYSTEM WE MIGHT OPPOSE BOEHNER

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:27.049
FOR GOD. IT MAKES THE

FERMENTABLE DOABLE WITHOUT

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.019

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.188
INTO SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.357
STATIONS FROM WHICH WHICH

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.526
INFORM OUR DECISIONS. ON OUR

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:39.127
WEBSITE ORCHARD WE HAVE TAKEN

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:41.163
WATER SAVING TO A WHOLE NEW

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:42.764
LEVEL OUT OF NECESSITY FROM

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.700
HAVING SEEN ZERO WATER

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.635
ALLOTMENTS ALL TOO FREQUENTLY.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:49.071
OUR INDUSTRY HAS LEARNED MUCH

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.605
FROM THE DROUGHT AND THAT

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.975
THREAT ALWAYS LOOMS LARGE

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.676
SPECIFICALLY ON OUR SITE WE

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.078
HAVE LEARNED THREE STUDIES

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.813
FUNDED BY THE ALMOND BOARD AND

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:58.714
WORKING DIRECTLY WITH

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.515
RESEARCHERS TO USE SOIL

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.417
MOISTURE MONITORING TO DELAY

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.619
THE ONSET OF IRRIGATION. TO USE

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:05.754
DEFICIT YOU'RE A NATION

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:06.955
STRATEGIES AND EVAPORATE

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:09.524
TRANSPIRATION RATES TO

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.192
STRATEGICALLY SCHEDULE

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.027
IRRIGATION. THE RECENTLY

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:16.732
pBLOCK UTILIZED HERE BUT NOT

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:21.770
HERE. KIND OF- HAS A FOUR FOOT

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.873
RADIUS WHICH WILL LATER EXPAND

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.842
TO EIGHT FEET AND THIS ALLOWS

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:28.477
US TO REDUCE OUR WATER USED BY

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.846
ALMOST 50% AND DISCOURAGE WEED

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:33.648
GROWTH SIMPLY PUT NO WATER NO

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:38.487
WEEKS. DON'T CHANGE THIS LIFE

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:41.289
HERE TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:44.326
SAME ORCHARD YOU CAN SEE OR NOT

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:46.461
HOW EVENLY THE TREES HAVE GROWN

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.763
WITH TARGETED FERTILIZER

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:50.065
APPLICATION AND NO COMPETITION

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.600
FROM WEEDS WE'LL SEE THOSE

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.802
PICTURES IN A BET. THE CENTERS

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.037
OF THE ROSE REPRESENTING TWO

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.505
THIRDS OF THE ACREAGE TO THIS

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.473
DAY HAVE NEVER BEEN SPRAYED

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:01.276
WITH HERBICIDE. AND THAT GETS

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:01.843
ME TO OUR THIRD GOAL YOU CAN

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:04.880
STAY HERE. ADOPTION IN THE

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.281
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:09.317
MANAGEMENT NO THE SYNERGIES

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:11.053
BETWEEN OUR ZERO WASTE WATER

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.255
AND PEST MANAGEMENT GOALS OVER

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:15.123
THE YEARS GROWERS PESTICIDE USE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.325
HAS TRENDED DOWN. AND OUR

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:18.827
TECHNOLOGY AND MONITORING HAS

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.629
ALLOWED FOR PRECISION

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:21.396
APPLICATION AND TARGETING OF

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.498
PESTS ALMOND BOARD FUNDED

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:25.267
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DORMANT

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.369
SPRAYS COULD BE ELIMINATED PAST

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.670
MONITORING HELPED US TO MORE

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:33.008
EFFECTIVELY TIME OR ELIMINATE

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:33.575
SOME OF OUR CROP PROTECTION

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:36.378
MATERIALS. AND HERE WE'RE ON

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.580
THE RIGHT SIDE MORE RECENTLY WE

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.415
HAVE BEEN EXPLORING COVER CROPS

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.716
IN OUR ORCHARDS AND LOOKING AT

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.618
THEIR BENEFITS TO NOT JUST

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:44.586
HONEY BEES AND NATIVE

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.555
POLLINATORS BUT TO BENEFICIAL

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.590
INSECTS TO CONTROL PESTS I

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.125
CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.527
BENEFITS. OF COVER CROPS AND

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.262
THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:56.098
PROMOTES AND FINANCIALLY

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.767
SUPPORTS THEIR USE. GRANTS HELP

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.202
TO INCREASE THIS PRACTICES

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.903
REACH ESPECIALLY WITH SMALLER

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.706
GROWERS. ON OUR FARM I HAVE

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:07.042
PERSONALLY OBSERVED HERBICIDE

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.311
RESISTANT WEEDS OUT COMPETED.

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:11.346
INCREASES A BENEFICIAL INSECTS

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.648
INSECT POPULATIONS AND I'VE

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.350
SEEN MY BEEKEEPERS COLONIES

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.552
FLOURISHING BEFORE DURING AND

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.621
AFTER THE ALMOND BLOOM. I

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:20.889
HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED ON THE

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.724
SOIL HEALTH BENEFITS SUCH AS

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.227
ADDING ORGANIC MATTER AND

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.262
NITROGEN FIXATION. LOOK AT

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:31.900
THESE PICTURES. THIS IS HABITAT

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.703
THESE ARE ECOSYSTEMS. WE CUT

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:37.005
OUR INSECTICIDE USED BY TWO

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:39.774
THIRDS AND STILL TURNED IN TOP

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:42.010
QUALITY NUTS BUT THIS IS NOT

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.545
WHERE WE ARE STOPPING WE ARE

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.080
COTINUING WITH PROVEN CULTURAL

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.448
PRACTICES LIKE ORCHARD

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.583
SANITATION. WHILE ALSO

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.018
EXPLORING STERILE INSECT

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:52.187
TECHNOLOGY TO PREVENT AND MEET

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.756
PASS PROBLEMS HEAD ON. RECALL

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.825
HELLO YOU CAN'T RECALL IT

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:57.859
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:59.895
BUT RECALL THE PITCHER OF THE

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.630
YOUNG TREES WITH NO WEEDS IN

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.764
THE MIDDLE DURING THE SUMMER

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.966
THAT LOOKS SO BARE. THE LOWER

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.768
SET OF PICTURES IS THAT SAME

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.436
BLOCK FROM EARLIER IN THE

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:10.071
SPRING WHICH WE UTILIZE WINTER

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.007
RAINS TO GROW COVER CROPS THEN

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.643
TILL NTO THE SOIL JUST THE TOP

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.811
THREE INCHES UP.THE PEAS AND

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.346
CHEST TIED MUSTARD RECOVERED IN

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:19.714
LADY BAGS OF NATIVE

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.683
POLLINATORS. AND PAULINE IN

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.718
CARBON FROM THE AIR THE WHOLE

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:30.292
TIME AS THEY GROW. SLIDE. OKAY

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.326
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:34.829
BEFORE GO AHEAD AND. THERE IS

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:35.964
THAT BLOOD BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.365
HAVE WEEDS ON IT THAT WAS THE

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.201
SAME WHEN YOU SAW BEFORE. AND

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:43.071
ONE MORE. AND THERE IT IS TWO

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.173
MONTHS LATER STILL NO WEEDS

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.175
STILL NO HERBICIDE USED IN THE

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:49.110
CENTERS AND GROWING EVENLY AND

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.213
BEAUTIFULLY WITH TARGETED

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:54.516
FERTILIZER APPLICATION. OKAY GO

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:58.486
AHEAD. AND NOW WE COME TO OUR

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.121
LAST GOAL OF DUST REDUCTION

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.157
WHICH HAS PERHAPS BEEN THE MOST

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.358
DIFFICULT AND I WILL TELL YOU

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.360
WHY IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:06.895
COLLABORATION ON A MASSIVE

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.196
SCALE BECAUSE IT WILL INVOLVE

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.731
CHANGING HOW WE DO THINGS FROM

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.967
BEGINNING TO END. IT WILL NOT

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.535
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT WILL BE

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.804
EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE TO

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.272
HARVEST OFF GROUND ORCHARDS

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:18.640
WILL HAVE TO BE MANAGED

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.741
DIFFERENTLY TO ACCOMMODATE NEW

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:22.344
EQUIPMENT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.346
PROCESS THESE FOR DRYING THAT'S

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:25.447
WILL HAVE TO BE ENGINEERED AND

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.449
IMPLEMENTED ALL WILL STILL

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:28.717
TRYING TO GET EVERY NOT OUT OF

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:30.585
THE ORCHARD TO MAINTAIN ZERO

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.321
WASTE AND REDUCE PEST HABITAT.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.689
THERE ALSO REMAIN THE QUESTION

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.891
OF HOW FARMERS AND HAULERS WILL

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.627
OF FOR THE TRANSITION THE

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:39.861
THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.463
UNDERSTAND THE BIGGEST MAYBE

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:44.699
HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO MAKE

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:45.267
THESE CHANGES AND THE RIPPLE

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.168
EFFECTS. FOR NOW MY BROTHER AND

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.670
I FOLLOW BEST MANAGEMENT

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.972
PRACTICES CAREFULLY WATCHING

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.141
HOW WE MANAGE THE ORCHARD FLOOR.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.609
I JUST OUR EQUIPMENT AND MAKE

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.910
OUR PASSES WE ALSO WILL

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:59.447
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN UPGRADING

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.650
THE DUST. BUT FULHAM

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.752
REPLACEMENT ISN'T ALWAYS

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:04.919
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT CAN BE THE

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:08.723
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US GETTING-PAID FOR A YEAR'S WORTH OF WORK

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.625
AND NOT GETTING PAID AT ALL.

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:11.760
COST SHARE GRANTS FOR NEW

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:13.695
EQUIPMENT FOR RETROFITS CAN

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.464
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:19.134
OPERATIONS OF ALL SIZES. WE

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.336
WILL REDUCE OUR DUST BUT WE

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:24.239
NIGHT WE MIGHT NOT QUITE REACH

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.741
50% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.842
GOALS ARE MEANT TO BE HARD TO

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:30.378
REACH IF THEY WORK HARD THEY

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.580
WOULDN'T QUALIFY AS A GOAL. BUT

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.049
JUST IN SETTING THEM WE

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:40.155
INITIATE CHANGE. RIGHT. AND I

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.956
WANT TO CLOSE WITH A FEW THINGS

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.658
ILLUSTRATING HOW ARE GOALS

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:46.061
EMPHASIZE THAT SUSTAINABILITY

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.163
IS A JOURNEY NOT A DESTINATION

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:49.531
I ALSO PITCHER THE ALMOND

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.666
INDUSTRY AS A FOOD WEB WE ARE

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.468
DEEPLY INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.836
COMMUNITIES WHICH INCLUDE OUR

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.971
LABOR FORCE THE HOLLERS AND THE

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:59.574
PROCESSORS THE UNIVERSITIES

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.710
WHERE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED THE

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.611
BUSINESS AN ENGINE ENGINEERS

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.447
THAT DEVELOP OUR EQUIPMENT THE

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:06.381
COMPANIES THEY GIVE US CROP

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.116
PROTECTION AND THE TECH

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.784
INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES.

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:12.654
INNOVATION AND IF ANY FOOD WEB

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.622
WHEN ONE PART BECOMES WEAK THE

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.691
OTHERS SUFFER AS WELL.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:19.327
IMBALANCE LEADS TO DYSFUNCTION

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:20.662
SO WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.131
OF EVERY PART OF OUR WEB BEING

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.333
SUPPORTED IN REMAINING HEALTHY.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.701
ANOTHER THING TO UNDERSTAND IS

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.436
THAT EVERY PRACTICE DOES NOT

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.405
WORK FOR EVERY OPERATION

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:32.107
EVERYONE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.309
UNIQUE COMBINATION OF WHAT GETS

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.944
THEM CLOSER TO THE TWENTY

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.278
TWENTY FIVE GOALS. WHICH WE

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.913
MONITOR MONITOR IN OUR

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.049
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM. IT IS

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.751
ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.786
THERE ARE TRADE OFFS WERE MADE

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.154
SHOES AND ULTRA EFFICIENT

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:47.689
IRRIGATION SYSTEM THAT SAVES

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.057
WATER ND REDUCES HERBICIDE

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.825
USE. BUT ALSO REDUCES THE

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:53.328
BILITY TO HAVE A CROP COVER

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.330
CROP OUTSIDE OF THE RAINY

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.499
SEASON. IF WE HAVE WHAT.

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:58.967
ANOTHER MERMAID SHOES COVER

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.369
CROPS KNOWING EXTRA TRACTOR

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:01.903
HOURS WILL BE REQUIRED TO

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.372
MANAGE IT. THESE ARE EXAMPLES

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.707
OF THE DECISIONS WE MAKE EVERY

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.009
SINGLE DAY SMALL FARMS FACE

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:09.277
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAN

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:11.246
LARGER ONES. BUT WE ARE ALL

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:14.215
CHALLENGED. ONE THING WE DO

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.717
HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT EVERY

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:16.818
SINGLE ALMOND FARMER IN

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.386
CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:19.587
FINANCIALLY THROUGH THEIR CROP

01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:22.157
ASSESSMENT IN THE RESEARCH IN

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:22.757
THE WORK BEING DONE TO CREATE

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.660
CHANGE. OUR INVESTMENT DOES NOT

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.595
STOP IT RESEARCH THAT CONTINUES

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:29.297
ON TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:31.466
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WHICH ARE

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:32.901
THEN BROUGHT TO GROWERS AND PUT

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:35.236
TO USE WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.071
THE FUTURE. AND THAT IS THAT'S

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:40.442
THE ALMOND INDUSTRY AND NHL

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:44.245
THANK YOU. PUN INTENDED. THE

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.014
CHRISTINE REALLY APPRECIATE-

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.949
YOUR PRESENTATION- AND I'M SURE

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.184
THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.820
OKAY I DO I STAY HERE GO BACK

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:52.420
THERE- IF YOU GO BACK IT WOULD

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:57.492
BE. YEAH YOU KNOW. NO PROBABLY

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.394
NOT YEAH SO IF YOU GO BACK-

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.262
THAT WOULD BE GREAT SIX BUTTONS

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:06.167
THAT WILL GET MY DOG UP HERE.

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.204
SO OUR FINAL- SPEAKER AND

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:12.073
PRESENTER- ON THIS PANEL IS

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.375
CINEMA COUNTY DAIRY OPERATOR

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:18.313
DIED BERETTA- WHO IS ALSO HERE

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:18.880
WITH US IN THE HEARING ROOM

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.849
MISTER BERBER RED AND HIS

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.951

APARTMENT- AND- CDFW NOW IS A

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.500
DISINCENTIVE FOR SCHWAB SO- I

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.802
GUESS THAT WE NOT THREE- CAL'S

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.804
IN- TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE'VE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.940
MADE THE TRANSITION TO ORGANIC-

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.108
WE WERE CONVENTIONAL DAIRY. UP

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.311
UNTIL THEN AND JUST IN OUR AREA

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.912
WITH THE PASSION THAT WE HAVE

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.514
AND MOST OF THE DAIRIES IN OUR

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:02.383
AREA ABOUT 90% OF OUR ORGANIC.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.319
WE HAVE A TEN TO GROW PASTURE

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.154
WHERE THE DAIRIES. IN THE

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.222
CENTRAL VALLEY AS MISTER MATHIS

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:11.192
pABILITY TO GROW MORE OF THEIR

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.494
OWN FEED AND HAY AND THINGS

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:14.195
LIKE THAT BUT WE'RE ALL THE

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.864
SAME. DAIRY INDUSTRY I THINK

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.933
THAT'S ONE THING THAT. TOO MANY

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.735
PEOPLE TRY TO SEPARATE THE

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.804
ORGANIC IN THE CONVENTIONAL AND

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:23.738
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.607
CANNOT DO. IN THE DAIRY

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.275
INDUSTRY WE'RE ALL MEANT TO

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:30.144
PRODUCE. THE BEST QUALITY MILK

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:32.513
THAT WE CAN'T IS DEFEATED- FEET

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.918
ARE. OUR PEOPLE- SO AGAIN AND-

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:38.353
SIX WE WENT AHEAD AND

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.688
TRANSITION TO ORGANIC- I AM

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.824
THIRD GENERATION I HAVE TO MY

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:45.426
CHILDREN- MY OLDEST DAUGHTER MY

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:46.527
YOUNGEST SON ON THE FARM WITH

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:47.996
ME AND I ALSO AVE A NINE YEAR

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:50.231
OLD GRANDSON. THAT IS FALLING

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.966
HE'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN THAT

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:53.368
THE TWO OLDER KIDS RELEASE T.

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:56.037
HE COMES TO WORK EVERY DAY- BUT

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:56.971
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:58.940
THAT. THAT WE'VE DONE IT

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:01.342
BREADED JERRY OVER THE YEARS-

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.610
MY GRANDFATHER WAS VERY

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:05.480
INNOVATIVE AND IN IN THE- LATE

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:08.082
MIDDLE SIXTIES. DECIDED THAT HE

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.917
SHOULD BUILD MANURE PONDS TO

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.654
CAPTURE THAT MANEUVER- SO WE

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.988
CAN PUT THAT BACK ON THE FIELD

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.556
THIS FERTILIZER THIS WAS PRIOR

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:17.692
TO THE CLEAN WATER ACT- SO MY

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.427
DAD AND HIM BUILT THOSE YOU

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:20.695
KNOW WITH THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:22.063
WE ARE WE ARE VERY LUCKY THAT

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.531
WE HAVE. THE CLAY PAN THERE

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.066
THAT THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THOSE

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.634
THE BOTTOM THOSE PAWNS WITHOUT

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:31.639
LEAKAGE INTO THE WATER TABLE- I

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:32.707
WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT THAT. TO MILK

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:33.574
THE MEDICARE AT THE LAND COULD.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:36.210
COULD HANDLE- AND THAT THAT

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.545
LAND WOULD GIVE BACK TO YOU

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:39.781
AND- MOVING THROUGH. OUR GRANTS

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.282
BE AROUND MY GRANDFATHER WHEN I

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.684
WAS YOUNGER AND THEN PARTNERS

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.085
WITH MY DAD FOR ABOUT TEN

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:45.720
YEARS. I FINALLY BOUGHT THE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.089
BUSINESS OUT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.158
SEVEN AND RUN IT MYSELF. I'VE

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.894
ALWAYS LOOKED FOR PROGRAMS THAT

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.530
WERE OUT THERE. TO HELP THE

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:58.066
DAIRY INDUSTRY- IN THE EARLY

01:28:58.132 --> 01:28:59.734

WE- WE INJECT THAT MANY WERE

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:16.017
INTERROGATION SYSTEM. WE SAW A

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.186
HUGE INCREASE IN A PRODUCTION

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.254
OF OUR SILAGE FIELDS BY DOING

01:29:20.321 --> 01:29:22.223
THAT THAT PLANT GETTING AT THE

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.859
RIGHT TIME- OTHER THINGS THAT

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:25.560
WE'VE DONE IS I WAS THE FIRST

WASTEWATER TO IRRIGATE. THEY

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.077
WERE RUNNING INTO SOME.

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:44.345
PROBLEMS WITH NITROGEN

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.813
PHOSPHOROUS WITH THE WATER

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.615
BOARD AND THEY CAME TO ME AND

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.751
THEY SPEND ABOUT A HUNDRED. AND

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.819
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- ON A

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.155
PROJECT OF TAKING CATTLE

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.890
ACTUALLY CREATING A CONCRETE

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.625
WALKWAY. THROUGH AN AREA THAT

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:00.661
COULD POSSIBLY RUN OFF THE FARM

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:01.629

DIGEST ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.406
BEING DONE IN THE VALLEY. WE

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.808
ALL KNEW IN OUR AREA THAT THAT

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:16.077
WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.780
BENEFIT THE SMALLER DAIRIES- SO

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.847
BUNCH OF US KIND OF GOT

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:21.215

I APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEE FOR

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.368
MOVING FORWARD WITH THESE BUT-

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:41.569
IT HAS BEEN A HUGE HELP TO US

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:44.839
SO. WE HAVE AN AIR PROJECT- WE

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.008
ARE PROBABLY ABOUT FORTY FIVE

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:48.042
DAYS ABOUT AWAY FROM BEING

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:51.212
FINISHED- WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN-

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.647
INPUT AUTOMATIC SCRAPERS AND A

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.782

GO TO A SCHOOL SMALL SUMP PUMP

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:58.986
THE PUMP THROUGH A SEPARATOR.

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.188
AND WE WILL SEPARATE THAT

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.722
MANEUVER AND REUSE IT IS

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.491
BETTING SO IT'S- IT'S GONNA

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.827
TAKE- VIA A LABOR SAVINGS FOR

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.929
US IT'S GOING TO BE. AN INPUT

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:09.297
SAVINGS WERE WE WERE BUYING

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:11.599
WASHED RIVER SAND- WILL BE ABLE

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.134
TO UTILIZE THAT MANEUVER BACK.

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.903
PLUS THE AMOUNT OF METHANE AND-

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.606
DIESEL THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:20.141
REDUCING CARBON GO AND- WITH

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:23.177

ON SITE. AND UTILIZE THAT BACK

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:29.417
ONTO OUR PROPERTY TO WHERE

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.919
WE'VE JUST SPREAD IT AS A US

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:34.255
DRIVE WITH A MAN WHO WERE- THAT

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.090
PROJECT HAS BEEN. SOMETHING

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.793
THAT HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT- IT

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.163
WAS TOUGH TO GET INTO. IT WAS-

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.931
I THINK IF I DIDN'T HAVE UC

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.967
EXTENSION FOR THE TECHNICAL

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.034

APPLICATION INTO TO RECEIVE

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:52.540
THAT GRANT- I THINK THAT'S

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.275
SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD THAT

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:55.576
REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT I

01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:57.378
HEARD- SECRETARY ROSS TALK

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:58.980
ABOUT THAT BUT- THAT IS

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:00.047
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:00.948
IMPORTANT TO THE FARMING

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.617
COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.118
AVAILABLE WHEN WE GO INTO THESE

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:07.421
GRANTS- THE TOUGHEST THINGS I

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:10.625
TOLD- SOMEONE RIVAS WHEN HE WAS

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.193
THERE IS. THE WAY THE MONEY IS

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:15.363
PAID OUT WE ARE ABLE TO- LET.

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:16.731
APPLY FOR MONEY BACK WITH

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:19.367
INVOICES QUARTERLY- IT'S BEEN

01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:20.268
GREAT IF WE'VE HAD A BIG

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:22.003
EXPENDITURE THEY SAID GO AHEAD

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:23.304
AND SEND THE MEN BUT- I'M

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:25.406
BANKROLLING THE SIX HUNDRED

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.041
THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT. I'VE

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:28.476
HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN I

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.977
ACTUALLY WENT INTO MY CREDIT

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.679

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:43.424
BACK TO WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.760
GETTING OUR MONEY. BETWEEN

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:46.627
THREE TO FIVE WEEKS WHICH IT

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:47.828

FIVE TO SIXTY DAYS- THE OTHER

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:52.566
PROJECT I HAVE GOING ON I WAS

SOILS PROJECT- THAT ONE HAS

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:59.173
BEEN. NOT THE WAY I REALLY

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.509
EXPECTED IT WE WERE TOLD WE

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:05.313
WOULD THAT WE- WERE ACCEPTED.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.147
FOR FIVE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:07.882
BEFORE WE GOT PAPERWORK TO SIGN

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:08.983
STILL ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.618
BEFORE WE GOT THE OK TO MOVE

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.053
AHEAD AND THEN- YOU HAVE TO

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.187
HAVE THIS DONE BY THE END OF

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:15.556
THE YEAR. AND THIS WAS MID

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.525
NOVEMBER IF WE WOULD'VE HAD A-

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:18.826
THE WINTER IN SONOMA COUNTY

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:19.860
LIKE WE SHOULD OF THERE'S NO

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:20.928
WAY I WOULD HAVE GOT IT DONE

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:22.330
BUT WE GOT ON IT WE GOT OUR

01:33:22.396 --> 01:33:23.731
SEED IN THE GROUND WE'VE GOT

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:25.199
OUR PICTURES MY DAUGHTER PUT

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.902
TOGETHER A TEN PAGE- REPORT

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:30.071
SENATE. AND THEY SAID WELL

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:31.539
THAT'S THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WE

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:32.940
WANT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT NOW

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:33.975
I'M HEARING THAT MAY NOT SEEN

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:37.345
IN MY MONEY FOR. UNTIL AFTER I

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.914
RAISE THEM THE GROUND. I'VE GOT

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:41.182
ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.616
OUT THERE SITTING IN SEAT

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:43.617
COSTING COMPARABLE COST RIGHT

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:47.321
NOW. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:50.091
ARE. TOUGH FOR THE FORMER- BUT

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:51.859
I STILL THINK THESE PROJECTS.

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.861
NEED TO HAPPEN AND OR AND YOU

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:56.998
KNOW I REALLY. THANK THE STATE

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:57.565
FOR REACHING OUT DOING THESE

01:33:57.631 --> 01:34:00.935
THINGS- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:04.572
IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. THAT WE

01:34:04.638 --> 01:34:06.607
HAVE TO REMEMBER OR THE DAIRY

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:08.342
WE ARE PRICE TAKERS WE DON'T

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.678
GET CENTER PRICE. PRICES SET BY

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:13.314
THE FEDERAL MARKETING ORDER SO

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:15.182
IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN.

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:17.218
LEGISLATORS SUCH AS YOURSELVES

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.553
AND AIR QUALITY BOARD WATER

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.156
BOARDS DECIDE TO BRING ON NEW

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:25.026
REGULATIONS WITH COSTS TO US.

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:28.629
OUR STATE WATER QUALITY BOARD.

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:29.964
10% INCREASE THIS YEAR ON A

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:32.566
DAIRY PERMITS FOR WHAT. BUT WE

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:33.834
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT ITS COST IS

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:35.403
10% MORE WE DON'T GET TO PASS

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:37.038
IT ON SO IT'S JUST GOING TO YOU

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:39.206
KNOW AS- AS JASON SAID IT'S

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:41.542
GETTING INTO OUR BOTTOM LINE- I

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.277
THINK ONE THING THAT. REALLY

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.579
NEEDS TO BE DONE. AS WE MOVE

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:47.882
FORWARD NEW REGULATIONS IS WE

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:49.884
NEED TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.987
TABLE TOGETHER- COMPOST AS WE

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.488
HEARD IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:56.323
MAJOR. THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.491
PUT ON A GROUND FOR CARBON

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:59.326
SEQUESTERING THERE WAS A AN AIR

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.328
QUALITY BILL THAT GOT SHOT DOWN

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:02.463
FINALLY BUT GOING THROUGH THAT

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.331
WAS GOING TO REALLY AFFECT OUR

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:07.068
COMPOST FACILITIES. AND IF WE

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.602
CAN'T HAVE THOSE COMPOST

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.805
FACILITIES CLOSE HOW ARE WE

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.706
GOING TO GENERATE THAT COMPOST

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:13.741
TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON ALL THESE

01:35:13.808 --> 01:35:15.776
LANDS. IT'S CRAZY TO HAUL

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.812
COMPOST FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:19.113
ANDERSON ON ACCOUNT OF THE

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:19.713
FOOTPRINT ALONE IN THE

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.682
TRUCKING. IS MORE THAN WHAT

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:22.349
WE'RE WE'RE STARTING AS

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.418
QUAESTOR SO I THINK THERE HAS

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.420
TO BE SOME SOME OTHER PROGRAMS

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:33.961
THAT. AS I SAID EARLIER I AM I

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.930
AM I ONE OF THOSE GUYS HAVE

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:38.065
ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE FUTURE

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.767
MAYBE I STICK MY NECK OUT YOU

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:40.701
KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.003
SOMETIMES WHEN I GET INVOLVED

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:45.139
IN SOME OF THESE PROJECTS BUT-

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:47.775
I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW REALLY HAPPY

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:50.311
WITH WITH WHAT'S GOING ON- ONE

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:51.479
OTHER QUICK ONE WAS WHEN WE

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.180
WERE TALKING ABOUT FOR GRAZING

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:56.650
AND FIRE RESILIENCE- AS I SAID

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:59.820
I WOULD. REYES A HUNDRED FORTY

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:02.022
ACRES THAT I RENT FROM THE

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:04.358
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.961
OF YOU HIRE A MANAGER TO MANAGE

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.829
THE LAND OR TO MANAGER PROJECT

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:12.500
AND ASKED THEM TO PAY YOU. THE

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:14.668
PROPERTY IS OWNED BY THE STATE.

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.270
IT'S MOSTLY MANAGED BY STATE ON

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.905
THE MANAGEMENT TOOL I SHOULD BE

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:19.607
AT LEAST GETTING IT FOR NOTHING

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:22.143
OR IF NOT GETTING PAID I THINK

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:22.776
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:24.678
HAVE TO LOOK AT. WITH THE

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:26.046
FARMING COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY IN

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:29.250
GRAZING- IS REACHING OUT TO

01:36:29.316 --> 01:36:32.052
THOSE IN PAIN FOR THOSE TYPE OF

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:35.422
PRACTICES. IN SPACE CARBON

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.957
SEQUESTERED IT'S ALL THERE

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.959
WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE THINGS

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:42.796
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. AND THE

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.665
ONLY OTHER WAY TO GO BACK IS GO

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:45.966
BACK TO TOWN AND START TEARING

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:48.369
HOUSES OUTPUT AND PASTURE AND

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:48.936
THINGS BACK AND WE KNOW WE

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:51.405
CAN'T DO THAT. SO REALLY WHEN

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.774
WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.509
KEEP AGRICULTURE INVOLVED KEEP

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.978
AGRICULTURE. GROWING AND

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.181
PROFITABLE THERE HAS TO BE A

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:01.482
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:05.119
WE DO- TO HELP BACK CONTINUE TO

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.921

TILL SEEDING IT IS REALLY SEEM

TO WORK AND YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:15.196

CHANGE TO THE NEW SCHOOL. BUT I

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.612
THINK IT'S THAT THE NUMBERS ARE

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.447
THERE AND THE AVAILABILITY AND

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.649
YOU KNOW AND THOSE THINGS ARE.

THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ALL I

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:42.456
REALLY HAVE ON. ON THAT I THINK

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.124

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:02.736
FIGHTS WE FED UP HERE FOR

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.605

THAT LOOKS LIKE- MY BIGGEST

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:09.576

01:39:09.643 --> 01:39:11.078
FOR ALL THE PANELISTS CAN YOU

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:25.359
ONE THING TO HAVE FUNDING

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.361

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:30.931
THING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO-

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:31.632

FOR- THE WHOLE ORCHARD

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.654
RECYCLING THAT WAS A BAD THAT

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.989
ONE WAS DEFINITELY DO IT WILL

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:23.390
BE NICE IF THEY WERE MORE LIKE

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:27.094
THAT ONE AS A MODEL. I MEAN IN

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.763
THE SMALL GUYS THEY'RE THE ONES

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:30.297
WHO NEED IT THE MOST THEY

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:37.270

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:41.375
STONE IS THAT ME YEP- YEAH SO I

HAVE A SIDE JOB AS WELL- AND TO

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:48.315
BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAD I

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:52.386
KNOWN- YEAH I GUESS THE

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:55.055
ECONOMIC PRESSURES OF

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:58.458
OPERATING- FRUIT PRODUCTION I

01:44:58.525 --> 01:44:59.192
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:00.761
SCARED TO GET INVOLVED BUT I

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:01.995
JUMPED IN BECAUSE IT WAS

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:04.064
ROMANTIC AND ALSO BECAUSE THE

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.599
TREES WERE ALREADY HERE WHEN I

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:08.035
MOVED IN SO I STARTED TO

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:09.970
INTERACT WITH THE TREES AND

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:12.639
WHICH- WHICH THEN MADE ME.

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:15.242
QUESTION HOW DO THE SMALL FARMS

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.543
DO IT YOU KNOW IF I'M GOING

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.078
ORGANIC AND I HAVE MY

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:19.713
CERTIFICATIONS AT MY FOOD AND

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:22.883
SAFETY I'M WORKING WITH THE-

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:28.555
NATURAL- CONSERVATION- EFFORTS.

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.924
IT IS SO BUSY AND I'M PUTTING

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.726
SO MUCH INPUT INTO IT AND

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:35.762
THERE'S LITTLE RETURN- IT

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:38.298
FORCED ME TO LOOKING TO

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:39.599
SPECIALTY CROPS INTO

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.034
DIVERSIFIED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:43.170
THE MY MENTOR FARMERS OUT HERE

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.738
TOLD ME TO DO- THEY SAID IF YOU

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:48.108
REALLY WANT TO SURVIVE YOU. YOU

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.676
YOU NEED TO DIVERSIFY AND-

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:52.479
THINK OF THIS IN IN THE BIG

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:54.881
PICTURE- SO LIKE I SAID I

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:56.316
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD I

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.385
KNOWN HOW HOW VERY VERY

01:45:58.452 --> 01:45:59.720
CHALLENGING THIS IS A FIGHT

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.688
WOULD HAVE DONE IT YET I'M SO

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:03.490
GLAD I DID BECAUSE NOW I FEEL

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.192
LIKE WE CAN SERVE AS A MODEL

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:07.594
AND HOPEFULLY IN ROLE MORE

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.529
YOUNG PEOPLE INTO AGRICULTURE.

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:10.864
IS WHAT I'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.466
WITH A SMALL FAMILY FARMS IN MY

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:14.234
AREA IS THAT THERE AREN'T

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.536
ENOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE TO REPLACE

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.205
THE OLDER FARMERS WHO WILL BE

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:20.240
RETIRING THIS GENERATION SO

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:21.641
THERE NEEDS TO BE AND SENATE

01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:23.910
THERE NEED TO BE LAND THERE

01:46:23.977 --> 01:46:27.714
NEEDS TO BE- RETURN ON THE

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:32.352
CROP- JUST. MORE ENCOURAGING-

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:35.021
PROGRAMS I AM VERY LUCKY THAT I

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:36.289
DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON GRANTS

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:40.127
AND BANK LOANS TO DO THIS BUT-

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:41.595
THIS YEAR WAS REALLY HARD

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.597
BECAUSE ALL OF MY OTHER SIDE

01:46:43.663 --> 01:46:45.632
GIGS WERE CANCELLED YOU KNOW AS

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:48.568
AS WE MANY OF US MANY OF US

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:50.904
HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE- SO I

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:52.839
LOOKED I LOOKED EVEN CLOSER AT

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.908
MY FRUIT PRODUCTION AND HOW WE

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:59.613
COULD. FIND MORE BENEFITS IN IN

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:03.483
BEING HERE. COULD I JUST GIVE

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.485
YOU ONE QUICK YEAH THE THREE OF

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.053
US OF KIND OF TALK ABOUT SMALL

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.188
FARMS AND AS I MENTIONED YOU

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.290
KNOW THAT IN YOUR DISTRICT WE

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:11.124
HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF LARGE

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:14.161
DAIRIES. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.996
EASIER FOR THEM. THEN IT IS FOR

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:17.330
THE SMALL FOR. THEM THEY'RE

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:18.498
LOOKING AT LARGER NUMBERS

I'M BUT RIGHT HERE IN ACTUALLY

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.428
IT THAT THE TOUGHEST PART ABOUT

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:58.331
THAT WAS- ORIGINALLY WHEN IT

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:00.200
WHEN IT STARTED I HAD A-

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:02.402
GRAYSON AGREEMENT WITH THEM.

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:04.371
AND SOMETHING WENT. HOW KATHY

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:06.873
WALTERS HERE AT THE STATE AND-

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.241
WE HAD TO PUT IT ALL OUT TO

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.110

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:11.578
THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE BID

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:14.581
PROCESS OF A STATE BID PROCESS.

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:16.483
GO THROUGH WALKING THROUGH. I

01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:18.785
THINK THE APPLICATION WAS

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:22.422
TWENTY. ABOUT TWENTY PAGES.

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:24.391

DID IT WHERE I CAME OUT. OKAY

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.967
WAS BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE.

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:34.935
IN THE WATER SO I DID IT PRETTY

01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:38.672
CHEAP. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK

01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:44.344

THINGS THAT'S KIND OF

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.438
CUMBERSOME TO GO THROUGH. IF

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:50.210
NO INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY HAVE

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.512
WATER. WE HAVE IT THERE SEVENTY

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.880

SITTING THERE NOW FOR. OVER TEN

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:56.950
YEARS NOTHING'S BEEN ON IT

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.585
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATER. AND

01:50:58.651 --> 01:50:59.853
THEY HAD A FARMER THAT WAS

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:00.854
GRAYSON AT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.188
OPEN THE GATE. WHEN HE WHEN

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.923

THAT GET THAT GROUND BE

01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:06.359
CERTIFIED ORGANIC SO NOW IT'S

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:09.863

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:10.590
IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING WE SEE

01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:11.491
THAT WITH THAT STATION

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:13.226

SO- BUT I CAN SEE THAT IT'S

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:42.188
CHALLENGING AND IN MY DISTRICT-

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:44.057
MOST OF THE FARMS ARE SMALL

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:46.926
FARMS WITH THEIR DAIRIES OR- A

LANDSCAPE- I COULD AFFORD TO BE

01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:13.746
MORE OF AN ABSENTEE FARMER AS

01:54:13.813 --> 01:54:16.316
MANY GENTLEMAN FARMS AND SMALL

01:54:16.382 --> 01:54:18.685
FARM FAMILY FARMS CAN DO- BUT I

01:54:18.751 --> 01:54:20.153
WANTED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.988
IN BETWEEN ALL OF THE AVOCADO

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:25.925
TREES. IS A RELATIVELY LARGE

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:30.096
AMOUNT OF REAL ESTATE SO WE- I

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:32.031
CHOSE THE SPECIALTY CROPS OF

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:34.901
COFFEE AND BANANAS- FOR THE

01:54:34.968 --> 01:54:37.971
LOCAL ASPECT BECAUSE COFFEE.

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:39.072
HAS NEVER BEEN GROWN ON THE

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:40.707
MAINLAND UNITED STATES BEFORE

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.108
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:44.344
SO I WANTED TO ENCOURAGE AND

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:48.414
PROMOTE LOCAL. PRODUCE AND

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:50.550
BANANAS THE SAME WAY ARE. YOU

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:51.784
WE JUST WE CAN'T BY LOCAL

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.386
BANANA AT THE GROCERY STORE SO

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:55.655
I WANTED TO ADD SOME MORE LOCAL

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:58.992
VALUE TO RIGHT HERE AND REDUCE.

01:54:59.058 --> 01:55:00.927
I WOULD SAY MY CARBON FOOTPRINT

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:05.231
IN MINE IMPORTING OF COFFEE AND

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:06.699
BANANAS LET'S SAY. SO ADDING IT

01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:10.270
INTO OUR PROGRAM IT ALLOWED TO-

01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:12.839
MY STAFF WHO WHO'S HERE TO JUST

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.474
CONTINUE TO FLY ME LABOR IS

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.576
PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:20.146
THING THAT HAS CHANGED- BUT-

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:21.514
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO DENSE

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:22.749
AND KIND OF SHARING THE

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.517
IRRIGATION SYSTEM- WE'RE NOT

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:26.953
USING THAT MUCH MORE WATER IN

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.623
YET WE HAVE. FOUR THOUSAND MORE

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:32.558
TREES THAN WE STARTED WITH- SO

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:33.559
THEY WERE REALLY A LOT OF

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:36.629
BENEFITS- WE HAD SOME AREAS

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.164
THAT HAD SOME EROSION PROBLEMS

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.533
PRIOR TO OUR MORE AGGRESSIVE

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.402
PLANTING AND NOW WE'RE MORE OF

01:55:42.468 --> 01:55:45.104
A SPONGE BECAUSE AS THE AS IT

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:46.939
RAINS WE CAN COLLECT THAT WATER.

01:55:47.006 --> 01:55:48.241

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:53.365
NEW. CROP TO THE STATE THE DOES

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:57.970
THAT HAVE BARRIERS- DITCHED HOW

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:58.437
TO DESCRIBE WHAT THAT

02:02:58.504 --> 02:03:00.806
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIKE. YEAH

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:02.975
CALIFORNIA HAS GREATER WORK FOR

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:04.610
COFFEE AND THE REASON IT'S

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.445
NEVER BEEN GROWN HERE IS REALLY

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.980
THE MARKET BECAUSE COFFEE HAS

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:10.182
ALWAYS BEEN- THE BOTTOMLESS

02:03:10.249 --> 02:03:13.986
CUP. FREE REFILLS CETERA AND-

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:17.590
OUR OUR LABOR LABOR COSTS AND

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:20.659
WATER COSTS- JUST OUTWEIGH YOU

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:24.163
KNOW THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO-

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.131
BUT LUCKILY NOW THERE'S A

02:03:25.197 --> 02:03:29.068
pMORE ENTHUSIASM FOR COFFEE AS

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:30.836
WELL AS LOCAL COFFEE AND LOCAL

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:32.872
PRODUCE SO THEY THEY GO WELL

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:37.143
TOGETHER. BECAUSE THE COFFEE

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.744
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA STILL SO

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:41.213
YOUNG THERE'S REALLY NOT ENOUGH

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.482
OF IT YET TO FILL THE DEMAND

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:46.085
WHICH MAKES THE COFFEE PRICES

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:48.888
ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE RECOVERING

02:03:48.954 --> 02:03:50.322
LABOR AND WATER OF COURSE BUT

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.624
WE'RE ALSO WE HAVE A VERY RARE

02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:52.958
PRODUCT AND SO IT'S VERY

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.460
EXCITING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.428
THE GOAL. IS TO ENROLL MORE

02:03:56.495 --> 02:03:58.764
MORE FARMERS INTO THE COFFEE

02:03:58.831 --> 02:04:01.700
INDUSTRY- IS LOOKING AT IT LIKE

02:04:01.767 --> 02:04:03.836
WINE WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO HERE

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.672
IN CALIFORNIA- THE MORE FARMS

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:08.474
WE HAVE PRODUCING COFFEE

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:10.242
EVENTUALLY THAT PRICE WILL COME

02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:12.178
DOWN IN MORE MARK- COFFEE

02:04:12.244 --> 02:04:14.413
SHOPS. AND CONSUMERS IN

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.781
CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.249

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:18.751
CALIFORNIA GROWN COFFEE BUT

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:21.387
RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL SO YOUNG

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:22.788
AND IT'S SUCH A SPECIALTY CROP.

02:04:22.855 --> 02:04:27.426
THAT IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:29.028
COFFEE IT'S- BY IT'S FOR. THE

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.763
SPECIALTY COFFEE CONNOISSEUR AT

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:33.599

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.701
ENVIRONMENT CAN SUPPORT IT-

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.002
CALIFORNIA'S LEADER IN AG

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.270
ANYTHING WE GET OUR HANDS ON

02:04:59.925 --> 02:05:02.461
ME INTO HOW TO TASTE COFFEE AND

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:03.095
IT JUST KIND OF BLEW ME AWAY I

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.097
DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE REALLY

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:06.799
THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN PICK UP

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:08.167
THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS IN COFFEE

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:10.369
BEANS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:11.637
TRYING TO WORSE UNANSWERED

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:12.638
QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHER

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.106

BAY WE WENT. IN ON WE BEING YOU

KNOW THE OIL ALL OF OUR FARMERS

02:05:25.784 --> 02:05:27.486
IN IN DERRY MAN- AND DIRTY

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:30.623
PEOPLE- TO SUSTAINABILITY. VERY

02:05:30.689 --> 02:05:32.224
EARLY HOW YOU TALK ABOUT BEING

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:33.926
THE FIRST IN CINEMA FOR ORGANIC

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:37.029
BUT A LOT OF US. A LOT OF. US

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:38.264
IN THE NORTH BAY TO SWITCH

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:41.533
OVER- PROBABLY PROCEEDING. AS

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.236
YOU DID MUCH OF THE REST OF THE

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:46.038
STATE AND EVEN THE NATION. WHAT

02:05:46.105 --> 02:05:47.640
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER.

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:50.743
SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES THAT

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:53.112
YOU'VE ENGAGED IN. YOU TALK A

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:54.613
LITTLE ABOUT SCALE EVERYONE HAS

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.181
CHALLENGES NO MATTER THE SCALE

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.284
THAT YOU'RE AT- WHAT THE

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.319
CHALLENGES ARE EVEN SOME OF THE

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:01.520
THINGS THAT MAKE YOUR YOUR

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.889
ENTRY POINT EASIER. BECAUSE OF

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:06.225
SCALE OR EVEN REPEAT THE REGION

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:10.863
THAT YOU COME FROM. I THINK YOU

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.731
KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:13.565
KNOW THE BIGGEST ONE IS

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:16.302
PROBABLY WATER QUALITY YEAH-

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:17.836
THAT IS PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:20.472
ONE. FROM THAT SCALE SIDE

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:22.608
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:23.575
THE STATE WATER QUALITY BOARD

02:06:23.642 --> 02:06:26.011
LOOKS AT. THE THEY SEE ALL

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:28.147
THEIR USES THE SAME. CENTRAL

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.448
VALLEY HAS OUR GROUNDWATER

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:30.883
PROBLEMS YOU KNOW WORD NITRIC

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:33.786
PROBLEMS. WE HAVE RUN OFF YOU

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:36.956
KNOW INTO- OR WOULD POTENTIALLY

02:06:37.022 --> 02:06:39.692
RUN OFF INTO WATERSHEDS. BUT

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:42.528
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST IT'S

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:48.067
A PERK HOW. COST PER DAIRY. SO

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:49.068
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.869
NORTH BAY HAS DONE AS I STE AS

02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:52.204
I MENTIONED WE HAD THE ANIMAL

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:54.306
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.141
THROUGH SOME KIND OF FORM-

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:58.243
STARTED IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES

02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:00.546
WHEN CALVIN PARCHMENT A FISHING

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:02.414
GAME AT THAT TIME COULD NOT

02:07:02.481 --> 02:07:03.282
COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO DO

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:06.418
THE TESTING WE IS THURMOND

02:07:06.485 --> 02:07:09.188
HIRED. THIRD PARTY- PAST UC

02:07:09.254 --> 02:07:12.491
EXTENSION AND- JERRY GUY PASS

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:14.460
WESTERN UNITED FIELD

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:16.662
REPRESENTATIVE THAT HAD. THE

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:17.696
KNOWLEDGE OF THE DAIRIES HAD

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:19.298
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAND BUT

02:07:19.365 --> 02:07:21.200
ALO WAS VERY REPUTABLE AND WE

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.434
PAID HIM TO GO OUT AND DO THE

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:23.869
SAMPLING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:27.373
THREE. THREE GUYS SAID THAT

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:29.608
SAMPLE WE SAMPLED OVER SIXTY

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:33.012
SITES BETWEEN SNOW MARIN COUNTY.

02:07:33.078 --> 02:07:34.213
IN THOSE SITES OR YOU KNOW

02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:35.280
THOSE REPORTS ARE TURNED INTO

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:36.849
THE WATER BOARD BUT EVERY YEAR

02:07:36.915 --> 02:07:38.150
WERE FOUGHT BY ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.918
GROUPS THAT THE DAIRIES ARE

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:40.519
POLLUTING OR NOT DOING A GOOD

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:43.522
ENOUGH JOB. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:44.023
THE TOUGHEST THAT'S THE

02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:45.891
TOUGHEST ONE IS WHEN. WE'RE

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.493
WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO

02:07:47.559 --> 02:07:50.496
RUN THE FARM. IT REDUCES WILL

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:52.164
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BIGGEST

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:52.698
CHALLENGE AND I SAID IT'S

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:55.501
MANURE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE ALL

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:57.436
IT TAKES IS ONE LITTLE MISTAKE.

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:58.470
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY'S

02:07:58.537 --> 02:07:59.671
GOING BY THE ROAD THEY SAY

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:00.839
APPROVED IN FRONT OF YOUR FARM

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:02.307
AND THEY SEE YOU KNOW YOU'RE

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:04.510
YOU'RE GONNA GET FINE- WE'VE

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:05.844
BEEN VERY PROACTIVE THAT WAY

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:07.246
AND I THINK MOST OF THE FORMS

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:09.748
IN OUR AREA HAVE. I THINK MAYBE

02:08:09.815 --> 02:08:11.316
IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER FOR THE

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:12.851
LARGER DAIRIES IN CENTRAL

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:14.019
VALLEY BUT THEY HAVE COME SO

02:08:14.086 --> 02:08:15.387
FAR AND WHAT YOU KNOW WITH THE

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:17.756
HELP OF CARES. HELP WEST UNITED

02:08:17.823 --> 02:08:19.792
IN OUR OTHER- JERRY

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:20.793
ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:22.895
MOVED. LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD

02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:25.030
OF WHERE THE GEHRY ENTRY WAS

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:27.199
YEARS AGO BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:28.100
YOU START LOOKING AT WHEN THOSE

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:30.035
FEES COME FROM THE STATE I KNOW

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:32.471
IT'S A PER CAL BUT STILL. IF

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:35.707
YOU DO THE MATH ON. THREE

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:36.275
HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED CALS

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:38.343
IT'S COSTING US MORE MONEY.

02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:41.447
THAN THE PER CALIFIA AT FIVE

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:42.548
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CALS.

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:43.348
BECAUSE IT STARTS GETTING SO

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:44.583
HIGH SO THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.318
WE'RE GOING TO CAP IT HERE. BUT

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:47.553
IT ACTUALLY COSTS THE SMALLER

02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:49.054
FARMER MORE MONEY FOR THEIR

02:08:49.121 --> 02:08:50.489
STATE WATER QUALITY FEE BECAUSE

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:52.925
OF. IF YOU DO THE MATH. YEAH

02:08:52.991 --> 02:08:55.027
I'D IN. YEAH I. PRAISE THE

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:57.529
RISK- IN INVENTOR TAKING THAT

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:58.097
JASON HAD MADE AND

02:08:58.163 --> 02:09:00.799
DIVERSIFYING- HIS CROPS YOU

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:05.871
TOOK RISKS. IN SOME OF THE-

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:06.405

SO- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.026
HERE WITH US DOCTOR AND WE LOOK

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:09.628
FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS. THANK

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:13.231
YOU. I HAVE SAY THAT LAST

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:15.367
SESSION WAS FANTASTIC- BUT

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:17.469
THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:19.604
TO- BE ABLE TO PRESENT MY

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:21.973
RESEARCH I'M GOING TO SHARE THE

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:30.549
SCREEN. ALL I CAN FIND IT-

02:16:30.615 --> 02:16:36.221
RIGHT HERE. WELL SEE THAT. YEAH

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:41.092
OKAY. LET'S MAKE AN

02:16:41.159 --> 02:16:48.833
INTERPRETATION MONIQUE- CHANGE.

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:53.138
YES S. GOOD FROM THERE

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:57.442
PROFESSOR OKAY. GLASSMAKERS ARE

02:16:57.509 --> 02:17:01.479
AGAIN SORRY. IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:04.416
GET IT BACK ALL RIGHT- THE GOAL

02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:08.853
IS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO.

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.488
BOTH MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THE

02:17:10.555 --> 02:17:11.723
CARBON CONTENT OF SOILS AS A

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:14.292
VERY IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE IT IT.

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:15.927
IT ADDRESSES MANY ENVIRONMENTAL

02:17:15.994 --> 02:17:19.631
SERVICES AND IT ALSO. HELPS IN

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:21.766
IN CROP PRODUCTIVITY- IN THAT

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.535
IT MAINTAINS STABILITY AND

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:25.904
PROVIDES. MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:28.540
RESOURCES. THERE'S A BRIEF

02:17:28.607 --> 02:17:30.075
OUTLINE OF GOING ONLY GO

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:31.943
BRIEFLY OVER SOME. OF THE

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.511
WORKING LANDS INNOVATION CENTER

02:17:33.578 --> 02:17:36.014
I WAS ASKED JUST TO. MENTION

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:39.384
IT- I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:41.219
CONCLUSIONS IN BY. AND WHAT I'M

02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:42.721
GOING TO SAY AND I'M GOING TO

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.023
SAY THAT. THE ADOPTION MYRICK

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.024
MICROIRRIGATION HAS

02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:47.392
DRAMATICALLY REDUCED NITROUS

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:49.461
OXIDE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:49.527 --> 02:17:52.597
AGRICULTURE. IN A REPORT THAT

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:55.166
WE DID FOR CARB- I'M THE

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:56.635
BIOPHYSICAL POTENTIAL TO REDUCE

02:17:56.701 --> 02:17:58.870
DOCTORS OXIDE WE DETERMINED OR

02:17:58.937 --> 02:17:59.571
OR FROM THE LITERATURE WE

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:02.207
DETERMINED THAT. IF YOU KEEP IT

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:04.242
IN FARMLAND BASICALLY. PRODUCES

02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:06.444
UP TO LESS THAN ARE SEVENTY

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:08.546
TIMES LESS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:10.782
OF BLANK USE LIKE URBAN OR

02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:13.618
DEVELOPED. WELL WE HAVE SOME

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.720
DECADE ALONG RESEARCH THAT'S

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:17.088
BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE

02:18:17.155 --> 02:18:18.289
NINETEEN EIGHTIES AT UC DAVIS

02:18:18.356 --> 02:18:20.158
TO ADDRESS THAT POTENTIAL TO

02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:22.060
SEQUESTER CARBON. WE LOOK

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:23.595
MOSTLY AT COVER CROPS COMPOST

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:27.966
IN THE WAR AND CROP ROTATIONS.

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.134
ONE CARRY OUT A BOX QUESTION

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.835
CARBON IS THAT YOU NEED TO ADD

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:33.204
MORE NITROGEN. AND THAT I WANT

02:18:33.271 --> 02:18:35.473
TO HELP WITH THE POLICY SLIDE

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:40.612
RULE. BALL SO THE WORKING LANDS

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:42.914
INNOVATION CENTER WAS- THE

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.816
PROJECT BEEN FUNDED BY THE

02:18:44.883 --> 02:18:47.318
STATE WELL IT'S LOOKING AT

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:49.888
OTHER TYPES OF WAYS TO INCREASE

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.756
ALL CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:18:51.823 --> 02:18:53.992
PARTICULARLY CRUSHED. AND

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:56.094
BAYRAKTAR ALSO LOOKING A

02:18:56.161 --> 02:19:01.366
COMPOST- COMPOST IS NOW. SIR WE

02:19:01.433 --> 02:19:03.068
HOPE TO DO THAT ARE DIVERT FOOD

02:19:03.134 --> 02:19:03.902
WASTE FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:05.036
COMPOSTING FACILITIES TO

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:06.905
INCREASE BOTH THE AMOUNT AND

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:08.807
QUALITY OF THE COMPOST. SOME

02:19:08.873 --> 02:19:10.341
PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE

02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:11.576
PROJECT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE

02:19:11.643 --> 02:19:14.045
INCREASED BICARBONATE LEVELS IN

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:16.748
SOILS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:17.582
CRUSHED ROCK HAS BEEN APPLIED

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:19.584
TO. WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.454
RESEARCH IT TAKES YEARS THREE

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.188
TO FIVE YEARS OR MORE TO

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:25.123
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:27.559
IS ALL SIGNIFICANT. INCREASES

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:32.564
OUR CARBON. SO JUST TO TAKE

02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.299
HOME THE POINT THESE PROJECTS

02:19:34.365 --> 02:19:35.200
WERE ALL DONE ABOUT TEN YEARS

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:37.168
AGO WHEN BE IMPLEMENTED SB

02:19:37.235 --> 02:19:39.504
THIRTY TWO- LOOKING AT WAYS TO

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:41.773
REDUCE TAXES OXIDE EMISSIONS-

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.575
FROM AGRICULTURE IT TURNS OUT

02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:46.144
THAT. IT'S ADOPTING NEW

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:48.213
TECHNOLOGIES PARTICULARLY MICRO

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:50.982
IRRIGATION SYSTEMS. HAVE

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:52.550
RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC

02:19:52.617 --> 02:19:55.687
REDUCTION OF. NITROUS OXIDE

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:58.056
EMISSIONS WHICH IN ITSELF

02:19:58.123 --> 02:20:01.092
REQUIREMENT FOR BETTER THEN- IT

02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:02.360
FROM A COUPLE OF CLIMATE

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:04.729
WARMING POTENTIAL AND QUESTION

02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:08.533
FOR CARBON IT'S- BECAUSE IT CAN

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:09.400
BE DONE EVERY YEAR HE COULD BE

02:20:09.467 --> 02:20:13.304
DEBT CONSISTENTLY. AND YASSER

02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:16.541
TO COURT- SO JUST HERE QUICKLY

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:22.180
MOVES. IN MOST OF OUR STUDIES

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:23.848
EXACTLY IN EVERY EXAMPLE EAT

02:20:23.915 --> 02:20:27.519
HEALTH WEALTH WELL IN GRAPES.

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:29.521
ALMONDS AND WALNUTS IF YOU HAVE

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:31.089
A MICROIRRIGATION SYSTEMS LIKE

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:32.690
A SUBSURFACE DRIP SYSTEM THAT

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:34.793
CAN BE SURPLUS. OUGHT IT

02:20:34.859 --> 02:20:36.728
GENERALLY PRODUCES LESS MATCHES

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:38.930
OXIDE AND WHERE YOU CAN ADD

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:41.266
KNOW THAT CHEAPER LIGHTER UNDER

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:43.401
FLOOD IRRIGATION SYSTEM. SO WE

02:20:43.468 --> 02:20:45.403
ARE QUITE ENTHUSED ABOUT THIS

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:47.338
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT OF

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.606
GET THIS OUT AND EVERY TIME I

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:51.276
THINK IT'S COOL BUT NEVER SEEMS

02:20:51.342 --> 02:20:54.479
TO REALLY RESONATE AND I JUST

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:55.079
WANNA MAKE IT RESONATE HERE.

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.548
THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

02:20:56.614 --> 02:21:02.353
LOOKING. FOR SO. EVERYONE KNOWS

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.989
THE FORMER NUMBER OBJECTIVES IT.

02:21:05.056 --> 02:21:08.326
INQUIRES ABOUT QUITE SIX TONS

02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:10.028
OF CARBON THREE YEAR ALLEN

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.996
AVERAGED ACROSS ALL GLOBAL

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:14.065
LANDS OUR OUR GLOBAL

02:21:14.132 --> 02:21:16.301
AGRICULTURAL LAND. ATTENTIONAL

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:17.702
FROM RESEARCH STUDIES SUGGEST

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:19.470
AN AGRICULTURE CROPLAND IT'S

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:21.506
ABOUT WHAT WHAT THE ONE POINT

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:23.842
TWO COUNTS OF CARPER. TONS OF

02:21:23.908 --> 02:21:26.477
CARBON PER HECTARE PRETTY.

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:27.679
GRAZING LANDS IN THE SAME ORDER

02:21:27.745 --> 02:21:31.082
OF MAGNITUDE- DISTURBS SOIL AS

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:32.750
WELL WHAT I WOULD CALL OUT

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:35.420
PEATLAND RESTORATION AND- DELTA

02:21:35.486 --> 02:21:36.221
WHICH HAS A MUCH HIGHER

02:21:36.287 --> 02:21:38.389
POTENTIAL I THINK MORE EFFORT

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:40.425
SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE DELTA IN

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:43.428
RECOVERING WELL SOILS AND

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.096
MINIMIZING THE EFFECT OF LUCK

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:47.465
INSTABILITY FOR EXAMPLE. AND

02:21:47.532 --> 02:21:50.768
THE WATER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:53.905
PER SE. SO IN CALIFORNIA. I

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:56.441
HAVE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL USING

02:21:56.507 --> 02:22:00.011
COVER CROPS COMPOSTED MANURE-

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:02.347
AND CROP ROTATIONS. YOU GET

02:22:02.413 --> 02:22:04.616
ABOUT QUITE ONE TWO POINT THREE

02:22:04.682 --> 02:22:08.519
TONS OF CARBON ACTIVE. AND I'LL

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:11.022
GO OVER THIS OUR STUDIES THAT

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:14.392
WE'VE DERIVED FROM NATION FROM.

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:17.262
THE STUDY HERE WAS STARTED IN

02:22:17.328 --> 02:22:18.563
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND TWO

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:19.697
THOUSAND TWO WAS POLICY LIKE

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:22.800
FARMING SYSTEM PROJECT IT

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:23.801
LOOKED AT CONVENTIONAL FARMING.

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:25.303
I FARMING THAT INCORPORATED

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:26.771
WINTER COVER CROP AND ORGANIC

02:22:26.838 --> 02:22:30.475
FARMING ORGANIC FARMING IS WITH

02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:31.042
EIGHT COVER CROP AND MANURE

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:37.248
ADDITION- SO YOU SEE THAT THE

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:40.585
ORGANIC SYSTEM. IT'S ABOUT WHAT

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:43.254
MAX OR WHAT WE CAN SEE OUT AS

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:45.156
THESE STUDIES THIS IS POINT

02:22:45.223 --> 02:22:46.624
THREE TIMES PER HECTARE PER

02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:49.060
YEAR SO FOUR TO FIVE TIMES

02:22:49.127 --> 02:22:51.229
MAYBE IN TEN YEARS WHICH IS NOT

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:55.133
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. IF YOU

02:22:55.199 --> 02:22:56.434
JUST DO A COVER CROP ALONG. GET

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:58.202
ABOUT TWO POINT TWO TONNES PER

02:22:58.269 --> 02:23:01.940
HECTARE. IN OUR CENTURY

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:04.342
EXPERIMENT AT RUSSELL RANCH ALL

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:05.944
VERY SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:09.147
DESIGN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. I'LL

02:23:09.213 --> 02:23:11.149
BE CONVENTIONAL IN THIS CASE

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:12.450
AGAIN POPPING OUT WITH STANDARD

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:15.420
TELL. STANGEL THE COVER CROP

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:17.088
HERE WE HAVE LAST BUT IT WAS

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:19.490
THE COVER CROP. IT HASN'T BEEN

02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:21.893
PLANET IS EVERY YEAR- THROUGH

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.194
THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:25.363
EVERY OTHER YEAR. SO THAT'S THE

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:28.066
ISSUE- WITH USING COVER CROPS

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.201
IT HAS TO BE DONE EVERY YEAR TO

02:23:30.268 --> 02:23:32.370
GET THAT POTENTIAL ALL. AND IF

02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:33.471
YOU DO IT EVERY OTHER YEAR ARE

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:35.139
VERY INCONSISTENTLY OR EVEN

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.374
COMPOST ADDITIONS

02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:39.143
INCONSISTENTLY YEAH THAT. THE

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.346
QUESTION DETENTION PRIEST.

02:23:41.412 --> 02:23:43.681
EITHER FOR ARMENIAN SIMILAR TO

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:47.085
THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT POINT

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:47.585
THREE. ANOTHER PROJECT W

02:23:47.652 --> 02:23:49.587
STARTED NINETEEN NINETY NINE AT

02:23:49.654 --> 02:23:52.724
THE UC WEST SIDE OUR RESEARCH

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:55.126
AND EDUCATION CENTER IS WE LOOK

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.028
AT THE FACT IT UNTIL. WE ARE

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:58.229
INITIALLY VERY ENTHUSED ABOUT

02:23:58.296 --> 02:24:00.798
NO DEAL BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO BE

02:24:00.865 --> 02:24:02.166
SEQUESTERING CARBON. LIKE EACH

02:24:02.233 --> 02:24:03.868
WILL BALANCE BUT NOW AFTER

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:05.903
TWENTY YEARS. YOU HAVE TO SORT

02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.772
OF TEMPER OUR ASSESSMENT. AND

02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:09.841
IT SHOWS THAT NO DEAL IS

02:24:09.907 --> 02:24:11.743
ESSENTIALLY MATCH. US THE

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.277
QUESTION CARBON AT THE RATE WE

02:24:13.344 --> 02:24:15.380
THOUGHT. THAT MAKES KIND OF

02:24:15.446 --> 02:24:18.850
SENSE IN AN ARID DRY

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:20.685
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN-

02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:24.422
TURNS OUT THAT CHALLENGE-

02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:26.157
ACTUALLY DID BETTER THAN NO

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:27.859
JAIL WITH NO COVER NOPE NOPE

02:24:27.925 --> 02:24:29.894

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:33.164
YOU ACTUALLY LOST SOME CARBON

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:35.533
INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM. SO MIXING

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:36.901
THAT RESIDUE IN THE SOIL IS

02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:38.069
IMPORTANT TO GET IT TO THE

02:24:38.136 --> 02:24:41.039
MICROBIAL MOUTH TO CONVERT IT

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:42.907
TO SOIL ORGANIC MATTER- THE

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.642
STANDARD TILL COVER CROP I

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:46.544
TURNED OUT TO. GET SIMILAR

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.645
SEQUESTRATION RIGHTS DANDY

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:51.149
ORGANIC SYSTEM. OVER TIME. ADAM

02:24:51.215 --> 02:24:52.884
I THINK HE'S RATES ARE ALSO

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:54.485
PROMISED BY THE FACT THAT THE

02:24:54.552 --> 02:24:55.820
DE SOROS IN THE SOUTHERN SAN

02:24:55.887 --> 02:24:56.788
JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE LOWER

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:58.056
CARBON CONTENT AND THEY HAVE A

02:24:58.122 --> 02:25:01.692
GREATER POTENTIAL. TO SEQUESTER

02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:06.230
CARBON AT A FASTER RATE. AND

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:11.269
SHE- ONE THING I HAVEN'T. RIVAS

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:13.838
LINES WELL- YEAH IN THE ORGANIC

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:15.473
SYSTEM IN THE RUSSELL RANCH

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.809
RECENT DEEP CARBON. THAT

02:25:17.875 --> 02:25:18.843
AMOUNTS TO ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:21.512
AS THIS CARD- BUT WOULD BE VERY

02:25:21.579 --> 02:25:23.014
DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY YOUNGER

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.949
OUR QUALIFICATION TICKETS AT

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:27.652
THE EXPENSE WOULD BE. BUT WE

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:28.886
SEE THAT IN STANDARD TELL IN IN

02:25:28.953 --> 02:25:31.856
IN THE- WEST SIDE- YOU'LL

02:25:31.923 --> 02:25:35.093
STATION. WHERE WE DO SEE DEEPER

02:25:35.159 --> 02:25:36.294
CARBON AS WELL SO IF YOU GO

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.429
BLIND BEYOND THE STANDARD SOIL

02:25:38.496 --> 02:25:40.198
SAMPLING DEPTH WE MAY BE ABLE

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:41.766
TO FIND THE BUSINESS CARD BUT

02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:42.934
THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.635
EXPENSE FOR DOING THAT- IN A

02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:47.638
LOT OF VERY ABILITY SO IF.

02:25:47.705 --> 02:25:48.172
THERE IS A LOT OF PROBLEMS

02:25:48.239 --> 02:25:52.143
ASSOCIATED WITH. ALL SO I'M

02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:56.080
GONNA. BUT ONE THAT WE GET SO

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:58.249
SCIENTISTS TEND NOT ALWAYS

02:25:58.316 --> 02:26:00.451
KNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU SEQUESTER

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:03.654
CARBON IN SOIL YOU HAVE TO

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:05.556
SEQUESTER NITROGEN WITH IT. SO

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.925
FOR EVERY EIGHT TO TEN. OR

02:26:07.992 --> 02:26:09.760
EXCUSE ME EIGHT TO TWELVE ATOMS

02:26:09.827 --> 02:26:12.230
OF CARBON YOU'LL NEED ONE ATOM

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:14.132
OF NITROGEN. THAT'S WHAT THE

02:26:14.198 --> 02:26:16.567
CHEMISTRY OF SOLAR IF MATTER IS

02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:18.703
THAT'S THE STILL KIANA. SO THE

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:21.072
QUESTION CARBON ALSO REQUIRE

02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:23.641
SEQUESTERING NITROGEN. AND IF

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:25.877
WE DON'T SEQUESTER IF WE FOLLOW

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:28.146
THE FOUR PER THOUSAND PROTOCOL

02:26:28.212 --> 02:26:30.715
OUR INITIATIVE I'LL WE WOULD

02:26:30.781 --> 02:26:34.252
NEED TO- TO SOMEHOW EITHER TO

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:36.154
COVER CROPPING OR OR RECYCLING

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.421
AND THAT WE BOTTOM NORMALLY

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:40.491
WASTED HUNDRED EXTRA CARE

02:26:40.558 --> 02:26:42.260
GRANTS PER YEAR OR- AN AMOUNTS

02:26:42.326 --> 02:26:43.694
TO ABOUT FIFTY KILOGRAMS PER

02:26:43.761 --> 02:26:45.329
HECTARE OR PROXIMITY FIFTY

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:47.398
POUNDS. PER ACRE PER YEAR YOU

02:26:47.465 --> 02:26:48.533
HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WHEN WE%

02:26:48.599 --> 02:26:50.134
PUT THESE AMENDMENTS DOWN WE

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:52.003
PUT A COVER CROP IN OR WE PUT

02:26:52.069 --> 02:26:53.604
COUPLES TELL ME THEY WERE DOWN

02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:56.607
WE OFTEN. OR WE HAVE TO BY

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:58.176
STATE LAW ABOUT IT KNOWLEDGE

02:26:58.242 --> 02:27:00.778
WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PLANT.

02:27:00.845 --> 02:27:03.514
AND THAT IS GOING TO BE USED

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:04.815
AND NOT USED TO SEQUESTER

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:06.250
CARBON SO THERE MAY HAVE TO BE

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:09.887
ADDITIONAL. NITROGEN ADDED AND

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:11.722
THAT'S NOT. AND IT'S A SCARY

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:14.058
THING STAY. I BECAUSE WE TO

02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:16.727
HAVE- INCREASED ENERGY

02:27:16.794 --> 02:27:17.862
EFFICIENCY JUMPER OUR-

02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:22.033
RESOURCES AFTER WATER RESOURCE-

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:24.068
DISPUTE WRAP UP- ONE THING I

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:25.636
DID MENTION IS THAT ONCE

02:27:25.703 --> 02:27:27.805
CALIFORNIA. DEVELOP ALL THE

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.273
WATER PROJECTS AND START YOUR

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.108
GETTING PLANNED SO COVERED

02:27:31.175 --> 02:27:32.510
ACTUALLY INCREASED OVER TIME IN

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:33.578
MANY PLACES PARTICULARLY IN

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:34.679
SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:36.647
BECAUSE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF

02:27:36.714 --> 02:27:38.316
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WAS

02:27:38.382 --> 02:27:39.283
GREATER THAN THE NATIVE.

02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:42.787
ECOSYSTEMS SO IN SOME PLACES

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.055
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREASING

02:27:44.121 --> 02:27:45.122
SOIL CARBON REGARDLESS OF THE

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:46.991
INTENSIFICATION HAS OCCURRED

02:27:47.058 --> 02:27:51.629
IN- IN AGRICULTURE- CALIFORNIA.

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:53.864
MY ADDITION HAS DRAMATICALLY

02:27:53.931 --> 02:27:56.300
MATCHES OXIDE EMISSIONS. NO

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:57.768
TELL MAIN INCREASE TOTALS ALL

02:27:57.835 --> 02:28:02.473
CARBON. IN ALL CASES SOCOM'S

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.976
RESTRICTION REQUIRES AN- WE

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:06.510
SHOULD PRIOR TO RESOURCE PRIDE

02:28:06.577 --> 02:28:09.780
PRIORITIZE OUR SOILS- UP WHERE

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.515
WE PUT OUR COMPOST IN THE NEW

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:13.918
ONES AND I THINK AG LAND AT THE

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.386
MOST AND AGAIN SHE BEGIN

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:18.856
FARMLAND IS. ONE OF THE BEST

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:21.659
WAYS TO KEEP UP CLIMATE

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:25.796
FRIENDLY ALL. TYPE OF SCENARIO.

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:28.032
URBAN WITH ABLE. SO CAN WE DO

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:29.533
IT I JUST KIND OF SHOW YOU WE

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.736
CAN QUESTOR CARBON IN

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:34.705
CALIFORNIA. BUT HAS AN ELEGANT

02:28:34.772 --> 02:28:37.308
PAPER BY AND ITS IN PROFESSOR

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:39.443
OF SOIL SCIENCE AT THE

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.944
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:43.881
BERKELEY. I SUBMITTED THIS AS

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:47.151
FOR YOU TO- AS MATERIALS IT'S

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:48.953
EASY IT'S EASY WORKING READING

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:51.389
BUT IT'S VERY VERY. VERY

02:28:51.455 --> 02:28:52.823
ELEGANT. RESENTS THE PROBLEMS

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:56.093
OF. THE QUEST FOR MARKET AND

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.662
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE

02:28:57.728 --> 02:29:05.136
NATURALLY'S TECHNICIAN SIR. AB.

02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:06.837
MOST OF MY NAME A QUESTION A

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:11.275
TON. THIS. EIGHTY THREE. WAY

02:29:11.342 --> 02:29:14.879
ABOVE THE MARK. SO THAT WOULD

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:16.847
HAVE TO BE PUBLIC AND SOME AND

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:17.581
THAT'S BECAUSE THE LARGEST

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:20.318
TRADE COSTS. THANK COME ACROSS

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:23.020
OR- DOING SO CURRENT REQUIRE

02:29:23.087 --> 02:29:26.490
ALL INCOME LABOR ALL HER

02:29:26.557 --> 02:29:28.626
PROPERTIES ACTUALLY IN SHORTS.

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:30.628
I'M NOT ALWAYS SUITABLE RIGHT

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:34.999
SEE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY APPLE.

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:37.401
VERCELLI OF THE QUESTION IS

02:29:37.468 --> 02:29:39.770
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. BOB THE

02:29:39.837 --> 02:29:41.939
LAST ASSISTANCE CHECK

02:29:42.006 --> 02:29:43.040
ASSISTANCE PARTICULARLY FROM

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:44.108
USED COOPER EXTENSION AND

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:47.144
THAT'S TRUST SERVICE TO YOU

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:50.181
FARMERS AND GIVING IT THANK

02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:53.217
INFORMATION. AND TRYING TO HELP

02:29:53.284 --> 02:29:57.688
DO. YOU SEE NEXT HAS BEEN IN

02:29:57.755 --> 02:29:59.857
SOME SECURE EVER SINCE I CAME

02:29:59.924 --> 02:30:02.626
HERE IN NINETEEN SIX. AND

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:03.928
COURSE THESE FARMERS ARE DURING.

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.162
SO I WOULD THAT WE DO THE SAME

02:30:05.229 --> 02:30:13.904
AS WE GET WITH WATER. FILE AND-

02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:15.806
BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS WARMING

02:30:15.873 --> 02:30:17.007
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AGAINST

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:18.476
US IF WE GET SIGNIFICANT

02:30:18.542 --> 02:30:20.845
WARMING IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:23.514
SLOW DOWN. SPEECH AND THAT AND

02:30:23.581 --> 02:30:25.583
JUST SO QUESTION CARBON MAY

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:27.718
IMPACT FUTURE CROP GROWTH IS

02:30:27.785 --> 02:30:29.687
TOO MUCH CARBON COULD BE BACK

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:31.188
TO WE NEED PROBABLY RESEARCH

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:32.923
INTO THAT SO WE KNOW THAT

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.924
INCREASING SOIL CARBON AT A

02:30:33.991 --> 02:30:35.893
REASONABLE RATE. INCREASES PROP

02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:38.562
CROP PRODUCTIVITY INSTABILITY

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:40.965
BUT IF WE- FOUR SIX WE MAY HAVE

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.500
OTHER ISSUES THEN WE SEEN THAT

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.568
HAPPEN IN FOR SYSTEMS THAT WERE

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:46.170
RELEASED LAST BEHIND ENEMY GETS

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:47.938
SLOWER GROWTH OF THE- NEXT

02:30:48.005 --> 02:30:52.476
FORCED. OKAY KEEPING AG LAND

02:30:52.543 --> 02:30:54.412
WILL BE SEVENTY BY UP 270%

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:56.747
TIMES LESS GREENHOUSE GAS

02:30:56.814 --> 02:30:57.481
EMISSIONS THAN OTHER TYPES OF

02:30:57.548 --> 02:31:00.484
LAND USE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

02:31:00.551 --> 02:31:01.352
HERE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:03.654
IS THAT SO CARBON IMPROVE SO

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:05.389
MANY THINGS WATER RETENTION

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:06.891
WATER INFILTRATION YIELD

02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:08.659
STABILITY IN CROPS FOOD

02:31:08.726 --> 02:31:11.195
SECURITY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SO

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:13.330
ANY AMOUNT LOOKS THE CARBON CAN

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:16.901
BE SEQUESTERED WE'LL ALL BE OUT

02:31:16.967 --> 02:31:20.538
AHEAD OF THE GAME AND IN DEEP

02:31:20.604 --> 02:31:22.440
WATERS. THANK YOU. WE REALLY

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:23.207
APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:26.477
IT'S- YESTERDAY THE INFORMATION

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:27.144
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME

02:31:27.211 --> 02:31:29.146
QUESTIONS- AT THE END OF THE

02:31:29.213 --> 02:31:31.649
PANEL- AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT'S

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:34.885
MY PLEASURE TO. WELCOME CAT

POINT ESPECIALLY. THAT WAS

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:18.395
REALLY INTERESTING SO- I'M- MY

02:32:18.462 --> 02:32:20.731
NAME'S CAT TAYLOR AND I'M GONNA

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:22.466
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY

02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:24.134
WE ARE INVOLVED IN THE HEARING

02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:26.737
TODAY- TOMCAT RANCH IS A

02:37:28.672 --> 02:37:30.073
THAT I NEED TO TALK TO

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:31.008
PROFESSOR I HOPE YOU CAN LEARN

02:37:31.074 --> 02:37:32.910
MORE ABOUT THAT. OF THE SIX

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:34.011
CORE PRINCIPLES OF REGENERATIVE

02:37:34.077 --> 02:37:35.646
AGRICULTURE ARE TO CONSIDER THE

02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:37.281
CONTEXT BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:38.482

IT SHOULD WE SHOULD NOTE THAT

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:17.554
THESE PRINCIPLES COMPOUND WHEN

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:19.122
APPLIED TOGETHER FOR MAXIMO THE

02:38:19.189 --> 02:38:22.492

PESTILENCE NEXT SLIDE. SO THE

02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:36.139
IS A DAY OF HOUSE RESTRUCTURING

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.838
MICROSOMAL COMMUNITY THEN

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:10.374
EXCHANGES WITH THAT PLANT IN-

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.174
FOR THOSE CARBOHYDRATES AND

SOIL CARBON IN THE GROUND-

02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:18.615
THERE IS- ADDED BENEFIT TO DEEP

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:20.150
SOIL CARBON IN THE SENSE THAT

02:39:20.217 --> 02:39:22.719
IT REMAINS MORE DURABLY AND IS

02:39:22.786 --> 02:39:23.687

AFTER THE FACT- THE INTEGRATION

02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:30.494
OF LIVESTOCK IS IMPORTANT.

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.496
BECAUSE THOSE ANIMALS ARE

02:39:32.562 --> 02:39:35.399
QUICKLY- CLIPPING OFF JUST THE

02:39:35.465 --> 02:39:37.134
A SHORT BIT OF THE PLANT WHICH

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.468
INSPIRES A PLANT TO GROW AGAIN

02:39:38.535 --> 02:39:39.736
BECAUSE A PLAN IS ALWAYS

02:39:39.803 --> 02:39:41.939
SEEKING TO BALANCE ITS BIOMASS

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.980
SIMPLE SOIL TESTING COMING THAT

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:52.115
WILL HELP US BENCHMARK SOIL

02:39:52.182 --> 02:39:54.584

02:39:56.186 --> 02:40:00.590
WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT. LATER

02:40:00.657 --> 02:40:02.459
NEXT SITE. THE DIFFERENCE IS

02:40:02.526 --> 02:40:04.461
CLEAR TO THE HI AND I KNOW WE

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:05.495
DO NEED TO MEASURE

02:40:05.562 --> 02:40:07.331
SCIENTIFICALLY BUT YOU CAN SEE

02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:09.066
IN THIS PICTURE THE DIFFERENCE

02:40:09.132 --> 02:40:12.069
BETWEEN A DEPLETED SOIL AND A

02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:17.307

02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:36.506
INGENIOUS WAYS FOR THAT SMALL

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:38.374

THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU VERY

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:50.587
MUCH FOR MAKING THAT. POSSIBLE

02:48:50.653 --> 02:48:52.755
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF ISTER

02:48:52.822 --> 02:48:56.693
MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:48:56.759 --> 02:48:58.895
MY QUESTION KIDS AND FUELING

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:01.164
IT'S MORE FOR THE PROFESSOR IN

02:49:01.231 --> 02:49:03.166
REGARDS TO THE MICRO CLIMATES

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:05.502
YOU SHOWED A LOT OF GREAT DATA

02:49:05.568 --> 02:49:06.469
WITH THE YOUR CARBON

02:49:06.536 --> 02:49:08.705
SEQUESTRATION BUT I KNOW WITH

02:49:08.771 --> 02:49:13.276
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE- ISSUES THAT

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:15.211
WE'RE FACING UNIT I KNOW A LOT

02:49:15.278 --> 02:49:16.613
OF TIMES IT DOESN'T GET

02:49:16.679 --> 02:49:18.448
MENTIONED ENOUGH AND I KNOW

02:49:18.515 --> 02:49:21.150
WE'VE- GOT ADDRESS. SLIGHTLY ON

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:22.752
THE LAST PANEL BY JASON BRIDGES

02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:25.154
THE REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURES

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:28.591
IN YOUR GATED LANDS WHERE WE

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:31.928
ARE SEQUESTERING CARBON- IF THE

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:33.963
PROFESSOR RUN ACROSS ANY DATA

02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:36.499
ALONG THOSE LINES I KNOW IT'S

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:38.301
SAID THAT IT'S ABOUT TEN TO

02:49:38.368 --> 02:49:39.569
FIFTEEN DEGREES COOLER WITHIN

02:49:39.636 --> 02:49:41.571
YOUR GATED LANCE VERSES IN

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:43.740
URBAN AREAS BUT ACTUALLY HAVING

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:45.475
THE DATA TO BACK IT UP IS

02:49:45.542 --> 02:49:48.778
ALWAYS A LOT NICER. YEAH THAT'S

02:49:48.845 --> 02:49:50.613
A BIT OF A CHALLENGING QUESTION

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:52.982
BECAUSE THAT A LOT OF THAT DATA

02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:54.584
WAS DEVELOPED UNDER FLOOD

02:49:54.651 --> 02:49:57.153
IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES. AND

02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.755
THERE IS SORT OF A LOT OF APPLE

02:49:58.821 --> 02:50:00.290
TRANSPIRATION THAT LED TO THAT

02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:04.827
COOLING- BOTH FROM THE PLANT

02:50:04.894 --> 02:50:08.531
AND SOIL- NOW WITH THE MICRO

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:11.134
IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES- WATER

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.535
USE EFFICIENCIES GIRLY HIGHER

02:50:12.602 --> 02:50:14.037
YOU HAVE LESS SORELY REPARATION

02:50:14.103 --> 02:50:15.071
YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:16.472
OF PLANT RESPIRATION AND MAYBE

02:50:16.539 --> 02:50:18.408
EVEN MORE BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY

02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:19.943
IS OFTEN INCREASED UNDER THESE

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:21.644
MICRO IRRIGATION SYSTEMS FOR

02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:23.580
EXAMPLE INTIMATE DOES JUST

02:50:23.646 --> 02:50:25.014
CONVERTING TO MY CAREER-

02:50:25.081 --> 02:50:27.183
SUBSURFACE DRIP SYSTEMS GETS ON

02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:29.419
AVERAGE A THIRTY PERCENT.

02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:31.988
INCREASE SO YOU WOULD EXPECT

02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:33.523
PERJURERS O THE SURFACE AREA

02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:36.125
AND- ANY OPERATION FROM THAT

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:37.894
EXAMPLE TRACK- TRANSPIRATION

02:50:37.961 --> 02:50:42.031
FROM THAT. AND SO. YES IT HAS

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:44.701
BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'RE

02:50:44.767 --> 02:50:46.736
GETTING ARE CAN COOL- I THINK

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:47.870
THAT ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES

02:50:47.937 --> 02:50:49.839
THOUGH IS THAT AS CLIMATE WARMS

02:50:49.906 --> 02:50:51.975
AND- I MIGHT BE STEPPING OUT OF

02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:54.210
BOUNDS HERE- IT'S THE NIGHTTIME

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:55.511
TEMPERATURES THAT REMAIN A

02:50:55.578 --> 02:50:57.380
LITTLE HIGHER- VERSES THE

02:50:57.447 --> 02:50:59.616
DAYTIME TEMPERATURES. WHICH ARE

02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:01.451
A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC. BUT THAT

02:51:01.517 --> 02:51:02.552
MAY BE OKAY BECAUSE IF THERE'S

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:03.920
LESS SOIL EVAPORATION AT NIGHT-

02:51:03.987 --> 02:51:08.191
THERE'S. OR OR A BILL WELL

02:51:08.257 --> 02:51:09.792
ANYWAY I WAS GOING TO GOING TO

02:51:09.859 --> 02:51:11.294
SAY THAT IT YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:51:11.361 --> 02:51:12.695
CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THERE

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:13.496
IS A LITTLE BIT OF ABERRATION

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:14.597
BUT STILL TEMPERATURES ARE

02:51:14.664 --> 02:51:16.566
WARMING. SO WHAT IS THE BASE

02:51:16.633 --> 02:51:18.568
LONG BECAUSE WE SEE FOR EXAMPLE

02:51:18.635 --> 02:51:20.370
IN TREE CROPS THERE ARE THEY

02:51:20.436 --> 02:51:23.806
ARE BEING- AFFECTED- FURTHER

02:51:23.873 --> 02:51:26.509
BERLE'S ATION PERIOD FOR

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:27.076
EXAMPLE BECAUSE TEMPERATURES

02:51:27.143 --> 02:51:31.381
ARE RISING. OKAY I THINK I KNOW

02:51:31.447 --> 02:51:32.849
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SAID THAT

02:51:32.915 --> 02:51:34.984
THE SO I WANTED TO ASK THAT- TO

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:36.119
YOU SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I

02:51:36.185 --> 02:51:38.988
KNOW. AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:40.690
WE TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES IN

02:51:40.757 --> 02:51:43.359
CALIFORNIA SUCH AS HOUSING- IN

02:51:43.426 --> 02:51:44.160
IN THE NEED TO BUILD MORE

02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:45.628
HOUSING UNITS AND THINGS LIKE

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:47.430
THAT THEN WE GET INTO THINGS

02:51:47.497 --> 02:51:50.133
LIKE URBAN SPRAWL- THERE. THAT

02:51:50.199 --> 02:51:51.801
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US REMEMBER-

02:51:51.868 --> 02:51:53.436
WE DON'T NEED TO SPRAWL OUT

02:51:53.503 --> 02:51:56.172
INTO AGRICULTURAL AREAS- IN

02:51:56.239 --> 02:51:57.907
LOSE THESE AREAS THAT ARE

02:51:57.974 --> 02:51:59.308
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING FOR

02:51:59.375 --> 02:52:00.677
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:02.211
IMPORTANCE THAT IT IS TO KEEP

02:52:02.278 --> 02:52:04.747
THOSE- AND KEPT THAT IN MIND

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:06.516
BECAUSE WE'RE- WE'RE SEEING TOO

02:52:06.582 --> 02:52:09.719
OFTEN- AT GLANCE WILL GET SOLD

02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:11.654
OFTEN TURN INTO HOUSING UNITS.

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:14.090
AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HELPING

02:52:14.157 --> 02:52:16.359
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT

02:52:16.426 --> 02:52:22.598
WE FACE. HELPED KEEP IT. OKAY

02:52:22.665 --> 02:52:24.500
SO I THINK WITH THAT I KNOW WE

02:52:24.567 --> 02:52:25.401
ARE OVERTIME BUT REALLY

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:27.136

THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AGRICULTURE

02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:24.854
TO MEET CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS
