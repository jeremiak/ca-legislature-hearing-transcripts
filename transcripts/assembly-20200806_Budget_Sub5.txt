IF YOU'RE COMMITTEE STILL GOING ON OKAY I'M GOING TO GIVE OUR OUR CHAIR AND OPPORTUNITY HAVE OPENING COMMENTS FIRST AND THEN I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS. BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAS A COMMITTEE GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS THANK YOU DOCTOR BY APOLOGIZE I CAN'T STAY FOR THIS. VERY IMPORTANT HEARING BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A HEARING GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS AS WELL. LET ME JUST FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR THE COMMITTEES LEADERSHIP. ON LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE OF DJJ- I THINK. RETHINKING HOW WE DO JUVENILE JUSTICE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH. IF WE GET A WRONG WE COULD SEND YOUNG PEOPLE. DOWN A PERMANENT PATH. IN A PERMANENT PRESENCE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF WE DO IT RIGHT. PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. GET EMPLOYMENT GET HOUSING. REALLY BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES SO THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL DECISION BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE STATE HASN'T BEEN DOING IT RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WITH THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE DJJ AWAY FROM CDC ARE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- I WOULD SAY THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AND- SOME OF THE DETAILS I THINK WE- AS A LEGISLATURE. TOOK ON FAITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN HOPES THAT WE COULD MAKE IMPROVEMENTS SEE SOME REFORMS. REPEAT DO BETTER BY ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM. WHAT'S CONCERNING IS THIS YEAR.% THE NEW PROPOSAL TO REALIGN MANY OF THE- THE JUVENILES INTO OUR VARIOUS COUNTIES. AND WHILE WE ARE LOOKING FOR COST SAVINGS IN THIS AREA. THE COST SAVINGS COME BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE RETURN. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE PROPER INVESTMENTS TODAY SO WE SAVE THE DOLLARS DOWN THE ROAD SO INSTEAD OF. USING OUR TAX DOLLARS. ALL THE INDIVIDUALS BECOME TAXPAYERS. AND SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL DECISION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT AGAIN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY TODAY AND SPEND MONEY A LOT MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD. HELLO WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A PROPOSED OFFICE OF YOUTH JUSTICE AT HHS THAT THIS PROVIDES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN A GOOD PLACE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT IN THE RIGHT PROGRAMS I THINK THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT. HOW THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES WILL GO. OUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WERE FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON EACH INDIVIDUAL DOLLAR RATHER THAN THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN WERE NOT. FOCUSED ON COST CUTTING IN ORDER TO. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT TIS PRODUCT IS A BETTER PRODUCT IN THAT WORK PROPERLY SERVING. THESE CUSTOMERS. WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO BETTER BY ALL THESE YOUNG FOLKS WE'VE SEEN NOW OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES THE MISTAKE THAT WE MADE. WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD JUST INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR LONGER. SOMEHOW THAT SOCIETY WOULD BE SAFER HAS IMPROVE THE NECESSARY THE CASE. ALL IT HAS IS GROWN THE BUDGETS OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT TE EXPENSE OF BEING AT THE FRONT HEALTH CARE. THE FUND EDUCATION BE ABLE TO FUND OUR UNIVERSITIES BE ABLE TO FIND THE MOST CRITICAL SERVICES THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DEMANDING IN ASKING FOR. TODAY SO AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS FOCUS ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO PROPERLY SERVE. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. SO THAT THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY STEP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T LEAD THEM DOWN A PERMANENT PATH. I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK VERY HARD ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PROPER SERVICES. THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM AT THIS YOUNG AGE SO THAT THEY CAN GET. THE HELP TO TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND. I FULLY BELIEVE THE GIVEN THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY THAT MANY OF THEM AND MOST OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I THINK AT THIS POINT AS STATE WE HAVE FAILED. IT HAVE A- THE SERVICE. AND THOUGHT. WE SEE THEM LATER ON A LIFE AND UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR ADULT PRISONS SO WITH THAT LET ME JUST THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER FOR CHAIRING THIS HEARING VERY EXCITED ABOUT HEARING FROM THE ADVOCATES AND KNOWING THE RESULTS OF YOUR DELIBERATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAMAGE TO TANKS- WILL COME A LONG WAY. WITH DJJ- MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS CALLED TO SEE WHAT A WHICH WAS THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY. WE HAVE MORE MOVE MORE THAN TEN YOUTH PRISONS WHEN WE HAD MORE THAN TEN YOUTH PRISONS AT OVER TEN THOUSAND INCARCERATED YOUNG PEOPLE. NOW WE HAVE THREE FACILITIES AND EIGHT HUNDRED YOU'VE- LAST YEAR WE SUPPORTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MOVE DJJ TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. ISSUED ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO CLOSE THE J. J. AND WE ALL USE LOCALLY. IT SEEMS RIGHT THAT SUCH A SMALL SYSTEM SMALLER THAN A MIDDLE SCHOOL CAN BE A OF A RELYING TO THE COUNTIES. BUT IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT DJJ REALIGNMENT IT'S ABOUT D. J. J'S REALIGNMENT THE RIGHT WAY. COUNTY SEVEN HAILING THE BEST JUDGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME TO. WHO COULD BE SENT TO DJJ. BUT THEY'RE KEPT LOCALLY SO WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE DONE. WHILE WE MAY SUPPORT A REALIGNMENT YOU THROUGH THE COUNTY WE'RE NOT REALIGNING THE RESPONSIBILITY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WITH FIFTY EIGHT DIVERSE COUNTIES OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY. WE WANT THE CONSISTENT DELIVERY OF EXCELLENT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING STANDARDS ARE ARE ADHERED TO ANDDATA IS COLLECTED TO MEASURE PROGRESS. RACIAL DISPARITIES CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM AS BLACK AND BROWN YOUTH ARE OVER REPRESENTED AT ALL STAGES OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE. OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES CAN HELP TO REDUCE THESE DISPARITIES. I DO NOT SYSTEM IS A BETTER SYSTEM THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO BUT WHAT WE DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN CONTINUE ON THIS POSITIVE TRAJECTORY. WELL THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT GOALS AND SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE. AND OUR PRIMARY GOAL HERE ISN'T TO SAVE MONEY WHEN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN ARE AT STAKE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE DO WHAT'S RIGHT WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE. TO DO THAT RIGHT. BONTA INPUT FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS TOGETHER AND MAKE THE PROGRESS SO ESSENTIAL FOR TO OUR CHILDREN. I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP ANY MA'AM WHERE ANY MEMBER WHO LIKE TO HAVE A COMMENT WE'RE ASKING TO LIMIT OUR-COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES SO THAT WE CAN GET TO OUR OUR- OUR OUR PANEL. IT WOULD HAVE ANY COMMENTS YES MR JONES SAWYER. AND THEN MISTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR HIS HEARING ON IT REALLY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WHEN THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR FIRST PROPOSED TRANSFERRING TO DIVISION. OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I WAS BOTH EXCITED FOR THE PROPOSED POTENTIAL INCREDIBLE. CONCERNED ABOUT LIMITATION. I TEMPTED TO CONVENE MEETINGS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND STAFF AND OUR SENATE COLLEAGUES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND RELEVANT STAKE HOLDERS. SO WE COULD BEGIN DISCUSSING ISSUES OPENLY AND CHART A COURSE FOR THIS SHIP. WHICH WERE NOT INCLUDED TO JOIN THESE MEETINGS. FOR INTO A CONVERSATION FIVE. RIGHT AS A GROUP. THIS IS. JOINING US. I LEARNED THAT WE SPEND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. KID IN DJJ. I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A JUSTIFICATION. FOR THAT FIGURE. AND I BELIEVE THE OUTCOME FOR OUR YOUTH DO NOT MATCH THE INVESTMENT THAT WE ARE MAKING AS A STATE. I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT OUTCOMES FOR OUR YOUTH AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR STATE INVESTMENT. THAT LAST YEAR I REQUEST AN AUDIT AND A SEPARATE SOURCE OF FOR JUVENILES ON PROBATION. THE OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COUNTIES RECEIVED ANNUALLY INDIVIDUAL JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT. THAT AUDIT SHOWED WHAT IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON THAT THERE IS MINIMAL OVERSIGHT. ON THE USE OF THESE FUNDS COUNTY'S EXERCISE. LEVELS BUT GENERALLY MINIMAL ACCOUNTABILITY FINE. AN OUTCOME. ARE NOT. AND THAT IS WHY PLEASE. TO BE PART OF THIS CON. TODAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SHIP THE YOUTH. IN DJJ AND A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YOUTH AND ANNUAL FUNDING TO COUNTIES WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IS UNACCEPTABLE. OUR MOST VALUABLE YOUTH ARE TOO IMPORTANT FOR US TO LET THEM SLIP LET THEM SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE ARE FAILING TO DEMAND BETTER. I SUPPORT PROPOSALS TO CLEARLY OUT IT SPEAKS CLEARLY SPELL OUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AS A STATE FOR INVESTMENT IN YOU SERVICES. I AM TIRED OF YEARS OF BATTLING OVER WHO RECEIVE FUNDS INFIGHTING BETWEEN PROBATION LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS OVER STATE DOLLARS. WE NEED TO SET CLEAR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT OUTCOMES WE WANT TO SEE AN INCREASE READING LEVELS. IT RESET. IMPROVE HEALTH AND STABLE HOUSING ETCETERA WITH THESE CLEAR GOALS COUNTIES CAN DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO WHOMEVER THEY BELIEVE CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES. BUT SHOULD KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUTCOMES AT THE STATE LEVEL LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED MY LEGISLATION. TO STOP REFERRING TO YOUTH AT RISK AND REPLACE TO PRAISE WITH AT PROMISE. WE DID THIS TO HIGHLIGHT AND UPLIFT THE INHERENT POTENTIAL IN EACH OF THESE YOUTH. AND NOT CONTINUE TO BEAT THEM DOWN DUE TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES OR BRING. IF WE TRULY WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PROMISE OF THE USE OF THESE ISSUES THEN WE MUST START DOING BETTER BYE. IT SAID OFTEN THAT OUR BUDGET IS A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES. TODAY WE LIVE WITH LUCKILY WE VALUE OUR AT PROMISE YOUTH AND WILL NO LONGER ALLOW THEM TO SUFFER BECAUSE WE AS ADULTS. HAVE NOT DONE OUR JOBS WE CAN DO BETTER. WE MUST DO BETTER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MR STONE. THANK YOU ACTUALLY EXCITED. AT THE PROSPECT WILL CERTAINLY LAST YEAR THE THOUGHT OF MOVING DJJ TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IN FACT DJJ PROBABLY. STARTED THERE. DECADES AGO. AND NOW WE'RE SORT OF JUMPING TO. REALIGNING YOUTH SERVICES OUT TO COUNTIES AND IF THE REASON THAT'S BEING DONE IS PURELY FISCAL WE WILL FAIL THESE YOU THERE IS AN ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK AT THE COMMITTEES DONE AND HAS BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. TO CREATE A MUCH STRONGER FRAMEWORK BECAUSE THIS IT HASN'T ABSOLUTE INTEREST IN ENSURING CONSISTENCY. L. AND BEST PRACTICES ACROSS ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND THAT HAVE TO BE BUILT INTO THIS PROPOSAL OR WE WILL FAIL THOSE YOU THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE LICENSING REGULATORY AUTHORITY BUT THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SEPARATE FROM. THE THAT THE THINK TANK ASPECT OF WHAT A AT AN AGENCY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED COULD DO WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT IS IF WE END UP WITH IT MATTERING WHERE A CHILD THAT'S IN TROUBLE AND IS BEING SERVED. IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN WE HAVE FAILED OUR YOUTH IN THIS STATE SO HAVING A- THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SEEING. APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF SERVICES ACROSS THE BOARD IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT WE ALSO DJJ AS YOU MENTIONED THAT I'M SURE HAS MADE SOME. STRIDES OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING THE SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE AND OTHERS. THOSE ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY. N. WE NEED A REGIONAL APPROACH OR EVEN ARGUABLY ACE STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT OF A PROGRAM THAT SO THOSE ARE THE DETAILS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FILL IN. OVER TIME AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ULTIMATELY HAVE ANSWERS TO SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US ACROSS THE STATE AND I NOTED IN TALKING TO PROBATION CHIEFS THERE ARE. SOME THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS SOME THAT ARE VERY WORRIED AND WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE MOST AYE I THINK IN TALKING THEM IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHORT CHANGED AND LEFT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE- THE USE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SERVE AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE TO SAFEGUARD WITH I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE NOTION THAT IF WE MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS. AND WE CREATE AN APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE NOW THE SAVINGS WILL CALM BUT IF WHAT WE DO TODAY IS SEEN MERELY FOR THE LAND. OF FISCAL GIVING THEN THIS IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE CITY AND THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO SLEEP TRYING TO IMPROVE. UNITY THAT THIS HAS TO BENEFIT OUR YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE BEST PATH FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE SITUATION THAT THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN. AND ULTIMATELY IF WE CAN BRING THEY- THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE PROBATION SYSTEM ALL OF THE SYSTEMS TOGETHER. AND DEAL WITH YOU. IN A WAY THAT THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO BARRIER TO ANYONE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES THEY NEED TAKE THE STIGMA AWAY FROM THE JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH AND JUST MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE PROVIDE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDE. THAT THE- FOR THAT THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WE ALTERNATELY NOT ONLY SAVE MONEY ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHICH IS IMPORTANT YES BUT WE SEE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF THAT AND YET FOR HOWEVER WE GET IN CONVERSATION. WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE KEEP ON TRACK WITH OUR ULTIMATE GOAL OF REDUCING OR SET OF. IN LIVES EVEN TO PROVIDE BENEFITS OUR YOUTH ACROSS. THANK THANK YOU STONE IS THERE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR OPENING. OKAY THAT BEING THE CASE I WANT TO THANK OUR MEMBERS FOR THEIR COMMENTS WILL NOW MOVE TO THE PANEL WE HAVE SOME OF. VERY INTERESTING AND EXCITING INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING TO US WE'RE HOPING AND WE'RE ASKING EACH PANELIST MET THEIR COMMENTS TO FIVE MINUTES AT THE MOST. YEAH BUT THE- SEVEN.

I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THIS YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION AND THE CENTER AT ZERO HELP. A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA FUND IS FOR BOYS IS NOT A COLOR. JUST SIXTEEN MEMBER OF PHILANTHROPIC TABLE INVESTING IN IMPROVING OUTCOMES SUPPORT THE MEN OF COLOR THE BAY YEAR OF LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION. I'M HERE THIS TO SHARE OUT THE- ABOUT MOVING CURRENT BJJ FUNDS TO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT. SHIFTING MONEY FROM ONE PUNITIVE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. BUT SUFFICIENT CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE STRATEGIES THEY WOULD EMPLOY. CHANCE THE GOALS OF THIS HISTORIC CHANGE. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WE ALREADY KNOW WORK BETTER FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I'M HERE TO EMPHASIZE THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH THE IMPORTANT TEST BEFORE. WHEN GOVERNOR'S SOME PERSONNEL CHIPPING THE VISION OF YOUR BUDGET TO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY. SAID TODAY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE IMPRISONMENT SYSTEM AS WE KNOW. THIS SIGNATURE PHRASE WAS ONE CHANGE AGENTS IN THE FIELD OF WAITED FIGURE FOR DECADES. WE KNOW JUVENILE JUSTICE SHOULD BE ABOUT HELPING TO THE MAT IN A PERSON WHO LIVES. NOT JUMP STARTING A REVOLVING DOOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. LONG TIME COMMUNITY ADVOCATES WERE HOPEFUL ABOUT THE COMMITMENT CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION FOR CALIFORNIA JUNE. THE GOVERNOR NOW PROPOSING A SHIFT THE FUNDING AND OVERSIGHT THE COUNTY. RECOLOGY APPROACHES CHANGE BUT BELIEVE DEEPLY THAT THE GOALS MONTHS NOT. THE NEW APPROACH MUST STILL BE SHAPED BY COMMITTED TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT NOT EXPEDIENT FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THE TRANSFORM A YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW WITH IN CALIFORNIA. DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN IN A GROWING MOVEMENT THAT TOPPLED SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BUILD APPLE PATHWAYS TO HELP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE ACCUMULATING THAT COULD BE SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THINK. YOU JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A POWERFUL AND IT'S HEARTENING VAMP. DEMONSTRATING RESULTS OF THIS INVESTMENT INSTITUTION. FOR DECADES. 93% OF YOUTH FOOTBALL WITH THE J. J. ARE YOU CALLING. AND EVEN IF CRIME RATES HAVE GONE DOWN ACROSS THE STATE AND NATIONAL. THE RACIAL DISPARITIES OF ON THE GROUND. WE NEED A PLAN THAT TRULY SERGIO. CRITICALLY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR BY INVESTING IN THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITY THE YOUNG PEOPLE THINK HEAL FROM TRAUMA TO BUILD OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE SUPPORTED. SIXTY GOING FORWARD THE PLAN MUST INCLUDE STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. CALIFORNIA WOULD REQUIRE EVIDENCE NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN EFFECTIVE STATE AND THE TEMPLATE THAT CAN PROVIDE OVERSIGHT THE BJP ALIGNMENT AND ENSURE RESOURCES ARE SPENT RESPONSIBLY. USE OUTCOME AND PUBLIC SECTOR. SUCH A TO SIX OF A COUNTY OPERATED NEW JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL BE INVESTMENTS IN REGARDS RIGOROUS DATA COLLECTION REPORTING AND STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT PINE AGENCY BIG THING YOU'VE HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND NOT SIMPLY BY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. OTHER STUDENTS THAN FICTION OR ENTITIES CLOSELY TIED TO THE CURRENT. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT UNIX OF. I'M A FORMER ALAMEDA COUNTY EIGHT TO FOR SOCIAL SERVICES A FORMER ALAMEDA COUNTY CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR I KNOW FROM MY PAST HISTORY THE STATE OF A SIMILAR PROCESS BEEN TRANSFORMATIVE CHILD WELFARE CALIFORNIA BY CENTRALIZING DATA COLLECTION IN THE STATE OVERSIGHT OF COMING TO LOOK AT SERVICE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BUT CHILDREN COUNTY. WE SHOULD PRIME MINISTER LET THE STAY IN. WHAT IT HAPPENED TO BEING MADE TO SUPPORT THIRTY. AND DEVELOPMENT TRY CAN ALSO HELP ENSURE EQUITABLE STATE FOR THE CAL WITH MAN TO PRIORITIZE MONEY TO COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES. AND NO FUNDING FOR ANY CONSTRUCTION OF STATE OR COUNTY SECURE EFFECTIVELY EXCEPT FOR WE PURPOSING EXISTING BUILDINGS AND ALIGNMENT WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH FOR YOUTH DEVELOPMENT FISHING. IN FACT STRIPPING THE DJ FUNDING ACCOUNT WITHOUT OVERSIGHT WOULD LIKELY DEEPENING EQUITY BY REINFORCING THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY. YOU'VE ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE IMPACT OF INEQUITABLE FUNDING AND RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED A CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS LIKE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD AFFORDABLE HOUSING QUALITY EDUCATION IN THE LONGEVITY OF A PERSON'S LIFE. AND THE QUALITY OF THAT LIFE. INSTEAD WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES REDUCED TO POCKETS IF YOU TRY THE BILL AND MAKE SURE YOU JUSTICE PROGRAM IS LIVING UP TO THE PROMISE. OF HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE SIXTY. WE NEED RESOURCES DEDICATED TO COMMUNITY BASED UP ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OF EVIDENCE BASED. RESEARCH IS CLEAR ABOUT THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF INCARCERATION AND OF THE POSITIVE IMPACT THE COMMUNITY FROM GRAHAM. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL PUBLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON JUVENILE JUSTICE IN THE U. S. INCLUDED THAT WELL DESIGNED COMMITTEE PROGRAMS OFF FOR MORE LIKELY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND IMPROVE YEAH WELL BEING BUT INSTITUTIONS GRAYSON WHICH IS BOTH COSTLY IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL TERMS AND- IN FOR OF GOAL PARKER. RESEARCHERS ALSO CLEAR ABOUT THE IMPACT THE BRAIN AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON BEHAVIORS THAT WE HAVE CRIMINALIZED PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH OF COLOR. IF WE CONTINUE THE LOCK ABOUT YOUR- CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNIZE THEM E NEED FOR CHANGE A RECENT PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA POLL SHOWED BROAD SUPPORT FOR EQUITY IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AT LEAST HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S OPPOSED TO STATE DIVERSE REGION AND RACIAL DEMOGRAPHICS VIEW THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS YOU RACIALLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THAT PERCENTAGE RISES THE SUPER MAJORITIES AMONG DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS. LUCKILY WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL MODELS TO TRUST THE COMMUNITY BROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE. WE GOT A LOT FROM RECENT GOVERNMENTAL ACTION SAN FRANCISCO AND LA TO SHIFT FUNDING FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY RELEVANT RESTORED OF COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDED. BY THE BY THE BASE OF THE STATE'S. AND STEP BY WITH. LIVE NEXT. WE SELECT DO YOU STATE START. GALLAGHER MOVING CALIFORNIA FORWARD FOR THE YOUTH JUSTICE TRANSFORMATION VISION IN THE GOVERNMENT STATEMENT I QUOTED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS. CALIFORNIA MUST NOT GO BACK WHICH- ACCOUNT IS A MOVING IF THEY FOR. HOPEFULLY THIS ABOUT OUR VALUES OF THE STATE. I APPRECIATE YOU CHAIR WEBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MISS JENNIFER CAMP FOR THE PARTICIPANT HOLDING THESE VALUES WOULD BE J. REALIGNMENT. WE MUST REDUCE THE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AN OPPORTUNITY OUTCOMES ABOUT BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN. EVERY CHILD DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY EVERY CHILD HAS THE SAME CHANCES FOR HEALING REHABILITATION AN OPPORTUNITY. I URGE YOU URGE US ALL TO MAKE THE GOOD TROUBLE. FIVE EQUITIES JUVENILE JUSTICE REACHING YOU IN CALIFORNIA WITH THAT BUT YOU'RE WEBER I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER HEWITT TO CREATE THOSE COMMENTS AND YOUR WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR SO LONG I WANT TO OUR NEXT PERSON IS CHIEF BRIAN **** WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RIGHT RICHARD G. PROBATION OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY OF ELDORADO. AND PRESIDENT OF THE G. PROBATION OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION COURSE OFFERING MARKS ON THE WALLS OF FOR THE NEXT REALIGNMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AGAIN BY REFERENCE GENE- SHE PARKS POSITION ON THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT PROPOSAL WHICH IS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. WE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED OPPOSITION AFTER SUBSTANTIVE FOR YOU AND WHAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED TO US. WERE VARIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND POTENTIAL WITH HIS PROPOSED. I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN OUR CONCERNS DETAILED IN A LETTER SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. DIDN'T IN HERE PRECEDING MY TESTIMONY TODAY YOU'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO HOW OTHERS WOULD SUGGEST- DJJ BE REPLACED- SHE PARKS READY TO CONTINUE AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS ON THE BROADER POLICY ISSUES AS WELL AS THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT YOU CAN OUTLINED HERE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS MANY OF YOU KNOW PROVISION SHEETS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF MANY OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORMS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A ONE. YOU'RE GOING JUSTICE REALIGNMENT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE REALIGNMENT OF JUVENILE PAROLE. AND OTHER BROWN'S PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHICH SHE PARKS SUPPORTED. AND THROUGH WHICH WE ACHIEVE THE RESULTS ARE RETURNING THE AUTHORITY OF JUVENILE TRANSFERS TO CRIMINAL COURT. BACK WITH JUDGES RATHER THAN THE PROSECUTORS. HERE'S AGO WHEN THIS ONE OF TO REDUCE NUMBER OF U. THIRTY. AFTER PROGRAM AT LOCAL LEVEL. THEY LOOK THE PART WITH PROBATION AND FUNDED SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY BUILDING LOCAL CAPACITY. WHICH CREATED OPTIONS FOR COURTS TO CONSIDER WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR YOU. THE RESULT WAS A MASSIVE REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION CITYJET JACK. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL PROBATION TO RETURN HEALTHCARE YOU BACK TO THE COMMUNITY OR TIMELY MANNER BUT THE SPORTS BUT HE- CORNERSTONE CALL. IN THAT RELY LIST THE BAY CAN. AND BUILD CAPACITY WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FORGET. THE BREAD MORE EQUITABLE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH A CHILD. AND IT'S CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT EVEN THOUGH PREVIOUS REALIGNMENTS ESSENTIALLY REDUCED WHAT SOME CRITICS SAW AS A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM. WE DIDN'T SEE A RISING CRIME WE DIDN'T SEE A RISE IN LOCAL CAR SERRATION EFFECT WITHOUT THE OPPOSITE. LOCAL PROGRAMS WORK AND KEEPING KIDS LOCAL HAS BEEN A HALLMARK TO THE SUCCESS OF KEEPING KIDS FROM PENETRATING DEEPER INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE ADULT PURPOSES SYSTEM. IN FACT GIVEN THE TEN RATES OF FALLEN BY SIXTY PER. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TODAY. 90% OF THE YOUTH REFERRED TO OUR CARE ARE SAFELY AND SUCCESSFULLY SERVED DIRECTLY IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THOSE NUMBERS DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY VIEW CAREER FOR PROBATION. AND WHO WE DIVERT AWAY FROM OUR OWN SYSTEM ALTOGETHER. WE HAVE A FORMULA THAT WORKS AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE GAINES AND BEEN MADE OVER THE LAST DECADE. WE CAN JUST CHANGE. BASS OF KIDS FROM DJ. YEAH WITH THE OF. AT A LOCAL LEVEL WE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFORMED JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE DATA IS CLEAR AS THE FACTION SEE POCKET IS A DATA DRIVEN ORGANIZATION WHAT WE TAKE A POSITION IT'S BASED ON NOT ON CONJECTURE OR POLITICS IT'S BASED ON WHAT'S KNOWN. AND WHAT CAN REASONABLY BE FORECASTED BY WHAT IS NOW. BY RELYING ON EVIDENCE SCIENCE AND DATA TO DRIVE DECISION MAKING PROBATION WAS ABLE ARCHER AND USE OF A SMARTER. SAFER AND MORE COMPASSIONATE WAY TO WORK WITH YOU AND JUSTICE. WE CHANGE THE CULTURE. IN PROBATION. INSTAR COMMITMENT TO PRIORITIZE THE SERVICE TO YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND OUR HOLISTIC APPROACHES MAINTAIN COMMUNITY SAFETY. WITHOUT ABILITY IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY KEYS FOR SUCCESS WITH THE COMPASSION WAS ANOTHER REMAINING FOCUSED ON NEEDS FOR A INFORMED LENS HELPS FOSTER THAT COMPASSION. WE PROVIDE EXTENSIVE TRAINING FOR OFFICERS TO WORK WITH YOU MORE EFFECTIVELY AND COMPASSIONATELY AND USING AN EVENT SPACE FOR AND WORK TOWARD REHABILITATION HELPS KEEP YOU FOCUSED ON HEALTHY PATHWAYS. BUT BECAUSE WE EVIDENCE. ENGAGEMENT WEEK. IN THIS DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE EIGHT HUNDRED OR SO THINK THE JJ. WE WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO DISCUSS WHAT ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YOU. CAN BENEFIT FROM SHE TALKED PROPOSAL PROPOSED THE RAISE THE AGE OF JUVENILE COURT JURISDICTION. A PLAN WHICH INCLUDES THE BROADER IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WORKS TO ADDRESS RACIAL INEQUITIES IN THOSE YOUTH CENTER PROBATION. PROBATION OPERATES ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. CHANGES OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND WE SUBJECT OURSELVES TO THAT FRAME WORKERS WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN SHE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS BRAIN BREAKING WITH THE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH STATES AND USING THAT TO GUIDE OUR EFFORTS TO FURTHER. EVOLVE ARE OBSESSED. WHEN WE MADE. A COUPLE OF A- WE RELIED ON THE- OF RESEARCH ADULT BRAIN SCIENCE THE EIGHT AND NINETEEN YEAR OLDS ARE. MAY CRASH DECISIONS THAT IGNORE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES FOCUSING RATHER ON IMMEDIATE GAINS. BREAKING NEWS JOURNAL COURT JURISDICTION FROM SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN CORPORATE WHAT RESEARCH TELLS US IS COMMONSENSE ARE MERGING DOGS ARE MORE AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION BECAUSE THEIR BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING AND THEREFORE CAN INCORPORATE ADOPT NEW WAYS OF THINKING WE GET A LASTING CHANGE. TO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT PROGRAM CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY MANAGEMENT HARPER KENNEDY SCHOOL NOTES THAT A MERGING OF DOGS COMPRISE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ARRESTS IN THE U. S. EMERGING ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MAKE UP TEN PERCENT. OF THE US POPULATION BUT 30% OF THE REST. FOR THOSE OF US WITH OLDER TEENS IN OUR LIVES THAT'S NO MYSTERY WE SEE PLAY OUT REGULARLY IN THE DECISIONS THAT MAKE. THE SAME STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAIN VIGILANT JUSTICE SYSTEM RATHER THAN BEING PROSECUTED THE ADULT SYSTEM. ARE UP 277% LESS LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED BURKE BY. THOSE PROSECUTED AS ADULTS WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE REARRESTED FOR MORE VIOLENT CRIME THAN THOSE LOS. IN OUR VIEW REYES IN A JURISDICTION WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS NEED OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A CHOICE. BUT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER OUR PROPOSAL DOESN'T STOP THERE. IN ADDITION TO PROPOSING TO RAISE THE JURISDICTION WE SHOULD DEPARTMENT SEVERAL BEST PRACTICES ACROSS OUR STATE BY ALIGNING OUR APPROACHES IN CODE. TO SERVE YOU. TO THE LEVEL OF NEED AND RISK WHILE STILL LEVERAGING THE FLEXIBILITY ANDINNOVATION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO OBTAIN THAT STANDARDS. OF COURSE A CONVERSATION TODAY THIS SURROUNDING REWRITING YOU THE DJJ CALIBRATION APARTMENTS. AND PROBATION CHIEFS IN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S WOULD BEAT ARE PREPARED TO HELP THE STATE SHAPE. WHAT IS NEEDED TO REALIGN DJJ COUNTY PROBATION MUCH LIKE WE'VE DONE IN PREVIOUS REALIGNMENTS. WE SHOULD RELY ON THE SUCCESSFUL BUT TO GUIDE EFFORTS GOING. WE KNOW BY WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS. FROM THE BUS. IT MUST INSTALL COMPANY IN OUR JOB SYSTEM PARTNERS THAT CAN ABILITY. AND REHABILITATION OUR ALL A- WITH THE MAKAN OF THE NEW MODEL. ABSENT THAT NO AMOUNT OF DISINCENTIVES WILL PERSUADE THEM FROM PURSUING A COURSE OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE PUBLIC SAFETY OVER WHAT WE KNOW TO BE BEST FOR YOU. GAINS WE HAVE MADE OVER THE LAST DECADE MUST NOT BE MARKED. BY COULD FORMS FOR THIS IF AND EFFECTIVE DATES ARE MET ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED NEEDS TO BE COURT FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED MUCH SERIOUS OFFENSES. PROBATION CAN AGAIN HELP THE STATE EFFECTUATE SIGNIFICANT MEANINGFUL CHANGE HOWEVER WE MUST FOCUS ON A FEW THINGS. WE MUST BE ABLE TO TAILOR PROGRAMS SERVICES AND CAPACITY AND DELIVER A MESSAGE TO THE EACH EACH YEAR AT BEST SIR. DON'T RESTRUCTURE THE PLAN REPLACEMENT. IT WITH ANOTHER SHIP STANDARDS COLLECT DATA AND INCENTIVIZE BEST PROPER SHOES. THE BUILDING OF THE ROCKER HAS NEVER HELPED HILL CHILD. TRAUMA AS WE CANNOT. OR IN YOUR BURKE MAKE SCENARIO WHEREBY THE RELY OF DJ. ARMS ARE. WITH NINETY PER OF THE JUNE SYSTEM THAT ITS CURRENT MANAGED LOCAL. SCHOOL SUPPORT MUCH BE STABLE AND SECURE. BY WRAP UP BY SAME PROBATION AS HAVE WITH MANY PER REFORM STAND ABOUT WITH THIS CA AND THE ADMIN TO ACTUATE THE RECLINER OF DJS COUNTY IN A WAY THAT IT'S ARE GOALS WE'LL WORK HARD INVESTED IN TRAINING TO CREATE MORE HEALTH FOCUSED COMMON FORMED TO COMPASSIONATE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT DIVERTS THE MAJORITY YOU. AND TREATS THOSE WITH HIGH NEEDS WITH AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH. I AM VERY HEARTENED TO HEAR THE COMMENTS FROM- SHAKERS BEFORE ME ARE SO MUCH IN ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE OF OUR OWN AND- WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO FOR RECHARGE WHERE THEY ARE PRESENTER IS CHIEF TONYA HARTMAN WHO IS FOR THE SOUTH REGION CHAIR AND LEGISLATIVE VICE CHAIR OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING CHAIR WEBER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM TONYA HEISMAN CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER FOR SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND SEE POP SOUTHERN REVENGE REGION CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR OF A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PART OF THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. OUR APPROACH TO REALIGNMENT IS INFORMED BY THE ELEVATE JUSTICE ACT CONTAINED IN SENATE BILL EIGHT EIGHT NINE. BEYOND RAISING THE AGE OF JURISDICTION TO FOLLOW BRAIN SCIENCE WE'RE SEEKING TO CODIFY BEST PRACTICES TO MORE FULLY SET STANDARDS THAT ALIGN APPROACHES IN LAW TO BETTER SERVE YOU. THESE INCLUDE TO LIMIT CONDITIONS OF PROBATION IMPOSED BY THE COURT TO ONLY THOSE FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THE RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIED THROUGH A RESEARCH BASED RISK ASSESSMENT. TO ADOPT INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION PLANS THAT OUR FAMILY CENTERED STRENGTH BASED AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY BUILT AROUND INCENTIVES AND REWARDS RATHER THAN SANCTIONS. TO FURTHER REDUCE DETENTION CONDITION IT ON A RESEARCH BASED RISK ASSESSMENT AND THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND URGENT SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ENSURING FOR REQUIRING THE USE. OF A RESPONSE MATRIX FOR YOUTH ON PROBATION TO BETTER INFORM THOSE CRUCIAL DETENTION DECISIONS THAT CAN HAVE SUCH LASTING CONSEQUENCES. AND INCLUDE AS PART OF THE WORK OF EACH COUNTY'S JUVENILE JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL AND EXAMINATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF RACIAL ETHNIC GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISPARITIES. AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES IDENTIFIED. ALONG WITH MOVING AWAY FROM THE UTILIZATION OF OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS AND BUILDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO SERVE THOSE VIEWS WITH ACUTE TREATMENT NEEDS SB EIGHT EIGHT NINE WOULD GO FAR IN ACHIEVING GREATER SUCCESS AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. OVERSIGHT IS IMPORTANT WE AGREE THE STATE SHOULD MONITOR SUPPORT AND DEMAND OUTCOMES. PURSUANT TO STATUTE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY OVERSEEN BY THE JUVENILE PRESIDING JUDGE THE GRAND JURY THE DELINQUENCY PREVENTION COUNCIL THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES AND PERSPECTIVES WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED ADDITIONAL ENTITIES AND REVIEWING OUR OPERATIONS BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW. WE SEEK OUT THE MOST EXPERIENCED KNOWLEDGEABLE EXPERTS WHILE ENSURING THEIR WORK IS ALIGNED WITH OUR VALUES AND FOCUS ON POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. MANY PURSUE ACCREDITATION FROM ENTITIES SUCH AS THE INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL QUALITY R. I. M. Q. THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE. PERFORMANCE BASED STANDARDS AS WELL AS COUNTLESS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS THAT REVIEW OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THE QUALITY OF OUR CARE. WE ALSO WELCOME VOLUNTEERS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS INTO OUR FACILITIES EACH DAY TO PARTNER WITH US AND STRENGTHEN OUR EFFORTS. I'M PROUD OF THE COUNTRY'S TRANSFORMATION THAT HAS OCCURRED SINCE I FIRST ENTERED THIS BILL THIRTY YEARS AGO. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERY USE THAT AS AN OUR CARE. AND AS A MOTHER I FEEL A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERY MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AUNTS OR OTHER LOVED ONES WITH THE CHILD AT ONE OF MY FACILITIES. IT NEEDS TO BE IF YOU PATH AND THE TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE BEEN DORT CANNOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST ANOTHER FAILED SYSTEM BUT THEY WILL CYCLE THROUGH. THE DJJ POPULATION HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK AND NEEDS AND WILL REQUIRE NOTHING SHORT OF OUR BEST RESEARCH DATA EXPERTISE AND COMMITMENT. AS EXPERTS IN JUVENILE JUSTICE WE NOTE INEQUALITY IN SERVICES CAN ARISE FOR YOU. WE MUST BE COGNIZANT OF THE GAPS IN CAPACITY. NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE CAPACITY AND SOME THAT DO MAY NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CAPACITY. WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE TREATMENT MODALITY AS WELL AS THE SPACE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SAFETY NEEDS OF THE U. WE DESPERATELY NEED SPACE SPACE. THAT CAN BE USED TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS THAT REDUCE STRESS NOT ADD TO IT. WE'RE PROUD OF THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION DETENTION ACHIEVED IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO LOOK AT INCENTIVISING COLLABORATION WITHOUT BUILDING IN LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY AND PUTTING UP SILOS SILOS THAT WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY HARM THE YOUTH WERE TRYING TO HELP. WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IMPORTANT WORK OF DIVERSION AND QUALITY COMMUNITY SUPERVISION SO THAT WE DO NOT JEOPARDIZE THOSE SEPARATE WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN THE TO PROVIDE POPULATION AS WELL AS DECREASED ATTENTION. WITH PROPER INVESTMENT SUPPORTS PROBATION CAN SUCCESSFULLY INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL USE AND MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE AND SUPPORTIVE LOCAL JUVENILE CONTINUE ON. BUT WE CANNOT RISK THE REFORM EFFORT THAT WILL RESULT IN MORE USED IN THE ADULT SYSTEM. THIS PLAN MUST GIVE CONFIDENCE TO COURTS AND OTHERS THAT THE JUVENILE SYSTEM CAN ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION. IF WE DO NOT INSURE THIS CONFIDENCE WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN ADULT FILENE'S AND GREATLY SET BACK THE PROGRESS MADE SO RECENTLY. IN CLOSING AS I VISIT. OUR FACILITIES TO SIT AND TALK TO THE USED IN ART. AFTER THE LEASE TRUST UNIT IN A SPACE THAT HAS BEEN RECONFIGURED TO SERVE LIKE A FAMILY ROOM IN SOMEONE'S HOME. RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL DAY ROOM. I REMINDED THAT WHILE THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. AND I WATCHED THE YOUTH IN OUR CARE SHARE THEIR ARTWORK ORANGE OR A AN OLD FASHIONED WATER BALLOON FIGHT ON A HOT DAY. I'M REMINDED WHY WE WORK SO HARD TO ALLOW THEM TO BE CHILDREN. IF DONE WELL THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO MUCH MORE TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WHILE KEEPING OUR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PROBATION CHIEFS ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE BETTER OPTIONS FOR ALL YOU KNOW JUSTICE SYSTEM. THANK YOU AGAIN AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY WANT TO THANK. CHIEF OF HEIGHTS MEANT THAT'S THE THIS IS THE LAST OF OUR A PANELIST TO PRESENT INFORMATION TO US I WANT TO ASK OF THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR LA- THEY'RE ON STANDBY IF ANY THAT FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE THEIR HERE AVAILABLE FOR US IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS NOW WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THOSE IF THEY'D LIKE TO ADD SOME OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE ON STANDBY FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE. IS ANYONE IN LA- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE IT THIS TIME. AND THIS IS AMY JARVIS AND I WOULD APPRECIATE JUST A COUPLE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. AND THAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE PROPOSAL NOW AND THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING. THAT CHEAP PROBATION OFFICERS AS WELL AS ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I THINK THEIR PIECES WERE WHERE WE CAN PROBABLY REACH AGREEMENT I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WERE STILL. AND WE STILL WANT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE ALL OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE BY ALL THE PANELISTS- AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE ARE. MANY AREAS WHERE WE HAVE COMMON GROUND. I AM I THINK A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANTED TO THE SITE AS- SOME. MORE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IS THE TINY I'M AND WHILE I AGREE THE INTENT IS NOT JUST TO ADDRESS A PHYSICAL SITUATION. IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE RIGHT POLICY WE DO THINK THESE YOU CAN BE SERVED BETTER IF THEY REMAIN LOCAL. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO RETAIN. I'M TERMS THE TIMING AND THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS- COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND ARE SORT OF IN A WAIT AND INTAKE AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THEN SLOW ATTRITION OVER TIME. I THINK WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TINY AGAIN WELL IT'S NOT FISCALLY DRIVEN THERE ARE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF DOING THAT. AND WE ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY. THAT WE- THAT. TO AND I. IT'S THAT YOU. HAVE SIDE TODAY. I'M THEY HAVE ME GREAT REST LOCALLY. AND HOT ACHIEVE REALLY GREAT OUTCOME AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT MOMENTUM I'M- FOR THE- POPULATION IT REMAINS TO THE STATE. I THINK. THE OTHER THING THEY I. LIKE TO CONTINUE TO. IS CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT. WITH HELP SERVICES AGENCY. I'M THE ROLE OF THE BOARD IT STINKS. SINCE THE PLOT POINT. I'M AYE AND IS IT BAD THAT. CONTEMPLATED IT HARPER. SOMETHING THAT WE DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT FOR I THINK WE ARE OPEN TO AND I OF YOUTH ADVOCATE OFFICE AND OR SOME AN AUTUMN MEN TYPE POSITION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN PROBABLY FIND SOME COMMON GROUND- I THINK ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE FOR US IS HAVING IN- OPTIONS FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THOSE THAT EXISTS NOW SO THAT WE DON'T ENCOURAGE. MORE ADULT COURT COMMITMENTS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THEM IS KEY O OUR PROPOSAL ALL ALONG- WE STARTED WHEN WE PROPOSED MADE THE PROPOSAL. AT A COST OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE THAT WOULD BE REALIGNED TO THE LOCALS AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND WE INCREASED THAT TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUTH. WITH A FLOOR OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTIES THAT HAD- THAT WAS LOWER THAN WHATEVER THAT I HAD MATH AND THAT BE. I'D SO I WANTED TO KNOW THAT I THINK AND THERE IS ALSO A COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE COST OF OUR INCARCERATION AT THE STATE LEVEL. OUR PER CAPITA COST IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS COMING YEAR AND I THINK LOCALLY THOSE THERE ARE SOME VERY BIG VARIATIONS I THINK ON THE HIGH END SANTA CLARA IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU. OTHER KEY SMALL COUNTIES ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. LA IS CLOSER TO AROUND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SO I'M NOT I'M NOT JUSTIFYING OUR COSTS BUT I DO THINK WE DO HAVE VERY. SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT WHICH WE ARE NOW NO LONGER SUBJECT TO BUT HAVE AGREED VARIOUS. RELATIONS AND WE HOUSE ARE YOU. CONSISTENT WITH THOSE AGREEMENTS I AND WE PROVIDE THE TREATMENT SERVICES CONSISTENT WITHOUT LAWSUIT SO. I DID JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS RECOGNIZING THAT NOT ALL COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPLICATE. OR AND OPERATE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE- THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE STATE LEVEL SYSTEM LIKE THE SEX BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER. WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR COUNTIES TO CREATE THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHY WE ALSO ESTABLISHED. SOME PLANNING MONEY WITHIN- THE BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES FOR THAT FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. I'M IN OUR INTENT WOULD BE TO OVERTIME DEVELOP THOSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES LOCALLY RECOGNIZING THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO EXIST IN EACH COUNTY WE THOUGHT OUR REGIONAL APPROACH. WOULD WORK AND THAT HAPPENS NOW OUR CAPPIES THE CONTRACT OTHER. TONY FOR PRESIDENT GRANT WAS. UP THEY I JUST A JUVENILE HALL FIRST BT THERE ARE SERVICE AND FOR. IN THE CAN. I MUCH OF THOSE THAT WERE TO BY THE ADVOCATES EARLIER AND- IN THIS HEARING. SO THOSE ARE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD CONTINUE UNDER THIS MODEL OUR INTENT IS NOT TO BREAK THAT. BUT OUR INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN LOCAL DISCRETION WHILE ALSO- INSURING CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM. FOR THOSE JUDGES THAT MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT HOUSING OF THESE JUVENILE OFFENDERS. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I HADN'T WANTED TO COVER HERE AND I YES THAT DOUBLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE FROM THE L. A. O. WHO HAS ANY COMMENTS THAT THEY LIKE TO MAKE THIS TIME. MAKE IT TOMORROW HELLO I WOULD JUST NOTE A FEW. CONCERNS RAISED BY THE A RT ALSO A- IN THE LUNCH. PROPOSAL SO ON THAT TIME. WHILE THE LET'S TAKE A PROPOSAL DELAY THE- STOPPAGE OF AND TAKEN TOLD TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR. COUNTIES TO BRING YOU BACK TO THE COUNTIES EARLIER- AND- DO YOU SEE THE FISCAL INCENTIVE TO DO SO. AND THEN. IN TERMS OF YOU BEING SENT TO POTENTIALLY BEING SENT TO ADULT COURT THAT ALLEGED PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY INCLUDE A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE FOR COUNTIES TO THANK YOU TO ADULT COURT BECAUSE THOSE WHO WOULD BE SENTENCED TO PRISON- COUNTY WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FIFTY DOLLARS MARGINAL COST FOR THE FULL DURATION OF THE PRISON TERM. IT FISSION IN TERMS OF THE REGIONAL APPROACH THAT WILL TAKE CHARGE APPROACH DOES ALSO INCLUDE OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES TO CONTRACT WITH EACH OTHER TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND ALSO WORD OF ESTABLISH A REGIONAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR COUNTIES TO DEVELOP HUBS FOR MORE SPECIALIZED SERVICES WHICH WOULD BE OFFERED. ORIGINALLY NOT JUST TO WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT BRINGS IT BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE OR THE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS YES WAS JUST DON'T. SO A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION TO. HINGES ON SOMETHING THAT REALLY HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED TO THESE PROPOSALS AND THAT'S FACILITIES. BECAUSE IF COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE TAKING ON OR- FORGIVE YOU LOOKING TO COUNTIES TO BE PROVIDING SOME REGIONAL. SUPPORT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE RIGHT FACILITIES AND A AND A LIKE THIS NOTION OF NOT JUST CAPACITY BUT APPROPRIATE CAPACITY. BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL CAPACITY AT THE COUNTIES TO. BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE HALF OR OR LESS FULL BUT THOSE FACILITIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE IF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS. THE RIGHT KIND OF PROGRAMMING AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS THE NEED. TO UPDATE SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES AND NOT JUST PARKING FACILITIES BUT ACTUALLY SOFTENING. FACILITY SO THAT THEY CAN BE MORE HOME LIKE THAT THEY CAN BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE KINDS OF PROGRAMMING. THAT THESE THESE YOUTH REALLY NEED SO FORGET HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM I THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF FACILITIES NEEDS IN IN JUST FOR EXAMPLE CARRY THAT I COME OUT OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. UNDER THE OLD C. Y. EIGHT DAYS CAN YOU REFUSE TO SEND KIDS TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD THINGS WERE. INSTEAD OF THE SAME TYPE AND WORKED VERY HARD TO DIVERT KIDS SO THEY HAD A VERY SMALL POPULATION. AT THE JUVENILE HALL AND BECAUSE OF THAT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR FUNDING THEY WERE ABLE TO GET FUNDING TO UPDATE THEIR FACILITIES SO THERE A LOT OF COUNTIES HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT THE RIGHT THING. OVER THE- INTERVENING YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF HOW THE CAPACITY LOOKS IN AND PREVIOUS FUNDING DECISIONS THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO SERVE KIDS SO I THINK WE NEED TO AS IN PARALLEL. WITH THE EFFORT OF THIS REALIGNMENT IS REALLY LOOK AT THE CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE THE KINDS OF FACILITIES THAT ARE THERE AND SEE IF WE NEED TO BE PROVIDING SOME UPDATES. TO THOSE CABINETS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEED TO BE SPENT UP TO PROVIDE REGIONAL SERVICES AS WE MOVE FOR WOOD WITH. THIS PROPOSAL SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESSED HERE. SO AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. IN PARALLEL TO THIS IS REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE CAPACITY IS AT EACH COUNTY INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL BEDS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MORE KIDS. THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THOSE COUNTIES WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN FORGET EXPECT THAT REGIONAL APPROACH TO WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE COUNTY IS WILLING TO STEP UP. FOR THOSE REGIONAL SERVICES AND HELP COUNTIES AROUND THE- YEAH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. JONES SAWYER YES AND THANK YOU OUT OF IT AND I HEARD HEARD A LOT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF THE SYSTEMS WERE WORKING- ACCOUNTABILITY WHETHER ON. ON THE PROVISION SIDE OR OR THE STATE SIDE ORDINATE COMMITTEE BASE ORGANIZATIONS SITE UP WE WOULD BE MEETING HERE RIGHT NOW. IF THERE WERE IF PEOPLE HAVEN'T TRULY BEEN ACCOUNTABLE AND THE SUCCESS. AND SO I I'M I'M ALWAYS WONDERING WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. AND I USUALLY USED TO THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE OF- WORKING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE GET REALLY PRIDEFUL ON WHAT WE CALL WHICH IT SAID. WE GAVE THIS PROGRAM WE GET THAT PART READING PROGRAMS IN THE CLASSIC TIGHTEST SOCIAL WORKED ALL THIS WILL BE AT THE FRONT END. AND THEN WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR OUTCOMES YOU GET THIS KINDA MUMBLES- THE- MUMBLE JUMBLE AND I JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A CAR COMPANY. THAT DID A LOT OF RESEARCH PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT ON DISCARDED THEY WERE IN SELF TO LATINO COMMUNITY. AND IT WORKED REALLY GREAT AND THE IN A POLLING AND EVERYTHING THEN THEY PUT IT OUT INTO MARKET. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE CARD DIDN'T SELL. DISK LATINA JUST WOULD NOT BY THE CAR. AND ONE DAY THEY WERE TALKING TO SOMEONE IN ELECTION OR IN UPPER MANAGEMENT AND HE SAID WELL THE CAR'S NAME IS NOVA. IN IN IN IN SPANISH NOVA MEANS DON'T GO. WHY WOULD YOU WANNA CARDUS SAYS WON'T RUN WON'T GO. AND IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE DO ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE FRONT END AND THEN WHEN YOU ASK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE BACK IN- YOU DON'T GET A WHOLE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS SO AND SO WHEN I WHEN SOMEONE SAYS WE SPENT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR KIDS A THREE HUNDRED TO SEVENTY FIVE OR WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS I NEED TO TAXPAYERS. TO KNOW. WHAT BANG FOR THE BUCK DID THEY GET. AND SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW- FOR BOTH SIDES REALLY. DID YOU SET UP ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES RESET THE OUTCOMES THESE WERE THESE ARE GOALS THESE ARE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND IN THE OUTCOMES ARE GOING TO BE A. B. C. INDEED IF YOU DON'T REACH THOSE. DO YOU MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR BUDGET MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR PROGRAM DO YOU MAKE IT JUST. OR DO YOU JUST TO KEEP DOING THAT AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. OF WHAT WE CALL PEOPLE WHO DO THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT REALLY REALLY DRIVES ME CRAZY I DO NOT I'M NOT FIGHTING OVER. WHO GETS THE MONEY UP FIGHTING OVER WHO BEST. GET THE MONEY. IT 1100% OF IT WENT TO PROBATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY DID A- THEY DID THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE INTERESSES MINIMUM RATE WAS DOWN ALMOST TO ZERO. THEN WE NEED TO GIVE EVERY DIME TO THEM. BUT IF IT ISN'T IF IT IS THE CBO'S AND THEY'RE DOING THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE DO WE NEED TO GIVE IT TO THEM OR IS IT A HYBRID OF THAT. AND IT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE SUCCESS RATE OF THEIR- KIDS. NOT ON PEOPLE BUILDING AS SOMEONE SAID BUILDING BUREAUCRACIES ARE BUILDING NEW BUREAUCRACIES. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. I CAN BACK INTO WHAT MEASURES OF SUCCESS. ARE THEY USING. WHEN IT FROM. BOTH SIDES- OUT TO COMMUNITY OR WITHIN- WITHIN WITHIN GOVERNMENT. WHAT ARE THOSE MEASURES OF SUCCESS BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF THAT. IN ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL THING. ANYONE ELSE SEVENTY QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I THINK YOU RAISE SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES EVERYONE HAS RAISED SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES AND- AND AS WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBERS GO FROM TEN THOUSAND DOWN TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND- YOU KNOW WE CAN. PROBABLY STAND UP AND TAKE A BOW WE THINK WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO REALIZE THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES THAT BROUGHT US TO THAT EIGHT HUNDRED THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE DEVELOPED SUCH A GREAT SYSTEM TO REDUCE IT TO THAT LEVEL THAT WHAT NUMBER OF ALL- CHALLENGES AND OVERSIGHTS AND YOU KNOW LEGAL THINGS AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT MADE US AND AS WE DO EVEN WITH OUR- OWN OF PRISON SYSTEM THAT WE'VE- HAD REDUCE NUMBERS. YOU KNOW AND THAT KIND OF THING AND SELF SO THAT BRINGS US TO THAT BIG CONCERN I THINK WE HAVE SEEN- AND I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE SEEN AS AS I SAW HERE THE NUMBERS THE TREMENDOUS DISPARITY BETWEEN. THE COST THAT'S THERE AND I THINK THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE COST- YOU KNOW- WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED OF WODEHOUSE FIRST ON THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THE COST WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PER CHILD. NOW IT TOO CLOSE TO SOMEONE SAID FOUR HUNDRED AND MUCH OF IT HAS NOT AND MOST OF IT IS NOT TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE INCREASED SERVICES AND OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WE ARE FUNDING THESE FACILITIES- AND THESE- INSTITUTIONS OF THESE BUILDINGS AND THE STAFF THAT'S THERE. AND YET WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY INCREASING THE SERVICES AS WE IS ONE WOULD THINK AND SELL- SO THAT THAT HAD ME SOMEWHAT CONCERNED BECAUSE I FELT IT TWO AND A FIFTY THOUSAND I COULD PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB WITH HELPING FAMILIES AT PROVIDING STABILITY IN COUNSELING FOR THE FAMILY SO THE KIDS COULD BE BETTER OFF SERVING. AND THAT'S IT I'M GOING ON GOAL WHICH WILL CHANGE THE SENATE WE ARE. RECOGNIZE THE CAR OF. WHEN I WOULD GET WHAT WE WERE GOING. TO HAVE THE T RESOURCES THAT AND THAT AND THAT BECOMES. UP SOME OF THE CHEESE MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE WE HAVE SOME FOR THAT SOME REAL REALLY LOW I KNOW IT I AM IS AND IN ELDER. THERE'S A THREE P. AND IN THE YOUTH IN THE DO HALL AND THEY'VE BUILT A NEW FACILITY AND I'M WONDERING IF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ARE WE PREPARING FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF- SERVICE CENTER OR DELIVERY CENTER OR WHAT THAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR WITH OPENS A LOT OF A JUVENILE HALLS OF PRETTY EMPTY- AT THIS POINT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT WE ARE WE PREPARING I HOPE WE'RE NOT PREPARING TO FILL THE THAT'S NOT ONE. BECAUSE I SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THEY WILL COME THEY WILL BUILD IT THEY WILL FILL IT BUT ARE WE PREPARING OUR ADJUSTING THOSE OF WHO ARE A POLICE CHIEF OF THAT OUR OF PROBATION CHIEFS ARE WE ARE WE PREPARING TO RENOVATE. FACILITIES TO MAKE MORE. USEFUL APPROACH. FOR OF THIS. ARE WOULD DEALING. OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE DEAL OUR WE JUST. YOU KNOW I I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE THIS I KNOW WE SHUT DOWN SOME FACILITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE OF WITH. THE CAPACITY WASN'T THERE AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT. IF THEY SHUT DOWN THE RIGHT ONES ARE NOT BUT- ARE WE- I WHAT ARE WE PREPARING TO DO WITH THE SITUATION OF HAVING. THESE FACILITIES- AS MR STONE TALKS ABOUT. APPROPRIATE FACILITIES. ARE THE ONES WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE ONES ARE WE DOING THINGS WITH THEM. BEFORE WE GO OFF ON. A DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT. INCREASE THE OF THE COST OF GETTING NEW FACILITIES OR DIFFERENT KINDS OF THE SALUKIS AT ANY OF THE CHIEFS ABLE TO. PROBATION CHIEFS ABLE TO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH FACILITIES. SINCE WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE- BILL THE LOW NUMBER OF FOLKS IN THOSE FACILITIES IN THE VARIOUS. AREAS IS ANYONE WHO'S ON THE WORK ON THE ON THE LINE ANYONE OF OUR PROBATION CHIEFS HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON FACILITIES. YES MANAGER DESCRIBED RICHARD. ELDORADO COUNTY PROBATION CHIEF. AND WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT THE WILD WILD CALLED CORRECT THE RECORD JUST A LITTLE BIT- ARE AVERAGING POPULATIONS BETWEEN TWELVE AND FOURTEEN THE EPISODE A BUILT FOR FORTY- WE ACTUALLY RECENTLY CLOSED A FACILITY WE HAD AN EIGHTY BED CAPACITY. FACILITIES ELDORADO BUT- THE ECONOMICS OBVIOUSLY- DID NOT BEAR OUT SO EVEN THOUGH IT SERVED OPPOSITE ENDS OF OUR- WIDE COUNTY WE SHOT THAT WHATEVER TO FACILITIES ABOUT. A YEAR AND A HALF AGO- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. CONSTRUCTING A NEW TWENTY BED FACILITY TO REPLACE ALL OF OUR CAPACITY- WITH A- WITH A CONTEMPORARY. STYLE OF FACILITY WE'VE GONE ACROSS COUNTRY AND OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF THE U. S. TO FIND- AN ARCHITECT WE CAN. BUILD FOR US SHE STATED THEY ARE STILL. THAT WE ACTUALLY. SERVE THE NEEDS OF A JUVENILE JUDGE. PARTY AND ONE THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR THE NEXT THIRTY. YEARS SO WHEN WE'RE OF FACILITIES CAL. BROADEN MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVER NOW. AND SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF COULD PASS A AND- BECAUSE THERE ARE LOW. AVERAGE DAILY POPULATIONS MOST OR ALL OF THE FACILITIES. YES THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CLOSING DOWN AND OTHERS THAT ARE BEING JEAN THAT. THEIR LOW POPULATIONS- BUT- RELATIONSHIP HAVE FOCUSED ON IN RECENT YEARS IN RETOOLING THEIR FACILITIES AND CREATING MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF STRUCTURES THEY HAD. THAT SAID IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF PART OF THE SOLUTION- PERFORM GOING FORWARD FROM HERE WAS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO RETOOL EVEN FURTHER THERE ARE SOME BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES THAT- IF GIVEN THAT THE RIGHT TECH RESOURCES. COULD BE REHABILITATED AND FACILITIES THAT- THAT WE WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE OUR USE OF LIVING IN HIS HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT'S THE FOCAL POINT OF ALL OF THE TRIPS WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT ONE OUT- HAVING THE LOCAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO INVEST. INTO A STRUCTURE WHERE THERE ARE ONLY A FEW KIDS UP THE HARD ARGUMENT TO MAKE LOCALLY WHEN THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF COMPUTING RESOURCES COMPETING INTERESTS FOR THOSE RESOURCES OUT I THINK SOME WOMEN STONE MENTIONED THAT IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY- THAT THEY HAD THAT THAT THAT PROBLEM WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM ALL OVER THE STATE BUT WE HAVE DIRECTED RESOURCES FOR. FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES LIKE THAT- I KNOW COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN UTILIZING US FUNDS. TO RESTRUCTURE AND REBUILD. OKAY RIGHT WELL YES AS PROBABLY I DIDN'T ON THAT SOMEONE ELSE ON HE WAS NOT OKAY SURE IT'S BRINGING WITH NATIONAL CENTER THOUGHT TO RISK HELLO I DON'T THERE WAS A LOT OF QUICK A LOT OF TIME REQUEST ADDRESS YOU KNOW WHAT IS UNDER AND MAYBE NOT I JUST ABOUT THE LOGISTICS PROPOSE FOR THIS WE- AND I WANT ON THE TWO ISSUES WITH RESPECT ACCOUNTABILITY AND AS WELL AS THE ISSUE OF SPECIMENS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN- IN TERMS OF JUST YOU KNOW JUST. THE BALLOT IN A PATROL THE RULING THE- THAT THAT MAY OF. A HELP PAGE BRING MORE. AND REALLY FOCUS YOU THE- BY. A STATE THAT IS ACTUALLY HAVE EXPERTISE IN YOUTH ISSUES IT IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE OR APPROPRIATE. TO ALLOW. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CORRECTIONS. OFFICIALS TO DICTATE WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST WHETHER REHABILITATION DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED. SIMILAR CARDS THEIR LIVES WHICH IS WHY WE PROPOSE AN OFFICE IF YOU KEPT. THAT WOULD HAPPEN REGULATORY FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEST PRACTICES AND RESEARCH. CAPABILITY TO PROMOTE EVERY QUICK BACKTRACK. AND HANG BACK THAT KNOWLEDGE. TO GRANT MANAGEMENT AND AS WELL AS HAVING THE OFFICE OF YOUTH ADVOCATE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD MANY COUNTY JAILS. IN LIGHT BLUE. AND CALL THEM GET APPROPRIATE RIGHT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM I'VE HEARD COMMENTS. FROM THE PROBATION CHAIRS- ASKING FOR MORE MONEY TO RENOVATE GIVEN ALL THAT I. YOU KNOW I DON'T I WOULD LIKE TO PUT BACK ON THANK THAT WE NEEDED MORE FACILITY BONE. I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN YOU HEARD FROM DANIEL MENDOZA EARLIER THAT MULTI DON'T PEOPLE COULD BE AFFECTED BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. SO BUT I DO HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE LACKING- YOU KNOW SANTA CRUZ COUNTY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT HAS A VERY TINY OUTDATED TO ALL. THAT IF THEY WANTED TO YOU KNOW BUILD THE PROGRAM WOULD NEED IMPROVEMENT AND WE'VE ACCOUNTED. THERE IS A GOOD YOU KNOW THE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT GRANT I DESCRIBED EARLIER THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. TO COUNTY. RENOVATOR GROUP THERE PROGRAM I'M NOT IN. TO MAKE THEM TOUGH BUT TO ME THEM TO BE MILLION. AND TO HOW HIM. I SPENT SEVEN. SEVEN EIGHT MY RATHER IN INVENTOR. YOU CAN ALL. IT WAS THE MIDDLE TIME THERE WAS BRASS. I NEVER GOT TO SEE A TREE. IF OF BRIEF FOR AIR KNOW RIGHT. CHURCH I. BECAUSE WE'RE VERY LIMITED. AND I TO SAY BY GOING TO. WAS FELT LIKE A BOY TO. I ACCEPT THERE BE THEY DID HAVE A- SPACES PROBE. AND HE'LL GO OUT TO RUNNING AND EXPECTS DO OF THE- THINGS ALL. IN A PRISON LIKE FACILITY. BUT THEY HAD THE SPACE. SO I DON'T. WHAT WHAT WHAT I ALSO WANT TO IS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE. AT CONCERN ABOUT ALLOWING TO LONG HAUL TO BE YOU AS LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. BECAUSE OF THIS KIND OF. ITS COUNTER EVIDENCE BASED WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HIT THE BRICK AND MORTAR. YOU KNOW FACILITY THAT YOU KNOW THAT ARE STILL LIVING WITH CORRECTIONS OFFICERS- YOU KNOW. DOING RAISING THEM WE DID FOR PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. PUBLIC HEALTH. ORGANIZATIONS PUBLIC. IN THE COMMUNITY AT CHECK YOU WOULD MANAGE THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. THAT ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND USE A CORPORATION OF RECIDIVISM. BECAUSE WE NEED THE WAY AT THE STATE AND THE NATION I WOULD ARGUE. FROM INCARCERATIONS INCARCERATING KIDS AND SO- DID THE BILL I MEAN IF THIS PROPOSAL. IF APPROVED DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS THAT THE BLOCK GRANT THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER. REQUIRES COUNTIES TO SUBMIT A PLAN. AT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD USE THE MONEY FOR WHAT TYPES OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES FOR WHAT POPULATION. AND ALSO REPORT OKAY- THE FACILITY GRANTS ARE COMPETITIVE IF AND ALSO THE INNOVATIVE% GRANT PROGRAMS. IF WE FIND OR AT THE STATE FIND THAT- LOCAL COUNTIES ARE NOT MEETING. WHAT THEY PROMISED THATTHEY- WILL NOT BE REFUNDED AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND SO THE GOOD PART OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT- PROGRAM IS IT ALLOWS. THE BEST. APPLICATION TO GET THE FUNDING WHAT THE DAY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE UP AGAINST WHAT THEY PROMISED AND THEY ACTUALLY DELIVER. AND THE WRITTEN CONSEQUENCE WILL BE THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW. IS WELL THOUGHT OUT IT IS TO THE- LITTLE AND I BELIEVE THAT A PROBABLY WHAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING TO THE STATUS QUO BUT THERE WILL BE OVERSIGHT THE MOBILE. DATA THE L. AT THE MEASURE. LONGER RESTORATION BUT YOU THOUGHT FRUIT OKAY YOU MUCH I DON'T THINK MOST OF THE LESSONS I WERE JUST ANSWERED BY YOU WITH REGARDS TO A BILL AND PRO A FACILITY AND A WHOLE OF OTHER THING AS WELL AS OF THE OTHER ALL AGREED THAT MANY OF QUESTIONS THEY HAD BEING AT WORK BEING BY. I MAY TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK ALL OF US GOT ANSWERED THAT LAST RESPONSE OUT AT THAT POINT THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND- AS WE MOVE PUBLIC COMMENTS WANT TO SEE FIRST OF ALL DOES ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO'S PHYSICALLY IN THIS ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A ONE MINUTE COMMENT I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT YOU HAVE A ONE MINUTE COMMENT WHICH MEANS.

AND WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL OUR QUESTIONERS AT THIS TIME PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR AND THANKS TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO CALL IN AND TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION OUR THEIR COMMENTS. A QUESTIONS BY THE MEMBERS. OF WANT TO THANK YOU. A READ WHAT WE SAID A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF MOVING DJJ. THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF MOVING UP ACOSTA FROM ONE AGENCY TO THE NEXT IF WE DO THAT THEN WE REALLY WASTING OUR TIME- AND AS A RESULT IT WILL DEFINITELY RESULT AND- CHANGING PROGRAM SOMETIMES CHANGE IN STAFFING CHANGE AND FOCUS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU. ACTUALLY DO A DEEP DIVE AND YOU REALLY WANT TO CHANGE AN AGENT SO. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ANGST AND THE CONCERN OF THOSE WHO CURRENTLY WORK IN THE SYSTEM IS WHERE WHERE THEY FIT IN. HOPEFULLY THEIR INPUT IN THE BEST THAT THEY HAVE TO BRING WILL BE UTILIZED IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEW JUVENILE SYSTEM A SYSTEM WILL LOOK LIKE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THE ON THE BASIC ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY WE WANT SOME CONSISTENCY. SOME SERVICES PROVIDED FOR STUDENTS AS YOUNG PEOPLE I JUST KEEP SAYING STUDENTS THAT'S MY- CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE BUT UP. AND THEY ARE STUDENTS MOST OF THESE FOLKS ARE STUDENTS AND IT WILL CONSISTENCY IN SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED ACROSS THE STATE SO THAT AS WE SAID BEFORE GEOGRAPHY WILL NOT DETERMINE YOUR SUCCESS. IN OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM BUT. WE ALSO WANT RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO GET TO POINT WILL BE ARE MAY A- IN A LOT OF YOUNG. SO THAT THERE IS NO TO ANY OTHER KIND OF JUVENILE SYSTEM WE'VE REDUCED OUR POPULATION BUT WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THE PROCESS OF THAT. AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT THAT MAKES IT BETTER IN TERMS OF WHAT TO DO- AND WE HAVE NOT THUS FAR IDENTIFIED ONE SIZE FIT ALL WE KNOW THAT EACH COUNTY IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE. AND HAS AND HAS DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE UTILIZED BUT THE OUTCOME SHOULD BE THE SAME THE KID SHOULD BE BETTER AS A- OF HAVING. TO THAT SYSTEM AND THEY SHOULD BE GOING OUT AS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR LIVES AND BE A CREDIT TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR FAMILIES- AT FAMILIES COULD BE. AS A ALSO THE PEOPLE. BROUGHT IT TO THAT. THANK WILL THOSE BE ISSUE THAT ARE THERE ARE GETTING TO THE DETAILS GOING TO BE MOST AND PART I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS COMING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN HAVE A ROLE IN MAKING AND- THAT THE OVERSIGHT. IS THERE. AND THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE. TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND HAVE A CO. IN MAKING THE OUTCOME. OR PROVIDED FOR US SO THAT WE FEEL. THAT WE KNOW THE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO IT ACTUALLY MATTERS WE HAVE NOT. A NONE OF US HAVE SAID THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE AN ONLY THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT. RESOURCES NEED TO BE THERE AND SO IS NOT ABOUT CUTTING COST. AT IT'S ABOUT BASICALLY CUTTING WASTE SURELY. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND I THINK THAT'S OUR MAIN FOCUS- AND FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT A BE IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT WE DO AT THIS MOMENT. WILL DETERMINE WHAT THEY WILL DO FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND WHAT THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. AND SUPPORT AS PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD. SO I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR COMING TOGETHER FOR THIS DISCUSSION I'M SURE THIS IS. THE BEGINNING A MANY DISCUSSIONS WE WILL HAVE A DJJ. I'M PLEASED WE'VE MOVED THIS FAR I THINK THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE BEEN. KIND OF CONCERN THAT WE SEEM TO BE STYMIED IN ONE PLACE OF PEOPLE JUST COULD NOT COME TO MOVE. AND BRING CHANGE AND I MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE- OF FOLKS IT TOO MUCH IN IN THEIR OWN MIND VESTED INTEREST AND MOVEMENT. OR NO MOVEMENT I SHOULD SAY. AND SO HAVE. TOGETHER FINALLY WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSALS AND THIS WE KNOW THAT MANY MANY MORE PIECES TO GO WITH IT. I'M HOPING THAT THOSE WHO ARE. CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN COMMITTED THIS WILL STAY WITH THE PROCESS AND THAT THE- THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THOSE. TWO SHOULD. AND FASHION FOR US WHAT WE KNOW WILL BE A MUCH BETTER. SYSTEM FOR THE FOR THE- OF. CELL OF THIS IS SO ONE OF ME. STEP THAT WE HAVE TAKE. THIS WHAT I WANT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO TESTIFIED FOR US TODAY IN THOSE WHO CAME. UP FOR GIVING THEIR INPUT AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HANG IN THERE WITH US AND CONTINUE WITH THE PROCESS. I HAVE A GOOD DAY.
