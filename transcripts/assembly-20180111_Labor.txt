THE HOLIDAYS ARE A TIME FOR FAMILIES TO COME TOGETHER GIVE THANKS AND CREATE MEMORIES. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A FULL ARE A WORK TO WORK A FULL SCHEDULE. IT LEAVES LITTLE TIME AFTER WORK TO SHOP FOR PRESENTS CqC HOLIDAY MEALS. OR HAVE FUN WITH THE FAMILY. CALIFORNIA'S ANTIQUATED LABOR STANDARDS. DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY FOR HARD WORKING PEOPLE OR RETAILERS. CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS. RETAILERS CURRENTLY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A BURDENSOME PROCESS. TO LET EMPLOYEES TO HAVE A FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK. IF A MISTAKE IS MADE DURING THE PROCESS RETAILERS HAVE TO PAY COSTLY OVERTIME WAGES. MY BILL WOULD ELIMINATE COSTS AND THE BURDENS RETAILERS FACE IN ADOPTING. A FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FOR EMPLOYEES WERE LOOKING TO EARN MONEY EXTRA MONEY DURING THE SEASON FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING WOULD GIVE THEM AN EXTRA DAY TO WORK A SECOND JOB. WITHOUT HAVING TO JUGGLE MULTIPLE SHIFTS IN A COURT IN A SINGLE DAY. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE HELPS CALIFORNIA MODERNIZE ITS LABOR LAWS TO BENEFIT EVERYONE. I RESPECTFULLY OSCAR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY. SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE IS LARA CURTIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER COMMERCE. AND FAITH CLAIM WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THE FORTIETH ME WITNESSES. A LOT OF WHAT AFTER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARPER SAID WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE EMPLOYEES ARE CONSISTENTLY ASKING FOR A FEW MORE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THEIR WORK WEEK. THEY WANNA WORK LONGER DAYS AND SHORTER WEEKS IN ORDER SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR FAMILY AND ORDERED A COMEDY CLASS SCHEDULES OR IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT HOWEVER I SIGNED SENATE ARE AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARPER SAT. CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES THAT HAS THE DAY OF THE OVERTIME REQUIREMENT THE OTHER TWO STATES THAT HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT ALLOWING EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER TO ESSENTIALLY WE'VE THE REQUIREMENT. BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT CALIFORNIA HAS NO COMMON SENSE ALTERNATIVE RATHER CALIFORNIA REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO NAVIGATE THEMSELVES THROUGH A MULTI STEP PROCESS WHEREBY AN ENTIRE WORK UNIT MUST VOTE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE. IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE AND. IN ORDER TO ADOPT AN ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE ADDITIONALLY THERE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE EMPLOYER TO POTENTIAL OF LEFT HAND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYER A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE WAY JUST DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND JANUARY IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR EMPLOYEES REQUEST. EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS AND NEGOTIATE AND UPON WRITTEN APPROVAL VOCAL BY EITHER PARTY AT ANY TIME THE ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE A FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE THAT IS WHY WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THEY PLAYED WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISS CURTIS IN THE CHAMBER AND ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE ARE OVER A MILLION FAMILY BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THAT EMPLOYEE SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THAT THE BACKBONE AND THE HEART OF THE ECONOMY OUR MEMBERS OFTEN REPORT THAT THEY WANT FLEXIBILITY WHETHER IT'S TO CHANGE A LUNCH HOUR TO MAKE THEIR CHILD'S LITTLE LEAGUE GAMES OR TO SPEND EXTRA TIME. WITH A CHILD THAT'S HOME FROM COLLEGE FOR THE HOLIDAYS SADLY OUR PLAYERS HAVE TO BE THE BAD GUYS AND TELL THEM THAT STATE LAW PROHIBITS BY. AND OUR MEMBERS OWN FAMILY BUSINESSES BUT THEY ALSO LIKE TO TREAT THEIR MEMBERS LIKE FAMILY AND THIS BILL GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOLIDAYS WHEN THAT EXTRA FAMILY TIME IS IMPORTANT. FOR THAT WE ARE PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. HI ANGIE MINNELLI WAS CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HELLO KITTY HAVE SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION PARENTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON AND SUPPORT. I'VE SEEN NONE WILL NOT HEAR FROM OUR THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. BILL HAS SOME MOTION IS OUR SECOND. BILLS MOVED AND SECONDED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ARE HERE TO IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. FOR THE PRIMARY REASON THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY GIVES EMPLOYERS A WAY TO DO THIS WE HAVE. OUTLINED IN LABOR CODE SECTION FIVE ELEVEN AND ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE PROCESS THAT. VERY CLEARLY ALREADY ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO ASK WORKERS IF THEY WANT TO GO TO SAY FOR TENS AND THERE'S A PROCESS THERE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THIS. THROUGH ELECTION TWO THIRDS OF WORKERS HAVE TO AGREE THERE'S CLEAR LANGUAGE IN THE RAGS THAT PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM INTIMIDATING OR THREATENING WORKERS THAT. MAKE SURE IT'S A FAIR PROCESS THAT WORKERS. THEIR WORKERS CAN PARTICIPATE IN AND WAY AND WE CAN GET A ON THE ACCU WILL ABSORB AND ACTUAL HONEST READ ON WHETHER OR NOT EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES WANT TO GO TO SAY FOR TENS. SO THE PROCESS EXISTS BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OF THESE ELECTIONS SINCE THE LAW'S BEEN IN PLACE. ARM AND YOU WE THINK THE PROCESS GENERALLY WORKS PRETTY WELL THERE'S REALLY NO REASON TO WEAKEN IT WHICH. IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT KIND OF TAKES A LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEK SCHEDULE PROCESS AND. TAKES OUT EVERYTHING IN IT THAT WORKS FOR WORKERS SO THAT TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT IS GONE. INDIVIDUAL WORKERS CAN BE PRESSURED INTO MAKING THIS DECISION THERE THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT SEEKS TO. PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM THREATENING OR INTIMIDATING WORKERS BUT THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO ENFORCE THEM AND THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T ANY STANDARDS THAT PROHIBITS SAY. THESE MEETINGS FROM HAPPENING ONE ON ONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN REALITY MEANS THAT WORKERS WOULD BE PRESSURED INTO AGREEING TO THINGS LIKE THIS ON MORE THIS TO ACTUALLY BE IN PRACTICE. AND FURTHER MORE THE AT THE FACT THAT IT TARGETS NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND JANUARY. SEEM ESPECIALLY PUNITIVE TO US GIVEN THAT THIS IS WHEN WORKERS COSTS TEND TO RISE GIVEN THAT THIS IS WHEN THE HOLIDAYS HAPPEN THIS IS WHEN YOU NEED TO TRAVEL THIS IS WHEN FAMILIES COMING INTO TOWN. IN WORKERS IF ANYTHING NEED MORE MONEY RATHER THAN SEEING THEIR OVERTIME PROTECTIONS ELIMINATED UNDER THE LAW AND SO THESE A VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS WE WOULD URGE OPPOSITION OF THIS FILM. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF BROUGHT INVESTMENT LLP. WE REPRESENT THE TEAMSTERS THAT NOW THE MAIN TRANSIT UNION AND. THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS UNITE HERE THE LONGSHOREMEN I'M AYE OF P. T. LOCAL TWENTY ONE WE OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR SOME BROWN OF CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS HERE IN OPPOSITION AS WELL WE ARE TO KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND STRONG OPPOSITION WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU. CENTER BARRERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. Q. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL TURN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HALF A QUESTION. SOME MEMBERS ARE ANY GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AYE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY READ THE BILL YOU KNOW I'M INTERESTED I LEARNED A LOT FROM THE ANALYSIS SONY THINKS BECAUSE COURSE COMING FROM ORGANIZED LABOR I WOULD TELL YOU OF COURSE THERE'S FLEXIBILITY YOU CAN ALLOW YOUR WORKERS TO. VOLUNTARILY JOIN A UNION AND NOT INTIMIDATE OR HARASS THEM AND THEN THEY COULD. ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE A FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK. BUT NOW I KNOW THAT THERE'S THIS TWO THIRDS ELECTION THAT I NEVER KNEW EXISTED ACTUALLY AMOS'S SO THAT'S VERY INTERESTING AS WELL ANOTHER PROVISION BY WHICH. EMPLOYEES CAN ASSERT IF THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR RIGHT TO FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES IN A MENU OF FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE SO WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SO I THINK THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUT OF A QUESTION ON WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AMEND IN IN YOUR BILL. A CERTAIN NUMBER PROVISIONS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THE WORKER AND THEIR FLEXIBILITY. DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PROVISION FOR. WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO. TO. REJECT WORKING ON HOLIDAYS. WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS IN FACT PROTECTING OTHER SCHEDULES THERE OTHERWISE SCHEDULES E. ON TO THEIR JOB IF THEY REFUSE TO WORK FOR EXAMPLE ON THANKSGIVING AT WALMART OR CHRISTMAS IT DONALD'S. I THINK THAT THOSE ARE. YOU KNOW VERY PERTINENT THAT TOPIC SAID INTO THE LEGISLATURE BUT PROBABLY NOT GERMANE DIRECTLY TO THE BILL ITSELF IN PROBABLY WOULD BE A GOOD TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENTLY AS THEIR OWN. BUT THE REASON STATED FOR THE BILL IS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THEY CAN ENJOY A HOLIDAY SHOPPING. COOKING FOR THEIR KIDS. BUT THAT SEEMS. COUNTER. IF IF IN FACT THEY CAN'T EVEN BE HOME WITH THEIR KIDS ON THE HOLIDAYS AT THEIR OWN CHOOSING. WELL IN IS THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS FOR A WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO BE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE AND SO THAT'S EASILY NEGOTIATED BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE INTEREST IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THOSE DAYS WHICH WERE THE DAYS IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE. I. HAS OFF BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE HOW THE FLEX TIME BY TO ALLOW THE TEN HOUR DAYS TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE DAYS OFF. AND SO SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP BY DIRECTLY FIRE STAND I UNDERSTAND THE POINT A POINT THAT YOU HAVE AND I THINK THAT THIS. THIS UP ALLOWS FOR. EMPLOYEES TO BE MORE EMPOWERED TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WELL I AM I STRONGLY DISAGREE AND IF YOU SEE ANY. OR OR MAYBE TOUCH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS AS I DO ALWAYS AROUND THE HOLIDAY TIME ON ON THIS ISSUE. YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS IN FACT TO HOTEL EMPLOYEES AND ACTUALLY POSTED TO THEIR EMPLOYEES THAT IF THEY. EVEN ATTEMPTED TAKE A LEGALLY PROTECTED SICK DAY DURING THE HOLIDAYS THAT THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOB. AND SO I I A. THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE IN WORK PLACES PARTICULARLY IN RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS IN AND AND DEALING WITH THE WORKERS ARE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE'S NO. I'M ABILITY FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO NEGOTIATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE EMPLOYER AND THIS. BILL DEFINITELY DOESN'T GIVE THE EMPLOYEE ANYMORE RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO RETAIN THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND TO RETAIN THEIR SCHEDULING TO RETAIN. AND THEIR POSITION A WORKPLACE IF THEY WERE TO TRY TO HAVE THOSE EVEN ATTEMPT HAVE THOSE NEGOTIATIONS SO I'M GONNA. VOTE NO TODAY AND I AND AND SUGGEST THAT IF EMPLOYERS ONE COME FORWARD WITH IDEAS ABOUT FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES AND SECURE WHAT'S WORK SCHEDULES AND WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES TO. ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF RIGHTS POSSIBLE THAT WOULD BE GREAT DISCUSSION TO HAVE TOGETHER. INTO REALLY RESPECT WORKERS IN THE RIGHTS TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES DURING THE HOLIDAY OF SOME OF THE VOTING NOW. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR POINT OF VIEW I JUST RESPECT WE DISAGREE. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. SOME REMEMBER MENENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SETTLEMENT HARPER FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL I AM I THINK THERE ARE SOME. VERY VALID CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED OUT ABOUT THIS BILL PARTICULARLY WITH PROTECTION OF THEM OF EMPLOYEES HOWEVER. JUST AS. ONE SUGGEST THAT THERE COULD BE SOME INTIMIDATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN TRYING TO. COERCE WORKERS IN IT YOU KNOW I'M ACCEPTING A PARTICULAR. WORK SCHEDULED THE WEEK THERE'S THERE'S. THAT ALSO EXISTS. IF YOU HAD THE OPTION OF OF A MENU FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE SO THE THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH IN A IN A LEGAL WAY. THROUGH THROUGH THE LIES IN PLACING THE REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE WHAT I. WHAT I KNOW IS THAT PARTICULARLY DURING HOLIDAYS? IS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR WORK ARE HOPING. TO BE HIRED BECAUSE THEY NEED THE EXTRA CASH I'M OR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY EMPLOYED. THERE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE EXTRA HOURS DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO WORK ANOTHER DAY THAT WEEK BUT WOULD CERTAINLY ENJOY THE HOURS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A. A NEGOTIATION THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE SOME MAY NOT WANT TO DO THAT AND OTHERS MAY CHOOSE TO DO THAT I KNOW I HAVE A SON. WHO? WHO WORKS AT HE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND DURING THE HOLIDAYS HE WANTS TO MAKE SOME MONEY AND HE WANTS TO MAKE SOME? YOU KNOW WORK SOME EXTRA HOURS A HE'S YOUNG HE DOESN'T MIND WORKING A TEN HOUR DAY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE BY THE WAY YOU DO WORK TEN HOUR DAYS AND THOUGH. MANY OF THEM ARE. MANY OF THEM ARE UNIONIZED. BUT. SOMEONE SOMEONE WORK IS OUR SOME DON'T I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION I THINK WHEN WE TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY. FROM EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS THAT AND WE WERE GOING FURTHER DOWN THE PATH OF MAKING EMPLOYEES MORE SUBSERVIENT TO THE STATE WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR TO BILL T!I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER CALLED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SAME HARPER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THAT TO SUGGEST THAT A WORKER IS IN THE SAME BARGAINING POSITION AS AN INDIVIDUAL. WITH AN EMPLOYER IS JUST NOT REALITY AND AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON JUST BECAUSE. SOMEONE IS SEEKING ACTUAL PLAN INNER EXTRA RESOURCES EXTRA CASH IN THE HOLIDAYS WHATEVER WHATEVER REASON. IN NO WAY MEANS THAT THEY DON'T. DESERVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY IN THE SAME RIGHTS TO BE ABLE. TO. THE COMPENSATOR PROPERLY AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD. A ESSENTIALLY ALLOW FOR TEN HOUR WORK DAYS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY OVERTIME AND WE DO HAVE A CURRENT PROCESS REQUIRES. A MORE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT. IT THERE IS TRULY CONCERN REGARDING THE HOLIDAYS AND ALLOWING WORKERS STEP PERHAPS IS A TO SPEND TIME THEIR FAMILY I HOPE. I WOULD HOPE MORE RETAILERS WOULDN'T REQUIRE THEIR EMPLOYEES TO WORK ON THANKSGIVING AND WORK ON OTHER HOLIDAYS LIKE THEY DO NOW. THAT'S TRULY THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT% AND SO. I'VE UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PROSPECTIVE I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY. OF AND I BUT I DO HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION A SPECIAL WITH OUR RETAILERS AND AND EMPLOYERS AS TO HOW WE COULD INSURE. THAT WORKERS ARE RESPECTED. DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON SO THAT THEY CAN SPEND MORE TIME WITH OUR LOVED ONES. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SPICER. JEFF OKAY STATE. I'LL ASK JUSTICE WIND IT WAS ADDRESS A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT EMPLOYEES COULD. OF FEEL BULLIED INTO. YOU WORKING IT'S TIME TO THAT IT WON'T WORK. STARBRIGHT LIKE THAT YOU'D ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY BECAUSE I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT AND IF THAT IS THE CASE I WOULD NOT WANNA PUT WORKERS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY WILL BE VULNERABLE. ONTO ESSENTIALLY EARNING LESS MONEY AND WORKING ON A MORE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS WOULD YOU. I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WHAT WE BUILT INTO THIS BILL IS THE THE AGREEMENT THE CONTRACT AYE AND THAT CONTRACT IS VOIDABLE BY THE EMPLOYEE AT ANY TIME. AYE AND SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION I THINK HERE WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE I CAN BE PROTECTED AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE AGAINST THIS IF THEY CHOSE TO DO THEIR SIDE IT. AND ANY TIME I THINK THAT PROVIDES FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THAT I'M THAT I'M SEEKING AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF EMPLOYEES. ARE SEEKING WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE POINT THAT THERE IS ALREADY A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR HOW. EMPLOYEES CAN. RECEIVE A FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BUILT IN. CAPTION FROM ANYONE EMPLOYEE BEING SINGLED OUT BECAUSE IT IS OF VOTE AS OPPOSED TO A INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MANAGER AT WOULD YOU ALL SPEAK TO THAT. I IF I CAN I THINK SHE HAS THE EXPERTISE TO PLACE MORE MORE ARTICULATELY AND I'M MORE ACCURATELY I ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES THE MODEL RIGHT NOW IS ESSENTIALLY MORE OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHO DOESN'T APPROACH INDIVIDUALIZE NEAT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IN LET'S SAY MOM. WANTS TO HAVE EVERYONE SEE OFF BECAUSE OUR TOP WITHOUT A MINIMUM DAY THIS DOESN'T APPROACH THAT NEED WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IT MUST BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE BY THE ENTIRE WORK UNIT WHICH COULD BE LET'S SAY ALL SECRETARIES OF COURSE IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW ALL MAKE A COUNTER PLEASE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY'VE TO VOTE BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE ADDITIONALLY THERE HAS TO BE A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE PRIOR TO THE VOTE. IN ORDER TO NOTIFY ALL EMPLOYEES AT THE VOTE'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN ORDER FOR IT TO PASS THE NEW EMPLOYEES HAVE TO AGREE ON AN ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE OR AS A MENU OF OPTIONS HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. AND TO NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE EMPLOYERS HAVE TO ABIDE BY IN ORDER TO NOT I'M A BIT EXPOSED LITIGATION THEN ONCE THAT OCCURS THEN IS POST ON THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S WEBSITE HOWEVER THERE'S NO REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT EVEN ONCE IT'S POSTED. THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS DONE IN A PROPER MANNER SO THEREFORE IT'S EVEN MORE EXPOSED LITIGATION. SO THE ISSUE WITH THAT IS THAT THERE'S NO INDIVIDUALIZED OPTION FOR ONE EMPLOYEE TO COME AND SAY I OULD LIKE TO NOT WORK. ON WEDNESDAYS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THREE TEN ARE FOUR TEN HOUR DAYS AND FORTY WORK FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK. THANK YOU OF THE BILL HAS A MOTION AND A SECOND AYE I'LL SAY THIS I. APPRECIATE THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT YOU BROUGHT TO THIS CONVERSATION IN THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU ARE MAKING TO TRY AND SUPPORT WORKERS. AYE I'LL SAY THIS IS CHAIR I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONCERN OF THAT MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AT THIS TIME WOULD MAKE WORKERS VULNERABLE. ARE FOR THOSE REASONS ARE FORTUNATE I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AYE AND THE BILL HAS A AS A NO RECOMMENDATION. UP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THAT BUT IF I'M SORRY WE LEFT IT CLOSE SORRY I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST TEEING IT UP SO. I APPRECIATE WEEKLY PUSH BACK ON EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID THAT THIS ISSUE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME I'VE WORKED. VARIOUS HOURLY JOBS UP OVER MY. I WAS AT DOMINO'S PIZZA MY SECOND JOB WAS A KMART MY THIRD JOB WHICH AGAIN IS FOR MORE THE TAXI TO SHOP AT THE LOCAL MALL. FIVE BY DAY EVEN AS RECENTLY AS LAST GET DECADE I WORKED A LONG TERM AYE AT THE HONDA CENTER WHICH IS THE. UP ARENA AND. IN HOCKEY. LOCATION IN ORANGE COUNTY AYE AND. WORKING DURING THE HOLIDAYS AYE IS A FOR ME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PARTICULARLY EXCITING TIME TO BE A PART OF US. OF ALL THE EXCITEMENT THAT PEOPLE HAVE I AND I'VE HAD A PARTICULARLY POSITIVE SITUATION WITH EMPLOYERS THAT I'VE HAD WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS REACHED OUT WHEN THEY WANTED YOU TO WORK DURING THOSE UP. PARTICULAR HOLIDAYS WERE ADJACENT TO THE PARTICULAR HOLIDAYS BUT THEY DID THINGS TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WANTED TO BE ABLE COME OUT TO WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE ABSENTEEISM THEY WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE. AYE TO SHOW UP AND BE MOTIVATED TO TO SHOW UP UP BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND. HOW SOME PEOPLE MAY BE TRYING TO JUGGLE TWO JOBS OR THREE JOBS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THIS CAN HELP THAT KIND OF SITUATION OR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAVE? AYE TIME FOR THEMSELVES I I THINK THAT THIS PROVIDES A GREATER AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AYE AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO LET EVERYONE TO I RESPECTFULLY CONSIDERATE NOW ASK FOR YOUR AYE. THANK YOU YOU HAVE THE LAST WORD ASSEMBLYMEMBER THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN NO THURMAN NO FLORA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTAKEN. THANK YOU. OF THE COMMITTEE WELCOMES ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE WHO WAS PRESENT IN THE CHAMBER TO PRESENT EIGHTY FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I AM PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL REQUIRE TALENT AGENCIES TO TRAIN THEIR STAFF IN THE ARTISTS THEY REPRESENT. IN AN APPROVED SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND HEALTH STANDARDS PROGRAM. THIS LEGISLATION IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER AFTER THE RECENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDALS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE TOWN AGENCIES TO BE EMPLOYERS AND INSTEAD REQUIRES THEM TO ADVISE THE TALENT. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ACT THIS YEAR TO PROTECT TALENT AND DEVELOP PREVENTATIVE METHODS. THESE PROFESSIONAL SAFE IN THEIR WORKING ENVIRONMENT HERE'S TO SPEAK ON THE BILL AYE HAVE SARAH'S IF THE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF THE MODEL ALLIANCE. CARRY OTIS SUTTON A FORMER ACTRESS AND MODEL AND KRISTIN SNOW OF THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WITH ME TODAY. IS THAT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. I I AM HERE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH LAYS OUT IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE LONG OVERDUE TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EATING DISORDERS. IN THE MODELING AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THESE INDUSTRIES IS RAMPANT. I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND AFTER WORKING AS A MODEL SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. UNFORTUNATELY THE AGENTS WHO SHOULD BE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE CAN SOMETIMES BE COMPLICIT IN THESE ABUSES. AND SOME AGENTS EVEN EXHIBIT PREDATORY BEHAVIOR THEMSELVES. IN MY TWO DECADES WORKING AS A MODEL. I NEVER RECEIVED TRAINING ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OR GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW TO REPORT ABUSE. QUITE THE OPPOSITE AS A TEENAGER I WAS MADE TO SIT ON MY MUCH OLDER MALE AGENTS LACK DURING OUR MEETINGS AT THE AGENCY. I WAS ROUTINELY SENT TO SURPRISE NUDE SHOOTS AND CASTINGS EVEN AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS TO MY AGENCY. ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION MY AGENCY ARRANGED MEETINGS AT THE APARTMENTS OR HOTEL ROOMS OF MUCH OLDER MEN. AND UPON ARRIVAL IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO JOB. I WAS FORCED TO NAVIGATE FENDING OFF UNWANTED ADVANCES WITHOUT RUINING MY CAREER. WHEN I BROUGHT MY CONCERNS TO THE PRESIDENT OF ONE AGENCY ABOUT A WELL KNOWN PHOTOGRAPHER HE SHRUGGED AND SUGGESTED I WAS BEING UPTIGHT. SHORTLYTHEREAFTER I LEFT THE AGENCY AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NYPD SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT FOR NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS BY MODELS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SITUATIONS THAT WOULD CLEARLY CONSTITUTE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND AN OFFICE SETTING ARE LESS EASY TO NAVIGATE IN THE MODELING ENTERTAINMENT HISTORIES. BUT JUST BECAUSE THE LINES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DRAW IT DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY MORE OKAYED ACROSS THEM. I AGENCIES EXERT A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROL OVER THEIR TALENTS WORKING LIVES AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO ABUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. RATHER AGENCIES SHOULD PROACTIVELY TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT THESE ABUES. EATING DISORDERS ARE ALSO A MAJOR ISSUE WITH RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD AT HARVARD IN NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY'S THE MODEL LANCE CONDUCTED THE LARGEST STUDY TO DATE ON EATING DISORDERS AMONGST PROFESSIONAL MODELS. THE STUDY CONFIRMED THAT MODELS ARE OFTEN PRESSURE TO LOSE WEIGHT AND JEOPARDY RIGHT JEOPARDIZE THEIR HEALTH IN ORDER TO BiC JOBS. WE FOUND A HIGH PREVALENCE OF UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIOR SUCH AS FASTS DETOX IS USING DIET PILLS AND COCAINE. AND VOMITING. AMONG THE MODEL SURVEYED OVER EIGHTY PERCENT WERE CLASSIFIED AS UNDERWEIGHT. AND YET THESE MODELS REPORTED BEING PRESSURED BY THERE AGENCIES TO LOSE MORE WEIGHT. OVER HALF OF THE MODELS WERE ASKED TO LOSE WEIGHT OR CHNGE THEIR SHAPE. AND TWENTY ONE PERCENT WERE TOLD THEIR AGENCY WOULD STOP REPRESENTING THEM UNLESS THEY LOST WEIGHT. BEING DANGEROUSLY UNDERWEIGHT AND HAVING AN EATING DISORDER CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON A YOUNG PERSON'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN AFFECT THEM FOR LIFE. IN RECENT YEARS SEVERAL MODELS WHO REPORTEDLY SUFFERED FROM EATING DISORDERS HAVE DIED. IN SOME CASES WITHIN MINUTES OF STEPPING OFF A RUNWAY. THE PRESSURES FROM AGENCIES TO ENGAGE IN UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS IS A SERIOUS LABOR ISSUE THAT MUST BE RECOGNIZED AND TREATED AS SUCH. FURTHER THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE. THAT BEING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INCREASES THE RISK OF DEVELOPING AN EATING DISORDER. GIVEN THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEXUAL ABUSE AND EATING DISORDERS IT IS APPROPRIATE INDEED NECESSARY. THAT THESE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED TOGETHER. BY CREATING WHO PROACTIVE REQUIREMENTS WE AIM TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND THIS WILL CREATE A WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE POTENTIAL VICTIMS HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED WITH AWARENESS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY IN CASES OF ABUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I AGAIN URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING YOU TODAY MY NAME IS CARRIE OWED A SUDDEN AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN CALIFORNIA. FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES I'VE WORKED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BOTH AS A MODEL ACTOR AND AUTHOR. IN THAT TIME I'VE INTO WERE COUNTLESS EXPERIENCES OF BOTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN I WAS REPEATEDLY ASSAULTED AND RAPED BY MY THEN AGENT. IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT IF I WERE TO COMPLAIN OR REPORT THESE ASSAULTS IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF MY CAREER. I WAS ADVISED THAT IF I WANTED TO SUCCEED AS A MODEL I WOULD NEED TO TOUGHEN UP. WHICH BASICALLY MEANT BITING MY TONGUE. AND ALLOWINGINFLUENTIAL MEN IN THE INDUSTRY TO ABUSE THEIR POWER. AND I REFUSED STAY SILENT ANY LONGER. THROUGHOUT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE IN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO OFTEN. AND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PREDATORY AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR WAS NORMALIZED. SADLY I CAME TO ACCEPT THAT THESE WERE MY WORKING CONDITIONS. OVER THIRTY YEARS NOT ONE SINGLE AGENT EVER TOLD ME OTHERWISE. NOR WAS I EVER EMPOWER TO SPEAK UP OR TOLD THAT I COULD REPORT THESE ABUSES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE OFFENSES RESULTED IN DEEP TRAUMA THAT LED TO YEARS OF ANOREXIA. ALTHOUGH I WAS OUT APPROVED OUT RELEASE SUCCESSFUL IS A MODEL IN AFTER WORKING AS A FACE OF SOME OF THE BIGGEST BRANDS. I WAS PRIVATELY BATTLING A DO DEBILITATING ILLNESS AND I HAD TO UNDERGO HEART SURGERY AT AGE THIRTY. AS A RESULT OF MY EATING DISORDER. MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE THE REVELATIONS OF THE WINE STEEN SCANDAL THESE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE MADE CLEAR. THAT I AM NOT ALONE. COUNTLESS WOMEN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS ARE SHARING THEIR STORIES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. WE CAN DO BETTER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPANIES IMPLEMENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. FOR EXAMPLE ALL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES MANDATE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE INCLUDING EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP. PARTICIPATE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING TWICE A YEAR. CURRENTLY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND LEADING COMPANIES ADHERE TO THESE STANDARDS. IN AN INDUSTRY THE COMMODIFIED SEX APPEAL AND REGULARLY EMPLOYEES VULNERABLE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS IT'S UNACCEPTABLE FOR AGENCIES NOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. MODELING AGENCY SO YOU SHOULD NOT BE EXEMPTED FROM PROTECTING THEIR WORKERS AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. AND RESPECT AND IN MANY CASES THESE AGENCIES OF THE FIRST AND SOMETIMES ONLY LINE OF DEFENSE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AGENCIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THIS MOST VULNERABLE FORCE. WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEN COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF HOW UBIQUITOUS THIS PREDATORY BEHAVIORS ARE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND DIGNITY OF MODELS ACTORS AND OTHER ARTISTS WORKING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FIX WITH. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KRISTEN SNOW AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION. OR NITA. TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN THURMAN AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. IN ADDITION TO BEING A PROUD CALIFORNIA RESIDENT I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AT THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION. WHICH IS THE LARGEST NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY EATING DISORDERS. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO APPROVE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND HEALTH STANDARDS TRAINING PROGRAM. AND REQUIRE TALENT AGENCIES TO ENSURE THE ARTISTS THEY REPRESENT RECEIVED THE DEVELOP TRAINING. THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARC LEVINE FOR SPONSORSHIP AND LEADERSHIP AND CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT HEALTH STANDARDS TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD REDUCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS THE PREVALENCE OF EATING DISORDERS WHICH ARE CLOSELY LINKED. DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ASSAULT WERE ALMOST TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP BULIMIA THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN VICTIMIZED. FURTHERMORE MODELS EXPERIENCE A SUBSTANTIALLY ELEVATED RISK OF EATING DISORDERS BECAUSE OF EXPECTATIONS PLACED UPON THEM TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN BODY WEIGHT. NEARLY THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS WILL SUFFER FROM AN EATING DISORDER AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE AND IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH AN EATING DISORDER. IS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS. EATING DISORDERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE THE AFFECT ALL PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS RACES AGES AND SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. EATING DISORDERSUCH AS ANOREXIA NERVOSA BINGE EATING DISORDER AND BULIMIA NERVOSA ARE COMPLEX MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHICH LEAD TO CHRONIC HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. AND THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE OF ANY MENTAL ILLNESS. FOR FEMALES BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD WHO SUFFER FROM ANOREXIA THE MORTALITY RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ILLNESS IS TWELVE TIMES HIGHER THEN THE DEATH RATE OF ALL OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH. FURTHERMORE. RISK OF DEATH FROM SUICIDE ARE MEANT MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS IS MARKEDLY INCREASED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EATING DISORDERS. ALTHOUGH QUITE SERIOUS EATING DISORDERS CAN BE PREVENTED WE BELIEVE THAT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND HEALTH STANDARDS TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT. IN THE PREVENTION OF BOTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EATING DISORDERS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. THE REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT IN AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEX ARE LONG OVERDUE. IT IS TIME THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT THESE IMPORTANT PROTECT. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER IN PROTECTING MODELS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY FROM THESE DANGEROUS ILLNESS AS. WE AT THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES AND THANK THE WITNESSES WHO SHARED VERY PERSONAL AND DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES SADDENED NAY WERE SADDENED TO HEAR THAT THESE HAVE OCCURRED BUT WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE COURAGE IN AND AND RAISING THEM TO THE SURFACE. THIS COMMITTEE ALWAYS WELCOMES THOSE WHO WILLINGLY SHARE THINGS PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY AND THAT WILL HELP TO PROTECT OF THOSE IN A WORKFORCE IN EVERY SECTOR THANK YOU. ARE NOW CALLING ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. I'M SORRY IT WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITION FIRST. DO WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE ANYONE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. IF IT'S APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME CHAIRMAN I'M I'M CARE STUART AND FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS. WE SUPPORT IF AMENDED I SEE. SO IF I IT THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME WAITING TO TELL ME THAT NOW LONG MEETINGS THIS WEEK TO TALK ABOUT NOT HOT BUT NOT. OF OF COURSE IT IS WELCOME. WHEN I SAW YOU STAND ABOUT THAT YOU WERE COMING TO PRESENT OPPOSITION PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR SUPPORT IF AMEND PASSAIC YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF I REPRESENT THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS IT'S AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD TRADE ASSOCIATION I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE OF THIS IS AN EXPEDITED BILL AND OF COURSE THE CHAIRMAN IS RIGHT WE DID SPEAK ABOUT THIS BILL THE OTHER DAY. SO BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A RUSH. I WANT TO PLEASE READ IF I MAY AND A LETTER. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TO THE TABLE TO MAKE A STATEMENT WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE SOME PROPRIA UP WE WELCOME YOU WE WELCOME. SO AS I SAID. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS. AND. WE ARE A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION A WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED TALENT AGENCIES LICENSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE TALENT AGENCIES PROBABLY REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKING ARTISTS TODAY. OUR MEMBER AGENCIES REPRESENT DIRECTORS WRITERS AND OTHER ARTISTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT ENTERPRISES INCLUDING MODELS. AND ALL OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE TO BE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CURRENT TALENT AGENCIES ACT. ATA DESIRES TO SUPPORT EIGHTY BE FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX IF AMENDED AND TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE UNIONS THE GUILDS ALONG WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP AN INDUSTRY WIDE SOLUTION. THAT NOT ONLY FOSTERS A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO ADDRESSES THE COMPLEX INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. GIVEN THE EXPEDITED SCHEDULE AND OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN ASSURANCES THAT IN THE CURRENT FORM EIGHT BE SEVENTY EIGHT YEAH I'M SORRY AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX IS NOT IN FINAL FORM AND HE LOOKS FORWARD TO PARDONING WITH PTA. TO PERFECT THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. I DO WANT TO MENTION SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS OF THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL THAT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A NEW HEALTH STANDARD FOR MODELS WHILE EMPLOYING PROVISIONS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE CONTAINED IN AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY NINE. OH ALSO ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE AND THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THIS BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. SPECIFICALLY AB FIFTY FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX REQUIRES THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD CAL OSHA. TO ADOPT AN OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARD FOR MODELS. TO DEAL WITH THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. THE BILL CONTAINS NO REAL DEFINITION FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES HEALTHY AND WE BELIEVE IT CAN ENCOURAGE POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ARTISTS. IF THEY FALL OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER THIS AMBIGUOUS HEALTHY LABEL IS. BUT ATA AND OUR MEMBERS STRONGLY AGREE THE PROFESSIONAL FASHION MODELS LIKE ALL WORKERS ARE ENTITLED TO SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AB SET FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX MAY MAKE A MISTAKE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MODELS AND THE AGENTS. BUT WE REALLY SEEK TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS OTHER CONCERN LAWMAKERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE MODELS ALLIANCE. IN AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THE IMPORTANT UNDERLYING OBJECTIVES OF WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE CONTAINED IN MAYBE FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE ADDING ON IN SUPPORT OR SUPPORT IF AMENDED. THANK YOU CNN RECALL ANY OPPOSITION. THE OPPOSITION TODAY. SEEING NONE OUT UNDER THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BECAUSE I DON'T. YOU AGREE THAT HER STATEMENT IS RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE MADE. ASSERTIONS THAT THIS BILL IS NOT. POLICY WISE WHERE IT'S GONNA END UP AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH. THE TALENT AGENCIES I THINK IT'S A THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S A OF IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SAY WHAT I'VE SAID BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WHICH IS UP FOR SMALL I'M GRATEFUL FOR MS STEWART SUPPORT. IF AMENDED POSITION FOR HER AGENCY I HAVE ASSURED HER THAT TO I SEE HER AGENCY AS A UP HER ASSOCIATION AS A PARTNER IN THE BILL. AND THAT WE WILL. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE FEEDBACK FROM HER MEMBERSHIP BUT ALSO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THIS BODY. AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE SIDE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT TAD BOTH THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT ON THIS ISSUE THAT SHOULD NOT. INFORMED THE POLICY IN A VACUUM OF GETTING THE POLICY RIGHT AND HAVE IT WORK WELL FOR BOTH THE TALENT AND THE AGENCIES. I AM I'M A SUPPORT THIS TODAY AS I TOLD YOU I WOULD THESE IN AND JUST BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT MY CONCERNS BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE TIMING. I BELIEVE THIS IF PASCO'S GO PREPARATIONS. AND. WOULD BE. MOVED IN OR OUT BY NEXT WEEK. I HAVE EX STREAM CONCERNS ABOUT MOVING A BILL THAT POLICY REALLY NEEDS BE DEVELOPED OUT OF THIS HOUSE S. B. FORTS DEVELOP IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE IN THIS. AND I UNDERSTAND I MEAN WE ALL OF. MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO PUT OUR BILLS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AND I'M. I'M THE SAME WAY I'M GONNA GO EXPLAIN IT I REALLY THINK THIS BILL SHOULD I STARTED AS A FRESH BELL. I'M I THINK THAT THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. AND CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED THAT ARE REALISTIC AND. NEED SOME VETTING I THINK IT'S TOO IMPORTANT VINICIO TOTO RUSH IT THROUGH. IN IT IN A WAY THAT THAT THERE'S THESE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ONE THAT I HAD OR ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE DON'T EVEN HAVE AGENCY REPRESENTATION. AND SO WE HAVE. AT. WE WORK FOR TACKLING A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN AND THE BUSINESS AND NOT THOSE WHO ARE ARE TRYING TO ENTER THE BUSINESS AND SOMETIMES ARE ARE PULLED. HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA OF THEIR RIGHTS AS WELL I THINK ALL WORKERS SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS NOT SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT MY AND I'M LOOKING AT ANOTHER BILLS IS WE DON'T IN THE UNITED STATES EVER INFORM WORKERS ANY WORKERS. OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE IN THE WORKPLACE. BUT WHAT THEY'RE RIGHT WHERE THEY GO TO REPORT THOSE RIGHTS MINIMUM COME FROM LABOR THIS IS LIKE A HUGE ISSUE AND ONE WHICH I THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET RIGHT. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE ENTERTAINMENT STREETS ONE OF MANY MANY INDUSTRIES. THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT AND I'M STILL UNSURE WHY. IN MOST INDUSTRIES WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT SWEET REALLY LOOK AT THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT AND OF COURSE THIS AGENT THIS. INDUSTRY IS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPICAL EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP AM VERY AWARE. OF OF THAT IN IN SO WERE PUTTING AN ONUS ON REPRESENTATION AND AGENCIES. THAT NORMALLY WE REPLACE SEEN ON EMPLOYERS I'M AND I KIND OF LIKEN IT TO. YOU KNOW I I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. WITH CONCUSSIONS IN THE NFL AND SO IF I WOULD WANT TO DO A BILL ON THAT WHICH I MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE. THAT WE WE WOULD GO. TOWARDS ENSURING THAT THE NFL OR OR WORLD FOOTBALL OR COLLEGE FOOTBALL CHANGES THEIR PRACTICES. AND NOT GO TOWARDS SPORTS AGENTS TO REQUIRE THEM TO SOMEHOW CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES. AND HAVE AN UPWARD PUSH ON THE EMPLOYER NOW NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED OF MY OWN ARGUMENT BECAUSE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POWER STRUCTURE WHERE WHERE WORKERS HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT POWER IN AND I'M CONSUMER LEAVING OUT? THE LOWEST. EMPOWERED WORKERS I DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATION THEY HAVE WORKERS WITH REPRESENTATION THEN YOU HAVE THE REPRESENTATION KIND HAVE THIS OTHER SPOT AND THEN YOU HAVE THE EMPLOYER'S RIGHT WITH WITH. YOU KNOW OF A FASHION HOUSE DECIDES THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MODELS AT A CERTAIN WEIGHT. THERE'S NOT A LOT THE AGENT CAN DO IT NOW RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE HAVING. OR CERTAIN LOOK. IT'S COMPLICATED AND THAT'S WHY I SUGGEST THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO HAVE THE THE. TONE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL WORK WITH HOPEFULLY AND I WOULD EXPECT THIS WITH. WITH THE TALENT TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND KIND OF PUT SOME IN CONJUNCTION AND HAS THEM FIGHTING TOGETHER AGAINST KIND OF THIS INDUSTRY THAT'S VERY SPECIAL INDUSTRY WHICH IS AFFECTING NOT ONLY THE WORKERS AND INDUSTRY BUT ALSO HOW EVERY LITTLE GIRL. INVOICE SEE THEMSELVES AS AS THEY SEE A REFLECTION IN IT SO. GIVEN NOT. BUT THE LOT THERE. IT WE GOT A WEEK. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT I'M I'M TO VOTE FOR THIS AND I HOPE IT MOVES FORWARD. AND YOU NOW AYE AYE WERE NOT EXPERTS IN THIS COMMITTEE I I JUST I'M NOT. THERE AT THE I'M GIVING YOU A WARNING THAT I DON'T USUALLY GIVE PEOPLE YOU HOW I'M NOT THERE OF OF MOVING A BILL THAT HAS SO MANY POLICY IMPLICATIONS. OUT OF THIS HOUSE. SO QUICKLY IF WE CAN'T COME TO SOMETHING WITH AND SO I I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU START. ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS. RIGHT AFTER THIS COMMITTEE IF THEY YEAH I SHOULD JUST SHUT UP BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU GONNA VOTE FOR IN COMMITTEE BUT. I THINK IT. YEAH I KNOW THAT. SHE RAISES A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES WHERE. I THINK THIS PRIDE OF LIKE WHAT WORK MUST TAKE PLACE IN THIS HOUSE VERSUS THE FACT THAT. ANY OF YOU AT ANY POINT AND TIME IN THE LIFE OF THIS BILL. ARE WELCOME TO OUT WEIGH IN. ON HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK RIGHT NOT JUST YOU KNOW ON THE AGENCY'S BEHALF. BUT BUT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OF EVERYBODY. AND THAT DOESN'T STOP THERE'S NO EXPIRATION DATE ON THAT SO I I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE IS THERE A MOTION. BILL'S BEEN MOVED IS HER SECOND. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR. THREE. WITNESSES WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY IN PAINFUL TESTIMONY THAT. IT SHOWS THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR SUCCESS. YOU CAN BE OF VICTIM. AND IT'S IT IN YOUR VULNERABLE. AND EVEN IF. YOU MEET. A SOCIETY OR MEDIA SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF BEAUTY. THAT THAT VULNERABILITY. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH EN AND SAY THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE PROTECTED EVERY MAN AND WOMAN. IN THIS ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN IN THE SECTOR AYE IS DESERVING OF THAT DIGNITY. AND THAT PROTECTION AND I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE CLEARLY OF MUCH IS NEEDED TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS BOTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ACTUAL SALT. AND EATING DISORDERS AND SO WE APPLIED TO YOU IN THAT EFFORT. WE ALSO TAKE IT TO HEART T. WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE AGENCIES AND WORK WITHIN THE TIMELINE THAT WAS DISCUSS TODAY. BECAUSE THESE ARE REALLY COMPLEX ISSUES AND IT'S A DIFFERENT SECTOR THAN OTHER SECTORS IN. AND SO THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE BROAD IMBALANCE FOR AGENTS IN EMPLOYERS IN THOSE WHO WERE A WHO ARE INFECTED SO. THE BILL ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE.
