00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.028
RECOMMENDED LAST AROUND ONE

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.630
PROJECTS THAT LIST APPEARED

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.698
REASONABLE TO US ON THE

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.332
METHODOLOGY THAT THE

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.034
ADMINISTRATION USED GENERALLY

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.569
ALIGNS WITH THE STATUTORY

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.971
GUIDANCE. WE WOULD EMPHASIZE

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.540
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:23.709
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO IT TOO-

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.077
ISSUE ROUND ONE GRANTS AND

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:27.446
THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATURE RIGHT

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.549
GUIDANCE IS RATHER BROAD. AND WE

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.783
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.118
WEIGHING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.287
AGAINST THE US DEPARTMENT

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:36.389
FINANCES RECOMMENDED LESS. AND

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.057
TERMINATE SHOULD PRODUCE OUR

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:41.027

. YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF VARIOUS

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:49.235
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- FROM US

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:49.936
YOU'LL HEAR THEM FROM THE

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:53.072
SEGMENTS WELL WE GIVE OUR OWN

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.941
SET OF- ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.876
BEGINNING ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.744
YOUR AGENDA. BUT IN REVIEWING

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.713
ALL THESE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.647
WE THINK A GOOD STARTING POINT

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.150
IS AGAIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:04.717
LEGISLATURE'S GOALS FOR THE

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.486

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:08.321
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES APPROACH

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.122
REALLY EMPHASIZES COLLEGE

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.158
AFFORDABILITY. AND IF THAT IS

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:12.992

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.728
FUNDAMENTAL- OBJECTIVE HERE THEN

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:16.863
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.631
RECOMMENDED LAST IS A REASONABLE

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.733
STARTING POINT. THAT'S IT IF THE

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.901
LEGISLATURE HAS BROADER

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.870

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.045
A- DIRECT GRANT TO STUDENTS THAT

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:20.979
WOULD REDUCE THE COST OF

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.815
HOUSING. THE CSU ASKED FOR FIFTY

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.550
MILLION BE APPROVED EFFECTIVE SO

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.119
THE BEDS COULD BE OFFERED

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.154
AVAILABLE BEDS COULD BE OFFERED

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.056
TO LOOK IN STUDENTS AT THE RATE

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.991
DEFINED IN THE STATUTE. THE CSU

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.526
WOULD SET UP TYPE OF IN DOWN

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.295
MEANT TO USE THE FUNDS OVER TIME

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:38.897
WITH TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS BE

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.432
THE GOAL THEN WE WOULD USE THE

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:43.502
AMOUNT OF. PROCEEDS AND EARNED

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.804
BY THE INVESTMENT TO. SUBSIDIZE

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:47.739
THE COST TO LOOKING STUDENTS THE

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.441
PROJECT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.176
A MATTER OF MONTHS VERSES

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:53.879
ROUGHLY THREE TO FOUR YEARS FOR

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:54.913
NEW CONSTRUCTION. THIS APPROACH

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.416
WOULD CRITICS WIDGET NOT EXPOSE

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:59.051
THE PROGRAM TO BE CONTINUED

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.286
CONSTRUCTION COST ESCALATION AS

A CAMPUSES WITH AVAILABLE BEDS

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.090
COULD PURCHASE MADE IMMEDIATELY

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.392
SO IT'S FASTER. IT INCREASES THE

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.760
AMOUNT OF PORTABLE HOUSING

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.362
SUPPORTS IT RENDITION OF

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:11.997
BALANCES OUT THE BILL ABILITY

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.899
AND AFFORDABILITY SO IN SUMMARY

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:16.301
THE CSU REQUEST IS FOR FOUR

COMMITTEE. COMMENTS AND

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:34.586
QUESTIONS. AND LET ME BEGIN. OF

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:35.687
BY JUST MAKING A COUPLE OF

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:39.758
COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY- OF THE TWO

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.126
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.694
APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR FOR THIS

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.096
PURPOSE OVER THREE YEARS WAS

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:48.333
OVERSUBSCRIBED AND- INDICATED A

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.536
DRAMATIC NEED. AND SO THAT IS

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:54.773
WHY. OF THERE HAS BEEN A

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.641
PROPOSAL FROM- THE SENATE

00:22:56.708 --> 00:23:00.312
MAJORITY TO ADD ONE POINT FIVE

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:07.185
MILLION ODD TO TRY. TO ADDRESS

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.854
THAT NEED. IS WHAT WE ARE HERE

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.455
TODAY- SECOND. I KNOW THAT PROBE

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.257
WAS REALLY QUICKLY BY THE- AFTER

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.759
IT WAS APPROVED AND THAT DID NOT

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.894
BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE. AND I

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.796
THINK OCCASIONALLY THERE WERE

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:18.930
SOME THINGS LOST IN THE

00:23:18.997 --> 00:23:21.600
TRANSLATION AND I KNOW THAT WHEN

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:23.902
THE GRANTS WENT OUT. IT WAS NOT

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.939
MADE CLEAR THAT. HE LANDING IN

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:30.342
CONSTRUCTION GRANTS TOGETHER FOR

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:31.543
THE SAME PROJECT WOULD NOT BE

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.945
ALLOWED TO NEARBY I KNOW IT WAS

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:35.313
ONE PLACE IN MY DISTRICT DID

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.448
THAT DID THEY WERE REALLY

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.983
DISAPPOINTED. BECAUSE THAT

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:39.718
WASN'T LAID OUT IN ADVANCE WITH

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.586
CLARITY AND SO I WOULD JUST

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.688
REITERATE. THAT IT'S GOOD TO BE

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.524
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.058
EXPECTATION IS FROM THE

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.293
APPLICANTS SO THAT THEY CAN

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.197
RESPOND IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.699
AND- THEN. LET ME MOVE TO A

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.501

ONE OF THESE PROJECTS SO- VERY

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.323
LIKELY WE WILL SEE COST

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.260

COLLEGES WHEN WE ADDRESS SOME OF

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.179
THE KEY POINTS THAT THE

LEGISLATURE MENTIONED THE FIRST

00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:00.118
ALL TALK ABOUT AND REYES RELATED

HOUSING PLANS INTO PLATFORM WE

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:20.638
HAVE A COLD FUSION SO THAT WE

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:22.674
HAVE DATA ACCESSIBLE TO USE SO

ELEMENTS WILL ALSO- WE'RE

00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:32.717
INTEGRATING A LOOKING AT TOTAL

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.986
COST OF OWNERSHIP WE WANT TO

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.559
BE SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:44.095
COSTS. AND WE KNOW THAT BUILDING

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.463

WE DO THINK THAT THAT IS AN

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.374
IMPORTANT ELEMENT. AND THE

CAN PROVE THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN

00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:28.540
THIS AGAIN. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:30.575
JUST THE COSTS NOW BUT THERE ARE

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:34.212

LOCALLY- SOME OF THE SOUND BEDS

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.840
WILL BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND SO

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.209
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- EXPECTED

TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ON THE

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:23.961
CASE THE POINT OF THE

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:24.695
CONTINGENCY WE ACTUALLY DID

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:27.064
PROVIDE A 10% CONTINGENCY TO ALL

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.067
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN FOR

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:30.802
THE FROM THE UC IN THE CSU THEY

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:33.771
DID BUILT IN A 5% CONTINGENCY.

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:34.572
INTO EACH OF THEIR PROJECT

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.442
PROPOSALS- SO THAT THAT'S FOR

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.910
ONE AND THEN ADDITIONALLY JUST%

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.845
TO KIND OF GO INTO OUR THOUGHT

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:43.080
PROCESS AND THE WAY THAT WE

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:43.915
HAVE. SELECTED PROJECTS AS WE

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:46.184
REALLY FOLLOWED- WHAT WAS

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.753
REQUIRED IN STATUTE- YOUKNOW

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.588
FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIRED FRANK

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.990
ACOSTA- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:55.059
CERTAIN STUDENT METRICS OUR

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.129
REQUIRED- AND THEN WE KIND OF WE

00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.897
WEEDED OUT PROJECTS BASED ON

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:01.332
THAT INITIALLY AND THEN WE WENT

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:03.901
INTO RANKING PROJECTS BASED ON.

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:06.170
THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS WHICH WAS

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.339
REALLY AN EFFICIENCY METRICS AS

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.074
WELL AS THE STUDENT RIGHT COST

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:12.176
WHICH WAS- IN AFFORDABILITY

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.945
METRICS- AND THROUGH THAT

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.880
ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT THAT WAS

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.850
ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO. TO

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.818
RANK PROJECTS AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:21.786
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MORE

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:24.188
UNIVERSAL AND METRIC THAT COULD

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.023
BE COMPATIBLE AGAINST DIFFERENT

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.592
PROJECTS AND I WAS REALLY OUR

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:29.660
THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND- WHAT

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:33.865
WHAT WE PUT FORWARD. TO THE

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.600
LEGISLATURE- AND HAPPY DANCE ANY

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.335
QUESTIONS THANK YOU LET ME ASK.

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:39.337
THE L. A. O. IF IN THIS ROUND

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:41.205
ROBIN YOU HAVE BEEN THE LAST

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:43.040
COMMENT ON WHAT YOU HEARD FROM

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:44.709
THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OR THE

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:49.013
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SURE SO-

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.581
I YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.782
RELEASED- ANYTHING'S ARE ANY

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:54.819
ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY ON- A LOT

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.721
OF THAT POINTS THAT WERE RAISED

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:58.589
HERE SO- YOU KNOW WE'D BE HAPPY

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:01.158
TO WORK WITH STAFF IN THE COMING

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.126
WEEKS ON ANY ITEMS OF PARTICULAR

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:04.562
INTEREST ON THE USED TO COMMENT

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.664
ON THE STATURE RANCH IS A BIG

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:09.400
LEAP. FROM IN OUR ANALYSIS WE

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:11.602
RAISED- SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.872
AROUND THE PROPOSED STATUTORY

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:17.308
RENTS- OUR- OUR POINT WAS A

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:19.443
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.612
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:22.880
THE STATUTORY WRENCH THAT THAT

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:25.750
MEASURE. 30% OR 50% OF ANY AREAS

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.351
NEEDING INCOME. AS A COMMON

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.819
MEASURE USED IN AFFORDABLE

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:30.488
HOUSING PROGRAMS. WITHIN THE

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:31.889
COLLEGE CONTEXT IS A LITTLE

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.958
DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE. THAT'S

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:34.659
BECAUSE A LOT OF STUDENTS

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:37.828
PARTICULARLY AT UC AND CSU. ARE

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.597
IT DEPENDENCE AND THEIR

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:41.332
HOUSEHOLDS ARE ALREADY SPENDING

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:43.334
A PORTION OF THEIR INCOME. ON

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:45.036
THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND SO

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:46.237
THEY LIKELY COULD NOT IN

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.838
CONCEPTS ALSO DEVOTING

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.540
ADDITIONAL 30% OF THEIR ANNUAL

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.242
INCOME TO SUPPORT HOUSING FOR

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.944
THEIR COLLEGE STUDENT.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.412
INTERNALLY SPEAKING THE WAY WE

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.680
THINK ABOUT FINANCIAL AID IS

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:56.948
VERY DIFFERENT IT OFTEN SEEMS

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.416
STUDENTS AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD

00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.850
SAVE MONEY OVER TIME WORK PART

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:02.587
TIME. IT'S BASED ON THE SORT OF

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:03.988
EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AND

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.757
FINANCIAL NEED. AND SO WE DID

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:07.391

PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD- AS IN

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.673

THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO BEGIN

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.055

DEGREE IS THIS AN ISSUE OF A

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:54.225
LACK OF LOW INCOME OR LOWER COST

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:55.760

SUPPLY ANY LACK OF LOWER COST

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:05.603
SUPPLY. I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.538
OUT YOU KNOW IS THERE SOME

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:08.739
STUDENTS THEY AND I PLACES LIKE

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.207
UC IRVINE OUR COMMUNITY

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:11.308
COLLEGES. THAT CAN CERTAINLY

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:13.010
AFFORD TO PAY FOR MARKET RATE

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.278
HOUSING. ARE THERE SOME STUDENTS

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.846
THAT YOU DON'T NEED SOME HELP

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.548

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:18.582
LOWER COST HOUSING AND I'M

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.718
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF IF

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.453
WE'VE- ANALYZED THIS ISSUE. AND

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.755
WHAT DEGREE E. INTO THIS IS.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:25.956
THIS THE SAME FROM ARE FACING

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.291
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.059
RIGHT NOW THERE'S BOTH A LACK OF

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.828
SUPPLY. AND A LACK OF SUPPLY FOR

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:32.530
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND AGAIN

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.165
TRYING TO GET THAT SENSE SO IF

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:44.775
YOU HAVE. ANY COMMENTS OR

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.478
THOUGHTS I'D APPRECIATE HEARING

. LET'S START WITH THAT. L. SURE

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:52.550
SO I THINK- I THINK YOU RAISE A

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.751
KIND OF KEY CONSIDERING FOR THE

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:54.985
LARGEST WHICH YOU KNOW WHETHER

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:56.787
TO FOLK ON SORT OF OVER HOUSING

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:58.689
FOR COLLEGE OR WHETHER THE FOCUS

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.024
BE MORE ON THE FOR. AND OVERALL

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.725
CULTURE FOR AND AFFORDABILITY IN

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:02.560
FOR TWO- YOU KNOW CONSENT THE

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.128
PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IN

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:06.030
PROVIDING STATE FUNDING FOR

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:08.065
HOUSING PROJECTS ARGUABLY IS. ON

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.401
AFFORDABILITY THAT'S BECAUSE

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:12.036
CAMPUSES HAVE LONG BEEN IT WAS

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:13.437
PARTICULARLY AT UC INTO ME AND

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.739
THE CSU SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN ABLE

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.708
TO FIND HOUSING PROJECTS FROM

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.476
HOUSING FEE REVENUE AND SO

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.811
CONCEPTUALLY THE AYE THE

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:22.146
ADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING STATE

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:23.681
FUNDING IS TO MAKE THESE AND

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:24.748
IT'S MORE AFFORDABLE.

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.516
SUMMARIZING A PORTION OF THE

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.551
COSTS HOSTER THAT THEY ARE

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:31.755
INTENDED RENTS CAN BE LOWER THAN

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:32.756
THE OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS. ONLY

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.692
WE DID LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN THE

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:35.793
FALL AND THEN WE GENERALLY HEARD

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.828
FROM CAMPUSES THAT MANY OF THEM

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:39.897
WERE. ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.532
STUDENT HOUSING THAT FROM

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.467
STUDENT FEE REVENUE OVER TIME.

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:44.768
AND SO AGAIN THAT THAT SEEM TO

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:45.970
SUGGEST AT LEAST THAT WASN'T

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:48.772
NECESSARILY A FUNDING ISSUE IN

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:49.840
TERMS OF INCREASING OVERALL

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:50.474
HOUSING SUPPLY. YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.210
A THERE ARE CASES WHERE CAMPUSES

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:54.879
DO-EXPERIENCES INSTANCE

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:56.714
INSTANCES WHERE THERE CAN BE SIR

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.582
TIGHTER HOUSING THE NORMAL-

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.251
WE'VE HEARD THAT AND I DON'T WE

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.986
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UC MERCED

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:02.820
CAMPUS. AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:05.089
CASES WHERE- YOU KNOW CAMPUS IS

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:06.790
A MOMENT. IT'S PAST THREE CAN

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.592
ALSO BE LIMITED BASED ON HOUSING

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.928
CAPACITY THAT RECENTLY CAME UP

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:12.997
WITH UC BERKELEY- THAT CERTAINLY

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:13.864
IS AN ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.066
COULD THINK ABOUT THAT ARE YOU

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.301
KNOW AT LEAST. FROM OUR

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:17.902
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIMARY

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.103
VANTAGE OF PROVIDING A STATE

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.471
SUBSIDY FOR THIS PROJECT IS TO

00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.406

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:35.753
CRISIS AND WE HAVE HEARD THROUGH

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.688
VARIOUS LEGISLATION ANECDOTALLY

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:39.623

ARE GOING ON HOUSE OR LIVING IN

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:47.031
CARS- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.933
REALLY AIMS TO ADDRESS ACTUALLY

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.601
BOTH OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.269
MENTIONED. WHICH IS INCREASING

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.904
THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING AT THESE

COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.408
WELL AS PROVIDING MORE

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.944
AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT BECAUSE

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.880
THE RENT IS CAPPED- TO PROVIDE

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.783
THE MOST AFFORDABLE RENT TO

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.885
STUDENTS. GOT IN AND I ASISTIR

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:09.687
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.422
WHILE A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS IN

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.090
COLLEGE OR OR IN GRAD SCHOOL-

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.292
BUT MY SENSE WAS. AT THE TIME

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:17.928
AND I WAS NOT- IF SOMEONE IN THE

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.331
ADMINISTRATION BUT I- YOU KNOW

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.966
IT MY SENSE WAS THAT THERE'S A

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:22.967
LOT OF CROSS SUBSIDY HAPPENING

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.635
AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S NOT

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.370
SOMETHING WE CAN EMPHASIZE MORE

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.138
AND I GUESS THIS CASE LA WAS

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:29.540
POINT ABOUT- ROLLING UP.

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.608
FINANCIAL AID INTO HOUSING BUT-

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.643
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT FOR

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.811
DIFFERENT FOLKS BASED ON THEIR

INCOME AND NEED GOT DIFFERENT

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:37.348
PACKAGES- SOME FOLKS WERE PAYING

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.882
THE FULL. FREIGHT AND THEN

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.018
INCLUDED YOU KNOW THAT COSTA

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.087
HOUSING AT MARKET RATE IN AND SO

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.022
IF THIS WARRANT A MATTER OF LACK

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.490
OF HOUSING AND I JUST WONDER IF

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.625
WE CAN RELY A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.994
THAT- PARTICULARLY THE

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.029
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND THIS

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.931
GETS KIND OF TO SECOND POINT

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.099
WHICH IS- DEPARTMENT FINANCE I

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:57.267
THINK THAT GERMAN LATER DID TRY

00:43:57.334 --> 00:44:01.171
TO GET THAT THIS IS BY ASKING

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:02.106
ABOUT YOUR- ASSESSMENT OF THE

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.307
DIFFERENT. HOW ABRUPT. PER BY

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.309
THE ALEJO. BUT I JUST WANTED TO

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.510
ACTUALLY GET. ON ONE BECAUSE I

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:09.246
THINK. FOR ME THIS KIND OF GETS

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.581
THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE. YOU RIGHT

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:11.982
NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT EMPHASIZE

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:13.317
THE ADMINISTRATION EMPHASIZES

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:17.187
THE COST PER BED. AND I THINK

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.689
ONE OF THE PURCHASE SUGGESTED BY

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.858
THE L. A. O. IS THAT WE COULD

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.159
LOOK AT. THE COMPARISON OF THE

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.495
COSTS PER BED VIS A VIS THE

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:28.799
MARKET RATE OR OR- NON STUDENT

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.700
HOUSING IN TE AREA AND I'M

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.535
WONDERING. WHY THAT'S NOT A

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:32.970
PREFERABLE APPROACH BECAUSE THAT

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:35.572
MIGHT GET TO MORE OF. DAY HIGH

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.241
COST AREA ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.542
RAISED THAT IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.077
JUST LOOKING AT. A NOMINAL

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:42.413
FIGURE OF COST PER BED- DANNY

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:44.748
NOT. REACHING THE PLACES WHERE

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.617
WE REALLY HAVE A CRISIS AND PUT

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.052
THE HIGH COST AREAS WHERE WE'RE

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:50.020
FINDING SOMETHING THAT'S BEFORE

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:50.521
WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.822
CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING.

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:52.823
AFFORDABLE IS MUCH MORE

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.193
DIFFICULT SO I WONDER IF YOU ANY

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.096
COMMENTS ON THAT- YEAH- SO JUST

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.899
TO CLARIFY- WE RANK USING COST

00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:04.234
PER BED ND FRIENDS- SO

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:06.603
PROVIDING EITHER IT SUCKS UP

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.604
SOME OF THE- APPLICANTS

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.807
ACTUALLY- PROPOSED PROVIDING

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.642
FRANK LOWER THAN ACTUALLY WHAT

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.944
WE HAD. A REQUIRED IN STATUTE-

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.813
AND SO THOSE PROJECTS WERE

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.848
RANKED HIGHER- IS THERE

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.216
PROVIDING THE MOST AFFORDABLE

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.718
RENTS FOR STUDENTS- SO IN TERMS

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:24.721
OF- YOU KNOW ORIGINAL METRIC- IT

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.224
WAS THAT WAS A- MORE DIFFICULT-

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.560
METRIC FOR US TO EVALUATE. AND-

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.196
THE LEGISLATURE IS A WELCOME TO

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.630
INCLUDE THAT WITHIN THEIR OWN

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.566
RECORD OF WITH THEIR OWN SPACE

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:38.635
THAT YOU'RE THEN GOING TO

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:40.637
APPROVED- WE BUT WE WANTED TO BE

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:41.672
MORE. METRIC AND ADDITIONALLY IT

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:42.473
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:44.675
REQUIRED IN STATUTE THAT WE HAD

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.243
PUT IN THERE- SO IT WASN'T

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.611
SOMETHING THAT- WE HAD

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:49.713
INITIALLY. PROPOSED PUT IN OUR

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.216
PROPOSAL IN OUR PROPOSED

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:53.884
RECOMMENDED. AND STRUCTURE. YEAH

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.352
I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT IF

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.221
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:58.856
EMPHASIZE AFFORDABILITY- THAT IS

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.991
A REACH AS OPPOSED TO JUST- A.

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.392
N. AND WE'RE PRETTY ONLY FOR

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:03.494
PROVIDING SOME CITY IT WAS

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.728
PREGNANT. AND I HAVEN'T STUDIED

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.930
THIS ISSUE AS CLOSE AS YOU ALL

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.565
BUT- IS STRUCK ME THAT THE ON

00:46:08.632 --> 00:46:09.800
CAMPUS VERSUS OFF CAMPUS RENT

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:12.002
COMPARISON. MIGHT GET- YOU TO

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.970
MORE ACCURATE THAT'S ONE OF

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:16.607
WHICH PARTICULAR CAMPUSES ARE OR

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:17.808
BEDS NEED MORE SUBSIDIES THAN

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.810
OTHERS. AND I THINK THAT WAS

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:21.378
MAYBE THAT I DON'T TO PUT WORDS

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.479
IN THE ALEJO'S MOUTH BUT THAT

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:24.948
THAT SEEMS TO BE. ONE OF THE

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.116
REASONS WE MIGHT CHOOSE THIS

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.951
APPROACH AND SO MAYBE THE L. A.

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:28.652
O. COULD COMMENT HERE'S WELL.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.988
RIGHT SO- RIGHT SO IF THEY

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:31.522
MINISTRATION CONSIDER TWO

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:33.357
METRICS AGAIN. A STATE COSTS FOR

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:35.392
AFFORDABLE BAN. SO FOR ALL THE

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:36.593
AFFORDABLE BAGS THAT WERE FILLED

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.162
IN A PROJECT THEY DIVIDED THE-

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:40.597
THE- PROPOSED ACOSTA NOT. GOT TO

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.466
IT. BECAUSE FOR AFFORDABLE THAT

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.234
METRIC. EXCLUDED BANDS THAT

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.436
WERE- MORE STANDARD WRENCH SOME

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:48.372
PROJECTS ARE A MIX OF AFFORDABLE

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:49.740
RENT BEDS AND STANDARDBRED BEDS.

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.008
ANOTHER IS THAT SECOND METRIC

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:52.609
THAT COMPARED THE PROPOSED RENTS

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.578
O THE STATUTORY LIMIT. AND ONE

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.580
OPTION WE- RECOMMEND TH

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.482
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. IS TO

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:01.718
COMPARE THE PROPOSED RENTS TO-

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:03.453
COMMUNITY RENTAL RATES AND THROW

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.022
OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. RATHER THAN

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:07.724
THE STATUTORY LIMIT. AND THE

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.660
PRIMARY VANTAGE WE SEE WITH THAT

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:10.627
IS THAT IT COULD ALLOW FOR A

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.129
LITTLE BIT. MORE PRECISE

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:14.264
RANKING- UNDER THE-

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.265
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH YOU

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:16.833
KNOW BECAUSE AT. LIKE HALF THE

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.735
ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. PROPOSED A

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.470
MAXIMUM STATUTORY RENTS WE

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:22.139
ALREADY COOLEY. AND SO THIS

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.440
WOULD ALLOW FOR A LITTLE MORE

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:24.708
FINE BREAKING. AYE YOU'RE ALSO

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.476
CORRECT THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:27.811
IT DOES SORT OF. EMPHASIZE AGAIN

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.680
THAT SERVE PORTABILITY AND THAT-

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.716
IT. REALLY COMPARES- THE

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:34.051
PROPOSED RENTS TO. A ROUGH

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:36.253
ESTIMATE OF WHAT. THEY'RE SORT

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:36.787
OF ALTERNATIVE IS IN THE

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:39.089
COMMUNITY. THAT COULD BE ANOTHER

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:40.691
GRAND OF CONSIDERING THAT TOO.

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:41.792
AND THEN IT JUST EMPHASIZED

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:42.993
DEPARTMENT FINANCES POINT-

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.795
THAT'S- WE- WE RECEIVE SOME

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.663
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM UC

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.699
AND CSU. ON THOSE ON THOSE RENTS

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.701
ARE AFTER THE INITIAL. LETTER

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:51.668
WAS SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.337
OF FINANCE. THE INFORMATION IS A

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.638
BILL AVAILABLE FOR USING THIS

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:57.207
YEAR'S YOU. THE COLLEGES ARE

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.575
MORE A LITTLE BIT. MORE VARIED

00:47:58.642 --> 00:47:59.776
AND WHETHER THEY CAN. THEY HAVE

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:00.644
THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.946
REPORT. ALSO THE ABILITY OF THE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:03.914
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THAT

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:05.282
APPROACH FOR THE COLLEGES MIGHT

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.750
BE ONE BUT IF. THANK YOU MISTER

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.719
**** CONSTANT TOROS AND I GUESS

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:10.721
I WOULD JUST- ARTICULATE MY OWN

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:12.356
PREFERENCE- AND I DON'T THAT

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:13.390
SHARED BY OTHER COMMITTEE

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:14.891
MEMBERS BUT- IF WE'RE- TO EXTENT

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.893
WE'RE PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.195
FOR HOUSING. I WOULD STRONGLY

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.830
PREFER TO SEE THAT- GO ENTIRELY

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.131
OR PREDOMINANTLY TOWARDS.

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:22.766
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE I THINK

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.369
THAT IS- THE ROLE AND IF IT MORE

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:34.378
MARKET RATE. HOUSING TO BE BUILT

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:35.979
I FEEL LIKE THAT OUGHT TO BE

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:38.115
THE- WITHIN OTHER FROM FINE

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:38.749
STREAMS THAT NOT FROM THIS ONE

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:41.084
TIME- I LAST. IS I CSU RAISED

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.886
POINT THAT- IF IT THE DISH OFTEN

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:43.553
CAME. THROUGH THAT YOU CERTAINLY

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.956
HAVE MORE. TO PROPOSE. I SUSPECT

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:49.626
YOU COULD COMMENT OR OR

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:50.594
DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA- HAS ANY

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.963

ARE WE TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.867

NOT INFINITE BUT WE DO HAVE A

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.371
SENSE OF WHAT YOUR- FUNDING.

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.839
NEEDS WOULD BE IF WE COULD JUST

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:06.576

PLANNING AT SOME POINT. ON WILL

CONSTRUCTION ALONE BASED ON WHAT

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:34.264
WE- KNOW NOW- DAY COMMUTE

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:37.167
COLLEGE NEED IS ABOUT ONE POINT

WOULD LATER GIVE US THAT DATA

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.578

RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE ENROLLMENT

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.334

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.621
LIKELY TAKE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:48.191
SO THE PLANS DON'T SEEM TO BE

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:51.127
HOLDING TOGETHER FROM A FISCAL

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:51.727
PERSPECTIVE. THANK UNDER ALSO

INCREASE- ACT WOULDN'T IT

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.747
WOULDN'T BE AT ISSUE. IT'S NOT

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.950
EVEN CLEAR THAT FOR GOING A

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:14.684
FUNDING INCREASE WOULD BE AN

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.285
APPROPRIATE REPERCUSSION THAT

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.687
MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.655
REVISIT THAT POLICY INTERVENTION

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.924
THE PROGRAM DESIGN REALLOCATE

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.926
EXISTING RESOURCE SAYS. IN SOME

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.494
INSTANCES A SEGMENT MIGHT EVEN

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.597
NEED MORE RESOURCES TO MEET

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.699
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS.

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.100
THINKING THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.802
REPERCUSSIONS FOR MISSING ANY

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.537
PARTICULAR EXPECTATION THAT'S

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:38.140
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME CAREFUL

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.542
DELIBERATION. WHAT ARE YOUR BUT

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.910
PLANS LIKE COMPAQ AND ROAD MAPS

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.945
THEY ALSO TEND TO GET OFF TRACK

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.680
THERE HASN'T BEEN A CONTACT IN

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.816
THE PAST THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.551
BE ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT THE

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.187
PERIOD AS PROPOSED. SOMETIMES

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.289
FISCAL CONDITIONS IMPROVE

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.291
SOMETIMES THEY WERE SON. LASTLY

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.026
OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN IS

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.928
THAT WHEN GOVERNOR'S AND GO

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.866
RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET PLANS

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:04.300
THEY SIDESTEPPED THE

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.535
LEGISLATURE. THOUGH AS PART OF

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.237
THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS ONE OF

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.639
THE MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR THE

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.841
LEGISLATURE IS TO WORK WITH THE
