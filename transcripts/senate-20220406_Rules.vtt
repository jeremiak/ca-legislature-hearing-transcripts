THIS POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.736
REALLY LOOKING AT THE DATA

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:12.304
LOOKING AT WHO ARE THE MEMBERS

WE GO UPSTREAM TO DESIGN. AN

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.758
ENVIRONMENT DESIGNED SYSTEMS

OTHER STRATEGIES THAT ARE

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.076
OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL. THAT

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:53.512
HAS EXISTED AND- OF WHILE YOU

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.681
JUST MADE THE CASE FOR WHY

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.149

IS- I THINK VERY DARING- AN

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.311
INTERESTING. AND ALSO WILL

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.746

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:50.246

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.530
THINGS SO CONTINUE TO PROCESS

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:08.998
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.633
CARE COURT IN PARTICULAR WHAT I

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.769
WILL SAY THERE IS THAT I THINK

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.537
THAT WE HAVE FAILED THESE

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:16.039
INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT I WILL JUST

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.841
START WITH IS THAT. THIS ISN'T

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.143
FOR ALL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:22.712
THIS ISN'T INTENDED TO BE FOR

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.447
ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE MENTAL

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.916
UNLESS BUT RATHER FOR THOSE WHO

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.052
HAVE SEVERE SCHIZOPHRENIC

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:31.954
DISORDERS OR PSYCHE AS AT A

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.589
PARTICULAR SMALL GROUP OF

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.090
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THAT

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.726
CATEGORY. AND IT IS GOING TO

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.327
TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:41.030
HOLISTICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.999
WE DO NOT PLAY HOT POTATO WITH

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.967
THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE LOOK

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.470
AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.538
THE HOLISTIC NEEDS THAT THEY

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.273
HAVE AND THE WAYS THAT WE

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.274
ALTERNATELY WRAP OURSELVES

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.910
AROUND THEM. I TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.645
THEY ARE ON A TRAJECTORY THAT

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.447
AVOIDS CONSERVATORSHIP AND

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.849
AVOIDS INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.485
IS TOO EASY TO GET TO THOSE

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.653
POINTS AND THEN ACTUALLY RECEIVE

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.022
THE NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH CARE

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.457
WHAT ALSO WILL SAY IS THAT I'M

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.225
THIS IS A FRAMEWORK. CAN WE PUT

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.927
OUT A FRAMEWORK WITH THE IDEA

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.895
THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT OF

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.464
CONVERSATION WITH A LOT OF

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.364
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS FOR US TO

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.266
UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF WHAT

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.535
THIS REALLY WILL MEAN ON THE

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.470
GROUND. TOO OFTEN WE PUT

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.071
TOGETHER IDEAS IN THEORY HERE IN

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.373
SACRAMENTO BUT WE TEND TO NOT

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.741
REALIZE ALL THE PRACTICAL

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.610
IMPLICATIONS ON THE GROUND AND

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.645
SO WE HAVE PUT OUT A PROPOSAL OR

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.147
CONCEPT FOR A FRAMEWORK WITH THE

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.882
IDEA THAT WE ENGAGE IN DEEP AND

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.517
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION WITH OUR

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.552
COUNTY PARTNERS ARE CIVIL RIGHTS

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.620
PARTNERS OTHERS. IN THE

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:38.855
COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:39.689
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:42.091
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS I THINK

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:44.427
WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND WE LOOK

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:45.561
FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:46.195
CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.530
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.132
DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS AS WE

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:51.100
CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS A PATH

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:54.937
OF ADOPTING. THIS PARTICULAR

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.839
PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT-

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:59.675
YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE SPENT.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.445
NOT ENOUGH TIME. AND KNOWLEDGE

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:05.515
IN. HOW POVERTY HOW MENTAL

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.850
HEALTH HOW ACCESS TO CARE OR

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:10.119
LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE OVER

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.888
EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. HOW

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.656
THAT TRULY DOES AFFECT NOT JUST

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.424
INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO FAMILIES

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.226
AND COMMUNITIES. AND THE STOP

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:20.263
GAP SHOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW THE

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.364
CRIMINAL COURTS. WE SHOULD BE

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.166
GOING BACK TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:25.134
ABOUT WHAT REAL HOLISTIC.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.503
PREVENTATIVE CARE LOOKS LIKE- SO

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.805

VULNERABLE. AND SO PART OF THAT

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.320
WORK IS THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.256

IS. ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE WE

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.025
CANNOT ALLOW THESE YOUNG FOLKS

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.127
TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS- AND

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.229

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:37.700
pAT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.702

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.336
SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.672
THEY NEED. I WOULD JUST MY FINAL

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:44.674
QUESTION IS- JUST TO THE

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.542
UNDERSECRETARY AND I KNOW THAT-

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:50.413
CAL HHS HAS TWO KEY STRATEGIES.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.848
TO SUPPORT- THE COUNCIL ON

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.717
HOMELESSNESS IS COLLECTIVE WORK

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.520
AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIES IS

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:58.654
INCREASING THE LEVEL OF

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.222
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND VISIBILITY

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:03.592
OF THE HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENT.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.428
AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:07.530
DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU BECAUSE WE

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.732
SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.600
HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.202

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.240
THAT WE'RE GIVING IT GRANTS AND

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.877
CAMMING GRANTS ETCETERA ETCETERA

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:24.280
BUT PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO KNOW.

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.549
THE BANG FOR THE BUCK- AND THE

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.551
VISIBILITY OF WHAT WE ARE

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:32.121
GIVING. OUT TO OUR PARTNERS AND

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.556

WORK THAT YOU DO WHAT DOES THAT

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:40.363
MEAN TO YOU. I THINK THIS IS OUR

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:41.464
AND THIS IS AN EXCELLENT

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.131
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.499
HOMELESSNESS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.768
IS IN OUR FACE ON A DAILY BASIS.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.002
I YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.038
AND SEE OUR OWN NEIGHBORS WHO

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:51.040
ARE HOMELESS AND STUFF FOR US I

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.409
THINK THAT THE THING HERE IS

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.277
THAT WE ARE WE ARE PART OF THIS

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.246

AS THAT INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.651
HOMELESSNESS AND THE IDEA AROUND

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:04.387
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:06.956
IS REALLY THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:08.724
EACH OTHER'S PROGRAMS AND

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.693
DOLLARS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.861
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.496
INDIVIDUALS WERE TRYING TO

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:14.797
SERVE. I TAKE THAT A STEP

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.365
FURTHER AND ENSURING THAT WE

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.666
HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY AND

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.201
INSIGHTS ON HOW DOLLARS ARE

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.504

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.805
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO

ENSURE THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.108
WITH REGARDS TO HOW THESE

PROGRAMS ARE DELIVERED AT THE

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:28.944
LOCAL GROUND BECAUSE WHAT WORKS

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.946
IN SAN DIEGO MAY NOT ORK IN

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.848

THERE HAS TO BE IN A LOT AYE AYE

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.085

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.435
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE YOUR FOCUS

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.402
WITH THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.471
WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:43.839
MY OPINION IT COMPLETELY

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.674
UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS. IN THE

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:49.311
REVIEW AT THE. VALENCIA BRANCH

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.747
LAB. THE FIRST I OF. YOU ASKING

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.482
ME THIS QUESTION AND IT'S

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.584
UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE I MADE MADE

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:57.519
MYSELF AVAILABLE TO YOUR STAFF

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.321
AS WELL AS THE REPUBLICAN STAFF

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.557
ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. AND HAVE

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:02.891
ALSO ANSWERED ALL QUESTIONS THAT

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:05.628
HAVE BEEN SENT MY WAY. I ALSO AM

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.496
EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.098
BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:10.599
VALENCIA LAB I THINK THERE'S A

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.501
LOT OF MISINFORMATION AROUND THE

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.403
VALENCIA LAB IN PARTICULAR. BUT

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.205
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.340
AND OTHERS WERE WATCHING TODAY

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.275
FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:23.145
WE DAD AND HOW IT IS THAT WE DID

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.780
AT. THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.583
WAS A DELAY IN TERMS I HAVE. HAD

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.684
THEIR THE REVIEW IN THE REPORT

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.119
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.354
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HAVE. A

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.756
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT WAS

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.724
INDEPENDENT WE ASKED NOT ONLY

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.826
OUR OWN INVESTIGATORS TO GO WHEN

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.461
WE ASKED A THIRD PARTY

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.963
ACCREDITING BODY TO GO IN. AND

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.731
WE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.900
GO IN AND TO REVIEW ALL THREE

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.468
CAME BACK AND CLEARED THE

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.437
LABORATORY. I SO I WANT TO MAKE

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.272
SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. THE

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.174
DELAY WASN'T BECAUSE WE WERE

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.542
HIDING ANYTHING BUT RATHER WE

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.411
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.378
WAS MULTIPLE LAYERS INDEPENDENT

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.113
OF OURS. REVIEWING THE

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.748
LABORATORIES BUSINESS TO MAKE

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.617
SURE THAT IT WAS RIGHT. THE

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.785
OTHER THING THAT I WILL SAY

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.753
SENATOR IS THAT THE GOAL HERE

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.355
WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARKET AND TO

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.257
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:09.825
TESTING. UNDERSERVED

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:11.493
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.828
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:15.264
THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC MORE

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.732
THAN 50% OF THE SPECIMENS

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.901
COLLECTED AND PROCESSED AT THIS

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.070
LABORATORY. CAME FROM LOW INCOME

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.671
NEIGHBORHOODS IN DISTRICTS FROM

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.040
ALL OF YOU ARE AT THE DIETS

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:26.842
ADDITIONALLY WE WERE ABLE TO

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.811
RECOUP ALL OF THE DOLLARS THAT

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.479
WE SPEND FROM EITHER FEMA OR

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.448
INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:33.916
OF THE TESTING THAT WE DID AT

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.651
THE LABORATORY AND MORE

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.253
IMPORTANTLY ALL FOUR SEARCHES

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.022
ARE FIVE SURGES THAT WE'VE HAD.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:42.658
THIS LABORATORY HAS BEEN THE TOP

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.826
PERFORMING ONE OF THE TOP

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.561
PERFORMING VOLUME LABORATORIES

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:49.765
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:50.866
THERE WAS A LOT OF UP AND DOWN

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.035
WITH REGARDS THIS AT THE VERY

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.237
BIG.I THINK THAT THERE WAS- A

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.605
LOT OF MISINFORMATION- IN

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.273
REGARDS TO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.175
AT THE LABORATORY BUT I WILL SAY

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:01.543
THIS UNEQUIVOCALLY I AM

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.212
EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:04.413
BEEN ABLE TO DO. AT THE

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.482
BEGINNING OF THIS ENDEAVOR THERE

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.917
WAS ONLY THE ABILITY TO DO TWO

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.419
THOUSAND TAX A DAY TO DAY

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.020
THERE'S A COMMERCIAL CAPACITY

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.522
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.923
OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.458
PER DAY. WAS IT PERFECT

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.160
ABSOLUTELY NOT COULD WE HAVE

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:21.296
DONE A BETTER YES BUT WE WERE IN

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:21.830
THE MIDST OF A WORLDWIDE

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:22.898
PANDEMIC. AND OUR GOAL HERE WAS

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:25.501
TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES AND WE DID

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.402
EXACTLY THAT. THANK YOU AND I

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.404
AND I APOLOGIZE I CUT JUST THE

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.206
FIRST PART OF IT BUT NOT THE

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:32.608
LAST PART YOU SAID IT WAS

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:34.777

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.116
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING ME- NO

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:41.750
SENATOR HAD APOLOGIZED FOR THE

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.352
WHOLE PLAN WAS TO DISRUPT THE

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.087
MARKET TO REDUCE THE COST OF

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:45.954
TESTING. ANDMAKE SURE THAT

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.456
THERE WAS ADDITIONAL PLAYERS

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.524
THAT CAME INTO THE COMMERCIAL

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.793
MARKET. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.394
ABLE TO EXPAND TESTING SO WHAT

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.463
WE DECIDED TO DO THIS PARTICULAR

ENDEAVOR WE WENT INTO IT WITH

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.100

INDIVIDUALS CAN GET ACCESS TO IT

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.042
BUT THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN COULD

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.344
HAVE ACCESS TO TESTING. OKAY I

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:10.279

SUPPORT AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:57.479
SUPPORT- I THINK THE ROLLOUT HAS

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:58.113
BEEN SLOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.415
BECAUSE IT IS A NEW THING FOR.

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:02.050
THE REGIONAL CENTERS.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.518
IMPLEMENTED AND THEY ARE NOT

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:04.987
ALWAYS COMFORTABLE WITH HOW TO

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.355
DO IT. AND I THINK IT'S

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:08.090
INCUMBENT ON THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.257
US. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.360
AND ALSO PUSH THEM TO ROLL IT

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.395
OUT. ONE THING THAT ISN'T AN

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.463
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PROGRAM

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.798
IS HAVING SOMEONE. WHO CAN DO.

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:18.700
PERFORM THE FINANCIAL WORK FOR

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:19.568
THE CONSUMER THEIR FAMILY AND

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.336
THAT. THAT'S NOT AN EASY JOB AND

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:23.038
I THINK WE- PROBABLY NEED TO

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:23.939
FOCUS MORE ON SUPPORTING THE

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:24.973
REGIONAL CENTERS TO MAKE SURE

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.975
THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN PLACE. FOR

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.076
THE CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.478
REALLY ARE COMFORTABLE.

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:30.512
UNDERSTANDING THE CHOICES

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:32.047
THEY'RE MAKING AND HOW THEIR

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:34.316
THEIR SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.484
PROVIDED. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.985
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT SERVICE

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.920
WE WANT TO SUCCEED. I APPRECIATE

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.455
THAT COMMENT I WAS ACTUALLY IN

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.024
THE ASSEMBLY WHEN THAT BILL WAS

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.126
. BEFORE AVENUE. AT THE

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:46.361

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:47.896
OF THE COMMENTS IN THERE AT THAT

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.898
WERE BASED ON IN THAT COMMITTEE

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.166

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.936

IT WAS SOMETHING AMENDMENTS

01:17:56.605 --> 01:17:58.106
CONTINUE TO HAD TO BE TAKEN SO

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.241
THAT WE COULD HAVE SELF

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:00.675
DETERMINATION SO. PARENTS DID

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.878
HAVE THE RIGHTS. AND TO MAKE

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.579
THOSE DETERMINATIONS FOR THEIR

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:05.447
CHILDREN THAT WERE DEVELOPED

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.282
REALLY DISABLED. AND SO I WAS

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.084

I DO WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE. I

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.101
DEVELOPED THAT'S REALLY GOING TO

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.936
BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THE GOALS

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.671
THAT ARE PROMISE THERE. I LOOKED

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:11.439
AT THE BUDGET- THAT THE

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:12.741
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IS ONE

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:14.676
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.311
THREE YEARS. OF FOR THE

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:17.846
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND WHEN I

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:18.947
WENT DOWN THAT LIST MARK

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.649
WILLIAMS. I NOTICED THAT THE

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.450
PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENT TRAINING

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:25.187
PROGRAM. WAS THE- NOT THE LEAST

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.855
BIT IT WAS LOW ON THE ON THE-

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.224
THING AND IT IS REALLY. THOSE

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.725
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:33.428
REALLY LACKING. THEY WHEN A

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.363
PERSON ARRIVES AND EMERGENCY OF

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.132
THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND- THE

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.701
TRIAGE THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.369
PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY THEY'RE

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:42.237
SERVING. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:46.041
VERY IMPORTANT- IN THIS PROGRAM.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.776
SO DO YOU WILL YOU HAVE ANY.

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:51.246
OPPORTUNITY THE LETTER TO DO. ON

THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO MAKE A

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:54.249
DIFFERENCE THERE AFTER YOU DO AN

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:56.151
ASSESSMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.819
PARTICULAR AREA. REALLY NEEDS.

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.688
MORE RESOURCES AND I THINK

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:00.455
THAT'S WHAT OUR BEHAVIORAL

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.357
HEALTH. OF FOLKS ARE CONCERNED

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:03.858
ABOUT WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO BE

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:06.394
RUNNING ARC- COUNTY AGENCIES. IN

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:07.662
RECEIVING IMPLEMENTING THE

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:13.368

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:21.843
TELL YOU YOU'RE CORRECT THAT I

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.144
THINK THAT WE COULD DO

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.512
ABSOLUTELY MORE AND I THINK

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:25.347
WORKFORCE MORE BROADLY. ACROSS

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:26.648
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.049
PARTICULARLY IN BABY HAVE

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:29.584
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS AN

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.452
IMPORTANT ASPECT. THAT THAT ONE

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.020
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.588
PROPOSAL WAS DESIGNED TO BUILD

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.056
ON TOP OF PRIOR INVESTMENTS THAT

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.558
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.893
MADE. AND ONE AREA THAT I WILL

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.029
POINT YOU TO IS OUR CHILDREN AND

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:41.563
YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:42.597
INITIATIVES WHERE WE HAVE

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.399
SPECIFIC WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.401
BEING MADE. TO BUILD UP THE WORK

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.136
FORCE AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.771
AND SO THERE IS ADDITIONAL

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:51.072
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.008
COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.709
I BY INCREASING RESIDENCY

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:57.212
PROGRAMS BY CREATING PIPELINES

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:57.912
THAT ARE PROGRAMSTHAT CHECK

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.282
TRACKS THAT ARE INTENDED TO

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.816
BUILD ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:03.652
NOT BE DUPLICATIVE SO WHAT WE

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.220
TRY TO DO WITH THE ONE POINT

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:06.554
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL.

WE FIND AND AREN'T UP AND GOING

01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:20.268

MAKE SURE THAT WE X. RAYED. MAKE

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.805

REACH OUT TO YOU BUT IT IS AN

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.549
AREA THAT I THINK OF A CRITICAL

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:42.884
IN TERMS OF US REALLY ARE DOING

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.152

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.820
END HOMELESSNESS AND WE'RE GOING

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.155
TO REDUCE ALL WOULD BE GREAT IF

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:49.057
WE COULD REDUCE IT TO ZERO. OUT

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.526
OF A LOFTY GOAL OF COURSE BUT

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.328

THEY HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.669
I DO BELIEVE THAT TOM MY

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:04.205

HOMELESSNESS AND- LET ME START

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.491
WITH THE UNDERSECRETARY AND SEE

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:05.627
IF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY WANTS TO

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:08.663
CHIME IN. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.932
PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING TO ADDRESS

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:12.667
STATEWIDE PROBLEMS FROM

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.602
SACRAMENTO WHERE IT IS REALLY

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.838
DIFFERENT AND TO. TAKE A LEAF

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.506
OUT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.341
BAKERSFIELD'S OF BOOK WHAT ME

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:24.779
ASK A DISTRICT RELATED QUESTION

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.447
AND THAT IS THAT. YOUR WE SOME

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.249
CITIES IN MY DISTRICT WITH

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:31.452
HOMELESS POPULATIONS. THE ON A

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:39.060
PER CAPITA. SORT OF DOLES OUT.

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.462
MONEY ON A PER CAPITA BASIS OF

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.864
SOME OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE AN

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:45.600
OVERWHELMING IMPACT CAN'T GET IN

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.603
FRONT OF THE ISSUE. IT ONE YEAR

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:49.737
IN SACRAMENTO AND YOU'RE LOOKING

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:52.006
AT TRYING TO ADDRESS THINGS TO

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:55.677
YOU. DOES THAT COME ACROSS TO

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.378
YOU IS THAT SOMETHING YOU TRY TO

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.447
COMPENSATE FOR HOW YOU'D

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:02.116
MINISTER THE PROGRAMS. SENATOR

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:03.217
THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.086
FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK ONE

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.255
PRINCIPLE THAT I OFTEN TELL OUR

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.091
TEAM IS THAT. WE REALLY HAVE TO

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:12.727
THINK ABOUT OUR POLICY IDEAS IN

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:14.062
THEORY BUT THEN WE NEED TO

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.930
REALLY TEST THEM AND UNDERSTAND

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:17.732
THEM IN PRACTICE AND WHAT DO I

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:19.567
MEAN BY THAT. IT MEANS THAT WE

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.002
NEED TO GET INTO THE GROUND AND

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.604
YOUR STAND WHAT ARE STAKEHOLDERS

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.572
AND PARTNERS REALLY THINK ABOUT

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:25.640
IT BECAUSE IN SACRAMENTO HERE WE

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:27.141
MIGHT HAVE THIS NOVEL IDEA

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.943
AROUND X. Y. NZ BUT THEN WE GET

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.812
ON THE GROUND AND WE REALIZED.

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:32.080
WELL THAT REALLY IN PRACTICE

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:34.315
DOESN'T WORK AND SO I THINK WHAT

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:36.050
WE'VE TRIED TO DO OR WHAT I'M

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:37.518
TRYING TO SHOW BY EXAMPLE IS

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.187
REALLY HOW DO WE GET INTO THE

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.755
COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:41.923
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES OF OUR

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:44.058
COMMUNITIES. AND ONE BEAUTIFUL

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.526
THING ABOUT THE STATE IS THAT WE

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.129
ARE BIG AND DIVERSE AND SO PART

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.964
OF IT IS THAT EACH LOCALITY IS

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.733
GONNA HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.135
AND ONE THING THAT WE ARE TRYING

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:56.604
TO STRIVE FOR IS HOW DO YOU GIVE

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:57.472
PEOPLE FLEXIBILITY WHILE STILL

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.741
AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING SURE

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.175
THAT WE'RE HOLDING PEOPLE LOOK

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:02.243
PAUL AND THAT WE'RE BEING

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:04.445
TRANSPARENT ABOUT PROCESS FEEDS

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.481
ON THAT PARTICULAR TOPIC AROUND

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:08.349
HOMELESSNESS THE VAST MAJORITY

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:10.351
OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:11.586
ADMINISTERED BY OUR COLLEAGUES

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:12.954
AT THE BUSINESS CONSUMER

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.422
SERVICES IN HOUSING AGENCY WHERE

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.457
WE COME INTO PLAY HOW DO WE

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:18.159
THINK ABOUT. OUR HEALTH BEING

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.361
PART OF HOUSING HOW DO WE THINK

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.963
ABOUT WRAPPING AROUND THE SOCIAL

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.132
SERVICES PROGRAMS AND THE HEALTH

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:26.134
PROGRAMS IN A HOLISTIC WAY SO

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.169
THAT WHEN YOU HOW SOMEONE THAT

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:29.504
YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:31.139
SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN STATE

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:34.942
HOUSE OR IF THEY'RE ON THE BRINK

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.611
OF BECOMING HOMELESS SAYS. THAT

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.413
WE REALLY HAVE TO SERVE. I'M

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.348
THEM SO THAT. I'M HOME. AND SO I

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:42.717
THINK FOR SERVICE ME. I TO YOUR

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.052
YOUR DIRECT QUESTION IT'S ALL A-

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:46.521
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:49.023
ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES AND OUR

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.125
IDEAS IN SACRAMENTO. I'D GET

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:53.061
TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE IN A

01:28:53.127 --> 01:28:55.063
MEANINGFUL WAY AND I THINK PART

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.098
OF THAT IS. BEING WILLING TO

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.167
TAKE REST AND PART OF THAT IS

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:00.401
BEING WILLING TO ITERATE

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.103
CONSTANTLY. IT'S OKAY IF

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.538
SOMETHING DOESN'T GO AS WE

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.406
PLANNED BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.408
TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ARE JUST.

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:08.843
SO THAT WE CAN CORRECT AND

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:11.312
ADDRESS THAT CHALLENGE OR THAT

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.281
ISSUE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:14.115
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:16.384
QUESTION DOES WHAT I THINK IT IN

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:17.018
THE INTEREST OF HAVING A

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:21.489
CONVERSATION. A. R. WOULD JUST

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.924
SORT OF SAY ON THE GROUND. THE

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.692
MARKET IN THE TOWN WHERE I USED

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:27.328
TO BE MAYOR YEARS AGO AND THEY

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:28.129
HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.098
POPULATION COMPARED TO THE URBAN

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:33.234
AREAS. THE LARGEST PROGRAM YES

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.169
THEY DO. OVERNIGHT SHELTER THEY

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:38.005
DO FAMILY SHELTER THEIR SHOWERS

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:39.107
THE AND THEY HAVE ALL THESE

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.109
THINGS BUT THEY ALSO HAVE. AN

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.910
OUTPATIENT CLINIC THAT PEOPLE

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:44.078
CAN ACCESS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:46.314
THERE. THEY HAVE BEDS FOR PEOPLE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:48.416
COMING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. SO

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:49.984
THAT THEY CAN HAVE A REHAB PLACE

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.452
AND NOT GOING TO THE STREET

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.454
AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM THE

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.522
HOSPITAL. THEY EVEN FOR A LONG

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.524
PERIOD OF TIME HAD LOCKED. A

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:59.260
LOCKED FACILITY FOR THINGS THAT

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:01.262
WERE RELATED THERE. THEY HAD

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:02.864
ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.732
TREATMENT. ALL THOSE THINGS

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.467
MIGHT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:08.736
YOUR DEPARTMENT EVEN THOUGH. THE

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:11.305
SUBJECT OF HOUSING IS OVER AND-

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:13.141
OF THE BUSINESS AGENCY HOW DO

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.542
YOU ACTUALLY COORDINATE FOR

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.277
THOSE HOLISTIC WRAPAROUND

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.111
SERVICES SINCE YOU'RE

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.680
RESPONSIBLE. FOR SOME OF THE

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:20.882
FUNDING STREAMS THAT MIGHT TIED

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:23.451
TO THOSE THINGS. THAT FIT IN

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:23.985
THAT LARGER CONTINUUM OF

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.888
SERVICES. BUT I THINK THIS IS AN

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.289
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:29.924
I'M GREAT PART OF THE

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:31.392
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK.

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:32.660
FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK WE

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:34.729
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.030
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BASED ON

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.965
THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE NOT BASED

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.233
ON. STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.103
THAT DOESN'T MATTER THAT I THAT

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.205
I SERVICE IS BEING DELIVERED BY

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.106
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.308
SERVICES OR SOCIAL SERVICES OR-

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:51.546
PARTNER. SERVICE AND ABOUT AND A

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:55.116
MATTER IS. VISUAL FRIEND OF. TOM

01:30:55.183 --> 01:31:02.790
AT. A B. ALSO THIS AND WE- A

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.226
MATTER. THEM TO ONE AND HAVE US

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.127
AROUND THEM TO THE CHALLENGE

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:08.896
HERE TO VERY FOR IN ON WITH YOU.

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:11.132
IS THE WAY FIND IS OUT OF BOTH

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:11.799
THE STATE LEVEL BUT- A THE

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.634
FEDERAL. IT'S BAY ON. ARE PIECE

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.036
AND WHAT WE TRYING DO AND

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.170
DIRECTOR BOSS ALLUDED TO THIS

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.104
AROUND OUR WORKAROUND CAL AIMS

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:19.040
SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.208
DOING AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.042
CONTINUUM. AND COMMUNITY CARE

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:21.976
EXPANSIONS IS REALLY FIGURING

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.344
OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE BLANDON

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:26.280
PARADE DOLLARS IN ORDER FOR US

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:28.049
TO SERVE THE INDIVIDUAL. IN A

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:30.318
MORE HOLISTIC WAY ON THE GROUND

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:32.286
SO. FOR US IT'S LESS ABOUT

01:31:32.353 --> 01:31:34.222
WHETHER OR NOT HAVE SOMEONE HAS

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:36.457
DIABETES OR HIV AND AIDS BUT

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.226
REALLY WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS AND

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:40.294
THEN HOW DO WE WRAP AROUND THEM.

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.563
IN A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC WAY AND

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.298
THAT IS HARD THAT IS QUARTER

01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:45.733
CHANGE BOARD AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.068
AND THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:49.203
WE'RE SO ACCUSTOMED. TO DOING

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:50.972
THINGS AND BUCKETS AND WE'RE

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:52.373
ACCUSTOMED TO SAYING LET US

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.742
TREAT ACTS AND ARTISTRY WHY

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:56.644
RATHER THAN SAYING- HOW DO WE

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:58.179
LOOK AT YOU AND IN TOTAL AND A

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.214
GOOD EXAMPLE HERE IS. YOU CAN

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.716
PROVIDE SOMEONE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:03.084
COVERAGE YOU CAN PROVIDE A CHILD

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.052
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.621
THROUGH MEDICAID OR COVERED

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:08.222
CALIFORNIA THEY MAY GO TO A

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:09.056
DOCTOR. THEY MAY GET A

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:10.725
PRESCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIBIOTIC

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:11.959
BUT IF THAT KID DOESN'T HAVE

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.861
FOOD ON THE TABLE OR A ROOF OVER

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.396
THEIR HEAD. THAT NOT ANTIBIOTIC

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:17.231
REALLY DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:19.033
AND SO FOR US IT'S ABOUT HOW DO

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.768
WE BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:21.702
DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITHIN OUR

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.738
OWN ORGANIZATION. AND THEN MORE

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.139
IMPORTANTLY HOW DO WE PUSH

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.374
FUNDING DOWN TO THE LOCAL

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.709
PARTNERS TO BE MORE HOLISTIC

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.244
AROUND THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.946
ONE BIG COMPONENT OF THAT IS OUR

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:34.048
WORK. PLAN WHICH DIRECTOR BASS

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.216
REALLY TALKED ABOUT IN GREAT

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.851
DEPTH. IN IT AND SINCE WE'RE

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:38.853
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IT

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.455
CALLS TO MIND- I RAN AN AIDS

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:44.225
SERVICE AGENCY AT THE HEIGHT OF

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:45.693
THE EPIDEMIC. AND I REMEMBER ONE

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.530
APPLICATION FOR HOUSING WHERE

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:50.698
ONE TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:55.870
DOLLAR GRANT. AND. THERE WAS AN

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.838
INCH. OF TYRAEL STATE I HAD FILE

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.740
THAT WERE ON. BE ARC. IN THAT IS

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.542
WHAT I HEAR FROM THE NONPROFIT

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:02.877
ACROSS MY DISTRICT ON A WHOLE

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.278
HOST OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:06.347
SERVICES THANKS THAT. THAT IT

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.150
REALLY IMPLIES. THE CAPACITY. IN

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:10.718
WHEN I WAS AT RESOURCES WE WOULD

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.620
HAVE THIS ON LAND CONSERVATION

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:14.221
AND SO WE WOULD DO A THING.

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:16.190
WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT A ONE PAGE

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.926
LETTER OF INTENT AND THEN JUDGE.

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:19.794
WHETHER THERE WAS A REAL

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.929
APPLICATION HERE AND THEN TRY TO

01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:23.297
WORK WITH THEM ON THE CAPACITY

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:25.366
TO GET IT DONE SO THEY WEREN'T

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:26.600
INITIALLY SCREENED OUT. BY THE

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:29.070
BASIS OF THEIR CAPACITY. DO YOU

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.604
KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.306
DEALING ACROSS THE STATE WITH

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:36.277
MAYBE SMALLER ENTITIES THAT.

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.445
THAT ENGAGE WITH YOUR AGENCY.

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.946
SENATOR YOU COULDN'T OF SAID I

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.781
COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER I

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:41.849
THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON AND I THINK

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:44.785
PART OF OUR WORK NEEDS TO BEAND

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:45.920
IT CONTINUES TO BE. HOW DO WE

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.388
KIND OF CREATE ARE THE ABILITY

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:48.923
FOR US NOT TO HAVE THE OVERLY

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.725
CUMBERSOME PROCESS FEES FOR

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.360
NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND OTHER

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.928
ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING BUSINESS

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:55.162
WITH PASSED. TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.031
ENGAGE WITH US AND I THINK TOO

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.767
OFTEN WE SCREEN OUT FOLKS OR WE

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.769
DON'T OUT WE LOOK AT PEOPLE

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:03.704
BASED ON EXPERIENCE BUT NOT ON

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.739
APTITUDES ARE CHARACTERISTICS

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:06.040
THAT WILL MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.575
IN PARTICULAR. OUT ROLE OR

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.977
RESPONSIBILITY AND SO I WHAT YOU

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:11.846
JUST SAID IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.581
TRYING TO DO ACROSS ALL TWELVE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.082
DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:17.451
WITHIN THE AGENCY. REALLY TRYING

01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:19.320
TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DELIVER

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:20.755
BETTER GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.990
REAL TIME AND THEN MORE

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:24.558
IMPORTANTLY WE CAN ADJUST ACT

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:27.194
ROCK MORE RAP. H. R. IN ORDER

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.196
FOR US TO ADAPT BUT I THINK WHAT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.664
ENDS UP HAPPENING TOO OFTEN IS

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:32.833
THAT WE'RE SO RISK AVERSE. ADD

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.668
THAT IN IT REALLY STIFLES OUR

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.303
ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND THINK

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.039
OUTSIDE THE BOX AND WHAT I'M

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.673
TRYING TO PUSH THE TEAM ON. IS

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.509
REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:43.511
REALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE FASTER

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:46.480
QUICKER. AND LEARN IN REAL TIME

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:48.382
I JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:49.250
COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC I MEAN

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.218
IF ANYTHING WE LEARNED FROM THIS

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:52.787
IS THAT COVERED HAS BEEN SUCH A

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:54.422

OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR CALL

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:01.228

HOSPICE AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.048
SO VULNERABLE AND SO IF THERE

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:07.412
INVESTIGATION UNDERTAKEN TO SEE

DOING BETTER IN THE FUTURE. I

02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:21.860
THINK IT'S THAT KIND OF REALLY

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:23.428
DEEP THINKING- THAT ALLOWS FOR

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:24.696
THE COMMISSION TO TRULY PLAYED A

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:27.399
ROLE IN DEEPENING CALIFORNIA'S

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:29.534
RESILIENCE TRAFFIC OFFENSE- I

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:31.069
LISTEN TO SOME AMAZING BUNKERS

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:32.437
THE OTHER DAY TALK ABOUT

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:34.539
RESILIENCE AND HOW. HOW THAT

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.641
WORD CAN ACTUALLY. NUMBER

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:39.310
HOWEVER OR OR ALLOW FOR US TO

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.146
USE SITE OUTSIDE OF OUR-

02:18:41.212 --> 02:18:43.348
RESPONSIBILITY TO ACTUALLY BE

02:18:43.415 --> 02:18:45.817
THERE TO PICK UP THOSE PROGRAMS

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:48.486
JUST TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.288
ARE ARE IN FACT. RECOVERY AFTER

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:52.123
THESE EVENTS AND- AND TO ENSURE

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:54.359
ALSO THAT WE ARE MORE PREPARED

02:18:54.426 --> 02:18:55.860
FOR FUTURE EVENTS AND I THINK

02:18:55.927 --> 02:18:58.563
IT'S THAT IDEA- UNDERSTANDING

02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:59.831
THAT RESILIENCE ISN'T SOMETHING

02:18:59.898 --> 02:19:00.965
THAT WE CAN JUST PUT ON A

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:02.434
COMMUNITY AFTER AN ADVENTIST

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.902
HAPPENED BUT RESILIENCE IS

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:05.837
ACTUALLY BUILT. WHEN WE ARE

02:19:05.904 --> 02:19:08.373
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:09.874
AND HONORING THE SUFFERING THE-

02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:12.110
FONT CARE. AND VERY CLEARLY

02:19:12.177 --> 02:19:13.578
ARTICULATING WHAT ARE THOSE

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:15.413
LESSONS LEARNED AND ONLY THEN

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.148
ARE WE ABLE TO BUILD THAT

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.850
RESIDENTS ITSELF. I AM I AM

02:19:18.917 --> 02:19:20.118
REALLY MOVED BY THE ASSAM WORK

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.953
PRODUCT OF THE COMMISSION- WITH

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.088
VERY LITTLE RESOURCES IN THE

02:19:23.154 --> 02:19:25.056
PAST AND TO BRING THAT KIND OF

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:27.092
WORK PRODUCT TO THE STATE- AND I

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:28.727
AND I THINK THAT IT SPENDING A

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:30.628
VERY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT- AND

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:32.530
STRUCTURAL SHIFTS AT AGAIN HOW

02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:34.833
THE COMMISSION SECOND SIDE OF.

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:42.607
YES MARIN- BECAUSE IN THAT. WAY

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:43.875
THAT KIND OF THOUGHTFULNESS AND

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.477
NOT. AND- I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:47.212
ANYONE USE THE WORD POSTMORTEM

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:47.846
BECAUSE THAT TO TWO MORE. THIS

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:49.581
PARTICULAR SAID. BUT ABILITY TO

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:51.015
LOOK BACK. ON TO LEARN. FROM THE

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:52.817
EVENTS AND TO LIFT UP THE

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:54.452
EXPERIENCES OF THE SPECIFIC

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:56.187
COMMUNITIES- RICH CREEK BRIDGE

02:19:56.254 --> 02:19:58.056
WEST. PRESSED EARTHQUAKE

02:19:58.123 --> 02:19:59.924
OCCURRED IN A VERY LITTLE PART

02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:02.527
OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW THAT.

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:04.162
ARE REAL CALIFORNIA FACES.

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.097
SPECIFIC INSIGNIFICANT AND VERY

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:08.600
UNIQUE CHALLENGES ARE BOTH

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:10.468
SHOOTING TO BE PREPARED AND TO

02:20:10.535 --> 02:20:13.238
MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS AS WELL AS

02:20:13.304 --> 02:20:15.006
TO ENSURE THAT. THEY ARE

02:20:15.073 --> 02:20:16.808
RECOVERING AND HAVE ACCESS TO

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:18.309
THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT THEY

02:20:18.376 --> 02:20:20.211
NEED GIVEN THEIR LOCATION AND

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:22.480
THEIR JOB. THAT IS. IT CAN BE

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:23.948
KIND OF REMOTE TO AND REMOVED

02:20:24.015 --> 02:20:29.487
FROM. MANY OF THOSE RESOURCES

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:31.489
SO. I'M AT THAT REPORT AND I

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:32.490
RECKON. THE POWER OF THAT

02:20:32.557 --> 02:20:33.591
THINKING. I'M AND THE RECORD

02:20:33.658 --> 02:20:35.560
THAT THEY ARE SOME VERY CRITICAL

02:20:35.627 --> 02:20:36.761
ANDPOWERFUL RECOMMENDATIONS

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.029
THAT HAPPENED THE INDISPENSABLE

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:39.998
TO LOOKING DEEPER AT AROUND. I

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.866
CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:43.101
THE COMMISSION WOULD I'M NOT

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:45.136
ONLY NEVER DO AGAIN BACK

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:47.038
CONTINUE TO DO BETTER NOW IN

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:48.873
THIS LARGER CALLAWAY ASKING.

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:52.777
WELL. IF- JUST TO COMMENT AND-

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.713
SO THE CONVERSE CATEGORY- I HAD

02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:57.916
THE MISFORTUNE. TO BE HONEST

02:20:57.982 --> 02:21:01.286
CITY COUNCIL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:03.454
NINE OF THE CITY THAT 60% OF THE

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:04.856
SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THE CORE

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:06.658
DOWNTOWN WAS DESTROYED BY AN

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:08.626
EARTHQUAKE WE HAD REMOVED THE-

02:21:08.693 --> 02:21:10.962
THE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN WAS CLOSE

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:13.298
FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS THERE

02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:16.701
WERE A WHOLE HOST. OF ISSUES AND

02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:19.237
WE HAD SOMEBODY COME TO US TWO

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.438
YEARS OUT FROM THAT EARTHQUAKE

02:21:20.505 --> 02:21:22.640
CAN SAY. ARE YOU HAVE BUILDINGS

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:23.675
IN THE DOWNTOWN THAT ARE

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:25.443
STRUCTURALLY SOUND AGAINST AN

02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:27.478
EARTHQUAKE IN THE STATE DID A

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:29.681
REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE A

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:30.748
COMPLETE INSPECTION ON ALL THE

02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:32.083
BUILDINGS AND THEIR STRUCTURAL

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:34.285
INTEGRITY DOWNTOWN. IT TURNED

02:21:34.352 --> 02:21:36.588
OUT OF A SCHEDULED TO COME TO US

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:38.089
THE TUESDAY AFTER THE

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.891
EARTHQUAKE. AND NOT STUDY

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:42.193
ACCURATELY PREDICTED. THE PLACES

02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:44.229
THAT PEOPLE DIED THE PLACES

02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:46.130
PEOPLE TRAPPED AND THE BUILDINGS

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:48.066
THAT WERE DESTROYED. AND IT

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:50.602
SPEAKS TO THE LARGER ROLE THAT

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:52.503
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE I

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.973
THINK. IN THE COMMISSION. IT IS

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:58.409
ALWAYS NOT A MATTER OF- IF

02:21:58.476 --> 02:21:59.978
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:02.347
BUT WHEN. AND THERE'S A MATTER

02:22:02.413 --> 02:22:04.716
OF HOW WE WILL BE PREPARED AND I

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:06.784
THINK WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME. IS

02:22:06.851 --> 02:22:08.853
THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.322
THE ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS QUAKES

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:13.625
LEARN FROM THEM. AND INCORPORATE

02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:16.828
THAT IN POLICY AND I WAS JUST

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:17.896
THINKING WHEN I WORKED HERE. MY

02:22:17.962 --> 02:22:19.697
GRANDMOTHER EVEN LIVED IN SANTA

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:20.798
ROSA FOR THAT EARTHQUAKE THAT

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:22.500
HAPPENED WHENEVER IT WAS FIFTY

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.335
YEARS AGO IT WAS TRAPPED IN A

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:26.204
BEDROOM UNTIL SOMEBODY CAME IN.

02:22:26.271 --> 02:22:28.539
AND GODART AND SO THIS IS

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:30.275
SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:33.945
EVERYWHERE SO WILL YOU. HE JUST

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.914
TO CLOSE THIS YEAR YOU REALLY

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:36.260
AND TWO AND TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:37.495
SOME OF THOSE SKILLS THAT MAY

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:38.896
NOT YET BE AND ARE LARGER

02:30:38.963 --> 02:30:40.698
POPULATIONS TO BE ABLE TO GO

02:30:40.765 --> 02:30:41.932
CHECK OUT WHAT IS YOUR BRACING

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:44.068
ON YOUR FOUNDATION LOOKS LIKE.

02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:45.669
AND- AND ALSO TO DIRECT OUR

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:46.837
HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL

02:30:46.904 --> 02:30:50.307
PROPERTY OWNERS- TO. TWO PEOPLE

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:53.077
WHO CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:53.711
SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR THEM

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:55.913
WERE TRAINED TO OUR LICENSE TO-

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:59.350
HAVE ACCESS TO. AND TO THE RIGHT

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:01.385
SKILLSET AND TO THE RIGHT- SET

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:04.155
OF TOOLS IN ORDER TO TRULY MAKE

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:06.457
THESE PROPERTIES- SAFE AND

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:08.692
READY. AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:10.528
FIRST THING AND THE SECOND THAT

02:31:10.594 --> 02:31:12.163
WE RECOGNIZE AS THE NEED FOR

02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:14.565
FUNDING TO FACILITATE AND TO

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:17.134
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MOVE IN THIS

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:19.403
DIRECTION- I WOULD SAY THE OTHER

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.037
THING IN THIS IS REFLECTING A

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:21.505
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SENATOR

02:31:21.572 --> 02:31:22.740
LAYERED ASKED. ABOUT LOOKING

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:25.843
BACKWARDS AT EARLIER EVENTS. AND

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.678
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:28.946
IN THEIR FRENCH. PRESSED A

02:31:29.013 --> 02:31:33.350
RECORD WAS THAT DOES. REQUESTS

02:31:33.417 --> 02:31:34.919
FOR SEISMIC SAFETY OR STRUCTURAL

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:37.354
SOUNDNESS TRACKS WERE VOLUNTARY

02:31:37.421 --> 02:31:38.189
AND NOT MANDATORY IN CERTAIN

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:40.758
AREAS. AND I THINK THOSE ARE

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:41.959
CALLED INTO QUESTION AND

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:43.861
DEFINITELY EQUITY QUESTIONS FOR

02:31:43.928 --> 02:31:46.730
ME AND SO- WHILE IT MAY NOT BE

02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:48.065
NECESSARY THE MOST POPULAR THING

02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:49.333
I DO THINK IN CERTAIN AREAS

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:51.302
THERE IS A MANDATORY EQUIREMENT

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:52.636
THAT YOU GO GET CHECKED OUT FOR.

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:55.172
AFTER STRUCTURAL SOUNDNESS AND

02:31:55.239 --> 02:31:57.374
I'D LOVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:57.975
EXPAND THAT MANDATORY. OF THE

02:31:58.042 --> 02:31:59.577
INSPECTION AND WEBER SAID A

02:31:59.643 --> 02:32:01.745
RECOGNITION THAT IF YOU MEET

02:32:01.812 --> 02:32:02.680
THOSE THOSE MANDATORY

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:03.714
REQUIREMENTS IF YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:05.115
COMING AND EVEN IF YOU'RE

02:32:05.182 --> 02:32:07.251
VOLUNTEERING STYLE. THERE IS

02:32:07.318 --> 02:32:08.986
ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT WILL OPEN

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:10.754
UP TO FACILITATE AND ENCOURAGE

02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:11.889
YOU TO MOVE TOWARDS RECORD

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:16.160
RESILIENCE. AND I THINK THAT THE

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:16.760
COMMISSION IS VERY CLEAR THAT.

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:19.964
AT THOSE FUNDS DO NOT IT GEN AND

02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:22.600
INSUFFICIENT. WAYS FOR FOLKS TO

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:24.502
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. ANOTHER

02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:27.071
ADDITIONAL. THREATS AND RISKS

02:32:27.137 --> 02:32:30.341
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OWN OF THEIR

02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:38.949
OWN. THESE. THAT WOULD. AND

02:32:39.016 --> 02:32:41.285
PRESIDENT CELANESE AT RECOGNIZE

WHAT APPEARS TO BE A VERY ROBUST

02:33:35.205 --> 02:33:36.941
- ROLE THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THAT

02:33:37.007 --> 02:33:39.043
WAY AND ON IF NOT VOLUNTEER WORK

02:33:39.109 --> 02:33:40.778
WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER NON

PROFITS AND THE PUBLIC AGENCIES

02:33:42.846 --> 02:33:44.181
OVER YOUR CAREER AND WE

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:45.916
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I DO

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:48.319
HAVE A QUESTION. REGARDING

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:49.753

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.655
STAFF AND LET ME BOB GIVE A

02:33:51.722 --> 02:33:53.557
PREAMBLE TO THAT I AM VERY

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:55.259
STRONG ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:57.061
AND LOCAL CONTROL AND YOU

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.463
ACTUALLY SAID ARE YOU SUGGESTED

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:00.898
THE COMMISSION COULD PUT OUT A

02:34:00.965 --> 02:34:03.000
BROCHURE TO RENTERS EXPLAINING

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:04.335
HOW TO DETERMINE IF THE HOUSE

02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:06.170
THE RENT IS UP TO CODE AND WHAT

02:34:06.236 --> 02:34:07.871
THE RAMIFICATIONS WOULD BE IF

02:34:07.938 --> 02:34:10.507
THEY ASK THE COUNTY TO DO AN

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:11.609
INSPECTION. AND I'M I'M KIND OF

02:34:11.675 --> 02:34:13.477
WONDERING WHY WE WOULD WANT THE

02:34:13.544 --> 02:34:14.712
FIVE MAKE COMMISSION SHOULD BE

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:16.547
REACHING BEYOND LOCAL

02:34:16.614 --> 02:34:18.415
GOVERNMENTS AND OUR CODE

02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:20.951
ENFORCEMENT AND GOING DIRECTLY

02:34:21.018 --> 02:34:23.053
TO RANCHERS WITH SOMETHING I

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.022
THINK COULD BE VERY CONFUSING TO

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:28.092
THEM AND ALMOST WITH. THAT THERE

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.660
COULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:33.597
AGAIN FOR LITIGATION THAT MIGHT

02:34:33.664 --> 02:34:37.968
HAVE NOT BEEN YOUR PURPOSE BUT.

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:38.902
BACK TO BEING A- OFFICIAL IT

02:34:38.969 --> 02:34:40.604
WILL. OUR CITY AND THE KING

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:42.873
LEVEL. THAT COULD CREE REAL. OUT

02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:45.275
THERE ARE YOU KNOW NOT BECAUSE-

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.944
SUGGESTING THAT. ARE WHAT THEY

02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:50.114
ARE RENTING IS WHO POTENTIALLY

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:52.216
MIGHT NOT UP TO CODE AND START

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.018
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY

02:34:54.084 --> 02:34:55.252
DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:34:55.319 --> 02:34:58.455
TO CONTROL. AND ADVICE AND THEN

02:34:58.522 --> 02:35:01.225
DRAFT CODE ENFORCEMENT OUR TO DO

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:02.993
WHAT COULD BE A MASSIVE-

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:05.129
INVESTIGATION MANY PROPERTIES SO

02:35:05.195 --> 02:35:06.030
I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:07.698
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT AND I DON'T

02:35:07.765 --> 02:35:09.566
WANT TO BE READING IT

02:35:09.633 --> 02:35:11.902
INCORRECTLY BECAUSE THAT WASN'T

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:12.970
IN THE MEETING. YES COULD HAVE

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.538
BEEN IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT BEDS

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:15.806
ARE I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR

02:35:15.873 --> 02:35:18.976
EXPLANATION ON THAT. THANK YOU

02:35:19.043 --> 02:35:20.811
FOR THAT QUESTION CENTER BATES-

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.346
ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY

02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:23.881
APPRECIATED ABOUT THE KIND OF

02:35:23.947 --> 02:35:26.850
REMAKING OF THE INSIDE OF THE

02:35:26.917 --> 02:35:28.285
COMMISSION AS THE RECOGNITION.

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:29.820
SPECIFIC INTERESTS THAT COME

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:31.588
FROM FOLKS WHO ARE SERVING IN

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.323
DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND WE HAVE

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:34.958
ROBUST REPRESENTATIVES FROM

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:35.626
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE

02:35:35.693 --> 02:35:38.228
COMMISSION- AND I WOULD ALSO SAY

02:35:38.295 --> 02:35:39.997
THAT I ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE

02:35:40.064 --> 02:35:41.298
QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE COMMISSION

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:43.500
AND IT'S- RECOGNITION THAT

02:35:43.567 --> 02:35:44.668
STAKEHOLDERS ARE MUCH BROADER

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:46.203
THAN. FIFTEEN OF US

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:48.505
COMMISSIONERS AND THAT- WE ARE

02:35:48.572 --> 02:35:50.207
EACH TASKED WITH THE IMPORTANT

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:51.975
RESPONSIBILITIES OF BRINGING

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.944
THINGS HERE ARE YOU ARE

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:55.846
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES AND- AND

02:35:55.913 --> 02:35:58.482
AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OFFICIAL

02:35:58.549 --> 02:36:01.151
I SEE THAT AS BEING HYPOCRITICAL

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:02.786
TO MY ROLE I'M IN THE STATE LIKE

02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:07.324
HI CITY AND SO. I DON'T SEE ANY

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:09.193
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- MAKING

02:36:09.259 --> 02:36:10.494
AVAILABLE A PAMPHLET THAT'S

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:13.030
DIRECTED TO OUR COMMERCIAL AND

02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:15.199
RESIDENTIAL. PROPERTY OWNERS ARE

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:17.401
HOMEOWNERS AROUND HOW THEY COULD

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:19.703
KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE- AND A

02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:21.505
PAMPHLET THAT WOULD ALSO GO TO

02:36:21.572 --> 02:36:24.141
RENTERS OF THOSE OF THOSE SAME

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:25.509
PROPERTIES AND- THAT WOULD

02:36:25.576 --> 02:36:27.444
CHALLENGE LOCAL CONTROL IN

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:30.647
PARTICULAR- I THINK AS YOU KNOW.

02:36:30.714 --> 02:36:32.249
WE RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF OUR

02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:33.951
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND BEING

02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:36.186
ABLE TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FROM

02:36:36.253 --> 02:36:37.121
ONE PERSPECTIVE WHAT THEY ARE

02:36:37.187 --> 02:36:39.256
SEEING. WHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:40.791
ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE THEIR

02:36:40.858 --> 02:36:42.392
EXISTING RIGHTS ARE BRINGING TO

02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:44.328
THEM IT IS A REALLY CRITICAL

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:49.199
FUNCTION. OF THEIR CAPACITY. AND

02:36:49.266 --> 02:36:51.368
SO I- I THINK THAT I'M I'M-

02:36:51.435 --> 02:36:54.104
ADJUSTING AT ALL THAT- M. THAT

02:36:54.171 --> 02:36:56.840
WOULD BE DIRECT TO RENTERS PLAN

02:36:56.907 --> 02:36:58.408
- WHAT THREATENS LOCAL CONTROL

02:36:58.475 --> 02:37:00.544
AND ANYWAY IN FACT IT WOULD JUST

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.112
BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

02:37:02.179 --> 02:37:05.682
MORE AND MORE UNDERSTANDING AND

02:37:05.749 --> 02:37:07.684
COMFORT WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:10.154
WE BECOME MORE RESILIENT AS YOU

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:11.855
KNOW IN IN EACH OF OUR ROLES IN

02:37:11.922 --> 02:37:12.990
OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER YOU ARE

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:14.758
A PROPERTY OWNER OR WHETHER YOU

02:37:14.825 --> 02:37:17.261
ARE VENTURA WHO CAN HELP YOUR-

02:37:17.327 --> 02:37:20.764
AND- YOUR- YOUR LANDLORD OR YOUR

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:22.466
COMMERCIALS AND MORE AND TO FIND

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:24.835
THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO KEEP.

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:27.171
THEIR PROPERTY SAFE AND AS A

02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:29.473
RESULT TO KEEP YOUR LIFE SAFE- I

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:30.674
THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:32.643
WOULD SAY IS THAT WORKING AS AN

02:37:32.709 --> 02:37:35.512
AS AN EQUITY ADVOCATE- WE REALLY

02:37:35.579 --> 02:37:37.080
COME AT THINGS WITH AN ASSET

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:39.917
FRAME NOT A DEFICIT AND WHEN YOU

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.919
HAVE A GREATER AMOUNT OF

02:37:41.985 --> 02:37:43.554
INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:45.455
GREATER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND

02:37:45.522 --> 02:37:47.024
WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACTIVATE

02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:48.926
PEOPLE'S SKILL SETS AND THERE

02:37:48.992 --> 02:37:51.094
ARE CONNECTIVITY TO GOVERNMENT

02:37:51.161 --> 02:37:53.964
INSTITUTIONS. AND THEIR OWN

02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:55.365
RECOGNITION OF THEIR

02:37:55.432 --> 02:37:57.100
RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR STATE'S

02:37:57.167 --> 02:38:01.972
LARGER. EFFORT AND SO. JUST JUST

02:38:02.039 --> 02:38:02.973
THREE. I AM SUGGEST THAT WE

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:04.808
REMOVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:06.710
IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.

02:38:06.777 --> 02:38:09.112
JUST THAT ANY MORE INFORMATION I

02:38:09.179 --> 02:38:10.647
THINK IN THE HANDS OF MORE

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:12.182
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS

02:38:12.249 --> 02:38:14.318
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF. PUBLIC

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:16.286
SAFETY AND STRUCTURAL SAFETY IN

02:38:16.353 --> 02:38:19.489
OUR COMMUNITIES I'M IS A GOOD

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:21.058
THING. THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:38:21.124 --> 02:38:23.093
RESPONSE I GUESS WE WILL

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:24.161
CONTINUE TO NOT TOTALLY AGREE ON

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:25.529
THAT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS TO ME

02:38:25.596 --> 02:38:27.431
LIKE. THE SIZE MAKE COMMISSION

02:38:27.497 --> 02:38:29.600
WOULD ACTUALLY SUPERSEDE THE

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:31.301
ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:38:31.368 --> 02:38:33.070
THEIR ENFORCEMENT ON PROPERTIES

02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:34.872
THAT ARE NOT UP TO. SNUFF

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:36.840
ACCORDING TO WHATEVER. THE

02:38:36.907 --> 02:38:38.742
REQUIREMENTS ARE IN A LOCAL

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:40.777
GOVERNMENTS THOSE DIFFERENT OF

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.212
FOR LET'S SAY COASTAL PROPERTIES

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:44.348
WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF MY

02:38:44.414 --> 02:38:44.982
DISTRICT. AND THOSE THAT MIGHT

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:47.050
BE MORE IN LAND IN TERMS OF THE

02:38:47.117 --> 02:38:48.919
RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE

02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:49.486
NOMINEES ARE FOLLOWING

02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:51.021
EARTHQUAKES AND WE HAVE A VERY

02:38:51.088 --> 02:38:52.856
ROBUST WARNING SYSTEM ALONG THE

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:54.691
COASTAL PROPERTIES ALREADY. SO I

02:38:54.758 --> 02:38:56.426
JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING- THAT

02:38:56.493 --> 02:38:58.262
SUBORDINATES LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:38:58.328 --> 02:39:00.063
A SEISMIC COMMISSION IN IN

02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:01.665
PARTICULAR YOUR APPOINTMENT TO

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:03.066
THAT WHICH IS AND SOCIAL

02:39:03.133 --> 02:39:04.868
SERVICES NOT CODE ENFORCEMENT.

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:07.204
INSTABILITY OF THE BUILDINGS AND

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:09.573
WEBER WITH THE CODE FOR A AND

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:11.074
VARIOUS REGIONS IS A LITTLE

02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:14.645
OVERREACH- BY THE WAY I LOOK AT

02:39:14.711 --> 02:39:17.514
IT LAST QUESTION. ABOUT WHAT YOU

02:39:17.581 --> 02:39:17.981
SEE IS FOR TRADITIONAL

02:39:18.048 --> 02:39:18.715
RESPONSIBILITY OF FOR THE

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:20.417
APPOINTMENT TO THE SOCIAL

02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:22.886
SERVICE FEET. ON THE SEISMIC

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:23.787
COMMISSION AND I ASK YOU THAT

02:39:23.854 --> 02:39:26.356
BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:27.057
AN EMPLOYEE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:39:27.124 --> 02:39:28.959
SOCIAL SERVICES. AND HAPPENED TO

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:30.861
BE THERE DURING A COUPLE AT

02:39:30.928 --> 02:39:32.930
LEAST ONE OF THE EARTHQUAKES WE

02:39:32.996 --> 02:39:34.731
HAVE A CASELOAD THAT DEFINE

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:36.867
WHERE THOSE ARE VERY LOW INCOME

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:38.201
AND VERY VULNERABLE PROPERTIES

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:40.604
OLD ONES BY THE WAY. SO IT WOULD

02:39:40.671 --> 02:39:43.106
BE VERY EASY THROUGH THE SOCIAL

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:43.874
SERVICES AGENCY IF YOU ARE THE

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:45.709
REPRESENTATIVE. IN THE ADOPTION

02:39:45.776 --> 02:39:47.844
OF WE NEED EDUCATION TO USE THAT

02:39:47.911 --> 02:39:50.213
AS A VEHICLE BY TWO TO BE

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.182
RELATING TO THROUGH THE COUNTIES

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:54.318
TO THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:56.787
DEPARTMENTS. OF HOW TO PROVIDE

02:39:56.853 --> 02:39:58.755
EDUCATION TO THOSE FOLKS THAT

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:06.163
ACTUALLY ARE. OUR IN. OUR SOCIAL

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:06.763
SERVICES CASELOADS. THANK YOU

02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:08.966
SENATOR SO- YOUR LAST EVER. THE

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:10.100
IT SHOULD HIS. OF THIS POSITION

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.768
APPOINTMENT- IT'S MY

02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:13.403
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS FIRST

02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:14.571
POSSESSION OF THE SOCIAL

02:40:14.638 --> 02:40:15.772
SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE ON THE

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:16.907
COMMISSION IS ACTUALLY A NEW

02:40:16.974 --> 02:40:18.909
POSITION AS A RESULT OF THE

02:40:18.976 --> 02:40:20.077
RESTRUCTURING THE COMMISSION.

02:40:20.143 --> 02:40:21.278
AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:40:21.345 --> 02:40:23.013
THERE IS. A TRADITIONAL

02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.282
HISTORICAL ROLE IN THIS CAPACITY

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:27.718
I WOULD SAY THAT. AGAIN GIVEN MY

02:40:27.784 --> 02:40:30.620
EXPERIENCE. IN LOOKING AT OUR

02:40:30.687 --> 02:40:32.522

02:40:32.589 --> 02:40:34.024
IMMEDIATE DISASTER RESPONSE AND

02:40:34.091 --> 02:40:36.226
RECOVERY. AND OTHER DISASTERS

02:40:36.293 --> 02:40:38.095
HAS PREPARED ME VERY WELL FOR

02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:39.429
BEING ABLE TO LUCK WITH A

02:40:39.496 --> 02:40:40.931
CRITICAL EYE TOWARDS. OUR

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:42.833
CURRENT BENEFITS STRUCTURE IS IN

02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:45.736
PLACE. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE

APPARENT NURSES WAS AFFABLE

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:49.639
RECOVERY AS I MENTIONED IN MY IN

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:52.442
MY COMMENTS EARLIER. AND WE ARE

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:54.077
SEEING NATIONAL DATA THAT SHOWS

02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.146
US THAT THERE GREATER NUMBER OF

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:57.180
FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT FLOWS INTO

02:40:57.247 --> 02:40:58.815
A CAMINO. COMMUNITY AFTER A

02:40:58.882 --> 02:41:01.618
DISASTER ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.920
IMPACTS INEQUITIES- IT DEPENDS

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:05.589
AND EXACERBATES THEM AND SO I

02:41:05.655 --> 02:41:08.658
THINK AND MY ROLE AS- THE SOCIAL

02:41:08.725 --> 02:41:13.330

SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES ACTUALLY

02:41:19.403 --> 02:41:21.405
SERVE TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE. WHO

02:41:21.471 --> 02:41:22.906
MOST NEED TO BE SERVED AND HOW

02:41:22.973 --> 02:41:24.808
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THE
