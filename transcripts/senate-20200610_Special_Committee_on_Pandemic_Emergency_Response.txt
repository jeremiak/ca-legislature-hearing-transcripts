THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUE THIS IS A NATIONAL ISSUE. ALL FIFTY STATES IN THE UNITED STATES USE THE CMS QUALITY AND SAFETY OVERSIGHT MODEL. WHICH IS A ONCE A YEAR AND WILL VISIT TO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER- INVESTIGATIONS OR FACILITY INCIDENTS THAT MIGHT BE RECORDED. IT'S A VERY REACTIVE PROCESS. YOU GO IN ON SCHEDULE TIMES AND ANNOUNCED AND YOU GO IN AFTER SOMETHING HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IS YOU PA IS CRAIG SISTER GOING OUT OF THIS PENDANT IT TAKES SOME OF THE PAIN TRAUMA THAT WE WITNESSED. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SYSTEMS THAT WILL LONG AT LAST AFTER POST PANDEMIC THAT WILL IMPROVE OUR QUALITY AND SAFETY OVERSIGHT NOT JUST DURING. BUT FOR YEARS TO COME. SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS ALL WALK YOU THROUGH. BUT I DO WANT TO ECHO THAT. BEFORE WASHINGTON HAD THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OUTBREAK WE WERE ALREADY WATCHING ITALY WE WERE ALREADY WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AROUND THE WORLD PARTICULARLY TO THEIR SKILLED NURSING. YOU THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ISSUE WHICH IS WHY WE ACTIVATED THE MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER ON JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH. WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SINCE THAT DAY. ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH WE STARTED HAVING ALL FACILITY CALLS AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS NOT JUST TAKE HOSPITALS BUT PARTICULARLY TO OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL ADDITIONAL WEEKLY CALLS THAT FOCUS ON CHEST INFECTION PREVENTION. FOR OUR NURSING HOMES. WE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES WE LOOKED INTERNALLY AND WE FOUND THAT ALL OF US HAD NOT ONLY A NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF PP BUT THERE WAS A GLOBAL SHORTAGE YOU PP EARLIER AND I'M. SO BEST HAD ISSUE WITH TRYING TO FIGURE WAYS TO HAVE. BETTER PP SYSTEM. ALL OF US STAFF SHORTAGE ACROSS ALL OF STATE. AND ALL OF THE WERE TRY TO WHICH INFO PER. AS WE NOTE THAT THIS IS AN IN. THAT PRETTY. JUST HAVE THE- OR STABLE WORK FORCE. TO BE ABLE TO SURE THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH DONNIE AND DOFFING. COMFORTABLE WITH SPEAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT. CONTAMINATING ON AND SO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDED IN THE HOUSE EDUCATION. SO THERE WE TRIPLED THE A- OF OUR HEALTH OF WHY. STRIKE TEAMS. ON WITHIN ONE MONTH. BOB WE ALL THEN READER ALL ONE OF OUR- HEALTH THIS EVALUATE NURSES FROM THERE RIGHT. SURVEY SCHEDULE INTO GOING INTO ACTIVELY INTO THESE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE. PREVENTION TRAINING WE DID WEBINARS AS WELL AS ON SITE IN PERSON TRAINING. ON HOW TO DO ALL OF THESE INFECTIONS. CALL. BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH I WE RECKON. THAT THE PIN WHEN IN THE CASES ARISE AND DOES. PRICING NO HOW MUCH EDUCATE WE GAVE NO MATTER HOW MUCH P. D. EITHER WE TRY TO CREATE. FOR WE'RE STAFFING. WE CREATED THE HEALTH HEALTH COOL WE HAD COUNTRY STAY THAT WE HAD A BILL. WE TRIED TO DO. IT BUT IT WAS STILL WASN'T BECAUSE WE STILL A VERY REACTIVE. SO IN APRIL WE DECIDE TO CREATE A- URGENT NEEDS TO FOR. WE WERE THAT EVERY SKILLED TO. MUST FOR THEIR- BY NOON. AND AS THE RIVER THERE FROM. AND OUR SURVEYOR SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR WATCHED A DASH. WHERE WITH THEIR LIFE. THE STILL WHEN THE AND THEIR FROM. IT'LL EITHER UP IS A GREEN LIGHT AS OR AS A- IN A BILL IN. YOU SEE WHAT IT MEANS THEY HAVE. BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH SO THEY WE DECIDED TO CREATE SOME PROJECT AMANDA. SO THEN WE FIVE ON A ALL THE CA DATA FROM. I WELL AS TAKING THE IT IN FOR WE'RE GETTING A DALY AND THEN TRYING TO PREDICT WHO WOULD BE ARE HIGH RISK. AND THEN CALL THEM AND BE CON THEM AND BY FOR ON SITE VISIT. I'M SINCE THE- WE HAVE NOW WE'RE SO A MASK. FOR THE FIRST MONTHS THE SNAP. FROM MARCH TO JUNE. AND WE FOR THAT HELD EVE THOUGH WE TWELVE AND FOUR. WHICH IS AND THE AMOUNT WITH. AND VETS. AND ANY OTHER STATE. WE ARE TWENTY THIRD. WHEN IT COMES TO. THE DEATH RATE FOR WHAT THE- AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I AVERAGE JUST READ IS SO LOW. IT TO HELP PEOPLE WE HAVE TO PROTECT SERVE SO MANY REMOTE. GEOGRAPHIC DOG. WE THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS OF GO. ON SITE AND HAVING PHYSICAL. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ON SITE AND HAD MORE PHYSICAL. THAT ANY OTHER STATE IN FACT. CALLED ME I. THEY WERE TO KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHERS AND HOW THEY CAN. IT IN OTHER AS A MODEL. BUT AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LONG TERM.

SEVERAL THINGS ARE NO WE'RE ABOUT STATE YOU FIRST OVER A- OF THE STATE'S HELL CARE. ARE LOW IN OUR TOWN. SECOND WERE THE ONLY COUNTY THE STATE AND NAY AT PERFORMS. ANSWERED ON OF STATE SINCE THE NINETEEN SO ALL COUNTY HAS FOR. THE FUNDED. YOUR CON WITH THE OF HEALTH THE STATE TO PERFORM THIS WORK. JULY OF LAST YEAR WOULD BE A NEW THREE YEAR. WHICH FULL SOME. OF THE WORK LOW GENERATE BY HELL CARE FOR. WITHIN THE COUNTY YOU ARE ALL. SINCE DIVISION. AND THIRD ARE TO. IS UNIQUE IN A HEALTH AL REACH WHICH WRECK WORK WITH HEALTHCARE. REDRESS ISSUES OF ACTION AND PREVENTION SO WE ARE UNIQUELY. TO RISK UNDER CHALLENGES BETTER. KOBE NINE EARLIER YEAR. AMONG THE THREE HUNDRED FOR. FREE STAY BUILDING CAMPUS. IN INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING SNAPS AMONG THE COUNTY'S TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DEATHS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR OR 51% EVER HEARD AMONG RESIDENTS IN SNAPS. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION IN APRIL AND RECOMMENDED UNIVERSAL MASKING AT THAT TIME. THE SAME TIME WE ADOPTED A MASS TESTING STRATEGY A TEST KITS AVAILABLE ALL THIS. PLAYER OWN STRIKING TO SPECIMENS. RESIDENTS AND STAFF BASED ON THOSE RESULTS WE ASSIST FACILITIES AND CO BOARDING RESIDENTS BASED ON WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN INFECTED OR THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED AS A MEANS TO LIMIT FURTHER SPREAD. TODAY TO DATE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN STEPS ARE COMPLETED BASELINE FOR OUTBREAK RELATED TESTING AND THE REMAINDER WILL BE DONE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. WE WORK WITH OUR COUNTY CMS AGENCY TO MONITOR PP SUPPLY AND OF HEALTH AND DISTRIBUTING PP AS SOON AS IT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. WE HELP SHORTAGES INCLUDING REQUESTING ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE FEDERAL LEVELS NATIONAL GUARD NBA TEAMS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED MORE THAN A DOZEN STOPS. WORKING WITH THE CDC WE POST MULTIPLE TRAINING SESSIONS BUILD CAPACITY MANAGING PREVENT OUTBREAKS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'VE OBSERVED A RECENT MARKED DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS OCCURRING AMONG RESIDENTS THESE FACILITIES. IT REALLY SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF SHORTAGE IS A PT HAVE BEEN MAJOR ISSUE BOTH FOR **** STAFF AS WELL AS FOR OWN STAFF. WE'VE DEPLOYED. THIS WOULD. YES HE WAS FAIRLY MINUTE UNTIL THE CAL AND LA CITY TO OUR OWN SUPPLY FOR TO. REAL LOCAL LAB. SOME SNIFFED STAFF TO TEST BUT M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> DON'T. WE RESPOND BY MAKE OUR OWN STAFF OR- STAFF AVAIL TO MEET NEED. THIS IS BEEN VERY REESE CENTER. TESTING HAS FACED MALL IS CHALLENGES AS I'M SURE YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT. ANOTHER ISSUE IS FEAR AMONG BOTH SNIFF AND DEPARTMENT STAFF AND THIS IS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS IN THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DRESS WORKER CONCERNS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. TRANSFERS OF PATIENTS BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND SNATCHES BEEN A MAJOR CHALLENGE WE'VE WORKED HARD BOTH WITH HOSPITALS AND FACILITY. TO DEVELOP APPROACHES TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY TRANSFERS AND ALLOW EARLY REPATRIATIONS GO DEVELOPING OPEN UNIX. RECEIVE OPEN INFECTED ASIANS A FEW THOUGHTS FOR MOVING FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE LA COUNTY REALLY. IT'S THE ONGOING OR- BE AND CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TECH RESIDENTS OF **** AND OTHER POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY PAUL PAUL. OUT COMES IN NINETEEN ANY EFFORT YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME. FOLLOWING WOULD BE GREATLY. FIRST IN HEY THE CUP OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT JUST OR INFECTION CAN. ISSUES AND WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION INCLUDING SNAPS SECOND SUPPORT INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO BETTER TRACK HEALTH OUTCOMES AND RELATED HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS TESTING. RELATION TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND SNAPS THIRD SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING AND SERVICES TO RESPOND OUTBREAKS INCLUDING INCREASED CASTINGA BOTH RESIDENTS AND STAFF. AND FOURTH GRADE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT ENHANCE THE PROTECTION OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS THIS CAN TRAIN NEW SERVICES CRITICAL RESPONDTO EMERGING INFECTIONS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR GUNS AND HOUSE ARE WE APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL AND NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR- THIRD PRESENTER. WHO IS DOCTOR SERRA CODY SENATE CLEARS COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTIES HEALTH OFFICER AFTER. IS ACTUALLY ONLY AVAILABLE INTO TEN AM THIS MORNING SO MAKE SURE SHE- GETS ON ACCESS AND Q. WILL. THANK YOU AB MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARE SERRA. AND AGAIN I'M HELP ON FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A- BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR COUNTY OF OUR APPROACH. TO PREVENTING- ILLNESS AND DEATH AMONG ARSONIST RESIDENTS- AND THEN SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OF DATA FRO OUR COUNTY. SO WOULD YOU KNOW- WE ARE A COUNTY OF ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION- IN THE BAY AREA THE LARGEST JURISDICTION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY- WE- EARLY ON AGAIN WATCHING THE EXPERIENCE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OTHER LONG TERM CARE FACILITY- AS- AS BEING REALLY ESSENTIALLY LIKE DRY TENDER- IT AS FAR AS- HOPE IT GOES AND WE WERE QUITE- QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR RESIDENTS THERE. I THINK OUR OVERALL APPROACH IS REALLY THREE FOLD- ONE TO PREVENT- INTRODUCTION OF- OF KOBE INTO LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND INTO A VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION. I TO EARLY DETECTION- SO THAT WE CAN PICK UP A PROBLEM EARLY AND THREE. OF COURSE IS CONTAINMENT- SO THAT WE CAN GET AN OUTBREAK UNDER CONTROL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER WE DETECT IT- OUR WORK ACTUALLY STARTED- IN IN EARLY MARCH WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THAT WE HAD- COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. DEPLOYED TO THE COUNTY THIS WAS BECAUSE WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTIES IN THE STATE- TO HAVE IDENTIFIED CODED CASES. SO WE HAD QUITE A BIT OF HELP EARLY ON- SO BACK IN EARLY MARCH WE HAD CONTACT. A HUNDRED AND THREE SKILLED NURSING. AND OTHER LONG TERM CARE FACILITY TO REVIEW EACH FACILITIES AND FACTION PREVENTION POLICY AND TO REINFORCE. REINFORCE THAT GUIDANCE- MOST OF THE WORK HAS BEEN- WE'VE REALLY HAD TO CREATE AN ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. IN ORDER TO. TO PREVENT DETECT AND CONTAIN OUTBREAKS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NORMALLY DESPITE THE SIZE OF OUR COUNTY WE HAVE ONE PERSON. WHO HELPS PREVENT AND CONTROL OUTBREAKS IN INSTABILITY WE NOW HAVE A WHOLE UNIT. SPECIAL INVETIGATIONS UNIT WITHIN OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER I THINK WE DEVOTED TO PREVENTING AND CONTROLLING- COBIT. IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. SO JUST TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT THAT UNIT- HAS HAS DONE I THINK THAT THE NUMBERS- REALLY TELL TELL A STORY EIGHT. WE HAD INCREASING ILLNESS AND DEATH IN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT PEAK IN MID APRIL AND AS OF NOW WE HAVE NO CURRENT OUTBREAKS WE HAVE VERY VERY FEW CASES- ALL TOLD AMONG OUR OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. AND STAFF AND RESIDENTS ANYONE ASSIST YOU BUT- DO YOU REPRESENT ABOUT SIXTEEN OF OUR CASES HOWEVER. GILDERSLEEVE FACILITY RESIDENTS REPRESENTS- ALMOST 48% OF THE DEATHS IN OUR COUNTY- WHICH IS OF COURSE I'M SIMILAR TO THE TOP. THAT IS CHEATING. THE STATE HARPER BEN TO BE EX HANDS ON SO IF ARE WE HAVE BEEN STAR AT AND THEN JUST IT TO ARE FOR HUGE IS IN OUR IS AS ELSEWHERE WE DISTRIBUTED MASS AMOUNTS TO TORQUE TO FILL. ARE FISCALLY AS A DOCTOR GUNS AND HOUSE ARE MEANT FOR LA ARE ALSO REALLY STRUGGLING WITH TESTING- AND SO WE HAVE RESOURCE TESTING WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHETHER IT STANDING UP A- A TESTING SITE OR HAVING OUR STAFF THE WIND. WE ALL CAN ACCOUNTED A LOT OF ISSUE. IN WE HAD TO. WITH LARGE OUTBREAKS THAT HAS SHORTAGES DUE TO FEAR DUE TO ILLNESS AND WE ARE. SO IN OUR COUNTY NURSE AND CONTRACTORS INTERNSHIPS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE CAUGHT ME IS CARE FOR RESIDENTS DURING DURING THAT REAL. COLD. SO IN SHORT I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS BEEN INCREDIBLY REACH CENTER AND THE JUST TO ECHO WHAT OTHERS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED OUR PRIMARY CHALLENGES HEAD BAND- PP SHORTAGES- STAFFING ISSUES PARTICULARLY- VERY HIGH STAFF TURNOVER SO ONCE SOMEONE IS TRAINED IN INFECTION CONTROL THE NEXT TIME WE ENTER THE FACILITY WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE NEW STAFF THERE BECAUSE THE VERY HIGH VERY HIGH TURNOVER AND PPP AT PP ISSUES ONE FINAL TO THE HIGH BEFORE I. AFTER PART OF THAT WE NOTED THAT WHEN WE HAVE HAD BREAKS IN OUR SKILLED FACILITY I'M MORE I THAN NOT THE END PAGE IS A STAFF PERSON WITH A MY SYMPTOM. OR EIGHT ABOUT AND WHO ALL KNOW BRINGING OF COLD AND TWO PIECES. HI THE CRITICAL AND- FREQUENT TEST. OF STOCK ANOTHER UNDER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT OF OUR OUT WORKER IS INSTABILITY COM UM THIS TRINITY THAT ARE COUNTY ARE JUST LOOK. AND BY. AND SO THE SKILLED FACILITY AND THEN WAYS ABOUT THREE THE NEXT IN THE WAY THAT AND IS IN OUR- AND CHEN. THANK YOU AND THE I HAVE A HARD IT TEN BUT I HOW TO STAY ON UNTIL THE THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH TO CODE WE- THAT IN. WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER FOURTH PRESENTER IS CRA THE C. E. O. PRESS OF THE- SISSY OF HEALTH FACILITIES WELCOME MISTER CORNET. THANK LISTEN AND MEMBERS OF THE CAN AIMS CRAIG CORNET I'M S. OF THE- SAYS OF HELP. YOUR TO REPRESENT THE TWELVE HUNDRED- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA- WHO SERVED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY DAY DISABLED AND ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS EVERY DAY- AND EMPLOY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A CALIFORNIANS AS OUR STAFF- IT'S UNUSUAL FOR ME TO TESTIFY. THESE SETTINGS BUT I WANTED TO THE REASON I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY IS TO TELL YOU THE IMPORTANCE. AT AND HOW. WE TAKE THESE ISSUES- I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE- THE PROBLEMS THAT THREE THINGS THE PROBLEMS WE FACE. WHERE THINGS STAND TODAY AND WHAT'S AHEAD. I WANT TO START OUT AT THE SAID BY BY TELLING YOU WE MOURN THE VICTIMS OF THIS PANDA. OF RESIDENCE. AND THE PATIENTS THAT ARE THE ONLY. UP WITH. PASS CODE WITH THAT IT STAFF MARCUS SO OKAY FROM CO. FOR THEIR FAMILIES THE MORE THE MALL THIS IS BEEN JUST. FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT IT'S BEEN DESTRUCTIVE THE ARE REST AND I AM AND THE FAN OF OUR RAY. AND FOR CARE GIVERS. OUT OUTLINED FOR YOU QUICKLY. THE PROBLEM FIVE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THUS FAR. FIRST OF ALL NUMBER ONE KOBE NINETEEN LIKE NOW WE'VE SEEN ENTER OF A OF HAND THEM IN IN THIS. FOR THAT IT IS FOR TWO. IT'S BEEN A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR SOCIETY WHICH ARE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTH COMPROMISED AND THAT IS A 100% OF THE PEOPLE WHO. ARE OUR RESIDENTS AND PATIENTS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. NUMBER TWO THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VIRUS HAS CHANGED AND CHANGED. WE'VE LEARNED FOR A- LATE IN THE PROCESS A SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE- WHETHER THEY BE RESIDENTS VISITORS ARE CARE GIVERS. COULD ACTUALLY THAT THEY COULD BE A SYMPTOMATIC BUT COULD BE STILL SPREADING THE VIRUS WITHOUT SHOWING ANY SIGNS. OF THAT THAT HAS BEEN A PART PROBLEM. WELL INTO THE- JUST CHARGE FROM THE HOSPITALRESIDENTS JUST FROM THE HOSPITAL STAFF COMING IN OUR VISITORS COMING- THEY WERE SPREADING THE VIRUS BEFORE WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS POSSIBLE- AND SHOWING NO SIGN NUMBER THREE. AND THAT'S WHEN I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH OF FROM THE GET GO THERE HAS BEEN INADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WE KNOW NOW THAT. PARTICULAR KINDS OF EQUIPMENT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO AVOID THE SPREAD OF CODE. UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT THE SUPPLY CHAINS WERE NOT AVAILABLE- FACILITIES DIDN'T HAVE IT THE COUNTIES DIDN'T HAVE IT AND NO ONE REALLY HAD IT AND THAT WAS A IT'S BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM- I NOTICED IN YOUR IN YOUR- COMMITTEE ROB WORK THAT WAS SOME NOTES. TAKE NOTATE ABOUT MAKES HOME PP BUT THE REASON THAT WAS IT WILL AVAIL ADEQUATE PP WASN'T AVAILABLE THAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO AVOID THE SPREAD. I OR I WOULD MENTION YOU AND ALSO IS VERY. THERE HAS BEEN ADDED IN ADEQUATE TESTING TESTING HAS RAMPED UP VERY NICELY MORE RECENTLY. THE TESTING WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS YOU NEED TESTING- IS O CRITICAL- AND AT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHO IS POSITIVE AND ESPECIALLY THEN AFTER. THAT WE CAN BE SPREADING THE DISEASE- BUT THAT WAS NOT REALLY RATTLED TESTING WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY. AND UP FIVE AND I'M I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC THE FOCUS AND THE EMPHASIS WAS REALLY ON OUR HOSPITALS. UNDERSTANDABLY SO THERE WAS A I THOUGHT THE AT THAT POINT THE MODELING WAS SHOWING WE MIGHT NEED FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL BEDS BEYOND WHAT WE HAD. AND THE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS WAS NOT ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IT CAME LATER. AB PRIORITY WAS PROVIDE INITIALLY FOR PP AND FOR AYE TESTING WAS IN THE HOSPITALS NOT AT NOT ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT HAS RESULTED DâN BY THE TIME THE FOCUS DID TURN TO SKILLED NURSING IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE THE DISEASE THAT ARE ENTERED THE FACILITIES. AND IT WAS SPREADING TO PLAY. IN ADDITION I WOULD SAY TO BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE- EMPHASIS THERE WERE CONFLICTS WAS CONFLICTING STANDARDS AND FLIPPING. THAT I THINK THAT HAVE EVERYWHERE APRS GUIDANCE FROM FROM THE FEDERAL. GUIDE FROM THE STAY GUIDES FROM THE COUNTIES AND DIFFERENT DIFFERENT GUIDANCE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. SO THAT I THINK REALLY REALLY HINDERED ARE SITUATION ALL THE WAY AROUND. LET ME TURN TO WHAT IS NEEDED NOW WHAT'S NEEDED NOW I THINK IT'S SUPPORT SUPPORT FROM FROM THE PUBLIC FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT I WOULD SAY OUR FORESEES. COORDINATION COLLABORATION COMMUNICATION AND CONSISTENCY BETWEEN- GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT BODIES- AND ASSISTANCE AGAIN FROM. FROM PROVIDERS AND WOOD AND THE- SOME READ REDUCTION OF THE LOCAL VARIATION WE SEE- AGAIN TESTING IS SO WEIRD WE ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD ON TESTING BY THE END OF THIS MONTH OFFICE. WILL HAVE DONE BASELINE TESTING. THE LADY SAID NOW RAMPED UP AND HAVE MITIATION OF PLANTS COMPLEX THAT CD PHP IS CURRENTLY YOU. ARE I ALSO WOULD TO WHAT IS REALLY- NEEDED NOW IS TO RECOGNIZE THE FACTS AND THE DATA- I THINK YOU HEARD DOCTOR CODY SAY THIS BUT THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH FROM ORIG WE HAVE. THIRTY MORE SAY SORRY TO INTERRUPT HAS TOLD US THAT INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS THAT A SENTIMENT SPREAD. STING WERE REALLY THE MAIN FOR THE OUT AND NOT SO MY- THAT LACK OF THE HISTORY THE BUILDING OF THE FALL. OF THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO DIALOGUE WITH THE LEAD TO ON THIS THE OTHER THINGS I WOULD JUST CLOSE IF WE WILL BELIEVE THAT IS WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS- THEREAFTER SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. PRESENTER I'M SORRY THAT BUT THINK YOU VERY MUCH- AND THEN OUR FINAL CENTER IS TONY CHICKEN TELL STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. WELCOME MISTER CHICKEN TELL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS TONY CHECK ITSELF- STAFF ATTORNEY WITH CALIFORNIA AND THE KIDS FOR NURSING HOME REFORM ALSO KNOWN AS SCANNER. I AM TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. RESIDENTS AROUND THE STATE ARE SCARED ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED. WE NEED TO LEARN FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING TO IMPROVE LONG TERM CARE IS NOT BLEEDING OR PUNISHING WHEN WE EXAMINE SYSTEMIC WEAK POINTS FAILURES IT'S FOR FILLING OUR PUBLIC COMMITMENTS TO ASSESS AND TO GROW. WHAT TO THE DEVASTATION IN NURSING HOMES HAS BEEN AVOIDABLE. WE HAVE HAD DECADES OF PEOPLE STATE LEADERSHIP AND HALF HEARTED ENFORCEMENT GBH. WE HAVE A PUBLIC PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT DIVIDES FACILITIES INTEREST FROM RESIDENTS INTEREST. WE'VE CREATED THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PANDEMICS WILL KILL NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WITH. THAT. WHEN COLBERT HIDDEN- SING RESIDENTS AND STAFF WERE SACRIFICED IN FAVOR OF OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. THERE WERE MANY FATAL MISSTEPS. ONE SURVEY YEARS OMBUDSMAN AND FAMILIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM FACILITIES CREATING A MASSIVE LOSS OF OVERSIGHT AND DIRECT HERE. SOME OF THE WORST DISABILITIES IN THE STATE OF BEING DESIGNATED AS COVERT NINETEEN FACILITY. SINCE MARCH CALIFORNIA HAS PERFORMED OVER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FACTION CONTROL SURVEYS IN DID NOT ISSUE A SINGLE INFECTION CONTROL DEFICIENCY. AS A RESULT. THE SURVEYORSWERE TOLD NOT TO ISSUE DEFICIENCIES AND GET CLEAN BILLS OF HEALTH STORIES AROUND THE PROCESS. RANGING ENORMOUS COOLEY NINETEEN OPERATE. NOWWE HAVE TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS DEAD OVER TWO THOUSAND. TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS IMPACTED IN ALMOST SIX THOUSAND STAFF MEMBERS. WE GET THEOUTCOME OUR SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THERE ARE NO SURPRISES HERE WELL BEFORE COLLUDED TO CDC ESTIMATES THAT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT HOURS IN LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS DIE ANNUALLY. FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN OUR COUNTRY. WE PUT OUR SICKEST MOST REAL PEOPLE INTEREST CROWDED BUILDINGS WITH INSUFFICIENT STAFFING RUN BY BUSINESS PEOPLE WHOSE ULTIMATE GOAL IS NOT TO PROVIDE GOOD CARE BUT TO TAKE PROFITS FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS. INCREDIBLY PROVIDING GOOD CARE IS NOT A LINE PROFITABILITY. THIS IS NOT JUST FACT IT IS THE PRODUCT OF DESIGN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NURSING REVENUE COMES FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN IMPULSE SHOPPER. USING ITS HEART AND NOT ITS HEAD WHEN SHOVELS OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR HIS VOICE STEVEN ENORMOUS NO STRINGS ATTACHED REYES THIS MONTH. KANTOR HAS SUBMITTED A TEN POINT PLAN FOR STATEWIDE LONG TERM CARE REFORM. YOUR SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION. RELATED TO UNFORTUNATE ACCOUNTABILITY ENFORCEMENT IS WEAK ONCE AGAIN STARS IN HOMES OF EXPLODED VIOLATIONS LIKE BAD INFECTION CONTROL ARE COMMONPLACE BUT ARE NOT DISCOURAGED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FINE. 99% OF INFECTION CONTROL VIOLATIONS ARE CALLED NO HARM. PROVIDERS OF STOCK BLANKET IMMUNITYFOR WRONGDOERS YOU CAN CONNECT GROSS NEGLIGENCE THE CAUSE OF DEATH. WHAT WE NEED WHAT WE ARE LONG NEEDED THIS TRUMP TOWER RESIDENTS AND VICTIMS OF POOR CARE TO DO THEIR OWN ENFORCEMENT. EVH IS PROVEN FOR DECADES AND THEY CAN'T GET THIS DROPPED OUT. STABBING OUR MINIMUM STAFFING STANDARDS ARE TO LOWER OFTEN VIOLATED. NEED TO RAISE THE STABBING MINIMUMS PARTICULARLY FOR REGISTERED NURSES. AND DUMP THE WAIVERS AGAIN FACILITIES A PAST PROVIDE LESS STANDING THE MINIMUM. THERE'S BUDGET LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW WITH THE SIMPLE REFORMS COULD BE AT. OWNERSHIP OUR WORST OPERATORS TAKEOVER NURSING HOMES WITHOUT LICENSES AND SLOT THERE AND PROFIT FOR YEARS. THROW OUT THESE OPERATORS YOU DON'T HAVE LICENSES.

AGAIN THAT'S PLEASE USE ACCESS CODE SIX THREE TWO. SIX EIGHT THREE ZERO AGAIN THAT IS ACCESS CODE SIX THREE TWO. SIX EIGHT THREE ZERO. THANK YOU AND I WILL ACTUALLY BEGIN WITH THE VERY FIRST QUESTION AND I THINK AGAIN OUR PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE- WE'RE CERTAINLY DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALTHOUGH- WE MAY BE A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES IF I FEEL THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE. AND BEING A MEMBER OF LA COUNTY- I KNOW AND IN THIS IS BOTH FOR LA COUNTY AND FOUR CD PH I KNOW THAT LA COUNTY HAS ITS OWN CERTIFICATION AND LICENSING PROCESS- BUT SIMILAR TO THE- ACTION TAKEN BY THE LA COUNTY SUPERVISORS WE HAD A BACKLOG OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND- SNF- INVESTIGATIONS. LAST YEAR'S I'D LIKE TO KIND OF WALK THROUGH HOW THOSE BACKLOGS. ARE LOOKING NOW AND WHAT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS FOR. ON THIS INSPECTOR GENERAL NOW BEING A PART OF THIS. THE PROP. FIGURES TO LIMIT. YOU'RE STILL ON ME WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET MUTED RIGHT NOW. A NEED. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES WE CAN DR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR QUESTION WE ARE AWARE OF THE BACKLOG IN THE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS- OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED TO REQUIREMENTS- THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED TO US BY THE STATE OUT OF THE CONTRACT WHICH IS YOU KNOW PERFORMING THE ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS. RECEIVING THE COMPLAINTS AND ALSO THERE'S OTHER- REPORTS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT'S OUR FIRST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WORK IS COMPLETED GOING OVER. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BACKLOG IS. WE'LL DO OUR BEST. TO RIP. A RELIEF THAT I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK WITH YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION EXACTLY ON THE TIME LINE FOR THAT AS I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION FRONT OF ME. BUT I KNOW WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR YES A TIME LINE WOULD BE MOST APPRECIATED- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE MAY SEE A RESEARCH IN THE FALL AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO. ABSOLUTELY HAVE MORE INFORMATION I APPRECIATE THAT. AND IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN ADD FROM CITY P. H. ABOUT. LA COUNTY AND HOW WE CAN PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO AREAS AS BIG AS LA COUNTY ESPECIALLY WITH OUR OWN LICENSING PROCESS. HI YES THIS IS HEIDI STEINER PERSONAL CD PH YES SIR WHEN I WAS APPOINTED HERE DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FOR QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT WE DO HAVE TO EAT. A LARGE BACKLOG MAINLY IN LA COUNTY BUT HE WAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE DID A DEEP DIVE AND ACTUALLY HAD A WHOLE PROJECT ON THIS LAST YEAR OF LOOKING AT WHAT WERE SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES AND THERE WERE SEVERAL ROOT CAUSES AND IT WAS NOT. YOU KNOW LA COUNTIES- I DON'T WANT IT IT WASN'T ANY BLAME TO BE IT BUT HE WAS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DID BE CONTRACTUALLY GET YOUR WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY CONTRACTING FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK LOAD AND LOOKS DOING TIME STUDIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE PUT TO GET ABLE TO PROVE IT MANAGEMENT AND- IT'S CALLED DEBT TWENTY FREE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TO REDUCE THE DEBT BY. WORRY TWENTY NINE WITH THE ORIGINAL GOAL IN MY DE SECOND QUARTER NOW SINCE WE HAD THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER. OR THE PANDEMIC HERE WE WERE CLOSE TO A- IN JUST OF MY AFTER WE HAD INPUT. ALREADY PRODUCTS. I'M INSTREAM. CREATING MORE CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS THE BOARD WE ACTUALLY HAD A REDUCTION OF 23% OF OUR BACKLOG COMPLAINT BACKLOG. I CHECKED ON IT YESTERDAY- BUT BECAUSE IT IN TAKES AND- OTHER WORK THAT WE'VE AFFECTS SEEN ON I THINK WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT. REDUCTION OF OUR OVERALL BACKLOG. BUT WE ARE GOING FULL FORCE WITH GOING BACK WITH THOSE PLANS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE- BACK THROUGH JANUARY FEBRUARY- THE AND WE HAD A WHOLE PLAN IN PLACE IT WAS ALSO APPROVED BY CMS IN IT WE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON. LAND SO- WE'RE AWARE OF IT AND WEHAVE ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TOWARD REDUCING NAPA. I THINK THAT ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD ALSO FROM THIS KIND OF WHICH IS THAT MOBILE. APPS THAT I WAS DESCRIBING YOU MEAN OUR OUR WORK ELECTRONICALLY SO THAT NOT ONLY IS THAT GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR LOVED ONES OUT THERE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IS BEING FOUND AT THESE FACILITIES. BUT USING THE MOBILE APP AND THE ELECTRONIC AUTOMATED ON DESKTOP THAT FORMED. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING A LOT OF OUR WORK THROUGH PAPER AND MANUAL PROCESSES SO BY UPDATING OUR SYSTEM. I'M TO BE MORE AUTOMATED- AND BE ABLE TO HAVE- USE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE BILL TO GO OUTSIDE BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION BACK. IT'S DISABILITIES AS WELL AS BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THOSE- WHO INTERESTED PARTIES WHO WANT TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO. THAT'S THE BEST UPDATE THAT I HAVE A FIRST LINE AS WELL AS WITH STRATEGIES FOR USING. THANK YOU AND JUST FOLLOW UP THERE IS THIS THE- WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT LICENSED FACILITIES DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ON UNLICENSED. FACILITIES AND WHAT WE ARE DOING TO. ADDRESS FIRST THE UNLICENSED PART. AND SECONDLY THE- DEEP CONCERNS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE AS- ANALYSTS. SO WE CAN. THE LIGHTS FACILITIES FOR CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE LICENSED FACILITIES THOSE THE FACILITIES THAT DPH. HAS OVERSIGHT FOR BUT THE COMPLAINTS AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS AS WELL AS THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OVERSIGHT- BY THE WAY I DID DOUBLE CHECK YESTERDAY NIGHT ACTUALLY. ACCORDING TO THE CMS THE CEOS. BETWEEN OF THE- AND JUNE THIRD WE GAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CITATIONS IN OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE FACILITIES AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OF THEM. PAUL RELATED WE ALL ISSUED OUT SERVE IN NEED JEOPARDY. OF WHICH IS THE HARSHEST PENALTY FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE- THAT WE CAN GET UP AND STATE ON SITE TO MAKE SURE THE EITHER THOSE IDEAS WERE. ABATED THREE CORRECTIONS- OR WE ALSO TAKE NEXT STEPS IF NEEDED IF THE FACILITY IS NO LONGER ABLE TO. QUALITY OF CARE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OF THE ANSWERS WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO SENATOR JACKSON. NOT SURE HAVE. THIS IS WORKING THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT SHOULD I STAND TO AYE WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO DO THAT GO GO RIGHT AHEAD WELL YOU SOUND GOOD THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO STAND UP. MIGHT BE. UP TO STAND UP BECAUSE THE MIKE DOESN'T WANT TO COME DOWN TO MY SHORT LEVEL- FIRST I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU I KNOW THIS IS HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE- TO ALL OF OUR WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE FOR OUR- THE- BE FOR THOUGH I GET TO MY QUESTION- I. I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK ALL OF OUR- HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS I SHARE WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE. SENATOR DR PAN CONCERNS ABOUT THE ATTACKS BEING MADE ON OUR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WHOSE JOB IT IS-TO TRY TO KEEP US HEALTHY- AND I WANT TO GIVE A PARTICULAR SHOT OUT TO DOCTOR CODY. DOES NOT THINK RIGHT. THE FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL. OF WHY ARE WE RE OPENING OUR SOCIETY WOULD. HAVE YOUR A VACCINE AND NO TREATMENT FOR COVE OF NINETEEN. AND NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS I KNOW DOCTOR FAUCI IS ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS- BUT I KNOW DOCTOR CODY HAS BEEN A VERY VERY STRONG AND I THINK POWERFUL- IF NOT EFFECTIVE VOICE- BECAUSE AS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE SEEING THINGS REOPEN WE'RE SEEING SPIKING IN CASES- BUT I AM I APPRECIATE HER COURAGE AND HER PASSION AND HER WILLINGNESS. TO TAKE ON- SOME OF THE POWERFUL FORCES I SUSPECT MOST OF THEM ARE YOU NAMIK. BUT IN KEEPING WITH HER RESPONSIBILITIES AS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO BE AS CAUTIOUS AND IS HONEST ABOUT THE SITUATION. WHERE SHE HAS BEEN AND SO I DID PERSONALLY IN BOTH ON BEHALF OF MY- CONSTITUENTS WANT TO THANK HER. OF A PERSONALLY FOR HER EFFORTS. MY QUESTION- I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT. THE AT THE EARLIEST STAGES OF THIS FOR A PANDEMIC IT UNITED STATES ARE. CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN THE MOST- HARSHLY. IMPACTED AND OF COURSE THAT INCLUDES OUR NURSING HOMES IN PARTICULAR. IN THE DISCUSS IT WAS CLEAR THAT EARLY ON IN THIS APPLIES I THINK NOT CHARGE TO OUR NURSING HOMES BUT TO ALL FACETS OF OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS. VIRUS THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THERE WAS A LACK OF TESTING A LACK OF PPVS. AND AS A RESULT WE SAW A NUMBER OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND FIRST RESPONDERS- THE PARISH AS A RESULT- AND WE SO I HAVE SEEN SO MANY OF OUR SENIORS AND SO MANY PEOPLE IN. NURSING CARE FACILITIES ARE ALSO DIE FROM THIS FARCE- WE NOW HAVE AS I UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE IMPROVED ACCESS TO P. B. EASE WE ARE UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER ABOUT. WHAT HOW THIS VIRUS TRANSMITS IN THE A SYMPTOMATIC NATURE THAT MAKES A PARTICULARLY INSIDIOUS- I'M WONDERING IF A DOCTOR CODY PERHAPS IF YOU COULD START BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE SHORTLY. COULD TELL US AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES- WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT WILL SEE FEWER DEATHS. ARE COMING FROM OUR NURSING HOMES AND FEWER DEATHS IN GENERAL BECAUSE WORLD WEARING MASKS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ASSN THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN. PHYSICAL DISTANCING YOU SEE OUR- THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN THEIR HOME TO AN IN GENERAL AS A RESULT THE STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ALONG WITH THE TESTING. ATTEMPT TO TRACE- AND SO TOO CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTED. WOULD POSITIVELY. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION I'LL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER I THINK THAT- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS THAT WE CAN PROTECT. RESIDENTS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. IS THROUGH TESTING AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE OF COURSE. IS PREVENTION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF INFECTION INTO CONGREGATE SETTINGS WHERE REALLY EVERYONE THERE. IS AT RISK. AND BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THIS VIRUS AND WE NOW UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF ASYMPTOMATIC TRANSMISSION- THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR AB THAT THAN EVER. I ALSO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN DIE MANY OF THE STAFF WHO AT LEAST WORK AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OUR JURISDICTION- J. ARE AMONG. LOW WAGE WORKERS THEY COME FROM COMMUNITIES WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF TRANSMISSION OF COAL BED. AND SO IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE- TESTED FREQUENTLY THAT WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO TESTING- SO THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK AND PROTECT BOTH THEMSELVES AND THE RESIDENTS THAT THEY CARE FOR SO I THINK- THE REALLY IMPORTANT COLOR. PREVENT THAT AND OF COURSE. ADEQUATE P. P. AS WELL- SO THOSE ARE THE LAYERS OF THE LAYERS OF PROTECTION BUT I THINK OUR I HAVE BEEN A REALLY PROTECT- THE RESIDENTS OF BEST- AS BEST WE CAN SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR CODY UP DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION SENATOR JACKSON AYE I DID OKAY THE OTHER QUESTION GOES MORE TO THE FINAL TWO SPEAKERS MISTER CORNET AND- MISTER CHECK COULD TELL. MOM IT SEEMS IN READING THE EXCELLENT BACK FROM PAPER AND IN MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY TRYING TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE- PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH NURSING HOMES AND NURSING CARE- WE HAVE A SORT OF A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AND AS WAS MENTIONED THAT. THE PAYMENT AND THE CARE ARE ALMOST OF OPPOSITE. CONCERNS OF THESE FACILITIES GET MORE MONEY FOR NEW PATIENTS THAN THEY DO FOR THE ONES THEY ARE AND THE US OF COURSE IN THE COVERT SHOULD SHOULD CONTEXT OF THE POTENTIAL FOR BRINGING IN COVERT POSITIVE PATIENTS IS A AN INDUCEMENT- AND OF COURSE WITH URSING HOMES IN GENERAL- I AGREE THAT FOR DECADES WE HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY LAPSE. IN OUR PROTECTION ALL OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE OF POPULATION BEING OUR SENIORS AND THOSE WHO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES- I'M WONDERING IF YOU EITHER OF YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION. AS TO HOW WE LITERALLY CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT HAS UNDERFUNDED THESE HOPE HOMES MOST OF WHICH ARE FOR PROFIT AND THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY AND- FREQUENTLY THEIR EXCLUSIVE GOAL- AS PROFIT MAKING END OF ENTERPRISES. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT OF COURSE IS TO REGULATE AND PROTECT AGAINST ABUSES IN THEIR PROCESS. AND I'M WONDERING IF EITHER OR BOTH OF THEM HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE COULD AND SHOULD CONSIDER TO REALLY TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND IN THE IN THE COVERT IN POST COVERT WORLD AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON I THINK THAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS A TONY CHICKEN TELL AND CREEK CORNET. TONY YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR JACKSON'S THIS KIND OF GETS RIGHT AT THE HEART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I'M THINKING ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO THESE VERY SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS. I'M I THINK I WOULD RECOMMEND TWO THINGS ONE. I THINK OUR LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY DARN GOOD IN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE VERY PROTECTIVE OF RESIDENTS AND THEY ESTABLISH I THINK A- GOOD. MINIMUM STANDARD OF CARE. PROBLEM IS ALWAYS BEEN ENFORCEMENT. PERSON AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY HAS BEEN LAX FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN TOLERANCE OF VIOLATIONS OF MEAN EVERY ALMOST EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE HAS MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS ANYTIME IT'S- JUST. IT JUST BOUNCES ALONG CONTINUE THAT WAY- THE FAILURES ARE NOT CORRECTED IN THE LONG RUN SO I THINK. A SIGNIFICANT FOCUSED ON. GOOD AFFECTED ENFORCEMENT THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES A REGULATORS BUT AS I MENTIONED MY TESTIMONY THE RESIDENTS. OF THE RESIDENTS MORE POWER TO ENFORCE THE STANDARDS OF. THE PIE BUT THEY LIVE UNDER- DIRECTLY RATHER THAN RELYING ON OTHER PEOPLE TO DO BEFORE THE% OUTSOURCING. NEVER SAY EVEN MAYBE A LONG TERM. IS TO BRING THE- VOICE IN THE PRESIDENT X. INTO THE VALUATION OF THE CARE THAT'S GIVEN- RIGHT NOW. RESIDENTS GENERALLY DON'T OR THEY PAY VERY LITTLE FOR THEIR OWN CAN'T IT'S MOSTLY GOVERNMENT FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS. AND SO THERE'S THIS MIDDLE PERSON IN THE WAY BETWEEN. THE RECEIPT OF CARE AND THE PAYMENT FOR CARE. AND SO THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR CARE SORT OF BLINDLY NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE CARE THAT WAS DELIVERED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. IN THE RESIDENTS WHO REALLY IN THE FAMILIES KNOW WITH. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING HAVE A STAKE IN AND HOW. OF THE PERFORMANCES REWARDED. WRITING ALIGNING THE REST EXPERIENCE MORE WITH THE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO CRAIG FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMMENTS. CREEK IN YOU AND ME ALL RIGHT THERE YOU ARE THANK YOU THINK ABOUT THAT- YES AND THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON FOR THE QUESTION- I WOULD POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS- TO YOU ON THIS FIRST OF ALL IS YOU'VE HEARD- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE UNIQUE AND THAT THEY ARE ALMOST ALMOST A 100% GOVERNMENT. HEY THE 866% ABOUT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE MONEY COMES FROM MEDI CAL AND IS YOU KNOW THE MEDI CAL RATES HAVE BEEN A TORY SLEEP TO LOVE- AND THAT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS IT IS GETTING ENOUGH- OF MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM- FOR IT. TO ENHANCE IT I WOULD SAY HOWEVER HE- THOUGH THE NEXT THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE THAT IS- IS- INCLUDED IN IN THE STATE BUDGET THIS YEAR I THINK MAKE THOSE A LONG WAY GOVERNOR DESERVES CREDIT FOR WHAT HE'S DONE HERE. I HE HAS I IN THE OUT YEARS- THE INCREASES IN THE RATES THAT WILL BE PAID TO QUALITY. SO IN OTHER WORDS TO. TIED TO JUST TO FULLY. GET THE ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THE OUT YEARS. OF FACILITIES WOULD HAVE TO MEET QUALITY STANDARDS- EACH YEAR WHICH WE FULLY SUPPORT THE PROFESSION FULLY SUPPORTS THAT- TO INCREASE QUALITY- EACH EACH AND EVERY YEAR I THINK THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE DID OUT. YEAH BUT ALSO JUST POINT OUT TO YOU THAT- ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE. AND YOU HAVE A- CONVERSATION ON THE BACKLOG. GONZALEZ RAISE THE QUESTION ON THE ON THE BACKLOG IN THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES. UP THE PROFESSION FULY SUPPORTS. ALSO GETTING RID OF THOSE THAT BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS- IT IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONEAND WE SUPPORT WHAT THE STATE IS DOING IN THAT BATTLE. THE STATEMENT COUNTY LA COUNTY YOU'RE DOING IT AT ARENA. I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU THAT OF THE BACK. COMPLAINTS OF ALL COMPLAINTS THE CLINTON. PERSON BECAUSE THE- ABOUT HALF OF THEM. ARE SELF REPORTS. STILL THE LEAST OF. HAPPY WHAT AND THAT THAT IS THE SISTERS AS A COMPLAINT WE'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE COMPLAINTS I DEALT WITH THIS PLACE BUT I THINK THE MOST OF THING IS TO SUPPORT A FUNDING AND I AS I SAID THE GOT THE GOVERNOR'S FINANCING STRUCTURE. AT QUALITY. OKAY THANK YOU IN CENTER JACKSON I THINK SHE'S DONE WITH HER QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- SO AGAINST ON THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR THE PRESENTATION- WE SORT OF TALKED A BIT ABOUT- LOOKING BACKWARDS AND- RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES OF HAD WITH- LACK OF P. P. AND TESTING- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR AS- NOW IN THE STATE IS PROPOSE THAT. WE DO REGULAR TESTING- AND- SNIFFS- IT WAS TO ENSURE WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT. HAVE THE INFECTION THE TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD I THINK A IN MY OPENING REMARKS I MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE IN LIKE A LITTLE RIGHT WE ARE HAVING A RISING SPACES- THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERNED THATIN THE FALL. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SIMULTANEOUS ARISE POTENTIALLY OF CORONA VIRUS BECAUSE THESE POTENTIAL SEASONALITY TO SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT CERTAINLY AND COMBINED WITH INFLUENZA. AS WELL- SO THE USUAL FLU SEASON AS WELL SO. AS WE ARE NOW FIRST OF ALL OPENING UP WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO GREATER DEMAND FOR P. D. E. SO YOU SEE THE INCREASING FACES OPPOSITION CAN BE MORE DEMAND FOR FIFTY BY HAAS. IN OTHER TÁI OF I'M IN TEXAS SO IT IS BUT LOCATE. WILL MORE E. IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE OPENING UP TO PER. THE WORKERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. HOW ARE WE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT PP MOVING FORWARD ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT. MANDY MINISTRATION STEPS TO TRY TO SECURE A MORE RELIABLE SUPPLY PT. CRUISER CONFIDENCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SUFFICIENT PP FOR ALL OF OUR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE STAFF FOR WORKING THERE AND THEY FOR. SOME STILL THIRD FROM SONS- STAFF- DATA REPRESENT IS THE STAFF THAT- DAY THEY STILL HAVE SOME CHALLENGES OF P. E. SO. HOW WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF TV AND BY THE WAY EVERY TIME WE DO A TEST DON'T HAVE. TV AS WELL SO CAN PERHAPS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PERHAPS MISTER CORNET. CAN SPEAK TO THE- INSURANCE P. E. GOING INTO THE FUTURE- IT FOR ALL OUR NURSING HOME FACILITIES HERE FORMULA. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND WHO WOULD TO TAKE THAT FOR. PH THE P. H. MISTER. ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE. THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES I LOST CONNECTION BUT I JUST CAME BACK IN THAT'S ALRIGHT THANK YOU. DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION RELATIVE TO P. P. HOW ARE WE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE AND- CURRENTLY OF COURSE I GUESS INSURANCE THAT ALL OUR SNIFFS WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT TV FOR ALL THE PATIENTS AND STAFF. THREE THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND MY APOLOGIES FOR MY PHONE- WHO LOSING CONNECTION THERE FOR A MOMENT- SO YOU KNOW FOR PPE WE DO HAVE- WE ASK THAT EVERY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SUBMITTED A MITIGATION PLAN BY JUNE FIRST. AND ONE OF THE SIX THINGS THAT EACH FACILITY HAD TO BE ABLE TO HAS EMERGENCY PLANS FOR ONE OF THEM WAS FOR PP. AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CONTRACTS IN PLACE THAT THEY HAVE STREAMLINED SOME PLACE IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY TO REACH. COMO LACK AND TO THE STAGE FOR AN EMERGENCY PT. BOB RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE FINDING OUR SHORTAGES STILL IN GALLONS AS WELL AS SOME IN NINETY FIVE. PER GALLON WE HAVE URGED ALL FACILITIES AND AS THE CDC IF YOU- BOUGHT COUNTS THE G. WATCH. THREE YEARS SAFE. I AND NINETY FIVE WE ALSO SO GUIDANCE ABOUT OF THE THIS THAT A FOR READ AND SYSTEM FOR THAT TO DO THAT SAFELY FOR THEM TO BE READ AND THEN SEND BACK OUT. BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH- ENGINEERS THE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ON ADEQUATE PP. EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GLOBAL SHORTAGE WE PUT IN EARLY- REQUEST TO THE NATIONAL STOCKPILE THE STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE. BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED WE HAPPEN PRIORITIZING THE P. P. EAT TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND AS IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER HOW WE HAVE THAT DASHBOARD THAT ALLOW US TO SEE AN URGENT NEED IMMEDIATELY. SO IT'S A- PRETTY SO IT. NEED OR POPS UP ON THE SCREEN AS A RIDE FOR THAT DAY HE CONTACT THEM IMMEDIATELY AND MANY TIMES IS REQUESTING KEEP THE EITHER. OR SEEN IN THE- DAYS THEY MEET OUR OF. I FOR ECCENTRIC AND SO THEN WE HAVE THAT EARLY ON. KEEP TO THEN BE A MAKES THAT WE WITH EITHER THERE MAY IS THE- AND THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM THAT LIFE DASHBOARD HAS REALLY HELPED US BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BETTER WITH ALL TWELVE HUNDRED THE LADIES- WHO ARE USING THAT. OKAY SO MADE TWO PER CALIFORNIA TO MISTER ON THAT SO. SHE YOU'RE DOING A SURVEY- AT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE COMES BACK AND SAYS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BREAKS SO CAN YOU SPEAK. TO THE STATE ASSURING THAT THEY HAVE THAT SUPPLIES SO I HEARD ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS FRANKLY- GIVEN HOW SORT THE SUPPLY IS THE CHALLENGES A GETTING RELIABLE VENDORS AND SO FORTH EVEN THE STATE'S HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN THE STATES VERY LARGE AND HAS A LOT MORE STAFF. I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. CLICKING A SURVEY AND FIND OUT RESULTS THAT ARE DOWN WE NEED TO BE SURE THEY HAVE THAT P. T. E. AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT OUR WHOLE STATE SUPPLY CHAIN. HAS SUFFICIENT PP FOR OUR NURSING HOMES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PRIORITIZING THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE A HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES AND NINE INCHES AS WE OPEN UP BY THE WAY. THERE'S GONNA BE MORE DEMAND FOR PP FROM NOT JUST HEALTH FACILITIES BUT ALSO FROM VARIOUS SITES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR WORKERS AS WELL SO ARE WE WORKING THAT INTO THE ENTIRE QUESTION ON HOW MUCH PP WE NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PERHAPS THE OTHER. BUT ALSO. AND MAYBE MISS FOR ALSO TO THIS IS THAT IS THERE AN EFFORT TO PERHAPS CREATE A STATEWIDE PURCHASING POOL FOR PP- THROUGH THE STATE SO THAT SIMPLE PEOPLE EXCEPT HAVE THE ENDED ON OUR OWN. CAN BILL AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW PUT SOME MONEY INTO A POOL OR SOMETHING SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE. YOU DELIVERY SUPPORT POWER THE STATE TRY TO GET TV EVE. NURSING HOMES AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO NEED. EIGHTY NO IT'S- QUESTION. THE OF YOU KNOW PURCHASING. I KNOW THAT SOMETHING. OF DONE THAT SO FRANK. LIKE KNOW KAISER. I'M SOME OF YOUR LAW. ENTITY MAY LOOK AT YOU KNOW PP TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF POOL THEIR RESOURCES TOGETHER AND THEN INTO THE MAKE THOSE ASK. ON THE WAY THAT THE STATE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE WORKS. IS THAT FIRST- INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES MUST TRY TO- WORK WITH THEIR EXISTING SUPPLY CHAINS AS YOU HAD MENTIONED- AND THEN HOW EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WORKS IN OUR STATE IS THAT IT WOULD THEN GO TO THE COUNTY. WORK THROUGH THAT. WERE BELIEF IS THAT IT SHOULD BUBBLE OPERATE THAT LOCAL AND REGIONALLY. FIRST AND THEN IT COMES TO THE STATE. OF AS FAR AS THE STATE UP I DO KNOW THAT AS OF THIS LAST WEEKEND WHEN I WAS ASKING ARMS. THIS OFFICE FAR AS WHAT. RESOURCES WE WERE SCARE SOMEONE WE WERE STILL SCARES ON IN NINETY FIVE. AND NINETY FIVE- ALL OTHER ITEMS IT SEEMS THAT WERE ABLE TO FILL MORE OUT. LEE BUT SEE IT'S YOUR CALL. BUT IF YOU ARE SURVEY AND WE WERE. IN THE- WHAT THEY NEED. THREE YOU. ONLY REGIONAL THEN TO THE STATE. TO BE ABLE TO DUE TO ADJUDICATE THOSE. RESOURCES THAT SORT THAT IN SO WE ALSO TO. THAT TO CLOSE THAT LOOP TO MAKES THAT YOUR APPS RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST SOMEONE SAYING I NEED SOMETHING AND THEN WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY THEN. CLOSING THAT WOULD TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HE WAS A FIELD IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. AND SENATOR PAN I THINK DOCTOR GUNS AND HEISER HAS HIS HAND UP AS WELL TO OKAY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. HE HAS ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP ON THIS QUESTION. PERHAPS FOR THEN. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU SATURDAY AFTER YOUR QUESTION I REALLY APPRECIATED YOU KNOW AT A LOCAL LEVEL OF COURSE WE'RE TRYING TO COORDINATE THE PP AVAILABILITY NOT JUST TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES BUT ALSO TWO THOUSAND CIVIL UNLICENSED FACILITIES FOR MAY ALSO BE NEEDED AND WE SEE THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THIS REMAINS A VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGE. OF COURSE WORK AND IN TERMS OF WERE PROTECTION TALK ABOUT AND NINETY FIVES MEDICAL MASS AND THEN OF COURSE THESE A CLOTH FACE COVERINGS- AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCY LOOKING AT ALL THE P. B. AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTY OUR SYSTEM TO TRACK WHERE THEY'RE SHORTAGE IS- AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE CDC CAL OSHA ALLOW FOR AND THREE YEARS OF ROUGH. IN SOME OTHER MEN. AND WE WERE. RORY WHERE WE DOING IT. YOU WITH WE NORMALLY WOULD TO ATTY SUPPLY. SO WE DON'T REALLY SEE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL BUT ON A LOCAL LEVEL. EVERYBODY'S WORKING HARD TO FIND ANYWHERE- THAT CAN PROVIDE THIS PP TO US TO HELP US. IT'S A VERY COMPLEX AREA WHEN YOU LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF THE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE PROVIDE. SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T MEET SPECIFICATIONS SO THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK IN SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT'S COMING THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHANNELS. IS ACTUALLY PROTECTIVE. THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION LAST WEEK REVISED ITS CONTENTS AROUND THE USE OF MASS. AS FOR WERE ALL LOOKING AT THE DAY IF AS WE LOOK AT THOSE DIRECT GENERALLY RECOMMENDING AN EXPANSION IN THE USE OF A MASS THE RESPIRATORS. BURKE SAMPLE DIRECT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING THAT ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY OR HAS A HEALTH. CONDITION WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE COME OVER. TO WEAR A MEDICAL MASK WHERE IS GENERALLY WERE RECOMMENDING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY. TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS AND THEY'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING TO DEVELOP STANDARDS THE MANUFACTURING. FOR THOSE FACE COVERING SO THE AS PEOPLE PURCHASE THEM. WE HAD A SURE HE'D AT THEIR MEETING SOME LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF SOURCE CONTROL WHICH IS. AT I WOULD SAY WE'RE WORKING VERY WITH THE OF GOT A GOOD JOB AND COUNTY TO MEET THE SHORT TERM NEEDS OVER WERE WERE DEVELOPING SYSTEM SO WE HAVE A REAL TIME INDICATOR OF HOW WELL WE'RE DOING BUT WE'RE STILL IN A SHORTAGE THAT YOU CAN THERE'S AWFUL LOT STATE FEDERAL FREE UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN WHATEVER SPEEDED UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE UNKNOWNS THAT IS STILL COME UP IN THE FUTURE SO WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND SENATOR PAN DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS OR ADDITIONAL. MEASURES HOPING MISTER CONNECTED ALSO RIVER OKAY FIND. MR CLINTON. YES THANK THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR PAN OUT I DO DO THINK THE SUPPLY CHAINS OF CERTAINLY IMPROVED I WILL SAY TO YOU THOUGH AND I THINK FACILITIES FACILITIES ALREADY HAD CONTRACTS. WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS BUT MOST OF HAD CONTRACTS WITH MAJOR SUPPLIERS- BUT THE SUPPLIERS COULD WOULD PROVIDE THE D. E. THEY HAD CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS AND THE AND THE PP JUST WEST OF AVAILABLE HOPEFULLY AGAIN HI JAMES- COME BACK THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT IT IT'S JUST NOT THERE I MEAN PLEASE DONE BEG BORROW AND STEALING EITHER THEY CAN FIND IT IT'S JUST NOT THERE IT'S NOT THERE. FACILITY NO HAVE EVEN MANUFACTURED SOME OF THEIR OWN. AS A RESULT TO THEY'VE HAD BE IS. AS POSSIBLE ON THIS AND AS YOU HER DOCTOR TO SAY SO OF THE GUIDANCE CHANGE HAS CHANGED REGULATE ON THIS TO IN TERMSOF THE TYPE. HE HE THAT IS NECESSARY. I WOULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER THING TO YOUR INITIAL POINT TO SENATOR AND- AS YOU SAID ABOUT OPENING UP. ONE THING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT- OR FACILITIES FACILITIES VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO GET- WE OPENED FAMILY BUSINESS- WE HAVEN'T INITIATIVE IN MY ASSOCIATION ON A FAMILY HOME COMING. VISITATION EFFORT- LOOKING RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING SUGGESTIONS TO THE STATE ON THAT. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE HAVE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS- THERE'S- PLENTY OF PP AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT MORE VISITORS START COMING INTO. THE LEASE TO THE VISITATION VERY IMPORTANT IN THE CONTACT FAMILIES. BUT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE. PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE- DOES NOT RESULT IN A NEW STORAGE WITH THAT ARE WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. WHEN GUESTS SENATOR PAN RIGHT AND IT THANK YOU OF MANAGER I JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION ACTUALLY PERHAPS FOR A C. P. H. HIGH I MADE REFERENCE TO THE FALL I THINK CONCERNS ABOUT KNOWING CORONAVIRUS A SLEW OF BOTH COMPETING FOR HOSPITAL BEDS. OURS USUAL FLU VACCINATION RATE IN THE COMMUNITY IN A TYPICAL FLU SEASON SOMEWHERE AROUND 45% TO HEALTHY PEOPLE TWENTY TWENTY GOALS SEVENTY PERCENT- THOSE HOSPITAL BEDS- THAT WOULD BE SAVED BY REDUCE INCREASING ORGANIZATION RATES WOULD BE VERY USEFUL- TO. IF NECESSARY TO CARE FOR CORONAVIRUS VICTIM SO. WHAT IS CITY PH DOING TO TRY TO INCREASE THE FLU VACCINATION RATE AND OF COURSE THIS FLU AFFECTS PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES- MORE SIGNIFICANT AS WELL JUST LIKE RUN A VIRUS. SO BY INCREASING OUR COMMUNITY FLU VACCINATION RATE WE CAN HELP SAVE LIVES IN A NURSING HOMES AS WELL. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TRY TO GET OUR FLU VACCINATION RATE FROM 40% TO SEVENTY PERCENT. AND ALSO I GUESS RELATED TO THAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM CDC ABOUT EFFORTS TAX INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF FLU VACCINE BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS ONLY. PRODUCING NOW FOR USUAL IS TRYING TO HIT THE SEVENTY FIRST. AT THAT POINT TIME SO PERHAPS HE TEACH AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT'S THE PLAN TO GET US TO THAT 70% BACK WE NEED DIVERSE PEOPLE ONLY FROM FLU BUT ALL IN FRONT OF MY- AND. RIGHT I HAD THE EDITOR. THANK YOU TO PAN I'M I. THE TO LOOKING AT BECAUSE THAT SIX WHAT WE'RE DOING AS WELL- BEFORE WE EVEN HAD SLEAZE SEASON WHAT'S EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS WE HAVE TO CRISIS SEES THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO. FOR FLU THE FIRST ONE WILL BE THE PSP **** THE PUBLIC SAFETY- POWER SHUT OFF. CONCERN WITH THAT HAPPENING THIS SUMMER IN ADDITION WHILE WE'RE HANDLING THE PANDEMIC. UNCRITICALLY FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHO- FOUR HITS- HARDEST BY THOSE- PS YESES. THE SECOND ONE THAT WE ARE PREPARING FOR IS WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH WILL COME AFTER THAT MOST LIKELY IN THE LAST FEW SEASONS IT'S BEEN HITTING IN LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL- ON IN THAT MOVIE AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING. A POTENTIAL PEAK- OVER KOBE CASES- WE DID SET UP SEVERAL DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES AS YOU KNOW BACK IN THE SPRING WE'VE HAD THOSE LUCKILY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO KIND OF BEND THE CURVE WE WERE ABLE TO NOT HAVE TO USE ALL THOSE ALTERNATE CARE SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT WE STAND PREPARED TO HAVE TO USE- THOSE ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES THAT WE CREATED ACROSS THE STATE- IF NEEDED. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SAFE EVACUATION OR SAFE MEDICAL SPACES- IN THE CASE OF WILDFIRES FOR PS PS OFFENSE THAT- REQUIRE US TO MAKE SURE THAT- PATIENTS ARE TRANSFERRED TO STATE SPACES- THEN. AFTER YES YES IT IS AND AFTER WHILE FIRST SEASON THEN COMES THE FLU-AND PENDING ON WHERE OUR KIDS. CASES AND THE NINE WELL PEOPLE ARE ABIDING BY WEARING. AND DOING STATE PRACTICE WELL THERE ARE PUBLIC WE BE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I. DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL THAT IT COULD HAPPEN ANY TIME I'M ANY NON ON PEOPLES DISCIPLINE DURING THIS PERIOD OF OPENING- IN SO WITH THE FLU SEASON- I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE PUSHING VERY HARD- TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WE ARE HOPING THAT BECAUSE OF COAL THEN- AND THE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH IN GENERAL- AND ABOUT HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS ABOUT WHAT HEARD IMMUNITY IS- TAXI INS AND ALL. IS FOR NATION THAT HAS BEEN REALLY TAKING A DIFFERENT SPENT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF REPENT AND MAKE. WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT WILL NOT ONLY HEIGHTENED THE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS LEVEL OF THE IMPORTANCE OF A FLU SHOT- BUT WE ARE HOPING THAT WILL ALSO RESULT IN A MORE PEOPLE- GOING TO GET THEIR FLU SHOT- AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE- THAT- THAT EDUCATION OUT. TO THE PUBLIC. AS FAR AS THE CDC I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION- REGARDING IF FOR ANY GOING TO BE ANY VOLUMES OR AMOUNTS OF THE FLU. VACCINE FROM SEE IF I CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK TO WEAR SCIENCES BRANCH YOU HAS CONNECTIONS THE CDC AND GET BACK TO OFF LINE. THANK YOU I DO POINT OUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO WE NEED TO HAVE TO SUPPLY IMAGINE WE CREATED THE DEMAND AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPLY THE SAME ISSUE RANTED. BUT P. E. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE ALSO RAN INTO A TESTING- WE'RE GOING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE WE ALSO NEED HISTORY SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FLU VACCINES IN PLACE. SO THAT PEOPLE GET IT WHEN WITH A THEY WANTED TO INDEED ITSELF. THANKS VERY MUCH OF DIRTY MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE STATIC OR- ADDRESSING THE PS PS THE WILD PARK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT MOVING FORWARD. APPS I COULD ASK. CRAIG ON THIS RECORD THAT JUST A BIT THE- IT IN IN TERMS UP AS THESE P. S. P. S. HOPEFULLY- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THOSE THIS YEAR BUT- I KNOW HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY WE HAVE TO PREPARE- WHAT KIND OF PREPARATIONS TO THESE- THIS THIS THIS IS THIS INDUSTRY MAKING TO PROTECT TH MOST POR EL AMOUNTS AS THAT THAT LIVE IN THOSE HOMES PARTICULARLY IN THIS COVERED NINETEEN- ERA THAT. THAT WERE IN AND SEGREGATING THOSE PATIENTS IN KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. MR CORNET YES I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER DOT- I WOULD I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT FACILITIES FACILITIES HAVE VERY ROBUST- AYE AYE MERCHANTS THE PLANNED- EIGHT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS ARENA THEY ARE THEY ALL DO- WE ARE- NUMEROUS- ONGOING EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO TAP THE PHILLIES UPDATE THOSE PLANS AND TO GET ON THAT BEST GUIDANCE ABOUT WORKING THERE AT WITH THEIR LOW AGENTS OPERATIONS SEEK H. R. THAT IS A ROUTINE ONGOING- THING THEY ALL ALL FACILITIES ALSO. I HAVE TO MAINTAIN AB GENERATORS IN CASE OF A POWER LOSS- AS WELL- SO I TAKE IT. AS AS YOU WELL AT YOU A DEADLY NOTE DURING THE RIGHT THIS PARADISE FIRE THREE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT BURNED TO THE GROUND IN PARADISE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER. FACILITIES TO ALL NOT A SINGLE RESIDENT- OUR STAFF PERSON WAS A- WAS HARD AND THOSE THAT HORRIFIC- A DISASTER- AND I THINK IT BOB IS THE LEAVES ARE ARE ARE YOU KNOW WELL PREPARED- GOING FORWARD AND I GUESS IT THIS IS THE PRIORITY OBVIOUSLY- EVERY KNOWING THAT- THE FIRE SEASON IS. IS UPON US AND WE'LL BE RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU AND SENATOR DODD DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU OKAY. WE WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR WINNER AND THEN SENATOR BATES. I THANK YOU. VERY MUCH- SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE- ALL- AGREE LEARN THE THOUGHT ABOUT IS OF THE- A LOT OF IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE VULNERABILITY. OF OUR RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES CODE ISN'T THE ONLY THREAT THERE ARE OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IT'S REALLY. SHOWN SOME OF THE VULNERABILITIES WHICH WE CAN OF COURSE WORK TO IMPROVE WITH SUMMER FUNDAMENTAL. AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ONLY GOING TO NURSING HOMES IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY. ESSENTIAL NO WE'RE NOT FORCING PEOPLE INTO NURSING HOMES AND WE CAN AVOID IT. WITH SMART INVESTMENTS- IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET BY THE ADMINISTRATION THEIR CUTS TO THE OKAY THEIR HEALTHCARE. BY TO ASSESS SO FOR THESE ARE CRITICAL SERVICES. THAT HELP KEEP. ARE VULNERABLE. IN THEIR HOMES. INDEPENDENCE OR AT LEAST MORE INDEPENDENT- AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING THE GOVERNOR I DISAGREE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPRESSED THAT THIS AGREEMENT WITH THESE CUTS. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE DOES NOT WANT TO BE CUTTING THESE WERE A TERRIBLE SITUATION. BUT THESE ARE CRITICAL CRITICAL SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID GOING INTO NURSING HOMES- WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN. SO IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON JUST YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WHAT KIND OF SMART INVESTMENTS WE CAN BE MAKING. AND PROTECTING TO KEEP SENIORS OUT OF NURSING HOMES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU AND SENATOR WIENER WAS THAT DIRECTED TOWARD ANYONE SPECIFICALLY OR WHATEVER OKAY. THANK YOU N. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT UP. WE HAVE CRAIG. OKAY THANK YOU. I'LL START THAT ONE DOES- STARTED WINNER OF AND I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS PROFESSION- HAS NEVER HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED AND CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE THAT- THAT OUR SENIORS AND THAT SHOULD BE IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT POSSIBLE IF THAT'S IN A IF AT SOME SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THAT'S AT HOME WITH MY HSS ARE SOME OF THE- PERFORMANCE HOME HEALTH CARE IF THAT'S AN ASSISTED LIVING THAT IS WHATEVER IS MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING IT POSSIBLE. I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION ON THIS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TWO WEEKS AGO- OUTLINED A NEW PUZZLE BUT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO HEIDI MIGHT COMMENT ON THIS BUT- TO LOOK AT A LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFIT- FOR NEXT YEAR MEDI CAL- BETTER THAT I THINK IT JUST IN ITS INFANCY SO I YOU KNOW MY OFFICE MY BACK ALONG WITH OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. THE LACK THAT SOME OF THE BUDGET. WE UNDERSTAND. THE DEPTH JOB. AND IN CRAP A BUDGET THIS. BUT UP. BUT I JUST WANT TO BE BE CLEAR THAT THE PROFESSION IS NOT. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BY ANY STRETCH. OF THE FOLKS WHO COME TO OUR FACILITIES IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THEY HELP THE THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. MORE AND MORE- PEOPLE ARE STAYINGHOME LONGER. AND WHEN THEY GET TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THEY TEND TO BE MUCH OLDER AND MUCH MORE FRAIL. THAT HAS ALSO BEEN ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS WE FOUND IN KOBE IT IS BY THE TIME THEY GET TO OUR FACILITIES THEY ARE VERY HEALTH COMPROMISED. AND MUCH OLDER THAN THEY WERE MAYBE. TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO. SO WE LOOK FOR TO THAT DIALOGUE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BACK. STATE IS TALKING. THANK YOU MISTER QUINN AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT FROM MR CHICKEN TELL. THANK. YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR- QUESTION SENATOR WIENER- CANTOR DEFINITELY AND THE WHOLE OF RESIDENT COMMUNITY- HAS HAS TAKEN A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS IT'S AT LEAST ON THE COMMUNITY SERVICE. YOUR VITAL TO KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING HOMES WHICH IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL THAN NORMAL AT THIS TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC WERE SO MANY PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE LIVING SEVEN. OUR OUR ENTIRE RACE I'M YOU WHAT'S WHAT WAS REALLY STRIKING TO US IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS CONTRASTING THE HOME HEARING BASED SERVICE CUTS. THERE WERE PROPOSED WITH ALL THE MONEY THAT WE'VE BEEN GROWING OVER TO NURSING HOMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS. EVER BILLION DOLLARS NO STRINGS ATTACHED. THE NURSING HOMES ANOTHER STATE IS PROPOSING TO DO SIMILAR STUFF- I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH. THE SYSTEMREIMBURSEMENT THAT WE HAVE TO OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM IS ABOUT THE PRE AUTHORIZED THIS MONTH BY THE. LEGISLATURE AB SIXTY TWENTY NINE. WE CAN STICK YEAR OFTHIS. SYSTEM THAT HAS HAS GIVEN US A LOT SELF. BILLION OWNERS WHO COULD BE CAN BE ANY LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE RESIDENTS WE NEED TO- WE NEED TO TIE THIS MONEY INTO A SACK MINIMUM STAFFING LEVELS. AND TO MORE QUALITY MR CLINTON MENTIONED IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE RACES OR SOME OF THE FUNDING GHOST SHIP QUALITY CARE MEASURES. BUT BUT THOSE MEASURES OR SELF REPORTED BY THE FACILITIES AND IT'S JUST A SMALL FRACTION IN THE RESIDENT INPUT IN THIS QUALITY. IT IS NOT CONSIDERED AT ALL- SO I THINK IT'S REALLY TIME TO. TO RETHINK THIS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. TO MAYBE DO A ONE YEAR CATCH ON THE WAY WE FIND NURSING HOMES AND TO SPEND THIS YEAR RECONSIDERING FUNDAMENTALLY. ALWAYS HOW WE CONNECT THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING THE BETTER QUALITY BECAUSE THE RESIDENTS TO SERVE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHECK TELL AND I THINK SENATOR WIENER IS DONE WITH HIS QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU YOU CAN HEAR ME I HOPE YES. I DO WANT TO CONCUR WITH US SENATOR JACKSON AND SENATOR- POUNDS COMMENTS REGARDING OUR BY HEALTH OFFICERS OF THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION WITH DOCTOR QUICK WAS IN MY COUNTY AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHILE I WAS A SPENDING MOST OF MY TIME IN THE DISTRICT ON SENATOR AMINO DOCTOR QUICK. ON MONDAY WEDNESDAY OF EVERY WEEK WAS PROVIDING THE ORANGE COUNTY DELEGATION WITH UPDATES ON OUR PROGRESS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC SHE DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB THE ISSUE THE HOUSE REALLY CIRCULATED AROUND. THE FACEMASK ISSUE AND NOT TO DEBATE OUT HERE- THAT SOMETHING THAT I THINK MORE EDUCATION ON NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE YEAH WHAT A GOOD IDEA I FRANKLY I JUMPED ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ONE SO I WOULDN'T BE TOUCHED MY FACE IT WAS GREAT ENTER. BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE SHE'S AGREED ON HEALTH OFFICER AND I'M SURE A GREAT CAREER STILL WAITS- SO THANKS TO THAT BUT BUT WE SHOULD GIVE THEM. SUPPORT CAN AS A- THEY'RE THERE TO PROTECT US. I MIGHT MIGHT. IN MY CLASS ARE SPECIFIC OF. THE SIX ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH BY A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENTOF PUBLIC HEALTH- TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY- ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN OUR OFFICE OF. ANY OF SUB THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN PARTICULAR I WAS TAKEN BY THE COMMENTS BY A DOCTOR NEWS AND HOW OUR- REGARDING AT THE NUMBER OF- FACILITIES THAT ARE IN IN HIM LA COUNTY THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE PLAN AND SUBMITTED IT TO THE STATE. AND OUT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TO ENTER SEVENTY OF BEING COMPLETED WHICH LEAVES A LITTLE OVER FORTY THAT STILL HAVE NOT. THAT WAS DUE ON JUNE FIRST PERHAPS BY JUNE TENTH. AND THAT THE FIRST THREE ELEMENTS ARE PROBABLY FUNDAMENTAL TO INSURING- THAT THE INFECTION RATE IN OUR SNAPS GOES DOWN AND OUT THE VULNERABLE WITH MOST FACILITIES ARE PROTECTED. BUT AS IMPORTANTLY THE STAFF AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU A VERY QUICK A SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO A CONSTITUENT OF MINE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS A STAFFER ON TRNA A IN A- YOU KNOW WE CAN. AT THE YOUNG AGE OF FONG IN EARLY THIRTY. WITH ELEVEN OLD AT HOME SHE CONTRACTED THAT IN THE FACILITY AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE TESTED. NOR WERE THEY ALLOWED TO WEAR A P. P. E. THAT WAS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY FELT IT WOULD BE FRIGHTENING. TO THOSE IN THE FACILITY AND CERTAINLY VISITORS THAT WERE STILL ALLOWED AT THAT TIME. SO THERE'S A TIMING ISSUE HERE AND I'M CERTAINLY VERY AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE THIS IS EARLY AND NOW- THE- PANDEMIC ARE IMPACTS ON YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING HOMES THE HOT SPOTS WERE NOT NECESSARILY TO FIND AT THAT TIME. BUT GOING FORWARD WE'VE LEARNED AND THAT CERTAINLY THE GENESIS OF THE SIX ELEMENTS. BUT TO HAVE FORTY WHO ARE SHORT AS OF JUNE FIRST IN MEETING THAT PLAN IS CONCERNING BECAUSE- THOSE COULD BE THE VERY FACILITIES WERE A LOT. COULD HAVE BEEN THE HOT SPOTS SOME OF THOSE ARE FEATURE. BY THE WAY ON THE LA MEDIA. OR I'D LIKE TO ASK DOCTOR. HELGESEN HAUSER- IF HE COULD RESPOND TO WHAT WE DO OR WHAT THEY DO WELL WITH THOSE WHO ARE DELAYED OR ARTIFICIALLY MEETING ALSO. BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE A LOT OF MORE RESOURCES NEED TO GO TO OUR- OUR- THE STAFF ARE ARE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HERE A CALIFORNIA. BUT THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUE OF I WANT XIN THAT I WAS SO WORKER. ME HERE'S A WHEN THEY ACCOUNTS MY ASSIGNED WAS OF NURSING AT THAT TIME A LOT THEY'VE MADE A LOT A LOT OF PROGRAMS SCHOOLS WERE VERY DARK DAYS. BUT WE STILL HAVE THE PROBLEMS AND UNLESS THERE'S ENFORCEMENT IN ITS VERY. ARE STRICT IN SEVERE IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS WE PUT STAFF. AND WE PUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE REALLY YOU KNOW IT IS THE EXTREME DANGER- INCLUDING LOSING THEIR LIVES AND CERTAINLY AFFECTING THEIR FAMILIES. SO I'D LIKE TO CAMP- THE DOCTOR SHARE WITH US YOU KNOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS AND THE PASSION WITH WHICH THEY ARE REALLY FOLLOWING. UP ON IN PARTICULAR THE ONE TWO THREE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ANSWER TO ENSURING THAT. GOING FORWARD- THESE INDIVIDUALS AND STAFF FULL CERTAINLY FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN DOING THEIR JOB AND MAYBE WE WON'T HAVE SO MUCH PROBLEM WITH THE STAFFING ISSUE. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- DOCTOR GOES AND CONSENT HEISER. THANK YOU SATURDAY TO REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON WITH ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED. THE ISSUES OF TESTING HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY- I CAN SEE EVERYONE KNOWS THE NATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WERE FACED I BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS. THERE WERE EXTREMELY EFFORTS MADE BY OUR BOARD. AND ALSO BY THE MAYOR LA CITY TO DEVELOP TESTING CAPACITY HERE IN LA COUNTY- THEY INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT TO CONTRACT OR WORK WITH LOCAL LABORATORIES. SO THAT WE WEREN'T RELIANCE ON THE NATIONAL SUPPLIER ON SOME OF THE NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND HAD HUGE AROUND. SO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR TESTING UP THROUGH THOSE- CAPACITIES INTO THE THOUSANDS PER DAY. WHICH WOULD WHICH PUT US AHEAD OF A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS AND ONCE WE SAW THAT. MELODY AND WE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AS A KEY TOOL AND ASSURING SAETY AND NURSING HOMES- WE DISCARDED THE TAP IN THE BACK. AND THAT WAY WE RAN INTO A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES OF LIKE WHO'S GOING TO DO THE REGISTRATION WHAT STAFF AND DO IT HOW DO WE MOVE IT. HOW DO WE GET THE RESULTS BACK AND CENTER THE JUST THE LOGISTICS. OF DEPLOYING AVAILABLE TEST INTO THESE NURSING FACILITIES TO SOMETHING NEVER DONE BEFORE. I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY HAVE GOT GOT THAT DONE WELL. I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE STATEFOR THE BASELINE TESTING IS. JUNE THIRD THERE WAS A AND I FELT IT WAS PUT OUT FEW WEEKS AGO THAT SAID THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THIS BASELINE TESTING AND THEN GOING SURVEILLANCE THERE WASN'T A DAY BUT LATER THE STATE CLARIFY IT WAS JUNE THIRTIETH BASED ON THE ORIGINAL GUIDANCE. A WE SET A GOAL TO COMPLETE THAT BASELINE TESTING AND COMPLETE ALL ROUTE BREAK TESTING. BY JUNE NINETEEN WHICH IS. A WEEK FROM THIS FRIDAY. IN TERMS OF THE FORTY THAT ARE LEFT WE EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE DONE WITHIN A WEEK WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE ALMOST ALL OF THEM. BY THIS FRIDAY. SO WILL ACTUALLY MEET OUR- WILL BE A BETTER THAN OUR JUNE NINETEENTH DEADLINE WILL CERTAINLY BE DONE. THE STATE DEADLINE- HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD WE'VE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY I WOULD SAY SUCCESSFUL AND GET MEETING THAT I WISH WE COULD HAVE DONE EARLIER THE CHALLENGES WERE HAUNTING WE WORK OUT A SOLUTION. I WOULD IMAGINE MANY OTHER COUNTY IS A REALLY CHALLENGE WE DO HAVE SOME RESOURCES WE'VE- REASSIGNED STAFF AS WE CAN. WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW TEAMS THAT GO OUT TODAY I'VE GOT OVER EIGHT. FACILITIES THAT WERE CASTING AND WE'RE HAVING STAFF. IT'S A VERY I LIVE A RESOURCE INTENSIVE PROCESS TO GET THAT DONE I IMAGINE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THAT AVAILABLE. SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO START TO LOOK AT HOW A SUPPORT CAN BE PROVIDED- TO MEET THAT NEED. AND I AND I SO I COMMENTED IT HAS. BEEN NOTICEABLE AT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS HAVE GONE DOWN I DO THINK THAT THE THREE MAIN THINGS THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. SOURCE CONTROL THAT EVERYBODY IN THE FACILITY THE MORNING A MASK OR RESPIRATOR. SECOND OF ALL THE TESTING. INFORM WHO NEEDS TO BE COLD HEARTED SO WE'VE GOT THE INFECTED PEOPLE HERE THE- THE EXPOSED HERE. AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN EITHER INFECTED OR EXPOSED SOMEWHERE ELSE NEW PEOPLE SHOULD GO INTO A QUARANTINE UNTIL WE'RE SURE THAT THEY ALL OF THOSE RISKS. AND THEN- THE THIRD ELEMENT IS UP. IS THAT ISOLATION QUARANTINE BUT IF WE DO THOSE WELL. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THAT THE CASES ARE REALLY DROPPING EXTRAORDINARILY. THE ISSUE OF WORKER. LIKE YOU SAID USING. IMPORTANT WE'VE WE'VE WITH. TOP PEOPLE WORK THE FISCAL. AND THEY WANT TO BE WELL EDUCATED THEY WANT UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IS GOING TO PROTECT THEM THE PEOPLE THERE CARING FOR. AND THAT THEY'VE GOT THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES PARTICULARLY THE BP. TO SAFEGUARD THEMSELVES I FEEL WE ARE QUICKLY MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THAT ONE TWO AND THREE THAT YOU MENTIONED WHICH I DO THINK FOR THE CRITICAL STEPS. AND I WILL HOPEFULLY BE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE- DOCTOR CODY MENTION THAT AND- SANTA CLARA COUNTY THEY'VE REALLY SEEN A MARKED DECREASE. HOPEFULLY OTHER COUNTY FROM MOVING TO THAT PLACE SOON AS WELL AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTION GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND SENATOR BATES I THINK- WE HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTORS. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT IF. HI THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- I AM SO SORRY THAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBER BUT IT IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN EARLY ON IN THE CAN DOWN MAKE IN THAT. IN THAT IS THE CASE OF YEAR. NOT ONLY FEAR IAN ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS- WHO WE DID- ESTABLISH SOME FREE HOTEL ROOMS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT THEY CAN DECONTAMINATE THE COULD HAVE A PLACE TO STAY PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE HOME LIKE IN YOUR CASE ELEVEN MONTHS STATE THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT- TRYING TO CREATE AS MANY WRAPAROUND SERVICES. CAN ALLEVIATE THOSE FEARS THIS IS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- BUT THE FEAR ISRAEL BOTH FOR EITHER THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AS WELL AS OUR EVALUATORS GOING INTO FACILITIES- AND I THINK THAT. THE KINGDOM BECAUSE GO ON LINE AND PEOPLE STILL MORE AND WE HAVE MORE PP. OR. SENATE AND THAT IS A POWER. TO HOLD STILL HERE FOR DURING THIS. I DO WANT TO. AND LA. IN THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ALSO THE MITIGATE PLANS THE MITIGATION PLANS WERE TO JUNE FIRST. WE HAD A FEW STRAGGLERS BUT AS OF LAST WEEKEND- WE HAD A 100% OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO SUBMIT THEIR MEDICATION PLANS. OUR TEAMS ARE NOW REVIEWING THOSE AND GOING ON SITE. THEY WILL BE GOING ON SITE EVERY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS- TO REVIEW AND IT'S HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAUDIS ARE FOLLOWING UP. WITH WHAT THEY STATED THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IN THEIR MEDICATION PLANS. IN THE CREE WITH EVERYONE WHO WAS SPOKEN TODAY REGARDING TESTING. TESTING IS REALLY REALLY THE KEY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THE FLEA. AND GET WHATEVER NEW NORMAL IN OUR SOCIETY WE MAY HAVE. AND WOOD TESTING PARTICULARLY WITH WITH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES% WE RECENTLY LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEK. HAVING CREATING COUNTY TESTING MEDICATION PLANS. ARE COUNTY SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND THEY'LL HAVE OPTIONS WE DO HAVE A LINK OR- PHP. WEBSITE THAT HAVE THIS ALL THE POTENTIAL LABS IN THE STATE- I'M COUNTY STATE. PRIVATE LAPSED ACADEMIC CALL LITTLE RESEARCH LABS. I TO THAT'S- WHAT TESTING CAN DO THEIR AS WELL AS WHAT TYPES OF. YEAH SERVICE ALL EVEN DO MOLD LABS OR SOMETHING HAVE DRY THROUGH TOWN SOME LABS LACK DO IS AND WHERE THEY WATCH COME SPECIMENS BRING THEM TO THE LAB AND WE PROVIDE ALL THAT IN OR A LINK AND THAT'S PART OF OUR A THAT WE SENT OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND EDUCATION. NOT JUST. HOW CAN I TEST IN NEWS MEDIA LAB THAT SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY BUT THERE TURN AROUND TIME MAYBE FASTER THAN WHAT IS THE CLOSEST LEFT TO ME AND SO TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK- USING LOOKING AT THAT WHOLE LIST OF WITH THE TURNAROUND TIMES ARE CLASSICS THAT TRUCK AS IT THEY CAN HAVE THE INFORMATION AND BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT MIGHT WORK THE BEST FOR THEM BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE TESTING CAPACITY IN OUR STATE NOW. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING DECISIONS ON WHICH WAY WHICH PASSWORD WOULD BE THE BEST FOR THEIR FACILITY TO BE ABLE TO TEST. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. WHEN ART ONE LAST QUESTION FOR OUR DAILY COUNTY I IN TERMS OF- REPORTING- PROCEDURE IF THERE ARE I WOULD SAY- DEFICIENCIES- IS THERE A- EFFICIENT AND CONFIDENTIAL WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM OF THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE IN NURSING HOMES THAT FEEL THERE'S SOME SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES PUTTING PUBLIC- THE HEALTH OF THE STAFF FOUND OF THE MEMBER THE OF PATIENTS AT RISK- SOMETHING I THINK HAS BEEN INSTITUTED. FOR OTHER ISSUES- IN THE WORKPLACE BUT I THINK SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S A CONFIDENTIAL OPPORTUNITY TO REPORT SO THAT THE MEDIA AT OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT IF NEEDED- COULD COME ONLINE. I THANK YOU SENATOR BATES AGAIN FOR THAT QUESTION. I AM AWARE OF THAT OUR HEALTH FACILITIES DOES HAVE A PROCEDURE WHERE THEY CAN- ACTUALLY RECEIVED COMPLAINTS DIRECTLY- FOR WORKERS- AND THEY COULD INVESTIGATE DOES IS NEEDED. I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY COMPLETELY COMPLIES WITH SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS SO FOLKS OKAY WITH YOU ALL A LTTLE MORE INFORMATION AND PROVIDE THAT BACK TO YOU EXACTLY WHAT THE DETAILS ARE OF THE SYSTEM HERE IN LA COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT IS ALL THANK YOU SENATOR BATES WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL AS I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. HERE THAT HERE TODAY THAT PRESENTED- APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK AND THE OUTSTANDING COORDINATION THAT THIS CORONA VIRUS HAS. FIRST ASSAULT TO UNDERGO. ON BECAUSE THE STATE TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION LIVES WERE SAVED AND I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE QUESTION SEEMS AS IF THEIR CRITICISM. BUT I REALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME DURING A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND KNOW THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE INTO THE FUTURE. SO HOPEFULLY WE'RE KEEPING TRACK OF THOSE- ONE OF THEM WHICH REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS HEARING EXCEPT FOR THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE LACK OF TESTING AND THE LACK OF PP. I REPRESENT A RURAL DISTRICT BOB GRAHAM FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OVER TO THE SALINAS VALLEY. AND PEOPLE ARE SCARED AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WORK ARE. AND I THINK WE. TROLL ARE OWN FUTURE WHICH IS TO FIGURE A WEEK PRODUCE OUR OWN P. HERE THE STATE WOULD BE GREAT A BUT SUCH FOR THE CONVERSATION THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT. THAT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT AND I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN OUT ANSWERED SO I'LL I'LL I'LL DO REAL QUICK AND- REALLY WITH THE PUBLIC. WANTS TO KNOW IS FAR THEIR LOVED ONE SAFE. AND SO THE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO KEEP THEIR- THE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAT HE IS. IN THE FACILITY SAFE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND BY THE SAME TOKEN- I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO ISOLATE AND AT TO RESTRICT WHO GOES INTO THE FACILITIES. BUT IT- IT IT'S BACK I GUESS THE QUESTION IS- UNDER WHAT SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT BE SAFE TO ALTER THAT PARTICULAR RESTRICTION TO ALLOW. ON A FAMILY MEMBER TO VISIT. USING GOOD SCIENCE- BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT MANY OF THE- RESIDENTS ARE FRAGILE. AND THEY DEPEND ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO COME IN AND MAKE THEIR DAY. OUT MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND THE STAFF DOES TOO AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE IF SOME THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO. WHAT KIND OF CHANGES MIGHT MY HELP. THAT STEM BECAUSE WE HEARD SUCH A XIN WERE. HAVING MEMBERS WELL I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THE SENIORS THAT I KNOW ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND HAVE BEEN SO. WHERE NO CAN VISIT. AND SEPARATED THE FAN. THANK YOU AND I HAD QUESTION AS WELL I MISTER SALAD MENTIONED THE RESIDENT BEING MORE EMPOWERED IN THIS PROCESS SO- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS ANYONE SENATOR COMING IT'LL BUT- ACTUALLY RESEARCHER TELLS RAISING HIS HAND. AREAS AND THEN CREEK WHEN IT IS NEXT. FOR YOUR QUESTIONS I'M VERY GOOD ONES ARE REALLY GOOD ABOUT A VISITATION BUT LET ME GET WHAT THE BIG QUESTION ARE ARE ARE ARE WE'RE LOOKING SAFE. I'M THERE'S NO WAY TO ANSWER THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH FACILITY AND I GUESS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT IS SORT OF THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. WE CAN'T WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN'T GUARANTEE IT. AND I THINK EVEN PRIOR TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. THAT QUESTION WITH THE ANSWER QUESTIONS ON CERTAIN WHICH SHOULD BE ALARMING TO US. WE HAVE A RECENT G. A. L. FEDERAL GAO STATUS SENATE ONE THIRD OF RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOME SUFFERS HARM. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF THEIR STAY. SO THESE ARE FREE DANGEROUS PLACES ARTICLE THE NINETEEN. I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORTS AND TO MAKE THEM SAFER AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNANSWERED. WITH HER TO VISITATION. THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CASUALTIES OF THE PANDEMIC WAS WAS VISITORS AND IT'S BEEN HEARTBREAKING AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE'S A REAL RATE PUBLICHEALTH JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EXCLUSION OF VISITORS BECAUSE THIS- SO MANY VISITORS PROVIDED DIRECT CARE SUPPLEMENTED THE CARE THAT IS PROVIDED BY SEVENTY SENSUAL CARE TURNING RESIDENTS MAKING SURE THAT. MAKING SURE THEY WERE BAD I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WHO HAD ENTERED THE TIMES IT CAREFULLY EITHER LOCAL ONE AND THEIR NOT SO SURE THIS THAT HAVE AT THAT TIME IN COMPARISON. DO THAT WITH A LOT OF RESIDENTS RIGHT SUFFERING FROM LIKE ON DO NEGLECT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SUFFERING FROM BEHIND YOU ISOLATION A LOT OF STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES YOU HAVE STARTED TO OPEN UP ON THIS NO I'M ASKING YOU JUST LET. CAN YOU. ARE VISITORS TO DO JOHN THIS THING MEASURES THIS. WE PROPOSE THE- INCOME. BUT CLEARLY THIS. OPENING UP VISITATION SOME. LIMITED RESEARCH. BUT FINALLY. HAS NOT BEEN A PRIORITY I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE COME A- THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE MISTER CORNET. YES THANK YOU- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AND THEIR COPYRIGHT I. IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THAT THE SURVEYORS THE FOLKS FROM C. T. H. AND THE PART AND THE LA PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE BEEN VISITING FACILITY. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE THE APP IS TIRED TIME- THE ISSUE OF VISITATION AND PARTICULARLY FAMILY VISITING THERE'S A NATURAL TENSION HERE I THINK- AT IN TERMS OF- I'VE HAD TO MAKE THIS WORKABLE I WILL TAKE YOU THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CREATIVE THINGS THAT ALREADY. OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN USED UTILIZING FACE TIME- OR OR ARE. THEY JUST TYPING- SO THEY'RE THEY'RE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES- AND VERY MUCH **** AND COMMUNICATE. ALSO JUST. SAM THAT PRESENTS A OUR OUR CHAO TO. YOU A YUBA AND I PAY OR A LOT FROM ROOM TO ROOM IT HAS TO BE JUST EVERY TIME- EVERY TIME WITH WILL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT- POTENTIALLY- INFECTING SOMEONE OF RIGHT NOW THOUGH THERE ARE OTHER FACILITIES HAVE BEEN DOING- OUTDOOR- SETTING UP OUTDOOR VISITATION- AND IN IN IN SOMETIMES EVEN IN PARKING LOTS OR EVEN ARE IN THAT IN IN THE OUTDOOR AREAS OF THE TO STILL BE I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE AT THAT- THE- AT THIS POINT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE SUGGESTING. YOU KNOW SOME DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE FACILITY AND THE OUT BREAK ISSUES POTENTIALLYSOME ADDITIONAL VISITATION FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WITH WITH APPROPRIATE THAT DISTANCING- AND- AND YOU KNOW REQUIRE EXTENDED USE OF P. P. SO HE'D BE AVAILABLE- OF THE AD MASKING AND THEN OUTING AS A FOURTH WAR UP FOR A VISITORS AS WELL I THINK WE'RE RIGHT IN THIS RIGHT NOW I KNOW CITY. LOOK THIS IS. KING HELLO INSTALLATION FOR SENIORS DAHLE CROSS WELL BE STILL NAY FOR BIGELOW AT ENTER OF ICE THE OF THAT SENIORS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THAT HOME ON HOLD. OR A AND I EACH YES AS WELL AND YOU NEED CERTAINLY IS A I WHEN OFFICE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CORNET AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO- DEPUTY DIRECTOR STRANICA WHO ALSO HAS INPUT HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE FOR BRINGING UP- THE VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT- DISCUSSION AROUND VISITATION AS WE ALL KNOW I KNOW BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY- THE REALITIES OF THIS SINCE I TO HAVE LOST ONE OF MY LOVED ONES. IN A CONGREGATE SETTING TO KOBE THIS YEAR- AND- UNDER THE THAT UNABLE TO VISIT- POLICIES. AT CMS DID JUST RECENTLY SENT OUT A MEMO THAT- TWENTY DASH THIRTY TWO ALL OF THEIR FACILITIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT MOST OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CMS FIGHTS BEFORE. AND IN THAT IT OUTLINES SOME SAY CRACK BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING. IS THAT WHERE YOU CAN YOU FOR WHERE YOU HAVE AN UP TAKING CASES WHO ALSO TIME THE OBVIOUSLY THEN HOUSE MORE CASES. IN THOSE FACILITIES FROM A SYMPTOMATIC SPREAD WHETHER THAT BE A HEALTH CARE WORKER MAYBE THAT WOULD BE A FUTURE VISITOR ON AND SO- I AGREE- WITH MANY OF THE THINGS THAT. TONY CHECK A TOPLESS SHARED WITH ME WE'VE KIND OF HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS AND I THINK MORE TO HOW WE CREATIVELY. AT THIS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY FACILITIES- IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN OUTBREAK IF THEY HAVE METAL THE TESTING GUIDELINES OF PP. AND ALL OF THE GUIDELINES LISTED IN C. M. S.'S MEMO THEY ARE ABLE TO THEN RE OPENS FOR AND VISITATION IF THEY COME. FOLLOW ALL OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS- AND SO I THINK ASK ME SEE THAT MOST OF OUR AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH ONCE ALL OF OUR FACILITIES AND OTHER BASELINE TESTING- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY SPREAD AND IF THERE'S AN OUTBREAK VERSUS NOT AN OUTBREAK IN THEIR AREA- I. SEE PROBABLY MORE OF WHAT CRAIG- CORNET WAS DESCRIBING AS CREATIVE WAYS- THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HAVE FUN STATE. VISITATION WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH TESTING- WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH PHYSICAL DISTANCE SCENE IT'S IMPORTANT TO I KNOW A LOT OF STATESHAVE LOOKED AT NO OUT. OUT WERE SITTING. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT OF OUR SOME OF OUR- RESIDENTS NEED DISABILITY ARE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE FOR THEY DON'T- HAVE- YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO BE MOVED IN IN SUCH A WAY- IN SO I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF THINK CREATIVE LINE NOT AROUND. EQUITY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT- THAT ALL AS ARE DISABILITIES YOU KNOW OR- ARE KIND OF LOOKING AT THOSE THOSE WAYS. BECAUSE EVEN SOME OF OUR MORE URBAN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE- YOU KNOW SAFE PROPRIA OUTSOURCED BASIS EITHER- SO JUST TRYING TO THINK OF ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT COLOR. CITIES AS WE TRY TO. MAKE SURE. OUR STATE. AGAIN I KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM ARE FOR IN THIS GUIDELINES THE DIFFERENCE FORTH FAR I. THINK SENATOR KIRBY. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT A I THINK I WOULD HAVE ANY OTHER. FROM SENATORS I DO HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I MUST ASK IN THAT IS- AND WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE BUT I KNOW. BOTH AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TESTING STRATEGY ESPECIALLY FOCUSING ON AREAS LIKE RULE COMMUNITIES AND- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT I'M JUST INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW WE'RE CALLING ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO PRIORITIZE THESE COMMUNITIES- ESPECIALLY THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND THE TEST STRATEGY THAT WE'VE- PUT FORWARD AND ENSURING THAT THESE COMMUNITY- POOR DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED WITH HIGHER RATES- I KNOW THAT. CERTAINLY FROM REPRESENTING LA COUNTY BUT ALL OVER THE STATE WE'RE SEEING THIS HOW ARE WE CALLING MORE ATTENTION IS COMMITTEES. IN THE WAY WE ARE UP PROCEED FORWARD NOW. YES WILL START WITH A DOCTOR CONSENT HIKES HELTER. I THANK YOU CENTER REALLY GREAT QUESTION INEQUITIES THAT WE'VE OBSERVED AROUND OF IT NINETEEN INTERACTION REALLY EXTRAORDINARY AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEIR SEVERAL THINGS WERE DOING- IN LA COUNTY WELL DEPARTMENT I'M IN PUBLIC HEALTH IS FOCUSED ON THE OUTBREAKS AND CONTROL OF THE INFECTION. OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES IS OUR LEADER AND INDEED THANK TAP INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THIS ISSUE OF MAKING TESTING AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE SPREAD OF DISEASE AND COMMUNITY SOME PROTECT INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE IN CONCRETE OR OTHER FACILITIES HAS BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY. I KNOW YESTERDAY I WAS TALKING WITH THEIR LEAD PHYSICIAN AGAIN LOOKING HOW WE MIGHT HELP OR OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS MIGHT HELP TO EXPAND TESTING INTO THE STOP THESE COMMUNITIES THERE'S A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO FACE IT'S NOT JUST AS YOU KNOW MAKING THE FACILITY AVAILABLE FOR THE TESTING BUT THERE'S ALSO BUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF EDUCATION- MEDIA INFORMATION EXPROPRIATE BOTH LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY THE COMMUNITY SERVER ARE GETTING SO WE SEE THAT THERE'S A STRONG NEED TO INVOLVE OUR LEADERS IN THESE COMMUNITY AND. THIS IS OR GOING TO STATIONS IN I AND NAY NEEDS ADDITIONAL. THAT WE CAN HELP THEM. TO HELP US INTO THE SCREEN ACCURATE AND- THE PEOPLE DO WONDERS.
