HOUSE RESOLUTION FIFTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER PRIDE MONTH. THIS MODESTY ME OPEN. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE RESOLUTION FIFTY ONE. WHICH RECOGNISES JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER PRIDE MINE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW PRIDE WAS INSPIRED BY THE UPRISING AT THE STONEWALL INN IN JUNE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. WHICH SPARKED A LIBERATION MOVEMENT IN CELEBRATION OF LGBTQ PLUS CULTURE. THIS CALL TO ACTION CONTINUES TODAY AS WE TRY TO LIVE UP TO OUR NATION'S PROMISE OF EQUALITY LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. PRIDE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY ARE TRY AMPS ARE TRAILBLAZERS. WE HONOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUGHT BRAVELY AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR FULL EQUALITY. WHEN I THINK OF PRIDE I THINK ABOUT BEING THE FIRST OUT MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE. THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE BIRTH WHILE IN OFFICE RIGHT TO ME IS SHOWING THAT MY FAMILY OR LOVED OUR COMMUNITY IS VALID AND IS WORTHY OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DESIRE. AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT TWO WOMEN CANNOT HAVE CHILDREN YOU SHOW THEM THE TRUE POWER OF YOUR LOVE BY HAVING THREE BABIES AT ONCE. WELL INTENTIONED AND VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ FAMILIES THAT LOOK LIKE OURS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO CELEBRATE YOUR AROUND BUT EVEN MORE DURING PRIDE MONTH. TO THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR COMING OUT LOSING FAMILY LOSING FRIENDS FEELING THE PAIN THAT CAN COME WITH LIVING THEIR LIFE AUTHENTICALLY. KNOW THAT YOU ARE PRIDE. IN THE FIFTY TWO YEAR SINCE THE STONEWALL RIOTS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY HAS ACHIEVED REMARKABLE PROGRESS LANDMARK SUPREME COURT RULING THAT STRUCK DOWN DISCRIMINATORY LAWS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MARRIAGE EQUALITY BECAME THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND WE HAVE ESTABLISH WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE IN MANY STATES BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY STATE LEGISLATURES ARE WAGING ATTACKS ON LGBTQ RIGHTS PEOPLE STILL LACK FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTION TO HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS AND THEY ARE ON THE FACE. DROUGHT RISK FACING DISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC. DURING THE PANDEMIC LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS HAVE EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF POVERTY AND INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN OUR NATION CONTINUES TO WITNESS A TRAGIC SPIKE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDER WOMEN. WOMEN OF COLOR NO GENDER DIVERSE PEOPLE EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SOME LOCAL CITIES HAVE DISPUTED ON WHETHER TO FLY WIDE PRIDE A PRIDE FLAG DURING THIS MONTH. THESE ARE LOCAL CITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE A DUTY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST INTOLERANCE AND CONTINUE OUR ROLES AS LEADERS IN THE FIGHT FOR LGBTQ EQUALITY QUALITY. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST DAY IN THE US TO LEGALIZE DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SAME SEX COUPLES AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE US TO OFFICIALLY BANNED THE USE OF GAY PANIC AND TRANS GENDER PANIC DEFENSE AND MURDER TRIALS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO REQUIRE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO TEACH R. G. B. T. Q. HISTORY TODAY WE RISE TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY AND LEADERSHIP ON LGBTQ EQUALITY H. R. FIFTY ONE AFFIRMS PRIDE MONTH AS A CELEBRATION OF DIVERSITY DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF FULL EQUALITY. FOR LGBTQ FAMILIES LIKE MY OWN. AS WE FORMALLY RECOGNIZE PRIDE ON THE FLOOR TODAY THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE I'LL GIVE YOU TO KEEP CAUCUS HAVE PROVIDED EACH OF YOU. WITH PRIDEFUL MEMENTOS IN YOUR BAG INCLUDED. COLORLESS SKITTLES TO SIGNIFY ONLY ONE RAINBOW MATTERS THIS MONTH HELLO PAL PEN. A FIRE TO HONOR THIS YEAR'S PRIZE HONOREES WHO WILL BE CELEBRATING DAYS THIS WEEK AND EVERY DAY THIS MONTH FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MAY YOU FIND PRIDE TODAY AND ALWAYS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BUILT ON HOUSE RESOLUTION FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER MANTAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YOUR RECOGNIZING YOUR DESK. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND THE LET THE ANALYSTS AT THE CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR. FIFTY ONE. AT THE TIME OF CELEBRATION BUT ALSO A TIME TO REFLECT ON THE TRIAL OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AND THE WORK WE STILL HAVE A HEAD. FELL COMMITTEE QUEUE RIGHTS MOVING WOULD BE NOWHERE WITHOUT THE TIRELESS EFFORTS OF POWERFUL AND RESILIENT CORRECTIVE ISSUE FOUGHT AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT. FOR PEOPLE'S FREEDOMS TWO X. THIS. SOME OF THE CHAU BASE IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BRAVELY FOUGHT FOR FULLY QUALITY INCLUDE MARSHA P. JOHNSON A BLACK SELF IDENTIFIED DRAG QUEEN PROMINENT GAY LIBERATION ACTIVIST. AND VETERAN OF STALLONE RIOTS. STILL VERY VEDA I LET THE NOW IDENTIFIED SIMPLY AS CELIA INTER GENDER IDENTITY REMAIN FLUID THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. ANOTHER STONEWALL RIOTS VETERAN SHE AND MARCIA FOUND THE GROUP STAR STREET TRANSVESTITE ACTION REVOLUTIONARIES WHICH OFFERED HOUSING TO HOMELESS IN TENTS IN YOUR YOUTH IS PARTICULARLY WONDERFUL POPULATION. WE ALSO HAVE IS A MAJOR A BLACK TRANSGENDER WOMAN SAY THAT WHOSE HISTORY OF HOMELESSNESS AND INCARCERATION TURNED HER INTO ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE ORGANIZER'S. THE TRANS COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO. STORM THE LOVE VERY VERY EIGHT THEY J. A RACIAL LESBIAN OFFER ACTIVISM IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND FUNDRAISING FOR WOMEN SEPARATE THE MASSIVE BALANCE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WE'LL SAY WE'LL STUDY I LET THE AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST A LONG TIME TRACK FOR FORMER AND A VETERAN WHO SERVED IN GERMANY DURING WORLD WAR TWO. THREE BECAME THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PERSON TO RUN. FOR AGAME MEXICAN AMERICAN FILMMAKER ARTIST AND GAY RIGHTS AND HIV ACTIVIST THEN IS THE LEÃ³N A FORMER NEW YORK CIY HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER WHO IS ONE OF THE FIRST CITY OFFICIALS TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE WAS INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS. AND WHO LATER LED ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST INFLUENTIAL ADVOCACY GROUP FOR THAT THE ANALYST WITH AIDS. SALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WITNESSED A HORRIFIC SPIKE IN FATAL VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDER WOMAN OF COLOR AND UNDER. GENDER DIVERSE PEOPLE. SOCIAL IDENTITIES MATTER THEY'RE NOT INTANGIBLE CONCEPT THAT WE SHOULD SHY AWAY FROM AMPLICON REYES STATIONS. AS A SOCIETY WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF CREATING SPACES FOR PEOPLE TO BE FULLY EXPRESSIVE OF WITH THEY ARE. INTO A KNOWLEDGE SO MANY LAYERS THAT WE COMMON OUT THERE AND I INTERSECTION MALADIES. BEING THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AS A SINGLE HOMOGENEOUS COMMUNITY CAN BE DETRIMENTAL. NOT RECOGNIZING THAT ADVERSITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS THE VOICES OF LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION DUE TO INTERSECTION IDENTITIES. I THE WHOLE US POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE AN INCREASED RISK OF UNEMPLOYMENT HOMELESSNESS FOOD INSECURITY THERE IS ONLY ELEVATED FOR THE LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE PEOPLE WILL ALSO FACE REJECTION FROM FAMILIES AT HIGHER RATES AND HAVE LESS SUPPORT NETWORK ON WHICH THEY CAN RELY ON IT TENS OF HELD A FINANCIAL CRISIS. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ROLL BACK SEVERAL POLICIES PROTECTING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE AND IN HOMELESS SHELTERS WHICH MANY PEOPLE ARE. LIKELY TO NEED IN THE WAKE OF COVER NINETEEN. I MONTH THIS PLAN ONCE WE WILL CELEBRATE WILL ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN HONOR OF LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY BY UNITING OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS UNDER ONE INTERSECTIONAL UMBRELLA HELPING TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THESE MOVEMENTS. AND ALSO SHERRY STONER WITH A TALKING TO A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS. I'LL LET YOU KNOW GAYS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE TALK ABOUT OUR LATINO IDENTITIES WE DON'T ALWAYS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CREDIT ENTITY AT THE SCENE SPACE. AND HOW WE KEEP DISTINCT OR SEPARATE ONLY TALKED ABOUT HOW DO WE ARE SET TOGETHER BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT WE DON'T NEED THOSE IDENTITIES BEHIND WE WALK INTO THE INTO. A LATINO GROUP OR INTO A CAREER GROUP OUT THERE AND SO I JUST TALKED TO THE WORK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO OUT THERE AS WE- NAVIGATE THE SPACE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION. BOARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED LEADERS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PROUD TO RISE ON BEHALF OF OUR API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. PRIDE MONTH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IT'S A MONTH WHERE MY CITY BECOMES ALIVE. ACTUALLY EVEN LIVELIER THAN IT USUALLY IS IT'S A TIME WHEN WE CELEBRATE LOVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE YEAR. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE AT TIMES- IN OUR CITY OUR CITY HAS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AS PEOPLE HAVE COME AND GONE. WITHIN OUR CITIES COMMUNITY FABRIC. BEFORE OUR LGBT COMMUNITY THIS IS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE I THINK BACK TO THE TIME WHEN I WAS OUR COUNTY'S ASSESSOR RECORDER AND I NEVER THOUGHT THAT BEING THE PERSON WHO SIGNS MARRIAGE LICENSES WOULD EVER BE A CONTROVERSIAL THING EVER. IN POLITICS. BUT THERE WE WERE AS OUR COMMUNITY WAS TRY STRUGGLING TO FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND OUR CITY WAS SO PROUD TO REALLY BE AT THE FOREFRONT. OF THAT EFFORT TO FOCUS AND TO TALK ABOUT FAMILIES WANTED TO BECOME UNITED. AND I REMEMBER. I HAD THE HUGE HONOR OF MARYLAND ONE COUPLE WHEN. GAY MARRIAGE FIRST BECAME LEGAL AND IT WAS A CAUCASIAN MALE AN ASIAN AND ASIAN MALE WHO I MARRIED IN MY OFFICE. AND I REMEMBER HIS CHINESE MOTHER COMING UP TO ME AFTERWARDS. AND SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING OUR FAMILY HOLE. IT WASN'T THAT. THE MOM DID NOT THINK OF HER FAMILY'S WHOLE. IT WAS SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS HE WAS OUR PROBLEM THAT WE HAD ALWAYS MADE THIS AN ISSUE THEY HAVE LONG ACCEPTED THIS FAMILY AS PART OF THEIR FAMILY. BUT REMOVING THIS FINAL PART OF STIGMA REMOVING THIS LEGAL BARRIER SOMETHING THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HER THIS THIS OLDER IMMIGRANT CHINESE WOMAN. AND SO I THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER APR IS WHO ARE LGBTQ. AND THEIR STRUGGLE AS THEY HAD TO COME OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES AND HOW DO. DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I KNOW OUR COMMUNITY HAS REALLY. GROWN ON IT HAS REALLY EVOLVED ON I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE TOUGH FIGHTING- THE NONPROFIT CAMPAIGN AND TALKING ABOUT. HOW WE COULD MESSAGE THIS ISSUE IN OUR PARTICULAR API COMMUNE. IT TO ME IT ALWAYS CAME BACK TO THE FOCUS ON FAMILY. BECAUSE FAMILY IS SUCH A CENTRAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. AND FOR US THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO COME TOGETHER. BE ABLE TO LIVE TOGETHER AND TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHO THEY LOVE. TOGETHER AND ULTIMATELY WAS THE WINNING MESSAGE AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE OUR COMMUNITY HAS COME EVEN IN THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS. IT'S REALLY MIRRORS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT IN MANY WAYS IT MIRRORS THAT EXACT THOUGHT PROCESS ONCE THEY REALIZED. THAT THIS WAS ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR FAMILY ABOUT CHOICE FOR THEIR FAMILY IT IS ABOUT. LOVE LOVING THEIR FAMILY. ALL THE OTHER ISSUES DIDN'T SEEM VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO FOR THAT I RISE AND ASK ALL OF US TO SUPPORT HR FIFTY ONE THE TO CELEBRATE PRIDE MONTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR TANG. AS A MEMBER ARAMBULA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I COME FROM THE CITY OF FRESNO AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THE ZIP CODE THAT I COME FROM AS WELL NINE THREE SEVEN TWO EIGHT. IT IS IN THAT ZIP CODE THAT I GREW UP AND HAVE THE HONOR OF LIVING RIGHT NOW IN THE AREA OF FRESNO CALLED THE TOWER DISTRICT AN AREA THAT FOR DECADES HAS BEEN ACCEPTING WELCOMING AND LOVING TO OUR LGBT COMMUNITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND IT IS IN THAT TOWER DISTRICT THAT WE HAVE A THEATRE A THEATRE THAT HAS A REAL PRIDE FILM FESTIVAL EVERY YEAR DOCUMENTING AND SHOWING LGBTQ FILMS A FILM FESTIVAL THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WHO'S MARRIED TO MY SISTER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND IS A HIGHLIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT IT WAS JUST THIS YEAR IN THE CITY OF FRESNO THAT WE FOR THE FIRST TIME RAISED THE PRIDE FLAG IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO YOU MUST IMAGINE THE EXUBERANCE I HAPPEN TO ME SEE MY SISTER ON LAW OUT THERE GIVING A SPEECH TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT FOR HER IN OUR COMMUNITY TO SEE THAT FLAG RAISED IN FRESNO. AND YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE JOY THAT CAME OUT FROM SO MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT THE STRUGGLE IS REAL AS WELL BECAUSE THERE WAS A YOUNG CITY COUNCILWOMAN JUST SOUTH OF FRESNO IN A CITY CALLED KINGSBURG JUL HER TADO WHO TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING TO HAVE PRIDE CELEBRATED IN THAT CITY. AND SHE BROUGHT THIS UP AND WAS A TAPPED WHILE ON THE DYESS SHE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN HER ABILITY TO RAISE THE FLAG IN THAT CITY BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET THE STRUGGLE IS REAL FOR SO MANY TO SEEK THAT ACCEPTANCE THAT WE MUST HIGHLIGHT WHEN WE DO MAKE PROGRESS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO MAKE PLACES IN THE VALLEY. REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR GREAT STATE SO WHILE MANY OF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AS WELL TO BE ADVOCATING AND FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IN YOUR BACKYARD. AND YOUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. I THANK YOU AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR HR FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU DR ROBERT LEFT. SENATE AROMAS YOUR RECOGNIZING HER DESK.

WHICH IS A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THE REMARKABLE CULTURE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF LGBTQ PLUS CALIFORNIANS OF COURSE I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST VIBRANT LGBTQ COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND HISTORIC. PART OF THE MOVEMENT FOR LGBTQ RIGHTS PRIDE MONTH ALSO GIVES US A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LGBTQ JEWS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FABRIC OF THE CALIFORNIA'S OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE JEWISH COMMUNITY. THIS MONTH MANY SYNAGOGUES ACROSS THE STATE WILL CELEBRATE PRIDE MONTH BY HONORING LGBTQ COMMUNITY THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AT FRIDAY NIGHT SERVICES. AND WE'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY'S LEADERSHIP AND MANY PROMINENT JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS. INCLUDING RABBIS CANTORS AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF MAJOR INSTITUTIONS. AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE BETH HI AM HOW DOES SHE CAME RIGHT IN MY DISTRICT. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO AS THE WORLD'S FIRST SYNAGOGUE BY AND FOR GAY AND LESBIAN JEWS IN THE WORLD. WE ALSO TAKE SPECIAL PRIDE IN THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT LGBTQ JEWS HAVE MADE TO OUR STATE AND NATION IN SO MANY FIELDS INCLUDING ART LITERATURE SCIENCE BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA. WE APPLAUD LGBTQ JEWS WHO HAVE HELPED TO LEAD THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE REPUBLIC SERVICE BEGINNING WITH HARVEY MILK WHO BOLDLY PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHERS. OTHERS INCLUDING CONGRESSMAN FORMER CONGRESSMAN BARNEY FRANK COLORADO GOVERNOR JEROD PAULUS THE FIRST OPENLY TRANSGENDER MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE BARBARA KASPAR SUPERSPEED AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. BUT COLLEAGUES WE ALSO SOLEMNLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MARK THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASSACRE THIS JUNE. THE DEADLIEST ATTACK ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS STILL MUCH MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO ADVANCE THE RIGHTS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WHILE THE SHOOTER AT THE PULSE MAY NOT HAVE SPECIFICALLY BEEN TARGETING. THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THE ATTACK WAS MOTIVATED BY HATE AND VENGEANCE AND THE COMMUNITY BECAME THE VICTIM AS IS. TOO FAR OFF IN THE CASE. TWENTY TWENTY WAS RECORDED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN AS THE MOST VIOLENT YEAR AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE. SINCE THEY BEGAN TRACKING SUCH HATE CRIMES WITH FORTY FOUR FATALITIES RECORDED. HRC IS ALSO COUNTED OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR ALONE TO CURB THE RIGHTS OF THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAPD HAS REPORTED A 66% INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES OVERALL AND A 26% INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ENSURE EQUALITY FOR EVERYONE AND THAT NO ONE FEARS FOR THEIR SAFETY OR THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO BE DONE BUT THERE'S HOPE AND THE JEWISH CAUCUS WILL STAND STRONG AND PROUD WITH THE L. G. B. T. Q. KAKAK CAUCUS AS WE KEEP FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY. AND WHAT'S RIGHT. AND FINALLY HERE'S HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL ATTEND PRIDE PARADES NEXT YEAR. AND CELEBRATE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND SUITABLE FASHION BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT JUSTICE ON ZOOM. AND SO ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. DECEMBER WEBER YOU'RE RECOGNIZING YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR FIFTY ONE. PRIDE MONTH IS A TIME WHEN WE COME TOGETHER TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS A TIME FOR THE CONTINUOUS FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL. I STAND PROUD SUPPORT OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ONGOING STRUGGLE AGAINST ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION OR INJUSTICE. LAST THURSDAY OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE LGBTQ EQUALITY SPACE HAVE OCCURRED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE WORK OF BLACK LGBTQ ACTIVIST. THERE IS A LONG LIST OF BLACK LGBTQ LEADERS WHO STOOD AND CONTINUE TO STAND AT THE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS. MANY OF THEIR NAMES HAVE BEEN STATED ON THIS FLOOR. BUT OTHERS HAVE NOT SUCH AS BAYNARD RUSTIN. BILL WILSON LAVERNE **** ANDREA JENKINS LORI LIGHTFOOT AND OFF FUNDS- DAVID TO NAME A FEW. OVER THE YEARS THESE EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVISTS FROM THE BLACK LGBTQ COMMUNITY HAVE MOVED US WITH THEIR TALENT COURAGE STRENGTH AND LEADERSHIP. FROM ADVOCATING pICONIC BLACK ART THE BLACK LGBTQ COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO LEAD IN THE SPACE OF RADICAL CHANGE AND POLITICS. BUT DESPITE THESE AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE LEADERS AND THE LGBTQ MOVEMENT. BAR TO MANY MEMBERS OF THE BLACK LGBTQ COMMUNITY REMAIN MARGINALIZED AND FACE DISPROPORTIONATE DISCRIMINATION VIOLENCE AND OTHER FORMS OF PERSECUTION BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND WHO THEY CHOOSE TO LIVE. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HIGHER RATES OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY AND BLACK LGBTQ YOUTH AND ADULTS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY OVER FORTY FOUR TRANSGENDER OR GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE WERE FATALLY SHOT OR KILLED BY VIOLENT MEANS. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE BLACK OR LATIN ACTS. SO AS WE CELEBRATE AND REFLECT ON THE HISTORIC CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I URGE YOU TO ALSO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MULTIPLE INTERSECTING STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES FACED BY BLACK LGBTQ COMMUNITY DUE TO THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND RACIAL IDENTITY. WE MUST ALL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THE ADVANCEMENT OF EQUALITY FOR ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO STILL STRUGGLE TO ATTAIN THE BASIC RIGHTS THAT ALL SHOULD BE AFFORDED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR FIFTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER AS A MEMBER JONES SAWYER YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR DESK THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OR HR FIFTY ONE. I MONTH IS A SPECIAL TIME FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. A TIME OF HIGHLIGHTING AND CELEBRATING LAW. I RECOGNIZE IN OUR COUNTLESS BROTHERS SISTERS AND SIBLINGS ARE OFTEN CAST INTO DEBATES ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD BE. VERSUS WHO THEY ARE. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW. SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW. REGINALD BYRON JONES SAWYER JUNIOR IS GAY. THAT'S MY SON. AND AS HIS FATHER I HAD THE DISTINCT HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF OFFICIATING MY OWN SON'S MARRIAGE TO IS NOW HUSBAND IN A MOVING CEREMONY FILLED WITH UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND SUPPORT. WHEN MY SON CAME OUT TO ME. HE THOUGHT I WOULD BE ANGRY. AND TO THIS DAY I'M ANGRY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID. TO GIVE HIM THAT IN SECURITY THAT HE COULDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THE MOST INTIMATE THING ABOUT HIM. THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED. AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE STILL HAVE A LONG LONG WAY TO GO. BEFORE MARRIAGE EQUALITY WAS ACHIEVED THE ONLY OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY SON WAS SUB STANDARD DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS THESE PARTNERSHIPS FOR CITED AS QUOTE UNQUOTE MIDDLE GROUND THE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. OPTION FOR SAME SEX COUPLES THE SAME RHETORIC THEY USED TO KEEP SEGREGATED SCHOOLS IN PLACE. COMPROMISES BOTH SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT BE MADE FOR INDIVIDUALS BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. REALLY THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND. HONORING THE LGBTQ PRIDE MOVEMENT WE MUST ALWAYS PAY TRIBUTE TO THOSE BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO IGNITED THE MOVEMENT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IT WAS SPEARHEADED BY CLEAR PEOPLE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS. THROUGHOUT THE MOVEMENT CLEAR BLACK ORGANIZED HAVE STOOD FIRM IN THEIR INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES AS THEY HAVE LED TO SEEK TRUE EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND AS THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES IN HIS PERSEVERANCE STILL TO THIS DAY WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT QUEER BLACK INDIVIDUALS HAVE LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED. AND EVEN THE RACE FROM THE NARRATIVE WHEN DISCUSSING THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE FURTHER DURING A PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED DISCRIMINATION AND ABUSES AGAINST AYE TRANSGENDERS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF COLOR IS EVIDENT THAT THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE. WE MUST HAVE AN EQUIVOCAL. BUT WE MUST UNEQUIVOCALLY AFFIRMED THE TRANSGENDER LIVES MATTER BLACK TRANS LIVES MATTER AS WE CONTINUE FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST HATE AND ABUSE AGAINST THE L. G. B. T. Q. COMMUNITY YOU MUST ALL UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF THE STRUGGLE. I NOT IT THOSE WHO WERE AT THE FOREFRONT OF AFFECTING POSITIVE CHANGE. DURING MY COLLEAGUES OF THE L. G. B. T. Q. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO CELEBRATE LOVE AND ONE'S IDENTITY WE MUST RECOGNIZE EARNS ARE INSEPARABLE INTERSECTION MALADY AND CONTINUE TO WORK IN UNION AS WE SEEK TO PROMOTE TRUE EQUALITY. AND JUSTICE. END TO END. AS A PROUD FATHER OF A GAY MAN THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR UNANIMOUS UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR HR. FIFTY ONE. NAME IS A JONES SAWYER. SEVERALLY YOU'RE RECOGNIZING YOUR DESK. THANK YOU AS A SPEAKER HAPPY PRIDE MONTH MEMBERS I'M VERY HONORED TO BE JOINING YOU ON CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL WHERE OF COURSE THE ONLY PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DECADES AGO THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMAGINABLE THE PROGRESS REMAINS A SOCIETY TO TAKE DECADES AGO WOULD NOT BEEN IMAGINABLE I DO WANT ALSO THANK MY MANY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE STATE THAT REMINDED US THAT BEING LGBTQ PLUS PART THE COMMUNITY IS BY DEFINITION. INTERSECTIONAL EVERY MEMBER OF THOSE UV PLUS COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY HAS A RACE AGE GENDER RELIGION AND WE UNDERSTAND THE SITTING AT THIS CROSSROADS OF INTERSECTION HOW IMPORTANT IS TO BE UP LIFTING THE COMMUNITIES OF CONSOLATION RUBBLE FROM OPPRESSION IN THIS COUNTRY WHETHER. IT BE YOUR ETHNIC GROUP OR RELIGIOUS GROUP THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REMINDS ME OF AMONG OUR FANTASTIC TEN HONOREES ARE HONORING TODAY I HAVE TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO KIM TRAN WHO I'VE HONORED WHO IS FROM MY HOMETOWN OF SAN JOSE WHO HAS FOR OVER A DECADE. FOCUS ON HER WORK IN FACILITATING ANTI OPPRESSION TRANS INCLUSION AND OPERATING ANTI BLACK THE STRINGS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF AUDIENCES INCLUDING THE U. S. CONSULATE AND IS ALSO INSTRUCTIVE INFORMED LGBT LGBTQ YOUTH SPACE IN SAN JOSE WHICH IS A THERAPEUTIC SAY SPACE A QUEER YOUTH IN THE SOUTH BAY. AND I HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE I THINK SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY RUDE ESPECIALLY TODAY AND ACTIVISM OF QUERY ACTIVISTS IS THAT WITHOUT HAVING TOTAL LIBERATION FOR ALL PEOPLE AND IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD ACTUALLY WE CANNOT HAVE QUEER LIBERATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE KANTANA FRONT LINES FIGHTING WITH EVERY SINGLE OTHER GROUP. AND SOMETHING THAT REMINDS ME IS THAT HOW IMPORTANT THE POWER PRESENTATION REALLY IS I THINK ABOUT IN THE LGBT CAUCUS RIGHT NOW SENATOR LAYERED WAS ONE THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MAYOR IS IN ALL OF THE COUNTRY I BELIEVE AND HOW THAT PROGRESSES PERCOLATE UP TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN STAND HERE DO YOU AS WELL THE YOUNGEST EMBERS ALSO THE FIRST BISEXUAL SAY LEGISLATOR- IT IS AN HONOR AND A RESPONSIBILITY I DO NOT THINK I WAS I CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE AND I WAS LIKE I THOUGHT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMEONE ELSE THAT WAS OPENLY BISEXUAL FOR ME. BUT IN CONVERSATIONS OF MY COMMUNITY. I'M REMINDED THAT THE L. G. B. HE PLUS COMMITTEE I TOLD YOU PLUS. LGB APPLE PLUS ACRONYM THEY MUST BE ABLE AKRAM IS ACTION THE PLUS. PLUS INDICATING THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND ADDING MORE WELCOMING TO ALL THE IDENTITIES ARE OUT THERE AND AS A BISEXUAL THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY I'M MORE TECHNICALLY AND WERE OFFICIALLY WOULD BE PANSEXUAL IS I'D REJECT THE BINARY OF THE GENDER. OF IS. WE HAVE TO REMIND WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY REMINDED THAT WE ARE IN THE LGBT COMMIT LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY IS NOT SIMPLY AS SOMETIMES WE STILL HEAR RHETORIC TODAY OF SIMPLY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BEDROOM THAT IS THE MOST OFFENSIVE AND REDUCTIVE BOILING DOWN OF IDENTITY. IS ABOUT HOW EXPRESS. OUR LOVE OUR IDENTITY AND WHO AND HOW WHICH IS OVER LIVE OUR LIVES AND FOR THE FOLKS OUT THERE. WHO ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THIS COUNTRY WHO CONSTANTLY HAVE TO LIVE EVERY DAY WITH BEING MISGENDERED DEAD NAMES. OR ANY OTHER SORT OF MICRO MACRO AGGRESSION OUT THERE THAT EXISTS. WE ARE HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU WE'RE HERE TO UPLIFT TO INCLUDE YOU IN THIS COMING KANSEI BEER THE FIGHT I REMEMBER EVEN. YES ONLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MEMBERS HAVE ASKING FOR LIKE WHEN DID I COME OUT IS I THINK REALLY NEVER HAD A COMING OUT THE I JUST KIND OF EXISTED IN THAT KIND OF ROME I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BECOME MORE OF A TREND AND MORE OF THE MORE OF THE- WAY THINGS ARE DONE IN IN THE FUTURE. I BELIEVE I READ THAT ONE IN SIX CHEN ZEROS ARE ACTUALLY LGBT COSTS IDENTIFYING ALREADY I THINK THAT NUMBER WILL ONLY GROW GROW MORE. I JUST REMEMBER AND I THINK THIS IS THE FEELING THAT MOST LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE NOW IS. THE MOMENT YOU KNOW THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG WE DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG BASED ON THE NORMS OF THE DAY IS WHEN YOU START HAVING THAT SENSE OF IN CLING THAT'S- YOU PERHAPS DON'T FIT THE HETERONORMATIVE STEREOTYPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I REMEMBER MY FIRST- PARTNER THE TIME CALL ME HETERO FLEXIBLE. IF I WAS WITH. A WOMAN AT THE TIME SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING SO EVEN OTHER PEOPLE TO TELL OF AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING TIMES WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT WAS AND ALSO IT'S GREAT I WAS AND THERE WAS A PROP EIGHT DAYS AND THAT JUST PASSED AND THAT WAS REALLY FORMING. THE IDENTITY OF WHEN YOU KNOW OUR OUR STATE HAD JUST HAD A REFERENDUM SAYING IS GAMERS OKAY OR NOT AND IN HINDSIGHT YOU THINK ABOUT TO GET THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW I THINK THE GREAT STRIDES MADE EDUCATION AS I REMEMBER USED TO BE- ALMOST FASHIONABLE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE IS GAY. I THINKING BACK ON IT LIKE YOU KNOW DECADES OF FOUR I THINK THAT'S SUCH A CRAZY TIME SUCH AN ARTIFACT OF THAT TIME BUT HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. I KNOW I'M RAMBLING A LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY EXPRESS THEMSELVES SO THEY'RE DIFFERENTLY AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RESPECT THAT HOW THEY EXPRESS THEIR GENDER ACCESS TO HOW THEY LOVE. AND ESPECIALLY HAS A BISEXUAL MEMBER YOU KNOW I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT. DO I BELONG EVEN TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY BECAUSE IF I DID A WOMAN THE PEOPLE THINK I'M STRAIGHT IF I DID A MAN THAT IF PEOPLE THINK I'M GAY AND THAT IS SOMETHING I'VE HEARD FROM SO MUCH OF THE COMMUNITY THAT. THEY FEEL THEY DON'T BELONG TO EITHER COMMITTEE AND AS I CAME OUT OPENLY WELL AS A LEGISLATOR I HAVE HEARD SO MANY MEMBERS OF MY CAN YOU SAY I'M FLAT AND BRADLEY OF REPRESENTATION THE STATE I'M GLAD. TO BE LEVEL LIVE AUTHENTICALLY AS BY SOCIAL SIX. L. AS A BISEXUAL MEMBER COMMUNITY. SO HAPPY SO. PRIVATE YOU. AND THANK SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. DECEMBER WELL YOUR YOUR DESK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER IN COLLEAGUES MY PRONOUNS ARE HE HIM AND HIS AND I PROUDLY STAND AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS ROOM IT JUST BEAMING WITH PRIDE. ING WITH DIVERSITY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CELEBRATE BUT WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER OUR HISTORY. AND AS A LEGISLATIVE STAFFER AND AS A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY FOR IT NOW FIFTEEN YEARS. AND MY FIRST YEAR WORKING IN THIS LEGISLATIVE FAMILY THERE WAS A TIME IN WHICH PRIDE WAS CELEBRATED ON THIS VERY FLOOR. IN WHICH MEMBERS OF ON THE OTHER CROSS OF THE AISLE WOULD ALL STORM GET UP AND WALK OFF THE FLOOR. SO TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE I THINK YOU WERE IN THIS ROOM. FOR GIVING US THE DIGNITY TO RECOGNIZE PRIDE. AT THE SAME TIME IMAGINE. THAT YES WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. BUT THERE'S STILL A GUT PUNCH THAT STILL OCCURS REGULARLY EACH AND EVERY YEAR. A BLOOD DRIVE WE OF COURSE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF HOSTING A BLOOD DRIVE TO HELP SAVE LIVES. IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF. AND SO MANY OTHERS. IN OUR COMMUNITY M. WHICH BECAUSE THERE IS A- BAN ON GAY MEN DONATING BLOOD SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. BUT THAT FEELS LIKE TO BE REMINDED THAT. WE ARE NO GOOD. THAT YES WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES SACRIFICE OF OURSELVES BUT. NOT YOUR BLOOD THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU. COLLEAGUES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS IN THIS BUILDING WHO ARE NOT OUT. AND IT'S AN INCUMBENT UPON US ALL ALSO TO MAKE INCLUSIVE AND WORKPLACE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO FEEL SAFE. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REFLECT THE REPRESENT. NOT ONLY IS THE STATE CAPITAL BUT CALIFORNIA. THAT WHERE PLACE OF INCLUSION NOT EXCLUSION. COLLEAGUES THERE ARE CURRENTLY EXIST OVERALL A HUNDRED PIECES OF PENDING LEGISLATION IN THE COUNTRY AND MULTIPLE STATE ATTACKING MEMBERS OF ELDER COMMUNITY WHY. ANTI TRANS LEGISLATION TO PREVENT KIDS FROM BEING KIDS FROM ALLOWING AND PREVENTING I SHOULD SAY FROM PREVENTING INDIVIDUALS FOR BEING WHO THEY ARE TO BE AUTHENTIC. LET'S JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND PUT YOUR SELF IN THE MINDSET OF A YOUNG TRANS PERSON. AND THE DIFFICULTY ALREADY AS IT IS TO FIND A PLACE OF ACCEPTANCE. AND THAT'S WHY WE CELEBRATE PRIDE AND WE ALSO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT. TO HELPING CREATE A WORKPLACE A SOCIETY THAT IS EQUITABLE. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT EMPTY RHETORIC AND ABOUT A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL. NASCO BUT WHEN WE TAKE OFF THAT MASK YOU WILL LOOK IN. INSIDE THAT WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S MUCH PAIN. SO LET US BE A GREAT EXAMPLE NOT JUST FOR THE NATION BUT FOR THE WORLD AND SAYING THAT YOU BELONG AND WE LOVE YOU TOO. TRULY YOU BELONG. AND ASK YOU TO SEEK OUT IN THIS MOMENT. SOMEONE ELSE WHO PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOT BE AS ACCEPTING OR LOVING OR BABY JUST NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY BUT SEEK THEM OUT AND HAVE DIALOGUE AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO.
