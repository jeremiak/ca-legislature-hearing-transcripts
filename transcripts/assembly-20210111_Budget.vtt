THE SLIDES- MOVING ON THE FLY

WE HAVE OUR FORECAST HUNDRED

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:51.175
FIFTY BILLION THIS IS UP TO

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:51.809
NINE BILLION THE FROM THE

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TWENTY

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:57.514
TWENTY. AND- THAT'S 22% SURE

SUBAHDAR GREAT OKAY.

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.454
CALIFORNIA'S GDP TOOK A BIG

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.357
HEAD IN QUARTER TO- A THIRTY

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.926
ONE POINT 5% DROP. HOWEVER BY

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.995
QUARTER THREE THE GDP WAS GOING

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.963
BACK UP AND IT WAS BACK UP TO

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.032
TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.201
UNEMPLOYMENT HAD PEAKED AT

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.335
SIXTEEN POINT 4% BACK IN APRIL

AND MAY. AND IS NOW BACK IS NOW

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:23.107
DOWN TO EIGHT POINT 2% NOW ALL

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:25.609
THAT'S HAVE. THREE POINT 9% WAS

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:26.977
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PRIOR TO

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:31.181
THE RECESSION- ADDITIONALLY I

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.449
WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.084
THAT THERE ARE FOUR MILLION

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.819
CALIFORNIANS STILL RECEIVING

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:39.223
YOUR BENEFITS- AND THEY'RE LESS

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.090
THAN HALF OF THE JOBS THAT WERE

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:43.260
LOST AS OF FEBRUARY OF LAST

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:46.897
YEAR HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. CHECK

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:51.101
FLIGHT. SO THE OTHER THE GROWTH

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.603
HERE REALLY JUST DISPLAYS A

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.805
SIGNIFICANT STEP THAT HAPPENED

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.408
IN GDP- THIS WAS EXPERIENCE NOT

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.476
JUST IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU CAN

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:02.246
SEE BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:06.617
THEN. THE MOVE TO RECOVERY. SO

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:07.718
THE OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:10.120
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ROPOSES

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:10.621
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.022
BILLION IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.390
THAT'S A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:15.893
BILLION GENERAL FUND. I'M SURE

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.227
THE BUDGET MAINTAINS RESILIENCY

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.930
AND BUILD A STRONG REVENUE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.666
ATARI STRONG RESERVE OF TWENTY

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:23.634
TWO BILLION. WE HAVE A ONE TIME

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.803
SURPLUS AT FIFTEEN BILLION. AND

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.604
WE ALSO PROPOSE PAYING DOWN ON

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:28.939
ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.040
LIABILITIES THREE BILLION IN

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:32.276
THE BUDGET YEAR AND SIX POINT

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:32.810
FIVE BILLION OVER THE NEXT

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:35.412
THREE YEARS. WE ALSO DUE TO THE

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:38.015
IMPROVED REVENUE. ARE PROPOSING

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:38.615
THAT SCHEDULE PROGRAM

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.351
SUSPENSIONS BE DELAYED BY A

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:48.258
YEAR. SO MOVING ON TO THE NEXT

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.260
SLIDE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT-

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.096
CHARGING MENTIONED EARLIER THE

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:53.964
IMPROVE REVENUE PICTURE IS

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.666
LARGELY DUE TO THREE FACTORS

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.468
THE FIRST BEING THAT THE-

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:58.635
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WASN'T AS

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.504
SEVERE AS WAS IT AS AS WAS

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:03.907
EXPECTED. AND THIS IS LARGELY

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.110
DUE TO THE FEDERAL. SALARS THAT

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.277
WERE PROVIDED EARLY ON IN THE

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.513
SPRING OF LAST YEAR. HOWEVER

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.181
THERE THAT THE SECOND ONE IS

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.816
PERHAPS THE MOST SURPRISING AN

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.585
EQUAL SPREAD OF WAGE LOSS THIS

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.887
IS SIGNIFICANT- WE HAD A LOT OF

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.989
HIGHWAYS WORKERS THAT WERE ABLE

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:19.823
TO HAVE IT AND MOVED TO

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.092
TELEWORK AND- OTHER JOBS. BUT

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:25.029
WE HAD A LOT OF LOW WAGE

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:25.629
WORKERS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO DO

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:29.366
THAT. I'M THE HIGHWAY TO WORK.

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:30.434
TEND TO PAY MORE INTO. AND SO

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:31.402
THAT REALLY BUFFERED THE

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:34.004
REVENUE LOSS. TO THE STATE. AND

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.873
THEIR EARLY WE HAD. A RECORD

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:38.976
HIGH STOCK MARKET- PERFORMANCE.

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:40.310
AND THAT LED TO INCREASES IN

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.179
CAPITAL GAINS. THE DIFFERENT

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.313
POINTS TO DRAW FROM THIS IS

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.082
THAT THE IMPROVER REVENUE

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:47.384
RECESSION. VERY IMPROVED

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:48.786
REVENUE. YOU'RE REALLY

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:49.953
UNDERSCORES THAT THERE ARE TWO

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.022
STORIES GOING ON HERE.

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:54.591
BASICALLY IT AT OF TWO CONNOR-

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.293
AND THE BUDGET THAT BUDGET

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.228
REALLY WORK TO- PRO.

00:44:58.295 --> 00:45:00.697
INVESTMENTS TO HELP THE MOST

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.266
IMPACTED. SO WHILE THE

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.434
FORECASTING REVENUES IN THE

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.202
BUDGET HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.470
OPERATING DEFICITS IN THE OUT

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:07.738
YEARS YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:10.474
AND- ON. PAGE SIX. YOU CAN SEE

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:14.711
I'M THE REVENUE SURPLUS IN

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:15.913
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO-

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:17.614
IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.349
OPERATING DEFICIT IN THE OUT

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.918
YEARS STARTING AT SEVEN POINT

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.853
SIX BILLION IN TWENTY TWO

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.420
TWENTY THREE AND GROWING TO

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:25.622
OVER ELEVEN BILLION BY TWENTY

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.591
FOUR TWENTY FIVE. SO ONE THING

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:30.527
I WANNA POINT OUT HERE IS-

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:31.628
BEGAN LIMIT IS CURRENTLY

ABLE TO GIVE SOMETHING TO MOST.

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.867

ADDING MORE MONEY TO THE BUDGET

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.162

ALL CHILDREN WE'VE ALREADY BEEN

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:04.995
HEARING THAT TWO BILLION ISN'T

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.797
ENOUGH. WHAT IS THE RIGHT

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.732
NUMBER IS IT FOR BILLION IS IT

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.801
THREE BILLION. WE'VE GOT TO BE

GET THE JOB DONE AND NOT ENOUGH

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:16.640
JUST TO KIND OF KEEP THINGS

WITH THAT. I NOTICED THAT. AND

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:33.924
I'LL PREFACE THIS BY SAYING. I

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.127
THINK MY BAR MENTAL RECORD IS.

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.695

ABLE TO HELP US TO KNOW WHAT IS

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:29.679
ENOUGH. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.648
WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:32.282

AND THAT'S AVAILABLE- THAT WAS

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:12.215
RELEASED LAST NIGHT. OKAY O.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.250
MOVING TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:18.788
OUT- WE CALCULATED THAT THE

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:19.990
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:22.425
REFLECTS A FIFTEEN AND A HALF

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.427
BILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:31.801
REVENUE- URGE. THIS SURPLUS IS

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:34.738
LOWER NOTICEABLY LOWER THAN THE

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:35.739
TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.841
WINDFALL WE REFER TO- WE

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:39.442
ESTIMATED IN OUR NOVEMBER

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:42.278
FISCAL OUTLOOK. WE DESCRIBED IT

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:44.447
AS A WINDFALL BECAUSE WE

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:45.849
THOUGHT THAT HELPED EMPHASIZE

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:49.085
THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THIS- A

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:52.322
SURPLUS AND ALSO BECAUSE IT

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:54.057
REALLY IS THE RESULT OF THE

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.558
FACT THAT REVENUES DIDN'T

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.795
PLUNGE IN THE WAY THAT THE

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.330
BUDGET ACT ASSUME SO MUCH. ALL

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:01.431
RIGHT SO MUCH AS THEY HELD

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:02.465
CONSTANT AND FOLLOWED THE

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.634
HISTORIC TREND. THEY DIDN'T

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.437
ACTUALLY KNOW SURGE HIGHER THAN

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:12.575
THE HISTORIC. IN WITH THAT SAID

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:13.610
THE REVENUES FROM THE

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:15.078
ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.646
FINANCE AND OUR NUMBERS ARE

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:19.115
VERY SIMILAR OVER THE THREE

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.618
YEAR BUDGET WINDOW WE HAVE A

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.219
DIFFERENCE OF ONLY ONE POINT

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.354
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IN

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.756
THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE BUDGET

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:27.390
IS QUITE SMALL FOR A THREE YEAR

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:32.462
PERIOD. GIVEN THAT THE REVENUES

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:35.398
ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR YOU MAY.

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.267
WONDER HOW COULD OUR- ESTIMATE

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.803
OF THE SURPLUS BE SO DIFFERENT.

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.671
AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:44.240
REASONS FOR THAT. THE FIRST IS

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:45.875
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.544
HAS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.279
OF THE RULES GOVERNING WHEN A

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:52.282
DEPOSIT OR A TRUE UP DEPOSIT TO

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:54.017
THE STATE'S. RAINY DAY FUND AND

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.819
DEBT REPAYMENT PROVISIONS OF

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:59.823
PROPOSITION TWO IS REQUIRED.

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.858
UNDER THEIR INTERPRETATION FIVE

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:03.193
POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS COMES

00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:04.928
OUT OF THE SURPLUS FOR THAT

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:07.597
PURPOSE. AND IT'S NOT THE WAY

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.932
WE INTERPRET IT ALTHOUGH WE

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.334
THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:11.901
INTERPRETATION IS CERTAINLY

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:14.304
REASONABLE. SECOND THE

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.806
ADMINISTRATION HAS A TWO POINT

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:19.242
EIGHT BILLION IN HIGHER-

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:22.245
CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE EXPENSES

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:25.415
THAN WE HAVE. IN OUR- IN OUR

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:28.084
FISCAL OUTLOOK. AND THEN THIRD

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:30.553
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- TRENDS IN

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.222
EXPENDITURES FOR THE STATE'S

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:33.490
MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:35.391
PROGRAMS BASICALLY THE CASELOAD

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:37.260
DRIVEN PROGRAMS. THE

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.661
ADMINISTRATION IS ABOUT TWO

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:42.465
BILLION HIGHER THAN OUR OFFICES.

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.701
SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN. DRIVERS

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.970
OF THE DIFFERENCE THE FIGURE AT

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:48.872
THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE SHOWS

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:51.341
HOW WE SEE THE GOVERNOR

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:54.310
ALLOCATING THE WINDFALL. THE

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:57.981
DARK BARS ARE- BASICALLY THE

00:56:58.047 --> 00:56:59.282
ALLOCATIONS TO ONE TIME

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:00.850
SPENDIG AND I CAN TELL YOU

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:03.686
THAT THOSE SOME TO- EIGHT POINT

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.121
ONE BILLION SO THEY MAKE UP A

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:07.590
LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:11.427
TOTAL- SURPLUS OR WINDFALL- HE

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.496
HAS ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:14.397
BILLION WHICH THIS IS NOT

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:15.665
SHOWING ON YOUR SIDE BUT I

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:16.900
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.268
HERE'S ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.303
BILLION GOING INTO THE STATE-

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.304
DISCRETIONARY RESERVE THE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.072
SPECIAL PLAN FOR ECONOMIC

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.642
UNCERTAINTY. TWO POINT FIVE

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.010
BILLION OF THE WINDFALL IS USED

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:30.013
FOR. REVENUE REDUCTIONS

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:31.281
ESSENTIALLY THE BOOK OF THAT IS

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:33.783
THE- TAX REFUNDS THAT WOULD GO

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.351
TO LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS IN

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:37.921
CALIFORNIA. MANY HAS ONE POINT

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.523
THREE BILLION FOR. ONGOING

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.926
SPENDING. AND ABOUT SEVEN

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.861
HUNDRED MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.496
DEBT AND LIABILITY PAYMENTS.

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:49.966
ABOVE WATER REQUIRED. IN THE

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:53.736
EXISTING LAW. OKAY SO THEN

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:56.105
MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE I'LL

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.540
TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSITION

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.107
NINETY EIGHT- PORTION OF THE

00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.910
BUDGET. AND HERE DUE TO A

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:03.012
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:05.248
MINIMUM GUARANTEE THROUGH

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.150
ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW SO

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.751
FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:13.223
TWENTY. THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.557
ONE TWENTY TWO. THIS INCREASE

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.426
IS SUCH THAT THE STATE HAS

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:17.894
NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.096
AVAILABLE FOR NEW SPENDING ON

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:22.966
K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. THE WAY

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:23.533
THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.903
THIS. IS HE WOULD ALLOCATE

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.438
EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION IN ONE

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:29.839
TIME SPENDING TO PAY DOWN

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:35.178
BALLOT. AND ONCE THAT IS DONE

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.446
THERE WOULD THERE WOULD STILL

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:37.847
BE ABOUT FOUR BILLION AND

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.682
DEFERRALS LEFT ON THE BOOKS

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.951
AND- THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.720
70% OF THE DIFFERENT OF THE

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:44.888
DEFERRALS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:47.357
THE JUNE- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:50.059
PLAN. THEN IN ADDITION THE

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:55.231
GOVERNOR IS REQUESTING- THE SIX

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.666
POINT SIX BILLION IN ONE TIME

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.735
GRANT FUNDING FOR FOUR SCHOOL

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:01.070
DISTRICTS TWO BILLION OF THIS

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.039
WOULD BE FOR THE INCENTIVE.

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:06.276
FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO RESUME

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.611
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND THEN

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.114
FOUR POINT SIX BILLION WOULD BE

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.749
FOR GRANTS TO PROVIDE AN

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:15.118
EXPANDED ACADEMIC- PROGRAM

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.853
PARTICULARLY GEARED FOR THE

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.721
DISADVANTAGED OR HIGHER NEED

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:21.090
STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THEN

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.425
LAST THERE'S- TWO POINT TWO

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.661
BILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING.

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.196
THIS WOULD COVER THE COST OF

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:29.699
LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE LOCAL

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.935
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.337
OVERALL WE WOULD SAY THAT THIS

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:37.206
PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE IS.

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:38.741
REALLY REFLECTS A REASONABLE

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:41.044
MIX OF ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.880
SPENDING. YOU WOULD NOTE THAT

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:44.948
WITH THE EIGHT POINT FOUR

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:46.049
BILLION AND SIX POINT SIX

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.517
BILLION GOING TOWARD ONE TIME

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:48.952
PURPOSES IT'S A PRETTY

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.054
SIGNIFICANT- EMPHASIS ON ONE

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.622
TIME WHICH WE THINK IS

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.324
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE- THAT

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.326
PROVIDES A CUSHION FOR THE PROP

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:57.527
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET GOING

00:59:57.593 --> 00:59:58.928
FORWARD IN THE EVENT THERE IS.

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.463
VOLATILITY IN THE MINIMUM

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.933
GUARANTEE- ANY FUTURE

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.002
REDUCTIONS. WOULD BE LESS

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.470
LIKELY TO IMPACT SCHOOL

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.473
PROGRAMS. IF THEY'RE NOT BILL

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:10.974
TEN THROUGH NEW ONGOING

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.010

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:18.081
SHIFTING TO PAGE THREE. ALL I

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:19.048
JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.450
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.085
DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:24.153
OF THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.923
RELIEF PACKAGE. AND SO IN LIGHT

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.092
OF THIS WE OFFER TWO

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.660
OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS FOR

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.963
THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST IS

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.832
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.834
LIKELY WANT TO DETERMINE HOW TO

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.104
BEST ALLOCATE STATE RESOURCES

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.772
TO THOSE THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.707
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. THE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.175
RECEIVING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:50.380
THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN- WE DON'T

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.181
WANT TO DUPLICATE THAT EFFORT

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.483
WHICH IS REALLY THE SECOND

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.685
POINT IS WELL WHICH IS THAT IN

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.220
GENERAL WE WILL. WE THINK THAT

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.789
YOU WOULD WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.190
STATE INITIATIVE NAY SHOULD IS

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.458
THERE A COMPLEMENT RATHER THAN

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.994
A DUPLICATION OF THE FEDERAL

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:09.132
EFFORTS- WAIT NOTABLE ASPECT OF

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.400
THE PROPOSAL. IS THAT THE

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:12.402
GOVERNOR IS ASKING FOR NEARLY

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.905
THIRTEEN BILLION AND IMMEDIATE

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:18.975
AND FOR EARLY ACTION. RUBLE

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.376
I'LL START WITH THE IMMEDIATE

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.745
ACTION BY WHICH HE'S ASKING FOR

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.113
YOUR APPROVAL WITHIN THE NEXT

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.451
SEVERAL WEEKS- THE FIRST SO WE

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.153
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.387
COUPLE OF THESE THE FIRST IS

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.289
THIS A PROPOSAL FOR- TWO

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.224
BILLION INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:38.327
SCHOOLS TO. RESUME IN PERSON

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:41.097
INSTRUCTION. OUR CONCERN REALLY

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:45.168
IS MORE WITH THE- THE BILITY OF

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.035
THE DISTRICT TO MEET THE

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.071
REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO BE

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.739
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.374
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.377
THEY COULD YOU KNOW MEET THOSE

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:54.944
REQUIREMENTS IN A SHORT TIME

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.380
FRAME. AND I MEAN REALLY WHAT

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.915
OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE WOULDN'T

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.750
WANT TO DISSUADE DISTRICTS FROM

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.118
PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.453
BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:04.921
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MEET

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.957
THE- REQUIREMENTS SO. THAT IS

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.759
THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THAT.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:12.695
AND THEN ON THE- TAX REFUNDS

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:15.264
FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS-

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.300
YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IN THE

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:17.867
RECENT FEDERAL PACKAGE THERE

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:20.803
WAS- THE APPROVAL OF SIX

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.071
HUNDRED DOLLAR STIMULUS CHECKS

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.474
FOR MOST TAXPAYERS. BUT THERE

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.775
ARE SOME THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:29.345
IN THAT AND SO- WE OFFER SOME

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.280
AS ONE ALTERNATIVE WEIGHT IDEAS

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.850
IN OUR REPORT. OR HOW THE STATE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.918
MIGHT- BETTER TARGET THE USE OF

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.220
THIS TWO POINT FOUR BILLION

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:40.223
DOLLARS TO- TO PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.525
NOT. BENEFICIARIES OF THAT

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:47.296
FEDERAL- PROGRAM. AND THEN WHEN

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.931
IT COMES TO THE SMALL BUSINESS

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.933

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.336
FEE WAIVERS THAT ARE INCLUDED

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.238
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.806
ACTUALLY WE GENERALLY THINK

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.407
THESE ARE WORTH CONSIDERING

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.943
THEY ARE GENERALLY REASONABLE-

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:04.480
PROPOSALS- THEN WHEN IT COMES

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.983
TO THE FRAMEWORK- WHEN IT COMES

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:07.950
TO THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.418

LONGER TIME FRAME YOU HAVE A

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.558
LITTLE BIT LONGER TO CONSIDER

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.894
THESE PROPOSALS AND SO. IN

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.995
LIGHT OF THAT WHAT WE OFFER

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.997
HERE IS WE AS TO BEGIN THE

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:22.565
CONVERSATION REALLY. A

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.100
FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO THINK

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.636
ABOUT THESE. I SPECIFICALLY

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.571
WERE SUGGESTING THAT YOU KNOW

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.340
ASK IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.676
IS PROPOSING- IS THERE

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.344
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF A DIRECT

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:37.847
PANDEMIC RELATED PROBLEM THAT'S

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.949
ONE ONE QUESTION. SECOND IS THE

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.417
PROPOSAL ITSELF REALLY THAT

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.519
TIME SENSITIVE WORK IS ALL OF

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.153
THE FUNDING THAT IS BEING

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.389
REQUESTED TIME SENSITIVE MAYBE

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.724
PART OF IT COULD BE PROVIDED

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:50.826
IN. PART OF IT LATER. AND THEN

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.061
FINALLY IS THERE AT IN PLACE AT

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:55.565
THIS- FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:56.933
EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.601
SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.571
THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING FOR. SO

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.506
THAT THAT FIRM HOW WE WOULD

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.475
SUGGEST- PROCEEDING ON THOSE.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:10.012
AT THIS TIME AND THEN- JUST IN

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.214
GENERAL LEAVE AT THE CLOSING

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.816
THOUGHT ON- THIS SO THE

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.451
QUESTION OF BUDGET WAS. AS HAS

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.154
BEEN MENTIONED- ALTHOUGH THE

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.889
CURRENT BUDGET YEAR HAS TURNED

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.357
OUT TO BE IN MUCH BETTER

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:23.392
PHYSICAL CONDITION THAN WE HAD

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:26.195
ANTICIPATED BEFORE THERE ARE A

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.997
SIGNIFICANT FISCAL PRESSURES IN

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:30.800
THE OUT YEARS. AND UP BECAUSE

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:32.435
OF THAT WE THINK THAT YOU WILL

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.437
WANT TO CONSIDER- CONTINUE TO

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.305
KEEP THAT IN MIND THE GOVERNOR

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.707

SOME OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.514
PROPOSAL BUT BECAUSE THERE IS

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.351
STILL THIS A PRETTY SIZEABLE-

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.385
OPERATING DEBT IN THE FUTURE

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.686

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.488
GONNA BE SOMETHING YOU'LL WANT

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.290

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:05.000

DEVASTATION THAT HAS HIT SO

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.523

AND THIS PANDEMIC. AS WE MOVE.

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.998
TO VOTE ON EARLY ACTION ITEMS

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.067
AND PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF OUR

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:13.902
COMMUNITY WE MUST DO SO THROUGH

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.137
THE LENS OF INCLUSION AND

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:17.973
EQUITY. THIS BUDGET RELIES ON

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.007
THE RESILIENT NATURE OF

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.243
CALIFORNIANS BUT WE ALL KNOW

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.743
THAT THE DEVIL IS IN THE

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.346
DETAILS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.514
TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.516

IMMIGRATION STATUS IS PROTECTED

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.552
ENOUGH LIFTED IN TIMES OF

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.388
CRISIS. GIVEN THAT THE GOLDEN

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.923
STATE STIMULUS PROGRAM LOOKS

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.525

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:49.338
THE IMPACT OF THE BAND THE

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:51.606
PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON OUR SMALL

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.809
BUSINESSES. THEREFORE WE MUST

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.210
CONTINUE TO FIND PATHWAYS FOR

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:58.013

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.702
ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER AVENUE

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.971

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.653
NEVER GO AWAY UNLESS WE MAKE

WE TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:17.285

DOING HERE AND ESPECIALLY WITH

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:34.803
THESE EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS I

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.571
THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE.

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.206
REALLY NEED TO TAKE SOME URGENT

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.941
ACTION TO LOOK AT THESE AND

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.042
REALLY TO MAKE THEM BETTER

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.844
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT.

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.579
THERE'S A LOT WANTING HERE IN

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.348
TERMS OF GETTING SPECIFIC

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:49.484
TARGETED. APPROACHES TO THOSE

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.887
WHO NEED IT MOST- I THINK THE

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.256
L. A. O. MADE A VERY GREAT

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.258
POINT AND THAT. MANY OF THESE

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.792
PROPOSALS ARE NOT TARGETED IN

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.261
THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE A NEED

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:03.131
TO BE MUCH MORE FOCUSED- I DO

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:03.665
WANT TO START OFF IS LESS

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.667
ANYONE SAID DON'T. GIVE ANY

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.269
COMPLIMENTS TO THE GOVERNOR I

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.671
DO APPRECIATE. IN THIS BUDGET

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:11.173
THAT THERE IS MONEY FOR SMALL

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:13.742
BUSINESSES I THINK THE FIVE

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:14.309
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:15.010
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.245
NONPROFITS. AS THE L. L. L. A.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.847
O. SAID IS VERY MUCH WORTH

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.849
CONSIDERING THE FEE WAIVERS. I

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:21.816
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.118
DEFINITELY DO WITH MANY OF

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:23.985
THESE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:26.354
STRUGGLING. TO HOP HAVE HAVE

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.223
THEM BE FORCED TO PAY FEES WHEN

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.158
THEY'VE BEEN CLOSED DOWN- SEEMS

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.426
PRETTY UNFAIR TO ME AND IT'S

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:34.229
ONLY JUST. I THINK THAT WE DO.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:37.999
THOSE THINGS. ARE LET ME SAY A

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.202
LITTLE BIT ABOUT- I WILL AGREE

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.070
WITH MY COLLEAGUES. EARLIER

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.506
BOTH- MAKE. MY COLD CALLING

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.774
FROM HEALDSBURG IN MY

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.709
COLLEAGUE- FROM NOW GROVE. WHO

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.511
POINTED OUT THAT THIS ONE POINT

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.513
FIVE BILLION- FOR ELECTRIC

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.448
CHARGING STATIONS. COULD VERY

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.584
MUCH BE SPENT IN OTHER PLACES

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.852
THEY'RE MUCH MORE PRIORITY- BUT

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.088
LET ME ALSO ADD TO THAT- THE

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.256
GOVERNOR IN THIS BUDGET IS

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.124
SAYING THAT THAT. IS CONSISTENT

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.227
WITH A POLICY. THAT HAS BEEN

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.095
SET. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS A

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.698
POLICY THAT WAS NOT SET BY THIS

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:12.167
BODY. BUT A POLICY SET BY THE

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.034
GOVERNOR THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.237
ORDER. WE DID NOT ESTABLISH

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.072
THAT POLICY AS A LEGISLATIVE

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.641
BODY. HE IS FUNDING A POLICY

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.042
THAT HE HIMSELF ESTABLISHED

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.311
THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT WE ARE

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.746
THE LEGISLATURE WE YES WE

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.681
ESTABLISH THE POLICY. AND WHERE

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.515
THEY SHOULD BE GOING I THINK

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:29.050
IT'S ALREADY BEEN OUTLINED VERY

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.820
CLEARLY BY MY COLLEAGUES- THIS

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.521
IS THE WRONG PLACE. TO SPEND

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.190
THAT MONEY ESPECIALLY WITH

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.292
EARLY ACTION MONEY WHERE- WE

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.094
NEED TO GET THIS TO THE THOSE

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.163
IN MOST NEED- THE TWO POINT SIX

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.933
BILLION OF FEDERAL MONEY. RIGHT

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.935
NOW WE'RE NOT REAL CLEAR WHERE

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.003
THAT'S GOING BUT WE'RE WE'RE

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.404
FOCUSING MODE IS LOOKS LIKE A

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.172
FOCUS NOT ON RENTERS AND SMALL

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.541
LANDLORDS SMALL LANDLORDS NEED

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.877
THIS MONEY THE MOST. THEY'RE

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.412
THE ONES THEY'VE GOT NOTHING.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.148
SO FAR WE PASSED THE ADDICTION

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.216
MORE TWENTY BUT WE DID VERY

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.917
LITTLE. TO HELP THE SMALL

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.452
LANDLORDS WHO HAVE BEEN GOING

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.855
WITHOUT RENT PAYMENTS. MANY ARE

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:07.922
VERY STE ARE STRUGGLING THEY'RE

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:09.691
GOING THEIR MORTGAGES ARE ARE

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.327
COMING DUE. OR OR EVEN BEING

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.629
FORECLOSED UPON. SO I THINK WE

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:15.830
SHOULD TARGET THAT MONEY MUCH

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:17.165
MORE CLOSELY A SMALL LANDLORDS

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:18.600
THE EVICTION MORATORIUM HAS

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:19.968
HELPED RUNNERS BECAUSE THEY

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:22.203
HAVEN'T HAD TO PAY RENT. OR

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.172
LEASE ONLY A PORTION OF RENT.

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.407
SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE REALLY

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.841
TARGETED AT TOWARDS THOSE WHO

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.243
HAVE BEEN MOST HURT BY THIS BY

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.978
THAT POLICY OR AT LEAST LEDGE

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:32.247
LET'S SEE THE RESEARCH- LET'S

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.782
SEE THE EVIDENCE OF WHERE THAT

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.317
MONEY COULD BE. BETTER SPENT

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.484
BUT THEN YOU PUT ON TOP OF THAT

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.520
WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:39.087
DOING ANOTHER TWO POINT FOUR

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.389
BILLION. IN A NIGHT THE ITC

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:44.859
REFUND. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.828
THAT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD POLICY

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:47.362
TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.397
LOWEST INCOME BUT WE ALSO WANT

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.332
TO MAKE SURE THAT IS GOING TO

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:51.966
THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.402
AFFECTED OR THE OUT OF WORK.

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:55.370
ARE THEY CURRENTLY OUT OF WORK

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.372
ET DE. IS WERE OUR BIGGEST

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.274
FOCUS NEEDS TO BE. BUT IN THIS

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.810
BUDGET. WE ONLY GOT FIVE

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:03.645
HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION. TO

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:06.314
PAY INTEREST ON UNITY LOANS US

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:06.848
THAT'S ALL OF THE GOVERNOR

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.950
THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT- WITH

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:10.385
REGARD EDIE HOW ABOUT I KNOW

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.253
HOW BOUT AN OVERHAUL. AND

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.555
MAKING SURE THE ACTUAL PAYMENTS

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:16.191
ARE GETTING OUT TO THOSE WHO

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.425
ARE OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.026
THAT'S WHERE WE COME INTO THE

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:21.396
PICTURE. HE'S LEAVING THIS YOU

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:22.964
KNOW TOTALLY BROAD TOLD GRAY

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:24.833
AREA WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.634
MONEY IS GETTING TO THOSE. WHO

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:29.204
NEED IT MOST VACCINES THREE

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.139
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.474
IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET TO GET

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.075
THE VACCINE OUT THE MOST

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.344
IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR US RIGHT

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.313
NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.881
HERD IMMUNITY THROUGH A VACCINE

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:42.117
WE'RE ONLY PUTTING THREE

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:42.717
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION INTO IT

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.119
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:45.019
THE VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.855
GETTING OUT ARE NOT GIVEN THE

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:49.657
ARMS BECAUSE GETTING CAUGHT UP

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.993
IN THIS BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:52.961
AND WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THAT

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.796
NEXT PHASE NEXT PHASES TEACHERS

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.297
ONE B. WE SHOULD BE GETTING

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:57.932
THAT VACCINE OUT TO TEACHERS

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.701
AND STAFF RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.803
CAN OPEN UP SCHOOLS. BUT THAT'S

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.238
NOT HAPPENING THAT'S WHERE I

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.439
THINK WE CAN DO SOME REAL WORK

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:05.740
OF PUSHING THAT IF WE'RE GONNA

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.509
HAVE EARLY PROPOSALS. TO GET

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:09.677
THE MOST GOOD LET'S GET IT OUT

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.912
TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.680
WE ALSO WANT TO GET OUR SCHOOLS

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:13.782
OPEN WITH THE BIGGEST THING WE

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.417
CAN DO TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OPEN.

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.385
IS TO GET OUR TEACHERS. AND

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:20.622
SUPPORT STAFF VACCINATED. SO

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.425
THEY CAN OPEN UP SAFELY. AND

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:26.227

DISTRICTS THIS INCENTIVE GRANT

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:35.703
PROPOSAL IS TO BURDENS AND

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:36.738
EVERYBODY IS SAYING THEY WILL

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.173
NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ALL THE

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.475

ACTUALLY MEET THE CRITERION THE

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.116
REQUIREMENTS TO REOPEN THEIR

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.185
SCHOOLS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.319
THIS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:52.620
PAYMENT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:53.955
WE'RE GOING BACK TO CATEGORICAL

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:56.591
PROGRAMS. I THOUGHT WE DID AWAY

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:57.992
WITH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:24:58.059 --> 01:25:00.662
THAT EVERY SCHOOL. IS GETTING

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.864
SUPPORT SO THEY CAN STAY OPEN-

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:03.932
SO THERE'S SOME SERIOUS

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.233
PROBLEMS WITH HOW THAT IS LAID

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.601
OUT AND IF. AGAIN IF THAT'S

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.769

IT RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.707
IT'S- ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.242
OUR SCHOOLS GET REOPENED IF

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:15.376
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE OF AN

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.378
OBSTACLE THAT NOBODY CAN MEET.

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:18.980
THAT'S NOT HELPING US. DO THE

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:23.251
JOB. UP ONE ONE. HOUR AFTER THE

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:24.986

ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS IN THIS

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.993
BUDGET. OF THE TWO HUNDRED

FIVE MILLION I THINK THAT'S

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.604
GOOD BUT IS IT CONTINUOUS

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.772
APPROPRIATION. IT'S NOT CLEAR

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.040

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:51.813
COMMITMENT. AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.347
THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.115
FRONT LOADING THAT. THESE

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.583
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT

INTO. FORESTRY MANAGEMENT WHICH

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:07.428
REDUCES CARBON. IN WHICH HELPS

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.397
BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY

REDUCING THE FUELS HELPS REDUCE

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.902

THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR OUR

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.795

TO START OFF BY ON SOME

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.250
COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:04.118
FUNDING ON HOMELESSNESS AND

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.753
THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.255
THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.023
PROPOSAL- I'M WHILE I

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.792
APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:13.194
PROPOSED BUDGET ON HOMELESSNESS

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:14.963
I WANTED TO BRING UP SOMETHING

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:16.764
FOR CONSIDERATION AS WE GO INTO

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.099
NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:21.135
MONTHS. I THINK THE REASON THAT

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:23.605
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS NOT

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.240
ADEQUATE IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:30.345
TIME- FUNDING AND THE ONE TIME

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.313
FUNDING OF NATURE OF THESE

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.882
PROPOSALS RESTRICTS OUR STATE'S

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.884
RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS IT

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.519
DOESN'T ALLOW LOCAL

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.521
GOVERNMENTS. AND OTHER

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.523
PROVIDERS TO PLAN FOR MULTIPLE

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.692
YEARS WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:47.428
NEED- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:49.764
INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT NEW ONE

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:51.966
TIME INVESTMENTS OUT. OF WILL

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:53.234
NOT ADVANCE GREATER

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.503
COORDINATION OR ADVANCED

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.639
LEADERSHIP AROUND HOMELESSNESS

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.273
I'M IN FACT IT'S CREATING NEW

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.476
PROGRAMS THAT MULTIPLE AGENCIES

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:03.978
AND NO WAY TO COORDINATE THESE

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:06.247
THESE AGENCIES RESPONSES- ONE

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.016
TIME FUNDING MEANS THAT THE

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.384
MONEY CANNOT BE USED FOR A

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.519
COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TO

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:13.354
HOMELESSNESS. THERE'S NO

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.623
FUNDING FOR SERVICES ANY

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:17.825
HOUSING BASED SERVICES BUT AS

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.227
WE ALL KNOW AND HAVE SEEN IN

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.996
OUR OWN COMMUNITIES ARE VITAL

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:22.497
TO END HOMELESSNESS IN

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:25.400
CALIFORNIA- IF WE CREATE NEW

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:27.969
PROGRAMS THAT. WILL POTENTIALLY

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.738
ONLY LIVE FOR ONE YEAR. ESPITE

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.274
OF WHAT WE KNOW. THAT THERE

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:34.676
WILL BE INCREASES IN

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.277
HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE IN

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:39.013
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND I

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.348
REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:40.982
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.051
FOCUSED ON AS YOU REMEMBER LAST

THE STATE FOCUSED ON

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:48.289
HOMELESSNESS. AND WE MUST NOT

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.924
FORGET THAT THAT IS STILL AN

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:56.264

CLARIFICATION ON- ON WHAT THEY

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.656
ARE IDENTIFYING AS BARRIERS.

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.158
BECAUSE I'M FROM WHAT I

01:29:57.225 --> 01:30:00.094
UNDERSTAND THEY WERE NOT- NO

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.596
ONE CONNECTED WITH THEM BEFORE

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.197
THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT I'M VERY

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:06.834
CONCERNED- ABOUT LARGE SCHOOL

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.603
DISTRICTS ABILITY TO MEET THE

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:11.305
REQUIREMENTS IN THE SAFE SCHOOL

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:12.940
FOR ALL PROPOSAL I'M CONCERNED

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:15.710
ABOUT EQUITY. OF ESPECIALLY IN

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:18.179
LOS ANGELES WHERE THE MAJORITY

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.448
OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND LA

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:23.584
SCHOOLS ARE LOW INCOME- AND

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.553
UNDER REPRESENTED IN OUR STATE.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.321
A. N. AND SO I'M CONCERNED

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.923
ABOUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BEING

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.592
ABLE TO MEET. THOSE

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:33.728
REQUIREMENTS. YES A ONE THAT

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:34.529
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.264
REACHED OUT TO OTHER

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.498
SUPERINTENDENTS AND THEIR STAFF

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:42.603
ON IS THE- THE ASSERTION THAT-

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.506
THEY WERE NOT AT. WE DIDN'T

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:48.976
SEEK OUT THERE- AS- INPUT PRIOR

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.878
TO CREATING THIS- PROPOSAL

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:51.746
BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DID

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.447
RECENTLY DID REACH OUT TO NOT

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.616
JUST THE SEVEN SUPERINTENDENTS

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:56.317
THAT WERE ON THE LIST BUT TO

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.019
MANY OTHERS AS WELL- SO THAT

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.854
WAS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING-

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:02.590
HOWEVER AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:04.659
THAT. LIKE L. A. U. S. T. MANY

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:06.060
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.162
EQUITY ISSUES. AND JUST WANT TO

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:09.597
POINT OUT THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.766
DOES ALLOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:18.306

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:21.876
HI AND TRY RATES OF CODE NINE.

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:22.643
AND ALLOW THEM TO PART- EVEN IF

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:25.379
THEY ARE BY- THE TWENTY EIGHT

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:26.881
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RATE- THAT

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.317
ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP THEM FROM

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.885
REOPENING. I'M SO THOSE FUNDS

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.453
ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS I

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.788
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FUNDS

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:35.423
ARE GENERATED BY ALL EDA BUT

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:38.259

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.093
PEOPLES WHO ARE RECEIVING

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.261

WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:50.304
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EQUITY

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:50.905

THAT LEARNING FROM SOME OF THE-

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.124

MORE BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:16.970

IS THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:28.014
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:30.483

I WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S A MULTI

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:45.065
LAYERED WE- PROPOSE CAL. WHICH

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:46.599

ARE TO REALLY GET AT THE ROOT

01:51:58.378 --> 01:52:00.647
CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS- BUT WE

01:52:00.713 --> 01:52:02.549

THE PDP FONG THE DOCTOR BALL-

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:44.791

CRITIQUES ESPECIALLY OF THE

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:20.560
DEDUCTIBLE- AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.028
WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT WOULD

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:24.230
REALLY BE A- A MOVE THAT WOULD

MORE BROADLY TO ALL OF THE

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:06.933
THINGS THE STATE. COULD BE

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:09.402
DOING TO TRY TO- COMBAT THE

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:11.637
PANDEMIC AND HELP THE ECONOMY

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:13.973
RECOVER- SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.942
THINK ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:17.410
DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE PPP

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.879
EXPENSES AGAINST. ALL THE OTHER

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:21.447

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:27.353
AS- THINGS THE STATE COULD BE

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.521
DOING MORE BROADLY TO HELP THE

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:30.756
ECONOMY. RECOVER AND TO GET THE

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:32.425
PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. ARE

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:36.429
THERE ARE THERE. ALTERNATIVES

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:37.897
RECOMMENDATIONS. BESIDES THE

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:39.165
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:00:39.231 --> 02:00:40.333
OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET HE WOULD

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:45.504
RECOMMEND. I DON'T THINK WE

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:47.239
HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR

02:00:47.306 --> 02:00:48.608
YOU AT THIS TIME BUT IT'S

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:49.275
CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:51.777
BEEN- DELIBERATING ON AND

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:54.480
SOMETHING WE PLAN TO OFFER THE

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:57.550
LEGISLATURE SUGGESTIONS ON THAT

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:58.684
WHEN WITH THE PROCESS. OKAY AT

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.519
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.855
IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON- STATE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:05.558
CONFORMITY. REGARDED AS THE

02:01:05.625 --> 02:01:12.465
TECH FIVE BILLION PPP. SURE.

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.000
THAT PACKAGE WAS PASSED LATE

02:01:14.066 --> 02:01:15.201
DECEMBER SO WE HAVEN'T HAD A

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:16.869
CHANCE TO REALLY DIVE INTO THAT

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:19.572
BUT- IN REGARDS TO ANY P. P. P.

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:22.441
OF CONFORMITY. PPP CONFORMITY

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:23.609
AT THE STATE LEVEL WE WOULD

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:25.411
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS TO

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:28.381
OUT- TO THE REGION IN TERMS OF

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:30.416
REVENUES. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:31.884
KNOW WE HAVE A FIFTEEN BILLION

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.386
DOLLAR ONE TIME SURPLUS THAT

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:35.554
WE'RE FORECASTING AND BEING-

02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:37.323
VERY PRUDENT IN TRYING TO SPEND

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:39.358
THAT I ONE TIME. DOLLARS A ONE

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:41.460
TIME INVESTMENT- SO THIS IS

02:01:41.527 --> 02:01:42.795
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE THAT IS

02:01:42.862 --> 02:01:44.296
NOT CONSIDERED IT'S NOT PART

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.065
OBVIOUSLY OF OUR BUDGET BECAUSE

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.299
OF THAT THE TIMING TIMING OF

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:49.201
THIS- BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:52.405
CONSIDER THE- POTENTIAL IMPACTS

02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:54.573

THE COST OF. THAT INCREASE I

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.521
THINK THAT- FREQUENCY. THERE

02:02:08.587 --> 02:02:09.889
HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF DETAILS IN

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:10.790

HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:29.909
THESE TESTS. SURE AND I WOULD

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.911
JUST ADD TO MY COLLEAGUE-

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:33.045

STUDENTS- IN REGARDS TO THE DAY

02:02:52.164 --> 02:02:53.466
TWO BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:54.300
THERE'S A FOUR POINT SIX

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:55.668
BILLION DOLLAR THE PROPOSAL

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.803

THERE TO ASSIST SCHOOLS AND-

02:03:01.006 --> 02:03:03.542
DEALING WITH THE IMPACT OF. THE

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.377
DOCUMENT EDUCATION FOR OUR

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:08.748
CHILDREN- BUT TESTING IS ONE OF

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:11.383
THE- ELIGIBLE- EFFORTS UNDER

02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:12.351
THE TWO BILLION AND IT'S

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:14.286
SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:15.421

IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. AND I

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:24.063
THINK THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:25.965
LOOK INTO- PROPORTION OF THE

02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:28.000
STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE-

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:30.636
ELIGIBLE FOR. MEDICARE AND SO

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:31.437
THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:32.805
FEDERAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:34.440
HELPING WITH THE TESTING COUGH

02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:38.377
AS WELL. OKAY I MEAN I THINK

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:40.646
THAT THAT'S IT YOU KNOW I THINK

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:42.014
HE SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.716
BASIC THE CONCERN I THINK FROM

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:44.884
JUST THE REALITY OF THE

02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:46.619
SITUATION IS THAT THERE ARE

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:48.354
REAL CONCERNS AMONGST OUR

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:50.356
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:52.191
QUESTIONED THE STATE'S ABILITY

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:53.058
TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE WHAT NEEDS

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:55.394
TO BE ACHIEVED TO REOPEN

02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.529
SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW.

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:58.531
THAT OUR ECONOMY OUR HEALTH

02:03:58.597 --> 02:04:01.567
CARE CAPACITY. AND JUST- OUR

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:02.701
SOCIETY AT LARGE ISN'T GOING TO

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:04.670
BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY IF WE

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:05.371
DON'T REOPEN THE SCHOOLS

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:07.740
SAFELY- IN TERMS OF DEFERRALS

02:04:07.807 --> 02:04:09.542
AND I THINK MAYBE DEPARTMENT

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:10.709
FINANCE CAN. ANSWER THIS FIRST

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.545
AND THEN I'LL GET THE

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:14.246
PERSPECTIVE OF ELIO. WHY ARE WE

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:17.049
TALKING ABOUT FULLY ADDRESSING

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:17.750
THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF THE

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:19.718
DEFERRALS COMPLETELY- I KNOW

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.754
THAT THAT THAT. THE L. A. O. AS

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:23.022
OUTLINED CONCERNS WITH

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:24.456
OPERATING DEFICITS MOVING. BY

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:25.724
MOVING FORWARD AND OTHER BUDGET

02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:27.760
YEARS THAT WILL GET LARGER. AND

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:30.830
WE HAVE. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:31.463
PAYING DOWN TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:34.233
DEFERRALS. BUT THEN PROPOSING

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.669
ONGOING- COSTS OF LIVING

02:04:36.735 --> 02:04:39.672
INCREASES WILL- THAT WOULD

02:04:39.738 --> 02:04:41.607
EXACERBATE THE ONGOING-

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:43.342
DEFICITS IN THE FUTURE. WHAT

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.610
ARE THE PROS AND CONS OR MAYBE

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.378
WHAT'S THE IT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:47.112
THE THINKING OR THE THOUGHT

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:49.949
PROCESS OF. WHY NOT PAY OFF ALL

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.917
THE REFERRALS WE DID LAST YEAR.

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:55.221
WITH GOALS. SURE AND YES THANK

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:57.022
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I THINK

02:04:57.089 --> 02:04:59.425
THE EASY ANSWER THE SIMPLE

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.694
ANSWER TO THAT IS TO- PAY OFF

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:02.795
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THOUGH

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:06.398
THAT- IN REGARDS TO ALL OF. THE

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.400

DEFERRALS WITH IT FOR THE

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.203
POTENTIALLY A CASH FLOW ISSUE

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.738
BUT ALSO LEAVING ROOM FOR OTHER

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.440
THINGS- THE NEED TO GET DONE

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:19.511
AND SO. IN TERMS OF- PRIORITIES.

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:20.479
THAT MADE ROOM FOR OTHER PEOPLE-

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:22.147
BUT SAID I WOULD I WOULD SAY

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:23.949
THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET-

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:24.850
IS THE START OF THE

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:27.253
CONVERSATION AND- WE LOOK

02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:28.954
FORWARD TO. THE WEEKS AND

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:32.558
MONTHS AHEAD AND- TO CONSIDER

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:37.096
OTHER ALTERNATIVES. YES MISTER

THAT. YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS WOULD

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:45.504
VIEW THE BUDGET REALLY AS- TO

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:47.606
BUDGETS IN ONE BECAUSE THE PROP

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:48.741
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET IS SEPARATE

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.709
NO WAY AND SO. ACTUALLY THE

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.144
OPERATING DEFICITS WERE

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:53.312
PROJECTING IN THE FUTURE UNDER

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.180

BEING SAID I THINK OUR OFFICE

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:02.321
WOULD VIEW THAT- IT WOULD BE

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:03.822
WORTH YOUR CONSIDERATION TO ADD

02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:04.924
MORE TO PAYING DOWN THE

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:07.326
DEFERRALS BECAUSE- WE DO HAVE

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:09.328
MORE RESOURCES THIS YEAR THAN

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:10.796
WE MAY AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:12.298
ITSELF MIGHT BE THE RIGHT TIME

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:14.700
TO PAY DOWN THAT- WHAT IS

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:16.335
ESSENTIALLY A ONE TIME DEBT.

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:18.871

ASKED THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:32.718

FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.489
REFERRALS. SO IT WOULD. AT

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:38.490
LEAST IN MY OPINION TO BE

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:40.626

02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:41.592
ACTUALLY NEEDED IN THE

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.161

DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:15.593
SO- I THINK THIS IS- AN AREA

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:16.994
WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:19.330
MADE A YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF

INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE- AND

02:27:21.832 --> 02:27:23.501
I THINK AS WE GET OUTSIDE OF

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:25.336
THIS PANDEMIC WILL WILL HAVE TO

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:27.505
LOOK. TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND

02:27:27.572 --> 02:27:30.041

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:33.144
OF WHAT KIND OF PLANS WE NEED

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:34.912

02:27:55.032 --> 02:27:56.567
OF GOOD WORK IN THIS AREA

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:57.168
THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE LAST

THERE ARE STILL REGIONS OF OUR

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:19.490
STATE THAT STRUGGLE. TO BE ABLE

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.459
TO HAVE THE PROVIDERS TO DEAL

WITH THIS PANDEMIC. AND IN

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.396

JUST DON'T JUST LET PEOPLE OUT

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:20.638

THEY GET OUT SO THEY DON'T.

02:31:22.573 --> 02:31:24.642

DO RELEASE THEM THAT THEY DON'T

02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:36.754
CREATE PROBLEMS DOWN IN OUR

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:40.090
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT AS

FORTY THOUSAND HOW MUCH IS CDC

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:56.006
ARE SAVED. AS A RESULT OF THESE

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.075
POPULATION REDUCTIONS. WHERE

02:32:05.316 --> 02:32:09.753
WHAT AREAS. IN ADDITION. IS THE

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:12.189
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:14.792
ADDITIONAL PRISON CLOSURES

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:16.427
BASED ON THE L. A. L.'S

02:32:16.494 --> 02:32:18.462
POPULATION PROJECTIONS THAT

02:32:18.529 --> 02:32:21.665
INDICATE FIVE PRISONS CAN BE

02:32:21.732 --> 02:32:25.302

NOT ONLY DOES SAVINGS BUT ALSO

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:40.684
MAKING SURE SAME QUESTION ISN'T

02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:41.652
RELEASING PEOPLE WOULD CLOVER

02:32:41.719 --> 02:32:43.621
PROBLEM DO WE HAVE A WRAPAROUND

02:32:43.687 --> 02:32:46.724
SERVICE PLAN ON THE OUTSIDE.

02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:48.726
SHE WOULD DIVERT AT ONE POINT

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:50.194
FIVE MILLION TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:51.161
THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T

02:32:51.228 --> 02:32:52.830
RECIDIVISTS SHOULD WE PUT IN

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:54.865
ALL THE SERVICES MAYBE EVEN TO

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:57.067
COMMUNITY GROUPS SO THAT TYPE

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:58.769
OF GOING TO A COMMUNITY OF

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.304
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN

02:33:00.371 --> 02:33:02.273
FORMALLY INCARCERATED WHO CAN

02:33:02.339 --> 02:33:03.040
MAKE SURE THAT THESE

02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:06.710
INDIVIDUALS AGAIN DON'T BECOME

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:07.311
A PROBLEM WHEN THEY GET OUT.

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:11.348
AND THEN FINALLY. CAMERAS

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:12.583
THERE'S A TOTAL OF THIRTY

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:14.151
MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE

02:33:14.218 --> 02:33:15.319
YEARS FOR CAMERAS BOTH

STATIONARY. AND BODY CAMERAS R.

02:33:18.923 --> 02:33:21.992
J. DONOVAN DUE TO THE LAWSUIT

02:33:22.059 --> 02:33:24.495
WHICH INCIDENTLY. THE STATE

02:33:24.562 --> 02:33:27.364
ADMINISTRATION CDC R. B. P. H.

02:33:27.431 --> 02:33:30.067
IS APPEALING. I DON'T

02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:30.868
UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD NOT BE

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:32.736
PUTTING BODY CAMERAS ON

02:33:32.803 --> 02:33:36.340
EVERYONE. IN CDC ARE SPECIALLY

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:37.775
TO PRISON GUARD IT PROTECTS

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:41.745
THEM FROM FRIVOLOUS COMPLAINTS

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:44.548
BY INMATES BUT ALSO LET US KNOW

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:45.349
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:46.850
INTERACTION BETWEEN PRISON

02:33:46.917 --> 02:33:48.319
GUARDS AND INMATES IT WORKS

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:50.888
BOTH WAYS BOTH ENTITIES CAN DO

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:53.290
THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:55.426
SAY WE'RE APPEALING. BEING ABLE

02:33:55.492 --> 02:33:58.062
TO PUT BODY CAMERAS ON EVERYONE

02:33:58.128 --> 02:34:00.998
IN CDC ARE I DON'T KNOW ONE WHY

02:34:01.065 --> 02:34:02.499
THAT IS A PROBLEM TO WHICH

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.767
ADMINISTRATION- TO TALKING

02:34:03.834 --> 02:34:05.803
ABOUT THIS ONE APPEALING THE

02:34:05.869 --> 02:34:07.871
DECISION. BY THE PREVIOUS

02:34:07.938 --> 02:34:09.006
ADMINISTRATION BUT MORE

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:13.043
IMPORTANT WHY. ARE WE PROVIDING

02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:15.012
BODY CAMERAS DISAGREED START AT

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:16.714
ONE FACILITY BUT WE NEED TO

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.549
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS IT

02:34:18.616 --> 02:34:21.185
AND SO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM IF

02:34:21.251 --> 02:34:21.752
THERE'S A THERE'S A LOGICAL

02:34:21.819 --> 02:34:23.821
REASON. HOPEFULLY BETTER THAN

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:25.889
ONE THAT I WAS GIVEN THAT SHE

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:27.358
PRISON GUARDS CAN JUST TURN THE

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.660
CAMERAS OFF. MY ANSWER WAS. YOU

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:32.363
DO KNOW THEY MAKE. CAMERAS THAT

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.131
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T TURN OFF

02:34:34.198 --> 02:34:37.134
SO. LET ME KNOW WHAT WHAT'S

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:38.102
GOING ON BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:34:38.168 --> 02:34:40.904
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR BOTH

02:34:40.971 --> 02:34:43.273
SIDES IN THE INSTABILITY. SOB

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.009
LEAVE IT UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.343
WANT TO COME TO MY OFFICE WE

02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:48.345
WANNA DO IT AND- END UP BUT

02:34:48.412 --> 02:34:51.415
JUST A FIVE. MINUTE PENALTY

02:34:51.482 --> 02:34:53.817
HOURS LATE. SO YEAH I THINK

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:55.319
THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS-

02:34:55.386 --> 02:34:57.054
I THINK I CAN ANSWER ONE RIGHT

02:34:57.121 --> 02:34:59.256
NOW AND THAT IS THE- YEAH THERE

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:00.824
WERE TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.326
TRIGGER CUTS FOR THE COURTS.

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:04.228
AND WE HAVE A THREE POINT 7%

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:06.030
INCREASE IN THE CURRENT.

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:07.698
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT BRINGS

02:35:07.765 --> 02:35:09.299
IT UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:11.769
SO JUST THAT'S- THAT THE COURTS

02:35:11.835 --> 02:35:12.636
ARE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:35:12.703 --> 02:35:16.407
EFFICIENCIES TO PREFER SAVINGS-

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.275
AND ARE THE OTHER QUESTIONS WE

02:35:18.342 --> 02:35:19.843
WILL GET BACK TO YOU. WE CAN

02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:21.612
HAVE- STAFF REPUBLICAN REJECT

02:35:21.679 --> 02:35:23.547
YOUR STAFF AND SET UP. MEETINGS

02:35:23.614 --> 02:35:26.550
FOR FOLLOW UP. AND SO IN ON THE

02:35:26.617 --> 02:35:28.485
COURT THE ONE YOU DID ANSWER IT

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:29.620
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'LL MAKE

02:35:29.687 --> 02:35:31.355
THEM WHOLE BLOOD TO RUN INTO MY

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:34.591
OFFICE AFTER I GET OUT OF HERE.

02:35:34.658 --> 02:35:35.359
AND SAY THEY'RE NOT BEING MADE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:37.428
WHOLE BUTTE. WELL I THINK WE'RE

02:35:37.494 --> 02:35:38.529
I THINK WE'RE NOT REVISITING

02:35:38.595 --> 02:35:40.197
THE TRIGGER CUTS AND THAT WAY I

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:41.899
THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

02:35:41.965 --> 02:35:44.034
CAN- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:35:44.101 --> 02:35:45.469
INCREASES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:46.770
TRIAL COURT AS WELL AS YOU SEE

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:48.405
AND SEE IF YOU WERE PROVIDED.

02:35:48.472 --> 02:35:52.042
ADDITIONAL A FUNDING- BOTH ONE

02:35:52.109 --> 02:35:54.011
TIME AND ONGOING- DOESN'T

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:55.379
EXACTLY MATCH UP TO THOSE

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:57.214
TRIGGER CUTS- BUT BUT THERE

02:35:57.281 --> 02:35:59.049
ARE. THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE'RE

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:00.417
TRYING TO HELP AND SUPPORT

02:36:00.484 --> 02:36:04.421
THOSE- ENTITIES. BLACKROCK I'M

02:36:04.488 --> 02:36:06.623
OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE THE

CONSTITUENTS. ARE EDUCATORS AND

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:28.705
THEIR FAMILIES BUT I AM VERY

02:37:28.772 --> 02:37:30.941
WORRIED THAT WE ARE. MOTIVATING

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:32.609
A PLAN BY THE CALENDAR AND NOT

02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.144
BY THE SCIENCE OR DATA SHOWING

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:35.946
WE ARE CURRENTLY APPROACHING

02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:37.881
THE THIRTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN

02:37:37.948 --> 02:37:39.516
THE STATE. WE ARE IN WHAT SOME

02:37:39.583 --> 02:37:43.887
OF THE DARKEST PERIOD OF THIS

02:37:43.954 --> 02:37:44.421
CRISIS OF THIS PANDEMIC.

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:45.989
WITHOUT AND PERHAPS HOPEFULLY

02:37:46.056 --> 02:37:46.890
WILL GET BETTER EVEN THOUGH THE

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:47.724
VACCINE IS ROLLING OUT RIGHT

02:37:47.791 --> 02:37:49.393
NOW. AND JUST AS AN

02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:51.295
ILLUSTRATION IN MY HOME COUNTY

02:37:51.361 --> 02:37:53.297
OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IT USED

02:37:53.363 --> 02:37:54.798
TO BE THAT WHEN YOU HIT READ

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:56.667
HERE YOU CAN MAKE A PLAN FOR

02:37:56.733 --> 02:37:57.701
TWO WEEKS AND THEN REOPEN THE

02:37:57.768 --> 02:37:59.436
SCHOOLS. WELL THE ENTIRE STATE

02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:00.771
IS ESSENTIALLY IN SUCH A DEEP

02:38:00.838 --> 02:38:02.306
PURPLE THAT WE HAVE RUN OUT OF

02:38:02.372 --> 02:38:04.308
COLORS. THAT WE ARE IN SUCH A

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:06.143
DEEP STATE. THAT I AM REALLY

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:07.978
AFRAID THAT WE ARE MOVING. THAT

02:38:08.045 --> 02:38:09.346
WE'RE MOVING INTO A STATE

02:38:09.413 --> 02:38:11.782
WHERE- ARE MOTIVATED BY THE

02:38:11.849 --> 02:38:13.817
DATE RATHER THAN WHAT THE

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:14.685
SCIENCE IS AND WHAT IS

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.854
HAPPENING. SO IT IS PARAMOUNT

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.055
IMPORTANCE TO ALL OUR

02:38:18.121 --> 02:38:19.990
CONSTITUENCIES AND TO US. THAT

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:21.425
THE SAFETY OF THE EDUCATORS OF

02:38:21.491 --> 02:38:22.659
THE STUDENTS AND THE FAMILIES

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:23.861
ARE PRIORITIZE WHEN WE ARE

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:25.262
REOPENING THE SCHOOLS. SO

02:38:25.329 --> 02:38:26.864
THAT'S REALLY MY QUESTION IS.

02:38:26.930 --> 02:38:28.765
WHY ARE WE PUTTING THE PRESSURE

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:30.767
DATE OF FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH AND

02:38:30.834 --> 02:38:32.569
MARCH. AS I FAVOR SIXTEENTH AND

02:38:32.636 --> 02:38:34.705
MARCH FIFTEENTH. TO PRESSURE

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.506
THE SCHOOLS TO MAKE THESE PLANS

02:38:36.573 --> 02:38:37.608
WHEN IN FACT WE'VE HEARD THAT

02:38:37.674 --> 02:38:38.575
THERE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:38:38.642 --> 02:38:39.843
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:42.045
CONSULTATION. IS IT. BY FEDERAL

02:38:42.112 --> 02:38:43.380
LAW IS THERE SOMETHING

02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:44.615
DICTATING THAT WORRIES THAT A

02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:46.049
PERIOD. IN WHICH WE CAN

02:38:46.116 --> 02:38:49.052
NEGOTIATE AND FIGURE OUT SO

02:38:49.119 --> 02:38:49.653
LET'S NOT ARTIFICIAL PRESSURE

02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:51.755
POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE- THANK

02:38:51.822 --> 02:38:53.790
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. I'M I

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:55.726
THINK THE DATE- ILLUSTRATES THE

02:38:55.792 --> 02:38:58.395
URGENCY OF THE MATTER- AND HOW

02:38:58.462 --> 02:39:00.197
THE ADMINISTRATION SEES IT-

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:02.199
THAT SAID AGAIN- I THINK THIS

02:39:02.266 --> 02:39:04.034
IS A POINT OF CONVERSATION. AND

02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:06.036
WE HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN WITH-

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:08.572
SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND TRADE

02:39:08.639 --> 02:39:10.173
TRYING TO INFORM THE PLAN BASED

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:11.842
ON WHAT WE HEAR. THE FEEDBACK

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:13.243
AND SO I THINK THAT MORE

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:16.413
CONVERSATIONS NEED TO HAPPEN.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:16.980
REGARDING THE PROPOSAL AS A

02:39:17.047 --> 02:39:19.516

SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE

02:39:22.786 --> 02:39:24.187
LEGISLATURE. IN MAKING

02:39:24.254 --> 02:39:25.455
DECISIONS BECAUSE THE LAST

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:27.324
THING YOU WANT IS TO FEEL THAT

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:28.258
THE SCHOOLS MUST MAKE AN

02:39:28.325 --> 02:39:29.893
IMPROPER INAPPROPRIATE PLAN TO

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.595

CALIFORNIA I THINK IT IS A

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:03.560
FABULOUS USE OF ONE TIME MONEY-

02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:04.895

THIS. SURPLUS FOR ONE TIME

02:40:09.933 --> 02:40:11.735
PURPOSES WE KNOW THAT IF WE

SCHOOL DISTRICTS THING IT'S

02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.971
NOT. NECESSARILY DOABLE WE

02:41:21.038 --> 02:41:22.072
DON'T WANT THIS MONEY JUST TO

GO AS A WINDFALL TO THE WEALTHY

02:41:23.507 --> 02:41:24.641
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:25.909
ALREADY IN THE APPROPRIATE

MAY BE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:41:45.262 --> 02:41:47.531
THAT DO NOTHING- WHEN THEY GET

02:41:47.597 --> 02:41:49.366

A REQUIREMENT THAT WE DO GET

02:42:04.281 --> 02:42:06.650
SOME- INSTRUCTION OTHERWISE.

MOST DISTRICTS THE SUN GOES

02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:24.353
DOWN EARLY. AND WHAT WE'RE

02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:26.122
FINDING IS IN OUR CITIES I'M

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:27.223
GETTING CALLS FROM OUR CITY

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:28.658
COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT ARE SAYING

02:54:28.724 --> 02:54:30.726
THAT IT'S DARK AND THE POWER

02:54:30.793 --> 02:54:32.829

EVENTS ARE HAPPENING MORE

02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:44.240
FREQUENTLY WHY DOES THIS BUDGET

02:54:44.307 --> 02:54:46.676
NOT INCLUDE BETTER FUNDING TO

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:48.644
EQUIP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:49.879
WITH THE NECESSITIES AND THE

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:52.582
TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. AND THEY

02:54:52.648 --> 02:54:53.216
HAVE TO FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:00.089
OF GOOD THINGS THAT COULD BE IN

02:55:00.156 --> 02:55:02.291
THIS BUDGET AND- AS I SAID

02:55:02.358 --> 02:55:03.993
BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:12.501

YOU DON'T SEE IN THERE I'M NOT

BECAUSE THEY WERE IMPORTANT

02:55:19.675 --> 02:55:21.711
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK- WE NEED

02:55:21.777 --> 02:55:22.845
TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:25.114
THAT RIGHT SO WHY WAS THE

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:26.249
DECISION MADE TO CUT THE

02:55:26.315 --> 02:55:28.117
FUNDING AS WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE

02:55:28.184 --> 02:55:30.086
MORE SHORT OFFICE THAN WE HAVE

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:45.501
GOVERNOR THE BUDGET DOES HAVE

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:47.136
I'M SO REALLY GOOD PROVISIONS

THERE'S FORTY FOUR MILLION

02:55:48.037 --> 02:55:50.339

02:56:02.151 --> 02:56:03.185
IMPRESSION THAT THE PAROLE

02:56:03.252 --> 02:56:05.521
PROPOSAL PROVIDES TOO LITTLE

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:06.622

FEBRUARY FIRST- AND- THAT WOULD

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:07.296
BE BASED ON SOME ADDITIONAL

RELEASED- AND THINGS. LIKE IT'S

03:05:13.101 --> 03:05:15.404
VERY VERY SHORT WINDOW FOR A

03:05:15.471 --> 03:05:16.438
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:18.307
REVIEW THAT BOB THOSE PLANS AND

FILE TO BE OPENED SCHOOLS BUT

03:05:22.945 --> 03:05:23.745
THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE'VE

03:05:23.812 --> 03:05:25.347
HEARD IT AGAIN THIS GRANT IS

03:05:25.414 --> 03:05:26.482
NOT AVAILABLE YET SO WE DON'T

03:05:26.548 --> 03:05:27.850
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE LISTING

03:05:27.916 --> 03:05:29.618
CADENCES. BUT THE TESTING AT

03:05:29.685 --> 03:05:31.987
THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT MAYBE-

03:05:32.054 --> 03:05:33.121
SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT NEED TO

03:05:33.188 --> 03:05:34.957
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO

03:05:35.023 --> 03:05:37.192
PUT THAT ON THE MOST OF IT BUT

03:05:37.259 --> 03:05:37.993
THEY COULD BRING STUDENTS BACK

03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:40.062
A LEVEL THAT IS EXPECTED IN THE

03:05:40.128 --> 03:05:41.497
PROPOSAL. SO THAT'S OUR OUR

03:05:41.563 --> 03:05:44.867
MAIN CONCERN WE REYES- ONE

03:05:44.933 --> 03:05:46.702
ALTERNATIVE IN OUR OLD REWARDS

03:05:46.768 --> 03:05:49.805
TO- SLOW DOWN THAT EVEN A

03:05:49.872 --> 03:05:50.639
LITTLE BIT SO THAT MAYBE A

03:05:50.706 --> 03:05:53.141
MISSILE REQUIREMENTS IT'S NOT

03:05:53.208 --> 03:05:54.877
ALL TO GIVE TO STUDENTS BUT

03:05:54.943 --> 03:05:56.011
BROKE UP OF A HIGHER NEED

03:05:56.078 --> 03:05:57.679
STUDENTS COMING FIRST. SCHOOL

03:05:57.746 --> 03:06:00.015
DISTRICTS CAN GET UP AND

03:06:00.082 --> 03:06:02.618
RUNNING- DON'T LOOK AROUND CITY

03:06:02.684 --> 03:06:04.419
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THOSE

03:06:04.486 --> 03:06:06.622
STUDENTS- AND THEN I WOULD MAKE

03:06:06.688 --> 03:06:07.689
IT EASIER FOR RAMPING UP AND I

03:06:07.756 --> 03:06:08.991
THINK ALSO SIMILARLY I THINK WE

03:06:09.057 --> 03:06:10.792
HAVE SOME. CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:06:10.859 --> 03:06:13.395
CAPACITY FOR BOTH THE STATE AND

03:06:13.462 --> 03:06:14.530
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO BE

03:06:14.596 --> 03:06:15.564
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF

03:06:15.631 --> 03:06:17.266
SUPPORT MIGHT NOT MIGHT BE

03:06:17.332 --> 03:06:19.301
NECESSARY IF- HUNDREDS OF

03:06:19.368 --> 03:06:20.569
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO

03:06:20.636 --> 03:06:33.715
DO THIS ALL THE TIME. TO

03:06:33.782 --> 03:06:34.283
DEVELOP PLANS TO GET UP AND

03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.883
RUNNING RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:35.851
JUST A IT'S THE BY HAVE YOU A

03:06:35.918 --> 03:06:36.518
FOLLOW UP WHAT IT WHAT DID YOU.

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:37.553
OF THAT WERE SENT OVER BY THE

03:06:37.619 --> 03:06:39.054
LARGE DISTRICT- OUTLINING FOR

03:06:39.121 --> 03:06:41.089
OF THEIR- THERE CAN. YEAH SURE

03:06:41.156 --> 03:06:45.427
WE DID REGULAR. CLARITY UNDER

03:06:45.494 --> 03:06:46.695
OF HOW THE WORK I THINK THAT

03:06:46.762 --> 03:06:48.931
LED DID THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:06:48.997 --> 03:06:50.766
WERE IN ARAB GOING DEEPER

03:06:50.832 --> 03:06:52.200
WOULDN'T ABLE TO FOR GOING I

03:06:52.267 --> 03:06:53.902
THINK MY UNDERSTAND OF DIMINISH

03:06:53.969 --> 03:06:55.837
PROPOSAL THAT ARE THOSE

03:06:55.904 --> 03:06:57.205
DISTRICTS ONE BE ABLE TO FOR

03:06:57.272 --> 03:06:57.940
ONE THEY WOULD BE TO BE MADE

03:06:58.006 --> 03:07:00.642
THOSE- AGAIN. AND THEY WERE

03:07:00.709 --> 03:07:02.244
RECEIVE FUNDING AND YEAH IS

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:04.046
THAT THEY WOULDN'T BEGIN TO

03:07:04.112 --> 03:07:06.448
OPEN UP TO OBEY THE CASES IN

03:07:06.515 --> 03:07:08.250
THOSE COUNTIES WERE AT LEVELS

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:08.750
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU THE

03:07:08.817 --> 03:07:11.353
PROGRAM- SO THAT'S ONE THING I

03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:13.522
WOULD HIGHLIGHT I THINK REGULAR

03:07:13.589 --> 03:07:15.324
THOSE CONCERNS A LOOK I THINK

03:07:15.390 --> 03:07:16.291
IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SIDE I

03:07:16.358 --> 03:07:17.793
THINK WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT

03:07:17.859 --> 03:07:19.394
TESTING REQUIREMENTS I THINK

03:07:19.461 --> 03:07:21.396
THERE'S A BIG- I THINK THAT'S

03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:21.997
WHAT THE CHANCES AND TRYING TO

03:07:22.064 --> 03:07:23.699
ASSESS THE FISCAL COSTS OF THIS

03:07:23.765 --> 03:07:25.400
PROPOSAL. IF IT'S FOR EXAMPLE

03:07:25.467 --> 03:07:27.569
ALMOST EVERYBODY BECAUSE ONCE A

03:07:27.636 --> 03:07:29.037
WEEK I CAN BE A PRETTY

03:07:29.104 --> 03:07:31.340
SUBSTANTIAL COST- BUT I

03:07:31.406 --> 03:07:32.841
REMEMBER THERE WAS SIX BILLION

03:07:32.908 --> 03:07:33.575
IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING

03:07:33.642 --> 03:07:35.611
PROVIDED- IN THIS LAST BUDGET

03:07:35.677 --> 03:07:38.146
IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL. ABOUT

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:39.781
SIX BILLION COMING- SO WE THINK

03:07:39.848 --> 03:07:40.949
THAT THERE ARE BE SOME

03:07:41.016 --> 03:07:42.317
RESOURCES THAT COULD BE

03:07:42.384 --> 03:07:43.752
AVAILABLE WITHOUT I THINK OUR

03:07:43.819 --> 03:07:54.663
CONCERNS. HELLO OF THE CONCERNS

03:07:54.730 --> 03:07:56.298

03:08:03.338 --> 03:08:04.606
THAT MEAN TIMES DONE IN TIME

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:06.642
IT'S- ARE YOU JUST CONCERNS BY

03:08:06.708 --> 03:08:10.212

03:08:10.278 --> 03:08:13.749
PLACE THAT THE BIG- THAT I WE

03:08:13.815 --> 03:08:22.724
SHOULD MOST CONCERN. THAT. I AM

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:24.159
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS VERY VERY

03:08:24.226 --> 03:08:25.761
QUICKLY SO WE CAN START YOUR

03:08:25.827 --> 03:08:26.928
REQUEST ONLINE AND THEN THEY

03:08:26.995 --> 03:08:28.530
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RE OPEN FOR

03:08:28.597 --> 03:08:31.066
AWHILE UNTIL- CASES COME DOWN

03:08:31.133 --> 03:08:31.833
TO THE LEVEL THAT MIGHT BE

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.235
APPROPRIATE SO. ANOTHER REASON

03:08:33.301 --> 03:08:36.538
TO. A GIVEN. HOW MUCH CAPACITY

03:08:36.605 --> 03:08:37.739

STATE STIMULUS CHECKS AND ONE

03:08:49.851 --> 03:08:51.153
OF THE THOUGHTS THAT WE HAD

03:08:51.219 --> 03:08:53.121
ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW

03:08:53.188 --> 03:08:54.322
EARLIER IN THE SPRING THE

03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:55.824
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:56.792
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS TO

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:58.627
MOST TAXPAYERS MORE RECENTLY

03:08:58.694 --> 03:08:59.695
THERE'S ANOTHER ROUND OF SIX

03:08:59.761 --> 03:09:01.496
HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS WHICH IS

03:09:01.563 --> 03:09:03.031
THE SAME AMOUNT THAT'S GOLDEN

03:09:03.098 --> 03:09:05.434
STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL. ONE

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:07.202
GROUP OF TAXPAYERS THAT HAS

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:10.672
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THOSE- THOSE

03:09:10.739 --> 03:09:12.808
FEDERAL BENEFITS HAVE BEEN TO

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:14.776
THOSE FOLKS THAT FILE THEIR

03:09:14.843 --> 03:09:20.348
TAXES WITH I TEN- YOU KNOW-

03:09:20.415 --> 03:09:21.149
UNDER THE I. TEN PROCESS. AND

03:09:21.216 --> 03:09:24.686
SO- YOU KNOW ONE TIME WE HAD AS

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:25.821
AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO

03:09:25.887 --> 03:09:28.256
CONSIDER WOULD BE TO- PROVIDE

03:09:28.323 --> 03:09:31.293
THE STIMULUS- THE GOLDEN STATE

03:09:31.359 --> 03:09:33.328
PAYMENTS TARGETED MORE AT THOSE

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:36.631
TAXPAYERS THAT HAVE NOT- SO FAR

03:09:36.698 --> 03:09:37.232
BENEFITTED FROM THOSE FEDERAL

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:39.601
PAYMENTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW

03:09:39.668 --> 03:09:41.203
THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUSLY

03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:43.205
EXPANDED THE EITC PROGRAM IN

CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE THOSE

SOME OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS

03:09:49.811 --> 03:09:52.047
AND SO I THINK. IT'S JUST

03:09:52.114 --> 03:09:53.615
SOMETHING WE PUT FOR YOUR

03:09:53.682 --> 03:09:57.552

MAKING THIS HOMES COULD TALK

03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:18.033
ABOUT- THE MINDSET OF DOING AN

03:11:18.099 --> 03:11:22.437
INCENTIVE- GRANT BASED PROGRAM-

03:11:22.504 --> 03:11:23.805
HI I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:11:23.872 --> 03:11:25.273
TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR

03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.909
DISTRICTS TO APPLY. FOR THE

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:30.245
GRANTS AND I AM CONCERNED THAT

03:11:30.312 --> 03:11:33.882
DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T. OPENED

03:11:33.949 --> 03:11:36.184
WILL NOT GET THE GRANTS OR BOMB

03:11:36.251 --> 03:11:37.719

GRANT SO COULD YOU. COULD YOU

03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:41.656
WALK US THROUGH- WHY YOU

03:11:41.723 --> 03:11:42.958
BELIEVE THAT DISTRICTS ARE

03:11:43.024 --> 03:11:44.059
CURRENTLY CLOSE WOULD ACTUALLY

03:11:44.125 --> 03:11:46.628
BE- PERSUADED TO APPLY AND THEN

03:11:46.695 --> 03:11:50.098
ALSO TO OPEN UP BECAUSE OF

03:11:50.165 --> 03:11:51.900
THIS. FUNDING SURE I'LL JUST

03:11:51.967 --> 03:11:53.568
START AND I WILL PROBABLY PUT

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:56.438
THIS ONE TO JESSICA HOME- BUT

03:11:56.504 --> 03:11:58.440
AGAIN I THINK THE IMPORTANT.

03:11:58.506 --> 03:11:59.841
ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE THING IS

03:11:59.908 --> 03:12:01.476
TO HAVE THAT OPEN CONVERSATION

03:12:01.543 --> 03:12:02.611
TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMING THAT

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:04.212
IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:12:04.279 --> 03:12:05.113
THE NEEDS ARE AT THE LOCAL

03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:07.182
LEVEL- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:12:07.249 --> 03:12:09.618
IS- LIKE OTHER THINGS THE

03:12:09.684 --> 03:12:12.554
NEGOTIATION AND- WE ARE

03:12:12.621 --> 03:12:13.054
LISTENING AND TRYING TO

03:12:13.121 --> 03:12:15.323
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE. THOSE

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.392
NEEDS ARE AND- I THINK IT MAY

03:12:17.459 --> 03:12:18.460
BE VERY DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT%

03:12:18.526 --> 03:12:20.562
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS YOU SAY. SO

03:12:20.629 --> 03:12:22.264
JESSICA IF YOU COULD PROVIDE

03:12:22.330 --> 03:12:24.532
SOME DETAILS. THANK YOU. THANK

03:12:24.599 --> 03:12:27.802
YOU CERTAINLY- SO I WOULD I

03:12:27.869 --> 03:12:28.870
WOULD I GUESS START OF MY

03:12:28.937 --> 03:12:30.038
COMMENTS BY GENOCIDE JUST

03:12:30.105 --> 03:12:30.839
COMPOUNDS DEPARTMENT OF

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:32.574
FINANCE- I WOULD SORT OF MY

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.109
COMMENTS BY JUST. PICKING UP I

03:12:34.175 --> 03:12:35.677
THINK WHERE MISLI LEFT OFF WHEN

03:12:35.744 --> 03:12:36.678
SHE SAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO

03:12:36.745 --> 03:12:37.913
LOOK DIFFERENT FOR EVERY ALLEY

03:12:37.979 --> 03:12:40.315
I THINK THAT THAT- YOU KNOW

03:12:40.382 --> 03:12:41.249
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

03:12:41.316 --> 03:12:42.284
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE'S IN A

03:12:42.350 --> 03:12:44.352
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION- AT

03:12:44.419 --> 03:12:45.987
THIS POINT. I THINK FOR FOLKS

03:12:46.054 --> 03:12:48.623
WHO- WHO ARE ALREADY OPEN FOR

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:50.892
AN- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION-

03:12:50.959 --> 03:12:52.560
CERTAINLY THIS IS GOING TO BE

03:12:52.627 --> 03:12:55.063
HELPFUL FOR THEM- BUT FOR FOLKS

03:12:55.130 --> 03:12:56.564
WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN INDONESIA

03:12:56.631 --> 03:12:57.699
THE MAJORITY OF THESE FOLKS ARE

03:12:57.766 --> 03:12:59.467
ARE IN. COUNTIES THAT HAVE

03:12:59.534 --> 03:13:02.337
RATES THAT ARE ABOVE TWENTY

03:13:02.404 --> 03:13:03.338
EIGHT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND-

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:04.806
THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR

03:13:04.873 --> 03:13:06.041
THEM TO PARTICIPATE AS AS MR

03:13:06.107 --> 03:13:08.243
CABRAL MENTIONED. AND PART OF

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:10.545
THIS IS- PROVIDING A SET OF

03:13:10.612 --> 03:13:12.113
GUIDANCE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE

03:13:12.180 --> 03:13:13.081
MORE COME OUT PUBLICLY

03:13:13.148 --> 03:13:15.884
TOMORROW- IN LATER IN THE WEEK-

03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:16.685
ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:13:16.751 --> 03:13:21.022
GUIDANCE BUT- I'M PART. OF THE

03:13:21.089 --> 03:13:23.625
ROLLOUT OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE-

03:13:23.692 --> 03:13:24.659
IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:13:24.726 --> 03:13:26.661
THAT SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND AND

03:13:26.728 --> 03:13:27.896
COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND THAT

03:13:27.963 --> 03:13:29.497
SCHOOLS KNOW HOW TO BE SAFE.

03:13:29.564 --> 03:13:30.966
EVEN WHEN WE HAVE YOU KNOW

03:13:31.032 --> 03:13:32.667
RELATIVELY HIGH TRANSMISSION

03:13:32.734 --> 03:13:34.302
RATES. I'M PART OF THE REASON

03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:36.204
WHY AND YOU SEE THE GROUND

03:13:36.271 --> 03:13:37.639
STRUCTURE AROUND AND THE

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:38.974
YOUNGER CHILDREN IN THE COHORTS

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:40.475
IS BECAUSE WE KNOW TAT THERE

03:13:40.542 --> 03:13:41.776
ARE LOWER TRANSMISSION RATES

03:13:41.843 --> 03:13:43.478
WITH THOSE STUDENTS. WE THINK

03:13:43.545 --> 03:13:46.481
THAT- THE TIMING- IS ACTUALLY A

03:13:46.548 --> 03:13:48.350
DOABLE FOR MANY L. A.'S BECAUSE

03:13:48.416 --> 03:13:49.751
THEY'RE NOT STARTING FROM ZERO

03:13:49.818 --> 03:13:51.453
GOING INTO THIS PROCESS MANY OF

03:13:51.519 --> 03:13:52.787
THEM HAVE BEEN WORKING ON RE

03:13:52.854 --> 03:13:55.557
OPENING. SINCE LAST MARCH- AND

03:13:55.623 --> 03:13:56.491
HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH

03:13:56.558 --> 03:13:58.059
THINGS LIKE TESTING CADENCES

03:13:58.126 --> 03:13:59.427
AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:01.563
HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND HAVE

03:14:01.629 --> 03:14:03.131
BEEN- YOU KNOW. CONTINUES

03:14:03.198 --> 03:14:04.566
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR

03:14:04.632 --> 03:14:06.868
COMMUNITIES ABOUT COMING BACK-

03:14:06.935 --> 03:14:08.303
THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE

03:14:08.370 --> 03:14:09.437
TWO DIFFERENT APPLICATION DATES

03:14:09.504 --> 03:14:10.772
A FEBRUARY FIRST ST IN THE

03:14:10.839 --> 03:14:11.940
MARCH FIRST AND THAT'S BECAUSE

03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:13.208
WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR SOME

03:14:13.274 --> 03:14:14.142
ONLY IF IT'S GOING TO BE

03:14:14.209 --> 03:14:16.111
DIFFICULT. TO MEET THAT

03:14:16.177 --> 03:14:20.181
FEBRUARY FIRST DEADLINE- SO

03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:20.715
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A MARCH

03:14:20.782 --> 03:14:21.383
DEADLINE. ONCE YOU GET OUT

03:14:21.449 --> 03:14:22.951
PASSED THOSE DEADLINES I'M IT

03:14:23.018 --> 03:14:25.320
GETS MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT-

03:14:25.387 --> 03:14:27.756
ED TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL IN

03:14:27.822 --> 03:14:29.257
PERSON INSTRUCTION PROGRAM

03:14:29.324 --> 03:14:30.091
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING REALLY

03:14:30.158 --> 03:14:31.192
CLOSE TO THE END OF THE SCHOOL

03:14:31.259 --> 03:14:33.294
YEAR. AND SO WE REALLY FOCUSED

03:14:33.361 --> 03:14:35.463
ON- YOU KNOW TRYING TO UTILIZE

03:14:35.530 --> 03:14:37.232
AS MUCH OF THE REMAINING PART

03:14:37.298 --> 03:14:38.333
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT WE HAVE

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:40.101
THIS YEAR. AND REALLY TRYING TO

03:14:40.168 --> 03:14:41.603
FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP

03:14:41.669 --> 03:14:44.739
THOSE WHO- AND WHO CAN GET. YOU

03:14:44.806 --> 03:14:46.141
KNOW MAKE IT OVER THAT THAT

03:14:46.207 --> 03:14:48.043
HURDLE- TO GET TO THAT POINT.

03:14:48.109 --> 03:14:49.277
I'M TO GO BACK TO YOUR

03:14:49.344 --> 03:14:51.279
QUESTIONS ABOUT EQUITY AND HOW

03:14:51.346 --> 03:14:53.048
WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

03:14:53.114 --> 03:14:54.049
THOSE WHO ARE MOST HEAVILY

03:14:54.115 --> 03:14:56.217
IMPACTED. BY THE COPA NINETEEN

03:14:56.284 --> 03:14:57.852

IF. YOU CANNOT OPEN FOR IN

03:15:11.066 --> 03:15:12.100
PERSON BECAUSE YOUR RATES DON'T

03:15:12.167 --> 03:15:13.301
GO DOWN BEFORE THE END OF THE

03:15:13.368 --> 03:15:14.903
YEAR. THIS IS A REALLY

03:15:14.969 --> 03:15:15.804
EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY AND

03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:18.373

BUSINESSES MAY HAVE HAD THE

03:22:09.617 --> 03:22:11.853
GREATEST INCOME LOSS- SO

03:22:11.919 --> 03:22:13.521
ESPECIALLY FROM DIFFERENT ARTS

03:22:13.588 --> 03:22:14.989

HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. OPEN UP

03:22:17.291 --> 03:22:19.861
AT ALL- PERHAPS THERE'S A WAY

03:22:19.927 --> 03:22:21.262

PERCENTAGE. OF INCOME LOSS

03:22:34.075 --> 03:22:34.909
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLE

03:22:34.976 --> 03:22:36.844
TO OPEN UP. ALSO THERE'S A

03:22:36.911 --> 03:22:39.514
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE

03:22:39.580 --> 03:22:40.081

TO TIDE PEOPLE OVER FOR A MONTH

03:22:44.852 --> 03:22:46.521

WAS A PROPER EQUITY BETWEEN.

03:23:00.935 --> 03:23:02.303
THE DIFFERENT REGIONS AROUND

03:23:02.370 --> 03:23:03.771

THAT WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO IT

03:23:07.275 --> 03:23:09.110
WE JUST WANT TO SEE AS WE GET

03:23:09.176 --> 03:23:10.745
