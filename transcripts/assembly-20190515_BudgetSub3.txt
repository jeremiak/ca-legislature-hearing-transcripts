AND I WOULD TAKE NOTE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ITEM TODAY -- THAT WILL -- THAT IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD OPEN THAT CERTAINLY INCLUDES -- THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN THE ASSEMBLY WILL -- BE -- UNVEILING ITS PLAN. NEXT WEEK NEXT WEEK NEXT WEEK -- AND SO YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT -- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A A PACKED CROWD HERE TODAY WE ALSO HAVE A PACKED AGENDA SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF YOU WHO ARE GOING TO WANT TO ADD. A PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING CAP AND TRADE. IT'S GOING TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE KEEP IT VERY VERY SHORT SO THAT WE CAN. GET THROUGH OUR ENTIRE AGENDA IN TIMELY FASHION TODAY. AND WITH THAT WILL -- AS FOR THE PRESENTATION MS GORDON I UNDERSTAND THAT -- TO AFTER PRESENTING HERE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO RUN OVER TO THE SENATE. TO MAKE A PRESENTATION THERE THEY'RE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WE ARE I KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE SO. TAKE AROUND AS LONG AS YOU CAN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND PLEASE PROCEED ABSOLUTELY -- THANK YOU SO MUCH -- IN MY EXCUSE ME ASK EARTH WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO. BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN WE WON'T HAVE TO INTERRUPT YOU THIS WAY ANY FURTHER NORTH. LET'S TAKE ROLE. I AM HERE FONG [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] PATTERSON RAMOS [inaudible] THIS YEAR. AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH -- BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE UP MY NAME IS KATE GORDON I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALSO THE GOVERNOR SENIOR ADVISER ON CLIMATE. AND VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE MAYOR VISION AND ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE BUDGET ON A PROPOSAL ON THE CAP AND TRADE. EXPENDITURE PLAN JUST A COUPLE OF OPENING KIND OF FRAMING REMARKS ON THIS AS YOU ALL KNOW AND HAVE BEEN PART OF THE STATE IS MADE MAJOR PROGRESS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION OVER THE PAST DECADE. PARTICULARLY IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WE'VE SEEN JUST INCREDIBLE GAINS IN MATTER TARGETS EARLY I ELECTRICITY HOWEVER. WE'RE STILL SEEING REAL CHALLENGES IN PARTS OF THAT OUR SYSTEM WHERE EMISSIONS ARE STEADY OR THEY'RE GOING UP AND I THINK THAT. CARDS SB ONE FIFTY REPORT LAST. WINTER WAS VERY CLEAR THAT PARTICULARLY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IS ONE WHERE BECAUSE OF INCREASED DRIVING AND AND AGAIN INCREASINGLY AND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES FORCING EMISSIONS ACTUALLY RISE STEADILY YEAR BY YEAR IN THE STATE -- WE'RE ALSO SEEING EMISSIONS STAY STUDY OR RISING BOTH THE AGRICULTURE TREE AND TREE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR SO. AND OF COURSE INCREASED EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES. AT THE SAME TIME AS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO THE LEGISLATURE'S RIGHTLY FOCUS ATTENTION. ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE PARTICULARLY ON UNDERSERVED IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I THE BILLS I AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SB SIX SEVENTEEN AND OF COURSE SB NINE NO ONE ON THE FIRE IMPACTS ARE ALL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. CONTEXT FOR THE WAY THAT WE SHAPED ON THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY THAT WE PROPOSED -- A FOCUSES IN ON THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON EMISSION REDUCTION AND NEED TO DO MORE AS WELL AS THOSE WHERE. GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION DIRECTLY MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTS HUMANS PARTICULARLY IN VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. A KEY PRIORITY WAS. TO PUT -- FOCUS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS AGAIN THAT WOULDN'T AFFECT INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY. WITH THE INTERSECTION OF CLIMATE IMPACT AND PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES -- ARE REALLY SEEN AND FELT. AND ALSO AND YOU'LL SEE THIS WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT ON YOU KNOW LOOKING AHEAD AT AREAS WHERE. WE REALLY NEED TO DO MORE TO FOCUS ON THE STATE'S LONG TERM TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND HOW TO START PLANNING FOR THAT. I SHOULD SAY AND I YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY PLEASED AT THE COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE AGENCIES ON THIS BUDGET AND ALL OF MANY COLLEAGUES FROM THE AGENCIES ARE HERE AND CAN SPEAK. IN MUCH MORE DETAIL TO SPECIFIC ITEMS ALL JUST GIVE AN OVERVIEW. SO AN OVERVIEW ON ON THE FULL BUDGET OF COURSE IN JANUARY -- YOU SAW A AND CONTINUE TO SEE IN THE MIRROR VISION A STRONG FOCUS ON FIRE -- RESILIENCE FOREST MANAGEMENT AND DIE RESILIENCE AND OF COURSE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE SAW LAST YEAR ONE OF THE BIGGEST FIRE SEASONS. EVER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CLIMATE NUMBER SHOW THAT THAT WILL THOSE FIRES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN SEVERTY AND FREQUENCY SO THAT IS A STRONG THEME THAT CONTINUES THROUGH. THE MAYOR VISION. THE MAJOR AREAS OF INCREASE IN THE MAYOR VISION GO DIRECTLY TO THAT WHAT I JUST SAID ABOUT SORT OF FOCUSING IN ON THOSE AREAS WHERE EMISSIONS HAVE NOT BEEN. DROPPING AS FAST AS WE NEED TO SEE THEM -- ALSO AGAIN WHERE I WHERE THESE POLLUTION IMPACTS MOST AFFECT WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES SO I'LL GO THROUGH THOSE AT A HIGH LEVEL. I'M THE FIRST IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TRANSFER OF CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. I AS YOU KNOW -- THIS PROGRAM THIS THIS INCREASE BRINGS A PROGRAM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION WHICH IS CLOSE TO ITS ORIGINAL FUNDING LEVEL NOT QUITE THERE. THIS PROGRAM IS IS SORT OF THE AND IN SOME WAYS THE EPITOME OF WHERE CLIMATE AFFECTS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND WORK COMMUTE WHERE HUMAN IMPACTS AND CLIMATE IMPACTS INTERSECT. THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY SCALE PROJECTS MOST OF THEM BRINGING TOGETHER HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION -- AS WELL AS URBAN GREENING AND OTHER IMPORTANT CLIMATE RESILIENCE ASPECT INTO VERY SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES WITH A FOCUS ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE PROGRAM TARGETS THE TOP 5% OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ARE THERE IS A SPECIFIC FOCUS IN THE PROGRAM AND MOST OF THE PROJECTS REFLECT THIS ON THAT. WRITTEN TO REDUCTION OF DRIVING REDUCTION VMT THROUGH PROJECTS THAT INCORPORATE MOBILITY OPTIONS INCLUDING WALKING BIKING TRANSIT BUT ALSO A FOCUS ON AGAIN GREEN SPACES AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON THE PROJECTS WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT. UNIQUE -- THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES -- AYE AYE STRONG FOCUS ON DECREASING POLLUTION AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY FROM I TRY AGAIN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE REAL GAINS BUT ALSO IN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE. THE BUDGET FOCUSES ON POLLUTION DIESEL POLLUTION REDUCTION IN THREE PLACES. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR CLEAN TRUCKS AND BUSES IN OFF ROAD VEHICLE TRANSFORMATION FIFTEEN MILLION INCREASE FOR THE ENHANCED WITH THE FOREHAND SO ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION PROGRAM SKEWS ME. AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION INCREASE FOR ENGINE UPGRADES A REPLACEMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES LL OF THESE PROGRAMS REALLY GO STRAIGHT TO THE QUESTION OF HOW DOES THIS HOW DOES POLLUTION FROM THE SECTORS WHERE WE ARE NOT MAKING AS AS QUICK GAINES. AFFECT PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE I WANTED TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE ENHANCE WE ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. THERE'S BEEN AS YOU ALL KNOW AND CONTINUES TO BE A STRONG FOCUS AND STILL IS A FOCUS IN THE BUDGET ON ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND IT'S OF COURSE A HUGE PRIORITY FOR THE STATE IN FRONT ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION PROGRAM I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT. STEP STONE TOWARD THAT IT'S A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS PARTICULARLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO RETIRE AND REPLACE VEHICLES CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY SIX MILLION LIKE TO THE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TO AT LEAST TWO MILLION OF THOSE ARE OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD. THAT'S A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR SMOG PROBLEM AND MOST OF THOSE ARE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS AND HELPS PEOPLE REPLACE THOSE OLDER VEHICLES WITH NEWER AND IDEALLY THERE'S A KICKER FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE SO I THINK IT'S A PARTICULAR IMPORTANT PROGRAM -- WE THINK TO SUPPORT. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR I SAID EARLIER ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE HAVE MADE. LIMITED GAINES GOOD GAINS BUT THE EMISSIONS LEVELS ARE STAYING FAIRLY FLAT IT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA PROVIDING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO THE ECONOMY AS YOU KNOW AND PARTICULARLY CRITICAL IN KEY. AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES WE FOCUS HERE ON PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE YOU WILL BENEFITS FOR THE SECTOR ITSELF TO STRENGTHEN THE SECTOR. AND STRENGTHEN CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE AND ALSO REDUCE ON EMISSIONS SAYS SPECIFICALLY A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH HAS THE DOUBLE BENEFIT OF HELPING TO SEQUESTER MORE CARBON UNDERGROUND WHICH IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS OVER THE LONG TERM. AND ALSO A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM METHANE OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE MOST POTENT. GREENHOUSE GASES ON IN IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION TO THESE TARGETED INCREASES IN KEY PROGRAMS THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZING INVESTMENT IN THE OVERALL TRANSITION OF THE STATE. TO A CARBON NEUTRAL NEUTRAL ECONOMY AND THESE DIRECT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PROVIDING WORKFORCE TRAINING AND HIGHER TRAIN PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY JOBS ACROSS ALL THE AREAS OF INVESTMENT. I SHOULD SAY AND AND TEN RAINY FROM THE WORK FOR STILL MEMBERS HERE TO TALK MORE THIS BECAUSE WE'RE SURE YOU'LL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. WE SHOULD SAY THAT WE KNOW FROM THEIR RESEARCH AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH THAT THE MAJORITY OF JOBS CREATED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND INVESTMENTS OVERALL ARE IN CONSTRUCTION. AND CONSTRUCTION CAREERS ARE CHANGING AS WERE ASKING FOR CLEANER BUILDINGS GREENER BUILDINGS TO CARBONIZED BUILDINGS EFFICIENT BUILDINGS WERE ASKING FOR NEW SKILLS AND WE'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS. WE KNOW FROM YEARS OF STUDY THAT IF WORKERS IN THOSE FIELDS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A LIGHT LABOR SHORTAGE IN THOSE FIELDS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TRAINING AND SOME OF THESE GREEN BUILDING. STANDARDS WE ALSO KNOW THAT WORKERS IN THOSE FIELDS WHEN NOT PROPERLY TRAINED AREN'T REALIZING THOSE GAINS ENERGY EFFICIENCY GAINS ARE LOST. THROUGH ON INEFFECTIVE OPERATION MAINTENANCE AND SO WE REALLY THINK THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION HERE. BUT ALSO JUST A LONG TERM NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE MAY REVISION I INCREASE IN THAT BUDGET SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. TO THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDING ON DEPENDING ON FOSSIL FUELS THOSE COUNTIES ARE KERN COUNTY WE CALLED OUT IT IS THE NUMBER ONE COUNTY -- FOR OIL AND GAS BY FAR IN THE STATE WE CALLED IT OUT BECAUSE KERN COUNTY IS ALREADY SEEN JOB DECLINES THROUGH AUTOMATION. AND GLOBALIZATION ANOTHER MARKET FORCES WERE OUT THERE ALSO GOING TO SEE AND THE INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE IS THIS LONG TERM. NEED FOR DIVERSIFICATION IN THAT INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF JUST POLICIES LIKE THESE SO WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO THAT. IN THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION. THE BUDGET INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND THOSE ARE ONE OF THE KEY. I KEEP VEHICLES BRINGING TOGETHER EMPLOYERS WORKERS ECONOMIC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND STAKEHOLDERS TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL TO RELEASE SEE WHERE THOSE TRANSITIONS ARE HAPPENING AND HOW WE NEED TO BETTER TRAINED. FOR THE JOBS THAT ARE EMERGING IN THE NEW CARBON YOU TROLL ECONOMY. YOU'LL ALSO SEE IN THE MIRROR VISION SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET WHICH IS A AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR STUDY TO PROVIDE A ROADMAP. OF HOW TO DO THAT TRANSITION OR CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY. TWENTY FIFTY THAT ROAD MAP WILL INCLUDE AND THIS IS NEW FOR I THINK THE STATE BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS HOW DO WE LOOK AT HOW TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS. AND OUR AND GET FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY WILL ALSO CONSIDER HOW THE STATE WILL MANAGE THAT DECLINE THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE JOBS THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING TODAY. AGAIN THROUGH AUTOMATION AND THROUGH MARKET FORCES OTHER STATES ARE SURPASSING US AND WE'LL GAS PRODUCTION. BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE OF POLICY CHANGES ACROSS THE GLOBE. SO THAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL -- ON THE MAYOR VISION THE GENDER BUDGET IN THE MAYOR VISION AND I WILL -- LEAVE IT TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS AND I MAY CALL ON COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCIES ON ON ON SPECIFIC POINTS ARE FROM FINANCE. GREAT WELL WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM -- L. L. S. RAMP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT ON JUST SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND THE NAY REVISION AROUND REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONIES ALLOCATED. SO THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN REVENUE OVER FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO -- UNDER CURRENT LAW 60% OF THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED A CERTAIN PROGRAM SINCE THAT LEAVES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE. UP BEYOND WHAT THEIR ESTIMATED IN JANUARY AND SO OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ALLOCATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT. THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED RIGHT NOW -- JUST ON THE REVENUE ESTIMATES IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THEIR ESTIMATES ARE ARE REASONABLE AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THEIRS -- ONE SMALL DIFFERENCE WE HAVE IS -- AN ESTIMATE ON REVENUE ON THE NAY AUCTION WHICH ACTUALLY JUST OCCURRED YESTERDAY WE WON'T KNOW THE RESULTS OF THAT AUCTION OR THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS UNTIL NEXT WEEK SOMETIME. BUT WE DO EXPECT THE REVENUE WILL LIKELY BE A SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATED WE ESTIMATE ABOUT. A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER BASED ON CURRENT PRICES FOR ALLOWANCES THAT WOULD LEAVE AGAIN TAKING OUT THE 60% CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. MORE A POTENTIALLY ONCE WE SEE THE RESULTS ABOUT OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ALLOCATING EITHER IN THIS BUDGET OR IN FUTURE BUDGETS -- AND SO WHAT WILL UPDATE THE LEGISLATURE ONCE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. ON THAT PARTICULAR ALLOCATIONS I THINK AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE -- REALLY IT MOSTLY COMES DOWN TO THE ADMINISTRATION OR EXCUSE ME THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES ON HOW IT PRIORITIZE IS DIFFERENT BENEFITS THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION. PRIORITIZING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS -- AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS BOTH ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE. AS WELL AS THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION SIDE OF THINGS BUT THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER PROGRAMS OF COURSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ALLOCATE IN THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FUND INTO. A DEPENDING ON WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES PRIORITIES ARE WHETHER THAT BE ADAPTATION -- RESEARCH SHORE OR OTHER THINGS SO -- I'LL IN MY COMMENTS THERE. THANK YOU A DEPARTMENT FINANCE NO REPORT -- ANY QUESTIONS MS GARCIA. I THANK YOU AND SO WITH THE LA -- MENTIONED LOCAL ERROR WHEN WE DID. CAP AND TRADE WEEK WE THIS CONTINUES THE DISCUSS CLEAN AIR WITH A CONTINUES TO DISCUSS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- AND WE CAN TO LEASES BECAUSE MARRYING THESE ISSUES AND WE AND AND THAT -- BUT THEY BE SIX SEVENTEEN ALONG THE WAY WE HAVE THE FIRST SET OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING ACTION PLANS AND WE HAVE. DOLLARS ASIDE THEIR LATER THIS YEAR WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SELECTING A SECOND SET OF COMMUNITIES -- BUT I SEE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANY INCREASE YOUR FOR COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS ARE FOR THAT WORK UNTIL WONDERING IF THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LOOKED INTO OUR WHY THE CHOICES NOT TO AUGMENT THAT. THAT BUDGET. THERE'S PROBABLY SOMEONE FROM AIR BE HERE WHO CAN SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THAT BUILT BY THE WAITT WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THAT PROGRAM AND WE WERE. GIVEN THE EIGHT WE WERE INFORMED BY I AIR BE THAT ESSENTIALLY TWO HUNDRED WAS WAS THE MAXIMUM THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND ON THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. GIVEN ALL KINDS OF THINGS CAPACITY TIME LINES -- DEADLINES ETCETERA SO WE ACTUALLY LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AND INCREASES THEIR AND WORK. TALK THROUGH IT AND WERE GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT AN INCREASE AT THIS TIME WOULDN'T ACTUALLY CREATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND SO THEN MY SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION OR MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT AT THIS POINT. IS. AS WE ADD MORE THINGS INTO HOW WE SPLIT UP OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS WE SET UP CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS WHILE IT MIGHT BE A ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS PEOPLE START TO BELIEVE THAT THESE MIGHT BE CONTINUOUS. AND IT'S HARDER TO TAKE IT AWAY LATER ON AND TO GIVE IT INTO KNOWING THAT MAYBE AT THIS POINT THE AIR BE IF I CAPACITY BUT THESE TEN COMMUNITIES ARE COMING UP. WE HAVE AT LEAST TEN COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS WE DIVVY UP THE MONEY OR LIKE IN ABOUT TWENTY MILLION PER ACTION PLAN WHICH THE REALITY MEANS THAT. ONE YEAR'S NOT GONNA COMPLETE THAT ACTION PLAN THERE WILL BE MORE MANY NEED EFFORTLESS ACTION PLANS PLUS THE TEN YOU COMMUNITIES THAT COME IN LATER IN THE YEAR AND AND SO FORTH AND SO. I ARE WE CONSIDERING YOU SEEN GENERAL FUND FOR SOME OF THESE THINGS -- WE HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS IN HERE RIGHT TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST ISSUES IN MY BACKYARD -- TRANSFORMATIVE CAN A COMMUNITY -- IS ANOTHER VERY PREGNANT SO BOTH HAVE WE CONSIDERED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE EXTRA DOLLARS IN OUR GENERAL FUND AND DOING DOING SOME OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE WORK AND SEWER CLEANER WORK AND PAYING FOR IT. FROM GENERAL FUND THIS WELL I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK WE EXPECTED COMEDY A TEACHER R. F.. TO BE THE ONLY SOURCE FOR THESE DOLLARS IN OUR ONLY SOLUTION AND IT'S A LOT OF ENOUGH MONEY BE ASKED ME AND I WILL I LIVE FINANCE ENTER IF THEY IF THEY LIKE TO GO TO THAT THE ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THIS POINT OF INTEGRATING CLIMATE GOALS PARTICULARLY AROUND RESILIENCE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN TWO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DON'T SHOW UP HERE IN THE JEEP CHEROKEE IT'S NOT THE ONLY PART OF MONEY. THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES SO IF YOU LOOK AT THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET THAT THE HOUSING PRIORITIES FOR INSTANCE IN THE FOCUS ON INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS A AS A AS A STRATEGY TO BRING DOWN VEHICLE EMISSIONS THROUGH HOUSING THERE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT AS WELL SO I WILL I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD BE REFLECTING THESE PRIORITIES. THE OTHER POINT IS THAT EACH OF THESE TO YOUR DESERVES COMMUNITIES POINT. EACH OF THESE OTHER PRIORITIES -- I THINK THERE IS A STRONG FOCUS ON ON EQUITY WERE ON THE TRANSFER OF CLIMATE COMMITTEES PROGRAM THE ENHANCE FLEET BIT MODERNIZATION PROGRAM AND DIESEL. POLLUTION GENERALLY ALL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS COMMUNITY SO WE WOULD SAY THAT THE SIX SEVENTEEN IS A BIG PIECE OF THAT AND PARTICULARLY WHERE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMES IN. BUT THAT THAT'S A THEME THROUGHOUT THESE INCREASES. DID YOU PRESS ONE OF AN AND AND THEN JUST TO REITERATE THE POINT WHETHER IT'S AB SIX SEVENTEEN OR OTHER WAYS YOU'RE GIVING UP MONIES. YOU MENTIONED HOW WERE NOT GETTING THE MISSIONS THAT WE WOULD HOLE FOR RIGHT IN AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE AG SECTOR AND WE'VE BEEN PRETTY GENEROUS OVER THE YEARS AND THE SAME QUESTION HAS COME UP WITH AB SIX SEVENTEEN OF WHAT ARE WE PUTTING IN PLACE NOW. TO MAKE SURE WE ARE TRACKING RESULT IN ARE WE INVESTING THE MONEY THE BEST WAYS HOW ARE IF OUR EARLY INVESTMENTS HAVING GIVEN AS THE VESSEL SHOULD WE KEEP PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE SAME PROGRAMS. ARE SURELY BE YOU KNOW THINKING ALONG THE WAY AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE CONCERNS NOT JUST WITH -- WITH. YOU KNOW WITH THE AG INDUSTRY BUT ALSO WITH AND EVEN THE A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN WORK I WAS JUST TRYING MONEY RANDOMLY THIS ANY ABOUT WORKING OR NOT AND WHAT ARE WE DOING. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LEARNING AND ADJUSTING ALONG THE WAY PART OF IT IS THAT A LOT IS NEW RIGHT WE'RE HAVING TO LEARN ALONG THE WAY BUT ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE STOPPING A REFLECTING ON THOSE LESSONS ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I THINK THAT THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT WAS ACTUALLY VERY HELPFUL IN SORT OF CALLING THE QUESTION ON SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND REALLY POINTED TO THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE. I WOULD SAY THAT I'M IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR SPECIFICALLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO SHOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE SALT AND MAPPING PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR ARE VERY GOOD INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF GHG REDUCTION FOR THE MONEY. ON THESE ARE SECTORS THAT ARE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS THAT ARE GROWING AND SO THERE IS THAT TENSION AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT THAT BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WERE LOOKING AT THAT LONG TO STUDY TO REALLY SAY WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY. CARBON NEUTRALITY AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GET THERE WHAT'S THE LONG VIEW. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS GOMEZ REST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I FIRST WANT TO APPLAUD THE ADDITIONAL. MONIES INCREASING MONIES IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE -- CLIENT COMMUNITIES. MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY MORE COMMUNITIES. CAN BE IDENTIFIED. TO HELP -- THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS NEW FUNDING. WILL WE WANNA. LEASE BEDS WERE THROUGH RUNS A PROGRAM IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP AND GOOD MORNING I'M LOUISE BEDWORTH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL -- WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- WITH AT THE TCC PROGRAM WE LOOK TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT BETWEEN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. JUST THEM OUT WE VIEW TO NECESSARY TO MAKE TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITY SO WITH THE AMOUNT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET WE CAN PROBABLY. SERVE ABOUT FOUR COMMUNITIES -- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN MAKING INVESTMENTS IN PLANNING GRANTS. AND HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PLANNING GRANTS -- TO GET READY FOR ACCESSING A NUMBER OF FUNDING PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE TCC PROGRAM. IS THAT LIST OF THE THE COMMITTEES ARE WORKING WITH IS NOT AVAILABLE. YES I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OKAY NOT ON THIS OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. THANK YOU I TIME. OR DID YOU HAVE MORE STORY. AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO MS RIVAS THE THE FIFTY FIFTY MILLION INCREASE FOR THE CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. IN SOME PLACES IT WAS ZERO EMISSION SOME PLACES I UNDERSTAND IT'S NEAR ZERO IS THIS ZERO EMISSION. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AIR BE QUESTION. HERE. WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY PROGRAM IT TURNS OUT. TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE. HI THIS IS ANDY KANSEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WE DO HAVE ANOTHER CHAIR OVER HERE OKAY SOMEBODY ONCE -- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BROWN. OR CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS FUNDING DOES GO TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES -- ZERO MISSION OF THE BATTERY ELECTRIC IN FUEL CELL ALSO -- LOW KNOCKS -- INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES AND HYBRID EQUIPMENT HYBRID VEHICLE SO IT IT REALLY IS A COMBINATION OF THOSE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AND THE FUNDING WHICH WOULD BE DIRECTED. TO OUR CLEAN TALK ABOUT VOUCHER PROGRAM WHICH FUNDS AS TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS TRANSFORM THE FREIGHT PROJECTS. IS THIS A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE PROGRAMS OF ALL. NO THIS IS -- IT DID THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWING US TO CONTAIN IT SPEND THESE PROGRAMS TO MEET THE DEAD. DEMAND THAT'S THE TO COMING IN BECAUSE IN THE END WE WANT TO BE ZERO EMISSION. HOW IS THAT HOW IS IT GOING TO BE DIVIDED UP -- SO. ZERO MISSION IS NOT -- THERE FOR ALL OF YOU KNOW FOR ALL POLL. OPERATIONS IN VEHICLE CLASSES SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF HERE. FOR WORK -- IT IS FOR FUNDING FOR COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES IN SOME CASES IT'S ZERO MISSION IN SOME CASES IT'S HYBRID IN SOME CASES IT'S LOW KNOCKS. AND THEN WE DO A DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO TRY AND BRING CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES TAUGHT. TO MARKET SO THAT WE CAN -- BRING ZERO MISSION TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET IN AREAS WHERE IT'S NOT. NOT CURRENTLY OTHER COMMERCIAL STAGE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MY LAST QUESTION STRUCTURE. WHEN YOU DESCRIBE TO THE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PROGRESS? WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AG INDUSTRY SAID THAT IT WAS STAYING STUDY? YOU TALKED ABOUT -- INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIAL YOU TALKED ABOUT -- TRANSPORTATION. YOU SAID WAS GETTING WORSE. AND YEAH OUT. FOR AG WE HAVE SIXTY FIVE MILLION. FOR AGRICULTURE DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND METHANE REDUCTION TEN MILLION MORE. AND I GO BACK TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. FOR A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN THERE'S NO INCREASE AND I HEAR YOUR I I HEARD YOUR RESPONSE. AND FOR THE CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD. VEHICLES. FIFTY MILLION THERE SEEMS TO BE. IF WE'RE SAYING THAT ADDRESS IS BETTER. THEN THE OTHERS YET WE'RE SPENDING SO MUCH MORE TIME ON AG. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY AG COLLEAGUES. IT MAY BE THAT SOMEBODY FROM CDFA WANTS TO SPEAK MORE TO THIS I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE AG VEHICLE PROGRAM DIESEL REDUCTION PROGRAM IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND AGRICULTURE. SO IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY SORT OF ALMOST AT THE INTERSECTION TRANSPORTATION AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VEHICLES THAT ARE IN IT VIEW BEING USED IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR BUT THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING. TO DIESEL AIR POLLUTION IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A IT'S AN INTERSECTION OF THOSE TWO THINGS WHICH IS WHY. IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THESE ARE ALSO -- VEHICLES THAT ARE -- ARE ARE USED EVERY DAY THEY'RE USED A LOT OF HOT WEATHER THERE USED IN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE AIR. POLLUTION STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE FOR A LONG TIME DOESN'T BLOW AWAY SO THERE'S A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN LOWERING POLLUTION. IN THOSE AREAS -- SO THAT'S THE ONE KEY WAY TO DO IT. WELCOME TO MY AREA THAT'S YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE DOES STAY THERE. BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE THE AG BUT WE DO HAVE IS A LOT OF WE'RE WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THE THE THE TRANSPORTATION -- THAT COMES FROM THE PORTS INTO THE WAREHOUSES -- AND IT'S ALL THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS WERE IN A VALLEY AND IT ALL STAYS THERE SO WE GET EVERYTHING FROM LOS ANGELES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY LA PEOPLE -- BUT IT ALL COMES FROM LA AND THEN ALSO THOSE TRUCKS FOR THE PORTS AND THAT'S AB WE WANT THE INDUSTRY BUT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT RIGHT HARM TO OUR PEOPLE. THAT'S EXACTLY I MEAN I I GREW AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS WHY THE JANUARY BUDGET STARTED THE CLEAN TRUCKS DIESEL NUMBER SO MUCH HIGHER THAN THE AYE NUMBER AND THE NUMBR STILL COMES OUT AT ONE EIGHTY TWO VERSUS -- FINAL NUMBER OF NINETY IN THE AG SECTOR SO ABSOLUTELY BOTH OF THOSE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THESE PARTS OF THE DEEPLY AND ON THEIR EMPIRE AND CENTRAL VALLEY. OF BOTH OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE GROWING. THERE'S A LOT OF VEHICLES THERE'S A LOT OF POLLUTION FROM THE VEHICLE SO BOTH ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS BOTH THE JANUARY AND THE MAY BUDGET WHERE THAT COMES OUT. AT NIGHT AND IT'S STILL I WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS IT IS STILL OF CONCERN. THAT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE VERY SPECIFICALLY -- THAT WE WE DO WE DO. WE ARE RECEIVING SO MUCH MORE. OF WHAT WE DON'T WANT AND FINDING WAYS TO TO TAKE CARE OF OF THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO TO THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. AND MS GARCIA THE JOB SOMETHING HONEST TO GOD JUST ON THIS -- THAT THE TRUCKS START AT THE PORT AND HAD THROUGH MY DISTRICT AND HEAD OVER TO MISS RAY IS AND AS WE'VE SEEN ALL IS YOUR HOUSE POPPING UP. A LOT OF THEM IN HER AREA -- NOT AT ALL ANY AG IN MY AREA BUT 5% WAS POLLUTED AIR ALSO IT'S THE THIRD BETWEEN THE THE FREEWAYS IN THE RAILYARDS. AND WE'RE SEEING THIS ROTH AND WE'RE HAPPY FOR ITS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY BUT IT'S IMPACTING IS REALLY ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES AND SO THE STRUCK ISSUES ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. AS WE SEE THE CONNECTION THERE. THANK YOU THINK [inaudible] MS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU KNOW I WAS DISAPPOINTED -- TO NOT SEAT FUNDING FOR GREEN SPACES -- AND I KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE AND IN OTHER HEARINGS -- THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR THAT YOU KNOW I THINK OUR LOW ESPECIALLY OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES NEED MORE PARKS AND TREES -- URBAN FORESTRY SO DOES THIS MY MISSING SOMETHING OR DOES THIS PROPOSAL. REINSTATE THAT FUNDING SO UGH THROUGH MAYBE NOT IN THE LINE YOU'RE USED TO SEEING IT -- THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM DOES HAVE A FOCUS ON URBAN ON GREENING AS PART OF ITS PROJECT SO THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THAT FOCUSES THAT INCREASE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH. TO COMMUNITY SKILL DEVELOPMENT IN MOST IS ADVANCE COMMIT THE MOST AS A BENCH COMMITTEES OF THE STATE WITH THAT COMBINATION OF HOUSING AND DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT AND WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS. COMBINATION OF HOUSING TRANSPORTATION GREEN SPACES AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THAT INCORPORATED. SO AS PART OF A MORE INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT. OKAY BUT BEFORE IT WAS MORE AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMMUNITIES REGARDLESS IF THEY QUALIFY THAT. FOR THAT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES RIGHT WHICH IS. A BIG. PROJECT -- BIG. SO THAT THAT'S JUST MIGHT NOT IT MIGHT TAKE HER IN FOR SURE. LILY I JUST. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THAT I THINK IT'S DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT'LL AYE AYE IT YOU KNOW MY COMMUNITY -- IS THE RECIPIENT OF A T. C. C. GRANTS AND VERY EXCITED -- AND PROCLAIM A BUT I'M COMMUNITIES LIKE IT THAT DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY -- YOU KNOW TO APPLY FOR THAT BIG GRANT -- I THINK WE'RE MISSING THEM. IN TERMS OF GREEN SPACE ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THANK YOU SO THE THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM THAT'S NOT FUNDED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT IS SOMEHOW. A CAREER TESTIMONY INCORPORATED INTO THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMB THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THE THE TCC. AS YOU STATED IS FOCUSED ON FOR COMMUNITIES HOUSE -- AND I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH ON THIS AND ALSO -- URBAN FORESTRY AND WETLANDS IS -- IS LEFT OUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST KIND OF THE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA COME BACK WITH OUR PROPOSAL -- BUT WHAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON THIS NO ABSOLUTELY AND I SHOULD CLARIFY I'M BY NO MEANS SAYING THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE INCORPORATED INTO DCC I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU SEE SEE HAS. AN URBAN GREEN COMPONENT SO THERE IS A COMPONENT SO ENOUGH WORK AND IN MEAN INTERRUPTED BUT AS FOR COMMUNITY YES THERE WOULD BE SUMMER BEEN GREEN IN HIS ONE ARE THE PRIORITY EXACTLY IT'S ONE OF THE PRIORITY ELEMENTS OF THOSE PROJECTS SO THAT I WAS MERELY SAYING THAT THAT. IS AN ELEMENT THAT'S INCORPORATED ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT TCC IS THAT IT. THE CORPORATE TO MANY OF THESE THINGS INTO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS -- PLACE BASED INVESTMENT WITH LOTS OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO GOOD RIGHT ABOUT THE OTHER TWO CATEGORIES HOWEVER. THE BEG THE QUESTION WHY WHY NOT -- URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY AND AND WETLANDS FUNDING. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION NO I THINK IN THE JANUARY BUDGET THERE WAS A REAL INTENT AND IT GOES TO SOMETHING SAID EARLIER. TO TRY TO FOCUS MORE DOLLARS ON FEWER THINGS AND CHOICES WERE MADE AROUND AGAIN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE'RE REALLY NOT SEEING THE EMISSIONS IT REACTIONS AS QUICKLY AS WE NEED TO SEE THEM. AND WHERE THOSE THERE'S THOSE KIND OF IMMEDIATE POLLUTION IMPACTS. WHAT DID NOT MAKE IT INTO THE JANUARY BUDGET YOU SEE THE MAY REVISE REALLY INCREASES THINGS THAT WERE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET? AND SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO ANSWER I SPECIFICALLY FOR ME AT LEAST WHAT EXACTLY MADE IT AND IT DIDN'T BUT I WILL SAY THERE'S A STRONG FOCUS ON JUST. NARROWING AND I USING DOLLARS IS ABOUT PLEASE POSSIBLE -- THE THE LA -- ESTIMATES -- ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN CAP AND TRADE FUNDING THAN THE ADMINISTRATION. OF WE HAD AN AUCTION YESTERDAY I THINK SOME OF THE LA OWES. MOST OF THE LA OWES -- ANALYSIS WAS PREDICATED ON A DIFFERENT DATA. SAID METRICS FOR YESTERDAY'S AUCTION DO WE HAVE ANY -- INITIAL DATA ON YESTERDAY'S AUCTION -- OF FOR EXAMPLE -- WE'RE ALL THE CREDITS SOLD WHAT WE KNOW NOT THAT I KNOW OF IS -- INTERVIEW DO WE HAVE. THAT. UP THE COMING UP THEY HAVE THE DETAILS. THEY USUALLY DO IF. I'M ACTUALLY AT CHIANG AS DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE NO DETAILS. SO AS AS THE LA -- MENTIONED WE DID HAVE AN AUCTION YESTERDAY WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. THE OPTION WINDOW OPENS AND THE OPTION WHEN HOW CLOSE SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS WE HAD A SUCCESSFUL AUCTION WE ANNOUNCE AUCTION RESULTS IT'LL BE EARLY NEXT WEEK AND SO THAT IS WHEN ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. THERE'S NO INITIAL METRICS RIGHT NOW EVEN THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY -- WERE SOLD RIGHT I DON'T KNOW I ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW SO ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. AND SO I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THAT INFORMATION WE GO THROUGH A PROCESS BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE AUCTION IN THE TIME IT'S ANNOUNCED. WHERE -- WE VERIFY THAT ALL THE PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED THE MARKET MONITOR THE INDEPENDENT MARKET MONITOR THAT WE HAVE GOES THROUGH THE AUCTION TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS DONE PROPERLY. SO THERE'S A GAP AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS BEFORE THAT RESULTS ARE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED AND AND THE OFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT A DATE CERTAIN OR IS THAT IT IS AND I THINK I'M TRYING. TO IT'S USUALLY LIKE THREE DAYS OR FOUR DAYS AFTER THE AUCTION I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY BE THIS MONDAY CERTAIN GODDESS. IT'S I THINK IT'S MONDAY OR TUESDAY I CAN LOOK I CAN LOOK IT UP BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY I THINK IT IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE BUT I DON'T HAVE IT OFF THE TOP WE HAVE YEAH I MEAN AT AN SORRY. MR CHAIRMAN -- MOST OF THE TIME I THINK IT'S A A WEEK AFTER THE AUCTION OCCURS USUALLY AROUND NOON KIND OF THE YOU KNOW THE NEXT WEEK ON THE SAME DAY. SO -- PERHAPS TUESDAY OBJECTIVE DATA NOON I THINK BETWEEN OUR LOOK IS SCHEDULED MEETINGS FOR NEXT WEEK THERE YOU GO.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT JENNIFER APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY IT'S SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE SETON. THAT CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY REMAINS TROUBLED BY ANY PROPOSALS TO FUND DERRY DIE JESTERS AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES LACK CLARITY ON THIS FRONT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTER TO NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GIVE US AND REST FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE URBAN GREENING IN URBAN FORESTRY. THOSE -- PROJECTS ARE PROBABLY OUR BEST INVESTMENT IN INTERVENTION TO PREPARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOR HEATING FLOODING. AND WHILE TORNADOES AND HURRICANES GET THE HEADLINES HEATING FLOODING ARE THE DEADLIEST WEATHER RELATED EVENTS IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT THE TCC PROVIDES AN URBAN GREENING COMPONENT THAT'S TRUE BUT GETTING AT TCC PROJECT IS LIKE WINNING THE NBA LOTTERY I MEAN YOU GET. MAYBE FOR PROJECTS THE FIRST GERMAN GREENING GRANTS ONE OUT TO THIRTY NINE COMMUNITIES WE NEED AS MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES PREPARED FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS COMING AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS VERY URGENT SOUL IN MY OPINION A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND URGE THAT WE RESTORE INVESTMENTS TO THESE PROGRAMS. HELLO PERSONAL CLOSE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP CANCEL NATIONAL SEARCH A COUNCIL -- AND STOP PLACES ALWAYS ASSOCIATION NORTH AMERICA HAD EXPRESSED OUR DISAPPONTMENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOT FOR AN INCREASE. OUR CYCLE FUNDING -- WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO LEASE ALLOCATE. HUNDRED MILLION FOR FROM G. G. R. F.

DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM AND URGED ME TO PROVIDE. FIFTY MILLION CALIFORNICUM THE FORESTRY FUNDS ARE USEFUL FOR CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND OTHER MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE STATE BECAUSE THEY LOVE FOR EARLY TREE MAINTENANCE INVENTORY PROGRAMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN FORESTRY. MAGIC PLANS THESE INVESTMENTS ARE NECESSARY FOR CITIES TO PROACTIVELY MANAGE THEIR URBAN FORCED TO A STORE CARBON SAVE ENERGY AND PROTECT RESIDENTS. AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES FOR THIS REASON WE ARE SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU. REBEKAH MARCUS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CLIMATE IN AGRICULTURE NETWORK AND THE CARBON CYCLE INSTITUTE WE ARE PLEASED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PASSION FOR THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM AND SUPPORT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO THE PROGRAM AND THE MAY REVISION. IN ADDITION WE ARE SUPPORTING A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHY SOILS INITIATIVE ASK FOR FORTY MILLION LIGHT ITEM FOR THE ALTERNATIVE ANYWHERE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE RECESS ACT HOW RECYCLE ORGANIC DIVERSION PROGRAM. WE ALSO SUPPORT FORTY MILLION FOR THE STATE WATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN ZEROED OUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU. JOHN KENNEDY WITH WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED FUNDING FOR HEALTHY FORESTS AND WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION PROJECT -- AND WE'RE ALSO HERE TO REITERATE OUR SUPPORT FOR HUNDRED MILLION FOR ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING WITH SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN COMPLIANCE COSTS. TO MEET THE AMBITIOUS ORGANIC RECYCLING MANDATES SO THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIR -- COUPLE ISSUES -- COUPLE DIFFERENT CLIENTS TODAY FIRST ON THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM ON BEHALF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CRITICAL PROGRAM AND MEETING OURS HAVE GOALS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO ECHO MISTER KENNEDY'S COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- ALLOCATION TO CAL RECYCLE FOR THE WASTE DIVERSION PROGRAM FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT. AND THEN LAST -- FOR METHANE REDUCTION AND THE AG DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT UPGRADE PROGRAMS -- WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF THE MILK PRODUCERS COUNCIL -- IN THAT PROGRAM AND ONE ASSOCIATE OURSELVES ON THE METHANE PROGRAM WITH COMMENTS THAT MR BROKEN DOOR WAS ABOUT TO MAKE. THANK YOU MICHAEL BOCA DOOR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S INCREASING THE DERRY METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM. I THINK IT NEEDS TO GO FURTHER AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS ABOUT -- THE FALSE PROMISE OF THE DIGEST ARE PROGRAMS THAT WERE MADE BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO ME BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE FACTS ON THE RECORD. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE PROGRAM OF ALL THE CLINTON INVESTMENT PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF OVERALL. GHG REDUCTION IT'S THE SECOND MOST COST EFFECTIVE REDUCING A TON OF METHANE FOR EVERY EIGHT DOLLARS INVESTED. BY THE STATE. AND YOU CAN MAKE THE SIMPLE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS THE BEST INVESTMENT THE STATE IS MAKING. I ALSO WANT -- TO SUPPORT THE COMMENTS FROM THE SCORTON. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM AND TRANSPORTATION AND THE TRUCKS THAT ARE ENDING UP IN MISS RACES DISTRICT THAT GO TO MISS GARCIA'S DISTRICT AND THE PORT. THESE ARE THE VERY TRUCKS THE DERRY DIE JUST A PROGRAM IS NOW MAKING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WHICH WILL GO INTO HEAVY DUTY FREIGHT TO REPLACE DIESEL. IN DOING SO WE'RE MAKING FIFTY MILLION D. G. E. EQUIVALENT WHEN ALL THESE PROJECTS GET IMPLEMENTED. THAT WILL LEAD TO A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION OF KNOX AND SOUTH COAST IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHEN THAT ISUSED TO REPLACE DIESEL TRUCKS. SO IT HAS TREMENDOUS BENEFITS ACROSS THE BOARD IT ALSO BENEFITS WATER QUALITY IT WAS SAID THEY DO NOT. EVERY PROJECT THAT IS FUNDED BY CDFA MUST LINE THE LAGOON ON THE DAIRY SO WE'RE GETTING SUBSTANTIAL WATER QUALITY BENEFITS FROM THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. SO I JUST IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BENEFITS WE SUGGEST YOU READ THE REPORT DONE BY A R. B. AND FINANCE IT'S VERY THOROUGH IT SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE BEST INVESTMENT THE STATE'S MAKING THANK YOU. THE MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MAY SLOW THE CIVIC FOREST TRUST BATTING CLEANUP -- ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALSO. AGREE WITH MANY OF MY AND YOUR COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION HERE BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO INVEST IN NATURAL RESOURCE. PROGRAMS FURTHER ADAPTATION BENEFITS AND THEY COMPLETELY FAILED TO DO SO. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS THE ASSEMBLY LOOKS TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL OF THEIR OWN THE YOU'D RATHER THAN STARTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WHICH SO CLEARLY MISSES THE MARK ON ISSUES THE YOU'VE MADE CLEAR ARE IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE START WITH THE SENATE -- PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOWNSTAIRS NEXT WHICH I THINK IS A MUCH MORE BALANCED PROPOSAL AND ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT -- ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO PREPARING FOR THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS CALL I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION MAYBE FIDELIO. IT'S HARD I IN IN IN IN LISTINGS OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS INTERMENT DETERMINING. THE EFFICACY OR THE METRICS AND HOW TO JUDGE WHETHER WHICH PROGRAMS ARE THE BEST OR THE OR OR NOT WORKING A WORKING. WOULD IT MAKES MORE SENSE FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT TO ACTUALLY DO A TWO YEAR PLAN. AND THEN -- PROVIDE SOME STABILITY AND THEN ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO DO OVERSIGHT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS ARE INDEED WORKING DEPENDING ON WHETHER THERE ARE CLEAR TRANSPARENT METRICS. AND WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE BEING -- I GET I GUESS I'M I'M NOT SURE ON FOR THE TWO TWO YEAR PLAN QUESTION. OF OR OR OR JUST ON THE TWO YEARS OF DOING IT THOUGH AND OUT THERE BUT MULTIPLE YEARS SO THERE IS SOME SOME STABILITY BUT THEN WE ACTUALLY DO HOLD THE PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABLE THAT IF THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED TO SHIFT THE FUNDS THE MORE -- COST EFFECTIVE -- ABOUT PROJECTS OR PROGRAMS YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE THE KIND OF CORE OFYOUR QUESTION AROUND -- YOU KNOW HOLDING PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE THERE WHEN WE ALLOCATE THE FUNDS THAT WERE REVIEWING IN OF THE PROGRAMS AND TRYING TO TRACK KIND OF CLEAR METRICS ON WHAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ACHIEVING AND THEN -- TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE WE KIND OF ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT TYPE OF PROCESS ABSOLUTELY IS THE TYPE OF PROCESS WITH THAT WE SHOULD BE SOME REPORTS THAT NHà COME OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS KIND OF AN ANNUAL REPORT TO COME THAT. COMES OUT THAT PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON METRICS FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT A LOT OF CASES IT'S IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION I THINK THAT -- FOR POLICY MAKERS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO KIND OF BALANCE A LOT OF THESE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATE WITH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING GHGS BUT AS AS WELL AS LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS AND OTHER THINGS AND SO. THEY'RE DOING WHAT YOU CAN -- TO YOU PUSH THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY'RE COMING FORWARD WITH BUT ALLOCATE WITH ALLOCATIONS AND PROPOSALS TO TRY AN OUTLINE WHAT THOSE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY ALLOCATE. ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND CUT KNOWING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR IS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT PROCESS TO FLOW IN IT IF THE CHAIRMAN TOLD ME I MEAN IN IN TERMS OF RECENTLY PLACE INVESTMENT UP UNTIL A LITTLE DEMAND -- BRIEF THIS BUT IT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN IN TERMS OF INTO THE AGRICULTURE IF YOU'RE IF YOU WERE CALLING FOR AGRICULTURE CHEN TO MAKE INVESTMENTS BUT YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT FROM YEAR AFTER YEAR AND IT ZEROS OUT OR GOES UP YOUR YOUR THEN NO ONE CAN PLAN. SO IN MY IN MY AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE THAT WE PROVIDED TO YEAR. THREE YEAR MULTI YEAR -- PLAN AND THEN IF AND THEN AS IT GOES AS AG THEIR GOALS AND THEN THE FUNDING GOES DOWN ON RIGHT IF THERE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THEN MAYBE MAKE INVESTMENTS AND SOMETHING ELSE. YEAH I MEAN I I THINK THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME BENEFITS TO PROVIDING CERTAINTY AROUND FUNDING OVER MORE THAN JUST ONE YEAR THAT HELPS WITH PLANNING FOR BUSINESSES AND THAT ARE MAKING KIND OF MORE LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS DECISIONS. THERE'S JUST THERE IS JUST THAT THIS TRADE OFF ON YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES MIGHT CHANGE A LITTLE BIT FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AND SO YOU'RE KEEPING THAT FLEXIBILITY IS IS ALSO IMPORTANT SOCIALLY BALLOTS IN THOSE TWO FACTORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS -- SO I AM GOING TO BE CALLING AN AUDIBLE HERE -- IF YOU WILL ON THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA WE HAVE MISTER OF BLUMENFELD HERE -- AND HE HAS SOME TIME CONSTRAINTS ARE GONNA SKIP FORWARD TO ISSUE FOR AND ADDRESS THE ONE AND ISSUE -- FOR CALLIE PA. WELCOME -- IT'S GOOD THANK YOU HERE -- I WAS JUST REMINDED THAT YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO'S LIKE THE AND TIRED HE OF THE A PACIFIC COAST TRAIL ALL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES SO -- YOU ARE STILL IN ONE PIECE. ASSEMBLY ERECT ONE PIECE YEAH WHEN DID YOU COMPLETE THAT -- I STARTED -- MAY NINTH TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I FINISH SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH. SO LIKE FOR FOUR MONTHS FEW DAYS YEAH. GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE. GERMAN. SO THIS IS THIS IS A VERY -- TARGETED REQUEST IN THE BUDGET -- I CAN GO INTO AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WANT BUT REALLY WANTED TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF IT -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- THE CALIFORNIA I'M ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WE HAVE BOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES THAT ARE AND US AND REALLY MY GOAL IS TO MAKE US ONE CAL EPA TO REALLY COORDINATE. THE FUNCTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULD NOT JUST WORKING IN A STOVE PIPES THAT WORK ACROSS THEM AS WE HAD A LITTLE BIT IN THE G. J. R. F. CONTEXT. YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT -- NO ANY BOUNDARIES AND AND REALLY NOT SURE DOT AGENCY SAYS. THE POSITIONS -- ARE ONES THAT I KIND OF NEEDED TO BRING US TOGETHER TO COORDINATE -- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS SERVING THE PUBLIC EFFECTIVELY SO -- I CAN GO THROUGH IN IN FAIRLY QUICK ORDER -- THE POSITIONS ARE IN IN THE AREAS OF STRATEGIC PLANNING. LEAN SIX SIGMA TRAINING INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS CONTRACT AND LABOR LAW AND ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION TO THOSE ALL OF THEM AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO. TO I'LL I'LL KIND OF JUST BRIEFLY. TALK ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM SAID THIS YOU SEE THAT. I THINK -- RATHER THAN -- GOING THROUGH A AT ALL A KIND OF A LINE ITEM -- DISCUSSION IF YOU COULD FOCUS YOUR COMMENTS ON THE STAFF COMMENT AND THAT A QUESTION OF HOW YOU WILL -- CLEARLY ARTICULATE THE OBJECTIVES -- FOR OF OUR FOR THESE POSITIONS AND AND AND HOW YOU'LL MEASURE SUCCESS I THINK THAT WOULD EXTREMELY HELPFUL CHAVEZ STARTING WITH GIGI PLANNING -- THE WAY THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING IS DONE IN THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES SOME LASTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE OTHERS DONE OR RECENTLY REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE OUR OBJECTIVES HOW DO WE EXPECT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY YOU IN THE PUBLIC -- THAT WITHOUT HAVING A CLEAR STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAME WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF DOING GOOD PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ONE OF THE HOLDING OUT STOP ACCOUNTABLE FULL SAYS CITY PLANNING IS IS THE MOST CRITICAL -- AND YOU KNOW THE THE ODDS ARE ABOUT COUNT ABILITY WILL REALLY BE IN THE AREA OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS HOW DO WE DEVELOP INDICATE IS. THAT WE CAN HAVE ON A WEBSITE WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH THE G. G. R. F. OR CRITERIA POLLUTANTS ALL PESTICIDES OR WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. WE NEED CLEAR METRICS -- IN ORDER TO GET THAT -- WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM OF LEAN SIX SIGMA WHICH IS A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT -- TOLD TO HELP STOP ACROSS THE AGENCY REALLY USE THAT TOOL. AS AN EXAMPLE HOW DO WE GET RID OF MANY OF THE PROCESS STEPS THAT WE HAVE AN UPCOMING. THAT YOU KNOW DR YOU KNOW SOME OF THE REGULATED COMMUNITY CRAZY BECAUSE I KNOW ADDING ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES -- BUT THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS I HAD A HAD A WEEK MAKE THAT -- WHAT MORE EFFECTIVELY AND THEN? WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CENTRAL WAY OF TRAINING THEM -- IF THERE ARE WHICH THEY ARE MOST VALUABLE ASSET REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE THE SKILLS GAP WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET. THE EMPLOYEES TO THE SKILLS WE NEED IN ORDER TO TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- BY EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THE FROM ETHICS TRAINING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- TO TO COMPETENCY ASSESSMENTS AND THEN WITH LEGAL SUPPORT THAT KIND OF ROUNDS OUT WHAT ONE OF OUR NEEDS WHICH IS. WE HAVE A VERY LARGE CONTRACTS -- THAT GO THROUGH THE AGENCYBUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE CONTROLS OVER THOSE CONTRACTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I COME BEFORE YOU. I CANNOT SO WAS SHORT THE ABOUT THE CLARITY OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE HAVING A LABOR CONTRACTS ATTORNEY FOR ME IT IS IS CRITICAL. AND THEN TO ROUND IT OUT -- THE LAST TWO POSITIONS WANTED TO DO INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS AND EXTERNAL WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW PART OF PART OF WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND IN MY PROBABLY TWENTY IS DOING GOVERNMENT. IS THAT WE OFTEN DON'T DO A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING TO OUR PUBLIC WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO FOR THEM -- AND SAYS EXPLAINING THE BENEFITS THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES -- TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO A STOP TO SOMETHING I I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON AND THEN THE FINAL. POSITION RELATES TO ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION HAVING CLEA -- CLEAR TARGETS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AROUND ENFORCEMENT HOW WE'RE DOING IT AND MAKING SURE THAT -- ALL THE DIFFERENT PUBLICS NOW ABOUT IT REALLY THEY GO TO CHAD TO THE HEART OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE ON SAYS. TO WHAT ARE THE METRICS OF OUR SUCCESS THESE POSITIONS WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT SO THEY ARE IN FACT INSTRUMENTAL TO ANSWERING THAT BASIC QUESTION. THANK YOU 	C OF ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A A NEW -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COME INTO -- POSITION IS HAVING A FRESH SET OF EYES AND ON ON A DEPARTMENT AND IT APPEARS SO YOU'RE. TAKING THAT QUITE SERIOUSLY AND MAKING SOME CHANGES THAT ALL -- HELP FACILITATE SOME -- SOME A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S ALREADY FUNCTIONING HIGHLY SO I THINK THAT'S GREAT -- TO THE LA -- HAVE QUESTIONS AND MS REYES. SHAMA WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE THINK THE BROAD GOALS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL HAVE MERIT HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL DIDN'T INCLUDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM IS BEING ADDRESSED AND AND ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT CALLIE PO'S CAN BE USED. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ACHIEVED SUCCESS WITH THEIR NEW -- PROPOSAL SO. WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE SECRETARY TESTIFYING ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT HE HAS ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- TODAY IN HIS TESTIMONY -- SO WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YESTERDAY AND SENATE SUB TO THEY ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE CALLIE PA TO PROVIDE DETAILS ON EXISTING SHORTCOMINGS. IN ADDRESS ACTIVITIES IT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN AND MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU OF A FINANCE NO REPORT TO A ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE IS THERE ANY -- PUBLIC COMMENT SEEING NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION APPRECIATE IT WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AS RECOMMENDED. AND THE NOW WILL JUMP BACK -- TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO AND THREE WILL TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT -- ON THE CPC -- TWO ISSUES AFTER WE COMPLETED ISSUE NUMBER. THREE BOTH OF THESE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN WILL BEGIN WITH. ISSUE TO THE WILDFIRE CLIMATE CHANGE [inaudible] MATTER. ALL NOTE THAT IT'S ALREADY -- ALMOST TEN FORTY FIVE AND WERE -- ONLY THREE ISSUES -- INTO THE AGENDA -- AS PER SE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS BERNARD AS A VETO. I AM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME THE CPC'S REPRESENTATIVES TO ADDRESS ISSUES TWO AND THREE THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE A AT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO ADD SOME COMMENTS -- HIGH AA AND LEASE ABOLISHING CAM THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SIXTEEN THE FOR SOME FOLLOW SAID THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THE WORLD PORTION OF THE REQUEST HERE AT THAT. IS BEING ASKED TO SAFETY IS -- TO CONTRACTS THE ONE IS FOR THIRTEEN MILLION TO DO POLICY WORK RELATED TO WILD FIRES AND THEN AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENTS AUTHORITY. L. -- FOR DOING INSPECTIONS OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COMMISSIONS GENERAL ORDERS AND THE L. WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS ARE BEING ADOPTED AND ALSO SOME STAFF AUGMENTATION TO SUPPORT SO PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFF FOR THE D. IMAGES ATION. L. PROGRAMS OF UTILITIES. THANK YOU HELLO. SO -- IN CONCEPT WE THINK THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE A LOT OF MERIT -- THEY'RE MEANT TO ADDRESS -- THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF MITIGATING WILDFIRE RISK FROM UTILITIES AND EMPLOYMENT AND WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLANS WE JUST WANT TO NOTE. THESE ARE ARE REALLY KIND OF NEW ACTIVITIES OR IN KIND OF NEW TERRITORY HERE AND THERE'S NO. CLEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR FOR EXAMPLE THE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ON KIND OF WHEN THOSE WILL ACTUALLY OUT BE OUT ON THE GROUNDS -- AND IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR KIND OF HOW THE PC WILL USE THEIR EXPERIENCE FOR THIS ONE TIME CONTRACT FOR LONGER TORN TERM ENFORCEMENT PLANNING AND ACTIVITIES. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE PC TO REPORT IN APRIL OF NEXT YEAR. ON HOW MUCH OF THE ENFORCEMENT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SWAT OUTCOMES THEY'VE ACHIEVED AND IMPORTANTLY HOW THE EXPERIENCES INFORMED OF LONG TERM -- DEVELOPMENT OF ONGOING MEDICATION PLAN ENFORCEMENT AND IN OUR VIEW THIS WOULD HELP -- ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE MITIGATION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION AND INFORM ON GOING FUTURE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO BE CAN UP THE STING THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU FINANCE. AMANDA MARTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN INTEREST TIME KEEP IT BRIEF BUT TO RESPOND TO THE LA THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THIS ONE FORM -- FUTURE ACTIVITIES WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE REQUESTS ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE OVER THREE YEARS IN THE IDEA BEING EXACTLY TO TAKE THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES TO INFORM WHETHER -- THESE KIND OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSPECTIONS TO CONTINUE WITH THE P. C. WITH ANOTHER ENTITY -- GET THAT KIND OF DATA -- NEEDED TO IMPROVE WILDLIFE MITIGATION PLAN SO THAT ONE TIME IS VERY INTENTIONAL. THANK YOU -- NOT SURE WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT HAS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED CREATING A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT -- TO OR NEEDED TO FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE WILDFIRE ISSUE IT SAYS SOMETHING IS GONNA BE WITH US. FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- THE PREVENTION INSPECTION WORK THAT THE CPC IS PROPOSING TO CONTRACT OUT MIGHT -- MIGHT THAT NOT BE -- HANDLE LONG TERM BY A STAFF. THERE IS NO PROPOSAL IN THE CURRENT MAY REVISION BUT AS A NOTED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP HAVE A DATE I KNOW THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS. ALL AROUND WILDFIRE HAPPENING WITH BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MINISTRATION SO -- THERE IS NOT A CURRENT PROPOSAL THE TABLE FOR THAT. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO CARE PROPOSAL I'M LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK -- MEN AND UNDERSTANDING OF YOU KNOW KIND OF WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION'S -- OR THE DEPARTMENTS THINKING AS ON THIS NOW. CHAIRMAN AND IF I MAY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SLIGHTLY FURTHER. OF THE GREAT THE DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND CAL FIRE ARE ACTIVELY MEANING. THEY ARE -- TRYING TO DETERMINE RECOMMENDATIONS -- AS DIRECTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THOSE PROPOSALS WILL COME FROM THOSE MEETINGS AS RECOMMENDATIONS TO FINANCE AND TO OTHERS IN THE FUTURE SO WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND TO MAKE THIS HIS RECOMMENDATIONS -- WOULD I BE CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN -- THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THE BUDGET TO IN THE CYCLE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS A MEMBER OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE WILDFIRE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON SB NINETY NINE A ONE I RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IS. TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES RELATED TO WILD FIRES AND TO DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I I AM INTERESTED HOWEVER IN THIS WILDFIRE SWAT TEAM AND THE THE THE THE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED. TO ENFORCE ARE THEY GOING TO ENFORCE WILDFIRE -- MITIGATION PLANS. IS A PART OF YOUR DOING. AND THEN THEIR SECOND PART IS ARE THEY GOING TO BE MONITORING EVERYTHING FROM THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO DEGENERATE DE ENERGIZED ENERGIZE ATION. OF THE ERA. THIS. PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST IS TO FILL THE CURRENT GAP AROUND INSPECTIONS SO THE PC DOES NOT HAVE ANY INSPECTION THE STAFF TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY INSPECT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AT SCALE OUR PROGRAM WAS SET UP AS AN AUDITING UNITS. TO REVIEW ALL RECORDS OF UTILITIES AND MAYBE DO SOME SPOT CHECKS BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CAPABILITY TO GO OUT. AND INSPECT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THIS SPECIFIC CONTRACTORS IN FOOD BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO A HALT. AND THEN CITY THAT CAN SCALE UP FAST THAT CAN GO OUT THERE AND ACTUALLY -- DO VERIFICATIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FIELDS WE GET THAT FEEDBACK AS TO THE REALITY ON THE GROUND VERSUS WHAT WE'RE SEEING CAN UP IN OUR PROCEEDINGS AND ON RECORDS -- EIGHTY I WOULD SAY THAT THE THERE ARE YOU KNOW PRIMARY FOCUS WOULD BE ON AN ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN EASILY VISUALLY INSPECT. ALL MY AS THIS PROGRAM DEVELOPS AND RAMPS UP THEY MAY START LOOKING EL ON HOPING WITH THE ASSISTANCE ALL. UNITS AROUND SOME OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE ENERGY IS THE USUAL HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING YOU COULD HAVE SOME AUGMENTATION OF STAFF FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO DO SOME VERIFICATIONS. IN THE FIELD ALTHOUGH IT CONDITIONS UTILITIES REPORTING WHEN THEY DID MAKING DECISIONS TO JENNER J. SOMETHING THE SAME AS HIGH THREAT CONDITIONS THIS HIGH WINDS YOU KNOW IF WE HAD THE KIND OF STOPPING TO SEND OUT AN INSPECTOR. TO THAT LOCATION TO VERIFY THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A HIGH THREAT CONDITION THAT COULD BE USEFUL WITH THE HOT STOP WITH THAT RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD SEE THAT AS THE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTION RIGHT NOW WE AT I WOULD SAY THE FIRST FOCUS FOR THEM WOULD BE. ON CONSTRUCTION DESIGN MAINTENANCE STANDARDS AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU -- COUPLE OF FURTHER COMMENTS -- A FIRST OF ALL -- THE NOMENCLATURE OF SWAT TEAM. DOESN'T QUITE SEEM TO BE APPROPRIATE. IN THIS -- IN IN THE SETTING COM I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BE SOMETHING THAT -- THAT -- IS AN OF AN INVESTIGATORY -- AND ENFORCEMENT NATURE BUT TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. THAT'S A LITTLE. LESS -- CONNECTED TO THE A VERY IMPORTANT -- SWAT TEAM WORKS IT'S DONE BY. ONE FOUR SPENT STEP UP FOR ME THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE -- BUT OF THE OTHER COMMENT -- IT'S THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO HAS MADE TO NUMEROUS PROPOSALS OF CROSS SO WIDE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S WILDFIRE ISSUE AND THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT -- OTHER THINKS BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT COORDINATION OF THESE EFFORTS TO COST THE STATE'S ROLE AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CONTRACT. OUT AND WHEN IT'S BEST TO DEVELOP. OUR IN HOUSE STATE EXPERTISE AND WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE. TO OF ALL ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS. A AND WITH THAT -- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE AND THEN AGAIN WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES TWO AND THREE AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THIS -- ONE LIFELINE ASSISTANCE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LIMóN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JONATHAN MARKETS NEVER PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TODAY WE'RE SEEKING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE LIFELINE PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS IS AN INCREASE OF SIXTEEN POINT 4% ON THE APPROPRIATION APPROVED A TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET OCT. IN COMPARING THE MAYBE VISION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED JANUARY BUDGET. THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE INCREASES BY EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF GROWTH AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND THE ADDITION OF PILOTS. STATE OPERATIONS ESTIMATE INCREASES BY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS IS DRIVEN LARGELY BY OUT REACH AMERICAN ELEMENTS OF THE PILOTS THAT WILL BE OCCURRING. IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ALEJO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- I DID JUST WANT TO FLAG JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- IT RELATES TO REPORT THAT -- WE ISSUED LAST MONTH WHICH WAS REQUIRED AND AN SRO WHICH REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT A COUPLE DIFFERENT ASPECTSOF THE LIFELINE PROGRAM ONE THEIR BUDGETING AND THE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING FUTURE PROGRAM COSTS -- AND ON THAT ISSUE WE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW IN THE PAST THERE BEEN A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND ESTIMATING THE COST FOR THIS PROGRAM LARGELY RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANT. CHANGE IN THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY INCLUDED WIRELESS TO THE PROGRAM AND SO THAT ADDED A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RESTAURANTS -- APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN IMPROVING AND QUITE A BIT IN RECENT. YEARS -- AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT IT'S JUST ONE OF FLAG OUT FOR YOU THERE IS SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY -- IF COSTS GO HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY'RE ESTIMATING HERE -- WE ALSO IN IN THAT REPORT KIND OF THE INCLUDED AN OPTION THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER ADDING SOME SORT CAP TO THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT WE DO THINK SOME FLEXIBILITY AS IS REASONABLE. THE SECOND ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM -- SOME CONCERNS I THINK AROUND KIND OF THE ENROLLMENT RATE JUST FOR CONTEXT THERE'S ABOUT ABOUT FORTY THE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT 40% OF THE ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS ARE ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. AND SO WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE AND THE OTHERS A FEW DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE IS JUST GENERAL AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM SO -- HOUSEHOLD MIGHT NOT BE BE AWARE THAT THE PROGRAM EVEN EXISTS -- TO EVEN IF THEY ARE AWARE IT MIGHT BE JUST A MATTER OF AND THEY PREFER ANOTHER PLANNER CARRIER TO THE ONES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED HERE AND THEN THIRD -- IT COULD JUST BE IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF IT IT'S DIFFICULT TO AND OR RENEW IN THE PROCESS AND SO -- WELL ALL THOSE IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE CURRENT ENROLLMENT RATE -- IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHICH ONES OF THOSE ARE KIND OF THE MAJOR FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IT AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO DIRECT THE PC. TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF THAT IT LIKELY IN THE FORM OF THE SURVEY OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WHICH ONE OF THESE FACTORS IS REALLY KIND OF THE PRIMARY. DRIVER -- FOR THE CURRENT ENROLLMENT RATES AND SO -- AS IT RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IT DOES INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED FUNDING FOR A PILOT -- THAT THE COMMISSION RECENTLY ADOPTED WHICH TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE BRINGING ON YOUR PROVIDING SUBSIDIES TO A NEW KERRIER THAT MIGHT BE -- KIND OF BETTER KNOWN AMONG SOME OF THE POPULATIONS AND INCLUDING SOME ADDITIONAL NEW KIND OF ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT PROCESS HE'S FOR CERTAIN -- HOUSEHOLDS AND SO THERE IS SOME MONEY IN THAT FOR THIS -- AND THE PC HAS AN ONGOING PROCEEDING WHERE THERE ARE VALUE AND SOME OTHER POTENTIAL PILOT PROGRAMS TO TRY TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM. YES HOW ARE YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER HARRISON. OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME ODD MILLION [inaudible] OPERATING FROM. FEES ON OTHER USERS CORRECT. THIS IS NOT A GENERAL FUND THIS IS A FEE THAT IS. TAKEN FROM. OTHER. PEOPLE ON A RECURRING BASIS CORRECT ANOTHER TELEPHONE THOSE YES YEAH THAT'S RIGHT -- IS A SOME ODD MILLION. GOING TO THE SUBSIDIES NECESSARY TO GET THESE INDIVIDUALS THE RIP RELIEF. OR ARE THEY ARE THIRD PARTY. PARTICIPANTS IN THIS THAT ARE GETTING SOME OF THIS MONEY -- SO THERE'S A PORTION OF THE MONEY THAT GOES TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT HELPS ADMINISTER THE ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT PROCESS -- THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IS THAT THE SUBSIDIES ARE PROVIDED TO THE CARRIERS THEMSELVES. WHICH THEN -- KIND OF DETERMINE THE STRUCTURE OF THE SERVICE THAT THEY OFFER BUT THERE'S SORT OF A FLAT SUBSIDY THAT GOES TO THE CARRIERS -- THAT DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF THE AND OUT HOW HELD OUT A ROLE OR HUNDRED AND SOME ODD MILLION HOW MUCH OF THAT. ACTUALLY GETS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ALMOST ALL OF IT BUT I MEAN I THINK IT'S IT'S STILL BE YOU SEE NOW. SO DOES STATE OPERATIONS ARE AT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION AND THAT INCLUDES TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR -- AND THEN I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO ANSWER ON THE KIND OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE CARRIERS TO THEN PROVIDE -- THE SUBSIDIZED PHONE SERVICE BECAUSE THE SUBSIDY GOES TO THE KERRIER -- AND THEN THAT THEY KIND OF DETERMINE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXACTLY THE SERVICES THAT'S OFFERED TO THE TO THE CUSTOMERS OF THE CUSTOMERS GETTING. SOME BENEFIT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO KIND OF QUANTIFY THE THE EXACT DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THAT OKAY [inaudible] ANY OTHER. JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WE DO REVIEW AND APPROVE THE PLANS. AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS. ARE -- DISCOUNTS OFF RETAIL PLANS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBSIDIES FORM DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMERS AND OF THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ARE FOR SUBSIDY PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS. AS THE HELLO POINTS OUT THEY DO GO. THE KEIRSEY COMPENSATION AFTER THEY OFFER THE DISCOUNTED SERVICE TO CONSUMERS AND IS THAT SOUGHT COMPENSATION. CONNECTED TO THE ENROLLMENT YES THAT THIS IS DIRECTLY BASED UPON THE ROMAN YOU OUT OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME ODD. THAT MONEY IS GOING TO ENROLLEES AND ROBERTS THAT'S CORRECT YES THANK YOU -- I THINK MS REVERSE YOUR FIRST IN THIS RACE. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS VERY LOW IN MORE THAN ROLL MAN YOU KNOW 40%. OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICE THAT REALLY NEEDS IT. AND PROBABLY THERE'S NO OUT REACH THEIR TWIN ROLE ANYBODY IN THIS PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND I REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT -- BUT YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE AN ENROLLMENT GOAL AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS YEAR TO GET THEIR SURE SO THERE'S SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING ENROLLMENT OCCURS PRIMARILY IN TWO WAYS. FOR WIRELINE CUSTOMERS IT OCCURS WHEN THEY CONTACT KERRY TO ESTABLISH SERVICE IN THE KERRY INFORMS THEM OF LIFELINE. AND FOR WIRELESS CUSTOMERS ENROLLMENT AS A MAN FOR HER REFERENCE TO WHAT ARE CALLED STREET TEAMS THERE THE POP UP TENTS THAT YOU MAY SEE. IN YOUR AREA AND THOSE ARE WAYS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT PILOTY WAYS TO USE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE THE AWARENESS AND COMMUNITIES. WE A PILOT CURRENTLY BEFRIEND BEFORE US THAT WE'RE EVALUATING THAT THE PIPE DEEPLY HAS TO DO WITH. THE S. R. OWES IN GETTING DOING OUTREACH TO THOSE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES BUT WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGING OTHER PILOTS TO BE SUBMITTED. INCREASE ENROLLMENT THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS THE TEAM PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CAN BE BASED ORGANIZATIONS EDUCATION ABOUT TELECOMMUNICATIONS ISSUES WERE PARTING WITH -- TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF LIFE FLIGHT. OKAY I'M YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE SOME BARRIERS FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- TO HELP WITH THAT OUR REGION I HOPE THAT -- THE CPUC WILL BE WORKING TO STREAMLINING GET RID OF THOSE BARRIERS. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN YES WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THE GOAL. THANK YOU [inaudible] HIS REST. CLEARLY NOT A DATE FOR SHEET THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ON THIS THAT SO FEW ARE RECEIVING THE BENEFITS THAT IS. BY ITS VERY NATURE BY ITS VERY NAME A LIFELINE -- IT JUST A THOUGHT -- AND GOING BACK TO MS REVERSES COMMENTS WE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF PERHAPS I'M SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT OF THIS BUT I WANT TO ASK. ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT AS YOU GIVE THE INFORMATION DID YOU USE THOSE. GROUPS THAT ARE ALREADY RECEIVING BENEFITS THAT WOULD CLASSIFY THEM AS BEING UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL OR OR BEING IN NEED LIKE THE RECIPIENTS OF SS I SS P. -- CAL FRESH CAL WORKS TO PROVIDE THE INFIRMITY FORMATION TO THEM SO THAT THEY KNOW THIS IS A BENEFIT THAT THEY PROBABLY ALREADY QUALIFY. FOR YES WE ARE ACTIVELY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL FOR US IN WITH OTHER STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE. A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BENEFITS. TO BOTH PARTNER WITH THEM IN TERMS OF OUT REACH BUT ALSO POTENTIAL TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO DO ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS ENROLLMENT IN OUR PROGRAM. SO WE'RE HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS ACTIVELY. ONE OF I WILL TELL YOU THAT IN MY COMMUNITY. FOR MY SENIOR FAIRS THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY THERE ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE TO TALK TO MY SENIORS MY APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. GLAD TO HEAR THAT THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST -- BEFORE WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT -- A CALL ATTENTION TO THE STAFF COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM THAT TO REFER TO THE GROWTH OF THE CPUC THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT OF BEEN TAKEN ON AND AND KIND OF RAISING THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT -- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO EVALUATE -- WHERE THE RIGHT HOME FOR THIS PARTICULAR -- THE PROGRAM -- IS -- I I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM -- FOR INCREASING THE THE UTILIZATION OF LIFELINE PROGRAM AND IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL VALUE AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT GIVEN -- THE INCREASE IMPORTANCE THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY HOUSE BOTH FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES AND JUST REALLY YOU KNOW BEING CONNECTED. IN GENERAL SO -- IT IS -- A REFER TO AS SOMETHING WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THROUGH THE POLICY -- PROCESS AND OF THAT -- THROWS OUT AN IDEA FOR OF A BILL IN THE NEXT -- TO HALF OF THE SESSION I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY A APPROPRIATE SO THAT WE CAN DO SOME OF THE U. ATION AT A MINIMUM OF THAT CONCEPT. OF AND WITH THAT WE'LL LOOK AT WILL LOOK TO RECEIVE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW AND ISSUES TWO AND THREE AND AGAIN PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS CONSTRAINED AS POSSIBLE YES SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST ABOUT THE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY JUST TO REITERATE THE GREAT CONCERN THAT WE HAVE FOR ONLY 40% PARTICIPATION RATE -- THIS IS AN ISSUE NOT ONLY FOR ACCESS TO BENEFITS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO TO MOVE OUT -- THE APPLICATION PROCESS -- FOR HOW WORKS MEDICAID COVERAGE ONTO A MORE ELECTRONIC PROCESS AND TELEPHONIC PROCESS AND AS WE DO THAT. AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T OF BRING THESE FEDERALLY FUNDED AND SAY FUNDED -- PHONE TELEPHONE SUPPORTED -- BENEFITS TO EVERYBODY WHO'S ELIGIBLE WERE UNDERMINING EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING ELSEWHERE -- ONE LAST THING TO KNOW AND THAT IS WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS AND WITH HOMELESSNESS -- BEING -- AS AS BIG AS IT IS -- HAVING ACCESS TO A PHONE ISN'T JUST ACCESS TO BENEFITS IT'S ALSO ACCESS TO HELP -- PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS ARE INCREASINGLY VICTIMS OF CRIME AND HAVING -- AWAY TO CALL FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT IS IS IMPORTANT AND SO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE REGULAR. ONGOING STUDY NON INTERRUPTED ACCESS TO HAVE -- LIFELINE -- ARE UNDERMINED AND AND GETTING THAT HELP AS WELL. SO WE URGE YOUR FURTHER CONSIDERATION SUPPORT FOR HER PERCENT PARTICIPATION RATES AND THANK YOU FOR THE CALL FOR SECTION. HELLO I'M DATING JOHNSON ON THE CEO AND OWNER OF TRUE CONNECT COMMUNICATIONS WERE THE ONLY CALIFORNIA BASED TO LIFE ON PROVIDER. FOR WIRELESS AND PREVIOUSLY WIRELINE SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA -- SUCH WERE VERY -- SUPPORT OF THE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET OUR FOCUS IS MORE ON THE OUTREACH -- THAT'S OCCURRING WE'RE KANSI FOCUS ON AVERAGE WITH CBO'S. IN RURAL AREAS OUR MAIN ISSUES RELATED -- TO THE ISSUE AROUND HOW WE CAN DO OUTRAGE WHEN THEIR CONSTITUTIONS RELATED. TO GETTING THE FULL PROGRAM -- ON ELECTRONIC DIGITAL FORMAT. FROM THE IN THE ROMAN IS DONE THROUGH DIGITAL PROCESS WITH THE TPI. INTO THAT AND THAT PART WORKS BUT WITH ISSUES RELATED WE CERTIFICATION OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. STILL NOT DIGITAL AFTER FOUR YEARS -- THAT MAKES THE ISSUE VERY CUMBERSOME AND RESULTS IN A LOT OF CHURN FOR CARRIERS. WE HAVE FOCUS ON CHURN AND MAINTAIN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE ROLE IN OUTREACH EFFORTS SO THOSE ISSUES TENTATIVE LAWSON'S CONVERSATION. AT THIS CONVERSATION IF YOU LOOK FOR YEARS NOW. AND WE VERY MUCH WANT TO GET THAT ADDRESSED -- TO ADDRESSTHE QUESTION THAT THAT SOME WOMEN PATTERSON PROPERLY -- YES THE BULK OF THE FUNDING GOES TOWARDS TORQUE SERVICE THE AND CONSUMER -- IT'S CARRIED THROUGH BOTH AND COSTS REALLY THE TP A FOR THE DIGITALLY -- PROVIDED SERVICE -- THAT'S PAID THROUGH THE CBC AND THE CARERS PEANUTS AND OTHERS. COVER THE COST TO PROVIDE A SERVICE UP FRONT AND THEN WE SEEK REVERSING THE CPC AFTERWARDS SO MAJORITY ACROSS IS COVERED AND DIRECTOR BECAUSE THE CONSUMER. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH THE CABLE INDUSTRY -- WE HAVE SOME -- CAN RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WITH MAY BE PREMATURE AT THIS TIME AND MISTER PATTERSON'S POINT. THIS IS ALMOST A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS SO THIS IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL -- SURCHARGES THAT A CUSTOMER WILL HAVE ON THEIR BILL EVER TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THE NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE THIS CAN BE MORE THAN DOUBLE SO IT GOING FROM ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR CENTS. SO THIS THIS WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS ALMOST -- WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SALUTE BIT MORE INSURANCES ABOUT GETTING TO THE BEYOND THAT 40% PARTICIPATION RATE. THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PROPOSING HERE TODAY OR THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSED HERE TODAY IS NOT. IT'S IT'S TARGET A CERTAIN GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS THIS IS GOING TO BE FOSTER KIDS UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO JUST INCREASE YOUR NUMBERS THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO IT. BUT WE WOULD SAY STEP BACK I THINK LET'S JONES HAS RECOMMENDED A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FORMAL STUDY OF THE PROGRAM TO FIND OUT HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT GETTING SERVICES TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE -- I THINK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S IN THE MID NINETIES HAD A GREAT STUDY THAT WAS CALL MAKING GOVERNMENT MAKES SENSE. AND IN THAT STUDY THEY LOOK AT WHERE AT BIRD THE CONTACT POINTS THAT YOU MEET THESE INDIVIDUALS SO MAYBE IT IS MAYBE ANOTHER APARTMENT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT SHOULD -- IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM BUT AT THIS POINT WE'RE WE HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS BUT THE PROGRAM BUT WE ARE SUPPORTER OF THE OF THE PROGRAM OVERALL THANK YOU.

OF THE PILOTS WILL COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING SO THEY CAN FLY THE C. ONE THIRTIES AS SOON AS THOSE AIRCRAFT ARRIVE. OF THE EXCLUSIVE USE TO SEE ONE THIRTY WOULD ALSO HAVE A SECONDARY BENEFIT. OF BEING AN ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT CARRYING FOUR THOUSAND GALLONS RETARDANT. A TO FIGHT FIRES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THESE FEDERAL AGENCIES. AND IN THE JANUARY BUDGET WE HAD TO ASSUME THAT THE FIRST PLANET BEALE DELIVERED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT I HAD HOPED THAT A PLANE WOULD BE DELIVERED SOONER THAN THAT -- WITH THAT TO LEARNING THAT THAT WASN'T GOING TO OCCUR -- WE'RE COMING FORWARD WITH A REQUEST FOR OF THIS TRAINING PLATFORM FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS WITHOUT THIS PLATFORM -- WE WILL HAVE CREWS AS THE NEW SEE ONE THIRTIES COME IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO FLY THESE AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY ARE TRAINED -- THERE BY SITTING ON THE TARMAC AT MCCLELLAN OR THEIR LOCATIONS A.

OF THAT WE WOULD EXPECT AT LEAST ONE OF THEM TO GO IN SERVICE AND TWENTY TWENTY IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BASED ON AIRFORCE TIMELINES WE WOULD EXPECT TO RECEIVE ONE AND WOULD HAVE TWO AIRCRAFT ONLINE. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WE WOULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT FROM THE AIRFORCE -- WITH FOUR PLANES ONLINE IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WOULD RECEIVE THE FINAL TWO WITH FIVE AIRPLANES ONLINE. THE RESULTS FIVE INSTEAD OF SEVEN IS TWO OF THOSE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE IN MAINTENANCE RESERVE ONE IS GENERALLY ALWAYS.

AS WELL AS THE INTERN OUTER WING BOXES OF THE AIRCRAFT TO BE RETROFITTED IN THE MAINTENANCE DONE OF THESE AIRCRAFT. PRIOR TO DIRECTLY TRANSFERRING THEM TO OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO THE BERRIES ARE BARRIERS -- TO BE.

TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OF THE SECOND ONE UNFORTUNATELY WAS INVOLVED IN IT IN A IN AN ACCIDENT -- IS BEING TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAS RELATIVELY MINOR IT'S BEEN REPAIRED AND IS CURRENTLY BEEN FLOWN TO DECATUR TEXAS FOR ITS PAINT. FROM THERE WILL GO TO INGLEWOOD COLORADO FOR ITS AVIONICS EXPECTED IN THE FALL -- AFTER THAT WILL EXPECT THIS THE S. SEVENTY AYE -- HELICOPTERS RECEIVER TO TO ARRIVE EVERY HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OR SO THEY'RE NOT HELD WE GET TO TWELFTH UNTIL WE GET. TO TWELVE ASSUMING THAT -- IN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET APPROVED THE ACQUISITION OF FOR ADDITIONAL HELICOPTER SHORTLY AFTER JULY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SORRY NINETEEN AND THE FINAL THREE I'M SURE HE WOULD GLADLY. MAKE THAT HAPPEN THANK YOU SIR HAS ASSUMING THAT -- AND NONE OF THE OTHER HELICOPTERS FALL OFF OF TRUCKS. YES I DID I DID THIS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT GET AN AIR FLEET THAT THAT IS. THIS SIZE AND ACT QUICKLY -- TO DEPLOYED I THINK AIR -- IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE CRITICAL FACTORS IN GOING FOR WITH SOME OF THESE BIG EXPLOSIVE FIRES I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND I I THINK WE ALL. ARE CHEN YANG GETTING HERE GET HIM UP IN THE AIR AS FAST AS WE CAN THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. LA ALSO ADD THAT IT HOW FAR HAS NOTED THAT THAT PROPOSAL OR SORT OF THAT THAT PROPOSAL IS COST NEUTRAL -- AND WE JUST WANT TO FLAG FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT WHILE THERE WILL LIKELY BE SAM OFFSETTING SAVINGS AND THROUGH AT THE PROCUREMENT OF CONTRACT PLANES I DURING PEAK FIRE SEASON SINCE THIS PROPOSAL HAS SORT OF TWO PURPOSES. MEETING THAT PEAK FIRE SEASON NEED AS WELL AS THE TRAINING PLATFORM -- IT'S IT'S SORT OF INCONCLUSIVE TO WHAT EXTENT THAT WILL FULLY OFFSET THE COSTS HERE SO THAT IT COULD BE AT SORT OF A COST INCREASE EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. REALLY IT'S ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT THE NEEDS WOULD BE DURING PEAK FIRE SEASON OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS. A WHILE THIS PLANE IS UNDER CONTRACT WHICH NOBODY CAN REALLY PREDICT ANSWER DID JUST WANT TO FIND OUT FOR YOU HOWEVER AS IS INDICATED THERE ARE BENEFITS TO HAVING THE PLANE AND ALREADY UNDER CONTRACT -- AS OPPOSED TO DOING A CALL WHEN NEEDED WHERE IT'S AVAILABLE MORE QUICKLY AND IT ALSO HAS THAT COULD BENEFIT OF BEING. THE PUT THAT TRAINING PLATFORM FOR THIS HE WENT THIRTIES AND ALSO JUST KIND OF WANT. TO REITERATE THIS IS REALLY PART OF THE LARGER C. ONE THIRTY PROPOSAL THAT THE COMMITTEE REVIEW THAT WAS -- BUT FOR IN JANUARY. AND WHILE IT DOES HAVE THESE OTHER BENEFITS RELATED TO PEAK FIRE SEASON YOU MAY WANT TO ALIGN -- WHAT YOU DO ON THIS PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS ON THE LARGER C. ONE THIRTY PURPLES ALL? ON AND AND HOW THAT BALANCES OUT WITH ALL OF THE AND FIRE. SUPPRESSION PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY LANDS ON THANK YOU FOR MY FINANCE HOUSING YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO REITERATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS PLAN AVAILABLE TO CAL FIRE TO ENHANCE ITS FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT WE CAN TRAIN THE FLIGHT. CREWS CRIED CB FLIGHT CREWS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE SEA WHEN THIRTIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- FOLLOWING THEIR DELIVERY. THANK YOU I I THINK IN CONTEXT THIS DOES THIS DOES MAKE SENSE BUT IT ALLOWS ME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY -- TO TALK ABOUT -- OUR AIR PROGRAM IN IN GENERAL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- OVER THE YEARS AT LEAST SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE -- OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN MORE REACTIVE THAN PROACTIVE -- WHEN IT CAME TO THE HELICOPTERS WE HAD TO REPLACE THAT SLEEP BECAUSE -- THE EXISTING. A FLEET OF HELICOPTERS TO REACH THEIR WELL BEYOND THE THERE -- PERIOD OF OBSOLESCENCE -- AND THIS IS A PROGRAM OF OPPORTUNITY THAT -- SEE ONE THIRTIES HAVE SORT OF BEEN OFFERED -- A TO US BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THERE'S SOME ADVANTAGES. TO US IN IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OF THAT OFFER AND THEN THIS TRAINING PROGRAM FOLLOWS. I HAVE A GOVERNOR BROWN -- CO A QUITE APPROPRIATELY -- TALKED ABOUT -- WILDFIRES THAT THE CURRENTLY AND IN THE FUTURE IS THE NEW NORMAL -- AND YET I DON'T THINK WE HAVE -- TAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT THE FIREFIGHTING GUY AIR FLEET OF THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN DOING THAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHETHER -- WE SHOULD BE FINDING A WAY TO DEVELOP AIRCRAFT THAT ARE BUILT TO FROM THE GROUND UP SPECIFICALLY FOR FIRE FIGHTING PURPOSES IF THIS IS OUR NEW NORMAL AND IT CERTAINLY -- IS -- THEN SHOULD OUR FLEET NOT -- REFLECT THAT IN OUR THEIR COST EFFICIENCIES THAT -- KAMEL ALONG WITH THAT -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN A POSITION TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BUT WE SHOULD PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN THEN -- BEGIN ALLOCATING FUNDS -- TO AT ACHIEVE -- BOTH A MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT -- TO ERR -- ERR FLEET -- AND WITH THAT WENT AWAY -- MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- TEN THE FARMERS SOLUTION. GOOD MORNING FAILING PARKER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WE'VE BEEN UNDERGOING A MISSION BASED FIRE MARSHALL'S FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY REFLECTS THE CULMINATION OF THAT REVIEW OF THAT DIVISION THIS IS BEEN REALLY A DEEP DIVE IN COLLABORATION. WITH THE DIVISION. I WOULD POINT YOU TO LAST YEAR'S -- PROPOSAL WHICH WAS A REALLY A DETAILED AND COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE WORKLOAD -- AND WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE THE INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT HAS OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS AS THE CONSTRUCTION BOOM AS OCCURRED YOU JUST NEED. TO LOOK AROUND. AND SEE ALL THE CONSTRUCTION CRANES THAT ARE CURRENTLY. DOTTING THE SKYLINE IS -- ACTING FIRE MARSHAL -- RICH WIND. WHAT IT OUT YESTERDAY? IN THAT BCP LAST YEAR WE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL KEY THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED -- IN THE REMAINDER OF THEIR VIEW WHICH WAS A STATUTORY REVIEW OF THAT. KIND OF FRAMEWORK AND REGULATIONS THAT THE DIVISION OPERATES AND ALSO TRYING TO ADDRESS. ANY CONSTRUCTION DELAYS OR PROJECT DELAYS THAT ARE. RELATED TO SOME OF THEIR STAFFING -- ISSUES. AND FINALLY -- A LOOK AT THEIR BILLING RATES AND METHODOLOGY SO WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAIL UNLESS YOU HAVE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE REALLY FEEL THAT THIS PROPOSAL -- ADDRESSES THOSE CRITICAL NEEDS AND AND REALLY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THOSE THREE ISSUES THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED. IN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- LA -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND THAT THEY RESOURCES AND THE CHANGES I'M BEING PROPOSED HERE DO APPEAR TO BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS ADDRESSING CONCERNS THAT WE SORT OF ANECDOTALLY HEARD. OVER THE YEARS RELATED -- TO THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND DO YOU JUST WANT TO FLAG FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT -- WHEN THIS WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE YESTERDAY ON THE SENATE DID REJECT THE PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE -- I LEAVE JUST WANTING MORE TIME TO REALLY HAVE THE LEGISLATURE BE ABLE TODAY AGAIN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE SORT OF BASS PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES -- AND SO WHILE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND IT DOES APPEAR TO BE A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD MORE TIME YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO FURTHER YOU MIGHT THINK OF MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED -- LAST -- OR BEAT WANT TO TAKE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF IT AND SO JUST ONE TO FIGHT THE SENATE ACTION FOR YOU -- AND TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS MORE TIME AND YOU KNOW THE THE MINISTRATION CAN ALWAYS BRING IT BACK NEXT YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU -- FINANCE. THE CHROME. I WOULD JUST NOTE -- EITHER THE PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH IN CHOOSING THESE -- MISSION BASED REVIEWS NOT JUST THIS ONE BUT IT ABMAYBE WHERE WE'RE GOING UNDERGOING A YOU KNOW AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT MISSION BASED REVIEWS OF A PROGRAMS UNDER OR DEPARTMENTS AND THESE ARE REALLY. CHOSEN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- WHETHER THEY REFLECTS CRITICAL NEEDS OF THE STATE OR THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS HAS -- YOU KNOW HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS -- IN ONGOING CHALLENGES OR THE SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND IMPACT -- AND SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- WE REALLY AS THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE THAT THIS -- MISSION BASED REVIEW WAS IT WAS CHOSEN FOR SEVERAL. OF THOSE REASONS -- AND AND AND THAT THESE THESE RESOURCES ARE REALLY -- CRITICAL -- YOU KNOW NOT JUST FOR THE DIVISION BUT FOR THE STATEWIDE -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AS I MENTIONED -- DUE TO THE NATURE OF OF THE CONSTRUCTION BOOM THAT'S GOING ON AND SO MUCH OF THAT WORK LIVE FLOWING THROUGH THE DIVISION -- REALLY YOUR AIMED AT AVOIDING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DELAYS -- AND AND REALLY STREAMLINING SOME OF THEIR THEIR WORK -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RICHARD BLOOM A MIKE RICH WINE ACT IN STATE FIRE MARSHAL FIND ME AT ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS -- MISSION BASED BUDGET REVIEW IT'S BEEN A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. FOR FOR THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL VERY GRATEFUL. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES TEAM COMING IN DOING A DEEP DIVE INTO OUR MISSION AND OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND AN OPENNESS TO RIGHT SIZE OUR PROGRAM. IT'S BEEN PLAGUED WITH -- WITH STAFFING ISSUES FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND AND HAS RESULTED IN IN DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION AND AND CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES. AND SO WE FEEL THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH THESE POSITIONS WILL AUGMENT OUR EXISTING STAFFING AND PROVIDE SOME CRITICAL RESOURCES AT A TIME WHEN IT'S NEEDED SO WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. A YOU'RE WELCOME -- LET'S MOVE ON TO A ISSUE. ELEVEN THANKS AGAIN CERTIFICATION. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM -- CAL PLAYERS REQUESTING ONE POINT ONE MILLION -- FROM OUR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION FIND AND FOR POSITION STARTING IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO SUPPORT OUR FIRE ENGINEERING AND INVESTIGATIONS DIVISIONS. BUILDING MATERIALS AND FLAME RETARDANT PROGRAM -- THIS PROPOSAL WILL ENABLE THE TWO PROGRAMS TO SATISFACTORY UPHOLD OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE REGULATIONS TO CONDUCT EVALUATIONS IMPLEMENT INSPECTIONS AND EXECUTED MUCH NEEDED ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS -- FOR EXAMPLE INVESTIGATING REPORTS OF LICENSE AND PRODUCT FRAUD. IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER. THE THE DIVISIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH REGULATORY FEE INCREASES. TO THE TWO PROGRAMS FEE STRUCTURES ADDED THROUGH THIS REQUEST. IN THESE THREE STRUCTURES HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OVER TWO DECADES -- SO WE CONSTANTLY GET -- REQUESTS FROM FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS -- REQUESTING ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND SO THEY'RE VERY -- VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF OF EFFORTS TO INCREASE STAFFING TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT COMES WITH AN INCREASED COST. THANK YOU OHIO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE FINAL ISSUE -- I JUST LOVE THE TITLE OF THIS ONE INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT. A GERMAN BLOOM THANK YOU AGAIN JOE TYLER AT YOU FIRE PROTECTION WITH CAL FIRE. THIS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL REQUEST FIFTEEN MILLION TO ENABLE CAL FIRE TO PROCURE. INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO COMBAT THE STATE'S WILDLAND FIRE CRISIS CONSISTENT WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS ZERO FOUR DASH NINETEEN THAT WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BY THE GOVERNOR KNEW SOME. OF THIS PROCESS IS SEEKING -- IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS TO HELP MITIGATE THAT RISK THROUGH EARLY WILDFIRE DETECTION PREDICTION A PATH OF TRAVEL OF FIRE THAT ALLOWS US TO USE PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS. TO PROVIDE WARNINGS AND NOTIFICATIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE FIRE TO BOTH RESPOND HERS DECISION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE -- THE ELEVATORS WERE -- WERE PLACED INTO A PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT MY PARTNER BESIDE ME TOMAR ARMSTRONG FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WILL EXPLAIN -- BUT WITH THAT -- THEY HAVE CURRENTLY SUBMITTED -- SEVERAL IDEAS INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO AN EVALUATION PANEL THAT IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THOSE WERE DUE BY. APRIL TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH A GOAL TO HAVE THE EVALUATION TEAM. ADDRESS EIGHT EIGHT ONE OR MORE PROOF OF CONCEPT IDEAS. TO BE LOOKED AT BETWEEN JULY AND NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH THE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO WARD TO A CONTRACTORS SOMEBODY WHO HAS GREAT TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIVE IDEAS. TO HELP MITIGATE THE FIRE THREATENED CALIFORNIA BY MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WITH THAT -- HELLO BUT FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I'M NOT SEEING ANY LA -- I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO SOME BRIEF COMMENTS SURE AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M AS AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND IT TYPICALLY A DEPARTMENT TO WELL ALL. AND DECIDE WHAT IT WANTS TO DO. FIGURE OUT THE SCOPE OF THAT PROVIDE DETAILS OF THAT HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST AND THEN COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUEST FUNDING -- IN THIS CASE I AM CAL FIRE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING A DIFFERENT PROCUREMENT APPROACH THAT SORT OF FLIP THINGS AROUND AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ASKING FOR MONEY BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ARTICULATE WHAT EXACTLY IT WOULD FIND AND THAT'S JUST DUE TO THE SORT OF CREATIVE. NATURE OF THIS PROCUREMENT METHOD -- RECOGNIZING THAT THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE. WANTS TO CONSIDER AND BUT WE WOULD SORT OF NOTE THAT AND THERE'S CONCERNS WITH THE IF YOU GO ALONG WITH THE PROPOSAL THERE'S PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE. AND THAT HAS SOME REPORTING AND AND WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT LANGUAGE AND SPECIFICALLY IT ALLOWS AN UNLIMITED AUGMENTATION SO THERE'S NO CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BE APPROVING IF YOU APPROVE THIS LANGUAGE OTHERS AUGMENTATIONS WOULD GO THROUGH A MAJOR BUDGET ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULDN'T COME BACK. BEFORE -- THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE OR THE LEGISLATURE I'M MORE BROADLY AND SO YOU. UNDER THE PROPOSAL YOU DON'T QUITE HAVE A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY COMMITTING YOUR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. TO HEAR AND IN ADDITION THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE TYPE OF INFORMATION. THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE SO AND THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCUREMENT PROCESS CAL FIRE HAS RECEIVED THEY SORT OF PUT OUT A CALL FOR IDEAS THEY'VE RECEIVED THOSE BACK. ON IN EVALUATING THIS OUR QUEST I'M OUR OFFICE IN YOUR STAFF HAD ASKED THE DEPARTMENT FOR INFORMATION ON WHAT WHAT THE STATUS OF THE PROCUREMENT IS HOW MANY. ON INNOVATORS OUR IDEAS HAVE COME FORWARD WHAT THE SCOPE OF THOSE IS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE I'M AND UNFORTUNATELY THE MINISTRATION IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT AND THEY ARE UNDER CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. BEING THAT THEY ARE MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND SO BUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION OF NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE BUYING FOR THIS FIFTEEN MILLION OR FIFTEEN MILLION PLUS. IN FUNDING SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU DO WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS RECOGNIZING THERE COULD BE SOME BENEFITS -- IT TO MODIFY THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO FIRST PUT A CAP ON THE TOTAL LEVEL OFFENDING SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR YOUR TOTAL COMMITMENT IS -- FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND SECOND REQUIRE THAT ALL NOTIFICATIONS THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR THOSE MAJOR CHANGES BE THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATIONS IN SOME CASES THE EGGS THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS A FIFTEEN DAY NOTIFICATION WHICH REALLY JUST DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW -- POTENTIAL FUNDING INCREASES I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT AND CAO FIGHTER PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- ONCE THEY'RE PAST THIS INITIAL REVIEW PERIOD AND TO GIVE A SENSE BEFORE THEY START COMMITTING FINDS AS HOW MANY PROPOSALS DID THEY GET WHAT WERE THEY TYPES SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT THERE ENABLE TO ANSWER. I'M AND THEN FOURTH AND TO REQUIRE CAL FAIR TO PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION AT THE OUTCOMES OF ANY FIELD TESTING TO REALLY JUST GIVE MORE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING YOU ALL ALONG. AND AS THIS GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS AND RATHER THAN AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR THANK YOU FOR FINANCE CHURCHES WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY HAD THE GOVERNOR ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER AND FOR NINETEEN AND INITIATED THE INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT REALLY WITH THE INTENT. OF ADDRESSING AND THAT SORT OF SEVERE WILDFIRE CONDITIONS THE STATE IS FACING AND THE ENTIRE GOAL OF THE INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT AND THIS PROCESS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN THE STATE CAN DEPLOY THE WILDFIRE SOLUTIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- AND SO WE'RE SORT OF NOT OPERATING UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WERE OPERATING UNDER VERY ABNORMAL CONDITIONS IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE SORT OF A NEW NORMAL RELATED TO THAT SORT OF SEVERE -- AND INCREASED WILDFIRE ACTIVITY THE NUMBER OF WILDFIRES EXCITE ARRESTED THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS AGAIN JUST DESIGNED AROUND ENSURING THAT WE CAN GET THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND AND AND ANY SORT OF I CHANGES TO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE DELAY IS THAT THE TIME LINES ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT THAT THAT SORT OF FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ALLOCATED FOR THE PROOF OF CONCEPT PHASE WHICH AGAIN WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR THAT. TO BE ABLE TO SPEND WITHIN THE FIVE MILLION ANY. EXPENDITURES ABOUT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND THE JAIL BC PROCESS AND WE WANT IT DEPLOYED THOSE SOLUTIONS THIS SUMMER AND SO THAT. AND COMING BACK I'M SORT OF AND ANY SORT OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THERE IN WOULD DELAYED THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THEN I GET A TIME LINE FOR THAT AND THE EYES SORT OF PROCUREMENTS OR FACE TO OF THE PROCESS WHICH AGAIN. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN SPEAK TOO MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN MYSELF AND THAT IS ALL STRUCTURED AGAIN ON THE BASIS OF BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE THE RESULTS FROM THE FIELD TESTING. AND THEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ENSURE THAT WE CAN DEPLOY THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S PROCURED -- IN TIME FOR THAT FIGHT WILDFIRE SEASON IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND AND THE INTENT AND GOAL IS TO BRING FORWARD INFORMATION CONSISTENT WITH LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCESS ITSELF BUT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE -- AND ALSO NOTE THAT ANY ON GOING FUNDING COMMITMENTS -- WOULD HAVE TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SO THIS IS REALLY A ONE TIME FUNDING TO INITIATE THIS PROCESS THE OUTCOMES OF THAT PROCESS WILL ULTIMATELY BE BROUGHT FOR TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FUTURE. WELL WHETHER IT'S SO ONE TIME OR ONGOING WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND AS THE STAFFORD PORT TO WE HAVE A ONE CENT. SAYS STAFF COMMENT THIS PROCUREMENT PROCESS IS UNUSUAL AND MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT READ IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO EVALUATE ITS MERITS -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT HERE I APPROVE OF THE END. OF THE INTENT IT'S CLEARLY VERY IMPORTANT. YOU MENTIONED -- THIS IS ABNORMAL AND MORE IN THE NEW NORMAL THE WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY GET TO A POINT WHERE WE START TO ABUSE THOSE TERMS. BUT IN THIS NEW NORMAL WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BOTH ACCOMMODATE THE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY ON PROJECTS LIKE THIS. AND RESPECT THE ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE IN OVERSEEING BUDGET ITEMS LIKE THIS. SO THIS IS KIND OF A GOOD TEST CASE -- AND I THINK THE ALEJO HAS A PROPOSED SOME GOOD IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT -- IN IN THE FUTURE -- SO THAT WERE ABLE TO FULFILL ALL OF ALL OF THE ALL ALL OF OUR FUNCTIONS. AND TO DO APPROPRIATELY AND WHILE. MS GARCIA. THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT THE CHAIR HAS. MENTIONED WHEN I READ THIS I WAS IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THAT WE'RE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND THAT WE ARE LIVING AND TAKING THIS REALITY SERIOUSLY -- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IT IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER THAT THIS AND SUPERSEDES -- THE WITH THE VOTERS HAVE SENT US HERE TO DO. ALL ALONG THE WAY IN SUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO SEND THAT MESSAGE TO OUR GOVERNOR ALONG THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DO BOTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NOW WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE.

NINE TO PARKS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME TO CHECK ON GOOD TO SEE YOU BE BRIEF. MY NAME'S JEFF ON AMONG THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE YOU ASKED TWO QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. FIRST HOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT USE THE SEVENTY NINE POSITIONS. WE DIVIDE THEM AND WOULD SEND ABOUT THIRTEEN POSITIONS INTO OUR BIOLOGICAL AND SCIENCE COMPONENT OF OUR MULTI DISCIPLINARY EFFORT. EXCUSE ME FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS THAT WAY AND WE'D SEND ABOUT THIRTY TWO POSITIONS INTO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. WITH SPLIT THE TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THIS WAY. ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION WOULD SUPPORT THE SCIENCE SIDE. IN ABOUT TEN POINT FIVE MILLION WOULD SUPPORT THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE. THE SECOND QUESTION YOU ASK IS HOW WE COLLABORATE MY ANSWER IS VERY WELL. FROM COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSIONS THROUGH COUNTY SUPERVISORS THROUGH LOCAL SHERIFFS -- WE HAVE A SERIES OF MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE GUARD. AND WITH A VARIETY OF FEDERAL AGENCIES ALL OF WHICH ARE ABOUT COORDINATING ACTIVITIES. TO DEAL WITH TRESPASS ON PUBLIC LANDS AND ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION AT A CARTEL LEVEL. AND WITH THAT I WOULD TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LEASE MARKET -- DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION -- I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY TO COME TO DISTINGUISH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. FROM MY COLLEAGUE -- DIRECTOR BONHAM IS THAT THESE RESOURCES -- THE FIFTEEN POINT NINE MILLION THE FIFTY THREE POSITIONS WOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. ACRES OF STATE PARKS PROPERTY -- ALSO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION HAS DESIGNATED RESOURCES FOR THESE ACTIVITIES -- IN TERMS OF THE POSITIONS THAT WERE FILLING IT'S REALLY A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM IT'S A COMBINATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MAINTENANCE WORKERS TO FIGURE OUT THE TRAILS MOST OF THESE -- ILLEGAL GROWS THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE PAST OR IN SOME OF THE MOST REMOTE PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST ARCHEOLOGIST BECAUSE AS WE DO THE IMPORTANT RESTORATION WORK THAT'S NECESSARY HERE -- WE'RE GOING TO NEED A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES TO THE WATER SAID WHAT IT MEANS TO OUR REDWOOD FORESTS -- CULTURAL -- IN ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT THINGS AS WE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS A REBUILT -- I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT ALONG WITH -- I WOULD ECHO DIRECTOR BONHAM SENTIMENTS THAT I THINK WERE MOST SUCCESSFUL WHEN WE CONTINUE TO WORKING KEEP CLOSE OUR ALLIED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON THE FIELD -- AND WE ALSO EXPECT I EXPECT -- OUR TEAM AT PARKS TO CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE AND WORK WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TEAMS ARE COMMUNICATING DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES WE ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED OUR PROPOSAL PARTLY INFORMED BY. SOME OF THE EXPERTISE OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE THAT HAS -- KIND OF LEANED ON SOMEBODY'S GROWS IN THE PAST. AB SO THERE'S RELATIVELY LIMITED LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN THIS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE PROPOSITION WAS STRUCTURED THROUGH A HAVING A CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED FUNDS BUT I BECAUSE IT IS A BAD MAN NEW EFFORT AN EXPANDED EFFORT. WHENEVER WROTE -- RECOMMENDING FORMAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AT THIS POINT BUT IT IS SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS HAVING THAT APARTMENTS COME BACK AND EXPLAIN HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING WHAT'S AFFECTED HOW THEY'RE ADAPTING AND KIND OF A PRIMARY FOR LEGISLATIVE.

WHEN IT WAS ON THE BALLOT -- THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION THOUGH IS -- AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE MYSTICAL EXEMPTIONS I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT AND MAKING SURE NOT TO BROAD -- AS ALTERNATELY THAT MAY END UP HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO STAY TRUE TO THE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AND PUBLIC RESOURCE -- BENEFITS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO GET AT IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND HAVE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO ALIGN MY MY COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF BOTTOM LINE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

AND IT WAS CLEARLY. TAKING CARE OF THIS DAMAGE AND AND MAKING REPAIRS IS IS NEEDED AND AND IS A REASONABLE THING TO DO BUT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE LIST OF PROJECTS -- LINES UP WITH AND WITH WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE WITH WHITE AND FOLKS ARE GETTING FROM THERE THEIR DISTRICTS AND THAT THE COMMUNITY THINKS I'M IS A PRIORITY AS WELL. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE MAY REVISION AND WHILE THE DIRECTORS INDICATED THAT LIST OF PROJECTS IS FORTHCOMING AND THAT WITH LIMITED TIME THE SENATE YESTERDAY DID APPROVE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE -- REQUIRING THAT LATEST AD TO BE PROVIDED AND SO YOU MAY OR MAY WILL NOT WANT TO CONSIDER THAT JUST DEPENDING ON WHEN THE INFORMATION'S PROVIDED RELATIVE TO WHEN YOU BRING THIS ITEM BACK FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU -- I DON'T IMAGINE OF FINANCE AS A REPORT. THAT AND WHEN WE A MOVE ON TO ISSUED IN. NINETEEN NINE WATERCRAFT THIS GOT A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BUT HOPING YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DISTILL IT DOWN. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET ASSUMES THE RECEIPT OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION -- TO SUPPORT ITS VARIOUS PROGRAMS -- SINCE THAT TIME CONTROL AGENCIES HAVE REFINED THE FORMULA THAT DETERMINED -- THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE DEPOSITED INTO SOME OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IT WOULD BACK FILL THE REDUCTION OF THOSE FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT SPENDING PLAN AND THE COMMITMENT TO THE FIX OUR PARKS PROPOSAL THAT WAS. APPROVED BY THIS BODY LAST YEAR. GREAT LA A A A YOU HAVE A COUPLE COMEDY YEAH IT IS THIS IS SORT OF A VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION SO AND AS YOU'RE AWARE OF MISTER CHAIR. THAT IS STATE PARKS AND RECREATION IT FINDER SPUR AND HAD A LONG HAD SORT OF A HISTORY AS A FUNDING DOWN AND STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE FIND. ON THE SP ONE REVENUES THROUGH THE TRANSPORTATION AND FUNDING PACKAGE -- SOMEWHERE I EAT ADDRESS THAT TIME IS SHORT UP THE FIND AND ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINDS OUT FOR PARKS TO UNDERTAKE NEW ACTIVITIES AND INCLUDING WHAT WAS REFERENCE BY THE DOCTOR READY AND APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. I'VE AND FORTUNATELY THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT IS TO BE RECEIVED BY SPUR OF AS WELL AS THE HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT AND IT WAS. OVER ESTIMATED IN THE ACTUAL REVENUES AND THE RESERVE S. MEETING ERROR AND WHAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING RECEIVED BY THOSE PLANS IS SOMEWHAT LESS. ON THE PROPOSAL HERE FIRST BIRTH IS TO I'M SURE UP THE FRIEND I WITH THAT THIRTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME TRANSFER FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND THEN TO HAVE A NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUAL ON GOING TRANSFER FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES. THAT WERE AUTHORIZED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND RECOGNIZING THAT THAT'S A PARTY FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE APPROVED -- WOULD YOU JUST WANT TO FLAG FOR YOU IT IS ALSO AN OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT BRINGING DOWN THOSE EXPENDITURE LEVEL SOME WHITE IF YOU WANT TO BRING IT MORE IN LINE WITH WHERE THE ACTUAL REVENUES ARE. ESPECIALLY JUST GIVEN HOW RECENTLY AND THIS AUGMENTATIONS WERE MADE IN THE CURRENT YEAR I'M ALSO ONE OF FLAG FOR YOU ON THE HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT FIND AND THE PROPOSED SOLUTION HERE IS ONE TIME. AT THE END SO WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK WITH AN ON GOING SOLUTION TO THAT FINE AND NEXT YEAR AND IF THEY DO END UP GOING THE SAME APPROACH OF BACK FILLING WITH THE GENERAL FUND THEN YOUR GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT. COULD BE I'M COULD BE HIGHER -- AND THE SHORTFALL NOT FINISHED ACTUALLY LARGER THAN THE SHORTFALL ON THIS BIRTH. THANK YOU WILL TAKE THOSE COMMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION -- UP THAT HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- AS WITH THE OTHER TWO IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN SEEING NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ISSUES TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE ISSUE TWENTY IS THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMME. A GOOD MORNING -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR OF MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. AND RESPONSE PROGRAMS REQUEST THAT WE HAVE IS FOR ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SUPPORT OF SIX PROMINENT POSITIONS. TO ESTABLISH AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE UNIT WHICH IS NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE BOTH THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE NINE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD -- THERE NEEDED -- TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO DISASTERS MORE EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT ON GOING TO SASTRE RECOVERY EFFORTS. TO IMPROVE STATE COORDINATION AROUND PROTECTION OF DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND WATERSHED ON HEALTH AND ALSO TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY -- ENABLE US TO GO AFTER FEDERAL FUNDING FOR RECOVERY THANK YOU [inaudible] OHIO. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S -- THAN -- MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE INYO COUNTY PRIVACY DELEGATION REPLICATION. FULLER YES THANK YOU -- BUT SO YOU'LL KEEP IT SHORT YES I WILL -- SO. OUR PROPOSAL REQUEST THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWO POSITIONS FOR THE WATER BOARD TO ASSUME REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE FEDERAL SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT REQUIREMENTS IN INYO COUNTY -- IF THE WE GENERALLY IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO DELEGATE PRIMACY -- TO TO COUNTIES TO REGULATE SYSTEMS BELOW TWO HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS. BUT INYO COUNTY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE SO IN FEBRUARY -- TWO THOUSAND NINE THE WATER BOARD -- INFORM TO THE COUNTY THAT IT FAILED TO MEET REQUIREMENTS UNDER ITS DELEGATION AGREEMENT IT'S NOW BEEN REVOKED IF WE DON'T IF WE'RE DEEMED NOT TO BE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS BY USEPA IF IT JEOPARDIZES THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE AS A STATE. FOR OUR DRINKING WATER PROGRAM SO WE'RE REQUESTING THESE TWO POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE TAKING OVER THE THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF INYO COUNTY. THANK YOU IS -- LA A REPORT ON THIS -- IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS ISSUES TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE THERE ISN'T SO YOU'RE FREE TO GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING -- NEXT UP IS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. IF YOU'RE TWENTY TWO WILL TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT AGAIN AFTER ISSUE. TWENTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN LIMóN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M AT CHIANG MAI DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. SO WE HAVE TO MAY REVISED PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING TODAY BOTH OF THEM ADDRESS DIESEL POLLUTION WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF AIR TOXICS IN THE STATE. AND BOTH OF THEM ALSO INCLUDE FEE COMPONENTS TO ENSURE THAT AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR PROGRAMS WERE DOING SO IN A FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE AND PRUDENT MANNER. SO IN THIS FIRST PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU. WE'RE REQUESTING ONE POINT THREE TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND FOR SEVEN FULL TIME POSITIONS TO PERFORM APPROVALS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR. ON EXISTING REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SPECIFY THAT WE HAVE TO IMPROVE ZERO EMISSION OR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES PRIOR TO THEM BEING DEPLOYED. SO WE WANT TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE CERTIFY OR VERIFY THEM BEFORE WE SPEND MONEY ON THEM OR REQUIRE INDUSTRY TO USE THEM. IN THE PAST RITUALLY ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE CERTIFIED THEIR COMBUSTION ENGINES SO WHETHER THEY'RE IN CARS OR TRUCKS OR EQUIPMENT IT'S MOSTLY ENGINES. BUT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR PROGRAMS HAVE SHIFTED -- TO HAVE A GREATER INTEREST AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ZERO EMISSION AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO ESTABLISHED APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR THESE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND THIS VCP BASICALLY PROVIDES THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS -- INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IS IMPLEMENTED. THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND WOULD INITIALLY FUND THESE POSITIONS UNTIL FEES CAN BE COLLECTED TO PROVIDE ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM. AMBER REQUESTING THESE POSITIONS TO BEGAN IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY IN ADVANCE OF THE FEES BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WE WANT TO GET THIS EQUIPMENT OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE'VE GOT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUNNING AS WELL AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS -- YOUR BUILDING OUT A NEW TESTING FACILITY DOWN AND IS A POMONA IN RIVERSIDE REVERSED IN RIVERSIDE YES WE'RE BUILDING A NEW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERS AND AND WILL THIS -- TAKE PLACE IN THAT LOCATION OR WILL THEY BE HAD FOR MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING RELATED TO THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE ACTUALLY. CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE WOULD -- THAT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPER WOULD DO TESTING THEY FREQUENTLY A CONTRACT FOR THAT TESTING AND WE WORK WITH THEM OR ESTABLISH PROCEDURES ON THE KINDS OF TESTING THAT ARE DONE. AND THEN WE WOULD EVALUATE THAT TESTING SO IT'S MORE OF A PAPER EXERCISE THAN THINGS THAT WE'RE TESTING IN THE LAB AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TESTED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS IS. AND A NEW WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CONTROL EMISSIONS FROM SHIPS SO WHEN SHIPS COME IN AND WE DON'T WANT THEM TO RUN THEIR ENGINES BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY DIRTY SO WE LIKE THEM TO PLAY AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND OTHER THINGS SO FOLKS HAVE DEVELOPED A SYSTEM AND WE COLLOQUIALLY QUALITY THE BONNET. SO IT BASICALLY IS A BIG BONNET THAT SITS OVER THAT SINCE THE SMOKESTACK ON THE SHIP IN IT SUCKS UP THE EMISSIONS. SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THE TESTING FOR THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN OUR LAB IT HAPPENS ON SITE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PROCEDURES ARE CRACKED AND EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BEFORE HAND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- LA -- FINANCE. QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. NEXT ISSUE. OKAY SECOND ISSUE -- THIS IS FACE TO GREENHOUSE GASES WE'RE REQUESTING ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDS AND TEN POSITIONS PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS. TO REVIEW AND CERTIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ENGINES VEHICLES AND TRAILERS TO NEW FACE TO REGULATIONS -- YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED THAT THESE ARE THE SECOND PHASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WE ADOPTED IN COORDINATION WITH USEPA. AND THE STANDARDS GOING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY ABOUT A THIRD OF MY TWENTY FIFTY WHILE ALSO REDUCING SMOG FORMING AN AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS. SO THERE'S TWO MAIN REASONS WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THIS REGULATION THE FIRST IS THE ENGINES THATARE MEETING THE STANDARD ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE ENGINES MEETING THE PHASE ONE STANDARD. AND ARE STE OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA AND DOCUMENTATION HAVE INCREASED SO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE W. WITH FIAT CHRYSLER WERE. WERE AMPING UP WHAT WE WANT ON FROM FACE TO ALSO INCLUDES GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS FOR TRAILERS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE DEVELOPING NEW CERTIFICATIONS AT PROCESS FOR TRAILERS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED CERTIFICATIONS A YEAR. SO THE SECOND REASON THAT WE NEED MORE RESOURCES IS FOR THE PHASE ONE STANDARDS BASICALLY WE HAD A PROCESS THAT IF YOU COULD WERE CERTIFIED FOR U. S. E. P. TO USEPA WE DEEM DO YOU TO COMPLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. IN THE FACE TO PROGRAM WERE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATION IS IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN. AND SO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FOR THAT. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS B. C. P. IS THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW US TO COLLECT CERTIFICATION FEES. FOR ON ROAD VEHICLES AND ENGINES RIGHT NOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FINES THAT WE CAN COLLECT FOR OUR ON ROUTE CERTIFICATION ACTIVITIES IS CAPPED AT NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES IS IT REMOVES IS IT REMOVES THE CAP. IT ALLOWS US TO SET UP A SAYS FEES FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF TRAILERS. AND IT DIRECTS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE FEES TO A NEW FUNDS CALL THE CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE FUND. SO WITH THIS TRAILER BILL IS APPROVED WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS TO ESTABLISH FEES TO COVER THE FACE TO GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM. AS WELL AS UNDER ON ROAD CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS. ALL OF THESE RULE MAKINGS WOULD GO THROUGH OUR NORMAL PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND WE EXPECT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES COLLECTED TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH WHITE USEPA COLLECTS FOR CERTIFICATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU LA -- FINANCE NO COMMENTS QUESTIONS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE THERE IS NONE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION WILL HOLD THESE ITEMS OPEN. UP NEXT IS ISSUE TWENTY FOUR UNDER DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION REGULATION AND A DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS THERESA MARKS ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION -- WERE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT A PLAN THAT WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD AS YOU'RE MOST LIKELY AWARE -- THE KELLY K. SECRETARY AND CDFA SECRETARY ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CANCELING FOR PEER A FALSE WHICH IS A PRETTY WIDELY USED -- PESTICIDE HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT IT CERTAINLY HAS HEALTH PROBLEMS SO -- AS WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS AND WE BEGAN LOOKING AT MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THE NEED FOR LESS TOXIC A MORE SUSTAINABLE -- SAFER ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF THAT FOR THE GROWERS SO WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING TODAY IS MONEY TO SET UP -- DPR SPECIFICALLY IS REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- WITH THAT MONEY WE WANT TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT MONEY WOULD BE USED TO BEGIN -- SETTING UP A TASK FORCE A WORK GROUP IF YOU WILL. TO LOOK AT WHAT ALTERNATIVES -- ARE OUT THERE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE -- THAT HAVE EXPERIENCEIS NOT ONLY IN RESEARCH BUT ALSO IN THE APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES IN PEST MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES WE WANT TO HAVE A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF THAT WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE OF THE ART IS NOW OR THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE. WHERE ARE WE ON FLICKR FOSS ALTERNATIVES WORLDWIDE NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT WORLDWIDE AND HOW CAN WE BUILD ON THAT TO TRY TO BRING THE SITE FOR LESS TOXIC ALTERNATIVES? TO THE THE FIELD AND GET THEM THROUGH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS QUICKLY -- TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE THOSE ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE AND OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THOSE TYPES OF ALTERNATIVES WE BE LOOKING AT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES -- HOW CAN WE APPLY SAFER HOW CAN WE REDUCE THE TOXICITY BY -- BRINGING IN CERTAIN. THE SOIL -- MANIPULATIONS OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TO CUT DOWN THE TOXICITY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. SO THE OTHER TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR RESEARCH GRANTS AS YOU'RE AWARE WE HAVE CURRENTLY HAVE IN OUR BUDGET NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR RESEARCH GRANTS ON LESS TOXIC ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES THIS WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES. TO CORPORATE FOSTER -- WE HOPE THAT IF THIS IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTUALLY CONTINUING THAT YEAH IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. TO BE ABLE TO START LOOKING AT OTHER OF THE MORE TOXIC ALTERNATIVES WE ARE MORE TOXIC PESTICIDES WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN USE LIKE ORGANIC PHOSPHATES CORPORATE MATES -- PM AGAINST SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. AND ALL TURNED OUT FOR AND HAVE CDFA EXPLAIN THEIR PORTION. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KEVIN ALSO HARD DEPUTY SECRETARY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. IN AS ACTING DIRECTOR MARKS MENTIONED WE HAVE A COMPONENT HERE WE HAVE ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IN THERE WITH ME AS I EXPLAIN THIS AND THE REASON I DO THIS IS SO THAT YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF OTHERS MORE THAN JUST THIS REQUESTED FUNDING THAT GOES TO THIS ONE PARTICULAR COMPONENT. THE MILLION AND A HALF IS. A TO GO TOWARDS BRINGING MORE OF WHAT WE CALL AYE OR FOR PROJECTS INTO THE PIPELINE OTHERS A SEVERE BACKLOG RIGHT NOW OF THOSE PROJECTS THEY TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS TO COME TO FRUITION. AND FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR LAST YEAR YOU APPROVED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ON GOING FOR US TO START GETTING SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS MOVED ALONG OF WHICH WE'VE DONE -- FOR BUDGET YEAR AS PART OF THE PREVIOUSLY HEARD TECHNICAL BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS YEAH THAT WAS LIKE A PACKAGE DEAL REMEMBER THOSE FROM ABOUT A MONTH AGO. ONE OF THOSE PROPOSALS WAS FOR AG FENDER FORTY FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE DOING SOME OF THAT EFFORT. AND SO THIS MILLION AND A HALF AS PART OF THAT. AND SO -- WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT UP TOGETHER THEN THAT WOULD IN THIS IS ONE TIME THE MILLION AND A HALF WOULD RESULT IN US REALLY BEING ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH THAT LOG JAM TO GET A LOT OF THOSE PROJECTS MOVING ALONG? WITH THOSE PROJECTS TO DO IS IS THEY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FIELD LEVEL DATA WORKING COLLECTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN GET REGISTRATIONS. ON MATERIALS THAT ARE LESS IMPACTFUL THAN SOMETHING LIKE CLEAR PER OF US BUT WE'RE NOT SOLELY FOCUSED IN ON THAT THE I. R. FOR LOOKS AT A WHOLE WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS FOR SPECIALLY CROP GROWERS. IN THERE THE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE OF LOW AMOUNTS OF ACREAGE WHICH TRANSLATES INTO LOW AMOUNTS OF SELLABLE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS TYPICALLY DON'T WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND TIME TO REGISTER SOME OF THESE PROP PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH THESE PRODUCTS. ARE MORE OR LESS IMPACTFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT MIGHT EVEN BE MORE EFFICACIOUS TO THE GROWERS OF THE SPECIALTY CROPS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT MONEY'S GOING TO GO TOWARDS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO TWO MILLION GO TOWARDS BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS AND THAT SORT OF A RESURRECTION OF A PROGRAM THAT YOU SEE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION HAD ABOUT THOUGH IT DOESN'T -- SO MORE YEARS AGO WHERE THEY DID DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WITH GROWERS USING THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT IN INTEGRATED THAT INTO FARMING SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGY. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LOWER INPUTS AND USING. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES LIKE ENHANCED SCOUTING AND WITHHOLDING TREATMENT UNTIL CERTAIN THRESHOLDS ARE MET TO REDUCE OVERALL PESTICIDE USAGE. AS WELL AS THE LOWER FERTILIZER INPUTS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED -- MORE BENEFICIAL BUT YET GROWERS WOULD BE HESITANT BECAUSE THERE BE THE RISK OF YIELD LOSS OR NOT MAKING QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS. AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ARE A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DO THAT TO ROLL THAT OUT CLUB COOPER OF EXTENSION HAS AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF CROP ADVISORS. WHO ARE WELL POSITIONED TO FIND GROWERS WHO COULD HOST THOSE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN IT'S MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE THAN OTHER GROWERS SEE THAT? AND THAT'S REALLY HOW YOU SHIFT THE PARADIGM IN HOW GROWERS ADOPT CERTAIN PRACTICES. OF WHICH ALL THESE PRACTICES IN THE BIOLOGICAL INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS ARE CONSIDER VERY BENEFICIAL AND ALSO JUST YOU KNOW A LOT LESS HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT'S ALSO ONE TIME MONEY THANK YOU. THE COMMENTS ALL RIGHT. THEN THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ON BOTH OF THESE ISSUES IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS I OR ANYONE IS FROM SORRY -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. TWENTY FOUR GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RESERVE THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE CHECK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA FRESH FOR DISSOCIATION WESTERN ART PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION -- WE JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION -- FOR THIS FUNDING TO FIND ALTERNATIVES AND SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF GETTING SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVES INTO THE MARKET SO THAT GROWERS CAN BE USING I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF GROWERS AND GROWERS GROUPING REGISTRANTS IN THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE IT IS A GOOD PROCESS AND AND SHE WAS THE RESULTS. THAT EVERYONE WANTS -- SO WE JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND DEPARTMENT ASIDE REGULATION AND CDFA ON THIS PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SPEAKING IS -- SOMEBODY WHO IS -- VERY -- LONG TERM CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE HARM -- TO WILDLIFE AND TO HUMAN SO I FROM -- PESTICIDE USE THIS IS VERY OF WELCOME FUNDING AND TO ONE OF THE HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE A RAPID PROGRESS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THAT WILL TAKE US -- NOW -- TO OUR LAST APARTMENT APARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE YOU'RE GONNA STICK AROUND FOR FOUR MORE ISSUES. TWENTY FIVE THROUGH TWENTY EIGHT THE FIRST ONE IS -- RELATIVE TO PROP TWELVE IMPLEMENTATION. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON ITEM TWENTY FIVE OR ISSUE TWENTY FIVE FOR MENTAL CAN CONFINEMENT. IN THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION TWO LAST NOVEMBER ON FARM ANIMAL CONFINEMENT. WELL SORRY TWELVE GOT A MOMENT TO PROP TWO WAS YEARS AGO. SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S BEEN THAT MANY YEARS. WE'RE REQUESTING FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN ON GOING. AND FOURTEEN POSITIONS FOR THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION. TWELVE IN THIS MEASURE WHAT REQUIRES -- CERTAIN CONFINEMENT SPACE CONSIDERATIONS -- FOR POULTRY SWINE AND FEEL AND AND ALL OF DOCTOR JONES AND LET ME INTRODUCE DOCTOR JONES A STATE THAT MERION AND SHE'LL BE HERE FOR THE NEXT TWO ITEMS. AND THIS FALLS UNDER HER AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CHILLED DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM BY WHERE WE ALREADY DO SOMETHING KIND OF SIMILAR BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME IN THIS EXPANDS UPON THE REQUIREMENTS TO GET BROUGHT INTO THIS IN THE POULTRY SECTOR. AS FAR AS VERIFYING CAGE SIZES AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT -- BUT WHAT THE SIMILARITIES WHAT MAKES THIS KIND OF COMPLEX AND WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME REALLY EXPLAINING IT BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD BREAKTHROUGHS LATELY IN EXPLAINING IT IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC MANNER. THE PROPOSITION WAS WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT ALL THESE MEAT PRODUCTS. ARE REQUIRED TO THE ANIMAL SPACE CONFINEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE MET FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ME PRODUCTS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO TRADE CHANNELS IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY DRIVES THIS AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT IT. VERSUS JUST SIMPLY SAYING THAT IT'S A SIMPLE VERIFICATION OF WHAT'S HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S WHAT TURNED CALIFORNIA TRACED BACK THROUGH TRADE CHANNELS ESPECIALLY WITH SWINE -- SINCE THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ON THE FAILING OPERATIONS WHERE THE PIGLETS ARE PRODUCED BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHO FEEDS AND FIISHES THEM OUT IN ALTERNATELY PUTS HIM IN THE MARKET PLACE. SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE FAIRLY FAR REACHING AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE VERIFICATIONS. AND ALSO TO WRITE THE SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS AND TO HELL PROGRAMMATIC LEE OPERATE THIS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO DR JON STEAD DETAILS. THANK YOU. WELCOME SUGGESTED MAYBE. REITERATE IT USING SOME DIFFERENT WORSE AT TO WHAT KEVIN SAID BASICALLY THAT PROPOSITION ITSELF APPLIES TO COVERED ANIMALS WHICH IT LISTS WHICH WERE ALREADY MENTIONED. IN ON PRODUCTS FROM COVERED ANIMALS SO JUST TO REITERATE FOR SWINE FOR EXAMPLE IT COVERS A WHOLE RAW -- PARTS OF SWINE THAT ARE INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION PORK HORA PORQUE THAT'S INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. AND IN ORDER TO BE. SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THE TO PUT IT IN PRETTY SIMPLISTIC TERMS THEM THE MOTHERS OF THOSE ANIMALS THAT PRODUCE THAT MEET HAVE TO BEEN CONFINED IN A CERTAIN WAY WHICH REQUIRES REGISTRATION VERIFICATION OUT THE BREEDING BARNES INTO IT. WHEREVER THE ANIMALS ARE RAISED YEAH SAME FOR VEAL SAME FOR ACHES AND IT ALSO EXPANDS EGGS TO INCLUDE LIQUITEX [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. ISSUE. TWENTY SIX ISSUE TWENTY SIX MISSOURI WHERE WE HAVE A FOREIGN ANIMAL DISEASE CALLED. NEW CASTLE DISEASE THAT'S IMPACTING THE POULTRY INDUSTRY DOWN A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LARGELY THIS IS EXISTING IN BACKYARD POULTRY AND GAME FELL BREEDERS -- BUT IT HAS HIT SOME COMMERCIAL FACILITIES DOWN THERE THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE VERY DEVASTATING FOR CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE FOR A YEAR NOW IT STARTED IN MAY OF LAST YEAR. AND NEEDLESS TO SAY TO BE QUITE FRANK WE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST YEAR AND NOW THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GUIDED AND INFORMED US TO BE VERY SELECTIVE ON HOW WE CRAFTED THIS PROPOSAL. TO ASK FOR VERY SPECIFIC RESOURCES FROM THESE LESSONS LEARNED AS WE DO THIS AND WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN NEXT FEW MONTHS OF A RADIC HITTING THIS DISEASE -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK THAT WE NEED THESE RESOURCES THE SPECIFIC ONES FOR US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND DOING THE BEST WE CAN IN PREVENTING FUTURE DISEASES ARE NOT ONLY OF THIS ONE BUT OF SIMILAR TYPES OF DISEASES -- BUT ALSO SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A RAPID RESPONSE CAPABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THERE MORE QUICKLY THAN WE DID THIS TIME. AND EVEN TO SUSTAIN THAT PACING THAT QUICK PACE FOR A MORE SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE WE WORE OURSELVES OUT FRANKLY. AND THEN ALSO WITHIN THIS IS ANOTHER TEAM TO HELP US BETTER RESPOND TO ANIMAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE HAD CATASTROPHIC OF IT CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES OR FLOODS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF ANIMAL MOVEMENT DUE TO EVACUATION FOR JUST IMPACTS WITH PEOPLE BEING SEPARATED FROM ANIMALS REUNIFICATION IN CARE OF THEM DURING THE INTERIM TIME? AND WE ALSO. DID THE SENATE CERTAIN -- VERY DELIBERATE WAY BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES AND SPECIFIC TYPES OF RESOURCES TO HELP US BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT VENUES AND ALL A DOCTOR JONES AT SOME COMMENTS HERE. TO RIGHT SO THIS -- THIS PROPOSAL REFLECTS THAT GOT CONCEPT THAT WE SHARE WITH CAL FIRE ANOTHER FIRST RESPONDERS AND THAT WE DO TRY AND WELL WE TRAIN WE HAVE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HIGHLY SKILLED IN SPECIFIC AREAS WE ALSO TRYING TO MAINTAIN A ALL HAZARDS APPROACH SO IT'S ALL HAZARDS AS WITH REGARD. ANIMAL DISEASE AS WELL AS OTHER TO THE DISASTERS THAT CAN INFECT ANIMALS SO -- WE HAVE CLEAR NEED FOR THESE SPECIFIC SKILL SETS THE INTENTION AS WHEN WE SCALE UP TO RESPOND THESE WOULD BE THE LEADER SEIZE WOULD BE THE PEOPLE THAT INSURED ARE TEMPORARY HIRES ARE FOLLOWING. A BEST PRACTICES IT ALSO HELPS MAINTAIN BUT ALSO THEY COULD BE RE PURPOSED -- AS NEEDED TO ANY RESPONSE THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE. TWENTY SEVEN ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED -- TO FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP THEM BETTER COMPLY WITH THE PRODUCE SAFETY RULE WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- BUT THIS IS A HIGHLY INTEGRATED APPROACH HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE OUR DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WORKS IN UNISON WITH FTA TO IMPLEMENT THE FARMER THE PRODUCE SAFETY RULE ON THE FARMS AND WE MOST RECENTLY STARED INSPECTING SOME OF THESE FARMS. AND ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED NOT JUST VERY RECENTLY BUT AS WE'VE -- ON WROTE AND FOR ALL THIS PROCESS. IS IT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FARMS VERY DIVERSE BASE OF FARM SIZES COMPLEXITY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS GROWN -- THERE'S EVEN REGIONALLY SPECIFIC THINGS TO CREATE CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED FROM A FOOD SAFETY PERSPECTIVE. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS JUST THIS COMMON THREAD WOVEN THROUGHOUT ALL OF THAT THAT'S NEEDED OUT THERE TO HELP GET BETTER COMPLIANCE. BUT IF THE END OF THE DAY IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE BECAUSE A COMPLIANCE LEADS TO THE FOOD SAFETY EXPECTATIONS THAT -- THE PUBLIC EXPECTS OUT OF BEING ABLE TO GO IN AND BUY A THESE PRODUCE ITEMS. AND SO THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THIS REQUEST IS TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO GET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUT TO THE FIELD LEVEL. IN ALL INTRODUCED NATALIE CROP GREENBERGER'S DIRECTOR INSPECTION SERVICES AND SHE'S DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE RECENT OUTBREAKS AND ADMINISTERS THIS AND SHE CAN ADD A FEW COMMENTS. LINK GOOD MORNING THAT'LL CUT GREENBERGER Và SAYS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE TOOK ON THE ROLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO PERFORM THE INSPECTIONS FOR THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT AND AS A RESULT OF THAT AND ONE OF OUR LARGE TASKS WERE TO READY FARMERS FOR THE RULE AND THAT INCLUDED A TWO PHASE APPROACH TO FIRST WAS EDUCATIONAL. AND THEN THE SECOND IS INSPECTIONS AND SO THIS YEAR WE'VE STARTED OUR INSPECTIONS BUT FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS WE FOCUSED ON EDUCATION. AND LOOKING AT SURVEYS AND THE RESULTS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OUR FARMERS WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS LAW VIRTUALLY THERE IN NEED OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND IT'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SET CENTRIC TO THE RULE BECAUSE IT'S A PREVNTIVE RULES YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR FARM AND BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PRACTICES THAT -- ADDRESSING CONTROL RISK BUT THEN IT SECONDARY WHEN WE SEE THINGS LIKE OUTBREAKS AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON WHAT MEASURES CAN WE PUT IN PLACE THAT PREVENT THOSE THINGS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND LOOKS LIKE THAT WILL CONCLUDE -- HI THIS ITEM UNLESS THERE'S QUESTIONS FOR THE DICE. RIGHT OUR LAST ITEM IS ISSUE TWENTY EIGHT UNCLAIMED GAS TAX. HI THIS IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO A FOOD NAG CODE SECTION. TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT -- LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW UNCLAIMED GAS TAXES APPROPRIATED FOR USE FOR AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING LATE AND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN UP FOR AN AWFUL LONG TIME SO. UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY REQUEST THAT I CAN SAVE YOU THE WHOLE EXPLANATION IN THE HISTORY OF UNCLAIMED GAS TAX OR I CAN GIVE YOU THE THIRTY SECOND ELEVATOR -- THANK YOU ARE READ THE STAFF REPORT COLLEAGUES OKAY THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO REALLY IT IS JUST A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THE LA -- HAS NOTHING ELSE TO ADD. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT HELLO HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE LEARNED ON HE TOOK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL ON VARIOUS OTHER AG TRADE ASSOCIATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE LAST ITEM. I'M SORRY FOR UP NUMBER ISSUE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOSE FOUR ITEMS WILL BE HELD OPEN AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF OUR MEETING THERE. HAVE BEEN NO VOTE SO THERE WILL BE NO ADD ONS TO DO ONE AT YOUR GOOD. OF YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE THE MATTER THAT WE ADDRESSED ALL THAT YOU GUYS NEEDED IT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND SO -- OUR MEETING IS ADJOURNED THANK YOU
