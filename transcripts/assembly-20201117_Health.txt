HEALTH CARE CONCERT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IS BECOME MORE AND MORE PREVALENT THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND IN CALIFORNIA. WELL IT CAN PROVIDE FOR ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND COST SAVINGS FOR HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS. THE BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS ARE LESS CLEAR. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM ACADEMIC EXPERTS AND REGULATORS REGARDING THE CURRENT STATE OF INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION. REGULATORS ABILITY TO OVERSEE AND PREVENT OVER CONSOLIDATION. AND ISCO'S OPTIONS TO BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS FROMSOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF OVER CONSOLIDATION. SMIGEL THAT TODAY'S HEALTH INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL BASE OF INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION- DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS. REMOTELY TELL ME TODAY OKAY SO LET'S GO AHEAD. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS JAMIE KING. FROM OUR SAN FRANCISCO REMOTE TESTIMONY SITE. THANK YOU FOR BE WILLING AND WILLING TO GO TO THE SITE- MUCH APPRECIATED. PLEASE- PLEASE BEGIN. WELL GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD VICE CHAIRMAN MAYES AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HEALTH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON THE ISSUE OF CONSOLIDATION AND HEALTH CARE FOR ABOUT THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES I'LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION BOTH NATIONALLY AND WITH A FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA AND THEN LATER IN THE PANEL I'LL DISCUSS SOME POLICY OPTIONS FOR WHAT CAN BE DONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO BEFORE I GET TOO FAR INTO DISCUSSION I JUST WANT TO SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT BY ASKING WHAT IF THE PRICE OF FOOD INCREASED LIKE THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE HAD. UP BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND TWENTY NINETEEN SO UPDATED THESE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT. BUT BASICALLY IF THAT IF THE PRICE OF FOOD HAD INCREASED AT THE SAME RATE A DOZEN ORANGES WOULD COST. FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS IF YOU CLICK- A DOZEN EGGS WILL COST SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND A GALLON OF MILK WOULD COST A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS IF FOOD HAD INCREASED AT THE SAME RATE AS HEALTHCARE SO CLEARLY SOMETHING IS HAPPENING WITH OUR HEALTH CARE PRICES. AND THIS CAN ALSO BE SEEN IF WE- ADVANCE THE SLIDE. THIS CAN ALSO BE SEEN IF WE COMPARE. OUR PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THOSE OF OTHER NATIONS. OTHER NATIONS PAY A FRACTION OF WHAT WE DO. AND FOR THE SAME A GOODS AND SERVICES. OFTEN TIME OF EQUAL A BETTER QUALITY. AND SO IN FACT PRICES CLICK. ARE THE PRIMARY REASON WHY THE US SPENDS MORE ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. ADVANCE A SLIDE SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HEALTH CARE PRICES. WELL LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENED HEALTH CARE PRICES BUT IN THE REALM OF CONSOLIDATION COMPETITION THREE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPENED. THE FIRST IS THAT WE FAIL TO PROTECT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A FREE MARKET PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPETITION. SECOND WE FAIL TO RIGOROUSLY ENFORCE OUR ANTI TRUST LAWS. AND THIRD WE FAILED TO REGULATE WITH COMPETITION NO LONGER EXISTED NEXT SLIDE. SO LET'S START WITH PRICE TRANSPARENCY WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS SAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR HEALTHCARE WILL COST WE ALSO KNOW THAT ACADEMICS POLICY MAKERS AND ENFORCERS HAVE TROUBLE DISCOVERING THE PRICES THAT WE PAY FOR HEALTH CARE WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO REGULATE. IN FACT ADVANCE THE SLIDE. ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR STATES RECEIVED A FAILING GRADE ON THE STATE HEALTHCARE PRICE TRANSPARENCY TWENTY. BY CATALYST FOR PAYMENT REFORM. AND THE SOURCE ON HEALTHCARE PRICING COMPETITION SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD QUALITY PRICE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE- ON OUR HEALTH CARE IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO ENFORCE OUR ANTITRUST LAWS WITH MORE RIGOR WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THE FTC DID NOT BRING A SUCCESSFUL HOSPITAL MERGER CHALLENGE AND THIS DID TWO THINGS ONE IT HAD IT INSPIRED THE FTC TO SPEND VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES- CHALLENGING OTHER TYPES OF MERGERS AND IT SENT A MESSAGE TO THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY THAT THEY COULD CONSOLIDATE WITHOUT MUCH RECOURSE. AND SO WHAT I DID NEXT SLIDE PLEASE I WAS LEAD TO HEALTH CARE MERGER MANIA IN SOME SENSES SO WE THOUGHT HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH OTHER HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH OTHER HOSPITALS TO FORM HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. THOSE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THEN BEGAN ACQUIRING PHYSICIAN GROUPS- AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF ITS CROSS MARKET MERGERS WHERE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. IS ACQUIRING HOSPITALS AND PROVIDER GROUPS IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AND THE DATA ON WHAT HAPPENS FOLLOWING THESE MERGERS AND IS FAIRLY ROBUST ESPECIALLY IN THE REALM OF HORIZONTAL HOSPITAL MERGERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHEN WE HAVE HORIZONTAL HOSPITAL MERGERS THEY HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN PRICE FROM TWENTY TO FORTY FOUR PERCENT. REDUCTIONS IN QUALITY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. INCREASES IN PREMIUMS IN THE ACA MARKET REDUCTIONS IN WAGE GROWTH FOR BOTH NURSES AND PHARMACISTS. AND HIGHER COSTS OVERALL SO I KNOW THAT IN SOME INSTANCES HOSPITALS WILL CLAIM THAT THERE ARE- ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND EFFICIENCIES THAT COME FROM THESE MERGERS. BUT TO DATE. WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT LARGER HOSPITALS IN LARGER SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT HOSPITALS AND SMALLER SYSTEMS. ADVANCE ASIDE PLEASE. THE STORY IS MUCH THE SAME FOR VERTICAL MERGERS YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THE POSITION ENTITIES WHEN A HOSPITAL OR HEALTH SYSTEM ACQUIRES A PHYSICIAN PRACTICE- THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PHYSICIAN PRICES BY ON AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT. FOR SPECIALIST THOSE PRICES GO UP EVEN MORE SO CARDIOLOGISTS PRICES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE OF ABOUT 33% ORTHOPEDIST'S ARE ABOUT 12220% THE SAME IS TRUE IN CLINICS ARE REQUIRED BY HOSPITALS OR HEALTH SYSTEMS THEIR PRICES HAVE BEEN SEEN TO GO UP 322407% WITHIN FOUR YEARS. BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IT'S NOT JUST THE ACQUIRED ENTITY WHOSE PRICES GO UP WE ALSO SEE THE HOSPITAL'S PRICES IN THE ACQUIRING ENTITIES PRICES GO UP AS WELL. OFTENTIMES THESE MERGERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LITTLE TO NO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. AND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT VERTICAL ERGERS ARE OFTEN. JUSTIFIED AND ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH ON THE PROMISE OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES. AND THOSE PROMISES HAVE JUST NOT BEEN MET. AND NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN GENERAL AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO RAISE HERE FOR YOU IS THAT. THE FEDERAL FILING THRESHOLD OF FOR MERGERS UNDER THE HART SCOTT RODINO ACT IS NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. NOW THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL MERGER THE MEDIAN HOSPITAL MERGER IS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE IF FOR A HOSPITAL AND MURDER TO BE VALUED AT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS MEANS THAT NECESSARILY A PHYSICIAN GROUP MERGER IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE UNDERNEATH THAT AS WELL WHICH MEANS TAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION ESPECIALLY IN THE VERTICAL AREA IS FLYING UNDERNEATH FEDERAL ANTI TRUST ENFORCEMENT RADAR IT'S NOT BEING PICKED UP WHICH MEANS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR STATES TO BE PLAYING HERE IN MONITORING- CONSOLIDATION IN THESE. AREAS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO THE OTHER THE LAST YEAR I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS CROSS MARKET MERGERS AND THESE HAVE BEEN OCCURRING- IN LARGER NUMBERS IN RECENT YEARS AND THEY ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PRICES BY THE ACQUIRED HOSPITAL WE SEE THESE INCREASED PRICES OF 7217% AND INTERESTINGLY ONE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT OTHER RIVAL HOSPITALS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS THE HOSPITAL THAT WAS ACQUIRED ALSO INCREASE THEIR PRICES BY CLOSE 28% JUST SHADOWING THE PRICE INCREASE OF THE- ACQUIRED HOSPITAL SO THE EFFECT IS. PERVADING OUT THROUGHOUT THE MARKET IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND SO ALL THIS CONSOLIDATION- HAS AFFECTED THE UNITED STATES HEALTHCARE MARKETS VERY BROADLY IT'S NOT JUST HOSPITALS THAT WE'RE SEEING SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS. THESE ARE PERCENTAGES OF OUR METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS SO. THESE ARE METRO AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES 95% OF THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED HOSPITAL MARKETS. ALMOST 80% OF THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED A SPECIALIST PHYSICIAN MARKETS NEARLY 60% OF THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. INSURER MARKETS. AND OVER 40% OF THEM HAVE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MARKETS AND I REALLY WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE THAT HAS INCREASED. A HUNDRED AND TEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THIS IS A MARKET TO REALLY WATCH ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVE IT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES HAVE BEGUN TO STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE NOT GOING TO THE DOCTOR AS MUCH. DURING COVERT AND THAT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO ACQUISITION IN THE FUTURE SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE. PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW CONSOLIDATION IS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE LOOKED AT SORT OF THE NATIONAL NUMBERS ON THIS BUT HOUSES AFFECTING CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR. WELL THE MOST RECENT DATA THAT I COULD GET WAS FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS IS FROM THE PATRIS CENTER. AND WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT OUR HOSPITAL MARKETS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- AT LEAST IN THE TOP. TWO THIRDS OF IT OR THREE QUARTERS OUR V&lt;c.cyan&gt; ARE HIGHLY&lt;/c&gt; CONCENTRATED. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR INSURER MARKET THEY'RE ALL HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MARKETS ARE MUCH LESS SO- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- BUT THEY ARE RAPIDLY CONSOLIDATING ON WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THEY HAD OF MANY OF THOSE MARKETS AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAD HIGHER ACQUISITION AND HAD HIGHER H. I. CHANGES. OF FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR SPECIALIST POSITION MARKET CONCENTRATION THAT THOSE HAVE. BEEN HIGHLY CONCENTRATED ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHANGE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- MARKETS ARE HIGHLY ARE CONSOLIDATING AT A RAPID RATE AS WELL. I'M SO OVER. NEXT IS. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT- THE WHOLE STATE IS CONSOLIDATING KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD IN ITS HEALTH CARE MARKETS BUT WE SEE MORE ACTIVITY WITH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND MORE CONSOLIDATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND AS CONCENTRATION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AS CONCENTRATION INCREASES SO DO PRICES SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT HOSPITALS IN THE LARGEST SYSTEMS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHARGE HI SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES AND THOSE RATES ARE INCREASING AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE REST OF THE OTHER HOSPITALS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW ON THIS SIDE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS BOTH THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL MARKETS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE MARKETS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE OUTLIER GROUP- WHERE THERE'S JUST THREE LITTLE MARKETS THAT ARE THERE SOME STANDING SIDE ON THE RED. YOU CAN SEE THAT SAN JOSE HAS THE HIGHEST OVERALL PRICES AND IN HEALTHCARE IN THE COUNTRY. SAN FRANCISCO IS HAS THE LITTLE WHITE LINES ACROSS IT AND IT'S NUMBER TWO. AND IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA IS THE THIRD IN THAT GROUP AND ITS NOTORIOUSLY HAS VERY HIGH PRICES BECAUSE IT'S SO REMOTE. NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT THE LITTLE RECTANGLE THAT'S BRIGHT ORANGE THAT'S LOS ANGELES AND ITS PRICES ARE 19% ABOVE THE NATIONAL MEDIAN. SO IT IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE BUT IT IS ALSO HAS ELEVATED PRICES COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THIS WHAT I WANT YOU TO SEE HERE AND THE SIDES ARE FROM AND- THE HEALTH CARE COST. INSTITUTE A THEIR PRICE INDEX AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS I THINK VERY USEFUL SO I'VE COMPARED. PRICES IN OVERALL SPENDING IN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES NEW YORK AND SAN JOSE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT. OVERALL SPENDING IN SAN FRANCISCO IS VERY SIMILAR INTERNET AS IT IS IN NEW YORK. BUT WHAT'S DRIVING THAT IS DIFFERENT AND SAN FRANCISCO WHAT'S DRIVING THAT- THAT SPENDING IS PRICES WE PAY SIXTY FOUR. PERCENT OVERALL MORE THAN THE NATIONAL MEDIAN WEARING AS IN NEW YORK THE P. 19% MORE OVERALL BUT THEY HAVE HIGHER UTILIZATION WE HAVE A WE USE LESS CARE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND OUR SERVICE MAKES. IT HEALTHIER AND SO REQUIRES LESS CARE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. IN SAN JOSE THE STORY IS LARGELY THE SAME IN LOS ANGELES THEIR RICES ARE 19% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT AGAIN THEIR UTILIZATION AND SERVICEMAX. ARE BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SO IT'S ARGUES. AND THE HEALTHINESS OF OUR POPULATION THAT IS HELPING TO BRING OUR PRICES ARE SPENDING DOWN BUT OUR PRICES THAT ARE DRIVING IT UP. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SAME- PATTERN EMERGES AND EVEN MORE SO WHEN IT COMES TO INPATIENT SPENDING. OUR INPATIENT SPENDING IS 26% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BETTER PRICE FOR INPATIENT SPENDING. IS CLOSE 290% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AGAIN OUR UTILIZATION IN SAN FRANCISCO IS DOWN FOR LOS ANGELES OUR PRICE IS 34% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT UTILIZATION IS 22% BELOW- SO THESE ARE JUST WAYS OF HELPING TO SHOWHOW MUCH PRICES DRIVING THE AMOUNT SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE IF YOU LOOK AT OUTPATIENT SPENDING- YOU'LL SEE THAT THE PATTERN IS MUCH THE SAME BUT SAID I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO SAN JOSE IN THIS PICTURE SAN JOSE SPENDS ABOUT THE NASA. IS SPENT ABOUT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ON OUTPATIENT SPENDING BUT ITS PRICE IS A HUNDRED AND 4% OVER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND ITS UTILIZATION IS 46% LESS SO WE ARE USING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS OUTPATIENT CARE. AND THE FEAR IS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE OF THE PRICE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- IN TERMS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGAIN WE SEE VERY HIGH PRICES OF MINIMAL LEVELS OF UTILIZATION ARE SORT OF AVERAGE AT LEVELS OF UTILIZATION- BUT STILL PAYING MUCH MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE LOS ANGELES HAS LOWER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PRICES JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- BUT AGAIN LOWER UTILIZATION SO THAT'S BRINGING THOSE PRICES DOWN. OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO WHEN OUR PRICES ARE SO HIGH I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PUT IN CONTEXT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT AS PROVIDER PRICES INCREASED INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL PASS THOSE RATE INCREASES ONLINE THROUGH PREMIUMS TO EMPLOYERS AND TO INDIVIDUALS. AND OFTENTIMES THOSE EMPLOYERS THEN SHIFT THE COST ON TO EMPLOYEES. AND IT'S ASKING THEM TO PAY HIGHER PART HIGHER PORIONS OF THEIR PREMIUM AS WELL AS HIGHER OUT F POCKET COSTS. AND SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AS A FAMILY PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED OVER NINE TO ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AND FAMILY WORKER CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE INCREASED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT- TO. OVER FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AS A RESULT OVER 60% OF AMERICANS HAVE AS A MAJOR CONCERN THAT THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN WILL ASK THEM TO PAY A GREATER AMOUNT IN PREMIUMS OR GREATER PORTION OF THEIR MEDICAL EXPENSES AND ALMOST HALF OF THEM SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTH CARE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT HAPPENS THIS IS NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO INSURANCE OR UNDER INSURED THIS IS HALF OF THE PEOPLE WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE SAY THAT SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY SKIPPED NEEDED OR RECORD NEEDED CARE OR POSTPONED IT DUE TO COST. IN THE LAST YEAR. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INDIVIDUALS CAN'T AFFORD THEIR HEALTH CARE IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAMILY FINANCES AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE IT ALSO AFFECTS THE OVER ARCHING ECONOMY WE SEE THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE HIGH HEALTH CARE BILLS THEY PUT OFF VACATIONS AND MAJOR PURCHASES THEY CUT SPENDING ON FOOD AND CLOTHES AND HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. THEY TAKE OUT MORE DEBT BAY INVEST LESS IN THEIR RETIREMENT OR THEY PULL MONEY OUT OF THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS- THEY CHANGED THEIR LIVING SITUATION THEY EITHER SELL THEIR HOME THEY MOVE OUT OF STATE THEY DO OTHER THINGS SO THE IMPACTS OF HEALTH CARE NOT JUST ON OUR EMPLOYERS AND OUR CITIZENS THEY AFFECT THE ENTIRE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO DO AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SO I'M GONNA STOP HERE M. NEXT SLIDE AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE AT THE END. OF THE HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE WITH THIS ANY QUESTIONS. AT THIS POINT. OUR FIRST OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THAT OVERVIEW AND- SOME OF THE STATE'S PRETTY STAGGERING STATISTICS THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT THERE. WHEN I GO BACK AND- TO A COMMENTED SHE MADE- OR WHEN YOU'RE THEIR SLIDES WE TALKED ABOUT- IT'S A NEW YEAR UNDER THE VERTICAL- VERTICAL INTEGRATION OR VERTICAL- MERGER. PROCESSES THAT ARE GOING ON THERE HE NOTED THAT- YOU KNOW EVEN THE ACQUIRING HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE SHOWING HIGHER PRICES SO IS- IS PART OF THAT THE DEBT MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUISITION. OF THAT OR IS IT. IS IT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY- TO CHARGE MORE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW THE BIG DOG IN TOWN. SO MMHM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT WHAT LARGELY IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE IS A MARKET POWER GAINED BY ACQUIRING A DESIRABLE PHYSICIAN GROUP IN THAT SPACE AND THEREFORE THE HOSPITAL THEN HAS AB IMPROVED MARKET POWER POSITION VIS A VIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURERS. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES NOW IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SOME OF THAT INCREASE IN PRICES DUE TO DEBT MANAGEMENT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE THINGS WERE CONTROLLED FOR AND THAT IN GENERAL THE PRICE INCREASES ARE DUE TO- TO COMPETITION AND ADVANCES AND MARKET POWER- SO AND THEN AND THEN YOU HAD ANOTHER SLIDE ON. ON OUTPATIENT CENTER- SPENDING AND ONCE AGAIN SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY STAGGERING THAT OBVIOUSLY PRICES A HUGE HUGE COMPONENT. OF FOR EXAMPLE THE IN SAN FRANCISCO AT SOME. PRICE BEING 72% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN SAN JOSE A HUNDRED AND FOUR PERCENT- OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND WHAT YOU SAID WAS- YOU ALSO SEE LOWER UTILIZATION SO PRICE. IS DRIVING THAT LOWER UTILIZATION- FERRIS FAIR TO SAY. SO I THINK THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN A STUDY DO DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PRICE IS DRIVING THAT UTILIZATION IT CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED HERE- BUT I NOTE WEEK WE DO SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE FORGOING CARE THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES DEMONSTRATING THAT I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT TIED SPECIFICALLY IN THE YOU KNOW SAN JOSE OR SAN FRANCISCO BUT IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT IF THE PRICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WE SEE SOME. WE SEE SIGNIFICANT LOWER UTILIZATION THAT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING AND SEEKING CARE BECAUSE OF PRICE AND THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CONCERN THAT WE WOULD SEE IN THIS. IN THIS SITUATION. SO AS WE SEE- AS WE SEE THESE. THESE TRENDS- IS. IS PART OF THE- YEAH I DO WONDER IF THERE'S AT THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG OR SOMETHING GOING ON HERE BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THESE SYSTEMS HAVE- HAVE. OVERHEAD AND COSTS AND SO- YOU KNOW IS LOWER IS THERE YOUR LOWER UTILIZATION. IN GENERAL AND THEN THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE TO KEEP THE REVENUE UP OR OR IS THE REP YOU KNOW ARE THERE ANY STUDIES SHOW THAT THE REVENUE. ARE THE PRICES IS AFFECTING YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITHOUT QUESTION. I DO SO I THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL THESE ARE THESE ARE URBAN CENTERS. AND SO IN URBAN CENTERS THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE AND THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A NEED TO GENERATE CARE TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN IN RURAL CENTERS WE SEE A LOT MORE OF THAT WHERE. JUST KEEPING THE HOSPITAL GOING REQUIRES- YOU KNOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO COME IN THE DOOR AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE A POPULATION- SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF CARE BUT IN URBAN CENTERS I THINK THAT'S MUCH LESS OF A CONCERN. SO WERE ALSO SEEN- WITH THESE WITH THESE INCREASED COSTS AND PRICES- AND THE CONSOLIDATION AROUND. IN THE MARKET PLACE- IS CERTAINLY IN AREAS YOU KNOW AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE. MAJOR DOMINANT PLAYERS AND SO. ON SO THAT. IN TURN LEADS TO HIGHER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM COSTS BECAUSE OF NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. YEAH I BELIEVE AND THAT MAKES ME MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT SO PART OF THE INSURANCE COSTS OR THE RIVER PREMIUMS IS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE- THE BIGGER SYSTEM THAT IS THE DOMINANT SYSTEM IN THE AREA. KNOWS THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR THEIR PLANNED SO- THERE IS IT IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S ALL FEEDING ITSELF HERE AND THE CONSUMER IS THE ONE WHO WAS IS SUFFERING. YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT SO WEEK- WE CALL THAT HAVING A MUST HAVE HOSPITAL OR MUST HAVE PROVIDER WHERE NETWORK ADEQUACY LAWS OR PATIENTS DEMANDED THAT A CERTAIN PROVIDER BE IN A NETWORK- THIS OFTEN HAPPENS BECAUSE OF NETWORK ADEQUACY LAWS IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S ONE HOSPITAL AND A GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND SO- IN THOSEINSTANCES PROVIDERS THAT HAVE THOSE MUST HAVE HOSPITALS NOT ONLY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR PRICES UP TO MONOPOLY LEVELS AND- FOR THOSE HOSPITALS BUT AS WE SAW- IN THE SUTTER CLIP IN THE SUTTER HEARING- THOSE ARE OFTEN ALSO LEVERAGE TO- DRIVE UP PRICES IN OTHER HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES THAT ARE IN. MORE COMPETITIVE MORE COMPETITIVE MARKETS AND SO IF YOU CAN THROUGH THE USE OF ALL OR NOTHING CLAUSES WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER- THOSE ENTITIES WITH MUST HAVE PROVIDERS CAN THEN. LEVERAGE THOSE PRICES AND THAT MARKET POWER TO DRIVE UP PRICES IT FOR ALL OF THEIR PIC AT PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A TO OPEN UP- MISTER NAZARIAN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AREAS HERE DO YOU WOULD YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR FIRST SPEAKER. AT THIS POINT OKAY WELL THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO OUR THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION AND LATER PART OF OUR OUR HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GONNA GO TO OUR NEXT OF OUR SECOND PANEL ON CONSISTS OF OUR STATE. STATE REGULATORS. FIRST FROM THE WITH VIDEO WITNESS VIDEO ROOM IN THE CAPITAL WE HAVE A RUNNING COULD GEORGE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE EFFORT TO BE HERE TODAY AND- PLEASE. GO AHEAD. STE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M RUNNING TO GEORGE THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE HEALTHCARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS SECTION WE ARE A NEWLY CREATED SECTION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE COORDINATES AND LEADS ALL HEALTH CARE WORK FROM HOSPITAL TRANSACTIONS TO ANTI TRUST AND CONSUMER ISSUES IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. AS PART OF OUR NEW EXPANSION OUR SECTION REVIEWS NONPROFIT HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS TO STUDENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY UNDER CORPORATIONS CODE SECTIONS. FIFTY NINE FOURTEEN TO FIFTY NINE AT TWENTY SIX AND LEADS NEW MATTERS INVOLVING HEALTHCARE CONSOLIDATION AND COMPETITION ISSUES- WITH THE WITH THE AD DOJ'S HISTORY OF REVIEW OF HEALTH CARE FACILITY TRANSACTIONS AND EXPERTISE IN ANTI COMPETITION CONDUCT IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD FROM THE SENATE LITIGATION IT TO PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG PRICING IN THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT. TO NAME A FEW. THE OF JUST IS YOU SITUATED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CON A CONSOLIDATION IN HEALTHCARE. SO TODAY I WILL BE GIVING YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY. AND WHERE THERE ARE POTENTIAL GAPS IN THE EXISTING OVERSIGHT. THE BEGINNING FIRST WITH OUR AUTHORITY CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW. AND CONSENT FOR ANY SALE TRANSFER AT LEAST EXCHANGE OPTION CONVEYANCE OR OTHERWISE DISPOSABLE OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS OF THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY OWNED OR OPERATED BY NONPROFIT CORPORATION. THIS LAW WAS THE PRODUCT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER TO EXPAND THE AG'S REVIEW OF NONPROFITS AND HEALTH CARE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN A HOSPITAL BENEFITTED. FROM NONPROFIT STATUS THE COMMUNITY BENEFITED AS WELL. THIS REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO ALL NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AS DEFINED IN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION TWELVE FIFTY. I SUCH AS THAT ARE LICENSED TO PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE SO THIS INCLUDES FOR INSTANCE- GENERAL KEEP IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT I'M RESIDENTIAL CARE ENTITIES. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS OPPOSITION GROUPS OTHER CLINICS OR LABS OR OUTPATIENT SETTINGS LIKE AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS. UNDER THE CORPORATION'S FLOAT. THE HEALTHCARE ENTITY HAVE AT HAS TO GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE NOTICED AND THEN WE HAVE NINETY DAYS TO REVIEW THE TRANSACTION GIVE CONSENT CONDITIONAL CONSENT OR TO DENY THE AGREEMENT OR TRANSACTION. HI THIS TIME THREE MAY ALSO BE EXTENDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE DAYS. WHEN REVIEWING THESE TRANSACTIONS THE AG MUST EXAMINE CERTAIN FACTORS INCLUDING WHETHER THAT THE FOR THE TERMS ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE- WHETHER THAT THE TRANSACTION IS THAT A FAIR MARKET VALUE. WHETHER IT IMPROPERLY BENEFITS ANY PRIVATE AND FIFTY. FOR INSTANCE I'M WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE TRANSACTION AFFECTS THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCLUDING WHETHER THE TRANSACTION RAISES COMPETITION CONCERNS OR IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AFTER THE REVIEW AS I SAID THE AG MAY CHOOSE TO APPROVE CONDITIONALLY APPROVE OR DENY THAT TRANSACTION IN A CONDITIONAL APPROVAL THE AGING MAY REQUIRE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST INCLUDING REQUIRING THAT THE MERGED ENTITY'S. MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CHARITY CARE SERVICES OR INCREASE CHARITY CARE- JERRY CARE PROVIDES FREE CARE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED OR PRESERVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN SERVICES SUCH AS EMERGENCY SERVICES. WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEONATAL SERVICES AND OTHER ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO NAME A FEW. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN- WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE DIGNITY HEALTH CARE MERGER WITH CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE. THE EACH YOU REQUIRE THAT THE NEWLY FORMED AT SYSTEM PROVIDE ADD DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP 2210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND TO MAINTAIN EMERGENCY AND WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR TEN YEARS. AND REQUIRED PUBLIC ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE IF REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES. WERE DISCONTINUED AFTER THIS TIME. I REVIEW PROCESS AND A PUBLIC MEETING TO HEAR COMMENTS FROM THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY- WE ALSO SOLICIT COMMENTS ON OUR WEBSITE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. DOCTORS PATIENTS AND I AM PLEASE ELECTED OFFICIALS ADVOCATES AND OTHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS OR TRENDS THAT I'M TRANSACTIONS AND ATTEND THE PUBLIC MEETING. THIS HELPS INFORM OUR WORK THE REVIEW PROCESS ALSO INVOLVED WHEN NECESSARY PREPARATION OF INDEPENDENT HEALTHCARE IMPACT REPORTS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE TRANSACTION MAY CREATE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AVAILABILITY ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY. INCLUDING COMPETITION CONCERNS AFTER THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN APPROVED FACILITY OR HOSPITAL MAY REQUEST A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IMPOSED THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED CONDITION IF THERE'S AN UNFORESEEN CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE AT THE FACILITY OR SYSTEM. JUST OUTLINED. TIME TO GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WILL HAVE REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY ONE NEW HOSPITAL TRANSACTION AND THREE NEW CONTINUING CARE FACILITIES OPERATING A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY I IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOSPITAL TRANSACTIONS- AND ONE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OPERATING A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT SOME TRANSACTIONS- LIKE THE VERY TRANSACTION FOR INSTANCE. TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS TO RESOLVE. OKAY SO NOW THAT I HAVE DISCUSSED. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY I'M GONNA TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GAPS IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REVIEW AUTHORITY. WHILE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE AUTHORITY UNDER CORPORATIONS CODE SECTION FIFTY NINE FOURTEEN TO FIFTY NINE TWENTY SIX. IT STILL HAS A LOOK AT IT STILL LIMITED TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. AS SUCH ONLY PORTION OF THE HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA EVER REVIEWED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. ONLY THE LARGEST MERGERS ARE EVER REVIEWED BY THE FTC LEAVING MANY TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT. I BOUGHT THIS ONE OF THE- IS THAT MANY TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS ESCAPE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REVIEW. ONCE THEY DO NOT GET OVERSIGHT INCLUDE. TRANSACTIONS ONLY INVOLVING FOR PROFIT PROFIT CORPORATIONS WHICH INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS HEDGE FUNDS AND FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS- TRANSACTIONS IN INCLUDING THAT INVOLVING THE PURCHASE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES INCLUDING PHYSICIAN GROUPS. OTHER CLINICS OR LABS OUTPATIENT SETTINGS LIKE AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS AMONG OTHERS. I'M HAS PROFESSOR KING NOTED- THIS IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE SEE THIS AS A DRIVER OF COSTS AT. ONE OF THE STATE WAS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT PRICES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ACQUIRED POSITIONS INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF 14% POST ACQUISITION. OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT REVIEWED BY THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS BOB I PUBLIC ENTITY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC HOSPITALS TEN TRANSACTIONS WHERE AT AND THEN IT TRANSACTIONS THAT WHETHER NONPROFIT FACILITY HAS DECLARED BANKRUPTCY CREATE A SPECIAL. UNIQUE PROBLEM M. BECAUSE THERE'S A NATURAL TENSION BETWEEN THE GOALS OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE AG TO PRESERVE THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO WE HAVE. WE'VE SEEN IN IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS THAT. THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO OUR ABILITY TO IN IMPOSE CONDITIONS. I'M I'M ANOTHER SHORTCOMING IS THE LACK OF NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HI THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RETAINS THE AUTHORITY TO CHALLENGE ANY ANTI COMPETITIVE HEALTH CARE MERGER WE HAVE ESTABLISHED EXPERTISE IN REVIEWING THESE TRANSACTIONS FROM A COMPETITION PERSPECTIVE I'M CHALLENGING AND TAKE ON. COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS AND BRINGING CASES LIKE SATURDAY TO CHALLENGE ANTI COMPETITIVE CONDUCT HOWEVER THE MORE EFFECTIVE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE AG RECEIVED PRIOR NOTIFICATION OF ALL RELEVANT HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS WITH SUFFICIENT TIME TO REVIEW AND APPROVE THEM. I'M AS SHOCKED AS A PROFESSOR CAN NOTICE- PRODUCT PROBLEMATICALLY UNDER THE HART SCOTT RODINO NOTICED THERE FILL THE AGL ONLY RECEIVED NOTICE OF QUITE LARGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SMALLER MERGERS ARE THEY DON'T ACCEPT CASH HOLD OR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING HEALTHCARE FACILITIES FOR PROVIDERS LIKE AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS OUTPATIENT CLINICS PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND LAST. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE RARELY REACH THE PRE MERGER REVIEW THRESHOLD FOR REVIEW BY FEDERAL TO GO REGULATORS SO CONDUCT CONSOLIDATION MAY OCCUR. WITHOUT FEDERAL OR STATE OVERSIGHT. I A RESULT OF THIS CONSOLIDATION IT- IT IS K. REGULAR SCRUTINY WHILE STILL IF MARKET POWER AND HEALTH CARE PRICES. SO. CURRENTLY THE EIGHTY TWENTY GENERAL MUST RELY OTHER MEANS LIKE A NEW REPORTS ANOTHER SOURCES TO TRACKING CALL OF FOR HOSPITALS IN PHYSICIANS. OR OTHER HOW CARE IF IT'S- AS A RESULT OF THE AGES OFF MAY BE ON OF THE TRANS IN THEREFORE I TO IT AFTER IT COMPLETED- IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT US TO ON. IT THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED WHICH IS INCREASES THE IMPORTANCE OF CREEK TRANSACTION REVIEW BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I'M ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BOTTOM GRATIFICATION IS THE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING A TRIP. IN CHALLENGING A TRANSACTION AFTER THE FACT. WITHOUT PROPER NOTIFICATION THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO ENGAGE IN AN INVESTIGATIVE ANALYTICS AND LITIGATION PROCESS THAT IS ARGUE IT. OUT WITH THE END RESULT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN ON THE OUTCOME DEPENDS ON THE INDICATIVE. IS THAT THE JUDGE WAS IN MAKING INDEPENDENT DECISIONS BASED ON CASE LAW. RATHER THAN DEPENDING ON THE AGENCY THAT HAS BUILT UP EXPERTISE OVER TIME AS WAS INITIALLY ENVISIONED. ON FURTHER UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THE AGL HAS THE ABILITY TO I'M I'M DO YOU. MURDERS RETROACTIVELY TRANSACTION RETROACTIVELY ONLY IF WE SEE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON ONCE THEY MANIFESTED THEMSELVES AT WHICH TIME IT MAY BE DIFFICULT. TO UNSCRAMBLE THE EGG SO TO SPEAK. ALBUM IS WORSENED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS BUYING ONE YOU KNOW POSITION GO BETTER TIME TO MARKET IS MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK AND DO. SO IN CONCLUSION WHILE THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL'S OFFICE THIS CURRENT ORDER ALLOWS FOR OVERSIGHT OF NONPROFIT HEALTH HOSPITAL TRANSACTIONS MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT WHICH LEAVES A GAP AND IN BALANCE AND OVERSIGHT. AND THE LACK OF NOTIFICATION. REQUIREMENTS OF ANYTHING BUT VERY LARGE TRANSACTIONS ARE HOW THE CURRENT LAW IS APPLIED TO ONLINE CONTRACTS AND TRANSACTIONS ONLY AFTER THERE'S AN ACCUMULATED NEGATIVE ANTI COMPETITIVE THE FAX. AND THE DIFFICULTY IN BRINGING A LAWSUIT AFTER THE FACT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT AW IS VERY LIMITED IN CHECKING UNFETTERED HEALTHCARE CONSOLIDATION. I'M THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK IT WOULD LIKE TO DO THE SECOND SPEAKER IN THE PANEL FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY WE ARE YOU ABLE TO STICK AROUND. YES OF COURSE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO OUR SECOND SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL OR SECOND WITNESS IS- MERRY WHAT NOT ME. SHE'S THE ACTIVE ACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE- SHOULD BE TESTIFYING BY PHONE ARE YOU OUT THERE. ADAM DIRECTOR. YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN YEAH PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD ALL GREAT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M VERY WATCH LOBBY THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE I AM JOINED BY A ON THE PHONE BY NANCY VARNER ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR UP EQUIPMENT BY THREE. OF THE DIMITRIEF MISSION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS HEALTH CARE RIGHT AND ENSURE A STABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM MORE THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING AND REGULATING A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE TO MORE THAN TWENTY SIX MILLION CONSUMERS WE REGULATE MORE THAN 96% OF THE COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT HEALTH PLAN ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE AND WE WERE INVITED HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR AUTHORITY TO REVIEW HEALTH PLAN CONSOLIDATION. MY REMARKS WILL DESCRIBE OUR ROLE REGARDING HEALTH PLAN MERGERS AND ACQUISITION OUR GOAL REGARDING NON PROFIT HEALTH PLAN RESTRUCTURING HOW WE MONITOR NEGOTIATED UNDERTAKING AND THE REVIEW OF SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT MERGERS THE DNA PEOPLE FORGET EVERYTHING. HERE THE LOCAL START WITH OUR OVER WITH RESPECT TO REVIEW OF HEALTH PLAN MERGERS ACT. ALL POLL WITHIN TEN DOUBLE AND WITH OR IN INTO A AGREEMENT. THAT WE BOTH IN THEIR PER OUR- OR CONTROL BY ENTITY INCLUDING ANOTHER WHOLE IN. MUST GIVE NOTICE TO THE DNA THE RECEIVE APPROVAL BEFORE COMPLY THE TRANSACTION. UNTIL EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THESE CONSOLIDATION WHAT THE PARENTS IN OUR LICENSING AUTHORITY AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT LICENSED HEALTH PLANS BETWEEN APPROVAL FOR MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE LIKE THAT. MERGERS AND OTHER CHANGES IN CONTROL CALL PART OF MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS AND TRIGGERED OUR REVIEW. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE NINE FIVE AUTHORED BY THE CHAIR CODIFIED AND CLARIFIED THE AUTHORITY AND ITS OWN ARTICLE THE KNOX KEEN ACT AND ADDED SEVERAL KEY COMPONENTS TO THE RADIO. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS WHEN REVIEWING MERGERS IS TO ENSURE HEALTH PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FINANCIAL. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT. OUR REVIEW OF MERGERS BETWEEN HEALTH PLAN FOCUSES ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES SUCH AS CHANGES AGREEMENT FROM APPEAL PROCESS THE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. WE ALSO REVIEW HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM CHANGES SUCH AS CHANGES TO A PROVIDER NETWORK. AND ANY CHANGES TO PRODUKTER SUBSCRIBER CONTRACTS THAT COULD IMPACT ENROLLEES pINCLUDING CHANGES TO SUBSCRIBER DOCUMENTS. SUCH AS EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE DOCUMENT. WE ALSO REVIEW. CHANGES INCLUDING IMPACT OF POTENTIAL ADEQUATE WORK KAPPA. OPERATIONS PAYMENT. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PRE AND POST POST TRANSACTION TO UNDERSTAND WHO WILL HOLD CONTROL. OF BOTH THE FINANCING OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE IMPACT OF THE PLANTS FINANCIAL STABILITY. AS I MENTIONED AB FIVE NINE FIVE ADDED COMPONENTS TO THIS REVIEW AND GAVE IT MORE SPECIFICITY IN THE LOCKHEED ACT. AND ALLOW THE GMAC TO DISAPPROVE A TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT IF IT FAILED TO SATISFY THE MARKET ACT OR IT WOULD BE ACTUALLY LESS THAN COMPETITION IN HEALTHCARE SERVICE PLAN PRODUCT OR CREATE A MONOPOLY IN THE STATE AB FIVE NINETY FIVE ALSO. THAT THE DNA MAKE INTO CONTENT IT THE TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT. INDIGENT CONTINGENT ON THE PLANT AGREEMENT UP UNTIL CONDITIONS ARE WHAT WE REFER TO AS AFTER TAKING. TO BENEFIT ENROLLEES ARE PROVIDE FOR A STABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. DO YOU MAKE THE MOST ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE TE MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT. A MAJOR TRADE. ARE GREEN THE DMH THE AS REQUIRE TO OBTAIN AND ENDED ABOUT. OF THE TRENDS IMPACT A WHOLE OPEN PUBLIC MEETINGS REGARDING THE TRANSACTION. MAJOR TRANSACTIONS ARE AGREEMENT ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ENROLLEES INVOLVED A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS. OR ADVERSELY AFFECT EITHER THE ENROLLEES OR THE STABILITY OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE MARKET THE SHOT. AB FIVE NINETY FIVE REQUIRES THE GEOMETRICAL CARE UP PUBLICLY AVAILABLE STATEMENT DESCRIBING ANY TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT THAT INVOLVES THE MATERIAL AMOUNT OF HEALTH PLAN ASSETS. AND FINALLY AB FIVE NINETY FIV REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO REIMBURSE THE DMH BEFORE THE COST OF REVIEWING THE MERGER. THE ACT OF AB FIVE NINETY FIVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET MAKES THE HAS NOT REVIEWED OR MERGER OR OTHER QUALIFYING TRANSACTION. THAT IT HAS DETERMINED TO BE A MAJOR TRANSACTION UNDER THE LAW. AND NOW MOVE ON TO DISCUSSING OUR ROLE WITH RESPECT TO NONPROFIT HEALTH PLAN RESTRUCTURING. IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE ISSUED THE DNA TESTING MUST CONSIDERED ITS REVIEW OF ANY HEALTH PLAN MERGER IF THE MERGER INVOLVED A NONPROFIT HEALTH PLAN THAT IS CONVERTED ARE RESTRUCTURING TO A FOR PROFIT HEALTH PLAN. THE DO YOU MAKE THE MOST REVIEW THE TRANSACTION UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE ELEVEN OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT. ARTICLE APPLIES WHEN TROOPS. ARE PRESENT. FIRST APPOINTMENT BE A NONPROFIT CORPORATION THAT HAS OUT THAT SUBJECT TO A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TRUST OBLIGATION. AND CHIU AT THE NONPROFIT PLAN HAVE SUCH OUT THAT THE PLAN MUST BE RESTRUCTURING OR SELLING THE POTENTIAL PORTION OF ITSELF IS TO OPPOSE. FOR PROFIT ENTITY. A LOT OF SCRIBES THE RULES. HEALTH PLAN MCFALL REACHED OF CONVERTING THEIR ACTIVITIES FROM BONN. NONPROFIT TO FOR PROFIT WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE NONPROFIT PLANS CHARITABLE ASSETS ARE PROTECTED UNDER UPON CONVERSION. THE DEMONS WE HAVE. REVIEWING IT FIRST TRANSACTION THAT QUALIFIES UNDER ARTICLE LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS ADDED TO THE KNOX KEEN ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. TRANSACTION INVOLVED STANFORD HEALTHCARE DAMAGE WHICH OPERATE THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN WITH APPROXIMATELY FORTY SIX HUNDRED IN RALEIGH AREA. IN THIS PROPOSED TO CONVERT FROM A NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION TO A FOR PROFIT CORPORATION. INDIA MAKES IT WILL HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE TRANSACTION ON DECEMBER EIGHTH THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW. AND FINALLY I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH NEGOTIATED UNDERTAKING- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE DAMAGE THEY CAN REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO COMMIT TO MAKING CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM PART OF OUR APPROVAL PROCESS FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THESE COMMITMENTS THAT WE CALL UNDERTAKINGS ARE ALSO USED TO ENSURE. MERGERS BENEFIT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. HISTORICALLY UNDERTAKING SEVEN COLLUDED REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAN TO INVEST IN SOLVING SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY ISSUES. SUCH AS DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE CENTRALIZED PROVIDER DIRECTOR DATA BASE TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF PROVIDER DATA. AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ENCOUNTER DATA. UNDERTAKING LEARN FOR SMOKING AGREED TO BY THE PLANE. SOME UNDERTAKEN TO REQUIRED PLANTS WITH THE NET POSTMARK INFORMATION AND THE DMH THE MONITORS STERN SURE THEY KEEP THE COMMITMENT THEY'VE MADE THE MERGER PROCESS. DMH THE STAFF EACH PLAN FOR CARE TO THE PLAY MEDIA IT'S CAN. THE DMH EMAIL WILL CONDUCT ON SITE AUDITS DETERMINE THE PLANET COMPLYING WITH THE UNDERTAKINGS. AND WE ALSO UP ON THESE UNDER DURING OUR BREAK SCHEDULED FINANCIAL EXAM AND MEDICAL. ALL CONCLUDE BY HIGHLIGHTING A COUPLE OF THE SIGNIFICANT MERGERS THAT WE'VE REVIEWED IN RECENT YEARS- THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED HEALTH NET HEALTH PLAN MERGERS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE DMH- THE THROWING STARTED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO- WHAT WE REFER TO AS MERGER MANIA ONE POINT NOW- AND IT STARTED WITH BLUE SHIELD ONE POINT TWO BILLION ACQUISITION OF CARE FIRST HEALTH PLAN. WHICH WE APPROVED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN- THE DODD TRANSACTION BROUGHT BLUESHIELD INTO THE MEDICAL MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE ALSO APPROVED CONTINUED ACQUISITION OF HEALTH NET AND A SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR MERGER. IN MARCH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THERE WERE TWO WOULD MORE BUT NATIONAL AND- AT THE THIRD SEVENTH. DOLLAR ACTED OF HUMANA ANTHEM FIFTY FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OF BIG BASS. BOTH OF THESE WERE BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. LOCATED FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE JUSTICE SICK PERSONALLY SUED TO STOP THE TRANSACTION. UNDER ANTITRUST LAWS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIOR TO AB FIVE NINETY FIVE TAKING EFFECT THE DMH THE REVERED SEGMENTS FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OF PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER EXPRESS SCRIPTS. AND CVS HEALTH'S SIXTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OF AT. AND UNITED AND UNITED HEALTH OPTUM UNIT FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OF DAVITA MEDICAL GROUP WHICH CLOSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS PART OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS IF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SECURE COMMITMENTS FROM PARTIES THAT BENEFIT- CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SEGMENT EXPRESS SCRIPTS TRANSACTION THEY AGREED TO A SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. INCLUDING TEN MILLION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BY FUNDING SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. UNDER THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION. THEY ALSO COMMITTED SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN PROGRAMS THE POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THE OPIATE CRISIS RIGHT THE- RUBIO. KNOW I AGREE TO INVEST NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PER SCHOLARSHIP JAMAL REPAYMENT PROGRAM UNDER THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FUND. AND THREE MILLION TO PROVIDE FREE DENTAL CARE TO PATIENTS EXPERIENCE BARRIERS TO CARE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING THE DMA THREE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU HAVE PLEASE HANG WITH US AND WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE ANY QUESTIONS. MICHAEL MISTER NAZARIAN THE QUESTION- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IN A SAUCE OR START SINCE YOU'RE ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW- MERRY I'LL GO AHEAD WITH WITH YOU- YOU KNOW. WHAT YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT- GMAC WAS LOOKING AT- THE PBM MERGERS AND- BUT WAS IS PART OF THAT PROCESS LOOKING AT WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT MIGHT BE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES- AND IF SO. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DID YOU FIND. OKAY ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE TYPICALLY PART OF OUR RUBIO THAT. TRANSACTION OCCURRED BEFORE OUR AB FIVE NINETY FIVE WITH THE PLACE- AND WILL REALLY LOOKING FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPONENTS OF THE BOX CARE ACT A AND- AGAIN THE IMPACT ON THE- ON BOTH PLANTS FINANCIAL ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF. OUR APARTMENT THE COST WAS NOT. PART OF OUR GREAT THE- SO WE REALLY SO THE CAN. WE DON'T KNOW- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD- FEELING FOR WHAT THAT CONSISTS THE CONSOLIDATION HAS DONE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. POST I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO IT BUT- POST MERGER WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES HAS BEEN CORRECT. ARE YOU- ARE YOU CONSIDER AS YOU CONSIDERED ANY UNDERTAKINGS OR CONDITIONS ON APPROVAL. DO YOU LOOK AT DID YOU LOOK AT. OR CONSIDER AFFORDABILITY OR IMPACTS TO ENROLLEES OUT OF POCKET COSTS LIKE CAR SHARING SIR PREMIUMS IS THAT PART OF. HIS UP PART OF YOUR PROCESS. YOUR NUMBERS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER WERE MADE WE LOOK AT UNDERTAKING- THIS IS PART OF. THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE GET OUR THAT OUR PUBLIC MEETING- AND A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT INCLUDE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES ARE OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED UNDERTAKING. IF SOMEBODY TRANSACTION WHERE WE HAVE HAD- HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE PRECEDED WITH- UNREASONABLE RATE INCREASES AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE THERE. WITHIN THE CVS AETNA TRANSACTION- AT THE STORE COOLEY HAD PROCEEDED WHERE- INCREASING. TO FIGHT OUR FINDING THAT THEY WERE AGGRIEVED- SO DO YOU I THINK IT FAMILIAR WITH RATE WE PROCESS YOU BREAK REVIEW ABOUT INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL MARKETS AND SELLS HAD A CAN DO IN THE UNDER. UNTIL THE PF AT THAT ACTUALLY COUPLE COUPLE- ARE ONE OF THE OTHER ONES THAT IT WITH THE NEXTRA. SCRIPT AS WELL- WHERE THEY GO NOT INCREASE PRE OF OVER OF ACT WITH- AND TO KEEPING TO ABOUT SO WE DO- YOU'RE TOGETHER TAKING PROFITS TO AND UNDER TO. MAKE SURE THAT. OF THE NUMBER IS CAPTAIN CONSUMER MAKE THOSE PREMIUM RIGHT TO A MINIMUM. GREAT THANK YOU- DO YOU HAVE ANY- OVERSIGHT OF THE- REGARD- YOU KNOW AFTER THE FACT IN. OF WHAT PLAN CAN. DONE AND OR RISING COSTS RELATE TO THOSE CA. YOU HAVE ANY ANY OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY THERE. I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE ZERO- YOU KNOW WE MONITOR THAT THE PLANS ARE- WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT THEY GREET YOU WITH THE UNDERTAKING FROM THE CONDITION- OF THE ACQUISITION- I'D MAYBE LET ME TURN TO NANCY ON THE- AND- YEAH YOU GOT THE PART THAT ANY OF OUR- FORTY. REPEAL PARTS. I'M EXCITED CAN'T EXCEPT- RELATED TO BE UNDERTAKING READ THE BOOK PLAN HAVE TO FILE A REPORT EACH YEAR EXPLAINING HOW THEY COMPLY WITH EACH UNDERTAKING INCLUDING. NOT RAISING PREMIUMS- UNNECESSARILY ARE RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION. OKAY ALL RIGHT GREAT WELL THANK YOU THINK THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU APPRECIATE THAT. I'M GONNA MOVE ON MY QUESTIONS- BACK TO- RADICA I MISS MISS GEORGE WITH THE AG'S OFFICE. HELLO HELLO WELCOME BACK- A COUPLE I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU CAN YOU- WE TALKED ABOUT THE END OF THE CHALLENGES IN PURSUING ANTI TRUST LITIGATION- AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE YOU YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE- GAPS IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW MAKE IT. ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO PURSUE OR ARE WE JUST SEEING A LACK OF INTEREST PARTICULARLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WELL I WOULD SAY AND I THINK THAT. THERE'S TWO PARTS TO IT THE FIRST PART YOU KNOW. AS I NOTED IN MY TESTIMONY THERE'S HE ISSUE OF WHY I'M ACTUALLY COMES TO THE NOTICE OF- FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS ON. AS AT PROFESSOR KING NOTED- THE IT IT'S ONLY THINGS THAT CON- WITHIN THE HEART HEART SCOTT REGINO THRESHOLD THAT WOULD COME TO THE NOTICE OF REGULATORS AND SO YOU ANYTHING BELOW THAT- IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT- WE AS THE STATE CURRENTLY RECEIVE NOTICE UP AND SO IT'S- MAKES IT PROBLEMATIC FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. ATTACK OVERSIGHT AND FOR THERE TO BE TRANSPARENCY- WITH RESPECT TO- ON WINDING TRANSACTIONS- THE DIFFICULTY IS MULTI IS THERE'S MULTIPLE ISSUES- YOU KNOW. ANY TIME YOU HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR ANY TIME YOU HAVE TO UNWIND A TRANSACTION ANYTIME YOU HAVE TO AND UNDERGO AN INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND AGO LITIGATION. IT INTRODUCES- I DIFFICULTY AND TIME TODAY TO ADD TO THE CHALLENGE INTO THE PROCESS BUT IT ALSO. INTRODUCES UNCERTAINTY RIGHT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT- TO- NOW TO CHALLENGE AND THEN HAVE THAT BE DEPENDENT UPON THE PARTICULAR PARTICULARITIES OF A JUDGE OR THEIR- ASSESSMENT OF THE CASE LAW. SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS I WOULD SAY BOTH THINGS I'M DEFINITELY I'M MORE NOTICE- OF THESE TRANSACTIONS BOTH A SMALLER TRANSACTIONS AND MERGERS AND ALSO A YOU KNOW A VERTICAL INTEGRATION SILVA PHYSICIANS' GROUPS- IN MILITARY CENTERS I FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL- SORRY CERTAINLY TO I HELP US- SO WE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MERGERS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY THAT YOU ACTUALLY. DO PASSED THE THRESHOLD PROCESS YOU TAKE INTO CONTENT INTO ACCOUNT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL SITUATION. YES CERTAINLY WHEN WE ARE IN OUR TRANSACTION REVIEW PROCESS WE- LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE DO TAKE INTO- INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT IS THE HOSPITAL I'M GOING TO EXIST WITHOUT ADD THE TRANSACTION OR THE AGREEMENT GOING INTO PLACE- WE AND IN PART OF THAT TOO AS WE ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I'M IN THE MEETINGS AND WRITTEN-PUBLIC COMMENT THAT GIVES US A FULL SOME PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE DO. AS I NOTED WE DO I'M ARE WE AND WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A HEALTH IMPACT REPORT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COMPETITION FACTOR SO ALL OF THAT. COMES INTO PLAY IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPROVE OR CONDITIONALLY APPROVED I TRANSACTION. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IN ANY IN THE SENSE OF- THE DICKON THE SMALLER CONSOLIDATIONS THAT ARE BELOW THE THRESHOLD. YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF THAT TO THE OVERALL CONSOLIDATION- COULD MARKET IS I MEAN. DO WE KNOW DO WE REALLY KNOW WHERE THESE THEY JUST THESE THINGS JUST FINE SO FAR UNDER THE RADAR THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO TRACK HIM. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AT THAT. DOCTOR WOULD I'M WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO TRAP THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING THE NOTICE ON WE HAVE TO RELY. ON WHAT WE SEE IN THE NEWS I THINK WE'VE THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET A SENSE OF A PICTURE OF. OF THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THE SMALLER TRANSACTIONS THE FOR PROFIT TRANSACTIONS- I'M UNLESS THEY ARE MAKING THE NEWS AND I'M MUCH WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT. I'M OTHERWISE BECAUSE WE DON'T GET THAT NOTICED. IS THERE- AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I I'M THINKING OF- SOME OF THE- ACQUISITIONS AND OPERATIONS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND HOW HOW- LAND MIGHT BE OWNED BY ONE GROUP. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A PRINCIPLE THAT'S CONNECTED TO ANOTHER- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IN THE CONSOLIDATION MARKET THE SMALLER CONSOLIDATION MARKET THAT THERE ARE. THAT THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMON TO THESE CONSOLIDATIONS. THAT ARE OPERATING IN SUCH A WAY TO KEEP THINGS BELOW THE THRESHOLD IS THAT A POSSIBILITIES SO AS TO NOT RAISE THE REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. YES I THINK THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE A POSSIBILITY IN AND THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU PROVIDED IS A GOOD ONE I'M I THINK YOU SEE THAT A LOT IN THE SKILLED NURSING. FACILITY SCENARIO- WHERE THEY'LL BE A PRINCIPLE THAT HOMES MAYBE LIKE TRANSACTION AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT AND TO TRACK AND THEY MAY NOT. EVEN COME TO THE LEVEL OF A PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DIG DEEP INTO IT. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE COULD THERE BE OTHER REASONS COSTS ARE GOING UP IN- BEAST BESIDES THE INTEGRATION I MEAN NO MEDIC INCREASING MEDICARE POPULATIONS OF THE RISING COSTS OF DRUGS I MEAN. THOSE THOSE POSSIBILITIES. THEY MAY BE BUT REALLY- VERTICAL HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION AND CROSSMARK I MARKET A FAX OR THE SINGLE BIGGEST DRIVER OF COST ON. IN CONSOLIDATION IN NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE- SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT AT WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE AFFECTING HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION RIGHT NOW- ANOTHER ANOTHER. BIG PART OF THAT TOO IS THE ANOTHER DRIVER OF COST IS THE ACQUISITION OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BY PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS AND HEDGE FUNDS- JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A NATURAL TENSION BETWEEN- THERE NEED TO RETURN INVESTMENT IN A CERTAIN A LIMITED TIME FRAME- I'M IN A STORE WINDOW AND- THE PROVISION OF QUALITY HEALTHCARE AT A LOW COST. SO THESE ARE THE BIG DRIVERS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS GROUPINGS AND SO- I HER RT HER PART OF THE ANSWER BURKE AND I AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE HERE- YOU KNOW FROM THE AG'S OFFICE PERSPECTIVE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT. OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION. YES THANK YOU EAT. WE BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY THE GOLD STANDARD WOULD BE TO HAVE SORT OF SOME SORT OF A OUR- SYSTEM OF REVIEW OF PRE TRANSACTION REVEAL I'M GIVING US THE ABILITY. TO LOOK AT THESE TRANSACTIONS- I'M IN A STRUCTURED WAY BEFORE I DAY A CAR ON IT BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO THAT THAN TO I'M I'M SCRAMBLE THE ACHES ASKING- AND THEN AT THE VERY LEAST THERE SHOULD BE NOTICED. OF THESE TRANSACTIONS- BOTH. YOU KNOW THE MEDIUM SIZE A SMALL ONES AND- HOW THE SYSTEMS OUTSIDE PHYSICIANS GROUPS OUT YOU KNOW. OUTPATIENT CLINICS THINGS LIKE THAT TIME SO NOTIFICATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY. INVESTIGATION AND JUST I THINK PROVIDE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THESE CONSOLIDATION SO WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW AND TRACK. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACES OUT OF IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. I WOULD SAY THE VERY LEAST WE NEED THAT OBVIOUSLY PRE- PRE TRANSACTION REVIEW I'M TO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO THESE. WOULD BE THE GOLD STANDARD. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TEST TODAY WE APPRECIATE IT AND- WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR OUR OUR FINAL SPEAKER THEN THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THAT WOULD BE WERE BRINGING AND BRINGING IT BACK TO- PROFESSOR KING. GOOD TO TALK TO US ABOUT THE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION PROFESSOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH GIVE ME THANK YOU SO MUCH- I AM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE SO NEXT SLIDE AND I'LL PICK UP UP RIGHT HERE SO. I THINK THERE ARE FOUR THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE FOR AREAS THAT THAT CALIFORNIA CAN TARGET FIRST. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET THE DATA WHAT WE CONSISTENTLY HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING AND OTHER HEARINGS IS THAT IT IS A LACK. OF DATA ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS CAUSING US TO NOT HAVE ALWAYS THE BEST INSIGHTS INTO THE BEST WAYS TO REGULATE TO LEGISLATE AND TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE- SO GETTING THE DATA BOTH HEALTH CARE PRICING DATA BUT ALSO INFORMATION ON. WHEN TRANSACTIONS CONSOLIDATING TRANSACTIONS ARE HAPPENING WHAT TYPES OF TRANSACTION. WHO IS CONSOLIDATING MARKET ALL OF THAT IS AND- FOR YOU HAVE THAT DATE YOU ALSO NEED AND- AT TO ANIL IT AND- IN. TO POLICY SO FIRST THING WE CAN DO IS GET THE DAY AND BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THAT. THANK WE NEED TO ANTI ENHANCE ANY TRY IN FOR. AS MR TO POINTED OUT NEED TO HAVE NOTICED FOR- AND ALSO I BELIEVE A REVIEWER. AND APPROVAL. THIRD WE NEED A PASSWORD. TO SUPPORT COMPETITION AND ADDRESS MARKET DEFICIENCIES AND THEN FOURTH WE NEED TO ENHANCE AGENCY OVERSIGHT OVER HEALTH CARE MARKETS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LET'S START WITH THE DATA SO CALIFORNIA'S IN THAT- IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING ITS HEALTH CARE COST TRANSPARENCY DATABASE- WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IT'S AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE AT. AND THAT WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON PAR WITH THE EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE EXISTING ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA BASES. THESE DATABASES WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES IN THEIR HEALTHCARE AND BE ABLE TO SEE THE VARIANCE IN PRICE BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND SELECT ONE THAT WAS MAYBE HIGHER VALUE. THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND THE MOST EFFECTUAL THING THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE DATA. THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THIS DATA IS FOR POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE SEEN THE STATE'S THAT HAVE EFFECTIVELY ANALYZED AND USED THIS DATA. USE IT IN WAYS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THEIR HEALTHCARE MARKETS. INFORM MERGER AND ALICE'S AND REVIEW AS THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IN MASSACHUSETTS DID SO SUCCESSFULLY- IN THE PARTNERS CASE I THINK IT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF COST AND TRACK PRICES POST CONSOLIDATION TO SEE WHAT THE OUTCOME. OF A MERGER ACTUALLY WAS- IT CAN BE USED TO TRACK UTILIZATION AND PRICE TRENDS OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SAW IN THE DATA WHERE OUR PRICES WERE VERY HIGH BETTER UTILIZATION UTILIZATION WAS VERY LOW IF YOU HAD THAT DATA YOU COULD DIG INTO IT MORE TO FIND OUT. WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF PRICE. YOU CAN USE THIS DATA TO IDENTIFY LOW VALUE SERVICES INFORM AND PRIORITIZE POLICY GOALS AND MONITOR POLICY INITIATIVES. IT CAN ALSO BE USED- TO ESTABLISH BENCHMARK PRICING AND HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARKS AS WE'VE SEEN IN MASSACHUSETTS SO THIS DATA CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN LOTS OF WAYS. FURTHERMORE NEXT SLIDE AT THE STATE OF FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF ANY INITIATIVE THAT THE STATE MIGHT WANT TO. PROMOTE TO SUPPORT COMPETITIVE MARKETS SO WHETHER THE STATE IS LOOKING TOWARDS LITIGATION LEGISLATION OR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WHICH THEY NEED ALL THREE TO SUPPORT COMPETITIVE MARKETS. THAT DATA IS REALLY GOING TO FORM THE FOUNDATION OF ANY INITIATIVE THAT THEY PUT FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF LITIGATION BUT IT'S- LESS RELEVANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE SO I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON IT- BUT- THE STATE CAN INTERVENE THROUGH LITIGATION IN REALLY THREE WAYS AND THE STORAGE REALLY POINT AT ALL ALL OF THESE OUT. SO I WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON IT- NEXT SLIDE. BUT FIRST IS A PRE MERGER CHALLENGE WHERE THE STATE CAN INTERVENE. BEFORE THE MERGER HAPPENS TO PREVENTIVE CONSOLIDATION FROM OCCURRING AT ALL THIS IS REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD WHEN WE THINK OF ANTI TRUST ENFORCEMENT YOU WANT TO PREVENT CONSOLIDATION BEFORE IT HAPPENS- THEN WE'VE SEEN SUCCESSFUL PRE MERGER CHALLENGES. OCCUR IN THE SAINT LUKE'S CASE IN IDAHO. AND THE PARTNER SOUTH SHORE CASE IN MASSACHUSETTS AS WELL AS THE SANFORD HEALTH CASE. AND IN NORTHERN IN NORTH DAKOTA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO NEXT IS. THE CONDITIONAL APPROVAL AND OVERSIGHT AND WE BOTH HEARD- MADAM DIRECTOR ONCE NOW THEY AND THE STORAGE TALK ABOUT CONDITIONS PLACED ON MERGERS TO GO THROUGH THE REALITY IS THAT THE AG'S OFFICE AND DAMAGE THE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT EVERY CONSOLIDATING TRANSACTION IN THE HEALTH PLAN SPACE OR- IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SPACE FROM COMING TO FRUITION AND SO THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO. AB IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THOSE MERGERS AND THOSE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL I WE'VE SEEN THESE BE IS VERY EFFECTIVELY IN THE BETH ISRAEL LAHEY CASE AND MASSACHUSETTS- AND IN OTHER STATES AS WELL AS THE C. H. I. DIGNITY CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO NEXT SLIDE. SO EARLIER THIS YEAR- I WROTE A PAPER WITH BOB BERENSON CATHERINE GOT X. N. AND ROSALYN MURRAY AND IS A PART OF THAT PAPER WE LOOKED AT CONSENT DECREES AND THE KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED AND PUT THEM INTO A TYPOLOGY. AND WHAT WE DID WAS THESE- WE CAME UP WITH FIVE THINGS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED BY STATES AS CONDITIONS. AND THESE CAN BE PUT IN PLACE- AS A PART OF ALLOWING THE MERGER TO GO FORWARD SO THE FIRST IS. INSURED NEGOTIATION REQUIREMENTS REQUIRING THAT ENTITIES THE MERGING ENTITIES ENGAGED IN ARBITRATION. SECOND WE SAW THINGS LIKE LIMITATIONS ON CONTRACT TERMS HERE FOR A STATE AT THE STATE COULD IMPOSE LIMITS ON PRICE INCREASES. ON MARGINS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR ON PRICES OVERALL THEY CAN JUST SIMPLY CAP PRICES. THIRD WE THOUGHT PROHIBITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN CONTRACT PROVISIONS. ON THINGS LIKE BANNING THE USE OF MOST FAVORED NATION CLAUSES GAG CLAUSES AND ANTI STEERING PROVISIONS THAT CAN BE DONE AS PART OF A CONSENT DECREE- I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE MORE IN IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT. LEGISLATION AS WELL IN A MINUTE. FOURTH THEY CAN BE USED TO PROHIBIT OR REQUIRE CERTAIN TYPES OF CONDUCT THINGS LIKE REQUIRING RELEASE OF PHYSICIANS FROM NON COMPETE CLAUSES AS A PART OF THE MERGER. AND THEN FIFTH THEY CAN BE USED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CERTAIN POPULATIONS- AND ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO CARE FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES AND FOR LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND FINALLY LITIGATION CAN BE USED- TO CHALLENGE ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR STATES TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER. CONSOLIDATION OF THE MARKET AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED ALREADY AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MONITORING AND CAN EFFECTIVELY. MANAGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE ENTITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF MARKET POWER AND WE SAW THE AG'S OFFICE DO THIS VERY SUCCESSFULLY IN THE SUTTER HEALTH CASE- THAT WAS THAT WAS TRIED LAST YEAR. AND THEN ALSO THE NORTH CAROLINA AG DID THAT VERY SUCCESSFULLY IN THE ATRIUM CASE BOTH OF THOSE CASES CAME DOWN AND SETTLEMENTS BUT THEY WERE QUITE. A STRONG SETTLEMENTS FROM THE POSITION OF THE AG SO. NEXT SLIDE- SO THESE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENTS AS CAN LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO. THE FIRST IS THAT THEY CAN PROHIBIT ALL OR NOTHING CONTRACTING. AND THEN REQUIRE ISOLATED CONTRACTING TO REQUIRE HEALTH SYSTEMS. TO BREAK UP HOW INSURERS CONTRACT WITH THEM SO THEY CAN'T DO THAT LEVERAGING THAT- CHAIRMAN WOULD AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. WHERE THEY LEVERAGE A MUST HAVE PROVIDER TO DRIVE UP PRICES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM- THE NEXT TERM OF THE SETTLEMENT. IS AB PROHIBIT ANY COMPETITIVE CONTRACT TERMS- THINGS LIKE ANY TEARING ANY STEERING CLAUSES WHICH WE SAW THE STTLEMENT. IN THE SUTTER HEALTH CASE IN THE ATRIUM HEALTH CASE PROHIBIT. THIRD THEY CAN REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS OR AN ABANDONMENT OF THE MERGER ALTOGETHER AS WE SAW IN SAINT LUKE'S AND CHI FRANCISCAN. AND THEN FINALLY THEY CAN PROVIDE MONETARY RELIEF- AND THEY SAID THE CENTER SETTLEMENT HERE- CAME IN AT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH I KNOW HAS BEEN FINALIZED YET BUT THAT'S THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT NUMBER- SO THESE SETTLEMENTS CAN DO. A LOT FOR DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND INFORMING. THE MARKETS M. AND MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON WHAT BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE NEXT SLIDE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT LITIGATION ONLY GOES SO FAR IT IS VERY ARDUOUS AS IN A STORAGE POINTED OUT AND IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO. TO WIN THE CASE IS THAT YOU BRING AND SO LITIGATION IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE TENDING TO ONE PLANT IN YOUR GARDEN- THAT'S MAYBE. NOT DOING SO WELL- BUT YOU NEED RULES OF THE ROAD AND AN OVER ARCHING PLAN TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE MARKET- THE ENTIRE FARM. SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH LEGISLATION- TO. ADDRESS MARKET CONSOLIDATION AND AN CONTROL PRICES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO OVER THE LAST- SEVERAL YEARS I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT STATE LEGISLATION TO DO JUST THAT TO CONTROL MARKET CONSOLIDATION AND PRICES AND STATES HAVE REALLY BUNDLED AS THEY THEY SORT OF ATTACKED THIS PROBLEM IN THREE WAYS SO THE FIRST IS BY NEXT LINE THE FIRST IS BY ADDRESSING SPECIFIC MARKET IMPERFECTIONS. THINGS LIKE MOST FAVORED NATION PROHIBITIONS SURPRISE BILLING LAWS ANTI STEERING AB PROHIBITIONS AND ALL OR NOTHING SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE CONTRACT TERMS. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE NEXT SLIDE IS THAT NINETEEN STATES. I HAVE PROHIBITED THE USE OF MOST FAVORED NATIONS PROVISIONS MOST FAVORED NATIONS PROVISIONS REQUIRE- A PROVIDER TO GUARANTEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL NOT GIVE A BETTER PRICE OR A BETTER RATE. TO ANY OF THE INSURERS COMPETITORS TO ANY OTHER INSURER AND IF THEY DO THEY HAVE TO THEN PROVIDE THE ENSURE THEY GAVE THE MOST FAVORED NATION PROVISION TO A LOWER PRICE AS WELL. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS IT ALLOWS PRICES TO DRIFT UP ESPECIALLY IN MARKETS WHERE THERE IS A DOMINANT INSURER ORGANIZATION AND A DOMINANT PROVIDER ORGANIZATION. OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THAT CASE IS THE DOMINANT INSURER CAN AGREE TO A VERY HIGH RATE ASKED FOR BY THE DOMINANT PROVIDER ORGANIZATION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOST MUST HAVE. I MUST HAVE PROVIDERS IN THEIR SYSTEM. THEY CAN ASK FOR A VERY HIGH RATE AND THE INSURER CAN GRANTED AS LONG AS THE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION GIVES THEM A MOST FAVORED NATION CLAUSE. AND THIS OCCURS SO THEY SAY WILL PAY THE HIGHEST RATE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GIVE ANY OF OUR COMPETITORS A BETTER RATE. AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THIS ALLOWS THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE TO RISE UP AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY CAN PASS THOSE COSTS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER PREMIUMS. ALONG TO EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS. SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE NINETEEN STATES HAVE PRO HAD PROHIBITED THIS AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK. REQUIRES ANY CONTRACT WITH LANGUAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE A MOST FAVORED NATION CLAUSE I TO BE REVIEWED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RESTRICTION OF ANTI TEARING AN ANTI STEERING PROVISIONS THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT ARE OFTEN ASKED FOR BY DOMINANT PROVIDERS- THAT. PREVENTED THE INSURER FROM SIGNALING THAT THESE PROVIDERS ARE CHARGED HIGHER PRICES OR MIGHT BE OF LOWER VALUE THAN OTHER PROVIDERS ALSO IN THE NETWORK AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REALLY SHIELDS. BOTH THE INSURERS ABILITY TO STEER PATIENTS TO HIGHER VALUE PROVIDERS BUT IT ALSO PREVENTS THE IN. THE AB PATIENT FROM REALLY KNOWING. THAT THE PROVIDERS THEY MIGHT BE PICKING- ARE HIGHER PRICED. OVERALL AND SO THEY CONTINUE TO GO TO THOSE PROVIDERS WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE THEY PAY THE SAME COPAY- AS THEY WOULD TO GO TO A HIGHER VALUE PROVIDER. AND SO WHAT WE CAN SEE HERE IS THAT CALIFORNIA AND NORTH CAROLINA HAD THOSE TWO CASES THAT CHALLENGED THE USE OF THESE. A LAWS AND PROHIBITED THEM AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. FOR THOSE THOSE PROVISIONS MASSACHUSETTS HAS BANNED THE USE OF ANY TEARING IN ANY STEERING CAUSES IN PROVIDER ENSURE CONTRACTS AND BOTH NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY HAVE BILLS CONSIDERING THAT THIS TERM NEITHER OF THEM PASSED I THINK LARGELY DUE TO CODE BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME BACK. NEXT YEAR. SO NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE RESTRICTION OF ALL OR NOTHING PRO PROVISIONS. IN CONTRACTS ALL OR NOTHING I DESCRIBED EARLIER WHERE YOU HAVE A MUST HAVE. OF PROVIDER POTENTIALLY IN ONE IN ONE AREA AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY NEEDS TO HAVE THAT PROVIDER IN THE SYSTEM. AND THE- HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE NETWORK AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS REQUIRING THAT THAT INSURER IN ORDER TO GET THE MUST HAVE ENTITIES. HAS TO CONTRACT WITH ALL OF THE PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM. AND PAY THE RATES DEMANDED BY THE DOMINANT PROVIDER AND SO. THIS PRACTICE WAS CHALLENGED IN THE SUTTER CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT WAS PROHIBITED AS PART OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. MASSACHUSETTS HAS LAWS RESTRICTING THE USE OF THIS PRACTICE AND NEW YORK IN COLORADO ALSO HAD BILLS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE USE OF ALL OR NOTHING CLAUSES. AND IN THEIR- IN THEIR LEGISLATURES THIS YEAR TO THOSE DID NOT PASS- AS WELL THERE ARE SOME. POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL EFFICIENCIES THAT WOULD COME OUT OF ALL OR NOTHING CONTRACTING AND SO I THINK THIS IS IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE A GOOD OVERSIGHT. OVER THE USE OF THIS PRACTICE TO DETERMINE HOW IT'S BEING USED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THOSE ARE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF LAWS THAT THE STATE COULD PASS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC MARKET IMPERFECTIONS. BUT OTHER STATES AND EVEN SOME OF THE SAME STATES ARE LOOKING TO ADDRESS MARKET FUNCTION OVERALL AND SO THEY'VE DONE THIS. THROUGH ENHANCING THEIR PRICE TRANSPARENCY LAWS EXPANDING THEIR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASES ARE STARTING AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. AND THEY'VE ALSO DONE THAT BY ENHANCING THEIR MERGER REVIEW PRACTICES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO OVER THE LAST ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF MY COLLEAGUES AT UC HASTINGS AND AT THE SOURCE ON HEALTHCARE PRICING COMPETITION AS WELL AS THE PETROUS CENTER AT UC BERKELEY. HAVE BEEN EXAMINING THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN ALL FIFTY STATES- PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WITH RESPECT TO MERGER REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT. AND WE'VE CATEGORIZED THOSE LAWS INTO FIVE DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL AS THE PRACTICES FOLLOWING A MERGER BOTH IN TERMS OF OVERSTATING CONSENT AGREES WE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL. WE PUT THEM INTO FIVE CATEGORIES NOTICE REVIEW CRITERIA APPROVAL CONSENT DECREES AND CONDITIONAL APPROVAL AND POST TRANSACTION OVERSIGHT. AND THEN WE TOOK THE STATE'S AND WE PUT WE GROUP THEM INTO SIX CATEGORIES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SORT OF THEIR OVER ARCHING LEVEL OF MERGER REVIEW. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE NEXT SLIDE. IS THAT THERE'S QUITE A RANGE AROUND THE UNITED STATES. WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF MERGER REVIEW IF ALREADY CAPTURED BY ANY STATE- SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S EVERYTHING FROM THEY HAVE. NO NOTICE REQUIREMENT NO APPROVAL NOTHING FOR- HOSPITALS IN ANY KIND OF WAY ALL THE WAY UP TO STATES IN THE DARKEST BLUE OF WHICH CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ONE- AT THAT SIX LEVEL. APPROVAL OF EITHER NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS OR ALL HOSPITALS BASED ON REVIEW CRITERIA RELATED TO PRICING COMPETITION WE FELT LIKE THAT WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY ESTATE COULD HAVE. AND THEY'RE FOURTEEN STATES WITHOUT LEVEL OF AUTHORITY INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. SO AFTER DOING ALL THIS RESEARCH WE LOOKED AND FOUND ON THE NEXT SIDE YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE FIVE STATES WITH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE TRANSACTION REVIEW POLICIES AND PRACTICES WE FOUND THEM TO BE CALIFORNIA CONNECTICUT MASSACHUSETTS PENNSYLVANIA AND RHODE ISLAND. NO IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE IS THAT NONE OF THESE STATES FULLY ENCAPSULATE THE GOLD STANDARD ALL OF THEM HAVE VERY INTERESTING AND UNIQUEFEATURES AND VERY STRONG MERGER REVIEW AUTHORITY BUT NONE OF THEM SORT OF HAVE THE FULL PACKAGE- AND SO THAT'S WHERE THEY ALL HAVE SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SO TO SPEAK. NEXT SLIDE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. CALIFORNIA HAS MERGER REVIEW A MERGER PRE MERGER NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND PRE MERGER APPROVAL- BY THE AG AS WELL AS REVIEW CRITERIA RELATED TO COMPETITION AND PRICE BUT IT ONLY HAS THAT FIRM NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS AND AS MR AND POINTED OUT. THERE A LOT OF OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE CONSOLIDATING INCLUDING FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS FOR PROFIT ENTITIES LIKE. PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS BUYING UP- FREESTANDING EMERGENCY CLINICS AND OTHER YOU KNOW OTHER AND SHE'S IN THE MARKET SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN HEALTH CARE THAT IS NOT JUST IN THE REALM OF NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- ARE TWO OTHERS SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL SORT OF COVERED THE SLIDE. SO CALIFORNIA THE AG'S OFFICE- WE HEAR WE DON'T HAVE A REVIEW OF COMPETITION BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE STATUTE BUT THEY DO HAVE IT IN THE REGULATION THOUSAND STORAGE POINTED OUT. SO ON NEXT SLIDE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS A COMPARISON OF THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THESE FIVE STATES. SO MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT HAD THE HIGHEST NOTED STANDARDS AND THEY REQUIRE NOTICE BY- ALL VAIDER ENTITIES THAT ARE ENGAGING AND EMERGING TRANSACTION SO THAT WOULD BE ALL HOSPITALS BOTH FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT ALL PROVIDER GROUP PRACTICES ANY PROVIDER ORGANIZATION- AND THAT NOTICE HAS TO GO NOT ONLY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- BUT ALSO TO EITHER THE HEALTH POICY COMMISSION IN MASSACHUSETTS. OR TO- THE CEO AND THE CERTIFICATE OF NEED DEPARTMENT IN CONNECTICUT AND SO THERE'S ALSO DUAL AGENCIES RECEIVING THIS NOTICE AND BEING ABLE TO EXAMINE IT FROM THEIR PARTICULAR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRING NOTICE. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS AGAIN A MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT ARE SORT OF TOPPING THE LIST WITH REQUIRING NOTIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL CHANGED TO OPERATIONS OR GOVERNANCE OF A- OF A PROVIDER OR PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT VERY BROAD SET OF NOTICE NOT ONLY. BROAD IN WHAT ENTITIES CAN TRIGGER NOTICE BUT ALSO THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT CAN TRIGGER NOTICE IT'S NOT JUST MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IT'S ALL TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT CAN BE CONSOLIDATING. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE AGAIN IS THAT CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW HAS THIS TYPE OF NOTICE REQUIREMENT BUT IT'S ONLY FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN TERMS OF APPROVAL OF RHODE ISLAND AND CONNECTICUT HAVE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS HERE RHODE ISLAND REQUIRES PRE TRANSACTION APPROVAL FOR ALL HOSPITALS A CONNECTICUT REQUIRES PRE TRANSACTION APPROVAL BY ITS HEALTH SYSTEMPLANNING UNIT WHICH IS THEIR CERTIFICATE OF NEED AGENCY- AND THAT'S FOR ALL HOSPITALS. TRANSACTION AND ALL PHYSICIAN GROUPS- AND AGAIN CALIFORNIA REALLY LOOKS AT THAT WITH RESPECT TO. IT'S NONPROFIT ACQUIRE HE'S ONLY I ALSO WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MASSACHUSETTS COLUMN BECAUSE WHAT YOU'LL SEE HERE IS THAT MASSACHUSETTS DOESN'T HAVE AN APPROVAL REQUIREMENT IN THE SAME WAY THAT RHODE ISLAND CONNECTICUT DO. BUT THEY REQUIRE THAT THAT NOTICE GO TO THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION AND THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IF THE IF THE MERGER IS. LARGE ENOUGH AND HAS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT'S GREAT ENOUGH IT WILL TRIGGER AT A COST AND MARKET IMPACT REVIEW BY THE H. P. C. AND THEN THAT WILL. THAT CAN IT SERVE TO INFORM WHETHER OR NOT THE AG'S OFFICE DECIDES TO MAKE- TO BRING A CHALLENGE TO THAT PARTICULAR MURDER SO THERE WILL BE. SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATION AND DATA THAT WILL BE PRODUCED ABOUT THAT MERGER THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO BRING A CASE OKAY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO AFTER LOOKING AT ALL FIFTY STATES PLUS DC AND THEN LOOKING IN DEPTH AT THESE FIVE STATES WE CAME UP WITH WHAT WE FELT LIKE WAS THE GOLD STANDARD. UP FOR PRE MERGER. R. FOR JUST MERGER AUTHORITY AND MERGER OVERSIGHT. AND AGAIN WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT. WE THOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BROAD SET OF NOTICE BOTH BROAD IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF ENTITIES THAT WOULD TRIGGER NOTICE BUT ALSO IN THE SCOPE OF TRANSITIONS. TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD TRIGGER THAT SO NOT JUST MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS BUT AGAIN ANY MATERIAL CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL. WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT MULTIPLE STATE ENTITIES SHOULD RECEIVE THIS NOTICE SO THAT I COULD SHARE THE BURDEN IN TERMS OF USING THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED BY OTHER AGENCIES TO HELP INFORM THE MERGER DECISION- WE DID THINK THAT APPROVAL SHOULD BE HOUSED IN ONE AGENCY ALONE BUT JUST INFORMED BY OTHER AGENCIES. AND WE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A SUFFICIENT WAITING PERIOD FOR THE STATE TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND GATHER MORE INFORMATION. SO THAT IT WASN'T A VERY RUSHED PROCESS. IN TERMS OF REVIEW WE FELT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW CRITERIA- THAT WAS CODIFIED. SO THAT IT THE ENTITY TO CONDUCTING THE REVIEW WOULD REVIEW THE TRANSACTION TERMS OF ITS IMPACT ON COMPETITION AND THE MARKETS. AFFORDABILITY AND PRICES ACCESS TO CARE QUALITY OF CARE- AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL AS IF IT'S A NONPROFIT HOSPITAL OF WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD. HAD MET ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY IN TERMS OF. REVIEWING REVIEWING THE CRITERIA AND THE TRANSACTION. NOW WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A BIG UNDERTAKING AND IT WOULD BE A LOT FOR THE AG'S OFFICE TO HAVE TO DO ALL OF THIS- OR FOR ANOTHER STATE AGENCY TO HAVE TO DO ALL OF THIS AND WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE A TIERED LEVEL OF REVIEWS SO DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF ANY TRUST RISK OR THE SIZE OF THE TRANSACTION. IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. TO HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF REVIEW. AND INTRODUCE TACIT APPROVAL IF THE AG'S OFFICE DOES NOT. REJECT OR CHALLENGER MARC- YOU KNOW APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS INTRODUCED CONDITIONS. ON YOUR MERGER WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THAN THE MERGER IS PRESUMED TO PROVE THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF SCALE IT ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF ANTITRUST RISK. WE ALSO FELT THAT INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS SHOULD BE PAID FOR- COULD BE USED IN THIS AND PAID FOR BY THE MERGING ENTITIES TO HELP DEFRAY SOME OF THE COSTS FOR THE STATE- WE ALSO FELT THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. TO HAVE SUBPOENA FOR THE STATE ENTITIES TO HAVE SUBPOENA POWER TO GET ACCESS TO WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY NEEDED TO HELP MAKE THEIR DECISION. WE FELT THAT THE GOLD STANDARD WOULD ALSO BE. TO HAVE PRE TRANSACTION APPROVAL AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. OR ANOTHER STATE AGENCY- AND AGAIN THIS APPROVAL AUTHORITY COULD BE TACIT FOR LOWER RISK- BUT MUCH MORE ACTUAL FOR- FOR HIGHER RISK TRANSACTIONS. AND FINALLY WE FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE IS A STRONG AMOUNT OF POST TRANSACTION MONITORING NOT JUST FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ALL A PART OF THE MERGER BUT ALSO RETROSPECTIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT. A INDIVIDUALS HAD- THAT. THE MURDERS THAT HAD GONE THROUGH WERE NOT RAISING PRICES AND THOSE ENTITIES WERE NOT EXERCISING THEIR ABUSING THEIR MARKET POWER. NEXT SLIDE. FINALLY THIS BRINGS ME TO MARKET OVERSIGHT AND AGAIN IT I WANT TO RAISE THE POINT THAT EVERYTHING I JUST TALKED ABOUT WAS SORT OF TO PREVENT FURTHER CONSOLIDATION BUT WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT OUR MARKETS ARE ALREADY HEAVILY CONSOLIDATED AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT CONSOLIDATION AND PREVENTED- FROM CONTINUING TO RAISE COSTS AND- CHALLENGE OUR- OUR ECONOMY. SO AND MAKING IT HARD FOR CITIZENS TO GET HEALTH CARE SO IN TERMS OF THAT THERE CAN BE BETTER MARKET OVERSIGHT SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS. THERE'S REGULATORY THERE'S OPTIONS FOR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND RESTRICTIONS THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES INCLUDE MONITORING MARKET TRENDS ACT MARKET CONSOLIDATION TRENDS IN ALL HEALTHCARE SECTORS- REQUIRING COST AND MARKET IMPACT REPORTS. OFFERING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND- EITHER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OR IN OUR CASE DAMAGE SEE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW AND FOR AN PROVIDER RATE AND A COMPREHENSIVE RATE REVIEW WAY. ALSO GIVING THE- DMH C. OR THE DAMAGE HE MAY MISS CASE MOST LIKELY- THE ABILITY TO REVIEW ENSURE PROVIDER CONTRACTS FOR ANY COMPETITIVE CONTRACT TERMS. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS SO OFFERING A STATE AGENCY THE- BOTH THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE STATE AND NOT GIVE THEM WE'VE SEEN IN RHODE ISLAND THAT GAVE THE OFFICE OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER A LOT OF AUTHORITY. TO TRY AND REIN IN PRICES. WE'VE ALSO SEEN EFFECTIVE RESTRICTIONS BE USED THROUGH THIS TYPE OF OVERSIGHT SO. AND I APOLOGIZE THERE'S A COUPLE OF WORDS THAT I WOULD CHANGE ON THE SLIDE- SO IN TERMS OF RHODE ISLAND IN COLORADO IN TERMS OF RESTRICTIONS THEY HAD PROVIDER AND INSURER RATE REVIEW IF COST GROWTH AND- IF COST GROWTH EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD. THE COST GROWTH BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN TERMS OF PREMIUMS OR IN TERMS OF THE RATES BEING PAID THEN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN RHODE ISLAND CAN COME IN. AND REJECTED THE RATE INCREASE BOTH AT THE INSURANCE PREMIUM LEVEL BUT THEY CAN ALSO REJECT THE CONTRACT BASED ON THE RATES PAID TO THE PROVIDERS SO THAT'S A GOOD LARGE- IT'S A LARGE INCREASE IN AUTHORITY. FOR THOSE ENTITIES AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTROL COSTS WE'VE ALSO SEEN HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARKS. IN MASSACHUSETTS AND DELAWARE. AND I THINK THAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AT TRYING TO CONSTRAIN OVER ALL THE TOTAL HELD ECONOMIC. THE HEALTH X. COST EXPENDITURES AND THAT CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL WE'VE ALSO SEEN RATE CAPS. IN THE STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFIT PROGRAMS IN MONTANA AND OREGON. THOSE HAVE. JUST SET A PRICE THAT. AND GETTING HEALTH CARE- AND THAT HAS BEEN ALSO TRIED IN A NUMBER OF PUBLIC OUT STATE PUBLIC OPTION BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING FORWARD AND SO JUST ESTABLISHING RATE CAPS ON AS A FUNDAMENTAL A PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE PRICES NEXT SLIDE SO I JUST WANT TO AND WITH SOME PARTICULAR OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK WOULD BE EFFECTIVE- ENHANCING CONSOLIDATION REVIEW OVERALL. REQUIRING NOTICED AN APPROVAL FOR ANY MATERIAL CHANGE INVOLVING A HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN GROUP OR PROVIDER ORGANIZATION. REVIEWING ALL HEALTH CARE TRANSACTIONS FOR IMPACT TO PRICE COMPETITION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND THEN THE CREATING OR DESIGNATING OF AN AGENCY TO REVIEW OUR MONITOR CONSOLIDATION ACTIVITY AND MARKET FUNCTION. WITH RESPECT TO ANY COMPETITIVE CONTRACTING PRACTICES- THE STATE COULD CONSIDER PROHIBITING MOST ANY TEARING AN ANTI STEERING PROVISIONS AS WELL AS MOST FAVORED NATION PERFECT. PROVISIONS AND IT COULD ALSO CREATE OR DESIGNATED AGENCY TO REVIEW HEALTH INSURER PROVIDER CONTRACTS FOR ANY COMPETITIVE LANGUAGE. AND FINALLY THE STATE COULD ENHANCE ITS REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SO BY OFFERING PROVIDER AND INSURER RATE REVIEW WITH RATE APPROVAL FOR GROWTH OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD AND CONSIDER- IMPLEMENTING AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS AND WITH THAT I'LL STOP. OF AND TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU CAN ADVANCE ASIDE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RETURNED TO MY COLLEAGUES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. MY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED SOME OF THEM I HAD TROUBLE FINDING MY FLIGHT SO I MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOME OF IT SO EXCUSE ME IF YOU ANSWER SOME OF THESE- SOME OF THE FIVE STATES WITH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. POLICIES I UNDERSTAND THAT NONE OF THEM ARE THE GOLD STANDARD. AT WHICH ONES ARE HAVING THE MOST SUCCESS AND HOW ARE YOU DEFINING THAT SUCCESS AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS- HOW DOES THIS ALL. I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS TOPIC BECAUSE MY MOM. TWENTY YEARS AGO REPRESENT L. A. COUNTY AND L. A. COUNTY AND PORTIONS OF MY DISTRICT AT THE TIME SUFFERED FROM. A HOSPITAL DESERT'S. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND WE DID HAVE. ONE OF THESE COMPANIES THAT YES- WE HAD A TO FINALLY IN MY DISTRICT COME IN. THAT DO YOU KNOW THAT ARE THAT ARE LARGER CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE COME IN AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THEM. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE HEALTH HAZARDS AND WE STILL ARE SUFFERING I THINK NOT YOU KNOW FROM THE APP FROM A LOW AVERAGE ON HEALTH CARE AVAILABILITY IN OUR DISTRICT. AND SO. MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT AFFECT DISTRICTS LIKE MINE. WHERE WE STRUGGLE WITH ACCESS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE PRICES THE PRICES ARE BAD ENOUGH BUT BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO COME. OR THAT WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND THOSE THAT WILL COME TO OUR DISTRICTS AND. BUT THANK YOU THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS SO IN TERMS OF THE STATES THAT ARE HAVING THE MOST SUCCESS- I WOULD I WOULD PICK OUT MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND IN SOME WAYS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS MASSACHUSETTS- WITH ITS HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION REALLY HAS- THE BEST OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ITS MARKETS. AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THEIR- THEIR HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH. THRESHOLDS AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN- THAT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE THAT HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE ITS ACCESS TO DATA AND ITS ANALYSIS OF DATA TO PREVENT ANY COMPETITIVE MERGERS- IN CERTAIN INSTANCES BUT THEN ALSO TO ALLOW MERGERS THAT GOES WITH TO GO THROUGH BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS THAT- ARE GOING TO. HOPEFULLY PREVENT AT LEAST FOR SOME AMOUNT OF TIME OF THE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS ANY COMPETITIVE RESULTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER PLACES RHODE ISLAND HAS DONE THAT- THROUGH ITS AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW IT'S PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP AND REDUCE ITS OVERALL COST GROWTH. WHICH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PART BY HAVING USING THESE AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS AND ALLOWING THAT HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO REALLY. GO INTO AND REJECT THE CONTRACTS BETWEEN INSURERS AND PROVIDERS BASED ON THESE PREMIUM INCREASES AS WELL AS- REJECTING THE PROVIDER RATE AND SO THAT'S THAT THREAT BEING OUT THERE ALLOWS INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE. ON PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF PRICE AND THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE STUDY OF THAT SYSTEM THAT HAS SHOWN. A REDUCTION IN PRICE SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN- VERY EFFECTIVE. AS WELL IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW ALL OF THIS WITH HELP OF. THE COUNTIES IN WHICH YOU THE COUNTY IN WHICH YOU GREW UP AND WHERE THERE'S AYE HEALTHCARE DESERT WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THERE TO BE- THE ABILITY FOR NEW ENTRANTS TO COME INTO THE MARKET AND FOR THERE TO BE LOWER AM. IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR THOSE AND ENTITIES TO COMMITTING FOR COMPETITION TO COME IN AND A LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPENS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. FOR NEW PROVIDERS TO COME IN. BECAUSE THE DOMINANT PROVIDERS IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR IF THERE ARE- JUST REALLY LIMITED NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS THEY ARE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE. AT PREVENTING INSURERS FROM BEING ABLE TO. PAY THEM HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM OF KIND OF EXCLUDING RIVALS IN THIS SPACE- BY DOMINANT PROVIDERS AND SO. HAVING GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET CAN LOWER THE OVER ARCHING- THAT THRESHOLD OUR BOUNDARY FOR GETTING INTO THE MARKET FOR NEW COMPETITORS AND SO THAT CAN ALSO HELP IN THAT SPACE. GO AHEAD PLEASE. I GET THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT BUT I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE HOW DO YOU PAIR OF THAT TOO BECAUSE I MEAN I LIVE IN A DISTRICT THAT CLEARLY WE HAD A HOT WE HAD. TO HOSPITALS CLOSE AND SO WHAT WE WANTED IT WASN'T ACTUALLY POSSIBLE WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT. WE HAD NO HEALTH CARE- AND PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE CARS IT'S FOUR HOURS SOMETIMES ON A BUS TO GET HEALTH CARE AND THAT'S- NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT FOR MY FAMILY OR- THOSE AROUND ME MY NEIGHBORS- SO HOW DO WE PAIR OF THIS WHAT WE WANT WITH WHAT. WE ACTUALLY WHAT ACTUALLY FACILITATES NOT JUST THE HOPE THAT IT GIVES SPACE FOR THOSE TO COME IN WHO DO WHO WHAT REALLY DON'T REALLY WANT TO COME INTO OUR DISTRICTS. REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE LOW WE ARE NOT THE IDEAL SITUATION FOR MOST HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. UHHUH. DID YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR THE QUESTION. YES I CAN HEAR THE QUESTION OKAY. OPEN UP CAN YOU HEAR ME SORRY WE'RE HAVING AT. WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW I DELAY ON THAT ON THAT CAMERA MIGHT ANYWAY SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THE REALITY IS WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED WITH ONE- WITH ONE SOLUTION. I HONESTLY THINK THAT FOR RURAL MARKETS WHERE WE DON'T ARE JUST FOR AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE GOOD AND APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOLLOW THE LEAD OR LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT PENNSYLVANIA HAS DONE IN THAT SPACE BY CREATING. ESSENTIALLY TREATING TREATING HEALTH CARE IN THOSE SPACES LIKE A PUBLIC UTILITY AND SAY THAT THOUGH THEY HAVE CREATED BOTH A FLOOR AND A CEILING FOR WHAT COULD BE PAID WHAT THE STATE WOULD PAY. TO PROVIDE CARE AT IN THOSE SPACES AND THINKING ABOUT IT IN THE SAME WAY AS A PUBLIC UTILITY THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE AREAS NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY NEED ACCESS TO SCHOOLS THEY NEED ACCESS TO BE WANTING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WE WANT THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS AND THEY'RE- WANTING TAXES THE TELEPHONE LINES. I'M SO TREATING HEALTH CARE IN MORE RURAL AREAS IN HEALTH CARE DESERT AS A PUBLIC ENTITY AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDED WITH A CERTAIN FLOOR FOR AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT CAN REALLY CHANGE THE DYNAMC IN THAT SPACE AND ENCOURAGE ENTRANCE. ENTITIES TO ENTER AND I THINK THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IT'S A IT'S AN ANTI BUT YOU HAVE TO TREAT SORT OF THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER REAS. THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR AN ANSWER. MISTER NAZARIAN QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU I'M HI I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I'M GONNA GO BACK IN TO YOUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION AND I'VE I'VE NEGLECTED TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT I I'M I'M VERY CURIOUS- YOU HAD A SLIGHT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY- AND- CALIFORNIA GETS A D. OREGON GETS A C. WASHINGTON GETS A D. BUT MADE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE GET ON A- WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. THERE WERE NOT DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE BEEN- THE LEADERS IN HEALTHCARE PRICE TRANSPARENCY AND THEY HAVE FOR YEARS. AND PART OF WHAT THEY DO THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AS THEY HAVE PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO ONLINE. AND PUT IN THEIR HEALTH PLAN AT LEAST IN. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THEY HAVE THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN GO ONLINE PUT IN THEIR HEALTH PLAN- AND- FIND OUT HOW MUCH A CERTAIN PROCEDURE IS GOING COST. A DIFFERENT FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE AND SO THAT IS AND IT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. FOR THEM AND IT OFFERS THAT THE PATIENTS MUCH MORE- TRANSPARENCY INTO THAT SPACE THEY MADE VERY EFFECTIVE USE OF THEIR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASES. THEY ALSO PROVIDE OF REPORTS AND INFORMATION TO POLICYMAKERS- AND TO THE PUBLIC BASED ON WHAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR DATABASE BUT THEY'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS AND WORKING ON IT FROM FOR MANY MANY YEARS. NOW THAT REPORT CARD IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS AND I THINK THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE WILL BE CHANGING IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND MAKING IT MUCH MORE- POLICY ENFORCEMENT RELATED SO THAT. THE- THE GRADATIONS WILL BE MADE ABOUT HOW MUCH INFORMATION GOES TO IS AVAILABLE ALSO TO POLICY MAKERS AND ACADEMICS AND OTHER PEOPLE NOT JUST CONSUMERS BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT IS THAT THEY HAVE PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET- INFORMATION IN REAL TIME HELPING THEM ESTIMATE HOW MUCH IT WILL BE FOR THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO GO TO PARTICULAR PROVIDERS. THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL QUITE FRANKLY I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY AT ONE POINT IN THE- HEARING WE HAD SAID IT'S- EASIER TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU WHAT YOU MIGHT PAY TO HAVE OUR DOG TREATED AT A VETERINARIAN. THAT IS WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE- AND THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT'S UNFORTUNATE SO- DO YOU DO YOU THINK. INCREASING PRICES. THROUGHOUT CONSOLIDATED MARKETS. HAS AN EFFECT ON INDEPENDENT PRACTICES THESE ARE SORT OF THAT WHICH ARE THERE AREN'T VERY MANY THESE DAYS OBVIOUSLY BUT- DO YOU THINK THERE'S A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT THERE BECAUSE- AS I WAS AN INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER- IN THE FIELD OF DENTISTRY. AND I COULDN'T JUST CALL OUT MY COMPETITOR AND SAY HEY WOULD YOU CHARGING FOR THIS- AND- THAT WAS THAT THAT'S AN ANTI TRUST VIOLATIONS SO. BUT IS THERE'S IS THE CONSOLIDATION LEADING TO AN UPTICK IN PRICES. WITH SMALL IT WITH WITH INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS VERSUS LARGE GROUPS AND SO ON. SO I THINK I THINK THAT THERE IS A GENERAL UPTICK SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT PROBE AT PHYSICIANS CAN'T JUST CALL UP AND FIND OUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE. ARE CHARGING BUT AS THE MARKET GOES UP OVERALL- WE ARE SEEING YOU KNOW PRICES RISE IN GENERAL ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE SEE THIS A FACT- WITH KAISER PERMANENTE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I REALIZE A VERY VERY LARGE PLAYER BUT THEY'RE NOT- BUT THEY HAVE. THEIR THEIR PRICES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SORT OF SHADOW PRICE WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING- IN SOME OF THE BIGGER SYSTEMS- AND THEIR LIVES TO THEIR HIGHER IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAN THEY ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT IS IN SOME WAYS TRUE NOW THE OTHER THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT FOR SOME INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A PART OF THE SYSTEM INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN PUSH DOWN ON THEIR PRICES PRETTY HEAVILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO REALLY PUSH BACK. AND SO YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT EFFECTS LIKE THEY MAY BE AS A WHOLE RAISING THEIR PRICES BUT THEY'RE GETTING PAID. LESS THAN THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT BE BECAUSE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN PUSH DOWN ON THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I AM. THEN THE OTHER IS GOOD SO I THINK THERE'S SORT OF. TWO SIDES OF THAT COIN THAT'S HAPPENING AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION. LET'S HAVE A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS IN IN THERE THEY SHOULD BE PRETTY QUICK- YOU MENTIONED IN IN YOUR AND OF THE FIVE STATE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I SAW A PHRASE COME UP I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE THAT'S THE CERTIFICATE OF NEED AGENCY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. YES SO CERTIFICATE OF NEED AGENCIES- ARE IN. I BELIEVE. THEY WERE VERY POPULAR IN THE NINETIES I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE PROBABLY IN LIKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY STATES NOW AND THEY WERE DESIGN WHEN A LOT OF HEALTH POLICY CONCERNS WERE AROUND UTILIZATION WE HAD FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICINE PEOPLE WERE PROVIDING LOTS MORE CARE AND THE- THE DATA WAS TELLING IN HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHERS THAT THE MORE BEDS THERE WERE THE MORE SURGERIES THAT WERE BEING DONE IN THE MORGUE CARE WAS BEING PROVIDED AND SO AS A AS A- AS A PRACTICE STATE START PASSING CERTIFICATE OF NEED LAWS. THAT WOULD REQUIRE BEFORE I HEALTH A HOSPITAL OR A HEALTH CARE ENTITY COULD EXPAND EITHER BY THROUGH ACQUISITION OR BY. BUILDING A NEW BUILDING THEY HAD TO GET A CERTIFICATE OF NEED SHOWING THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. TO- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEED IN THE COMMUNITY TO WARRANT THE INCREASE THAT AND SHE SAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T JUST BE EXPANDING UTILIZATION FOR NO NEED. NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THESE HAVE KIND OF FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR AND THE THOUGHT HAS BEEN OVER TIME THAT THEY WERE BEING USED IN ANY COMPETITIVE WAYS BECAUSE EXISTING HEALTH SYSTEMS COULD CHALLENGE. ARRIVALS CERTIFICATE OF NEED APPLICATION AND COULD COME IN AND THEY- THEY DON'T NEED THAT EXTRA BED SPACE WE'VE GOT IT COVERED HERE AND AS IT. AND AS A MECHANISM TO SORT OF KEEP MARKET POWER FROM GROWING UNDERNEATH THEIR RIVALS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT SOME STATES HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT USING THIS. APPROVAL PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE WITHIN THE STATE. TO THEN SAY WELL IF YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN THIS MERGER OR ACQUISITION WE HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT COMPETITION HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT PRICES AND THEY'VE USED IT TO COVER. COMPETITIVE CONCERNS AND THEY DO HAVE AN APPROVAL PROCESS IN PLACE TO SOME STATES ARE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BUT THAT'S SORT OF. THE HISTORY OF THEM THEY SORT OF FELL OUT OF FAVOR AND NOW THEY'RE BEING USED- AS A MECHANISM TO CONTROL CONSOLIDATION AND PRICES BY SOME STATES LIKE CONNECTICUT. GREAT THANK YOU. THEY MIGHT MY FINAL QUESTION AND- IT YOU KNOW WELL IT'S TO ME IT'S VERY CLEAR THE CONSOLIDATION IS LEADING TO HIGHER. HEALTHCARE PRICES- ARE YOU WHERE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE INFLUENCING THE RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS. SURE YES I MEAN I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT CONSOLIDATION IS THE ONLY DRIVER OF HEALTH CARE PRICES WOULD BE- NOT TOO I DO THINK THAT IT IS THE MAJOR DRIVER AND A MAJOR DRIVER BUT I THINK WE ALSO SEE- THAT PRICES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY. YOU KNOW THE COST OF OVERALL YOU KNOW THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE IN A CERTAIN AREA SO IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE JUST IN GENERAL TO PROVIDE TO HAVE. HOSPITALS AND RUN HOSPITALS IN A PLACE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO THAN IT IS- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY- IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO EXPENSIVE AND WE HAVE A POPULATION THAT IS NOT- MAYBE AS HEALTHY AS OTHER OPULATIONS AND SO THE CASE MIX IS IMPORTANT TO BE LOOKING AT. WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION THEIR RANGE OF THINGS PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS ARE REALLY DRIVING THE PRICE OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS ARE ALSO DRIVING HEALTHCARE. PRICES UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO I THINK TO SAY THAT THE ONLY THING THAT'S HAPPENING WITH HEALTH CARE PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES ITS COMPETITION- YOU KNOW IT IS JUST IS NOT CORRECT THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. BUT CONSOLIDATION AND COMPETITION IS A MAJOR FACTOR AND IT'S ONE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET CONTROL OVER- AS OPPOSED TO THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT OUR AGING POPULATION OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. WELL THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INSIGHTS ON THE INFORMATION- AND- I- BUT- FOR SHAPE OF YOU OF BEING THERE TO TESTIFY FOR US ODAY. AND THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN PERCENT- I WE WILL BE GOING INTO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT- SO- THERE WAS AN ERROR- ON OUR WEBSITE SO I DO WANT TO CALL OUT THE TELEPHONE NUMBER. AGAIN FOR PEOPLE CALLING IN AND THAT NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. AND- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- GET TRY TO GET THAT ON THE SCREEN AS AS WE CAN HERE SO. WHAT WE DO NOT DO ANY OTHER YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS HERE. OKAY I THINK PROCEED THIS IS BEEN DISCIPLINE VERY ENLIGHTENING AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION. AND WITH THE HELP COST OF HEALTH CARE RISING AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION- THAT'S A DISTURBING NUMBER- THE CONTINUES TO GO ON YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND- SO IT BEHOOVES US TO REALLY LOOK AT THE FACTORS THAT ARE- LEADING TO THAT. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT- CONSOLIDATION IS ONE OF THOSE FACTORS SO- WE WILL GO TO ARE MODERATED- OUR MODERATOR AND- ASK- ARE THERE- CALLERS WHO WHO WANTED WHO ARE CALLING IN WILL TRY TO LIMIT THE TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES. PER CALLER PLEASE. HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE ZERO FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE ILL GO TO A LINE OF FIFTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING HELLO DOCTOR WOULD DETERRED AND J. D. ASK ON BEHALF OF FTA YOU CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR ONGOING LEADERSHIP AND THE INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT OUR COMPLEX HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY EDUCATING. OTHER MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH AND YOU KNOW RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS THE CHIEF CONCERN AMONG OUR MEMBERS AND FAMILIES AS THEY STRUGGLE TO AFFORD TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE- AND ADDS UP DR KING OPEN. RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE ARE HOT ARE CAUGHT HI NEARLY THE LACK OF COMP. YOU TOO MORGAN. AND FRANKLY IN OUR OPINION DUE TO CORPORATE GREED AND A POWER GRAB OF CERTAIN SYSTEMS DOMINATE THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. ADDITIONALLY CONSOLIDATION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ACTUALLY LEADS TO RAPID WALKER LAY OFF AT THE COST CUTTING STRATEGY FOR THE CHOIR IN MERGING ENTITIES. AND ALL OF THAT SAID THIS IS WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO FIND BOLD SOLUTION TO CONFRONT AND ADDRESS NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CONSOLIDATION EXACTLY RESTORED SOME LEVEL OF COMPETITION BACK IN THE MARKET. WHICH AFTER ALL IS THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN FIXING MARKET FAILURES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF A P. C. D. WE APPRECIATE DR KING PRESENTATION HIGHLIGHTING DATA IS FOUNDATIONAL BUT ONE THING MISSING IS THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET PROVIDER LEVEL DATA AND MAKE THAT ACCEPTABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE COMPARISONS ON PRICE QUALITY. EQUITY AND ACCESS TO CARE. ADDITIONALLY WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN BY SENATOR MINING IT'S PAST SESSION WHICH WOULD HAVE SERVED A CRITICAL NEXT STEP IN RESTORING OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT. OVER HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION. I'VE YOU KNOW DOCTOR MANY SMALL SYSTEM LIKE HOSPITAL MEDICAL GROUPS. AND OTHER HAVE BEEN BY NOW HIT HARD BY THE CLOSURES DUE TO THE- MANY OF WHICH WILL AT AT RED FOR. CONTROL BY YOU. SUCH AS PROPERTY PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUND HI ALL OF WHICH WE WOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED ENTERING THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. BECAUSE OF THIS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS ON PROPOSALS THAT WILL BEING- CONSOLIDATING ENTITIES MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T INADVERTENTLY HAD NEGATIVE WORKED FOR IMPACT. THANK YOU. SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEKOOSA NEXT BETTER PLEASE. NEXT CALL SENATE WILL COME FROM WIND SIXTY YEAH IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS YES MEAN PALETTE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY TO SHINE A LIGHT ON HOW CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS ARE IMPACTED BY CONSOLIDATION IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY ROBUST ACTIVE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AS WELL AS NEWLY DEVELOPING SORT OF CASE LAW DEMONSTRATES THE CONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH HIGHER PRICES. AND NOT CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED QUALITY. STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT THE HIGHER THE DEGREE OF CONSOLIDATION OF HEALTH SYSTEMS THE HIGHER THE PREMIUMS PAID AND THE HIGHER THE COST OF VARIOUS PROCEDURES. MANY ENTITIES SEEKING TO MERGE CLAIMED THE CONSOLIDATION IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES AND OTHER QUALITY MEASURES BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IN ACADEMIC LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THESE CLIENTS.
