OF CARE.

00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:49.080 region:rollup2

SO THAT WOULD CHILD WELFARE

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:12.503 region:rollup2

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.994 region:rollup2
NOT CHANGE THAT. IN THE EVENT IN

00:41:33.925 --> 00:41:38.296 region:rollup2

02:05:05.765 --> 02:05:08.468 region:rollup2
MORE SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU'RE

TYPICALLY HAVE A LOWER RATE BUT

02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:22.749 region:rollup2
THESE MONTHLY FEES CAN BE

02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:25.017 region:rollup2
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY?

02:05:22.749 --> 02:05:26.986 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL NEED

A SIGNIFICANT RISK AND THAT TYPE

02:05:37.697 --> 02:05:41.834 region:rollup2
A CONTRACT DOES IS UNNECESSARY

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:43.903 region:rollup2

DOES THAT AS IT WOULD KINDA WORK

02:10:26.452 --> 02:10:29.622 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE BUDGET AND. JUST ONE

02:10:28.154 --> 02:10:31.190 region:rollup2
POINT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

02:10:29.622 --> 02:10:32.124 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BUDGETS AND HOW THAT THAT

02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:34.360 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT THE.

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:35.695 region:rollup2
THE FINANCES OF THE FACILITY.

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.697 region:rollup2
I THINK THESE ARE TWO KIND OF

02:10:35.695 --> 02:10:40.066 region:rollup2
SEPARATE THINGS ANNUAL BUDGETS

02:10:37.697 --> 02:10:42.368 region:rollup2
AND AUDITS LOOK AT. THE FORMER

02:10:40.066 --> 02:10:44.070 region:rollup2
FOR THE FORMAL FIND ARE THE YEAR

02:10:42.368 --> 02:10:45.304 region:rollup2
BEHIND US RIGHT THEY LOOK AT HOW

02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:46.672 region:rollup2
WE DID THIS YEAR HOW THE

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:48.174 region:rollup2
FINANCES LOOKED.

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:50.309 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT

02:10:48.174 --> 02:10:52.011 region:rollup2
NOW AN ACTUARIAL STUDIES ARE

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:53.612 region:rollup2
FORWARD THINKING AND THEY LOOK

02:10:52.011 --> 02:10:57.350 region:rollup2
AT PROJECTIONS OF.

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:58.884 region:rollup2
POPULATION PROJECTIONS COST

02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:00.119 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS ON.

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:02.555 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SEVERAL OTHER THINGS

02:11:00.119 --> 02:11:04.123 region:rollup2
THAT HELP ANALYZE THE FORWARD

02:11:02.555 --> 02:11:05.725 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THE FORD FINANCIAL

02:11:04.123 --> 02:11:07.126 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE CCRC

02:11:05.725 --> 02:11:09.862 region:rollup2
MAC MIGHT FACE DOWN THE ROAD.

02:11:07.126 --> 02:11:12.732 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE RISKS ARE WAY.

02:11:09.862 --> 02:11:14.467 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY WINDOWS HEAD IF THE

02:11:12.732 --> 02:11:16.469 region:rollup2
CCRC ISN'T PLANNING AHEAD FOR

02:11:14.467 --> 02:11:18.404 region:rollup2
THOSE KIND OF THINGS. THE HEAD

02:11:16.469 --> 02:11:19.638 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS FINE IS A FINANCIAL

02:11:18.404 --> 02:11:22.074 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON THE RESIDENTS BECAUSE

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:23.109 region:rollup2
AS WE KNOW. THE RESIDENTS THERE

02:11:22.074 --> 02:11:24.710 region:rollup2
AT THEIR MONTHLY FEES CAN

02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:25.745 region:rollup2
INCREASE BASED ON OPERATION

02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:27.313 region:rollup2
COSTS INCREASE IN OTHER

02:11:25.745 --> 02:11:29.348 region:rollup2
INCREASES THAT SYNTHESISER

02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:31.350 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. HAS AND IF THEY HAVE

02:11:29.348 --> 02:11:32.351 region:rollup2
AN ANTICIPATED THOSE THEN THAT

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:34.453 region:rollup2
INCREASED MAY FALL ON THE

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:36.155 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS SO WE SEE THAT THE

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:38.891 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BENEFITS ABOUT FAR

02:11:36.155 --> 02:11:43.129 region:rollup2
OUTWEIGHING. ON ANY NOMINAL COST

02:11:38.891 --> 02:11:44.497 region:rollup2
THAT THE ACTUARIAL STUDY WOULD

02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:47.166 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ON THAT RESIDENTS.

02:11:44.497 --> 02:11:48.667 region:rollup2
SOME FINAL QUESTIONS ARE.

02:11:47.166 --> 02:11:51.570 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME AGO WAS OPEN UPON A

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:53.239 region:rollup2
TIME I SERVED AS A. THOSE SMALL

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:55.808 region:rollup2
LOW HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION BOARD

02:11:53.239 --> 02:11:58.410 region:rollup2
MEMBER.

02:11:55.808 --> 02:12:00.813 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ARE ALWAYS TO ANNUAL.

02:11:58.410 --> 02:12:04.083 region:rollup2
AND A MANAGEMENT COMPANY GIVEN

02:12:00.813 --> 02:12:05.551 region:rollup2
MONTHLY THAT REPORT COCA.

02:12:04.083 --> 02:12:06.452 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY UP COMMONSENSE A

02:12:05.551 --> 02:12:08.421 region:rollup2
INCLUDED DATA.

02:12:06.452 --> 02:12:10.823 region:rollup2
HE OUT REPLACEMENT COST AND THE

02:12:08.421 --> 02:12:13.359 region:rollup2
RESERVATIONS. AND THE.

02:12:10.823 --> 02:12:15.861 region:rollup2
THE STREET OF A READ PAVEMENT

02:12:13.359 --> 02:12:18.531 region:rollup2
DATA ETCETERA ETCETERA.

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:20.833 region:rollup2
SEWER ANY A AND T. WHY THEY

02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:21.367 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT THE INCLUDE PROJECT

02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:23.335 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE HAVE TO BE

02:12:21.367 --> 02:12:26.038 region:rollup2
COSTLY.

02:12:23.335 --> 02:12:28.607 region:rollup2
SOUNDTRACKER ACTUARIAL STUDY

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:29.208 region:rollup2
SALVO.

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:40.419 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW PROBABLY AND THE

02:12:29.208 --> 02:12:45.624 region:rollup2
LIST SUPPORT SO IT IT.

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:47.893 region:rollup2
IT HAS SAY SOMEONE VALUE ONCE

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:50.396 region:rollup2
YOU SUBMIT TO DR SOCIAL SERVICE

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:55.601 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THE. WORD SOMEBODY

02:12:50.396 --> 02:12:58.637 region:rollup2
STUDY AND THEY. AND A AND ARE

02:12:55.601 --> 02:13:01.974 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE SOMEBODY STUDY

02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:05.878 region:rollup2
THAT FACTORY OR STUDIES OUT OF.

02:13:01.974 --> 02:13:10.282 region:rollup2
AND DOES SOME SOME PROBLEMATIC

02:13:05.878 --> 02:13:16.355 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOUND THE. OF IN THAT

02:13:10.282 --> 02:13:17.656 region:rollup2
STUDY SOMEONE HAS TO FOLLOW UP.

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:21.694 region:rollup2
P. ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT THAT

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:21.994 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON YOUR

02:13:21.694 --> 02:13:23.295 region:rollup2
BODY THAT.

02:13:21.994 --> 02:13:25.631 region:rollup2
THE.

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:27.266 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A SUCH A MECHANISM

02:13:25.631 --> 02:13:28.734 region:rollup2
SO THAT'LL BE AMADOR INCREASE

02:13:27.266 --> 02:13:37.343 region:rollup2
OUT OF OUR.

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:38.944 region:rollup2
AT JUST OF FOR DOING IT THIS OUT

02:13:37.343 --> 02:13:41.380 region:rollup2
FOR I MEAN.

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:46.652 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO HAVE IT HAS TO COST

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:49.421 region:rollup2
SOME ACTION FROM THAT STUDY.

02:13:46.652 --> 02:13:53.259 region:rollup2
IF I HAD RECEIVED A STAR ACT

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:58.631 region:rollup2
OREOS ACTIVITY JUSTIFY LIT

02:13:53.259 --> 02:13:59.298 region:rollup2
WALKED Y. SOMEBODY HAS TO STUDY.

02:13:58.631 --> 02:14:02.368 region:rollup2
AND THE COME UP WITH THE HEY YOU

02:13:59.298 --> 02:14:04.303 region:rollup2
PASS.

02:14:02.368 --> 02:14:06.705 region:rollup2
NO URINE PASS IN SOME FOLLOW UP

02:14:04.303 --> 02:14:08.240 region:rollup2
ACTION.

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:09.608 region:rollup2
GOOD IF I IF I MAJOR THE SO THAT

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:10.442 region:rollup2
ACTUARIAL STUDY WOULD BE

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:12.111 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ONCE IT WAS FINISHED BY

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:13.178 region:rollup2
THE ACTUARY PROVIDED TO THAT

02:14:12.111 --> 02:14:14.280 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS BUT IT WOULD BE GIVEN

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:16.482 region:rollup2
TO THE PROVIDERS BOARD AND THAT

02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.982 region:rollup2
BODY WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE

02:14:16.482 --> 02:14:18.350 region:rollup2
THAT AND LOOK OUT AND.

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:19.418 region:rollup2
AND USE THOSE PROJECTIONS IN

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:22.855 region:rollup2
THEIR IN THEIR BUDGETING AND IN

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:25.658 region:rollup2
THEIR DECISION MAKING MOVING

02:14:22.855 --> 02:14:27.259 region:rollup2
FORWARD AS THE CCRC BOARD.

02:14:25.658 --> 02:14:29.728 region:rollup2
A SO SO THAT MINNESOTA IN

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:32.498 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THE OPERATORS SO

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:34.300 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COST TO PUT A STUDY.

02:14:32.498 --> 02:14:34.767 region:rollup2
BUT THE SORT OF SERVICE

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:36.435 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ITSELF FOR

02:14:34.767 --> 02:14:38.470 region:rollup2
MONITORING.

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:40.272 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE.

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:41.774 region:rollup2
IT'S NOW AND THE FOLLOW UP

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:45.411 region:rollup2
ACTIONS SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT

02:14:41.774 --> 02:14:46.145 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THE COST OF THE

02:14:45.411 --> 02:14:49.415 region:rollup2
SOCIAL DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL

02:14:46.145 --> 02:14:50.516 region:rollup2
SERVICE DEPARTMENT OPERATION

02:14:49.415 --> 02:14:52.084 region:rollup2
COST HOW MUCH DATA COOPER.

02:14:50.516 --> 02:14:53.152 region:rollup2
SO THE BOARD RIGHT NOW RECEIVES

02:14:52.084 --> 02:14:55.254 region:rollup2
THESE REPORTS THE ACTUARIAL

02:14:53.152 --> 02:14:55.888 region:rollup2
STUDIES FROM ANY CCRC THE OFFERS

02:14:55.254 --> 02:14:56.555 region:rollup2
THAT TYPE A CONTRACT TO THEIR

02:14:55.888 --> 02:14:57.456 region:rollup2
ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO ACTUARIAL

02:14:56.555 --> 02:14:58.457 region:rollup2
STUDIES. SO THIS WOULD JUST FALL

02:14:57.456 --> 02:14:58.991 region:rollup2
IN THAT SAME LINE IN THE SENSE

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:03.028 region:rollup2
THAT LOOK AT THOSE ANNUAL

02:14:58.991 --> 02:15:04.129 region:rollup2
REPORTS IN

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:06.832 region:rollup2
THE FILE THEM. THERE'S NO.

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:08.267 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO PASS OR FAIL AYE AYE

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:11.136 region:rollup2
GUESSES BUT A GOOD WAY OF

02:15:08.267 --> 02:15:12.037 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING THAT THE IF THE. THE

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:14.039 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT DOES A PASS OR FAIL A

02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:14.506 region:rollup2
CCRC BASED ON WHAT THE ACTUARIAL

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:15.674 region:rollup2
STUDY.

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:17.176 region:rollup2
STUDY COMES BACK WITH.

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:19.178 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A TOOL THAT

02:15:17.176 --> 02:15:21.080 region:rollup2
THE CCRC COULD USE IN THEIR

02:15:19.178 --> 02:15:22.314 region:rollup2
FUTURE PLANNING AND AND AND AND

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:23.916 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PLANNING IN OUTLOOK.

02:15:22.314 --> 02:15:25.618 region:rollup2
AS THEY LOOKED. BUDGETS DOWN

02:15:23.916 --> 02:15:28.320 region:rollup2
THE ROAD.

AFTERNOON.

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:37.089 region:rollup2
START OFF BY THINKING OF THE

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:38.891 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK IN

02:16:37.089 --> 02:16:40.959 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS.

02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:42.361 region:rollup2
HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS CLAIMED

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:43.629 region:rollup2
COUNTLESS LIVES IT'S BEEN AN

02:16:42.361 --> 02:16:45.864 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:46.732 region:rollup2
IN THIS BUILDING FOR. A COUPLE

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:48.167 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW.

02:16:46.732 --> 02:16:49.568 region:rollup2
WE WEREN'T MAKING MUCH OF A

02:16:48.167 --> 02:16:50.536 region:rollup2
DENT YET AND WE KNOW THAT

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:51.804 region:rollup2
THERE'S MILLIONS OF KIDS OUT

02:16:50.536 --> 02:16:52.838 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A

02:16:51.804 --> 02:16:54.306 region:rollup2
STATE HAS COMMITTED.

02:16:52.838 --> 02:16:55.708 region:rollup2
.

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:57.042 region:rollup2
AND ONE IS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:16:55.708 --> 02:16:58.444 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DONE NOW IS WE'VE WE

02:16:57.042 --> 02:17:00.446 region:rollup2
DECRIMINALIZE IT WOULD SAY THAT

02:16:58.444 --> 02:17:02.247 region:rollup2
THAT KIDS CAN'T BE THAT HARD

02:17:00.446 --> 02:17:03.549 region:rollup2
WITH THE CRIME IF THEY'RE UNDER.

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:05.250 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN WHICH WE ALL AGREE WITH

02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:06.452 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT WE

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:08.487 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FOR THESE KIDS AND IT

02:17:06.452 --> 02:17:09.988 region:rollup2
IS ONE THING TO BE ABLE TO SAVE

02:17:08.487 --> 02:17:11.790 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY FROM A REALLY BAD HUMAN

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:13.425 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING SITUATION? BUT IF WE

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:14.526 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE REALLY GOOD SERVICES

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:16.528 region:rollup2
THAN TO TREAT THEM WHEN THEY

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:17.729 region:rollup2
COME OUT THESE ARE. KIDS

02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:18.297 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES OF BRAINS LOOK LIKE

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:20.766 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN IN A WAR ZONE

02:17:18.297 --> 02:17:22.768 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE TRAUMA

02:17:20.766 --> 02:17:23.736 region:rollup2
IS THAT THEY'VE ENCOUNTERED

BE TO START COMMUNICATING AND

02:26:02.354 --> 02:26:06.658 region:rollup2

02:54:55.352 --> 02:54:58.621 region:rollup2
NO SUCH REGULATION.

02:54:57.087 --> 02:55:01.491 region:rollup2
A GOOD QUESTION I'M GOING TO ASK

02:54:58.621 --> 02:55:03.226 region:rollup2
MS COOLED IF SHE WILL SURE

02:55:01.491 --> 02:55:03.827 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THAT ARGUES MONTHS

02:55:03.226 --> 02:55:04.427 region:rollup2
NOTHING GOLD REPRESENTING SIX

02:55:03.827 --> 02:55:05.996 region:rollup2
BEDS.

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:07.630 region:rollup2
I'M OUR OBJECTIVE WITH THE BILL

02:55:05.996 --> 02:55:09.933 region:rollup2
IS TO.

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:10.900 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY CLARITY

02:55:09.933 --> 02:55:12.335 region:rollup2
WHAT WE GET WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:14.037 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THAT I HAD A PERSONAL

02:55:12.335 --> 02:55:16.573 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WERE OF LOOKING FOR A

02:55:14.037 --> 02:55:17.774 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR MY MOM. AYE BECAUSE OF

02:55:16.573 --> 02:55:18.942 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF REPRESENTING SIX

02:55:17.774 --> 02:55:21.277 region:rollup2
BEDS I KNEW THE NAME OF THE

02:55:18.942 --> 02:55:22.746 region:rollup2
FACILITY THAT I WANTED TO GO TO.

02:55:21.277 --> 02:55:24.848 region:rollup2
I WENT ONLINE AND I WENT THROUGH

02:55:22.746 --> 02:55:26.516 region:rollup2
SIX GOOGLE PAGE SEARCHES WHERE

02:55:24.848 --> 02:55:28.818 region:rollup2
WAS ONE. ONE LISTING AFTER

02:55:26.516 --> 02:55:30.053 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WITH A PICTURE OF A HOME

02:55:28.818 --> 02:55:32.689 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING AS IF IT WAS THE

HOME I WAS LOOKING FOR I CALLED

02:55:32.689 --> 02:55:35.258 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS INSTEAD REFERRAL

02:55:33.256 --> 02:55:37.293 region:rollup2
AGENCY. AND SO OUR CONCERN IS

02:55:35.258 --> 02:55:38.795 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL AND THERE IS NOT AN

02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:40.230 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO

02:55:38.795 --> 02:55:41.564 region:rollup2
BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONDITION

02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:42.532 region:rollup2
OF THE PERSON THEY'RE PLACING.

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:43.733 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN A

02:55:42.532 --> 02:55:45.535 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR THEM HAVE ANY

FAMILIARITY WITH THE FACILITY TO

02:55:45.535 --> 02:55:48.905 region:rollup2
PLACING THEM IN THE BACK AND ONE

02:55:47.537 --> 02:55:50.807 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMITTEES.

02:55:48.905 --> 02:55:52.675 region:rollup2
A REFERRAL AGENCY THATWAS NOT

02:55:50.807 --> 02:55:54.144 region:rollup2
A PLACE FOR MOM SAID I CAN'T

02:55:52.675 --> 02:55:54.744 region:rollup2
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

02:55:54.144 --> 02:55:56.846 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT WORK IN NEW

02:55:54.744 --> 02:55:58.348 region:rollup2
JERSEY. WE THINK THAT DOESN'T

02:55:56.846 --> 02:56:00.583 region:rollup2
MATTER WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE

02:55:58.348 --> 02:56:01.951 region:rollup2
TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOM

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:03.453 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLACE YOU'RE

02:56:01.951 --> 02:56:05.822 region:rollup2
PLACING HER SO THAT IT'S AN

02:56:03.453 --> 02:56:08.491 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP AND

02:56:05.822 --> 02:56:10.727 region:rollup2
THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FEE

02:56:08.491 --> 02:56:11.361 region:rollup2
IS TRUE.

02:56:10.727 --> 02:56:11.661 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT THEY ARE THEY ARE

02:56:11.361 --> 02:56:12.829 region:rollup2
ON.

02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:13.730 region:rollup2
THEY ADVERTISE THAT IT'S FREE.

02:56:12.829 --> 02:56:14.931 region:rollup2
IT'S TRUE IT'S FREE TO THE

02:56:13.730 --> 02:56:15.932 region:rollup2
PERSON THEY'RE PLACING BUT IT

02:56:14.931 --> 02:56:16.499 region:rollup2
THERE FOR A SIX BED FACILITY IF

02:56:15.932 --> 02:56:16.966 region:rollup2
IT'S A MONTH OR MONTH AND A

02:56:16.499 --> 02:56:17.634 region:rollup2
HALF.

02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:18.635 region:rollup2
RENT WE HAVE TO PAY THE REFERRAL

02:56:17.634 --> 02:56:19.302 region:rollup2
AGENCY WE THINK THAT THE PERSON

02:56:18.635 --> 02:56:20.670 region:rollup2
BEING PLACED SHOULD KNOW THAT

02:56:19.302 --> 02:56:21.371 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR THAT

02:56:20.670 --> 02:56:22.972 region:rollup2
EIGHT THAT AGENCY TO REFER THEM

02:56:21.371 --> 02:56:24.707 region:rollup2
TO PARTICULAR HOME BECAUSE OF

02:56:22.972 --> 02:56:25.208 region:rollup2
THAT FEET. AND SO THEY'RE

02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:26.810 region:rollup2
STRAINING IN THE BELL.

02:56:25.208 --> 02:56:27.410 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL HELP TO MAKE SURE

02:56:26.810 --> 02:56:28.945 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE

02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:30.113 region:rollup2
CONDITION AND I BELIEVE THIS

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:31.614 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO HAVE A

02:56:30.113 --> 02:56:33.216 region:rollup2
FAMILIARITY WITH THE FACILITY

02:56:31.614 --> 02:56:33.850 region:rollup2
THEIR PLACE IN THE RESIDENT

02:56:33.216 --> 02:56:34.584 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

02:56:33.850 --> 02:56:35.885 region:rollup2
EXIST TODAY.

02:56:34.584 --> 02:56:37.954 region:rollup2
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE SO

02:56:35.885 --> 02:56:40.223 region:rollup2
SCREENING PROCEDURE IN THIS BILL

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:41.691 region:rollup2
THAT THE HARLEM MY SERVICE TO MY

02:56:40.223 --> 02:56:43.927 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF TI FACILITIES ARE

02:56:41.691 --> 02:56:46.362 region:rollup2
I'M ABOUT TO RECOMMEND TO MY

02:56:43.927 --> 02:56:47.096 region:rollup2
CLIENTS A TRAINING REQUIREMENT

02:56:46.362 --> 02:56:49.332 region:rollup2
YES.

02:56:47.096 --> 02:56:50.533 region:rollup2
WHO'S GONNA DO TRAINING.

02:56:49.332 --> 02:56:52.302 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT WAS TRAINER CRIME

02:56:50.533 --> 02:56:53.770 region:rollup2
EITHER THROUGH DSS OR OUTSIDE

02:56:52.302 --> 02:56:55.438 region:rollup2
SOURCES WITH DSS WOULD BE THE

02:56:53.770 --> 02:56:56.840 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO ENSURE

02:56:55.438 --> 02:56:58.942 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING IS ADEQUATE

02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:59.809 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE.

02:56:58.942 --> 02:57:01.177 region:rollup2
IT'S A REGISTRATION PROCESS

02:56:59.809 --> 02:57:02.345 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:03.980 region:rollup2
ONE REASON WE BELIEVE THE

02:57:02.345 --> 02:57:05.548 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR VETOED A PREVIOUS BILL

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:07.083 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS A LICENSING DEL

02:57:05.548 --> 02:57:08.418 region:rollup2
WHICH ADDED EXTENSIVE COST SO

02:57:07.083 --> 02:57:10.086 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY IT'S A REGISTRATION

02:57:08.418 --> 02:57:11.354 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THAT

02:57:10.086 --> 02:57:13.389 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY OR INTENT IS GOOD

02:57:11.354 --> 02:57:15.024 region:rollup2
BUT DOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:19.395 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THIS PSALM.

02:57:15.024 --> 02:57:22.799 region:rollup2

RECEIVE FREE OR LOW COST CARE.

03:04:07.937 --> 03:04:11.274 region:rollup2
SO MEDICAL CONSULTATION IS

03:04:09.939 --> 03:04:12.742 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO

03:04:11.274 --> 03:04:14.010 region:rollup2
INCREASE

03:04:12.742 --> 03:04:16.012 region:rollup2

THE CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS.

03:04:45.741 --> 03:04:49.345 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO SHARE JUST ONE

03:04:47.677 --> 03:04:50.880 region:rollup2
STORY WITH YOU TAKE THIS IS A

03:04:49.345 --> 03:04:52.615 region:rollup2

CONSULTATION QUE.

03:04:52.615 --> 03:04:56.118 region:rollup2
JACKSON CAME INTO THE CLASSROOM

03:04:54.283 --> 03:04:58.054 region:rollup2
WITH THE HISTORY THAT REALLY NO

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:59.588 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD NEVER HAVE.

03:04:58.054 --> 03:05:00.489 region:rollup2
WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A A

03:04:59.588 --> 03:05:02.058 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE LEARNING FOUNDATION

03:05:00.489 --> 03:05:03.759 region:rollup2
FOR HIM.

03:05:02.058 --> 03:05:05.494 region:rollup2
IN MOMENTS OF DISTRESS

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:07.363 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD SEE HIM KICK SCREAM

03:05:05.494 --> 03:05:09.465 region:rollup2
BITE AND HIT.

03:05:07.363 --> 03:05:10.800 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE HAD REALLY BECOME

03:05:09.465 --> 03:05:12.435 region:rollup2
THE NORM AND NOW HE WAS

03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:14.136 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING IN THIS CLASSROOM.

03:05:12.435 --> 03:05:15.571 region:rollup2
SO. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A CLIMATE

03:05:14.136 --> 03:05:17.006 region:rollup2
OF STRESS THAT HAD REALLY

03:05:15.571 --> 03:05:20.176 region:rollup2
STARTED TO TO.

03:05:17.006 --> 03:05:21.344 region:rollup2
OVERSHADOW THE CLASSROOM AND

03:05:20.176 --> 03:05:22.645 region:rollup2
THE TEACHERS ALTHOUGH VERY

03:05:21.344 --> 03:05:23.546 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED

03:05:22.645 --> 03:05:25.314 region:rollup2
THEY WERE PHILLY PUSHED TO THE

03:05:23.546 --> 03:05:27.149 region:rollup2
EDGE AND THEIR ABILITY TO REALLY

03:05:25.314 --> 03:05:29.352 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SUPPORT. AND THEY WANTED

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:30.953 region:rollup2
TO TRULY TAP INTO HIS POTENTIAL

03:05:29.352 --> 03:05:32.521 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH CLOUDED HE WAS STILL

03:05:30.953 --> 03:05:33.990 region:rollup2
VERY CREATIVE HE WAS REALLY

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:34.957 region:rollup2
PLAYFUL AND THEY WANTED TO

03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:36.392 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT.

03:05:34.957 --> 03:05:37.860 region:rollup2
SO THE CONSULTANTS AND

03:05:36.392 --> 03:05:39.395 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH THE PARENTS

03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:41.664 region:rollup2
AND THE TEACHERS WERE ABLE TO

03:05:39.395 --> 03:05:42.631 region:rollup2
JOIN TOGETHER AND IDENTIFIED

03:05:41.664 --> 03:05:44.567 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD JACKSON'S.

03:05:42.631 --> 03:05:46.202 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THEY

03:05:44.567 --> 03:05:46.802 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED A JOINT MENTAL HEALTH

03:05:46.202 --> 03:05:48.537 region:rollup2
ENHANCED.

03:05:46.802 --> 03:05:49.438 region:rollup2
BE ABLE PLAN FOR HIM SUPPORT

03:05:48.537 --> 03:05:51.407 region:rollup2
PLAN.

03:05:49.438 --> 03:05:52.775 region:rollup2
SO THROUGHOUT SOMETIME WITH

03:05:51.407 --> 03:05:54.110 region:rollup2
COLOR COLLABORATION CAN YOU TENT

03:05:52.775 --> 03:05:55.878 region:rollup2
CONTINUING AND THE PERSISTENCE

03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:57.513 region:rollup2
OF THE TEACHER THE CONSULTANTS

03:05:55.878 --> 03:05:58.914 region:rollup2
AND THE PARENTS.

03:05:57.513 --> 03:06:00.483 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S THE POINT WHERE

03:05:58.914 --> 03:06:02.451 region:rollup2
JACKSON WAS MUCH MORE CALM IN

03:06:00.483 --> 03:06:04.120 region:rollup2
THE CLASSROOM WAS ABLE TO

03:06:02.451 --> 03:06:06.288 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN LEARNING AND

03:06:04.120 --> 03:06:07.990 region:rollup2
HIS OVERALL HOME.

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:09.358 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WITH BOTH HIS PEERS

03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:11.093 region:rollup2
AND HIS TEACHERS WERE MUCH MORE

03:06:09.358 --> 03:06:12.361 region:rollup2
POSITIVE.

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:14.196 region:rollup2
SO THIS REALLY ALLOWED THE

03:06:12.361 --> 03:06:15.765 region:rollup2
ENTIRE CLASS TO REFOCUS THEIR

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:17.600 region:rollup2
THEIR ENERGY INTO THE JOY OF

03:06:15.765 --> 03:06:19.635 region:rollup2
REALLY LEARNING.

03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:20.770 region:rollup2
SO PARTS OF CONSULTATION JACKSON

03:06:19.635 --> 03:06:21.470 region:rollup2
REALLY WAS ON THE PATH TOWARDS

03:06:20.770 --> 03:06:23.706 region:rollup2
X..

03:06:21.470 --> 03:06:25.007 region:rollup2
EXPULSION.

03:06:23.706 --> 03:06:27.176 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION

03:06:25.007 --> 03:06:28.944 region:rollup2
REALLY TRANSFORMED THAT FORK FOR

03:06:27.176 --> 03:06:30.713 region:rollup2
JACKSON.

03:06:28.944 --> 03:06:32.515 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS JUST ONE STORY BUT

03:06:30.713 --> 03:06:34.183 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER

03:06:32.515 --> 03:06:35.351 region:rollup2

THIS

03:06:37.319 --> 03:06:39.488 region:rollup2
SO I JUST THINK YOU FOR YOUR

03:06:38.054 --> 03:06:40.322 region:rollup2

THING THAT ANYONE IS IN

03:06:47.463 --> 03:06:51.801 region:rollup2
