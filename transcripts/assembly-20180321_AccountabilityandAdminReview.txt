AB IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OFF TODAY. BUT ALSO TAKING. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY THREE EGGMAN OFF CONSENT SO I'LL BE PRESENTING THAT BILL MYSELF. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PRESENTING AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO. THAT IS THE STATE GRANTS ADMINISTRATOR AT. CA BILL I WANTED TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THINKING THE CHAIRING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THE SPELL. NONPROFITS RANKED AS THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYING NEARLY ONE MILLION PEOPLE AND PRODUCING MORE JOBS THAN CONSTRUCTION FINANCE AND REAL ESTATE INDUSTRIES. FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GRANTS MAKE UP HALF OF THE NONPROFIT REVENUE MAKING THIS FUNDING SOURCE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE INDUSTRY IT IS ALSO AN INDUSTRY THAT WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT NONPROFITS CAN ACCESS TO IDENTIFY STATE GRANTS THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY NONPROFITS TO FIND THE INFORMATION THEY NEED ABOUT STATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS UNDERSERVED AND RURAL COMMUNITIES MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO COMPETE. FOR AND PURSUE HERE STATE FUNDS BY MAKING CALIFORNIA GRANTS ACCESSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT WE CAN ENSURE ALL INTERESTED ENTITIES HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT STATE FUNDING. WITH ME TODAY HAVE JENNIFER FEARING REPRESENTING THE COW NONPROFITS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THINK YOU'RE MUCH MISSED DURING THE MORNING THAT I'M SHARON MEMBERS JENNIFER HEARING ON BEHALF OF COUNT ON PROFITS AND ARE I'M STATEWIDE POLICY ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS AND. I WILL NOT REPEAT THE EXTENT ARGUMENTS MEAN I'M MADE BY THE AUTHOR BUT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THIS BILLS OBJECTIVES AND WE'RE OPTIMISTIC. ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS FOR CREATING NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS FOR OUR STATES NONPROFITS TO HELP THE FILL THE STATE'S OBJECTIVES AND WE ARE DRIVE OF. WONDERFUL MANY OVEN SPEAKING IN SUPPORT TODAY. ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS LOVELY BILL. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS OR COMMITTEE APPROVAL IS BEEN MOVED. SECOND US OPEN IT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT AND FOR SOMEONE WHO ALSO REPRESENTS AN AREA THAT IS OFTEN UNDERSERVED THIS ABILITY TO HAVE THE GRANTS WILL PEOPLE CAN SEE THEM GOING ON IN TWO QUICK WEB SEARCHES. TO FIND THINGS THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR A LOT OF MONEY OUT THERE WE KNOW IT DISPROPORTIONATELY GOES TO HIGHER INCOME AREAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROFESSIONAL GRANT WRITERS AND PEOPLE TO CALL THROUGH AND FIND THE GRANT SO. I THINK THIS IS THAT THAT BRIDGE THAT WE NEED TO DO TO OUR COMMUNITIES ANNA AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT I THINK THIS MAKES IT MORE MUCH MORE STREAMLINED. A FOR ALL PARTS OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED AND REAR FOR TO THE COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS. THAT MONTH EGGMAN BY THAT AMOUNT IS EGGMAN AYE PATTERSON. BURKE. SAID ABUNDANCE. LACKEY A LACKEY AYE MEDINA. MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. THE BILL IS OUT AND WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT I THINK VERY MUCH THE WORK. MISTER OBERNOLTE. MISTER OBERNOLTE HAS ONE BILL ON CONSENT I'M ASSUMING HE'S NOT GONNA PRESENT. THANK YOU A RIGHT AND THE OTHER BILL IS AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE STATE CONTRACT ACTS REQUIRES THAT ALL CONTRACTS FOR VALUES OF OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BE PUT OUT TO BID AND THAT THE CONTRACT BE AWARDED. TO THE LOWEST RESPONSIVE BIDDER. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF THAT ACT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ARE TGS. LOCAL AGENCIES MAY APPLY TO DIGEST FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM THAT REQUIREMENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOR GOOD CAUSE. LAST YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUED A REPORT. THAT. INVESTIGATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH TGS HAD BEEN GRANTING THOSE REQUESTS AND THE REPORT FOUND THAT THE GS COULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB ADMINISTERING THAT PROGRAM. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE DOING A GOOD JOB OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THOSE REQUESTS AND THE AUDITOR. ISSUED SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THIS BILL AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN IMPLEMENTS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IT REQUIRES TGS TO CREATE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. OF ALL REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS TO THAT REQUIREMENT OF BIDS OVER VALUED OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT THAT BE DONE ANNUALLY THIS WILL RESULT IN. BETTER OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY. BETTER LEGISLATIVE. VIEWPOINT AND WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE AT WITH ALL CONTRACTING PROCESS I BELIEVE IT'S WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE BILL TODAY THEM OKAY ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. THAT BILLS REMOVED SECOND IT. I THINK IS A FINE COMMONSENSE BILL MACHINE OBERNOLTE AND AND I WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO A QUESTION FROM IS QUIRK SILVA ALLEGING THAT THERE'S FRAUD OR ABUSE THERE BUT. WHAT THE AUDITOR IS SAYING IS THAT? I WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB AT MAKING SURE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THOSE EXEMPTIONS ARE AWARDED ARE APPROPRIATE. OTHERS ARE VERY LIMITED CATEGORY OF. CASES IN WHICH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY MAY MAY APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION WOULD FOR EXAMPLE OF MEN EMERGENCY CONTRACT TO BE LET YOU KNOW WHEN TIME IS CRITICAL. OF CONTRACTS FOR LEGAL SERVICES THINGS LIKE THAT BUT DOES THOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE NOT THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE APPROVED REGULARLY I THINK THAT WAS THE AUDITOR'S. THE AUDITOR'S FEAR AND. THAT'S WHAT THE AUDITOR OPINED THAT WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB OVERSEEING THAT AND. WAS FELT THAT IT ANNUAL REPORT TO JUST HIGHLIGHTED THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THOSE REQUESTS WERE BEING GRANTED WILL BE HELPFUL. A REAL QUICK COMMENT I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE AND I THINK IT'S NO DIFFERENT THE BUSINESS WORLD THAT WHEN. PEOPLE ARE WATCHING WE SENT PERFORMERS ARE BEST. AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS MEASURE BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES TO BE AT OUR BEST. IF YOU SECRETARY PLEASE CALL WHICH I TO CLOSE ON A MAP. PLEASE CULTURAL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REAR FOR TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS TH ELEMENT THAT'S EGGMAN BY SOME OF THIS EGGMAN AYE AYE PATTERSON. BURKE. SAID A MONTH THIS LACKEY. LACKEY AYE MEDINA MEDINA ICRC SELA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. THE BILL IS OUT LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OBERNOLTE TWO BILLS OUT TODAY. I SEE MR GARCIA SITTING HERE. ONE USERS. WELCOME. JERRY. COLLEAGUES REPRESENT YOU AB TWENTY ONE OH SIX. THE BILL THAT THAT WILL TAKE THE CURRENTLY EXISTING BIT PREFERENCE FROM FIVE TO TEN PERCENT PER STATE. SAYS RELATED TO CALIFORNIA GROWN. A CALIFORNIA PACKED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS OVER. THOSE PRODUCED AT A STATE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THE BILL. SECOND OKAY. ALRIGHT. OKAY WHAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN NO ALLOCATION OF THE FIVE PERCENT WHY IS THAT. BELIEVE THAT WE ALREADY NEED TEN PERCENT. SO DURING THE BREAK WE MET WITH A. NUMBER OF LOCAL FARMERS IN OUR DISTRICT IMPERIAL AND. RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH IS A VERY HIGH PRODUCTION. AREA FOR THE STATE AND IT BECAME. QUITE CLEAR THAT. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FIVE PERCENT. THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THAT EXISTS. WITH OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH AND PERHAPS EVEN STATES TO THE EASTERN ARIZONA BEING ONE OF THEM. pCOULD BE DONE TO ASSIST ODD THE AG INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. JUST YESTERDAY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE WRITTEN IN THE LOCAL PAPER THAT YOUR SON THAT TALKED ABOUT THE NEED. FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ELEVATE. YOU KNOW THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BUYING CALIFORNIA PRODUCE I'M HELPING YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY REALLY. MEAN ALL OF THE OTHER EXTERNAL FORCES THAT THAT MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT. FOR THEM AYE TO COMPETE. ONE EXAMPLE THOSE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. I JUST MET ARTICLE BUT SOME OF OUR LOCAL FARMERS IS OUR PROXIMITY TO THE MEXICAN BORDER. MAKES IT VERY VERY COMPETITIVE. FOR FARMERS IN IMPAIR COUNTY. TO DO BUSINESS. A RELATIVELY SPEAKING TO THOSE DOING BUSINESS. IN MEXICO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CAPITAL OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SO. ALTHOUGH OF FIVE PERCENT WAS A GOOD GOAL THAT THAT WAS A CHEAP LAST YEAR. IN OUR IMMEDIATE CONVERSATION SOON AFTER AT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE TEN PERCENT COULD PROBABLY BE. I THAT MUCH MORE HELPFUL. LONG ANSWER BUT THAT THAT'S. IT'S MY ERA. THANK YOU FEEDBACK. YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. NOTHING CHAIRWOMAN AT JIM HOUSTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AYE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE OF SIX AND JUST A POINT PERSONAL PRIVILEGE YEAH THIS EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO THAT I WAS A STAFF PERSON AND SOMEONE SALINAS IS OFFICE. WHEN WE FIRST RAN A CALIFORNIA GROOM BILL AND AND SO IT WAS VERY GRATIFYING TO SEE IT SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER. I FINALLY GET A SIGNED INTO LAW AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE HIGHEST STANDARDS HERE IN THE IN THE NATION IN THE WORLD FOR CA FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. AND I THINK ONE THING THAT GETS LOST IN THAT IS THAT WHEN A FARMER OR A PROCESSING PLANT HAS TO FILE THE PAPERWORK WITH THE VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES COUNTIES I'M AT SACRAMENTO. THAT'S MONEY THAT'S TAKEN OUT OF THAT CAN UNIT IS ECONOMY. ALRIGHT THAT'S TO MY THIS TAKEN OUT OF FRESNO OR A ROW SEE OR LINDSAY OR I'M IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THE IMPERIAL VALLEY AND GOES UP TO SACRAMENTO AND THERE MAY BE. I'M NO GOOD REASON FOR THAT BUT THAT'S MONEY THAT DOES NOT GO BACK INTO INVESTMENT THAT THAT'S NOT GO BACK INTO WAGES ETCETERA AND SO THAT CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A HISTORY OF SUPPORTING. SORT OF VALUE DRIVEN. PURCHASES INNER IN ENERGY FIELD FOR INSTANCE WOULD MANDATE THE PURCHASE OF ELECTRICAL FLEETS I'M IN OUR ENERGY PURCHASES. AND A AND A RATE PAYERS  <u><c.green>PAY PAY</c></u> HIGHER PORTION TEST TO MEET ENERGY GOALS WHICH WE SUPPORT. AND BUT AND WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT IN THE REALM OF OF CALIFORNIA ACT AND SO AND IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO FIVE PERCENT BUT MR GARCIA'S POINT. I'M YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARGINS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COST OF PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND I GET COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES FIVE PERCENT IS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET SAP. AND TEN PERCENT IS IS SIGNIFICANTLY WE REALLY APPRECIATE AYE THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS EFFORTS OF LEADERSHIP ON THIS THANK YOU. REAL SPEAKING SUPPORT TODAY. YOU MAY SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. AND THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. BUT. NICE TO SEE YOU MISTER HUSSEIN I'M A AND AND I I WAS LIKE YEAH I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE JUST DID FIVE AND AND NOW WE'RE DOING TEN AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE DO THINGS THAT ARE ASPIRATIONAL TO. I'D MISTER MISTER HOUSTON IS THIS. SWITCHING TO A DIFFERENT TEAM NOW SO HE KNOWS THAT THAT A SOMETIMES THE THE GOVERNOR MAY NOT SIGN A BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE CONTINUES TO BE CLEAR TO OUR FARMERS TO OUR AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY TO EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT THIS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR OUR OUR VALUES RESULT IN POLICIES THAT SOMETIMES DON'T PUT OUR OUR STATE ECONOMY AT THE BEST ADVANTAGE AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS WE VALUE. WE'VE AYE WORKERS RIGHTS WE VALUE THE ENVIRONMENT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO VALUE PUT VALUE ON THAT PRODUCE IT IS PRODUCED AT SOMETIMES A HIGHER COST THAN CAN BE ACHIEVED IN ARIZONA SAY. OR MEXICO SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER CHRISTIAN I WILL LE LET ME START BY SAYING I THINK YOU TO YOUR STAFF AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT IN MY OPENING THEY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THE ANALYSIS. MENTIONED DATA. YOU KNOW IT'S PUTTING OUR OUR. MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. BUT AND TERMS OF US STANDING BY. WHAT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT JOBS ECONOMIC ENGINE DRIVER FOR US HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO? THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR APPLE. THINK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE THEN A MONTH EGGMAN PIE TIME A MONTH AS A MAN I PATTERSON. BURKE. SAID A MONTH THIS. THAT A MONTH IF I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE MEDINA. MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. SILVA AYE. BILLS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. US I WOULD INTERCHANGEABLE SHOULDN'T. FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR. SECOND I'M BILL HAS BEEN THAT NOT AS IN MOTION AND SECOND OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FOR THE CONSENT.

SAID A MONTH THIS. SAID MONTH THIS AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE MEDINA MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. SILVA AYE. VERY MUCH. BIG BUDGET IS UP BUT THAT STEP THAT. THE. PROCEED. I THINK. WE AREA THERE ARE FIRE APPEAR TODAY. I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY THREE BUT AND THIS BILL COMES AS A RESULT OF IT AUDIT WE DID WE DIDN'T AUDIT LAST YEAR ON THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX SOMETHING THAT COULD LIKE HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST WORDS GOING ON WITH THIS. NO ONE IS THINGS THAT WE DISCOVERED WAS. COST ACOSTA PROJECTS CAN OVERRUN. AND SO AS I THINK WE'RE ENTERING A PERIOD OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ARE REALLY WORKING ON TRYING THING UP INFRASTRUCTURE HOW DO WE BUILD WHAT WE DO. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF AN AGENCY OF STATE AGENCY A BIT SOMETHING OVER HUNTER HAS A CONTRACT OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROJECT THEY'RE WORKING ON IF THAT RUNS OVER. THAT THAT AND THEN NEEDS TO BE POSTED ON THE WEBSITE SO THAT WE CAN ALL SEE IT RUN OVER AND BY HOW MUCH RUN OVER AND WHY IT'S RUN OVER. SO AGAIN AS WE AS MR LACKEY SAID WHEN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AS WE TEND TO BEHAVE BETTER SOMETIMES THESE THINGS HAPPEN PROJECTS RUN OVER WHAT WE THINK THEY'RE GONNA ABOUT GO OVER. BUT WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR INSTANCE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT. EVERYONE AGREES ON A PRICE TAG THAT GOES UP AND UP AND PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BUT WHY IS THAT HAPPENING. SO THIS WOULD TO SAY THEY WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO POST THAT IT'S GONE OVER HOW MUCH IT'S GOING OVER AND PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE TIMELINES. BUT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO LOCAL AGENCIES ANOTHER WITH SOME LATE OPPOSITION THAT CAME FROM SOME LOCAL AGENCIES DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM IT ONLY APPLIES TO STATE AGENCIES I'M PROJECTS GOING FORWARD. A.
