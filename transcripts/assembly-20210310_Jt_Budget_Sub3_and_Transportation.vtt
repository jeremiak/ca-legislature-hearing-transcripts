00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:35.393
SHAFTER SEGMENT. IS LESS THAN

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.965
THEY COLLECT READING A QUOTE. A

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:42.800
HORRIBLE SEQUENCE OF MISTAKES

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.335

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.870

REALITY. I AM REMINDED OF THE

00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:57.315

PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.319
PAST BEHAVIOR. I DON'T BELIEVE

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:03.021
WE CAN CONTINUE TO HOPE AND

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:03.988
WISH THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:06.357
TO BE OKAY. IF SOMETHING DOES

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.559
NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE. AND I

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.816
REFLECT THAT. I STARTED ON THIS

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.484
PROJECT TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:29.453
THAT'S THE FIRST COLUMN THERE.

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.054
OF HOW MANY CONSTRUCTION JOBS

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:31.955
WE HAD UNDER WAY HELP

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.057
INSTRUCTORS. WE HAD COMPLETED

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:35.292
OR HAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION WHERE

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.993
WE WERE ON ENVIRONMENTAL. AND

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.595
THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE MOST UP

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:39.963
TO DATE INFORMATION WE HAVE ON

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.665
THIS AT THIS POINT. AND THEN

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.899
YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE MADE

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.100
GREAT ADVANCEMENTS IN BOTH

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:46.102
JOBS. STRUCTURES COMPLETED OR

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:48.538
UNDERWAY WE'RE MOVING A MUCH

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:48.972
QUICKER PACE ON THE

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:54.277
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. RIGHT

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.881
AWAY PARCELS OF. NOT FOR

00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.283
MILLION. WORKERS FOUR HUNDRED.

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.218
WHICH WOULD START. IN YOU COULD

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:03.019
SEE GENERALLY BAD. ONE ELEMENT

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.822
OF SWIPE I THINK IS. TO POINT

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:06.890
TO. YES BACK WHILE WROTE DESIGN

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:10.293
COMPLETE. WHEN I GOT IN

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.528
DECEMBER EIGHT I WAS. WILL NEED

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.996
STEP HUNDRED FORTY. GO TO

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:13.897
CONSTRUCT. AND THAT WAS

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.966
INCORRECT WELL WE NEED TWENTY

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.133
TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THE

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.702
REASON THAT WAS INCORRECT OURS

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.170
BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS NOT

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:22.138
VERY FAR DESIGN FORTY SIX

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:24.674
PERCENT. AND TODAY IT'S 95%

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.710
DESIGN WHICH MEANS WE MAY HAVE

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:28.245
A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON EXACTLY

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.779
WHAT'S WORSE WHAT WE HAVE TO BE

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:31.948
A PLACE TO WORK. THAT'S IN PART

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:35.252
WHY WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.086
OUR ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:39.723
NEXT LOCKED. BOB THIS IS JUST A

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.291
QUICK UP INTEGRATION OF THINGS

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.059
THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE COMING UP

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:45.128
THAT ARE- MILESTONES WE WILL

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.831
HIT- I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.499
THESE BECAUSE OF TIME AGAIN

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.867
THESE ARE THINGS I'VE MENTIONED

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.836
EARLIER THAT'S OUR MILESTONES

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:56.106
THE PROGRAM WILL HIT THE NEXT

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:57.140
TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS. NEXT

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:00.277
ONE. THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

VERY SLOWLY FOR SOME TIME. BUT

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.183
IS NOW PICKING UP PACE. WE ARE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.319
REQUIRED TO MATCH ALL THE

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:10.587
FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE GIVEN ON

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.656

COMING UNDER CONTROL AND THAT

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:44.274
IS CONTRIBUTING TO GETTING THE

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.042
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.877
UNDER BETTER CONTROL. THAN WHY

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.813
WOULD ADD THAT THE EXISTING

AND MENTIONED WE BELIEVE THIS

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.612
WILL LIKELY TO GIVE REASONABLE

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.914
CONSIDERATION TO THE REQUEST TO

TWENTY TEN FUNDING. MORE

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:35.425
BROADLY THERE IS MORE REALISM

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.460
AND WHAT THE AUTHORITY SAYS IT

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:40.029
CAN AND CANNOT DO. THERE'S GOOD

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.865
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN

00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:43.066
COMPLETE WITH THE EXISTING

FAR FROM FULLY DETAILED.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.822
THERE'S A MYTHICAL POSSIBILITY

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.885
OVER THE TERMS OF PROPOSITION

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.020
ONE NAY CERTAINLY. THERE HAVE

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:45.922
BEEN LEGAL CHALLENGES AT EVERY

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:49.259
STEP IN THIS PROJECT. IN ANY

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:50.727
EVENT- IT IS CLEAR THAT THE

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.528
AUTHORITY WILL NEED TO ADDED

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:55.031
FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.566
IF IT IS TO GO BEYOND THE

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:59.369
MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD SECTION.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.738
WITH THIS IN MIND OUR REPORT

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:03.606
EMPHASIZES A NUMBER OF POINTS

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:06.109
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:09.178
TO CONSIDER FIRST. ASSUMING

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.980
THAT BY MID MINISTRATIONS

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.348
APPROVES A RELAXATION OF THE

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.617
EARLY DEADLINE THERE WILL NO

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:16.986
LONGER BE ANY MAJOR TIME

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:20.924
PRESSURES THERE IS TIME TO FILL.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.358
ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITY DOES

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:23.860
APPEAR TO BE INCREASING ITS

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.228
CONTROL OVER THE CONSTRUCTION

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:27.630
PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.098
BE MORE CONFIDENT IF THAT

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:31.601
CONTROL AS DEMONSTRATED OVER A

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:34.604
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. GOVERNOR

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.506
NEWSOM HAS DIRECTED THAT A

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.408
SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM TO COMBAT

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.076
CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:41.477
CHANGES TO THE STATE'S

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.713
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. MUST BE

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.482
DEVELOPED BY JULY FIFTEENTH

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.284
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REPORT

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.019
SHOULD CLARIFY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.721
VIEW OF THE WORLD OF HIGH SPEED

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:52.922
RAIL IN THE OVERALL STATE

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.224
SYSTEM AND HIS IDEAS FOR

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.960
FUNDING. THIS COULD BE AN

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:58.428
IMPORTANT BASIS FOR THE

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:01.331
LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. I

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.166
WANT TO ADD THAT THIS WELL THAT

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.635
THE PROPOSAL'S FOR FURTHER WORK

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.603
IMPLY AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.439
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:10.940
BUILD THE SYSTEM WILL CONTROL

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.109
EAGLE MONEY IS AVAILABLE IF

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.112
THAT AGREEMENT IS MINUS PLACE

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:16.980
THE- NUMBER OF. YOU CHOOSE A

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:20.450
PLAN SHOULD BE LEVERAGED. NEXT

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.452
THE EXISTING MEMORANDUM OF

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.853
UNDERSTANDING NEEDS TO BE

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.955
TRANSLATED INTO A DETAILED

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.790
AGREEMENT WITH FIRM MANAGEMENT

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.525
UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS FROM THE

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:32.328
STATE SEN MCCAIN JOINT COVERAGE

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.230
OF THIRTY AN ACE. THE ECONOMIC

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.232
VIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.634
OPERATION IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.670
ON THE ACTORS IN FUNDING THAT

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.905
ARE OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.640
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. I

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:47.610
SHOULD ADD HOWEVER THAT 75% OF

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.246
THE PROPOSED RIDERSHIP OF THIS

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.582
INTERIM SYSTEM IS NOT HI SPEED

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.250
BRIDGES ON THE LINK BETWEEN

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.185
SACRAMENTO AND STOCKTON AND

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.488
WILL BE A SYSTEM. SO IT IS

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.490
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.758
SURE THAT THAT PART OF THE

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:05.561
SYSTEM IS INVESTED AND OPERATED

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.130
EXACTLY THE WAY IT SHOULD.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.332
OVERRIDING ALL OF THIS IS THE

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.367
SIMPLE FACT THAT EXISTING

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.536
FUNDING SOURCES MAY WELL NOT BE

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.471
ADEQUATE EVEN THIS INITIALLY

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:16.706
ADDED LINKS IN THE INNER

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.641
PROPOSAL. AND THEY WILL

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:21.010
CERTAINLY NOT PERMIT ADDING

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.979
LINKS OUTSIDE. SAID IT

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.615
BAKERSFIELD DO FEDERAL FUNDING

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.683
AND RECONSIDERATION OF ERA AND

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.719
THE FISCAL TWENTY TEN MONEY IS

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.654
A POSSIBILITY THAT MAY EMERGE

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.624
MORE CLEARLY SIX MONTHS OR SO

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.726
AND IT'S REASONABLE TO DEFER

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.560
SCOPE IN STATE FUNDING

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.862
DECISIONS UNTIL WE KNOW THE

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:42.065
ANSWERS. BASED ON PAST FEDERAL

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.833
PROGRAMS INSTRUCTOR THOUGH

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.668
FEDERAL MONEY ALONE THEY WILL

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.470
NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.906
ANYWAY SO ADDED STATE FUNDING

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.742
IS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THE

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.644
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.446
IN ANY CASE I WANT TO STRESS A

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.414
POINT WE HAVE MADE BEFORE THAT

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.249
MEANING OF THE PAST MANAGEMENT

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.818
PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.953
FUNDING ISSUES AND IT WILL

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.155
NEVER BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.457
TO MANAGE THE PROJECT

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:10.960
EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT ADEQUATE

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.695
AND STABLE FUNDING. WHILE THESE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.530
ISSUES ARE BEING RESOLVED WE

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:15.898
BELIEVE THE AUTHORITY SHOULD

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.000
DEFER MAKING BINDING CONTRACT

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.136
COMMITMENTS FELT SLIGHT ISSUE

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.572
YES REQUIRED. THE WAY VANCE

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.340
ENGINEERING IN THE LAND SONOMA

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.209
MAJOR CIVIL WORKS OUTSIDE THE

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:30.847
CVS. OF COURSE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. GIVEN THE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.181
IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT WE

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.117
BELIEVE THAT WE SAID BEFORE

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.486
THAT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT BY THE

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.221
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A GOOD

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.990
IDEA. THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:43.726
SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.428
NEW WOULD BE NEEDED TO OVERSEE

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.296
THE PROJECT PROGRESS OVER

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:50.233
APPEARING IN YEARS NOT JUST ONE

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.869
BUDGET CYCLE. THANKS FOR YOUR

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:56.205
ATTENTION. I ALWAYS. ENJOY

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.740
HEARING BEFORE YOU AND I WOULD

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.509
BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:02.378
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. TO

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:02.879
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.582
THOMPSON OUR FINAL- UP- SPEAK

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.784
ON THIS PANEL IS HELEN WITH THE

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:12.755
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.190
GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS MY

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.091
NAME IS HELEN CRISTINA THE

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.392
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:17.894
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.661
ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.029
MORNING'S HEARING I WANT TO

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.864
FOCUS MY BRIEF REMARKS ON A KEY

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.065
DECISION FACING THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.367
WHICH IS HOW TO APPROACH AN

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:25.601
UPCOMING REQUEST FOR THE

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.770
APPROPRIATION OF ALMOST ALL OF

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:28.404
THE REMAINING PROPOSITION ONE A

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.573
FUN. THIS UPCOMING OPERATION

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.341
REQUEST PRESENTS AND NATURAL

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.876
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:34.777
TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.112
DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT AND

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.547
ENSURE THAT IT OUTLINES WITH

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.849
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. WE KNOW

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:40.750
WHETHER SUCH NATURAL

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.084
OPPORTUNITY MAY NOT EMERGE FOR

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.853
SEVERAL YEARS. FROM OUR

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.655
PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TWO KEY

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.322
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:47.790
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THAT

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.192
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:51.794
APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST. FIRST

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.461
BUT I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.663
CONSIDER ITS LEVEL OF

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.097
CONFIDENCE THAT IT WILL FUNDING

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.099
BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THAT

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.267
WERE SENT TO BAKERSFIELD

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.102
SEGMENT. SO I WAS MENTIONED

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.137
PREVIOUSLY THE AUTHORITY

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.572
EXPECTED EXISTING FUNDING WILL

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.839
BE ROUGHLY SUFFICIENT TO

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:05.374
COMPLETE THE REVISED SCOPE OF

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:06.809
PERCENT TO BAKERSFIELD AND THIS

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.978
IS A SINGLE TRACK WITH PRETTY

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.479
BASIC STATION PLATFORMS.

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.114
HOWEVER HISTORICALLY PROJECT

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.583
COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.450
WE THINK THAT THERE'S

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.718
DEFINITELY RISK THAT THIS WILL

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.253
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN OR THAT

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.421
SOMEBODY EXPECTED FUNDING MIGHT

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.122
NOT MATERIALIZE SO THIS MEANS

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.557
THAT EXISTING FUNDING MIGHT NOT

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.792
BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPETE EVEN

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:28.931
NEVER. SENT TO BAKERSFIELD

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:29.365
SEGMENT. SECOND THE

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.066
LEGISLATURE- WANT TO CONVEY

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.033
COMMITTEE TO FULL FUNDING

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.868
PROJECT. IS ITS LEVEL OF. TO

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.070
MEETING A FUNDING GAP IF ANY

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.372
THAT COULD. YOU CAN. THEM TODAY.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.440
THANK MY- AS WELL AS ITS

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.541
COMMITMENT TO FUNDING. SECOND

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.642
SUCH AS THE BALLOT ABOUT LINE

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.444
AND PHASE ONE. WHICH CERTAINLY

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.279
REFER NEW THING SOURCES. IF THE

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:44.413
LEGISLATURE COMMITTED TO. WERE

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.848
SET TO BAKER. EVA IF THE

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.283
FUNDING EMERGED AND IS ALSO

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.551
COMMITTED TO FINDING FUTURE

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.919
PROJECT SEGMENTS AND WE THINK

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.187
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.289
PROPOSED APPROACH. SEEMS PRETTY

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.758
REASONABLE- IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.493
TO REFINANCE AT THIS EXPECTED

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.394
TO BE REQUESTED BY THE

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.429
AUTHORITY. HOWEVER IF THE

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:01.430
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T WANT TO

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.331
MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FINDING

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.899
RESENTED BAKERSFIELD AND FUTURE

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.401
SEGMENTS AT THIS TIME WE

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.569
SUGGEST IT MAY WANT TO TAKE

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.204
ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WOULD

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.706
PROVIDE- MORE FLEXIBILITY AND

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.508
ALSO. MAXIMIZE STANDALONE VALUE

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.377
OF WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.778
COMPLETED. SO IN THIS CASE

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:16.812
THERE ARE TWO MAIN OPTIONS

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.948
FIRST ALLEGED YOUR IF ITHAD A

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:20.383
SPECIFIC APPROACH IN MIND THAT

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.684
WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. FOR

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.852
EXAMPLE KNOWING THE PROJECT

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:23.986
SCOPE TO WHAT'S REQUIRED BY THE

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.321
FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT AND

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.222
THAT WOULD BE TOO BIG REALLY

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.123
CONSTRUCTION OF A USABLE

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.091
SEGMENTS- AND THAT ONE NINETEEN

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:29.825
MILES NOT NECESSARILY

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.727
ELECTRIFICATION. IT COULD NOT

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.362
STATUTORY LANGUAGE DIRECTING

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.764
THE AUTHORITY ACCORDINGLY.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.299
SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.333
DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.067
APPROACH THAT WOULD LIKE TO

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.635
COMMITTEE NOW IT COULD TAKE

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:46.175
ACTIONS. TO PRESERVE ITS

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.176
ACCESSIBILITY. WOULD LIKELY

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:49.111
DELAY ACTION ON. OR ALL OF THE

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.680
PROPOSED APPROPRIATION REQUEST.

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:51.547
I'M IN THIS WOULD PRESERVE

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.149
NATURALLY. MAKING POINT PEOPLE.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:53.716
WE THINK IT WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:54.383
INCLUDE ADOPTING STATUS

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.485
LANGUAGE. THE F. FROM ENTERING

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.253
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD COMMIT THE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.754
STATE TO APPROACH SUCH AS

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.456
ELECTRIFICATION. SO THAT FOR

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:01.791
EXAMPLE THAT CATEGORY LIKE

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:02.491
WHICH COULD PREVENT THE

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:03.926
AUTHORITY FROM THE SAME LETTER

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.362
BY TRAINS. AT THIS TIME OR AND

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:07.530
COMMITTING THE STATE'S YOU.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:08.931
CONSTRUCTING WATER BY CAPTAIN

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:13.235
SYSTEMS. ARE ALSO HAPPY TO TAKE

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.704
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU A MISS

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.638
CHRISTINE I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:16.739
MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAME

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.442
EARLIER- THAT BRINGS US TO THE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:24.313
CONCLUSION OF- OF- THIS. HANDLE

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.717
AND I AM GOING TO- A PASS ON

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:30.186
ASKING- AND INITIAL QUESTION

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:32.788
AND ASK MISS BRIDGEMAN IF SHE

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:33.823
WOULD LIKE TO COMMENCE OF

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.991
CLASSES AND TO MEMBERS PLEASE

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.893
JUST TO INDICATE IF YOU HAVE A

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.729
QUESTION I'LL TRY TO. KEEP AN

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.431
EYE ON IT. INCLUDE EVERYONE I

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.599
JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE GOING TO

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.134
ASK ONE QUESTION AND THEN PASS

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:47.203
IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:49.238
COMMITTEE CORRECTED I ASK YOU

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:50.539
TO MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AS

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.575
CONCISE AS POSSIBLE AND-

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:57.346
PANELISTS- KEEP YOUR- RESPONSES

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.181
AS- CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. I HATE

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:00.182
MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR MR

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.084
KELLY I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:06.422
HIS PRESENTATION- SO. AT IT

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.590
SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S TWO

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.325
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT AS

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:12.294
TO- COMPLETING THIS PROJECT AND

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.463
THEN DEMONSTRATING THAT IT

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.333
SHOULD BE- CONTINUED THROUGH TO

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.201
LOS ANGELES AND BAY AREA SAN

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:22.505
DIEGO- ONE IDEA IS THAT THIS

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.840
SECTION- EITHER CONFIGURATION

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.008
OF SECTION WILL GENERATE SO

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.676
MUCH RIDERSHIP THAT THE PEOPLE

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:30.479
OF CALIFORNIA WILL. WILL DEMAND

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.014
THAT THEY NOW HAVE ACCESS TO

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.749
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE OTHER

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.885
THOUGHT IS THAT ONCE THEY SEE A

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:36.652
FAST TRAIN RUNNING IT

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.654
UNDERSTAND IT CAN BE BUILT.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.256
THEN THAT WOULD KIND OF DO THE

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.458
SAME THING SO MY QUESTION IS

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:48.164
WHY YOU BELIEVE. THAT. THIS

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.131
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILE

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:50.599
SECTION WOULD HAVE ENOUGH

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.369
RIDERSHIP. TO DEMONSTRATE THE

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.937
VIABILITY OF THIS PROJECT I

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.539
MEAN CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:57.673
HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN BE BUILT

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.974
THIS IS NOT NEW TECHNOLOGY THIS

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.376
IS FORTY AT LEAST FORTY YEAR

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.544
OLD TECHNOLOGY THAT WE SEE USED

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.711
AROUND THE WORLD SO IT'S NOT

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.914
THAT IT'S A NEW THING THAT. IS

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.048
GONNA BLOW PEOPLE'S MINDS RIGHT

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:08.117
SO WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:09.618
SINGLE TRACK SYSTEM THROUGH

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.587
THESE AREAS IS GOING TO HAVE SO

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:16.759
MUCH RIDERSHIP. THAT. IT WILL

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.861
CONVINCE US TO FUND THE REST.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.863
AS OPPOSED. OTHER INVESTMENTS

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.298
THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK REYES

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:26.335
RIDERSHIP. WHY DON'T I GUESS

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.170
I'M PERSON I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:28.771
WHAT THOSE ARE BUT LET ME JUST

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.973
SAY. THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.477
TAKING IS NOT IT IS REALLY. IN

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.345
MY VIEW A PRAGMATIC APPROACH

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:37.880
BASED ON WHERE WE ARE ON THE

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.849
PROJECT AT THIS TIME. AND THE

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:43.519
AMOUNT OF. RESOURCES WE HAVE.

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.321
TO BRING IT FORWARD TO DEVELOP

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.456
SOMETHING THAT IS OF VALUE. AND

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:50.759
USABLE AND CAN DEMONSTRATE WHAT

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:51.961
ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.096
DO. WHICH I DON'T THINK WHICH I

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.264
KNOW IS AVAILABLE AROUND THE

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.699
WORLD BUT IS NOT AVAILABLE

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.168
ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. AND IS NOT

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.402
SOMETHING CALIFORNIANS CAN

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.505
EXPERIENCE HERE AT HOME. AND SO

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.707
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE SAID

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:07.910
LOOK. AT THIS MONEY TO BUILD A

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.180
HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH INTHE VALLEY. THE NORTHERN AND

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.214
SOUTHERN TERMINATION

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.483
TERMINATION POINT OF THAT ARE

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:17.152
NOT AN IDEAL OPERATING RUN. IF

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.153
WE EXTEND FURTHER INTO THE

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.055
CITIES AND THE WAY WE GET TO AN

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:23.392
OPERATING RUN. THAT BOTH ARE

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.995
ADVISORS BURKE WHO RUN HIGH

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:28.898
SPEED RAIL. TODAY AND A PEER

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.834
REVIEW GROUP HAVE CONFIRMED- A

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.435
REASONABLE ASSUMPTION IS IT

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.604
WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED RIDERSHIP

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.039
MORE THAN DOUBLING. THE

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.774
RIDERSHIP IN THE VALLEY ON

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.676
TODAY'S SERVICE VERSUS A NO

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.578
BUILD OPTION JUST LEAVING

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:45.080
TODAY'SDIESEL SERVICE THAT

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:47.349
SHARES FREIGHT TRAFFIC. WE WANT

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.184
TO USE THE ASSETS THAT WE NOW

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.253
HAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. TO

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.222
PROVIDE A VALUABLE INTERIM

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.524
SERVICE WHILE WE COMPLETE THE

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.126
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ACROSS THE

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:59.261
STATE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.764
IN ANAHEIM- IN ADVANCE THOSE

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.766
SEGMENTS. TOWARD CONSTRUCTION

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:07.736
WHEN MONEY BECOMES AVAILABLE.

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:10.940
SO FOR US. PUZZLE IS. A MORE.

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.541
EARLY PRAGMATIC WAY SAY HERE'S

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.543
THE BUDGET WE KNOW WE HAVE WHAT

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.412
WE THINK WE CAN DO WITH THAT IS

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.180
IT A VALUE TO CALIFORNIANS A

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.982
PARTICULARLY A PLACE LIKE THE

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.951
CENTRAL VALLEY DOES NOT HAVE A

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:23.886
TON OF TRANSIT OPTIONS AND IS

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.956
IN A GOOD PLACE TO START-DEMONSTRATING WHAT THIS CAN DO

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.591
AS WE EXPAND OUT OF THE BALLOT

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.992
AND LOOK WE STARTED IN THE

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.994
VALLEY WE'RE INVESTING BILLIONS

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.896
IN THE VALLEY. AND TO GET THAT

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.531
WORK DONE AND MAKE SOMETHING OF

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:38.000
VALUE IN OPERATIONAL THERE BUT

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:38.968
WE THINK WE NEED TO EXTEND INTO

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.136
THE CITIES OF THE VALLEY AND BY

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.605
DOING THAT WE CAN GET

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:45.874
OPERATIONS RUN GOING AND THEN

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:51.480
WE CONSIDERED HOW TO EXPAND.

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.015
THANK YOU OF MR PATTERSON IS

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.984
NEXT UP FOLLOWED BY MISS NGUYEN

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:58.087
WHO IS SUCH A- GOING TO BE-

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:03.726
REMOTE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.195
ABOUT DOES SOMETHING OF VALUE-

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.630
LET ME JUST SAY THAT CENTRAL

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:08.897
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN THE GUINEA

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.000
PIG IN. ALL OF THIS. THAT I'VE

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.868
BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARS AND HAVE

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.703
SEEN REPEATED BUSINESS PLANS.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.005
AND THEY ALL HAVE ONE THING IN

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.173
COMMON THEY COST MUCH MUCH MORE

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.111
AND BUILD. MUCH MUCH LESS.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.179
FRESNO IN PARTICULAR IS WE'RE

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.914
GETTING RIPPED UP OUR LANDSCAPE

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:28.017
OUR FARMLAND OR CITYSCAPES

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.051
THERE'S ACCESS PROPERTY TURNING

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.154
IN. THE BLIGHT WE HAVE BEEN

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.289
PROMISED SOMETHING OF VALUE.

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.658
YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.960
DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN THE PLAN

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:41.463
CAME FORWARD. THAT IT WOULD

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:44.433
HAVE A ONE TRACK. ON PAGE SIXTY

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.969
pNINE ON PAGE SEVENTY ON PAGE

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:47.636
NINETY ONE THE AUTHORITY

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.472
EMPHASIZES AND RE EMPHASIZES

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.975
THIS SINGLE TRACK APPROACH.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.176
WHEN WE LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.577
EYES OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WE

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:59.148
SEE. THAT THIS WILL BE A ONE

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:04.319
TRACK. EMPTY TRAINS NO STATIONS

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.255
AND I GUESS NO PASSENGERS IN IN

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:09.091
TEST MODE. OR MAYBE FIVE YEARS

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:13.395
OR PERHAPS. LONGER AND SO OUR

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.298
DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT WE HAVE.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.200
BANTUS ABATING AND HAVE MADE A

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.303
LOT OF LOCAL COMMITMENTS AND

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.338
YET WE'RE STILL RIPPED UP AND

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:26.475
WE NOW EXPECT A SINGLE TRACK-

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:29.945
THAT- I THINK CAN HAVE A HARD

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.614
TIME DEMONSTRATING THEIR VALUE

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.450
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU CAN. GET

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.051
THAT MIGHT GET TO THE QUESTION.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:40.489
SO CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:44.860
POSSIBLE VALUE. IN CENTRAL

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:47.463
CALIFORNIA FOR A- FOR A SINGLE

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.767
TRACK. NO PASSENGERS. NO

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:57.940
STATIONS. AB WHY CAN'T CENTRAL

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:58.440
CALIFORNIA SEE THIS AS A

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:01.110
BETRAYAL. AND SEE IT AS NOT

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:05.047
ONLY JUST. RIPPING US UP BUT

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:10.652
RIPPING US OFF. WELL I GUESS MY

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.387
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WOULD

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.757
BE THAT- WE CLEARLY DON'T SEE

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:17.359
IT THE SAME WAY AND AUG THE

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.094
OPTION ON THE SINGLE TRACK

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.497
VERSUS THE DOUBLE TRACK ONE-

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.932
WILL STILL HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.701
MORE PASSENGERS THAN THE-

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.169
CURRENT NO BUILD OPTION AND

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.304
JUST LEAVING TODAY'S DIESEL

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.507
POWERED PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.075
IN THE BALLOT. BUT LIKE TO

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.910
FIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL ON ONE OR

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:37.679
TWO TRACKS WILL STILL HAVE THE

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.681
OPERATIONAL BENEFITS AND MEET

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:42.618
THE OPERATIONAL- THE

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.453
OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS AND

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.588
OBJECTIVES THAT WE SET ABOUT

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:48.190
THE DOUBLE TRACK THE ISSUE IS

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.826
NOT DO WE EVER DO THE DOUBLE

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:51.894
TRACK IT'S WHEN DO WE- AND-

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.529
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS AS

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.832
A WAY TO. CONSIDER DOING THIS

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.100
IN A MORE METHODICAL APPROACH

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.835
AND STAY WITHIN BUDGET.

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:03.205
LIMITATIONS THAT WE CAN DO THIS

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.039
ONE TRACK AT A TIME WITHOUT

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.874
SACRIFICING OPERATIONAL

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.709
BENEFITS. AND THAT IS WHAT WE

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.244
ARE PROPOSING. OUR BUSINESS

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.980
PLAN CONTAINS ROUGHLY TWO

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.248
HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:15.150
INVEST IN STATIONS AND THE

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.652
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE PART.

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.520
OF BUILDING THE BAKERSFIELD

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.923
MERCED STRETCH FOUR STATIONS IN

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.125
PARTICULAR THAT UP WILL MOST

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.760
CERTAINLY. BE DEVELOPED IN A

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:25.861
WAY TO MAKE SURE PASSENGERS

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:28.030
GIVE ACCESS AND GET ON AND OFF

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.331
THE TRAIN SAFELY AND WILL

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.432
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.267
COMMUNITIES ON HOW TO DEVELOP.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.069
AROUND THE STAGE AND THAT'S

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.971
WORK WE HAVE UNDERWAY WILL

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.306
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.141
COMMUNITIES OF THE BALLOT ON.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.911
SO FOR US IT'S MORE LIKE. THERE

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.680
ARE THINGS WE WANT TO CONSIDER

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:46.048
WE WANT THE BIDDERS THE

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.783
TRACKING SYSTEMS THINGS OUT TO

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.385
BID. TODAY LIKE THE BIDDERS TO

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.920
PROPOSE IT AS A COUPLE OF

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.689
OPTIONS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.591
IF YOU DO ONE TRACK FIRST AND

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.392
THE SECOND TRACK. LATER WHAT

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.794
DOES IT LOOK LIKE IF YOU DO

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:00.929
ONLY TWO TRACKS. UP AND WHAT

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.164
DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOU COULD DO

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:05.934
ONE TRACK AND SO. ARE OUR BEST

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:09.037
ESTIMATE ON THIS IS THAT- THE

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:12.474
OPERATIONAL BENEFITS. ARE-

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:13.809
PERSONALLY THE SAME. OR THE

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.777
INTERIM SERVICE MEMBERS SAID TO

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.512
BAKERSFIELD ONE TRACKER TO IT

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:21.016
DOES INCLUDE. PASSING AREAS AT-

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.684
MAINTENANCE FACILITIES AND AT

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.753
STATIONS- WHETHER BE A SECOND

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.988
TRACK AND THERE'S ALSO AN

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.556
OPTION TO BUILD. ADDITIONAL

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.191
SITES BUT WE'D LIKE TO BE

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.959
INFORMED BY THE BIDS TO FIGURE

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.828
OUT HOW BEST TO PROCEED. BUT

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:34.396
THE IDEA AS A WAY TO GET THE

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:36.431
OPERATING SEGMENT IN PLACE.

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.634
BRINGING DELIVERY AND VALUE TO

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.035
THE RIDERS CENTRAL VALLEY

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:41.637
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SAID.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:46.141
IN THE EARLIER APPROACH. THANK

IF WE ARE STARTING. UN SO THE

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.228
ACTUALLY THE PLAN SET BEFORE US

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.596
IS TO BILL FOR MORE STEP TO

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:10.065
BAKERSFIELD SINGLE TRACK WHICH

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:10.699
WILL COST TWENTY TWO POINT TWO

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.634
BILLION DOLLARS. YET THE HIGH

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.903
SPEED RAILS ESTIMATE REVENUE IS

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:15.604
TWENTY ONE POINT THREE BILLION

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.639
DOLLARS LEAVING A BILLION

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:18.907
DOLLAR DEFICIT FOR THE PROJECT

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.909
AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS JUST

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:24.112
WITHIN THAT TRACK. NOW QUESTION

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:27.215

THE HOLE JUST FOR THIS PART. DO

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.587
YOU SEE IT BEING TOO RISKY FOR

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:35.223
THE LET'S SAY TO THAT THE STORY

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.726
MOVE FORWARD ON A PLAN THAT.

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.561
WE'RE IN A DEFICIT ALREADY.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.830
GIVEN THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:46.234
FINISH THE HIGH SEED RAIL IN.

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:46.868
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.003
ONE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN. TALKING

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.505
ABOUT. A PORTION OF STUDY IN

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.074
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHERE I

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:55.177
REPRESENT. AT ALL WE'RE STILL.

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.446

YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO DID YOU

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:12.494
ALREADY HAVE BEEN. MADE AS WELL

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:16.131
AS A RANGE OF. I THINK I MEAN

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:21.136
TO BE INVOLVED WELL AND SO IT

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:24.840
TURNS OUT THAT. ABOUT BUT IF

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.109
YOU THOSE POINTS BECAUSE MY

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:32.180
CHILDREN. TO M. NOT BE

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.916
SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND THE

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:35.550
CERTIFICATE COULD YOU ON FOR A

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:36.718
SECOND WE'RE NOT. AN ACTIVITY

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:40.822
YEAH. I DON'T. AND RICHARD TO

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:43.258
CAN SLOW DOWN SURE GEN WHERE IT

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.426
WOULD GOT A REQUEST THE YOU

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.027
SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:45.961
NOT HAVE TO ASK TO START OVER

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:51.099
WHEN WE'RE READY. WELL IF YOU

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.868
COULD TURN YOUR- HELPFUL WITH

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:55.337
THE THAT'LL AND FOR YOUR AUTO.

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:56.972
LET'S GIVE THAT A TRY THANK YOU

01:17:57.039 --> 01:18:00.776
ABOUT THAT. EACH SO- SO

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:02.244
ESSENTIALLY IT'S ALREADY PRE

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.212
BOTH RAIN FOR THE COST AS WELL

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.914
AS THE FUNDING AS WELL AS POINT

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.115
ESTIMATES MAKING WHAT YOU'RE

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.517
REFERRING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.951
THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.553
POINT ESTIMATES IT APPEARS

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.821
THERE'S A FUNDING GAP- THERE'S

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:13.655
CERTAINLY SOME UNCERTAINTY

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.023
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDING

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.591
WILL BE- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.859
WHAT FOR EXAMPLE CAP AND TRADE

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.294
WILL BRING AND THERE'S ALSO

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.729
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:21.830
THE COSTS ARE GOING TO LOOK

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:22.998
LIKE PARTICULARLY WITH THOSE

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:23.965
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:25.934
EXTENSION. ON THEIR END EARLY

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:27.502
DESIGN PHASES AND SO THERE'S

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:28.670
QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:29.604
ABOUT EXACTLY THOSE COSTS WILL

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.773
BE BUT I THINK AS YOU NOTED-

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.076
EVEN WITH THEIR ESTIMATES- IT'S

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:34.676
UNCLEAR IF THERE'S SUFFICIENT

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:36.478
FUNDING AT THIS POINT IN TERMS

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.447
OF THAT THE QUESTION OF RISK IT

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:39.781
REALLY IS I THINK FOR THE

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.083
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HOW

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.818
RISK AVERSE LEGISLATURE IS

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.620
RIGHT ACCURATE MORE RISK AVERSE

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.355
MANDATE YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:50.025
ONE- YOU KNOW. FIRST CONNECTS

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.726
WITH SMALLER SCOPE FOR EXAMPLE

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.361
SO MAYBE WE CAN GET TO DURING

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:55.363
THE FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.165
REQUIREMENT- FOR A GRANT

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.000
AGREEMENT AND THAT'S JUST THAT

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.236
INITIAL ONE NINETEEN MILES NOT

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.505
ELECTRIFIED YOU CAN DO THAT TO

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.440
SEE WHERE THAT GOES ON YOU CAN

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.008
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.176
AND MAKE SURE ALL THE CONTACTS

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.412
REALLY JUST JUST KIND OF COMING

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:11.913
INTO THAT I'M SORRY YOUR

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.714
GOVERNMENT HERE MORE RISK

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:13.648
AVERSE THAT MIGHT BE THE

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.616
APPROACH THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.052
TAKE. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.286
TAKE ON MORE RISK THAT YOU'RE

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.354
NOT GONNA HAVE TO BE SHOULD

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.189
FUNDING- AND THAT AND THAT

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.491
EDUCATIONAL FUNDING WILL NEED

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:23.925
TO BE IDENTIFIED EVEN TO

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.494
COMPLETE RESPECTIVE BAKERSFIELD

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.695
AND CERTAINLY TO COMPLETE

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:28.630
ADDITIONAL WORK BEYOND

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:31.900
PERSPECTIVE BAKERSFIELD IF YOU

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:32.501
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TOLERATE

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.302
MORE ABOUT RISK- COURT ABOUT

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.905
RISK- YOU TAKE THAT THE THIS

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:37.839
PARTIES YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.207
MORE ABOUT RIGHT THANK YOU

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.942
MIGHT BE MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:41.543
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.612
APPROACHED. I THINK IT REALLY

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.147
DEPENDS ON ON THAT RISK

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.848
TOLERANCE AND BECAUSE THE

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.084
LEGISLATURE HAD AGAIN TO FULLY

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.986
FUNDING THAT PROJECT BECAUSE I

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:51.620
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:54.389
WOULD BE PERHAPS PROBLEMATIC IT

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.625
TO END UP WITH JUST ONE HUNDRED

01:19:56.691 --> 01:20:05.233
NINETY MILES. BETTER

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.801
ELECTRIFIED AND NO DESIRE SPEND

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:07.802
A DAY. MONEY BECAUSE- THAT KIND

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:08.670
OF SMALL. A PROBLEM DOESN'T

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.505
MAKE SENSE. TO RUN. ELECTRIFIED

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:11.706
TRAINS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT MILES.

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.642
SHALL MEDINA. RIGHT AND SO. YOU

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.544
IF YOU'RE GONNA. NOT GONNA WANT

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.479
TO A- SAID. BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.113
GOING TO MAKE THAT YOU. TO SAY

HERE IS ABOUT 45% DESIGN. IT'S

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.835
HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.437
YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT RIGHT

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.706
AWAY YOU NEED YEAH. EXACTLY

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.708
WHERE IT'S GONNA GO IF YOU'RE

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.076
ONLY THAT PART DESIGNED TO DATE

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:30.111
WHERE 95% WILL BE A 100%

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.980
DESIGNED BY APRIL. AND THAT

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.115
MEANS NOW WE HAVE A HANDLE ON

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.483
EXACTLY WHAT RIGHT AWAY WE DO

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.985
NEED. AND WE'RE DANCING THE

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:38.987
BALL WE HAVE ABOUT 80% OF IT IN

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:41.623
HAND. AND WE WILL MOVE FORWARD

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.890
LET'S GET THE REST OF IT IN THE

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:47.762
NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OR SO-

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:49.530
IT'S SO. JANE ORDERS ARE NOW OF.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.132
SORT OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:52.367
THAT WERE LEFT UNANSWERED WHEN

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:53.735
THE PROJECT WAS NOT FULLY

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.236
DESIGN AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:57.005
THE FULL DESIGN AND YOU HAVE TO

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:59.173
EXECUTE CHANGE ORDERS TO FINISH

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.975
THAT WORK AND SO THAT'S GOING

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.477
TO BE WITH US THROUGH THIS

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.645
HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.279
HOWEVER OUR BUDGET ESTIMATES

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.448
ACCOUNT FOR THAT. IN OUR BUDGET

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.016
ESTIMATE NOW THAT IS FULLY

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:10.785
DESIGN- WE UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.053
THOSE RISKS ARE AND WHAT THAT'S

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.121
GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.856
WE ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD TO

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:17.225
WHICH- END UP ALL OF THESE

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:19.360
THINGS YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:21.929
GENERALLY CLAIM TOO MUCH AND WE

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.031
COME IN WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:24.832
AND OFTEN THESE THINGS GET THE

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:27.268
BILL SHE ADDED. AND- YEAH

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.337
NOBODY'S PARTICULARLY HAPPY BUT

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:31.072
WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT TO GET

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.840
THIS WORK DONE AND I THINK MOST

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.742
IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE AS AN

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.010
ORGANIZATION HAVE TO DO IS

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:37.412
UNDERSTAND THE LESSONS LEARNED

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.147
FROM THAT BAD START. A LOT OF

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.448
THINGS DIDN'T GO AS IT SHOULD

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:43.084
HAVE AND AS WE GO FORWARD FOR

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:43.651
HOW WE WILL DO CONSTRUCTION

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:45.687
CONTRACTS. GOING FORWARD WE

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:47.822
WILL BE IMPLEMENTING OUTLINED

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.323
THIS IN CHAPTER SIX OF OUR

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:52.093
BUSINESS PLAN A VERY METHODICAL

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.261
AND DISCIPLINED STAGE GATE

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:55.363
PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T DO

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.031
CONTRACTS OUT OF SEQUENCE WE DO

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.200
THEM IN SEQUENCE AT THE I THINK

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:03.071
THAT'LL HELP US AVOID. A

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.939
PROBLEM. THANK YOU MS THREE.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:08.342
FOLLOWED BY. THE SMITH. AND MR

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:13.614
FONG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.484
THAT ARE OF YES THANK YOU- FOR

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:19.053
THE PRESENTATIONS ON THIS TOPIC

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:19.787
I KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.956
VERY ENGAGED IN HIGH SPEED

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.726
RAIL- AND YOU KNOW I REMAIN

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:27.361
CONCERNED THAT IT MAY BE

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:29.230
PREMATURE TO BE HAVING A

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.666
DISCUSSION ABOUT ALLOCATING THE

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.101
REMAINING BOND FUNDS RIGHT NOW

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.235
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:36.537
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LEVEL OF

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:39.240
FUNDING OR FEDERAL MATCHES THAT

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.375
WE CAN EXPECT FROM WASHINGTON

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:43.811
TODAY- I HOPE THAT THOSE

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.346
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.615
GOVERNMENT DO PROGRESS- AND

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.984
GIVE US A BETTER SENSE. OF HOW

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.886
MUCH THEY'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:55.857
THIS PROJECT- BUT YOU KNOW I

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:58.726
WORRY THAT INSUFFICIENT FUNDING

01:29:58.793 --> 01:29:59.160
COULD LEAVE US WITH

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.529
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.531
ACCOMPLISH THE VISION OF HIGH

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:07.168
SPEED RAIL AND DOESN'T BENEFIT

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:11.105
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND SO

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.174
THAT'S THAT I AM STILL

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.275
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND I

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.443
THINK WE NEED FURTHER

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:19.747
DISCUSSION ON THAT- IN WITH

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.215
THOSE CONCERNS I THINK ARE

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:24.018
THERE ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW FOR

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:28.489
FROM THE CURRENT PLAN OF- AS

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:30.191
YOUR- MEMBER NUMBER SAID TO

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:33.761
BAKERSFIELD LINE AND I KNOW. OF

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.296
YEARS A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:38.332
BUDGETS OF THREE I REQUESTED- A

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:41.002
STUDY OF POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.771
TO THAT- PLAN AND I JUST WANNA

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:47.275
KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON AN

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.444
ALTERNATIVE TO- WERE SAID TO

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:53.181
BAKERSFIELD GIVEN THAT WE MAY

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.550
HAVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO

01:30:55.616 --> 01:31:00.354
COMPLETE OF. THE FULL VERSION

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.690
OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- THANK

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:05.726
YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK I

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:09.163
WOULD ANSWERED THIS WAY WE- MY

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:12.066
BOARD DIRECTED OUR STAFF BACK

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:12.567
IN I THINK IT WAS TWENTY

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.669
NINETEEN ORIGINALLY. TO CONDUCT

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:17.705
A SIDE BY SIDE. ROB REVIEW AND

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:21.242
ANALYSIS OF WOULD BE MONIES WE

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.944
WERE THEN IDENTIFYING AS THE

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.812
INCREMENTAL ABOUT BETWEEN WHAT

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:25.780
IT TAKES TO COMPLETE OUR

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:27.515
FEDERAL FUNDING GRANT

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.584
REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE THE

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.686
HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES OF TRACK.

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.787
AND ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:36.057
DONE STATEWIDE IN ADDITION.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:37.258
COMPLETING ALL OF THE BOOK AND

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.594
PROJECTS THAT WE NOW INVESTED

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.596
THAT INCLUDE HALF A BILLION

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:45.833
DOLLARS IN LA- FOR THE- I'LL

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.435
UNION STATION AND PROGRES

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:49.370
CROSSINGS AND IN THE BAY AREA

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:51.572
ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN. I

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:54.709
INTEGRATE CROSSING IN THE SANTA

01:31:54.775 --> 01:32:00.915
CLARA COUNTY- WE ARE. WE ARE

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:03.751
MOVING WE ARE MOVING FORWARD

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.953
WITH THAT AND WE AND WE ASK FOR

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.388
A SIDE BY SIDE STUDY ON THE

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:08.890
INCREMENTAL AMOUNT WHAT IS THE

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:11.325
BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THAT TO GET

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.361
MEANINGFUL BENEFIT FROM A

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:16.130
RIDERSHIP OF PERSPECTIVE M.

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:16.964
WHAT THAT SIDE BY SIDE

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:19.800
CONCLUDED WAS THAT EXTENDED

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.769
USING THOSE INCREMENTAL FUNDS

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:24.071
TO EXTEND TO BE ON THE ONE

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:24.872
NINETEEN TO THE CITIES OF THE

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.942
CENTRAL VALLEY MERCED BAKER'S.

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.744
GOT US THE MOST RIDERSHIP

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:31.178
BENEFIT FOR THE LIMITED

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:34.682
INVESTMENT FUNDS COMPARED TO

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:37.852
TRYING TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO DO

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.787
SEVEN DOLLAR CORRIDR SPECIFIC

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.289
WORK IN OTHER PLACES WHILE

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:43.190
OTHER PLACES HAVE MORE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.293
RIDERSHIP THEY ALSO HAVE THE I

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.595
THINK ROBUST TRANSIT OPERATIONS

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.930
AND THE INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.798
OUR MONEY IN THOSE DIDN'T

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:54.468
PRODUCE AS MUCH BENEFIT AS WELL

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:55.569
AS WHAT WE CAN PRODUCE IN THE

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:56.837
CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THERE'S

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:59.507
NOT MUCH THERE NOW AND SO

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:02.043
THAT'S WHAT THE SIDE BY SIDE

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:03.678
ANALYSIS SHOWED IT ALSO SHOWS.

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:08.316
TO GET TOTAL BENEFITS. OF WHAT

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:08.950
ONE NEEDED ON THE- CORRIDORS IN

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:11.485
THIS IN THE BAY AREA. THE MATCH

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:12.987
REQUIREMENT FOR OTHER FUNDS TO

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:16.557
COME INTO OUR- DELIVER. UP

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.960
ADDITIONAL- OPERATIONAL

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.895
BENEFITS WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:23.264
WHAT WE SAW. IN THE BALLOT IN

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:25.633
SO. WITH THAT CONCLUSION AND

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.101
THAT WAS A STUDY WE PUBLISHED I

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:29.070
THINK IN NINETEEN ORIGINALLY

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.604
AND TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:33.240
TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY BUT WE

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.508
TALKED ABOUT AN AWFUL LOT OF

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.277
OUR BOARD WE TALKED ABOUT OF

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.446
THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. LAST

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:39.947
SIX MONTHS WE SUBJECTED THAT

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.717
STUDY TO ADDITIONAL REVIEW SO

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:43.284
IN THAT STUDY WE LOOKED AT

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.619
ALTERNATIVES. WE GOT ADVICE ON

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:47.121
THE BEST WAY TO GO WITH THE

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.323
LIMITED FUNDS WE HAD AND THAT

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.391
CONCLUSION WAS GETTING

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.892
OPERATIONAL SEGMENT GOING

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:52.994
BETWEEN THE CITIES OF THE

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.862
CENTRAL VALLEY GIVEN. THAT

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.564
YOU'RE SPENDING BILLIONS ON

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.633
ASSETS THERE TODAY AND SO THAT

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.469
IS WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION WE

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:02.803
MADE TO OUR BOARD THE

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.872
RECOMMENDATION WE ARE MAKING TO

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.141
THIS BODY AND YOUR LIGHT OF THE

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:09.477
REVIEW THAT WAS DONE. IN RECENT

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:10.277
MONTHS IT'S STILL THE

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:14.448
RECOMMENDATION. THAT WE ARE

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:15.916
MAKING THAT SET. LOOK WE ARE

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.284
FOR. BACK INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:18.552
TRANSPORTATION UP AND DOWN THE

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.855
STATE AND WE KNOW THERE ARE A

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.189
LOT OF REVENUE OPTIONS TO DO

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.859
THAT SB ONE. WAS ONE NEW

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:27.228
FEDERAL MONEY WILL BE ANOTHER-

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:30.097
THERE'S OUT. OF OPTIONS AND A

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:31.832
LOT OF FUNDING REVENUE THAT'S

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:32.666
GOING INTO PROJECTS THAT WE DO

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:35.669
NOT GET. IN SO- WE THINK THIS

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:37.004
IS THE BEST USED TO GET OURS

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:39.573
GOING WE THINK. IT'S GOOD TO

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.308
FIND OTHER PROJECTS WITH A

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.277
BROADER SENSE OF RESOURCES THAT

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.012
WE CAN EXPAND ALL CLEAN

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.781
TRANSPORTATION ITEMS THE

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.816
OPTIONS. BUT IN THE STATE I

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:50.951
GUESS THE LAST THING I WOULD

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:52.820
JUST SAY IT'S I THINK A RISK.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.255
THAT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AS

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:56.557
WELL IF YOU JUST. WANT TO DO

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.060
THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES- ED

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:01.595
AND NOT ALLOW US TO CONSIDER

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:05.399
HOW TO USE THE REMAINING OF OUR

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:05.966
BUDGET TO GET MORE OPERATING

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:06.467
BENEFIT. YOU WILL SPEND

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.669
SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA BETWEEN

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:09.603
FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN BILLION

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:11.906
DOLLARS. TO BUILD A HUNDRED

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.774
NINETY MILE TRACK. CONTINUE TO

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.743
RUN DIESEL SERVICES ON THAT.

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:18.512
SCORE GO EIGHTEEN TRIPS A DAY

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:19.513
LEAVE IT BACK TO SEVEN OR

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.449
EIGHT. OF THEM CONTINUE TO

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.784
SHARE FREIGHT CORRIDORS. GET

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:26.153
INTO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:29.123
AND NOT SEE A SIZEABLE INCREASE

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:29.690
IN RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.659
VALLEY. AND WE THINK THERE'S A

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.261
BETTER WAY. WE THINK EXPANDING

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:36.530
BEYOND THAT. WHAT TOWARD WHAT

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.566
OUR BUDGET LIMITATIONS ARE. CAN

01:35:38.632 --> 01:35:40.601
GET BETTER BENEFIT IN

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:41.969
ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED TRAINS

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:43.838
GOING. IN CALIFORNIA SOONER.

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:46.107
THAT WE THINK. THE EXPENDITURE

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.274
OF OUR ADDITIONAL BUDGET

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:49.110
DOLLARS. IS WORTH WHILE TO

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:51.345
ACHIEVE THAT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:52.513
YOU'RE SPENDING FIFTEEN BILLION

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.781
DOLLARS AND HAVE NOT ACHIEVED

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:56.083
MUCH. AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO

01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:58.352
THAT. AND SO FOR US THAT'S A

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.820
PERSPECTIVE DIFFERENCE AND

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.655
THAT'S A CHANGE DIFFERENCE I.

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.124
JUST WANT TO REPEAT SOMETHING I

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.158
SAID EARLIER THERE'S NO

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:06.026

WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.869
COMMENCE THE ANALYSIS THE WORK

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.871
WE NEED. TO CONTINUE TO BRING

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.439
THIS BACK WE ARE NOT ASKING.

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:20.207
THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE US ALL

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.709

THAN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:45.226
MILLION. IS A GREATER THAN FIVE

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.961
HUNDRED MILLION. OR IS IT CLOSE

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.295

CHANGE ORDERS AS THEY COME IN

HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT WE

PUT IN THE BILL IS THE

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:11.819
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. LOCAL AN

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.354
ESTIMATE OF WORK A CHANGE

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.088
ORDERS THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.223
HAVE TO EXECUTE THAT ARE ABOVE

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:18.292
OUR ADOPTED BUDGET TO DATE AND

BUDGET MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.296
THOSE CHANGE ORDERS SO THAT'S

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.564
WHY WE CALL THAT THE KNOWN

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.600
COSTS INCREASE IN ADDITION WE

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:27.534
ARE ADVOCATING PUTTING A

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.069
BILLION DOLLARS IN A RISK

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.838
CONTINGENCY BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:31.772
THEY'LL STILL HAVE TO BE

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.841
COMMERCIALLY NEGOTIATED. WHICH

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.175
MEANS WHILE WE PUT OUT AN

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:38.012
ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE COST WE

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:38.646
ALSO KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:41.148
A COMMERCIAL CONVERSATION IN

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:43.017
SETTLEMENT ON SOME OF THOSE

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:44.818
THINGS THAT MUST GET DONE TO

COMPLETE THE WORK AND I DON'T

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.721
HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU TO

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:49.189
EXACTLY WHERE THAT WILL GO BUT

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.891
WE HAVE A WE ARE PROPOSING TO

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.493
ADOPT THE BUDGET THAT WILL

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:54.862
HANDLE. THE THREE THIRTY AND

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.430
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:57.164
THING ABOUT THE RISK

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:59.099
CONTINGENCY IS THAT IT'S NOT

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:00.067
JUST DESIGNED FOR THIS CHANGE

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:02.736
ORDERS BUT OTHER RISKS IN LIFE

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.038
LIKE WE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:06.407
THE COVERT NINETEEN EXPERIENCE

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.609
I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION THAT

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:11.578
IT DID AFFECT OUR- OUR

01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:12.479
TIMELINES IT HAS AFFECTED OUR

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:18.152
SCHEDULE WHENEVER YOU AFFECTS.

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:19.086
SCHEDULE WITH THAT MONEY. AND

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.287
WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT ONE OF

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:22.589
THE- ABOUT THAT. AND SO AGAIN

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.591
NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY

01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:25.526
FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO HANDLE

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:27.461
THIS. BUT USING OUR CURRENT

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:30.264
BUDGET. TO ADOPT A BROADER BASE

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.732
LINE THAT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:34.501
MORE RESEARCH. AND COVERS WHAT

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:35.402
WE KNOW OUR COSTS THAT WILL

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.404
COME. TO A COMPLETE THE WORK IN

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:39.940
ABOUT. SO THE ONE POINT THREE

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.643
TOTAL IS DESIGN- TO BE

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:43.310
SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL OF

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.713
THOSE THINGS. AND COMPLETE OUR

IT IS CERTAINLY HAVE VERY CLEAR

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:00.627
THAT THERE IS A BIPARTISAN

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:03.197
CONCERN OF THE INADEQUACY OF

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:05.966
THE FUNDING- MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.468
ORANGE COUNTY HIGHLIGHTED A

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:08.736
POTENTIAL ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:11.572
GAP- IN THE FIRST SEGMENT- THE

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.706
AUTHORITY DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.341
PRESENTED A CREDIBLE PLAN TO

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.009
FILL THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY.

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.010
MILLION DOLLAR GAP FOR THE

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:18.679
WHOLE PROJECT I WANT TO

HIGHLIGHT AND ASK YOU TO GO

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:22.716
INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL-

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.351
ON PAGE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:26.487
OF YOUR ANALYSIS OF THE PLAN

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:28.422
YOU ARE YOU HIGHLIGHT. NEAR

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:30.457
TERM CHALLENGES AND LONG TERM

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:32.426
FUNDING CHALLENGES-

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:34.862
SPECIFICALLY- ACTUAL COSTS FOR

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:36.497
THE MERCED BIG SHOW SEGMENT TO

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:39.099
BE HIRED ANTICIPATED UNCLEAR

01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:42.069
EXPECT FUNDING- FORMER SAID THE

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.203
BIGGEST FAILED TO MATERIALIZE

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.305
AND CLEAR TIMING AS FUNDING-

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.640
THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.175
PROJECT NEEDS TO AND THEN- I

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:50.043
SPECIFICALLY ACTUAL PROJECT

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.545
COSTS BEING HIGHER THAN CURRENT

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:53.614
ESTIMATES EACH YEAR. OR YOU AND

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.949
YOUR COLLEAGUES WROTE- IF H. S.

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.351
R. A. APPLY THIS REVISED

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:58.919
APPROACH TO THE FULL PHASE ONE

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.621
OF THE PROJECT WOULD EXPECT

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:01.789
THAT THE ESTIMATED BASELINE

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.724
BUDGET WOULD BE HIGHER. THAN

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:04.825
THE CURRENT EIGHTY POINT THREE

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:06.126
BILLION ESTIMATE POTENTIALLY BY

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:07.694
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:09.463
NO FUNDING PLAN BEYOND MERCED

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:11.632
TO BAKERSFIELD AND YOU CONCLUDE

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.467
BY SAYING IF PROJECT COSTS ARE

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.068
ALSO HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:16.136
THIS FUNDING GAP WOULD BE EVEN

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:17.805
GREATER. SO COULD YOU GO INTO

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:19.640
SOME MORE SPECIFICS ON TERMS OF

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.742
THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE FUNDING

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.977
AND WHY THERE ARE THESE NEAR

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:25.712
TERM FUNDING CHALLENGES AS WELL

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:26.747
AS THE CONCERNS AS OF THE

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:32.920
LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF. VALUE

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:33.420

YEAR A VALUE THAT PREVIOUS

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:40.828
DRAFT OF THE TWO TWENTY

BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS IN THE

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:44.465
LAST YEAR. I IN THAT- ANALYSIS

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:46.133
WE RAISED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.067
POTENTIAL ISSUES FOR

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.335
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.336
REGARDING WITH THE SCHEDULE AS

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.572
WELL AS WITH REGARD TO THAT

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:53.807
COST AND FUNDING AVAILABLE. I'M

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.175
AND I THINK IN THIS

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.944
CONVERSATION TODAY WE FOCUS A

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.245
LOT JUST ON THIS MERCED TO

01:41:58.312 --> 01:41:59.413
BAKERSFIELD IS THERE GONNA BE

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.214
ENOUGH MONEY FOR CENTER

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.583
BAKERSFIELD- AND AGAIN IT'S AS

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:04.685
I MENTIONED- THERE'S NOT

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.786
CERTAINTY THAT THERE WILL BE

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.621
THERE. BUT I THINK EVEN BEYOND

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:10.257
THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY A

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:11.758
FUNDING GAP IF YOU WANT TO GO

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:13.260
BEYOND PERCENT TO BAKERSFIELD.

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:15.095
ON TO COMPLETE NINE BALLY AND

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:17.397
THEN AGAIN TO COMPLETE PHASE

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.132
ONE SO THAT THE EIGHTY POINT

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:19.700
THREE BILLION THAT YOU WERE

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:21.335
REFERENCING WITH THE NUMBER-

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:24.438
LAST YEAR. AND THAT WAS RELATED

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.506
TO YOU KNOW THE ESTIMATE THAT

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:27.074
TIME FOR COMPLETING PHASE ONE

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.775
BUT THAT ESTIMATE REALLY DIDN'T

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:30.611
EVALUATE FULLY RE EVALUATE THE

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.513
COST OF THE ENTIRE. OF THE

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:40.153
ENTIRE FEES ONE SO WE THINK.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:40.988
YOU KNOW IF THE AUTHORITY. DO

01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:42.089
WE ABOUT. CHRISTOPHER THE

01:42:42.155 --> 01:42:43.357
GROUND THAT WHAT THAT COST BE

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:43.957
IT WOULD LIKELY SEEING. HOW

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.726
THAN AND I KNOW IT FOR THINGS

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:48.295
LIKE. YOU KNOW THIS- THAT

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:49.429
ASSUMING THAT NOW REALLY IS A

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.365
SCHEDULE THAT. WERE PLANNED ON

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:53.033
FULL FINDING OF THE ENTIRE

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.402
PHASE ONE WHICH- WHICH- IS NOT

01:42:55.469 --> 01:43:00.407
IS NOT THE CASE SO- AND AS-

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.276
BRAND HI CAL REFEREE. YOU KNOW

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:03.277
WHEN THEY'RE DELAY THAT

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.945
TRANSLATES INTO INCREASED COSTS

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.446
USUALLY IN CONSTRUCTION WORLD.

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:07.514
SO CERTAINLY WE THINK THOSE

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.749
COSTS WOULD LIKELY BE HIGHER IF

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.117
THEY WERE IF THE WHOLE PROJECT

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:12.786
COST WITHOUT WERE REEVALUATED.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.421
AND THERE WOULD BE A FUNDING

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:17.090
GAP TO DO PHASE ONE- CERTAINLY

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.159
IN THE IN THE TENS OF BILLIONS

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:21.228
IF NOT MORE SO- THERE IS A

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:22.729
SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING GOT TO DO

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:25.098
THAT- THAT'S- REALLY. YOU KNOW

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.533
I THINK I CRITICAL QUESTION FOR

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.168
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS.

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.937
YES WELL AS THE CONNECTED

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.005
FINDING AGAIN NOT JUST RESET

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.840
THE BAKERSFIELD IF THE FUNDING

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:35.309
DOESN'T MATERIALIZE FOR THAT

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:37.044
THERE COULD BE. A GAP THERE AND

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:39.446
THE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE BYE.

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.248
BYE BUT FOR COMMUTING TO

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.516
FINDING VALUE VALLEY AND

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:44.518
EVENTUALLY PHASE WINE AND IN

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:45.586
THAT CASE THERE'S AND THERE'S A

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:47.287
MUCH LARGER FUNDING GAP AND

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.856
THAT'S- PROBABLY UNLIKELY TO BE

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.358
FULLY FILLED BY BY FEDERAL

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.327
DOLLARS ON. AND SO THERE

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.828
PROBABLY WOULD NEED TO BE

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.496
ADDITIONAL STATE DOLLARS AND SO

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:57.297
I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:59.766
WANNA CONSIDER. ITS TOLERANCE

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:00.534
FOR COMMITTING ADDITIONAL

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.769
DOLLARS TO THAT- SO I DON'T

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.137
KNOW. IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.172
THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:07.174
THERE BUT BUT THAT WAS. THAT

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:14.047
WAS RETURNED TO OUR. MAIN

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:14.948
POINTS. AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU-

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:16.249
WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.618
FOLLOWED BY MEMBERS LIAM

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.319
CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU AND I

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:20.120
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:21.655
PRESENTATION WHEN LOOKING AT

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.323
THE TWENTY TWENTY COLVIN IMPACT

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:25.058
TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL I'M

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.526
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ITEMS%

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:27.628
YOU HAVE MY QUESTION IS WITH

01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:30.230
CODE WE- WE- SAW THAT WE HAD A

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:31.231
LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WOULD

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:32.599
NORMALLY BE COMMUTERS. WERE

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.167
STAYING AT HOME TO WORKING WAS

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:35.636
THAT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:37.604
IN REGARDS TO THE REVENUE- ON

01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:39.640
RIDERSHIP GOING FORWARD SINCE A

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.975
LOT OF THESE OF WORKFORCE WILL

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:43.443
BE STAYING AT HOME AND WILL NOT

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:48.181
BE TAKING THE TRAIN. THANK YOU.

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:49.383
OPERATIONAL SEGMENT DOESN'T

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:53.086
BEGIN UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY NINE

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:55.188
TWENTY THIRTY FISCAL YEAR- AND

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:56.289
WE CERTAINLY HOPE WILL PASS

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:58.325
THE- CALL THE IMPACT OF THAT I

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.327
THINK. EVERY SURVEY I'VE SEEN

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.029
ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER.

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.930
THERE'S AN EXPECTATION AFTER

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:05.465
VACCINES ARE FULLY KICKED IN

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:08.035
AND- WE'RE BEYOND THIS- THIS

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:10.170
CALL WITH. A PERIOD. THAT THAT

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.338
THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:13.707
RIDERSHIP WILL RETURN. TO

01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:15.509
TRANSIT OPERATIONS- GOING

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:17.110
FORWARD INSTANCE ARE OPERATING

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:19.846
TIMELINE IS BUT SO FAR OUT I

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:21.014
DON'T. WE DON'T FEEL LIKE

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:22.916
THERE'S- MUCH TO CHANGE IN

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:23.884
TERMS OF THE RIDERSHIP

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.986
ESTIMATES BECAUSE POINT BUT

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:26.586
IT'S SOMETHING TO MONITOR AND

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.122
CONTINUE TO. UP SEE WHAT HOW

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:30.791
THINGS COME BACK FROM COVERED

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:33.093
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BUT

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.594
NINE YEARS OUT FROM TODAY SO

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:36.396
WHAT BY THAT TIME WE CERTAINLY

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:39.433
THINK. THAT THERE WILL BE- A

01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:41.501
FULL SORT OF RECOVERY FROM

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:44.137
THIS. PARTICULAR PANDEMIC IN

01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:44.671
THAT RIDERSHIP WILL LIKELY

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:49.476
RETURN. CLICK ON THAT PLEASE- I

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:50.877
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WITH THE

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:52.312
WORK FOR STAYING AT HOME THIS

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:53.547
IS JUST A NEW WAY OF WORKING

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.015
IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF THE

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:56.183
VACCINATION IS GOING TO MAKE A

01:45:56.249 --> 01:45:57.984
DIFFERENCE AND SO THAT REALLY

01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:59.519
IS MY QUESTION THAT I THINK A

01:45:59.586 --> 01:46:01.221
LOT OF- A LOT OF US ARE GOING

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:02.589
TO STAY AT HOME WORK AND WE'RE

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:03.223
NOT GOING TO NEED THIS TYPE OF

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:05.425
TRANSPORTATION- SO. I THINK

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:06.259
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:07.194
BE LOOKED IN AND YOU'RE TALKING

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.128
THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO BE

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.664
INTO CONSIDERATION- FOR ABOUT

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.899
NINE YEARS SO- I APPRECIATE

01:46:12.966 --> 01:46:17.304
YOUR TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE.

01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:18.138
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.239
PRESENTATION AT THE CONCERT

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:20.974
CHAIR I JUST WANNA I HAVE A

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:23.376
QUESTION FOR PEER REVIEW GROUP

01:46:23.443 --> 01:46:24.344
SPEAKER BUT JUST WANTED TO

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.213
REITERATE ALSO MY CONTACTS MY

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:28.115
QUESTION IS THAT I AM A STRONG

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:29.583
SUPPORTER OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:31.685
FACT YOU KNOW ALMOST TWO

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:32.886
HUNDRED YEARS AGO MY ANCESTORS

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.888
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME CAME

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:36.990
TO AMERICA TO BUILD A RAILROAD

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.625
THAT TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY A

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.393
RAILROAD SYSTEM THAT WE LARGELY

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.695
STILL RELY ON TODAY WITH ARE

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.630
VERY SLOW DIESEL POWERED.

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.599
TRAINS AND WE STATE POWER ALONG

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.000
A SO MY QUESTION TO ENSURE THAT

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:49.936
THIS VISION IS ACTUALIZED AND

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:51.905
CONTINUES TO BE A HALLMARK OF

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:52.372
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:53.940
HOPEFULLY CENTURIES THE CALM

01:46:54.007 --> 01:46:56.710
IS- IN IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:58.278
TALKED ABOUT PROPOSING

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.646
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR THE

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:01.214
PROJECT COULD YOU ELABORATE ON

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:02.582
SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:47:02.649 --> 01:47:03.917
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:07.654
OPTIONS. TO KEEP OUR THIS

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:13.160
PROJECT GOING. THANK YOU THANK

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:15.162
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION HONESTLY

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:16.396
BECAUSE I THINK IT MAY BE THE

01:47:16.463 --> 01:47:18.899
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION SOMEONE

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:21.902
HAS ASKED ALL. THE PROBLEM THAT

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:23.637
THE PROJECT HAS HAD FROM THE

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:25.772
BEGINNING INSTEAD IT IS NOT AN

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.808
ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND IT

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:29.776
IS NOT A PROGRAM OF THE

01:47:29.843 --> 01:47:30.243
GOVERNOR AND HELP WAS

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:33.446
ESTABLISHED. IN A PROPOSITION

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:36.082
ALL AND THAT PROPOSITION DID

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:37.717
NOT ESTABLISH AN ADEQUATE

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:39.719
FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT IN FACT

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:44.057
IT WAS. NEVER FUNDED ALL FULLY.

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:45.592
AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:47.160
PROJECT HAS STRUGGLED EVER

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:49.563
SINCE WITH THE ISSUE OF WHAT

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.331
CAN WE PAY FOR AND WHAT CAN WE

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:54.067
BUILT. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:57.437
EVERY BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT THE

01:47:57.504 --> 01:47:59.673
SCOPE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM ONE

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.641
PLAN TO THE NEXT PARTLY BECAUSE

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:03.143
COSTS ARE GOING UP IN PART

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.879
BECAUSE- IT HAS BECOME THEY THE

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:08.448
SOURCES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.917
MATERIALIZE DID NOT. AND AS WE

01:48:10.984 --> 01:48:13.053
I SAID IN OUR STATEMENT WE'VE

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.821
SAID IN OUR LETTERS BEFORE.

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:17.023
THIS PROJECT CAN NEVER BE

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:19.826
MANAGED ADEQUATELY AND STABLY

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:22.028
WITHOUT ADEQUATE AND STABLE

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:23.563
FUNDING. TO PUT THIS IN

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:27.300
PERSPECTIVE- WE STARTED ON THIS

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:29.736
PROJECT IN THE IN TWO THOUSAND

01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:31.371
EIGHT OR SO IN THAT SAME PERIOD

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:33.273
OF TIME THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:36.243
HAS BUILT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:38.011
MILES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. NOW

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:39.713
I'M NOT ARGUING WE SHOULD ADOPT

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.548
THEIR APPROACH BUT I DO WANT TO

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.416
MAKE THE POINT THAT. THAT WITH

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.952
ADEQUATE FUNDING. RESOURCES AND

01:48:46.019 --> 01:48:48.488
ADEQUATE PLANNING AND ADEQUATE

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:51.591
LOCATION. THINGS CAN GET DONE.

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:53.593
ALL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.528
OF THOSE AND- YEAH I DON'T

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:57.297
THINK WE HAVE AN AGREED VISION

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:59.199
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.568
GOVERNOR ASKED WHAT SHOULD

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.236
ULTIMATELY GET DONE. AND WE

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:05.538
CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A STABLE

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:07.574
AND ADEQUATE FUNDING PLAN TO

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:09.876
GET THAT DONE. ALL UP THERE ARE

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:11.912
PLENTY OF WAYS THAT THE STATE

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:13.680
SHARE COULD BE FINANCED IF WE

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.548
WANTED TO THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.550
THAT DIFFICULT WE DISCUSSED

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:19.953
THIS BEFORE- EDITIONS TO THE

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:22.822
GAS TAX SUGAR TAX ADDITIONS TO

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.991
VARIOUS VEHICLE TAXES OF ONE

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:26.559
KIND OR THE OTHER. THERE ARE

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:32.232
PLENTY OF WAYS. COULD BE

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:35.035
FINANCED IF THE VISION IS

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.237
AGREED AND IF IT IS ADOPTED. SO

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:38.738
I CAME INTO THE KEY ISSUE

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.907
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:43.109
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WHAT WE

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.111
WANT TO DO. AND WHAT ARE WE

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:47.614
WILLING TO PAY FOR. A AND I

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:50.150
THINK- YOU HANDLE AS WE SAID

01:49:50.216 --> 01:49:52.819
THE CHANCE BECAUSE THE A

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:55.355
PROJECT- IS IN A KIND OF A

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:57.524
CONSOLIDATION POSITION RIGHT

01:49:57.590 --> 01:50:00.026
NOW. YOU HAVE A CHANCE THE WITH

01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:02.062
THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.496
TO SEE WHAT THE PICTURE OF

01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:05.298
FEDERAL FUNDING WILL BE. MORE

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:07.000
OF A CHANCE TO SEE MUCH BETTER

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:09.302
WHAT THE COST OF THE LINKS AND

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:13.273
THEN EVENTUALLY THE COMPLETION

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:13.907
OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE. AND YOU

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:15.542
HAVE A CHEN TO SPEAK TO SEE THE

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:17.177
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:18.545
WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR THE

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.380

OPERATED YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:24.951
SEE THAT JAIL. M. M. IN A

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.020
RECOMMENDATION IS THIS FOR THE

01:50:27.087 --> 01:50:28.989
LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON THAT.

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:31.992
BUT WE DO WANT YOU TO BE AWARE

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.293
THAT IT IS THERE IS A

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.261
SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF THAT NEW

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:36.963
MONEY OF SOME KIND WILL BE

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:39.366
REQUIRED EVEN TO COMPLETE THE

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:42.102
OF BAKERSFIELD TO UP PERCENT

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:45.238
SELECTION. AND AS OF THE L. A.

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.707
O. PERSON HELEN KIRSTEN SAID IT

CERTAINLY WILL BE REQUIRED IN

01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:55.281
ORDER. TO GO OUTSIDE THAT AREA.

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:59.252
THANK YOU ARE A APPARENTLY OUR

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.320

QUESTIONER- ROUND ONE IS

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.126
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IF

01:51:06.192 --> 01:51:07.694
ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT ASK

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:09.829
QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE TO BE

01:51:09.896 --> 01:51:11.798
ADDED TO THE LIST LET ME KNOW

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:13.433
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.104
QUESTION FOR MR KELLY. I LOOK

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.173
THROUGH THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.275
AND SOME OF THE ITEMS CONTAINED

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:25.845
IN IT. AND I DON'T SEE ANY-

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:27.947
ANYTHING ALLOCATING FUNDS TO

01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:29.816
LITIGATION OR LITIGATION RISK

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:32.285
WHICH IS CURIOUS TO ME. BECAUSE

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:34.621
IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. THERE

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:36.589
MAYBE MAYBE THERE ARE THERE

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:37.857
COULD BE LAWSUITS BROUGHT

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:40.226
AGAINST THIS PROJECT- MAKING

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:42.328
THE ARGUMENT THAT BECAUSE THE

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:44.297
SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE PROJECT

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:46.299
HAS BEEN CHANGED MATERIALLY.

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:49.736
FROM WHAT THE VOTERS PASSED IN

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:50.336
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN THE PROP

01:51:50.403 --> 01:51:53.706
ONE A BOND- PROP ONE INITIATIVE

01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:55.608
TO AUTHORIZE THE BONDS. THAT

01:51:55.675 --> 01:51:57.811
ARE CHANGING THE SCOPE OF THIS

01:51:57.877 --> 01:52:00.313
TO BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED- D.

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.382
ELECTRIFYING IT. MAKING IT

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:04.918
SINGLE TRACK AT CETERA- DOES

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:07.220
NOT. COMPORT WITH THE WILL OF

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:08.822
THE VOTERS WHEN THEY PASSED THE

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:09.789
ORIGINAL BOND WHEN THEY WERE

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:11.558
TOLD. BY THE WAY THAT THIS

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:13.493
WOULD BE A CONNECTING TRAIN

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.894
BETWEEN THE BAY AREA AND LOS

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:19.065
ANGELES. WHICH IS NOT. AND THAT

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:21.367
IT WOULD. MAKE THAT TRIP IN TWO

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:23.269
AND A HALF HOURS OR LESS WHICH

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:25.738
IT WON'T. SO I'VE ASKED THIS

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:27.207
BEFORE MISTER KELLY AND I'M

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:28.374
HOPING THAT YOU CAN GIVE US AN

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:29.976
UPDATE AS TO WHY THERE'S NO

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:30.910
LITIGATION RISK IN YOUR

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.679
BUSINESS PLAN. AND THE STATUS

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:34.080
OF ANY LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:35.949
BROUGHT ARGUING THAT. AND

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.016
WHETHER YOU FORESEE THAT BEING

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.818
A PROBLEM AS THE SCOPE OF THIS

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:40.520
PROJECT HAS MATERIALLY CHANGED

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:44.424
THANK YOU. I THINK THERE'S

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.792
SEVERAL ANSWERS TO THAT THE

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:48.294
FIRST IS- WE DO IDENTIFYING THE

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.430
RISKS OF SECTION LITIGATION AS

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:52.932
A- REST FOR THIS PROJECT WE

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:55.935
HAVE HAD LITIGATION. OVER ALL

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.704
ELEMENTS OF THIS PROJECT FROM.

01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:59.072
OF BILLS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:01.274
PASSED TO ALLOW US TO DO EARLY

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:02.008
INVESTMENTS LIKE IN THE

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:04.077
CALTRAIN. CORRIDOR THAT WERE

01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:06.779
LITIGATED- WE WANT EARLY COURT

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:08.181
DECISIONS ON THOSE I BELIEVE

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:10.049
THE- THAT'S STILL ON THE

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:14.654
BALLOT- IT TODAY- WE- HAVE

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.089
SETTLED. ALL KINDS OF

01:53:16.156 --> 01:53:17.223
LITIGATION THE VALLEY'S

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:18.091
BROWNING OF OUR MIDDLE

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:21.261
DOCUMENTS AND- WE WANT PREVIOUS

01:53:21.327 --> 01:53:22.896
CASES. ON HOW WE CAN MOVE

01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.063
FORWARD WITH SPENDING BOND

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.231
DOLLARS OR OTHER FUNDS

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.633
DEDICATED TO THIS PROJECT TO

01:53:26.699 --> 01:53:28.134
BUILD WHAT WE'RE BUILDING. OUT

01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:30.203
SO. YES LITIGATION IS ALWAYS A

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:31.671
RISK ON THIS PROJECT IT HAS

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:33.706
BEEN SINCE DAY ONE. I IT HAS

01:53:33.773 --> 01:53:35.141
COST THE SCHEDULED TIME AND

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:38.311
MONEY- AND WE HAVE- EITHER

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:40.547
SETTLED OR- THEN VICTORIOUS ON

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:42.582
VIRTUALLY ALL LITIGATION. UP TO

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:44.918
THIS POINT- AND SO THAT'S

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:45.919
THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE STAND

01:53:45.985 --> 01:53:47.554
ON LITIGATION I GUESS I WOULD

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.622
DISPUTE. THE CHARACTERIZATION

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:52.292
THAT SAYS WE'RE GETTING AWAY.

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:54.194
FROM PROP ONE NAY. I THINK IT.

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:56.296
IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:57.463
WHAT WE ARE DOING. IS

01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:59.899
RECOGNIZING. AS WAS THE CASE

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.668
THAT THEY THE BOND BILL WAS

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:03.736
APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT.

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.438
WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.173
BUILD THE ENTIRETY. OF PHASE

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.909
ONE. SO WE COME FORTH WITH

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:11.644
PLANS ON HOW WE GET THERE

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:13.713
INCREMENTALLY. THE ULTIMATE

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.481
DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:17.450
SYSTEM WILL MEET ALL THE

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.185
REQUIREMENTS OF THE FACE. OF

01:54:19.252 --> 01:54:21.988
THE PROP ONE A SYSTEM. AND WE

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:23.356
ARE NOT THE ONES ADVOCATING TO

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:25.091
GET AWAY FROM ELECTRIFICATION.

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:27.460
ON THE CONTRARY WE'RE THE ONES

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.195
PUSHING. FOR ELECTRIFICATION.

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:32.999
ELECTRIFICATION IS THE ONLY WAY

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:33.499
YOU GET HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.802
ANYWHERE WITHOUT IT DON'T HAVE

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:37.937
HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND SO WE ARE

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:44.077
PUSHING FOR THAT. WE HAVE. TO

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:44.644
LAY OUT A VISION BECAUSE J.

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:45.845
WHAT LOU THOMPSON JUST TALK

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:46.879
ABOUT. BECAUSE NEVER BEEN A IS

01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:49.048
NOT A STATE SOURCE FUNDING THE-

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:51.117
AND BUILD ALL OF THE PHASE ONE

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:53.119
SYSTEM. WE LAY OUT HOW WE WILL

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:54.921
GET THERE WITH WHAT WE HAVE.

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:56.055
AND WHAT WE PUT IN THIS

01:54:56.122 --> 01:54:58.725
BUSINESS PLAN IS ELECTRIFIED HI

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.994
SPEED SYSTEM. BETWEEN MERCED

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.862
AND BAKERSFIELD AS THE FIRST

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:05.598
BUILDING BLOCK. THE COMPLETION

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:06.799
OF ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.302
DOCUMENTS FROM LA TO SAN

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.604
FRANCISCO AND ANNA- THAT WOULD

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:14.607
LAY OUT THE PATH IF THE TRACK.

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:16.109
OPERATIONAL MODE IN THE DESIGN

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.877
SHOULD MAKE THE PROP ONE EIGHT

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:19.779
REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL NEED

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:21.614
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO DELIVER

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.883
THAT AND WE HAVE NEVER SAID

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.685
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. AND

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:27.587
CERTAINLY SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:28.755
I'VE PREPARED BEFORE THIS

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:31.190
LEGISLATURE MANY TIMES AND I'VE

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.159
SET. I'M GIVING YOU EXACTLY

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:34.227
WHERE OUR CHALLENGES AND

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:36.496
OPPORTUNITIES ARE ARE JOB IN

01:55:36.562 --> 01:55:38.031
THESE PLANS IS TO LAY OUT OUR

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:40.133
PATH TO DO IT. AND AS LUKE

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:42.001
THOMPSON AND L. A. L. HE SAID

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:44.170
THE BIG CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.438
DO IT WITHOUT HAVING SUFFICIENT

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:47.373
FUNDS TO BUILD AT ALL. SO WE

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.108
LAY OUT PROPOSAL OF HOW WE'LL

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:50.677
DO IT UNDER A BILDING BLOCK

01:55:50.743 --> 01:55:53.012
APPROACH. JEFF MORE FEDERAL

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:55.481
MONEY COMES IN WE WILL DO MORE

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.550
AND WE WILL EXTEND FURTHER. AND

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.652
I LOOK FORWARD TO. WE DON'T

01:55:59.719 --> 01:56:01.120
KNOW THAT AS OF TODAY SO WE

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:04.157

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:04.857
HOW WE CAN GET ONE. I JUST

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:08.995
GOING. UP OUT WITH THE FUN THAT

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:13.099

AND- ALSO JUST FOLLOWING UP ON

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.284
OUR CONVERSATION FROM LAST WEEK

01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:33.686
I I'D BE INTERESTED AND CURIOUS

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:37.390
TO KNOW AND FOR THE RECORD. I

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:39.659
AND MOST VERY STRONG SUPPORTER

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:41.027
OF THIS PROJECT I'VE ALWAYS

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:43.396
BEEN MY ONLY AND THIS IS

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.897
SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:45.565
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW

01:56:45.631 --> 01:56:47.367
YEARS. MY ONLY FRUSTRATION IS

01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:48.768
THAT THIS PROJECT STARTED IN

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.803
CENTRAL VALLEY AND NOT IN- LOS

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:53.172
ANGELES CONNECTING TO NORTH

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:56.409
LANCASTER PALMDALE WHERE- AS

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:57.477
I'VE SAID BEFORE THERE'S A

01:56:57.543 --> 01:57:00.079
SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC CONGESTION

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:02.148
AND A GREAT DEAL OF NEED. THIS

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.850
IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT AND

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:05.385
I DON'T SEE IT AS SOMETHING

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:07.186
THAT'S GOING TO NECESSARILY THE

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.521
IMPORTANCE OF IT ISN'T TAKE

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:11.090
CONNECT LA TO BAY AREA BUT ITS

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:12.592
IMPORTANCE IS THE REGIONAL

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:14.861
CONNECTION. IT'S TO MAKE SURE

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:18.030
THAT PEOPLE ARE UTILIZING THEIR

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:20.400
INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES LESS IN

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.268
THOSE SHORT SHORT ONE HOUR TWO

01:57:22.335 --> 01:57:24.637
HOUR INTERVAL DRIVES WHICH THEN

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:27.640
BECOMES EVEN LONGER BECAUSE OF

01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:30.042
THE CONGESTED IMPACT AND THE

01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:31.177
WEAR AND TEAR ON EVERYTHING

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:33.913
ELSE THAT ENSUES BECAUSE OF

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:38.484
THAT- SO GETTING OFF OF THE

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.186
SOAPBOX FOR A MINUTE AND

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:41.587
GETTING INTO PRACTICAL NUMBERS

01:57:41.654 --> 01:57:43.156
AND TO THE QUESTION PLEASE.

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:46.225
THANK YOU. HOW MUCH DO YOU

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:46.793
ENVISION COMING IN FROM THE

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:52.365
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT THAT'S

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.400
A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN I LIKE

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:55.468
TO START WITH GETTING THE

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:57.837
BILLION BACK THAT THE TRUMP

01:57:57.904 --> 01:57:59.238
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO TAKE-

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.740
I'VE WORKED WITH I THINK WE'RE

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:04.811
ALL GOING TO SEE MORE- AS THE-

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:05.945
CONGRESS MOVES PASSED THE

01:58:06.012 --> 01:58:08.047
STIMULUS CONVERSATION AND

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:09.782
APPEARS TO BE GETTING INTO AN

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:11.717
INFRASTRUCTURE CONVERSATION-

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:13.553
YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:14.387
ENOUGH TO BILL BEYOND THE

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.122
CENTER ABOUT- WHETHER THAT'S

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:17.924
SOUTHWARD TO PALMDALE AND

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:20.159
CERTAINLY INTO THE THAT GET THE

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:20.760
VALLEY TO VALLEY SYSTEM GOING

01:58:20.827 --> 01:58:22.695
INTO THE BAYAREA. THAT'S

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.563
EXPENSIVE AND IT WILL TAKE A

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:24.964
LOT OF MONEY BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:26.666
HOW BIG EXACTLY THEY'RE

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.701
PLANNING TO GO I KNOW THEY WERE

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.269
THERE SEEMS TO BE A REAL PUSH

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:32.872
TO BUILD THIS KIND OF STUFF WE

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.273
DIDN'T ASK FOR A SPECIFIC

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.375
DOLLAR SIGN BUT WE ARE ASKING

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:37.677
FOR A SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.111
WHAT WE WOULD ULTIMATELY LIKE

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:41.747
TO SEE HAS. YOU KNOW TO DATE

01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:42.815
WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY WE HAVE

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:44.083
RECEIVED IN THE STATE

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:46.052
COMMISSION ON THIS PROJECT THIS

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.086
IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:49.055
PARTNERSHIP PROJECT BUT AS OF

01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:51.090
TODAY THE STATE IS SPENDING

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:53.626
THIS IS ACCOUNTING FOR MORE

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:55.528
THAN 80% OF THAT BUDGET AND WE

01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:57.930
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BALLOTS

01:58:57.997 --> 01:58:59.832
FOR AND IF WE IF WE GOT THAT TO

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:02.235
MORE TRADITIONAL SORT OF STATE

01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:04.704
FEDERAL COMMITMENTS THAT WOULD

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.439
ALMOST REVERSE AND THAT WOULD

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:07.940
ENABLE US TO DO AN AWFUL LOT

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:10.076
MORE. SO I DON'T HAVE A

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:11.444
SPECIFIC NUMBER THAT WE'RE

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:13.779
EXPECTING I JUST DON'T KNOW

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:15.081
THAT WE'VE HAD COMMUNICATION

01:59:15.147 --> 01:59:16.883
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THESE KINDS

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.518
OF PROJECTS ARE UP TO THE

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:20.319
FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:23.122
COUNTRY OKAY SO IT IF THE

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.990
CHURCH DOESN'T MIND ME

01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:26.526
CONTINUING I KNOW WE NEED TO

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:29.395
WORK WITH GOALS AND I THINK I

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:30.496
THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:33.332
BE- OF HELP IF THERE ARE

01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:34.967
SPECIFIC GOALS THAT WE CAN

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:37.470
TARGET SO WHAT IS YOUR WISH

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:39.305
LIST WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT IS

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:45.678
IT THAT YOU WANT. WHAT. IS IT

01:59:45.745 --> 01:59:46.279
THAT YOU WANT IS. A REALISTIC

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.014
NUMBER. OF WHAT ARE THE BENCH.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.849
AND WHAT IS IT WHAT WE CAN BE

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:53.085
PUSHING FOR AND STRIVING FOR.

01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:55.021
OUR APPROACH THIS AGAIN KEEPING

01:59:55.087 --> 01:59:56.556
IN MIND I KNOW I HEARD WHAT YOU

01:59:56.622 --> 01:59:58.291
SAID ABOUT YOU KNOW.

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.226
UNFORTUNATE FROM YOUR

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:00.860
PERSPECTIVE THAT STARTED IN THE

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:03.629
VALLEY. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT

02:00:03.696 --> 02:00:04.297
DECISION YOU CAN MAKE THAT

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.933
DECISION- BUT THAT IS THE PLACE

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:08.768
THAT IT STARTED IN SO THE FIRST

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:09.402
THING I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:11.671
OUR GOAL IS. WE DON'T INTEND TO

02:00:11.737 --> 02:00:13.639
LEAVE THE VALLEY WITHOUT HAVING

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:16.008
A VALUABLE SYSTEM THERE. SO I

02:00:16.075 --> 02:00:17.176
WOULD SAY THE FIRST THING IS TO

02:00:17.243 --> 02:00:18.578
MAKE SURE WE CAN GET AN

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:20.279
OPERATING SYSTEM GOING THERE

02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:23.049
THAT MAKES SENSE SECONDLY. I

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:25.351
WOULD. HI I'M BETTING COURAGE

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:28.154
BY WORK IN THE BAY AREA AND THE

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.222
IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL

02:00:30.289 --> 02:00:31.924
REGIONAL MATCHING FUNDS FROM

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:33.759
THE BAY AREA TO EXPAND OUR

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:35.795
VALLEY SERVICE FROM THE CENTRAL

02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:37.563
VALLEY INTO SILICON VALLEY.

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:39.231
WHICH HAS TREMENDOUS RIDERSHIP

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.200
BENEFITS FOR US SO THAT IS A

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.435
GOAL AND OBJECTIVE THAT WE

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.737
WOULD LIKE FEDERAL HELP. IN

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:45.237
GETTING TO I THINK THE

02:00:45.304 --> 02:00:47.640
COMBINATION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:51.243
REGIONAL DOLLARS AND- WHAT WE

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:52.111
CAN BRING TO THAT CAN BE

02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:54.213
HELPFUL. AND I THINK OUR FIRST

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.615
STEP AT LEAST THE FIRST LOOK

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:56.716
INTO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:59.318
REGION. IS HOW WE WILL BE ABLE

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:01.153
TO WORK OFF OF THE COMPLETION

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.622
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:04.657
ON DEL LATER THIS YEAR AND SEE

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:06.392
IF WE I CAN'T START TO WORK ON

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:07.526
THE CONNECTING POINT YOU TO

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:10.329
THAT POP DOWN. A CORRIDOR AND

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:11.597
THERE'S A LAPSE IN AMBITIOUS

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:13.466
LIST RIGHT THERE SO WE DO HAVE

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.534

GOALS IS TO BUILD RIDERSHIP AND

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:40.940
YOUR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:43.442
I'VE SEEN ARE BASED ON THE DUAL

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:44.510
TRACK SYSTEM WITH A CERTAIN

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:45.544
NUMBER OF TRAINS RUNNING SO I'M

JUST WONDERING JUST QUICKLY.

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.581
WITH THE SINGLE TRACK HOW MANY

TRAINS SHOULD BE RUNNING HOW

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:52.885
THAT AFFECTS YOUR- OF. THE

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:53.986
NUMBER OF TREE TO BE RUNNING

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:55.454
PER DAY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:57.056
SPEED OF THIS TRAIN SINCE I'M

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.057
ASSUMING IF IT'S MORE THAN ONE

02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:59.859
TRAIN. TRAINS HAVE TO PULL OVER

02:04:59.925 --> 02:05:01.827
AND STOP. AND IF IT'S JUST

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:03.395
WONDERING THAT WAS RADICALLY

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:05.397
IMPACT THE- THE PROMISE OF WHAT

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:07.399
WAS IT FIFTEEN TRIPS ADAY. OR

02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:09.101
WHATEVER IT WAS HE SAID AND HOW

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:10.236
DOES ALL OF THOSE AHEAD OF

02:05:10.302 --> 02:05:13.939
THOSE OPERATIONAL CHANGES THEN

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.207
CHANGE THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS.

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:18.110
BOB OUR ESTIMATION ON WHAT ON

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:19.945
ONE TRACK WE WILL STILL BE ABLE

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.046
TO MEET EIGHTEEN TRAINS PER

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:23.449
DAY- BECAUSE OF THE-

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:25.618
OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRACKS. FOR

02:05:25.684 --> 02:05:27.019
TRAINS TO. KNOW COOPER PASS

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:28.654
EACH OTHER AT MAINTENANCE AND-

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:31.023
CITING. DISABILITIES WE HAVE A-

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:33.425
LOT OF ANALYSIS ON THIS THAT

02:05:33.492 --> 02:05:35.060
IT. THAT EXPLAINS THAT WE'RE

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:37.062
HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU- IN

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.964
YOUR OFFICE BUT- THERE IS NO

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:41.133
CHANGE IN THE- OUR DAILY TRIPS

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.601
WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT WITH EITHER

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:46.105
ONE OR TWO TRACKS- THERE. IS

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:51.777
SOME IMPACT- MINOR IMPACT ON.

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.012
RIDERSHIP IN THE 2% RANGE

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:55.614
SYSTEM WIDE UP FROM FROM ONE

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:58.884
TRACK TO MANDATE A MINOR IMPACT

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:00.619
ABOUT TWO POINT 2% ON.

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:02.755
ESTIMATED REVENUE UP FROM ONE

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.990
TRACK TO BUT AGAIN WE HAVEN'T

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:08.060
MADE A FINAL DECISION ON ONE.

02:06:08.127 --> 02:06:09.194
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OF THE

02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:11.430
SPEED OF THE TRUCK OF THE TRIPS.

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:13.565
YEAH THEN AGAIN- TRAINS WILL

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:16.902
TRAVEL AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED- IN

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:19.505
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THAT. OF

02:06:19.571 --> 02:06:20.105
THAT SYSTEM TO BE PARTS OF IT

02:06:20.172 --> 02:06:22.741
WERE THEY'LL TRAVEL XPW MILES

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:23.342
AN HOUR AND THEN THEY'LL SLOW

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.777
DOWN TO GET INTO. IN THE

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.779
STATION SO THAT THE SPEED ISSUE

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:29.281
IS AGAIN NOT AFFECTED BY THE

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:32.785
ONE OR TWO BUT TRACK THAT

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:34.586
ISSUE- AFTER STOP AND WAIT FOR

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:37.556
A TRAIN TO GO BY. I KNOW THE

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.725
WAY THAT I THE WAY THAT THE

02:06:39.792 --> 02:06:40.626
SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATIONS WILL

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:43.595
WORK- THE TRAINS UP MOSTLY HAVE

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:44.730
TO SLOW DOWN COMING IN AND OUT

02:06:44.797 --> 02:06:46.865
OF STATIONS- THERE MAY BE

02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:48.634
PASSING ELEMENTS WERE TRAINED.

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:49.969
WILL WAIT FOR THE ONE TO PASS

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:51.837
BEFORE IT PROCEEDS BUT THE WAY

02:06:51.904 --> 02:06:53.072
WE WORK OUT THE OPERATING

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:54.540
ELEMENTS OF THAT AGAIN I CAN

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:57.009
SHARE THE ANALYSIS WITH YOU-

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.344
BUT CHANGE WILL ACTUALLY

02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.345
PROBABLY WANT TO TRAVEL A

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:01.046
LITTLE HIGHER SPEED ON THE-

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.982
SINGLE TRACK OPTION TO MAKE

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:03.515
SURE THAT IT CAN MEET THE

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:05.751
CONNECTING POINTS. ON BOTH ENDS

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:08.087
AND SO. AGAIN I HAVE A FULL

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:09.688

SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO.

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:26.238
AT THIS TIME OUR ANALYSIS IS WE

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:27.573
CAN MEET THE OPERATING

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:29.308

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.654
SINGLE PRACTICE OF PATIENTS THE

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.656
MONEY REQUIRED TO ADD THE

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.824
SECOND TRACK OUT IN TIME. HELLO

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:34.359
BUT THAT COMES AT THE RISK OF

02:10:34.426 --> 02:10:37.329
HAVING TO THE TOTAL COST WHEN

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.764
THEY FINALLY DO IT. BUT AGAIN

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:42.034
THIS IS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.802
CONSERVING MONEY BECAUSE THEY

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.404
DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY

02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:47.839
WOULD WITH BRITNEY AND IN ORDER

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:49.541
TO COMPLETE THE SYSTEM. I DON'T

02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:52.177
KNOW OF ANY ALL HIGH SPEED

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:54.313
RAILROADS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:56.381
THAT OPERATE ON SINGLE TRACK

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.750
ALL THOSE THERE'S ALWAYS A

02:10:58.817 --> 02:10:59.218
RAILROAD EXCEPTION TO

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:01.253
EVERYTHING. THAT HAVING BEEN

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.455
SAID I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:05.357
IDEA OF A SINGLE TRACK

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:08.093
OPERATION IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.861
KIND OF SCHEDULE PLANNING SO

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.363
THAT THE TRAIN STOP IN THE

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:13.198
STATIONS ARE AND PASSAGE OTHER

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:15.000
AND STATIONS OVER AT OTHER

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:17.035
SIGHTINGS. IT COULD WELL HAVE

02:11:17.102 --> 02:11:18.837
AN IMPACT ON THE SCHEDULE THAT

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.472
THEY CAN OPERATE AND I CAN

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:22.174
CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:25.577
RELIABILITY OF THE SCHEDULED.

02:11:25.644 --> 02:11:27.512
TO OPERATE. BUT AS A AS AN

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:30.616
INTERIM MEASURE ALL AS LONG AS

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:32.517
THIS IS PART OF A COMMITMENT TO

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:35.454
COMPLETE THE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:38.223
AS A STEP ALONG THE WAY I DON'T

02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:38.790
HAVE ANY GREAT CONCERN ABOUT

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:42.261
THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:43.695
MISS FRIEDMAN WERE BACK TO YOU

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:45.397
THANK YOU THREE MISTER KELLY

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:47.466
AGAIN PLEASE BE BRIEF A WHY ARE

02:11:47.532 --> 02:11:48.700
YOU NOT LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:51.637
TECHNOLOGIES TO ELECTRIFIED

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:52.237
HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT ARE JUST

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:54.206
AS CLEAN. GIVEN THAT WE'RE A

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:56.942
FEW YEARS AWAY FROM THE STRAIN.

02:11:57.009 --> 02:11:57.876
CARRYING PASSENGERS AND

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.411
CERTAINLY MANY YEARS AWAY FROM

02:11:59.478 --> 02:11:59.878
THE FULL SYSTEM BEING

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:02.514
COMPLETED. SO TECHNOLOGY LIKE

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:04.549
FUEL CELL TRAINS AND OR ANY

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:06.551
OTHER DEVELOPING INNOVATIONS

02:12:06.618 --> 02:12:08.553
ISN'T IT A RESPONSIBLE TO NOT

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.422
CONSIDER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:11.890
AND DO YOU BELIEVETHAT THE

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:15.027
VOTERS DIDN'T INTEND FOR

02:12:15.093 --> 02:12:15.594
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO BE

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:18.497
CONSIDERED. BY HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:20.599
THE BOND BILL THAT THE BOND.

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:21.733
SORRY THE BOND BILL THAT THE

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.236
VOTERS APPROVED- HAS

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:26.071
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS IN IT

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:27.739
IN TERMS OF TRAVEL TIMES IN

02:12:27.806 --> 02:12:29.708
SPEECH THAT WE MUST REACH I

02:12:29.775 --> 02:12:31.710
KNOW OF NO FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:33.512
TRAINING THAT CAN MOVE AT THE

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:35.280
SPEECH THAT WE ARE REQUIRED

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:38.116
UNDER THE BOND BILL TO MOVE.

02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:40.218
AND THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY THAT I

02:12:40.285 --> 02:12:43.922
KNOW OF THAT CAN ACHIEVE THAT

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:44.923
IS ELECTRIFIED STEEL ON STEEL.

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:47.326
GOOD INTO YEARS OUR TIMING SO

02:12:47.392 --> 02:12:47.959
YOU DON'T THINK THAT TWO YEARS

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.828
OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW THE-

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:51.596
FUEL CELL TRAINS THAT NOW

02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.932
OPERATE OF. A LIGHT RAIL FOR

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.267
INSTANCE THAT AS THEY DEVELOP

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:56.501
THOSE AND I KNOW OF SEVERAL

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:57.769
THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT AROUND

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:58.804
THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHO DOES ANY

02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.138
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILLBE

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:02.908
THE PREFERRED TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:03.542
CAN MOVE AS FAST AS ELECTRIFIED

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.777
TRACK. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:07.112
GOING TO BE MOVING IT TWO

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:09.014
HUNDRED PLUS MILES PER HOUR BUT

02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:10.549
THEY MIGHT BE AND WE CAN

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:12.684
CONSIDER. THOSE KIND OF OPTIONS

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.753
I SUPPOSE. IF AND WHEN THAT

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:16.555
MATERIALIZE OKAY BUT WHAT I

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:19.424
KNOW NOW IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:21.460
WE ARE ON NOW IS PROVEN. IT

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:22.861
OPERATES AROUND THE WORLD

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.863
FISSION LEE AND FAST. AND IT

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:27.265
CUTS TRAVEL TIMES MAGNIFICENTLY

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:29.134
GREAT AND IT IS ALSO. JUST I

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:32.003
THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED LET'S

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:32.637
LET'S KEEP GOING WITH THE OTHER

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.439
QUESTIONS- MR FONG HAS MISSILE

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:36.808
WILL COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU.

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:38.677
BUT A DIFFERENCE OF THE JAGS OF

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:40.579
ONE QUESTION AND I'LL- I'LL

02:13:40.645 --> 02:13:42.280
GIVE MY TIME BACK BY A TO THE

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:43.482
L. A. L. IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:45.684
APPROVES- THIS FOUR BILLION

02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:46.885
DOLLAR CORPORATION WHICH WE'RE

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:48.086
EXPECTING WILL COME AT SOME

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.955
POINT WHAT WHAT THE COST OF THE

02:13:50.021 --> 02:13:52.057
DEBT SERVICE B. I JUST

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:54.059
GENERALLY CURIOUS- IF WE

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:59.231
CALCULATED THAT. WE HAVEN'T I

02:13:59.297 --> 02:14:00.332
HAVEN'T DONE A SPECIFIC

02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:02.000
CALCULATION ON THAT ONLY THE

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.268
FOUR BILLION BANK OVER TIME

02:14:03.335 --> 02:14:05.437
USUALLY IN ABOUT DOUBLES THAT

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:06.371
I'M NOT TOO KEEN TO ACCOUNT THE

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:08.140
FACT THAT FUTURE I DOLLARS ARE

02:14:08.206 --> 02:14:09.741
TYPICALLY SERVE OF THE LAST

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:10.776
VALUE THAN. THE CURRENT DOLLARS

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:12.444
BUT BUT USUALLY IT'S SORT OF

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:13.578
WITHIN THAT RANGE OF COURSE

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:14.413
IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON A

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:15.947
VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.549
WHEN THOSE BONDS ARE SOLD IN IT

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.117
BUT WHAT INTEREST RATE.

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.119
CURRENTLY INTEREST RATES ARE-

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:22.754
YOU NEAR HISTORIC LOWS BUT BUT

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:24.356
CERTAINLY AND YOU SAID THAT

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:25.924
WOULD REDUCE THE COSTS AND LIKE

02:14:25.991 --> 02:14:27.959
PROBABLY- COMPARED TO THAT BUT

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:29.461
IT WOULD DEPEND ON IT IF.

02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:31.029
ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY WHEN

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:32.364
THEY'RE SOLD- WHAT WHAT RATE

02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:33.765
THE STATE GETS BACK YES THERE

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:34.866
WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS

02:14:34.933 --> 02:14:40.005
ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING.

02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:41.139
THOSE- DO YOU THE INTEREST. J.

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:43.108
SURVIVE ABOUT- TO SO I BACK-

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:44.476
BECAUSE THERE WAS A- USING.

02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:46.711
COULD BE DONE THAT. USUALLY

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:48.146
THAT'S OF THE ROLE OF THUMB

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:51.883
HOUSING. ROUGH RULE OF THUMB-

02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:53.518
IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THIS OF

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:55.020
THIS- AND THE INTEREST RATES

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.621
ARE AND I HAVEN'T DONE IT I

02:14:56.688 --> 02:14:58.490
SPECIFIC CALCULATION FOR THAT

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:00.826
FOUR POINT. ONE BILLION DOLLARS

02:15:00.892 --> 02:15:01.860
SO I'M HESITANT TO GIVE A

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:03.395
SPECIFIC NUMBER AT THIS POINT

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:06.698
OKAY I'VE UP I'LL GIVE MY TIME

02:15:06.765 --> 02:15:09.000
BY THE CHURCH. THANK YOU ALEJO.

02:15:09.067 --> 02:15:10.469
I HAVE MS FRIEDMAN- THIS MISS

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:13.138
DAVIS HAVE HER. OH I'M SORRY I

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:15.407
MISSED YOU- MS DAVIS. THANK YOU

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:17.676
APPRECIATE IT. MR KELLY DO YOU

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:18.877
THINK THE VOTERS WOULD HAVE

02:15:18.944 --> 02:15:20.979
APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE A FONT

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:22.180
THEY WOULD BEEN TOLD THAT THE

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:23.648
INVESTMENT WAS ONLY ENOUGH TO

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.183
ALMOST BUT NOT TOTALLY COMPLETE

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:27.786
A SINGLE TRACK. SLOWER SPEED

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:28.320
TRAIN SERVICE WITH MINIMUM

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:30.655
STATION CONNECTING TO MERCED

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:34.192
AND BAKERSFIELD. I THINK THE

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:37.796
VOTERS APPROVED PROP ONE A. TO

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:39.164
BUILD IT AND KNOWING BECAUSE

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:42.434
THE- GENERAL. ELECTION VOTER

02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:43.902
PAMPHLET SAID THERE'S NOT

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:46.037
ENOUGH YOUR TO BUILD AT ALL. SO

02:15:46.104 --> 02:15:47.038
I THINK THE VOTERS WOULD HAVE

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:49.207
SAID. BOB WOULD HAVE APPROVED

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:50.375
US MOVING FORWARD ON

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:51.977
ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:54.312
BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA.

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:56.548
AND I IC. RECENT POLLS THAT

02:15:56.615 --> 02:15:58.149
SUGGEST THEY STILL SUPPORTED AT

02:15:58.216 --> 02:16:02.020
ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT. OF THE

02:16:02.087 --> 02:16:02.587
PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL BOND

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:06.157
BILL. IS FRIEDMAN. THANKS I'M

02:16:06.224 --> 02:16:07.058
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO THIS

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:09.461
QUESTION IS FOR- BUT IF CERTAIN

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:10.996
PARTS OF THE PROJECTS AREN'T

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:12.197
MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR LIKE

02:16:12.264 --> 02:16:13.698
THE- TRACKING SYSTEMS

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:15.300
CONTRACTED ANY DEVELOPMENT OF

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:17.168
THE PROJECT BEYOND THE HUNDRED

02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:18.270
NINETEEN MILES. WITH THE

02:16:18.336 --> 02:16:20.005
APPROPRIATION OF THE ADDITIONAL

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.206
FOUR POINT ONE BILLION A

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.874
PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDS NEED TO

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:33.752
BE. NEEDED IN THE- TWENTY

02:16:33.818 --> 02:16:34.352
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO THE

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:35.587
EXTENT THAT DIRECTOR TOWARD ME

02:16:35.654 --> 02:16:39.824
THE ANSWER IS. YES BECAUSE. WE

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:40.425
ADVOCATING THE BILL THE- FOR.

02:16:40.492 --> 02:16:42.961
TO COMPLETE THE COULD. OF THE

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:43.528
HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES YEAH

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:45.697
THE- THE PATIENT WHICH CAP AND

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.766
TRADE DOLLARS. COMMAND WILL

02:16:47.832 --> 02:16:49.000
KEEP PACE WITH THAT

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:50.001
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT'S

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:52.504
WHAT WE NEED. ARE THE BOND BILL

02:16:52.571 --> 02:16:54.839
APPROPRIATION TO COMPLETE. THE

02:16:54.906 --> 02:16:57.042
WORK ON SCHEDULE IN THE CENTER

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:59.277
AND WE HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE- MS

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:00.946
FRIEDMAN TO HAVE A I DO NOT

02:17:01.012 --> 02:17:02.547
QUESTIONS AND ACTUALLY I THINK

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:03.381
THE NEXT PANEL WON'T HAVE AS

02:17:03.448 --> 02:17:04.382
MANY QUESTIONS I WOULD

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:07.986
APPRECIATE. JUST BEING ABLE TO.

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:11.122
ASK THESE. A HOW. WELL I DID

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:11.923
HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE NEW

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:13.391
OPERATING SUBSIDY REQUIRED BY

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:15.527
PROPOSITION ONE ABLE FOR THE L.

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:20.498
A. O. BUT- OF ALL SKIP THAT-

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:21.900
I'M WONDERING HOW HIGH SPEED

02:17:21.967 --> 02:17:23.034
RAIL FITS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:25.804
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SEVENTY

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:26.538
NINE DASH TWENTY IN HIS ORDER

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:28.340
THAT THE STATE TRANSPORTATION

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:30.642
AGENCY AND OTHERS. CHAU

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:32.844
IDENTIFIED NEAR TERM ACTIONS

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:33.745
AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES TO

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.981
IMPROVE. IT IMPROVE CLEAN

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.716
TRANSPORTATION EXCEPT FOR A

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:39.484
WHILE CONTINUING A FIX IT FIRST

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.552
APPROACH TO OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:42.887
SYSTEM SO HOW DOES FIX IT FIRST

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:47.058
FIT IN. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. I

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:48.193
THINK FICTION FIRST IS

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:51.529
CONSISTENT WITH- WELL IF THE

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:52.897
TENANTS THAT CAME OUT OF PASSED

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.733
THE ONE THAT WERE REALLY DRIVEN

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:56.334
AT CRITICALLY ON THE ROAD AND

02:17:56.401 --> 02:17:58.003
HIGHWAY SIDE OF MAKING SURE

02:17:58.069 --> 02:17:59.504
THAT BRIDGES AND ROADS ARE IN

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:02.007
SUCH GOOD CONDITION ASKING. IN

02:18:02.073 --> 02:18:03.808
A WAY THAT STREETS ROADS

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:06.044
HIGHWAYS BRIDGES. ARE VERY

02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:10.448
SAFE- AND IN GOOD STRUCTURAL

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:13.351
CONDITION. I THINK THE OTHER

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:15.687
PART OF THAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:17.555
OFFICE AND REALLY THROUGH

02:18:17.622 --> 02:18:19.157
AGENCY WHO IS DOING THE WORK TO

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:21.860
IMPLEMENT- THE ISSUES AN

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:24.663
EXECUTIVE ORDER ARTICULATING

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:25.330
THE KIND OF PRIORITIES FOR

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:27.132
BROADER CLEAN. I TRANSIT AND

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:29.768
CALIFORNIA TOOLS THEY HAVE TO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:32.103
FORWARD THOSE CLEAN TRANSIT

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:33.905
OPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT I

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:34.606
THINK ASSURING THAT

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:37.008
CONNECTIVITY AMONG THOSE OTHER

02:18:37.075 --> 02:18:38.343
OPERATORS WITH SYSTEMS LIKE

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:42.480
HIGH SPEED RAIL- ARE- COME TO

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:44.282
FRUITION. AND I WOULD EXPECT

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:46.351
THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:47.886
YOU WILL SEE AS THEY COME FORTY

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:49.888
THIRD JULY THANK YOU HAVE A

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:51.723
QUESTION FOR MR THOMPSON THE

02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:52.724
PEER REVIEW GROUP RECOMMENDED

02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:53.992
THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:55.393
AUTHORITY EXECUTE MEMORANDUM OF

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:56.795
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE STATE

02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:58.863
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY HIGH

02:18:58.930 --> 02:18:59.731
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE SAN

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:02.033
JOAQUIN. JOINT HERS OF THIRTY

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.234
BEFORE EXECUTING THE TRACKING

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:05.370
SYSTEMS CONTRACT DO YOU BELIEVE

02:19:05.437 --> 02:19:06.538
THAT MO YOU THAT IT'S BEEN

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:11.342
ENTERED. INTO SATISFIES YOUR

02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:13.111
RECOMMENDATION. WELL I THINK

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:16.247
THE- THANK Y. INTERGENDER I

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:19.017
THINK THE MO YOU IS A STATEMENT

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:20.852
OF INTENTIONS BUT IT IS NOT IN

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:22.120
AGREEMENT AND THERE ARE NO

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:24.756
COMMITMENTS TO LIVE UP TO THOSE

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:27.392
INTENTIONS. BECAUSE OF THE

02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:29.994
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.529
INTERIM SYSTEM THAT THE HIGH

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.832
SPEED RAIL IS PROPOSING.

02:19:33.898 --> 02:19:35.700
BECAUSE THAT IS HIGHLY

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:38.236
DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIONS OF THE

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:40.305
STATE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:42.607
POWERS AUTHORITY AND DAIS- I

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:44.375
THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT THAT

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.344
THAT IN MY VIEW BE CONVERTED

02:19:46.411 --> 02:19:48.313
INTO A MUCH CLEARER SET OF

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:49.748
COMMITMENTS OF WHO'S GOING TO

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:51.282
DO WHAT AND WHERE THE MONEY IS

02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:53.551
COMING. FROM THAN WHAT YOU HAVE

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:54.919
NOW THEN I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:58.022
A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THE-

02:19:58.089 --> 02:20:00.191
THAT THE- INTERIM SYSTEM

02:20:00.258 --> 02:20:01.860
INCLUDING THOSE LINKS COULD BE

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:03.561
MANAGED COULD BE COMPLETED AT

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:05.396
MADDOX. HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN ANY

02:20:05.463 --> 02:20:06.331
THOUGHT AS TO WHETHER A

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:07.499
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.300
CALTRANS AT SOME POINT WOULD BE

02:20:09.367 --> 02:20:12.570
BETTER SUITED TO RUNNING THE

02:20:12.637 --> 02:20:15.240
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. I

02:20:15.306 --> 02:20:17.408
BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL FROM THE

02:20:17.475 --> 02:20:19.577
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY- IN

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:22.180
THE LONG RUN IS TO OPERATE THIS

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:23.915
WINTER BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:25.450
ALL RIGHT THE SHORT TERM I

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:27.252
THINK THE OF SAN JOAQUIN

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:28.720
SERVICES ALREADY BEING PRETTY

02:20:28.787 --> 02:20:30.855
WELL OPERATED AND- AND

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:32.457
EXTENSION OVER THE HIRES PEOPLE

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:35.260
INTO SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD

02:20:35.326 --> 02:20:36.694
BE ABLE TO MANAGE PRETTY WELL.

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:37.829
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THIS MY LAST

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:39.097
QUESTION FOR YOU THAT THERE'S

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:40.331
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:42.167
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. ABOUT

02:20:42.233 --> 02:20:43.468
WHEN SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:44.903
DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE

02:20:44.969 --> 02:20:46.604
BETWEEN YOU AND HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:47.906
AND I'M WONDERING IF I THAT'S A

02:20:47.972 --> 02:20:49.674
CORRECT TAKE AWAY ON MY- ON MY

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:53.344
PART. I DON'T. MEAN BRANDS

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:54.679
SHOULD ALSO ANSWER THIS BUT I

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:56.014
DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S MUCH OF

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.549
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. I

02:20:57.615 --> 02:20:59.350
THINK WE'RE BOTH SAYING THAT.

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:01.753
THAT HAVE THAT THE NECESSARY

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.455
IMMEDIATE TERM ACTIONS ARE TO

02:21:04.522 --> 02:21:06.424
COMPLETE THE FEDERAL COMMITMENT

02:21:06.491 --> 02:21:08.626
FROM THE ERA. OF GRIMMETT THAT

02:21:08.693 --> 02:21:11.596
SHOULD BE DONE. BUT WE HAVE SIX

02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:13.198
MONTHS TO A YEAR TO SEE HOW A

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:14.432
LOT OF THINGS DEVELOPMENT

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:15.867
BEFORE DEVELOP BEFORE

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:17.635
COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THAT AREA

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:20.271
WILL BE NECESSARY. SO YOU KNOW

02:21:20.338 --> 02:21:21.673
TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER ISSUES

02:21:21.739 --> 02:21:23.541
THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO HEDGE

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:25.243
BETS AND SEE HOW THINGS DEVELOP

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:28.079
BEFORE. LONGER TERM COMMITMENTS

02:21:28.146 --> 02:21:29.981
OUTSIDE THE CVS OR RITE I GUESS

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:31.382
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M NOT

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:33.418
CLEAR WHETHER HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:21:33.484 --> 02:21:35.086
SHARES THAT OPINION OR NOT. BUT

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:36.721
WE COULD BE YOU COULD BE RIGHT.

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:38.256
MY LAST QUESTION IS ACTUALLY

02:21:38.323 --> 02:21:40.491
FOR THE L. A. WHICH IS WHETHER

02:21:40.558 --> 02:21:41.726
THE L. A. IS CONSIDERED WHAT

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:42.894
INVESTMENTS IN SHARED MOBILITY

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.262
INFRASTRUCTURE THE SHE SHOULD

02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:46.464
BE MAKING TO REDUCE. THE MOST

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:48.466
AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES. AND

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:49.868
TO ADDRESS CONGESTION AND

02:21:49.934 --> 02:21:51.803
EQUITY ISSUES. AND WHETHER WE

02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:56.941
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH.

02:21:57.008 --> 02:21:57.575
PICTURE OF THE STATE'S MOBILITY

02:21:57.642 --> 02:22:00.712
NEEDS. TO I DON'T WE'VE DONE A

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.580
COUPLE REVIEW OF THAT WOULD-

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:03.882
CERTAIN EIGHT WOULD BE A THING

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.950
GAP AND I EVEN WHAT THE

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:07.185
AUTHORITY DID WHICH WAS LOOKING

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:09.120
REALLY IT JUST YOU KNOW A FEW

02:22:09.187 --> 02:22:10.121
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ALONG THE

02:22:10.188 --> 02:22:11.489
ALIGNMENT WAS WITH A

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:13.358
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.360
SO CERTAINLY LOOKING AT ALL THE

02:22:15.426 --> 02:22:16.895
TRANSPORTATION COST- DIFFERENT

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:17.962
ALTERNATIVES THROUGHOUT THE

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:20.231
STATE WILL BE WITH YOU A LARGER

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:24.135
ENDEAVOR FOR SURE SO- I DON'T

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:24.736

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:49.146
MIGHT. RENO TO FIVE BILLION

02:39:49.212 --> 02:39:51.381
THAT'S IT NEEDED BY TWENTY

02:39:51.448 --> 02:39:52.482
TWENTY FOUR WITHIN THE QUARTER

02:39:52.549 --> 02:39:54.518
IT WOULD BE GREAT MORE THAN A

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:55.819
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:39:55.886 --> 02:40:00.691
JOBS. AS WELL AS- THIRTY THREE

02:40:00.757 --> 02:40:02.893
OF THE PROJECTS THAT COMPRISE.

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.396
ONE DOLLAR NEED- TOTAL HUNDRED

02:40:06.463 --> 02:40:07.431
SEVENTY ONE BILLION AND THOSE

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:09.232
ARE SHOVEL READY TODAY WHICH

02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.901
GOOD GREAT EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED

02:40:10.968 --> 02:40:12.269
JOBS IN THE OR THE TYPES OF

02:40:12.336 --> 02:40:15.539
IMPROVEMENTS TRACK A PATH

02:40:15.605 --> 02:40:17.007
STATION. GREAT CROSSING

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:18.675
IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT SEPARATION

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.243
IMPROVEMENT OF COURSE SOME OF

02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:23.880
THE ROLLING STOCK. THANK YOU-

02:40:23.947 --> 02:40:28.452
AND NOW FOR- IS- MORTENSEN- MY

02:40:28.518 --> 02:40:30.387
QUESTION FOR YOU I HAVE A

02:40:30.454 --> 02:40:34.057
SIMILAR QUESTION WHICH IS-

02:40:34.124 --> 02:40:40.864
BERMAN. YOUR. ABOUT BOOZ

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:43.066
INVESTMENTS IN THE A SYSTEM

02:40:43.133 --> 02:40:45.369
THAT YOU WILL NEED TO CONNECTED

02:40:45.435 --> 02:40:46.436
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TO THE

02:40:46.503 --> 02:40:48.705
CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WHAT

02:40:48.772 --> 02:40:50.440
INVESTMENTS I KNOW YOU DID TALK

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:51.208
A LITTLE ABOUT THIS I WONDER IF

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:52.342
YOU COULD JUST ELABORATE A

02:40:52.409 --> 02:40:53.176
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT INVESTMENTS

02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:55.112
YOU NEED TO CONNECT AND WE'RE

02:40:55.178 --> 02:40:57.314
AT THIS POINT HE BELIEVE THE

02:40:57.381 --> 02:40:59.983
FUNDING IS GOING TO COME FROM.

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:01.651
SO IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW WE

02:41:01.718 --> 02:41:04.087
HAVE ONE POINT THREE BILLION

02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:07.024
OUT OF ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN

02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:09.559
ONE POINT EIGHT. MILLION DATED

02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:11.495
WE DON'T HAVE A FULL ESTIMATE.

02:41:11.561 --> 02:41:13.697
UP WE KNOW HOW TO GET AS TO THE

02:41:13.764 --> 02:41:16.500
MERCED STATION. DEPENDING ON

02:41:16.566 --> 02:41:17.300
WHETHER IT WILL BE A GREAT

02:41:17.367 --> 02:41:19.102
WEATHER WILL BE ELEVATING THAT

02:41:19.169 --> 02:41:21.338
WILL MATTER ON THIS LAST LITTLE

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:23.106
SEGMENT HOW WE TIE INTO IT.

02:41:23.173 --> 02:41:24.107
THEN ADDITIONALLY THE SAN

02:41:24.174 --> 02:41:26.443
JOAQUIN'S NEED TO CONNECT FROM

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:29.746
THEIR SEPARATE LINE ON THE BNSF

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:32.049
ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF. HEART

02:41:32.115 --> 02:41:34.051
WE WILL NEED TO CLOSE THAT GAP

02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:36.620
HOLD THE- SAN JOAQUIN TRAINS

02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:38.522
INTO THAT NEW JOINT HUB IN

02:41:38.588 --> 02:41:41.258
MERCED. AND SO AGAIN WE CAN

02:41:41.324 --> 02:41:43.460
HAVE ESTIMATES IT'S PROBABLY

02:41:43.527 --> 02:41:45.262
CLOSE TO A COUPLE BILLION

02:41:45.328 --> 02:41:47.064
DOLLARS IF IT'S ELEVATED. AND

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:48.432
THEN MUCH LESS SO IF IT'S A

02:41:48.498 --> 02:41:50.233
GREAT SO WE'REWE'RE IN A BIT

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:51.868
OF A WAIT AND SEE PATTERN UNTIL

02:41:51.935 --> 02:41:53.837
WE- CAN GET SOME OPTIONS FOR

02:41:53.904 --> 02:41:55.872
ALL OF THE ENGINEERING. THAT

02:41:55.939 --> 02:41:57.541
MEETS THE MERCED STATION THAT'S

02:41:57.607 --> 02:41:59.076
ULTIMATELY BUILT AND WHAT IS

02:41:59.142 --> 02:42:01.845
THE TIMETABLE FOR THAT WHAT IS

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:02.646
SORT OF YOU'RE ASSUMING YOU

02:42:02.712 --> 02:42:04.381
HAVE THE FUNDING. WHEN COULD

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:05.582
THAT BE BUILT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:07.017
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS REALLY DEPEND

02:42:07.084 --> 02:42:10.520
ON BEING ABLE TO CONNECT TO

02:42:10.587 --> 02:42:11.888
YOUR SYSTEM. AS WELL. WHAT WE

02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:13.590
WOULD HOPE TO PIGGYBACK THAT ON

02:42:13.657 --> 02:42:15.125
THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON THAT

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:17.761
THAT WAY BEFORE. THAT WILL BE

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:20.297
UNDER WAY IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:42:20.363 --> 02:42:20.864
THREE IN TERMS OF ITS FINAL

02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:23.500
DESIGN. AND SO WITH THAT

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:24.935
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO HELP

02:42:25.001 --> 02:42:27.070
THAT CONSTRUCTED. BY THE TIME

02:42:27.137 --> 02:42:28.505
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS OUT

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:29.906
MERCED. SO WHAT ARE YOU

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:31.007
ANTICIPATING IF YOU'RE GONNA

02:42:31.074 --> 02:42:32.242
THROW A YEAR OUT FOR EVERYTHING

02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:33.610
BEING DONE TRAINS RUNNING

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:35.078
PEOPLE ABLE TO GO FROM

02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:37.848
BAKERSFIELD AND GO INTO YOUR

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:41.451
SYSTEM TO GO TO THE BAY AREA.

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:42.652
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE DONE THERE

02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:45.489
BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND

02:42:45.555 --> 02:42:46.957
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND THAT

02:42:47.023 --> 02:42:48.992
ALLOWS FOR ANY LAST MINUTE

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:50.460
CHANGES THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH

02:42:50.527 --> 02:42:52.729
MERCED AT AS PART OF THE HIGH

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:55.065
SPEED RAIL TERMINUS BUT LACKS

02:42:55.132 --> 02:42:56.700
AS HAVE THE BULK OF. OF THE

02:42:56.766 --> 02:42:59.603
APPROACH RIGHT WE GET RIGHT TO

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.671
THE APPROACH THE LAST- TANGENT

02:43:01.738 --> 02:43:03.740
POINT BEFORE WE HAVE TO MOVE

02:43:03.807 --> 02:43:05.142
OFF TO MEET THAT MERCED

02:43:05.208 --> 02:43:07.611
CONNECTION SO I DON'T SEE ANY

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:10.547
PROBLEM WITH TWENTY TWENTY SIX

02:43:10.614 --> 02:43:11.548
TO TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. I KNOW

02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:13.817
MY STEP THAT SHOOTING FOR

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:14.451
TWENTY TWENTY SIX BUT THERE ARE

02:43:14.518 --> 02:43:15.685
SOME EXTERNAL THINGS BEYOND OUR

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:17.954
CONTROL. THANKS AND LAST

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:19.289
QUESTION HIGH SPEED RAILS

02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:20.690
PROPOSINGTO LEASE THE INTER

02:43:20.757 --> 02:43:22.392
REAL SERVICE TO THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:43:22.459 --> 02:43:24.294
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. AND THE

02:43:24.361 --> 02:43:27.197
ALTAMONT CORRIDOR EXPRESS HOW

02:43:27.264 --> 02:43:29.666
WOULD THIS WORK. SO IT WOULD

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:32.035
WORK MUCH LIKE WE'VE LEAST

02:43:32.102 --> 02:43:33.436
TRACK FROM THE FREIGHT

02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:36.106
RAILROADS TODAY. WE LEAVE TRACK

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:36.873
OF THE SAN JOAQUIN WITH THE

02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:39.910
BNSF LEAST TRACK FROM THE UNION

02:43:39.976 --> 02:43:42.179
PACIFIC FOR THE A STRAINS AND

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:44.614
WE NEGOTIATE A AN AGREED UPON

REPLENISHMENT OF THE SYSTEM.

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:53.957
AND SO OUR NATIONAL DISCUSSIONS

02:43:54.024 --> 02:43:54.958
WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:43:55.025 --> 02:43:58.261

ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW OF WHAT

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:10.774
THOSE COSTS WILL BE. AND AS

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:13.476
THEY GO AND SO WE ARE IN

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:15.045

WE'RE TRYING TO DO RE IMAGINING

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.948
THE NETWORKS- I WONDERED IF YOU

02:44:52.015 --> 02:44:53.650
COULD ELABORATE AND EXPAND A

02:44:53.717 --> 02:44:55.652
LITTLE BIT ON ON THE- ESSENTIAL

02:44:55.719 --> 02:44:56.886
NEED THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE

AND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER.

02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:08.665
DOUBLE TRACKING ISSUES ALONG

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:10.300
OUR COASTLINE AS WELL WHAT

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:11.668
WOULD THE TIMELINE RESOURCES

02:45:11.735 --> 02:45:13.069
LOOK LIKE TO REALLY FULLY

02:45:13.136 --> 02:45:16.339
REALIZED- A- RELIABLE HIGH

02:45:16.406 --> 02:45:19.809
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THROUGH THE

02:45:19.876 --> 02:45:21.444
SAN DIEGO REGION. THANK YOU US

QUESTION AND- JUST BRIEFLY. AND

02:45:25.515 --> 02:45:28.251
AS I INDICATED MY PRESENTATION.

02:45:28.318 --> 02:45:29.753
THE LOSS AND CANADA IS THE

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:31.855
SECOND BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY.

02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:32.522
EIGHT MILLION PASSENGERS A

02:45:32.589 --> 02:45:34.591
YEAR. A LOT OF FREIGHT

02:45:34.658 --> 02:45:37.160
MOVEMENT. THAT CARRIED OVER HAS

02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:39.095
SEVERAL CHALLENGES AND ONE OF

02:45:39.162 --> 02:45:43.099
THEM EIGHT WELL ONE POINT SEVEN

02:45:43.166 --> 02:45:44.067
MILEAGES ON THE BLUFF. IN THE

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:46.036
LAST TWO YEARS WE EXPERIENCED

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.504
IN THE ROUGH COLLAPSES THAT WE

02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:48.672
HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY PAY

02:45:48.738 --> 02:45:51.508
ATTENTION TO. EVENTUALLY THAT

02:45:51.574 --> 02:45:54.110
LIFE HAS TO MOVE A LOT. NOT IN

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:56.880
THAT CATEGORY HE ALSO TO BE

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:58.148
STATE AND THEN THE MINIMUM CARE.

02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:00.450
YEAH WE BELIEVE IF WE DO THESE

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:04.287
IMPROVEMENTS THIS CABLE CAN GO

02:46:04.354 --> 02:46:04.854
TO ONE HUNDRED TEN MILES PER

02:46:04.921 --> 02:46:06.856
HOUR SO I KEPT FROM SENTIMENTAL

02:46:06.923 --> 02:46:08.758
TO LOS ANGELES UNION STATION

02:46:08.825 --> 02:46:10.360
WHEN NOT TAKE THREE AND A HALF

02:46:10.427 --> 02:46:11.728
HOURS BUT WILL TAKE LESS THAN

02:46:11.795 --> 02:46:13.530
TWO HOURS. AND THAT IS BUT THEN

02:46:13.596 --> 02:46:14.431
THEN THEDRIVING ON THE I.

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.900
FIVE. THAT WE HADN'T INVESTED

02:46:16.966 --> 02:46:18.068
ABOUT THE BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:46:18.134 --> 02:46:20.403
THIS CASE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX

02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:21.504
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:46:21.571 --> 02:46:22.505
SHOVEL READY PROJECT TO BE

02:46:22.572 --> 02:46:25.075
INVESTED. AND WE HOPE FOR A

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:27.744
FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP

02:46:27.811 --> 02:46:29.512
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND TO

02:46:29.579 --> 02:46:31.114
THE GENTLEMAN'S QUESTION IS

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:33.783
WHEN CAN WE DO IT. IF WE HAVE

02:46:33.850 --> 02:46:34.684
THE MONEY WE CAN STOCK RIGHT

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:36.252
NOW. AN IMPROVING THIS

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:38.488
CHARACTER THAT'S NATIONALLY AND

02:46:38.555 --> 02:46:39.889
STATE WIDE THEN REGIONALLY

02:46:39.956 --> 02:46:42.425
SIGNIFICANT AND I BELIEVE IT IS

02:46:42.492 --> 02:46:44.127
VERY IMPORTANT TO HIGH SPEED

02:46:44.194 --> 02:46:46.062
RAIL WHEN IT'S BUILT IN THE

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:48.398
FUTURE YOU CAN NOT HAVE A HIGH

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:49.399
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT'S

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:55.171
EFFECTIVE. WITHOUT LINKING. THE

02:46:55.238 --> 02:46:55.839
POPULATION CENTERS OF THE STATE.

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:57.307
THANK YOU FOR SO. THANK THANK
