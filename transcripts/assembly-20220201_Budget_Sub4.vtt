01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.088
MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.689
ONCE YOU START TO PULL APART

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.691
THOSE PAID MEDIA PURCHASES AND

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.426
USE THOSE FUNDS FOR OTHER THINGS

PROBABLY HAPPENED A FEW YEARS

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.466
AGO SO I WOULDN'T SEE ANY REASON

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:20.636

TARGETED AT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:42.825
. IT WAS IN TWO LANGUAGES

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.059
ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND I CAN

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.961

FOR EACH OF THOSE BIASES. THE

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.468
MEDIA PURCHASES ITSELF I MEAN

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:55.237
THOSE ARE ELABORATE AND THAT'S

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:57.106
WHY I DON'T HAVE A METHOD AND MY

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.375
FINGERTIPS THEY ARE- PAGES AND

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.343
PAGES LONG SO IT WILL TAKE US A

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.945
FEW DAYS TO PULL THAT TOGETHER

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:03.813
AND TELL YOU EXACTLY WHO THE

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.414

THE TOP THIRD OF HOUSEHOLD

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.691
INCOME. I THINK THAT'S IS VERY

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.026
INTERESTING INFORMATION TO HAVE

01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:18.327
CONSIDERING THE CALIFORNIA IS

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.896
ONE OF THE MORE. DIVERSE US

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:22.932
STATES IN THE NATION AND YOU NOT

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:24.767
ONLY DID. TELEVISION AND LINEAR

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.002
TV BUYS BUT YOU ALSO DID DIGITAL

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.938
AND SOCIAL. WHICH GIVES YOU AN

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:31.173
OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE OUTREACH

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.908
OUTSIDE OF THE TWO LANGUAGES AND

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.677
I'M CURIOUS IF. YOU ONLY STEP A

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.779
PARTICULAR REASON WHY WAS ONLY

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.514
IN TWO LANGUAGES. OR IF THERE'S

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:42.284
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE- FOR

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:44.453
AN EFFORT OF INCREASING THAT

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.189
AUDIENCE BASE. CERTAINLY IT'S

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.290
SOMETHING WE LOOK AT WE'RE WE'RE

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.292
DRIVEN BY EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.195
MARKETING STRATEGY- I THINK IT'S

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:55.197
WORTH NOTING THAT OUR EFFORTS

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:57.132
ARE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON OUT OF

01:08:57.199 --> 01:08:58.167
STATE YEAH WITH THE INTENT TO

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.702
DRIVE INBOUND TRAVEL TO THE

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:01.237
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.438
NET ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:05.708
STATE. WE DIDN'T DO IN AGAIN

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:07.710
DURING PANDEMIC TIMES WE DID DO

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.345
SOME IN STATE ADVERTISING AND

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.145
THAT'S WHERE YOU SAW THE SPANISH

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.982
LANGUAGE MEDIA REALLY COME-

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.250
BECOME IN THAT BEAT BE VERY

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.051
HELPFUL WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.487
KEEP TRAVELERS CALIFORNIANS- TO

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.489
VACATION THEIR BACKYARD FOR TWO

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:22.558
REASONS ONE IT WAS SAFER SAFER

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:25.528
FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK. INTO

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.162
A PREVENTED THE DOLLARS FROM

RETAILERS BUT TALK ABOUT SMALL

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.485
BUSINESS SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.086
BETWEEN WHAT A SMALL BUSINESS IN

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:40.755

INCLUDING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.733
AND THAT'S FROM THE BIG CONCERNS

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.735
WHAT'S L. ELIGIBILITY SO JUST TO

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:57.071
WHOLE MYRIAD OF ISSUES. AND EVEN

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:59.140
THOUGH THE SMASH AND GRAB HAVE

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:04.445
GOTTEN. THE MAJORITY OF THE-

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.846
ATTENTION ATTENTION PICKING

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:09.450
MEASURE ATTENTION- THOSE FOLKS

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.352
HAVE INSURANCE SO WHEN I THINK

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.987
SMALL BIZ LIKE MOM AND POP SHOPS

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.855
A SMALL CORNER MARKET IN A

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.057
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SOMEBODY

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:19.527
WALKS IN THERE AND GRABS UP

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:21.829
HANDS FULL AMPLE THE FOOD OR

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:24.298
ALCOHOL AND WALKS OUT THEY CAN'T

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.900
REPLACE THAT THOSE ONES ARE

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:28.569
TRULY BEING IMPACTED THE MOST.

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.404
YOU KNOW WE WE'VE SEEN FOLKS

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:32.006

OUT A THERE ARE A LOT OF- BALLS

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:43.050
IN THE AIR ON THIS AND REALLY

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:43.718

MONEY'S GOING TOWARDS LOCAL LAW

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:48.189
ENFORCEMENT. BUT THE BIG ISSUE

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:51.792
IS THE LAW IS THE LAW IT HAS NOT

01:33:51.859 --> 01:33:54.328
CHANGED FOR RETAIL ORGANIZED

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:56.130

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:01.168
A LOT OF MONEY AT IT- IF I THINK

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:03.070
TO MAKE EVERYBODY FEEL GOOD BUT

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:04.805

CHARGES PERCY ON SOMEONE TO BE

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:26.827

ARE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:14.426
COSTS FOR THE I HOPE TO PROGRAM

IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL.

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.243
OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT HOW

02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:33.345

HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:37.449
BUSINESSES BE REACHED VERY

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:39.218
SIMILAR TO QUESTIONS THAT WE

02:07:39.284 --> 02:07:41.954
HAVE HAD IN OTHER PANELS AT WHAT

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.923
METRICS AND MEANT AND BENCHMARKS

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:47.426
WILL BE USED TO TRACK SUCCESS.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:51.930
EXCELLENT AND AGAIN TRYING TO-

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:53.098
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WANT

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:54.900
THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINES IS SO

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:58.070
THAT WE CAN DO THAT EXACT KIND

02:07:58.137 --> 02:08:00.506
OF THE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS DATA

02:08:00.572 --> 02:08:02.608
TRACKING. MONITORING AND

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:05.210
EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAMS ABOUT

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:08.414
WE DON'T. FEEL THAT WE CAN

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.582
ENSURE THAT WE ARE HITTING THE

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:13.118
GEOGRAPHIES AND THE UNDERSERVED

02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:14.987
COMMUNITIES THAT WE YOUR DESIRE

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:17.289
TO DO SO WITH THE PROGRAM UNLESS

WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:23.028
THAT WE ARE KEEPING I'M TRYING

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:25.497
READY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:28.300
AND IT IS MEANT TO NOT ONLY

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:30.235
REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT TO

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:32.237
REACH UNDER REPRESENTED AND

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:36.108
UNDERSERVED. COUNTERS AS WELL.

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:38.143
AND AS A FALL UP THE INITIAL AYE

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:40.345
HERB PROGRAM FOCUSED ON INDUSTRY

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:41.613
SECTORS AND WAS INTENDED TO

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.682
BALANCE THE STATE'S EXISTING

02:08:43.749 --> 02:08:44.783
REGIONAL ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT

02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:46.552
FOCUS NOW THAT I HOMES HAVE NO

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:48.387
SPECIFIC INDUSTRY FOCUS HOW WILL

02:08:48.454 --> 02:08:50.622
REGIONAL I HOPE DEMONSTRATE IT

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:51.723
IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING

02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:53.158
ENTREPRENEURS IN EVERY

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:55.661
INNOVATION TECH SECTOR. IF THEY

02:08:55.727 --> 02:08:57.296
ARE ALIGNING WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

02:08:57.362 --> 02:08:58.964
WHAT MAKES HIM A UNIQUE

02:08:59.031 --> 02:09:04.169
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER.

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:05.938
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.339
UNDERSTAND IT THE WE ARE

02:09:07.406 --> 02:09:09.908
ALIGNING WITH OTHER PROGRAMS WE

02:09:09.975 --> 02:09:12.845
ALIGNED WITH THE OTHER PROGRAMS

02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.413
IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THIS STATE

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:17.416
INVESTMENT ACT. I'M I'M I'M NOT

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:19.418
SURE I'M GETTING THE- FULL

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:25.491
CONTEXT OF THAT QUESTION. WELL

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:27.526
IF YOU'RE IT'S IF YOU ARE

02:09:27.593 --> 02:09:28.427
COMBINING EFFORTS WITH OTHER

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:30.362
PROGRAMS WHAT MAKES THE I HOPE

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:36.201
PROGRAM UNIQUE. I'M SO I THINK

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:39.538
THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO THAT

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:43.008
WE ARE THIS WITH ANOTHER WE ARE

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:47.546
NOT WE ARE SIMPLY TO ALIGN OUR

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:50.816
R. SO THE IT WE CAN TAKE

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:53.252
ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:57.022
INVESTMENT AND WE'VE HOPE THAT

02:09:57.089 --> 02:10:01.360

THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT WERE.

02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:11.236
THE WORK THAT DOING IN THIS

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.405
COMMUNITIES OUT WE THINK THAT IT

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:17.042
JUST OFFERS OUR CONSTITUENCY

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:20.179
ACROSS THE STATE A MORE ROBUST

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:23.248
AND PROGRAM. WE DON'T WANT TO I

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:24.883
WAS TRYING TO SAY WE DON'T WANT

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:27.953
TO OPERATE IN A VACUUM I'M STILL

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.655
THE THAT WOULD BE MY INITIAL

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:32.024
RESPONSE TO THAT REGARDING THE

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:35.694
INDUSTRY CLUSTERS WE ARE LOOKING

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:36.461
TO HAVE THE INDUSTRY

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION CLEAN TACK

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:46.672
ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SMALL

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:49.841
BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH WE

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:52.844
ARE LOOKING TO CAPITALIZE AGAIN

02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:54.846
ON AS THEY SAID EARLIER ON

02:10:54.913 --> 02:11:01.253
CALIFORNIA'S. EDGE WE HAVE MORE

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.555
I IN THE STATE WE ATTRACT MORE

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:04.723
CAPITAL AND THE STATE THEN ALL

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:06.491
OF THE OTHER STATES IN THE UNION

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:09.928
. AND WE TO PUT THAT EXPERTISE

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:12.764
TO WORK AND WE NEED TO DRAW ON

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:15.567
TALENT FROM OTHER REGIONS TO

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:18.337
SHORE UP WE'RE WE KNOW THAT WE

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:20.172
HAVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.207
AND WIDELY DISINVEST IT

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:24.643
COMMUNITIES TO GIVE EVERYONE AN

02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:27.246
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

THE BACKLOG THAT THE PORTS AND

CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:54.911
THAT POSSIBLE SUPPORTS THE

02:40:54.978 --> 02:40:56.380
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS

CLEAR INTEREST AND THE REASON

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:03.720
THE STATE IS SO CRUCIAL IS

02:41:03.787 --> 02:41:05.922
BECAUSE- THE MISS CLASSIFICATION

02:41:05.989 --> 02:41:07.424

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:11.094

CONGESTION AND DELAYED FOR YEARS

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:14.998
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THE

FRACTURED NATURE OF THE TRADE

02:41:16.199 --> 02:41:18.201
INDUSTRY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO

SCHEDULE EMPLOYMENT APPOINTMENT

02:41:20.303 --> 02:41:22.205

TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT-

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:26.443

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:49.332
DATA WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IN THE

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:51.001
STATE'S INTEREST. BECAUSE IT

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:52.869
WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO ENFORCE

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:54.838
