I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS FOR ACCOMMODATING OUR REQUEST TO PRESENT AT THIS HEARING DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE ASSET TEST IS A LONG STANDING ISSUE AND MEDICARE POLICY. WHILE MANY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE. BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE ASSET TEST AS A RESULT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE REQUIREMENT REMAINS IF FOR APPROX ME TWO MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. HOWEVER THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE ASSET- TEST THE MAIN ASSET TEST HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. AND MANY OF THE pAND WHAT IS NOT AN ASSET HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED. I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND WE SHOULD BE REVISITING AS IT RESULTS AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. FORCES THEM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR MEDICARE COVERAGE AND ONLY BEING ABLE TO AFFORD HAVE. A RAINY DAY FUND. I'D LIKE TO INVITE MY CO CHAIR DR REGULAR MAKE A AN OPENING STATEMENT STATEMENT IF YOU WOULD LIKE- AND- AND I KNOW THAT- I WAS SUPER THE ANY OTHER MEMBER WILL. ANY OTHER MEMBER ONCE MAKE COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT AS WELL- DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU TO WITH. THANK YOU DR ONE. I'M I'D FIRST LIKE TO START WITH THE THANK YOU DOCTOR WENT FOR- INVITING US TO HOLD THIS AS A JOINT HEARING BETWEEN HEALTH AS WELL AS THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HOLD THESE HEARINGS TOGETHER FOR US TO GET TO THE MEMBERSHIPS ATTENTION ON AN ISSUE THAT IS SO CRITICAL AND PIVOTAL FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD THE DISCUSSION WITHIN BUDGET SOMEONE ABOUT MEDICAL ASSET TESTS AND TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD AB SIX EIGHTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARDIO. ADDRESSING THIS IN A POLICY VEHICLE MY HOPE IS BY HAVING THIS JOINT HEARING TOGETHER TODAY WE CAN SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE TO THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF BOTH BUDGET AND POLICY FOR WHY THIS IS A NECESSARY CHANGE FOR US TO MAKE I WOULD CONCUR THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE CHANGES TO THE FINANCIAL THE ASSET TEST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN WE HAD A- MINIMUM WAGE OF FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS IT'S HARD FOR ME TO THINK THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING ADVANCEMENTS SINCE THEN TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE LOW INCOME. SPECIFICALLY I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND WE'RE STRUGGLING HERE IN THE STATE DURING THIS PANDEMIC OURSELVES AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE RAINY DAY FUND WE WOULD BE IN WORSE ECONOMIC TIMES HAVE YET MANY OF OUR FAMILIES HAVE TO SPEND DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BEFORE THEY THEN QUALIFY FOR THE MEDICAL I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT INCREASING THAT ASSET LIMIT THAT ASSET LIMIT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING. US TO HAVE THIS IS A TWENTY. THANK YOU FOR MUCH TALKED ARAMBULA- WITH ANY OTHER MAY. LIKE TO MAKE ANY COME AT THIS. C. C. NINE- I AM I SAY I HOPE HERE A LITTLE- JUST WANT TO- THE LEE. OF ASSEMBLY CARILLO ON THIS- SHE'S WORKING THIS ISSUE IT'S- SHE HAD A BILL THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT- DOCTOR REGULAR REFERENCE LAST YEAR- AND- I'M WHEN SHE'S HERE I'M SURE SHE'LL HAVE SOME COMMENTS BUT- WE'RE THANKFUL FOR HER WORK ON THAT AND- AND WE HOPE THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE ARE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TOGETHER- AS A BODY. SO I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST SPEAKER- OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS FELICIA Z. SHE'S AN ATTORNEY AND FOUNDING MANAGER PARTNER OF. ATHENA LAW FIRM IN THE AUTHOR OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION PUBLICATION ENTITLED. UNDERSTANDING MEDIC CAL'S ACID TEST FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ASSET TEST REQUIREMENTS. OPTIONS FOR STATE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND GUIDANCE AND WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IN THIS AREA- MIZZI. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON WHAT INTERPERSONAL ARAMBULA- WE HIGHLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY. AS I MENTIONED I'M MANAGING PARTNER OF THE MALL WHICH IS A BIG T. HEALTH CARE LAW FIRM SPECIALIZING IN REPRESENTING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WHAT TODAY'S TEST MONIES GOING TO FOCUS A LOT ON THE B. SEARCH THAT WE DID IN- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHEN WE WERE REQUESTED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION- TO DEVELOP THAT ISSUE PAPER LOOKING AT SORT OF THE- IMPACT OF THE ACID TEST IN SORT OF THE MECHANICS OF THE MASTER TEST. OFFER SCENIC MAJOR CATEGORIES OF SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS A PRECONDITION TO QUALIFY FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT TODAY I TESTIFIED BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF. A THEME ONCE IT'S CLIENTS OR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION. I THINK I HAVE SOME AND I DON'T KNOW IF ARE UP. THEY ARE THEY ARE UP SO JUST Q. AS WHEN YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANCED OKAY. THANK YOU. SO MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AS YOU ALL KNOW YOU'VE BEEN. ON THIS COMMITTEE AS THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM PROVIDES HEALTH COVERAGE TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY WHAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU KIND OF CAN'T THINK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM HAS A FAULT. SO WHAT STRUGGLING WHAT WHEN IT STARTED NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE MEDICAL WAS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES HEALTH SERVICES JUST TO VERY SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF CATEGORICALLY NEEDY INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS UNDER FEDERAL SYSTEMS PROGRAMS. FOR THE AGED BLIND AND DISABLED AND FOR FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN. WHEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. THE PROGRAM CATA LINKED TO MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY SO ONCE YOU BECAME. ELIGIBLE FOR SSI YOU BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. AND THEN OVER TIME CONGRESS HAS CONTINUED TO ADD VARIOUS MANDATORY AND OPTIONAL ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES THE LARGEST OF ONE IS THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE IF EACH OF WHICH IS DESCRIBED SEPARATELY UNDER FEDERAL LAW IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE LAW YOU HAVE A VERY VERY LONG STATUTE. AND WHAT IT DOES IT HAS VARIOUS YOU KNOW SUBDIVISIONS AND EVERY TIME CONGRESS GOES IN AND AN AXE A NEW ELIGIBILITY CALLIE GORY WE JUST SORT OF KEEP ADDING ON- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS THAT WHEN THEY- ADOPT OTHER STATUTES WERE THERE REGULATIONS THEY MAY CROSS REFERENCE JUST ONE OR TWO OF THOSE ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES WE DO REALLY NEED TO THINK OF THEM AS UNIQUE BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN RULES THAT APPLY TO ONE THAT MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL AND SO IT IS BEST INCREMENTAL GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM THAT MAKES MEDICAID POLICY AT TIMES- SOMEWHAT OPAQUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH ALL OF IT. AND DO ALL THE CROSSLINKING. NEXT SLIDE. SO. AS DARK AS AS THE YOUR PERSON WOULD MEND- HISTORICALLY WRONG HAD TWO PEOPLE INCOME ASSETS **** FOR THE PRO. IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CONGRESS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE RULES FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR MANY ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES AND IT AT ELIMINATED THE ASSET TEST FOR THOSE SO NOW LOW INCOME ADULTS AND FAMILIES ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO A TASTE TEST. TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID BASED ON THEIR MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. ALSO KNOWN AS MAD JACK. THE L. CAL FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE JUST WITH. ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE MATCH I'D METHODOLOGY AND SO THOSE CATEGORIES STILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE ASSET TESTS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION ISSUE BRIEF WE FOCUSED ON THE ABOVE LISTED CATEGORIES OF SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE SUBJECT TO AN ACID TEST NO WALK THROUGH THESE REAL QUICKLY TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT HOW HOW EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES ARE DEFINED- THE FIRST CATEGORY LISTED ABOVE REFLECTS THE LINKAGE I MENTIONED BETWEEN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM AN ELEGY TO BILITY FROM VICKI BENEFITS SO AS A CYPRUS. ARE AUTOMATICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. I THIS IS A THAT MANDATE PATH FOR SENIOR FOR SENIORS IN PEOPLE WITH. IT IS AVAILABLE FOR SENIORS WHO ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE GENERALLY RECEIVE INCOME LESS THAN AROUND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE MEDICAID ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR OPTIONAL CATEGORIES OF ELIGIBILITY MEANING THAT STATES MAY OPT TO COVER TOSE INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THOSE ARE LINKS BASED ON- CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME. CRITERIA SO ANOTHER CATEGORY THERE WOULD BE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SSI BUT DON'T RECEIVE CASH EXIST ASSISTANCE. FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR SSI BENEFITS. A THIRD CAR MAJOR OPTIONAL CATEGORY OF ELIGIBILITY IS FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WITH INCOME LESS THAN A 100% OF THE FOUGHT FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE SSI STANDARDS SO THIS CAPTURES MORE OF YOUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ARE BECAUSE IT'S THE CRITERIA IS A LIST LOOSER THAN THE US LINKED CATEGORIES. SO THREE OF THESE THE CATEGORIES OF JUST DISCUSS THE AS A SIDE. THE US I. O. AND THE POVERTY IT SEEMS AND PEOPLE WITH JUST. THOSE ARE ALL THOSE. ARE ALL OF TO THREE MEDIC. NOT WE HAVE THE MEDIC NECESSARY OPTIONAL CATEGORY WHICH IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. DETERMINED TO BE MEDICALLY NEEDY AND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SHERIFF COST MEDIC COW. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE AN INCOME EXCEEDING A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE BUT HAVE HIGH MEDICAL EXPENSES. SO THEY MUST SET SPEND DOWN THEIR INCOMES TO A THRESHOLD SET BY MEDIC HAL AND- BEFORE THEIR MEDICAL BENEFITS CAN. KICK IN FOR ANY GIVEN MONTH. THIS WORKS A BIT LIKE HOW A DEDUCTIBLE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED WORKING IN PRIVATE MARKETS SO IF YOU HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE YOU'RE USED TO HAVING TO PAY YOUR DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE YEAR BEFORE YOUR BUDGET YOUR HEALTH INSURER WILL START PAYING ANY BENEFITS- EXCEPT THAT THIS WORKS IN- ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY I WOULD NEED TO GROUP ALSO INCLUDES MOST INDIVIDUALS CONSIDER WITHIN THE LONG TERM CARE CATEGORY BY THE STATE SO SOME STATES APPLY DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR THE LONG TERM CARE FOR LONG TERM CARE ELIGIBILITY. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MEDICAID PROGRAMS BEAR SO MUCH BURDEN FOR PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE WITH AS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER PAYER I IN THE MARKET BUT IN ADDITION BECAUSE THE COST LONG TERM CARE. TENDS TO BE HIGH INTENDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE A REGULAR WILL SUSTAIN. FOR MANY PEOPLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE LAST CATEGORY IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAM. THE M. S. P. ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES. THIS PROGRAM HELPS PAY FOR SOME OR ALL OF MEDICARE PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE PROGRAM COMPARED TO THE REST. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO AS ALL STAR IS A PULMONARY POINTS- CALIFORNIA HAS IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF THE RESOURCE LIMITS ON INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS FROM THE ASSET LIMIT AND I EXPECT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO SHED FURTHER LIGHT ON THESE- ON THESE EXCLUSIONS BUT IN GENERAL DIFFERENT SENIOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY CATEGORIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT RESOURCE LIMITS. SO FOR THE- SSID LINKS THAT FOR ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS THE RESOURCE WOMAN IS BASED ON THE BILL AT THE RESOURCE LIMIT THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IF YOU ARE PLAYING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME SO IN THAT CASE WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OF RESOURCES THAT YOUR OLD PERMITTED TO KEEP NOT INCLUDING THE EXCLUSIONS THAT ARE PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW AND ORDER OUR CALIFORNIA MEDICAID STATE PLAN ALSO THAT'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE. THE LIMIT FOR THE MET C. PER. WHICH IS SUBJECT TO INCREASES BASED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. CURRENTLY THAT LIMIT WELL TO TWENTY TWENTY THAT LIMIT WAS SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS FOR A AN INDIVIDUAL. AND ELEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE.ALL RIGHT. NEXT SLIDE. AS CHAIR PERSON WOULD HAD MENTIONED THESE THE FOR PARTICULATE FOR THE S. SOCIETY LINKS TO A RESOURCE LIMIT THAT LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR INFLATION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IT HAD BEEN UPDATED SOMEWHAT REGULARLY PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IT'S STARTED TO STAY FLAT SO WHAT THIS IN THIS LIGHT COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION ISSUE PAPER AND WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES IS THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE APPLYING REGULAR ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE CPI TO THOSE LIMITS. AS OF AND THIS IS A THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN- AS A TWENTY NINETEEN INSTEAD OF A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL YOU'D BE LOOKING AT FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN AND FOR A COUPLE YOU'D BE GOING FROM THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ALMOST DOUBLE THAT AT WELL OVER DOUBLE THAT AT SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX SO THERE'S REALLY STARK DIFFERENCE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH INFLATION HAS WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THESE NUMBERS IF THEY HAD CONTINUED. TO BE ADJUSTED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE FEDERAL MEDICAID ACT AND THERE'S A SITE THERE ARE TWO THE PROVISION WILL JUST CALL IT ARE TO DOES A LOT OF STATES USE LESS RESTRICTIVE METHODS THAN THOSE OUTLINED IN FEDERAL LAW TO DETERMINE INCOME AND RESOURCE ELIGIBILITY FOR THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES IN AND IT DOES IT ONLY UP DOES APPLY TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES. OF INDICATE EL ELIGIBLE- IN- BUT AMONG THOSE THREE OF THEM ARE FOR BELOW POVERTY SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY IT NEEDY POPULATION AND ALSO FOR M. S. P. AND ROWLEY'S. THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LESS RESTRICTIVE IS FAIRLY BROAD BASICALLY MEANS THAT BY USING THAT METHODOLOGY- MORE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AND THAT THERE WILL NOT BE OTHERS WHO BECOME INELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF THAT METHODOLOGY. ON AND SO IT REALLY IS INTENDED TO BE WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF AS LESS RESTRICTIVE. SO IT SEEMS HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE STATE- IN AS RECENTLY AS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND FROM WHICH SEEMS LIKE A VERY LONG TIME AGO BUT REALLY IN IN THE HISTORY OF MORE TALK ABOUT MEDICAID THINGS IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO. I AND I SUGGESTED TO STATES THAT THEY MAY CONSIDER THIS FLEXIBILITY TO APPLY LESS RESTRICTIVE ASSET LEAD LIMITS. IN THAT LETTER CMS NOTED THAT ADOPTION OF THESE FLEXIBILITIES MAINLY TO A REDUCTION OF BURDEN ON THE BENEFICIARIES AND FOR STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES. PROMOTE CONTINUITY AND COVERAGE AND CARE. GENERATED MINISTRY OF SAVINGS BY SIMPLIFYING A MOMENT AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. CMS HAD FURTHER NOTED THAT ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI AND NEW YORK HAVE REPORTED AT LEAST SOME ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS FROM ELIMINATING ASSET TESTS AND THAT OBVIOUSLY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEN THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AREN'T SPENDING TIME CONFIRMING. HOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY SOMEBODY MAY HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT OR DOING FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS. UP COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS WHERE AT LEAST I WORK ON SOME OF WHICH THERE CAN BE SENSITIVITY FROM CMS- I AM NOT SEEN IN MY RESEARCH ANY PARTICULAR SENSITIVITIES BICMOS AROUND UTILIZING THE FLEXIBILITY GRANTED IN OUR TO- TO IMPLEMENT A LESS RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO IT'S NOT. ONE OF THOSE HOT. TOPICS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE SEE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE CALIFORNIA HAS EXERCISE SOME OF ITS FLEXIBILITIES- TO APPLY LESS RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY METHODS- AND I'M ASSUMING THAT SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THAT- SO. AND I APOLOGIZE WELL ESTIMATE EMPLOYMENT LESS RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS SIMPLY THREE IS THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS WHICH IS TYPICALLY IN OUR REVIEW HOW WE'VE SEEN THESE- IMPLEMENTED I UNDERSTAND FROM MY REVIEW OF THE DH CS REPORT WHICH WAS ISSUED LAST YEAR THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT CMS HAS ADVISED THAT IF THE STATE SEEKS TO APPLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS WITHIN AN ELIGIBILITY CALGARY FOR EXAMPLE BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE LONG TERM CARE MEDICALLY NEEDY AND OTHER MEDICALLY NIGHT OF NEEDY BENEFICIARIES THE STATE WILL ROCK NEED TO REQUEST A WAIVER OF CERTAIN MEDICAID ACT. REQUIREMENTS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS IS A SUMMARY BASED ON THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION ISSUE PAPER FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ON- WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE APPLIED LESS RESTRICTIVE ABSENT MOMENTS ACTUALLY THAT ISSUE PAPER GOES THROUGH AND DISCUSSES ALL OF THE ASSET LIMITS THAT APPLY IN YOUR. LADIES AMONG VARIOUS. BUT IT IN THERE THEM THAT OF A- LAST ARE RESTRICTIVE ASSET WENT AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE NOT A- SO WE ARE THEIR- ARE KNOW FOR THE SS I. SO I. L. THERE TENS THAT HAVE HIGH LIMITS. FOR THE BELOW PAR US YOU WITH YOU AND PEOPLE ARE JUST- WE'RE SEEING THAT. ERRORS ON HAS NO ASSETS AND STATES HAVE TO A HIGH RESOURCE LIMITS. FOR THE MEDICALLY NEEDY HAVE THE- STATES THAT HAVE HIGHER. LIMITS FOR A- SANDER FOR COUPLES. M. FOR THE M. S. P. PER. WE HAVE A LOT THERE'S A LOT TO BE QUITE A BIT OF LEE. FOR THE M. S. P. PER. YOU HAVE NINE. THAT APPLY NO WAY OUT TAG FOR- IS AT ALL. AND THEN YOU HAVE SOME OTHERS THAT APPLY HIGHER ASSET TAG. MEAN HERE'S PARTY NOTABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN IS AT FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON AND EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COUPLE WHICH IS. MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT CALVET WHERE CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY. LISTED ITS ASSETS. ARE LIMITED- SO WHAT WE DID THEN IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE CUT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION MCCORD WAS LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE AT SOME OF THE ERROR IF SOME OF THE STATE'S. THAT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS OF THESE POLICIES. WITH FOCUS ON ARIZONA BECAUSE IT HAS. A LIMITED THE ACID TEST FOR IS BELOW POVERTY SPD CATEGORY OR- AND ALSO FOR ITS MSP PROGRAM. AND CMS HAD NOTED IN ITS LETTER INTO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE ARIZONA HAD. ITS HAD SEE REAL A MINUTE SAVE. AND THEN WE'LL FOCUS ON YOUR BECAUSE AFTER HELL NEW YORK CASTLE HIGHEST. THE LARGEST MEDICAL PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN REVIEWING ARIZONA'S PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM FROM THEIR MEDICAID STATE PLAN THAT THEY HAD ELIMINATED ASAT TEST FOR MOST CATEGORIES FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE SSI ELIGIBLE AND MS M. S. P. ELIGIBLE. BIG OUT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING LONG TERM CARE AGAIN THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL GIVEN THE COSTS THAT MEDICAID PROGRAMS EXPAND ON LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS. OF PARTICULAR NOTE- WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR REVIEW RESEARCH WAS THE EVIDENCE FROM CMS THAT ARIZONA HAD IMPLEMENTED THE CHANGE AFTER CONTENT DUCTING AN IMPACT STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT ADMINISTRATORS SAVINGS WOULD ROUGHLY EQUAL THE COST OF THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF TAT WOULD BE. GRANTED IF THEY ELIMINATE THOSE ASSET TESTS- I UNDERSTAND FROM THE DH CS REPORT THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN STATE MEDICAID OFFICIALS HAVE CONFIRMED- THAT THEY WERE THAT ARIZONA HAD SEEN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SAVINGS IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE DH CS REPORT HOW WHETHER OR NOT ARIZONA HAD COMPARED THOSE SAVINGS. TO THE INCREASED COST OF BENEFITS. THANK SLIDE PLEASE. SO AGAIN NEW YORK HAS THE SECOND LARGEST PROGRAM AFTER CALIFORNIA IT'S DETERMINE IT HAS ELIMINATED THE ASSET TEST FOR ALL OF ITS A MESS PAEAN ROWLEY'S AND REYES ITS ASSET LIMITS FOR ITS AGE BLIND AND DISABLED BELOW POVERTY ENROLLEES INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LONG TERM CARE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE. AND SO THOSE ARE AGAIN MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY APPLYING- I UNDERSTAND FROM THE DH REPORT THAT NEW YORK LIKE LA ARIZONA HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. AND THEN TO KNOW THE CALIFORNIA LIKE NEW YORK. IT LIKE CALIFORNIA NEW YORK HAS EXCLUDES CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS FROM BEING COUNTED IN THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THEY CAN BE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY DONE WHERE THEY CAN. THEY THEY'VE DECIDED TO EXCLUDE THINGS LIKE CARS THE VALUE OF LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS AND OTHER THINGS FROM BEING COUNTED AS ASSETS. SO THEN NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THEN WHAT WE CONCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION REPORT WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WERE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD AS WELL HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER HOW TO SHAPE FUTURE POLICY AROUND THE ASSET TEST- AND YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S OLD SCALE AND ALL COMES DOWN TO HOW ON EVERYBODY ON THESE COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE ENDS UP WEIGHING THESE DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS BUT- YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS FROM THE CHANGE POLICY WHICH WILL THEN OF COURSE LEAD TO IMPROVE CREASE PROGRAM COSTS. BUT ON THE OTHER YOU HAVE REDUCED ADMIN COSTS WHICH YOU SEE TO HAVE CONFIRMED BY QUITE A FEW OF THE STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS IN THE PAST. YOU CAN OKAY ONE OF THE OPTIONS WITH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION SO IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST IMPLEMENTING R. I. A. N. INCREASE RATHER THAN ELIMINATING ASSET TESTS ALTOGETHER YOU COULD NOT LEAST. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A REASON TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT CAUGHT INCREASED COST OF LIVING YEAR AFTER YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST IS DEAD YOU KNOW TO ALLOW SENIORS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING RIGHT NOW AND I'M TESTIFYING RIGHT NOW I'M- ACTUALLY IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KINGS DISTRICT. YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING HAS GROWN SO HIGH THAT THE IDEA OF. BEING ABLE TO JONES HAVE TWO OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN TERMS OF SAVINGS IS MEAGER. AND SO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THERE TO BE A RETENTION FOR RAINY DAY FUND CAN REALLY MEAN ALL THE DIFFERENCE IF THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED. INCIDENT THAT OCCURS- FOR SOMEBODY WHO A SENIOR PERSON WITH DISABILITY WHO HAS A MEDICAL ROLLINGSTONE. THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER CONSIDERATION. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. IN TO THE OFFICE THAT I. OR NUMBER ONE. THE COMPLETELY. OF AN ASSET TEST. THE INCREASE OF ACID TEST AND- THE INCLUDE EXCLUDE MORE THING FROM SB TREATED AS- UP FOR AS- SOON. PROPOSED AN ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX EIGHTY. AT CREASED S. LIMIT TO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN IN. AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBER. ARE THESE PROPOSALS THE PROPOSAL ANYWAY AND THE BOTH SOME LEGAL SIX EIGHTY THREE AND THAT THE PROPOSED HERE OF EIGHT TEN DOT DOLLAR. HOUSE LIMIT FOR IN FIVE DOLLAR FOR DISH HEALTH MEMBERS THAT SEEMS TO BE THERE IN THAT PUT TO PUT CAL. AS AN OUT COME TO OTHER. ARE FOR EXAMPLE FIRST AND KEEP DON'T ABILITY WITH- IN UNDER THE FEDERAL LINE A SOUTH CAROLINA HAS LIMITS OF SEVENTY FIVE SIXTY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND MORE THAN THOUSAND THREE FORTY FOR A COUPLE. IN ARIZONA PLACE NO LIMITS AT ALL. FOR MEDICALLY NOT NEEDED. I WAS APPLIED SIMILAR TO OF TEN DAHLE DOLLAR IN TWO EIGHT. FOR EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR COUPLE THE NEW YORK AS I JUST MENTIONED APPLIES A HIGHER LIMIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR A COUPLE. FOR MEDICARE'S A SAVINGS PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER MANY STATES APPLY NO LIMITS IMENA MINNESOTA HAVE HIGHER LIMITS THAN WHAT IS BEING CONSIDERED BY CALIFORNIA- AND SO. AGAIN THAT IS AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD BE WELL WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF OTHER STATES IF WE CONSIDERED A PROPOSAL WITH A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR ASSET LIMIT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AND FIVE THOUSAND FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS. THEN THE LAST QUESTION- REALLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD TO CONSPIRACY TO CONSIDER AND PROBABLY GOES HAND IN HAND WITH DISSIDENT CITING HOW TO SHAPE THE ASSET TEST IN THE FUTURE. IS WHETHER WHICH ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES ON THE LEGISLATION WANTS TO PROCEED AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES FOR AND WHETHER TO EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN ELIGIBILITY CRAP CATEGORIES IN THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE THERE IS WHETHER TO EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS. OFF FROM THE ACID TEST IN THAT IS REALLY MOSTLY A FINANCIAL QUESTION OF HOW MUCH MORE OF BENEFITS WOULD NEED TO BE GRANTED IN ORDER TO IT TO INCLUDE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS- OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW WE HAVE SOME SOME OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE COME IN AND THEY THEY'RE GOING TO- I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS IF AND THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IF THAT'S IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU WITH CAN YOU STICK WITH SO LONGER MISSY. OF COURSE OKAY. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS HERE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- ASSISTING ON OKAY YES. AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS NOW AND EACH TIME IT IT STOPS AND DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE OF COST. BUT NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS VERY CLEAR- ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON LEGISLATION THAT IMPACTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THAT IF YOU ARE IF YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING. FOR THE MOST PART CORRECTLY IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE YOU BOUGHT A HOME YOU'RE WAITING TO RETIRE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL FAMILY WEALTH YOU SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BASED ON ANTIQUATED LAWS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOU TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE- AND YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO- HAVE TO SWITCH YOUR YOUR HOME TO SOMEONE ELSE YOU HAVE TO LIQUIDATE ALL YOUR ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS. THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE WANT TO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CREATING POLICIES AND UPDATING POLICIES AT THE END OF THE DAY- ENSURE THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST THIS. IS ANTIQUATED IT IS A POLICY THAT NO LONGER WORKS IT ACTUALLY NEVER HAS AND CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE BEHIND OTHER STATES ACROSS THE NATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OF THE OF THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT CALL CALIFORNIA HOME SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THIS FOR CONVENING- CHEN ARAMBULA AS WELL FOR SOME- YOUR BUDGETS COMMITTEE TERMS OF HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS. HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD ESPECIALLY DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE WE WANT PEOPLE TO STAY HOME. AND YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I KNOW WE HAVE A- AGUILAR. MISS PER GRAMS TANG WENT TO YOU HAVE A- OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. THIS MEETING TODAY- I. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU KNOW MY GOAL LIKE WHAT OTHER LESTER'S. ACETATE BEEN FOR THE- THING IN THE SAFE NET FOR OUR C. AND PER. WITH THE- WHAT ARE THE OTHER TWO CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT OTHER COST SAVINGS I THINK THROUGH THERE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO- STATE FARM. DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THESE F. TAXES WE DID. SO AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR BECAUSE- THIS I'M FORWARD TO FIVE LEARNING TODAY. YOU. AND NOW DO WE HAVE AN SPECIFIC. MISSY MISTER ZERO DID YOU I SEE HERE DO YOU HAVE ANY. YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO POINT. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY SPECIFIC FROM. MISTER DOCTOR. I YOU- FIRST OFF I HEARING ANOTHER ONE WHO CAN REALLY GET INTO THE DETAILS UNTIL ONE TO DO A PRE- WHAT YOU ADDED I WANT TO GET BETTER IF I COULD ABOUT ARIZONA WHICH IS CONDUCT IN IMPACT. THEY WERE ANALYZED BEFORE US WE SEE THAT THE- TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM PURSES THE ELIMINATION OF THE ASSET VERIFICATION THE SAVINGS ARE NOT ROUGHLY EQUAL AND SO I'M WONDERING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS IMPACT STUDY. DID THEY HAVE- WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT THEY PROVIDE FROM THIS IMPACT STUDY WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA TO HAVE AN IMPACT STUDY WOULD IT BETTER ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL COST. THAT COULD BE SAVED. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA WHAT I THINK OCCURRED IN ARIZONA IS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING THEY HAD PERFORMED IN IMPACTS STUDY. ON WHAT I SUSPECT A IN AND THAT IMPACT STUDY DID SHOW THAT THEY HAD ANTICIPATED THE SAVINGS TO EXCEED THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. ARE ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOTED NOTE AND THIS IS ALSO NOTED I THINK IN THE DHS REPORT IS THEY DID EXCLUDE THEIR LONG TERM CARE BENEFICIARIES AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE YOU I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE COST- IT OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE- WHAT I EXPECT HAPPENED AND I THINK THE FOLKS AT THE DEPARTMENT WHO ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THE ARIZONA STATE MEDICAID OFFICIALS CAN CONFIRM. IS MY SUSPICION IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID SEE BEN AND I DID SEE A MINISTRY OF COST SAVINGS. THERE PROBABLY WASN'T QUITE EQUAL SO IT'S PROBABLY THAT THE COST SAVINGS WERE NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OF MINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS BUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE FOLKS AT DHS WHO SPOKE DIRECTLY. TO THE ARIZONA STATE MEDICAID OFFICIALS. IF I COULD I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW ON ONE FINAL POINT WHICH IS. YOUR STATEMENT WAS THE INCREASED COST COMES FROM INCREASED APPLICANTS WHO ARE ON THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SCOPE FOR EACH OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO US AND IT SEEMS THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE ASSET TEST AT LEAST FROM THE DATA WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. IS A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE DHS REPORT AGAIN I DON'T WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO I CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE NUMBERS BUT THEY DO SEEM LIKE THEY- BEGIN AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOR A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY SPEND DOWN TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. AND SO IT'S A QUESTION OF WHEN THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE RATHER RATHER THAN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD EVER BECOME ELIGIBLE SO IT'S A TIMING ISSUE. AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND DOWN THEN THEY'D BE ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF THOSE ASSETS. AND ACHIEVE ELIGIBILITY EARLIER BUT THEN THEY WOULD STILL BE RECEIVING BENEFITS THE WAY THEY WENT LATER ON DOWN THE LINE. FINAL QUESTION IF I COULD IS- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PREDICTED. CASELOAD GROWTH ONE POINT SIX MILLION INDIVIDUALS OVER WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE TODAY. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE- COST COULD BE INCLUDED INTO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY CALCULATED INTO THE ADMINISTRATION'S. MEDIC CAL GOAL. AND US WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING OR THE SAVINGS FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE COST OVERALL IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. SO MY UNDERSTANDING AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENTS PREDICTIONS AS TO AT THE GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM A COUPLE MONTHS AGO FOR SOME OTHER WORK THAT I WAS DOING- ON FIGURING OUT WHAT THE F. MAP WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF THAT IS INTENDED IF THAT IS ANTICIPATED TO COME FROM SOME OF THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND THEREFORE. HAVE LOST EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE I THINK THAT'S LIKELY LARGELY GOING TO BE COMING FROM OTHER CATEGORIES OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WE'RE HERE WORKING BECAUSE THOSE NEWLY ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS WOULD BE A LOT OF THAT SUBJECT BOUNCE BACK AND NOT TO AN ASSET TEST WE'RE HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SO I THINK. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE'RE SEEING THE SAME IMPACT THEIR SOME OF THEM THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE INCREASED EXPENSES DUE TO THE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH HAS AFFECTED OUR ECONOMY AS A WHOLE- BUT- YOU KNOW BASED ON WHAT I LOOKED AT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I ON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD THOSE WOULD BE THE SAME INDIVIDUALS. I WON MY COMP THERE BUT SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THEN BECOME A DISCUSS FOR A AS A LEAD. WHEN OR NOT THE INCLUDE IN THE- SENSE WE DID NOT SEE THOSE PROTECTIONS MATERIALIZE IN THE LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. PRIORITIZE OUR VALUES AS WELL SO WE JUST ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REGULAR AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THE PROJECTED- GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS SIGNIFICANT- YOU MENTIONED LIKE. LIKE IN ARIZONA HE SAID THAT THERE'S AN EXCLUSION FOR LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS CORRECT IS THAT. I THINK THAT'S ON YOUR CHART. THAT'S CORRECT SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS ARE EX. ARE EXCLUDED FROM EXCLUSION FROM A SET TEST SO THEY ARE SUBJECT TO AN ASSET TEST STILL- AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW MEDIC CAL PAID FOR I THINK IT WAS THE LAST TIME I CHECKED WAS WHEN LIKE 90% OF THE LONG TERM CARE IN THE STATE. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHERE THERE'S- IS LONG TERM SYSTEM COST HIGH. BE YOU'RE PAYING RATE. AND THEN IS IT'S WON'T BECAUSE FOR MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL WERE TALKING ABOUT LONG TERM LONG TERM CARE. AND SO THERE WERE PAYING FOR THE THAT SERVICE UNTIL YOU KNOW. THE END OF THEIR LIVES. THE YOU. AND I WOULD AGREE I WENT AS- AGREE STRONGLY WITH THE- DOCTOR AND YOU LIE THIS I THINK THIS A STATE. OF OUR FOR. ARE QUITE FOR. AND I DO WONDER YOU KNOW AS AS PEOPLE ARE HOT ALLOWED TO HAVE LESS AND LESS. OF A RAINY DAY FUND WHAT THAT DOES TO THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. AND WHAT DOES THAT COST US IN THE LONG RUN WHEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW MAKES A DECISION BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY CAN'T BUY WASHER. AND THEY AND THEY HAVE TO WALK YOU KNOW TO A LAUNDROMAT OR WHAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT IF THEY HAVE THEIR EATING. LESS HEALTHY FOODS AND THEN THAT THEY END UP BEING. HAVING MORE- NEEDS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND SO. IT YOU KNOW. I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE'RE REALLY PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH HERE- BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A QUALITY OF LIFE AND- AND IT IS. ALSO DIFFICLT I THINK TO- PUT A PUT A NUMBER OR GET A HANDLE ON. ON WHAT- THE EFFECTS OF LEAVING THIS POLICY IN PLACE IS- BUT IT CAN'T BE POSITIVE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE WHO ARE STUCK HERE AND- IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BE POOR- THESE DAYS- IT'S EVEN HARDER TO- HE TOLD YOU GOTTA SPEND DOWN AND BE POORER. AND CAN'T TAKE CARE OF SOME OF YOUR REALLY BASIC NEEDS SO- SO I- WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS MORE STATEMENT- MR TANG. THE CHAIR BY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD- AND THINGS A DOCTORATE BLOW A JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON DR ARAMBULA QUESTION THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION PERCENT ESTIMATE. CAN YOU US SOME DISPENSED ON WHAT YOU'VE OBSERVED- IN OTHER STATES HOW HOW LONG YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO AND ROLL ONE POINT SIX MILLION. PEOPLE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD TAKE- TAKE QUITE A WHILE POTENTIAL. CHAIRPERSON SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN'T WAS THAT A QUESTION FOR AND- FORMER CHAIRPERSON ARAMBULA. IF YOU DID WOULD TAKE A TIME YES NO AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. THE IT WOULD TAKE A TIME IN PART OF THE IS YOU PRIOR TO PANDA MY- WAS THAT THERE WAS ALREADY DELAYS IN ELIGIBILITY WITH ALL OF THEIR- BE DETERMINATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE ACA SOME OF THAT HAD TAKEN QUITE SOME TIME THERE WAS SOME LITIGATION ABOUT IT- THAT WAS- DETERMINED I THINK OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT LEVEL- JUST LAST YEAR. IS THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS- AND A BIG PART OF THOSE DELAYS IS FIGURING OUT ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO CONFIRM ELIGIBILITY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT IS DETERMINING THE ASSETS. WHO THANK YOU MISSY AND THEN ON IN TERMS OF THE ASSET TEST IS THE ONLY REASON TO HAVE AN ACID TEST JUST TO. KEEP COSTS LOWER WERE THERE ANY OTHER REASON. TO HAVE AN ASSET TEST. WELL I THINK YOU HAVE THE SIDE THIS YOU HAVE IN. WHO HAVE NO INCOME. AND MAY HAVE ON THE DOLLAR AND SAVE AND THAT THAT I THINK IN THEIR SOME. CONCERN ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINS OF THE PROGRAM IT WAS REALLY INTENDED TO ONLY COVER THOSE WHO WERE SORT OF THE NEEDIEST MODE. ALL WITHIN OUR POPULATIONS I THINK THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED A LOT SINCE. ON NUMBER ONE YOU DON'T SEE I DOUBT YOU'RE SEEING MILLIONAIRES APPLIED FOR MEDIC CAL. BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED TO BECOME SORT OF A BROADER SAFETY NET IN AND- YOU KNOW THE YOU'VE SEEN THE POLICY CHANGE. FOR THE FAMILIES AND FOR THE CHILDLESS ADULTS AND TO MOVE TO A MATCH I STANDARD AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS INCOME AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ASSETS. IT'S ONLY FOR THE SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT WE'RE SORT OF STILL LIFE WITH THIS RELIC OF THE RECORDS OF THE PROGRAM. IN IN THE BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER STATES AS OTHER STATES HAVE LIFTED THAT ASSET TASK NUMBER OR GOTTEN RID OF. THE ASSET TEST HAVE YOU SEEN THEM. A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN. ENROLLMENT BECAUSE- FROM THE REPORTS THAT I REVIEW IT LIKE THERE'S- A- NUMBER. BY IT HAS BEEN CRUSHING AMOUNT OF ROOM ANYTHING WHAT WE SEE IN THE DH CS REPORTED IT SIMILAR. THERE WOULD AS WE THAT THERE WOULD A MY NUMBER OF IN THE- WHO WOULD BE. ELLA BUT A LOT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE BECOME ELIGIBLE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER RIGHT I THINK I THINK THAT'S YOUR POINT REALLY WELL TAKEN WHICH IS. THAT WE KNOW- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND- USING YOUR ARBITRARY A DIFFERENT LOOK VERY THAT LEGAL WAYS TO DETERMINE WHO THEY ARE JUST MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET THE ENTITLEMENT THAT WE'VE TRYING TO. GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED SO. ON D. YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE ADVISING US- HOW I GUESS HOW WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF TEST WOULD YOU HAVE WOULD YOU JUST RECOMMEND GETTING RID OF THE ASSET TEST AND TYRA. LET ME SPEAK FIRST TO THE FIRST POINT YOU MADE IS THAT I DO THINK THAT THE WITH THE ASSET TYPES THERE'S A CHILLING EFFECT. AND SO THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT WHO ARE AFRAID TO APPLY TO BE IN BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THE RULES WERE THE RULES ARE VERY COMPLICATED. AND SO THEY THINK THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SO I THINK THAT'S NUMBER ONE IS THAT YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS. COULD QUALIFY EVEN UNDER OUR CURRENT RULES THE BECAUSE OF THIS THAT OF THIS FEAR OR WITH THIS CONCERN OF OPENING THE BOOKS EVERYBODY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO APPLY AND I THINK. THAT IS A GROUP OF FOLKS WHERE BEING ABLE TO MODIFY HOW WE HANDLE THINGS. WE'D ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET THE HELP THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST POINT. THE SECOND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT- I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF. ADMINISTRATIVE IT. DIFFICULTY IN IANS. I IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS TO THE ASSET TEST PROBABLY DOESN'T GET YOU THAT MUCH I MEAN YOU WILL HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE NEEDING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEIR- STUFF. I OLDER INFORMATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY- INCREASING THE ASSET TEST ESPECIALLY FOR WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT MAIN HAS DONE OR NEW YORK IS DONE. THEN YOU'RE LOOKING. AT CERTAIN. MAKING THE RULES A LOT MORE. SO THAT THERE CAN BE A RAINY DAY FUN YOU CREATE A- FOR THE TOO. OVER TO. BASED ON SORT OF INFLATION. AND THE CERTAINLY MAKES IT A MORE HE- POLICY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. AGAIN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AS MUCH IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE CAN YOU GET RID SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. IS WHERE YOU GET RID OF THE ACID TEST ALL ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER. ALL IN THE AREA WHERE I SEE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST IS FOR THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAM. AND FOR A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ASSETS ASKING. A LOT OF THEM ARE IN THE M. S. P. PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE WORK THEY'VE DONE THEIR FORTY QUARTERS OF POOR THING. A THEY'VE GOTTEN ALL OF THEIR- THEY QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE BENEFITS AND SO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST SUPPLEMENTING THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SO THAT'S AN EASY PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET A NOMINATION OF THE ASSET TEST. WITHOUT IT I AND I THINK IT WOULDN'T HAVE NEARLY AS MUCH IT WOULD PROVIDE THE ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. BUT PROBABLY MARTIN MORE MODEST- COST IN TERMS BENEFITS WHAT THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT HAVING INSURANCE IS TO INCREASE THE POOL SO OBVIOUSLY THE MORE PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN THE INSURANCE POOL THE CHEAPER THE COST FOR THE ENTIRE- INSURANCE SO IT SEEMS THATBASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE EVEN IF WE GOT RID OF THE ASSET TEST AND EVEN IF. PEOPLE SLOWLY- WERE ABLE TO COME ONTO THE MEDICAID ROLLS WHICH ACTUALLY WOULD BE A GOAL OF OURS. WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SEE. A COMPLETE- YOU A ONE FOR ONE ADDITION OF COSTS THAT AN THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME COST SAVINGS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS SO WE ACTUALLY DON'T. EXACTLY KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST AND- OBVIOUSLY- AND LAST YEAR IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WE HAD WE HAD SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER. THERE ARE YOU KNOW PRETTY INFLATED COST ESTIMATES SINCE I THINK THIS. I THINK THIS HEARING SEX EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO REALLY. ON SORT OF IDENTIFY. SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- THOUGHTFULNESS AND ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT IF I MIGHT THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING THAT TROOPERS WOULD MENTION IS THAT YOU KNOW. FOR THIS POPULATION THERE'S ALSO THERE'S THE INSURANCE ASPECT THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED AND- IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE MEDICAL POPULATION SENIOR SOME PEOPLE DISABILITIES DO TEND TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW. OF THAT THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC THAT BEING SAID- FOR THIS POPULATION IF THEY WERE BECOME TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR EARLIER. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO. HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN THE END I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAY HAVE RAINY DAY FUND MIGHT IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT WHAT KINDS OF MASKS THEY CAN BUY. WHICH WOULD REALLY BE SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THE THEIR HEALTH IN THE FUTURE WELL WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT ALL IS THE IMPACT OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE YOUR RECORD NEED TO PREVENTIVE CARE THIS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MEDICARE DOES REQUIRE OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. IS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELDERLY OR WITH DISABILITIES AND THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SO THEY WOULD HAVE. ANNUAL CHECKUPS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOU KNOW THEIR IF THE IF THEY HAVE DIABETES TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT UNDER CONTROL SO THAT FROM THE LONG RUN. WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL SAVINGS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT THOSE. ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M THAT THEY'RE UGLY THEY ARE PRIMARY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY IT BUT I THINK THE REAL. AND I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT. AND I THINK IT'S A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES HERE SO- BUT- THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WITH US TODAY. AND WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND TO A SECOND PRESENTER- THANK THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS- KATHY CENTER LING WHO IS NEARLY AT THE NEW LEAGUES OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. ACETYLENE HAS MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. KELLY SHE SAID FROM THE OTHER PART OF THIS- AND SHE'LL DISCUSS THE ON THE GROUND IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSET TEST REQUIREMENTS DURING THE MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY. DETERMINATION RICK- PROCESS SO- MISS CENTER DOING. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WHAT AND CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. ALL RIGHT GREAT THANK YOU. HI HERE I AM NICE TO SEE EVERYONE- IT'S BEEN A WHILE I THINK SINCE WE HAD A HEARING TOGETHER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING YOU TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND PROVIDE SOME COUNTY PERSPECTIVE IN SOME INFORMATION ON HOW THE ASSET TEST IS ADMINISTERED. BY THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES WHO OF COURSE DO THE ACTUAL INITIAL AND ONGOING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL. A COUPLE OF OVERARCHING AND BASIL LITTLE BIT ON OF THE COME. THAT WAS JUST WITH THE SPEAK. ZERO BDA CHEN HAS. MODIFY AND UPDATING OUTRIGHT ELIMINATE THAT HALF TEST WHEREVER. WE DID SUPPORT SB SIX EIGHTY THREE BY FAMILY MEMBER CARILLO VERY NICE TO SEE YOU HERE TODAY. WOMAN MENTIONED THEN THE BRIEFING PAPER IS ALSO NOTED BY THE TEARS IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO RMEMBER BY ATHLETES AND HOW CAL STRUCTURE. IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THAT MANY TODAY AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKER. POST AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT THOSE WERE MOST EFFECTIVE AFFECTED ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN PARTICULAR. THE MAJOR CATEGORIES THAT WERE SHIFTED OUT OF THE ASSET TEST REQUIREMENTS BY THE ACA WERE THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN. REMEMBER CHILDREN LARGELY COULD NOT HAVE ASKED THAT PASSED BY THE TIME WE IMPLEMENTED THE ACA- AND THERE ARE STILL THE LARGEST GROUP OF ENROLLEES IN THE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS ADULTS WITHOUT CHILDREN IN WITHOUT DISABILITIES WHO PREVIOUSLY DID NOT QUALIFY AT ALL FOR MEDIC CAL- AND NOW. ARE IN THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION GROUP. SO M. IF WE WERE TO. THE LIMIT ARE AND JUSTIN ALL TYPES PROPERTY OR ASSETS. OR OUTRIGHT ELIMINATE THE TEST FOR THOSE WHO WE- ANY PERSON APPLYING AS NOTED BY MIZZI STILL NEED TO MEET THE INCOME TAX. WE'RE GOING OF WHATEVER. THEY MAY RETAIN. AT THIS TIME I DID WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE DID GET TO ONE HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THAT WAS AN EXPANSION- REALLY CHAMPION BY THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND AS A REMINDER FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT MEANS THE HOUSEHOLD OF ONE PERSON. FOR THEIR INCOME CAN HAVE UP TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINE DOLLARS SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR AGED BLIND AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THAT'S NOT MATCH AYE. CATEGORY AYE I WILL SAY AS AN ASIDE I THINK THE PERSON WHO HAS A MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. AND NO INCOME AND ALSO NO EXISTING HEALTH COVERAGE AND WANTS TO GET THEIR HEALTHCARE THROUGH MEDICARE ALL IS A BIT OF A UNICORN. SO I DO THINK THAT EXTREME SORT OF EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE ASSET TESTS WERE ELIMINATED. ISRAELI NOT A COMMON OCCURRENCE OF AN OCCURRENCE AT ALL AND SO DISCUSS AN ACID TEST PERHAPS MORE IN ITS MERITS AND WITH THE- DISCUSSION AS YOU WERE NOTING- MISTER- BOTH OF THE CHAIRS- AS WELL AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG- AND THINKING ABOUT SORT OF OUR VALUES AND WHAT IT MEANS TO ELIMINATE THE ASSET TEST. AND ALLOW MORE INDIVIDUALS INTO HEALTH COVERAGE WITHOUT THAT TASK. SEEMS TO BE A REALLY. GOOD FOCUS FOR THE CONVERSATION. THAT STAFF IMPACT INCLINE IMPACT THE HALF TEST FOR THOSE THAT IT DOES STILL APPLY TO ITS- FACETS. OF A DEAL INVOLVED IN. WORK ON THE- OF OUR STAFF. TO CHASE PAPER. ENTERCOM CLIENTS MORE OPTIMAL TO TIMES. THAT HAVE TO CONFUSING. IT NEEDS TO BE X. TO MY APPLICANTS AND RISK. BE THEY'VE NOT BEEN SUBBED TO IT- IF FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WHO BE. PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE THE MATCH I RULES AND HAVE NOW LOST THAT COVERAGE WE DO LOOK TO SEE IF THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE UNDER NON MATCH AYE. AND THAT ENTAILS AS I'LL GET INTO IN THE SECOND. SENDING THEM A BUNCH MORE PAPER AND SAYING PLEASE THESE OUT AND SEND ALL THE VERY. AND THAT CAN BE VERY CONFUSING TO THEM. SO WE DO HAVE A SITUATION AS YOU'LL SEE I THINK IN THE BRIEFING PAPER. AND IT'S A GERMAN NAME ALL OF FROM THE HVS WILL NOTE. WHERE PEOPLE GET THIS. AND THEN THEY JUST NEVER EVEN RESPOND. AND SO THEY DON'T REALLY GET THE CHANCE TO COMPLETE THAT THE SORT OF IDEA FAILING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED AND- WE MAKE THEM- I'M- INELIGIBLE OR POTENTIALLY. MOVE THEM INTO THE COVER CALIFORNIA BASED COVERAGE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE A COST THAT IS GREATER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE. IF WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT ASSET CLASS WITH THEM AND FOUND THEM ELIGIBLE. ON AN. ONGOING BASIS- THERE IS ALSO A TWO EFFECT. FOR THE WHO MAKE. OF EITHER IN THE FIRST PLACE OR- IF THEY ARE FOR EXAMPLE MOVING. MATCH I. COVER ON ARTS. IN ORDER TO SEE IF YOU'RE STILL ELIGIBLE HERE'S SOME PAPERWORK THAT YOU NEED TO FILL OUT AND WE NEED TO GET THESE- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT VERIFICATION. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT EVEN APPLY OR WHO MAY JUST IGNORE ALL THE PAPERWORK. AND THEREFORE MISS OUT ON THIS COVERAGE THAT THEY COULD IN FACT BE ELIGIBLE FOR IF ONLY WE WERE TEN PART PROVIDE THAT. SO IN ADDITION TO THE LIMITS BEING LOW. AND IT APPLYING TO A LOT OF TYPES OF PROPERTY- SUCH AS JEWELRY BURIAL PLOTS TRUSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU ALSO CAN SEE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE THIS DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER. AND SO I THINK YOU SORT OF HAVE TO GROUPS TO THINK ABOUT. THOSE WHO GET TOLD DURING THE PROCESS THAT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE AS. WELL AS THOSE WHO JUST NEVER EVEN START. WELL IF WOMEN NEEDED- AS DISCUSSED I THINK IN THE PREVIOUS. COOPER THERE'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF IN MINUTES. STATE THAT WHEN REALLY BE ACHIEVED IN THE SENSE OF. YOU KNOW WE CAN JUST CUT THE COUNTY STAFF. WHAT WE DO SEE IS THAT COUNTIES ALWAYS HAVE MORE WORK ON THEIR PLATE THEN THEY COULD DO IN ANY GIVEN DAY. SOMEONE'S PHONE CALL DOESN'T GET RETURNED ON THAT SAME DAY. AND INTERCOUNTY TRANSFER MAY NOT BE INITIATED ON THE DAY IN WHICH IS NEEDED. THERE ARE ODD. COVERAGE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ALERTS FROM THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO PROCESS. DEPRIVE MAJOR PEOPLE. MISS OUT ON COVERAGE. NOTHING DO WITH THE- BECAUSE WE CAN GET TO THEM ON THE SAME DAY SO WE WOULD BE. TO MORE. EASILY GET TO THOSE THINGS ANSWER THE PHONE MORE TIMELY CALL BACK THE NEXT PERSON MORE QUICKLY. IF WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHASE THE PAPER FROM INDIVIDUALS. AND EXPLAIN TO THEM. WHAT THESE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS ARE. SO HOW WE CAN PASS THE TEST IS FOR THE APPLE- THE BEING. WHO ARE ARE FOUND IMPLY AND THERE FOUND TO BE AN ISLAND. FOR THE MATCH I BASED COVERAGE IS THE AFFORD CARE ACT COVERAGE. THAT IS BASED ON YOUR TAX FILING. AND NOT AN AFFECT THAT. AT THEIR PHONE IN OUR- FOR. DATE COULD THAT BE TO A- TO THE INCOME BEING OVER THE LIMIT. OR A REASON. THEY- ARE STILL A COUPLE A PATH. IF IT. THROUGH THE COVER TELL. PATHWAY IS WORK VERY MANY PEOPLE APPLY. THEY GO THROUGH THAT. IT WILL. SEND REFERRAL. TO THE- ELIGIBLE STAFF. THAT COULD HAPPEN IF IS A CERTAIN. CHECKED APPLE. ARE AS- HIRE SOMEONE IN MY HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS. OR A CONDITION THAT MAY ME I'LL- UNDER THESE. MATCH I PROBE. ALSO THERE'S A BOX OF THAT APPLE. THAT THEY CAN CHECK THAT. PLEASE RETURN MY- FOR ALL MEDICAL PROGRAMS. THAT'S KINDA NEARLY AND WE LOOK AT PAPER APPLE. THERE'S THIS ONE CENTER HAS BEEN OF CHECKS OUT BOX. THE CAN WILL RECEIVE THEIR APPLE. OF COURSE. TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT AND SO OUT OF THE- AND SO- THAT ME TELL HER SO. BACK THE COUNTY SINCE THE FACT. PASS LIKE MENTIONED THE- IT'S GOT FORMS. THAT TAG. AND I AM FOR. CERTAIN TYPES OF ASSETS TO BE LET'S OUT. AND THEN THE IN- IS TOLD THAT. ARE NEED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS EXAM. ON ANYBODY ACCOUNT- ACCOUNT STATEMENT NEEDED A RECENT ACCOUNT STATE. SO WE CAN SEE HOW OF THE ACCOUNT SO IT GOES FROM THERE AND I CAN ANSWER MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF THERE ARE. THAT THOSE. I'M BEING THERE ARE I. DO TOOK A QUICK REMINDER THERE ARE NON I. FOR WHICH I TEST IS REQUIRED. THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIAL. IN JUST THE MORE. CALL AGE WONDERS. TYPE OF CAR- THEY DO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC CONDITION SUCH AS SOME WITH FRESH OR CERVICAL CANCER. SOME WITH YOUR BOOKING. THESE ARE SMALL PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE MORE SPUR. SO I THINK BOTH. YOU KNOW ON THE FLOOR PROBE- AND THEY INDIVIDUAL AFFECTED DOESN'T SENSE FOR FROM OF THE COPPER. TO THE OTHER REASON THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET- IN. AND WORK. TO FILL OUT THERE- IN. WITH IS IF THEY HAVE. BEEN RE. MY I THINK COVERAGE. AND FOR WHAT REASON THEY'RE NOT LONGER L. THIS MY FIGHT DUE TO IN. THERE INCOME HAS GONE UP AND BEFORE- THIS CAN. THEM FROM THE PROGRAM THE COUNTY IS REQUIRED TO SEND THEM INFORMATION ABOUT MY MATCH ON THAT ACCOUNT. AND SAY WE MAY BE ABLE TO FIND YOU ELIGIBLE IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SITUATIONS AND THAT LISTS OUT THE MOST COMMON NOT MATCH I RELATED SITUATIONS THAT ASKS FOR THAT ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP. SO THE FORM SOMEBODY GETS AND THEY'RE COMING IN BRAND NEW IS AN APPLICATION. OR IF THERE CHANGING FROM MAGIC COVERAGE INTO POTENTIALLY NON MAGIC OR THEN GOING TO GO TO COVER CALIFORNIA. FOR THAT COVERAGE THEY ARE THEY ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE FORMS THAT COUNTIES YEARS DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME THAT THEY STILL ASK FOR PEOPLE TO FILL OUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE UNDER THESE NON. MATCH AYE BATES CORPORATE. ON A FEW DEATHS COM- BEFORE I UP AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION. THAT SACRAMENTO AND I THINK THIS THE MENTION REALLY AND THAT. CAN BE THE TO UNDERSTAND AND WORK A OF FOLLOW UP AND BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE- ALA. WERE AND THE CALL. AND ALL THAT PAPER THERE IS A LOT OF IT AND THEN. IF YOU HAVE THE TYPE OF THAT AND THEN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVE IT FOR THE MOST PART NOT JUST. PEOPLE'S FOR A HERE WE PAPER BACK UP. WHAT THEY SAY ARE THE DOCKING THAT THEY BACK TO US. ON IT COULD BE CONFUSING- AND- WHEN WE WERE WITH OF THE COUNTY PRIOR TO. THIS HEARING TO GET SOME REAL THINGS. HOW DEAL WITH TRUSTS EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE HAS A TRACK ISLAND TRUST LIKE. MY AND I GOT MAYOR WE GOT A WILL FOR KIDS PUT ACROSS TOGETHER- IF REALLY HARD. FOR AN OLD. WORKER AND- THE TRIAL CAN IS AN ASSET WHAT WHAT IF. THEY CAN. CHANGE IT IN SOME. AND THE IT'S TO EXPLAIN THAT I IN A SO OF INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNTIES LIKE IN ALL COUNTY. OR APPLE MANUAL THERE ARE. THEY JUST NEED TO REALLY WORK THROUGH. IN EVEN THOUGH THOSE ARE CALM. SITUATION REVIEW APPLY. WHEN WE RUN INTO LIKE THAT IT DOES TAKE YOU MORE WERE. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT WITHOUT. THIS IS WHAT THE IN THE IS WHAT. THERE ARE FORMS THAT THAT ASK QUESTIONS DIFFERENTLY ENACTED BE CAN BE. FOR TWO OF THEM CALM. USED FORM THAT ASK FOR THAT. ABOUT ONE SAYS. TELL US ABOUT ANY. YOU OWN. THE OTHER. HELLO THANK YOU OR OLD WORN. ONE VEHICLE. AND THAT IF THERE IS YOU. ACT GET HAVE A CAR AND MEDICARE. AND IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE A- CARS TO BE START TO THE- LOOK AT THEIR BACK. IN KIND OF WHAT PURPOSE IS AND WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR. AND SO WE'RE GET. DIFFERENT AND- BACK FROM PEOPLE. ON FOR AND STYLE. THAT NOT BE CONFUSED FOR PEOPLE AS WELL FAR WERE. WHO HAVE TO REMEMBER KIND OF WERE THEY'RE BEING TOLD AND HOW TO. WITH AND THAT THAT PASSED. AND THEN WHAT IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS- AS I NOTED WHEN. TRYING FIGURE OUT OF THEIR- TO BEGIN. OR IF ME THE MATCH I PRO AND GOING. COULD NON MAGIC WORK HELLO. FOR THE END. WALKING AS LONG WERE WORK WITH THEM. SAY THEY SENT PART OF THE IN FOR. BACK SOME OF THE VERY. BASED ON THE TO GET MORE. BEFORE ALLOW FROM. DIFFERENT SUCH. I DON'T HAVE THAT NOW BUT I. FOR IT THINGS LIKE THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN GO AND FORTH FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE THAT IN THE END. IS THAT AS LONG AS WE ARE WORKING. WE NOT GOING TO. CALL OFF THEIR MANAGER BASED COVERAGE WE'RE GONNA WAIT. AND SEE PROCESS THROUGH AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY ALLOWED FOR GO FORWARD WE'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO DENY THAT APPLICATION AS LONG AS WERE ENGAGED WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW THE SITUATION. BUT IT CAN TAKE SOME TIME IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE AROUND THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. DEPENDING ON THE. CIRCUMSTANCE THEY CAN EVEN TAKE LONGER THAN THAT. WITH THAT SORT OF OLD PEOPLE IN LIMBO WHILE GOING BACK AND FORTH THAT WAY. ON AND FINALLY- WE TALK A LITTLE BIT- IN THE PRIOR. ABOUT TERM. AND I DO THINK THAT THE RULES FROM TERM CARE CAN IT'S- CAN. ESPECIALLY BE AS NINA. PEOPLE CAN- DOWN THEIR ASSETS THOSE YOU CAN ARM TAP INTO YOUR BANKING. YOU CAN GIVE SOME OF IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE AN EXTRA CAR THAT. I ALLOW- IF I WASN'T FOR MED ALL I GIVE THAT CARD MY SISTER OR COULD UM YOU KNOW. LET AT AND AT A LOT MAYBE TO GET IT OF MY ASSETS SO I THINK. WELL THE IS A WAY YOU. IF YOU'RE NOT. GOING TO BE GOING IN LONG TERM CARE IF YOU ARE. POTENTIALLY A LONG TERM CARE RECIPIENT AND THAT IS- FOR THE NEXT THIRTY MONTHS THAT'S THREE ZERO THIRTY MONTHS WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE. DID YOU DO ANY OF THAT DID YOU GIVE AWAY SOMETHING DID YOU SELL OR GIVE AWAY PROPERTY OR HOUSE OR SOMETHING FOR LESS THAN IT'S REALLY VALUE THAT. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOME CALCULATIONS AND IT COULD MAKE SOMEONE INELIGIBLE FOR LONG TERM CARE FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THIRTY MONTHS AND IT'S BASED ON. HOW MUCH I GIVE AWAY AND HOW MUCH DOES THE- I CARE COST AND WE DO MATH TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY MONTHS YOU'RE LOCKED OUT- I AGREE THAT LONG TERM CARE THOUGH IS SO PRICEY AND EXPENSIVE. THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO THINK ABOUT- I GETTING TO A POINT IN A LOT OF. WHERE COST WOULD. BE I. SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO BEAR TOOK. A THE TAG THE THIRD. INCREASE AT A MINIMUM FROM WAY WE'VE BEEN FOR THE- SEVERAL BACK- KNOWING THAT IF YOU JUST THINK THE PRINCE. WE BEAT. WHERE WE ARE NOW- IS SOMETHING THAT. CAN SUMMARY. WE HAVE GREATLY SIMPLIFIED ACCOUNT FOR. MANY MANY OF OUR OUR- AND RECIPIENTS. THE AC REQUIRES OF THIS AND HOW. HAD ALREADY GONE FURTHER IN SOME RESPECTS. THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE LAW. BUT THERE ARE KEY GROUPS FOR WHICH THE PROCESS WASN'T SIMPLIFIED EITHER AS MUCH OR AT ALL. AND THEY FOR THE GROUPS ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AND THERE'S NOT A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS IN THE BANK ON FRIDAY I. ADMINISTRATIVE YOU KNOW REDUCE THE OF THE NEED TO DO THESE TASKS. BUT THERE'S A HUGE POTENTIAL. AS EVERYONE. I IN THE PRIOR COMMERCE. FROM KEEPING PEOPLE. MADE THEIR COTTON OF CARE. AND PROVIDING PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND JUST OVERALL GENERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH WHICH IS A REASON TO DO SOMETHING EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A DIRECT SAVINGS OFF AND MANY YOU KNOW POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. POLICY WONK SPEAK RIGHT DOCTOR ON THE LEFT. I THINK THE STATE IS ALSO I JUST WANT TO GIVE THEM A SHOUT OUT THAT THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON ALONG WITH PROVIDERS. AND COUNTIES AND- OF ADVOCATES FOR RECIPIENTS AND THE MOST RECENT ELEVEN FIFTEEN DIVERSE. TRYING TO REALLY EXPLORE AND TEST OUT WAYS TO CARE FOR QUORUM CARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELDER HAVE DISABILITIES OR OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO OVERALL LOWER THE COSTS BUT IMPROVE HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME FOR THEM. AND I THINK- MORE ABOUT IS IN DISCUSSION AND CAL AIM SO I THINK THE CONVERSATION SO THEY- ARE A BIT LINKED IN THAT WAY. ON EVEN THOUGH THE ASSET TEST IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING AT THE VERY FRONT END IS THE GATEKEEPER KIND OF THING. VERSUS PROVIDING THE SERVICES ON THE BACK AND THEY ARE STILL VERY HAND IN HAND BUT THINKING ABOUT IT THAT WAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WITHOUT ALL I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE MAN MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY- ARE QUESTIONS OF THIS SENTIMENT. MISTER CHANG. JUST ONE QUICK I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT DH CS THAT PART OF THIS. ALL SORRY SIR- I. THE KEY. POINTS AND ALSO OF THE REAR TERM WHAT'S IN THE- WILL YOU SEE OF THE- THE- PAST THE- COST ESTIMATES. ESPECIALLY ROOM. OPTION ONE OF THE AYE TEST FOR YOU LOOKS LIKE IT'S A- THIS MADE- INCREASING GENERAL FUND ABOUT HOW AND FIVE DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I'M I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PULL DOWN THE SAME DATA SO WE CAN RECREATE AND REALLY- YOU KNOW SORT OF READ IT MATH. I DO THINK THAT IT'S CALL TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE TWO BY WE WERE LIKE YOUR TALKING ABOUT MISSY THE PERSON ALSO YOU COME IN. AT OUR FOUNDER. THERE'S-% PEOPLE COME IN TODAY AND ARE- pTO PROVIDE AND SO THEY SORT OF GO AWAY THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE I GOT MORE AND SPEND- I DO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME. INTEREST AT THE THROUGH WHO NEVER GET TO THAT POINT AT ALL I'M ESPECIALLY THOSE AS NEW OUTLOOK WHO. MAY BE ON EVEN AFTER BEING A- FOR ITS BY THREE OR BY ADVOCATE THEY SAY NO I'M NOT GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE THAT I THINK WE HAVE THAT PROBABLY. THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM- AND IT FRANKLY MAY SPEAK TO SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING AS MANY CASES OF MEN DURING THE PAN. BUT CERTAIN THIS SORT OF SPECTER OF THIS TO THEIR IF THEY HAVING A SYSTEM FROM THE COUNTY TO COMPLETE THAT INFORMATION COULD BE A BIT OF A CHILLING EFFECT AS WELL SO- I THINK THEY- ON THE NUMBERS COULD. BE GREATER IF YOU TAKE THAT GROUP INTO AN ACCOUNT SO I'M LIKE I SAID I'M NOT ABLE TO RUN A DATA AND- ON MY OWN TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT CHECK OUT. DO YOU HAVE A CELL OF WHO THE BEST PEOPLE TO GIVE US. YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPINION ON THIS NUMBER. WELL I KNOW THAT WE WORKED PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON A LOT OF THE OF THE STUDY SO NOT TO MORE WORK FOR THEM SO I KNOW THAT IS ACTUALLY THEIR JOB IT MAY BE A PLACE TO THINK OF. LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT THAT BOTH BE SUBJECT TO THE ASSET TEST NOW I KIND OF WHAT HAVE TO AS THEY GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND TO THINK ABOUT. HOW MIGHT WE ARE IN- WHAT THE SHOWING UP AS TO HAVE MODEL NOW IS THAT A GROUP OR SMALLER I THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AND IF NOT ABOUT IF THE- THAT IF SOMEONE WERE NEEDS HEALTH COVERAGE AND SOME WHO HAS A THE- SOMEONE WHO IS AS SENIOR WHO HAS FOR AND THERE'S- MAJOR. PUT YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT THEMSELVES TO THAT PROCESS BECAUSE THEY REALLY NEED THAT. AND IT MIGHT BE A GROUP THEN YOU MIGHT GET WITH OTHER OF TO LIKE THIS- BUT I SAW THINK IT DOES WORK BEAR KIND OF LOOKING AND- THANK YOU TO YOU YEAH I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE C. THAT. SOMETIMES IS REALLY FOR THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY MORE IS NOT A MATTER IF IT'S JUST MATTER OF RIGHT SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET A SAID OF REALLY. WHAT IS THE REAL THE IT IS COSTS BECAUSE IF THERE TO BE ON THE AS POINT THEY'RE GOING TO ON THE RULES OF SOME POINT- IT'S- THE PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW WE MAY BE MISSED BUT COULD BE COSTING US QUITE BIT BECAUSE- THEY'RE GOING TO THE ROOM THAN GOING TO- PRIMARY SO AGAIN AGAIN WHAT WE'LL TALK DALY ALL. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE- AS A MEMBER OF THE- THERE. THERE'S TO BE A GROUP OF P. WHO J. IN. THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW THE COVER. THERE TO BE. WITH AND THEY KIND OF AND THAT'S- UTILIZED. ARMORED ROOM OR OTHER- REALLY HIGH AND- WHEN IF WE- HAVE BEEN. THEM AND IF. BARRIER OF THE ASSET TO BEING IN THE- OR CERTAINLY. IF CONSIDER. OF THE WE END. THAT OR DO WE ADD TO THE TYPE OF CASH. THAT ARE EXACT AS MOST. THE WHAT ABOUT I THINK. OF THEM THINGS. WITHOUT OUTRIGHT LIMITING IT- THAT THOSE COULD GET MORE PEOPLE OF AND FOR. GET THEM THAT COVER EARLY. AND THAT'S KIND OF THING THAT I. WE WERE TO DAMAGE. THROUGH LIKE WHOLE PERFECT. IN THE PRIOR ELEVEN. WE THAT NOW AND TELL. THERE WERE. AT HAVE EVEN THEM. CARE PLANS TO ON A LARGER. IN THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JEFF QUESTION. MMHM OKAY I JUST A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OFF YOU I KNOW THAT YOU EARLY ON TALK TO- THE FACT THAT THIS OF THE SAVING- IN IT FROM AT THE COUNTY IS TO JUST YOU KNOW THEY THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO A THAT DO THE PAPERWORK BUT THAT THAT INCREASES THE OF THE SERVICE RIPPED PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE AS WELL THERE IS THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A STRONG TEN VALUE- YOU IN THE- THE- ARE THERE ANY PRINT. DOC REQUIRED THE YOU THINK ARE PART BIRD THE THAT TERM SHOULD BE CHIU OR- OR TO REGISTER TO THROW THE WHOLE OUT. THANK IT'S A GREAT- I THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE COULD BE CHANGE. AND SOME OF THE MORE ARCANE PART OF THE- I MEAN CERTAINLY SAY. FOR THE WHOLE THING OUT I THINK WOULD OUR PRESS FROM FOR MY- PERSPECTIVE. BUT IF THAT'S NOT. OR UP NOW BEING THAT. SORT OF FINAL. THERE ARE A LOTOF THINGS THAT ARE ASKED FOR I MEAN I THINK I MENTIONED THE BURIAL PLOTS IS SORT OF THAT. FOR ME THE HALLMARK EXAMPLE OF WHY ARE WE ASKING SOMEONE ABOUT THEIR BURIAL PLOT I MEAN IT'S JUST. LIKE THEY'RE GONNA GO SELL IT AND THEN PAY FOR COVERAGE FOR IT BUT OTHER EXAMPLES I MEAN. EVERY SINGLE KIND OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IRAS STOCKS BONDS RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. THERE IS- THINGS LIKE. YOU WERE YOU WERE SAYING AND OTHERS WERE SAYING IN THE IN THE CONVERSATION WITH MISSY. THERE IS A NEED ESPECIALLY THE STATE WITH A HIGH HIGH COST OF LIVING WITHOUT. TO BUILD. AND EGG. SOME OF FALL BACK FOR MORE. THANK GO BEYOND JUST HEALTH. THERE ARE ARE A HUGE PART OF LIVING. I KNOW THIS KID THAT MAKE GOD LET'S HOPE IT'S IN A LIFETIME- FOR MOST OF US MIGHT NINETY SIX YEAR OLD MALE ACROSS THE STREET NOT. TO ANALYZE. BUT FOLKS YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO NEED HAVE A I FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN. YOU KNOW PLANNED OF. AND SO HAVING THE LOOK AT. YOU KNOW. WHICH TYPE TO RETIRE ACCOUNT DID YOU GO AND HOW OUR- WORKER. HAVE TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THIS YOU'VE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE BECAUSE NOW I NEED A- YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNT YOU'VE BEEN. INTO THOSE ARE I MEAN ARE KIND OF LIKE A DEATH DECISIONS AND SOME. IF YOUR IF ILL AND YOU KNEW THE COVERAGE I DON'T. THAT IF WE TELL YOU TO. AND THAT'S WHERE PRETTY AWFUL THAT TO SAY THE SOMEBODY THINK IT YOU KNOW SERVE OUT OF THE FIRST. OF THE WORKER. FOR WHOM SOME SAYS BUT THAT'S MY- HOW I. AND WE WHAT WE'RE SEING NOW. OR YOU KNOW SO YOUR BURIAL PLOT OR SELL YOUR- YOU KNOW IF ANY OF THESE THINGS IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY. TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT TRYING TO GET RID OF THOSE TO MASS THAT TEST IF WE CAN'T GET RID OF THE ASSET TEST ALTOGETHER. WOULD BE. HOPEFUL ON MANY LEVELS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. WELL THANK YOU I THINK THE I JUST SIT HERE AND KIND OF SHAKE MY HEAD REGARDING THE BURIAL PLOT YOU KNOW HEAR SOMEONE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN PLANNING AND IT'S A BURDEN FOR THEIR FAMILY NO ONE WANTS TO GO OUT AND DO THAT BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM THEY NEED TO SELL THAT AND CREATE ANOTHER. ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR THEIR FAMILY AT AT A FUTURE DATE MAKE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE SO I'M CURIOUS AND A COUPLE JUST A COUPLE FINAL QUESTIONS HERE. OUR DENIALS FOR EXCEEDING THESE REQUIREMENTS COMMENT OR IS IT MORE COMMON THAT PEOPLE SEE THE PAPERWORK AND SAID I'M NOT TELLING THEM ANYTHING ABOUT THAT- I DO NOT HAVE THE DATA THAT I APOLOGIZE- SO I CAN'T ANSWER SPECIFICALLY. I KNOW WE SEE BOTH. AND AGAIN AS YOUR NOTING I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO PROVIDE. SORT OF THE REASON FOR DENIAL- IS ACTUALLY DUE TO THE ASSETS OR IS IT DUE TO FAILURE TO PROVIDE. I DO- I DO THINK THAT- IT'S MORE BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM OUR COUNTIES JUST ANECDOTALLY. BUT IT IS STILL MORE PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND BEING TOLD NOW- THAN THOSE WHO JUST DROP OUT AND FAILED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME OF. SO WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON REASONS THAT PEOPLE FALL OUT IS IT JUST THEY JUST EXCEED THE NUMBER OR IS IT- I GUESS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE. IT WOULD BE YEAH I MEAN I MEAN THE BANK ACCOUNTS THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND LIMITS ARE FOR BANK ACCOUNTS. AND SO SOMEONE HAD ESPECIALLY I MEAN WE SAW THIS IN THE PROCESS AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND NINE. ALL YEAR WE HAD A REALLY GOOD ECONOMY AND SOME PEOPLE HAD PUT AWAY. EVEN JUST A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCIES AND THEN THEY WERE TOLD YOU HAVE TO SPEND DOWN. THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK SO PEOPLE MAY GO AWAY AND THIS IS WHY SO MANY DO COME BACK WE'LL GO. ALL RIGHT WELL I'LL GO SPEND THAT MONEY. AND INSTEAD OF SAVING AT ALL SPEND IT ON SOMETHING AND- THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THAT THE CHOICE THAT WERE FORCING PEOPLE TO MAKE. WELL WE'RE ALSO DOING. MY ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE THINGS IN LIFE THIS IS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND- SOME AREAS MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN MAYBE. BUT CERTAINLY AREAS OF THE BIKE THE BAY AREA THAT THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR IS IT GOING TO GO VERY FAR. OR OR OR PARTS OF LA OR OR WHATEVER BUT- SO IT'S IT JUST. YOU KNOW I HAVE A HUGE AT THE HUGE DISTASTE FOR ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACHES TO THINGS THAT DON'T. TAKE INTO FACTOR THE REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND- AND I THINK OF I THINK OF SAN FRANCISCO- IS BEING ONE OF THOSE AREAS IT'S- REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE AND- WELL TELL YOU IT JUST DOESN'T GO VERY FAR. AND IT'S- IT FEELS IT FEELS IT FEELS VERY VERY UNFAIR SO. WHAT THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR OUR NEXT SPEAKER- OUR NEXT BECAUSE OUR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- WILL LIGHT BORN IS A DIRECT YOU'RE- A DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AND RENAME ALL I WAS THE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I APPRECIATE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE WORK THAT WAS PUT INTO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. AND THE FISCAL- AND ENROLLMENT ESTIMATES IN THE BACK AND FORTH WITH CMS ON WHAT'S ABLE TO BE PROVIDE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND I THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE TO DISCUSS YOUR REPORT AND- LOOK FORWARD TO- LOOK FOR TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. WELL GOOD MORNING- AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE- DR WOODSTOCK ARAMBULA CHARGING. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I WILL LIKE WILL DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES JOINT FIRING NAME ALL OF OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BENEFITS AN ELIGIBILITY I'M I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE US A BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF HOW. TRY TO FIND- BE OBJECTIVE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL BANK WHICH WAS FIRST PROVIDED ANALYSIS. ON TROUBLE I JUST OR COMMITTEES. ARE FOUR THREE VIABLE OPTIONS ARE. TO INCREASE. OUR ASSET LIMIT ANNUALLY. FOR THE TWO MILLION. ON MATCH- FOR BENEFICIARIES OUR PROGRAM. COURT WHICH WAS LAST JULY ALL INCLUDE ASSESSMENT OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE UNDER WHICH OPTIONS COULD BE PURSUED ALL ESTIMATES WOULD BE INCREASED PRO COSTS WILL BE OPTIONS AND TIME LINES FOR SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY ARM AND- TO COMPLETE THE- R. SALAH REPORT READ MORE INVOLVED YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED WITH CMS OTHERS- AS WITH THE MENTION PREVIOUSLY- BE R. APPROACH IS THE HOUSING USABLE. THE ONLY OTHER OF- INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS THAT MAKE IS THAT- THE- WE THINK OF METACARPALS ONE OF OUR MAJOR PUBLIC BENEFIT FROM. WITH THE BALL OVER THE- DECADES AND I'VE BEEN MORE HELPFUL. FROM A SORT OF A MORE GATEKEEPING CULTURE. CULTURE OF COKE AND SO. REYES ISSUES LIKE THE ONES THAT- ARE. YEAH COMMITTEE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY ALL SO WE VERY WELCOME CONGRESO. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO ALL SMALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH WELL- AND I THINK YOU CAN MAYBE CARE SOME ON VERY HIGH TO BE TODAY. OCTOBER FOR NOW ON OUR WILL THAT WE IN THE SOUTH FOR THAT WAS SUBMITTED THE LEFT. LAST YEAR. I AM A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAS BEEN. WITH THE YEARS. IN TERMS OF HOW ASSETS WORK IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO KNOW- AS HAS BEEN STABLE. WHAT THE ASSET LIMITS ARE IN THE MATTER HOW PROGRAM AGAIN FALLEN INDIVIDUALS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR. THE FOURTEENTH. ALL AS WAS NOTED THESE CHANGES THESE AMOUNTS NOT USE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I'M GOING TO. THE REPORT AND THE FINDINGS AND KIND OF GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW IT WOULD WORK I THINK THAT'S KIND OF BEEN COMMUNICATED THROUGH SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS AND I DO WANT TO NOTE I'M BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE- QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED. THAT ONE WE ARE LOOKING AT- ELIGIBILITY FOR. WELL FIRST LOOK AT WHAT THE ASSETS. AND THEN BASED UPON IF THEY MEET OUR ASSET LIMITS OR NOT. THAT WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF THE FIRST DECIDING FACTORS TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR- IF THEY'RE ABLE TO- MEET WHAT CORE ASSET LIMITS ARE OR SPEND DOWN UNDER OUR ASSET LIMITS. THEN WE WOULD LOOK AT WHAT THEIR ACCOUNTABLE INCOME IS IN TERMS OF DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT MATTER. WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT INCOME THE ONE THING I DO WANT TO NOTE I'M IN THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED-EARLIER BY THE FIRST SPEAKER THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COUNTABLE INCOME BASED ON WHAT THE INCOME LIMITS ARE FOR OUR PROGRAM IN MEDIC COW. IF INDIVIDUALS- YOU KNOW NEED THAT ASSET LIMITS THEY MAY WELL HAVE WHAT WE CALL A SHARE OF COST FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAVE TO SPEND DOWN BASED UPON MAINTENANCE NEEDS LEVELS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN SO INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A SHERIFF COST FROM APPLE. IT'S A MONTHLY AMOUNT THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL MUST EITHER CARE OBLIGATE THEMSELVES TO PAY BEFORE MEDICARE WILL THEN STEP IN TO EVEN NEEDING MEDICAL SERVICES. THAT THE PERSON. I'M ALL FOR IN THE THAT HELLO TO UNDER COST AL IF IN A MONTH THEY NOT ANY TYPE OF MEDICAL IN THE FIRST. THEY ARE THEN ALL. TO MEET SHALL. SO THAT. IS USED ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM. SO I'LL WITH- EARLIER IN TERMS THE SUPPLE REPORT ON THAT WE WERE- REQUIRED CHECK THEN THE HOT-WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE TREATMENT OF ASSETS FOR OUR NON MATCH ON OUR PROGRAM AND MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS. AND FOR LONG TERM CARE. AND REPORT THAT OUTLINED OPTIONS FOR MODIFYING THE TREATMENT OF ASSETS. FOR INCREASING THAT LIMIT ANGLED FOR SOME HEALTH PROGRAMS WHAT THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY IS UNDER THE OPTIONS THAT COULD BE PURSUED AND THEN AS SOON AS FOR THE INCREASE PROGRAM COSTS FOR EACH OPTION. AND THEN WE ESTIMATED TIMELINES. FOR SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. AGAIN FOR PURPOSES OF HOW CAN BE TREATED WHAT IS ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW WE CAN SEEK APPROVAL BEEN WHICH IS FROM WE CANNOT ELIMINATE THE ASSET LET ME. WE CAN'T INCREASE THE ABSENT WHEN WE CAN MODIFY THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ASSET TYPES AND THEN WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT INCREASING ASSETS. ALLMAN AT THE ASSET LIMITS ON AN ANGLE BASIS. ON WHAT WE DID CONSULT WITH C. MASS AND WE HAD ALSO TALK. ON BOTH ARIZONA TEAM WORK. IN TERMS OF THE OPTIONS THAT MEET WHAT LAY OUT IN THE WORKFORCE AND THEN WHAT THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES WORK AND IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH MODIFYING. ASSET LIMITS IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE- WE WALK AT THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR OUR- SAUCE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE THE- COUNTY ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SYSTEMS. THAT USED TO HELP SUPPORT THE WORK OF OUR- PEOPLE. AND AGAIN AS YOU ALL CAN IMAGINE GIVEN THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM- WE DO LEVERAGE OUR ELIGIBILITY AND MOMENT SYSTEMS TO HELP FACILITATE- ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS FOR THE MATTER HOW FAR. AWAY IN THAT SAUCE SYSTEMS THEY DO HAVE THE ELIGIBILITY BUSINESS FALLS FOR- FOR THE NON MAIENSCHEIN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT ANY CHANGES THAT WE WOULD MEET IN TERMS OF HOW ASSETS ARE TREATED IN OUR PROGRAM. THOSE ARE CHANGES WHAT HAVE TO BE- PROGRAMS IN PART AND THE SAUCE SYSTEMS AND AGAIN DUE TO THE MIGRATION TO A SINGLE SAWS ANY CHANGES TO ASSETS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE INFORMED RTG. ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE SYSTEMS ARE SLATED TO BECOME ONE SYSTEM- IN. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. IN TERMS OF WORKING AT THE DAY COLLECTION IT WAS MEANT EARLIER ABOUT HOW WE CAN Y. GET. THE POPULATIONS THAT WERE I. FOR EACH OF THE- WE DID MORE WITH THE SAUCE TO COLLECT DATA ON BENEFITS WHO ARE EITHER NOT OR DISCOUNT. FROM NOW BECAUSE I HAD TO WIN ASK. SO THIS INCLUDING FROM THE ABOUT ME AND MY OF CASH ASSETS. ASSETS THAT WERE OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS AND THE PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY INDIVIDUALS FROM SUPPORT. AND THEN THIS INFORMATION WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE POPULATION SIZE FOR EACH OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. TRY AGAIN IF I THE TRENDS IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WERE OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THE TYPES OF ASSETS THAT COME ONLY PLACES INDIVIDUALS. ASSETS AND- OR IN THE THAT DO HAVE- ASSETS OVER THAT THAT ASSET LIMITS THEY DO HAVE AN ABILITY TO SPEND DOWN ON THOSE LIMITS SO THAT THEY CAN THEN QUALIFY. AND MEET I WORK AT ON ASSETS AND ALL. I'M IN THE CAR PARK. AND THEN THIS WAS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS USED TO THEN DETERMINE THE COST OPTIONS. AND AGAIN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COSTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. THANK TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT OUR POPULATION AND THEN THE COST IN TERMS OF- HOW THE SERVICES ARE PAID. FOR IN THE MEDICAL FROM. RECOGNIZING THAT- ARE SENIORS IN PERSON WITH DISABILITIES. OUR PRIMARY INVOLVED IN MATTER HOW MANAGED CARE TO MEMBERS. SO IN OF THE THREE OPTIONS AND THERE WERE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND ON CELL IN MY GOING OVER THE THREE OPTIONS I HOPE TO COVER MOST OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED TO US AND THEN AT THE END I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FROM SYMPTOMS OF EACH OF THE OPTIONS. AND THEN ALSO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THAT WE COULD MOVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE TREAT ASSETS DEPENDING UPON- YOU KNOW WHERE THE FINAL DETERMINATION ARE- IN TERMS. OF HOW WE TREAT ASSETS IN THE FUTURE. SO AGAIN THE WAY THE REPORT LAID OUT- THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED ARE TRULY NEW ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL COME. PROGRAM EACH OF THE OPTIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. ALL RIGHT I DO ALSO WANT TO CALL OUT THAT THE NUMBERS IN THE CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON A POINT IN TIME SO DEPENDING UPON THE OPTION THAT MAY BE ADVANCED IN CALIFORNIA- INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EITHER PREVIOUSLY DENIED OR THAT DID NOT COMPLETE THE FULL MEDICAL APPLICATION PROCESS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POTENTIAL FUTURE ELIGIBLE MAY BE AND THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN OUR POPULATIONS JUST BASED UPON ASSETS MAY BE TREATED GINGER WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT BACK IMPACTING OUR ASSESSMENT WAS REALLY BASED ON JUST THAT SET UP INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FONG. FROM. THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US. SO IN THE AT OPTION ON ONE THIS IS THE OPTION ELIMINATE THE ASSET TAG. AS INDICATED IN THE REPORT- THIS OPTION I'M HAS EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL FINE- COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. IT IT IS THE OPTION THAT HAS THE ESTIMATED HIGHEST NUMBER OF NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWO. AND AGAIN IN LOOKING AT THIS- THIS- THIS OPTION AND HOW IT WORKS FINE SO IF WE HAVE AN APPLICANT WHO HAD TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. ON THE SECOND WEEK ALL THAT WITH WERE SAYING NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS UNDER OUR RULES TODAY THEY WILL BE IN ELIGIBLE FOR PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR ASSET LIMIT. AND THEN THAT SECOND VEHICLE IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH BACON OVER. OUR ASSETS. SO IF THERE'S MORE INFORMED. THERE WOULD BE NO TASK AND THEN THE END OF THE WITH THE ASSESSED FROM ALPHA ON THEIR ACCOUNT IN. AND THAT IS SOME TO WHAT WE DID. OUR NON MATCH I'VE AYE FARM I'VE- AND AGAIN THOSE ARE BASS ON THE CHANGES THAT WERE DONE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE AND AS WAS STATED EARLIER JUST AS A REMINDER- OUR- MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN OUR PROGRAM. USE OF THAT LAND JOHN HIGH- CAMPBELL INCOME LIMITS FOR THE PROGRAM AND THERE IS NO CONCEPT ONE. WHICH SO IN THE AT OPTION NUMBER TWO. THIS WOULD NEED TO INCREASE THE ASSET LIMITS- AGAIN WE LOOK AT INCREASING ASSET LIMITS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBER AND THEN TO CHANGE THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS SUCH AS NOT COUNTY MULTIPLE VEHICLES. OR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS IN THE ASSET. THESE ARE COMMON ASSETS THAT WE DID SEE WHAT APPLICATIONS AND AGAIN THIS OPTION WAS BASED ON SOME MORE PROVISIONS IN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY THREE OF THAT COMING UP. I THE ESTIMATED TOTAL- FISCAL IMPACT IS NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL SON. AND THEN FOR AGAIN ARE ESTIMATED NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IS. SIXTY NINE SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY. AND AGAIN HAS A SIMILAR EXAMPLE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE THEIR RETIREMENT. ALL HAVE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND RETIREMENT PLAN THAT'S VALUED AT STATE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THE APPLICANT DOES NOT WANT TO DRAW INCOME AT THAT TIME AND ARE NOT REQUIRED TO. DRAW INCOME BASED UPON AYE AT IRS RULES FOR MANDATORY DISTRIBUTIONS. UNDER OUR RULES TODAY THAT APPLICANT WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER THE ASSET LIMIT BECAUSE OF BAD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THAT I CANNOT IN THE RETIREMENT. IF WE WERE EMPLOY THE TO BECAUSE OF RAISING ASSET LIMITS SAID TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- THAT INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT WOULD NO LONGER BE COUNTABLE. AND THEN THE APPLICANT WOULD PASS ONE CAR ASSETS. AND LOOKING AT OPTION NUMBER THREE THIS WAS JUST TO LOOK AT INCREASING ASSET LIMITS AND AGAIN AT TEN THOUSAND FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND THEN FIVE THOUSAND FOR EACH ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBER. AND THAT FISCAL IMPACT IS SEVENTY THREE POINT FIVE MONEY TALKS. ARE THE ESTIMATED NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS OPTION IS FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT. AND AGAIN AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PERSON HAD EIGHT OF FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR SAVINGS ACCOUNT. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE BUT IF WE HAVE OPTION THREE IN PLACE. I BECAUSE OF RAISING THE ASSET LIMITS THEY WOULD PASS THE ASSET. WITHIN OF THE OPTIONS WE DID DETERMINE NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS BASED UPON THOSE THAT WERE DENIED FROM MEDIC COW OR FOR THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS. AS ACT EXCESS ASSETS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS I DID NOT SPEND DOWN ON THE ASSETS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE. ANOTHER AREA THAT WE AT LOOK AT IN THE REPORT WAS AT THE ANNUAL INDEXING OF ASSETS. THIS IS DONE WITH THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAM BUT FOR MEDICAID PROGRAMS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE. SO IN LOOKING AT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS I'M JUST LOOKING AT WHAT CHANGES WHAT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- THE ANNUAL UPDATE USING ONE OUR ASSET LIMITS ARE- WHAT HAVE A HIGH SYSTEM COST BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE WOUL HAVE TO MAKE. TO THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS UPDATE THOSE- IN INDICES ON ANNUAL BASIS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE NEED TO THEN MAKE- TO APPLY THOSE CHANGES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO AS THEY CHANGE THEIR MORE HAVE TO UPDATE AND RE RUN ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS. GOLD ONE WE HAVE INYO FTL UPDATE. ON THAT UPDATE WHEN WE HAVE FAILED CHANGES ARE OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL A FEW MONTHS LATER- WHEN BE EFFECTIVE- NEW OUTBREAKS COME OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THIS DOES WORK OUR COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS TO DO MINE THE TERMINATION.BACK TO THE ACTUAL AFFECTED IMPLEMENTATION DATE I'M OF THOSE CHANGES FOLLOWING THE COMING. AND LOOKING AT CHANGING ASSET LIMITS BASED ON THE- PRICE INDEX. WE'VE ONLY IT WOULD HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON JUST. OF ONE CPI IN. SUFFERED A JEFF LOOKING ONE OUR CURRENT LIMIT IS AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. I WANT SOME- IN. WOULD RESULT IN A ASSET LIMIT TWO AND THIRTY FOUR IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO. SO AGAIN IN LOW AT THAT AND THAT THAT WOULD HAVE IF YOU WOULD A LOW OF IN THIS- WILL IT WOULD HAVE MEANT IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE CALM ELIGIBLE. BECAUSE OF THE VERY SMALL DOLLAR- INFORMATION AGAIN THAT THIS IS BASED UPON THE EXISTING ASSET LIMITS BUT WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW. I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE HOUSING CONS OF WORKING AGUIAR-CURRY- OPTIONS. THAT WERE LAID OUT IN THE CAPE FOR. I SOMEONE LOOKING AT- HELLO THE ASSETS. AGAIN IN TERMS OF OUR- HELLO IT DOES ALIGN WITH MAN TIME METHODOLOGIES THIS HAS BEEN STATED. IT DOES SIMPLIFY PROCESS FOR- INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS AND IT DOES EASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON. THERE ARE FALSE BETTER ASSOCIATED WITH IT- AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WAIT THEY CHANGES IN ASSETS WENT BACK MIGHT DO- FONG INDIVIDUALS NOW YOU KNOW COMING INTO THE PROGRAM I'M SO YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE FOUND TO BE ELIGIBLE. AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BEYOND THE ESTIMATES THAT WE CAN. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT OPTION NUMBER TWO WHERE WE INCREASED THE ASSET LIMIT CAN ONE CHANGE THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS. IT DOES HELP US TO BE MORE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CURRENT COST OF LIVING BY INCREASING ASSET LIMITS FOR NON MATCH I PROGRAMS AND IT DOES PROVIDE SOME MORE GLOBAL MOVIE FOR INDIVIDUALS ARE RELATED TO. ASSETS WHEN IT DOES A LINE WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN- LAID OUT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY. ONE AND THEN AGAIN- IN TERMS OF A CON YOU KNOW STILL DEALING WITH- BETTER TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ASSETS IS COMPLEX THERE COULD BE SOME INITIAL- INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS- OF THE ASSETS WHERE THERE COULD BE SOME INCORRECT ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AS OUR CAMERAS ARE BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW POLICIES BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR CARS YOU KNOW THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN WE HAVE NEW POLICY CHANGES OR FROM WHAT WE DO FORCE CORRECT. AND IN TERMS OF JUST OPTION THREE LOOKING BACK INCREASE THE ASSET LIMITS AGAIN. WILL BE A BETTER ALIGNMENT WITH CURRENT COST OF LIVING FOR INCREASING ASSET LIMITS OR BOTH ARE NOT MAIENSCHEIN AND I'M LIKE SAVINGS. IT IS THE LEAST COSTLY OF THE THREE OPTIONS AND THEREFORE IN MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE DEADLINE FOR BEING OVER A FAST SUPPLEMENTS I'M IT COULD- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR OUR- THERE ARE STILL IN TERMS OF A CON THERE ARE STILL MANY TO A SENSE FOR AVAILABLE ASSETS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND TO DETERMINE WHAT IS OR IS NOT AVAILABLE. WHEN MAKING. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. THE LAST THING I DO WANT TO TALK ON IS. ON IN LOOKING AT DISK WITH OUR FEDERAL COURT. IN TERMS OF WHY THIS FEDERAL FROM SO ALL OF THE OPTIONS OBVIOUSLY. FROM WE CAN MAKE THE CHANGE THROUGH- SAFE AND THEN HOWEVER IF WE WANTED TO A WOMEN THE LONG TERM CARE POPULATION- FOR IN OF THESE. AND WE HAVE TO FILE A FEDERAL WAIVER DUE TO PROFITABILITY BECAUSE WE CANNOT TREAT POPULATIONS THAT FALL WITHIN THE SAME COVERAGE BURKE WE CANNOT TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY SO IF THERE WAS A DESIRE TO LOOK AT THE TREATMENT OF ASSETS BOB FOR PEOPLE THAT. MAY BE ON TERM CARE. I THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK A FEDERAL WAIVER OUT FOR MAKING CHANGE. SO AT THIS I LIKE TO STOCK IN THEN WELL ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- QUESTIONS. MR TANG A QUICK QUICK QUESTION COULD YOU WALK THROUGH HOW YOU GOT TO THE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. SO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WE FIRST LOOK AT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR COVERAGE. AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE ELIGIBLE AND THEN FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR COVERAGE. OUT ONE OVER THE ASSET AMOUNTS BUT HAD SUBSEQUENTLY COME BACK AND HAD SPENT DOWN TO THOSE ASSETS AND THEN BECAME ELIGIBLE IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS. IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAME UP WITH A NET NEW ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS OUT FOR THAT- GOT HE DID DID DID DETERMINE PEOPLE WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME ELIGIBLE AND YOU TOOK THE DIFFERENCE THAT. THAT'S THE ONLY TWO THOUSAND MINUS THE FOUR SIX HUNDRED OR SO. OKAY THANK YOU. YOUR THANK YOU OTHERS AFTER REGULAR THANK YOU AND- DIRECTOR LAKEPORT IT'S NICE TALKING TO YOU TWO DAYS IN A ROW INTO DO NOTICE THAT YOU WERE SHORT ON WORDS TODAY BUT DO WANTS TO ACTUALLY- ABOUT YOUR- CHOICE ARCHITECTURE AND I'M SORRY TO GET WONKY AGAIN BUT- THE IDEA THAT WHEN YOU pBENEFIT FROM ONE OF GATE KEEPING TO ONE. OF COVERAGE IT'S A CHANGE IN MENTALITY AS WELL. SO WANTED TO ASK YOU IF I COULD ABOUT THE C. W. D. A.'S COMMENTS THAT THE ACID TEST HAS A CHILLING EFFECT. INSIDE I THINK THE OPPOSITE OF THAT THEN IS TO QUESTION WHETHER REMOVING THE ASSET TEST MAKES US A WARMER AND MORE COMPASSIONATE STATE. AND MOVES US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AS WE LOOK DURING THIS PANDEMIC I HOPE WE ALSO SEE THAT THE HEALTH OF EACH OF US IS DEPENDENT ON THE HEALTH OF ALL OF US. AND THAT WAS OUR ELDERLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHO BORE THE BRUNT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD HELP TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO MOVE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BY INCLUDING THIS CONVERSATION. I WILL ADD IT AS WELL HAVING BEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ONE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR EMERGENCY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND LOOKING AT THESE ASSETS LIMITS OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT WE REALLY ARE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT IS PLACING STRESS ON TO OUR COMMUNITIES. FINAL AND THIS IS JUST THE REAL QUESTION IT SEEMED AS IF C. W. D. A. WAS SAYING THAT THE PURPOSE OF CATALAN WHOLE PERSON CARES WAS TO MOVE. IN A DIRECTION THAT WAS MORE PREVENTATIVE TO MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT INCREASED CONTINUITY OF CARE AND IT SEEMS THAT BY REMOVING THE ASSET TEST WE WOULD INCREASE CONTINUITY OF CARE. AND MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S IS. POINTING US IN AND WOULD ASK IF YOU WOULD AGREE WITH C. WTA'S- ASSESSMENT- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- FIRST I WOULD SAY- QUOTE CENTER LANGS OF OBSERVER ABOUT THE SORT OF THE- BOB WARMTH IN TELLING TO OF THEIR A BURIAL PLOT. SPEAKS FOR ITSELF- IT IN TERMS OF THE OF. IN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE GET CARE EARLIER ON COVERAGE EARLY ON RIGHT I THINK IT IS WITH THE ARMOR GOALS ARE STRONG OF TALENT ON THE COURT OF COURSE YOU KNOW IS AS THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ON- PRIORITY. INVESTMENTS OF OUR RACE- THAT'S- WHERE THE VICTIMS. OF THE STATE HAS TO SB. MUCH OF THE. IF WE OF THE EVOLUTION OF COST OF LIVING AND TELL SINCE THE TIME PLEASE SUPPLEMENTS WERE ABOLISHED IN ONE THEY ARE NOW I MEAN IF YOU- ATTENDS A BENEFICIARY. ALL IS HOME AND HAS HOMEOWNER INSURANCE THE DEDUCT IS PROBABLY HIGHER OR AS- AS YES LIMIT SO IF THERE. HAVE THAT MUCH IN YOU KNOW. BECAUSE THEY ANTICIPATING WHAT HAPPEN. IN THE EVENT A- FIRE FLOOD CONTROL OR THINGS WERE FROM- IT'S. IT'S NOT EXCESSIVE BROWN'S THE PROBLEM. YEAH I'D LIKE YEAH ON. I WILL THANK YOU AND- KNOWING THAT IT IS A LINE WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE MINISTRY IS MOVING I WOULD- ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUE FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS CALL AND TO. THIS THAT WE CAN GET THERE A LITTLE FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU CHAIR JUST JUST DOING A COUPLE GOOGLE SEARCHES. THE MEDIAN INCOME IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND CAL WILL SEVEN EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR. AND GOOGLING. HOW MUCH SHOULD I PUT IN MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THE ANSWERS WE GET BACK OR THREE TO SIX MONTHS. OF OUR ANNUAL INCOME. SO JUST BASED ON SIMPLE NUMBERS IN A SIMPLE GLOBAL SEARCH- EVEN MOVING. THE ASSET LIMIT TO TEN THOUSAND I HONESTLY DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH- BECAUSE OF WITH IT THE WORD PUNISHING PEOPLE. WE HAVE WORKED HARD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AS IS DR ABULAFIA WENT OUT. WITH OUR ELDERLY. AND YOU KNOW WE GET IN THESE BURIAL PLOT DISCUSSIONS WE GET AND ALL THESE OTHER DISCUSSIONS. ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WORK THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO. HOLD ON TO THE FAMILY FARM THE FAMILY BUSINESS. THANK CENTER- AND IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE CALIFORNIA IN AND YES I'M A REPUBLICAN THING CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. REFER GONNA DO THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR FAMILIES OUT THERE STRUGGLING FOR GOING TO INCREASE OUR WHOLE. FOR THIS INSURANCE WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS ASSESSMENT. I MEAN THAT THE BASIC NUMBERS JUST DICTATE THAT. SO I'M GONNA LEAVE THAT WITH THAT DIRECTOR LIKE BORN I'D I'D LOVE YOUR HELP IN CHANGING THAT MENTALITY. ON IT TO GET RID OF THIS ASSESSMENT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ONLINE NOT AN ANSWER FOR NOW WITH SOMETHING TO WORK. TOWARDS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MISSED CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL HAS NO POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS IT'S REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT THE ABILITY TO HAVE HEALTH CARE HAS NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE ABOUT CREATING DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES AND POLICY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ENSURES THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND OUR ABILITY TO LIVE IN DIGNITY AS WE RETIRE AS WE GROW OLD IS OUR RIGHT AS WELL AS CALIFORNIANS OF THOSE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ELIMINATING THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE AS A STATE POLICIES HAVE BEEN CREATED THAT MAKE IT. EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHAT LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. OR ANY OTHER BARRIER THAT COMES YOUR WAY WE SHOULD BE CREATING POLICIES THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY HELP PEOPLE AND INSTEAD. POLICIES HAVE BEEN CREATED THAT ACTUALLY MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE. A GENERATIONAL WEALTH TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE FAMILY FARM TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR YOUR MODEST HOME. TO HAVE A SAVINGS IN YOUR ACCOUNT FOR YOUR RETIREMENT. THIS IS NOT WERE CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE OR ROOM WHERE THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE AND IF WE COULD SET A TONE THAT'S DIFFERENT. FOR ONE OF THE LARGEST STATE IN THE UNION. THEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WE JUST NEED THE POLITICAL COURAGE THE GOES BEYOND PARTISAN LINES TO ACTUALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY. HELP PEOPLE WHICH IS THE CHARGE THAT WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR. IF WAS WELL SIR I THINK YOU. HAVE TO ECHO. MY COLLEAGUE MISS CARRILLO THIS. STAY MANDATE I ALSO CONTINUE TO HEAR THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST THE STATE. NINE IT'S GONNA POINT ONCE AGAIN TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S ET DE REPORT. OUR STATE IS BLUE OVER TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. SAY IT AGAIN TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. BUT YET WE'RE HAVING A FINANCIAL DEBATE. ABOUT ENSURING. FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE RICHEST STATE IN THE UNION. TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GET HEALTH CARE THEY CAN GET VISION THEY CAN GET DENTAL. IMAGINE WHAT OUR STATE COULD LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU. OKAY JUST TO CUT THEIR IN HERE ANYONE ELSE I JUST JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN THAT WAY HE WILL WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL- SO THE REPORT INDICATES THAT ROUGHLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO AN ASSET TEST WHAT IS THE BREAKDOWN LOOK LIKE ARE THESE PRIMARILY SENIORS- DO WE HAVE. A HANDLE ON. THAT CAN WE HAVE A- BACK OF THE BACK OF THE NAPKIN ESTIMATE OF WHAT'S YOU KNOW WITH WITH THIS POPULATION LOOKS LIKE. SO THIS IS RUNNING SO IT WOULD BE FOR OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THERE CAN ALSO BE SEEN. MATTER EMBARRASSED SO UP THERE OVER THE- THAT MATCH I INCOME LIMITS THEY CAN ALSO BE IN THERE BUT THE MAJORITY ARE OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK THOSE NUMBERS CREDIT IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE COVERAGE GROUPS THAT WE COVER IN THE MORNING OUR PROBLEM- SO. THE TIMING OF MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE ASSET TEST- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS MOVE INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM- WE THOUGHT WE HEARD YOU SAY WE COULDN'T DE CHANGE WHAT'S AN ASSET VERSUS WHAT'S NOT AN ASSET BECAUSE OF THE SARS MIGRATION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CAN YOU RE EXPLAIN THAT OR DID WE- HEAR THAT WRONG. NO SO YOU'RE HEARD THAT CORRECTLY SO AT THE TIME THAT WE HAD CONTAINED THE ESTIMATES ON THAT SONG. I'M IN IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT A TIMELINE FOR WHEN THEY COULD MAKE THOSE CHANGES- THOSE WOULD BE CHANGES AND THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US IN TERMS OF HOW WE WERE LOOKING AT MAKING THE CHANGES. TO THE ASSET LIMIT SO- WE TEND TO WORK WE DO WORK WITH OUR OUR SAAS PARTNERS IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH THE ESTIMATES FOR WHEN WE MAKE THESE CHANGES- BUT AGAIN I THINK WHICH ANYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THEN IF IT IS A POLICY. THAT IS- THEN WE HAVE HAVE THIS ON THE TIME I THINK WE HAVE ALL SHARE. OF WITH- LED. AS SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY. WITH MAKING CHANGES GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHERE WE'RE OUT WITH THE SYSTEM MIGRATION SO THERE MAY BE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THEY DO HAVE IN THE QUEUE THAT WOULD HAVE TO THEN BE. ACCOUNTED FOR IN DECISIONS WHAT HAVE WE NEED IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT FOR DO THEY CONTINUE TO ADVANCE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT THIS WOULD BE WORK. THAT IS NOT- BEEN CONTEMPLATED SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO FACTOR IN IF THERE WAS AN ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING OUR TEAM. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ONE- MIGRATION HAVE BEEN. BEEN COMPLETE. SO RE. OF WHETHER THERE'S LARGE. HERE ASKING THE CHANGED THE SOONEST WE COULD-EXPECT A CHANGE MAYBE EVEN POSSIBLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE ASSET TEST IS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WELL I THINK THAT. SO BASED UPON THE DECISION THAT'S ME MORE THEN WHAT WOULD THEN BE USED TO INFORM WHAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE WHAT'S SAUCE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR CAPABILITIES ARE THEY ALREADY HAVE. A FULL LIST OF POLICIES THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW POLICY AND CHANGE THAT WHAT HAPPENED THEN BE ACCOUNTED FOR. AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE- AVAILABILITY IS TO MAKE THE CHANGE PRIOR TO THE ESTIMATED TIMELINE THAT THEY PROVIDE. I THE TIME WHEN WE WERE ON THE- OKAY AREA IT'S A SEEMS LIKE AWFUL LONG TIME I MEAN REALLY. I UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW I JUST I JUST THAT MEANS I THINK SOMETIMES WE TRIP OVER CELLS WITH COMPLEXITY AND- AND SO ON I MEAN I THINK JUST THE COMPLEXITY THAT'S NEEDED TO DOCUMENT ASSETS CAN BE PRETTY ONEROUS YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT JEWELRY AND IN YOUR HAVE TO PRODUCE RECEIPTS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT IF I BOUGHT THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHERE IS THAT RECEIPT YOU KNOW BUT I REST DOESN'T REQUIRE ME TO KEEP ANYTHING BEYOND. SEVEN YEARS SO- YOU DON'T HAVE A RECEIPT YOU GONNA HAVE TO GET AN APPRAISAL SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO HAVE SOMETHING APPRAISED. TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT I CAN KEEP IT- THAT. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS JUST FEEL REALLY ONEROUS AND- AND YOU KNOW ADDING QUITE FRANKLY MORE INSULT TO INJURY ON TOP OF. WHAT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VULNERABLE AND- AND YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE SO THAT'S MORE ABOUT. WHERE THE COMMENT THAN A QUESTION- I JUST HOPE WE CAN AT SOME POINT- IF WE- MOVE MOVING FORWARD IF WE CAN YOU KNOW EXPEDITE THIS IT'S THIS HAS A REAL EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES AND- HERE IS CENTURY SAYING THAT WE- COULDN'T. WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT THEN AGAIN I JUST TO WONDER DOES WITH THIS WHEN IS IT GOING TO AFFECT IS IT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY SIX- THREE YEARS IS A LONG WHAT TIME TO WAIT. TO MAKE CHANGES BUT YOU KNOW AT WHAT POINT ARE WE AT THE END OF THE DECADE BEFORE WE SEE YOU KNOW- RELIEF FOR PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW I MEAN M. BUT IT JUST IT JUST FEELS LIKE UP CLOSE I GOT OFF A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL OF SPEAKERS- AND THIS IS ON MEDICARE ACID TEST HOW HOW THE MEDICO ACID TEST AFFECTS SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES- CHEN FLORIDA'S A POLICY ADVOCATE FRUIT WITH WESTERN CENTER AMMAN PART POVERTY AND CLEAR RAMSEY WHO IS A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING SO- WILL- GO AHEAD AND- LET YOU GUYS SO. COME ON AND JOIN US. GOOD MORNING THIS IS JANICE LORI WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- WE ARE THE STATE'S OLDEST AND LARGEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER AND WE WORK WITH LEGAL SERVICES AROUND THE STATE WHO HELP PEOPLE WITH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND DEALING WITH A MEDIC CAL ASSETS TEST WERE ALSO MEMBER OF THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE WHICH HAS HEALTH CONSUMER CENTERS AROUND THE STATE- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRS FOR HAVING- THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN PARTICULAR ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATIO WHO HAS BEEN OUR CHAMPION. ON MOVING FORWARD IN THIS ISSUE- I ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME WHO HAVE ALL BEEN ENGAGED IN REALLY ANALYZING HOW WE CAN START TO TAKE APART THE MEDIC HOW ASSETS TESTING CALIFORNIA. SO THE MEDICAL. JUST REALIZE IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE IT HASN'T SERIOUSLY BEEN REVISITED SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. YET OUR VIEWS ON HOW TO BEST RUN HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAM OR HOW TO BEST OFFER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THEN- KATHY SANDERLING SPOKE A LITTLE BIT BEFORE ABOUT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HOW THAT AFFECTED ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO FOCUS ON HOW THAT AFFECTED THE MEDIC HOW PROCESS SEES. THERE WAS A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN HOW WE DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE FOR MOST THE PEOPLE IN THESE PROGRAMS. PREVIOUSLY WE WERE RELIANT ON SEMI ANNUAL STATUS REPORTS PROOFS OF RESIDENCY DISABILITY DETERMINATIONS. AND WE MOVED TO A SYSTEM THAT BEGAN TO RELY MORE AND MORE ON USING ELECTRONIC DATABASES. AND REALLY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING MORE ON THE BACK AND RATHER THAN ASKING THE APPLICANT TO PROVE UP EVERYTHING ON THE FRONT EDGE- THIS AFFECTED NOT JUST APPLICATIONS BUT ALSO RENEWALS. SO FOR AN EXAMPLE OF THAT- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MATCH I POPULATION WHO ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE ASSET TEST. UPWARDS OF 50% OF THEM ARE ABLE TO RENEW THEIR MEDIC HOW EVERY YEAR WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. THE COUNTY WORKERS ARE ABLE TO CHECK ELECTRONIC DATABASES VERIFY THAT THEY'RE STILL ELIGIBLE AND THEN SEND THEM A NOTICE. SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND LET US KNOW IF THERE ANY CORRECTIONS IF NOT. YOU'RE GOOD TO GO- THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE ASSETS TEST. AND SO PART OF WHAT CAUSED THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN MEDIC CAL AND ROMANCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WASN'T JUST THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE BUT IT WAS THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ELIGIBLE ALL ALONG WHO CAN NOW. MORE EASILY GET ON MEDI CAL WE REFER TO THIS PHENOMENON AS THE WELCOME MATS AND I'M OUT AND ABOUT IN MEDICARE. FOR THOSE TO THAT TEST THOUGH WE QUITE ROLLED OUT THEN WELCOME MAT. IT'S STILL HARD TO GET AND STAY ON MEDICARE OUT AS THEY HAVE TOGETHER RECENT BANK ACCOUNT STATEMENTS THEY HAVE TO HAVE PROPERTY VALUE WOULD BE THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE WHAT THEY OWN. AND IN SOME CASES WHAT THEY NO LONGER OWNED- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED HERE IS AS LONG AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HAVE AN ASSETS TEST. THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED- BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONDUCT AUDITS OF BENEFICIARIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LYING ABOUT THEIR ASSETS. SO THERE WOULD ALSO BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS- TO NOT HAVE TO ENGAGE IN ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT AUDIT. I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT POLICYMAKERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE SAVINGS IN OTHER ARENAS. INCLUDING THROUGH THE NEW CAL SAVERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A RETIREMENT SAVINGS. SAVINGS OPTIONS THROUGH WORK. ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH FOR THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE AND MEDIC HAL. THEY'RE ACTUALLY PENALIZED WHEN THEY DON'T START THAT DEPLETING THEIR RETIREMENT JUST AS SOON AS THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY BY NOT REVISITING THE ROLE WE FURTHER INGRAINED INTO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM A RULE THAT PERPETUATE STRUCTURAL RACISM BOTH BY WHO GETS ON THE PROGRAM. AND BY THE SACRIFICES THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE. AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR LOS ANGELES PARTNERS HELP A WOMAN WHO NEEDED MEDICARE BECAUSE OUR TEETH WERE ROTTING. SHE WAS UNABLE TO GET MEDIC HOW BECAUSE SHE HAD TOO MUCH MONEY IN HER BANK ACCOUNT. BUT THE REASON THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH MONEY IN HER BANK ACCOUNT IS BECAUSE HER HUSBAND HAD TERMINAL CANCER AND SHE WAS SAVING MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS FUNERAL COSTS. SHE WAS UNABLE TO BRING HERSELF TO SPEND DOWN THE MONEY EVEN ON HER OWN DENTAL NEEDS. SO SHE WENT WITHOUT DENTAL CARE. WHEN YOU NEED PUBLIC ASSISTANCE DURING A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME IN LIFE. THE INABILITY TO ACCESS IT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT MEET THE PROGRAM CRITERIA FEELS DEEPLY PERSONAL. YOU FEEL THAT THE SYSTEM HAS JUDGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN AND DEEMED YOU UNWORTHY OF ASSISTANCE. THIS INDIVIDUAL FELT THE DENIAL OF MEDIKAL SHOULD THE SYSTEMS AND DIFFERENCE TO HER HUSBAND'S WORSENING HEALTH AND HIS ULTIMATE. NOW THAT COUNTY SANDERLING MENTIONED BEFORE THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE MILLIONAIRES WITHOUT INCOME WAITING TO GET ON MEDICARE HOW IS A BIT OF A UNICORN. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT HOWEVER IF ANYONE IS ABLE TO GET AROUND THE MEDIC HOW ASSETS TEST IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO'S WEALTHIER WHICH TYPICALLY MEANS SOMEBODY WHO'S WIDER. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND IT BY KNOWING WHICH BURIAL INSURANCE WITH NO CASH SURRENDER VALUE MIGHT WORK FOR THEM. OR IF THEY CAN WORK WITH A FAMILY MEMBER TO SET UP AN ABLE ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THEIR NEEDS IS THERE A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY. OR THEY CAN PURCHASE OTHER EXEMPT ASSETS OR THEY CAN DO THINGS TO BUSINESS ASSETS. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT KIND OF ACCESS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEYS OR TO OTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE MUST CHECK THIS IS IN REGULATIONS. SOME OF IT IS EVEN AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE NOT CODIFIED SO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SIGNIFICANT AGENCY GUIDANCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RULES WORK AND HOW YOU CAN BEST UTILIZE THEM. FURTHERMORE THE MEDIC HOW ASSETS TEST IS ANOTHER WHAT WAY ARE LAWS STRUCTURALLY DEPRIVE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF WEALTH. EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY SUBJECT TO THE TEST WANTED TO SAVE THEY COULDN'T. FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR HEALTH CARE. THEY CAN'T SAVE FOR THINGS THEY KNOW THEY NEED I SPOKE TO AN INDIVIDUAL THIS SUMMER IN LONG BEACH. BUT AS TO HOW THE ASSETS HAS HARMED HIM AND HE MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE WANTED TO VISIT HIS OWN FATHER WHO LIVED OUT BEYOND BIG BEAR OR HIS NEPHEWS THAT LIVE ON THE PAHLAVAS AVACEN YOU'RE DOING. THERE'S NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR WAY TO GET THERE SO THE ONLY WAY FOR HIM TO GET HIMSELF THERE WOULD BE IF YOU CAN DRIVE. HOWEVER BECAUSE HE NEEDS A VAN THAT SPECIALLY OUTFITTED TO ACCOMMODATE HIS WHEELCHAIR. HE CAN'T GET THERE HE USED TO HAVE ONE OF THESE BANDS BUT EVER SINCE THAT BAND BROKE DOWN HE HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ANOTHER ONE TO REPLACE IT. SO HE HE JUST CAN'T SAVE THE MONEY FOR THE THINGS WE NEED- AND WE HEAR COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO SAVE TO REPLACE THE ROOF- NOT BEING ABLE TO SAVE IN THE EVENT OF AN ADDICTION. OR ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED TO SAVE FOR- WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW HE THIS MADE HIM FEEL HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW WHAT THE WORD INDENTURED ME. AFTER SAID YES HE SAID WELL. THE IT MEDIC HOW MAKES ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE ON IT FEEL INDENTURED. IT'S LIKE WE NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION ON HOW TO LIVE OUR LIVES- SO IT. IN CLOSE THERE'S NO OTHER FORM OF HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE REST OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. THAT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO DOCUMENT A COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF THEIR ASSETS EVERY YEAR- POTENTIALLY AUDITS THEIR ASSETS AND LIMITS HOW THEY CAN SAVE. EXCEPT FOR THIS PART OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE CRUEL IRONY IS THE ONLY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THIS RULE ARE THOSE THAT HAVE LITTLE TO BEGIN WITH AND THE LEAST ABILITY TO INCREASE THEIR ASSETS. MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ASIAN DISABLED PROGRAM ARE ACTUALLY ON FIXED INCOMES THEY'RE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE OR WILL SOON BE LIVING THE WORK FORCE. IT'S PAST TIME WE STOP THE INEQUITY PERPETUATED BY THIS OUTDATED RULE AND REPEAL IT ENTIRELY. AND THEN FINALLY IT JUST TO AREAS- OF COST. SAVINGS THAT MAY BE THERE- FOR ONE THING WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT DH CS DID IN COMING UP WITH COST ESTIMATES AND WE RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH OF THIS IS COMPLETELY SPECULATIVE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH SUCH LOW INCOMES HAVE ASSETS AT ALL IN CALIFORNIA IS A CHALLENGE- BUT ONE AREA THAT WE FEEL THAT THE COST MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IS AROUND THE I. HSS COSTS THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES COST- AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IS. THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE EXPENSE FOR THIS BUT OUR EXPERIENCE AS LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES HAS BEEN THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED I. HSS- TEND TO GET ON THE PROGRAM FASTER THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH SEVERE MEDICAL NEEDS. THE OTHER AREA HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A BIT WHICH SIZE MIGRATION IF WE ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. THIS RULE AND TELL SAW'S MIGRATION IS COMPLETE THEN WE WOULDN'T BE PAYING FOR THREE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT IT SO THERE MAY ALSO BE A SAVINGS THERE- SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE- ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS ADMINISTRATION TO HIGHLY PRIORITIZE. ELIMINATING THE ASSETS TEST IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY TENDS TO AGREE WITH. BUT UNLESS PEOPLE START PUTTING IT AS A PRIORITY THAT THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD SPEND STATE DOLLARS IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FOR IT WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO CLEAR AT THIS POINT AND THEN WILL ASK QUESTIONS JOINTLY A FEW OF THE TWO OF YOU SO- MISS RAMSEY. THANK YOU- CHAIRS AND MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY. MY NAME IS CLINT RAMSEY I'M WITH JUSTICE IN AGING. AGING IS A NATIONAL LEGAL NONPROFIT THAT USES THE POWER OF WATER FIGHT TO YOUR PROPERTY. WHY WESTERN CENTER WE ARE ALSO. SUPPORTS AND WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LEGAL SERVICES PARTNERS ON MEDIC CAL AND ON HSS AND OTHER HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PROGRAM. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. YOUR STRONG VALUE BASE SUPPORT PROTECTING THOSE PROBLEMS- AND I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MEDICAID ASSET LIMIT WORKS AGAINST OUR VALUES TO BUILD A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. I'M GONNA DO THAT SORT OF BY FOCUSING ON. FIRST THE WAY WE CAN FIGHT RIGHT ENOUGH. THAT'S NOT HOW IT POVERTY SEEN AND PEOPLE WITH THIS. AND THEN HOW IT SUSTAINS THIS POP AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS BUT I REALLY WANT TO- GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THAT OPENS. UP FIRST. WITH REGARD CHIU RATIONS EXCUSE ME PERPETUATING IN WIDENING RACIAL INEQUALITY- YOU KNOW THE ASSET LIMIT APPEARS TO BE RACE NEUTRAL AND SOMETIMES WERE VERY- QUICK TO OVERLOOK THOSE TYPES OF POLICIES POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY. ELIMINATING INEQUALITY IN THE STATE BUT THE REASON THAT THIS MEDICARE RULE IS CREATING MORE OFFICIAL INEQUALITY IS BECAUSE WE TREAT DIFFERENT ASSETS DIFFERENTLY. AND SPECIFICALLY UNDER CURRENT COUNTING BOWLS HOME OWNERSHIP. IS NOT- COUNTED SO OUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE ISN'T COUNTED. IN OUR- YOU KNOW ASPECTS IT'S AN EXEMPT ASSET AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS AN OLDER ADULT. MORE LIKELY A WHITE OLDER ADULT COULD ONLY A MILLION DOLLAR HOME. WALL BLACK OLDER ADULT WHO'S LESS LIKELY TO OWN A HOME COULD HAVE A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND THAT WILL PUT THEM OVER THE ASSET LIMIT. AND TO QUANTIFY THIS SOMEWHAT IS- IN RECENT RESEARCH BASED ON SAN FRANCISCO THEIR OWN HOME WELL ONLY 33% OF BLACK RESIDENTS DO. IN AN LA IT WAS 50% OF WHITE RESIDENTS OWNING OUR OWN HOME. AND THEY'RE ONLY 33% OF BLACK RESIDENTS OWNING YOUR OWN HOME AS WELL. WE CAN REALLY SEE THAT STARK DIFFERENCE WHERE THE HOME OWNERSHIP- YOU KNOW YOU CERTAINLY COULD BE LOW INCOME AND OWN A HOME. AND GOT CREATES ITS OWN SET OF PROBLEMS BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T CREATE A PROBLEM IS FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY ACCESS META CAL. AND SO WE SEE THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS BEEN RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF REDLINING AND PREDATORY LENDING AND DISCRIMINATION AND HOME OWNERSHIP- AND THEN WE CREATE EVEN. ADDITIONAL HURDLES NOW TO GET ON HEALTHCARE AND ON TO MEDIC HOW- BY CREATING A ROLE THAT. SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITS HOW MUCH THE AND ONE CAN HAVE IN A BANK ACCOUNT- AND STILL GET ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. I'M NEXT I REALLY THAT- HI. THE WAY THAT MEDIC HOW. YOU KNOW WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S PRIMARY HEALTH. CARE PROGRAM WHICH IT IS BUT YOU KNOW RESEARCH HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT IT IS ALSO A HUGELY IMPACTFUL WAY TO REDUCE POVERTY. OLDER ADULTS- A BIG DRIVER OF POVERTY FOR OLDER ADULTS IS HEALTHCARE COSTS. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT- WE SEE EVEN WITH MEDICARE WHICH IS A GREAT PROGRAM IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS TO SUCCESSFULLY- GET ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS AFFORDABLE. AND THAT'S WHY MEDICAL BECOME SO IMPORTANT. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MET A COW BEING AFFECTED AND HE POVERTY PROGRAM WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE AWAY THE ASSET TEST WERE SUBSTANTIALLY RAISING TO REALLY GET THAT EFFECT FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE INCLUDING HOLDING COMMUNITY SERVICES IS VITAL FOR BOTH PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY I'M I WANT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR- PARTNERS WHO WORKS IN A MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP SHARED A STORY ABOUT A CLIENT SHE'S CURRENTLY HELPING US IN OUR SEVENTIES AND IS TRYING TO GET. ON TO MEDICARE. OF THE CLIENT SINGLE AND WORK FOR MANY YEARS THE PACKAGING DEPARTMENT OF A FACTORY. IN HER LIFETIME SHE WAS ABLE TO SAVE ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- SHE'S NOW BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEMENTIA AND SHE CANNOT LIVE ALONE ANYMORE- SHE'S MOVED IN WITH HER BROTHER AND HER BROTHER. AND OBVIOUSLY WITH ONLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. AND ONLY SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY HIM. SO NOW THAT'S CREATING FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY- SO NOW SHE'S REALLY FACED WITH THE CHOICE. OF SHE CAN SPEND DOWN BELOW TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE MEDICATION NEEDS UNLIKELY OBJECT MENTIONING I JUST AS SHE WOULD NEED SO THAT'S- GOING TO HAVE TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR FAMILY. BUT ALSO IT'S REALLY PUTTING HER FAMILY'S. FINANCIAL STABILITY IN DISTRESS AS WELL BECAUSE IF SHE HAS ANY- NEEDS THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARY BEYONCE OR HER MONTHLY NEEDS SHE NOW DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND- AND SHE HAS TO BASICALLY DEPLETE HER ALREADY VERY MODEST SAVINGS. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY. IT'S SORT OF STARTLING BUT IT'S ALSO VERY TYPICAL YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AGAIN PEOPLE WITH. FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S GENERALLY EXTREMELY MODEST AND THAT'S WHAT THE STATE OVER THEIR ENTIRE LIFETIME. AND NOW IT'S REALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED- AND ONE THING I ALSO REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS SO THAT'S YOU KNOW A THRESHOLD ISSUE OF GETTING ON TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BUT- YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH. THOSE RESOURCE LIMITS THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SO THAT'S WHY IT ALSO NOT ONLY CREATES POVERTY BUT THAT IT CAN SUSTAIN IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE SAVINGS. BUT TO CONTINUE SAVINGS SO- THE- BOB BAER YOUR FOR THAT IS IF YOU GO OVER THE LIMIT BY ONE DOLLAR YOU'RE ACTUALLY TERMINATED FROM THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S A BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE INCOME LIMIT AND THE ASSET LIMITS TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING- FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS NOT RAISING THE INCOME LIMIT. YOU KNOW AT LEAST PEOPLE COULD STAY ON THE PROGRAM YOU WANT TO SHARE OF COSTS INSURANCE COSTS HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES BUT ASSETS ACTUALLY TERMINATE YOU FROM THE PROGRAM SO IF YOU GO ONE DOLLAR OVER YOUR TERMINATE SO AGAIN GIVEN THE CHOICE PEOPLE CAN NEVER ACCRUE MEANINGFUL SAVINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SCARED TO GET BUMPED OFF A BETTY CAL. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER HAD CLIENTS PAYING MORE THAN WHEN THEY ARE TERMINATED FROM MEDICAID EVEN LOSS OF INCOME LIKE IN TERMINATED FROM SSI OFTEN DIDN'T RANK AS FRIGHTENING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY KNEW ONCE THEIR MEDICARE WAS CUT OFF THEIR ACCESS TO A HUGE. VARIETY OF PREVENTATIVE CARE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT- DISEASE PREVENTION ONGOING TREATMENTS WAS GOING TO STOP SO YOU KNOW IT'S TRULY FRIGHTENING TO THEM TO FACE THAT- AND SO I WANT TO SHARE A STORY OF A WOMAN I ATUALLY WORKED WITH A FEW YEARS AGO- WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED AND FRANTIC WHEN SHE CAME IN BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED A TERMINATION NOTICE FROM MEDIC HELL BECAUSE SHE WAS OVER THE ASSET LIMIT. SO WE WERE TALKING SHE EXPLAINED THAT- SHE HAD BEEN SITTING BECAUSE SHE NEEDED TO HEARING AIDS AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SO EXPENSIVE SHE NEED TO DO THAT OVER TIME SHOULD SLOWLY BEEN SAVING AND FINALLY SAVED THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SHE NEEDED- SO WHAT SHE DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT SHE WAS DOING THAT WASTHAT THAT SEATINGS WAS GOING TO PUSH HER OVER THE MEDIC CALUMET AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY GONNA LEAD TO HER TERMINATION. FROM THE PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW SORT OF. IN HER CASE. SHE HAD WHERE WITH ALL TO SEE HELP KNEW THAT WE MEDICAID WOULD BE AS- PROBLEM FOR HER AND- WE WERE ABLE TO HELP HER GET BACK ON THE PROGRAM. BY SPENDING DOWN THE MONEY AND BUYING HEARING AIDS SHE NEEDED BUT- YOU KNOW IT. IS ALWAYS STUCK WITH FEEDBACK YOU KNOW SITTING THERE IN MY OFFICE TALKING THIS WOMAN EXPLAINING. JUST ABSOLUTELY PUNITIVE AND NONSENSICAL. GRAMMARLY TO HER WAS YOU KNOW SHE UNDERSTOOD IT. ON ONE LEVEL JITTERS ABOUT WAS THE RULES BUT SHE WAS REALLY STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT MADE ANY SENSE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS- AND AS WE WERE TALKING AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS TESTIFYING YOU KNOW ONE OF THINGS THAT KEPT COMING UP AND- ORIGINAL. SPEECH BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT QUICKLY IS THE PREVENTATIVE CARE ASPECT OF THIS YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED A LOT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY WAIT EVERY WEEK TO GET WHAT THEY NEED AND WE'RE NOW SEEING% BECAUSE THE AC HAS OPENED UP COVERAGE WITH SO MANY PEOPLE REALLY SEEM THOSE. REALLY ACADEMIC RIGOR STUDIES NOW THAT ARE ACTUALLY SHOWING THE WAYS IN WHICH PREVENTIVE CARE IS REALLY MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT YESTERDAY ON HEALTHCARE IS PUBLISHED A STUDY FROM UCLA CENTER FOR POLICY HELP IF YOU NEED FOR HEALTH POLICY AND- IN CONJUNCTION WITH UNITS. OF CHILE WHERE WE- FOUND. THAT THE ACA REDUCE CANCER THE CANCER DETECTION SPIKE THAT USED TO OCCUR AT AGE SIXTY FIVE BY 45% SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS. BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN UNINSURED UNTIL SIXTY FIVE. A WHEN THEY SHOWED UP AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BASED ON THIS HUGE SPIKE IN CANCER- DETECTION BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BASICALLY BEEN IGNORING SYMPTOMS. UNABLE TO GET PREVENTIVE CARE AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE DID GET THEIR CANCERS DETECTED THEY WERE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FAR ALONG IN TERMS OF SEVERITY. SO THE OTHER THING THAT'S HELPED REDUCE WAS- THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE CANCERS DETECTED. EARLIER MAJOR MIDDLE STAGES AND WERE MORE HIGHLY TREATABLE. SO I JUST WANT TO REALLY SHOW HOW EFFECTIVE COVERAGE ISN'T KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY AND I KNOW WE STAND ALL THE TIME BUT THAT TO ME JUST FELT LIKE. SUCH A STARK REMINDER OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THE CARE THEY NEED. THEY CAN STAY HEALTHIER AND GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED- AND LASTLY BEFORE BECAUSE I JUST REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HOW THIS ALL REALLY ALSO FITS IN WITH OUR STATE GOALS AROUND THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. BUT I WAS ON THE LTSS SUBCOMMITTEE AND JUSTICE IN AGING WAS ALSO- MY- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WAS ALSO ON THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY. COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW THE MASTER PLAN JUST CAME OUT FROM GOVERNOR'S. IN JANUARY AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CHANGING THIS POLICY. IS IN LINE WITH THREE OUT OF THE FIVE GOALS. A BROAD GOALS FOR THE MASTER PLAN AND THAT'S TO BASICALLY ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO INCREASE EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA AND TO REDUCE POVERTY AMONG. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND SO I JUST REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT COULD REALLY SHOWS WHAT A POWERFUL BACK ADDRESSING THIS OUTDATED CAN HOW- JUST ONE RULE CHANGE CAN CAUSE HUGE DIFFERENCE. UP AND REALLY ADVANCE IS THREE REALLY MEANINGFUL POLICY GOALS AND CREATE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL SO WITH THAT I'LL STOP AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM COMING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS DR ABDUL- FIRST I ALWAYS LOVE TALKING WITH LEGAL AID LAWYERS LIKE I THINK IT'S IN PART BECAUSE MY MOM HAS ONE AND- SE FIGHTS TO HELP TO KEEP PEOPLE- TO GET THEM THE COVERAGE THEY HAVE WHEN THEY HAVE INTERESTS. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE- I DON'T INHERENTLY HAVE A QUESTION BUT I FOUND YOUR- TESTIMONY QUITE POWERFUL. YOUR LAST WORDS WERE IT'S A STARK REMINDER BUT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. I WAS PARTICULARLY MOVED BY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HOW THIS CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE THOSE. INCOME INEQUALITIES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN IF I COULD ON TO ONE OF CHEN FLURRIES COMMENTS. WHERE SHE- HAD ASKED THE PERSON O YOU KNOW WHAT THE TERM INDENTURED. BECAUSE EARLIER WE HEARD THAT THE ACID TEST WAS A GATE KEEPER IF YOU WILL. BUT NOW THAT IMAGE IS DIFFERENT IF WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT- THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE DIFFERENTLY AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THAT. AND SO RATHER THAN MAKING A METAPHOR THAT. MIGHT PUSH IT TOO FAR I SIMPLY. BELIEVE THAT HIS STATEMENT IS POWERFUL AND THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IF PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS BASED OFF OF THE POLICIES WE HAVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP MAKE AND IMPROVE UPON THOSE. WITH THAT I WILL END BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE SAID IT MUCH BETTER THAN CLEAR RAMSEY OCEAN FLOORING- AND DO WANTS TO WELCOME CHEN TO HER NEW ROLE WE WILL MISS JESSICA. FORWARD WORKING WITH HER IN HER NEW ROLE- I KNOW YOU BRING UP A LOT TO WESTERN CHANNEL ON POVERTY IS. MR TRUMP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER OR COMMENTS ON THIS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I. THINK OF MISS LORI MISSILE RAMSEY FOR ALL THEIR- DILIGENT WERE AND WORK WITH WITH MY OFFICE ON ON MOVING THIS- MEDICAL ASSET ELIMINATION. PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- RE INTRODUCING THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND- ANY MEMBER THAT IS. THAT HAS BEEN AT THIS HEARING OR IS WATCHING THE HEARING. AND WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT THERE PLEASE. TEXT ME LET ME KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS. TOO AGAIN OR LET MY OFFICE KNOW AGAIN TO THE POINT BEING MADE EARLIER. A BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. AND IT IS IT IS MORE AND MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED FOR US TO REVISIT. A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. HELP PEOPLE WHICH I EIGHT CONTINUOUSLY KEEPS SAYING IN IN THIS HEARING. BECAUSE WE GET LOST I THINK AND HOW MUCH TO SOMETHING COST. VERSUS WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS FROM WE ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS HEALTHCARE. AND I WANT TO BRING UP THE SITUATION ON THE FINANCIAL- BANKING. WHEN IT WHEN. THE EXAMPLES THAT ARE BEING GIVEN IN TERMS OF YOU CAN'T HAVE X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. OR IN YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THOSE RESOURCES AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING. MORE POVERTY WE'RE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES- ARE ACTUALLY AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO STORE THOSE FUNDS. YOU KNOW IN THEIR HOMES- NOT HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALL IN AN EFFORT TO CIRCUMVENT AND GO AROUND. CERTAIN POLICIES ON ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT YOU KNOW AND END UP. WITH YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR PARTNER OR YOURSELF INDIVIDUALLY I CRINGE AT THE EXAMPLE. THAT I BELIEVE MISS LORI. I TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE WOMAN WHO IS SAVING FOR HER HER HUSBAND'S. CANCER TREATMENT AND UNABLE TO YEAH. DE IS THE BE OF THAT THAT IS NOW. BE IN. OF WHAT THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST SHOULD BE WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE CHANGE IT HOW WE FIX IT HOW WE MODERNIZE IT IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AND FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT AND HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO MOVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BOARD. AND THE STATE UNFORTUNATELYDURING COVE IT HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF LIGHT IN TERMS OF OF FUNDS. LOSING FUNDS FRAUD SO THIS IDEA THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. IS NOT REALLY THE REALITY. IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHERE WE PUT OUR VALUE IN THE BUDGET- AND SO I'M EXCITED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- I'M WARY ABOUT THE TIME THAT IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN TERMS OF WHEN CAN WE POSSIBLY GET IT DONE. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED HELP NOW- MORE SO THAN EVER BEFORE AND SO I YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA A COMMON AND THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR TODAY AND THANK YOU TO BOTH OF OUR CHAIRS FOR HAVING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. AND HOPEFULLY WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO PUT. OUR OUR OUR VALUE IN OUR BUDGET AND ULTIMATELY AGAIN HELP PEOPLE I HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CARILLO ANYONE'S MISERABLES COULD. I JUST WELL FIRST OFF THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR- COMMENTS IN YOUR YOUR YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR EXPERTISE- I PASSED- I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION EARLIER TODAY BUT I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS- HOW YOU KNOW HOW OF OHER STATES USE THE- THEIR THIRTIES TO ADOPT LESS RESTRICTIVE ASSET LIMITS DO YOU HAVE A- OR SOMETHING BUT SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD POINT TO IS TO HAVE. HAVING BEEN ABLE TO DO A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB. WE HAVE- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT TO DO NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ASSETS OUT THERE PLOTS LIFE INSURANCE- AND I THINK ABOUT INCH I JUST THINK THAT JUST INSURANCE IN GENERAL IF YOU'VE GOT AN OLDER CAR. YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO HAVE- COLLISION INSURANCE ON IT AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A REALLY HIGH DEDUCTIBLE- IF YOU'RE IN AN ACCIDENT- YOU THEN YOU YOU YOU WOULD POTENTIALLY SUCK UP YOUR ENTIRE SAVINGS TO. YOU KNOW TO PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE ON THE CAR- WHICH YOU TO YOUR BANK YOU YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE SO- YOU KNOW FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO STATES HAVE TO BUY WHAT'S AN ASSET WHAT'S NOT AN ASSET. M. AS- SO WE SHOULD BE MENTIONED BE. SCMA HAS A BY. THAT STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE- THE CAP ON ASSETS AS WELL AS THE EXEMPTIONS INDEFINITELY- THEY CLARIFIED IN THAT GUIDANCE THAT THEY CAN HAVE MUCH HIGHER LEVELS. ARE MUCH HIGHER CAPS OR NO CAPS AT ALL- SO ARIZONA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT TOOK THAT AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT FOR THE LONG TERM CARE POPULATION- BUT THEY DID FOR THEIR ENTIRE MEDICARE POPULATION SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO. GET INTO ALL OF THE DETAILS UP- SO YOU HAVE LIFE INSURANCE IS THE RIGHT KIND OF LIFE INSURANCE YOUR BURIAL INSURANCE IS THERE CASH SURRENDER VALUE- YOU KNOW IT ALL OF. EVEN WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE PROGRAM BETTER BY PUTTING EXEMPTIONS IN THAT THAT INEVITABLY MAKES THE PROGRAM MORE COMPLICATED- SO YOU KNOW OUR PREFERENCE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE TO REPEAL IT ENTIRELY AND NOT GO DOWN THESE WORMHOLES. OF WHAT KIND OF ASSET DO YOU HAVE. TO THE EXTENT ANYTHING IS CAPPED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EXEMPTIONS ARE AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE. A AN ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEY OR SOMEBODY WITH ADVANCED LEGAL KNOWLEDGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT FITS UNDER THE RULE AND WHAT DOESN'T GET UNDER THE ROLE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN SIMPLICITY AND- WE SEEM TO GO INTO A LOT OF WORM HOLES IN THIS BUILDING AND I'M NOT SURE WE'D FIND OUR WAYS OUT SOME QUITE. SOMETIMES QUITE FRANKLY SO.

HEALTH ACTIVE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT REMOVING THE ASSET TAG AT THE BARRIER TO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE THE CURRENT ASSET TEST LIMITS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN DECADES AND THEY PREVENT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FROM CREATING ADEQUATE SAVINGS FOR A RAINY DAY. AS MENTIONED BY EITHER CALLING ON TODAY IT FORCES PEOPLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HAVING HEALTHCARE OR SAVING THEIR FINANCES FOR THINGS LIKE HAVING A FEW EXTRA MONTHS RAN ON AND- MOVING HOMES CARING FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OR EVEN PAYING FOR BASIC LIVING EXPENSES. WHILE COST OF LIVING AND HOUSING HAVE INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA APOTEX HAVE MAINTAINED THE SAME ASSET LIMIT ON SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IT IS TIME WE ADDRESS THE INJUSTICE AND PRESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHILE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PAY FOR BASIC NEEDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER PARTNERS STAKEHOLDERS THIS YEAR TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. NOW GO TO LAW. TWENTY SIX.
