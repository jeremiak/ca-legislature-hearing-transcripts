MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AB SIX

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:01.993
TENS A VERY SIMPLE BILL

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.794
CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:06.063
THAT WHEN A BALLOT IS PLACED ON

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.298
I'M SORRY WHEN A BOND MEASURES

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.766
PLACED ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:09.800
APPROVAL.

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.502
THAT ESTIMATE FOR THE TAX RATE

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:12.570
REQUIRED TO SERVICE THE BOND

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:14.372
ALSO BE PLACED IN THE LANGUAGE

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:15.706
FOR THE BALLOT STATEMENT.

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:17.475
CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:18.342
THAT.

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:19.844
X. RAY TO BE EXPRESSED IN

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.445
DOLLARS PER.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.713
HUNDRED SO DOLLARS PER HUNDRED

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.081
DOLLARS OF ASSESSED VALUE

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:24.949
HOWEVER.

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:27.018
ACCORDING TO ZILLOW THE AVERAGE

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.419
VALUE OF A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.588
IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:31.722
DOLLARS WHICH REQUIRES A FAIR

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.190
BIT OF MATH ON THE PART OF THE

00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:35.026
VOTER TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:36.661
THEIR TAX RATE WOULD BE ON THEIR

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:37.495
PROPERTY.

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.196
SO THIS BILL AB SIX TEN SIMPLY

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:40.631
REQUIRES THAT TAX RATE TO BE

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.900
EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.335
THOUSAND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.169
HAD A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:45.870
DOLLAR HOUSE.

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:46.971
YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO MULTIPLY

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.940
BY THREE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:52.310
WHICH WOULD BE ME OF THIRTY

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.178
THOUSAND SO ARE THERE IS A JUST

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:55.012
ONE LOT OF OPPOSITION THAT WE'VE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.614
GOT NOT THAT THAT'S FROM THE

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.783
COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE -- I'M

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.518
SORRY THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:01.953
SCHOOL HOUSING IN THAT

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.621
OPPOSITION LETTER THEY EXPRESSED

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.489
THE OPINION THAT -- IT WOULD BE

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.425
BETTER FOR VOTERS TO HAVE TO USE

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:08.960
A CALCULATOR TO FIGURE OUT THAT

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.860
TAX RATE.

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:11.662
I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE WITH

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.097
THAT SENTIMENT I THINK IT'S OF

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:14.899
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST VOTERS

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.100
WILL NOT PULL OUT THE CALCULATOR

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.201
THEY'VE GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.035
WITH THEIR TIME THEY'VE GOT OF

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:19.337
THINGS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON I

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.738
THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER. TO HAVE

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:22.673
THEM BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AT THE

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.441
TAX RATE THAT'S EXPRESSED AND

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:24.241
HAVING THEM AND HAVE THEM

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:25.476
INSTANTLY BE ABLE TO COME UP

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:27.445
WITH A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.179
THE VALUE.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.380
ALSO KIND OF WRITTEN BEHIND

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.514
BETWEEN THE LINES OF THE

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:31.849
COALITION'S LETTER A IS

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:32.783
SOMETHING THEY DON'T COME OUT

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.684
AND SAY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:34.952
I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.288
BY THE BELIEF THAT EXPRESSING

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:39.390
THE RATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:41.425
DOLLARS WOULD MAKE VOTERS LESS

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:43.227
LIKELY TO APPROVE BONDS YEAH AND

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.829
I ALSO VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:45.896
WITH THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.398
RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORTED AT

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.799
ALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH.

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.534
THE MORE THAT VOTERS DON'T

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.069
UNDERSTAND OR CONFUSED ABOUT A

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.171
BALLOT MEASURE THE MORE LIKELY

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:55.873
THEY ARE TO SIMPLY VOTE NOW AND

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.141
SO I THINK THAT THE BETTER JOB

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.442
THAT WE CAN DO IT INFORMING THEM

00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.910
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THE

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.312
PROS AND THE CONS WHAT THEY GET

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:01.579
AND WHAT.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:02.847
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.315
MORE LIKELY THEY ACTUALLY WILL

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.650
BE TO APPROVE.

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.752
A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT SO THIS

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.186
IS A VERY SIMPLE -- CIVIL

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:12.823
MEASURE THAT SO GOOD FOR VOTER

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.324
TRANSPARENCY I'D REQUEST

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.492

SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:21.365
OPPOSITION.

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.701
UNDER THE BILL.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:27.938
I HAVE A MOTION.

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:32.610
I HAVE A SECOND.

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:33.778
THE MORNING REBEKAH CURLY ON

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.112
BEHALF OF THE COALITION PRODUCT

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:36.981
AT SCHOOL HOUSING -- WE DO

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:39.350
OPPOSE A. B. SIX TEN WE VERY

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.485
MUCH APPRECIATE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:42.820
THE INTENTION OF COMMUNICATING

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.221
VERY CLEARLY WITH VOTERS

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.723
REGARDING THE IMPACT

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.658
IMMEASURABLE HAVE ON THEM -- THE

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.226
TAX RATE STATEMENT THAT WE'RE

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.228
TALKING ABOUT IS A GREAT TOOL TO

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:52.697
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION.

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.298
UP WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:55.399
TEN ACTUALLY PROVIDE PROVIDE

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.368
VOTERS WITH LASSEN SPECIFICITY

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.803
REGARDING THEIR PARTICULAR

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:00.738
SITUATION AND THE SPECIFIC

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:01.505
ASSESSED VALUATION OF THE

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:02.306
PROPERTY.

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.875
THAT THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.444
VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY UNDER

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.845
THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE A

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:10.381
GUESSTIMATE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:11.282
THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGES.

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.384
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEIR HOME IS

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:14.351
THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:14.952
THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'RE GOING

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.021
TO LOOK AND SEE THREE HUNDRED

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:17.555
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:19.223
APPROXIMATELY ACTS FOUR HUNDRED

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.191
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE A

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.325
DIFFERENT NUMBER I'M SOMEWHERE

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:23.127
IN THE MIDDLE -- WITH THE

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.062
CURRENT LAW AND THE TAX RATE

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:25.596
STATEMENT.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.431
OF CENTS PER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.966
ASSESSED VALUATION IT'S A VERY

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.968
SIMPLE MATH CALCULATION AND YOU

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.137
CAN GET PRECISELY THE IMPACT ON

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.438
THE INDIVIDUAL VOTER AND THEIR

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.840
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:38.209
SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO OPPOSE

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:38.943
EIGHTY SIX TEN IT'S AN EXAMPLE

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.578
OF UP WE BELIEVE THE CHANGES

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.379
UNNECESSARY WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.614
TRYING TO SOLVE.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.515
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.015
ACTUALLY INCREASE VOTER

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.851
CONFUSION THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:50.221
VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:51.388
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.289
SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:54.458
COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:54.725
COMMENTS.

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.560
MR MON.

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.229
FAMOUS SHARON THANK YOU MISS

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:00.431
ROBIN ULTI AND I KNOW YOUR GOALS

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:02.266
GOOD ONE HERE TO BRING CLARITY.

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.901
FOR VOTERS I'M TRYING.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.136
TO GET BY MY HEAD AROUND THIS

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:07.271
YEAR SO IT WOULD THERE BE

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.405
EXAMPLE WHERE.

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:09.473
IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY UNLIKELY

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.676
WITH EXAMPLES OF PROPERTY.

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.211
EVALUATION UNDER A HUNDRED

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:16.981
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:19.316
SURE SO.

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.018
IS ON THE BALLOT MEASURE.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.153
AND WHAT IT APPLIES TO THERE ARE

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.621
VERY MANY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.589
THAT ARE WORTH UNDER A HUNDRED

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:26.123
THOUSAND DOLLARS CERTAINLY

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.258
VACANT PROPERTIES -- A LOT OF

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.326
THEM ARE WORTH HUNDRED UNDER A

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:29.894
HUNDRED THOUSAND MANY BONDS

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.395
DON'T APPLY TO THE VACANT

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.664
PROPERTIES BUT SOME DO -- WHAT

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.332
ELSE POSSESSORY INTERESTS THAT'S

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:36.467
ANOTHER THING THAT SOMETIMES

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:37.501
THAT CERTAINLY ON PROPERTY TAX

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.270
RULES SOMETIMES BONDS CAPTURE

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:41.205
THOSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BOB

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.640
ON SECURE PROPERTY LIKE BOATS?

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:43.674
BOB CERTAINLY MANY OF THOSE

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.209
WORTH UNDER THE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.310
DOLLARS AGAIN SOME BONDS CAPTURE

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:49.647
THOSE SOME DON'T -- BUT THE

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:50.714
OTHER VAST MAJORITY WOULD BE

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.483
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND THANK

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.384
YOU FOR THAT'S HOUSE YOU KNOW

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.652
THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF OF

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.687
HOMES BUT YEAH THERE'S A WHOLE

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:59.056
RANGE OF PROPERTIES THAT WOULD

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.658
BE INCLUDED HERE CELL.

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:02.159
I THINK A HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.694
IS PRETTY PRETTY LOW AND THAT

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:04.962
DOES REQUIRE A CALCULATOR TO

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.964
COME OUT.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.365
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED SOMETHING

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:11.135
LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS WHERE --

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.204
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINK IN TERMS

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.005
OF PROPERTY VALUE IN.

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:18.008
THE END THOUSANDS INCREMENTS OF

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:21.645
A THOUSAND YOU KNOW MY CONDO NOW

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:24.882
MY CONDO A CONDO -- WORTH TWO

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:25.449
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.284
KNOW YOU DO THAT MATH TWO

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.819
HUNDRED TIMES THAT NUMBER YOU

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:29.687
SEE.

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:32.089
ON THE BALLOT IS THAT A SIMPLER

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.891
CALCULATION OF CLARITY IS THE

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.292
GOAL.

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.927
I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IF YOU

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.095
MAKE IT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:38.963
DOLLAR STANDARD AND YOU'VE GOT

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.798
PROPERTY LESS THAN A HUNDRED

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.399
THOUSAND THAT CAN BE MISLEADING

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.400
I WOULD THINK UNDER CERTAIN

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.668
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:46.170
SO IF CLARITY IS THE ULTIMATE

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:48.105
GOAL HERE'S OUR A SIMPLER WAY TO

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.206
DO THIS THAT.

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.641
IS MORE INCLUSIVE OF ALL

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:53.544
PROPERTY -- BUT BUT BRINGS

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.646
ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN.

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:56.580
AND OUT.

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:57.848
NOT IN MY CASE I'M NOT VERY GOOD

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:59.884
AT MATH BUT FOR SOME FOLKS THEY

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.118
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:01.819
THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREMENTS

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.053
CALCULATION AND THEY'RE HEADING

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.289
IN A VERY -- QUICK SNAPSHOT OF

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.891
WHAT THEY'D BE PAY YOU KNOW IT

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.125
IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.628
BECAUSE I THINK THAT PER HUNDRED

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.295
THOUSAND IS SIMPLER IF YOU HAVE

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.864
A HOME IT'S WORTH MORE THAN A

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.432
HUNDRED THOUSAND ODD.

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:17.034
HOWEVER PER THOUSAND WOULD BE A

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:18.235
VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:20.037
HAVE BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.205
NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.806
FIGURE OUT WITH THE MATH THAT

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:23.974
YOU'D LIKE TO DO.

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:24.942
USING EXAMPLE FROM THE

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:27.912
OPPOSITION'S WATER BECAUSE I'M

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.246
FAIR MINDED THAT WAY.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.614
THE THE OPPOSITION'S LETTER THE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:33.384
EXAMPLES A HOUSE WORTH THREE

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:33.984
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:34.818
AND EXPRESS TACK RATE IS A

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.987
NICKEL PER HUNDRED DOLLARS SO

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:37.888
JUST THINK FOR A MINUTE.

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.290
WHAT YOU WOULD DO EVEN IF YOU

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.925
HAVE A CALCULATOR SITTING IN

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:41.425
FRONT OF YOU TO DO THAT

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.760
CONVERSION?

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:45.529
BUT MOST CALIFORNIANS I CANNOT

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.830
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO BUT IT'D

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.766
BE MUCH SUPPORT WITH PER

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:49.400
THOUSAND JUST MULTIPLIED BY THE

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.000
NUMBER OF THOUSANDS.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.335
IN YOUR VALUES SO THAT WOULD BE

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.304
MULTIPLIED BY THREE SEVENTY FIVE

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.305
WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO FIGURE

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:56.140
OUT SO -- THAT BUT I THINK A

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:57.107
HUNDRED PER HUNDRED THOUSAND IS

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.343
BETTER PER THOUSAND IS A VAST

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.911
IMPROVEMENT OVER.

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:01.912
OVER WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW AND AND

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.380
FRANKLY JUST I'M WORKING MY WAY

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.182
THROUGH THE STAGES OF GRIEF HERE

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.517
I'VE GOTTEN A BARGAINING SO.

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.752
HI IF IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:12.056
OKAY WITH EXPRESSING THE REAPER

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:12.690
THOUSAND I'D BE WILLING TO AMEND

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.191
THE BILL THAT WAY.

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.960
SO I FEAR THAT I'VE MADE OF

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.227
SURPRISE THE CHAIR HERE WITH

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.562
THAT SUGGESTION AND SOMETHING

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:21.432
THAT I JUST THE THOUGHT OF QUITE

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:22.299
LITERALLY ON THE ELEVATOR UP

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:22.933
HERE.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.902
BUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS A

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.003
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.404
AND I'D HAVE TROUBLE SUPPORTING

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:28.973
THE BILL BEFORE US.

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:31.442
BUT MORE THAN HAPPY -- TO TO

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.477
TALK WITH -- THE CHAIR IN AND

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.379
YOU ON A SIDE BAR SEE THERE SOME

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:38.349
OTHER WAY TO GET OUT WHAT YOU'RE

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:40.651
HOPING TO GET OUT HERE MISTER

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:56.867
OBERNOLTE

00:43:59.603 --> 00:43:59.670
.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.538
BOBBY ON A LITTLE EARLIER THAN I

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:04.041
PLANNED ON BEING ON MY IS MY

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.642
CONCERN I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.244
WAS A THOUGHT THAT I'D HAD IT

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.614
WHEN -- YEAH I READ MISTER WANT

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.449
OR MISTER OBERNOLTE IS BILL IT'S

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:13.417
FUNNY WHEN I WAS DOING THE

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.085
CALCULATIONS I ACTUALLY FIND

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.387
FOUND MYSELF AND AND THINKING

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:17.788
THE OTHER TWO GOALS AND AND I

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.156
APPRECIATE.

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:21.625
THE THE AUTHORS GOALS -- OF OF

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.460
CLARITY BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:26.530
ACCURACY -- AND WE CAN'T

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.232
SACRIFICE ACCURACY.

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:32.436
IN IT FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY --

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.004
AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO VOTERS

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.305
TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATON

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.340
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET TO AN

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:37.875
ACCURATECALCULATION OF WHAT

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:38.709
THEY DO.

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.744
IN A BOND MEASURE WHICH IS WHY A

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:41.345
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.946
NOT DO THAT -- AND I DO NOT

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:45.349
SUPPORT THAT WHEN I WAS DOING MY

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.117
CALCULATION ACTUALLY. FOR NOT I

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:48.519
DON'T EXPECT THIS BUT HOW MUCH

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:49.453
OF GOING THE OTHER WAY.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.321
WHICH IS EVERYONE MAKE IT EASY

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:55.893
FOR VOTERS THEN DO IT PER DOLLAR.

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:56.760
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HOUSE IS

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:57.361
WORTH YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:57.961
CONDO IS WORKING ON THAT YOUR

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.063
PROPERTY IS WORTH.

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:00.697
AND YOU TO IF YOU HAVE THAT THE

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.599
PER DOLLAR CALCULATION ON THE

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:04.134
BALLOT THEN YOU JUST MULTIPLY IT

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.070
BY HOW MUCH YOUR PROPERTY IS

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.604
WORTH AND YOU GET TO A SIMPLE

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.807
CALCULATIONS ARE ACTUALLY CUTS

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:10.541
OUT THE STEPS.

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:11.408
THERE'S NO.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.576
YOU TAKE THE TOTAL TOTAL VALUE

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.644
OF YOUR PROPERTY YOU DIVIDE IT

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.212
BY SOME INCREMENT IN THE U.

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.447
MULTIPLIED BY NUMBER.

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:19.349
YOU JUST MULTIPLY IT BY A NUMBER --

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.351
AND SO I GUESS I'M ON OPEN TO

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.853
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT A

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.388
THOUSAND DOLLARS I STILL THINK

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.757
IT'S IT'S DIE I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.392
IT REALLY MAKES THINGS THAT MUCH.

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.461
EASIER FOR VOTERS -- I THINK

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.862
GOING TO A DOLLAR FRANKLY MAKES

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.430
IT IF THE GOAL IS EASE AN

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:34.531
ACCURACY.

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.500
THAN GOING TO A DOLLAR PROVIDES

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.368
EASE AND ACCURACY IT CUTS OUT

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:39.803
THE STEPS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.371
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:42.773
HOW MUCH YOU OWE IN A BOND

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.241
MEASURE AND I THINK THAT SHOULD

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:49.713
BE OUR GOAL -- AS GOVERNMENT SO --

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.416
THAT YOU KNOW I I I APPRECIATE --

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:54.251
YOU KNOW THE THE THE EFFORTS AT

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:56.753
AT YOU KNOW FINDING -- A

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.857
COMPROMISE I JUST I I JUST DON'T

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:02.159
KNOW THAT THAT REALLY HELPS --

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.494
AND AND SO I YOU KNOW TO ANSWER

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.028
THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF I

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:08.499
WOULD SUPPORT THAT -- I THINK I

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:10.601
THINK THE AUTHORS GOT TIME --

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:12.469
YOU KNOW I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.138
THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THIS --

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.073
GOING TO AFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.007
AND SO I THINK OF THE AUTHOR

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:19.409
WANTED. TO TO YOU KNOW.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.744
TURN THIS INTO A TWO YEAR BILL

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:22.479
AND AND GIVE MORE TIME FOR

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:23.714
CONVERSATIONS THAT SOMETHING

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.150
THAT CAN HAPPEN -- BUT I DON'T

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.384
KNOW IF ON THE SPOT RIGHT NOW ON

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.486
THE IN A PLACE TO SUPPORT A

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:30.420
THOUSAND DOLLARS VERSUS A

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:31.522
HUNDRED DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW.

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.589
THAT IT MAKES THINGS SO MUCH

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:33.924
EASIER AND I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.791
THINGS.

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:37.027
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES IT ANY

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:37.528
BETTER THAN THE CURRENT

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:40.164
SITUATION [inaudible]

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.867
PLEASE -- I'VE I MEAN I JUST

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.402
THINK IT DOES MAKE IT A LOT

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.070
SIMPLER AND THE MOST THINGS ARE

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:48.672
IN THE HUNDRED THOUSANDS MOST OF

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:51.008
THE YOU KNOW.

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:52.242
PROPERTY TAXES THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.744
DEAL WITH DEAL WITH YOUR HOME

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.579
AND OUR HOMES ARE ARE WORTH A

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.548
WHOLE LOT MORE THAN. HUNDRED

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:59.850
DOLLAR INCREMENTS NOW -- SO IT

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:01.652
IS TO ME IT IS IT DOES MAKE IT

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.620
SIMPLER AND A FOR IF THE IDEA TO

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:04.688
MAKE IT SIMPLER.

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:06.056
SO THE VOTERS CAN BETTER

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.624
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS IS

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:08.959
ACTUALLY GOING TO COST THEM.

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.394
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A REGIONAL

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.962
MEASURE WE CAN WORK THROUGH WHAT

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:12.863
THAT SHOULD BE.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.364
I MEAN THIS STILL GOT TO GO

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:17.401
THROUGH A LOT OF PROCESS AFTER

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:21.338
pWOULD ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.640
IT -- OBVIOUSLY AUTHOR CAN

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.242
DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO TERMS

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:26.476
OF MAKING IT TO BILL TO YOUR

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.612
BILL OR NOT BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.914
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROCESS TO GO

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:31.548
HERE AND WE CAN PROBABLY FIGURE

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:32.249
OUT.

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:33.817
YOU KNOW WHAT'S HE REMINDS ME OF

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.886
THE BIBLICAL.

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:36.320
YOU KNOW.

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:37.688
WHAT WAS IT SALAS KILLED AS

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.856
THOUSANDS AND DAVID IS KILLED AS

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:42.492
TENS OF THOUSANDS YOU KNOW?

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.427
WHICH ONE WE GET INTO YOU KNOW

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:47.464
IT WAS GOING 200-010-0001.

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.568
HUNDRED THOUSAND WELL YEAH. ONE

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.837
OF THOSE YOU KNOW -- BUT

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:55.973
WHATEVER THAT NUMBER RICHER'S

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:56.573
GET IT DOESN'T GO TO SYNAGOGUE

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.808
IN A WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS --

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:58.909
IT YEAH I THINK IT WOULD HELP

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:01.345
SIMPLIFY THEM FOR YOUR SON THAT

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:03.547
NOT DAMAGES EXAMINER.

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:10.554
ON I WAS GOING TERM A MICROPHONE

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:13.257
OFF.

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:15.993
WITH WHATEVER THAT IS QUESTION A

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.061
TAKEN US DOWN THE ROAD SORRY --

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:18.996
WHATEVER THE NUMBERS I THINK WE

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.864
CAN MAKE IT YOU KNOW SIMPLER FOR

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.000
VOTERS AND LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.936
TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:28.272
MISS GHANA I APOLOGIZE FOR FOR

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.139
BEING A LITTLE LATE TRAVELING

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.674
WITH THE KIDS IN THE MORNING IS

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:34.011
ABSOLUTELY NO JOKE -- BUT JUST

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.679
IF YOU COULD AT IN YOU MAY HAVE

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.114
ALREADY ADDRESSES BUT YOU GET

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.949
DRESSED A KIND OF WHAT I SHARED

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.517
WITH YOU IN MY TAXED -- THIS

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.319
MORNING I IN OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:43.654
WHICH WE DO WE NEED TO PUT

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.154
SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:45.822
SOMETIMES IT'S OUT OF NECESSITY

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.324
BECAUSE WERE IN A SIGNIFICANT.

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:48.859
ECONOMIC RECESSION I MEAN

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.360
OBVIOUSLY WE MITIGATE THOSE

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:50.961
ISSUES BY HAVING A RAINY DAY

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.496
FUND UP IN THE EVENT THAT WE

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:53.630
NEED TO PUT A BOND ON THE BALLOT

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:55.165
FOR A REALLY SIGNIFICANT REASON.

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:58.435
AND VOTERS ARE LOOKING AT THE

00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.403
NUMBERS DIFFERENTLY IN THERE

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:00.604
LOOKING AT A BIGGER NUMBER THIS

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.571
TIME THEY COULD DISCOURAGE

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.540
VOTERS FROM BEING ABLE -- TO GET

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:04.474
THEMSELVES TO POSITION WHERE

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:07.778
THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT MEASURE --

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:09.980
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT IT IS

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.248
AN ALREADY DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.616
GET DIFFERENT BOND MEASURES THAT

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:13.950
WE PLACE ON THE BALLOT WHETHER

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:14.951
TO TAX INCREASE FOR SPECIFIC

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.520
REASON BECAUSE WE NEED FUND

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:19.056
EDUCATION OR WHATEVER ELSE --

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.291
BUT I I I I WOULD WANT TO HEAR

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:23.060
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE IMPACT THAT

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.061
IT COULD HAVE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:25.262
COMES TO STUFF THAT THE

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:26.997
LEGISLATURE PUTS ON THE BALLOT.

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:27.731
FOR A VERY VERY LEGITIMATE

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.833
REASON AND THEN ALSO IF YOU

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.500
COULD JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH BECAUSE

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.169
I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IT --

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:35.772
ON THE YOUR AND YOUR NEED ARE

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:42.279
YOU YOU'RE PERCEIVED -- NEED FOR

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:43.447
THIS BILL SURE.

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:44.314
SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:45.315
I VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH THE

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.050
ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD MAKE

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:48.552
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET BOUGHT

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:49.920
MEASURES APPROVED.

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:53.023
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.825
IT VERY MUCH DOES NOT SUPPORT

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:56.727
THAT CONCLUSION BECAUSE THERE

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.061
BEEN MANY MANY STUDIES DONE ON

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.796
VOTER BEHAVIOR -- YOU KNOW

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:00.997
BECAUSE THEY ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:02.232
WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:03.567
INFLUENCING VOTER BEHAVIOR.

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.068
AND THE STUDIES SHOW OVER AND

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:06.636
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THAT THE

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.372
MORE CONFUSION THAT VOTERS HAVE

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.107
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON THE

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.508
MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO VOTE NO.

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:13.343
AND SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.978
IT'S CLEAR TO A VOTER.

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.646
NOT ONLY THE COST BUT ALSO THE

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:17.180
BENEFIT.

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:18.982
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.650
LIKELY TO GET TO A YES AND SO

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:21.585
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PROMOTE

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.387
THAT TRANSPARENCY I ACTUALLY

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.122
THINK THAT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.390
YES GAS POLITICAL CONSULTANTS

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.090
WILL TELL YOU.

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.859
IF YOU WANNA KILL AN INITIATIVE

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:30.193
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S AS CONFUSING

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.261
AS POSSIBLE AND YOU GO OUT THERE

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:32.596
YOU SOW CONFUSION AND THAT'S

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.997
THAT'S WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO GET

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.332
VOTERS TO VOTE NO. TO TRY TO

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.333
MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S SO

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.000
COMPLICATED THEY DON'T

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.201
UNDERSTAND IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:39.236
THEY'RE MOST LIKELY I CHECKED

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.303
THAT NO BOX.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.339
AND SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IN

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:43.106
SOME CASES THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:43.974
WITH.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.742
WITH IN OVER EXPRESSING THESE

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:46.410
RATES PER HUNDRED DOLLARS I MEAN

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.278
WE THE EXAMPLE WE WERE JUST

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:49.413
TALKING ABOUT A MINUTE AGO IF

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.648
YOU GOT A THREE AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:52.149
THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE.

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.917
AND THE AND THE TAXES EXPRESSED

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:56.086
AS A NICKEL PER HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:57.087
YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:58.155
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WHAT DO

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.222
INTERNAL CALCULATOR DO THAT

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.557
CONVERSION I MEAN MOST OF US

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.159
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT A BUNCH?

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.460
AND IN ON ANOTHER THING I THINK

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:04.494
IT'S WORTH SAYING ESPECIALLY

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:05.796
BECAUSE IT'S GERMANE TO OUR

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:06.797
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THEY

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.231
SHOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.200
PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FOUR

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:10.734
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:14.805
HE IS -- COMES FROM THE STUDY OF

00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:17.641
OF HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE.

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:18.809
WHICH IS AT A FIELD THAT THE

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:19.843
DECISION OFF MY COMPANY IS -- IN

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.078
A DOES WORK IN.

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.180
WHAT WE CALL THAT PROCESS ON

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.048
BOARDING PROCESS BETWEEN WHEN A

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.950
USER STARTS IN AND WHEN A USER

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.585
COMPLETES DOING WHAT'S SOMETHING

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.553
WE WANT THEM TO DO?

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:30.821
AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.189
THAT SAYS THAT EVERY SINGLE STEP

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.824
THAT YOU FORCE THE USER TO TAKE

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.492
BETWEEN THE BEGINNING A ON THE

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:37.727
OUT COOPER THE DESIRED OUTCOME

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:39.329
MAKES THEM LESS LIKELY TO FINISH

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:40.330
SO IF YOU.

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:41.932
TALK ABOUT IT THAT IN THIS CASE

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.433
IF WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO PER

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.768
FOR PEOPLE TO USE A CALCULATOR

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:46.136
THAT MEANS THAT EVERY.

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.404
NUMBER THAT THEY HAVE TO PUSH ON

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.538
THE CALCULATOR MAKES IT LESS

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.506
LIKELY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.941
FINISH AND MORE LIKELY THAT

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:51.575
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SAY TO

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.009
HECK WITH IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.377
HOW TO CALCULATE THIS RAID AND

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:56.580
SO THAT'S WHY THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:59.015
MARKETED AS TO WHY -- THOUSAND

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.550
IS BETTER THAN A HUNDRED AND A

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:01.618
HUNDRED THOUSAND IS BETTER THAN

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:02.152
THOUSAND BECAUSE I WOULD A

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.086
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THE

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.988
VOTER HAS TO DO TO GET IT TO GET

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:05.689
TO AN ACCURATE ANSWER.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:06.957
AND THIS IS AND THERE WASN'T A

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.558
SPECIFIC INCIDENT NO IT WAS JUST

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.093
YOUR THIS IS IN GENERAL TERMS

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.728
YOU EAT YOUR PURE AUTHOR HIS

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:12.796
BILL BECAUSE YOU PERCEIVE IT TO

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:13.630
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE VOTER TO

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:14.965
MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:15.799
OR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.100
THEY WANT. TO TAKE ON AND ON YES

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:20.170
AND AS I'M SURE MOST THE PEOPLE

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:20.770
ON THE COMMITTEE NO I I'VE A

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:26.309
LONG -- INTEREST IN THIS.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:26.943
IN THIS FIELD I'VE HAD A NUMBER

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:27.210
OF BILLS.

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:29.246
THAT THE IN THIS AREA IN FACT

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.413
THE REQUIREMENT TO PUTTHAT.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.548
OUR TAX RATE ON THE STATEMENT

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:32.482
CAME FROM THE BILL THAT I

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:33.817
AUTHORED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:35.986
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- I

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:36.920
HAVE A DEEP INTEREST IN ART

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:40.223
CONTINUED TO TO LOOK AT AS THE

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.825
REFORMS WE PUT IN PLACE HAVE OR

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.260
HAVE ROLLED OUT TO SEE WHAT

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.961
TWEAKS NEED TO BE MADE. TO MAKE

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.963
IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN THIS IS ONE

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.464
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:57.874
IDENTIFIED -- I FOUND MYSELF

00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:59.309
GOING BACK AND FORTH BEFORE

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.744
BEFORE YOU YOU ASKED FOR A

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.012
MEETING AND I HAD SAT DOWN AND

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:03.513
DID A LOT OF CALCULATIONS I WAS

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.814
GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH A

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:05.782
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:06.616
AND THEN WHEN I ACTUALLY SAT

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:07.984
DOWN AND DID IT THAT WAS WHEN I

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:09.252
CAME TO THE CAN I CAN'T READ MY

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:10.453
CONCLUSION WHICH I THINK IS THAT

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.988
THE DOLLARS EASIER FOR TRYING TO

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:12.756
MAKE IT.

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:16.393
EASY FOR VOTERS AND GET ACCURACY --

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:18.929
BUT IF.

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:22.232
YOU WANTED TO TO OFFER UP TO

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:24.100
CHANGE IT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS --

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:27.070
I WOULD NOT -- THAT WOULD

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.972
SUPPORT THAT.

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.774
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.709
THAT THAT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:33.243
OVER THE CURRENT STATE OF

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.745
AFFAIRS OF IN USING OUR EXAMPLE

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:36.680
THREATEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.247
DOLLAR HOUSE.

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.415
IF YOU EXPRESS A PER THOUSAND

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.349
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MULTIPLY

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.817
BY THREE SEVENTY FIVE I THINK

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.652
IT'S VERY CLEAR SO -- I WILL --

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:43.954
I WILL COMMIT TO TAKING THAT

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.056
AMENDMENT TO MAKE IT PER

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.857
THOUSAND DOLLARS CAD PER.

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:48.592

BE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU.

CALIFORNIANS AND SO -- THIS IS

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.031
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I DID

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.633

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.253
A LOT OF CANDIDATES THAT ARE

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.687
DETERRED FROM RUNNING FOR OFFICE

BECAUSE OF THIS AND A LOT OF

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.390
LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE YOUNG KIDS

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.758

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.880
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS I GO INTO HOW

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.482

PEOPLE IT ADD OUR CURRENT

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.285
POLICIES COULD COULD DETER YOUNG

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.020
PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO SEEK

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:44.654

APPRECIATE YOU WORKING ON THIS

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.192

IN A DIFFICULT ISSUE NOT NOT

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.028

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.714
GENERATION AND I DON'T THINK

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.149
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:16.018

FUND. TO HELP THEM PAY FOR THEIR

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.473
CHILD CARE -- SO FROM THAT

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.775
CIRCUMSPECT THAT FEEL LIKE ARE

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.343
WE KIND OF MAKING OURSELVES A

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.712
LITTLE BIT SPECIAL.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:20.149
IN THAT CASE -- AND AND I GET

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:21.650
THE GENDER PARITY ISSUE.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:22.651
BUT YEAH THERE'S ALSO THEIR

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.687
SINGLE DADS THE OTHERS MARRIED

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.755
MARRIED COUPLES THAT STRUGGLE TO

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.490
FIGURE OUT CHILD CARE -- TO IT'S

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.825
NOT JUST.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.026
YOU KNOW ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.595
AGAIN ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.698
ISSUES AND PERSONAL EXPENSES.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:38.367
THAT WE INCUR DOING THESE JOBS

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:39.935
SO WHY SHOULD WE CORDON OFF ONE

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:41.270
THING SO I STRUGGLE WITH THAT

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:44.473
PART A LITTLE BIT -- BUT THEN I

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.674
THINK THE SECOND PART IS IT

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.176
DOESN'T IS GET A LITTLE BIT

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.777
MESSY RIGHT BECAUSE HOW DO WE

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.379
DETERMINE LIKE OKAY THIS CHILD

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:54.016
CARE WAS FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.118
AS OPPOSED TO I'M JUST PAYING

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.953
YOUR CHILD CARE BILL.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.221
YOU KNOW FOR THE FULL YEAR

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:00.923
EVERYBODY HAS CHILD CARE THAT

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.892
THEY YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WELL

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:04.860
MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY BUT

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:05.794
EVERYBODY HAS CHILD CARE

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:08.030
EXPENSES OR A PARENT IS SPENDING

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.999
A LOT OF TIME.

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.934
TAKING OVER THAT ROLE AND IT'S

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:15.270
NOT AS AS I CAN PERSONALLY

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.672
ATTEST IS NOT AN EASY ROLE TO

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.173
FILL.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.709
EVERYBODY'S DOING THAT IN SOME --

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:25.047
CIRCUMSTANCE -- ARE WE GOING TO

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.049
USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO COVER WHAT

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.684
WOULD BE YOUR BASIC CHILD CARE.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:31.153
FUNDS BASIC CHILDCARE EXPENSES

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.089
JUST AS THEY WOULD BE EVEN IF

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:37.793
YOU WEREN'T ELECTED -- OR IS IT

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.795
ONLY FOR THE CAMPAIGN SOUNDS

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.230
LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ONLY.

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:44.433
FOR LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN RELATED.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.668
EXPENSES BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO ON

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.970
AUDIT THAT HOW DO YOU HOW TO HOW

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.472
DOES ONE DIFFERENTIATE THAT -- I

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.440
THINK THAT COULD BE KIND OF

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.709
MESSY AND DIFFICULT IN THE COULD

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:56.145
MAYBE MUDDY THE WATERS THE EVEN

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:58.747
MORE SO.

01:11:58.814 --> 01:11:59.748
ARE THESE THIS IS WHAT I'M KIND

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.383
OF STRUGGLING TO CONCEIVE ON

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:05.120
BOTH SIDES BUT I THINK THERE IS

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:09.358
SOME DIFFICULTY THERE.

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.959
WE GRAY POINTED OUT.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:11.493

THOUGHT TO IT TO EACH OF THEM.

AND YOU KNOW IT'S ELECTED

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:20.836
OFFICIALS WITH CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.109
IN A PART OF FUNDS THAT ARE THAT

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.811
ARE UNIQUE TO ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.245
RAN FOR OFFICE NOT AT NIGHT WHEN

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:32.981
HOUSING I AGREE -- BUT IT'S NOT

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.717
JUST FREE MONEY I MEET YOUR YOUR

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.385
YOUR REACHING OUT YOUR TO YOUR

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.419
YOUR POTENTIAL DONORS YOUR LOVE

ONES YOUR SUPPORTERS THAT YOU'RE

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:39.988

THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.568
SO I CAN'T GET THE MIND OF EVERY

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.703
DONOR -- THAT THAT WOULD

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.405
CONTRIBUTE TO CAMPAIGN FINE BUT

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.573
I I THINK GENERALLY THEY BELIEVE

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:57.873
IN.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.608
THE CANDIDATE THE SUPPORTING AND

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.609
WHAT THAT PERSON BE SUCCESSFUL

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:01.310
IN.

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:02.511
A TO ACCEPT BEARS TO REMOVE TO

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.512
MAKE THEM ABOUT ELECTED

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.080
OFFICIALS I THINK THEY WOULD.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.348
SUPPORT THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.516
THE HORSE IS ALREADY LEFT A

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.917
STABLE BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.385
AND THE STATE LEVEL ON WHETHER

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.787
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE CAMPAIGN

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:12.788
EXPENSE IT'S IT'S CLEARLY

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:17.826
APPROPRIATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.795
CONGRESS PEOPLE CAN DO THIS NOW --

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.063
DOESN'T VICE LETTER -- THAT SAID

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.397
YOU CAN DO IT AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:24.066
BUT AS A MISS MOBY INDICATED

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.601
THAT'S THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.201
AUTHORITY WE WANT TO BE MORE

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.336
CLEAR.

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.437
SAID IS NOT A LOT OF DEBATE ON

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:29.004
WHETHER IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.239
EXPENSE WERE JUST TRYING TO GET

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.707
THE THE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:32.941
AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:33.842
WILL CERTAINLY INCREASE GENDER

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:34.676
PARITY.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.879
BUT NOT ONLY GENDER PARITY IT'LL

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:37.846
IT'LL POP UP PROVIDE ENOUGH

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.548
THREE FOR MORE PARENTS TO BE AN

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.783
OFFICE AND THAT'S A GREAT THING.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.117
WHEN I WAS FIRST RUNNING FOR

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.418
CITY COUNCIL I SAW A LOT OF

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.220
RETIRED FOLKS OF FOLKS THAT

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:48.090
WITHOUT KIDS -- WEALTHIER FOLKS

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.825
AND I SAID WERE YOU KNOW I THINK

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:50.793
IT BECAUSE THERE IS A DOWN ON

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.461
THAT COUNCIL WITH YOUNG KIDS WHO

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.962
WHO I WAS.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:54.530
IN IT I BROUGHT A DIFFERENT

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.331
PERSPECTIVE ON AS WE REYES GET

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:57.266
TO MAKE IT POLICIES THAT AFFECT

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.967
FAMILIES WITH KIDS AND AND AND

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.335
AND OUR CHILDREN EVERY DAY AND

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.970
IT AND TO HAVE OUR OWN KIDS AND

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.071
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE I THINK

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.506
MAKES US BETTER POLICY MAKERS.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.275
IT'S OUR LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:07.709
WE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE WHEN

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.144
WE MAKE POLICY DECISIONS.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.345
AND ON YOUR LAST POINT THAT'S

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.447
EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT MISTER

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:13.448
THAT THE CHURCH ARE BERMAN IS

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:14.917

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:15.751

ON A WHAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.720

EVER RUN FOR OFFICE AND THEN YOU

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:22.391
START RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.692

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.561
YOUR YOUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.795
WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:27.362
BEFORE YOU START RUNNING FOR

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.697
OFFICE BUT IF YOU'RE FROM THE

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.875
OF WHEN I WENT TO WORK OR EVEN

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.576
WHEN I CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT'S

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:22.945
ALL PART OF A JOB AND SO.

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:24.613
I'M NOT SURE IF SOMETIMES WE TRY

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.348
TO TAKE ON TOO MUCH WITHOUT

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.883

PERIOD.

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:37.025
STRUGGLE EVERY DAY WITH MY STAFF

AT NIGHT.

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:43.298
ON WEEKENDS YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.400

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:46.668
OF THEM DON'T FALL INTO THE

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.403
CATEGORY EVEN DOING THE REGULAR

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:51.073

CHANGING THE FORMULA HERE AND A

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.455
WHOLE LOT OF THINGS SO.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.657
IT YOUR JOB IS A BIG ISSUE IN

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:10.359
THE STATE AND I'M NOT SURE IF

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.094
GIVING US LACK IS THAT GOOD

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.229
BECAUSE WE MAKE MORE THAN MOST

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:14.997
OF THE FOLKS WHO STRUGGLING

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:15.731
WHICH OUT HERE.

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.399
AT THE BECAUSE IT IS IN BETWEEN

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.301
GROUP OF FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.169

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.005
YOU KNOW TO DUBBED DON'T GET IN

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.473
THE PRE SCHOOL SET OF SUBSIDIZED.

THEY DON'T GET IN SOMETHING ELSE

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:26.742
AND SO THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.443
WITH CHILD HERE SO I'M I'M NOT

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.545
REALLY SURE ABOUT THIS I KNOW IN --

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:31.346
AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T GO INTO

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:32.848
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF EVERYTHING

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.449
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THAT'S

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:35.917
SOMEWHAT RELATED THAT WE'RE

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.586
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING.

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:38.220
FOR WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH NOW

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:41.023
OF A CANDIDATE NOT A CANDIDATE

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.958
BUT A AN OF CONGRESSMAN IN SAN

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.926
DIEGO WHO HAS PAID FOR

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.962
EVERYTHING -- YOU KNOW TUITIONS

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.163
AND THIS AND THIS AND THAT.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.731
AND SO AS A RESULT HE'S JUST

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.433
KIND OF ABUSE THE SYSTEM IN THE

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.634
WORST KIND OF WAY BUT YET HE

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:54.036
ARGUES THAT THIS IS A PART OF

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.604
HIS WOULD BE AS A DO BECAUSE HE

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.471
GOES TO WASHINGTON.

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:57.672
AND HIS KIDS NEED TO BE IN A

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:04.980
PRIVATE SCHOOL THE SECURED BLAH

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:05.247
BLAH BLAH.

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:06.915
SO YOU KNOW.

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:07.916
SO WE PLATE THE STATE OF MEAN

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:08.950
THEY PAID I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:09.918
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THOUSAND

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:10.552
AND PRIVATE SCHOOL JOB HERE FOR

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:10.886
HIS CHILDREN.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.754
AND THE END AND SO THAT'S GOOD

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:13.722
AND IT'S BEING LITIGATED IN THIS

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:14.523
BOOK OF THE BIBLE IN UP IN JAIL

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:15.257
BUT THAT AS WELL AS A HOST OF

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:15.624
OTHER THINGS.

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.559
SO I JUST I'M JUST HOPEFUL THAT

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.994
SOMEONE OF YOUR PRIVATE SOME

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.829
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:21.897
IS IMPLEMENTED.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.698
AND WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:26.635
ARE AS AS AS AS JUST PEOPLE WHO

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.703
LIVE AND WORK EVERY DAY -- IT IS

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.806
NOT EASY TO HAVE CHILDREN IT IS

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.274
NOT EASY TO HAVE TO OF FOR

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.475
CHOPPY AND CHOP HIS BECOME EVEN

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.143
MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.845
EVERY DAY FOR MOST FOLKS SO.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.380
YOU KNOW AND AND AND AND I AND I

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.548
AGREE THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.416
DOESN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF IT

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:42.217
AND I KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.118
SCHOOL BOARD.

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:44.286
WE HAVE PARENTS WHO CAME ALL THE

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:48.490
AND THE MAIN ISSUE WAS CHILDCARE

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.124
CHILDCARE CHILD.

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:49.925
I HAD THE SAME ISSUE I WAS A

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:50.659
YOUNG WITH AT THE TIME ON THE

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:51.927
SCHOOL BOARD I HAD CHOPPY ISSUES

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:52.761
TOO BUT I FIGURED OUT YOU KNOW

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:53.728
AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.330
ANYBODY ELSE'S JOB TO FIGURE IT

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:55.764
OUT.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.832
SO THAT I COULD COME TO SCHOOL

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.200
BOARD MEETINGS I DO THINGS AT

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.868
NIGHT THAT I HAD TO I HAD TO

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.470
FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF I HAD AND

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.737
MY HUSBAND HAD FIGURED OUT HE

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.072
WAS VERY ACTIVE IN SO WE

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:05.540
TRAVELED A LOT BUT THAT WAS

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:06.108
SOMETHING THAT WAS A PART.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:08.076
OF OUR LIFE IT BECAME AN EXPENSE

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.545
SO I I'M I'M I'M COME IN AND AND

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:10.745
BILL.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.114

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.381
THIS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BUT

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:14.483
I'M HOPING THAT.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:15.817
THERE'S SOME CLARITY THAT COMES

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.352
IN THAT MAKES SENSE FOR IT SO

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:18.820
THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH THIS.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.056
THIS THIS SELF FEELING THAT UP --

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.891
WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:23.992
ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT FOLKS

MAKE LOT LESS THAN WE DO.

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.268
WE HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY

IS THAT RIGHT IT'S NOT COUNTED

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:07.995

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:21.608
VERY.

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:22.943
PROCESS IS BASICALLY THE SAME

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.845
PROCESS THAT A COUNTY WHO WAS

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.213
CONNECTED TO THE STATEWIDE VOTER

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.548
REGISTRATION DATABASE ON

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:28.882
ELECTION DAY WOULD FOLLOW.

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:30.818
WE WOULD GO THROUGH CONFIRM THE

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.352
PERSON AS AN ELIGIBLE REGISTERED

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:33.287

RAPIDLY.

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:53.707
AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:54.241
YOU COUNT THAT PROVISIONAL

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:54.875

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:57.444
CORRECT VOTING PRECINCTS WE

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:59.112
COUNT THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT IF

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:00.814
THEY VOTED IN A PRECINCT THAT

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.716
MAYBE DID NOT HAVE ALL OF THE

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:04.017
ISSUES THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.652
TO VOTE ON THEY VOTED IN ONE

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:06.420
PART OF THE COUNTY AND THEY

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:07.688
LIVED IN ANOTHER.

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:09.890
WE WOULD DUPLICATE THE RACES

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.625
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO VOTE ON AND

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:11.792
CAL.

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:12.893
OKAY.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.895
BUT NOW WITH YOUR BILL.

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:16.330
IF YOU'RE CONNECTED COUNTY WE'RE

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:18.098
JUST GONNA DO ALL THAT

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:18.632
AUTOMATICALLY ESSENTIALLY

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:21.869
CORRECT.

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:24.404
AND WHAT IF.

01:42:24.471 --> 01:42:26.940
THE WHAT IS IT CALLED CALVERT'S.

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:28.876
BOCA VOEPEL.

01:42:28.942 --> 01:42:30.410
WHAT IF THE DATABASE IS WRONG

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:31.912
AND LIKE I THINK ONE OF THE WHAT

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.647
OPPOSITION IS PLAN AS THEY FOUND

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:34.882
INSTANCES WHERE?

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:36.984
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE REGISTERED

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.852
TO MULTIPLE ADDRESSES YOU KNOW

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:41.889
WHERE THERE'S DISPARITIES AND IN

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.323
THAT SYSTEM ITSELF I THINK WE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.059
ALSO HAD THE ISSUE A DMV.

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:47.361
REGISTRY IN PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:49.796
INELIGIBLE TO VOTE.

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.131
SO I'M ASSUMING.

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.666
AT SOME POINT DOES ONE INTO THE

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:54.034
SYSTEM OF THOSE BEEN TAKEN OUT

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.269
THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:57.004
DATABASE ITSELF RARE THERE'S

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.138
SOME THERE'S A VERIFICATION THAT

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:00.040
HAS TO BE DONE I WOULD POINT OUT

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:01.241
THAT UNDER THIS BILL.

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.410
VOEPEL IS THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM

WE USE IN OUR OFFICE.

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:06.713

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:15.222
