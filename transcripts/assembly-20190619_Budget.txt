SO THE BUDGET. DOES INCLUDE -- A SUSPENSION OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE -- BUT HAVE THE BILLING WAS WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN IN THIS BUDGET. SURE WOMAN I THINK I THINK. MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEE JUST A REPEAL OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW YOUR BY YOUR SUSPENSION WHAT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH REVEALING IT. INSTEAD JUST SUSPENDING IT ONCE AGAIN. SO THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY WAS ONE OF THE MANY GENERAL FUND -- PROVISIONS IN THIS BUDGET -- WHICH ARE I'M SCHEDULED TO SUNSET DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE BASED ON THE STATE'S OVERALL FISCAL PICTURE AT THAT TIME. AND SO -- THE ME REVISION INCLUDED -- YOU KNOW SUNSETS -- AT THAT TIME OF SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS IN THE MAYOR VISION IN THE FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT -- INCLUDES SUSPENSIONS AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THESE AUGMENTATIONS -- MAY BE ON TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF THE STATE'S. YOU KNOW GENERAL FUND CONDITION IS A SOLID SURE HIGH UNDERSTAND IT I I JUST WOULD PREFER THAT WE JUST FACE REALITY IN REPEAL IT RATHER THAN. EVERY DAY EVERY YEAR HAVING IT BE AN ISSUE BUT THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU START LITTLE BIT OF DISTRACTION HERE -- ANY -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YES MISS FRAZIER. AND I JUST WANNA SEGUE ON NOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AUGMENTATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENED.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- BERRY JUDGING FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION WE WE WANNA REALLY THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE STRONG WORK THAT THEY DID IN BEHALF OF PROVIDERS THIS YEAR -- WE KNOW THAT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHERE WE STARTED THIS YEAR -- HAPPY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MOVED WITH US OFF THEIR MAY REVISED PROPOSAL WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS THAT BECAUSE THE NEED IS IMMEDIATE NOW WE'RE WAITING SIX MONTHS TO GET RELIEF AS WELL AS HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUNSET ON THE BACK AND THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL. TALKED ABOUT PLENTY -- ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE FOR A LIMITED TIME WOULD HAVE HOPE TO SEEN SOME OF THOSE OTHER RECESSION OR CUTS BE INCLUDED AS WELL BUT ON THE WHOLE HOPEFULLY IS A GOOD FIRST STEP. THE LAST POINT ONE MAKE IS ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REGARDING THE RATE STUDY IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW THAT'S OF HUGE CONCERN TO OUR COMMUNITY -- THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT UNLESS WE TAKE CONCRETE STEPS IN THE FUTURE -- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ASSEMBLY STAFFS GREAT WORK ON THEIR TOTAL BILL LANGUAGE ON THAT POINT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR TEN MEMBERS THERESA ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARC IN YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION WE WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION AND DELIBERATING THE FUTURE OF A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- THE ASSEMBLY SUB BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE DDS RATE STUDY AND HEARD PUBLIC COM AT LENGTH REGARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY AND COMPREHENSIVE RATE REFORM. I'M ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HOLDEN FRASER THINK VERY MUCH TO EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON THIS BUT THEY CARRIED A PROPOSAL FOR A PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DOWN PAYMENT FOR STABILIZE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY MANY OF THE MEMBERS -- MAKE COMMENTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAKE COMMENTS EMOTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY -- ARE COLLECT IT'S ALL OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S QUALITY AND ACCESS TO QUALITY SERVICES. THE RESULTS ARE INVESTMENTS IN -- POLICY CHANGES THAT WILL PROVIDE CRITICALLY NEEDED TEMPORARY RELIEF TO SOME OF THE SERVICES IN CRISIS. HOWEVER IT MUST BE ONLY -- THE FIRST STEP WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF CALIFORNIANS WITH IDT WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES MANDATES FOR STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS AROUND COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. BEGINNING IN THE SUMMER -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ACTIONS NOT DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BOTH THE SET THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE PASSED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE ACTION TOWARD RIGHT REFORM NEXT YEAR. IN THE BUDGET AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT IN THIS BILL WE CONTINUE TO LOOK -- TO THE COMMITTEES ON OUR LEGISLATIVE CHAMPIONS TO LEAD US TOWARD THAT REALIZATION NEXT YEAR COUPLE SPECIFIC POINTS ABOUT THE TRAILER BILL FIRST WE THINK THE COMMITTEE ON THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR ITS WORK ON SUSPENDING THE FOURTEEN DAY. HOLIDAY SCHEDULE -- WE REALLY REALLY WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE HALF DAY -- AS WELL NEXT YEAR AND ECOND THIS BILL QUALIFIES -- RATE INCREASES AND WHO -- DOESN'T IT'S NOT BASED ON THE RAFT -- I'M SORRY -- THE BILL CODIFIES WHO GETS RATE INCREASES AND WHO DOESN'T BASED ON THE DRAFT RATE STUDY THEREFORE AS THE RATE MODELS ARE REVISED AND FINALIZED IN OCTOBER. THESE RATE INCREASES MUST BE REVISITED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET OR EARLIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- CARL LUNDEN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING. PEOPLE WITH -- INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES AUGUST ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES AND JUST ADD A COUPLE OF BRIEF ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- FIRST I DO AND I THINK -- IN PARTICULAR IN THIS HOUSE MISTER FRAZIER MR HOLDEN A MISTER MATHIS. FOR ALL OF THEIR DEDICATED ADVOCACY ON THIS AND REALLY PUSHING. AND WE DO WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS LEGISLATURE FOR STANDING THE ADMINISTRATION UP A LITTLE BIT AND CALLING FOR MORE BROAD BASED APPROACH TO FUNDING. THIS COMMUNITY THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THAT WAS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL STEP. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE FELL SHORT -- I THINK THAT PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE THAT THE RATE STUDY. YOUR SORTER REFERRING TO THIS CONVENIENTLY IS THE BASIS OF THE PROPOSALS WERE MAKING BUT IT SEEM TIME IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THE RATE STUDY AND REALLY USE THAT. IT ALSO CALLS FOR ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING NOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION -- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY YEAR TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT CALLS FOR ONE POINT TWO BILLION FUNDING. SO WE NEED EVERYBODY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS  WORK IN PROGRESS -- THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS. WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT SOME OF THE RECESSION ERA. CUTS THAT DATE ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ARE STILL IN PLACE INCLUDING THE HALF THE BILLING. A RESTRICTION INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION OF FUNDING FOR SOCIAL RACK IN CAMP PROGRAMS AND I WANT TO NOTE ON THAT. THOSE PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR HIT PEOPLE WHO ARE THE POOREST IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD SON WHO'S AT CAMP. ODDLY ENOUGH RIGHT NOW I CAN AFFORD TO SEND IN THEIR BROTHER MANY PEOPLE THAT CANNOT. IN UNLESS WE RESTORE THAT DEMI DEMI DENY THEM OF THE ONE OPPORTUNITYMIGHT HAVE FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION. AND GETTING OUT OF THEIR OWN WORLD EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S IT THAT'S IT CUT THE DIRECTLY CORRELATES BACK. AS DIRECTLY AS IT CAN BE TO THE RECESSION YEAR THAT WE HAD IN THE STATE WE ARE NOT IN A RECESSION TODAY. SO TO KEEP THAT CUT IN PLACE WE THINK IS A A REAL MISSTEP. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT GET NOTHING UNDER THIS BUDGET NO INCREASE. AND I KNOW WE HELP THEM HARMLESS WE AGAIN USE THE RATE STUDY JUSTIFY. WHY THEY'RE GETTING NOTHING AND THE THEORY WAS THAT THERE MAY BE BEING OVER PAY TODAY? BUT I CAN TELL YOU THOSE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING ABOUT IS LENA BASIS AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. YEAH AND THEY STILL FACE ALL THE COST PRESSURES. THAT ARE GONNA BE. BEFALL THEM DURING THE YEAR HEAD MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE GOES UP BY 8% OVER 8% CHEN MY FIRST THEY'RE GONNA BE SUBJECTED TO THAT. THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO ALL THE OTHER COST PRESSURES. THE END THIS STUFF HAS TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR TO CONSIDER PUTTING AN EVEN MODEST RELIEF. FOR THOSE PROGRAMS SO THEY FEEL LIKE YOU THEIR PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE BEING LISTENED. TO AND OTHERWISE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MAKE FEW COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS. ON ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SING THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO S. B. IN. NINETY SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT. A GOOD AFTERNOON EVELYN SUSANA DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I'M I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER -- OR GO OVER THIS THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL -- THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDES FOR ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BOTH CAL PERSON CAL STIRS TO PAY DOWN RETIREMENT LIABILITIES AND ALSO TO PROVIDE GREAT BELIEF FOR SCHOOLS PENSION COSTS. THE SECRETARY CHANGES IN THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PAYMENTS. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU ANY -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] SB. NINETY OKAY SEEING NONE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON SB. NINETY OKAY THANK YOU REALLY WANT TO THE S. B. ONE OH SIX ON BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. THANK YOU CARLA BECAUSE THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE BILL PROVIDES A FEW CORRECTIONS REFLECTING THE FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT -- DOES A FOR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE SUBSIDIES AS WELL AS HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING -- IT ALSO ADDS CLARIFICATIONS IN PROVISIONS -- INCLUDING SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE AND WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THOSE REPORTS -- FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL'S PROVIDING APPROPRIATIONS RELATED TO THE BUDGET BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS INSTRUMENT. I THANK YOU MR CHAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES SO THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD PROVIDE THOSE SUBSIDIES AT INCREASED INCOME LEVELS UP LEVEL. WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY. I'M WONDERING WHAT'S THE **** EVIDENCE WE HAVE THAT PROVIDING SUBSIDIES TO THOSE -- INCOME RANGES IS EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING INSURANCE COVERAGE -- UNDERSEA BERMAN FINANCE I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE. A LOT IN TERMS OF STATISTICS IN FRONT OF ME TODAY THE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF ON THIS BUT YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING AT LOWER INCOMES THAT YOU'VE GOT A MUCH MORE GENEROUS SUBSIDY WITH RESPECT THAT THAT FEDERAL LEVEL WITH RESPECT TO CAPPING THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME -- THAT PEOPLE NEED TO SPEND IN ORDER TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE AND THERE'S THERE IS NO SUCH CAPEN SO THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE CONFERENCE COMPROMISED PROPOSAL -- WOULD RESULT IN PEOPLE NOT SPENDING MORE THAN ABOUT 18% OF THEIR INCOME -- ON ON ON HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH THE EXCHANGE -- AND THE TO GIVE YOU A KIND OF A SENSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE PROPOSAL'S EVOLVED IT MAY REVISION AT THAT FUNDING LEVEL THAT WAS AROUND 25% OF OF SOMEONE'S INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE. SO -- THAT THE PROPOSAL'S DESIGNED TO REALLY -- REDUCE -- THE UNINSURED RATE BY BY MAKING THE COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE IN THAT MIDDLE INCOME RANGE WHERE THERE AREN'T SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE TODAY. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT TO THE CRUX OF OUR DISAGREEMENT WHICH IS THAT -- I THINK THAT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO INCREASE COVERAGE RATES -- AND EAT THE YOU SAID THAT THE GOAL WITH THIS LEGISLATION IS. TO US CAP THE PERCENTAGE OF SOMEONE'S INCOME THAT THEY SPEND ON HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE I DISPUTE THAT GIVING SOMEONE A SUBSIDY OF INTO A SIX ARE PERCENT OF THE FPL. THAT SO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR THREE ACTUALLY FAMILY. THREE SO I DON'T THINK THAT GIVING A SUBSIDY TO PEOPLE IN THOSE RANGES IS GONNA WHAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THEM GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND I'M NOT GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE -- AND AND YOU KNOW THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND I REALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A SEPARATE TRAILER BILL THAT IMPLEMENTS THE MANDATE AND THE PENALTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY GOES TO FUND. THIS EXPANSION OF SUBSIDY BUT THE PEOPLE IN THOSE THE PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING THE PENALTY TO FUND OF THESE SUBSIDIES ARE IN A MUCH LOWER. INCOME RANGE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MOST OF THEM SO AND TO ME IT MAKES NO SENSE TO TAKE MONEY FROM SOMEONE MAKING THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE MAKING AND AND I GUESS THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE. THANK YOU MISTRESS. THANK YOU MISTER. IN RELATION TO THE APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATED. TO FUNDING FOR RAPID RE HOUSING ON PAGE. TWENTY TWO I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESS AND HOT HOUSING AND SECURE. A FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE KNOWN THE TO DO THE TO TRADITIONAL TERMS AND VIEWS ON STUDENT HOMELESSNESS WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE OR OUR CAMPUSES THE FULL SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGES. FACED BY OUR STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING AND SECURITY. THE OBSTACLE. THE OBSTACLES TO IDENTIFYING STUDENTS FACING THESE CHALLENGES HAMPERS EFFORTS TO LINK STUDENTS WITH FUNDING AND PROGRAMS THAT CAN ASSIST THEM OUT OF THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION. I WANT TO COMMEND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF. THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING THIS IMPORTANT DEFINITION THAT CAPTURES THE VARYING VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ERA. OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. BETH CAPELL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA IN ANSWER TO MISTER OBERNOLTE IS QUESTION WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEPARATE. MODELING EFFORTS USING MY CHRISTIAN RELATION MODELS DEVELOPED BY ECONOMIST AND HEALTH POLICY EXPERTS. THAT INDICATE THAT THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED BY A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADDED FUNDING THAT IS IN THIS -- BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO PAY FROM AS MUCH AS THEIR INCOME. I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY IN THEIR EARLY SIXTIES LIVING ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN AFFORD TO SPEND 40% OF THEIR INCOME JUST ON THE PREMIUM FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. WE'VE BEEN PLEASED TO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THESE EFFORTS UP TILL NOW AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THAT WE ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY. IN ASSURING THAT THOSE WHO ARE UNDER A 138% OF POVERTY WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON USUALLY BECAUSE THERE CARE GIVERS AND A FAMILY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE ALL WILL NOW PAYS ZERO PREMIUMS AND SO WE THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ALIGNER COMMENTS OF HEALTH ACCESS WE HAVE PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE -- INCREASE ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THOSE UNDER ONE THIRTY EIGHT AND DATA MODELING FROM CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES IT WILL. INCREASE COVERAGE FOR THIS GROUP THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SING THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO A. B. NINETY ONE SLASH A. B.. TWO ONE SEVEN THE LOOPHOLE CLOTURE AND SMALL BUSINESS AND WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER BERMAN FINANCE CANNELLA GO TO THE MICROPHONE ON THANK YOU. I'LL DESCRIBE THIS ITEM IN BRIEF I KNOW -- MISTER CHAIR AT BREACH DE AT REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE A COUPLE DAYS AGO ON THESE ITEMS SO WILL RUN FOR VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE FIRST THING THAT THIS BILL DOES IS EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BY A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT FOCUSES ON THREE MAJOR CHANGES THE FIRST IS IMPLEMENTING A NEW YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT ANY HOUSEHOLD IF THEY HAVE A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX THEY WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE SECOND ITEM IN THIS BILL IS INCREASING THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS MEANS THAT ANYBODY IN THE FAMILY MAKING FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH COMES TO ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WORKING HOUSEHOLD WILL BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THIS CREDIT. AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT THIS BILL DOES ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT SIDE IS INCREASE THE BENEFIT FOR FAMILIES THAT MAKE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS VERY GENEROUSLY TILTED TOWARD FAMILIES BETWEEN -- ZERO AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE THOSE ARE LOWEST INCOME WORKING FAMILIES BUT THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FOR THOSE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAX CONFORMITY PROVISIONS. THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT OFTEN WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSES A TAX BILL THE STATE TAKES CONFORMING ACTIONS EITHER BECAUSE THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ERRORS IN ANY PENALTIES THAT GO WRONG WITH THOSE ERRORS. THEY REDUCE THE BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH TWO SETS OF RULES OR THEY MAKE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SENSE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY ARE PRUDENT AND LOGICAL. SO THIS BILL UNDERTAKES A NUMBER OF THOSE CONFORMITY ITEM SOME OF WHICH COST REVENUE SOME OF WHICH RAISE REVENUE. ITEMS THAT COST REVENUE INCLUDE A LIMITATION ON LOSSES FOR NON CORPORATE TAXPAYERS TO OFFSET OTHER INCOME THIS ONLY AFFECTS TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NON CORPORATE PERSONAL INCOME TAX THAT PERSONAL INCOME EACH YEAR. IT ALSO INCLUDES A LIMITATION ON A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE DEFERRAL. REMOVES THAT OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACK. CAPS TO DEDUCTION AT THE ICY PREMIUMS FOR BANKS LIMITS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR CIOS WHEN THEY MAKE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL OFFICE OF A CUP OR A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS RELATED TO PARTNERSHIP TERMINATION RULES AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. ON THE ITEMS THAT COST REVENUE BUT WE THINK MAKE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA THREE IN PARTICULAR ONE AND NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT MAKE IT EAT MUCH EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES FOR THEIR ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS. RAISING THE THRESHOLD FROM GOING FROM CASH TO ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING FROM FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WILL COST -- THE STATE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OUR ECONOMY. AS A CONFORMITY ITEM. WE ALSO -- EXPAND THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO ABLE ACCOUNTS THESE ARE ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACCOUNTS PROVIDING A HIGHER THRESHOLD AS WELL AS WELL AS ROLL OVERS FROM. FIVE TO NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR THE CARE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY EXPANDING STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS TO EXCLUDE FROM INCOME WHEN A STUDENT LOANS FORGIVEN ON ACCOUNT OF DEATH OR TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY. SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN PROVISIONS AND MISTER CHAIR HAPPY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER OVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONFORMITY ITEMS. THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGE IS WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IMPLEMENTED THE ROLE THE PHASE OUT OF LIKE KIND EXCHANGES FOR MOST PROPERTY THEY ALSO ADDED A BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISION. SO THAT -- JUST KIND OF REPLACE WHAT THEY WERE TAKING WAY WITH. WITH ROLLING BACK THE OKAY HE'S NOW WE ARE CONFORMING TO THE ROLLBACK OF THE LIKE ANY CHANGES WE WERE WE ARE NOT CONFORMING TO BONUS DEPRECIATION WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME CAN YOU TELL ME WHY. THAT DECISION WAS MADE. YES SO THE GENERAL APPROACH THE TAXING FOR MANY PACKAGES IS NOT A FULL CONFORMITY BUT ONLY THOSE ITEMS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVE MAKES SENSE SO WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGE IS. THIS BASICALLY ALLOWS. CORPORATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE CHANGES TO DEFER OR SHELTER THE TAX GAIN ON THAT ASSET WHEREAS WHEN YOU YOU ARE ICE SELLING A CAPITAL ASSET WE GENERALLY HAVE TO PAY TAX AT THE TIME OF THAT TRANSACTION. AND SO YOU ARE RIGHT THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY PAIRED IT WITH BONUS DEPRECIATION -- BUT THE FACT IS SOME OF THE POLICIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL MADE SENSE AND SOME DID AND FOR EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CUT THEIR CORPORATE TAX RATE AS PART OF THEIR TAX PACKAGE WE HAVE CORPORATE TAXATION IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO CUT THAT RATE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENACTED CHANGES TO THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION -- IN TERMS OF THE VALUE OF THE HOME WE DON'T CONFORM TO THAT -- THAT FEDERAL TAX START THE FEDERAL TAX BILL MADE CHANGES FOR REGARDING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION WE HAVE LOCAL YOU KNOW SOME STATE TAXES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN CONFORM TO THAT PROVISION AS WELL SO. WITH REGARD TO THE BIKE KIND EXCHANGES THAT PROVISION MADE SENSE TO US WE DID INCLUDE A CARVE OUT FOR PERSONAL INCOME TAXPAYERS WITH INCOMES. OF LESS THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR MARRIED HOUSEHOLDS BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT MADE SENSE TO INCLUDED EXPENSING OR BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISION AS WELL. OKAY WELL KNOWN AS WE WERE NEVER TALK ABOUT 1100% CONFORMITY TO FEDERAL TAX LAW. BUT CERTAINLY FOR GOING TO CONFORM A PROVISION TO FEDERAL TAX LAW I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO CHERRY PICK AND SAVE WE'RE GONNA CAR ABOUT THAT. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE THE PARTS THAT INCREASE STATE REVENUE AND WE GONNA CARVE OUT THE PARTS THAT DECREASE STATE REVENUE. AND I DISAGREE WITH YOUR ASSERTION THAT -- THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE BUT FOR BUSINESSES. IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS A PIECE OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT. AND IT'S FULLY DEPRECIATED AND YOU BUY A NEW PIECE OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT TO REPLACE IT UNDER THE OLD LAW YOU COULD CALL THAT LIKE AND TO CHANGE AND NOT AND NOT HAVE TO RE CAPTURE A BUNCH OF DEPRECIATION ON THAT ASSET. IN -- WITHOUT BONUS DEPRECIATION WITH THE ACTION THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO TAKE YOU WELL AND SO I MEAN THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE I'LL GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ABLE ACCOUNTS. AND ARE CONFORMING TO FEDERAL LAW TO BE ABLE TO ROLL OVER A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN A COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN INTO AN ABLE ACCOUNT WHICH I THINK IS GREAT. BUT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO CONFORM FEDERAL TAX TO FEDERAL TAX LAW. THAT PERMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. SO AGAIN THE QUESTIONS WILL WIRE WITH CHERRY PICKING AND SAYING -- WE'RE JUST GONNA CONFORM THIS THIS AND THIS BUT NOT THIS IN THIS AN ENEMY ON THE FIVE TWENTY NINE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SINGLE. BIGGEST THING THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO INCREASE COLLEGE SAVINGS RATES AND YET WE'RE NOT CONFORMING THAT SO WHY NOT. SO ON THE FIVE TO NINE I NEED TO LOOK THAT UP SIR YOU SAYING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWS TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO A FIVE TWO NOTES CORRECT. YEAH THE I I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS PART OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT BUT IT WAS IT WAS IT NO WAS NOT IT WAS OKAY IT REALLY IS ALREADY RIGHT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A PROVISION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT THE STATE IS NEVER COME RIGHT. RIGHT YEAH. BUT MY QUESTION IS WE HAVE A WIFE OR CONFORMING SOME OF STATE LAW. ON FIVE TWENTY NINTHS TO FEDERAL LAW WHY NOT CONFORM ALL OF THEM. WELL I I I'D SAY -- IN ORDER TO TO HAVE THESE ACCOUNTS WORK PROPERLY DEDUCTIBILITY IS NOT. IS NOT ESSENTIAL BUT HAVING THIS THE INCOME LIMITS AND HAVE THE THE AMOUNTS THAT THAT ARE CONSIDERED QUALIFIED THAT IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO HAVING THESE -- TO HAVE THESE WORK BETWEEN FEDERAL AND SAY YOU WANT HAVE THIS THOSE SAME RULES BUT AS FAR AS DETECTABILITY THAT ISN'T ESSENTIAL. TO TO IT TO HAVE THE THE I I GUESS WHEN ONCE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA LAWS. WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAWS YOU NOW OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH. WITH THE OTHER LAW. OKAY AND AND AND THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WE WERE KIND OF CONFORM YOUR NOW DEDUCTIBILITY IS JUST A MATTER OF WHEN I MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO I GET TO TAKE A DEDUCTION [inaudible] FOR OUR OKAY. I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING YOUR POINT BUT I THE SENSING THAT WE'RE DISAGREEING AND SEVEN I'M GONNA MOVE ON BUT THEY'LL LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO TAKE SOME OF THIS REVENUE. AND MAKE THOSE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS -- CONTRIBUTIONS DEDUCTIBLE BECAUSE EVERY I MEAN WE EVERY COUPLE HERE'S SOMEONE IN THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSES MAKING FIVE TWENTY NINE CONTRIBUTIONS DEDUCTIBLE AND EVERY YEAR GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS AND EVERY YEAR IT GETS HELD AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE REVENUE LOSS AND SO WE ARE. WAS OUR GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF THIS REVENUE AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. AND WHEN WE'RE NOT DOING IT SO THAT THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION WITH THIS CONFORMITY BILL I THOUGHT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE'RE CHERRY PICKING WE'RE SAYING. WE'RE ONLY GOING TO TAKE THE CONFORMITY ACTIONS THAT INCREASE STATE REVENUE AND WE'RE NOT TAKING THE ACTIONS THAT WOULD DECREASE STATE REVENUE. AND I WE WE JUST MISSED A BIG OPPORTUNITY THERE [inaudible] THANKS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU DON'T MY COMMENTS ARE RELATED -- TO THE EXCLUSION OF I TEN WORKING TAX PAYERS FROM THE THE CURRENT -- CALAIS T. I. T. C. PROPOSAL I KNOW I BROUGHT THIS UP AND RUNNING TAX. REVENUE TAXED -- TO YOU -- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A TRADE OFF RIGHT TRYING TO INCREASE -- THE INCOME THE MAXIMUM INCOME -- TO THIRTY THOUSAND BUT I THINK IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT -- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO BRING UP I MEAN I AM SURE ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS -- THAT THE DISPLACEMENT OF EXCLUDING I TEN FILERS FROM QUALIFIED FOR THE E. I. T. C. CREDIT THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO JUST KIND OF SEGUE ON WHAT MISTRAL OBERNOLTE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING LIKE. KIND EXCHANGES WE HAVE A OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE NOW -- IN FORCING -- FOURTEEN THOUSAND GVW TRUCKS HAVE TO BE WERE A COMPLETELY REPLACED BY BUSINESSES THIS YEAR. WHO HAVE FULLY AMORTIZED THEM INCLUDED DEPRECIATION? AND HAVE TO BUY NEW RIGS. APPROACHED ME A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR RATE. SMALL BUSINESS CAN'T AFFORD THIS AND NOT. BE ABLE TO GET THESE DEDUCTIONS GOING FORWARD -- AND AGAIN WE HAVE AN AGENCY IS REQUIRING THIS BUT THE NO. THIS WILL BE A DETRIMENT FOR THEM MOVING FORWARD. UNLESS THEY BUY SOMETHING USED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN OR BETTER. SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AGENCIES DISCUSS. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE IN THE REAL WORLD. BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO HAMPER REINVESTMENT OR WILLINGNESS TO GO FORWARD AND ENGAGE IN THEIR BUSINESS -- I REALLY THINK THIS IS HARMFUL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- I WAS THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR ONE TIME I HAD ONE OF THESE TRUCKS. AND I GUARANTEE YOU I COULDN'T AFFORD TO REPLACE AND NOT GET THE DEDUCTION. SO I'M SAYING. THANK YOU. FOR I WONDER IF YOU COULD -- JUST EXPLAIN A TOUCH ON OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WHAT HAPPENED TO IT -- CERTAINLY WITH -- ARE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN CRISIS FACING THE STATE -- IT WOULD BE KIND OF A WHAT WAITED TO ALLOW MORE CAPITAL TO FLOW INTO AREAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND BE BUILT SO I WAS PLANNING IF YOU COULD JUST TOUCH ON THAT FOR A MOMENT. YES I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT AND IT'S JANUARY PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADMINISTRATION HAD EXPRESSED INTEREST IN WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON AT PROPOSAL ON OPPORTUNITY ZONES. NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETE CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ON PROJECTS IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT EITHER -- HELP WITH GREEN JOBS OR HELP WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING SICKLY TECHNOLOGY AND HOUSING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DESIGNATED I THINK WAS -- EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE SUCH ZONES ACROSS THE STATE -- WHERE THESE PROJECTS COULD TAKE PLACE -- BETWEEN JANUARY AND TODAY IN JUNE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH A FINAL AGREEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- AND SEEING IF WE CAN WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. IF I IF I JUST A LITTLE MORE QUESTION WHY WOULD NOT WHY WOULD WE JUST COMPLETELY CAN FORM AND AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS NOT SPECIFIC TO ONE THING BUT ALLOW IT. TO BE USED MORE WIDELY. SO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS SUGGESTED THAT THE FEDERAL PROPOSAL HAD A LOT OF BENEFITS BUT ALSO RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS BUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS WORK. IF IT'S CASTING TOO WIDE AND THAT WE MAY BE CUTTING TAXES FOR PROJECTS THAT MIGHT ALREADY BE HAPPENING ANYWAY AND DON'T NECESSARILY NEED AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE -- AND SO WE'RE DEPRIVING THE STATE OF REVENUE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS WITHOUT NECESSARILY SPRING YOU ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ANOTHER CONCERN WAS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS TAX BENEFIT MIGHT BE BENEFITING PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ARE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE PUTTING OUR STATE DOLLARS MIGHT NOT MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THEN FINALLY AND WITH REGARD TO PROJECT AREAS -- IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO THE ADMINISTRATION AS IDENTIFIED HOUSING AS WELL AS CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES TO KEY AREAS -- WERE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DEFINE THOSE ARE LOOK AT THOSE DEFINITIONS BUT WE WONDERED WHETHER A CLEAN CONFORMITY MIGHT CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS IN COST AND THE BENEFITS THAT THE STATE RECEIVES AS A RESULT. THANK YOU MISS WORKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH A SEVEN MEMBER REVERSES COMMENTS -- I'M YOU KNOW EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST EXPAND IN -- YEAH TO SEE I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET HAS IN THAT. HUGE IMPACT ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES -- AND BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS I DO -- AND DISAPPOINTED OTHER THE AYE TO COMMUNITIES NOT -- EXCLUDED -- AND WHAT MY HOPE MY STRONG HOPE WE WOULD THAT WE COULD RECTIFY THIS AND THE FUTURE SETTINGS ARE CRITICAL OF THESE ARE CRITICAL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT I THINK SHOULD BENEFIT FROM. FROM THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER KARGER. YEAH AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES IS THE THE ABILITY TO DEDUCT NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES RIGHT. AND SO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME IT REALLY THE CHANGES. THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CAP -- IT'S JUST A CHANGING CHANGING WHAT THE CAP IS ON BUSINESS NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSS DEDUCTIONS RIGHT CAN YOU. WHAT IS IT NOW WHAT WOULD IT CHANGE TO UNDER THIS SIZE NOT SURE IF THEY WERE PRE IF THERE WAS PREVIOUSLY A CAT THERE WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY A CAP ON DEDUCTION AGAINST OTHER INCOME? OKAY. AND AND SO YEAH SO SO THERE IS NO CAP PREVIOUSLY WHICH MEANT THAT. NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MADE WAGES ARE CAPITAL ONE TIME OR INTEREST INCOME -- IF YOU HAD A BUSINESS LOSS THAT EXCEEDED BACK THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY ANY TAXES ON THAT WAGES SO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID WAS SAY THAT -- UNLESS IT'S MORE THAN UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE YOU CAN STILL DO THAT BUT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN THAT TAX YEAR AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO CARRY IT FORWARD. TO A FUTURE YEARS THE FEDERAL ALSO DISALLOWED KERRY BACKS WHICH ARE BILL PROPOSES CONFORMING TO AS WELL. RIGHT SO YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO DEDUCT UP. TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF LOSSES RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF INCOME FIRST OF ALL. THAT'S CORRECT FOR MORE -- IN IT TO DEDUCT THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IF YOU'RE MARRIED IT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S CORRECT. OF LOSSES -- I BELIEVE PREVIOUSLY WASN'T THERE A RULE ABOUT YOU CAN ONLY DEDUCT UP SO THIS IS ACTUALLY. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE NEW ROLE SO -- WHAT THE PREVIOUS ROLE WAS BEFORE THAT DAY TAX REFORM BILL PASSED IN DC WAS? YOU CAN ONLY CARRY FORWARD UP TO TWENTY YEARS I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT BUT YOU CAN DEDUCT ALL OF THE INCOME ALL ALL THE ALL THE LOSSES THAT YOU HAD. YOU COULD YOU COULD USE UP ON YOU COULD OFFSET A 100% OF YOUR INCOME IN THE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THAT'S RIGHT IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR YES AND AND KERRY THOSE. FORWARD YEAH SO THAT THAT NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS AND NOW CHANGED TO WHERE THERE'S NO TWENTY YEAR TIME LIMIT IT'S NOW ON LIMITED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- BUT FOR ON YOUR FEDERAL TAX RETURN YOU CAN ONLY OFFSET NOT PROPOSING TO CONFORM TO THAT AND THAT GOES THE NEXUS SO. YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THOSE LOSSES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE -- YOU JUST TAKEN OVER TIME. YES -- UNDER OUR PROVISIONED -- AND ANY GIVEN YEAR YOU IT'S CAPPED AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE BUT BACK IN THE CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED FORWARD. RIGHT. AND THAT'S IN ITS UNLIMITED THERE'S NOT A TWENTY YEAR TIME LIMIT NOW RIGHT. FOR THERE IS A TWENTY BECAUSE WE CAN COULD HARM. I DO I DO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS YEAH WHICH I CAN GET BACK TO AND THERE IS NO POLICE ON THE YEAH I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ARE CONFORMED WITH THAT PREVIOUS FEDERAL ITEM ON THAT RIGHT. THE MINUTE I MEAN IN AND I AM THIS THE REASON BEHIND THAT OBVIOUS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WAS YOU KNOW WE WANTED WE DON'T KNOW SO I WANT TO INCENTIVIZE ENCOURAGE LOSSES WHO WANT TO ENCOURAGE. PRODUCTIVITY. RIGHT AND SO CERTAINLY WAS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEDUCT LOSSES BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LOSSES WHEN YOU TAKE A RISK YOU INVEST IN BUSINESS -- BUT PUT SOME KIND OF LIMIT ON THAT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OBVIOUSLY TO INCENTIVIZE. YOU KNOW -- MORE OBVIOUSLY PRODUCTIVITY FROM THAT FROM THAT BUSINESS IS THAT IS THAT KIND OF THE AND I MEAN. YEAH THAT'S GENERALLY CORRECT AND WE DO SEE INSTANCES WITHOUT GOING INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL SOME BUSINESSES SOME. PEOPLE ENGAGE IN A BUSINESS ARE VERY ADEPT AT GENERATING LOSSES -- YOU THROUGH USE OF STRATEGIC USE OF DEPRECIATION AND OTHER TECHNIQUES AND AND NOT ACTUALLY PAYING. ANY INCOME TAX -- SO WE THOUGHT AT LEAST THE SHOULD BE CAPPED AT HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR A FOR A MARRIED COUPLE. OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. YES THANK YOU JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- REGARDING UNDER THE I. T. C. -- TALK ABOUT A REFUNDABLE CHILD TAX CREDIT OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER QUALIFY TAX PAYER SO THAT MEAN A HUSBAND AND WIFE. EACH WITH IF THEY'RE BOTH EMPLOYED WOULD EACH GET A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT. SO IT WOULD BE PER HOUSEHOLD -- SO PREFER ONE FILING UNIT THEY WOULD WHOEVER'S QUITE WHICHEVER RETURN IS CLAIMING THE CHILD AS A DEPENDENT I WOULD GET THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD. AND WHAT WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUALIFIED TAXPAYERS. SO IN THIS INSTANCE IT WOULD BE ANYONE WHO PUTTING THIS PROVISION ASIDE QUALIFIES FOR SOME OTHER PART OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO SO IF YOU -- MAKE OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS -- AND YOU HAVE EARNED INCOME WHETHER THROUGH WAGES OR SELF EMPLOYED BUSINESS AND CALM -- AND YET TO THE POINT THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING BEFORE YOU HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER -- YOU WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE TAX CREDIT. YOU COULD YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY ON A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GET A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CUT THAT'S CORRECT YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KELLY ITC I REALLY AM GLAD ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THOSE WERE FILING WITH INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS THE AYE TENS ARE BEING EXCLUDED. THIS EXPANSION WAS INCLUDED IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND OF THE SENATE BUDGET SO WERE SENT IN. BUT WERE REMOVED AS PART OF THE LARGE TO GO CATIONS. THAT'S DISAPPOINTING -- IT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND. THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH AYE TENS ARE TAXPAYERS. AND THE PLACE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES THE THE YET THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL SERVICE. MEANT TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS I THINK FOR THIS ACT TO BE TRULY A WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF. IT HAS TO SUPPORT ALL FAMILIES AND NOT. FALL SHORT OF CHANGING -- THOSE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SIMPLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE PERSONS FILING HASN'T I TEN NUMBER. EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE OTHERS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BUT AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE AN AYE TEN FILER. THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS DENIED THE CREDIT. I AS LONG WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING. ON THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ONE DAY. VERY SOON FIND AT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME. FAMILIES IT DOES INCLUDE OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH TO OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CASEY NOW WE'RE MOVING ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YOUR MEMBERS COUNTY MUST FOR HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND AS WELL MY COLLEAGUE FROM WESTERN CENTER WHO HAD TO LEAVE FOR ANOTHER MEETING. WE WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE HERE REGARDS THAI TENS WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EXPANSION HERE AND FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE OUT. LOW INCOME FAMILIES -- THAT CONTRIBUTE OVER THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THAT'S A PROBLEM THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE EARNING ON AVERAGE ON A YEARLY BASIS A LITTLE OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY HAVE CITIZEN CHILDREN MANY TIMES IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND BY LEAVING THEM OUT OF THIS YOU'RE LEADING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PROXIMALLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF THIS INCREDIBLY. HELPFUL PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SO WE DO HOPE TO CONTINUE AS WAS NOTED HERE THE LEGISLATURE DID HAVE THIS IN BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE -- WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND HOPING THAT WE CAN GET THESE A LOW INCOME FOLKS INCLUDED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FOR HEARING BEHALF DISSOCIATION GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS WE ARE OPPOSED ONLY TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT. PERTAIN TO THE REPEAL OF LIKE KIND EXCHANGE. WE NEED TO SEE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT UPPER TAX AND THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF LEASED VEHICLES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD TODAY.

ONE IS NOT -- AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT LEAST AS BEING A A LOW COST OPTION FOR FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET INTO A NEW VEHICLE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT 95%. OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN THE STATE ARE LEAST. FOR THOSE -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE L. K. E. PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THANK YOU.
