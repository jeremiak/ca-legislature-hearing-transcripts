00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.198
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.566
SOMETIMES JUST PASSING ONE OTHER

IN THE HALLWAY --

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.002
WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE AS

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.470

AND TAKE THAT WORK.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.209
AS SERIOUSLY AS IT SHOULD BE

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.878
TAKEN GIVEN THE IMPACTS OF

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.079
ACTUALLY HAS ON THE GROWTH AND

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.214
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.016
AN IMPLICATION THAT HAS FILE

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.451
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.686
IS NOT.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:43.489
SOME INNOCUOUS CONDITION.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:44.824
WE'VE BEEN VERY PROUD OVER THE

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.859
PAST DECADE TO BE FOCUS ON THE

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.461
SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH.

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:49.829
NOW WE KNOW WHEN WE SUPPORT A

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:52.498
LOT OF WORK THAT'S FOCUSED ON

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.433
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.668
WE KNOW THAT HOW IMPORTANT THAT

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.637
IS WHEN ONE IS ILL OR SICK OR

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.871
YOU'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THOSE

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.706
THINGS FROM HAPPENING.

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.642
BUT WE ALSO KNOW 285% YOU HEALTH

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.310
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR BILL

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.578
ACCESS HEALTH CARE.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.712
IT'S ABOUT THE PLACES YOU LIVE

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:07.980
IN THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.148
ACTUALLY HAVE.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.983
AND WE AS A FOUNDATION OF FOCUS

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.351
MOST OF OUR ENERGIES.

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.520
IN THAT REGARD.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.788
AND SO I THOUGHT WITH THAT TODAY

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:16.889
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHO

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.391
WE ARE.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:19.558
YOU KNOW PART OF OUR WORK IS

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.094
ALSO ABOUT BRINGING COMMUNITIES

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.329
AND THEIR IDEAS AND OUR

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.498
ASPIRATIONS ABOUT A FUTURE THEY

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.099
PREFER TO BE AS MUCH AS WE

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.567
POSSIBLY CAN.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.736
AND SO TODAY IS OUR EQUITY ON

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.238
THE MALL WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.639
WE'VE DONE FOR THE PAST FOUR

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.541

WAITING HERE AND SHARING YOUR

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.401

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:03.903
WOULD LEGISLATORS ABOUT WHAT

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.304
THEY BELIEVE NEEDS TO HAPPEN

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.506
GOING FORWARD AS RELATES TO

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.474
CHILDREN A GREAT STATE OF

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.509
CALIFORNIA AS RELATES TO

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.478
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.080
AS WELL.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.715
I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THE

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.050
IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK ENOUGH.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.819
NO CALIFORNIA IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.454
STATE NOW I MOVED HERE AS A

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.588
YOUNG MAN.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:24.390
MADE AT MY HOME --

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.359
AND NO LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.893
THIS IS WHERE THEY WILL PUT ME

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.629
TO REST WHEN THAT TIME COMES AS

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:30.830
WELL.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.465
I LOVE THE STATE.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.400
ASSN CREDIBLE FIFTH LARGEST

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.167
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ALL KNOW

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:36.002
THAT.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.303
BUT ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.538
RATE IN AMERICA --

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.873
AND WE THINK THAT THIS IDEA TO

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.174
CALIFORNIANS.

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.676
IS SOMETHING WITH ALTHOUGH WHICH

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.811
WISDOM INNOVATION AND I THINK ON

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.413
A MORAL FORTITUDE THAT'S BEEN

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.814
DISPLAYED BY LEADERS IN THE

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:51.017
STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:51.951
DO AWAY WITH.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.686
IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THAT NEED

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:54.720
NOT HAPPEN.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:57.089
THEY NEED NOT BE REAL.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:57.690
THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:58.524
CONTROL.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.692
WHICH ALSO MEANS THE REALITY

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.460
THAT WE CAN CHANGE.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:03.662
AND SO WE ARE EXCITED NODDED TO

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.197
BE PARTING WITH ALL OF YOU. TO

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.633
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.934
ALL EXPECTATIONS IN OUR

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.569

VERY HAPPY WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.475
ON SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES AND

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.243
TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.045
HOUSING AND ITS IMPACT ON THE

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.846
WELL BEING OF CHILDREN.

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:21.947
WE THINK THAT THE FUND THAT WILL

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.349
BE ABLE DEEP UNDERSTANDING ABOUT

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.184
pWHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ALL.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.685
BUT ALSO TO MOVE THAT TO FIGURE

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.120
OUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE SOLUTIONS

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.122
COULD POSSIBLY BE.

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.690
AND THEN LASTLY TO KIND OF BUILD

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.392
THE KIND OF CONSTITUENCY THAT

WITH TOUGH ISSUES NEEDS IN ORDER

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.266
TO MOVE AN AGENDA.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.467
FOR THIS ABOUT MOVEMENT BUILDING

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.103
FOR US IS ABOUT EMPOWERING THOSE

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.371
WHO OFTEN ON EMPOWER.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.073
ALLOWING THEMTO HAVE THE SAME

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.975
HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS AND DREAMS

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.510
AND ACCESS TO THE MECHANISM THAT

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.045
MAKE THOSE THINGS REAL.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.513
THAT MOST OF US WITH GREAT A

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.715
PRIVILEGE HAVE THAT'S WHY WE ARE

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:59.185
HERE TODAY.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.453
I COULD RATTLE OFF A LOT OF

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.987
STATISTICS THAT ON MY SHEET IN

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:02.822
FRONT OF ME.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:03.923
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS HERE IN

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.324
CALIFORNIA.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.492
AND I COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT THE

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.226
CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE FOCUSED

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:10.362
OUR WROTE ONE IN FOUR SCHOOLS

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.331
YOU CAN'T DRINK THE WATER.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.299
NOT TELL YOU A QUICK STORY THAT

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.767
I ACCOMPLISHED WITH A COLLEAGUE

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.202
IN FLORIDA.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.837
WHEN WE TOLD HER THE STORY SHE

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.305
WANTS A FOUNDATION?

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.906
FOR WHEN WE TOLD A STORY SHE

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.408
ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WE WERE

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:23.876
BEING UNTRUE.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.579
ACTUALLY STILL RELY.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.848
A COMMENT TO ME WAS IN THE GREAT

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.850
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.518
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE HEART

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.854

WONDERFUL THINGS WE ABOUT

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.158
CALIFORNIA.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:40.559
THAT THERE COULD BE A REGIONAL

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.928
PLACE WHERE KIDS COULD NOT DRINK

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.830

SHE LIVES IN FLORIDA.

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.276

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.479
ABOUT WHAT WOULD LIKE LIFE WOULD

WEALTHY.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:04.884

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.522
GREAT STATE.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:10.856
THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE IN

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.591
THOSE TWO CONDITIONS.

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.026
IN ORDER TO GET THE THINGS THAT

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.995
WE CONSIDER TO BE BASICS IN

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.130
ONE'S LIFE.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.465
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.300
REALLY LOOK AT AS I SAID TO

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.234

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:33.445
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.948
CHANGE.

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:38.517
WE KNOW THAT IS NOT NOTION OF TO

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:39.151
CALIFORNIA'S IS SOMETHING THAT

DOCUMENTED IN ANY NUMBER OF

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.023
PLACES.

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.824
NO I'LL GREAT HOPE TODAY IS THAT.

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:48.460
WE MOVE BEYOND THE STUDIES AND

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:49.828
THE DOCUMENTATION WHICH WE KNOW

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.730

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:53.966

REALITY.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.022

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:26.665
THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS CAN BE

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.967
MORE CAN DO MORE TO CREATE

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.669
HEALTHY CHILDREN AND ADULTS.

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.170
HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.639
RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION TO

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:34.806
OUR HEALTH.

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:36.375
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OUR GENETIC

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.277
MAKEUP CONTRIBUTES 30% TO OUR

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.177
OVERALL HEALTH.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:42.247
INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR 40% SOCIAL

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:46.118
AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 20%.

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:47.953
AND HEALTH CARE 10%.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.222
HOWEVER EVEN THIS UNDERSTATES

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.291
THE TRUE IMPACTS OF THE SOCIAL

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:53.926
DETERMINANTS.

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:55.861
THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:59.431
HAS PROFOUND INFLUENCES NOT ONLY

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.033
ON OUR HEALTH BEHAVIORS.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.734
BUT ALSO ON HOW OUR GENES ARE

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:04.903
EXPRESSED AND WE KNOW THAT

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.805
STRESS RELATED TO THE

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.308
ENVIRONMENT IN THE EXPERIENCES

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:11.043
THAT WE HAVE IN IT HAS PROFOUND

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.245
EFFECTS ON BOTH THEIR BEHAVIOR

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.846
AND OUR GENES.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:17.683
ENSURING FULL ACCESS TO HIGH

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:19.885
QUALITY HEALTH CARE WILL HELP.

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.420
BUT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.488
ACCESS TO STABLE AFFORDABLE AND

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.958
SAFE HOUSING.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.359
HOW FULL AND AFFORDABLE FOOD

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:30.462
SAFE PLACES TO EXERCISE AND PLAY?

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.898
ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.700
AND HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS MAY BE

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.902
MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURING

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:37.135
HEALTH.

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:38.870
AND WELLNESS.

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.539
I WANT TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.773
THE ROLE THAT SAFE AND

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.175
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS IN

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:44.977
ENSURING HOUSE.

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.578
WE NARROW FROM DECADES OF

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.013
RESEARCH THAT HOUSING

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.048
INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:51.183
HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:52.951
HEALTH.

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:53.919
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.887
CHILDREN.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.322
AS DOCTOR MACK DOES MANDA

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.358
SOCIOLOGIST SAYS IN HIS

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.460
GROUNDBREAKING WORK EVICTED

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.228
WITHOUT STABLE SHELTER.

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:06.565
EVERYTHING ELSE FALLS APART.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.367
IN THE UNITED STATES OVER HALF A

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:09.601
MILLION PEOPLE HALF A MILLION

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.971
PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS EVERY NIGHT.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.906
ONE THIRD OF ALL PEOPLE

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.274
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:17.509
PART OF A FAMILY WITH YOUNG

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:21.680
CHILDREN. ONE IN FIVE HOMELESS

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.882
PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.884
A CHILD.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.419
FAMILIES EXPERIENCING

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.122
HOMELESSNESS OUR YOUNG FAMILIES.

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.290
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.492
CHILDREN.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.327
LIVING IN HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:39.765
UNDER THE AGE OF SIX ONE IN NINE

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.834
ARE INFANTS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD.

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:46.338
IN FACT THE MOST COMMON AGE IN

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.306
WHICH A PERSON IS LIKELY TO STAY

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.775
IN A HOMELESS SHELTER IN THE

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.010
UNITED STATES IS AN INFANT LESS

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:56.448
THAN. 112% OF THE NATION'S

HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH MINOR

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.786
CHILDREN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.821
CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:04.723
HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.158
FAMILIES IN THE U..

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:09.094
WITH AN ESTIMATED TWENTY ONE

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.529
THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH NIGHT BEING

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:13.165
MEMBERS OF HOMELESS FAMILIES

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:13.465
[inaudible]

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.801
FAMILIES EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:18.537
CAN BE INVISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC.

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:19.871
THEY ARE HIDDEN.

00:22:19.938 --> 00:22:22.874
HIDDEN AWAY IN HOMELESS SHELTERS.

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:25.077
DOUBLED UP IN CROWDED AND

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:27.179
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS WITH FRIENDS

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:28.680
OUR FAMILIES.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.649
LIVING IN THEIR CARS IN

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.150
ABANDONED BUILDINGS ARE IN HOTEL

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:34.553
ROOMS.

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.822
BUT THEIR LACK OF VISIBILITY

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:39.691
DOES NOT PROTECT THEM IN ANY WAY

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.193
FROM THE TERRIFYING RISKS OF

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.428
HOMELESSNESS.

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:44.863
WHEN WE THINK OF HOMELESSNESS IN

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.498
CHILDREN WE THINK OF BOTH

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.467
CHILDREN LIVING IN FAMILIES WHO

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.702
ARE MOSTLY GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT?

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:51.737
BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.371
UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH YOUTH AND

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:56.108
YOUNG ADULTS AGED TWELVE TO

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:56.875
TWENTY FIVE WHO EXPERIENCE

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.210
HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT A PARENT OR

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.078
GUARDIAN.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.080
APPROXIMATELY 11% OF PEOPLE

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:04.349
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.017
NIGHT OUR UNACCOMPANIED YOU.

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:08.120
WHILE MOST ARE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:11.723
AND 2512% ARE UNDER.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.492
EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.260
HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:17.262
YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:20.132
IN A SINGLE NIGHT IN JANUARY TWO

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:21.666
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:23.401
OVER TWELVE THOUSAND

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:25.103
UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.572
HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.608
CALIFORNIA FOR ACCOUNTED FOR

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:32.811
OVER HALF OF ALL ON SHELTERED

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:34.012
HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE UNITED

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:35.981
STATES.

00:23:36.047 --> 00:23:37.983
UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH FACE

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:39.718
UNPARALLELED RISK THEY ARE

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.186
HIGHER RISK OF SEXUAL

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.022
TRAFFICKING OF SURVIVAL SACKS OF

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.159
SUBSTANCE USE AND VICTIMIZATION.

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:49.327
THEY FACE EXTRAORDINARY RISKS OF

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:52.564
DYING FROM VIOLENCE OVERDOSE AND

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.466
SUICIDE.

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.334
UNACCOMPANIED HOMELESS YOUTH ARE

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:58.370
SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:01.006
CITIZENS.

00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:02.340
TURNING BACK TO FAMILY

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:03.642
HOMELESSNESS.

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:16.888
THE PRIMARY.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:18.857
SING NEEDS MEANS THAT A

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.659
HOUSEHOLD IS LOW INCOME SO THEY

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.260
MAKE NO MORE THAN HALF OF THE

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.628
AREA MEDIAN INCOME.

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:25.130
DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY HOUSING

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:26.464
BENEFITS LIKE HOUSING CHOICE

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.767
VOUCHERS AND SPENDS MORE THAN

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:30.302
HALF OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:31.703
ON RENT.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.271
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE THE

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:36.107
LARGEST GROUP OF AMERICANS WITH

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:39.811
HIGH WORST CASE HOUSING NEEDS.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.413
35% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS WITH WORST

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:42.881
CASE HOUSING NEEDS ARE FAMILIES

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.683
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.852
THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN RISING AND

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:48.720
CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:50.288
HIGHEST RATES OF WORST CASE

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:53.592
HOUSING NEEDS IN THE COUNTRY.

00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:55.293
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.528
ACTUALLY AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:58.096
ADDICTION.

00:24:58.163 --> 00:24:59.264
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY THAN

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.799
HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT CHILDREN TO

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.934
REPORT DIFFICULTY PAYING RENT

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.669
AND THEY'RE TWICE AS LIKELY TO

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.571
FACE EVICTION.

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:07.839
THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:09.074
HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN HAVE

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.909
DIFFICULTY BALANCING WORK WITH

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:12.777
CHILD REARING AND THEY'RE MORE

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:15.213
LIKELY TO FACE LEAST VIOLATIONS

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.314
DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:19.150
OVERCROWDING NOISE DAMAGE OR

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:20.752
SIMPLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.454
CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR CHILDREN

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.122
BEING CHILDREN.

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:25.223
EXACTLY.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.892
THEY FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.560
WHEN LOOKING FOR NEW HOUSING AND

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.195
FREQUENTLY HAVE TO MOVE IN WITH

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:32.497
OTHER FAMILIES OR MOVE TO LOWER

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:34.332
QUALITY HOUSING OR MOVE TO

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.734
DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.202
EVEN IF THEY DON'T BECOME

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.638
HOMELESS THIS CAN CREATE MANY

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.673
HARDSHIPS INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.642
IN WORK FOR ADULTS IN SCHOOL FOR

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.877
CHILDREN.

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:47.312
FAMILY VIOLENCE IS A VERY

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.947
FREQUENT PERCENT FOR TENT OF

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.515
HOUSING LOST.

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:53.785
MORE THAN 80% OF CHILDREN WOMEN

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.287
WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.388
HAVE EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL

00:25:56.454 --> 00:25:58.156
VIOLENCE.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.158
AND WE KNOW THAT PARENTS WHO

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.093
HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE ADVERSE

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.428
CHILDHOOD ADVANCE WHEN THEY WERE

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.297
CHILDREN ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:08.733
BECOMING HOMELESS AS ADULTS.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.768
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.803
THAT OVER THREE QUARTERS OF

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.205
PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:16.574
IN FAMILIES IDENTIFY EITHER AS

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:19.477
NON WHITE OR IS WHITE LIGHT NEXT.

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:21.379
OVER HALF OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:22.781
IT IN FAMILIES EXPERIENCE

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:24.950
HOMELESSNESS IDENTIFY AS BLACK

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.184
AMERICANS.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.353
THIS IS ALMOST FOUR FOLD HIGHER

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.221
THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:31.356
TWICE AS HIGH AS A

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.590
REPRESENTATION OF BLACK

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:34.926
AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.796
IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISK

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:38.964
MEREKA.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.732
WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE INSIDIOUS

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.300
ROLE THAT RACISM PLAYS IN

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:45.103
CONTRIBUTING TO IT.

00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:57.916
THESE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE

00:26:57.983 --> 00:26:59.718
TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF HOMELESSNESS

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:01.353
ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:02.921
HOMELESSNESS IN CHILDREN HAS

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:05.123
BEEN LINKED TO A MYRIAD.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.191

FAMILIES EXPERIENCING

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.619
HOMELESSNESS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

FOR CHILDREN BEING PLACED OUT OF

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:44.462

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.498
THESE SEPARATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO

CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO HAVE

IT AFFECTS EDUCATIONAL

CHILDREN IN HOMELESS FAMILIES

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:18.196
ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE REGULAR

USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:30.909
TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.911
HOMELESSNESS IS DEVASTATING TO

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.612
HEALTH FOR BOTH ADULTS AND

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:37.449

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.719
AS HOUSING.

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:43.488
SO WHAT ARE THE BEST STRATEGIES

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:44.889
TO RESPOND TO FAMILY

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.724

DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS.

INTERVENTIONS TO ASSIST FAMILIES

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.638
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.574
THEY LOOKED AT LONG TERM HOUSING

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.642
SUBSIDIES SUCH AS HOUSING CHOICE

00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:06.077

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.040
SERVICES.

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:38.943
IT IS RARE THAT WE HAVE SUCH

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.279
RIGOROUS RE RESEARCH ON TOPICS

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.647
REGARDING THE SOCIAL

THE FAMILY OPTIONS STUDY

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:48.052

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:52.590
AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS.

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:54.125
OF HOMELESSNESS.

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:55.760
THE FAMILY OPTION STUDY RANDOMLY

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:58.329
ASSIGNED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:04.169
IN TWELVE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:06.938
ONE IN CALIFORNIA TWO ONE OF

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.239
THESE FOUR INTERVENTIONS.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.108
FAMILIES WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:12.377
HAD STAYED FOR AT LEAST A WEEK

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:13.912
AN EMERGENCY SHELTER.

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:16.014
THE STUDY TRACKED THE FAMILIES

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.448
FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:18.950

AND FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY.

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:29.260
THE USUAL CARE GROUP TEACHES US

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.395
WHAT HAPPENS TO FAMILIES WHO

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.197
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.098
REAL WORLD WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL

INTERVENTION.

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:38.469
ON AVERAGE THESE FAMILIES SPENT

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.038
FOUR OF THE NEXT THIRTY SEVEN

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:41.606

LIVING AND EMERGENCY SHELTER.

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:45.610
MOST DID RECEIVE SOME FORMS OF

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.819
AND OVER ONE THIRD EVENTUALLY

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.054
GOT SOME FORM OF HOUSING

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.655
VOUCHERS.

00:30:57.722 --> 00:31:01.893
DESPITE THIS AT THREE YEARS 39%

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.761
REPORTED HAVING BEEN DOUBLED UP

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.597
ARE HOMELESS IN THE PRIOR SIX

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:08.399

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.772
THE FAMILIES WHO RECEIVED

HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:19.844
IMMEDIATELY AFTER RANDOMIZATION

00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:22.814
DID THE BEST BY FAR.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.649
THERE ARE HOUSING AND HEALTH

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.884
OUTCOMES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.754
BETTER THAN THE OTHER GROUPS.

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.990
PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO THIS GROUP

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:34.559
THE VOUCHER GROUP WHERE ONE HALF

HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCES IN THE

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.298
NEXT THREE YEARS.

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.767
SOME OTHER NOTABLE FINDINGS

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:44.469
THOSE WHO RECEIVE VOUCHERS

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:46.871
COMPARED TO THOSE IN USUAL CARE

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:49.140
WHERE HALF IS LIKELY. TO

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:52.010
EXPERIENCE FAMILY VIOLENCE IN

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.578
THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.747
AND THE ADULTS WERE LESS LIKELY

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.215
TO HAVE SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.851
OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:00.151
[inaudible]

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:02.520
CHILDREN EXPERIENCE FEWER SCHOOL

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:05.156
MOVES LESS ABSENCES.

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:07.825
AND FEWER BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:10.028
IMPORTANTLY IN THE LONG TERM

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:12.030
FAMILIES ASSIGNED TO RAPID RE

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.899
HOUSING DID NOT FARE MUCH BETTER

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.434
THAN FAMILIES ASSIGNED TO USUAL

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:17.935
CARE.

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:20.071
THOSE IN RAPID RE HOUSING HAD A

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.973
SIMILAR LIKELIHOOD OF

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.741
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT THE

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:25.743
FILE WHAT POINTS AS THOSE WITH

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.378
USUAL CARE.

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.580
THOSE IN PROJECT BASED HOUSING

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.082
HAD BETTER OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:34.052
TERM BUT NOT IN THE LONG TERM.

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.486
THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE BETTER

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.088
WELL BEING THAN THOSE IN USUAL

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:38.890
CARE.

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:41.025
INTERESTINGLY THE TOTAL PROGRAM

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.661
COSTS OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:46.297
VOUCHERS WAS ONLY FOUR THOUSAND

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.499
DOLLARS MORE OVER THE NEXT THREE

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:51.035
YEARS THEN THOSE ASSIGNED TO

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.503
USUAL CARE.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.772
THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE DOES IN

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.808
USUAL CARE RECEIVED SOME OF THE

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:59.310
SERVICES FOR INSTANCE SUMMIT

00:32:59.377 --> 00:32:59.811
COULD EVENTUALLY RECEIVE

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:00.912
VOUCHERS.

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:03.548
BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE SHELTER

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.016
AND TEMPORARY PROGRAMS ARE

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:07.352
EXPENSIVE.

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:08.786
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE.

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.088
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.589
THE STUDY AND I CERTAINLY

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:12.824
ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.625
IT.

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:16.127
IT GIVES A SENSE OF BOTH THE

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:18.062
ENORMOUS TOLL OF HOMELESSNESS ON

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.697
FAMILIES AND PRESENTS A WAY

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.299
FORWARD.

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:23.468
IMPLEMENTING HOUSING VOUCHERS IS

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:25.703
NOT AN EASY SOLUTION.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.739
CURRENTLY ONLY ONE IN FOUR

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:30.141

OUR COSTLIEST REGIONS IN

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.386
CALIFORNIA.

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.421
EVEN WITH A VOUCHER IT CAN BE

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.391
VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THAT.

00:33:46.457 --> 00:33:48.393
RAPID RE HOUSING IS LIKELY A

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.194
READ REASONABLE OPTION TO

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:54.332
AWAIT A MORE PERMANENT OPTION

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.833
BUT THE DATA IS PRETTY CLEAR

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.368
THAT IF WE COULD DO THE BEST

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:58.803
THING IT WOULD BE TO GET THOSE

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.873
FAMILIES VOUCHERS RIGHT AWAY.

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:04.742

TO FAMILY HOMELESSNESS.

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.979

LIFELONG TOLL A FAMILY

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.750

AS A PHYSICIAN WHO CARES FOR LOW

LIFELONG EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:29.734

A SENSE OF HOW DRAMATIC THE

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.340
REDUCTION IN FEDERAL FUNDING IS

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.409
BàN YET FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.184
ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY FEDERAL

THROUGH I'M SECTION EIGHT

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.026
VOUCHERS WAS DRAMATICALLY CUT.

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:31.529
SOME ESTIMATE THAT WERE NOW IN

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:32.964
SORT OF REAL DOLLARS AND IT'S

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:36.133
ABOUT A QUARTER OR 30% OF WHAT

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.537
WE WERE IN REAL DOLLARS IN

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:40.104
NINETEEN EIGHTY AND THEN WE

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.706
WONDER WHY WE HAVE A

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:43.508
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.576
AND I THINK AS A PHYSICIAN A LOT

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.878
OF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO ME

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.646
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IS CAUSING

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.314
HOMELESSNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:52.183
AND I'M HERE TO SAY HOMELESSNESS

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.186
RESULTS FROM A LACK OF

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.621
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:57.622
AND IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH ALL

00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:59.257
REDUCTION OF THE STATE IN TERMS

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.892
OF OUR CAL WORKOUT RANTS WE IT'S

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.493
ALSO THE REDUCTION IN INCOME FOR

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.961
PEOPLE TO EVEN BE ABLE TO PAY

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:05.696
FOR HOUSING EXACTLY AND WHEN

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:07.098
THERE WAS THERE AND THE

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:10.067
REDUCTION IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:10.468
EIGHT AT I HAVE.

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:15.106
ANDTHAT SORT OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:16.874
THAT FROM THERE YEAH --

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.609
ONE OTHER.

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:21.712
AND OF COURSE THEN IF WE ADD. TO

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:24.148
THAT WERE WAY BEHIND IN TERMS OF

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.083
NUMBER OF UNITS PER CAPITA YEAH

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.586
THEN SCARCITY DRIVES UP PRICES

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.655
SAQLAIN PRICES YOU COUPLE THAT

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.390
WITH THE LACK OF ASSISTANCE THAT

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:33.357
MIGHT BE NEEDED.

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.493
THE WAY INCREASING PRICES AND

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.460
THEN WE SEE THIS RISE IN

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:39.564
HOMELESSNESS COULD YOU COMMENT

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.198
JUST BRIEFLY --

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.234
I HAVE BEEN INTERACTING WITH A

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:47.405
LOT OF BOTH THE PEOPLE WHO

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.806
FAMILIES WHO ARE HOMELESS IN MY

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.274
DISTRICT IN THERE AND SERVICE

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.576
PROVIDERS.

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:54.245
AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT.

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:56.380
THEY OFTEN HAVE VERY EXTREME

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:59.183
DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF SHELTERS

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.885
YEAH THAT AND I I'M BRINGING

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:01.485
THIS UP AND I WANT YOU TO COME

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:03.788
IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE SORT

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.323
OF BEEN PUSHING TOWARDS.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.758
EXPANDING SHELTERS BUT WHAT THE

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.061
MAYOR YES BUT WHAT IT HERE.

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:11.462
ANYWAY --

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.563
BUT WHAT.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.832
THE FEEDBACK I'M GETTING IS FOR

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.200
EXAMPLE MANY SHELTERS.

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:17.468
ARE -- SEX

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:21.405
SEGREGATED THE HOMELESS MOTHER.

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:23.741
HER SON IS TWELVE OR OLDER ALL

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.343
THE SAID IN HER SON CAN'T BE IN

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.811
SHELTERS SHE WANTS TO KEEP HER

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.412
FAMILY TOGETHER RIGHT SO SHE

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.449
STAYS IN THE CAR YEAH FOR SHE

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:32.583
ANY NUMBER OF APPS LIKE THAT IF

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.284
YOU COULD JUST.

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.852
WRAP INCIDENTLY I MEAN I THINK A

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.320
LOT OF HOMELESS FAMILIES

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.622
ACTUALLY DON'T SHOW UP IN THEIR

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.724
SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM WORKS

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:40.925
SO POORLY FOR RIGHT NOW.

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:42.960
AND SO THEY ARE HIT IN EITHER IN

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.363
CARS OR THEIR SORT OF QUADRUPLED

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.365
UP IN AN UNSAFE HOUSING

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.000
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.668
IS REALLY NOT ORIENTED TOWARDS

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.937
THEM. ONE OF THE REASONS I SPENT

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:54.405
SOME TIME ON THE FAMILY OPTION

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.340
STUDY IS IT ACTUALLY POINTS OUT

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:57.341
THAT.

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:58.776
SHELTERS ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.778
AND I KNOW HOUSING IS REALLY

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.813
HARD TO BUILD BUT I THINK WE

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.116
NEED TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THAT AS

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:06.584
OUR GOAL FOR THE SOLUTION.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.452
AS WELL AS LOOK AT EXIT THE

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.021
EXISTING HOUSING STOCK IN THAT

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:11.355

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:12.823
EIGHT LOOKING THAT VOUCHER

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:18.763
HEARTBREAKING WHEN YOU SOME OF

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.231
THE STATISTICS --

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.867
THESE OUT FAMILIES THAT CAN

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.468
AFFORD HOUSING AND LIVED IN A

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.436
SINGLE.

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:25.970
YOU KNOW --

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.471

GROWING UP YOU KNOW THE SIZE

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:30.875
VERY PERSONAL TO ME BUT SECONDLY

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.410
I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.311
WITH DIGNITY AS WELL ON I WAS A

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.180

I REMEMBER --

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.653
IT TOOK ME THREE WEEKS TO REAL

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.689
TO DO WITH THAT DIGNITY OF LIFE

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.357
I MEAN THEY FEEL SO --

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:47.892
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:48.893
SOMETIMES TO REACH OUT WHEN

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:50.594
THEY'VE HAD A STABLE ENVIRONMENT

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.229
AND ALL THIS SUNDAY HAVE TO

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.197
REACH OUT AND SAY I NEED HOUSING

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.666
AND AND SO YES WE DID HAVE A LOT

00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:56.901
OF THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:58.235
LIVING IN CARS AND AND IT'S

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.670
REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU.

SOMETIMES FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.578
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE IT

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.045
WAS UP.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:10.481

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:27.525
TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.192
THAT MANY OF US THINK THAT THIS

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.728
ONLY HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.029
WERE REALLY HARD AND THEY'RE

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.632
LIKE AND YOU KNOW THAT IS JUST

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:37.301
WRONG AND I I SAY IT AS SOMEONE

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:38.302
WHO.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.838
HAD A BRIEF AND TEMPORARY BOUT

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:42.640
OF HOMELESSNESS AND MY DAUGHTER

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:46.110
AND I DID LIVE IN MY CAMPER VAN.

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:50.514
AND WE WERE I WAS IN A BETWEEN

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.982
JOBS IN A PERIOD WHERE I WAS

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:53.918
BETWEEN JOBS.

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:56.520
AND THE SHAME OF AND YOU KNOW

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:57.354
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FIRST AND

00:40:57.421 --> 00:41:00.291
LAST SO YOU CAN'T GET INTO YOUR

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.358
NEXT RENTAL UNIT.

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:01.992
END.

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:05.329
I WAS FORTUNATE I HAD A FRIEND

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.498
BASE OF SAFETY NET THAT THEY

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.799
COULD GIVE ME.

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:10.434
MY DAUGHTER AND I LIVED WITH

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:11.602
THEM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.204
TILL I COULD GET THAT FIRST AND

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.706
LAST AND THEN WE SECURED HOUSING

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.141
WE'VE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM SINCE.

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.944
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE FOR

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.612
ANY NUMBER OF REASONS.

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:24.849
AND THEN OF COURSE IT SPIRALS.

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.984
IN ANYWAY AT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:28.652
AND I THINK IN ARE REALLY

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.487
DISTORTED HOUSING ENVIRONMENT

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:33.824
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW HAS ONLY

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.192
TWENTY TWO UNITS OF AFFORDABLE

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.728
HOUSING FOR FAMILIES FOR EVERY

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:38.629
HUNDRED FAMILIES.

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:39.864
MAKING --

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.067
LAST SPEND THIRTY PER COME AND

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.169
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE 30%

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:47.037
OF AREA MEDIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:49.607
IS ACTUALLY QUITE A HIGH SALARY.

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.342
AND IT'S LIKE THAT CHILDHOOD

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:53.344
GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS THERE

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.346
SIMPLY ENOUGH HOUSING AND IT

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.781
REALLY CAN AND DOES HAPPEN TO

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.884
ANYBODY THE SHAME ISRAEL THE

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.886
FEAR IS REAL BECAUSE PEOPLE'S

00:42:01.952 --> 00:42:03.420
CHILDREN ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:04.221
THEM.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:05.422
IF THEY ARE HOMELESS AND SO

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:06.724
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.692
FAMILIES DON'T WANNA PRESENT

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.527
BECAUSE THEY FEAR THAT THEIR

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.062
CHILDREN WILL BE REMOVED.

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:14.865
THE TRAUMA IS REAL AND IT REALLY

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.500
SPIRALS ON ITSELF BECAUSE WHEN

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.968
YOU DON'T HAVE HOUSING YOU KNOW

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.904
PEOPLE WIND UP LOSING THEIR JOB

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.472
OR THEIR KIDS YOU KNOW MIGHT NOT

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.907
WANT TO GO TO THE MOTEL BECAUSE

00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:24.341
IT MIGHT MEAN A DIFFERENT SCHOOL

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:25.676
OR OR TWO YOU KNOW TRANSFERRING

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:25.943
SO.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.578
IT'S A REALLY TERRIBLE PROBLEM

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.413
THAT WE NEED.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.347

AND SHE REALLY SHE MOVED

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.301
FREQUENTLY AS A CHILD --

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:34.271
DUE TO MY GRANDMOTHERS ECONOMIC

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:37.307

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:39.610
THE THEY MOVE VERY OFTEN WHEN

SHE WAS VERY YOUNG IN.

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.113
WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN SEVENTH GRADE

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.962
WEEKS SO SHE CAN GET THE AWARD

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.597
WHICH WAS IMPORTANT TO OUR AND

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:01.965
FOR WHATEVER REASON MY

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:03.534
GRANDMOTHER REFUSED AND MOVE

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.402
THEM OUT TO CALIFORNIA --

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.537
TWO WEEKS BEFORE SEVENTH GRADE

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:07.905
WAS OVER.

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.173
MY MOM WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:11.141
IMPACTFUL THAT WAS FOR HER AND

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.743
HOW PAINFUL IT WAS TO MOVE.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.344
AND HOW EACH TIME SHE MOVED

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:15.813
THERE WERE PRIZED POSSESSIONS

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.915
LEFT BEHIND AND FRIENDS LEFT

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:18.849
BEHIND.

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:22.419
AND SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT RIGHT

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:23.020
THAT SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND AS

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:25.389
WELL.

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:26.623
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.225
IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:29.526
THAT YOU KNOW HOUSING STABILITY

00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:30.627
IS JUST DOESN'T BOIL DOWN TO

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.696
COST ALONE THERE ARE MANY OTHER

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.131
FACTORS FOR FAMILIES.

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:36.667
THAT PLAY AND THAT OUR PERSONAL

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.268
AND ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY.

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.403
BUT THE POINT I THINK WE'VE HAD

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.439
IN CALIFORNIA IS IS THAT THE THE

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.874
HOUSING COSTS ARE EATING UP

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.242
PEOPLE'S INCOME.

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:46.910
THAT THEY MAKE SMALL DECISIONS

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:48.645
OR SMALL STROKES OF BAD LUCK IN

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.147
THE CRISES IN A WAY THAT

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:51.715
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED TWENTY

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.617
YEARS AGO IN CALIFORNIA.

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.819
AND PUSH FAMILIES INTO INTO

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:59.289
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES --

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:00.257
YOU KNOW I COULD SPEND THE

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:01.658
ENTIRE TIME KIND OF GOING

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:03.127
THROUGH STATISTICS --

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:05.129
ON KIND OF HOW BAD IT IS IN

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:06.930
CALIFORNIA BUT MY GUESS IS THAT

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.899
MOST OF YOU KNOW SORT OF HOW BAD

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:09.566
IT IS.

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:11.068
IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES YOU'VE

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.503
HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:13.937
A COUPLE OF JUST.

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.205
SMALL THINGS.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.007
THERE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.575
HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:19.643
PAY MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.612
INCOME IN RENT.

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.213
YEAH THOSE ARE HOUSEHOLD STAFF

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.315
MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND A LOT

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:26.884
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.418
YOU KNOW MAKING THOSE TOUGH

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:28.986
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:31.889
GOING TO PAY --

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:34.725
FOR TEN POINT 9% OF ALL CSU

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.460
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.628
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:40.731
LAST TWELVE MONTHS. TWENTY ONE

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:43.333
OF THE THIRTY MOST EXPENSIVE

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.568
RENTAL HOUSING MARKETS IN THE

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.538
ENTIRE COUNTRY ARE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:48.739
THIS IS JUST A FEW I THINK OF

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.007
THE DATA POINTS TO KIND OF

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.775
DESCRIBE THE SITUATION WE FIND

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.511
OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.445
IN ITS INTERSECTION I THINK WITH

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:55.746
[inaudible]

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.447
WITH HELP.

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:59.183
HEALTHCARE IS A THREE POINT

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:01.852
THREE TRILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS.

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.654
IN THE UNITED STATES 90% OF

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.089
THOSE COSTS ARE RELATED TO

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:06.657
CHRONIC DISEASE AND MENTAL

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.858
HEALTH.

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.893
AND THOSE THINGS ARE CLOSELY

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.494
TIED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:12.329
HEALTH.

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.198
AND THAT CHRONIC DISEASE IS

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.199
DRIVEN.

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.833
IN A GREAT DEAL BY POVERTY

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.303
THAT'S FACED BY FAMILIES.

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:20.137
AND DRIVES UP OUR HEALTHCARE

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.506
COSTS -- BUT

00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:23.874
ALSO THAT THE REASON THAT WE PAY

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.842
SO MUCH FOR HOUSING IS BECAUSE

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.811
WE REFUSE TO SEE HOUSING AND THE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:28.912
OTHER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.414
HEALTH AS PART OF THE HEALTH

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.915
DELIVERY SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:34.284
AND WITHIN OUR STATE.

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.719
BUT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.588
HEALTH COSTS THERE ALSO THE VERY

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.590
SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON OUR ECONOMY

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.225
A COSTS IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.160
AND JUST ON THE DESIRE OF PEOPLE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:43.694
TO REMAIN IN OUR STATE ALL

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.696
TOGETHER.

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:46.863
SO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.298
WHAT I SEE IS THE ORIGINS OF

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.466
PROBLEMS A HOUSING CRISIS IN

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.667
CALIFORNIA.

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.836
IN IT SO OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.304
HOUSING MARKET BUT THAT THAT.

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:54.905
THE HOUSING MARKET IN

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:56.807
CALIFORNIA'S HIGHLY REGULATED

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.408
THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES IN SO

00:47:58.475 --> 00:47:59.276
MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:01.245
PROCESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:04.881
AND AND HOW HOUSING IS REGULATED.

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.149
SO IT THE PROBLEM I WANT TO

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.384
BREAK IT DOWN INTO TWO BUCKETS

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.986
THAT WE HAVE BOTH THE LACK OF

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.287
HOUSING SUPPORTS THE LACK OF

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.388
FUNDING.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:12.723
AND IT TOO WE HAVE PUBLIC

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.124
POLICIES AS A WHOLE THAT HAVE

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.125
MADE HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE IN

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:17.427
CALIFORNIA.

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:18.762
IN A VERY BROAD LEVEL WE

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.564
DESIGNED A HOUSING SYSTEM THAT

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.833
MAXIMIZES BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.134
WHO ALREADY OWN PROPERTY.

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.569
PEOPLE WITH WEALTH.

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:26.803
REALTORS AND REAL ESTATE

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.772
SPECULATORS.

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.073
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.842
RADICAL STATEMENT IN SOME WAYS

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.610
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY JUST THE FACTS.

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:34.745
YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THE

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.113
VALUES ARE THOSE DECISIONS ARE

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.848
NOT BUT IN MANY WAYS AS A JUST

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.483
FACTS ABOUT HOW WE DESIGN A

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:41.318
HOUSING SYSTEM CALIFORNIA.

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:42.719
I DON'T THINK THOSE THAT WE

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:43.887
DECIDED THAT WE WANTED THAT

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.989
OUTCOME BUT A SERIES OF SMALL

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.457
DECISIONS PRODUCED THAT.

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:48.992
WE'VE SEEN HUGE CUTS.

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.394
IN FEDERAL AND STATE HOUSING

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.228
PROGRAMS.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.996
WE SEE ON YEARS OF ZONING AND

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.298
OTHER LAND USE CAN STARK

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:55.399
CONTROLS.

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.400
THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.602
REINFORCE SEGREGATE DOES A

00:48:58.669 --> 00:48:59.670
CERTAIN WAY OF LIVING IN OUR

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:02.105
STATE --

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.206
THAT WE'VE DECIDED TO LET THE

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.474
DESIRES OF THE IMMEDIATE

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.410
NEIGHBORS OVERRULED THE NEEDS OF

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:08.545
THE REGION AND OF THE STATE.

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.579
THAT WE'VE IMPOSED A VERY

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.581
EXPENSIVE IDEA THAT THE ONLY

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.116
ACCEPTABLE WAY TO LIVE IS IN A

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:14.251
SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:15.319
SUBDIVISION.

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.586
THAT WE'VE ZONED OUT MULTI

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:18.588
FAMILY HOUSING WITH NO NOT

00:49:18.655 --> 00:49:20.190
RESIDENTIAL HOTELS ROOMING

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:21.558
HOUSES.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.993
ANY OTHER WAYS THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.995
HISTORICALLY KEPT THEMSELVES OUT

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:25.962
OF HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY'RE ON

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:28.332
THE EDGE.

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.200
IT WILL DEVELOP THE TAX POLICY

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.635
LIKE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.303
SKEW THE TAX MARKET THE PROVIDES

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.439
HUGE BENEFITS TO PEOPLE THAT

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.206
STAY IN THEIR HOMES FOR A LONG

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:37.140
TIME.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:39.176
THE REDUCE IT PROPERTY TAX RATE

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:42.212
AND FORCES TO PUT IMPACT FEES ON

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:42.813
HOUSING THAT ARE TWO TO THREE

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:43.280
TIMES.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.648
WHAT IT TAKES TO COVER THE COST

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.083
OF SERVICES MORTGAGE INTEREST

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.185
DEDUCTION THAT BENEFITS YOU THE

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.620
HIGHER YOUR TAX BRACKET IS --

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:51.822
AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP RULES

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.256
ALLOW LOTS OF PEOPLE TO HOLD

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.125
HOUSING AND LLC'S AND HIDE THE

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.593
OWNERSHIP.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.994
AND ALLOWED LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.730
OTHER COUNTRIES TO LAUNDER THEIR

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.565
MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.467
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT SOLVING THE

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:05.035
HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA I

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.436
THINK THEREFORE BUCKETS THAT I

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.105
THINK ABOUT. ONE WE NEED TO

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.406
INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:11.508
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:13.176
SUPPORTS OVERALL.

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:14.311
WE NEED TO ALTER THE TAX SYSTEM

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:16.246
IN A WAY THAT.

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:18.448
MAKES AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD.

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:19.983
FOR RENTERS AND FOR PEOPLE

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.452
TRYING TO BUY HOMES.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:22.986
THAT WE NEED TO CREATE AN

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.888
CENTRAL CREATE INCENTIVES FOR

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.056
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GREEN LIGHT

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:28.225
MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND TO

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.793
PUNISH EXCLUSIONARY ZONING.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.094
MUCH OF SILICON VALLEY FOR

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.462
INSTANCE IS STILL DEVELOP LIKE

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.297
IT'S A SUBURB OF OMAHA AND NOT

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.532
LIKE IT'S A ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.466
JOB CENTERS.

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.568
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.736
I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.271
LOOKING HOUSING ELEMENT REFORM

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:42.372
IS GREAT.

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:43.974
BUT I THINK THAT ANY SOLUTION WE

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.375
LOOK AT MUST REALLY TACKLE

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.877
EXCLUSIONARY ZONING.

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:48.078
AND IT CAN'T JUST BE FOCUSED ON

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.713
OBSERVING BLACK AND BROWN

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.714
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:53.250
AROUND THE STATE.

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.451
AND LASTLY THAT WE NEED TO

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.553
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.788
AT THE VERY LEAST YOU SHOULDN'T

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.689
BE AFFECTED IF YOU'RE PLAYING BY

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.858
THE RULES AND PAYING YOUR RENT.

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.527
AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T LET THE

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.928
GROWTH OF CORPORATE LANDLORDS

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.196
LIKE BLACKSTONE.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:09.166
FIND WAYS TO MONETIZE EVICTING.

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.934
OUR RENTERS IN OUR STATE THAT WE

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.202
NEED TO ENFORCE THE FAIR HOUSING

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:13.403
LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN STRENGTH IN

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.772
THOSE.

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.207
IN SORT OF MY ADD ON TO THAT IS

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.508
THAT THERE ARE THREE BIG SYSTEMS

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.643
THAT INFLUENCE HOMELESSNESS IN

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:21.344
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CONTROLLED

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:21.845
BY THE STATE.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.780
HEALTH CARE CHILD WELFARE AND

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.615
CORRECTIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:27.050
WORK TO BE DONE IN EACH OF THOSE

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.685
SYSTEMS. TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:29.820
PEOPLE THAT ARE ENTERING INTO

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.421
HOMELESSNESS.

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:32.289
THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF WAYS

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.558
Y. IN WHICH YOU ALL AS A STATE

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:36.426
GOVERNMENT CAN SHIFT THE NATURE

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:36.960
OF THE HOUSING SYSTEM IN

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:37.894
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:39.196
BUT I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:41.131
IS ONE OF VALUES AND PRIORITIES

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.833
WHAT THE OUTCOMES DO YOU WANT TO

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:43.467
SEE.

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:44.334
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT HOUSING

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:47.103
REMAINS AN IN OR IS IT MORE

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.171
IMPORTANT THAT OUR HOUSING

00:51:48.238 --> 00:51:49.739
POLICY WORKS TO PROVIDE STABLE

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:51.475
HOUSING FOR THE MOST NUMBER OF

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:51.741
FAMILIES.

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:52.542
POSSIBLE [inaudible]

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.862
REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND --

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.464
AND STABLE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:57.632
ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.835
ENSURING THIS VISION IS REALIZED.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.336
HOWEVER OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.604
MAKING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.005
IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:05.740
FAMILIES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ABLE

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.442
TO SECURE A SYSTEMS THE PROMISES

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:08.743
TO HELP THEM AFFORD AN APARTMENT

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.345
ON THE PRIVATE MARKET.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.980
MANY FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO FIND

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.115
HOUSING EVEN WITH HOUSING

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:14.749
ASSISTANCE DID A BLANKET

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:15.851
POLICIES OF LANDLORDS.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.252
WHO REFUSED TO LET THEM APPLY

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:18.920
FOR HOUSING EVEN IF THE

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:19.554
ASSISTANCE MEANS THEY CAN AFFORD

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.223
THE RENT?

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.290
I HAVE PERSONALLY COUNCIL

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.592
COUNTLESS TENANTS STRUGGLING TO

IT ON USE.

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.233
THIS IS BEEN ESPECIALLY

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.667
FRUSTRATING FOR CERTAIN GROUPS

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:33.602
OF TENANTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.203

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.938
WHO COUNT ON THIS ASSISTANCE --

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:37.672
TO SHIELD THEM FROM THE

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.608
UNCERTAINTY AND DISRUPTION OF

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:40.075

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.376

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.244
WE'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.679
SPEAKERS POWERFUL STORIES ABOUT

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.081
THE EFFECTS THAT HOUSING AND

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.617
SECURITY HOUSE ON YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:49.818
AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:52.220
FACES OF PARENTS I MET WHO WORRY.

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.054
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN BEING

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.189
DISTRACTED FROM SCHOOL AND

OR FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:00.595
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND A

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:04.966
AS WE WORK TO ADDRESS OUR

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.001
HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.402
PRIORITIZE SOLUTIONS THAT

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.904
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.672
VULNERABLE TO ITS EFFECTS.

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:11.940
BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.308
WILL TAKE TIME AND STRUGGLING

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.110
FAMILIES RIGHT NOW DON'T HAVE

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.645
TIME TO WAIT A CHILD CANNOT PUT

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:18.647
THEIR CHILDHOOD ON HOLD WHILE WE

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:21.082
BUILD ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.517
OR WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO ADJUST.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.685
AND SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW LOW

COMPONENT TO ENSURING THEIR

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.131
KEY SOLUTION THAT CAN HELP

STRUGGLING FAMILIES RIGHT NOW.

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:40.569
WHILE WE ADDRESS HOUSING SUPPLY.

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:41.469
THE BILL WOULD INSTITUTE A

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.271
PROVEN SOLUTION BY INCLUDING

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.339

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.243
ACT.

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.311
AND THE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.078
WOULD BE TO PROHIBIT

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.913
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILIES

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:52.514
BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.417
RECEIVE HOUSING ASSISTANCE.

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:56.151

SAME AS ANY OTHER FORM OF INCOME.

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:01.289
THIS MEANS THAT WHILE LANDLORDS

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:02.524
COULD STILL SCREEN ASSISTED

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.292

APPLICANT.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.263

THESE FAMILIES FROM APPLYING

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:10.565
JUST BECAUSE THEY GET HELP

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:11.866

235%.

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.078
IN ADDITION RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:24.259
ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.494
CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY ARE

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:27.962
PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION.

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:28.963
AND ARE ABLE TO GROW UP IN A

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.799

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:38.773
LOVE BUT I WANT TO KNOW THE

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.042

BILL SO I HOPE I CAN COUNT ON

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:44.779

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR --

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.528
FRONT OF YOU TODAY THAT I'LL BE

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.729
SPEAKING FROM.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:02.464
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:05.333
THE PROPER COMMENT PROGRAM WHICH

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.235
IS A SPECIFIC PROGRAM BUT IN THE

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:08.803
CONTEXT OF THIS BROADER

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.338
CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING.

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.639
ABOUT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:12.941
PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILIES WITH

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.909
CHILDREN --

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:16.044
IT SO THE PROPERTY TAX

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.479
POSTPONEMENT PROGRAM IS ONE THAT

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:18.947
IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:20.415
STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:21.916
ALLOW CERTAIN ELIGIBLE

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.551
HOMEOWNER'S. TO DEFERRED THE

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.487
PAYMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.788
INDEFINITELY.

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:27.956
THE WAY THIS WORKS IS --

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.390
A HOMEOWNER WILL APPLY TO THE

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.960
STATE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.495
THE PROGRAM THE STATE WILL PAY

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:34.796
THEIR PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:35.930
DIRECTLY ON THEIR BEHALF WITH

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:36.998
THE COUNTY.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.833
THE HOMEOWNER DOES NOT NEED TO

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.335
REPAY -- AND

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:42.036
LAST THEY MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOME

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.272
OR SELL THE HOME R THE HOME IS

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.340
AND HEARD IT OR THERE'S SOME

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:46.641
OTHER CONDITIONS --

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:47.842
BUT THE HOMEOWNER DOES

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:49.244
EVENTUALLY REPAIR THEIR ERRORS

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.613
WOULD REPAY THE STATE WITH

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:52.914
INTEREST FOR THE PROGRAM.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.148
SO TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE OF

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.451
THE HANDOUT I'M JUST TO GIVE A

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:57.886
LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS BUT TWO

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.020
IS TO START.

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.788
AND THEN ALL DELEGATED TO

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.624
SPECIFICALLY OUR EVALUATION OF

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:03.958
THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.560
AND HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY ASPECTS

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:07.562
OF THE EVALUATION IN LIGHT OF

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:08.663
THIS -- THIS

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:09.864
BROADER DISCUSSION.

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:10.865
SO -- OF

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.166
COURSE AS YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:14.202
A HOUSING IS VERY EXPENSIVE IN

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:15.870
CALIFORNIA --

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.372
PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS ARE

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:18.973
SOMEWHAT LESS SO AND THAT'S

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.975
BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:22.176
WHICH LIMITS THE GROWTH OF THE

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:23.678
ASSESSED VALUE OF A PROPERTY

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:24.779
OVER TIME.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.648
ALTHOUGH PROPERTY TAXES PAID ARE

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:29.384
STILL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE --

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:31.019
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:31.853
SO THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT%

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.522
PROGRAM HELPS OR TO THEIR

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:36.357
PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY MEET

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:37.725
CERTAIN CRITERIA.

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.527
THE FIRST IS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.195
BE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.730
BLIND OR DISABLED.

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.665
THE SECOND IS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:46.501
HAVE HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:49.504
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.838
500-355-35000 FIVE HUNDRED PER

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:51.072
MONTH.

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:53.575
PER YEAR EXCUSE ME THAT WOULD BE

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.710
CRAZY -- AND

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:56.878
FINALLY THEY HAVE TO OWN AT

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:59.280
LEAST 40% EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES.

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:00.848
SO THE TABLE AT THE BOTTOM OF

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.584
THE AGE JUST PROVIDES OUR

01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:03.851
OFFICES EVALUATION OF THIS

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.486
PROGRAM AND I'M NOT GONNA TALK

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:06.888
THROUGH EACH OF THESE --

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.256
CRITERIA SPECIFICALLY BUT JUST

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.857
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ONES THAT

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.559
ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:13.094
THIS CONVERSATION.

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:16.164
SO ON ELIGIBILITY WE FIND THAT --

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.799
THIS INCOME ELIGIBILITY

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:20.435
THRESHOLD FOR THE P. FOR PTP.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.869
IT DOES NOT VERY BY HOUSEHOLD

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:24.072
SIZE IT IS NOT VERY BY GEOGRAPHY

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.673
AND IT DOES NOT VERY OVER TIME

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.008
TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.109
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:30.411
CHALLENGES HERE THE FIRST BEING

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.579
AT THAT LARGER HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:32.780
ARE CLEARLY GOING TO NEED MORE

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:35.550
RESOURCES TO MEET THE EXPENSES --

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.251
UP ALL OF THEIR OF ALL OF THE

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.386
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM SO A

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.622
FAMILY OF SIX IS OBVIOUSLY GOING.

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.023
TO YOU KNOW PERHAPS HAVE MORE

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.791
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAN A

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:45.927
FAMILY OF ONE OR TWO AND THEN

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:47.662
ALSO WE FIND A LOWER INCOME

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:50.131
HOMEOWNERS PAY MORE AS A SHARE

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.799
OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD PROPERTY

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:54.068
TAXES IF THEY LIVE IN HIGH COST.

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:55.570
AND HIGH INCOME AREAS OF THE

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:59.173
STATE IN OTHER AREAS SO IT MIGHT

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.875
MAKE SENSE SIMILAR TO OTHER

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.477
HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR THE TOP

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.878
INCOME THRESHOLD TO VARY BY

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.781
GEOGRAPHY.

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:10.218
ON THE AGE LIMIT SPECIFICALLY WE

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:11.352
FIND THE YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.121
COULD PROBABLY BENEFIT JUST AS

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:15.423
MUCH IF NOT MORE FROM THIS

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.691
PROGRAM IS OLDER HOMEOWNERS.

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.493
TO AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:20.128
THAT -- LOW

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:21.362
INCOME HOMEOWNERS IN THEIR

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.997
FORTIES AND FIFTIES ACTUALLY PAY

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:24.666
A MUCH HIGHER SHARE OF THEIR

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:25.833
INCOME TOWARD PROPERTY TAX

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.569
PAYMENTS THAN THOSE WHO ARE OVER.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.038
SIXTY BASICALLY BECAUSE OF PROP

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:31.139
THIRTEEN AGAIN RIGHT THE LONGER

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.874
THAT YOU'VE ON THE HOME ON THE

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.742
LOWER YOUR AFFECTED PROPERTY TAX

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:35.843
PAYMENT IS GOING TO BE.

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.745
AND SO WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.280
PERHAPS THE P. T. P. INCOME

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.015
ELIGIBILITY COULD BE EXPANDED TO

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:43.685
PEOPLE BELOW THE AGE OF SIXTY

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:44.385
TWO BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.853
NEXUS HERE SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.722
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ONE BEING

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:48.756
THAT MULTI GENERATIONAL

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:50.058
HOUSEHOLDS ARE GOING TO BE LESS

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:51.592
LIKELY TO BE ABLE. TO QUALIFY

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:52.960
UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.095
OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:57.231
EVERYBODY'S INCOME IN THE

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:57.799
HOUSEHOLD COUNTS TOWARDS THE

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:58.399
LIMIT.

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:58.966
AND THE SECOND BEING THAT OF

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:00.034
COURSE CHILDREN TIME TO LIVE IN

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.069
HOMES WHERE THE HEAD OF

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:03.137
HOUSEHOLD IS UNDER THE AGE OF

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:03.871
SIXTY TWO AND SO EXPANDING THE

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.973
INCOME ARE THE AGE ELIGIBILITY.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.809
IS POSSIBLY GOING TO BENEFIT

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:10.011
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS WELL --

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:11.612
JUST QUICKLY ON AFFORDABILITY IN

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.081
THE BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF THE

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:13.881
PROGRAM.

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:17.118
THE P. T. P. INTEREST RATE IS 7%

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.953
WHICH WE FIND IS TOO HIGH --

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.388
ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOTE THAT

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:21.956
AFFORDABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM IS

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.825
ACTUALLY A BIT --

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:26.127
BETTER THAN COMPARABLE PROGRAMS

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.662
LIKE REVERSE MORTGAGES REVERSE

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:30.064
MORTGAGES TEND TO BE ACTUALLY

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.432
EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PCP.

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.201
AND ON THE BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.470
THE PROGRAM PTP DOES NOT KERRY

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.672
COST TO TAXPAYERS THAT'S BECAUSE

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.307
REPAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING LOANS

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:42.143
COVER THE COST OF MAKING NEW

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.412
LOANS TO NEW PARTICIPANTS --

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:46.914
AND ACTUALLY PTP PROVIDE THE

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.282
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT.

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:49.517
THERE IS --

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.687
A FUN TO THAT FUNDS ACCESS OF A

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.122
CERTAIN LIMIT IS SWEPT TO THE

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:55.790
GENERAL FUND SO RATHER THAN

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:56.958
GENERAL FUND TAXPAYERS

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:59.761
SUPPORTING PT PPTP IS SUPPORTING.

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:03.030
GENERAL FUND TAXPAYERS.

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:05.333
THE FINAL PAGE ARE JUST PRESENTS

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:06.701
SOME ALTERNATIVES TO CHANGE PTP

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:08.402
IN LIGHT OF THIS EVALUATION I'M

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:10.037
NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH THIS --

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:12.406
IN DETAIL FOR THE SAKE OF TIME.

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.908
BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:16.010
SPECIFIC --

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.512
IDEAS HERE ADVANCES US SOME

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.046
SPECIFIC CHANGES THAT MIGHT NEED

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.148
TO BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:22.683
AFFORDABILITY AND GENERAL FUND

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.285
SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY.

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.453
SO THE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.788
ARE MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY AS

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.723
IT EXISTS CURRENTLY CHANGING

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.158
INCOME THRESHOLD SO THAT THEY

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.926
WOULD VERY BY HOUSEHOLD SIZE ARE

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:33.795
VERY BY GEOGRAPHY AND VERY OVER

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:34.729
TIME.

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.464
POSSIBLY ALSO RAISE THE AVERAGE

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:39.500
INCOME THRESHOLD A BIT BECAUSE

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.034
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.135
HUNDRED IS QUITE LOW.

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.603
ALLOWING YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS TO

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.272
PARTICIPATE WHICH THERE ARE SOME

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.373
TECHNICAL ASPECTS HERE BUT THAT

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:46.574
COULD POSSIBLY REQUIRE A

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:49.143
CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION THIS

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.044
PROGRAM IS --

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.346
I WAS CREATED ORIGINALLY UNDER

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:53.848
THE CONSTITUTION --

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:54.949
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.651
MAKE BOTH OF THESE CHANGES SO IN

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:57.852
TERMS OF THE INTEREST RATE WE

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.420
THINK THE INTEREST RATE COULD BE

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:01.055
LOWER -- IN

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:02.523
VARIOUS PERMUTATIONS OF THIS

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.292
PROGRAM PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.194
JUST MAKING CHANGES AROUND

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.929
ELIGIBILITY OP WITH RESPECT TO

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:08.696
INCOME.

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:09.630
BUT WITH RESPECT TO ALLOWING

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:10.798
YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS TO

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.400
PARTICIPATE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.101
THIS WOULD INTRODUCE SOME

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:15.870
ADDITIONAL RISK TO THE STATE.

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:16.404
AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUNGER

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.872
HOMEOWNERS ARE GONNA TEND TO

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:19.807
HOLD THESE LOANS FOR A LONGER

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.275
AND POSSIBLY --

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:22.710
MEAN THAT THE THE VALUE OF THE

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.011
LOAN WILL EXCEED THE VALUE OF

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:26.781
THE EQUITY THAT THEY HOLD IN

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:27.748
THEIR HOME.

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:28.716
AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE JUST

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.218
A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.186
AROUND LIMITING STATE RISK --

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:34.088
AT THAT COULD KEEP THE FIND

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.890
GENERALLY SELF FUNDED AS IT IS

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.525
CURRENTLY --

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.961
BUT IT ALSO EITHER OF THESE OP

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:41.696
ELIGIBILITY COULD REQUIRE ONE

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:44.465
TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT JUST --

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:45.900
TO ON A SHORT TERM BASIS TO

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:47.935
ALLOW -- THE

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:48.970
INCREASED ELIGIBILITY AN

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:50.304
INCREASED PARTICIPATION

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.406
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM TO

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.809
STABILIZE OVER TIME SO --

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.310
WITHOUT A BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:58.512
QUESTIONS.

01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:00.715
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.884
HAVE BEEN JOINED BY CENTER TYLER.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:06.354
QUICK QUESTION --

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.022
BUDGET PARTICIPATION YOUR CHART

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.757
SAYS IS VERY LOW AROUND A

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:10.958
THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS IN THE

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.660
MOST RECENT YEAR.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:13.561
IS THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SO

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:16.130
NARROWLY DEFINED WHO QUALIFIES

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.498
LACK ABOUT REACH WHY DO YOU

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:18.799
THINK THAT IS YEAH --

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:21.002
THERE'S A COUPLE ISSUES HERE SO

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.303
DESPITE THE FACT THAT OVER A

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:26.774
MILLION CALIFORNIANS QUALIFY FOR

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:27.909
THIS PROGRAM I'M HERE --

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:28.743
ONLY A THOUSAND PARTICIPATED IN

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:29.977
THE MOST RECENT YEAR ONE ISSUE

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.679
IS THAT THE PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:35.216
EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.218
SIX I BELIEVE OR NINETEEN

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:38.085
SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY SIX BUT IT

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:41.055
WAS SUSPENDED IN --

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:42.990
TWO THOUSAND NINE AS A RESULT OF

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:44.325
GENERAL FUND BUDGET PRESSURE AND

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:46.494
THEN IT WAS REINSTATED IN TWENTY

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.628
FOURTEEN AND SO PART OF THE

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:49.297
ISSUE THERE MIGHT JUST BE THE

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.197
FACT THAT THE PROGRAM WAS

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.565
SUSPENDED AND REINSTATED MEANS

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.134
THAT AWARENESS IS LOWER THAN IT

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.201
COULD BE --

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:55.536
BUT ALSO PART OF IT MIGHT BE

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:56.904
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY COULD

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:58.239
BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM THE

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.207
MOST DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:02.109
TO ACCESS IT.

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:03.811
WHAT WHAT WE CONSIDER ALL OF THE

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.680
MONEY WE SPEND AN OUT REACH FOR

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:08.182
EITC THE NEW STATE IN EARNED

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:09.317
INCOME TAX CREDIT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:10.418
THIS WOULD BE?

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.653
A ANOTHER VIABLE TOOL THAT WE

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.754
NEED TO PROBABLY DIRECT FROM

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:15.556
RESOURCES ONE MORE QUICK

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.391
QUESTION --

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:18.292
OPEN UP FROM MY COLLEAGUES.

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:21.095
THE 40% EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES TO

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.296
SEE ME HE SAID YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:25.132
CALCULATE AND MY 40% EQUITY YET

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.133
PROBABLY NOT.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.202
BUT IF YOU MOVE TO A YOUNGER

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:30.171
POPULATION WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:31.305
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:31.706
THAT.

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.342
CRITERIA I'D BE CONCERNED YEAH

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.177
ABSOLUTELY SO --

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.144
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.612
CRITERIA IS REASONABLE FOR THE

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:40.414
CURRENT POPULATION IS THAT

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:41.649
THEY'RE OLDER AND SO THEY'VE ON

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:42.483
THEIR HOMES FOR A LONGER.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:43.617
YEAH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:46.253
WE'VE CONSIDERED AN THOUGHT THAT

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.688
YOU MIGHT NEED TO LOWER THAT

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:49.023
THRESHOLD IF --

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.124
YOU WANTED TO CHANGE THE AGE

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.959
ELIGIBILITY THAT WOULD AGAIN

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.461
INTRODUCED MORE STATE RISK SO

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.762
THERE'S REALLY JUST A BALANCING

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:56.364
ACT THERE BETWEEN --

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:57.898
ENSURING THAT THIS THE PROGRAM

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.834
HAS ENOUGH FUNDING TO CONTINUE --

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.202
AS A RESULT OF ALL THE VARIOUS

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.603
RISKS THAT IT FACES BUT THEN

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.238
ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.773
ACCESS.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.808
EXCELLENT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.377
SOME TO CABALLERO THANK YOU

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.712
MADAM CHAIR.

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.948
I'M I I IN I APOLOGIZE IF THIS

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.349
ISN'T THE RIGHT JOB HEARING TO

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:18.519
HAVE THIS QUESTION BUT I I AM.

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:20.221
THAT I WANTED TO ASK --

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:23.491
MR HARDIN ON SB THREE TWENTY

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:24.091
NINE NINE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.427
YOUR BILL BUT I I WAS VERY --

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.929
INTRIGUED BY THE TESTIMONY OF

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:32.033
ELDER MCNEIL AS SHE TESTIFIED TO

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:34.769
THE SHENANIGANS THAT WERE PLAYED

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.337
WITH THEIR SECTION.

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:40.741
EIGHT AND AND I'M WONDERING.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:41.909
BECAUSE IT IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.444
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:44.945
SAY THOU SHALT NOT.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:45.546
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:50.551
MAKE -- A IT

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.186
WE WE USE THE DEFINITION AND

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:55.122
UNDER THREE TWENTY NINE BUT SOME

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.458
OF THAT MAY BE.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:01.195
AT IT UNLAWFUL FOR THEM TO DO.

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:03.064
AND THEN WE WOULD WANT TO COME

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.832
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CREATE

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:07.268
PENALTIES IF PEOPLE PLAY AROUND

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.869
WITH YEAH I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:10.838
SECTION --

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:11.872
EIGHT BUT YOU CAN GET THE PAPER

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.307
PAPERWORK RIGHT OR YES I'M GONNA

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.376
TAKE IT BUT NOW I'M I HAVE NOT

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.544
PAID.

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:18.212
THE MORTGAGE AND YOU CAN BE

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.581
TURNED OUT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.049
HOURS I MEAN THAT THAT PART OF

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.751
THE STORY REALLY ANGERED ME AND

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:25.186
I I KNOW WE'VE HEARD THOSE KINDS

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.321
OF STORIES WORKING IN LEGAL AID

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:28.389
FOR MANY YEARS.

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:30.357
THE QUESTION IS CAN WE PUT TEETH

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:31.992
IN SOMETHING.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:33.461
SO IF YOU DO IT.

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:34.995
YOU'RE PAYING A BIGGER PENALTY

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:37.364
DOWN THE ROAD AND AND THERE ARE

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:38.299
THEIR CONSEQUENCE ALMOST

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:39.767
WONDERING IF THE IF IF IF IT'S

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:40.835
NOT IN THERE IS THERE SOMETHING

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.837
WE CAN ADD SO THAT WE DON'T NEED

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.138
TO CHANGE THE FEDERAL.

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:47.441
LAW WE JUST ADD OUR OWN

01:35:47.508 --> 01:35:48.442
PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.511
RIGHT WELL I THINK I THINK.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:51.912
THERE THERE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCES

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.214
WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.316
HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS PLICY --

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.750
AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.719
ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:01.188
AND NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME THINK.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:02.790
IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MANY

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.125
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS UNDER THIS

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.527
KIND OF A POLICY TAKE FOR THE

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.761
MESSAGE TO GET SENT THAT.

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.163
YOU KNOW LANDLORDS NEED TO TREAT

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.865
THIS FAMILY IS THE SAME AS AS

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:12.299
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY OTHER SOURCE

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:14.201
OF INCOME --

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:15.636
AND SANTA MONICA HAS HAD A

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:17.705
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL EFFORT --

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.440
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL LEGAL

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.242
AID PROGRAMS --

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:21.842
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT TENANTS

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:24.578
ARE SPECTER THAN THAT AND THAT

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:25.980
THEY'RE ACTUALLY THIS POLICY IS

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:26.947
LEADING TO THEM.

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:28.282
TRULY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:32.853
HOUSING UNITS.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.256

GIVEN US LOTS OF FOOD FOR

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.362
THOUGHT WE ALWAYS LIKE TO

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:42.830
INCLUDE IN OUR HEARINGS ACTUAL

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:44.465
SOLUTION SO WE YOU KNOW DON'T

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.734
