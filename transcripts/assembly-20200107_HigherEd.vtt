00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.155
WHY WE SUPPORT THIS BILL ALL

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.091
QUICKLY VERY VERY BRIEFLY

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.560
IDENTIFIED THREE. THE FIRST IS

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.261
THAT THIS BELT WOULD ENABLE

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.096
MORE STUDENTS ACTUALLY ENROLL

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.931
IN THESE PROGRAMS TO ENTER THIS

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.100
FIELD ALTHOUGH. THERE ARE SOME

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:08.967
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO OFFER

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.970
SIMILAR PROGRAMS BECAUSE MOST

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:12.904
DO NOT HAVE EITHER THE

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.640
RESOURCES OR THE EXPERTISE TO

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:15.941
ACTUALLY CREATE THESE THIS

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.076
CURRICULUM FROM SCRATCH. THIS

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.045
WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW. A TASK

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.279
FORCE OF EXPERTS TO COME UP

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.814
WITH A BASE STANDARD CURRICULUM

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.716
THAT THEY COULD- THAT WOULD

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.385
ALLOW THEM TO MORE EASILY AND

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.420
QUICKLY IMPLEMENT THIS

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.155
CURRICULUM IN THESE COURSES AT

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:33.091
THEIR INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES-

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:36.061
SECOND IS THAT. THIS WAY-

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.596
CREATE REAL JOBS NOT JUST

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.731
AGREES THAT BY AT REQUIRING

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.733
THAT THIS CURRICULUM INCLUDES

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.435
CLEAR PARTNERSHIPS WITH A

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:44.970
DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE STATE

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.238
PARKS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.873
PROFITS LIKE COMMUNITY NATURE

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.941
CONNECTION. IT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:21:50.008 --> 00:21:52.577
CREATE CLEAR PATHWAYS INTO JOBS

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.413
AT THOSE DIFFERENT SITES. AND

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.348
THEN THIRD I THINK IT'S

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.083
BECOMING UNFORTUNATELY CLEAR

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.085
THAT THERE IS A LACK OF WORK

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:00.752
FORCE IN THIS NATURALIST

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:04.189
CAREER- THERE ARE LOTS OF YOU

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:07.859
KNOW NEEDS LOTS OF- DISASTERS

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.061
THAT ARE HAPPENING Là TO PARK

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:12.397
CITY TO BE. LOTS SAYS THAT NEED

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.800
TO BE PROTECTED AND NOT MERELY

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:16.868
A ENOUGH WORK FORCE TO ACTUALLY

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:19.705
BE READY TO DROP CAREER SO THIS

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:23.442
WOULD ACTUALLY ENABLE- ANY HE

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:28.613
DID AN AYE. DADDY I FORCE TO

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.614

ARE AWARE THAT THIS IS A

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:00.558
POSSIBILITY AT THE COMMUNITY

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.961
COLLEGES. SO ENTITIES ENTITIES

00:26:03.028 --> 00:26:04.529
ALIKE IN NATURAL CONSERVATION.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:07.032
WOULD PREFER SOMEBODY WHO

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.300
FOCUSED ON THIS KIND OF A

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.402
STUDY. SO THAT'S WHAT I GET.

00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:12.637
YEAH SO I WOULD ACTUALLY- THERE

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:14.339
ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS LIKE THIS

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.907
THAT DO EXIST WHEN I WOULD

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:17.742
POINT NOW IS THE UC NATURALIST

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:20.345
PROGRAM- WHAT. THE INTENTION

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:21.613
REALLY AS THERE IS TO BOTH

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.448
INFORM STUDENTS THAT THIS IS AN

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:24.883
OPPORTUNITY AND THIS IS A

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.217
CAREER PATH THAT DOES ACTUALLY

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:28.186
LEAD TO. SUSTAINABLE AND

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.956
FAMILY- SUSTAINING JOBS. SO

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.157
WHAT IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DO IS

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:32.991
IT WOULD CREATE A SPACE FOR

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:34.192
THEM TO START BECOMING

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.629
INFORMED- INFORM THEM ABOUT

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:38.863
WHAT THOSE CERTIFICATIONS AND

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.465
TYPES OF JOBS. WOULD BE. AND

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.433
THAT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.268
ACTUALLY REQUIRE THEM TO.

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:45.036
PARTNER WITH LOCAL OR STATE OR

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.838
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT COULD

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.473
COME IN AND ACTUALLY CONNECT

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.709
THEM TO PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF THE

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.643
COLLEGE. THAT COULD THEN

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.912
PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT.

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:54.980
CERTIFICATIONS THE TRAIN THE ON

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:57.482
THE GROUND- WORK AND THE ACTUAL

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.317
CAREER PATHWAYS AN ACTUAL JOB

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:01.353
PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. TO

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.190
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SO FOR THE

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.625
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WHEN THE-

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:09.160
OUR FOCUS ON THIS CURRICULUM

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:11.029
THEN THEY WILL GRADUATE THE

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:15.300
WITH THE A DEGREE IN. SOMETHING

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:15.867
THAT TORE STATUS THAT IS SET

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:18.737
DROUGHT WHITE. WE THIS IS

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.005
ACTUALLY NOT CREATING A DEGREE

00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:22.173
IT'S UNTIL IS A SO WHAT I MEAN

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.475
I THINK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:25.043
IS IT GONNA BE WHAT THE

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.612
CERTIFICATION WHAT IS IT. SO I

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.114
THINK THAT IT WOULD REALLY BE

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.216
IT- UP TO THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:27:31.282 --> 00:27:33.118
OFFICE AND THEN THAT TASK FORCE

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:34.686
THAT'S IT REALLY IDENTIFYING

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.888
WHAT IS THAT INTEREST AND WHAT

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.056
IS WHAT IT WHAT ARE THEY

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:40.425
ACTUALLY AVAILABLE AND WHAT IF

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.393
THEY WANT TO OFFER TO THE

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:43.528
STUDENTS I COULD SEE THAT TEY

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:44.396
COULD PROBABLY DECIDE THAT THEY

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.897
WOULD DO YOU WANT TO OFFER

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:48.366
MUCH- HIGHER DEGREES HERE OR IT

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:49.367
COULD BE. MORE OF A KIND OF

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:52.337
CONNECTION COURSE SO I THINK-

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:53.872
BY ALLOWING THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:56.107
OFFICE AND THEN I THINK IT'S

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:57.675
CALLED THE SENATE- CHANCELLOR'S

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.377
OFFICE SENATE OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.578
THAT THAT'S CAN ACTUALLY

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:03.548
APPROVED THAT CURRICULUM IT AND

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.216
BRING IN EXPERTS WHO ARE IN

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.818
THIS FIELD AND KIND OF KNOW HOW

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:07.786
TO CREATE A CURRICULUM AND ARE

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:08.953
OUT ON THE FIELD DOING THIS

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.889
TYPE OF WORK. BY REQUIRING THAT

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.257
THEY ALL COME TOGETHER TO

00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:13.391
DEVELOP THE CURRICULUM I THINK

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.560
THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD REALLY

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:16.961
IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE DEGREES

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:19.297
THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO OFFER

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.833
IS THAT NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.369
THAT'S TANGIBLE ARE VIABLE OR

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.504
THAT FOLKS ARE INTERESTED IN OR

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:27.505
HAVE WHAT DIRECTION THEY WANT

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:27.939
TO GO OUT. INTO CREE

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:28.907
FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE ANSWERS

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:29.607
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:31.676
CREATE SOMETHING THAT FITS THEM

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:33.511
BUT ENSURING THAT THERE IS AT

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:35.747
LEAST SOME SORT OF AN AVENUE

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:38.683
THAT WE ARE INFORMING. THE

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.284
STUDENTS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.621
OF NATURAL AS OF THE CAREER-

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.189
BUT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.324
FLEXIBILITY HERE SO THAT. NOT A

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.227
ONE SIZE FITS ALL. NO I DO SEE

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:50.395
A OF GREAT POTENTIAL THAT THE

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.729
GOOD CURRICULUM CAN BE

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:54.799
DEVELOPED- AND THEN I'M COMING

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:56.968
FROM A CITY OF FOUR OR FIVE WAY

00:28:57.035 --> 00:29:00.371
A ONE THIRD OF ALL CITY IS OPEN

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:01.139
SPACE AND THEN APPLYING

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:04.509
CONSERVATION CORPS. I'M IN THE

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.844
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO HOW TO

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.412
MAINTAIN AND THE OR SO AT THE

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:10.181
SAME TIME TO MAKE IT OPEN TO

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:12.684
THE PUBLIC TO ENJOY SO TO GET

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.354
THE GOOD BALANCE. AND THE

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.455
UTILIZING THE VOLUNTEERS IN

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:19.591
ALL. THAT ALONE WOULD REQUIRE

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.426
SOME SOME LEVEL OF SKILL SET.

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:23.528
SO IF FOR THIS IS A INTRODUCED

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:26.898
A FOR SOMEBODY. I WOULD LIKE TO

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.700

DEGREE IN COLLEGE THEN THE FOR

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:34.372

BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THIS-

NATURALLY SCORES OF THIS IS

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.546
SOMETHING I THINK FOR A TO

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.381
THINK ABOUT AS A NEXT STEP. I

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:44.449
DEMAND THAT SEPARATING THE

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:46.317
DIRECTION THAT WE ARE TAKING

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:47.385

AWARE THAT THIS IS EVEN AN

00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:57.762
OPTION TO THINK ABOUT A DEGREE

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:59.330
AND THAT THEY STEP TO COULD BE

00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:00.265
TAKING. AT THE COMMUNITY

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:02.800
COLLEGE BEFORE THEY TRANSFER TO

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:05.103
