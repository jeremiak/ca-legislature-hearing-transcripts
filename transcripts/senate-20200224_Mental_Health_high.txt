SELECT COMMITTEE ON MENTAL HEALTH OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE AND THIS IS OUR FIRST SELECT COMMITTEE MEETING OF THE YEAR AND I LIKE TO WELCOME- THE PANELISTS WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO PREPARE FOR THIS HEARING AND- THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING WITH US. NOW WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S DOES A LOT TO DO TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THINK ALL OF US ARE FEELING OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOME DID A REALLY GOOD JOB EXPRESSING A SERIOUS- COMMITMENT TO DOING SOMETHING ABOUT BRAIN HEALTH HE MADE A VERY SERIOUS STATEMENT LAST WEEK. DURING HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. ANY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T SEPARATE FROM PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND HE'S MAKING INVESTMENTS IN OVERHAULING INTEGRATING OUR SYSTEMS IN THE PAST ARE HEARINGS A FOCUS ON THE GAPS AND PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE ARE TAKING A INTO A LITTLE DIFFERENT TURN IN TODAY'S HEARING HEARING IS NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGE BUT WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS. TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND WE HOPE IT WILL INSPIRE YOU TO EXPAND YOUR PARTNERSHIPS AND COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE PATHWAYS TO ADDRESS GAPS IN OUR SERVICES THERE IS WILL FOCUS ON YOUTH AND FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH AND- WE'RE GONNA- HERE HAVE PLAYED TIMES FOR COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. AT THE END OF THE HEARING. AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU ALL WE'RE GOING TO START I'D LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR JOHN CONLEY- FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HE'S GOING TO FOCUS ON DISCUSSING- TRENDS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND WELCOME AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU-HAD THE JOB AT ALL- JUST A LITTLE. FIVE WELL THAT'S GREAT I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU GLAD TO BE HERE. CAN WELCOME CENTER MONNING AND YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE FOR FIRST OF ALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE VITAL ISSUE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY SHARE BOTH THE POLICY COMMITMENT IN A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUES- AND THAT COMMITMENT WAS EVIDENCE BOTH IN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS THAT BUT YOU MENTIONED LAST WEEK- IT PROBABLY GOES WITHOUT SAYING FOR MANY IN THE ROOM BUT I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS CENTRAL TO LIVING A HAPPY. HEALTHY AND FULFILLING LIFE AND WITH EACH PASSING YEAR. COURAGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THIS TRUTH. AND IN BUILDING SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATMENT AND RECOVERY. AND BUILDING SUPPORT OF COMMUNITIES THAT BOTH PREVENT AND FIGHT STIGMA SURROUNDING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. STILL WE HAVE A DISTANCE TO GO TO ENSURE THAT ALL HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY NEED. MOREOVER WE HAVE MUCH WORK AHEAD TO REALIZE THE VISION. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. RECEIVING THE SUPPORT EMBRACE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT FEAR OF MARGINALIZATION A CRITICAL FACTOR IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINING AND CELEBRATING RECOVERY. IN FACT CALIFORNIA'S NOW GRAPPLING WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS WHICH INCLUDE BOTH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS OR S. U. D. DIE EARLIER AND ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED OR HOMELESS THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS. MOREOVER PEOPLE WITH A SEMI AN S. U. D. AND YOUTH WITH A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISORDER. ARE AT GREATER RISK OF SUICIDE WHICH IS INCREASED MARKEDLY IN RECENT YEARS IN FACT HOSPITALIZATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS INCREASED 50% AMONG CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN- CLEARLY THE SITUATION IS URGENT. AND ALARMING. A FURTHER TOO MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CANNOT RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THEY NEED THEM. AND WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVE CARE THEY TOO OFTEN FIND IT INADEQUATE. FRAGMENTED AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. AND UNCOORDINATED WITH OUR OTHER HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. GIVEN THIS REALITY THE MAJOR QUESTION BEFORE US IS HOW TO CHANGE THIS EXPERIENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND TO ME THE CONSIDERABLE NEED THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES. ALL OFFER A FEW SUGGESTIONS TODAY AREAS OF FOCUS THAT WOULD HELP US CREATE A DIFFERENT REALITY. AND OFFER HOPE IN A GREATER CHANCE OF RECOVERY TO CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. FIRST ONE AREA OF FOCUS IS PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICES. WELCOME CENTER- TO THE FOR- ATTENTION TO THE FRONT DOOR- FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AN APPARENT TO THOSE WHO NEED SERVICES THAT INCLUDES HEALTH PLANS. INCLUDING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS AND THEIR NETWORKS OF SERVICE PROVIDERS- WHICH SHOULD OFFER CENTRALIZED HUMAN CENTERED SYSTEMS FOR SWIFTLY LINKING PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY TO BE NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE IN EACH REGION OR COUNTY. MOREOVER THE CONSTELLATION OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY SHOULD PROVIDE AS MANY TOUCH POINTS AS POSSIBLE WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE CONNECTIONS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT INCLUDES EDUCATION HOUSING PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER SHOULD HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING AND A CONSCIOUS CONNECTION TO THE FRONT DOOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE THROUGH LOCAL HEALTH COVERAGE OPTIONS AND COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THE SCHOOL ALSO REQUIRES MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WITH A BROADER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE SHOULD NOT PLACE TREMENDOUS ONUS OF NAVIGATING AND COORDINATING CARE ON VULNERABLE CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE IN TIMES OF CRISIS AND ILLNESS- EXPERIENCING MANY CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE US TO REACH OUT TO THEM RATHER THAN THE CONVERSE. IF WE STRIVE TO ESTABLISH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE IS A VITAL ACCESSIBLE HUMAN CENTERED RESOURCE WE MUST INTEGRATE A MORE BROADLY WITH WITH MODELS OF CARE THAT SORT OF THE WHOLE PERSON NOT JUST PART OF THEIR NEEDS. WE NEED PROVIDER NETWORKS TO CREATE TEAMS OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS CASE MANAGER SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS TO PROVIDE A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH TO CARE. MEANINGFUL INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WILL REQUIRE DEEPER COORDINATION ACROSS DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY WORKING TOGETHER THAT INCLUDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CITIES. COUNTIES HOUSING AUTHORITIES JUVENILE JUSTICE CHILD WELFARE AND OTHER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE ALL SERVING IN COMMON ACROSS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN DIFFERENT- SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. MISALIGNMENT SHOULD INCLUDE AN INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON SERVING THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES AND PRIORITIZE INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE MODELS THAT MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE WORK AND PLAY. AS WELL AS WORSHIP. MOREOVER WE MUST DESIGN THESE CROSS SYSTEM COLLABORATIONS WITH THE INTENTION OF MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDING AND STRATEGICALLY USING OUR STATE AND LOCAL DOLLARS TO MAXIMIZE SERVICE CAPACITY. HOW DO WE DO THAT A FUSE A FEW AREAS OF FOCUS FIRST WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS AN IMPORTANT AN INDISPENSIBLE WAY OF BUILDING OUR CAPACITY IT'S A MAJOR ONGOING AREA OF FOCUS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE CAPACITY TO SERVE RESIDENTS IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE OF THE STATE WITH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING THAT REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AND LARGE AND A WORK FORCE THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IS A AN IMPORTANT AND CIVIL STRATEGY TO PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO SERVICES IT ALSO ENABLES PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE AND ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTS ARE THERAPEUTIC. FURTHER THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH PRESENTS A COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGY TO EXPAND THE REACH OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. IS WHERE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF CLINICAL CAPACITY- FOR CLINICIANS OF THAT TYPE. IF YOU REALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND FOR GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES WITH SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES ARE NEEDS. TELEHEALTH ALSO PROVIDES A KEY MEANS OF INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WITH PRIMARY AND OTHER SPECIALTY CARE BUILDING VIRTUAL TEAMS THROUGH CASE CONFERENCING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION SHARING. THE STEPS ARE DESCRIBED WILL HELP US PROVIDE GREATER STE- ACCESS TO SERVICES OF COURSE THE DETAILS ARE COMPLEX AND IMPORTANT BUT WE MUST ALSO GAIN A STRONGER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TYPES OF CARE THAT WORK BEST ACROSS OUR STATE HEALTH PLANS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. SHOULD MOVE TOWARD MORE STANDARDIZED METRICS TO ENSURE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WELL OUR SYSTEMS ARE SERVING CALIFORNIANS. THROUGH ENHANCED DATA COLLECTION INCONSISTENT MEASUREMENT WE CAN BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEED BY EXPANDING INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK AND- THE MOST URGENT GAPS IN SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE LEARNED THAT EARLY INTERVENTION AND ONGOING SUPPORT PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AND HOPE FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCING A MERGING MENTAL ILLNESS. COORDINATED SPECIALTY CARE IS A TIMELY EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AFTER THE EXPERIENCE THE FIRST EPISODE OF PSYCHOSIS AND WE KNOW THAT IT GREATLY IMPROVES. THEIR LONG TERM WELL BEING AND OUTCOMES THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT OFFER THESE SERVICES TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. ENHANCE DATA COLLECTION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE SERVICES WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO EXPAND THEIR USE IN OTHER EFFECTIVE PRACTICES. TO IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH. AND POPULATION HEALTH LEADS ME TO MIKE INCLUDING- POINTS WHICH IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE JUST LIKE NUTRITION AND EXERCISE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A CENTRAL PLANK OF HUMAN WELL BEING. WE MUST CONTINUALLY ASSESS TRENDS IN IN NEED RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FROM A POPULATION HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. AND THE POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF THOSE DYNAMICS DESERVE EXAMINATION. TO INFORM AND SHARP IN OUR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES. IMPROVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT WHICH WOULD BENEFIT FROM ALL OF THE STRATEGIES THAT I MENTIONED TODAY AND OTHERS. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO REALIZING THE VISION OF A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THANK YOU. UNLIKE DOWN SOME ROOM JUST. TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE TRUCK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF RELATIONSHIP ON MENTAL HEALTH- INVOLVES- CAL A NAME WHICH IS YOUR MEDICARE ALL AGREEMENT AND THERE'S BLOCK RANCH THE- RECEIPT. FOR SERVICES TO BOOST TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OF WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING IN TERMS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA CAN YOU GIVE US KIND OF AN UPDATE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE ACCOUNT NAME AND SURE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH- A BLOCK GRANT THE BLOCK GRANTS OR OTHER. OTHER AREAS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND THOSE THOSE TWO AREAS. SURE SO- TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS WITH CAROLINE IN THE PROPOSAL FOR THE WAIVER RENEWALS AND BROADER MEDICAL TRANSFORMATION THAT PROGRESS IS KIND OF IN THE THICK OF A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT. WORK GROUPS THAT ARE ON GOING TO GET FEEDBACK ABOUT THE INITIAL PROPOSAL RELEASED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO- THE PROPOSALS ARE BEING REFINED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEMBERS OF THOSE WORK GROUPS AND WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS- THAT FEEDBACK WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN UPDATED ROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED FOR SUBMISSION TO. THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES- I THINK THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN GOOD AND FRUITFUL THE ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN REAL AND THERE HAVE BEEN REVISIONS BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS RECEIVED. I THINK- ONE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE IS RELATED TO THE STATE OPIOID RESPONSE GRANT WHICH IS A FEDERAL GRANT APART FROM THE USUAL- SAM'S A BLOCK GRANT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. AND WE'RE UPDATING OUR PROPOSAL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THAT FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM SAM SO- TO FOCUS ON MANY OF THE ACUTE NEEDS THAT ARE RELATED TO- ARE OPIOID RESPONSE BUT ALSO HOPEFULLY HAVING MORE CREATIVE RESPONSES. THAT REFLECT THE FACT THAT METHAMPHETAMINE OVERDOSE RATES HAVE EXCEEDED- OPIOID OVERDOSE RATES. ARE YOU ARE YOU LOOKING. TO COMPETITIVE GRANTS THAT THE OFFER. IN WHAT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THOSE THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES I'D HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SEE WHAT WHAT APPLICATIONS THEY MIGHT BE CONSIDERING BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU SENATOR OF WE WANT TO HAVE. I GUESS A- RELATIONSHIP WITH FAMILIES IN SCHOOLS IMPROVED CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL AGE AT THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WHAT IS BEING DONE TO STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTIONS OF PROVIDING- MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SURE I THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP AND POINT AND I THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT AS A FORMER EDUCATOR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER. UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ALIGNMENT OF BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM WE HAVE SOME TEACHERS HERE OR JUST ONE I THOUGHT IT OUT OF POINT THAT OUT WONDERFUL GLAD TO HAVE SPREAD TO HAVE A RUBIO WAS A TEACHER AND CEREMONY RIGHT THAT'S WONDERFUL. YOUR TEACHER THE HOUSE WAS A BAD STUDENT. GLAD TO HAVE ALLIES EDUCATE HERE OKAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT SO. I THINK WE ARE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TO BETTER ALIGN WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING THROUGH MANY OF OUR COUNTY SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS POSSIBLY ALSO THROUGH. THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN TERMS OF SERVICES THEY MAY BEOFFERING TO YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AS WELL- AND TWO CHILDREN. AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN ALIGN WHAT'S IN THOSE BENEFITS PACKAGES WHAT CAN BE DELIVERED ON SCHOOL SITES ON TO MY COMMENTS THAT WERE PREPARED HERE. IF WE CAN MEET STUDENTS AND USE WHERE THEY ARE AND A MORE INTEGRATED FASHION- WHICH FOR MOST STUDENTS IS SCHOOL THAT'S WHERE THEY SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR DAYS- I THINK THAT WILL BE A REALLY FRUITFUL EFFORT AND SO. I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT WHATEVER PROGRAMMING WERE WERE LAUNCHING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL OR WHATEVER WE'RE DOING THROUGH THE WAIVER PROPOSALS THAT WE ARE- BEING STRATEGIC AND HOW WE INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES. TO ALIGN MORE CLOSELY WITH THEIR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YEAH I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AREA WE HAVE THE SURGEON GENERAL IN TALKING ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND- HOW THAT AFFECTS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS. LIKE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT. ABILITY OFTHE TEACHERS TO TEACH IN A CLASSROOM WITH KIDS THAT HAVE. BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE HANDLED. APPROPRIATELY THERAPEUTICALLY. AND IT THERE A STRONG LAW. TO WE NEED. WITH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A VERY WORTHWHILE GOAL AND I SHOULD MENTION TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS OPERATIONALIZE IN SOME FUNDING. FOR INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS TO DO THE KIND OF INNOVATIVE WORK THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SO I THINK. ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO THINK OF HOW OUR TOOLS THROUGH MEDICAL TRANSFORMATION HELP US TO DO THAT WORK AND TO SITUATE THE CLINICIANS THAT THAT ARE PREPARED TO SERVE YOUTH PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WITHIN THEIR SCHOOLS AND MEETING THEM. AGAIN WHERE THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME. SOME AND NOW I'D LIKE TO ASSN AREA ABOUT- AN AREA I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THAT SO. THE ISSUE OF PEER SUPPORT SYSTEMS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED IN NOW FORTY EIGHT STATES ARE HAVING ON YOUR SUPPORT- CERTIFICATE. ASSESSES AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT IS THE PROGRESS ON THAT- THAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT ISSUE. I THINK THAT WE ALIGN WITH A GOAL OF HAVING A MORE PURE SUPPORT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS- I THINK THE ISSUE IS HOW TO FINANCE THAT AND CLEARLY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THAT. THANK YOU OF SENATOR MORNING. CENTER MORE ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PRE SHEET YEAR ORGANIZING THIS DOCTOR CONELLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IN WORK. ONE OF FOCUS YOU YOU OUTLINED BROADLY SOLUTION AREAS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN TELE MEDICINE TELEHEALTH- TO HAVE ANY MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WERE THE ADMINISTRATION SCHOOLS WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK ONE AREA I CAN JUST SPEAK BROADLY ABOUT AREAS WHERE I THINK WE SEE NEED IN WHERE TELL HEALTH COULD BE HELPFUL CERTAINLY WE HAVE A SHORTAGE IN MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE. OF CLINICIANS WHO CONSERVE YOUTH WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS A SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS OF COURSE BUT ALSO OTHERS AND IF THERE AE WAYS THAT WE CONNECT- RESOURCE RICH CENTERS OR FACILITIES WITH AREAS OF THE STATE REMOTELY THROUGH TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD I THINK BE A VERY FRUITFUL ENDEAVOR. YEAH AND I AGREE WITH THAT TO A POINT ONE OF MY CONCERNS I REPRESENT A RURAL AREA OF THE CHAIR MENTIONS THEWORK OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ON ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES- OFTEN A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN- CLINICIAN. CAN DETERMINE THAT A CHILD IS FACING CHALLENGES BUT THERE'S NOT AVAILABLE- MULTICULTURAL MULTI LINGUAL RESOURCES- TELEHEALTH MAY HELP BRIDGE THAT GAP. BUT I ALSO SHARE CONCERN THAT WE NOT. LOW IF YOU WILL. ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ONLY THROUGH TELEMEDICINE- TELEHEALTH THERE'S GONNA BE CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT JUST IN MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH BUT ALSO IN. IN OTHER HEALTH WHERE. TELEMEDICINE IS NOT THE SOLUTION HEADING HEADING YOU HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THAT WE DON'T JUST SEE TELEHEALTH IS THE PANACEA AND THEN RELEGATE PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS SUPPORT COMMUNITIES TO THEIR ONLY INTERACTION BEING ON A VIDEO SCREEN. SURE AND I I'VE I SHARE THAT VIEW I THINK THAT TELL HEALTH IS ONE TOOL THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING AND USING WHEN APPROPRIATE. AND IT CAN ALSO BE USED NOT JUST FOR DIRECT SERVICE DELIVERY BUT ALSO CONSULTATION WITH PRACTITIONERS WHO MAY BE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS- MAYBE PEDIATRICIANS ARE OTHER PROVIDERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SUCH THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN GAIN SOME EXPERTISE FROM A SPECIALIST TO MAY BE SITUATED REMOTELY- SO WE DON'T REPLACE THAT THAT IN PERSON- SERVICE- RELATIONSHIP OR THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE THAT MAYBE THERE. IN ADDITION I THINK- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCENTIVIZE CLINICIANS TO RECEIVE TRAINING AND TO PRACTICE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO THINGS THAT- THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR HAS EXPLORED AND THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT AS WELL IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE THAT WE CAN EXPLORE. AGAIN DEVELOPING THE FOLKS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS TO LIVE EXPERIENCE- PROVIDE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE IN RESPONSE OF TREATMENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALSO VERY WORTHWHILE GOAL BUT THINK ALSO IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC BUDGET- FOCUS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CAN YOU SHARE ANY OF THOSE. INITIATIVES WITH THIS I THINK WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN IT WE REALIZE THAT IT IS A PRIMARY NEED AND AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF PROVIDING MORE CAPACITY FOR- THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE IN THE PEOPLE THAT. THAT ARE- NOT NECESSARILY ACCESS ACCESSING COORDINATED- AND TIMELY SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE SO IT'S AN AREA OF FOCUS THERE ARE AND I THINK A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT WERE EXPLORING. BUT AGAIN OPEN TO CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT ONE IS WE HAVE A PROGRAMS WE'VE HAD PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT. PHYSICIANS TO HELP WITH LOAN REPAYMENT IF THEY- PURSUE THEIR RESIDENCY TRAINING OR PRACTICE IN RURAL OR UNDERSERVED AREAS- THAT'S BEEN A FIGHT. TO KEEP THE THAT FUNDING IN OUR BUDGET I HOPE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SUPPORT. NOT JUST RETAINING THAT BIT. LOOKING TO HOW WE MIGHT INCREASE THAT IN BEYOND JUST PHYSICIAN TRAINING. IN RETENTION AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS COME IN AND FINELY DECEIT MINISTRATION HAVE ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS. LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE- RESIDENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING FORMS OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INCLUDING. MEDIC COUNT FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE- THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST THEM IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS HAD IS THAT SPILL OVER TO PEOPLE BEING FEARFUL OF PURSUING- AVAILABLE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELING SERVICES TREATMENT BUT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMPEDIMENT DID YOU PURSUE THIS TREATMENT OR YOUR CHILD A US CITIZEN CHILD- YOU ME FACE DEPORTATION. IT'S CERTAINLY AN AREA OF GREAT CONCERN AND WE EXPRESS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE FINAL RULE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASED WE WERE- AND ALSO A BIT- YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE I THINK DISAPPOINTED BY THIS THE COURT RULING THAT THAT WE SAW SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. AND SO I THINK AT THIS POINT ARE OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD HAPPEN- IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES AND BE NECESSARILY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY IT ARE ABLE TO SEEK THE SERVICES TO WHICH THEY'RE ENTITLED AND THAT ARE AVAILABLE EXACTLY AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED. DISSEMINATED SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENTS- AS WELL AS WITH HEALTH PLANS INC AND COUNTIES. AND PROVIDER DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS BEING DISSEMINATED SO WE DO HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH WITH THOSE SYSTEMS THOSE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS FOLKS WHO ARE. ADVOCATES OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND DISSEMINATED WIDELY SO THAT. AGAIN WE'RE NOT PREVENTING FOLKS FROM GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND I KNOW THIS IS. DYNAMIC AND IT'S KIND OF IN A CHANGING TARGET BUT I'D APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION YOU MIGHT SHARE WITH US THAT. ILLUSTRATES HOW THAT INFORMATION IS BEING DISSEMINATED STRUGGLING TO DO THAT SO I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR SERMONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. DOCTOR CONNELLY. THIS CAN OF JOB OFFER CENTER MY- THIS WE HAVE A MEDI CAL UPDATE IN IN THE MATERIALS AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME LAST WEEK IN A STATE OF THE STATE REALLY- BROACH THE SUBJECT OF LETTERMAN PETRIE SHORT ACT. AND YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIND FUNDING FOR TREATING. INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS- AND SO WE HAVE THE INSTITUTION FOR MENTAL DISEASES THE I AM D. THAT HAS SORT OF EXCLUDED. A PAYMENTS OF MEDICAID FOR FACILITIES THAT HAVE SIXTEEN OR MORE BEDS- I SAW JUST AT THE END OF MAYBE LAST YEAR JUST RECENTLY THAT. WASHINGTON DC IN THE ADMINISTRATION WE'LL GET A WAIVER TO THE TO THE TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING IN THE SAME REGARD TO TRY AND- A SIMILAR. TO ASSIST IN WATER GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO PURSUE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THIS THIS PROPOSAL OR THIS OPTION IS ONE ELEMENT OF THE KELLY IN SUITE OF PROPOSALS AND WE ARE EXPLORING HOW WE MIGHT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES- HAS ATTACHED TO THAT THAT OPTION TO RECEIVE AND I AM THE WAIVER FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TO GREATLY REDUCE THE LENGTH OF STAY IN AND I AM D. TO AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY DAYS STATEWIDE. TO ACCESS FEDERAL- MATCHING FUNDS FOR THAT LEVEL OF CARE THROUGH MEDICAID AND SO THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR US THOUGH I THINK IT'S A HEALTHY CHALLENGE FORD- BOTH THE US AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO FOR DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO TRY TO MOVE FOLKS WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CARE THAT'S CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE IN THE COMMUNITY. SUCH THAT FOLKS ARE ARE SERVED IN THE MOST INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMMUNITY IM IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE FASHION POSSIBLE- I KNOW THAT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR WHATEVER APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE AVAILABLE- IN OUR OUR COUNTY DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. BUT ALL AND DON'T WANT TO RETURN TO THE DAYS OF WHEN WE JUST ARE LEAN TOO HEAVILY ON HAVE BEEN PEOPLE IN LINE CELEBRITIES ARE INVOLVED IN INVOLUNTARY TREAT ENVIRONMENTS. BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF COMMUNITY- FACILITIES. THERE CERTAINLY IS. BUT I WOULD AGREE HE WON AT AND SO PART THIS EFFORT BY THINK YOU YOU RIGHTLY RAY. THAT A PART OF THIS OF DID. A PROPOSED FOR THE FEDERAL RELATED TO ACCESSING FEDERAL FINANCING FOR MEDICAID FOR I AM DISS ALSO MORE X. EXPENSIVELY DEVELOPING. OUR COMMUITY BASED SYSTEMS OF CARE SUCH THE FOLKS ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT- HOPEFULLY SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN ADDITION TO AFTER CARE. WHEN THERE AND- IN IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. SO ARE WE LOOKING OVER THE WHOLE STRUCTURE FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT OR WE GONNA RELY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU'RE- GONNA GET SOME LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO. DO SOMETHING THAT HS MISERABLY FAILED FOR FIFTY YEARS IN THE STATE. IT IS IT IS A HEAVY LIFT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS BEGUN THIS CONVERSATION THROUGH THE WITH THE WAIVER AND WILL EFFORT IN THE MEDICAL TRANSFORMATION EFFORT. TO TALK THROUGH WHAT THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAT CMS IS SET OUT FOR US TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS APPROVED. AND TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW DO WE BUILD OUT THE CONTINUING I CAN'T JUST BE AN EFFORT TO GAIN MORE FEDERAL FINANCING FOR LOCKED FACILITIES IT HAS TO BE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT. TO BUILD OUT SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT REALLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO MOVE TOWARD RECOVERY AND SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT- IT IS THERE ARE MANY MANY PIECES TO THAT. MANY REQUIREMENTS SET OUT A MINUTE WILL REQUIRE PLANNING AND A LOOK AT AT WORK FORCES WE DISCUSSED EARLIER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING OVER BREEDING ALL THE DIFFERENT- THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT. SO DON'T DON'T HESITATE TO CALL ON ME TO HELP OUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS IT RELATES TO THIS I AM DO YOU EVER. YOU DO HAVE A COUPLE REPUBLICANS LEFT THAT MAYBE. WE CAN YOU KNOW ASSIST IN SOME FORM OR FASHION IT'S A TEAM EFFORT AND WE'RE WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE THAT OFFER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU OF SIR MORE LIKE WEEKLY. I THINK OVER THE- THREE YEARS. I CAN GET A COPY IS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED. ONE RESOLUTION AS AN ASSEMBLY AND ONE IN THE SENATE. ARE REQUESTING- MODIFICATION OF THE I AM THE WAIVER AND ALL ALL MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS A COPY OF THAT BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE WE RECOGNIZE THE- THERE IS A NEED AT SOME POINT FOR SOME TYPES OF FACILITIES. ARE FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED THAT KIND OF CARE. WE SHOULD HAVE A FULL SERVICE OF CONTINUING CARE. AND MANY DIFFERENT- WAYS IF WE WANT. AVOID PEOPLE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY NEED THAT KIND OF- OF HIGH LEVEL CARE. SO WE NEED ALL THE TYPES OF CARE. TO AVOID THE NUMBERS GOING TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF CARE OR- HOMELESSNESS IN ONE YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THAT TOO IS AN OPTION SO CENTERS TO RUBIO HAS SOME QUESTIONS SENATOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO. OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS- MENTAL CLARITY AS AN EDUCATOR I SAW. BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT ESCALATED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS YOU KNOW IN MY AREA WHERE I TODD- SPECIAL LIKE FOOD AND SECURITY HOUSING CRISIS ALL THAT CAUSES A LOT OF ANXIETY AMONG OUR STUDENTS AND- I'M JUST REALLY THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AND DIE I JUST WANNA. YOU KNOW SORT OF ECHO WHAT I THINK MR MONEY IN SAID HERE SOMETIMES- I REPRESENT LIKE THE EAST LA COLLEGE AREA AND WE HAVE PREDOMINANTLY. SPANISH SPEAKERS AND MANY OF THOSE AREAS INCHES BEING MINDFUL OF HAVING CULTURALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCES AND- AND YOU KNOW AREAS IS IMPORTANT- BUT JUST THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO SIT HERE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR I HOPE YOU FOLLOW UP WITHOUT ISSUE I KNOW THAT. ARE TWO SPEAKERS FROM WILL HAVE WERE HERE FROM THE MASTER ON THIS OF CHICKEN THAT'S- DOCTOR GOT LIKE CO- FROM UC DAVIS WHO'S GONNA TALK ABOUT THE- DISPARITIES- RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF SERVICES AND HIS. HIS THAN AT THE MASTER IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY ON THAT SUBJECT HELLO WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN AND WISH YOU THE BEST AND- WILL SERVER THAT THE SENATE. ALL UP ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR INTO THE CONSOLE HERE MICHELLE CRASS CRASS SHE'S THE DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR. AND DIRECTOR OF INNOVATIVE TREATMENT NETWORK AT UCLA ON DEPRESSION. GRAND CHALLENGE OR TALK ABOUT THAT NO WELCOME I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. SO TURN OVER YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. YES SO I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT UCLA HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR YOUNGER POPULATION PARTICULARLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH THE EAST LA COLLEGE AT THE MOMENT SO. A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY- DRAMATICALLY INCREASING PARTICULARLY AMONG EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND THIS INCREASE EXTENDS TO SUICIDE SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS. RUSSIAN AND ANXIETY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OTHER RISKY BEHAVIORS OF COSTS- SUBSTANCE USE BEING ONE OF THE MAIN ONES AND DEPRESSION AD ANXIETY A MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO ACADEMIC UNDER ACHIEVEMENT. SCHOOL DROPOUT AND IMPAIRMENTS WOULD WORK AND AT HOME AND SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. A POOR MENTAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL STRESS LIVE IN A VERY VICIOUS CYCLE OFTEN CULMINATING IN POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. AND SEVERAL OF THESE REASONS DEPRESSION ANXIETY A NOW CONSIDERED THE LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY WORLDWIDE AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZES THAT DEPRESSION. WILL BE THE LEADING CONTRIBUTOR TO GLOBAL DISEASE BURDEN ABOVE AND BEYOND ALL OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. SO WITH FACING AN EPIDEMIC AND THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IS ACTUALLY AMPLIFIED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THAT INCLUDES THE HUNDRED FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SWITCHING ROLE TO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE TYPICALLY MUCH HIGHER IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATION RELATIVE TO FOUR YEAR COLLEGES ONE OF THE ESTIMATES IS THAT ONE HALF. OF STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE AT LEAST ONE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. AND THOSE OF YOU HAVE THE HAND SHOWS HERE THE RATES JUST FOR DEPRESSION. AND DEPRESSION SEVERE DEPRESSION THIS IS VERY DISABLING SEVERE DEPRESSION IS ESTIMATED TO AFFLICT 20% OF STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. COMPARED OF COURSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE ADDITIONAL LIFE CHALLENGES THAT INTERSECT WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT THE RATES OF FOOD IN SECURITY. HOUSING IN SECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS ARE ALREADY AT ASTOUNDINGLY HIGH RATES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATIONS SIR THE TOP HALF SHOWING RATES WHEN THERE IS NO MEDICAL DISABILITY. BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER PRESENT THOSE RATES GO EVEN HIGHER. SUCH THAT OVER ONE IN FOUR OF THE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. AND OVER TWO THIRDS OF FACING HOUSING IN SECURITY. AND YET THEY'RE ATTENDING COLLEGE SO THEY'RE REMARKABLY RESILIENT PEOPLE. SO ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY KIND OF CHAOS. SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT- OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WAS SURVEYED IT APPEARED THAT NINETEEN HAD NO SERVICES WHATSOEVER. AND OF THE REMAINING COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS IT'S VERY HARD TO QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO HAVE BUT HAVING WORKED WITH EAST LA- COLLEGE WHICH SERVES OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. THEY HAVE ONE LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER TO MASSES OF SOCIAL WORK AND TWO INTERNS SERVING THAT POPULATION WITH SOME ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR VETERANS SO OBVIOUSLY UNDER SERVICED. AND OF COURSE THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT STUDENTS WITH VERY HIGH NEEDS AND SUICIDALITY I'M NOT GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF CARE. THAT THIS LACK OF- AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM FROM PREVENTION THROUGH INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT AND THIS LACK OF INTEGRATION WITH ALL OTHER KINDS OF NEEDS THOSE BEING HOUSING FOOD AS WELL. AND ONE THING THAT I'LL MENTION IS THE HEALTHY MINDS NETWORK WHICH IS A LARGE- TEAM FOR MICHIGAN THAT STUDIES THE STATE OF AFFAIRS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. HAS HAS MADE HAS ESTIMATED THAT IF WE WERE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH TO COLLEGE STUDENTS. THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN TERMS OF TUITION REVENUE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER WHO DROP OUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE EXPECTED LIFETIME EARNINGS OF THE STUDENTS. THE SOLAR FAR OUTWEIGH THE COST OF DELIVERING THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. SO YOU SEE LAYS BEING COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION. TO THIS PROBLEM OF- RATES OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS- WE CALL IT THE STAND PROGRAM SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY DEPRESSION. IT DELIVERS SCALABLE GOLD STANDARD EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS THAT A PERSONALIZED TO THE NEEDS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. IT PROACTIVELY IDENTIFIES IN RESPONSE TO URGENT NEEDS SUICIDE HOUSING AND FOOD NEEDS AND IT CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR IS THE PATIENT IN ORDER TO ADAPT THE TREATMENT TO THEIR NEEDS AS THOSE NEEDS EVOLVE OVER TIME. SO IT'S A FULLY ADAPTIVE MODEL. THERE'S A DIAGRAM ON THE NEXT PAGE WHICH ACTUALLY OUTLINES THE PROGRAM I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY WALK YOU THROUGH THE STEPS OF THIS PROGRAM. IT BEGINS WITH A MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER THAT CAN BE ACCESSED AT ANY TIME AT ANY PLACE ON ANY INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICE. BY LINKING TO AN ONLINE ASSESSMENT THAT MEASURES SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY IN MANIA. SO SELF ASSESSMENT USING ADAPTIVE TESTING. THAT SELF ASSESSMENT GIVES IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK TO THE STUDENT OF THEIR CURRENT RANKING SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND PROVIDES IMMEDIATE TRIAGE AND WITHIN MINUTES TWO LEVELS OF CARE. THOSE LEVELS OF CARE- ARE FULL OF THEIR FOUR LEVELS OF CÃM THE FIRST RECORDED TIA IS ZERO TIA MEANS YOU'RE NOT CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING ANY SYMPTOMS BUT YOU MAY ENGAGE IN WHAT TROUBLE. A WAITING WHERE YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO TRACK YOUR SYMPTOMS OVER TIME AND BE ALL FOOD ONLINE EVIDENCE BASED PREVENTION TRAINING PROGRAMS. AT A GUIDED. IF THE STUDENT COMES IN WITH A MILD LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS THEY'RE ALL FOOD EVIDENCE BASED ON LINE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY CERTIFIED AND TRAINED COACHES. THE COACHES ARE OTHER STUDENTS WHO'VE GONE THREE YEAR LONG TRAINING PROGRAM TO COMBINE THE ON LINE THERAPY WITH IN PERSON TOUCH. IF THEY PRESENT WITH MODERATE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OR UP TO SEVERE ANXIETY THEY AGAIN ARE OFFERED ONLINE EVIDENCE BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY BUT WITH MORE ADVANCED COACHES. AND IF THEY PRESENT TO SEVERE SYMPTOMS OR SUICIDALITY OR- MANIC SYMPTOMS THEN THEY ARE ALL FOOD CLINICIAN DELIVER TREATMENT IT'S EITHER DONE IN PERSON OR THROUGH TELEHEALTH DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THE COACHING. CLIENT SO IT TRYING TO COMBINE TELEHEALTH WITH IN PERSON TOUCH. THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY TRACKED SO ONCE THE TRIAGE INTO A LEVEL OF CARE. THEY CONTINUOUSLY REPORT THE SYMPTOMS THROUGH THIS MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER SO THAT WE CAN DO TWO THINGS. FIRST ANY INDICATION OF SUICIDALITY. SENDS A MESSAGE AN AUTOMATED ALERT TO A TWENTY FOUR SEVENTEEN THAT THEN REACHES OUT TO THE STUDENT TO CHECK ON THEIR SAFETY SO IT'S VERY-PROACTIVE OUT REACH. SECOND THIS ONGOING TRACKING ALLOWS US TO ADAPT TO THE TREATMENT SURVEY INITIALLY BEGAN WITH A MILD LEVEL OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND RECEIVING ONLINE THERAPY. THEIR LIFE CONDITIONS CHANGE THEY WORSEN WE MOVED UP TO THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. IF THEY STARTED IN THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE WAS CLINICIANS THE ROOM PROVED THEY'VE MOVED DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVEL OF CARE BECAUSE MAINTENANCE IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO PREVENTION OF RELAPSE. SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT PAGE THAT SIMPLY LISTS HOW THE SYSTEM IS INNOVATIVE. IN THE WAYS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED IT'S AN FULLY INTEGRATED ADAPTIVE SYSTEM OF CARE AND I WOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON THAT. ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU WILL SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE AT UCLA THIS IS UP TO A FEW MONTHS AGO WE'VE OFFERED THIS SCREENING AT UCLA. TWO FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. A PERSON CLOSE TO SEVEN THOUSAND HAVE OPTED IN TO TAKE THE SCREENING THAT'S THAT MENTAL HEALTH TRACKER. WITH ALL FOR TREATMENT TO OVER THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. WE'VE RESPONDED TO OVER A THOUSAND ALERTS FOR SUICIDALITY AND VERY VERY SEVERE DEPRESSION AND WITH TRAINED OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS TO BE COACHES AS IN PS SUPPORT MECHANISMS. WHERE WE'RE GOING NOW ON THE NEXT PAGE IS WE A- DEVELOPING A PILOT PROGRAM. TO COST TO MINES WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE STAND PROGRAM AT UCLA AND MOVED INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THE NEED IS SO GREAT FIVE GRACIA THAN EIGHT UCLA. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE. FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS SO THAT WE CAN ADAPT- PROGRAM TO FIT THE NEEDS OF THIS STUDENTS. WELL WORKING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT IS JUNE FIFTH AS THE DEAN OF STUDENT AFFAIRS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE A STUDENT ADVISORY BODY- TO SUPPORTING AND ADVISING US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTENT IS RELEVANT TO THEM IT'S CULTURALLY SENSITIVE. AND IT COMBINES THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WITHIN NEEDS FOR HOUSING AND FOOD SECURITY. AND AB TIME LINE IS THAT WE WILL BE BETA TESTING A PROGRAM THIS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL BE TESTING THE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM AT THE LACK OF THE SAMA WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN A PILOT STUDY WAS SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS STARTING IN THE FALL AND I SHOULD SAY THIS IS BEING DONE IN COLLABORATION. WITH THE LOS ANGELESCOUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEN FINALLY. A VISION AND WHAT WE HAVE- PROPOSED IS TO EXPAND THIS BEYOND THE LACK. BUT STATEWIDE. AND SO WORKING WITH UCSF SO UCLA AND UCSF WORKING TOGETHER AT THE AS THE HOBBS SO TO SPEAK. TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM OUT TO STARTING WITH TEN COLLEGES FIVE FOUR WHICH UCSF IS RESPONSIBLE FIVE WITH FOR WHICH YOU SEE LAYS RESPONSIBLE. INCLUDING COLLEGES IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE NEED IS EVEN GREATER SO THAT WE CAN- EXPAND WHAT WE DOING TO THOSE MOST IN NEED AND- EVENTUALLY HOPE TO EXPAND THIS TO EVEN MORE COLLEGES STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS WAS- IS YOUR APPROACH FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A DIFFERENT DAY IN THE UC AND WHAT OUR WATER THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCES THE TEMPLATE THIS THE STRUCTURE THE FORMAT THE TEMPLATE IS THE SAME IT'S SO IT'S AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHAT DID FOR THIS IS PRIMARILY THE CONTENT TO BE RELEVANT THEY NEED SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTENT TO THE ON THERAPY IS RELEVANT TO VETERANS THAT COMPRISE SOME THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- TO- THE LATINO OR LATINA STUDENTS TO SINGLE MOTHERS TO VARIOUS SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ENVIRONMENT TO A MOST VULNERABLE TO A DEPRESSION ANXIETY. AND THAT'S WHERE THE ADVISORY GROUPS FROM THE STREET FROM THE STUDENTS AT EACH OF THESE COLLEGE AT THE LACK HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL THE SECOND DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE'RE CREATING IN A SINGLE PORTAL WITH STUDENTS CAN LOG ON TO NOT ONLY ASSESS THEIR MENTAL HEALTH BUT THE CURRENT WELL BEING AND SAFETY SO THE PORSCHE WILL ASSESS TO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO STAY TONIGHT YEAH YOU NEED FOOD- AND- MOVING OUT TO GET THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. OKAY OF HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR WE HAVE TALKED WITH US THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE YOU I SEE YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING THE- TO CAMPUSES. OF AROUND THE STATUS IN AN TRYING TO LOOK AT. THE PRODUCTIVITY OF DOING THAT CORRECT CORRECT YEAH THAT'S THE NEXT STEP YES OKAY THE QUESTIONS PLEASE SIR WELLS WHO GETS TO GO FIRST THIS ONE OKAY LET'S LET'S SURMOUNTING OFFERS ANSWER. YES OKAY YOUR AFTER HIM. YEAH THANK YOU JUST REAL QUICKLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY- SO I GOT SCREENING AND TREATMENT WHAT'S THE REST OF THE ACRONYM OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS A SUMMARY IT ACTUALLY ALSO WORKS THE PROGRAM COVERS SLEEP IT COVERS TRAUMA AND WE'RE MOVING TO ALSO COVER SUBSTANCE USE ME. IN THIS. INTERACTIVE TOOL ON ANY STUDENT CAN ACCESS IT. YOU MENTIONED HIP A PROTECTIONS BUT IS THERE ANY. DANGER OF OVERLAP OF A STUDENT ACCESSING THIS- BUT RAISING CONCERNS OF HOUSING OR OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL ACCESS DOES ANY OF THIS IS THERE A DANGER IN THE THIS FILTERING INTO A STUDENTS- ACADEMIC RECORD IN. ADDING TO STIGMA FOR PURSUING THIS SUPPORT A GOOD QUESTION THE WAY WE'VE DESIGNED INTO UCLA AND AS WE IMPLEMENTED A LACK WITH THE RETAINING CONFIDENTIALITY OF ALL THE INFORMATION SO THAT IT DOESN'T SLIP OVER INTO THEIR ACADEMIC RECORD. BUT STUDENTS ALSO GIVE US CONSENT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR ACADEMIC RECORD BECAUSE ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM IS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SO IT IT WE GET THE INFORMATION TO ADD TO OUR DATABASE THE DATA DOES NOT GO OVER INTO THEIR I CAN IS THERE ANY RECORD THAT YOU SAW THAT INFORMATION IF THEY SIGN THE- RELEASE. IN IT TO SEC THEN IN THERE ACADEMIC THAT YOU MADE THE REQUEST BUT NOT. THAT WOULD THAT THE CONSENT FORM YES I DO NOT BELIEVE SO I CAN DOUBLE CHECK THAT BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE SO. IN ANSWER THE PILOT PROGRAM IN EAST LA WITH PLANS TO TRY TO EXPAND ITS TO TEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES YES. WHAT'S THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT. SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUNDING WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE EXPANSION WE HAVE BUILT A PROPOSAL OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN UCLA AND UCSF UCSF IS DEFINITELY ON BOARD TO DO THIS BUT WHEN SEEKING FUNDING AND LOOKING AT VARIOUS SOURCES. TO TRY TO GET THAT FUNDING ANY LOOKING IT SOURCES OTHER THAN THE STATE BUDGET FOUNDATIONS FUND PHILANTHROPIC WE'RE LOOKING AT PHILANTHROPIC WE'RE LOOKING AT- NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF MENTAL HEALTH AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE STATE. ONE THANK YOU I MEAN NEAR YOUR OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS GLOBALLY. IT NEEDS TO BE RAISED ARE. HELLO ORDER YOUR HERE TODAY HELPING EDUCATE US ANY OTHER- PUBLIC EDUCATION OR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG OTHER POLICY MAYOR OTHER POLICY MAKERS AROUND THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY. HOW WE DOING ANYMORE THAT YES THE WESTS CERTAINLY REACHING OUT TO WITH BEING- VISITING VARIOUS- POLICY GROUPS AN TALKING WITH DIFFERENT ALLIANCES ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WHICH IS TO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF THE- THE REAL EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE YOUNGER POPULATION- THE WORK FORCE OF THE FUTURE I MEAN YOU SHARE THE CHEN I THINK IT WAS AGAIN. HE'S STILL A WITH THIRTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS IN FIVE- SOME FIVE PROFESSIONAL YES TWO OF THOSE INTERNS RATE SO. IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD BE. APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING TO REALLY- BUT BY THE SUPPORT THAT STUDENTS MIGHT NEED. TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THERE WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH COMMISSIONS TO ADDRESS THE NEED. AND SO WHILE THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PLACE TO CONDITIONS THAT'S WHY NOW MODEL CLINICIANS ARE RESERVED FOR THE ONE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS MOST SEVERE REALLY IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO GIVE AN ONLINE THERAPY PROGRAM. BUT MILD TO MODERATELY DISTRESSED INDIVIDUALS WILL RECEIVE IF THEY DO THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHERE THE COACHING COMES IN WE'LL GET AS MUCH BENEFIT FROM THAT AS THEY WOULD FOR MANY IN PERSON THERAPY VISIT. AND IT PREVENTS THE ESCALATION UP TO THE HIGHER LEVELS SO WE SEE THESE THINGS IS WORKING TOGETHER WE NEED MORE UNDER CONDITIONS. BUT THAT'S RIGHT. MORE QUESTIONS AND USING TECHNOLOGY AND TOGETHER REDUCING THE BURDEN ON THE ON THE COMMISSION YEAH SO IT MAY BE TOO EARLY BUT DO YOU ARE YOU COLLECTING DATA DO YOU HAVE ANY DAA TO SHOW. YOU SHARED SOME NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO. THOSE THAT HAVE GONE TO A MORE SEVERE CATEGORY BUT- ANY METRICS OF HOW THAT EARLY INTERVENTION HAS KEPT PEOPLE THOUGH NOT MANAGEABLE LEVEL YEP SO OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT I SHOULD PUT IN A FLOOD OF OUR RESULTS WITH OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THOSE WHO AND WHO ARE IN THE MILDER LEVELS INTO THE ONLINE THERAPY. THE SYMPTOMS REDUCE ON AVERAGE DOWN TO A NORMAL TO MILD LEVEL- AND THOSE WHO COMING TO US VIA- CATEGORY AT FIRST RESPOND VERY POSITIVELY TO THE TREATMENT SO WE'RE GETTING VERY GOOD RESULTS WE DON'T HAVE. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH THIS. BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY OUR GOAL IS TO SEE THROUGH COMPARING STUDENTS WHO ENROLL WITH US TO STUDENTS WHO DON'T IN ROLE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM OVER TIME THREE WELL THANK YOU THINK THAT DATA WOULD BE OF INTEREST AS WELL AN INMATE. BULLS EFFORTS TO MORE FOR. TO EXPAND THE- THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. HELLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I THINK I HAD ALREADY READ THIS REPORT AND- A FEW MONTHS BACK I BELIEVE- AND I HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN EAST LA COLLEGE AND- WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO. JUST HIGHLIGHT AND THINK THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AROUND EAST LA COLLEGE BECAUSE IF REALLY STEPPED UP. THEY FOUND A REALLY HUNGER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING IT IS. IT'S A CRISIS AND DOES SOME OF THE BUSINESSES AROUND THERE HAVE. STARTED TO OFFER VOUCHERS FOR STUDENTS TO COME IN AND HAVE A MEAL- MANY REPORTED HAVING. ONE MEAL A DAY AND THAT IS. VERY MINIMAL AND SO SOME OF THE BUSINESSES STARTED SAYING THAT IF THEY CAME IN WITH A VOUCHER FROM THE SCHOOL THEY WOULD FEET I'M IN AND NOT TELL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GETTING BY. I'M HOPING TO EVENTUALLY EXPLORE THIS HOW WE CAN DO THIS ACROSS THE STATE WHERE. MAYBE OFFERING TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES A PARTICIPAR AROUND COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT BUT THAT WAS THE LEADING CAUSE OF THE STRESS AND ANXIETY FROM THE STUDENTS THAT I SPOKE TO- NOT HAPPY MEALS AND- NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP IN. AND SO THIS IS VERY PROMISING TO ME- AND I HAD THE SAME QUESTION I BELIEVE- THAT THE CHAIR ASSN IN REGARDS TO THE DIFFERENT. APPROACH FROM EAST EAST LA TO UCLA IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF. THE COMMUNITY WE'RE DEALING WITH IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF. THE COMMUNITIES IN THAT AREA. ARE NOT VERY- WILLING TO EXPRESS THEY HAVE INSIDE EITHER NOT WILLING TO COME OUT AND SAY. THEIR FOR THEIR SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN. STIGMATIZED FOR A LONG TIME AS MISTER MONEY MENTION IT'S REALLY. DELICATE TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION DOESN'T LEAK OUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALREADY DEALING WITH. THAT THE INSECURITY OF FOOD AND HOUSING AND NOW HAVING TO BE LABELED- YOU KNOW. IT AN ARC. I REMEMBER I WENT TO EAST LA COLLEGE IT WAS SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT. AND DOES BUT SHOULD BE LABELED LIKE EITHER MENTALLY DISTURBED OR CHALLENGE I MEAN THAT CARRIED WAIT AROUND TO SOME OF OUR- COMMUNITY MEMBERS SELL. SUFFERS ABOUT THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING A IT'S REALLY PROMISE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN. READING ON THIS AND- JUST. BEING REALLY SENSITIVE ABOUT THE APPROACH AND I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER THAT YOU'RE- A VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW YOU PULL APPROACH LATINOS AND LATINAS IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. BUT YOU KNOW I WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU OFF LINE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. FIGURE THIS OUT BUT AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO THANK THOSE. BUSINESS HIS AROUND EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE WHO HAVE. UP AN OFFER OUT. BUT STUDENT COMES IN WITH THAT NO FROM THE SCHOOL AND THEY- FREE. AND SO THAT'S AND- TO ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO EAT AND AT LEAST HAVE WARM MEAL A COUPLE OF DAYS. I MEAN START COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR. OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING ON A SUCH WONDERFUL VERY. GOOD GREAT STORY OF THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMING TOGETHER ON A- IT'S BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH- ELECTIVES RELIGION REALLY INSPIRING AND SIR MORE ART THANK YOU MEASURE THANK YOU DOCTOR I AM CURIOUS HOW MANY PSYCHIATRIST. DOES UCLA PRODUCE EVERY YEAR. WELL THAT IS THE QUESTION I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I DON'T KNOW OF. PSYCHIATRISTS I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT RESTAURANTS ARE WAS I WAS HOPING IT SAID LIKE THIRTY UCI'S PRODUCING ABOUT NINE YEARS I'M THINKING. THAT WAY HAS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE POPULATION OF ORANGE COUNTY. INSIDE PSYCHOLOGY WE PRODUCE ABOUT. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AM OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS- BUT PSYCHIATRY BECAUSE I MAINLY SITUATION THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE NUMBER. BUT CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH IS THE ISSUE AND AS I SAID BEFORE THIS. WE NEED MORE COMMISSIONS WE NEED TO BUILD UP THE WORK FORCE BUT WE CAN'T I DO THINK ASSUME THAT THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT IT'LL NEVER BE SUFFICIENT WHEN YOU THINK AT. AT UCLA WHICH ALREADY HAS IN A VERY GOOD AND SERVICES WE STILL NEED TO DO THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THE SERVICES ARE OVERWHELMED. WITH DEMAND ON HEALTH. I LOVE YOUR LOS ANGELES ACCENT. THE TRICK A STRELA. I'M CURIOUS WHEN A STUDENT GOES ONLINE TO DO THE SCREENING AND TREATMENT. WHAT WHAT'S THE DROPOUT RATE MONTH SAYS HE THE CONSENT FORM AND YES ALL THE REST OF YOU KNOW THEY COULD CALL ME YOU KNOW I. WOULD THINK THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE INTIMIDATING THERE IS A HIGH DROPOUT RATE- SALUTE THE IT'S INTERESTING THE THIS THE THERE'S A DROP OUT FROM THE POINT TO. DOING A CONSENT TO DOING THE SCREENING THEN ONCE HAVE DONE THE SCREENING THERE'S A DROP OUT FROM THERE TO THE TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT. MORE WITH THE DIGITAL ONLINE THERAPY THAN WITH THE ACTUAL IN PERSON THERAPY- AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH- OF. WE ARE VERY SIT TENSE TO EDUCATION AROUND THE VALUE OF THE ON LINE THERAPY PROGRAM- WHEN IF PEOPLE STAY WITH THE PROGRAM THEY DO VERY WELL AS I SAID BEFORE. BUT THAT'S TRUE THAT DROP OUT IS CHARACTERISTIC EVERYWHERE. EVEN IN COMMUNITY CLINICS WHERE YOU HAVE IN PERSON THERAPY THE AVERAGE NUMBER SESSIONS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET IS ONE. ONE SESSION. SO IT'S A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE AND- OCEANS THANK YOU RICHARD YOU SHOW YOUR TIME AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK. OKAY WE'RE- DOWN TO OUR NEXT PANEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PEOPLE COME UP WE'RE GONNA HAVE- SERGIO DOCTOR SERGIO ANGRY ARE ON DECK SO YOU'LL GET X. YOLO. SORRY SEARCH SHOWS FROM USE UC DAVIS AND- AS I SURGERY EARLIER- CENTER FOR REDUCING ELSE DISPARITIES AND PROFESSOR. OF CLINICAL INTERNAL MEDICINE CHRISTINE SMITH IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. SERVE THE DIST SURGEONS GOING TALK ABOUT DISPARITIES IN THAT SUBJECT CHRISTINE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT THE YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS- OF PATHWAYS TO THE RING CULTURALLY RELEVANT TREATMENT. TWO IMPACTED USE AND OUR BROTHER BE WELL PROGRAM SO. I GUESS SURGERY YOUR FIRST DAY WELL THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATE PERSON THANK YOU BYE ANYA FOR THESE CAN BE PATIENT THROUGH CHAIR SWAMP THOUGHTS ABOUT. A TOPIC THAT I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. IN WHEN I HOPING TO BLOOM. I KNOW THAT WE ARE CHORE ON TIME HE IS- WHY MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS. TO HIGHLIGHT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE AND UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. AND FINALLY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOLUTIONS TO THOSE DISPARITIES. IN I'LL TRY TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS CHALLENGING WHICH TO SUMMARIZING ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF RESEARCH ON YP MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS. A IN JUST OVER A THREE FOUR MINUTES A BUT BUT I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT ABOUT RELEVANCE IN MAGNITUDE OF MENTAL DISORDERS. WELL A I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A SLIGHT DAY SO- PLEASE. A BEAR WITH ME ABOUT THAT. THERE ARE SIX THAT I WANT TO ABOUT THE MENTAL DISORDERS THE FIRST ONE IS THAT ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT CLASSES OF CRIME BCC CHRONIC DISEASES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION HOW FREQUENT ARE OUR DAY. WELL THE CHANNEL FOR DECADES NOW OF THE FREQUENCY OF MENTAL DISORDERS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IF WE CONSIDER LIFETIME. PREVALENCE LIFETIME PREVALENCE IS ABOUT 50% OF THE POPULATION. IF WE CONSIDER TWELVE MONTHS. ONE ZERO FOUR FOUR ONE OUT OF FIVE DEPENDING ON WHO WE ARE TALKING ^UT. ARE SUFFERING CURRENTLY OF ONE OR MORE MENTAL ILLNESSES SO VERY FREQUENT SECOND IS THAT BIG CALL CURT. WITH THE CHARTER SERVE SOMEONE SUFFERS FROM DEPRESSION HE'S VERY LIKELY. THE WILL SUFFER FROM MY THE OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR DIABETES OR OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS. SO THIS IS THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL CALL MORE THESE. THIRD IS THAT TYPICALLY HAVE MUCH EARLIER AGES SELF CONCEPT NINE BOULDER CHRONIC DISEASES. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW- AP PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT BUT BASS THIRD VERY EARLY IN LIFE. A TO THE POINT THAT THE CALL YOU OF MIND WHO HAS SPUR THE USE THIS NATIONAL SURVEYS THAT THE WRONG CANCER FROM HARPER HIGH SCHOOL THEN THE CRONY CONDITIONS OF THE U. YOU KNOW BERRY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. HEY 50% OF MENTAL DISORDERS ARE MANIFESTED BY AGE FOURTEEN AND BY AGE BIT MORE INFORMATION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS AND SHARE WITH YOU AT IN IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES. A THE ONLY THING IS. THAT MENTAL DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST DISABLING AWFUL CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. DOCTOR CRASKE ALREADY PER SHARE WITH US. SOME OF THE- FREQUENCY I MEAN THE IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE STABILITY LEASE. BABETTE BEATTY'S EXCUSE ME DEPRESSION PRODUCES. BUT IF WE CONSIDER. THE FALL PAIN COURSES SO BE SEVERELY. INTERNATIONALLY CERTAINLY HERE IN THE US FIVE OR THE OZARK MENTAL DISORDERS NUMBER ONE. THE CRASH. BUT THE YOU KNOW THAT OUR- OLDER SUBSTANCE ABUSE IT'S CENTER. IN BEING BE. ALSO A SOURCE. WITH SIGNAL AT BIRTH SO SIDE COSTS IN I'LL JUST MENTION BRIEFLY SOMETHING RELATED TO THAT THEY ARE VERY COSTLY NOT ONLY ON ABSENTEEISM NO PEOPLE CONTROL TO WORK- AT BECHTEL SUPPRESSION V. SOME PEOPLE COME TO WORK BUT BE ARE ON THE MOON. IN ALL THEY ARE NOT REALLY PRESSING A TO DO THAT WORK WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE FAR YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN IN OCCUPATIONS. THAT THE REQUIRED A LOT OF CONCENTRATION. FINALLY IN CITY'S THE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU THESE ONLY A MINORITY WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS RECEIVE TREATMENT. IN THE PRECEDING YEAR. MORE TO COME ABOUT THAT. OTHER THINGS THAT I WANT TO MENTION ABOUT MENTAL DISORDERS AND NOW YOU'RE READY MENTIONED THAT HOW MAY IN FACT THAT THEY HAVE ON DISABILITY THAT THE 26% OF BUBBLES AND ONLY A BABY ARE DISABLED RELATED TO MENTAL DISORDERS SPECIES BUT A HUGE NUMBER. AND 6% WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC IN SERIOUS CONDITIONS BY PER WEEK COLE SET BEARD AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS. THE OTHER ONE THE THIRD YOU NOTE CURRENT. THAT MENTAL DISORDERS ARE NUMBER ONE LOST WAGES YOU'RE READY MENTION RELATED TO WHAT. NUMBER ONE BECAUSE OF INJURY DATA SPECIFICALLY BY SUICIDE. NUMBER ONE MOST COSTLY BIOMEDICAL PROGRAM AIMED NUMBER ONE MOST AND THEY'RE FUNDED BY YOUR MEDICAL AREAS UNFORTUNATELY EVEN WITH HOW FREQUENT IN BE MADE AT THE BEING BACKED UP MENTAL DISORDERS CáC. UNFORTUNATELY THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE ACTOR THAT CLEAN OF FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH. A MORE GAINES CUT BEEN DONE IN THE AREA MY TO HAS TO BE DONE. THE OTHER THING THAT I WON TO. WELCOME TO. INFO SEES. THE HOW HOW CEASE TO PLAY OUT IN THE GYM POPULATION. NOTE A B. S. A. CANCER FAMILY FOUNDATION A DIVA STUDY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A STATE WIDE AND THEY FOUND THAT MEANT THE HELL WAS THE NUMBER ONE HEALTH CARE PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. AIM BE SAME AS STATEWIDE POLL SHOWED THAT BIT POP HELPED THE SHOW ISSUE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ONE BETTER WARNER IN LEGISLATOR TO ADDRESS HE'S MAKING SURE. THE TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE FOR WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS 88% CALL IT EXTREMELY OR VERY IMPORTANT. YET THE MOST THE MOST CALIFORNIA'S THING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE. ESPECIALLY EVE DATE TRIED TO GET IT NBC'S BORN A GOAL ONCE AGAIN ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOL THE TREATMENT GAP IN IN A MINUTE I'LL. EIGHT EMPHASIZE SOMETHING SOME OF THAT. TWENTY THAT IS IMPORTANT TO GREED ABOUT MENTAL DISORDERS IS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE HERE LEON SAID THAT THEY HAVE. THAT THE- THIS USUALLY FROM THREE TO FOUR YEARS. INTERVAL BETWEEN THE FIRST SYMPTOMS AND A FULL BLOWN PROGRAM WHICH IS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS FIFTIES. SO THE ONSET PASSING MENTION THE MENTAL DISORDERS OF USUALLY OCCURS IN CHILDHOOD OR ADOLESCENCE. IN UNFORTUNATELY THE TREATMENT THE PIGGLY DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL YEARS LATER YOU KNOW WHAT NATION WHY THE ESTIMATE SEES THAT A IT TAKES ABOUT ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN YEARS FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS TO RECEIVE TREATMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THE MEANTIME IT CALLS TO SELL LARA HIGH BOOK T<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;PERSONAL LIVES&lt;/c&gt;</u> AS WELL AS FAMILY LIVES AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS COMMUNITY HE'S REALLY IN TAX. THAT THE BILL MENTAL TRAGIC THIRTIES OVER THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. SCHOOL DEVELOPING A MENTAL DISORDER AT THE VERY END OF THE AGE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS SUCH AS MARRIAGE AND THE MORE THEY BORDERS AND EVEN SOUP SEQUIN DISABLING FIVE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS SOMETHING THAT I YOU ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO YOU SIR AND YOU MENTION YOU SENATE SORT MORNING MENTION ABOUT THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. WELL BASED STRONG THIS PREDICTOR OF AIR LEóN SAID MENTAL ILLNESS IN ALSO A ON SIT BOTH A PHYSICAL CHRONIC CONDITIONS THESE ARE A BURST CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES SO IF A KID EXPERIENCES EARLY AND DIVE ANY KIND OF FIVE USE. EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL SEXUAL. A THREE NEGLECT DOMESTIC BY. BAY A XP A MAN HEALING IN THE FAMILY YOU KNOW WONDER ONE PARENT THAT COMMITTED SUICIDE OR SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS HAVE BUILT A MENTAL ILLNESSES TO SCHIZOPHRENIA DOES COUNT I SAID A IS THAT BETTER SEE A BURST CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. ONE THING THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONCE AGAIN IS THAT THE FULL THE STATE OF THAT I CHAIR WITH YOU WIND UP WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THESE WHAT WE CALL THE TREATMENT GAP. NO IN BODIES THE FACT THAT BETWEEN 95290% OF PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDERS. HAVE NOT RECEIVE UP BROKE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. SAM BETTER TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS DISPARITIES HERE ON HOW THIS HAPPENS FOR EXAMPLE A EVEN GOAL I GROWING PERCENTAGE OF CONVALESCENCE REPORTED EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION INCREASING YEARS AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE ONE OF THE SLIDES. THAT THAT'S WHERE THE SEIZE REPORTED HAVING A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN THE PAST YEAR. A. N. BADDIES SO THE BAD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE TRAIN HIGHS BE COMPARED TO THE NATION THE TREND HAS BEEN THAT OF A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODES EPISODES ARE OP WORK. K. ANY SPITE OF THAT- LISTENING ONE REPORTED PRESS TREATMENT WHICH IS IN THE NAY LIFE. A LET ME CHAIR WOULD YOU A BIGGER PICTURE AND THIS IS MADE UP AT CAMP FROM SAM'S SO. A BAD PC'S PASSED YOUR DEPRESSION TREATMENT AMONG ADOLESCENTS AGE TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN. IN YOU IF YOU LOOK AT TE SLIDE- OVER 70% DEEP NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT. EIGHTEEN IN THE IN WOMEN A ABOUT 60% IN IN THE WHITE POPULATION IT NEARLY LATINOS THOSE PERCENTAGES OF THE TREATING THAT ARE EVEN HIGHER. YOU KNOW A IN THIS IS THIS BY THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE B. C.'S BURTON BED THIS TREATMENT GAPS- CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS THAT AREJUST THESE MATING IS THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ABOUT THE UMBILICAL. GAME AIN'T BUT THEY'RE OLDER. OLDER MENTAL ILLNESSES A BAD- I'M NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT WINDOW TREATMENT EAST NEED. WHY IS THIS TREATMENT GAP WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT THEY BETTER FROM A BEING THE BEETLE LABEL FOR EXAMPLE SPEAK MY ALREADY WISEMAN CHIN AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO. TALK ABOUT BECAUSE CHANGE OF CAR BEING A MENTAL ILLNESS YOU KNOW A- A HE IS A MAJOR BARRIER FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK SERVICES THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF A STATEMENT IN THE SURGEON GENERAL AT THE NATIONAL AGO A RECOGNIZE THAT IMPORTED IN REPORTS A COUPLE OF REPORTS THAT BABY BABY RELEASED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL- A IN A YOU SENT UP FOR- AND MENTION A ABOUT THE LACK OF CULTURAL LINGUISTICALLY. APPROPRIATE SERVICES. THESE CAN BE AN EXAM WHAT BAY A BECOME LEVEL AT THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL THEY LACK OF SO IN THE RESOURCE. IMPORT LIVING CONDITIONS IN THERE WE SOBRE OVERALL A LACK OF ENGAGEMENT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE ALL SORTS OF IDEAS AS TO WHY THEY ARE NOT A YOU KNOW ACCESSING ACCESSING CARE. A I WILL. I WILL GO THROUGH SOME OF THE SLIGHTS BERRY WEEKLY BECAUSE OF TIME- BUT- IN TERMS OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE ARE SEVERAL SOLUTIONS THAT I WILL DISCUSS WITH YOU BRIEFLY ONE OF THEM IS SOMETHING THAT. OUR CENTER FOR RELEASING KELLY SPIRIT THESE HE'S DOING IN SOLANO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IN WITH- MADE SEVERAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IN AND YOU KNOW SOLANO COUNTY- HE SAID A RULE- IS HAVE YOU BEEN TO RURAL- COMMUNITY. IN NBC SO THE EIGHTY EIGHT THE PROJECT FUNDED BY THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION UNDER DATE INNOVATIONS PROJECT- THIS IS A MULTI YEAR PROJECT- I INCLUDED IN THAT A IN THIS LIGHT BACK SOME DETAILS THAT I WON WILL THROUGH- YOU CAN GO. THROUGH THEM- YOURSELF BUT THE BIG GOALS OF THIS PROJECT WHERE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND UTILIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THREE HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED POPULATIONS IN SOLANO COUNTY. AND THOSE ARE LET THINGS PHILIPPINES AND LGBT Q. CAN ALSO TO INCREASE WORKFORCE THEY BURIED BY THEIR CITY. AND TO HELP THE COMPANY THE BILL OF POLICIES PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE ARE APPEALING TO THOSE. POPULATIONS. PHONE I AM VERY SAY A SLIGHT ON WHY HE SAID THAT WE HAVE ON IOWA GO THROUGH WITH BUT WHAT I WILL TO IN THE THAT BIG WHEN THEY TO OUR TO SEE IF WE COULD CALL DAY PROVIDE DISPARITY SEEN LIKE BEING LISTEN BEING A SET THAT TIME THAT WORKS HISTORICALLY THIS. I'M VERY HAPPY TO READ. THE BASED ON. REPORT THAT CAN OUT OF THE CAR HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION A FEW- YOU KNOW ONLY ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH SPECIFICALLY. THAT THE FROM NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEANT TO HELP ACCESSING SOLANO COUNTY INCREASE. 49% FOR LATINOS IN 12% FOR PHILIPPINES SO SOMETHING WE A WHOLE WE ARE. AT LEAST PRELIMINARILY I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE. BUT IT TAKES A LAURA FORCE AND COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION IN ORDER TO DO THAT. ALL THEIR SOLUTIONS THAT I WON TO INFO. OUR IS THE MEMORY EFFORTS AND THAT INCLUDES FOR A ALL THE AUDIO VISUAL TOOLS AND SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. TO COMBAT A STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS BUT SOME OF THESE HAS BEEN. DONE THROUGH THE MHA STATEMENT TO SAY RESOURCES BY THE WAY ALSO EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT APPROACHES. AND COMMUNITY THE FIND EVIDENCE AND THIS BRINGS ME TO A MAJOR INITIATIVE THAT HE'S- FOCUSING ON THEIR BY VERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITY PROJECT. A SIXTY MILLION- INVESTMENT THAT IS UNDER WAY IN WHICH THAT ARE THIRTY FIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED TO PASS.A PROMISING PRACTICES TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE COLLECTIVELY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY IN THE START WITH VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. AND FINALLY A PERSON CENTER CULTURAL LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT RICKOVER ORIENT THAT TRAUMA INFORMED. CARE WHICH IS VERY VERY CRITICAL TO THE- LAST. THING THAT I WANT TO MENTION TALKING ABOUT THE TRAINS HE'S THE SUICIDE RATES. THAT ARE YOU KNOW. A CHEST ALARMED ME. THERE HAS BEEN THE CITY'S EVERY THAT SWEET SO RATES IN ALMOST EVERY pSTATE I'D BE FOR LEVEL BUT FIVE FORTY NINE OF THE STATE'S HIGH SPEED A SCENE- INCREASES CAN I INCLUDED A SLIGHT OF BETA THE BETA BUT LESS PROVIDED BY SCIENCE HE'S THE MOST RECENT DATA BUT IF YOU TAKE IT THE PERCENT CHANGE IN SUICIDE RATES BY DEMOGRAPHICS IN GEOGRAPHY WHAT YOU GET. IS THAT THE A BIT TREND IS THAT THE ETHNIC GROUP THAT IS KIND OF IN THE HIGHEST RATES FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ARE LATINOS I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT ACTUALLY I TOLD THAT THERE WERE GONNA BE OLDER OLDER GROUPS BUT THE EYES OPEN HERE BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT OF FULL THE AGE GROUPS THAT ARE INCLUDED HERE. BIG GROUP WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SCIENCE THROUGH FIVE SUICIDE RATES ARE A EIGHTY EIGHT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ZERO TWO SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE EIGHTY SUCH TRAGEDY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING COLLECTIVELY TO CIRCUMVENT THAT PROGRAM IN SAME THING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF SERIOUS THOUGHTS AT THOSE WHO MADE A PLAN IN THOSE WHO ATTEMPTED STREETS THREE SITES. IN IN YOUNG PEOPLE. IN THIS IS CAP ABSOLUTELY HERE IN CAN YOU. AS WELL CHEST TO GIVE YOU A SAY. A MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED. DIED SWISS IN TWO AND SEVEN. I FEEL 2% INCREASE FOR TO PASS. AND EIGHTEEN IN ONE AND THE PROBLEM I WEST PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR THE YOUNG SOUL SUICIDES AMONG ADOLESCENTS AGE 15219% IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED BY SIXTY THREE PERCENT. SO WITH THAT A I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE TOTALITY OF WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS. TO AND REALLY A LOOKING TO THEIR DIRECT YOU SEEN THE THREATENING GOT PORTING PROVING THAT THREE AND GOT. AND THE BEST WAY TO ACCORDING TO- YOU KNOW I SENATOR ACTUALLY MET AT A YEAR SEVERAL BY WILLIAM. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BEING KEPT AFFAIRS HE WAS SAYING THE BEST WAY TO ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES EAST THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN CARE WE'VE BEEN DEEPER. TO EACH PATIENT. WHICH WITH COFFEE BATES I HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ENCOURAGES PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE CARE BECAUSE WHAT WE USUALLY DO BY MY PHYSICIAN YOU KNOW I'M A PROVIDER I HAVE BEEN A PROVIDER HE SAID. BUT WE DON'T. GREAT THE PATIENCE INTO THEIR OWN TREATMENT IN THE SOME THAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING MUCH MORE OFTEN SOMEONE STOP. YOUR CHRISTINE. FOR MENTAL HEALTH. WILL OPEN UP FOR QUICK BECAUSE- THANK YOU SOME. TO CHEER THANK YOU ALSO SENATORS FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE'VE BEEN WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO WITH PERMANENTE. ON SERIES THAT WE TOOK AROUND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CALLED THE YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THAT TODAY AND IT'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SYSTEM IMPACTING YOUTH SPECIFICALLY THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND- YOU FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM- TO COME TOGETHER IN A PRIVATE PROCURED MANNER- LIMITED SPACE IN EACH OF THE SESSIONS- THROUGH. SACRAMENTO OAKLAND AND FRESNO WE HAD A SEPARATE ON ADVERTISE SESSION IN OAKLAND I WILL TALK ABOUT JUST A MOMENT- IT'S REALLY A FORM FOR THEM TO TELL THEIR SIDE REALLY WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE SYSTEM. IN  OF SWEEPING EFFORT TO- MITIGATE TRAUMA TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA ASUS AND THE THINGS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH ON A DAILY BASIS- IS REALLY- HAD IN A LON IMPACT ON THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE WORKING ON A FINAL REPORT WHICH WILL SHARE WITH YOU SHORTLY- BUT WE- TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PUTTING THE SESSIONS TOGETHER IT'S IT WASN'T IT LOCAL LISTENING SESSION IT WAS REALLY- TAILORED TO THE CULTURAL LANGUAGE OF THE YOUTH. AND WE- ARE TO USE WE HAD I A GOING ON WE TALKED ABOUT INNOVATION. ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT CURRENTLY YOU IS THAT THE CLIPS TO INTEGRATES EDGY FOR HEATING TRAUMA. AND WE HAD A PANEL OF EXPERTS SAID EACH EVEN FOR YOU ADVOCATES WHO- HAD CYST INVOLVED. SOME RETAIL STORY THE- OUR ABOUT THEIR- THAT WAS LED BY A CALL WHO WAS WITH THE ON THE IN TWO WAR AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER COME THAT AS SPOKEN MORE THAT JUST CHANGED THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM- THE PERSON THAT WAS ON OUR TOUR WITH US HAD- TRAUMA IN HIS BACKGROUND ALSO HE HAD A BACKGROUND WHERE HE'D BEEN SHOT HE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE IN HIS COMMUNITY IN FACT THE OF VALLEY HIGH COMMUNITY RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO- BUT THE ABILITY TO. RESONATE WITH THE YOUTH AND GET THEM TO OPEN UP WAS- REALLY IMMENSE SO- WE ALL TOOK THAT TO ANOTHER LEVEL LATER ON IN THE SESSIONS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN ARTIST- TO EACH ONE SO E DID EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION THROUGH ART- THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT ARTISTS THAT EACH OF THE SESSIONS AND WE ALSO HAD OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS HAD SOME OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT TRAUMA AND ASUS AND THEN WE USED A SURVEY WE DID DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEYS WE- SERVICE ABOUT A SPECIFIC TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES THAT WERE REALLY REVEALING- WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SAFETY IN THE SYSTEM AND ASK THEM. DIRECTLY DO YOU FEEL SAFE IN THE SYSTEM AND IF YOU GRADUATED FROM A SYSTEM DO YOU FEEL SAFE NOW WHERE YOU ARE- SOME DID AND SOME QUICK LEAD DID NOT SO- THE YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS- WAS A PATHWAY TO GREATER CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE EXORCIST. IT'S A THEY'RE NOT UNITY TO RE COMMUNITY DOLLARS I AM ALWAYS BEEN THE CAN BE BET DAHLE. AND LOOK AT IN IN WAY TO GET THE MORE RELEVANT SERVICE TO THE U. AFTER THE CHANCE THAT THEY ALL IN WHICH MEANS FLIGHT PATH. A V. R. IN E. GAIN BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SPACE ALL BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT TO THEIR A- THROUGH SCHOOL PARTNER. WHICH KAISER HOW KERN AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE THIS IS ONE THE REASON WE WANTED TO LISTEN BUT THE NATIONAL OFFICE AND THE REGIONAL OFFICES AND ALSO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BIT OFFICES OF KAISER. ALL HAVE A TREMENDOUS- FOCUS ON ACES IN TRAUMA AND THE DOLLARS TO BACK IT UP SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME NEW PROGRAMS- NEW ARE PEAS NEW. PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND REIMAGINING SOME. OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND. THE SESSION THAT WE HELD WAS WOULD ONLY WITH VIOLENCE IMPACTED YOU IN OAKLAND- THESE WERE RIVAL. RIVALS IN THE ROOM AND THEY WERE THIRTY OF THEM THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT MALES AND TWO FEMALES- ALL VIOLENCE IMPACTED YOUTH. THAT SESSION WASN'T ADVERTISE WE HAD A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND OFFICE OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION TO DO THIS WORK. AND WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM YOU COULDN'T TELL THAT THERE WAS ANY RIVALRY OR ANY OF THAT GOING ON- THEY WERE ATTENTIVE OF QUIET- ENGAGED- AND WHEN YOU BRING IN A CULTURAL BROKER LIKE THE- THE SPOKEN WORD ARTIST WHO HAD A SIMILAR BACKGROUND BUT IT CHANGED HIS LIFE AROUND THERE WAS. A LOT OF CAMARADERIE IN THE ROOM AND THAT BY THE TIME WE FINISHED- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT- CULTURAL ISSUES THE PRESSURE THAT MALES HAVE ON THEM TO YOU KNOW NOT SHOW EMOTION- WE WERE ALKING ABOUT CRYING. AND THE DIRECTOR CAME IN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND IT WAS REALLY A DIFFERENT SETTING THAN THE OTHER YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS- BUT IT WAS SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE TRAINING THAT WE DID PREVIOUSLY- WITH MALES OF COLOR- WHEN WE TAUGHT MENTAL HEALTH FOR STATE IN A CULTURALLY RELEVANT MANNER. THEY WERE THE MOST OPEN AND TALKATIVE GROUP OF ALL OF THE GROUPS SO- THERE IS A WAY TO REACH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THE PATHWAY I NEED TO BE NONTRADITIONAL NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY. INVOLVED THESE ARE THEIR MENTORS THAT. THERE IS THERE LEADERS AND SO THE BLEND OF THESE PERSPECTIVES IS REALLY USEFUL IN TERMS OF YOU CAN GAUGE MEANT. AND ENTER A SO A LITTLE ALSO ON THE BROTHER BE WELL PROGRAM IT IT SPEAKS TO THE NEED TO CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS IS A NEW CONCEPT- THAT WE ARE- IN TALKS WITH OUR COUNTY ABOUT FUNDING. AS A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM- SPECIFICALLY FOR MALES OF COLOR BUT IT WOULD ALSO. BE OPEN TO SCHOOLS IT'S A REALLY A PROJECT FOR HIGH SCHOOLS AND FOR COLLEGES- THIS YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION IS ONE OF OUR PARTNERS- WE ALSO HAVE- THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. SO THAT THIS PROJECT CAN BE SCALED INSTANTLY BRINGING TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO THIS PROGRAM- WE ALSO HAD THE STATEWIDE JOB CORPS SYSTEM- SAMUEL MERIT UNIVERSITY THAT BRINGS THE NURSING EXPERTISE TO OUR PROGRAM- AND THEN WELL AS TOGETHER FOR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. AND THAT PRO. IS REALLY IT'S A SAFE SPACE IS WHAT YOU CALL SAFE COMMUNITY IT'S A SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY ALL THESE. MALES ARE SO OPEN AND YOU DO HAVE TO HIM THOUGH GET HIM TO PIPE DOWN AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPRESSION. AND IN SOME OF OUR HOW ARE OUR HOMES THERE JUST ISN'T CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. THIS IS THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT MY FAMILY ME BEING A FAMILY MEMBER WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE USED A FEW DECADES AGO- AND SO- IT DOES GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHING TRAINING. INTERVENTIONS OPENING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND IN OUR RESEARCH SOME OF THEM- A VERY CREATIVE MUSIC AND HUMOR ARE TWO OF THE BIGGEST ASKS IS FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS- IS SO WE ARE INTEGRATING SOME OF THOSE THINGS INTO A DIGITAL PLATFORM. THAT HAS THEM ON THE GROUND OPPORTUNITIES FOR- GETTING TOGETHER TO BE TRAINED TO HEARFROM EXPERTS- AND TO DO IDEATION IDEATION AND HACKING. ARE TWO OF THE THINGS THEIR ON GOING BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THEM ON THIS PROGRAM. REALLY DRIVING A LOT OF IT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO. TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR OUR HEALTH IT IS THAT. MATTER MENTAL HEALTH MATTER WE EXPECT FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS TO- GET INVOLVED AND TO REALLY TO. THAT NEXT STEP IN TO CAN. THESE INTERVENTIONS IS JUST A PART OF THEIR HEALTH. SO AS WE THE WORK WILL KEEP YOU UP. ON THE OUTCOMES OUR CHI. USED SESSIONS THERE MAY BE SOME MORE OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY ASKED FOR THESE. HI THERE IS YOU KNOW IS- KIND OF SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE THEY HAVE A SEVEN CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THEY'RE CONSIDERING DOING SOME THINGS OUT THERE- AND THAT WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BROTHER BE WELL PROGRAM. THANK YOU. OKAY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF A CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR. WITH HIM IN SEARCH OF BY ME- THINK CAN YOU REFRESH MY MEMORY JUST DISCUSS HOW CALIFORNIA IS GROWING AT A LARGER RATE IN TERMS OF FIVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS THAT BEEN TRADITIONALLY BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED AT THE CHARGE AND STARTED IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN GROWING SINCE I THINK YOU HAD TWENTY LIVE IN AN UP. AND I WENT UP FROM. NINE POINT TWO IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWELVE POINT THREE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN I HAVE I DON'T HAVE THE PREVIOUS YEARS BUT- HOUSE THAT. TREND CONTINUED TO GROW WERE WE EVER AT A LOWER HIGHER RATE PRIOR TO THE- EAST WEST INDIES HE SAID SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MAJOR DEPRESSION. EPISODES OF IS NOT ALL OF THE MENTAL DISORDERS. A YOU KNOW A. B. FOUR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE LAST ON AVERAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES ALSO BY THREE JUNE A DIFFERENCES BY AGE AGE GROUPS- A PORN AVERAGE A. B. IT HAS REMAINED A KIND OF LEVEL. BUT SOMETHING HAS BEEN HAPPENING- IN IS NOT THE ONLY CALIFORNIA BASIS NATION WIDE- IN THE LAST THE AT LEAST TEN YEARS BY P. ET SO IT IS AFFECTING AT THE POPULATIONS BAT EIGHTIES WAR SING CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL- LABEL. IF I MAY I JUST ME WHEN YOU SET THAT BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MANY REASONS WHY YOU KNOW OUR POPULATION IS TO PRESS THE VANS PERSONAL HISTORY. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I GO BACK TO- MY EXPERIENCE AS AN EDUCATOR I MEAN I REMEMBER PRIOR TO THAT THE DEPRESSION ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT OR NINE WHERE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES IN. AND SO THERE WERE SO MANY CUTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND I REMEMBER WE USED TO HAVE FULL TIME COUNSELORS. AND I CAN TELL YOU HOW VALUABLE THOSE COUNSELORS WORK TO ME IN TERMS OF HAVING STUDENTS WITH ISSUES THEY WOULD GO TO THE COUNSELOR THAT COUNTS FOR NOT ONLY WOULD WORK WITH THE STUDENTS BUT- THEY WOULD CONNECT WITH THE PARENTS AND THEN HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF THE INSURANCE AND HOW DO YOU GET. OUTSIDE HELP AND SELL THAT EARLY TREATMENT. WAS ESSENTIAL AND I JUST WONDER THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN. ALL THE SERVICES WE'VE LOST IN THE SCHOOLS AS IT PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH LIKE OUR COUNSELORS AND- AND YOU KNOW WE USED TO HAVE THERAPISTS. LOSING THEM AND NOW NOT HAVING ANYTHING IN SCHOOL TO KINDA HELP THE EARLY STAGES AND- I'M JUST WONDERING IF. YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE IT LIKE AGAIN WE HAD SOMEONE THAT WE CAN SEND. OUR STUDENTS TO THAT WOULD HAVE A ONE ON ONE AND I THINK MRS SMITH YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT. HAVING A RELATIONSHIP MENTORS YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE OR AT LEAST OUR YOUTH ARE. MORE INCLINED TO SPEAK UP AND THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP LOW OF IT SOMEONE THAT THEY BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH. AND SO I'M JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES IT'S A GREAT POINT BY A NINETY AYE EVA. I THINK THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP. A UNFORTUNATELY I THINK A- THAT BY WE HAVE INDOOR. AS AS GOOD A JOB AS WE COULD. IN PARTNERING WITH SCHOOLS. FOR EXAMPLE SO TEACHERS. ARE BEARING FORM. ON HOW TO IDENTIFY. SYMPTOMS US. ORDER OR SIGNS. A SURLY S. PORTABLE. AIN'T BEEN UNFORTUNATELY. IS STILL. YOU KNOW THE BETTER TEACHERS THAT TALK ABOUT THE- DIESEL BEATING KIDS. OR OR KEY STEP BUT YOU KNOW JUST THEM PAY ATTENTION. WITHOUT THINKING THAT. SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOING ON. IN THEIR LIVES. EIGHTEEN AND I THINK. THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO CLASSES THAT TEND TO BE BIGGER. THAN BEFORE SO THEY MORE- A PERSONALIZED SO ATTENTION. HE NOT BEAR. SOMETHING GOOD BUDDIES- HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND USE- IS IN THE THIRD BILL HAD BEEN A CHAMPION OF THAT THESE- WELLNESS CENTERS. YOU KNOW IT IS A HOW TO COME UP. WITH THE- A. INTERVENTIONS. PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE KIDS ALONG WITH A BIT THE PARENTS AND ALONG WITH THAT A- ADMINISTRATORS AND THE TEACHERS- I IDENTIFY- DAY SIGNS WHEN THEY ARE THERE OR- AIM FOR A- DREAM FORCE. A WELLBEING RELATED ACTIVITIES. AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT POINT AND I THINK IT UNDERSCORES- THE NEED FOR TEACHERS TED TO BE EDUCATED IN THIS. IN THIS ARENA IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AS A TEACHER YOU'RE NOT TAUGHT TO BE A MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS AND YOU'RE THERE TO TEACH AND- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING NOW. THERE IS NO RESOURCES SO TEACHERS HAVE TO BE BAIT THAT THEIR BEST SO TO SPEAK- AND I THINK IT ALSO UNDERSCORES THE NEED. FOR ARTS CENTERS COOL NO ARTS TO. OVER THE YEARS A AND I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER I. MRS SMITH DOT. KIDS X. THEM AND ARE ABLE TO RESUME OF THE IN THE KNOW THAT THINGS IDEA THEY'RE FEELING THROUGH THE- AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW IMPORTANT THE ARTS ARE. HALF PLEASE IN SCHOOLS ALL THAT IS COMMENTED ON THE MANDATES AND TERMS OF YOU KNOW MATH AND SCIENCE AND IT JUST YOU KNOW THE CORE CURRICULUM IS. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I THINK WE'RE FORGETTING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET THOSE KIDS THAT NEED TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES ANOTHER AVENUE TO RELEASE OUR ANXIETY AND BE ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT THEY'RE FEELING BUT I THINK I JUST WANTED TO SEE BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THE THAT THE GRAPH HAS IT. YOU KNOW STARTED UP INCREASING I LIKE FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TEN NOW AND IT'S JUST IT'S GROWN DRAMATICALLY AND NOW WE'RE ALL DOING- THE UNITED STATES AND- AGAIN I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME IS SEEING. THE LOSS OF OUR COUNSELORS IN OUR SCHOOLS- THE LOSS OF OUR ART SYSTEM IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO ALL THIS HATING PLAYS INTO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW LATER IN LIFE BUT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL TO BE I THINK. YOU'RE DOING A CREDIBLE WORK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS I THINK IT' IMPORTANT TO HAVE IT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ART IS IN MAKING IT OKAY TO SPEAK UP ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE FEELING I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO LET OUR KIDS KNOW THAT. THAT IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK UP AND GET HELP AND SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLE. THANK YOU BOTH. YOU ENTER MONNING. ONE THING YOU BOTH FOR YOUR SOME A QUESTION FOR MISS SMITH ON THE LISTENING SESSIONS- THIS PROFILE THE THREE THAT WERE HELD SACRAMENTO OAKLAND FRESNO. SEEMS LIKE A GREAT MODEL ARE THERE PLANS TO TRY TO REPLICATE THIS WATER THE LIMITATIONS WAS THE FUNDING THROUGH KAISER PERMANENTE IN ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO TRY TO REPLICATE THESE SIR GIVE STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ONE A CHANCE FOR FOLLOW UP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- YES THESE ARE FUNDED THROUGH KAISER PERMANENTE A THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS DIVISION THE REGIONAL DIVISION OUT OF OAKLAND- AND AT THIS TIME- THERE AREN'T PLANS TO FURTHER AND THE YOUTH LISTENING SESSIONS IN OUR- REGION BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WON'T DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE- WE ALSO HAVE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE BENEFITS DIVISION INTERESTED- SO. HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUSH FORWARD ON ON THAT- I THOUGHT THAT THE YOUTH ADVOCATES WHO APPEARED ON OUR PANEL WOULD BE FANTASTIC SPOKESPEOPLE FOR A CONTINUED SERIES- THEY'RE VERY- WELL VERSED IN AND LOOKING FORWARD TO OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHER YOUTH- BUT IT ALSO COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A REIMAGINING SOME EL CAP DOLLARS. THERE IS A FOCUS ON A YOUTH OF COLOR OR I'M SORRY- YOU TO OUR- UNDERSERVED- A FOSTER YOUTH AND- THERE'S ANOTHER. GROUP I DON'T REMEMBER BUT- THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET THESE THINGS MOVING DIRECTLY AT THE SCHOOLS- SO SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PERHAPS PITCH RIGHT WILL YOU READ MY MIND ON THAT TRYING TO ORGANIZE A FREE STANDING ON GOING. OPPORTUNITY VERSUS PARTNERING SCHOOLS ALSO WITH LIMITED RESOURCES BUT AS YOU MENTION OF IT COULD BE PRIORITIZED AS PART OF AN EL CAP. PLAN MAYBE PICK A FEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO COMMIT TO SOME EXPERIMENTATION LATE TEN AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN LONG BEACH A FEW YEARS AGO. WHERE STUDENTS. ARE LET IN HERE CONVERSATION AS AS AS A- CHRIS. CLASS CURRICULUM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ONCE A WEEK IN THE START IN SHELLS IN NOT BEING OPEN IN THE END UP. BECOMING FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS AS THEY NAVIGATE HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AND OTHER HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM- SO IT SEEMS LIKE. WHERE THE ATTENTION IS PUT TO ALLOW YOUNG PEOPLE. TO HAVE AVOICE THE RESULTS. TEND TO BE POSITIVE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF OUR LORD THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER JUST QUICK QUESTION DOCTOR SERGIO- HOW MANY PSYCHIATRISTS ARE UC DAVIS PRODUCING EVERY YEAR. IT IS NOT ENOUGH CERTAINTY BUT I EIGHTIES. THERE ARE GENERAL PSYCHIATRIST IN BETTER CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE IN THE GENERAL CATEGORY HE PRODUCES- CERTAINLY MORE THAN NINE. EIGHTIES ABOUT THE I THINK THAT TWELVE FIFTEEN BUT I CAN COME TO YOU WITH THAT PARTICULAR NUMBER AS WELL. IN BY THE WAY HE SAID GREAT THE QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW WHEN THAT IS PUTTING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE- A WAR FORCE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE HAVING IN BAY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS. HIS CHEST THE DRAMATIC A UC DAVIS ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS NOW. HE SAID NOT ONLY TRAINING- IT TRAINING INTERESTED DANCE A IAN COMBINED PROGRAMS AS WE CALL THEM A INTERNAL MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY. OR FAMILY MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY AND MORE RECENTLY WE STARTED A TRAIN THE TRAINERS PROGRAM BUT WE CALLED PRIMARY CARE IN PSYCHIATRY. IN THE LAST COUNT THE A. B. C. SO I ONE YEAR CERTIFICATES IN THE LAST COUNT. WE HAD TWO HUNDRED LEARNERS TRAINED IN DEATH MORAL BECAUSE THERE IS THE- RECOGNITION THAT NEED TO TREAT THE- EQUIP. OUR WORKFORCE PRIMARY CARE WERE FOR FORCE WITH BETTER TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN IN ORDER ORDER- THE PRIMARY CARE DOCKS FOR EXAMPLE FROM MY WILL BE G. WAY IN TO PAY THE OUT THREE. OF YOUR CREATIONS- FAMILY MEDICINE IT BABY GET BORN AVERAGE ABOUT TWO WEEKS OF TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY MODE NEARLY ENOUGH. AND YET THEY ARE THE ONES ON THE FROM THE YOU KNOW- ROLE TO SEE THESE CASES AND BURY SO THE YOU KNOW A NOT THE UP APPROPRIATE IDENTIFICATION AND THEREFORE APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS FOR THOSE. PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER YOU. OF THE STORE QUESTION FOR BOTH THIRD THIRD. EARLIER IN THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE THERE'S A DISPARITY BETWEEN. THAT THE HEALTH CARE OF USE THAT ARE LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN. WHAT IS THE ANSWER THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO HAVE ON THAT ISSUE WHAT'S THE ANSWER HOW DO I HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT DISPARITY AND DOES THAT REFLECT LIKE WHEN YOU YOU GAVE US INFORMATION AT AT. AFFECTS IS YOU WERE BOTH. DISCUSSING THINGS LIKE FOSTER CARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALL THE- YOU KNOW OTHER HEALTH CARE% PROBLEMS- EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT WORK ECONOMIC ATTAINMENT ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE AFFECTED- WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITY IN YOUR OPINION- AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING- A NATIONALLY IN. THE CALIFORNIA OF. MENTAL HEALTH CALIFORNIA IS PART OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAM SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE TWO. EXPERTS ON THIS DISPARITY ISSUE WHAT WE CAN DO IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I FIRST- THANK YOU. I THINK THAT IT TAKES THOSE- ON THE GROUND PARTNERSHIPS- FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS RECENTLY CONTRACTED WITH THIS YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION TO ADMINISTER THESE SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION PROGRAM IT'S A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR EFFORT- THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH INVOLVED IN THAT DEALING WITH ALL THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT THEY WANT THAT COMPONENT AS WELL- IT'S SO THE ZERO HEALTH FOUNDATION WITHIN REACH INTO ITS NETWORK IT HAS ITS- TENANTS ON THE GROUND. AND IT WILL IT FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN REACH THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY AND THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO GO DIRECT TO THE SOURCE TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAMS IT COULD BE A CHURCH IT COULD BE A COMMUNITY CENTER COULD BE AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM- THEY ALREADY HAVE TWO THREE FOUR HUNDRED YOUTH IN THEIR PROGRAM IS NO REASON TO REALLY REINVENT THE WHEEL. BUT THOSE PROGRAMS TEND TO NOT HAVE ANY MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AT ALL OR CURRICULUM NOTHING SO- IT'S A GREAT PARTNERSHIP IN LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN. DEVELOP THOSE GROUND PARTNERSHIPS AND GIVE THEM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DO THE WORK THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE WAYS THAT OF THE WE COULD WE COULD GET THIS DONE. THANK YOU YES QUE IF I CAN VERY QUICKLY A- WHAT IS REQUIRED IS. CIRCUIT EFFORT. ACROSS YOU KNOW IT IS NOT CHEST THE HEALTH SECTOR BOB THE SCHOOLS CHURCHES LAW ENFORCEMENT A SOCIAL SERVICES IT CENTER HAS TO BE IN VERY OUR FOCUS ON PREVENT ON EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND EARLY PREVENTION IN WITHIN THAT'S RAIL THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. SENATE FOR A THE A I HAVE A LEASE HERE OFF AT LEAST EIGHT TEAMS THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE FROM IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING- KIDS AT RISK. EIGHT TO BE COPING PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS PROMOTE CONNECT CONNECTEDNESS WITH CHEESE WEB PAGE A ONE THE CENTERS TO. A CREATE PROTECT THE BEEN BARN MEANS A STRENGTHENING AXIS IN BELIEVE EVERY AT OF CARE. IN THE STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC SUPPORT IN A IN I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIG BIG CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THE COURT IN A CHILD POLICY. BOB HOW ARE KIDS OUGHT TO BE DEVELOPING THEMSELVES IN THE SENSE THAT THAT. A OUR KIDS YOU ARE NOT THAT WELL EQUIPPED TO THINK TO- FOR THAT DALY. THIS RACE THAT THEY ARE FACING A SENATOR SO I THINK THAT IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK TOGETHER AND WE CAN COME UP WITH THE- S. SERIES SOFA OFF INTERVENTIONS- BY THE FAST TO BE A CONCERTED. EFFORT A NECRO SECTORS. PROMOTED YOU CAN GO AND TO BECAUSE I WAS TO DEAL WITH BUDGET. THE GENERAL I THINK I JUST LIKE TO LAW LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET REQUEST SO- IS THERE WAY TO PROVE THAT THE THIS WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF. IF WE HAD THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. I THINK THAT THE BAND ARE SO MUCH ECONOMIC- A KONAMI SOCIETIES THAT HAD BEEN DONE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE OR WHAT ARE DAY LOSSES A WHEN WE LOSE KIDS TO SUICIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IN BERRY SOME BUSINESS CASE THAT CAN BE DONE. THAT I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU. WE'RE GETTING TO THAT TO THAT POINT BY THE WAY ON ON HOW WE CAN MAKE. THE CASE THAT BC SO A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT- OKAY WELL THANK YOU BOTH HIS REMAINING- AND GIVE US INFORMATION- WILL MORE UNDER LAST PANEL AND THAT'S A MORE USERS- BEAR ON AND- STEVE OLSON THESE ARE. PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY RUN PROGRAMS THAT. DEAL WITH CHILDREN AND- THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTINUE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO PEDIATRIC CARE AND- THIRTY AND THE FULL CONTINUES SERVICES DIVERSION AND EXPANDING SERVICES SO WELCOME GERMAN. AND WAYS SHOULD TAKE YOUR FIRST RIGHT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- REALLY PUT THERE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMON. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE SOME BRING AWARENESS VERY IMPORTANT SELECTJUST TAKE A MINUTE TO INTRODUCE THIS ON THE- CENTER FOR CHILDREN SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ON THE WORK THEY WERE DOING WE ARE THE OLDEST NONPROFIT SERVICING CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN SAN DIEGO CELEBRATING ACTUALLY THIS MONTH A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE YEARS I'LL- BE PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF THERAPEUTIC AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES- TOUCHING THE LIVES ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WE'RE ALSO NATIONALLY ACCREDITED WE'RE ALSO PROUD MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LINES FOR CHILD AND FAMILY SIR THIS. HAS SOME OF THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ON A FORTY AND ORGANIZATIONS AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA SUCH AS LIKE BECAUSE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE CAUSING CASA PACIFICA ARE IS THAT WE REALLY GET TO PARTNER WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF CARE WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE KNOW THE NONPROFIT. SO WE'RE ON THE GROUND REALLY TRYING TO NAVIGATE FOR THE NEEDS OF THE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND THERE ARE SOME THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SOME IDEAS THAT HAVE A FOR HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE- OF CARE I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT DATE OUT BECAUSE I WAS. HAPPY AND RELIEVED TO SEE THAT THERE STEP THAT I CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HAS BEEN THERE'S A INSTEAD DID HOMEWORK WELL I TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. A COUPLE ARE NOW WHAT ABOUT APPROXIMATELY 25% OF CHILDREN IN YOUTH IN OUR IN OUR OUR COMMUNITIES X. A MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDER. ALL THE INDICATORS OF A KEY T. THIRTY ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. BOB GREATEST HALL. IN SAN DIEGO ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN. THE IF THAT WE'RE PUTTING. REPORTED ANY. OF EIGHT PER. NUMBER ROOM SEKAI EMERGE. IN IN THE OF EIGHT YEARS THAT NGUYEN FROM IT FOR HER. TO TWO EIGHT AND AS WE BEFORE ALSO WERE VERY CONCERNED A SUICIDE HAS NOT BECOME THE SECOND LEADING- BECAUSE OF DEBT IN CAN CHILDREN ARE AND YOU. SO WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT CAN BE DONE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF ACCESS AND ACCESS TO CARE- WE KNOW IT WAS SAID BEFORE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE BEING SPRINGS BUT I COMMUNITIES 50% OF THEM MANIFEST THEMSELVES FOR SAID BEFORE BY AGE FOURTEEN SO I CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION TO POTENTIALLY COULD TARGET 50% OF THE PROBLEM BY PAYING ATTENTION TO IT SO WE WERE TO PAY ATTENTION TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THAT NONE OF FOR SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES EARLY ON WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP WHERE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND EARLY INTERVENTION ARE KEY TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES THE SOONER WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE PROBLEMS TO BETTER IT IS VERY CONCERNING THAT SOME MOST STUDIES INDICATE THAT 6280% OF YOU IN CALIFORNIA IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL DRAW THE COUNTRY ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT THESE PROBLEMS CONTINUING DEVELOPED. TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE CHALLENGING AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE OTHER SYSTEMS OF CARE BEING IMPACTED WEEPING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE CHAPTER IN SAN DIEGO AND THEY RIP TO GET THROUGH SEARCH MORE THAN 25% OF THE CASES IN THE PRACTICES ARE RELATED TO MENTAL EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS SO THEY'RE SEEING A NEED TO DO MORE AND THEY'RE SEEING A NEED TO MAYBE DO MORE SCREENING SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE IS A SCREENING SOLD HAPPENING PEDIATRIC PRACTICES. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS DâN. I THINK ANOTHER IMPORTANT COME. IS TO THINK A IT FROM THE FIRST. OF A FAN SIX HELP. OUR IF YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH EXPERIENCE SOME CHAO. FOR TO BE TO ATTEND WOMEN GOING ON. WHERE TO GO HOW TO ACCESS SERVICES TO HAVE THE RIGHT NEEDS. ARE THE RIGHT RESOURCES WHERE DO I GO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDER OF CARE. THAT CAN BE VERY VERY CONFUSING. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION. TO PAGE FIVE FROM THE PRESENTATION THAT YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. YEAH ARMED AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION IT VERY VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOW PATIENT. AND THEY THINK ABOUT IN PATIENT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF MORE TRADITIONAL COMPONENTS OF PEOPLE. EQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WEEK. REALITY WE NEED A FULL CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT GOES FROM. INTEGRATED CARE THAT HAPPENED IN IN THAT CAN HELP. TO PRACTICES OF PATIENT MENTAL HEALTH WHICH MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH. BUT THERE'S ALSO IN HOME THERAPEUTIC SERVICES THAT COULD BE VERY VERY EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE VERY VASTLY UNDERUTILIZED. ON A MORE INTENSE WARY WAY OF PROVIDING INCOME THERAPIES WRAPAROUND. MOBILE CRISIS BECOMES ALSO AN IMPORTANT WAY ON MY COLLEAGUES GOING TO BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT. AND WE ALSO HAVE HOSPITAL DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE. SO JUST INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS ON A PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION WE HAVE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT ARE WE HAVING PATIENT. THEN WHEN YOU LOOK T THE DIFFERENT PAIRS OF THE SERVICES WHICH WOULD BE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE ABOUT COVERING ABOUT THE LOSS ABOUT THE- SEVEN PERCENT. MANAGE COMMITTEE CAL ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. AND MENTAL HEALTH PLAN S COUNTY BEHAVIORAL SERVICES ABOUT FOUR TO SIX PERCENT. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT ARE NOT BEING COVERED BY SOME OF THE SYSTEMS OF CARE. ARE THE BEST. SO FOR EXAMPLE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IS NOT COVERING. IN HOME THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AND ACTUALLY WEEPING IN CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED CARE HEALTH SERVICES. TO BE ABLE TO CONVENE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH OUR- A- HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BENEFITS ON THE- NOT ONLY FROM. A CARE POINT OF VIEW BUT FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW. TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. AND ALSO THESE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST BETWEEN MANAGE COMMITTEE CALENDAR NOT. THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED AND ALSO WITH MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. SPEAKS TO AN OPPORTUNITY THAT EXIST TODAY WITH THE MEDICAL HELP YOU CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. TO REALLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT EXISTING MOVING PEOPLE FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. AND THREE ABLE TO ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED SO WE FEEL THAT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO SPEAKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE. FIRST ARE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHOLE FAMILY. AND TO BE THINKING A FAMILY CENTER. TO BE THE WITH THE FOOD DEVELOPMENT. THAT WE CALL EMPOWER FAMILIES WHERE WE CREATED AN ASSESSMENT TOOL THE BEEPING WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT WILL HELP ASIDE INTO WHAT ONE OF THE NEEDS NOT ONLY OF THE U. BUT ALSO OF THE FAMILY AS THE RELEASE OF TAKING CARE OF THEIR NEEDS. SO WE'LL DO THAT WE LOOK AT CHAO FUNCTIONING AND THE CONCERNS OF THE PARENTS OF CARE GIVERS HALF. LOOK AT THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILY WHAT KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THEY'RE ACCESSING. AND ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE NATURAL SUPPORTS OUR- TO THE% EXTENT THAT THOSE CAN BE ARE ALSO. A OBTAINED WE HAVE. WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS HELP PUT THESE RESOURCES ON A WEB BASED APPLICATION. SO WHEN FAMILIES COME TO SEE US WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. AND OUR TEAM. PUTS TOGETHER THE STATE OF THIS FAMILY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS INTO COMPREHENSIVE PLANS OF ACTION. IS SENDING HAND SCARE APPROACH WHICH WE CALL FAMILY ACTION PLANS SO NOT ONLY WE ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EARLY WITH FAMILY WRAPAROUND. IN A WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT SO WE IDENTIFY WHAT IS HIS FAMILY NEED AND HOW WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND TO GET WHAT THEY NEED. SO WE'VE BEEN PILOTING THESE WORK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WE HAVE ARE GETTING SOME VERY GOOD RESULTS ARE IN TERMS OF. THE IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME TO PASS. SO THE NEXT OF FOR RULES WAS TO PARTNER WITH WOULD RATED CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN SAN DIEGO. AND WE HAVE CREATED AN INTEGRATED QUICK CATCH A QUICK PACE APPROACH SO WE'RE PLACING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN PEDIATRIC CLINICS. ARE IN IN OUR COUNTY. AND WHEN THE PHYSICIANS IDENTIFY A FAMILY BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING SCREENINGS THAT REQUIRING SOME COUPLE SUPPORT. THEY WILL REFER THEM TO US AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT SENDING THEM OUT. INTO THE COMMUNITY AND FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCING THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES. WE'RE ABLE TO SEE THEM RIGHT THERE ARE THE SAME PEDIATRIC CLINIC. BY THE TIME THEY COME TO SEE AS WE ALREADY HAVE. HELLO OF DATA ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE SAN. IS AN WE CAN. TO IT EMPLOY THE RANGE OF. WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE CON. TO THE VISIT. AND THE TO MAKE CRISIS RIGHT THERE. AT THE PEDIATRIC CLEAN. USING THIS KIND OF. A FOR LOST CONNECT ON THE- AND WE- NOW. JUST ABOUT ONE OF THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF PARKING. THAT SCARY FOR A CHILD OF THE MENTAL DISABILITY. OR A CHILD WITH A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM AND WE HAVE SOME DATA ON IT PUT AN EXAMPLE OF THE BACK OF HIS PRESENTATION. ABOUT COLLABORATIVE CARE AS WELL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRING THE SERVICES TO WERE FAMILIES ARE AN INTEGRATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF AN MEDI CAL A REIMAGINING THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN THE STATE'S IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT SO WE ALREADY WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE THAT WORK AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW THIS DISC WITH THIS COULD FUNCTION IF YOU COULD IF I COULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO SLIDE. EIGHT THERE'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. BRING UP TO YOU. SO THE WAY THE SYSTEM COULD WORK IS THAT IF THE PEDIATRICIAN IS WILLING TO SCREENING AND IDENTIFY AS EARLY AS CAN BE THE CHALLENGE OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT YOU TO THE FAMILY MAY BE EXPERIENCING. MAKE A REFERRAL- TO THE FAMILY NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO OUR TEAM TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE FAMILY NEEDS WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO PROVIDE THE CARE FOR THE FAMILY. MODELS FOR THE USER BUT ALSO IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THEY NEED. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT WE ARE BUILDING THIS CONTINUUM OF THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. FROM OUR PATIENTS SCHOOL BASED SERVICES INTENSIVE IN HOME SERVICES HOSPITAL THE VERSION AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND NOW WE CAN LINK THE SERVICES. WITH PEDIATRIC CARE. SO IT'S A FULL CONTINUUM THERE WERE BUILDING IN SAN DIEGO IN PARTNERSHIP A TRADE IS A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. THAT REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TAKE US FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER AND STEP YOUTH UP OR DOWN. DEPENDING ON ON WHAT WE NEED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON AND WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE THE FUTURE. SO. VIEW OF. ABLE MINUTES AGO A QUICK WAS BEING ASKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A- WAND SO I WOULD GRAB. ALLOW RAPID THAT THIS WAS GOING IF I MAY. UM A THING ON THE ONE HAND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COST. ARE THERE ARE DOING THE WORK AND WORKING AND INTERACTING WITH THESE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF CARE A LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS AND I'LL TESTING SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. WE WOULD REALLY WORK ON THE OPPORTUNITY. AND RADIUS CHILDREN HOSPITAL WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT COULD BE REPLICATED HE COULD BE THEN BROUGHT INTO ALL THE COMMUNITIES. AND WE COULD IDENTIFY THE WASTE THE WAY TO BRING IT TO SCALE. UP TO. HEAR THE WORD THAT IT'S BEEN DONE NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE MAY HELP ALLOWS TO REALLY CREATE A MORE ROBOTS CONTINUUM FOR THOSE WHO ARE COVER. TO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE- DOT COMPONENT BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT- IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO REMOVE. ANY KIND OF BARRIERS THAT EXIST TODAY BETWEEN MANAGE CARE MEDICARE AND THE HEALTH PLANS. IS REALLY A CHALLENGE IS DIFFICULT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY TO FORKS. AND THE LAST THING I WOULD LIKE TO BRING. IS A COMPONENT TO WORK FORCE ON. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN FOR ALMOST PROVIDING SERVICES. FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T HAVE CLEAR DATA ABOUT THE DATA BALK WITH THE VISITATION RATES FOR A MANAGED CARE- MENTAL HEALTH A MEDICAL PLANS. SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION TO COVER ARE RECEIVING AND PLUS ESPECIALLY. BUT PROVIDERS. IF THE POP. FOR MANAGE CARE A MEDICAL PROBLEM EIGHT COME. TO PROVIDER A TO BE TO. A ACCEPT AND BE ABLE TO CREATE THE- INTERNS UNDER SUPER. TODAY A WHEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. THAT DRAWS MEDI CAL DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR SPECIALTY HELD. WEEKEND CREDENTIAL INTERNS FROM THE SUPERVISION AND WE CONTROL MEDI CAL WELL THE COUNTY CONTROL MEDICAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO CALL THIS A- COVER THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL. AT NIGHT OF. GAVE YOU A COPY ALSO IN THE PACKET TO A MEDICAL UPDATE. HE WAS A BULLET TEEN FROM AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THAT IN THE CASE THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN MEDICAID OR MEDICARE AL THAT PREVENTS STOP FROM HAPPENING. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A HELPFUL SOLUTION BECAUSE IF MEDI CAL RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT FOG. OR TEND TO BE LOWER. AREN'T THERE A LOT OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT ABLE OR WILLING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS. ARE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A SHORT. OF PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. IF WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COSTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT EXIST. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE INTERNATIONAL THE SUPERVISION WITH- WITH PROGRAMS THAT ARE NATIONALLY ACCREDITED. TO BE ABLE TO OUR WORK WITH INSURANCE NOT ONLY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TRAIN PROVIDERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GOING TO THIS LINE OF WORK WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP AND I JUST WANTED TO ALSO MENTION TWO TWO AND- AGAIN WE HAVE DATA ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS APPROACH. BUT WE ALSO HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT FAMILIES WHEN THEY COME TO GET SERVICES REALLY BRING IN MORE MORE THAN JUST A CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE ABOUT THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR SYMPTOMS. MAY HELP THERE'S MULTI SIX TO MAKE CHALLENGES AND THE THING IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO ASSESS THEM SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP LISTED PLANS. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU WOULD GO TO LAST. NO SOME POOR NEAR FROM PUBLIC. SO STEVE WILSON IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CASA PACIFICA. CENTERS FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND- I TURN IT OVER TO USE THE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WELL- FRANK HERE THANK YOU FOR. PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS. ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC I'LL BE BRIEF AND TURNED OUT TO BE. DUPLICATIVE OF FOUR TURRET AND TALKED ABOUT BUT A BRIEF INTRODUCTION- TO CASA PACIFICA WE'RE LOCATED IN VENTURA COUNTY IN CAMERA RIO ACTUALLY WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE ACRE CAMPUS. WE WERE LAUNCHED- TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO FOCUS ON KIDS WHO WERE. IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- AND. FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS TWENTY ONE YEARS OF OUR- EXISTENCE WE'VE EXCLUSIVELY SERVED KIDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THAT'S ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE IN BOTH SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES NOW PROVIDING COMMUNITY BASED AND CAMPUS BASED SERVICES. WHERE ALSO IN APA PER PRE DOCTORAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. ONE OF THE FEW IN CALIFORNIA REALLY IN THE COUNTRY- SPECIALIZING IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND- WE GET TO A- UNIDADES PRODUCTOR CANDIDATES IN PSYCHOLOGY FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO. WHO WE WANT TO WORK WITH KIDS WHO ARE ON THE DEEP END OF SYSTEM WHICH IS THE WAY WE THINK I THINK ABOUT SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO FOCUS ON WAS THE- DIFFERENCES IN IN INSURANCE- PROVIDERS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT MEDICAID AS A- AS BASICALLY A HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. CAN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH KERR ABOUT THE BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO KIDS WHO WHO MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY. IS REALLY A RICH BENEFIT PACKAGE EPS D. T. YEAR EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT THE PROGRAM. THE MANDATED PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN- THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WHO MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY AND ARE ARE RECEIVING MEDICAID IS REALLY A RICH BENEFIT PACKAGE. ON THE OTHER- ON THE PRIVATE SIDE IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD THE BENEFIT pACTUALLY PRETTY SLAM. TRADITIONALLY AND MARCH THIS IS ALREADY POINTED THIS OUT WE THINK ABOUT- HOSPITALIZATION OR IN THE OFFICE OUT PATIENT SERVICES AND THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT IT WHILE ON THE MEDICAID SIDE THERE'S- WE CAN BE IN WHAT I WOULD CALL IS SEEKING MODE RATHER THAN A WAITING MODE THE TRADITIONAL. SORT OF SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN THE OFFICE YOU YOU WAIT FOR THAT CLIENT PATIENT TO COME TO YOU. VERSES IS SEEKING MODE WHERE YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE DELIVERING SERVICES WHERE. THE PROBLEMS EXIST SO I THINK THERE'S A- HUGE DIFFERENCE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL PLANTS EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE EVEN. IN THE INDIVIDUAL. AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE MEDICAID SIDE SO WHEN I TALK DIRTY IT'S NOT PARITY SO MUCH BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH A LITTLE BIT SO. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE IT'S PARITY BETWEEN PORTS AVAILABLE ON THE PUBLIC SIDE IN WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON THE PRIVATE SIDE. SO WE LAUNCHED- INTO THE COMMERCIAL WORLD IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSURANCE CARRIERS- WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH KAISER. ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AT NOW. OPTIM ARE WE ALSO DO SINGLE CASE AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER. INSURANCE CARRIERS- AND WE NOW PROVIDE A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE- REYES AND THIS IS NOW AVAILABLE. THROUGH SOME PILOTS THAT HAVE BEEN- SORT OF ORCHESTRATED OR. KIND OF FACILITATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND OTHER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAVE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT WHICH ARE KIND OF TRADITIONAL SERVICES. BOTH ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AND KAISER. I HAVE GOTTEN INTERESTED IN WHAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE PUBLIC SIDE AND I THINK THEY SEE IN HOME SERVICES AND IS SEEKING MODE AS- AS BEING GOOD FOR BUSINESS IT'S KIND OF A BOTTOM LINE DECISION FOR THEM. AND SO WE'VE BEEN PILING THAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. RESERVE KIDS AGE NINE TO SEVENTEEN OUR IN HOME SERVICES GO AS LOW AS FOUR YEARS OLD. KIDS WITH EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS. AND CO OCCURRING DISORDERS SUBSTANCE ABUSE. ARE WE BEGIN TO SPECIALIZE IN WHAT WE CALL GENDER EXPANSIVE SERVICES LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THAT KIDS WHO- IDENTIFY A AS A GENDER EXPANSIVE ARE- DISPROPORTIONATE IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. OUR TREATMENT MODEL IS DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY PRIMARILY ALTHOUGH WE USE A BUNCH OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE BUT IN TERMS OF THE WILL OF PHALLIC BELIEVE HALOTI OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT WE SEE DB TIAS THE- TREATMENT OF CHOICE. WE NOW HAVE FOUR LEVELS OF CARE AS MUCH AS SAID KIDS CAN STEP UP AND DOWN DEPENDING ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE PRIMARILY STEPPING DOWN FROM RESIDENTIAL INTO PHP IOP AN ENTITY AND HOME COMMUNITY- SERVICES ON AMAZON SKIP OVER THESE SLIDES THE- BUT- I ALREADY MENTIONED WHAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH MEDIC COW. STARTING WITH A MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN WE OPERATE THE MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY RIGHT NOW FOR ADOLESCENTS. THE COUNTY HANDLES THE ADULTS SO- WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST HISTORICALLY WHEN WE PROVIDED. MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES RESPONDED TO A CRISIS FOR A FAMILY THAT HAS COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WE TALKED TO THE INSURANCE KERRIER ABOUT- BILLING THEM THEY SAY THAT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTION. WHERE WE DON'T PAY FOR THAT ANTHEM HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT TACT AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY- NOW ARE SUPPORTING. FAMILIES WHO HAVE THEIR OWN INSURANCE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THAT STARTED OUT AS A PILOT THERE SO MOBILE CRISIS WE CAN BILL AND TOM AND WE CAN MAKE ASSESSMENTS AND DETERMINE WHAT THE FAMILY OR THE USE NEED IN ADDITION THERE'S CRISIS STABILIZATION. CRISIS STABILIZATION SKEWS ME- TWENTY THREE OUR SERVICE WRAPAROUND WHICH I THINK YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND THERAPEUTIC PAYROLL SERVICES BOTH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS- RUNNING- WELL OVER SIX HUNDRED EPISODES IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHILDREN- CAN YOU WE'RE SAYING REALLY GOOD OUTCOMES THE REFERRALS. IN THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WORLD COME PRIMARILY FROM INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH- AND- WE'RE SITTING REALLY GOOD RESULTS WE- SEE A REAL SHORTAGE OF- BOB PROVIDERS THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE IS HIRING CLINICIANS WHO CAN DELIVER THIS SERVICE- FAN IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THAT- WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THANK EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM WOULD. APPRECIATE THAT. I AND OUR OUTCOMES ARE VERY POSITIVE SO WHERE ARE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MY SIS MENTIONED. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE- CAN- IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA DO A CONVENING WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH KAISER ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. AND SUGGEST THAT OTHER CARRIERS SO LOOK AT EXPANDING THEIR BENEFIT PACKAGE WHICH WOULD BE IN THEIR INTERESTS FINANCIALLY SO- PREVENT WITHOUT OUT IN TEN. THE APPARATUS QUESTIONS. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- AND YOU'RE SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT MEDICO IS BETTER WIDER BROTHER SERVICE THEN THIS IS FOR BOTH YOU GUYS. THEN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE LAWS AT THIS TIME IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES OKAY AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO REALLY DICTATE A BENEFIT PACKAGE WELL HERE'S BUT BUT I THINK- THERE IS WE CAN DO A LAWN OKAY. BUT TRIED FOUR TIMES GOOD THE P. I THINK IF A RANGE OF SERVICES IT'S I THINK IT'S IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTERESTS TO BE PROVIDING SERVICES IN HOME- AND AVOIDING HOSPITALIZATIONS DO YOU GO AHEAD YEAH I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THAT- THAT A I THINK THE DEFINITELY THERE'S GOING TO BE ROOM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATION WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF DOING THIS. ON THE MEDICAL SIDE YEARS OR MORE RANGE OF OPTIONS BUT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS LIKE THIS TO SYSTEM NOW WE HAVE BETWEEN MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WITH THE COUNTIES OF MAKES IT SOMETIMES DIFFERENT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE THOSE TO SYSTEMS EVEN THOUGH THE BENEFIT MAYBE THERE SOMETIMES YOU MAY BE CHALLENGING CHALLENGING TO ACCESS IT SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO A. TO INVESTORS AS WELL. DID YOU DO. THANK THE BEACH THE TWO SYSTEM. IF THE REMAIN LIKE TO ARE THERE WOULD BE. PEOPLE IN FAMILIES THAT WOULD DROP INTO THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE OR IS IT HAPPENING NOW. WHERE THEY HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE WELL THEN THEY DON'T GET THE TYPE OF SERVICES. MAYBE THEY NEED THROUGH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THEY WOULD. THEN RETRIEVE THOSE SERVICES FROM THE MEDICAL SYSTEM OR SOME OTHER PUBLIC SYSTEM IS THAT IT IS A THAT DOES HAPPEN NOW DOES HAPPEN NOW YES OKAY YEAH SO THAT'S A COST TO THE STATE AND EARLY IT IS THE CAR THROUGH THE MEDICAID SYSTEM FOR US YES THE ONE THING TO JUST CLARIFY THERE REALLY ARE THREE SYSTEMS THURS WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE COMMERCIAL AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT PLANS EMPLOYERS MAY GO FOR. THEN YOU HAVE THE MANAGED CARE MEDI CAL WHICH IS BEEN GIVEN OVER THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES WANT ONE MORE SYSTEM X. ABOUT LOW RATES AND YOU SAY MANAGED CARE YOU MEAN THOUGH LIKE THE COUNTY POWER MANAGE CARE THE IT'S THE IT'S THE A MILD TO MODERATE- YOUTH WHO ARE. QUOTE MILD AMOUNT. INTERNALS OF FOR MEDI. AND THE U. COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE A LOT OF THOSE PLANS THAT'S UNDER THE MANAGER ON TRUCKS WITH THE RIGHT. WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED CARE PARTNER OF HEALTH CARE RATHER AND THEN THEIR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH OF THE COUNTY'S HANDLE IT STAB SYSTEM THAT BREAKDOWN IS HANDLE. THAT HAS THE LARGER WAS A TERROR ATTACK. OKAY TWELVE YEARS OF. HOW ABOUT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS THE PART OF THE MEDIC YOU CONSIDER THAT PART OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM RIGHT YES OKAY- DO DO YOU FEEL THAT- FINANCIALLY. AS WE HAVE THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT. WE'RE CATCHING PEOPLE TO LAY THE YOUNG KIDS TOO LATE RIGHT DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND WHAT CAN YOU KIND OF TALK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU OPERATE- I CAN GIVE A AN EXAMPLE REAL QUICKLY- IN ADDITION TO JUST THE SUFFERING WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COST OF HOSPITALIZATION. TWO THREE DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION OVER HOSPITALIZATION EPISODES IMPATIENT OF EPISODE MAYBE EQUIVALENT TO MAYBE FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO A FULL MONTH OF INTENSIVE IN HOME THERAPY SERVICES SO WHEN YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS. ARE IN INPATIENT UNITS ARE TELLING US OTHER FULL THERE'S A LOT OF RECIDIVISM BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING IN BEING ABLE TO PLACE YOU WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE SO AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY'RE COMING BACK AND GETTING SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT- GUN CLOSELY TYPES OF TREATMENTS WHAT'S HAPPENING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I ADDRESS BEFORE IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND VERY VERY COSTLY. HE WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND THIS CONTINUUM AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SCARE NOT ONLY IT WILL BE BETTER FOR THE FAMILY FOR THE YOUTH BUT HE WILL ALSO BRING SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS WHICH IS A LOT OF THE MOTIVATION. BELIEVE US TO US WE'RE ALSO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE AREA BECAUSE THERE IS A SENSE OF THIS COULD BE VERY COST EFFECTIVE. THE RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE MIDDLE HEALTH SYSTEM. I MIGHT. IS OR IS NOT TOWARDS. KIDS IS MORE OR AND TOWARDS ADULTS WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT YES OKAY SO- THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS ORIENTED TOWARDS. WAITING UNTIL THEY BECOME ADULTS IF YOU WANT TO SET THAT WAY AND THEN. PROVIDING THROUGH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. MEDI CAL OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES- AND MAYBE THROUGH THE ADULT INSURANCE PROCESS OTHER KINDS OF SERVERS WE DON'T CATCH THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL OR OR- BECAUSE OF THIS THE ISSUES WE HAVE THE PREVIOUS PANEL STIGMA ALL THOSE KINDS OF. THE ROOM THE RACIAL OF DISPARITIES SO- ETHNIC DISPARITIES ISSUE ALL THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES. WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF WE TOOK MORE A OF OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND MAYBE RE RE RE INVIGORATED THE CHILDREN'S PART OF IT HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT. A INTERFERE A FULL OF THINGS AND I'M SURE THAT STEVE HAS SOME IDEAS AS WELL YEAH- FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE MORE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH ATTEMPTING TO BE VERY KLEIN TO INDIVIDUAL CENTER WHICH IS THE ADULT MODEL SYMPTOM REDUCTION ALSO THE OF THE OLD MODEL. CHILDREN LEAVING FAMILIES FOR HOPEFULLY THE BELIEVE IT IN IN FAMILIES IT HAS TO BE A FAMILY CENTRED APPROACH SO WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT TENDS TO HAPPEN I THINK THE SOMETIMES THE BENEFITS ARE CONCEIVED- AND THEN WE PROVIDERS NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THEM. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE IF WE COULD LOOK AT MODELS THAT REALLY ALLOWS TO EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR THE YOUTH AND THE FAMILIES AND THEN IDENTIFY HOW TO TAKE THE BENEFITS AND BE ABLE TO REALLY HELP SUPPORT THAT. TO BE ABLE TO- MAKE IT COST EFFECTIVE THAT COULD GO A LONG WAY BUT WE WOULD SAY THAT FAMILIES CENTER IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT INTEGRATION THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WERE FINING WITH PRIMARY CARE IN PEDIATRIC OFFICES IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THE OTHER COMPONENT IS. OF COURSE WITH SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THAT SO THAT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS TOGETHER PROBABLY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. YOU KNOW ONE THE THINGS THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME HIS LOOK AT THE DATA. THE REDUCTION OF USE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IT'S BEEN A HUGE ARE HUGE DECLINE AM VERY PURPOSEFUL !S OF OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT. THAT SYSTEM IS PROVIDING BUT IF YOU TALK TO THE CHAU OFFER FOLKS. THEY WILL SAY YEAH NOW A LOT OF THOSE KIDS ARE WINDING UP IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THAT'S ALSO DECLINING THEY'VE HAD SOME REAL GOOD SUCCESS WITH COMMUNITY SERVICES FAMILY SUPPORTS. JUDY CATION TYPE SERVICES THAT THEY DELIVER AND SO THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR THEIR POPULATION THEN YOU TALK TO THE EDUCATORS AND SAY YEAH WE HAVE ALL THOSE KIDS. AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE- WHAT KIDS GO THROUGH NOW IN SCHOOLS THEY GO TO SCHOOLS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS. AND NOW THAT IT IS A LITTLE. I THINK IT CREATES SOME OF THOSE. ONLY THAT'S NOT ADVISABLE WELL I THINK IT DOES CREATE SOME REAL STRESS ANXIETY ON THE PART OF THESE KIDS IT'S A TRAUMATIC EVENT IN AND OF ITSELF JUST THE REHEARSALS AND- DESCRIPTION. DESCRIPTIONS THAT THEY GET ON WHY THEY'RE DOING THAT- SO SCHOOL SERVICES WHICH MORE CSUS MENTION IN TERMS OF EXPANDING THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO KIDS SCHOOLS ARE REALLY AN IMPORTANT. SPOT WHICH SHOW WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF OUR PANELISTS AT THAT'S WHERE- MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE DELIVERED. YEAH I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND MAYBE CENTER MAROC BUT- IF WE- REINVIGORATED THE USE THE MENTAL HEALTH. SYSTEM WOULD WE RECEIVED AS A STATE I'M TALKING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT. RECOMMEND VETOES IN BUDGET CUTS FOR. ALL THE BILLS THAT WE PROPOSE FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS OVER THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE A LIST OF IF WE REINVIGORATE. THE USE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WOULD RE RECEIVE DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF LESS FOSTER KIDS JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM- BETTER EDUCATION- RESULTS- BETTER ECONOMIC FUTURES. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE. THE SIDE OF THE BENEFITS OF CATCHING EARLIER AT THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS. OUT THERE IS NOT REALLY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND YOU CAN YOU MENTION A NUMBER OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS- THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT THE THAT SHOW ON. I HOPE THAT I CAN PUT IT CORRECTLY THAT SOMETIMES A ONE DOLLAR. INVESTED IN EARLY THAT IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION CAN SAVE FIVE TO SEVEN. LATER ON SO IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO REALLY I IDENTIFIED THAT THE BENEFITS OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS AND IDENTIFY THE 50% OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT ADULTS WITH HAPPY FOR THE AGE OF FOURTEEN. IF WE COULD DO THAT AND INTERVENE EARLIER BEFORE THEY BECOME CHRONIC CONDITIONS OF BEFORE THE BECOME MORE ACUTE CONDITIONS WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET BETTER RESULTS I NEED SOME HE WILL BE OF A WISE INVESTMENT. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IT WOULD THERE BE A MULTIPLIER EFFECT FOR. LATINO AND NON. AFTER AMERICAN OF. FAMILIES A IN THAT IN THAT REGARD WITH THE BE A MULTIPLIER EFFECT IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THEY HAVE LESS WE SAW THE DATA EARLIER THEY HAVE FAR LESS SERVICES WHAT WHAT SPECIALLY FOR KIDS BUT WE'RE IDENTIFYING IS THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASONS WHY A FAMILY CENTER APPROACH IS IMPORTANT. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE DATE THE CULTURAL AWARENESS OF WHAT REALLY- RESONATES AND WHAT DO YOU REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO STOP THEIR SOME CREDIBILITY BUT IF YOU WORKING WITH THE FAMILY HAVING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THE IMPACTS ARE COULD BE VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT AND BENEFICIAL AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING THAT HAPPENING IN THE WORK THAT WE DO HAVE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE. SOME OF OUR PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S OF IT THE IS NOT SOME MENTAL HEALTH WHERE. IT THAT NEEDS BIG IN FOR. OF RESOURCES. BUT IT'S ALSO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THOSE ARE MUCH BIGGER POLICY ISSUES I THINK THAT. COULD AB AVERAGE FUTURE IMPACT ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW OKAY CENTER OKAY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT YOUR SERVICE- WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR ANY IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS GOING TO SEE CHAU HANDS ANYBODY OKAY PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE ALL ALLOW- OF SOME TESTIMONY HERE. IF YOU COULD LIVE YOUR REMARKS. THAT WOULD BE PER FOR OF ALL GO AHEAD PLEASE I THANK YOU SENATOR PELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. MY NAME IS PAM HAWKINS AND I AM WITH AN AGENCY CALLED UNITED PARENTS WE ARE MADE UP OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE NEEDS SO WE ADVOCATE ACROSS THE STATE FOR THOSE FAMILIES. I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT- WE- ARE. BIG ADVOCATES FOR THERAPIES THAT INCLUDE FAMILIES AND THERE ARE SEVERAL. EFFECTIVE PRACTICES WHEN I SIT BACK TO PRACTICES WHAT I REALLY MEAN AS AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. A PRACTICE THAT HAS A RESEARCH AND A BASIS TO LET US KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK. SO WE ARE ADVOCATES OF AFFECTED PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY FAMILY THERAPY IS. WE TALK ABOUT FAMILY THERAPIES AND- YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE THOSE IN EITHER THE MEDICAL SYSTEM FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE REASON FOR THIS I THINK IS THAT HIS FAMILY THERAPIES AND THERE ARE- SEVERAL FAMILY THERAPY SO I'LL MENTION ONE IT'S CALLED FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY IT HAS FOR DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE WITH. OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE ONLY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM SO YOU SEE POSITIVE RESULTS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD BUT- THERAPIST WHEN THEY'RE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL ARE NOT TAUGHT TO DO FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY SO IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE PROVIDER OF SERVICE WHAT CASA PACIFICA OR SAN DIEGO CENTER FOR CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE TO PAY FOR THE TRAINING FOR THEIR CLINICIANS- TO. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IT'S EXPENSIVE AND ONGOING TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- MODEL THAT'S FAMILIES RECEIVED AS A MODEL IT HERE HUESO THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT WAS INTENDED TO DO SO THAT YOU GET THE AFFECT ABOUT COM OR THE POSITIVE OUTCOME. SO I THINK THAT I JUST WANTED AT HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT. A VERY SMALL PER OF CHILDREN CAL ACTUALLY RECEIVED A FOR. AN AFFECTED FAMILY THERAPY. SO SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT THANK YOU. YES PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- THERE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CAME UP FOR ME AS I WAS LISTENING AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF YES MY NAME IS TANYA MCCOLLUM AND I LIVE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY OKAY AND- I AM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS ABOUT DISPARITIES AND SERVICES. AND AS A PARENT OF A YOUNG BLACK MAN YOUNG BOY WHO WAS IN SCHOOL I A CAN SPEAK TO THAT BEING A STATISTIC IN TERMS OF THE- BOYS OF COLOR BEING SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR COUNTER THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. FOR SOME OF THE SAME OFFENSES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE IN HELPING THAT IS REALLY A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION- MODEL IS ALSO EVIDENCE BASED. AND IT'S CALLED MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY DONE AT THE PRESCHOOL LEVEL BECAUSE THE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION RATES START THAT EARLY. AND IT ADDRESSES THE SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO- NECESSARILY PUTTING CHILDREN SERVICES. EIGHT THERAPISTS OUR CLINICIANS ARE BROUGHT INTO THE- A SCHOOL SETTING BUT THERE'D BE HEADS PROGRAMS OR HATEVER. TO EDUCATE THE PROVIDERS TO PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ON BEHAVIORS THAT THEY MAY BE SEEING IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM SETTING. SO IT REALLY THE IN THE ADDRESS IS THE SYSTEM WHICH I THINK IS REALLY WHAT WILL HELP TO DEAL WITH DISPARITIES IN THAT WAY. AND WHAT I'M NOTICING IS THAT WITH THE MANAGED CARE MODEL THAT THAT PART OF THIS OF INTERVENTION IS BEING CUT. BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF A- EMPHASIS AT CONDITIONS BEING ABLE TO BUILD A MAN AND- MIL HEALTH CONSULTATION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S MEDI CAL BILLABLE. SOUL I WOULD. LIKE TO SEE THAT THAT BE ADDRESS THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE IT'S A VERY VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE. AT AND IT DOES HELP IN AND KEEPING KIDS IN SCHOOL AND ALSO IDENTIFYING THEM IF THEY DO NEED SERVICES. THANK YOU LOVE TO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IF YOU GET OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU. NEXT WEEK REPLACE. HI MY NAME IS BURKE RADIUM THE DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEM- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS- A SILLY QUESTION BUT I THINK YOU SAID THAT 98% OF LEGISLATIVE FUNDING IS DENIED AT THE BUDGET LEVEL IS AND WHAT WHAT I SAID WAS SO WITH WE DID A STUDY OF- LIKE THE BILLS THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. AND IN TERMS OF THE ROOM YOU KNOW THE IN A TO GET A BILL THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT. SURE ESPECIALLY ONE I DO. CENTER MORAL ARE CAN SAY IT'S EVEN WORSE FOR RIGHT. FOR BUT YOU GOT TO BE YOU GO IT YOU CAN GOT A REAL THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A LOT BARRIERS AND ONE OF IS THE FINANCE. AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY THEY LIKE TO SAY NO. AND THEY SAY NO 90% OF TIME FOR MENTAL HEALTH BILLS I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DON'T SAY. THEY DON'T SEE IS THE WAY THEY LOOK AT THINGS IS MAYBE A LITTLE WRONG. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING IN TERMS OF SAVING. THE TAXPAYER AND THE COMMUNITY MONEY. IN TERMS OF FEEL A FORGET ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE SERVICE BUT LOOKING AT THINGS IN TERMS OF. DOES THIS HAVE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT. FISCALLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WELL IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HEARS SAYING IF YOU DO STUFF. WITH THE KID EARLIER IN ALL AT THE KID WAIT UNTIL THE KID GETS WORSE AND WORSE THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THING SHE CAN POSSIBLY DO THE- LONG TERM LIFE FOR THAT CHILD. ESPECIALLY WITH. THE DISPARITIES NUMBERS FOR A SUIT WHY I KEEP BRINGING THAT UP. FOR THE LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS IT'S JUST SO OBVIOUS IT'S LIKE AN OBVIOUS THING I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY AND THEN AND THEN BROUGHT UP THE POINTS ABOUT HOSPITALIZATION. WAS ACOSTA PUT ONE PERSON A. A THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK IN OUR AREA IN THE BAY AREA PROBABLY I WOULD SAY THAT. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHEN TALKING ABOUT A WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN CHANGE THAT IS IT MORE DATA THAT'S NEEDED ON IT MEANS THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY THINK AND THEY CAN HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WHO THEIR BOSS. IS UP THEREYOU KNOW OVER DOWN ON THE FIRST FLOOR. BECAUSE TONE TO. CHANGE THE WAY THEY'RE DOING THINGS THERE MAYBE BUT THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY IT. YOU HAVE A NAME A SHEKEL LOBBY IS SERVICE NEWSOME NEWSOME. HAS SAID GO TALK TO THE- EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. IF YOU KNOW IT BUT HE'S BUT HE'S EXPLORING. AS THE OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY SAID HE'S EXPLORING ALL THIS ISSUE IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HE LIKES TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF A STRATEGY. IS THE FIRST GOVERNOR MY OPINION FOR GOVERNORS AND ON BY BEFORE WE HAD SOMEBODY TALK THIS MUCH ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IS GOVERNOR'S SOME. TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT THAT'S TRUE OKAY. SO I'M REALLY PLEASED AND I JUST THINK THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT THE- INSTITUTION HOW YOU HAVE TO. CHANGE SERVE THE INGRAINED. WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS AND MAKE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR OUR STATE. THAT'S ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH I'M SORRY I WENT ON AND ON BUT I HAVE STRONG OPINIONS. OKAY GO AHEAD HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER SAID BRANSTETTER I'M NOT HERE ON BEHALF OF ANYONE OTHER THAN MYSELF BUT I WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATOR FOR SIX YEARS NAME A CURRENT NURSE HERE UC DAVIS AND THEN I DO SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSING. FOR THE COUNTY OF SA JOAQUIN SO I'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS- MY QUESTION FOR USE IN MEDICINE THERE'S A TREND WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM CULTURAL COMPETENCY TO MORE OF A CULTURAL HUMILITY APPROACH. WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES TO HELP DIRECT HOW WE BEST. A PUT MONEY BACK INTO THAT COMMUNITY FOR EFFECTIVE RESULTS. IN MENTAL HEALTH AND THINGS LIKE THAT HOW ARE WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY- GOING TO ENSURE THAT WERE REALLY GETTING COMMUNITY DRIVEN. INITIATIVES AND SUPPORTING THOSE AS OPPOSED TO KIND OF TOP DOWN MAYBE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY PROJECTS. WELL IN THE REGULAR GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY FOR GOING TO BE FAMILY ORIENTED. SO WE HOW EVERYBODY'S EVERY AREA HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF DYNAMICS. IT TAKES A LOT OF INPUT AND DISCUSSION. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I HOPE THAT THIS. NEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE. THAT WERE STARTED WILL DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH. IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF LISTENING. TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WORK IN CERTAIN AREAS AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S- PROBABLY TRUE WITH THE BIG STATE LIKE WE HAVE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE. WHAT WORKS IN SAN JOSE WHERE I'M FROM MY NOT WORK AND- STOCKTON IT'LL- ABSENT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT NO. SO I THINK YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT THAT'S MY OPINION OKAY IS THERE ANY STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO HELP FACILITATE THAT OR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REMEMBER WE HAVEN'T GOT THE WORD ABOUT THIS SCHEDULE THE SURGERY UNDERSECRETARY WILL. THERE'S JUST GETTING ORGANIZED RIGHT. THIS SO WE NEED A KIND OF HAVE A THIS KIND OF LISTENING KIND OF ACTIVITY. IN ALL DIFFERENT ART PARTS OF THE STATE BASICALLY. WHICH I HOPE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME. THIRTY ONE A REPRESENT CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSE ARE YOU TODAY- I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY HALF OF ALL KIDS ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE. WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTS ARE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. SIX MILLION CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOLS TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SCHOOLS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE. WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE FACT THAT THERE IS A VERY RICH BENEFIT PACKAGE UNDER THE PST T. OUR THAT WOULD LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY LOOK AT PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES. IN THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE A VERY LOW RATIOS OF CREDENTIAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT WILL BE YOUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS AS MENTIONED BY SENATOR- RUBIO. YOUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST YOUR SOCIAL WORKERS YOU SCHOOL NURSES ALL OF WHOM CAN PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE ALSO HAVE A FUNDING A PROCESS ELLIE A MARK. WHICH ON AT THIS PRESENT TIME ONLY COVERS KIDS WHO HAVE I. E. PEACE BUT- ONCE WE GET THE SPA APPROVED BY STATE PLAN AMENDMENT PROVED BY A CMS. ALL MEDI CAL CHILDREN IF WE'RE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THEM IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY PHYSICAL MENTAL WE CAN CLAIM REIMBURSEMENT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS OUT THERE TO LOOK AT. PROVIDING PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR THESE CHILDREN. THANK YOU I THINK THE SCHOOLS NEED TO APPROACH THAT MULTIPLE- FUNDING FOR- SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OF WHEN I WAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE STARTED A OF PROGRAM FOR THAT. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY- USING. THE Mà FUNDS MEDICAID MINISTRY TO MEDICAID MINISTRY PROGRAM. AND WE FUNDED A LOT OF THE SCHOOL NURSES AND- STAFF IN THE VARIOUS. L. JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN- IN OUR COUNTY. AND I THINK- SUCH A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S SORT OF. COLLABORATION OF FUNDING- IS HAS TO BE REINVIGORATED IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO READ TO RE CREATE THE OUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE STARTED OUT THE- COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY- RETICENT RELUCTANT. FOR IN SOME CASES JUST NOT WANT TO- PARTNER WITH THE SCHOOLS AROUND HEALTHCARE ISSUES AND NOT JUST MENTAL HEALTH THANK YOU- PRIMARILY MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO WE- HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO THE HEALTH PLANS AND THEY PLAY OBVIOUSLY A LARGE ROLE IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW COVERING THE BED THE BENEFIT PACKAGE IN A AND ALSO THE FUNDING. SO ARE THERE STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. ONE LAST THING. WITH THE HEALTHY ARE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO REDO REORGANIZE MEDI CAL BUT THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ONLY A Mà PROGRAM AND SO WE ARE STILL TRYING TO MEET WITH THEM TO BRING THAT TO ATTENTION BECAUSE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU OF WELL. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT I THINK THIS IS OUR FIRST- SELECT COMMITTEE ON ON- MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE STATE SENATE OF THIS IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IT RELATES TO A LOT OF- THINGS WERE WORKING ON A LOT OF THINGS THE GOVERNOR HAD IN THIS BUDGET. AND WE'RE REAL EXCITED THAT WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW. SO WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE INPUT FROM ALL OF YOU. AND HOPEFULLY PRODUCE- SO EXCITING LEGISLATION AND- BUDGET PROPOSAL SO SURE- WITH THE REFORMS THAT WERE NOW UNDERGOING WITH OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM. IN OUR PRIVATE INSURANCE PROGRAM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THIS METING IS ADJOURNED.
