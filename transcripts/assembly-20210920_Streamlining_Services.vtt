AFFECTED BY THIS ABUSE AND

00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:55.959
THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN

PEERS OF OTHER RACES. WOMEN WHO

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.312
SIMILARLY VULNERABLE TO

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:17.414
INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND

NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.228
DIFFICULT FOR MANY VICTIMS AND

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.363

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.833
ABUSE TO ACCESS LIFE SAVING

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:38.402
RESOURCES. THE FEAR OF CATCHING

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.070
CALL THE NINETEEN HAS PREVENTED

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.371
SOME VICTIMS FROM SEEKING

EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:45.342
HOSPITAL. AND WHILE MANY HEALTH

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:59.289
TO SPEAK WITH THEIR DOCTORS OR

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:00.724
THERAPISTS. ACCESSING HELP IS

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:03.193
DIFFICULT WHEN ABUSERS ALSO

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.428
ISOLATE THEIR PARTNERS FROM

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:07.264
SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS ABUSERS

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:09.266

OUR PARTNER FROM REACHING THE

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:22.779
FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO TO

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:24.848
WORK OR TO SCHOOL. PLACES WHERE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.350
THEY COULD RECEIVE HELP FROM

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:27.918
FROM THEIR FRIENDS OR CO

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:30.287

ACCESSING FUNDS IN A SHARED

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:45.135
COMMON AMONG ABUSERS ONE STUDY

SURVIVORS IN THE SAMPLE

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.243
EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.212
ECONOMIC ABUSE DURING THE

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:57.548

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.660
BACK TO ABUSER BECAUSE THEY

AFFORD TO STAY AWAY. NOW MORE

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:12.829

VIOLENCE AT THE TIME OF CODED.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:29.926
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:31.294
BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT IS VERY

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.330
VERY HIDDEN PERVASIVE

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.599
EXPLOITATION OF INDIVIDUALS. ON

A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:50.881
ON FAMILIES. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.716
THAT SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.451
OTHERWISE BE AN ABUSER HAS

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.586
BECOME AN ABUSER GIVEN THE

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:57.187
STRESSORS THAT EXISTS IN OUR

00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:00.190
SOCIETY. UNEMPLOYMENT OF LACK

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:02.092
OF RESOURCES BEING CONFINED IN

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:04.761
THE HOME. AND I AND SO THERE

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.062
ARE FAMILIES THAT WERE REALLY

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:08.532
ILL EQUIPPED. A BECAUSE THERE

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.166
HAS NOT BEEN A HISTORY OF

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:12.436
VIOLENCE. WE ALSO SEE THAT-

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:14.004
THAT WITH THE SHELTER IN PLACE

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.305
THAT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE A

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:16.973
VIOLENT TENDENCY OR HAVE BEEN

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.675
VIOLENT PAST. HAVE ONLY

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:21.278
ESCALATED AND NOT ONLY AGAINST

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:23.980
THE ADULT VICTIM THEIR PARTNER

BUT ALSO AGAINST CHILDREN. AND

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:27.050
ONE OF THE STATE ONE OF THE

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.785
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOTICED IS

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.387
THAT WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:31.788
COOPER. REFERENCE IN THAT IS

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.657
THAT AN ABUSER GETS ARRESTED

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:34.658
THEY'RE BROUGHT TO JAIL THEY'RE

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:35.292
BOOKED AND THEN THEY'RE

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:37.027
RELEASED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:37.994
UNDER THE EMERGENCY BELL

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:40.163
SCHEDULE WITHOUT EVEN TIME FOR

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.432
THE VICTIM TO FIND. TO TRY TO

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:45.068
SEEK RESOURCES TO GET AWAY FROM

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:45.635
THAT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:48.405
HOUSE. BUT MANY OF THE WE ALSO

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.407
FOUND DO TO COPE IS THAT

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:51.408
VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:53.543
VIOLENCE. HAD NO ACCESS TO

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:54.945
HOSPITALS THEY COULD GO TO THE

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:56.179
HOSPITAL BUT THERE WAS NO THERE

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.781
WERE NO ADVOCATE RESOURCES

00:51:57.848 --> 00:51:59.216
THERE. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.317
ALLOWING OTHER PEOPLE INTO THE

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:02.452
HOSPITAL. AND FOR MANY THE

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.186
HOSPITAL WAS NOT EVEN A SAFE

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.855
PLACE BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.490
DEALING WITH COBIT. AND SO

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:07.757
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:09.526
HAVING AT LEAST A MANDATORY

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:11.328
REPORT. MADE TO THE POLICE SO

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.762
THERE COULD BE SOME FOLLOW UP.

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.030
A LOT OF THAT WAS DROPPING OFF

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:17.234
THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE OF THE-

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.835
CONDITIONS THAT CODE HAD. MANY

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:19.736
OF THE SERVICES AS YOU

MEDICAL SERVICES BECAME REMOTE.

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.977
WHICH IS. CAN BE EFFECTIVE

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.745
AFTER BUT NOT FOR THE

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.514
IMMEDIATE. INTERVENTION

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.550
SHELTERS ALSO HAD TREMENDOUS-

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:35.252
CHALLENGES THIS YEAR BECAUSE IF

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.153
A SHELTER HAD A POSITIVE COBIT

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.989
TEST THEY HAD TO CLEAR OUT THE

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:41.291
SHELTERS SO I KNOW IN MY COUNTY

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.260
THEY PURCHASE HOTELS. AND WE'RE

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.728
READ THE OUR SHELTER PARTNERS

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.763
WERE USING HOTELS TO BE ABLE TO

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.098
HOUSE PEOPLE BUT IT WAS NOT

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:50.634
OPTIMAL FOR SURE- AND PEOPLE

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.569
WERE TO ME IN HOTEL ROOMS DON'T

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:53.570
HAVE IN MOTEL ROOMS DON'T HAVE

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.171
KITCHENS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:56.840
WAY TO GET HEALTHY EATING IF OR

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.875
EVEN. BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:01.478
OF KIDS I PERSONALLY SAW WOMEN

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:03.013
WHO WERE LIVING IN CARS WITH

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:04.748
THEIR CHILDREN WHO FLED THEIR

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.316
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I KNOW HERE

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.118
WITH US TODAY AND THE AUDIENCE

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:09.486
IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MY

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:11.087
FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER SABRINA

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:12.522
FERAL. AND THERE'S SO MANY

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.324
WOMEN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.493
OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE THEIR

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.427
ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO LIVE IN

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:20.430
THE CAR THAT HAD TO BE AWAY

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.098
FROM THE VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT.

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:23.700
BUT IN L. AS GOING ALONG WITH

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:24.868
THAT THERE'S IT AS IT WAS

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.770
POINTED OUT BY MR NOT AT THAT

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:28.672
THE LACK OF HOUSING. OF

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.440
AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.175
EMERGENCY HOUSING POSE GREAT

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:34.144
CHALLENGES FOR US. ESPECIALLY

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.879
WHAT WE SEE WHICH IS. BEEN

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.948
EXACERBATED THROUGH COVERED IS

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:39.616
THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE PETS.

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:40.917
WHAT I OFTENTIMES NOT LEAVE

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:41.818
UNLESS THEY COULD BRING THEIR

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.253
PET WITH THEM. BECAUSE THEY

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.888
KNEW THAT IF THEY LEFT THE PET

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:46.056
BACK THE PET WAS LIKELY TO BE

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:49.993
KILLED. OR ABUSED ITSELF.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.795
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.730
POPULATIONS HAVE BECOME VERY

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:56.299
MUCH MORE VULNERABLE- BECAUSE

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.468
AGAIN EVERYBODY WAS SHELTERED

00:53:58.535 --> 00:53:59.469
IN HOME AND THEY WERE SHELTERED

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:01.071
IN HOME WITH WITH ABUSIVE

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:06.009
PEOPLE. SO THE A LOT OF THE

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.644
PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED TO

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.546
PROVIDE THE SERVICES ALSO HAD

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:10.981
TO GO REMOTE I KNOW IT OUR

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.649
FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER MANY OF

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:15.018
OUR PARTNERS WORK OFF SITE- WE

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.053
DID WHEN CO WITH FIRST HIT IS

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.421
THAT WE CLOSED DOWN FOR THREE

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:19.756
DAYS TO DO A DEEP CLEAN OF THE

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:22.292
AND- TIRE FACILITY- BUT  LOT

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.693
OF THOSE. A LOT OF THE SERVICES

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.261
ARE BEING DONE REMOTELY WHICH

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.230
IS NOT THE SAME ESPECIALLY IN

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:29.499
THAT CRITICAL TWENTY FOUR FORTY

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:30.734
EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE VICTIM

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.769
SURVIVORS COME FORWARD TO TALK

00:54:32.836 --> 00:54:34.137
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER.

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:37.474
OR HIM IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.541
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE WAS

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:39.576
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.678
THERE WERE NO OPTIONS AND SO

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:44.414
WHAT WE STARTED TO DO WAS TO

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:45.715
CREATE POSTERS WORK WITH THE

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:46.883
GROCERS ASSOCIATION IN

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.019
CALIFORNIA. AND ALLOWED US TO

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:50.387
GIVE THEM POSTERS FOR EACH

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.622
COUNTY WITH RESOURCE NUMBERS

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.189
THEY WERE IN ALL THE GROCERY

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.958
STORE SO SOMEBODY EITHER A

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.093
PERSON WHO IS BEING ABUSED OR

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.662
SOMEONE WHO KNEW A PERSON BEING

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:00.230
ABUSE COULD NO HELP WAS OUT

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.931
THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.266
LACK OF COMMUNICATION DURING

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.701
COVERT EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.436
COBIT. AND EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:07.937
STAY HOME AND WE WANTED TO MAKE

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:09.873
SURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:12.742
KNOW THAT THERE'S THERE WAS

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:16.513
HELP AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE- A

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:17.881
CENTURY PEOPLE BECAME PRISONERS

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.616
IN THEIR OWN HOME AND IT WAS

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.317
GREAT BIG CHALLENGES FOR THEM

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:26.322
BEING ABLE TO SEEK HELP. THE.

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:27.657
SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS I

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.993
SAID IS THAT WE CREATED OUR

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.127
STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:32.996
WERE BEING NOT JUST STRATEGIC

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.898
BUT COMPREHENSIVE SO OUR FIRST

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:36.633
STRATEGY WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.501
LET PEOPLE KNOW THERE WAS HELP

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:39.803
AND THAT THERE WAS A WAY TO GET

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.237
AWAY FROM THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:43.506
VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT. WE TRIED

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:46.142
TO ENGAGE YOUTH ALSO WE WORKED

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:47.510
WITH COMCAST TO BECAME A GREAT

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.578
PARTNER FOR US TO PUT

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:50.914
COMMERCIALS AND PSAS ON WE

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.582
WORKED WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA WE

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:54.317
WORK WITH RADIO STATIONS WE

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:56.086
JUST GOT THE WORD OUT THAT HELP

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:58.254
WAS AVAILABLE. AND WHAT WE SAW

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.023
WAS THAT PEOPLE STARTED COMING

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.558
TO THE JUSTICE CENTER. NOW OF

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:03.460
COURSE WE ARE VERY CAREFUL ALSO

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.462
BECAUSE WE HAD STAFF ON SITE.

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.697
SO WE HAD BIG BIG BASKETS OF

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:09.032
MASKS AND HAND SANITIZER

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:12.001
EVERYWHERE. GLASS PUT UPPER

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:14.771
FOUNDED THE BARRIERS SO THAT WE

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:15.839
COULD ACTUALLY SEE PEOPLE

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:17.207
ADDITIONALLY AND THEN

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.541
EVENTUALLY WE COULD TRANSITION

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:21.311
THEM TO BEING HELPED REMOTELY.

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.813
OF THE COUNT THE KEY WAS TO LET

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.681
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE WAS HELP

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.850
SO. WE WORKED AT THE GROCERY

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.118
STORES WHAT WE REALIZED WAS

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:30.620
THAT WE HAD A LOT OF OUR OF THE

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.155
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ALSO

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.356
SERVICING BEING SERVICED BY THE

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.325
FOOD BANK. SO WE TOOK THOSE BIG

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.659
POSTERS AND MADE HIM SMALL AND

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.895
WE PUT HIM IN EVERY SIX EVERY

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:40.964
SINGLE FOOD BANK BAG. AND

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.765
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE REALLY

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.166
STARTED TO SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.968
TAKING THE HAVING THE COURAGE

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.870
TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL. OR TO

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:49.639
COME AND SEE US- IT WAS ALSO

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.376
HAPPENING IN- IN FAMILIES THAT

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:54.611
WE STARTED SEEING AN INCREASE

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.312
BOTH IN THE INTENSITY OF THE

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:58.181
VIOLENCE MUCH MORE INTENSE

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.316
INJURY HOSPITALS ARE CALLING US

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.685
AT THE JUSTICE CENTER ASKING US

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.721
TO HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE HELP-

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:05.822
THAT WE SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.124
REPORTING A STRONGER AND MORE

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:11.761
SEVERE INJURIES. AND WE SAW WE

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.329
REMINDED OURSELVES THAT PEOPLE

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.098
WHO HAVE MEANS HAD THE ABILITY

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:17.033
TO LEAVE IF THEY COULD

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.135
PSYCHOLOGICALLY BUT THEY HAD

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.204
THE ABILITY TO GO TO A HOTEL OR

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:23.206
GO STAY WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS-

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.375
WE WERE REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:25.942
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THAT

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:28.945
OPTION. WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.847
OUR PSAS AND ARE OUT REACHES WE

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.882
TALK TO CHILDREN. WE TALK TO

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.918
CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.252
AND HOW THEY COULD THAT TELL

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.187
SOMEONE IF SOMETHING WAS

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:38.621
SOMEBODY WAS HURTING HIM I KNOW

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.557
HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE SCHOOL

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:42.392
DISTRICT HAD BANNERS ON THE

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.194
SCREEN FOR THE KIDS THEY WERE

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.728
THEY WERE IN SCHOOL REMOTELY

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:46.930
SAYING. IF SOMEONE'S HURTING

00:57:46.996 --> 00:57:49.399
YOU YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE YOU

00:57:49.465 --> 00:57:52.202
CAN CALL THE NUMBER. THE AND

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.403
THEN WE WORK WITH TEACHERS WHO

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:54.904
ARE ONLINE WITH THE KIDS TO

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:55.872
THAT THEY COULD PAY ATTENTION

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:57.740
IF THEY WERE SAYING SOMETHING

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.043
THAT WAS OUT OF. OUT OF SORTS.

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:01.110
AS I SAID BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:03.079
SHELTER BECAUSE OF A CODE IN

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.547
THE SHELTERS THAT WE HAD TO DO

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:06.349
WE STARTED USING HOTEL ROOMS.

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:07.750
AND WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.485
PURCHASING A NINETY ROOM HOTEL

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:10.920
THAT WOULD HAD SIX FLOORS THAT

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:13.323
WE WERE GOING TO CONVERT INTO.

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.992
A SAFE AND- HOW SAFE HOUSING

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.961
FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN- BUT

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:19.762
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. BUT SO

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.564
FAR SINCE KOBE TO SAP HAS

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:23.566
STARTED IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE-

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.501
HOUSED OVER SIX HUNDRED WOMEN.

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.437
BOTH THROUGH EMERGENCY HOUSING.

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:28.905
SOME HAVING TO GOING TO HOTEL

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:31.107
ROOMS WE'VE HAD TO PIVOT. TO

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.109
HAVE FOOD ON SITE TO GIVE THEM

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.978
FOOD THAT CAN BE COOKED IN A

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.913
MICROWAVE. BECAUSE AGAIN WE

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.381
ASSUME HERE YOU'RE SAFE IN THE

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:39.749
ROOM. BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:41.384
EAT. AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.052
FEED YOUR CHILDREN. SO WE BUY%

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:45.088
FOOD AND OUR FOOD BANK TO TRY

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:45.855
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:47.557
FOOD THAT'S EXCEPT THAT IT. IS

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:50.126
ACCEPTABLE FOR. DURING HOTEL

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.295
ROOMS. THE BUT WE ALSO HAD TO

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:54.597
WE ALSO HAVE A STRATEGY OF

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:55.531
MOVING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.934
HOME BASE. IN SO THEY'LL BE OUT

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.402
IN THE EAST PART OF OUR COUNTY

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.037
AS OPPOSED TO NORTH PART OF THE

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:04.173
COUNTY AND VICE VERSA. WE WORK

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.475
WITH PARTNERS THEN TO FIND

00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:06.542
PERMANENT HOUSING AND WE'VE

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:08.645
BEEN A RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.613
FINDING MORE PERMANENT HOUSING.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.416
BUT THE RESOURCES AREN'T THERE

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:14.350
FOR VICTIM SURVIVORS TO SUPPORT

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:16.185
THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S A BIG

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:18.321
THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE IS I LIKE

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:21.124
WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.591
FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.359
COMMISSION TO HAVE A- YOU KNOW

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.427
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIRST

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.262
HOUSING. INITIATIVE SO THAT

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.430
PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE A WAY TO

00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:30.066
GET INTO. LIVING I KNOW THAT

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.634
THROUGH THE VICTIMS OF CRIME.

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.702
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY A

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.103
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RENT FOR

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.438
SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO BE.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.440
EMERGENCY RELOCATED AND WE

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:38.975
UTILIZE ALL OF THOSE SERVICES

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:41.010
FOR VICTIMS- BUT THE KEY IS

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:43.079
MAKING SURE THAT VICTIMS KNOW

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:45.014
THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE. FOR US

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:47.083
AT THE END OF THE DAY. COBIT IS

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.251
GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.352
REALLY GIVE MORE FOCUS TO

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.387
EMPOWERING VICTIMS. BECAUSE WE

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.722
CAN HELP THEM IN A RECENT BY

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.457
RESPONDING WE CAN HELP THEM

WITH INITIAL RESOURCES WE CAN

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.427
DO A LOT OF THAT. BUT OUR GOA

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:59.262
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.597
VICTIM SURVIVOR WALKS AWAY. OF

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:02.165
BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.400
HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN. SO AT

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.435
THE JUSTICE CENTER WE HAVE A

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.103
FOOD HUB WE THOUGHT THAT WE'D

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.238
BE GIVING OUT FOOD AS FOOD AS

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:10.573

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.156
THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:41.424
AREAS WHERE WE'VE JUST REALLY

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.292

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.496
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:48.631
AFTER. THEY GET OUT OF BED THAT

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.833
EXPERIENCE. OUR PROGRAM IS

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.369
CALLED STEP UP. OF WHICH IS

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.338
ABOUT. FINANCIAL LITERACY AND

PROGRAMS. WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.477
WHERE WOMEN ARE LEARNING HOW

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:03.079
TO. TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.181
NEEDS TAKEN. CHANGE ELECTRICAL

OUTLETS THEY CAN FIX OUR OWN

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.451
CARS. IT'S QUITE AMAZING WHAT

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.819
THEY'RE DOING. WE'VE GOT HOW TO

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:12.355
SHOP SMART. WE HAVE A WORKING

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.090
WITH DIG DEEP FARMS WHERE WOMEN

ARE LEARNING HOW TO GROW THEIR

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:17.026

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.561
BEEN ENGAGING THE CHILDREN WITH

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.796
HAVE HOMEWORK HELPER. IT IS

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.331
IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF THESE

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:23.566
YOUNG KIDS TO HAVE ACTUALLY

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.934
GOTTEN AN EDUCATION BY A

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.136
COMPUTER SCREEN. AND WE'RE SO

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.938
CONCERNED. THAT THESE CHILDREN

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:31.641
HAVE MISSED A YEAR. PLUS OF

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.643
EDUCATION. WHICH WE KNOW THAT.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.744
THAT PUTS THEM ALREADY AT A

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:37.046
DISADVANTAGE AS THEY GROW INTO

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:40.850
ADULTHOOD. AND SO I JUST WANT

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.818
TO SAY THE LAST THING IS THAT-

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:43.953
WE ARE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER AS

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.356
WELL. AND THAT WE HAVE A PHD IN

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.592
FIVE THERAPISTS WHO WORK AT THE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.661
TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER. SOME OF

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:52.995
THOSE ARE BEING DONE REMOTELY

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.665
QUITE EFFECTIVELY WE'VE HAD

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:56.632
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE THAT

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.534

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.708
IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. THAN

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.910
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. AND I

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.979
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS- IN DUE IN

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.448
LARGE PART DUE TO. BOTH THE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.950
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AS WELL AS

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.851

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.248
NOTHING NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOU.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.749
ALSO SELECT OUT THERE SO

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.619
SOMEHOW WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT-

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:44.753
TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR WITH

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.755
THAT. BUT YOU FOLKS THAT HAVE

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.390
MISTER PROGRAMS IN THE NUMBER

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:49.725
OF VIOLENT I'M- MISSING THOSE

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.060
PROGRAMS WERE IN. THE FACILITY

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.028
YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.663
OVER. THE OLD DAYS IT WAS

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.365
FLASHING CARCERI SOMEONE FOR

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.599
THIRTY DAYS. TO GET BACK ON

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:58.834
THAT TRACK SO I'M NOT REALLY

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:01.370
SURE MAYBE. DEAL MILITANTS THAT

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:05.007
DOT SUGGESTION. TO HOW WE HOW

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:07.409
WE DEAL WITH THAT. WELL I KNOW

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:09.077
THAT. FOR SOME OF THE COUNTY SO

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:10.212
WE'RE NOT UNDER THE CHIEF

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.446
JUSTICE'S EMERGENCY ORDER

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:13.115
ANYMORE. BUT FOR SOME OF THE

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:15.050
COUNTIES THEY ARE. AS SOMEBODY

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.518
WHO VIOLATES THEY CAN COME BE

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.586
BROUGHT BACK IN AND THEY'LL PUT

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.154
A BELL ON THEM. SO THAT THEY

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.556
ACTUALLY CAN MEET NEED TO STAY

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.324
AND I THINK THAT YOUR POINT IS

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:22.991
THAT THERE HAS TO BE A

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.726
CONSEQUENCE FOR THE ACTION. AND

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:25.994
IF THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE IN

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.830
THERE'S NO DETERRENT TO. STOP

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.998
ENGAGING IN THE CONDUCT. SO

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.600
HAVING THE FLASHING CORPORATION

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.935
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.469
THING THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT WE

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.838
IT IS MANDATED IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.439
THAT AND- SOMEONE WHO'S

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.074
CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.776
MUST PARTICIPATE IN A FIFTY TWO

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.644
WEEK DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM.

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:45.147
BUT THAT IS- THERE'S ALL THAT

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.149
REALLY ENFORCED. AND TO THE

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.618
SAME TO THE SAME POINT THAT. IF

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.153
SOMEBODY IS ORDER TO GO TO A

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.522
TREATMENT PROGRAM. THAT AND

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.457
THEY JUST DON'T SHOW UP. OR IN

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:56.725
MY COUNTY WE HAD ONE WHERE THEY

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.093
WERE JUST GOING AND PAYING A

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.294
HUNDRED DOLLARS AND LEAVING.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.096
OUT WE HAVE TO HAVE I BELIEVE

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.065
MORE TEETH. TO THAT SO THE

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.066
COURT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE IT

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.500
SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY IT'S

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.668
REPORTED BACK TO THEM THAT THIS

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.737
INDIVIDUAL. IS NOT ATTENDING

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.739
THE PROGRAM- THERE IS A LOT OF

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.808
RESEARCH AROUND THE PROGRAM'S A

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.743
FIFTY TWO WEEK PROGRAM IS. SET

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.545
WITH THE STANDARD CURRICULUM.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.247
AND THERE'S SOME MOVEMENT THAT

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.281
PEOPLE SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.049
MORE DID MORE DIRECTLY ABOUT

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.284
WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE BECAUSE

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.419
NOT EVERYBODY IS. BEING DRIVEN

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:27.022
BY THE SAME BEHAVIOR OR THE

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.725
SAME- ISSUES AND- I DO SUPPORT

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:30.559
THAT I KNOW WITH OUR SEX

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.327
OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD. THAT

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.962
YOU'RE LEGISLATURE PASSED

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.797
LEGISLATION THAT WE PUT A

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.467
SPONSORED. TO INDIVIDUALIZE THE

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:39.268
TREATMENT TO HAVE PEOPLE

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.670
ASSESSED. AND THAT REALLY IS

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.771
ABOUT A RISK ASSESSMENT AND I

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.406
THINK IF WE LOOK AT. DOMESTIC

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.741
VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:46.642
WE LOOK AT OTHER CRIMES OF

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.477
INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. LOOKING

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:50.312
AT RISK IS REALLY THE KEY. AND

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.447
IF WE CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF RE

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.917
OFFENDING THEN. WE HAVE THE

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.585
ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN WORTH IT.

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.654
UP BUT I AND THAT'S ONE AREA

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.155
WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD WE

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.024
COULD EXPLORE MORE. WITH

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.725
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIRST TO

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:06.295
MATCH IT STILL LOOK AT THIS

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:07.062
FAMILY MATTER. AND WE WILL HAVE

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.230
TO TAKE IT OUT OF THAT REALM

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:09.665
AND RECOGNIZES THE VIOLENT

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:13.035
CRIME THAT IT IS. THANK YOU THE

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:14.836
EVER MISTER READING ON YOU TALK

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.439
ABOUT THE REPORTS DOJ GETS THIS

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.474
EVERY CITY REPORT THEIR DATA

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.343
ARE ONLY CITIES OVER A HUNDRED

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.211
THOUSAND POPULATION I BELIEVE

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.080
THIS IS EVER AND IT SHOULD

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.615
COME FROM THE COUNTY'S I

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.517
BELIEVE BUT IT IT IT SHOULD NOT

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:31.486
BE- JUST THE COUNTIES ARE JUST

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:32.754
THE CITIES THAT ARE UNDER A

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:33.789
CERTAIN POPULATION IT IT'S

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:34.690
EVERYBODY COULD YOU ARE

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.224
SOMETIMES WITH WITH WITH FBI

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.926
UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:40.862
WHATEVER THAT IS- THE ONLY GET

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.964
REPORTS OF CITIES OVER HER

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.466
THOUSANDS POPULATION. SO THAT

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.101
SKEWS NUMBERS FOR A LOT OF TALK

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.502
ABOUT ASSAULT AND THE THINGS

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.704
THAT WE SKEWS NUMBER SO I

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.138
DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT NO THAT'S

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.406
IT YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:55.143
POINT AND THE REALITY IS THAT-

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.212
ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.247
THE FBI HAS IN PLACE TO TRACK

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.083
SOME OF THIS- WE TALKED ABOUT

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:02.551
YOU KNOW WASTE WASTE TO IMPROVE

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:03.986
IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:04.820
THE DEPARTMENT IS CERTAINLY

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.823
LOOKING AT AND LOOKING TO- MOVE

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.491
FORWARD ON THAT JUST AS A

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.760
MATTER OF A FACT. WHEN YOU LOOK

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:12.961
AT WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.496
FROM WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:17.165
FROM TWENTY TWENTY SEP FROM

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:17.799
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT MOST OF

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.134
THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IS FROM A

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.969
YEAR AGO AND MOST OF THE DATA

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:23.839
WE HAVE- AS I SAID IT IT MAY

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:25.440
WELL BE THAT THERE'S MORE

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:26.942
INFORMATION THAT HAS YET TO

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.877
COMMENT ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.911
AS WE'RE SITTING HERE HAVING

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.480
THIS DISCUSSION TODAY WE DON'T

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.215
NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST DATA

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:38.653
ON HAND WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.521
TO I BELIEVE IS OFTEN. AT THE

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.256
PRESS TIME. WHEN TALKING ABOUT

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.491
WHAT MAYBE THE ASSAULTS WERE IN

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:44.226
AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.228
DON'T HAVE THAT DATA WHAT FBI

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.629
DOES OR WHAT SOME OTHER

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:48.997
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE. HAS

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.700
TAKEN A SAMPLING. OF SOME

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.368
LARGER CITIES WHAT THEY REPORT

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:55.404
OUT AND THEN TRIED TO

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:56.872
EXTRAPOLATE BASED ON THAT. I

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.073
DON'T HAVE ANY OPINION AN

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.007
APARTMENT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:01.443
HAVE ANY PAIN- ON THAT THE

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.677
POINT IS JUST THAT WE DON'T

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.046
HAVE COMPLETE DATA. AND WE

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.781
DON'T REALLY HAVE COMPLETE DATA

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.850
AND TELL SOME TIME. ACT AFTER

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.552
THE DATE IN QUESTION. THANK YOU

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:11.653

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.188
DIDN'T CATCH THAT SO THE FBI

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.223
REPORTS. INFORMATION USING

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.059
UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING. AND

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:18.627
THE ONLY DEAL WITH CITIES OVER

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.529
A HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION.

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.297
WAS A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:22.964
THAT HAVE BELOW HUNDRED

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.299
THOUSAND POPULATION. JUST THINK

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.801
ABOUT ALL THE CITIES OF LESS

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.469
THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND. PEOPLE

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.071
CITIZENS. NOT CATCHING

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.972
INFORMATION. SO WHEN YOU TALK

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:34.342
ABOUT STATS IN IN CRIME STATS.

TIME FOR THE FIRST PANEL. BUT

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.792
I. I'M IT WOULD BE INTERESTING

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:53.695
TO FIND OUT- ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:56.498
PAST YEAR AND A HALF. HOW MUCH

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.867
OF THAT IS MY FACTOR NUMBERS

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:01.203
WERE STAGGERING. HOW MUCH OF

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.571
THE LACK OF REPORTING OR THE

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.239
LACK OF A REST OR OR

AT THE SAME TIME. AND IT JUST

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:16.918
SO HAPPENS TO BE BOTH COVERT

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.321
AND THIS POLICY HAPPENING. BUT

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.290
IF COVERT WASN'T IN EXISTENCE.

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.925
WITH THE POLICY THAT WE WE'VE

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:24.926

BEING ABLE TURN IN LATE WORK.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:19.861
THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:24.599
THEY HAVE FOR US. WAS TERRIBLE.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:25.566
ON THE OTHER HAND SO MY

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.235

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:37.879
THIS LIFE OF CHAOS. I BELIEVE

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.147
THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:43.151
BENEFITTED. THE STUDENTS MORE

01:28:43.217 --> 01:28:46.187
PACIFIC RESUME I'M NOT SURE HOW

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.722
WE WOULD HAVE LEARNED WITHOUT

ZOOM AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:50.958
FOR THAT. LEARNING THROUGH

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.226
SCREEN WAS IMMENSELY DIFFICULT

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:55.296
BUT- THE TEACHERS SOME WERE

HAPPENING DURING THIS PANDEMIC

WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING THEY

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:11.092
WERE HURTING ANYONE. BUT THAT

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:12.760
DIDN'T STOP INDIVIDUALS FROM

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:13.394
BELIEVING THAT THEY HAD A RIGHT

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:16.497
TO HURT THEM. EARLIER THIS YEAR

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:17.431
I WITNESSED A VIDEO OF AN

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:19.000
ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN WHO HAD

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:20.902
BEEN ATTACKED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:21.936
SHOULD A LARGE PURPLE BRUISE

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:24.038
OVER HER EYE AND WAS CRYING

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:25.773
WHILE HER ASSAILANT WAS

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.274
RECEIVING MERIT MEDICAL

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:28.542
ATTENTION. THE CRIES I HEARD IN

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.444
THE VIDEO STRUCK ME. I

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:31.112
IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF MY

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.747
GRANDMOTHER A KOREAN AMERICAN

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.048

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.385
IMAGINING HER WALKING DOWN THE

STREET OR COMING OUT OF CHURCH

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:40.955
TO BE ATTACKS SIMPLY BECAUSE

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:43.991
SOMEONE SOCCER ASIAN FEATURES.

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:45.359
WHEN THE SHOOTING IN ATLANTA

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.560
HI. WHEN THE SHOOTING IN THE

AGAIN HAD A SIMILAR RESPONSE

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:51.699
THIS TIME I THOUGHT OF MY MOM.

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:52.500
THOSE THE ONES WITH THE

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.468
SHOOTINGS OCCURRED LEVINE OR

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:55.002

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.204
DESCENT. WHO KNOWS OF ANOTHER

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:58.773
SHOOTING OR ANOTHER ATTACK

01:32:58.839 --> 01:32:59.707
COULD OCCUR IN SIMILAR

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.208
LOCATIONS. AT AN ASIAN

01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:02.410
SUPERMARKET. AT AN ASIAN

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:04.879
RESTAURANT. TO HAVE TO LIVE IN

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.881
FEAR THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:07.748
COULD HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY OR

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.750
MYSELF. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE LOOK

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:10.851
DIFFERENT OR THAT WE HAD

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.486
SOMETHING TO DO WITH OF IN

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:15.222
NINETEEN. IS DRAMATIC. IN THE

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.691

VIOLENCE BEING PERPETRATED

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.465
AGAINST PEOPLE OF ASIAN DESCENT.

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:25.766
WE HAD A SHOWING OF NEARLY

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.401
FIFTY PEOPLE AND PUTTING SOME

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:28.235

COUNCIL INTENDED. TO SHOW THAT

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.472
WE WOULD STAND UP TO ACCESS.

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:34.608
THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE. AND

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:36.677
THEN WE ALSO SAW THE SHOOTING

HEARD THIS. ME AND MANY OTHERS

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.625

THE RISING VIOLENCE. THE

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.174
TROUBLE WE FACE AS INDIVIDUALS

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.342
AS A RESULT OF INTERPERSONAL

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:09.710
VIOLENCE. IS ALSO FELT AS A

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:12.079
COMMUNITY. WE LIVE IN A

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.881
CONNECTED WORLD WHERE WE SEE

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.317

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:20.254
SHARE. WE NO LONGER CAN IGNORE

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.023
THAT THE WORLD IS IN SILENT.

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:24.291
BUT WHEN AND THAT THE TRAUMA

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:25.192
ONE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES IN

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.495
ONE PART OF THE WORLD CANNOT

TOMORROW. WE HAVE BEEN ILLIQUID

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.365
TO HANDLE THE IMPACTS THESE

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.234
DRAMATIC EVENTS HAVE ON US. WE

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.869
HAVE TO FOCUS ON HOW TO PROVIDE

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:35.569
RESOURCES TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.438

SPEAK ON HOW THESE INCIDENTS

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.016
NEED TO STOP. BUT I BELIEVE

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.317
THERE WAS AN ABSENCE IN THE

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:52.453
RESOURCES WE CAN TURN TO HANDLE

MEETING- OPENING TEAM SAFETY

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.822
PROCEDURES IN PLACE HAS BEEN A

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.691
STRUGGLE BUT I THINK AGENCIES

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.292

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:33.493

GAPS AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS.

THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY IMPUTED

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:47.307
IN BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.875
SURVIVORS DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:51.278
IT'S A LITTLE LESS SO NOW BUT I

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:53.480
THINK ONE MAJOR WHICH WE ALL

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.082
KNOW WHAT IT IS ESPECIALLY IF

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:57.117
YOU RUN A NONPROFIT IS FUNDING

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.820
RIGHT. ALL THE FUNDING THAT

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:01.688
KIND OF STOPPED WE HAD SOME

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:03.356
LOCAL FUNDS THAT YOU CAN KINDA

01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:05.559
COLLECTOR S. RIGHT THERE WERE

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.728
SOME ACTION NEED FOR

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:09.096
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:10.497
RECEIVING STIMULUS TRACKS TO BE

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:13.767
ABLE TO PAY RENT- THERE WAS

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.602
WHEN THE COURT SHUT DOWN OUR

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:18.438
COURT SYSTEM ISN'T ONLINE YET

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:19.606
AND SO THEY HAD TO KIND OF

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:22.209
SCRAMBLE TO CREATE A WAITED.

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.510
FILE RESTRAINING ORDERS WITHOUT

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:24.945
HAVING TO HAVE THE PUBLIC COME

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:27.047
IN PERSON SO THERE WERE SEVERAL

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:30.050
DIFFERENT ASPECTS SYSTEM WIDE

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:31.585
THAT NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:33.220

ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.127
AGAIN I THINK THE ONE THING

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:42.729
THAT WAS ESSENTIAL IS THAT

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:44.998

AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD ALL

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:20.319
CLOSED. AND SO I FOUND MYSELF

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:22.622

AND THEY WERE ABLE TO HOUSE HER

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:33.833
FOR NINETY DAYS. USUALLY IT'S A

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.001
TWENTY ONE DAY HOLD BUT I'M FOR

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:36.669

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:45.111
JUST AROUND THE STATE. AFTER

01:59:45.177 --> 01:59:47.246
THAT WE REPLACED HER I. WAS

01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:48.147
LOOKING FOR PLACES THAT SHE

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:50.416
COULD GO THAT WEREN'T LONG TERM

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:52.652
AND AGAIN COULD NOT FIND ANY

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.220
PLACES FOR TRAFFICKED GIRL TO

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.755

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:57.557
WHEN WE MADE THE PLANS TO OPEN

01:59:57.623 --> 02:00:00.793

AND REUNIFICATION SUPPORT- AND

02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:19.145
THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS-

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:20.980
WE HAVE NOTICED A AN EXTREME

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:23.683

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:38.831
VIOLENCE. AND THIS GIRL WAS

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:40.600
JUST ONE OF MANY THAT WOULD

02:00:40.666 --> 02:00:42.868
HAVE BEEN TURNED PERHAPS RIGHT

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:44.437
BACK OUT ON THE STREET IF A

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:45.905
PARENT DIDN'T PICK THEM UP. OR

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:47.473
PERHAPS MAYBE A PARENT WOULD

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.774
CALM BUT A PARENT WHO WAS

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:50.176
LIVING IN CAR POVERTY

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:51.577

AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE.

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:11.470
THROUGHOUT MY CAREER IN PUBLIC

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:13.138
SERVICE I'VE DEVOTED MYSELF TO

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:14.807
THE VOCATION. OF PROVIDING

02:05:14.874 --> 02:05:16.575
SUPPORT TO SURVIVORS. OF BOTH

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:18.177
DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL SEXUAL

02:05:18.244 --> 02:05:20.546
VIOLENCE. FOR MANY OF US THE

02:05:20.613 --> 02:05:22.114
IDEA OF BEING AN ABUSIVE

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.782
PARTNER MAKES ABSOLUTELY BEING

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.718
WITH AN ABUSIVE PARTNER MAKES

02:05:25.784 --> 02:05:28.520
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE PRIDE

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:30.789
OURSELVES ASKING WHY THEY STAY.

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:31.590
IF ONLY THAT WERE TRUE AND THAT

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:33.759
SIMPLE. HOWEVER THE REASON THAT

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.261
MANY SURVIVORS REMAIN SILENT

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:36.896
AND IN THE SHADOWS FOR LONG

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.697
PERIODS OF TIME IS BECAUSE THE

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.666
ABUSE ISN'T JUST PHYSICAL IS

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.701
ALSO EMOTIONAL. IT IS TO THAT

02:05:42.768 --> 02:05:45.137
EMOTIONAL SKEWS ME ABUSE THAT

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:47.106

MY WORK I'VE LEARNED THAT THE

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.114
KEY TO GETTING A SURVIVOR TO

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.448
LEADER SITUATION IS CREATING A

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.350
SUPPORT SYSTEM. AROUND THEM

02:05:58.417 --> 02:05:59.618

WHEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD TURNED A

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:04.503
CORNER AND SEE A REAL CHANGE-

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:05.204
ONE OF LOCAL PROGRAM SHARED

THOSE KEY AREAS OF SUPPORTER IS

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:32.498
IN THE REALM OF HOUSING AND

THAT. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:41.373
THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.774
WHICH WE HAVE THE STATE CAN DO

02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:45.544

THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ALTHOUGH

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:02.127

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.622
BENEFITS. PRIOR TO JOINING

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:19.691
WESTERN CENTER I WAS EIGHT

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:20.725
TENANTS RIGHT TO THE BEACH AND

02:18:20.792 --> 02:18:22.360
DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LOCK

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:25.063
ANGELA RYE FRESH ALIVE IN THE

02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:26.731
PICTURE AS WELL AS WORKING WITH

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:28.633
SURVIVORS ANYTHING EVICTION.

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.901
AND ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:31.836
I THOUGHT WOULD BE PROVIDED IN

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.338
SECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:35.473
A VERY TOUGH DECISION BETWEEN

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:38.677
FACING HOMELESSNESS OR ABUSE

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:40.078
AND OFTEN TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD

02:18:40.145 --> 02:18:42.614
THE DECISION- THEY EITHER FELL

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:47.886
INTO HOMELESSNESS. OR THEY WENT

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:48.820
BACK TO THE YEAR. AND SO WE

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:50.455
KNOW THAT HOW IS. IN HOW MUCH

02:18:50.522 --> 02:18:52.590
ARE IN. LEAN BACK WE THAT NINE

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:53.725
TWO PER. OF WOMEN WHO ARE

02:18:53.792 --> 02:18:55.060
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.195
ALSO EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF

02:18:57.262 --> 02:19:00.832
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND 50% OF

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:02.400
WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

02:19:02.467 --> 02:19:03.735
WE'RE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:04.869
VIOLENCE AND THE MONTHS

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.237
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THEIR

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:08.707
HOMELESSNESS. AND ANOTHER THING

02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:10.375
I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:11.910
THE DISCUSSION IS THAT IT'S

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:14.512
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.247
INTERPERSONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:18.316
DID NOT IMPACT ALL SURVIVORS

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:20.385
THE SAME WAY THAT THOSE

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:20.985
SURVIVORS WORK FROM

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.520
MARGINALIZED IMMIGRANT

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:24.189
COMMUNITIES OFTEN FACE

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:26.725
ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SERVICES

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.426
AND THAT BE LANGUAGE BARRIERS

02:19:28.493 --> 02:19:29.894
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR

02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:31.830
STATUS. OR OTHER TYPES OF

02:19:31.896 --> 02:19:33.898
HOUSING BARRIERS- FOR EXAMPLE

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:35.700
RACIAL OR ETHNIC BARRIERS TO

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:37.268
ACCESSING HOUSING. FOR

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:39.304
IMMIGRANT WOMEN THERE IN THE

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:41.439
48% INCREASE IN DOMESTIC

02:19:41.506 --> 02:19:43.508
VIOLENCE AFTER THEY EMIGRATE TO

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:45.477
THE UNITED STATES BUT WE DID

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:46.878
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A

02:19:46.945 --> 02:19:48.513
SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:50.448
REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:52.650
CASES FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:53.551
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN REPORTS OF

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:55.720
ICE ARRESTING SURVIVORS REPORT

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:57.655
THEIR RECEIPT. AND OTHER VIBER

02:19:57.722 --> 02:19:58.690
TO SEEK RELIEF THROUGH

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:00.825
PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BALLOT OR

02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:02.393
TRIED TO ENGAGE IN AND BENEFIT

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:03.828
THAT THEY MAY HAVE BETTER

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:05.897
LEAVE. THERE'S A POWER DYNAMIC

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:07.832
BECAUSE THEIR ISSUES ARE HAVE

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.200

SERVICES. THEY CAN DO SO

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:42.367
WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:46.137
ADMINISTRATIVE. DELAYS BUT I

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:47.071

SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS. AND SO

02:20:57.782 --> 02:21:00.585
THE FIRST ONE IN BY ENGAGING

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:03.288
AND- AND IMPROVING SURVIVOR

SERVICES THAT WERE DEFECTING

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:08.893
THE SECOND TO THE STATE HAVE TO

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.628
BE TRAUMA INFORMED AND THEY

02:21:10.695 --> 02:21:12.664
HAVE TO BE SURVIVOR CENTERED

02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:13.665
AND THEY SHOULDN'T EXCLUDE

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:14.966
PROVIDER RATE BASED ON

02:21:15.033 --> 02:21:18.536
STANDING. AND THEY SHOULD ALSO

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:21.840
PRIVATE ACT THE THING UP BUT

02:21:21.906 --> 02:21:23.007
THERE IS. FOR EXAMPLE AND THE

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:24.809
ADULT VALLEY AND LOS ANGELES

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:26.544
COUNTY THERE ARE THREE

02:21:26.611 --> 02:21:28.313
DIFFERENT RIGHT IT. WELL ONE OF

02:21:28.379 --> 02:21:29.914
THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT THE

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:31.716
SURVIVOR GOES TO THE ACTUAL

02:21:31.783 --> 02:21:34.219
BRICK AND MORTAR AREA. AND IN

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:35.520
THE ANTELOPE VALLEY IT'S A

02:21:35.587 --> 02:21:36.588
PRETTY LARGE AREA MANY

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:39.324
SURVIVORS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:40.959
TO A CAR IN ORDER TO GET THE

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:42.727
BRICK AND MORTAR AREA. AND SO

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:46.164
THAT PROVIDE THE BARE YEAR FOR

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:46.965
THEM TO ACCESS THE SERVICES.

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:49.567
ONE WAITED. THAT WOULD NEED TO

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.236
INVEST IN LOW BARRIER MOBILE

02:21:51.302 --> 02:21:54.172
THIRD THING. THAT WILL NEED TO

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:55.874
MEET THE SURVIVOR IN AN AREA

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.342
WHERE THEY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:58.443
THAT COULD BE LIKE A COFFEE

02:21:58.509 --> 02:22:00.078
SHOP OR PARK OR WHEREVER THEY

02:22:00.144 --> 02:22:01.846
FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE. SO THAT

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.448
THERE IS THAT- BUT THEY CAN

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:04.949
MEET THE SURVIVOR AND PROVIDE

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:07.018
THE SERVICES. THERE'S ALSO

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:08.653
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE I KNOW

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.688
LANGUAGE ACCESS OR BECAUSE THEY

02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:13.491
ARE WORKING REMOTE IT'S YOU

02:22:13.558 --> 02:22:15.326

WANT TO WORK PROGRAMS THAT USE

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:21.432
LANGUAGE BARRIER. AND ALTHOUGH

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.935
THING FOR THE I'M ACCESS TO

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:26.938
SERVICE. AND WE DO FIND IN SOME

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:30.008
AREAS THAT- THERE IS. NOT A

02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:32.043
GREAT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:33.745
LINK OF HOUSING SERVICES.

02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:35.580
PROVIDERS AND THOSE

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:37.582
EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:39.017
BECAUSE THEY DO YOU FACE.

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:41.419
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS COMPARED

02:22:41.486 --> 02:22:43.588
TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT OF YET.

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.590
EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:47.225
SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:49.060
HOUSING PROVIDERS OR ANY

02:22:49.127 --> 02:22:50.628
SERVICES THAT OFFER HOUSING

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:52.297
SERVICES. MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:54.699
ARE THOMAS INFORMED AND VERY

02:22:54.766 --> 02:22:58.236
UNIQUE TO PROVIDE FOR. AND

02:22:58.303 --> 02:22:59.704
THAT'S AREA THAT WE WOULD TO

02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:02.206
BOOK ON THAT LIKE THE STATE

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:06.477
OKAY ON IS. TRUMP THE THIRD.

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:07.912
DID YOU WHAT DID FOR THEM AND

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:09.514
FOR THE UNIQUE SITUATION AND

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:10.915
ONE OF THE BEST WAY THEY CAN DO

02:23:10.982 --> 02:23:13.451
THAT BY PROVIDING UNRESTRICTED.

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:16.688
I'M CAPS DIRECT FUNDING TO THE

02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:18.189
SURVIVOR THEMSELVES. NOW

02:23:18.256 --> 02:23:20.525
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAVE

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:21.960
NINETEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO

02:23:22.026 --> 02:23:23.428
YOU HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING OUR

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:25.363
FEDERAL PRACTICAL FINDING MORE

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:27.031
SURVIVORS. BUT THE SURVIVOR

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:28.466
OFTEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:29.801
PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE PROGRAM

02:23:29.867 --> 02:23:31.369
GIVING THE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:33.137
THE PROVIDER. AND NUMBER

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:34.739
EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:37.408
I SAW- WELL LITIGATING A

02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:40.378
PARTICULAR IN THE- YOU CAN'T

02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:42.580
THEM OFF AND TO LIVE IS THAT.

02:23:42.647 --> 02:23:44.916
FEEDS SURVIVOR HAD IT THE

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:46.584
ABUSER ARRESTED AND REMOVED

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:48.920
FROM THE HOME. BUT THE FACT THE

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:50.321
RUBBER COULDN'T PAY FOR THE

02:23:50.388 --> 02:23:53.524
RENT BECAUSE- YOU. YOU'RE

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:55.426
CONTROLLING ALL OF THE FINANCES

02:23:55.493 --> 02:23:57.729
AND THE SURVIVOR DIDN'T HAVE

02:23:57.795 --> 02:23:59.664
ECONOMIC SECURITY. FOR THE

02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:01.432
ORGANIZATION THAT WE WORK WITH

02:24:01.499 --> 02:24:04.102
OFFERED TO PROVIDE THE LANDLORD

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:06.471
WHERE. THE RENT THE LANDLORD

02:24:06.537 --> 02:24:07.472
REFUSED TO TAKE IT IN THE

02:24:07.538 --> 02:24:10.041
LANDMARK DID NOT WANT TO FINE.

02:24:10.108 --> 02:24:12.010
INVADE THEIR TAX DOCUMENTS. I

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:13.745
KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE OPTION

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.313
FOR THE PROVIDER. THEY CAN

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.347
EITHER CONTINUE WITH THE

02:24:16.414 --> 02:24:18.182
ADDICTION AND ADDICTION

02:24:18.249 --> 02:24:20.218
PROTECTION FOR SURVIVORS ARE

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.686
NOT VERY STRONG IN CALIFORNIA

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:29.093
BECAUSE- SOME OF. THE LARGE. OR

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.862
THEY CAN I HAVE A SETTLEMENT OF

02:24:30.928 --> 02:24:33.664

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:34.866
TEMPORARY SHELTERS. AND

IT OPTION AND SHE- ALMOST NEXT.

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.273
BUT THIS NOT HAVE BEEN A

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.942
PROBLEM A VERY IN SHE THE

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:46.677
FUNDING TO GIVEN TO. BECAUSE

02:24:46.744 --> 02:24:48.546
SHE COULD HAVE. THE RENT GOING

02:24:48.613 --> 02:24:49.814
FORWARD AND THE- AND THERE

02:24:49.881 --> 02:24:51.549
WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT.

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:53.951
DOCUMENT REQUIRE NAY FROM THE

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:58.890
PROGRAM. AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT

02:24:58.956 --> 02:25:01.359
PROVIDE VERY- YOU NEED SOME FOR

02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:02.760
DATE WE HAVE TO TRUST THAT THEY

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:04.262
WILL USE IT FOR THEIR NEEDS

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:06.064
YEAH KNOW WHETHER THAT- I HAD

02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:07.598
ONE MOM WHO HAD TO CHOOSE

02:25:07.665 --> 02:25:09.133
BETWEEN THE RENT OR PAYING. FOR

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.172
THE ON HER CAR. AND BUT THE

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:15.840
LAST THING THAT I DO WANT TO

02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:19.010
FOCUS ON IS AS DEVELOPING AND

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:20.711
FINDING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

02:25:20.778 --> 02:25:22.313
THAT WORKING CONTENT INJECTION

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.448
WITH COMMUNITY TO BUILD LASTING

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:25.750
RELATIONSHIPS AND WORK THE

02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:27.652
PRIVATE FACILITY. AS WE'VE

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:29.353
HEARD THERE IS A LACK OF

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTICULARLY

ALWAYS HEARD THE PHRASE AND AN

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:27.531
OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS BETTER

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:29.634

02:38:22.659 --> 02:38:23.694
THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH MORE

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:25.662

02:38:48.185 --> 02:38:52.389
NOT ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE TO LIKE.

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:53.190
TO HEAL FROM WHAT THEY'VE

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:55.292
EXPERIENCED AND RECEIVE WHAT

02:38:55.359 --> 02:38:57.794
THEY NEED- I THINK THAT THERE

02:38:57.861 --> 02:38:59.863
SHOULD BE A LOT MORE. THOUGHT

02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:01.598
INTO HOW PEOPLE ARE TREATED

02:39:01.665 --> 02:39:02.699
ESPECIALLY THOSE VULNERABLE

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:04.501
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:06.236

02:39:10.274 --> 02:39:11.742

PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF

02:39:13.677 --> 02:39:14.444
EIGHTEEN OR EVEN UNDER THE AGE

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:18.382
UNTIL TWENTY FIVE. THERE SHOULD

02:39:18.448 --> 02:39:22.920
BE MORE- AND SO THERE SHOULD BE

02:39:22.986 --> 02:39:24.855
MORE TRAINING BY LAW

02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:26.623
