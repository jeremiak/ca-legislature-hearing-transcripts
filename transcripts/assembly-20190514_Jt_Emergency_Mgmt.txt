AND GET STARTED IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYONE'S TIME. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS CHRISTY SMITH AND I'M THE CHAIR PROUDLY OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AT THE COMMITTEE IS HOLDING THIS HEARING TO EXAMINE CALIFORNIA'S PREPARATION FOR THE CHALLENGE OF PREVENTING AND FIGHTING WILDFIRES IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND BEYOND. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRE ACTIVITY WITH INCREASES IN THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF FIRES. WILDFIRES ARE NOT ONLY MORE FREQUENT BUT THEY ARE FAR MORE DEVASTATING AND DEADLY. FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND TEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN THE STATE'S FIRE SEASON IS NOW ALMOST YEAR ROUND AND MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA WILD LANDS ARE NOW CLASSIFIED AS UNDER VERY HIGH. OR EXTREME FIRE THREAT. ABSOLUTELY 25% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THAT HIGH RISK AREA. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA WAS THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON ON RECORD WITH OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIRES BURNING AN AREA OF ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION ACRES. FOR ALMOST THREE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THIS IS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BURNED ACREAGE EVER RECORDED IN A FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA. STARTING ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAMPFIRE BECAME THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IT IS ALSO THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS. AFTER TWO YEARS OF DISASTROUS FIRE SEASONS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF GAP GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. HAS COMMITTED TO FUNDING AND CREATING AN EXPANDED OVERALL STRATEGY OF FIRE PREPARATION MITIGATION. ADDITIONAL CREWS EQUIPMENT AND BETTER FOREST MANAGEMENT. IN ITS FIRST HUNDRED DAYS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN THE DECISIVE ACTION TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK WALTERS BOLSTER THE STATE'S EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. AND RECOVERY CAPACITY AND PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET HAS PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S PREPAREDNESS INCREASE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY INCIDENTS. AND INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS FOLLOWS ACTION IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN CALLED FOR DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF FOREST LAND TREATED EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH THE LEGISLATURE YOU'RE MARKING ONE BILLION. OVER FIVE YEARS IN FUNDS GENERATED BY THE STATE'S CARBON TRADING PROGRAM. AS A RESULT THE STATE IS NOW SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING ITS INVESTMENT IN FIRE SAFETY BY SPENDING MORE ON FIRE FIGHTING IN CALIFORNIA AND EMBRACING A NEW PROACTIVE WAY OF FIGHTING THE NEW NORMAL. OF WILDFIRES. WILDFIRE RESPONSE IS NOT SOLELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT MUST ALSO INVOLVE A CONCERTED EFFORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRIVATE LANDOWNERS BUSINESSES AND OUR CITIZENS. ONLY WHEN ALL OF THESE GROUPS WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STATE IN PARTNERSHIP WE WILL HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN WILDFIRE SEASON. THIS HEARING WILL START A COMPREHENSIVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN SUPPORT OUR PARTNER AGENCIES COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THIS WORK. I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TO START THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND NOW ALL HANDED OFF TO OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WELCOME TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT. JOINT COMMITTEE. HAVING SERVED AS HE THE THE CHURCH VICE CHAIR FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I CAN TELL YOU -- WE HAVE NEEDED. TO BE HERE MORE AND MORE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE STATE UNDERGOING THESE ENORMOUS NATURAL DISASTERS WHICH SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE EVERY YEAR. AND OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING TODAY FROM -- SOME OF THE EXPERTS WHO HAVE BECOME EXPERT NOT ONLY STUDYING THE ISSUE BUT LIVING IT. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. WE FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS FIGHTING THE LARGEST WILDFIRES THE STATE HAS. EVER SEEN ADDRESSING A CHANGING CLIMATE. ADDRESSING THE THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE STRUCK SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT OF THESE FIRES. WHAT THE LESSONS ARE THAT WE'VE LEARNED WHAT THE -- WHAT WHAT ARE THE POLICIES IN PLACE AND PERHAPS --I KNOW THAT THAT IS PART OF THE PAPER THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED WITH THIS -- I KNOW I'M INTERESTED IN -- HOW WE ARE IMPLEMENTING OR PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES? AND THEN WHAT IT IS WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE UPON THEM. IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH ALL PHASES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BECAUSE ALL PHASES OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY STATE LAND LOCAL LANDS OR FEDERAL LANDS. THESE FIRES DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND FRANKLY DON'T CARE -- AND SO WE AS A LEGISLATURE I THINK NEED TO BE. A REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW WE CAN BEST ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF MOTHER NATURE. WHO IS I ALWAYS? REFER TO IS -- TO KEEPING HER PLAYBOOK VERY CLOSE TO HER CHEST -- AND NOT SHARING IT WITH US -- I DID WANT -- TO INDICATING IN THE PRESS -- PREPARED A PAPER -- THERE WERE FEW BILLS THAT I DID -- THERE WEREN'T REFERENCE IN A COUPLE BILLS THAT I'VE GOT GOING FORWARD THAT I HOPE THAT WE'LL HEAR SOME COMMENTS ABOUT -- ONE THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS JUST BE TWELVE SIXTY WHICH IS AN OMNIBUS FIRE PREVENTION FORESTRY MANAGEMENT BILL. THAT WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE VERY THE RELEVANT AGENCIES I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO HEAR HOW THAT'S GOING TO HEAR WHERE IT'S GOING WELL WHERE THERE. ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD IMPROVE UPON CERTAINLY THE SAME WITH SB NINE A ONE BY SENATOR DODD. AND OTHERS WHO HAD LEGISLATION LAST YEAR IS IT WORKING ARE WE GOING FORWARD ARE THERE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED AND AND HERE WERE ALSO FROM OUR LOCAL -- AND COUNTY OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE AS WELL -- WE TALKED ABOUT HOME HARDENING LAST YEAR I DID A BILL AS BEFORE SIXTY FIVE USING PACE FUNDS. THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY -- THE ROBUST BUT PERHAPS WE CAN DISCUSS HOW WE GO ABOUT BETTER. OF FUNDING THE THE NEED TO FINANCE -- THESE PROJECTS TO HARDEN OUR HOMES -- I DID A AN EMERGENCY ALERT BILL -- LAST YEAR AT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES WE DISCOVERED IN SO MANY THESE FIRES AS WE ARE NOT GETTING THE WORD OUT FAST ENOUGH OR WITH THE LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY THAT'S NEEDED. HOW'S THAT GOING -- THIS YEAR -- I'VE TRIED TO EXPAND UPON THAT -- AND WOOD I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW WELL THAT'S WORKING -- THAT SO A BILL -- SB -- FORTY SIX SP ONE SIXTY ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE PERHAPS THERE'LL BE SOME FOLKS HERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE DON'T AND NOT EVERYBODY SPEAKS ENGLISH AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND WHEN WE HAD THE THOMAS FIRE. IN MY DISTRICT THEY WERE USING THE GOOGLE TRANSLATION WHICH REFERRED TO THE THOMAS FIRE AS THE HAIR BRUSH FIRE IN SPANISH THAT DOESN'T QUITE DO THE JOB -- AND THEN -- FINALLY I I'VE GOT A BILL THIS YEAR SB ONE EIGHTY TWO TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES BY STRENGTHENING LOCAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES. AND DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGIES -- FOR STRUCTURES IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS WITH MEASURES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- TAKE A LOOK AT LESSONS LEARNED AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THOSE BECAUSE IT'S FIRE SEASON NOW -- I KNOW WE'VE GOT A WEEK OF RAIN SCHEDULE FOR SACRAMENTO SO PEOPLE STE THINK WHERE WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS BUT WE KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FOR TAKING ON THIS. VERY IMPORTANT TASK IN THE AND STAFF AS WELL AND GLAD TO SEE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ONE OF THE FOR OTHER FIRE AREAS HERE BECAUSE WE REALLY -- THE THE NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IS TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TRY TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON UP ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS. I'M KNOW I'LL LEAVE IT TO OUR PANELS I'M SURE THEY HAVE LOTS OF THINGS TO TELL US TODAY AND SHARE WITH US ONCE AGAIN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL ATTENDING. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL GET RIGHT TO IT AND START THIS CONVERSATION -- I'D LIKE TO WELCOME UP FOR TESTIMONY -- REVA FELDMAN CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF MALIBU REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. MICHAEL GUSMAN DEPUTY COUNTY ADMINISTRATION THIS ADMINISTRATOR OFFICE OF RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY SO NO MY COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND TRACY RIGS COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR TO WOLLEMI COUNTY REPRESENTING THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO YOUR TESTIMONY IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE ACROSS ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND AGAIN IT WAS A PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMUNITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO START WITH. THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK SO MUCH CAN BE LEARNED -- FROM OUR PEOPLE ON THE GROUND LITERALLY THE RESPONSE THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOMENT BECAUSE VERY OFTEN IN RESPONSE TO THESE EMERGENCIES IS IS AS UNIQUE AS THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH WHICH IS BEING IMPACTED RIGHT SO -- AGAIN WE WELCOME EACH OF YOU HERE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN AS YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RITA FELDMAN AND THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF MALIBU AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- AND THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CITY MANAGER DEPARTMENT FOR THE LEAK AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR THE CALIFORNIA CITY MANAGEMENT FOUNDATION -- SO I AND COME WITH A LOT OF BACKGROUND FROM OTHER CITY MANAGERS -- AS YOU KNOW THE WALLS THE FIRE AND HIT OUR AREA ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH WE WERE THE THIRD FIRED THAT DAY THAT BROKE OUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- BUT AS I ALWAYS TELL THE STORY I LIKE TO START WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT WEEK FOR US A WE WERE UNDER A PS PS WATCH FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- SO WE WERE ON VERY HIGH ALERT THAT WE WOULD BE LOSING POWER -- WE ALSO HAD A LOCAL ELECTION WHERE WE HAD TO COUNCIL MEMBERS TURNED OUT -- A NEW COUNTY SHERIFF THE AND OBVIOUSLY A NEW GOVERNOR THAT WAS ELECTED. AND ON WEDNESDAY EVENING NOVEMBER SEVENTH -- WE EXPERIENCE THE BORDERLINE GRILL SHOOTING IN OUR AREA ON THAT AFFECTED -- SO MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING STUDENTS AT PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS LOCATED IN MALIBU. FIVE AND WE DID LOSE A STUDENT AND SO ON THAT WAS WHAT WE WOKE UP TO ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH AND THEN OF COURSE THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT ABOUT. THREE O'CLOCK SO -- IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK FOR EVERYONE TO REALIZE THE STRAIN THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WERE UNDER ON AFTER THAT SHOOTING. AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH ON THAT YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS -- FIRST OF ALL THE LACK OF POWER -- WE DID NOT HAVE OUR POWER TURNED OFF BUT THE ELECTRICITY DID GO OUT THROUGHOUT OUR CITY IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH MALIBU -- WE'RE ABOUT TWENTY MILES LONG AND ONE MILE DEEP AND OUR MAIN ROAD IS PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY WHICH IS SERVED BY TRAFFIC SIGNALS SO IF THE POWER GOES OUT WE LOSE ALL OF OUR TRAFFIC SIGNALS. WHICH ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY CALTRANS -- WAR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PER BY DID BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BUT ON THE C. H. P. ACTUALLY HASTERT JURISTIC. JURISDICTION OVER THE SIGNALS -- SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE GOT THE NOTIFICATION TO EVACUATE OUR ENTIRE CITY ON IMMEDIATELY AND WE HAD TO SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ALL THESE PEOPLE OUT ONE DIRECTION ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. THERE WAS CONCERN NOT ONLY WITH THE WALLS THE FIRE THAT WAS HEADED TOWARDS MALIBU UP WITH A FOURTEEN MILE LONG FRONT OF THE FIRE. ON THAT THERE IS ALSO THE HELL FIRE BURNING ON THE NORTH WEST END OF OUR TOWNWHICH MADE EVACUATING THAT WAY -- NOT A POSSIBILITY SO WE HAD TO SEND EVERYBODY SOUTH EAST ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. ON THE STORIES THAT MY RESIDENTS TELL OUR SIX HOURS TO GET THROUGH -- SIGNALS -- COMPLETE COMPLETE GRIDLOCK -- I WAS AT OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AT CITY HALL A WE WERE STRUGGLING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE GREAT CELL SERVICE -- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF POWER -- AND WE WERE TOLD VIA EMAIL OF THAT RESOURCES FROM CALTRANS AND CHP HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO ASSIST WITH. TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT BUT HOWEVER THEY HIDE IT. SO ONE OF MY FIRST ASKS -- ANYWHERE I GO IS THAT THERE ARE MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES DISPATCH TO HELP WITH EVACUATIONS ON NO MATTER WHERE THAT THE FIRE IS I'M NOT THE ONLY COMMUNITY. THAT HAS THIS TYPE OF A STRUGGLE WITH PEOPLE GETTING OUT THREE SIGNALS IF YOU'RE. LOOKING AT YOU KNOW SAN MATTEO AND YOU NEEDED TO USE EL CAMINO RIEL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS -- SO THAT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT THING THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE LACK OF POWER IS THAT OUR RESIDENTS. AND MANY OF THEM DID NOT GET THE EVACUATION NOTICE -- WE DID DO HAVE A OF ROBOTS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WE USE IT REGULARLY -- STAFF IS TRAINED ON USING IT WE HAD TESTED ARE REVERSED NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THREE TIMES IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS -- BUT WITHOUT POWER PEOPLE DON'T GET THOSE NOTIFICATIONS -- THERE IS NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE VIA THE INTERNET THERE'S NO POWER AND IN THAT TYPE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET SELF SERVICE ON A GOOD DAY SO PARTICULARLY WHEN CELL TOWERS -- OUT AND NOW IT WAS A CHALLENGE THAT WE FACED -- NOT ONLY THE DAY OF THE FIRE AND DURING EVACUATIONS BUT THROUGHOUT THE FIRE INCIDENT -- WE HAD -- SEVERAL HUNDRED RESIDENTS WHO STAYED BEHIND AND THEY WERE BASICALLY CUT OFF FROM EVERYBODY ON BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF SELF SERVICE. I WAS BEGGING FOR TEMPORARY CELL SERVICE TO BE BROUGHT IN BUT IT TOOK DAYS AND DAYS. AND ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IMPLEMENTING -- GOOD OLD FASHIONED SIRENS AND ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COULD BE USED TO ALERT PEOPLE ON AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY GOOD OPTION. ON THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD IS BECAUSE WE WERE THE THIRD FIRE ON THAT DAY ON THE FIRE RESOURCES TOOK SOME TIME TO GET TO US. ON AND SO IF SOMETHING WERE OF VERY CONCERNED ABOUT FOR THE FUTURE FOR ANY COMMUNITY IF THERE'S MULTIPLE FIRES THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND AND NOT SOMETHING THAT -- I THINK WE ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION. FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT I DID WAS -- I DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO KICK IN FAR ARE MERCHANTS OPERATIONS CENTER. AND WE HAD TO EVACUATE OUT OF OUR CITY HALL WHICH IS WHERE OUR EOC IS AND WE ACTUALLY RELOCATED TO THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA WHERE WE RAN OUR EOC FOR THREE WEEKS -- SO I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEARBY SO CITIES WHO WERE WILLING TO HOST US -- AND THEN -- WERE ALSO SMALL CITY WITH ABOUT NINETY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DEPTH TO CONTINUE RUNNING OUR EOC AND I JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE. AND CALLED MY FRIENDS IN OTHER CITIES AND SAID I NEED HELP -- BUT WITHOUT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD GIVEN THE TIME THAT IT TYPICALLY TAKES FOR MUTUAL AID TO KICK IN pAND IT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALSO DONE -- I SERVED IN THE EOC AND SANTA ROSA DURING THAT INCIDENT AS WELL. AS A AS A VOLUNTEER WOULD NOT UNDER MUTUAL AID. AND SET SOME OF THE THINGS MOVING FOR THAT WERE LOOKING AT ARE OBVIOUSLY THE BACKUP POWER NOT ONLY FOR SIGNALS BUT FOR THE CELL TOWERS. AND HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO MANDATE THE CELL COMPANIES TO DO THAT -- WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND PURCHASE NOT ONLY LAY ONLINE DATA THAT ALSO SELL -- DATA FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS A CELL. NUMBER REGISTERED IN OUR AREA -- WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED IN AND SIGNED UP TO BE ABLE TO SEND OUT THE WE ARE ALERTS LIKE THE AMBER ALERTS TYPICALLY THOSE ARE SENT THROUGH THE COUNTY -- BUT NOW WE AS A CITY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- AND LOOKING TO BUILD A MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITY -- PASSING ORDINANCES THAT ADDRESS LANDSCAPING INFLAMMABLE LANDSCAPING -- ENCOURAGING THE USE OF RESILIENT BUILDING MATERIALS -- AND HOPEFULLY -- BEING BETTER PREPARED OF MOVING FORWARD SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY OR PROVIDE ANY MORE INFORMATION AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR EXTENDED AN INVITATION TO JOIN YOU ALL HERE IN SACRAMENTO TODAY. MY NAME IS MICHAEL GUSMAN AND THE DEPUTY COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR IN CINEMA COUNTY AND ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF OUR OFFICE OF RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE COUNTY OF CINEMA TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK COUNTIES ARE DOING ACROSS THE STATE. TO BE MORE RESILIENT AND PREPARED FOR WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS IN THE FUTURE. THE STATE WIDER ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PREPARING FOR TOMORROW'S COMING DISASTERS SADLY TOO MANY OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE. BEEN DEVASTATED BY A DISASTER INCLUDING WILDFIRES FLOODS SMASH SHOOTINGS MUD SLIDES JUST TO NAME A FEW. AT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IS BEING INFORMED BY RECENT EXPERIENCES FROM DISASTERS AND COUNTIES ARE LEARNING FROM ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCES. C. SACK -- HAS FORMED A STATEWIDE RESILIENCY ADVISORY BOARD WERE STAFF FROM ALL DEPARTMENTS HAS A NETWORK TO LEARN EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND CONNECT ON HOW THEY'RE COUNTY IS BECOMING MORE PREPARED AND RESILIENT TO FUTURE DISASTERS. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CINEMA COMPLEX FIRES -- WAS AT THE TIME THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND ACRES WERE BURNED. FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED HOMES WERE DESTROYED THAT MEANT SANTA ROSA BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN THE BAY AREA. AND TWENTY FOUR LIVES WERE TRAGICALLY LOST IN THOSE FIRES. AND WHILE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO AND ARE MAKING WE ARE MAKING LARGE STRIDES TO TOWARD A FULL RECOVERY. AND WE ARE EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL TO OUR STATE LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION FOR THEIR INVALUABLE SUPPORT NOW BECAUSE SEE TO THAT AND A RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT ABOUT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMES BUT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE SHOULD BE ABOUT HALFWAY DONE WITH REBUILD SO WE'RE MAKING REALLY GOOD PROGRESS BUT SURVIVOR STILL FACE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES TO REBUILD. SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO INSURANCE INSURANCE REFORM IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO OFFER SURVIVORS THE CONFIDENCE THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IT'LL BE PRICED COMPETITIVELY. EARLY THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS AND FOR SOME THERE'S LITTLE CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL BE INSURABLE IN THE FUTURE. WELL THE COUNTY WAS STILL TACKLING ALL THE ISSUES THAT COME WITH A DISASTER OF THIS SCALE INCLUDING DEBRIS MANAGEMENT WATERSHED PROTECTION HOUSING THE VULNERABE. WE EMBARKED ON A YEAR LONG PROCESS INFORMED BY COUNTLESS COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO DEVELOP A RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK. IDENTIFIED IN THIS FRAMEWORK WAS -- WAS THE THREAT OF DEAD AND DYING TREES IN OUR FORESTS AND WHAT THEY ARETHE THREAT THEY'RE MAKING TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AND FUELS REDUCTION AND BUILDING A RESILIENT LANDSCAPE. ANOTHER GOAL IDENTIFIED WAS A PROGRAM THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE THROUGH INSURANCE REBATES AND OR DISCOUNTS TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES TO WILD FIRE THROOP WHETHER IT'S THROUGH STEEL ROUGHS. OR SEALED SOFFITS AND AT AND ROUGH FENCE -- THE RIGHT KIND OF VEGETATION THE RIGHT KIND OF LANDSCAPING. AND THE COUNTY IS ALSO INSTALLED SIX NEW FIRE CAMERAS THAT HELP PAINT A FULL PICTURE TO PROVIDE EARLIEST POSSIBLE WARNING OF FIRES TO RESIDENTS AND TO PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF THESE CAMERAS COULD PROVIDE EXPONENTIAL BENEFITS TO WHAT THESE LOCAL SYSTEMS CAN DO INDEPENDENTLY -- THAT'S ALL I HAVE AN EIGHT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT MATTER AT THE COUNTY CINEMA WANTS TO CONTINUE AND PARTNER WITH STATE ON A MERCY PREPAREDNESS AND SPECIFICALLY ON WILDFIRES. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TRACY RAKES I COUNTY MINISTRY FOR THE COUNTY OF TO WOLLEMI. AND WANT TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND I'VE IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE ALSO BE REPRESENTING OUR WORLD COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T A DUPLICATE MY COLLEAGUES HERE SAID BECAUSE OF ALL OF US I THINK ARE WORKING ON THE SAME ISSUES -- I WAS LOOKING AT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN OUT TO ME BY RC RC AND AND REALLY GOT ME THINKING REACHED OUT TO SOME OF OUR OTHER COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS. AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT YOU'RE RURAL COUNTIES FACE IN DEALING WITH WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS AND DEALING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES ARE RESOURCES. SO MELT MOST OF US FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE I BECAME THE COUNTY MINISTRY -- FOR SIX TO SEVEN YEARS I WAS THE ONLY S. COORDINATOR AT THE SAME TIME I WAS THE DEPUTY AND THEN ASSISTING COUNTY MINISTRY -- DOING BUDGET COORDINATION AT THE SAME TIME. SO YOU'RE RURAL COUNTIES ARE COUNTY IS MADE UP OF 75% PUBLIC LANDS IT JUST MAKES IT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT EVEN TRYING GENERATE REVENUES. BUT WHAT I DID WANT TO GO OVER IS EASY FOR COUNTIES WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE WE HAVE A VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH CAL FIRE IN CALLAWAY YES THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN GREAT PARTNERS WITH THOSE THEY'VE HELPED US TO COME A LONG WAY BILL THREE DROUGHT. AND THEN THREE TREE MORTALITY THINK WE WE REMOVED JUST ON COUNTY EFFORTS OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND TREES BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW ALL OF US AND WE ARE FORMING A REGIONAL WORK GROUP FOR THEIR SIX OF US -- SIX COUNTIES TOGETHER COMING TOGETHER FORM A PLAN. IS REALLY ABOUT FEELS REDUCTION ON PRIVATE PROPERTIES WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FOREST MANAGERS AND OUR SUPERVISOR TO ALONG THOSE HOME IN THOSE PRIVATE PROPERTIES BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND WE'VE DONE A SERIES OF EIGHT COMMUNITY MEETINGS AN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION WITH OUR OWN NETWORK. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE DON'T HAVE A MOST THIS IS WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE ALL OF THIS GREEN WASTE WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT WHEN WE BRING IT IN AND NOT ONLY THAT. OR OVER THAT DOESN'T SOUND BAD WE GET 265% AND THAT'S 40% SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER IS 40% OF OUR POPULATION. THEY HAVE LIMITED INCOME THEY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS AND THEY NEED A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY EXECUTIVES WE HAVE -- WORKING GROUP AS WELL WE CREATED THIS A WHITE PAPER ON POLICY THAT WILL BE -- PUT OUT BOTH TO ALL OF OUR STATE AGENCIES AND PARTNERS HERE VERY SOON THAT IS SOMETHING IT'S JUST ABOUT FINAL -- I'M TRYING TO THE INSURANCE IS AN ISSUE FOR ALL OF US I MEAN OUT MY OWN STAFF I HAVE ASSISTING COUNTY MINISTRY -- HR DIRECTOR CANCEL WITHOUT ANY REASON. WHEN I BECAME THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR IN JANUARY I HAVE MY ASSISTANT HAS BEEN REACHING OUT ON A WEEKLY BASIS TRYING TO GET A MEETING WITH OUR NEW INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WE'VE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL SO FAR BUT I KNOW I OUR WORK GROUP AND ALL OF THE COUNTY EXECUTIVES ARE ALSO LOOKING? FOR A WAY THAT WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEM IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEELS REDUCTION WORK THAT WE CAN DO TO MAYBE CREATE A NEW SYSTEM -- THE OTHER THING WE HAVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE EMERGENCIES FOR YOUR RURAL COUNTIES EVEN SOMETIMES COMING UP WITH A MATCH IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS MEAN. FOR US THE COUNTY OF TO ONLY AYE RESERVES ARE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT A CATASTROPHIC EVENT YOU COULD DEPLETE THOSE AND THEN WE YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS THAT YOUR SENSUALLY STOP PROVIDING SERVICES SO. WHEN WE LOOK AT REGULATING ENFORCING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT WHEN WE WENT OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY BEEN WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND? WHAT THAT MEANS IS IS WEAK? AND I KNOW THE EL DORADO COUNTY JUST PAST VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN IT'S A GREAT PLAN. BUT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW DO YOU HELP YOUR HOMEOWNERS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AND WHAT WE FOUND LOCALLY IS EVEN WHEN CAL FIRE DOES THEIR FIRE SAFETY INSPECTIONS. WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE GET THEIR CITATIONS THEY GO TO COURT THEY PAY THEIR CITATION AND MANY TIMES THEY DON'T GO BACK AND DO THE WORKS WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN PARTNER WITH OUR HOMEOWNERS? TO REDUCE pSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE SIRENS AS WELL OUR IDEA OF THE SIRENS IS REALLY NOT FOR EVACUATIONS BUT BY. HANDING OUT BATTERY OPERATED RADIOS AT THE SAME TIME IT'S REALLY AN EDUCATION. FOR WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT YOUR PHONE LINES ARE WORKING TUNE TO THE THEM. YOU CAN TUNE IN ON YOUR BATTERY OPERATED RADIO AND GET THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION SO WE'RE ALSO TRYING. TO BUT THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE AND AND IT'S HARD TO PUT THOSE IN A REAL COMMUNITY HERE WITH THE TOMOGRAPHY IT BREAKS EVEN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT SO. I GUESS. OUR MESSAGE FOR US IS IS RESOURCES IT'S A DIFFICULT AND WHILE WE PARTNER AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS SOMETIMES -- ASSISTING OUR HOMEOWNERS TO BECOME COMPLIANT IS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE MEANS TO DO IT. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR REALLY THOUGHTFUL TESTIMONY LITERALLY ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION I HAD ALREADY LAID OUT. SO -- I WILL BEGIN BY AND IS SAYING IT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING I WENT ON A RECENT VISIT TO BACK TO MY HOME STATE OF INDIANA WHERE THEY ARE TORNADO PRONE. AND STILL USE SIRENS BECAUSE THEY WERE THE MOST. EFFECTIVE MEANS THAT NEAR DOESN'TSHUT DOWN CAN BE RUN FROM A GENERATOR -- VERY LOUD SO CERTAINLY LOUD ENOUGH FOR AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO BE ALERTED AND POST WE'LL SEE AN AND THOMAS RECENTLY IN SAND FIRE MY INTERACTIONS WITH -- YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY WAS CONCERNS AROUND EFFECTIVE EVACUATION. AND FOLKS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING PERHAPS THAT TRAFFIC LAWS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD DEFINITELY CHANGE AND FIRST RESPONDERS NEED THEM TO TO MOVE IN AN ORDERLY FLOW. MALIBU OF COURSE BEING AT THAT KIND OF RARE EXCEPTION WHERE THE INGRESS AND EGRESS IS PRETTY LIMITED. IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT AND I FIND MYSELF WONDERING IF PERHAPS WE ARE IN A TIME WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN A SERIES OF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AROUND THAT VERY ISSUE SO THAT COMMUNITIES ARE INFORMED -- THROUGH MEANS THAT THEY REGULARLY ACCESS WHETHER IT'S SOCIAL MEDIA OR TELEVISION I'M. ABSOLUTELY POINTS HEARD AND TAKEN ON THE INSURANCE MARKET -- WE HAVE FOLKS EVEN IN MY COMMUNITIES I'M A YOU KNOW THE URBAN INTERFACE AREA WHERE. THEY'RE BEING NON RENEWED AND THEY HAVEN'T EVEN EXPERIENCED FIRE RECENTLY -- BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EFFECTIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY PERFORMING DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT -- AND DOES LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEED MORE TOOLS TO ASSIST PRIVATE LANDOWNERS -- TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY AS AT WHAT'S YOUR POINT. I WOULD THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN CINEMA COUNTY RECENTLY INVESTED IN PROGRAMS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO DO INSPECTIONS. BUT EVEN AT THAT RATE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US FIVE YEARS SO A CYCLE OF FIVE YEARS TO HIT EVERY HOME AND THAT'S ONLY REALLY IN THE LOCAL RESPONSE AREA. AND IF YOU LOOK AT A MAP OF CINEMA COUNTY IT'S 90% STATE RESPONSE AREA SO WE'RE VERY CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND THE REALITY IS IS FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OAKLAND ANOTHER JURISDICTIONS INSPECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT. IS THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO BE COMPLIANCE -- WITH A DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THE OUTCOME IS THAT IS LESS FIRE SYSTEM. I'M DEFINITELY AND THEN IN TERMS -- ECHOING -- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO ONLY COUNTY SAID GETTING THE RESOURCES INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT WE'VE GONE A LONG TIME WITHOUT? REALLY SEEN WHAT A HEALTHY FOREST LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS BUT THAT'S NOT IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE THINNED OUT THE DEAD AND DYING TREES NEED TO BE ELIMINATED. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GONA CAM KEEPERS A COMMUNITY SAFE ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE IN THE MOVIE. I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SAYING AT THE RESOURCESIS DEFINITELY THE ISSUE WE DO -- AND I WOULD SAY MOST OUR FIRE DISTRICTS ARE ALL ENGAGE THEY ARE ALL DOING THE FIRING -- INSPECTIONS. AND THAT'S IN PARTNERSHIP ALSO WITH WHAT CAL FIRE DOES. IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH WE MAYBE GET 215% OF THE IMPROVE PARCELS IN THE YEAR AND THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME GOING BACK AND TRYING TO BRING THOSE HOMES IN THE COMPLIANCE. SO THE THE RESOURCES SIMPLY AREN'T THERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT THE RESOURCES AT THE BOARD LEVEL FOR THEM TO INVEST IN TO DO TWENTY SO I MEAN FOR US IT'S ONLY MAYBE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PARCELS. BUT THAT'S A LOT OF INSPECTIONS IN A SINGLE YEAR -- BUT AND RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THEM PROBABLY 60% OF THEM PROBABLY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. AND SO IT'S PUTTING EVERYONE ELSE AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THAT. SAID THE CITY OF MALIBU IS A CONTRACT CITY SO WE CONTRACT WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR A FIRE SERVICES AND THEY OVERSEE. AND IN FORCE THE BRUSH CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS -- BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IS WE JUST HIRED AT A FIRE SAFETY POSITION ON A ON THAT PERSON WILL WORK ON BEHALF OF THE CITY. AND ASSIST OUR RESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR BRUSH CLEARANCE -- HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT'S THE ONLY SOLUTION ON THE WALLS THE FIRE -- WAS AT THE WINDS THAT DAY WERE WERE INCREDIBLE AND THE FIRE WAS FRONTING TWO MILES AHEAD OF ITSELF SO WE HAD EMBERS -- FAR AHEAD OF THE FRONT OF THE FIRE -- LANDING ON ROOFS AND WE'VE HEARD STORY AFTER STORY OF WOOD CHIPS CATCHING ON FIRE OF PEOPLE WHO USE RAILROAD TIES IN THEIR LANDSCAPING. I'M CATCHING ON FIRE SO IT IS ONE SOLUTION BUT I'M DEFINITELY. NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION ON AND THEN WHILE I AM HAVE MY THE MIKE I DID WANT TO JUST MENTION BECAUSE I NOTICE NONE OF US DID -- TO TALK ABOUT THE FLOOD AFTER FIRE ISSUE WHICH OBVIOUSLY -- WAS A BIG ISSUE FOR THE THOMAS FIRE AREA AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WERE CHALLENGED WITH SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT OF SOMETHING NOT TO BE LAUGHED AT NOT TO DISCUSS THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY ALL -- WONDERFUL POINTS I APPRECIATE OUR THOUGHTFUL TESTIMONY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU PLEASE STAY IN TOUCH WITH US. HAS NEEDS ARISE PARTICULARLY AS WE APPROACH -- YOU KNOW ANOTHER SEASON BUT I WE ANYWAY. THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS WE APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TRIP HERE AT TO TEST FIND JOIN US THANK YOU. OKAY NOW WE WILL INVITE. OUR NEXT PANEL -- TO JOIN US. CHIEF. ANTHONY GOZER CITY OF SANTA ROSA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS. CAPTAIN MIKE FACE CITY OF SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO AREA FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL FIVE TWO TWO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WELCOME GENTLEMEN AND YOU MAY BEGIN AS YOU'RE READY. HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TONY GOSSAMER FROM THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY SANTA ROSA. AND I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER BOARD ADDRESS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. CAL CHIEFS HAS ENGAGED IN A VERY HIGH LEVEL ON THE IMPACTS OF WALL FIRE AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER STATE. IN OUR STATE AND HAS BEEN COORDINATING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY FOR MANY YEARS IN THE AREA OF PREVENTION. RESPONSE MITIGATION AND RECOVERY. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS JOINT LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON WILD FIRE. THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR STATE -- BEEN FAR REACHING. AND HAS -- AS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS FIRES ARE BURNING WITH GREATER FEROCITY AND DO MORE DAMAGE THAN EVER BEFORE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF WILD FIRE AND SOME ESTIMATES INDICATE OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- IN PROPERTY LOSS AT THE SAME TIME PERIOD. UNFORTUNATELY I PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON THE IMPACTS WALL FIRE FOR OUR STATE. IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A FIRE KNOWN AS THE TUBS FIRE DEVASTATED MY COMMUNITY. TWENTY TWO OF THE HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE THAT DIED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE VICTIMS OF THE TUBS FIRE. THE TUBS FIRE STARTED IN THE COUNTY OF NAPA AND IN A FOUR HOUR PERIOD UNDER HEAVY WINDS BURN TWELVE MILES. TO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. ULTIMATELY BURNING THE FOUNTAIN GROVE IN COFFEE PARK AREAS OF MY CITY. ULTIMATELY -- EXCUSE ME IN TOTAL THE TUBS FIRE BURNED AND DESTROYED FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SIX STRUCTURES. APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED OF THOSE STRUCTURES WERE LOCATED THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. THE TIME HAS COME FOR MEANINGFUL AND REALISTIC CHANGES THAT FIRST HELP TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IN WHEN THEY OCCUR TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THEM QUICKLY AND KEEP THEM SMALLER AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS. TO LIFE PROPERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE AGENCIES PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STATE RESPONSE TO THESE WILDFIRE DISASTERS. IN FACT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE RESOURCES DEPLOYED TO MOST LARGE SCALE WALL FIRE INCIDENTS IN OUR STATE. ALL WHILE FIRE INCIDENTS ARE LOCAL. WHEN THAT LOCAL AMHERST BECOMES TOO LARGE FOR THE LOCAL PUBLIC CITIES -- SAFETY RESOURCES TO HANDLE THE TAP IN THE CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THROUGH. THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. WHETHER A FIRE STARTS. LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY AREA LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCE RESPOND WHEN REQUESTED HELP MITIGATE THE EMERGENCY THROUGH SUPPRESSION FORCES. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT. INCIDENT SUPPORT IN THROUGH RECOVERY. THAT'S ABOUT NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR AS CALLOW YESES CORNER PHRASE ONE TEAM. ONE FIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES DEPLOY THESE LARGE SCALE EVENTS THE RESPONDENT AGENCIES REIMBURSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT ON THE MUTUAL AID. THAT WAS REQUESTED IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY IS MADE WHOLE OR NEAR HOLE FOR THE MONEY SPENT IN SENDING RESOURCES. TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT BY THE H. D. REQUESTING MUTUAL AID IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT AGENCIES WILL ARE WILLING TO SEND MUTUAL AID. RESOURCES TO ANY INCIDENT. WITHOUT TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY BUDGETS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND A TAXPAYERS OF THAT COMMUNITY WOULD NOT SUPPORT THE CONTINUED RESPONSE OUTSIDE THEIR JURISDICTION UNDER THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. AGENCIES AGENCIES ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN A RESPONSE READINESS AT HOME AS WELL. NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN SEND SO MANY RESOURCES. THAT THEY CANNOT MANAGE EMERGENCIES AT HOME. THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS BASED ON LOCAL MERCIES DRAWN DOWN OR HOME RESOURCES BY 25%. TO ACCEPT DEPLOYMENTS TO DISASTERS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THIS MEANS MORE LONGER HOURS FOR STAFF WHO REMAIN WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES TO HANDLE EVERYDAY EMERGENCIES. WHICH CAN EXPOSE THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO ADDED FATIGUE AND STRESS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF LONGER MORE FREQUENT DEPLOYMENTS. WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF HOME. LAST YEAR FIRE MANAGEMENT LABOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS MADE THE CASE THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD. IT NEEDED TO BE STRENGTHENED AND MODERNIZE TO COMBAT THE NEW NORMAL -- NEW NORMAL OF FIRE SHE IS THAT WE ARE NOW CONFRONTING YEAR AFTER YEAR. IN MY COMMUNITY WE LEARN AT A VERY DIFFICULT LESSON THAT ARE MUTUALLY SYSTEM AS GREAT AS IT IS. TAKES TOO LONG TO SUMMON HELP TO SAVE LIVES AND HOMES AND THE INITIAL HOURS OF A DISASTER. IN A TUBS FIRE EVERYTHING WAS BURNED IN JUST A FEW HOURS. IN OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE CANNOT WAIT TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR HELP. FORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PROOF FUNDING TO PRE POSITION LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES THROUGH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. DURING HIGH RISK CONDITIONS FOR WILDFIRES. AS WELL AS FLOODS AND DEBRIS FLOWS. POSITIONING PUTS MORE RESOURCES ON HIGH ALERT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND READY TO PLAY IMMEDIATELY WONDERED BUT DISASTER STRIKES. DURING THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE GAINED VALUABLE EXPERIENCE. ABOUT HOW TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE PRE POSITIONING AS A STRATEGY. WE'RE PLEASE A GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS PROPOSED CONTINUE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE MADE IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. INCLUDING MODERNIZING OUR RESOURCE ORDERING SYSTEM. GPS LOCATION TECHNOLOGY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGINES AVAILABLE FOR STATEWIDE MUTUALLY DEPLOYMENTS. AND ADDED DISPATCH AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP US REDUCE OUR REFLECTS TIME. TO DISASTERS AND PROVIDE INCIDENT MANAGERS WITH BETTER REAL TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND LOCATION OF RESOURCES. ARRIVING FROM MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. WE CAN ALSO TAP INTO THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO MONITOR FOR FIRE STARKS. THE UTILITY INDUSTRY IS USING SOME OF THE MOST STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY. AND MAY HAVE MAY BE A GOOD PARTNER IN THIS AREA. COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION -- IN THE LOCAL. FUSION CENTERS WITH MULTIPLE STAKE STAKEHOLDERS PARTITION OF PARTICIPATION WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO LEVERAGE OUR RESOURCES AND MAKE AN IMPACT. ON A WILDFIRE AREA. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS AT ALL LEVELS TO PLACE THE SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS AS A TOP PRIORITY. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL AND BOARDS WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL STATE OFFICIALS. ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE A MERCY PLANS THAT EVALUATE RISK. POTENTIAL TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND PLANS TO MITIGATE THAT RISK. RISKS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY AND A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS NOT EFFECTIVE. THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH THE LOCAL LOOKED AT OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TO MAKE WHAT WILL OFTEN BE UNPOPULAR DECISIONS. TO MITIGATE THE RISK POTENTIAL FOR THE COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE A MERCY PLANS PROPER GROWTH PLANNING FIRE PREVENTION PLANS AN AGGRESSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS TO MEDICATE THE UNIQUE. RISKS THAT COMMUNITY. WHAT SEATS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISH IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THESE MEASURES ARE STRICTLY FOLLOWED? THESE EFFORTS ARE OFTEN RESISTED BY LOCAL HOMEOWNERS BUT THE EFFORT TO MITIGATE THE RISK THE RISK IS A RIGHT JUST. ONE IN A WILL TAKE COURAGE TO ESTABLISH HIS LIFESAVING PRACTICES WITH THE CURRENT CLIMATE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. CERTAINLY THE WILD. LAND URBAN INTERFACE OR IN A RURAL AREAS WHERE THE RISK IS HIGHER DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BUILDING HARDENING. AMONG OTHER EFFECTIVE RISK MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PROPERTY DAMAGE AND LOSS OF LIFE. REGIONAL COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION ON THESE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION PLANS IS IMPORTANT ALSO. MOST OF THESE LARGE SCALE EVENTS IMPACT MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND INVOLVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES -- THROUGHOUT ALL GOVERNMENT. THE RESPONSIBILITY ALSO LIES WITH THE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO PREVENT FIRES BY AVOIDING AT RISK ACTIVITIES. TO HAVE EMERGENCY PLANS FOR THEIR FAMILY AND KNOW THE EVACUATION ROUTES ESTABLISHED FOR THE AREAS. AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE ARE GRANT PROGRAMS OFFERED TO CAL -- YES IN CAL FIRE IN ALLOCATE MONEY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REDUCE RISK IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. INCLUDING A MERCY PLAN DEVELOPMENT. FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AMONG OTHERS. THE STATE NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS AND THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE IN THIS CHANGING CLIMATE ENVIRONMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN ONE HIGH RISK REDUCTION PRACTICES ARE PLAN IN PLACE. WE STILL HAVE A RISK OF FIRE AND OTHER EMERGENCIES I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY OF FOUND GROVE WAS A FAR WISE COMMUNITY. WHAT A ONE WARDS FOR THEIR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WE LOST 85% OF THE HOMES THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FIRE AND THE WINDS CAME TOWARDS IT? AND AND COFFEE PARK IS NOT EVEN IN A WHILE AND URBAN INTERFACE AND WE LOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES AHEAD OF CLIMATE DRIVEN EVENT TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO ADDRESS THE MERCY AND KEEP THE INCIDENT SMALL. THE IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AYE ALLEN EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE BETTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SO THAT WHEN. AN EMERGENCY OCCURS WE'LL BE ABLE -- TO BETTER LOCATE THE CLOSEST AND MOST OF PROPER RESOURCES FOR RESPONSE IN THE DISPATCH CENTER TO GET THE RESOURCES DEPLOYED QUICKLY. CAL CHIEF STANDS READY TO BE AN INTRAPARTY THE TEAM WORKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WALL FIRE IN OUR STATE. WE HOLD THIS EFFORT AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES. CALIFORNIA'S EXPECT AND DESERVE BETTER THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THE CAPTAIN MIKE FIVE WITH SEGMENTS CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT I'M ALSO PROUD MEMBER SACRAMENTO AREA FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL FIVE TWO TWO AS WELL AS THE I FF INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS TENTH DISTRICT. BURN COORDINATOR. AS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SEGMENT OF FIRE DEPARTMENT OR SENT OUT TO DO BATTLE WITH WILDFIRES. WE KNOW THE MANY FACTORS THAT CREATE HIGH RISK FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRES. THIS PAST YEAR WAS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE DID WILD FIRES ON RECORD AND WE SEEM TO BE SAYING THAT EVERY YEAR NOW. WE EXPECT THIS YEAR TO BE NO DIFFERENT. THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS OUR NEW NORMAL. WHAT USED TO BE A ONCE IN A CAREER WILDFIRE IS NOW PAR FOR THE COURSE FOR FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS THE STREET? STATE EXCUSE ME AS I AS I STARTED MY CAREER IN THIS DEPARTMENT IT WAS VERY RARE THAT WE EVER RESPONDED TO WILD FIRES. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS I RESPONDED AT LEAST TWO TO THREE TIMES IN A SEASON NOW. SO UNFORTUNATELY IT'S PUTTING MORE OF OUR MEMBERS AT RISK. WE USED TO WE CAN'T CONTROL MOTHER NATURE WE CAN WITH THE RATES RESOURCES WE CAN BE PREPARED AND MORE EFFECTIVE IN BATTLING THESE WILD FIRES. THE PILLAR WILDFIRE RESPONSES ARE MUTUALLY SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S MODEL MUTUAL AID NETWORK DEPENDS ON LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS COLLABORATING TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO MAJOR DISASTERS INCLUDING WILDFIRES. LOCAL AGENCY FIRE RESPONSE IS THE BACKBONE TO THE MUTUAL AID AND BECOMING MORE INDISPENSABLE IN OUR NEW NORMAL. AS LOCAL AGENCY RESPONDER STRUGGLE WITH TIGHTER BUDGETS DANGEROUSLY HIGH THREAT LEVELS ARE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THERE MUST BE AN INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL TO ADEQUATELY STAFFED APARTMENT SO WE BE SO THAT WE ARE PREPARED WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. SACRAMENTO CURRENTLY IS IT MANDATORY STAFFING ALMOST EVERY DAY NOW WE STILL HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM THE RECESSION AND ARE BATTLING THOSE ISSUES. SO ANYTIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE LARGE SCALE INCIDENTS IT DRAWS DOWN OUR LOCAL RESOURCES AND WERE UNABLE TO ACTUALLY RESPOND TO QUITE A FEW EMERGENCIES. AND HAVE TO CONTINUALLY BROWN OUT OUR OWN STATIONS HERE WHICH PUTS THE CITIZENS OF SACRAMENTO AT RISK. OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE STAFFING AND THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO WILDFIRES PART WELL FAR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE IS PREVENTION EFFORTS. FORCE MITIGATION AND FUEL REDUCTION IS KEY TO MANAGING WILDFIRES AND PREVENTING THEM FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. LAND USE POLICIES ALSO VITAL TO PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION. IN THE AFTERMATH OF EVERY MAJOR FIRE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION ON SMALLER FIXES THE FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS. BUILDING MATERIALS DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROPER EGRESS TEMPORARY REFUGE AND SO FORTH. BUT CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE TO ACCOUNT FOR RISK FACTORS. THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN AN AREA THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE POTENTIAL FUEL LOADS PREVIOUS FIRE HISTORY AND WEATHER EVENTS. THESE MORE EXPENSIVE RISK FACTORS CAN'T BE VIEWED AS STRICTLY LOCAL ISSUES. THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND THE COST OF THESE DISASTERS IS LARGELY BORNE BY ALL OF US. IN THIS NEW ABNORMAL CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAND USE POLICY TAKE THESE RISK FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT NEW DEVELOPMENT. IN THE WOMB WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER HIGH RISK AREAS. BUT WE MUST ALSO LOOK AT EXISTING DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER THE YEARS WITH LITTLE INTERVENTION. WHILE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE FIRE IN PARADISE WAS BEYOND MEASURE. WE KNOW THAT THE TOWN WAS DEVELOPED HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE PERSPECTIVE WAS FOR DIFFERENT. WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND LOCAL ZONING AND CONSIDER THE BIGGER PICTURE. VIEW LOADING LOCATION ROADS IN AND OUT IGNITION SOURCES AND OTHER CASUAL FACTORS. ONLY THEN CAN WE DECIDE ISSUES SUCH AS SPACING ROADS AND STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION. OF COURSE. NO ONE SET OF PRESCRIPTIONS IS FOOL PROOF IF YOU LOOK AT THE SANTA ROSA FIRES AT THE CHIEFS WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. THEIR ALREADY WIDE ROADS PLENTY OF EGRESS AND IN MANY CASES MORE MODERN MATERIALS. EVEN HERE THESE EXPERIENCES SHOULD OFFER A ROADMAP. AS WE LOOK TO REBUILD. AS TO THE STATE'S ROLE IN PREVENTION FIRST AND FOREMOST IT REQUIRES A REALISTIC AND MORE CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRE RISK IN THE STATE AND ALL ITS COMMUNITIES -- FIRES MAPS -- UNDERGOING REVISION BUT THE LAW ONLY REQUIRES CAL FIRE TO PUBLISH DATA ON VERY HIGH A FIRE HAZARD SAFETY ZONES. WHEN YOU OVER IDENTIFY PEOPLE BECOME NUMB TO THE RISK IN OTHER AREAS LIKE HIGH -- MODERATE FAR HAS HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THE CAL FIRE MAP BUT IN MANY CASES LOCALS DON'T COMPLY AND PENALTIES ARE SIGNIFICANT. THESE LAWS NEED MORE TEETH. FINALY AND MOST EGGS SIGNIFICANTLY IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PRACTICAL ISSUES ALONG WILD FIRE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. BUT IT'S AN INVISIBLE COST IT'S REALLY DISCUSSED IS FAR BETTER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IN THIS NEW NORMAL FIREFIGHTERS ARE WAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. DEPLOYED MORE OFTEN AND COME ACROSS. WELL WAY TOO MANY DEATHS. IN THE CASE OF THE CAMPFIRE. EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES UP THERE AND MORE FIREFIGHTERS WERE AFFECTED BY THOSE ISSUES THEN I THINK WE'RE TRULY IDENTIFIED. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID -- WHILE WE WERE UP THERE WAS CAL FIRE DID A GREAT JOB THEY'VE THEY'VE STARTED PROVIDING THEIR EMERGENCY SIR. SERVICE SUPPORT UNIT WHICH IS THERE TO INTERVENE IN SOME OF THESE CASES. BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO DO MORE -- AS A LOT OF THESE FIREFIGHTERS AT WORK IN THESE COMMUNITIES. THOSE ARE THEIR NEIGHBORS THAT ARE KILLED. AND A LOT OF THEM HAD TO RESPOND AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE SEARCH TEAMS THAT WERE WORKING IN THOSE AREAS. AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM AS THEY WATCH THEIR NEIGHBOR HERB IT'S BURNED DOWN THEY BATTLE THE WILDFIRE FOR WEEKS AND WERE PART OF THE BODY RECOVERY PROCESS. FACING THAT KIND OF TRAGEDY CAN BE TO LARGER BURDEN FOR ANYBODY THAT'S WHY PEER SUPPORT IS SO VITAL TO FIRST RESPONDERS. WE SAW THIS WORK BEST AT THE CAMPFIRE WITH THE GROUND PEER SUPPORT SERVICES. FROM ONE FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED AND WITNESSED WITH OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS AND TRAINED PERSONNEL. CURRENTLY IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO LIMA BAY WILL HEALTH COORDINATOR FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. AND THE WE ARE SLOWLY RECOVERING ARE REALIZING THAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER SO I'D LIKE TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE FORTY TWO AS WE GO FOR BECAUSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED. TO ARM OURSELVES WITH LOCALLY TO MAKE SOME OF THESE CHANGES AND THE THE CARE AND WELL BEING OF OUR MEMBERS. HOW THE FIREFIGHTERS? IS BEING BEYOND JUST WHAT IS PHYSICAL IN IS THE KEY TO WORK THAT WE DO. THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T ANYONE ANSWER ON HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THE NEXT -- SUPPORT PREVENT NEXT BIG WILD FIRE. BUT WITH MEANINGFUL CHANGES WE CAN TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TOWARDS BEING BETTER PREPARED AND EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO THE CHANGING NATURE OF WILDFIRES AND PROVIDE BETTER OTIONS FOR OUR FIREFIGHTERS. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL THE WOUNDS AND CONTINUE TO DO THE JOB THEY LOVE. WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO FIRE RESPONSE AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'D LIKE TO WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE JOINED US IN AT THIS TIME I WOULD OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND REALIZING THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE OR AT LEAST ON THE A STAFFING OF FIRE FIGHTING AND THEN ASK A QUESTION TO BOTH OF YOU. HIS ME ABOUT -- AGAIN LAST YEAR WE WE PASSED A NUMBER OF BILLS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU TALKED ABOUT OF VEGETATION CLEARING -- WORKING -- WE'RE DOING LEGISLATION THIS YEAR ON LAND USE I'M CURIOUS AS TO IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. ABOUT -- THE IMPACTS OF THE ABILITY. TO USE THESE NEW STATUTORY -- INCENTIVES IF YOU WILL A REQUIREMENT TO DO SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO LINK -- SO ASK YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN A BUT LET ME START WITH THE BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH ISSUE -- WE'RE SEEING A NUMBER OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN PARTICULAR FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE -- HAVING TROUBLE ADDRESSING THE HORROR THAT THEY'VE BEEN pTHROUGH BEING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES TO CHECK TRENCHING A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER OF THESE FOLKS. ACTUALLY COMMITTING SUICIDE. I'M WONDERING WHAT IF ANYTHING IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THIS -- IS PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO HAVE -- MORE FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE SO THAT THAT WE CAN REMOVE SOME OF SOME OF THESE FOLKS FROM -- THE FIELD DURING THESE FIRES GIVE THEM A LITTLE BREAK SOME FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FIRES FOR MONTHS I KNOW WITH THE THOMAS FIRE. IT STARTED IN DECEMBER WENT RIGHT THROUGH CHRISTMAS RIGHT THROUGH NEW YEARS SO PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES DURING YOU KNOW THESE VERY CRITICAL TIMES OF THE YEAR. WE HAD THE DEBRIS FLOW LOST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE IN. THERE COUPLE OF WHOM IS STILL NOT BEEN FOUND BUT FINDING THEIR BODIES AND IN VERY DIFFICULT STATES -- WE WAS PRETTY HORRIFIC TO A LOT OF THESE FOLKS AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IN RECOGNIZING. EIGHTY PEOPLE WHO BURNED TO DEATH AND SO FORTH WHAT WHAT KINDS OF STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN IF ANY. TO DEAL WITH THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE WORK THAT THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS -- TO SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE -- THIS YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THE CAMPFIRE I MEAN IT BEING SUCH A LARGE AND SAID BUT IT WAS PROBABLY SOME OF THE BEST WORK THAT I'D SEEN WITH THE EMERGENCY SUPPORT SERVICES UNIT THAT. ACTUALLY CAL FIRE HAS INTEGRATED INTO THEIR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THEY ALSO -- LEND MORE CREDENCE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT -- MEMBERS BEING AFFECTED BY -- SOME OF THE THE SEEING THE DESKS AS WELL AS THE FULL LENGTH OF TIME BEING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY LEAD UP. TO SOME OF THE STRUGGLES THAT WE DO SEE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE OF STUFF AND THEY ARE DRESSING THOSE. AND AND IT HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IT'S GETTING BETTER. BUT A THIRD THEY'RE STILL DOES THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK THAT'S DONE IT NEEDS TO BECOME MORE STATEWIDE LOCALLY HERE -- MY EXPERIENCES LAST YEAR WAS MORE IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION AND THEY DID A GREAT JOB AND AGAIN THEY WERE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THAT THE THE LEADERS IN THOSE -- TEAMS AND STUFF WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THEIR MEMBERS AND THEN THAT THEY EAT EMERGENCY SUPPORT UNISYS SERVICES EXCUSE ME. THEY WERE OUT THERE WORKING WITH PEOPLE ON THE LINE TALKING TO THOSE MEMBERS SO. WE'RE MAKING SOME OF THE RIGHT STEPS BUT WE DO NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES INTO ACTUALLY MAKING THAT A MORE ROBUST -- PROGRAM AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT IT'S STATEWIDE AND IT AND ACTUALLY ADDRESSES ALL THE MEMBERS -- THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION -- THAT THAT'S HELPFUL I I'M WONDERING ON THE OTHER -- ISSUE WHETHER YOU KNOW THE LESSONS LEARNED THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING NOW THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE ARE THEY ARE THEY HELPFUL ARE IT ARE THEY BEING ADOPTED DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM. WE DID IT AGAIN SB NINE A ONE SB TWELVE SIXTY A WHOLE BUNCH OF LEGISLATION TO TRY TO DO WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES YOU PHRASE. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE TRY TO DO WORK NOW AND YOU YOU MADE THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO PUT TEETH INTO THE LOCAL INPUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE MAPS. WHICH ARE AS I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED BUT I KNOW IN MY AREA WE'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM -- WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE ARE FOR FIRE SOMEONE'S ARE WE'RE OR DEBRIS FLOWS ON SORRY AND THIS IS A TOUGH CALL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FRICTION. THAT EXISTS BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU BOTH SEEN IF ANYTHING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE THAT THERE'D HAVE BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU PHRASE LIKE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SECTOR. YEAH ALL THESE -- ITEMS ARE COMING BEFORE US ARE GREAT -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN CHANGE IN THE LAST YEAR. IS THERE'S A LOT MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN EVERYONE -- WHILE THERE WAS ALWAYS GOOD CLAP YOUR COLLABORATION BETWEEN CAL FIRE AND YES AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES NOW WE'RE BRINGING UTILITIES INTO THAT. INTO THE MIX AND THAT IS ESSENTIAL WE CANNOT DO THIS BY OURSELVES -- THEY HAVE SOME OF THE MOST -- UP TO DATE. TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED TO LEVERAGE FOR THESE FUSION CENTERS THE INFORMATION EASE THE FLOW BACK AND FORTH. AS IS QUICK AS IT CAN TO HELP EACH OTHER MOVE FORWARD ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE EXPERIENCED IN OUR ON OUR FIRE -- BETWEEN SIX PM AND MIDNIGHT IN SANTA ROSA WE HAD TEN REPORTED STRUCTURE FIRES IN TWENTY REPORTED VEGETATION FIRES THAT WAS BEFORE THE TUBS FIRE EVEN CAME TO SANTA ROSA. IT HAS A ROSE UNTIL ONE O'CLOCK SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WHEN A FIRE STARTS IN ANOTHER COUNTY AND IS BURNING TOWARD ANYBODY. AND SO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS HUGE ALITALIA'S SONOMA COUNTY WE ALREADY WE HAVE FIFTEEN CAMERAS UP THANKS TO SOME COUNTY WATER P. JEANNIE AND SOME OTHERS -- SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AND WE HAVE THESE UP IN DISPATCH SO IF THAT THERE ARE A CALL COMES IN WE CAN LOOK PICKED THE CAMERA WERE WE THIS APPROPRIATE. YEP WE HAVE SMOKE IT HAPPENED TWICE LAST YEAR WELL WE ACTUALLY DIALED IN THE THE ACTUAL AREA IN CENTER PROPER RESOURCES AND THEN YOU CAN MONITOR HOW FAST IT'S GROWING. AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT FIRE. SO WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY TODAY THAT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH IS HELPFUL. AS FAR AS THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THAT HAS TO BE A REGIONAL APPROACH THERE'S NO ONE SINGLE SILVER BOWL OF THIS GOING TO FIX THIS. THIS IS A HUNDRED YEARS IN THE MAKING LAND USE HAS CHANGED -- I'LL TAKE AGAIN THE TUBS FIRE WE HAVE THE HANLEY FIRE WHICH BASICALLY IS THE SAME FOOTPRINT. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NUMBER LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED STRUCTURES MOST OF THOSE WERE BARNES MOST OF THE LAND WAS EITHER ORCHARD OR GRACED. WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW WE HAVE HOMES STODDARD EVERYWHERE AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GRAZING GOING ON SO YOU HAVE. MANY MANY YEARS OF VEGETATION GROWTH THAT WAS DEALT WITH ANOTHER WAY AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT NOW SO IT TAKES A REGIONAL APPROACH YOU HAVE TO BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AROUND YOU. THE LOCALITIES AROUND YOU THIS STATE EVERYONE HAS TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE. LIKE I SAID FONG ROSE A FAR AWAY AS COMMUNITY. EVERYTHING BELOW IT WAS NOT SO ONCE THAT CAUGHT ON FIRE AND JUST. JUST THROUGH AMBER'S EVERYWHERE. AND SOME OF THE HOUSES WERE HARD AND I WILL TELL YOU THE FIRE STATION THAT WE LOST WAS HARD IT WAS TWO YEARS OLD. IT WAS HARD IT DID NOT SURVIVE BECAUSE WE HAD FOUR FIVE HOMES ON FIRE AROUND IT. AND HARDENING DOES NOT. DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF HEAT FOR THAT KIND OF TIME IT'S MADE FOR GRASS AND BRUSH TO BURN THROUGH YOUR HOUSE OF SURVIVING AND KEEPS. KEEPS ON GOING ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH THAT AT THAT POINT. BUT WHEN THE HOUSE WHEN THERE'S HOUSES BURNING LIES HOUSES WERE HARD BECAUSE THEY'RE BUILT BEFORE SO WE NEED GRANTING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP PEOPLE HARD MATTER IN THE COMMUNITIES NOW -- TO HELP THEM MUCH LIKE WE HAVE EARTHQUAKE GRANTING FOR YOU KNOW -- TO HELP WITH THEIR THEIR HOMES FOR EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS. NOW SO THERE'S THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IT NEEDS TO BE A REGIONAL APPROACH. WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON HISTORICAL FIRES AND WHERE THERE IT WHERE THEY START AND WHERE THEY END UP I WILL TELL YOU THE HANLEY FAR THAT ARE REFERENCED BEFORE TO THREE TO FOUR DAYS TO GET TO SANTA ROSA. IT TOOK OUR HOURS ON IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WERE NOT PREPARED. FOR I WILL TELL YET. PROPONENT OF FIRE WISE COMMUNITIES IN SANTA ROSA WHAT THAT DOES IS IF THERE'S A FIRE THE STARS NOT COMMUNITY THAT GIVES US TIME TO GET THERE AS QUICK AS WE CANNOT CONTROL. RIGHT SO DOESN'TGET OUT OF CONTROL SO WE KEEP IT IN -- WE JUST DON'T WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LANDS AND LARGE PARCELS -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN THE VEGETATION AND THE STATE THAT IS. HELPFUL TO FIRE PREVENTION SOME CASES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH G. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE CHIEF COSTNER I I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TRIPS YOU MADE UP YOUR FROM SANTA ROSA SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I JUST APPRECIATE -- NOT ONLY OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT A GREAT INTEREST IN THIS BY YOUR DEDICATION -- TO THIS AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ANY OTHER COMMUNITIES. HI I AM -- YOU THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT -- YOU KNOW THIS. LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT -- AT HERE EVERYTHING IS ABOUT MITIGATION AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT -- FOR FINANCIAL BACKSTOPS FOR THIS TYPE OF THING -- IT'S A LONG ROAD. AND ROME WAS NOT BUILT OVERNIGHT WE SEE RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW IN THE CALIFORNIA FORCE MANAGEMENT SEE OUR OLD WOULD GO ON ALL THE TALK IN THE JEEP FOR ABOUT THIS -- YEAH WERE LOOKING AT I THINK A HALF MILLION ACRES IS YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT THE GOAL WAS. AND WE'RE FOLLOWING WAY SHORT OF THAT NOT BECAUSE NOBODY'S TRYING NOW BECAUSE OF ANY. HUMAN FAULT IT'S JUST IT TAKES TIME TO RAMP UP. YOU YOU MENTIONED -- ABOUT. THE TAKING A REGIONAL APPROACH AND I DO AGREE WITH THAT. BUT I I REALLY SEE THAT -- YOU ALLOW CAL FIRE MAY HAVE THIS YACHT MASTER PLAN IN THE FOREST EVERYTHING ELSE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU IN THE WILL? YOU KNOW WHILE AND URBAN INTERFACE AND WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER TO TRY TO SUPPORT. LET'S SAY FOR FIVE COUNTIES. YEAH WORKING TOGETHER WITH YEAH YEAH YEAH WITH THE STATE WHAT TYPE OF PLANTS. YOU KNOW CAN WE PUT TOGETHER TO HELP MITIGATE ANOTHER REAP OUT LIKE YOU WENT THROUGH IT -- ON OCTOBER EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO WHAT WE'RE JUST EMBARKING ON I WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GRANT OR YES FROM WHAT THE COME OUT -- COMMITTEE WELFARE PROTECTION PLAN THAT'S JUST FOR THE CITY SANTA ROSA THE COUNTY HAS A PLAN AS OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SONOMA COUNTY. BUT NURSE THIRTY FIVE DEPARTMENTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND SONOMA COUNTY RIGHT WHEN WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT. BUT EVERYONE HAS A LOCALITY EVERYONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY -- THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HOMEOWNERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY IN SOME AREAS IT'S IT'S REALLY HAS TO BE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. AND THE THE BIG THING THAT THAT I SEE IS WE HAVE A LACK OF RESOURCES MEANING MONEY. RIGHT SO WE HAVE IN SANTA ROSA WE HAVE AN INSPECTION BE A FIRE PREVENTION BUREAU WE HAVE -- SIX SIX FIRE INSPECTORS. BUT THEY'RE DEDICATED TO INSPECTING BUILDINGS THERE AND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SITES AND ALL THE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING THAT WE HAVE GOING ON SO AS WE TRY TO A SHOE HORN A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INTO MY COMMUNITY. THE THING THAT ALWAYS HOLD US BACK IS MONEY BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY DEDICATED TO THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T LET GO OF WE CAN'T STOP INSPECTING BUILDINGS WE HAVE TO BECAUSE THAT YOU LOSE A BUILDING DOWNTOWN. THAT TURNS INTO A BLOCK THAT TURNS INTO A THREE BLOCKS AS A HUGE HUGE ISSUE FOR A COMMUNITY SO YOU REALLY WE ARE TRYING TO REASON EVERY GRANTING OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST JUMPSTART OF EDUCATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. I KNOW THE COUNTY HAS IS STARTED A LIMITED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL AT ONCE SO YOU HAVE TO START WHERE THE HISTORY IS YOU HAVE TO START WHERE THE THE THE WHILE AND MEETS TO COMMUNITIES WEATHER'S. LARGE POPULATIONS -- AND YOU JUST KIND HAVE TO EAT THAT ALL ONE BITE AT A TIME BUT THE BIG THING FOR US YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE WITH IN THE CITY SANTA ROSA IS FUNDING. NOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET MORE MONEY TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND STILL KEEP THE CITY VIABLE. AT ALL CAN'T GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A WHOLE CITY TO RUN. SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE STRUGGLE SO WE LEAN HEAVILY. ON GRANTING OPPORTUNITIES IN AND WE'VE BEEN TURNED OUT A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY SINCE THE FIRES HE SAID AS A HEAD SCRATCHER A SECOND ALL RIGHT WHAT A WILL HOW DID WE DO MISS OUT. ONE BUT WE KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND WE'LL GET THERE SO ANY SUPPORT WE GET FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP JUMP START THESE PROGRAMS OF WE CAN GET OUR FEET UNDER S.. AND GET THE PROGRAM MOVING IS VERY VERY HELPFUL TO ALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY THE THE BIG THING IS IT'S IT'S FUNDING. MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. RIGHT SO ONE QUESTION AND CONCERN THAT I DID HAVE I THINK IT'S IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR NOW THROUGH. THE FIRST TWO PANELS THAT WE REALIZE THAT MITIGATION IN TERMS OF FORRESTER CLEARING BRUSH CLEARANCE HOME ABATEMENT HOME HARDENING IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM PROJECT. BUT ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS -- FOR MY CONSTITUENTS AND MY CONSTITUENTS AND THE MEN AND WOMEN IN FIRE SERVICES IN PARTICULAR IS WHAT CAN WE DO. TO KEEP YOU SAFE IN THE NEXT FEW CYCLES AND YOU EACH MENTIONED -- SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU THINK COULD BE MADE TO THE MUTUAL AID PROGRAM SOUNDS LIKE PRE POSITIONING SHOWS SOME PROMISE BUT THERE WERE OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS -- THAT YOU BOTH MENTIONED I'D I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU I HAVE A MOMENT TO EXPLORE THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH AND SEE IF THAT SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE. TO START TAKING A LOOK AT INVESTING IN -- SO YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S GREAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS OUT TO KEEP US SAFE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE STRUGGLED WITH -- WITH OUR FIRES WAS A LACK OF RESOURCES. AND PART OF THAT -- WAS. CAL FIRE WAS THE COMMAND CENTER FOR THREE MAJOR FIRES THE NOT AS THE TUBS ALICE ONE DISPATCH CENTER. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME AND THEN WHEN YOU SO FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS SEVENTY EIGHT STRIKE TEAMS ORDERED FOR THE TUBS FIRE -- FORTY RIGHT OUT THE GATE AND THEN ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ANOTHER TEN AND A NUMBER AND ANOTHER THREE WE REALLY DIDN'T GET ANY RESOURCES AND FOR PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HOURS. AND RESOURCES THAT DID COME IN KNEW THERE WAS A FIRE BECAUSE OUR BUDDY CALL THEM AND THEY GOT ON THE ROAD AND AND WITHOUT ANY ORDERS WHICH WE TRY NOT TO DO. BUT IN THIS CASE ALL THE ORDERS WENT THROUGH CAL FIRE WHICH GOES THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WHICH WE ASK COMES INTO THAT SYSTEM DOWN THE ROAD. AND FOR FOR ME I'VE BEEN HARPING ON THIS FOR AWHILE -- WHEN WHENEVER WE HAVE BIG ORDERS LIKE THAT WE NEED TO ME WE NEED TO SPLIT HALF GO TO CAL FIRE HALF GO -- TO YES AND YOU GET ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ENGINES GONE AS AS QUICK AS YOU CAN WE HAD A LOT OF ENGINES IN THE EAST BAY. THAT JUST DID NOT GET DISPATCHED BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE TO INPUT ALL THAT INFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO HELP WE CANNOT HOLD UP RESPONSE ON PAPERWORK OR COMPUTER WORK. AND WE NEED TO OVERCOME THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME GOOD WORK THAT THAT THAT CHIEF PORTER. AND DIRECTOR GIL DO SHE'S GOING TO REPORT ON BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CHANGES COMMON. BUT IT'S A BIG SHIP AND BUT WE NEED TO TURN FOR ME IT IS NOT TURNING FAST ENOUGH. AS MUCH AS THEY'RE WORKING ON IT IT'S IT'S IT'S STILL A VERY CUMBERSOME. MODEL SO THAT KEEPS US SAFER KEEPS OUR MEMBER SAFE IT GETS ALL EQUIPMENT THAT WE CAN -- AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE I WILL SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR TO BLAME ANYTHING ON THAT AND I THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES. FOR ANYONE AND I REALIZE THAT THERE'S POOR COMMUNITIES IN MENDOCINO THEY DIDN'T GET ANY RESOURCES NAY LOST PEOPLE AS WELL AS HOMES. SO IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IT WAS VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT. BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE INTO THE RESOURCE ORDERING SYSTEM. AND I'M I'M SURE YOU HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THAT LATER. IT JUST TO KIND OF TACK ON TO THAT TO THAT LOCALLY HERE FOR THE SECOND OWNER FIREFIGHTERS AGAIN TYPICALLY AND ANYONE OF THESE LARGE INCIDENTS. WE ARE USUALLY. ON A NORMAL BASIS WE SET UP THREE STRAIGHT GAMES WHICH IS TYPICALLY THAT'S FIVE ENGINE COMPANIES -- AND MIGHT BE TYPE THREE MIGHT BE TYPE ONE IS PART OF THE YES RESPONSE. WILL CURRENTLY LIKE I SAID EARLIER WHEN. WE ARE RUNNING IT MANDATORY STAFFING ALREADY AND ON A REGULAR BASIS WE'RE HAVING A BROWN OUT OR CLOSE A STATION WHEN WE HAVE ONE OF THESE LARGER SCALE INCIDENTS. I MEAN WE WE RESPOND BUT IT PUTS OUR DEPARTMENTS AT RISK AS WELL AS THE MUSIC MUNICIPALITIES WE SERVE. FROM HAVING TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO CLOSE COMMUNITY RESOURCES HERE IN THE CITY AND THE AREAS OF SACRAMENTO. AND JUST LIKE THE CHIEF WAS SAYING WHEN THEIR FIRE BROKE OUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER FIRE THAT WAS UP IN THE AREA THAT I ACTUALLY LIVE IN UP THE CASCADE FIRE. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED BY THE TUBS FIRE BUT AGAIN LIVES WERE LOST NUMEROUS HOMES WERE LOST UP IN THE LIMERICK AREA AS WELL. AND AGAIN RESOURCES ARE DRAWN DOWN BUT WE PUT OUR DEPARTMENTS AT RISK FROM HAVING TO DELAY RESOURCE ORDERING IN FILLING SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAL U. S.. BASED ON OUR CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS WHICH ARE TOO LOW SO AGAIN EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR STAFFING TO SO MANY SUPPORT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN. GET HELP EVEN IN THAT VENUE WOULD BE GREAT FOR US. THANK YOU ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE IN STOPPING DO YOU THINK WOULD MAKE YOUR DEPARTMENT RECENTLY ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE SEASONS LIKE WE'VE SEEN. CURRENTLY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WERE FOUR TO SIX STATIONS BELOW OUR WHAT OUR CURRENT STAFFING IS SHOULD BEEN REPORTED WHICH IS BEEN STUDIED MULTIPLE TIMES BUT WE STILL HAVE AN ADDED THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED. JUST RECENTLY WE'VE TRIED TO RE OPEN ONE OF OUR STATIONS IT WAS CLOSED YEARS AGO AND AGAIN WE'RE STRUGGLING SO ON A JUST A NORMAL BASIS TO GET US TO WHERE WE SHOULD BE I WOULD ALMOST SAY WE NEED ANOTHER TWENTY TO THIRTY FIREFIGHTERS. A DAY IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO NOW YOU MULTIPLY THAT OUT REGIONALLY AND EVEN GETS LARGER SO PROBABLY IN THE REGION I WOULD SAY ANYWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIREFIGHTERS REGIONALLY. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. YEAH I KNOW YOU MENTIONED BOTH OF YOU I THINK IN A THREAD OF THIS CONVERSATION. THE UTILITIES -- SOME OF THEM HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB I'M THINKING SAN DIEGO OF CREATING STATE OF THE ART. THEY'VE GOT WEATHER STATIONS TO ADDRESS THE MICRO CLIMATES THAT EXIST THERE THERE ARE PRE POSITION DAYS IN ADVANCE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THEY'VE GOT. I SUSPECT P. JEANNIE HASN'T ANYTHING NEAR THAT -- IN EDISON IS KIND OF IN BETWEEN LET'S ASSUME THAT THE THAT ARE UTILITY COMPANIES ACTUALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE? THEM HAPPEN WHAT INTERACTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE TAKE PLACE THAT WILL HELP YOU GIVEN. IF THEY DO START. OF CREATING THE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY. RESOURCES IF THEY USE THEM NOW WE CAN SEE THINGS A COUPLE DAYS IN ADVANCE KNOWING. THE DIFFERENT -- TEMPERATURES TEMPERATURES VERY HUMIDITY VERY EASY EVEN SMALL MICRO CLIMATES. THE WIND IS HIGHER IN CERTAIN PLACES AND CAN BE TESTED WAS SOME OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THE THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE THAT THE UTILITY COMPANY SHOULD BE USING. WELL LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION INTERACTING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT SO THAT THAT CAN HELP YOU BE BETTER PREPARED. TO ANTICIPATE WHAT'S GOING ON AND TO STOP THESE FIRES BEFORE THEY BLOW OUT OF CONTROL. I'LL START A FEEL GOOD -- SO FOR ME YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE HAD TEN TO TWELVE RED FLAGS AND SONOMA COUNTY. WE USED TO A PRE POSITIONING WITH EVERYONE OF THEM AND WE WERE APPROVED FOR EVERYONE OF THE OF THE HI I'M. SESSION SO WE HAD A STRIKE TEAM ADDITIONAL FOR OUR OP AREA WHICH IS CINEMA COUNTY FIVE ENGINES THAT'S HELPFUL BUT IT'S NOT QUITE ENOUGH. THE COUNTY ALSO LET US UP STAFF THEY PUT SOME FUNDING ASIDE FOR THAT. AS WELL SO WE HAD A TASK FORCE RESTRICTING WE HAD TEN ADDITIONAL ENGINES -- THAT WE USED TO HELP DURING THESE THESE RED FLAG WARNINGS. NOW THERE ARE MANY RED FLAGS AND THESE. THE THOUGH THE ONES THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT ARE THE ONES THAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN YOU HAVE FORTY FIFTY SIXTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS. WERE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK WITH SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND IT'S LIKE. HOW DO YOU WE NEED A LOW NOT A RED FLAG WE NEED THE PURPLE FLAG FOR THE BLACK FLAG? THE 1% WEATHER SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN REALLY SATURATED AREA AND IT CAN'T JUST BE AN **** OF SANTA ROSA. IT'S GOT TO BE AND NAPA COUNTIES GOT TO BE IN LAKE COUNTY IT'S GOT TO BE EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. SO WHEN A FIRE DOES HEART THE START THEY GET THERE AS QUICK AS A CANDIDATE. THE THE CONTROLLER OR WE GOT MORE RESOURCES COMMON RIGHT SO. AND AND THAT I WILL TELL YOU I WAS ON HIGHWAY TWENTY ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. AND THE WIND UP WAS INCREDIBLY STRONG BLOWING FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH. THAT I'VE NOW I'VE BEEN ON THAT ROAD QUITE A BIT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THAT AND WHEN I GOT TO HIDDEN VALLEY I STOPPED TO VISIT FAMILY MEMBER AND THERE'S REALLY NO WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE GUSTY BUT REALLY NO WIND. HOUSE ON TUBS LANE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT IT WAS A NORMAL NIGHT. BUT THAT ALL CHANGED AND THAT CHANGE FROM THE WINDS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY SO HE WAS SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY YOU NEED MORE WEATHER STATIONS AND SANTA ROSA YET I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO ALERT US TO WHAT'S COMING SO WE NEED SOMETHING IN IN THE VALLEY. THAT'S GONNA COME OVER THAT SAME LEAN AT THE MOUNTAIN WAVE. THERE'S SOME WEATHER STATIONS ON CHANNEL IN AT LEAST TWO THAT I'M MORE OF BUT THE IT'S IT'S FOR CASTING THOSE BIG WHETHER ADVANCE IN IN P. JEANNIE -- AS PUT UP A LOT OF WEATHER STATIONS AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING A LOT OF WORK. I DON'T KNOW HOW INTEGRATED IT IS EVERYONE'S DOING A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S KIND OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER BUT IT'S NOT COMING TOGETHER. SO WHEN THAT INFORMATION COMES TO ME IN A PERFECT WORLD GOES -- TO YES THIS IS LOOK AT WE GOT THIS ISSUE NOTIFY THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND THEN IT GOES RIGHT DOWN THE LINE TO TO NOTIFY THE REST WAS THAT'S WHERE THIS FUSION CENTER COMES AND HIGH LEVEL -- CAN FOR ME AYE AYE. IF THERE IS A START WE NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION IT IS MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AT THIS SPEED. GET THAT TO THE GROUND LEVEL SO PEOPLE CAN PREPARE THEIR COMMUNITIES TO GET OUT. AS FOR USING CAMERAS FOR IF WE SEE FAR LESS MOVING FAST WE'RE DOING. IS ACTIVATIONS WE'RE NOT WAITING. AND IN SOME CASES WE GOT CRITICIZED FOR NOT EVACUATING QUICK ENOUGH IN OTHER CASES WE ARE CRITICIZED BECAUSE IT WAS TOO BIG OF AN AREA. AND ALSO YOU SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T WIN BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE MY COMMUNITY EVERY CHANCE I GET. TO GET OUT OF THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA STOP THAT YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY. AND THEN. PUT THE FIRE OUT AS IT COMES THROUGH IN FOR US WE CAN CONTROL TO WIN SHIFTED THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING SO MY QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING. TO TAKE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT NEED TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE UTILITY COMPANIES WHOSE HOLES AND WHAT HAVE YOU HAVE BECAUSE OF THE WINDS OR WHATEVER IT IS. HAVE TO HAVE IT INSTIGATED THESE FIRES AND WHAT HAVEYOU. IS THERE SOME RELATIONSHIP THAT ALREADY EXISTS OR THAT -- IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD EXIST SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION THEY GIVE YOU A HEADS UP THAT THERE IS A AN EVENT THAT 1% YOU TALK ABOUT FOR PERHAPS -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF POLICY REQUIRING THAT THERE BE THAT INNER CONNECTIVITY THAT COLLABORATION WITH LOCALS WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET THIS INFORMATION SO THAT YOU THEN GET THE INFORMATION IN CAMBRIDGE BE PREPARED. YES ABSOLUTELY SO SAN DIEGO DOES A GREAT JOB THE COMMUNICATE VERY WELL THEY EVEN MODEL FIRE SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU SOME KIND SOME MODELING -- WE'RE NOT THERE YET WITH P. JEANNIE HAVE A FEELING THERE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND MAYBE DIRECTOR GALA DO SHE HAS A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. HE BE IN THE KNOW WAY MORE THAN ME -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT'S A KIND INFORMATION WE NEED AND WE NEED OPEN COMMUNICATION I CAN'T BE RIGHT NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT. WE GOT IT WILL LET YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN ISSUE. NOW THAT DOESN'T HELP ME I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND WEATHER'S DYNAMICS OF THE CHANGES SO -- IT'S WHEN YOU DO FIND OUT. WE NEED TO HAVE AT THE EARLIEST NOTIFICATION POSSIBLE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THE GERMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN YOUR TESTIMONY AND I THINK I CAN SAY N BEHALF OF THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE -- HUGE THANKS TO YOU AND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE WITH YOU AND AS WE HEAD INTO WARM SEASON YOU KNOW GODSPEED TO ALL OF YOU WE WE ARE HERE WE ARE LISTENING ON WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT YOU.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON THIS -- IMPORTANT -- TOPIC -- A LOT OF FOR A WHAT WE WILL COVER I THINKWILL -- DOVETAIL NICELY WITH THE THE PREVIOUS PANELS -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END. AGAIN I'M TOM PORTER -- CAL FIRE DIRECTOR. AND WHAT. WE NEED TO KIND OF LOOK AT IS IS A WILDFIRE IS A NATURAL PART OF OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPE -- IT'S BEEN HERE LONG BEFORE WE WERE HERE -- AND IT WILL BE HERE LONG AFTER WE ARE GONE -- AND WHAT. IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- OVER TIME IS THERE'S THEY'RE GONNA BE CYCLES CYCLES OF WILDFIRE THAT THAT -- FOLLOW THE VEGETATION PATTERNS OF THE WEATHER PATTERNS THE CHANGING CLIMATE ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS A DEFINITE INCREASE -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF COURSE WAS THE WORST AT THE TIME. A WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND THEN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT. NUMBER WAS DWARFED AGAIN SO WE WENT FROM TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DISTANCE STRUCTURES ALONE TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE DESTROYED -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF WELL OVER. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. SIX OF THOSE WERE FIRST RESPONDERS -- ONE IS TOO MANY. HUNDRED IS HORRIBLE [inaudible] SO. THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES OVERGROWN FORESTS AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR FOR SCIENTISTS PRO LONG DROUGHTS -- WHICH INCREASE OR INCREASE FIRE SPREAD BECAUSE OF DECREASED -- HUMIDITY OR THE SOY SORRY FUELS -- HUMIDITY OR THE MOISTURE IN FUELS -- IT HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER SIZE AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES -- TO AN ALL TIME HIGH AND SO -- WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON MOVING FORWARD -- AND RELATED TO KIND OF BRINGING IT INTO THERE'S THE CONTEXT NOW BRING IT BACK TO WORK -- ARE WE PREPARED -- WE ARE PREPARING AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO HONE OUR PREPARE PREPAREDNESS -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE DOING THAT IS BY -- IDENTIFYING THE THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- LATER IN THE PRESENTATION BUT IDENTIFYING FOR FURTHER ARE -- VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES -- AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS -- PANEL AND DIVISION DEFINING WHERE THOSE ARE RELATED TO THE WE WE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE -- THE INTERMIX AREAS -- AND THEN ALSO THOSE MAPS COVER ALL GROUNDS IN ALL LAND IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT INTO THE CITIES SAN DIEGO LA -- SANTA BARBARA OAKLAND READING [inaudible] PARADISE. VARIOUS SIZE OF CITIES ALL OF THEM HAVE. WILD LANDS THAT IN CROCE INTO THEM. NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE STATE RESPONSIBILITY MANY OF THOSE ARE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- REQUIRING LOCAL LAND USE -- RELATED ISSUES WHICH I ALSO WILL COVER A LITTLE BIT LATER. SO -- ANIMUS SPEAK TO WHAT CAL FIRES DOING PRIMARILY AND I'LL BRING THAT KIND OF TO A BIGGER PICTURE AS WELL. BUT CAL FIRE -- BEING THE STATE'S WILDFIRE -- ORGANIZATION -- WE THE AT THE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OF CAL FIRE. ARE -- POISED TO RESPOND -- WE ARE NOW -- YEAR ROUND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS FIFTY TWO FIRE ENGINES -- COVERED YEAR ROUND -- AND MORE RESOURCES THAN THAT WHEN WE GET INTO OUR LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS -- IN -- IN SOME OF THE AREAS OF THE STATE -- BUT WE ARE ALSO READY -- TO RESPOND TO ALL RISK -- AND WE'RE DOING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. FURTHER WE ARE DOING THOSE LAND USE PLANNING -- RELATED CONSULTING -- THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WE HAVE LAND A LAND USE PLANNING. BUREAU THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE PLANNING -- REQUIREMENTS -- IN THEIR IN THEIR JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. AND WE ARE -- SPREADING THAT WORD AND THEY HAVE AND HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO TO HARDEN THEIR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF WILDFIRES. SO. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY IS GIVE YOU A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF -- FOR THINGS. OUR PEOPLE [inaudible] OUR EQUIPMENT. OUR LANDSCAPE LEVEL WORK. AND OUR PARTNERSHIPS -- AND TO START THAT OFF -- CHIEF JOE TYLER OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FIRE PROTECTION PROGRAMS IS GOING TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THE EQUIPMENT I'LL COME BACK TO YOU IN THE LATER WITH THE LANDSCAPE AND PARTNERSHIPS. JOB. I THANK YOU CHIEF PORTER. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN JOE TYLER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FIRE PROTECTION FOR CAL FIRE. MY APOLOGIES AND HORSE TODAY BEEN COUGHING IS I APOLOGIZE IN THE BACKGROUND -- AS SHE SAID OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND SUPPORT STAFF AT THE STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL LEVELS OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE. RESPONDING TO A OVER FIFTY SIX HUNDRED FIRES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILDLAND FIRES ACROSS STATE CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP. TO YOUR SIDE CAL FIRES RESPONSIBILITIES -- TAKE ON THE LINKS AND DEPTH AND BREATH. OF OF THE STATE AND IS. A PART OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND RESOURCE PROTECTION FORCE WITH OVER. SIXTY ONE HUNDRED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE WORKING ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND NINE MONTHS PER YEAR -- OVER A HUNDRED A CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS WHO MAKE UP OUR OUR HAND CREWS IN BUTTE PLASTER AND OF INTER COUNTIES IN CAMERINO. OVER SIX HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME IN THE VARIOUS UNITS ACROSS THE STATE. AS WELL AS UP. TO FORTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES IN WARD TO SUPPLEMENT OUR IN MAY HAND CREWS AT OUR THIRTY NINE CONSERVATION CAMPS AND THREE A CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR AS THE CHIEF MENTIONED -- FIFTY TWO ENGINES AT MINIMUM HAVE BEEN STAFF BY CAL FIRE YEAR ROUND TO AUGMENT THE STATE MASTER MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. AS WELL AS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OF CALIFORNIA IN THE AREAS THAT THEY'RE LOCATED. HERE RECENTLY WE HAVE -- AUGMENTED THE STAFFING -- HERE JUST APRIL FIFTEENTH -- TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND FIREFIGHTERS. TO BEGIN THE AUGMENTATION PROCESS TO RAMP UP IN THE FIRE SEASON. THIS WILL ALLOW OF THOSE RESPOND HERS TO WORK ON THINGS SUCH AS A FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS PRESCRIBED FIRE AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN WHICH THERE'S SO OFTEN RESPOND TO YOU -- AS WE MOVE FOR THE GOAL IS TO HAVE ALL THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE OF OUR STATE FIRE ENGINES. STAFF BY EARLY JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND LESS AS FAR CONDITIONS A WARRANT STAFFING EARLIER IN WHICH WE WILL EITHER STAFF UP. OR MOVE RESOURCES TO THE MOST FIRE PRONE AREAS. IN ADDITION -- TO OUR LOCAL AND FEDERAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS CAL FIRE BRINGS FORWARD SIX OF OUR EXPERIENCE FIFTY FIVE MEMBER -- INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO RESPOND TO LARGE AND MAJOR DISASTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN DEPLOYED? MOVING INTO THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. A NO REGRETS OF THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL YEAR ROUND FIRE ENGINES AND A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POSITIONS. TO STAFF TO AUGMENT THE EXISTING FLEET WITH YEAR ROUND ENGINES BRINGING THE TOTAL ENGINES AVAILABLE FOR CAL FIRE TO AUGMENT THE STATE MASTER MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX ENGINES -- TO TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT WHILE AND THREAT THAT WE HAVE -- INTO YOU ADD RESOURCES EARLIER AND LATER INTO THE SEASON. TO BRING MORE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL PROBLEM. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE REQUESTING THIRTY FOUR POSITIONS -- FOR AUGMENTATION OF OUR BULLDOZERS ARE FIFTY EIGHT BULLDOZERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. TWO OPERATORS ON THEM -- AS WE SEEN LAST YEAR UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD THE DEATH OF A DON SMITH A PRIVATE DOES OUR OPERATOR IN THE CAR FIRE IN SHASTA COUNTY. AS WELL AS BRADEN VARNEY -- A CALIFORNIA'S OUR OPERATOR IN MARIPOSA COUNTY WHO LOST HIS LIFE OUR HOPE WITH THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AS THE ODD MAN PROVIDE SUPERVISION ON THE GROUND. OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE DOZERS IN THIS ROUGH RUGGED COUNTRY. THAT WE PLACE THEM IN. ADDITIONALLY WE ALL DESIRE MORE INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE AND WHILE WE RE DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL -- ANNUALLY AND AND THROUGH THE FIRE SEASON -- TO PROVIDE THAT INTEL AND INFORMATION WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'LL AUGMENT OUR INTEL. A STAFF ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATION CENTERS IN READING AND RIVERSIDE AS WELL AS SACRAMENTO. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE TIMELY INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE TO THE DECISION MAKERS ON THE GROUND. AS WELL AS AS WELL AS OUR GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS. AS YOU MOVE INTO A QUICK MAN I TALKED ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE FIRE ENGINES IN THE STAFFING THAT THE NORTHERN IN THE SOUTHERN REGIONS ARE DOING. AS OF THIS WEEK TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE OF OUR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE FIRE ENGINES ARE STAFFED -- AGAIN TO SUPPORT THAT FUELS REDUCTION PRESCRIBED FIRE NUMBER TWO SPOTS. IN ADDITION TO THE FIRE ENGINES THOUGH WE WE BRING WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARTNERS -- OTHER SPECIALIZE RESOURCES AS WELL INCLUDING -- BULLDOZERS FIFTY EIGHT OF THOSE AS I DESCRIBED IN UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIVE HAND CREWS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CHIEF AND MAJOR GENERAL BALD WHEN I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT LATER -- THE FUELS REDUCTION CREWS THAT ARE OUT THERE CURRENTLY -- TRYING TO REDUCE THOSE FUELS HAZARDS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. MOST PRONE AND MOST RISKS TO A DEVASTATING FIRE. WE HAVE AIR TANKERS THAT -- THAT WE USED IN OUR CAL FIRE -- FIREFIGHTING OPERATION CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWENTY TWO AIR TANKERS. OF THAT RESPOND THE FIRES BUT LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS THEY RESPOND ON AN INITIAL ATTACK OR IMMEDIATELY UPON DISPATCH AN AUGMENTATION OF AIRCRAFT WILL GENERALLY BE. A DISPATCH TO THE AREA. THOSE ARE LOCATED -- CURRENTLY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VARIOUS ERROR AND HELLO ATTACK BASES CURRENTLY CAL FIRE HAS AIR TANKERS STAFFED AND SITTING AVAILABLE. IN SONORA HOLLISTER PASO ROBLES SUPPORTER VILLE RIVERSIDE RAMONA. AND AT MCCLELLAN -- BASE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR REMAINING AIRBASES IN THE NORTH WILL BE STAFF NO LATER THAN -- JUNE FIRST OF THIS YEAR. IN TOTAL CAL FIRE WILL HAVE TWENTY TWO AVAILABLE AIR TANKERS TO AUGMENT THE FLEET AND ASSESS THE WITH AN ADDITIONAL -- TEN HELICOPTERS -- THAT BELONG TO CAL FIRE -- TO AUGMENT THE LOCAL AND FEDERAL RESPONSE AS WELL. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING BOTH ARE -- FOR FIXED AND ROTARY WING AIRCRAFT FLEET -- CAL FIRE IS WORKING -- THROUGH THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. FOR THE TRANSITION OF SEVERAL SEVEN FEDERAL C. -- ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO AUGMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FLEET WITH THE S. TO FLEET THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IS BEING RUN HEAV -- EACH YEAR OF THOSE AIRFRAMES THAT WERE USING CURRENTLY ARE THE ONLY REMAINING AIR FRAMES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE IN SERVICE. SO LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE OF THE C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKER PROGRAM IT IS THE NEXT BEST GENERATION. AIR TANKER -- THAT WILL DELIVER RETARDANT TO THE GROUND -- THAT WE CAN LOOK AT INTO THE FUTURE. WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AIRFORCE IT'S OUR INTENT -- TO HAVE THE AIRFORCE OR HOPE THAT THE AIRFORCE WILL AWARD A BID FOR THE RETARDANT DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WILL GO INTO THE SEVEN AIR TANKERS. IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THEN THROUGH WARNER ROBINS AIR FORCE LOGISTICS BASE IN GEORGIA -- THEY WILL HAVE TO BE INSTALLED WE DON'T EXPECT TO SEE THE FIRST -- ACTUAL OPERATIONAL AIR TANKER IN CALIFORNIA AT THE C. ONE THIRTY LEVEL -- BELONGING CAL FIRE AND OF FISCAL YEAR. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONCE THESE AIR TANKERS ARRIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL START ARRIVING SHORTLY THERE AFTER THEY WILL BE PLACED IN MCCLELLAN RAMONA. FRESNO PASS REBELS AND CHICO. I TALKED ABOUT THE S. TO AIR TANKER FLEET -- BEING RUN HARD OUR INTENT THERE IS THE PULL TO THE S. TO TEAR FRAMES OUT OF SERVICE -- IN BEGIN REBUILDING THEM SO IT'LL EXTEND THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THE S. TWO T. FLEET BY THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS. CALPERS ALSO REPLACING THROUGH -- A PROPOSAL LAST FISCAL YEAR -- THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON OF A REPLACING OUR VIETNAM ERA SUPER HUEY HELICOPTERS THAT HAVE BEEN THE WORK COURSE OF OUR FLEET. BUT LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE THE S. SEVENTY AYE BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER WHICH IS THE CIVILIAN VERSION OF THE SIKORSKY U. H.. SIXTY IS GOING TO BE OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE CURRENTLY THE FIRST AIRCRAFT IS SITTING IN INGLEWOOD COLORADO GETTING ITS AVIONICS AND ACCESSORIES PUT INTO IT -- WORLD BE DELIVERED TO MCCLELLAN PARK AND OUR AVIATION MANAGEMENT UNIT IN JUNE OR EARLY JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FROM THERE WE ALREADY TRAINING OUR PILOTS AND PERSONNEL ON THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE THAT PROCESS OFTRAINING OUR FOLKS. IN THAT ARENA. THE SECOND HELICOPTER -- WAS JUST FLOWN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA -- TO DECATUR TEXAS WHERE IT'S GETTING ITS PAINT AND THEN WILL BE FLOWN TO INGLEWOOD COLORADO FOR ITS AVIONICS AND ACCESSORIES. AND THEN FLOWN TO A CLONE PARK AS WELL WE WILL SEE THAT HELICOPTER IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEREAFTER WERE HOPING TO SEE. THE REMAINING HELICOPTERS THAT -- WILL BE COMING IN -- EVERY FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS THERE AFTER. ONCE WE HAVE -- THE HELICOPTERS IN PLACE AND WE'VE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED OUR PILOTS AND OUR HELLO TECH CREWS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH AT LEAST FIVE OF THE HELICOPTERS FLYING A NIGHT VISION GOGGLES AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR OPERATIONS. THE CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTING PLANES HELICOPTERS FIRE ENGINES BULLDOZERS AND OTHER RESOURCES -- DESIGN IS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED TO MEET THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION OF CONTAINING FIRES AND 95%. OF ALL FIRES A TEN ACRES ALAS THERE'S NO SINGLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WILL DO IT BY ITSELF THERE'S NO SINGLE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THE CAN DO IT BY ITSELF. IT IS A STATE MASTER MUTUAL AID SYSTEM BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT MAKE THE FIRE SYSTEM OR THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA WORK. CALPERS ALSO LOOKING AT LEVERAGING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT PREDICT AND MODEL FIRES. OF FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR DECISION MAKERS ARE RESPOND IS ON THE GROUND AND THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE PUBLIC INFORMATION OUT SOONER. GOVERNOR SOME ON JANUARY EIGHTH -- PROVIDED EXECUTIVE ORDER FOUR DASH NINETEEN WHICH WAS THE INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENT SPRINT -- THROUGH A CAL FIRE -- BEING THE FIRST -- DEPARTMENT WHO WAS -- DESIGNATED TO ENTER INTO THE INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENT SPRINT WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES -- TO PURCHASE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AT A AT A EXPEDIENT A PROCESS. TO GET CUTTING EDGE INFORMATION TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND PROPERTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE PROCUREMENT A SPRINT IS DESIGN AND ITS PROBLEM STATEMENT TO REDUCE -- MITIGATE OR REDUCE RISKS TO HUMAN LIFE REAL PERSONAL PROPERTY -- INFRASTRUCTURE AND DAMAGE TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES CALIFORNIA. OUR HOPE IS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- THAT WE WILL FIND AND LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ASSIST IN DECREASING THOSE RISKS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INNOVATORS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT IDEAS IN WELL OVER A HUNDRED IDEAS CAME FORWARD. THOSE IDEAS WERE DUE BY APRIL TWENTY FIFTH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BETWEEN THE THREE AGENCIES THEY'RE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THOSE PROCESSES NOW -- WITH AN INTENSE TO LOOK AT PROOF OF CONCEPT WITH SOME OF THE INNOVATORS BETWEEN JULY AND NOVEMBER -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NGUYEN PROOF OF CONCEPT IS COMPLETE IN MORE EVALUATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THEN THE HOPE IS WITH THE SUPPORT OF OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL BE ABLE. TO AWARD -- SOME GREAT TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS TO GO INTO THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIRE SEASON. FINALLY AS A CHEAP GOZEN OR TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET -- PROVIDES IN REQUESTS A HUNDRED FIRE VALIDATION CAMERAS NOW MANY TIMES THEY'RE CONSIDERED FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS BUT WE PLACE THE STRATEGICALLY AND DECISION MAKING POINTS SUCH AS OUR EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS. TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR -- THE DIRECTION THAT THESE CAMERAS GO. THE AUGMENTATION OF THIS REQUEST WITH A HUNDRED CAMERAS ACROSS THE STATE IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH OUR UTILITIES AND OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERS WHO ARE INSTALLING CAMERAS ACROSS THE STATE. WILL ALLOW GREATER BENEFIT FOR US TO MONITOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE TOPOGRAPHY LOOKING FOR SMOKES -- AND EVALUATING FIRE CONDITIONS WITH THAT'LL TURN BACK TO CHIEF PORTER. THANK YOU CHIU TYLER. THANK YOU GEE TYLER -- SO COMING BACK TO KIND OF STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE AND HIGH LEVEL THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT FIFTY THOUSAND FOOT LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING BEYOND -- THE THINGS THAT THAT CHIEF TYLER MENTIONED AND PREVIOUS HAVE MENTIONED -- IT LANDSCAPE LEVEL. THIS IS REALLY A LANDSCAPE LEVEL ISSUE IN MANY IN MANY RESPECTS -- CAL FIRE BEING OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION -- UTILITY WE'RE UTILIZING OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STAFF FORESTERS -- PLANNERS AND OUR OUR MAPPING CAPABILITIES -- AS STATED IN PREVIOUS TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS THAT NEED -- TREATMENT AND AS SENATOR DODD MENTION THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE. GOAL FOR FUELS TREATMENT ACROSS THE STATE. OUR ON STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS. ADDITIONALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO DO A TO MATCH THAT WITH ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE WILD LAND OR THE FOR THE FOR SERVICE -- AND FEDERAL LANDS SO -- IN OUR ENDEAVOR TO MEET THAT -- THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WE ARE INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING HAPPEN -- WE ARE INCREASING OUR PACE AND SCALE OF FUELS TREATMENT THROUGH THE FUELS -- CREWS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY BY CHIEF TYLER -- WE ARE -- STRATEGICALLY PLACING THOSE FUELS PROJECTS -- WHERE THEY NEED TO BE -- STE. THIS YEAR -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDER -- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT CAME OUT. IN JANUARY ON JANUARY EIGHTH -- THAT. DIRECTED US TO FIND THOSE PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL THOSE PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE DONE THIS YEAR TO PROTECT. LIVES AND PROPERTY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS REALLY IS WHAT IT CAME OUT TO BE -- AND SO WE IDENTIFIED THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS UNDER THAT PROCESS -- AND THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS -- OF THEM THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THEIR FINAL APPROVAL PROCESS TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM -- ARE EITHER IN A CONTRACTING PHASE OR THEY HAVE -- WORK BEING DONE ON THE GROUND -- THE OTHER THE OTHERS ARE IN -- THEIR FINAL REVIEW PROCESS BEFORE THEY CAN GET TO THE CONTRACTING -- PIECE. SO -- AND THE NEW THING ABOUT THAT IS THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY PEACE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT IN THOSE HI FIRE RISK AREAS PEOPLE THAT. I HAVE MOBILITY ISSUES IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS -- SO WHAT WHAT -- ALSO WAS MENTIONED IS THE THE CAL V. T. P. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAMMATIC III ARE. THAT WE HAVE TO GET CERTIFIED THIS YEAR. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IS IS WORKING HARD ON THAT WE HAVE -- GREAT CONSULTANTS THAT ARE WORKING TO GET THAT DONE THAT THIS THESE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS ARE THE BRIDGE TO THAT DOCUMENT. THAT DOCUMENT WILL GIVE US A SEEK WORK COMPLIANT PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH -- THE FUELS TREATMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS STATE TO MEET THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE GOAL ANNUALLY. HI I'M GONNA LEAVE THE FUELS CREWS TO MY COLLEAGUE. FROM THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. AND SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE -- ANY FURTHER BUT WE HAVE MET THUS FAR THIS YEAR CAL FIRE STRAIN. TO DO SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S WHAT CAL FIRE IS DOING -- AND WORKING TOWARD ANNUALLY THIS YEAR ARE OUR GOAL WAS. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND RIGHT NOW AS OF TODAY WE ARE OVER -- TWENTY THOUSAND SO WE'RE OF WERE WELL OVER HALF WAY THROUGH THOSE ACRES AND THIS IS THE BURNING SEASON O WE'RE ADDING ACRES EVERY DAY AS WE GO -- TO ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PANELS -- REQUEST FOR GRANT FUNDING -- WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT MAJOR GRANT FUNDING PROCESSES THAT WE DO -- ONE IS FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FORCED RESILIENCE THAT IS REALLY LOOKING AT THESE LARGE LANDSCAPE LEVEL -- PROJECTS TO GET US THE BOOK OF THE ACRES TOWARD THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GOAL. THE OTHER IS THE FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF GRANTS THOSE OUR COMMUNITY CHIPPING PROJECTS THOSE ARE OUR COMMUNITY DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- FUEL BREAKS IN AND AROUND -- THE THE THE COMMUNITIES -- WE HAVE FOR GRANTED -- JUST UNDER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TOWARD THAT IN THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. AND WE WILL CONTINUE -- TO INCREASE THAT -- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH OUR OUR GRANT PROGRAMMING THAT'S THAT'S COMING -- IN SUCCESSIVE BUDGETS -- FOR THAT PURPOSE. SO -- WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL THAT'S THAT ST THINNING REFORESTATION OF FORCED AN INSECT DISEASE TREATMENTS PRESCRIBED FIRE AS MENTIONED -- COMMUNITY CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT -- IN THIS IS TO GET WE NEED OUTLETS FOR THESE MATERIALS WE NEED -- WORKERS THAT DO THIS KIND OF WORK THAT ARE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DOTHAT INTO THE FUTURE AND STE. DEVELOP A SELF SUSTAINING MODEL WE CAN'T FUNDED THIS FOREVER. IT NEEDS TO FIND A WAY TO BE AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. JOB AND THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE AND MAKE IT MAKE IT HAPPEN SO PARTNERSHIPS. OUR PUBLIC. AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE OF ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS IS INCREDIBLE AND I WON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID -- BUT WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THAT THE PUBLIC. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. IS THE KEY TO THIS PROBLEM. WE NEED TO GET TO EVERY SINGLE ONE AND EXPLAIN AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILD FIRE DOES MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM. NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ALSO -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT 95% OF ALL WILDLAND FIRES ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS. THAT MEANS THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY PREVENTABLE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FIRES ARE ACCIDENTALLY STARTED -- OR STARTED WITHOUT IT ANYBODY EVEN KNOWING THAT IT HAPPENED. THOSE CAN BE PREVENTED. EDUCATION TO THOSE ENDS -- NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED AT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THE ONES IN THE WILD LANDS -- EVERYONE -- AND JUST LAST WEEK WE FINISHED WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS WEEK WE STE WE WENT. TOP TO BOTTOM OF THE STATE -- AND SPREAD THE MESSAGE -- IN EVERY LARGE -- MEDIA MARKET -- WE DID THAT WITH OUR LOCAL AND AND FEDERAL PARTNERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- AND EVEN OUR UTILITY PARTNERS WERE PART OF THAT AS WELL. PART OF THE MESSAGE IS THE READY SET GO MESSAGE AND I'M JUST GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT OUR OUR WEBSITE -- THE READY FOR WILDFIRE DOT ORG TO LOOK AT WHAT READY SET GO HE IS AS A PROGRAM ALSO -- TO DOWNLOAD OUR APPS. WHICH IS THE CAL FIRE -- READY FOR WILDFIRE APP ON ANY APPLE OF STORE -- IT'S A FREE APP AND IT GIVES YOU METHODS TO GO THROUGH AND DO DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE ON PREPARING YOUR OWN HOME AND YOUR OWN FAMILY FOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS BE READY. GET SET AND GO WHEN THE TIME IS IS RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT ON DIVERT DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS WE WE HEARD -- SOME OF THE CONCERN ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS AND I A I DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE NEED WE COULD DO BETTER AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. INSPECTIONS -- WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS -- CAL FIRE STATISTICS SHOW THAT. 82% OF HOMES THAT ARE INSPECTED. PASSED ON THEIR FIRST INSPECTION SO THAT MEANS 82% OF THE INSPECTIONS THAT WE'RE DOING ON THE FIRST PASS. AS A COMPLIANT HOUSEHOLD. BY THE THIRD INSPECTION WHICH IS THE THE INSPECTION WHEN ON OF OF VIOLATION IS WRITTEN. 92%. SO OF THOSE THE PERCENTAGE OF OF OF ITS 8% ROUGHLY. OF THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOT COMPLIANT. AND THEN A PORTION OF THOSE THAT ARE GOING -- TO TO A ABATEMENT TYPE OF SITUATION. AND OF COURSE THAT DOES VERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE DO NOT. INSPECT EVERY STRUCTURE. SO SO THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR FOR SOME SOME -- SOME SLOPPING HERE FOR SURE -- THE GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA -- IS TO GET TO IN THE WILDLAND AREAS THE THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY-- WE ARE HALF WAY TO THAT GOAL. AND EXPECT TO BE VERY CLOSE TO MEETING THAT TARGET THIS YEAR IF WE GET TO THAT THAT'S ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS WE'RE INSPECTING EACH HOME. NOT EVERY YEAR. STRUCTURE HARDENING IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. AND AS I SAID THE THE APP WILL HELP. US TO GET THEIR LAND USE PLANNING -- CODE CODE ENFORCEMENT AND AND ENSURING THAT. THAT -- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENCOURAGE RETROFITTING OF HOMES THAT ARE EXISTING NON COMPLIANT. TO EXISTING CODES EXISTING CODES -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN PARTICULAR ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. IN HARDENING HOMES. SO THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM. IT IS EXISTING NON COMPLIANT AND SO WE NEED TO WORK TOWARD THAT STRUCTURE HARDENING -- CHIEF OF GOZER WAS MENTIONING THE HOME THE HOME FIRES AND A FIRE I NEXT DOOR FIRE BURNING -- IGNITING A HALF OF THE HOUSE NEXT TO IT THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. WE NEED TO GET TO A CRITICAL MASS OF HARDENED STRUCTURES IN A IN A COMMUNITY SO WE DON'T HAVE URBAN CONFLAGRATION HAPPENING. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THERE IS BY. REALLY HARDENING THE COMMUNITY NOT JUST AT A STRUCTURE THAT TIME. SO IN CONCLUSION -- I WANT TO I I CAN'T. EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS IS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY. ALL TOOLS ALL HANDS. ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM THE PANELS BEFORE. IT'S GONNA TAKE FIREFIGHTERS FORESTERS LAND. PLANNERS -- ENGINEERS. INSPECTORS ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS -- TO TO MOVE DOWN A MOVE TO WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND THE DIRECTION WE NEEDED TO GO AND ALL OF THIS IS COMING AT A GREAT COST -- IT'S IT WAS HEARTENING TO HEAR ON THE LAST PANEL -- THE FIREFIGHTERS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND COMMUNITIES ARE. REALLY. HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME WITH THIS. MY FIREFIGHTERS WE REALIZED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- NEEDED SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. WE'VE BEEN SEEING LONG DEPLOYMENTS FORTY FIVE SIXTY DAYS. AND DURING THE THOMAS FIRE -- WASN'T THE FIRST TIME BUT IT WAS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST EFFORTS -- WE PUT A TRAILER IN CAMP. AND PUT OUR OUR EMPLOYEES SUPPORT SERVICES THERE IN CAMP. TO WORK WITH THE FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAD BEEN THERE. FOR THIRTY PLUS DAYS AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT THERE THEY WERE LOOKING AT CHRISTMAS. RIGHT THERE IN THE HEADLIGHTS WE WERE ALL GOING TO SPEND CHRISTMAS THAT DOWN THERE. THANKFULLY WE GOT EVERYBODY OUT MOST EVERYBODY [inaudible] BUT THAT THAT -- EMPLOYEES SUPPORT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND IT IS ONE THAT -- A THAT WE ARE WORKING HARD ON AS AS MENTIONED -- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS HAS -- POSITIONS FOR CALIFORNIA -- TO DO THAT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT -- AND YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HOW MANY MORE. DO WE NEED. AND WHAT I'LL I'LL POINT TWO IS WE HAVE A STAFFING MODEL -- IT WITH CAL IN WITHIN CAL FIRE AND I'M JUST GONNA TALK TO MY DEPARTMENT -- THAT IS THAT HAS ROUGHLY TWO POINT SEVEN POSITIONS PER. SEAT WE COVER THOSE SEAT. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND AND WITHOUT GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS OVER TIME WE REALLY NEED IN ORDER TO COVER VACATION AND RELIEF AND AND -- INJURED AND AND SICK -- WE REALLY NEED SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE POINT TWO PEOPLE PERCEIVED. SO WE'RE WE'RE AT A DEFICIT AND DUE TO THAT DEFICIT -- OUR HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES. ARE WORKING MORE DAYS THAN THEM THEY WOULD HAVE TO IF IF WE HAD MORE PEOPLE WILL PEOPLE COST MONEY. AND PEOPLE ARE ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS. TO TO ADD -- AND SO. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THAT AND IT NEEDS TO BE -- SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT WE ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING IN THOSE EXTRA HARD HOURS -- IN THE INTERIM AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM -- IS MEANT TO DO -- THAT WE EXCLUDE ANYBODY FROM IT'S NOT JUST FOR CAL FIRE. WHEN WE'RE IN FIRE CAMPS WERE ALL FIREFIGHTERS -- WITH THAT I'M GOING -- TO PASSED MY THE MY AREA MIKE. TO MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] LOOKS LIKE. THANKS CHIEF GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M -- MAJOR GENERAL DAVE BALDWIN I'M THE ADJUTANT GENERAL I LEAD THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. WE'VE COMPLETED ALL OF OUR STANDARD -- WILDFIRE PREPARATIONS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. WE'VE -- PREPARED ALL FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE WITHIN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT TO BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES AT THE CALL OF EITHER -- YES FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'VE TRAIN TWENTY SIX HELICOPTER CREWS AND CERTIFIED THEM IN JOINT EXERCISES WITH CAL FIRE IN FIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS. AND IN THOSE EXERCISES WE ALSO INTEGRATED OUR INCIDENT AWARENESS TEAMS WHICH INCLUDES THE MQ NINE REAPER UNMANNED AIRCRAFT WHICH WE'VE PROVEN TO BE. CRITICAL FOR FIRE MAPPING AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. THEY SURE WERE CURRENTLY WE HAVE ONE OF OUR TWO AIR TANKERS ARE AVAILABLE WITH THE TRAIN CREW NOW -- THE OTHERS ARE DEPLOYED TO THE COMBAT ZONE TO RETURN IN AUGUST AND WILL TRAIN THEM SO BE READY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FALL -- FIRE SEASON FOR US. THAT'S ALL THE STUFF THAT WE NORMALLY DO IN A REGULAR YEAR BUT THIS YEAR. WE'VE DONE A COUPLE OF INNOVATIVE THINGS -- THE FIRST AS WE'VE MANAGED TO GAIN ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENT DEFENSE RESOURCES FOR INCIDENT AWARENESS AND WORKED REPORTER CALLS TO GET PASS AND CLASSIFICATION ISSUES. THEY ALLOW US TO PUT INTELLIGENCE ANALYST ON DUTY IN ADVANCE OF OF A RED FLAG WARNING OR BAD FAR WHETHER TO BE ABLETO HELP. CAL FIRE NOT ONLY PREDICT BUT DETECT AND TRACK FIRES EARLIER ON IN THEIR START PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S HIGH WIND EVENTS IN AND WHEN THERE'S HEAVY SMOKE CONDITIONS. WERE OTHER -- SENSORS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AVAILABLE -- WE ALSO -- THIS YEAR HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME TRAINED. FIRE FIGHTING HAND CREWS AHEAD OF THE FIRE SEASON AND THE USE OF THE FOR A CURRENTLY THE HAND CREWS THAT WERE USING AND FEEL REDUCTION. BUSINESS -- WHICH WE TRAINED UP A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN OF WHICH WE PUT A HUNDRED AND TEN ON DUTY A HUNDRED OF WHOM WERE SIGNED. TO FIVE TWENTY MAN TYPE TO HAND CREWS THEY'RE CURRENTLY AS WE SPEAK WORKING THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA AT THE DIRECTION OF CAL FIRE -- TO REDUCE THE FUEL LOADS -- THOSE TEAMS ARE BASED IN REDDING AUBURN MONTEREY AND TO IN FRESNO IN THE EVENT OF FIRE STARTS IN THE AREA THAT ARE SIGN. WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE -- TO REVERT FROM DOING FEEL MANAGEMENT INTO BECOMING FIRE SUPPRESSION HAND CREWS AND OF COURSE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT THE DEPTH THAT -- IF CALIFORNIANS ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS WE CAN -- MOBILE ICE AND TRAIN THOSE TANKERS VERY QUICKLY WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. SO WITH THAT I'LL BE FOLLOWED BY -- DIRECTOR GIL TEACHER FROM -- YES EXTRA LONG. AFTER MARKET RDG DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HAPPEN TO BE WITH YOU AND WITH MY GREAT. COLLEAGUES HERE WE ARE TRULY WON T. ONE FIGHTING IN CALIFORNIA AND MANAGING THESE VARIOUS -- CHALLENGES WE HAVE -- YES IS RESPONSIBILITY AS I I KNOW YOU KNOW IS REALLY THE OVER ARCHING COORDINATION OF OF THE STATE'S. ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR PLANNED FOR RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM. ALL HAZARD EMERGENCY SITUATIONS TODAY OBVIOUSLY WERE FOCUSING ON WALL FIRE IN THE PREPAREDNESS LEVEL THAT WE'VE WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING ON TO GET THERE. I THINK AS A CONTEXT -- WHY YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT? A PLENTY ABOUT -- THE THE FIRES OF OF LAST YEAR -- I THINK -- IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT -- SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED HUNDREDS OF OF MAJOR STATE -- DISASTERS -- WHEN I CALL A MAJOR I I MEAN SIGNIFICANT -- VANCE THAT HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF STRUCTURES LOSS OF LIVES OR INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE -- AND OUT OF THAT OF FOURTEEN OF THOSE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN HAPPENED -- DECLARE PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER -- DECORATIONS ARE MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO GET TO A PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION YOU NEED A MINIMUM OF ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE LOSS AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT. WRAP AROUND THAT AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS CLEARLY HAVE -- CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO CHANGE THAT OUR RESULTING IN THE ABILITY OF ALL OF US TO HAVE TO RESPOND THINK ABOUT RESPOND. TO THESE EVENTS IN A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE MUCH MORE FORWARD LEANING FASHION -- IN FACT LEADING UP TO THE CAMPFIRE -- THERE WERE MULTIPLE FIRESTHAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THERE WAS STRETCHING FIRE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EMERGENCY SERVICES RESOURCES -- MULTIPLE FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND OF THE OF OF JUST OF THE FIFTIES FIRES THE KRANZ THEN THE FERGUSON THE CAR THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX DOWNHILL THE WALLS THE AND THE CAMP OF THOSE FIVE RESULTED IN A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS -- AND SO -- THE THERE WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO REALLY BE THINKING THROUGH THIS AND HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS NEW NORM -- AND PREPARING FOR IT IS AN EVOLVING PROCESS THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET -- THERE IS NO ONE WAY -- IS NOT LINEAR IS ASYMMETRIC AND IS REQUIRING US TO COMPLETELY COME TOGETHER -- AS ALL THE ENTITIES NOT JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE CITIZENS -- THEMSELVES -- I WANT TO TALK A LOT ABOUT -- SOME OF THE KEY AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON OVER ARCHING FOR PREPAREDNESS I WANT TO START OFF. IN THE AREA OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE AREA THAT. IS A IN MANY WAYS A WEAK LINK IN THE OVER ARCHING ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HERE THIS MORNING. STARTING WITH GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. BUT IN FACT THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC AND EMERGENCY AND TO COMMUNICATE AMONGST -- RESPOND HERS -- INEFFECTIVE WAY -- SO MUCH OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- OUTSIDE OF LAND MOBILE RADIO CAPABILITY IN THE STATE'S MICROWAVE NETWORK. HAS GONE TO THE USE OF THE CELLULAR NETWORK -- AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS WE USE THAT FOR DATA PUSHING WE USE THAT IN OUR NIGHT WHEN ONE CENTERS WE USE THAT. ACROSS THE BOARD IN -- ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. THAT ENTIRE SYSTEM IS NOT OWNED. NOR CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE THROWING LITERALLY ALL OF OUR EGGS IN THAT BASKET TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE -- AND WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN THAT EVEN AS THE PUBLIC USING USE OF OF CELLPHONES. WE HAVE BECOME DEPENDENT UPON BEING ABLE TO GET GOOD CLEAN CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS AND WE TALK ABOUT ISSUING A LORTON WARNINGS AND PUSHING OUT. CRITICAL DATA TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN. THE ADVANCE OF A FAST MOVING WILDFIRE. THAT SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE RESILIENT AND RE DONE DEBT AND STAND UP THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND THAT FIRE SITUATION SO THAT COMMUNICATIONS CAN STILL TAKE PLACE. FORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT HAPPENING -- THE ABILITY -- TO HAVE A RESILIENT AND HARDENED TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL A WEAK LINK IN THE SYSTEM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS. TO BILL WHAT I CALL PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE COMMUNICATIONS HARDLY THAT IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT IS EMERGENCY POWER BATTERY OR GENERATOR BACK UP. THAT IS A HARDENING OF THE BACK HALL FIBER LINES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR MOVING THE DATA IN EFFECTIVE MANNER -- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING -- TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM BUT WE'RE ALSO MOVING TO SOMETHING CALL FIRST AT WHICH IS A BROADBAND BEING. CAPABILITY WAR INNER -- INTER OPERABILITY IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ALL PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER. ALL OF THAT IS DRIVEN BY A SYSTEM WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR MOVING FORWARD -- AND THE ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THAT. THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL. THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE DOING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AS THE ENTITY IN THE STATE THAT MANAGES PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS IS MOVING -- TO UPGRADE OUR NIGHT WHEN ONE SYSTEM -- AND MOVING TO NEXT GENERATION I WOULD WANT AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE SEVENTIES -- AND HAS REALLY BEEN A PHENOMENAL CAPABILITY -- NOW IS REALLY PAST ITS PRIME AND IS AT IS IS REALLY BEING HELD TOGETHER -- AT YOU KNOW AS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND WE NEED -- TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM IMPROVE IT -- THAT WILL THEN 'LL HAVE A CASCADING IMPACT ON THE THE THE THE DIFFERENT AREAS ALL TALK ABOUT A MINUTE IN SITUATION AWARENESS. AND ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE -- I'LL START OFF WITH THE NEXT GEN NIGHT WHEN ONE WHICH IS REALLY MOVING -- TO AND IP BASED SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING ALL OF THE DATA SOURCES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT TODAY. SHE POURED IMAGINE THE SPREAD -- WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES -- AND IN SOME IN MANY CASES ARE NIGHT WHEN SYSTEMS OR STILL ANALOG DRIVEN AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY THINK THROUGH ANDTHE ABILITY TO OPERATE THAT THIS WILL INCLUDE. A COMMON STATEWIDE ALERT AND WARNING PLATFORM WHICH TIES IN TO BE ALERT AND WARNING GUIDELINES THAT WERE ISSUED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO -- TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES ON THE SAME PAGE WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE ISSUE ALERT WARNINGS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'LL PROVIDE EVERY OF THE ABILITY FOR ALL THOSE AGENCIES TO RECEIVE GENERATE AND VIEW ALERT AND WARNINGS -- BYE BYE -- INC. MOVING TO THIS NEXT YEAH IT ALSO WILL INCLUDE REDUNDANT CONNECTIONS AT EVERY PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT THOSE ARE OUR NINE ONE ONE CENTERS. REDUNDANT CONNECTIONS USING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY MIKE MICROWAVE NETWORK OR WE CALL CAPS THAT. ARE TO ENSURE THE CONNECTIVITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE BACK WALL THE STORIES THE FIRE SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE IS WERE WORKING TO TRY TO BUILD IN THOSE REDUNDANCIES THAT AREN'T. NECESSARILY BEING DONE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN'T WAIT GOT TO DO IT HAVE TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY THERE WHEN WE NEED IT AND SO -- AGAIN IT'S NOT ADVOCATING THEIR ROLE I WANT TO PARTNER IT'S IMPORTANT WE PARTNER BUT IN THE ABSENT OF THAT TO BUILD IN THE NIGHT -- ONE ENHANCEMENTS THIS IS THIS IS ONE KEY AREA THAT WILL ENSURE FOR REDUNDANCY -- THIS WILL ALSO REDUCE THE THAN THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM DOWN TIME -- WHICH WHICH IS KIND OF AN ONGOING PROBLEM -- WITH AGING INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THE NEXT GENERATION I WANT ONE REALLY -- IS KIND OF EXCITING IT'S A NECESSARY STEP TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL SYSTEM -- AND DOT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT IT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO NOTE TO SECURE THAT NEXT AND I ONE WANTED TO UPGRADE OUR NINE ONE SYSTEM -- THERE IS A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE TO AND AND THE WHEN WE NEED TO PASS THAT. NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE REFORM THAT'S PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE I'M URGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT TRAILER BILL IT'S A SMALL. AMOUNT BUT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN THE BIG SCOPE OF THINGS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE -- ARE AT THAT THE FORWARD. NOW STARTING WITH COMMUNICATIONS ALL JUST BACK UP AND TALK ABOUT -- OF ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND IT WAS MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES HERE AS AN ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE NESS NECESSITY. TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND PREPARE FOR AND AND WE COVER AND THAT IS IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY AND A MUCH MORE -- OF AFFECTED WAY -- I MENTIONED BRIEFLY ALERT AND WARNING -- THE ALERT MORNING STE -- GUIDELINES THAT REALLY GREW OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES -- WE'VE HAD COUNTIES -- USING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF ALERT WARNING METHOD DOT MET MYTHOLOGY METHODOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS. AND WHAT WE WERE DOING HERE IS TO TRY TO TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT AND BUILD CONSISTENCY IN TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY AND MESSAGING AND CONSISTENCY AND WHEN AND HOW THE ISSUE -- THOSE OF A WARNING SO -- YES THEY PUT TOGETHER A A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT GROUP FROM -- AB PUT TOGETHER UNDER THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ALERT MORNING COMMITTEE -- WAS MADE UP OF VARIOUS STATE LOCAL AND INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO CREATE THOSE GUIDELINES -- AND THAT REALLY MET -- SB EIGHT THREE THREE WHICH WAS -- SENATOR MAGUIRE'S BILL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON THE GUIDELINES REPRESENT THAT COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THAT STATEWIDE GUIDELINE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING. AND ENCOURAGING CONSISTENT APPLICATIONS OF THOSE WARNINGS -- AS OF MARCH TWENTY SECOND THOSE GUIDELINES WERE PUBLISHED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT -- COUNTIES IN PUBLIC. AS A PART OF THAT WE ENCOURAGE THE USE OF WE ARE THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM -- IT'S USED THE SAND -- TEXTILE MESSAGES -- TO WE ARE CAPABLE MOBILE DEVICES DURING EMERGENCY -- THAT'S IT INTEGRATED PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM I PAUSE WHICH IS A FEDERAL SYSTEM WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THAT -- BEING ABLE TO SEND THOSE MESSAGES OUT ALL CELL PHONES WHETHER YOU'RE OPTING IN OR OPTING OUT OR TRAVELING THROUGH AN AREA -- VISITOR TO THE AREA IF YOU'RE IN THE TARGET ZONE WHERE THAT MESSAGE IS BEING PUSHED OUT YOUR GOING TO GET THE MESSAGE -- HOWEVER WE ARE YOU KNOW WE IS NOT OF NOT THE HOLY GRAIL OF ALERT AND AND WARNINGS -- IT ALSO HAS LIMITATIONS -- THERE SOME CHARACTER RESTRICTIONS -- THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF BLEED OVER AND IF YOU'RE NOT ON UP -- A COMPLIANT. IPHONE OR OR A ANDROID THEY CAN CAN TAKE THESE KIND OF MESSAGES LIKE IF YOU'RE ON AN OLD STAR FLIP FLORA CENTER YOU MAY NOT BE GETTING THESE MESSAGES. SO WE NEED TO LOOK AND AND EXPAND -- MULTIPLE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OF BEING ABLE TO SEND EMERGENCY MESSAGING -- INCLUDING EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM - PUSHING OUT INFORMATION VIA -- TV AND AND RADIO -- AND ALSO -- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PUTTING SIRENS AND AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR MESSAGES -- HOWEVER WE GET THE MESSAGE OUT IS IT IS IMPORTANT AS LONG AS IS CONSISTENT AND AND AND MEET SOME CRITERIA -- AND IF YOU'RE GONNA USE IRAN'S THERE HAS TO BE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND TRAINING -- THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS OUR ABILITY TO GET GREATER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. SO. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN AN EVENT LIKE A FAST MOVING FIRE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS ON THE GROUND IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE MUTUAL AID ASSETS THAT ARE RESPONDING IN. IT'S CRITICAL FOR US AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. RIGHT NOW IN MANY CASES THESE FAST MOVING FIRES ARE MOVING SO FAST OR COMPLEX -- WHAT KIND OF BLIND IN THE FIRST FIRST HOURS OF THIS RIGHT AND -- AND WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING AND SO PART OF THAT CAN BE DRIVEN BY INCREASING THE MUCH OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE MENTIONED HERE. TODAY BUT ALSO -- IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT -- WITH WITH -- WITH -- WE ASSN AND CAL FIRE WE HAVE -- BUILT OUT SOMETHING CALLED SCOUT ITS THE SITUATION ALL COLLABORATIVE -- TOOL -- FOR FOR IF DECISIVE STANCE FOR ROB [inaudible] SITUATIONAL GUYS THE RIVERS AS FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS A FIX. COOPERATE COMMON OPERATING -- PICTURE THANK YOU SORRY -- THIS THIS TOOL REALLY IS -- IT IT'S A VITAL -- CAPABILITY FOR BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. PIECES OF INFORMATION COMING INTO THE FIELD. IT HAS THE ABILITY TO BRING IN. THE CAMERAS THAT ARE BEEN TALKED ABOUT THE SATELLITE DATA -- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO TRACK OF FIRE APPARATUS AND RESOURCES THAT ARE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO RECENTLY CAL FIRE PUT AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATORS ON ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT -- YESES BUT AUTOMATIC VEHICLES A LOCATOR ON THE SHOW A QUICK MINUTE WE CAN SEE THOSE STRIKE TEAMS MOVING AND MUCH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HAS THAT WE ARE WORKING TO GET THAT ON TO THE REST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- THROUGH THE EFFORTS THAT. ARE PUT FORTH IN A PRE POSITIONING CAPABILITY -- CURRENTLY THAT THAT SCOUT IS USED IN THE FIELD IN THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS AS WELL AS AT THE STATE LEVEL -- IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER -- TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS USING IT FACTORS SOME CLOSER NOW 200-0 USERS UNDER SCALP -- AND REALLY THAT IT'S BEEN A A GREAT STEP FORWARD TO BE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS REAL TIME -- SITUATION AWARENESS BUT IT IS AGAIN NOT THE SILVER BULLET AND WE CONTINUE TO BUILD. ON ALL OF THAT -- SEVERAL OTHER AREAS THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN EVALUATING -- IMPLEMENTING -- THAT HAVE A A CRITICAL COMPONENT -- YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE CAMERAS THERE'S ALSO THE ABILITY TO DO -- DATA DATA MINING IT'S THE ABILITY TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN IN BEING ABLE -- TO RAPIDLY ASSESS -- DATA THAT MAY BE -- CAPTURED BY INDIVIDUALS PUSHING INFORMATION OUT ON THE SCENE. CITIZENS THROUGH TWITTER OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS WHERE WE CAPTURE THAT INFORMATION AND THEN AND THEN WE ARE PUT INTO AN ALGORITHM TO BE ABLE TO GIVES US SOME. IDEA ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN A VERY FAST AND AFFECTED MANNER -- IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO ALSO LOOK AT WHETHER -- WE'VE ALSO MOVED FORWARD NOT JUST OUTSIDE A WILDFIRE BUT UNDER TECHNOLOGY WITH EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING FLOOD MONITORING TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS IN RADIOLOGIC DETECTION. IS A LOT OF INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY HAPPENING AND OF COURSE -- EARTHQUAKE. EARLY WARNING. ALERT AND WARNING TO THE PUBLIC -- THE ABILITY TO USE SCOUT AND COMMUNICATE ALL COMES BACK TO THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SOUND AND SOLID TELECOMMUNICATIONS BACK BACK BOND. NOW LET ME JUST TRANSFER IT TALKING ABOUT OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM SINCE SEVENTEEN BUT WE HAVE FAR MORE TO GO -- THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WHICH MANAGED BY -- YES IS -- IS -- NOT JUST THE FIRE SYSTEM IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM IT'S A IT'S A MERCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM -- IT'S AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- AND IF IT BELT BUCKLE BUT ABOUT -- SOME OF THE RESPONSE -- TO THE EIGHTEEN FIRES TO GET CONTEXT ON HOW THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM OPERATED. AND REALLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RECORDED ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND RESOURCES THROUGH THE FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM -- THAT INCLUDED A ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE STRIKE TEAMS AND TEN THOUSAND SIXTY FOUR SIX HUNDRED FORTY SIX ENGINES AND OVER TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WATER TENDERS. COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PERIOD -- THE SYSTEM IS. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT [inaudible] BACKBONE SYSTEM -- CAL FIRE PARTICIPATES IN THAT SYSTEM AS DO ALL THE OTHER FIRE DEPARTMENTS A CAL FIRE IS ALSO A USER OF THE SYSTEM. ON A CAL FIRE INCIDENT THEY WILL TURN TO THE SYSTEM AND REQUEST ASSETS TO BE ABLE TO GET. THOSE RESOURCES THERE -- IN SUPPORT OF THE FIRE THOSE RESOURCES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY COORDINATED AND OBTAINED. THROUGH REGION -- FORMATTING SO THAT WE'VE GOT WE DON'T DRAW DOWN ALL OF ONE PART OF THE STATE BUT WE WE WE CAREFULLY STRATEGICALLY MOVE THOSE RESOURCES AND THEY COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. PONIES UP RESOURCES IN A STRIKE TEAM FORMAT OF FIVE ENGINES OR CELL AND THEN WE WE MOVE THEM INTO AREAS AND AT TIMES AS I MENTIONED ALL THOSE FIRES IT TOOK PLACE IN. IN EIGHTEEN WE HAD. HUNDREDS OF FIRE ENGINES AND THOUSANDS OF FIREFIGHTERS MOVING ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SIMULTANEOUSLY -- TO MANAGE THOSE THOSE THOSE FIRES -- IN ADDITION -- SOMETIMES WE GET OVERWHELMED -- AND WE KNOW THAT THESE FIRES SINCE THERE ARE SO COMPLEX AND AND HAVE BECOME SO. EXTREME THAT WE NEED TO GO OUT OF STATE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT THROUGH THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT OR STATE TO STATE MUTUAL AID -- AND IN THE CASE OF THE FIRESIN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ENGINES FROM STATES ALL OVER WESTERN UNITED STATES. AND WE ACTUALLY WENT TO TWO COUNTRIES -- AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND -- AS WELL AS GOING TO OUR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SUPPORT THOSE. IN ADDITION WE HAD -- LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID FROM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- OVER THOUSAND ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SIX DIFFERENT STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THREE DIFFERENT FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SUPPORTING AND OF COURSE AS GENERAL BALL IMAGINE A TREMENDOUS COMPONENT -- BY THE NATIONAL GUARD WHICH THE NATIONAL GUARD -- FOR FEELS MANY. MANY. FUNCTIONS DURING A DISASTER NOT JUST SUPPORTING THE WILDFIRE FIREFIGHTING BUT SECURITY LOGISTICS SUPPORT MEDICAL SUPPORT -- THERE ARE TREMENDOUS ACTION ARM -- SUPPORT -- TO THE STATE IN THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT CIVIL AUTHORITY -- ONE OTHER IN IN A KEY IMPROVEMENT TO THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND CHIEF GOSSLER MENTIONED IT -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS OUR ABILITY TO PRE POSITION. RESOURCES IN FRONT OF OF A POSSIBLE MAJOR FOOTBALL AND FIRE SITUATION. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A MENTION. CHIEF GAZA MENTION IT TOOK A FEW HOURS TO GET THE REASON SHE CALLED FOR THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN DESIGNED -- TO BE A A FEEL KIND OF SYSTEM OTHER WORDS LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO AN EVENT -- OR CAL FIRE RESPONSE TO SOMETHING A STATE RESPONSIBILITY LAND. THEY MANAGE IT THEY REALIZE IT BECOMES. BROADER OR MORE COMPLEX THEY NEED ASSETS THEY PUT THE REQUEST IN THE REQUEST GOES THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND IT'S PHIL. THERE IS A LAG TIME. TODAY WE'RE SEEING IN THE EXTREME NATURE OF THESE EVENTS THAT THAT WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE GAP OF THAT LAG TIME THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR SAYING HE HAD TO WAIT FOR A FEW HOURS. AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS REALLY. TO GO BACK TO TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING SO WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE. FIRE WEATHER -- FUELS CONDITION -- INTELLIGENCE ARE ON UP FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY CLIMATOLOGY -- AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HER CHIEF GOZER MUCH TIME SEVERAL TIMES FUSION FUSION CENTER IT'S REALLY THIS ABILITY THROUGH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS THE THE INCIDENT. LOOKING AT THE WEATHER DATA. I'M LOOKING AT THE TOPOGRAPHY ASSESSING THE FIRE CORRIDORS PASS FIRE HISTORY. AND THEN BEING ABLE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS -- UP THROUGH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WHERE WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE STATE WIDE PICTURE TO SAY LOOK THIS IS A HIGH POTENTIAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A FIRE SO NOW WHEN THERE'S A RED FLAG CONDITION. WHERE THEY USED TO SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA OF A RED FLAG CONDITION IT'S GOING TO BE OVER EIGHT COUNTIES WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? A RED FLAG CONDITION OVER A COUNTIES WITH THIS. EFFORT IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE MOVING IT IS TO BRING THAT. THAT WHETHER THREATEN DOWN TO THOSE KEY AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL. FOR FIRE STARTS SO WHERE THE WINDS ARE GOING TO BE THE WORST WERE THE FEW CONDITIONS ARE THE WORST WITH THE HUMIDITY IS THE LOWEST WITH THE TEMPERATURES THE HIGHEST. ECCENTRIC AND WE TIE THE CAMERAS IN ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT AND IT'S THAT POINT. EVEN PRIOR TO THE FIRE STARTING AT THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT THE REQUEST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO TO MOVE. TO PREVENTIVE AT WE WILL PRE POSITION -- ASSETS -- INTO -- AN AREA AND WE DID THAT ALMOST A HUNDRED TIMES -- THIS LAST YEAR -- AND IN FACT -- SOME SOME VERY -- POSITIVE SUCCESS STORIES IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. IN PLACE STANDING BY IN ADVANCE AND AND IN EACH CASE -- EVENTS HAPPENED WHERE WE ACTUALLY MOVED ARE WE SURFACTANTS IN SANTA BARBARA ONE OF THE FIRST ONES WE DID -- WE HAD A A STRIKE TEAM STAGED -- AT THE CATHEDRAL OAKS FIRE STATION -- WHEN THERE WAS A SON DOWN A WIN CONDITION THE FIRE STARTED THE STRIKE THE RESPONSE TO THE HOLIDAY FIRE AND THEY WOULD LITERALLY ON C. WITHIN MINUTES? OF THAT WAS AN AUGMENTATION TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT RESPONDED AND THESE ARE JUST FIRE STRIKE TEAMS THESE -- FIREFIGHTERS FIRE ENGINES HELICOPTERS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND IN OTHER KINDS OF THREATS WE MOVE SWIFT WATER RESCUE TEAMS URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS WHATEVER THE NEEDS ARE WE CAN PRE POSITION AND IT'S A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. IN OUR ABILITY -- TO TO BUILD THE CAPABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE NEW NORM -- SO IN PLANNING TRAINING IN AND EXERCISES -- THERE IS A LOT HAPPENING WE GUARDING -- WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COUNTERPARTS NOT JUST IN FIRE BUT IN THE OTHER DISCIPLINES WE HAVE MUTUAL AID REGIONAL COORDINATION MEETINGS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AT OUR CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE -- WORKING WITHOUT A WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS DOING OF EXCEPTIONAL NUMBER OF TRAINING AND EXERCISES -- TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO SPEED WITH REGARDS -- TO THE ABILITY. TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND. BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO -- AS WE CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THE THREAT AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS WITH. LOSING SIGHT THAT WE OFFER EARTHQUAKE FAULTS AND OTHER KINDS OF RISKS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE -- BALANCING THAT OUT AND LOOKING AT FROM ALL HAS OUR PERSPECTIVE ONE KEY AREA THAT WE ARE -- HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IS THE ISSUE OF HAZARD MITIGATION. AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS AS YOU AS YOU ALL KNOW -- EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED HAZARD MITIGATION -- RESULTS AN AVERAGE OF SIX DOLLARS SAVED -- PREVENTING THE LOSS OR PREVENTING DAMAGE FROM A DISASTER AND SO WE WORK -- EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO GET -- AS MANY -- HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS IN PLACE -- BEFORE THE EVENT PRE DISASTER MITIGATION BUT THE WAY THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS WHICH IS REALLY FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE GET UP 220%. OF THE COST OF A FEDERAL DISASTER AFTER THE DISASTER TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND BY DOWN THE RISK OF FUTURE DISASTER LOSSES SO YOU CAN IMAGINE FOURTEEN PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION IS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE'VE HAD A LOT OF MONEY COMING INTO THE STATE WITH REGARDS -- TO ABILITY TO DO -- DISASTER MITIGATION CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS SO -- IN A GOOD FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PROJECTS -- THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TOTALING CLOSE THE THREE OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THEY DID EVERYTHING FROM. HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUILDER HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS -- TO DOING A ROACH IN CONTROL AND SELL STABILIZATION AFTER THE FIRE AREA TO DOING -- PROJECTS TO REDUCE WALL FIRE RISK -- MANY OF THE SAME AREAS THAT WERE AROUND THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY CAL FIRE -- IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT -- INCLUDED -- OTHER KINDS OF THREATS AS WELL BEYOND ALL WHILE FIRE. HAZARD MITIGATION IS A KEY. AREA THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING AND WE WANT TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVERAGE MORE -- IN ADDITION. ALL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH UTILITIES -- THE IOUS IN THE RECENT MONTHS -- TO GET THEM TO FOCUS ON A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT -- OF PREPAREDNESS AND PLANNING -- THAT INCLUDES A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND AND DOING PUBLIC EDUCATION -- WITH WITH THAT WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WITH. PEOPLE IN GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA -- TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE BUT THE OUGHT TO ALSO SHARE. THIS CONCEPT OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOT OFFICE. IT IS NOT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS SUMMER -- IN THE HEIGHT OF OUR SUMMER SEASON THE HEIGHT A WILDFIRE THAT THE THE UTILITIES COULD POTENTIALLY SHUT OFF THE POWER MULTIPLE TIMES -- AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT SIMILAR KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE SAME THING WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE DO OUR PRE POSITIONING. IS A COORDINATED EFFORT RIGHT SO -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING -- COLLECTIVELY CAL FIRE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND AND YES WITH UTILITIES TO BE ABLE -- TO STANDARDIZED -- AND AND GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH TERMINOLOGY WITH WITH THE STEPS THAT THEY TAKE OUT IN THE ANALYSIS THEY MAKE ON THE SCIENCE SIDE -- THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE NORTHERN AND% SOUTHERN GEOGRAPHIC AREA OPERATIONS CENTER AND IF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER SO IT IS ALL ON THE SAME PAGE -- IN THIS EFFORT TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND ARE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD RECENTLY -- PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON YOUR RADIO -- TALKING ABOUT -- PUBLIC SERVICE A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOP -- THAT'S THE FIRST OF THE PUBLIC -- AWARENESS CAMPAIGN THAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING AND THERE'S MORE GOING TO BE COMING HERE IN THE IN THE COMING COUPLE WEEKS WITH THE I. DIGITAL PUSH OUT IT IMMEDIATE EXCEPT TRUCK -- AND REALLY THIS FOCUS ON HOW INDIVIDUALS HOW PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE INDIVIDUALS ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL THESE EXCEPT A NEED TO BE PREPARED. LASTLY -- THE GOVERNOR -- IS -- SETTING UP FOR A OF ALL CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SUMMIT WHICH REALLY WILL BE FOCUSED ON LOCAL -- AND REGIONAL COUNTY GOVERNMENT -- TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TO STEP UP THE ROLE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WORK ON BUILDING CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- TO SAYS BE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT TO THE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT WERE HAPPENING THE TRANSITIONS EVERYTHING FROM PLANNING. TO RESPONSE INTO RECOVERY AND THAT SUMMIT -- WILL BE -- SCHEDULE HERE FOR EARLY EARLY JUNE -- AND AND A VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT pTHE OTHER THING THE GOVERNOR AS DONE AS YOU KNOW -- IN THE BUDGET WAS TO ALLOCATE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON PREPAREDNESS GRANTS FOR LOCALS AND AREAS UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY. WITH REGARDS -- TO NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS GROUPS LIKE CERTAIN LEAST DOES -- TO BE ABLE -- TO FURTHER BILL THE CAPACITY FOR THOSE PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT -- GENERALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU KNOW DON'T GET THE MESSAGING MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. AS PREPARED -- FOR A DISASTER AS POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- UP THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING -- IN THE PREPAREDNESS -- AREA -- THIS IS NOT A SOUL GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS A HALL OF COMMUNITY ALL OF US -- AND U. S. TRUSTED AGES IN YOUR COMMUNITIES HAVE SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS -- AND AS I SAY IT IS A ONE TEAM. ONE FIGHT EFFORT -- MOVING FORWARD SO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR THAT REALLY COMPREHENSIVE PRESENTATION LOVE NO NO STONE UNTURNED ALMOST -- ALTERNATE OVER TO MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. SENATE JACKSON. WELL I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT IT IS NOON BUT THE ONE THAT CAN. REALLY STRIKES ME IS THIS NOTION THAT -- THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT PENDING FIRES IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HANDS. AND I'M I'VE BEEN DOING SOME LEGISLATION ON THIS WE'RE WE'RE MEETING INCREDIBLE RESISTANCE. AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM. IF THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN GET THEM TO PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME THEY'VE GOT. VIRTUALLY A MONOPOLY ON WIRELESS. REGARDLESS WHAT COMPANY IT IS IT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE GET THEM TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE WAY TO GO OR ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU BEEN HAVING HOW DO WE GET THEM TO STEP UP. AND HELP PROTECT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO PAY -- FOR THEIR SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE PROFITS THAT THEY REAP [inaudible] WELL. THANK YOU CENTER IT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- LET ME ANY KIND OF SAY THAT I I I I I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY'RE DOING NOTHING -- YOU KNOW THEY BAY WHERE THEY AT CAN I THINK THAT THEY ARE -- WORKING ON DOING HARDENING OF SOME OF THEIR FACILITIES -- I THINK -- I COULDN'T TELL YOU THE SPEED OR THE OR THE THAT HOW HOW MUCH OF THAT THAT'S HAPPENING -- THEY HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. CONNECTIVITY AND LINK INTO THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WE BRING THEM INTO THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. AS A PART OF OUR STATE'S RESPONSE OPERATION -- THEY HAVE COMMITTED ON PROVIDING -- CELLULAR ON WHEELS AND OTHER KINDS OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS -- BUT IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS AND UP I THINK MOVING FORWARD -- BUT PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY AYE AYE AYE TAKEN AND JUST IN GENERAL IS IS IS WORKING -- BRINGING THEM AROUND THE TABLE -- TO REALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THEM SOME OF THESE ON GOING CHALLENGES IT CONCERNS WE HAVE AND AND AND AND YOU KNOW. I'D I THINK IN SOME CASES OTHERS WERE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER AND THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE AND WE'VE DONE THAT WITH OTHER. OTHER UTILITIES VERY SUCCESSFULLY -- BECAUSE THEY ARE A CRITICAL CRITICAL ASSET TO THIS OVERALL PICTURE. SO WITH THAT IN MIND ENOUGH AND ALL STOP THIS QUESTION I ONLY HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MORE BUT I'LL I'LL STOP THIS -- ONE THE UTILITIES WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE -- REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE TELEVISION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THEIR PROCESS ALL IN I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WHICH BROUGHT IN THE STATE OF THE ART. EQUIPMENT PEOPLE THEY'VE REALLY. TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION THAT THAT KIND OF HELD THEM. TO TO PAY FOR THE LACK OF THIS KIND OF CONCERN MANY YEARS AGO BUT THEY HAVE STEPPED UP. AND THEY HAVE STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE -- WEATHER SYSTEMS IN EVERY HILL SIDE THAT THAT IS IN A HIGH RISK AREA. AND I'M WONDERING IF NOW ASSUMING THAT THE OTHER UTILITIES PARTICULARLY P. JEANNIE ARE TAKING SERIOUSLY THAT THEY DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ALL THIS THEY'RE DOING THAT KIND OF WORK. IS THERE SOME WAY TO WE NEED TO DO LEGISLATION. IS REGULATION I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS TO INCORPORATE IN SO THAT WE DON'T REPLICATE ARE UNNECESSARILY -- DUPLICATE I SHOULD SAY. A LOT OF THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'RE BRINGING TO THE TABLE IS THERE IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO OR SHOULD BE DOING OR OR NOT DOING I MEAN. THERE MAY BE. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT HERE'S ALL THIS NEW EQUIPMENT THE HOT THE BEST AND THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING ONLINE. VIA THE UTILITY COMPANIES IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN GET THEM -- INCORPORATED IN COLLABORATING WITH THE STATE WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH OUR LOCAL FOLKS. TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE IN THE USE OF THAT STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY IN NOTIFYING THE PUBLIC WARNING US IN ADVANCE FIGHTING THE FIRES DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. SUCH AS FIRES BUT YOU KNOW SOME THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A EARTHQUAKE IN THIS STATE AND JUST INEVITABLE AND AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET. THE KIND OF ADVANCED SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE WHOLE INTEGRATED PROGRAM TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK IMMIGRATION OF ALL THESE ALL THESE EFFORTS IS I MEAN WE WORK WITH UTILITIES. WEEKLY WERE HAVING MEETINGS WITH THEM. TO ADDRESS JUST THIS ISSUE -- I WOULD SAY THAT -- AND TOM COULD WEIGH INTO HERE -- AYE DAVE WE WE'VE WE'VE. WE'VE BROUGHT A LOT OF THAT. TO A PLACE WHERE. WERE ALL ON THIS SIMILAR PAGE. THE CENTER IS NOT YET A 100% BAIT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE IT -- AND THEY'RE OUT LIARS THAT STILL NEED TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE INTO THE FOLD BUT I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNED EXTENSIVELY -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT -- YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE CAPABLE HOW THE JOINT CAPABILITY WORKS AND THEN HOW WE CAN BRING IT. INTO THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO PUSH IT BACK OUT -- IT IS A VERY COMPLEX -- SET OF OF CHALLENGES -- IN A STATE THE SIZE WITH THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT I UTILITIES IN THE TOPOGRAPHY EXCEPTION BUT I DON'T. YEAH I I JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THAT THAT -- THE GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATION CENTERS THE GAC IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH -- READING AND AND IN RIVERSIDE IN THIS CASE -- THEIR JOINTLY OPERATED -- CAL FIRE -- BUT THERE FEDERAL THROUGH THE U. S. FOR SERVICE -- PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE GAPS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES -- BUT WE HAVE TO IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE UNIQUE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT HAS ACTUALLY -- TO AND THEIR UNIQUE TO US -- THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE GATHERING WILL RELATED TO FIRE WEATHER AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS IS THE SAME DATA THAT'S BEING USED BY THESE UTILITY COMPANIES -- WHAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY'RE USING THAT DATA? TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS SO -- THERE'S MORE COORDINATION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH ON THAT -- BUT FOR THE TIME BEING. THE INFORMATION THAT'S COMING INTO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WEATHER SO -- SERVICE AND AND COORDINATION CENTERS IS THE SAME DATA BECAUSE THAT'S THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THE BROAD PICTURE OF WEATHER. AS TIME GOES ON WE NEED TO MAINTAIN -- THAT GOVERNMENTAL CONNECTION TO WHERE THE DATA IS COMING FROM AND BE ABLE -- TO COORDINATE HOW -- HOW WE'RE USING THAT DATA BUT DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO TURN OFF -- POWER FOR INSTANCE ARE BEING MADE BY. THE UTILITY COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THEY'RE JUST LOOKING AT IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIRTY GALGIANI QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CAN I HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW THE TWO PRIOR PANELS AND AND YOU GENTLEMAN SPOKE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO INTERACT WITH OUR REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MITIGATION OF RISK AND WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THAT AT THIS POINT SIMPLY COMES DOWN. TO A MATTER OF RESOURCES AND TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT AS THE MAP INDICATES 58%. OF FOREST LAND IN THIS STATE IS FEDERALLY RESPONSIBILITY. AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW OUR PRESIDENT HAS ADVOCATED FOR A MORE ROBUST WREAKING PROGRAM. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD -- SPEAK TO WHAT ADDITIONALLY WE MIGHT BE DOING AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN SUPPORT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN MITIGATING RISK IN THOSE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS. OKAY AGAIN TOM PORTER -- CAL FIRE DIRECTOR -- SEVERAL THINGS -- WE ARE WORKING AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE WITH OUR OUR COUNTERPARTS -- AT REGION FIVE FOR SERVICE OF REGION FIVE AS CALIFORNIA AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS -- BUT AS AS RECENTLY AS THIS MORNING BEFORE COMING HERE -- I'VE BEEN IN CON A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENTS AND GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY IN THESE ARE ALL ALL DIFFERENT ADORED USE THAT THAT WE CAN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE THE U. S. FOR SERVICE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO DO. JOINT FUELS PROJECT WORK -- TO DO FOREST RESILIENCE WORK AND AND THE RESILIENCE WORK IS REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE LONG TERM TURNING THE TIDE. GETTING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND SO THOSE ARE THE IT PLACES WHERE WHERE THE FOR SERVICE -- REALLY COMES INTO PLAY -- ANOTHER THING THAT'S THAT'S INTERESTING AND AND I WILL SAY ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. IS OF THE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND I MEAN MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN EXPANDED THUS FAR. IN -- FOREST RESILIENCE AND FORCED HEALTH PROJECT WORK FROM MY PREVIOUS -- PRESENTATION -- ABOUT. 51% OF THAT HAS BEEN EXPENDED ON FEDERAL LAND OR WILL BE EXPENDED ON FEDERAL LAND ON FOREST SERVICE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE IN -- COLLABORATION -- PUTTING ON THE LANDSCAPE IN ORDER TO PROTECT. THE LIVES PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING IS INVESTING IN ALL LANDS WITH ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN THE LANDSCAPE BASED ON THE THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THOSE PROJECTS TO THE RESOURCES AND PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS I THINK WE GETS A WEEK WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THOSE COLOR BOUNDARIES INSTEAD WERE FOCUSING ON AREAS OF RISKING KEEPING OUR POPULATIONS SAFE REGARDLESS OF THE FEDERAL. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY AND STEPPING UP TO WHAT IS THIS NEW NORMAL CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS MAKING ALL OF YOUR JOBS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING AND RISKY SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S BEEN. THE FOCUS BUT AGAIN IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO AND HELPING FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THOSE -- AGREEMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FEDERAL PROPERTY IS MAINTAINED TO A LEVEL THAT KEEPS OUR CITIZENS SAFE THAT SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WE'RE ALL HAPPY. TO ENGAGE IN. THAT SAID IS ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM THIS FINAL PANEL. ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACTION ITEMS TO FOLLOW UP WITH ALL ALLOW MY VICE CHAIR SOME CLOSING REMARKS WHICH IS LIKE SURE VERY BRIEF I WANT TO THANK YOU AND SEEING YOU HEARING GEAR SO AFTER THE LITERALLY THE THE SMOKE IS CLEARED FROM OUR EYES FROM MARK. A MAJOR FIRE IN -- THE BEEN TURNED SANTA BARBARA AREA YOU YOU WERE INCREDIBLE -- AND I KNOW EVERYONE OF MY COMMUNITY APPRECIATED AND THEN OF COURSE GOING FORWARD SO FIRES ARE. ACTUALLY I HATE TO CALL THE NEW NORMAL IT'S NEW ABNORMAL AND TO APPRECIATE. THE DISCUSSION BOTH FROM THE LOCAL UP THROUGH THE STATE NATIONAL LEVEL -- IN ALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOING A COUPLE MY TAKEAWAYS IF I MAY AND AND I'D LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THEM. IS OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WE'VE GOT A IT'S GONNA GET QUICKER AND AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IS. JUST GETTING MUTUAL AID COMING FORWARD AND PERHAPS THIS IS PART OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ISSUE THAT WE ARE. DEALING WITH WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE THE RESPONSES MORE QUICKLY I KNOW IN SOME AREAS YOU GOT TO GET APPROVAL FIRST BUT THAT FIRES COMING IN AN ACRE A SECOND YOU DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO GET THAT APPROVAL. MAYBE THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE MOVING QUITE AS FAST -- THAT'S SOMETHING I I YOU KNOW HOPE THAT WE CAN HELP HELP YOU WITH BUT THE THE KEY THING -- AGAIN COMMUNICATIONS THE WORKING WITH THE UTILITIES THEY HAVE GOT TO BE A PARTNER HERE -- IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT THE WIRELESS COMPANIES SAID THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF EARLY ADVANCED WARNING WAS SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED DRESSING RIGHT IS LITERALLY THE THOMAS FIRE BROKE OUT. WE WEREN'T DOING ENOUGH UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE PEOPLE WERE NOT GETTING OUT QUICKLY ENOUGH TO WARRANT BEING NO NOTIFIED. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DIFFERENT I'M CONCERNED THERE IN THE PROPAGANDA THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY HOLD THE KEY. WE JUST DON'T USE CHURCH BELLS ANYMORE FOR THESE KINDS A WARNING SO -- I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND BRING THEM TO THE TABLE I'M NOT SURE. WHAT THE INCENTIVES ARE WITH THE HOW WE GO ABOUT IT BUT I KNOW THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN? DOING YOUR BEST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SAY PROPERTY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY -- HUMAN LIFE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE DISCUSSIONS I WANNA THANK THE CHAIR OF FOR HER WORK AND STAFF -- FOR ALL OF US HERE DID THIS IS JUST. AGENCIES AND PARTY CALIFORNIA'S DNA AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND. EFFECTIVELY THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTING IT THEY DESERVE NOTHING LASSEN AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON AYE. CONCUR WITH HER COMMENTS AND AND SUMMARY OF AREAS AND I THINK -- POINTS TO GO TO THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK OUT AS WE MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD PARTICULARLY AROUND BRINGING IN THE TELECOM -- COMMUNITY TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM BUT I ALSO THINK CRITICALLY WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT STAFFING BECAUSE WE CAN PAY FOR STAFFING NOW OR WE CAN PAY FOR REBUILDING LATER.
