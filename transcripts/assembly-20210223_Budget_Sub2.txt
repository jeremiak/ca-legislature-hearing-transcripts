AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS THIS YEAR FROM ENROLLMENT FROM JUST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE KNOW THAT. PANDEMIC HAND IMPACTS LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR EVEN MORE. AND THIS OF COURSE THE LARGEST SEGMENT EVER COMMUNICATE SYSTEM YESTERDAY WE DID STEP UP AND PROVIDE A MORE FINANCIALLY IN SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT. IS THAT IS A BIG EFFORT AS WELL AS AS WELL WE STEPPED UP TO PROVIDING HELP TO GET- SOME ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE- INTO THE CALFRESH PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW IS A PRIORITY.

FOURTEEN PROP NINETY EIGHT HOW THE IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- YOU KNOW WE FOR ONE OF FOCUS ON MAKE SURE THE COLLEGES REMAIN WHOLE- BUT ALSO FOCUSED ON THE STUDENTS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS- SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALL THE OTHER PIECES THAT. FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS- OTHER PROGRAMS IN OUR VERY AN INFLUENTIAL AND IMPORTANT ARE THE MESA PLENTY OF MODE YOUR PROGRAMS- THIS EMERGING PROGRAM THE RISING SCHOLARS WHICH IS AT ITS CAMPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHEN I TAKE A LOOK AT EXPANDING THAT- AS WELL ANOTHER PIECE THAT'S RELATED TO- COMMUNICATE JUST AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THEIR CALTRANS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT IS- CAL GRANT REFORM- WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO. ENGAGE WITH A LASTLY WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE THE ONLINE COLLEGES THERE'S NO NEW MONEY IN THE BUDGET BUT THERE IS AN EXTREME INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC THERE IS A AUDIT COMING OUT IN A FEW WEEKS AS WELL. BY NOTE. MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS IS. BEING PLAYED OUT AS- SINCE WE'RE DOING MORE ONLINE. LEARNING ANYWAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS- SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR AGENDA. TRY TO FINISH ON TIME TODAY. SO FIRST WE HAVE ISSUE NUMBER ONE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATORS BASE FUNDING INA ROMAN AND WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. A. L. O. AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I BELIEVE WITH US. SO I SEE IT WE SAT THERE BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA START WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD MORNING SURE NEVER STAND IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FOR THE FIRST ITEM OUT THERE AND OVER OF THE- THANK BUT RELATED TO APARTMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE THE GOVERNOR QUITE BUT TEN POINT BILLION AND LOCAL THE SINCE FOR CAN YOU COLLEGE. AND ADULT THAT. IT'S A NEW ESTIMATE THAN WORK BUT FACTORS. THE GOVERNMENT BY PROJECT TOTAL COPY THAT FOR THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FOR. OF SEVEN POINT SIX SIX SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SHOP FROM THE PROJECT OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE FIVE DOLLARS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY ONE AT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET AT. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT ARE TWENTY ARE YOU TWENTY TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWO COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF ONE POINT 5% OR ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS- AND FUNDING FOR POINT 5% ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR TWENTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUIRES SEVERAL CONDITIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT UPON RECEIVING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. FEATURING COLLEGE DISTRICT- FIRST EACH CLINIC DISTRICTS HAVE. A REPORT THE SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE. ON HOW THEY PLAN TO CLOSE THE- GAPS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE VISION PERSICA. THE SECOND COMMUNITY DISTRICTS CHUCK POLICIES TO MAINTAIN. ONLINE COURSE IN PRO AT A LEVEL THAT IT PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER. THAN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETY ALL. BECAUSE THE COLLEGES OF ALL SHIPPED TO PROVIDE ONLINE ARE PROVIDING AND THAT IS ON COMPLETE THE ONLINE. AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC ADMINISTRATION BILL CONFIDENT THAT THIS GOAL IS RIGHT THAT THE. I WOULD OFTEN AT SIMILAR. FOR THE UC AND C. OR ESTABLISH AT THE GOVERNOR BUDGET WELL. ENTER OF DEFERRAL. AS YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY BY ACTIVE BIRD ONE POINT FIVE THREE. AND TWENTY ONE PORTION OF. THE GIVEN EXPECT INCREASE IN THE PROVINCE NINETY GUARANTEE. THE PROJECT THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET PROPOSAL TO REDUCE TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO FOR ALL THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE BILLION. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OF A PORTION OF. ADDITIONALLY THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TO REPAY THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FOR ALL. OF ONE POINT FOUR FIVE THREE BILLION USING SOURCES FROM MULTIPLE FISCAL YEARS. INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. FIVE HUNDRED POINT EIGHT MILLION- FROM VEHICLE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BY GETTING IT IMPLEMENTED A FOR ALL ALBEIT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL. SAID MINISTRATION IS ABLE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO TRACK ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF TOWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND HELP THEM TO THE STATE TIME. AS WELL TRY TO CATCH A THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN ROME TO. REPORTED FOR THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. I WOULD RATHER NOT HEAR THAT IMMEDIATE. PACKAGE BY THE INSTEAD INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME. THE REPORT EVERITT TO INCREASE STUDENT AND INVOLVED. ALSO HELP COLLEGES ADDRESS DECLINING COUNSELOR OF THE- WITH THAT I'M CONFIDENT ANY QUESTION ABOUT. WELCOME BACK YOU IF I. L. A. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBER. PASTI HOUSING WE ANALYSTS OFF. LAST OUR OFFICE WILL AND NOW. OF GOVERNOR. CAL COMMITTEE PROPOSED ITS TITLED THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS AND ISSUE ONE. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONE POINT 5% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR A PORTION IT'S WE KNOW IN OUR REPORT THAT DISTRICTS ARE FACING A NUMBER OF COST PRESSURES. IN THE UPCOMING. YEAR HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES ARE. ARE FACTORED PENSIONS BOB WITH COSTS REALLY RAMPING UP IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. YOU ARE ALSO IT'S HAVE JUST BASIC OPERATING COSTS ARE GOING UP- AND JUST INCREASED- PRESSURED FOR EMPLOYEE SALARIES ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT RECEIVING A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THE CALL RATE WHICH IS BASED ON A PRICE INDEX. FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE UPDATED IN APRIL AND THEN IN MAY THAT LEGISLATION WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT REVENUES ARE- AND THAT WILL IMPACT WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. SO IF ADDITIONAL. ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN MAY THE LEGISLATURE MAY I WISH TO PROVIDE AN EVEN LARGER. COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR A PORTION IT'S THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER RE PURPOSING LOWER PRIORITY PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SUPPORT A LARGER BASE OF PORTION INCREASING THROUGHOUT OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS- IN THIS HEARING- WE WILL IDENTIFY WE IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS THAT MIGHT BE GOOD CANDIDATES. FOR SUCH A REDIRECTION. WITH THREE TO THE PROPOSAL FOR DISTRICTS TO DEVELOP STUDENT EQUITY PLANS AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THEIR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WE WOULD NOTE THAT SUCH A REQUIREMENT WOULD REALLY BE REDUNDANT THIS IS BECAUSE DISTRICTS. ALREADY MUST DEVELOP AN UPDATE STUDENT EQUITY PLANS AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING STUDENT EQUITY ACHIEVEMENT CATEGORICAL FUNDS SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THAT PROPOSED CONDITION. AS REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED CONDITION ON MAKING THAT CALL OUR TO DO ONLINE INSTRUCTION MAINTAIN TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY STRIKES ISN'T ARBITRARY YOU HAVE- COASTLINE IN COLLEGE IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT'S ALREADY IT. 78% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NOT SURE WHAT'S NECESSARILY DESIRABLE ABOUT HAVING HIM STAY AT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. OUR OTHER COLLEGES HISTORICALLY DO MOSTLY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO BE MORE HANDS ON OVER THERE AND RURAL AREAS WHERE STUDENTS MIGHT HAVE LOWER INTERNET CONNECTIVITY SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING. THAT PROPOSAL. ONE OF THE PROPOSED PAY- WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK HE WOULD. HE WOULD ELIMINATE ONE ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN DEFERRALS- IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT LEAVING. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD JUST BE AN ONGOING DEFERRAL UNTIL THAT'S PAID OFF- AND WITH NO TIMELINE OF WHEN THAT MIGHT BE PAID OFF. BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK ABOUT GOING EVEN FURTHER THAN THE GOVERNOR USING ONE TIME FUNDS TO RETIRE MORE OF THESE DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE BUDGET YEAR HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES INCLUDING HELPING DISTRICTS WITH THEIR- BORROWING- THEY DON'T HAVE TO BORROW AS MUCH FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES. IT ALSO GIVES THE LEGISLATURE MORE BUDGET TOOLS TO RESPOND TO FUTURE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND WE ARE. THROUGHOUT OUR BUDGET HOUSES WE IDENTIFY LOWER PRIORITY PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE THINK COULD BE USED INSTEAD. TO PAY DOWN MORE DEFERRALS OR TO HELP DISTRICTS IN OTHER WAYS SUCH AS BY MITIGATING THEIR FUTURE PENSION COSTS INCREASED. SO THE LAST ISSUE IN THAT LAST TOPIC IN ISSUE ONE. CONCERN THIS AGREEMENT PROPOSAL. WHICH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED ZERO POINT 5% ENROLLMENT GROWTH TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. SO IT'S OF COURSE HIGHLY IN THIS POINT WHAT A MOMENT DEMAND WILL BE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OH REALLY UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED AS FAR AS A MOMENT THE FUNDING. IF COLLEGES KATE SCHOOL WHERE MANY CAN YOU AND THEIR- LARGELY REAL. THEIR PHYSICAL. IN THE FALL AND THE ECONOMY SLOW TO RECOVER. THEIR COMMITTEE COLLEGES COULD SEE A SURGE ENROLLMENT. ATTENTION ON THE OTHER HAND OF COLLEGE AND SCHOOLS REMAIN PRIMARILY.ONLINE IN THE FALL WE COULD SEE THESE CURRENT ENROLLMENT- TRENDS PERSIST. SO LATER THIS THE CHANCELLOR pOFFICE IS X. TO RE UPDATED IN. ON AND ROMAN GROWTH USE AMONG ALL OF. IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS WELL AS WILL HAVE NUMBERS WITH PRIORITY. AND BY SPRING WILL LIKELY HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT STATE AND WHAT THIS OF WHAT SCHOOL AMONG. WHERE HEADED INTO OF THEIR FOLLOW THE OPENING PLAY. SO LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH. TO USE THAT INFORMATION ALL THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE A CALL ON THE ROLE THAT FUNDING AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE CHANCELLOR OFFICE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS THE SECOND OF IT I SERVE AS THE VICE CHANCELLOR COLLEGE FINANCE AT THAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE COLLEGES I WANT TO FIRST BEGAN BY THINKING THE ASSEMBLY FOR YOUR RESPONSIVENESS IN SUPPORT OF THE EARLY ACTION BUDGET PACKAGE YOUR EFFORTS PUT STUDENTS FIRST THEY RECOGNIZE THE HARDSHIP COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACED AND WILL ENABLE OUR SYSTEM TO RESPOND QUICKLY SO THAT THE EDUCATIONAL GOALS OF THE GENERATION ARE NOT FURTHER JEOPARDIZE. SO NOW NEARLY TWELVE MONTHS INTO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE DISRUPTIONS IT'S COSTS ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR MOST CONCERNING IS THAT THE PANDEMIC THREATENS TO HAVE LINGERING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OF COLOR THIS IS WHERE WE ASK CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES CAN PLAY A CLIP ARTICLE ROLE TO SUPPORT THE ROAD TO RECOVERY AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT LEADING TO A MORE EQUITABLE. AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. WE THAT. FOR ITS GROUP THAT LAYS A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR THE POST PANDEMIC RECOVERY. SO DURING THIS CRISIS IS PROVIDING STABILITY HAS BEEN OUT OUR OFFICE IS TOP PRIORITY TO THAT END THE CHANCES OFFICE HAS USED A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL STABILITY TO DISTRICTS DURING THIS UNCERTAIN DURING. THE PRO CHOICE INCLUDED THE APPLICATION OF THE TITLE FIVE EMERGENCY CONDITION ALLOWANCES TO DISTRICTS WHOSE ENROLLMENT. WAS IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND TO PER IN AND- WHEN CALCULATE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DEFERRALS THAT WERE YOU INCLUDED FOR A SYSTEM DITION ENSURING THAT EACH DISTRICT RECEIVED AT LEAST 83% OF THEIR REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES. AND PREVENTED DISTRICTS IN LOW PROPERTY WEALTH COMMUNITIES FROM BEARING THE BURDEN OF DEFERRALS AS THE TRADITIONALLY DO. THESE ACTIONS ALSO PROVIDED SOME FINANCIAL STABILITY DURING A VERY COMPLEX PERIOD. HOWEVER THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES AND- WE KNOW THAT A RETURN TO ANY FORM OF NORMAL WILL BE DIFFICULT AND SEEMS DESTINED AND SO WE- BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO EVALUATE THE LONG TERM FISCAL RESILIENCY OF OUR SYSTEM. THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING ONGOING RESOURCES TO DISTRICTS AS THEY PREPARE FOR INCREASED COST IN RECURRING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE'S CAMPUS REOPENING PAIN DEFERRALS AND CONTINUING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH PRESENTS OUR SYSTEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO MORE INTENTIONALLY FOCUS ON AND ROLLING. AND SERVING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. IN SUPPORTING THEIR SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY. I NO THE NATIONAL EVENT OVER THE LAST YEAR HAVE COLD ASKING. TO DISMISS STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES THAT PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS SERVED AS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES NORTH STAR TO CLOSING THE GAPS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN SEVERAL PLANS THAT ARE COLLEGES ALREADY PRODUCE INCLUDING STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PLANS ARE LOW AND OUR LOCAL VISION GOALS. THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT NEW TO OUR SYSTEM BUT RATHER THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS US TO APPROACH THESE EFFORTS. MORE COHESIVELY. AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE HOUR- PER FOR CALL COULD TO GROW. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GLAD SEE SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN I'M GOING FUNDS INCLUDING A COLA AND GROWTH. WE SURELY BIT ABOUT GROW. UNDER THE S. PATH GROWTH CAN MORE THE TRADITIONAL NOTION OF INCREASED ENROLLMENTS IT CONSERVE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS OF COLLEGES THAT HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT THEY ENROLL. AND IN THE SUCCESSES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO ALL THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE WHERE POSSIBLE WE ENCOURAGE ONGOING SUPPORT- WE ENCOURAGE SUPPORT OF THE GROWTH AND WE ENCOURAGE ON GOING SUPPORT FOR- OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS. WELL WE URGE SHOULD ANY NEW RE. BECOME OF AND MAYBE. PRIORITY PLACED ON PAYING DOWN TO. SO THAT DISTRICTS ARE NOT THREATENED BY FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES M. PRESENTED BY THESE REMAINING DATS- WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER S. THE QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN THE- COMMENTS FROM THE L. A. O. VERY SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE- REDIRECTING THE RESOURCES OF UNPAID DOWN THE DEFERRALS- HOW CAN HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT IT'S CLEAR THAT TO- FOR TALKING ABOUT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE GOT ONE POINT ONE BILLION- BEING USED TO PAY IT DOWNAND WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE AND- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THE DEFERRALS- WHY CAN'T WE- CHANGE THAT- AND RE DIRECT. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE DEFERRALS. AT TEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR GUARD COMMUNICORP STUDENTS AND THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES ARE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF. IMMEDIATE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM WEATHER THE STORM OF CUT THE NINETEEN AND HELP ADDRESS YOU KNOW THEIR STUDENTS STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND SUCH SO- BY CONTINUING A SMALL BUBBLE TO FOR ALL THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION BUDGET MULTIPLE. AFTER TO SIGNAL REDUCE THAT. THANK YOU. A SMALL BUBBLE PROFIT PRESENT FOR TO USED TO BETTER THE NEED OF- STUDENTS IN COLLEGES IN THE SHOW TERM. THERE ARE. THAT ARE PRICE- AS NOTED BY THE- IS THIS SOMETHING THE ADMINS WILL COME. I THINK GIVING- YOU KNOW NEW PER. AND ALL THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO MAYOR VISION I THINK. PERHAPS TO GET THERE ARE NUMBER OF AND- THEN- AS AS WE GO INTO AMERICA'S AND I COULD CERTAINLY A BACK. IF I MAY MISTER- THE OTHER. HOW TO DO WITH THE STOOD. SUPPORT OUR BENEFITS. AND THE WAY I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I AM A- BY BY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL. TO REPAY THESE. TO AND ENCOURAGE. RECRUIT EVERY TEN. SO STILL MENTOR HEALTH AND ADDRESS BY. NEEDS SO THERE'S A LOT OF. IN THE BUT I THAT- AS WE LOOK AT THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- THE NEEDTO PROVIDE MORE PROTECTION AND MORE- MORE FUNDING. IN THE AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE NEEDED MOST. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL THE COMMUTER COLLEGES ARE RECEIVING STUDENT COMPARED IT TO THE UC SYSTEM IS ONE QUARTER- IT'S ONE THIRD OF CSU SYSTEMS AND 40% LESS THAN K. THROUGH TWELVE WE'VE GOT TWO POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNFORTUNATELY AT LEAST FROM THE NUMBERS OR RECEIVING MANY OF THEM ARE IN POVERTY AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO SO SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE STUDENT SUPPORT PROPOSALS- ELLIE- IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE DISTRICTS BE GIVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THE FUNDS. IT ISN'T THE END COMBINATION REGARDING FOOD AND HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS OF THE SPECIFIC- DISTRICT AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER. I GET IT THAT THE- AS THE VETERANS ARE GAP THAT THAT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER IT PART OF THAT THE MARRIAGE THE SENATE CERTAINLY AND I CAN'T BACK A THINK IN. THE GOVERNOR'S BY REALLY TO IDENTIFY. BASIC ME THAT WE FEEL- HAVE BEEN PRETTY IMPACT AS THERE'S OF A COMPANY IN AND ARE SORT OF ON GOING BE- PARKING IN YOUR- DID. AND THEIR OF THE BUDGET REALLY TOPICS THOSE INTERN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENING GET YOUR CAR. ABOUT HOW THE TO CHECK UP THAT GOAL. STAND ALONE THE SAME LINES IT'S CLEAR THE- WE DO. THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT. THE AYE THE COMMUTE COLLEGES SHOULD PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN A- THE CROSS. ALIGNMENT BETWEEN TWELVE. AND FOR YOUR UNIVERSE. I AGREE I AGREE WITH THIS- COMMITTEE COLLEGE WITHOUT DOUBT OUR THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE K. TWELVE. AND THE FOR YOUR- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SURE TO PROTECT THOSE STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING. FOR THEM- SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER DONNA. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES I'M PRODUCT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND JUST A COMMENT ON THE DEFERRALS- I JUST I WOULD ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO THINK OF THIS A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN FRIGHTEN CARNATIC CLAWBACK FOR SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS BUT I PREFER THAT WE PAY ATTENTION OF COAL HERE VISITING THE COAST TOO LOW FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO PUT MY FIGHT SO I JUST THINK WE SHOULD THINK. OPENLY ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THE DEFINING TOPIC BECAUSE THE CALL IS ON GOING THE FOR US WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY ONE TIME ARGUABLY SO- I AM VERY CONCERNED AT THE CALL HERE IS TOO LOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK- HAVE MORE MORE CONVERSATION. ABOUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. SOMEONE REVISED THAT AS- I WOULD AGREE THAT YOU KNOW FEDERAL FUNDS COULD FREE UP GENERAL FUNDS TO EITHER PAY DOWN DEFERRALS OR INCREASE THE COLOR SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A MEASURED APPROACH BUT BUT ALSO REALISTIC I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE- THE CURES ACT FUNDING INCLUDED TO A NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR DIRECT AID TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT THERE WAS NO STATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN LIMITED INFORMATION ON HOW FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED. IS THE EDITOR ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING INCLUDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS. AT I BUT THAT HARRIS FROM THE FINANCE THAT- AT THIS TIME THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY THINKS ABOUT ABOUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THAT- THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN I CAN TAKE BACK AND WE CAN GET THAT ARE ARE THE MAJOR VISION PAPA BUT AT THE TIME WITH OTHER THAN RELATED TO THE POINT. I IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE WITH OUR FUN. SO I WOULD. THE THANK YOU. I'M AND THEN. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE HERE. AT COLLEGES. OUR STUDENTS NOT ENROLLING BECAUSE- THEY'RE OR THEY'RE NOT RE ENROLLING WHERE'S THE LOSS OCCURRING FROM IS IT STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT RE ENROLLING OR NEW STUDENTS NOT ENROLLING. GOOD MORNING LIZ THAT NUMBER AT WITH BIG CALIFORNIA RECALL CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I'M HAPPY TO. BRIEFLY ADDRESS A WHAT WE KNOW AND OUR EARLY RECORDINGS SO WE ARE JUST NEEDING ANALYSES OF ENROLLMENT- FOR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY AND GETTING. UPDATES FROM OUR COLLEGES BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE COMBINATION OF STUDENTS ARE TAKING FEWER UNITS- TO ACCOMMODATE FOR COMPLEXITIES IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING- NEW STUDENTS NOT NECESSARILY AND ROLL AND OUR COLLEGES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK LOOK INTO TWENTY GONNA FIGHT WHO ARE THESE POPULATIONS WHAT REGIONS ARE THEY AND- WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO ENCOURAGE THEM. TO COME BACK TO OUR CAMPUSES- TO RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW WE OFFER A VERY PROGRAMS- THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THAT OUR IN PERSON AND- I SENT CITY PRO ARE SAFE SO ARE ALL AFTER THAT WILL CONTINUE IN COMING MONTHS. RIGHT YOU. SEVENTEEN YOUR QUESTION OKAY GO BACK TO FILARET AND OUR I'D LIKE. TO- REGARDING COMMENTS FOR MR I HAVE AGREE AND WITH THE COURSE WOULD BE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S. THE FOR COMEDIC IS ONE POINT 4% BECAUSE OF LIVING WHERE'S THE CATER TO IS. THREE EIGHT FOUR. EVERYBODY TO GET OUR STUDENTS BACK. AND THERE'S THE ISSUE OF THAT. SO TO A EXTENT TO THIS BUT- COAL PROMOTE EQUITY. AMONG OUR COULD CALL CASE TWELVE AND FOR YOUR DINNER. YOU WANT THAT FOR THE OF FINE FOR THE- DEPARTMENT FIND. FOR DO WE HAVE DANIEL HANOVER STILL THERE. MY APOLOGIES- FOR BEING OF YOU AND DOES NOTHING- SO THAT THEY YOU- YEAH THINK OVERALL FIRST OFF I'D SAY THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE TO COLA IS- ARE CALCULATED PREVENTIVE TRADITION USE- FOR THE BUDGET- BY IN GENERAL I THINK ARE THE MINISTER. FOCUSED THAT BY WAS REALLY. TO- THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS I THINK ALSO SEEN WITH SOMETHING THAT STATE ENROLLMENT DECLINE EVERYTHING. AT THE CLINIC ARE AS A RESULT OF THE NINETEEN AND THAT AND- WITHOUT DURING THE LAST THAT THOSE STUDENTS THAT. BUT DO NOT TEND TO BACK COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK WITH THE AS A BIG BOMB THREAT TO- THE BUDGET OF OUR COLLEGE SO. SAID THAT THE GOAL OF THE BUDGET FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUDGET PROVIDE FOR THE BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STATE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING TO KEEP AND ALL. POSE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. THERE STILL REMAINS THE ISSUE OF EQUITY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION TO. TO CONSIDER YEAH AND- IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. YEAH RIGHT I'LL JUST JUMP IN HERE I WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GO FIRST AND YOU PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED THE ISSUES I WAS GOING TO SAY AND- I'M I'M I'M NOT GONNA ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES QUESTION BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY JUST GIVE US A FRUSTRATING ANSWER I DON'T. WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD THIS MORNING. BUT I THINK IT'S NONSENSE THAT THE BUYING POWER FOR THE RIVERSIDE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE SAME FOR THE RIVERSIDE COMMUNICABLE DISTRICT. THE COST OF UTILITIES AND LABOR. AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SAME AND RIVERSIDE. SAN JOSE SACRAMENTO LONG BEACH AND THEN NORTH LA SO IT'S TO JUST TO HAVE THIS DIFFERENTIAL THING. IS JUST TOTALLY UNFAIR AND JUST KIND OF CLUELESS TO WHAT THE REALITY IS- OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES TO PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET. AND MAYBE OR JUST PENCILING THIS NUMBER I THERE TO EXPECT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE COULD AFFORD. BUT DID TO BUT TO SAY THAT IT'S THE FAIR FORMULA BASED UPON A CALCULATION. DOESN'T MEAN ANY SENSE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT HIGHER COLA FOR OTHER. INDIVIDUALS IN THE EDUCATION WORLD AS WELL- SO CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HELP WITH INCREASE REVENUES WITH THEM NAY REVISE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR SEEING HOW THE ECONOMY IS MOVING ALONG THAT IT. AT OF IMPRESSIVE CLIP SO. CERTAINLY THERE THAT COULD CHANGE WITH NEW RABBITS COMMAND AFTER THEY PULL TAX RECEIPTS AND GET THE MAY REVISE BUT SOMETHING THAT WE MADE WE MAY LOOK AT TO REGARDLESS AS FAR AS HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE. IN IN PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THAT'S SAYS THAT AN INEQUITY. AND THEN AND THEN TYING IT TO THESE OTHER PIECES FOR- ONLINE I'M NOT SURE THAT THE WISDOM OF THAT AS THE L. A. L. SAT IT JUST SEEMS THAT. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT DO IT BUT WHITE WHITE TIE IT TO SOME ARBITRARY OTHER PIECE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH DIFFERENTIATION. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AS AS THE L. A. L. NOTED SO. THAT THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS AND KIND OF DIRECTION THAT WILL HAVE- GOING FORWARD. AS FAR AS THE ENROLLMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS. A CONCERN FOR US AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S- REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE USUALLY. WHEN WE HAVE A RECESSION THROUGHOUT HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA THE COMMUNICABLE JUST MORE PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL RIGHT. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE ESPECIALLY. WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS BEING THE ONES WHO ARE HAMMERED THE MOST DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW LOW WAGE WORKERS WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR THOSE ARE THAT. WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY TO LOOK AT THE ACROSS THE NATION WHO IS BEING IMPACTED- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUALS WE WANT TO GET YOU KNOW GETTING MORE- EDUCATION INVOLVED OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO HAVE MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT. THERE'S OTHER NEEDS FOR THEM FINANCIAL AID DEALING WITH THEIR FAMILIES DEALING WITH THEIR OWN KIDS TRYING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CERTAINLY MONITOR- WE- JUST TRY TO STEP UP YESTERDAY WITH THE MID YEAR BUDGET ACTION. BUT WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST COLIN ROMAN THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS. IN AND ELEMENTS THAT HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THAT KIND OF A PRELUDE TO THE NEXT. ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS ALL THESE OTHER BASIC NEEDS TO THIS ISSUE WE WILL HOLD OPEN NO ACTION HERE- ON THIS ISSUE NUMBER ONE. FOR BASS FUNDING ENROLLMENT AND WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- PRESENT ON. ISSUE NUMBER TWO BASIC NEEDS PROPOSALS. THE COURT. I SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET BIRTH ND FOREMOST THAT STUDENT FOCUSED BUDGET. INSTRUCTION RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES FACED BY OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AS A RESULT OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND GIVING RECESSION. EIGHT CHALLENGES HAVE LED TO AN ESTIMATED 8% DECLINE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FROM PAUL TWENTY NINETEEN TO FALL TWENTY TWENTY. THIS BUDGET IS DESIGNED TO HELP ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME INTO THAT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS STUDENTS ABILITY TO AFFORD COLLEGE. THE TYPICALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS FOR STUDENTS. OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED MILLION WITH INCLUDING THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PACKAGE. ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS BUT AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS. ADDRESS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING FOOD AND HOUSING. AND THIRTY MILLION ONGOING FOR TARGETED BASIC STUDENTS ARE FOR TARGETED STUDENT BASIC NEEDS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND DIGITAL EQUITY WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU L. L. ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING FOOD HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH IS LAUDABLE BASIC NEEDS WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS HEARD ABOUT THIS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- THE PROBLEMS EVEN GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. TO DATE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS HAS BEEN RATHER PIECEMEAL. A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING AND LACK LACKING AN OVERARCHING GOALS AND STRATEGIES FOR WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. AND HOW TO DO IT ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THIS FOCUSES APPROACH HOUSE OF ELEMENTS WE THINK COULD BE IMPROVED UPON. FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW TO PROPOSE NEW PROGRAMS WOULD INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. APPLE AS WELL AS HOW THEY'D INTERACT WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO POTENTIALLY THE PROPOSAL COULD CREATE MORE SILOS. ARE ALSO. ANOTHER ELEMENT WE THINK COULD BE IMPROVED IMPROVED UPON IS THE GOVERNOR PROVIDE IT'S ONE TIME FUNDS FOR A PURPOSE FOOD PANTRY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IT REALLY REQUIRES SOME ONGOING FUNDING TO BE SUSTAINABLE. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH- THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH ALSO PROVIDES FUNDS WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATION OF LEVELS OF SERVICE OR DESIRED OUTCOMES. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH BY CREATING A BASIC NEEDS BLOCK GRANTS THE IDEA HERE WOULD BE TO USE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE PROPOSED MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY FOOD AND HOUSING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND INTEGRATE THAT MONEY WITH THE EXISTING ONGOING FUNDS FROM THE- RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM THAT THAT NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT'S PROVIDED ALONG WITH THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS MINIMUM SERVICE LEVELS AND DESIRED OUTCOMES. BUT THEN GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE COLLEGE DECIDE HOW TO STRUCTURE THEIR PROGRAMS HOW TO USE THE FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICTS COULD CHOOSE TO HIRE A BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR AT EACH CAMPUS AND ESTABLISH A ONE STOP HUB JUST AN EXAMPLE PROS THEY MIGHT WANT TO TAKE. WITH THIS MONEY AND THEN CREATE ALL OF THIS MONEY- IN THE WAY THEY SEE FIT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SHE COULD HAVE DISTRICTS REPORT REGULARLY ON SERVICE LEVELS SUCH AS APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN. THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM CALFRESH AND WHETHER STUDENTS TO ACCESS THESE STUDENTS STATE AND ROLLED. AND ENDED UP GRADUATING. STILL THE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID GRANTS WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU'VE NOTED ARCHER MCCARTY IS TAKEN AFTER EARLY ACTION ON PROVIDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO STUDENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR STUDENT AID WE WOULD NOTE THAT CONGRESS AND THE BY THE MINISTRATION ARE DISCUSSING A THIRD ROUND A FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS. FUNDING LARGER THAN THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS COMBINED WHICH WOULD INCLUDE MONEY FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS. SO WE'LL HAVE TO TRACK WHAT HAPPENS AT THE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT ASSUMING THIS THIRD ROUND IS APPROVED- WINTERS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TO CONSIDER USING THE PROPOSED HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT FUND FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE RE PURPOSED- BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL PAY DOWNS OR TO HELP WITH PENSION RELIEF. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ENGINE AFTER MANY OF OUR STUDENTS FINANCES ARE THE MAIN BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE FRAIL COOLEY ATTACHED TO EDUCATION THE NEW ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS pDAYCARE SHIFTING WORK SCHEDULE AND AN ANTICIPATED EXPENSES WERE THE LAST STRAW DESIGN POSTER CLEARER THAN EVER OUR STUDENTS DESPERATELY NEED. EMERGENCY GRANT ACCESS WE THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PUTTING STUDENT NEEDS ARE IN THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PACKAGE AND- INCLUDING IT IN THE BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE YOU MANY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED STUDENT POPULATION AND HIGHER AT NOW AS A RESULT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT INVESTMENT MERGING SEA GRANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS AND ENSURE THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS DOES NOT PUT. THEIR EDUCATIONAL DREAMS ON HOLD THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO KEY TO STABILIZING ENROLLMENTS HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY FINANCIAL AID OFFICES THAT HAVE SEEN REDUCTIONS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS INCLUDING A THREE POINT SIX MILLION A REDUCTION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE URGE A BALANCED APPROACH THAT SUPPORTS BOTH OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENABLES THE DELIVERY. OF THOSE SERVICES. AND AS WE FURTHER DEVELOP A HOLISTIC STUDENT CENTRIC APPROACH TO BASIC NEEDS WE LOOK FORWARD TO INTEGRATING HEALTH FRESH OUTRAGE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE BELIEVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN BETTER LEVERAGE AND FORTIFY PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTIES SO THATTHE RESOURCES ARE WIDELY UTILIZED AND EFFECTIVE. AS SUCH AND AS A RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE LEGISLATURE MAY CONSIDER MENTAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM POP PROP SIXTY THREE AS A WAY TO NOTONLY BUILD THE STATE'S EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH CREATES STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COLLEGES AND COUNTIES. LASTLY WE ASK THAT THE ASSEMBLY CONSIDER APPROACHES TO BASIC NEEDS BUT YOU ALSO LOOK AND PURSUED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS BY WAY OF CAL GRANT REFORM WHICH WE NOTE THAT CHAIRMAN CARTY IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA HAVE BEEN LONG CHAMPIONS AND ADVOCATES FOR. OF PROVIDING LONG TERM CAL GRANT REFORM WILL ENSURE THAT YOU COLLEGE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AS A TOP PRIORITY AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL GO INTO GREATER DEPTH ON THIS MATTER IN ISSUE FIVE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- I'LL START WITH A FEW QUESTIONS ON ON THESE ISSUES SO CERTAINLY THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS GARNERED INCREASED ATTENTION IN SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST FEW YEARS WE REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE CAMPUS THAT THE THAT THE FACULTY THAT TRADITIONAL. ELEMENTS AS FAR AS STUDENT SUCCESS THAT THAT REALLY MATTER IT'S ESPECIALLY WITH THE POPULATION WERE FACING I'S- ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES WITH FOOD INSECURITY AND- HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THAT HAVE SO MUCH IMPACT ON. STUDENT SUCCESS OF. THE FEW THINGS I WANT TO JUST KIND OF. TEASE OUT HERE. ONE WE DO KNOW THE COMMUNICATORS ARE VERY VERY DIVERSE MORE THAN A HUNDRED CAMPUSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA OF COURSE- ALL OF THESE CAMPUSES HAVE IT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE AT HAD SOME STUDENTS WHO FACE. THESE ISSUES AND- NEED SUPPORT FOR SOMEBODY'S. SOMEBODY'S AFTERWARDS SO. CAN EITHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE CHANCE WITH OFFICER BOTH IT MAY BE RESPOND TO WHAT THE L. A. I WAS TALKING ABOUT AN INCH INCH AS OPPOSED TO PICKING AND CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS WHETHER IT'S ON GOING OR ONE TIME AND- OF COURSE I THINK THESE BASIC THESE ARE OUR ONGOING ISSUES AND SO. IT'S HARD TO GET GOING WITH THESE EFFORTS WITH ONE TIME MONEY- IS THERE MERIT TO THIS IDEA OF THAT WE SHOULD THEY WE SHOULD HAVE THESE KIND OF MANY CATEGORICAL HERE BUT MORE BROAD BLOCK GRANT FOR THE CALL JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WANT TO SPEND THEIR MONEY. SO LET'S START WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON THAT OKAY. THANK YOU JIM MCCARTY- WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN THAT- AND AS CONSIDERED IN THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE SEEN GROWING ATTENTION AND GROWING NEEDS AROUND BASIC AND SECURITY OF FOOD HOUSING WE ALSO A SENIOR COLLEGES TAKE ON VERY INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS SO WE DO THINK THERE IS MERIT IN CONSIDERING HOW WE CREATE. AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE BELIEVE OUT HAS SOME CONSIDERATION AND- WE THINK OUR COLLEGES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR STUDENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM SUCH AN APPROACH SO DO YOU OR DON'T USE SUPPORT WITH THE L. A- RECOMMENDS INCREASING AS BLOCK GRANTS FOR THESE MONIES AND OTHER MONIES OR SHOULD WE HAVE THESE. MANY. CATEGORICAL THREE EACH OF THESE. ALL I THINK AS IN AND POLICY EFFORTS WOULD WANT TO SEE THE DETAILS ON HOW THIS IS CRAFTED BUT WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE CRAFT AN APPROACH THAT- IS COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE THAT INCLUDES. BOTH AN INTERSEX INVOLVES AN EXISTING- INVESTMENTS IN BASIC NEEDS BUT ALSO SOME OF THE NEW ONES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. ALSO I WOULD ADD- DATA ALIGNMENT- PARTICULARLY WITH COUNTIES AS WE EMBARK ON CALFRESH EFFORTS HAVING AND DATA SO THAT WE KNOW WHETHER OUTREACH IS HELPING US INCREASE CALFRESH ENROLLMENT THAT THINK THEY'RE MANY PROBLEMS. AND DETAILS THAT COULD BE WORKED OUT IN A VERY POWERFUL PROPOSAL. AT OKAY. WHAT DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE AN OPINION ON ON THE ILIO RECOMMENDATION FOR. MORE OF A BLOCK GRANT. FOR THESE. ALL THOSE AND OTHERS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FUNDED IN THE CAN YOU CALL JUST FOR BASIC NEEDS. FOR I I'D SAY THAN SIMILAR WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT TEN AND HOW BEST TO MEET THAT THE- BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS- AT AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION PARTY WAS REALLY TO ADDRESS THE- SPECIFIC BASIC NEEDS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT. PARTICULAR HEADING FOR STUDENTS SUCH AS YOU KNOW MEANT TO HOLD. ELECTED HE COULDN'T HOUSING- INTO RAPID ENGAGEMENT AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW BEST TO ADDRESS THOSE. YEAH IT'S- AND AS FAR AS A MENTAL HEALTH I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR PUTTING AT THE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET BUT LINKING THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY IT SEEMS KIND OF RANDOM THINGS ARE BOTH. IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTH OF THOSE. I WILL NOTE THAT AS FAR AS MENTAL HEALTH THERE IS MONEY OF COURSE HERE AND THERE IS ANOTHER EFFORT THAT. THAT THAT I'M WORKING ON AND OTHERS. TO LOOK AT THE PROP SIXTY THREE FIND AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE MILLIONAIRES TAX FOR. MENTAL HEALTH WHICH THAT FIND IT YOU KNOW IT'S CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS ARE DOING QUITE WELL CALIFORNIA MEANING YOUR DISTRICT RIGHT. THEY- THAT FUND IS JUST EXPLODING AND- WITH THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG PRIMARY THAT AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TESTIFY FOR THAT IN A FEW SECONDS. BUT THE ONE THING TOO I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT SOMEONE MEMBER BERMAN HAS AN IDEA ON THIS IS THAT THESE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS ARE SO KEY AYE AYE AYE COUPLE YEARS AGO I PUT MY IN THE BUDGET TO FIND ONE HERE AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE- KIND OF ANNOYED THAT I GIVE TO ENOUGH MONEY IN DOLLARS IT'S NOT DONE YET TWO YEARS LATER SO CHANCES OFFICE MAKE SURE. YOU CAN TALK TO OUR LOCAL SERRET LOS RIOS TO GET ON IT BUT THE ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT STUDENTS THERE'S NOT DATE SOMETIMES AS A MENU OF THINGS THEY HAVE CHALLENGES WITH STUFF THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RAPID RE HOUSING LEADING UP TO SIGN UP FOR CALFRESH OR HEALTH CARE OR OTHER ISSUES AND SO. HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S ONGOING OR AFP THAT'S IN A KEY ON THE CAMPUS. WHERE STUDENTS AN GO I THINK IS THE KEY YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WE SPENT AN HOUR TWO WEEKS AGO TALKING ABOUT CALPERS SO BY DEFINITION. MOST OF THE STUDENTS ARE VERY VERY LOW INCOME AND CALFRESH IS SUPPOSED TO BY DEFINITION. PROVIDE FOOD FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE BUT- IT'S HARD TO LINK THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER SO. HAVING THESE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS ON. CAMPUS IS A PLACE TO GO THAT ARE. ADEQUATELY STAFF THAT HAVE HOURS AVAILABLE OR- THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE YOU CAN CALL ENTERED YOU HAVE AN APP OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO. CAN STUDENTS CAN ENGAGE. I THINK IS A IS IT IS AN IDEA THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON BECAUSE- IT'S BRIDGING THIS FOR SERVICES IN THE STUDENTS WHICH IS THE KEY AND OTHERWISE IF YOU JUST HAVE THESE. ON OVER HERE OVER HERE AND HERE AND YOU DON'T CONNECT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO WORK- THOSE ARE MY KIND OF MY THOUGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT AS WE CLOSE OUT THIS YEAR'S THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO. QUESTIONS COMMENTS BY MEMBERS ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT. JUST WANT TO ABSOLUTELY WORTH MY DREAM IT WITH YOU ON THAT I THINK THAT THESE BASIC NEED BLOCK GRANTS. ARE ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD IDEA YEAH AND- PROVIDING THE- WHAT THE DISTRICTS NEED- TO MAKE THE DECISIONS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS- I LIKE THE IDEA OF YOUR BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND I HOPE THAT. THE FUNDING CAN BE PROVIDED ALSO FOR SAMPOERNA DINO VALLEY COLLEGE AND SOME OF OUR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES- I THINK THAT THE IDEA IS GREAT I THINK THAT WITH THE BASIC NEEDS. BLOCK GRANTS HAVING STATE OBJECTIVES AND REPORTING- ON THE OBJECTIVES WOULD BE IMPORTANT SO IN THE END WE GET TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. BUT WE ALLOW IT TO BE DONE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BECAUSE THEY WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO DETERMINE. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED I AGREE WITH YOU WITH THE CHAIR THAT PUTTING MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY AND ONE GROUP. JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT- HAVING A BLOCK GRANT I THINK IT'S JUST A GREAT IDEA. SEVEN REVISED THAT ESTIMATE TO MEDINA- I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT I THINK THAT THE BLOCK GRANT APPROACH IS- IS REALLY WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR DISTRICTS ARE HOME DISTRICTS AND GIVING THEM THE FLEXIBILITY JUST TO CLARIFY THOUGH SO BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ARE OPEN TO. THIS TYPE OF MODEL FUNDING. WAS THAT EVER I DON'T HAVE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- YET WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN SUCH A CONVERSATION AGAIN TO LOOK AT- IN AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO BASIC NEEDS. WE KNOW IT'S AN- ON. GOING EFFORT ON TO ADDRESS THIS IN THE HOUSE- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND LEARNED A LOT SO WE WANT TO. INCLUDE SOME OF THE EVIDENCE. AND PRACTICES THAT WE LEARN FROM FROM OUR CAMPUSES. AS THIS IS CRAFTED. DEPARTMENT AND TELL THEM THAT ARE THAT ARE. AND- YEAH I THINK WE'RE WE'RE IN THE SAME POSITION WHAT WERE WERE HAPPY NOW CONVERSATIONS THAT THAT THE THING THAT STRUCK FOR THE MIGRATION PROBLEM. GREAT AND- TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE CORONA VIRUS RESPONSE AND RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACTOR I GUESS SURSA- REQUIRES AT LEAST THE SAME AMOUNT OF STUDENT AID AS THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED UNDER THE CARES ACT SO. IS DOES THE COMMUNITY CALLED THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES PLAN TO USE ANY OF THE BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED AS A FLEXIBLE INSTITUTIONAL AID FOR ADDITIONAL STUDENT AID OR TO SUPPORT OTHER BASIC NEEDS. IT AT THE WHEN THEY IS THE SECOND SENSUALLY SECOND STIMULUS FOR COOPER TIRE RACK WAS PROVIDED ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DID WITHIN THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE IS ENCOURAGING COLLEGES TO SPEND MORE THAN THE MINIMUM ON EMERGENCY NEEDS SO AS YOU KNOW THE MINIMUM WAS AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN OUR COLLEGES ARE YOU KNOW SEEING THOSE RESOURCES COME TO- BE ACCESSIBLE TO HAPPEN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM NO DIRECT REPORTING WAS REQUIRED OF THIS FEDERAL BILLS SO WHEN WE SEEK OUT INFORMATION WE ARE DOING SO- DO SURVEYS TO HER CAMPUSES TO GET A SENSE OF NOT ONLY WHO THEY'RE SERVING BUT ALSO- HUMAN COURAGE THAT THEY ARE USING MORE THAN THE MINIMUM. I WILL ADD THAT ON THROUGH EFFORTS OVER THIS SPRING AND SUMMER WE'VE ALSO CLARIFIED THAT THESE DOLLARS CAN BE USED FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT ZACKS LOSER AREAS. THAT WE EMPHASIZED. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MR MEDINA THE GUY JUST ONE OF A AGREE WITH OUR WITH OUR CHAIR AND POINT OUT THAT THE IDEA OF A LOCAL BASIC NEEDS CENTERED ON EACH OF THE CAMPUSES ARE- COLLEGES MAKES SENSE AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WHAT WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF PANDEMIC WHEN PHILANTHROPIC GROUPS I GOT TOGETHER TO REACT TO THE EMERGENCY NEED OF STUDENTS THAT THAT MONEY WAS% GONE THAT MONEY WAS GONE FOR BASIC NEEDS WITHIN HOURS- AND LARGE SUM OF MONEY. A STATE WIDE AND- THE DEMAND FOR THAT AID WAS IMMEDIATE AND OVERWHELMING SO WANT TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF- BASIC NEEDS ON CENTERS ON CAMPUS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WE WILL HOLD THIS THIS ISSUE OPEN- GOING TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AGAIN AND OUR DEPARTMENT WITH THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DIMINISHING CONTINUES THAT COMMITMENT TO WORK BASED LEARNING AND HELPING STUDENTS ATTAIN. AIMED OR RETAIN EMPLOYMENT AFTER FINISHING THEIR PROGRAM. THIS COMMITMENT HAS BECOME EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE AND THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE FACT THAT EVERY SECTOR OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND ITS CONTRACTORS HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. THAT AND THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND WORK BASED LEARNING MODEL AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO AUGMENT THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY. THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU ALL ALL TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE PERSONAL WORK BASED FINANCING WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH EXPANDING FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE. LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF GRANT FUNDING THAT WENT OUT GRANT AWARDS BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DEMAND AMONG ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS FORTIES GRANT APPEARS TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO FOLLOW THE FULL FLIGHT EVEN THOUGH. CURRENT LEVEL OF BROWN'S OF FUNDING. SO THE CHANCES OFFICE IS PUTTING OUT THESE REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS TO THE FIELD AND AGAIN BASED ON THE RECENT ROUND DIDN'T. GET ENOUGH INTEREST AMONG ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO AWARD ALL THOSE MONEY SO GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT SEEN JUSTIFICATION FOR JUMPED DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM. A SECOND- CONCERN OF OURS IS THE LEGISLATURE STARTED FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. YET THE LEGISLATURE STILL LACKS DATA ON WHETHER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED WITH THESE PRIOR YEAR MONIES ARE BEING SUSTAINED. AFTER BIRTH AFTER THE GRANT FUNDING ENDS UP WE DO UNDERSTAND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A STUDY TO LOOK INTO THAT. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S AND REPURPOSE FOR HIGHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS I'D PUT TOWARD A LARGER- APPORTIONMENT AUGMENTATION OR PAY DOWN ORE DEFERRALS. AS REGARDS TO THE WORK BASED LEARNING- PROPOSAL THAT DEPARTMENT FINANCE JUST MENTIONED WE WOULD HELP THE WORK BASED LEARNING IS ALREADY A FOCUS OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. FOR ANNUALLY- ALSO WORKING LEARNING IS A COMPONENT OF THE STATE FUNDED GUIDED PATHWAYS INITIATIVE AS WELL AS REGULAR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OF THE LEGISLATURE FUNCTIONS WELL SO. WE'RE NOT. TELL US IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY A NEW SEPARATE INITIATIVE ON WORK BASED LEARNING IS NEEDED WE RECOMMEND- LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL REPURPOSE THE FUNDS FOR HIGHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS PAIN DOWN ADDITIONAL DEFERRALS THANK YOU. OKAY THE TRANSFERS ARE THIS. THE COMPANY CAN KNOCK ME COLLEGE SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW HAS PROVEN- TO BE ONE OF THE STATE'S FIGHT AGAINST COVER NINETEEN AS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF WORKFORCE TRAINING MOST EXPANSIVE HIGHER AND SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA OUR STUDENTS OUR SYSTEM PRESENTS ONE OF THE STATE'S PRIMARY PATH BACK TO PROSPERITY AND A CHANCE FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR ALL. THE GOVERNOR IS PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND AS YOU KNOW COMING COLLEGES STAND READY TO PUT CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK CAN ASK SUCH AN INVESTMENT IN WORKFORCE WE BELIEVE IT'S PRUDENT. NOTABLE APPROACH- AS THEIR WORK BASED LEARNING AND THOUGH THIS IS AN AREA THAT- IS USED WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE ECONOMIC NEEDS AND OUR NEEDS TO PUT INDIVIDUALS BACK TO WORK THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAT CAN BE EXPANDED WORK BASED LEARNING- AS YOU KNOW PROVIDES EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND THE CLASSROOM TO ACCELERATE ADVANCEMENT ALONG CAREER PATHWAYS. THE PURCHASE AGES INDIVIDUALS AT EIGHT WORK TO GAINES SKILLS IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELATED CLASSROOM AND LAB INSTRUCTION IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR NOT AN OCCUPATION AND OUR INDUSTRIES ARE CHANGING THESE PROGRAMS CAN PUT INDIVIDUALS READY TO WORK- I'LL ADD THAT A STUDY BY THE SOCIAL POLICY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES ANALYZING THE IMPLEMENTATION- AND SUCCESSES OF THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE. IS ANTICIPATED FOR MARCH OR APRIL OF THIS YEAR. WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTION ON THIS WORK OF FOR. YES WOMEN REALLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON APPRENTICESHIPS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IF WE ARE TRULY TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS KOVILAKAM COVERED RECESSION WE TRULY NEED THE WORK FORCE AND THE ABILITY TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION AND OF COURSE OUR HOUSING NEEDS THE VERY VERY DIRE NEED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SKILLED WORKFORCE I BUT I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT. MAKING SURE WERE APPROVED INVESTING IN WHAT DOES WORK FOR EXAMPLE IN EVEN IN MY DISTRICT IN SILICON VALLEY WE HAVE ONLY ONE CTE PROGRAM AT THE AT THE SECONDARY SCHOOL WHILE. BACK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. I MIX UP MY TERMINOLOGIES WITH BRITISH EDUCATION LATER. IN THE DAY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THAT IS AND THAT IS THE METRO ED AND THEY ARE FUNDED IN A WEIRD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEY LIKELY IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING THIS YEAR WILL NEVER COME BACK. AND THEY HAVE A STRONG TRACK PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF GETTING. KIDS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT BE LOST IN THEIR PATH DIFFICULT WHAT JOB OF DOING THE NEED AND GIVE THEM THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN. IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK LIKE THAT- SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE FINDING A CITY WHERE IT WORKS AND I DO THINK. LOOKING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE WE HAVE TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE I'D THINK OF MANY TIMES EVEN MY DISTRICT WHERE I TALK TO PEOPLE WHO. REGRET GOING TO OUR WONDERFUL UC SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY TOOK A WHOLE LIFETIME OF DEBT. JUST TO GET A JOB THEY ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE AND THEY DON'T LIKE. AND THEY FIND THAT PERHAPS WORKING WITH THEIR HANDS WORKING THIS DIFFERENT SKILL IS WHAT DAY. IS WITH A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SOMETHING THAT WE AS EMBERS HERE ABOUT TO WIN THE FOR WHEN PEOPLE NAVIGATE ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE NAVIGATE WHAT. JOB OPPORTUNITIES I WANT TO DO. SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT HOW IMPORTANT IS OBVIOUSLY TO INVEST INVESTING IN A WORK FORCE OF FUTURE AND DEVELOPMENT FOR IT. BUT ALSO BE WORKING ON ISSUES OR WORKING PROGRAMS THAT. ARE SMART INVESTMENTS FOR THE ONE TIME MONIES THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU. SOME REVISED THAT IS. CANYON MINISTRATION SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT THE TWO HUNDRED ANDFIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PLACE FULL A HOLDER FOR WORK FORCE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ARE THE DETAILS OF THE WORK FORCE PROPOSAL EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE THAT MAYBE VICE. I DON'T BACK DOWN FROM THE FINANCE AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF AN UNFORTUNATE IN TERMS OF TO THE TIMELINE FOR RELEASING MORE DETAILS REGARDING THAT PROPOSAL- BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ONE TWENTY THERE ARE DETAILS OF THE PUBLISHER. SO THE CIVIL RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT DETAILS WILL BE. PROVIDED BEFORE THE MAY MAY REVISE THAT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT THAT THAT THAT'S CORRECT AND HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TO THE EXPECTATION. OF ONE BUT THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THANK YOU I'M ALTHOUGH THOUGH THERE IS AN IT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMME SECTOR. THE MOVE MATERIALS PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T APPEAR TO REFLECT AND I. T. PRE. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- GIVEN THE GOAL OF INCREASING FEMALES AND OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- AS WELL SUPPORTING. APPRENTICESHIP IN HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRY SECTORS IT SEEMS THAT AND I. T. PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- SECTOR WOULD MAKE SENSE CAN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONTRACTORS OFFICE. AND CONFIRM WHETHER THERE IS A I. T. PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SECTOR AND IF SO HOW RE REACHING OUT TO SOME OF OUR- GLOBAL POPULATIONS. ARE WOMEN AND UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS- IN WRITING TO YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I SAID THAT- I CAN CONFIRM WHERE WE HAVE SUCH PROGRAMS. AND OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE OPPOSE TRADITIONAL- POPULATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN BARKED IN THESE INDUSTRIES- ESPECIALLY AS YOU MENTIONED ARE WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR SO. WE DID IT AGAIN PROVIDE SOMETHING IN WRITING- SHORTLY AFTER THIS HEARING. THANK YOU. OKAY FURTHER QUEST OF THIS ITEM SEEING NONE. WE WILL HOLD THIS THIS ISSUE- OPEN. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THIS IS KIND OF A HODGEPODGE OF OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY ONE TWENTY BUDGET AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL PRESENTS. THANK YOU THE YEAH BEFORE THE FOURTH AT A MALL GO OVER SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSED SO THINK THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT I'VE NOT ALREADY PASSED- THESE ADDITIONAL BUTTON SHOULD HELP COLLEGES TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. EVEN AFTER THEIR MARCH THE PANDEMIC. FIRST ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO PRIMARILY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION I COMMUNITY COLLEGES. DEPEND IF IT HAS BEEN A CLEAR THAT ONLINE EDUCATION IS POSSIBLE. ADMINISTRATION AUDITED ONLINE EDUCATION AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF INCREASING ACCESS TO THE COLLEGES. PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. THE POINT SIX BILLION SUPPORT THE CONTINUITY OF EDUCATION AND QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING INCLUDING ACCESS TO ONLINE TUTORING ONLINE COUNSELING AND ALL NIGHT DIDN'T SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE THERE IS A VEHICLE IDENTIFIED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS THEY LEARN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTMENT IS PROVIDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOW BECAUSE THE NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ONLINE STUDENTS. THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY OF INSTRUCTION MATERIALS. THAT HELP REDUCE THE COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR STATE. THE PROPOSALS ARE FIFTEEN MILLION AND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WHICH IS PROPOSED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR ATTACKS ACOSTA GREASE. WHICH IS NOT PROVIDED- FUNDING IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT- INTENT BUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. IS PROPOSED FOR INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FOR TWO ONE MOMENT STOOD. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY THAT LEVERAGES MODERN TECHNOLOGY. EIGHT MILLION TWO- EIGHT MILLION ONGOING TO ADDRESS ADMINISTRATIVE COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION FOR EDUCATION NETWORK INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA- BETTER IN THE SCENIC. AND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS EIGHTY FOURTEEN SIXTY. THAT'S THAT THE WHITE ANTI RACISM INITIATIVE. FIVE THIS BUDGET PROVIDE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AT SEVERAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE MANDATE BLOCK GRANTS THE TABLE STUDENTS PROGRAM PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. OUR STUDENTS SERVICES EXTENDED OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES CAMPUS CHILD CARE TAX BAILOUT AND APPRENTICESHIP. WE'VE GOT THE LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TOTAL ROUGHLY SIX POINT ONE BILLION AND ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND- WITHOUT A THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE. THANK YOU CABALLERO. WHERE IS YOUR FOR INCLUDES SEVEN PROPOSALS FOR THE SECOND TIME WELL THIS TYPE ON THE FIRST TWO THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INTRODUCED THE TEN POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING FOR ONLINE TOOLS AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR ZERO TEXTBOOK COST DEGREE GRANTS. WITH REGARDING WITH REGARD TO PROVIDING AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION FROM ONLINE TOOLS WE WOULD NOTE THAT INCREASE COSTA COLLEGES ARE THE RESULT OF THE COLLEGES MOVING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR INSTRUCTION ONLINE SINCE THE PANDEMIC SO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW LONG. ONLINE USAGE RATES WILL REMAIN AT THESE ELEVATED LEVELS AT THE SAME TIME COLLEGES HAVE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THEY CAN USE TO COVER THESE EXTRA BURDEN. OF SLATED TO MORE ONLINE USAGE MORE USE OF THE ONLINE TOOLS AND AS I MENTIONED IN ISSUES SHOULD APPROVAL IT'S POSSIBLE THE COLLEGES WILL HAVE EVEN MORE FEDERAL RELIEF. FUNDS IF THE GOVERNMENT APPROVES A THIRD ROUND. OF FEDERAL MONEY SO GIVEN THAT OUT YOUR COSTS FOR ALL. ALL RIGHT TIME BETTER WILL BE FINE REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR COLLEGES TO COVER EXTRAORDINARY COSTS RELATED TO MOVING SO MUCH OF THEIR- SERVICES ONLINE. IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO PROVIDE AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION SO WE WOULD RECKON RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND CONSIDER RE PURPOSING THE MONEY FOR OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS AUGMENTED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OR PAYING DOWN MORE DEFERRALS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR ONLINE TOOLS NEXT YEAR. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT USAGE LEVELS ARE AT THE COLLEGES AND WHAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE GOING FORWARD. WITH REGARD TO ZERO TEXTBOOK COST OF THAT PROPOSAL. WE WOULD NOTE THAT COURSE TEXTBOOK COSTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT SO CREATING ZERO TEXTBOOK COST DEGREES CAN HAVE REAL BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE STILL AWAITING AREPORT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON THE RESULTS IN THE IMPACT OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN STATE FUNDED ZERO TEXT TEXT BOOK COSTED SHOULD'VE. THAT WAS SOMETHING LEGISLATURE FUNDED AND SO INFORMATION FROM THAT REPORT COULD INFORM THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO FIND A NEW ROUND. OF GRANTS FORTY ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AND THAT REPORT ALSO COULD BE USEFUL IN HELPING THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS CRAFT A NEW ROUND OF PROPOSALS THAT THE NEW ROUND OF GRANTS THAT. KIND OF LEARNS FROM- THE LESSONS OF THE FIRST ROUND SO WE WOULD WITHHOLD RECOMMENDED WE RECOMMEND- THE LEGISLATURE HOLD OFF FOR NOW- TAKING ACTION WE RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ALRIGHT ADDITION PENDING RECEIPT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORT IT'S A CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE INDICATES. IS COMING SOON THANK YOU. OKAY QUESTIONS PRESS. DUMPS MEETS CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SEVERAL OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT SUPPORTER COMPREHENSIVE MISSION SO I'LL PROVIDE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON SEVERAL OF THOSE FIRST HELP PRETTY CAN BE CALLED IS THAT AS YOU KNOW ATTEND CAMPUSES ACROSS A VERY DIVERSE SYSTEM IN 73% OF OUR STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS ARE BOTH SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY ARE VITAL TO ENSURING THAT STUDENTS CAN IDENTIFY WITH FACULTY AND STAFF. AND HELP THEM SUCCEED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS REQUESTED THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OFFICE ESTABLISH A FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE PRESENTED INSTEAD OF A STATE WIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON STRUCTURAL CHANGES INCLUDING POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND TOOLS THAT WILL SUPPORT DIVERSITY INITIATIVES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. RELATED TO ONLINE EDUCATION AND CULTURAL CONTENT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ALIGNS WITH THESE GOALS AND RECOGNIZES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THESE PRACTICES IN THE CURRENT LEARNING MODALITIES FOR OFFERING IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN INVESTMENT IN ADVANCING OUR DIVERSITY. EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS. THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSE IN IN IN ONLINE RESOURCES IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE SWIFT TRANSITION TO DISTANCE AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAD TO PURCHASE AN INCREASE USAGE OF SEVERAL LEARNING PLATFORMS ON BEHALF OF COLLEGES. THIS FAST ACTING APPROACH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO TRANSITION EIGHT TWO POINT ONE MILLION SYSTEM. AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES COMPLETELY ONLINE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS THE- THESE WERE UNEXPECTED COSTS THAT CANNOT EASILY BE ABSORBED INTO EXISTING COLLEGE. COLLEGE BUDGETS ALREADY STRAINED. AS PLANS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE DEVELOPED WE ANTICIPATE THAT A 100% FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION IS LIKELY IS UNLIKELY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AROUND INOCULATION RATES AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS FACULTY OR STATE. COLLEGES INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HYBRID OPTIONS TO USE A BLEND OF TECHNOLOGY AND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. SENT TO SUSTAIN SUCH INSTRUCTIONS COLLEGE WILL NEED A ROBUST ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLATFORMS INCLUDING TUTORING TOOLS TECH SUPPORT EIGHTY EIGHT EXTRA STABILITY RESOURCES. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL SUPPORT DISTANCE EDUCATION ACCESS TO STUDENTS WILL ALSO FOUND WITH MODALITY ENDING TO THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TEN POINT SIX MILLION INVESTMENT IN ONLINE ECOSYSTEM. I BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP US SERVE EVERY PART OF THE STATE. ALSO ALSO RESPONDS TO A BUDGET REQUEST THAT WAS CRAFTED IN CONSULTATION WITH MANY OF OUR SYSTEM STATE QUARTERS. ALL ADD THAT BY PURCHASING THESE PLATFORMS AS A SYSTEM COMMUNITY COLLEGES LEVER LEVERAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND OBTAIN SERVICES AT A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE COSTS AND FURTHER STATEWIDE APPROACH. PREVENTS INCONSISTENCY ACROSS OUR DISTRICTS AND AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT FURTHERS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SO AGAIN WE ASK YOU TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS OP PROPOSAL. TO THE ISSUE OF ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREED. AS HE NOTICED ACOSTA HAS ARE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE BECOME AN AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF ZERO TEXTBOOK COST WAYS EACH WILL BE RELEASED IN MARCH INDICATES THAT STUDENTS SAVED AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TRANSITIONING FROM OUR DEPENDENCY ON TEXTBOOKS TO MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. NOTICE HOW WE ARE CONSERVE PORT THE AFFORDED OF. THAT IS A INTEREST TO THIS. ALSO OUT. IN THIS BUDGET. WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE DEVELOP AND BUILD. BUILDING ON OUR PRIOR ONLY OUR INVESTMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN BE A PRUDENT AFFORDABILITY EFFORT. AND FINALLY I WANT TO THANK- THE ASSEMBLY IN PARTICULAR SOME REMEMBER MCCARTY FIRST PARTNERSHIP AS WE ELEVATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED IN. INDIVIDUALS I GATHER THE GENIUS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF IS THAT WE PROVIDE SECOND CHANCES ARE EFFORTS THROUGH THE RISING SCHOLARS PROGRAM WILL LINE TO OUR STUDENTS IN ACHIEVEMENT AGENDA AND ALLOW US TO SERVE THIS IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA POPULATION. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WHENEVER REST MORE OF A COMMENT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS SOME OF THE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WHEN WE HAVE GREAT NEEDS AND GREAT PROGRAMS ALREADY I LIKE THE MOTOR AND MASSA AND POINTED- THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING USED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL ESPECIALLY IN HELPING OUR STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED AND I THINK THAT INVESTING MORE IN THOSE PROGRAMS IS A MORE SOUND INVESTMENT THAN. SOME OF WHAT IS BEING OFFERED HERE SO MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN YES. YES COMMENTED WILL RECEIVE DIE I WOULD NOTE TO I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE WAS OFFICE TALKING ABOUT. THE RISING SCHOLARS- EFFORTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND LAST YEAR AS WE REMEMBER WE HELP FIND AT CSU PROJECT REBOUND WHICH IS QUITE SUCCESSFUL HELPING FORMERLY INCARCERATED SO AS CALIFORNIA. TAKES A LOOK AT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND WE'VE LOWERED SIGNIFICANTLY ARE INCARCERATION COUNTS IT'S UPON US TO HELP THE STUDENTS SUCCEED WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO SOCIETY. YOU THINK- THE THAT THE EASIEST PLACE TO GO ON HIGHER EDUCATION WOULD BE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MORE THAN UC AND- CSU NOTHING WRONG WITH UC AND CSU BUT JUST BARRIERS OF ENTRY SO. IT'S KIND OF IRONIC THAT THIS THAT WE'VE STEPPED UP AND FUNDED PROGRAMS AT THE CSU. AND UC BUT NOT AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. SUPPORT FOR- IT DISMISSIVE BECAUSE THEY KNOW CABS ARE YOU DO IT WITH THESE RISING SCHOLARS- PROGRAMS. AND I WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS MERIT TO- ZERO THAT TEXTBOOK COST PROGRAMS AND AS A STAFF REPORT NOTES WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN THIS REPORT COMING OUT- I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FOR FURTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THESE ITEMS I DON'T SEE ANY WHICH I HAD TO MOVE THE AGENDA ALONG- ISSUE NUMBER THE WHOLE THIS ISSUE UP IN ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. INSTITUTIONAL AID CAL GRANT REFORM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THAT ARE STILL EIGHT COMMISSION HEARING COUPLE WEEKS AGO. AND THE COMMUNICATIVE CERTAINLY HAVE A BIG PIECE OF THIS AND SO. WE HAVE THIS AGENDA AS TODAY AS WELL. MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS I'M DAVID O'BRIEN VICE CHANCELLOR FOR GOVERNOR RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE DIRE NEED FOR FINANCIAL AID PERFORMED BETTER SIR CALIFORNIA. ALL STUDENTS IN CRISIS THE BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY THAT YOU'RE PARTS SO MUCH ABOUT- ALREADY AND IT IS OUR ONLY GROWN WITH THE COMPANY NINETEEN AND EVERITT AND RECESSION. STOPPAGE PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW WITH MAJOR STATE EIGHT PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY SERVE OUR STUDENTS SO- I WON'T GO THROUGH THOSE IN DETAIL FOR YOU WILL NOTICE YOU SKIN THAT AGENDA THE MAJORITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. ADDRESS IN ROMAN FEET OF THE RIGHT NUMBERS TUITION OR TALK ABOUT TUITION AT THE MOMENT. NEW CALL SYSTEM IN FACT ABOUT HALF OF OUR STUDENTS. BROCKLEY BY YEAR DON'T PAY TUITION TO ATTEND A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT OF LEADERS SUCH AS YOURSELF. WE SERVE OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CALLED PROMISE GRANT% THE WAIVER FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ARE BOUGHT THE WAY FOR. MANY OF OUR COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS ALSO UTILIZE FUNDING FROM CALIFORNIA ALL ON THIS PROGRAM. CREATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AND CHAMPIONED BY THE STATE ASSEMBLY TO WAIVE FEES FOR ALL FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. HOWEVER AS THE COMING RECENTLY APPARENT IN RECENT YEARS THE LARGEST COST OUR STUDENTS FACE TO ATTEND COLLEGE PARTICULARLY IN HIGH COST STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA IS NOT TUITION BUT OTHER MORTGAGE WORK. SUCH AS TEXTBOOKS TRANSPORTATION MEDICAL COSTS. AND HOUSING NONE OF THESE ARE OPTIONAL STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE OF DEFERRING THEIR RENTS NOT MAKING CAR PAYMENTS OR CHOOSING NOT TO FEED THEIR FAMILY JUST BECAUSE ARTS AND INVOLVES. ACTUALLY I SHOULDN'T I'M NOT SOMEONE UNFORTUNATELY MANY PERSONS DO MAKE SOME OF THOSE TOUGH CHOICES AROUND FOOD AND HOUSING. AND. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. HE WHY CHAO. MORE THAN JUNIOR JEWS CALLS. MEET AN OLD. THAT THING AIDES NUMBER THAN EVER. IS THAT OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS NOT SURFACED COVER. NON JEWISH AND- WHICH HOLBROOKE OF THE- AS THE HEAD OUT THE PREPARED A PROVIDE YOU BROWN'S. YOU CHOW GRANT AWARD. WHICH PROVIDES LOW STILL TO THE SMALL STATE BEGINS THE OPS IS NOT WITH US. HAS LOST SEVEN FIVE PER OF ITS VALUE. YEARS CURRENTLY PROVIDES JUST OVER EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SEMESTER LOCAL TIME STUDENT OR ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. FOR STUDENTS TO REDUCE THEIR WORK HOURS OR AVOID GOING TO PREVENT THAT SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON STUDIES. THE OTHER INEQUITIES BUILT INTO THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAM IS THE QUESTION AROUND WAS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE STATE STUDENT AID TO BEGIN WITH. THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE AS AN ENTITLEMENT TO STUDENTS WHO ATTEND COLLEGE IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFITS STUDENTS ATTEND FOR YOUR- CITIES. AND IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECEIVE HER STUDENTS TO START THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION LATER IN LIFE. STUDENTS WILL BEGIN COLLEGE MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THEY GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. OR WHO TRANSFER FROM A COMMUNITY CULTURE FOR UNIVERSITY AFTER THEY TURNED EACH TWENTY EIGHT. ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT BUT INSTEAD WIND UP IN THIS LOTTERY LIKE SYSTEM WHERE THERE ARE JUST FORTY ONE THOUSAND AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE HELP AND WORDS. SERVING OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE STUDENT FINANCIAL NEED. THESE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WOULD RUN MANY WORKING PARENTS AND ADULT LEARNERS. SO WE DO PPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE PROGRAM MODERNIZATION. THE PROPOSAL THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIGNITY COMMISSION IS PROPOSING. AND THE LEGISLATION THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTY MEDINA ARE CARRYING AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. OUT A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS THE IMPACT FORCES MARC STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE. MORE TIME TO VALUATE THE OVERFLOW. BUT I AM TO PROVIDE A FEW I LOVE REACT. YOU LIMIT. THE LIMIT O THE ARBOR RASH THAT. THAT COULD NOT L. G. TO SOME PARTS IS PROMISED. TELL GRANT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SHOULD NOT BE A- AS A EXT TO STUDENTS OF RECENTLY RIGHT HIGH SCHOOL OR BELOW AGE. WE ALL KNOW THAT- A STUDENTS WHO START THE HIGHER A LITTLE LATER IN LIFE- WE USED TO USE THIS TERM NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS TO DESCRIBE ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING THE NORM HIGHER EDUCATION. SO ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL AID TO SUPPORT THAT SO WE STRONG SUPPORT THIS PROVISION OF THE PROPOSAL. WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THE DIRE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE STATE IS PROBABLY FACING A REALISTIC ABOUT YOU FUNDING INVESTMENTS WE CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS NEED MORE STUDENT AID TO ATTENDANCE EXCEEDING OUR- AWARD THAT LOST THREE QUARTERS OF ITS VALUE AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO- IT CURRENTLY PROVIDES ON AVERAGE IF YOU. COPIED BY MONTHS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH SHOULD BE INCREASED NOT REDUCED SO WE'RE OF COURSE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND OUR STUDENTS. ON LOOKING A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF NEW REVENUE IS NEEDED INVESTMENTS WE WOULD NOT THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND US SOURCES OF SPECIFIC FUNDING OR SPECIAL FUNDS. NEED TO BE APPROACH VERY CAREFULLY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE N THESE DISCUSS SOONER RATHER THAN. SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE BEST WAYS TO SUPPORTING. MARCHED BUT I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY WE WANT AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CRISIS OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY BASIC NEEDS. FACING OUR TWO MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN WORK ON TOGETHER AND OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY STERN MEDINA I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE SAID- IN MY THIRTEEN YEARS AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE I SAW THAT THE BIGGEST REASON WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DIDN'T FINISH- FINISH AT ALL OR FINISH SOONER WAS BECAUSE LIFE GOT IN THE WAY. ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT IS THAT THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE THE NEED TO WORK. WHICH IS NOT. REAL CONDUCIVE TO FINISHING COLLEGE- AND SO I THINK THAT THE CAL GRANT REFORM THAT WE'RE DOING- IS WAY OVERDUE. HAPPY TO BE DOING THAT WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND- WAS HAPPY TO INTRODUCE FINANCIAL AID AWARENESS MONTH ON THE FLOOR. THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS YES AND ALSO CENTER LEYVA AS OUR OUR JOINT AUTHORS AND AS WELL ON THAT SO. BOTH HOUSES ARE ENGAGED WITH THIS YEAH I JUST WANT TO NOTE ON THIS- AS AS YOU SAID WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE FINANCIAL AID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S INTERESTING YOU LOOK AT STUDENTS. AT UC BERKELEY AND UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN BERKELEY AND THE FINANCIAL AID THE BERKELEY STUDENTS GET IS WAY MORE THAN THAT THEN THE LOW INCOME COMMUNICANTS DURING THE LOOK AT HOW THE CAL GRANT THE PELL GRANT. INSTITUTIONAL IS LAYERED ON THE ODDS OF SUCCESS ARE SO MUCH GREATER THAT FOR THE UC STUDENT MESSIEST AND THE COMMUNICATION WE KNOW MANY TIMES NEEDS. MORE SUPPORT AND THAT SO MANY OF THEM HAE OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND FAMILY AND SO FORTH AND SO- WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTEE BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE DOING VERY WELL I MEAN MISTER O'DONNELL IS THE PRODUCT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I AM OUR SPEAKER IS AND SO MANY OTHER MEMBERS ARE I'M NOT SURE WHO. WHO ALSO APPEARED- SO WE KNOW THAT THEY DO- HELP STUDENTS NAVIGATE BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE BASED ECONOMY WE NEED TO DO. MUCH MORE WE KNOW THAT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIND IT- LEGALIZING SPORTS GAMING IN CALIFORNIA HAS AN IDEA OF A ON GOING PERMANENT. REVENUE SOURCE OF THATEVER GOES TO THE BALLOT IN I'M NOT SURE THE VIABILITY OF THAT I'M CERTAINLY WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING GENERAL FUND BUT I KNOW THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT WOULD THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- DAVID. AND I AND I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE BECAUSE YOU USED TO WORK FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION NOW YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNICABLE JUST OF THE COMMUNICABLE JUST PAY YOUR- BILLS RIGHT NOW BUT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. CAME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT WE COULD- RE ALLOCATE SOME RESOURCES WITH DAN- OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE CREATED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH HAS NICK SUCCESS NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT. PROGRAM- MARC. COMPLETION GRANTS YEAH WITH THE- THE COMPLETION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WE HAD DUELING PROPOSALS- I THINK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE FORMER PART TIME DALY ON ONCE WE MERGE THAT- AND THERE IS AN IDEA TO USE SOME OF THAT TO START SOME OF THIS EFFORT TO FIND. THE CAL GRANT TO AND WANTED THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO RESPOND- ON THAT IDEA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR THAT IS- YOUR CORRECT THAT- BERMAN TO WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY THOUSAND CHANCES LOVES NOW NOT THE- STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AS IT RELATES TO- REDIRECTING FUNDS FOR MANY OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS WERE OF COURSE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND DO. ANY ANALYSIS NECESSARY ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE WE'RE HERE FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE ARE HERE TO GET OUR STUDENTS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO- NOT JUST THE TEN BUT TO THRIVE. IN THE CALIFORNIA. SYSTEM AND BEYOND OUT WHATEVER COMES NEXT WHETHER IT'S AN WORKFORCE OR TRANSFERRING SOMEWHERE OF COURSE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS- I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW INTERNALLY WILL WANT TO DO SOME ANALYSIS ON THAT. AND THEN OF COURSE WE'LL ONE OF THE- CAREFUL ABOUT YOU KNOW MAKING SURE WE DISCUSSED THAT PROPERLY INTO. THROUGH OUR STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THAT IS A PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY FOX NINETY EIGHT. WHICH IS OF COURSE VERY COMPLEX. BUT CREATE THE QUESTION MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT- THE BALLOT OR OR OTHER SOURCES- AND ULTIMATELY WHAT HOPE. THAT WE CAN- AS YOU ALLUDED TO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS. NEW INVESTMENTS. BEYOND JUST THE SORT OF THE- RESOURCES ARE IN CAN OFFICE STOCK NOT NECESSARILY SAID WE WANT TO LOOK AT UP PROGRAMS THAT. STUDENTS AND IN OTHERS. BECAUSE WE WANT YOU KNOW YOU SEE AND USED JUST. OF COURSE AS WELL SO- REALLY- WE WERE AT- THE- OVERALL OF FUN. IN STATE AID HIM BECAUSE- IT IS WILDLY AND I BELIEVE ALLOW SORT BACK NOTHING THE- ALL WAS THAT. THERE ARE RISKS. DOLLARS CAL GRANT GOING TO ALL OTHER SEGMENTS COMBINED FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR THAT GOES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT AT RECTIFYING THAT AND THAT WOULD BE LONG TERM BUT YES WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ANALYSIS. OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING I'M INCLUDING THE STUDENT SUCCESS WE SHOULD WRAP PROVIDED- IT YOU KNOW IT IT NEEDS. PROGRAM GOALS AND IS THAT A PROPERLY. RESPECTFUL GOOD THAT'S A AT. ANSWER BE OF WE'D LIKE TO WELL ONE WE BY TO START THIS. PROCESS AS THE LEAD TO. OUTLINES ITS IT'S- IT'S ROBUST AND IT'S VERY ASPIRATIONAL STAR WE WANT TO GO WE SPENT AN HOUR IF YOU. ARE MORE TALK ABOUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BUT BUT THAT STARTING IT WITH WHAT WE HAVE WE THINK IS WOULD BE A WIN AS WELL SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DO THAT WITH. SYSTEM RESOURCES AND MAYBE PUT A LITTLE BIT- IT IN IN THE GENERAL FUND IF WE CAN TWIST APARTMENT FINANCES ARM ON THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT- WE'D LIKE TO DO. AS WELL- FURTHER QUESTION SOMEONE MEMBER RACE THANK YOU MR WELL I TO IN THE PRODUCT OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION FROM STAMINA DINO VALLEY COLLEGE SO I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THE VALUE OF THIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION ON IN PEOPLE'S LIVES- I THINK THAT IT'S BEEN. IT'S CLEAR FROM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE THE LARGEST POPULATION OF STUDENTS YET RECEIVED THE LOWERS CAL GRANT AWARD AMOUNTS I AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE AND WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS TO FIX INEQUITIES AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS AT THE YOU SEE THE CAL STATE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSIONED WORKGROUP WORKGROUP OF FOR STUDYING THIS ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES SO THAT OUR STUDENTS GET THE FINANCIAL HELP THEY NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE FINISH COLLEGE AND SUCCEED. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS COMMENTS THIS IS AN ISSUE WE WILL BE WORKING ON AND POTENTIALLY COME BACK- WITH THE PROPOSAL LATER IN THE SPRING ISSUE NUMBER SIX LAST ISSUE BEFORE I GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THIS IS CALIBRATED COLLEGE- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S INFORMATIONAL OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY- THIS IS AS WE ARE AS WE WELL NOW THIS IS BEEN AN INTERESTING AND- HIGHLY DEBATED AND- HONESTLY VERY CONTROVERSIAL- PROPOSAL AND PROGRAM. THAT THAT DID WAS IMPLEMENT THE LAST FEW YEARS- REALLY AT THE URGING OF THE PRIOR GOVERNOR PAT BROWN- WE HAVE AN AUDIT COMING OUT IN THE IN A FEW WEEKS. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNDERLYING- ISSUES AND QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND- WE HAVE WITH US TODAY. THE THAT CALIBRATE COLLEGE WITH THE CHANCE TO PRESENT TO US AN UPDATE ON OUR CONTINUED STATE FUNDING SUPPORT- LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID I REDUCE ONGOING SUPPORT BY FIVE MILLION AND FORTY NINE MILLION REDUCE FROM THERE ONE TIME- HOLDOVER MONEY FROM THE YEAR BEFORE WE DID ATTEMPT TO ZERO THIS THIS PROGRAM OUT. I STILL QUESTION WHETHER IT'S- IT'S USEFUL FOR CALIFORNIANS SWEET YOU HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED RIGHT NOW- I KNOW THEY LOOK TO EXPAND BUT- LOTS OF PROMISES LOTS OF UNFULFILLED PROMISES- GALLAGHER HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT SURE- WHICH ONE HAS MORE PROMISES IN WEST DELIVERABLES TO DATE- THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR- YEAH I WILL NOTE TO THAT AS WE'RE SEEING RIGHT HERE WITH COVERED NINETEEN. THERE'S MORE AND MORE ONLINE EDUCATION ANYWAY SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION DO WE HAVE THESE COMPETING EFFORTS I KNOW THAT BY JUST LOOKING TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT OF ONLINE PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR THEIR HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED OR SO. ON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE- BUT WITH THAT- ALL STOP AND ALLOW THE THAT CALIBRATE COLLEGE- PRESENTER. TO JOIN US HERE THIS MORNING. HERE A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEANETTE HOW LOCKER MEN AND- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU AT TODAY. AND FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE MISSION OF CALVET COLLEGE TO INCREASE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO OBTAIN DOGS. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I AM A LIFELONG ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WITH MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN THIS MISSION. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES APPOINTED ME AS THE PERMANENT CEO OF CALVET COLLEGE LAST JULY. AND I RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE CREATED UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP. WE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE HAVE RESPONDED BY MAKING SEVERAL NECESSARY CHANGES. MADE SUBSTANTIVE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE WITH STRENGTH THAT STRENGTHENED CALPERS RELATIONSHIP THE SYSTEM CONSTITUENTS. ARE TAKING CONCRETE STEPS SUPPORT THE NEW FACULTY OF CALIBRATE. I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS AN EXCITING MOMENT FOR HELP RIGHT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF FINALIZING OUR THREE YEAR STRATEGIC VISION IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND WITH INPUT FROM STATE STATEWIDE STAKEHOLDERS WE ALSO WELCOME THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ARTIFICIAL FACULTY UNION. AND WE'RE LAUNCHING NEW PATHWAYS TO CONNECT OUR LEARNERS TO GROWING INDUSTRIES. HOW FIRST BEGAN SERVING STUDENTS. MONTHS AGO JUST FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC ATTENDED BOTH EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE BUT EVEN BEFORE THIS FOR THE EIGHT MILLION ADULTS WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE FOR EFFECTIVELY STRANDED WITHOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY. FOR OPPORTUNITY FROM ABILITY. MEANWHILE IT'S RICHARD PREDICTING A CRISIS FOR EMPLOYERS TO FACE A MILLION UNFILLED JOBS IN FAST GROWING INDUSTRIES BECAUSE WORKERS LACKS THE NECESSARY SKILLS. THEN COVERT NINETEEN TURNOUT CRISIS INTO CATASTROPHE. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY MOST LIKELY TO BE STRUGGLING WITH THE CHANGING ECONOMY HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF THIS TOPIC. AND THESE ARE WORKING MOTHERS WITH CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE PEOPLE THAT CALIFORNIA WAS BUILT TO SERVE. INTERMISSION IS ONLY GROWN MORE URGENT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR ADULT LEARNERS ARE ALSO TEMPTING TARGETS FOR PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. ADDRESSING THIS WITH A KEY FOCUS OF MY WORK IN THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AFTER LOSING THEIR JOB DURING THE LAST RECESSION. ARE AN AVERAGE FINANCIALLY WORSE OFF TODAY THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY HADN'T ATTENDED COLLEGE AT ALL. A DECADE FROM NOW WE DON'T WANNA BE FACING THAT SAME REALITY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TODAY TO BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE RECOVERY. SO CALIBRATE WE LOOKED AT COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT BY THE CAMP PANDEMIC AND KEPT A LASER FOCUS ON THEIR NEEDS. I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE ARE MAKING STEADY AND CONSISTENT PROGRESS IN SUPPORT OF OUR MISSION. OUR STUDENTS BUT THE STATE'S TREMENDOUS RACIAL DIVERSITY AND MORE THAN 90% ARE ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IN SHORT OR SURFING EXACTLY THE POPULATION. THE LEGISLATURE SOUGHT TO SERVE BUT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH OURSELVES TO MEET THE STUDENTS WERE WHERE THEY ARE. WE'VE DONE ANALYSIS OF THE LABOR MARKET NEEDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE STATEWIDE INSTITUTION WERE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO REGIONS OF THE STATE WHERE NEED IS THE GREATEST INCLUDING PLACES LIKE INLAND EMPIRE AND CENTRAL VALLEY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE PROGRAMS UNDERWAY AND IN APRIL WE LAUNCHED A SERIES TO HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION INTO NEW TECHNOLOGY CAREERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE. LOOKING AHEAD TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE ARE ONTRACK FOR FULL ACCREDITED. AHEAD OF. THE KEY MILE. AT ALL SET US UP FOR BOTH FASTER. AND LONG TERM SYSTEM. BONTA NETWORKING AND I SAW. WE AYE DE. UP TO SELL SHARES. THAT ARE FACING ADULT LEARNERS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS INCLUDES SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY NEEDS THAT RURAL SISTER COLLEGES WE DID AT THE START OF THE CONTENT. ADDRESSING EQUITY ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM WIDE ENROLLMENT APPLICATION. SHARING ARE GROWING EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. AND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COLLEGES LIKE COMPTON COLLEGE BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE IN MORE. DURING MY CAREER IN EDUCATION I'VE SEEN WHAT'S WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS MOMENT REQUIRES A NEW APPROACH. WE STILL CALVET SITS AT THE NEXUS BETWEEN LABOR MARKET AND HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH GIVES US THE ABILITY TO BUILD PROGRAMS THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO AND PREDICTIVE OF EMPLOYER NEEDS. WE'VE GONE EVEN DEEPER TO INTERVIEW WORKERS IN KEY ROLES AND TO CONNECT THE DOTS TO DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS REAL CHALLENGES PEOPLE FACE AN EMPLOYMENT MARKET. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO US TO BE STICKING FIRST AS AN INSTITUTION KEEPING OUR POPULATION AND THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVERYTHING WE DO. OUR FACULTY PRESIDENT SENATE PRESIDENT MICHAEL STEWART ACTUALLY SHARE STORY WITH ME THAT I KEEP TOP OF MIND. MONICA IS A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE IS BORNAND RAISED IN SACRAMENTO SHE HAS THE PASSION TO FIX THINGS BUT NO ACTUAL BACKGROUND IN TECHNOLOGY J. TRUCKIN ONLINE FOR PROFIT PROGRAM BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS. TODAY MONICA THAN OUR I. T. PROGRAM PURSUING MORE STABLE FUTURE FOR HER FAMILY. SHE SAID I QUOTE I THINK THIS OFFERING IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO COME TO CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON A CALIBRATE FEATURE. NOT CALVET FUTURE FOR MONICA IS OUR NORTH STAR WE ARE AND WE ARE READY TO SUPPORT HER AND LEARNERS LIKE HER ON THEIR JOURNEY. I THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS UPDATE. AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU. OKAY START WITH MR MEDINA. THANK YOU- I THANK OUR CHAIR- IN THE INTRODUCTION HIT THE NAIL- ON THE HEAD WITH WITH HIS REMARKS I'M I'M SOMEWHAT. ACTUALLY AMAZED THAT WE'RE STILL HERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION- YOU'RE LOOKING HERE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT- CREATED THIS PROGRAM IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN MONTHS IN OPERATION. AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN. SO LITTLE DONE WITH SO MUCH. I CANNOT BELIEVE. THAT WHAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME HERE THAT THE COLLEGE HAS ISSUED THIRTY FIVE CREDENTIALS TO TWENTY NINE INDIVIDUALS. IN SEVENTEEN MONTHS AND THAT IS AT AN INVESTMENT. OF I'M NOT SURE. WHETHER IT'S THE SIXTY MILLION ONE TIME IN A FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING. BUT IF AND I'M NOT A MATH TEACHER SO I'M NOT SURE WITH THAT PENCILS OUT TO DOLLAR PER STUDENT YEAH I THINK IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IF YOU LOOK AT THE ONE TIME AND IN MULTI YEAR IS NOT GOING PER STUDENT YEAH. AGAIN I'VE NEVER SEEN SO LITTLE DONE WITH SO MUCH YEAH WE COULD WRITE THEM OF ALL THE CHECK AND CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND- WHEN WE WERE. FIRST BROUGHT THIS IDEA HERE. TO THE ASSEMBLY- OF THAT THE AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD. THE SKEPTICISM THAT WE HAD WAS TREMENDOUS. AND I COMING FROM EDUCATION SAID WELL I'M NOT SURE THIS IS REALLY GOING TO WORK HOW ARE YOU WE GONNA YOU KNOW TEACH THESE STUDENTS- DISTANCE LEARNING. THESE SKILLS THAT YOU PROMISE THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE. BUT WE WERE WE WERE TOLD NO DON'T WORRY YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THE STUDENTS ARE THERE THE DEMAND IS THERE WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THE UNIONS SEIU RIGHT THERE ARE THESE. LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WHO ARE NOT BEING- THEIR EDUCATIONAL. NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET ANYWHERE- THE STUDENTS ARE THERE HIGH DEMAND. FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR STUDENTS ENROLLED. THIRTY FIVE CREDENTIALS TO TWENTY NINE INDIVIDUALS. WITH A HUGE INVESTMENT AND THEN. YOU KNOW AND I AND I AM SAYING ALL THIS THIS MAN AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU YOU YOU ARE NEW HERE YOU'RE THE NEW CEO BUT- OUR AS- OUR CHAIR AS COMPARED THIS. TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE ARE HOLDING THE BAG FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD I SAID AS MUCH ON THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY. AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR I SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE- NO THE FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAMME LAST YEAR I SAID ON THE FLOOR THE ASSEMBLY AT THE END OF SESSION- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ALWAYS LISTEN TO. AND WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION AS SOMETIMES THINK THE PRACTITIONERS OF EDUCATION MENO MORE SOMETIMES THAN THE POLICY MAKERS. OF RESPECTFULLY. WE WERE VERY SKEPTICAL. HI I HAVE ASKED FOR A- ADDED THE AUDIT IS COMING I. PURPOSELY ASKED THAT THE IDEA NOT HAPPEN UNTIL WE KNEW WHAT WAS THE BUDGET SITUATION FOR CALIBRATE BECAUSE THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT CAB RIGHT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY FUNDING AND THEREFORE THERE WITH THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AN ODD. I WILL SHARE WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW- HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO DEFINE CAL BRIGHT- IN IN IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IT IT'S A BILL THAT WILL PROBABLY COME THE HIGHER ED COMMITTEE. IT WILL BE A BILL THAT I WILL SUPPORT I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE STILL ASKING FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PER STUDENT OUTREACH. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR BUILDING. IT HASN'T WORKED. WE WERE SKEPTICAL AT THE BEGINNING IT HASN'T WORKED- THE MANY CAN CERTAINLY BET BE PUT TO BETTER USE I AM SOMEWHAT- EMBARRASSED- MISS MEN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COME HERE TO DEFEND THE PROGRAM THAT HAS WORKED. THANK YOU. THE OKAY THANK YOU MISTER LEE. I THANK YOU EXACT DIRECTOR FOR JOINING US AND AS MY COLLEAGUE ALLUDED TO YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM IS WAS CONCEIVED BEFORE YOU CAME ON SO IT YOU ARE IN THE UNENVIABLE POSITION TO DEFEND UPON IT NO I WILL FOR THE SAKE OF MY BELOVED HIGH SPEED RAIL I WILL TO DEFEND IT BECAUSE HIGH SPEED RAIL AT LEAST IS FILLING A VOID A UNIQUE NEED THAT DOES NOT EXIST CURRENTLY. WOULD GIVE YOU THAT NOW THEY ARE THERE BUT THE ONLINE EDUCATION AS WE HAVE ALL DISCOVER UNIVERSALLY HAN BE DONE BY OTHER NEED OR CAN BE FILLED BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN WHEN I WAS A STAFFER I REMEMBERED THE COR ARGUMENT BEING. WHY IS THIS SOMETHING THAT ARE CAN YOU COLLEGES COULD NOT OFFER ON THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW. WELL WE GOT THE ANSWER NOW DURING THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY IT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN OFFER ON THEIR OWN. AND THEY ARE DOING IT AND I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE EFFECTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S WHY FRANKLY A LOT OF OUR- COMMUNITY RETURN TO THE SCHOOLS WHEN THEY NEED EDUCATION AND I DO FIRMLY BELIEVE. THERE IS A PLACE FOR REMOTE DISTANCE LEARNING OR ONLINE EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED IN THEIR LIVES I THINK THERE IS THAT NEED. BUT I AM ALSO SKEPTICAL THAT WE NEED TO INVEST THE- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. INTO REPLICATING SOMETHING THAT WE NOW ARE DEMONSTRATING TO EXIST IN REAL LIFE- SO THAT'S WHY I. REMAIN VERY SKEPTICAL OF IT AS WELL. I AND I DO BELIEVE STILL THAT. AS OUR EDUCATORS AND OUR CHECKING ME COLLEGES HAD BEEN EXPRESSING TO US SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT AND THEY ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT YOU CAN DO IT- BUT MY QUESTION. RIGHT NOW TO EXACT DIRECTOR IS GIVEN ALL WE KNOW ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING NOW. AND THAT ALL THE COMING COLLEGES HAVE THIS. A POTENTIAL TO DO REMOTE DISTANCE LEARNING. ACTUALLY FUNNY ENOUGH USUALLY IN OUR HEARINGS I ASK THE- EDUCATION SEGMENTS WHEN ARE YOU RETURNING TO IN PERSON I GUESS IN THIS CASE THERE WILL. BE NO QUESTION OF THAT SORT. BUT MY QUESTION WOULD BE YOU KNOW GIVEN ALL WE KNOW ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING NOW AND THE REAL REALITY. THAT ALL COMING COLLEGES CAN OFFER. THESE PROGRAMS AND YOU ALLUDED TO WORKING WITH OTHER COLLEGES AND PARTNERSHIPS. WHAT UNIQUE NEED. LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL. CAN CALIBRATE FILL IN THIS TIME OF MODERN EDUCATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LATE AT IT IT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION AT CALVET HAS THAT DISTINCTIVE MISSION BECAUSE IT'S BUILT. FOR THE CHALLENGES. NOT WORKING LEARNERS ARE FACING TODAY AND IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT MODEL FROM WHAT WE SEE AND CONVENTIONAL ONLINE EDUCATION THAT IS GREAT WORK THAT MANY OF OUR SYSTEM COLLEGES ARE DOING- IN PARTICULAR AT HI I JUST WANT TO SAY I DON'T CONSIDER OUR COLLEGE TO BE SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE SYSTEM. I CONSIDER US TO BE A PART OF- THAT. GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ALL STRIVING TO DO THIS WORK- TO SERVICE POPULATION OF LEARNERS BETTER BUT WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR RESEARCH AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM PAST RECESSIONARY PERIODS. AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER IS WE HAVE TO FIND NEW WAYS OF DOING IT EVEN AN ONLINE NOT JUST ABOUT ONLINE FOR THESE LEARNERS IT IS ALSO ABOUT NOT HAVING A TURN BASED PROGRAM THAT IS ON AN ACADEMIC CALENDAR. ONE THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND SELF PACED AS OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN ONE THAT IS ABOUT GETTING THEM NOT JUST THE TECHNICAL SKILLS BUT THE CONTEXTUAL SKILLS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORKPLACE. MOST OF WHAT WE DO IN CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S DELIVERED ONLINE OR WHETHER IT'S DELIVERED IN AN IN PERSON SETTING IS HANNAH HUSBAND OVER TIME TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF A VERY TRADITIONAL AGE POPULATION AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO HERE. IS TO INTRODUCE A BEST IN CLASS VERSION OF COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOVE TO SEE EXPANDED IN THE SYSTEM AND I KNOW IT'S A SHARED SYSTEM GOAL THAT WE HAVE- BUT CREATING THE SPACE FOR THAT ARE AND HE WORKED TO OCCUR. IN WAYS THAT ALSO BENEFIT REAL LEARNERS BUT ALSO THEN CONNECTS TO- TO CONNECT TO THIS BROADER WORK THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IN MY SYSTEM COLLEAGUES ARE DOING IS IMPORTANT. I JUST ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES IN THE SYSTEM AND I AND I KNOW THAT WERE IN THIS WORK TOGETHER THEY SIMILARLY SEE THAT THREAT COMING FROM THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE PROVIDERS. WE ARE OPERATING IN A VACUUM THIS IS THE EXACT POPULATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEING TARGETED. WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR- FLEXIBLE OPTIONS OPTIONS THAT SELF PAY ACTION THAT CAN. THIS AND THE ON PRESIDENT PRESSURE AND DEMAND. THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE PROJECT. WHEN WITH CARE GETTING WORSE. ARE FOR. SO ME IT'S NOT OR THE A YES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING THIS WORK AS ENVISIONED. THE STATUTE IN THAT COLLABORATIVE PLAY IS A CORE PART OF HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THAT AND I'D LOVE FIFTY ONE CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF. OF THIS THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM WIDE APPLICATION. WE MIGHT THINK THAT ACTUALLY THE SYSTEM WIDE APPLICATION HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO. WITH WHAT HAPPENS IS ON THE ENROLLMENT SIDE WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE FOUND WAS BECAUSE WE WERE UNIQUELY COLLECTING DATA ON OUR LEARNERS THAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THAT IT HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND ADULTS STUDENTS. WILL BE THEN SUGGESTED KEY CHANGES THAT CAN BENEFIT THE SYSTEM WIDE APPLICATION FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES OF LEARNERS. AND THOSE KINDS OF CHANGES ARE ONES THAT BENEFIT PAIN POINTS THAT THE SYSTEM SEES AS A WHOLE. AND WITH EVERY THINK ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT ALL OF US TO REBOUND ARE ENROLLMENTS AGAINST THIS COMPETING. PRESSURE FROM FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. THAT WE ACT MORE AND MORE EMPHASIS. AND WE WORK TO IN A WAY THAT IT. WHAT EACH OF US IS DOING FIRST FOR WHAT EACH OF US IS DOING. BUT THAT'S SOME OF THE PROBLEMS NOT A SINGLE INSTITUTION CAN SOLVE ON THEIR OWN. BUT I THINK THAT ON. THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE IS THAT. THERE IS GREAT. PROMISE HERE. BUT IT'S JUST NOT BEING. MATERIALIZED IN AND YOU WOULD THINK DURING. THE PANDEMIC WHEN. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS IS. IS THE GREATEST THERE'D BE A BIG SUCCESS THAT'S NOT AND- YOU KNOW WHEN THIS WAS CREATED AND I KNOWS BEFORE YOUR YOUR YOUR TIME THERE WAS PROMISE THAT- SEIU AND- THEIR MEMBERS HAVE GREAT INTEREST IN. CAN CODING IN THE CAREER LADDER AND THAT JUST FIZZLED OUT AND- JUST THE PROMISED THESE PIECES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND I CAN CURRENT I DON'T WANT TO JUST MAKE THIS UNCOMFORTABLE AND UGLY BUT THE TRUTH IS IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND I KNOW YOUR NEW- IN THIS POSITION AND SO YOU KNOW I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND- AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- BUT TO KNOW THAT YOU TAKE YOU THANKED US FOR THE SUPPORT AND I'LL BE HONEST THERE IS NO SUPPORT THERE IS ONE. LAWMAKER WHO SUPPORTED THIS AND THAT LAWMAKER DIDN'T MAKE THIS SURVIVE. IT WAS THE GOVERNOR AND THE PRIOR GOVERNOR WHO FOREVER REASONS. HAVE THE SHINY OBJECT IN THE CORNER THINK THIS IS GONNA MATERIALIZE BUT IT'S NOT SO THERE IS NINETY. 8% DISAPPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS SO. YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE I KNOW THAT THERE'S AN AUDIT COMING OUT. I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE STANDING BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE ARE WHAT THEY WERE- I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU JUST A FEW A FEW. QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIVE FIND REALLY INTRIGUING IS THAT- CAL BRAT CALIBRATE PLANS TO SPEND. UP TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH PLACE BASED AGENCIES SUCH AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIBRARIES. JOB CENTERS- TO HELP FACILITATE IN PERSON SUPPORT OF CALIBRATE STUDENTS THAT DOESN'T THIS NEGATE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF CAL THE CALIBRATE YOU KNOW. WHAT'S THE POINT OF CALIBRATE. OF THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THINK THAT UNDERMINES THE WHOLE EFFORT. I THINK WHEN THE STATUE WAS FIRST CREATED IT ENVISIONED OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS TO OCCUR AT THAT WERE BASED IN COMMUNITY AND- THAT IS NOT ABOUT US SETTING UP STOCK IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE BUT IT'S REALLY AROUND. AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE TECHNOLOGY AND I AND OUR WORK PRESENTS AN IMPORTANT CONNECTOR TO THIS INSTITUTION AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ACTUALLY THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN COMPTON COLLEGE RIGHT NOW. SO COMPTON COLLEGES LEADERSHIP. RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS A CHALLENGE THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WITH IN PERSON SERVICES PRADA DEALT BASIC EDUCATION AND ADULT BASIC RULES AND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT INTO COLLEGE GOING INVOLVEMENTS AND THEY SAW AND SEE. A ROLE FOR CALIBRATE IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN ADDRESSING THE LEARNER NEEDS IN THE WAY WE DO WHICH IS NOT JUST THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST MODELED BY OUR FACULTY WORK ACROSS SILOS VERY TYPICAL OF AN INSTITUTION TO PROTECT PRESENT THE INTEGRATED SUPPORT MODEL. FOR SERVICES AND IN SUPPORT OF THAT ARE WRAPPED AROUND A STUDENT ABOUT TO BRING THAT TO CONTENT AS A WAY OF HELPING. COMPTON'S EFFORTS TO MATRICULATE STUDENTS FROM ADULT. INTO THAT INTO COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THE POPULATION WERE TALKING OUT ABOUT AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU MAY NOT SELF IDENTIFY WITH AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY MANY OF THEM IN THE- OUTRAGE IN THE FOCUS GROUP WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. EXPERIENCE IN EDUCATIONAL TRAUMA THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN. IN NEED OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN WHO CAN PROGRAM TO ADD TO SUPPORTING THEM TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THE TALENT THE POTENTIAL WHAT THEY BRING INTO- INTO POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION IN IN IN A WAY THAT RELATES TO THEM AND SO. WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM TO INTRODUCE CALVET LEARNERS INTO FUTURE PROGRAMS AT COMPTON COLLEGE AS WELL. YEAH AND I DO KNOW THE GOAL OF THIS AS AS MY COLLEAGUE MR LEE SAID THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE. EDUCATION IN THIS NON ALL BASED ECONOMY. THE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR MEN YEARS OUR YOU KNOW THE SCAM INSTITUTE. OF THESE YOU KNOW FLY BY NOW CALLED WHICH- REP. THANKS AND SO WE GET THAT WE JUST ONE DON'T WANT DISAPPOINT THEM AGAIN NOR THE TAXPAYERS WITH WITH WITH THAT I DON DONGLE OF AN EFFORT HERE. AND SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT THAT'S FRUSTRATING FOR US AS YOU KNOW. PRIOR WE LEARNED THAT THAT MOST OF THE CALIBRATE STUDENTS WERE STOCKED IN THE ORIENTATION CLASS THESE STENCILS CLASS. AND NOW YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED OR SO STUDENTS. HOW MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED THE ORIENTATION. AND ARE MOVING THROUGH THE REST OF THEIR PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE. MY TEAM FOLLOW UP WITH SOME OF THE SPECIFICS WE'VE ACTUALLY- FADE OUT THE ESSENTIALS PROGRAM AND WE HELPED MIGRATE THE STUDENTS FROM ESSENTIALS. INTO INTO THEIR SKILLS COURSEWORK AND SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZED WITH EXACTLY WHAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS THE CHALLENGE THAT STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING. IN THAT INTRODUCTORY COURSE THAT THE SEQUENCING OF THAT COURSE IS THE DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM DIDN'T WORK SO IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN A MATTER OF MONTHS NOT A TWO YEAR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BUT A SHORTER. CLAPPED OUT WE WERE ABLE TO NOT JUST IDENTIFY THAT CONCERN BUT MAKE THE CHANGES. ORDER TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING BOTH THE SOFT AN ESSENTIAL SKILLS THAT THEY NEEDED BUT THAT IT WOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH THEIR SKILLS AT WORK THAT THEY WERE DOING AND SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE. ALSO IN PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD- IS NOT AN ESSENTIALS COURSE BUT- OF COURSE THAT. IN BEDS AND CONSIDERS ALL OF THE TYPES OF CONCEPTUAL SKILLS THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORKPLACE IN ADDITION TO. THAT AN INTEGRATED WITH THE WAY THEY'RE APPROACHING SKILLS WORK THAT'S WHAT'S PRESENCE IN OUR TRADITION TECHNOLOGY SERIES SUPPORT JUST. SO MOVE ON TO IT IF THE STUDENTS DO FINISH. AND THE IS TO. A LINK TO A- THAT THE LACK OF AGREEMENTS EMPLOY. IS A IS A BIT CONCERNING I KNOW THAT CAL BRIGHT HAS. FORTY FOUR EMPLOYEES ONLY FIVE FULL TIME FACULTY SO VERY TOP HEAVY WITH ADMINISTRATOR SO. I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS LINK UP EMPLOYERS AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S WORKING. AND THAT WE DON'T AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION HAT THAT SAYS THAT IT IS WITH WITH WITH EMPLOYERS. IN ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS SO. SO WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS COLLEGE AND WHAT'S THE VALUE FOR YOUR STUDENTS IF WE DON'T HAVE JOBS WAITING FOR THEM. YES MY PREDECESSOR DID A LUNCH THE COLLEGE WITH- AN ASSUMPTION THAT- WE WOULD WORK TO GET INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS TO. ADD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COLLEGE AFTER REPLACEMENT PERSPECTIVE. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WITHIN FIVE MONTHS AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT AT CITY SCENARIO IN WHICH EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES BUSINESSES THEMSELVES ARE MAKING DIFFERENT DECISIONS ABOUT HIRING. OUR STRATEGY HAS HAD TO EVOLVE WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED EMPLOYMENT MARKET- THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN AND SO WHILE WE HAVE WE ARE ENGAGING. WITH WITH EMPLOYERS SPECIFIC THEY WERE PARTNERING WITH AN EMPLOYER ON THE LAUNCH OF THIS NEW PROGRAM THAT WE ARE DOING TO TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS INTO TECHNOLOGY CAREERS. WERE ALSO ENGAGING A BROADER SET OF INPUTS FROM EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY FROM TECHNOLOGISTS AND ALSO FROM THE LABOR MARKET DATA ITSELF THAT ENSURES THAT THE SKILLS ARE GETTING THE SKILLS THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING ARE VALIDATED AND PREPARING THEM FOR THE WORKFORCE SO. WHEN WE WORKED WITH OUR EMPLOYER PARTNERS IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT ON THIS NEW PROGRAM PATHWAY AND THE TRANSITION'S TECHNOLOGY PASSED AWAY- WE SOME OF OUR STUDENTS FROM THAT WILL TRACK INTO AN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY OTHERS WILL CONTINUE ON TO EARN A CERTIFICATION. THAT WE KNOW IS IN DEMAND WITH THE LABOR MARKET THE REALLY NEEDING TO INVOLVE OUR STRATEGY. BECAUSE WE ARE DESIGNED TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE ATTITUDE TO WHAT CHANGES WE'RE SEEING IN THE LABOR MARKET AND IT IS A TOUGH LABOR MARKET. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. CAN YOU GO BACK TO IT TO RE YOU'RE AT THIS YEAR FOR YOU TARA FIRST. RAW RETENTION RATES AND COMPLETION RATES. SURE SO AS YOU KNOW WE ARE AT THERE'S A SEVEN YEAR TIMELINE FOR START UP FOR THE COLLEGE THAT WAS ENVISIONED WE'VE MET ALL THOSE DEADLINES AND ARE HEADING YOU KNOW I'M TRACK AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND KEY MILESTONES LIKE ACCREDITATION- ALL OF THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PLANS FOR GROWTH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW. OF FINALIZING WITH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES A HREE YEAR STRATEGIC VISION THAT'S DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THE COLLEGE BUT ALSO SETTING A COURSE FOR HIGH QUALITY GROWTH. AND THROUGH THAT PLAN WE WILL TAKE US FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND ALL THIS THAT WE SEE THIS YEAR TWO FIVE THOUSAND ENROLLMENTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD NUMBER TRACKING AN ESTIMATED COMPLETION DURING THAT PERIOD- AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED. STUDENTS AND- DEPENDING UPON. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE LATE LABOR MARKET- YOU KNOW THAT. AT EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES WELL WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK AS WELL- WE THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT RELATIVE TO. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE KNOW IS OUT THERE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE LIMITED BENCHMARKING DATA AT THAT CAN GIVE US A SENSE OF- WHAT IT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO KIND OF STEP UP AND SCALE IN A WAY THAT'S HIGH QUALITY IN A WAY THAT'S NOT JUST CHASING ENROLLMENTS BUT THAT'S FOCUSED. ON OUTCOMES AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT WHAT WE NEED TO HONOR IT'S NOT JUST OUR EXPECTATIONS AROUND COMPLETIONS BUT IN IN TERMS OF. BEING CLOSELY ATTUNED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR LEARNERS THEMSELVES THAT WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT OUR MODEL IS THAT IT'S NOT SPENT THE STATE IN A TERM WITH THE SEMESTER- IF YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS WHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF A SICK CHILD OR YOU HAVE TO. CARE FOR A IN EARLY FAMILY MEMBER OR YOU YOURSELF GET SICK THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT FLEXIBILITY AT ALLOW SOMEBODY TO MOVE IT THEIR SELF HE'S FAT AND I AND OUR GOAL IS AND OUR JOB IS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING THEM- TO FIND GOAL THAT WE HELP THEM. AND THEN LAW I SOME OF THEM MEMBERS MASSIVE TO ASK I'M JUST LOOKING FOR CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT. THIS WILL BE A SUCCESS FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS AND AT CREDIBLE. REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE- BECAUSE- TO US SO FAR IT'S IT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS A REAL VALUE. WITH COMPLETION RATES AND JOB PLACEMENT RATES. AND THE TARGET HERE LOW WAGE WORKERS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND CONCERNED THAT IF IT IF WE FAIL THEN THEY'LL JUST WORSENED. OUR OUR RACIAL INEQUITIES IN INCOME ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CALIBRATES HAVING THAT IS UNACCREDITED AND HAVING A HARD TIME CONVINCING STUDENTS TO ENROLL. SO AGAIN. WHERE IS THE CONCRETE EVIDENCE. THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO SUCCESS FOR PARTICIPANTS. YES WE HAVE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL OF TRANSLATING THE LEARNINGS THAT WE HAD FROM THE EARLY PROGRAM PATHWAYS INTO THE INTO THE POSITIVE CHANGES THAT WILL CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR OUR STUDENTS OUT WE ARE ALSO AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF A CONVICTION HAVING SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. YOU KNOW AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOCUSED ON QUALITY ASSURANCE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WHAT INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING THERE I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY ACCREDITATION IS A PROCESS THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IN TERMS OF SUBMITTING OUR APPLICATION AND MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS TO GET ACCREDITED- AS WELL AS- WELL CONCURRENT PROCESS BY WHICH WE WILL. SEEK APPROVAL FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID PROGRAMS WHICH ARE REALLY ALSO UNLOCK RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO CAN USE THAT SUPPORT AND THAT RELIEF TO REALLY ENGAGE IN THIS OPPORTUNITY- SO I THINK THERE IS A LOT THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WERE IN AGAIN GOING BACK TO THAT SEVEN YEAR TIME WINDOW. BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I'M SATISFIED TODAY WITH THE PROGRESS THAT WE MADE I'M THE KIND OF PERSON WHO GETS THE FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR SO I HATE THAT I ABSOLUTELY- SEE THE INTENSE VALUE OF SCALING THIS UP IN A HIGH QUALITY WAY AND TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY AS GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT THE SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND. THAT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD HIGH QUALITY THINGS AND THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH THE WORK HAS A LASTING IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AT SCALE AND SO WE DON'T I I'VE TAKEN ALL THE LESSONS THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM WEARING MY REGULATORY HAT THAT THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE INDUSTRY AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING HERE. IS AGAIN IN THE BILL REFINING AND FOCUSING ON WHAT WORKS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO SERVE WHAT FLEXIBILITY AS WE NEED FOR SERVICES WE DO WE DO THAT AT A MUCH FASTER CLIP THAN CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION DOES AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MORE WE LEARN THE MORE WE SHARE OUT WITH OUR SISTER INSTITUTIONS THE MORE WE COLLABORATE THE MORE WE ARRIVE AT THE SHARED SOLUTIONS AND THE IMPACT. OF WHAT WE HAVE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ALWAYS IN OUR INSTANT. BUT IT IS ABOUT THE FOR. AND KATHLEEN. WE CAN THIS OF COMMUTER COLLEGES AND ASSIST. TO BETTER SERVE THE SAKE. I YOU KNOW I FORWARD TO DAY WHERE I CAN. TO SET BEFORE YOU AND- AND CONTINUE TO SHOW. OUR I KNOW THAT. MY STAFF IS LISTENING IN. AND THERE SOME SIMILAR FACES THE STAFF NOW I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE JENNIFER. JEFF BELL AND JENNIFER JOHNSON. WHO HAS. NOW COMMITMENT GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE UP TO DATE ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING. AND ALSO TO SHARE ENGAGE WITH YOU. ON THE ON THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING FORWARD. GOING FORWARD AND TO THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS ALSO IN TUNE WITH YOUR NEEDS AND- TO INCLUDE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S ALL FOR ME RIGHT NOW. SOME I THINK LISTENING THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS REMINDS ME THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE NOT GETTING THE FUNDING THEY DESERVE. THEY ARE RESPECTED AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR THE GREAT WORK THEY'RE DOING OUR COMMUNITY. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK IN THE ANSWERS- OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WHAT MAKES YOU SO UNIQUE. EVERYTHING THAT I HEARD. WAS SOMETHING THAT IS OFFERED IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES EVERYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR THAT MAKES CAL BRIGHT UNIQUE. WHAT WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THIS IS WHAT THE WHOLE ARGUMENT IS ABOUT EVERY BUDGET HEARING AND GET WITH OUR LIMITED RESOURCES WE'RE TAKING THAT MONEY THAT COULD BE ADDED ON TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING ALL THESE CLASSES ONLINE. THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IS DUPLICATIVE. THE MORE WE GIVE TO. CALIBRATE THE LAST FUNDING THERE IS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IN TURN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS I WOULD LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE AND I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE COMMENT HE MADE. ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID IS THAT WE'RE LISTENING FOR WE'RE NOT GIVING THE FULL VALUE TO OUR PRACTITIONERS AS WE SHOULD COMPARE TO OUR POLICYMAKERS WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS A PRACTITIONER AND IS A POLICY MAKER NOT ONLY WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM. FROM RIVERSIDE BUT ALL OTHER COLLEAGUES. THERE ARE PRACTITIONERS AND POLICYMAKERS AND THE CHAIR HAS SAID THAT 99% OR 98% WHATEVER NUMBER YOU USE MISTER CHAIR. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS I AM ONE OF THOSE THE CONCEPT MAY SOUND WONDERFUL BUT IT'S ALREADY BEING PROVIDED WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH CAL BRIGHT IS TAKING MONEY AWAY THAT COULD GO TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO HELP THEM PROVIDE MORE SERVICES. TO THE VERY STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THIS HELP. OKAY SEVEN MEMBER LETTUCE THE- THANK YOU SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU HAVE- IN THE TWENTY NINE- STUDENTS THAT HAVE COMPLETED PROGRAMS WERE OF THE TWENTY NINE STUDENTS HOW MANY OF THEM WERE ABLE TO BE PLACED OR- PROMOTED WITHIN THEIR FIELD. FOR JOBS SO FAR WE HAVE A PLACE YES SO FAR WE HAVE PLACED OUT ONE STUDENT AT IN A TRACK PLACEMENT AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OTHER STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING PROGRAMS. IN THEIR JOB MARKETS THE BIRCH GOING FORWARD. WE PLAN ON AT THAT THE LAUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS ALSO WILL THINK ABOUT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. WHAT STUDENTS ARE NAVIGATING THEIR CAREER FROM DAY ONE SO THAT THE CHOICES THAT WE ALSO MADE FOR NEW PROGRAMS. THAT REFLECT THE THAT THE CHORE ECONOMICALLY DISPLACED RIGHT NOW THOSE YOUR FAMILY RETAIL WORK AND HOSPITALITY OTHER AREAS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THE SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE CAN TRANSLATE INTO- THAT THE- THAT THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD AND SPACE. AT TO PROVIDE THEM TO INTO THE PLACES WHERE THERE'S EVEN MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. AND IS THERE A PLAN TO REGULARLY. COLLECT DATA AND REPORT ON THIS. YES SO- WE ARE AB GOING TO BE COLLECTING DATA ON JOB PLACEMENT AND WAGE GAINS AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING AS WE HEAR MORE AND STUDY MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET TO THIS POPULATION IN. THESE COMMUNITIES OF WORKERS IS THAT WE NEED BETTER DATA COLLECTION AND MORE DATA COLLECTION AROUND THE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE IN THE LABOR MARKET SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HEALTHCARE WE ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO KEEP THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE BUT TO HAVE THE NECESSARY SKILLS. THAT'S BASED ON THE WAY THAT HEALTH CARE DELIVERY ISN'T CHANGING OUR CONVERSATIONS ACTUALLY WITH AND SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN VERY INSTRUCTIVE VERY INFORMATIVE IN HELPING US TO DESIGN A PATHWAY THAT. MEETS THE NEEDS OF THEIR WORKFORCE AND THEIR FRONT LINE WORKERS AND WE IT ALSO SOMETIMES. AS I MENTIONED IN THIS CASE OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WERE LAUNCHING MOVING PEOPLE FROM AN INDUSTRY THAT IS AN ANTICLINE INDUSTRY INTO AN INDUSTRY OUT OF. OUR GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY AND CAREER EXPANSION FOR THEM SOMETIMES IT IS GOING FROM AN HOURLY JOB TO A BENEFITTED JOB. THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT I CUT OUTCOMES NEED TO BE TRACKING CODE GOING FORWARD AND WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF. DOING SO- IN THE FUTURE. I'M ONE PLACEMENT IS VERY CONCERNING WITH THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM- AND- IT RAISES FRANKLY RED FLAGS FOR ME- ARE. N. THE QUESTION. IS ARE THE PROGRAMS. ARE THE R. D. THE PROGRAM THAT EXIST OR THE- THE- ARE THEY WHAT WE NEED. I'M YOU'RE A IT YOU BE TO THREE NEW PATH. BUT FOR. SO HOW'S IS THAT STILL ON TRACK WHAT ARE THEY AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. THEY'RE GONNA PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE OUTCOMES NOW. YES I CAN TELL YOU I'M NOT SATISFIED OBVIOUSLY WITH- WITH THE NUMBERS SIGNED AT. STUDENT LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES I AM ALSO VERY EMPATHETIC TO THE REALITIES THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE FACING RAP OF THE REALITIES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HIRING MARKET AND SO- WHEN IT REQUIRES FOLKS TO. TAKE TIME TO PROGRESS WEEK WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN IT WHEN THAT JOB SEARCH EFFORT IT'S HARDER BECAUSE THE LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE MADE IT SO. THAT WE ARE ALSO THERE FOR THEM GOING FORWARD WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR STATUTORY. COMMITMENT TO THREE NEW PROGRAM PATHWAYS THE FIRST AS I MENTIONED THAT WAS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD WITH THIS TRADITION TO TECHNOLOGY PATHWAY. THAT'S A PATHWAY THAT LEADS TO AN INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED CERTIFICATION IN WHAT'S CALLED CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGEMENT SO IT'S THE ACTUAL SET OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMING. THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS- THE END BUSINESSES MAINTAIN CUSTOMER RELATIONS AS WELL AS- WELL AS ENGAGE IN SALES AND SO- OUR PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO MEET. AT THE GROWING CHANGING BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE- THAT BUSINESS SERVICES FOR MAKING THAT ARE CHANGING SOME OF THEIR SKILLS NEEDS- SO FOCUSING ON THOSE AND FOCUSING ON TRANSITION FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY DISPLACED INTO THOSE. ROLES ARE A KEY PART OF THAT WE ARE ALSO AS I MENTIONED IN DISCUSSIONS AROUND- WORK THAT WE ARE DOING IN THE HEALTHCARESPACE AT WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE. IS MEANT TO DRIVE IN UNDERSTAND UPSKILLING STRATEGY THAT IS RELATED TO SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES THAT-FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE FACING. IN THE IN THE IN THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH ABOUT. LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING FROM THE WORK AT S. C. A. U. U. H. W. OTHER TRAINING PARTNER FOR TOUR AND OTHERS HAVE DONE. TO REALLY ACT DOCUMENT IN THE MARKET WHAT SKILLS ARE NEEDED AND SO OUR PROGRAMS WILL B ALIGNED TO THAT AND THEY'LL BE IN. IN THE CALIBRATE WAY. WITH AN INTEGRATED SET OF. THAT AND THAT SUPPORT. AT THAT. FOR THE FOR THE WORKERS AND THIRTY. THAT RACK. AT PLANNING ON WATCHING PRO AND IS RELATED TO ADVANCE. SEVEN MANUFACTURING NEEDS BEEN FOR TRYST A RESPONSE GRANT FROM THE- THAT'S MOVING THE OFFICE OF. THE GOVERNOR. PLAN AND RESEARCH OFFICE THAT IS FOCUSED ON. WORKING WITH TEN. AND ADVANCE ANY. SPECIFICALLY THE DEFENSE SPACE WHO ARE LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND- HOW BEST TO APPLY WORK BASED LEARNING INTO- AND THOSE EXPERIENCES HANDS ON EXPERIENCES INTO- INTO TRAINING PATHWAYS IN A WAY THAT ALSO CHANGES THE WAY THAT WE DO. EMPLOYER ENGAGEMENT WITH AN INDUSTRY LIKE THAT AND THAT WILL LEAD TO BOTH ONE PATHWAY BUT ALSO. LIKELY A SERIES OF PATHWAYS AND- IN THAT FIELD SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ON TRACK TO DO FOR THE SUMMER- AND THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING WHICH I'M EXCITED TO SHARE MORE WITH YOU ABOUT- HALF MY STAFF. AND SHARE WITH YOUR STAFF MARK IS ALSO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS TO MAKE PATHWAYS THERE NOT ONE OFF. THEY ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN AN INSTANT INDUSTRY AND WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND SO WHICH I CONTINUE TO SEE FROM US GOING FORWARD. IS REFLECTED IN THAT DEEP UNDERSTANDING THAT EVEN NOW SAYS. THAT IN THE ABSTRACT BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHERE OPPORTUNITIES ARE LEARNER POPULATIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ALSO THAT WE WANNA HANG ONTO INTO JUST OURSELVES THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THIS RAIN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION OF COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. AND WE WHAT WE WANT TO BE EATEN WE RESPECTFUL DUPLICATION BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE STRONG PARTNERS FOR COLLEAGUES IN THE SYSTEM. AB WHO WANT TO ENGAGE IN THIS WORK. AND IMPLEMENT A DIFFERENCE. AND OF A- ACCREDITED- IMPACTS STUDENTS A BILL APPLY TO APPLY PROGRAM- SO IS CAL RIGHT SAW. TO APPLY FOR CREDITORS BY FIRST. AND HOW LONG WILL THE PRICE. YES I THINK IT THE QUESTION HE- WE ARE ON TRACK AND THAT THE STATUTE HASN'T NEEDING TO REACH- ACCOMMODATION HAVING SECURED ACCREDITATION BY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING ADEQUATE MUCH FASTER THAN THAT AND ME ARE SUBMITTING OUR APPLICATION AND NEXT MONTH AT THAT APPLICATION YEAH WE WILL YOU KNOW IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS THERE'S A CONDITION PROCESS ACOSTA REVEALED- WE NEED ESTIMATE. AT THAT WILL BE DONE AT OF. AND WE'RE DOING IT FOR ALSO CONCUR. LOOKING OUR- TO APPROVED FOR CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT BORING WITH A OF THE- YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID. WHICH IS THAT THE CAREER HAZARD FOR ME HAVING THAT BEEN THE FOCUS OF MY BACKGROUND BUT- WE ARE CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED FOR THAT AND IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS NOT. BECAUSE IT NECESSARILY JUST CRIED REVENUE TO THE CALLS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY YEAH IT'S THE MISSING SUPPORT THAT THAT MORE OF OUR STUDENTS NEED. AT IN ORDER TO REALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE AND HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM IN ORDER TO. FIND THIS THE BEST THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO STUDY PARTICULARLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND THAT'S ENDEMIC IT'S JUST. IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR LEARNERS. INTEREST SOMEONE PRESIDENT. SO THEN WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S IN FIVE. A PROGRAM I'M HAVING. NOT HAVING. TO STATE AND FEDERAL. AID PROGRAMS HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED YOUR- ENROLLMENT EFFORTS. I THINK THE PANDEMIC IS AND HAS BEEN HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LEARNERS- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO RECRUIT STUDENTS INTO COLLEGE WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON. MAINTAINING THAT EXTREME OF FIVE HUNDRED AND MOMENTS- AS WE HAVE REFINED ASPECTS OF THIS HEARING TESTED MADE TO THE NECESSARY CHANGES THAT I TALKED ABOUT. NOT GOING FORWARD WE'RE ACTUALLY WELL POSITIONED TO GROW THOSE ENROLLMENTS AS I MENTIONED OUR PLAN TO GROW FROM FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED IS MUCH MORE ABOUT. OUR ARE STACKING ON NEW PROGRAMS ARE AND REACHING A LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE COLLEGE AND INCREASED CAPACITY AT WITH THE CURRENT BUDGET APPLICATION THAT WE HAVE- TO BE ABLE TO- TO BE ABLE TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN A WAY AT. THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE QUALITY FRONT AND CENTER AND IS FOCUSED ON AND THESE ARE POPULATIONS AND- THANK YOU. IT OKAY. OKAY YEAH OVERLOOKING THE LAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT'S TRUE GALLAGHER HAVE THERE FOR A SEC. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOOD DID YOU WANT TO ENGAGE ON THAT COVERAGE YEAH. OTHER VOTER RAT WE'RE JUST WRAPPING UP HERE PERFECT APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING YOUR PRESENTATION OF AYE REPEAT ANYTHING I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- I KNOW YOU HEARD FROM THE OTHER MEMBERS REALLY- JUST CONCERNING YOUR ENROLLMENT SO CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A SENSE OF- WHERE YOU'RE A ROMAN IS NOW. YES WE'VE MAINTAINED A STEADY STREAM OF FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE COLLEGE- WE'VE AWARDED THIRTY FIVE CERTIFICATES HAVE WE ARE ALSO. A FINALIZING WITH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES EIGHT AND- CERTIFICATION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THAT WILL TAKE ON ROMANCE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND AND WILL GROW OUR PROGRAMS WITH A FOCUS ON QUALITY AND WITH A FOCUS TO MEETING KEY ORGANIZATIONAL MILESTONES THAT WILL NEED. IN ORDER TO BUILD THE APACITY OF THE CULTURE CERTAINLY MORE STUDENTS SO WE ARE- WE ARE MAKING STEADY AT AROUND FIVE HUNDRED MOMENTS BUT- I AM. YEAH I AM AS I MENTIONED TO. THE REST OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M NOT SATISFIED THAT THESE NUMBERS WE ARE. CONTINUING TO HIT THINK SALARY DURING CONTINUING TO MOVE OUR WORK FORWARD IN WAYS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL THAT INCLUDES. THE LAUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS THIS SPRING ARE THE FIRST OF WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BOARD WHICH IS VERY MUCH GEARED TOWARDS. HELPING INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION INTO NEW CAREERS IN TECHNOLOGY PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON DISCONNECTED WORKERS WHO ARE IN RETAIL WERE IN HOSPITALITY WHO IN AREAS OF THE ECONOMY WITH. GREATER UNCERTAINTY AND RECOVERY AND SO OUR EFFORTS ARE VERY MUCH ABOUT SEEING HOW THEY CAN USE THE SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE. WITH NEW CONTACTED WITH SOME TECHNICAL SKILLS TO TRANSITION INTO. INSTANT CONTINUAL INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS THAT USE THAT TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND- IN IN THE COURSE OF. OF WORK BEING DONE BY THE FIVE YOU TO- WOULD YOU SAY THERE THEY'RE ACTIVE TO ARE THE JUST STUDENTS WHO ENROLL. BUT I THINK THE PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF THE FOR HUNDRED- YOU KNOW. ARE THEY ACT WORKING TOWARD THEIR SIR. OR THE GYM ON THE ON THE- LAST. YES AT NO THEIR THERE ACTIVE- AND IT'S A MESS I THINK. WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ABOUT THESE PRO. IS THAT THE ARE SELF PROGRAMS SO STUDENTS ACTION. NO DON'T BE ON A TWO BASIS YEAH SET THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE AND THAT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS POPULATION HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. LARGELY BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME IN WHICH THEY NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY OFTEN THOSE FLEXIBILITIES TAKE THE FORM OF. NOT NEEDING TO STEP AWAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE THERE IS A FAMILY MEMBER TOLD HER THAT HER FAMILY THAT SIX. WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES FURTHER DOUBLING UP AS A TEACHER AT HOME- IF WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE STORIES MEET AND SURVEYS OUR STUDENTS. AND ADD DURING THE PANDEMIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE AFFECTED BY THAT THE PANDEMIC AND REALLY ADVERSE WAYS IN WAYS THAT- INCLUDED THINGS LIKE THEY HAD. EXPERIENCED JOB LOSS OR FOR LOW OR FAT LOSS OF INCOME IN HOURS A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT HAS MADE IT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HAVE EDUCATION BE TOP OF MIND. SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WITH THAT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IS. CONTINUALLY TRYING TO SANCTION THEM CROWDING THEM ALONG ME COURAGE AND THEN I HAVE IT A TREMENDOUS. FIVE INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY BUT ALSO THREE FULL TIME FACULTY IN THE COUNSELING SPACE THAT REALLY DON'T WORK IN A SILENT WAY IS WE TYPICALLY SEE COLORS WORK TOGETHER. AND AS IN TEAMS AROUND THESE LEARNERS AND THAT'S THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S AN INNOVATION IN THE MODEL THAT- THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FALL. AND THEN AS AT A TIME WHEN THE REST OF THE SYSTEM TO COMMUNICATE SYSTEM THEIR ROMAN IS GOING DOWN. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN ON GETTING ENROLLMENT. GOING FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND. ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IT UNDER IS THAT THE ARE NEW. OF AND I AM. AND BUT- MIGHT BE MEMBERS MIGHT BE TIRED OF HEARING SAY IT- YEAH I EXPERIENCED TERRORISTS AND THEN OUR- WHAT HAPPENED ON THE- FOR. WHEN WHEN WE SEE THINGS IN A DECLINE IN A ROW TO PLACE BECAUSE THERE FOR PA COLLEGE. THAT ARE. THE SAME POP. SO IF YOU AT THE FOLLOWING MOMENT DATE WOULD HAVE NASH YOU SEE IT. OUR PRODUCT. FOR PROFIT. ARE IN MOMENTS ARE INCREASING WHILE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND- AND- RAMIS ARE DECREASING AND SO WE VERY MUCH OF THE DEAL ARE PART. OF A TRYING TO FIND NEW AND BETTER AND FLEXIBLE MODELS TO SERVE THIS POPULATION. BEING OF SERVICE TO THE BROADER WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND INCLUDING. I APOLOGIZE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT IS A DISH TO. THE OF PROFIT ARE HAVING MUCH SUCCESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COMMUNICATIVE. WELL I WILL SAY FROM MY EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST RECESSION- THERE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD CALL AN UNHOLY MARKETINGCYCLE. AT MARKETING TOURNAMENT FINAL WHAT THAT MEANS IS- THAT EXPERIENCE AT THE FRONT END OF AN INSTITUTION ENGAGES WITH THE STUDENT AND ACTUALLY- IN. THAT PROCESS ON THE PART OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS A COMMON KEEPS PINPOINT CROSSES INSTITUTIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO COUNTER ACT AGAINST THE FOR PROFIT SAYS- RECOGNIZING THAT WE WERE COLLECTING DATA ON OUR STUDENTS AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM. IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT WITH FALLING OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHY DO YOU THINK THE APPLICATION AND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AS WELL AS ADULTS STUDENTS AND- WE RECOMMENDED A SERIES OF CHANGES THERE. THAT NOT JUST BENEFIT ENROLLEES AT CALIBRATE STUDENTS COMING FROM THE SEPARATE POPULATIONS BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A PAIN POINT THAT OTHER SYSTEM COLLEGES- ARE GOING TO BE ARE EXPERIENCING AS WELL AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I HAVE SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH. THAT WHEN IT MANY OF THE COLLEAGUES MANY THE- KITCHENS I'VE HAD WITH. THE COLLEGES SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF WAYS IN WHICH BOTH ARE WORK BUT ALSO AT THE WORK THAT WE DO BENEFIT THE SORT OF COLLECTIVE STRENGTH WE NEED OF THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT SOME OF THAT THE TACTICS AND THE EFFECTS THAT WE SEE. OF THAT BACK RISKIER APPROACH FROM THE. PREDATORY FOR PROFITS. OKAY GOTCHA GREAT THANK YOU ONE THING I. AND ALSO- MEMINTA TO YOU IN THE PAST AS AN- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU INTERFACE WITH THE REST OF THE- SYSTEM AND ON YOUR CREE. MORE FOR SCANDAL. BUT IT'S- THAT- IT WOULD BENEFIT IF YOU HAD A- STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OTHER HUNDRED. PLUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAMPUSES AS WELL AND- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S HOW THAT'S GOING TO THE YOU CAN BOTH LEVERAGE. ON BOTH AIR STRIKES. NO THANK YOU I. APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTION WE ARE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE OPENED THE DOORS ON THAT ONE FOR SURE- BOTH WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. PARTNERS I HADN'T HAVE HAD MANY MORE CONVERSATION WITH COLLEAGUES. AT WE HAVE NO EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH PLACES LIKE BAKERSFIELD AND CONTENT- BUT WE'VE ALSO SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH THE KERN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND THE COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISRICT. TO EXTRAORDINARY DISTRICT LEADERS OF COLLEAGUES OF MINE WHO. WHO WHO SEE THAT SHARE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING UNDERSTAND THAT WORKING TOGETHER ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS ACTUALLY WILL. NOT WILL ENHANCE WHAT EACH OF US WOULD INDIVIDUALLY BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING THAT WE WILL DO MORE OF THAT GOING FORWARD AT THE OTHER PLACE FOR ENGAGING REALLY DIRECTLY IT'S NOT JUST WITH OUR SYSTEM COUNTERPARTS. BUT ALSO WITH THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM SO OUR NEW PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING LAUNCHED- IN IN. IN ENOUGH CONJUNCTION WITH WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH MORE AT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BOARDS IN FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS I'M MORE OF THAT WORK IS- IS ON THE HORIZON IS INTENTIONAL PART OF THE WAY THAT WE'LL DO OUR WORK GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT A SILVER BULLET SOLUTION WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT SILVER BULLET SOLUTION WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ENHANCING VALUE AND BUILDING THIS CAPACITY- COLLECTIVELY WITH THE SYSTEM. RIGHT I DON'T VIEW MYSELFAS- ANYTHING SEPARATE OR APART FROM. THEM WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IN THE CENTER I DON'T KNOW YOUR GOAL IS TO BE AT. FIVE THOUSAND EVENTUALLY WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR. YEAH IT'S A GREAT. SO WE I'M AND HAPPY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT DETAILS LAPORAN HOW THE- MOMENTS PROJECTIONS ARE- ARE SORT OF CALC. WHAT WE REALLY AT IS HOWEVER NEW PROGRAMS ONLINE WE'LL START THOSE PROGRAMS SMALL AND QUICKLY MOVED TO ACCELERATE TO SCALES OF THE SMALL CONDITIONS ALLOW FOR QUICK TESTING. THAT QUICK TESTING THAT ALLOWS US TO SCALE IN A WAY THAT IS MUCH MORE HIGH QUALITY AND SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS- YOU KNOW ENROLLMENTS. INCREASED MORE SHARPLY TOWARDS THE END OF THAT THREE YEAR WINDOW. AND THE INITIAL FOCUS OF THIS FIRST YEAR WILL BE ON A SETTING AND NO THREE THREE TO PROGRAMS. ATTENTION EVEN MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR- AND- IN USING THOSE. PROGRAMS TO GROW ARMAMENTS. OKAY GREAT FAVOR YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AS YOU CAN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS A LOT OF WORK TO DO WE'RE GONNA REVISIT THIS THE AUDIT COMMITTEE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THIS IS A POLICY BILL- SO THAT THIS IS NO ACTION ITEM- FOR NOW. WE COULD COME BACK LATER IN THE IN THE YEAR DEPENDING AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE- BUDGET FOR THIS AS WELL- SO WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THE HEARING AND PROCEED NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S NOBODY IN THE ROOM. IN PERSON SO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO DO ON- NOT ONLINE TO DO. THAT THROUGH THE TELEPHONE. TOLL FREE NUMBER IS. 1-877-692-8957 I THINK IT'S YOU CAN SEE IT TOO ON YOUR SCREEN.
