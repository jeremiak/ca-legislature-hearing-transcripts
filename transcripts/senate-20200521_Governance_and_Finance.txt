A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THIS BILL WE WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATED HER WORK LAST YEAR ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL WE'RE GONNA GO OVER TO SENATOR JACKSON TO PRESENT IN PERSON HERE IN FORTY TWO THREE ON SB NINETY SIX THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. YOUR CHAIR YES INDEED THE BILL COME BEFORE YOU WE WORK CLOSELY WITH A- YOUR COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THEN. THE BILL DID GET TO THE GOVERNOR. HE VETOED THE BILL WE ARE WORKING WITH HIS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOW. TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS- I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET THERE. THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL. IT WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM OF TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTIONS AND TAX EXEMPTIONS TO ENSURE WE ARE MAKING THE BEST USE. OF OUR EVER INCREASING LEAD LIMITED PUBLIC. TAX DOLLARS. ARE DIRE BUDGET SITUATION DUE TO THE COLD IT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC BRINGS THIS ISSUE TO THE FOR EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. THAN THE LAST TIME WE MET- WE ARE. SUFFERING NOW A AN UNEXPECTED- PLUMMETING OF OUR RESOURCES AND AS A RESULT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN SERVICES AND ESPECIALLY IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT AT LEAST A PERHAPS A TEN BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IF NOT MORE REMEMBERING THAT AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN WE TOOK SO MUCH OUT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WE HAVE NOT EVEN GOTTEN BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO PLUMMET AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPERIENCE OUT. THIS IS BASED UPON THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT EIGHTY TAX EXPENDITURES. THESE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE THAT INCLUDE TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTIONS SALES TAX. AND INCOME EXCLUSIONS THAT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAX COLLECTED IN EXCHANGE FOR IN INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN A LEGITIMATE GOAL. MANY TAX EXPENDITURES LOWER CREATED DECADES AGO WHICH CHIEF CERTAIN GOALS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS AT THE TIME SEARCHERS IMPROVING INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS INCLUDING TAX PAYER BEHAVIOR FOR SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH ALL WERE GOALS. BUT THEY HAVE SPENT ON THE BOOKS FOR DECADES WITHOUT ANY SCRUTINY WITHOUT ANY OVER RIGHT OR EVEN THE NECESSARY DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THE WRIST WATCH THAT WERE SHOCKED. THIS TAX EXPENSE. A SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SAME SPENDING PROGRAMS THIS PAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE PAST YEARS NOT UP TO A CHANGE IN THIRD THIS YEAR TAX EXPENDITURES ALONE WITH THE STATE REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND BY SOME SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. YOU AREN'T BUT GENERAL FUND AND HAVE TOTAL. OUR FOR THE RE MENTIONED THOSE GOALS BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT. EVERY DOLLAR OF IT EXPENDITURES DOZEN GENERATE SCOTT IN NEW WERE TAKE PRIDE FOUR SAN. OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S CLASSROOMS VIA PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THESE TAX EXPENDITURES WORTH THEIR COST. IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION IT SHOULD BE A NON- POLITICAL QUESTION. IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THE- VALUE OR IN THE VALUE OF THAT THEY ANTICIPATED WHEN THESE TAX CREDITS WERE MADE. THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS WE HAVE NO IDEA. WE DON'T KNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER A TWENTY FIFTEEN AUDIT BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR REGARDING THE STATE'S TAX EXPENDITURES CONCLUDED QUOTE ADOPTING OVERSIGHT METHODS WOULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S CURRENT AND FUTURE TAX EXPENDITURES PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION AND A ACCOUNTING OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN IMPACT. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT BY THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS SCORED CALIFORNIA AS TRAILING WITH TWENTY EIGHT STATES AHEAD OF US IN EVALUATING THEIR TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INFORMING LEGISLATURE'S AS TO THE VALUE OF SUCH PROGRAMS. BILL WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST TAX EXPENDITURES TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEY'RE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. AND THIS BILL A CHOOSES AMONG THE LARGEST OF THE TAX CREDITS AND SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE NO METRICS OF EFFICACY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM NO SUN IN. REVENUE LOSSES OF GREATER THAN A BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED REQUEST AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. ANALYZE EACH TAX EXPENDITURES. TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE IN THE IN FACT ACHIEVING THE GOALS LEGISLATURE INTENDED. THE FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED TO A NON PARTISAN BOARD COMPRISED OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST THE STATE AUDITOR THE DIRECTIVE OF FINANCE OR THEIR DESIGNEES AND A REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE STATE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. THESE FINANCIAL EXPERTS WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE- GIVING THE LEGISLATURE A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE EFFICACY OF EACH OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES. THE BOARD HAVING CONSIDERED THAT INFORMATION MAKES THAT RECOMMENDATION. THE I URGE THAT THIS COMMITTEE. IN CONCERT WITH THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE DO MEMBERS HERE TODAY UP HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER THE UC'S REPORT IN THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN THE BOARD'S EXISTENCE WE'LL SUNSET SIX MONTHS AFTER THIS HEARING. IT'S MY HOPE THEN THAT FOR ANY TAX EXPENDITURES FOUND TO OUT LEAVE THE POOR STRAYED FROM ITS PURPOSE THE LEGISLATURE WILL THEN ULTIMATELY TAKE THE STEP- TO VOTE ALTER OR TERMINATE. OUR THESE ARE IN ON INEFFICIENT AND FAILING IF YOU WILL TAX CREDITS. I DON'T NEED TO SAY HOW- SIGNIFICANT THIS DEFICIT IS GOING TO BE FOR US THE FACT THAT EDUCATION IS GETTING HAMMERED THAT WE ARE GIVEN WHERE WE SHOULD BE AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN EDUCATION. SO GIVE THE DIRE BUDGETARY SITUATION AND THE LIKELY CUTS TO THESE KINDS OF SERVICES SERVICES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS- MEDI CAL BENEFITS DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CHILD CARE THING SO WE ALL CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. THIS MEASURE OUT WILL. PROVIDE A RUBRIC N. A METRIC GOING FORWARD SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BEING USED APPROPRIATELY. LEGISLATORS DESERVE TO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND- HAVE THE INFORMATION THIS WILL PROVIDE IN THEIR TOOL BOX. THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK OUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE I BELIEVE. THIS IS. A BRAVE NEW WORLD I BELIEVE AVAILABLE- AS WITNESSES ARCADY HARTMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION KRISTI PALMA REPRESENTING OUR STATE'S FIREFIGHTERS.

THE VICE CHAIR AND INTO MISS. AS HER TITLE. MR MAJORITY LEADER. THANK VERY MUCH MOISTURE. ONE OBSERVATION AND ONE QUESTION ON IN THE OCEAN I REMEMBER SITTING ON A CAR A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WITH WALLY KNOX IF YOU REMEMBER THAT NAME SOME YEARS AGO AND DIANE WATSON DAN WATSON SOME YEARS AGO DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME. JUST FOR THE RECORD IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS TAX CREDIT THINGS ARE TOUGH AND YOU KNOW I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THE MOTION PICTURE BUSINESS IS PRETTY BIG. A LOT OF GROUPS AND FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE DAY TO DAY ARE THERE AND A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED WITH THEIR LOCKS MISTER BAKERIES OR WHATEVER. AND WE HAVE A AN INDUSTRY IN THE MOTION PICTURE BUSINESS THAT. GO TO GEORGIA LOUISIANA OR CANADA. AND SO YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THESE TAX CREDITS. ON THE HAVE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS TO THEM. WE LEARNED THE HORRIBLE IMPACTS WHEN SOMEBODY WHO WORKS AS AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ON THE FILM. HAS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY FOR SIX WEEKS. WITH THOSE ARE FACTORS THAT WE LOOK TO AND ANNOUNCER IN THIS REGARD SHEER DIAGNOSTIC IS CRITICAL I DON'T DISAGREE. BUT I THINK THAT THESE ARE SO COMPLEX BECAUSE ON THE FACES ALWAYS EASY TO SAY OR MY GONE YOU'RE GIVING THESE TAX CREDITS WILL I LOST THE HIT WILL HEAD QUARTERS OF THE COMMITTEES ARE PRESENT FROM MACY'S. BECAUSE THEY JUST LEFT IN A WE LOST TO THE COMPANY THAT PUT THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE MOON FROM THE COMMUNITY THE HENRY STERN REPRESENTS. AND THERE'S A COMPLEX SERIES OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO THIS AND YOU MARIE THAT WITH OTHER IMPACT TONIGHT WITH WHICH CONCERNS ME AS WE MOVE FORWARD I JUST THINK IT'S A- PORTENT. IS ON THE- CLEAR THE DIAGNOSTIC HAS TO BE MADE BUT- BEING OF THESE PACKS MUST BE CONSIDERED RATHER THAN JUST THIS A YOU KNOW BALANCE SHEET APPROACH BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES IN THE AREAS THAT WE CARE ABOUT SO. IT'S EASY TO JUST JUMP ON IT AND SAY OH MY GOD THIS HURTS THE BUDGET NERVES ALL THESE THINGS AND OFTEN THERE ARE POLITICAL GROUPS THAT HAVE A LOT OF POWER THAT ENGAGE DO. YOU KNOW COULD SOME OF THE WRONG AND IS POST SOME THAT ARE. I CLEAN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS MADAM CHAIR. THAT SHOULD SHOULD BE CHANGED BECAUSE THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED THERE'S REASONS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IS WE THINK THIS THROUGH- THAT WE GET GUIDANCE TO LOOK AT IT IN THE BROADEST CONTEXT AND THAT OFTEN IT'S NOT JUST A BALLOT SHE DIAGNOSTIC IT'S A MUCH DEEPER DIAGNOSTIC. THE SECOND COURT THE SECOND PART OF MY ENQUIRIES A QUESTION. THE BILL WAS VETOED LAST YEAR ABOARD FOR IT WAS VETOED YOU ON PAGE EIGHT OF THIS ANALYSIS THERE ARE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE CHANGES. BUT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS ARE WE WASTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY GOING BACK AT THIS BOOK I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE ARE BECAUSE IT TOOK FORTY TWO TIMES TO PASS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN CONGRESS. BUT IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH MAYBE IT'S IMPORTANT POINTS LITTLE BILLION I DON'T CARE. IF YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THEM WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AND IF WE DON'T IT'S STILL A VALUABLE IDEA DON'T TAKE IT AWAY I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND. AS YOU ADDED UP THESE THINGS WHICH PART TO ME. DOES IS SECOND IN A THE ABILITY OF THIS BECOMING THE LAW OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF FOOD THE CHAIR PLEASE. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING LAST YEAR- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CLARIFY WHAT EXACTLY THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO DO AND AS YOU POINT OUT THIS BILL DOESN'T COME FROM A PLACE SAYS THESE ARE AT TAX CREDITS. WE WANT TO GET TO THEM AND YOU MENTION CHILLI THE FILM COMMISSION THAT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE NEED FOR THESE OTHER TAX CREDITS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE INDEED QUITE VALUABLE. AND WE'RE NOT TO THE THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY HEY. X. Y. AND Z. HAPPENS THEY'RE GOING TO THROW THAT OUT WHAT IT DOES IS TO CALL UPON THE UNIVERSITY TO DO A FOR ALL NOW. THEN SEVEN HOURS. VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT HAVE FISK AND POLICY OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE STATE THEN IT COMES TO THIS COMMITTEE WHERE IF THERE IS A CONCERN THAT PERHAPS A FAMILY BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IS WAS LISTED- HAS CREATED ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO THE STATE AND THAT HASN'T BEEN CONSIDERED IT CAN BE FACTORED IN AND THEN IT CALLS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS OVERS OVER THIS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS HERE. THE QUESTION TWO CLICK WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE TAX CREDITS AND CONTRARY TO THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE MADE ALL WE HAVE NOW IS A LIST. THESE ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURES IS THAT EXIST THIS IS WHAT THE STATE BLOOM. THESE TAX EXPENDITURES. MET US ISN'T A DOG INTO WHAT THEY ARE. THE WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THERE SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OR A YEAR THAT WE LOSE BECAUSE OF THEM PERIOD IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE. IT DOESN'T TELL YOU. HOW MUCH OF IF WE GIVE A DOLLAR WE GET FIVE DOLLARS BACK. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT'S WHY THE AUDITOR SAID HEY FOLKS. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD THIS INFORMATION THAT'S WHY THE PEW. CHARITABLE TRUSTS INDICATED THERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING WHAT THIS BILL IS ASKING US TO DO THAT ARE WAY AHEAD OF US INTO. RUNNING FOR NORTHEAST. IS INCENTIVES MAKE ANY SENSE SO I LOOK AT FILM ARE. THINK THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE CENTER HERTZBERG. WHAT WOULD. PROMPTLY SHE AND WE HAVE AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC. THAT THIS TIME AROUND YOU WILL GET THE MEASURE SIGN THE GOV. GOOD YEAH I JUST I AM. FOR MAKING IT FOR A RECORD FOR THE DELIVERY IN THIS BILL I JUST WOULD. SAY JUST TO EAT YOU PRO NOT FAR HELD AS WE- CANNOT CONVOLVULUS VERY A MAP. OVER RESILIENCY. RIGHT IT MAY BE CHEAPER TO BUY SOMETHING IN INDONESIA VIETNAM OR SOMETHING BUT YET THEY'RE STINGS WITH THE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED OR ALL KINDS OF THINGS. THAT MAYBE THERE'S VALUE TO BRING MANUFACTURING IN ADDITION TO THE JOBS. AND MAYBE YOU HAVE TO DO A TAX CREDIT TO DO THAT BUT YOU GET RESILIENCY OUT OF IT SO. I WAS TALKING TO THE FOLKS AT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WERE THERE MAKING A TRANSFORMER XIN THEIR PIPES IN THE WIRES OVERSEAS. CAN SAVE A FEW BUCKS. BUT THERE'S A VALUE TO HAVE IT HERE YOU KNOW. AND SO WHEN YOU DO THE DIAGNOSTIC IT'S JUST TO ME IN MAKING THIS RECORD WE WANT TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SHE TO REIMAGINE. AS WE SEEK TO BUILD AND I WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT THIS TOOL BECOME SOMETHING THAT IS JUST A BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS WITH. YOU CORRECTLY NOTE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT. IS THE PORT HAVE THE RIGHT I APPRECIATE YOUR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH LATER AT LAZY GENERAL CAN WE'RE GONNA GO THE VICE CHAIR AND SENATOR HER TANTO. THANK YOU MS CHAIR OF. CENTER JACKSON I THINK THIS IS. YOUR GOAL IS RIGHTEOUS AND I. JUST KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WAS TO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND WHY HAVEN'T THEY BEEN DOING IT AND IT'S SORT OF AN INDICTMENT AND I'M- CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR RINGING THE BELL. AGAIN. WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL IT'S BEFORE'S LATER TODAY BUT IT DID IT WOULD REQUIRE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO DO A STUDY AND I AND I WONDER IF WHY WE'RE NOT REQUIRING OUR EXISTING AGENCIES TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. ABOUT SETTING UP A WHOLE NEW BOARD- AT THIS TIME I JUST I'M JUST UNCOMFORTABLE JUST IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A GOOD PROJECT FOR OUR FELLOWS PROGRAM IS TO DIG IN AND- DO THIS AND FIGURE IT OUT. SO. I'M THE THING THAT MAKES ME EVEN. THE MORE UNCOMFORTABLE IS THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER WE DO ALL THIS YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND I WATCHED THE MOVIE CREDIT BUILD TWO YEARS AGO. I CAME HERE SAYING I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY MORE CREDITS BECAUSE I NEED MONEY TO PAY DOWN THESE PENSIONS. AND SO I THINK I WAS THE ONLY ABSTENTION ON THAT BILL EVERY OTHER SENATOR VOTED FOR THE CREDIT IT WAS JUST IT WAS JUST A MOMENT HELLO WAS NOT. NECESSARILY A BILL YOU KNOW WE DID READ THE ARMY HAVE ANY DISCUSSION IT JUST KIND OF FLEW RIGHT THROUGH SO. SO IT'S KINDA CAPRICES EVEN AFTER WE DO ALL THIS WORK FOR STILL GONNA FIND AN EMOTIONAL. HOOK AND THEN IT'LL BE IGNORED AND- SO THEREFORE I AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF. THE CURRENT CLIMATE I WILL FIND MYSELF OF OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND I JUST BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RINGING THE BELL IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. MR MORE LIKE WE LIKE TO GO TO CENTER TITLED IN SENATOR BELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST LIKE TO ASK A QUICK QUESTION- FOLLOWED WITH A COUPLE COMMENT FOLLOWED BY A QUESTION- PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I NOTICED THAT IN AND OF THE STATE OF THE BILL. IT INCLUDES ABOUT WHAT IS TO BE ASSESSED AND THAT INCLUDES THE FARM EQUIPMENT OUR MACHINERY. ESERVER IT REASON OR PURPOSE FOR HAVING THAT IN THERE OR- HI YES IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. OF THAT FORM TAX CREDIT I THINK GOES BACK TO THE FORTIES THROUGH THE FIFTIES- IT MAY BE THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY THERE OR NOT PROBABLY IT MAYBE WE SHOULD INCREASE IT. IT MAY BE THAT WE SHOULD DECREASE IT IT MAY BE THAT WE SHOULD JUST KEEP IT AS IT IS THERE MAY BE A- FARM MACHINERY MAYBE THERE'S A TYPE OF FARM MACHINERY THAT WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE OVER ANOTHER BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED WE JUST HAVE NEVER LOOKED AT IT IT DOES GENERATE TO I BELIEVE WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE- CREATE A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OF A TAX CREDITS TO THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES IT'S A LOOK THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS THAT PRESUMES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHAT IT DOES IS WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT THE VARIOUS TACTICS PICTURES CREDITS THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT CREATED WHAT AT LEAST A ONE BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR OR MORE. EXTRA AND THAT THESE WERE THE FOR. I THINK ELEVEN OR TWELVE THAT WE OBSERVED WHERE WE HAD NEVER DONE ANY OF THIS ANALYSIS. SO THE NOTION THAT BY DOING THE ANALYSIS WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE CREDIT. I THINK IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL. WILL DO OR IS DESIGNED TO DO. IT IS JUST SIMPLY DESIGNED TO LOOK AT THESE. CREDITS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THE SIGNIFICANT- TAX EXPENDITURES- AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD A HAVE DONE WHAT IT IS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. BE ARE STILL RELEVANT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO EITHER TO. ADJUST THEM TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE TIME IS SENATOR HERTZBERG SAID RESILIENCE. IS NOW POTENTIALLY A CRITERIA MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TEN YEARS AGO. BUT THE BEAUTY I THINK OF THIS MEASURE IS THAT IT CALLS FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTION PROBABLY THE FINEST IN THE WORLD IS WILLING TO DO WITH THIS STUDY WITHIN PUT BY THE WAY ON A VARIETY OF CRITERIA. YEAH AND POTENTIALLY INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE SUGGESTED IN THE- OPPOSE BUT IT MEANT. I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING HERE I'M NOT A FINANCIAL EXPERT TELLING THEM WHAT THAT HAS TO INCLUDE I WANT THEM TO DETERMINE BASED UPON WHAT THE INTENT IS OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHICH IS TO ANALYZE AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE TAX EXPENDITURES DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ARE YOU STILL DOING ITS OF THEY SHOULD BE CONTINUED. SO WE HAVE THEM DOING THE DATA AND THE FACT FINDING WE THEN TAKE IT TO THE FINANCIAL EXPERTS THE STATE TO DO THE ANALYSIS. THEY DO THE ANALYSIS THEN THE PUBLIC A CHANCE TO HAVE INPUT AND THEN COMES TO. AS POLICY MAY. THE SITE WE WANT WITH THE XIN. WHERE WANT TO. THERE'S A PAUL. I MEAN THAT'S THE NATURE WE ARE WHERE THE MACHINE. AND A BROUGHT HAVE BROKE THIS. THIS ALL IS. FINE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD FOR HERE WE DO. CHARGE. IT'S A TOTALLY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED NEUTRAL PROCESS IT IS NOT A- HAS ANY IDEOLOGY TO IT IS WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE AND I BELIEVE. WITH THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND ALL THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON I THINK IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT GOAL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE I JUST WANT TO KIND OF GIVE A BRIEF EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED YOU YOU SEE WOULD BE PART OF THE RESEARCH CRIED THEY WILL BE DOING THE RESEARCH RIGHT AND STOLE MY CONCERN IS THAT IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S HAVE A LOOK YOU HAVE. THAT RIPPLE. KHAN RIGHTS. WE HAVE- BUT WE DON'T HAVE A YOU SEE IN OUR IN IN OUR IN OUR REGION SO- OR AT LEAST IN THE SENATE DISTRICT OF THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY SO WE EAT YOU KNOW I'M JUST. BRING IN AND RAISING THE CONCERNED THAT IT WE'VE- I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HAVE SOMEONE. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THEIR EXPERTS AND- BUT IF YOU'RE NOT FROM THE REGION AND IF. AND IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING TO COMPREHEND AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS OF- THAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR LEGISLATION AND- AND WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE UP BUT AT THIS MOMENT I CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE CALLING UPON. EXPERTS WHO ARE AMONG THE FINEST FINANCIAL MINDS. IN THE WORLD. TO DO THIS RESEARCH SO. I DON'T THAT ONE NEEDS TO LIVE IN A IN A PARTICULAR. WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMICS OF THAT AREA. I EXPECT. THE THIS IS TO BE. LATE OUR- THEIR SON TRYING TO ALL OF THIS THERE WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES WHERE I SUSPECT THERE ARE INDEED PEOPLE. COME THIS. AS WELL BUT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THIS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPERTS IN ECONOMICS. THEY ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT BASELINE FOR US THEN WE ARE GOING TO THAT THERE THERE WILL BE THE LAYERS. BECAUSE IT COMES BACK THE LEGISLATURE IS THE OF THE SECTIONS WHICH TELL RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THAT IN POOR. A FROM THE POT. TERMINATION THE POLITICS OF DIFFERENT. SO I EXPECT THE CENTER FOR TAUGHT ARE THAT IF YOU FELT THAT THE INFORMATION HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY. OBTAINED TO THAT THERE WERE CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED THAT WARRANT. THAT YOU WILL HAVE THAT VOICE AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT BOYS WITH OUR WILL BE HEARD IN THE PRIOR TO THAT. BECAUSE WE KNOW AGRICULTURE LIVE A LOT OF AGRICULTURE MY DISTRICT TO. IS THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE SHORT SHRIFT. IT'S THE GOAL TO THE VIBE. THE STATE ARE. THINKING THANK YOU. CENTER TANTO THINKING TENER JACKSON WE LIKE TO GO TO SENATOR BELL AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR FINAL COMMENT. HE WOULD ALSO WILL COME A MOTION AT ANY TIME. PROMOTION BOTTOM LEADER. MISTER BELL YOUR COMMENTS FOR YEAH SUPPORT I HAVE SUPPORTED THIS- HOWEVER HAVE A PARTICULAR. TWIST TO MY VIEW ON THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE I THINK THAT. OF THE ECONOMIC PLACE THAT WE'RE CREATING WITH TAX CREDITS. WHAT I CALL ECONOMIC PLACE LIKE THE CENTER OF TECHNOLOGY- THERE'S BEEN CREATED- WAS THE RESULT OF THINGS LIKE THE TAX CREDIT THE REAL THE- FOR RD TAX CREDITS- THE- THE IN CITY ON THE SIDE THAT CALIFORNIA. SUPPORTED RESEARCH INTO MINE. THE INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN OUR UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE SYSTEM. IN THE END THE DIRECT- CONNECTION BETWEEN R. AND D. OF AND- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY ANY OTHER UNIVERSITIES. THAT HAVE YOU KNOW DONE A GREAT JOB AND- SUPPORTING- THE NEW IDEAS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND NEW- OF THE ECONOMY THAT WE NOW HAVE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS. THEY ARE INDEED UM TAX CREDIT. IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT IS REALLY BENEFITTED CALIFORNIA. IMMENSELY BEYOND WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE FROM- LIKE A NARROW ECONOMIC VIEW POINT OF THE OF THE OF THE TAX CREDIT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO LOCATE THEIR BUSINESS YEAR WHY. WE HAVE CREATED A POOR ECONOMIC PLACE SILICON VALLEY WHICH- I THINK- I WOULD QUESTION THE AGRICULTURAL BE THE NUMBER ONE THING TO THE CAR I THINK TECHNOLOGY IS. PROBABLY A LITTLE BIGGER IN TERMS OF THE- REVENUE THAT WE GET IN TERMS OF THE JOBS AND SO FORTH SO I JUST WANT TO ARGUE THAT TECHNOLOGY. IN CALIFORNIA BEEN A MAINSTAY OF OUR ECONOMY. AND THE RD TAX CREDIT HAS REALLY. HELP CREATE- VERSUS OTHER STATES THAT HAVE. DIRECTLY EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE MINUTE HAVE BEEN COMPETING AGAINST US. AND THEY'RE STILL DOING IT AND THEY STILL WILL DO IT BUT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS. THIS PIECE. TOGETHER BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE TO LOCATE BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE RD TAX CREDIT IS A BIG PART OF THAT SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT OF FOR MY AREA A LOT OF THE JOBS DEPEND ON THAT AND NOW A LOT OF OUR BIG COMPANIES. AND SMALL COMPANIES AND NEW COMPANIES UTILIZE THE RD TAX CREDIT FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR PLEASE I SUSPECT THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS ANALYSIS WILL SHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY- RECOMMENDATION TO REDUCE IT IN FACT THE FAX IT THE UNIVERSITY WILL COME UP WITH WILL PROBABLY SHOW THE EXTENT TO. OF THESE VERY TAX CREDITS HAVE BENEFITTED THE STATE- N. IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANT WAYS THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY SO. THIS GET A NEUTRAL THIS IS A FACT FINDING EFFORT. ARE THAT- IS JUST SIMPLY GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION GOING FORWARD. ABOUT WHAT WORKS. WHAT DOESN'T WORK WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE WHATEVER THE GOALS ARE THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE TERMINATE TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR WORK WHETHER WOULD LOOKING PERSONALLY SEE OVER. THING ELSE BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WE CHOSE THIS IS GOING TO GIVE US ADDED WE NEED A OF THOSE DISCUSS. FOR ARE. AND CAPTURE RIGHTS SENATOR BILL PERHAPS TECHNOLOGY HAS TAKEN OVER FROM MAC BUT LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY BOTH ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT STATE OF OUR WITH. APPLE SO. HEY HOW. ALL RIGHT. LAYS ENGINE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AND I ALSO WANT TO REMIND COMMITTEE THE ORIGINAL FORM THIS BILL LAST YEAR WAS LOOKING AT A STREET REPEAL- MANY TAX CREDITS IN WHAT. CENTER JACKSON HAS DONE OVER THEPAST MANY MONTHS- IN WORKING IN COORDINATION IN IN COLLABORATION WITH HIS COMMITTEE IS DEVELOPING A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH. WITH FINANCIAL EXPERTS AT THE TABLE- WHO COME FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND WE DO APPRECIATE TRULY AT CENTER JACKSON WORKING WITH US. LAST YEAR AND NOW THIS YEAR AGAIN SENATE JACKSON WE'RE GONNA GO TO FOR YOUR CLOTHES PLEASE VERY BRIEFLY I IT I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH. WITH FINANCIAL EXPERTS DOING THE INITIAL. DIAGNOSIS IF YOU WILL WITH INPUT FROM INDUSTRY THAT THERE THERE'S NO LIMIT HERE AS TO WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED OR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. IT WILL THEN MOVE ON TO BE REVIEWED FROM THE LANDS OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE OF THE STATE. WILL KNOW WHETHER. I THOSE ARE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS DATA. IN FACT. DOING BEAUTIFULLY THE WAY THEY ARE A MAYBE WHAT WE DID IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES IS STILL RELEVANT TODAY BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT WITHOUT A BILL LIKE THIS IN ORDER TO GIVE US THAT INFORMATION AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MADAME SENATOR THIS IT HAS A MOTION BY THE MAJORITY LEADER EIGHT TO DO PASSED YOU APPROPRIATIONS MISTER GRENADE.

BUT IN FOR MOST WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO SENATOR GLACIER TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN FORTY NINE THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND- GOOD MORNING SIR. IF YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF A HIGHER. PAYING MEMBERS AT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. WITH VOTER APPROVAL. TO RAISE COUNTY SALES TAXES ABOUT THE 2% THRESHOLD CURRENTLY IN PLACE. CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THEIR CONSTIUENTS. WITH A NUMBER OF SUPPORT SERVICES TO ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS THESE INCLUDE OF COURSE POLICE AND FIRE. HOMELESS SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. HE'S A SEARCH IS OUR POLITICALLY IMPORTANT DURING TIMES OF CRISIS. I DO COVE IT NINETEEN CITIES IN CONTRA COSTA ESTIMATING LOSSES IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE COUNTY ESTIMATES AND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED REVENUE. AT THE NEED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE IS LIKELY TO RISE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS PANDEMIC. THIS BILL IS A REASONABLE MEASURE TO POTENTIALLY ADDRESS FUNDING NEEDS IN THE COUNTY.

CENTER GLAZER OR YOURS. THANK YOU ARE CARE MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS. THIS BILL WILL EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR DISASTER REASSESSMENT FOR MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES AFFECTED BY THE CODE WITH NINETEEN AND THAT MAKE. BY EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY. MID YEAR PROPERTY TAX RELIEF UNTIL A PROPERTY RECOVERS ITS VALUE. IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING PANDEMIC STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENACTED STAY AT HOME ORDERS AS WERE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH. ALL THE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE FLAT IN THE CURVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE UNFORTUNATELY TO MEDI EMPLOYEES BEING LAID OFF. RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO FOR TENANTS TO PAY FOR THEIR MONTHLY RENTS IN RESPONSE GOVERNMENTS HAVE INSTITUTED MUCH NEEDED PROTECTIONS TO RENTERS. THIS RELIEF HOWEVER DOES NOT EXTEND THE MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR MORTGAGE PAYMENT. TAXES INSURANCE MAY IN SAN UTILITIES. MEMBERS I HAVE A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THE IMPACT THIS MEASURE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT THE HEART OF THIS MATTER. IS FAIRNESS. THERE IS TO IT. TO A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THOSE IN DISTRESS. FISCAL IMPACT. IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FAIR AND BALANCED RELIEF. FISCAL IMPACT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FAIR AND BALANCED RELIEF FOR THOSE IN NEED. I WANT TO NOTE THAT TO APPRECIATED THE WORK OF SENATOR HERTZBERG AND SENATOR WIENER. ON THIS LEGISLATION THEY HAVE SUGGESTED I PREPARED TO ACCEPT A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. TO THE BILL. IF IT MOVES FORWARD TODAY AND LET ME SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE AMENDMENTS IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. THE LIMITED VERY. TO IN NINETEEN WITH DECLARATORY LANGUAGE THE COVERT NINETEEN IS UNIQUE AS A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND THAT THE SHALL NOT BE A PRECEDENT FOR ANYTHING ELSE. FOR TWO WOULD SPECIFY THAT A PROPERTY OWNER CANNOT MAKE THIS REQUEST. IF YOU'RE RECEIVING OTHER TAX BENEFITS. POLITICAL THE NINETEEN. INCLUDING THE PROPOSED TAX CREDIT. TO THE PRO TENNIS TAX CREDIT RELIEF PROGRAM. NUMBER THREE GUARANTEE THAT THE REDUCTION AUTOMATICALLY ENDS WHEN THE CURRENT STATE OF EMERGENCY ENDS. AT THAT POINT THE ASSESSMENT IMMEDIATELY REVERTS WITHOUT ANY ACTION BY ANYONE TO THE ORIGINAL TAX ASSESSMENT. AND FINALLY SOMEONE CHANGES THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT. HE'S A SINCE THE POLICIES NAY- NEGATIVELY IMPACT PROPERTY VALUES DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ISSUED BY GOVERNOR NEW SO ON SO THERE'S CLARITY AND SPECIFICITY. THAT REGARD THIS BILL AND AIMS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY OWNERS WITH RELIEF. FROM IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL STRESS WHICH IF LEFT UNADDRESSED. THREATENS TO DESTABILIZE THE HOUSING MARKET AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER HIGH VOTE I HAVE HERE TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR. CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SO SHE- AND BRAD MARTIAN EXPERT PROPERTY TAX ATTORNEY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A TNCS TO MUCH MRS INNER GREAT FOR WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE YOU WERE THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF THIS CAN. EIGHT THERE ARE NO. CAN BE.

BUT TO BE TWO YEARS. SEVEN MEMBER. PHONE TEN MINUTES OR LESS. THOSE ARE THE OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST. BY IS PAN MAKE. IT'S QUE QUE. AND THEY WERE. PLACED OWNERS HAVE NO RELIEF. ARE THERE ARE A MORTGAGE PAYMENT. TAX PAYMENTS UTILITIES AND THE LIKE. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSESSORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THOSE WHO ARE OF FRIENDLY- AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO- HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE SMALL OWNERS AND- THE- OWNERS WERE PURCHASED IN. TENURE WILL BE THOSE THAT SEE. ARE POTENTIALLY. UNDER BILL YOU KNOW NOT WITHSTANDING THIS LEGISLATION THE REQUEST FOR REASSESSMENT WILL COME. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THESE SMALLER OWNERS CAN'T WAIT TO TWO OR THREE YEARS THAT IT OFTEN TAKES- UNDER THE EXISTING STATUTE. AS THE SENATOR- POINTED OUT THIS WILL ALLOW FOR REASSESSMENT SOONER RATHER THAN RATHER THAN LATER. I'M GONNA LEAVE THE- TWO ARE EXPERT MISTER BRAD OF MARCH TO PROVIDE YOU THE REMAINDER OF THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU MUCH. CAN WE PLEASE BEING HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT EARN THE OVER TO MISTER MARK. MARSH WITH IN TORY SIR MARSHY YOU HAVE MINUTES WE PREACH YOUR TEST TODAY FLOORS SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THE BOARD THANK YOU. I WAS. PROVIDED TO YOU TODAY BY THE CALVET. SOCIAL CLEARLY STAY. THAT ARE NOT BEING BY OR ANYONE ELSE I OWN RENTAL PROP. I AM SIMPLY TO TURN. PRE TAX TWENTY YEARS I'M A PROFESSOR I AM A TEACHER TAX IN CALIFORNIA IS ONLY THAT I KNOW OF PROPERTY TAX PROGRAM THAT'S THAT'S ENTIRELY OUR CLASS BUT THE PROPERTY TAX- ALSO THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. THE FORMER CAPITAL IN. LARKSPUR MORE LET ME START BY ANSWERING ONE OF THE PRIMARY HERE WHICH IS THE COST. IT'S. QUITE WELL BUT THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THIS. CONSTITUTION PERMITS THE LETTER TO PROVIDE CALL RELIEF QUOTE. TO TAXABLE PROPERTY PHYSICALLY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. AND THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WHICH WE'VE EXHAUSTIVELY REVIEWED. NOT SPECIFY ANY SPECIFIC TYPE OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY THE REASON WHY I'M STANDING HERE WITH A MASK BEHIND A PIECEOF GLASS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS CALLED CO EIGHTEEN. THE POSSIBILITY THAT AN ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLE COULD BE CONTAMINATED- IT COULD AFFECT THE PROPERTY TAX VALUE IS WELL ESTABLISHED- THERE'S A LINE OF CASES- AND IT'S AN OBVIOUS CONTEMPT LEADS TO THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PROPERTY. LEGISLATORS LATERS FUNCTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR WELL- IT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S PRAGUE TO INTERPRET IT. IN ADDITION TO THAT BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE BUT JUST A FEW YEARS AGOSENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH FOUR AUTHORED BY HUFF. PASSED THIS COMMITTEE PASSED THE ENTIRE AT LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS. WAS IMPORTER RANCH FOR A MATH IN LEAGUE OF IN THERE AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD SAY THAT THOSE HOUSES WERE NECESSARILY HIT WITH A FLOOD OR FIRE. BUT ALL THE SAME. COOL DAMAGE. THE ANALYSIS REFERENCES THE CASE SLOCUM VERSUS STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT CASE I DON'T THINK THAT CASES ON POINT BUT THE CASE IS ABOUT A REGULATION CREATED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUT THERE WAS NO SURE OF ANY PHYSICAL DE. YOUR OF. BUT WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS THAT'S AFFECTED OUR WHOLE WORLD REALLY- AND THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT INTERPRETATION. ANOTHER LARGE ISSUE RACES HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO ASSESSORS DETERMINE THE VALUE HOW DO WE DETERMINE THE VALUE. BOB AND I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF THOUGHT THIS BILL EASILY ADMINISTERED USING STANDARD APPRAISAL TECHNOLOGY- AND TECHNIQUES. BUT THIS IS THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE ASSESSORS ARE FREQUENTLY USING TODAY THEY ALREADY KNOW HOW TO USE THE CALAMITY PROVISION THAT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS. THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTION PIECE OF THERE IS A- OF A WELL ESTABLISHED AND WELL USE CODE- TREVIN TAX. FOR OVER TWO POINT ONE. ALREADY INSTRUCTS THE ASSESSORS ON HOW TO HANDLE IT FORCIBLE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS. AND THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE THE TYPE THAT ARE ADDRESSED HERE IN THIS BILL. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. TEMPORARY RELIEF TO THE SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SHOULDER THE HEAVY BURDEN. IN FIGHTING THIS COVERED NINE PANDEMIC I REMAIN AT YOUR SERVICE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SOMERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VERY GREAT.

THERE YOU GO WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK IN NOW LOOK TO THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVEN'T WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN A POSITION TO THE BILL. FIRST INFORMED THE SENATE FOR ANY TESTER DOT AND GARY COLE HE'S ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SISTERS ASSOCIATION WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY ALSO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA pWE'RE GOING TO JEFF KNEE ON THE LINE. FIRST AND FOREMOST GONNA OVER MISSED. PRES THE CALIFORNIA SAYS THIS. MISTER MODERATE TO HAVE. DA GET A CALL THE LINE. THE LINE IS OPEN GOOD MORNING MR SAID DO MORNING CURRENT LAW REMEMBER OF THE MAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING- I WANT TO SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST SISTERS ACROSS THE STATE. ECONOMIC AND IS FACING BUSINESS OWNERS AND HERE CAN BE. AND THE THAT THEY NEED HELP NOW. SO WE UNDERSTAND SENATOR GLAZERS DESIRE TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE YOUNG TO THOSE OWNERS HOWEVER WE BELIEVE. THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE SECTION ONE SEVENTY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH ARTICLE THIRTEEN SECTION FIFTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH AUTHORIZES THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDES AFTER LEAVING CASES. HOLDING OUT. YEAH WE ALSO BELIEVE THE CASE A SLOGAN BOARDED. PUBLISHED DECEMBER NINTH TWO THOUSAND FIVE- COURT OF APPEAL NUMBER ONE. IS A RELEVANT AND REJECTED THAT AS A BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TAPPED TO RULE ONE THIRTY NINE TO PROVIDE DISASTER RELIEF FOR ECONOMIC LOSS. ABSENT PHYSICAL DAMAGE. AS BEING CONFLICT WITH THE CAP CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. THE SENSORS THEY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY IMPLEMENTING AN EXISTING PROVISIONS OF ONE SEVENTY AS THEY RESPONDED RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY TO PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION CAUSED BY WILDFIRES THAT RAVAGED THE STATE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. ABLE TO DO SO AS IN AS THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE CONTEMPLATED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND SECTION ONE SEVENTY IS READILY DETERMINED. BY INSPECTION AND THE SENATE JUST IMAGE CAN BE DIRECTLY TO AND JUST WHEN ASSESSED VALUES. THE RELIEF FROM POTENTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES. IT WOULD BE ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD GERMAN THE POTENTIAL LOSSES- WOULD BE TIME CONSUMING TO DETERMINE AND DISCUSSION WITH PROPERTY OWNERS. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE ASSESSORS WOULD NEED A LOT BEING FORMED MARKET VALUE. PROPERTY DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE WOULD BE AFFECTED AND THEN APPLY THAT PERCENTAGE TO THE ASSESSED VALUE THIS IS A TIME WHEN THERE IS NO RELIABLE CURRENT MARKET STILL INTO. CORD CHANGES IN THE MARKET.

EXPRESS THAT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AT WITH YOUR BILL I CAN KEEP YOU MEAN WELL- BUT IT YOU KNOW. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THERE'S SOME- PEOPLE FOR MY DISTRICT ARE ARE- ORGANIZATIONS ARE JUST- ALSO CONCERNED AS WELL SO I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS THAT CONCERN BUT- WILL BE SUPPORTING YOU TODAY AND HELPING YOU MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. GOLDEN SO MUCH MADAM AT SENATOR WERE NOW GOING TO BE GOING TO SENATOR WIENER PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AS A FIVE THE AUTHOR INDICATED AT THE BEGINNING- HE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ME AND ALSO CENTER HERTZBERG- TO ADDRESS OUR CONSUMER CONCERNS ABOUT THE- REALLY THE BREATH OF THIS BILL. UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A REAL ISSUE HERE- AND- BUT YOU KNOW I'M MY INITIAL. TAKE ON THE BILL AND I THINK I WANNA SPEAKERS CENTER HERTZBERG BUT I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HAD THE SAME REACTION THAT. TO FIGHTING COULD HAVE SOME. CONCERT AND SO WE WERE TO A WITH THE AUTHOR AND PROPOSED A SERIES OF NOT AMENDMENTS TO TAKEN BY THE MAMMON SO WORK ON AFTER COMMITTEE IF THE BILL GETS OUT- TO SIGNIFICANTLY NARROW AND FOCUS THE BUILT ON SENATOR GLAZER DID- BRIEFLY GO OVER THEM I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION WHAT THEY ARE. ONE IS BEING THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC TO COPE WITH THE THOUGHT OCCURRED BUT AS AN EXAMPLE THIS IS A PURE. 101% COVERT ONLY BILL AND THERE WILL BE THAN LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN THE BILL- EXPLICITLY SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS PRESIDENT FOR ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY WE- HOPEFULLY ONCE IN A CENTURY IT'S BEEN HUNDRED TWO YEARS SINCE THIS HAPPENED. WE'LL BE ANOTHER HUNDRED TWO YEARS OR MORE BEFORE IT HAPPENS AGAIN BUT THIS IS A UNIQUE DISASTER AFFECTING- THINGS SO BROADLY. FRIENDLY THAN- YOU KNOW PROJECT WHILE FIRE THIS IS JUST BECAUSE BROAD AND DEEP AND SOCIETIES ABOUT WILL GO AND- CUT NOT NEXT- MENTIONS. TAKING A OF OTHER TÁI SPENT. I'M IN. IF IT ENDS UP NEAR PASS WHAT THE PRO IN THAT SOME HERTZ INCENTIVE ARE PROPOSING. WOODLAND TAX CREDITS CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. SO NO DOUBLE DIPPING- IN ADDITION THIS IS A REAL CONCERN FOR ME WHAT I DON'T WANT IS YOU HAVE A REDUCTION. AND THIS ENDS IN ANOTHER FIGHT BETWEEN THE PROPERTY ON IN THE ASSESSORS. WHETHER TO REFER TO THE PRE EXISTING- ASSESSMENT VALUE. AND SO THEY'LL BE AN AMENDMENT THAT SAID. THAT SAYS ONE THE STATE EMERGENCY. DIET REASSESSMENT AUTOMATICALLY BY CREATION OF LAW NO ACTION BY ANYONE THIS IS A FALSE. THE AUTOMATICALLY RIVER. THE PRIOR TAXES SO WE WON'T PUTTING UP ON THE ASSESSOR TO PICK A FIGHT TO GET THE RIVER AND ALL HAVE BY UPPER OF LAW IN ADDITION- THERE'LL REMOVES SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE LANDLORD TENANT ISSUE WE DON'T WANT TO THIS IS NOT- WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE FOCUS OF THIS- AND THE POTENTIALLY SET PRECEDENTS. AND SO IT'LL BE MORE JUST ALL ABOUT. INSOFAR ON UNTIL PROPERTY RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN AND WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE WE WORKING ON WITH THE AUTHOR. IN ADDITION I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENT WILL MAKE CLEAR AND I UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR. THAT THIS. BILL WILL ONLY APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL THAT IT WILL NOT APPLY TO COMMERCIAL I'M INCIDENTS- A COMMENT THAT THE SERVER FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND THIRD DEPUTY COUNTY CAL STATE ABOUT COMMERCIAL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE TIME. I BELIEVE THE TO WORKING ON DAUGHTER WILL MAKE CHRIS CLEAR THAT THE IS LIMITED TO A- AND SO THE ARE. THE MOMENTS WE WORKED OUT THAT I THINK DRAMATICALLY NARROW IN FOCUS- THIS BILL- I WOULD STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE CURRENT FORM. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS- I'M HAPPY TO- SUPPORT IT- AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WIENER AND GO TO SENATOR GLAZER THAN TO THE VICE CHAIR AND THEN CENTER NIELSEN- INCIDENT. ANY EVEN HAVE. I WOULD LIKE TO CONFIRM THE TESTIMONY THE CENTER FROM SAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE VERY GRATEFUL LET'S GO TO THE VICE CHAIR ADVICE MORE LAW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I GUESS I WOULD START BY SAYING THAT I'M A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR WAS FORMER CHAIR OF THE URBAN COUNTY CAUCUS AND ALSO ON THE. BORDER FIFTH ACT. SO I SORT OF COME FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT HERE SO I'M WATCHING CURRENT EVENTS AND I WATCHED SACRAMENTO FORCE A LOCKDOWN. CREATOR ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IMPACT SO MANY PEOPLE. NICE COUNTY IS THAT RELY ON PROPERTY TAXES WE WENT THROUGH PLENTY OF BATTLES. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WITH TRIPLE FLIP AND ALL KINDS OF FUN STUFF WHEN ARNOLD. WAS GOVERNOR. AND SO NOW WITH THE COUNTY RELIES ALMOST ENTIRELY ON. PROPERTY TAX REVENUES 92% FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. AND NOW. SACRAMENTO'S DOING A BILL THAT ONCE OUNTIES TO SUBSIDIZE THE ECONOMIC LOSSES THAT THE STATE CREATED. AND I'M HAVING A. HONEST PULL THAT INVESTED IN REAL NEVER RON AND HOW TO IMPORT PEOPLE I EIGHT I GET GET IT BUT I JUST SEE THAT THIS THE ANSWER THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER AND SO I MISTER MARSHALL. FORTY OH THREE FOURTEEN A PORCH MEET OUR NOT IN MY NOTES SO I LOOKED AT A- AND I DID NOT TO BY HOW FOR PORTER. IT'S CERTAINLY DID REAL WELL IN THE LEAD. BUT IT WAS THE- SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WAS. GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELD UP YOU KNOW OF COST IN THE COURTS IT WAS NEVER TESTED BUT CERTAINLY HAS. AS A SOME OF PRESS BUT- THIRTEEN A POOR DID NOT HAVE A MID YEAR REAL. PROVISION BUT I DIDN'T IT IF IT I MISS. A BARE SPOT IS PLACES GRAY G. COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR WITNESS. MARCIA MATURE ENOUGH THANK YOU VERY. PLEASE SIR PERCY. THAT WAS ALSO AT RELIEF BILL OF THE SAME TYPE THIS THESE ARE ALL THE SECTION ONCE A IS TOP RELIEF AND SOON AS THE MARKET VALUE GOES GOES UP AND AS I HEARD THESE MEN TODAY THAT WOULD ONCE ORDER ARE THEN THEY WOULD BACK TO THE STANDARD PARTY TAX BASE YOUR- IT OR- IT MAY BE A- THANK. INTERVIEW BUT NOT OUT.

I CERTAINLY RESPECT- APARTMENT OWNERS. AND TODAY RETURN MY PRACTICE DAYS HAD PLENTY OF THEM AS CLIENTS- BUT I'M I'M HAVING REAL DIFFICULTY WITH THIS APPROACH WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT- IS A LITTLE MORE FAIR TO THE- IT I GUESS- WOULD DRIVE WITH IT. COMPARED TO SAY THE TAMPON TAX WHERE WE DO A BILL WORDS KINDA NICE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES TAX BUT THE STATE DIDN'T. LOSE ANY MONEY. IT WAS THE LOCALS THAT LOST THE MONEY AND I JUST FIND IT. INAPPROPRIATE FOR SACRAMENTO. LOWERED TAX REVENUES TO LOCAL AGENCIES BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC OF THE DAY. AND FOR THAT. REASON FOR THAT RANT I- WILL BE OPPOSED TO YOUR BILL. THANK YOU SENATE BUDGET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR NEEDS IN THE MORNING. THE FOLLOWING. YOU KNOW I WAS.

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GO WITH IT. IN DIFFERENT GOING TO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I CAN SEE MARYLAND VALUE. ASSESSORS BUT SOMETIMES HAVE IN THE PAST RECESSED SOMETIMES THEY HAVE THERE BEEN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THIS ONE IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF MY LIFETIME. AND I EXPECT. AND THAT THEREFORE DISPOSES ME TO SEE THIS KIND OF RELIEF AND THE FACT IT DOES RELATE TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. BEST VENTURE CAPITAL OF OR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SOME RESOURCES AVAILABLE HISTORICALLY. HAVE INVESTING. AND THAT. NOT SO LIMóN ON. THANK YOU IT'LL HAPPEN DOWN THE WAY BUT AS- HAMMOND WHAT THEY I WILL BE A YES WELL I THINK SO MUCH CENTER NIELSEN WE ACTIVATED TO ALASKA FOR COM ARE QUITE LAW CALL COMMITTEE COMMON ARE. AT THIS TIME.

WAS ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND- VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GLACIER UP FOR HIS WORK ON SO MANY ISSUES AND OUR OUR CONVERSATION WAS THAT I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL I THINK. IT IS AN INTER CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES I DO BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ARE. REALLY CHALLENGING FOR LOCALS AT TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND AND IMPLEMENT THAT SAID UNDER.

HOUSE THE CAPTAIN IS THAT WE'RE GOING BE FAIR. TO BE FAIR ABOUT HOW WE- DO OUR OUR WORK GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT NARROWLY CRAFTED MULTI FAMILY NARROW COVERT NINETEEN NARROWED. SOMETHING THAT NONE OF US COULD EVER IMAGINE. QUESTIONS ABOUT PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND WHETHER IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL DOES ANYBODY DOUBT THE DAMAGE TO. OUR STATE AT SO MANY LEVELS INCLUDING A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY HUNDREDS ANYONE DOUBT THE DAMAGE SO THOSE THINGS WILL GET. DEBATED AND FOUGHT OVER PERHAPS IN THE COURT OF THIS BILL MOVES AHEAD.

THANK YOU TERRY EARLY MINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHOIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS TERRY ONLY WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION AS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF OUR FELLOW CO SPONSOR AND CHILD POVERTY CALIFORNIA GREAT THANK BUT I THINK SENATOR CAFIERO FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TODAY. CAPTION JUST TWO POINTS BRIEFLY FIRST WHY THIS BILL AND SECOND WHY NOW. FIRST SB FORTINO NINE WOULD BE SMART PUBLIC POLICY AND A GOOD GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL IN ANY LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED HOW IMPACTFUL EITC IS AS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ANTI POVERTY TOOL BY INVESTING IN IT EVERY YEAR SINCE IT WAS CREATED IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND ESPECIALLY MOST DRAMATICALLY LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS EXPANDED TO GO FARTHER UP THE INCOME SCALE AND ALSO BY CREATING THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT IT TARGETS HOUSEHOLDS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN TO BE IN THE BEST. POVERTY IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY IT MIGHT BE THE BEST BY MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO HELP ARE ACTUALLY GETTING CREDIT. FOR HEARING OUT HOW TO AUTOMATE MODERNIZE STREAMLINE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCESS. IS A SMART INVESTMENT TO WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS AS SUCCESSFUL AS I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO BE. CHECK IT WHY NOW. I'D SAY THAT EVERYTHING I JUST SAID TIMES A THOUSAND. YEAH HE'S HE IS ABOUT BOOSTING THE LOWER EARNINGS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO. IS PUT CASH INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS. SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO GENERATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT TRULY IS OFTEN MADE THE SITUATION WE'RE IN AN ACTUAL SITUATION WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR SOME TIME. IT WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND ENGAGE IN A HOT EXPERIMENT IN A MATCH. WHAT THINGS WOULD BE LIKE RIGHT NOW IF WE ACTUALLY HAD AUTOMATIC FILING IN PLACE RIGHT THIS MINUTE. IF WE DID WE CAN REST ASSURED THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE RECEIVING POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES IN A CHALLENGING ECONOMY. VERY OCCASIONALLY TO. BUT JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH IT WE'RE NOT OUT OF TIME. IN THE COMING YEARS WE'RE GOING TO NEED EVERY TOOL WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE HIT HARDEST BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND SO IT'S MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER GET THE CREDITS ARE GOING TO EVERYONE WHO'S ELIGIBLE. FINALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CONNECTION WITH THE FEDERAL CREDIT WHICH WAS REYES ANALYSIS. WELL THIS IS THE BILL AND SO DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE AN OUTCOME I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN THINK CREATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY HERE ABOUT CONNECTING ACROSS SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS FOR EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IN OTHER AREAS OF SUPPORT AS WELL. PEOPLE IN HARD TIMES YOU WERE BARRIERS TO GETTING HELP AND THIS CRISIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY BE THINK HOW WE DO THINGS. ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE IN NEED AND SEEKING FINANCIAL HELP IN THE COMING YEARS. BOTH PEOPLE AND OUR STATE PROGRAMS WOULD REALLY STAND TO BENEFIT GREATLY PEOPLE CAN TELL THEIR STORY ONCE AND RECEIVE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AND FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. WITH THAT I WOULD URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. TOTALLY NICE JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU WERE WITH US ON OUR LIVE LINE TO THE. THANK YOU SOME.

THANK YOU I'M- COMING WITH CPA HAD I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT- AFTER LAST RECESSION WE'VE KIND OF BEEN TOLD EVERYONE SHOULD BE AN EMPLOYEE. AS OPPOSED TO AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. SO EMPLOYEES RECEIVE W. TWOS AND HAVE PAYROLL TAXES WITHHELD SO THEY SHOULD. THEY SHOULD BE FILING JUST TO GET A REFUND IF THEY HAVE NO TAX TO BUT THEY STILL HAD SOMETHING WITH HELD- SO I'M- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHY SOMEONE WOULDN'T FILE MUST PERHAPS THEY WERE. AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WERE SELF EMPLOYED. BUT THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO FILE A TAX RETURN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. PAY SELF EMPLOYMENT TAX TO THE- US TREASURY SO EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF PROFIT THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO. A TAX RETURN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO HAVE SOME PROFIT SO THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PAY FOR RENT AND- FOOD AND ALL THE REST. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHICH PARENTS ARE LEFT THE HOW YOU DID HOW WOULD YOU WHY WOULD YOU NOT FILE A TAX RETURN A AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET. A UNDERSTANDING OF THIS NON FILERS STATUS AND SORT OF MAYBE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND. YOU KNOW A WONDERING WHY TO USE THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE USING TO ENFORCE AB FIVE OF POINT. AND USE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES INSTEAD TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. TO FILE BUT I SUPPORTED THE BILL. THAT WOULD- ALLOW SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS TO. BE ARTICLE QUALIFYING FOR THE EITC. AND SO ON NOW I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON AND HOW HOW DOES SOMEONE GET SO. TO PULL PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NO WITH HOLDINGS. BUT BUT THEY HAVE KIDS AND HOW HOW THE HOW THEY- HOW DOES IT WORK SENATOR MORE LOCKED UP THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY PLEASE THE CHALLENGE WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT QUALIFY FOR THE CALLIE T. I. T. C. IS% THAT THEIR INCOME IS SO LOW THAT THEY DON'T GET ANY MONEY BACK THEY JUST DON'T GET ANY MONEY AND SO THEY DON'T END UP. FILING A AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT THERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS CAL CAL YANKEES PROGRAM IN THE AND THE PROGRAM DESIGN THE BILL. OF THEIR INCOME SO THAT THEY GET INTO THE GET OUT OF THE DEEP POVERTY CATEGORY IT INTO THAT JUST PLAIN POOR CATEGORY FRANKLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT IT IS A REAL STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF A PUTTING REAL CASH INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE. OUR AND I DO DON'T BROUGHT ON MY HEAD THAT I'M THERE THE INCOME LEVELS ARE BUT- THE POVERTY LEVEL IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND- AND IT'S I THINK THE RANGE IS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE. A DAY ANYBODY UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND SO- WHEN THEY GET THERE EITC CHECK. A MAJORITY OF THE MONEY PAYS FOR THE BILLS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING INTERFACE FOR NECESSARY NECESSARY ITEMS AND SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT'S GOOD FOR. FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T END UP ON. IT IT HELPS THEM TO PAY OFF THINGS THAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH CABALLERO- ANY LESS- COMMENTS MISTER MEISTER BEFORE CHRISTMAS HURTS. YEAH WE HAD SOME. THIS POOR PERSON BATES IS BUILT OUT FROM THE- REST BOARD AND SO I WILL TO PICK ON. EVERY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. DO WE HAVE ANY. DATA THAT SHOWS. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE.

I HAD A TRIO OF OVERTIME BY TWENTY SIX AGO TO FIT OUT HOW ORANGE CAN TREASURER COLLECTOR COULD USE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF LEVERAGE AND NVEST IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF COURSE WHAT ENSUED IS NOW HISTORY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE FOR. TONIGHT BANK MUST ALMOST ONE POINT SEVEN DOLLARS FROM INAPPROPRIATE. AND A SET BACK THE COUNTY OF ORANGE DRAMATICALLY. MASSIVE RELY LOSSES. SHORTLY AFTER THE STRETCH FISCAL I WAS APPOINTED AS THE NEW TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND TWENTY FIVE YEAR IT WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY ON ON WHAT AND MARK SEVENTEEN THAT WOULD APPOINTED THAT THE GERMANS FAVORITE DAY OF THE YEAR. SEVEN AND SO A AFTER I BECAME TREASURER SERVICE TWELVE YOU'RE THERE FOR TWELVE YEARS I OFFERED NUMEROUS BILLS THE CLEANUP IMPROVES SECTIONS FIVE THREE SIX A ONE IN FIVE THREE SIX THREE FIVE OF THE INVESTMENT CODE FOR THE STATE. IN FACT. OUR CHAIR OF THE FORMER SUPERVISOR FOR CINEMA COUNTY I WAS ABLE TO HIGHER WEIGHT MY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER PAUL TALKING TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN HIS COUNTY AND I'M STILL BITTER ANYWAY. WICKS THOSE WERE INTERESTING TIMES EVERY BILL THAT DEALT WITH INVESTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS WHEN UNDER SEVERE SCRUTINY. OF THE SENSITIVE DAYS ARE LONG GONE BUT THE SIX THE SCRUTINY SHOULD STILL BE IN PLACE. THE INVESTMENT FIELD IS DYNAMIC IT EBBS AND FLOWS IT SEES NEW VEHICLES- AND WATCHES OTHERS LEAVE THE MARKET PLACE. IT MOVES AND THERE ARE THOSE TIMES WHEN THE CODE SHOULD ALSO BE MODIFIED TO ASSIST OUR TREASURES. AND OVERSIGHT BY. SB NINE NINE EIGHTY PROVIDES FOR SMALL BIT MOVE. FRIENDS ARE REGULAR UNDER THE- ANY ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY. PARTICULARLY UNDER RULE TO A SEVEN. WHICH I FOLLOWED FOR DOZEN YEARS BUT IT ALLOWS 1100% OF FUNDS TO BE INVESTED IN COMMERCIAL PAPER. BUT STATE CODE ALLOWS ONLY A MAXIMUM OF 40% FOR SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES OTHER CITIES ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO INVEST TWENTY FIVE THEN THE FOLIO IN COMMERCIAL PAPER SB NOT AN EIGHT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS SPECIAL TRICKS MATCHING ONE MILLION OR MORE TO ALSO INVEST TO NOW JUST 40% JUST LIKE LA AND SAN FRANCISCO. LARGE PORTFOLIO HAVE TO GET A CREDIT AND ADJOURNMENTS TOOLS AND RESOURCES IN THE SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE 40% IS THIS BILL WILL THAN HALF OF WHAT IS FOR IT FOR IN THE- AND WE WILL PERSONALLY POSIT ARE. PRESERVE SO THIS IS STILL A VERY SAFE MODE CATION. NOW A CLOSE THE DIVERSITY IN LIEU OF CAPPING THE TOTAL IS FROM IS SURE TO TEMP. AND COLLEAGUES THESE REQUESTS WOULD PROBABLY BE OMNIBUS BURKE MID BILL MATERIAL OR OPPORTUNITIES BUT- THERE REQUESTED. BY THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL TREASURES ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL NINE NINE EIGHT AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES. RICHARD I BELIEVE I HAVE A TOPPS MEDS FROM PALM DESERT ON THE LINE. YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH AT CENTER MORE LIKE WE PREACH THE VICE CHAIRS WORK ON THIS AND- ALWAYS LOVE WORKING WITH HIM. WE DO HAVE TO ONE. AS OUR LEAD WITH HIS IN SUPPORT THAT'S GOING TO BE TOM NANCY'S CHAIR THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL TREASURES ASSOCIATION. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM JOHN JOHNSON TODAY ON THE PHONE LINE HE'S THE DEPUTY TREASURER. FROM THE OFFICE THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER AT TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR IN THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNADINO. SO MISTER MODERATOR WERE LOOKING FOR A JOHN JOHNSON IN A TOM THAT'S WE'LL START WITH TOM NETS MISTER MODERATOR DO WE HAVE BOTH ON THE PHONE OR DO WE NEED TO GET THEM IN THE QUEUE. THEY ARE BOTH ONLINE INFO INNER MODE AND ARE FREE TO SPEAK THANK YOU SO MUCH SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE A MISTER THOMAS METS FIRST FROM THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL TREASURES ASSOCIATION MR MET'S YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOUR LIVE IN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU RIGHT A WRITER GOOD MORNING PERSON MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE GOVERNMENT AT FINANCE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM NETS I AM THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA MISSPOKE CHARGES ASSOCIATION I AM HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF CMJ THE BILL'S SPONSOR. SB NINE NINE EIGHT WILL UPDATE CLARIFYING STRING STATE INVESTMENT COAT IT HAS FOR PARKS AS BRYCE YOU'RE MORE LIKE YOU SAID. THE FIRST PART WOULD RAISE THE COMERCIAL PAPER CONCENTRATION OF THAT. FROM 25% 240% PRECISION SPECIAL DISTRICTS WITH A HUNDRED MILLION OF INVESTMENT. THE INTENTION IS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY PUTTING LARGE CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE COUNTY HERE'S- GETTING TO PART TWO OF THE BILL. THAT WOULD CORRECT EGHT. SINGLE YOUR CONSTANT LIMIT FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE LACK OF ONE FOR MEDIUM TERM NOTES FOR CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THE CURRENT 10% SINGLE ISSUE OUR CONCENTRATION LIMIT FOR COMMERCIAL PAPERS FOUGHT BECAUSE IT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON INSURERS OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER. ONE IS MANY THE ISSUERS ISSUE BETWEEN FIVE BILLION TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ABOUT STANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER YEAR. SO IN MY CITY EITHER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIO IF I BUY COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM ONE IT ISSUES TEN BILLION A YEAR MY SINGLE ISSUE OR LIMIT WOULD BE ONE BILLION DOLLARS THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF MY ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. IN THE CASE OF THE MEDIUM TERM NOTES THEY HAVE HIGHER CREDIT RISK MARSHALL PAPER YOU LONGER MATURITIES. THERE IS NO SINGLE KISHORE CONCENTRATION LIMIT. SO SB NINE NINE EIGHT WITH ESTABLISH A COMBINED 10% SINGLE ISSUE OUR CONCENTRATION MOMENT FOR BOTH COMMERCIAL PAPER AND MEDIUM TERM NOTES. CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS BASED UPON AGENCIES TOTAL. ASSETS BE NINE NINE NINE WOULD ADDRESS. REFLECTING LANGUAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE THAT EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDES INDIAN TRIBES AS PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC AGENCY INVESTMENT POOLS. AB THREE ZERO SEVEN NEXT SUNDAY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN RECOGNIZED CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES PUBLIC AGENCIES AND AUTHORIZED AND ENTER INTO JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT WITHOUT RESTRICTION. FORTUNATELY THIS IS BRENDA MIND BY A JOINT POWERS CODE LANGUAGE THAT PRE DATES AB THREE THERE ARE SEVEN. LANGUAGE IMPLIED ONLY PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ARE LOCAL AGENCIES INVEST IN JOINT POWERS INVESTMENT POOLS. SB NINE NINE EIGHT WHAT- ADDRESSES WITH CORRECTIVE LANGUAGE AND BUT ALSO FOR THE SECTION IN THE CODE STATING THAT INDIAN TRIBES ARE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE OR INVESTING JOINT OURS. POOLS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. OF THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT HAVE ORGANIZED RECALLS. DURING THE PARK FOR OF SB NINE EIGHT. AS FOR THINKING PART OF THE BILL IT'S STRANGE TO ANTICIPATED SITUATION THAT IS WITHOUT HISTORICAL PRECEDENT IN THIS COUNTRY THE POSSIBLE ADVENT OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES THIS COULD OCCUR EITHER THROUGH CENTRAL BANK ACTION OF MARKET FORCES. CURRENTLY TWELVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF GLOBAL DEBT IS AT NEGATIVE YIELDS. EUROPE AND JAPAN AND IN MARIN AND NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES FOR YEARS AND CANNOT GET OUT OF. WHAT SB NINE NINE EIGHT WOULD DO. A LIMITED EXCEPTION TO THE CODE AND ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO BUY AND HOLD ZERO OR NEGATIVE INTERESTED CRUEL US GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DURING A PROLONGED PERIOD OF. MARKET INTEREST RATES NOW THE PREFERRED. STRATEGY OF MOST LOCAL AGENCIES IN THAT. IN THAT PERIOD OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES WOULD BE TO DEPOSIT SURPLUS CASH INTO BANKS. THEIR STUDIO ENTRANCE THE COUNCIL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS FINE. BUT THERE CAN BE TWO ISSUES WITH THAT NUMBER ONE THE- INSTITUTIONS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT LARGE DEPOSIT TO THE CAPITAL RATIO CONSTRAINT. THE OTHER PROBLEM COULD BE IN THE PAST NEGATIVE CHARGES TO INSTITUTIONAL. IN OTHER WORDS IF I HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UNDER POSSIBLE BANK OF AMERICA AND THE BANK TO STOP IS TO IMPOSE. SPECIAL CHARGE EXTRA ONE PERCENT. ON THE DANISH BANKS IN EUROPE. THAT WOULD COST. SIX CHARGES ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS SO THOSE. OKAY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES NECK INTEREST SECURE MIGHT BE BETTER AT THE PRESENT PRINCIPLE BACK INCLUDES MY REMARKS THE REASON STATED JUST STATED CMT URGES YOUR VOTE I VOTE ON SB NINE NINE EIGHT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. A FEW MINUTES THANK YOU TO MIND YOUR THANK YOU.

FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION FIFTY THREE SIX OH ONE SPOT SIX. ON THE CURRENT LANGUAGE- AS TOM MENTIONED. REALLY PUT US IN A PICKLE- THE LANGUAGE WAS ADDED IN VERY WISELY SO IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO PREVENT ME. PURCHASE OF EXOTIC INSTRUMENTS OR DERIVATIVE TYPE INSTRUMENT THAT DON'T HAVE A NORMAL REGULAR CASH FLOW COMPONENT- YOU KNOW THOSE INSTRUMENTS SUMMER SPECIFICALLY- NAMED AND- SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THAT SECTION- BUT HAVE NO BUSINESS IN IN BEING PURCHASED IN A GOVERNMENT- INVESTMENT POOL ON OPERATING POOL. IT CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS IF WE START TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE- SCENARIO THE COUNTY SAN MARINO WE MANAGE A NINE MILLION DOLLAR INVEST TOOL- WE ARE TRICKLING RATED BY BEEN TRADING. WE HAVE VERY STRICT GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF DIVERSIFICATION AND WE HAVE TO NOT ONLY MEET OUR POLICY STANDARDS AND STATE CODE STANDARDS WE ALSO HAVE TO MANAGE TO VETERANS GUIDELINES WHICH REQUIRE DIVERSIFICATION- IF WE WERE TO HAVE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES WE WERE REALLY. VERY BOB. MENTIONED YEAH. IF WE WERE A TO BUY A SECURE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY WOULD BE NEGATIVE AND ONE THING TO CONSIDER IF WE WERE TRULY IN A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND WORKING MY- THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL BY NOW. AND IN FIVE BASIS POINTS THIS MORNING THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY AS TRADING AND THIRTY THREE BASIS POINTS THAT REALLY DOESN'T GIVE US A LOT OF ALTITUDE HERE AND- BED POWELL- CHAIRMAN POWELL IS SAID THAT. HE DOESN'T PLAN TO PURSUE A NAY. STRATEGY HOWEVER AND THE SAME. AND SAID THAT HE WOULD. PULL OUT ALL STOPS AND DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO. KEEP THE ECONOMY UPLOADED MEET THEIR DUAL MANDATE. SOME REAL THIS BILL WISELY DOES. IS IT ALLOWS US TO BUY US GOVERNMENT- SECURITIES EITHER ISSUED OR BACKED- IN THE IN THE EVENTS AND ONLY IN THE VAN AND DURING THE PERIOD OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES MAY NEGATIVE. RIGHT ARE I'M SIMPLY CANNOT MANAGE MY PORTFOLIO THAT THE ABILITY TO BUY U.
