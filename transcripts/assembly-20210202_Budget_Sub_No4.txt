I'M SO POPULATION NINETEEN CHANGES TO A MAJOR THINGS- WATER IS IT EXPANDS THE RULES FOR ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS TO TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY TAX BASIS- IF THEY MOVE. ON THE SECOND MAJOR CHANGES THAT LIMITS THE RULES FOR INHERITED PROPERTIES TO PASS TAX FREE FROM A PARENT. OR GRANDPARENT- TO A CHILD- THE FISCAL. IMPACT IS. IT SUPPOSED TO BE AND POSITIVE FOR STATE- HOWEVER THERE TO- MOVING P. THE FOR IS A PLUS- THE RULES FOR INHERITED PROPERTIES I WILL INCREASED TAX REVENUES- AND THAT WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MINUS- WHICH IS EXPANDING THE RULES FOR ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS. I WILL DECREASE TAX REVENUES I'M IN THE CITY TO GET HIS ROLE- IN THIS PROPOSITION IS ON THE MINUS PART. ON- THE CITY CAPITAL IS TO- IS LIMITED TO MAKING A WHOLE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LOSE- WHO'S OUT FAULTS- BUT THE CHANGES FROM- A PROBLEM THAT THE SPECTER OF- GFA. AS IF YOU WERE- FOR THE- THE FIRST AT THE GAS FROM FROM LOW AGENTS- WE WILL TRACK THE GAME AND LOTS OF. TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEN WE WILL REIMBURSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IF THEY HAVE A IF THEY. HAVE A NET LOSS. ONE THROUGH- WANTING TO PLAY OUT IS THERE NUMBER MOVING. PARTS WITH. NINETY SO THERE FIVE AT LEAST FROM THE C. T. SPURS THERE WOULD LIKELY NEED SOME REGULATION TO CLEAN UP POINTS OF AMBIGUITY AND THERE MAY BE A NEED FROM OTHER- DEPARTMENT- WHO ARE THROUGHOUT THE PART IN THIS- PROPOSITION TO. HAVE OTHER CHANGES ARE POTENTIALLY LEGISLATION- FOR BC P. WE REQUEST ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ONE AND A HALF POSITIONS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AN ONGOING- REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE ASK FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION- THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO USES- THE FIRST IS TO PROGRAM CROSS WHICH IS OUR- TAX- OPERATIONS I. T. SYSTEM. WHICH WORK WHICH WOULD COSTS- ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND A THE SECOND ELEMENT IS PERSONAL SERVICES EFFECTIVELY LABOR- TO GET FOR START UP COSTS- REGARDING REGULATIONS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE- THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH THE I THINK FOR THE MISTER MINIT WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH THE ADDITIONAL PANELS WE HAVE- MISTER KERN THINK. AND A MISTER SIMMONS. THANK YOU SAID CHRISTINE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. MISTER SEVENTH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON DEREK SIMMONS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO I ACTUALLY DO HAVE A QUESTION- OF MR MALLET IS THE IS THIS THE ONLY PROP NINETEEN IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE CD TFA WILL HAVE TO DO AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE A ROLE. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT SHARE CARILLO- I THINK AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POINTS OF AMBIGUITY- I WILL. MY WORLD IS CONFINED TO JUST THE CTF AS WELL POINT OUT TWO THINGS- ONE IS- OUR THIRTY TO COMPEL LOCALS TO GIVE US THE DATA NEEDED TO CALCULATE THE GAME LOSS IN THE SECOND IS. THE ACTUAL MATH ITSELF ON CAP WITH CALCULATING THE GAME LOSS THERE ARE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION I SAY THAT BECAUSE AT THIS TIME WE DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FUND REQUEST. HOWEVER GIVEN THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AND- IN THIS PROPOSITION TO EFFECTUATED INCLUDING- LOCALS- COUNTY AUDITORS- DEPARTMENT FINANCE AT CLX ADDRESS THERE MAY BE A NEED TO COME BACK LATER IF THERE IS MORE. COMPLEXITY THAN WE ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW. AND BY THERE MAY BE A NEED TO COME BACK LATER WITH THE APPROPRIATE TIME LINE THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDERING THAT WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT. I THINK WE WILL SO THE TIME TABLE ITSELF IS- WE WILL DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO LOSING- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- WHETHER THAT LOSS I'M EVERY THREE YEARS BUT FIRST- DISTRIBUTION- TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY HAVE A LOSS WOULD BE- AND CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR EARLY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE SHOULD HAVE GREATER CLARITY. THERE AREN'T THERE ALREADY HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF CALLS WITH THE SCO ASSESSORS COMMITTEE ON OTHERS- AND- FOLKS ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND IT I BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE SOME- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WHICH MAY COME INTO THEIR BUT I DON'T EXPECT THAT TO- AFFECTED CD TFA DIRECTLY. SO LONG AS THEY CAN I REGISTER WITH US ONLINE- SEND US THE INFORMATION IN ORDER FOR US TO DO THE MATH AND READING AT THE FIVE. AND DO YOU DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A DATA IN TERMS OF- THE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS THAT USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY- THAT ARE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REGISTER ONLINE AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE- BELIEVE. CALL THE NINETEEN HAS REALLY EXEMPLIFIED THE NEED TO OF BROADBAND ACROSS THE STATE AND HOW NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE THAT AND SOME I'M CURIOUS FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT PERCENTAGE HAS LOOK LIKE- I- I DON'T HAVE A PRECISE ANSWER PREACHER CORREO- I CAN SAY THAT- I HAVE A- ABOUT THE SMALL MICROCOSM OF. C. T. F. A. AS REVENUES WHICH TOTALED- APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY ONE BILLION JUSTIN ARE SACRAMENTO OFFICE WE RECEIVE A NUMBER OF PAPER- TAX RETURNS AND ALSO TAX PAYMENTS WHICH I BELIEVE SOME TO APPROXIMATELY A BILLION DOLLARS OF THE SEVENTY IN ADDITION WE HAVE- A NUMBER FIELD OFFICES THAT ALSO- I CAN COLLECT TAX PAYMENT ALIKE SO THE MAJORITY OF OUR- TAX PAYMENTS- AND TAX. COLLECTION ARE OVER THE INTERNET BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR THE EXAM PAPERS YOU AND AS YOU MENTIONED. AND IS THERE ARE- CAN YOU SHARE BRIEFLY IN TERMS OF THE COLLECTION OF PAPER AT LEAST ANY EXAMPLE FOR THE SACRAMENTO OFFICE WHAT THE WORKLOAD AND WITH THE STAFF OF ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE COME ACROSS- BASED ON. WORLD WORKING REMOTELY. ACCESS AT CETERA- SURE- SO- AS AS FAR AS STAFF WORKING IN OUR- WE CALLED THE TAX REVENUE BRANCH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED- I TEAM MEMBERS- WHO BASICALLY COLLECT TAX RETURNS TAX PAYMENTS KEY- PERTINENT INFORMATION INTO OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. CASH CHECKS DIGITIZED TAX RETURNS ETCETERA- WHAT WOULD YOU CAN YOU PLEASE CLARIFY WAS THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION NO I WAS JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE WORKLOAD HAS LOOK LIKE DURING THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF FOLKS THAT HAVE NEEDED TO TURN IN UP ACTUAL PAPERWORK VERSUS- ONLINE. SURE I DON'T KNOW IF THE- VOLUME OF PAPER RETURNS HAS INCREASED- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN- CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF PRECAUTIONS WE HAD TO TAKE AS A DEPARTMENT. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR OF OUR TEAM. NORMALLY THAT TEAM IS SPREAD ON TWO FLOORS- WE'VE SINCE EXPANDED. IT TO AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL FLOOR TO FACILITATE SIXTY DISTANCING SIX EXTRA. BUT THERE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN SOME CONCERNS ON THE ON THE SAFETY FRONT TOO I THINK- THE DEPARTMENT'S DONE QUITE A GOOD JOB DONE MANAGING THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO OKAY GREAT. SO THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL- PROPOSALS FROM THE CD TFA CAN ONLY MOVE ON TO THAT PLACE. AND WE STILL HAVE THE. THE SAME PANELISTS FOR THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO. I'M SO WE HAVE TWO OTHER ON BCPS- ONE IS EMPTY THE OTHERS. ALL START WITH CROSS BECAUSE THAT'S LARGER- SO OTHER CENTRALIZED REVENUE OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM OR CROSS- IS THE DEPARTMENT'S. TAX COLLECTION AND DISBURSEMENT IT SYSTEM WHICH WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY- THE FOURTH AND LAST IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRED WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY TEN SPECIAL TAX PROGRAMS. I'M INCLUDING CANNABIS LET ACID BATTERY AND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE TAX. ON THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE FINAL PHASES OF IMPLEMENTATION AND TRANSITION TO PRODUCTION SUPPORT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. THE RATIONALE BEHIND OUR REQUEST IS THAT NOW ACROSS HAS ALL THIRTY SEVEN TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS- WHICH BOND OVER SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR THE STATE- AND IT HAS ENABLED THE DEPARTMENT TO MODERNIZE- THROUGH MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY ON- TAX PAYMENTS AND TRACKING- FUND FLOWS. AS WELL AS EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. ON THE TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION THIRTEEN OF THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND WITH THE REMAINING TEN POINT NINE MILLION. BY SPECIAL FUNDS AND REIMBURSEMENTS THE USES UP TO TWENTY THREE POINT NINE MILLION THERE ARE SEVERAL BUCKETS- ONE. IS THE RELEASE OF CONTRACT WITH HOLDING UP SIX POINT SIX MILLION TO THE VENDOR. THE SECOND IS A MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS CONTRACT FOR NINE POINT NINE MILLION WHICH IS BROKEN DOWN BY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. FOR SOFTWARE LICENSING FEES. AND FOR THAT SUPPORT OF THE STEP POINT ONE. AND THE FINAL. IS A- FIVE HARDWARE FOR SERVE ANOTHER IT- NEEDS OF SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION AND THAT TOGETHER SOME TO THE TWENTY THREE POINT NINE. CRAMP THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM MR CRISTINA MISTER SIMMONS. STATE. WE HAVE NEVER SERVED IN. I BELIEVE HE SAID THEY HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. YOU'RE COMING YOU'RE YOU'RE BREAKING UP A LITTLE BIT BUT WE GOT YOU. MISTER SIMMONS. AFTER TENANTS PROPERTY FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU FOR THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I DO BELIEVE WE DO HAVE SOME MEMBERS ON- REMOTELY SO PLEASE TEXT ME AND LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS. YEAH SO I DO I DO HAVE A QUESTION- I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR MR VALUE MAY BE THAT THE BEST ONE TO ANSWER THAT BUT CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH ADDING A NEW PROGRAM COMPONENT TO THE CROSS SYSTEM. IN THE PAST CRISIS MARKETED AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO EASILY INCLUDE NEW COMPONENTS AS A NEW AS NEW LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED BUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE RARELY DISCUSSED HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT A NEW BILL CAN THE CD TFA. ARE COMMON ON THIS. SURE I'M AND I'M JOINED BY I'M VALERIE WILLIAMS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF OUR CROSS PROJECT AND SHE CAN CERTAINLY SUPPLEMENTED FAR GREATER DETAIL THAN I CAN- BUT I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS. WITH REGARDS TO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST- TO. ADD NEW LEGISLATION. ON IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TAX PROGRAM- I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES- ONE. WHERE THE TAX PROGRAM IS EASIER FOR US TO- IMPLEMENTED ANOTHER WHICH IT WAS HARDER. SILVA PROPOSITION NINETEEN THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. GIVEN THAT THE CD TFA IS ROLE. IS RATHER LIMITED- AND IN BROAD TERMS RELATIVE TO THE WHOLE PROPOSITION- THE REQUEST WITHOUT A FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION I'M TO ADD. TO THAT- ENABLE CROSS TO- THE MINISTER THE PROGRAM. IF YOU COMPARE THAT WITH A MORE COMPLEX CONTACT PROGRAM- CANNABIS IN LEAD ACID BATTERY IN ATTY STANDISH TRANSLATION. COST US SIX MILLION DOLLARS- TO- TO IMPLEMENT CROSS THE REASON I SITE THAT IS BECAUSE- OUR CANNABIS TAX PROGRAM IS. RELATIVELY COMPLEX AND SO THAT COST MORE AND PERHAPS I KNOW ABOUT WILLIAMS ON THE CALL. AND IS WORKING ON THE BASELINE I'M COST ESTIMATE. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ADD ADDITIONAL DETAIL- YES S. PART OF OUR- IMMINENT THREAT TO PROVE. SEEK REQUIRE THAT WOULD A BAY. FOR AND TAX. BUT EDUCATION STATE YES DID. ON WHAT THE LEGISLATION AND SO WE HAVE SEEN. IN ARE ABLE TO PUT IN A BRAND NEW TAX PROGRAM WITHIN ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO. WE HAVE. SEEN THOSE- AT OBJECTIVES. FOR THE PROJECT- OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISS WILLIAMS. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. ANYBODY ON THE ON THE LINE JUST GIVE IT A- NO HEARING NOTHING NONE WE CAN- THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME AND WE CAN MOVE ON TOWARDS A ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH HAS A NEW SET OF US THAT A PANELIST ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS RELATED TO THE GOLDEN STATE- STIMULUS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PROVIDE A ONE TIME SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR REFUND TO TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVED OTHER CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN. TAX YEAR- AND NON THIS PANEL WE HAVE- JAN HERRIMAN WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD A CHANCE ALAMO WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND J. CHAMBERLAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

RIGHT. NOW YOU'RE COMING IN AND OUT THE GIVE GIVE US THIRTY SECONDS LET'S SEE IF IT'S AN ISSUE WITH OUR I. T. DEPARTMENT US WE AS OUR TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT AS WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. DURING A BRIEF PAUSE AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT OUR TECH PROBLEMS. MORE LIKELY HAS AND THERE'S NOTHING. WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. REPORTER WE ARE GOING TO TRY AGAIN MISTER CHAMBERLAIN AND MAYBE A AN ISSUE WITH YOUR CONNECTION SO LET'S SEE IF WE COULD JUST HEAR YOUR COMMENTS- WITH YOUR VIDEO TURNED OFF AND HOPEFULLY THAT- THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD. OKAY HOW CAN EXIST BETTER YES IT IS MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO- SO MY NAME'S JAKE SHERMAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS IS A PROPOSAL TO QUICKLY GET MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF THE GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ECONOMICALLY HARMED BY THE KOPEN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE SPECIFIC. WOULD MAKE PAYMENTS OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THESE PAYMENTS ARE CONSIDERED A REFUND OF TAXES PAID BY THESE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WOULD BASED ON INCOME MISSION PROVIDED BY PROQUEST TAX WERE EITHER SEND CHECKS TO OR MAKE% DIRECT DEPOSITS. INTO THE BANK ACCOUNTS OF TAXPAYERS. RECEIVE CALIFORNIA THREE FOR THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TAX YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL TAXPAYERS WITH INDIVIDUAL TAX. IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ALSO KNOWN AS HEIGHTENS QUALIFY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ATC IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR WHICH IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EITC. THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX REFUNDS. FOR THE MURDER MAJORITY OF TAXPAYERS WITH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE ITC THE PAYMENTS WOULD GO OUT THREE TO FOUR WEEKS AFTER. WITH THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS GOING OUT OVER THE COMING FEW MONTHS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ATTACKS YOUR ITIN FILERS. PAYMENTS WOULD GO OUT SHORTLY AFTER THEY FILE THEIR TAX RETURNS. IN TOTAL THIS PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE CASH ASSISTANCE TO FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. MY COMMENTS- AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE HER TO QUESTIONS WHEN THE- WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON ON ENSURING THAT WE CAN HEAR YOUR YOUR COMMENTARY WE HAVE MS HERMAN AND MR ALAMO PLACE. WHEN WE GO WOOD MISTER ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. ADAM CHAIR- CHAD ALLEN- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS AND- AND- PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE WITH REGARD TO THAT THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ON FIRST. WE THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO USE ONE TIME MONEY FOR UP AND DEMOCRATS LEAF WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE- GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE STATE'S REVENUE WINDFALL IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M USING THESE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ONE TIME RELIEF EFFORTS APPEARS TO BE THE RIGHT APPROACH. I'M CERTAINLY. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS BEING PROPOSED- AS PART OF THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS REPRESENT A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THE STATE'S OVERALL ECONOMY SO THE FOCUS ISN'T NECESSARILY ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS. ON RATHER REVIEW THE FOCUS AS FILLING IN THE GAPS IN UNPRECEDENTED FEDERAL RELIEF PROGRAMS- THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED DURING THE PANDEMIC MOST NOTABLY THE- I'M FISCAL STIMULUS CHECKS THAT TAXPAYERS RECEIVED AS WELL AS- ENHANCED YOU I BENEFITS. THAT I'M UNEMPLOYED WORKERS RECEIVED THROUGHOUT. TWENTY TWENTY. ONE IN A IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT TARGETING THE STIMULUS CHECKS FOR- TO TWENTY NINETEEN EIT RECIPIENTS IS THE BEST APPROACH AT THIS TIME AND THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE- TWENTY NINETEEN EITC RECIPIENTS. ARM WERE ELIGIBLE THIS LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR THOSE FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS AS WELL AS ENHANCED YOU I PENNED OF IT PAYMENTS. ON WE THINK INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME NOW TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- AND THAT THE OVER ARCHING QUESTION WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO GRAPPLE WITH AS IT CONSIDERS ITS OWN APPROACH IS WHICH GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE HAVE BENEFITED LEAST. FROM FEDERALLY MEASURES AT THIS POINT- AND SERVE USING THAT QUESTION AS OUR GUIDING. MARK WE DO PROPOSE A AN ALTERNATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AT THIS TIME AND IN ESSENCE IT'S A MORE TARGETED PROPOSAL THAN THE GOVERNOR'S GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS I'M INSTEAD OF PROVIDING SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO- EITC RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS I TEND FILERS WHO RECEIVE THE EITC THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER MORE NARROWLY TARGETING SUPPORT. FOR THE I. TEN PILAR SPECIFICALLY- UNDER A SIMILAR INCOME THRESHOLD- SAY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND THIS MORE TARGETED APPROACH WOULD DIRECT STATE RESOURCES TO MORE. EFFECTIVELY FILL IN THE GAPS IN FEDERAL RELIEF PROGRAMS BECAUSE I TEN FILERS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS. OR ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS IN THE LAST YEAR WHEREAS EITC FILERS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. I'M WE BELIEVE THAT THE TARGETED APPROACH YOU COULD. YOU COULD LOOK AT PROVIDING BENEFITS TO. ITIN FILERS BASED ON THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY INCOME LEVELS AND THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME OF THE CHECKS TO BE DISTRIBUTED RATHER QUICKLY- AS JUST AN EXAMPLE AS SORT OF AN ILLUSTRATION- WE BELIEVE THE STATE TO PROVIDE A LARGER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR BENEFIT PER ADULT FILER WHO FILED WITHIN HIGH TEN. WITH EARNINGS ARE UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- AND THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD LIKELY COST BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND A BILLION DOLLARS- BECAUSE THIS MORE TARGETED APPROACH- WE BELIEVE WOULD- COST LESS THAN THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL PROPOSED- GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PACKAGE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER USING THE REMAINING FUND TO PROVIDE ONE TIME ASSISTANCE TO OTHER GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN EITHER DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMICS OR ALSO WHO HAVE BEEN IN ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY PROGRAMS I'M SO TOP OF MIND OUR TWO GROUPS. BOB FIRST WOULD BE- UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO DO NOT FILE TAXES WITH ITUNES AND SECONDLY WOULD BE- INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE STATE'S EXISTING SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OUT ONE TIME PAYMENTS TO THESE TWO GROUPS WOULD. LARGELY BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR OUR SUGGESTED APPROACH OF TARGETING WHERE FEDERALLY DOLLARS HAVE NOT MADE IT AS FAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ACTUALLY O HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BASED ON YOUR PRESENTATION BUT BEFORE I. I DO THAT LETS US SPEAK TO MISS HARMON FROM THE TO ATTRACT A FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. HELLO AND THANK YOU. SO JIMMY HARMON FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR MY INSERTION INTO THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING TO PRIMARILY BE FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED IN THE YOUR THAT IT FELT. NO QUESTION THAT THEY DID TO HELP TV SUPPORT I TO BY AS THEY THERE ARE PROCESS SYSTEM. ON THE INFORMATION IN REGARDS FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS ARE IMPROPER PAYMENTS AS WE CALL. BUDGET HEALTHY ATC AND THEN% INFORMATION ON EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. WHAT IS YOUR BUT I'M GONNA BE PROVIDED YOU CAN BE HERE FOR. MOST OF THE PHONES OR- A PROPOSAL THAT ARE ON TABLE TOWARD. AND A TO THAT GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. WILL LOOK LIKE. SO FIRST OF ALL THE TALK OF HOW F. BE. PROCESSES TAX RETURNS REGARDS TO AYE CHEN FILERS. SO FOR THE MOST PART THERE ARE MANY COMPATIBLES CHIU FIBERS THAT PILOTS AND I TEND TO THOSE THAT FILE WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. AFTER HIS AS MANY DATA ELEMENTS FROM MANY DATA SOURCES TO VALIDATE INFORMATION PRESENTED ON TAX RETURNS. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS MANY ITEMS OF PERSONAL DATA HAVE IN FACT BEEN COMPROMISED AND IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. THAT WE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE TOPIC THAT IS PRESENTING VERSUS WHETHER IT IS A BAD ACTOR. RIGHT TAXPAYERS WITH I TENS SOME OF THE DATA SOURCES THAT WE USUALLY ARE DELAYED. DO NOT EXIST R. MUST BE DRESSED ADDRESSED ON A MANUAL BASIS VERSUS AN AUTOMATED PROCESS. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE COULD BE- IN REGARDS TO TAXPAYERS THE PILE WITH AN AYE TEN DO NOT OBVIOUSLY- QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL CREDIT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FOR THE EITC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO THIS IS THE PRIMARY TOOL THAT WE UTILIZE WITH OUR CHILD THANK YOU SEE BY OTHERS THIS TO LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO WITH THEM NOT BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THAT CREDIT THAT LINK IS DESTROYED AN FTP HAS TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL DATA SOURCES TO DO USE SOME OF OUR RUBIO. ANOTHER COULD BE VALIDATING WAGES. WHICH CAN ALSO BE AND SOME SITUATIONS A MANUAL PROCESS FOR ITIN HOLDERS. I GENERALLY WE NEED TO RESEARCH THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THEY PROVIDED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS AND WORKED UNDER SO THAT WE CAN MUCH THEIR WAGES AND WITHHOLDING CLAIMED. AS WELL AS THE CALCULATION OF THE CALLIE EITC. YOU ALSO ASKED ABOUT LEVELS OF PRIDE. AS NOTED IMPROPER PAYMENTS THERE'S WHAT WE CALL THEM. THE FEDERAL EITC CREDIT HISTORICALLY INDICATED A HIGH LEVEL OF IMPROPER PAYMENT REQUEST. AS A RESULT FTV HAS REQUESTED AND BEEN GRANTED RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA THE IDC CREDITS I LOOK FOR IMPROPER PAYMENTS AND ADDRESS THEM ACCORDINGLY. FOR DOCTOR NINETEEN WHEN LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE FILING FULL OF TAXPAYERS THAT CLAIM THE CALIFORNIA YANKEE STADIUM THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. I HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED ABOUT THREE POINT 5% OF RETURNS FILED THAT WERE ULTIMATELY DEEMED AS EQUIVALENT TO IMPROPER PAYMENTS ON BOARD TONIGHT. THESE RETURNS HAVE REQUESTED REFUNDS TOTALING ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION WHICH IS ABOUT 13% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE CAL EA TO SEE A YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDITS. THAT WERE ALLOWED WHICH GEN GENERALLY JUST EXCEEDED ONE POINT ONE BILLION. LOOKING ONLY AT RETURNS CLAIMING THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT ABOUT 14% OF THOSE RETURNS FILED WERE ULTIMATELY DEEMED AS EQUIVALENT TO IMPROPER PAYMENTS AND WERE ULTIMATELY DENIED. THIS IS A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION WHICH PRESENTED A THREE POINT 5% THESE RETURNS CLAIMING THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT HAD REQUESTED REFUNDS TOTALING FIFTY SIX MILLION. AND ABOUT YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT CLAIMING. THE FINAL QUESTION ASKED WAS IN REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. AFTER THEIR MANY ENTITIES CALLING GAINS IN EDUCATION OUTRAGE FOR CULT CAL EITC ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE STATUS OF THIS PROPOSAL UNTIL LEGISLATION PASSES AS YOU KNOW ON THE PARAMETERS ND PARTICIPATION LEVELS IDENTIFIED IT IS DIFFICULT TO BEGAN A MARKETING CAMPAIGN. I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE UNIQUE EFFORT AFTER THE HAS ALREADY UPDATED OUR WEBSITE AND PHONE DIRECTORIES TO MENTION THE SPENDING PROPOSAL. WHILE YOU MAKE AS I NOTED IT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE WHEN THE GOVERNOR FIRST NOTICED THE PROPOSAL. AND THE MEDIA STARTED PUBLISHING THE PROPOSAL AFTER THE CONTACT CENTERS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CALLS ASKING ABOUT THE PROGRAM HOW CAN I GET THIS HOW CAN WHEN WILL I GET IT XCERRA. WE PROVIDED INFORMATION REGARDING THE PENDING STATUS OF THIS PROPOSAL BUT ALSO CHOSE TO UPDATE THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND FOUNDER TO BETTER ASSIST CALIFORNIANS. UPON PASSAGE OF A PROPOSAL MULTIPLE ENTITIES INCLUDING AFTER TODAY WILL CERTAINLY UPDATE OUR WEBSITE INFORMATION AND AS RELEVANT MARKETING MATERIALS AND CAMPAIGNS. JUGGLING THOSE CAMPAIGNS RELY ON MEDIA PLATFORMS AND SOCIAL MEDIA JOHN AND TEXT OPERATE STRATEGIES SOME MAILERS ON A RELATIVELY NEW STRATEGY THIS YEAR DISSEMINATING INFORMATION THREE NUMBERS FADE BANKS ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THOSE IN NEED. AS AN IMPORTANT STATISTIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANNUALLY BY APRIL FIFTEENTH OVER 95% OF TAXPAYERS CLAIMING THE EITC HOP ALREADY FILE. WHEN THIS PROPOSAL IS PASSED AND DEPENDING ON HOW ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED WHETHER THEY NEED TO JUST FILE A RETURN OR THEY NEED TO APPLY FOR CREDIT. THIS WILL DICTATE HOW MUCH OUTREACH IS MODIFIED FROM THE CURRENT EFFORTS WITH PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON FILING THE FEDERAL FOR THE FEDERAL EITC CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SEE AND OF COURSE UTILIZING FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICES PROVIDER. AT TO BE HONEST OTHERS WILL ENGAGE IN WIDESPREAD MARKETING CAMPAIGN STROLLER CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE STIMULUS PROGRAM. AND EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO CHANGE THAT STIMULUS PAYMENT. THE MEETING IS ALSO IMMENSELY HELPFUL IN THE SITUATION AS THEY GENERALLY COVER THESE TYPES OF MONETARY PROGRAMS. AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THE PROCESS USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND DISTRIBUTING STIMULUS CHECKS IS ALSO VALUABLE AS MANY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROCESS. AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME WITH THE URRENT PROPOSAL F. TO BE INTENDS TO SUBSTANTIALLY MARE. THAT DISTRIBUTION. AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'LL TURN OVER TO THE COMMITTEE FIRST IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER COOPER. MANAGER OF THE STAFF AND ALL THOSE POINTS OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD. GIVEN THE RECENT EXPERIENCE OF EVD AND FRAUD CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THE FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURES THIS PROPOSAL. THE THREAT TO BE. THANK HAPPY TO DO THAT SO- IN A SENSE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT WHETHER OUR ACTIVITIES IN RELATIONS TO PRODUCT NOTED. IT'S IN HER BEEN ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH- TAXPAYERS OR- BAD ACTORS PER SE TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THOSE ARE PROBABLY BAD ACTORS MEETING BOTH THE TIME BAD ACTORS WILL SIMPLY RESPONDED WAS THAT ALL OR WILL GIVE US ARMS AND BETTER- BUT MOST THE TIME BAD ACTORS JUST SIMPLY DO NOT RESPOND AT ALL. ON THE OTHER WHEN WE REACH OUT TO TOP SPARES THAT- HAVE FAILED OUR PROCESSING AT IT THAT A PRACTICE ON FRIDAY- THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH US AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT OUT TO LESSEN PROVIDE US THE INFORMATION NEEDED. SO THAT. WE CAN AND BOX- LET THE RETURN ALLOW. THIS CAN BE IS. AS SIMPLE AS- WHATEVER REASON WE COULD NOT FIND THEIR WTO TO VALIDATE THAT ACTUALLY HAD EARNED INCOME WHICH IS A PREDICATE SHAPING THE CREDIT. OR VALIDATING THAT ADDRESS OR SOMETIMES IT'S THEY HAVE FILED. AND CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL INFORMATION WE HAVE ON FILE LIKE ON THIS PERSON- X. FILES EVERY FEBRUARY ALL THE SUDDEN THEY'RE FILING IN JANUARY. SO THAT COULD BE. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THAT SHOULD BE A BECAUSE WHAT WE MIGHT SUGGEST LET ME REACH OUT AND VERIFY THAT THIS IS IN FACT THE TAXPAYER- THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AS OPPOSED TO A BAD ACTOR TRYING TO BE. INTO THE BUILDING AND GET- AN INAPPROPRIATE BUT- DOES THAT HELP ANSWER THE- IT DOESN'T YOU GUYS HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN A WRITTEN SOMEONE REPORT A LITTLE FAR RIGHT NOW IN THE PAST AND WHAT. IS THAT LEVEL BEEN AT WHAT WHAT WHAT NUMBER. YOU ARE SPEAKING IN REGARDS T THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CICADA CORRECT OR- YES SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE L. E. I. G. CIGARETTES- WHAT I WAS ABLE TO SURMISE FROM OUR DATA. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE POOL OF CLAIMANTS FOR THE KALYANJI C. CREDIT INCLUDING THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. ABOUT THREE POINT 5% RETURNS ULTIMATELY WERE HELD TO BE IMPROPER PAYMENTS AND TONIGHT. NOT WITH AN IRON FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CREDITS THAT WE WITH HELP FROM DISTRIBUTION- AND THAT COMPARES. A UNIVERSE THAT WE GET DISTRIBUTED THAT JUST EXCEEDED ONE POINT ONE BILLION. SO RIGHT ABOUT A 13% LEVEL OF- IMPROPER PAYMENTS THAT WE STOP. IF THAT HELPS THEM TO THE QUESTION. I'M I ALSO- DIVIDED IT UP TO LOOK AT JUST THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT BECAUSE THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT OF COURSE IS A VERY VALUABLE INCENTIVE. UNVIABLE TO TAXPAYERS BUT ALSO VALUABLE THE BAD ACTORS BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT. SO THE NUMBER OF RETURNS THAT WERE ON CHANGE SHOULD BE- IMPROPER PAYMENTS THAT RECLAIMING THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT WHERE ABOUT THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF RETURNS THAT WERE DEEMED IMPROPER FOR THE. ELECTED IN GENERAL. SO THAT WAS- AND- BUT THE ACTUAL FRAUD PERCENT OR THE- PAYMENT PER. WORK THE LET WHICH THE TWO. HOVERING RIGHT AT ABOUT FIFTEEN PER. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU. ON THE LINE WE HAVE MR CHIU THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS A FEW HIS OFFICE I KNOW WE'RE A LITTLE DELAYED SO WE'LL WAIT UNTIL HE'S ON. HELLO CAN YOU CAN HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TWO DEMONSTRATION WE JUST FIRST START BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR PROPOSED AROUND THE GOLDEN STATE SEAMLESS- AND THE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS I THINK DURING THIS TIME PERIOD- THAT LEVEL OF INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS AREN'T FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IS. VERY WELL RECEIVED CERTAINLY BY MANY. OF MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY AROUND THE L. A- SUGGESTIONS AROUND I TEN- WORKERS- YOU KNOW AS THE FORMER CHAIR THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND- WORKING ALONGSIDE OUR- LATINO CAUCUS AND OTHERS- WE REALLY. PRIORITIZE MAKING SURE THAT- THAT I TO WORKERS IN NINETEEN FAMILIES WERE BEING ASSISTED BY THIS PROGRAM. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL THAT WE CONSIDER A SPECIFICALLY A HIGHER PAYMENT. GIVEN THAT THIS IS A CLASS OF FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR. PREVIOUS FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS. YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. YOU MAY HAVE KIDS WERE U. S. CITIZENS BUT IT BOTH THEIR PARENTS ARE UNDOCUMENTED. THEY WANTED RECEIVED ANYTHING SIDE I'D LIKE TO ASK. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A PERSPECTIVE RIGHT NOW ON THAT ILIO. PROPOSAL IT CERTAINLY IS ONE THAT I WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT AND WANT TO SEE CONSIDERED. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBER- SO I GOT IT WOULD SAY WITH THEY'RE THEY'RE IS SOME. TO THAT. I THINK OUR CHRIS IS STILL GOOD THAT ARE OUR GOAL THIS FOR IS GET. MONEY TO ALL LOWER HOUSE. IN TO GET THE- IF YOU THAN JUST THE- HOUSE. WITH HIGH. TO- EXTRA. IT NOT IN THE HOUSEHOLD NEVER HEARD THIS ONE TO. WE ARE TAXES GET MONEY OUT TO A HOUSE. I THINK WHAT I WOULD CENTERS IS I SHARE THE I DEFINITELY WE NEED TO GET MONEY TO ALL. BUT TO ME THE OF THE ALLEY OWES. IS WE SHOULD CAN USING SOME OF OUR ONE TIME SAVING TO AUG- WHAT WE GET OUT TO I DIDN'T. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN HURTING- SO INTENSELY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AND THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED HELP FROM FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS SO- YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD JUST SUGGEST TO OUR COLLEAGUES. AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS BUDGET IF THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO LEAN INTO THAT PARTICULAR- IT CONSIDER CONSTITUENCIES- THAT WOULD BE GREAT- BUT A SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS AROUND OUTRAGE- YOU KNOW THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW- ITIN FILERS BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE THE TYPE OF BENEFITS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN. THE RESULT IN DRUG CALIFORNIA UP THERE ARE TRUSTED MESSENGERS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AS A OUT REACHED UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES AT DEATH AND I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT NGOS DOING IMPORTANT WORK TO WHICH- PEOPLE THAT. WOULDN'T THINK OF FILING OR WOULD BE A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF WHETHER THIS IS A REAL PROGRAM ACTUALLY DO SO- AGAIN TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND DO F. WOULD LOVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE- TO ENSURING THAT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH COMES FROM TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND- MESSED. THERE'S THAT ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT. YEAH I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO IT I DON'T WORK. SPECIFICALLY WITH OUTRAGE. BUT- I KNOW THAT THAT IS THESE KIND. YOU CERTAINLY USE SOCIAL TO USE- AT HOPEFULLY THE THESE CAN BE GROUP TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT- WHEN THIS WHEN. GOAL TAKE SIMILAR HIS AVAIL THE INTERACTIVE BECOMES AVAILABLE TO DO THAT MESSAGES OUT THERE- TO THAT THAT- WE CAN USE THOSE THOSE NEEDS TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE WE DO HAVE BUDGETED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE KERN RIVER FOR EHC AVERAGE WHICH WHICH. ARE WOULD. HOW THIS WOULD. I FIGURE ON THAT- WE WOULD PICK YOU GOT THIS YEAH FOR THE THROUGH THIS FROM ON THAT ALL THAT TIME THE DOLLARS. CORRECT WELL I'D LOVE IT IF POSSIBLE MAYBE I THIS YEAR IF WE COULD AN UPDATE FROM SOME YOUR CALL ON A WHAT THE AVERAGE WILL LIKE THE- WE KNOW WE'VE HAD DOING IN RE COMMITTEE. GENERAL ABOUT EARNING TAX. WE ALSO KNOW THEIR SUBPOPULATIONS EITHER BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION HURDLES- THAT THAT THAT LIKELY WOULD NEED MORE OUTREACH SO WE JUST LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SPECIFICS. ARE ARE THERE AS WELL- THIRD QUESTIONS AROUND THIS HYBRID YEAR ISSUE TAX YEAR NINETEEN VERSUS TWENTY- WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CONSTRUED GIVING FOLKS THE OPTION OF CHOOSING. UP FISCAL YEAR TWENTY YEAR NINETEEN AS THE TAX YEAR AS WE DO FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID OR OTHER FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS. I THINK THERE IS A WAVE WE DO PRIOR PRIOR YEAR TO COVER MORE OF THE POPULATION THAT NEED RELIEF AND NOT. RISK HAVING FOLKS CUT OFF BECAUSE OF YOUR THRESHOLD AND WONDERING. IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERED THAT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMETHING I HOPE THAT WE CAN REALLY DIVE INTO. CERTAINLY YEAH AND I THINK YOUR- IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE WHEN WE DEVELOP THIS PLAN IT WAS PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL STIMULUS BILL AND THERE'S REAL CONCERN. ABOUT GETTING MONEY OUT QUICKLY. HELLO CRITICALLY WITH IT WITH THE- FICTION. CRISIS MOVIE- WE DID GET A FEDERAL RELIEF BILL THAT THAT HELPED. TO SOME EXTENT. HELLO SO THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THERE IS. A PRIORITY TO GET THE MONEY OUT QUICKLY TO THESE FAMILIES IN NEED. AND SO THAT'S THAT IS STILL OUR OUR OUR FOCUS- ALTHOUGH I. CERTAINLY AND I AND ASK IF WE ARE TO. WAIT FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT YOU SEE. RETURNS TO BE FILED. WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO- EVERYBODY THERE WOULD BE A DELAY IN GETTING THAT MONEY OUT AND THAT'S THAT. THAT'S A CONCERN WE HAVE BEEN USING. TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY WELL I GUESS I THINK AN ONGOING COVER AND- I WON QUESTION I THINK THIS. FROM FOR FTP AND IT'S AS DIFFERENT TOP BUT A I'VE FROM LOT OF. SMALL BIG. BUSINESSES AROUND PER. AND BE A THAT. IF A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP HAS FAILED TO PAY FTP DURING THIS PANDEMIC- IT'S MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO QUALIFY FOR AID. TO HELP PAY OFF THEIR DEBTS SO FOR PUT ANOTHER WAY. WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT CAN'T QUALIFY FOR OUR STATE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF. BECAUSE FTP HASN'T BEEN PAID AND YOU GUYS ARE BASICALLY SAYING THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO APPLY- COULD YOU VERIFY FOR ME. AND I'M WONDERING IF FTP WOULD CONSIDER FOR THESE SMALLER SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS A DIFFERENT ROUTE. RATHER THAN AUTOMATICALLY PLACING LIENS ON THEM- WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS IS THESE ARE FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS F THEIR DEBT FROM FTP BUT THEY'RE ASKING FOR EXTENSION. TO SUBMIT TAXES- AND A WAY TO APPLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAMS ARE KIND OF CAUGHT IN THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO AND I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS BUT I WANTED TO KNOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO- LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE WERE. ALL IN TO HELP TAXPAYERS FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THE TAX LIABILITIES AND PILING UP THE TOP TO TURN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND RECESSION SO WE WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE NOT- MATHUR OBLIGATIONS THEY IN TURN THEY WERE NOT FULLY PAID OR THEY WERE ONLY PARTIALLY PAID IF THEY HAVEN'T PAID ANYTHING AT ALL- YES THEY DO TYPICALLY GO INTO OUR COLLECTIONS SYSTEMS- WE SEND MANY OUTRAGE LETTERS TO THEM AND WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MANY OF THEM TO CONTACT MORE- EFFORTS SUCH AS LEVEES ORLEANS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT I THINK THERE'S FIVE TO SIX LETTERS TYPICALLY THAT CAN BE SENT TO THE TAXPAYER- OUT REACHING FOR THEM TO WORK WITH US TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THEIR OUTSTANDING LIABILITY. THAT COULD BE SOMETHING AS AS AS GREAT AS OKAY YOU DON'T OWE IT BECAUSE THERE'S A CALCULATION ERROR ON YOUR RETURN. OR I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF A VERY MANAGEABLE LEVEL AND WILL ANALYZE THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT LEVEL IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND THEY NEED TO PAY THEIR OTHER OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING WAGES OF THEIR WORKERS- AND HE TAX LIABILITY IS WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO US INTO THE STATE IT. IS NOT THE MOST. IMPORTANT THING ON THE TABLE FOR THEM. I NOT FAMILIAR THE- SUCH THAT JUST WITH ARE BEING BARRED FROM QUALIFYING FOR A LOAN BECAUSE OF THE FACTS SO I WILL TAKE THAT AS AN ACTION ITEM AND SEE IF I CAN IDENTIFY MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. AND PRESENT IT TO HEAR DIRECTLY ABOUT WHAT WORK- BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE- ABS. DAMPENING THE WAY PERSONALLY. TO GET A LIFE LINE UP AS FAR AS A LOAN FOR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS LITERALLY STRUGGLING. DOES THAT HELP ANSWER THE QUESTION. WE APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP AFTER THIS WEEK WE ALSO WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE REACH OUT TO US ON THIS VERY QUESTION SO WE CAN. PUT YOU IN TOUCH. YEAH DEFINITELY THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND IF I MAY CAN I RESPOND TO YOUR- PREVIOUS QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH- SO I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON J. GAVE A GREAT OVERVIEW OF MENTIONING PARTICULARLY THE FIVE MILLION GRANT. FUNDING THAT IS INCORPORATED IN OUR BUDGET- AND WE PARTNER UP WITH A DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. GEN THREE THOSE GRANTS TO THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS THAT YOU'RE EXACTLY TALKING ABOUT THE NONPROFIT TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED. ON TRUST MESSENGERS. ON THREE OF THOSE EFFORTS- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A TROUBLES IN TEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. THAT ARE UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE STATE DEPENDING ON THE GEOGRAPHY THAT THEY ARE FOCUSED ON- AND FOCUSED AGAIN ON THE LANGUAGE OF THAT. GRAPHIC REGION SO WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF MATERIALS THAT WE CAN USE AN APP TO BE CONVERT SOME OF OUR MATERIALS AND THEN THOSE. TRUSTED MESSENGERS ALSO. CONVERT MATERIALS DIFFERENTLY IT'S A WEIRD FEELING EVERYTHING. FROM THE GROUND. CHECK TRIED TO GET- TAXPAYERS. REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS THEY MIGHT FACE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE KELLY AGENCY. COUPLE THINGS ON MY SUCH YOU- THAT ARE VERY IN- AND RELEVANT US. ABOUT OVER 90% OF THE FILERS THAT CLAIMED THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STAND WITH US UTILIZED SOME. STOP THEIR PRODUCT TO DO SO. AND THE SOFTWARE ITSELF. IS GOING TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA AGENCY WHETHER THEY KNEW ABOUT IT OR NOT IF THEY WENT INTO THAT STUFF FOR KNOWING ABOUT THE KELLY AGENCY THEY'LL BE VALIDATED AND IT'LL PRESENT ON THAT SOFTWARE ITSELF IF THEY WANTED TO THAT PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EITC. THAT'S WHY I WILL TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE WHICH IS THE GREAT THING ON SO THAT'S. GOING TO TAKE SOME- PRESS OFF OF THE OUT BUT OUTRAGE REMAINS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE TO FILE A RETURN OR MAY NOT HAVE TO FILE A RETURN BUT ARE OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT. SO WE STILL BELIEVE EDUCATION OUTREACH VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE SOME PHENOMENAL PARTNERS THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS THAT YOU REFER TO IT'S A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THEM AND SEE THE AMAZING THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS SO. I'M IN THE OFFICE OF THE ONE THING THAT IS GOOD ABOUT THE STIMULUS PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE. THEY ARE YOUR SHORT BE RELEVANT TO THE FILING OF A TAX RETURN. SO THAT ALSO TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF. AS BEING M. KNOW THAT I QUALIFY FOR THE STIMULUS JUST BY THE BANK EVEN IF I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE STIMULUS BUT I FILE MY RETURN. I'M NOW. GOING TO GET THAT STIMULUS PAYMENT. SO IT'S A OF MAKING SURE THEY OPEN THE MAIL. OR LOOK IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT FOR THAT MONEY AND THAT THEY TRUSTED IT THERE IS MORE SO THAN UNDERSTANDING HOW I'M GOING TO GET THE STIMULUS PAYMENT IF THAT HELPS AT ALL. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER AND IT'S A PRETTY THIN GAUGE ON THE STAND AND WALK AND I'LL SAY I. I HEAR WHAT OUR RICHARD DOING A LANGUAGE SIDE- WITH TEN LANGUAGES WHICH IS GREAT- SOME INFORMATION RELATED TO THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS. PROGRAM WHICH WAS KNOWN AS THE DRAY PROGRAM. WHICH OF US SOME MONTHS AGO PROVIDED A ONE TIME PAYMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. WHICH IS ACTUALLY LESS THAN 10% OF THE STATE'S UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY OVER TWO MILLION. PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I ALSO WANNA CORRELATED WITH AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT ACTUALLY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IN THE LA TIMES. LET THE LOCAL BUT NINETEEN. AND DEATHS HAVE HIT A HORRIFYING LEVELS UP TO ONE THOUSAND PERCENT. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. I BELIEVE. THAT REPRESENTATION MATTERS I AM- FORMALLY UNDOCUMENTED PERSON WHO'S BEEN NOW ELECTED INTO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK ABOUT. MY COMMUNITY AND THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF ANY. TYPE OF- ASSISTANCE- AND EVEN SO. ONLY 10% OF WHICH RECEIVED HELP FROM OUR STATE WHEN THEY NEEDED IT THE MOST. SO I'M I'M CURIOUS WITH THE L. A. OLD A PROPOSAL. IN AND- THEY SAID THE LEGISLATOR BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE THE REMAINING FUNDS TO TARGET HALF OR MORE OF THE STATE'S UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO DO NOT USE AN I. TEN. AND WOULD NOT AND WHO WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE. FOR A REFUND OR ANY TYPE OF A PROGRAM. HAS A SO CLEARLY- THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AND APPROACH WILL LEAVE LOW INCOME EARNERS OUT AND HAS THE- F. T. B. OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THOUGHT ABOUT ANY. OTHER WAYS TO TARGET THESE GROUPS. SO I I'M SORRY IS THAT A QUESTION FOR THE L. A. O. FOR. ITS AKUA FOR THE- OF FINE. AND F. T. F. T. B. BUT I WILL GO BACK TO YOU AS WELL. SO THIS IS THE SITUATION ROOM PART OF FUNDING SO- I TO OUR OUR- OUR FOCUS BEEN ON ON. PROPOSAL THAT. WE HAVE BEFORE US WHICH IS. TO TRY TO THOUSAND. NINETY C. TRACK AND THOSE. WITH TEN TO RECEIVE- YEAH HE'S TWENTY IS I WOULD NOT. CONSIDER THIS LARGER. FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT AND MISTER CHAIRMAN DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS- THANK YOU YES I AM JUST THAT- WE STAND READY A FINAL PROPOSAL IS AN ACTOR. AND WE CAN I THOSE RISKS. THAT ARE ALL FOR THE CREDIT AND HOW TO ANOTHER I AND COULD. MOVED TO A STRONG TO GET SOME EDGE OUT. GOING M. BUT ULTIMATELY IS DECIDED TO PUT ON I CAN. FOR THAT'S CREDIT ON WE HAVE A LONG HAS- WITHIN OURS TO AND FILE OF. TAX ACROSS THIS HAVE H. IT THERE THE ABILITY TO ISSUED LESS TO THEM- YES OF TO BE CAN- I'M BECAUSE- OF THE FACT GOING BACK- ASSEMBLY CHEESE. THAT A. B. F. T. V. OR GOV AND IN A ITSELF IS NOT A TRUST MESSENGER. THAT POPPED IN MY HEAD THE MOST WITH YOUR COMMENT IS ONCE WE GET A PROPOSAL ON THE GROUNDS WERE WERE ALL IN- AND I KNOW THAT THE NONPROFIT IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BATES TRUSTED MESSENGERS THAT ARE PROBABLY LISTENING IN ON THIS YEAR. ALL IN AS WELL- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THESE FOLKS NOTIFIED AND- A STIMULUS CHECK IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. IN THE HANDS. THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU KNOW I AM I AM EXCITED TO BE THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING FOR A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL NOT A CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. AND ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS MANY OF WHOM WHO HAVE SUFFERED SEVERELY DUE TO BE AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN. IGNORED FOR A LONG LONG TIME HAS ONLY BEEN. EXACERBATED AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF UNDOCUMENTED ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY COVERT NINETEEN. AND I'M YOU KNOW IT'S- I KEEP THINKING ABOUT PROPOSALS THAT WERE SEEN IN FRONT OF US THAT. ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO. NOT ACKNOWLEDGE. THIS PARTICULAR- POPULATION AND SO I FIND IT IMPORTANT THAT WHEN. THE L. A. O. PROPOSES SOMETHING THAT COULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER THAT. THAT WILL LOOK AT THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND SO I WANT TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO. MR ALAMO TO JUST GIVE US SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS INTO THE ALEJO'S PROPOSAL- THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FINE TUNED IN AN EFFORT TO TARGET THIS COMMUNITY. IT MADAM CHAIR- HAPPY TO OF COURSE. UP WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO GROUPS THAT WE CALL OUT AND- OUR ANALYSIS SO FIRST AND FOREMOST AS YOU MENTIONED UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE GONNA PILE I TENS AND SECONDARILY. A RECIPIENT OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM. THESE GROUPS FOR THE PRODUCT OF A FILTERING PROCESS GOING THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASK THEMSELVES. FIRST AND FOREMOST. WHO HAS BENEFITED THE LEAST FROM FEDERALLY ABOUT BIRDS- BUT ALSO. WHO WENT INTO THE PANDEMIC. IN MAYBE A PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL POSITION OR HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE SAME LEVEL COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. SOCIAL FILTERING THROUGH THOSE QUESTIONS THESE THE GROUPS THAT THAT WE IDENTIFIED SIMPLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERATION. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE EIGHTY DEGREE. THE TARGETING BENEFIT OF FOCUSING ON HIGH TEN FILERS ARE ALLOWS OR WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO ISSUE THESE PAYMENTS MORE QUICKLY- IDENTIFYING AND ORCHESTRATING A GRANT PROGRAM THROUGH. A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH. UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO DO NOT FILE WITH AYE TENS WILL TAKE LONGER- THE SPRING THE PROGRAM THAT DISASTER RELIEF- ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS. WAS A SMALLER PROGRAM OF COURSE. BUT THERE WERE REPORTS OF SERIOUS CHALLENGES WITH ADMINISTERING- THAT GRANT PROGRAM AT THE TIME. TO REACH A BROADER GROUP AS YOU MENTIONED- WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AN EXPANDED EFFORT. ON WITH RESPECT TO PARTICIPANTS THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GRAPPLE WITH THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT pTRADE OFFS FOR WHICHEVER ROUTE YOU WERE TO PURSUE. ON THE IT DOES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING AN EXISTING LARGELY COUNTY RUN ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE THROUGH HHS AGENCIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. I'M SO THERE IS A CLOSER TIE TO MANY. OF THESE FAMILIES OUT ONE EXAMPLE. WOULD BE TO A TRIED TO. CAL WERE FAMILY. WHO ARE HEADED BY AN ON DOCK IMMIGRANTS- SO THE SPAM. UP WOULD HAVE BEEN. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FEWER FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS NUMBER ALREADY WITHIN THE STATE'S SOCIAL SAFETY NET I COULD BE I- TARGETED FOR THIS MORE NARROW NARROWLY TARGETED- BENEFIT PROGRAM AS WE SUGGEST I'M HAPPY GOING TO MORE DETAIL OR ANSWER. ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I HOPE THAT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WERE WHAT YOU WERE ENQUIRING ABOUT. THAT'S DEFINITELY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT. TO THE NEXT THE- ISSUE.

BUT IN SOME CASES HUNDREDS IN SOME CASES DOZENS OF QUESTIONS DELAYED WHERE ARE OUR PARTNERS WERE CHECKING IN AND ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS AT THE GRANT APPLICATION PERIOD WAS OPEN AND BASS ON ROUND ONE WE ARE SEEING THAT THAT MONEY IS GETTING INTO THE HANDS OF THE MOST IMPACTED OUR BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. OVER 75% OF THE GRANTS WERE AWARDED TO DATE HAVE GONE TO US SEVERELY I'M SORRY APOLOGIES DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TWO THIRDS THE HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES AND WE HAVE SEEN A GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE. ALL UNDER THE STATE HOME ORDER SO WHILE WE'VE SEEN SUCCESSES AND. ALL OF THOSE ENGAGED- ALL THOSE ENGAGED APPROVED MATES OVER. TO MONITOR THE PROBE. WE JUST LAUNCHED AROUND TODAY THAT'S TO GO FOR US SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE EIGHT AND THEN WE WILL ISSUE ANOTHER SET OF AWARDS AT THAT POINT. I'M ON OUT REACH OUT WE KNOW THE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ABOUT THAT WILL AGAIN OUR- NETWORK OF FIVE HUNDRED PARTNERS DEVELOP DAILY WEBINARS PROMOTED EXTENSIVELY THEY'RE NOT WORKS THEIR SOCIAL AND EARNED MEDIA- THE THAT AGAIN BUT MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THOSE LANGUAGES TO ASSIST THOSE BUSINESSES- AND- AND WE ESTABLISHED. OUR INTERMEDIARY ESTABLISH A CALL CENTRE THAT RECEIVED. THOUSANDS OF CALLS DALY WITH QUESTIONS ON HOW TO FILL IN THE APPLICATION WHAT THE THINGS IN THE APPLICATIONS MEAN AND WITHOUT TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. D. AS WE SAW THAT THE DEMAND WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH- WE INCREASE THE FOR THE HOURS OF THE CALL CENTER AND AVAILABILITY OF CALL CENTER PROFESSIONALS. TO ASSIST BUSINESSES. I WILL STOP THEIR AND SEEK IT. HAPPENING IT QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE BUT- AT THIS POINT WE ARE I BELIEVE THE DATA SPECIFICS ON GEOGRAPHY. AND THE AWARDS BY INDUSTRY AS WELL AS A RATHER THE IMPACTED INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS WHO RECEIVED THE AWARD ARE ALL IN YOUR POCKET SO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT THERE BUT WE WILL HAVE MORE DATA TO SHARE AFTER ROUND TWO IS COMPLETE AND THE AWARDS HAVE GONE OUT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED- WITH- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DETAILS BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT. LET'S GO TO MISTER WEATHERFORD. SO WE PROVIDED A- WE PREPARED A HAND OUT ON THIS ISSUE BACK IN JANUARY AND- THE ARM THAT HAND OUT HIS- IS AVAILABLE ON- FROM A LINK ON THE COMMITTEE- THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR WEBSITE- I'M I'M NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH. ALL OF THE HANDOUT IT'S TEN PAGES LONG IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT- A PRODUCTION I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT TWO POINTS- FIRST. WHILE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS RELATED TO BE COOKED AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND VERY BROAD- AND- MANY INDUSTRIES HAVE SINCE RECOVERED. WE HAVE NOTED THAT THAT RECOVERY HAS BEEN VERY UNEVEN. DO AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED BY THE STATE. AND TO SOME EXTENT I'M STILL REQUIRED BY THE STATE AND BY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO CLOSE OUR DOORS. WERE THE MOST. IMPACTED AS WELL AND FROM MANY SERVICES BUSINESSES REQUIRE IN PERSON CONTACT- TOURISM ESPECIALLY WAS IMPACTED RIGHT- DETROIT AND MISS FIRST PERSON NOTED. THE SPEED AT WHICH THE CURRENT THE CURRENT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. BOB WAS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION THE TIME AND THE UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARDS TO WHAT ASSISTANCE MIGHT COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER- AS WE NOTED IN OUR- IN OUR HAND OUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- PROBLEMS THAT- THAT. THE BUSINESS APPLICANTS SEND AND NONPROFITS AND- AND THEIR PARTNERS- INDICATED TO US AND WE LISTED ON PAGE- I THINK PAID SIX PER HAND OUT. AND YOU KNOW- THE HURRIED EXECUTION LIKELY CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO MANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS- HOWEVER TO BE FAIR WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT. MANY NEW PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE SOME UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND SO TO SOME EXTENT THESE PROBLEMS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. SO ON PAGE SEVEN OF OUR HAND OUT WE DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO PARK IT THE MOST IMPACTED STATE HAS A FAR MORE LIMITED CAPACITY TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES THAN DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND GIVEN THOSE LIMITED STATE RESOURCES WE BELIEVE THAT. SHOULD GO OUT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES THAT SPECIFIC TARGETED TO THE BUSINESSES THAT WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC- OBVIOUSLY THE EXISTING PROGRAM IS IT'S QUITE TARGETED. BUT ON. UNDER THE PROGRAM THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH FUNDS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES AND- EVEN IF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IT. WOULD ROUGHLY DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT SIR. EVEN THEN WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE LIKELY MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE MOST AFFECTED AND IT IS THE NUMBER TO BE A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT. SO- THERE'S JUST STUNT THAT A LOT OF BUSINESSES WITH A NEED AND- LIMITED RESOURCES SO TARGETING SOME PARDON. HELLO WE NOTE THAT THE CURRENT GRANT PROGRAM- THOSE TARGET BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE- THE GRANTS WERE GOING THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED PRETTY EVENLY ACROSS THE STATE EVEN THOUGH DIFFERENT AREAS OF STATE WERE UNDER STRICTER- STATE HOME ORDERS FOR A LONGER PERIODOF TIME FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO THAT WASN'T. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- AS AN EXAMPLE OF WAYS THAT TURKEY MIGHT BE IMPROVED FROM. ON PAGE EIGHT NINE WE PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS REGARDING- CONSIDERATIONS FOR ON THE GRANT PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. IN LIGHT OF THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FEDERAL STIMULUS WHICH INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WE THINK IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE DEFER ACTION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UNTIL WE CAN BETTER EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THE FIRST PROGRAM AND THIS WORK FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND GET RECEIVED TODAY. WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT THE CURRENT PROGRAM WAS. CREATED FOR EXECUTIVE ACTION AND IS NOT ENACTED IN STATUTE. INTERIM THE WAYS MIGHT BE IMPROVED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TARGETED THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION TO. CLEARLY DEFINED THE AWARD CRITERIA AND STATUTES SPECIFY OVERSIGHT PROVISIONS AND IMPROVE DATA REPORTING. AND ANOTHER TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I- 1100% AGREE WITH YOUR WITH YOUR COMMENTARY. MISTER WHETHER FOR THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL FROM I'M SORRY NOT FOR THE PANEL FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR I ACTUALLY- WOULD LIKE TO START OFF JUST ONE MATURE WENT THROUGH OTHER WE WENT TO A THREE YES SO MANY SO MANY DIFFERENT PANELS I'M LOSING TRACK MY APOLOGIES- THIS THIS QUESTION I GUESS IS- MISS FARSI I HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT TABLE TO. A IN THE IN A FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WATCHING ONLINE- FOLLOWING ALONG AS TABLE TO THAT'S ON THE AGENDA SO THAT'S PAGE SEVENTEEN EARLIER YOU STATED THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS APPLICATIONS WERE RECEIVED THROUGH THE WEB IN OUR BUYERS OR THROUGH WEBINARS AND ONLINE TECHNOLOGY- AND YOU KNOW I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE SPEED OF THE PROGRAM RELEASE WAS ADEQUATE TIME PROVIDED TO DO OUTREACH TO UNDERSERVED GROUPS HOW MANY LANGUAGES WAS THE INFORMATION DECIMATED IN AND ASIDE FROM AN ONLINE PLATFORM WORDS THERE OR THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO APPLY. TO THE GROUNDS TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED IS THE IS ROUND TWO OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. AND HOW WERE THESE CHALLENGES ADDRESSED. AND FOLLOW UP WITH MY QUESTION ON TABLE TO. SURE SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SARA SORRY MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU GO THROUGH THOSE QUESTIONS AGAIN SO I CAN WRITE THEM DOWN I HAVE AND I DO HAVE ANSWERS FOR YOU I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT GETS EVERYTHING NO NO PROBLEM HAPPY TO BE HAPPY TO- REPEAT THEM. BECAUSE WE DO WANT WE DO WANT SOME ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WITH THE- THE SPEED THAT THE PROGRAM WAS RELEASED WAS ADEQUATE TIME PROVIDED TO DO OUTREACH TO UNDERSERVED GROUPS. HOW MANY LANGUAGES WAS THE INFORMATION DECIMATED IN AND ASIDE FROM THE ONLINE PLATFORM WERE THERE OTHER PER OVER THERE OTHER WAYS TO APPLY TO THE GRANTS- BROWN TO AS YOU MENTIONED STARTS TODAY. AND WORD UP OR ANY OF THESE CHALLENGES ADDRESSED. OKAY GREAT- SURE SO I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE SPEED OF RELEASE AND THE TIME TO REACH THE UNDERSERVED. THIS WAS. A HUGE REASON WHY WE ESTABLISH THE TO NETWORK OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED PARTNERS THESE ARE PARTNERS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH THESE UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR THE CDFI THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE MISSION BASED LENDERS THAT WORK WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE A SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. OF WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. NETWORK WHETHER THEY'RE SERVING WOMEN SMALL BUSINESSES. WE ARE BASICALLY PUSHED ALL THESE FOLKS OUT TO. ENSURE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTING WITH THEIR- TYPICAL NETWORK OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND MAKING THEM AWARE SO. THESE FIVE HUNDRED PARTNERS GRAY RAP AND REACH ACROSS THE STATE SO I'M I THINK THERE ARE AREAS WHERE WE CAN CERTAINLY AND WE ARE LOOKING AT. DOING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUTREACH MAYBE REACHING OUT TO SPECIFIC TRADE ASSOCIATIONS- BUT WE CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TARGETING MICRO BUSINESSES AS AN EXAMPLE THAT WOULD FIT UNDER THE CRITERIA OF THE SMALL BUSINESS IN THIS PROGRAM SO UNDER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OF REVENUES I'M ON THE LANGUAGES- WE HAD SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE SEVENTEEN NOT EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT THE TRAININGS WERE AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE OUR AGAIN OUR PARTNERS HAD. INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO SERVE COMMUNITIES THAT SPEAK AND THOSE. IN. THOSE LANGUAGES AND I BELIEVE IT IS EIGHTEEN. I S. YOUR LAST. REGARDING THE ONLINE PLATFORM AND WHETHER% TECHNOLOGY WAS AN ISSUE- WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A TECHNOLOGY GRANT GAP FOR SOME OF OUR GRANTEES ARE APOLOGIZE SOME OF THE BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE GRANTED THE APPLICANTS. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE OF SMALL BSINESS ADVOCATE WITHIN COPAYS IS GOING TO WORK ON- YOU KNOW ENHANCING AND FIGURING OUT HOW CAN WE MINIMIZE THAT TECHNOLOGY GAP FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND NOT JUST YOU KNOW FOR THE PURPOSES OF FILLING OUT THESE APPLICATIONS- SPECIFICALLY THIS GRANT APPLICATION FOR THE STATE BUT ALSO THE FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT- AS YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE PPP AND IDLE ARE ALSO NOW AVAILABLE AGAIN UNDER. THAT NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SO THESE ARE SOME GAPS THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING ON- I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS BE A IS NOT MY PROGRAM AND- SO I'M REALLY SPEAKING BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE BUT- EARLIER THIS YEAR. OUR DIRECTOR AS YOU MENTIONED AS THE BALL GOES MIND SPEND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME LAUNCHING A CAN'T GET DIGITAL CALIFORNIA PROGRAM SO WE CAN BRING SMALL BUSINESSES- YOU KNOW INTO THIS TECHNOLOGY AGE HELP SUPPORT THEM ON E. RETAIL- GET IN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN PARTICULAR SO YES WE DID IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE GAPS. IF THE BUSINESS COULD NOT APPLY THROUGH THE ONLINE PLATFORM OR HAD THOSE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AGAIN OUR PARTNERS WERE AVAILABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAYBE WALK THEM THROUGH IT AND SOME OTHER WAY- WHETHER WITH THROUGH THEIR PHONES OR- FIGURING OUT MAYBE A PUBLIC PLACE WHERE THEY COULD GO AND- ACCESS INTERNET SO THAT THEY COULD APPLY. WE CERTAINLY TRY TO MITIGATE ALL OF THOSE. CHALLENGES IN ANY WAY THAT WE COULD. IS THERE ARE FIVE. COMMUNITY BASED OR- THAT WERE PARTNER IN THIS I. CORRECT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA IN TERMS OF THE- WANT TO FILE PULL INFORMATION AND HOW MANY BUSINESSES WERE HELPED THROUGH THESE PARTNERS AND CAN YOU NAME LIKE YES I THINK. APOLOGIZE GO AHEAD I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU CAN NAME WITH SOME OF THOSE ORGANS LIKE THE TOP TEN OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS OR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. OH SURE OF COURSE I'M I. CAN FIND OUT IF WE HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS I BELIEVE THE LAST- DATA POINT THAT I'D SEEN WAS WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTACTS WITH BUSINESSES ON THE START OF THE LEAVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE PARTNERED WITH ARE THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE STATE'S SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM THESE ARE ALREADY STATE GRANTEES THAT ARE BEING FUNDED THROUGH- THE CALLOW S. B. H. TO DO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE GROUND. SO THIS INCLUDES SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS- WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE VARIOUS EFFORT THE PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS VETERANS BUSINESS HOURS THAT I KNOW ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO GET MAD AT ME BECAUSE I FORGOT- BUT WE HAVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIVE NETWORK THAT- THAT THE MODEL IS TYPICALLY THEY ARE HUBS WITH IN THE STATE THAT HAVE SORT OF A SPOKE- THAT W HAVE. EVERYWHERE IN YOUR DISTRICT AND IN THE ENTIRE COMMITTEES DISTRICT THERE IS SOME SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE AND THIS WAS OUR SECOND IS I'M IN GREAT PART AND THEN IN ADDITION ALL OF THEIR PARTNER. TO MANY GIVEN THE CDFI THE MISSION BASED LENDERS THERE WERE A MAJOR PART OF OUR NETWORK AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. I KNOW I'M LEAVING PEOPLE I'M REALLY SORRY. OTHER THAT'S REALLY HELP I GUESS. WHAT COMES UP AND ON BASE ON YOUR STAY AS- YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN OVER CONNECT TO STATE RESOURCES IN AN EFFORT TO BE CONNECTED TO ANY GRANTS. I'M NOT EXACTLY- AGAIN I DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY FOR EXAMPLE IS A GRANTEE OF OUR PROGRAM AT LEAST- THE CDFI ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE THEY'RE FEDERALLY REGULATED LENDERS THAT- AT LEAST FROM KOBE'S ARE CALLOW STA ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY FUNDING THEIR LENDERS- SO IN ADDITION TO OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK WE HAD MANY MANY OTHER PARTNERS THAT- BASICALLY WERE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THIS THIS WEB OF. OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY I GET THAT ALSO INCLUDES OF FOR EXAMPLE THE- NICK CHAMBERS THEY TELL ASIAN CHAMBER CALLOUS ATTIC CHAMBER- AND SO THESE ARE ALL PART OF THIS NETWORK TO DO OUTREACH WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES OR A JURISDICTIONS THANK YOU I KNOW- MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAS JOINED THEM AND ASK IF YOU COULD PLEASE GO ON MUTE AS HE'S WRESTLING ALL YOUR PAPERS MISTER CHIEF WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOU- IT IT'S JUST IT'S OUR OUR MODERN DAY COMMITTEES THAT THIS THIS IS THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- I WANT TO GO TO TABLE TO BE. BASED ON YOUR CURRENT STATEMENTS OF WORKING WITH THEM UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES AND ESPECIALLY THE ETHNIC CHAMBERS WHAT'S THE CROSSOVER DATA WHEN IT COMES TO MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES- RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LOW TO MODERATE- SMALL BUSINESSES AND VETERANS SO IT'S GREAT THAT YOU HAVE IT LINED UP BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MANY MINORITY WOMEN. A. SMALL BUSINESSES WERE HELPED. YOU MEAN THE OVERLAY. YES YES I'M- I DON'T HAVE THAT- AT LEAST OUT OF MY FINGERTIPS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON. GREAT WELL I BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT'S PART OF MY QUESTION ON HOW WE'RE CHALLENGES ADDRESSED SO IF THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE ARE GOING TO. BE MOVING FORWARD WITH NEXT STEPS FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE PROCESS IN WHICH- A SMALL MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHETHER IT'S- THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHAMBER OF THE HISPANIC CHAMBER THAT THE YOU KNOW CHAMBER API. AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN HAS ACCESS AND TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN A BIG. OBSTACLE IN A GETTING. IN ENSURING THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE SMALL BUSINESSES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES SO. NOT BEING ABLE TO POINT THAT OUT TO SPECIFICALLY- IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND- AGAIN I'LL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT AND WE CAN SEE ABOUT YOU KNOW AND IN FUTURE ROUNDS WITH IF THE- THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR COMMITTEE WOULD GRACIOUSLY- ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED. I'M A WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HOW WE CAN PARSE THAT OUT FURTHER BUT AGAIN TO REITERATE AND I KNOW I'M LEAVING FOLKS OUT BUT LIKE ONE BIG ORGANIZATION THAT I'VE LEFT OUT YOURS CAL NONPROFIT. THAT THEY WERE REALLY OUR ARMY INTO REACHING THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY ASIAN. CAMEO WHICH SERVES UP MICRO BUSINESSES- I KNOW I'M LEAVING OTHERS UP AMPAC. AGAIN WE TRIED OUR VERY BEST TO CAPTURE ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WE CAN'T PUT OUT COMMERCIALS- IT IS SO WE THINK THAT NETWORK REALLY HELPED. BRING TOGETHER THE INTENDED AUDIENCE OR AT LEAST WE HOPE WE GOT AS CLOSE TO BEING AS COMPREHENSIVE. AS POSSIBLE AND ALL THE CHAMBERS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE PART. OF THAT SO- YEAH. YES I WILL I BRING IT UP BECAUSE THE CHAMBER THAT ARE MEANT ALL SUBMIT A LETTER OF CONCERN IN TERMS F NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS A LOT OF THE INFORMATION OR GRANTS JUST BASED ON. AGAIN TECHNOLOGY ISSUES- TIMING RUSHING THROUGH A PROCESS IT CETERA SO I THINK THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT HOW DO WE FIX THAT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT. YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE UNDER INCREDIBLE PRESSURES TO MOVE THINGS QUICKLY BUT AS WE MOVE THINGS QUICKLY. THANKS ALSO FALL THROUGH THE CRACK IN MY TACKING ABOUT. THE-LIVELIHOODS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO PUT ALL OF THEIR HARD EARNED. DOLLARS AND BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS TO MAKE THEIR SMALL LITTLE BUSINESS WORK AND HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. AND THAT IT THAT IS A CONCERN TO ME BECAUSE IT IS SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE UP THE- THE IDENTITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE BEAUTY OF OUR STATE- ACTUALLY FUNCTION AND WORKING WHY PEOPLE WANT TO. WORK AND LIVE HERE- DO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE I HAVE SEVERAL BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE OPEN WE OPEN IT UP. BONTA YES MR TO. GREAT THANK YOU AND LET ME APOLOGIZE I HAD TAKEN MY SCREEN OFF BUT NOT THE MUTE SO STILL TRYING TO. NAVIGATE THE WEB ACTS SO- I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DECISION MAKING AROUND THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS AND APPRECIATE JUST. HOW HOW HOW MUCH DEMAND THERE IS- BUT GIVEN THAT ONLY 6% OF APPLICANTS FOR GRANTED FUNDING IN THE FIRST ROUND- WE'RE GETTING A TON OF QUESTIONS AND ALL OF OUR OFFICES WHEN IT COMES TO HOW APPLICANTS WERE SELECTED. SO WONDERING IF YOU COULD PROVIDE DATA ON- ON ON ON HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE- HOW THE APPLICATIONS WERE VETTED AND JUST THERE IS THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND TRANSPARENCY AND SORT OF LACK OF GUIDANCE BEING GIVEN BY L'INDUSTRIE ABOUT SUCCESSFUL VERSES ON SIXTY. MS EVERETT REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSTAND MORE HOW THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE GIVEN HOW FEW APPLICANTS WORK FOR WERE SELECTED. BUT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU SURE- I THINK IT'S SO SOME OF THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE SHARED WITH- COMMITTEE STOP I MEAN CERTAINLY- NEED. THE INTERMEDIARY WHEN THE STREET AWARDED THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS- THERE WAS EIGHT. I APOLOGIZE. THAT'S HOW WE AWARDED BLOOD MYSTERY SO WE LOOK AT VARIOUS CRITERIA- ON- YOU KNOW. BE ON THE TYPE OF BUSINESS- THAT- OH MY GOODNESS- LET ME JUST PULL UP MY NOTES SO I DON'T MISS SPEAK AGAIN I APOLOGIZE I AM STEPPING IN HERE- AND YOU KNOW I WE NOTE THAT- ALL OF YOU GUYS ALL THE LEGISLATURE DON'T GET A LOT OF INCOMING AND I HOPE YOUR STOCK WAS AWARE THAT WE GET A TRAINING FOR STAFF ON THIS. A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION IS ON THE GROUND WEBSITE- IN TERMS OF THE CRITERIA THAT WAS CONSIDERED. THERE WAS A BALANCING ACT THAT THE INTERMEDIATE. DEAD TO ISSUE THE GROUNDS AT THAT POINT. ON LOOKING AT THE BLUEPRINTS FOR THE STATE SEEING WHICH INDUSTRIES WERE HARDEST HIT. LOOKING AT THE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE LEAST ACCESS TO CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE MOST THAT NEED BECAUSE OF. THE THREAT AND THEN OF COURSE LOOKING AT YOUR GEOGRAPHY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- WE HAVE. PROVIDED SOME OF THIS AND WE- TRY TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE LANDING PAGE OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IT IT IT HAS BEEN IT'S BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND FOR OFFICES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND TO GET SME TRANSPARENCY ON THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE. FROM THE CHART THAT WE WERE PROVIDED IT LOOKS LIKE 60% OF FIRST FROM MONIES WENT TO QUOTE HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES SO THAT MEANT. 40% WENT TO NON HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES. CAN YOU TELL. SUCH A MAIN WHY. SO MUCH WANT TO APPLICANTS NOT IN HIGH PRIORITY TEARS. GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF. NOT HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES AT RECEIVING FUNDING THAT THAT THAT DID EXACTLY MAKE SENSE TO US. SURE I'M. I MAY HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU GUYS ON THIS I MEAN CERTAINLY THE INDUSTRIES THAT RECEIVED THE GRANT FUNDING WERE IMPACTED IN SOME WAY- IF YOU COULD GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO LOOK INTO MY NOTES HERE I WOULD APPRECIATE MORE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTERWARDS. WE CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE SECONDS WHATEVER THE INFORMATION THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU. I KNOW IT'S ME- ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU THAT'S RIPPLING THROUGH MY PAPER SAYS WELL. I'M OKAY I DO MY BEST TO TRY TO MEET A MINOR. IF I IF I MAY JUMP IN THE SYSTEM WHILE MARLA. INFORMATION YES I'M I MAJOR THAT IS JUMP IN. IN SO I THINK THE HIGH END IN. IS ACTUALLY A DOESN'T. FROM THE SMALL ADMINISTRATION FROM FEDERAL. THERE'S ACTUALLY NO INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA THAT WAS NOT IMPACTED- BY COVERT NINETEEN SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW GOT THE GOT THE OUTSTANDING- IT'S EVERY INDUSTRY THERE'S JUST A FEW THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS PARTICULARLY HIGHLY IMPACTED. I'M BECAUSE THEY TENDED TO BE THE ONES THAT WERE FIVE PEOPLE FACING FORWARD FACING INDUSTRY. THAT WERE- YOU KNOW THAT FACED MORE OF THAT FIVE. PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES- INCLUDING PERSONAL CARE SERVICES HI CHILD CARE SERVICES AND RETAIL CLOTHING SECTOR. AND SO ON LOOK IT DEFINITELY GET YOU MORE INFORMATION BUT THAT'S- OUT IN YOU KNOW SO REALLY IT'S EVERY INDUSTRY I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE IMPACTED. SO THIS WAS JUST. A DESIGNATION MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO YES TO JUMP IN MADAM CHAIR MR. XU NEED IF BUSINESSES ALL THE GRANT WENT TO EITHER AND- IN. IN THE- OR UP UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES SO IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER AND SO THERE IS AN OVERLAP HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE OVERLAY IS. AND YES WHAT SOME JETER SAID IS CORRECT WITNESS NATURE SAYS CORRECT THAT. THAT DEFINITION A FEDERAL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DO YOU DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. ADD ME TO MYSELF- SO WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS WE WERE ALL SUPER EXCITED WHEN THE GROUP CAME OUT WE ALL DID A LOT OF WORK TO GET IT OUT AND- YOU KNOW. THE SUCH A FEW PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY GOT MONEY THAT NOW WE'RE EXPERIENCING- THE FRUSTRATIONS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND LITERALLY 'M GETTING EMAILS ABOUT WHY SHOULD I EVEN BOTHER TO APPLY- WHEN THERE'S JUST SO LITTLE MONEY SO A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS ONE. YOU KNOW. GIVEN THAT THE CALIFORNIA CORRECT BELIEVE WAS SO OVERSUBSCRIBED I'M WONDERING IF THE MINISTRATION WOULD SUPPORT MUCH HIGHER A HIGHER NUMBER RATHER THAN FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION- BUT SECONDLY I KNOW THAT THE SECOND ROUND APPLICATION WINDOW JUST OPENED TODAY. WONDERING IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO CHANGE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THIS ROUND. AND ALSO IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO AUTOMATICALLY CARRY OVER REJECTED APPLICANTS FROM THE FIRST WINDOW INTO THE SECOND WINDOW WORK AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS LIKE WHY BOTHER IRISHMAN MY APPLICATION. CAN YOU JUST KEEP THAT APPLICATION HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO DEAL WITH. THAT THAT. WITH THE FOR. BUT CERTAINLY I CAN I CAN RISK YOUR SET QUESTION A NIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF. I WILL HAVE TO WAIT ON. BALLOT QUESTION. BUT YES THE PROCESS DOES- WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE WORKED OUT IS ANYBODY THAT WAS NOT AWARDED IN THE FIRST ROUND IS AUTOMATICALLY ROLLED OVER TO THE SECOND ROUND. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL- UP LEFT FOR WORK ON THEIR PART- AND YOU KNOW. WE HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW IN IN THE GROUND AT YOU KNOW THE THOSE TEMPERATURES. ISSUES THE SPOT YOU RISK WILL. MUCH MINIMAL BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAUGHT A LOT OF THE SMALL BIZ. AND NOT FIRST GO OR SO FOLKS ARE ALREADY IN IN POPULATED INTO THIS- SOME G. DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THE MORE MONEY QUESTION AND- ANSWERS. BOB. IF YOU ARE REPLY. I'M SO SORRY THAT I THOUGHT I WAS THINKING I WAS ON MY POLICY. GEN I'M I WOULD WITH THE FINANCE WOULD DEFINITELY ADAM BE OPEN TO THIS. FURTHER FUNDING OUR ADMINISTRATOR AND FINANCE ARE FROM TO SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS SO. WE WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU. FOR ABOUT IT. OKAY AND THEN WHAT I'M SORRY JUST I APOLOGIZE ASSEMBLY JUST TO BE VERY THOUGH I DO THE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE ROLLED OVER ALLEGED CRITERIA NOT CHANGE EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME SO IT'S AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FROM ROUND ONE TO ROUND TWO. OKAY SO I APPRECIATE% THAT I THINK GIVEN HOW MUCH CONFUSION THERE HAS BEEN OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY. FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR- I THINK MORE CLARITY I WOULD BE HELPFUL NOT SO JUST SAY THAT- I DO HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AROUND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND GIVEN THAT I HAVE. MANY MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS IN MY CITY SAN FRANCISCO- YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A CARVE OUT OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WANT TO JUST MENTION YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THAT THEIR ESTIMATES THAT. OUR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE LOSING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A DAY IN A BEEN DOING SO SINCE MARCH SO THIS IS SORT OF DROP IN THE BUCKET. AND I HAD A- SEPIC ARE I THE MINISTRATIONS FOR PER BELOW TO SEE ORGANIZATION AND WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DEFINE THAT AND WHAT YOU'RE WORKING DEFINITION IS FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT KIND OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEING GRANTED THERE AND THEN A SEPARATE QUESTION IS- I KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET ALLOWED INDOOR MUSEUMS AT ANY SIZE TO OPEN UP EVEN AT A LIMITED CAPACITY IN PURPLE TIER COUNTIES BUT HAS ALLOWED MALLS AND OTHER NONESSENTIAL RETAIL TO DO IT. ON THEIR BATTLE BONTA LEGISLATORS INCLUDING MYSELF THAT I'VE ASKED FOR A RATIONALE AROUND THAT DECISION AND WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME FEEDBACK ON WHY THAT DECISION HAS WE WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME ANSWERS ON BEHALF OF OUR- CULTURAL INSTITUTION CONSTITUENTS. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WILL CERTAINLY- MAKE SURE THE RIGHT ENTITIES FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT QUESTION ABOUT THAT THAT THE SEVERITY THAT YOU IDENTIFIED. IN TERMS OF THE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE STILL. MONNING N. ON AN ADEQUATE DEFINITION THERE AND- AGREED THERE'S A GREAT AMOUNT OF NEED THERE AND WE DO KNOW THAT THE PPP AND IDLE AGAIN ARE OPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TWO AND BUT- WE- INTEND TO CONTINUE HAVING THIS PROGRAM REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR. THOSE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. MORE SPECIFICITY TO BE DETERMINED- TO BE FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WITH GROSS REVENUES BELOW TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. TWO POINT FIVE DOLLARS THAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF SMALL THAT HAS BEEN THE CAP FOR THE PROGRAM YES. OKAY I'LL. I'LL JUST MINUTES AND AS YOU AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY CULTURE SITUATION THAT ARE ON LIKE TO NOW MANY OF THEM ARE MUCH LAW SO. THE NUMBER OF WHO AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR AND OF ITS TO THAT AT RISK. PERMANENT CLOSURE VERY VERY DIRE- A PRE YOUR ANSWER I GET THAT WERE WERE ON A VERY DIFFICULT SPOTTED I FOR ONE WOULD SUPPORT MORE FUNDING GENERALLY IN THIS AREA AND MORE CLARITY ON EXACTLY WHO CAN APPLY TARGETING THE RESOURCES TO FOLKS THAT MOST AS WE NEED THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SMALLBUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY FINE TUNE THAT. UP MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU- ON THE ON THE TOPIC OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND A COMMENT BY MISS FARSI SAYING THAT THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO. MAINTAIN AND STILL BE THE SAME. I FIND THAT TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNING IN TERMS OF THERE IS LITTLE. THERE'S LIMITED DETAIL AND OVERSIGHT THERE'S LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE. IT IS HARD TO CONSIDER- MOVING FORWARD WITH MORE FUNDING WHEN WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY DETAILS TO ENSURE THAT. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GETTING- FERCH- CHANCE IN TERMS OF. BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE- ACCESS TO GRANTS AND FUNDING. ONE OF THE LARGEST IMPACTED. BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE AND REALLY ACROSS THE NATION HAVE BEEN OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS MANY OF WHOM ARE. MINORITY OWNED MANY OF WHOM- DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS FUNDS MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT PART OF A LARGER ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAVE. ADVOCATED FOR THEM OR- DON'T KNOW WHERE OR HOW TO GO TO ACCESS FUNDS- IT IS MY BELIEF THAT I AM YOU KNOW. FULL DISCLOSURE I'M I LOVE I'M A BIG FOODIE PERSON I LOVE. SMALL RESTAURANTS I LOVE. THE NEIGHBORHOOD FEEL OF SMALL RESTAURANTS- AND I'M VERY CONCERNED. THAT IN TABLE THREE- ONLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY NINE. RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY RECEIVED. A FUNDING THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT. AND I'M CURIOUS IF THERE HAS BEEN CONVERSATIONS ON HOW TO SAVE. OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS IN OUR STATE. AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF BEING. ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FUTURE FUNDS ESPECIALLY AROUND TOO OR ANYTHING MOVING FORWARD. AS FAR AS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I WOULD WELCOME OF FINANCE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS TOO I THINK SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY TRIED TO. THINK ABOUT ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS WE CAN HELP SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION TO THIS GRANT PROGRAM- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FIND OUR AND I THINK AS A SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER AND A DISASTER RELIEF. LOAN PROGRAM- OUR SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK. WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER IS REALLY NEAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIS GRANT PROGRAM HAS CREATED AN AVENUE. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE A RESOURCE AND HELP IDENTIFY WHAT THE FUNDING FOR- ANY OTHER KIND OF TOOLS ARE THAT ARE ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE SO WHETHER IT'S LOANS OR LOCAL GROUND SOMETIMES PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE STEPPED UP IN THE SPACE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO KEEP. OUR RESTAURANTS A FLAW IN THE STATE- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE SITUATION IS DIRE- BUT YOU KNOW WITH LIMITED FUNDING I THINK. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE. HE ALWAYS WE'RE DOING BEST HERE WE REALLY THINK THAT THE AT THE FIVE HUNDRED SAN FIVE MILLION WILL AT LEAST GO A BIT. AND HOW. THESE BUSINESS. AND- AND WILL TRYING TO THEM THE OTHER RESOURCE THAT WE AND THE MESSAGE OUT THERE. THANK YOU I AND I APPRECIATE THAT- AGAIN I WOULD DO ASK. THERE IS TO EVEN A YOUR CHART VERY IN. ON D. OF WHERE THE FUNDING HAS GONE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE RESTAURANTS OF THE ONLY TWO THOUSAND RESTAURANTS. THAT WERE AWARDED HOW MANY OF THEM ARE MINORITY OWNED HOW MANY OF THEM ARE WOMEN OWN HOW MANY OF THEM BELONG AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND ARE THEY RECEIVING. A THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING NECESSARY SO IF YOU CAN. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AT SOME POINT I THINK THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND ANY EFFORT TO MOVE- ADDITIONAL FUNDING. CAN YOU CLARIFY SOMETHING FOR ME PLEASE. DID L'INDUSTRIE SEND OUT AN EMAIL TO THE FIRST ROUND OF APPLICANTS WHO WERE NOT AWARDED GRANTS- INDICATING THAT THEY AUTOMATICALLY- WE'RE PART OF ROUND TWO. AT YES. THIS IS INDEED A- CHAIR AT SO L'INDUSTRIE I DID CONTACT ALL THE APPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO BE AUTOMATICALLY MOVED INTO ROUND TWO- I BELIEVE THEY WERE CONTACTED BY EMAIL- ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH. AND THE SECOND ROUND STARTS TODAY AND IT'S GOING TO CLOSE ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH. AT AND WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON ONCE THIS FIRST OUT AND FIRST AND SECOND ROUNDS. ARE COMPLETED AS FAR AS OUR INITIAL DATA IS TELLING US- WELL WE KNOW THERE'S STILL SUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. ARE WE ARE AT. THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS HAS REACHED THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS AND- I'M YOU KNOW I AM ALSO A FAN OF SMALL RESTAURANTS AND I THINK A LOT OF THOSE. HAD BEEN ABLE TO PICK IT A LITTLE BIT TO OUTDOOR DINING- ROOM. AND A TAKE OUT. AND SO IN TERMS OF- HOW MUCH THEY WERE IMPACTED ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL IMPACTED THERE'S PROBABLY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. I ONE EIGHT AM APPLIED FOR THE FUNDING THAT- INDICATED THAT GREATER NEED. SO AM I WILL DEFINITELY TRY TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECIPIENTS AND MADAM CHAIR ABOUT- ALL THE- OVERLAPPING. CATEGORIES THANK YOU AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THE INTO RECIPIENTS ARE FOR WORD FOR DATA. I'M SORRY THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU KNOW- IF INTENDED RECIPIENTS ARE AWAITING ANY DATA. ARE AWAITING. WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM OR ABOUT THE PROGRAM YES- IF THEY NEED MORE INFORMATION ON MOVING FORWARD R. S. THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY MOVED FORWARD SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE AT THIS POINT GOT IT OKAY WELL AGAIN THE INFORMATION AND DATA WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHO'S ACTUALLY RECEIVING A FUNDING PART OF THE QUESTION ON THE RESTAURANTS HAS BEEN THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ON- OBVIOUSLY- WHETHER THEY CAN OPERATE WHETHER THEY CAN DO INDOOR OUTDOOR DINING AT CETERA. THE FOOD GOING GOING TO WASTE AND- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE. THEY RECEIVE AT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND NOT SHUT DOWN. I THINK PART OF IT IS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THIS PROGRAM WAS SCALED UP RELATIVELY QUICKLY- I DECEMBER THIRTIETH SO WE WERE OPERATING. INCREDIBLY FAST TIME- BECAUSE OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED NEED SOME HOPING THAT ONCE BROWN TO CLOSES. I WILL BE ABLE TO BE IN THE- GET SOME MARGINAL. TO SUPPORT THE NEED FOR EVEN MORE ACTORS OFTEN. IN HOPEFULLY FOR AROUND. RIGHT AND I A- YOU SAYING THAT AND HOW. HAVING A WRECK OF THAT I WAS A MY QUESTION EARLY ON IN TERMS OF HOW HAS THE SPEED OF THE ROLLOUT OF THE PROGRAM IMPACTED. ON THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO REACH- THE BUSINESS SMALL BUSINESS IS NECESSARY AND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES. THAT WE NEED TO FACE AND ALSO. OUR FIND SOLUTIONS FOR SO THAT IN ROUND TWO AND ANYTHING MOVING FORWARD WE ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO BE GREAT. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR ANYBODY ONLINE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO. THE NEXT PANEL. SEEING NONE. OKAY LET ME GET MYSELF- SITUATED HERE WE ARE GOING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. WHICH IS A SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT PROPOSALS JOINING US ON THIS PANEL IS- MISTER G. CHAMBERLAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SCOTT DISICK WITH WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF GOLD IS BRIAN WHETHER FORD WHO IS A SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE LET'S BEGIN THE SESSION. AND THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR- TO THE J. CAME AGAIN ARCA FINANCE- SO FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. I DID INCENTIVIZE BUSINESS BUSINESS. TO LOCATE IN CALIFORNIA OR TO STAY GROW AND CREATE QUALITY. FULL TIME JOBS IN THE STATE. CONCEPTION WE GO OFF OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR GROUP IS AWARDED NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED BUSINESSES. CREDITS OF- CREDIT OVER ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS. IN EXCHANGE FOR A COMMITMENT FOR THESE BUSINESSES TO CREATE A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NEW FULL TIME JOBS. AND TO MAKE OVER TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE. THE TOTAL CREDIT AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IS CAPPED AT A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS PLUS ANY UNALLOCATED. I REQUEST RECAPTURED CREDITS IN THE PRIOR YEARS. THE COMPETITIVE ALLOCATION OF THESE CREDITS IS BASED ON TWELVE DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME JOBS CREATED AND A WHETHER THE JOBS ARE AT RISK OF BEING CREATED IN ANOTHER STATE. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAM IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS REALLY THREE DIFFERENT OUT. AUGMENTATIONS OF THE PROGRAM. THE FIRST IS A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION OF THE CREDIT ALLOCATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. MINISTRATIONS SPEAKING ABOUT EARLIER EARLY LEGISLATIVE ACTION OFF ON THE SIDE OF. THE SECOND ITEM IS. A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION OF ACRYLIC CASE FOR THE- TO THE EAST AUGMENT OF THE EXIST TAX CREDITS. ARE VERY MUCH INTENDED TO HELP. AND WE'RE YOU CAN. MICHAEL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CREATE JOBS EMERGED. WITH TO CREATE THOSE AND- IN SO DOING THE EXPAND INTO LOCAL AREAS WHICH THE NEW JOBS ARE CREATED. WILL HELP ALL BUSINESSES THE AREA INCLUDING THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN HURT BY THE PANDEMIC. THE EARLY ACTION ON THE ON THE FIRST ITEM ON THE ON THE CURRENT YEAR ALLOCATIONS IS NEEDED. SO THAT THE ADDITIONAL CREDITS CAN BE ALLOCATED IN THE FINAL CREDIT ROUND FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. WELL TURNED OUT TO BE THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS WHOLE WHOLE. AND THAT IS EIGHT ONE TIME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHICH IS RUN THROUGH THE CAL COMPETES PROGRAM. SO- AND THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LOOK AT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE EARLY ACTION. OF THIS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING WILL ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM COME PUBLIC WITH WITHIN THE CAL COMPETES PROGRAM. IT WILL HAVE A SUPPORTER SELECTION CRITERIA OR SHOT SELECTION PROCESS THAT THE- BUT THE REGULAR CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HOUSE BUT IT WILL HAVE A MORE TARGETED FOCUSED. AT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A GRANT BUSINESSES WILL NEED TO MEET ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA. UP TO ESTABLISH AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NET NEW JOBS. MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN THE STATE. IT TOO HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS OF THE STATE. OR TO RECEIVE A DESIGNATION FROM THE DIRECTOR OF GOBIZ. AT THE APPLICATION IS A STRATEGIC PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. TO STOP PUSHING THE GRANT COMPONENT IN WITH INTEL COMPUTE WILL EXPAND THE POOL BUSINESSES THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM SO THERE THERE'S A POPULATION BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW THAT THEY REALLY HAVE NO OF. THE PARTICIPATING CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BENEFIT FROM THE TAX CREDIT. SO PROTECT THE BUSINESS THREE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE GRASS AS OPPOSED TO THE TAX CREDITS. SO FIRST THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT CONTINUOUSLY REINVEST PROFITS INTO THEIR BUSINESS- THOSE GENERATING EITHER SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS TOWARD NOT OPERATING LOSSES. RESULTING IN LITTLE TO NO TAX LIABILITY A SECOND WE HAVE SMALLER BUSINESSES THAT WITH RELATIVELY LOW LOW INCOME TAX LIABILITY. AND THIRD THERE ARE START UPS WITH WHAT DID HAPPEN. IT WOULD HAVE LITTLE OR NO TAX LIABILITY. KALKAJI CRAP IS IN THE DAY INCENTIVE- THAT THAT THE STATE CAN OFFER FOR BUSINESSES WE'RE CONDUCTING A MULTISTATE SITE SELECTION ANALYSIS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. AND IT IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE APPLICANT POOL. OF THE OUTPUT OF THE CAL COMPUTER CONTROL IN TERMS OF JOB CREATION. AND FINALLY THE NEW PROGRAM WILL DEDICATE AT LEAST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS OF THE STATE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS ON CALPERS. OF SURE WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I THAT I GO IN AND PRESENT THE SECOND TAX CREDIT AS WELL. WHY DON'T WE- ACTUALLY YES WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND THEN WE'LL GO WITH THE REST OF THE PANELISTS PLEASE PLEASE CONTINUE. OKAY THANK YOU SO- THE PROPOSAL IS AN EXPANSION OF THE MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESS HIRING CREDIT TO READ AS- HIS HERRIMAN. I MENTIONED IT EARLIER PANEL SB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN WAS ADOPTED AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR AND HE CREATED THE MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESS TAX HIRING CREDIT. THE CREDIT IS AIMED AT HIRING AT HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WHO'VE BEEN HURT BY THE PANDEMIC AND ENCOURAGES BUSINESSES TO HIRE EMPLOYEES IN THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY. IT WAS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT WHICH WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE COMBAT CARE ACT ASPIRIN. THIS THIS MAIN STREET CREDIT IS EQUAL TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES HIRED BETWEEN. JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND DECEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYERS. A QUALIFIED EMPLOYER IS EMPLOYER WHO HAD. EACH TO GREATER ONE THEY HAD TO HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR FEWER AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND HAVE GROCERY SEATS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WERE 50% FOR THE LAST NUMBER GROCERY SEATS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THEY HAD TO BE A RELATIVELY SMALL BUSINESS AND THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY. NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THE CREDIT WAS ALLOCATED AND CAPPED AT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE RESERVATION PERIOD. HOWEVER THAT CREDIT HAS ENDED AND ONLY ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION OF THE HUNDRED MILLION IN CREDITS WERE RESERVED. FOR THE MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO EXPAND CREDIT. IN IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO IT DID THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT AND AT THE END OF. INDIAN DECEMBER LAST YEAR. WE DON'T YET HAVE A DETAILED PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO THE PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL POLL PROPOSAL THAT WE WANT TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD. OF THAT THAT BUSINESSES CAN HIRE EMPLOYEES AND QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT WE WANT TO AND WE WANT TO LOOSEN UP SOME THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA TO THE MORE BUSINESSES CAN. JUST FADE- AND ALSO WE WANT TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF TAXPAYERS TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT. SO THE ALLOCATED- CREDIT AMOUNT FOR THIS NEXT ROUND OF A HUNDRED MILLION PLUS. THE AMOUNT THAT'S LEFT OVER ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION. FROM THE- FROM THE FIRST ROUND OF CRAFTS. IF INTEREST PAID TO THE RESERVATION PERIOD FOR THE CREDITS WILL BE. WILL BE HERE WITHIN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE EXPANSION OF THIS CREDIT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FIRMS WHO WERE HURT BY THE PANDEMIC AND TO ENCOURAGE. THOSE FIRMS TO HIRE NEW WORKERS. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY TIME. ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAMBERLAIN I KNOW THAT- WE CAN PROBABLY TALK FOR HOURS IN TERMS OF THE DETAILS OF THE TO. TAX TAX PROPOSALS BUT LET LET'S TURN IT OVER TO MR DOES SECOND MISTER WEATHERFORD FOR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THANK BAKER BAKER CHECKER YEAH MY NAME IS SCOTT DOT SECOND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AT COPAYS. AND AS I THINK MR JOMMELLI DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB DESCRIBING THE KALKAJI PROPOSAL AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER WEATHERFORD. YES SO- WE PREPARED A REPORT OF A MAJOR ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR BUSINESS TAX PROPOSALS- AND SO ON YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH THE ENTIRE- REPORT BUT NOTEDTHAT LINK TO THAT REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON. THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE- I'M GONNA START FIRST WITH THE MAIN STREET HIRING CREDIT SO- I THINK J. COVERED ALL THE IMPORTANT POINTS WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S RELATIVELY WELL TARGETED TO THE BUSINESSES THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IT WAS LIMITED TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED DECLINE OF THE REVENUES AND ITS ELIGIBILITY IS LIMITED TO THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED. NOW THIS DESIGN DOES LEAVE OUT SOME TYPES OF BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE NEWLY FORMED BUSINESSES THAT MAYBE- UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A DECLINE IN THE REVENUE- OR THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED OR NOT AND- AND ONE OF THE IMPACT AND DISTRICTS- THE INITIAL CREDIT LAST YEAR THAT WITH THE DOCTOR MASTERS BUT IT WAS NOT FULLY- BUT NOT FULLY USED AND IS. A MISTER CHAMBERLAIN NOTED THEY'RE RECOMMENDING- THE THIRD THIRD THERE- THEY'RE IN FAVOR OF MOVING. ROLLING OVER THAT UNUSED PORTION TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT- FROM ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND- WE THOUGHT THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE ON THE FUNDING NEEDS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WE ARMS SUGGEST TWO WAYS- WE THINK THIS PROGRAM AT HAS MERIT AND WE SUGGEST- PERHAPS- REDIRECTING FUNDS FROM OTHER- PROGRAMS THAT ARE LESS WELL TARGETED TOWARDS- TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM- IN ADDITION- WE THINK THERE'S OTHER WAYS THE PROGRAM COULD BE EXPANDED. YOU COULD BROADEN THE ELIGIBILITY TO OTHER PERIODS DURING WHICH BUSINESSES HAD A DECLINE IN REVENUE WERE TO OTHER INDUSTRIES WERE AFFECTED. AND YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT TO MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE. NOW ALL OF THEM ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA KEEPS EXPANSION- AND THE- THE NEW CALIFORNIA COMPETES GRANT PROGRAM. SO DISTANCE WITH BACKGROUND THE OBJECTIVEOF COMPORT CALIFORNIA COMPETES TO ATTRACT RETAIN AND GROWING BUSINESSES HERE IT IS A TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO COMPANIES- THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE. RECEIVED CALIFORNIA COMPETES AWARDS THERE PRIMARILY IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS MANUFACTURING. PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERVICES AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE PANDEMIC HAPPENED BROAD FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE. INDUSTRIES THAT HAD THE LARGEST- THE LARGEST DECLINES IN REVENUE THE LARGEST- DECLINES IN THE EMPLOYMENT THOSE WERE NOT IN THESE INDUSTRIES IN THESE INDUSTRIES IN PARTICULAR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PERFORMED VERY WELL DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROPOSALS FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST THIS PROGRAM IS NOT A SUITABLE VEHICLE FOR ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. ADDRESS THOSE ARE TARGET THOSE HARDEST HIT INDUSTRY. SECOND THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS THE URGENCY- THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION REQUIRES BECAUSE IT'S PROGRAM INSTRUCTION OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND WHILE THE GRANT PROPOSAL DOES RESPOND TO THIS TIMING ISSUE TO SOME EXTENT IT DOES READ OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN PARTICULAR. I SHOULD THE STATE MAKE A SIGNIFICANT SHIPMENTS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AT THIS TIME. AND ALSO SINCE THE ARM THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING TO AWARD GRANTS BEFORE BUSINESSES MEET THEIR- HIRING AND INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS- LIKE WE DO WITH THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. HOW WILL THE STATE MANAGED INCREASED RISKS OF- PROVIDING THOSE GRANTS TO COMPANIES THAT MAY. I'M NOT IN THE AND MEET THEIR HIRING AND INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS. SO WE ARE- RECOMMENDING THAT YOU REDIRECT THAT FUNDING TO OTHER- OTHER PURPOSES. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER WEATHERFORD- TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY I HAVE MORE COMMENT THAN IDEAL QUESTION I COULDN'T DISAGREE WITH- MISTER WEATHERFORD MORE. AS IT RELATES TO- KHALKHA PEACH- TAX CREDIT. FIRST OF ALL- A CRITICAL INDUSTRY WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY JEOPARDIZED IF NOT ALLOWED TO ACCESS THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT. WOULD BE AEROSPACE. CURRENTLY AEROSPACE GENERATES ELEVEN BILLION WITH A B. AND WAGES AND BENEFITS TO THE STATE. SEVEN BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE AND AVIATION DEFENSE INDUSTRY SUPPORTS FIVE HUNDRED AND. ELEVEN THOUSAND HIGH PAYING JOBS THAT'S HALF A MILLION PEOPLE- L. SPACE IS A HUGE IN MY PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND THE JOBS ASSOCIATED WITH THERE ARE SPACE OF THE LIFE BLOOD OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS BUT THE STATE HAS A RETAINING GROWING JOBS AND AEROSPACE CURRENTLY. CALIFORNIA RANKS TENTH AND OUR SPACE TO TRACK TO MISS AND THEY ARE LOOKING ELSEWHERE AND IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN- THIS THIS INDUSTRY WE LOSE ALL THOSE BENEFITS AND I JUST OUTLINED. SO THIS THIS FUNDING WITHOUT THIS FUNDING WE RUN THE RISK OF LOSING- TO THESE OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA AND TEXAS WHICH IS ALREADY STARTING TO SIPHON OFF SOME OF THESE JOBS. SO I WANT TO EMPHATICALLY EXPRESSED MY SUPPORT FOR THE CALVET BEACH PROGRAM- THAT'S THAT'S MAINTAINED IN THIS A BUDGET INCREASE. THANK YOU MISTER LIKE. AT MISTER CHIP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I THINK I WILL PROBABLY PROVIDED A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT WAS JUST- ARTICULATED BY BUYER GOOD COLLEAGUE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. SO- I WAS VERY EXCITED TO READ ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT SO I SAY THAT AS A SOMEONE WHO USED TO RUN A SMALL BUSINESS WHO. SERVED AS A SMALL BUSINESS COMMISSIONER IN MY CITY- I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT BEING SAID I HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT AN EXPANSION OF THE CAL COMPETES PROGRAM. AS IT'S CURRENTLY BEING SUGGESTED AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE I HEARD FROM THE L. A. L. SO IF I THINK FRANKLY ONE OF THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR CAL COMPETES. IS THAT A COMPANY PROPOSES TO CREATE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS. AND WE NEED LARGE COMPANIES ABSOLUTELY BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- WE HAVE SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE- ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXTENSION AT THIS POINT AND I AND I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO FOCUS ARE. VERY SCARCE RESOURCES ON HELPING THOSE PARTICULAR BUSINESSES AND- AS I UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL CORRECTLY DOESN'T SEEM AS IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO DEMONSTRATE PANDEMIC IMPACT TO RECEIVED A CAL COMPETES GRANT. AND YOU KNOW I KNOW. MANY OF THE LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED CAL COMPETES- CREDITS IN THE PAST- ARE ARE DESERVING- BUT- BUT- MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY DOING. FINE AT THIS MOMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE. THAT ARE IN TROUBLE SO- I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I HEARD THE L. A. O. PERSPECTIVE I REALLY. FROM Y PERSPECTIVE I FEEL LIKE IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEND SCARCE RESOURCES WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE SMALLER BUSINESSES. THAT ARE ARE AT RISK. WHICH LEADS ME TO A SECOND POINT. YOU KNOW I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CREATING DIFFERENT GRANT FUNDING POTS WE'VE GOT- MAINSTREET TAX CREDIT WE'VE GOT CAL COMPETES WITH GOT THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANTS- IT'S COMPLICATED. IT'S NOT SIMPLE- IT'S CREATING AN AWFUL LOT OF BUREAUCRACY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO NAVIGATE. SOME BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHY THEY FEEL THAT THERE'S A NECESSITY TO CREATE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS. RATHER THAN TRYING TO SIMPLIFY IT INTO A PROGRAM THAT IS FOCUSED ON- ON SMALL BIZ ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON SMALL BUSINESSES. AND BEEN REALLY TRYING TO TRY TO KEEP THOSE BUSINESSES FROM FROM GOING UNDER I. WONDERED IF I COULD- GET SOME THOUGHTS ON ON WHY WE HAVE TO- I THINK AT THIS POINT TALK ABOUT AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE PROGRAM'S. ALLEGEDLY TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES ALTHOUGH AS I SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK CAL COMPETES IS ACTUALLY DOING THAT- IF THE REQUIREMENT. REQUIRES FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU- SO. OUR FIRST AYE AYE WELL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE IS HOW THIS WORKS FOR THE FIVE JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FIVE HUNDRED. EMPLOYEE TEST FOR CAL COMPETES. IN ONE OF SEVERAL SO ARE IT'S IN HERE THAT ARE- EITHER OR CAST SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEET THAT ONE. I CERTAINLY IF YOU BE ONE OF THE OTHER FOUR SO- BUT I WILL I WILL GRANT YOU THAT THAT CAL COMPETES IS NOT. GEARED TOWARDS- IT- IN THERE USED TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS CARVE OUT IN THE IN THE CAL COMPLETES PROGRAM BUT- THE L. A. U. ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO CHIEF JUSTICE WELL THERE THEY SUGGESTED THAT A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE- CREDIT SUISSE GROUP GIVEN UNDER CAL COMPETES. WE'RE GOING TO BUSINESSES THERE WERE CENTURY JUST COMPETING AGAINST OTHER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. AND WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE CAL COMPETES OF FOCUS IS MONEY ON SMALL BUSINESSES THE TEND TO BE THOSE BUSINESSES. THAT ARE NOT- YOU KNOW. CONSIDERING MOVING OUT OF STATE BUT THEY ARE THEY'RE JUST. MOVING AND IT JUST JUST DECIDING HOW BIG TO GROW THEIR FIRM AND THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER OTHER CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES. SO THE DECISION WAS MADE. BY THE LEGISLATURE A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO. TO REMOVE THAT SMALL BUSINESS CARVE OUT SO THAT- SO THAT THE E. D. R. HOW COMPETES COMMITTEE COULD FOCUS ON THOSE JOBS THAT WERE MOST AT RISK OF NOT BEING CREATED IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S REALLY AYE AYE I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THIS IS NOT GEARED SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT IT'S REALLY GEARED TOWARDS KEEPING THE ECONOMY GOING AND SPEND AND STIMULATING ADDITIONAL GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY SO- BUT THAT'S MY RESPONSE- AND MAYBE MISTER DARCY BECAUSE WHO DISAPPOINTED BUT I- I WONDER SECOND QUESTION ON ON THE DIFFERENT FUNDING PARKSIDE. I THINK I WOULD I WOULD GO BACK TO- THE D. THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS THAT IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT ARE AFFECTED. ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND SO BUT THAT IS A PART OF THEIR THAT THE FOR CAL COMPETE. I'M REALLY LOOKING T- AT THAT. URGING FIRMS TO CREATE JOBS WITH IN CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN CREATED ELSEWHERE. AND I WILL HELP YOU. IT IF I CAN SO I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK YOU HAVE HONESTLY LAID OUT WHAT CAL COMPETES IS ABOUT WHAT I'M REACTING TO IS THE FACT THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET SUGGESTED THAT SMALL BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS WOULD PARTICULARLY BENEFIT. THROUGH THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR CAP KEEPS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAL COMPETES IN THE CONTEXT OF SMALL BUSINESS TAX RATE OF PROPOSALS LET'S NOT HAVE ANY ILLUSION THAT CAL COMPETES. IS ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S NOT IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP. TRYING TO HELP LARGE COMPANIES FROM- TO HELP THEM BE COMPETITIVE BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE CAL COMPETES PROGRAM AS YOU WELL KNOW- HAS PROVIDED TAX RATES TO TESLA. TO NBCUNIVERSAL THIS TO TWO OTHER LARGER COMPANIES AND THESE MAY BE VALID USES OF SCARCE DOLLARS BUT OPTED TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISCUSSION AROUND SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDITS I THINK IT'S JUST- IT'S JUST NOT CORRECT AND SO. IF I WERE DRAFTING THIS BUDGET I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE FOCUS ON ACTUAL SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT ARE EMPLOYING- FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD REALLY WHAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT IS CAN WE FOCUS MORE RESOURCES ON OF THOSE SECTORS AND CAN WE CONSOLIDATE AND SIMPLIFY. THE TAX PROGRAMS AND THE GRANT PROGRAM SO IT'S JUST EASIER FOR EVERYDAY BUSINESSES- TO GET- I THINK A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS- FEEL LIKE THE GAME IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM UNLESS YOU'RE A LARGE CAN. MUSTER LARGE COMPANY THAT'S WELL CONNECTED YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET- ONE OF THESE GRANTS ARE THESE TAX CREDITS AND I AND I FEEL LIKE WERE PERPETRATING THAT WITH THAT WITH WITH THE DISCUSSION IN IN SUGGESTING THAT CAL COMPETES. IS A SMALL BUSINESS- IS SMALL BUSINESS TAX RETURN. YEAH IF I CAN JUST. A RAY. THAT I FOR. THE GOAL IS- TO. HOW YEAH I MEAN RIGHT IF THE DEMOCRATS MAY NOT GO TO A SMALL BUSINESS BUT THE SMALL BIT BUSINESSES BENEFIT NGUYEN WHAT SIERRA SPACE FIRM EXPANDS THEIR OPERATIONS IN A LOCAL AREA THE SMALL BUSINESSES. OUR GOING TO ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND SO THAT THAT I THAT I THINK IS THE LINK IS TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING STRONG. IT PARTICULARLY LOCAL AREAS THAT WOULD NEED THE ASSISTANCE SO THAT- SO THAT P. THE LOCAL ECONOMY'S FUTURE. RIGHT MEDICARE AND PUT I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT- FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE POLICY MAKERS TO GO BACK TO A SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES AND SAY HEY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GOING TO LARGE INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES- AND WE HOPE THAT SOME OF THAT'S GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN YOU WERE GONNA CALL THOSE SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDITS THAT JUST. THAT JUST DOESN'T FLY SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THESE ARE DIFFERENT DECISIONS WERE MAKING WE'VE GOT TO MAKE TRADE OFFS WITH SCARCE BUDGETS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA SPEND OUR RESOURCES AND I WOULD SUGGEST- THAT- THAT LET'S JUST LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS- WE'RE WE'RE HELPING TO SUPPORT THE SOME OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN OUR STATE- AND THAT MAY BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO INDUSTRY BY INDUSTRY BUT LET'S NOT CALL THEM. SMALL BUSINESS TAX RATES WERE PRETEND TO PAINT. THAT THAT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE CRYING OUT FOR MORE RESOURCES AND ONLY 6% OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY. GETTING THE GRANTS THAT WE LAID OUT WE ARE COMPLETELY OVERSUBSCRIBED STILL NOT THAT GREAT PROGRAM AND I JUST THINK WE SHOULD GET OUR RESOURCES OVER THERE. THANK YOU MR CHIU- THANK YOU MANAGER. I WOULD GENERALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND WITH SAY THAT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WAR IT'S A IT'S A COMMENT AND QUESTION ABOUT AND- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE. THE NOTION OF 1100% HELPING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT WE ARE NOT LOSING INDUSTRIES. TO OTHER STATES IN TERMS WE ACTUALLY. NEED TO FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT- QUITE QUICKLY. MY QUESTION TO THIS THIS PANEL IS THERE TO- TAX CREDITS DESCRIBE TODAY ONE FOR EARLY ACTION AND ONE FOR REGULAR BUDGET FOR A REGULAR BUDGET TIMELINE. WHAT CRITERIA DID KOBE IS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND EARLY ACTION AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS. WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT IS- WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES IS THE CAL COMPETES TALK TAX CREDIT TRYING TO ASSIST. S. ONE. TWO I'M SORRY MAJOR CAN YOU CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION WHAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION- NO PROBLEM CRITERIA DID GO BIZ USED TO DETERMINE. WHAT WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND EARLY ACTION. ALL RIGHT. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I MEAN I. I HAVE NOT BUT I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION OF. HOW TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES- AND SO. I CAN SAY THAT- IS CERTAINLY MAKING STREET CREDIT AND WAS. WAS THOUGHT OF AS A WAY TO HELP BUSINESSES WERE SPECIFICALLY- BY THE PANDEMIC AND ALSO THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS- I. I'M NOT SURE I CAN GIVE YOU A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ON THAT- COME THEN WE WILL FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET- A MORE DETAILED- ANSWER TO THAT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS- WHICH SMALL BIT- WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES IS THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT TRYING TO ASSIST. D- THE CAL COMPETE STRUCTURE IS REALLY GEARED ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY TO SMALL BUSINESS FOR TWO BY THE CENTRAL TO ANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT IS HI IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE CREATING JOBS ELSEWHERE SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF JOBS WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND SO IT'S NOT. AS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IT'S NOT GEARED SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES CERTAINLY SMALL BUSINESSES TANNIN DO RECEIVE THE CREDIT HEY IF THEY- IF THEY MEET THE- I TERIA. OR SELECTING- SELECT OVER OUT OF. AWARDEES ADAM CHARITY MY IF I GOT IT AT THE TIME CLARIFICATION TO THAT YES PLEASE. THANK YOU SO- AS IF MR CHAMBERLAIN POINTED OUT- YEAH WELL HOW COMPETE IS NOT GEARED SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WE HAVE ONLY HAD. A NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM I HAVE ANECDOTALLY YOU CAN SHARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WITH YOU- HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY CALLED SKY SLOPE- THAT- WHAT'S AT RISK FOR LEAVING FOR IT NEVADA BECAUSE THEIR PARENT COMPANY WAS LOCATED THERE HABITATIONAL OFFICE SPACE. AND IF NOT FOR THE KHALKHIN PIZZA CREDIT NOT ONLY WITH WE HAVE LOST THE FUTURE JOBS REPLACE THE EXISTING JOBS HERE AND OTHER LOCATED JUST BRING A CASE STREET DOWN THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS- COMPANY IT DOWN AND- IF THE IF THE AREA CALLED THE BROKEN TOOK AN- ALL BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURES GAME PIECES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE INTO THE VARIOUS GAMES OUT THERE THINK ABOUT THE MONOPOLY TOKENS THOSE TYPES OF PIECES. AND THEY WERE BEING HEAVILY RECRUITED TO ANOTHER NEIGHBORING STATE- THERE'S A- GREAT ARTICLE AT THE LOCAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SAN DIEGO ON THIS COMPANY THAT THEY'RE NOW GROWING AND EXPANDING. AND THEY'RE VERY SMALL BUSINESS- ONLY A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES BUT THEY BENEFITTED FROM THE KALKAJI CREDIT BECAUSE- THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN REFINED- IN LARGE PART. DUE TO THE ALLEY AS RECOMMENDATIONS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO RIDLEY FOCUS ON BUSINESSES FOR HOME BASED CREDIT IT'S GONNA BE A MATERIAL FACTOR IN THEIR DECISION TO GROW AND EXPAND CALIFORNIA. BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT- YEAH THAT GETS A NUMBER OF LARGE BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY LARGE COMPANIES LARGE BUSINESSES HAVE BENEFITTED LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS. BUT THESE ARE THE ONES THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE IN CALIFORNIA COMPANIES LIKE STAMPS ARE NETWORKS IN SAN FRANCISCO. THAT HAD IS COMMITTED TO CREATING TWO THOUSAND JOBS- BUT WAS LOOKING TO EXPAND ALSO HAS A HEADQUARTERS AND IN GEORGIA AND WAS LOOKING AT BOTH GEORGIA AND CALIFORNIA AND THIS CREDIT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THEIR EXPANDING IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS GEORGIA- WE HAD AND EVEN JUST THAT RECENTLY- WE AWARDED A CREDIT TO SEPI. WHICH. IS A MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS IT BENEFACTOR MAKE THEM. THAT DETECT BETTER THAN EVER IN AT THE BACK. BY AND- THEY WERE DEBATING WHETHER TO. OVER OR WHETHER SIX AT THEIR PLACE. AND ACTS AND IT'S A RESULT OF TALCUM THEY'VE NOWCOMMITTED TO CREATING A TWENTY. HAD NEW FULL JOBS. IN LODI. SO JUST IT'S MECHANICAL X. OF THE OVER THOUSAND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED A CREDIT OVER THE LAST SEVEN THAT'S- THANK YOU MISTER DOES A GUY A- THE- EXPANDED COMMENTARY AND I RECOGNIZE THE- INCREDIBLE PRESSURES THAT- EVERYONE IS CURRENTLY UNDER BUT IT SEEMS DISINGENUOUS TO TRY TO PAINT- CAL COMPETES ARE GIVEN THAT SEVERAL TIMES. IN THE LAST FEW COMMENTS- IT'S BEEN STATED THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WHY IS IT BEING PAINTED AS A SMALL BUSINESS TAX PROPOSAL. YEAH I APOLOGIZE IF THE STREET CHILDREN CAN I APOLOGIZE IF I SAID THAT THE IT IS NOT AND DOES NOT HELP SMALL BUSINESS I SAID IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SET UP SPECIFICALLY TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES ALTHOUGH IT DOES HELP SMALL BUSINESS SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION OR IT'S ACTUALLY MORE CONFUSING SO YOU SAY IT IT'S NOT INTENDED IT'S NOT SET UP TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BUT IT DOES NOT HELP SMALL BUSINESSES SO. HOW MANY. SAYS HAS IT HELPED. WELL I THINK JUST GAVE OR FIVE MR MR LOS GOOD GAVE- SEVERAL. AND WE COULD WE COULD PROVIDE YOU A- FULL LIST IF. YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT. MY POINT IS THAT IS THE- IT DOESN'T- FOLKS ON SMALL BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE CREDITS. TO FOCUS IS ON THE- THAT MEET THE- SET UP IN STATURE. WELL I HOPE THAT YOU. DRAW ON THE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAMBERLAIN ACTUALLY LIKE- FOR US TO FOLLOW AND GET A OF ALL SMALL BIZ THAT HAVE BEEN HELD- THE MISTER SUGGEST IT WAS OF ANECDOTES EXAM BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO BY. IT IS VERY. TO BE A OF THE LAW AND GO BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND GO BACK TO OUR OUR SMALL BUSINESS ROUND TABLES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND DO THIS KIND OF BACK AND FORTH DANCE OF WHAT ACTUALLY IS A SMALL BUSINESSES A SMALL BUSINESS HOW ARE THEY BEING HELPED ACTUALLY NO THIS IS MORE FOR LARGER. LARGER COMPANIES SO IT'S STILL INCREDIBLY CONFUSING AND IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT'S JUST BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION BUT IF YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN ME AND- A PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT. MADAM CHECK IT IF I CAN JUST CLARIFY. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER ANY INTENT TO BUY THE KOBE CITY MINISTRATION TO REPRESENT KALKAJI IT'S AS ONE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAMS- I'M NOT SURE. ABOUT WHEN OR HOW THE DECISION WAS MADE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IN THE CONTEXT OF SMALL BUSINESSES- SO JUST WANT TO PUT THAT CONTACT THAT WITH ME I COULD LIKE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND- I JUST WANNA MAKE CLEAR THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER ANY ANTI I INTENT ON OUR PART TO MARKET THIS PROGRAM AND- THE NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM IN A SMALL BUSINESS. A LOT IN CONTEXT. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLEAR. IF THAT'S IF THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE THINKING ABOUT THIS ADDITIONAL TAX CREDIT AS A SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT. IS THAT ACCURATE. BUT MR CHAMBERLAIN FOR I HAVE I BELIEVE. YOU YES I AGREE THAT THEY DID NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SMALL BUSINESS. TAX RETURN.

IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THEIR- THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS SKILL SETS AND- AND- OTHER YOU KNOW THE GROWTH AND- BUSINESS PLANT MEASURES AND THOSE ARE NETWORK WHAT ESSENTIALLY DISPERSED THE FUNDING WE WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE CRITERIA AND- AND INTO WHO THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE DIRECTED. IN PARTICULAR AND AS ALWAYS TO UNDERSERVED BUSINESS GROUPS INCLUDING WOMEN VETERANS MINORITIES DOES IN RURAL AND LOW WHILE THE. DISASTER TACTIC COMMUNITIES. AND WITH I GUESS I WILL PASS IT OFF- THE SMALL BUSINESS FINE CENTER. I DO. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ON SCOTT LIEU AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC BELT BACK. OR I BACK. UP I WOULD LIKE TO COVER BOTH THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS ON YOUR KEY PROGRAM. AND THE FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTERS CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND LOAN INITIATIVES FOR UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE IN MARIN- LEVINE SETTING. BECAUSE I IN READING THROUGH THE SUBCOMMITTEE JANET DESCRIPTIONS I BELIEVE THERE IS STAY IN NUMBER OF PLACE WHICH THE OPENING PARAGRAPH DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE TWO PROGRAMS I WANTED BY TO THE OTHER AND VICE VERSA. INSTEAD OF THE SMALL BUSINESS LONGER IF YOU PROGRAM IS A TOPIC. FOR THE PANEL EIGHT AND THREE. AND THE BUSINESS GRANTS OUR REQUESTED CALIFORNIA REBELLING FINE WOULD YOU COVERED IN PETAL NINE. WHICH PROBABLY CAUSED SOME CONFUSION. AND SO IF YOU THAT I CAN SPEAK TO BOTH PROGRAMS TOGETHER. OR WE COULD SEPARATE THOSE ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT SCHEDULE. GO AHEAD MR WILL THANK YOU. A THREE MUCH. SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OR I THINK SMALL BUSINESS GOING HERE KEEP PROGRAM THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE PROGRAM BY BANKS SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER THAT AS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. FIRE TO THE FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY A BUDGET.FROM THE STATE THE PROGRAM LAST RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN TWENTY ELEVEN BABY FOR NINE DOLLARS. THESE FUNDS CONTINUE TO REVOLVE AND SERVE THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED FOR ONE POINT SIX BILLION OF LOANS. THE PROGRAM IS UTILIZED BY THE FIRST BASED SMALL BUSINESSES UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES WITH LARGER LOAN SIZES AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A LOAN. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM IS APPROACHING FULL CAPACITY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE CARD FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEES WILL LIKELY BE HOLLYWOOD VERGE SOMETIME LATER THIS SUMMER. ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUED ON ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT WILL BE LEVERAGED TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN MOMENTS ARE WHAT YOU BY LEVERAGE. THE L. NINE ITEM IS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTERS CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FONG AND INITIATIVES FOR UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. SO THE BUDGET PROVIDES A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR I BANKS SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS. THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER MANAGES SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ARE GUARANTEES DISASTER LOAN GUARANTEES PRIMATECH GUARANTEES OUR DIRECT LENDING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JUMPSTART A STARTUP LOANS IN ADDITION IT CAN QUICKLY ADD YOU PROGRAMS IT JUST IMMEDIATE MARKET NEEDS. AS IT DID LAST APRIL WITH THE COVER NINETEEN MICRO LOAN GUARANTEE. BROWN'S THAT UP EVER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND BUSINESSES THAT AVERAGE FIVE INVOICE. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED BY THE MOST UNDERSERVED AND THE SMALLEST OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LONG TERM RECOVERY CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ONE HUNDRED ALL POINTS SB INTERNATIONAL TO HELP CREATE THE CALIFORNIA RECOMPILE. BOB THIS IS INTENDED TO AGGREGATE FUNDING FOR PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC PUBLIC SECTOR SOURCES THEY TRUST THE COUPLE NEEDS A SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY REOPEN RECOVERED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND IS INTENDED TO SERVE THE SMALLEST AND THE MOST UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP AN ESSENTIAL PART CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. WITH THE RECENT STATE COMMITMENTS OF THIRTY SEVEN A HALF MILLION WHICH INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. AND OUTSPOKENNESS RATIONS ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH. THE FUND IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF CAPITAL. AS IT PURSUES ITS GOAL OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION. THE POTENTIAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET IS INTENDED FOR THE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T FIND AT ACROSS AYE BIG SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES THE CARD A PRECURSOR BUSINESSES SAYS MARKET CONDITIONS ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING. AND NEW SOLUTIONS ARE BEING TRADED INTRUST THIS MASSIVE FUNDING GAP IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RETAIN FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT SUCH FUNDS AND JUST TOOLS OR PROGRAMS THAT MAY BETTER ASSIST UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES ESCONDIDA ADDITION DEFAULT. I INTO ORACLE YOU'RE PROGRAM OR INTO NEW VEHICLES WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING FIVE. SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT RELATED TO HOW. MANY OF THESE ARE VARIOUS FISCAL PROGRAMS IT TOGETHER AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND SO I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE'S A BROAD SPECTRUM SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS- WE SERVE SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LOANS UP TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR EMPLOYEE BASE IS UP THE SEVEN FIFTY. AND AS I MENTIONED IN OUR COMMUNITY PROGRAM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO STOP REQUIRE SHIPS AND BUSINESSES THAT AVERAGE UNDER FIVE BOYS. AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCT NEEDS AND THAT WE TRY TO SERVICE THEM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WE ALSO HAVE FARM LOANS STARTUP LOANS BY MICEK BONES AND OTHER SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. THAT INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. RELATIVE TO SOME OF THESE. THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY- AND HOW THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER WHAT THE GRANT FUNDING PROGRAMS ARE REALLY DESIGNED FOR FAST IMMEDIATE RELIEF. TO COVER EXPENSES- TO PROMOTE SURVIVAL IN CRITICAL TIMES- THE- THE PURPOSE THERE IS TO REALLY GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND INTO THE ECONOMY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ONE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED NOT FOR FAST ACTION THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE AVAILABLE CONSISTENT A LONG TERM BASIS AS INVESTMENT CAPITAL FOR REBUILDING PURPOSES. WE OFFER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THEIR CHIP PROGRAMS ARE GUARANTEE PROGRAMS OFFLOAD RISK REMINDERS BUT THEY RELY ON A BENEFITTED MARKET. IN DEEP RECESSIONS AND IN TIMES OF VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET PLACE MANY LENDERS AWAY IN CAPITAL BECOME SCARCE AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE A GUARANTEE THAT CAN OFFLOAD RISK APPLE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. THERE BY THIS IS THE STATE EVEN NEED TO WATCH THE CALIFORNIA DOUBLE TALK. I IN ADDITION A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS OF ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT ARE OFTEN UNDERSTAFFED- WHAT'S THE BEST GIG IN REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION SUPPORT. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER PROGRAMS AND CONTINUED THE BILL NEEDS A VOICE WHERE THEY EXIST AND EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS WORKS WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER AND- PROVIDE LITTLE OVERLAP. ON THE PROGRAM'S. CONCERT WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. AND THEN THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER ONE FOR THOSE ARE FOLLOWINGONLINE- AND THE- WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG THIS LAST SESSION AS WE COME TO A CLOSE AS BOTH ISSUE EIGHT TEN ISSUE NINE. WHICH IS BOTH- ADDITIONAL SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSALS AND ISSUE NINE BEING THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC. OF BANK A SMALL BUSINESS CENTER I ALSO WANT TO BRING INTO THE CONVERSATION WITH TOMORROW JOHNSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO IS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK ON THE ISSUE NINE. MISTRANSLATION YOU MADAM CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON TEMARA JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO MR GROUP OR- CLARIFYING THAT TO PASS A PROPOSALS AND I'M WITH MATH AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S. AND I DO HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF OVERLAP SINCE WE COMBINED- ISSUE EIGHT INITIAL NINE TOGETHER SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS ARE VERY IS BECAUSE- PROGRAMS THAT GO BIZ AND THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ARE PROPOSING THIS YEAR HOW DO THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER AND WHAT SMALL BUSINESS TYPES DO THEY TARGET WITH THE AID HOW TO SMALL BUSINESSES LEARN ABOUT ALL THE PROGRAMS AND WHICH ONE IS. THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR THEM. HELLO MADAM CHAIR THIS IS MORAL OR SEE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO PULL UP SOME INFORMATION HERE. ONE JUST IN A LONG. THANK YOU FOR THAT GENEROSITY- SO YET THESE PROGRAMS- ARE ARE TARGETING. DIFFERENT GROUPS FOR THE MOST PART AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT AGAIN SMALL BUSINESSES AS THE OPPOSITE SMALL BUSINESS INDICATES I'M- ONLY START WITH THE OUTRAGE ENGAGEMENT ONE FIRST THAT ONE IS MEANT TO REACH EIGHT A MUCH BROADER- FIELD OF SMALL BUSINESSES ANY SMALL BUSINESS THAT'S LOOKING FOR RESOURCES ASSISTANCE. TECHNICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES OR TRAINING THAT TYPE OF THING THAT IS OPEN ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE REASON AGAIN FOR THIS AND THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING NEED IS REALLY ABOUT% ON THE INCREASED DEMAND ON OUR OFFICE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CODE CLIMATE BUT IT'S BEEN GROWING A MASSIVELY YEAR OVER YEAR AND IT FEELS LIKE THE STATE IS SOMEWHAT IN A STATE OF ON GOING DISASTER RESPONSE. WHICH REALLY IMPACTS SMALL BUSINESSES THE HARDEST AND- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX ON THAT AND- WITH RESPECT TO THE INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUBS ARE THE I. HUB SQUARED PROGRAM. THIS WOULD GO TO SUPPORT THE INNOVATION CENTER IS THE PLACES WHERE START UPS GO TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND IT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE STARTED THIS THIS CALIFORNIA CULTURE OF SUPPORTING INNOVATION IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THESE CENTERS THAT TYPICALLY DO GET FUNDING FROM. YOU KNOW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE LAND. AND SO THOSE ENTITIES WOULD HAVE THE FUNDING TO THE ANSWER IN THEIR SUPPORT- THOSE START. THAT ARE DOING IN THE INNOVATION WORK. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FUND WOULD WE WOULD YEAR OLD AGAIN WOULD UTILIZE OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORKS YOU TO REACH OUT TO THE REACH THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THESE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SEED GRANTS. THIS IS AGAIN IN ANOTHER INNOVATION APPROACH BUT THROUGH A DIFFERENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT WERE REACHING THE APPROPRIATE. THETARGETED AUDIENCE FOR THIS- AGAIN THIS IS MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT NEED AN EXTRA BOOST TO GET THEIR BUSINESSES LAUNCHED- AND- OUR NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS IS FUNDED THROUGH A STATE PROGRAM THE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT WAS- ENACTED A FEW YEARS AGO I THINK IT WAS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE. MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND- THAT NETWORK IS OF BOTH STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER SO THEY HAVE A BREATH OF REACH INTO INTO COMMUNITIES AGAIN SAMPOERNA CONCEPT THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM IT'S A HUB AND SPOKE MODEL THEY'RE ALL OVER THE STATE AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE FUNDING WOULD. COME FROM I HOPE. THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION LET ME KNOW IF IT DOESN'T. IT'S HELPFUL TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND- DIRECTION AND WHERE THAT FUNDING WHERE THAT FUNDING IS ACTUALLY GOING UP SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP I HOPE I A I DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS TO THAT HOW DOES THE PROGRAM OR AYE HUBS OR IN ITS NEW FACE AYE HOPES TO COMPLEMENT AND NOT DUPLICATE. THE STATE'S MANY OTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CAREER PATHWAYS AND SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. BUT GREAT QUESTION SO THIS WOULD SPECIFICALLY TARGETING THE- INNOVATION HUBS OF THE ONES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT PROVIDING RESOURCES TO START UP ORGANIZATIONS AND- AND SOAK. IT WHAT IF IT'S NOT PROVIDING THE SAME SERVICE IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FUNDING- IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT WE AREN'T DOING RIGHT NOW- THESE ENTITIES WHICH ARE ALL OVER THE STATE REALLY TYPICALLY ATTRACTED A START UPS THAT ARE WORKING IN SCIENCE OR MANUFACTURING. VERY DISTINCT OF AREA IN THE SMALL BUSINESS ROUND AND SO AGAIN THE FUNDING FOR THE I HAVE SQUARE WOULDN'T BE GOING TO THE BUSINESSES DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD BE GOIG TO THE CENTERS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE START UPS IT'S A IT'S A VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIALIZED TYPE OF SUPPORT THAT START UPS. NEED AND IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SUPPORT INNOVATION IN OUR STATE THE START UPS EVENTUALLY BECOME YOU KNOW BIG CORPORATIONS THAT MAKE THEIR HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. SEVERAL ARTICLES HAVE IN THE PAST INDICATED THAT START UP CULTURE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT VERY INCLUSIVE AND IN FACT IT LACKS A LOT OF DIVERSITY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE- A SOME OF THE KEY INDICATORS THAT YOU THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S- DIVERSITY IN THESE EFFORTS. BUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I MEAN WE WOULD BE TARGETING. INNOVATIVE START UPS OR WE WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THE THESE THE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING THE GRANTS TO BE FOCUSING ON WOMEN OWNED MINORITY. BY POCK AT SUNRISE THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY OF THE PROGRAM AND IT WOULD BE TARGETED TOWARDS UNDERSERVED INNOVATIVE STARTUP WONDERFUL ENTREPRENEURS. THANK YOU MISS PARSON AGAIN IT'S THE THOSE VERY SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING IN A FEW ISSUES AGO IN HOW ARE YOU TRACKING THE DATA. SO IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE OUR INCLUSION OR DIVERSITY MORE WOMEN MORE BY POCK MORE- MINORITY MINORITY. INNOVATION HOW ARE YOU TRACKING THAT AND WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT INFORMATION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I AM HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THIS I HAVEN'T DIVED DEEPLY INTO THE- HOW WE WOULD ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM AND FORTUNATE I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT DATA OR- YOU KNOW THE- LENS INTO HOW WE'RE GOING TO. OPERATE THIS PROGRAM I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT I WILL GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU AND IT'S AGAIN UP TO THE- THE COMMENT THAT I MADE EARLIER THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL NOT A CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY FUNDING THAT GOES INTO ANY NEW INNOVATION PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S- START UP OR OTHERWISE THAT WE'RE BEING INCLUSIVE IN. AND HAVE STANDARDS TO BE MET AND GOALS TO ACHIEVE. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY CREATING THAT PROCESS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MMHM I LET'S SEE AN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- FOR ME I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO- MR WU- WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM LEAVES SO MUCH UP TO THE DISCRETION OF AYE BANK. YET THE TO REFERRING TO THE SECOND- FIFTY ONE DOLLAR PROGRAM THAT THE WAY TO THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER. TARGETED FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING PART. OF THE FIRST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. IS FOR A VERY LONG STEP WHICH PROGRAM- IT IT WOULD JUST BE KEPT QUIET SO PROGRAM THAT IS REACHING ITS LEVERAGE CAP. OUT SOMETIME LATER THIS SUMMER. SO FOR THIS PURPOSE YES CENTER. WE ASKED TO HAVE- SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN LATITUDE. BECAUSE IN A VOLATILE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND YOUR SHIPPING VERY QUICKLY. AND FOR EXAMPLE LAST APRIL. WHEN THERE WAS A IMMEDIATE NEED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THOSE THAT. WEREN'T ELIGIBLE OR NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF. WE NEED A PROGRAM VERY QUICKLY GO OUT THE DOOR. THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO GET FUNDS TO THOSE MICRO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE QUICKLY WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS OR DIMANCHE. COBIT NINETEEN INITIATIVE. WITHIN OUR DISASTER PROGRAM WE HAVE LET YOU WITH AND THAT'S CORRECT. TO DO SO. AND SO THIS TIME AROUND. WAITER WHEN WE- ENTER THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUNDS. THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND LAUNCHING THE MEMBER TWENTIETH. AND IT'S STILL EARLY IN ITS INCEPTION. IT'S NOT ABOUT. TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF LOANS TO DATE. IT'S GONNA CONTINUE TO. A SUCH MY OF CAPITAL. THE FIRST REASON IT FALTERED IN THAT PATH- WE WOULD WATCH BE ABLE TO. THE ABILITY TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS PERHAPS YOU'RE ALONE OKAY I THINK INITIATIVE PERHAPS TO OTHER INITIATIVES ALSO THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING ON. IS AT A CUT BY MARKET CONDITIONS AND CAN. OTHER VEHICLES WERE THEIR UMBRELLA RIGHT NOW THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TWO VEHICLES BOTH OF WHICH WOULD PARTICIPATE IN. ONE LEVERAGES OUR LOAN GUARANTEES THE OTHER LEVERAGES THE FIRST LOSS INVESTMENT FROM THE IPAD. AND SO IF THERE WERE TO BE A NEED FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE. OF INSTRUMENT TO ADDRESS THE MARKETPLACE NEEDS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO SO ALL WITH A GREAT GRAND MISSION OF SERVING THE BUS UNDERSERVED THE SMALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SO WE'VE DONE THAT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN PROGRAM WHERE 85% OF THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT THEMSELVES A BAR CODED. A MICRO LOAN GUARANTEES- ARE EITHER A FEMALE OR- MINORITY OWNED OR ARE LOCATED IN BLOW TO MODERATE. OF SEVERAL OF THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND IS TARGETING THE SAME CONSTITUENCY USING MANY OF THE SAME PARTNERS THAT THAT WE USE FOR OUR GUARANTEE PROGRAM. AND THEIR STAFFS ARE VERY SIMILAR. I BELIEVE THEY ARE ASKED- 84% SO WE'RE- SPOT ON TERMS OF UNDER A- POPULATION. THAT WERE TRYING TO TARGET. AND SO THAT WILL REMAIN THE SAME THE FINANCIAL TOOL AN INSTRUMENT TO APPLY TO REACH THIS POPULATION. MAY CHANGE. AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER YOU START WITH YOUR TEETH PROGRAM. GUARANTEE PROGRAM DURING NORMAL TIMES FUNCTIONS VERY WELL. IN A BALL TOLD RECESSION REGISTERED MARKET BUT WONDERS AWAY AND THEY'RE NOT WILLINGTO WRECK BONES EVEN IF WE'RE WILLING TO OFF LOAD BREAST THEREFORE THE NEED ROSE FOR CALIFORNIA BILLION FIND WHAT WE COULD PROVIDE CAPITAL TO THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL AND- INSTITUTIONS HAVE MONEY TO PLAN. SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY USE OUR- AND SO WE HAD IT. THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF FLEXIBLE IN LATITUDE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN. HAVING SAID THAT IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN AS IT'S BEEN EVOLVING CERTAINLY AND THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPITAL. AVAILABLE FROM OUR INITIAL FIRST LOSS INVESTMENT WE WOULD. UP PRESUMABLY PUT ALLTHAT MONEY INTO RECOVERY GOING ON SO THEY COULD GO OUT AND RAISE MORE SENIOR CAPITAL. AND CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL THEY'VE MET THE NEED- TO PROVIDE CAPITAL FIFTY DEVICES- THE REBELLING BUT- IF I'M INTERJECT ABOUT INTER. THIS IS BRIAN WITH A PRETTY CLEAR YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT- REGARDING THE FIFTY MILLION- THAT WOULD BE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF I THINK- WELL- MISTER WAS POINTER PROBABLY WELL TAKEN- IT IS A BIT UNUSUAL TO PROVIDE. THAT DEGREE OF DISCRETION TO THE IN THE TREATMENT- SOMETHING TO CONSIDER MIGHT BE INCLUDING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE- I MEAN FOR SOME SORT OF NOTIFICATION- ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE USED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION MAKES A DETERMINATION IF. IF THEY IF THE LEGISLATURE IS- IS- YOU KNOW- AN AGREEMENT ON THE GENERAL INTENT. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER WEATHERFORD. I WANT TO GO BACK TO MISS MISS FARSI ON A QUESTION ON I HAVE CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO SOLVE AND IN WHAT WAYS IS THE CURRENT I HAVE NETWORK NOT WORKING ARE THERE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN INDUSTRY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS ENTREPRENEURS UNIVERSITIES AND GOVERNMENT- IN A DEFICIENT SOME SPECIFIC WAY AND HOW WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AS MY SON. PARTY ON THE LINE. MADAM CHAIR YES- I APOLOGIZE I HAD TO STEP AWAY FOR JUST A SECOND- MAY I ASK YOU TO ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN APOLOGIES NO PROBLEM BUT FIRST YOU MUST LET ME KNOW IF WITH THAT ADORABLE LITTLE CHILD. THIS IS MY YOU KNOW THEY THEY GROW. SHE JUST WOKE UP SORRY IT'S TOTALLY OKAY THAT'S THAT THAT'S CURRENTLY ARE ARE ARE WORKING LIFE SITUATIONS I APPRECIATED AND I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING TIME AS WELL MY QUESTION WAS- WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND THIS PROPOSAL I HOPE IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE. IN WHAT WAYS IS THE CURRENT I HAVE NETWORK NOT WORKING ARE THERE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN INDUSTRY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS ENTREPRENEURS AT THAT ARE- THAT ARE DEFICIENT IN SOME WAY. SURE IT SO IT SHOULD BE I HOPE PROGRAM I'M HAS FOR THE MOST PART THE CART WHEN IT'S IN STATUTE HAS EXPIRED AND THERE WAS NEVER A FINANCIAL COMPONENT TO IT SO. I THINK WHAT THE PROGRAM. THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE INNOVATIVE START UPS AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES. IN IN NOT YOU KNOW CULTURE THAT YOU MENTIONED SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS- YOU KNOW HOPING THAT THIS THE STATE FUNDING WILL CREATE. IN A WAY FOR OUR- THE- INNOVATION CENTERS TO DO MORE LEVERAGING WITH STATE FUNDING TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT FROM FROM FROM LARGER- YOU KNOW VENTURE CAPITALIST CAPITALIST OR CORPORATIONS OR FLAT. SORRY TO CREE MORE HIGH ROAD. AND AND- FIND A WAY TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES TO FIND A PATH TO WEALTH CREATION. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. IT DOES TO AN EXTENT AND A YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT THROUGH WHAT IS THE PROBLEM. AGAIN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND IF WE'RE GONNA BE ALLOCATING FUNDING THEN HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IS FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND THEY WERE MAKING SURE THAT. WE ARE- BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT A PROGRAM AND ANY FUTURE- INCOME INTENTION OR ALLOCATION OF FUNDING. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE APPRISED OF FOLLOW UP ON. HOW THIS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED WE WOULD OF COURSE BE TRACKING- HOW THE FUNDS ARE USED BY OUR- I HAVE NETWORK- AND- WHO RECEIVES THE FUNDING- SO. ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS WE GET IT BUT THIS WOULD BE OF COURSE TRACKED. I'M I'M NOT SURE OF THE COMMITTEES AWARE BUT THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THIS TYPE OF. DATA COLLECTION AND- AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD INCORPORATE INTO. ANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU GUYS- GENEROUSLY APPROVED TO US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND WITH THAT I WANNA THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS THAT HAVE- MADE TIME TO BE PART OF THIS A SHORT THREE HOUR HEARING. REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I AM NOW A PARTY OF ONE HERE IN THIS AND THIS COMMITTEE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHO MAY TIME AND ASK QUESTIONS AS WELL AS EVERY- THE PANELISTS THAT PARTICIPATED TODAY I THINK A- LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. ARE ABOUT DISCRETION. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN TERMS OF- EXPANSION OF ANY PROGRAM OR THE CREATION OF NEW PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO. FACILITATE AND ADMINISTER THOSE PROGRAMS WE HAVE IT A NEW VACANCY. WITH THE DIRECTOR OF GOLD IS GOING TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND- I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW. ARE THESE NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED- GIVEN THAT WE ARE LOSING LEADERSHIP- IN THE STATE- FOR GOOD REASONS OBVIOUSLY. BUT PUTTING US IN A IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO REIMAGINE. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- AND OF COURSE COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THERE IS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND- DATA. THAT INFORMS US TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO STATUTE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND ULTIMATELY HOW DO WE CREATE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND NOT A CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. ENSURING THAT EVERY COMMUNITY HAS ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND- KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE. DEFICIENCIES AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS TO RESOURCES LANGUAGE COMPETENCY CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND THAT WE ARE MOVING AT A AT A AT A PACE SO FAST. THAT IT ACTUALLY- A RACE TO THE TOP LEAVING MANY PEOPLE.
