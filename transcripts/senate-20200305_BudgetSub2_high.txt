GOOD MORNING DIRECTOR HOW WHAT A BETTER WAY FOR SOME TO THE START OFFICE IT'S A- HERE WITH AN UPDATE ON OUR BUDGET BASED. PROGRAM. THANK HERE GO AHEAD. MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THANK YOU FOR CARVING OUT A FEW MINUTES IN AN OTHERWISE BUSY DAY. I MENTIONED IT YESTERDAY AND THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE ONE GOAL FOR THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES. THAT'S TO MAKE THIS AN EXCITING. CAPTIVATING TELLING PRESENTATION EVEN THOUGH IT'S ENTIRELY ABOUT BUSINESS ANALYTICS I WANNA PAINTERS STORY FOR YOU TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY. A WALK AROUND OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING AT THE DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE A SERIES OF SLIDES LET'S CALL THE COVER SLIDE SLIDE ONE AND SLIDE TO IS. PHOTO OF TWO BIRDS WITH A FISH STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. FLYING THE ABSENT GEN AND FOR US LIFE IN OUR DEPARTMENT OFTEN FEELS LIKE BEING THAT FISH STUCK BETWEEN COMPETING INTERESTS. SO FROM THAT PLATFORM WHAT IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. IT TURNS OUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSINESS DISCIPLINE PEOPLE STUDIED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL THERE'S A MANAGEMENT FIELD ABOUT IT. IT'S FOCUSED ON TASKS OF AN ENTERPRISE LABOR OF AN ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION OF THAT ENTERPRISE IT'S ITERATIVE. AND IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT VALUES. THOSE ARE EFFICIENCIES TRANSPARENCY INCLUSIVITY TRUST. SO WE AT THE DEPARTMENT ARE ENGAGED IN SERVICE BASED BUDGETING WE HAVE FOUR GOALS YOU'LL SEE THEM THERE ON PAGE TWO. ASIAN BIRD PHOTO WE WANTED TO FIND OUR SERVICE STANDARDS WE WANNA GET TO DETAILED COST ESTIMATES WE WANT TO COMPARE OUR SERVICE TO OUR MISSION LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES. AND WE ARE ONE ANALYZE OUR REVENUE FUNDING AND STRUCTURE. BUT HOW DID WE GET HERE. IT'S ACTUALLY A SEVENTY YEAR ISSUE. I HAVE IN MY FILES A REPORT FROM NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY MANAGEMENT FIRM CALLED BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON. THEY DID A REPORT FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT THEY CONCLUDED OUR DEPARTMENT SUFFERED FROM LACK OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTUALLY AMENDED THE FISH AND GAME CODE. SECTION SEVEN TEN POINT FIVE SAYS THAT A LEGISLATIVE FINDING LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT SUFFERS FROM LACK OF STABLE FUNDING NEEDS TO SECURE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. COME INTO THE TWO THOUSANDS THE LEGISLATURE SPOKE AGAIN. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN IT CREATED A BLUE RIBBON PANEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR DEPARTMENT. I HAD THE ODD EXPERIENCE OF BEING A BLUE RIBBON PANEL MEMBER. AND THEN BECOMING DIRECTOR. OF THE DEPARTMENT DURING THAT PROCESS. IT ENDED WITH A REPORT OF TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. COME INTO THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. IN THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN SPOKE. YOU TOLD US TO RECONVENE THE BLUE RIBBON PANEL. COALITION YOU TOLD US TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAD MADE ON THIS TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND YOU TOLD US TO ENGAGE IN A MISSION BASED BUDGET REVIEW PROCESS WE STARTED THAT. THEN YOU GET TO THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S THE MOST RELEVANT INSTRUCTION. YOU'VE GIVEN US RECENTLY. YOU ACTUALLY APPROVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS AND THIRTY POSITIONS CONTINGENT ON. COMPLETING SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. YOU LAID OUT A SERIES OF MILESTONES WE IN MY JUDGMENT HAVE HIT EVERY MILESTONE YOU PUT IN STATUTE. HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. WE RECONVENE THAT EXTERNAL COMMUNITY IT'S AN EIGHTY PLUS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I REDIRECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF OUR LEADERSHIP STAFF THE FOCUS ON THIS ENDEAVOR. OUR DIALOGUE OVER THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR HAS INVOLVED YOUR BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF SUBJECT MATTER STAFF FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT EIGHTY PLUS EXTERNAL COMMUNITY. AND NOW SHE COULD TURN TO SLIDE THREE. THE HIGHER IS CDF W. SERVICE AREAS. FIRST THING WE DID WITH THAT MULTI PARTY GROUP. WE FORCED OURSELVES TO STOP USING BUREAUCRATIC LINGO ON HOW WE DESCRIBE WHAT WE DO. AND WE USE THAT GROUP TO HELP US FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DESCRIBE OUR SERVICE AREASIN PLAINER LANGUAGE. THAT'S THESE EIGHT CATEGORIES YOU NOW SEE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE BLEW UP ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY BOXES AS MUCH AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO GROUP SERVICE. INTO COMPONENTS THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND. AND IF YOU ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WHICH HAS A PICTURE OF ONE OF OUR OFFICERS WITH BINOCULARS. WE TOOK THOSE EIGHT SERVICE AREAS IN OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE DONE THESE THINGS. HERE'S THE CORE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING YOU LIST OUT EVERY TASK THE BUSINESS DOES. WE CAME UP WITH THE TASK REGISTRY OF ALMOST THREE THOUSAND TASKS. THEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT LABOR HOURS ARE BEING SPENT ON EACH TASK. AND THEN YOU COMPARE THE SERVICE CURRENTLY AGAINST AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOUR SERVICE WOULD BE IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HITTING YOUR MISSION. ALL YOUR MANDATES. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN AND HAVE COMPLETED AS OF LAST YEAR. THAT TAKES YOU TO THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIVE WHICH IS KIND OF THE BEGINNING OF THE MONEY SLIDE IF YOU WILL IN THE SENSE THAT WHAT YOU GET AFTER DOING THAT EXERCISE. IS AN ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT THE GAS. BETWEEN WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU'RE COMMUNITY EUREX COLONEL FOLKS AND YOUR BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THINK YOU NEED TO BE. BUT IMPORTANTLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL A GAP JUST ADDING LABOR HOURS. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DEAL WITH YOUR GAP PROBLEMS YOU CAN. GET RID OF OLD ARCHAIC MANDATES. YOU CAN ACHIEVE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR PARTNERSHIPS WHICH CAN BRING DOWN YOUR GAP. YOU CAN INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT OF COURSE YOU COULD DO LABOR AS WELL. SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS TOTAL PRELIMINARY DATA% ANALYSIS. TOOK A LONG TIME TO VAT WITH SOME OF YOUR STAFF IN THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS ENGAGED. THIS IS A- GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF WHAT YOU SEE. AFTER YEARS WORTH THE WORK WITH ALL THE PARTIES AND DELOITTE ILLUSTRATING THE GAP. THE GAP IS BIGGEST IN SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND PERMITTING AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THIS IS A METRIC BASED ON LABOR HOURS THAT'S THE WAY THE TEMPLATE AND- THE ARITHMETIC WORKS. SO WHAT'S LEFT TO HAD TO DO. WELL WE WE'VE GOT TO DO A COUPLE THINGS. WE GOTTA CREATE THE DIGITAL AND ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE THAT THIS BECOMES THE INTEREST TOOL WE'RE USING EVERY YEAR GOING FORWARD. WE'RE DOING WELL I'M CREATING THAT WE'VE GOT A TRAIN ALMOST THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT THIS IS OUR NEW BUSINESS AS USUAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT BUDGETING. WE WANTED TO BE AN ITERATIVE TOOL YOU CAN ASK US QUESTIONS WE CAN RESPOND PRETTY QUICKLY AND THIS KIND OF. LAY OUT IN FORMAT. EVERY YEAR WE WILL UPDATE THE SERVICE LEVEL DATA. EVERY FIVE YEARS WE WILL UPDATE THE MISSION LEVEL ESTIMATES. AND THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT TO GET INTO OUR REVENUE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WE HAVE ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF A WHOLE VAST ARRAY OF DEDICATED ACCOUNTS. AND WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE NEXT PHASE KIND OF ON PACKING THAT WITH THIS EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN WITH YOU. BUT I WANT TO END BY SAYING REALLY I THINK SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS JUST. TOOL ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. I THINK WE HAVE A CHOICE. AND THE CHOICE IS ONE WE COLLECTIVELY SHARES CALIFORNIANS. WHAT DO WE WANT OUR FUTURE TO BE WE HAVE A MOMENT IN TIME. I'M MOTIVATED BY A HIGH SENSE OF URGENCY. OUR DEPARTMENT THINKS ABOUT OUR MISSION IN TWENTY TWENTY AS SAVING NATURE. THAT'S IT. IT'S A NATURE THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM BEES THE BUTTERFLIES TO THE KELP FOREST TO WHALES IN THE OCEAN TO MOUNTAIN LIONS. WE DO THINGS WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. THE VERY FIRST WILDLIFE AGENCY IN THE WAR IN THE NATION WAS THE BOARD OF FISH COMMISSIONERS A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO. WHAT WE DO SO MUCH MORE TODAY. THAT THOSE FOLKS COULDN'T IMAGINE BACK THEN. IT'S ABOUT PRESERVING LAND WATER AND WILDLIFE AS PART OF A STRONG AND THRIVING ECONOMY SO THIS INFORMATION IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY BIRD SPECIES THAT ARE NATIVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MAMMALS SEVENTY FIVE AND VIVIAN SPECIES ALL HUNDRED MARINE FISH AND MARINE MAMMAL SPECIES IN OUR GREAT OCEAN OFF SHORE. YES SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PLANT TAX ON THIS STATE TWO THOUSAND OF THEM ARE RARE AND FOUND NO WHERE ELSE WE HAVE MORE. RARE PLANTS IN THIS STATE THAN ALL THE OTHER FORTY. A LOWER CONNELL STATE'S COMBINED. IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IT'S ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND LAKES AND RESERVOIRS ELEVEN HUNDRED MILE COASTLINE CALIFORNIA CURRENT OFF SHORE. IS THE DESERT'S A FARCE THE MEADOWS THE ESTUARIES THE RANGE LAND THE ACLAND ITS PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT CREATING A FUTURE THAT'S ALL INCLUSIVE AROUND THAT EXPERIENCE OF NATURE AS PART OF IT INTER CONNECTED WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THAT'S TWO WE THINK WE ARE THE DEPARTMENT RELATIVE TO OUR MISSION. SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS LETTING US. USE DATA TO IDENTIFY HOW TO DO GOVERNMENT BETTER. HOW TO BUILD OUR BUDGET MORE SMARTLY AND HOW TO CREATE THAT KIND OF FUTURE. THAT'S MY UPDATE ON THIS INFORMATION A LOT OF. WILL PROBABLY JUMP INTO IT WHEN WE GET TO OUR ITEMS LET'S. SEE TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN THIS IS OUR- THE NON CONTROVERSIAL HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND TRANSFER. WE ARE HERE WE GO AGAIN. IT'S JUST THAT WAS JUST. YEAH RIGHT. SO CHAIR MEMBERS WE TRY SOMETHING UNUSUAL. AND JUST START WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. I KNOW. THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THAT'S THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ASSEMBLY YESTERDAY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I TOOK SOME VERY DIRECT AND SHARP QUESTIONS APPROPRIATELY. SELECT COMMITTEE. I UNDERSTAND I ACKNOWLEDGE THE REACTION THAT THE FUNDS WHAT HAS TRIGGERED GET THAT. BUT I'D LIKE TO DO FIRST THOUGH KNOWING THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUES JUST KIND OF LAY OUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROPOSAL IF THAT'S OKAY. YEAH THAT'S ALL RIGHT WE SORT OF WENT THROUGH THIS THREE YEARS AGO YES HIGHER FUN BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT. THAT THAT IS VERY MUCH FOR ME I MEAN I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS WITH TIRE FUND WITH MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TO IT WAS CENTER MCGUIRE AND YOU ONE RAISING COME FISHING FEES I MAY HAVE A. FEEL FOR. THIS IS LIVE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DETRACT. THIS THAT'S- WITHIN THE- I THINK VERY REMARKABLE PROPOSAL. IN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET IT'S ABOUT. DATE IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO CREATE THAT VISION IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO CREATE THAT CALIFORNIA THAT'S NATURE FOR ALL IN HERE'S HOW IT'S ABOUT THOSE THINGS I'M DIRECTOR BONTA MIKE I SUSPECTED SOME OF MY MEMBERS HERE WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OF FINANCE BECAUSE WELL WE KNOW THAT SUBSTANTIVELY YOU HAVE THE PROGRAMS THE TECHNIQUE OF HAVING AS- OF ACQUIRING THE MONEY IS THE FINANCE ACTIVITY SO PLEASE PROCEED. SO THE PROPOSAL IS AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION AND FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS WHY THOSE NUMBERS. IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SEE THAT THERE'S A APPENDIX. THAT APPENDIX IS A SERIES OF ADDITIONAL DATA WE PULLED OUT OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING RESULTS. THE FOCUS IS ON THOSE TWO BIGGEST GAPS. AND THEN THINKS ABOUT THE STAFF HOURS IN THE MISSION HOURS RELATED TO WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS BCP. SO THAT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION LET'S SEND TO THREE THINGS. HERE'S MY FIRST MESSAGE. ANY MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME NO REGRETS SMART INVESTMENTS AWAY TO SHRINK YOUR GAP. CAN BE THINGS OTHER THAN LABOR SO WE WANT TO USE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THREE WAYS MODERNIZE OUR HATCHERIES SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE CAN BY EIGHTEEN EXHORTING MACHINES AND INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCIES ON DEALING WITH OUR HATCHERY FISH WE CAN BY FORTY. BY READING SMALL THREE HATCHERY TRUCKS WHICH ARE MORE MODERN REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS FROM A VEHICLE FLEET AND INCREASE THE SURVIVABILITY OF THE FISH WERE TAKING OUT THE WATERS FOR YOUNG KIDS TO FISH FOR. WE'D LIKE TO TAKE. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A MODERNIZE OUR WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS THE MANAGER WETLANDS AND ALSO FOR NOT CONNORS HERE'S HOW. WE WANT TO FIFTEEN PROJECTS AND CONVERT ALL DIESEL PUMPS TO SOLAR ARRAYS TO MANAGE OUR PUMPS ON OUR OWN LANDS AT SMART. IN WE WOULD LIKE TO BUY SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE MODERN EQUIPMENT SHRINKS ARE MAINTENANCE COSTS REDUCES OUR MISSIONS IN OUR EQUIPMENT FLEET ALLOWS US TO MANAGE OUR WETLANDS BETTER. LAST THING WE LIKE TO DO IS INVEST IN A PLAN WE HAVE SEVEN PLANES IN OUR FLEET SIX OF THEM WERE PURCHASED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. WITH A FIXED WING SPECIAL CONFIGURATION PLANE. WE CAN HAVE EYES IN THE AIR. AND MONITOR WELLS IN THE OCEAN. AND HELP OUR HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN CATCH CRAB IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS MARINE MALE MAMMAL ENTANGLEMENTS. THAT'S THE FIRST CATEGORY ONE TIME INVESTMENT IS NOT LABOR SMART. INVESTMENTS FROM WHERE WE SIT. NEXT ASPECT PROGRAM. TAKE EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION THIS IS THE CONNECTION TO THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND MECHANISM DISCUSSION BUT ON THE SUBSTANCE. PUT THAT MONEY ACROSS THREE THINGS FIRST AND INVESTMENT IN BIODIVERSITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY. SEVEN POSITIONS ONE POINT NINE MILLION WE OWN A MILLION ACRES IN THE STATE. AND WE MANAGE THOSE PROPERTIES. WE WANT TO DO CLIMATE RESILIENCY ASSESSMENTS ON THOSE PROPERTIES BECAUSE WE THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE ONE IN YOUR DISTRICT CHAIR WHERE YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN SEEN IF WE WERE STORE PROPERTIES ALONG THE BAY SHORE. WITH LOCAL PARTNERS IN GOVERNMENT WE CAN USE OUR WETLANDS AND OUR PROPERTIES AS FEE LEVEL RISE BUFFER AND ADAPTATION PROPERTY. WE THINK THAT OPPORTUNITY EXISTS ALONG THE COAST. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE ON THIS LAND BASE BUT A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE NOT OUR TRADITIONAL CUSTOMERS HUNTERS AND ANGLERS DON'T REALIZE WE HAVE. WE WANT TO OPEN IT UP. TO A WHOLE NEW SWATH OF CALIFORNIA THAT REFLECTS AN INCLUSIVE APPROACH. TO THE USE OF OUR LANDS IN AREAS AROUND LA AND SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO WE THINK THAT'S A GREAT FUTURE. THIS INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW US TO EXPLOIT CITIZEN SCIENCE IN INCOME TARLY DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE CURRENTLY DO. USING TOOLS LIKE AYE NATURALIST IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT ON OUR PROPERTIES HELPING US BE BOTANISTS. THE NEXT CATEGORY CUTTING GREEN TAPE WE'D LIKE TO TAKE FIFTEEN POSITIONS THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND CREATE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO OREGON AND COASTAL STREAMS BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING SALMON BACK IN THOSE WATERWAYS WE HAVE PROGRESSIVE TIMBER COMPANIES. PARTNERSHIPS WITH TRIBES PROGRESSIVE WATER AGENCIES LIKE CINEMA COUNTY AND A SWEET A CONSERVATION GROUPS I WANT TO PUT IN ONE PLACE LAWYERS GRANT MAKERS PERIMETERS PLANNERS AND GO TO SCALE AND PACE ON RESTORATION PROJECTS BY CUTTING THE BARRIERS WE PUT IN THE WAY. LAST CATEGORY. MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN MY CAREER. THIRTY ONE PEOPLE AND TEN POINT SEVEN Mà. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROGRAM. WE HAVE ABOUT THREE FOUR FIVE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WORKING IN THAT WHOLE PROGRAM THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEGALLY PROTECTED STATE LISTED ANIMALS AND PLANTS. JUST IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN NORTH OF THE DOZEN NEW PETITIONS WE'VE GOT A PROCESS. WE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP ON THE LISTING SIDE AND WE ARE FORGETTING ABOUT HOW DO YOU BRING THEM BACK. WITH THAT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT PEOPLE LONG COLLABORATIVE CONSERVATION SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS WERE. CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR ANIMALS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO YET LIKE MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE BOBCATS THE THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT CHANGES THE GAME FOR US. THE LAST ASPECT. BACK IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU APPROVED AN AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY POSITIONS WHILE OF THOSE HAVE AN EXPIRED YET THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WE KNOW ENOUGH THAT INVESTMENT PRODUCE SUCH GOOD RETURNS GO AHEAD MAKE IT PERMANENT. THAT'S MY PITCH. A SALES JOB I THINK IT'S A STRONG PROPOSAL THIS ONE I HAVEN'T SEEN YET IN MY CAREER IN THE NINE YEARS AS DIRECTOR SO I'M APPRECIATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. WE HEAR THESE RUMORS OF ALL THESE FEDERAL WORKERS THAT USED TO WORK ON ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR APPOINTMENTS THEY TO CALIFORNIA. I'M LA YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON WHETHER THESE. ARE BUSTER WELL. ADDRESSING ARE A I'M DEFICIENCIES FOR AWHILE HARD WE DO INDEED HAVE SOMETHING I RACHEL A WITH THE IN OFFICE SO AS THE AD DIRECTOR NOTED AND AT THE TOP OF YOUR CHEN ON PAGE ELEVEN THERE THREE COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL SO THE FIRST THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND BASICALLY TO. THE QUICK MEN AND INCREASE EFFICIENCIES WE THINK THAT'S WELL TARGETED AND TIME AND WOULD BE HELPFUL AND HELPING TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS THAT WERE SHOWN AB THREE ONE TIME FUND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT TWENTY MILLION FOR THE SECOND PIECE FOR THE ON GOING WE DO THINK THE PROPOSALS- ARE WELL TARGETED AT AT IDENTIFIED NEEDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IT'S JUST THE FUNDING SOURCES AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO. OUT COMES WITH TRADE OFFS SO WE DON'T HAVE A SILVER BULLET EASY ANSWER FOR YOU ON THIS WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS ONE WOULD BE TO APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE SHIFTING FUNDING AWAY FROM THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AND SO IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE OF CONSERVATION IT OFF YOU CAN JUST PRO RATE. GEN FUND INSTEAD BUT AND OF COMES WITH GENERAL FUND TRADE OFF YOU COULD AT FIVE A POOR OF THE PROPOSED RATHER THE FULL NINETEEN IN IF THERE SIR HOME AND YOU THINK FOR HIGHER AUTHORITY AND YOU EITHER OF SOURCE THAT CREATES LESS OF A FUNDING TRADE OFF BUT YOU'RE NOT CLOSING THOSE GAPS AS MUCH AND THEN THE FOURTH OF WHICH IS BE TO AND WAIT UNTIL. YEAR IN YOU'VE GOT THE FORMER OF THE SERVICE BUDGET AND THE REVENUE ASSURANCE PREGNANCY IF OUR OTHER FINDINGS YOU THANK YOU. THEN. THIRTY IN OF THE PROPOSAL WHICH ACTING NOW. TO FUNDING FOR. YOUR PLAY ONE TO A- THE FUNDING SHORTFALLS THAT WE KNOW COME BECAUSE- FUNDS PROVIDED FROM THE FOR. YEAR IN EIGHTEEN NINETY. WOULD RECOMMEND ROOF AT DIFFERING ACTION ON THAT UNTIL NOW. YEAR IN THE TO. REAL NEEDS BE MADE. I'M PART OF THE RE THE LET. ON PROVIDE FUNDING FOR YEARS BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THE SERVICE BASE BUT- OF. MAKING A FALL ON GOING I'M DECISION ABOUT FUNDING AND THE PEACE THAT WE DON'T HAVE YET OF THE ANALYSIS IS THE MONEY PEACE WE HAVE THE SERVICE PEACE BUT NOT THAT PIECE OF. OUR HOW MUCH REVENUE COMES FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES HOW DID THOSE PLAN WHAT WHAT ROLE IS PAID BY RATE PAYERS WHAT ROLES. BE PLAYED BY THE GENERAL FUND. SO WE THINK. THAT FULL ANALYSIS WOULD BE HELPFUL BEFORE YOU MAY HAVE THOSE I'M GOING DECISIONS ON ON DRESSING UP ONLY WILL. NEED TO BE A NEXT. YOU HAVE ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. FINANCING TWENTY FOUR. SINCE YOU WERE. A FRIEND THE ASSEMBLY SITE. SOME FULL SEARCHING PUT. YOU HAVE TO SIT TODAY. SO RIGHT. AT MY- BUT PAUL. ALL UP. YEAH BUT. BOTH YOU. I KNOW. IT IS ON IT THE GENERAL FUND. I HAVE A. IN LOOKING AT WHAT. YOU AT. I'M THAT I'M GOING WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHAT IN EARLY AND WE- AND I. MORE ME IT. YEAH NOTING THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER. WE'LL WORK IN THE IN THE YEAH. WELL LET REASON FOR. THE OTHER. ALRP BUT I. ANNUAL THERE'S- YEAH DO YOU I AND NOTING THAT THAT WHEN THE THERE KNOWLEDGE THERE'S- YEAH. I ALL RIGHT BUT- YEAH. AND ON THE OTHER BUILDING THE OTHER BUILDING. YEAH FUND OWN IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO BE. ONE OR THE OTHER REVENUE. BUT THAT. RIGHT AND IT BILL WOULD OUT OF IT. IN ALL OF. YEAH WHEN IT. I THINK THAT- AND THAT FUNDING TO HELP OR. WORK TO BOND TALKED ABOUT- SEA LEVEL RISE SOME PLANNING AND OUR WETLAND AREAS WE HAVE IN YOUR BUDGET YOU HAVE THESE REGIONAL. I AGENCIES THAT YOU WANNA ADD TO SET UP THE TO THE GOVERNOR'S COME UP WITH AND WE HAVE THESE MARKERS THESE. THESE GROUPS THAT HAVE SOARED ORGANICALLY SPRUNG UP I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T. HIT THE WHOLE. STATE BUT THEY HAVE BASICALLY A SERVICE PLANNING ASSISTANCE- A PLANNING COORDINATORS TO HELP AGENCIES COMMAND OR- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COME AND HELP THEM WITH SOME. INFORMATION WHY WOULD IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT IS SORT OF WORKING WITH THAT CROWD OR OR POTENTIALLY COULD WORK WITH THAT CROWD I COULDN'T WHY IS THAT NOT INCORPORATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THESE YOU KNOW THIS SETTING UP THIS NEW AGENCY OR THESE NEW IN THE DEPARTMENT WE ALREADY. HAVE IN. WHEN CONSERVATION IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CLIMATE ARENAS BUT AT. YEAH RIGHT. WATER. ALL. NO NO I'M JUST I GET THAT IS JUST THE PIECE THAT THAT THE FISH WHILE IT IS GONNA DO SAME THING SAME PLANNING DOCUMENTS SAME THING YOU ONE LIQUID CINEMA COUNTY OR LOS ANGELES OR SANTA CRUZ FAME LOCALITIES SAME COUNTY SO YOU GET IN THAT YOU YOU YOU BRING THEM TOGETHER IT WOULD SEEM. AS THOUGH. YOU WANT TO DO IT YOUR WAY INSTEAD OF THE WAY THAT. THE PUBLIC IS SORT OF HAS RESPONDED IN THE OUR CLIMATE CHALLENGES JUST SOMETHING YOU MY WANT TO GO BACK WHEN. WHEN YOU GO BOUNCE. WE ARE DOWNSTAIRS SO WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE OFFICE. MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS CENTER REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE THAT THE ATTENTION TO THE SENATE A FEW ITEMS BEFORE GETTING TO THE ACTUAL FIND ITSELF FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO TAKE KNOWLEDGE AT THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE I THINK OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING- IN RECENT MEMORY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THERE HAS BEEN- CRISIS AFTER CRISIS WHETHER IT'S ISSUES OF CRAB pWANTED KNOWLEDGE THE DIRECTORS ARTWORK- IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO WRANGLE A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF OPINIONS. I AND I ALSO IN GRATEFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT MOVING FORWARD. ON THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING I THINK THAT'S GONNA ONE BE POWERFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND ALSO TO THE PUBLIC INTO THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT DID THAT RELY. ON A TRANSPARENT BUDGET. IN BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW WHAT'S BEING CHARGE WHAT'S NOT TO EACH OF THE ACCOUNTS. I WANT TO. FOCUS ON A WORD THAT THE DIRECTOR USED AND I'M GONNA USE IT IS WELL THAT'S REMARKABLE. THANK IS REMARKABLE WE'RE BACK HERE AFTER WE HAD MADE A DEAL LAST YEAR EXTEND THE SUNSET FOR TEN YEARS AND I. WE HAVE TO KEEP IS THE HOME PLACE. AND WHERE I HAVE FELT FRUSTRATED. THAT MIGHT LIMITED FIVE YEARS SINCE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT COMES IN NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES. I'M WE DON'T DEPEND ON THE GENERAL FUND. WHERE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE FUND SOURCE. WE DON'T DO THAT WITH MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS BUT WITH STATE PARKS WITH BERMAN FISH AND WILDLIFE THIS BUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. IN USE THE GENERAL FUND. SO I'LL WRAP IT UP HERE AND SAY THIS I THINK THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE DIRECTOR WHETHER IT'S THE NEW AIRCRAFT THAT WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE CRAFT LEE AND POTENTIAL ENTANGLEMENT IT'S JUST BE HONEST THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THIS OUT OF ONGOING LITIGATION- N. ESPECIALLY A- PAIR OF THE FED'S. CRITICAL I'M ON THE ISSUES OF THE NEW FISH HATCHERY EQUIPMENT. THAT'S DATA DRIVEN WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS ANTIQUATED. I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THAT. I JUST HAVE ISSUES WITH THE RATING OF THE EIGHT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE. MILLION WE EXTENDED THE SUNSET BY AN ADDITIONAL DECADE LAST YEAR. FIND HAS BEEN RESULTS DRIVEN IN IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE. IN THIS RATING IS GOING TO IMPACT CONSERVANCY'S. IT'S GOING TO IMPACT LOCAL AND STATE PARKS IN HABITAT PROTECTION PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S SHORT SIGHTED. AND I ALSO BELIEVE IT SKIRTS THE LAW I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA COME BACK. FOCUS ON THE GENERAL FUND I DO WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO. FIND THE PROGRAMS THAT THE DIRECTOR PARTICULARLY HIGHLIGHTED I KNOW THAT I'M NOT GONNA YES THEY ASK ANY QUESTIONS- BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S WE'RE GONNA AGREE BUT I DO APPRECIATE PART OF FINANCE- BRING THIS FORTY NINE. AIR HOLDING IT OPEN TODAY THUNDERSTORMS. RIGHT. ALLEN. THIS. YEAH I GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCALE. AND THIS IS PROBABLY A. BENCHMARKED AGAINST WHAT'S SLIDE SIX IN THE HANDOUT RIGHT THAT'S THE BLUE GRAPHS. OR. SO YOU SEE NUMBERS FOUR X. THREE X. ONE AX MEN THAT SO JUST AS A REFERENCE POINT OUR CURRENT EMPLOYEE BASE IS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO EMPLOYEES. AND OUR CURRENT PROPOSED BUDGET IS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. HI BUT LET'S BE HONEST. I MEAN YOU CAN HOW WOULD YOU TAKE SIX HUNDRED MILLION AGO FOR ACTS. SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES SENATOR STERN RIGHT NOW IS THIS KIND OF. FINISHING UP SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. A MOMENT IN TIME THE ANNUAL BUDGET CYCLE DON'T ALWAYS SYNC. SO IN MY JUDGMENT A DECISION WE ADVOCATED AT THE DEPARTMENTS WE KNOW ENOUGH FROM THAT FIRST YEAR INCREDIBLE DATA SAID WE'VE NEVER HAD. EXACTLY AND THEN YOU OVER TIME HOPEFULLY WE BUILD A GROUND SWELL OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO REALIZE THIS IS PART OF THEIR FUTURE ENVISIONED TO AN I DESCRIBE A SEVENTY YEAR JOURNEY. STARTING BACK TO AT LEAST NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHEN YOU RECEIVED ADVICE FROM A NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM. THE PROBLEM EXISTED. YEAH. YEAH YES A- AFTER YOU WERE. ISSUE THE. THANK YOU. AUTHOR WATER AT. THIS IS ABOUT. YEAH. OUR IS. THREE EIGHT AND THAT. FIVE FIVE. BOTTOM. ALL OF. EIGHT OUT. YEAH. ALLEN HOW. I AM. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH A NUMBER BACK. I HAD A ANOTHER. ALL I. YEAH OUR. THIS I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE WATER. AT. AN EARLY IF SOMEONE. ASIAN. HOW DO YOU FIND A SERVICE CATEGORY. IT YES. YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEACH. YES OUT. HERE DO YOU. HAVE YES WHAT IS THE FAILURE LOW BY IS FAILURE WITH. WE YES SO I DON'T THINK WE DEFINE OUR MISSION BY. THE COST OF DOING NOTHING EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE THERE'S A LEGITIMATE. COST OF DOING NOTHING. THERE'S AN ACTUAL DEFINITION WE USED WITHIN SERVICE BASED PLEDGING STUFF BY MISSION I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO MAKE SURE I GET THE WORDS WE USE WITH DEVOID AND SEND IT BUT HERE'S THE SPIRIT. MISSION WAS. LOOK AT ALL YOUR STATUTES ARE YOUR REGULATIONS. OF ALL YOUR POLICIES. THINK ABOUT BASS SCIENCE RELATIVE TO ACHIEVING THOSE ASSIGNMENTS. THINK ABOUT THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF DOING THIS IN A PLACE AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. TRY TO MAKE A PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT ON YOUR CONSTITUENT EXPECTATIONS RELATIVE TO ALL THOSE THINGS. AND THEN PUSH THAT INTO THE QUANTIFICATION OF HOW MANY LABOR HOURS YOU WOULD NEED IF YOU WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT. YES YEAH YES I GIVE YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE EN. I THINK IT'S ONE THAT'S RELEVANT BUT I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME OFF AS PANDERING. WE HAVEN'T DONE. COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW MANY M. OUTLINES WE HAVE IN THE STATE WE HAVE A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC A WORK UNDER WAY DO MORE MODERN POPULATION MODEL. THAT POPULATION MODEL WOULD TELL US WHAT THE POPULATION SIZE MIGHT BE RELATIVE TO SUB POPULATIONS. COULD BE A PATHWAYS SCIENTIFICALLY TO UNDERSTAND THE DIET OF THE ANIMALS IN DIFFERENT PLACES JACK'S EX SCIENTIFICALLY IS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND RODENTICIDE IN OTHER ASPECTS THAT ARECONTRIBUTING TO MORTALITY. ONCE YOU HAVE A POPULATION SIZE KIND OF CREDIBLE APPROACHED UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN BACK YOURSELF INTO TRANSPORTATION INTERFACE AND TRY TO MAP OUT THE HOT SPOTS WHERE AN ANIMAL'S INTERFACING WITH YOU KNOW LACK OF WILDLIFE CORRIDORS. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE SPECIES THE KIND OF. SURVEY COMMITMENT ENERGY WE WOULD DO SCIENTIFICALLY THAT THEN IS THE PLATFORM FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON HOW DO YOU LIVE IN HABITAT WITH WILD ANIMALS AND MANAGE YOUR TRASH. HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND PRE DEPLOYING. A SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO TRANQUILIZE ANIMALS AS PART OF YOUR TRANS RELOCATION STRATEGY DO YOU NEED TEN CAGES OR HUNDRED CAGES DEPLOYED ROUNDS HOW DO YOU ENGAGE IN. THIS THAT OR THE OTHER THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF MISSION LEVEL WORK AROUND ONE CORNERSTONE SPECIES. IF. ALTHOUGH. MISSION AT. RELATIVE TO IN SERVICE BASED BUDGETING REMEMBER THAT TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TASKS. WE TOOK THESE EIGHT SERVICE LEVELS AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT TO ACHIEVE THAT. JACK DESERVE WHAT ARE THE TASK GOING ON FROM. LET'S SAY PUBLIC USE AND ENJOYMENT. ACCESS ACCESS DAHLE EIGHTY EIGHT. WHAT ARE THE TEMPORE DONDE. SHOULD THE REST WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT TO THE PAPER IN THE RESTROOM AT A TASK LEVEL. ALL THAT IN THE ROSTER OF THREE THOUSAND TO FIGURE OUT THE SERVICE AREA TO GET YOU TO THE SLIDE WHICH IS YOU JUST USING THE LABOR OUR METRIC. IT SHOWS YOU THE GAP. YEAH. BACK. HERE. NOW. I DON'T. OVER. UNDER. HOW YEAH. ONE MAYBE I. LAST I AM AS IN. THOUSANDS. ORDER YEAH. THANK YOU. ON. ONE ONE. YEAH. I KNOW THERE'S REVENUE OR I. HOUSING IT. I AM. WORLD. I STIR DOLLY. ALL. I. YEAH AND YOUR. HE ABOUT WHERE. IS IT IS IT. WE ARE NOT. YES SO HERE'S MY SNAPSHOT OF ONE OF THE THINGS WILL BE. COMING BACK TO YOU AFTER WE DO THE NEXT CLICK OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. WE HAVE AN ACCOUNT AT THE DEPARTMENT IT'S CALLED THE MISSION GAME PRESERVATION FUND. IT LITERALLY IS ONE OF THE OLDEST ACCOUNTS IN THE STATE TREASURY I THINK IT'S NINETEEN OH THREE NINETEEN OH NINE. IT HAS TWO BLOCKS ONE IS WHAT WE CALL DEDICATED THERE ARE TWENTY NINE SUB ACCOUNTS. PEOPLE HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY UNTRUSTWORTHY THE DEPARTMENT AS A STAKEHOLDER WHEN I WAS IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD I'D COME HERE AND SAY I WANT SOME REVENUE BUT I WANT TO PUT IN AND A DEDICATED ACCOUNT. SO WE'VE GOT A WHILE PIC ACCOUNT TO DUCK ACCOUNT. THEY ARE VERY STRICT THEIR CONTROLLED. THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS FUND IS NON DEDICATED. WHAT GOES INTO THAT ARE THE REVENUES FROM THE ENTITLEMENT THE LICENSE THE HUNTER AND THE ANGLER BY. AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE GOT THIS FUND COSTS ARE GOING UP SALARIES APPROPRIATELY AND WE'RE OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION KNOCK ON WOOD YOU KNOW WE CAN SPEND IN WAYS WE COULDN'T. AND THERE'S A PERPETUAL EVERY COUPLE YEARS YOU GET IN ABOUT. COMPOUNDED BY. WE'RE LOSING HUNTERS AND ANGLERS SO THERE'S LESS GOING IN. AND IT ULTIMATELY COMES BACK TO THE CONVERSATION YOU BEEN HAVING WHAT'S THE ASSEMBLAGE OF CERTAIN REVENUE STREAMS BECAUSE NO ONE STREAM COULD EVER CARRY THE FULL LOAD AND IS THERE AN ADDITIVE COMPONENT THAT HELPS YOU ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING THAT'S THE BASIC. THING THAT'S BEEN IN DISCUSSION FOR ALL TIME NOT BEEN DIRECTOR. WHO IS THAT BEING ANALYZED IN THIS. YES WE WILL START REAR IS OUT SOME THREE YEAR PROCESS BUT IT'S NOT IN THIS YEAR HAVE YOU SEE NOW IS THE RAW DATA. ON JUST ARE ARE THEY NEED FORCED LABOR IN THE NEED NOW YOU'RE GONNA PLUG IN THE WHAT REVENUES YOU HAVE ON WHERE THEY COME FROM. AND WHERE THEY'RE DEDICATED TO AND IN THAT THAT PROCESS WILL FINISH UP IN THIS NEXT. YEAR THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THE- THIRTEEN. ARE HAVE A CONSERVATION FUND AND BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO N. I'M REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS HAD TODAY- AND I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY ONE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DEAL THAT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT IS WHAT THE CURRENT STATUTE SAYS NOW AND I JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE HE CHAMPION THIS ISSUE WITH HIS BILL AND- AS BEFORE SEVENTY FOUR LAST YEAR AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE FINE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE. ON THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY ONE ON WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THE- THAT YOU REJECT THE TRAILER BILL WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS ESSENTIALLY ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL AND I THINK YOU KNOW TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MOUNTAIN LION IT'S LIKE ASKING TO SAY WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY TO A HIGHER AMOUNT LINE HAPPENED INSTEAD PAVE OUTLINED BY ALL STE BUT FRANKLY IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE- YOU KNOW THE- BIODIVERSITY DECLINE WE'RE HAVING. TO CALIFORNIA ALL OF THE OF. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IT WOULD- THE PROPOSAL WOULD DELETE. MONEY MOVING FORWARD AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT NOT ONLY FUNDS THE WCG BUT IT'S MONEY THAT WOULD FUND THAT WITH THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. STATE PARKS AND WOULD PROVIDE- GRANTS FOR LOCAL PARK DISTRICTS. SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND FOR THE W. C. B. PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO BE. AT THAT'S- I KNOW DOLLARS THAT GO TO ACQUIRE ABOUT LION HABITAT. OAK WOODLANDS RIPARIAN HABITAT. AND FOR MY FRIENDS THAT WORK IN THE- WHAT MIGRATORY. BIRD IN THE WATER FOUL WORLD. THAT CUTS THE FUNDS THE INLAND WETLANDS PROGRAM WHICH IS CRITICAL AS PART OF THEIR WORK WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY JOINT VENTURE. SO THESE ARE ALL PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. AND WOULD REALLY BE INJURED BY YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD ALSO NOTE. THAT IT IS ACTUALLY ANTITHETICAL TO THE ENTIRE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EFFORT TO HAVE COME. TO THE PROPOSAL LIKE THIS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY SAYING WILL BE JUST GONNA SHIFT. IN POINT NINE DOLLARS FOR THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR. BUT THEN THEY'RE GONNA CUT THE REST THE- FUNDING TOGETHER. IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. WAS SOMETHING. AND ASSEMBLY THAT MONEY. INTO THE FIND. MAY OR MAY NOT. TURN TO PAR. ONE LATE. FOR THERE'S A- TURN. AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE. USUALLY LAST LINE FORGETTING. CHEN FUND. AND WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT I'M ALSO. ABOUT THE- AT W. B. AND THE FACT THAT A BUNCH OF MONEY SO THEY CAN JUST YOU KNOW PROP UP THE MONEY THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEND MONEY TO THROUGH THE H. C. F. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE W. CD'S. CF FIND IS SPENT ACT. EVERY YEAR IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT MONEY THAT SITS AROUND THAT'S MONEY THAT CRANKS OUT VERY QUICKLY AND GOES TO THE AREAS THAT NEED IT AND A LOT TIMES AREAS THAT DON'T BENEFIT FROM BOND FUNDING. BUT FRANKLY. I'M LIKE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND NOT SOME OF THE MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK IS ALSO- SO REJECT THE TRAILER BILL BUT HOLD OPEN THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. I WOULD AGREE THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THE EXTENSION OF THE THIRTY MILLION THAT WAS PROMISED DURING THE LAST BUDGET DEAL VERY IMPORTANT. EIGHTEEN TWO POINT NINE MILLION FOR THE THREE PROGRAMS THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS TO. I COULDN'T SIT HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND TELL YOU. THE THIRTY ONE NEW POSITIONS. AT THE IN ANY DANGER SPECIES PROGRAM WOULDN'T BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL. FOR LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE WORK ON WOLVES. THE AMOUNT LINES IF THEY'RE LISTED. ALL OF THEM AND MANY OTHER SPECIES THAT ARE LISTED NOW OR ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE LISTED IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED THOSE BIOLOGISTS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY. RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS ONLY FIVE. PEOPLE WHO ARE CATERED 100% WORKING IN DANGER SPECIES PROGRAM. WHICH IS CRAZY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THAT SHOULD BE AUGMENTED. THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND IS NOT THE PLACE TO BE LOOKING FOR THE FUNDING. THANK YOU. TAX GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION AND I. I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR STERN AND THE DIRECTOR- IN RELATION TO A SERIES OF- SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN LION- ISSUES THAT HAVE. CATAPULTED AND TO THE PUBLIC'S CONCERN OVER THE LAST MONTH OR SO AND I JUST WANT TO THANK BOTH OF THEM FOR. THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND THERE ARE. THE POLICY CHANGES IN THE RESPONSE THAT'S BEEN SWIFTER THAT I HOPE WE DEEPLY HOPE AT THE MOUNT LINE FOUNDATION ARE GOING TO PUT MOUNT LANDS ON A PATH TO. DECREASE MORE BUT HE AN INCREASE LEGAL PROTECTIONS- AND AS THE- IN A POP WHEN SEVENTEEN WHICH CREE. THE HABITAT. FUND I'LL I'LL SECOND KIM'S REMARKS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT THAT FUND MAKES- PARTICULARLY FOR MOUNTAIN LIONS. BUT I WANT TO URGE REJECTION ON LEGAL GROUNDS I'M CONCERNS AS THE DRAFTERS OF THE MEASURE. THAT AMENDMENTS ARE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE MEASURE TO FURTHER THE PURPOSE AND INTENT. OF THE PROPOSITION WHICH WE WOULD SUBMIT. RATING TAKING AWAY THE FUND- DOES NOT SERVE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE INITIATIVE ONLY ALLOWS FOR EXTENDING REPEALING THE END DATE. OF THE FIND IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR ELIMINATING IT- AS PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND FINALLY OF THOSE WEREN'T SUFFICIENT LEGAL CONCERNS WE DO BELIEVE THIS WOULD AT A MINIMUM TRIGGERING FOR FIFTY VOTE- TO CHANGE HIS VOTE. OVER BY THEN IT AS- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ON A PATH TO APPROVING THAT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU LEGAL BACK. BACK FOR THAT DECISION THE GUARDS. I MYSELF WEARING WEARING THEIR TIME OF AN LED HAVOC.

AS OTHERS ARE BY THE DEPARTMENTS EMBRACE AND COMMITMENT TO THE SERVER SPACE BUDGET EFFORT. AND THAT PRELIMINARY INFORMATION IS OF COURSE SUPER CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TIME EXPERIENCE OF UNDERFUNDED MISS. BUT THE REAL PROMISE OF THE SERVICE BASE BUDGET IS TO BE ABLE TO KERN CREDIBLY SUBSTANTIATE AND QUANTIFY THE UNMET NEEDS. SO THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH NOTHING LESS THAN THE TRANSFORMATION. IN THE WAY THAT WE FUND FISH AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION BE OF DEEPLY UNDER INVESTED AND WE NEED THE S. P. TOOL TO GUIDE US SO. WITH RESPECT TO THE RAMS THAT ARE. FIGHTING THE B. C. P.

THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING A PUBLIC GARCIA WITH ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FIND WHAT. PEDRO SAID WE AGREE WITH.

AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO THAT I'M PARTICULARLY FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES FROM OTHER SOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WE WILL HOLD THIS MATTER MOVING ON ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN LINKS RUFUS. IN NON GAME SPECIES GO AHEAD DIRECTOR. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS TO EMPLOYMENT LAW PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTY FOUR. IT WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT WITH THREE POSITIONS AND ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO COMPLETE THE FIRST DESIGN AND POPULATION ASSESSMENT A MONITORING PROGRAM OF OUR BOBCAT POPULATION. THAT'S SIMPLE LA AREA REPORT NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL FINANCE. MEMBERS MEISTER DOLLY. CAN I KNOW THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED THAT WAS ABOUT HUNTING AND TRAPPING SO WHAT WHAT IS THIS MONEY TO BE SPENT FOR AND WHAT DO YOU TRY IT WHAT'S THE GOAL. WELL IT IS GOING TO BE. THE DIRECTIVE IN ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTY FOUR. WHICH SAYS UPON FUNDING DEPARTMENT SHALL DO THIS STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT A MONITORING PLAN THAT IS ALSO RELATED TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THIS IN THE BILL TWELVE FIFTY FOUR. WHICH SAYS THERE'S NO HUNTING OF BOB UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. UNLESS AND UNTIL. SUCH AN ASSESSMENT IS DONE THE ASSESSMENT IS BROUGHT BACK TO THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION GOES THROUGH A SUITE OF PUBLIC PROCESS SEES. DETERMINE WHETHER THERE SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE HUNTING. OKAY. UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A BOBCAT QUESTION. I WOULD. BUILDING ON SENATOR DOLLIES QUESTION. ARE YOU REALLY SORT OF FOCUSING IN ON THE UNLESS AND UNTIL HERE AND SPEEDING UP THAT PART OF IT LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE NEAR TERM WHAT'S THE RUSH NEAR TERM IN YOUR MIND TO PRIORITIZE THIS KIND OF EFFORT. WELL WE'VE GOT. NOT A NOT A- COMPLETE MORATORIUM BUT AT LEAST TO HAVE A PRETTY CLEAR SIGNAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW. THIS FITS IN. EACH YEAR THE DEPARTMENT GETS TYPICALLY A SWEET A NEW MANDATES. SOMETIMES THEY COME WITHOUT THE FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. I SUPPOSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A PERMANENT MORATORIUM BUT THE BILL IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT IN OUR JUDGMENT I RESPECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE NOT TO FUND THIS BUT FOR OUR PURPOSES LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT ASSIGNMENTS WE THANK YOU THINK YOU'RE LEGALLY COMPELLED TO DO THIS. OR IN IS IT IS IT IT'S MORE DISCRETIONARY IF YOUR GROUP GREAT QUESTION. I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO READ THE STATUTE WITH THAT QUESTION IN MY MIND. CONSULT WITH OUR GENERAL COUNSEL OFFICE AND GET BACK TO YOU. OKAY SO THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED WE HAD. I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE REVENUE FOR THE TAGS WE DIDN'T MEET DE AMOUNT IT WAS COSTING US TO. UPON THAT THE PROGRAM THAT WAS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS I ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL. BUT I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WASN'T. HUNTING ANYMORE AND ARE OR- SO WHAT WAS SO DO YOU THIS. TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ALMOST THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO. FIND OUT WHETHER WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOT OR NOT. ACCORDING TO THE NUMBERS OF THE POPULATION NOW. THIS INVESTMENT WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT WE HAVE AS THE BOBCATS HOW MANY WHERE HEALTH RISKS RED STABILITY INSTABILITY IT'S AN ASSESSMENT OF ALL THOSE POPULATION DYNAMICS. WE WOULD PRESENTED TO OUR COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO START HUNTING ON IT OR NOT. BASED ON THIS ASSEMBLY BILL. WE HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT AS I READ THE STATUTE TO COMPLETE THE STUDY UPON START ACTING HONOR START HUNTING ON IF HE SAID. THAT'S THE COMMITTEE CHAIR IS. ALL RIGHT HOW. AND YOUR QUESTION BEEN ANSWERED. OKAY SO THIS IS THIS IS A REQUEST FOR FUNDING TWO OR THREE POSITIONS FOR THE STATE WIDE MONITORING PLAN TO ASSESS THE BOBCAT POPULATION CORRECT. SENATE STERN. I WOULD JUST I APPRECIATE- THE CHAIR WANTS TO DO HERE I THINK. GIVEN ALL THE OTHER RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS I THINK IT IS. WORTH CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THIS IS ABSOLUTELY. NECESSARY WAY I READ THE LAWS THERE'S DISCRETION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERTAKE THIS ACTION I DON'T SEE THIS IS PARTICULARLY URGENT AT THE MOMENT. BUT YEAH I'M OPENED HOWEVER WE WANT TO PROCEED YOU ARE YOU YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO YOUR FOLKS AND TRY TO GET US ALL UP ON YOUR QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN BE DEFERRED TO ANOTHER IF IT UPCOMING AGENDA TO. TAKE ANOTHER LOOK OR- HE WON APPROACH BUT I WOULD LOVE THAT. LET'S HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC ANYBODY HERE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN THIS IS THE STATE WIDE BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION I DID HAVE PREPARED REMARKS WOULD BASED ON THE CONVERSATION I JUST WANTED TO COME UP AND SPIEGEL. ON THIS ISSUE SO WE WERE PART OF THE COALITION LAST YEAR THAT OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE. THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE BEST TO REMAIN VESTED WITH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. THERE VESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT GAME SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT I'M NOT STAYING HERE TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M DEFENDING THIS OR THE OTHER I HAVE NO INTEREST IN HUNTING BOBCAT AND WATER FELL WITHIN THE CLIENTS- BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT DO. AND THERE'S A BODY THAT'S APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR IT WORKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THE BASIS OF SCIENCE TO HELP MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR REMOVE THAT STORY FROM THEM WITH THIS BILL BUT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SO. PROCESS IN GENERAL. AS WE WENT THROUGH THE DOOR ON THIS BILL. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO DO THE SCIENCE FIRST. AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHETHER BàN WAS APPROPRIATE WE'RE GOING TO DO A BAND. AND THEN TRY TO FOLLOW AT THE SCIENCE SO WE SEE THIS AS- A LOGICAL CONCLUSION TO THE WAY THAT THE CHAIR OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MR PORTANTINO ALLOW THE BILL TO MOVE THROUGH HIS COMMITTEE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. SO WE WOULD ASK. THAT YOU APPROVE THE FUNDING SO THAT THE SCIENCE CAN BE DOWN AGAIN WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE PROCESS WAS DONE. BACKWARDS DOT NET SIGN SHOULD BE THE REASON WHY IN THE JUSTIFICATION WHY GAMES. MANAGEMENT IS CHANGING THE- SO CAN YOU WONDER WHY IS CALIFORNIA WATER FELL IF YOU'RE MAKING A COMMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SOMEBODY PROPOSED TO BAN DOVE HUNTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOHN NATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IN RIGHT SO THERE ARE THESE DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT TAKE PLACE. THAT CAN IMPACT SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN PRIORITIES RELATIVE TO OUR THREE THEY WANT TO GET MORE PEOPLE. FISHING AND HUNTING BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE FIRST ITEM THAT YOU CHATTED ABOUT- SO AGAIN WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BE HAPPY TO HAVE ANY OFF LINE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING IS SIR STAFFORD CONDITION IS TO APPROVE HIS BUDGET THE CHAIR IS. LEAVES IT'S APPROPRIATE I IN THE REMARKS THAT WERE MADE WE DO A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE FUNDING I THINK THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH THE- INFORMATION AND- WHAT'S THE BOBCAT POPULATION LOOKS THAT'S WHY WOULD BE REMAKE. AMENDING AND I BY SURE DOLLY- WITH THOSE REMARKS I'M GONNA CHANGE MY I WAS GONNA VOTE NOW BUT I'M GONNA HAVE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE I DO THINK IT IS BACKWARDS AND I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THATWE LEGISLATE BY MOTION NOT BY FAX. MOTION B GUYS SEND REQUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ACCOUNTS KING I NOT ONLY. WHERE RUNNING TURN. YEAH MATTER OPEN AND LOOKS AT SOME PEOPLE TO THE TABLE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN DEADLY FORCE TRAINING THIS IS FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION CAL FIRE IN PARKS AND RECREATION. THIS RESERVE MOBILE. TRAINING SIMULATORS AND. TRUCKS TO MOVE THOSE ARE VEHICLES TO MOVE THOSE. PLEASE PROCEED. SURE HE'S MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING. MY NAME IS DAVID BASS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND CHIEF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND I'LL LET MY TWO PARTNERS HERE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. SCOTT ELLIOTT A DEPUTY CHIEF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EMERGENCY SERVICES OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. HEY GOOD MORNING CHEN CUNNINGHAM ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FIRE PROTECTION OPERATIONS OF WHICH IS OUR CALPERS LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. SO THIS JOINT PROPOSAL WITH FROM RESOURCES AGENCY THAT INCLUDES OUR THREE DEPARTMENTS FISH AND WILDLIFE STATE PARKS AND CAL FIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS. OUR DRESSING OUR COLLECTIVE TRAINING NEEDS THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO MEET THE MANDATED LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF AB THREE NINETY TWO AND SB TWO THIRTY. NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCIES COMBINED LAW ENFORCEMENT STAFF IS THE SECOND LARGEST POLICE FORCE IN OUR STATE WITH TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE MOST CURRENT RELEVANT AND REALISTIC TRAINING AVAILABLE THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW US TO TRAIN OUR CURRENT STAFF AS WELL AS NEW RECRUITS. IN THE TACTICS OF DE ESCALATION ENGAGING WITH CONSTITUENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND UTILIZING THE USE OF FORCE MODEL IN ALIGNMENT WITH POST GUIDANCE. WITH THE UTILIZATION OF THE SIMULATORS INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL OUR DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO TRAIN OUR OFFICERS TO THE NEW STANDARD WHEN CONSIDERING A FORCE OPTION. ALL OF OUR COMBINED AGENCY TOTAL OF TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO PEEPS PEACE OFFICERS WILL NEED TO BE. RETRAINED REGARDING USE OF FORCE. IN ADDITION THE ITEMS IN THE PROPOSAL WILL GIVE US THE TOOLS NEEDED TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS COLLABORATIVE AND EFFICIENT TRAINING MODEL IN THE RESOURCES AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS ACROSS OUR THREE DEPARTMENTS. SPECIFICALLY COLLECTIVELY THE BUDGET ASK IT THE ASK IS SIX POSITIONS. THREE POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AN ON GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE TRAINING A POLICY COMPONENTS RELATED TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF DEADLY FORCE PURSUANT TO THE STATUTES. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TRAINING RESOURCES TO BE SHARED AMONG OUR THREE DEPARTMENTS. A STATIONARY LIVE FIRE TRAINING SIMULATOR WILL BE HOUSED WITH CAL FIRE INTO MOBILE TRAINING SIMULATORS ONE EACH FOR STATE PARKS AND FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. PERCENT OR IS THAT A GOOD I JOIN. JOINT I WAS A SALAMI ASK WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE SWORN OFFICERS HAVE TRAINING RIGHT NOW DON'T THEY GO TO A FACILITIES STATE FACILITY AND GET OPPOSE TRAINING THAT THEY THAT THEY-HAVE A CONTINUING POST TRAINING. YES WE DO QUARTERLY BUT WE DO NOT HAVE SIMULATIONS TRADE YOU KNOW SIMULATOR FOR SIMULATIONS TRAINING CURRENTLY RIGHT IN THE SO THE QUESTION IS THAT. WHEN WE'VE ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF FIVE HAVE. SCHOOLING THAT WE WANT PEOPLE HAVE ON DEADLY FORCE WHY COULDN'T THAT BE ACHIEVED IN. THE CLASSROOM SETTING. PLEASE GOOD QUESTION SURE- SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE AN ACADEMY SETTING WHERE WERE EITHER GETTING IT THROUGH A LECTURE MOSTLY THROUGH A LECTURE MAHLER WRITTEN MATERIAL INACADEMY SAID HE SETTING WE ALSO HAVE WHAT WE CALL SCENARIO BASED TRAINING WHERE WE TAKE PEOPLE OUT INTO THE FIELD ACTUALLY PUT THEM AND TRY TO REPLICATE SCENARIOS TO PUT THROUGH WHAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY ENCOUNTER IN THE FIELD. THIS THESE SIMULATORS WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THAT ANY USE OF FORCE MODEL. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE GOING OUT. SIMULATED THROUGH A CONTACT HOW TO USE OF FORCE DECISION TO MAKE WHERE THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT SOME DECISION MAKING AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY USE THEIR SERVICE WEAPON IN THE USE OF FORCE AN OREO. WHAT ARE OUR SISTER AGENCIES DOING ON THE SLOT ON THE EDUCATION OF YOU SOME FOR SOMETHING YOU SEE H. P. AND I GET IT THERE ARE SOME. I'M THINKING OF EUREKA WRITING YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF YOUR PEOPLE THERE AND THE C. H. P. AND STATE AGENTS THAT ARE UP THERE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE TRAINING PROPRANOLOL ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAL FIRE SIMULATORS HAD ONLY FOR CAL FIRES. EMPLOYEES. YES OUR EMPLOYEES- AS PART OF THEIR CORLEY TRAIN FOR INSTANCE IN EUREKA I DO HAVE SOME VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO SOME REGIONAL TRAINING CENTER THE COMPETITION FOR TIME WTHIN THOSE REGIONAL TRAINING CENTER FOR THINGS LIKE SIMULATORS. HIS HIGH AS WE ROLL THIS OUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH A SIMULATOR OR WERE PROPOSAL WE% HAVE ALTHOUGH IT IS A PORTION OF THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING. IT'S A TRAINING PROCESS WE'RE GOING THROUGH. FOLKS TRADITIONALLY LEARN BY LISTENING SEEN AND THEN DOING THE TRAINING SIMULATORS ALLOW AS TO THE REPETITION IN A TIME SAVINGS. FASHION WE CAN SET UP THE SCENARIOS RUNNING NEXT RECETA FROM THE STEREO. SB SO BY HAVING THE DEDICATED TRAIN AMONGST OUR THREE AGENCIES WERE ALLOWED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND WE'RE LED TO FOCUS ON THAT SPECIFIC TO OUR MISSION AND OUR UNIQUE WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH ALL THREE OF A SHARE COMPARED TO MAYBE A WORKING CONDITION FROM- MEANS OUT MUNICIPALITY OR COUNTY. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS SAID YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAVE SOME BIAS HERE I HAVE SOME BY AS THEY THINK THE EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IS A URBAN CITY. ROBIN BECAUSE THAT'S WE SEE IT I DO I DON'T REMEMBER THE- FISHERMEN AT BEING CONFRONTED WITH FISHING GAME IN A EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE SAID I'M SURE IT MUST HAPPEN IN THERE. IS JUST SOMETHING THAT'S JUST NOT NOT REPORTED SO I III. I UNDERSTAND THE STATUTE REQUIRES TRAINING FOR EVERYBODY I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH I HAVE THREE SIMULATORS. FOR THREE DEPARTMENTS AND WE TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE SO HERE. IS THERE IS THERE ECONOMY OF SCALE THAT. THE H. P. IN EUREKA WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR SIMILAR WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR TRAINING THERE OR THE SAID THE COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES. OR IS SEVEN FIVE AND FOR IT HAVE SIMULATORS FOR THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS AND A NEW SHINY SIMILAR IN MAINE I'M I GET IT THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE IN. THE EDUCATION BUT BUT WE WANT TO BE. CAREFUL ON HOW WE THAT EXPENDABLE. THE FUN SO THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF MY QUESTIONS ON THE WE HAVE AN ANSWER NOW IS IF. IF ALL OF A SUDDEN KNOCK KNOCK HEALDSBURG SAYS I WANT TO USE CAN WE USE OUR SIMILAR EXES ARE GUYS HE TO HAVE. A TRAINING AND YES IT MAY HAVE THE FISHERMEN IN THERE BUT IT'S JUST SEND ESSENTIALLY IS THE SAME USE OF FORCE. REQUIREMENT FROM MS WEBER AND- CENTER COUPLE EUROS. I HAD LEGISLATION IS IT TRANSIT- REUSABLE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IT IT'S ONLY SIMULATIONS ONLY IN EDUCATION RIGHT. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IT'S- YES MISTER DOES SO ON BEHALF OF MY DEPARTMENT I WOULD SAY WE ALWAYS WOULD WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NO CURRENTLY THERE'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN AGENCIES SO. CHIEF CUNNINGHAM IS CORRECT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF DEMAND. TO PUT PEOPLE THROUGH THE SIMULATION TRAINING AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST CURRENT STATE OF THE ART THE BILL TO SIMULATE AND GET THEM UP TO SPEED ON. THIS NEW USER FOR STANDARD. BUT I SURE DOLLY OUR- IN THE AT. BUT. ONE STATION. IN THE REPORT IT. ABLE TO UTILIZE THOSE. THERE'S BILL ANY. THAT. ONE NUMBER ONE OR SPENT THERE ARE. THESE YEAH HELLO YOU DO YOU AGREE THAT THIS IS RIGHT SIZE FOR THE TWELVE HUNDRED SWORN OFFICERS IN THESE THREE AGENCIES YEAH WE LOOKED AT THIS AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS AND- WE WERE HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT THEY'RE COMING FORTH TOGETHER WITH ONE B. C. B. WITH THE THREE AGENCIES AND HAVE A PLAN ALREADY TO TRY AND SHARE THE RESOURCES AT LEAST ACROSS THESE THREE YOUR POINT THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING BEYOND IS WELL TAKEN BUT FOR STARTING WITH THREE THAT'S A GOOD START TO BOTTOM. THIS CHAIR IS DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS. OUR WILDLIFE OFFICERS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WOULD BE COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO HAD A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. THESE OFFICERS HAVE DEPLOYED IN CRISIS INCIDENTS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENCES. ARE SWORN TO ENFORCE ALL OF THE- CRIMINAL CODE IN THE STATE BEYOND JUST FISHING GAME. I AS DIRECTOR WANT THEM FULLY TRAINED ON USE OF FORCE AND I ALSO ONE IS DEALING WITH IMPLIED BIAS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AFFECTING. POLICING IN THE MODERN ERA SO I APPRECIATE YOU ENTERTAINING THIS PROPOSAL. BY SURE DOLLY NO I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE- FUNDING UP THE TRAINING BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ON THE- THE FACILITY THERE OR THE MOBILE TRAINING. SO IS THIS. FOR LIKE FIRE OR IS THIS FOR LIKE ACTIVE SHOOTER TYPE THING. BECAUSE I WITH A SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S THEIR STATIONED ALL OVER THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY THEY HAD WHEN I HEAR ON THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS HAD WHEN I HEAR THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY. AS LEGISLATORS GOING IS THAT IS THAT THE KIND OF DEVICES OR IS THIS LIKE WHAT I SAW. AT THE CHP ACADEMY WHERE THEY HAVE YOU KNOWS THEY HAVE A SIMULATOR WHERE THERE SOMEBODY WITH YOUR YOUR WHERE IN THE USE OF FORCE SITUATION. UNDER THE- IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY THE CAL FIRE UNIT WOULD BE LIVE FIRED THE TWO MOBILE UNITS WOULD BE INFRARED. SIMULATORS THAT'S ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WELL I'M I'M TRYING TO. FORCE OR IF THIS IS PROVIDING FIRE LIKE IN A STRUCTURE. THIS THESE ARE USE OF FORCE AND- SO ARE THE LIVE FIRE SIMULATOR CURRENTLY SCHEDULE- PROPOSED TO GO TO CAL FIRES ACADEMY. IS A LIVE FIRE SIMULATOR SO OUR OFFICERS WOULD ENTER THE FRONT OF THE SIMULATOR SIMILARLY TO WHERE I'M DRESSED WITH THEIR ACTUAL DO TOGETHER ON AND BE ABLE TO PLAY THEIR FORCE OPTIONS AS APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE SCENARIOS OF BASS BASS. WITHIN THEIR- ENDED WITH IN THE SCENARIOS ARE INDIVIDUAL CONTACTS OF THE THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES WHICH PUT THOSE OFFICERS DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF THE NECESSITY OR OR LACK THEREOF TO. BE UTILIZED FOR. ELECTRONIC SIMULATORS WORK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE- TALKING ABOUT THE LIVE FIRE TRAINING SIMULATOR AND ITS LOCATION OF OFFER ATOMI. COMPLIMENTS ARE EXISTING TRAIN PLATFORMS THAT ARE BETTER SO WE CAN. RUN NUMEROUS STUDENTS THROUGH A FAST PACE TAKE THEM OUT BUT IN A MINUTE PUTTING THEM IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL SCENARIO BASED TRAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FACILITIES ARE TO DO IT. ANY ADDITIONAL RAIN SPACE. WE CAN SAFELY OPERATE MULTIPLE SCENARIOS AND RUN NUMEROUS STUDENTS THROUGH. AT ONE POINT- JUST MAKE SURE I'M TRACKING BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME TYPE OF THE SIMULATOR. BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU ALREADY HAVE SIMULATORS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO FIGHT FIRE DO STRUCTURE FIRE LIKE I SAW OUT HERE. YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE THAT IS A SIMULATOR THAT. THEY PUT YOU IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TO USE FORCE. THAT'S WAT THIS IS ABOUT. NOW MY THIRD QUESTION WOULD BE. DOES THE CHP OR- I'M ASSUMING THERE'S OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE THESE ALREADY OR THEY DO. SO THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER AND- USE THOSE OR IS IT ARE THESE MEANT IN IN MY MIND THAT. THE TAXPAYERS PAY IN. TWO FOUR C. H. P. FISHING GAME WARDEN YOU NAME IT YOU CAL FIRE. SO IT IS OUR LACK OF THESE OF AVAILABLE TO THOSE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE COULD USE WITH EACH OTHER OR IS THIS THE FIRST ONES OUT OF THE GATE. THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THERE ARE OTHER TRAIN SIMULATORS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES OR REGIONAL TRAINING CENTERS. THE NUMBER OF THOSE QUALITY OF THOSE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE. AS WE PROGRESS FORWARD OUR BEHIND SO THAT'S WHY WE IS A AGENCIES- AS A GROUP OF AGENCIES ARE ASKING FOR TRAIN SIMULATOR SPUR THE USE MONTHS ARE AGENCIES. AS WELL AS WHAT. IF I MAY SENATOR THERE'S A COUPLE POINTS THERE TO THAT THE MOST CURRENT TECHNOLOGY NOT SIMULATOR TRAINING THAT WAS POTENTIALLY PRIOR TO THIS LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THERE'S JUST A COLLISION OF SO MANY PEOPLE NEEDING TO GET TO THE EQUIPMENT AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A QUICK MEN OUT THERE. IT'S NOT BILL RIGHT NOW TO HANDLE THE CAPACITY OF WORLD PEACE OFFICERS IN THE STATE. MEMBER BOARD DE ESCALATING. DE ESCALATING CENTER STERN I'M THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WAS WONDERING. AMAZING ON WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH PARKS IN. ISSUE WILDLIFE AND SOME FOLKS IN OUR MOUNTAINS WE HAD. THREE MURDERS IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS NOT TOO LONG AGO SO I'M ACTUALLY WAY TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE- LEVEL OF RISK OUT THERE THAT FACES YOUR RANK AND FILE- SWORN PEACE OFFICERS I WAS JUST HOPING YOU COULD LEND A LITTLE INSIGHT. INTO IF YOU HAVE SOME TOTAL NUMBERS ON USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS INVOLVING SWORN OFFICERS OR EVEN JUST SOME SNAPSHOTS OF THE SORT OF CONFLICT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOING ON OUT THERE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE I EIGHT. THE REASON I ASK IS I THINK IT'S- ONLY A CAREFUL HERE HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE SWORN IN TO DO THIS WORK THAT. THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK IN THE JOB AND THERE'S A SERIES LEVEL JUDGMENT IT'S REQUIRED TO BE EXERCISED IN. THIS IS NOT LIKE A SECOND CLASS KIND OF LAWN FORCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE- I TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN THAT. CASE THE WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE TO DEFEND. THE RIGHT TO FILE SWORN FOLKS OUT THERE WHO. BIG BURDEN TO BUT I JUST CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE HOW MANY INCIDENTS YEAR HAVE YOU DONE THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS OR EVEN JUST A- SNAPSHOT BEYOND MY EXAMPLE OF. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WHICH WAS A VERY SPECIFIC. ACTUALLY IT. YEAH SERIAL KILLER SEPARATISTS AS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION BUT ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS ONE OF THOSE CONFLICTS LIKE. WELL ON BEHALF OF FISH WILDLIFE. OCTOBER LAST DECADE WE HAVE HAD EIGHT OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. SPECIFIC TO OUR AGENCY ARM. THERE'S MOLD AND THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES WHERE WE HAD ACTUALLY A AN OFFICER HAD TO FIRE THE WEAPON IN DEFENSE OF THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE. THERE'S MULTIPLE TIMES RIDLEY CANDID THROUGHOUT THE CALL THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THAT ARE WARDENS WHO WORK OUT IN REMOTE PLACES BY THEMSELVES SINGULAR BY THEMSELVES WITH NO BACK UP. WILLING COUNTER USE OF FORCE SCENARIOS THE PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THEM AND WE HAVE A RANGE OF COURSE AND TRAINING OF HOW TO WORK THROUGH THOSE SCENARIOS AND DE ESCALATE OF COURSE ALL THE WAY UP TO YOU KNOW IN THE END USING YOUR FIREARM AS A LAST RESORT BUT THERE NUMEROUS FOR WILDLIFE OFFICERS AND I SAID THAT NUMBER YOU KNOW JUST AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. FIRST FOR STATE PARKS CENTER WE'VE- WE HAD- IN THE LAST JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR TO OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS WE HAD AN INCIDENT ON PORTIONS AND BIG SERVER AND- ALSO DOWN IN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY AREA- WE DO SOME USE OF FORCE TRACKING INTERNALLY AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW JUST MAYBE MORE ANECDOTAL THAN ANYTHING BUT- A LITTLE OVER. FIFTY INCIDENTS JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WERE- WEAPON HAD TO BE DRAWN TO IN EFFECT. AFFECT AN ARREST- WE TRACK COUNT HOW MANY TIMES WERE. HAVING TO USE A CHEMICAL AGENT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WERE. YOU KNOW DOZENS OF INCIDENTS A YEAR WE HAVE SOME TRACKING ON THAT BUT I MEAN AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE IN A ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS WERE. SOMETHING IS APPLIED. AND CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. AND AT ANY MOMENT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE AN ISSUE THERE WITH. PUBLIC TRUST IN. ON ON. SO WHAT CAN LAST KATE CALPERS BEEN INVOLVED WITH TO OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS WERE OUR OFFICERS WERE ACTUALLY. ENGAGED IN AND- OUT FOR. THE SUSPECT FORTUNATELY THE FIRST INCIDENT THE. RESULT IN THE FATALITY OF TWO. OTHER PEACE OFFICERS ONE A CITY POLICE OFFICER IN ONE NINE POLICE OFFICER. AND THEN THE SECOND WAS JUST RECENTLY MONTH OR TWO AGO. SO THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE CERTAINLY. WHAT WHAT IN RIVERSIDE THAT WAS THE RIVERSIDE INCIDENT IT ALSO INVOLVES STATE PARKS AS A SEPARATE INCIDENTS THAT BURDENS SEPARATE INCIDENT. HE WAS JUST A SENSE OF THE NATURE OF THOSE INCIDENTS I DON'T ASK FOR TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT- THANK YOU WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY. OCCURRED AT LEAST AT A HIGH LEVEL THERE AND STATE PARKS THE FIRST INCIDENT TO THE RESULT IN THE FATALITY OF TWO OFFICERS WAS A WANT SERVICE ON AN ARSON SUSPECT. WORN SERVICE ON AN ARSON SUSPECT BARRICADED HIMSELF UP IN A STRUCTURE AND SO QUE. I MEAN FAR TOWARDS OFFICER. THE LATEST OUR OFFICER ROLLED BACK UP. THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO.

THREE AND YOU SEE PEACE. I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF THEIR FOR AGENCIES. MR TERM HAPPY TO. MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- CHRISTOPHER TRAIL DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR INTEGRATED WATERSHED MANAGEMENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES JOINED HERE BY DIRECTOR BOND OF COURSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE'RE HERE TO REQUEST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR FOUR DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND I'LL JUST START OUT WITH BOTH A CLICHE AND A TRUISM AND THAT IS THAT YOU CANNOT MANAGE WHAT YOU CANNOT MEASURE AND THAT WAS THE WISDOM THAT WAS DRIVING SB NINETEEN BY SENATOR DODD I SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR IN THE REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE STATE'S STREAM GAUGING NETWORK. BUT THEN IF I IN PRIORITIZE GAUGING DATA GAPS AND DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED PLAN TO IMPROVE STREAM GAUGE DATA AVAILABILITY THE STREAM GAGES OR IS ESSENTIALLY JUST SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY PLACE RIGHT NEXT TO OUR STREAM AND RIVER COURSES THAT ALLOW FOR- THE MANAGEMENT. OF WATER RESOURCES NESS FOR SINGLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. FLOOD EMERGENCY RESPONSE WATER SUPPLY OPERATIONS WATER QUALITY WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION ECOSYSTEM MONITORING YOU NAME IT. I WAS REALLY FUNDAMENTAL- INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY FOR. OVER ARCHING WATER MANAGEMENT. AND THIS IS JUST AGAIN FUNDING SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION. PASSED LAST YEAR AND THAT REQUIRES A CONFERENCE OF STUDY OF WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED. RESET YOUR SUPPORT. THE ONE WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT ONE THING THANK. IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET A PRECISE ESTIMATE BUT OUR JUDGMENT IS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR TOTAL WATERSHEDS IN THE STATE. DON'T REALLY HAVE A SYSTEM OF EITHER STATE OR FEDERALLY SPONSORED GAUGING UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE MOVEMENT OF WATER. HOW DO YOU GAUGE THE SAYS. ALEJO GIVE. THIS PROPOSAL I'M SO I'LL I'LL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT OF ALL THREE OF THE B. C. P.'S YOU HAVE IN THIS ITEM BECAUSE OUR OUR COMMENTS ARE THE SAME FOR A B. AND C. READ A MEMBERS WILL BE TAKING EACH OF THE THREE SEPARATELY AS IT AS SET. FORTH IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AB AND C. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH ANY OF THESE REQUESTS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS- FOR WORKLOAD. I THINK OUR OVER ARCHING CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THREE OF THESE PROPOSES IS ALL OF THEM ARE. PROPOSING TO FUN IN EXISTING POSITIONS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW IN OUR FUNDED RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. COMPARED TO SUBSEQUENT YEARS. SAID AND WE DIDN'T SEE A RATIONALE FOR THAT SO AS YOU AS YOU LIKELY ARE FAMILIAR NORMALLY WHEN A DEPARTMENT COMES FORTH TO ESTABLISH NEW POSITIONS. THEY OFTEN ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FIRST YEAR TO SET THAT POSITION UP THEY MAY NEED A COMPUTER THEY MAY NEED A CUBICLE BUTTE BUILD OUT THEY MAY NEED- SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING JUST TO GET UP AND GOING IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THE- AMOUNT IS SLIGHTLY LESS. BUT GIVEN THAT THE THIRTY POSITIONS ACROSS ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ALL EXISTING POSITIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE THEIR COMPUTERS AND CUBICLES AND WE'RE JUST. SWITCHING FUNDING SOURCE ARE MAKING FUNDING ON GOING WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR- PROVIDE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FIRST YEAR IT'S A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ACROSS ALL OF THE THIRTY. DECISIONS DEMONSTRATION HAS SUGGESTED THERE- REDOING THEIR INTERNAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT FOR CHARGING INDIRECT BUT- THAT WASN'T A RATIONALE FOR US FOR WHY THE STATE OUGHT TO BE SPENDING MORE MONEY IN ONE YEAR COMPARED TO OTHERS. THAT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THESE PROPOSALS BUT APPROVING THEM AT THE LEVELS REQUESTED FOR THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS. WITH ADDITIONAL FIVE IN FIFTY IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAYS. THE THIRD DRIVER PART OF FINANCE SO L. THE ALLEY NOTED SO WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH PART OF WATER RESOURCES ON JUST GONNA EVALUATING THEIR OVERHEAD AT THE METHODOLOGY AND SO- THIS IS GONNA MERELY A FACTORS AS MORE TECHNICAL THAN ANYTHING REALLY I JUST KNOW THAT. BUDGET YOUR MAIL IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AUTHORIZED BECAUSE OF OUR EVALUATION OF THAT OVERHEAD METHODOLOGY- BUT YEAH IT'S A MUTE MERELY TECHNICAL. HEY LET'S. OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN ONE TECHNICAL BUDGETING ADJUSTMENTS ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING. I'M SORRY SAID. OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING GO AHEAD YEARS CHECK A THIRD ON THE BEHALF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY CAL TROUT AND TRY TO LIMITED IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL FOR STREAM GAUGING IN PARTICULAR AS INITIATIVE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW GLAD TO SEE IT CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. IS THIS THE IN SITU OR JUST. HEY. CENTRAL VALLEY A FLOOD CONTROL BOARD ANYWAY XIN OF EXISTING STAFFING BUT WHEN THIS ROBERT COR FROM THE GLOBAL GROUP FOR B. AND C. ON BEHALF OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA FLOOD CONTROL AUTHORITY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH THOSE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL THE AGENCIES FOR DECADES. THANK YOU. NOW WE'LL CLOSE. ALL. THIS IS. FIVE WHY ARE. WHEREAS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATORS ARE ASKED AND ANSWERED A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS JUST BE REALLY CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS ANSWERING THE VERY QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING IN A WAY RIGHT THIS IS TO DO THE COMPREHENSIVE STUDY THAT THAT IS REQUIRED OF US BY SB NINETEEN AND SO THEN GETTING TO HOW I BELIEVE IT WILL BE ANSWERING THAT QUESTION WHICH I THINK S ACTUALLY GETS TO YOUR YOUR QUESTION IN TURN IS REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL COORDINATION AS GOOD AS THOSE RELATED TO THE STREAM GAUGING SYSTEM. SO WHAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE EXPECTING IN THIS AND THIS- RESULTING SB NINETEEN REPORT. IS WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE USGS STATIONS THEY TRADITIONALLY HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED ACROSS THE STATE. WHERE THOSE IN RELATION TO THOSE MANAGED BY. FORMER WATER RESOURCES WHERE THOSE RELATION TO THOSE MANAGED BY. DOCTOR BONHAM SHOP AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND LIKE YOU SUGGEST GROUPS LIKE. THE GENIE THAT HAVE THEIR OWN FACILITIES OUT THERE. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO INVEST IN NEW FACILITIES WHERE THERE ARE THOSE DATA GAPS. IT MAKES SENSE TO DO THIS ANALYSIS FIRST AS OF THE SMARTEST INVESTMENTS POSSIBLE. BETTER THIS IS NOT A PROPOSAL. ON THE ACTUAL GAUGES IT'S A PROPOSAL TO DO THE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT. THE NETWORK SHOULD BE. AND THEN COME BACK TO THE CONVERSATION. YES ABSOLUTELY. THE CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE STREAM GAUGING PLAN IMPLEMENTATION THIS IS THE ONE POINT FIVE FOUR ONE MILLION OF WHICH HUNDRED MILLION COMES IN THE WATER RIGHTS FIND OVER TWO YEARS AND ONE POINT ONE FOUR ONE. MILLION COMES GENERAL FUND. MOTION BY CENTER MINING PLEASE CULTURAL. CASKEY HI ONLY REQUIRE. MORNING I. OKAY MATTER OPEN MOTION NUMBER TWO WILL BE THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION POURED CONTINUATION EXISTING STAFFING THIS IS THREE. POINT SIX EIGHT EIGHT MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THREE POINT SIX EIGHT EIGHT MILLION FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. BY CENTER MINING IS CULTURAL ASKING HI ONLY. WHERE RUNNING I CAN KEEP THE ROLE OPEN AND FINALLY A MOTION ON FLOOD OF PLANNING RESOURCING THIS IS APPROVED TWO POINT ZERO EIGHT NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME IN TWO POINT ZERO EIGHT NINE MILLION ON GOING THERE AFTER. I CENTER MONNING PLEASE CALDERON ASKING I ONLY. REQUIRE MONEY I WILL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE TO IT ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN HI DREW METEOROLOGY AND SURFACE WATER OBSERVATIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAME IS CARLA NEMETH AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS OUR BUDGET ITEMS- WITH THIS SUBCOMMITTEE I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS IS A VERY EXCITING TIME TO BE INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA'S WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND IT'S THE DEPARTMENT'S VIEW THAT WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE MANY MANY LOCAL WATER% AGENCIES. FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT'S NEWLY FORMED SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY BUSINESS COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY AND THE MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ENGAGED WITH US AND HOW BEST TO SECURE CALIFORNIA'S WATER FUTURE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN INCREDIBLE IMPERATIVE FOR THE STATE- WE CERTAINLY FEEL IT IN THE AREA OF WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT- AND WITH THAT WE HAVE MORE DETAILS ON- SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT WE THINK CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE RESILIENT WATER SUPPLIES FOR CALIFORNIANS ON THIS FIRST- BUDGET TOPIC- THE PROPOSAL REQUESTS SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. FOR ELEVEN POSITIONS TO SUPPLY HYDRO METEOROLOGY AND SURFACE WATER OBSERVATIONS PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. DO YOU HAVE YOUR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY REMOTE WEATHER STATIONS THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR FLOOD EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING. THE SIX MILLION IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS PROVIDE STAFFING RESOURCES AND EQUIPMENT TO ENHANCE SURFACE WATER MONITORING BY REACTIVATING AN UPGRADING EXISTING MONITORING STATIONS OR INSTALLING NEW STATIONS TO ADDRESS KNOWN INFORMATION GAPS. THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THESE MONITORING SITES ARE INCREASINGLY CRUCIAL TO SMART WATER MANAGEMENT GIVEN THE CLIMATE IMPACTS ON OUR HYDROLOGY AND OUR NEW IMPERATIVE TO BRING GROUND WATER BASINS INTO BALANCE. AS AN EXAMPLE THE USE OF STATIONS ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA IT HELPS THEM TO DETERMINE THEIR IRRIGATION NEEDS MANAGE THEIR SURFACE WATER DIVERSIONS AND THEIR GROUND WATER EXTRACTIONS. AND WITH THAT- I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THESE AGAIN CHRISTIAN OFTEN FORMER WHAT RESOURCES JUST BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THIS ISN'T REALLY A COMPLIMENT TO THE LAST ONE YOU HEARD RELATED TO SB NINE IMPLEMENTATION SB NINETEEN IMPLICATION THAT WAS RELATED TO. WHAT IT IS SURFACE WATER STREAM GAUGE REQUIREMENTS ARE NEEDS RATHER ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY- WEATHER STATIONS- CALLS THE MISTAKE SHINS OR CALIFORNIA YOUR ADDITION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM STATIONS THAT COMPLEMENT THOSE. SERVICE WATER GAUGES- THESE ARE LARGELY PLACED IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS ACROSS THE STATE AND AS A DIRECTOR MENTIONED REALLY HELP FIND THAT GREAT THAT BALANCE THE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR NEEDS BETWEEN. A WHEN IS THE BEST TO FOR SERVICE WATER VERSES GROUNDWATER WHAT IS THE WEATHER LOOKING LIKE IN THIS MOMENT WHAT'S COMING OUR WAY. WHERE IS THE SNOW PACK WHERE'S THE PRECIPITATION THIS REALLY IS A COMPLIMENT IF YOU WELL TO THAT- PREVIOUS ITEM YOU VOTED ON. HOW DOES ONE MAINTAIN OR OUR SERVICE A GAUGE WHAT'S WHAT IT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS. YEAH SO THE- IT WAS A THAT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS SIMPLY GETTING THERE. SO JUST LIKE THE STREAM GAGES AT THE SAME A STATION'S WEATHER STATIONS ARE LOCATED GENERALLY IN PRETTY REMOTE AREAS SOME ARE LESS REMOTE IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON I I'M YOUR GATED AGRICULTURAL. AREAS BUT SOME ARE. VERY MUCH- FAR FLUNG. I'M ACROSS THE ACROSS THE STATE WE REALLY DO NEED IS INFORMATION STATEWIDE AND SO JUST GETTING THERE SO TRANSPORTATION- THAT REQUIRES VEHICLES OF COURSE- BUT BY THINK PREDOMINATELY TO YOUR QUESTION IT REALLY IS THE- THESE ARE. HIGHLY ADVANCED- MONITORING STATIONS SO IT'S WIND SPEED TEMPERATURE OF WATER QUALITY PRECIPITATION SNOW MELT. I'M JUST TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE SNOW FALL YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE MACHINE THAT NOT ONLY AS A AS A PAD IF YOU WILL TO CATCH SO. AND SNOWFALL BUT ALSO HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO- HAVE THAT MELTING AWAY THAT THAN THAT AMOUNT OF SNOW BASED OFF OF BOTH THE WATER CONTENT ANN'S WEIGHT IS MEASURED CALCULATED SO A LOT OF VERY SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS HERE. THAT JUST LIKE OUR AUTOMOBILES REQUIRES CONSTANT VIGILANCE- UPDATING UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GETTING THE MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION POSSIBLE IF IT'S NOT ACCURATE IT'S NOT REALLY USEFUL WHY I GET THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT AND YOU HAVE A- PORTABLE. HI AM GADGET IN YOU AND YOU DO THE MEASUREMENT WERE THAT LEASE THIS PCP BCP TALKS ABOUT TWENTY STREAM CAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE ALREADY YOU WANT TO YOU WANT STAFF AND YOU WANT SOME MONEY TO GO MAINTAIN THEM IS IT A MATTER JUST SIMPLE CALIBRATION TO MAKE SURE ITS OPERATING RIHT OR- IS IT. ARE THESE. IN THE WORLD OF STREAM GAUGES SISTER SOME NEW ELEMENT THAT GOES IN THAT YOU REPLACE LIKE A- YOU KNOW. AN AUTOMOBILE YOU TAKE THIS PART OUT YOU PUT THIS PART IN IN THAT IT PROVIDES DATA. AND YOU KNOW I ASSUME WE WANNA UP OUR GAME BY BY DOING THE SO IT'S BOTH I'M A RECENT EXAMPLE WAS A IN THE SOUTHERN- SO YOU'RE A WATERSHED- ARE SOUTHERN REGIONAL OFFICE- IN OUR FRESNO OFFICE. RECEIVE SOME FEEDBACK FROM OF FOR EXAMPLE THE FRONT WATER DISTRICT THAT SOME OF THE DATA THAT THEY WERE RELYING ON UP IN THE SIERRA WATERSHED WAS NO LONGER COMING THROUGH. SO THAT INVOLVED- THE DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO GO OUT TO THAT STATION AND THERE WAS SOME AVALANCHE ACTIVITY THAT TOOK OUT PART OF THE EQUIPMENT. AND OF THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS TO WORK WITH A LOCAL AGENCY TO REHABILITATE THAT PARTICULAR STATION AND MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS PROVIDING DATA IN. A TIMELY WAY AND THAT'S AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE WHERE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT I'M PARTICULARLY IN PLACES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE'VE GOT SOME CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUND WATER BASINS THAT. NEED TO COME INTO BALANCE OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. THANK YOU. BUT LET'S SUPPOSE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. SEVENTEEN ANY. COMMENTS MORNING AGAIN- RATHER THAN ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY CAL TROUT AND TROUT UNLIMITED- I THINK DEPARTMENT STAFF AND COMMITTEE STAFF SAID IT VERY WELL SO WE ABSOLUTE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT THIS. PROPOSAL AS WELL THANK YOU. OKAY WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING IS OUR MOTION. CENTER I'M AYE SIR DOLLY YEAH. VERY LITTLE IF ANY IS DUPLICATED SO BECAUSE GENERALLY ARE RESOURCES OF ALWAYS BEEN CONSTRAINED TO SOME DEGREE APPROPRIATELY SO- WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO AND WHAT THEY REALLY EVER WANTED TO PLACE THESE WHERE THE INFORMATION IS NOT BEING GATHERED LIKE I MENTIONED ON THE STREAM GAUGE I'M PROPOSAL EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION AND THERE IS A SIMILARLY STRONG COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN STATE FEDERAL LOCAL AGENCIES ON WHERE THESE WEATHER STATIONS ARE PLACED IN SO THERE'S LOTS OF SHARING OF INFORMATION ALL OF THE INFORMATION ACTUALLY THAT WE GET FROM BOTH STREAM GAUGES AND THESE WEATHER STATIONS IS AVAILABLE PUBLICLY- ESSENTIALLY IN REAL TIME AND THAT'S REALLY THE BENEFIT SO IS A LOT OF COORDINATION HERE AS WELL. I TENDER MINING THIS CALL THE ROLL CASKEY HI AILEEN. REQUIRE MORNING TURN TO ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS MOVING THE ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN IT'S NEW- NO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN WE WERE ASKED. SENATE DOLLY REMOVED I ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN SO LET'S GO BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN WHICH IS THE TREND TRANSMISSION OPERATOR COMPLIANCE THIS IS TWENTY THREE NEW PERMANENT POSITIONS. AT S. W. P. SO ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE OUR MISTER TED CRADDICK HE'S THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT- AND HE'S HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THIS ITEM. OKAY MORNING SENATORS GOOD MORNING THANK THANKS FOR BEING HERE SEE YOU GET NEWARK PLOPPED ON YOUR ON YOUR DESK TENER DOLLY IF QUESTIONS. YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT TO THAT SO THE NATION IN THE STATE'S ELECTRIC GRID ARE YOU KNOW EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- FOR YOU KNOW IN OUR OVERALL COUNTRY AND IN STATE IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT RELIABILITY. SO IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS- THERE WAS A MAJOR BLACKOUT ON THE EAST COAST THAT. REALLY STARTED THE INDUSTRY TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT AT PROTECTING THE NATION IN STATES- ELECTRIC GRID IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY AND THEN MORE RECENTLY IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO FROM CYBER ATTACK- SO THERE ARE- AT THREE MAIN ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED WITH REGULATED IN THE NATION AND IN STATE ELECTRIC GRID THAT INCLUDES THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION THAT SETS POLICY. AT THE NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY COUNCIL THAT- ESTABLISHES BASICALLY PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES- TO- FOLLOW AND THEN THE WESTERN ENERGY TO BREAK. AYE LECTER COORDINATING COUNCIL THAT BASICALLY ENSURES THAT UTILITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING THOSE POLICIES TO PROTECT THE ELECTRIC GRID ASSELIN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE RECEIVED A REQUIREMENT FROM THE WESTERN ELECTRICITY- COORDINATING COUNCIL. TO AT IS A TREE OPERATOR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND SPECIFICALLY THAT'S FOR THE- BANKS PUMPING PLANT FACILITIES WHICH AB TRANSMISSION LINES- CONNECTED TO THE STATE'S GRID- THAT THAT WE OWN AND THEN ADDITIONALLY- FOUR DOES TO ME GOES PUMPING PLAN. AS A RESULT OF THAT- WHAT WERE REQUIRED TO DO IS TO REGISTER IS A TRANSMISSION OPERATOR TO ESTABLISH WHAT'S CALLED A OPERATION DESKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN OPERATIONS CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT OPERATES THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AS A WILL BE ADDING A- RAIDERS FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THESE TO TRADE AND FACILITIES FOR THESE FACILITIES AND THEN UNDER THE- MILITARY REQUIREMENTS WE'RE ALSO ALSO REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH WHAT'S CALLED A BACK UP DANCER. IN THE MAIN OPERATING SENT. BACK OPERATING SO- THESE POSITIONS ARE INTENDED TO. ADD THESE TWO SENATORS. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO COMPLIANCE WITH A- DIRECT. AMEND WE CAN CAN OPERATE WATER PROJECT. ALSO WE ARE ESTA OUR INITIAL START UP COST WHICH INCLUDES- YOU KNOW ADDING SYSTEMS- SOFTWARE YOU KNOW JUST TO ROUTE TO RUN THIS AND TO INTERACT WITH A CAL I SO AND THE IN OTHER UTILITIES TO BE ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION OF OUR WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO BE READY TO GO IN THE FALL OF THIS YEAR SO WE'RE AT WORKING ON THAT IN THE END THIS REQUEST IS REALLY FOR THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO NAP OFF THE STILL IS- WE'RE EXPECTING THIS POSITIONS WHERE ANNUAL COST OF ABOUT FOUR MILLION. YEAH. I ALSO HAS A ROLE IN THE OVERALL MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE'S ELECTRIC GRID ANDTHEN UNDER THOUGH THE WAY IT'S SET UP- THE UTILITIES ALSO HAVE OVER A ROLE TO ENSURE THAT THAT WERE AT PROTECTING OUR FACILITIES MANAGING OUR FACILITIES MAINTAINING THE FACILITIES MEN ALSO INTERACT IN THAT ELECTRIC MARKETS- I IN A WAY THAT THE FACILITATES YOU KNOW OVERALL OPERATION SO IT'S A REALLY COMBINED APPROACH BETWEEN CALAIS SO. DIFFERENT UTILITIES IN THE STATE. HE. I AM. OR. YEAH. YES SO I'D SAY THEM ONE ONE PIECE INFORMATION IS THAT CALLAWAY'S SO HAS A ROLE PLUS THE UTILITIES HAVE A ROLE WITH WHICH IS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES IS THE YOU KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT THE RED AND INSURE THAT THAT THE GRID IS SAFE AND NOT VULNERABLE TO CYBER ATTACK IS WHAT REALLY RESPONDING TO STOP RESPONDING TO A REQUIREMENT FROM THE WEST. ELECTRICITY RELY WE CAN'T PULL THAT MANDY IN US TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE FOR ADDITIONAL REINFORCEMENT OF ELECTRIC GRID RIGHT A POINT OF CLARIFICATION A PRIOR TO THIS P. JEANNIE SERVE THIS FUNCTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND WE DON'T LONG STANDING CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY DECLINED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE FURTHER. TO OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO NOW BRING THIS IN HOUSE SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AYE A SO- MOVING FORWARD. FIRE ALL. WE WERE PAYING THIS BILL TO P. JEANNIE AND NOW WE ARE ESSENTIALLY BRINGING THAT SERVICE AND HOUSE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. AT ANY RATE THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. YET I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE- THE YOU KNOW THE I THINK OUR IN A PERFECT WORLD WE'D LIKE P. JEANNIE TO CONTINUE IN THIS ROLE AND SO THAT WAS ONE APPROACH WE LOOKED AT- BUT REGARDLESS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE SYSTEM WE HAVE THIS NEW REQUIREMENT PLACED ON US SO WE'RE- PROCEEDING PROACTIVELY TO BE OVER THE KEEP THE STATE WATER PROJECT FUNCTION IN. FURTHER POINT OF CLARIFICATION IS THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE STATEWATER PROJECT FUNDS OF THIS IS NOT A GENERAL FUND REQUEST THIS IS FUNDED BY TE WATER USERS WHO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. ABSOLUTELY RATE PAYERS PAY FOR THIS THAT VERY VERY TRUE. WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT NO JUST WE ASKED A LOT OF THESE SAME QUESTIONS WHEN WE WERE LOOKING INTO THIS AND THE HEARD A SIMILAR STORY WHICH IS JUST THAT THIS CAT. FROM FEDERAL REGULATORS COMING IN AND LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND- REQUIRING THE SERVICE AND P. JEANNIE DECLINED TO DO IT. TO REALLY PUTTING THE DEPARTMENT IN THE POSITION OF NEEDING TO DO IT I THINK I RECALL THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE DEADLINE WE START GETTING A FEE OF. MILLION DOLLARS A DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FROM BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE SO THE STAKES ARE ARE PRETTY HIGH SO IN OUR- INSTIGATION IT SEEMED LIKE THIS WAS THE OPTION LEFT. TO THE STATE. GOOD THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN LET'S OPEN UP TO PUBLIC HEARING. IT'S THIS TRANSMISSION OPERATOR. TO BE. THE STATE WATER. HI NOBODY ON PUBLIC HEARINGS CLOSE SET. MEMBERS AFRICAN NATIONS TO PROVE HIS BUDGET. THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER MINING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I CASTING HI ONLY. REQUIRE MORNING. LEAVE THAT MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND LET'S JUMP BACK. THE NEW RIVER IN TIJUANA RIVER. OR FORWARD JUMP FORWARD. SPRING FORWARD SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING. THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN. OKAY THIS OF THIS ITEM IS ACTUALLY EMBLEMATIC OF THE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS AMONG STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT AS REQUIRED- AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR WATER SECURITY AND QUALITY CONCERNS IN CALIFORNIA- WITH ME TODAY IS ERIC JARVIS- FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY UP BEFORE YOU. IS A- REQUEST FOR- TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A TEN MILLION OF WHICH- WOULD BE PROPOSED TO COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND. EIGHTEEN MILLION FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT TO DIVERT TREAT AND RE WATER THE NATURAL RIVER COURSE. THE CITY OF CALEXICO HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR THIS FACILITY UPKEEP. THE SECOND PROJECT IS THE TIJUANA RIVER PROJECT- IT'S SIMILAR- IN ITS GOAL IS TO CAPTURE POLLUTION. THROUGH A SERIES OF SEDIMENTATION AND DETENTION BASINS TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF CONTAMINATED WATER TRASH AND SENTIMENT INTO THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY ESTUARY. THE BUDGET REQUESTS THERE IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THE SERIES OF PROJECTS. WE KNOW THAT THE LA HAS IS CONCERNED OVER THE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS FACILITIES- I WOULD INVITE- MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER JARVIS TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE BACKGROUND ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH WATER CONTAMINATION IN THIS PART OF THE STATE. BEFORE YOU START JUST SO EVERYBODY OUR STAFF REPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS EIGHTEEN MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND TEN MILLION FROM- PROP- SIXTY INADVERTENTLY FLIP DOES NOW I. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S. SHAKING IN THEIR IN THEIR LIKE CHAIRS OVER THERE I HEARD THE SAME THING ALRIGHT MR VERSUS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NAME S. FOR THE RECORD JARVIS COUNTY PA GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS. IF YOU MEAN DIRECTOR NAME THIS BRIEF BRIEF OVERVIEW APTLY DESCRIBE OUR TO PROPOSAL SO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. IT IS SOME KEY HIGHLIGHTS PARTICULARLY COLLABORATION. AS YOU KNOW THE NEW RIVER INTO ONE RIVER AS WELL AS THE CANYON'S ADJACENT ARE POLLUTED WATER BODIES SO THIS ALL BEGAN AS WATER QUALITY ISSUES. AND AS YOU LIKELY ALSO NOW WATER QUALITY ISSUES UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS AND SO CALLIE PEES BORDER AFFAIRS PROGRAM HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE. WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES OF TRANS BOUNDARY FLOWS. BECAUSE THE SOLUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR INVOLVE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS THE APPROPRIATE FIT TO MANAGE THIS PROGRAM AND HAS EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA. SO COLLECTIVELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY NDW ARE. WE COLLABORATED TO VOTE TO DEVELOP A SKI SUITE OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AT THE RIVERS. WHEN THE GOVERNOR UNVEILED THE JAN TEN BUDGET HE HIGHLIGHTED MANY AREAS THAT NEED OUR ATTENTION. SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZING THE SCALE AND IMMEDIACY. OF OUR CLIMATE PROBLEM AND THE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY. INCREASE AND LEVERAGE INVESTMENTS ON VARIOUS WATER. ISSUES NOTABLY THE NEW ANTI ONE RIVERS. BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE COMMITTED TO THIS EFFORT AND SO THE GOVERNOR COMMITTED TO TACKLING LONG STANDING TELLING LONG ARE SURE BORDER WITH MEXICO. HE ALSO COMMITTED TO FOSTERING NEW OPPORTUNITIES BUILT BY NATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS MEXICO. IN BAJA CALIFORNIA AND BAJA OR- AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE GOVERNOR SIGNING THE COMMISSION CALIFORNIA'S MEMORY. OF A STANDING. SOMEWHERE YOU FURTHER ENABLES US TO PARTNER WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THE FEDERAL STATE AND WE NEED. TO MAKE THE CALL. TO STREAMLINE OUR BILL TO ADDRESS SHIP ANDREAS AND TO A- OPPORTUNITY. NUMBER EIGHT. WE CHALLENGES NEW ONE RIVERS IN ADDITION TO ERROR CALL MOBILITY TRANSPORTATION AND OVER ON FORCE CHALLENGES ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR THIS- FOR THIS COLLABORATION AND AT THE VERY HEART OF THE PRINCIPLES WITHIN MA'AM ARE YOU. WELL WE'VE HISTORICALLY LOOK TO FEDERAL RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH PUBLIC RICK REDUCTION LONG THE BORDER% ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THE GOVERNOR HAS CHAMPION OUR SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL AND LOCAL CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE IMPROVEMENTS AND WATER QUALITY AND TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. ARE VIABLE COASTLINE PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCES AMONG GOING WASTE DISCHARGES. AT THE RISK OF PREEMPTING NEARLY ALL I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ON GOING ON ONE AND FOR TWO ONE RIVER. AS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA BOTH SETS OF PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND WE'VE INCLUDED TWO YEARS AGO AND AM IN OUR PROPOSAL FOR WASTE CAPTURE THE TIJUANA RIVER. THE CONCERN THE CONSULTANT ONLY OPPOSE REGARDING SECURING ONGOING OWN AND FINDING IS VALID. KELLY PA HAS BEEN SPEARHEADING DISCUSSIONS WITH FEDERAL LOCAL AND STATE ENTITIES FOR THESE PROJECTS. THESE PAST FEW MONTHS CAL HE BE A SPOKEN WITH COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY OF THEM PEARL BEACH MEXICO COUNTERPARTS THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER OF WATER COMMISSIONS WELL AS US EPA AND OTHER FEDERAL ENTITIES. THROUGH THE NATION'S WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT LOCAL COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE AND WELL WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T CAN THE LOCAL STORE AND EVENING WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT FUTURE AND I'M FINDING WILL MATERIAL. I'M NOT OPPOSED THIS IS A GREAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER TO EFFECTIVELY MOVE TOWARD WHICH OFTEN SHOE OF TRANS BOUNDARY FLOWS OF WATER. ASH. ALTHOUGH COMMERCE ARE PULLMAN YOU CAN CLEARLY THERE'S A OF. TO ADDRESS THIS HEALTH QUIRK. QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESS OF NEGOTIATING LONG TERM% COMMITMENTS FROM THE NEW RIVER AND DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY SITUATION WE ARE HOPEFUL ANTICIPATE X. ALREADY COMMANDMENTS OR TO ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. AND I'LL STOP RIGHT THERE MAKE SURE BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OR DON'T HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED DAYS BEFORE WE HAVE TO APPROVE THE JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET AND JUST SEE THAT. THIRTY FIVE MILLION. THE LOCALS IN IN THAT SAN DIEGO AREA. HELLO YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS. SHARE WITH US OUT WE THINK BOTH OF THESE PROPOSED PROJECTS HAVE MERIT THE POLLUTION PROBLEMS AND- IN THE TARGETED AREAS ARE VERY SEVERE- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT. AND MEXICO AS WELL BUT THE- THAT WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE TO HELP AS A PARTNER- AS AS MR DRIVERS NOTED OUR CONCERN IS REALLY AROUND THE TIJUANA RIVER PROJECT IN THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T AN ONGOING- SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR THE NEW RIVER PROJECT THERE IS THEY'VE GOT- A MEMORANDUM WITH LOCAL PARTNERS THAT THEY WILL. COVER THE ONGOING COSTS TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU INCLUDES TWO YEARS OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUT IT SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND SO- WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TWO YEARS WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BEFORE YOU APPROVE THESE FINDINGS CONSTRUCT THESE PROJECTS. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROJECTS TO WORK AND SERVE THEIR PURPOSE SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND. THAT YOU DON'T APPROVE THE FUNDING UNTIL YOU HAVE A PLAN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR HOW THOSE COSTS WILL BE FUNDED NOW MAYBE IT WILL HAVE TO BE THE STATE. FUNDS THOSE GOING COST BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WE THINK BEFORE YOU APPROVE THE PROJECTS AND APPROVED THE FUNDING. RATE WERE OPTIMISTIC WE GET SOME TIPS BUT WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT CERTAINTY BEFORE COMMITTING THE FUNDS. CLARIFICATION FINANCED. BRING TO THIS DISCUSSION- PRIME FULLER PART OF FINANCE- JUST UNDERSCORING THE PREVIOUS REMARKS- UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF GUARANTEEING THE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR THE WATER PROJECT- THE- CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE STILL. IN IN DEVELOPMENT WITH THE LOCAL AND SEIZE THE STATE ENTITIES THE VETERANS THESE. M. THE MINISTRATION. AB IS COMMITTED TO NOT HAVING CONSTRUCTION BEGIN UNTIL THAT ONGOING. FUNDING AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE. WE'D JUST ONE UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE IN THE TIME SENSITIVITY THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS THAT WE WOULDN'T. RECOMMEND DELAYING ANOTHER YEAR. AT AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT. ANGLE THANK. CENTER MCGUIRE A QUESTION THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MISTER CHAIR JUST GOING OFF OF WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING IN THE BEGINNING HERE AT YOU YOU HAD SAID THAT FUNDING SHOULD MATERIALIZE SO I THOUGHT WHAT'S YOUR EXACT WORDS FOR THEIR WOULD WINTER LIES. OKAY FINING SHOULD MATERIALIZE WHATEVER DOWN BUT- SO- GIVES A GLANCE INTO THAT IF YOU DON'T MIND. WELL AS I MENTIONED I WE'VE WE'VE BEEN IN ON ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH- THE LOCALS AND- WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING TO AND AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE CRUNCHY BUT ARE WE TALKING. TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS ARE YOU LOOKING AT TRYING TO BE A TO GET SOMETHING IN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. LOOK I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE I'M MOST FAMILIAR ON THAT THAT THEY HAD A TIJUANA RIVER IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. THE CONDITIONS IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A GLANCE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. JUST SO WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA. YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AS WELL AND YOU WORK. THANK YOU CENTER I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR BORDER AFFAIRS HAS BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING ON ON ON THIS. UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULD BE HERE TODAY.

AND MORE RECENTLY THE UNITED STATES CANADA MEXICO AGREEMENT ALSO- DIRECTS THREE HUNDRED MILLION TWARDS A BORDER WASTE WATER PROJECTS AND THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT FUNDING TOWARDS THESE PROJECTS. IT WILL. I AM. DO WE NOTED THAT THAT THAT IS TYPICALLY THE CASE BUT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED IN AND OUT EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US TO GET THIS RIGHT AND- SORRY NEWS.

THAT THAT WAS WHY THERE WAS TEN MILLION INCLUDED IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FOR THE NEW RIVER AND I'M JUST IN ANOTHER LAYER OF STATE IMPORTANCE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION GOOD ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS THE NEW REFER. HI PROJECT YOU WANNA. RIVER PROJECT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR SURE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS JONATHAN CLAY HERE ON BEHALF OF A COUPLE THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE BEING DANGLED THE DOLLARS IN FRONT OF- COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO AND SUPPORT- A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING WORKED ON THIS FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS MY ENTIRE CAREER HERE- THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO WAS THE LEAD ENTITY IN SUING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- LAST YEAR OVER THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF. A LACK OF CONTINUED FUNDING IN THIS IN THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING ON AT LEAST SINCE THE EIGHTIES A MY MEMORY AND PRE DATING EVEN THEN- I THINK THERE IS SOME OF THE LOT OPPORTUNITY GOING ON AS WAS DISCUSSED THERE'S MOVEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR A RENEWED COMMITMENT OF FUNDING- I THINK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE BEEN DURING THE BRUNT OF THIS FROM YOU PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES IN TERMS OF POLLUTION. TELL A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE STAND READY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT BOTH FROM THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S PROPOSE NOW THE FIFTEEN MILLION THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR FOR ADDITIONAL PROJECTS TWO YEARS BEFORE THAT WITH US IN A WAY SO WITH SB FIVE OF SEVEN WHEN THE COUNTY ACTUALLY CONDUCTED ASSESSMENT OF WHAT PROJECTS NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHICH IS THE PRICE TAG BROWN'S.

A PLAN THAT WOULD CONSIDER ALL THE IMPAIRMENTS CONSIDERING MEXICO ALL THE WAY TO THE SALTON SEA- THE MATTER THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU HERE AND FOR WHICH A SECURE SUPPORT. IS THAT THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED. WITH THE RESOURCES FOR THE NEW RIVER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT ARE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED IN ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER RELATIONS COUNCIL IN TWENTY TWELVE. I DO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE RIVER ISSUE AS YOU FOLKS ARE AWARE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC THREAT ISSUE FOR THE RESIDENTS OF IMPERIAL COUNTY FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS.

GOOD MORNING OR AFTERNOON PUBLIC GUYS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND- STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE MONEY THE FUNDING FOR THE NEW RIVER PROJECT TO ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WATER QUALITY IMPACTS IN CALEXICO AND THAT THE SALTON SEA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MORE TALKS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT ON THE ITEM RELATED TO THE TIJUANA RIVER- AS MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE COUNTY INDICATED WE HAVE BEEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF- OF THE POLLUTION. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND DECADES I'M SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORTH- TO OUR TO COALESCE NOT JUST US BUT THE FEDS AS WELL. MNC SOME UNIQUE- ARRANGEMENTS. CURRENTLY AND WE LOOK FORWARD% TO CONTINUING THAT DIALOGUE THROUGH THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THANKS. ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S STRONG SUPPORT OF THE. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING I'D LIKE TO. DO THIS IN TWO PARTS IS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION- HAS SAID SO THE FIRST MOTION WOULD BE TO APPROVE THE- AB. B. C. P. FOR THE NEW RIVER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. THERE'S A MOTION IS THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER MCGUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MY CASKEY HI ALI. WHEN MONEY. HOLD THAT MATTER OPEN WE WILL HOLD. THAT FACT YOU WANNA MATTER. GOOD LUCK. NEGOTIATE BUT ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THIS IS THE SIGMA THIS IS SYMBOL GROUND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM- THE GOVERNOR HAS A- THIRTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL THIRTY SOME POSITIONS GO AHEAD. WITH ME IS A MISTER KEITH WALLACE OF FROM OUR SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT OFFICE. I'M THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REQUESTS NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR STAFFING AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR GRANTS TO THE NINETEEN CRITICALLY OVERDRAFT GROUND WATER BASINS THAT ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT THEIR LOCAL BROWN WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS TO SUPPORT PLANNING AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED TO ADDRESS A BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO EACH OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE LEADING THE BASINS OVERALL EFFORTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF IDENTIFYING A ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS AND EXPLORING WAYS TO ADDRESS THEM. THOSE LOCAL GROUND WATER AGENCIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COORDINATE WITH THE OVERLYING COUNTY TO ENSURE THESE EFFORTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH COUNTY PLANNING AND PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE AWARE OF THE ALIENS% RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION REGARDING THE FUNDING A PROPOSED FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN THIS ITEM AND WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO WORK WITH THE SUB SUB COMMITTEE IN THE LA- AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE LANGUAGE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE STAFF COMMENTS THAT REFERENCE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF LOCAL GROUNDWATER PLANS IN ADDRESSING IMPACTS TO DRINKING WATER WELLS. THE DEPARTMENT SHARES IN THE CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACTS TO DRINKING WATER WELLS. LOWERING OF GROUND WATER LEVELS AFFECTS ALL ELEMENTS OF SICKNESS PRIORITIES A DEGRADED WATER QUALITY SUBSIDENCE SEA WATER INTRUSION AND DEPLETION OF INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATERS. E. W. R. IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. FOR THEIR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THESE IMPACTS AND THE PLANSMUST IDENTIFY IMPACTS OF CONTINUED GROUNDWATER DEPLETION ON EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS AND THEY MUST IDENTIFY HOW THESE IMPACTS ON ALL BENEFICIAL USES ARE CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PLANS. OUTSIDE THE SPECIFIC REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF SIGMA THE STATE HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT INTERFACE WITH GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL WATER SYSTEM. IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA REQUIRES CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SB TWO HUNDRED SAFE DRINKING WATER AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SENATORS GREAT EFFORTS. THOSE DOLLARS. TO DO TO SOLVE THE DRINKING WATER PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT T BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT IN ADMINISTERING A SIGMA THE DEPARTMENT'S VIEW IS THAT SB TWO HUNDRED FUNDING IS NOT A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS FURTHER WATER QUALITY DEGRADATION. THAT MAY BE DISCLOSED IN THESE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS- WE EXPECT THAT THOSE PLANS WILL NEED TO ARTICULATE SEPARATELY HOW THEY ARE DRESSING DOMESTIC WELL IMPACTS- THAT COULD ARISE AS THE AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS. E. W. R. IS JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF ITS PLAN REVIEW WE RECEIVED FORTY FIVE PLANS- BY THE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE- AND WE ANTICIPATE MANY PUBLIC COMMENTS BEFORE THE APRIL FIFTEENTH AND MAY FOURTH DEADLINES- ON THOSE PLANS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING- INTENSIVELY WITH MEMBERS FROM THE- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THEY'VE BROUGHT- VERY GOOD IDEAS TO THE TABLE INCLUDING. A MITIGATION PLAN IF YOU WILL FOR DOMESTIC- WELL MITIGATION- THAT KIND OF OVER ALL. A POLICY IDEAS AND APPROACHES VALLEY VERY HELPFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS WE START THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING- THOSE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS. SO WITH THAT- I'D BE DELIGHTED TO ANY QUESTIONS. LET'S HEAR FROM YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR US SO AS STRICTER NEMETH NOTED YOU HAVE TO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU ONE IS NINE POINT SIX MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR. SUPPORT OF DEPARTMENT TO PLAY THEIR ROLE I AND THEN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE SO ON THE FIRST PIECE WE WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING WE THINK OF SIGMA'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY LARGE PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND IS AT A CRITICAL POINT OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND THE DEPARTMENT. PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. ON THE AS AS A DIRECTOR NOTED ON THE ONE TIME LOCAL ASSISTANCE WE THINK THERE IS A NEED IN A ROLE FOR THE STATE TO HELP SUPPORT THESE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS THAT ARE IN THE ON THE FRONT LINES THAT REALLY STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THEIR PLANS. BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THAT FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE THAT IT'S FOCUSED ON PUBLIC BENEFIT NOT PRIVATE BENEFIT. AND ALSO THAT IT IS REALLY HELPING TO- IMPLEMENT. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AFFECT OF LEAVE IT I'M THAT THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND THAT THE STATE DOLLARS SHOULD BE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON. THE STATE ROLE IN HELPING CALLS IMPLEMENT THIS ACT THERE ARE GONNA BE LOTS OF OTHER IMPACTS FROM SIGMA THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY SO WE THINK PUTTING SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THAT FUNDING IS IMPORTANT. CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WASN'T HERE EARLIER I DO WANT TO WELCOME VICE CHAIR DOLLY TO THE COMMITTEE WELCOME ABOARD NICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US AND ALSO WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR YOUR WORK IN. ON LA FOR YOUR AY. SO MY QUESTIONS DO GO DO YOU TOUCHED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. THERE IS A REQUIREMENT OF OUTREACH TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION OF THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT HOW THAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN WHAT'S THE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE. IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER SO THE DEPARTMENT- ISSUED- BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AROUND OUT REACH TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE ALSO. PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO ASSIST IN THOSE- GSA'S OF DOING OUTREACH TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- AS THE PLANS COME IN AND OF COURSE RIGHT NOW. IN IN MULTIPLE PHASES SO- THE PLANS THEMSELVES- WERE HAVE RELEASED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- IN OCTOBER AND THEY HAD MOSTLY IN A NINETY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD WHERE STAKEHOLDERS COULD PROVIDE COMMENTS TO THE ACTUAL GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY- THOSE PLANS ARE THEN ADOPTED. THEY WERE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS OPENED ITS OWN PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD- ON THOSE PLANS SO WE ANTICIPATE- OUT OF THAT PUBLIC COMMENT TO GET- SOME SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK- THAT I THINK THERE'S OF A- SAFE TO SAY THERE'S SOME REAL VERY ABILITY. AND HOW THE DIFFERENT GROUND WATER. TESTING ABILITY AGENCIES WHEN ABOUT REACHING OUT TO- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE AND WE WILL BE ASSESSING EACH PLAN INDIVIDUALLY AS TO THE- WHETHER OR NOT A OUTRAGE DONE APPROACH. AND PUT WAS PROVIDE AN INPUT WAS RESPONDED TO I'M SO THAT IS ALL TO THAT IS ALL TO COME- IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ITS OWN GUIDANCE OUT AS THOSE PLANS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT. WE WILL USE TO. HELP MEASURE THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLAN OVERALL. I APPRECIATE THEM. YOU DID MENTION IN YOUR- OPENING COMMENTS. PROTECTION OF SB TWO HUNDRED FUNDING FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. BUT AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMUNITY OUT REACH THAT'S THAT'S REQUIRED IT'S EXPECTED THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THEM. NECESSARILY INVOLVES AN INFORMED PUBLIC THAT HAS% CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT SWEAR I DO APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT THE ENVIRO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY IN ADVOCATES BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY POSITIONED IN EVERYONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES EITHER SO I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL GAP BETWEEN. EVEN WELL INFORMED ADVOCATES ABILITY TO LIAISON WITH SOME OF THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THOSE THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY COME ON THE RADIO ARE OR ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGE SO. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES YOU'LL USE TO VERIFY I GUESS OUR CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF THE PLANS WILL CHECK A BOX THING WE DID COMMUNITY OUT REACH. BUT HOW DO YOU GO BELOW THAT CHECKING THE BOX TO VERIFY. A REAL ENGAGEMENT WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO THE END OF MAKING SURE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AS PART OF THE SUSTAINABILITY. YES A ONE WAY WE CAN ADDRESS IT IS THROUGH- SO WE WON'T THE DEPARTMENT WILL MAKE AN EVALUATION AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO COMPLETE THAT EVALUATION WITHIN TWO YEARS OF RECEIVING. THE PLANS I'M IN IN THAT CONTEXT THE DEPARTMENT CAN- FIND AN INADEQUACY DETERMINATION AND THAT'S WHEN WE ENGAGE WITH THE BOARD- BUT IN FINDING ADEQUACY WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. AND SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES WHERE- THE TIMING OF THEIR PUBLIC MEETINGS- BEING IN THE AFTERNOON OR THEY'RE LACKING IN TRANSLATION SERVICES OR THEY MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT- THE FEASIBILITY OF A WELL MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE ALL DOING IT IN A- A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY- IRRESPECTIVE OF THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BUT- THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY ON. IN PLANTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL TO ISSUE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT- SENSUALLY- IN ABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON THE QUALITY OF THE INPUT AND THE QUALITY OF THE DATA. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR APPROACH FOR A VALUE. WAITING THE ABILITY OF IMPORT COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND CONTINUE TO PRIDE TECHNICAL INFORMATION AS THE PLAN ITSELF IS IMPLEMENTED. PART OF THE DYNAMIC OF SIGMA AS YOU KNOW IS WE HAVE IN PERFECT INFORMATION SO WHAT'S ENOUGH INFORMATION WITH THE RIGHT STRUCTURE WITH THE ABILITY TO INVOLVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY- TO. DEVELOP A PLAN THAT'S ADEQUATE BUT THAT BY DEFINITION IS GOING TO IMPROVE OVER TIME AND WE HAVE THOSE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AVAILABLE TO US TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A HIGH QUALITY. PARTICIPATION I'M NOT JUST IN THE PLAN AS IT WAS DEVELOPED BUT AS THE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME THANK UNITS SOUNDS LIKE. YOU RESPOND- MIKE QUESTION KIND OF THE EVALUATION OF SUBMITTED PLANS AND HAVE THAT DONE IS THERE ANY FRONT END DIRECTION GIVEN TO WHAT IS EXPECTED IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU COULD SHARE WITH US THAT SHOWS HOW THOSE DEVELOPING THE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN SO WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS OF THE DEPARTMENT. OR PROTOCOLS BEST PRACTICES ALASKA MY COLLEAGUE KEITH WALLACE THINK ON IT THE VERY MUCH I AM YES IN IN COLLEGE EARLIER THAT DO HAVE GUIDANCE THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPROPRIATE WAY OF GOING ABOUT ATTACKING PROBE PUBLIC REACH WHILE IT IS. I SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW IS THEBEST APPROACH BASED ON. BEST PRACTICES. YOU THE LOCAL ARE FOR TO GO ABOUT IT AND THEY'VE SEE BY FIT. WE ARE THE PROCESS OF I DO NUMBER OF WORK SIGNAL FORMS TO EXIT OVER THE- SEVERAL WERE BRING THE GROUND SUITABILITY AGENCIES TO. BOTH OF THOSE PRETTY CLEAR BY AND GS THAT HAVE ALREADY SOME THEIR PLAN AND HIGH MEDIUM BASE. THAT ARE SO IN PROCESS TO DEVELOP THEIR PLAN. AND WE SEE THAT A VENN FOR SHE FOR. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DEFINITELY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND WE HAVE ON OUR AGENDA FOR THIS YEAR IS OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT. WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE NGO COMMUNITY- TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT THEY FELT WERE HANDLED VERY WELL. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IDENTIFY THOSE GSA'S AND ALLOW THEM TO SHARE THE PRACTICES THEY'VE CONDUCTED- WITH THE OTHER GSA'S TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE- THE THOSE THOSE BENEFICIAL APPROACHES CAN BE YOU KNOW CARRIED ON OVER- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU SO I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US IF YOU HAVE ANY MATERIALS THAT ARE BEING SHARED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE THAT KIND OF SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND EXPECTATIONS. THAT'S KIND OF AT THE FRONT END AND THEN AS YOU EVALUATE SUBMITTED PLANS. AND WHAT YOUR CHECKLIST WILL BE TO VERIFY THAT AGAIN THEY'RE NOT JUST CHECKING A BOX THAT WE DID COMMUNITY OUTREACH. SO APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THEN. LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU BYE SAID. HER. DOLLY HI THIS MY CONCEDED WORKS WILL. SO HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY DO YOU VIRUS TO COME UP DISADVANTAGED. WHAT WHAT YOU'RE HOW DO YOU WITH THIS IS BEEN A OF. A LOT OF FRUSTRATE FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE AIR FOR MOST OF THE YEAR AND THEN. WE GET BUMPED OUT ON ALL KINDS OF GRANT OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF THAT AND THEN ALSO- PEOPLE OF COLOR SO THEY'RE THE THEY'RE VIRUS GREEN REALLY ISN'T THAT WHERE WE TRY TO ADDRESS THIS OVER TIME. AND WE'VE NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH IT SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA IS BECAUSE I KNOW- IN MY SENATE DISTRICT IF THERE ARE. BASINS THAT ARE. GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THEY ARE. OUR HAPPEN TO COME UP THE RESOURCES. THEMSELVES TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT'S DIFFICULT FROM FROM TO DELIVER GRANT PROGRAM PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT WILL USE ENVIRO SCREEN. I WOULD BUT I WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY THE APARTMENT GRANT PROGRAMS UTILIZE THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY A DEFINITION DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT INFORMATION IS GATHERED BY BY THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY AND THEN. YOU WE UTILIZE THAT INFORMATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY TOOL THAT WE PUBLISHED THROUGH OUR WEBSITE THE THAT HIGHLIGHTS WHAT AREAS ARE CONSIDERED DISADVANTAGED. BOTH AND ALSO SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS BUT THIS. THESE FUNDS ARE. GOING TO BE FOR POSITIONS AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE A GRANT PRO THAT WILL HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES CRACKED. THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION THE THREE SOME POSITIONS ARE GENERAL FUND. IN AND ALSO THE THIRTY MILLION IS ALSO GENERAL FUND AS WELL AND- RIGHT NOW- IT IS TO EAT YES IT IS NOT TIED TO ANY BOND FUNDING. TO CLARIFY SENATOR NAME WHAT SIX IS FOR DEPART THE THIRTY MILLION IS LOW ASSIST SO GO TO GROUND SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES BUT THERE PROPOSAL IS NOT TO SELECT CERTAIN BASED ON INCOME OR DISADVANTAGED STATUS IT WOULD BE TO EACH OF THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS THAT ARE. KIND OF ON THE FRONT LINES HAVING TO SUBMIT THEIR PLANS FIRST THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY. DISADVANTAGED TEST IF YOU WILL FOR WHO WOULD GET THAT FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW. OKAY SO I'M TRYING TO GET A IDEA WHAT THEIR ROLE WOULD BE. BUT WITH THESE POSITIONS THERE'S THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS OR WHAT WITH THE ROLE BE. THE THERE WOULD BE TWO PURPOSES ONE IS TO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ROLES UNDER CIGNA ONE IS TO PROVIDE FORMER REGULATORY ROLE. THAT'S TO- REVIEW- THESE GRAMMAR CIVILITY PLANS ARE PRESENTED TO US. THE SECOND IS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND NATURAL SYSTEMS PROVIDED. THROUGH IT'S IN PLAIN ENGAGEMENT WE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF THROUGHOUT EACH OF OUR REGIONAL OFFICES. THAT ARE SIGNED EACH OF OUR TIME BEING PARTY BASINS- IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- THEY ARE A CONDUIT BETWEEN. THE LOCAL GRAMMAR AGENCIES AND THOSE REFORM IS AN OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THERE ARE TUNNELS SYSTEMS PROJECTS. WE ARE GATHERING DATA LIKE LAND YOU STATE- COLLECT HYDROLOGIC DATA- OF THE FIELD IDENTIFY SUBSIDE INCIDENT THAT WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE THERE ARE. THERE WE VIEW THERE THERE THERE TO BE AN ECONOMY OF SCALE FOR THE STATE TO BE GATHERING THIS INFORMATION PEOPLE TO. BE PRESENT AT PRESENTED TO- THE STATE ONLINE. THAT THEY CAN YOU. RATHER THAN HAVE. THIS INFORMATION GATHERED A PIECEMEAL APPROACH. WE HAVE A TACKLE SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY MAKE- DRILLING CONTRACTORS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AGENCIES. SO THEY CAN DRILL DEDICATED MONITORING WELLS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HAVE. SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM. THAT WE- MAKE WE HAVE FACILITIES WILL MAKE AVAILABLE. THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK OUT VERY CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT MAY EXIST. IN THE AND SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT THESE TO WILL ABLE TO DO IS ENABLE TO. CONTINUE PROVIDE THAT SAME LEVEL OF TO SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN. OF ASAL YEARS WELL STILL BEING ABLE TO REVIEW THE GROUND SENATE BILL PLANS WE HAVE TO. AS A AS A AS REQUIRE. TO REVIEW AND SO IF WE WERE TO. TAKE EXISTING HE'S WE HAVE NOW WE WOULD NEED TO APPLY TO OUR REGULAR REVIEW. AND THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING WITH BLACK. IS THIS REALLY A- OUR OVERALL. PLANS AS THEY. YEAH BUT WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE BEATING. WE THOSE WILL OUT HERE. OUR LAUGHING NEEDED BOTH. NEW THE REVIEW AND YOU TOO BYE ASSIST MEDIUM. IT YOU. YEAH MORE. WHEN THE DEADLINE ALL TOLD ME HOW MANY BUT. I LIVE IN A IN A BASEMENT WITH SO WE HAVE A- WELLS AND SEPTIC I'M ON A WELL- BUT WE ARE THE VALLEY THAT I LIVE I IS ACTUALLY THEY THEY THIS. AT THE CEMETERY IN A LONG COUNTY ROADS A. B. THEY CAME IN AND DRILLED ELLS WE HAVE. HUNDREDS WELLS ALREADY THERE THAT JUST. AND WE'VE BEEN MONITORING FOR SOMETIME BAGWELL'S. YOU I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT. IT'S A BIRD IS GONNA BE A BURDEN ON THOSE OF A THE LANDOWNERS THERE TO. COME UP WITH THE COST TO FIGURE OUT FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY HARD TO COLLECT THIS DATA BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. HOW FASTER RECHARGES AND THERE'S AND IT DEPENDS ON PRECIPITATION AND I MEAN THERE ARE. A LOT OF FACTORS IN THERE. SO THAT WAS MY CONCERN I KNOW LAST YEAR WE DID YOU KNOW I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER THE BILL THAT WE TOOK G. GIRAFFE FUNDS TO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SOMETHING IN IN USED IT IN THE STATE FOR WHICH I. VOTED AGAINST I THINK THERE'S A NEXUS BETWEEN. GLOBAL WARMING IN GROUNDWATER I'M I OR MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME BUT- WHATEVER. NO BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION HOW THE INFORMATION IS DISTRIBUTED AND HOW AND WHO GETS TO DO WHAT AND WHO'S GONNA. WHO'S GONNA UPSET SOME AS WELL OFF AT SOME POINT. I THINK THAT THAT WE'RE HEADING DOWN A PATH OF. LIKE KIND OF SCARY I THINK FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THERE RIGHT ON THAT EDGE. WILL BE IN IN SOME COMMUNITIES DID A BETTER JOB OF LIKE. REPORTING OR FINDING INFORMATION OUT AND IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHERS WERE BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST ADVANCE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. THEY ACTUALLY DISSED WERE PUT IN BY THE STATE AND THEN TRY TO HAVE TO DIFF IT SO THESE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE. ASSISTING THEM OR THEY CAN BE REGULATING THEM LIKE I THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE POSITIONS IS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE A WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND INTO YOUR POINT- IN A WEEK WE ARE COLLECTING DATA AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AGENCIES LIKE YOURS- SO THAT THEY HAVE AND WE ALSO HAVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL THAT WE HAVEN'T- AWARDED IT ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OR WILL BE AWARDING A THIRD ROUND OF WORK ON OUR PURSES IMMIGRANT WATER MANAGEMENT PLANNING GRANT FUNDS HERE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS- TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST. THOSE LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE ONE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT THAT REALLY ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO BE ABLE MAKE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP THESE REFERENCES INABILITY PLANTS AND SO THAT'S THAT IS ONE AVENUE BUT REALLY WHAT WILL BE OUR WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING IS THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE DO HAVE A REGULATORY ROLE BUT WE WANT TO USE THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN NOT ONLY THAT REGULATORY FUNCTION WE HAVE TO REVIEW THE BROWN VERSUS INABILITY PLANS. BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THANK YOU TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE BAKER WITH THEIR GRIEVANCES SEATS FOR THE TWO. ENGINEERS CAL. GOVERNMENT HERE TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. WE REPRESENT THE ENGINEERS IT'LL ACTUALLY BE DOING THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. OTHERS A FEW ISSUES AT STAKE IN THIS PROPOSAL- WE SUPPORT THE POSITIONS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME'S DAVE YOURS WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER I WANT TO START BY THANKING TRACTOR NAY WITHIN HER STAFF. FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE SO FAR ON SEGMENTATION WORKING WITH US ESPECIALLY ALL THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ON ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND. ON THE GROUND WE'RE SEEING. NUMEROUS GSA'S REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE IMPACTS THE DRINKING WATER. BOTH QUANTITY AND THE QUALITY SIDE. AND IF THAT'S NOT CORRECT BY THE DEPARTMENT OR STATE WATER BOARD IN THE GSP REVIEW WE'RE GOING TO SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER ACCESS. OUR THAT IS CAUSED BY THE LACK OF OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING THAT CENTER MONNING BROUGHT UP. BUT IF YOU ARE OUT REACHING ENGAGING THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR NEEDS YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE PLANS. THAT FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THE IN SERIOUS IMPACTS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES I ALSO ONE STATE THAT. ANALYSIS OF SEVEN GS PIECE DONE BY CLEAN MORE ADVOCATES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND. RESIDENTS WILL BE IMPACTED BY DEWATERING OF WELLS POTENTIALLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S JUST SEVEN GS. GSA'S AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING WATER QUALITY IMPACTS OUTSIDE INCLUDING THOSE WERE GONNA IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF CONTAMINANTS. THIS IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE GSP REVIEW PROCESS THE BURDENS CAN BE BORNE BY THE STATE THROUGH THE STATE FOR THE DRINKING WATER FUND. THE FUN WASN'T DESIGNED TO ADDRESS POOR SIGNAL IMPLEMENTATION AND SO THERE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE FUND IS THREATENED. THE REASON IS COMMITTED TO BEING HELPFUL THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND WE WILL BE SUBMITTING. SEVERAL G. S. P. THE- LETTERS DETAILING THE IMPACTS TO QUANTITY AND QUALITY. BUT WE HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY AND WE CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE SO THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT GOES ON IN THIS YEAR'S PEAS WERE. THE A B. C. OR OUR ALLIES ARE NOT WORKING. SO IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT. DURING THE REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE WATER BOARD THE QUESTION NEEDS TO BE ASKED HOW IS THIS PLAN IMPACTING SAFE DRINKING WATER. IF THAT QUESTION IS AN ASKED AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT MANDATED WE'RE THREATENING. THE HOW FAR WE'VE COME TO CREATING A SAFE DRINKING WATER FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. BUT AFTERNOON TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MICHAEL CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'D START BY SIMILARLY THINKING- THE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS THE W. OUR STAFF FOR SOME REALLY GOOD MEETINGS WE'VE HAD- AS WELL AS THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE W. OURS TAKING DRINKING WATER IMPACTS- RELATED TO CIGNA SERIOUSLY. RIGHT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT SIGMUND PULLMAN TATIAN AND THEY STEM FROM A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST- WE WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THAT. WERE THE FIRST TO SEE DR WELLS IN THE LAST DROUGHT THEY WERE THE FIRST TO SEE DRY AFTER AYE WELLS OR THEY WILL BE THE FIRST TO SEE DR WELLS IN THE NEXT DROUGHT. AND THEY'VE CONTINUED TO SEE WELL AS GOOD DRIVE EVEN AFTER THE DROUGHT ENDED SO THEY DESERVE THESE ARE CONTINUING IMPACTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS THAT WE'VE ENGAGED ON AND SEEN SO FAR THOSE ARE ABOUT THIRTEEN PLANS I BELIEVE- ARE REALLY AN ADEQUATE THERE'S ONE PLAN IN PARTICULAR THAT WOULD ALLOW ABOUT 86% A WELLS TO GO DRIVE DOMESTIC WELLS- AND WE DON'T WE BROUGHT THAT INFORMATION TO THE GSP THEY CAME BACK AND SAID WELL NO THAT'S- THAT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S ONLY ABOUT 50% WELLS. AND THAT'S THAT'S A COMPLETELY INADEQUATE RESPONSE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF YES PLEASE. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY- WE SUPPORT FUNDING FOR D. W. ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THEIR ABLE TO REVIEW PLANS ADEQUATELY- TO ADD. REVIEW TO ANALYZE WHAT THE DRINKING WATER IMPACTS WILL BE RELATED TO THE ESPYS ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT. DON'T HAVE NGOS DOING ANALYSIS- IN ADDITION AND THEY OUTRAGE ENGAGEMENT ISSUE PROPOSITION ONE PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY UNDER OUR UNDERSTANDING IS PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT DOES NOT PROVIDE CONTINUED FUNDING AND THAT'S NOT AN ELIGIBLE EXPENSE INTERPRET SIXTY EIGHT. SO THAT'S A GAP THAT NEEDS TO BE FILLED. AND THEN AS WE IMPLEMENT THE PROJECTS NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED NEAR- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE DIRECT BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TUNING TO WORK WITH YOU HAVE YOU ARE AND COMMITTEE THANK YOU. Q. NEXT AFTERNOON JENNIFER CLARY CLEAN WATER ACTION THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMMENTS TODAY THEY WERE ALL SUPER HELPFUL A MY ORGANIZATION IS TEAMED WITH SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS AND THE WATER FOUNDATION TO REVIEW AS MANY PLANTS AS WE COULD WE REALLY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW AND WE'RE ABLE TO WORK YOU THIRTY ONE OF THE FORTY FIVE PLANS WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW WHAT THE RESOURCE NEEDS ARE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS NOT. FAIR NOT TO THE TOP OF THE LIST ABOUT EIGHT OTHER PLANS DON'T EVEN HAVE A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PLAN- THE ONES THAT DO DON'T ACTUALLY GO TO THAT THEY MIGHT IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE BUT THEY DON'T LIKE LOCATE NECESSARILY LOCATE MONITORING WELLS NEAR THOSE COMMUNITIES SECTION MEASURE IF THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR WATER THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS ON THOSE WATER SUPPLY AND SO I A SUGGESTED THEY DON'T MEET THE- REQUIREMENT TO CONSIDER THE INTERESTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT GOES BACK TO THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE THE STRUCTURE OF THE GROUNDWATER THE STORE IS THAT ARE IN POWER NOW AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INCENTIVE TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN POWER AND WE'RE SEEING THAT ON THE GROUND IN WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE PLANTS AND HOW THEIR RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR WATER SUPPLY MOST OF THE PLANS DON'T HAVE CONCRETE- PLANS FOR HOW THEY'RE EITHER GOING TO HANDLE DEMAND MANAGEMENT OR NEW SUPPLY. OVER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN. AND SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS A STEEP DECLINE. IN WATER LIKE A CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN WATER LEVELS FOR THIS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE UNTIL SOMEONE COMES IN AND SAY HEY YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. AND SO WE HOPE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. AND WE THINK THAT- YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT. WHAT ARE WE DONE WITHOUT AMONG CALIFORNIA- I WENT ONLINE MYSELF- AND MY REALIZATIONS WITH THE COMMENTS. THOSE MADE BY A- THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN ADDITION WE WERE- IN ADDITION TO THAT- TO A JENNIFER CLEAR IT WAS JUST SAYING- WE TO WERE PART OF THAT REVIEW TEAM IN LOOKING AT THESE THIRTY ONE- PLANS. WHEN I THINGS THAT- HAS CONSTANTLY COME UP OVER AND OVER IS THAT THERE IS NO OR A REAL CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACTS TO THE- HE- ASSUMES. OF. SOME OF THESE PLANS. ARE SPECIFIC. BY WAY. AND BOB.

A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES JUST WANT TO STAY THAT AQUA HAS COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN THE W. OURS ABILITY TO. EVALUATE AND RESPOND TO THE GSP SORT OF ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE G. AT THE ESPYS WILL HAVE INADEQUACIES BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT THE DEADLINE. FOR THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS TO SUBMIT THEIR PLAN WAS ONLY A MONTH GO. SO D. W. R. IS IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF EVALUATING THESE GS PEAS AND- WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT THEY'RE GIVEN THE TIME AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THEIR JOB SO THANK YOU. STATE ELEVEN SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION. OF WE WOULD LIKE TO- ALSO STATE OUR- SERIOUS CONCERN WITH THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON A DRINKING WATER WELLS AND THE FACT THAT WATER QUALITY WATER QUALITY ISSUES NEED TO BE VERY MUCH FRONT AND CENTER IN THE EVALUATION OF- THESE GS PIECES THEY GO FORWARD ALL. WE'VE HEARD THINGS THAT AREN'T IN THE GS PEAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IN A LOT OF THE T. S. P.'S IS A RELIANCE ON GROUNDWATER RECHARGE- BASICALLY SUPPLY AUGMENTATION AS OPPOSED TO DEMAND MANAGEMENT IN TERMS OF HOW TO- HOW TO- COME INTO PLANTS ALL MY RESERVATIONS BEEN IN THE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND- ONE FIRST THING WE WOULD SAY AT AND WE WOULD DO OF POINT OUT TO DEPARTMENT THAT WE KNOW THEY KNOW THIS VERY WELL AS THE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE IS NOT A PANACEA. AND THERE CAN BE SERIOUS IMPACTS THE GROUNDWATER QUALITY- DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU PUT THE WATER WHAT'S IN THE SOIL ALREADY- SO. THIS RELIANCE ON- ON ON RECHARGE- ON THE PART OF THESE GS PIECES SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SCRUTINIZED VERY CLOSELY. AND THAT THAT. BOTH TECHNICAL OF IF YOU'RE SCRUTINIZED WHETHER OR NOT IT IT IT'S A GOOD IDEA. IF SO WHAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE GSA'S TO IMPLEMENTED AND VERY SPECIFICALLY WATER THE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS THERE CAN BE BENEFICIAL IMPACTS- DILUTION BUT THERE CAN ALSO BE SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON GROUND WATER QUALITY AND SO ALL THESE THINGS NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AS PART OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT THIS IS THE SYSTEM WIDE. BUTTON PROVEN PROJECTS NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS GO AHEAD. OKAY ISSUE TWENTY- I WANT TO START BY NOTING THE IMPORTANT COOPERATIVE NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL- AND THE NEXT. FLOOD MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AMONG STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL AGENCIES. THE DEPARTMENT HAS GENERAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND A MORE SPECIFIC ROLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHILE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS OUR STATE EXPOSURE TO FLOOD RISK REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ECONOMY. THESE PROPOSALS SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FLOOD AND MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS NECESSARY TO MEET THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE FOR FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THAT CONTEXT THIS FIRST FLOOD PROPOSAL REQUESTS NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SPLIT BETWEEN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AND ONE FOR FLOOD PROJECTS IN SOLANO SUTTER YOLO COLUSA SAN JOAQUIN AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES. THE PROJECTS INCLUDE SET BACK LEVEES FIX IN PLACE LEVY PROJECTS RESTORATION OF EXISTING WEIR'S AN OUTFALL GATES AND FLOOD CONTROL SETTING SETTLING BASIN WORK. THESE PROJECTS ARE MULTI BENEFIT IN THAT THEY ADDRESS FLOOD MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND WATER QUALITY ISSUES OTHER. RG IT PROJECTS BENEFIT BOTH BIG AND SMALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY. DO WE TAKE THESE ISSUES ONE BY ONE THE ONE HAVE CONVERSATION ON THIS FIRST PART OF GO THROUGH THE REMAINING FLOOD PROPOSALS FOR THROUGH THE PROVOCATIONS. A ISSUE TWENTY ONE ARE URBAN FLOOD RISK REDUCTION- AMERICAN RIVER COMMON FEATURES. OF THE FORTY SIX MILLION AND GENERAL FUND- IN THIS ISSUE WILL SUPPORT THE AMERICAN RIVER WORK UNDERTAKEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE SACRAMENTO AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY. THE FUNDING WILL SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEVY IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE EAST LEVY OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER DOWNSTREAM OF THE AMERICAN RIVER. SEVERAL OTHER LEVY AND EROSION CONTROL PROJECTS IN THE AMERICAN RIVER SYSTEM AND THE WIDENING OF THE SACRAMENTO WE'RE AND BYPASS TO DELIVER MORE FLOOD FLOWS INTO THE YOLO BYPASS. ESSENTIALLY OF THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT LEVERAGES A ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO REALIZE THESE PROJECTS. OTHER THING TO ADD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED SCHEDULING OUT- THESE PROJECTS IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS REQUESTED IN PREVIOUS YEARS SO THAT WILL BE HELPFUL INFORMATION. OKAY. MEMBERS THIS IS ISSUES TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE IF I COULD ASK THAT WE CALL OUR MISSING MEMBERS SO THAT THEY KNOW.
