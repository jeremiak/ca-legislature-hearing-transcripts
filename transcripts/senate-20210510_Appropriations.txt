THIS IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE AND- PLEASE TELL US ABOUT SB FIVE FIVE NINE. FOUR FIVE GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO PRESENT BUT I WANT TO REALLY STRESS THE URGENCY OF SB FIVE FIVE NINE- YOU SEE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PREVENT. POTENTIALLY FAMINE HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND- ONE THAT COULD FIND YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND MIND SEARCHING FOR FOOD. THEY CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD AS PRICES GO UP IN RESPONSE TO DECREASED WATER ACCESS AND INCREASED COST IN GETTING FOOD. WHERE IT'S GOING FROM FARMS TO GROCERY STORES AND EVENTUALLY OUR DINNER TABLES. MY BILL SB FIVE FIVE NINE THE STATE WATER RESILIENCY ACT CAN HELP US PREVENT FAMINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LAST SESSION I INTRODUCED A BILL OF THE SAME NUMBER THE REQUESTED FUNDING TO RESTORE. THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE FRANKLIN CANAL. THAT BILL WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT STARTED A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY WHEN WE HAVE IT TO REPAIR MUCH NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT CAN BETTER PREPARE US FOR OUR WATER NEEDS IN DROUGHT AND NON DROUGHT YEARS. IN RECENT DECADES THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE WISE DECISIONS AND INVEST. TO INVEST IN REPAIRING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE PROCREATION OF OVER ONE BILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW. AT BAY BRIDGE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND- THOUGH THE BRIDGE WAS DELAYED IN OPENING AND COST SIGNIFICANTLY. MORE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATE THE STATE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE MOST. BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRAVELED BRIDGES IN OUR STATE AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO REPAIR. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FAMILY WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NO LESS IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE AND ALL OF US. THAT LIVE HERE WE GROW CROPS THAT FEED US AND THE WORLD. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SECURING OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN THIS IS WATER USE BY RESIDENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND BY URBAN USERS. AND LOS ANGELES APPROXIMATELY THIRTY ONE MILLION. SOME OF WHO LIVE IN OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 60% OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY RECEIVES WATER THROUGH THE THROUGH THE COMPLAINTS PROJECTS IN THIS BILL. THIS WATER ALSO PROTECTS THE LARGEST REMAINING WETLAND COMPLEX IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WHICH IS HOME TO OVER ONE MILLION MIGRATING BIRDS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE. HOWEVER WITH THAT BEING SAID LET'S NOT DISCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS LEGISLATION WILL HAVE ON OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY EITHER. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS JUST FIFTEEN CROPS. PROVIDE 90% OF THE WORLD'S FOOD ENERGY AND TAKE. WITH THREE WHEAT MAIZE AND RICE MAKING UP TWO THIRDS OF THIS CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER TWO IN RICE PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES PROVIDING FOOD SECURITY. THE DROUGHT HOWEVER HAS CAUSED AT LEAST WHAT WE KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF RICE TO BE PUT OUT OF PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. THAT'S MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF RICE THAT ARE LOST. BERMAN CONTRIBUTES ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S WITHOUT COUNTING FOR THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA WE RECOGNIZE OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND HAVE ACTED TO ENSURE THEY HAVE STAYED STRONG. AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. TO FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS RICHARD THOSE PRODUCTION STAY HERE THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND I SUPPORTED WE NEED THOSE JOBS IN OUR STATE. BUT JUST LIKE OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS A WORLD LEADER THREE OF THE FOUR LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. ARE IN MY SENATE DISTRICT WE NEED THE JOBS THIS INDUSTRY SUPPORTS TO PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS THE FOOD THAT THIS INDUSTRY PRODUCES. IN THE NATION NEEDS THIS FOOD SB FIVE FIVE NINE PROVIDES US THE OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE BUT TO PROTECT IT AS WELL. THE BILL REQUEST SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND CANAL CONVEYANCE REPAIRS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. REPAIRS WILL PROVIDE A NET BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE STATE.
