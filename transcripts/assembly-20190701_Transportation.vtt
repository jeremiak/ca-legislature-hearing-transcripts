00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.341
STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:06.643
VEHICLE EMISSIONS.

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.844
THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY HELP

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.679
MANY FLEETS BY STOPPING LOWER

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:10.847
AND OPERATORS THAT HAVE

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:12.215
POLLUTING VEHICLES FROM UNDER

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:13.549
UNDER CUTTING THEIR MORE

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:16.252
PROFESSIONAL OPERATIONS.

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.553
AND THIS BILL IS DONE IN A

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.289
SENSIBLE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE A

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.990
LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY SYSTEM

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.425
AND IT SETS OUT A STREAMLINED

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:25.094
PROCESS FOR FLEETS THAT HAVE AN

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.562
ESTABLISHED COMPLIANCE HISTORY.

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:27.830
SO WE KNOW THE CARD WOULD

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.098
DEVELOP THE PROGRAM THROUGH A

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:31.534
FULL REAL MAKING INCLUDING A

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.937
PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHEN

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:35.705
OTHER ISSUES COULD BE -- WORKED

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.974
OUT IN DETAIL SO IN SUMMARY THE

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.242
BILL PROVIDES A WORKABLE

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.743
APPROACH TO TAMPING DOWN ON

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.645
GROSS POLLUTERS WHILE AVOIDING

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.147
UNNECESSARY RED TAPE.

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.748
AND NO FLEET OPERATORS SHOULD BE

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.383
ALLOWED TO CIRCUMVENT VEHICLES

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.818
THE STATE'S VEHICLE EMISSION

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:51.220
STANDARDS SB TWO TEN WILL ENSURE

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.689
PARITY ACROSS ALL INDUSTRY

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:55.391
STAKEHOLDERS AND THEREFORE WE

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:55.992

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.595

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:00.463
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BILL AGAIN

SUPPORT AND WE THANK CENTER

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.233
LEYVA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.702
FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.603
THROWN IN WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.005
HIS WORK ON THE BILL.

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.040
I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:11.975
VIRTUALLY ALL OF YOUR

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.377
CONSTITUENTS WOULD BE SHOCKED.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.213
IF THEY KNEW THAT THERE IS NO

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.016
SMOG CHECK FOR TRUCKS ALREADY.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.517
THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:22.652
INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:25.288
PROGRAM FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.256
THAT'S ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE HAVE

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.992
WITH OUR CARS WE KNOW ONCE THEY

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.727
REACH A CERTAIN AGE WE HAVE TO

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.161
GO THROUGH A SMOG CHECK.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.330
AND THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OF

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.132
COURSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.500
EMISSIONS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.735
GETTING ON THE ROAD.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:42.305
ARE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.340
WHEN THE ENGINE IS CERTIFIED.

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.142
IT'S ODD THAT WE HAVE THIS SMOG

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.378
CHECK FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES BUT

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.146
NOT FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS GIVEN

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:51.447
THAT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM CENTER

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:54.117
LEYVA AND FROM SENATOR SKINNER.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.818
MOST OF THE MAJOR AIR POLLUTANTS

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.053
ACTUALLY ARE COMING FROM THE

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.222
MOVEMENT OF GOODS RATHER THAN

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.523
THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.359
AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN FOUND THAT

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:04.927
FOR SOME OF THESE TRUCKS THE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.196
EMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY UP TO

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.698
NINE TIMES ON THE ROAD.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.466
WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:11.734
WHEN THE ENGINE WAS CERTIFIED

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.202
AND THE WHOLE POINT OF AN

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.604
INSPECTION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.206
IS TO CATCH THAT AND FIX IT AND

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.374
WE THINK IT WILL BE?

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.710
A SMALL MINORITY OF THE TRUCKS

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.211
THAT ARE ON THE ROAD THAT ARE

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.080
ACTUALLY GENERATING MOST OF THE

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.148
POLLUTION.

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:27.383
HAVING THIS MEASURE IS -- AN

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.185
IMPORTANT PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.054

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.265
PUTTING THIS IN PLACE IS ALREADY

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.666

HAVE A LITTLE OUT LIST OF

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.306
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE VEHICLES

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.108
CAN BE INSPECTED -- THE MOBILE

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.210
INSPECTORS ARE DEFINITELY ON ONE

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.645
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.513
TELEMATICS DONGLES WHICH

SO WE HAVE A WHOLE MENU OF OF

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.228
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO I THINK

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.696
CANDIDLY A LOT OF THAT WILL

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.164

AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN AFFORD TO

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:53.302
IMPLEMENT BUT I THINK THE MOST

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.837

DOING A MOBILE TESTING SO WE

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.946

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:11.253
WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY INTEND TO

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.889

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:03.945
AT THIS TIME BUT WE ARE

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:05.680
ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. TO MAKING

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:06.915
SURE WE HAVE A PATH TO

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:08.950
COMPLIANCE I THINK ONE OF THE

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:09.718
ISSUES THAT WOULD BE MOST

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.520
HELPFUL WOULD BE THE MOBILE UNIT

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:13.121
BUT YES WE ABSOLUTELY SHARE YOUR

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.756
CONCERN AND WE WANT TO GET TO A

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.358
PATH TO COMPLIANCE SO THAT.

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.093
IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE I WORRY

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.629
ABOUT -- AS BEING A SMALL FARMER

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.364

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:23.398
MACHINERY.

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.699
THAT WE DON'T DRIVE THAT OFTEN

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.835
THAT TO GET TO GET TO A SMOG

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:28.403
INSPECTION IS.

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:30.072
LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOBILE

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.040
UNIT WOULD BE PERFECT BUT I WANT

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.942

PERFECT FOR EVERYONE MAYBE NOT

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.299

IN CHINO I REMEMBER SMOG DAYS I

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.277
REMEMBER NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.712
THE MOUNTAINS TODAY WE SEE THE

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.547
MOUNTAINS MORE OFTEN BUT BECAUSE

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.849
THE PARTICULATES ARE SO SMALL.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.684
THEY ARE JUST AS HARMFUL AND WE

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.919

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.957
HOW TO COMPLY BUT ASK THEM HOW

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.258
THEY CAN COMPLY?

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:33.261
IS IS IMPERATIVE -- WHEN WE LOOK

TRUCKING INDUSTRY.

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.656

DISTRIBUTED. TO THE COMMITTEE

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:13.065
LATE LAST WEEK -- SO.

02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:13.833
NOW THIS HAS TO DO WITH

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:14.767
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN THE

02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:15.901

NOW THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:27.046
POSITIVES RIGHT THIS INNOVATIVE

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.447
TECHNOLOGY COULD DRASTICALLY

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:30.082
REDUCE.

02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:31.550
COLLISIONS ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.719
VERY PROMISING -- BUT I THINK

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.454
THERE'S A FEAR THAT IF NOT PROP

02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:37.189
AND NOT THOUGHTFULLY DEPLOYED

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:39.091
THIS MOBILITY REVOLUTION.

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:39.925
I COULD HAVE SOME NEGATIVE

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:41.293
IMPACTS SOME SIGNIFICANT EGGMAN

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.029
IMPACT INCLUDING EXACERBATING

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:44.296
ALL CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY SEVERE

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.732
CLIMATE AIR QUALITY PLANNING AND

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:48.267
CONGESTION.

02:01:48.334 --> 02:01:48.834
CHALLENGES.

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.136
THE MEDIA ONE EXAMPLE THERE WAS

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:53.105
A AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY

02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:54.907
FOLKS YOU SEE DAVIS BERKELEY.

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:56.742
AND GEORGE ATTACK AND THEY MIMIC

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.310
TO LIFE.

02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.845
WITH THE NAVY -- BASICALLY YOU

02:01:59.912 --> 02:02:01.380
KNOW PROVIDING EVERYONE WITH --

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:02.715
EVERY PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLD

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.750
WITH THE SHOW FOR AN EXPERIMENT

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:05.951
SHOWED THAT THE HOUSEHOLDS

02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:08.888
TRAVELED. 83% MORE MILES PER

02:02:08.954 --> 02:02:10.790
WEEK -- WITH MORE THAN A FIFTH

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.358
OF THE VEHICLE TRIPS ACTUALLY

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:14.427
CARRY NO PASSENGERS AT ALL --

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:15.227
BECAUSE IT'S SO CONVENIENT JUST

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:17.329
TO HAVE A DRIVERLESS CAR YOU

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:18.597
KNOW THAT AND AND THE YOU WOULD

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:20.399
YOU BASICALLY USE IT MORE.

02:02:20.466 --> 02:02:21.734
AND THEY WOULD OFTEN TIMES --

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.869
HAVE THE CAR LOOK JUST CIRCLE

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:25.871
ROUND AND ROUND WAITING FOR THEM

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:27.807
AS OPPOSED TO PARKING -- SO AS

02:02:27.873 --> 02:02:29.275
TO BE ABLE TO BE READY AND

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.676
AVAILABLE TO PICK THEM UP WHEN

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:32.344
THEY'RE READY TO GO WITHOUT OF

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:34.113
COURSE INCREASED CONGESTION.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:35.715
SO -- THERE COULD BE SOME

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.149
DOWNSIDES TO THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:39.018
NOT SMART ABOUT IT AND I THINK --

02:02:39.085 --> 02:02:40.286
WITH ME TO ONE OF THE THINGS WE

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:42.054
WERE LOOKING TO DO WITH SB FIFTY

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:43.322
NINE IS TO CREATE A

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:45.558
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH.

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:46.759
TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND IT

02:02:46.826 --> 02:02:48.060
ULTIMATELY THAT THE THE BILL

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:49.929
CREATES THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:51.731
THE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION. TO

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.932
DELIBERATELY PLANNED FOR

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.200
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY

02:02:54.266 --> 02:02:56.736
THAT SUPPORTS OUR GOALS IN TERMS

02:02:56.802 --> 02:03:01.173
OF SAFETY TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.442
SUSTAINABILITY.

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.643
SO THIS COUNCIL OF CASTLE BRING

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:05.311
TOGETHER STATE LOCAL AGENCIES --

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:05.845

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.380
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL THEN

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:09.982
BE DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:11.550
IT'S AN INTENTIONAL PROCESS AND

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:12.985
IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS CAN HELP

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:13.819
CALIFORNIA.

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:16.021

WITH THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE BEEN

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:20.192

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:21.594
INCLUDING INDUSTRY GROUPS

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.162
AUTOMAKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:25.064

02:22:44.322 --> 02:22:47.125
USED EITHER CELL PHONES OR OTHER --

02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:48.493
MOBILE DEVICES TO SIGN UP FOR

02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:50.728
VARIOUS KINDS OF SERVICES AND

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:52.163
PRODUCTS AND USUALLY YOU GOT TO

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:54.332
SCROLL THROUGH FORTY FIFTY PAGES

02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:55.633
OF LEGAL GOBBLEDYGOOK THAT

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.035
NOBODY READS.

02:22:57.101 --> 02:22:58.937
AND EMBEDDED IN THAT IS THE

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:01.539
OFTEN SO PEOPLE DO NOT READ

02:23:01.606 --> 02:23:02.941
THOSE ELECTRONIC CONSENT FORMS

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:04.242
WE'VE WORKED ON OTHER BILLS

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:05.376
TRYING.

02:23:05.443 --> 02:23:06.811
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPT IN

02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:08.980
CONSENT IS A SEPARATE ACT FROM

02:23:09.047 --> 02:23:10.548
THIS THE ACT OF SIGNING UP FOR

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:13.318
THE SERVICE BUT TYPICALLY IT IS

02:23:13.384 --> 02:23:15.987
EMBEDDED AND NO ONE BOTHERS TO

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.588
LOOK TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:18.890
TO UNCHECK THE OPTION SO THERE'S

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:19.958
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

02:23:20.024 --> 02:23:22.393
THE THE OTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:25.196
IT REVERSES THE ENFORCEMENT

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:25.964
SCHEME.

02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:28.032
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE OF

02:23:28.099 --> 02:23:30.535
VIOLATION OF SOMEONE'S PRIVACY

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:33.204
HAS ENUMERATED MONETARY DAMAGES

02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:34.772
THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL LAWS.

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:36.474
THAT PROVIDE FOR MONETARY

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.843
DAMAGES AND IN MISTER ALLEN'S OF

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.311
STATEMENT THAT THIS DOES NOT

02:23:40.378 --> 02:23:42.046
AFFECT MEDICAL PRIVACY WILL OF

02:23:42.113 --> 02:23:43.648
COURSE IT IS NOT BECAUSE THESE

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:45.216
AGENCIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.151
THAT INFORMATION HOWEVER. ONE

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:47.852
POINT OUT OF OUR RELATIONS

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.053
SOMEONE'S MEDICAL PRIVACY UNDER

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.723
CALIFORNIA LAW SUBJECTS THE THE

02:23:51.789 --> 02:23:54.092
THE VIOLATOR TO ENUMERATED

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:59.831
MONETARY DAMAGES AND MISTER

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.366
ALLEN ALSO SAID HE DOESN'T

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:01.833
CREDIT CARD PRIVACY.

02:24:01.899 --> 02:24:02.700
AGAIN THE SONG BEVERLY CREDIT

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:03.735
CARD ACT WHICH COVERS CREDIT

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.870
CARD PRIVACY DOES ALSO ENUMERATE

02:24:05.937 --> 02:24:07.338
MONETARY DAMAGES SERVICE SO YOU

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:08.039
TO WRAP IT UP OKAY SO THE

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:09.874
REVERSAL OF THAT SCHEME WOULD A

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:12.310
RADIC KATE THE ACCESS TO JOBS AS

02:24:12.377 --> 02:24:13.644
MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH I WANT TO

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:14.379
POINT OUT.

02:24:14.445 --> 02:24:16.948
RETROACTIVITY IS A VERY VERY

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:19.117
SERIOUS MATTER IS POINTED OUT IN

02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:22.153
THE UP IN THE ANALYSIS THIS IS

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:25.023
AN EFFORT TO IMPACT CURRENT

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.157

TOLL VIOLATIONS.

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:06.097
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MOST

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:07.365
NOTICES THAT WERE SENT TO THEM

02:25:07.432 --> 02:25:08.833

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.636
AND MY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.171

DIFFERENT BILL NOT IN TWO

02:25:25.983 --> 02:25:26.551
THOUSAND TEN BUT IN TWO THOUSAND

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:28.820
AND TWO AT THAT.

02:25:28.886 --> 02:25:31.756
SECTION OF THE BILL REQUIRES THE

MAIL NOTICES RETURNED

02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:46.170
UNDELIVERABLE IS THAT THEY DO

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:47.538
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH THEM.

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:49.707

02:25:49.774 --> 02:25:52.076
ACCRUING EVEN THOUGH IT'S KNOWN

02:25:52.143 --> 02:25:53.845
TO THE AGENCIES THAT THE MAIL

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.546

02:25:55.613 --> 02:25:57.849
THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY EXPLAINS

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.350
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BEST

THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:17.135
THAT ARE SORT OF DROPPED INTO

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:19.370
THIS BILL WHICH MOSTLY CONCERNS

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:20.771

FACIA EVIDENCE OF PAST EFFORTS.

AND THAT OPENS A WHOLE HOST OF

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:41.759
PROBLEMS.

02:26:41.826 --> 02:26:42.860
THAT ARE GOING TO BE FACED IN

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:45.096
FURTHER LITIGATION AS TO WHAT IT

02:26:45.163 --> 02:26:45.997
WOULD MEAN.
