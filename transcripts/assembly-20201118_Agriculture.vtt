ADD TO AGRICULTURE IN THE FIRST

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.792
THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT-

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.428

THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAVE A

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.123
VERY HARD TIME THINKING OF IN

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:41.725
TERMS A DOLLARS AND CENTS. AND

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.160

ARE AFFECTED BY TRAGIC LOSSES

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.468
SO THIS IS ALSO AN AGRICULTURAL

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:53.537
ISSUE BUT AGAIN IT'S ONE THAT

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:57.608
I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO QUANTIFY

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.310

CAN HAVE ALREADY SOME CAL. OF

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:13.157
EAGLE LOSSES. BUT THE THINGS

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.625
THAT WERE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:16.927

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:27.271
THAT THEY HAD SOME. OF UP AMONG.

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:30.174
WAS THE SMOKE DAMAGE. NOT JUST

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.713
IT. COURSE SMOKE DAMAGE- IS IN

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:39.350
THREAT. TO HELP ON. DAYS IN THE

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:42.419
LIKE. AND I JUST WANT TO SHOULD.

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.321
MAKE THE THAT FORMER ARE AMONG

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:45.155
THE- THAT ARE OUT THERE EVERY

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:47.624

ALSO WITH THAT ERIC. AND YET.

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:55.432
IF THE CROPS ARE GOING TO BE

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:57.001
HARPER AT THE- OF ARE GOING TO.

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:57.968
SOMEBODY'S TO BE OUT THERE

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:00.204
DOING IT I WANT TO SEE. THAT

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.804
YEAH I'LL SPEND A LITTLE MORE

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:03.607
TIME I HAVE NO QUAN OF THOSE.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.509
OF ECONOMIC Mà ARE THEY- WE

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:08.445
KNOW HOW DO IT A- GOOD AT IT-

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.280
IN BAR ECONOMY WORKING A GROUP.

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:11.849
ECONOMIST BUT IT HAS BEEN DONE

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.051
AS FAR AS I KNOW FOR A TWENTY

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.986
TWENTY. OF FARMWORKER- IMPACT

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:23.227
OF A BETTER QUALITY. ALL WE DO

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.762
NOT YET HAVE A TO DATE ACCURATE

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:27.231
ASSESS FOR TWENTY. THEREFORE

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:28.298
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GO BACK.

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:29.666
UP TO LOW AT IT WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:31.635
SAY ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.003
FIRES WERE WEAK THERE HAS BEEN

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.671
MORE CALCULATIONS DONE WITH

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:38.809
OBJECTIVE DATA. AND SOME WELL

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:39.410
WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE COMPLETE

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.945
INFORMATION- AGGREGATE

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:43.580
ASSESSMENTS ARE NEEDED OF

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.483
COURSE AND- THEN THEY NEED TO

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.918
USE OBJECTIVE MODELING AND

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:49.920
DETAILED DATA. TO CALCULATE

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.755
LOST INCOME AND WEALTH AND ALSO

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.791
JOBS AND I THINK THAT'S-

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:56.026
SOMETHING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:58.328
EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SET OF

00:44:58.395 --> 00:44:59.830
FAIRLY DRY CALCULATIONS. WELL

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:02.066
LET ME START WITH A COUPLE OF-

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:03.700
FACTS AND FIGURES JUST TO PUT

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:05.736
ALL OF THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. A

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:07.638
CALIFORNIA'S PRODUCING ABOUT

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.339
FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:11.408
AGRICULTURAL INCOME EVERY YEAR.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:13.210
THAT SALES OF AGRICULTURAL

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:15.479
PRODUCTS- IT VERY TO GOES UP

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.448
AND DOWN DEPENDING ON PRICES

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.950
AND WHAT THE WEATHER GIVES US.

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:22.219
ALL HOPE THAT ABOUT THE TWELVE

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:22.986
POINT THREE BILLION IS PAID TO

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:26.090
EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACT LABOR SO

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:26.990
A BIG CHUNK OF THAT GOES TO THE

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.593
WORKERS. ALL BUT DOT NET

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.395
RETURNS TO FARMERS OR ABOUT TEN

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:34.531
BILLION. AND THE REST GOES FOR

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:38.068
A- ALL EXPENSES ON FORM SO THAT

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:42.239
THE NET IS A LOT SMALLER THAN

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:43.140
THE GROSS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:45.209
THE RESOURCE BASED ON THIS OF

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:47.277
AG. DATA WHICH IS THE BEST WE

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.680
HAVE WHICH IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.649
WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:53.817
THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.953
THE VALUE AND FARMLAND AND

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.321
RANGE AND BUILDINGS AND THE

00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:00.057
LIKE MOST OF THAT LAND BUT OUR

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:02.059
SISTER SUBSTANTIAL PART IS

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.695
OTHER REALESTATE- BUILT REAL

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:08.899
ESTATE. MACHINERY IS ABOUT.

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.001
BILLION DOLLARS TERMS OF

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.903
FARMLAND WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.771
FIVE MILLION ACRES ABOUT EIGHT

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.039
MILLION OF THAT IS THE

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:18.942
HARVESTED CROPLAND ABOUT

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.444
THIRTEEN MILLION AS PASTOR AND

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.779
THEN THERE'S ADDITIONAL

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:25.782
ACREAGE- AS WELL. BOB DRAWING

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.351
THE LINE BETWEEN AGRICULTURE

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.286
AND THE REST THE COMMIES NOT

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:30.787
EASY HERE I'M GONNA FOCUS WE

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:31.755
DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME I'M GONNA

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:33.624
FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON FARM

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.993
LOSSES I'M NOT GOING TO PROVIDE

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:37.794
DATA ON LOSSES IN PROCESSING

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.596
AND MARKETING WE KNOW THAT PART

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:42.132
OF AGRICULTURE IT IS VERY HARD

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:43.901
TO SEPARATE AGRICULTURAL

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.369
PROCESSING SAY FROM OTHER

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.304
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES FOOD

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:49.773
PROCESSING IS OFTEN INCLUDED

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.341
WITHIN AGRICULTURE BUT IT'S

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.943
ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN THE

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.444
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:57.214
I'M GONNA FOCUS ON SOME TWENTY

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:57.814
SEVENTEEN NUMBERS TO GIVE US

00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:00.050
EXAMPLES TO WORK WITH. AND ALL

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:01.919
START WITH VENTURA ALL WERE THE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.654
THOMAS FIRE WHICH AFFECTED NOT

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.955
JUST BEEN TOUR BUT SURROUNDING

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:06.423
AREAS AS WELL INCLUDING SANTA

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.258

COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:12.529
MADE SOME ESTIMATES RIGHT AWAY

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:15.799
ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.034
PASTURE. ABOUT TENTH ACRES OF

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.869
IRRIGATED CROPLAND IN THIS SORT

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.571
OF PATTERN MOSTLY IT'S PAST

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.472
YOUR LAND. IS TRUE FOR ALL THE

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.575
WILDFIRES THAT I'VE LOOKED AT.

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:27.144
OR ALMOST ALL OF THE BIG ONES.

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:28.078
OUT THERE OF THE THOMAS FIRE

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:30.047
THERE WERE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:30.914
ACRES OF AVOCADOS THAT WERE

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:33.584
AFFECTED. ALSO CITRUS. THESE

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.452
ARE VERY HIGH VALUE CROPS THAT

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.020
ARE AFFECTED THAT WERE AFFECTED

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.423
BY THAT THOMAS FIRE FIRE. THE

GENERAL- CALIFORNIA MAKES A

00:47:57.674 --> 00:47:58.809

ECONOMIC DAMAGE OF FIRES

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:10.020
HAPPENS WITH THAT A DAMAGE TO

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:15.225
STRUCTURES. BOB IN THE THOMAS

THAT HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.180
MOST WOULD BE HARDEST. BY THE

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:41.051
TIME I A FOR IN NOVEMBER. IT

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.185
BUT THAT'S TRUE FOR CITRUS OF

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:46.256

THE CAMPFIRE AND NOW THE NORTH

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.924
LIGHTNING COMPLEX WHICH STRUCK

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.926
ME VERY CLOSE TO HOME IN THE

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.628
PAST THIRTY YEARS I PROBABLY

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.397
HAD TEN TO FIFTEEN FIRES ON MY

WE'RE GETTING TO A GREATER

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.107
DESTRUCTION AS THESE FIRES

ARRIVED AND I'M REALLY NOT HERE

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.378
WORRY ABOUT WHY IT'S LET'S DO

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:26.214
SOMETHING AND IN THIS CASE THEN

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:27.983
THE NORTH LIGHTNING COMPLEX

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.217
WHICH WE CALL THE BARE FIRE THE

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.752
TIME CAME SO QUICKLY THROUGH

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:33.088
OUR MOUNTAIN RANGE. THAT WITHIN

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:36.024
ABOUT TWELVE HOURS A DAY OVER

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.225
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES AND

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:39.160
THAT INCLUDED- THE MAJORITY MY

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:41.263
CAL HEARD ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.564
COWS AND THEIR CALVES WERE

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.600
KILLED IN THE FIRE- THAT IS NOT

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.303
ALL- PRIVATE LAND IT'S HALF

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.171
FEDERAL AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.072
POINT OUT THAT THIS ISSUE IS

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.073
CERTAINLY NOT JUST A STATE

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.241
ISSUE IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE AS

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:54.743
WELL IT'S THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.077
NATIONAL FORESTS I HAVE PERMITS

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:57.712
ON THE PLUMAS NATIONAL FOREST

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.014
AS WELL AS LEASED LAND WITH

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.615
SIERRA PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL A

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.350
GREAT LOGGING TIMBER FIRM THAT

AND IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.822
ALL THAT LAND WAS GONE IN ABOUT

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.057
TWELVE HOURS I THINK IT'S

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.425
IMPORTANT AS A CATTLEMAN TO

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.427
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SITUATION

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.229
TENDS TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.664
THAN AS WE'VE HEARD FROM

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.098
VINEYARDS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH ARE

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.267
HIGH DOLLAR- PER ACRE BUT IN

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.502
THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS NOT

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.770
ONLY US THAT SUMMER AND THE

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:22.937
LOSS OF TEMPER IT'S THE

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.739
WILDLIFE IN ITS ENVIRONMENT.

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.908
THAT PARTICULAR FIRE IS BETWEEN

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:27.809
THE SOUTH FORK IN THE MIDDLE

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:32.947
FORK OF THE FEATHER. RIVER

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:33.515
WHICH IS A DRAINAGE FOR LIKE

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.115
ORVILLE. HE WHAT'S GOING TO

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.250
THIS YEAR IT DOES RAIN. LET'S

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:36.084
GO TO HAPPEN TO LIKE OR BILL

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:37.786
THAT JUST IN. ME PER. BUT

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:39.321
IMPACTS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.056
FRANKLY THE ENTIRE STATE WE SEE

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:44.359
THAT- I WE HAD A SMALL RAIN

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:45.427
YESTERDAY AND I'M REALLY HAPPY

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:47.128
WITH THAT RAIN. WE GET ONE OF

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.530
THE MAJOR ONES LIKE ORACLE'S

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.065
GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT PLACE.

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.499
IN TERMS OF POLLUTION IN THE

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:52.500
RUNOFF THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.202
THERE. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.538
CASE OUR CATTLE WERE. KILLED IN

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:57.739
SOME PRETTY HORRIFIC

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.675
CIRCUMSTANCES- IT'S DIFFICULT

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:03.178
TO WATCH. AND TO SEE WE HAD TO

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:05.080
GAIN ACCESS WHICH WAS DIFFICULT

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.315
TO DO BUT WHEN WE DID. WE ARE

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:09.284
STILL AN ACTIVE FIRE ZONE. AND

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:10.885
WHAT WE WOULD FIND WERE CATTLE

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.920
THAT WERE BURNT TRYING TO GET

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:14.723
AWAY- AND SOME OF THE PICTURES-

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.358
RIFIC YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:17.792
THOSE WERE PUBLISHED. BUT WHEN

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.461
YOU WALK UP ON A GROUP OF EIGHT

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.296
CHAO'S WITH THREE BABY CAST BUT

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.764
WHEN I REPEAT ROUTINE AND

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:26.167
BURNT- BEYOND RECOGNITION. MY

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.702
DAUGHTER IS A VETERINARIAN MY

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.371
SON'S SOLD MY YOUNG SON SOLDIER

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:31.005
THE OLDEST ONE RANCHERS WITH ME

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.141
ALL THREE WERE HELPING. AND

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.442
WE'RE HOME AT THE TIME THEY GOT

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.177
THERE SOON AS THEY COULD. TO

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.912
HAVE AN ACTIVE FIRE IN THE

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.848
BOTTOM OF CREEK. AND CAL WITH

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:44.085
THEIR LEGS BURNED OFF. I'M

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:44.652
SORRY TO BE GRAPHIC IN STILL

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:45.920
LIFE. AND MICE EUTHANIZE- AND

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.422
HE WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR OTHER

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:48.456
CATTLE OF THE TIME SEE IF

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.023
THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THERE

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.959
IT'S SO SMOKY. MY DAUGHTER SAW

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:52.761
A CATHOLIC INSIDE OF HER.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.429
INDEED AN EMERGENCY C. SECTION

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:55.897
WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE.

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.665
THAT'S A RIFIC. AND THAT'S WHAT

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.167
WE'RE DEALING WITH AGRICULTURE

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:01.102
IN SO IT IS AN ECONOMIC LOSS

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.237
AND I GET THAT BUT THIS IS A

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.072
LOSS TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA. I

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.341
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE.

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.542
THIS IS NOT A LEFT AND RIGHT

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:09.711
ISSUE. AT ALL. THIS IS

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.679
CALIFORNIA ISSUE AND WE NEED TO

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:12.647
WORK ON IT. FROM THAT

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.649
PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK TOO

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:18.920
OFTEN WE GET INTO CAMPS. IS

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:19.421
THIS CLIMATE CHANGES AS

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.188
MANAGEMENT I DON'T CARE. DO

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:22.023
SOMETHING. RIGHT I THINK

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.525
THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:24.259
DIFFERENCES AND WHAT I HAVE

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.294
SEEN OVER TIME HE MY PARTICULAR

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.962
INSTANCE. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:29.264
REMEMBER THE PRESCRIBED BURN

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.099
CONTROLLED BURNS WE CALL THEM.

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.468
OR AN ACTIVE TOOL. THEY WERE

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:34.068
TOLD THAT WE COULD USE IN THE

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:36.137
WINTER TIME. AND THE RIGHT

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:38.873
CONDITIONS TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.143
WE STOPPED DOING THAT. TO ANY

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.411
DEGREE PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:44.512
AGO AND EVERY YEAR IS LASTIN

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.448
PART THAT IS A REGULATORY

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.315
ISSUES THAT PREVENT US FROM

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.918
DOING SO. I WOULD DEARLY LOVE

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:52.887
TO SEE- NOT A CHALLENGE

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.023
BETWEEN. CAL FIRE AND AIR

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.424
RESOURCES BOARD OF WHEN WE CAN

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.092
BURN A WIN WE CAN'T BURN. I'D

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.161
LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY SAY OKAY

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:01.963
IT'S THE WINTER TIME MAYBE

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.164
THERE'S AN AIR QUALITY

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.699
CHALLENGE BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:05.867
AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE ONE WE'RE

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.902
GOING TO GET IF IT BURNS FOR

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.070
TWO MONTHS IN THE SUMMER. I'D

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:10.305
LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO HAD THE

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:11.739
AUTHORITY IN THE STATE AT SOME

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:13.775
LEVEL TO SAY. WE'RE GONNA MAKE

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.044
THIS WORK WE'RE GONNA DO MORE

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:18.246
CONTROL FINE FUEL REDUCTION FOR

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.547
FUEL REDUCTION IN THE WINTER

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.949
TIME. THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.183
DO BECAUSE CITIZENRY

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.852
APPROPRIATELY SO ARE PETRIFIED

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.854
OF FIRE. AND THE FUEL LOADS ARE

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.990
pARE AFRAID OF LIABILITY IF I DO

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.191
CONTROL OVER WHAT'S GOING TO

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:32.160
HAPPEN IF IT HAPPENS TO ESCAPE

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.828
WE REALLY NEED AND I TRUST THE

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.163
SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA HELP US

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.664
IN THIS. THE EXPERTS ON THE

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.933
GROUND TO SAY WE CAN BURN AT

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.034
THIS TIME WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:42.504
FUEL LOADS. SECONDARILY GRAZING

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.606
CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THAT.

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:46.541
SCENARIO INFINE FUEL REDUCTION

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:47.208
THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.244
RESEARCH FROM DEBURAU WITH UC

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.012
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION WHICH

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.080
SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF FINE FUELS

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:53.748
A RENEWED BIKE RACING. I THINK

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.184
IT'S KIND OF. ACTUALLY I JUST I

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:57.185
DON'T KNOW IF I WERE USE WHERE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.186
HUMOR IS MAYBE A LITTLE

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:58.987
FRUSTRATING ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.155
GRAZING REGRET SHEEP AND GOATS

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:02.891
IN TOWN IT'S REALLY COOL. AFTER

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:05.026
WE ELIMINATED IT FOR THE LAST

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.227
FIFTY TO SIXTY YEARS. YOU KNOW

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.729
WHEN WE KNEW IT WAS COOL BEFORE

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.497
BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.633
LIKE WELL WE CAN REDUCE FUEL

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.735
LOADS IF WE RAISE WE KNEW THAT.

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:14.802
AND WE MADE IT SO HARD TO DO

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:15.870
THAT PEOPLE ARE UNWILLING TO

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.572
TAKE THAT RISK A LIABILITY

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.741
ECONOMICS THE CHALLENGES. SO IF

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:21.309
I HAD TO REQUEST AND I REALIZE

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:22.911
THESE ARE NOT ONES THAT THIS

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.245
ONE COMMITTEE BY ITSELF WOULD

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.314
BE ABLE TO DO. BUT ONE IS WE

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:27.649
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT PERSON

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:29.551
AT. THE ABILITY TO USE

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:30.818
PRESCRIBED FIRE IN A DIFFERENT

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:32.186
WAY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.888
LIABILITY PROTECTION TO DO SO

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.356
WE NEED TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.525
WITH CAL FIRE. THAT ALLOW US TO

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:41.863
BURN EVEN THOUGH AIR RESOURCES.

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:42.463
BOARD SAY HAND MAYBE A LITTLE

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.264
QUESTIONABLE TODAY. THEN WE

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:44.432
MISS OUT OPPORTUNITY. AND THEN

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:46.467
WE BURN TOWN. A CAMPFIRE.

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.669
PARADISE EIGHTY NINETY PEOPLE

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.871
BURNED. RIGHT BERRY CREEK THE

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:52.307
LITTLE TOWN. IN OUR AREA

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.309
FOURTEEN PEOPLE DIED JUST ABOUT

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:57.045
A MONTH AGO. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.013
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT AGRICULTURE

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.248
THIS IS SOMETHING FAR LARGER

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.149
THAN- I THINK WE HAVE AN

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.518
OPPORTUNITY TO AGREE ON THAT WE

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:05.320
HAVE AN ISSUE IT'S CLIMATE

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.089
CHANGE IT'S A MANAGE BUT IT'S

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.024
BOTH LET'S PUT OVER OUR QUIT

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:11.092
ARGUING ABOUT WHICH IT IS AND

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.026
JUST DO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:14.095
EFFECTIVE. MY COURAGE OF IT AT

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.863
WHATEVER LEVEL YOU CAN DO IS TO

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.198
REALLY TALK TO PEOPLE AND SAY

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:18.566
PRESCRIBED FIRE NEEDS TO BE A

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.735
TOOL LET'S DO IT LET'S USE

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.971
GRAZING ON STATE FEDERAL AND

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.706
MUNICIPAL LANDS INSTEAD OF

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.441
PUTTING BARRIERS IN TO DO THAT

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.208
I THINK IT GIVES US SOME

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:29.010
OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.746

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:06.941
CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE TO

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.710
LIVE AND WORK AND HAVE MORE-

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:11.279
PREDICTABILITY IN OUR FUTURE AS

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:12.246
A AS A STATE AND A COMMUNITY

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.148
CENTER I DO WANT TO START TALK

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.049
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FOR

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.818
REPRESENT AND GIVE SOME CONTEXT

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.186
ABOUT WHAT FARMING LOOKS LIKE

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:18.953
IN CINEMA COUNTY FOR

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.922
WINEGROWERS WITH ABOUT EIGHTEEN

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:21.989
HUNDRED GRAPE GROWERS IN CINEMA

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:24.592
COUNTY AND ALSO MARIN- OUR

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:25.927
LOCAL GRAPE GROWERS FAMILY

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:27.729
FARMERS MULTI GENERATIONAL AND

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.497
THEY'RE ACTUALLY SMALL BUSINESS

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.699
MEN AND WOMEN SO ABOUT 80% OF

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:32.934
OUR LOCAL VINEYARDS ARE LESS

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.002
THAN A HUNDRED ACRES. 40% LESS

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:37.472
THAN TWENTY ACRES SO ONE AT

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.107
LOSS OF CROP ONE YEAR CAN

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.209
REALLY PUT SOME OF OUR FARMERS

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.710
REALLY ON THE FRENCH OF WHETHER

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.011
THERE CAN CONTINUE TO FARM

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.346
WHETHER THEY CAN CONTINUE TO

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:47.215
KEEP OUR FARMS IN AG LAND WHICH

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.249
WE KNOW IS SO IMPORTANT NOT

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.884
ONLY FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD BUT

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:50.451
REALLY FOR THE LANDSCAPE OF

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:53.454
CALIFORNIA- THE ECONOMY AND YOU

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:57.925
KNOW THE FUTURE FAMILY. FAMILY

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:58.860
BUSINESSES SO. EACH OUR FIRE

01:29:58.926 --> 01:29:59.460
SYSTEM REALLY DE WITH THE REAL

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.529
DIFFERENT AND- YOU KNOW TWO

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:02.163
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS URBAN

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.531
FIRE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.766
GROUPS WERE IN MOST OF OUR

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.534
GROUPS WE- WE HAD ABOUT 95% OF

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:08.536
HARVEST DONE- BY THE- OCTOBER

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:10.004
DATE WHEN THE TUBBS FIRE IN THE

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.305
SEVENTEEN FIRES HIT. SO WE

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:12.807
DIDN'T SEE THAT IMPACT REALLY

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:13.775
TO OUR VINEYARDS INTERCROPPING

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.243
IN FACT. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:17.378
WE'VE HEARD OF THE BENEFIT OF

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:19.280
OUR AG LANDS ARE WORKING LANDS

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.015
SLOWING AND STOPPING FIRES.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:21.783
THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOME GOOD

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.117
NEWS IN THE SENSE OF WHAT WAS

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:24.619
HAPPENING WITH AGRICULTURE.

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:26.387
UNFORTUNATE THAT TIME WE HAD A

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.555
FOURTEEN FARMWORKERS LOSE THEIR

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.290
HOME SO. IN THE OTHER WORK THAT

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:30.591
I DO RUNNING THE CINEMA COUNTY

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:33.060
GRIPPERS FOUNDATION- WE WORK TO

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.362
SUPPORT THE SIXTY TWO HUNDRED

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:36.230
OF FULL TIME VINEYARD WORKERS.

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:37.965
THAT WORK IN CINEMA COUNTY THE

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:38.499
THIRTEEN HUNDRED SEASONAL

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:39.734
VINEYARD WORKERS. I'M AS WELL

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:41.469
AS OTHER FARMWORKERS SO. IN

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.671
THAT CASE WE YOU- SUPPORTED US

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.006
FOURTEEN FARMWORKER FAMILIES BY

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.407
PAYING RENT FOR TWO YEARS. WE

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.775
BOUGHT THREE R. V.'S FOR

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.877
TEMPORARY HOUSING. TO TRY TO

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:50.444
GET THROUGH THAT SO IT'S AN

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.346
URBAN FIRE. INTO DOESN'T

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:52.914
EIGHTEEN WE HAD THE KINCAID

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.982
FIRE NOT ONLY DID WE GET

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.217
IMPACTED BY THE POWER SHUT

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.785
OFFS. BUT REALLY THE NORTHERN

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.520
PART OF CINEMA COUNTY WAS

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:00.488
LARGELY IMPACTED IN OUR

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.456
FARMING. AGAIN LATE IN THE YEAR

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:04.458
END OF OCTOBER NOVEMBER SELENA

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.460
HARVEST. SO WE'RE ABOUT 90% OF

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:08.563
OUR CROPS IN IT BUT OUR OUR

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.364
CABERNET SO YOUNG GROWERS. LIKE

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:11.866
OUR NEIGHBORS IN NAPA VALLEY

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:13.701
FELT A BIG IMPACT TO WHAT THAT

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.303
HAPPENED. UNFORTUNATELY FOR

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:16.938
FARMWORKERS WE ACTUALLY HAD

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.072
IMPACT OVER A THOUSAND

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:19.740
FARMWORKERS AND I SEE IMPACT.

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:20.875
WASN'T WE ONLY HAVE FIVE WHOSE

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.243
HOUSES WHICH I GUESS IS A STEP

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.810
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FROM

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:24.779
SEVENTEEN. BUT WE SAW A LOT OF

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.147
LOSS OF THEIR INCOME FROM

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.082
EVACUATIONS FROM LOSS OF WORK

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.317
BECAUSE OF THE FIRE BECAUSE OF

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.318
HOW MUCH TIME THEY HAVE TO

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.686
SPEND AWAY FROM THEIR HOME.

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.820
BECAUSE OF HOW LONG THE CAN

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.322
CADE FIRE AND THE SUBSEQUENT

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:38.960
EVACUATIONS HOW WIDESPREAD.

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:39.594
THEY WERE. I IN OUR COMMUNITY.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.394
AND THEN TWENTY TWENTY HAPPENED.

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:41.596
I THINK WHEN WE THOUGHT WE- HAD

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.364
SEEN IT ALL WE HAD. JUST BARELY

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.665
SEE IN THE BEGINNING OF WHAT

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:45.299
THE IMPACT COULD BE TO

01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:46.934
AGRICULTURE. AND OUR FROM OUR

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:50.137
COMMUNITY. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY-

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:51.172
PART OF THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.406
IT JUST HAPPENED IN CINEMA

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:53.641
COUNTY AND NOT THEN ARE AND THE

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.309
NORTH BAY. IS THAT WE SAW THIS

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:58.079
YOU KNOW. TRUMP TRAGEDY AND-

01:31:58.145 --> 01:31:59.347
FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.848
DIFFERENT WINE REGIONS. WHICH

01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:02.683
REALLY EXASPERATED THE ISSUES

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:03.985
FOR A LOCAL GRAPE GROWERS AND

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:06.153
OUR VENDOR PARTNERS. SO TWENTY

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.856
TWENTY- YOU KNOW THE ABOUT

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.491
1415% OF OUR CROP IS IN WHEN

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:11.259
THE FIRST START FIRE STARTED IN

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:13.661
AUGUST. AND SO WE SAW SO MANY

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.096
OF OUR CROPS OF IMPACT. BY

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:17.031
SMOKE EXPOSURE. AND ONE OF THE

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.299
BIG ISSUES WAS NOT GOING TO GET

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.600
THE TESTING DONE IN TIME NOT

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.401
HAVING ENOUGH TESTING

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.703
RESOURCES. WE JUST AGREE OF

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:25.139
COURSE TO- TO- TO INFORM US

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.340
ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.442
HARVEST REJECT- CROP WOULD BE.

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:29.377
WELL GONE HARVESTED WILL BE

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.712
REJECTED. AND THEY SAID ABOUT

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.080
25230% OF WHAT THAT EQUATES TO

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.649
ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OF

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:35.917
GRAPES IN SONOMA COUNTY WENT.

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.586
ON HARVESTED. OUT OF ABOUT A

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:39.153
HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TON

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.321
AVERAGE CROP. THE FINANCIAL

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.622
IMPACT OUR LOCAL FARMERS AND

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:42.657
THAT IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.091
MILLION DOLLARS. WHEN YOU LOOK

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:45.092
AT THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES THAT

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:47.028
DIDN'T GET- HARVESTED. THAT'S

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.095
JUST LOCALLY IN THE AGAIN THESE

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:50.231
ARE SMALL. BUSINESSMEN AND

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:52.300
WOMEN. ARE ARE BARELY YOU KNOW

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:53.334
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON ON THEIR

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.569
FARM OR TRYING TO EMPLOYEE. THE

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:57.705
FARMERS. WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:32:57.772 --> 01:32:59.407
FORMER FOR FAMILIES IMPACTED-

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:01.542
AND- AGAIN TO OF OUR LOCAL

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:02.677
FARMER FAMILIESLOST THEIR

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.645
HOMES. AND INTO TWENTY TWENTY

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.480
FIRES. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.349
THE TRICKLE DOWN IMPACT SO WE

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.318
KNOW DURING HARVEST- ARE

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:11.185
FARMWORKERS OUR VINEYARD

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.954
WORKERS ARE MAKING. YOU KNOW

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.221
THIRTY DOLLARS PLUS AN HOUR

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:15.423
BECAUSE WE CHANGED TO A PIECE

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:17.058
RATE. SO WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM.

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.026
LOST THAT WORK FOR THOSE COUPLE

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.328
OF WEEKS SORTS TYPICALLY WOULD

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:22.163
BE THAT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THEIR

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.464
SEASON IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.066
SUPPORT. SORT TRYING TO HAVE A

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:26.701
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT.

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.102
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WE KNOW

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.537
IT WAS NOT HARVESTED BUT WE

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:30.104
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRICKLE

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:31.739
DOWN IMPACT WILL BE. OF OUR

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.240
VENDORS NUMBERS WORK TOGETHER

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.176
TO BRING IN GRAPES. IN MAY NOT

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:39.880
OF AND- SUBSEQUENTLY CRUSH RIND

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.215
IT MAY NEVER OR GET MADE INTO.

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:42.383
AND SO AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO- IN

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.517
TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:45.686
DO. ONE WHEN WE NEED HELP WITH

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.488
ALL OF THE INSURANCE ISSUES IN

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:48.756
THE LAND MANAGEMENT THAT. MY

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.291
PREVIOUS PALACES SPOKEN ABOUT

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:52.026
SO I WON'T TOUCH ON KNOWS. THE

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.060
TO SPECIFIC AREAS THAT ARE

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:54.662
CONCERNING. IS THE FUTURE OF

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.497
GETTING US TESTING FASTER MORE

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:58.899
AVAILABILITY. SO WE HAD SO MUCH

01:33:58.966 --> 01:33:59.767
UNPREDICTABILITY AND WHAT WAS

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.669
HARVESTED- AND WHETHER THOSE

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.770
GROUPS ACTUALLY BE MADE INTO

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:03.771
WINE JUST BECAUSE WE COULDN'T

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.573
GET GOOD TEST RESULTS BACK. IN

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.341
TIME. SO WE TOOK A LOT OF RISK

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.709
ACROSS GOT LEFT ON THE VINE

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:09.477
BECAUSE WONDERS DID WANT TO

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:10.778
TAKE THAT RISK SUCH A FINANCIAL

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.613
IMPACT TO THE FARMERS. AS WELL

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.214
AS A FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.915
FARMWORKERS. THE OTHER THING

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:15.983
THAT'S CONCERNING IS OUR

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:16.984
GROWERS AND MOST OF THEIR

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:19.353
CONTRACTS. ARE BASED ON WHAT

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.956
THE AVERAGE ON CROP RATE IS IN

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:24.792
THE CAR AND THE ANNUAL CROP

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:25.893
REPORT REQUEST REPORT. WE HAVE

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.994
NO IDEA HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.262
TO TERM THIS YEAR WE DON'T KNOW

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.463
WHAT WINERIES ARE GONNA REPORT

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:30.498
TO WE KNOW A LOT OF GROUPS

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.099
DIDN'T GET HARVESTED. WE DON'T

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.601
KNOW WHAT THE VALUE WOULD BE OF

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.268
THOSE GROUPS THAT DID GET

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:35.603
HARVESTED BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.671
WAS A NEGOTIATION. CROP-

01:34:37.738 --> 01:34:39.507
DEDUCTIONS TAKEN. IT'S WE DON'T

HOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. THE

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.891
FUTURE. IS ENSURING THAT OUR

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:33.060

COMMUNITY AS WELL- OF WHICH

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.444
PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF. OF THE

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.111
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.813
STAYING. BEHIND BECAUSE THEY

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.348
RECOGNIZE THEY HAD TO BE THE

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:55.282
ONES TO FIGHT THE FIRE

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:57.518
THEMSELVES. TO A LARGE DEGREE.

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.119
IT MAKING SITUATION A BIT MORE

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:00.554
DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHEN WE

DAYS AFTERWARDS. FROM CATCHING.

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.641

LAND THAT RETAIN MORE MOISTURE

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.351
SO DEALS FOR EXAMPLE COULD BE

TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

THAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT WOULD

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:52.799
BE HELPFUL- LEGISLATIVELY- AS-

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.434
NUMBER FOCUS SPOKEN ON FIRE

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.936
INSURANCE I DON'T WANT TO BE

GOT TO MUCH BECAUSE OUR FOLKS

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:58.438
HAVE BUT THAT'S ALSO A VERY

01:42:58.505 --> 01:42:59.940
CRITICAL THING. FOR US TO BE

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.575
ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO-

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.343

YOU KNOW. HOW DOZEN YEARS OR SO

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:09.583
OF WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE- AND

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:11.818
BEYOND THAT IS- THINKING MORE

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:15.289
ABOUT HOW- WE CAN WE CAN USE

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:17.858
THIS MOMENT TO. INCLUDE FARMERS

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:19.960
RANCHERS IN AND RESTORING A LOT

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:22.195
OF LANDS. THAT HAVE BEEN

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:24.898
DESTROYED- THERE. WE'RE GOING

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:26.266
TO HAVE A NUMBER OF VERY

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.367
SERIOUS RUSSIAN ISSUES IN OUR

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:29.202
AREA AND THERE HASN'T BEEN.

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:31.338
MUCH EFFORT. THUS FAR TO

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:33.907
ADDRESS THAT- I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:35.943
THAT WE CAN USE- FARMERS AND

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:37.411
RANCHERS SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.580
IN TERMS OF. AN EQUIPMENT IN

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:41.515
ADDITION THAT TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:44.184
FOCUS ON RESTORATION. OF A LOT

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.286
OF LANDS AROUND OUR FARMS- I

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:48.221
THINK. THE MORE OF THE STORY IN

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.890
MY OPINION IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.291
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:53.293

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.196
PREPARATION. ACTIVE RESPONSE.

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:58.465
AND RESTORATION PROCESS. AND

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:01.702
HOPE THAT WE CAN. HAVE IT. IN A

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:03.503
CERTAIN DEGREE OF CRAZINESS IN

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:04.071
TERMS OF ORGANIZING HOW THE

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.039
SYSTEMS COULD LOOK. BUT I IN

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:10.043
RURAL COMMUNITIES. LIKE OURS

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:10.844
IT'S ESSENTIAL BECAUSE- AS AS

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:11.979
WE SAW ON THE PARTICULAR.

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:12.512
THEY'RE JUST WEST ENOUGH

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:15.582
REACHED- DIVIDE THE FACT OF THE

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.684
AREA IT JUST REALISTICALLY. IT

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:18.652
WASN'T A CASE IN AND IT IS NOT

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.988

ACTUALLY AEROBIC. BUT I DO

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:30.163
THINK THOUGH THAT WE NEED TO

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.366

CONSUMERS- WHAT THAT. LITTLE

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:58.905
COMPETITION- ED BUT THE BIGGEST

AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSE

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:34.947
IN OUR PARTICULAR COUNTY WE MET

01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:36.349
WITH OUR AG COMMISSIONER'S SEAT

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:38.284
THERE'S A- ROAD MAP THERE. THAT

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:39.886
WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IF WE CAN

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.220
GET THAT CERTIFICATION BUT

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:43.523

AND HAD TO GO CROSS COUNTRY

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:56.269
WHICH IS ACTUALLY MORE

01:57:56.335 --> 01:57:57.603
DANGEROUS JUST TO BE ABLE TO

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:58.404
GET WATER AND FEED THE

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:02.175
LIVESTOCK SO. IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:02.708
ISSUE I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE

SPEAK ON ON ON THE SAME

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.582

THOUGHT YOU- I JUST WANT TO

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:22.295
SPEAK HONEST RETAILERS

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:23.529
REGARDING LIVESTOCK IN

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:26.098
PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE UP

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:27.166
SMALLER FARMS. THIS BECAME A

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.068
BIG ISSUE FOR ONE OF OUR

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:31.671
NEIGHBORS- WHO WHO IS A VERY

01:58:31.737 --> 01:58:34.106
SMALL FARM BUT HAS A WIDE A

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:36.008
WIDE NUMBER OF- A RABBIT. DUCKS

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:38.744
AND CHICKENS- IF FOR HIM AS A

01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:39.712
SMALL PERSON DOESN'T

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:40.847
NECESSARILY HAVE EQUIPMENT TO

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:42.348
MOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF LIVESTOCK

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:44.317
AT ONCE. BEING ABLE TO GET IN

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:46.052
AND OUT OF THE FIRESTONE- BUT

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.487
TRANSFER ALL THE LIVESTOCK OUT

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:49.188
IS NOT NECESSARILY REALISTIC.

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:51.123
HE HAS FONG WAS NOT REALLY WITH

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:51.858
IN HARM'S WAY OF THE FIRE

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:54.126
DIRECTLY IT WAS AWAY FROM IT-

01:58:54.193 --> 01:58:55.027
AND HE FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:56.662
STAY THERE TO KEEP ANIMALS

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:57.230
ALIVE OTHERWISE THERE'S NO

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:58.498
QUESTION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE.

01:58:58.564 --> 01:58:59.131
JUST DIED BECAUSE THE

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:00.566
REGULATIONS ON WAS IN PLACE FOR

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:03.102
OVER TEN DAYS- I THINK THAT WE

01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.703
NEED TO BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:05.137
IN TERMS OF PINPOINTING WHAT

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:07.373
AREAS ARE ALSO TRULY IN DANGER

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.875
VERSES WHICH ARE ARE ARE NOT

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.109
ANARCHIST KIND OF WITHIN THE

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:11.444
GREATER. DON'T MATCH THAT'S

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:12.645
EASY TO MAINTAIN DUE TO

01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:14.814
ROADBLOCKS- BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:16.015
YOU YOU NEED TO CREATE A

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.517
CERTAIN DEGREE OF MISTRUST

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.852
AMONG- FOLKS IN RURAL

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:20.653

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.321
FARMERS IT IS SMALL FARMERS WHO

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:24.223
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO. GET

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:25.324
THEIR ANIMALS IN AND OUT AND

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:30.563
JUST ARE GOING TO STAY PERIOD.

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:31.030
BECAUSE THEY THEY KNOW

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:31.664

PROBLEM. SO I'D LOVE TO. SEE

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.474
SOME KIND OF A WHITE PAPER FROM

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:31.277
FROM THE AG- FOLKS OUT THERE ON

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:33.746
WHAT THIS OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE-

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:36.816
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- CALIFORNIE

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.217
IN THE AG COMMISSIONERS TO ON

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:39.518
SOMETHING WE ALL COULD AGREE

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.620
ON. MAYBE YOU MISTER CHAIR WE

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:43.489
COULD RUN THAT AS A- COMMITTEE.

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.424
BILL OR SOMETHING TO JUST GET

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:46.225
SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT WAY

02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:47.660
EVERYBODY KNOWS. HEY HERE'S THE

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:49.729
PROCESS I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND-

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:51.363
THIS IS THE CLASS AND THESE ARE

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.232
TIMES WHEN TO TAKE IT AND- NOW

02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:55.000
I KNOW SO NEXT SEASON WE'RE-

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:57.503
ALL SET AND READY TO GO AND NOT

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:58.237
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THANK

02:02:58.304 --> 02:03:01.240
YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- MR

02:03:01.307 --> 02:03:07.613

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:10.883
HE THANK YOU MR HANSEN RAISED

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.718
THE ISSUE ABOUT AND NINETY FIVE

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:13.886
MASKS AND YOU KNOW AT THE

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:15.087
BEGINNING F THE YEAR IF I WAS

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.088
TOLD I WAS GONNA BE PUTTING ON

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.656
A FACE MASK AS MUCH AS I'D BE

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:18.691
PUTTING ON SOCKS I'D BE IN

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:21.093
DISBELIEF- THE N. NINETY FIVE

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.730
MASKS ARE TECHNICALLY SPECIFIC

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.899
AND THERE IS A FEAR. THAT YOU

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:27.933
KNOW THEY JUST WON'T BE ENOUGH

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.468
TO GO AROUND AND I DON'T THINK

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:30.603
WE WERE BEING PUSHED TO WEAR

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:33.205
FACE MASKS IN THE BEGINNING- SO

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.674
MUCH AS TO PRESERVE WHAT PP WAS

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:37.276
THERE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS FOR

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:40.646
HOSPITALS AND- AND SO THERE WAS

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:46.018
A CONCERN. THAT THE FIRST-AVAILABILITY ACCESSIBILITY TO

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:48.387
BUY THAT AT THE SCALE THAT

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:50.489
AGRICULTURE NEEDED THAT IT JUST

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:52.591
WASN'T GOING TO BE POSSIBLE-

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.426
AND YET THERE WAS- THERE IS

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:56.095
CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.396
WEREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING THE

02:03:57.463 --> 02:03:58.864
N. NINETY FIVE MASKS THAT WE

02:03:58.931 --> 02:03:59.498
NEED FOR AGRICULTURE THAT THAT

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:01.867
WAS GOING TO BE- REALLY

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.269
DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:04.336
PROTECTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:05.771
TO DO FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORKING

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:09.809
IN AGRICULTURE- HOW REAL- WHERE

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:12.511
THOSE CONCERNS AND HOW WE SEEN

02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:16.448
THEM COME EVEN OUT AS SUPPLY-

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:19.051
YOU KNOW BECAME HEALTHIER- AND

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:22.188
THE- YOU KNOW LOGISTICS OF

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:24.657
GETTING WHAT WE NEEDED- BECAME

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:30.863
MORE CLEAR- JUST LIKE. YOU KNOW

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:32.898
TWELVE PAPERS BACK ON SHELVES-

02:04:32.965 --> 02:04:35.835
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. AND OF

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.536
PANDEMIC IN THIS LET'S DANCE TO

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:38.170
BECAUSE WE KNEW WE COME INTO

02:04:38.237 --> 02:04:39.572
WILDFIRE SEASON ENDED WITH THE

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.106
NEW SMOKE THAT REGULATIONS ARE

02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:43.876
COMES TO OUR OUR WORK FORCE ARE

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:44.777
PLEASE. THE NEED FOR THOSE

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.512
MASS. BUT THE BEGINNING OF THE

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:48.214
PANDEMIC E ARE ASKED TO GIVE

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.281
UP OUR STOCKPILE THE FIRST

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:50.516
RESPONDERS AND IF YOU REMEMBER

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.151
EVEN THE CDC WAS SAYING IF YOU

02:04:52.218 --> 02:04:54.453
ARE NOT A FIRST RESPONDER. AND

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:55.788
DON'T WEAR A MASK THAT WAS

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:58.624
LATER CHANGED- SO WE GAVE OUR

02:04:58.691 --> 02:04:59.592
SUPPLY THAT WE HAD AN

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:00.993
AGRICULTURE ABOUT ONE POINT

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.161
FIVE MILLION MASS TO THE FIRST

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:05.130
RESPONDERS BUT KEPT REMINDING

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.699
EVERYBODY. THAT IS ONLY A

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:07.399
NINETY FIVE MASS THAT IS WHAT

02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:08.467
YOU KNOW THAT CAL OSHA

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:11.937
CERTIFIES- TO- TO GET OUR WORK

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:16.242
FORCE. IN CASE OF- THAT SMOKE

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:18.878
WORK DAYS- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:20.079
CAYENNE NINETY FIVE OUT THERE'S

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:20.980
BEEN A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO

02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:22.815
GET THAT CERTIFIED AS WELL

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:23.249
COULD THAT MEET THE

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:25.117
CERTIFICATION SO. NOR THAT

02:05:25.184 --> 02:05:26.418
PROCESS IS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:27.720
USE THE K. AND NINETY FIVE BUT

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:28.187
THAT IS CERTAINLY AN

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:29.655
ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD BE OUT

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:31.423
THERE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION

02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:33.025
LIKE THIS AND THE OTHER. PART

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:34.727
THAT REALLY WAS HOW EARLY YOU

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.295
KNOW THE FIRE I HAVE BACKED

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:37.463
AWAY FROM ON SEPTEMBER NINTH I

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.665
BELIEVE. THAT EIGHT ACTUALLY

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:41.967
STARTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH OR

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:43.002
AUGUST SIXTEENTH IN PLUMAS

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:45.471
COUNTY. AND HOW LONG THOSE DAYS

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:47.606
WERE AND HOW EARLY IT STARTED-

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:49.708
REALLY PUT US A BEHIND IN TERMS

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.043
OF HAVING THAT THE THOSE FACE

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.178
MASK FOR A WORKERS. COMP BUT WE

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:54.813
ARE WE ARE WE ARE RIGHT WHERE

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:55.748
WE WERE IN MARCH IN TERMS OF

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:59.184
AVAILABILITY. AND THE SHORTAGES

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:00.386
WITH THE MASS. ALL RIGHT AND

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:01.620
YOU YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ASKING

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.055
THE QUESTION EARLIER ON ABOUT

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:04.757
OR RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:07.059
TREES THAT WERE BEING CUT DOWN.

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:09.495
YES YEAH IT SO YOU WOULDN'T

02:06:09.561 --> 02:06:12.331
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- THE

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:13.832
FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION THAT

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.868
UTILITIES ARE DOING THE TREES

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:16.602
ARE YOU'RE TALKING TO OR

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.137
ACTUALLY IN ORCHARD IS OUR

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:19.004
NETWORK THAT ARE ACTIVELY

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:20.306
FARMED THEY HAVE EASEMENTS OF

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:21.874
THE POWER LINES TO THE ORCHARDS

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:23.409
STARPOINT REALLY IS THAT THAT

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:24.510
IS NOT WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:25.444
BE NOT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.812
ORCHARDS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS THE

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:28.514
TIMELINESS OF HAVING TO CUT

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.114
THESE TREES AND MITIGATE OR

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:31.850
THE FIRE RISK- THAT THE

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:32.918
UTILITIES SHOULD REALLY SPEND

02:06:32.985 --> 02:06:34.887
THE TIME. IN THOSE HIGH SEVERE

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:37.289
WILDFIRE AREAS AND NOT IN OUR

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:39.058
ORCHARDS AND LITERALLY FARMERS

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.392
WAKE UP WITH EQUIPMENT IN THE

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:41.360
MIDDLE OF THE ORCHARDS AND THEY

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:42.995
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE THERE- WITH

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:47.299
THEIR TREES GETTING STOPPED AND

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:48.233
WOOD. DO YOU HAVE. WITH THE

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.568
CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RAISING

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:50.903
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:54.606
APPROPRIATE. HAVE YOU MAPPED OR

02:06:54.673 --> 02:06:56.108
OR CONSIDERED WE'RE THE HIGHER

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.877
RISK LINES ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:02.348
P. GENIES OWN INSPECTIONS- ON.

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:04.149
THE THE LINE YOU KNOW THAT

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:06.452
STARTED- THAT THEY CAN'T FIRE

02:07:06.518 --> 02:07:08.253
FOR EXAMPLE I WAS VERY WELL

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.022
KNOWN- THAT THEY NEED TO DO

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:11.590
THAT WORK IN IT THEY DIDN'T DO

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:13.926
THAT WORK. SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:15.761
IN AND BIãU I THINK YOU'D

02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:17.763
MENTIONED YOU SPECIFICALLY ARE

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.898
YOU LOOKING OUTLINES THAT HAVE

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:22.301
PASSED TESTS AND HAVE. GONE

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:23.869
THROUGH MORE RIGOROUS

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:25.404
INSPECTIONS AND HAVE HAD BEEN

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:28.407
UPDATED MORE RECENTLY THAN THE

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:29.274
HUNDRED YEAR OLD LINES THAT

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:32.478
PG&amp;E DID NOT DO THE WORK ON OR

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:33.545
ARE YOU JUST SAYING WE JUST

02:07:33.612 --> 02:07:34.346
DON'T WANT THIS BEING DONE

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:36.782
NEAR- THE FARMED ORCHARDS. WELL

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:38.751
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FOR POWER

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.252
TRANSMISSION ITSELF IT IT YOU

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:41.854
DON'T WE KNOW OUR WHICH HAS TO

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.855
BE LOOKED AT BUT WE NEED TO

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:44.757
PRIORITIZE WHERE WE'RE AT NOT

02:07:44.823 --> 02:07:46.325
JUST MEETING A GOAL OF REMOVING

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:50.562
SO MUCH- SO MUCH FUEL TO MEET

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:55.100
OUR REQUIREMENTS- YOU KNOW FROM

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:55.701
CAL FIRE STATE BILL. BUT THAT

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:57.036
IS THAT IT SHOULD ONLY BE THE

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:58.637
PARTY SHOULD BE WHERE THOSE

02:07:58.704 --> 02:08:00.305
ACTUAL FIRE RISKS ARE AND I

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.440
DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:02.674
MAPS YOU KNOW YOU THAT IF THE

02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:04.343
TERMS WHAT PG&amp;E IS LOOKING AT

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:05.444
WHETHER. HIGH RISK ARE I WILL

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:07.379
TELL YOU THE MAPS ARE OUT THERE

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:09.014
WHERE THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:11.183
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE

02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:12.451
START OF THIS YEAR WAS THAT IF

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:14.553
IDENTIFIED EXTREMELY HIGH RISK

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:15.521
FOR WILDFIRES IS TEN MILLION

02:08:15.587 --> 02:08:17.756
ACRES. SO WE CAN SIT HERE AND

02:08:17.823 --> 02:08:19.224
TALK ABOUT HOW WE BURKE FOUR

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:20.459
MILLION ACRES BUT THERE'S

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:21.660
ANOTHER SIX MILLION STILL OUT

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:22.194
THERE THEY'RE CONSIDERED

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:23.962
EXTREME HIGH RISK BUT WHAT WE

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:25.197
SAW BURNING IN THIS FIRE.

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:26.331
WASN'T JUST THE EXTREME HIGH

02:08:26.398 --> 02:08:29.568
RISK. SO BAG THAT. OUR OUR

02:08:29.635 --> 02:08:30.536
POSITION IS LIKE LET'S

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:32.237
PRIORITIZE WHAT LIMITED FUNDS

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:33.639
WE DO GET EVERY YEAR OR WHAT

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:35.574
TIME WINDOW WE HAVE. LET'S

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:37.142
PRIORITIZE AND MAKE SURE TRULY

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:38.877
IS IN A HIGH RISK FIRE AREA

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:42.114
WHERE WE ARE. DEALING WITH

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.015
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. I THINK

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:46.452
MISTER. THANK YOU. HI

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:48.353
INTEREST TIME SINCE WE'RE

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:49.455
ALMOST OUT OF TIME SEVEN OF THE

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:52.491
PANEL WILL HAVE TO MOVE ON. I

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:54.193
APPRECIATE- THE PANELISTS. THAT

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:55.527

PANEL- THIS THIRD PANEL

02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:58.630
AGRICULTURE BASED WILDFIRE

LIKE A LOT OF BALL GUYS I WEAR

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.050
MANY DIFFERENT HATS AND I'M

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.252
ALSO A SMALL SCALE SHEEP

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:55.420
PRODUCER IN PLASTER COUNTY JUST

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:58.257
UP THE HILL HERE- I SHOULD

02:09:58.323 --> 02:09:59.258
START BY SAYING THAT MY

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:00.826
COMMENTS TODAY ARE BASED ON MY

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:02.694
RESEARCH AND MY- EXPERIENCE AND

02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:04.930
DON'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE

02:10:04.997 --> 02:10:05.564
VIEWPOINT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:10:05.631 --> 02:10:08.066
CALIFORNIA- BUT THAT BEING

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:10.602
SAID. YOU SEE AG AND NATURAL

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:13.305
RESOURCES AND COOPER EXTENSION.

02:10:13.372 --> 02:10:14.439
HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:17.709
THROUGHOUT. THIS CRISIS ON THE

02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:18.210
GROUND AND IN AND LOCAL

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:21.880
COMMUNITIES- I THINK. IT AND

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:23.282
REFLECTING ON WHAT PREVIOUS

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.950
PANELISTS HAVE SAID THAT THAT

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:26.385
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:28.453
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AGRICULTURE IS

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.054
A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:32.057
ISSUE- NOT ONLY ADDRESSING

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:34.059
BEFORE THE FIRE HAPPENS AND

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.194
BEING ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.129
RESPONSE TO WILDFIRE BUT BUT

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.931
THEN IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS AS

02:10:38.997 --> 02:10:41.133
WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.367
JUST ONE AREA WHERE I THINK

02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:44.036
THERE'S SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:46.104
FOR AGRICULTURE TO- TO

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:48.440
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EFFORT.

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:50.609
TARGETED GRAZING- IS THE

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:52.744
APPLICATION OF A SPECIFIC KIND

02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:54.613
AND CLASS OF LIVESTOCK AND A

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:56.915
DETERMINE SEASON. FOR DETERMINE

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:59.017
MOUNT OF TIME. ADDED A SPECIFIC

02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:01.119
INTENSITY. TO ACCOMPLISH

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:02.621
VEGETATION OR LANDSCAPE LEVEL

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:05.490
GOALS. IT REFOCUSES WHAT WE DO

02:11:05.557 --> 02:11:07.459
IS GRAZING FROM THE PRODUCTION

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:09.695
OF FOOD AND FIBER. TO DEALING

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:11.430
WITH VEGETATION ISSUES AND I

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.564
THINK THAT'S A REALY IMPORTANT

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.366
DISTINCTION IT'LL COME BACK TO

02:11:14.433 --> 02:11:17.102
IN A MOMENT. TARGETED GRAZING

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:18.303
CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN A

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.271
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:22.541
ENVIRONMENTS AND IN SITUATIONS-

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:25.811
AS DR DALY SUGGESTED- GRAZING

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:27.279
IN WHILE AND PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:11:27.346 --> 02:11:28.880
REALLY THE ONLY TOOLS IN OUR

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:31.483
TOOLBOX THAT REMOVE FUEL. ON

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:33.285
THE OTHER TOOL STILL THE FUEL

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:34.720
ON THE LANDSCAPE AND GRAZING

02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:37.022
AND PRESCRIBED FIRE ARE UNIQUE

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:39.791
IN THAT IN THAT WAY. TYPICALLY

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:41.326
TARGETED GRAZING CAN BE VERY

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:43.095
COST EFFECTIVE WHERE OTHER

02:11:43.161 --> 02:11:45.163
OPTIONS ARE INEFFECTIVE OR TOO

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:47.866
COSTLY. ON TRAINER TO PARKER

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:49.635
FEET IT'S TOO STEEP A REMOTE OR

02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:51.336
ROCKY TO TREAT WITH WITH

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:52.638
EQUIPMENT OR WITH OTHER

02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:55.407
TECHNIQUES- WE'RE FINDING IT.

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:57.242
ON AND IN A VARIETY OF PLACES

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:58.710
WHERE IT'S HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

02:11:58.777 --> 02:12:00.545
THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

02:12:00.612 --> 02:12:01.913
WHERE MAYBE WE CAN'T DO

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.649
PRESCRIBED FIRE BECAUSE OF THE

02:12:03.715 --> 02:12:04.683
LIABILITY ISSUES WE CAN

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:08.420
CERTAINLY BRING. LIVESTOCK IN

02:12:08.487 --> 02:12:08.987
AN ENTRY DOES FUEL LOADS AS

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.522
WELL. WE'RE ALSO FINDING THAT

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:11.923
IT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:13.458
MAINTAINING WORK THAT WE'VE

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:15.494
DONE TO CREATE FUEL BREAKS-

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.829
MORE WE'VE GONE IN AND DONE THE

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:18.430
INITIAL WORK PERHAPS

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:20.232
MECHANICALLY. BUT THEN WE CAN

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:21.800
USE LIVESTOCK TO MAINTAIN NOT

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:24.569
WORKING AND MAINTAIN THE FIRE

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:26.638
SAFETY OF THOSE LANDSCAPES. I

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:28.073
THINK THE KEY DISTINCTION HERE

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.574
IS THAT IT'S A SERVICE RATHER

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:31.777
THAN A PRODUCTION MODEL. AND AS

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:33.845
A SERVICE TAKES- HIGHLY

02:12:33.912 --> 02:12:36.181
COMPETENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.316
HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR TO

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:39.651
ACCOMPLISH WELL AND I THINK

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:41.687
THAT'S A REALLY KEY POINTS.

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:43.322
TARGETED GRAZING IS DIFFERENT

02:12:43.388 --> 02:12:44.656
THAN A CONVENTIONAL

02:12:44.723 --> 02:12:46.525
CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION MODEL.

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:48.860
IN THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE

02:12:48.927 --> 02:12:51.730
VEGETATION. MY SHE BUSINESS I'M

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:53.332
FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE MY

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.867
SHEEP HAVE PROPER NUTRITION ALL

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:57.402
YEAR ROUND SO I GET AS MANY

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.071
LAMBS ON THE GROUND AS I CAN

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:00.205
WITH THE TARGETED GRAZING

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:01.740
BUSINESS WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:03.542
MANAGING THAT BETTER TATIAN AND

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.277
SO TYPICALLY WE HAVE LOWER

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:06.778
REPRODUCTION RATES WE DON'T

02:13:06.845 --> 02:13:08.013
HAVE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:08.914
TO SELL IN A CONVENTIONAL

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.582
MODEL. AND I THINK THAT'S AN

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:11.850
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO THINK

02:13:11.917 --> 02:13:15.253
ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW HOWTHIS-

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.657
PARTICULAR AFRICAN WORK.

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.225
GRAZING IS YOU CURRENTLY BEING

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:23.061
USED- AND DR DALY MENTIONED US

02:13:23.128 --> 02:13:24.463
AS WELL YOU KNOW IT'S AN

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:25.964
ACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN HISTORIC

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:27.966
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:29.368
WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:30.769
TARGETED GRAZING AS A

02:13:30.836 --> 02:13:32.337
PARTICULAR APPROACH TO THIS

02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:35.741
ISSUE. IN THE LAST. FIVE YEARS.

02:13:35.807 --> 02:13:37.709
WE'VE DOCUMENTED AT LEAST

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:38.377
THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:39.745
CALIFORNIA WERE GRAZING IS

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:42.147
BEING USED AS A FUEL FOR

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:44.649
REDUCTION TECHNIQUE- COUNTIES

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:47.119
LIKE SAN FRANCISCO- MARIN

02:13:47.185 --> 02:13:49.688
COUNTY- NO SANDRA ELLER IS

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:51.923
USING GOATS I KNOW- WE'RE

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:53.158
SEEING IT BEING USED IN LOS

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:54.993
ANGELES AND TORRANCE AND DIEGO

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.695
COUNTIES. AND SO THERE'S THIS

02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.497
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT IN

02:13:58.563 --> 02:13:59.898
AREAS WHERE PERHAPS THERE HAVE

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:03.435
NOT BEEN- LIVESTOCK. PRODUCTION

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:06.471
FOR SOME TIME IN A ROLE

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:07.305
TARGETED MANNER. WE'RE ALSO

02:14:07.372 --> 02:14:08.874
HEARING FROM FIRE AGENCIES THAT

02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:11.810
IT WORKS- YOU KNOW CAL FIRE-

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.378
THROUGH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:15.447
OVERSEAS CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:16.915
A- PRESCRIBED YOUR BILL EVERY

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:18.483
WHITE PAPER THAT REALLY LAYS

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:20.652
OUT HOW THIS CAN WORK IN TERMS

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:22.721
OF FUEL REDUCTION. BUT MAYBE

02:14:22.788 --> 02:14:23.722
MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.090
EVIDENCE ON THE GROUND HERE IN

02:14:25.157 --> 02:14:27.459
THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- THE

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:28.460
HOPLAND RESEARCH EXTENSION

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:30.429
CENTER. WHICH UNIVERSITY HOUSE

02:14:30.495 --> 02:14:32.831
UP NEAR YOU PRIOR. BECAUSE OF A

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:35.066
REALLY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE OF THE

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.601
CHANGE IN FIRE INTENSITY BASED

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:38.837
ON GRAZING VERSES ON NORTH NON.

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:41.339
NONPARTISAN LANDSCAPES- I'VE

02:14:41.406 --> 02:14:43.608
TALKED WITH- THE PRODUCER THAT

02:14:43.675 --> 02:14:45.110
WORKED IN MARIN COUNTY THIS

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:48.313
LAST YEAR THAT HEARD FROM.

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.148
FOLKS- WE'RE A FIRE STARTED AND

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:51.316
DIDN'T SPREAD INTO THE WILD

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:52.317
LAND BECAUSE OF THE GRAZING

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:54.119
THAT IT HAPPENED THERE. SO I

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:56.054
THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE PROOF

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:56.655
THAT THIS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE

02:14:56.721 --> 02:15:00.392
TOOL- I THINK THERE ARE A

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:01.927
COUPLE OF THINGS REALLY FROM

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:04.162
LOOKING AT IT FROM KIND OF A- A

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:06.031
RESEARCH FROM AN ECONOMIC

02:15:06.097 --> 02:15:07.999
DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT. WHERE

02:15:08.066 --> 02:15:09.768
THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:12.003
FOR THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE MORE

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:14.539
OF THIS KIND OF WORK. CERTAINLY

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.875
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE DOING IT-

02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:18.043
AND SO THE KIND OF CAPITAL

02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:19.544
INVESTMENT IN THE TRAINING AND

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.346
EDUCATION NECESSARY TO GET

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:23.448
PEOPLE UP TO SPEED ON THIS-

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.816
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS A

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.084
GREAT RESOURCE FOR SOME OF THAT

02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:28.453
TRAINING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.221
ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CAPITAL

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:31.556
INVESTMENTS. IN EQUIPMENT AND

02:15:31.623 --> 02:15:33.658
LIVESTOCK IN AND KNOW HOW TO

02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:36.161
MAKE THIS WORK. THERE ARE A

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.963
NUMBER OF FUEL REDUCTION COST

02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:39.731
SHARE PROGRAMS ARE CHIEF

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:41.466
SCHUMER TALKED ABOUT SENATE

02:15:41.533 --> 02:15:42.868
BILL NINE OH ONE WHICH PROVIDES

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.970
SOME MONEY- FOR FUELS REDUCTION

02:15:45.036 --> 02:15:46.938
OVER THE NEXT. MAKERS FOR YEARS

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:48.573
LEFT IN THAT PROGRAM NOW IF I

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:51.643
RECALL CORRECTLY- THAT PROGRAM

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:53.144
COULD COULD REALLY FOCUS SOME

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:55.046
EFFORT ON CARSHARE FOR DOING

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:57.115
THIS KIND OF WORK- IT HAS

02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:58.817
FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:15:58.884 --> 02:16:00.485
FUELS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES BUT-

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:02.320
BUT TARGETED GRAZING. CAN AND

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:05.223
SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT- USDA

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:06.691
HAS THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

02:16:06.758 --> 02:16:08.260
INCENTIVES PROGRAM THAT PAYS

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:10.328
CARSHARE FOR LANDOWNERS. AND

02:16:10.395 --> 02:16:11.730
THEY ARE NOW IN CALIFORNIA

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:13.765
DOING CAR SHARE ON TARGETED

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:16.668
GRAZING WHICH I THINK IS

02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:17.702
INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING. AND

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:18.937
THEN I THINK THE LAST ISSUE

02:16:19.004 --> 02:16:21.273
GETS TO THIS IDEA OF THE

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:22.941
KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:25.410
TO MAKE THIS WORK- MANY OF THE

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:27.879
CONTRACTS PARTICULARLY. IN MORE

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:30.615
THE URBAN AREAS DO REQUIRE

02:16:30.682 --> 02:16:31.650
SOMEBODY ON SITE TWENTY FOUR

02:16:31.716 --> 02:16:35.554
SEVEN. AND THROUGH- THE

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:38.890
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF AB

02:16:38.957 --> 02:16:40.325
TEN SIXTY SIX WHICH WHICH DEALS

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:42.627
WITH ACT OVERTIME ISSUES- THERE

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:44.462
ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:46.364
WITH RESPECT TO SHEEPHERDERS.

02:16:46.431 --> 02:16:47.666
THERE'S AN EASY FIX TO THAT IN

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.868
TERMS OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:51.670
THAT WERE ADOPTED DURING THE

02:16:51.736 --> 02:16:53.505
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT

02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:55.473
DEAL WITH HURTING REGULATIONS

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.275
AND I THINK THAT'S A- THE PLACE

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.210
PERHAPS TO LOOK AT NOT BRINGING

02:16:59.277 --> 02:17:00.679
FOR STATE PROGRAM IN LINE WITH

02:17:00.745 --> 02:17:02.447
FEDERAL PROGRAMS AS WELL.

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:05.250
WITHOUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:05.817
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THANK

OUTLINES THE PREMEDITATION ALL

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:39.150
RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON. THREE N.

02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:41.920
AS THE ANCHOR I'M HAPPY TO SWIM

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:44.389
FASTER TODAY- SO THANK YOU

FARMLAND TRUST I'M HAPPY TO SEE

02:17:53.865 --> 02:17:55.000
THIS BIG CONTINGENCY FROM

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:56.868
CINEMA AND NAPA AND THE CINEMA

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:59.204
COUNTY RESIDENT AND A NAPA

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:01.840
VALLEY NATIVE. SO I HAVE A

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:04.275
EVACUATED THE LAST FIVE YEARS

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:04.743
HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.578
AGRICULTURE WHO LOST THEIR

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:08.279
VINEYARDS AND THEIR BRANCHES

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:09.547
AND FRIENDS WHO LOST THEIR

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:11.883
HOMES. SO THIS IS CLOSE TO HOME

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:14.786
FOR ME- AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.888
IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT. WE

02:18:16.955 --> 02:18:18.223
LIKE TO SAY WE WORK FROM

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.291
KITCHEN TABLE TO CONGRESS ON

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:22.127
PROTECTING FARMLANDS

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:23.495
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND FARMING

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:26.231
PRACTICES. AND SUPPORTING A NEW

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:28.733
GENERATION OF FARMERS. BUT FOR

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.102
TODAY FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:32.404
I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIEF

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:33.972
BACKGROUND ON THE BENEFITS OF

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:35.707
PROTECTING OUR CALIFORNIA FARMS

02:18:35.774 --> 02:18:37.976
AND RANCHES AS A WILDFIRE

02:18:38.043 --> 02:18:41.780
MITIGATION STRATEGY. AM I THE

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:49.387
ONE FORTY NEEDS. ABOUT THE

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:50.555
MULTIPLE BENEFITS OUR

02:18:50.622 --> 02:18:52.424
AGRICULTURAL LAND PROVIDES IS

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:54.726
OFTEN OVERLOOKED ACCORDING TO

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:56.261
RESEARCH ON GREENHOUSE GAS

02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:57.796
MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES IN

02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:59.664
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:01.199
PROTECTING FARM AND RANCH LAND

02:19:01.266 --> 02:19:02.567
IS LIKELY TO HAVE THE SINGLE

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.969
GREATEST IMPACT IN STABILIZING

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:07.405
AND REDUCING FUTURE EMISSIONS

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:09.941
ACROSS MULTIPLE LAND USES. I

02:19:10.008 --> 02:19:11.743
OFTEN THINK IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:13.244
WE ARE BLESSED WITH SUCH

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:15.513
ABUNDANT AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT

02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:17.482
WE FREQUENTLY TAKE FOR GRANTED

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:18.917
ALL THE BENEFITS THAT LAND

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:21.252
PROVIDES AND INCLUDING BEING A

02:19:21.319 --> 02:19:22.887
CRITICAL TOOL IN COMBATING

02:19:22.954 --> 02:19:25.256
CLIMATE CHANGE. NOT ONLY AS A

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:27.425
CARBON SINK BUT HOW IT CAN

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:29.094
MITIGATE FOR DISASTERS SUCH AS

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:31.362
WILDFIRES AMONG A HOST OF OTHER

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:33.465
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL AND

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:44.008
SOCIAL BENEFITS. OKAY TWO

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:45.243
SEPARATE SETS OF RESEARCH

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:46.578
DEMONSTRATED THE CLEAR CLIMATE

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:47.946
BENEFITS THE PROTECTING

02:19:48.012 --> 02:19:49.981
AGRICULTURAL LANDS HAS IN

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:50.482
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

02:19:50.548 --> 02:19:53.218
EMISSIONS. THIS IS A INCLUDES

02:19:53.284 --> 02:19:54.719
RESEARCH FROM ALWAYS JACKSON AT

02:19:54.786 --> 02:19:56.387
UC DAVIS AND AMERICAN FARMLAND

02:19:56.454 --> 02:20:00.358
TRUST. AFT RESEARCH FOUND THAT

02:20:00.425 --> 02:20:01.559
AVERAGE EMISSIONS FROM URBAN

02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.962
AREAS ARE FIFTY EIGHT TO

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:05.764
SEVENTY TIMES HIGHER PER ACRE

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:07.098
THAN THOSE FROM CROP PRODUCTION

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.400
IN CALIFORNIA. RELATED TO THIS

02:20:09.467 --> 02:20:10.668
LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT

02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:12.504
PRODUCES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:14.806
PER CAPITA THAN EFFICIENT HIGH

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:16.708
DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. URBAN

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:18.276
EXPANSION ESPECIALLY LOW

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:20.345
DENSITY DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN

02:20:20.411 --> 02:20:22.447
THE IRREPLACEABLE LOSS OF FAR

02:20:22.514 --> 02:20:24.916
MORE FARMLAND THE NECESSARY.

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:26.518
OUR RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:29.954
CUTTING FARMLAND LOST BY 75% BY

02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:30.855
TWENTY FIFTY WOULD REDUCE OUR

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:32.657
GHG EMISSIONS EQUIVALENT OF

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.492
TAKING ONE POINT NINE MILLION

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:36.761
CARS OFF THE ROAD EACH YEAR.

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.062
PROTECTING FARMLAND WHILE

02:20:38.129 --> 02:20:39.430
GROWING CITIES IN A COMPACT

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:41.099
MATTER WOULD HAVE THIRTY THREE

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:42.367
TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:44.335
REDUCTIONS PER ACRE PER YEAR

02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:44.836
WHEN COMPARED TO SPRAWL

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:47.172
DEVELOPMENT. THIS TYPE OF

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:47.972
EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT

02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:49.808
STABILIZES AND REDUCES FUTURE

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:51.576
EMISSIONS WHILE STILL ALLOWING

02:20:51.643 --> 02:20:53.645
THE STATE ECONOMY TO EXPAND.

02:20:53.711 --> 02:20:54.712
AND HOUSING GOALS TO BE

02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:57.482
ACHIEVED. IT'S NOT WHETHER WE

02:20:57.549 --> 02:21:00.451
NEED TO GROW ITS HOW WE GROW.

02:21:00.518 --> 02:21:01.619
THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:03.054
CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA'S GOAL

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.722
OF REDUCING STATEWIDE GHG

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:07.058
EMISSIONS BY 80% BY TWENTY

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:08.860
FIFTY. SAYS MANY FOLKS HAVE

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:11.196
SAID BEFORE AGAS TRULY PART OF

02:21:11.262 --> 02:21:12.897
THE SOLUTION AND COMBATING

02:21:12.964 --> 02:21:19.070
CLIMATE CHANGE. IN ADDITION AND

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:20.471
YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE FROM

02:21:20.538 --> 02:21:22.140
THE FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKERS.

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:23.741
AGRICULTURAL LAND TO

02:21:23.808 --> 02:21:25.143
SUSTAINABLY MANAGE FARM AND

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.744
RANCH LAND PROVIDES A HOST OF

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:28.913
ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS. BUT THEY

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.448
ALSO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:32.350
HELP WITH WILDFIRE PREVENTION

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.585
SOMETIMES WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:35.520
THAT AS DIRECTLY AS IT ACTUALLY

02:21:35.587 --> 02:21:38.122
IS. IRRIGATED CROPLAND JUST

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:39.290
LIKE IN THE CASE OF CINEMA

02:21:39.357 --> 02:21:40.959
COUNTY CAN BE UTILIZED AS A

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:43.494
FIRE BREAK. INCREASED WATER

02:21:43.561 --> 02:21:45.797
SUPPLIES FROM GROUNDWATER

02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:47.932
RECHARGE ZONES CAN INCREASE

02:21:47.999 --> 02:21:51.903
FIRE FOR FIRE PREVENTION. AND

02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:54.005
CLEARLY WHEN WE USE MORE

02:21:54.072 --> 02:21:55.073
REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL

02:21:55.139 --> 02:21:57.542
PRACTICES. I AM IT'S SMART

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:59.444
AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES HEALTHY

02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:02.847
SOILS PRACTICES. WE ARE ABLE TO

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.249
MULTIPLY THAT BENEFITS MANY

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:07.085
TIMES OVER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT

02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:11.155
THAT WE DO BOTH. NOT ALL

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:12.757
REMAINING FARMLAND IS IDEAL FOR

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:14.993
AGRICULTURE HOWEVER SOMETIMES

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:16.561
CONSIDERED A CONTROVERSIAL

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:18.296
STATEMENT TO SAY THAT BUT

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:20.231
STRESS ON WATER SUPPLIES

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:21.199
UNSUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:23.034
PRACTICES AND UNFORESEEN

02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:24.435
TEMPERATURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE

02:22:24.502 --> 02:22:26.404
DEPLETE THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:27.071
HIGH QUALITY FARMLAND IN

02:22:27.138 --> 02:22:28.806
CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE

02:22:28.873 --> 02:22:30.141
PROTECTING THE BEST FARMLAND

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:32.143
THAT'S LEFT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:33.678
VERSATILE AND RESILIENT IS

02:22:33.745 --> 02:22:37.682
PARAMOUNT. AND THAT BRINGS ME

02:22:37.749 --> 02:22:40.285
TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. OVER THE

02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:42.186
PAST THREE DECADES MORE THAN

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:43.721
ONE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:44.889
FARMLAND HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:47.692
AGRICULTURE. REPRESENTING A

02:22:47.759 --> 02:22:49.260
DEVASTATING LOSS AND

02:22:49.327 --> 02:22:51.629
AGRICULTURAL CAPACITY. EACH

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:52.931
YEAR CALIFORNIA LOSES THE

02:22:52.997 --> 02:22:54.832
AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES

02:22:54.899 --> 02:22:56.501
OF AGRICULTURAL LAND THE

02:22:56.567 --> 02:22:58.670
EQUIVALENT OF MORE THAN ONE AND

02:22:58.736 --> 02:22:59.237
A HALF TIMES THE AREA OF SAN

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:02.640
FRANCISCO. HALF OF THIS LOSS IS

02:23:02.707 --> 02:23:04.008
TAKING PLACE ON THE STATE'S

02:23:04.075 --> 02:23:05.743
MOST PRODUCTIVE FARMLAND WHICH

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.078
IS OFTEN LOCATED AT THE URBAN

02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:09.647
EDGE WHERE IT'S MOST VULNERABLE

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:11.683
TO THE EFFECTS. OF URBAN SPRAWL.

02:23:11.749 --> 02:23:12.984
IF THAT CURRENT DEVELOPMENT

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.519
TREND CONTINUES ANOTHER ONE

02:23:14.585 --> 02:23:16.354
POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES WILL

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:22.060
BE LOST BY MID CENTURY. USING A

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.795
FARMLAND CONSERVATION SCENARIO

02:23:23.861 --> 02:23:25.930
WHICH IS IN GREEN. WHICH IS

02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:27.465
THAT THIS IS THE MODEL FROM

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:30.935
AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. IF WE

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:32.370
SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR STATE

02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:33.972

POLICIES. THAT'S WHERE WE CAN

02:23:45.850 --> 02:23:50.254
STEM THE LOSS OF FARMLAND. WE

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:52.323
KNOW FROM RECENT RESEARCH BY

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:54.192
CALIFORNIA RANGELANDS TRUSTS.

02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:55.693
THAT THEIR APPROVING ECONOMIC

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.662
BENEFITS THAT. THAT THE

02:23:57.729 --> 02:23:59.931
ECOSYSTEMS SERVICE SERVICES

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:02.033
PROVIDE ONE PROTECTED. THE

02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:03.701
RECENT STUDY SAID JUST A LITTLE

02:24:03.768 --> 02:24:05.803
OVER OVER THREE HUNDRED

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:06.404
THOUSAND ACRES THAT THEY HAVE

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:08.473
EASEMENT ON PROVIDES ONE

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:10.241
BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.777
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ANNUALLY.

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:14.112
MORE SPECIFICALLY AG LAND

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.513
PROTECTION IS KEY TO HELPING US

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.715
MITIGATE FOR INCREASED NATURAL

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:19.650
DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES.

02:24:19.717 --> 02:24:20.952
BUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:23.121
THAT MEDICATION IS A LITTLE

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:25.456
KNOWN OR QUANTIFIED. AND THAT

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:26.324
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.992
WE REALLY COULD WORK WITH ALL

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.994

THE BENEFITS THAT ALL THESE

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.297
THINGS ARE PROVIDING. IT IS NO

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:34.732
DOUBT EXPONENTIALLY GREATER

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:39.203
IMPACT. SO IN CLOSING. I GREW

02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:40.838
CULTURAL LAND PROTECTION CAN

02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:42.540

FUNDING PROGRAMS TO PROTECT OUR

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:53.384

THIS KIND OF WORK IN CANADA THE

02:25:51.509 --> 02:25:53.144
NUMBER OF ACRES GRAZED I THINK

02:25:53.211 --> 02:25:53.978

DOING THAT WORK REALLY VERY BY

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:11.529
THE TYPE OF TERRAIN AND BY ON

02:26:11.596 --> 02:26:13.297
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OF THE

02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:15.733
PROJECT INVOLVED. WE'RE SEEING

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.503
THOSE RATES RANGE FROM AROUND

02:26:18.569 --> 02:26:19.370
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS

TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT

02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:32.683
NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THAT THAT

02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:34.652
ALSO DID VERY IS DEPENDS RIGHT

02:26:34.719 --> 02:26:36.120
DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF RISK

02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:39.223
AND- COMPLEXITY WITH SOME OF

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:42.293
THE MORE URBAN SITES THAT FOLKS

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.962

ERRORS ARE A REALLY REMOTE AND

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.935
HARD TO GET TO SO IT ARE NOT

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.603

AROUND LIVESTOCK KNOWS THAT-

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:35.446
THAT THEY DON'T PUNCH A CLOCK

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:36.948
EITHER AND SO THE WORK. THE

02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:39.183
WORK NEEDS TO HAPPEN- WHEN IT'S

02:27:39.250 --> 02:27:41.586
IN FRONT OF US WITH RESPECT TO

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:44.021
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- THERE

02:27:44.088 --> 02:27:47.091
HAS BEEN- A FEDERAL PROGRAM

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:49.894
THAT PROVIDES FOR. SHEEPHERDERS

02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:51.596
AND GROCERS IN PARTICULAR WHO

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:52.730
ARE WORKING IN THESE TYPES OF

02:27:52.797 --> 02:27:56.100
SITUATIONS- WHILE THEY ARE.

02:27:56.167 --> 02:27:58.769
LIVING AND WORKING. WITH THAT

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:00.838
WITH THAT PARTICULAR OPERATION.

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:03.541
THE FEDERAL PROGRAM RECOGNIZES

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.176
THAT THEY WORK A FORTY EIGHT

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:07.945
HOUR WORK WEEK- CALIFORNIA HAS

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:08.846
TAKEN A DIFFERENT

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:10.381
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THAT

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:12.116
WORK WEEK ENTAILS AND THAT'S

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:12.850
WHERE THE UNINTENDED

02:28:12.917 --> 02:28:16.387
CONSEQUENCES. OF THE OF AB TEN

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:18.522
SIXTY SIX COME INTO PLAY- UNDER

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:21.492
CALIFORNIA DEFINITION- IT'S A

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:22.393
HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT HOUR

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.563
WORK WEEK. AND SO ONCE THAT

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:26.764
THAT LEGISLATION IS FULLY

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:29.567
IMPLEMENTED- THE INITIAL YEAR

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:31.669
OF THAT WOULD INCREASE COSTS BY

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:36.774
OVER 60% AND. AND GO UP FROM

02:28:36.841 --> 02:28:38.843
THERE- WITH IN THE- PROGRAM IT

02:28:38.909 --> 02:28:40.878
IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE ACTUAL

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:43.314
WORK THAT IS BEING DONE ON THE

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:44.849
LANDSCAPE AND SO THAT

02:28:44.915 --> 02:28:47.184
PARTICULAR. DEFINITION IN TERMS

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:49.920
OF FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS ALSO

02:28:49.987 --> 02:28:51.222
MORE IN LINE WITH WARY BE

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:54.392
TURNED SIXTY SIX- WOULD BE

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:56.594
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS WELL.

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:57.828
SO WOULD WOULD YOU SEE THAT AS

02:28:57.895 --> 02:28:59.230
SOMETHING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:01.899
ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:04.502
ADJUST TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT.

02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:07.738
YOU KNOW FOR THE INSTANCES OF.

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.340
THESE TYPES ARE HEARD IN THIS

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:12.043
TYPE OF WORK FORCE. TO FOLLOW

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:14.879
THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES VERSUS

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:16.714
THE STATE GUIDELINES I MEAN HOW

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:18.749
HOW. HOW WOULD WE NEED TO GO

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:21.485
ABOUT FIXING THAT TO ENSURE

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:22.086
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:25.923
USE- IN IN CONTINUE USE OF THIS

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:28.392
TYPE OF FIRE MITIGATION SO THAT

02:29:28.459 --> 02:29:30.628
WAY THIS DOESN'T. END UP

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:31.195
LEAVING THE STATE LIKE OTHER

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:33.764
THINGS. SO THE- INITIAL

02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:35.599
CALIFORNIA INTERPRETATION WAS

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:38.035
MADE ADMINISTRATIVELY AND SO IT

02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:41.138
IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THIS

02:29:41.205 --> 02:29:42.073
THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE

02:29:42.139 --> 02:29:43.174
DETERMINATION TO BRING

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:45.343
CALIFORNIA'S POLICY IN LINE

02:29:45.409 --> 02:29:45.843
WITH THE FEDERAL

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:48.379
INTERPRETATION. WHAT COULD BE

02:29:48.446 --> 02:29:49.814
DONE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY IT

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.115
WOULD NOT NOT THEIRS AS I

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:53.384
UNDERSTAND IT REQUIRE

02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:56.687
LEGISLATION TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.

02:29:56.754 --> 02:30:00.124
THANK YOU THANK YOU. LEVINE

02:30:00.191 --> 02:30:05.229
QUESTION. YEAH YOU MIGHT WANNA

02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:22.012
TAKE A SEAT. THANK YOU. BUT

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:24.882
IT'S NOT YOU KNOW. EVEN ON ZOOM

02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:26.016
I STILL HAVE IT ON IT ALL THE

02:30:26.083 --> 02:30:27.985
TIME SO YOU'D MENTION THE USE

02:30:28.052 --> 02:30:30.488
OF THE SHEEP AND REALLY WE'VE

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:33.491
SEEN IT IN- KIND OF THE MORE

02:30:33.557 --> 02:30:35.926
DEVELOPED AREAS WHICH WHEN I

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:37.294
TALK TO IT'S A FIREFIGHTING

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:38.829
PROFESSIONALS AND THAT'S REALLY

02:30:38.896 --> 02:30:40.731
THE RISK IS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:41.999
THESE MASSIVE EVENTS THAT DO

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:43.634
OCCUR AND HAVE REALLY HURT THE

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:45.136
NORTH BAY AND OTHER PARTS OF

02:30:45.202 --> 02:30:46.737
CALIFORNIA BUT THE RISK IS

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:49.373
THESE. DEVELOPED AREAS HOUSE TO

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:51.542
HOUSE MEMBERS WHICH WE'VE SEEN

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:53.077
IN THE BIG BIG EVENTS BUT BUT

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:53.911
CERTAINLY HAPPENS ON EVERYDAY

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:56.947
BASIS AND- AND THAT THE THAT

02:30:57.014 --> 02:30:58.783
THE SHEEP IN THE WORK THAT THEY

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:00.985
DO PROTECT AGAINST- THAT

02:31:01.051 --> 02:31:02.753
SPREADING MORE MASSIVELY IS

02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:04.655
WE'VE WE'VE SEEN AND I THINK

02:31:04.722 --> 02:31:06.524
THERE TO REALLY GREAT EXTENT IN

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:08.626
A BIG FIRE SITUATION IT WAS

02:31:08.692 --> 02:31:11.028
ILLUSTRATED- IN CINEMA CLOSE TO

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:13.531
SAN PABLO BAY NEAR THIS THE

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:16.534
CINEMA RACEWAY- WHERE- WHAT

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:17.268
COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:18.736
DEVASTATING EVENT AND CERTAINLY

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:20.771
WAS THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE

02:31:20.838 --> 02:31:23.474
NORTH BAY THAT NIGHT'S- WAS

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:25.142
ABLE TO YOU KNOW FIGHT BACK

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:27.111
THAT FIRE. PROBABLY BECAUSE OF

02:31:27.178 --> 02:31:30.147
THE WORK THAT SHE HAD DONE OVER

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:31.315
MANY YEARS. AND IT WAS A IT WAS

02:31:31.382 --> 02:31:32.950
A REALLY POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION

02:31:33.017 --> 02:31:35.653
OF THE POWER. OF THAT OF USING

02:31:35.719 --> 02:31:38.022
SHEEP IN THIS WAY. HAVE YOU

02:31:38.088 --> 02:31:41.358
SEEN UN GROWTH OR EVEN OVER

02:31:41.425 --> 02:31:43.260
SUBSCRIPTION AND WHAT IS THE

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:45.596
CHALLENGE TO SCALE IF THERE IS

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:48.098
DEMAND FOR THAT- IN THE STATE

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:51.168
IS BIGGEST CALIFORNIA. WE ARE

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:52.536
SEEING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:55.573
GROWTH- IN THAT BOTH IN TERMS

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:57.641
OF EXISTING OPERATIONS THAT ARE

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:58.676
ARE KIND OF EXPANDING WHAT THEY

02:31:58.742 --> 02:32:00.945
DO IN THAT REGARD IN AND

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:02.580
FRANKLY NEW OPERATIONS GETTING

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:04.682
INTO THE BUSINESS. I THINK ONE

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:06.450
OF THE CHALLENGES ARM AS WE

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:08.319
GROW THAT SEGMENT OF THE OF THE

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:10.955
GRAZING BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:12.189
THE KIND OF SKILLS AND

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:13.991
EXPERIENCE IN AND KNOWLEDGE

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:16.227
NECESSARY TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:18.796
AND SAFELY- PARTICULARLY IN A

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:21.098
MORE URBAN LANDSCAPE- IT'S ONE

02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:22.833
THING TO BE TO BE GRAZING SHEEP

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:24.301
OR I DO WHERE THERE'S NOBODY

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:26.604
AROUND. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO

02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:29.106
BE MANAGING LIVESTOCK IN AN

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:31.208
AREA WHERE THERE'S- THOUSANDS

02:32:31.275 --> 02:32:32.543
ARE IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:34.879
PEOPLE AND ALL THE POTENTIAL

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:35.446
FOR CONFLICT THAT GOES WITH

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:39.617
THAT. I THINK- I THINK THE

02:32:39.683 --> 02:32:41.252
OTHER OPPORTUNITY IN THAT

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:42.853
REGARD THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:44.755
TO FOCUS ON IS WE'VE GOT THIS

02:32:44.822 --> 02:32:46.357
WINDOW WHERE WE NEED TO TREAT

02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:49.593
FUELS- YOU KNOW FROM STARTING

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:51.295
IN THE SOUTH MAYBE IN FEBRUARY

02:32:51.362 --> 02:32:53.264
ON UP INTO JUNE AND JULY AND

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:54.198
AUGUST UP UP IN THIS PART OF

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:56.233
THE STATE- BUT THAT STILL

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:58.168
LEAVES SEVERAL MONTHS WHERE

02:32:58.235 --> 02:32:59.803
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FEED

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.805
THOSE LIVESTOCK OTHER PLACES.

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:03.274
AND SO BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:04.875
THAT WERE WE'VE GOT WINTER

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:07.378
GRAZING- TO MAINTAIN THOSE

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.546
KINDS OF FLOCKS AND HERDS I

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:10.347
THINK IS A ANOTHER CHALLENGE

02:33:10.414 --> 02:33:12.016
FOR US IN AND IS FAR AS

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.317
MANAGING AND HOUSING THERE

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.686
HEARD ARE THEY IN RESIDENTS FOR

02:33:15.753 --> 02:33:16.787
A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:17.922
GET ON THAT TRAILER GO TO THE

02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:19.223
NEXT JOB OR THEY GO BACK OUT TO

02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:21.158
TAMALA SPARE OF THE PLASTER AND

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:22.293
GO BACK TO WHERE THEY WOULD

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:23.627
LIVE IN IN THEIR OFF SEASON IF

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:24.795
YOU WILL OR IS THERE A CONSTANT

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:26.397
STREAM OF WORK BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:27.731
GOT IT ALL THE TIME ANYHOW.

02:33:27.798 --> 02:33:29.934
THEY ABSOLUTELY THEY DON'T YOU

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.302
DON'T SHUT THEM OFF AND PUT HIM

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:32.603
IN THE SHED WHEN THEY'RE DONE

02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:35.472
WORK AND- I THINK WHAT WE WHAT

02:33:35.539 --> 02:33:37.274
WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THAT WERE

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:39.610
KIND OF REBUILDING THE OLD-

02:33:39.677 --> 02:33:41.111
PNEUMATIC SYSTEM OF LIVESTOCK

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.880
GRAZING IN THAT THESE FLOCKS

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.882
AND HERDS ARE TYPICALLY ON

02:33:44.949 --> 02:33:46.450
TARGETED GRAZING PROJECTS FROM

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:48.719
FEBRUARY THROUGH MAYBE

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:51.488
SEPTEMBER- AND THEN TYPICALLY

02:33:51.555 --> 02:33:52.856
THEY'LL GO TO A HOME RANCHER

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:56.160
HOME BASE- KIND OF. GET YOU

02:33:56.226 --> 02:33:57.728
KNOW DO ALL THAT THE HEALTH

02:33:57.795 --> 02:33:58.596
WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO WITH

02:33:58.662 --> 02:34:01.165
THEIR ANIMALS- RECUPERATE FROM

02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:02.700
BEING ON THE ROAD BUT THEY'RE

02:34:02.766 --> 02:34:04.401
GOING FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT

02:34:04.468 --> 02:34:06.370
THERE ARE HARD SHEEP AND GOATS

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:08.439
THAT'LL BE IN PLASTER COUNTY IN

02:34:08.505 --> 02:34:10.441
FEBRUARY AND MARCH THAT WILL

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:11.742
THEN COME DOWN TO YOUR PART OF

02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:14.078
THE WORLD- LATER IN THE YEAR

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:15.846
AND KIND OF JUST CONTINUING

02:34:15.913 --> 02:34:17.815
MAKE THAT CIRCUIT. GRATEFUL

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:22.853
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:26.090
QUESTION FROM A SOCCER. RIGHT

02:34:26.156 --> 02:34:28.726
FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM.

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:29.526
THANK YOU IT'S REALLY NICE TO

02:34:29.593 --> 02:34:32.396
SEE YOU I'M NOT MY QUESTION WAS

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:34.431
THE TREND LINES ON

02:34:34.498 --> 02:34:37.501
CONSERVATION- AND CONVERSION

02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:41.005
AND- IN AND LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:41.739
POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.507
CONSEQUENCES FOR AN IMPORTANT

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:45.242
PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:48.846
AND EVEN. FIRE BREAKS AND FIRE

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:51.682
PREVENTION- AND EVEN AYE I

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.450
WOULD TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL

02:34:53.517 --> 02:34:55.085
OUR OPPORTUNITY SET THAT CARBON

02:34:55.152 --> 02:34:57.488
SEQUESTRATION- BECAUSE OF LAND

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:58.722
MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT WE CAN

02:34:58.789 --> 02:35:02.626
USE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT-

02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:05.863
D. THE TREND LINES DON'T TELL

02:35:05.929 --> 02:35:07.798
US WHERE THIS IS OCCURRING.

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:12.636
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND- AND HOW- IT.

02:35:12.703 --> 02:35:15.172
WHETHER THIS IS A CANTON LIKE

02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:17.041
APPROACH PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO

02:35:17.107 --> 02:35:18.842
IT TO THIS CONVERSION OR IF IT

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.844
THERE IS A SOME TYPE OF THE

02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:22.913
PHYSICAL- YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHICAL

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:24.648
STRATEGY OF WE'RE OR NOT TRAGIC

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:27.017
THAT RATIONALE FOR WHY CERTAIN

02:35:27.084 --> 02:35:28.852
LAND IS COMING OUT OF

02:35:28.919 --> 02:35:31.088
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND-

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:34.291
AND WITH IT AND IF ON A MAP.

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:36.193
THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO US

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:38.896
WHERE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO-

02:35:38.962 --> 02:35:41.799
IN VANCE- AGRICULTURAL LAND

02:35:41.865 --> 02:35:45.602
PROTECTIONS- BECAUSE OF THE

02:35:45.669 --> 02:35:48.505
RISK OF- OF DESTROYING WHAT

02:35:48.572 --> 02:35:50.574
COULD POTENTIALLY BE. BOTH

02:35:50.641 --> 02:35:52.009
AGRICULTURALLY IMPORTANT LAND

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:53.310
ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPORTANT LAND

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:54.645
BUT ALSO FROM A FIRE BREAK

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:57.014
PERSPECTIVE- OPENING THAT UP AS

02:35:57.081 --> 02:35:58.882
WELL AND TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:01.051
THERE'S DATA TO SUPPORT. I'VE

02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:05.022
GOT MAPS I'VE GOTTA. I JUST

02:36:05.089 --> 02:36:06.623
AHEAD FIVE MINUTE YEAH. I HAD-

02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:08.559
THERE'S NO. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

02:36:08.625 --> 02:36:12.863
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- SINCE

02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:13.497
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND A HALF

02:36:13.564 --> 02:36:15.699
T. DID A NATIONAL REPORT CALLED

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:17.935
FARMING ON THE EDGE- THE

02:36:18.001 --> 02:36:19.336
CENTRAL VALLEY BUT IN

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:20.337
PARTICULAR THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:22.539
VALLEY. WAS IN THE TOP TEN IN

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:24.308
THE IN THE NATION AND ACTUALLY

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.076
THAT'S WHY WE ESTABLISHED OUR

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:28.412
FIRST OFFICE IN VISALIA. BACK

02:36:28.479 --> 02:36:29.379
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WERE NOT

02:36:29.446 --> 02:36:32.683
THERE ANYMORE- BUT- YEAH AND I

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:34.585
WOULD ALSO SAY OF PORTIONS OF

02:36:34.651 --> 02:36:35.986
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THOSE ARE

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:37.287
THE THAT THE TWO THAT ARE

02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:39.823
ALWAYS AT THE TOP- OTHER

02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:41.592
REGIONS IS IT KIND OF A COUNTY

02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:43.694
BY COUNTY. BASIS OBVIOUSLY

02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:46.296
LOCAL LAND USE POLICY AND HOW

02:36:46.363 --> 02:36:49.900
THAT IS- SUPPORTED. PLAYS A BIG

02:36:49.967 --> 02:36:53.137
ROLE IN FARMLAND LOSS AND ALSO

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:55.339
THE ECONOMICS OF THE AREA I

02:36:55.405 --> 02:36:57.574
MEAN IT IF THERE'S A CITY OR A

02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:59.743
TOWN THAT NEEDS TO DEVELOP TO

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:01.245
KEEP THEIR ECONOMIC ENGINE

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:02.346
GOING AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:37:02.412 --> 02:37:04.448
INCENTIVES. TO STAY IN FARMING

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:06.083
AND FARMERS DON'T HAVE A

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:08.385
SUCCESSOR AND THEY NEED TO SELL

02:37:08.452 --> 02:37:09.686
TO A DEVELOPER BECAUSE THAT'S

02:37:09.753 --> 02:37:11.255
THEIR MAIN OPTION SO THERE'S

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.990
MANY MANY FACTORS BUT WE COULD

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.993
CERTAINLY HELP YOU- PRIORITIZE.

02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:17.194
IF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED BECAUSE

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:18.362
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:20.063
MONEY TO SAVE ALL THE FARM LAND

02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:22.299
THAT WE HAVE AND- IN THE LOSS

02:37:22.366 --> 02:37:24.301
IN CONVERGENCE COULD BE RETAIL

02:37:24.368 --> 02:37:27.437
HOUSING DORMANCY ANY NUMBER OF

02:37:27.504 --> 02:37:29.139
OTHER REASONS TO YEAH. REALLY

02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:31.175
RURAL RANCH THAT'S- ARE THE

02:37:31.241 --> 02:37:33.243
NUMBER ONE LOW DENSITY HOUSING

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:34.678
I WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW I.

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:36.180
REPORT THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR

02:37:36.246 --> 02:37:38.882
CALLED FARMS UNDER THREAT. AND

02:37:38.949 --> 02:37:41.585
IT DEFINITELY IS LOW DENSITY.

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:44.822
SPRAWL MORE THAN URBAN DENSITY

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:48.325
DEVELOPMENT OKAY THANK YOU VERY

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:48.892
MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME GREAT TO

02:37:48.959 --> 02:37:51.161
FEEL. GREAT QUESTIONS

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.801
POINT AN INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE

COUNTY- BUT THIS TOPIC OF FIRES

02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:29.399
IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME

02:38:29.466 --> 02:38:30.868
BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN SONOMA

02:38:30.934 --> 02:38:32.002
COUNTY IN THE CITY OF SANTA

02:38:32.069 --> 02:38:33.804
ROSA WHEN THE TUBBS FIRE

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:35.472
DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN

02:38:35.539 --> 02:38:37.941
