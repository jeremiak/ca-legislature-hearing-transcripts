AND THE NEWNESS OF THE TRUCKS.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.771
ISN'T AS A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.105
THEM AS IT IS FOR SOMEBODY LIKE

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.208

TRUCK. AND SO. IN THIS

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.881
REGULATION OF IF THE CHECK

ENGINE LIGHTS ON SO THERE ARE

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:04.550
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF SENSORS

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:09.689
ON THESE TRUCKS. AND JUST TO BE

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:10.256
HONEST WITH YOU THE THEN THE

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.358
TRUCK THAT I HAVE THAT IS. CARB

COMPLIANT THAT HAS ALL THE.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.863
THINGS I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE ON

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.998
IT FOR IS IN THE SHOP ALL THE

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.368
TIME BECAUSE OF. A SENSOR GOES

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.137
OUT OR OR AND IT'S NOT DUE TO

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:25.671
THE AIR QUALITY PART OF IT

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:29.442
COULD BE. QUITE FRANKLY JUSTICE

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.944
CENTER WENT BAD AND- TRIPS

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.180
CODES LILY HUNDRDS OF CODES

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.949
GET TRIPPED ON THESE TRUCKS AND

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.051
SO YOU'RE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:39.652
AT THAT CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:43.222
ON. DEAR SAYING THAT TRUCKS

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.957
GOING TO BE RED TAG OR HAS TO

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.959
BE TAKEN SHOP IT'S A HUNDRED

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.562
AND- ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.196
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS AND

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.864
A HUNDRED MILE TRIP TO THE SHOP

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.633
BECAUSE I'D THEY DON'T ALLOW US

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.568
TO HAVE THE COMPUTER TO HOOK IN

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:56.969
WHICH IS REALLY THOUSANDS OF

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.571
DOLLARS. TO HAVE ONE IF YOU DO

00:08:58.638 --> 00:08:59.939
TERM THE REPAIR GUYS HAVE BUT

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:02.208
AS FOR ME TO HUNDRED AND TEN

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.142
MILES TO THE PETERBILT

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.511
DEALERSHIP THAT MY TRUCK

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.112
PLUGGED IN. AND A TWO HUNDRED

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:08.114
DOLLAR BILL. AND THEN

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.383
WHATEVER'S CAN BE THE CENSOR

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:11.517
SOMETIMES IT'S- COULDN'T IT CAN

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:14.754
BE. THE DRIVER AIR MADE A

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.389
SENSOR TRIP AND THEN THEY JUST

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.024
RESET IT. BUT THEY STILL CHARGE

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.759
YOU SO I THINK THAT PART OF THE

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.428
BILL IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.696
THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LONG WAY

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.598
FROM WHERE THE TRUCKS GET

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.666
SERVICED NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.935
TWO. IT CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:29.969
WITH THEIR QUALITY SYSTEM THAT

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.504
CAUSES THE TRIBUNAL WHICH THE

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.838
TRUCK IS RIGHT. RUNNING

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.341
PROPERLY. SO THE OFFICER THAT

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.209
IS GONNA BE. THE ISSUE THE

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.678
COMMERCIAL GUYS ANOTHER THING

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:42.181
I. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:42.782
DAY IS THAT THESE THESE TRUCKS

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:44.884
ARE EXPECTED EVERY NINETY DAYS.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.851
EVERY NINETY DAYS YOU HAVE TO

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.420
HAVE A C. H. P. STICKER IN YOUR

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:48.654
WINDOW THAT. SHOWS TO THEM THAT

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.324
YOU'VE BEEN INSPECTED. THAT'S

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.527
THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT. SO.

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:55.828
YOUR REQUIRE IN IT IF IT AND

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:59.231
THAT'S TYPICALLY. IF WE GO TO

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.933
IT IF WE GO INTO THE THEY'VE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.735
THEY'VE TRIPPED LOOK AT THE CO

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:03.336
ANYWAY THE POINT OF IT IS THE

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:05.638
STRUCTURE VERY MUCH INSPECTED.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.306
NOT ONLY BY THE DRIVER EVERY

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.675
DAY IT'S REQUIRED THAT YOU DO

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:13.012
IT. A PRE TRIP INSPECTION. AND

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.513
THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NINETY

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.282
DAY INSPECTION BY A COMMERCIAL

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.250
OFFICER OR GO THROUGH A SCALE

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.820
WHERE THEY CAN CERTIFY THAT.

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.088
NUMBER TWO. WHEN THERE'S

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.122
SEVERAL THINGS THIS BILL WE'RE

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.557
CHARGING US MORE MONEY YOU'RE

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.825
GIVING MORE POWER TO THE AIR

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.627
RESOURCES BOARD. I JUST THINK

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:33.099
THIS IS. GONNA BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:35.334
THE SMALL SMALLER GUYS. LIKE

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.371
MYSELF OF EVEN MORE HARDSHIP

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:39.138
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.240
IN A THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.808
HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.311
MEETING THE TEAR FOR.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.712
COMPLIANCE IS AND IT IN THESE

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.981
ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.751
AND THEY DON'T WORKED OUT WELL.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.586
DIAZ WE THEY WENT FROM. OF

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.321
MOTHER SYSTEM TO WHAT WE CALL A

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.990
DEAF SYSTEM WHICH IS. IS

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:01.193
ACTUALLY PUTTING YOUR RIA. INTO

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.561
THE SYSTEM TO HELP BURN AT A

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.397
HIGHER RATE. WHICH WERE NOT

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:05.664
EVEN IT EATS UP THE EXHAUST

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.966
PIPES BY THE WAY SO I'M NOT

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:07.566
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT'S

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.468
GONNA DO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT-

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:11.070
BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AIR

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:13.105
AND MAYBE NOT. THE OTHER PARTS

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.174
OF THAT THAT BECAUSE WE FORCED

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.442
MANUFACTURERS TO MEET MEET A

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.879
STANDARD. SO FIRST SEVERAL

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.480
THOSE REASONS IS MONICA WILL

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.150
SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I THINK

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:27.219
IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO.

00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:28.687
REGULATE FOR ONE IS GONNA BE A

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.523
HARDSHIP ON PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.158
TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING ON TOP

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.926
OF ALL THE OTHER REGULATIONS

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.196
THAT HAVE BEEN PILED ON AS AN

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:37.797
DRIVE THE COST OF FREIGHT UP.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.599
IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THOSE

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.167
REASONS OF THE OPPOSING THE

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.437
BILL. YES ENERGY IS IT POSSIBLE

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.938
HE DIVERSE YES ABSOLUTELY SO

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:46.539
ONE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WE

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.339
TOOK AS YOU HEARD THIS WAS IN

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.141
ORDER WHICH COMMITTEE BUT WE

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.443
YOU KNOW YOUHAVE SEVENTY FIVE

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.711
DAYS FOR FIX THE TICKET. THE H.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.947
Q. EMPTY HAS COMMITTED TO US

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.348
THAT THEY WILL DO ON SITE

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.883
TESTING THAT THEY WANT TO DO ON

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.051
SITE TESTING BECAUSE WE DO

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:00.653
UNDERSTAND FOR SOMEONE LIKE

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.954
YOURSELF DRIVING HUNDRED AND

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.023
TEN MILES TO SET TEST CENTER IS

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.858
THAT FEASIBLE AND IN THAT ISN'T

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.593
THE GOAL OF THE OF THE BILL AT

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.464
ALL. YOU KNOW I HEAR WHAT

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.799
YOU'RE SAYING AND WE'VE WE'VE

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.868
DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:18.604
TO MAKE IT FOR THE SMALL GUY OF

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.239
A WAS IS EASY AS POSSIBLE BUT

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:23.342
AS FEASIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND I

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.111
THINK IN PART OF IT WE MAY JUST

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.645
HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE BUT I

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.281
DO KNOW THAT. THEY CAN BE IS

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:30.716
TRYING TO DO ON SITE TESTING

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:31.817
BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD AS WE'VE

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.452
SAID THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM WE

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.488
DID CHANGE IT FROM FORTY FIVE

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:36.822
DAY FIX THE TICKET TO A SEVENTY

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.357
FIVE DAY FIX THAT TICKET

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.225
BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.293
FARMERS AND GROWERS WAS THAT.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.628
THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT DURING

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.796
THE SEASON WHEN THE HARVESTING

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.731
THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS WAS

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.533
REASONABLE I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.171
REASONABLE BUT WE. WE HEARD

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:52.805
THOSE CONCERNS SO WE CHANGED IT

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:56.942
TO SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. MISTER

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:57.843
CHAIRMAN YESTERDAY I JUST AMEND

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.677
MY ANSWERS CENTER WACO SKI

00:12:58.744 --> 00:12:59.745
BECAUSE I DID LEAVE OUT ONE

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:00.479
THERE IS A LIMITED FOUR YEAR

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:01.747
EXEMPTION. FOR NEW VEHICLES

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.083
MEETING THE- OPTIONAL WILL

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.221
KNOCK STANDARD SET BY A R. B.

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.056
THE OTHER. NEW CAR THAT THAT'S

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.125
RIGHT THAT THE CLEANEST TRUCKS

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:16.595
WOULD GET FOR YEARS WE LOOK AT

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:17.163
THE MOMENT CENTER YES I WILL

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:20.699
OKAY. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS YES

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.201
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ONE IT IS

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:23.169
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:24.336
PREVIOUSLY HIGHLIGHTED WHICH I

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:25.171
SHOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:27.039
HIGHLIGHTED IN MY TESTIMONY WAS

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.307
THAT THIS BILL APPLIES TO OUT

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.875
OF STATE VEHICLES AND SO THAT'S

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.377
REALLY IMPORTANT. THEY WILL

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.444
HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.213
AND WE HOPE THAT THAT ACTUALLY

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.781
INCREASES COMPETITIVENESS FOR

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:38.617
CALIFORNIA TRUCKERS BECAUSE WE

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:39.919
KNOW THAT MOST OF THEM ARE

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.020
DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.722
MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES WHERE

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:44.190
IS. A LOT OF THE GROSS

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:44.823
POLLUTERS ARE COMING ACROSS THE

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.525
BORDER. SO WITH THE IMPACT ON

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:28.701
FOLKS ON OUR ROAD HERE. IN THE

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:31.103
