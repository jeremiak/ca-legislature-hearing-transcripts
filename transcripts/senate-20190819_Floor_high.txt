AS YOU KNOW MEMBERS MISTER RAMOS WAS IMMEDIATE PRESS PRESIDENT A PAST CHAIRMAN EXCUSE ME OF THE SAN MANUEL BAND. OF MISSION INDIANS. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO IS COMMENTS OF MISTER RAMOS AND RECOGNIZING GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER. WHICH ISSUED AN APOLOGY TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR A STATE HISTORICAL WRONGDOINGS AGAINST IT OF AMERICANS. MEMBERS YOUR STATE IS RELATIVELY YOUNG WHEN IT COMES TO OUR OFFICIAL STATEHOOD. WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DEEP AND STORIED HISTORY THAT BEGUN BEFORE MANY OF OUR PREDECESSORS ARRIVED HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MORE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATIVE AMERICANS NATIVE PEOPLES OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SHAPE THE COURSE OF THE STATE THROUGHOUT A VERY LONG HISTORY. WHICH PREDATES ANY INCORPORATION. IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE THIS CULTURAL HERITAGE AND KEEP THE LEGACY OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S ALIVE. SOME YEARS AGO I WAS PROUD TO ESTABLISH THE SEALS COMMISSION. SALES COMMISSION WHICH PLACE TWO SEALS AT THE FOOT OF THE WEST STEPS OF THE CAPITOL ONE CELEBRATING OUR SPANISH MEXICAN HERE IT IS UP TO CHEN IS THREE AND THE OTHER CELEBRATING FORTY GENERATIONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SEALS ARE THERE TO REMIND US. THE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE MEMBERS LIES IN OUR CONTINUED STRENGTH OF OUR DIVERSITY AND A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PAST. BILL THE CELEBRATE OUR HISTORY THE SEALS ARE INDEED A TESTAMENT TO THE CULTURAL HERITAGE THAT IS VERY MUCH STILL ALIVE AND ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.

THANK YOU CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO RISE ON BEHALF OF SR FIFTY THREE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF CALIFORNIA AS A SOCIETY AND OUR HISTORY RECENTLY IN MY DISTRICT AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG DISCOVERED. HE GOT AYE AYE. OF EVIDENCE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO. AND IF YOU THINK OF WHEN WE OFTEN TO THINK OF THE OF THE THEORIES OF PEOPLE COMING OVER THE BERING STRAIT TO POPULATE CALIFORNIA THIS THIS PREDATES THAT BY TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS SO WE HAD PEOPLE LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND MY GUESS BUT THEY WERE THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT ARE SOME OF WHICH STILL EXIST IN CALIFORNIA. AND AUTHORS BUT NO LONGER EXIST A TRIBE IN THE MODOC AREA KNOWN AS THE YA HE NO LONGER EXIST WHY BECAUSE THEY WERE ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF GENOCIDE. WHEN GENOCIDE IS PART OF OUR HISTORY PART OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY PART OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT GENOCIDE THERE ARE NO OTHER CULTURES KNOW THE PEOPLE. IN IN AMERICAN IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE THE VICTIMS OF GENOCIDE HONOR NATIVE SOIL OTHER THAN THE NATIVES OF THE SOIL THE NATIVE AMERICANS. WHO STILL. ARE ARE IN A STATE OF SUFFERING IN OUR STATE THEY ARE POSSESS SOME OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN THE STATE SOME OF THE HIGHEST. DROP OUT RATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES THE NATIVE AMERICANS. OR OR SOME OF THE ARE OR IT'S SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE STATE THAT ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST THE MOST THREE PART OF THIS ECONOMY AND STILL STRUGGLING FROM YEARS OF ATTEMPTED GENOCIDE AND YEARS OF INEQUALITY IN YEARS OF PERSECUTION. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE I'M I'M I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A. A PART OF THE SENATE RECOGNIZING OR OR NATIVE CULTURES PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE THE STATE AS RICH AS IT IS BUT ALSO IT'S A REMINDER TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE THAT WE HAVE MUCH MANY SINCE TO ATONE FOR. AS AS THE INHERITORS OF OUR STATE AS THE LEADERS OF THE STATE. FIGHTING TO. CREATE MORE QUALITY IN THE STATE BUT LET'S NOT FORGET OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS THAT ARE STILL STRUGGLING TODAY. IN THIS VERY STATE THAT WE LOVE SO MUCH PLEASE SUPPORT US ARE FIFTY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER HUESO CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU ARE MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I THANK THE SENATOR FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION TO US TODAY AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT BUT- I DO FEEL LIKE THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE DID WE NEED TO HAVE EVEN MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE- TREATMENT OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN OUR HISTORY I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP. AND APOLOGIZING FOR ACTIONS OF THE- STATE AGAINST OUR- BROTHERS AND SISTERS BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT WE SHOULD DO. IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT OF OUR STATE LEADERS YES OUR STATE LEADERS PEOPLE. WHO MADE SOME VERY BAD CHOICES IN OUR HISTORY HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE IT WAY BEYOND THE RESOLUTION THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE ON. PERSONALLY AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS HISTORY MATTERS. TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY MATTERS. I WAS A TEACHER MY PAST LIFE AND- WHEN YOU LOOK BACK INTO THE HISTORY BOOKS. MOST YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN IN FOURTEEN NINETY TWO COLUMBUS SAILED THE OCEAN BLUE AND ALL IS WELL AFTER THAT IN FACT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND I THINK. THIS MUCH CELEBRATION IS WE HAVE TO DO AROUND THIS IMPORTANT DAY. CELEBRATIONS NOT ENOUGH THERE NEEDS TO BE RECTIFICATION. AND UNTIL WE CHANGE. THE WAY WE TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. AND STARTING WITH OUR OWN HOLIDAYS AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZE AS THE TRUTH OF HISTORY. THESE INJUSTICES WILL STILL NOT BE RECTIFIED. AND I WOULD HOPE PERHAPS IN FUTURE YEARS WHEN WE PASSED SIMILAR RESOLUTIONS IN FACT EVEN SOME OF THE ICONOGRAPHY HAVE THIS BUILDING STARTS TO SHIFT AND RECOGNIZE OUR HISTORY. I THINK OUT TO THAT ROTUNDA. WITH COLUMBUS. SITTING THERE BESTOWING QUEEN ISABELLA AND THE CELEBRATIONS THAT ARE INHERENT IN THAT RECOGNITION AT THE CENTER PIECE OF THIS CAPITAL. I THINK. THAT'S CULTURE PROBABLY BELONGS MORE APPROPRIATELY IN A MUSEUM. BUT NOT AS A PLACE OF HISTORY. AND SO I HOPE TO WORK WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS NOT JUST IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY BUT ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS CULTURES ACROSS THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND SO MANY OTHER CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS STATE ARE TO TELL A NEW STORY. TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR HISTORY. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU CENTER CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SRFIFTY THREE AND I BRING RECOGNITION TO THE MANY NATIVE AMERICANS WHO SERVED. OUR GREAT NATION AND ARMED FORCES AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU THINK OF THE VETERANS WHO SERVED. IN WORLD WAR TWO YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THE CODE TALKERS NAVAJO. CODE TALKERS AS THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AMONG THEMSELVES. THAT SAVE. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES ENABLE G. BUT- TARA IN ALL THE PLACES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC. WERE MARINES WERE FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY LOSING THEIR LIVES. FOR OUR COUNTRY BUT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NAVAJO TRIBESMEN THAT WERE THERE IN BACK THEN THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE REFERRED TO AS TRIBESMEN BUT THEY WERE REFERRED TO IN OUR EYES AS A VETERAN THAT I AM. AS HEROES AND THEY PROTECTED THE CODE THE SECRET CODES THAT WERE COMMUNICATED FROM BACK AND FORTH FROM UNIT TO UNIT. AND THE JAPANESE WERE NOT ABLE TO BREAK THAT CODE. AND AS YOU'VE ALL SEEN AND WATCHING THE SEE THE BEAUTIFUL MONUMENT WITH THE MARINES ARE HOSTING THE FLAG ABOVE. MONTEIRO BOCCE IN IN A REGINA ANYONE OF A NATIVE AMERICAN. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CONTRIBUTION THAT'S BEEN MADE BY THE NATIVE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY AND TODAY WE RECOGNIZE YOU AS WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS YOU GIVEN TO US THE MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL WALKS OF LIFE. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THIS DAY AND THIS IS WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR PAN.

WE DON'T THINK THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY MOST OF HISTORY CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY EXISTED FOR THE COMING OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO THIS WONDERFUL LAND AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT WERE RECOGNIZING THIS IS RESOLUTION I ALSO WANT TO THANKS RIGHT NOW IN THE PAST BUDGET BUDGETS WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ESTABLISHING A NAME. A MUSEUM WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE PARTICULAR USED TO LEARN MORE HEALTH IS WELCOME CORPORATION THIS INFORMATION INTO OUR CURRICULA BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT ARE THAT CALIFORNIANS UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY GOES BACK TO THE NAY AMERICAN. CULTURES AND CIVILIZATIONS ARE HERE FOR MILLENNIA AND THEY HAVE A PROUD HISTORY AND THAT HISTORY NEEDS REMEMBER AND WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW REMEMBER THE ATROCITIES OUR UNFORTUNATELY EXPECTED ON THEM AS WELL AND MORE RECENT HISTORY AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO RESURRECT.

THANK YOU I'M MATTER MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT OF SR FIFTY THREE. AND SOME OF YOU MAY AS. READ THE NEW YORK SUNDAY TIMES ON THIS LATEST ISSUE. THE SUNDAY MAGAZINE THIS WAS YESTERDAY FEATURED. THE US IS HISTORY ON SLAVERY. AND IT PARTICULARLY MARKED. SIXTEEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN FOURTEEN NINETEEN SIXTY NINETEEN I'M SORRY RIGHT . AS YOU'RE RIGHT FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IS COLUMBUS SIXTEEN NINETEEN AS WHAT THEY FELT WAS THE FOUNDING OF THIS COUNTRY VERSES OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE REASON THAT THE FOCUS WAS ON SIXTEEN NINETEEN IN AUGUST ACTUALLY IT WAS THE FIRST SLAVE SHIP. THAT HIT THE UNITED STATES OR THE BLAND WE NOW CALL. AND THE ARTICLES THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY MOVING BUT THE THERE'S MUCH IN IT. ABOUT THE. LEGACY OF VIOLENCE THAT OUR COUNTRY STILL SUFFERS UNDER. AND I WAS STRUCK AGAIN BY IT TODAY. WITH THE SIGNING OF OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SPILLED GOVERNOR NEWSOME SIGNING AROUND ARE CHANGING IN THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE AND WE HAVE WE ARE VERY VIOLENT COUNTRY. AND WE OFTEN IS WORK WHY WHY ARE WE WHY DO WE HAVE MORE MASS SHOOTINGS WHY DO WE HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE WHY DO WE HAVE SO MUCH OF THIS VIOLENCE SO IMBEDDED IN THE U. S. COMPARED TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER. ECONOMY OF OUR OF OUR CLAPPED AND DE THE WHOLE FOCUS OF THIS MAGAZINE IS AROUND SLAVERY AS ONE EXPLANATION IN IT'S A SIGNIFICANT EXPLANATION BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO INCLUDE OUR GENOCIDE. OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN THAT. IT IS EQUALLY AS VIOLENT OF HISTORY WHERE WE LITERALLY. MADE IT LEGAL TWO AND GAVE REWARDS. JUST AS WE GAVE REWARDS AND MADE IT LEGAL TO KILL ESCAPED SLAVES WE GAVE REWARDS AND MADE IT LEGAL TO KILL NATIVE AMERICANS. AND WE ASSISTED OUR OWN GOVERNMENT ARMY PROVIDED NATIVE AMERICANS WITH A SMALL POX INFECTED BLANKETS FOR EXAMPLE. SO I THINK THAT WE CAN NEVER STOP REMINDING OURSELVES OF THESE. LEGACIES AND HOW THEY STILL IMPACT NOT ONLY NATIVE CALIFORNIANS TO NATIVE AMERICANS BUT ALL OF US AND EVERYTHING IN OUR CULTURE. I WAS VERY PROUD IN THE LAST YEAR THAT I SERVED IN THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL WHICH WAS NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND IT WAS THE SEX QUINN CINDY EISNER PRONOUNCES WORDS RIGHT BUT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF WHEN COLUMBUS SHOWED UP ON OUR SHORES. AND OF COURSE WE NOW UNDERSTAND THE COLUMBUS WAS NOT THE FIRST AT ALL TO BE HERE. AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF NATIVE AMERICANS WHO APPROACHED ME AND ASKED ME TO SEE WHETHER. BERKELEY WOULD BE WILLING TO CALL THAT DAY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE STAY. SO I CARRIED THAT. ORDINANCE IT WAS THE FIRST ORDINANCE ADOPTED IN THE U. S. BERKLEE HAS HONORED INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY OR WHAT WAS COLUMBUS DAY. SINCE THAT TIME. AND WE HAVE HAD AN ALL TRIBES POWER WELL ON THAT WEEKEND. EVERY WEEKEND SINCE AND WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER IN OCTOBER COMING UP THIS YEAR. SO I VERY PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND VERY VERY. HAPPY YOU'RE HAPPY IS WRONG WORD BUT- HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE LEGACIES ARE AND THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T JUST IMPACTS SOMEONE IMPACT US TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. I'M SORRY CENTER GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AND THE S.

AND COUNCILS WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATION CURRICULUM ITS AIR AS WE FOCUS ON THE PAST SO THAT WE DON'T EVER REPEAT IT LET'S ALSO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE AND RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A FEDERAL RECOGNIZED TRIBE AND THEY HAVE DESIGNATED LAND SET ASIDE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THAT LAND IS TRULY A SOVEREIGN NATION WHICH OPERATES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE OUT LANDS NEEDS AND THOSE SOVEREIGN NATIONS NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN RULES AND FORTY. OVER THAT LAND IN THEIR RESOURCES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO EDUCATE PEOPLE WHEN THEY READ THIS CREEK LIMóN STUDENTS UNDERSTAND AS THEY GROW UP AND THEY READ THROUGH THIS AT THE UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND MOVING FORWARD WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT TO FIBER COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN OUR TRIBAL REGIONS SO.

NOT EVERYONE WHO TAKES OPIOIDS BECOMES ADDICTED BUT THERE IS A VERY HIGH RISK FOR BECOMING DRUG DEPENDENT WHEN USING OPIOIDS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT MIGHT TAKE FOR WHEN TO BECOME ADDICTED TO THE DRUG CAN VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON. TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS FIRST USE OPIOIDS WHEN THEY ARE PRESCRIBED TO THEM FOLLOWING AN INJURY A ROUTINE PROCEDURE LIKE THE REMOVAL OF WISDOM TEETH.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE SENATOR ROTH AND SENATOR STONED. WITH ON REGARDING CHP OFFICER MORESO WILL START WITH YOU SENATOR ROCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. MONDAY AUGUST TWELFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A DEADLY STARTED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DAY FOR THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD OFFICER ANDRE MORLEY. HE LEFT HIS HOME IN MARINO VALLEY PROBABLY GAVE HIS BRIDE OF THREE YEARS SIR KISS OR A HUG. CLIMBED ON HIS MOTORCYCLE AND STARTED TO SHIFT AS A MOTOR OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. HE MAY HAVE EVEN CALLED HIS PARENTS HIS STEPFATHER OR ONE OR MORE OF HIS FIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. TO TALK ABOUT HIS LIFE AND HIS JOB. IN FACT HE WAS FULL OF LIFE. AND IT WAS A JOB HE LOVED HE REFERRED TO IT AS HIS DREAM JOB RIDING THE MOTORCYCLE THAT HE LOVED AND SERVING OTHERS IN A WAY THAT HE LOVED. OTHERS LOVE HIM TO IN FACT THEY SAY HE HAD A BIG HEART. AND IT SHOWED. LATER THAT SAME DAY AT APPROXIMATELY FIVE THIRTY FIVE PM WHILE PATROLLING THE TWO FIFTEEN FREEWAY IN THE VICINITY OF RIVERSIDE. OFFICER VOICE BY THE SPOTTED A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK WITH A SINGLE OCCUPANT DRIVING IN THE CAR POOL LANE. HE INITIATED A TRAFFIC STOP BUT THE EAST RIDGE INTERSECTION. THE DRIVER APPARENTLY HAD EXPIRED DRIVER'S LICENSE AND NO CURRENT VEHICLE REGISTRATION. OFFICER MORE DETERMINED BUT THE PICKUP NOT PICK UP TRUCK NEEDED TO BE IMPOUNDED AND HE BEGAN TO INITIATE THE IMPASSE POUND. AS HE DID SO. THE DRIVER GRABBED THE NAY ARE FIFTEEN STYLE RIFLE FROM THE TRUCK AND STARTED FIRING AT OFFICER MORE. ALTHOUGH MORTALLY WOUNDED BY THE FIRE OFFICER MORE MANAGED TO RETURN FIRE HAS HE CALLED FOR BACKUP. MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS RESPONDED TO THAT CALL AND ACCORDING TO OUR RIVERSIDE. CHIEF OF POLICE SERGIO DE AS THE GUN BATTLE WAS LONG AND HORRIFIC. A GUN BATTLE FRANKLY WITNESSED BY ONE OF MY OWN DISTRICT STAFF ON HIS WAY HOME IN HIS CAR STOPPED AT THAT SAME EASTRIDGE INTERSECTION. TWO OF THE CHP OFFICERS WHO RESPONDED TO THE CALL FOR HELP WERE WOUNDED ONE CRITICALLY. WELL THEY BOTH SURVIVED THAT DAY TRAGICALLY OFFICER MAURY DID NOT. NOW OF THE DRIVER OF THE PICKUP WHO WAS KILLED DURING THE GUN BATTLE WAS A CONVICTED FELON. SOMEONE WHO SERVED HIS TIME. BUT WAS NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO OWN A FIREARM. HIS RIFLE REPORTEDLY WAS A GHOST GUN. THE FIRM ASSEMBLED FROM PARTS NOT A WEAPON PURCHASE FROM A GUN STORE OR AT A GUN SHOW. BUT EVERY BIT AS DEADLY. FRANKLY A WEAPON AND PARTS THE DRIVER SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE. THE TRAGEDY HERE OF COURSE IS THAT HE DID. AND THAT HE AMBUSHED OFFICER MOORE WHO WAS SIMPLY ATTEMPTING TO DO HIS JOB. TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AND TO PROTECT ALL OF THE REST OF US. NO IT'S A VERY VERY DANGEROUS JOB THAT THESE OFFICERS HAVE DEALING WITH PEOPLE DOING THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING FACING PEOPLE WHO POSSESS THINGS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO POSSESS AND YET THESE OFFICERS REPORT TO THEIR POSTS. AND STAY ON THEIR WATCH. UP AND DOWN OUR STATE EVERY DAY. NOW I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES DURING THE YEAR WHEN WE EACH OF US SEE A PEACE OFFICER ON THE STREET IN A PATROL CAR ON A MOTORCYCLE OR EVEN IN THIS VERY BUILDING THAT WE TAKE THAT OFFICER AND HIS OR HER ROLE. FOR GRANTED AT BEST. WELL RECENT EVENTS IN OHIO AND STATES AROUND THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING THIS ONE DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY DON'T TAKE OUR SAFETY FOR GRANTED. EVER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE WITH OFFICER MORE. OFFICER. ANDRE MORE JUNIOR END OF WATCH AUGUST TWELFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MAY HE REST IN PEACE. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH SENATOR STONE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND I JOIN MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF AND MORE A- WHO IS A PROUD CHP OFFICER WHO WAS MURDERED ON MONDAY. BY A CAREER CRIMINAL. WHO SHOULD NEVER BEEN LET OUT OF JAIL IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT IS TOO OFTEN THE CASE OFFICER MOREY'S DEATH STARTED WITH THE SO CALLED ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP. HE PULLED OVER THE MURDERS TRUCK IN RIVERSIDE AND STARTED FILLING OUT PAPERWORK TO IMPOUND THE VEHICLE. THAT'S WHEN OFFICER MORE HIS LIFE WAS STRIPPED AWAY FROM HIS FRIENDS HIS FAMILY HIS LOVED ONES. WHEN UP FROM WHERE HE WAS FILLING OUT THE PAPERWORK THE KILLER REACHED INSIDE THE VEHICLE IMPLIED A RIFLE. AND SHOT OFFICER MORE A. THANKFULLY FOR THE OTHER POTENTIAL VICTIMS A CH P. HERO WAS ABLE TO GET TO HIS RADIO LET THE OTHER OFFICERS KNOW THAT HE NEEDED ASSISTANCE. THAT CALL. MORE RESULTING IN TWO MORE OFFICERS BEING WOUNDED IN THE LINK THEY SHOOT OUT. PROBABLY SAVED INNOCENT LIVES. SHOT BY ASSISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. WHAT IS ESPECIALLY TRAGIC ABOUT THIS MURDER IS IT IT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN. OFF THE MORTGAGE KILLER WAS A CAREER CRIMINAL WITH A VIOLENT HISTORY. IF YOU WERE KEPT IN PRISON WHERE HE BELONGED OFFICER MAURY WAS STILL BE ALIVE DOING ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT HE DID TO KEEP CALIFORNIA SAFE.
