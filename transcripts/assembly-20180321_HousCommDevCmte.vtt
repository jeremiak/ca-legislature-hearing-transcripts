SEVENTEEN.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.373 region:rollup2
THEY ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:09.675 region:rollup2
NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:12.144 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS

ARE ON OUR STREETS WHICH OF MANY

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:14.546 region:rollup2

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:15.948 region:rollup2
UNDERCOUNT.

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:17.416 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:19.318 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:21.387 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS LEADS TO ADDITIONAL

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:23.088 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR GOVERNMENT WHEN IT

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:24.189 region:rollup2

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:29.561 region:rollup2

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:44.009 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE IS A BILL FOCUSED ON

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.811 region:rollup2
HOMELESS DATA COLLECTION. IT

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:47.146 region:rollup2
WOULD ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE

00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:49.748 region:rollup2
DATABASE TO COMPILE AND

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:51.050 region:rollup2

FINANCE COUNCIL TO DO THAT. THIS

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:57.222 region:rollup2

SINCE.

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:38.090 region:rollup2
IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY BECAUSE

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.644 region:rollup2
OF THE CURRENT COST OF THE

DOING NOTHING.

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:03.048 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE THE

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:04.416 region:rollup2
COSTS THAT ARE BEING GENERATED

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:06.051 region:rollup2
BY PEOPLE NOT GETTING THE

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:08.153 region:rollup2
HOUSING THAT THEY NEED NOT BEING

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:09.721 region:rollup2
STABLE HOUSE TO NOT BEING ABLE

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.723 region:rollup2

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.331 region:rollup2
AND.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:19.831 region:rollup2
I I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY ONE MORE

00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:21.333 region:rollup2
THING WHICH IS THAT IN

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.200 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING. AB TWENTY ONE

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.769 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE IT'S GOING TO BE

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.204 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO BRING AND THE

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.005 region:rollup2
VARIOUS CONTINUANCE OF CARE

00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.941 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:31.209 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE DATA WILL BE

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:32.644 region:rollup2
SHARED AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:34.780 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY A PLATFORM THAT

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:36.548 region:rollup2
WOULD CONVERSATION ABOUT A

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.083 region:rollup2
SHARED VISION FOR THE STATE OF

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:39.651 region:rollup2
HOW WE GET TO A PATH TO AND

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:41.486 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:42.788 region:rollup2
SO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DATA

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.590 region:rollup2
SOUND

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:46.191 region:rollup2
BORING IN THE ABSTRACT BUT THEY

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.526 region:rollup2

00:35:24.923 --> 00:35:27.125 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ON THE STREETS TO

00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:28.126 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SOLUTIONS

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.794 region:rollup2
ARE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:31.997 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WHAT

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:34.232 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS THAT.

00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:34.866 region:rollup2
WE COLLECT THIS DATA SO WE

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.100 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHO'S HOMELESS ON THE

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.835 region:rollup2
STREETS

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.635 region:rollup2
WHY THEY HOMELESS WHAT SERVICES

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:39.070 region:rollup2
THEY RECEIVE AND WHAT ARE THEY

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:40.138 region:rollup2
NOT RECEIVING. AND WHAT'S

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.740 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND WHAT'S COST

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.608 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.410 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE SPENDING.

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:47.445 region:rollup2
I. PROBABLY THROUGHOUT THE

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.980 region:rollup2
STATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:50.849 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS IN A LOT OF

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.950 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT WE'RE NOT.

00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:53.551 region:rollup2
BRINGING DOWN THOSE NUMBERS IN

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.186 region:rollup2
FACT THEY CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.955 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO BE SMART AND. AND

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:58.790 region:rollup2
HOW WE DO THAT. NOW WITH REGARDS

00:35:56.955 --> 00:36:00.425 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE UP WE ARE AT THIS

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.593 region:rollup2
MOMENT ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:02.961 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

00:36:01.593 --> 00:36:04.462 region:rollup2
THIS AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY I DO

00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:06.231 region:rollup2
NOT THINK IT'S GONNA BE IN THE

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:07.232 region:rollup2
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:08.566 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'LL BE

00:36:07.232 --> 00:36:09.334 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT BUT

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:11.102 region:rollup2
I'D SUGGEST.

00:36:09.334 --> 00:36:13.004 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE A

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:14.506 region:rollup2
PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:16.174 region:rollup2
DECISION TO NOT SPEND A LITTLE

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:17.542 region:rollup2
BIT OF MONEY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.643 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM LOOKS LIKE SO FOR

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:21.112 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:21.913 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES THAT

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:24.049 region:rollup2
HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO BUILD SUPPORT

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.616 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:26.651 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU'RE CHRONICALLY

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:28.153 region:rollup2
HOMELESS A TYPICAL CITIES AND

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:29.454 region:rollup2
COUNTIES SPEND ANYWHERE FROM

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:30.989 region:rollup2
FORTY TO SIXTY TO EIGHTY

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:33.024 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR A

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:34.225 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PERSON WHO

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:36.361 region:rollup2
IS NOT HOUSED IN SUPPORT OF

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:37.395 region:rollup2
HOUSING RATHER THAN SAY FIFTEEN

00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:38.963 region:rollup2
OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.864 region:rollup2
HOUSE AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS WE

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:41.332 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS BECAUSE A COUPLE OF

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:43.968 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS. HAVE HAD THAT

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:45.470 region:rollup2
DATA. AND IF WE CAN COLLECT THAT

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:46.071 region:rollup2
DATA STATEWIDE AND REALLY

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.139 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:48.873 region:rollup2
HELPFUL. WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.576 region:rollup2
WITNESS.

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:53.445 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE LIKELY QUITE A

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:55.313 region:rollup2
FEW HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:36:53.445 --> 00:36:56.414 region:rollup2
TRAVEL FROM CITY TO CITY OR

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:58.616 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO COUNTY TO USE

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:59.684 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT SERVICES. WE KNOW THAT

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:01.052 region:rollup2
ANECDOTALLY BUT WE DON'T KNOW

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:03.054 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT'S COSTING

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:05.223 region:rollup2
US IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.857 region:rollup2
THE CORRECTION SYSTEM THE MENTAL

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:07.292 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE AND

00:37:05.857 --> 00:37:08.059 region:rollup2
SO. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:10.628 region:rollup2
DO IS.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:11.763 region:rollup2
TO INVEST A FEW DOLLARS TO

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:13.665 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS DATA LOOKS

00:37:11.763 --> 00:37:15.266 region:rollup2
LIKE SO WE CAN USE OUR MONEY

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:17.068 region:rollup2
MORE SMARTLY KNOWS FIRST WHERE

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:18.103 region:rollup2
THE MONIES COME FROM YES IT'S

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:19.871 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE TRUE THAT.

00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:21.339 region:rollup2
WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE INVESTING

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:23.274 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY IN HOMELESS SERVICES

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:25.343 region:rollup2
IN THE COMING YEARS AND I WOULD

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.977 region:rollup2
BE FINE IF OF A DECISION WAS

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:28.947 region:rollup2
MADE TO TO PULL SOME OF THAT

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:29.714 region:rollup2
MONEY TO TO ACHIEVE THIS BUT. MY

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:31.116 region:rollup2
BROADER POINT IS.

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:32.550 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS DATA WE

00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:34.586 region:rollup2
WON'T BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.121 region:rollup2
SPEND THOSE MONIES AND SO THAT'S

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:37.522 region:rollup2
REALLY THE POINT OF THE BILL.

00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:39.224 region:rollup2
AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD JUST

00:37:37.522 --> 00:37:40.825 region:rollup2
END BY SAYING I KNOW YOU'RE A

00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:41.993 region:rollup2

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT.

BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:41.246 region:rollup2
THE STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:43.114 region:rollup2

SPENT IN THE FUTURE I THINK IT'S

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:48.786 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD SOLID

THE COUNTY.

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:07.372 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE ANSWERS

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.407 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST

00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:11.910 region:rollup2
FEW DAYS WERE A FEDERAL JUDGE

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:13.678 region:rollup2
HAD TO INTERVENE. AND MANAGE

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.980 region:rollup2
BASICALLY MANAGE THE COUNTY'S

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:17.815 region:rollup2
MONEY BECAUSE THE COUNTY. DID

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.018 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IT HAD

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:21.786 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO CAN'T REALLY CALCULATE

00:40:20.018 --> 00:40:23.187 region:rollup2
HOW MANY HOMELESS. PERSONS THERE

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:24.789 region:rollup2

IN TERMS OF MANAGING THE

00:40:26.858 --> 00:40:31.763 region:rollup2
SITUATION SO WE MUST HAVE GOOD

00:40:28.993 --> 00:40:33.331 region:rollup2

DAD TO IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:58.790 region:rollup2
AT DATA'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO

00:40:57.422 --> 00:41:01.025 region:rollup2
HELP US UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.027 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO HELP US. UNDERSTAND

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:04.429 region:rollup2
THEAPPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS SO WE

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:06.831 region:rollup2
DO A HOMELESS COUNT.

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:08.366 region:rollup2
WITH LOCALS IN OUR COMMUNITY

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.268 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:11.469 region:rollup2
HELPFUL SO I THINK FOR ME MY

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:13.071 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THIS ALSO

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THAT IT'S NOT JUST

00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:16.307 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM IT'S

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:17.542 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING ALSO. THAT

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:19.577 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO LEAD

00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:20.611 region:rollup2
US TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:22.981 region:rollup2
BEST RESPONSE FOR THIS.

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:25.350 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU IS

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:26.851 region:rollup2
ADDED DO WE HAVE ANY IDEAS IN

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.986 region:rollup2
TERMS OF I.

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:29.587 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WILL THIS BE ALIGNED

00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:32.223 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT I THAT WHAT SOME

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:33.324 region:rollup2
COUNTIES MAYBE ALREADY DOING IS

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.892 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH ANY OTHER

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:37.395 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS OR IS THIS REALLY

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:37.995 region:rollup2
AN IDEA TO JUST HAVE A AND IT

00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:38.629 region:rollup2
WILL BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.630 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.531 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LOCAL

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.866 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:43.167 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THIS IN DIFFERENT

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:45.236 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.971 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SHARE DATA WITH EACH

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:48.673 region:rollup2
OTHER BUT IT'S BEEN HARD. AND

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:50.375 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL TASK AS WE

00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:52.276 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW DATA IS HARD TO COLLECT

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:52.777 region:rollup2
AND FIGURE OUT A SHARED IN A WAY

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THAT PROTECTS

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:56.547 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.982 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK EVERYONE FROM LOCAL

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:59.751 region:rollup2
COORDINATING COUNCILS TO

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:01.252 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO THE STATE ALL WANT

00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:02.987 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND BE ABLE TO COMPARE

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:04.455 region:rollup2
NOTES AND AND HOW IT IS THAT WE

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:06.124 region:rollup2
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS GRAY AND

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.458 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK IS A TRANSIENT

00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:09.026 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TO THAT KNOWS THAT.

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.728 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS SOME FOLKS MOVE

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.429 region:rollup2
FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.164 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:14.699 region:rollup2
REALLY VALUE IN SEEING THIS SO

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:16.701 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:17.735 region:rollup2
MOVE THE BILL SINCE WE DO HAVE

00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:19.070 region:rollup2
QUORUM.

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:20.071 region:rollup2
PLACE THEM ON A MISTER DALY I

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.539 region:rollup2
MOVE THE BILL BUT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:24.308 region:rollup2
A SECOND IT NEVER GOT SO LITTLE

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.710 region:rollup2
MOTION BY MISTER DALY SECOND BY

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.344 region:rollup2
MS LIMON TUCKED AWAY.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:26.978 region:rollup2
I WANT TO THANK YOU OF MISTER

00:42:26.344 --> 00:42:28.312 region:rollup2
CHIEF RING THIS BEFORE WHEN I

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:31.015 region:rollup2
FIRST READ THE BILL I THOUGHT

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:32.316 region:rollup2
WOW WE DON'T DO THIS ALREADY.

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:33.551 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MY RESPONSE WHEN IT WAS

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:34.852 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BECAUSE

00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:37.055 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE DATA WILL BE

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:39.023 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. AND.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:40.792 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT NOT JUST HOW

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:42.326 region:rollup2
CITIES CLICK CLICK DATA BUT HOW

00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:43.728 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO COLLECT DATA. AND THE

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.462 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT ARE JUST WITHIN

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:45.863 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:47.565 region:rollup2
CAN BE CAN BE REALLY

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:48.900 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING TO DO TO TO

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.902 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BUT ALSO.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.336 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF THE I THINK AS YOU

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:54.405 region:rollup2
COLLECT THE DATA AS AS IT IS

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:55.873 region:rollup2
COLLECTED WILL BUILD SEE WHAT OF

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:57.208 region:rollup2
THE DISPARITIES IN AND RURAL

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:58.576 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES VERSUS LARGE URBAN

00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:00.211 region:rollup2
AREAS AND. AND BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:01.846 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ARE DISTINCTIVELY

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:04.148 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THEIR SO.

00:43:01.846 --> 00:43:06.184 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY BELIEVES.

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:07.552 region:rollup2
IN THEIR OWN CITIES THAT THAT IS

00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:08.586 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT

00:43:07.552 --> 00:43:10.054 region:rollup2
THEY FACE AND IDEAS.

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:12.423 region:rollup2
A BUT THE SCALE IS OBVIOUSLY

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:13.858 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT BUT SO I I THINK

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:15.393 region:rollup2
IT'S A GREAT BONE APPRECIATE

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:16.894 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A FORD THINK IF.

00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:18.229 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD A JUST A

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.430 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR.

AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.166 region:rollup2
.

00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:23.701 region:rollup2
MOTIVATION BEHIND THE BILL I

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:25.536 region:rollup2
HAVE A SIMILAR EFFORT IN SAN

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:27.805 region:rollup2
DIEGO WHERE ARE WE SHOOTING OF

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:29.307 region:rollup2
CARE REALLY HAD NOT DONE MUCH ON

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:31.209 region:rollup2
EACH IN MY S..

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:32.810 region:rollup2
AND DOING IT. WAS VERY

00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:33.945 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUTCOMES

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.346 region:rollup2
BASED THING NOW WE CLEARLY HAVE

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:37.215 region:rollup2
CRISIS DOWN THERE SO. THIS IS

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:38.516 region:rollup2
NOW WAY PANACEA BUT YOU CAN'T

00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:39.584 region:rollup2
SOLVE A PROBLEM WITHOUT DIDN'T

00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:41.319 region:rollup2
HELP YOU UNDERSTAND

SO I I GET THE TEMPLATE.

00:43:41.319 --> 00:43:44.322 region:rollup2
MY EXPERIENCE OF THAT LEAVES ME

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.790 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:46.858 region:rollup2
BILL NOT THAT I WILL SUPPORT A

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.058 region:rollup2
ONE VERY CLEAR I'M SUPPORTIVE OF

00:43:46.858 --> 00:43:49.193 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:43:47.058 --> 00:43:50.628 region:rollup2
AT THE MENTION OF THE.

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:51.996 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES.

00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:53.397 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:54.565 region:rollup2
SUSCEPTIBLE TO IDENTITY THEFT.

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:56.133 region:rollup2
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:57.401 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AND YOU

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:59.237 region:rollup2
MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT PRIVACY

00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.771 region:rollup2
I SAW THEM NOTES IN THE REPORT

00:43:59.237 --> 00:44:01.672 region:rollup2
CAN YOU EXPAND UPON THAT HOW CAN

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.874 region:rollup2
WE BE SURE.

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:04.709 region:rollup2
AT THAT THE DATA FOR THAT

00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:05.877 region:rollup2
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS

00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:06.711 region:rollup2
THE DATA FOR THEIR HOME FOR THE

00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:07.745 region:rollup2
VIGIL CONTINUED TO CARE FOR

00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.514 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY THE CUSTODIANS OF

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:10.815 region:rollup2
THIS INFORMATION. BUT IT'S

00:44:09.514 --> 00:44:11.782 region:rollup2
PROTECT IT WILL BE BREACHED

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:13.251 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.651 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE CREATING FOR THEM BY

00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:15.319 region:rollup2
PASSING THIS BILL

00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.721 region:rollup2
SO FOR SMALL THAT IS ACTUALLY

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:18.422 region:rollup2
OUR INTENT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:19.290 region:rollup2
THAT DATE IS NOT PREACHING WE

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:21.125 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:23.394 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST NOTE IN THE

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:24.228 region:rollup2
BILL AYE IT SPECIFICALLY STATES

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:26.731 region:rollup2
THAT THE DATA WAREHOUSE SHALL

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:28.833 region:rollup2
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIDES.

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:30.801 region:rollup2
A HMS STANDARDS AND PROTECTING

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:31.903 region:rollup2
PRIVACY OUGHT TO THAT'S THE

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.738 region:rollup2
STARTING POINT BUT THAT BEING

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:36.073 region:rollup2
SAID WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS AS

00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:37.108 region:rollup2
WE SPEAK WITH ADVOCATES. AYE AND

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:38.376 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COORDINATING COUNCILS

00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:39.677 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE ON WHETHER

00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:41.746 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PRIVACY

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:43.047 region:rollup2
LAYERS THAT WE SHOULD ADD TO

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:44.649 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE FEDERAL STANDARD. A

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:46.417 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:48.019 region:rollup2
ARE FACING IS WE'RE GONNA BE

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:50.354 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR DATA FROM A NUMBER OF

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:51.322 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND TYPES OF

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.590 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND THEY EACH HAVE.

00:44:51.322 --> 00:44:54.292 region:rollup2
PRIVACY STANDARDS.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.426 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO ABIDE

00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:57.862 region:rollup2
BY SO.

00:44:55.426 --> 00:45:00.131 region:rollup2
WE WILL LIKELY BE.

00:44:57.862 --> 00:45:02.200 region:rollup2
LAYERING ON DIFFERENT PRIVACY

00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup2
STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.569 region:rollup2
OF THOSE LAWS ARE IN COMPLIANCE

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:05.803 region:rollup2
WITH WHICH I ABSOLUTE SUPPORTED

00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:07.071 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED.

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:09.173 region:rollup2
AND YOU GOT THE NEXT CONCERN I

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:11.042 region:rollup2
HAVE WHICH IS THE THE DIFFERENCE

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:12.443 region:rollup2
IS THE DATA BETWEEN COUNTIES

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.244 region:rollup2
IMAGINES ONE OF THE VALUES AND.

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.278 region:rollup2
THE KEYS WERE TO THIS MAY BE A

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:15.746 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT.

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:17.515 region:rollup2
ISN'T STANDARDIZING THIS DATA

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:18.916 region:rollup2
ON BUT I I KNOW WHAT WE WERE

00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:20.184 region:rollup2
COLLECTING PREVIOUS TO FINISHED

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:22.053 region:rollup2
IF I HADN'T SAN DIEGO WAS PRETTY

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:23.721 region:rollup2
MINIMAL. ON THE BACK END OF THIS

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:25.056 region:rollup2
IT'S EXTREMELY DETAILED I'M NOT

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:26.557 region:rollup2
JUST PUTTING NOT TRUE COST ALL

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:27.158 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.859 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THIS

00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:31.162 region:rollup2
WRIST ENTERPRISE INFORMATION OR

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:31.762 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ACCEPT THE DATE IN

00:45:31.162 --> 00:45:32.496 region:rollup2
WHATEVER FORM IT COMES FROM.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.431 region:rollup2
TOWN THAT'S ALSO THIS IS PART OF

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.665 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE AROUND DATA I

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:36.667 region:rollup2
THINK PART OF IT IS TO HAVE A

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:38.269 region:rollup2
STANDARD SET OF DATA THAT WE CAN

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:39.704 region:rollup2
COMPARE AND COLLECT FROM LOCAL

00:45:38.269 --> 00:45:41.372 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AS WELL AS FROM STATE

00:45:39.704 --> 00:45:41.973 region:rollup2
AGENCIES BUT. DIFFERENT

00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:43.774 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ARE COLLECTING

00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:44.408 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DEPTHS OF INFORMATION

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:45.876 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA DISCOVER

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:47.445 region:rollup2
OVER TIME WILL START WITH

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.779 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BASIC DATASET AND THEN

00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:49.947 region:rollup2
SEE OVER TIME WHO'S DOING THE

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:51.816 region:rollup2
BEST JOB OF COLLECTING DATA

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:53.284 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOPEFUL AND AND PROBABLY

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:53.951 region:rollup2
ADD TO THE DATABASE.

00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:55.853 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I AM

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:57.221 region:rollup2

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.557 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE.

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:00.958 region:rollup2
SO I HOPE YOU CONTINUE WORK ON

00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.260 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY I'M ON

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.527 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZATION OF DATA YOU KNOW

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.129 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES AND

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:07.064 region:rollup2
ORANGES YOU CAN'T REALLY COME TO

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.898 region:rollup2
RELIABLE CAN KEEP CONCLUSIONS.

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.432 region:rollup2
THAT'S AS IT EASIER SAID THAN

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:10.234 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:11.602 region:rollup2
IT WAS NOT EASY GETTING ALL THE

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:13.204 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO'S ALMOST PROVIDERS TO

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.739 region:rollup2
GET ON THE SAME PAGE FOR.

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:16.107 region:rollup2
DATA COLLECTION TOOL I CAN'T

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:18.009 region:rollup2
IMAGINE WHAT THIS TASK WILL BE

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:18.943 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE BUT I DO THINK THERE'S

00:46:18.009 --> 00:46:21.912 region:rollup2
EXTREME VALUE IN IT.

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:22.813 region:rollup2
PREPS THE THE.

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.014 region:rollup2
LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IS

ABOUT THE COSTS THAT ARE

00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:27.818 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND I

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:29.920 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WOULD ALIGN MYSELF MORE

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:31.455 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH HIM. WITH REGARD TO

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.691 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THIS MAY COST YOU HAVE

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:35.092 region:rollup2
ANY SENSE OF WHAT THIS MAY CAUSE

00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.794 region:rollup2
I IT SAYS UNKNOWN IS A FISCAL

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:38.229 region:rollup2
IMPACT IN THE REPORT YOU MENTION

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:38.796 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SORT OF TRY NATURE ARMS

WHAT WE'RE TALKING EIGHT SEE

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:52.410 region:rollup2
ABOUT COSTS BUT?

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:53.010 region:rollup2

A.

00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:59.417 region:rollup2
A WAREHOUSE AND THEN WE'LL GO

00:46:58.082 --> 00:47:00.685 region:rollup2
TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE NEXT

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2

ANYTHING DATA.

00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:09.493 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I DID ASK A FEW

00:47:07.258 --> 00:47:11.128 region:rollup2
EXPERTS FOR ESTIMATES AND THEIR

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.962 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES WERE I AM. THEY DIDN'T

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.496 region:rollup2
WANT TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:13.698 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.965 region:rollup2
VARIABLES WITH THEIR ESTIMATES

00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:17.435 region:rollup2
WERE ON THE SINGLE THE ONLY

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:18.502 region:rollup2
SINGLE DIGIT MILLIONS NOT IN THE

00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:19.603 region:rollup2
TENS OF MILLIONS.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
WELL GOING BACK TO THE POINT

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:23.374 region:rollup2
THAT HE MADE EARLIER A YOU KNOW

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:25.109 region:rollup2
I WILL CALL ELISE FOR SAN DIEGO

00:47:23.374 --> 00:47:26.811 region:rollup2
IT DID IT WAS A SIMILAR SIZED

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:28.345 region:rollup2
FIGURE FROM ONE COUNTY AND SO I

00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:29.880 region:rollup2
AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT. WILL

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.182 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE STATEWIDE.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.750 region:rollup2
I DON'T NEXT I DON'T THINK

00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:34.118 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REASON NOT TO DO IT

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.752 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE AT SUCH CHOICE

00:47:34.118 --> 00:47:36.787 region:rollup2
POINT THAT'S BEEN BILLIONS ON

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:38.889 region:rollup2
THIS MATTER. ON MY HOPE FOR

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:39.557 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF EFFORTS IS THAT

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.891 region:rollup2
YOU CAN REDUCE DUPLICATION

00:47:39.557 --> 00:47:42.059 region:rollup2
I'M OF SERVICES PROVIDED.

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.527 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY START

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
MEASURING OUTCOMES OF THESE

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:47.031 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN ALL PROGRAMS ARE

00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:48.199 region:rollup2
MIDDLE LIKE ARE AND IT'S NOT ALL

00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:49.133 region:rollup2
OF THEM HAVE GREAT OUTCOMES THAT

00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:50.568 region:rollup2
THIS DATA COULD HELP US TO

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:51.669 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHO THE GOOD ACTORS

00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:53.070 region:rollup2
ARE. AND STEER MORE THESE

00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:54.638 region:rollup2
LIMITED FUNDS TOWARDS THEM AND

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.706 region:rollup2
DE FUND THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.640 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT OUTCOMES ARE NOT

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:58.042 region:rollup2
ALIGNED THEIR PROGRAMMES AT THE

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.009 region:rollup2
POWERS THE STATE. I THINK THAT

00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.811 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE WHERE THE.

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.946 region:rollup2
DELIVERABLE FROM THIS I WOULD

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
NO I THINK WHAT STAFFERS WERE

00:48:01.946 --> 00:48:04.715 region:rollup2
GETTING TOO I THINK THIS THE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:05.916 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE AN

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.284 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN THESE KINDS OF

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.619 region:rollup2
EFFORTS I HOPE THAT WE WOULD.

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:10.654 region:rollup2
AYE MY CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:13.057 region:rollup2
THESE COSTS ARE NOT BORN ON BY

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:13.657 region:rollup2
THE VIGIL CONTINUES OF CARE. AND

00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:14.658 region:rollup2
NONE OF THEM ARE PRETTY GOOD

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:16.026 region:rollup2
WELL FUNDED I SPENT A LOT OF

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.994 region:rollup2
TIME FUND RAISING FOR OUR LOCAL

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:18.763 region:rollup2
EFFORTS AND ANY EFFORT THAT

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:20.431 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

00:48:18.763 --> 00:48:22.199 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BURDENS BOTH COST IN

00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:24.668 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THAT THE.

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:26.403 region:rollup2
I TEAR WHAT NOT WE DON'T STAFF

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:27.838 region:rollup2
TIME WOULD BE OF SOMEWHAT

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:29.373 region:rollup2
CONCERNED I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:31.075 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO CA BARRETT I COULD

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:33.177 region:rollup2
IMAGINE A SMALL COUNTY WOULD BE

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:35.246 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO SO. IF WE CAN KEEP AN

00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:35.813 region:rollup2
EYE ON THAT GOING FORWARD OFFICE

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:37.481 region:rollup2

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:41.552 region:rollup2
INSIGNIFICANT THINGS.

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:43.020 region:rollup2
BUT NOTHING WORTH DOING

00:48:41.552 --> 00:48:45.423 region:rollup2
APPARATUS RIGHT SO.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.124 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR.

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:48.359 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

DOUBLES ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:58.736 region:rollup2

THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMELESS

WE DON'T HAVETHE DATA THAT I

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS A STATE WE SPEND

00:49:33.604 --> 00:49:36.040 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.175 region:rollup2
ON HOMELESSNESS I'LL JUST SAY

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.610 region:rollup2
FOR SAN FRANCISCO. THE LATEST

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:41.479 region:rollup2
COUNT WE SPEND CLOSE TO FOUR

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.479 region:rollup2

BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AND

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.091 region:rollup2
OUR HOPE IS THAT IF ASSUMING THE

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:54.592 region:rollup2
SYSTEM COSTS A FEW MILLION A

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:56.594 region:rollup2
SMALL FRACTION OF THAT.

00:49:54.592 --> 00:49:58.295 region:rollup2

PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HAS

BEEN A PROVEN METHOD OF REDUCING

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:10.928 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND I WOULD SAY OUR

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.597 region:rollup2
IT ALSO HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY

00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:16.333 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING.

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:17.768 region:rollup2
ARE THE COSTS WHEN SOMEONE IS

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:20.237 region:rollup2
NOT HOUSED YEAH THEY'RE

00:52:17.768 --> 00:52:20.804 region:rollup2

OTHERS.

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:27.978 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HEARD FROM ORGANIZATIONS

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.779 region:rollup2

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:31.248 region:rollup2

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:33.283 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LOCAL APPROVAL

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:34.852 region:rollup2
PROCESS

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:36.887 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:38.355 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STREAMLINE

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:55.706 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE

QUANTIFIABLE DESIGN STANDARDS

00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.644 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT UNDER

00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:02.346 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:02.846 region:rollup2

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:15.059 region:rollup2
THAT PREMISE

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:16.360 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:19.096 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS FROM BEING STALLED

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.930 region:rollup2

THE FEDERAL COURTS.

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:51.528 region:rollup2

COST OF SERVICES FOR THE

TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DATA

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:41.431 region:rollup2

THINK YOU SUPPORTED IT AB

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:50.019 region:rollup2
SEVENTY THREE WHICH WOULD

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:52.489 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH INCENTIVES

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:54.224 region:rollup2
FOR THE STREAMLINING OF PROJECTS

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:56.326 region:rollup2

AFFORDABILITY SO WE'VE HAD THIS

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.896 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THIS PARTICULAR

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:01.331 region:rollup2

PERMITS PORT OF HOUSING BECAUSE

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:04.033 region:rollup2
THERE HAD BEEN. MIGHT MANY MORE

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.668 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR REASONS WHY THESE

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.470 region:rollup2
SORTS PROJECTS ARE ARE BEING

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.538 region:rollup2

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:11.841 region:rollup2
LIKE OTHERS AND.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:12.409 region:rollup2
THINK THE LAST THING I WILL SAY

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:14.244 region:rollup2
IS.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:15.445 region:rollup2
A YOU'D REFERENCE EARLIER THE

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.813 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE DOLLARS THAT

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:19.616 region:rollup2
WE SPENT BEING SPENT.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:21.418 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER.

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:28.024 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SOURCE.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:29.993 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS AND YET THEY HAVE TO

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:31.461 region:rollup2
SPEND YEARS DEALING WITH THE

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:33.596 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS IN THE

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:35.098 region:rollup2
APPROVAL PROCESS. AND THE POINT

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:37.200 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL IS TO SPEED UP THE

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:38.234 region:rollup2

OF HOUSING.

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:41.838 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS SO THAT RATHER THAN

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.573 region:rollup2
THE MONEY GOING INTO THE PROCESS

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:45.542 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY GOES INTO.

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:46.409 region:rollup2

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:36.759 region:rollup2

THAT VERY QUESTION AND I THINK

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.105 region:rollup2
WE WERE ABLE TO GET.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.406 region:rollup2
SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT BILLS

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:52.475 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT ARE BEING

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:54.244 region:rollup2

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S GENERAL PLANS

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:13.022 region:rollup2
THAT CITIES MUST.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:14.424 region:rollup2
ABIDE BY THEIR LOCAL ZONING.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:17.393 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:19.228 region:rollup2
.

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:21.597 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SIMPLY.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:24.867 region:rollup2
GIVES THE CITY ADDITIONAL TOOLS

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:26.235 region:rollup2
TO PROCESS PROJECTS WHICH COMPLY

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.670 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL ZONING SO THAT'S VERY

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:30.540 region:rollup2
KEY.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:31.941 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO STATE. OVERRIDE HERE.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.644 region:rollup2
.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:36.946 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ZONING.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:38.915 region:rollup2
SO IF THE ZONING FITS

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:42.452 region:rollup2
THEN THE PROJECT.

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:45.455 region:rollup2
IS CONSIDERED WORTHY.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:46.956 region:rollup2
SO I'LL HOW. HOW WERE YOU THAT

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.857 region:rollup2
IN EVERY CITIES DIFFERENT ARENA

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.692 region:rollup2
CITY OF A CITY LIKE?

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.794 region:rollup2
Y. DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE YEAH

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:53.196 region:rollup2
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE A FRANKLY

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:55.098 region:rollup2
APPROACH OF THESE TYPES OF

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:57.300 region:rollup2
PROJECTS PROBABLY. A WOULD BE

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:59.535 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY IN THE CITY LIKE IRVINE

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.738 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERY SQUARE INCH HAS BEEN

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.938 region:rollup2
MASTER PLANNED AND ZONED.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.172 region:rollup2
AND.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.807 region:rollup2
AND THEIR.

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:08.111 region:rollup2
IS BASICALLY.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:09.579 region:rollup2
NO. ONE MAJOR A DEVELOPER IN

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:11.047 region:rollup2
TOWN.

01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:12.949 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THIS BILL FITS

01:09:11.047 --> 01:09:16.219 region:rollup2
OLDER COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE

01:09:12.949 --> 01:09:19.422 region:rollup2
ARE OLD SAY ROADSIDE MOTELS.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS OLD

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:23.059 region:rollup2
AND.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:24.594 region:rollup2
AND THE IN SOME CASES THOSE ARE.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.262 region:rollup2
ARE NOW A HOUSING FOR

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.130 region:rollup2
TRANSIENTS

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
OR OR.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:32.635 region:rollup2
MAYBE A PROBLEMATIC PROJECTS IN

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:34.637 region:rollup2
THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.172 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TOM.

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:37.707 region:rollup2
THAT FITS AT TIMES A LITTLE BIT

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.941 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.309 region:rollup2
AND SO IF IT'S ZONED FOR

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.644 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.212 region:rollup2
THEN A PROJECT LIKE THIS.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:45.782 region:rollup2
.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.616 region:rollup2
WELL QUALIFIED.

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.817 region:rollup2
BUT THE CITY STILL HAS TO BE

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:49.619 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE I THINK THAT.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.421 region:rollup2
THE MAIN.

01:09:49.619 --> 01:09:53.389 region:rollup2
ANSWER HERE SIR IS THAT.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.624 region:rollup2
.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
I'M A CITY HAS TO BE COMFORTABLE

01:09:54.624 --> 01:10:00.063 region:rollup2
WITH PROJECTS LIKE THIS.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:02.131 region:rollup2

AND THE NORTH THAT'S NOT THE

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:54.383 region:rollup2

ABOUT.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.738 region:rollup2
YEAH I IN MY OPINION THEY'RE

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:18.241 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS FOR

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:20.143 region:rollup2
CITIES IN THIS BILL.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
IF I COULD JUST AS PART OF A

HOUSING AND ON THE OTHER HAND

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.784 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.719 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.420 region:rollup2
THAT HOUSING HAS I WOULD SUBMIT

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.722 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.457 region:rollup2
THAT OFTENTIMES LOCAL

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:36.793 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ARE ADDING ALL

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:37.727 region:rollup2
SORTS OF OWNERS CONDITIONS ONTO

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:40.263 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS OF THAT THEY

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.597 region:rollup2
DON'T GET BILLED SO. I THINK THE

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:44.066 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:45.301 region:rollup2
ARE WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:47.236 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT IF

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.805 region:rollup2
THEY MEET THE ZONING ARE IN

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:50.139 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL AREAS THEY SHOULD BE

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.207 region:rollup2
ENCUMBERED WITH ADDITIONAL

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:53.943 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THAT WOULD SLOW IT

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:55.478 region:rollup2
DOWN. OR OTHERWISE ADD YEARS FOR

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.679 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS TO GET BUILT SO

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.446 region:rollup2
UP SO TO.

MIGHT MY JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:02.018 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.653 region:rollup2
LOCALS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.687 region:rollup2
DICTATE WHAT THEIR ZONING RULES

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:06.923 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:08.257 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE ALSO SAYING TO A

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:10.092 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:12.395 region:rollup2

TO SLOW DOWN.

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:01.410 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A MILLION ONE

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.512 region:rollup2
REASONS TO SLOW WALK OR TO TRY

SERVICES HAVE TO BE PROVIDED TO

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:59.602 region:rollup2
THE TENANTS IN THE PROJECT IT

01:13:56.732 --> 01:14:00.970 region:rollup2
DOES NOT LIMIT THE SERVICES TO.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.405 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIVING THERE SO FOR

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:04.573 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SOME SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:05.508 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS BUILD OUR COMMUNITY

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.743 region:rollup2
HEALTH CLINICS ON THE FIRST

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:09.445 region:rollup2
FLOOR. THOSE WOULD NOT BE

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:11.280 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO JUST THE RESIDENTS

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:12.815 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL I THINK MOST OF

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.283 region:rollup2
THE TIME SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.584 region:rollup2
JUST PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.852 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.787 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SOME OCCASIONS

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.055 region:rollup2
WERE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:21.223 region:rollup2
PROVIDING

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.791 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED CLINICAL CARE TO

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:23.092 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AS

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:25.394 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:26.729 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE RIGHT NOW IN

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.563 region:rollup2
GUY LIKE ME AND YOUNG OR MY PETS

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:30.299 region:rollup2
BUT IT ON THE STAFF.

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:31.033 region:rollup2
I'M ALL IN FAVOR RIGHT BUT I DO

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.435 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WHEN YOU START

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:34.036 region:rollup2
INVITING FOLKS MY OUTSIDE OF THE

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:35.338 region:rollup2
COMPLEX THE RESIDENTS OF THAT

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:37.406 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THE NEIGHBORS.

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:38.607 region:rollup2
THEN THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:40.343 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT RIGHT IF YOU'RE

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:41.610 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ANY SORT OF ONSITE

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.945 region:rollup2
FEEDING PROGRAMS

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:45.047 region:rollup2
BUT I AM NOT HEALTH CLINIC RIGHT

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.848 region:rollup2
IT'S WHEN THEY DIVIDE SERVICES

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.582 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOLKS ARE THERE. IN USE

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.984 region:rollup2
NOTHING MISTER DALY MISTER

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:49.218 region:rollup2
CHOOSE POINT IF YOU'RE TELLING

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:51.554 region:rollup2
AS A MARKET RATE FOR THE HOUSE

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:53.222 region:rollup2
OF MARKET RATE HOUSING PROJECT

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.824 region:rollup2
THE ONSITE SERVICES ARE THE GEM

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.958 region:rollup2
OF FOR THE RESIDENTS OR THE FIRE

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:57.460 region:rollup2
PIT FOR THE RESIDENTS OR

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.060 region:rollup2
WHATEVER. NO CONDITIONAL USE

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.929 region:rollup2
PERMITS OR.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.330 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU START PROVIDE

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.898 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHICH IS THE SAME THING

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.899 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO BE DONE POPULATIONS OF

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.835 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE IS DIFFERENT BUT

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:07.370 region:rollup2
ALSO WE START BUTTON. RULES IN

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:10.272 region:rollup2
AGAINST SLOWING DOWN THE PROCESS

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:11.073 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT BECOMES AN UNTENABLE

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.175 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.776 region:rollup2
SOLVE. I THINK WHAT HAPPENS AND

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.878 region:rollup2
WHERE WE START TO LOSE PUBLIC

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:17.613 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IS IF THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:19.448 region:rollup2
BUILT IN THERE'S QUEUING OUTSIDE

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.982 region:rollup2
OF THE BUILDING RIGHT FOLKS

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.916 region:rollup2
LINED UP FOR LUNCH OR FOR

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:22.518 region:rollup2
DINNER.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:24.153 region:rollup2
IF YOU SEEN YOU KNOW.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.187 region:rollup2
AFFAIR NOT HEAVY TRAFFIC THESE

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.689 region:rollup2
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
TEND TO I THINK ABOUT THE PUBLIC

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:30.059 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND TRUST THE I GET A

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.593 region:rollup2
SENSE OF PEOPLE MORE OPEN TO

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.560 region:rollup2
THIS COULD SEE HOW BAD THE

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:33.429 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ARE. AND SOMEONE

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.130 region:rollup2
UNDERMINE THAT AND I'VE BEEN

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:36.265 region:rollup2
ABLE TO USE THAT WHEN I WAS A C.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.400 region:rollup2
COUNCIL MEMBER TO GET I THINK

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:38.634 region:rollup2
WERE THE CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.336 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY LIMIT THAT AND

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.570 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A LEVEL OF CERTAINTY. I

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:44.640 region:rollup2
THINK THE THREE EXAMPLES IN MY

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:45.941 region:rollup2
TIME IN THE CITY COUNCIL AYE WE

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.943 region:rollup2
STAB US AS A PART OF MITCHELL

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:49.278 region:rollup2
USE PERMIT PROCESS AYE

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:53.082 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:54.984 region:rollup2
OUT COMMITTEE I DID THAT MONTH

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:56.419 region:rollup2
OF MONTHLY TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.753 region:rollup2
PROJECT RIGHT. IN EACH OF THOSE

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:59.789 region:rollup2
INSTANCES THOSE COMMITTEES

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:01.757 region:rollup2
DISBANDED AFTER A SHORT AMOUNT

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:05.161 region:rollup2
TIME BECAUSE THE CONCERNS OF

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:06.429 region:rollup2
THEY HAD IN DEMAND IN THE CP. I

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.998 region:rollup2
WERE NOT THOSE THOSE CONCERNS

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:11.667 region:rollup2
NEVER CAME TO FRUITION. POINT IS

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:14.103 region:rollup2
THEY GOT I GOT TO THE POINT FOR

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:15.738 region:rollup2
THE APPROVAL NOW THE BILL IS

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:17.239 region:rollup2
KIND OF INTO THE DISTORTION GO

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:19.375 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT AND NOT HAVE THAT

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:21.544 region:rollup2
BUT. I QUESTION WHETHER NOT THE

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:24.113 region:rollup2
WISDOM THERE'S WISDOM BEHIND

01:16:21.544 --> 01:16:25.047 region:rollup2
DOING THAT AND IN AND TAKING

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:27.216 region:rollup2
AWAY.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:31.187 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SAFETIES.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:33.756 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT ARE THERE. FOR

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:35.257 region:rollup2
OFF SITE SERVICES AGAIN I THINK

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS LIKE FOR

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:39.128 region:rollup2
LIKE MULTI FAMILY MULTI FAMILY

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:42.231 region:rollup2
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING OF

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:43.666 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC WRONG OF THE PEOPLE WHO

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:44.266 region:rollup2
ARE SERVING THEIR.

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:55.110 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S PROBABLY FIND WHAT

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:58.581 region:rollup2
HELP PLAN THE PROJECTS.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:59.949 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS LIMIT SOME FEATURES

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:00.850 region:rollup2
IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:03.085 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:04.720 region:rollup2
CITY'S FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.055 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE OTHER PROJECTS.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.257 region:rollup2
IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:09.925 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE WON'T WHERE THE CITY

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.893 region:rollup2
WON'T BE A FINANCIAL PARTNER.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.194 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROJECTS I'M FAMILIAR

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.429 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:15.097 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT LEVEL OF CITY

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:16.098 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT.

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:17.733 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:19.502 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S APPROPRIATE.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.469 region:rollup2
MY VIEW THEIR APPROPRIATE

01:17:19.502 --> 01:17:22.104 region:rollup2
CONTROLS YOUR POINT IS WELL

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.939 region:rollup2
TAKEN.

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:25.641 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S A PROJECT BY

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:27.610 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.745 region:rollup2
THE DECISION.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:31.080 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE SMALLER PROJECTS

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:34.083 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE LARGER PROJECTS IT

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.017 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON THE ACREAGE.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:37.119 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU KNOW OLDER

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:38.387 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT LAND

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:40.489 region:rollup2
USE HISTORIES.

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2
.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:44.260 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:45.094 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S WITH THIS REALLY

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.630 region:rollup2
NOT A COOKIE CUTTER OF.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:48.163 region:rollup2
.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.266 region:rollup2
.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:51.800 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:53.836 region:rollup2
SO WERE I THINK

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.571 region:rollup2
ALSO I THINK BECAUSE THE CRISIS

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:57.172 region:rollup2
WERE IN WE HAVE TO TRY. VARIOUS

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:59.175 region:rollup2
TOOLS.

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:00.176 region:rollup2
AND MECHANISMS AND WE CAN ALWAYS

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.511 region:rollup2
REVISIT THOSE.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.612 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD SOME PUSH BACK IN MY

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.915 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OVER THE CONCEPT OF

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:08.384 region:rollup2
GRANNY UNITS.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:10.986 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:13.088 region:rollup2
ON PERMITTED GRAINY UNITS GOING

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:14.390 region:rollup2
BACK SEVENTY FIVE YEARS.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.324 region:rollup2
WELL THE REALITY IS THERE ARE

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.392 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MANY

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:18.127 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS TO BUILD THOSE NEW

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:19.962 region:rollup2
PERMITS.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:21.764 region:rollup2
AND THE CITIES DO HAVE THE EVEN

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:23.866 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE'VE.

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:25.868 region:rollup2
ENABLED IN CONCEPT MORE BRANDY

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:26.669 region:rollup2
UNITS A CITY STILL HAVE QUITE A

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.504 region:rollup2
BIT OF OF CONTROL.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:30.472 region:rollup2
.

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:32.041 region:rollup2
AND SO THE REALITIES SOMETIMES

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:34.276 region:rollup2
THE FEARS DON'T MATCH THE

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:36.378 region:rollup2
REALITY SO AND THOSE SO THAT'S

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:37.780 region:rollup2
MY HOPE WITH THIS BILL.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
AND THAT WHILE YOU WERE ASKING

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.416 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I JUST SKIMMED THE

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.784 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION TO TO LOOK AT

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:44.553 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICE

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:46.155 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS AND. I ALWAYS SAY IN

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.122 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS THAT THERE SHALL BE

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:50.125 region:rollup2
A MINIMUM.

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:51.694 region:rollup2
EITHER NUMBER SQUARE FEET OF

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:53.195 region:rollup2
NINETY SQUARE FEET FOR A

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:55.064 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS OF TWENTY OR FEWER

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:56.298 region:rollup2
UNITS FOR ON SITE SUPPORTIVE OR

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.967 region:rollup2
FOR DEVELOPMENTS WITH MORE THAN

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:59.535 region:rollup2
TWENTY UNITS AT LEAST THREE

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:00.636 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE. A NON RESIDENT

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
FLOOR AREA TO BE PRESENTED TO

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:03.572 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SO THAT THIS IS THE

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.473 region:rollup2
FIRST CONVERSATION HAVING WITH A

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.040 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ABOUT THIS TOPIC I'M

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.442 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.109 region:rollup2

AND.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.446 region:rollup2
AND HAPPY TO ALSO GET SPONSORS

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:11.981 region:rollup2

I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN AGAIN

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:15.417 region:rollup2
I'M ON BILL I MAKE THE MOTION

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.920 region:rollup2
I'M

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:19.088 region:rollup2
I THINK IT DOES SOLVE A A REAL

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.622 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE SEE. ACROSS

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:22.558 region:rollup2
BUT IN THAT THROUGH IN THE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:24.293 region:rollup2
PASSAGE I THINK YOUR FRIEND TO

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:25.294 region:rollup2
ON PAGE TWO OF THE STAFF REPORT.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.730 region:rollup2
AYE THE MENTION OF COMMUNITY
