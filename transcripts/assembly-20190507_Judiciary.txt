AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF FROM EL SALVADOR UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND NECESSITY FOR TPS FIRST HAND. SINCE ITS ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE DREAM ACT AIMS TO PROVIDE A MULTI PHASE MULTI PHASE PROCESS FOR QUALIFYING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT YOUTH TO SEEK RESIDENCY AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. OVER THE YEARS THE DREAM ACT HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY DEBATED HOWEVER CONGRESS HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO TAKE ACTION FOR THAT REASON. I AM HONORED TO JOIN THE EFFORTS OF CONGRESSWOMAN LUCILLE ROYBAL ALLARD WHO IS MY CONGRESSWOMAN AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. FIFTY ONE IN SUPPORTING THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE DREAM ACT AND THEN ENSURING A TRUE PATHWAY FOR CITIZEN YOUTH IN OUR NATION.

ARE AS THE SOME THE ONE MENTIONED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE DREAM ACT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS YET THEY HAVE FAILED TO PASS ANY SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION. ARE THOSE VERSIONS ARE IN THEIR HOUSE ARE IN THE SENATE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE RECENT ACTIONS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RESEND PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE CONDITIONAL STATUS TO IMMIGRANTS -- LÃ  OF OUR ARMED THERE'S TWO OF IMMIGRANTS HERE CALIFORNIA FACE TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTIES CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PERMANENT SOLUTION. IF CONGRESS WAS TO ACT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL EVERY YEAR FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. I WILL -- FIRST OFF. SEVEN THE COURT CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAO. CHIU AND SALAS [inaudible] HOLDEN KALRA [inaudible] KILEY [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] NORRIS [inaudible] REYES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM RIGHT ON THIS RESOLUTION QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEC THE SERVER NOTHING I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK YOU RAISE SOME EXCELLENT POINTS IN THIS RESOLUTION AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE. IN NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT I DO THINK IT'S AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION TO SAY THAT CONGRESS IS UNWILLING TO ACT I MEAN I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE. DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL DIVIDES AND DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THAT SITUATION. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY CLEAR AT I HOPE EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND YOU TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE WARY OF RESOLUTIONS THAT. CALL ON CONGRESS TO DO THIS -- URGED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CONGRESS PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH AND WHEN WE WANT TO URGE CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING WE PICK UP THE PHONE AND WE TALKED TO THEM. SO BY DEFINITION OF WE PASSED A RESOLUTION IT'S NOT URGING CONGRESS IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A POLITICAL STATEMENT IT'S NOT A A SOMETHING THAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LEGITIMATE LEGISLATIVE TOOL. FOR US SO I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE WARY OF THAT -- IN AND JUST SAY ONE MORE THING -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK COULD BE A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND I I'D LIKE TO URGE YOU IS THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD CONSIDER MAYBE -- FINE TUNING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IF WE DID IT IN A WAY THAT CALLS ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. AND NOT A WAY THAT CRITICIZES THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT COULD BE BIPARTISAN BUT IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO VOTE [inaudible] FOR THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS I'LL TAKE A MOTION THE MOTION IS THAT THIS RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED AS AMENDED. HE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WAS KAYLA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I THINK IT IS A VERY LEGITIMATE IN FACT THE NECESSARY FUNDS OF THIS BODY. TO DRAFT RESOLUTIONS AND MAKE REQUESTS AS AS AN OFFICIAL LEGISLATURE OF CONGRESS OF THE PRESIDENT OF ANY OTHER BODY WE COULD EVEN BE ASKING OTHER STATES TO JOIN US WITH THIS IS THAT IT'S NOT AN INDIVIDUAL REQUEST IT IS IN FACT A REQUEST OF THE BODY. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS USEFUL IN FACT POWERFUL. AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO ADDRESS MR OBERNOLTE IS POINT BUT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN THE DREAM ACT WAS INJURED FIRST INTRODUCED IT ACTS THE HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND THEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND TRAGIC HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT WAS. NINE ELEVEN AND IT COSTS THIS THE DREAM ACT ACTUALLY BE PUT ON HOLD AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE SINCE NINE ELEVEN THIS HAS CONTINUED TO BE AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN UNRESOLVED. BOTH OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SIDE. BUT IT'S ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED AND TO YOUR POINT WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM LOOKS LIKE. BOTH FOR UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH PARENTS OF UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH. TPS RECIPIENTS A SILENT RECIPIENTS REFUGEES WE ARE NOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ACCEPTING LAST REFUGEES DUE. TO FEDERAL. REGULATIONS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SEEKING ASYLUM IN. IN OUR IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY NOT ONLY ON THE BORDERS BUT FROM WARS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND SO I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO FIND A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM SOLUTION THAT IS BIPARTISAN. THAT SPEAKS TO THE VALUES AND MORALS OF THIS NATION AND WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THAT THIS.
