PLANS.

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.181
IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:33.083
CONVENE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER.

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.452

AND THEN OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:06.683
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROGRAM

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.853

IT IS KNOWN THAT MAY HAVE THEIR

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.865
POWER TURNED OFF -- HAVING LOCAL

DISASTERS -- THAT WE KNOW -- WE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:21.184
NEED -- ONE KEY THING TO

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.418
REMEMBER IS THAT.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:23.353
AT A WE ASK WHICH IS UNIQUE IS

ALMOST A SELF LOOKING ICE CAN GO

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.280
WE CAN.

THAT AND THAT THIS A SECOND

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:04.093
PRONG -- THIS PART OF THIS FIRST --

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.461
BUCK AND AT IN OTHER WORDS WOULD

THE SECOND.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.469
PRONG OR BUCKET IS -- WHAT WE

CALL MISSION TASKING -- FUND

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.707
APPROPRIATION THIS IS A NEW

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.709
PROGRAM -- MANY TIMES WE ARE

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.477
MISSION TASKING OTHER STATE

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.946

PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOVERY --

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.353
THESE THESE AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.021
GENERALLY FUNDED FOR THAT.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:35.591
AND IT'S A CONTINUAL CHALLENGE --

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.760
TO BE ABLE TO GET RESOURCES AND

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:39.695
AGENCIES COMMITTED OVER A PERIOD

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.831
OF TIME -- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:43.800
BACK FOR DEFICIENCIES OR OTHER

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.902
KINDS OF ASPECTS IN THIS IN

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.437
ESSENCE IS A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:50.039
INCLUDE TWENTY MILLION. TO GOING

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:52.375
TO A OF A FIND -- THAT WOULD

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.477
FIND STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE

TO IMMEDIATELY GIVEN THAT FRONT

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.549
LOADED TO FIND DEAN -- SO

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:00.483
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF HOW

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.318
THEY GONNA PAY AND PUT THEIR

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:10.193
BUDGETS IN A CRISIS SITUATION --

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.961
END UP PART OF ADDING INCLUDES --

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:13.196
UP SOME POSITIONS PROPOSITIONS

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:13.830
TO ADMINISTER THAT FINE AND AND

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.232
TRACK THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.901
THIS ALSO -- TRACKS THE AMOUNT

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:21.304
OF RECOVERY DOLLARS THAT WE GET

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.940
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.042
FOR DISASTER RESPONSE AND IN

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.544
ESSENCE THIS AT THIS INITIATIVE

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.912
REALLY WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF BY

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:33.516
HAVING VERY -- CLEAR --

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.218
AFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAYS OF

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.420
BEING ABLE -- TO RAPIDLY GET OUR

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.888
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT BACK WE

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.256
WANT TO MAXIMIZE WAS FEDERAL

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.291
REIMBURSE BACK PARTICULARLY IN

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.259
CURRENT.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.594
POLITICAL CLIMATE IS VERY

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.330
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ALL OF

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.831
OUR RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY --

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.134
IN LINE -- TO MAXIMIZE OUR

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.635
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.670
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE OF THAT --

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.038
IS A CONTINUITY AND SEARCH

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.307
CAPACITY THIS IS REALLY -- AN

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:02.178
INTERESTING -- IDEA TO BE ABLE

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.747
TO BUILD IN ESSENCE A STATEWIDE

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.449
DISASTER RESERVE CORPS.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:08.351
THIS IS REALLY AN INVESTMENT --

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:12.321
ON THE FRONT END -- TO BUILD --

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:15.391
INDIVIDUALS RETIREES -- FROM

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.960
LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL OR

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.495
PRIVATE SECTOR THEY WANT TO

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:22.231
BECOME A RESERVIST WITH US THAT

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.833
HAVE A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE THAT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.234
WE COULD BRING TO THE TABLE AND

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.503
USED DURING AN EMERGENCY -- AND

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.005
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO BUILD

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:31.007
THAT RESERVE CORPS AND PROVIDE

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:31.641
SOME TRAINING FOR THOSE

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.476
INDIVIDUALS AND WE WOULD ONLY

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.178
CALL THEM WHEN NEEDED.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.779
AND WE WOULD EMPLOY THEM TO

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.981
SUPPORT -- I WAS IN A MAJOR

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.416
DISASTER AND IT WOULD REALLY BY

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.752
DOWN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.086
HAVE TO GO OUT AND BRING IN.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.489
PRE VET CONTRACTS AND TRY TO

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:47.857
TRACKDOWN AND BUILD UP

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.126
RESOURCES SO -- THIS IS REALLY A

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:52.094
A PROGRAM MODELED AFTER THE

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.963
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND FEMALE

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:54.797
WHERE THEY'VE GOT A DISASTER

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.699
RESERVE -- PROGRAM AND IT'S BEEN

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.168
A VERY SUCCESSFUL -- IN COST

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.337
EFFECTIVE IN BEING ABLE -- TO

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.172
MANAGE THAT PROGRAM SO THAT IS

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:05.408
IN ESSENCE THE SECOND -- REQUEST

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:06.542
THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.478
SOUNDS GOOD OKAY ANY COMMENTS

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:10.947
FROM L. FROM FINANCE.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:11.881
MANAGER STEVE EVENTS WITH THE

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:12.515
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:13.983
TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.885
PART OF A LARGER ADMINISTRATION

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.887
STATEWIDE PACKAGE THE THAT FIRST

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.722
PRONG THAT THE DIRECTOR SPOKE

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.257
ABOUT WITH THE CAN BASS LINE.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.925
INCREASES IN RESOURCES AFFECTS

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.227
EIGHT DEPARTMENTS IT WAS KIND OF

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.328
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT AND

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.296
TARGETED WAYS TO TRY AND LIFT

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.531
THE THE RAISE THE BOAT IF YOU

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:29.899
WILL.

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.234
ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF OUR

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.535
PREPAREDNESS TO RESPOND THESE

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.869
EMERGENCIES AND SO IT'S KIND OF

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:39.742
REAL INTERCALL AND HOW THESE ALL

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.110
WORK TOGETHER [inaudible]

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.445
HELLO.

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.112
AS WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS AS WAS

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:43.746
NOTED THERE ARE THREE SEPARATE

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:44.914
COMPONENTS OF THIS -- REQUEST

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:45.414
ALL GO THROUGH THEM --

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.249
SEQUENTIALLY THE FIRST BEING

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.083
THAT -- YES STAFF RESOURCES --

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.452
WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN MANY CASES

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.287
OTHER QUEST SO CONCLUDES

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:54.323
BASICALLY BROAD -- AUGMENTATIONS

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.325
ACROSS A VARIETY OF P. PARTS OF

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.793
THE DEPARTMENT THAT INCLUDES

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.228
THINGS LIKE YOUR CYBERSECURITY

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.730
INTEGRATION CENTER AS WELL AS

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:01.998
THEIR PLANNING ACTIVITIES AS

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:04.100
WELL AS THEIR RESPONSE TRACKING

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.369
AT HR AND YEAH IT'S JUST IT'S

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.837
VERY BROAD ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT.

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.472
AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN MANY

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.040
CASES THEIR QUEST PROVIDES A

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.508
BROAD DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.976
TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT SECTION

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.378
DOES OR MAYBE EVEN THOSE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.713
POSITIONS -- BUT IT'S OFTEN

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.082
UNCLEAR SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.717
CURRENT LEVEL OF SAID STAFFING

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.052
IS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES WHAT THE

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.721
SPECIFIC GAPS ARE AS WELL AS WHY

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.024
THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PERSONNEL

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.525
ARE REQUESTED AND SO.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.093
AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.962
THERE'S A LACK OF OF SORT OF

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.197
THAT DETAILED INFORMATION THAT

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:35.831
WE WOULD WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:36.565
TO SEE.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.967
ACCORDINGLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:39.135
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SEEK THIS

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.970
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- IF THE

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:41.904
DEPARTMENT ISN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.307
IT -- IN TIME FOR THIS BUDGET WE

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.207
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.276
CONSIDER REJECTING ON THEIR

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.645
QUEST IN WHOLE OR IN PART OR

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.614
COULD ALSO AS POTENTIALLY

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.215
APPROVED A NEW POSITIONS ON A

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.417
LIMITED TERM BASIS AND THAT

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.551
WOULD NOT HAVE THEM COME BACK

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.086
AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.421
DETAIL AT THAT POINT -- WITH

01:05:58.487 --> 01:05:59.555
REGARD TO THE SECOND PIECE THE

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.956
MISSION TASKING THAT THAT TWENTY

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.792
MILLION DOLLAR FUND AS WELL AS

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.126
THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:06.095
DOLLARS FOR THE TWELVE POSITIONS

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.930
TO ADMINISTER THAT -- WE KNOW

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.965
THAT THE CONCEPT OF ESTABLISHING

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.467
SUCH A FIND -- IS CERTAINLY A

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.303
PROMISING ONE HOWEVER AGAIN --

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.671
IT'S INCLUDE US EXACTLY HOW THAT --

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.206
BUT THE BASIS IS FOR THAT

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.608
FUNDING AMOUNT AND AND IN TERMS

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.777
OF THE THE STOP LEVEL OF STAFF

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.145
RESOURCES IT'S UNCLEAR TO US --

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:25.448
WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT LEVEL --

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.782
PARTICULARLY WOULD NOTE THAT --

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:27.950
THAT FINDINGS REQUESTED FOR

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.785
THOSE POSITIONS ON AN ONGOING

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.420
BASIS -- WELL THE FIND WOULD

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.788
ONLY BE SPENT OVER THE NEXT

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.557
ROUGHLY THREE YEARS AND SO ON

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:35.925
THERE'S ALSO SOME QUESTION ABOUT

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:42.098
WHETHER ON GOING FUNDING IS

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:43.366
APPROPRIATE AND CASE.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.266
ACCORDINGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.167
LEGISLATURE SEEK ADDITIONAL

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:46.502
DETAILS ON ON THE STAFF LEVEL

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.336
AND IT CERTAINLY IF THE

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:47.937
LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT THE

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.405
GENERAL CONCEPT OF THIS FIND

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.906
MAKES SENSE WE RECOMMEND -- THE

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.308
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER CONSIDER --

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:54.910
IMPLEMENTING AS A PILOT PROJECT --

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.712
SO IT COULD FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:57.947
THE FUNDING ON A FOR THE

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.181
POSITIONS ON A LIMITED TERM

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:01.817

WITH IT AND AND HOW IT'S WORKING.

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:16.899
WE THINK THAT'LL IMPROVE

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.067
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENSURE

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.168
THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND

SIR BUT IT'S FUNDING AND WHAT

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.405
THE OUTCOMES ARE -- AND THEN

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.140
WITH REGARD TO THE THIRD PIECE

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:27.109
THAT WAS THAT I SAID ROUGHLY

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:27.710
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SIX

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.145
POSITIONS FOR THAT.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.013
A DISASTER RESERVE CORPS --

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.014
REALLY THESE FOLKS AS WE

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.282
UNDERSTAND IT ARE GONNA BE DOING

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.251
THE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY HOW

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.786
THIS WOULD BE DONE SO THEY

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.788
THEY'LL BE KIND OF TRYING TO

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.723
FIGURE OUT HOW THIS NEW PROGRAM

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.459
WOULD BE RYAN -- AGAIN WE THINK

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.127

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:45.895
QUITE A BIT OF PROMISE BUT

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.963
THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF DETAIL

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.431

ACCORDINGLY -- SIMILAR TO THAT

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.700
THE PREVIOUS COMPONENTS BE

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:52.902
SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.570
SEEK THESE ADDITIONAL DETAILS --

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:57.039
IF THAT ISN'T AVAILABLE -- BUT

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.107
AGAIN IF THE LEGISLATURE THINK

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.642
THAT THIS IS A CONCEPT WORTH

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.343

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:14.723

I JUST AS A REMINDER THE

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.022
JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.458
BIENNIAL REPORT THAT ARE A

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.060
JUDICIAL BRANCH PRODUCES THAT

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.628
SHOWS THE NEED FOR JUDGESHIPS

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.096
BASED ON WORKLOAD.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.265
THE JUDGE MODEL HAS THREE BASIC

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:25.434
COMPONENTS ONE IS THAT IT IS

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.503
BASED ON A THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.304
FILENE'S AND WE MEASURE FILINGS

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.939
IN DIFFERENT CASE TYPES.

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:33.609
OF FAMILY LAW CIVIL AND CRIMINAL.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.477
A IT IS ALSO BASED ON WORKLOAD

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.312
STANDARDS ALSO CALLED CASE

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:38.680
WEIGHTS THAT MEASURE THE FULL

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.415
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CASES OF

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.017
VARIOUS STATE TYPES TAKE.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.552
FROM FILING THROUGH DISPOSITION

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.220
AND INCLUDING ANY POST

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.588
DISPOSITION ACTIVITY.

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:47.923
AND FINALLY THE THIRD COMPONENT

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.758
OF THE MODEL IS A PRIORITIZATION

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:50.659
METHOD.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.428
THAT DETERMINES IN WHAT ORDER

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.364
JUDGES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED.

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.698
IN IT REFLECTS COUNCIL

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.534
PRIORITIES -- OVER THE LAST

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.669
DECADE AS WELL AS IT IS CODIFIED

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:05.974
IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION.

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:06.542
SIX NINE SIX ONE FOUR AT THE

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.444
COUNCIL PRIORITIES. FOR JUDICIAL

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.046
ALLOCATION ARE BASICALLY TO

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.248
CONSIDER COURTS WITH THE

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.516
GREATEST WORKLOAD NEED.

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.119
BUT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO COURTS

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:20.022
FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF USERS.

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:21.056
I TO KEEP IN MIND THE

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.525
AVAILABILITY OF COURT FACILITIES

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.127
FOR PLACING NEW JUDGES.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.262
AND TO ENSURE THAT SMALL COURTS

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.631
ARE ELIGIBLE A TO QUALIFY FOR

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.099
NEW JUDGESHIPS.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.668
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.136
OUR ALLOCATION MODEL.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.838
IS ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:38.040
COURTS OF VERY DIFFERENT SIZES

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.742
SO IN SAN BERNADINO FOR EXAMPLE

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.244
A LARGE JURISDICTION -- THEY

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.713
NEED THIRTY EIGHT JUDGESHIPS A

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.282
SMALL CORD. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.785
LASSEN OR SHASTA MAY NEED ONLY

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.153
ONE SHOULD SHIP BUT THAT ONE

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.157
JUDGESHIP REPRESENTS 30% OF THE

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.124
WORKLOAD NEED IN THAT COURT.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.693
SO WE USE A METHOD THAT'S VERY

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:58.694
SIMILAR TO HOW SEATS ARE

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.229
APPORTIONED IN CONGRESS IT'S

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.563
BASED ON THE EQUAL PROPORTIONS

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.731
METHOD.

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:05.334
AND IT BASICALLY ACCOUNTS.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.436
FOR BUT I'D COURTS NUMERIC NEED

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:08.570
THEIR PERCENTAGE NEED FOR

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.606
JUDGESHIP AND ALSO THE RELATIVE

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.241
NEED FOR THAT FIRST JUDGESHIP.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.509
COMPARED TO ALL OTHER JUDGESHIPS

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.310
NEEDED.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.478
BUT THE BRANCHES RIGHT IN THE

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.313
MIDST OF UPDATING THE CASE

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.549
WEIGHTS THAT ARE USED TO MEASURE.

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:21.984
BY HOW MUCH TIME IS NEEDED FOR

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.819
CASES OF VARIOUS TYPES LAST

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.488
UPDATE OF OUR MODEL WAS.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:27.089
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THERE

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:29.358
ARE ALL SORTS OF NEW TYPES OF

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.293
WORKLOAD AND CHANGES IN WORKLOAD

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.729
AS WELL AS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY --

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.130
THAT.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:37.566
HAVE NECESSITATED US TO UPDATE

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:41.069
THE MODEL -- THE BRANCH.

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:43.171
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT I EVEN WITH

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.973
A NEW MODEL THAT WE WILL BE SEEN

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.776
VERY SIMILAR -- THE SAME CHORDS

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.378
THAT NEED JUDGESHIPS UNDER OUR

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.812
CURRENT MODEL WILL BE THE SAME

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.548

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.450
WE HAVE ARE HAVING TO OVERCOME

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:58.120
MANY YEARS OF NOT HAVING NEW

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.955
JUDGESHIPS ALLOCATED BUT AT THE

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.623
SAME TIME POPULATION HOUSING

CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.480
FUNDING.

REQUEST WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT --

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:33.655
UNDER THE JUDICIAL NEEDS

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.157
ASSESSMENT A WHILE THERE IS AN

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.858
IDENTIFIED NEED OF TWO HUNDRED

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:37.893
AND SEVENTEEN JUDGES IN SEVENTY

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.627
COUNTIES.

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:39.962
THERE'S ACTUALLY A COMPATIBLE

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:43.665
NUMBER OF JUDGES IN OTHER COURTS

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.534
THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF OR MORE

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.336
THAN WHAT THE ASSESSED WORKLOAD

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.337

RESOURCES TO EQUALIZE --

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.110
WORKLOAD THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.512
ALSO CONSIDER RE ALLOCATING --

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:59.748
JUDGESHIPS FROM THOSE THAT HAVE

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:05.954
MORE JUDGES AND THEIR THOUGHTS

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.056
NEED TO THOSE THAT HAVE LESS.

OKAY MAY COME AS FOR MEMBERS.

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.161

BEFORE THAT.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.807
I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY THAT LOST

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.175
ITS COURTHOUSE JUDE DUE TO A

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:28.844
LACK OF JUDGES SO I GOT TO

OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE MEANS FOR A

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:32.981
COMMUNITY.

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.182
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.183
WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.818

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.490
MILLION DOLLARS PER JUDGE FOR

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:16.625

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.076
REDISTRIBUTING JUDGES -- I THINK --

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.444
THE TERRIBLE WAY OF RESPONDING

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.512
THAT WOULD BE -- THAT IT THAT

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:38.647
HAS LOW POLITICAL FEASIBILITY.

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.682

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.648
ABOUT PEOPLE TRAVELING TO COURT

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:15.350
HOUSES THAT WERE CLOSE.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.722
WE'RE TRYING TO RE OPEN AGAIN.

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.691
AND IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.359
HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR OF OF

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.228
PEOPLE HAVING TO TRAVEL.

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.997
OF A HUNDRED MILES ON THE BUS.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.033
TO GET ACCESS -- TO CIVIL SUITS

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.935

GO SOMEWHERE.

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.174
AND IT WAS CLOSED OR TO HAVE TO

SINCE THEN -- ENOUGH EXPERIENCE

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:54.676
WITH THAT MODEL TO REALIZE THAT

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.978
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF AREAS FOR

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:57.211
WE HAD.

01:26:57.278 --> 01:27:02.550
GAPS -- WE DID NOT HAVE -- AN

AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.884
HERE IS ESSENTIALLY A JOSH THE

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.786

WE NOTE THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:08.850
THE CURRENT -- MEDICATION

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.285

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:19.614
THE CHALLENGES WE WE DO KNOW

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.116
THAT WE NEED -- WE NEED THESE

A ONE YEAR BASIS WE CAN ONLY GO

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.891
AFTER ESSENTIALLY A LIMITED TERM --

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.959
TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:34.328
WHICH MAKES THESE POSITIONS

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:37.431
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE IF IT

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:39.767
TURNS OUT THAT WERE WRONG -- WE

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.569
OBVIOUSLY AND WE HAVE OVER

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.437
STAFFING AND WE ARE MEASURING

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:45.740
PRODUCTIVITY AND BACKLOGS WE

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:47.575
HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT CAN TELL

AND HAVE THAT ADJUSTED.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.416
END OF THE POPULATION BEGINS TO

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:58.486
DROP FURTHER -- THAT WILL RESULT

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:01.055
IN NATURALLY AND A REDUCTION IN

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:04.225
THE NUMBER OF BUT PROVIDERS SO --

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.261
I I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:08.329
IS.

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:10.164
LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS MAKE

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.833
THE ADJUSTMENT ON A PERMANENT

01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:13.968
BASIS -- IF THE NUMBER START TO

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:20.641
GO DOWN AND POPULATION NUMBERS

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.243
OF PROVIDERS WILL GO DOWN

HELLO.

01:31:24.478 --> 01:31:25.546
I WOULD MAKE TWO COMMENTS ON THE

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:26.147
THE FIRST IS THAT THIS WOULD

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:27.415
JUST BE A APPROVING THAT

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:28.282
POSITION COUNTY BE CHANGE THE

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:29.450
METHODOLOGY SO THAT.

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.618
IF THE POPULATION WERE TO GO

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:31.686
DOWN THE NEED WOULD NECESSARILY

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.920
GO BACK DOWN BY THE SAME AMOUNT

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.188
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:34.989
AT ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT AMOUNT.

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.457

AND LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WILL

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:38.526
NOTE THAT MANY OF THESE

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:40.027
POSITIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:41.329
FILL IN THE PAST AND AS A RESULT

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:42.697
THE RECEIVER HAS RELIED ON

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:44.532
REGISTRY POSITIONS.

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:46.200
WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT IF THIS

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:47.902
WAS APPROVED ON A ONE YEAR BASIS

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:51.939
THEY WOULD USE THAT FUNDING FOR

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:52.340
REGISTRY SERVICES.

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:55.109
THANK YOU.

ONGOING REPORTING.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.526
IN THE USAGE IF THIS I WERE TO

THESE FACILITIES.

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:28.943
IF YOU DO THESE ONE TIME YOU'RE

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.544
GONNA HAVE TO USE REGISTRY WHICH

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:31.779
IS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:34.181
EXPENSIVE AS A REGULAR POSITION.

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:35.516
YOU HAVE IN THE OUR ENDS I THINK

LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS.

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:56.270
THAT IT THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE A

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:57.672
MUCH MORE WASTEFUL WAY OF DOING

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.307
THINGS THAN ACTUALLY FILL THESE

01:32:59.373 --> 01:32:59.874

WITH REGISTRY THAT COST QUITE

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.762
FRANKLY THREE TIMES AS MUCH IF

NOT MORE -- WE HAVE HAD A LONG

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.701
TERM PROBLEM AND THE ONLY WAY

SEVERAL YEARS -- THROUGHOUT THE

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:59.393

IT CALIFORNIA'S OF OUR PRISON

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:19.847
SYSTEM -- HAS THE DISTINCTION OF

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:22.616

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.892
I WORRY WE'RE AT ABOUT THREE

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:35.629
TIMES ARE HIGHER RATES OF OPIOID --

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:38.766
OVERDOSE DEATHS -- OF THE

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:42.036
PROGRAM -- THAT -- HELLO.

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.271
IS BEING ASKED FOR IN THIS --

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:47.508
BUDGET PROPOSAL IS BRAND NEW AND

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.410
WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:51.078
ATTEMPTING TO TREAT.

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:53.314
WITH -- MEDICALLY ASSISTED

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.916
TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- BUT

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:59.019
PRISONERS WHO HAVE -- OPIOID IT

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.956
AND ALL OTHER -- ABUSE ON

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:04.558
DISORDERS -- SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:07.027
TO BUILD A PROGRAM ON LARGELY

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.896
FROM THE GROUND UP -- THE

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.799
DEPARTMENT HAS ENGAGED IN A VERY

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:13.567
SUBSTANTIAL PLANNING EFFORT --

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:16.537
DRAWING UPON THE EXPERIENCE THAT

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:19.507
WE'VE HAD IN A PILOT PROGRAM.

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:20.808
THAT THE LEGISLATURE OFF

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.010
AUTHORIZED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:25.479
I BELIEVE -- WE'VE DONE A PILOT

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:28.716
IN TWO INSTITUTIONS -- WE HAVE

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.784
NOW DEVELOPED SOME EXPERIENCE

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.154
AND EXPERTISE IN THE OF WHAT YOU

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.256
HAVE TO DO A FOR THIS TYPE OF

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.557
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:37.892
AND WE ARE NOW READY TO ROLL

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:42.263
THAT OUT.

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:43.330
OF THE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:44.798
WE WILL BE TARGETING INITIALLY

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.100
THREE GROUPS OF PATIENTS.

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:48.569
FIRST OF THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.905
TO CDC ARE AND ARE ALREADY ALL

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:53.440
ON OF THIS TYPE OF A TREATMENT

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:54.708
PROGRAM.

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.310
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.179
CONTINUITY OF TREATMENT.

01:36:58.245 --> 01:37:00.080
PREVIOUSLY PEOPLE HAVE COME IN

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.682
AND WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:05.186
OFFER THEM THIS TREATMENT.

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.620
PROTOCOL SECOND.

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:08.489
I'M GONNA BE TARGETING --

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.057
PATIENTS WORTH IN EIGHTEEN

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:14.361
MONTHS OF PAROLE OR RELEASE --

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:15.863
TO SEE IF WE CAN PREPARE THEM

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.364
OFF FOR THE TIME WHEN THE GOING

01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:19.633
TO WALK OUT THE OF THE GATES AND

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.402
BE IN THE FREE WORLD -- AND

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.636
HOPEFULLY.

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.805
HELP THEM BE IN A BETTER

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:26.273
POSITION.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.409
ON A TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:31.879
RELEASE I AM NOT TO GO BACK.

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:35.649
TO OF IT USING DRUGS AND WITH

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.017
THEM WHICH CARRIES WITH IT BOTH

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:42.189
A HIGHER RISK OF DEATH -- AS

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.757
WELL AS A RECIDIVIST.

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.226
OF THE THIRD GROUP -- OF

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.594
PATIENTS OF WE WILL INITIALLY

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.329
TARGET OR THOSE WHO ARE HIGH

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:50.998
RISK -- ABUSERS.

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:53.033
ON THESE WOULD BE PATIENTS WHO

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.168
HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AN

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:56.070
OVERDOSE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.538
KNOW IT'S VERY LIKELY ONCE

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.773
YOU'VE DONE THAT -- MEET YOUR IN

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.376
OF A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:04.411
REPEATING -- THERE ARE OTHER

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:06.847
CLINICAL INDICATIONS OF A HIGH

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:09.750
RISK OF THAT WE WOULD BE USING

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:12.419
TO TARGET THOSE -- PATIENTS IN

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:13.921
THE INITIAL ROLLOUT.

01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:16.290
I THANK ALL STOP THEIR HAPPENING

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:18.092
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE WITH

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:21.295
ME DOCTOR AND IT CAME IN -- WHO

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:26.000
HELPED LEAD THE PLANNING EFFORT --

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.035
UP FOR THIS PROGRAM.

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:31.739
COMMENTS FROM FINANCE -- CLING

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:32.439
COMING APART A FINANCE --

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.008
NOTHING FURTHER OTHER THAN TO

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:37.478
SAY THAT -- THE OVERDOSE DEATHS --

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:39.246
IF YOU KNOW IS A STRIKING METRIC

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.348
THAT REQUIRES ATTENTION -- I

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.717
THINK -- THE COMMUNITY STANDARD

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:44.752
MOVING FORWARD IF PROVIDING

01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:46.287
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:47.655
ALMOST AS A HEALTH CARE

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:48.656
DISCIPLINE FOR THOSE THAT NEED

IT -- IS APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:52.559
THAT KIND OF STUFF --

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:56.263
SIGNIFICANT -- PROBLEM AND WE

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.864
THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:59.767
THAT [inaudible]

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.036
COMMENTS MELLOW.

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.404
FIGURE THERE SHOULD BE A HANDOUT

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.938
THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU --

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:06.440
GOING TO PAGE ONE OF THAT --

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:08.142
VIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S ICD T.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.510
PROPOSAL THIRTY WERE PROVIDED A

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:10.911
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL OVERVIEW OF

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:11.979
THE PROPOSAL I WOULDN'T KNOW.

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.547
THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THIS IS

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:16.216
NOT JUST TO INCREASE MA T. BUT

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.851
ALSO TO INCREASE COGNITIVE

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.653
BEHAVIOR THERAPY PROGRAMS AS

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.954
WELL AS OTHER PROGRAMS AND OR

THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.225
PROGRAMMING -- SO WE'RE NOTE

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.494
THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:28.062
THAT WOULD BE FOUR MILLION

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:28.862
DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD INCREASE

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.464
BY AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY SEVEN

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:36.870
MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY

ONGOING BASIS.

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:40.374
GOING ON TO PAGE -- TWO WE

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.642
IDENTIFY UMBER OF ISSUES FOR

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:45.779
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION --

01:39:45.846 --> 01:39:46.613
FIRST OF ALL OF THIS WOULD BE A

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.648
LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:48.315
UNTESTED PROGRAM.

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:49.850
WELL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM HAVE

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.218
BEEN FOUND TO BE EVIDENCE BASED

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.187
THIS COMBINATION OF SERVICES HAS

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:55.055
NOT BEEN TESTED WITH THESE

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:57.324
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS IN MIND --

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.827
IN ADDITION SOME ASPECTS OF THE

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.528
PROS ALL HAVE NOT BEEN EVIDENCE --

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:02.629
ARE NOT OF IN SPACE AND HAVE NOT

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:03.630
BEEN EVALUATED CORRECTIONAL

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.899
SETTINGS FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.301
MEDICATIONS THAT THIS PROPOSAL

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:09.370
WOULD BE USED TO TREAT

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:10.537
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD -- CODE USED

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:11.805
TO SORT ARE HAS NEVER BEEN

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:14.141
TESTED A CORRECTIONAL SETTING.

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:15.142
THERE IS ONE PILOT OF IT NOT

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:17.111
BEING PROPOSED IN PENNSYLVANIA

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:18.645
HOWEVER DID IMPLEMENTATION

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:19.713
CHALLENGES IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.216
LAUNCH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:23.617
NINETEEN BUT AS OF THE END OF

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:24.385
APRIL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:25.419
ENROLL ANY.

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:27.287
PARTICIPANTS INTO THE PROGRAM

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:27.988
THAT.

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:30.491
MEDICATION REFERRING TO IS A

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.625
LONG LASTING INJECTABLE FORM OF

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.093
MOVEMENT OR FEELING WHICH COST

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:37.931
FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS THE ORAL

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.666
PORTIONS OF THE MEDICATION.

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:41.101
IN ADDITION -- THE COST

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:41.668
ESTIMATES IN THIS PROPOSAL

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:42.169
SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.337
UNCERTAINTY.

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:43.971
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.472
ESTIMATES WERE BASED OFF OF A

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.007
VARIETY OF SOURCES FROM OTHER

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.143
STATES AND NOT ARE NOT SO

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:51.645
EFFECTIVE OF CDC OURS POPULATION.

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:52.846
THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HAVE AN

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.648
IMPACT ON THE PRICE.

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.083
OF THIS PROGRAM GOING.

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:57.785
IN A RANGE OF TENS OF MILLIONS

PURITIES DISORDERS -- THAT WOULD

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.502
BE ENOUGH FOR TWENTY FIVE

ADMINISTRATION'S NOTED THAT

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:31.785

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:33.320
TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WE'RE

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:34.688
NOT SURE WHAT THE ADDITIONAL TO

YOURS WOULD ENTAIL AND WHAT

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.492
RESOURCES WOULD BE NECESSARY.

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:39.660
IT'S ALSO LIKELY THAT THIS

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:40.060
PROPOSAL WILL HAVE

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.462

THIS PROPOSAL. FOR INSTANCE I

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:46.467
MAY BE A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:51.839
NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL MEDICATION

01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:54.508

IN ADDITION OUR POTENTIAL

01:41:57.945 --> 01:42:00.113
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WHILE

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.648
THE OUR PILOTS RIGHT NOW IN THE

PRESENT AND THREE PRESENTS FOR

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:04.685
MEDICATIONS IS THE TREATMENT.

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.186
THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBSTANTIALLY

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.921
DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PROPOSALS

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.690
AS A RESULT THE IT BERMAN TATIAN

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:10.691
OF THOSE PILOTS MAY NOT

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:12.693

INFORMATION NECESSARY TO

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:15.462
IMPLEMENT THE CURRENT PILOTS --

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:17.331
INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:18.732
ALSO INCLUDING OVER ALL OF IT

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.000
ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AND WOULD BE

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.135
A MUCH LARGER SCALE THAN WHAT

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:24.338
THOSE PILOTS ARE -- THIS ALSO

01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:25.939
GOES INTO THE RE ENTRY

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:28.242
COORDINATION -- ONLY A FEW DOZEN

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.543
INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN RELEASED

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.078
FROM THE PILOT PROGRAMS AND

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:32.613
WHILE MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.081
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO RE ENTRY

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:34.815
SERVICES.

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:36.016
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE CREATE A

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:38.018
SEPARATE PROCESS FOR ADDRESSING

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:40.554
RE ENTRY AND IT WOULD BE DOING

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:42.256
SO ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE IT IS

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.190
NOT CLEAR THAT.

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:44.491
IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY LINK

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:46.193
THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SERVICES

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.661

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:01.875
DIEM CODIS.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:07.881
WHICH IT PROPELLED RIGHT

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.416
TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:12.419
IN ADDITION -- WE FIND THAT THIS

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:13.720
PROPOSAL GIVEN LIMITED OVERSIGHT

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:15.556
OVER THE CVT PROGRAMS AND NOTE

REHABILITATION AND RECIDIVISM

01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:23.397
OUTCOMES FOR OFFENDERS -- THIS

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:25.299
PROPOSAL WOULD BE INCREASING THE

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:27.267
SIZE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WHILE

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:28.502

DRUGS INTO THE FACILITIES AND BY

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:49.856
INCREASING THE STUFF IT COULD

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:53.327
ACTUALLY BE TWO MORE CONTRABAND

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:55.095
AND TRYING TO FACILITIES.

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:57.197

AN OVERDOSE DEATHS.

01:44:32.399 --> 01:44:33.900
WE OUGHT ESTIMATE THAT -- PILOT

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:35.569
OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD COST

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:38.639
LESS THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:39.272
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND WOULD

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.207
BE UNLIKELY TO EXCEED TWENTY

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:41.908
MILLION DOLLARS AT FULL

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.543
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:45.412
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:46.880
IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE AYE STD T.

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:48.815
PROGRAM RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.183
PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:51.718
THESE CONCERNS -- SUCH

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.187
MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE REQUIRING

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:56.023
A MORE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION --

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:57.524
AND ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT FROM

01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:59.459
CDC ARE AND THE RECEIVER ON THE

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:00.661
PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTED

01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:02.396
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS.

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:04.831
AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION ONCE

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:06.633
THE PROGRAM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.335
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WANTED

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:09.603
MENTIONED BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:10.370
BROUGHT UP.

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.139
ABOUT OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THE

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.974
PRISONS THERE ARE ABOUT FOURTY

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.877
OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT LOST YOUR

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:19.046
FRONT.

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.614
IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME OF THOSE

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:22.082
WAR OVERDOSE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.850
OPIOIDS -- HOW WE NOTE THAT THIS

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:25.986
PROPOSAL ASSUMES THAT A COULD BE

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.055
A 50% UP TAKE GREAT -- SET

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:29.322
MEANING THAT 50% OF INDIVIDUALS

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.357
WHICH USED TO TAKE MEDICATION

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.958
ASSIST TREATMENT AND 50% WOULD

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.226
NOT GO INTO IT.

01:45:33.293 --> 01:45:34.294
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS

01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:36.496
PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:39.066
OVERDOSE DEATHS AS A RESULT.

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:42.669
WITHIN THE PRISONS THANK YOU.

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:43.870
MANY OF THE COMMENTS THE

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:45.238
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS.

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.607
THIS JONES SAWYER.

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:50.444
I DON'T THINK HE LIKED.

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.945
TO YOU ARE RESPOND.

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.714
IT OR CAN YOU SHORTEN IT WAS SO

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.716
MUCH WELL I GUESS TWO THINGS

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:56.983
THAT WAS THE THERE WAS A LOT

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:59.019
THAT WAS APPARENTLY WRONG WITH

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:02.122
THE PROPOSAL -- I I DID FIND IT

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.690
STRIKING THE SUGGESTION THAT.

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:06.493
BY ADDING MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.395
TREAT THE DISEASE WE ACTUALLY

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:09.730
WILL MAKE THE PROGRAM WORSE

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:11.798
BECAUSE SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:17.070
THEM WILL -- OF SMUGGLE IN DRUGS

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:17.704
THIS IS LA -- REALLY SUGGESTING

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:18.772
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD SOLVE THE

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.607
DRUG PROBLEM BY REDUCING THE

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.342
NUMBER OF STAFF.

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:24.845
AT CDC ARE.

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:25.245
THAT'S JUST NOT.

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:28.048
ON A SERIOUS CRITICISM.

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:31.051
I DO THINK THE PROBLEM -- WITH

01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:33.687
MOST OF WHAT -- OF THE LA -- IS

01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:35.255
SUGGESTING.

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:37.357
COMES DOWN TO THE FOLLOWING.

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:38.458
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE GREATER

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:40.393
CERTAINTY.

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:40.961
YEAH I'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:41.628
CERTAINTY.

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:43.764
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE FIFTEEN

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:45.532
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE DONE THIS

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:47.567
BEFORE US.

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:49.002
WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:51.772
TO ARM WOULD BE NICE.

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:54.741
TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:56.309
ARE LIKELY EFFORT TO SEE WHAT IS

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:59.446
GOING TO BE OF THIS PROGRAM YEAH.

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:01.648
BUT IN THE MEANTIME.

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:03.950
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:06.353
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TREATING.

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:08.855
AND WE HAVE THIS YEAR EIGHT

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:09.456
HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:11.892
OVER GOES.

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:13.994
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.897
WE START OUT WITH ANOTHER PILOT.

01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:18.098
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DONE DOING

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:19.599
SMALL PILOTS THAT REALLY DON'T

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:22.769
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. FOR WHAT

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.405
FIVE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS.

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:26.306
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:28.241
NOW.

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:30.210
IT'S A BIG.

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.646
PROJECT A BIG INITIATIVE.

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:33.680
THERE ARE BIG RISKS ASSOCIATED

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:36.183
WITH IT.

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.218
BUT I THINK CDC ARE HAS SHOWN

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.553
OVER THE PAST DECADE.

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:43.323
THAT WE CAN DO BIG THINGS.

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.126
WE CAN IMPLEMENT LARGE RIGHT T.

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:48.228
SYSTEMS SONGS THE ELECTRONIC

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.863
HEALTH RECORD.

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.566
WE CAN WOULD COMPLETELY REMAKE

01:47:52.632 --> 01:47:53.834
HEALTH CARE.

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:56.570
WE CAN DO TO HELP SEE PROGRAM.

01:47:56.636 --> 01:47:57.971
BUT TREATING THOUSANDS OF

01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:59.673
INMATES.

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:02.209
SO -- I AM ASKING ON THE

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:05.078
ADMINISTRATION I THINK IS ASKING

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.746
FOR SOME TRUST AND CONFIDENCE

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:07.981
THAT WE REALIZE THERE ARE RISKS

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:09.182
HERE.

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:10.784
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE WATCHING VERY

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:11.952
CLOSELY.

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.887
UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.121
GETS IMPLEMENTED.

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:18.258
OUT CORRECTLY.

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:20.327
WHAT I MAY WANT TO SUGGEST THAT

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:24.030
WE HAVE A A COLLEAGUE -- WHO HAS

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:25.832
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR NEEDLE

01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:26.433
EXCHANGE WITH A COLLEAGUE FROM

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:27.467
STOCKTON?

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:29.402
ON THAT I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:31.404
ABOUT AND AND I I MAY HAVE SAID

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.006
SOME DISPARAGING THINGS ABOUT.%

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:35.809
HER PROGRAM AND AND THAT THE

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:38.044
STATE IS SANCTIONING.

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:39.446
PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD BASICALLY GET

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.414
STATE GET HIGH CENTERS.

01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:45.819
AND ONCE SHE FULLY EXPLAIN HOW

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:47.420
IT WORKED ONCE SHE FULLY

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.955
EXPLAINED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:51.524
RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE.

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:53.994
IN THESE DIFFERENT PLACES --

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:54.594
THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE OFF THE

01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:55.462
DRUGS.

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.497
ONCE I WENT TO ONE OF THOSE

01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:59.132
CENTERS IN AND SAW IT WAS

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:00.533
EXPERIMENTAL NAME YOU HAVE TO GO

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.035
OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO SEE.

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.570
WHERE SOMEBODY'S NEEDLE EXCHANGE

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:06.072
PROGRAMS WORK -- ONCE I ACTUALLY

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:07.073
SAW.

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.709
AND SAW IT ACTUALLY DID WAS

01:49:09.776 --> 01:49:10.977
REALLY MORE OF A DRUG

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.979
REHABILITATION PROGRAM THAT

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.614
HAPPENED TO PROVIDE.

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:16.383
NEIL CHANGE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:19.386
KILLING THEMSELVES.

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.553
YEAH I TOLD YOU NEED TO SAY IT

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.488
BACKWARDS.

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.356
NOT THE RIGHT WAY.

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:24.457
AND AND TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THE

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:26.559
TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:28.361
TREAT PEOPLE HOW SUCCESSFUL IS

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.230
GOING TO BE SOME MY

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.598
RECOMMENDATION IN IN AN OPENING.

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:33.900
THE LIMITED TIME THAT -- YOU CAN

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:36.403
ACTUALLY MAYBE INVITE.

01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:38.238
THE LA -- TO COME OVER AND SEE

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:40.173
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OR ART

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.776
OR SIT DOWN AND FULLY EXPLAIN --

01:49:42.842 --> 01:49:44.311
THE THE ENTIRE.

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:46.813
TEA UP THE PROGRAM -- AND HOW IT

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.849
HAS AN IMPACT ON ON WHAT YOU

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.985
WANNA DO IS IT IS IT NEW.

01:49:52.052 --> 01:49:54.654
IS IT BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.122
AND THINGS.

01:49:56.189 --> 01:50:02.462
YEAH BUT WE WE WE CAN GET OVER

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:02.662
THAT.

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:05.398
YOU KNOW I REMEMBER SEEN STAR

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:06.766
TRAKS A WOULD NEVER HAVE.

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:09.602
FLIP PHONES AND WE WERE BEYOND

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:10.203
FLIP FLIP PHONES HAPPEN WITH.

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.705
IT SO I I WOULD SUGGEST AS THE

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.273
NEW TECHNOLOGY NEW TREATMENT

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.541
WAYS OF TREATMENT THAT.

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:16.977
THE SPINDLE MORE TIME -- TALKING

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.478

OF ONE OF THE I GUESS ONE OF THE

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:30.090
CONCERNS AND AND AS THIS IS THE

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.624
AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS IS A

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:32.759
VERY LARGE.

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:35.495
PROPOSAL AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:38.064
IMPLEMENTING OF ARE YOU A

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:41.534
PROGRAM -- THAT THE I KNOW ONE

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.169
OF THEM HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:44.704
SUCCESS SO I THINK THE COGNITIVE

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.940
BEHAVIOR PROGRAM ONE OF OUR

01:50:47.007 --> 01:50:49.809
STATE AUDITOR'S CONCLUDED THAT --

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:51.811
IT REALLY WAS NOT OF WAS NOT WE

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:53.680
WERE BASICALLY DOING MUCH IN

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:56.282
TERMS OF RECIDIVISMIN TERMS OF

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:57.951
PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM GETTING

01:50:58.018 --> 01:50:59.719
OUT AND NOT BEING A BEING ABLE

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.721
TO STAY OUT -- HAVE YOU DRESS

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:03.156
THAT SSUE OR IS THAT GOING TO

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:05.191
BE ADDRESSED THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.227
CONCERNS WITH THE PROGRAM TO HIS.

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:07.894
THIS THING IS SO LARGE AND WE'RE

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:09.829
ROLLING IT OUT EVERYWHERE RATHER

01:51:09.896 --> 01:51:11.031
THAN IN.

01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:13.099
PHASES OR SOMETHING AND ALONG

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:14.401
THE WAY THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.102
DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF OF THE

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.004
PROGRAM ITSELF BEING EFFECTIVE

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:19.439
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.041
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.343
SUFFICIENTLY TO SAY IT'S NOW WE

01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:27.881
CAN GO PRIME TIME YOU KNOW TEMP

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:29.916
THE PROGRAM ITSELF.

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.084
A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:31.651
MEMBERS A RAINS IS A DEPUTY

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:32.886

REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS -- TO

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:34.087
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:36.423
THIS PROPOSAL FINALIZES ALL OF

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:37.390
THOSE ISSUES THAT WE HAD SEEN

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:39.826
PREVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:40.827
EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.128
ASSESSMENTS AND GETTING PEOPLE

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:42.996
INTO PROGRAM.

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:43.997
BY HAVING US CONNECT WITH

01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:45.231
MEDICAL AND HAVE THAT REFERRAL

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:46.633
COME DIRECTLY FROM MEDICAL

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.001
THROUGH THAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:48.968
REALLY GETTING PEOPLE INTO

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.570
PROGRAM WHEN THEY NEED TO BE

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.638
THERE AS PART OF THEIR CLINICAL

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:53.540
CARE -- WE HAD INCONSISTENT AND

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.341
DISCONNECTED COMPONENTS WE SAT

01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:56.810
DOWN WITH EXPERTS AND MEDICAL TO

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.578
DEVELOP A CURRICULUM THAT IS

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.180
BOTH IN PLACE CONSISTENTLY

01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:01.681
DELIVERED ACROSS THIRTY FIVE

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:03.450
INSTITUTIONS AND DO IT DOING

01:52:03.516 --> 01:52:04.184
THAT CONSISTENTLY AND

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.351
CONCURRENTLY.

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:06.019
SO THE PEOPLE ARE ASSESSING THAT

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:07.754
TREATMENT AND THEN SOME OTHER

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:09.289
THINGS ABOUT CURRICULUM VARIETY

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:10.890
INFIDELITY WE HAD MASSIVE

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:12.125
CURRICULUMS ALL OVER THIRTY FIVE

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:13.393
INSTITUTIONS WERE PUTTING ONE IN

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.127
PLACE.

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:15.328
AND WE'RE ALSO PUTTING THE TOOLS

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.063
IN PLACE THE MEDICALS BEEN

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:17.831
LEVERAGING THROUGH THEIR

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.399
DASHBOARDS WE'VE DEVELOPED

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:21.734
WEEKLY MONTHLY DASHBOARDS TO

01:52:21.801 --> 01:52:22.168
MAKE SURE THAT WERE

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:23.503
OPERATIONALIZE IN IT WE HAVE AN

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:24.771
EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:26.005
THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPING

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:27.040
REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.708
HAPPENING -- APPROPRIATELY AND

01:52:28.775 --> 01:52:30.110
ACCORDING TO TIME LINES AND DEAR

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:32.846
P. IS VERY WELL VERSED IN --

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:34.948
DOING STATE WIDE EXPANSES ACROSS

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:35.815
THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS WE DO

01:52:35.882 --> 01:52:37.350
THAT CONTRACTUALLY NOW SO I

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:38.885
THINK EVERYTHING THAT WE PUT IN

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:40.687
PLACE IN TERMS OF FOUNDATIONAL

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:42.722
OVERSIGHT -- AND THEN OUR

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:43.957
INCLUSION WITH MEDICAL AND

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:45.859
MAKING THIS MODEL WORK TOGETHER --

01:52:45.925 --> 01:52:46.993
AND INCLUDING THE REENTRY

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.761
RESOURCES REALLY SOLIDIFIES A

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:49.996
PROGRAM THAT CREATES A

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.698
CONNECTION FROM IN PRISON ALL

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:52.765
THE WAY TO THE COMMUNITY AND

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:57.871
THAT'S REALLY -- THE CRITICAL

01:52:57.937 --> 01:53:00.106
COMPONENT HERE.

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.742
OKAY THEIR COMMENTS.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:05.945
QUESTIONS WITH SYSTEM YES.

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:06.579
POLICIES AS I LOOK AT THIS WHAT

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:07.747
WHAT STRIKES ME IS.

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:09.582
THAT A LOT OF THIS IS WHAT%

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:11.951
CITIES ARE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:12.585
DOING ALL ALONG.

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:13.953
SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE COMING

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.688
AND ASKING FOR MONEY NOW FOR

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:16.956
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:53:17.023 --> 01:53:18.791
BUILT IN REALLY.

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:20.493
BUT I UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHERE

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.228
WE'VE COME AND WHERE WE'RE GOING.

01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:23.163
TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THESE

01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:25.165
INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:26.499
MAKING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:28.801
SERIOUS ABOUT CLEANING WAS IF

01:53:28.868 --> 01:53:29.335
YOU LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE ARE

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:29.969
PRESENT.

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.938
A LOT OF IT IS DRUG RELATED A

01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:33.473
LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:34.607
HAVE.

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:36.609
PROGRAMS ENOUGH PROGRAMS OUT IN

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:38.077
OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THESE

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:39.145
ISSUES TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:41.147
PRISON.

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:43.516
SO THIS INVESTMENT IT PROBABLY

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.151
MAKES SENSE HERE BUT THIS AND

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:45.885
THAT'S WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:46.719
REPLICATED.

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:48.221
IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:49.989
SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IT

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:51.124
BECOMES A PROBLEM.

01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:52.959
THAT CDC OUR NEEDS TO TAKE ON ON

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.093
ITS OWN.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.094
SO I'M HOPING THIS COMMITTEE

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:56.029
WITH IT WILL TAKE THIS ASK VERY

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:59.232
SERIOUSLY AND REALLY LOOK AT THE

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:02.101
DEPENDENCY ISSUES AND PROVIDE

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:04.370
THAT THAT MECHANISM FOR GETTING

01:54:04.437 --> 01:54:06.639
PEOPLE OUT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:07.540
GOT THEM INTO PRISON THE FIRST

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:08.174
PLACE.

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:10.243
THAT'S THE REHABILITATIVE PIECE

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:13.346
THAT HAS LONG BEEN MISSING.

01:54:13.413 --> 01:54:14.814
SO I KNOW IT'S A BIG OF EXPENSE

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:16.649
I KNOW IT'S A BIG ASK.

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:18.484
WHETHER IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT HARD

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:19.452
TO TELL I DON'T KNOW YOU WILL

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:20.687
GET THIS IS ONLY WE'RE GONNA

01:54:20.753 --> 01:54:22.288
HAVE TO EXPERIMENT AND I WOULD

01:54:22.355 --> 01:54:23.690
HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:24.924
HAVE FIFTEEN OTHER STATES DO

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.025
SOMETHING BEFORE.

01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:28.561
WE CAN STEP IN AND IT IT REALLY

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:30.997
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

01:54:31.064 --> 01:54:32.131
OTHER STATES ALSO DON'T HAVE THE

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:33.666
SAME LEVEL OF INCARCERATION THAT

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:35.001
WE DO OTHER STATES.

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:37.036
THAT DON'T HAVE HAVEN'T REALLY

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.372
CREATED THIS LARGE MASS THAT

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:41.708
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OURSELVES

01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:42.375
OUT FROM UNDERNEATH.

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:43.676
SO WHETHER THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT

01:54:43.743 --> 01:54:44.510
I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK WE

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:46.145
SHOULD BE WILLING TO TO MAKE

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:47.180
SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING AND

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:48.681
THEN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND

01:54:48.748 --> 01:54:50.783
GETTING FEEDBACK BACK.

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.885
ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM'S WORKING.

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:54.554
SO THAT CAN BE INGESTED ALONG

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.656
THE WAY AND WE SHOULD BE HOLDING

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.424
CITIES HERE ACCOUNTABLE TO TO

01:54:58.491 --> 01:54:59.259
RESULTS.

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:00.727
OUT OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IF

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:01.227
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.396
INVESTMENT THAT'S THIS

01:55:03.463 --> 01:55:03.997
SUBSTANTIAL BUT I WOULD HOPE

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.565
THIS COMMITTEE.

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:06.799
WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE UP.

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.135
A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS SERIOUSLY

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:10.403
AND OF COURSE WORKING WITH THE

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:11.638
SENATE AND WITH THE

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.973
ADMINISTRATION BUT WHAT WE ALSO

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:14.874
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BUILDING

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:17.543
IN HERE IS ENOUGH.

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.345
ABILITY TO GET DATA BACK AND

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:20.179
REALLY.

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:21.848
SHOW SOME RESULTS BECAUSE I

01:55:21.914 --> 01:55:22.782
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE PAST

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:25.285
FOR US TO IN THE LONG RUN REDUCE

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:26.085
THE PRISON POPULATIONS AND

01:55:26.152 --> 01:55:27.287
REDUCE.

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:30.757
THE AMOUNT OF OF THE DRUG THE

01:55:30.823 --> 01:55:32.158
SITUATION THAT WE'RE FINDING IN

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:33.626
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:55:33.693 --> 01:55:34.694
SO.

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:36.229
I GUESS THAT'S MIGHT THE ONES

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:37.330
THAT I LOOK AT THIS I LOOK AT IS

01:55:37.397 --> 01:55:39.632
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THIS IS

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:40.266
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:41.100
BEING DONE.

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:43.002
ALL ALONG ANYWAY BUT IF WE'RE

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.437
GETTING AROUND TO DOING THIS NOW

01:55:44.504 --> 01:55:45.505
DOING IT APPROPRIATELY.

01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:48.474
LET'S DO IT BUT LET'S DO IT

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.142

THREE HUNDRED SITES THROUGHOUT

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:15.568
THE STATE -- AND MANY OF OUR

01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:16.703

ADVOCATED -- FOR THE INSTITUTION

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:32.785

IN PRISON SO WE ARE -- PLEASED

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:39.225
TO SEE THAT -- THAT IT IS NOW --

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:42.962

01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:46.332

01:56:46.399 --> 01:56:47.967
SUBMITTED.

01:56:48.034 --> 01:56:50.803

STRENGTHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:13.059
BECAUSE THE MEDICATION ALONE

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:14.927

THE REAL NEED FOR IT INCREASING

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:01.507
THE UP OPPOSED TO RELEASE

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:04.310

PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING RELEASED

I THINK WE HEAR THAT -- THIS IS

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:39.278
A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WITH AN

01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:41.013
AWFUL LOT OF FUNDING BEING PUT

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.382

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:45.051
THERE IS SOME.

A LOT OF MONEY SPENT AND NOT THE

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:53.993
RESULTS WE WANT I THINK THAT'S

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:54.627
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY POOR THE

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:56.863
SPECIALLY SINCE IT IS NEW AND WE

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.764

THEM INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.545
SERVICES WORLD.

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:48.314
WE POTENTIALLY MISS A REAL

KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND KIDS

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:55.187
WHO NEED OUR HELP KIDS WHO ARE

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:58.123
AT PROMISED USE MINE FROM

02:04:58.190 --> 02:04:59.291
COLLEAGUES TERM.

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:01.760
AND AND REALLY LOOK AT AT WHAT

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:04.029
THEY NEED AND SO WITH SOME OF

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:06.298
THE LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE THE

02:05:06.365 --> 02:05:08.601
CONCEPT IF WE'RE IF WE'RE REALLY

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:11.103
NOT BUILDING IN THERAPEUTIC

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:12.605
REHABILITATIVE MODELS AND ALL.

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:15.741
AND STILL HANGING KIDS IS BEING.

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:18.077
THE YOU KNOW THE BAD KIDS THAT

02:05:18.143 --> 02:05:19.745
MAYBE THERE'S SOME REDEMPTION AS

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.080
OPPOSED TO KIDS WHO REALLY

02:05:21.146 --> 02:05:23.983
STRUGGLE KIDS WHO OF WHO HAVE.

02:05:24.049 --> 02:05:25.517
BEEN TRAUMATIZED AND GONE TO

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.719
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

02:05:26.785 --> 02:05:28.387
AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE THE

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:29.889
REASON THAT THAT I WOULD HOPE WE

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:30.923
WERE BRING THEM.

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.057
INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:05:32.124 --> 02:05:33.459
SERVICES WORLD.

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:35.928
AND SO ONCE THAT HAVING A A MORE

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:37.930
COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM WHICH IS

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.732
NOT NECESSARILY YOUR ROLE IN

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.500
THIS BUT OF A PIECE OF IT BUT

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:43.168
I'M HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:44.837
WILL GO FURTHER.

02:05:44.904 --> 02:05:46.505
IN DESIGNING A PROGRAM THAT

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:49.275
ADDRESSES ISSUES THAT KIDS NEED

02:05:49.341 --> 02:05:51.610
IN ORDER.

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:52.912
TO TO NOT BE IN TROUBLE THE

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:53.479
FIRST PLACE TO GET OUT OF

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.481
TROUBLE. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.082
WHAT THEY DID ABSOLUTELY BUT A

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.684
DRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.551
THEY HAVE THAT GOT THEM IN THAT

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:02.054
SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:04.323
AND THAT'S YOU'RE TAKING KIDS

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:06.125
WHO HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE AND

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.159
NOW.

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.594
WE'RE REHABILITATING THEM.

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.462
IN HOPEFULLY THE BEST OF WAYS

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.531
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:14.366
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF KIDS WHO

02:06:14.433 --> 02:06:15.134
ARE.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.002
STRUGGLING IN THEIR COMMUNITY

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.536
STRUGGLING WITH AND THEIR

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:18.137
FAMILIES.

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:22.107
AND AND BE ABLE TO WRAP SERVICES

02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:24.276
AROUND THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:25.878
END UP IN.

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:27.079
IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:29.548
TROUBLE SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:32.584
WE WE GLOBALLY AND AND YOUR ROLE

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:34.320
THIS SPECIFIC TO THE KIDS WHO

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:35.788
ARE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND AND

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:37.256
COMING OUT OF THAT BUT TO THE

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:38.390
EXTENT WE STILL.

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:40.592
TREAT THOSE KIDS DIFFERENTLY AT

02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:41.794
AND CATEGORIZE THEM DIFFERENTLY

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.529
THAN I THINK WE'RE NOT SERVING A

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.230
BROADER MISSION THAT WE POSSIBLY

02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:46.932
CLICK HERE.

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:47.333
SO I HOPE THAT THE

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:48.500
ADMINISTRATION.

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:50.502
LOOKS BEYOND WHAT THIS SPECIFIC

02:06:50.569 --> 02:06:52.004
PROPOSAL IS A LOOK AT THE

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.872
OPPORTUNITY BE ABLE CIRCUITS

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:54.540
BETTER.

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:55.607
IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:58.744
WHETHER OR NOT THEY COME INTO.

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:00.346
THE PURVIEW OF OF THE STRUCTURE

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.380
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'VE

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:02.314
HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE I

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:03.282
JUST WANTED TO GO.

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:04.883
BACK ON THE RECORD FOR THAT

02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:06.986
BECAUSE I I THINK WE'RE REALLY

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:10.089
ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING THAT IS.

02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:10.956
SIGNIFICANT AND CAN BE

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:11.957
TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL.

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:13.859
BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:14.827
AT THE ENTIRE POPULATION THAT'S

02:07:14.893 --> 02:07:16.462
THERE NOT JUST KIDS HAVE DONE

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:18.497
SOMETHING WRONG.

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:20.866
AND GOT WRAPPED UP IN THAT BUT

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:23.569
ALSO KIDS WHO ARE.

02:07:23.635 --> 02:07:25.204
WHO NEED US TO STAND UP FOR THEM

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:27.439
AND AND GET A BETTER LEVEL OF

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:29.708
SERVICES I KEEP HOPING THAT THIS

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.043
CONVERSATION WILL BROUGHT?

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:32.544
AS WE GO THROUGH THIS INTO BEING

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:34.213
ABLE TO REALLY PROVIDE A COMMON

02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:36.582
SET OF SERVICES FOR ALL KIDS WHO

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.817
ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED IN NEED

02:07:38.884 --> 02:07:40.486
US TO HELP THEM.

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:41.754
WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.256
WITHIN THEIR FAMILIES THRIVE AND

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:45.357
INTO MUCH BETTER SO THAT WE

02:07:45.424 --> 02:07:48.694
DON'T END UP HAVING.

02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:50.929
TO RESTORE THEM WE DON'T END UP

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:53.732
HAVING -- TO THE TOW HAVE THEM

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:54.633
ATONE FOR THE MISTAKES THAT THEY

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.001
MADE BUT I DO WE NOT MAKE THE

02:07:56.068 --> 02:07:57.169
MISTAKES.

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.670
IN THE FIRST PLACE WILL BE

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.539
ASSISTED OUT OF THAT SO I THIS

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:03.242
IS THIS IS INTERESTING WILL WILL

02:08:03.308 --> 02:08:04.676
ABSOLUTELY SEE WHERE THIS GUY

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:05.778
WAS AND THEY HAD. ONE THAT I'M

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:07.112
HOPING THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE.

02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:08.781
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT THERE'S A

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:11.016
LOT MORE TO DO HERE THAT I THINK

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:12.017
ARE JUST.

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:18.290
LOOKING AT THIS -- FIRST BLUSH.

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:22.361
COMMENTS IN THE AUDIENCE ELEVEN

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:24.563
FROM WELL I'M SORRY.

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:25.531
JONES SAWYER.

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:27.232
AND I AND I HAVE A CONCERN TO

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:29.168
ANNA AND I HOPE -- BECAUSE I

02:08:29.234 --> 02:08:30.002
READ THIS IS THIS KIND OF HAS

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:31.236
THE SAME CHALLENGE I HAD.

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.372
WITH THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION.

02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:35.340
THAT I GOT.

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:36.008
FOR FOR ACES TRUMP FORM CARE THE

02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:37.176
BUREAUCRACY.

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:38.577
IN THEIR MYOPIC VIEW OF HOW YOU

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:40.045
DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T GET

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:41.580
OUT OF THEIR WAY.

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:43.015
AND THIS KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:45.117
THAT AT THE YOU KNOW I AND I

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:46.485
HOPE YOU'RE NOT WEDDED TO THIS.

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:47.986
CRADDICK DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:49.555
COMMUNITY RESTORATION BECAUSE

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:51.156
THAT KIND OF CAPS LATE WHAT THE

02:08:51.223 --> 02:08:52.724
PROBLEM IS.

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:55.527
AND EVEN AS I READ THROUGH HERE --

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:56.995
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING I

02:08:57.062 --> 02:08:58.397
DON'T KNOW WHAT.

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:00.599
THE HECK THAT MEANS BUT I DO

02:09:00.666 --> 02:09:02.301
KNOW WHEN I'VE TALKED TO

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:04.336
FORMALLY INCARCERATED.

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:06.371
AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS

02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:08.307
THEY TALK ABOUT TRAUMA.

02:09:08.373 --> 02:09:09.441
GET THE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:10.809
WERE YOUNG YOUNGER.

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:13.045
AND AND HOW THAT LED THEM INTO

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:14.980
THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:15.981
AND THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE

02:09:16.048 --> 02:09:17.516
THERE THAT DEALT WITH THAT

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:19.151
TRAUMA AND IF THEY HAD SOMEONE

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:20.752
JUST DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.154
ALONE.

02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:24.556
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE HELP

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:26.425
IN THE BE ABLE.

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:28.393
TO READ EFFECTIVELY BEEN REDUCED

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.529
RATE LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO DO MATH

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:31.930

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:33.665
KIND OF TAKE FOR GRANTED.

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:37.769
AND I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.538
DELVE INTO.

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.373
THE PSYCHE OF WHAT GETS ME TOO

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.709
YOUNG PEOPLE IN A BECAUSE WE

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:44.243
KEEP IGNORING IT.

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:46.011
ALL OF THESE BASIC PROGRAMS

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:48.814
WON'T MEAN ANYTHING -- AND EVEN

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.582
SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW FIRST AID

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:53.285
AND CPR CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVEL

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:54.153
TRAINING.

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:58.724
OSHA TRAINING -- I I DIDN'T.

02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:00.092
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:01.593
WHERE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:02.861
MAYBE EVEN GETTING THEM TO

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:04.730
COLLEGE OR TRYING TO GET THEM

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:05.397
INTO A?

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:07.432
BUT A REAL TRADE OR EVEN TRYING

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:10.636
TO GET THEM INTO THE COMPUTER

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:11.637
ENGINE SO WHERE LEARNING CODING.

02:10:11.703 --> 02:10:13.405
SO THEY CAN GOAL OF IT BEYOND

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:13.705
[inaudible]

02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:15.174
JUST.

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.809
SUPERFICIAL MENIAL BANKS AND

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.378
PASSED AND SO -- I'M I'M HOPING

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:20.946
THAT.

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:21.947
YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU NEED

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:24.183
MISTER STONE IN MY HELP WE CAN

WE CALL SOME NAMES OF THE

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:28.120
DEPARTMENT.

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:30.923
I THINK WILL BE A LITTLE MORE.

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:31.223
UPLIFTING.

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:32.457

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:36.528
SYSTEM.

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:38.297

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.898

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:19.825
THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:13:19.891 --> 02:13:20.926
CURRENT SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:23.095
PROMISED AT THAT -- THAT WE ARE

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:25.263
COMMITTED TO ENDING THE JUVENILE

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:26.732
JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW WHAT

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:27.933
ONCE AND FOR ALL THOSE ARE THE

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.601
WORDS OF OUR GOVERNOR AND THAT'S

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:31.303
A REALLY GOOD STATEMENT.

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:32.971
THAT'S THERE I THINK IT TAKES A

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.806
LOT MORE TIME TO DO THAN WHAT

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.508
WE'VE HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF TIME

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:40.879
TO DO IT -- I AM CONCERNED AS

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:42.547
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO MENTION.

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:43.682
THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS

02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:44.983
TO BE THE LATEST AND GREATEST BY

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.151
AT THAT WE DO.

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:47.252
AND WE DID IT WITH THE SAME

02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:49.054
RESULTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:50.722
IS MOVE FROM YOU KNOW A ROOM

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:52.057
THAT'S NOW BROWN AND TURNED IT

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:53.759
INTO A ROOM THAT'S PINK OR

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:55.227
GREATER ORANGE OR SOMETHING.

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:58.330
IN THAT SENSE THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:13:58.397 --> 02:13:59.831
LATCHED ON TO THINGS THAT ARE

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:00.832
OUT THERE WITHOUT REALLY

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:02.667
CAREFULLY ANALYZING WHAT WE'RE

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:03.769
DOING.

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.504
I DON'T HAVE A VISION AT THIS

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:06.905
POINT AND I'M AND I DON'T STILL

02:14:06.972 --> 02:14:08.707
DON'T SEE A VISION OTHER THAN

02:14:08.774 --> 02:14:10.342
WORDS BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE.

02:14:10.409 --> 02:14:11.743
A CLEAR VISION OF WHERE WE'RE

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.311
GOING WITH THIS WHAT IS GOING TO

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:15.580
LOOK LIKE -- WE HAD SOME OF THE

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.349
ADVOCATES COME IN BEFORE AND

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:19.151
THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT.

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:20.051
A NUMBER OF THINGS AND THEY ARE

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:21.620
UP TO THEY ARE BASED AT ONE

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:23.355
POINT OPTIMISTIC AND SKEPTICAL

02:14:23.422 --> 02:14:24.756
AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I THINK

02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:25.991
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH LIKE MOST

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:26.958
FOLKS HAVE.

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:28.493
A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT CHANGES

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:29.628
YOU KNOW COMES IN AND YOU'RE

02:14:29.694 --> 02:14:31.029
GOING TO DO THIS FOR US IS THAT

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:32.497
AND YOU CHANGE THE BUILDING.

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:33.965
IN TERMS OF MEN NOT MAKING LOOKS

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.901
SO MUCH LIKE A PRISON OR YOU

02:14:35.967 --> 02:14:36.601
CHANGE THIS YOU.

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:38.937
THAT AND IN THE END THE RESULTS

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:40.539
OF THE SAME STILL NOT MEETING

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:42.140
THE NEEDS OF KIDS WERE STILL

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:42.974
SEEING HIGH LEVEL OF RECIDIVISM

02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:43.875
WE'RE STILL SEEING A JUVENILE

02:14:43.942 --> 02:14:45.343
JUSTICE PROGRAM BASICALLY BEING

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:47.379
THE PIPELINE TO THE HARDCORE

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:52.250
PRISONS OR WHATEVER MAYBE.

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:53.785
SO I'M LOOKING.

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:54.386
FOR A PLAN OF WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:55.287
TO DO I'M NOT SURE WE'VE

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:56.321
MENTIONED WE WANT TO USE OUR

02:14:56.388 --> 02:14:56.755
ADVOCATES WE WANT.

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.190
TO BRING THEM INTO THE PROCESS

02:14:58.256 --> 02:14:59.891
AND AND YET I DON'T SEE A WAY IN

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:00.926
WHICH THEY'RE BEING.

02:15:00.992 --> 02:15:02.594
TRULY INCORPORATED IN THE

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:04.396
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ON

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:07.232
AN ONGOING BASIS -- IT SEEMS TO

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:09.501
ME IF I WERE GOING -- TO CHANGE

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:12.137
A SYSTEM AS LARGE AS THIS.

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:14.005
AND AS IMPORTANT AS THIS.

02:15:14.072 --> 02:15:15.707
I WOULD BE PLANNING IT ON A

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:17.075
REGULAR BASIS MORE THAN FROM

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:19.311
JUST FROM JANUARY TO WHAT IS

02:15:19.377 --> 02:15:20.345
THIS MAY.

02:15:20.412 --> 02:15:22.080
OF MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS TO

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:23.381
CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:25.717
I THINK THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:27.853
THINGS THAT -- THE THAT I'VE

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:29.721
SEEN IN TERMS OF THE JUVENILE

02:15:29.788 --> 02:15:32.357
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN -- THAT

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:33.959
HAVE TAKEN TIME IN TERMS OF

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:35.994
TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY IN TERMS

02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:37.762
OF OF WHAT OUR VISION IS WHAT

02:15:37.829 --> 02:15:39.130
THE KIDS SHOULD BE DOING WHAT IT

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.098
SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:42.934
BUT ALSO WHO SHOULD BE DOING IT.

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:44.069
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THOSE

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:45.437
THERE'S A WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

02:15:45.504 --> 02:15:46.805
THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO SIMPLY

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:48.673
SHIFT THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES INTO

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.842
THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO THE NEW

02:15:50.909 --> 02:15:51.076
SYSTEM.

02:15:51.142 --> 02:15:52.410
AND MOVE ON FROM THERE AND THAT

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:53.478
COULD BE THE WORST THING IF WE

02:15:53.545 --> 02:15:55.080
BUILT A SYSTEM AROUND CURRENT

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:56.715
EMPLOYEES NOT THAT CORN

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:58.650
EMPLOYEES ARE BAD BUT WHEN YOU

02:15:58.717 --> 02:16:00.151
SOMETIMES CHANGING THE SYSTEM.

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:02.120
THE RECOGNITION COMES REAL SOON

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:03.355
IS THAT.

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:04.289
CAN THESE FOLKS ACTUALLY

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:05.790
IMPLEMENT A NEW SYSTEM THAT THEY

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:07.559
ARE SO COMMITTED TO THE OLD

02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:08.727
SYSTEM ABOUT DOING.

02:16:08.793 --> 02:16:09.961
AND AND IS IT JUST WINDOW

02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:10.962
DRESSING WAS IT REALLY

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:13.465
SUBSTANTIVE IN TERMS OF CHANGE

02:16:13.532 --> 02:16:14.332
SO.

02:16:14.399 --> 02:16:15.033
I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.401
RECOMMENDATION IS GOING TO BE

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:17.702
BUT I CAN ENVISION SOMETHING

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:19.070
THAT HAS MORE OF AN ADVISORY

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:20.672
COMMITTEE THAT WORKS ON THIS

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:22.007
PROBLEM FOR US.

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.675
IT REALLY GETS US TO DO IT RIGHT

02:16:23.742 --> 02:16:25.377
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IF

02:16:25.443 --> 02:16:26.545
WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT.

02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:28.113
THEN WE COMMIT OURSELVES FOR

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:30.248
WHATEVER CRAZY REASON THE WAY WE

02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:32.183
FEEL. TO DOING IT AS TO THE

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.084
LEVEL WAS YOU YOU PROBABLY HER

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:34.486
WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:36.688
MONEY ON A PAINT IN THIS ROOM SO

02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:37.756
LET'S JUST KEEP RIGHT YOU KNOW

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:39.558
IS UGLY BUT WE LIKE IT ANYWAY

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:40.959
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS BEEN OUR MONEY

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:41.426
ON IT.

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:44.095
SO YOU DON'T HAVE BEEN.

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:44.829
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN STEPPING

02:16:44.896 --> 02:16:45.797
BACK AND SAID I DON'T CARE HOW

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:49.901
MUCH WE SPENT ON IT WE GOT TO

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:51.169
MAKE SOME CHANGES AND SO.

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:51.703
I I WANT US TO BE I'M NOT

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:52.304
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.639
REALLY VERY DEEPLY THOUGHTFUL

02:16:54.706 --> 02:16:55.273
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.141
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY

02:16:56.207 --> 02:16:57.375
COLLEAGUES ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:16:57.442 --> 02:16:59.311
WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT CHANGING

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.046
AS WELL EXCITED ABOUT.

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.514
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:04.349
OUR KIDS AND AND IT AND IT

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:06.384
REALLY IS -- AND I'VE SEEN

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:07.686
THINGS AS I POINTED OUT LAST

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.220
TIME I I I WENT TO A JUVENILE

02:17:09.287 --> 02:17:10.555
JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GHANA AND IT

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:12.924
WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN HERE.

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:15.594
AND BASED ON THE VALUES OF THAT

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:18.063
COUNTRY AND IT'S PERSPECTIVE OF

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:19.531
YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES AND

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:21.299
AND LOOKING AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:22.867
AS REALLY A REFLECTION.

02:17:22.934 --> 02:17:25.503
OF THEIR VALUE SYSTEM GOING AWRY

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.139
YOU KNOW THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:29.374
THEY BELIEVE THAT AT CERTAIN AT

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:31.343
BURKE CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN AND

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:32.711
FROM HERE GOES TO HEAR AND GO

02:17:32.777 --> 02:17:33.011
SIT THERE.

02:17:33.078 --> 02:17:34.379
AND AND AND AND THE FAMILY

02:17:34.446 --> 02:17:36.147
PARTICIPATES IN THIS PROCESS SO

02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:38.116
WHEN THEY LOOK AT SOMETHING AS A

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:39.484
THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD.

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.285
WHO'S STEALING SOMETHING OR

02:17:40.352 --> 02:17:41.953
WHATEVER THEY ARE SAYING TO

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:43.855
THEMSELVES WE'RE IN THIS PROCESS

02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:45.023
OF WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.925
DID WE GO WRONG AND HOW DO WE GO

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:48.627
BACK AND REPAIR THAT PROCESS.

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:49.694
HOW DO WE INCORPORATE THOSE KIDS

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.062
IN THE FAMILIES INTO THIS

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:52.897
PROCESS AND SO THERE'S A SO

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.366
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU WALK INTO A

02:17:54.432 --> 02:17:54.899
TO SEE A DIFFERENT PROCESS

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:56.067
TAKING PLACE?

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:57.736
YOU SEE A REAL DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:17:57.802 --> 02:17:58.837
REUNIFICATION IT IS A DIFFERENT

02:17:58.903 --> 02:18:00.672
KIND OF REFLECTION ON FAMILY AND

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:01.806
PEOPLE SO.

02:18:01.873 --> 02:18:02.741
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.476
HOW WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WHAT

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:06.144
WE REALLY NEED TO BE DOING IN

02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:07.278
THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIQUE

02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:08.446
OPPORTUNITY.

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.381
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:10.915
SQUANDERED BECAUSE SIMPLY WE

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:12.050
JUST MOVE KIDS FROM.

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:13.418
MOVE THE DESIGNATION IN OTHER

02:18:13.485 --> 02:18:15.487
WORDS THE THE THE THE NUMBERS WE

02:18:15.553 --> 02:18:17.255
HAVE WHEN WEGET PAID MAYBE YOU

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:18.923
YOU'RE NOW IT YOU KNOW THE ONE

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.792
OLE OLE SEVEN FIVE IS THE NUMBER

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:21.993
THAT YOU HAVE NOW YOU HAVE ONE

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.261
OLD.

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:25.230
SEVEN EIGHT OKAY AND AS A RESULT

02:18:25.296 --> 02:18:26.698
NOT YOU CHECK COMES FROM THIS

02:18:26.765 --> 02:18:28.066
GROUP DOES THAT GROUP AND WE'RE

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:28.667
DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:29.768
OVER SO.

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.403
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT VERY

02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:33.438
MUCH SO NOT CONCERNED ABOUT YOU

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:35.240
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH.

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:36.508
THE PROCESS IS WHETHER NOW WE'VE

02:18:36.574 --> 02:18:38.276
ACTUALLY BEEN THOUGHTFUL IN THE

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.110
PROCESS AND WHAT WOULD HAVE

02:18:39.177 --> 02:18:41.312
ENOUGH TIME. TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:43.581
THE PROCESS AND I DON'T WANT TO

02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:45.417
MAKE. TOO MANY COMMITMENTS TOO

02:18:45.483 --> 02:18:47.919
SOON BECAUSE IF YOU DO WITHOUT

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:49.421
THAT THEN WEEK WE'RE COMMITTED

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:50.021
TO THAT.

02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:51.156
AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES WITH

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:53.191
THE SYSTEM GOES ON AND ON AND ON

02:18:53.258 --> 02:18:54.392
UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT IT'S WRONG.

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:55.894
AND THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.529

ONGOING JOURNEY.

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:12.103
IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF A

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.005
JOURNEY AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:14.072 --> 02:20:15.306
AND PAST ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:17.408
INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE

02:20:17.475 --> 02:20:18.409
REFORM OF DJJ.

02:20:18.476 --> 02:20:20.044
AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THERE

02:20:20.111 --> 02:20:20.612
HAS BEEN A LOT OF MONEY IN

02:20:20.678 --> 02:20:22.180
DEVELOPING THE INTEGRATED

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:26.718
BEHAVIOR TREATMENT MODEL WHICH

02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:27.585

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:28.586
WITH ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF

02:20:28.653 --> 02:20:29.187
OTHER COLLEAGUES.

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:30.722
THAT HAS DEVELOPED.

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:32.724
OUR CAPACITY UPON WHICH WE NEED

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:34.759
TO BUILD TO ADDRESS THE ADVERSE

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.060
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IN THE

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:39.097
TRAUMAS IN THE ISSUES UNDERLYING --

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:40.698

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:43.067
AND THAT.

02:20:43.134 --> 02:20:45.770
THE MOVE THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE IT

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:49.474
JOURNEY TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:50.909
CAN FURTHER REINFORCING DOUBLE

02:20:50.975 --> 02:20:52.310
DOWN OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

ADDRESS THOSE UNDERLYING NEEDS.

02:20:55.647 --> 02:20:56.714
AND THE SECOND PART OF THE

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.883
JOURNEY WHICH WAS NOT PART OF

02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:01.085
THE THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:02.387
FOR A LAWSUIT IS IS THIS NEW

02:21:02.453 --> 02:21:03.988

SAY THIS IMPRESSIVE YEAH THE

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:16.000
CUTTING EDGE THERE BECAUSE IT IS

COMES IN JUST A HANDFUL OF

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:24.509
DEFICITS BUT SOME STRENGTH

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:25.944
BECAUSE OF ADVERSE EXPERIENCES

02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:27.879
CAN YOU KNOW SOCIAL ECONOMICAL

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:28.947

UPBRINGING.

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:30.648
THE STRING TWENTY WILL BE BUILT

02:21:30.715 --> 02:21:32.317

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:45.496
THE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS IN IN

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:46.898
ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICES.

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:48.466
HAS BEEN A PRINCIPAL PART OF OF

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:49.734
SOME OF THESE OTHER PROPOSAL

AND HOUSE OF ENHANCEMENT AND

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:01.813
BUILDING UPON -- THE DISTANCE WE

HAVE COME SO FAR SURE THE NEXT

02:22:03.748 --> 02:22:05.149
PART OF THAT JOURNEY AND OF

02:22:05.216 --> 02:22:06.050
COURSE WE'RE GONNA REACH OUT

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:07.118
INVOLVED THE STAKEHOLDERS MANY

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:07.752
OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:08.686
SERVICES.

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:11.956
IN DJJ TODAY AND I THINK THAT --

A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU

02:22:13.558 --> 02:22:15.593

WOW.

THIS IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN DJJ

02:22:22.066 --> 02:22:22.533
OF THE PAST WHAT IS NOT

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:23.134
DIFFERENT ENOUGH IN TERMS OF

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:23.801
WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND WE THINK

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:24.402
THAT THIS IS GOING TO ADVANCE

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:26.304
THAT JOURNEY SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:26.905
LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO

02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:28.706

WELL WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:35.146

WHAT THE RESULTS ARE WHERE YOU

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:40.985
ARE IN THE PROCESS I THINK

02:22:41.052 --> 02:22:42.854
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:43.121

AND MOST OF US HAVE BEEN LOOKING

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:52.563
FOR THE FULL BLOWN.

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:55.099
DOCUMENT OR PLAN OR WHATEVER IT

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:57.769
OTHER THINGS.

02:22:57.835 --> 02:22:59.570
BUT BUT I THINK IT'S VERY

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.939
IMPORTANT I LIKE I SAID AND I

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:02.840
THINK IT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL IT

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:04.542
TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ALL IN

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.945

IT CAN'T HAPPEN HAS TO HAPPEN

02:23:10.748 --> 02:23:15.453
OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE --

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.321
AND WE'RE GOING TO BETTER BUDGET

02:23:16.387 --> 02:23:16.888
BUT NOT ONLY THE JUVENILE

02:23:16.955 --> 02:23:17.522
JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THE OVERALL

02:23:17.588 --> 02:23:19.991
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- NCDC

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:22.560
ART EVERYBODY ELSE BUT OF SO I

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:23.661
THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT AT

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.538
BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF NEXT

02:23:33.604 --> 02:23:35.306
YEAR SESSION TO GET A SENSE OF

02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:36.774

WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SAY OKAY

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:51.289

SEE THAT ENGAGEMENT OF THE

02:23:58.296 --> 02:23:59.731
VARIOUS AGENCIES AND A

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.399

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:04.202
THE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE

02:24:04.268 --> 02:24:05.636
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:07.005
THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:07.872
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:12.110
THERE IS THAT WE ALL WANT TO

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:13.478

HIGH.

02:24:31.863 --> 02:24:33.398

IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

WE KEEP THOSE -- POSITIONS IN

02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:14.058

DISHONEST CORRUPT CRIMINAL

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.901
ELEMENT OUT OF THE GAMBLING

ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE SHARE

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:29.974
AND WHICH I WERE DEPARTMENT OF

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:32.476
FINANCE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT --

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:33.611
LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:35.646
BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL IS --

02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:37.215
KIND OF DIFFICULT -- HE'S

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.449
POSITIONS IT TAKES AWHILE TO ON

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:40.251
BOARD THEM TO HIRE THEM ANYTIME

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:41.619
YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME TERM

02:27:41.686 --> 02:27:42.954
FUNDING -- THERE'S ALWAYS A

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.355
CHANCE PEOPLE ARE GONNA FIND

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:45.957
ANOTHER JOB AND IT TAKES IT

02:27:46.023 --> 02:27:47.758
TAKES AWHILE FOR THEM SO THAT'S

02:27:47.825 --> 02:27:49.460
WHY THIS PROPOSAL IS ONGOING --

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:50.728
FUNDING THERE'S ALSO PROVISIONAL

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:52.163
LANGUAGE HAS PROPOSED THAT

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:54.298
ALLOWS FINANCE -- UPON APPROVAL

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:56.534
BY THE JAIL BC TO AUGMENT OR

02:27:56.601 --> 02:27:57.969
REDUCE THE BUDGET AS NEEDED

02:27:58.035 --> 02:28:04.275
BASED ON WORKLOAD NEEDS AS WELL.

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:05.409
COMING FROM LA OKAY I NEED ONLY

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:05.943
WHAT THEY ALEJO -- WE ARE

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.011
RECOMMENDING -- PROVIDING ONE

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:08.412
TIME FUNDING TO JUST RETAIN THE

02:28:08.479 --> 02:28:09.747
POSITIONS AND PART OF THE

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:11.182
RATIONALE FOR THAT IS THAT THE

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:13.217
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR IS AND

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:14.819
TOWARDS THE END OF COMPLETING AN

02:28:14.885 --> 02:28:15.353
AUDIT.

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:17.154
OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES

02:28:17.221 --> 02:28:18.422
FROM THE GAME THE CONTROL FUND

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:20.424
WHICH SUPPORTS THIS WORKLOAD AND

02:28:20.491 --> 02:28:22.260
PART OF THE SCOPE INCLUDE SOME

02:28:22.326 --> 02:28:23.828
THINGS THAT ARE CORE TO KIND OF

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.696
AN OUT ANALYZING THE WORKLOAD SO

02:28:25.763 --> 02:28:26.831
FOR EXAMPLE.

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:28.799
THEY ARE REVIEWING -- THE

02:28:28.866 --> 02:28:30.568
OVERALL PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW

02:28:30.635 --> 02:28:32.136
EFFICIENT THE PROCESSES WHETHER

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.804
THE STATUTORY TIME FRAMES ARE

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.539
BEING THAT AS WELL AS WHETHER OR

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.441
NOT THERE IS A BACKLOG AND WHAT

02:28:37.508 --> 02:28:38.843
ARE THE CAUSES OF THAT BACKLOG.

02:28:38.909 --> 02:28:40.311
AND SO PROVIDING -- FUNDING ON A

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:42.213
LIMITED HER BASIS WOULD ALLOW

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:43.381
BOTH THE BUREAU AND THE

02:28:43.447 --> 02:28:45.016
LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THOSE

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:46.851
RECOMMENDATIONS AND KIND OF

02:28:46.917 --> 02:28:47.685
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LONG TERM

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:48.352
IPACT.

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:50.121
OF THOSE COULD BE SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:28:50.187 --> 02:28:52.089
IT COULD INVOLVE CHANGES TO THE

02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:53.591
OVERALL PROCESS ARE KIND OF IT

02:28:53.658 --> 02:28:55.159
IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT'S DONE THE

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:56.560
TIME FRAME EXCITER AND SO THAT

02:28:56.627 --> 02:29:02.667
COULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS ON ON

02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:05.269
GOING NEED FOR FUNDING AND STUFF.

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:07.271
RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

02:29:07.338 --> 02:29:09.874
BECOMES FOR MEMBERS.

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.309
IS THE ONE FROM THE AUDIENCE.

02:29:11.375 --> 02:29:12.243
JUST VERY QUICKLY THIS OF THE

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:13.611
AUDIT WILL BE RELEASED TOMORROW

02:29:13.678 --> 02:29:15.513
MORNING ACTUALLY SO THAT.

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:16.480
WE CAN GET AN IDEA THAN WE CAN

02:29:16.547 --> 02:29:17.014
SPEAK TO IT BECAUSE IT'S

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:20.051
CONFIDENTIAL BUT CERTAINLY THERE

02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:22.119
ARE THINGS THAT IT WAS FOR THE

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:23.054
THE REJECTED THE BUREAU'S

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:24.555
LOOKING AT CERTAINLY TO INCREASE

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:25.756
EFFICIENCIES BUT I THINK IT'S

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:27.058
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- WE

02:29:27.124 --> 02:29:27.658
BELIEVE THAT I MEAN NOT JUST

02:29:27.725 --> 02:29:28.592
THESE THREE TWO POSITIONS BUT

02:29:28.659 --> 02:29:29.994
POTENTIALLY WE WOULD NEED MORE

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:31.329
POSITIONS JUST TO HANDLE 

02:29:31.395 --> 02:29:33.364
CURRENT ONGOING WORKLOAD THE

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:34.432
KIND OF THE ANNUAL WORKLOAD THAT

02:29:34.498 --> 02:29:37.134
WE GET -- SO -- WE DO THINK THE

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:38.736
PERMANENT FUNDING ALSO WAS

02:29:38.803 --> 02:29:40.471
FINANCE SAID HAVING THE HAVING

02:29:40.538 --> 02:29:42.740
THE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE HIRING --

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:43.808
WE ARE IN THE VISION LAW

02:29:43.874 --> 02:29:45.343
ENFORCEMENT IT IS AN EXTENDED

02:29:45.409 --> 02:29:46.711
HIRING PROCESS.

02:29:46.777 --> 02:29:48.879
AND THEN IT'S USUALLY LIKE A SIX

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:49.647
MONTH PROCESS JUST TO GET

02:29:49.714 --> 02:29:50.848
SOMEONE.

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:52.083
UP -- SIX MONTHS FOR THE HARRY

02:29:52.149 --> 02:29:53.351
BUT SIX MONTHS ALSO JUST TO GET

02:29:53.417 --> 02:29:54.952
THEM -- UP TO SPEED TO BE ABLE

02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:56.587
TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD SO HAVING

02:29:56.654 --> 02:29:57.922
PEOPLE BE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR

02:29:57.988 --> 02:29:59.490
POSITIONS AND LEAVING IT TAKES A

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:01.025
LONG TIME TO GET US BACK UP TO

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:02.059
SPEED AGAIN SO.

02:30:02.126 --> 02:30:03.294
THAT'S ALSO CONSENT -- IT'S

02:30:03.361 --> 02:30:04.795
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:30:04.862 --> 02:30:06.964
TEMPORARY HIRING ARE YOU YOUR

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:08.032
MONEY FUNNY AND SO AS A RESULT

02:30:08.099 --> 02:30:09.533
IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO THE

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:15.639
STATE WE'VE HAD THAT WITH OTHER

02:30:15.706 --> 02:30:16.040
AGENCIES AS WELL.

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:17.108
YEAH.

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:18.242
PRESENTING PARK WEST CASINOS BUT

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:19.710
ALSO SPEAKING IF YOU WILL WAS A

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:20.378
AS A FORMER CHIEF DEPUTY

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:21.412
ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM

02:30:21.479 --> 02:30:22.380
PREHISTORIC TIMES WHO USED.

02:30:22.446 --> 02:30:23.848
TO MANAGE THIS -- WHEN IT WAS A

02:30:23.914 --> 02:30:25.683
DIVISION AS WELL AND I CAN TELL

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:27.985
YOU THAT HAVING SUCH A?

02:30:28.052 --> 02:30:29.353
SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF A

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:31.489
RELATIVELY SMALL WORKFORCE BEING

02:30:31.555 --> 02:30:34.158
LIMITED TERM FOR AS LONG AS

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:36.093
THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN -- IS

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.028
REALLY A BIG BURDEN ON THE REST

02:30:38.095 --> 02:30:38.996
OF MANAGEMENT AND GETTING THE
