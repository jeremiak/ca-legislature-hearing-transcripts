SENATOR GLAZERS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR GLAZERS AN ACT RELATING TO BLOOD BANKS SENATOR GLAZERS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MORNING MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. TODAY AND HERE PERCENT SB FOURTEEN THIRTY FIVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE A REGISTERED NURSE TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT. OR AVAILABLE VIA TELEHEALTH FOR BLOOD DONATIONS. TATIAN WHY BLOOD CENTERS ARE FACING A BLOOD CRISIS THE WORST BLOOD SHORTAGE IN OVER A DECADE. DOCTORS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHO RECEIVED. WHO RECEIVED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS UNTIL MORE PRODUCT BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS. HARBOR UCLA MEDICAL CENTER. A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY CLOSED ITS TRAUMA CENTER FOR TWO HOURS. BECAUSE OF RANDOM BLOOD FOR PATIENTS. IN ADDITION THOUSANDS OF BLOOD DONATIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE LOST EACH YEAR. AS A RESULT OF BLOOD DRIVES CANCELED. AT THE LAST MINUTE TO. DUE TO NURSING STAFF CHALLENGES. TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTAGE DURING THE PANDEMIC THE BLOOD BANKS RELY TO DEVIATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE REGISTERED NURSE TO BE AVAILABLE ON SITE. WHEN A REGISTERED NURSE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BE ON SITE. COVERAGE OF THAT BLOOD DRIVE OFF A CO OPERATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH TELEHEALTH. BASED ON DATA FROM THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. ROUGHLY FOUREEN HUNDRED BLOOD DRIVE OPERATIONS COLLECTED ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND RED CELLS AND EIGHT THOUSAND. MICHAEL IT'S USUALLY UTILIZING OUR AND TELEHEALTH SUPPORT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FOR LACK OF NURSE AVAILABILITY. DATA ALSO SHOWS THE DONOR SAFETY WAS NOT IMPACTED DURING THESE BLOOD DRIVES. THIS BILL WOULD DO A COUPLE THINGS ONE IT WOULD ENSURE THAT BLOOD IS COLLECTED SAFELY UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OR THE PERSON- OR THE TELEHEALTH NURSE. TO WOULD PROVIDE FOR INCREASED ACCESS AND RURAL COUNTIES THREE WOULD PROVIDE FOR INCREASED AMOUNT OF BLOOD DURING CRITICAL PERIODS AND FINALLY IT WOULD REDUCE COSTS TO BLOOD BANKS. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT OF. SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU NOT A PRESS I STAND AS A CO AUTHOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB FORTY THIRTY FIVE AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN BLOOD DONATIONS WHICH HAS RESULTED IN CRITICAL SHORTAGES IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATUS THE AUTHORS NOTED THE MODEL PROPOSED BY S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY FIVE HAS BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE OVER LAST TWO YEARS UNDER CDPH REGULATION VARIANTS. SB FORTY SEVEN FIVE WOULD CODIFY THE PRACTICE INTO LAW PROVIDING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR GENEROUS BLOOD DONORS ENABLING GREATER FLEXIBILITY WHILE MAINTAINING SUPPLIES OF BLOOD BANKS AND HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY. SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT% I ALSO I'M A CO AUTHOR AN URGENT AYE VOTE THIS MORNING ON SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE SAN DIEGO RED CROSS AND GIVE SEVERAL PLATELET DONATIONS MYSELF AND A HOST- BLOOD MOBILES AT MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND HAVE HAD A GREAT RESULT OF THAT AND HOPE EVERYBODY WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. CENTER DOLLY. THE EMAIL PRESENT MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT FOR RULE COUNTIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE- CONDITIONS AVAILABLE THIS WILL REALLY RAMP UP THE ABILITY BILL TO GET MORE- DONOR SO I TOTALLY THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THOSE AREAS OUT THERE AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THAT EVERY TIME THAT YOU DONATE BLOOD YOU SAVE THREE LIVES AND IT'S JUST AWESOME THING TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SO I SURPRISE SUPPORTER. SB FIVE. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER GLAZER YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU I JUST THANK BY CO AUTHORS FOR THEIR SUPPORT- MEMBERS THIS IS PERMISSIVE IT GIVES EACH BLOOD BANK AND WHEREVER THEY'RE LOCATED IN THE STATE THE OPTION.

SHE IS PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL NINE SIXTY BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH JOHN MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB NINE SIXTY. BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ON PERSONNEL. OPEN IT UP TO THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE OPENED UP TO SERVING AS A MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA BAR A DOCTOR SERVING IN THE MILITARY OR MOST OF OUR PROFESSIONAL LICENSES NOW WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN NONCITIZEN RESIDENTS WHO HAVE FULL LEGAL WORK STATUS. SO THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY VETTED THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN FEDERAL WORK STATUS AND SO IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER PROFESSION THAT EXISTS THEY CAN FULLY WORK INCLUDING AS I MENTIONED SERVING IN OUR MILITARY. BUT BECAUSE OF ONE COUPLE WORDS IN CALIFORNIA'S STATUTE THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND AS I THINK MOST OF US KNOW. WE HAVE MANY OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE OTHER AGENCIES ARE THEY HAVE A LOT OF RETIREMENTS COMING UP JUST DEMOGRAPHICALLY WERE YOU KNOW OUR POPULATION IS CHANGING THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME RECRUITING THERE'S A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE AND YET WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO AND THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHO BROUGHT THIS TO MY ATTENTION THEY HAD GROWN STUDENTS THAT GRADUATED FROM UC THAT WANTED TO ATTEND THEIR ACADEMY AND TRY TO BE PART OF THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WERE EXCLUDED. THEY OTHERWISE HAD FULL WORK STATUS BUT THEY WERE EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF THIS IS A STATUTE THAT EXISTS. NOW. EVEN IF YOU HAVE A PENDING CITIZEN APPLICATION YOUR EXCLUDE AND WE KNOW NOW THAT IT CAN TAKE YEARS FOR YOU PER CITIZEN APPLICATION TO BE PROCESSED THE FEDERAL BACKLOG OF APPLICATIONS TO BECOME A CITIZEN MORE THAN DOUBLED BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN THEIR QUEUE. AND THE WAIT TIME IS ALSO INCREASED SO IT SOME FOLKS ARE WAITING UP TO A DECADE TO GET THEIR CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION FULLY PROCESSED IN GRANTED. SO I FEEL THAT GIVEN THAT WE ALLOW THIS SAME CATEGORY PEOPLE TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY TO SERVE AND SO MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO DENY A PERSON WHO IS OTHERWISE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO WORK FROM SERVING AS A PEACE OFFICER. ON AND WITH THAT BY APPLE LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT STILL REQUIRES ALL OTHER RIGOROUS STANDARDS THAT WE REQUIRE. IF YOU ARE TO BECOME PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE HIRING AGENCIES CAN STILL DO FULL BACKGROUND IN CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECKS AND OF COURSE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A LEGAL WORK AUTHORIZATION YOUR ALREADY VETTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU DO NOT GET SUCH WORK AUTHORIZATION. SUCH ABUSE OR OTHER WITHOUT FULL VETTING. BUT STILL ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ABLE TO PUT EVERY OTHER CRITERIA. THE PERSON MUST BE DEEMED GOOD MORAL CHARACTER THEY MUST GO THROUGH POST TRAINING ALL OF THE REST SO I ASK THAT YOU JOIN OUR POLICE CHIEFS. OUR UNIVERSITIES AND SO MANY OTHERS AND A LINE CALIFORNIA STATES LIKE WEST VIRGINIA COLORADO VERMONT AND ILLINOIS IN MAKING THIS CHANGE. SENATOR GONZALEZ THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT I TOO WANT TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ACTUALLY WAS APPROACHED BY MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT BACK HOME IN LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH HERMOSA BEACH WHO WERE- PLEADING TO GET THIS BILL ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOT JUST IN THE RECRUITING AND NOT HAVING LACK OF OFFICERS BUT THEY ALSO THE DAY DIVERSE CITY I'M ASPECTS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- IF THEY'RE ABLE TO FIGHT IN A WAR WHY CAN'T THEY HELP US ON OUR STREETS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE THAT WE'RE ALL SAFE. AND SO I HOPE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I THINK ON THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE WE GET THIS RIGHT OF FOR PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS REALLY WANT TO SERVE. ARE ABLE TO SERVE THANK YOU. SENATOR NELSON. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS I DON'T OFTEN DISAGREE WITH THE POLICE CHIEF. BUT I DO ON THIS ONE. I KNOW THERE DESPERATE NOW. TOO FEW PEOPLE SIX DEBATERS LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHY. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE A NON FICTION. THROUGHOUT THIS NATION OF CONDEMNING THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. SPENDING THEIR FACED. THIS LEGISLATORS VOTED ON LEGISLATION TO DO THAT VERY THING. LEGISLATION THAT IS PUT NAMES ON THAT PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL ACROSS THE STREET. SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT NOW. AND INDEED ALL OF THE PEACE OFFICER MAGAZINES ARE FILLED WITH ADVERTISEMENTS. ASKING PEOPLE TO COME TO WORK AND APPLY IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS. SO THERE IS A DARTH A GOOD CANDIDATES. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THOUGH WE'RE DEALING WITH THE CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE CUSTODIANS ARE FRENCH. BUT WITH THIS LEGISLATION. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT EVEN CITIZENS. INDIVIDUALS WHO WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO CONFIRM THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORIES IF THEY HAD ANY AND- WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM. ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS OR ANYTHING. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT IMPERATIVES THE BE ASSURED UP. SO I WOULDN'T ALLOW THAT THE SENATE SHOULD LACKS QUESTIONS ON THIS LEGISLATION AND I URGE A NO VOTE MADAM CHAIR I RISE IN SUPPORT. AS A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE FEEL OUR RANKS WITH DIVERSITY IN THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE VERY PROUD OF. BUT TO HAVE SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FULFILLED A STATUS BUT YET S. AS A MILITARY VETERAN I'VE HAD THE HONOR TO SERVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH SOMEONE WHO VERY FAMOUSLY AND PROUDLY DISPLAYED A GREEN CARD. BUT HE WAS ON A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND HE KNEW THAT BEFORE HE WOULD SHIP HOME HE WOULD FULFILL THAT AND BECOME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WELL I SEE THE SAME THING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BUT TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY I REMEMBER BEING ON DUTY AND WE WOULD GO SOMEWHERE AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE THAT WOULD SPEAK CHINESE LANGUAGE. OR SOMEONE WHO KNEW ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL ABOUT OTHER CULTURES AND SO ON SO IMAGINE HOW THIS IS GOING TO OPEN UP THE DOORS YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SERVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHO WANT TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE ON A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE AND BECAUSE THE VETTING PROCESS IS STILL THERE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GREEN CARD THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GONNA GET IN THE- THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. TO START THE PROCESS WHICH IS BACKGROUND BACKGROUND AND MORE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS SO IMPORTANT AND THEN IF YOU'RE BLESSED TO HAVE YOUR OTHER LANGUAGE AS YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE IMAGINE THE CONTRIBUTION YOU'RE MAKING TO YOUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING FOR IS LOOKING AND HAVING PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY OPEN UP SO ALONG WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I THINK WE'LL OPEN UP THE DOOR TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND CERTAINLY A PATHWAY FOR CITIZENSHIP PERSONAL. AND I REJECT AYE VOTE. THE RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I ALSO STAND HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB NINETY SIXTY AND WHEN APPROPRIATE I ALSO WANT T BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I WANT TO JUST SUCK CLARIFY HERE THAT WE ARE NOT CONDEMNING THE POLICE BY TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WORK FORCE AS A FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR US TO RECRUIT AND HOW LONG THESE POSITIONS WERE LEFT VACANT BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT WOULD APPLY. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGALLY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT DOESN'T DIMINISH THE ABILITY FOR OUR POLICE FORCES TO IMPLEMENT THE HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH RIGOROUS TESTING AND BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL. YOU KNOW- PICK THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS JUST LIKE THEY DO NOW REGARDLESS OF BEING. A CITIZEN OR NOT BUT AGAIN I WANT TO REITERATE THEY ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE WILL SEND THEM TO WAR AND WE WILL YOU KNOW PUT HIM IN OTHER PROFESSIONS WHY NOT ALLOW THEM TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES I WILL. ALSO AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT WE NEED DIVERSITY IN OUR WORKFORCE AND MANY TIMES I FIND MYSELF TRANSLATING. FOR MANY PEOPLE EIGHT IN SOME POLICE OFFICERS AT ONE POINT AND. A STATE THAT VALUES- INCLUSION DIVERSITY IN OUR WORKFORCE IS AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO MOVE FORWARD AND- I AM A- PROUD TO OUT AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I WANTED TO- LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT- SINCE I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN TWENTY ELEVEN- I HAVE ATTENDED ALMOST EVERY POLICE ACADEMY GRADUATION FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT WE WORK VERY HARD TO GET FUNDING FOR THOSE ACADEMY CLASSES ARE- AND TO ME IT WAS ALWAYS- REALLY IN UP LIFTING MOMENT TO GO AND SEE THESE YOUNG NEW CADETS- OVERWHELMINGLY DIVERSE MORE MORE WOMEN MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR COMING INTO OUR POLICING. PROFESSION WHICH HAS IS IN NEED OF REFORM AND EVOLUTION. AND OVER TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY WOULD TYPICALLY START OUT WITH ABOUT FIFTY CADETS AND BY THE TIME GRADUATION ROLLED AROUND THERE WOULD BE ABOUT FORTY SO WE'LL SEE FORTY AT THE GRADUATION. I RECENTLY WENT TO ONE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. THERE WERE TWELVE GRADUATES. AND I AND I KNEW THE ANSWER BUT I WANT TO OUR CHIEF AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHILE WIDER TWELVE. BECAUSE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE APPLYING THE POLICE ACADEMY. FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS SOCIETALLY FEWER PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO GO IN THE POLICING. AND THAT IS A THAT IS A PROBLEM AND IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR A LOT OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT IS CERTAINLY IS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SAYING WE WANT MORE. LEASE OFFICERS WALKING THE BEAT GETTING TO KNOW NEIGHBORS GETTING TO KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS GETTING TO KNOW THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT TRUST. BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITY. AND THERE ARE NO POLICE OFFICERS TO DO THAT. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHO ARE WORKING WITH OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE PAYING TAXES IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE RAISING THEIR CHILDREN. IN OUR COMMUNITY SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WHEN I SAW THIS BILL BY HIS REACTION IS WHY DIDN'T WE DO THIS A LONG TIME AGO I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY WE HEARD THIS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AND AND THERE WERE SOME ARGUMENTS BEING MADE WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN WRITING JUST INSINUATING THAT IF SOMEONE IS NOT A CITIZEN. THEN THEY MAY BE A TERRORIST OR WE MIGHT BE TRAINING THEM SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND USE THAT IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY. AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE SLANDERS THAT WE HEAR AGAINST IMMIGRANTS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THAT'S JUST REMIND EVERYONE WHEN MY FAMILY CAME HERE WE WERE IMMIGRANTS SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS- CHAMBER CAME HERE IS M. EVERYONE CAME HERE AS IMMIGRANTS AT ONE POINT SOME OF US MORE RECENTLY THAN OTHERS. AND WE CAME HERE TO BE PART OF THIS COUNTRY AND TO CONTRIBUTE- AND SO WE NEED TO. CUT IT OUT WITH THE SLANDERS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS THIS IS A GOOD AND LONG OVERDUE BILL- BILL AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. CENTERMAN AMEN PRESIDENT- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND- THE AMENDMENTS THE BILL THAT- AND I SEE NO REASON WHY DACA RECIPIENTS PERMANENT RESIDENTS ARE THOSE WITH THE GREEN CARD SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SERVICE PEACE OFFICERS- I TAUGHT MANY DREAMERS WHEN I WAS A LAW PROFESSOR AT UC IRVINE AND THEY'RE IN A TOUGH POSITION THEY CAME OVER HERE TO YOUNG AGE- THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY AMERICANS THEY THEY SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THIS COUNTRY- YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY CAME OVER TO YOUNG AGE SO AS AS OPPOSED TO BEING BORN HERE I THINK THIS REGIONAL SET OF AMENDMENTS- AND I WILL BE VOTING AYE AND I. URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE SAN. SENATOR ALAN QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR DO YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES NOTHING THIS BILL NOTHING IN THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THE RIGOROUS BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THAT WE STILL WOULD APPLY TO ANY APPLICANT LOOKING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OF IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT NOTHING IN THIS BILL TAKES AWAY ANY OTHER CRITERIA THAT ANY OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD USE TO SCREEN. TO MAKE THEIR HIRING DECISIONS OR ANYTHING NO SO OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UP TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHETHER THE PARTICULAR APPLICANT MEETS THERE- SPECIFICATIONS AND WHETHER THEY AND- ALL OF THE RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS OKAY I MEAN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS SUCH AN EMINENTLY REASONABLE BILL I MEAN IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR SCREENING SYSTEM AND THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT OUR SCREENING SYSTEM- BUT- BUT WITH THAT- WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING- I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS BILL. SENATOR CASKEY I WAS IMPLYING TO SPEAK ON THIS MADAM PRESIDENT BUT I WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT SEVERAL YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED NON CITIZENS TO SERVE ON OUR JURIES THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IT AND THE RESEARCH THAT WE DID AT THE TIME INDICATED THAT 9% OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NON CITIZENS THIRD HERE LEGALLY THEY HAVE DOCUMENTATION THAT THEY HOLE AND THEY ARE OUR CO WORKERS OUR PARENTS OUR CHILDREN THERE ARE NEIGHBORS AND THE IDEA AT THAT TIME WAS THAT. OUR JURY SHOULD REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THAT WE LIVE IN THE PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT THE- THEIR OPINIONS ARE IMPORTANT WHEN WE MAKE THE DECISION. MAKING ABOUT WHETHER SOMEBODY'S GUILTY NOT GUILTY OR GET THE AWARD OR WHATEVER IT WAS INJURE INJURIES. THIS IS THE SAME IDEA THAT THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS THEY MAKE UP 9% OF OUR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE POLICING ACTIVITY AND THE POLICING COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE. TO HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME IMPROVEMENT I HEARD IS CHEN AYE VOTE. SENATOR COME UNDER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TOO WASN'T PLANNING ON- SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I DID VOTE FOR IT IN- PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU KNOW THE HEART OF IT. IT REALLY IS ABOUT- YOU HAVE TO BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN TO SERVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND I THINK IT'S THAT IT'S HYPOCRISY FOR SO MANY OF US TO STAND UP. ON THE FLOOR AND CELEBRATE RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE AUTHORED CELEBRATING DIVERSITY AND THEN VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT IT WAS FULL BLOODED AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO STORMED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY SIXTH AND TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB NINE SIXTY. CENTER MELENDEZ. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AM I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR FOR ME. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES. HE WILL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE WHO COME FROM COUNTRIES WHO ARE HOSTILE TO THE UNITED STATES LIKE. IRAN AFGHANISTAN CUBA VENEZUELA TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION CAN WE ACCESS THAT- PERMISSION TO RESPOND- I CANNOT GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THAT HOWEVER. THIS DOES NOT AS I DID TO CLARIFY AND IS ACCURATE THIS DOES NOT PREVENT OR INTERFERE. WITH AN AGENCY'S BACKGROUND CHECK AND THAT'S IT THEY WERE FELT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO ONE ADEQUATELY. THEY WOULD HAVE FULL ABILITY TO NOT HIRE. AND SO THIS DOES NOT IMPOSE THAT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY MUST HIRE A PERSON IN THE CATEGORY THAT WE WOULD NOW ALLOW. BUT RATHER JUST IS ALLOWS IT IF THAT IS A PERSON WHO MEETS THEIR STANDARDS AND THEIR CRITERIA AND THEIR BACKGROUND CHECK. THANK YOU SO- I DO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AND THE ANSWER IS NO WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES ARE INTERESTED IN SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH US SO. A. COUNTY COULD CHOOSE TO NOT HIRE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY CAN COMPLETE A THOROUGH BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION OR THEY COULD CHOOSE TO HIRE THAT PERSON THAT IS A CHANCE THAT WE MIGHT TAKE OUR WORD ORIGIN OF THAT. SENATOR TO LETTER. MATTER PRESIDENT MAY I ASSIST OF THE AUTHOR WITH THAT QUESTION. YOU MAY THANK YOU THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS JUST ONE AGENCY THAT INVESTIGATES THE BACKGROUND WHEN OFFICER IS APPLYING ONE THE FBI IS THE SECOND HOMELAND SECURITY IS THE THIRD EVERY SINGLE AGENCY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO HAVE INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION ON ANYONE BACKGROUND TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY JUST THAT PORTION TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH OR NOT OR THAT BUT REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY OF- PRESENTED THEMSELVES WHATEVER THAT JUST ONE FACET. BUT THEY'VE GOT TO PASS ALL OF THAT THAT BACKGROUND IS INTENSE AND IT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR FOR A POLICE OFFICER FROM THE DAY HE APPLIES THE DAY HE'S HAD IT IS IT IS A BADGE SIX ABOUT A YEAR. AND SO UP. FEAR NOT WE ALL OF US SHOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL THAT MANY WOMEN WANT TO STEP FORWARD IS TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND IF THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO SERVICE NOW WHO'VE BEEN VETTED BY THE POLICE CHIEFS AND EVER GONNA WELLS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WE CAN SEE IN THE FUTURE AND AGAIN. AYE RIDGE AYE VOTE. SENATOR UMBERG A QUESTION A AUTHOR WE ACCEPT A QUESTION YES HE WILL PUMP. SO IT IF A PERSON WHO IS IN THE MILITARY HAS A GREEN CARD FOR TWENTY YEARS AND AS A MILITARY POLICEMAN BEEN DEPLOYED OVERSEAS INVESTIGATING THE MOST SERIOUS FELONIES. THEY HAVE A GREEN CARD THEY'VE BEEN IN THE MILITARY FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THEN TEY LEAVE AND THEY WANT TO JOIN THE POLICE FORCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN THEY DO SO TODAY. NO THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNDER BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR STATUTES WRITTEN THERE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WELL THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME I URGE THAT WE FIX THIS. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER BURGESS. JUST QUESTION THE AUTHOR CLARIFICATION QUESTION YES HE WILL ACCEPT IT IN YOUR RESEARCH- DID YOU EVER COME ACROSS ANY- FEDERAL FUNDING THAT REQUIRED A LOCAL ENTITY LIKE A SHARE OF FOR A POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT THEY MUST ABIDE BY FEDERAL RULES TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS AND SO FORTH. I AM SURE THERE ARE SOME SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT MAY REQUIRE FEDERAL RULES BUT THOSE WOULD VERY AND WHAT FEDERAL RULES THEY APPLY BUT AS FOR IT BUT IF WE GIVE THE EXAMPLE. AND AS WE KNOW JUST LIKE IN OUR LIKE OUR STATE RULES THE VERY THEY'RE NOT ALL CONSISTENT THE FEDERAL RULES ARE NOT OFF CONSISTENT EITHER. BUT THE POINT THAT OUR SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY JUST MADE WHICH POINTS OUT THAT. RIGHT NOW YOU CAN BE A NON CITIZEN RESIDENTS WITH FULL. LEGAL WORK AUTHORIZATION AND SERVE IN OUR MILITARY AND BE A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THE SAME AND B. POLICE OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA. OKAYAND I'M ON MY OWN TIME I KNOW WE USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE I WOULD CAUTION US BECAUSE I THINK. THEY'RE IN THE MILITARY HAS A HISTORY. OF ALLOWING FOR A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP CITIZENSHIP BY VIRTUE OF AGREEING TO SERVICE. THAT GOES BACK YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF YEARS IF YOU WILL OR HUNDRED OVER HUNDRED YEARS IF YOU WILL- WHEN WE HAD AN ISSUE IN FRESNO COUNTY- ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SHERIFF. WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. WE LEARNED THAT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. DROPPED THE HAMMER AND SAID WE WILL STOP FEDERAL FUNDING AND MAKE YOU INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING AND GRANTS IF YOU DON'T ABIDE BY FEDERAL LAW. SO MY QUESTION. AND I ALLOW IT YOU KNOW WHAT I ENCOURAGE- YOU TO. LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER ISTHAT BY VIRTUE OF DOING THIS COULD WE BE PUTTING OURSELVES ON TWO SEPARATE FINANCIAL PASS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEREBY. THEY ONLY RECEIVE CALIFORNIA FUNDING IN FORFEIT FEDERAL. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING NINE CENTER SKINNER YOU MAKE INCLUDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CON THE COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES AND THE AND I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE A MEMBERS WITH SUCH EXPERTISE AND OUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. OUR POLICE CHIEFS WHO ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IF THEY FELT THAT THIS WOULD EXCLUDE THEM FROM ANY SOURCE OF FEDERAL FUNDING I DOUBT THEY WOULD BE IN SUPPORT BUT CERTAINLY WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT- BUT THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT WE ARE IN GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR RANK AND FILE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO AS SOME OF OUR MEMBERS AT THE CENTRE FROM LONG BEACH POINTED OUT. THERE ARE MANY OF THOSE MEMBERS WHO REALLY WANT THIS TO PASS AND- BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST SOME DETAILS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE MORE COMFORT MORE WORKING TOGETHER AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THERE THAT'S MY OPTIMISM AND THAT- IT HI MY HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE SEE THIS BILL AGAIN AFTER THE ASSEMBLY AT SOMETHING THAT EVEN MORE OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES SUPPORT- SO- WE'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT I THINK IT'S IN VERY GOOD SHAPE NOW. BECAUSE IT'S STILL IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT ANY OF IT OTHER RICK MENSTRUAL RIGOROUS APPROACH SEES THAT OUR LAWN AGENCIES WOULD GO THROUGH TO HIRE SOMEONE AND WITHOUT A VOTE. SECHRIST PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

R. NINETY FIVE- REGARDING- HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. YOM SHOAH- HOLOCAUST WITH THE GENOCIDE OF SIX MILLION JEWS PERPETRATED BY THE **** DURING WORLD WAR TWO. OUR SIX MILLION JEWS AND OTHERS- WE'RE PLACING GAS CHAMBERS WHERE THEY WERE TOLD THEY WERE TAKING A SHOWER STRIP DOWN NAKED AFTER THEY HAD BEEN- TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR COMMUNITY PUT ON THE- BASICALLY CATTLE CARS. TAKEN TO THESE CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND DEATH CAMPS. TOLD THEY WERE TAKING A SHOWER- AND THEN GAS CAME OUT AND THEY DIED ON THEIR BODIES WERE INCINERATED THAT WAS THAT WAS SET UP- FOR- SIX MILLION JEWS- AND MILLIONS. OF OTHERS WHILE THE WORLD'S- FOR TOO LONG DID NOTHING IN THE BUILD UP- TO THE EXTERMINATION OF THE SIX MILLION JEWS WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THE DIRECTION. OF WHERE GERMANY WAS HEADING AND THE WORLD REALLY DID NOTHING AND THIS COUNTRY THEN LEDGERS KOMMEN WHO WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT GENOCIDE DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN. IT BUILDS UP OVER TIME SWEITZER IMPORT FOR ALL OF US TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. ON THIS DAY OF REMEMBRANCE BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT EVERY YEAR. AS WE LOSE MORE MORE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS- THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT AND DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS- EVEN IN THE FACE OF SOME OF THE LIVES AND HOLOCAUST DENIALISM THAT WE SEE IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. WE'RE LOSING THOSE SURVIVORS YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE HOLOCAUST IS TRAGEDY SALAMAN SAID IT'S ALMOST. IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUR MINDS AROUND WHICH IS WHY HOLOCAUST DENIALISM. HI IS SOMETIMES SO EFFECTIVE THE IDEA THAT A GOVERNMENT. WOULD SAY WE'RE GOING TO EXTERMINATE REALLY ALLOWED IN MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING SIX MILLION JEWS SIX MILLION PEOPLE FROM ONE ETHNIC GROUP WE'RE JUST GOING TO METHODICALLY PLAN. AND JUST KILL THEM EACH OF THEM. THAT THAT IS HARD TO GET THEIR MINDS AROUND AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER ALWAYS- THE PEOPLE MURDERED WERE PEOPLE LIKE US. THESE ARE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND CHILDREN YES THEY PUT CHILDREN IN THESE GAS CHAMBERS AND BURNED THEIR BODIES TO. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE LOWEST INCOME ALL THE WAY TO THE WEALTHIEST AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN THESE WERE PEOPLE JUST LIKE US. AND THIS IS IN A EMANATING FROM A COUNTRY THAT BEFORE. HELLO TOOK OVER. WAS CONSIDERED A PROGRESSIVE FORWARD LOOKING COUNTRY. WHERE JEWS WERE LGBTQ PEOPLE AT CETERA WERE ACCEPTED. AND THEN IT TURNS AND SIX MILLION JEWS AND FIVE MILLION OTHERS WERE METHODICALLY EXTERMINATED. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE HATRED AND THE VIOLENCE THAT LED TO THE HOLOCAUST AS I MENTIONED DIDN'T JUST RANDOMLY HAPPEN IT BUILT UP HAPPENING NOW IN OUR OWN COUNTRY CONTINUED VIOLENCE AND DEMONISATION OF JEWS WHEN WE LOOK AT CHARLOTTESVILLE BUT THE PEOPLE WITH THE TIKI TORCHES CHANTING JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US THE REPLACEMENT THEORY THAT JEWS ARE TRYING TO REPLACE EVERYONE ELSE. OR THE ATTACK. ON THE CAPITAL IN JANUARY SEXY ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE US GOVERNMENT WITH SLOGANS LIKE CAMP HOUSE FENCE. THAT WAS A JANUARY SEX IN OUR COUNTRY. A US CITIZEN. PEOPLE WHO CELEBRATED THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF THE HOLOCAUST AND WANTED TO BE REPEATED. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TODAY WHO APPEAR WITH **** BRAZENLY WITH NO SHAME. LITERALLY UP ON A STAGE WITH HITLER. WE HAVE. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES- WHIPPED. CONGRESSMAN FROM LOUISIANA WHO SHARED A STAGE WITH DAVID DUKE CLANSMEN A **** I WAS STEVE SCALISE. I'M NAMING NAMES BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NAME HIS NAME'S. REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT. WHO GAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HOLOCAUST DENYING PREACHER- PAUL GOSAR WHOSE FAMILY HAS DENOUNCED HIM FOR HIS ANTI SEMITIC RHETORIC. YOU'LL IN BIGOTRY AND HATE AND VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN. WITH A HISTORY OF ANTI SEMITIC COMMENTS SO. SIGNIFICANT AND LUMINOUS THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE SHE'S ONLY BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR A FEW YEARS TO SAY AND DO THAT MANY ANTI SEMITIC THINGS. WE SAY EVERY YEAR NEVER AGAIN. WITH RESPECT TO THE HOLOCAUST. BUT EVERY YEAR WE CONTINUE TO SEE GENOCIDE ON THIS PLANET. EFFORTS TO JUST WIPE OUT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ENTIRE ETHNICITIES. IT KEEPS HAPPENING HOLOCAUST THE BUILD UP. AND IT'S HAPPENED SINCE. WE NEED TO HONOR OUR HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. AND THERE AGAIN FEWER AND FEWER EVERY YEAR WE NEED TO REMEMBER. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN PEOPLE WALK IN THE SYNAGOGUES. AND COMMIT MASS MURDER WALLPAPER PRYING THAT'S SUCH AS RANDOM. SUCH AS SOMEONE RANDOMLY WANTS TO COMMIT GUN VIOLENCE. WE KNOW THAT HATE CRIMES AGAINST JEWS ARE OPTING CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO NOT TO SAY NEVER AGAIN BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ACTIONS MATCH THOSE WORDS NEVER AGAIN I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I CERTAINLY RISE IN SUPPORT. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AS A PART OF AN AGRICULTURAL FELLOWSHIP WE TRAVELED TO EGYPT INDIA PAKISTAN ISRAEL AND ITALY IN OUR TIME AND IT'LL AND ISRAEL WAS SO MOVING THE HOLY LAND. THE HOMELESS LAND ON EARTH. IS VIRTUALLY A MILITARY STATE. I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THE FAMILY IN TEL AVIV. AFTER DINNER WE WERE VISITING AND I ASKED THE WIFE HOW IS IT TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. WHERE YOU'RE UNDER CONSTANT THREAT OF VIRTUAL MILITARY STATE. HOW IS. SHE SAID SIMPLY AND SOME THINGS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT'S THE STRINGS STRONG RESOLVE OF THOSE ISRAELI CITIZENS TO PRESERVE THEIR HOMELAND. THIS ISSUE I SUBMIT IS NOT A ONE OF THE PAST. ALONE THE PASSES OF GREAT MAGNITUDE AND MANY ETHNICITIES OF SUFFERED. BUT IT'S ALSO CURRENT. IN PERSPECTIVE. AS WE SIT HERE. MANY NATIONS THROUGHOUT IN THE WORLD. SUCH BEHAVIOR THIS STILL RAMPANT. SUCH KILLING. THIS STILL NORM NOT AN EXCEPTION. IN MANY OF OUR LEADERS. REMAIN SILENT. ABOUT IT WHY WELL- FISCAL IMPLICATIONS IN TRADE IMPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S REALLY NOT OKAY THE DISCOUNT RATE DOESN'T STAND UP TO SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ALLOW THIS KIND OF GENOCIDE. TO CONTINUE. SO AS WE VOTE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN DON'T THINK YEARS SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE PAST. BUT WE ARE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THE CHALLENGES. CURRENTLY AND OF THE FUTURE. SENATOR DRESS OF. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I OUT RISE AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IT'S MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR NINETY FIVE. WE MUST LEARN WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE FULL HISTORY OF EVENTS LIKE THE HOLOCAUST THE CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. NO WORDS THAT WOULD EXPRESS A DAY. CAN ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE GRAVITY OF THE ATROCITIES THAT OCCURRED. THINK ABOUT IT JUST SEVENTY YEARS AGO SIX MILLION JEWS AND AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION OTHER PEOPLE WHOM THE INFERIOR. THEY TWO WERE MURDERED AS PART OF A STATE SANCTION GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED EFFORT. OF ANNIHILATION. SO WHILE WE REMEMBER THE ATROCITIES LET US ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE ACTS OF HEROISM OF LOVE OF RISK AND EMPATHY THAT ALSO OCCURRED DURING THOSE VERY VERY DARK TIMES COUNTLESS STORIES OF EVERYDAY HEROES WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT AND SAVE PEOPLE NOT JUST SPEAKING OUT BUT TOOK RISKS OF THEIR LIVES. WHO WERE IN LINE TO BE MURDERED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE RELIGION OR OTHER DIFFERENCES WE STILL HEAR THOSE WORDS TODAY. LAST YEAR I REFERENCE THE STORY OF SIR NICHOLAS WINTON. WHO SAVE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE CHILDREN IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR TWO HE HELP SAVE THESE CHILDREN FROM THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST THE REFUGEE PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO HELP KIDS YOUNGER THAN SEVENTEEN RELOCATE IF THEY HAD A HOST FAMILY. MANY OF THESE STORIES AND PERSONAL ACCOUNTS ARE BEING PRESERVED TODAY IN OUR OWN STATE USC'S SHOAH FOUNDATION FOUNDED BY FILM DIRECTOR STEVEN SPIELBERG. TEACHES THE TESTIMONY IT HOUSES SOME FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AUDIO AND VISUAL TESTIMONIES THE BULK OF WHICH ARE FROM FIRST HAND WITNESSES TO THE HOLOCAUST. THESE ACCOUNTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US AND SCHOLARS SO FUTURE GENERATIONS KNOW THAT EVEN IN THE MONT MIDST OF UNSPEAKABLE TERROR AND EVIL THERE IS LIGHT. AND LET US LASTLY REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IT STARTED WITH EXPRESSIONS OF HATE INCIDENTS OF HATE OF DE HUMANIZING OF VIOLENCE AND THAT-LED TO THE HOLOCAUST BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE STOOD UP TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT. ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION TO THE JEWISH CAUCUS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WORK AND JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING S. C. R. NINETY FIVE. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AT THE SENATE TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS TO SUPPORT. S. C. R. NINETY FIVE WHICH URGES ALL CALIFORNIANS HIS OBSERVE THIS DAY AS HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCAUST WOMEN ENTERED BRUTAL PERSECUTION THAT WAS SENTENCED UNIQUE TO THEIR GENDER. THREE **** DEPORTATION OPERATIONS PREGNANT WOMEN AND MOTHERS OF SMALL CHILDREN WERE CONSISTENTLY LABELED INCAPABLE OF WORK. THEY WERE SENT TO KILLING CENTERS WORK CAMP OFFICIALS OFTEN INCLUDED THEM IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PEOPLE SENT TO THE GAS CHAMBERS IN CAPS AND GOGGLES WOMEN WERE SUBJECTED TO FORCED LABOR THAT OFTEN LEAD TO THEIR DEATH. DEPRIVATION FROM FOOD WATER AND MEDICAL CARE SEX TRAFFICKING IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED BROTHELS FOR GERMAN SOLDIERS STERILIZATION AND OTHER UNETHICAL HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION BEATINGS RAPES SEXUAL SORRY SALTS AND FORCED ABORTIONS BUT WOMEN WERE MORE THAN JUST VICTIMS DURING THE HOLOCAUST MANY WOMEN WORK FOR THE SURVIVAL AND LIBERATION OF OTHERS. WOMEN WERE ACTIVE IN AID AND RESCUE OPERATIONS THEY LED RESISTANCE GROUPS IN THE KETTLES AND REST THEIR LIVES TO HELP OTHERS. I HAD PERSONAL PRIVILEGES HAVE BEEN INTO EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN ONE WAS A HUNDRED AND FIVE YEARS OLD. ONE OF THE LAST SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND SHE SHARED SOME OF HER HORRIFIC STORIES OF TORTURE. I KNEW ANOTHER WONDERFUL WOMAN HER NAME WAS FINE YOUNG WAS FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN SHE ESCAPED ON HER OWN. SHE'S FOUND A LITTLE HOLE UNDERNEATH THE BOB WEIR IN CALL CENTER AND- SHE WAS ELDERLY AT THE TIME AND SHOWED ME THE SCARS ON HER BACK IT WASN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR HER TO CALL AND- AND THE SCARS OF THE SCRATCHES ON HER BACK. WERE HORRIFIC TO WATCH. IN IN HER HONOR I THINK WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THESE EXPERIENCES WERE REAL. AND SOME OF THEM FIRST A LONG LASTING AND DEVASTATING JUST TO THINK ABOUT HISTORIANS AND DESCENDANTS WHO NOW ALSO WANT TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION. WE ALL TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO SHARE THE STORIES BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT AS ALREADY STATED IT WAS SEVENTY YEARS AGO. WE'RE STILL IN A AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE STILL USING VERY MUCH HATRED BIGOTRY. AND ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF ONE ANOTHER AND I APPRECIATE THE GREAT CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO MENTIONS SOME OF OUR LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY. WHO DON'T HOLD BACK AND CONTINUE TO PUSH SUCH HATRED. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. C. R. NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR NINETY FIVE I THINK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRING YOUR FORD AND HIS SHARE OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. A LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I'M ALSO HONORED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT RESOLUTION- RECOGNIZING HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. NO WE SAY NEVER AGAIN WE SAY NEVER FORGET WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN. RIGHT- WE TALK ABOUT SIX MILLION JEWS WHO WERE MURDERED MASSACRED TORTURED. KILLED ELEVEN MILLION TOTAL- HOLOCAUST THOSE ARE. WHAT IS NUMBERS REALLY MEAN. RIGHT SOMETIMES THE NUMBERS WHEN THEY GET BIG PEOPLE DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT. IN NOW SEVEN YEARS LATER- WE STILL HAVE SURVIVORS BUT ARE WE FORGETTING AND WE SEE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND FORTUNATELY IN OUR COUNTRY- THE NINE HOLOCAUST MINIMIZING THE HOLOCAUST- SOMETIMES PARTNERING WITH PEOPLE WHO ATE HERE TO THE SAME IDEOLOGY- SOMETIMES SEEMINGLY WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. SO WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT US. AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT- BOTH WHAT HAPPENED THEN. AND NOT JUST WHAT HAPPENED IN **** GERMANY BUT HOW DID THE US RESPOND. RIGHT SO NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE SHIP OF JEWS. OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA. RETURN WAY FOR LIKE THE BORDER BY IMMIGRATION. THAT'S WHAT OUR COUNTRY DID- SO FOR THE API ME OF COURSE WE EXPERIENCE NOT YOU KNOW NOT TRYING DRAW ANY EQUIVALENCE NOW THE JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE INCARCERATED. RIGHT BY OUR OWN GOVERNMENT AS WELL. AND BECAUSE OF BUT BECAUSE I SHARED EXPERIENCE SITUATION EIGHTY I COMMITTEES HAVE LONG PARTNERED TOGETHER IN TRYING TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE- THIS LONG HISTORY COMBINED IF OF A FIFTEEN A PHOBIA ANTONSEN RACISM WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE. THE PARTNER TOGETHER TO RAISE AWARENESS- TO COMBAT. POLICIES THE INVOKE POLICIES INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY ANTI MUSLIM POLICIES AND FIGHTING AGAINST HATE CRIMES ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE ARE LOSING A GENERATION THAT WAS ONCE ABLE TO TELL THEIR OWN STORIES TO REMIND US OF THE NEED TO CONSTRUCT THIS TREE TO BECOME RESILIENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE. SO IT'S OUR DUTY TO CONTINUE THAT SO NOW THE SURVIVORS- AND FORTY AS TIME GOES ON MORE MORAL PASSED AWAY SO WITH NOW ARE WE NEED TO PICK UP THAT TORCH. THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT CONTINUING TO CARRY THAT TORCH. TO GIVE US THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TELLING THOSE STORIES THE STORIES THAT THE SURVIVORS THEMSELVES MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE TO TELL. WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO TELL THEM WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TEACH FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL SAY CIVILIZATIONS ACTUALLY BUILT A NEW WITH EVERY GENERATION. RIGHT SO WE NEED TO BE SURE FUTURE GENERATIONS REMEMBER. UNDERSTAND WHAT SIX MILLION MEETS. HOW BIG OF A NUMBER THAT IS WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT. THAT WHY WHAT CAN BE THE RESULT OF ANTI SEMITISM. WHAT COULD BE THE RESULT OF EXTERMINATION WHAT CAN BE THE RESULT OF HATE. INSTRUMENTOS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN. WE SEE- ST WE SAW BEFORE WE'RE STILL SEEING IT BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST SO WITH THAT ASPECT WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE SUPPORT FOR THE C. R. FIVE AND AFTER YOU VOTE FOR IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO HELP CARRY THAT TORCH FORD AND THAT MEMORY FOR THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THEY SAY- THE WORD REMEMBER IN HEBREW IS A **** WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO REMEMBER. WE CAN GO WAY BACK IN TIME- AND THINK ABOUT DECADES AGO AND- WHAT IT MUST'VE BEEN LIKE TO BE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD KID WATCHING YOUR MOM. GOING TO A DIFFERENT LINE THAN YOU DID IN BEING TOLD TO TAKE A SHOWER AND SUDDENLY YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY'S GONE. THOSE MEMORIES GET WORN WITH TIME JUST LIKE MEMORIES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ENSLAVED OR SUBJECT TO GENOCIDE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU TELL THOSE STORIES BUT- THEY ALMOST BECOME EXOTIC. LIKE SOME DISTANT HERITAGE THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW IN THE DANGER I THINK TODAY IN REMEMBERING IS THAT WE PUT IT ALL IN BLACK AND WHITE. AND WE THINK THIS IS SOME DISTANT PART OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE NEED TO REACH BACK TO BUT- THE SURVIVOR STILL WALK AMONG US. END TO EXOTIC SIZE- THEIR LIVES AND MAKE THOSE PERIODS OF TIME THOSE MONTHS OFTEN NOT EVEN YEARS SPENT DURING THE HOLOCAUST- IS TO RISK MAKING ALL THAT SO EXCEPTIONAL. AND TO RISK THEIR EXPERIENCE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD- BEING SOME KIND OF UNIQUE EXISTENCE. WATCHING MY OWN FAMILY. AND HOW JOSHUA. MY FATHER IN LAW WHO LIVES WITH US GO ABOUT HIS DAY NOBODY'S LIFE IN LA. THE PLUMBER. SO MANY WILL MOVE LA IN THE SEVENTIES LIKE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY. TRY TO MAKE MAKE ENDS MEET PUT HIS KIDS THROUGH SCHOOL. DO THE BASIC THINGS FOR FOOD ON THE TABLE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR LIFE BUT WITH ALL THAT HISTORY SITTING IN THE BACKGROUND EVERY DAY EVERY TIME YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES THOSE MEMORIES RUSH BACK. TO LIVE WITH THAT EXPERIENCE I WALK AROUND WITH IT. AND TO INSIST ON BEING HAPPY. AND TO INSIST ON BUOYANCY AND SYSTEM RESILIENCE IT'S ARRESTING IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT GOING ABOUT YOUR DAY SURVIVED THE KILLING FIELDS OF CAMBODIA WHO WALK AROUND. OUR OUR STREETS IN LA IN CALIFORNIA WATCHING THEIR FAMILIES GO PEOPLE IMMIGRATED FROM EL SALVADOR IN THE EIGHTIES WATCHING THEIR FAMILY'S GONE. THERE'S NOTHING. UNFORTUNATELY UNIQUE ABOUT THIS HISTORY OF TRAUMA THIS GENOCIDE WAS ON A DIFFERENT SCALE THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BUT LET US NOT MAKE THE HOLOCAUST SOMETHING IT'S SO FAR OUT OF REACH THAT IT COULD NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN. AND THAT WE CAN'T SURVIVE FROM. AND LIVE THROUGH WITH SOME DIGNITY. SO WHEN YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELVES HOW DO I REMEMBER AND HOW DO I CARRY THAT TORCH. HOW DO WE SURVIVE BEYOND SURVIVAL. HOW DO WE EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THE ACTUAL WITNESSES ARE NOT THERE TO TESTIFY ANYMORE IT'S ON US TO DO THAT. I WOULD SAY TO THINK ABOUT. THESE NEXT FEW YEARS IS VERY PRECIOUS MOMENTS. THERE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND SURVIVORS STILL LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 50% OF THOSE SURVIVORS STILL WITH US IN LA SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO IN PARTICULAR. 50% ARE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. SO IN YOUR COMMUNITY THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO WENT THROUGH ALL THAT. WORKED DID SOME QUIET JOB THAT NO ONE EVER NOTICED AND THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST THEY SERVE FOOD AT A DINER THEY WORKED ON YOUR PLUMBING THEY HELP TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS THEY DID THEIR WORK. JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES IN THE STATE THEIR LIFE. AND DIGNITY IS OUT OF REACH. LITERALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD ON THE TABLE. BEING FORCED INTO SUB STANDARD LIVING CONDITIONS IN CONGREGATE CARE WITHOUT ACCESS. TO ANYONE ON THE CALL BUTTON TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. THE CITY. IN THEIR OWN SITTING THERE FOR DAYS. NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT IT OUR CARE SYSTEM. NOT ABLE TO TAKE A SHOWER OR- WHEN KOBE HITS AGAIN BE SENT TO THE YELLOWSTONE OF THE GREENS ON BECAUSE YOU'RE LITERALLY TRIGGERING ALL THAT FROM AGAIN YOU'RE SAYING NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE A SHOWER NOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE GREENS ARE NICE TO GO TO. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE TRAUMA AND THEY'RE DYING RIGHT NOW. AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT. WE CAN PROVIDE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE. I THINK INVESTING. IN THAT DIGNITY RIGHT NOW. IS THE MOST POWERFUL WAY WE CAN REMEMBER BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT IF WE INVEST IN THAT DIGNITY NOT JUST FOR SURVIVORS OF THIS HOLOCAUST BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE TO GO THROUGH A FULL LIFE AND ENDED THAT WAY. AFTER SURVIVING SO MUCH. LET'S NOT MAKE THIS REMEMBRANCE HISTORY LESSON. LET'S MAKE A COMMITMENT TO WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. S. ZERO. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS A VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS TO SUPPORT S. C. R. NINETY FIVE WHICH REMEMBERS THE ATROCITIES OF THE HOLOCAUST. WHILE BLACK PEOPLE INCLUDING AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE ALSO IMPRISONED OR SENT TO INTERNMENT OR CONCENTRATION CAMPS I CHOOSE TO SPEAK OF SOMETHING UPLIFTING ABOUT BLACK CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENDING WORLD WAR TWO. AND DELIBERATING JEWISH PEOPLE WITHIN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS. THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST TANK BATTALION THE FIRST ALL BLACK ARMORED BATTALION OF WORLD WAR TWO DUBBED THEMSELVES THE BLACK PANTHERS THERE WERE TALLIEN LOGO DEPICTING A BLACK PANTHER AND THAT NICKNAME AND IMAGERY WAS LATER ADOPTED BY THE NINETEEN SIXTIES CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP. THE UNITS THIRTY SIX OFFICERS INCLUDED BASEBALL STAR JACKIE ROBINSON ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SEE ACTION IN EUROPE. THE BLACK PANTHERS FOUGHT MAJOR BATTLES IN SIX EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND WE'RE PART OF FOUR MAJOR ALLIED CAMPAIGNS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST TANK BATTALION PARTICIPATED IN THE LIBERATION OF CONSCRIPTS ON A SUB CAMP OF THE MOOSE AUSTIN CONCENTRATION CAMP IN MAY. NINETEEN FORTY FIVE. THE BLACK PANTHERSWERE RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND ALSO BY PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS. SO WHEN YOU WHITE HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND POETS. WHO WAS LIBERATED FROM THAT CAMP. WROTE ABOUT THE BLACK PANTHERS ROLE IN HER POEM THE BLACK MESSIAH. SO YOU WAS SIXTY POUNDS WHEN SHE WAS FOUND. SHE WAS MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE. AND SHE SURVIVED HER PARENTS AND MANY FAMILY MEMBERS. SHE ALSO WAS A SURVIVOR. OF THE OF FIVE GHETTO PERMISSION TO READ. PERMISSION GRANTED SHE WRITES. A BLACK GI STOOD BY THE DOOR I NEVER SAW A BLACK BEFORE HILL SET ME FREE BEFORE I DIE I THOUGHT HE MUST BE THE MESSIAH. A BLACK MESSIAH CAME FOR ME. HE STARED WITH EYES THAT DIDN'T SEE WHICH HUNG ABSURD UPON MY TONGUE PLACE THE SHOCK THE HORROR ON HIS FACE. HE DIDN'T WEEP HE DIDN'T CRY BUT DEEP WITHIN HIS GENTLE EYES A FLOOD OF DEVASTATING PAIN HIS INNOCENCE FOR EVER SLANG FOR ME WITH YET ANOTHER DON. I FOUND MY BLACK MESSIAH GONE AND ON WE WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT A TRACE BUT THERE'S A SPECIAL BOND WE SHARE WHICH HAS GROWN STRONG BECAUSE WE DARE. TO LIVE TO HOPE TO SMILE AND YET. WE VOW NOT EVER. TO FORGET. I ASK ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS TO STAND WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. NINETY FIVE MUCH TO THE DISMAY AND RECOLLECT ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. AND- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK AMONGST THE GHOSTS OF AN ASHES BIRKENAU INTERAGENCY SIDE DACHAU WESTERN BORK. BOB AND IF YOU EVER HAVE THOSE SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES I CAN ONLY. IMPRESS UPON YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING TAKING ADVANTAGES OPPORTUNITIES. OUT BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME EXTRAORDINARY INSTITUTIONS HERE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE OUR COLLEAGUES MADE I JUST WANT TO TELL A STORY. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT HOW OUR INVESTMENT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THIS TOPIC. I THERE WAS A SOME PRETTY UGLY INCIDENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN SOME CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE TEENAGERS GOT TOGETHER AND SINGING **** SONGS- SET UP COPS IN A- SWASTIKA SHAPE AND PLAYED GAMES MADE LIGHT. OF THE IMAGERY. AND MILITARISM OF THE **** REGIME. I DO HAVE BEEN SO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO CONDEMN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE CALL THEM BIGOTS RACISTS. VILIFY THEM CANCEL THEM. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASY THING TO DO RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT THEY DONE WAS VERY UGLY. AND YET- THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO RECOGNIZE THESE WERE KIDS THESE WERE THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REALLY DIDN'T KNOW BETTER IF ANYTHING THEIR ACTIONS WERE MARKED BY THEIR IGNORANCE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY INSTITUTION- THAT WE'VE HELPED TO FIND. I DIDN'T PUSH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ASIDE THEY INVITED THEM TO THE MUSEUM THEY BROUGHT THEY PAID TO BRING THEM TO THE MUSEUM. WHERE THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST MANY OF THEM. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A VERY REAL WAY. WHERE THEY MET WITH SURVIVORS SOME OF THOSE FEW PRECIOUS SURVIVORS. THAT ARE STILL WALKING AMONG US. SAT IN A SMALL ROOM WITH THOSE SURVIVORS HEARD THEIR STORIES. AND IT CHANGED OUR LIVES FOREVER I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF READING SOME OF THE LETTERS OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WROTE TO THE MUSEUM AFTERWARDS WHERE THEY JUST POURED THEIR HEARTS OUT. IN REGRET. TALKING ABOUT HOW LITTLE THEY KNEW OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN THEY BEHAVED IN. SUCH A DISRESPECTFUL MANNER. AND THAT EXPERIENCE CHANGE OUR LIVES FOREVER AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE ACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING UP AND DOWN OUR STATE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ALL OVER THE WORLD MUSEUMS CULTURAL CENTERS EDUCATORS WHO ARE EXPOSING THE NEXT GENERATION. I TO THIS UGLY HISTORY. WE HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THOSE SURVIVORS THOSE PRECIOUS SURVIVORS THAT CAN STILL SPEAK TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE SO ELOQUENTLY AND SO DIRECTLY OF COURSE ALL THE SURVIVORS WHO ARE LEFT WERE CHILDREN THEMSELVES WHEN THE HOLOCAUST TOOK PLACE AND I THINK THERE'S A SPECIAL CONNECTION. THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY TELL THEIR STORIES OF HAVING SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST AS A CHILD AS A TEENAGER AS A YOUNG PERSON. SO WE CAN AND MUST INVEST IN THESE KINDS OF INSTITUTIONS AND THESE AND THIS SORT OF GRACE AND LOVE WHICH IS WHAT THAT MUSEUM SHOW TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IN SO DOING MADE IT SO MUCH LESS LIKELY THAT- THAT THEY WILL EVER ACT IN THE BIGOTED MANNER IN THE FUTURE. AND SO I WANT US TO AS WE REFLECT WITH GREAT SORROW. BASED ON THE LEGACY OF THE HOLOCAUST I ALSO WANT TO BE INSPIRED BY THE INCREDIBLE EDUCATING WORK THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW HERE IN OUR STATE IN SO MANY WONDERFUL INSTITUTIONS LIKE LAWCENTER MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ASK FOR A VOTE. I COMMEND PRESIDENT- I KNOW SOME OF THE MEMBERS. NOTED I'VE LIVED IN POLAND FOR THREE YEARS OF MY ADULT LIFE AND- I WAS OUT THERE IN. EIGHTY SIX THIS IS THIS IS STUDENT SO. THE FORTY YEARS AFTER THE WAR WAS- I GUESS CLOSER IN TIME. AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNIZING THIS WHOLE HOLOCAUST. YOU KNOW PRE WAR POLAND. HAD THE LARGEST POPULATION OF JEWS. ANYWHERE THERE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE AND AT THE END OF THE WAR SIX MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED THE POST WAR UP POPULATIONS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR IN ABOUT. YOU KNOW THREE MILLION CATHOLIC POLES THREE MILLION ODD- JEWISH POLES WERE KILLED. AND I THINK THE SCHOLARSHIP THAT'S GOING ON IN THOSE FORTY SOME ODD YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THAT WORK T. TWO. GET MORE GRANULAR AND UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF THAT FINAL SOLUTION ON THE JEWISH QUESTION BECAUSE THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS THE EXTERMINATION OF ALL FLOCKS. YOU KNOW RACIALLY INFERIOR WHETHER YOU'RE AFRICAN AMERICAN BROWN ANYTHING HOMOSEXUAL WERE THEY WERE PART OF THE FIVE MILLION THAT WERE ALSO KILLED. IN INTELLIGENCE THE COMMUNIST ANYBODY THAT DISAGREED. WITH FOLKS IN IF YOU'VE TRAVELED IN POLAND YOU REALIZE THE POLISH WORD FOR FIELDER FLATLINERS POLLING THE POLLING MEANS FLAT LAND YOU REALIZE THAT THIS WAS STATE GEOGRAPHIC TAKEOVER OF. BY THE **** THAT WE'RE GOOD TO GO EAST TO THESE TO THESE LANDS WERE THE JEWS AND THE SLOBS LIVE TODAY TO EXTERMINATE ALL OF THEM I MEAN IT IT THE HORROR IS NOT ONLY THE SYSTEMATIC PLANNING OF THIS EXTERMINATION BUT THEN THE THIS EXECUTION AND- IT. WHEN WE REMEMBER THE WORD THAT WE LOOK AT CURRENT EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND IT SHOULD SPARK OUR ATTENTION AND OUR AND OUR- OUTRAGE OVER HOW WE CAN BE SO INHUMANE TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE SHARE. WORLD WITH SHARP RISE IN SUPPORT IT'S VERY SAD OCCASION BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CATION TO REMEMBER. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SAID IT'S A VERY PROFOUND DAY FOR SO MANY OF US. I WANT TO DO I SHARE WITH YOU THAT. THE MEMORIES OF A YOUNG BOY- IT'S PROBABLY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD TWENTY YEARS PAST THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO AND THE STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENED WERE PROFOUND IN RELIGIOUS SCHOOL. AND THE. IN THAT TRAUMA YEAH WE ALL HANDLE IT DIFFERENTLY FOR ME IT WAS TO PUT MY HEAD ON THE PILLOW AT NIGHT. AND THINK TO MYSELF- WHAT IF I WAS IN GERMANY. DURING THAT TIME. OR WHAT IF I WAS IN POLAND WOULD I. WHAT WOULD I KNOW. WHAT WHAT I HEAR. WHAT WOULD I SEE. AND WHAT WOULD I DO WHAT WOULD I DO- IT'S PRETTY PRETTY SCARY THOUGHTS FOR A YOUNG BOY. AND IT RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT MY LIFE WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT GOING FORWARD AND- WHAT KIND OF RESOLVED THAT I HAVE IN THAT. IN GRAVE SITUATIONS. OKAY COURAGE WOULD I BE ABLE TO MUSTER. AND SO AS I HAVE LIVED MY LIFE. IT'S GUARD BY THOSE MEMORIES. I CONTINUE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED THEM IN THIS DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR TODAY AS WELL. WHAT WOULD I KNOW. WHAT WOULD DIE HERE WHAT WHAT I SEE AND WHAT WOULD I DO. AND I HOPE THAT ON DAYS LIKE COLLECTIVE MEMORIES AS JEWS. AS A CITIZENS OF THE WORLD THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AS PROFOUND QUESTIONS THE SCARS THAT MANY OF US HAVE LIVED THROUGH. CLOSER THAN TODAY WOULD RESONATE AS STRONGLY AS THEY DID BANKS THAT YOUNG BOY- PUTTING ONE'S HEAD ON THE PILLOW AT NIGHT. SAYING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.
