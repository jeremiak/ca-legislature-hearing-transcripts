AROUND OCEAN CONDITIONS THAT

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.022
MIGHT ALLOW FOLKS TO TAKE A

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:39.058
DEEP BREATH AND CALM A LITTLE.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.860
PEOPLE MAY RECALL THAT ABOUT A

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.362
MONTH AGO A WE WERE SEEING SOME

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.665
A BRICK IN OUR MEDIA SPACE

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.266
AROUND THE LIKELIHOOD OF

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.435
ANOTHER WARM WATER BLOB. I KNOW

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.103
FOR WOMAN I READ THOSE STORIES

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.039
I HAD A FREAK OUT BECAUSE THE

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.274
WARM WATER BLOOD THE LAST GO

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:55.842
AROUND WAS IMMENSELY

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.044
CHALLENGING FOR ALL OF US. WHAT

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.847
WE NOW KNOW TODAY IS LOOKING AT

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:02.682
THE LATEST IMAGES WE SEE THAT

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.784
THE MARINE HEAT FORM OR THE

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.519
HEAT WAVE HAS REFORMED INTO A

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.387
SINGLE. YET MUCH SMALLER

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.423
FEATURE AS COMPARED TO THE

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.659
MAXIMUM SIZE IT ONCE HAD- IN

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.528
THESE OBSERVATIONS IN AUGUST

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.829
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND THAT

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.764
THIS KIND OF HEAT HAS MOVED

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.967
FARTHER OFF SHORE RATHER THAN

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.635
MOVING NEAR SHORE WHICH WERE

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:23.703
SOME OF THE DYNAMICS WE SAW

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:26.839
LAST GO AROUND THEY DON'T

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:27.373
APPEAR TO BE ESTABLISHING

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.775
THEMSELVES. THIS GO AROUND. SEE

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.309
SERVICE TEMPERATURES HAVE

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:31.677
COOLED ACROSS MUCH OF THE NEAR

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.746
SHORE AREAS FOR THE ENTIRE

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:36.449
UNITED STATES WEST COAST. BOTH

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.783
SOUTHERN OREGON AND NORTHERN

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.386
CALIFORNIA. ARE CURRENTLY

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:41.354
EXPERIENCING COLDER THAN

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.522
AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. UNLIKE

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.758
THE BLOB OF TWO THOUSAND

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:46.292
FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN WHICH

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.594
REMAINED NEAR THE COAST. ALL

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.596
DURING THE FALL AND DURING THE

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.598
WINTER. THE CURRENT MARINE

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.667
HEATWAVE IS RETREATED TO A

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:55.635
LOCATION MUCH FURTHER OFF

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:59.639
SHORE. THIS IS BETTER NEWS THAN

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.273
MANY OF US ALL REPORTED IN THE

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.142
MEDIA ABOUT A MONTH AGO. NOW OF

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.377
COURSE THE CONDITIONS ARE GONNA

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:07.013
BECOME INCREASINGLY DYNAMIC AS

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.080
THROUGH THE TYPICAL CYCLE OF

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:10.316
FALL AND WINTER STORMS. AS

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.517
THOSE STORMS BEGIN FORMING IN

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:14.954
THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC BUT ON-THIS TOPIC I THINK THE NEWS IS

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.690
BETTER COMPARED TO WARS-

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.759
PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE FACTORS

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:20.393
IN THE ORIGINAL REPORTING ABOUT

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.828
A MONTH AGO. NEXT TOPIC YOU

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.498
ASKED ME TO COVER IS THE TOPIC

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.166
OF DISASTER RELIEF FUND

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.436
DISTRIBUTION. AS ME- YOU YOUR

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.405
LEADERSHIP OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.673
LEGISLATURE OUR CONGRESSIONAL

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.542
REPRESENTATIVES. BOTH GOOD

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.044
BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.512
OUR DEPARTMENT OF WORKED REALLY

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:41.414
HARD TO PROVIDE DISASTER RELIEF

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.481
FOR AFFECTED FISHERY

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.017
COMMUNITIES WE'RE ON THE BACK

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.819
END OF A LOT OF THIS WORK THE

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.321
MONEY'S COME IN AND HERE'S

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.889
PROBABLY THE MOST CURRENT

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.558
UPDATE. SO THE FINAL BATCH OF

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:53.125
PAYMENTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:56.362
MAIL. EFFECTED FISHER MEN AND

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.664

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.266
WORKING ON THE MITIGATION

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.902
PORTION OF THE DISASTER RELIEF.

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.371
SO OUR TOTAL PAY OUT SO FAR I

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.272
BELIEVE IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.109
TWO. MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:12.278
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND DUNGENESS

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.347
CRAB TOTAL WAS TWENTY TWO

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.215
MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.318
DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE ABOUT

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:19.952
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WENT TO

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.187
THE ROCK CROWDS ROCK CRAP

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.989
SECTOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW IS

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.790
GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE LIMITED

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:25.791
DOWN INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.960
AROUND THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. SO

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:28.961
THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.197
DRAFTING THE REQUEST FOR

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:32.431
PROPOSAL AROUND THAT MITIGATION

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:35.668
ASPECT. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.036
OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:37.670
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

HEALTH FOR US SPENDING PLAN. TO

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.274
IMPROVE THEIR LAB CAPABILITIES

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.309
AND THAT SPENDING PLAN I

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.111
BELIEVE IS THE THIS IS AT THE

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:47.813
PACIFIC STATE. RAIN FISHERIES

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.448

CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.152
REAPPOINTMENT TO. SO THAT'S

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:53.719
THAT'S OUR QUICK SUMMARY ON

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.856
DISASTER RELIEF. YOU ALSO ASKED

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.691
THAT I COVER WHAT THE

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.626
DEPARTMENT BELIEVES TO BE THE

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:02.361
DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.563
PRIORITIES AS WE'VE HEARD THEM

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.931
EXPRESS POSSIBLE PRIORITIES TO

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.067
US. HERE'S OUR IMPRESSION OF

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.769
THE THINGS THEY'D LIKE TO FOCUS

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.638
ON IN THE MEDIA FUTURE. NOT

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.206
SURPRISINGLY THEY REQUESTED A

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:15.775
MORE DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF THE

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.743
DUNGEON IS CRAB TRAP LIMIT

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.678
ACCOUNT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.148
ARE PERPETUALLY INTERESTED IN.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.616
THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.051
DEPARTMENT TO SPENDS THESE

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:28.487
FUNDS SO WE'RE VERY OKAY WITH

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:29.088
GOING TO THAT NOVEL NEXT LEVEL

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.891
TRANSPARENCY. THEY ALSO WANT TO

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:32.758
ENSURE I THINK THAT THE

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:35.094
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRACTS THAT

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:36.996
WE ARE ENGAGING AND ARE FOR THE

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.198
FULL APPROVED AMOUNT OF A

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:39.732
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.334
DOLLARS A YEAR. AND I THINK

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.669
THEY'RE FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:45.104
THEY HAVE AN NTEREST IN MAKING

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.539
SURE THAT THEIR TASK FORCE

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.941
MEETINGS CAN OCCUR. AS NEEDED

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:51.210
ON A REGULAR FREQUENCY AND THAT

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.845
TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.847
MEMBERS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:55.347
WE CAN ENSURE SUFFICIENT

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.250
PARTICIPATION. MY IMPRESSION IS

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:00.553
THE TASK FORCES SUPPORT OF OUR

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:01.487
DEPARTMENT AND OUR SISTER

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.023
HEALTH AGENCIES. STARTING TO

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.791
DEVELOP SOMETHING I BELIEVE

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.226
WE'RE CALLING KIND OF A BIO

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:10.062
TOXIN MANAGEMENT ZONE APPROACH.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:11.263
IF WE CAN BRING A LITTLE MORE

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.032
MORE CLARITY TO THE PARTS OF

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.800
THE OCEAN AND THAT WE WANT TO

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.735
FOCUS ON FOR MANAGEMENT. AND

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.238
HEALTH CONCERNS AND THINK ABOUT

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.774
DOING THOSE MANAGEMENT ZONES

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:22.441
CONNECTED TO REGULATIONS AROUND

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:24.643
OF THIS RACE OR ORDERS. SO

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.544
THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING I

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:27.113
THINK THEIR SUPPORT OF WE DO

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.581
WE'RE IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS OF

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:31.250
BUILDING THAT OUT WITH THE PH

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:31.851
BUT I EXPECT THAT'S WORK AHEAD

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:34.954
WITH THE TASK FORCE. OKAY SO

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.256
LET'S SHIFT THE CRAB AND START

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.425
WITH THE RECREATIONAL GRAB. SO

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:41.560
THE FOLKS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:42.027
A SPORT FISHERY NOT A

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:44.497
COMMERCIAL FISHERY. SO THE

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.165
UPDATE ON RECREATIONAL DUNGEONS

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:49.768
GRAB IS AS FOLLOWS. ON NOVEMBER

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:52.505
SECOND THE RECREATIONAL FISHERY

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.107
OPENED- WITH TO MOLECH ACID

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.009
HEALTH ADVISORIES FOR SHELTER

POINT IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. ON

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:12.591
NOVEMBER FIFTH OUR DEPARTMENT

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.627
DISCUSS CHANGES IN FRONT OF THE

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.962
FISH AND GAME COMMISSION

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:17.696
THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S MARINE

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:20.900
SOURCE RESOURCES COMMITTEE THAT

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:21.634
WE THINK SHOULD BE MADE TO THE

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.036
RECREATIONAL FISHERY. TO MOVE

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.272
IT INTO A MORE ANALOGOUS

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.541
APPROACH THAT THE COMMERCIAL

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:29.175
SECTOR IS TAKING IN ORDER TO BE

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:31.610
WILL SAVE. AS YOU KNOW IN THE

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.012
LAST YEAR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:34.246
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ENERGY

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.682
AROUND WHAT MIGHT BE CHANGES A

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:37.683
PRACTICE IN THE COMMERCIAL

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.119
FISHING SPACE. AND WE BELIEVE

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.754
IT THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPORTANT

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.789
TO PURSUE SIMILAR CHANGES IN

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.024
THE RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.159
SPACES WELL. THERE'S AN EQUITY

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.028
ISSUE BETWEEN THE TWO SECTORS

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:51.030
AND THERE'S ALSO I BELIEVE-

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:53.532
TRUE INTEREST IN BOTH SECTORS

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.099
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BE MORE

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.069
WILL SAVE. SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:57.937
TO OUR FISH AND GAME COMMISSION

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.972
WHY DO WE NEED TO GO THERE.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.840
THEY HAVE THE STATUTORY

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:02.875
MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THE

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.078
RECREATIONAL FISHERS. WE HAVE

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:06.645
THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY OVER

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:09.348
THE COMMERCIAL FISHERS. SO MY

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.417
IMPRESSION IS THAT- COMMISSIONS

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:14.019
MARINE RESOURCES COMMITTEE-

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.255
DISCUSSED A VARIETY OF OPTIONS

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:18.190
WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PLANS TO

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.025
PRESENT IN THE DECEMBER MEETING

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:20.492
WHICH I BELIEVE IS IN

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:23.796
SACRAMENTO. AROUND RULE MAKING

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:25.431
OPTIONS FOR CHANGING THE

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:28.801
RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY. SO

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:33.672
THAT BRINGS US TO- PROBABLY THE

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.874
MOST IMPORTANT UPDATE I HAVE.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.110
AND THAT'S AROUND THE OPENING

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:39.011
OF THE DUNGEON IS GRAB

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:41.247
COMMERCIAL FISHERY AND THE WAY

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.048
I STARTED THINK ABOUT IT IS TO

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.751
USE THIS IDEA OF RULES AND I'M

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:46.352
I MEAN IT KIND OF AN INFORMAL

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:48.887
SENSE. BUT TO HELP PEOPLE

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.656
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THREE SETS

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:54.126
OF RULES THAT ARE PRIDE TO

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:54.593
OPENING DUNGENESS CRAB

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.162
COMMERCIAL FISHERY. AND IT

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.498
TURNS OUT QUALITY TESTING THE

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.201
TESTING OF THE MEAT IN THE CRAB

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.602
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE FAT OR

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:06.672
SKINNY. IS ACTUALLY OUR OLDEST

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.074
AND ARGUABLY OUR MOST RELIABLE

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.310
SET OF RULES AT THIS POINT.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.279
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.080
THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA OREGON

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.749
AND WASHINGTON HAVE US TRY

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.150
STATE APPROACH TO THIS QUALITY

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.886
TESTING THE FLEET UNDERSTANDS

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.122
THESE RULES AND EVERY YEAR

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:24.423
WE'RE LOOKING AT TESTING OF

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.225
QUALITY DETERMINE OPENER SO

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.661
WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR. IS THE

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.963
CRAB QUALITY TESTING RESULTS IN

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.165
THE PROGNOSIS SOME THINGS WE'VE

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.267
DONE IS REALLY ONLY APPLICABLE

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.635
TO THE NORTHERN MANAGEMENT

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:39.405
AREAS SO THINK MENDOCINO ON UP

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.440
THE COAST. AND ON NOVEMBER

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:44.176
THIRTEENTH WE CAN CONFIRM WE

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.445
HAVE POOR CRAB QUALITY BASED ON

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.280
THESE TESTING PROTOCOLS. THE

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:51.050
TRI STATE KIND OF STRUCTURE A

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:54.887
GOOD READ TO DELAY THE DECEMBER

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:55.454
FIRST OPENER UNTIL DECEMBER

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.857
FIFTEENTH. SO WE'LL KEEP DOING

00:15:58.924 --> 00:15:59.391
TESTING THE FIRST WEEK OF

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.694
DECEMBER. WE WILL HAVE WHAT'S

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.696
CALLED FAIR START TRIGGERED IN

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.698
THE NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREA.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.466
AND WE'VE HAD A DIRECTOR MEMO

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.635
PUT OUT TO DELAY THE FISHERY DO

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.236
THE QUALITY WE'VE DONE OUR

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.338
TYPICAL INFORMATIONAL PRESS

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.807
RELEASE AND WITH POSTED ALL OF

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.442
OUR USUAL FREQUENTLY ASKED

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.010
QUESTION KIND OF OUR REACH

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.712
MATERIAL AROUND THE ISSUE OF

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:22.915
CRAP QUALITY. I WOULD ALSO SAY

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.183
WE THINK INTERNALLY THE

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:26.185
PROGNOSIS IS IFFY THE NOT SO

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:28.587
GOOD FOR THAT NORTHERN FISHERY

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.422
TO OPEN ON DECEMBER FIFTEENTH.

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:31.824
AND IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.859
CONTINUE TO BE DELAYED UNTIL

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.728
JANUARY. AND REMEMBER THIS IS

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.963
ALL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE ME

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.799
FOLLOWING THAT OLDEST AND MOST

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:41.400
RELIABLE SET OF RULES WE HAVE

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.769
AT THIS POINT. THAT REALLY

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.538
BRINGS US TO THE SECOND SET OF

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.172
RULES AND AGAIN I USE RULES IN

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.675
THE MORE INFORMAL SENSE. THIS

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.510
SET OF RULES IS AROUND THE

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.579
TOPIC OF THE MALL LIKE ACID.

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:56.749
IT'S NEWER FOR US IN SOME SENSE

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:57.316
COMPARED TO THE CRAP QUALITY

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:00.319
TESTING RULES. AND IT'S REALLY

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:01.820
ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:04.089
FLEET AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:04.623
OUR SISTER PUBLIC HEALTH

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.158
AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.826
NOT A PRODUCT OUT IN THE

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.396
MARKETPLACE. THAT PUTS

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:10.963
CALIFORNIA'S AT RISK FROM A

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:13.532
PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. SO

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.633
AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.769
NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREA AND

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:18.737
THIS IS UP YOU KNOW FOR BRAG

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.507
USE ALL AREA AND WHAT WE HAVE.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:25.110
AS A NEED THERE IS TO GET ONE

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.413
ADDITIONAL CLEAN TEST THE CLEAR

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.448
AND AVOID ANY DEMO LIKE ACID

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:30.482
DELAYS IN THE NORTHERN

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.352
MANAGEMENT AREA. AND I BELIEVE

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:33.852
THE RESULTS ARE EXPECTED

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.455
NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND. SO THEN%

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:39.091
KIND OF MOVING SOUTHWARD WE

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.926
HAVE A CENTRAL MANAGEMENT AREA

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.295
AND THIS IS AROUND THE DUXBURY

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:43.829
REEF POINT REYES AREA YOU

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.232
MENTIONED IT. ON NOVEMBER FIFTH

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.268
WE HAD A SAMPLE OF ONE CRAB

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.236
OVER THE LIMIT WE IN OUR

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:52.671
PARLANCE KIND OF SHORT HANDED

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.208
SAY A HOT CRAP IT'S OVER THE

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:56.809
THRESHOLD OF THIRTY SIX PARTS

00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:00.612
PER MILLIMETER. MILLION AND SO

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.815
WE HAVE SINCE THAT NOVEMBER

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.317
FIFTH SAMPLE OF A HOT CROWD WE

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:08.487
HAVE OUR FIRST REQUIRED CLEAN

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:09.054
SAMPLE THE CAME IN LATE LAST

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:12.257
WEEK. AND WE NEED ONE

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:14.159
ADDITIONAL CLEAN SAMPLE BEFORE

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.795
WE CAN OPEN THE AREA SO THESE

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:17.296
ARE RULES AROUND OPENING

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:19.431
CLOSING BASED ON THE TESTING.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.900
WE COLLECTED OUR SECOND SET A

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.435
SAMPLES YESTERDAY ON MONDAY THE

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.370
EIGHTEENTH. WE'VE DELIVERED

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.073
THEM TO OUR SISTER AGENCIES LAB

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.642
WE HAVE SOME INTERNAL PROTOCOLS

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:31.977
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN IS TO MAKE

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.213
SURE WE'RE HITTING ALL OF OUR

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:34.780
PROCESSING MARKERS TODAY AND

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:38.116
TOMORROW. FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.685
AND WHAT WE'VE TOLD THE ENTIRE

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.920
FLEET I BELIEVE THE MEDIA AND

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.889
EVERYBODY ELSE IS WATCHING. IS

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.090
WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.459
NOTIFICATION NO LATER THAN SIX

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:52.631
PM TOMORROW. ABOUT THIS LAST

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.700
SAMPLE AND WE BASICALLY COULD

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:57.669
END UP WITH THREE SCENARIOS AND

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:58.804
WE'VE ALSO KIND OF BROADCAST

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.772
THESE LIKELY SCENARIOS THE

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.975
FLEET SO THEY CANNOT PLANNING

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:03.542
CERTAINTY AS MUCH AS THAT'S

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:06.778
AVAILABLE IN THIS CLIMATE. ONE

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:07.346
SCENARIO IS THE SAMPLE COMES

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:09.648
BACK CLEAN. WE'VE GOT AN

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:13.418
OPENING WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.988
ANOTHER SCENARIO IS THE SAMPLES

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.689
WE CAN'T GET THEM PROCESSED

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.925
AGAINST THE SIX PM MARKER. THE

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.461
MACHINE COULD BREAK DOWN. YOU

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.795
KNOW SOME OTHER ACT OF GOD

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:25.597
COULD INTERVENE AND WE JUST

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.566
CAN'T GET THEM PROCESS OKAY SO

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.835
RIGHT NOW WE'RE HITTING ALL OF

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:30.402
OUR INTERNAL MARKERS FOR OUR

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.238
EXPEDITED APPROACH. AND UNDER

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.140
THIS CAN'T GET IT PROCESS THE

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.708
SAMPLE RESULTS AREN'T AVAILABLE

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.278
BY SIX O'CLOCK TOMORROW. YOU

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.680
COULD SEE A COUPLE OF KIND OF

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.181
SUBSTANCE AREAS WE WOULD BE

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:46.318
DELAYING THE OPENER IN AN AREA

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:48.086
FROM PILLAR POINT TO POINT

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.821
RACES. FAIR START WOULD BE

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.490
INVOKED AND THEN AT A

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.192
SUBSEQUENT MOMENT WE MIGHT

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:54.726
EITHER BE ABLE TO SAY THE

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.862
SAMPLE IS COME BACK CLEAN. IF

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.730
THAT WERE THE CASE WOULD STILL

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.332
APPLY SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.501
TO THE FLEET. FOR PRE SOAK IN

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.303
CERTAIN AREAS OR THAT SAMPLE

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:07.039
COULD COME BACK HOT. IT COMES

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.141
BACK HOT THEN WE NEED TO

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:10.642
CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF CLEAN

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.946
SAMPLES BEFORE WE CAN OPEN AND

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:15.314
WE WOULD ALSO BE USING THE

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.684
SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE- FOR

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.320
PRE SOAK- INFORMATION. AND THE

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:24.356
LAST SCENARIO. IS BY SIX

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.491
O'CLOCK TOMORROW WE PROCESS THE

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.092
SAMPLE AND IT COMES BACK ABOUT

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.994
THE LIMIT TAUGHT. AT WHICH

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.762
POINT WE WOULD DELAY IN THE

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:33.098
AREA FROM PILLAR POINT OF POINT

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.466
REYES AND WE WOULD HAVE FAIR

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.368
START INVOKED AND THEN WE WOULD

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.003
NEED TWO CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.938
CLEAN SAMPLES REQUIRED WE WOULD

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.474
AGAIN GIVE SEVENTY TWO HOUR

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.075
NOTICE ONCE WERE READY TO OPEN

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.111
FOR PRE SO. THAT'S A LOT. IT'S

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.146
PARTICULARLY A LOT FOR THE

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:49.014
AVERAGE CITIZEN WHO'S

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.250
LISTENING. IT'S FAMILIAR FOR

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:53.385
THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN THIS

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:56.154
INTENSE SPACE- BUT I'M

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.457
SYMPATHETIC FOR THE GENERAL

00:20:58.523 --> 00:20:59.024
PUBLIC THIS TRYING TO TRACK

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.360
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO THE

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.195
LAST SET OF RULES THAT ARE

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:05.464
ACTUALLY THE NEWEST FOR US IN

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.933
SOME SENSE AND ARGUABLY THEIR

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.769
THE LEAST PREDICTABLE. SET OF

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:13.138
RULES AROUND THE OPENING FACTOR

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:16.308
OUR MARINE LIFE ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.543
IT'S BEEN WELL DISCUSS YOU'VE

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.278
HOSTED SEVERAL WORKSHOPS AND

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.613
HEARINGS ABOUT IT THE FACT OF

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.584
THE MATTER IS. WE CHERISH OUR

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.184
ICONIC MARINE MAMMALS THAT ARE

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:30.188
OFF OUR SHORE. AND WE HIGHLY

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.224
VALUE A SUSTAINABLE DUNGENESS

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.726
CRAB FISHERY AND I FOR ONE AM

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:35.694
LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A MOM

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.396
MY THANKSGIVING PLACE. THE

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.965
DEPARTMENT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:43.835
ACHIEVING BOTH THOSE SCHOOLS.

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:46.104
WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:46.672
WE'RE GOING THROUGH FOR THE

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:51.076
FIRST TIME. IT'S GOT SOME FLAWS

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:51.610
IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:56.014
WORKING. WE'VE FACILITATED A

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.917
WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS ACROSS

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.152
ALL THIS CONSTITUENTS INTERESTS

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:02.954
BASE AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:04.523
MOMENTS WHERE WERE CONVENING

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.558
THEM WE'RE LOOKING AT BEST

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.393
AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE'RE

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.529
DOING A RISK ASSESSMENT AND

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.731
THAT STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:15.233
IS ADVISING THE DEPARTMENT. ON

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.102
WHETHER WE SHOULD OPEN THE

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.604
SEASON OR DELAYED THIS SEASON

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.306
BASED ON THE REST TO WELL

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.108
ENTANGLEMENTS MARINE MAMMAL

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.543
ENTANGLEMENTS SO ON NOVEMBER

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:26.678
FIFTH BASED ON THIS STRUCTURED

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:29.448
PROCESS. INFORMED BY

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:30.849
RECOMMENDATIONS THE CAME FROM

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:33.118
THAT GROUP AND ALL THE COMMENTS

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.720
DURING A FORTY EIGHT HOUR

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:37.222
WINDOW. I ANNOUNCED WE WERE

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:40.025
GOING TO DO A SEVEN DAY DELAY.

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:41.927
TO WELL RISK SOUTH OF THE

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.696
MENDOCINO CINEMA COUNTY LINE.

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:45.831
SO INSTEAD OF OPENING ON

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:48.333
NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH. WE'RE NOW

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.801
SET TO OPEN IN A COUPLE OF

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.671
DAYS. AND WE HAVE OUR PRE SOAK

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.940
READY TO START AT SIX AM ON

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:57.642
THURSDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.177
THE BASIS FOR THAT SEVEN DAY

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.379
DELAY WAS WE COULD SEE A LARGE

00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:02.748
NUMBER F WHALES STILL OUT IN

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:04.416
THE FISHING GROUNDS. WE DON'T

00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:06.384
HAVE A HISTORICAL RECORD IN THE

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:07.352
SPACE TO TELL YOU IF THEY'RE

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:10.555
MORE OR LESS PER SE WHAT WE CAN

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:12.791
IDENTIFIES PRESENCE OR ABSENCE

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.893
AND WE'RE SEEING. CONGREGATIONS

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.728
STILL IN THE FISHING GROUNDS SO

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.631
WE PUSH THIS DELAY TO PROVIDE

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.566
ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE WHALES

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:22.267
TO SWIM SOUTH ON THEIR

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.903
MIGRATION YET. SECURING AN

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.571
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FLEET TO

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:28.240
GET THE PRODUCT INTO THE

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:30.809
THANKSGIVING MARKET WHICH IS AN

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:31.243
IMPORTANT TRADITION

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:31.843
PARTICULARLY HERE IN NORTHERN

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.379
CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME TELL YOU

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:37.449
ONE LAST UPDATE AND THEN STOP.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:39.751
SO AT OUR DEPARTMENT THIS IS A

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:41.853
NEW EXPERIENCE FOR US LEADING

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.055
THIS KIND OF ADVISORY GROUP

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.690
THROUGH STRUCTURE DECISION

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:46.258
MAKING AROUND MARINE MAMMAL

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:50.228
ENTANGLEMENTS. WE MADE A

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.963
DECISION A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.732
THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.501
GATHER INFORMATION SO YESTERDAY

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:57.035
FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE THIS

00:23:57.102 --> 00:24:00.138
SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS REASON.

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:00.605
WE PUT ONE OF OUR OWN

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:03.942
DEPARTMENT PLANES IN THE AIR.

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:04.476
ALONG WITH SOME QUALIFIED

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:07.045
SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.680
HISTORICALLY WE'VE RELIED ON

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:10.649
OTHER AGENCIES FLYING THEIR

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.484
PLANES TO GATHER INFORMATION WE

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.452
WANTED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.054
SITUATION SO I THINK THIS IS A

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:20.525
POSITIVE STORY WE ARE COMMITTED

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:21.660
TO REAL TIME MONITORING TO

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:23.461
INFORM DECISION MAKING. WHAT

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.463
ARE FOLKS LANDED YESTER DAY

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.065
THEY LET US KNOW AT THE

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.867
LEADERSHIP LEVEL THEY STILL SEE

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:31.403
THE PRESENCE OF WALES NEAR THE

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:32.804
GULF OF THE FOR AIRLINES THEY

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:34.739
STILL SEE WHALES OFF POINT

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:37.742
REYES AND SOME DOWN IN HALF

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:38.276
MOON BAY. IN PARTS OF THE

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:40.879
FISHING GROUNDS. SO WE KNOW

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:42.414
THAT THERE'S CONTINUED PRESENCE

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.282
OF THESE WELLS. AT THIS MOMENT

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.718
WE DON'T THINK IT WARRANTS ANY

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:47.352
ADDITIONAL DELAY WE'RE GOING TO

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:51.056
STICK WITH THE OPENER. BUT WE

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:54.292
ARE GOING TO BE ADVISING TODAY

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:54.893
AND IN THE COMING DAYS IN VERY

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.463
CLEAR TERMS. WE KNOW THE FLEA

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.633
CAN FISH RESPONSIBLY THEY HAVE

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.201
COMMITTED TO US THEY WILL FISH

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:06.037
RESPONSIBLY WE EXPECT THE FLEET

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:08.940
THE FISH RESPONSIBLE. WE'RE

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.342
GOING TO KEEP OUR PLANE IN THE

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.444
AIR AS MUCH AS THE WEATHER

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.712
RESOURCES PILOT AVAILABILITY

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:16.114
ALLOWS US. WE THINK WE COULD BE

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.816
EVOLVING TO A FUTURE WHERE

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:18.783
WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.686
FROM THE AIR. AND WERE RELAYING

00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:22.721
IT TO SOME FORM OF UNIFIED

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.522
COMMAND ON THE GROUND THAT'S

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:26.124
ADVISING OUR PARTNERS IN THE

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:28.026
FLEET WHERE THEY SHOULD AND

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.828
SHOULDN'T GO WHAT THEY MAY AND

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.162
MAY NOT WANT TO AVOID RELATIVE

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:33.131
TO PRESENCE OF WALES WE'RE

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:33.865
GONNA HAVE TO INVOLVED IN THAT

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:36.268
KIND OF ADAPTABILITY. AND WE

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.502
NEED TO FLEE TO THIS

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.204
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:39.971
KNOW IF WE HAVE AN

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:42.474
ENTANGLEMENT. I HAVE A SERIES

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.875
OF ADDITIONAL RISK ASSESSMENTS

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:46.111
COMING UP AND I MAY CONCLUDE

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.112
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:48.647
CLOSE THE FISHERY PERMANENTLY

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:51.583
FOR THE SEASON SO THAT'S WHAT'S

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.183
GOING ON ON THIS LAST PIECE OF

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.219
INFORMATION. IT'S BEEN

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:56.421
COMPLICATED EVERY YEAR OF MY

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:57.923
EIGHT YEARS AS DIRECTOR ON CRAB

00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:59.224
OPENERS AND IS JUST GETTING

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.493
MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:02.093
THESE THREE SETS OF RULES AND

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.163
HOW THEY INTERFACE. NO THANK

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.064
YOU SO MUCH AS A DRESS FROM

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:06.531
STRUCTURE SO IT JUST

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:08.967
PERSPECTIVE WEISS. HI THE

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:11.236
ABSOLUTE STORM THAT WE SAW IN

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:12.570
REGARDS TO THE WARM WATER INTO

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:15.974
MùT GAS IT- BACK IN

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.676
200-015-2000 SIXTEEN. AND YOUR

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.411
PERSPECTIVE I AND THEY WERE

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:22.447
ALSO ASKED MR HE'S WELL. WERE

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:24.082
IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE ON THE

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.283
DEMO GAS AND LEVELS UNDERSTAND

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.751
WE STILL HAVE SOME HOT TESTS

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:28.186
OUT THERE BUT MUCH BETTER

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.388
SHAPE. THAN WE WERE OVER THE

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.290
LAST SEVERAL YEARS IF YA CAN

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:33.925
JUST QUICKLY- COMING ON THAT

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.126
AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:37.762
ON- ON WHEELS I AGREE THAT

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:38.897
GENERAL CHARACTERS STATION

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.132
WHERE BETTER. WITH REGARDS TO

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.201
DEMONIC ACID TODAY THAN WE WERE

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.770
IN THE PEAK OF THE WARM WATER

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:50.175
BLOOM AND THAT PRIOR. TO MARK

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:50.742
ACID INCIDENT. I WOULD AGREE

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:54.446
WITH THAT TOO. THANK YOU SO

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:56.047
MUCH A- WALES AND THEN I'M ALSO

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.215
GOING TO ASK A AND I KNOW WE

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.149
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM. A MISS

00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.718
ROBIN TIME AND MISS RIGHT WINE

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:00.719
BUT HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:01.286
THEM AND OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:01.920
YOU. MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION AS

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:03.989
WELL O THAT MISTER DIRECTOR

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.156
TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ISSUE ON

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:08.426
WHALES- SO YOU YOU'D SAID THAT

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:09.828
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN UP

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:11.629
IN THE AIR. YOU'RE GONNA

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:17.836
CONTINUOUSLY. ON THE OCEAN IS

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.471
WELL WHAT WHAT TYPE OF BACK AND

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:21.740
FORTH GOES- GOES ON BETWEEN

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:22.273
YOUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.212
FLEETS. WE ARE IN REGULAR

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:29.247
COORDINATION WITH THE FLEA AND

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.383
THAT HAS BEEN TRUE FOR YEARS.

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:33.251
WHAT I THINK WILL BE NEW IN THE

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.086
NEXT TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:38.356
HOURS SEVEN DAYS TEN DAYS. IS

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:38.957
THIS IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT IDEA

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:43.161
WE HAVE. IF WE CAN MARSHAL THE

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:44.963
RESOURCES SWIMMING WEATHER

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.631
DOESN'T KEEP US OUT OF THE YEAR

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:47.732
AND WE'VE GOT PILOT

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.434
AVAILABILITY WE'D LIKE TO GET

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.770
UP IN THE AIR SO WE HAVE A GOOD

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.439
VISUAL OF PRESENCE AND ABSENCES

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.941
THE WELLS ARE MOVING SOUTH. WE

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.877
DON'T YET KNOW AND I THINK

00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:00.512
LATER TODAY AND TOMORROW WE'RE

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:01.546
PROBABLY GOING TO HUDDLE WITH

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:04.215
MR OPPENHEIM. HOW TO FIND A

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.784
PRINCIPLE POINT OF CONTACT IN

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.952
THE FLEET THAT'S ON THE GROUND.

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.220
AND THEN USE THEIR PRETTY

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.523
REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:12.757
FISHING VESSELS WHILE THEY'RE

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.793
OUT IN THE WATER. I THINK

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:15.427
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:16.394
PROBLEM SOLVING THE NEXT DAY OR

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.897

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.407
AGAIN ASSUMING WHETHER IN SEES-

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.376
WE WILL ALSO LIKELY BE PUTTING

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.977
SOME OF OUR PATROL BOATS ON THE

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:33.845
WATER AND THAT'S AN ELEMENT OF

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:36.414
COMMUNICATION CONNECTIVITY. NOT

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.216
A ONE OF THE ASPECTS WE WILL

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:41.052
ALWAYS HAVE IS. IF THE DATA.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:45.790

MEASURES WE ALSO ARE COGNIZANT

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.972
OF DOING IT IN A WAY. THAT

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:01.573
DOESN'T CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:05.643
RISK. AND COGNIZANT OF AN

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.679
ORDERLY FISHERY OUT IN THE

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.380
WATER WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.548

THIS MORNING ABOUT. THE

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.908
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT KIND OF

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.976
SPATIAL AWARENESS AND CERTAINLY

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.245
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER AT THIS

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.246
VERY MOMENT BUT THE

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.015
CONVERSATION IS GOING ON

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:19.651
CERTAINLY AT FIRST BLUSH. THE

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.219
NOTION THAT KNOWING WHERE WELLS

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.054
ARE LOCATED IN REAL TIME IS AN

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.856
ASSET. IT'S A NEW KIND OF

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.357
INFORMATION AND WE NEED TO BE

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:28.159
CAREFUL THAT THE WAY THAT WE

VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE USING

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:40.338
THIS AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE-

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.973
AND AS WE GATHER MORE

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.010
INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW HOW WE

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.780
CAN USE SPATIAL DATA. WE CAN

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.448
HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.550
WHAT THAT MEANS ON THE WATER

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:53.985
FOR FISHERMEN BUT I THINK IN

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.720

GROUP IN THE DEPARTMENT ON THE

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:46.370
CONSERVATION PLAN- ULTIMATELY

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.771
TO GET THE IN N. H. I.

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:51.275
INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. WE HAVE

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.576
BEEN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:56.480
AGENCY. TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.916
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKELY

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.385
TO APPROVE. AND THEN OF COURSE

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.621
IS PART OF THAT REQUIREMENT IS

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.922
TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS SUCH

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:07.658
THAT WHEN WE- IMPLEMENT THE

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:09.860
CONSERVATION PLAN UNDER THE I.

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.362
T. P. WE THE DEPARTMENT CAN

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.197
ACTUALLY. PROMULGATE THAT

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.599
ACTIVITY THROUGH RULES SO. AS

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.935
YOU'VE HEARD WE SHARED WITH THE

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.270
WORKING GROUP IN SEPTEMBER OUR

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:22.406
TRASH- REGULATORY PROPOSAL TO

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.941
BUILD THAT. A MANAGEMENT

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.776
FRAMEWORK WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.445
INPUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS ON

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.013
THAT WERE MAKING SOME MINOR

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:33.350
MODIFICATIONS. WE HOPE TO-

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:35.886
DISTRIBUTE A DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:37.187
THAT COMING LATE WINTER EARLY

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:40.057
SPRING. ON OUR DRAFT PROPOSALS

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.091
FOR THAT RULE MAKING THAT WILL

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.860
BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.228
WILL BE THE GUIDING RULES AND

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.797
AS YOU KNOW THE IT WILL REPLACE

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:49.667
THE STATUTORY. STRUCTURE THAT

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:50.935
THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:52.102
MANAGE- MARINE LIFE

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.204
ENTANGLEMENT SO IT'S A PRETTY

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:54.772
IMPORTANT RULE MAKING TO PAY

00:42:54.838 --> 00:43:00.077
ATTENTION TO. WE ARE STILL

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.478
DEVELOPING TOOLS TO HELP ASSESS

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:06.684
RISK. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.320
THE MODELING WORK TO IDENTIFY

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:11.522
TRENDS IN OCEAN CONDITIONS AND

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:13.924
PARTICULARLY RELATED TO FORAGE

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.993
AS WE SAW YESTERDAY OUR

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.129
OBSERVERS BY PLANE- WELLS LOVE

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:22.599
ANCHOVIES IT'S- IN THE WORKING

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.901
GROUP PARLANCE THIS IS AN

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.536
ANCHOVY YOU'RE NOT A CREEL

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.371
YEAR. AND WHEN WE HAVE ANCHOVY

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:28.872
YEARS THE HUMPBACKS IN

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.275
PARTICULAR HANG AROUND LONGER

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.076
AND TEND TO BE CLOSE TO SHORE

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:32.943
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.579
ANCHOVIES THAT IS A HIGHER RISK

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:36.847
ENVIRONMENT THAN WHAT WE WOULD

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:39.249
CALL A CREEL YEAR WHICH TENDS

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:40.017
TO KEEP THE WHALES FURTHER

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:42.486
OFFSHORE. THOUGHT DEVELOPING

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:43.587
THOSE TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.456
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WAS

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:47.725
MENTIONED HERE EARLIER ONE OF

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.059
OUR GOALS IS TO GIVE THE FLEET

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.328
SOME SENSE OF PREDICTABILITY SO

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.430
THEY CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:55.799
RATHER THAN THE POTENTIAL CHAOS

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.401
OF AT THE LAST MINUTE KNOWING

00:43:57.468 --> 00:44:00.537
WHERE THEY CAN GO FISH SO

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:03.907
THAT'S A LONG TERM PROJECT. THE

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.109
OTHER THING AS- SUSAN ROCKLINE

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:06.977
POINTED OUT IS HOW TO FISH.

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:09.646
WITH GEAR OR METHODS THAT JUST

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:12.016
WON'T CATCH WHALES. SO WHETHER

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.617
IT'S GETTING RID OF SLACK LINE

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.452
WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:16.520
SUSPICION IS CERTAINLY

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:19.123
CONTRIBUTES TO ENTANGLEMENT-

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.091
WERE INVESTIGATING AS YOU KNOW

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:23.060
ROLL BLISS TECHNOLOGIES THERE

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:25.396
STILL A WAYS OUT I BELIEVE SO

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:26.997
WE'RE LOOKING AT WORKING WITH

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.233
INNOVATORS THE FISHERMAN WAS

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:30.334
ALSO POINTED OUT THERE VERY

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.469
INNOVATIVE BUNCH. WERE TRYING

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:35.205
TO FACILITATE THEIR INNOVATION-

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:37.241
THROUGH PROGRAMS TO GET TESTING

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:40.511
OUT ON THE WATER THIS SEASON.

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.078
TO HELP DEVELOP LESS WELL

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:44.581
STICKY GEAR- AND I THINK I'LL

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:45.549
LEAVE IT AT THAT UNLESS THERE'S

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:46.683
ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS REST

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.253
OF TALK ABOUT- THIS IS GONNA BE

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:49.953
AN ISSUE NOT JUST HERE IN

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.255
CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:52.856
WEST COAST IN JUST ENHANCE

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:55.059
COORDINATION FOR EXAMPLE. ON

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.761
THE SPECIFIC ISSUE- WITH ORGAN

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.763
IN WASHINGTON IS CAME UP AT THE

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.597
COMMISSION MEETING THAT WE ARE

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.499
AT AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:03.634
OF IT HAVE UNIFORM STANDARDS I

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.568
WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:07.538
MOUTH. BUT I CAN'T CHOCOLATE

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:10.474
ABOUT THAT YES SURE. FOR A FEW

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.443
YEARS NOW- BECAUSE THE TRISTATE

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:14.278
WHALES POPPED UP ON THAT-

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:17.881
AGENDA COUPLE YEARS AGO- TO BE

00:45:17.948 --> 00:45:18.882
FRANK IT FIRST OREGON

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:20.217
WASHINGTON REALLY THINK THEY

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.685
HAD A WEL PROBLEM UNTIL THEY

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:24.555
DID. AND SO THEY- AS A RESULT

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.290
OF THAT WE FORMED A MUCH

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:27.791
STRONGER PARTNERSHIP WE ARE

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:28.959
WORKING TOGETHER. THROUGH

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:32.096
ROUTINE- CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.363
WHAT METHODS ARE LOOKING AT

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.333
REGULATIONS. OREGON WASHINGTON

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.469
ARE BOTH LOOKING AT POT LIMITS.

00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:40.003
DURING HIGH RISK PERIODS WHERE

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.638
THEY WOULD REDUCE THE PERCENT

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:43.073
OF GEAR THAT EACH PERMIT HOLDER

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.175
CATFISH. AS A WAY TO REDUCE

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.578
LINES IN THE WATER- THEY'RE

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:49.213
ALSO LOOKING AT A SPECIAL

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:50.981
PERMIT FOR THOSE ONE A FISSION

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:52.783
THE SPRING TIME THAT WOULD.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.286
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF FISHERMEN

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:56.887
AND GEAR SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:59.756
ALL KINDS OF TECHNIQUES.

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:00.757
WASHINGTON REQUIRES A

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:24.047
INTERACTION- WITH- EACH

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.282
ASSOCIATIONS ULTIMATELY IT'S

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.250
GOING TO BE THE DEPARTMENTAL

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:28.217
DECISION WITH THE

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.786
ADMINISTRATION TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.988
THE FINAL BUT CAN YOU JUST TALK

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.589
TO US ABOUT THAT AND HOW THAT

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:37.226
OUT REACH WOULD LOOK LIKE. AS

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:37.760
YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THE-

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.730
STATE PERMIT. OF COURSE THEY'LL

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:41.497
BE A RICH. WE NEED THE INPUT

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.965
FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS WHETHER

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:43.599
THEY'RE IN THE COMMERCIAL FLEET

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:47.703
SECTOR. AARON ACADEMIA OR THAT

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.472

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.574
SISTER FEDERAL AGENCY THE

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:52.108
NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:55.778
SERVICE. SO THE OTHER THING I'D

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.713
SAY IS LISTENING TO MISS ROUTE

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.749
ONES TESTIMONY I ACTUALLY THINK

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.617
SHE AND I SHARE SOME CORE

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:04.487
VALUES. FOR EXAMPLE. I HEARD

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.888
THE VALUE EXPRESSED OF

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.958
INCLUSIVENESS I AGREE. IT'S

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.893
PRETTY DIVERSE GROUP THAT

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.495
EXISTS WITHIN- WORKGROUP WE'VE

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.997
ESTABLISHED AND IT INCLUDES THE

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:19.802
ASSOCIATION. AND I THINK FORMAL

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.270
RECOGNITION OF THE

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:24.040
ASSOCIATION'S ACTUAL ATTORNEY.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.609
AS ONE OF THEIR SPOKESPERSONS

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:27.243
AND THE WORKER SO INCLUSIVENESS

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.513
I'M FOR. I THINK ANOTHER SHARED

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.416
VALUES TRANSPARENCY. I AGREE

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.251
WITH MISS ROB WIND THAT THE

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:37.787
WORKING GROUP FUNCTIONS BEST.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.422
IF PARTIES ARE BRINGING BEST

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.757
AVAILABLE SCIENCE OPENLY. AND

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:44.293
DISCUSSING IT TRANSPARENTLY

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.828
THAT COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:48.731
IS A REASON WHY I WANTED TO

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:49.332
DAYLIGHT THIS MORNING THAT WE

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:49.799
HAD A PLAN IN THE YEAR

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:53.069
YESTERDAY. AND I THINK A THIRD

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:53.603
SHARED VALUES IS ACTUALLY

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:56.239

TIME THE WORKING GROUP REACHED

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:09.452
CONSENSUS I BELIEVE. THAT THE

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.220
RISK THEY SAW FOR WILL

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.955

AVENUE BY WHICH GROUND TREE

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.422
THING THE REGULATORY

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.990
DISCUSSION. IS ACCOMPLISHED. I

WITHOUT THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:49.638
QUESTION THE STATE CAN'T

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:52.508
PROCEED. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:55.111
WE RECONCILE POTENTIALLY-

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.479
DIFFERING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:57.847
MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.048
AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.684
WHICH BOTH EVALUATE IMPACTS AND

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.353
STOCKS OF MARINE IMPACTS TO

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.522
MARINE MAMMALS AND STOCKS OF

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.089
MARINE MAMMALS. IN DIVERGENT

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:11.394
WAYS. IN SOME WAYS THE MARINE

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.896
MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT TIED IT

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.131
PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.099
IN OTHER WAYS IT DOES NOT AND

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.534
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.503
THE WAY THAT IT. EVALUATES AND

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:22.972
CONTEMPLATES IMPACTS TO THE

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:25.241
POPULATION AS A WHOLE AND-

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:27.910
JEOPARDY OR NO JEOPARDY TO THAT

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.479
POPULATION IT IS DIFFERENT.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.848
RECONCILING THOSE ISSUES IS KEY

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:36.252
AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM STAFF

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.320
ABOUT THIS. LEADERSHIP THERE AS

WELL I KNOW THEY KNOW THIS IS A

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.425
TOP PRIORITY BUT UNTIL THEY CAN

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.360
PROVIDE GUIDANCE THE STATE. WE

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:47.129
CAN MOVE FORWARD SO I'M USING

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.898
THIS PLATFORM IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.332
SHOULD SOMEONE OUT THERE IN THE

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.767
UNIVERSITY LISTENING THAT WE

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:54.403
NEED THIS NOW AND CERTAINLY THE

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.605
STATE PROCESS SEES TO ENCOURAGE

THE STATE OF SOME ON ITS REPORT

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:15.777
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.045
NOT TO SPEND MILLIONS OF

INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON FOR

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.261
REMEDIATION IMPAIR SITES TO

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:14.696
OFTEN MANAGERS FOCUS ON

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:15.930
RESTORATION DYSFUNCTIONAL

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.899
HABITAT IN PLACE A PASSENGER

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.467
WERE PARTIAL SOLUTION SUCH AS

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:20.268
ROAD CULVERT OR EVEN ARTS

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.670
CULVERTS ARE YOU ARE

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:22.937
CONSIDERED. THESE PROJECTS

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.706
ALMOST ALWAYS INVALUABLE IN

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.508
THAT INEVITABLY FAIL TO SOME

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:27.809
EXTENT BECAUSE THEY IMPEDE

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.744
NATURAL GM GEOMORPHIC AN

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.046
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.414
IMPLEMENTING BRIDGES SIMPLE

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.483
SPENDS BERRIER SITES IS

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.017
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST. PATH

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:38.520
FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO END MY

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:39.120
CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS WITH HOW

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.488
IT BEGAN THE SIMPLE FACT IS

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.824
THIS WE PROJECTED THAT FORTY

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.292
FIVE AND 75% OVER NATIVE

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:45.660
SOMEONE AS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:47.662
EXTIRPATED THE NEXT FIFTY TWO

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.797
HUNDRED YEARS RESPECTIVELY. IF

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.498
PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE AND THE

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.434
FISH BIRDS ARE MAJOR REASON FOR

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.401
OBSERVE DECLINE THROUGHOUT THE

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.304
STATE. BUT AS THE LAST PORTENT-

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.572
THE LAST PART OF THIS RESULT

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.973
FROM SOS REPORT THAT IS KEY

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.575
QUOTE IF PRESENT TRENDS

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.377
CONTINUE TO BE CLEAR

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.912
EXHORTATION EXTINCTION OF

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.180
SOMEONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.349
NOT A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:08.149
AND THAT THIS COMMUTING

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:10.085
CALTRANS OF ENORMOUS AN AMAZING

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.353
OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.054
RESPONSIBILITY INFERNO THEM

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.656
YOUR JOB IS EASY PROVIDE ACCESS

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.091
TO STORE CALL HABITATS IN THE

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.326
FISH WILL RETURN. THIS WORK

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:21.262
HOWEVER CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:24.733
TIMES QUICKLY RUNNING OUT.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:25.333
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.067
JUST IF YOU QUESTIONS SO. TALK

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.535
TO US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES SO-

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.671
KNOW THAT CALTRANS HAS. BEEN

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.773
WORKING ON MAKING PROGRESS

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.974
THERE'S A LOT OUT THERE IN IN

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.442
CANDIDLY RIGHT THIS IS

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.378
HISTORICAL PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:37.245
HAPPENING ACROSS THE

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:40.148
GENERATIONS. SO TELL ME SOME OF

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.583
THE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES THAT

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.952
YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO GET UP TO

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:46.087
THOSE- HIS STORE COLD WEATHER.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.322
AT HABITAT IF YOU DON'T MIND

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.257
THE FISH THE FISH PASSAGE IS A

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.592
BIG ONE RIGHT SO I LEARNED

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:53.428
ACTUALLY FROM A DEAR FRIEND.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.296
TWENTY YEARS AGO TOM WHY SLOW

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.364
ABOUT FISH PASSES SUCCESS

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.466
STORIES IN THE NORTH COAST- AND

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:59.701
I HAVE THE VIDEOS AND WE TALKED

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.336
ABOUT IT EXTENSIVELY THE

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:02.704
CHRISTMAS DAY FLOOD FROM THE

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.372
SIXTIES RIGHT. LOT OF ROADS

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.540
BLOOD OUT WHAT CULVERTS WHEN

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.009
AND THAT PROVIDED ENORMOUS-

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.678
PROBLEMS FOR SOME ON IT- FISH

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.213
PASSAGE IS A HUGE DEAL THE

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.348
IMPORTANT THING THAT I WANTED

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.250
TO CONVEY. IS THE STATE OF THE

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:16.818
HABITAT IN MANY CASES ABOVE

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.486
THOSE BARRIERS IS IN EXCELLENT

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:19.988
CONDITION SO RATHER THAN

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.356
SPENDING MILLIONSAND MILLIONS

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:23.091
OF DOLLARS OF RESTORING KIND OF

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.793
DYSFUNCTIONAL HABITAT. IT

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:26.728
REALLY HAS A VERY SORDID.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.897
HISTORY RIGHT IT IS TO IF THEY

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.398
CAN SUPPORT FISH IT'S MUCH

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:33.501
EASIER I HINK TO RESTORE.

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.236
ACCESS TO HABITATS THAT ALREADY

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:36.938
EXIST. AND THAT HELPS AT ALL

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.573
YEAH IN A ARE YOU DO YOU HAVE A

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.241
LENS ON MORE OF NORTHERN

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.210
CALIFORNIA FOR THIS IN THE

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:43.044
NORTH COAST IN PARTICULAR

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.747
WHERE- IN IT IS WHEN I GET

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:49.083
WHERE. YOUR EYES ARE ON THIS IS

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.952
THAT. MENDOCINO HUMBLE DOWN

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.921
NORTH. NOT SO MUCH SONOMA

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.556
COUNTY HI CAN YOU GENERALLY

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:56.925
TALK ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE A IS

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:57.659
SPECIALLY ON THE NORTH COAST IF

01:24:57.725 --> 01:25:00.261
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MENDOCINO IN-

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:02.597
IN HUMBLE IN DOWN OR- THAT A

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.866
LOT OF FOLKS. PRISTINE HABITAT

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.134
PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD YEAH

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:07.669
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU HIT

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.204
THE MAIN POINTS RIGHT THERE

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.139
MOST OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:11.940
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IS

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.808
SOMEONE TO SUPPORT OLD. COVERED

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:14.676
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:15.610
ARE A FEW FOR YOU KNOW IN

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:16.478
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:19.113
COMPARATIVELY SO. MENDOCINO

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:25.487
HUMBOLDT THOSE. ARE HUGE AREAS

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:29.858
WHERE THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE. THE

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:30.859
HABITAT AGAIN IS RELATIVELY

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:31.759
PRISTINE THERE ARE ISSUES OF

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:32.360
COURSE WITH WATER TROLLS AND

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:33.261
WHATNOT- ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS BUT

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.362
THE KEY IS THE HABITAT IS THERE

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.530
AND IS VERY GOOD CONDITION. NOT

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:36.264
SEEN SOME OF THAT HABITAT I'VE

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:36.865
BEEN OUT THERE ON ON TOWARDS

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.533
WITH FOLKS AND CAL TROUT WITH

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.335
UC DAVIS AND OTHERS SO. YEAH IN

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:41.169
A CAN YOU ARE ALSO TALK ABOUT

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:43.171
HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AS

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:46.608
EXASPERATED THIS PROBLEM- AND-

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.376
OBVIOUSLY WERE. SOME OF THE

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:49.978
PREVIOUS REPORTS WE'VE HEARD IN

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.479
COMMITTEES SPECIALLY. ON THE

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.448
SACRAMENTO. BUT THAT IS ONE OF

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:55.149
THE MOST THREATENED RIVERS

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.084
RIGHT ESPECIALLY WITH

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:58.686
TEMPERATURES BUT- CAN YOU JUST

01:25:58.753 --> 01:25:59.287
TALK ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:01.689
HAS EXASPERATED ISSUE. SO TO IT

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:03.491
THERE ARE MANY FACTS RELATED TO

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:05.360
SOME ON AS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:07.362
THE BIG ONE OF COURSE IS-

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:08.296
GENERAL PROJECTIONS IS AN

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:09.597
INCREASE IN WATER TEMPERATURE

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.466
THAT ROAD ALREADY SEEING AND

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.767
PERCENT MORE PRECIPITATION

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.602
FALLING AS RAIN LOSSES NOW AND

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.471
HAVING THAT PERIOD- FROM THE

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:17.639
SPRING TO THE FALL THAT THAT

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.973
BASEBALL PERIOD REALLY

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.608
EXPANDING RIGHT. THAT'S AT OVER

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.877
SUMMER PERIOD AND SO OPENING UP

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:24.312
PASSAGE TO THESE PRISTINE

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:25.713
HEADWATERS IN MANY CASES AND

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.949
SPRINGS ALLOWS FISH TO OVER

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.885
SUMMER IN COLD WATER- THERE'S

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:31.886
AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.588
RECENTLY ABOUT A FISH CALLED

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:35.123
THE SAWFISH. IN THE IN THE

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.925
GREAT BARRIER REEF AND

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:39.427
SCIENTISTS HAVE SEEN HOW IT IS

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:40.795
BEEN ABLE TO MIGRATE TO

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.764
DIFFERENT WATERS. TO

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.098
ESSENTIALLY DEAL WITH THE

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.233
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.102
REALLY INTERESTING- SOME MONADS

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.737
FOR THEIR- INLAND PART OF THEIR

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:50.872
OR THEIR RESIDENT PART OF YOUR

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.106
LIFE HISTORY DON'T HAVE THAT

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.675
OPPORTUNITY THEY REALLY CAN'T

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:54.842
GO ANYWHERE RIGHT THERE IN

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:57.712
STREAMS- AND SO OPENING THAT

01:26:57.779 --> 01:26:58.780
HABITAT UP THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:02.150
OFF FOR. IN SOME CASES SIXTY TO

01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:03.985
SEVENTY YEARS WOULD BE VERY

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:06.054
GOOD FOR THE FAST BECAUSE IT BE

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:06.854
ABLE ACCESS THAT COLD WATER

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.389
DURING SUMMER AND THAT'S WHEN

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:11.559
THEY NEED IT. SOMEONE IS ARE

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:15.930
THE MOST. INSENSITIVE SPECIES

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:16.898
TO WARM WATER RIGHT FROM FOR

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.132
NATIVE FISHES IN CALIFORNIA-

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:19.367
AND SO THEY REALLY NEED THAT

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.269
COLD WATER IN THE CONCERN IS.

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.904
THAT THEY IN SOME CASES ALREADY

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.105
SEEING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.239
THAT THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:26.541
OPENING UP FISH PASSAGE

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:27.976
BARRIERS TO THOSE HABITATS WILL

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.278
ALLOW THEM. TO REALLY DO WELL

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:32.680
DURING SUMMER PERIOD. IN YOUR-

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.682
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:37.418
SPECIFIC NUMBER OR MORE OF THAT.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:40.688
KIND OF A ROUGH ESTIMATE- ARE

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.557
WE LOOKING AT. AGAIN ROUGH

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:45.727
ESTIMATE. HALF OF STREAMS FOR

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:46.828
IT WITH THEIR I. IN THE NORTH

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:50.531
COAST. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.099
HAVE SOME TYPE THE BARRIERS

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.968
BASED OFF OF. HISTORICAL

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.237
HIGHWAY PROJECTS WHAT ARE WE

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:58.006
LOOKING AS FAR AS PERCENTAGE

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:01.376
THAT MAY BE OUT THERE. YEAH I

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.377
I'M NOT SURE I COULD TELL USE

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.846
IN AN EXACT PERCENTAGE TO BE

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.314
HONEST ON ROADS IN CULVERTS AND

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.716
KIND OF HOW MUCH HABITAT IS CUT

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.518
OFF BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY.

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.287
HUNDREDS IF NOT A THOUSAND

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:15.757
MILES OF FISH HABITAT- AND

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:18.126
AGAIN. IT I WANT TO REFLECT

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:18.960
BACK ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.862
QUESTION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT-

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:21.963
COLD WATER BUT IT'S ALSO

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.464
PROVIDING THE FISH WITH WHAT

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:24.932
THEY NEED FOR THEIR LIFE CYCLE

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:26.534
FOR THEIR LIFE HISTORY. GETTING

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:27.368
TO THE HABITATS WERE

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.370
HISTORICALLY THEY SPAWNED IN A

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:30.004
REAR DOES ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.206
OF THAT. I THINK THAT WE'RE

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:33.741
LOOKING IT OVER A AND I KNOW

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.176
CALTRANS WILL GO INTO THIS BUT

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.911
I THINK I TOTAL INVENTORY OF

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.713
APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.581
ACROSS THE STATE. FIVE HUNDRED

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.582
AND THIRTY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:42.450
COMPLETED OVER THE LAST MANY

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:45.119
YEARS- BUT REALLY. THERE'S SOME

01:28:45.186 --> 01:28:46.487
KEY PROJECTS THAT COULD BE

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.523
ADVANCED AT THAT WOULD HAVE

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.191
SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT OF

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.526
THE SPECIES- WITH A

01:28:51.592 --> 01:28:53.828
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. DR ANY

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.229
OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO

01:28:55.296 --> 01:28:56.497
BE A TO MENTION BEFORE WE MOVE

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.432
ON TO SOMETHING I'VE JUST SAID

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:58.599
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:00.568
KIND OF THE PRIORITIZATION AND

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:01.869
THE IN THE BROADER TIMELINES ON

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.671
THIS AND HOW IT'S BEEN GOING- I

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:04.872
KNOW THAT. I APPRECIATE

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:07.008
CALTRANS WORK- AND I KNOW THEY

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.609
ARE VERY BUSY KEEPING THE ROADS

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:11.079
INTACT RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:11.646
STATE AND SO THEY HAVE OTHER

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.881
THINGS BUT- THE BIG THING HERE

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.616
IS. IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS IT

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:16.684
HAS TO HAPPEN SOON BECAUSE

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.152
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME LEFT

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:19.554
RIGHT AND SO IF FOR SITTING

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.656
AROUND. AND NOT GETTING IT DONE

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:22.757
THAT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.292
ISSUE FOR SO ON ITS IN THE

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:25.193
FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:26.494

IMPLEMENT REALLY A-

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.481
BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:49.250
PROJECTS BASED OFF OF- FISH

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:51.319
PASSAGE. AND TAKING DOWN

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:53.121

SOME POTENTIAL OPTIONS. AT THAT

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:22.416
COULD BE DEPLOYED- WITHIN THE

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:23.851
STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. FOR SHORE

YOU MY POWER POINT IS A

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.491
WHIRLWIND IT'S BASICALLY A

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.693
CELEBRATION OF PROJECTS THAT

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.264
HAVE BEEN DONE SINCE SB EIGHT

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:36.864
FIFTY SEVEN PASSED. YOU SHOULD

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:40.201
JUST BE ABLE TO HIT. START FROM

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.169
FOR FROM BEGINNING. AND IT'S

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:42.470
ALSO TRYING TO BE FIVE MINUTES

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:43.104
AND THIRTY SECONDS LONG SO GOOD

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:48.309
MAN. SO GO BACK TO THE POWER

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:48.910
POINT ITSELF INTO UP ABOVE IT

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:58.386
SHOULD SAY START. LYTRO. WE CAN

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:58.986
EITHER WING IT OR WE CAN MAKE

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:01.422
IT WORK ONE OR THE OTHER. SO

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:03.057
BASICALLY IF I CAN ON THE FIVE

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.526
COUNTIES. REPRESENTS THE

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.094
NORTHWEST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.896
IN WHICH HAVE APPROXIMATELY

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:23.044
FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF ROADS.

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:25.479
THE FIGHT CAN IS PROGRAM

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.914
STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:27.548
SEVEN WITH A LISTING OF THE CO

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.350
WHO IS A FEDERAL AND ENDANGERED

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:31.452
SPECIES ARE THREATENED SPECIES.

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:32.453
AND THE ISSUE FOR THE COUNTIES

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.522
WAS REALLY SIMPLE THE NORTHERN

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:35.156
SPOTTED ALLAH BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:37.225
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTION.

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.227
SO THE COUNTIES DIDN'T WANT TO

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:41.462
FACE THE PROBLEMS A NOT

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:43.130
ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE WITH

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.932
SOMEONE AND SO THE FIRST THING

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.467
THEY DID. IS THEY ASSEMBLED OUR

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:50.638
PROGRAM THE- THE AGREED TO

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:53.207
ELIMINATE POLITICAL BOUNDARIES

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.343
FOR DECISION MAKING AROUND

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:55.943
SALMON CONSERVATION AND THEY

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:56.744
FOCUSED ON WATERSHED

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:59.313
BOUNDARIES- THE PROGRAM IS

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.315
PARALLEL TO CALTRANS IF YOU

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.117
WILL IT'S COUNTY ROADS IT'S

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.252
FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF ROADS.

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:05.152
THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.687
COMPLETE THEM MIGRATION BERRIER

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.990
INVENTORY WE IDENTIFIED THREE

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.958
HUNDRED BARRIERS ON COUNTY ROAD

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:11.392
SYSTEMS AS WELL AS A

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.593
SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT SOURCE

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.263
PROGRAM. IN THE KILLINGS BEGIN

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:17.365
IMPLEMENTING- PROJECTS AS SOON

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:17.965
AS THEY DID THE THREE HUNDRED

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:20.401
BARRIERS THE- THE REALIZE IT

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.602
WAS BIGGER THAN THEY CAN TACKLE

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.004
SO THEY CREATED A BIOLOGICAL

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:27.508
PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. TO

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:28.075
FOCUS WHICH PROJECT WOULD BE

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.978
DONE FIRST. ZOOMING VERY

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.113
QUICKLY FORWARD TO TWO THOUSAND

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:32.847
AND NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:33.614
BEARS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AT

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:34.749
TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR

01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:37.118
ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:38.286
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MILE OF

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:39.987
RESTORED HABITAT WHICH IS VERY

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.722
CHEAP. BUT THE PROGRAM ALSO

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:44.458
SERVES AS A PEARL TO CALTRANS

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:47.161
AND SO ON. BY THE YEAR TWO

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.830
THOUSAND. IT WAS APPARENT TO ME

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.966
THAT CALTRANS WAS MOVING VERY

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.368
VERY SLOWLY. IN FACT I'D SAY

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:57.705
NOT MOVING AT ALL. AROUND

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:00.508
MIGRATION BARRIER REMOVAL SO.

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.109
BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WE

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:03.644
BASICALLY HAD HEARD A SERIES OF

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.846
ARGUMENTS BY CALTRANS AS TO WHY

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.248
THEY COULD NOT MOVE FORWARD IN

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.750
THOSE VERY VERY BRIEFLY WERE.

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:10.918
THE EACH PROJECT HAD TO BE

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:12.687
INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED THAT THE

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:15.022
DESIGN PROCESS WAS VERY SLOW

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:19.160
AND VERY CUMBERSOME- AND THAT-

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.227
THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.829
SUFFICIENT FUNDING NINE AND

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:24.699
AGAIN THE SLIDES ARE MORE OF A

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:25.333
CELEBRATION OF THE PROJECT AS I

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.201
GO FORWARD BUT- THAT THAT

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.137
SIMPLY IS NOT. CORRECT THE FIVE

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.839
COUNTIES HAVE USE OFF THE SHELF

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:34.642
STRUCTURAL DESIGNS TO IMPLEMENT

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:36.310
SEVENTY THREE PROJECTS. THOSE

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:38.145
PROJECTS REPRESENT NINE HUNDRED

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.847
AND SEVENTY YEARS OF PASSAGE

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:42.149
SINCE- NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.985
WHEN THE FIRST ONE IS INSTALLED

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.119
TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. THE LAST

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:46.988
ONE STALLED LAST YEAR. THESE

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.489
ARE ALL PRODUCTS A RAPIDLY

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.523
AVAILABLE THROUGH

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:52.593
MANUFACTURERS- THEY'RE ALL

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.462
SPANS FROM TWENTY FOUR TO A

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:57.832
HUNDRED FORT. THE PRIMARY

01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:00.634
DELAYS I SEE WITH CALTRANS OR-

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.103
RELATED AROUND THEIR IABILITY

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.405
TO PUSH PROJECTS THROUGH. AND

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.439
THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THE

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:09.377
CASE. THE HOUSE OF THE CONTINUE

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:09.844
TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.846
ARGUMENTS THAT THEY HAD SINCE.

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:12.546
TWO THOUSAND. THEY HAVE

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.281
SUBSTANTIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.816
PRESENT WE HAVE THOSE SAME

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:17.752
COMMITTEES THE ISSUES THAT ARE

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.586
BEING DISCUSSED TODAY IN THOSE

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.588
COMMITTEES ARE NUANCES. OF THE

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.056
ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.024
THE PAST THEY'RE NOT

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:25.426
SIGNIFICANT- NEW AREAS OF

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.561
DEVELOPMENT AND I AND SO I'M

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.697
SOMEWHAT CONCERNED AS TO.

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:31.766
CONVINCING CALTRANS TO MOVE

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.635
FORWARD IN A MUCH RAPID MUCH

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:38.406
MORE RAPID PROCESS ON. 90% OF

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:39.607
THE FIVE COUNTIES PROGRAM

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.142
PROJECTS ARE FULL STREAM

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:44.345
SIMULATION 10% OR ADAPTATIONS I

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:46.714
BELIEVE THAT- OF THE FORTY

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:47.982
THREE PROJECTS CALTRANS IS DONE

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:51.752
SINCE THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF SB

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:52.386
EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN SIX HAVE BEEN

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.321
FULL STREAM SIMULATION. I GUESS

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:55.356
THE THING THAT I WOULD

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:58.192
RECOMMEND IS TO RECOGNIZE THIS

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.060
IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:01.262
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE. FROM THESE

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:04.965
STRUCTURES SPAN- SMALL STREAMS

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.700
TO MID SIZE STREAMS ALL OF

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.236
WHICH FALL WITHIN RELATIVELY

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:12.940
EASY ENGINEERING. DESIGNS. AND

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:15.643
IRONICALLY. WHEN AND I'M SORRY

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:16.210
WE PASSED THE SLIDE THAT I

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:18.179
WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE BUT- I

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:19.013
WOULD LIKE TO USE A COUPLE OF

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.915
CASE STUDIES RELATIVE TO OUR

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.516
PROGRAM AND TO CALTRANS AND

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.952
THAT IS- RYAN CREEK IN

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:26.487
MENDOCINO COUNTY IN TWO

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.722
THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE REMOVE THE

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:31.225
DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION BARRIER

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.159
WHICH WITH A FULL STREAM

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:34.628
SIMULATIONS STRUCTURE. AND THEN

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:36.597
THE HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE LIES

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:38.466
JUST UPSTREAM OF THAT BARRIER

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:41.302
WHICH WAS A PARTIAL BERRIER. AN

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:43.237
UPSTREAM OF THAT WAS A PRIVATE

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.573
ROOM BERRIER WE EMOVE THAT ONE

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:47.041
IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN.

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:51.045
THE CALTRANS PROGRAM IN TWO

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.646
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WAS ABLE

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:54.548
TO MODIFY THE HIGHWAY ONE A ONE

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.584
STRUCTURE WITH NOT A FULL

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.919
STREAM SIMULATION BUT RATHER.

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:02.223
TO CULVERTS THAT WERE JACKSON

01:36:02.289 --> 01:36:05.659
BOARD UNDERNEATH THE HIGHWAY SO.

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:06.827
THE THEY WERE NOT EVEN ABLE TO

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:07.661
ACHIEVE FULL STREAM SIMULATION

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:08.696
IN THE SAME WATERSHED UPSTREAM

01:36:08.762 --> 01:36:10.297
AND DOWNSTREAM THE PRIVATE AND

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.599
THE COUNTY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:13.367
THAT. BUT I RECOGNIZE THE

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.169
COMPLEXITIES OF HIGHWAY ONE A

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.071
ONE MAKES THAT MORE DIFFICULT.

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:20.341
BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:26.614
GOOD FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND FOR

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.817
CALTRANS TO TAKE A MORE.

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.118
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.586
EXAMINE HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.355
ACCOMPLISH SEVENTY THREE

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.289
PROJECTS THAT HAVE

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:36.991
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER COST FOR

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:39.326
THE SAME SIZE PREMIUMS IF YOU

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:42.263
WILL AS WELL CALTRANS FACES FOR

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:42.863
MOST OF THESE AND I WOULD SAY

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.798
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. THE

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:45.933
DECLINE THE CHANGING IN

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.002
CLIMATIC VARIATION IN AND ONE

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:49.236
OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.939
MORE SUBSTANTIALLY. IS THE

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:54.241
EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE AFFECTS ON

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.410
THESE WATERSHEDS THE AMOUNT OF

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.912
HABITAT AVAILABLE IS DECLINING

01:36:57.978 --> 01:36:59.613
EVEN AS WE RESTORE BECAUSE

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:00.648
WE'RE LOSING SO MUCH OF THAT

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:04.885
HABITAT. PARTICULARLY IN THE-

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:05.486
IN THE INTERIOR IS AND THAT IS

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:06.387
FIVE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS.

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:10.457
I WILL STOP THERE. YEAH IN IF

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:11.759
YOU DON'T MIND TALKING ABOUT

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:16.163
THAT BECAUSE THAT LOOK- YES A

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:18.799
652% OF LAKE COUNTY'S LAND

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:20.734
MASSES BURN SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:23.604
FIFTEEN RIGHT MASSIVE OVER- IN

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:26.640
THE CHICO PARADISE BUTTE COUNTY

01:37:26.707 --> 01:37:29.610
AREA. CINEMA COUNTY. YOU CAN'T

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.512
KEEP UP RIGHT AGNESE BARRIERS

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:35.115
EMPLOYED- WITH THE MASS OF THE

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:37.518
SIZES COMPANIES FIRES TO TALK

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:38.085
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:40.020
JUST START TOUCHING ON. THE

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.289
PROJECTED BURN RATE FOR THE

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:43.691
KLAMATH TRINITY AT THIS POINT

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:46.160
IS THE ENTIRE- WATER SHOULD BE

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:47.161
BURNED WITHIN A THIRTY YEAR

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:49.396
PERIOD AND THESE ARE NOT ON THE

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.531
LOW INTENSITY FIRES THAT WE'VE

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.333
BEEN SEEN IN THE PAST. THESE

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:53.634
TEND TO BE VERY HIGH INTENSITY

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.869
AND SO THE- THE ABOUT THE

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:57.471
AMOUNT OF HABITAT THAT'S BEING

01:37:57.538 --> 01:38:00.040
LOST THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.008
TO PROVIDE FUTURE FOR THE

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:03.210
SPECIES IS TO MOVE NOW. WE

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:05.279
LITERALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.647
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PEOPLE THAT

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.314
SIT ON THE VARIOUS ADVISORY

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:10.150
COMMITTEES TO CALTRANS OR- OR

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.219
THE THIRTY ENGINEER DESIGNS TO

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:12.953
COME UP WITH STANDARDIZED

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.489
DESIGNS THAT ALREADY EXIST. THE

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:18.826
ISSUE HERE IS. THAT THE

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:21.762
DECLINING HABITATS ARE THE

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.131
PRIMARY. DRIVER OR SHOULD BE

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.233
THE PRIMARY DRIVER NOW IN SB

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:26.834
EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND YOU'LL

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:27.635
HEAR CALTRANS SAY THIS

01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:29.436
REPETITIVELY. THEY CAN'T DO

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:31.138
FISH PASSAGE IN LOSS OF THE

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:32.740
TRANSPORTATION RELATED OF FACT

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.108
WELL IN FACT THE- THE STATE OF

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:35.342
WASHINGTON MADE THE SAME

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.343
ARGUMENT IN THE SUPREME COURT

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.112
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAID%

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.647
NO RELATIVE TO AT LEAST INDIAN

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:41.682
TRIBE. TREATY TREATY OBLIGATION

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.683
AREAS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.885
KLAMATH TRINITY. BUT I THINK

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.720
THAT THE ISSUES AROUND YES THEY

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:49.223
ARE NOT THAT DISSIMILAR TO THE

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.624
ISSUES AROUND THE TRIBAL

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.059
CONCERNS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:54.061
REFOCUSING CALTRANS TO MOVIES

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.163
PROJECTS FORWARD MUCH FASTER

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.833
AND. I WILL JUST SAY I DO

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.334
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:04.905
INHERENT. FOSSILS THERE THAT

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:05.539
NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED STE SHAKEN

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.573
UP IF YOU WILL BECAUSE TIME IS

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.943
OF THE ESSENCE. MANY OF THE SO

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.611
WE YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MANY

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.279
OF THESE. RURAL COUNTIES

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:16.917
RESOURCES ARE LIMITED RIGHT AND-

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.018
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:20.921
ACCOMPLISH THIS. THE VERY AND

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.791
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. THESE

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:24.892
GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE POOREST

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:26.727
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND YET

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.495
THEY HAVE COMPLETED THE MOST

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.397
BARRIER PROJECTS AND IN THE

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.965
STATE AND POSSIBLY IN THE

01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:33.367
COUNTRY. THEY'VE DONE IT

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:35.069
BECAUSE THEY'VE USED LITERALLY

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:37.104
OFF THE SHELF DESIGNS FROM

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:39.573
MANUFACTURERS FOR THE BULK OF

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.908
THEM THE VIEWS THE WIDE VARIETY

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:44.011
OF TECHNIQUES THERE ARE A

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.679
NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES AND IN

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:47.514
DESIGNS FOR THESE THINGS IS NOT

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:48.849
THAT DIFFICULT ONCE YOU'VE DONE

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:49.683
THE MODELING FOR THE FLOWS AND

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.819
SCOUR ANALYSIS THE FOOTINGS.

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:52.886
THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.655
FINDING FOR MANY OF THESE

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:56.490
CROSSINGS NOT ALL FOR MANY THIS

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:58.525
IS FINDING THE RIGHT PRODUCT TO

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:00.060
BE ABLE TO CONVEY EITHER FULL

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.595
PASSAGE WERE IN THE CASES WHERE

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:02.830
YOU CAN'T. AND I DO

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.832
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT WE

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:06.834
NEED TO OPEN THE CALTRANS AND

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.036
OTHERS HAVE USE THE ARGUMENT.

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:10.237
THE FULL SPAN FULL CONVEYANCE

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:13.040
STRUCTURES. ARE THE ONLY WAY TO

01:40:13.107 --> 01:40:14.274
GO AND SO THE DELAYS HAVE BEEN

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:16.577
IN TRYING TO GET THAT DONE AND

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:17.978
THAT HAS ACTUALLY CUT OFF

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.046
HABITAT FOR MORE THANTWO

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.248
DECADES IN MY OPINION. THAT

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:22.916
SHOULD BE OPENED UP AT LEAST

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.485
WITH A OF SMALLER STRUCTURES

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:25.419
WERE NECESSARY WE'RE PLAYING

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:27.121
TRIAGE. BUT THE COUNTIES OF

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:29.723
USES OFF THE SHELF DESIGNS THEY

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:32.559
HAVE USED TO ARM IN REPETITIVE

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:34.461
USE OF THE SAME TYPES OF DESIGN

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:35.562
SO THEY HAVE FOR THE CONSISTENT

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.264
ANALYSIS IN THIS ASSESSMENT OF

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:38.832
THE- EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO DO THE

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:42.669
WORK. THE TECHNIQUES THE TIME

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:47.307
LINES AND ALL OF THAT. THANK

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:47.941
YOU SO MUCH MISS FRANK HAS TO

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:48.809
RETURN IT OF FOR CLOSING

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:49.877
COMMENTS WERE PANEL HERE AFTER

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:51.912
WE HEAR FROM NO OPPENHEIM. AS

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:52.513
YOU ALL OF HER DISEASE I COULD

FISHERMEN. ARE IMPACTED

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.422
SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE LOSS OF

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:04.258
SALMON HABITAT. AND HE'S GOING

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:06.493
TO BE TALKING ABOUT RESOLVING

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.128
FISH PASSAGE CHALLENGES N

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:10.030
PARTICULAR. IN THE STATE OF

01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:12.199
WASHINGTON IN THEIR DESIRE. TO

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:16.470
BE ABLE TO GET PROJECTS MOVED

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:17.037
ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM

THIS MORNING- THANK YOU FOR

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:25.679
CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE SALMON.

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:26.780
HAVE THRIVED IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.382
MILLENNIA. THEY USED BOTH FRESH

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:31.051
AND SALT WATER HABITATS I THEIR

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:32.686
DIVERSE LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:33.921
HAVE ENABLED THEM TO SURVIVE

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:35.656
THE EVER CHANGING AND SOMETIMES

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.758
VIOLENT. NATURE OF OUR REGION

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:39.026
OFTEN PRONE TO EARTHQUAKES

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:41.395
DROUGHT MUD SLIDES WILDFIRES

FLOODS EVEN VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:44.965
BUT THESE FISH DON'T STAND A

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.433
CHANCE AGAINST THE RAVENOUS

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.234
THIRST OF CORPORATE

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.236
AGRIBUSINESS THE DAMMING OF

NEARLY EVERY RIVER IN THE STATE

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.406
OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT ISSUE

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.708
TODAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF

MICHAEL FISHER BORN IN

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.215
TIME IN FRESH WATER THEY

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.649
MIGRATE DOWNSTREAM HUNDREDS OF

MILES TO THE OCEAN WHERE THEY

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:05.819
RANGE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.040
THAT VIOLATION AND PREVENTS OUR

OVER REDUCTION THE STARTED FROM

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:10.991
UC DAVIS YES THANK YOU- I WILL

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:13.393
KEEP IT A QUICK I WANTED TO

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.829
JUST COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT-

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:18.365
KNOWN MENTIONED- DID THAT I

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.666
OFTEN ACTUALLY REFLECT ON AS

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:21.735
WELL AND THAT I THINK IS REALLY

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:24.638
IMPORTANT. SALMON SOMEONE IS IN

01:47:24.704 --> 01:47:26.439
GENERAL HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:27.941
FIFTY MILLION YEARS THEY HAVE

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.676
BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING THEY

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:30.944
HAVE BEEN THROUGH VOLCANIC

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.078
ERUPTIONS THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:32.846
EARTH CREEK QUAKES

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:34.714
DISCONNECTIONS FROM HABITAT

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:37.184
GLACIERS I MEAN YOU NAME IT.

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:43.256
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS PERSISTED.

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:43.957
IN THE WORLD THE REASON WHY

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:44.558
THEY COULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:50.664
THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE. AB

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:51.498
ATTACHED TO SUPPORT THEM RIGHT

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:52.499
AND ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.000
RIGHT NOW NOT JUST CALTRANS IS

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:54.568
ITS LARGE BARRIERS AS WELL-

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:55.135
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY

01:47:55.202 --> 01:47:56.102
CANNOT ACCESS THE REALLY GOOD

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:56.703
HABITAT THEY CANNOT COMPLETE

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:57.838
THEIR LIFE CYCLE THEY DON'T

01:47:57.904 --> 01:47:58.405
HAVE THAT COLD WATER DURING

01:47:58.471 --> 01:47:59.706
OVER SUFFERING- AND SO HE

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:00.907
TALKED ON THAT AND I JUST KIND

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:02.609
OF WANTED TO REITERATE I THINK

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:04.211
FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:06.880
WE KNOW AND THE THESE ANIMALS

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:08.648
ARE INCREDIBLY GOOD COLONIZERS

01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:11.585
POPULATIONS OF BLANKED OUT

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:12.118
POPULATIONS COME BACK THEY

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:14.688
CAN'T DO THAT IF. THEY ARE

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.089
GENETICALLY MARGINALIZED AND IF

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.457
THEY THEIR HABITAT IS A

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:15.380
THE BEST SOLUTION FOR EACH

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:18.083
SITE. AND SO WE DO THINK AS

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.451
OPPOSED TO MAYBE WHAT WE'VE

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:21.320
DONE PREVIOUSLY IT'S GOT OPEN

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:23.355
UP MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:25.090
FULL SPAN AND FEWER OF THE

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:27.893
PARTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT'S GOOD

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.229
FOR US- BOTH FROM A LONG TERM

02:09:30.295 --> 02:09:33.398
READ LES MAINTENANCE- ANY

02:09:33.465 --> 02:09:36.001
BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME.

02:09:36.068 --> 02:09:38.103
WE ALSO HOPE AS WE DEFINE THE

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:40.105
PROCESS AND HAVE SOME CERTAINTY

02:09:40.172 --> 02:09:42.274
WITH THE STANDARDIZED DESIGNS

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.543
WAY BE ABLE TO WORK WITH NAMES

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.478
AND- CALIFORNIA FISH AND

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:48.347
WILDLIFE AND GET PROGRAMMATIC

02:09:48.413 --> 02:09:51.650
PERMITS SIMILAR TO WHAT- MISTER

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:52.684
LANCASTER TALKED ABOUT THAT

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:55.020
THEY'RE DOING- THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:58.657
US TO REDUCE THE TIME IN THE

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:03.428
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS AS WELL.

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:03.896
TOO MANY ITEMS I'D BE

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:08.800
INTERESTED IN IS THAT. THAT TWO

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:09.668
YEARS THAT SQUISH YEARS THAT

02:10:09.735 --> 02:10:13.105
FIRM DO YOU BELIEVE- AS FAR AS

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:15.774
BEING ABLE TO CUT THE TIME LINE

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:16.308
OFF OF A APPROVAL PROJECT

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.911
WHAT'S YOUR GUT. IT'S GOT YEAH

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:21.480
HELLO SO- BUT THERE'S MULTIPLE

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:23.015
PLACES WE THINK WE CAN CUT SO

02:10:23.081 --> 02:10:24.449
IT'S THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:10:24.516 --> 02:10:25.918
PROCESS BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED

02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:27.853
TOGETHER UP FRONT SO WE GET

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.655
THESE PERMITS- AGREEMENTS UP

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.056
FRONT. WE KNOW WHAT WHAT

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.591
ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME WE'RE

02:10:32.658 --> 02:10:35.294
TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THE DESIGN

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.829
PROCESS IS REDUCED OVER TIME IN

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.399
DEVELOPING THE PLANS- IS LESS

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:41.767
AND THEN THE TIME IN

02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:43.869
CONSTRUCTION AND I'LL BE ABLE

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:45.070
TO SHOW A SLIDE FURTHER ON BUT

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:48.040
ONE OF THE SUCCESSES- WE'VE

02:10:48.106 --> 02:10:48.640
BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THE BRIDGE

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:51.210
IN IN. FROM THE TIME THE

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:52.311
FOUNDATIONS WERE DONE IN OUR

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:54.479
PILOT PROJECT AND IT TOOK SOME

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:55.247
TIME TO DO THE FOUNDATIONS BUT

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.382
ONCE WE GOT THE MAN. WE BUILT

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:59.618
THE BRIDGE IN TWENTY THREE DAYS.

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:01.286
THESE CLEARLY CAN GET IN AND

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:03.555
GET OUT BETWEEN THE SALMON RUNS

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:05.624
AND POTENTIALLY YOU COULD HAVE

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:06.158
A CONTRACTOR THAT COULD DO

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:09.027
MULTIPLE SITES. BETWEEN DURING

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:12.064
THE DRY SEASON AND REALLY TRY

02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:13.899
TO EXPEDITE THESE AND PACKAGE.

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:16.535
PROJECTS THAT- WE GET SEVERAL

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:19.304
PROJECTS DONE OLD HELPING US

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:19.905
WITH SCHEDULE AND REDUCING OUR

02:11:19.972 --> 02:11:24.276
COSTS. SO I'M GONNA LOOK AT-

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:26.378
I'M JUST GOING TO USE AN

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:29.314
EXAMPLE HERE SO I'M LOOKING AT-

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:31.283
CEDAR CREEK. I THINK THAT WAS

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:34.152
THE BE DIRECTORS FOR SLIDE A

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:39.958
NINETEEN. SO. WOULD YOU THINK

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:42.527
THIS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF.

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:46.331
THE CANDIDATE FOR PRE FAB. THE

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:47.032
SUCH A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:48.367
CHALLENGE WE WILL WITH A

02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:50.269
PARTIAL SOLUTION HERE'S A GOOD

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:54.606
PARTIAL- SOLUTION- EVERY.

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:55.841
SURGEON JENNER YOU THINK YOU

02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:58.277
CAN DO ANYTHING BUT- THIS ONE

02:11:58.343 --> 02:11:59.378
COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:00.812
CHALLENGE AND I THINK THE FISH

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:02.981
PACKED DID DECIDE THAT THE

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:05.050
PARTIAL SOLUTION AT THIS POINT

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:07.052
WAS THE BEST SOLUTION WE AND IS

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:08.353
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN THE SHOW

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.988
ME EXAMPLE DISCUSS IS IT THE

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:11.390
NEXT FLIGHT TO SHOW ME AN

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:12.658
EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU THINK WE'LL

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:14.059
CERTAINLY HERE. OKAY SO THIS

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:15.594
WOULD BE A PRE THAT GUY

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:16.795
ABSOLUTELY SO HERE WE ARE WE

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:19.398
HAVE A CLEAR BARRIER- SPANNING

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:22.100
OVER THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE NOT

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.402
TLKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:26.171
THE CULVERT OR SOMETHING IS

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:26.872
FIFTY SIXTY FEET THAT'S WHERE

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:28.507
WE HAVE OUR CHALLENGES WHERE

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:29.341
IT'S NOT VERY ECONOMIC OKAY

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:32.110
CULVERTS BURIED DEEP BELOW THE

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:37.816
ROADWAY ELEVATION. BUT A

02:12:37.883 --> 02:12:38.317
LOCATION LIKE THIS VERY

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:42.254
CONDUCIVE OKAY. AND I

02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:43.288
APPRECIATE IT HAS ALWAYS TO

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:44.156
THESE FOR ME SEEN THE VISUAL

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:45.791
WHAT. WHAT IS BECOME FOR SO ONE

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:46.758
OF THE QUESTION THE ONE A FALSE

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:47.392
I HAVE IN A SCENE THAT YOU NEED

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:49.194
TO BE ABLE TO. LOOK AT THIS IS

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:49.961
I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER HAS

02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:50.929
SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THOSE ARE

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:52.397
CALLED THE SIXTY EIGHT. LOW

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:53.632
HANGING FRUIT PROJECTS WHAT

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:56.168
PERCENT. EVEN COULD BE.

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.503
ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE PRE FAB

02:12:58.570 --> 02:12:59.304
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:02.474
REALLY IMPORTANT- IT IS A SITE

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.675
THAT YOU GO OUT AGAIN MAKING

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:06.144
THIS UP AT THIS POINT RIGHT- IS

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:07.779
THE FACT THAT YOU GO OUT AND

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.348
SAY TO. YOU PUT SOMETHING OUT

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:14.119
TO BED OF. WE DO. AGAIN MAKING

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:17.356
IT UP. TEN CREEKS. I UNDER ONE

02:13:17.422 --> 02:13:17.956
CONTRACTOR WITH THESE HAVE TO

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.825
BE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS- SO IF

02:13:19.891 --> 02:13:21.093
YOU'RE LOKING AT. TEN

02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:22.894
DIFFERENT CROSS SCENES. IN

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:25.063
HUMBLE COUNTY THAT YOU KNOW.

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:26.231
PRE FAB COULD WORK WITH

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:28.533
HYPOTHETICAL. YOU DO THAT ON

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.768
ONE CONTRACT COULD YOU TO BE TO

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:32.170
EXPEDITE THIS OR DOES IT HAVE

02:13:32.237 --> 02:13:33.805
TO BE INDIVIDUAL. MY LAST

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:35.607
QUESTION AND I PROMISE I'LL

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:36.975
TURN HEARTLESS BAILEY'S ON THE

02:13:37.042 --> 02:13:39.945
PROGRAM ATTIC SIDE. TALK ME

02:13:40.011 --> 02:13:42.114
THROUGH. TIMELINE TO BE A

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.549
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:45.117
BEFORE WE START ENGAGING THE

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:47.018
RESOURCE AGENCIES. SO

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:50.088
CONTRACTING THESE PROJECTS TO

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:53.058
DO MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME.

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.025
SURE CENTER I THINK WHEN YOU

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:54.559
LOOK AT FROM A CONTRACTING

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:56.161
PERSPECTIVE IN AND AS LONG AS

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:57.729
WE HAVE A FIX IT FIRST NEXUS I

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.498
THINK. PULLING PROJECTS

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:01.199
TOGETHER MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:02.167
I THINK THERE'S AN ECONOMY OF

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:03.935
SCALE OF DOING A DEPENDING ON

02:14:04.002 --> 02:14:05.437
LOCATION USUALLY HAVE TO HAVE

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:06.571
LOCATIONS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE

02:14:06.638 --> 02:14:07.839
TOGETHER FOR THE CONTRACTOR

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:09.207
WHEN THEY MOBILIZING GO OUT AND

02:14:09.274 --> 02:14:10.375
DO THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:12.144
SO. THAT ALL FACTORS IN TWO

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.112
LOCATIONS IN SOME OF THE SIXTY

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:15.714
EIGHT SPAN ALL IN UP ALL OF LL

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:16.681
THE WAY UP AND DOWN THAT THE

02:14:16.748 --> 02:14:18.350
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO AS NOT

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:20.318
ALWAYS CONDUCIVE TO DOING THAT

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:21.720
BUT BUT CERTAINLY- AND LOOKING

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:25.023
AT OTHER. METHODOLOGIES ARE CMG

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:26.324
SEE YOUR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:28.660
GENERAL CONTRACTOR. IS IT AN

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:30.328
ALTERNATE PROCUREMENT THAT WE

02:14:30.395 --> 02:14:30.996
CAN USE GETTING THE CONTRACT ON

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:33.298
BOARD TO FIGURE OUT- HOW DO WE

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:36.668
MORE EFFICIENTLY CONSTRUCT-

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:38.036
THESE THINGS. ARE THE DISEASE'S

02:14:38.103 --> 02:14:39.738
THESE BRIDGES- BEING IN

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:41.440
CONSULTATION WITH OUR RESOURCE

02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:43.775
PARTNERS OUT THERE I THINK THAT

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.243
GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY THERE

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:47.279
AS WELL. AND IT. REALLY AT TO

02:14:47.345 --> 02:14:48.079
TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:49.681
REGARDING THE PROGRAMMATIC-

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:50.582
WE'VE ALEADY KICKED OF

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:52.350
DIALOGUES WITH THE NATIONAL

02:14:52.417 --> 02:14:54.186
FISHERIES SERVICE AS WELL AS

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:55.287
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.355
AND WILDLIFE AVERAGING ONE. ON

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.090
PROGRAMMATIC- AND IT HELPED

02:14:59.157 --> 02:15:01.293
INFORM THE EFFORTS THAT WERE TO

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:03.061
UNDER GOING WITH- ENGINEERING

02:15:03.128 --> 02:15:06.097
SERVICES ON- THE STANDARD

02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:08.667
DESIGN SOLUTIONS AND THEN- AN

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.569
ASSOCIATE IT AND PYLE STRIKE

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:12.370
ANALYSIS SO THAT WE CAN

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:14.573
UNDERSTAND. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:16.942
TYPES OF SUBSTRATES AND WHAT

02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:18.977
KIND OF FOUNDATIONS- WOULD BE

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.946
NEEDED AND THE ASSOCIATED AND

02:15:21.012 --> 02:15:23.315
STRIKES FOR PILES. THAT ALL OF

02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:25.283
THAT HELPS US DESCRIBE THE

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:27.152
ACTION IN THE CONSULTATIONS

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:29.488
WITH THE RESOURCE AGENCIES SO

02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:31.323
THAT WE CAN HAVE A THAT

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:33.158
STANDARD APPROACH AND THEN THEY

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:36.161
ARE ABLE TO. PERMIT OUR OR

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.162

PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL. SAID AT THE

02:15:41.733 --> 02:15:44.135
TIME LINE ON THAT IS AND KNOWN

02:15:44.202 --> 02:15:45.971
UNTIL WE CAN PRESENT THE

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:48.006
INFORMATION WITH THE STANDARD

02:15:48.073 --> 02:15:53.845
DESIGNS BEING COMPLETED AND.

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:54.412
THAT PILE STRIKE ANALYSIS I

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:59.584
MENTIONED. ARE YOU LOOKING ATTY.

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:00.519

COMMIT THE AGENCIES TO I'M NOT

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:08.159
LOOKING FOR AN ITEM THAT I WAS

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:08.760
TRYING TO BE HOPEFUL THAT WE

02:16:08.827 --> 02:16:09.394
CAN COMPLETE IT WITHIN THE NEXT

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:11.663
TWO YEARS OKAY. YEAH I'M IN MY

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:12.964
LAST QUESTION BEFORE TURN OVER

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:15.433
YOU AYE AYE LATER THEIR AND I

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.067
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE AND THAT WAS

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:18.069
WILL LAST. TO WARMER TEMPS.

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:20.238
MISTER DEPUTY SAID ALL SIXTY

02:16:20.305 --> 02:16:21.573
EIGHT LOCATIONS BY IN THE YEAR

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.975
CAN YOU JUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.443
HOPE TO WRAP UP IN IS AT TWO

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.011
THOUSAND NINETEEN OR TWENTY

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:28.980
TWENTY. IT IS IN TWO THOUSAND

02:16:29.047 --> 02:16:30.181
NINETEEN SO WE HAVE SIXTY EIGHT

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:31.550
HIGH PRIORITY FISH PASTORS

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:33.285
BEARS HOME AND SO WHAT I'VE

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:34.953
ASKED MY MAIN IS TEAM TO GO

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.688
BACK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:38.290
A NEXUS WOULD FIX IT FIRST ON

02:16:38.356 --> 02:16:42.961
TEN OF. THE SIXTY EIGHT MMHM

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:45.730
BUT SOME OF THOSE. FIX THE

02:16:45.797 --> 02:16:46.364
FIRST INVESTIGATIONS HAVE NOT

02:16:46.431 --> 02:16:47.632
OCCURRED. OR IT'S BEEN A LONG

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:48.733
TIME SINCE THE LAST OCCURRED SO

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:49.834
THERE MAY BE DEGRADATION IN THE

02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:51.503
PIPE ITSELF THAT COULD LEAD TO

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:52.871
AN ACCESS FOR US GOING ON FIX

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:54.839
IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:16:54.906 --> 02:16:55.807
DO IS GO OUT AND GET THAT

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:58.076
NEXUS- TO SEE I WILL TELL YOU

02:16:58.143 --> 02:17:00.879
THAT FOURTEEN OUT OF THE SIXTY

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:02.080
EIGHT ARE ACTUALLY BRIDGES. AND

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:04.482
SO WE HAVE TO SOME MORE-

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.151
INVESTIGATION ON WHAT THE BEARS

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:09.154
ARE THAT IN SO WE ALREADY HAVE-

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.455
BRIDGES NOW WHETHER THERE'S

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:12.223
APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.358
STRING BAD OR- WHAT WHAT'S

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:15.160
CAUSING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. A

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.828
LITTLE MORE RESEARCH ON THAT.

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:18.129
WE JUST GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.564
AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND.

02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:22.601
ADDITIONAL CULVERTS- OR BRIDGES

02:17:22.667 --> 02:17:24.235
THAT WE NEED THAT THAT ARE IN

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:26.738
DISTRESS- OR AS SOME

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:27.906
DEGRADATION THAT WE GO JEAN

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.641
USED TO FIX THE FIRST MONEY TO

02:17:29.708 --> 02:17:30.475
GO OUT THERE AND FIX AND HAVE-

FABRICATED YOU CAN BRING IT OUT

02:28:25.129 --> 02:28:26.364
TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN THINK

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.132
OF IT LIKE AND I KEY A BRIDGE

ACTIVITY SINCE WE SEE A LOT OF

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.636
BENEFITS WITH THE- WITH THE

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.772
FULL SPAN SOLUTION. WHAT AREA-

02:29:07.838 --> 02:29:11.142
CORRECT YEAH I'VE NEVER

02:29:11.208 --> 02:29:11.742
PURCHASED ANYTHING FOR AT FROM

02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:12.310
IKEA THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:16.113
ASSEMBLE. SO WORSLEY OR SOME

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:18.749
REALLY GOOD CONTRACTORS WE WORK.

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:19.350
FACTS ARE CASH IS STILL IN THE

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:23.621
GARAGE. PRETTY WELL. SO THE

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:24.188
CALTRANS VERSION WHICH

02:29:24.255 --> 02:29:25.589
HOPEFULLY DRAW THIS

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:26.190
COLLABORATION WILL LEVEL WORK

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:29.160
VERY WELL SO. SO WE TALKED

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:31.295
EARLIER ITS ITS ITS MULTI

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.530
FACETED IN THE WAYS THAT WE CAN

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:35.333
REDUCE BOTH COST AND TIME FROM

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:36.867
THE- WITH WE THINK THROUGH THE

02:29:36.934 --> 02:29:38.336
COLLABORATION THE PROGRAMMATIC

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:39.570
ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS THE

02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:41.072
DESIGN PROCESS TO CONSTRUCTION

02:29:41.138 --> 02:29:43.040
PROCESS. AND REDUCING THE NEED

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:44.442
FOR MAINTENANCE ALL REDUCING

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:47.712
TIME ALL REDUCING- COST AND WE

02:29:47.778 --> 02:29:49.814
THINK WITH A BETTER IMPROVE

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.615
VARMINT ALLOW COME NOT ONLY FOR

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:54.018
THE- SALMON AND STEEL HEAD BUT

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:55.419
THESE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS ARE

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:57.521
OFTEN GOOD FOR OTHER SPECIES

02:29:57.588 --> 02:30:00.024
THAT ARE ABLE TO USE THE- THAT

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:04.862
IS A- CROSSING AREA. WE PREFER-

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.263
WHEN WE CAN THE FULL SPENCER

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.432
LUCIEN BUT WE HAVE- GUIDANCE

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:10.234
MATERIAL MANUALS ARE FOR

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:11.836
DIFFERENT HYDRAULIC SOLUTIONS

02:30:11.902 --> 02:30:13.137
THAT WE USE MANY F OUR PAST

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:14.939
SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE- THE

02:30:15.005 --> 02:30:17.541
PARTIAL HYDRAULIC SOLUTIONS- WE

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:19.143
ALSO USE STREAM SIMULATION

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:21.379
DESIGN STRATEGIES- WHEN IT'S

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:24.648
NOT FEASIBLE UT- WE ARE-

02:30:24.715 --> 02:30:26.450
DRIVING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.886
FULL SPAN WHERE IT APPEARS

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:32.723
THAT. THE. HAVING THAT TOOL

02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:33.891
AVAILABLE TO US WHERE IT'S

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:34.458
FEASIBLE AND IT'S THE BEST

02:30:34.525 --> 02:30:35.926
ALTERNATIVE AS WE SAID WE GO

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:37.128
THROUGH THIS COLLABORATIVE

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:41.265
STRATEGIZING- PROCESS CITY CAN

02:30:41.332 --> 02:30:42.199
YOU GO BACK TO THAT REAL QUICK

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:45.169
SO. IS THAT. YOUR EIGHT TO TEN

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:48.105
MILLION VERSUS. THIS IN MARIN

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:51.742
GIMME. IRAN IS THE EIGHT TO TEN

02:30:51.809 --> 02:30:53.844
MILLION DOLLAR TYPE PROJECT AND

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:54.645
IF YOU'RE DOING THE LATTER LIKE

02:30:54.712 --> 02:30:56.847
THAT ANY WHAT'S THAT- THERE'S A

02:30:56.914 --> 02:30:59.817
LOT MORE AS IT'S READ THE. THE

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:01.152
THREE MEN WONDER WONDER THREE

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:02.420
MILLION TYPE. OF THAT OKAY

02:31:02.486 --> 02:31:04.855
THAT'S- CHEAPER THAN THIS IS

02:31:04.922 --> 02:31:07.124
CHEAPER. BUT IT ALSO COMES OF

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.926
THE MAINTENANCE COSTS AND A

02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:11.061
LIFESPAN THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:13.197
THE BRIDGE ALTERNATIVE SO WE

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:14.165
MAY HAVE TO FIND OURSELVES

02:31:14.231 --> 02:31:16.133
GOING BACK IN CLEARING OUT-

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:18.202
DEBRIS IN THINGS IN THERE AND

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:19.170
THAT DEBRIS ITSELF CAN DAMAGE.

02:31:19.236 --> 02:31:21.739
THE ASSET. AND THEN IT'S NOT AS

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:23.007
EFFECTIVE AND THEN WE NEED TO

02:31:23.073 --> 02:31:24.909
GO BACK IN AND GET ANOTHER

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:25.976
PERMIT AND DO ANOTHER PROJECT

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:27.912
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN.

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.346
THE WORKING POOR WE'RE MOVE

02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:33.451
TILTING TOWARD THE FULL SPAN I

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:37.254
THINK WHEN WE CAN DO THOSE AND.

02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:38.355
AN EXAMPLE OF THE FORCE OF FULL

02:31:38.422 --> 02:31:39.356
SPAN IS THE FORD COUGH CREEK

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:40.758
BRIDGE THIS IS DONE A FEW YEARS

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:42.760
AGO BUT IT REALLY SET THE TONE

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.562
FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE

02:31:44.628 --> 02:31:49.166
FULL SPAN. IT'S UP AND SISKIYOU

02:31:49.233 --> 02:31:52.269
COUNTY ON ROUTE- NINETY SIX- WE

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:53.437
USED ALL PREFABRICATED

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:55.206
COMPONENTS YOU CAN SEE THE SORT

02:31:55.272 --> 02:31:57.208
OF ON THE LEFT THAT PART OF THE

02:31:57.274 --> 02:32:02.446
SLIDE THE ORIGINALS. SITE YOU

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:03.514
CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE SLIDE THE

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:06.083
PREFABRICATED- COMPONENTS BEING

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:08.886
ASSEMBLED- AND THEN THE FINAL

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:10.754
SOLUTION WAS A FULL SPEND

02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:14.492
SOLUTION UNATTRACTIVE BRIDGE-

02:32:14.558 --> 02:32:17.061
AND- AGAIN FROM THE TIME WE

02:32:17.127 --> 02:32:18.863
WERE COMPLETED THE FOUNDATIONS

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:20.331
TO WHEN THEY BEGAN THE WORK YOU

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:21.499
SEE IN THE CENTER WE WERE DOWN

02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:23.901
IN TWENTY THREE DAYS. NOW WE

02:32:23.968 --> 02:32:25.669
THINK ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THIS IS

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:26.670
A PILOT PROJECT WE WERE

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:29.206
LEARNING AS WE WEREGOING ON.

02:32:29.273 --> 02:32:30.774
BECAUSE OF ITS SUCCESS SO

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:31.742
THAT'S WERE RE DECIDED TO

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:33.310
INVEST IN THESE THESE ARE FULL

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:35.212
SPAN SOLUTIONS AND STANDARDIZE

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:37.047
THOSE WE THINK WE CAN DO BETTER

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:38.916
THIS IS THIS IS THE BEGINNING.

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.351
AND SO GOING FORWARD WE THINK

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:42.953
THERE IS THERE EVEN GREATER.

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:47.725
OPPORTUNITIES. SO JUST IN

02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:49.059
CONCLUSION WE THINK BETWEEN THE

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:53.764
ENVIRONMENTAL. PROBLEMATIC

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:54.665
APPROVALS THAT WE HOPE TO WORK

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:56.834
WITH OUR OUR- PERMITTING A

02:32:56.901 --> 02:32:58.235
RESOURCE AGENCY PARTNERS ON

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:01.305
WITH THIS UP AS A RESULT OF

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:03.207
STANDARDIZING- THESE TYPES OF

02:33:03.274 --> 02:33:06.043
DESIGNS AND REDUCING- THE

02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:08.512
TIMELINE IN DELIVERING THESE

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:09.947
PROJECTS WILL BE BENEFICIAL

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:12.316
AND- AND THEN THE COSTS

02:33:12.383 --> 02:33:13.984
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THE

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:15.719
TIME IN DESIGN TIME IN

02:33:15.786 --> 02:33:18.756
CONSTRUCTION AND THE- THE

02:33:18.822 --> 02:33:22.826
MAINTENANCE AND WE BELIEVE.

02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:23.394
THEY PREFERRED ENVIRONMENTAL

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.595
OUTCOME- NO NEED FOR ROCK

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:28.866
REVETMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:30.968
TOTAL FOR THE SIXTY EIGHT AGAIN

02:33:31.035 --> 02:33:31.535
IS. UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:37.608
MILLION. BALLPARK. DOES THE

02:33:37.675 --> 02:33:40.110
TOTAL OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THAT

02:33:40.177 --> 02:33:40.644
WE TALKED ABOUT THEY WERE

02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:44.014
ACTING TWENTY SEVEN BUT THEY'RE

02:33:44.081 --> 02:33:44.548
ACTIVELY WORKING ON IS TWO

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:45.115
HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:48.786
MILLION. SIXTY EIGHT WHAT WOULD

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:51.689
THAT RUN YOU HI ESTIMATE WOULD

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.023
YOU SAY LET'S JUST SAY TEN

02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:55.259
MILLION A PIECE O. SIX HUNDRED

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:57.428
EIGHTY MILLION. AND TO TALLY.

02:33:57.494 --> 02:33:59.363
SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE NINE

02:33:59.430 --> 02:34:01.065
NEXUS PROJECTS IN THE TOPS

02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:04.735
SIXTY OR SEVENTY. THAT'S WHERE

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:07.471
WE'RE LOOKING AT- MITIGATION OR

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:09.106
ADVANCED MEDICATION THAT- MISS

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:10.641
BAILEY TALKED ABOUT AND WE'RE

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:11.842
WORKING WITH A RESOURCE

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:13.410
PARTNERS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND

02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:15.412
THAT NEXUS- BECAUSE IF I CAN

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:17.314
FIND A TRANSPORTATION ACTORS

02:34:17.381 --> 02:34:18.048
FOR MITIGATION FOR ANOTHER

02:34:18.115 --> 02:34:20.117
PROJECT AND THAT GIVES ME THE-

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:22.586
THE A GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:25.022
AND USE THAT AND FIX AND REMOVE

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:26.223
THAT FISH PASSAGE BEAR ON THAT

02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:28.726
PARTICULAR PROJECT. IN USING

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:29.360
THAT MITIGATION TO MITIGATE FOR

02:34:29.426 --> 02:34:32.329
ANOTHER PROJECT. AND THAT'S

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:32.963
WERE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH WITH

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:35.532
OUR PARTNERS RIGHT NOW. SO WHEN

02:34:35.599 --> 02:34:37.868
YOU DO THE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:34:37.935 --> 02:34:38.469
SIXTY EIGHT BY THE END OF THE

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:41.405
YEAR YOU CAN  YOU THAT'S GOING

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:42.006
TO GIVE YOU YOUR INVENTORY OF

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:44.908
YOUR. CHAT YOUR REDIRECT NEXUS

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:49.079
FOR TRANSPORTATION. VERSES

02:34:49.146 --> 02:34:49.647
THOSE THE ART THAT'S CORRECT

02:34:49.713 --> 02:34:53.417
SIR OKAY. OKAY I WILL TELL YOU

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:55.119
THE OTHER THEY'RE STILL ANOTHER

02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:56.153
FIVE HUNDRED BARRIERS THAT IF

02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:57.421
WE'VE GOT A NEXUS ARE NOT THE

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:58.922
HIGH PRIORITY BUT THEY'RE STILL

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:01.158
BEARS THAT IF WE ARE WORKING ON

02:35:01.225 --> 02:35:03.394
A CULVERT OF THAT HAS A VERY WE

02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:05.562
NEED TO GO AHEAD AND FIX THAT

02:35:05.629 --> 02:35:06.163
AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:09.433
FOR THOSE AS WELL. STANDARD

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:12.770
THOUGHT OF COMPLETING ALL SIXTY

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:15.906
EIGHT IN HOW MANY DECADES. IF

02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:21.378
WE GO ALONG AS WE ARE NOW.

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:23.247
CURRENTLY WERE AVERAGING

02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:26.183
APPROXIMATELY FIVE A YEAR- SO A

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:34.191
LOT OF YEARS. ALL RIGHT. SO AT

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:34.792
WE GOTTA FIGURE AB AND I KNOW

02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:35.359
MISTER DAVIS YOU'RE TALKING

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:37.728
ABOUT. FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE AN

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:39.630
EXPEDITE RIGHT. WELL I THINK

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:41.198
ALSO PT IN OUR ASSET MANAGER

02:35:41.265 --> 02:35:43.033
PLANET AND JUST LIKE WE DO WITH

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.669
OTHER BRIDGES AND CULVERTS AND

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:47.705
PAVEMENT TO ADD THAT INTO THE

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:48.906
INVENTORY AND THEN WHEN YOU

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:49.973
START LOOKING AT THAT YOU DO

02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.675
DATA ANALYTICS ON IT YOU PUT AN

02:35:51.742 --> 02:35:54.411
R. G. I. US AND SEE WHERE

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:55.012
THERE'S OVERLAP I MEAN I JUST.

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:57.414
I THINK IT WILL. PUT IT AT THE

02:35:57.481 --> 02:35:59.049
MAIN LINE IN STREAMLINING. INTO

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:01.452
OUR SYSTEM- THINK WILL HELP

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:02.052
TREMENDOUSLY IN THIS AREA AND

02:36:02.119 --> 02:36:05.289
WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT.

02:36:05.355 --> 02:36:08.392
CAME SO I'M HAVE SOME FOLLOW

02:36:08.459 --> 02:36:10.627
UPS HERE THAT. I'D LIKE TO BE

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:13.630
ABLE TO GO THROUGH. SO ONE OF

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:16.266
THE ITEMS THE COMMITTEE'S GOING

02:36:16.333 --> 02:36:20.370
TO BE LOOKING FOR IS. NO IT'S

02:36:20.437 --> 02:36:22.306
STILL SQUISHY BUT RETURN WHAT

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:23.941
IS IT THAT WE'RE GONNA REDUCING

02:36:24.007 --> 02:36:25.509
THE TIME FRAME USING THE PRE

02:36:25.576 --> 02:36:29.913
FAB PROJECTS. NUMBER TWO. WHAT

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:32.216
IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SIXTY

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:32.750
EIGHT WE CAN DEPLOY PREFAB

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:38.021
PURSES NOT. NUMBER THREE WOULD

02:36:38.088 --> 02:36:39.656
LIKE THE IN NINE NINE OKAY HOLD

PROVIDER THIS IS TOP SIXTY

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:25.102

PERSPECTIVES WE MIGHT COME TO

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:35.191
DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. I WOULD

ITS LOST OUT OF THE- THE WATER

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:47.003
AND I APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS- AS

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:49.339
I SHOWED YOU SEVERAL MONTHS AGO

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:49.939

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:53.310
MOVING FORWARD THOSE EFFORTS

02:45:53.376 --> 02:45:56.446
CAN. BE USED TO ADDRESS THE

02:45:56.513 --> 02:45:57.180
ISSUE OF GEAR THAT GETS LOOSE

02:45:57.247 --> 02:45:59.482
AND SHOWS UP ON THE BEACH. AND

02:45:59.549 --> 02:46:01.518
YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE SO THIS

02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:03.119
THIS BLL WE RIGHT HERE THIS IS

02:46:03.186 --> 02:46:04.254
ONE OF THOUSANDS THAT I PICKED

02:46:04.321 --> 02:46:06.923
UP FROM- THE BEACHES OF MORAN.

02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:08.725
AND AS YOU KNOW I TOOK ONE OF

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:11.261
THESE MOVIES AND I ADDRESSED IT

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:14.531
WITH A WITH A WOOD RASP. AND I

02:46:14.597 --> 02:46:15.732
TURNED THAT BILLY. INTO A JAR

02:46:15.799 --> 02:46:18.835
OF POWDER. AND THIS IS WHAT

02:46:18.902 --> 02:46:20.170
HAPPENS TO THESE BOOTIES ON THE

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:21.938
ROPE AND THE CRAP. THE BAIT

02:46:22.005 --> 02:46:24.307
JARS. WHEN THEY GET PUSHED UP

02:46:24.374 --> 02:46:25.475
INTO THE ROCKS ALONG THE COAST

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:27.210
AND NO ONE PICKS THEM UP. THERE

02:46:27.277 --> 02:46:28.678
JUST TUMBLED LIKE A ROCK

02:46:28.745 --> 02:46:31.681
TUMBLER. AND IT JUST THIS IS.

02:46:31.748 --> 02:46:33.483
THE CRAB FISHERMEN NEED A

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:34.584
HEALTHY OCEAN AS WE HEARD

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:36.953
EARLIER. BUT CRAPPIE FISHING IS

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:37.954
HARD ON THE OCEAN ESPECIALLY

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:39.789
WHEN I WANT TO GEAR GETS LOOSE.

02:46:39.856 --> 02:46:42.459
AND LAST WEEK I SPOKE TO A

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.260
WOMAN FROM FROM DFW. AND I

02:46:44.327 --> 02:46:47.163
LEARNED IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S

02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:48.665
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:51.501
THOUSAND POTS. PERMITTED TO PUT

02:46:51.568 --> 02:46:53.169
IN THE WATER. THOSE AREN'T ALL

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:55.271
FINISHED. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE

02:46:55.338 --> 02:46:56.606
RANGING PAY FOR THE FISH AND

02:46:56.673 --> 02:46:58.641
THEN THEY DON'T. ABOUT A

02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:00.343
HUNDRED AND 400-002-0040 THREE

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:03.046
THOUSAND. POTS ARE FINISHED.

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:04.447
I'VE HEARD THAT ROUGHLY 10% OF

02:47:04.514 --> 02:47:06.683
THE GEAR GOES MISSING. SO

02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:09.919
THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND

02:47:09.986 --> 02:47:10.520
POTS THE THAT JUST GO MISSING

02:47:10.587 --> 02:47:17.527
IN. TURN INTO DEBRIS IN THE-

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.396
ALONG ALONG THE SHORES IN IN

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:19.996
THE OCEAN IN VERY QUICKLY WRAP

02:47:20.063 --> 02:47:23.032
UP. FISHERMEN WANT TO GET BACK

02:47:23.099 --> 02:47:24.801
TO DAYS OF LOOKING FORWARD TO

02:47:24.868 --> 02:47:26.269
THE OPENER AND I WANT TO POINT

02:47:26.336 --> 02:47:27.704
OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:29.973
POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA BACK

02:47:30.039 --> 02:47:30.573
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WAS ABOUT

02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:32.809
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S

02:47:32.876 --> 02:47:35.178
ABOUT FORTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW.

02:47:35.245 --> 02:47:38.415
THEN WE CAN'T. KEEP EXPECTING

02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:40.617
THEOCEAN TO DELIVER. WHAT IT

02:47:40.683 --> 02:47:43.153
HAS DELIVERED. WHEN WE JUST

02:47:43.219 --> 02:47:46.689
KEEP MULTIPLYING LIKE RABBITS.

02:47:46.756 --> 02:47:47.323
AND SO WE YOU KNOW BEACH WE CAN

02:47:47.390 --> 02:47:50.427
EXPECT. THE PLANET TO JUST KEEP

02:47:50.493 --> 02:47:51.961
ON DOING WHAT IT'S BEEN DOING

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:54.097
WHEN WE KEEP MAKING BIGGER

02:47:54.164 --> 02:47:55.532
BIGGER DEMANDS I THINK IT'S

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:59.002
INCUMBENT UPON US. TO FOR A

02:47:59.068 --> 02:48:00.170
LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:48:00.236 --> 02:48:02.138
BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S

02:48:02.205 --> 02:48:03.640
UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THE OCEAN

02:48:03.706 --> 02:48:05.942
IS JUST KEEP PROVIDING. WELL

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.911

SOME OF THE PICTURES- THAT WHAT

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.523
MACHINES IS PICKED UP. ALONG

02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:22.125
THE OCEAN IT'S IMPRESSIVE IN

02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:24.327

BE A TO KEEP THE SHORES CLEAN

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:30.467

THE BEACHES OUT MARIN I'VE

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:41.711
FOUND THAT THE EAST BAY

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:42.412
HOMELESS CAMPS. ARE A MAJOR

02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:44.848
SOURCE. OF DEBRIS INCLUDING

02:48:44.914 --> 02:48:46.249
MEDICAL WASTE IN THE FORM OF

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:48.418
DIRTY SYRINGES AND I'VE BEEN

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:49.452
I'VE MET A LOT OF MY CALTRANS

02:48:49.519 --> 02:48:52.155
ROLLED EXES GOT VERY BIG. I'VE

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:53.156
LEARNED IS THAT MANY MILLIONS

02:48:53.223 --> 02:48:55.525
OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT. CLEANING

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:58.228
UP REPEATEDLY CLEANING UP ALL

02:48:58.294 --> 02:48:58.828
ALONG THE HIGHWAYS AROUND THE

02:48:58.895 --> 02:49:02.465
STATE. AS THE HOMELESS PEOPLE

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:03.132
MOVE ACROSS THE ROAD WALL THEIR

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:03.733
BELONGINGS ARE THROWN AWAY OR

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:04.767
OR CLEANED UP AND THEN THEY

02:49:04.834 --> 02:49:05.735
JUST MOVE RIGHT BACK INTO A

02:49:05.802 --> 02:49:06.669
CLEAN UP PLACE THEY DO IT

02:49:06.736 --> 02:49:09.038
AGAIN. IF WE CAN FIND HOMES FOR

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:10.707
THOSE PEOPLE OR MEDICAL HELP

02:49:10.773 --> 02:49:12.408
FOR THOSE PEOPLE OR IN SOME

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.811
CASES JAILS FOR THOSE PEOPLE-

02:49:14.878 --> 02:49:16.713
WE COULD SAVE MANY MILLIONS OF

02:49:16.779 --> 02:49:18.748
DOLLARS. THAT COULD BE PUT

02:49:18.815 --> 02:49:20.617
TOWARDS FISH PASSAGE IN I KNOW

02:49:20.683 --> 02:49:21.217
IT'S PROBABLY A DROP IN THE

02:49:21.284 --> 02:49:23.386
BUCKET BUT EVERY DROP HELP SO I
