TWENTY BECAUSE HAVE THE LA -- AND FINANCE YOU JOIN US AT THE TABLE. WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. COLLEAGUES -- AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING AND LISTENING OUR EXPECTATION TODAY IS TO GET THROUGH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT'S OUR BIGGEST. FACTION OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AGENDA FULLY ANTICIPATE PERHAPS GOING LATE -- SENATOR TING AND I WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. A DINNER BREAK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME YET NOT A LONG. ONE LIKE MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES -- AND FOOD WILL BE BROUGHT IN HOSTED BY SENATOR SEIZING THE BREATH EXCUSE ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AND I FOR MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND STAFF. BUT AT SOME POINT FOR THE GENERAL AUDIENCE WILL BE TAKING A FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTE BREAK FOR DINNER -- SO WE CAN PLOW THROUGH -- SERVICES WITH THAT ISSUE SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE CHANGE GOOD AFTERNOON LA JOH. ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU -- COMBINES THREE SEPARATE PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR RELATED -- TO THE P. C. OVERSIGHT OVER UTILITY WILD FIRE MITIGATION MOSTLY IMPLEMENTATION OF SB -- NINE OH ONE FROM LAST YEAR. SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A TOTAL OF SIXTY FOUR ONGOING POSITIONS AT THE P. YOU SEE TO EMPLOYMENT VARIOUS ACTIVITIES RELATED SB NINE A ONE IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING WILDFIRE ADMITTED MITIGATION PLAN. REVIEW AT THE P. C. -- ALSO PROPOSED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME CONTRACTING FUNDING FOR A COUPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES -- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSPECTION OF I OWE YOU WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR TO DEVELOP WILDFIRE POLICY AT THE PC. INCLUDING A LONG TERM VISION FOR A RISK REDUCTION ESTABLISHING METRICS FOR ABOUT YOU ATION AND CLARIFYING VARIOUS REGULATIONS. SO THE SENATE APPROVED FUNDING FOR ALL OF THE POSITIONS FOR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF ON GOING AND AS WELL AS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING -- THE PC TO REPORT ON OUTCOMES AND OF THE CONTRACTS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THEIR CONTRACTS. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED FUNDING FOR THIRTY EIGHT OF THE POSITIONS AS TO YOUR LIMITED TERM AND THE REST OF THE MONGO IN. pBILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT STATE OVERSIGHT OF WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. SO THE DIFFERENCES ARE THE FUNDING LIMITED TERM VERSUS LONG GOING AND THE LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES WE DO RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE FUNDING -- WE DO THINK THAT MUCH OF THE WORKLOAD IS ONGOING AS WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO APPROVE AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE POSITIONS AND THE FUNDING. AS ONGOING -- WE THINK BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE -- FOR BUDGET BILL AND TRAILER BILL ARE REASONABLE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE THE COMMITTEE AS AS DISCUSSIONS PROGRESS APPRECIATE THAT GOOD AFTERNOON FINANCE. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE APPROVAL OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE SHORT TERM RESOURCES WHICH WE THINK ARE DEAR TO AFFECT IMMEDIATE NEEDS -- WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE RESOURCES ARE ON GOING IN NATURE WE ARE OF COURSE OPEN FOR CAUGHT WITH A CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATORS AND STAFF IN THE UPCOMING TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW BEST TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND REFINING OUR PRIORITIES. AND WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH EITHER APPROACH -- WITH THE COUNTY -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CONFIRMING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS INDEED COMFORTABLE. THANK YOU QUESTIONS -- A SKINNER FILED BY MISTER NELSON -- IN LOOKING AT THE ITEMS SORRY -- THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE [inaudible] THE DID THE GOVERNOR'S -- RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECOMMENDATION HAVE ALL OF THE POSITIONS ON GOING OR JUST SOME. SO I HAVE IS I CAN SPEAK TO THAT PROPOSAL SO ALL OF OUR POSITIONS ARE ON GOING ALL OKAY. AND THEN -- THE ASSEMBLY MADE SOME FOR LIMITED TERM OKAY BY [inaudible] AND I'M I'M NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO OPINE ABOUT WHICH SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE LIMITED TERM BUT IT SEEMED TO ME WHEN I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE DETAIL. THAT THE POSITIONS IN DAY PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE OF THE PC THAT. THE NATURE OF SOME OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS. IS. IS CLEARLY ON GOING [inaudible] AND AND THEIR ROLE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE BEING DONE IN A WAY THE PROTECT RATE PAYERS. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT LEAST THOSE POSITIONS IN THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SHOULD BE ON GOING -- AND I HAVE A LITTLE LESS -- DETAILER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OTHER POSITIONS SO I WON'T NECESSARILY OPINE ON THE BENEFITS ARE MERITS OF SHORT TERM OR ON GOING BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. THE THAT THE RULE -- THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION AND THE ROLE THAT WERE EXPECTING FOR THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE TO PLAY THAT THOSE SHOULD BE ON GOING CENTER NIELSEN. WHAT IS THE FORM OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE WILL THIS BE A LETTER TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET CMMITTEE OR? AND HOW FREQUENTLY WILL LIVE REPORTING BE TO THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR V. S. SENATE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IS THE IT WOULD BE REPORT. TO THE LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE BY MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. THAT'S IMPORTANT THE FORM OF THE COMMUNICATION. SO WE WILL HAVE COMMITTEES WERE AND WE CAN. HERE AND EXAMINE THE ISSUE. BUT WILL ALSO HAVE A DOCUMENT TWO IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SEE NONE WILL HOLD AN ITEM OPEN. I WOULD ASK THAT BOTH THE LA L. IN FINANCE. PRESENT THE FOLLOWING ISSUES ALL TOGETHER ON ISSUES. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWO PLEASE.

TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT FRIENDS FOR RIGHT AWAY PURCHASE FOR ADDITIONAL SAFETY INVESTMENTS ALONG. THE AS STATE ROUTE ONE FIFTY SIX RIGHT OF WAY THE GOVERNOR AND THE ASSEMBLY HAD NO TIME PROPOSAL ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU FINANCE. FOR THESE PROJECTS -- NONE OF THEM ARE IN OUR BUDGET AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACCESS THEM IS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S PROJECTS WASHER SELECTION PRIORITIZATION. PROCESS AND GIVEN THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE PROGRAMMED AND THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THOSE -- ANY OF THESE -- PROJECTSIF FUNDED HERE WOULD NECESSITATE TAKING AWAY FUNDING FOR OTHER PROJECTS AND THAT FUNDING HAS ALREADY ALREADY BEEN PROGRAM SO FOR THAT REASON. WE SUPPORT OUR CURRENT NAY REVISION PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. SINCE COMMENTS FROM THE DANCE. FOR THE NIELSEN. WELL IN THE LIGHT OF THE NORMAL PROCESS IT WOULD SEEM THAT THESE BUT NOT. RISE TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE COULD COULDN'T DATE AND YOUR NORMAL PROCEDURES AS YOU DO YOUR TRANSPORTATION PLANS SIMPLY FOR THE END TO THE NORMAL SCHEDULE THAT THEY WOULD -- WITHOUT SKIPPING TO THE FRONT ISN'T THAT. THE NORMAL WAY IT GOES THAT'S CORRECT THERE IS A PROCESS TO IT. TAX FOR INSPIRATION YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW BACKTRACK TO ISSUE TWENTY ONE ON PAGE. TWENTY FOUR ON CALIFORNIA SHORTLINE RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN LA -- PLEASE. THE SENATE APPROVED SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TRADE CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT FIND FOR INVESTMENTS IN SHORTLINE RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE RAIL PLAN. IN PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA SHORTLINE RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE ASSEMBLY HAD NO PROPOSAL ON THIS ITEM. FINANCE A HERE TO OUR THE PROJECT IS NOT IN OUR BUDGET FOR SIMILAR REASONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SENATOR -- MORLOCK. MADAME CHAIR. THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO GO THROUGH THE CDC THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IS THAT CORRECT. TWO THERE'S A SEPARATE OUT OF LET MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK TO THAT YES. SO -- SO WHAT THIS DOES IS NO THERE IS STILL THE PROJECT SELECTION -- PROCESS THROUGH THE CDC IN THIS CASE -- THERE'S ALSO THE TRADE KREIDER IMPROVEMENT FUND AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT RESTRICTIONS ON THAT PROCESS AS WELL. OKAY I GUESS I JUST HAVE ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION AND THAT IS. WE'VE BEEN DISCOURAGED FROM DOING BILLS. TO ENCOURAGE THE BUILDING OF A NEW ROAD. AND NOW WE'RE GETTING BIT OF BUDGET BILLS TO MODIFY OR IMPROVE ROADS. AND IT ALL SEEMS TO GO THROUGH THE CDC HOW DOES A LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATE POOR WORK WITH THE CDC THE CHANGE THE PROCESS OF WHAT SELECTED WHEN [inaudible] I'M. STEVE ALSO PART IN A FINANCE SO THE THE LEGISLATURE IS REPRESENTED ON THIS THE THE CDC'S BOARDS SO THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO BOARD MEMBERS ON THE BOARD THAT ARE PART. OF THE REPRESENTED IN GETS HERE THE CASE SO. THROUGH THAT AND THEN JUST THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS -- YOU KNOW THE THEY HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS REGULAR HEARINGS WHERE THEY ADOPT -- WHERE THEY ADOPT THE THE PROGRAMS AND A AND THE DIFFERENT OF FUNDING -- PROGRAM SO THROUGH BOTH OF THOSE THAT'S NORMALLY WHERE THE INPUT WOULD BE HEARD. BUT THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD REFER THESE BILLS THEN AS A RECOMMENDATION SIGNATURE PROCESS STEP COMING. THROUGH THIS DOOR GO THROUGH THAT ONE CORRECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER VERY WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS. LA -- SEAN MIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION IN THESE REVENUE BOND FINANCING. FROM THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTION FUND FOR CAPITAL UP LATE PROJECTS TO REPLACE C. H. B. AREA OFFICES. AND HEY WORD EL CENTRO IN SAN BERNADINO. BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE LEASE REVENUE BOND FINANCING FOR ALL THREE PROJECTS AND BOTH HOUSES ALSO PRE PAYS YOU GO FUNDING -- FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT FOR THE EL CENTRO AREA OFFICE REPLACEMENT. THE SENATE APPROVED A PAY AS YOU GO FUNDING FOR THE HAYWARD PROJECT AND THE ASSEMBLY PREPARES YOU GOT FUNDING FOR THE SAN BERNADINO PROJECT. SO -- DATE CONFERENCE ISSUES CASH FUNDING FOR SAN BERNADINO IN A WORD. THANK YOU FINANCE WILL MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS OUT FIRST -- WE BELIEVE THAT WE SEVENTY BOND FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND CURRENTLY STATEWIDE THERE OVER A HUNDRED PROJECTS THAT USE. THIS TYPE OF FINANCING. THE SECOND POINT IS WE BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF WE RELY ON CASH FINANCING THAT PUTS ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT IN THE SHORT TERM AND I KNOW WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND JUST A LITTLE BIT. BUT MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF THAT ACCOUNT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR ALL OF US. INTO THE THIRD POINT IS WE BELIEVE THAT USING WAYS REVENUE BOND FINANCING IS A WAY TO ENSURE THE SOLVENCY OF THAT ACCOUNT WHILE MAINTAINING THE NEED -- TO UPGRADE AND BUILT CHP FACILITIES. THANK YOU QUESTIONS ARMS RACE. YEAH JUST -- THERE'S IT SEEMS LIKE THE ISSUE IS A WORD ALL CENTER IN SAN MARINO AND THE SENATE SAYS NO SAMBAR DINO WHICH I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE -- IN THE ASSEMBLY OF COURSE -- SAYS NO HAYWARD SO. WHAT WHY ONE OR THE OTHER AND DOES WHAT IS THE SENATE HEY SAMMY DINO -- AND I GUESS WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY -- HATE HAYWARD I DON'T KNOW IF I UNDERSTAND I WALDRON [inaudible] ELIA. OUT OF FINANCE [inaudible] ADD OSTROSKY. WE'VE WE'VE ELECTED THESE PROJECTS AND WE THINK ALL THESE PROJECTS ARE NECESSARY COULD ANSWER. FINANCE -- SALLY WHO CAN BUILD PARTNER FINANCE I WOULD AGREE THERE THE TOP THREE PRIORITIES FOR CHP OFFICE REPLACEMENTS. SEVEN NINE ANSWER FOR YOU -- ESTIMATES. SO THE MORE LOT WHAT IS THE LIFE OF A LEASE BOND. TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIRTY ARE GENERALLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO WE'RE GONNA BE PAYING MAY BE. THE SAME AMOUNT IN INTEREST OVER THE LIFE OF THE OF THE BOND. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO NOTE THAT -- WITH LEASE WERE LEASE REVENUE BOND FINANCING IT HAS UP ON WE HAVE A LIFE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT WHEN CORRECTED -- FOR INFLATION THE COST OF THAT IS THIS LESS THAN THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF THOSE PAYMENTS -- AND YOU ALSO CONSIDER THAT -- PROJECTS ESCALATED ABOUT 5% A YEAR SO FOR EACH YEAR YOU'RE AVOIDING FINANCING THE PROJECT GETS BY PERCENT MORE EXPENSIVE TO CONSTRUCT SO THERE'S KIND OF A A MEDIUM POINT WHERE IT. IT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW TO NOT DELAY PROJECTS AND AND JUST GO AHEAD WITH FINANCING AS WE DO WITH SO MANY OF OUR OF OUR ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. SO EVERY THOUGHT ABOUTDOING A BLEND. OF SOME CASH IN SOME WAYS REVENUE YES YES WE HAVE PROPOSED THAT AND THAT THAT'S A SOLUTION THAT WOULD WORK QUITE WELL. AND HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEEL ABOUT THAT IDEA -- WE'RE IN. AS PART OF IT. OKAY WELL IF WE CAN'T DO IT THAT WAY THEN NOTE NO STATION FIRST HAMMER TO DO YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL I GOT US. BUT A BONE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ISSUE. TWENTY THREE CLEARLY WITH LOTS OF WORK TO DO THERE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT THANK YOU. ISSUE TWENTY FOUR ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCE ELIA. UNDER HIGHWAY PATROL. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED BY PUTTING A MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEFENSE SIXTEEN POSITIONS IN ASSOCIATED COSTS. TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB. TEN SIXTY FIVE THE SENATE APPROVED FOR POSITIONS AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR TWO YEARS. AND IN THE ASSEMBLY PER THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED SO IT'S A DIFFERENCE OF FIVE POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR THE ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCE THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ORDS ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS A KEY PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TWO YEAR TIME FRAME. AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE CHP TO FILL THE ROLE IN COMBATING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SENATOR NELSON. THESE POSITIONS TO BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OR HOW WILL THEY BE DESIGNATED. TO BE LOCATED. I'M AN ART DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE BILL ITSELF SAYS TO LOOK AT AREAS WHERE THE OF THE CRIME IS IS HIGHEST AND SO THIS PROPOSAL ENVISIONS THREE TASK FORCE. DEPLOYED IN DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THE RESULTS OF THAT THAT REVIEW SAYS AND THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. PROPERTY CRIME MOSTLY IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AFTER HERE. THE BILL SAYS WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT AND IN CERTAIN DETERMINE WHERE THAT THOSE WHERE THOSE TASK FORCES ARE DEPLOYED THE ONLY. PROPERTY BUT OTHER VIOLENT CRIMES AS WELL. THIS IS SPECIFIC TO ORGANIZED RETAIL RETAIL OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE END [inaudible] THE THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR WIZARDS WHO COME IN WITH THEIR COMPUTERS AND MASS CENTER ASSIST. RETAIL STORE IN. CRACK UP TO NINE HUNDRED AND THE WALK OUT THAT'S BASICALLY PROP FORTY SEVENTY ALL RIGHT. I THINK IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW WE ARE THIS ISN'T SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN IT'S JUST ADDRESSING THE BROADER ISSUE OF RETAIL THEFT. WELL IT WOULD BE IT CERTAINLY WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSITION SO. I WOULD HOPE WE DON'T DISTRIBUTE ABOUT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THE HEIGHT OF THE ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN. MOVING ON WE'VE GOT A BLUE PAPER ON DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. ISSUE TWENTY FIVE I KNOW BOTH COMMITTEES A PAD -- PRETTY EXHAUSTIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THIS ISSUE. LAW AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE LA YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR FRIEND THANK YOU. RIGHT I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- AS THE CHAIRMAN JIM TO DO HAVE A HANDOUT BEFORE YOU IN YOUR BINDER THE FIRST FEW PAGES PROVIDE SOME OVER. I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THEM BUT IF YOU CAN TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT WILL BE USING THIS CHART TO KIND OF SUMMARIZE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEFT MOST COLUMN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN INCLUDES THREE MAJOR PROVISIONS. THE FIRST IS ONGOING FUNDING FROM THE NVA STARTING -- TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO POINT ONE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY A HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT DECLINE STEADILY TO THIRTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THE SECOND PIECE IS THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES -- PASSING ON CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION FEES TO CONSUMERS. AND THE THIRD PIECE IS -- BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AUTHORIZING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO AUGMENT DMV'S BUDGET UPON THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT IS LANGUAGE SIMILAR TO WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET. THIS YEAR. IF WE THEN LOOK AT THE TWO HOUSES PROPOSALS WILL TAKE THE FIRST TWO LINE ITEMS TOGETHER -- LOOKING AT THE SENATE PLAN THE SENATE PROVIDES ONGOING AND BE A FUNDING TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION IN 200-019-2200 AND SIXTY POINT ONE MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THEN IT GOES TO TEN MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO SUPPORT. IT AND TRAINING COSTS THE THE AMOUNT IS THE SAME AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROBE BUT IT DOES INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN ACCEPTED ADJUSTED UPWARD TO ACCOUNTFOR THE SENATE TO REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PASS ON THE CREDIT CARD FEES. ASSEMBLY ON THE OTHER HAND APPROVED ONE TIME AND BE A FUNDING OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PASS ON THE CREDIT CARD FEES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE THIRD LINE -- THIS IS THEN WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENCES RELATED TO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. THE SENATE APPROVED THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO AUGMENT DMV'S -- BUDGET WITHIN THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INSTEAD ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS A UPON LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION AFTER DMB DEMONSTRATES NEED AND PROGRESS IN MEETING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THE FINAL ITEM I'M ON THIS TABLE BEFORE YOU BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED SIMILAR REPORTING LANGUAGE -- THESE WOULD BE MONTHLY REPORTS ON CERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES INCLUDING OFFICE WAIT TIMES AND TECHNOLOGY OUTAGES. I'M IN A REVIEW OF THE PACKAGES THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN INCLUDED SOME KEY ELEMENTS THAT WE THOUGHT REALLY WOULD INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THE FIRST IS THAT IT PROVIDES ONE TIME FUNDING -- AND THE SECOND IS THAT IT REJECTS THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND SO BOTH OF THESE WOULD REQUIRE THAN THAT DMV COME FORWARD -- AND JUSTIFY HOW IT COULD USE THE MONEY IN THE PAST AND HOW IT PLANNED TO USE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY WOULD NEED AS WELL AS OUR PROGRESS IN MEETING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD DO IS IT WOULD PREVENT THE DEPARTMENT FROM SPENDING MONEY PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATING IT. AND THEN FINALLY -- PASSING ON THE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE DONE SUCH EXAMPLES INCLUDE FTP AND EIGHTY FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AN UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN AND FRUSTRATION. ISSUES OR JUST MAKE A COUPLE BRIEF POINTS. FOR STAYS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR MAY REVISION PROPOSAL -- WERE CONCERNED THAT UNDER THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WHICH THE FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS LESS IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE BUDGET. BY OUR CALCULATIONS THAT'S NEARLY SIX HUNDRED FEWER POSITIONS AT DMV RIGHT BEFORE THE REAL ID DEADLINE IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FUNDING SO THAT WAIT TIMES DO NOT. GO UP NEXT YEAR AND THAT TRAINING IS NOT DELAYED. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AROUND AUGMENTATION AUTHORITY AGAIN WITH EVERYTHING COMING TO A HEAD NEXT YEAR REGARDING REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE JAIL BC AUGMENTATION PROCESS IS THE RIGHT WAY IF IT TURNS OUT THAT WE DO NEED WAS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DMV THAT DOCKING OCCUR THROUGH THE JAIL BC PROCESS AND WE DO KNOW YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CONVENE TOGETHER FOR ANOTHER BUDGET BILL JUNIOR TO MAKE SURE THAT AUGMENTATION CAN TAKE PLACE. AND THEN THIRD ON THE CREDIT CARD FEES -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISSUE -- IT WOULD NOT UNLIKE THE ISSUES I WAS JUST DISCUSSING A FACT -- ARE PLANNED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN FOR THE DMV IN THE UPCOMING YEAR IT WOULD HAVE A DOWNSTREAM THE FACT ON THAT SOLVENCY OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT OR THE ABILITY OF THAT ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT OTHER CAPITAL. PROJECTS WE DO BELIEVE THAT PASSING ON CREDIT CARD FEES IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICES OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SO WE DO WANT TO STICK TO THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL -- AND SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AROUND OUR PROPOSAL. THANK YOU QUESTIONS [inaudible] WITH SKINNER [inaudible] I'M. THE CREDIT CARD FEE ISSUE WHILE. OTHER DEPARTMENTS MAY DO IT. I THINK WE HAVE A CLEARLY A A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM IN RELATIONSHIP [inaudible] TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND THE DMV. IN THAT -- AND IN SOME OF THIS IS. WAS NOT WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S MAKING IN OTHER WORDS THE FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO THESE REAL ID'S AND SUCH. AND WE KNOW THAT OTHER STATES ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING -- BUT WAIT TIMES IN DELAYS BECAUSE OF THIS NEW WORKLOAD. BUT EVEN PRIOR TO THEIR REAL ID'S. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST -- IF WE I THINK IF WE YOU FIVE VENTURE TO SAY THAT IF WE DID A POLL AND ASKED -- CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHAT WAS THEIR LEAST FAVORITE. STATE DEPARTMENT THEY MIGHT. INDICATE TO DMV SO I THINK IT IS WELL WORTH OUR WHILE. TO IN IN THE PLAN IN ANY PLAN THAT WE DO TO IMPROVE THAT CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND I THINK CHARGING. FOR THE CREDIT CARD FEES IS A BAD MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND FOR MOST OF US WE EVEN GO TO RETAIL FACILITIES THAT SAY EITHER THEY THEY WON'T ACCEPT A CREDIT CARD UNLESS IT'S UNDER CERTAIN SALES FOR THRESHOLD OR VARIOUS OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY. BUT BEYOND THAT. WE DON'T CHARGE. FOR PROCESSING OF A CHECK AND I'M SURE IN THIS CASE WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IN ANYBODY YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PAY THE CREDIT CARD FEET IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A CHECK WE'RE NOT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE PAYING CASH. SO CHECKS ARE QUITE COSTLY TO HANDLE ALSO THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF PERSONAL TIME TO PROCESS. AND THEN YOU CAN NEVER BAD CHECKS SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKED AT WHETHER -- I MEAN I ALWAYS FELT THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE STREAMLINING AND CUTTING COSTS JUST BY REALLY. INCREASING OUR ACCEPTANCE OF CREDIT CARDS IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF PAYMENTS -- SO. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD LOOK AT THAT THROUGH THAT LENS BECAUSE WHILE YES IT'S CLEAR THAT CREDIT CARDS -- COMPANIES CHARGE A PROCESSING FEE WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF COSTS JUST EMBEDDED IN THE PROCESSING OF CHECKS. SO I I WOULD GO WITH THE SENATE'S VERSION OF REJECTING THE PASSING ON OF THE CREDIT CARD FEES. THANK YOU ARTHUR MORE LUCK FALL BY SENATOR NIELSEN THE MANAGER AT HAVING BEEN. TREASURER FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND HAVING. TO PUT UP WITH THIS CONVENIENCE FEE WE ARE WHEN IT CAME TO PAYING PROPERTY TAXES. BUT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARD TO GET MILEAGE BUT SOME. BUT BRED TO IS THERE FOR THE IT ISN'T. AS IF -- THERE IS -- CHECKS ARE CHEAPER OR WHATEVER IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S VISA CHARGING A CONVENIENCE FEE AT ALL LIKE A AND AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOVERNMENT RATE. SO LIKE A REDUCED RATE FOR FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE. COLLECTING FUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS -- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COMPETING WITH OTHER RETAIL STORES TECH. COME INTO OUR OUR STORES WHICH IS WHERE CREDIT CARDS STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I RECEIVED WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE WORK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ABOUT GETTING BE SAID TO BE A LITTLE MORE -- ACCOMMODATING TO GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS -- I THINK DISCOVER CARD IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T CHARGE A FEE BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO BRING IT IN PERSON YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT OVER ONLINE. SO THE THE ARE THE OPTIONS YOU HAVE HEARD MAYBE TO TO CHARGE TO FEES. ONE FOR THOSE A PAY CHECK OR CASH IN AND SO LET'S SAY THAT'S TWENTY DOLLARS AND THEN THOSE THAT PAY WITH CREDIT CARD THAT'S TWENTY TWO OR YOU DO A BLENDED-RATE YOU SAY LET'S JUST CHARGE EVERYBODY TWENTY ONE SO WHAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE COME OUT EVEN BUT NOW YOU'RE PENALIZING THOSE THAT ARE WRITING CHECKS OR PAYING CASH -- BUT BUT I I I I I I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST. PAYING THE THE THE THE CREDIT CARD FEE -- AND IN TWO BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ADDED ON AS AN EXTRA FOR CREDIT CARDS AND SO I WOULD TAKE THE OPPOSITE. POSITION TO HAVE A LITTLE DEBATE THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. WELL I WOULD CONCUR ON THE CREDIT CARD ISSUE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A LITTLE BIT PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK IT WOULD ADD TO THE AGGRAVATION. FILL THE MOTORING PUBLIC. AND IN TERMS OF THE ONE YEAR FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO A LONGER TERM FUNDING. EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO KEEP THE DMV ON A SHORTEST LEASH I THINK IS REQUIRED. THE EARLY VIOLATED THE TRUST OF THE LEGISLATURE UNDER THE PEOPLE. AND I'M NOT FOR GIVING THEM MUCH MORE LATITUDE. I'M RATHER TO GIVE THEM A SHORTER LEASH WHERE WE CAN HAVE-MORE CONTROL. AND QUICKER QUICK THE MORE QUICKLY EXERCISE THAT CONTROL OVER DMV. SO THE LONGER TERM FUNDING IS NOT SUITABLE TO ME. I WOULD MISTER KING. NO FOR IT. I WAS GONNA GO SENATOR NIELSEN SOUND COMMENTS WE HEARD -- THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT A TESTIMONY OF LAST YEAR. ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT DMV WAS GOING TO DO. I CAN'T PROMISE AFTER PROMISE AFTER PROMISE BUT THEY DID DO WAS. HIRE PEOPLE BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IS TRAIN THEM. SO THEY COULDN'T GET THE FULL. SKILL OUT OF THEM BY NOT TRAINING THEM THEY COULDN'T WORK BEHIND THE DESK CAN USE COMPUTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT FORMS WERE USED BY THE DEPARTMENT REALLY HOW? TO HOW TO HELP THE CUSTOMERS WHO WERE STANDING IN. FAIRLY LONG LINES YOU KNOW I HAD CUSTOMERS IN IN MY AREA THAT THEY WOULD LINE UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. WE NEED TO GET IN DIEM BE AT NINE O'CLOCK -- SO OF COURSE TO WAIT TIMES THANKS TO LOOK LIKE -- THAT CUSTOMER ONLY WAITED TEN MINUTES BECAUSE THEY GOT THEIR FINE IN [inaudible] THAT. YOU KNOW THAT REALLY SHOULD BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO DO -- THE BASIC WORK AT THE DMV. WE ALSO GIVE MONIES FOR WIFI WE GAVE MONEY FOR TABLETS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS. THE MONEY THAT'S GIVEN WIFI THERE'S ONLY BEEN. ONE ONE AS OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY A FEW MONTHS AGO ONLY. ONE OFFICE ACTUALLY HAD EXTERNAL WIFI -- TABLETS WERE PURCHASED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EXTERNAL WIFI THE TABLETS CAN BE USED. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS HERE IS OUR LOT OF PROMISES AND NOT A LOT OF THE LIVER [inaudible] AND HILL WE EVEN HAD AN ACTING DIRECTOR COME IN FRONT OF BUDGET SUB. SIX TALK ABOUT -- ALL THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO DO. THAT ALL THE DEPUTIES WERE THERE WHEN THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR START SAYING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE IS. A SENSE THAT ANYBODY WAS REALLY. TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT. THEY SAID. THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE'LL ALL OUR PHONES LIGHT I MEAN YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S COUNSELED PEOPLE APPEAR. ON THE DíAS BECAUSE OUR PHONES RING. CALL US I KNOW. THAT -- DMV'S PROBABLY ONE OF OUR TOP FIVE OR TEN ISSUES THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OR THE CAN CAN APPOINTMENT THEIR ID'S ARE EXPIRING THEY THE GUEST AND APPOINTMENTS TO THE PLACES THAT ARE YOU KNOW. VERY FAR FROM HOME. SO AGAIN. WITH OUR APPROACH WITH THIS. APPROPRIATION WAS REALLY TO WE CAN ENSURE THAT. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HIRED OR IN THE PROCESS OF BEING HIRED. WERE ON GETTING THE PROBE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND THEN WITH HOLDING. THE ADDITIONAL MONEY WHICH AGAIN WAS ONLY -- ONLY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND AND AGAIN LET LET'S JUST LET'S JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT. DMV BUDGET IS A BILLION DOLLARS. SUITE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. DOLLAR AUGMENTATION EVEN A PART OF IT IS ONE TIME IS A 20% AUGMENTATION. SO IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE. AND KNOWING THE CRUSH THAT'S GONNA COM. WITH RELY DE I THINK THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE LET DIEM VIA. HI THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHER. MAKE SURE THEY'RE GONNA TRAIN THOSE PEOPLE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINED. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY HERE SAYING. DON'T COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE EVEN MID YEAR FOR A MAJOR AUGMENTATION BECAUSE WE NEED IT. BECAUSE AT THE END OF DAYS WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GO BY AND FOR THE LINES TO CONTINUE FOR THE LACK OF DELIVERY AND FOR THE INABILITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING. AT THIS POINT WE WE HAVE THE SAME HEARING HE WAS LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY. LAST YEAR IN AUGUST AND WE HAVE THE EXACT SAME HEARING WE HAD IN APRIL. NO DIFFERENCE IF THEY TOOK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS. THAT AGGRAVATION OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WAS NO LESS. AND THE STAKES ARE GETTING HIGHER BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO OUR REAL ID OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. SO AGAIN -- I PERSONALLY DIDN'T FEEL THAT THERE WAS A ACCOUNTABILITY AND ON THE PATH DEPARTMENT ARE. REALLY ON BEHALF OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT SO I THINK FOR ME IT'S MAKING SURE. THAT. THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDING IS PROPER OVERSIGHT WITHOUT TWO HUNDRED AGAIN A 20% AUGMENTATION I WOULD NOT. I WOULD THINK SHOULD BE PLENTY AND WITHHOLDING THE 40% FOR AGAIN YOU CAN COME BACK EVEN BEFORE I TO SESSION BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH. AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO HAVE THAT VOTED ON BUT AGAIN I THINK IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO WITHHOLD THAT -- FORTY MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE MONEY WAS FURTHER MISSPENT SO AGAIN IN THE IN THE CASE OF THE TABLETS OF THE WIFI THE MONEY WAS SPENT. THE RESOURCES JUST ONE USE. SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S EVEN WORSE TO FEEL LIKE TO TAXPAYERS MONEY WAS. WASTED ON THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT END UP USING. THANK YOU I THINK THAT I WOULD SAY THAT I I THINK -- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY BE CLEAR ABOUT OUR ROLE OF OVERSIGHT IN A PROPER LEVEL OVERSIGHT. VERSES A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DIRECTORS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICES -- WE HAVE A CLEAR ROLE TO PLAY AND YOU HAVE A CLEAR ROLE TO PLAY AS ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS. ON A AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS I SAID SAID PREVIOUSLY -- IT IS IN OUR COLLECTIVE BEST INTEREST TO MAKE SURE TO THE DMV IS A FUNCTION STATE DEPARTMENT IN THAT NEARLY EVERY LIFE IN CALIFORNIA'S TOUCHED BY THIS ONE DEPARTMENT. AND SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT US NEEDING TO BE PARTNERS IN THAT. I HAD A QUESTION -- IN LOOKING AT THE SIMPLEST PROPOSAL -- AND ASKING THAT -- ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING. REQUEST TO BE BROUGHT BACK -- TO THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE AS OPPOSED TO UTILIZING THE EXISTING -- G. L. B. C. PROCESS I GUESS MY CONCERN WITH THAT WOULD REALLY BE TIMING WE HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH MADE YOUR ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE EITHER THROUGH GOP CITY WHICH IS TYPICALLY UTILIZED WHEN WE ARE OUT OF SESSION THAT'SBEEN MY EXPERIENCE. THE LAST THREE YEARS THE GOP SEE CHAIR -- SPRING FINANCE LETTERS WHICH ARE IN SPRING -- OR THROUGH BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS YOU KNOW IT IF THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WERE TAKEN -- WHAT? YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF TIMING WHEN THESE. ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE MADE DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU HAVE CONCERN OF THE ASSEMBLY -- ACTION WE'RE TAKING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- YOU WOULDN'T GET THE RESOURCES YOU NEED IN A TIMELY MATTER FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S DURING OUR LEGISLATIVE RECESS. ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SO FOR THE D. -- ADMINISTRATION IN A AS IF YOU'RE A VICE CHAIR TING SAID. WE UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION HERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S BUILDING OVER A NUMBER OF NOT JUST MONTHS BUT YEARS. AHEAD AS YOU NOTED MADAM CHAIR WE SHARE THAT CONCERN THAT WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THE GOVERNOR FEELS THAT VERY DIRECTLY AS TO THE TOP MEMBERS OF HIS. ADMINISTRATION SO A LOT OF THOUGHT WENT INTO THIS PROPOSAL AND THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WE PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS SO. AT THIS POINT IT'S HARD FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROJECT WHAT EXTRA RESOURCES WE MIGHT NEED BECAUSE ALL OF THAT -- ALL THAT REASONING WENT INTO THE EXISTING LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL. AND WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. LEGISLATURE MAY BE IN SESSION WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR VERY QUICKLY IF WE DO NEED EXISTING RESOURCES. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF YEAR. THAT THAT QUICK PROCESS MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY IN A TIME FRAME THAT WE WOULD BE HOPING FOR THE DMV TO CONTINUE READING UP FOR THE PEAK OF REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT SUMMER THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS -- DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THAT PROCESS TAKES IT'S NOT SIMPLY THAT POSITIONS THEMSELVES BUT THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS ON TRAINING AND HIRING PEOPLE TO FILL THE NEXT SET OF POSITIONS. SO WE DO SHARE THAT CONCERN WAITING UP TO NEXT OCTOBER AND A BRIEF WE TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. BERNARD MARTIN FINANCE HERE THEN I WOULD JUST -- NOTED THAT -- THE TO THE JAIL BC PROCESS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE DMV WAS. GIVEN FUNDING TO HIRE AT A HIGHER UP THREE HUNDRED OF THE POSITIONS OR BEING REQUESTED. AND WE JUST -- AT AS OF TODAY I THINK THE DMV HAD MADE -- TWO HUNDRED OFFERS ALREADY AND THE FIRST MONTH AND THEY STILL HAVE ANOTHER MONTHS AGO -- AND OF THOSE A NINETY HAVE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN WORKING. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF AS AS WE APPROACH THE REAL ID DEADLINE. WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS RAMP UP AND IT INVOLVES THE OBVIOUSLY THE RECRUITMENT AND THEN. THE HIRING AND THEN THE COMBINATION OF GETTING THEM IN OFFICE EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING AND SO -- WITHOUT THESE FUNDS I THINK WE THEY COULD CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT RATE OF HIRING THROUGH -- MAYBE THE END OF JULY AND SO IF IF WE WERE TO TO NEED TO COME BACK FOR FUNDING. I COULD EASILY ENVISION THAT BEING YOU KNOW AS EARLY AS AUGUST. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE AS AS THE VICE CHAIR HAS REMINDED US OF THE TRAINING FALL POP IN THE PAST I CERTAINLY HOPE OF TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE BEING ON IN A COMPREHENSIVE FULL COMPLETE KIND OF WAY. THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD RAISE IS JUST THE THAT THE AREA THAT THE SENT ME SOME WE DO SUPPORT WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT OF MONTHLY REPORTING. ON AND I KNOW THAT A GREAT DEAL OF WORK IS BEING PUT INTO REALLY FIGURING OUT PERFORMANCE METRICS -- THAT ARE RELEVANT. I FOR ONE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN CREATING -- KIND OF A RONI IS MONTHLY REPORTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT PART MEASURING THE RIGHT THING AND GET US NOWHERE AND PULL -- PERSONNEL AWAY FROM. FRONTLINE PROBLEM SOLVING AND SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION OF AND AND COME TO SOME AGREEMENT ON WHAT THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS PERFORMANCE METRICS SHOULD BE -- TO QUELL THE UNREST AMONG THE LEGISLATURE SIDE SO WE ARE IN A POSITION OF HAVING -- DATA TO PERFORM OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE -- AND THAT YOU USE IT -- AS A TRUE METRIC IN TERMS OF SUCCESS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MEASURE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE YET. AND YOU KNOW OFFICE WAIT LINE TO TECHNOLOGY OUTAGES ARE A CHALLENGE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THOSE ARE MERE SYMPTOMS OF STRUCTURAL ISSUES IS THE ONE TO DIG DEEPER AND MAKING SURE WE'RE MEASURING THE RIGHT THING. SO AND SO I DO KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- THE BOTH HOUSES AGREE ON THAT AND AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING ON THE RIGHT MEASUREMENTS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEE NOT THE SCENE NONE. THAT AUTUMN WILL BE. LEFT TO OPEN. THANK YOU WE'RE MAKE ABOUT TO MAKE A TRANSITION TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WHERE WE WILL TALK ABOUT DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AUSTIN? CALIFORNIA HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. NO HELP OVERSIGHT SOCIAL SERVICES. THE PROBLEM EIGHTEEN X. AT OUR X. AT OUR EXPENSE. WITH A QUICK. MANY OUT MAN OF THE HOUR LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH ISSUE ONE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. KALLIO A GOOD AFTERNOON BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT PROVIDED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE CREATION OF THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED REVERTING THAT -- GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AND APPROVE PROPOSES A NEW GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT AS WELL AS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO RENAME THE COUNCIL THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIAFOR ALL COMMISSION. AND THE JUSTICE RESPONSIBILITIES TO EVALUATE OPTION SPECIFICALLY FOR A TRANSITION TO SINGLE PAYER. HEALTHCARE FINANCING SYSTEM. THE SENATE APPROVED THE REVERSION THE NEW APPROPRIATION AND THE ADOPTED PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WELL THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION FOR WHAT ISSUE HERE IS THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REVERSION. THE NEW APPROPRIATION AND THE TRAILER BILL IT JUST -- LANGUAGE THAT WOULD TRANSITION THE COUNCIL OVER TO THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION. THANK YOU FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS SENATE BUDGET ON THIS PROPOSAL. TAKE A NOTE [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS. WE CAN'T TAKE ACTION ON AYE READY. ALRIGHT ISSUE NUMBER TWO OFFICE OF HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND SONYA PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GOING TO TAKE THE ISSUES TWO AND THREE TOGETHER. OKAY GREAT. SO BOTH OF THESE ISSUES CONCERN -- THE OFFICE THE NEW OFFICE OF THIS A CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL WHICH IS HOUSED IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THE FIRST -- ISSUE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF SIX MILLION ONE TIME TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF HEALTHY AND SAFE SAFE COMMUNITIES UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SURGEON GENERAL WELL THE GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION -- THIS OFFICE WOULD PROVIDE OR DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE VIOLENCE PREVENTION STRATEGY ACROSS VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE IS -- RELATED TO A REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE HOUSED UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. OF THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED TWO POSITIONS IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR THE SURGEON GENERAL. TO ANNUALLY REPORT PUBLIC HEALTH DATA TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT DESCRIBES THE STATE OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH. THE GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE DID NOT TAKEN ACTION -- WE RECOMMEND -- APPROVAL OF THIS ASSEMBLY IS ACTION THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REALLY PROVIDE CONCISE ANNUAL REPORTING TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY AS THEY ENTER INTO BUDGET DELIBERATIONS EACH YEAR IT SORT OF SETS THE STAGE WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH% ISSUES. AND TRENDS -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AS IT DELIBERATES ON THE BUDGET FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS SENATE BUDGET ON BOTH OF THESE ISSUES -- ON THE FIRST ISSUE THIS IS IN PART OF OUR CURRENT NAY REVISION PLAN AND SHOULD ALSO BRIEFLY NOTE ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUES NOT SPECIFICALLY -- ON THE CONFERENCE AGENDA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED FUNDING. AND ON THE SECOND ISSUE THAT LA -- MENTIONED WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF REPORTING ROLE IS BEST SITUATED WITHIN THE EXISTING DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- RELEASE SUCH A REPORT THE DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELEASE SUCH REPORT THIS YEAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT AND SOLD LA L. IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO COME FROM. THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL WHO. I SHOULD WILL FAIL AN ASIDE STATUTORILY DOESN'T EXIST IT WAS CREATED TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE ABOUT WHEN THAT'S GOING TO BE RESOLVED AND I'LL COME BACK TO THE FINANCE ON THAT. BUT WAS IT YOUR POINT WE WE ACTUALLY ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION ON WHETHER IT'S HOUSED IN OFFICES SURGEON GENERAL OR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND I WOULD JUST REMIND MEMBERS THAT THE REASON THE DEPARTMENT DID PRESENT SUCH A REPORT. AT THE BEGINNING A BUDGET HEARINGS THIS YEAR WAS DUE TO SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET. OF FROM LAST YEAR AND SO IF IT IS HOUSED IN THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL -- THE POSITION THE TWO STAFF MEMBERS THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS APPROPRIATION WOULD MORE. A MOST LIKELY BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- TO DEVELOP THIS ANNUAL REPORTING [inaudible] THANK YOU. IN THE ARE ALSO FINANCE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS WAS CONSIDERED AND PUTTING FOR THE THE BUDGET -- FOR A THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THAT ACTION WOULD HAVE TAKEN WAS THE FACT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH CAN LEVERAGES SOME OF ITS EXISTING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS REPORT WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ALSO THINK IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- WITH REGARDS TO THE PREVIOUS ISSUE ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH CURRENTLY HAS A VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVE WHICH WE BELIEVE I HAVE SOME DUPLICATE OF WORK IN THAT SPACE AS WELL SO WE BELIEVE PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE. ENTITY. THANK YOU AND BACK -- TO ISSUE TO TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- IS THERE A PLAN -- TO PUT IN STATUTE THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE THAT WOULD DETAIL KIND OF EXPECTATIONS ALL THINGS THAT STATUTE CURRENTLY REFLECTS FOR OTHER. DEPARTMENTS IN COMMISSION TO WHATEVER THEY HAVE BEEN CREATED YES SO ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR I CREATED YOU KNOW APPOINTED THE SURGEON GENERAL NEAR THE BEGINNING OF HIS ADMINISTRATION. ARE MAY REVISION BUDGET INCLUDES AN OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL COMPLETE WITH SEVERAL FUNDED POSITIONS. BUT IT DOESN'T PUT THE POSITION OF THE OFFICE OF SURGEON GENERAL IN STATUTE ROCKET REFERENCES IT BUT IT DOES IT. ACTUALLY INCLUDE IN STATUTE THE OFFICE ITSELF. WE'VE BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT AND SO ARE WE GOING TO THAT MY POINT IS ARE WE GOING TO DO ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT OR NOT AT SOME POINT. I SHOULD LOOK INTO THE OKAY APPRECIATED I'M JUST CURIOUS IT WILL BE DONE TO LEGISLATION IT SEEMS TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW HELPFUL HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BUT IF YOU WOULD GET BACK TO ME ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU JUST TO MAYBE FOLLOW UP ON ON THIS SO FOLLOWING UP ON AND YOUR COMMENTS RIGHT THERE ON THE POSITION. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES TWO AND THREE WHICH BOTH. HAVE RESOURCES AND WORK THAT WOULD BE DONE BYTHAT SURGEON GENERAL ON FULLY SUPPORT THAT. FOR HER WORK IN FRANKLIN CALIFORNIA LAST YOU KNOW DECADE OR SO. AND THE WORK HERE AT AND I GUESS IT'S NOT A CONFERENCE BUT WHO WHO. WHAT WAS APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES TO FIND? HER POSITION AND THE AND THE WORK THAT ACCURATE NO SO BOTH HOUSES ACTUALLY REJECTED THE ASSOCIATED FUNDING IN POSITIONS -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED. GOTCHA AND SO THESE TWO ACTIONS I'M CONFUSED AND HOW TO THESE TO RELATE TO THAT THAT THEY'RE JUST SEPARATE. THE CITY REJECTED THE SO -- I SMITE AWAY -- SPEAK TO THAT. IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS STILL AN ISSUE THAT'S MAYBE BEING DISCUSSED AT THE IT IT'S A NEITHER HOUSE TOOK ACTION ON THE MAY BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. OKAY AND WHAT WAS THAT AMOUNT THAT IN THE NAVY BASE FOR THAT. YOU TOO WE NEED TO LOOK UP I BELIEVE IT'S RIVER WAS. SIX POSITION IS ABOUT SIX SIX POSITIONS AND WE CAN LOOK UP THE ASSOCIATED FUNDING NUMBER. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THE ROGER -- THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS DOCTOR KAREN LEE SMITH. IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST IN. ONE OF HER PREDECESSORS WAS ACTUALLY THE CHIEF MEDICAL. ORANGE COUNTY AND AND SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN THAT POSITION. TO OVERSEE ALL OF THE HEALTH OF OF OF THE STATE AND ITS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND I'M. I'M TRYING [inaudible] TO FIGURE OUT. THE EFFICACY OF A A SURGEON GENERAL IS IT IS A DUPLICATIVE IS A REDUNDANT. OF YOURS A VISIONARY I'M. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WAS NOT OCCURRING THAT. REQUIRED THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO RESOLVE. WHAT WAS NOT BEING DONE SO ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY BRIEFLY THAN HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL SO THE OUGHT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH CONTINUES TO PLAY? THE KEY ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. HOW THE GOVERNOR AND ADMINISTRATION -- ENVISIONING THE SURGEON GENERAL AS SOMEONE WHO IS A CLEAR LEADER ON SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ARE KEY TO PUBLIC HEALTH -- ON ISSUED ON IN THIS CASE EARLY CHILDHOOD ISSUES SO IN THE FIRST APPOINTEE DOCTOR NADINE BURKE HARRIS HAS REALLY DEVELOPED -- EXPERTISE AND PROGRAMS WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THE CHILD TO TRAUMA WITH ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND SO WE SEE THIS OFFICE AS REALLY SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES. CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION. WOULDN'T A POSITION LIKE THAT BE BETTER. SITUATED WITH THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A REVENUE SOURCE WITH PROP. TEN SO THE SO THE FIRST TYPE IS ONGOING AND AND THERE ARE NUMBER PROGRAMS FUNDED. AND THAT HAS BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL PRESENCE WE REALLY SEE THIS OFFICE AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND REFLECTING SOME THESE KEY PRIORITIES THAT NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR. HAS PUT SO MUCH TIME AND THOUGHT INTO BUT MANY OF THE LEGISLATORS AS WELL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CAN YOU SEE NONE THANK YOU BLOOM KEY HOLE THAT I PUT OUT ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH WORKSOURCE DEVELOPMENTS. BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA -- AGAIN. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ONE TIME GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS AT THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THE SENATE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT ALLOCATED ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS FUNDING TO PROVIDE LOAN REPAYMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR FORMER FOSTER USED TO OUR SERVING AS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IT THE SENATE ALSO APPROVED TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING FOR PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIPS. THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S A PROPOSAL BUT SET ASIDE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND DEDICATED TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR IT TO FUND PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP SO THE DIFFERENCES HERE TODAY THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING ARE THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FOR FORMER FOSTER USE -- THAT ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSES ONE MILLION IN THE SENATE. AND THEN THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIPS WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE A PART OF THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION OR WOULD BE SEPARATELY FUNDED ON TOP OF THE THE FIFTY MILLION WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DOLLARS. THANK YOU OF FINANCE PLEASE IN MINISTRATION SUPPORTS FIFTY NINE DOLLAR PREPARATION BUT WITHOUT SET ASIDES TO PRESERVE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] THURROCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE SENATE IS PROPOSING TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS. DOES THAT REQUIRED SPECIFIC LEGISLATION OR DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MHSAA -- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WOULD REQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION AYE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS FROM THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE CAP WHICH IS HISTORICALLY FUNDING THAT THE STATE HAS USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. YOU KNOW FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RELATED ACTIVITIES AND AND AND THIS SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE USE. Q. AND THEN ARM HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEEL WITH THE IDEA THIS PROPOSED BY BOTH THE SIN IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT IS TO FIND. PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIPS. SO IT'S NOT IN OUR PROPOSAL ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO PROVIDE SOME DETAILS. GEN ONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THIS REQUEST BY THE INCLUSION BY THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSISTENT WITH A ONE MILLION DOLLAR. GRANT FOR THE SAME PROGRAM THOSE INCLUDED LAST YEAR -- WE WILL NOTE THAT THE GRANT LAST YEAR WAS FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN AS OF FEBRUARY THE GRANT CYCLE HAS CLOSED AND OF THAT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ARE SPENT ONLY GRANTED SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO THIS PROGRAM WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS GENERALLY RUN BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND PRIME MAKES MORE SENSE TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THAT DEPARTMENT. ORANGE COUNTY'S ONLY PRODUCING NINE PSYCHIATRIST A YEAR WE HAVE SUCH A DEMAND. SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WE CAN DO. TO KIND OF HELP. PRIME THE PUP. SO -- DROPPING IT COMPLETELY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER SO MAYBE WE PUT IN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THIS YEAR. I THINK CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES BROUGHT FLEXIBILITY THAT WHICH COULD INCLUDE FUNDING FOR PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP. THIS SPECIFIC AUGMENTATION BY THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTS THESE DOLLARS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE SINGLE PROGRAM WHICH IS OPERATE AT UC DAVIS AND UC IRVINE. SO THE OF ADMINISTRATIONS VIEW OF THIS PROPOSALS TO REMIT -- MAINTAIN THAT BROUGHT FLEXIBILITY OKAY THEN I SAY DROP UC DAVIS [inaudible] JUST GETTING -- JUST A LITTLE LEVITY. THANK YOU VERY MUC THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL THIS ITEM OPEN ISSUE. FIVE SIXTY FIVE PUBLIC USE FILE ACCESS A STRICTLY OFSHE BED MADE AVAILABLE PUBLIC USE FILES WHICH ARE DATA SETS THAT SHOW PATIENT LEVEL HOSPITAL INPATIENT UTILIZATION DATA. THESE DATA SETS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE -- AS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THE GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS ITEM AND THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION RELATED TO THIS ITEM THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL TO RESTORE ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC USE FILES AT CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE. FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ON THIS ITEM. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. XENA THANK YOU ISSUE SIX THREE VERSION AJ BED [inaudible] ALEA. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- PER ALLOCATED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SPREAD TO DEVELOP AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. THE GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS ITEM. AND THIS CURRENT YEAR. THE SENATE REVERTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION -- THAT WAS ALLOCATED HERE -- WHILE THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDNG THAT UNDER THE SENATE'S ACTION IT'S NOT A SIGNAL OF NOT WISHING -- TO PURSUE THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE ANYMORE BUT INSTEAD IT THE ENCOURAGES OFSHE PAD TO SEEK THROUGH BUDGET PROPOSALS ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE WE WERE JUST BRING UP A COUPLE CONSIDERATIONS -- ON ONE ON THE ONE HAND WE DO THINK IT IT DOES HAVE THE REVERSION DOES HAVE POTENTIAL -- TO DIMMITT MITIGATE THE MOMENTUM OF CREATING THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA BASIC -- AS AJ BED IS CURRENTLY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS -- CARRYING OUT CONTRACTS AND SO FORTH ON THE OTHER HAND GOING THROUGH -- THE THE THE STANDARD SORT OF BUDGETARY PROCESS COULD CREATE -- INCREASE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AS NEW BUDGET PROPOSALS WOULD COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR THE NEXT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATABASE [inaudible] FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY ON THIS PROPOSAL AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL COULD WAIT TO UNCERTAINTY WAITING TO DELAYS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DATABASE COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MR MAYES YEAH I JUST WANTED TO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT FROM BY THE ADMINISTRATION DOES BE SUPPORT OF OF THIS -- OF THIS INITIATIVE -- FOR THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE -- THIS WAS A A BIG WIN -- BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT -- IT SEEMS TO BE THE THE KEY TERM -- IN REGARDS TO HEALTH CARE BUT THE TRUTH IS AND MAYBE I'D EVEN CALLED THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET IS THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO CONTAIN COSTS WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. AND THIS PROGRAM THIS INITIATIVE -- TO BE FULLY FUNDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA SO WE CAN START TO UNDERSTAND. HOW IMPORTANT AND WHAT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE OF REDUCE COSTS I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT? I GUESS I DON'T REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND AT THE SENATE PROPOSAL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE THEY CAN CAN SPEAK TO THAT -- BUT I DO THINK THAT -- IF IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE SENATE PROPOSAL THEN THERE WOULD BE UNCERTAINTY AND WHETHER THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO GO FORWARD. I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEANING AND LIKE YOU HAVE THE ANSWER. ANY OTHER SENATOR NIELSEN. THE VERBIAGE HERE WOULD APPEAR TO ME. TO INDICATE THAT THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S BODY AND TO THIS ALL PAYER. PLAN IS THAT CORRECT OR IS THIS JUST GOING TO BE AN ADDRESS STEP TOWARDS EVALUATING. THE MERITS FOR THE DEMERITS THIS REACHED ANYMORE LIKE IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SUBSTANTIATE NOT REALLY REVIEW. SO THIS IS SPECIFICALLY -- FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT FOR THE CREATION OF A DATABASE OKAY. MISTER MOORE Là. SO ANSWERED MY QUESTION SIXTY MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED FIVE MILLION WAS SPENT ANTICIPATED SPENT FIVE MILLION THIS YEAR. LEAVES FIFTY MILLION AND SPENT. LOADING SEEMS LIKE INSTEAD OF JUST KEEPING AN OPEN CHECKBOOK YOU PULL THE FIFTY MILLION BACK. AND THEN IT HAVE THIS DEPARTMENT COME BACK TO YOU [inaudible] FOR AN APPROPRIATION TWO YEARS HENCE RATE. SO IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING TIMELINE THE BILL THAT REQUIRE THIS DATABASE TO BE CREATE ALSO REQUIRED TO STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- DEVELOP A CHOIR INPUT AND DEVELOPMENT WHEN LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT. OFFERED WOULD COLLECT FOR THESE PURPOSES AND SO THERE HAS BEEN A APPROXIMATELY ESTIMATE TEN LINE TO BE SPENT AND KERN YOUR AND BUDGET YEAR HOWEVER AND BUT YOUR PLUS. ONE THE THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT DATABASE AND IT IS US MAN RIGHT NOW THAT DAVIS WILL START IMPLEMENTATION -- START DEVELOPING THAT DATABASE AND BUDGET YEAR PLUS -- ONE ONE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT DATABASE HE WILL GO THROUGH THE REGULAR -- PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE DOCUMENTATION WITH ALL IT PROJECTS AND SO THERE WILL BE SOME FOR THE VISIBILITY ON THAT BUT IN TERMS OF THE SLOWER RAMP UP IS BECAUSE AUTHORED AND FOCUSED ON THAT STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP TOGETHER THE INPUT FOR THE DAY THAT THEY'LL BE MOST USEFUL. FOR INDIVIDUALS LONG START COLLECTING IT. THANK YOU SEEM SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONLINE CAMPUS ALL STOP HERE. THANK YOU MANAGER. KING STOPPED AFTER HE SAID IT BUT OKAY STOP. FULLER ROBB FOLLOWED BY SENATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING. WELL IF IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE PROJECT CLOSE SO APPROVAL PROCESS HAVE YOU DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST. I MEAN I WASN'T INVOLVED IN THIS AND I DIDN'T I DON'T SIT ON THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE SO I HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT PROJECTS IN THE PAST. THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION I THINK WHEN THIS. AUGMENTATION AND PROPOSAL WAS INITIALLY BUILT ON THE BUDGET LAST YEAR -- AT THAT TIME THERE WAS AGREED UPON THAT SIXTY NINE WAS A GOOD PLACE TO START I THINK IF THE PROJECT ENDS UP COMING IN LOWER THERE WOULD DEFINITELY BE SAVING CELL RIVER AT THAT TIME. IF IT COMES IN HIRE WE WILL HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT WE WILL BRING FOR THIS LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU THE MANAGER. HOMELESS SITTING. I I WOULD YEAH I WOULD JUST ECHO-- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MADE HIS COMMENTS I MEAN THIS WAS. PART OF A BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT WE DID LAST YEAR -- IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STEP THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE TOWARD. UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS COST CONTAINMENT. ON HIS WEEDS FAMILY DIFFICULT. TO FURTHER EXPAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT THE COSTS ARE AND IF THERE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND BETTER IN A WAY TO DO IT SO THIS WAS. SEEN AS A VERY GOOD FIRST STEP WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUING. TO FOLLOW UP AND GET THE STATED BASED ON BUT WE DO KNOW OR AT LEAST. AT LEAST THE ASSEMBLY FELT THAT. WITHOUT THIS FIRST THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET AT TWO OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES SURROUNDING HEALTH CARE ONE ON COST CONTAINMENT AS WELL AS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE THAT THIS DATABASE HAVE HAVING THESE DATA. WAS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TO REALLY GET WRITING GET RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO WE CONTINUE TO BE VERY SUPPORT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] WITH SKINNER. I'M THIS MAY HAVE COME UP SO APOLOGIES YOU CAN STOP ME IF IT'S ALREADY ASKED WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH STAFF BUT A NOTE THAT THE LA YO -- IT XPRESSBET. OUR NOT OKAY POLICIES. DONE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MOVING ON ISSUE SEVEN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX. LA -- WE'VE DONE WE SHOULD ALL HAVE IN YOUR PACKETS A HAND OUT THAT WE CREATED ON THE MCO TAX NO USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR MY REMARKS HERE. ON PAGE ONE THE JUST PROVIDE -- SOME BRIEF BACK BACKGROUND -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS RULES THAT REGULATE STATE'S HEALTH CARE RELATED TAXES TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE USED TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS. WITH THE THE PRINCIPALLY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL APPROVAL A STATE MUST PROVE THAT I AT THAT HEALTH CARE RELATED TAX DOES NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY OR I SHOULD SAY TO DISPROPORTIONATELY FALLEN MEDICAID AS OPPOSED TO NON MEDICAID. SERVICES. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A TAX ON HEALTH CARE RELATED TAX ON MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS OR M. CEOS IT IS HAVE THIS TAX SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND IS A PER MEMBER PER MONTH TAX ON MEDI CAL AND COMMERCIAL ENROLLMENT -- WITHIN M. CEOS IT FEATURES A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE -- WHERE BY THE TAX RATE VARIES BASED ON MEDI CAL VERSUS COMMERCIAL OR NON MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS BY THE ENROLLMENT -- THE NUMBER OF ENROLLEES THAT MCO HAS THIS TAX THE CURRENT TAX EXPIRES AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INCLUDED IN THE NCO TAX PACKAGE WERE SOME REDUCTIONS TO SOME OTHER TAT STATE TAXES THAT NCOS% PAY. US SPECIFICALLY TO THEIR CORPORATION TAXES ON THEIR ON THEIR MCO INCOME AS WELL AS ON THE INSURANCE PREMIUM REVENUE GENERATED BY CORPORATE AFFILIATES OF THE MCO. THE EXISTING TAX IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS ESTIMATED TO GENERATE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT TAKING ACCOUNT BOTH OF THE REVENUES AS WELL AS THE REDUCE STAFF -- THE REVENUES FROM THE MCO TAXES WAS THE REDUCE STEMS REVENUES FROM THAT CUTS TO THE CORPORATION AND INSURANCE TAXES. TURNING TO PAGE -- TWO WHILE THE MCO TAX DOES GENERATE THIS -- THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IS ACTUALLY ESTIMATED TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY OVERALL. NO WORSE OFF SO THEIR NET TAXES UNDER THE FULL -- MCO DEAL AS AN INDUSTRY ARE NOT X. ARE ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE NOT INCREASED -- OVER WHAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE pCERTAIN PLANS CERTAIN THEM CIOS TO SEE THEIR TAX LIABILITY GOING UP WHILE OTHERS SEE IT DECREASING. THE MCO TAX EXPIRES AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR -- AND THIS WILL ELIMINATE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. TURNING TO PAGE -- THREE LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- THIS YEAR REQUESTED THAT THE LA L. MODEL -- OPTIONS FOR RE AUTHORIZED MCO TAX PACKAGE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. CHANGES IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY MOST NOTABLY -- CHANGE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE MARKET AS WELL AS CHANGES OVER TIME IN MCO ENROLLMENT. WE HAD SEVERAL OBJECTIVES THAT WE WERE -- PURSUING IN IN MODELING -- RE AUTHORIZE TAX NUMBER ONE THAT IT COMPLIES WITH THE FEDERAL RULES ON HEALTH CARE RELATED TAXES. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS. TWO WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THE NET GENERAL FUND ENEFIT -- OVER THE SO ACT OR ABOVE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR NET BENEFIT. THREE WAS PROTECT VULNERABLE AND CEOS FROM NEGATIVE IMPACTS US SOME M. CIOS. CAN SEE LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR TAX LIABILITY BUT ARE COMPENSATED BY ANY OFFSETS -- ESPECIALLY SOME SMALL ONES SO WE LOOK TO MINIMIZE THOSE IMPACTS. AND THEN WE ALSO TRIED TO MINIMIZE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE INDUSTRY OVERALL -- FOR EXAMPLE WE TRIED. TO REDUCE THE VARIATION BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL RATES EFFECTIVE -- COMMERCIAL TAX RATES THAT DIFFERENT M. CIOS WOULD PAY -- THEREFORE LEVELING -- LEVELING REALLY LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD IN TERMS OF THAT THE OVERALL TAX THEIR THEM COS TAX LIABILITY. WOULD PROVIDED SEVERAL OPTIONS -- ONE WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING MCO TAXES TEARS AND RATES BUT APPLY IT TO UPDATED ENROLLMENT. TO WOULD BE TO MARGINALLY INCREASE -- THAT TAX RATES BUT KEEP THE TAX TEARS THE SAME AND THEN THREE WOULD BE TO KEEP THE TAX TEARS BUT REALLY SICK MORE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY THE RATES -- AND ALL THREE OF THESE OPTIONS OVERALL INCLUDED TO THE OFFSETS TO OR THE REDUCTIONS TO THE CORPORATION AND INSURANCE TAXES -- UNDER UNDER OUR MODEL THIS THIRD OPTION WITH THE MORE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED RATES INCREASE THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO. LEFT THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY BETTER OFF THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE OTHER OPTIONS. TURNING TO PAGE -- FIVE HERE WE'RE GOING TO COMPARE THE MCO TAX PACKAGES OF THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS THE TWO HOUSES. THE GOVERNOR AS YOU ALL KNOW DID NOT PROPOSE AN EXTENSION OF THAT -- MCO TAX PACKAGE THE THEIR BY FOR GOING IN THE ONE POINT FIVE FOR MORE BILLION DOLLAR NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. THE SENATE APPROVED A THREE YEAR RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE MCO TAX WITH THE MODIFIED RATES GENERATING IN THAT GENERAL FUND BENEFIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED A FOUR YEAR RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE TAX -- WITH THE MODIFIED RATES. AND THIS ALSO WAS THE PACKAGE THAT WOULD GENERATE THE NET GENERAL OF THE BENEFIT OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. SO ULTIMATELY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BOTH ADOPTED REALLY THE SAME MCO TAX PACKAGE -- THE ONE THAT GENERATES THE GREATEST NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT AND THE ONE THAT REDUCES -- OR GENERATES ALSO THE GREATEST FISCAL BENEFIT FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THAT WE HAD THAT WE HAD MODELED AT THAT TIME -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX WE HAVE A WE HAVE A FIGURE THAT REALLY SUMMARIZES THAT MODEL I WON'T GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS. OF THAT BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT STRUCTURED AND HOW IT IT IMPROVES. THE OVERALL OUTCOMES. THE FIGURE -- THEN THE FIGURE ON PAGE SEVEN SUMMARIZES LE THOSE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT AS WELL AS THE NET FISCAL BENEFIT FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY SO YOU SEE THAT THE THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD INCREASE BY ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE THE MODEL. THAT WAS ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES. AND THAT THE NET FISCAL BENEFIT FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY WOULD INCREASE FROM OF FIVE OR CLOSE TO ZERO BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE TO THAT CLOSER TO NINETY THREE YEAR CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUMMARIZE THE DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THE MADE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THAT TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH THE HOUSES WOULD RE AUTHORIZE THE TAX THE SENATE RE AUTHORIZED FOR THREE YEAR PERIOD AND THE ASSEMBLY RE AUTHORIZE THEM CO TAX PACKAGE FOR A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THE REMAINING DIFFERENCES REALLY REFLECTED TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF NGUYEN SAVINGS FROM THE TAX OR WHEN THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IS REALLY -- MATERIALIZING WITHIN HOW WEAK ACCOUNT. FOR ACCOUNT FOR THE ULTIMATE SAVINGS THE SENATE APPROVED A PACKAGE WHERE BY THE STATE MORE SAVINGS WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- WHEREAS THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT A PACKAGE WHERE A SOMEWHAT LESSER SAVINGS WOULD MATERIALIZE ADDITIONALLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR I'D NOTE THAT ANY SAVINGS THAT DON'T INITIATIVE THAT DON'T MATERIALIZE IN THAT BUDGET YEAR WOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS SO THIS IS REALLY A TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE. AS TO THE TIMING OF WHEN THE SAVINGS ARE THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD MATERIALIZE. TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT WE PROVIDE A A MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK ON WHILE WINDOWS SAVINGS WOULD OR THE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD MATERIALIZE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BOTH IN TERMS OF THE FIRST YEAR -- HOW MUCH THE HOW MUCH SAVINGS WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND THEN ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR AND THAT'S PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE LONGER TIME PERIOD RE AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE ASSEMBLIES PACKAGE? OF THOUGH RIGHT MOST COLUMN JESS IS THERE TO INDICATE THAT FOR ALL THE YEARS OF THE TAX WOULD BE RE AUTHORIZED THE AVERAGE NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IS IDENTICAL BETWEEN THE HOUSES. NEXT JUST TURNED TO A A FEW LA OF COMMENTS THAT WE SENT OVER TO STAFF -- THERE ARE SOME KEY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING -- FOR EXAMPLE -- WE HAVEN'T ESTABLISHED OUT YOUR TAX RATES THAT WE WOULD WANT TO APPLY AND IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN -- THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR -- GENERAL FUND BENEFIT YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO INCREASE THOSE TAX RATES MARGINALLY ON A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS -- ALSO WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON WHICH IS THE MOST -- TECHNICALLY ACCURATE REFLECTION OF WHAT SAVINGS OR BENEFIT WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND WE REALLY -- WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASKING ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT THE BEST ASSUMPTIONS ARE -- FOR WHAT SAVINGS ARE MOST LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE -- DURING DURING THE BUDGET WINDOW SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FROM FINANCE FIRST AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP TO COMMITTEE. SAID THE NCO TAX HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WITH ASSOCIATE REVENUES UP FINANCING THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THAT WAY IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER GIVEN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT -- WE KNOW THAT APPROVAL OF AN EXTENSION OF THIS TAX IS UNCERTAIN FOR THAT REASON THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION. DO NOT SUPPORT INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATED REVENUES WERE ALLOCATION OF THOSE REVENUES AS PART OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND FOR THAT SAME REASON THE BUDGET THAT WE PUT FORWARD INTHE NAY REVISION. FUNDS THE GOVERNOR'S AT NEW HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE PROPOSALS WITHOUT RELYING ON MCO TAX REVENUE. THE GOVERNOR IN THE MINISTRATION ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE LATER THIS SESSION ON FIGURING OUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD IN BUILDING THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE CASE FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE MTO TAX. THAT WILL MEET FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVAL BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. SENATOR MOORE Là FOLLOWED BY MR MAYS AND MISTER MCCARTY THIRTY MORE LAW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE THE SIM CO WAS PART OF A SPECIAL SESSION A FEW YEARS AGO AND HAD THE JOY OF SERVING. ON THAT AS WELL. AND IT WAS A RUBIK'S CUBE TO CONSTRUCT THE TAX STRUCTURE OF OF AND SO ON PAGE SIX YOU KIND OF SEE [inaudible] HOW? UNIQUE IT IS WHERE [inaudible] WE'RE CHARGING. NCOS WITH SMALLER ENROLLMENTS A LOT MORE THAN WE ARE WITH THE WITH LARGE ENROLLMENTS. IN SO I'M CURIOUS ABOUT A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS. WHAT HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER OF MERGERS? SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHEN IT WAS IMPLEMENTED -- I CAN I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT EXACT ANSWER A COUPLE OF THE MAJOR ONES -- THAT WEREN'T NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN LAST PACKAGE WHERE -- BLUESHIELD -- PURCHASING A MEDI CAL PLAN KNOWN AS FORMALLY KNOWN AS CARE FIRST. AS WELL AS CENTENE CORPORATION -- PURCHASING HEALTH NET SO THOSE ARE THE MAJOR -- THE MAJOR CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY. AND WAS THE MCO TAX A COMPONENT OF THE DECISION PROCESS YOU KNOW. I'M NOT AWARE OF IT BEING A A MAJOR COMPONENT THERE AND YOU HAVE A H. C. S. P.. IT DOES IS THAT REFERRING TO JUST NONPROFIT HOSPITAL NCOS VERSES FOR PROFIT -- NOT NECESSARILY THAT IT REALLY IT DID AS A SET OF CRITERIA THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET TODAY TO MEET THE CRITERIA AS AN H. C. S. P.. AND KAISER -- HEALTH PLAN IS THE ONLY -- HEALTH PLAN THAT MEETS THOSE CRITERIA CURRENTLY. OKAY SO THE KAISER PERMANENTE IMPACT IS IS SEEN. WITH THIS ONE THROUGH EIGHT MILLION. YES AND SO THAT IS NOT THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT ALL OF THEIR LIVES IT ACTUALLY -- STOPS AND AT A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE THEIR ENROLLEES RESERVED DISTINCTION ON THE TAX BASED ON WHETHER YOU ARE FOR PROFIT TAXABLE VERSES A NONPROFIT NON TAXABLE NOT ON THE MCO TAX SIDEBUT THE THE RELATED REDUCTIONS ON THE CORPORATION TAX SIDE TO PLAY INTO WHETHER OR NOT YOU. CAN -- HEALTH PLAN CAN RECEIVE ANY OFFSETS FOR SOME OF THE LIABILITIES THAT THEY WOULD FACE UNDER THE MCO TAX PROPER. DOES THAT INCLUDE TAX CREDITS -- I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE TAX CREDIT QUESTION. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THIS WAS -- EARLY INTO ME BEING -- AT THE LEADER ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND I REMEMBER IT WAS SORT OF THE FIRST -- DEAL -- THAT WE HADN'T DONE WITH THE WITH THEN I GOVERNOR BROWN. AND I REMEMBER SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING -- INTERNALLY WITHIN OUR CAUCUS WE WE GET TOGETHER -- YOU KNOW TEN OR ELEVEN OF US AND WHAT WE IT AT THE TIME I MEMBER UNDERSTANDING IT -- AS MUCH AS ONE COULD UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE IT IS A BIT OF A A RUBIK'S CUBE AND MEMBER OF MAKING THE ARGUMENT. ABOUT THESE ARE FEDERAL FEDERAL DOLLARS -- AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS ON NEVER FORGET THIS SAID -- THAT CHAD IF YOU'RE ON TEAM CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO SUPPORT THIS -- AND AND I THINK THAT STILL THE CASE -- WE ARE A DONOR STATE HOW WE SEND MORE MONEY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAN WHAT WE RECEIVE FROM THEM AND I HAVE GOT A LITTLE CONSTERNATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ISN'T -- ISN'T THINKING THAT WE SHOULD GO FORWARD WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE WAY. I'M EVEN THE RUBIK'S CUBE AND THAT IT IS FOR US TO GET SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THAT WE HAVE THAT WE SEND -- SEND -- THAT THAT WAY I HOPE AND AND I DON'T WANNA AND SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE CASE. BUT I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT -- WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THE THE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ONE AGREE -- TO TO TO OUR PROPOSAL -- BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE RHETORIC -- THAT IS BEEN GOING TO HELP THE POLITICS IT DOESN'T GET IN TO THIS I'VE BEEN -- MYSELF A CRITIC OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN THEY ARE WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SUPPORTING LIKE THE WILD FIRES NOT MAKING SURE THAT WE GOT GET OUR RESOURCES. BECAUSE THE RHETORIC BUT IT GOES BOTH THE BILL GOES BOTH WAYS THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE GOT IN BEFORE I DO SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY PLAN. JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT FROM THAT DEPARTMENT PLEASE THAT AND IN RESPONSE FOR SOME WHATEVER MAYES AND WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS COMMITTED TO FINDING A PATH FORWARD ON THIS WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO GET AN EXTENSION THAT MEETS FEDERAL APPROVAL WHAT WE WOULD DO WANNA MAKE SURE HOWEVER IS THAT WE DO NOT ALLOCATE AND COMMIT TO SPEND MONEY THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY SURE OF RECEIVING SO ONCE. WE GOT TO THAT PROCESS ONCE WE WORK WITH YOU TO BUILD THE BEST POSSIBLE CASE FOR APPROVAL AND THEN IF WE DO GET APPROVAL AND WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ALLOCATE THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM THAT. MCCARTY. THANK YOU I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT MR -- THEY SAID IT AND BEFORE I GET TO THE POLICY THE POLITICS THERE THAT -- WITHOUT THIS AND WITHOUT THE OTHER -- TAX CONFORMITY ISSUE NOT BEING ADDRESSED THERE'S NO THERE'S A HUGE HOLE IN THE STATE BUDGET AND THAT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AND DOWN YOU SAY -- THIS IS NOT A VIABLE WITH THE OTHER ONE BOTH HOUSES OF SAID HAVE QUESTIONED THE VIABILITY AS WELL SO -- I WOULD I WOULD THINK THANK AYE AYE AND I HAVE HEARD THE GOVERNOR SPEAK PUBLICLY AND OTHERS ABOUT THE THE ISSUE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MAN A WAIVER IS WE HAVE 2% AND IT'S A REALLY. DELICATE ISSUE ON A DAILY BASIS BUT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE I THINK YOU KNOW. MY NAME SAY KEVIN MCCARTHY WILL HAVE A BIG FAT VOICE IN THIS AS WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON OUR ON PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE HERE SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE AND I THINK THAT WE OUGHT. TO A PROCEED AS AS WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE IN THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CALLED YOUR NAME SAKE AND MR MAYES CALL THE PRESIDENT. AND JUST WORK IT OUT WE COULD ALL BE DONE HERE JUST GET ON THE PHONE GENTLEMAN L. ALEJO. I JUST ALL BUT THIS BOND QUICKLY DO A COUPLE OF POINTS WE WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT -- THAT ACTION BE TAKEN ON THIS ITEM DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS GIVEN THAT IT WOULD FACILITATE. AB BAM CEOS ARE HEALTH PLANS SETTING THEIR RATES AND BEING ABLE TO INCORPORATE ANY NEW STATE TAXES INTO THEIR RATES THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ON SETTING THEIR RATES THROUGH THE SUMMER MONTHS AND SO. A DELAY IN THE PROCESS IS GOING -- IN THE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RE AUTHORIZE TAX IS GOING. TO CREATE SOME SORT OF CONFLICT WITH THE TIME LINE FOR ESTABLISHING NEW NEW -- TAX RATES THERE ON ANOTHER FRONT AND NO AND NO DISCOURAGEMENT FROM THAT REACHING OUT TO MEMBERS. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS -- TO SOME DEGREE AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION -- THAT WOULD BE MADE BY THE THAT BY THIS ON A FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID -- THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE. YOU THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY TO THEM BUT THEY DO DEFINITELY POINT -- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- APPROVING ATTACKS THAT MEETS THE THE FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT ARE ENUMERATED IN THOSE REGULATIONS. WE THINK THAT THE TAX THAT WE'VE PUT FORWARD -- IS A IS A IS A POSSIBLE OPTION THAT DEFINITELY --% COULD COULD MEET FEDERAL APPROVAL GIVEN IT'S A PASSING OF CERTAIN STATISTICAL TESTS AND OTHER TESTS THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SO WOULD JUST -- WOULD JUST WANNA THAT NOTE THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT THERE IS THAT THERE ARE SORT OF SOMEWHAT STRICT FEDERAL RULES AROUND US THANK YOU. OF FINANCING THE FINAL WRAP UP ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. WELL CERTAINLY TEMPTING TO TRY TO CALL THIS ITEM WILL HOLD AN OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE A FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. AGAIN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ALEJO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RHYME WILL SEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THIS ISSUE RELATES TO THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE. FOR OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL. TO OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AGES NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE FEDERAL FUND COST OF SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S EXPANSION -- THE SENATE WENT FURTHER THAN THE GOVERNOR AND THE ASSEMBLY. APPROVING -- AND EXPANSION FOR THE NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE FOR A POPULATION -- AS WELL AS A SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER POPULATION AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GENERAL FUND COST OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ADDITIONALLY THE SENATE'S ACTION WOULD THERE AFTER INCREASE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY BY ONE YEAR OF AGE EACH CALENDAR YEAR BEGINNING WITH TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS. IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR OFFICES EVALUATED THE ON GOING GENERAL FUND COSTS -- OTHER RESPECTED HOUSES ACTIONS UNDER THE ASSEMBLY AND GOVERNOR SPENDING PLANS WE PROJECT THAT THE ON GOING GENERAL FUND COSTS WOULD BE. AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EXPANSION TO THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE POPULATION -- UNDER THE SENATE'S PLAN WE PROJECT THAT THE GENERAL FUND COSTS WOULD GROW -- EACH YEAR BY BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE SECOND. COMPONENT OF THIS ISSUE -- HAS NO -- FISCAL ISSUE IN CONFERENCE IT'S PURELY A LANGUAGE DIFFERENCE THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT -- IN LATER YEARS. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THEIR UNINSURED LOW INCOME POPULATIONS -- SOME COUNTIES ADMINISTER THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON THEIR OWN WHILE OTHERS -- IN THIRTY FIVE MOSTLY RURAL COUNTIES THIS RESPONSIBILITIES ADMINISTERED BY THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM -- WHICH IS OVERSEEN BY A GOVERNING BOARD -- EXPANSIONS IN MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY SUCH AS THE ONE BEING CONSIDERED -- TODAY AND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS IN THE PAST OF A MUCH LARGER. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND CREATE SAVINGS FOR COUNTIES IN COST FOR THE STATE. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS THE STATE CURRENTLY RE DIRECTS A PORTION OF REALIGNMENT REVENUES THAT GO TO COUNTIES TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. FOR THE UNINSURED TO THE STATE -- THAT REDIRECTION PERCENTAGE FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES IS CURRENTLY AT OF THEM DESPITE THIS REDIRECTION THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD HAS ACCUMULATED A SIGNIFICANT RESERVE. ESTIMATED TO BE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BY THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN TWENTY THE COULD SUSTAIN THE BOARD'S OPERATIONS FOR SO FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL NEW REVENUE. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED STOPPING THE FLOW OF ALL REALIGNMENT REVENUES. TO THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD UNTIL IT'S REVENUES ARE REDUCED. AND AFTER THAT POINT IT WOULD INCREASE THE REDIRECTION PERCENTAGE FROM 6275%. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT UNDER THE COMPLEX REALIGNMENT FUNDING RULES THIS INCREASE EVERY DIRECTION WOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CMS P. BOARD. WHICH MEANS THAT IN EFFECT -- THE INCREASE FOR DIRECTION WOULD REDIRECT ALL OF THE SAME AS P. BOARDS REVENUES -- EVEN AFTER ITS ITS RESERVES ARE REDUCED. BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY HAVE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO STOP THE FLOW OF REVENUES TO THE SCENE. BOARD -- BUT THE ASSEMBLY WENT FURTHER AND SPECIFIED THAT ONCE THE BOARD'S RESERVES HAVE BEEN REDUCED IT WOULD RECEIVE REVENUES -- AN OUTCOME THAT WE VIEW IS UNLIKELY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- INTERVIEW EITHER UNDER THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE ACTION. AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE WHAT THE ROLE OF SEEM AS P. SHOULD BE. GIVEN POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPANSIONS IN COVERAGE -- BUT AT THIS POINT AFTER THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR -- THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT -- AT THIS POINT. FINANCE ON THE GENERAL ISSUE OF EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE AT THE ADMINISTRATION STAYING WITH ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL OF EXPANSION FROM AGES. NINETEEN FOR TWENTY FIVE WE BELIEVE AT THIS TIME THAT EXPANSIONS BEYOND THOSE AGES WILL PUT ON GOING COST PRESSURES ON THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE'RE NOT SURE WE CAN SUSTAIN. AT THIS TIME. ON THE ISSUE OF CMS P. REDIRECTION I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE RIDE. AND BRAIN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS ON FRIDAY THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED REVISED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THAT ACTUALLY CHANGED -- THE REALIGNMENT REDIRECTION AMOUNT IN THE OUT YEARS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS CURRENT LAW LEVEL IN OTHER WORDS -- THE THE REVISED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NOW CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY ACTION -- WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. MEMBERS. NO QUESTIONS WILL BE THAT ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE NINE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATE AND WE'VE GOT A BLUE PAPER. AS OPPOSED TO WHITE PAPER. FROM LA -- AND SO THIS OUR HAND OUT ACTUALLY TOUCHES ON BOTH -- ITEMS -- ISSUED NINE AND TEN SO YOU'LL PRESENTABLE YET WE WILL PRESENT THEM BOTH SIGNED PHOTOS IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THAT PERFECT THANK YOU. A GREAT SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BACGROUND -- PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX OF TWENTY SIXTEEN RAISE TAXES ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND DEDICATES MOST OF THE REVENUE TO MEDI CAL -- CURRENTLY ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY GOES TO MEDIC COW -- AND IT'S GENERALLY BEEN USED TO THIS STATE FOR ONE OF TWO PURPOSES FIRST -- TO AUGMENT THE PROGRAM PRIMARILY BY INCREASING PROVIDER PAYMENTS IN MEDICARE AL OR TWO OFFSETTING GENERAL FUND COSTS OR A GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON COST GROWTH IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM -- TURNING THE PAGE -- TO WE NOTE -- IN IN OUR ESTIMATION SENATE ASSEMBLY PROPOSITION -- SPENDING PACKAGES ARE BROADLY SIMILAR -- BUT WITH SOME DIFFERENCES. FOR THE SIMILARITIES AND ALSO WITH THE GOVERNOR -- BOTH HOUSES WOULD CONTINUE EXISTING MEDI CAL PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES BUT ESTABLISH NEW SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS PROVIDE -- FOR FUNDING FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINING IN TRAUMA SCREENINGS -- AND AUGMENT THE MEDI CAL STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT IN ADDITION BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SEEK THREE YEAR -- FEDERAL APPROVAL OF THE PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT PRACTICE IN WHICH DH CS REQUEST ANNUAL APPROVAL. NEXT THE AND SO THE FIGURE ON THIS ON PAGE TWO DOES SUMMARIZE THE OVERALL PACKAGES BUT I'LL HIGHLIGHT THE DIFFERENCES HERE BELOW. SO STARTING WITH THE FIRST DIFFERENCE ON ON PAGE. THREE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A IN THE MAY REVISION -- SUN SETTING ALL PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX POLICY AUGMENTATIONS IN MEDI CAL AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ASSEMBLY. APPROVED THESE SUNSETS IN ITS BUDGET PACKAGE -- AND SO UNDER BOTH THE THE ASSEMBLY AND GOVERNOR'S PLAN -- INSTEAD OF FUNDING SAY NEW PROVIDER PAYMENTS OR OTHER AUGMENTATIONS TRIP PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON COST GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. THE SENATE HOWEVER TOOK ACTION TO REJECT THESE SUNSETS. NUMBER TWO THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE PROVIDED A DIFFERENT LEVELS FOR THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED -- ESTABLISHING THIS PROGRAM -- IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ALLOCATES -- AND UNDER HIS PROPOSAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OR UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS -- WHILE THE SENATE APPROVED THE FUNDING AS PROPOSED THE ASSEMBLY TOOK ACTION TO REDUCED. ANNUAL FUNDIN FOR THE PROGRAM BY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THREE THE THE ASSEMBLY USES THE FREED UP MONEY -- FROM REDUCING FUNDING FOR THE VALUE BASS PAYMENTS TO INSTEAD FUND AN ASSORTMENT OF PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES THAT ARE LISTED. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. THREE FOUR THE ASSEMBLY -- ON PAGE FOUR ON PAGE -- FOUR THE SOURCE FOR THE OPTICAL BENEFIT RESTORATION SO THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSE RESTORING THE OPTICAL BENEFIT PURSUANT TO A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD USE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING TO DO SO -- THE SENATE APPROVED THIS ACT THIS PROPOSAL WELL THE ASSEMBLY WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE OPTICAL BENEFITS ARE ALSO RESTORE THE OPTICAL BENEFIT BUT WOULD DO SO USING GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. FIVE THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED -- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REGARDING UNSPENT FUNDING -- PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING SO SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING FLOWS THROUGH MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS -- BEFORE ULTIMATELY REACHING PROVIDERS ASSEMBLY -- PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD INSURER THAT ANNIE'S FUNDING THAT ULTIMATE THAT GOES TO MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT DOES NOT ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY MAKE IT TO PROVIDERS IS INSTEAD REVERTED TO THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUND. AND COULD BE SPENT ON OTHER -- ANOTHER -- ORTIZ AND THEN FINALLY THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THAT WOULD EXTEND THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM TO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS REFUGE SEES WOULD NOT RECEIVE -- OF FUNDING THROUGH THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM THEY ARE -- THEY ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY IN MEDI CAL AND THE ASSEMBLY -- HAS PROPOSED TO EXTEND THESE PAYMENTS TO THEM -- JUST TO PROVIDE THAT NOW SOME -- ARE LA -- COMMENTS SO WE SENT OUT -- TO OUR ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION RECENTLY AND FIRST WE'D WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED SUNSETS FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SPENDING -- IN LINE WITH THE SENATE'S ACTION WHILE WE DO THINK TE THE OVERALL -- PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SHOULD BE REEVALUATED TO REALLY UNDER BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS WE DO NOT THINK THAT -- SUN SETTING THEM FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT REASONS -- IS A IS A IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF FUND -- OF THE OF THE FUND AND THEN SECONDLY WE HAVE A WE HAVE -- PUT OUT -- SOME COMMENTS ON THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM AND QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A A COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IN LIGHT OF SOME PARALLEL EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING PURSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO REALLY INCREASE QUALITY OF CARE. AND SO CONCEPTUALLY WE DO -- WE WE LIKE THAT SOMEBODY'S APPROACH OF REDUCING FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM AND DO LIKE THE IDEA OF TARGETING FUNDING INCREASES FOR PROVIDERS WITHIN THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM. AS THE ASSEMBLY HAS SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE WILL MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST YEAR MINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PLACE A PRIORITY ON THE VALUE BASED PROGRAMS AND WE BELIEVE THAT PROGRAMS DOES HAVE VALUE OF COURSE UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PROPOSAL. THERE IS A HUGE SHARE OF MONEY GOING TO INCREASING PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE CONSISTENT WITH THAT THAT WE SHOULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET MORE AND BETTER. HEALTH. BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS FOR WHAT WE ARE PAYING SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS A THE ADMITTED THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED RE DIRECTING SHOULD CONTINUE TO STAY IN THAT PROGRAM. THE SECOND POINT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR VALUE BASED PAYMENTS FOR FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS -- THOSE ARE ALREADY THIS PAYMENTS ARE CRIER RECEIVED UNDER PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT RATE SYSTEM WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PAYMENTS THAT. OFTEN OTHERWISE UNDER MEDI CAL AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM IS SUFFICIENT WHERE WE DO NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO INCLUDE THOSE WITH THE REST OF THE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT'S UNNECESSARY AND THAT MONEY CAN. BETTER BE USED TO THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING RIGHT NOW AND FINALLY ON THE THIRD POINT THE SUN SETS WE DISCUSS THAT ONCE I KNOW LAST THURSDAY. SO NOT MUCH TO ADD ON THAT EXCEPT TO SAY THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- DIFFERENT POLICY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE MULTI YEAR GENERAL FUND FORECAST AND THE FACT THAT FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX IN PARTICULAR. THIS IS LIKELY DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE THERE ARE SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER MOORE Là. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. DID SOMEONE JUST TO FIND FOR ME VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM. I'M NOT FINDING IT NEARLY -- REPORTS ARE JUST. WELCOME AND AGAINST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE IDEA BEHIND VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM IS TO PAY PROVIDERS AN INCENTIVE -- FOR IMPROVING AND IDENTIFIED METRICS SO -- BEHAVIOR HEALTH INTEGRATION PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT QUALITY AND QUALITY AND OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SO WE WOULD BE PAYING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS IF PROVIDERS -- MEET -- INCREASE TARGETS. THANK YOU AND I'M FROM FURIOUS. DOES PROP FIFTY SIX HAVE THE ABILITY. TO HAVE A SUNSET. ARE WE DOING THIS BASED ON A LEGAL OPINION OR SO BASICALLY DOES -- FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATE THE GOVERNOR'S MADE A PROPOSAL AND ARE APPROPRIATED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS EVERY YEAR. SO THE GOVERNOR CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS WITH REGARDS TO MEDICARE ALL BUT WITH THE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S AND ACTING IT'S FOR THAT TO THE BUDGET PROBLEM THANKS YES -- AND THEN WHEN I DON'T SEE HERE IS IS A TREND. OUR PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES DOING OR THE DECLINING. ARE THE LEVEL OF THE RISING. SO ARE ONLY IN THE SECOND YEAR OF REVENUES AND COMPARED TO THE FIRST YEAR WE DID HAVE A QUARTER OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THEY ARE DECREASING SLIGHTLY [inaudible] BY [inaudible] 5%. I CAN OUT WE HAVE OUR OWN PROJECTIONS I DON'T KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS PROJECTIONS BUT WE WE HAVE A GROUP VERY GRADUAL DECLINE OF ABOUT 2%. ANNUALLY IN THIS FUND A LARGE PART THE THE DECLINE IS IS SO SMALL BECAUSE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX EXTENDED THE TAX. TO NON CIGARETE SUCH AS EASY CIGARETTES AND SO FORTH RUN INCLUDES VAPING AND OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. FOR THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE WELCOME A SCANNER. THANK YOU -- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT OUTSIDE THE THE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. HAVE HAD THEIR RATES ROZEN SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE AND OUR PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES HAVE HAD THEIR RATES FROZEN SINCE -- SEVEN AWAIT AND WITH THE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM BOTH WHAT YOU ALL DISCUSSED IN WHAT IS IN OUR MATERIALS IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ABILITY TO ADDRESS THAT THOSE FROZEN RATES. THAT IS CORRECT AND I DIED ONLY TWO THINGS I WOULD KNOW DESERT -- INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DRESS TELL ME DISABLED CURRENTLY DO RECEIVE SOME PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX FUNDING FOR OUR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT SO IT'S NOT A RATE INCREASE BUT IT'S AT AN INCREASE -- FOR THOSE PAYMENTS AND THAT WOULD BE CONTINUED UNDER BOTH HOUSES -- ACTIONS THE STANDALONE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES DID RECEIVE A ONE TIME -- INCREASE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT LAST YEAR OR PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASE -- BUT THAT WAS NOT -- THAT CARRIED FORWARD TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. WE WILL MOVE ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YEAH. ISSUE. ELEVEN RELATES -- TO OPTIONAL BENEFITS A MEDI CAL THAT WERE ELIMINATED DURING THE LAST RECESSION -- AS WAS NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS ITEMS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED RESTORING OPTICAL BENEFITS USING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING -- THE SENATE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR OPTICAL BENEFITS -- AND ADDITIONALLY APPROVED SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS TO ALSO RESTORE -- SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONAL BENEFITS THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN RESTORED INCLUDING AUDIOLOGY INCONTINENCE CREAMS AND WASHES PODIATRY AND SPEECH THERAPY. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE RESTORATION OF ALL OF THE SAME BENEFITS BUT ALSO APPROVED FUNDING FOR CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES -- BUT AS WAS IMMINENT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY FUNDS THE OPTICAL BENEFITS USING THE GENERAL FUND SO HAS A HIGHER GENERAL FUND COST OF EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND A TOTAL FROM COSTA THIRTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. HOLD THE SOAP I AM OPEN THANK YOU -- NINETY ISSUE TWELVE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE HOUSING SERVICES. BELIAU BUT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED -- ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR TWENTY NINETEEN THE FUND -- SUPPORT OF HOUSING SERVICES -- IN WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT COUNTIES THE SENATE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUESTED FUNDING -- FOR BUT ALSO ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO WORK WITH COUNTIES ON THE ALLOCATE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY TO TARGET THE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE -- FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THAT ARE HOMELESS AND TO INSURE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE FUNDING IS USED. SO THE ISSUE HERE BEFORE YOU IS -- THIS EXTRA TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE APPROVED BY THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU AW I UNDERSTAND THE THE ADMINISTRATION -- HAS AGREED TO COMPROMISE LANGUAGE. OKAY IF YOU LIKE TO SHARE THAT WITH IS THAT BE GREAT -- YES WELL OF AMENDED HIS APARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE A COMPROMISE WOULD BE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE -- TO ARE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS ISSUE AND WILL SHARE WITH YOU ALL [inaudible] GREAT. SO COLLEAGUES THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT WE COULD TAKE A VOTE ON ON TERROR AND THAT LANGUAGE IS BEING DISTRIBUTED NOW. WILL TAKE A MINUTE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- WITH REGARD TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM OR SUCCESS A PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OF HOUSING SERVICES THE NEW LANGUAGE SAYS BUT INCLUDED IS AS FOLLOWS QUOTE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RENTAL SUBSIDIES. THAT'S THE NEW LINE THAT WAS ADDED TO THE LANGUAGE THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION PREVIOUSLY. AND TO CLARIFY THAT LANUAGE WAS ADDED TO SOLVE WHAT PROBLEM. THE ABILITY TO USE -- THE FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES OKAY. A FEW PEOPLE TODAY TEND NOT READY -- MORLOCK [inaudible] MINIATURE -- I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND. HOW THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS? DONE AS IT RELATES TO SAY POPULATION FOR ENTIRE COUNTY. ORANGE COUNTY HAS THREE POINT ONE MILLION. SACRAMENTO HAS WE REQUESTED HALF THAT ONE POINT. FIVE BUT IT HAS GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY SO I'M JUST KIND OF JUST CURIOUS IF MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN. HOW THAT WORKS? AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE USE A TWENTY SEVENTEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT TO DETERMINE A COMPONENT OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS. CANINO WHAT POINT TIME IS I'VE DONE IT -- OKAY I'M AB. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN JUST GIVE -- FOLKS Là MORE TIME TO DIGEST THE LANGUAGE IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU FOR MORE LUCK WITH THAT THE HELPFUL. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND REMEMBER THAT. FULL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. WHEN ON THE ISSUE THIRTEEN NON WHOLE PERSON CARE COUNTIES FUNDING THAT'S INTERESTING NON HOLD? FOR CARE COUNTIES FUNDING ALEJO -- SO THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FOR COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE -- PILOTS IN THIS WOULD BE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CARRIED OUT IN COUNTIES THAT DO HAVE WHOLE PERSON CARE. PILOTS SUCH AS COORDINATING HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. FOR INDIVIDUALS TO UTILIZE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THE SENATE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUESTED FUNDING. FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUESTED FUNDING BUT USE GENERAL FUND RATHER THAN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND -- SO THE DIFFERENCE TODAY IS BETWEEN -- WHICH FUND SOURCES USED TO TO FUND THIS AUGMENTATION GENERAL FUND FOR THE ASSEMBLY AND MENTAL SERVICES FUND FOR THE SENATE. THANK YOU FINANCE WE BELIEVE THIS EXPANSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT AND PURPOSES OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTON SAID THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE FUNDING. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. THREE NONE MOVING THE ISSUE FOURTEEN STRENGTHENING FISCAL ESTIMATES IN CASH FLOW MONITORING DELEO. THIS ISSUE -- RELATES TO A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS IN TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ACCOMPLISH A VARIETY OF TASKS -- RELATED TO FISCAL -- OVERSIGHT -- FIRST TO THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE MONITORING OF CASH FLOWS AND THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SECOND THEY WOULD INCREASE THE RECONCILIATION OF ACTUAL SPENDING TO BUDGET ESTIMATES THIRD THEY WOULD IMPROVE THE PROCESSING OF PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS. AND FINALLY THEY WOULD INCREASE COORDINATION AMONG ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS AT THE DEPARTMENT -- THIS PROPOSAL IS CONNECTED -- TO RECENT -- LARGE AND MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS IN IN THE MEDI CAL BUDGET THAT -- HAVE BECAUSE SOME CHALLENGES FOR ON THE LEGISLATURE'S -- BUDGETING AND AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROGRAM. THE SENATE APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ADDITIONALLY ENACTED PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES ON ACTUAL CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO ESTIMATES -- ALSO TO PREPARE AND PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE A PLAN WITH LONGER TERM CHANGES TO ADDRESS -- ISSUES IN IN THIS REGARD AND FINALLY -- TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO INITIATE -- A WORKING GROUP WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND OUR OFFICE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CHANGES. AND THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE ACTION AS IT ALIGNS WITH OUR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED FISCAL ESTIMATES AN INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ALTERNATE OVER MY COLLEAGUE RIGHT -- SO I I THINK FIRST WERE WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT THE SENATE HAD SUPPORTED OUR A PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA -- I ACTUALLY BROUGHT ALONG WITH ME -- PAGE FROM THE LA OWES ANALYSIS OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET IN WHICH THEY HAD A TEXT BOX. LOOKING AT KIND OF SOME OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF MEDI CAL VOLATILITY -- ESTIMATE VOLATILITY -- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS HAS CAUSED -- FOR IT FOR GENERAL FUND PLANNING. HI WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE SHARE THOSE FRUSTRATIONS BECAUSE IT ALSO IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO PLAN -- FOR GENERAL FUND BUDGETING -- BUT BRIEFLY ON THE ALLEY AS TEXT BOX HERE -- THEY THEY MENTION THREE DIFFERENT THINGS -- MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS -- WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE RATES THAT ARE APPROVED EACH YEAR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TIMING OF THOSE RATES BECAUSE THE MEDI CAL BUDGET IS ON A CASH BASIS -- THE TIMING OF THOSE APPROVALS IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE OFF -- THE NUMBER TWO ONE THAT THEY POINTED OUT WAS THE QUALITY ISSUE THE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE BE -- WHICH PROVIDES AN OVER ONE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BENEFIT EVERY YEAR. AND THE THIRD -- DRUG REBATES WE GET SAVINGS FROM. FROM DRUG REBATES THAT ARE -- NEGOTIATED WITH MANUFACTURERS -- I WANTED TO POINT THESE OUT BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE OUR REVENUE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHERE WE LOOKED AT WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS WE HAD TO ADDRESS REVENUE VOLATILITY. I THINK WE HAVE A SIMILAR DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT -- HOW TO ADDRESS MEDI CAL VOLATILITY IN AND IN EACH OF THESE CASES? PRINCIPALLY THINGS LIKE THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEES -- THERE ARE STRONG POLICY REASONS WHY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET RIDOF THESE MECHANISMS THEY PROVIDED GENERAL FUND BENEFIT IN SOME CASES THEY PROVIDE PROVIDER BENEFITS THEY MADE IT IN AND IN MANY CASES THEY ALSO -- INCENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE INSTEAD MANAGE THAT MEDI CAL VOLATILITY. WE HAD TO PROPOSALS THIS YEAR THE FIRST A COVER VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE BOTH HOUSES APPROVED IT -- WE CREATED A SPECIAL FUND IN WHICH TO DEPOSIT DRUG REBATE -- SAVINGS -- AND THE CONCEPT WAS KIND OF LIKE PROPOSITION TWO THAT WITH PROPOSITION TWO YOU TAKE OFF SPIKES IN CAPITAL GAINS REVENUES TO TRY TO SMOOTH OUT GENERAL FUND SPENDING -- LIKEWISE WHEN WHEN DRUG REBATE SAVINGS EXCEED OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WE PLAN TO DEPOSIT SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS INTO THE SPECIAL FUND AND USE THEM FOR WHEN WE ACTUALLY UNDERESTIMATE OUR SAVINGS TO TRY TO SMOOTH OUT THE EFFECT. OF THOSE REBATES ON THE GENERAL FUND AND THE SECOND IS THIS PROPOSAL -- WHICH I THINK -- HAS A FEW DIFFERENT PURPOSES ONE IS -- WHAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE THE MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS THAT I MENTIONED -- MANY OF THESE -- CALL THE FEES AND OTHER ENHANCEMENTS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE VERY COMPLEX -- AND THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS -- THE TIMING OF OF SETTLING UP -- FOR DIFFERENT -- ITEMS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THIS IS ON A CASH BASIS AND IT WOULD CST I BELIEVE OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PUT IT ON THE CRUEL BASIS. YOU KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PRIORITIZE THAT -- WE WE WANTED TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS BY -- ON THE ONE HAND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL CAPACITY AND WITH RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT -- SO WE WILL BE BETTER ANALYZING AYE TRANSACTIONS IN CASH TRENDS -- AND ALSO IMPROVING GIVING RESOURCES TO THE FISCAL FORECASTING DIVISION TO IMPROVE -- THEIR MODELING EFFORTS THERE NUMBER -- TWO WE'RE GONNA BE INCREASED IMPROVING COORDINATION BETWEEN UNITS OF FOR EXAMPLE THESE MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS THERE FOR DIFFERENT DIVISIONS THAT WORK ON THESE. THAT WORK ON THESE PAYMENTS IN ORDER TO GET A PAYMENT OUT TE DOOR AND THESE PAYMENTS CAN BE YOU KNOW A FEW BILLION DOLLARS. APIECE AND SO WE WANT TO GET RESOURCES ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT TO BETTER COORDINATE AND TRACK THESE THINGS IN THE CENTURY JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER BETTER. AND LASTLY WE WANT TO CENTRALIZE FISCAL LEADERSHIP IN A CFO POSITION A NEW POSITION A DH CS. WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SORT OF SEE THE BIG PICTURE -- IN IN -- IN THE FISCAL SITUATION AND SO JUST TO CLOSE YOU KNOW WE WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF CONTINUING. TO TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT THAT THE BALLOT CAL ESTIMATE IS HAVING ON THE GENERAL FUND -- WITH BAD WERE HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS -- WE WE REJECT THE ITEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET DONE REALLY A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ABOUT THE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS WERE GONNA DO I DON'T THINK YOU. GIVE THE PROPER CONTEXT OF THE SITUATION AND THE REASON. WE ENDED UP REJECTING THOSE POSITIONS IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND IN WITH THE P.. NAT SHORTFALL THAT WAS. HER PRETTY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUDGET. BECAUSE OF WHAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED SO I THINK WE WE ALL AGREE THAT. THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE WE ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS -- I CHALLENGE AND AND I'M I'M PERSON VERY SUPPORT FOR WHATEVER WE COULD DO. TO HAVE BETTER ESTIMATES -- I THINK WHEN WE DRILL DOWN ON THE ISSUE WITH IT WE GET SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO WHAT THE TWENTY FIVE NEW PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE DOING SO PERHAPS YOU CAN GO TO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THAT. SO IN ADDITION TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID -- WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS -- ADDING POSITIONS TO CRITICAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT -- ACCOUNTING FISCAL FORECAST DEAN MANAGED CARE -- THIRD PARTY LIABILITY DIVISION TO BETTER COORDINATE COMMUNICATE TRACK -- REPORT -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT A SPECIFIC DIVISION OR TO THIS INCIDENT. THIS IS A DEPARTMENT THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN SOMEONE ANTAGONISTIC TOWARD LEGISLATURE -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEAD THAT HAS A SORT OF A HISTORY OF ANTAGONISM THERE ARE SUB COMMITTEE SO. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW ON WHICH WHICH POSITIONS WHICH AREAS BUT THEY BE DOING I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF NORMALLY WE WOULD NOT BE DOING THAT A CONFERENCE THAT WAS WHAT WE REALLY WHAT WAS. TO ROB QUESTIONS SUBCOMMITTEE WASN'T GIVEN FOR THE PURCHASE BY WE REJECTED. I REQUEST YEAH AND SO -- I CAN GO DIVISION BY DIVISION -- SO AND MINISTRY OF DIVISION FOR POSITIONS --TO CENTRALIZE ACCOUNTING RESPONSIBILITIES AND ASSISTING WITH RECONCILING CASH BALANCES WITH PROJECTED A NET ENACT ACTUAL EXPENDITURES -- THE CAPITATED RATES DEVELOPMENT DIVISIONS TO POSITIONS -- COMPILING A PROVIDING MONTHLY MANAGED CARE PAYMENT RATE -- UPDATES -- RESEARCH DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROJECTED AN ACTUAL EXPENDITURES FOR MANAGED CARE FOR THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM -- THIS THE CFO POSITION MY COLLEAGUE DISCUSSED -- AND THE FISCAL FORECASTING DIVISION TEN POSITIONS -- TO COMPARE AND RESEARCH ESTIMATED VERSES A CRUEL EXPENDITURES -- DEVELOP FISCAL ESTIMATES TRACK IMPLEMENTATION OF EXPENDITURES -- THE SCENE. A INFORMATION MANAGEMENT DIVISION TWO POSITIONS -- THIS IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT -- CHANGE REQUESTS NECESSARY -- TO EXECUTE THE MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS WHICH AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ARE CAN BE ABOVE ONE BILLION DOLLARS -- MANAGED CARE OPERATIONS DIVISION SO THAT'S TWO POSITIONS -- OVERSEE -- PROJECT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE MAN THE MEDIC MEDICAI MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. THE PHARMACY BENEFITS DIVISION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE VOLATILITY MY COLLEAGUE -- NOTED ON THE DRUG REBATES TO COME BACK TO THE PREVIOUS ISSUE WHEN YOU IDENTIFIED -- REALLY THE THE SHORTCOMING WHAT -- WHAT SHORTCOMINGS IN PARTICULAR ARE ARE THESE POSITIONS -- DEALING WITH. SO I I MEAN I THINK AGAIN LIKE. WE ARE WE'RE DEALING WITH THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF RATE CHANGES A YEAR. HE OF BENEFITS FOR OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE THAT THE ESTIMATE ITSELF IS OVER A THOUSAND PAGES AYE. KLAY PRETTY UNWIELDY AND IN ORDER FOR IN ORDER FOR ALL OF THIS. TO TO BECOME AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE ON A CASH BASIS IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE SEVERAL DIVISIONS A DH CS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS HAVE TO BE TALKING WITH ENOUGH IT'S EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TO BE -- TRACKING THESE THINGS AND AND RESEARCHING THAT'S WHAT THIS IS WHAT ALL THESE POSITIONS ARE ABOUT RESEARCHING -- YOU KNOW CHANGES IN LAW -- WHAT WE AMONG THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- OFFERS CHANGES IN -- GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS THEY HAVE TO BE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACT IS -- ON THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE -- REALLY -- I THINK AGAIN IT KIND OF  HIGHER LEVEL -- TEN OF THE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS WOULD BE. FOR ESSENTIALLY IMPROVING THE ESTIMATE ITSELF. AND THE BULK OF THE REST OF THEM I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE -- FOR COORDINATING BETTER -- FOR TRYING TO TRACK ALL OF THIS COMPLEXITY BETTER. IT SOUNDS LIKE HALF THE POSITIONS ARE. TO ASSIST WITH TEST. ANALYZING AND COMBING THROUGH THE DATA. CORRECT AND THEN SOUNDS LIKE THE OTHER HALF IS. TO SORT OF IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS. YEAH AND AND AND THE VISION YOU KNOW BOTH FROM LIKE AN ACCOUNTING LEVEL AND AT A BUDGETING LEVEL AND THEN YOU HAVE -- FOLKS A DH CS WHO WORK ON THE ESTIMATE ITSELF THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS CAN I TRY TO HELP GET THEM ON THE SAME PAGE. WHERE THE ARMY THE CHALLENGES IN PREVIOUS YEARS JUST THE? THE IS JUST SORT OF BEING OVERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF DATA. OR WAS IT ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUE BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. ANALYZING DAMAGE IN ITS NOT NECESSARILY HUMAN BEINGS WHO DO IT IT'S NOW. COMPUTERS WHO AND THE TWO THINGS ARE NOT THERE'S A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION THAT. COULD ASSIST WITH THAT OR WAS IT I'M REALLY BECAUSE IN A TO THE DIFFERENT SILOS WAR. COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TURN OVER TO A COLLEAGUE OF HER. AROUND FOR MORE OF THOSE -- ESTHER. HI ADAM DIVERSITY BERMAN FINANCE SO -- THERE'S BEEN A FEWISSUES OVER THE YEARS AN EGG AND AND PRIMARILY WHAT MY COLLEAGUE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITIES. LED TO SOME ISSUES THAT RESULTED IN YOU KNOW DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATE. THE MOST NOTABLE ONE WAS AROUND THE CORNER TO CARE INITIATIVE ESTIMATE TWO YEARS AGO AND LARGELY WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE IS ACCOUNTING FOR MONEY BETWEEN THESE THIS KIND OF MANAGED CARE BASED PROGRAM. WHERE WE TALK ABOUT ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF RATES THAT TO BE DONE? AND TRANSLATING THAT INTO THAT KIND OF THE LANGUAGE BETWEEN THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE USED FOR BUILDING THE ESTIMATE AND THE BUILDING THE RATES PAID THE PLANS. AND BASICALLY THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T SYNC UP AND THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS TO DO THESE THINGS IN A VAULT. I'M TOGETHER KIND OF SEPARATELY -- TO DO THAT KIND OF TRANSLATION THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT THAT YOU KNOW ARE ARE SO PROBLEMATIC IN A IN A PROGRAM THIS COMPLEX. AND SO -- AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THAT'S WHERE THE BUDGETING ISSUES A BAND AND THAT'S WHAT THE THE REQUEST IS DESIGNED TO TEACH TO ADDRESS. CAN YOU FEEL GIVEN THE LEADERSHIP'S THAT'S IN PLACE. THAT THERE IS ENOUGH -- MANAGERIAL COMPETENCY. TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE TWENTY I MEAN BECAUSE PART OF IT IS AND JUST. HAVING THE BODIES IS SO SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE THE SYMPHONY CONDUCTOR FOR LACK OF BETTER ANALOGY -- BIT HERE DO YOU HAVE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM IN PLACE AND KNOWS HOW TO BRING THESE PEOPLE ON IT. HI GET THEM IN PLACEAND THAT TAXI MANAGE THIS PROCESS GOOD COMMUTERS TENNIS COMPLEX AND OBVIOUSLY -- WE WE WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT WE DO NEED TO GO ADDRESSED US. YES SO THAT'S AGAIN PART OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING T ADDRESS BY CREATING A CFO POSITION AND SO THE YOU'LL HAVE SOMEONE IS GONNA BE A POINT PERSON THAT CAN HELP KIND OF BRIDGE -- SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. OKAY. AND IT DOES LOOK AGAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON YOUR WORK -- WE WE REJECTED BECAUSE WE OR WE WHAT WE HAVE SAID WE GOT ADEQUATE INFORMATION SO IF YOU DO THAT ADDITIONAL PERMISSION TO PROVIDE. TO OUR OUR BUT TO START TO BE GREAT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE. FIFTEEN COLLEAGUES I'M GONNA SUGGESTIONS -- OF FOOD HAS ARRIVED WE'RE GONNA TAKE ISSUE FIFTEEN IT'S THE LAST ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THE REST ARE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME FROM. THE LEGISLATIVE SO I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE BREAK -- AB FIFTEEN ON THE WILL TAKE ONE MORE ACTION BEFORE WE BREAK -- IT. ALL RIGHT -- ISSUE FIFTY MANAGE CARE SANCTIONS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ELIO -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY A AND EXPAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AT THE READY TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON MANAGED CARE PLANS MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PLANS THAT ARE. FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE STATE'S CONTRACTS OR OTHER RULES THE SENATE ADOPTED THE PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE AS THE LANGUAGE WAS UNAVAILABLE -- SO AT CONRAD THEY CONFERENCE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THIS LANGUAGE THE TRAILER BILL WAS RELEASED ON FRIDAY -- THIS PAST FRIDAY -- WE'VE GIVING IT A PRELIMINARY REVIEW -- BUT HAVEN'T HAD IT REALLY IT SIGNIFICANT TIME. TO FULLY RENT COMPREHENSIVELY REVIEW THE LANGUAGE. WE DO AGREE WITH THE GENERAL INTENT BEHIND THE LANGUAGE BUT DO HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT -- MANY OF THE SPECIFICS AND ABOUT SOME OF THE BREADTH OF A STORY THAT IT WOULD ULTIMATELY GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO STAND BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL AS LA -- MENTIONED WE KNOW THE LANGUAGE WAS JUST RELEASED ON FRIDAY SO WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. MEMBERS [inaudible] SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NOW THE AT THE GOT THIS THE OTHER DAY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE SEEN THIS. RIGHT NOW. THEY CONFESSED THAT THEY GOT IT OUT ON FRIDAY [inaudible] THEN THE WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO TRULY EVALUATE AND THE REASON THAT I AM CONCERNED AT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY VERY PUNITIVE SECTION. THE RECTOR MY IDENTIFY FINDINGS NON COMPLIANCE OR GOOD CAUSE THROUGH ANY MEANS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A WHOLE SERIES OF POINTS HERE -- TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY SUSPEND ENROLLMENT THE THE THIS THIS IS A VERY PUNITIVE. DOCUMENT AND DIED I DO BELIEVE THAT. TO IT IT IS DUE THE JUSTICE OF SOME VERY DEEP SCRUTINY AND SO LET'S NOT MOVE ON THIS TONIGHT AT LEAST. ABSOLUTELY SIR THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM OTHERS. VISITING TO JUST A QUICK QUESTION WHICH IS WHERE WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE COMING OUT SO LATE ON FRIDAY WAS THERE. IS THERE A RUSH TO IMPLEMENT THIS I KNOW THAT STAKEHOLDERS OF NOW START COMING OUT AND HAVE RAISED SOME CONCERNS BUT JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY. FOR MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED WE ARE STILL STANDING BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL AM SO GIVEN RECENT -- PERFORMANCE OR LACK PERFORMANCE OF FROM OUR MANAGED HEALTHCARE PLANS WE THINK THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WE SHOULD -- MOVE FORWARD WITH. NOW I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT -- WITHIN -- WELFARE IT'S HIS INSTITUTIONS CODE THERE IS AUTHORITY FOR THE DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SANCTION PLANS AND TO HAVE OTHER SORT OF PUNITIVE% ACTIONS IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING WITH CONTRACTS OR STATE RULES AND SO FORTH. THIS DOES INCREASE AUTHORITY IN LINE WITH IN LINE WITH THE INTENT AND WE DON'T SEE CHALLENGES THERE BUT THERE IS EXISTING AUTHORITY -- TO SANCTION OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST MANAGED CARE PLANS OUT OF COMPLIANCE CURRENTLY AND I'M SORRY IF I MISSED IT HAS THERE BEEN A SITUATION BECAUSE I AS I THINK I RECALL I BELIEVE SANCTIONS HAVING BEEN LEVIED. ALL IN THE PAST -- THEIR PARTICULAR -- A THE LAW THAT'S VAGUE OR A SCENARIO THAT. ON THEDEPARTMENT IS ENCOUNTERED WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY THEY NEEDED TO TAKE. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PROTECT. PUBLIC RESOURCES AND CALIFORNIANS [inaudible] YEAH. WELL OF AMENDED ITS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THIS INCREASED INCREASES A SANCTION AMOUNT AND EIGHTY CLARIFIES -- AND APPLIES AUTHORITY TO ALL OF THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUSIVE OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED BEFORE. THAT IS MY UNDER IN THE DIRECT AS A STORY OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THIRTY NIELSEN. FOLLOW UP ON IT A LITTLE BIT NOW WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS EVERY YEAR. FOR MANY YEARS. AND NOW SOMETHING THAT APPEARS. THE LITTLE BETTER ABOVE THE BAR THE NORM IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY THAT YOU'RE BEING ACCORDED EVEN THOUGH YOU MAYBE HAVE SOME STATUTORY AUTHORITY THIS LOOKS LIKE IT GREATLY EXPANDS THAT IT'S ALREADY. AND GREATLY EXPANDS THE PUNITIVE ABILITY OF THE AGENCY NOW. AGAIN THE JURASSIC Là BIT OF QUESTION IS SOMETHING PERPETRATED THIS IS A BEEN SOME KIND OF A GREAT DMV DISASTER HERE THAT HAS OCCURRED THAT -- THAT WARRANTS THESE KINDS OF THE PENALTIES I WON'T EVEN USE AN ADJECTIVE THAT. ONE OF THE CONCERNS -- THIS IS A PROPOSAL REACTING -- TO AGAIN -- LACK OF PERFORMANCE FROM OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS -- IN PARTICULAR THE REASON I ADDED ON THE LACK OF SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO CHILDREN -- SO THE IDEA CAME OUT AND AND MARCH AND SO THIS IS A RESPONSE IN TRYING TO IMPROVE -- UP PERFORMANCE IN THIS AREA GOT IT. WELL IT DID NOT COMPLETE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED BUT IT IS AN ANSWER AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY AT THIS. THAT WAS HELPFUL TO HEAR THAT IT SAID IT WAS AN AUDIT FINDING IN THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO AN AUDIT. FINDING THAT THAT WAS HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GOOD EVENING MR BIGELOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT MAYBE YOU COULD EXPAND ON A SENATOR NELSON'S. QUESTION THERE -- DURING THAT AUDIT THAT WAS DISCOVERED. THAT WHERE THERE WAS -- SOME ISSUES WITH MENTAL HEALTH WHERE WAS THE DOWNFALLS. WHAT WAS COPPER TRADING THAT AND WAS THERE CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT COULD HAVE SORTED THAT EFFORT IF IT HAD BEEN? VIEWED BY OTHERS IN A MORE TIMELY WAY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE EXTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR TODAY. I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND PREPARE A RESPONSE TO YOUR YOUR QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL CURRENT. SOME OF THAT MIGHT BEAR ERIT FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS ITEM SO THAT WE CAN GET A MORE DEFINED. DETAILED ANSWER. THANK YOU DONE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. WELL LET'S GO BACK COLLEAGUES TO ISSUE. FOR THE FOURTEEN FORTY ONE WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO ISSUE SIXTEEN AND EVERYONE HAS SEEN THE COMPROMISE LANGUAGE AND SO ALL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO ACCEPT THE CONFERENCE COMPROMISE. THANK YOU IT IS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED [inaudible] THANK YOU. WITH A VOTE A FOR YOUR GIPSON. FOUR FOUR FOUR ONE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. FIVE ZERO ON THE SENATE SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT FILE ITEM IS CLOSED. COLLEAGUES WERE GONNA DO. A COUPLE OF MORE [inaudible] ITEMS. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO A COUPLE MORE ITEMS? IF WE COULD GO ON TO ITEM. SIXTEEN ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER EXPANSION UNDER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER ALLOWS UNLIMITED NUMBER OF MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MORE COSTLY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVERS CURRENTLY WOMEN TO YOU COUNTIES. THE GOVERNOR MADE NO PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE IN THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION IN THIS AREA. THE SENATE TOOK ACTION TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO INCREASE ALE W. SLOTS BY -- FIVE THOUSAND IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY WITH ADDITIONAL INCREASES -- IN FOLLOWING YEARS IN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE SENATE ACTION REDUCES SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BY TWENTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO REFLECT THAT SAVINGS RELATED TO THIS ACTION -- IN LIGHT OF THE STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT EXPANDING THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER WOULD RESULT IN SOME STATES SAVINGS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE SENSE ACTION AND CONCEPT. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS OVER ITS PARTICULAR VER THE LONGER TERM EXPANSION -- MAY NOT BE -- AS SIGNIFICANT AS HAS ESTIMATED -- ONE ISSUE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT -- THIS PROGRAM TARGETS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES -- WHERE THE COST THE STATE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT BUT THAT ARE WELL SUITED? TO RESIDE IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY IN AFTER A CERTAIN POINT IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WHERE THAT WOULD BE. AFTER A CERTAIN POINT THE POOL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHAT WILL RUN OUT AND AFTER THAT. AND THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS WOULD BE DIMINISH SO IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT -- THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS WOULD BE CONSISTENT OVER THE ENTIRE RAMP UP OF OF THE SENSE ACTION. AT SECOND IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY THE SENATE ACTION LIKELY OVERSTATES THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR A FEW REASONS NUMBER -- ONE WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL STATE OPERATIONS RESOURCES OUT LIKELY NOT MORE THAN A FEW MILLION DOLLARS TO PROCESS THE TO ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FROM A SIGNIFICANT RAMP UP OF SLOTS -- SECOND -- INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL -- BEFORE THE SLOTS COULD BE CREATED -- AND THEN ONCE THE SLOTS ARE CREATED IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO PAY TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND ALTHOUGH THE SENATE ACTION DOES REFLECT. A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THE ADDITIONAL SLOTS OUR SIGNIFICAN AND NUMBER AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE ROLE I WOULD LIKELY BE SLOWER THAN WHAT IT IS SOON TO THE SENATE ACTION. THANK YOU FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR SAVINGS ESTIMATES -- SOME OF THE REASONS WERE DESCRIBED BY THE LA OPEN. IN ADDITION AND WE LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL AND WONDER ABOUT SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY MORE BROADLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPANSION WERE WHETHER TO EXPERT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM. IS A BROADER POLICY DECISION THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRANSFORMATION. THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AS WELL THE RENEWAL OR POSSIBLE RENEWAL OF THIS WAIVER AN INTEGRATION WITH ANOTHER WAIVER. OVER THE NEXT ONE TO TWO YEARS A QUICK QUESTION I HAVE IN TERMS OF THE WAITING LIST BECAUSE THE WAIVER WAS FOR REALLY A MERE FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED SLOT -- IS THAT A NUMBER THAT WE REQUESTED THE WAIVER IS AT LOOK WHAT THE FEDS CAME AND HOW HOW DID THAT NUMBER COME ABOUT -- SINCE WE DO HAVE A WAITING LIST. SO THE WAIVER HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN AT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND SLOTS AND THAT'S BEEN OVER A TEN PLUS YEARS -- WE RECENTLY EXPANDED BY TWO THOUSAND SLOTS IN THE NEW TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- AND THIS WAIVER WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE. RIGHT NOW IT OPERATES AND FIFTEEN COUNTY SO IT'S ALL IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE AT A AT A MINOR. SCALE -- AND SO YES SO STARKLY ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND I'M WORRIED ABOUT SIX THOUSAND NOW -- SLOTS WE CONSIDER AS WE TALK ABOUT IN MANY INSTANCES IN BOTH THE NUMBER POLICY COMMITTEES BUT PLUS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- THE AGING OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IT IF ARE THOUGHT TO BE AT FOUR THOUSAND FOUR DECADE IT JUST SEEMS -- GIVEN THE COST SAVINGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVE THE CAPACITY BEING ASSISTED LIVING VERSUS THE SMITH JUST SEEMS PRUDENT. SO IS THERE -- AS WE GO FORWARD. IF IF THAT YOUR ASSERTION THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE. ISN'T IN THEFISCAL BEST INTERESTS AT THE STAKE IS A BECAUSE WE IN EFFECT WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN -- ARE. DO YOU AT ANY POINT -- HAVE AN INTENTION TO TRY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS. FOR THE WAIVER IN THE FUTURE. SO THEN TEN WHAT DOES WAIVER BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS ONLY LIMITED TO FIFTEEN COUNTIES AND THAT WE WOULD INTEGRATE THIS WAIVER -- WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER DURING THE NEXT RENEWAL IN A FEW YEARS OKAY AND SO THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A BROADER SCALABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- BUT FOR NOW THE WAIVER IS IS LIMITED -- IN SCOPE. GOT IT. QUESTIONS MEMBERS. MISTER MOORE Là. I'M SURE I'M I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE TERM SLOTS. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR PARENTS RIGHT YES TALKING YOU KNOW. BEDS ARE WE TALKING PER CAPITA ARE WE TALKING ONE PERSON PER ROOM TWO PEOPLE PER ROOM. I'VE JUST JUST WONDER IF THERE'S A BETTER TERM. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TELL MY MOTHER WERE LOOKING FOR A SLOT YOU KNOW YOU GET WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A UNITS WERE LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT WERE LOOKING FOR IT DEPENDS ON THE THE FACILITIES SO IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IT'S PROBABLY A BAD. IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY IT COULD BE EITHER OR IT COULD BE A UNIT WHERE SHE WOULD BE AND YOU THE BUYER SELF OR HAVE A ROOMMATE I MEAN I THINK IT VARIES [inaudible] THE STEP. POINT MAYBE WE COULD LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE THAT MAYBE WE CAN FIND BETTER NOMENCLATURE JUST A LITTLE. MORE RESPECTFUL. THANK YOU. I DON'T I'M NOT. A VERSE THE SLOT BUT OKAY WILL WORK ON THAT THANK YOU. OKAY I GOT TO I'M OFFENDED BY CLEARLY. THIRD FOURTH CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. WE'LL WORK ON THAT USE ANYMORE Là. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. DON'T SAY THE WORD SLOT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WEBER. I'M AWAKE YES. I PROMISED I WOULDN'T BE LONG THAT'S WHY -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING ADDED ADDED INDIVIDUALS TO BASICALLY ASSESS. WITHIN A PERSON NEEDS TO BE IN A NURSING HOME OR IN. A IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY AS SOMEONE THAT'S WHY YOU NEED PERSONNEL. IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID. THE MINISTER OF THE PROGRAM -- ACCORDING TO THIS EXPANSION SO GOING FROM FROM SIX THOUSAND SLOTS APPROXIMATELY TWO EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER. THE EXPANSION. AND THE ADDITIONAL PERSON THOUGH ARE ARE ALREADY ASSUME IN SOME SYSTEM IS THAT CORRECT THESE ARE. COMPLETELY NEW INDIVIDUALS. THE WORK CURRENTLY AT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND SLOTS BUT THE EXPANSION WOULD BE NEW INDIVIDUALS. OKAY. SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED THE EXTRA ONE NOT NECESSARILY MOVING PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH FROM THE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TO A A A A DIFFERENT. LEVEL OF CARE. SO THESE WOULD BE PRINT BRENDA PEOPLE WE WOULD NOT BE ASSESSING THOSE WILL CURRENTLY IN A FACILITY. THAT IS A SAY AT THE NURSING FACILITY AND DECIDING THAT THEY DON'T NEED AS MUCH CARE AND THEREFORE IT'S COULD BE PLACED INTO. AN ASSISTED LIVING IS OR WOULD THAT ALSO OCCUR THESE WOULD BE NEW BENEFICIARIES -- FOR DISH ADDITIONAL BEDS FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFICIARIES OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK THEY'RE COMING FROM SMITH BUT I THINK THEY'RE COMING FROM SNIFF DOCTOR WEBER WITH THAT YEAH THEIR CRIME WAS AND I WAS WONDERING BECAUSE IT WAS THEY WERE GOING TO SAVE MONEY BY HAVING. A FEW OF THEM INTO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BECAUSE OF THE COST. OF THE CONTRACT RIGHT AND AND AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS HAT I WOULD THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THEY'RE ALREADY. DEALING WITH THIS POPULATION YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE ASK FOR STAFF AND WE REALLY DON'T NEED STAFF BECAUSE YOU DEAL WITH THE SAME POPULATION AND YOU DOING AN ASSESSMENT. OF WHERE THEY ARE AND WITHIN THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT BUT IF YOU'RE ADDING NEW PEOPLE YOU MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL PERSON I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WITH WHAT WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING -- AND AND CLEARLY MOVING ON FROM A HIGHER NEED TO A A LESSEN THE FACILITY IS ALWAYS THAT ONLY COST SAVING BUT IT'S ALSO BETTER FOR THE PERSON WHO'S IN THAT LESS A FACILITY. OF ITS THE SO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE IN PACE BE INVOLVED IN THIS AT ANY POINT A WE LOOKING AT PACE IN THIS I WAS AT A TOTALLY SEPARATE PROGRAM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS A SEPARATE PROGRAM BUT I WILL GO BACK AND CONFIRM. OKAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S QUITE A COST SAVINGS AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU AND SO THE LAST THING I WILL ADD ON ON THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT -- AT THE SICK A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THIS SIZE WE DO HAVE CAPACITY CONCERN SO THE AVAILABILITY OF BEDS ON THE GROUND. AND SO -- THE RECENT EXPANSION TO TWO THOUSAND SLOTS HAS -- WE ARE STILL FACING AND THAT EXPANSION AND SO DID WANT TO NOTE THAT FOR FOR CONSIDERATION. AND WE WOULD BE ASKING YOU TO TO DOUBLE. HISTORICALLY WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FROM FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED TO AN ADDITIONAL. TEN THOUSAND OKAY. ANY MORE QUESTIONS. OKAY THREE NUMBER GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- ACCORDING TO THE CLOCK ON THE WALL IT'S TEN MINUTES.

BE SPECIFIC TO THIS POPULATION AND THE THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDI CAL FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. IS. VERY IN MY OPINION LARGE GOAL BUT IT WAS ALSO. FOR KNOWING THAT. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IT. THAT A MOTHER IN A BABY ARE AT THE GET THE PROPER -- PRENATAL CARE SO THAT WE SO THAT WE IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AFTER ALL -- AFTERWARDS. AND THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET. THE WOMEN COVERAGE OF A DIFFERENT SORT IMMEDIATELY. AND TO BE DROPPED WITHIN THAT SIXTY DAYS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GOING THROUGH POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. WHEN THEY ARE EVEN LESS CAPABLE OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET? OTHER TYPES OF COVERAGE SO I THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW WE COULD -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHETHER WE HAVE ANY DATA ON FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SENATE SEAT POINT SIX MILLION IS BASED ON SOME NUMBERS THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW SO I GUESS WHAT I'M RAISING IS. THERE MIGHT BE THE ABILITY TO REFINER HONED WITH THE NEEDED AMOUNT IS. BUT FROM A DOLLAR POINT OF VIEW. BUT THE NEED ITSELF IS REAL.

PEOPLE SO WE THINK THE STATE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN REACHING OUT TO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM COVERAGE IN CARE. AND THE ONE OTHER THING I SHOULD MENTION AND I KNOW THIS IS A CONFERENCE ISSUE FOR LATER BUT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND COVER CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THAT. THAT WILL FURTHER STABILIZE THE MARKET AND MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM INCLUDING MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY. THANK YOU COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MISTER MAYES. A JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BACKGROUND I'M HERE NOW. BUT FOR SOME REASON THIS WEEKEND I GOT BORED OR A SYSTEM MY MIND STARTED TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD AND I TRIED -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW EASY WOULD BE TO BUILD UP APPLY FOR MEDI CAL -- YOU A YEAH -- AND AND ACTUALLY -- WHAT START OFF AT THE -- DH CS SINCE AT ALL YEAH JUST CLICK HERE AND THEN IT. SENT ME TO THE NEXT PLANE CAN SET A WHICH COUNTER YOU AND SO I CLICKED ON SENATOR DINO. AND I GOT DECEMBER DINO AND THEN IT SAID -- PLEASE CLICK TO THIS HERE AND I THOUGHT. I HAVE NO IDEA NOW ONCE I'VE GOT THAT HOW TO APPLY NOW YOU CAN APPLY ON COVER CALIFORNIA -- I UNDERSTAND -- OF COURSE GOING THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS. BUT IF YOU WERE THINKING YOURSELF YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO APPLY FOR MEDI CAL. THERE'S NOT A QUICK AND EASY WAY AT LEAST FOR ME AND I'M NOT VERY SMART NOW MIND YOU BUT IF YOU'RE THE PUBLIC. TOM IT'S TOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HEY GO UP AND UP AND APPLIES SO IS THAT WHAT THESE THESE DOLLARS. ARE FOR TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT SIMPLE BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY WANTED TO APPLY ARE ACTUALLY WHAT THE PROCESS BEGIN TO APPLY. WE SHOULD BE MAKING THIS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE DOLLARS WILL BE PRIMARILY TARGETED -- TO PROVIDING FUNDING TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD HELP LOCATE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE BUT DON'T KNOW OR AREN'T SURE HOW TO PLAN ASSISTING THEM IT WOULD NOT BE IS RELATED. TO CHANGING THE WAY THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS WORKS. THANK YOU YOU HAVE NO I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE JUST MAKING IT SIMPLE I THINK IF YOU KNOW HEY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. FOR FOR MEDI CAL IS THAT YOU GO TO COVER CALIFORNIA WHAT IS COVERED CALIFORNIA MEANER DISCOVER CALIFORNIA YOU GOT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IN ON MICHAEL LEADS YOU -- LEAD LEAD TO THEIR YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ON ON YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT FOLKS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY SIMPLE AND USER FRIENDLY. WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO IT TO TRY TO UP TO APPLY AT LEAST IT DID FOR ME -- OVER THE WEEKEND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING MONEY -- I I THINK MAYBE THE FIRST STEP IN SPENDING SOME MONEY IS MAKING IT VERY SIMPLE -- AND AND HAVING -- A THE USER INTERFACE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO A TO DO IT THAT'S JUST MY THOUGHTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CAN I FEAR NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. ISSUE TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS -- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES LA -- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS PROGRAM ADDENDA FI'S INDIVIDUALS IN AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING SUCH AS A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY -- THAT CAN LIVE SAFELY IN A COMMUNITY -- SETTING AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO FACILITATE THIS TRANSITION -- AS AN EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM HAS MOVED -- SOME INDIVIDUALS INTO THE ASSISTANT LIFE LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM WHICH WE DISCUSSED -- ON A PREVIOUS ITEM. THIS PROGRAM HAS LARGELY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH A FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM KNOWN AS MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON REBALANCING DEMONSTRATION WHICH EXPIRES. IN SEPTEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR HAS NO PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA AND THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO BACK FILL THE LOSS OF FEDERAL MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON GRANT FUNDING TO ALLOW THIS PROGRAM TO CONTINUE -- BUT ALSO ASSUMES OFFSETTING SAVINGS OF AN EQUAL AMOUNT -- IN LIGHT OF THE THE THE ASSUMPTION THAT PICKED COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS ARE LESS COSTLY THAN INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENTS. AND TRANSITIONS IN THE PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT ARE SHARED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ACTUAL EXTENT OF OFFSETTING SAVINGS FROM THE X. SIMPLY ACTION IS UNCERTAIN -- IN OUR VIEW THIS WOULD DEPEND IN PART ON WHICH SERVICES THE STATE COULD RECEIVE REGULAR FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS. FOR NOW THAT THE FEDERAL MONEY FOLLOWS PERSON GRANT FUNDING HAS THAT WILL BE EXPIRING -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING ON AN ESTIMATE FOR THIS ACTION BUT WE'VE NOT RECEIVED IT OR HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IT AT THIS TIME. FINANCE THIS ITEM IS NOT IN OUR BUDGET AS LA -- MENTIONED THAT FEDERAL GRANT EXPIRES THIS SEPTEMBER AND WE ARE NOT SURE IF IT WILL BE RENEWED SO THAT COULD CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE STATE BUDGET.

AND TO BE EXPENDED OVER THREE YEARS THIS FUNDING WOULD BE TO EXPAND SERVICE DELIVERY BY THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AND TO SCALE UP AND IT SYSTEM THAT. IS CURRENTLY USED BY TWO OF THE LARGEST CENTERS -- TO THE REMAINING CENTERS IN THE STATE. BEFORE WE GO TO FINANCE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE THE ELEVEN CENTERS ARE DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION BY ANY CHANCE -- YES THEY ARE LOCATED IN THERE'S A A REDWOOD -- CENTER DELAURO -- SOME OF THESE I JUST HAVE THE NAMES OF THEM IN THE GENERAL LOCATIONS -- INLAND EMPIRE ORANGE COUNTY SAN DIEGO -- ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- THERE'S A BAY AREA -- FACILITY THAT APPEARS TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO THOSE ARE THE APPROXIMATE LOCATIONS.

STD TREATMENT FUNDING DISPUTES ALEJO -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED -- THROUGH -- WITH WITH COUNTY FUNDING INCLUDING REALIGNMENT FUNDING THAT THE THE THE THE STATE A SENSE TO COUNTIES -- THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL ON THIS ITEM AND THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION WELL THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS -- FOR RESOLVING COUNTY OF RESIDENCE -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FUNDING DISPUTES WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKS TREATMENT IN A COUNTY OF WHICH THEY ARE NOT A RESIDENT. FINANCE THE COST CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE UNCERTAIN SO IT'S NOT IN OUR BUDGET MEMBERS [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] SKINNER. I WONDERED IF THE MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR THIS BUDGET BUT WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS LOOKED AT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THE FACT THAT WE ADMINISTER SO MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THROUGH COUNTIES HAS -- ALL SAY INTERFERED NUTS NOT WITH THE JUDGMENT BUT RATHER. JUST A FACT WITH THE ABILITY OF A RECIPIENT -- TO ACCESS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S ADMINISTERED INDIVIDUALLY BY EACH COUNTY WE HAD DURING THE RECESSION. THE DIFFICULTY WHERE A FAMILY WOULD BE -- EITHER FORECLOSED ON OR SOMEHOW YOU KNOW HAVE TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND THEY COULDN'T JUST BRING THEIR BENEFITS WITH THEM THEY HAD TO COMPLETELY START OVER AND RE APPLY. AND WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR PROBLEM NOW HERE WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND OF COURSE WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AT LEAST WITH CAL FRESH. NO MATTER WHICH COUNTY URINEYOU CAN GET IT BUT THERE'S NOT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY -- AND THERE'S MANY MANY OTHER I COULD GIVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WERE SIMILAR WHERE WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE. THIS KIND OF NEAR GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISION OF COUNTY. DOESN'T RELATE TO THE ACTUAL NEED OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO NEEDS A SERVICE OR THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE. SO WHEN I SAW THIS ITEM I THOUGHT YOU KNOW SETTING UP A DISPUTE MEDIATION JUST FOR THIS. ONE WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY SUCH A BY THIS -- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE IT SO AND PEOPLE CAN KERRY THERE.

THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL AND APPROVED INSTEAD TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND -- FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO FIND -- IT'S EARLY PSYCHOSIS IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS INTERVENTION PLUS PROGRAM THAT IT IT OPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE GENERAL FUND ARE TO BE USED FOR THIS PROGRAM INSTEAD OF WHAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN.

FOR THE SENATE VERSUS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ASSEMBLY -- AS WELL AS THE FUNDING SOURCE GENERAL FUND ON THE SENATE SIDE AND TOWARD AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE.

IN THESE TYPES OF CASES. THE SECOND POINT IS WE WANTED THIS TO BE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE FOR WE ARE PROPOSING IN OUR BUDGET. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND FOR THE WEB PROGRAM WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND I KNOW ALSO EARLIER TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS SO WE THINK THAT IS THE BEST USE. OF THAT MONEY SO ANY REDIRECTION OF THAT MONEY WOULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND THEN THE THIRD POINT OUR PROPOSAL IS A ONE TIME AND SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE HERE ARE ONGOING. AND BECAUSE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THIS MONEY COMES FROM THE TAX OF ABOUT THE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT REVENUE -- IS CAN BE FALL TILE FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WE pFUNDING FROM THAT REVENUE SOURCES MORE APPROPRIATE MEMBERS.

FROM TAKING FUNDS IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IN PATIENT HOSPITAL BANK ACCOUNTS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE ACTION GIVEN THAT TAKING FUNDS FROM PATIENT ACCOUNTS ONLY CREATES A MINOR STATE BENEFIT. ROUGHLY ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PATIENTS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES UPON THE RELEASE WHICH COULD INDIRECTLY CREATE GREATER HA COSTS FOR THE STATE IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU FINANCE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEE NONE WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. ITEM FIFTY ONE PREMIUM AFFORDABILITY SYSTEMS AND MANDATE PENALTY [inaudible] HELLO. FOR THIS ISSUE -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL MARKET HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR QUALIFYING INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED ENACTING A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WITHIN ASSOCIATED PENALTY THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND TO USE THESE COUNTY REVENUES TO FIND -- THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE BOUNTY REVENUES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR. THE MAYOR VISION PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE SUBSIDIES IN NINETEEN TWENTY FROM THE GENERAL FUND WITH THAT AMOUNT GROWING SOMEWHAT IN THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS AND THE SUBS SON SUBSIDIES% THEN SUN SETTING AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN CONTRAST THE COUNTY WOULD BE ON GOING. AND WOULD BE PROJECTED TO FULLY REIMBURSE THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE COST OF THE SUBSIDIES OVER THAT PERIOD. THE SENATE AUGMENTED FUNDING FOR THE SUBSIDIES BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- OVER THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IN EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWO THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES LESS THAN 2100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO ALSO RECEIVE SUBSIDIES. IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE SUBSIDIES BE LIMITED TO PENALTY REVENUES. IT SPECIFIES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY WOULD ONLY BE IN EFFECT WHEN A CERTAIN MINIMUM LEVEL OF SUBSIDIES EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE -- ARE PROVIDED. THAT IT EXEMPTS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID MEDICARE MEDICARE I'LL EXCUSE ME FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT -- CERTAIN -- RECIPIENTS OF THE SUBSIDIES RECONCILE THEIR SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE STATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM WHEN THE RECONCILIATION IS SMALL. AND IT WOULD REQUIRE -- THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO REPORT CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE PENALTY. IT WOULD SUNSET A PROPOSED EXEMPTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT AFTER THREE YEARS. AND FINALLY THE SENATE ACTION WOULD NOT EXEMPT FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN. HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS WHICH ARE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ALLOW MEMBERS TO SHARE SOME OF EACH OTHER'S MEDICAL COSTS BUT ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE STATE. AS INSURANCE. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE LOWER AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR SUBSIDIES THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IN. NINETEEN TWENTY BUT REJECTED THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE I'M IN FAVOR OF CONSIDERING SUCH CHANGES THROUGH THE POLICY BILL PROCESS. I'M BRIEFLY SIMILAR COMMENTS ON THIS WE'VE PREVIOUSLY NOTED THAT -- THE STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE MERIT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. AS A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. AND WETHINK IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY WITH -- SUBSIDIES AT THE SAME TIME. TO OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE OF THE MANDATE PENALTY. HOWEVER WE HAVE FOUND THAT LIMITING FUNDING FOR THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIES TO THE PARA COUNTY REVENUES COULD BE PROBLEMATIC -- SINCE THE GOAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AS A DETERRENT AGAINST FOR GOING. ON INSURANCE COVERAGE IS AT ODDS WITH THE GOAL OF RAISING REVENUES FOR THE SUBSIDIES. AND FINALLY WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUNSET THE SUBSIDIES CREATES BUDGETARY PRESSURES TO CONTINUE THE SUBSIDIES -- IN LATER YEARS. THE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACH OF DEFERRING ENACTMENT OF LANGUAGE TO THE POLICY PROCESS WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER THERE ARE REASONS TO PURSUE MORE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THESE POLICIES PARTICULARLY IF A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND THE SUBSIDIES. AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS DESIRED. AND THE REASON IS THAT THESE POLICIES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE REST MIX IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET WHICH FEEDS INTO THE RATES THAT -- INSURERS THE PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET WILL SET AND THOSE RATES -- TYPICALLY WOULD NEED TO BE SET BY JULY -- TWENTY NINETEEN AS A RESULT THE LÏNG ACKMAN OF LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THE MANDATE OR THE SUBSIDIES -- COULD MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO GET THOSE RATES SET AND GET ALL OF THESE POLICIES IMPLEMENTED BY. TWENTY TWENTY THANK YOU FOR THAT LA L.. NOT ELIO FERNANDO. PEOPLE MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST -- FOR SEVERAL THE REASONS THAT THE LA -- JUST MENTIONED THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS SHOULD TAKE PLACE TO BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF THE IN AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND SUBSIDIES. PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE AS LA -- GENOCIDE IF WE WANT TO START THIS PROGRAM BY JULY BY JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR COVER CALIFORNIA REALLY NEED CERTAINTY BY NEXT MONTH JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE MATCH UP AS BEST AS WE COULD ESTIMATE. THE MONEY RAISED BY THE MANDATE PENALTY -- WITH THE SUBSIDIES THAT WE ARE SPENDING AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGES BEYOND THAT PROCESS WHETHER IT'S DIRECT ADDITIONAL FUNDS OR WHETHER IT'S CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY OR EXEMPTIONS BEYOND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED. COULD RESULT IN COST PRESSURES ON THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO ABSORB OR WOULD HAVE TO TRADE OFF AGAINST OTHER PROGRAMS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT OFFSET PRINCIPLE. IS IMPORTANT HERE AND THEN THE FINAL POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM AND WE ARE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION IN TERMS OF THIS LEVEL OF SUBSIDIES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF HOW THIS PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IN DESIGNED IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT BOTH IN THE FIRST YEAR BUT ALSO IN THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM. I WOULD CERTAINLY IS A SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF ANNUAL REVIEW I AGREE. BY ANY CONTENT OF COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS ON THIS ITEM TAMARA. SO. I GUESS WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WORKING OR WHETHER PREMIUMS ARE. DECLINING ARE LEVELING OUT ARE RISING THEY SEEM TO BE RISING INTO. WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS A TAX INCREASE -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME PROPOSALS TO TRY TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. ANI I WILL GO THERE BUT I JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A BIG A BIG DEAL. AND AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING ON SOME INTERESTING ISSUES AND I WOULD THINK THAT A LITTLE MORE TIME -- MORE DISCUSSION IS WARRANTED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. WELL HOLD ON A MOTION MOVED TO ISSUE. FIFTY TWO SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS [inaudible] RIGHT. THE HOUR. IS. FOR THE FOLKS MARK [inaudible] RIGHT.

IN -- PROVIDED AN INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND LEVELS FOR THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM BUT DIFFERENT AMOUNTS THE SENATE PROVIDED SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING -- WHILE THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT ACROSS MULTIPLE YEARS IN ADDITION THE ASSEMBLY REQUESTED PERIODIC UPDATES STARTING JANUARY TEN TWENTY TWENTY SO THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS. WHETHER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND -- WHETHER THAT GENERAL FUND SHOULD BE ONGOING -- ONE TIME AND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. HOLD THE ITEM OPEN. A VARIETY OF ADJUSTMENTS ISSUE FIFTY THREE ELIA. ARE THE SENATE APPROVED TO AUGMENTATIONS ONE WOULD PROVIDE FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PAUL PAUL PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE LOCAL AREAS -- OF AGING. THE OTHER WOULD PROVIDE FIVE MILLION ON GOING TO EXPAND THE USE OF THE NO WRONG DOOR MODEL WITHIN THE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS. THE GOVERNOR SIMPLY HAD NO PROPOSES RELATED TO THESE PROGRAMS THUS THE ISSUE BEFORE IS WHETHER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THESE PROGRAMS. FINANCE NO PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ISSUE. FIFTY THREE HOLDEN THE ITEM OPEN ISSUE FIFTY FOUR FUNDING FOR ADMIN SUPPORT. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. HISTORICALLY THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE HAS SOLELY RELIED ON REVENUES FROM ITS TAX CHECKOFF FUND HOWEVER REESE IN RECENT YEARS -- THE REVENUES FROM THE TAX CHECKOFF FUND HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO COVER OPERATIONAL COSTS -- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE WITH TEMPORARY GENERAL FUND ASSISTANCE HOWEVER -- IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET THE GOVERNOR DID NOT PROPOSE ANY GENERAL FUND ASSISTANCE THE ASSEMBLY DID PROVIDE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO COVER CSL OPERATING COST. THE SENATE HAS NO PROPOSAL THUS THE ISSUE BEFORE USE WHETHER TO PROVIDE THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE WITH ONGOING FUNDING. FINANCE. IN MINISTRATION VOICE TO SENIOR LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE SUFFICIENT RESERVES TO COVER BUDGET EXPENSES FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. I VIçT. YES I WOULD NOTE THAT -- THAT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF TAX REVENUES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THUS WHILE THIS CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING IN NINETEEN TWENTY THERE IS STILL A QUESTION. OF WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR FUTURE YEARS THROUGH THE TAX CHECKOFF FUND -- ENOUGH [inaudible] HI. THE MORE LOT MEASURE THAT DOES THE SENIOR. LEGISLATURE DO ANY OTHER FUND RAISING BESIDES THE CHECK OFF BOX. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DO TRY TO GET VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ON BESIDES THE TAX CHECK OFF FUND AND THAT'S PART OF THEIR INITIATIVE AS WELL TO SEE IF BUT THEY COULD INCREASE THOSE EFFORTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY MORE QUESTIONS. WILL PULL THE ITEM OPEN MOVING. TO DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF REHAB. ISSUE. FIFTY FIVE STABILIZING SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS. LA JOH NA PARTICULARLY -- ACTUALLY OF A HAND OUT RELATED TO THIS ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD YOU SO. MANAGERS PRESENT FROM FROM THE HAND OUT -- SO I'LL START BY NOTING THAT AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES HAS -- WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS AN OUTDATED? COMPLEX AND NON TRANSPARENT RATE SETTING PROCESS CURRENTLY -- IT'S A IT'S SOME OF THE TARGETED BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE FURTHER COMPLICATED THE WAY THAT RATES ARE SET [inaudible] AND IMPROVE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ESTABLISHED METHODS FOR SETTING RATES SOME OF THESE BUDGET SOLUTIONS HAVE LED TO A SITUATION WHERE THOSE ESTABLISHED METHODS ARE JUST ON PAPER THOSE ARE REALLY THE METHODS THAT WE USE ANY LONGER TO SET THE RATES? AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIGNIFICANT -- AND SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE RATES PAID TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE OTHERWISE SIMILAR. SO THIS A PROBLEM REALLY IN THE RATE SETTING PROCESS IN THE DDS SYSTEM RESULTED IN THE LEGISLATURE CALLING FOR A RATE STUDY -- THIS WAS A RESULT OF SPECIAL SESSION LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATION PROVIDED THREE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. AND THE STUDY WAS DUE ON MARCH FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO -- JUST IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR MARCH FIFTEENTH DDS AND ITS CONSULTANTS SUBMITTED A DRAFT RATE STUDY REPORT INCLUDING THE THE PROPOSED RATE SETTING MODELS FOR EACH OF THE SERVICE CATEGORIES. AND BUT ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THE SYSTEM WAS UNDERFUNDED BY ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT TWO GENERAL FUND. A RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- SO. THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EACH APPROVED PROPOSALS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT RESPOND IN PART TO THE RATE STUDY BUT ALSO -- TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FACING IN RECENT YEARS SO. I'LL DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY A PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THEN APPROVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT. WE HAVE A A TABLE THAT SORT OF DOCUMENTS THESE DIFFERENCES. SO THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THIS IS A HALF YOUR COST BECAUSE THE RATE INCREASE THESE ARE. FOR A TARGETED RATE INCREASES IN FOUR DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS THIS REPRESENTS A HALF YOUR COSTS BECAUSE THE RATE INCREASES WOULD BEGIN JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY N. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS INCLUDES A SMALL AMOUNT -- FOR SOME OF THE RATES THAT ARE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION SYSTEM THAT CONFORM. TO THE RATE LEVELS IN THE DDS SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY FOR SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED TO SUSPEND -- A POLICY CALLED THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY SCHEDULE RATHER THAT -- ESSENTIALLY PROHIBITS -- PAYMENT FOR SERVICES ON FOURTEEN SAID DAYS PER YEAR -- BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNOR WOULD SUNSET ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE SENATE -- APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'SPROPOSAL FOR RATE INCREASES BUT REJECTED THE SUNSET. THE SENATE ALSO APPROVED -- AN ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASE -- IT SAID THAT IT WANTED TO PROVIDE AN ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASE FOR ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT JUST THE FOR THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET AD ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD PROVIDE 8% ACROSS THE BOARD. TO ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN THE ONES THAT WERE PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S OF A PROPOSAL MAKE END UP GETTING AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE. IN IN HIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THIS WOULD COME AT A COST OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A HALF YOUR COSTS OF THE ANNUAL IS COSTS WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND -- I'M GONNA JUST GO THROUGH THE RATE INCREASE DIFFERENCES AND THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER -- AS THINGS THAT WERE PROPOSED A APPROVED BY BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY -- SO I WHEN IT COMES TO READING CREASES THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED TO THE AMOUNT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION -- BUT INSTEAD OF TARGETING IT WOULD APPLY IT ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO THAT RESULTS IN AOUT A 526% ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ACTION -- THIS I'M SORRY THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY ALSO REJECTED THE THE SUNSET THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. THEY'RE ALSO IN A NUMBER OF OTHER POLICY CHANGES -- THAT THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TOOK ACTION ON SO I'M I'M GOING TO JUST NAME THEM AND IF YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DETAILS I AM HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. BUT THE SENATE APPROVED -- FIXING WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK THAT COMES AT A COST OF NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WOULD BE -- REAL IT WOULD FUNDS THAT -- INCREASES STARTING WITH THE JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. BOTH HE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY VOTED TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE RATHER THAN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING IT. THAT WOULD COME AT A COST OF THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY VOTED TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL WHAT'S CALLED THE HALF DAY BILLING POLICY THIS IS HAS A RELATIVELY MODEST COST OF ONE POINT SIX MILLION. FROM THE GENERAL FUND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND THE BOTH OF THOSE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. PARDON ME AND THEY HAVE TO A BILLING POLICY WERE BULLS ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE RECESSION AS A BUDGET SOLUTION. SO IN SOME WAYS THIS IS SORT OF RESTORING SOME FUNDING TO THE SYSTEM -- BUT THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ALSO RESTORED CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED DURING THE RECESSION. SO SPECIFICALLY THE SENATE APPROVED RESTORATION OF SOCIAL CAMPAñA RECREATION SERVICES AT A COST OF TWO POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BE SORT OF A PARTIAL COST AS IT RAMPS UP. THE FULL ANNUALIZED COST WOULD BE FOUR POINT NINE GENERAL FUND. FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND THE ASSEMBLY ALSO APPROVED RESTORATION OF SOCIAL RECREATION IN CAMP -- AS WELL AS NON MEDICAL THERAPIES AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AGES -- THREE THREE SEVENTEEN THE TWENTY NINETEEN CAR TWENTY COSTS THERE IS FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THAT WOULD RAMP UP TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND. FINALLY -- BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY APPROVED PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT A RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS THE START DATE FOR WHEN RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION WOULD NEED TOHAPPEN. JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE SENATE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE ASSEMBLY. SO. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS -- THEIR NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO TAKE IN THIS AREA A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS -- FOR IT FOR YOU MEMBERS TO CONSIDER. ONE THING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE HAVE. ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY EACH ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF PHYSICAL RELIEF TO SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE DDS SYSTEM. THEY ALSO EACH. WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THE BROADER ISSUE OF RATE REFORM -- THE DEPARTMENT SAID IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS THAT IT WAS OPEN TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS OVER THE SUMMER ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE ACTUALLY WANT TO CODIFY THAT REQUIREMENT SO BENT AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT. TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND ACTUALLY DEVELOP A PLAN FOR REFORM IMPLEMENTATION -- IN OUR VIEW. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS. IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT PREPARE A RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND SUBMIT IT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROPOSAL. IF. IF VIEWED IN THAT LIGHT ANY OF THE SOLUTIONS IN NINETEEN AND IN BUDGET YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY COULD BE VIEWED AS SORT OF AN INTERIM -- STEP TOWARD. FULL RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION AND THE LONGER TERM GOAL OF ESTABLISHING A TRANSPARENT AND LOGICAL RATE SETTING PROCESS. SO THE TWO THINGS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER OF A FOR FOR NINETEEN TWENTY YEAH IF YOU WERE TO APPROVE THE THE IDEA OF REQUIRING A RATE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. IS WHAT THE LEVEL OF PROVIDER FISCAL RELIEF DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN DO YOU WANT TO USE ANY OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE RATE STUDY IN THE ACTIONS THAT YOU TAKE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SO I WOULD NOTE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- AS I MENTIONED IS TARGETED TO FOR SERVICE AREAS AND THEY BASED THEIR SELECTION OF SERVICE CATEGORIES ON SOME OF THE FINE FINDINGS FROM THE RATE STUDY WHICH INDICATED -- THAT SOME AREAS -- WERE WERE PERHAPS MORE UNDER FUNDED THAN OTHER AREAS AND THEY ALSO -- TOOK SOME STEPS TO TRY TO REDUCE SOME OF THE INEQUITIES BETWEEN. SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE OTHERWISE SIMILAR [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] I AM. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE THERESA. THERESA CALAR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN MINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL OF TARGETED -- SUPPLEMENTALS SERVICE INCREASES SERVICE RATE INCREASES AS WELL AS COMPLIMENTARY TRAILER BILL THAT'S THE NEXT ISSUE REGARDING THE OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY. FACTORS THAT THE LA ALLUDED. TO THE SKINNER FOLLOWED BY THE THANK YOU. TOM THIS IS A FRUSTRATING ITEM FOR ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE WHEN I WAS -- BEFORE I LEFT THE ASSEMBLY WE WERE DEALING WITH THIS VERY SAME ISSUE O THAT WAS. TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY. I THE SERMON TO BILL AS ELLIE -- STUDY SHOWS IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN LA WAS REPORT SHOWS THAT ASKED FOR A. D. D. S. TO CONDUCT THEIR STUDY. OF A SERVICE PROVIDER RATE SETTING PROCESS AND WHILE THE LANGUAGE IN THAT WASN'T EXPLICIT. TO PREPARING A A RE REFORM PROPOSAL IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS YOU COULD HAVE INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE BUT I WOULD HAVE INTERPRETED IT PROBABLY THAT IT WAS ASKING. FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO TELL US HOW TO MAKE THIS FUNDING LEVEL SUSTAINABLE WHICH IS PROBABLY A RATE REFORM PROPOSALS SO HERE WE ARE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY EN LA -- IS RECOMMENDING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT YET THAT WE PUT IN SOME OTHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASKING HIM FOR ANOTHER STUDY AND I'M KIND OF LIKE -- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE HAVE TO DO THAT I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT WHAT YOU BUT AND IT'S MORE SPECIFIC. BUT I'M EXPRESSING A FRUSTRATION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVEN IF WE CROSS THE TEASE IN DOT THE ICE. WE MAY NOT STILL GET WHAT WE NEED FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN AND WE'RE TO AND I'M TALKING NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. WE HAVE NOT GIVEN FOR THE WE'VE ONLY GIVEN TO RATE INCREASES OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF ESTIMATES THAT THIS THE NEED IS. THE THAT WERE BEHIND IN TERMS OF DEFINING NEED BY OVER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION -- AND I I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A POPULATION. THIS REALLY IS LIKE OUR FOSTER KIDS LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHERS THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THAT WE NEED TO ASSIST IN WERE FAILING -- I WOULD SUPPORT THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL. A A I KNOW IT DOES NOT ANSWER THE LONG TERM AND WE POTENTIALLY SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT DE LA ALWAYS RECOMMENDING IN TERMS OF VERY SPECIFIC WORDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO COME BACK WITH. BUT I FEEL LIKE WHAT THEY'VE COME BACK SO FAR WITH THE THINGS WE VAST IS VERY INADEQUATE. THANK YOU TO STORM. I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN WE FOR STARTED THE OVERALL -- PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONFERENCE AND JUST TO JUST KIND OF WANTED TO REITERATE -- FOR US WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE SUNSET PROVISIONS THE MINISTRATION. HANDED THEM WE THOUGHT THAT -- ANA HE'S WERE NOT WHAT I'M EXPENDITURES. THAT THE THE RATE INCREASES WOULD BE USED TO CALL HIGHER INDIVIDUALS. THAT THESE WOULD BE JOBS THAT WOULD -- NEED TO BE -- PLACE WITH INDIVIDUALS AND THAT JUST. TAKING THE MONEY AWAY IN TWO YEARS JUST MEANT THOSE INDIVIDUAL GET LAID OFF I DON'T KNOW IF. LA -- COULD SORT OF JUST COMMENT ON THAT -- OF THE THIRD SET AND THEN GO BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION. YES -- WE WERE VERY CONCERNED TO SEE THE SUNSET PROPOSALS AS WELL BECAUSE THESE AE REALLY ONGOING SERVICES AND ONE OF THE THE RATIONALES -- FOR TARGETING FOR EXAMPLE. I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REASONS THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE FOR TARGETING RATE INCREASES TO RESIDENTIAL CARE PROVIDERS WAS THE NEED TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. OBVIOUSLY SEND SETTING THOSE RATE INCREASES K. COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DESTABILIZING THE SYSTEM. I THINK THE MAIN THING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS -- WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR BROADER REFORM AND SO WE ARE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS UP BETWEEN NOW NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND ARE PROPOSED SUNSET WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE FORWARD ON THAT PATH. I MAKES. SENSE BUT I THINK IT'S AGAIN I DO IT DOCTOR'S RESPONSE TO MY EARLIER POINT WHICH IS. THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE PEOPLE IF THEY THINK THE ONLY HAVE A JOB. FOR FOR TWO YEARS AND VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS PUSH WHEN PEOPLE. ARE GETTING PAID THAT MUCH TO WORK AT THESE. FACILITIES THAT IT IS MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND COULD KICK IN. I'M NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF STABILIZATION THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE. ON I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION WAS IS -- THERE ARE OTHER DIFFERENT NEW PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET WHY NOT SUNSET A NEW PROPOSAL RATHER THAN. SOMETHING THAT IS A A RATE INCREASE OF A LONG STANDING PROGRAM THAT WE'VE MADE. HAD A LONG COMMITMENT. TO I THINK THERE BECAUSE THIS RATE STUDY JUST CAME OUT IN MARCH SO JUST ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'LL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME.% WE THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE IT IS MOST RIGHT FOR THAT KIND OF RETHINKING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND WE ARE COMMITTED WE KNOW IT'S ALWAYS HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS BUT TO BENDING THE COST CURVE IN TRYING TO GET MORE. WHILE SPENDING LESS. I KNOW IT'S LATE IN -- BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT TO JUMP ON A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THIS IS A NOT A BI PARTISAN BUT NINE NON PARTISAN ISSUE THINK ABOUT THE LETTERMAN ACT -- BUT IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY FRUSTRATING WE HAVE MORE REVENUE OF THAT'S COME INTO THE STATE BUDGET THIS YEAR THAN ANY -- THAT THEN IN HISTORY. AND YET THIS COMMUNITY. THE DD COMMUNITY SEEMS TO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED WE GOT WE DO A STUDY WE FIND OUT YEAH THEY NEED MORE MONEY. AND THEN WE SAY ALL. TO DO MORE STUDIES WE ARE WITH A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER. AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN WERE -- WHEN WERE PRIORITIZING? OUR RESOURCES WHY IN THE WORLD THIS COMMUNITY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR GETS THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. I I I DON'T I DON'T GET IT BECAUSE WHEN I LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES WHEN WE'RE WE'RE DEBATING THIS ON THE FLOOR AND COMMITTEE WE ALL SAY THAT WERE FOR THIS COMMUNITY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE PROVIDERS OF THEIR IN MY IN MY DISTRICT -- ARE ARE ARE ABOUT THE ABOUT DONE THERE ONLY CONTINUING ON BECAUSE THEY CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THESE THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID. ENOUGH THEY'RE DOING IT I'M OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF THEIR HEART BUT THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH WHEN DO WE IS THE STATE SAY OKAY IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TO JUST THIS. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO STEP TO STEP UP -- I THINK IT'S A IT'S ABOUT TIME AND AGAIN I'VE THIS FRUSTRATION AMEND MY VOICE NEVER THIS FROM OTHERS THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE ALL OF US SAYING I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE HANG UP IS MAYBE YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON IT? SO THE ADMINISTRATION WE COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THIS IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE AND I THINK I WOULD MAKE A TWO POINTS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT SENATOR SKINNER SAID AS WELL THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE. ALL BEEN LOOKING AT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT IS THAT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT IT'S ALSO NOT INSIGNIFICANT EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET WE THINK THIS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY BUT THE TARGETED APPROACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED WE THINK IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN IMPROVING ACCESS FOR THIS COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR OFTEN SAYS ACROSS ISSUES HE SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RESOURCES BUT RESOURCEFULNESS AND OF COURSE YOU ALWAYS DO NEED RESOURCES AS WELL WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING MORE MONEY. BUT THIS REFORM EFFORT AND FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS RATE STUDY AND SEE HOW IN THESE FIRST TWO TWO AND A HALF YEARS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING ADOPTED WHAT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES ARE FOR PEOPLE WHAT IS THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM FAMILIES WATER I THINK THIS IS THE NEXT ISSUE ON THE AGENDA BUT IN TERMS OF SOME THE OVERSIGHT FOR THESE ORIGINAL LETTERMAN -- ACCENTORS DOES ALL NEED TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSED ON THE MONEY WE'RE GONNA BE OBVIOUSLY HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CLOSELY TRACKING THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST AND THAT'S WHAT DROVE SOME THE SUNSETS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THE VICE CHAIR TANG. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN TO THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOU DON'T TRUST THEM THE PROVIDERS -- AND THAT YOU HAVE TO GO DOING GOOD DIG IN A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY'RE SPENDING THIS MONEY -- BUT EFFECTIVELY TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S THERE'S ABUSE I MEAN I AGAIN I THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE FOLKS IN IN IN IN MY DISTRICT PROVIDERS THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR DESPERATE AT THIS AT THIS POINT. AND THAT'S I THINK IS WHY THERE'S A THERE'S A LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AMONGST -- THE LEGISLATURE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE CITY CALIFORNIAN REGARDS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SAYING A NEFF'S ENOUGH WE'VE GOT TO PROPERLY PROPERLY FUND THEM. WELL AGAIN I I DON'T GET WHAT THE HANG UP IS NO I SHOULD CLARIFY WAS NOT SAYING THAT -- WAS FOCUSED MORE ON IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DEALING WITH TRADE OFFS SO IF WE'RE GOING TO INVEST A SET AMOUNT OF MONEY WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OR MORE A THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HAVE PROPOSED POWER WE ALLOCATING THAT MONEY AND WHAT TYPES OF OUTCOMES ARE WE GETTING FOR IT. CENTER FOR LAW AND ORDER. MAYBE I COULD FOLLOW UP ON SEVEN MAYES THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING. WHAT TERM? WHAT ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY DO YOU HAVE? ALTERNATIVE IN THE SENSE OF IF -- REGARDING OUR PROVIDE IF YOU COULD CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT MORE. WHAT IF THESE VENDORS DECIDE? THEY JUST CAN'T DO ANYMORE THEY CAN HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WE CAN'T PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING COMPENSATED PROPERLY. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR PLAN B.? IT'S ALSO VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN OVER JITTERY SO WE'RE GONNA WE KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF IMPLEMENTING THIS RIGHT STUDIES SO WE WILL BE. TRACKING -- THAT FEEDBACK VERY VERY CLOSELY BOTH WITH THE VENDORS THEMSELVES AND WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY -- YOU KNOW WE WILL GET THEIR FEEDBACK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO RESET IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANY DETAIL OF GOD JUST ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS SERVICE IS BEING AN ENTITLEMENT FEAST CONSUMERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE SERVICES. WE ARE SEEN -- EVEN ABSENT THE RATE INCREASES ARE SEEN -- EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN THE SYSTEM EVEN FASTER THAN CASELOAD THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED THE EXPENDITURE GROWS OUT OUT PIECES A CASELOAD SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR AS FAR AS THE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT AS MORE INFORMATION MORE INFORMATION. THAT THE RATE STUDY STARTED HELP HELPING US POINT TO AS FAR AS KIND OF WOOD HOW SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED -- ARE WE WE MAY HAVE A SERVICE CODE ARE WEAK CONSISTENT AND STATEWIDE IN OUR APPROACH AND HOW THAT'S APPLIED SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION FOR THAT -- BUT TO YOUR TO YOUR POINT OF WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS IT'S IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT SERVICE THAT CONSUMERS WILL GET THE WILL GET THE SERVICES AND AND TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ISSUES THOSE ARE ELEVATED TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE ALSO ELEVATED TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND CASES WHERE -- THERE'S ISSUES WITH ANY OF THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED [inaudible] SO. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE THERE'S THERE ON OCCASION SEEMS TO BE AN EMPHASIS TO TRY AND AND AND HIRE MORE STATE EMPLOYEES. IS IS THAT WHERE THIS IS GOING ARE BECAUSE THAT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IF YOU WANT TO START. PAYING STATE WAGES AND PENSIONS AND RETIREE MEDICAL AND SO I I'M I'M I'M IT ME AM I JUST. MAYBE CHECK IN A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ALERT REFERRING BACK TO WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED Là CALLED THE CLOSING THE CLOSURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT CENTERS IN THAT TRANSITION. FROM ONE OF THOSE STATE EMPLOYEES REFERRING -- TO A BILL THAT -- THE CINNAMON. SO YOU'RE JONES DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO HE WAS S. A. B.. ELEVEN FIFTY WANTED TO MAKE EVERYBODY KNOW NONPROFITS AT ALL. IN IN A JUST HAVE EVERYONE BE A STATE EMPLOYEE AND I I'M I'M I'M JUST WANNA USE THAT PLAN B. BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP YOUR COSTS DOWN. SO I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING. TO AND THAT THE FUNDING PROPOSED HERE IS GOING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICES SYSTEM SO THAT HUNDRED MILLION IT GOES TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS. TO THE PROVIDERS WHICH ARE ECONOMIC MIGHT BE NONPROFIT OR PRIVATE BUSINESSES THEY ARE NOT STATE ENTITIES [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THAT'S WEBER. YES I I HOPE YOU -- PROBABLY HEAR THE DEEP DEEP CONCERN AND EVERYONE'S VOICE CONCERNING THIS. AND YOU KNOW I WAS CHAIR BUT GETS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WHEN YOU AND CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET. MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM THE BAY AREA -- AND THAT WE WERE COMING OUT OF A RECESSION AND THEY HAD TAKEN A LOT OF HITS IN THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE SAID. AND AND THEN WE HAD BEGUN TO DO THINGS LIKE. INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THAT THEY'VE HAD TO CONTINUE TO CUT SERVICES THEY'VE GOT SOME. STIPULATIONS ON WHAT HAVING OTHER NOW I COULD GO TO THIS BUDGET AND FIND THE MONEY THAT I NEED ON THINGS THAT I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT. OF TO BE VERY HONEST ABOUT IT AND THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING. AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE NEED TO REASSESS WHETHER NOT THEY'RE PROBABLY USING THE MONEY THAT IT UP THESE FOLKS NEED RACES THEY NEED TO EXPANSION OF STAFF -- THAT'S REAL CLEAR IN TERMS OF YOU EVER GO VISIT THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY DO WITH THESE VARIOUS CENTERS AND THE WORK THAT'S DONE. AND THEY COME HERE EVERY YEAR ASKING US TO BE SENSITIVE. TO WHAT WE HAVE REALLY LAID ON THEM BYE BYE BASICALLY INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE. BOB THEY CONTINUE TO SERVE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WORK WITH -- AND IT JUST SEEMS UNCONSCIONABLE TO METHAT WE WOULD. NOT PRIORITIZE IS MUCH HIGHER. IN OUR OWN THINKING BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS IT'S A MATTER PRIORITIES -- IN YOU KNOW WE WE CAN THROW AROUND THREE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION HERE THREE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THERE WE CAN DO A BILLION WITH SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN FIND ALL THESE THINGS AND THEN WE GET TO THE DDS COMMUNITY. OF IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY. AND THESE PEOPLE ARE PATIENT THEY COME THEY WAIT THEY MEET WITH US EVERY YEAR THEY SAY THE SAME THING. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE IN MEET. AND SO THEN WE END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT TALK ABOUT WELL IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO YOU FOR YOUR TO DO THIS AND SUNSET. DATA REASSESS WHETHER NOT USE THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY BLAH BLAH BLAH. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A STE IT APPEARS TO BE A STALLING TACTIC AND THE IN THAT AND IT'S REALLY DEALING WITH THE THE THE THOSE WHO HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE. GET THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF TASKS THAT THEY DO WHICH IS TAKEN CARE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR SO I FIND IT UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE WOULD EVEN BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE MONEY TO DO WHAT WE KNOW IS RIGHT. CAN I ASSUME THAT WE WOULD DO THAT. HANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE MOST BIGELOW [inaudible] ARE YOU. VERY MUCH JUST A QUESTION I MEAN ARE WERE GOING AROUND THIS ROOM WORLD BATTING. AROUND AT SOME POINT. WE HAVE TO TAKE ON THE ISSUE. WHY NOT TAKE IT ON RIGHT NOW? WHY NOT GIVE DIRECTION AND DIRECTION GOES TO STOP? WHY DON'T WE CHOOSE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS? AND MOVE IT FOR TODAY. I MEAN IF THE CHAIR WAS INTERESTED IN A MOTION WE GIVE THAT DIRECTION. IF THE CHAIR WAS INTERESTED. I WILL BE INTERESTED IN THE MOTION -- EITHER ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY NOW AND I LOOK TO GET IT FROM YOU MISTER BIGELOW I WOULD BE HAPPY TO OFFER THAT MAKE YOU. THANK YOU. BUT HOLD OUT LONGER IF YOU DON'T MIND BUT IF I'M NOT THE ALTERNATIVE. MAY NOT GET IT FROM ALL COME GET YOU I'LL COME GET YOU OKAY. BUT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN PLEASE GOING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY THAT WILL THERE BE WILL SHY AWAY FROM THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE WITH THE BIG A LOT IF JOHN I THINK I BUSINESS SKINNER COULD COME UP WITH AN AXE ABSOLUTELY OF THAT I GET I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF YOUR COLLEAGUES WHO ALREADY SPOKEN EITHER I WILL I WILL SAY IF THERE ARE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- HAVING SHARED SUB THREE A NUMBER OF YEARS -- FULL BUDGET THIS IS. AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- ANA OPINED ON OF FOUGHT OVER ATTEMPTED TO FUND -- WE'VE STEPPED TO THE PLATE AND ANY NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND NOW WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION -- AS WE'VE TRANSITIONED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FROM -- THE THE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM AMILY -- WE WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL ANGLES -- OF THESE ISSUES AND WE HEARD FROM COMMUNITY PROVIDERS FOR MANY YEARS WHO QUESTION WHY WE CONTINUE TO POUR HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO THE CENTERS WHILE WE HAD A PLAN. THE CALLS -- AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE CLOSED WHALE AND THOUGHTFUL -- WHAT WITH TRANSITION PLANSIN PLACE SO THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE? FOR EVERYONE ON THIS DIET AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING -- A SAFETY NET FOR THIS VERY FRAGILE -- COMMUNITY WITHIN OUR BROADER COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN. THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS -- ON AS EVIDENT THAT DIDN'T PUT FORWARD BY. THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO TO DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IS BEST EITHER IN THE SHORT TERM OR THE LONGER TERM. AW AS WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION EARLY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES THIS IS A COMPLICATED COMPLEX. HUGE STATE AGENCY THAT'S GONE THROUGH A NUMBER OF TRANSITIONS JUST SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE WHO HAVE ENOUGH -- TEN YEAR UNDER OUR BELT TO HAVE FOLLOWED THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE THAT THAT YOU ARE AND THEN NEW MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION HERE US LOUD AND CLEAR UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO FOLLOW -- WITH GREAT INTEREST AND ENERGY AS TO WHAT THAT WILL LEAVE THE ADAM OPEN FOR NOW AND LOOK FORWARD -- TO ALL CLOSURE THAT SUITS ALL OF OUR EXPECTATIONS [inaudible] FAIR ENOUGH. THANK YOU SIR TO THE OFFICE. ISSUE FIFTY SIX REGIONAL CENTER TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT TBL. ON THIS ISSUE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENHANCE REGIONAL CENTER AND PROVIDER OVERSIGHT. AND WOULD FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSAL ON RATES -- THE IS SET THE EXCUSE ME THE SENATE ADOPTED PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES. THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SO THE ISSUE IS WHETHER TO APPROVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. AND ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE ABOUT IT IS -- A LARGE SECTION OF THE TRAILER BILL HAS TO DO WITH THE RATE INCREASES PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CHANGE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- SURE YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE TO EITHER CHANGE THE TRAILER BILL OR OR DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I THINK I THINK BASED ON THAT REALITY [inaudible] I YEAH. ON THIS ISSUE -- THE GOVERNOR HAD HAS PROPOSED SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEM OF CRISIS AND SAFETY NET SUPPORTS. THE SENATE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING THE ASSEMBLY ALSO APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING AND IN ADDITION APPROVED FIVE MILLION GENERAL TIME JUST SORRY GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ALSO HAVE A SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES. DIAGNOSIS. FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. IN THE COMMENTS. MOVING ON TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES [inaudible] THIS WAS [inaudible] IT'S THIS. OF HEALTH CARE CENTERS LA YOU KNOW. UNDER CURRENT LAW LICENSE CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE INSPECTED EVERY THREE YEARS HOWEVER IN RESPONSE TO FEDERAL CHOIR MEANT THE STATE IS NOW REQUIRED TO INSPECT LICENSE CHILD CARE FACILITIES EVERY YEAR. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO INCREASE POSITION AUTHORITY TO MEET THIS FEDERAL REQUIREMENT AND THEM BOTH HOUSES APPROVED TO INCREASE THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY. THE ASSEMBLY HOWEVER ALSO PROVE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CHANGE STATE LAW SO THAT IT REFLECTS THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT WHICH WOULD TAKE EFFECT JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU -- COMMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FINANCE FOR THE SENATE ON THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE COMMENTS. THE WHOLE THAT ITEM OPEN. ISSUE FIFTY NINE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. JANIE BELL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM WAS FIRST AUTHORIZED INTO AS PART OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET. IT IS A HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR CHILD WELFARE FAMILIES TO HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND ALSO -- FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS. THE FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM IS SET TO EXPIRE IN JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO THIS MONTH. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SOME REAPPROPRIATION AUTHORITY ALLOWING ON SPENT FUNDING TO BE ROLLED OVER INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THAT. THE ASSEMBLY -- AND THEY BOTH ACTUALLY PER -- PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW IT TO COULD CONTINUE FOR LONGER THE DIFFERENCE REALLY IS JUST THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. THE SENATE APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND BOTH TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS. FINANCE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THEIR REAPPROPRIATION AUTHORITY BUT NOT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS PROPOSED BY THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ISSUE [inaudible] FIFTY NINE HELLO [inaudible] IT -- MISTER CARTY ASK YOUR QUESTION ISSUE. FIFTY EIGHT I JUST THOUGHT JUST A COMMENT THAT -- AS YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR THAT.
