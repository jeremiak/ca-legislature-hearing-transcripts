I'M GONNA TAKE ONE ITEM OUT OF ORDER AND WE'RE GONNA-START WITH ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A- DIFFICULT PROPONENT WHICH I'M SORRY A FORMER COLLEAGUE. AS A WITNESS WHO HAS A VERY DIFFICULT SCHEDULE AND I WANTED TO ACCOMMODATE HIM SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX AND THEN WILL. GO IN ORDER THIS MAIENSCHEIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY AS WELL FOR OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND SPECIFIED COUNTY COUNCILS AND CITY ATTORNEYS TO BRING ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. CURRENT LAW ALSO ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO ISSUE PRE LITIGATION SUBPOENAS FOR DOCUMENTS OR TESTIMONY TO CONFIDENTIALLY INVESTIGATE WHETHER A VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED AUTHORITY TO FILE YOU SEE L. ACTIONS CITY ATTORNEYS AND COUNTY COUNCILS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO FILE PRE LITIGATION SUBPONAS. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX WILL ADDRESS THIS ANOMALY BY PROVIDING THESE COUNTY COUNCILS AND CITY ATTORNEYS THE SAME INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS AS THEIR DISTRICT ATTORNEY COUNTERPARTS FOR UCL ACTIONS. ALLOWING THEM TO SUBPOENA RECORDS AND OTHER NON PUBLIC INFORMATION BEFORE FILING A LAWSUIT. THE BILL WILL BOLSTER CONSUMER PROTECTION AND HELP TO EXPEDITE UCL INVESTIGATIONS AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX ALSO PROVIDES ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO SUBPOENAED ENTITIES. INCLUDING CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS AND THE ABILITY TO CHALLENGE THE SUBPOENA IN COURT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE IS MY FRIEND AND ALL OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE. AT THE CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO DAVID CHIU. WHO I BELIEVE WHO I KNOW WILL TESTIFY NEXT AND THEN IN PERSON I ALSO HAVE MARK AND CORN WHO'S THE SENIOR CHIEF DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. GREAT THANK YOU SO I DO HAVE MISTER TO LISTED ON THE TELEPHONE. WHO ABANDONED THIS COMMITTEE. FEW MONTHS BACK. MISTER CHU ARE YOU WITH US. I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- LET ME FIRST JUST START BY SAYING THE CAN BUT LET THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE FALL READ THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF ARE COLLEAGUES FOR LEADING ONE OF MY ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE COMMITTEES- THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME BACKING FOR YOUR COMPETITION THIS MORNING. I WANNA THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAIENSCHEIN FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX AS HE MENTIONED YEARS AGO THE COMPANY LEGISLATURE WE DECIDED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS BY KNOCKING UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW AN IMPORTANT STATUTE TO COMBAT UNFAIR. UNLAWFUL AND FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE ATTORNEY GENERAL ALL FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN THE CIVIL PUBLIC LAW OFFICES OF THE LARGEST CITIES AND COUNTIES IN OUR STATE FOR ALL VESTED WITH THE SAME STORY TO ENFORCE THE UCL. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE SEVEN DOUBLE PROSECUTORIAL OFFICES THAT HAVE USED THE UCL JUDICIOUSLY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND MANY CONTACTS AT THE AUTHOR STATED WHILE THE H. E. N. D. H. AT OUR OFFICES HAVE THE SAME ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THE SAME INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY TO USE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT US. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY ENSURE THAT ALL ENTITIES AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE THE UCL SHOP TOOLS TO DO SO EFFECTIVELY AT THE MOMENT OUR OFFICE THAT HAVE LITIGATION AS THE ONLY TOOL TO ADDRESS UNDER BUSINESS PRACTICES SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENAS WULD ALLOW US TO GATHER INFORMATION AND DIALOGUE DIRECTLY WITH BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED. THIS WILL HAVE SEVERAL GOOD OUTCOMES FIRST IDENTIFYING BAD ACTORS THE PROFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IT'S IN THE PUBLIC SPAT BEST INTERESTS BOTH CONSUMERS AS WELL AS LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY WILL BENEFIT WHEN BAD ACTORS REQUIRED TO PLAY BY THE RULES THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW WHICH THE SECOND IN ADDITION TO LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. THIS BILL COULD RESULT IN FEWER LAWSUITS SINCE OUR OFFICES WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE SUBJECTS AND REACH EARLIER RESOLUTIONS RENDERING LITIGATION UNNECESSARY. ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA ALL THREE OF THE THAT THIS ARE LAW. IN CLEAR THAT BUSINESS OF LONG JOINED. THEY CALL LOSS. IN MANY INSTANCES WITHOUT HEAT SUBPOENAS J. WOULD BE DELAYED AND IN SOME. JUSTICE WOULD BE TO. I ORDERS IN THE DRAW THE SOME IN THE TO ENSURE ALL CIVIL PROSECUTOR CAN SCAN THE PERFECT PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TO NICE TO HAVE YOUR VOICE BACK IN OUR COMMITTEE ESTIMATES HERE. I THANK YOU AS CHAIRMAN A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARK AND CORN ON THE SENIOR DITCH CHIEF DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. I AM THE HEAD OF OUR OFFICES AFFIRMATIVE CIVIL ENFORCEMENT UNIT. AND HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION CASES. SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARA ELLIOTT ASKED ME TO APPEAR ON HER BEHALF TODAY AND SHE THANKS THIS COMMITTEE FOR ITS ENGAGEMENT ON THESE ISSUES. MY OFFICE IS THE PRINCIPAL CONSUMER PROTECTION AGNCY FOR THE EIGHTH LARGEST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CASES INVOLVE MATTERS OF A STRICTLY LOCAL CONCERN- CARS THAT ARE TOTAL DESPITE BEING LEGALLY PARKED. CONTRACTORS WHO DON'T FINISH THE JOB DESPITE BEING FULLY PAID. AND LANDLORDS WHO SEXUALLY HARASS THEIR TENANTS. MOST OF THE TIME THE HIT A WALL WHERE ADDITIONAL FACTS ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO- AT THAT CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED BY SUBPOENA. ONE MATTER IS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING IS A PRIME EXAMPLE A CONTRACTOR IN OUR AREA HAS BEEN EMPLOYING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. BUT HASN'T PAID THEM THE WAGES THAT THEY'VE EARNED. THEY'VE GIVEN US SOME DETAILS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY RELUCTANT TO MAKES A SWORN STATEMENT OR TO AGREE TO TESTIFY IN COURT. DUE TO THE PRECARIOUS IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE NEED THE BUSINESS RECORDS OF THE CONTRACTOR TO EVALUATE WORK CLAIMS. BUT WE CAN'T GET THE RECORDS THROUGH REGULAR DISCOVERY CHANNEL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROOF TO FILE LAWSUIT. WITHOUT AN ACTIVE LAWSUIT WE CAN'T MAKE A DEMAND FOR DOCUMENTS. A PRE FINDING SUBPOENA WOULD ENABLE US TO SUPPORT OR CONTRADICT THE WORKERS ALLEGATIONS AND CARRY OUT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. WITH WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE HAS CHARGED MY OFFICE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS THE ENVIRONMENT AND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX THIS POINT WE'LL JUST TAKE NAME AFFILIATION AND- SUPPORT THANK YOU.

TO TESTIFY FOR AB. TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX. AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX I HAVE COURTNEY JENSEN. MORNING NOTHING LIKE RUNNING THE COMMITTEE IS SPECIAL ORDER- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COURTNEY JENSEN WITH FERNANDES CERVANTES GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CHSE JACKET AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX. THE BILL SEEKS TO EXTEND THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PRE LITIGATION ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENAS TO FORCE CITY ATTORNEY'S POTENTIALLY INFRINGING ON THE JUDICIAL PROCESS I DO PROCESS RATES OF USINESSES ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA- THE AUTHORITY BEING GRANTED UNDER AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX CAN BE USED AGAINST ANYONE AT ANY TIME FROM THE LARGEST OF CORPORATIONS TO THE MOST STRUGGLING OF NONPROFITS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AS THIS POWER APPLIES BROADLY TO ANY PERSON DEFINED AS ALL NATURAL PERSONS CORPORATIONS FIRMS PARTNERSHIPS JOINT STOCK COMPANIES ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OF PERSONS. THAT'S WILL POTENTIALLY MAKE BUSINESSES VULNERABLE TO BASELESS FISHING EXPEDITIONS AND PUT POLITICAL MANEUVERS FOR NO COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON. WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND WE HAVE PROVIDED THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE WITH AMENDMENT CONCEPTS THAT WOULD RESOLVE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. WE ARE ASKING FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE BUSINESSES WITH THE ABILITY TO FILE AN EARLY MOTION TO QUASH A PRE LITIGATION SUBPOENA. THE FILING OF THE SUBPOENA ALONE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING BUT THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF A SUBPOENA COULD HAVE REAL FINANCIAL. AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES FOR A BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION PUTTING THE PUNISHMENT BEFORE ANY EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT RESPONDED TO BE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT TO QUASH PRE LITIGATION SUBPOENAS COMPLIANCE. RESPECT RESTRICT PRE LITIGATION SUBPOENAS TO DOCUMENT PRODUCTION ONLY SO THE BUSINESSES AND THEIR LEADERSHIP ARE NOT SUBJECTED MY APOLOGIES. ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO UNTOLD HOURS OF DEPOSITIONS THAT ARE COSTLY TIME CONSUMING AND PREMATURELY PUNITIVE. ADDISON SAID AN ANNUAL USE TRACKING SO THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T OF THOR AND A OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW THIS POWER IS BEING USED AND PRACTICE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO AMEND OR WITHDRAW THE POWER IF NEEDED IF NEED BE. REQUIRED THE COORDINATION OF GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO AVOID REDUNDANCY SINCE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL ALREADY HAVE THIS POWER CITY ATTORNEY SHOULD HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH THEM TO PREVENT DUPLICATION. COMPLYINGWITH THESE DEMANDS IS A TIME CONSUMING AND LABOR IS PROCESS CREATING EXORBITANT COSTS FOR RECIPIENTS OF THE SUBPOENAS WITHOUT ANY INSURED BENEFIT TO THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ENSURE THE BUSINESSES ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE AFFORDED FAIR AND RIGHT REASONABLE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS AGAIN WE APPRECIATE. THAT WE ARE. WE APPRECIATE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND AS THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THE BILL BUT TODAY REMAIN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROBERT MUTRIE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN OPPOSITION BUT- INJURING ENGAGEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. I'D SAY NOT OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN ALLIANCE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX AND WILL TAKE NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME WHEN FILED BY ZERO. FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX IN OPPOSITION AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FORTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD AND RESPECTFUL POSITION. FOR ANYBODY ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AND ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE. TWENTY SEVEN YOU ARE OPEN. BY TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. TWENTY SEVEN MARCH RIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. I BET YOU TWENTY SEVEN GO AHEAD. AND THEN WELL YOU KNOW. THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU EMILY DAHLE BEHALF THE COMPANY GRADING THE AND OPPOSE LEFT THAT POSITION THANK YOU. AND THE FINAL REMINDER TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. FOR SURE NOBODY ELSE WAS KILLING UP. I THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHAT ALL RIGHT I THINK MISTER MAIENSCHEIN I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL. TO THE OPPOSITION I PROMISE YOU THE SKY IS NOT FALLING AND- THESE CITY ATTORNEYS I THINK I KNOW ALL OF THEM ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF THEIR POSITION AND THE LAW THEY ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AS OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. I DON'T THINK WE SEEN ABUSIVELY SUBPOENAS I THINK THE BILL IS IN FINE FORM TO MOVE FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND WE DON'T YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE IT UP ONCE WE GET IT MR MAIENSCHEIN YOU MAY CLOSE YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO. THANK AS CITY ATTORNEY DAVID CHIU SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARA ELLIOTT- AND CHIEF DEPUTY. MARK AND CORN FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AND I AND I THINK YOU SAID IT WELL THE SKY ISN'T FALLING AND WE IF THIS WAS HAPPENING WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DA'S RIGHT NOW AND AN AG WHO HAVE THIS POWER AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THE SITUATION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TIMES- WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS ACTUALLY EXONERATE. AT BUSINESSES IN FACT OBVIOUSLY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS REQUIRED UNDER SUBPOENA ARE CONFIDENTIAL. SO I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE IT THAT IN NO WAY ALTERS THE EXISTING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF BUSINESSES ANYBODY SUBJECT TO A SUBPOENA CAN ALWAYS ASK THE COURT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A SUBPOENA THAT REMAINS UNCHANGED SO I BELIEVE THIS IS APPROPRIATE IT PROTECTS CONSUMERS IT PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR THIS COMMITTEE AT TO AN AXE WITH THAT. WHAT'S COMMITTEE HERE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I. RATES NOW BACK IN ORDER THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER WOULD WILL GO TO OUR ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THINK MR STONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE SCENE AND A LARGE-NUMBER OF BILLS WITH SICK ALL THE SUGGESTED. CHANGES TO THE LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT. WHILE WELL INTENDED THESE PROPOSALS TENDED TO ADDRESS SINGLE ACTS ASPECTS OF LPS RATHER THAN A- RATHER THAN AT A BROADER MORE SYSTEMIC. ISSUES OF A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROGRAM THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER HAD A FULL EVALUATION OR REPORT. THAT'S WHY LAST DECEMBER ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY AND HEALTH COMMITTEES CONDUCTED A JOINT HEARING ON THE L. P. S. ACT. AFTER NEARLY NINE HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND DISCUSSION IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS ADDRESSING. MOST ALARMING WAS THE LACK OF CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN SOME BASIC BACK ASPECTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. THESE INCONSISTENCIES RESULT IN PEOPLE BEING DETAINED ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS TREATED DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY RESIDE. WHERE THEY ARE HELD OR HOW THINGS ARE INTERPRETED. THE SECOND MOST ALARMING REVELATION WAS THE ALMOST COMPLETE LACK OF DATA EITHER REAL TIME OR HISTORICAL. HOW CAN A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DATA UPON WHICH TO ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS. HOW CAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON BEHALF OF CITIZENS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE BILL AND DEFINITELY A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT SEEKS TO CLARIFY CERTAIN DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR INVOLUNTARY DETENTIONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. HE CLARIFIES FUNDAMENTAL THINGS SUCH AS WHEN THE CLOCK ACTUALLY BEGINS ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. FROM THE DATA PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE LAID OUT A REPORTING FRAMEWORK CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT DATA SHOULD BE REQUIRED FROM THE COUNTIES. THE FACILITIES THE ONLY OWES AND OTHERS. THE BILL WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE ISN'T THE PANACEA FOR THE L. P. S. ACT. WILL CLARIFY SOME CRITICAL DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS AND INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH ENHANCED DATA COLLECTION. AB TWENTY TWO IS A BEGINNING. ELIGIBLE TO SAY IT'S AN HONOR TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR AS AS A JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL. AND WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE TO SPEAK TODAY- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'RE IF YOU PLAN TO SAY ANYTHING ON THIS MORNING. NO-NO- RESERVE COMMENT FOR A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT THANK YOU THINK BRING THAT IN THIS THANK YOU SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES- TO SPEAK. TO AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE MICHELLE CABRERA WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND DEBORAH ROTH WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND THAT WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PHONE. GREAT THANK YOU. ACTUALLY BOTH LISTED ON TE TELEPHONE MICHELLE CABRERA ARE YOU WITH US YES HI RIGHT HERE. SORRY GIVE HER A PHONE IF THAT. THAT'S THE SORRY FOR THE LAST MINUTE SWITCH UP THEIR CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MICHELLE CAPITA WITH THE COUNTY BE REAL HOPE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CBH DA MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELIVERY AS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY NET PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NEEDS INCLUDING LOCAL OVERSIGHT OF THE LPS FACT. CBH DA HAS A SUPPORT IN CONCEPT ON AB TWO TWO SEVEN FIVE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE LPS ACT STARTING WITH THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN THE FALL AND CULMINATING IN THIS BILL. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR MEMBERS TAKE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER LPS LAW VERY SERIOUSLY OUR MEMBERS UNDERSTAND BOTH THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITIES AFFORDED TO THEM IN DETERMINING WHEN AND HOW TO PUT A PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CAN BE REMOVED. AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN LIFE WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE A RISK TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS DUE TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. WELL COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHO MAY PLACE AND REMOVE HOLDS. ALONG WITH COORDINATION WITH OUR PUBLIC GUARDIANS TO ARRANGE FOR TREATMENT AND SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE SHARE OVERLAPPING ROLES AN RESPONSIBILITIES WITH VARIOUS OTHER ENTITIES AND SYSTEMS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. EXISTING REPORTING STRUCTURES FALL SHORT BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THIS COMPLEXITY NOT ALL LPS ACTIVITIES HAPPEN IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGNATED FACILITIES. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMPEL OUR PARTNERS WHETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS OR HEALTH PLANS TO REPORT TO US SO THAT WE CAN IN TURN PROVIDE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF INVOLUNTARY HOLDS AND TREATMENT TO THE STATE. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT AB TWO TWO SEVEN FIVE PRESENTS FOR US TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN ANSWERING A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT SET OF QUESTIONS. WHO IS PLACED ON HOLD FOR HOW LONG AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BASIC MACRO LEVEL DATA CAN HELP THE STATE TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER AND WHEN INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IS USED AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT MAY BE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. WHILE OUR MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. M. IN PARTICULAR WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO BALANCE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WITH THE PROTECTION OF LIFE FOR OUR CLIENTS- WHEN ALL TOO OFTEN THEIR LIVES HANG IN THE BALANCE OF PROVIDER AVAILABILITY AND WILLINGNESS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR GOALS OF LINE WITH THOSE OF THE AUTHORS IN BALANCING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY ALONG WITH TRYING TO BETTER STANDARDIZE PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. RIGHT OUR NEXT WITNESS IS DEBORAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BROUGHT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT YOU HAVE PUT INTO THIS BILL AND THE VERY LONG HEARING THAT YOU HELD IN DECEMBER. ARE YOUR BILL BUILT ON THAT HEARING AND OUT OF THAT AUDIT REPORT MAKING A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN LANTERN AND PATRICK SHORT ACT REFORMS- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TO PROCESS PROTECTIONS THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES. IS TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN A PERSON IS HELD ON A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. THE CLOCK FOR THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS BEGAN WHEN THE PERSON IS DETAINED. SO IF YOU'RE DETAINED FOR A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD BUT THEN YOU END UP IN A NON COUNTY COUNTY DESIGNATED FACILITY OF THE CARD- MISS CABARRUS REFERENCE BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION- ABOUT- IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A COUNTY DESIGNATED FACILITY AND EVALUATED SO THAT. YOU CAN BE- REALLY A TREAT. AND DISPOSED OF AIM PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE FACILITY TO HAVE THAT COMPLETED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AND WE THINK THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP THERE ARE OTHER OPPOSITION IN THE BILL THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT- AND WE THANK BY WHAT WE WERE. FROM THE HEARING AND FROM THE ARTICLE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME VERY. AMONG CAR. AND EVEN WITHIN INDIVIDUAL. APART IS NOT A CONFLICT. DESIGNATED AND I WAS GOING TO PUT FILL IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY ANSWER ANY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB. TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE. ALL RIGHT SING NINE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO EDUCATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE. AND WILL TAKE NAME AFFILIATION SUPPORTS.

NOBODY IS KILLING UP THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE ALLIANCE I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES AND MISTER WHAT I JUST WANT TO CREATE THE COLLABORATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH OUR TWO COMMITTEES I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY. ASTONISHING AND VERY HELPFUL WITH THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FROM THE HEALTH SIDE AND THEN OF COURSE THE JUDICIARY SIDE WERE WERE. LOOKING OUT FOR THAT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND I DO. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT IMPETUS ACROSS THE BOARD FROM THE CARE COURTS ALL THESE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH. AND YET THE HEARING THAT WE HAD WAS VERY LUMINATE HANG ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE EXISTING LPS SYSTEM. AND IS ORIGINALLY FRAME THE CARE CORPORATE PUZZLE BEING. PUT MORE OF A FRONTEND AND THE LPS SYSTEM BEING AS A BACKSTOP UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO HAVE THIS LEVEL OF INVESTIGATION I THINK RIGHT NOW WITH THE DISCUSSIONS. OF CARE ACCORDING ALL THESE BILLS. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION OF LINES IN HERE WHICH MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE IMPOSING WHAT POTENTIALLY IMPOSING ON COUNTIES AND- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SUBJECT PEOPLE TO AS THEY COME INTO THE SYSTEM SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HOWEVER THIS WORK I DO BELIEVE IT'S ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL. TO GETTING NEXT STEPS DONE AND IT'S JUST BEEN SUCH A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND YOUR EXPERTISE ON IN THIS AREA THAT WE CAN COLLABORATE AND PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT. I HATE TO SAY ANYTHING IS A WORK IN PROGRESS THIS IS CERTAINLY WORTHY OF MOVING OUT OF THE THIS COMMITTEE AND MOVING FORWARD BUT YET THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED THAT I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE AS WE MOVE SOMETHING THROUGH SO I. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK ON HERE. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS REST. I DO% APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA HOW ARE WE GOING TO TRY TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T FULLY EVALUATE I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT D. AND THE BILL YOU HAVE THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS. AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY FOR ANY REFORM TO THE LANDRUM AND PATCHES. SHORT ACT I THINK FINDING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND SOCIETY'S RESPONSIBILITIES. ARE CLEARLY AS THE CHAIR HAS INDICATED THAT THE US IS A STEP. IN IN. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IN THE PROPER DIRECTION AND I DO APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. Q. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS RIGHT SEEING NONE DR WOULD YOU MAY CLOSE YES- AND THANK YOU THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE CHERUB IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU IT'S AT I DON'T RECALL IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE OF A BILL WHERE THAN I COULD I WOULD HAVE REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THE CHAIR OF WHERE WE'VE OUT WITH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE KITTY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JOINT AUTHORED A BILL BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE. AND THE LACK OF FOUNDATIONAL DATA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THE CLARIFICATION OF WIN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY ACTUALLY BEGINS WILL BE A HUGE HUGE HELP FOR EVERYONE THERE'S SUCH SUCH CONFUSION AROUND THAT AND ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHED MY WORK OVER THE YEARS KNOWS THAT DATA IS FOUNDATIONAL TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I DO AND- THIS IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT EFFORT AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORT ASPIRIN I VOTE WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL TAKE IT UP WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. ALL RIGHTS. MR TANG. ALL RIGHT OF NUMBER TWO A. B. FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE ON. ALL THE HELP ON A. B. FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR ESTABLISHES THE FIRE ARMS INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AS WE'VE SEEN A FEW SATURDAYS AGO WE HAD A VERY HORRIFIC. MASS SHOOTING JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE- AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR WE'VE SEEN. AS WE STARTED TO COME OUT THE PANDEMIC A RASH OF MASS SHOOTINGS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY- LONG CALIFORNIA WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON HAVING FAIRLY STRICT. GUN CONTROL LAWS WE'VE DONE BETTER THAN OTHER OTHER STATES BUT STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH- ONE MASS SHOOTINGS ONE MASS SHOOTING TOO MANY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REALLY. THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL CITIES- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF FIRE ARMS VIOLENCE TO REALLY HOLD THE GUN INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE THEY ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRY AS YOU ARE WELL AS THIS COMMITTEES WELL AWARE- THAT HAS COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY PUT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE DAMAGE THAT IS CAUSED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THEIR PRODUCTS- UNFORTUNATELY. THIS LIABILITY HAS A FEDERAL SHIELD- WE BELIEVE THAT AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR COMPLETE LEGAL MODELED AFTER WHAT NEW YORK HAD ALREADY PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW- WE THINK IT PROVIDES A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE POWER BACK IN THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN REALLY. BUT WHAT WE HOPE IS BY HOLDING THIS INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE THAT THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW THEY SELL THEIR WEAPONS- WHAT THEY DO WHEN SOMEONE BUYS A WEAPON THE EDUCATION. ARE REGARDING- SAFELY STORING- SAFELY USING THESE WEAPONS- WE BELIEE THAT THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS TO STEP IT UP AND REALLY BE HELD SIGNIFICANTLY MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE- I THINK IT'S NOT VERY FAIR THAT THE TOY INDUSTRY HAS A LOT MORE LIABILITY THEN THE GOT INDUSTRY. MR THIS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN. MAKE SURE THAT OUR CITIES ARE COMMUNITIES CAN DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER AND THEIR LEGAL POWER. TO HOLD THIS INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE AND KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE WITHOUT RESPECT BASS RIGHT BOTH ON A. B. A. B. FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES- FOR THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE TAKE THE WITNESSES THEIR AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE MOMENTS HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE OVER THE BRIDGE ALL THE HELP THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. A RATES W DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES TANYA SHORT. ARE YOU WITH US ON THE PHONE THE MORNING CARE ACT DOWN AND- YES GOOD MORNING CHAIRED STYLE. AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TONY STARK AND PETER CALDERON DIRECTOR OF STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY OF BRADY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR. AS YOU HAVE HEARD SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PLAQUE THAT FIREARMS MANUFACTURERS AND SELLERS HAVE BEEN AFFORDED SPECIAL PROTECTION. NOT GIVEN THE OTHER INDUSTRIES AFTER SHUTTING OFF AND SHUTTING THE COURTHOUSE DOOR TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED AS A RESULT OF YOUR RESPONSIBLE. NEGLIGENT ARE CHANGES COMING DISTRICT CONTACT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACTIONABLE UNDER CIVIL JUSTICE PRINCIPLES. THESE PROTECTIONS OFTEN RESULT IN THE CLIFF CASES CASES THAT DRAG ON FOR YOUR PENDING APPEAL AND HAVE HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON CASES BROUGHT AGAINST THE GUN INDUSTRY. MOST TROUBLING IT HAS ALLOWED THE INDUSTRY TO PUT PROFITS OVER PEOPLE. AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR RECTIFY THIS INJUSTICE INJUSTICE BY CREATING A LAW THAT WOULD SERVE AS ONE OF THE SIX EXPLICIT EXCEPTION THE FACT THAT. THAT PERMIT CIVIL ACTION ONE COUNTRY MEMBERS KNOWINGLY VIOLATE A STATE OR FEDERAL STATUTE APPLICABLE TO THE SALE OR MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT. AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR CREATE SUCH A STATUTE BY ESTABLISHING A FIREARM INDUSTRY STANDARD OF CONDUCT UNDER WHICH GOT INDUSTRY MEMBERS. WILL BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A BOARD STREET WILL CONTROL TO PREVENT DANGEROUS SALES. AND PROMOTE THEIR WOULD PROHIBIT GUN INDUSTRY MEMBERS FROM CREATING AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF HARM TO THE PUBLIC OR ENGAGING IN OTHER UNFAIR DANGERS BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT. BY CREATING THE POSSIBILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITY AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE CIVIL JUSTICE TO VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS. AND ENTIRE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUT WILL ALSO INCENTIVIZE THE GUN INDUSTRY TO ENGAGE AND REASONABLE AND SAFE BUSINESS PRACTICES. WHICH WILL PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE BEFORE IT HAPPENS AND THE FULL CONTENTS INTO COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY TRAFFICKED FIREARMS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE STRICT LIABILITY OR GUARANTEE IF THEY WROTE JUDGMENT. WILL NOT ALLOW FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TO PROCEED RATHER IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE GUN INDUSTRY TREATED LIKE AND IT'S SUBJECT TO THE MEASURE THAT MECHANISMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AT EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE NO. SHOULD BE A THE LOCK. GUN INDUSTRY NUMBER. IRRESPONSIBLY OVER. MAY THELEMA FIRE. THEY SHOULD BE HOW ACCOUNT. THIS BILL WILL. SURE PASSED IS PART. THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU TO SOME MEMBER AND GENERAL BONTA THEIR STRONG LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL AND TO THE COMMITTEE. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THEN LAUREN LEAP. CHAIR SOON AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS LAUREN LEE AND I'VE BEEN A GRASSROOTS GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACTIVIST FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. I ACTIVISM BEGAN AS IT DOES FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN RESPONSE TO MY FAMILY'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH GUN VIOLENCE. IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE HEAVILY ARMED NEO **** ATTACKED A JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER IN A SUBURB OF LOS ANGELES. BUILDING WITH MULTIPLE PARENTS HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND BEGAN SHOOTING. ESPERANZA BULLETS LASTED LESS THAN A MINUTE DURING WHICH TIME ABOUT SEVENTY ROUNDS WERE FIRED AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE SHOT. ASSEMBLY OF JEWISH ADULTS. INSTEAD HE ENCOUNTERED SMALL CHILDREN WHO WERE ATTENDING SUMMER DAY CAMP. MY SIX YEAR OLD SON WAS ONE OF THE CHILDREN IN THE LINE OF FIRE. IT WAS HIT MULTIPLE TIMES AND MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SON WHAT KIND OF TWO HUNDRED OTHER CHILDREN WHO WITNESS THANK SHOOTER MURDERED JOSEPH ILETO FILIPINO AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS ON HIS ROUTE DELIVERING MAIL. MY SON SURVIVED HIS WOUNDS BUT FOR BOTH OF MY CHILDREN MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY THE EMOTIONAL SCARS WILL LAST A LIFETIME. OUR EXPERIENCE THIS EXPERIENCE IS UNIQUELY AMERICAN. AFTER THE SHOOTING WE JOINED WITH OTHER FAMILIES TO SUE THE GUN MANUFACTURERS THAT ENGAGED IN DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SHOOTER'S FIREARMS. WE FILED OUR SUIT IN TWO THOUSAND BUT THE GUN INDUSTRY FOUGHT US FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT TO STOP THE CASE FROM GOING TO TRIAL. THE SUPREME COURT RULE TO ALLOW THE CASE TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT CONGRESS HAD ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT FIREARM INDUSTRY LAWSUITS LIKE OURS. THAT SAME YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE CONGRESS PASSED THE PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT FOR PLACA. NOT ONLY TO POCKET PROTECTS THE INDUSTRY FROM NEW LAWSUIT. THAT IMPACTED BUT IT IMPACTED CASES LIKE OURS THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN FILED. OKAY SHIELDED AND CONTINUES TO SHIELD BAD ACTORS IN THE GUN INDUSTRY FOR MOST OF TH LAWSUIT AND WAS RETROACTIVE TO OUR STATE WHICH WAS FINALLY TO COME TO TRIAL. JUST LIKE THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WHO ACTED IRRESPONSIBLY OR DANGEROUSLY WERE OFF THE HOOK. MY FAMILY AND OTHER OF THE JCC SHOOTING RAMPAGE NO LONGER HAD RECOURSE THROUGH THE COURTS. CITY WAS IN PURE READING AND UNFAIR IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. OUR NATION IS FOUNDED ON THE BELIEF IN EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW NO AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE COURTHOUSE DOORS SLAMMED IN THEIR FACE BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY THAT HARMS THEM IT'S GIVEN SPECIAL PROTECTION BY CONGRESS.

A FIREARM RELATED PRODUCT THAT IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL REASONABLE RISK OF HARM TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THEY BEGIN TO NINETY FOUR SO BROUGHT ALMOST ANYONE COULD BRING CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE FARM INDUSTRY IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE LAWFUL COMMERCE OF FARM FOR THE INTENT TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF FARMS THIS IS ANOTHER MISGUIDED BILL THAT SEEKS TO SCORCHING DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF THOSE ENGAGE IN LAWFUL COMMERCE. TO RESPECT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS ACCESS TO FARMS AND HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO MISUSE FARMS FARMS ARE NEARLY SHAPE ADAM IT TOOL IS THE OPERATOR THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE UNSAFE EITHER BY NEGLIGENCE MALICIOUS CRIMINAL INTENT WE MUST INSTEAD FOCUS OUR TIME AND RESOURCES ON THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO USE FARMS THE COMMISSION VIOLENT CRIMES. HOUSE SUBSTANTIAL REGIONAL RISK OF HARM TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EVEN DECIDED FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS PROHIBITS MANUFACTURERS FROM BEING SUED THE PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE ACT PROTECTS MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS FROM BEING SUED OF FARMERS USED IN A CRIME THE ACT WAS PASSED BY THE U.

THE RULING TO BUSINESSES IN A STATES BELIEVE ENGAGE COM CANNOT AND SHOULD BE LAW FOR THE- OF WHO HAS. TO OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL AND THE MISUSE OF THE PRODUCT THE RULING STATED. THE POSSIBILITY IMPOSING LIABILITY ENTIRE INDUSTRY FOR THE HARM THAT IS SOLELY CAUSED BY OTHERS SHOULDN'T BE USED TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM.

WHAT'S NEXT TO IMPORTANT GENERAL MOTORS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL INTOXICATED TAKES HUMAN LIFE. PURSUING MANUFACTURE SO IMPORTANT SOMEONE DECIDES TO DIVE INTO THE SHALLOW AND THAT'S NOT INTENDED FOR DIVING.

MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A PRETTY MAKE CLOSE ALLIANCE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SINGH NATT VISITING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I STARTED WITH THE EXAMPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO WE ONLY NEED THAT'S OUR SENSE AFTER MEADOW- IN TERMS OF MASS SHOOTINGS WE ONLY NEED TO GO AROUND THE ROOM VERY QUICKLY TO REMIND OURSELVES OF ALL THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED JUST IN RECENT HISTORY WHAT THE TO SAN JOSE AT MY COLLEAGUES- BTA HEADQUARTERS WITH A MASS SHOOTING WITH THE GUNS AND THE AMMUNITION WERE COMPLETELY OBTAINED LEGALLY. WE HADN'T SAMPOERNA DINO A HORRIFIC WORKPLACE SHOOTING. IN IN SAN FRANCISCO A SHOOTING AT OUR UPS FACILITY THESE WERE ALL FIREARMS THAT WERE OBTAINED LEGALLY FIREARMS ARE DESIGNED TO KILL PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. IT AGAIN WHILE THE OPPOSITION LAID OUT IN LEGALESE A LOT OF- VERY CONVOLUTED MESSAGING HERE'S A SIMPLE FACT. THIS INDUSTRY GETS PROTECTION THAT NO OTHER INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES CATS. THIS THIS BILL WILL JUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE LIKE EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY GUNS ARE NOT CARS. THE PURPOSE OF A GUN IS TO HARM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A CAR WHERE WE'RE USING IT TO TRANSPORT PEOPLE AND IN FACT THIS IS HOLDING THE GUN INDUSTRY TO THE SAME LIABILITY THAT THE AUTO INDUSTRY WHAT HOLE FOR THE TOY INDUSTRY OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE BILL IT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS LIKE MISS LEAPS TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS WHICH IS- WHAT EVERY OTHER AMERICAN AND ANY OTHER INDUSTRY IS ALLOWED TO DO- IT'S A VERY COMMON SENSE BILL TO ALLOW ALSO CITIES TO TAKE ACTION SO THAT MY CITY OR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE OR THE CITY SAMPOERNA DINO OR NOW THE CITY SACRAMENTO. COULD HAVE TAKEN SOME CORRECTIVE ACTION AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IT'S TIME TO ALLOW COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR DOES EXACTLY THAT RESPECT AFTER ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSISTING WE WILL TAKE IT UP ONCE WE HAVE COR THANK. YOU I WILL MOVE TO OUR ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT MISTER SMITH. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE. FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSED. I BELIEVE THIS BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. DOES WHAT'S NEEDED TO HELP CURB THE ILLICIT MARKET IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARGUED THAT A MARKET FOR CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA IS TOO STRONG. THE POTENTIAL PROFITS TO BE MADE OR TWO GREAT. FOR THE PROPOSED FINES IN THIS LEGISLATION TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DENTS IN THE ILLICIT MARKET. HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE MISUNDERSTOOD THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT DOES INCREASE THE COST BURDEN OF FINE SIGNIFICAN GOOD LUCK SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ANY OPERATION THAT CHOOSES TO REMAIN IN NONCOMPLIANCE WILL HAVE TO SHOULDER THOSE COST. HOWEVER THE BILL OFFERS AN AMNESTY PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS A CHANCE TO PAY THE PERMIT FEE. AND THEN COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO FIXING THE PITFALLS OF THE LEGALIZATION AND ENSURE THAT THE LEGAL INDUSTRY CAN THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE PHONE I HAVE BRAD JENSEN WITH THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. FOLLOWED BY LIEUTENANT MARC MOROCCO WITH THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES BRED JENSEN ARE YOU WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. IF I AM GOOD MORNING. I'M BRAD JENSEN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WHICH IS THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY LIKE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE IS STRUGGLING WITH WIDESPREAD ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMING. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE WE HAVE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED ILLEGAL FARMS IN THE MOJAVE DESERT SOME ESTIMATES ARE AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. WE BELIEVE THAT AN INCREASE IN THE FINES FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY WOULD ACT AS BOTH A DETERRENT TO ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND AN INCENTIVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AMENDMENTS TO STREAMLINE THE FINE STRUCTURE WHILE INCLUDING AN AMNESTY PERIOD TO ALLOW THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FIND. TIME TO OBTAIN A PERMIT. PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS IS DETERRING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WHILE STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL MARKET. THERE ARE MANY LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS OWNERS TO OBTAIN PERMITS. FOLLOWED STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND OBEY THE LAW. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT ADVANCE IS A SENSIBLE POLICY THAT WILL SUPPORT LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. WILL HELP DETER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND ENCOURAGE MORE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN. MARK BRACCO. YES GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I MARK BROKEN LIEUTENANT GENERAL COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

I WANTED TO PICK OUT A FEW POINTS THE CURRENT FINE STRUCTURE FOR ILLEGAL CULTIVATION AND NON COMPLIANCE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING THIS PROBLEM- THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET IS SURGING AND HEART COUNTY- SAMBAR DINO. WERE ALSO ORGANIZED SISTER AND BROTHER COUNTIES OF RIVERSIDE AND LOS ANGELES ARE SAYING THE SAME ISSUES- THE WHOLE STATE ARE NOT EVEN- JUST CALIFORNIA. OREGON WASHINGTON OR DEALING WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THESE ILLEGAL CULTIVATION SITES. OTHER INDOOR AND OUTDOOR HAVE MADE IT TO DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS WITH LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS THAT ARE MULTI MONTH THAT DEPARTMENT. ADULT DEPLOYMENT RESOURCE HEAVY- WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING OPERATION HAMMER STRIKE WHICH WAS- SUPPOSED TO BE A TWELVE MONTH OPERATION BUT NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT'S GONNA BE EIGHTEEN. WE ADDED ADDITIONAL- DEPUTIES AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL OVER TWENTY TO THE DIVISION TO DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL CULTIVATION. THAT'S ALL THEY DO FIVE DAYS A WEEK IS HANDLE THE SEARCH WARRANT SERVICE AND DESTRUCTION OF THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS- OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THAT THIS OPERATION'S BEEN GOING WE'VE ALREADY SEIZED OVER ONE MILLION AND PRODUCT- AND A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND POUNDS OF PROCESSED ILLEGAL CANNABIS. AND WE'VE ALREADY CREATED OVER FIVE THOUSAND GREENHOUSE GROWERS- CLOSED ABOUT FIFTY INDOOR GROWS AT RESIDENTIAL SITES- THE TOTAL PRODUCT OVER THIS EIGHT MONTH PROGRAM WE'VE SEIZED IT IS OVER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S AT A WHOLESALE VALUE. NOT EVEN GOING TO WHAT THAT VALUE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT A LEGAL- LOCATION TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AS A RECONFIGURED THE FINES- FOR THESE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES- TO BE FOUR TIMES THE COST OF THE PERMITS IT ALSO PROVIDES SOME AMNESTY BY ALLOWING DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. TO WAIVE FINES IF THE PENALIZED INDIVIDUALS APPLIED- OBTAINS OR COMMERCIAL LICENSING. AND COMPLIES WITH THE LAWS. TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY IT ALSO ACTS GOOD STATE POLICY UNDER THIS BILL THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHRUG OFF FIND IN A WAY THAT THEY DO RIGHT NOW- IT OCCURRED IT WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE LAW- JUST A- COUPLE OTHER AND- NOTES ON THIS- THESE LEGAL SITE FOR OUR DEPUTIES HAVE BEEN SHOT AT- BOTH OF THESE- THREE INCIDENTS TO OF- THE- SUBJECTS CANTONESE GROWS.

B. EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH STRENGTHENS THE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND INVESTIGATION. OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT UNDER TITLE NINE. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THE UNITED STATES PASSED TITLE NINE OF FEDERAL LAW THAT PROHIBITS SEX OR GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT INSTITUTION. MOREOVER IT REQUIRES INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS TO PREVENT SEX BASED DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT ON THEIR CAMPUSES. ACROSS EVERY CAMPUS A TITLE NINE COURTNEY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RECEIVING REPORTS OF AN OVERSEEING INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT STALKING AND ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS. EVEN WITH THE RECENT UPDATES TO TITLE NINE THE PROCESS TO REPORT VIOLATIONS RELIES SOLELY UPON SURVIVORS BILLING BEING WILLING TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE WHICH FOR MANY REPRESENTS A BARRIER TO JUSTICE. IN RECENT YEARS UNITED STATES OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS HAS FIVE CASES PERTAINING TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MIS HANDLING REPORTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND DISCRIMINATION. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION ONLY SEVENTY FIVE OF THOSE CASES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR CREATES A COMPREHENSIVE OVERSIGHT PROCESS OF EMPLOYEES AT PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION IS AWARE OF ANY PENDING OR% COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT WHEN HIRING AN APPLICANT FOR POSITION. MOREOVER REQUIRES INSTITUTIONS TO SHARE RECORDS OF PREVIOUS EMPLOYEES WHO'VE BEEN FORMALLY INVESTIGATED AND FOUND VIA THE TITLE MY PROCESS TO HAVE COMMITTED SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR OF GONE THROUGH THE INFORMAL RESOLUTION PROCESS. FINALLY A. B. EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR ESTABLISHES POSITIONS ON CAMPUSES TO ADVISE AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT ON CAMPUS. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE INTRODUCED AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE WHICH ALLEVIATE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO LIABILITY FOR INSTITUTIONS AND FALSE REPORT OF EMPLOYEES. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR THAT'S FOR FILLS THE INTENT OF TITLE NINE BY STAB WISHING ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND STRENGTHENING SUPPORTS SO SURVIVORS FEEL SAFE TO REPORT INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL LEAD TO A SAFER CAMPUS FOR ALL. THANK YOU SO JUST FOR CLARITY YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS AUTHORS OF THEM I AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT I DO NOT HAVE ANY WITNESSES LISTED.

RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER AUTHORS OTHER THAN FOLKS WERE HERE MISTER LEE ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT ALL RIGHT WE'LL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY FIFTY. HELLO GOOD MORNING MORNING SHARE MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY THIS BILL SEEKS TO PREVENT SPECULATIVE ACTIONS BY REQUIRING A FIVE YEARS OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP BEFORE THE ELLIS ACT CAN BE INVOKED THE ALSO ACT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED TO ALLOW MOM AND POP LANDLORDS LEAVE THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS. WITHOUT SOME THEIR PROPERTY I CREATING A FIVE YEAR HOLDING PERIOD BEFORE THE ELSE THAT CAN BE INVOKED ARBIL CONTINUES TO RESPECT LONG TERM LANDLORDS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR DECADES IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL. FOOTBOARD AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO MOM AND POP LANDLORDS. WHO MAY MANAGE A PROPERTY WITH THE L. C. OR TRUST. THE GOAL OF THIS BILLS TO PREVENT THE ABUSE OF PROPERTY SPECULATOR MOVING FOR BILLION ITS FOR PROFIT. IF AB TWENTY FIFTY SIGNED INTO LAW LATER THIS YEAR ANYONE WHO HAS OWNED THE PROPERTY FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND PRIOR. CAN STILL USE THE ELLIS ACT EXIT RENTAL BUSINESS TOO OFTEN MANY TENANTS IN RENT STABILIZED UNITS LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR THAT THEY'RE BUILDING WILL BE SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. AND BE SUBJECT IN A FICTIONAL AFTER. I THINK THIS BILL WILL A CRUCIAL STABILISING EFFECT WHEN RENTERS WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY- THE WORRY THAT A NEW OWNER IS GOING TO EVICT THEM WITHIN MONTHS OF CLOSING ESCROW. SINCE ANGELES ALONE HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF RENTAL MARKET USING THE ELLIS ACT. DISPLACING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. CONTINUE TO BE SO THEY ALSO ACT DOES NOT PRODUCE HOUSING. THE PRODUCES DISPLACEMENT. AND WORSENS OUR HOUSING CRISIS BY ALLOWING REAL ESTATE SPECULATORS A PROFIT MOTIVE TO REMOVE AFFORDABLE UNITS. FROM FROM THE HOUSING STOCK. DURING OUR PLAN PRESIDENT DOCTOR ARE UNPRECEDENTED UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST INCLUDE DEFENSIVE MEASURES AGAINST DISPLACEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS. THE BILL BEFORE TODAY'S A GUARDRAIL GET SMART ACTIONS AND MORE PEOPLE LOSING THE ROOF OVER THE HEADS. OF STRICTLY AFTER I'VE OPENED TODAY I'M JOINED BY BRIAN AUGUSTA. THE C. R. L. A. FOUNDATION AND ON THE PHONE WITH WILL HAVE ARCHIE SYLVESTER WHO IS IMPACTED RESIDENT OF ELLIS ACT EVICTIONS. THANK YOU THE FIRST WITNESS HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEHIND A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. PART OF A COALITION OF TENANT GROUPS SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. THE AUTHOR IS LAID OUT THE NEED FOR THE BILL VERY WELL I'LL JUST NOTE THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE L. ATTACKED AS ORIGINALLY ENACTED THE PURPOSE WAS TO ALLOW A LANDLORD WHO HAS BEEN IN THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS. TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO EXIT THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS NOTWITHSTANDING LOCAL. LOCALLY ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON GOING OUT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS BY AFFECTING ALL OF THE EXISTING TENANTS THAT IS DISTINCT FROM A. B. SPECULATOR PURCHASES AN ONGOING RENTAL PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY DECLARES THEIR INTENT TO ACCEPT THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET THAT WAS NOT. THE INTENT OF ALICE. THIS BILL PROVIDES A REASONABLE LIMIT ON THAT ACTIVITY. WHILE STILL PRESERVING THE ABILITY OF THE LANDLORDS TO EXIT THE RENTAL MARKET AND WHEN WE- THE DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIOR VERSION OF THIS BILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD WAS THAT IT WOULD IMPACT MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO MAY WANT TO MOVE INTO THE UNITS. THIS BILL NOW ADDRESSES THAT CONCERN AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK IT'S A REASONABLE. CLARIFICATION OF ELLIS THAT WILL PROTECT TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT WE'LL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE A. B. SIXTEEN NINETY MINS RIVAS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU AND THANK YOUR TEAM FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE WITH THE AMENDMENTS AB SIXTEEN NINETY WILL TRANSITION THE SALE OF ALL IN ONE DISPOSABLE VAPE SO WHICH ARE NOT RE CHARGEABLE TO REUSABLE AND RECHARGEABLE NICOTINE PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS THAT THE SINGLE USE PRODUCTS HAVE ON OUR HEALTH AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. ORDING TO THE CDC THE UNITED STATES IS EXPERIENCING AN EPIDEMIC OF LUNG INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH YOUTH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE OF VAPES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OVER STUDENTS REPORTED USING VAPES IN SCHOOLS INCLUDING CLASSROOMS AND BATHROOMS. THE USE OF DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES INCREASED ABOUT A CIGARETTE USERS IN TWENTY TWENTY NICOTINE IS DEEPLY ADDICTIVE NICOTINE ACTUALLY CHANGES ADOLESCENT'S BRAIN CELL ACTIVITY IN THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTENTION LEARNING AND MEMORY AND CAN EVEN WORSEN ANXIETY. ADDITIONALLY THE ERROL SOUL FROM A VAPE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN SAFE STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED LEAD AND VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SOME OF WHICH ARE LINKED TO CANCER. AS VAPE USAGE SURGES IN THE UNITED STATES THEY OFTEN OVERLOOKED FOR THE FIRE DANGER THEY POSE FOR WASTE AND RECYCLING WORKERS ACCORDING TO THE FDA VAPES CAN CATCH ON IRE OR EXPLODE AND SERIOUSLY HURT PEOPLE. A VAPE PENS MAIN SAFETY ISSUE LIES IN THE LITHIUM ION BATTERY IT CONTAINS TO FUEL THE HEATING ELEMENT FOR A MISER. THE SHAPING CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES CAN MAKE THEM BEHAVE LIKE FLAMING ROCKETS WHEN A BATTERY FAILS. BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE AND DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY SIXTEEN HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE SEPARATE INCIDENTS OF EXPLOSION AND FIRE INVOLVING AN ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE WERE REPORTED BY THE U. S. MEDIA. 62% OF THE INCIDENCE OF EXPLOSION AND FIRE INVOLVING AN ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE OR ITS BATTERY OCCURRED WHEN THE DEVICE WAS EITHER IN A POCKET OR ACTIVELY IN USE. ADDITIONALLY VAPES CAN ALSO CONTAIN HEAVY METAL BATTERY ACID NICOTINE AND OTHER HARMFUL CHEMICALS. IT PROBABLY DID BOTH VAPES ARE KNOWN TO LEACH TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT POLLUTE WATER AND HARM WILDLIFE. THE MICRO PLASTICS AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS THAT LEACH FROM THIS BAPE WASTE ACCUMULATES IN THE FOOD CHAIN AND AFFECTS WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING THE HEALTH OF SOILS. CURRENT LAW PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND AB NINE THREE NINE SET OUR WASTE HIERARCHY AT SOURCE REDUCTION FIRST TEN RECYCLING REUSABLE BABES ARE ALREADY WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AND ARE LESS WASTEFUL ALTERNATIVE. AND HIERARCHY BY MOVING AWAY FROM ALL IN ONE DISPOSABLE VAPES THE SMOKING INDUSTRY WILL BE DRIVEN TO TRANSITION THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE LESS WASTEFUL. TODAY I HAVE. MICHAEL DAFT WITH REPUBLIC SERVICES AND JORDAN WELLS FROM THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL SERVICE SERVING AS OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MEMBER RIVAS CHAIR AND MEMBERS USE THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. IT'S THE PERFECT. I AM VERY INVOLVED WITH THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CIRCULAR AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY AND THE SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN NINETY. AB SIXTY NINETY DAYS OUT THE SALE OF WASTEFUL SINGLE USE ALL IN ONE VAPING DEVICES WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF A BATTERY THAT CANNOT BE REMOVED. OR RECHARGE THE ENTIRE UNIT SHOULD BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AT HHW FACILITIES ARE HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES. LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ARE MUCH MORE PRONE TO SPARKING FIRES THAN OTHER HOUSEHOLD BATTERIES AND IT IS ILLEGAL TO DISPOSE OF THEM IN THE TRASH OR RECYCLING WHERE THEY CAN AND DO. CAUSE FIRES THAT CAN RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC AND COSTLY DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HURT PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR WASTE INDUSTRY WORKERS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE A TRUTH IN LABELING PROBLEM MANY NON RECHARGEABLE VAPING DEVICES WE FIND ONLINE LÀ ONLINE OUR LABEL DISPOSABLE WHICH IMPLIES THAT CAN BE DISPOSED OF IN THE TRASH. AND SOME GO BEYOND THAT AND ACTUALLY SAY SOME THINGS LIKE SINGLE USE NO HASSLE OF WORRYING ABOUT CHARGING THE DEVICE OR REFILLING WITH AEGIS AND RECYCLABLE AND ECO FRIENDLY. THIS LEADS TO CONSUMER CONFUSION NEARLY HALF OFALL SIX E. CIGARETTE CONSUMERS ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO PROPERLY DISPOSE OF THEM. 51% OF YOUNG E. CIGARETTE USERS REPORTED DISPOSING OF EMPTY DISPOSABLES IN THE TRASH AND APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FIVE AND A REGULAR RECYCLING BIN. IN VAPING BE A DISPOSABLE PRODUCT IS ON THE RISE. AMONG YOUTH E. CIGARETTES ESPECIALLY THE DISPOSABLES ARE MORE POPULAR THAN ANY TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAPER TO PURCHASE. ABOUT 54% OF YOUTH WHO USE E. CIGARETTES USE DISPOSABLES. ONE IN TEN OF YOUNG E. CIGARETTE USERS REPORTED DISCARDING OF THEIR DISPOSAL DISPOSABLES BY SIMPLY THROWING THEM ON THE GROUND. WHEN ELECTRONIC BEEPING. PRODUCTS ARE IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY MAY LEACH LED KOBOL AND OTHER SUBSTANCES AND TOXIC AMOUNTS. LASTLY TO STATE APPOINTED BODIES HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT CALIFORNIA BANNED THE SALE OF E. CIGARETTES INCLUDING THE STATE WIDE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND THE SIXTEEN MEMBER STATEWIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION WHICH REPRESENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WASTE HAULERS NONPROFITS AND UNIONS. I WANT TO THANK OUR PRINCIPAL AUTHORS CHAIR STONE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THREE OF US SINGH CUDDY PETRIE-NORRIS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE TWENTY CO AUTHORS. WE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE AND THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REMOVE MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION I RISK URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL DAFT WITH THE PAN MCKAY LEE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES A LEADING SOLID WASTE RECYCLING AND COMPOST PROVIDER HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE. REPUBLIC SERVICES WANTS TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AT OUR FACILITIES. AROUND THE STATE AS THE AUTHOR STATED A. B. SIXTEEN NINETY SIX TO LIMIT TOBACCO SINGLE USE PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS WHICH ARE TOO OFTEN DISPOSED OF IN THE TRASH AND END UP IN OUR COLLECTION VEHICLES AND ULTIMATELY THE REPUBLICS BASILIDES. THE IMPACTS OF SINGLE USE PRODUCTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE WASTE AND RECYCLING STREAMS. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. BUT FOR US AT REPUBLIC SERVICES AND OTHER SOLID WASTE COMPANIES THESE ITEMS CAN HAVE OTHER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. IN THE CASE OF THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED IN AB SIXTEEN NINETY SPECIFICALLY THE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. THEY CAN LEAD TO FIRES AND OTHER HAZARDS ARE FACILITIES. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN FIRES IN THE PAST. PRIOR TO THESE PRODUCTS BEING INTRODUCED IN RECENT YEARS THESE NEW SMALLER DIFFICULT IDENTIFY BATTERIES STILL END UP IN OUR WASTE STREAM AND END UP CAUSING FIRES AT MANY OF REPUBLIC SOCIETIES. FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE SIX FIRES ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THE RICHMOND TRANSFER STATION ALONE. REPUBLIC SERVICES BELIEVES THAT THESE SMALL BATTERIES ENTERING THE WASTE STREAM HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN FIRES IN RECENT YEARS. REPUBLICS LOS ANGELES FACILITIES HAVE ALSO REPORTED FIRES CAUSED BY THE HEAT AND PRESSURE FROM THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT GRABBING OR PUSHING A LOAD WITH ONE OF THESE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IN IT. LEADING TO A SPARK OR IGNITION OF A FIRE. THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THESE FACILITIES IS TOP PRIORITY FOR REPUBLIC SERVICES AND PROHIBITING THE SALE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SHIFTING THEM. TO RECHARGEABLE VERSIONS WILL HELP ELIMINATE POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARDS OF THE FACILITIES. BY ENSURING THE SINGLE USE VERSIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT END UP DISPOSING THE WASTE STREAM. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS IN RESPECT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHERS IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT WE WILL NOT TAKE FURTHER TESTIMONY BUT HIS NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT.

AS CHAIR THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO TWO ZERO- THIS IS A BILL TO ESTABLISH A HOMELESS COURT PILOT PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I CAME TO THIS ISSUE THROUGH A CITY A BEAUTIFUL COASTAL CITY IN MY DISTRICT A REDONDO BEACH WHICH HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP AND ESTABLISHING A- HOMELESS COURT THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT- THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND WE HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY FROM. REDONDO BEACH HERE TO SHARE MORE DETAILS IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM BUT- I AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUMMARIZES THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT- IT THERE ARE OVER FOUR HUNDRED. HOMELESS COURTS AND OTHER COLLABORATIVE COURTS THROUGHOUT. POIGNANT BUT THE BASIC CONCEPT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S TO USE A CRIMINAL COURTS NOT OF FOR- CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT ESPECIALLY FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES BUT TO USE IT AS A POINT OF INTERVENTION TO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHETHER IT'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HOUSING JOB TRAINING- TO HELP GET THESE- LOW LEVEL CRIMINAL OFFENDERS BACK ON THEIR FEET- IN ORDER TO- TO- GET THEM OFF THE STREETS- THIS BILL PROPOSES A GRANT PROGRAM TO BE- TO PROMOTE AND SUPPORT HOMELESS COURTS. NOT ONLY AND COMMUNITIES LIKE REDONDO BEACH BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- HERE IN A TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS A MIKE WEBB. THE CITY ATTORNEY OF REDONDO BEACH CORRECT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE WHAT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO- SPEAK BEFORE YOU ON THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT- HELP SET UP THE MOST IMPOVERISHED MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY HELP SET THEM UP FOR SUCCESS. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI MENTION THIS IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM BUT- WHAT- THE TWISTS WE PUT ON IT IS BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC. WE BROUGHT IT OUTDOORS AND WE PRIDE IT OUTDOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN L. A. COUNTY AND BECAUSE THIS IS AN AT RISK POPULATION. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THE BENEFIT IT'S NOT JUST HEALTH RELATED BUT BY BRINGING. THE COURT ROOM BRING IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE THOSE- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ALREADY WORK. IT BECAME A LESS THREATENING MORE INVITING WAY TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE ARE OTHER IN QUICKER WAYS. THE TO GET SOME OF THESE MISDEMEANORS DISMISSED BUT- OVER AT INVITED INTO PROGRAM PARTICIPATE AND ACCEPT SERVICES AND THEY DO SO IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. SO I ADVISE THEM TO DO SO BECAUSE WE BRING ALL THE SERVICES THAT ARE SORELY. LACKING IN SOCIETY IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING ADDICTION DRUG. COUNSELING WE HAVE A SEPARATE NOT JUST THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SAID STAFF THE COURT ROOM BUT A SEPARATE PUBLIC DEFENDER EXPUNGEMENT TEAM WE HAVE- CITY ATTORNEY. PROGRAM FROM LA THAT HELPS THEM- DISMISSED THE CHARGES AND SO IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE SETTING THEM UP FOR SUCCESS BECAUSE HE CAN BE SO HARD TO NAVIGATE ALL THE DIFFERENT- BUREAUCRACIES THAT THEY HAVE TO. NAVIGATE TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR PERMANENT HOUSING AND SO THIS BILL WOULD YOU OUR PROGRAM IS ALREADY BEING COPIED WITH- TO. IN SECOND. L. I. IN TORRANCE OUR BIGGEST NEIGHBORING CITY THIS WOULD PUT A- OF A GRANT PROGRAM A PILOT PROGRAM THROUGH JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO SEE SENATE AND SEE. HOW IT CAN BE. AND TO HELP ADDRESS THIS CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS THAT WE'RE FACING SO I THINK IT'S VERY VERY EXCITING- I WOULD SAY THE ONE THAT THE- IT'S AN EXCELLENT- MARKUP BUT I WOULD POINT OUT. THIS IS AN OUTDOOR COURT ROOM AND YOU WILL GET PUSHED BACK IF THERE IS NOT A PROVISION OF- OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES TO DO SO OURS THAN IT IS IN A PARKING A PARKING LOT- RIGHT NEAR WHERE THEY RECEIVE MEALS. OUT FOR LUNCH AND DINNER WE SET THAT DATE UP DELIBERATELY SO IT'S IMPORTANT THE SHERIFF WOULDN'T AGREE TO IT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE SECURITY WHICH WHAT WE PAY FOR IN THE PILOT PROGRAM WOULD HELP OTHER CITIES TOO. AND THE INTERNET IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IT ALLOWS WALK UPS IT ALLOWS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO AREN'T FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES TO COME IN AND HELP THEIR WARRANTS RECALLED. IN THE COURT CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY CASES UNLESS THEY HAVE THE FILE IN FRONT OF THEM THEY DON'T TRANSPORT IT- THAT TO THE COURT AND SO BUT WE SET UP WIFI SO THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PIECES TO THIS PROGRAM- BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THE MARKET WAS GREAT I THINK- THE NEED. TO MAKE CERTAIN ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES THE GRANT PROVIDES BOTH TRANSITIONAL AND PERMANENT HOUSING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THEM STABILIZE SO THANK WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. IN THE HEARING ROOM IN SUPPORT. THIS IS AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN ALLIANCE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DECADE SUPPORT TO AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WILL REVISE THE COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN PROGRAM KNOWN AS SEA SICK. TO ENSURE BOTH SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING CHILDREN ARE IDENTIFIED SUPPORTED AND PROTECTED. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK. AND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND THE ANALYSIS AND WE AND FOR ACCEPTING THE OFFER AMENDMENTS TO REPLACE REFERENCE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING WITH FORCED LABOR WHICH IS DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE CONSISTENCY WITH THE LAW. THIS IS A PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH THE INTENT OF IDENTIFYING PROVIDING SERVICES TO SAY SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN BY PROVIDING COUNTIES WITH OPTED IN WITH THAT UP TO THE END. TO THE PROGRAM WITH FUNDING AND RESOURCES WITH HIS FUNDING AND WITH THE RESOURCES COUNTIES COULD ESTABLISH. LOCAL TASK FORCES TO DIRECTLY INTERVENE IN CASES OF SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN AND PROVIDE SERVICES. WITH THE C. SECOND PROGRAM. WELL THE SIX THAT PROGRAM HAS WORKED TO PROVIDE SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN WITH ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCES. LABOR TRAFFICKED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MISIDENTIFIED AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN. THIS IS TROUBLING WHEN CONSIDERING THE RESEARCH FROM THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. SUGGEST THAT LABOR TRAFFICKING MAKES UP 39% OF ALL HUMAN TRAFFICKING CALIFORNIA. TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WILL REVISE A C. SEC PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BOTH SEXUAL AND LABOR TRAFFICKED AUTHORIZED A CHILD VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO BE A JUDGE THE DEPEND OF THE JUVENILE COURT. IN CASES WHERE THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN FAILS OR IS UNABLE TO PROTECT THE CHILD FROM BEING EXPLOITED. AND THIRD AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT A SOCIAL WORKER FROM TAKING TEMPORARY CUSTODY OF CHILD VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING IF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN HAD NOT PARTICIPATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE CHILD TRAFFICKING. BY ENSURING THAT THESE MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE LABOR TRAFFICKED CHILDREN WITH THE SAME COURT PROCEDURES SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS. AS SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN. AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TO OUR YOUTH AND RARICK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. AND ADRIANA GRIFFIN. LIVED EXPERIENCE CONSULTANT FOR THE SONY THAT JANE. ANTI TRAFFICKING POLICY INITIATIVE OF LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL. MINNEDOSA FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ETHAN RARICK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION- HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SIX TWO EIGHT TO THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE STATE GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ISSUED A SERIES OF THREE REPORTS EXAMINING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING. A HORRIFIC CRIME THAT EXPLOITS INNOCENT WORKERS TO FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION DURING OUR STUDY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING WE HEARD FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF X. ADVOCATES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND I THINK IMPORTANTLY DIRECTLY FROM THE SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD LABOR TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKERS PREY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US REGARDLESS OF GENDER AGE OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH AS WELL AS FOSTER CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THIS EXPLOITATION. YET CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTIONS FOR LABOR TRAFFIC FOR CHILD VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING ARE THIN IN OUR REPORT ENTITLED LABOR TRAFFICKING STRATEGIES TO UNCOVER THIS HIDDEN CRIME WE FOUND THE PROTECTIONS FOR CHILD VICTIMS FOCUS FAR MORE ON SEX TRAFFICKING COMBATING SEX TRAFFICKING IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND MUST OF COURSE CONTINUE BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE IN OUR COMMISSION'S VIEW THAT WE TARGET LABOR TRAFFICKING. JUST AS AGGRESSIVELY TO ENSURE CHILD VICTIMS OF ALL FORMS OF TRAFFICKING ARE PROTECTED BY STATE LAW THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT LAWMAKERS UPDATE EXISTING LAWS SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED THAT LAWS ADDRESSING HUMAN TRAFFICKING OF COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THUS INCLUDING ENSURING A CONSISTENT RESPONSE. AS YOU KNOW AB TWO SIX TWO EIGHT WOULD CARRY OUT THIS RECOMMENDATION BY REVISING THE COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THIS WOULD INCLUDE VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING I WANT TO THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP.

TRAFFICKING EXPERIENCES OCCUR ON A SPECTRUM AS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SOMEONE CAN EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF HARM. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AS A SURVIVOR AS WELL AS AN ADVOCATE AND PROGRAM SPECIALIST FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY VICTIMIZATION THE LABOR TRAFFICKING I WAS SUBJECTED TO ACTED AS A GATEWAY TO EXPERIENCING SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. I HAD TO STEAL FROM THE MALL. FIGHT OTHER PEOPLE COMMIT FRAUD. IT WAS EVEN COERCED INTO EXPLOITING OTHERS. AT THE TIME I THOUGHT MY BEHAVIORS WERE THE RESULT OF MY OWN CHOICES. BUT LOOKING BACK I REALIZE THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MANIPULATION INVOLVED THAT RISES TO THE ELEMENTS OF FORCE FRAUD AND COERCION. IF MY EXPERIENCE WAS RECOGNIZED AS LABOR EXPLOITATION INSTEAD OF CRIMINALITY. I COULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT I NEEDED. WHICH COULD HAVE HELPED ME AVOID SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB TRAINING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR GROWTH AND HEALING. INSTEAD OF CRIMINALIZING SENT TO PRISON. OUT SIDE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOUTH EXPERIENCING ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S OVER EMPHASIS ON COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN OFTEN YOU ARE MISIDENTIFIED AND NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED. YOUTH WHO ARE BEING EXPLOITED FOR THEIR LABOUR AND NON SEXUAL SERVICES ARE NOT BEING GIVEN THE TOOLS THEY NEED AND ARE RENDERED INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE TO FURTHER EXPLOITATION. INCLUDING SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. THE OPPOSITION BRINGS UP EMPTY SECULAR ARGUMENTS THAT THERE'S NO DATA TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. HOWEVER THERE IS NO DATA TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN MANDATED OR INCENTIVIZED TO COLLECT ANY. CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED SURVIVORS AND EXPLOITED YOUTH BY FAILING TO CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DEVASTATING FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. SURVIVORS MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECTED TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND PREVENT FURTHER EXPLOITATION MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO HELP THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND AND PREVENT TRAFFICKING FROM AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH FOR ALL VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALL LOSE WHEN LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS ARE NOT PROTECTED. I STRONGLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL AND SEND A MESSAGE TO SURVIVORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER LEAVE THEM BEHIND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. READ ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT.

MORNING GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY WHICH WILL CREATE AN OFFICE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FACING A WELL DOCUMENT WELL DOCUMENTED ACCESS TO JUSTICE CRISIS WELL THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD AN ATTORNEY ENJOY THE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM FOR MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. IT'S TOO OFTEN ILLUSORY. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY WOULD ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY BY ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FOCUS ON PROVIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR LOW INCOME AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT WOULD IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF LOCAL LEGAL AID SERVICES PROMOTE COLLABORATION BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES. TRIAGE STATEWIDE CIVIL LEGAL NEEDS AND DEVELOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUES. IN THE FEDERAL EQUIVALENT ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND RECENTLY REESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN THIS OFFICE WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO LEGAL AID SERVICES AND HELP HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN NEED ACROSS OUR STATE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LAUREN KLEIN THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AT THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MR GABRIEL THERE ARE AMENDMENTS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AS AUTHORS YES SIR. THANK YOU FOR THAT. RIGHT I DO HAVE LORING CLAIM LISTED WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU WITH US. I'M HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING TEXT ON A MEMBERSMY NAME IS LAURENKLEIN I AM THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AT THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT A NETWORK OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED STATE FUNDED NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES FREE CIVIL LEGAL ASSISTANCE. AND YOU JUST HEARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL DESCRIBE WE ARE FACING A CRISIS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE HOW MUCH PEOPLE HAVE SERIOUS LEGAL PROBLEMS THEY CAN'T AFFORD LAWYERS AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH FREE LEGAL AID LAWYERS TO HELP THEM. BUT TO ACHIEVE TRUE ACCESS TO JUSTICE WE MUST LOOK FURTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF LAWYERS WE MUST ALSO EXAMINE ARTISTS IN THE COURT THE LAST WEEK PASSED THE WAY THOSE LAWS ARE APPLIED AND THE WAY OUR GOVERNMENT DELIVERS PROGRAM. THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. TO CREATE AN OFFICE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IT'S OFFICE WOULDN'T THE TO. FEDERAL AND VECA. VISION OF ACCESS AND FREE WEIGHTS. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ITSELF. THROUGHOUT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. AND STATEWIDE THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH LEGAL AID. MY ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE STAFF OF THE FEDERAL OFFICE FOR MANY YEARS INDIFFERENT TO MAGNIFY OR REPLICATE SOME OF ITS IMPACT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS SET TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL BLOCK GRANTS. FROM THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT UTILIZED RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE LEGAL INTERVENTION IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR CRIME VICTIMS. TO CONVINCE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO INCORPORATE IT INTO THEIR PROGRAM. ULTIMATELY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH SEVERAL GRANT PROGRAMS. FUNDED SERVICES ACCOUNT THE CRIME VICTIM. ONE CALIFORNIA. A PRO USING CANNABIS TAX REVENUE DOLLARS WITH SIMILARLY AND BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO ENSURE A STABLE LEGAL SYSTEMS GROUP AND CORPORATE IT APPROPRIATELY. IN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED EMERGENCY PROTECTION TO SPEND THE PANDEMIC FIELD HOUSING CRISIS I HAVE WORKED WITH NO LESS THAN THREE STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND PRESERVED AT THE NEW LAW TOOK EFFECT AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE WERE ROLLED OUT. NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOMEONE FACILITATING A FOCUS ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND COLLABORATION WITH LEGAL AID. WELL MY ORGANIZATION HAS CONVINCINGLY PROVE THE CONCEPT THAT WORK IN THE BILL WE ARE FAR FROM ACHIEVING THE VISION THAT AN OFFICE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACCOMPLISH. I THINK THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THE WORK WE HAVE STARTED THE GENOCIDE THAT OPTIMIZE THAT THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT AND A FIRM CALIFORNIA COMMITMENTS TRUE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONTINUED. LEADERSHIP AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANY IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY. THE POOR FOR AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SIGNIN MISTER GARRETT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU JUST WANT TO THANK THE WITNESS- FOR ALL OF THE WORK THEY DO- I THINK AS THOSE OF A OF THE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE RETURNEES ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT OUR LEGAL AID AGENCIES JAIL. TO BRING ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO THE FOREFRONT OF A CONVERSATION ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES I THINK WOULD BENEFIT A LOT OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE WILL TAKE IT UP WHAT'S WE HAVE CORE. THANK YOU. WE SEEM TO HAVE NOT ONLY A DEARTH OF MEMBERS BUT A DEARTH OF. AUTHORS EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE THEIR BILL HEARD TODAY WHO HASN'T BEEN HEARD TODAY. NOW'S YOUR OPPORTUNITY. THE NEW. THERE'S. THIS YEAR OKAY. RIGHT I THINK WHEN WE TAKE ABOUT A FIVE MINUTE RECESS AND THAT'LL GIVE AUTHORS A CHANCE TO GET HERE SO WE'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES. ALL RIGHTS WE ARE BACK WE HAVE AN AUTHOR. SO WE'RE GONNA ROLES WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN MISTER KALRA. THE OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF- WORK WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW IT'S ONE THAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON HER IN IN RECENT YEARS I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE TEN OPPORTUNITY PURCHASE ACT AND COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY PURCHASE ACT. TO GIVE TENANTS AND RESIDENT ORGANIZATIONS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THE RENTAL PROPERTY THEY'LL BE PUT UP FOR SALE. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN THE COSTA HOUSING GO UP IN PRICE AS A RESULT OF REAL ESTATE INVESTORS. BUYING UP PROPERTIES GENTRIFYING NEIGHBORHOODS AND DISPLACING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. UNSUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOMES PURCHASED BY INVESTORS DON'T ALWAYS GO BACK ON THE MARKET AND AFFORDABLE RATE WHICH LEAVES TENANTS WITH EVEN LESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. IN ADDITION AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS NOT DEED RESTRICT IS DISAPPEARING DISAPPEARING FASTER THAN WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR STATE AND IT IS TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL ISSUE. THAT IS CRIPPLING OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN WOULD GIVE TENANTS AND RESIDENT ORGANIZATIONS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY APPROACHING THE RENTAL HOME BEING PUT UP FOR SALE. OR BE ABLE TO MATCH OTHER OFFERS. IN NO CASE WITH THIS BILL REQUIRED OWNER TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY OR RESTRICT THE PRICE AT WHICH THEY CAN SELL IT. BY CREATING A STATE Y. TOPA COPA TENANTS AND RESIDENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN HAVE AFAIR CHANCE TO COMPETE WTH CASH OFFERS FROM THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN DIFFERS FROM ITS PREDECESSORS ARE BY NO LONGER REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE OF TENANT'S PERSONAL INFORMATION. ADDRESSING THE CONCERN FOR THE OPPOSITION. AND TO BE ERY CLEAR THIS BILL EXAMS THE TRANSFER OR SALE THE FAMILY MEMBERS. WE REACH OUT TO OPPOSITION. SEVEN TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION TO WORK WITH THEM. AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN CAN BE AN INSTRUMENTAL PIECE IN ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL HOUSING CRISIS OUR STATE. BY HELPING KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOME. A IN THEIR HOMES AND PRESERVING AT RISK OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING ON THE PRIVATE MARKET WOULD BE TODAY TO TESTIFY SUPPORTERS ANDREAS RAMOS FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ON THE S. ROMMEL'S I SERVICE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR PUBLIC ADVOCATES. WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN A BILL THAT WILL PROTECT TENANTS AND INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOME IS OUR LIVES HAPPENED WHERE RELATIONSHIPS TAKE PLACE AND WHERE FAMILIES THRIVE. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STABLE AND HEALTHY WHEN EVERYONE HAS A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOME. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT PUTS FAMILIES AT RISK DISRUPTS OUR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE STABLE HOUSING INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE STATE'S STOCK OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING ON THE PRIVATE MARKET IS RAPIDLY DWINDLING. THERE ARE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SUCH UNITS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY MAY NOT STAY AFFORDABLE FOR LONG. OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THE BAY AREA LOST OVER THIRTY THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS ANNUALLY. AND OVER TWENTY YEAR PERIOD SAN DIEGO LOS 72% OF ITS HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THESE ISSUES HAVE ONLY BEEN WORSENED BY THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC. AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN WILL HELP ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY CREATING A STATEWIDE TENANT AND COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE POLICY. THAT WILL STABILIZE RENTER HOUSEHOLDS AND INCREASE OUR SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT WILL GIVE TENANTS IN ENTITIES SUCH AS NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS A FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE RENTAL HOUSING WHEN OWNERS CHOOSE TO SELL. THE BILL WILL NOT REQUIRED UNDER TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY OR RESTRICT THE PRICE AT WHICH THEY CAN SELL IT WILL REMAIN AFFORDABLE WITH BUILT IN PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISPLACEMENT OF EXISTING AND NEW TENANTS. THESE KINDS OF RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER POLICIES OFTEN CALLED COPA OR COPA. ALREADY EXIST IN SOME LOOK LOCALITIES SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND WASHINGTON DC. AND A PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE TO COMBAT DISPLACEMENT AND INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. THIS BILL WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES AND BRING THIS PROVEN STRATEGY TO THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP KEEP MORE CALIFORNIANS HOUSE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE HER AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING AGAIN DEBRA CARLTON OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION JUST LIKE BILLS. AND TEN TODAY IN MOST AGO SHE SHOULD YOU HAVE THE BUYER COME TO THE TABLE WITH A PRE APPROVAL LETTER- THEY COME THERE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED BY A BANK OR THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR FUNDING IN PLACE. I THINK THIS BILL AS YOU KNOW CREATES A YEAR LONG EVEN LONGER PROCESS IN WHICH- POTENTIAL BUYERS CAN COME TO THE TABLE FOR US THAT'S JUST VERY UNREALISTIC AND THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MAINTAINING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- EVEN CLASS SAY. HIGH RENT PROPERTIES ALSO WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER TO GIVE A QUALIFIED ENTITIES THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SUBMIT AN OFFER AND YET NOT EVEN UNDER CONTRACT THEY WILL GET ACCESS TO TENANT INFORMATION GRANTED NOT THE SAME AS BEFORE AND NOT SPECIFIC TENANT INFORMATION BUT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS. TO PROVIDE TENANTS INFORMATION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SALE OF THE PROPERTY. THEY WILL NOT- THEY'RE NOT YET SERIOUS BUYERS AND EVEN TENANT ORGANIZATIONS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE TENANTS AT THE PROPERTY. UNFORTUNATELY WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT AN ETHICAL NOT ALL BUT UNETHICAL TENANT ORGANIZATIONS DID CONVINCE TENANTS NOT TO PAY THE RENT EVEN IF THEY COULD THIS WILL CONTINUE IN THE SITUATION KNOWING THAT THE PROPERTY WILL BE SOLD WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT ACCESS THAT WOULD.INTERFERE WITH A POTENTIAL SALE IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE TODAY.

WELCOME GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED BY COMMITTEE STAFF AND- I THANK THEM. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU EVEN NOT BEFORE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND RESULTING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IT WAS GREAT FINANCIAL STRAIN ON MANY SANCTUARY OR RESCUE WILD ANIMAL FACILITIES THE POSSESS WILDLIFE PERMITTED. BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IF THE FACILITY CLOSES HOWEVER THE STATE IS EXPECTED TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE RELOCATION. OF A FACILITIES ANIMALS. ADDITIONALLY AS THE FREQUENCY SCOPE AND BREADTH OF WILDFIRES. INCREASES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. MANY OF THESE FACILITIES. FACE POTENTIAL EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS AND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL PRESSURE. OF UGH AS AN EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO FACILITY- CONDONE AS THE WILDLIFE WAY STATION IN CELLMARK CALIFORNIA NOT TOO FAR FROM MY DISTRICT WHICH COULD NOT RECOVER FINANCIALLY FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CREEK FIRE. HAD TO CLOSE RESULTING IN THE STATE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT STAFFING STRAINS AND FINANCIAL COSTS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ANIMALS HAD TO BE CARED FOR AND PLACED IN THAT SITUATION THE COST TO THE STATE IN ASSISTING WITH. THIS FACILITY CLOSURE ALONE WAS SIGNIFICANT AS THE DEPARTMENT SEES- IN PLACE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ANIMALS THAT WERE HOUSED AT THE WILDLIFE WAY STATION. OF THE DEPARTMENT HAS SPENT APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FACILITY MAINTENANCE DAILY CARE OF THE ANIMALS STAFFING PURCHASING OF FOOD WATER AND EQUIPMENT. SITE SECURITY VETERINARY CARE AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES SO AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FISH AND GAME CODE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF THESE CLOSURES ON THE DEPARTMENT AND STATE. REDUCE REST OF THE PUBLIC NATIVE WILDLIFE AND AGRICULTURE CAUSED BY SOME CAPTIVE WILD ANIMAL ANIMAL SPECIES AND ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT ANIMALS AT THESE FACILITIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY CARE. IT DOES THIS BY MAKING SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FISH AND GAME CODE THAT WILL GIVE CDFW CLEAR AUTHORITY TO LIMIT OR PROHIBIT ANIMALS AND THEIR USES GIVE CDFW THE ABILITY TO REMEDY VIOLATIONS AND GIVES THE DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL ASSURANCE. BY BEING ABLE TO ADJUST EXISTING FEES ALL THESE CHANGES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY PUBLIC PROCESS THROUGH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT. WHERE ACTIVELY WORKING TO WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP- WHICH WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT THESE CONCERNS WITH OPPOSITION. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILLS ABOUT MAKING. EXCUSE ME. MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A SAFETY NET FOR THESE FACILITIES AND THAT THE BURDEN IS NOT SOLELY ON THE STATE THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR- I VOTED TO- I AM AVAILABLE ALONG WITH MIKE A CHIEF OF STAFF.

AT PRESENT MEMBERS IN THAT AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE IN A MORE HANDLING TRAINING AND DRIVING- AND TO THAT END WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THAT BILL IN. TO CREATE A LIST OF ANIMALS THAT COULD NO LONGER BE THAT SLIP IN THE STATE IF AN ANIMAL THAT ONE OF OUR TRAINERS USES END UP ON THAT LET IN. THEIR CULTURE AND DETECTION I IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER BE A MOVIE OR TELEVISION THEY WOULD- YES THIS HAVE TO GO FILM OUT OF STATE SO THAT'S SORT OF THE NEXT. THREAT TO THE WORKER MEMBERS DEAL THAT SAID- WE COMMUTE TO DOCTOR'S OFFICE THAT WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM. ON THE FINANCIAL SOLVENCY PORTION OF THE BILL- ALL OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY IF THEY'RE COMPLIANT WITH ALL. THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL THE USDA CERTIFIED VETERINARIANS FOR OTHER ANIMALS AND ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRING AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN. THE DEPARTMENT AT THE BET I WOULD RECOMMEND CODIFYING BEAST I REQUIREMENTS IN THAT WOULD CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS IDENTIFYING WHO'S A GOOD ACTOR AND HE'S A BAD ACTOR MAKING SURE OUR MEMBERS JOBS ARE PROTECTED. WILL CONTINUE WE'RE WORKING WITH- THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE BUT FOR TODAY WE CONTINUE TO BE A CUT. BACK THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL DO HAVE. LISTED CHASE BRIAN FOR THE SOLAR LIST.

THAT MEASURE MEMBERS- JASON BRYANT ON BEHALF OF THE UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND THE ACCREDITED ZOOS IN CALIFORNIA- THROUGH DISASSOCIATION. WE HAVE A RESPECTFUL OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING FORWARD. YOU KNOW WE SHARE THE AUTHORS GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT ANIMAL FACILITIES ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND. TO ENSURE THAT. WE PREVENT WHAT OCCURRED IT BUT THE WILDLIF PLAYSTATION WHICH IS A NON ACCREDITED FACILITY- BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN- HOWEVER WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT SECTIONS OF THE BILL THAT GIVE THE DEPARTMENT- EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY. TO PROHIBIT EVEN REMOVE THE SPECIES FROM AN ACCREDITED SALE AND WE HAVE CONCERNS BUT THE PROVISIONS THAT IMPOSE THOSE FEES THAT ARE DUPLICATIVE WE THANK AND- AND PERHAPS UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE FINANCIAL STAY. THAT ARE THROUGH CREDIT- AND JUST SPEAKING AB TODAY MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RECEIVED LAST WEEK. YOU KNOW FROM IS A LOGICAL STANDPOINT. THE LANGUAGE APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS OF JUST ONE OF THE TWO MAJORS OF A LOGICAL ACCREDITATION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE. AND I DON'T A CORPORATE MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT THAT- THAT ARE OFFERED THROUGH- MY CLIENTS ACCREDITATION STANDARDS- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE CARE AND WE'RE CONCERNED LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AUTHOR ABOUT. ENSURING THAT WHAT OCCURRED AT THE WILDLIFE WAY STATION DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN- ARE ZOOS HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ACCEPT. A NUMBER OF THE ANIMALS THAT NEEDED CARE AFTER THE CLOSURE OF THAT WILDLIFE WAY STATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE ORANGE COUNTY ZOO WHICH IS A MEMBER OF OUR ASSOCIATION TOOK AN EIGHT ANIMALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THAT HELPED IN AND ASSIST WITH THE CLOSURE OF THAT FACILITY. AND THAT FACILITY ORANGE COUNTY ZOO- WHICH IS ACCREDITED BY THE AA HAS TAKEN IN TWENTY FIVE ANIMALS. FROM THE DEPARTMENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND MANY OF THOSE ALRP STILL HOUSING PROTECTED AT THAT FACILITY TODAY. AT MANY OF THE OTHER THE AGES OF DONE THE SAME- WE ARE ENTRUSTED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE SEASON WELFARE AND MANAGEMENT. AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORK THE AUTHOR. TO ADDRESS THOSE FINANCIAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS- AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT PROCESS. AND HOPING WE CAN GET TO A SOLUTION THAT.

TO RAISE SOME SOME GOOD POINTS. IT MOST OF THOSE ARE REALLY OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE.

EASY TO DO IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT- I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF PASSING THIS COMMITTEE. AT THIS POINT.

AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO PATTERSON HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES FIVE REYES AYE RIVAS. RIVAS I LEE WICKS FIVE WEEKS I. THAT NEEDS ONE MORE SO WE'LL PUT IT ON CALL THANK YOU. RIGHT MS WICKS I REMEMBER FOURTEEN AB. TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN. QUESTION START WITH THAT. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BOTH BE ON THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO PRESENT MY BILL. AB SEVEN AT TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN IS A BILL TO CLOSE SOME LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO. KNOWN BY ITS BILL NUMBERS FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. AB FORTY TWO WAS A LANDMARK BILL THAT I WAS VERY PROUD TO JOIN AUTHOR. IT GAVE EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS PROTECTION AGAINST RENT GOUGING FOR VOTES EVICTIONS. THE BILL WAS HIGHLY NEGOTIATED. AND AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN IS IN NO WAY TRYING TO RE OPEN THE PARAMETERS OF AB FORTY TWO BUT ONLY TO CLOSE SOME LOOPHOLES THAT WE- HAVE SEEN HAPPEN WHICH WE BELIEVE GO AGAINST THE TRUE INTENT OF THE BILL. FORTY TWO INCLUDED EXTREMELY REASONABLE TERMS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO MAKE A DECENT RETURN ON THEIR pTENANTS AT FAULT. A VIOLATION OF THEIR LEASE. ENDS TO CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THE LEASE OF TENANTS WHO ARE ABIDING BY THE RULES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING WHEN THE OWNER WANTED TO DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS. ONE OF ROOM- THEY WANTED TO MOVE THEMSELVES OR A FAMILY MEMBER INTO UNIT TO THEY WANT TO SUBSTANTIALLY. REHAB THE UNIT IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT TEMPORARILY UNINHABITABLE OR THREE THEY WANT TO TAKE THE UNIT COMPLETELY OFF THE RENTAL MARKET. THOSE ARE ALL REASONABLE TERMS BY WHICH TO REMOVE THE TENANT. WHILE THESE NO FAULT CAUSES WERE AGREED TO IS REASONABLE WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE GROUND IS THAT SOME PROPERTY OWNERS ARE EXPLOITING. THESE LOOPHOLES BY TERMINATING TENANCIES FOR THE CAUSES I JUST LISTED BUT NEVER ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE ACTION. THAT IS THEY GET A TENTATIVE ACTED BUT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY MOVE INTO THE UNIT RE RE HAVE THE UNIT- OR TAKE IT OFF THE RENTAL MARKET. IN FACT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SOME SITUATIONS IS MERELY WEEKS AFTER ONE TENANT IS AFFECTED ANOTHER ONE- IS IN THEIR- PLACE PAYING A MUCH HIGHER RENT THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED BY THE ENTIRE AND CATCHING. MEASURE IN AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN WILL PLUG THOSE LOOPHOLES BY REQUIRING PROPERTY OWNERS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE ACTION- THAT WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR REMOVING A TENANT THAT OTHERWISE. NO CAUSE FOR EVICTION. THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND SUPPORTED BY. LEGAL ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. WE KNOW. IT IS OPPOSED BY THE LANDLORD ORGANIZATIONS AND I AM VERY WILLING T WORK WITH THEM A VERY WILLING TO THINK ABOUT. WAYS WE CAN BE IN THE MIDDLE WE CAN COMPROMISE ON SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM AND WORK FOR US- WE WANT TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND AS WE DID FORTY TWO AND I KNOW FORTY TWO WAS. WAS A LANDMARK DEAL AND I DO THINK. YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION THAT IS NOT POSITION TO THIS BILL. REALLY WORKED IN EARNEST IN GOOD FAITH TO GET TO A COMPROMISE ON THAT BILL- AND I RESPECT THAT AND I KNOW THEY WERE VERY. ACTIVE AND WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THAT AND I MY HOPES THEY WILL COME TO THE TABLE IN THIS BILL AS WELL. WE CAN FIND SOME KIND OF A COMPROMISE- HERE TO TESTIFY- WITH ME IN SUPPORT IT'S BRENDA GUEST A- FROM C. R. L. A. FOUNDATION. AND SERRA STEINHEIM FROM THE LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING I AM SERRA ST HAMMERSCHMIDT HOUSING ATTORNEY AT LEGAL SERVICES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND SPECIFICALLY TENANTS IN TWENTY THREE COUNTIES. THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND STABLE HOUSING IS THE NUMBER ONE LEGAL PROBLEM TO CLIENTS CALL US ABOUT IN EVERY COUNTY WE WORK IN. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN BECAUSE IT WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN IN OUR CLIENTS LOSING THEIR HOMES ONCE OF SUCH LOOPHOLE IS WHEN A LANDLORD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION STATING A FAMILY MEMBER INTENDS TO MOVE IN. WE HAVE SEEN CASES WHERE THE TERMINATION WAS BASED ON THESE GROUNDS BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE OWNER. DID NOT INTEND TO LIVE IN TO THE RENTAL HOME AND IN FACT NEVER MOVED IN. IN ONE CASE OUR CLIENT LIVED IN APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH ABOUT THIRTY APARTMENTS. HE RECEIVED A NOTICE STATING A FAMILY MEMBER INTENDED TO MOVED INTO HIS PARTICULAR APARTMENT. THE FAMILY MEMBER WHO ALLEGEDLY PLANNED TO MOVE IN LIVED OUT OF STATE OWNED A HOME IN THAT STATE AND WAS A LICENSED REAL ESTATE AGENT IN THAT STATE. THAT FAMILY MEMBER HAD ACTIVE REAL ESTATE LISTING SUGGESTED THEY CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE STATE. OUR CLIENT DID MOVE OUT THE FAMILY MEMBER CONTINUE TO HAVE ACTIVE REAL ESTATE LISTINGS OUT OF STATE SUGGESTING THEY REMAINED OUT OF STATE. IN ANOTHER CASE OUR CLIENT LIVED IN A SMALL MULTI FAMILY COMPLEX HE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF INTENT. OF OWNER MOVE IN. AND REPORTED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR RECEIVED THE SAME NOTICE. HIS NEIGHBOR THEN MOVED OUT AND HE THEN SAW THE MANAGER. HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE TO RE RENT THE NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN LANDLORDS AND TEA ENTIRE APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND RAISE RENTS AFTER SERVING LONG TIME TENANTS SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION NOTICES. IN ONE RECENT CASE OUR CLIENT WHO IS SENIOR AND A SENIOR AND JUST AND BEDRIDDEN. DUE TO PHYSICAL DISABILITY SPACE THE LOSS OF THE HOME **** RENDON FOR SIX YEARS. THE OWNER GAVE ALL TENANTS IN THE SMALL APARTMENT COMPLEX ASSEMBLY HAD NOTICED THAT SIMPLY SAID THE OWNER WILL BE REMODELING. THE OWNER HAD NOT PULLED ANY PERMITS AND ALL OF OUR INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE ONLY REPAIRS BEING DONE WERE COSMETICS SUCH AS PAINTING. OR OTHER MINOR REPAIRS THAT DID NOT REQUIRE TENANTS TO MOVE OUT. DISCOVERY IN THE CASE CONFIRMED THAT THE TECH THAT THE LANDLORD WAS NOT DOING REPAIRS THAT ROSE TO SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION. HOWEVER ALL TENANTS EXCEPT FOR OUR CLIENT. MOVED OUT AND THOSE VACATED UNITS ARE NOW RENTING THE SUBSTANTIAL RECAP NOTICES. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE TO CLOSE THESE LOOPHOLES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS PLEASE. BY MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIAN AUGUSTA RIGHT. AND MEMBERS PROGRESS WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND SUPPORT- THE AUTHOR IS. LAID OUT THE NEED FOR THE BILL AND I THINK MISTER NUMBERS- EXAMPLES. ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE SEEN. THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS. NOT TO REVISIT THE DEAL THAT ARE- THAT MS WICKS DESCRIBED ESSENTIALLY TO HONOR THAT DEAL AND THE DEAL INCLUDED THAT. AMONG THE REASONS THAT A TENER COULD BE AFFECTED IS FOR WHAT WE CALLED NO FAULT REASONS THE THREE REASONS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS LISTED OUT WHICH INCLUDE. OWNER MOVE IN SUBSTANTIAL REHAB REMOVAL FROM THE RENTAL MARKET BUT IF. OF THE MAILERS GOING TO RELY ON THOSE SPECIES. THAT NEEDS TO BE A REAL BASIS AND THAT. HAS MISSED NINE NUMBERS ILLUSTRATED TOO OFTEN IS NOT THE CASE THE USE THAT NOTICE. TO REMOVE FOLKS AND THEN. NEVER CARRY OUT THE STATED REASON AND SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS PUT SOME TRUTH AROUND THAT IF THAT IS THE STATE A REASON THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY MOVE AND IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STAY REHAB. DONE THAT YOU HAVE THE PER. AND THAT YOU. AND THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN THE REHAB THAT IS REQUIRED THAT MEETS THE STANDARD IN THE BILL- IF YOU'RE REMOVING IT FROM THE RENTAL MARKET EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE INTENDING TO DO IS TO REMOVE. REMOVED PROPERTY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE AGREEMENT. IT HONORS THE AGREEMENT WHICH IS THAT WE RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW TENANTS. TO BE EVICTED FOR NO REASON OR FOREVER FOR A REASON THAT DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD IN THE LAW. AND WE THINK WITH PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WE WILL. ENSURE THAT THAT IS TRUE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WITH ASPIN I THOUGHT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN THE HEARING ROOM IN SUPPORT WE WILL TAKE FURTHER TESTIMONY BUT NAME AFFILIATION THAT SUPPORT PARKS TIRES CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

THE HOUSING IN THEIR FINAL YEARS IT DOESN'T ALLOW A FAMILY MEMBER TO MOVE AND IF ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER ALREADY LIVES IN THE BUILDING. YEAH AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN WAS CRAFTED BY TEN ORGANIZATIONS. THEY HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ATTENDED AND LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT ORGANIZATION CAME TO THE TABLE IN GOOD FAITH I CANNOT OVER ESTIMATE WHAT A BIG DEAL THAT WAS FOR ORGANIZATION TO COME TO THE TABLE AND AGREE TO RENT CAPS. HISTORIC AND WHILE BASIC JUST CAUSE. PROVISIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE LAW IT DID LEAVE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE STRINGENT JUST BECAUSE PROVISIONS. AT THE SAME TIME AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO DID NOT AFFECT COSTA HAWKINS RELL HOUSING ACT. GIVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT MORE STRINGENT RENT CONTROL PROVISIONS. AND FINALLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS YOU HAVE NOT TECHNICALLY BEEN ABLE TO A VIC SOMEBODY. EVEN THOUGH THEY- HAVE NOT PAID THE RENT- AB FORTY NAY TO TRULY HASN'T TAKEN EFFECT IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AT THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AS A RESULT. OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE ADDICTION PROTECTIONS- THAT THIS BILL IS NEEDED- THERE ARE NO LOOPHOLES TO A CLOSE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THEN CREAM THREE C.

BUT ALSO GIVEN THE LANDLORD THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED IF THEY NEED A FAMILY MEMBER TO MOVE AND- YOU KNOW IF THEY WANT TO DO A BIG REHAB PROJECT WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL.
