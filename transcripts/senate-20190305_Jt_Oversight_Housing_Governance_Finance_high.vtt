THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:24.931
AFTER THE SERIES OF MEETINGS IN

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.299
HEARINGS WE POSTED OVER THE LAST

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.534
MANY MONTHS CALIFORNIA IS FACED

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.902
WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.472
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.307

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.842
HIGHLAND PRICES.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:37.343
THE LACK OF HOUSING SOCCER

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.911
ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAN.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:40.913
THE LACK OF ONGOING SUSTAINABLE

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.582
AFFORDABLE HOUSING REVENUE.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.984

OWNING AN INABILITY IN SOME

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:51.357
JURISDICTIONS THE BILL STRATEGIC

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:51.691
INFILL HOUSE.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.226
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.961
TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THE

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.295
SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THAT'S

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.196
FACING US.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.998
AND WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.366
ON THE BUILD OUT OF WORK FORCE

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.001
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN BIG

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.136
CITIES AND SMALL.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.804
THIS IS WHY I FOCUS ON THE ISSUE

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.205
OF AFFORDABLE.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.940
THE TRUE CRISIS EXISTS WITH THE

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:10.209
WORKING POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.744
ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.379
WE'RE SHORT ONE POINT FIVE

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.048
MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.784
ACROSS THE STATE WITHIN THOSE

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.620
THREE AFFORDABLE RINA CATEGORIES.

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.088
EVERY CITY IN COUNTY IN THE

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.891
GOLDEN STATE MUST DO THEIR PART.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.026
AND CANDIDLY THE STRATEGY OF NO

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.394
NO LONGER WORKS.

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.630
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.566
IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.034
HELP YOU STAND STRONG.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.169
THAT'S WHY THE STATE NEEDS TO

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.503
DEVELOP A PERMANENT REVENUE

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.205
SOURCE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.340
COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.608

IN.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.411
I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S GONNA

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:46.679
WE'RE GONNA NEED MEASURES THAT

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.681
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.583
DIFFERENCES OF JURISDICTIONS

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.551
BECAUSE THEY BLANK.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:52.952
BLANK IT ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.321

SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT THE

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:04.824
CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.759
WE WERE CREATED THIRTY YEARS AGO

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.060
BY THE STATE ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.629
RECEIVE ANY ONGOING STATE

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:10.530
FUNDING.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.732
OUR STAFF HAS HELPED PUBLIC AND

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.934
NONPROFIT HOUSING AGENCIES

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:15.968
LEVERAGE EIGHTEEN BILLION

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.638
DOLLARS IN FINANCING AND CREATE

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:19.372
SEVENTY THOUSAND FOUR WILL HOMES

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:20.907
FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.842
WE ALSO PROVIDE RESEARCH AND

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.677
LEADERSHIP ON HOUSING POLICY

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.579
ISSUES.

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:27.647
SO MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.882
FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THAT

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.617
REDLINING RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.886
AND OTHER EXPLICITLY RACIST

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.454
POLICIES IN THE POST WAR ERA

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.023
CREATED AN ENTRENCHED.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.659
RACIALLY SEGREGATED GEOGRAPHY OF

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.527
OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.695
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:43.763
WHERE YOUR RACE DETERMINE THE

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.264
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOU LIVED THE

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.699
FINANCIAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:47.967
YOU?

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.669
AND THE RESOURCES THE HAVE

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.470
ACCESS TO IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:52.705
IN PART OF THE LEGACY OF THESE

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.473
POLICIES HAS BEEN AN UNEVEN

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.842
GEOGRAPHY OF OPPORTUNITY WITHIN

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.710
METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE YOUR

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.178
CHILDHOOD NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYS A

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.646
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:01.614
YOUR LONG TERM ECONOMIC

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:02.748
PROSPECTS.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.851
IN EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS EVEN YOUR

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.419
PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH --

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.020
IN THIS MAP OF LOS ANGELES AND

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.956
ORANGE COUNTY CHILDREN WHO LIVED

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:12.024
IN AREAS SEATED BLUE TENDED TO

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.426
MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER AS

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.760
ADULTS BUT THOSE WHO GREW UP IN

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.295
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SEATED READ DID

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.297
NOT.

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:19.866
WE ALSO KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.200
WE HAVE DONE IN THE BAY AREA AT

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.536
THAT RACE CONTINUES TO PLAY A

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.904
LARGER ROLE THAN INCOME IN

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.339
DETERMINING WHO HAS ACCESS TO

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.740
HIGH RESOURCE HIGH OPPORTUNITY

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.908
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.409
SO LOW INCOME WHITE FAMILIES

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:31.611
ENJOY DECENT ACCESS TO THESE

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.279
TYPES OF NEIGHBORHOODS AS THEY

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.780
SHOULD --

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:35.348
BUT LOW INCOME BLACK AND LET

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:39.252
NEXT DO NOT --

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.019
EVEN HIGHER --

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.254
TO MODERATE TO HIGHER INCOME

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.722
BLACK FAMILIES JUST ARE

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.390
TYPICALLY LIVE IN HIGHER POVERTY

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.758
LOW RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.360
WEATHER PROSPECTS SIMPLY JUST

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.428
AREN'T AS GOOD.

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.464
WE ALSO KNOW FROM SURVEY DATA

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.465
THAT THESE PATTERNS OF

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.133
SEGREGATION DO NOT REFLECT THE

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.102
ACTUAL LOCATION PREFERENCES OF

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.303
PEOPLE OF COLOR --

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.738
DAY TYPICALLY END UP LIVING IN

00:08:58.804 --> 00:08:59.472
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MORE

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:01.107
SEGREGATED THAN WHERE THEY SAY

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.742
THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN WHERE

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:05.444
THEY ACTUALLY SEARCH FOR HOUSING.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.579
IN WHAT WE AT THE CALIFORNIA

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.114
HAVING HOUSING PARTNERSHIP HAVE

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.949
OBSERVED THROUGH A STUDY WITH

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.317
THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.886
AT UC BERKELEY IS THAT SINCE TWO

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.021
THOUSAND AS RENTAL HOUSING

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.489
PRICES HAVE SKYROCKETED.

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:17.657
THIS OLD GEOGRAPHY OF

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:20.226
SEGREGATION IN THE BAY AREA HAS --

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.194
SORT OF RESTRUCTURED AND

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.964
RESHUFFLE BUT NOT BROKEN DOWN ON

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.632
CENSUS DATA SHOWS THAT

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.134
CONCENTRATED INCREASES INDIAN

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.802
DECREASES AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.470
OF COLOR HAPPENED IN CERTAIN

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.139
NEIGHBORHOODS FALL COMPLETELY BY

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.640
PASSING PREDOMINANTLY WHITE.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.108
IN HIGHER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.777
SO THIS PARTICULAR MAP SHOWS.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.645
INCREASES AND DECREASES AND LOW

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.213
INCOME BLACK HOUSEHOLDS PURPLE

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.316
IS A DECREASE GREEN AS AN

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:47.954
INCREASE.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.188
WE ALSO FOUND THAT AT THE

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.222
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL LOW INCOME

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.557
PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE MORE

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.125
VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.393
RENT INCREASES AND WERE

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.695
DISPLACED AT HIGHER RATES.

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.563
SO IN THE FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.665
FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.733
FIFTEEN A 30% RISE IN RENTS AT

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.634
THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL WAS

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.036
ASSOCIATED WITH A 20% DROP IN

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.205
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.807
BUT NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.141
LONGER MIGHT HOUSEHOLDS WHO

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.777
APPEAR TO BE MUCH MORE RESILIENT

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:12.378
TO THE VAGARIES OF THE RENTAL

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.913
MARKET.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.947
DURING THE SAME PERIOD THE

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:16.215
LANDSCAPE OF HIGH POVERTY

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.416
RACIALLY SEGREGATED

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.051
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE REGION ALSO

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.953
SHIFTED INTO NEW PARTS OF THE

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.687
REGION.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:22.788
BUT THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:23.889
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT LOW

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.558
INCOME FAMILIES TYPICALLY FACE

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:26.959
GREATER CHALLENGES --

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:27.693
MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.096
GETTING A CALL.

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.564
IN IN THESE MAPS AREAS THAT

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.100
NEWLY MET THIS DEFINITION IN

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:34.767
TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE SHOWN AND

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.202
CROSS HATCH --

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:37.570
AREAS THAT WERE ALREADY POOR IN

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.038
SEGREGATED IN TWO THOUSAND ARE

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.506
SHOWN IN ORANGE.

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:42.074
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST OF

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.342
THE MAP IS WHITE.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.577
MOST NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE BAY

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.079
AREA ARE NOT CHARACTERIZED BY A

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.115
RACIAL SEGREGATION AND POVERTY

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.951
IT'S A PRETTY RARE PHENOMENON.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.386
BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ONCE

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.121
THIS PLACE LOW INCOME FAMILIES

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.856
OF COLOR OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.791
MOVING TO THESE NEWLY POOR

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.225
ANNUALLY SEGREGATED

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.860
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:01.460
OFTEN ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.461
REGION.

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:03.696
AND ALSO THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:04.997
OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR BLACK AND

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.565
LET NEXT HOUSEHOLDS WERE MUCH

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.600
MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN THESE

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:08.601
NEIGHBORHOODS BEEN LOW INCOME MY

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:09.668
HOUSEHOLD SO.

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.003
IF YOU'RE BLACK AND LOW INCOME

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.905
IN THE BAY AREA YOUR MOM MORE

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.608
THAN LIKELY TO LIVE IN A HIGH

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:16.175
NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU'RE LOW

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.176
INCOME AND WHY.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.879
LESS THAN 10% LIKELIHOOD OF

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:20.346
LIVING IN ONE OF THESE

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.781
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.749
WE ALSO ASKED WHO GETS TO LIVE

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.518
IN HIGH RESOURCE HI OPPORTUNITY

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.585
NEIGHBORHOODS WHOSE

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.120
CHARACTERISTICS ARE MORE

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.455
STRONGLY PREDICTIVE OF UPWARD

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.357
MOBILITY IN GOOD EDUCATIONAL

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.292
OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.894
USER AREAS THAT ARE SHOWN IN THE

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.129
DARKER GREEN COLOR IN THE THREE

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:41.400
COUNTY LEVEL MAPS THE BAY AREA.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.802
AND AGAIN THE RESULTS FALL

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.537
LARGELY FALLEN RACIAL LINES LOW

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.405
INCOME WHITE HOUSEHOLDS ARE

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:48.007
SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.041
IN HIGH RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.409
THAN EVEN MODERATE TO HIGH

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:52.211
INCOME BLACK HOUSEHOLDS SIMILAR

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:54.013
DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITE LATIN

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.714
X. HOUSEHOLDS IN THE BAY AREA.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.650
SO THESE RESULTS ARE WHICH WE

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.784
WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE IN

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.686
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR PART

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.589
OF THE LEGACY OF MORE EXPLICITLY

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.624
RACIST POST WAR --

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.826
HOUSING AND LAND USE PLANNING

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.161
POLICIES THAT LIVE ON TODAY

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.030
JUSTIN RECONFIGURED FORMS --

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.065
THEIR DEEP RACIAL DISPARITIES

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.733
THAT PROBABLY WON'T GET FIXED

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.735
WITHOUT DELIBERATE STATE AND

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:17.870
LOCAL.

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.405
POLICIES IN INVESTMENTS WHICH

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.940
AFFIRMATIVELY HELP LOW INCOME

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:22.074

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.616
RESOURCES ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.118
THERE ARE THREE WAYS THAT --

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.320
AT A HIGH LEVEL THE STATE CAN

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:35.955
TRY TO BRING THIS INTO ACTION

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.556
FIRST CREATE NEW AFFORDABLE

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.325

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:43.696
INCLUSIONARY POLICY.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.664
SECOND STABILIZE HOUSING PRICES

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.137
FASTEST WHICH FOR A LOT OF

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.271
PLACES BUT NOT EVERYWHERE.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:55.107
IN THIRD DIRECT INVESTMENT --

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:04.917
THE VERY FIRST TIME.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:06.118
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT --

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.154
I COMPOSED FOR QUESTIONS ARE

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.989
PASSED ON TO THE NEXT BAKER.

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.258
WHAT DO QUESTIONS AT THE END OF

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:16.729
THE TUNNEL OKAY?

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:27.907
TAKE A MOMENT TO PULL OF MYSELF.

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:28.541
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING

FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:37.950
WITH THE WORK OF THE TURNER

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.696
AFTERNOON TO PRESENT SOME OF THE

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:51.764
FINDINGS OF OUR RECENT

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.232
CALIFORNIA LAND YOU SURVEY.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.633
A SPECIFICALLY REGARDING ZONING

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.269
ISSUES AND OTHER BARRIERS TO

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.372
HOUSING PRODUCTION AND SO --

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:00.906
THE TURNER CENTER LAND USE

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:04.710
SURVEY WAS A MULTI YEAR EFFORTS

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.912
TO CATALOG THE LANDSCAPE.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.581
OF ZONING PRACTICES AND LAND USE

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.949
PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE BY

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.083
SURVEYING LOCAL PLANNING

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.252
DEPARTMENTS ON THE RESULTS FROM

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:14.053
THE SURVEY CAN GIVE US UNIQUE

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.855
INSIGHTS INTO THE VARIOUS.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.324
ZONING ORDINANCES FOR THE

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.858
HOUSING PROGRAMS APPROVAL

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:21.227
PROCESS SEES AND IT'S AN

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.095
OBJECTION POLICIES THAT IS EXIST

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:24.096
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:25.798
AND CAN HELP US IDENTIFY POLICY

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:26.532
BARRIERS THAT HINDER THE

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.835
PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.937
AND SO OUR WORK BILLS OFF

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.139
PREVIOUS SURVEYS THAT EXAMINE

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.941
SIMILAR TOPICS SUCH AS THE

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.010
BROOKINGS RESIDENTIAL LAND USE

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.511
REGULATIONS SURVEY AND THE

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.379
WHARTON.

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.047
LAND USE SURVEY.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:44.149
WE ALSO WORKED WITH H. C. D. TO

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.784
IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE AREAS

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.286
THAT WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.954
AND LINING TO UNDERSTANDING.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.422
LAND USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:52.424
AND OUR SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.559
ONLINE.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:54.960
AND WE RECEIVED RESPONSES

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.929
BETWEEN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.064
AND OCTOBER.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:14:59.898
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS YOU CAN SEE

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.967
HERE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.168
JURISDICTIONS TO PARTNER SURVEY

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:06.605
ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 70% OF THE

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:07.906
STATE'S OVERALL POPULATION.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.775
AND ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.343
FINDINGS REGARDING ZONING FROM

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.545
OUR SERVER WAS JUST THE SHEER

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:14.280
AMOUNT OF LAND.

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.515
THAT ALLOWS FOR SINGLE FAMILY

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.716
HOMES TO BE BUILT.

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.985
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE OVER 70%

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.620
OF ZONE LAND IN CALIFORNIA

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:22.821
ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEY.

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.490
ALLOWS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:27.126
BUILDING WHEREAS ALL OF THE LAND

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.627
IS OWNED FOR MULTI FAMILY.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:29.461
BUILDINGS --

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.964
COMPRISES LESS THAN A QUARTER

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.465
LANDON AND THIS IS NOT JUST --

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.701
CHARACTERISTIC OF SMALLER

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.636
SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.171
FOUND THAT ARE LARGER CITIES

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.773
SUCH AS LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE SAN

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.708
DIEGO THE REPORTED TO US IN IN

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.942
OUR SURVEY THAT.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.778
UNDER A QUARTER OF THEIR LANDS

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.447
ON FOR MULTI FAMILY AS WELL.

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.182
WE ALSO KNOW THAT --

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:51.483
THE TIME IT TAKES TO APPROVE A

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.619
PROJECT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:54.353
FACTOR IN WHETHER NOT HOUSING

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.322
GETS BUILT SO TO THAT END WE

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.390
ALSO ASKED A QUESTION --

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.059
UP TO THE PLANNERS ABOUT HOW

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.327
LONG IT ACTUALLY TAKES HIM TO

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.462
PROVE HOUSING AND BY LARGE WE

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.531
SEE THAT NGUYEN PROJECTS AT HERE

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.700
TO EXISTING REGULATIONS AS

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.168
DETERMINED BY GENERAL PLAN.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.937
OR OR ZONING CITIES MOSTLY CAN

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:13.572
APPROVE PROJECTS WITHIN SIX

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.507
MONTHS HOWEVER AS PROJECTS

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:16.642
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.812
APPROVAL OR REQUEST --

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.780
ZONING VARIANCES --

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.582
AND OR IF THEY REQUIRE

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:24.750
ENVIRONMENT IMPACT PORT PERCY

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:25.884
CLUB.

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.486
THE NUMBER OF CITIES THAT

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:28.320
REPORTED --

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.855
THEIR ABILITY TO APPROVE

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.658
PROJECTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:33.792
ACTUALLY FALLS PRETTY LOW.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.094
AND WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.096
BECAUSE MOST PROJECTS FOR MANY

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.431
PROJECTS TO REQUIRE HE A OURS

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.766
AND MANY OTHER PROJECTS ALSO

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.436
ROUTINELY WILL REQUEST VARIANCES.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:46.338
FOR FOR FOR MANY MANY PURPOSES

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:47.940
TO GET A PROJECT FEASIBILITY.

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:48.974
AND SO TO THAT LAST POINT WE

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.043
ALSO ASKED PLANNERS ABOUT THE

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.212
TYPES OF VARIANCES IN EXCEPTIONS

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.012
THAT THEY SEE.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.448
AND AS ILLUSTRATED HERE YOU CAN

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.449
SEE THAT THINGS LIKESET BACKS

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.450
WANT COVERAGE --

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.786
FAIRLY COMMON FOR BOTH SINGLE

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.554
FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS --

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.956
WE CAN ALSO SEE THAT'S MULTI

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.758
FAMILY PROJECTS --

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:09.094
CAN COMMONLY REQUEST THINGS --

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.898
VARIANCES FOR PARKING HEIGHTS --

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:13.532
RESTRICTIONS AND FOR DENSITY AS

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.634
WELL.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.935
IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:19.104
ZONING WE ASK CITIES WHETHER OR

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.873
NOT THEIR ZONING REGULATIONS

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.174
HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.842
RESTRICTIVE IN THE PAST FIVE

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.310
YEARS.

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:26.745
AND ENCOURAGINGLY.

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.714
OVER 50% SAY THAT TO THERE'S

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.149
ONLY HAS BECOME LESS RESTRICTIVE

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.884
AND ANECDOTALLY THIS SEEMS RIGHT

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.118
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.353
CITIES THAT ARE ACTING

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.654
PRACTICALLY TO TRY.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.923
AND REDUCE BARRIERS --

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.458
TO HOME --

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:40.025
CONSTRUCTION IN THEIR

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.160
COMMUNITIES.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.294
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:43.796
OVER 40% OF COMMUNITIES IS SAY

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.431
THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THE

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.766
LAST FIVE YEARS AND A HANDFUL

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.367
COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY SAY

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.903
THAT THEIR ZONING REGULATIONS

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.238
HAVE BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE.

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:55.107
IN ADDITION.

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:56.074
TO EXISTING PROGRAMS AND

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:57.810
POLICIES THAT CITIES EMPLOY WE

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.812
ASK PLANNERS AS WELL WHAT DID

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:01.513
THEY THINK WERE THE MOST SEVERE

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.582
CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:04.349
CONSTRUCTION IN THEIR

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.651
JURISDICTIONS.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.019
AND THE RESULTS WERE A BIT

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:08.454
SURPRISING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.622
THE CONVERSATION AROUND HOUSING

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:11.690
TENDS TO REVOLVE AROUND THINGS

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.692
LIKE SELLING SEQUEL A FEES

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.960
THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.161
BUT ACCORDING TO THE PLANNERS

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:17.463
WHO RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.730
THOSE ISSUES WERE ACTUALLY RANG

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.232
TO TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OR AS

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.367
OTHER THINGS SUCH AS LAND SUPPLY

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:22.835
PERSONAL CONFIGURATION

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.102
LANDOWNERSHIP --

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.638
WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE AS THE

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:27.873
MOST SEVERE CONSTRAINTS.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.540
AND SO --

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.908
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT THERE WE HAVE

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.343
A LOT OF OTHER INFORMATION WITH

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.645
REGARDS TO FROM HOUSING POLICIES.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.247
AND PROTECTIONS --

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:38.550
AND SO ON SO I IN OUR WORK TO

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.686
VISIT THE PROJECT WEBSITE WHICH

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:41.787
IS CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU SAID ORG.

WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ARE

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.157
DESCRIPTIVE REPORTS AND YOU CAN

LOOK LIKE FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.259
OF OUR STATE --

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.994
WE STAND TO LOSE THE VERY

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.296
COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY HELP

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.831
TO BUILD THIS GREAT STATE OF

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.665
CALIFORNIA.

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.700
IF WE STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.335
NOT TAKE THIS HOUSING CRISIS

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:32.304
SERIOUSLY.

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.805
WITH RAPID JOB GROWTH.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:36.375
GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.677
THE SEVERE UNDER PRODUCTION THAT

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.112
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT --

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:42.648
IN HOUSING ACROSS ALL ECONOMIC

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:45.183
LEVELS IT THREATENS THE VERY

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.119
DIVERSITY OF THIS REGION.

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.654
AND WE MUST ACT NOW.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.789
AND IT TAKES NOT ONLY ACTION BUT

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:51.723
THE POLITICAL WILL TO TAKE

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.593
ACTION.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.694
YOU KNOW I OFTEN AM IN

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.162
CONVERSATION WITH FOLKS ABOUT

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.864
HOUSING AND WE TALK ABOUT IT

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.766
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT OUR

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.501
PROGRESSIVE VALUES.

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:03.669
AROUND INCLUSION IN THE

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.337
CELEBRATION OF THAT DIVERSITY

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:08.507
THAT CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:09.608
BUT IF WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.043
WILLING TO ACT IN SUPPORT

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.145
HOUSING POLICIES THAT FACILITATE

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:14.880
THAT VERY INCLUSION.

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.416
AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RACIALLY

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:18.784
AND ECONOMICALLY INTEGRATED

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.319
COMMUNITIES.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.321
THAT OFFER PROSPERITY FOR ALL

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.156
THEN WE ARE COLLECTIVELY NOT

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.791
DOING OUR JOBS.

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.759
I'M INVOLUNTARY DISPLACEMENT IS

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:28.727
HAPPENING EVERYWHERE IN OUR

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.228
STATE.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:31.530
AND IT'S IT'S SPECIALLY

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.631
HAPPENING FOR LOW INCOME

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:33.932
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS MY

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.500
COLLEAGUES HAVE OUTLINED IN

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:36.835
THEIR PRESENTATIONS.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.170
I WAS A MEMBER OF THE TECHNICAL

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:41.073
COMMITTEE THAT WORKED ON CASA.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:42.507
AND WE PAID A LOT OF ATTENTION

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.343
AROUND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO FOR

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.577
THE TENANTS WHO ARE BEING WHO

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.379
ARE ATRISK OF DISPLACEMENT

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.480
RIGHT NOW.

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:49.781
WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR FOLKS

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.149
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.619
COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE HOUSE

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.287
THE BAY AREA OF THE FUTURE?

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:57.322
SO THE CASA QUE ELEMENTS THAT WE

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:58.957
DESCRIBED AROUND OUR TENANT

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.359
PROTECTIONS --

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.461
ARE JUST TO START AND HOW WE

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.496
THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.498
LEADERSHIP AROUND MAKING SURE

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.033
THAT EXISTING TENANTS AND

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.968
RESIDENTS ARE ABLE TO STAY IN

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.136
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.037
ARE JUST BECAUSE OF DICTION

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.673
POLICY.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.375
A BASE LINE POLICY THAT MANY

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.509
JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.878
ADOPTED THAT WE THINK WILL ALLOW

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.812
FOR THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:21.947
TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.949
THEIR HOMES.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.617
WE TALK ABOUT RENT CAPS WHAT

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.253
HAPPENS WHEN RENTS GO UP 20% IN

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.589
A IN A IN A ONE BEDROOM UNIT IN

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.290
THAT PERSON IS DISPLACED.

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.992
WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.694
WE ALSO TALK ABOUT RENT

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.229
ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO LEGAL

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:38.997
COUNSEL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:40.165
WHEN IT WHEN A PERSON IS

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.567
EXPERIENCING AN EVICTION PROCESS

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.102
TO HAVE ACCESS TO COUNSEL

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:46.004
ACTUALLY PREVENTS THEM FROM

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:47.539
COMING INTO MY PROGRAM WITH THE

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.740
VISIONS ON THE RECORDS.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.175
SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.576
SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.712
DECISION MATERS DECISION MAKERS

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.714
LIKE YOURSELVES CAN TAKE AN OWN

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.049
AND WE KNOW THE PRODUCTION IS

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:58.850
IMPORTANT WE HAVE GOT TO BUILD

00:21:58.917 --> 00:21:59.951
MORE HOUSING.

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.286
BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:02.754
IMPORTANCE OF WRAPPING THAT

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.756
PRODUCTION GOALS AROUND TEN AND

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.391
PROTECTIONS AND PRESERVATION TO

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.660
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.529
STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.431
YOU KNOW LAND USES VERY LOCAL

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.832
AND IT'S PERSONAL FOR A LOT OF

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.333
PEOPLE.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.169
BUT WE CANNOT PROMOTE THE STATUS

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:19.404
QUO I THINK SENATOR YOU TALKED

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.907
ABOUT HOW NO WAS NO LONGER PART

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:24.109
OF THE SOLUTION WE MUST BE ABLE

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.977
TO BE COURAGEOUS AND SAY YES TO

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.612
HOUSING.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.914
EVERYONE IN THIS STATE DOES

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.849
DESERVE AFFORDABLE PLACE THAT

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.718
THEY CAN LIVE.

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:34.653
WE HAVE TO EMBRACE INCLUSIONARY

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.587
ZONING THAT CREATES

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.656
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING TO BE

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:39.991
BUILT NOT ONLY TO ACCOMMODATE

00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:42.561
THE THE FAILURE OF GROWTH.

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:44.029
WELL THE FAILURE OF HOUSING

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.464
PRODUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.199
BUT WE MUST ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:48.734
OUR EXISTING RESIDENTS ARE ABLE

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.169
TO STAY HOUSE.

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.839
THE URGENCY IS REALLY NOW.

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.140
EVERY DAY WHEN I WORK WITH

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.475
FAMILIES IN OUR PROGRAMS

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.110
FAMILIES THAT TAKE THEIR KIDS TO

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.077
SCHOOL EVERY DAY.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:00.612
FAMILIES THAT GO TO WORK EVERY

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.848
DAY AND THEN RETURN HOME TO MY

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.916
SHELTER BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:06.585
HOMELESS IN THE BAY AREA.

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.586
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:09.421
CHANGE.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.822
THESE FAMILIES ARE INCREDIBLY

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:11.890
RESILIENT.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.625
AND THEY'RE ADAPTABLE AND I

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:15.794
ENCOURAGE US ALL AS LEADERS IN

00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:18.463
OUR COMMUNITY TO BE AT LEAST AS

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.599
RESILIENT AS THEY ARE AND MAKE

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.167
DIFFERENT CHOICES AROUND HOUSING

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.369
POLICIES THAT WE NO WORK WE HAVE

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:25.704
THE DATA TO PROVE IT.

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.038
AND WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:29.441
COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:31.910
TO MAKE THOSE THINGS HAPPEN I'M

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:32.511
REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.045

WHICH IS A RESOURCE AND AN

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.127
ADVOCATE FOR FOUR HUNDRED

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:49.594
SEVENTY FIVE CITIES.

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.630
IN OUR STATE THERE REPRESENTING

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:52.631
NEARLY THIRTY THREE MILLION

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.766
CALIFORNIANS.

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.468
EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:57.769
LAWS HAVE CHANGED QUITE

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:00.338
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST TWO

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:02.674
YEARS WITH OVER THIRTY NEW LAWS

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.643
AIMED AT IMPROVING THE LOCAL

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.978
PLANNING AND APPROVAL PROCESS.

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:08.613
HOUSING SUPPLY IN AFFORDABILITY

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.182
REMAIN CRITICAL ISSUES I DON'T

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.050
NEED TO TELL OUR SAY THAT TO

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:13.218
THIS COMMITTEE.

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.820
A NO THAT CITIES ARE COMMITTED

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.087
TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.290
WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO DO OUR

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:21.660
PART TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY.

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:23.328
CITIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.963
THAT WE RECOGNIZE IN THE HOUSING

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.598
PRODUCTION PROCESS BY SETTING

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.533
THE TABLE SO THAT DEVELOPMENT

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.801
CAN HAPPEN.

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:31.036
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.904
PLANNING FOR THE ZONING AND FOR

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.339
THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING PROJECTS

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.042
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE PLANS.

00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:39.411
NOW CITIES DON'T BUILD HOUSES

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.379
BUT WE DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:42.747
ENSURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:44.349
AND APPROVING THE HOUSING OUR

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:45.750
COMMUNITIES NEED WHILE

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.787
MINIMIZING DELAYS COST AND

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.288
BARRIERS TO THAT CONSTRUCTION.

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:51.223
THE PLANNING PROCESS REALLY

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.924
BEGINS WITH THE CREATION OF THE

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.559
CITY'S GENERAL PLAN THIS IS%

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:56.595
REALLY A BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.163
DEVELOPMENT OF ALL KINDS.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.965
AND ANY GOOD PLANNING PROCESS IN

00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:01.433
A COMMUNITY IS ONE THAT IS

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.201
TRANSPARENT AND ONE THAT IS

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:05.337
INCLUSIVE BY DESIGN WITH

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:07.105
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.707
PUBLIC OUR RESIDENTS ARE

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:09.774
BUSINESSES AND OTHER

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:12.677
STAKEHOLDERS. TO PROVIDE INPUT.

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:13.945
THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.147
ASSOCIATED ELEMENTS ARE TRULY A

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:17.849
COMMUNITIES VISION FOR THEIR

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.118
FUTURE AM FOR THE PLACE THAT

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.686
THEY CALL HOME.

00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:23.221
AND IN ANY COMMUNITY.

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:25.090
RESIDENTS FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:26.858
OWNERSHIP OVER THE VISION THEY

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.593
HAVE HELPED CREATE.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.262
AND I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:31.596
AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVING

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.899
THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES THAT WE

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.667
ALL WANT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:37.302
BUT CITIES DON'T PLAN OR ZONE IN

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.104
ISOLATION THE STATE IS AN ACTIVE

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.406
PARTNER WITH CITIES STATE LAW AS

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:42.807
YOU ALL KNOW REQUIRES EACH

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.376
JURISDICTION TO ADOPT A GENERAL

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:44.976
PLAN.

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.412
INCLUDING A HOUSING ELEMENT THE

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.147
STATE MANDATED PROCESS TO PLAN

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:50.715
AND STONE WHERE ALL OF A

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:53.251
JURISDICTIONS NEEDED HOUSING CAN

00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:54.486
ACTUALLY BE BUILT.

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:55.787
THIS INCLUDES ALL TYPES OF

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:57.122
HOUSING AND WE'VE HEARD TODAY

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:59.024
ABOUT THE IMPORTANT NEED FOR THE

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.959
SPECTRUM OF AFFORDABILITY FOR

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:03.528
HOUSING. FOR MORE THAN 90% OF

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:05.397
ALL CITIES HAVE A STATE

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:08.099
CERTIFIED HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.200
AND WE BELIEVE AS A LEADER

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.835
CITIES THAT CITIES SHOULD BE

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.904
MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:15.674
THE LAW TO PLAN FOR HOUSING AND

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.709
WE ARE WORKING WITH CITIES WHO

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:19.110
ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE TO

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:20.512
ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME INTO

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:21.513
COMPLIANCE.

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.114
AND PROVIDE SORT TO THEM AS WE

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.482
CAN.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.951
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:27.552
THAT THERE AE UNIQUE FACTORS

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:28.820
AND SENATOR MCGUIRE CHAIRMAN

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.322
REQUIRE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:32.123
THERE ARE UNIQUE FACTORS IN PLAY

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.558
AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:34.859
BETTER IMPACTING THE PLANNING

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:35.860
PROCESS.

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.829
IT COULD BE A LACK OF FUNDING TO

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:40.231
HAVE THE PLANNERS ON STAFF --

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:43.335
TO FACILITATE THE ALSO BE LOCAL

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:45.170
CITIZEN OPPOSITION OR IN SOME

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:47.572
CASES EVEN LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.874
THAT ARE IMPOSED BY AND PASSED

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.444
BY LOCAL CITIZENS WE APPRECIATE

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.745
IT AT LEAST FOR THOSE CITIES WHO

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.947
ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.349
STATE LAW WE APPRECIATE THE

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.283
ADMINISTRATION.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.018
MEETING WITH THEM RECENTLY AND

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:01.953
REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.655
WE CAN HELP THEM GET INTO

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.724
COMPLIANCE. ONE QUESTION I'M

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.092
OFTEN ASKED I THINK AN EARLIER

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:08.760
SPEAKER REFERENCE THIS IT HAD TO

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.562
DO WITH LAND I'M ASKED WE HAVE

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.597
ENOUGH LAND ZONED TO MEET OUR

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:13.665
HOUSING NEEDS.

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.533
WHEN THE RESEARCH BY UCLA'S

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.969
LUSKIN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:19.938
REPORTS THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.539
HAVE ZONE TO LAND FOR THE

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:25.477
CONSTRUCTION OF TWO POINT EIGHT

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:26.378
MILLION HOMES?

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:27.112
THIS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.880
CONTEXT HOME BUILDERS HAVE

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:31.816
PRODUCED AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:32.684
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:35.754
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.089
BY MY MATH THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.392
HAS ROUGHLY TWENTY EIGHT TIMES

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:42.060
THE AMOUNT OF LAND ZONE FOR

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:42.794
HOUSING.

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:45.096
DâN IS BEING PRODUCED IN ANY

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.798
GIVEN YEAR.

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:48.366
ADDITIONALLY A TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:50.235
REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:52.370
ECONOMIC FORECAST LISTED MORE

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.806
THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:55.507
THOUSAND NEW HOMES.

00:27:55.573 --> 00:27:57.909
ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR PROVED

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.744
TO BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BUT

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.379
BECAUSE OF FACTORS BEYOND THE

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:02.781
CONTROL OF CITIES AND LOCAL

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:04.282
GOVERNMENTS THESE HOMES WILL

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.851
ACTUALLY NOT BE BILLED FOR AT

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:09.187
LEAST FIVE YEARS.

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:10.355
IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THE LEAGUE

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:12.190
IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED PASSAGE OF

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:13.491
LEGISLATION.

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:14.692
THAT STREAMLINES THE HOUSING

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.528
APPROVAL PROCESS THIS INCLUDES

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:19.230
SB FIVE FORTY IT ALSO INCLUDES

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:20.899
AB.

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:21.533
SEVENTY THREE THESE BILLS WHICH

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.201
ARE NOW LAW ARE STILL IN THEIR

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:25.236
INFANCY BUT WE'RE WORKING TO GET

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:26.471
THEM IMPLEMENTED.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.806
THE LEAGUE ALSO SUPPORTED THE

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.774
PASSAGE OF PROPS ONE AND TWO

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:31.276
WHICH MEANS CITIES WILL FINALLY

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:33.278
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HELP FIND

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:34.446
THE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:36.414
HOUSING AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.582
IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH YOU

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:38.116
HEARD ABOUT.

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:39.918
EARLIER AND ADDITIONALLY WITH

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.753
THE WALKING OF A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.388
MILLION DOLLARS NEXT MONTH FROM

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.023
SB TWO FUNDS THANK MANY OF YOU

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:45.824
FOR THAT.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.358
A CITIES WILL HAVE GREATER

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:50.295
RESOURCES TO SOURCES TO

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:51.830
STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL PROCESS

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.832
TO ACTUALLY UPDATE OUR LAND USE

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:56.868
PLANS AND ZONE OR TO REZONE TO

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:59.070
MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.572
CITY IS WANT TO BE PARTNERS WITH

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:02.540
THE STATE TO ACHIEVE OUR MUTUAL

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:05.009
HOUSING GOALS WE SUPPORT A

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.377
COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.179
WHERE THE STATE SETS GOALS AND

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.415
PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR CITIES

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:12.684
THROUGH FUNDING AND PERHAPS A

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.185
TAX INCREMENTS.

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.787
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT FIRMLY

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.522
AND ULTIMATELY.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:18.957
THAT THE AUTHORITY THE PLAN FOR

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.825
AND HIS OWN AND APPROVE HOUSING

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.827
RIGHTFULLY BELONGS IN THE HANDS

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.496
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.197
CLOSER TO THE GROUND AND CAN

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.199
REFLECT THE INTEREST.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.701
OF THOSE WHO LIVE THERE.

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:30.902
AND WE KNOW THAT THE VOTERS

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:34.839
SUPPORT THAT PRINCIPLE AS WELL.

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:35.640
I WANT IN MY REMARKS WERE

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:37.075
TALKING A LITTLE BIT --

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:39.110
ABOUT WHAT WHAT CITY SUPPORT AS

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:40.545
A PART OF THIS LARGER

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.180
CONVERSATION WE ARE HAVING.

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.748
BESIDES THE RESOURCES IN THE

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:45.450
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'RE ALSO

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:47.185
SUPPORTING WAYS THE STATE CAN

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.387
REDUCE LOCAL BARRIERS TO HOUSING

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.689
LIKE SOME FORM A SEQUEL REFORM.

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.458
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.926
SUSTAINABLE HOUSING INVESTMENT

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.195
PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.630
SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE --

00:29:58.696 --> 00:29:59.831
CHAIRMAN REQUIRES AND SENATOR

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.733
BELLS A LEADERSHIP AND JUMP

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.301
STARTING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:06.137
NEW FORM OF TAX INCREMENTAL

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.438
FINANCING.

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.673
WE ALSO SUPPORT LOOKING AT

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.175
BUILDING FEES IF THERE ARE

00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:12.110
BETTER WAYS TO FUND THE SERVICES

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:13.912
AND AMENITIES THAT THESE THESE

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:15.146
PAY.

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.314
FOR THE LEAGUE IS OPEN TO HAVING

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.516
THAT COMFORTED CONVERSATION.

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.084
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.953
SOMEHOW REDUCE THAT WE SHOULD

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.355
MAKE SURE THEIR SAVINGS ARE

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.757
PASSED ALONG TO THE BUYER.

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.358
WE ALSO SUPPORT REASONABLE

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.993
ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS AND

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.895
PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND BELIEVE

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:33.198
THAT NEW SUBDIVISIONS PLANNED BY

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.799
CITIES AND DEVELOPERS SHOULD

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.301
INCLUDE ZONING FOR MULTI FAMILY

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:39.404
UNITS AND ACCESS FOR HOME BUYERS

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.905
IN ALL INCOME RANGES.

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.440
AND FINALLY THE LEAGUE SUPPORTS

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.509
CITIES RECEIVING THE NEW

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.277
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT WE

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.846
PROMISED TO VOTERS THAT THEY

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:51.015
WOULD GET UNDER SB.

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:51.749
ONE I WANT TO CLOSE MY REMARKS

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.451

MUST FIRST REBUILD OUR

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:08.266
NEIGHBORHOODS.

HOMES THAT YOU'VE CREATED ARE

SOME THIRTY ONE YEARS.

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:43.901
NOT ME BUT YS --

00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:46.437
I THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:47.038
HUNDRED UNITS A YEAR I'M JUST

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.072
CURIOUS.

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:48.940
WHAT IS YOUR BEEN YOUR YEAR BY

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:51.576
YEAR --

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.611
RESULTS I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:56.147
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I THINK --

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.482
AS THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.017
CREDIT PROGRAM HAS GROWN OVER

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.051
TIME.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.452
AND BECOME MORE --

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.254
THE MAINSTAY FUNDING SOURCE FOR

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.589
ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:04.922
PRODUCTION --

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.090
PRESERVATION THE STATE.

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:07.725
AND AS THE INDUSTRY HAS GROWN

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:09.627
AROUND THAT OUR STAFF IN OUR

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:11.696
ABILITY TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.031
LOCAL AGENCIES BUILD HOUSING IS

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.399
GROWING OVER TIME SO IT'S LIKE

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:14.932
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY STEADY

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:15.900
INCREASE --

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.435
THERE CERTAINLY WAS A DROP OFF

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.037
IN THE RECESSION BUT IT'S

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.571
BASICALLY BASED ON THE

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:23.708
AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES --

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.877
SO YOU KNOW WE OUR OUR WORK

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.512
BASICALLY FOLLOWS THAT YEAH INTO

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.180
THEM WHAT'S BEEN THE SECRET TO

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.182
YOUR SUCCESS YOU FINING LAND OR

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:32.684
YOU JUST REHABILITATING.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.619

PROVIDE FINANCIAL CONSULTING --

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:39.757
AND WORK WITH DEVELOP NONPROFIT

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.192
THESE AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:42.894
IDENTIFY THE LAND --

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.028
WE HELP THEM SORT OF A SYMBOL

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:45.697
THE FINANCING NEGOTIATE WITH

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:48.433
INVESTORS AND THAT KIND OF THING --

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:50.601
SO WE PLAY SORT OF DISCRETE ROLE

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:52.103
IN THAT VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.971
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.973
DEVELOPMENT IN PARTICULAR.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.108
AND THEN --

00:32:57.175 --> 00:33:00.011
ON PAGE.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.713
THIRTEEN OF YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.681
FOR THE FAR RIGHT.

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.983
A WRY PART THE LOW INCOME AND

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.887
MODERATE HI INCOME --

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:10.488
EIGHT EIGHT FOR FOR BLACKS IS

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.522
THAT WAITED.

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.925
IN OTHER WORDS.

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.561
IS JUSTICE JUST REFLECT THE THE

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:19.030
BLACK POPULATION OR IF.

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.998
THE BLACK POPULATION IS SAY 8%

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.867
OF THE POPULATION WOULD CHANGE.

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.969
THE NUMBERS I JUST.

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.304
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I WHAT I

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:26.938
YEAH -- SO

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:29.640
THE THIS IS A SHARE OF TOTAL SO

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.776
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SO SO YES

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.711
TYPICALLY --

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.246
BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:36.814
TO BE LOW INCOME DUE TO DECADES

00:33:36.881 --> 00:33:38.549
OF DISCRIMINATION AND ALL KINDS

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:39.650
OF FACTORS LIKE THAT --

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.686
BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT WITHIN

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.121
THE UNIVERSE OF MODERATE TO HANG

00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:44.889
COMPLY COUNCILS IN THE BAY AREA --

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.824

NUMBERS WHERE THEY LEFT.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.761
AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.062
LIVE IN POOR.

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.563
SEGREGATED LOW RESOURCE

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.998
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE BAY AREA

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.133
MUCH.

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:56.968
MUCH MORE SO THAN EVEN LOW

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:59.070
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS [inaudible]

LOWER DENSITIES OWNED AREAS AND

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:06.270
SO THEY'VE. ONE OF THE TOOLS

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.539
THEY HAVE USED TO ALLOW --

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.174
TO BLOCK CERTAIN GROUPS OF

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:11.476
PEOPLE FROM LIVING IN THEIR

AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.184

SORT OF BY PASSING THOSE --

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.588
SINGLE FAMILIES ON HIGHER INCOME

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:24.856

PERIPHERY WHICH YOU CAN KIND OF

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:27.959
SEE AN IN THIS SHIFTING

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:30.127
LANDSCAPE OF WHERE LONGER PEOPLE

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:33.231
OF COLOR LIVE IN THE BAY AREA --

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.933
AND AND THIS PART I DIDN'T HEAR

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.236
IF ANYONE HAD REFERENCE BUT DID

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:40.838
ANYONE REFERENCE THE RECENT --

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:43.941
REPORT THAT SHOWS ACROSS THE

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.544
COUNTRY WHEN BANKS WERE EXAMINED

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.145
FOR LOANS AND THIS IS JUST IN

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:51.449
THE LAST. TWO TO FOUR YEARS.

IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:54.452
UNITED STATES INCLUDING

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.521
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:56.587 --> 00:36:00.024
YOUR ABILITY TO GET A LOAN.

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.393
WAS IT INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.963
FACTORS OF INCOME CREDIT SCORE.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.698
WERE WAS IMPACTED ON THE BASIS

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:08.766
OF YOUR RACE AND IF YOU WERE

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.035
BLACK.

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:13.404
YOUR AT YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF THE

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.071
LOAN.

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.540
DROPPED BY A SIGNIFICANT

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.408
PERCENTAGE POINT.

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.277
DID ANYONE NINE REFERENCE THAT

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:22.847
STUDY.

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:25.349
WE DIDN'T BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.484
THAT VERY MUCH MIRRORS OUR

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.219
FINDINGS THAT RACE SEEMS TO BE A

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:29.754
MUCH MORE POWERFUL FACTOR IN

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.056
DETERMINING WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS.

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:34.592
TO THEN INCOME --

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:36.093
AND I THINK THAT IT IT IT.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.595
WHOSE US TO TALK MORE ABOUT RACE

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:38.896
EXPLICITLY AND HOUSING AND LAND

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.298
USE POLICY.

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.232
THANK YOU.

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:43.000
KNOW CLEARLY ARE HEARING TODAY

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.202
IS ABOUT THE HOUSING --

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:47.772
SERVE EMERGENCY CALIFORNIA'S SAN.

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.408
BUT I RAISE THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE

00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:53.277
AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:54.045
IT.

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.112
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:57.682
CAREFUL LENS SO THAT WE IN

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:00.718
ADDRESSING IT DON'T EXACERBATE.

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.521
THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.690
I'VE SAID THIS IS THIS COMMITTEE

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:06.624
NUMBER TIMES BUT I WOULD

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:08.559
RECOMMEND.

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:10.027
THE BOOK THE COLOR OF LAW.

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.663
WHICH DOCUMENTS QUITE CLEAR NOT

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.466
JUST -- RED

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.969
LINING IN MORTGAGE POLICIES BUT

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.036
LITERALLY THE HISTORY.

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.872
OF ZONING.

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.407
AND HOW --

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:26.477
THE EXPANSION OF OUR ONE ZONING

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:28.279
AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE U. S.

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:31.015
HISTORY IN RESPONSE TO WHETHER

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.818
IT WAS EXPLICITLY SAID OR NOT.

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:36.020
BUT THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT JUMPS

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.922
IN EFFORTS TO DOWN ZONE AFTER

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.624
THINGS LIKE THE PASSAGE OF THE

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.025
FAIR HOUSING ACT.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.361
AND THE COURT RULING IN THE

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:46.063
CIGARETTE INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.666
SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF GOOD

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.569
DOCUMENTATION AROUND.

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:54.205
BE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC.

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:57.608
EXPLICIT RACIAL AND ECONOMIC

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.644
EXCLUSION.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:04.715

REITERATE --

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.822
DIE -- YOU

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:12.456

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.191
FAMILY HOME IN A SINGLE FAMILY

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.526
HOME.

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.128
OUR COMMUNITY WORK BUT IT WAS

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.295
YOU KNOW --

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.864
YOU KNOW AND THIS IS SO COMMON

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.666
WHERE YOU IN SO MANY --

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:23.434
SUBURBAN AREAS IN PARTICULAR IT

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.403
SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE NEW

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.104
ONE PART OF TOWN.

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:28.139
DEAD ZONE FOR MULTI UNIT AND

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.374
THAT'S WERE LOW INCOME PEOPLE

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.043

RACIAL ZONING AND SO --

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.387
I THINK WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:47.291
THAT HISTORY AND AND TODAY IT'S

LOOK AT HOUSING PRODUCTION --

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.716

A SINCE I STEPPED FOOT INTO THE

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.051
STATE -- I

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:37.454
THINK THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.089
AND I DON'T TAKE SAME OUT

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:42.026
LIGHTLY --

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:43.227
BUT THERE ARE --

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:44.361
THERE ARE ROLES AND

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.830
RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.299
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:02.613
THERE ARE MANY FOR THAT MAKE UP

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.881
WHAT WE CALL THE HOUSING

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:06.483
PRODUCTION SYSTEM IN THE STATE.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.785
AND I THINK --

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:09.386
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.721

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.143

CENTER WINNER AND I CONTINUE TO

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.082
HAVE CONVERSATIONS I DO WANT TO

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.983
TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE STRATEGIC

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.286
CAN FILL IN THAT STREAMLINING.

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.720
BECAUSE WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE.

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.823
IS THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.525
SOME APPROACH. TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:32.262
HOUSING BUILT FASTER.

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:34.765
IN AREAS WHERE --

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:35.766
HOUSING HAS ALREADY BEEN SEWN

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:38.802
[inaudible] FOR THEY LIKE TO BE

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.437
ABLE TO GET YOUR TAKE.

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.239
ON THAT --

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:45.209
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE ON HOW

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:48.112
WE GET THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS.

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.680
AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.048
PROCESS --

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:53.350
ON LOOKING AT A STRATEGIC

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:55.552
APPROACH OR AREAS OF ALREADY

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:56.954
BEEN SOWN FOR HOUSING.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.388
AND TO BE ABLE TO STREAM THAT

00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.390
PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:01.391
BELT AND I COULD COMMENT ON THAT.

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.093
IF YOU THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.697
TOP TOOLS IN ABOUT.

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:12.002
NOT ALL AT ONCE SO --

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.338
CHAIRMAN OUT I'VE BEEN HAPPY TO

00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:18.709
TO CHIME IN ON ON THIS --

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:19.042
ONE YOU KNOW.

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.244
IN THE LAST AGAIN I LOOK AT THE

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.845
LAST TWO YEARS --

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:22.713
A COUPLE OF THE TOOLS THAT I

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:23.981
THINK --

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:26.016
WILL HELP ACCELERATE A GETTING

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.284
HOUSES BUILT GETTING AFFORDABLE

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:29.486
HOUSES BUILT OUR PROP ONE AND

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.421
AND PROP --

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:35.425
TO WE AT UNDERSTAND IN THE STATE

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:36.894
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A DIFFERENT

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.427
SOURCE.

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.730
OF ON GOING FINANCING THAT

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.098
HELPED PRODUCE AFFORDABLE

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:42.232
HOUSING --

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:44.635
THAT RESOURCE NO LONGER EXIST

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.103
AND THEIR EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.271
AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.772
ABOUT A REPLACEMENT --

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:51.808
BUT I THINK PROP ONE IN --

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:52.643
SIX TOWARDS --

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.411
GETTING MORE HOUSES PRODUCED

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.648
QUICKLY I THINK IF WE CAN --

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:59.583
SEE A NEW VERSION TODAY'S

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.751
VERSION OF TAX INCREMENT

00:47:00.817 --> 00:47:02.186
FINANCING --

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.887
I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:06.356
TO GETTING MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS --

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.725
UNITS BUILT I THINK --

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.127
WITH SOME OF THE PLANNING

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:13.130
DOLLARS FROM SB TWO I THINK AND

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.932
I BELIEVE THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:16.433
TO START TO FLOW --

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.569
IN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT --

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.037
CITIES AROUND THE STATE --

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.872
WILL BE --

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.473
TAKING UP THE OFFER OF THOSE

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.076
RESOURCES AND STREAMLINING THEIR

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:28.412
PROCESS SEES AND ALSO UPDATING

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:29.379
THEIR PLANS AND AND THERE'S

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:30.981
OWNING SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.549
VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS.

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.618
THAT YOU ALL AND ARE VOTERS HAVE

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.253
PUT INTO PLACE EVEN IN JUST THE

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.088
LAST YEAR THAT WILL HELP

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.057
ACCELERATE OR AT LEAST JUMPSTART.

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:40.857
SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:41.925
CONSTRUCTION THAT PROBABLY

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:44.061
WASN'T HAPPENING A YEAR AGO BUT

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.230
I SUSPECT KNOWING OF MY CITIES

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.698
THE WAY I DO ABOUT WERE PROBABLY

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:51.168
PLANNED WAITING FOR RESOURCES.

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:53.003
TO GET THOSE UNDER WAY.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.738
THE RABBIT JUST ADD --

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.907
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MYRIAD OF

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.008
CHALLENGES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING

00:47:58.075 --> 00:47:59.676
TO OUR TO OUR ISSUE AND AND SO

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.345
YOU YOU REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.646
DO I HOW TO TACKLE IT FROM

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.648
MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS.

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.084
YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD OURSELVES

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.352
OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WHEN A UNIT

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.153
OF HOUSING COSTS SIX HUNDRED AND

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.555
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD.

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.723
AFFORDABLE UNIT RIGHT SO THE

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:15.292
CONSTRUCTION STATE OF ALL WE

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.860
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.629
DOWN COSTS IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.264
ABLE TO BRING MORE UNITS ONLINE

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.733
FASTER WHICH THEN LEADS LEADS TO

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:23.300
HOW DO WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.301
TYPOLOGIES.

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:25.936
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.137
OUR LABOR COMMUNITY AND OUR

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:28.805
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT MODULAR

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:31.408
HOUSING ABOUT HOW DO WE BRING

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:34.177
NEW CONSTRUCTION ON FASTER --

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.212
SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:36.546
COMPONENTS I THINK ANOTHER

00:48:36.613 --> 00:48:38.115
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS.

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:40.651
EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO WE WERE

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.218
ZONE FOR ALL THE HOUSING WE

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.486
NEEDED --

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:43.820
AND WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD IT WE

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.255
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LABOR TO

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:47.057
ACTUALLY BUILD IT SO FIGURING

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.625
OUT HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE LABOR

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.594
PIPELINE SO THAT THERE ARE

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:51.895
ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.597
DO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.598
HOUSING --

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.334
ACTED ACQUISITION REHABS I MEAN

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.369
WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT NOT

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.038
WHO IS CURRENTLY IN THE LABOR

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.873
MARKET IN OUR LABOR UNIONS BUT

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.107
HOW DO WE LOOK AT OUR YOUNG

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:06.043
PEOPLE HOW DO WE TAP INTO --

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:08.312
YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE IN OAKLAND

00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:10.814
FOR EXAMPLE WHO BY BY THE TIME

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.416
THEY REACHED HIGH SCHOOL ARE NOT

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.051
FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL HOW DO WE

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:15.319
GET THOSE FOLKS INTERESTED IN

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.119
THE TRADES.

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.587
SO HOT WE HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE%

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.222
CREATIVE AND DYNAMIC AROUND OUR

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.124
SOLUTIONS AND BE ABLE TO COME AT

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.359
IT FROM DIFFERENT.

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:24.728
LEVELS SO THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:27.364
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN CAN SEE

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.666
THEMSELVES IN THE SOLUTIONS.

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.535
MY COMMENTS ARE GONNA BE ABOUT

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:33.103
THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.938
BUT I'LL I'LL JUST REITERATE A

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:37.240
COUPLE THINGS --

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.042
WE WE DO HAVE SOME TREMENDOUS

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.911
NEW RESOURCES --

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.245
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.647
THINK THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:46.049
BUT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH COSTS

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.651
KEEP RISING THOSE DOLLARS ARE

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:48.985
GOING TO BECOME LESS AND LESS

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.654
EFFICIENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:51.121
BUILD.

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:53.724
AS MANY HOMES AS ARE NECESSARY

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.025
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM --

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.527
SO JUST TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.495
THEN I THINK WE ALSO GET CAUGHT

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.963
IN THIS -- A

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.732
DISCUSSION OF WHAT ARE WE

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:03.266
ACTUALLY BUILDING ARE WE

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.701
BUILDING REALLY DENSE TALL

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:05.769
HOUSING --

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.305
OR WE ONLY BUILDING --

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:12.008
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OF PLACES

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.710
ONE OF ARCHER'S CENTER FOLLOWS

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:14.644
THAT SHE DOES REALLY GOOD WORK

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:15.812
ON THIS --

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.814
AND WE HAVE LARGE.

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.516
SWATHS OF LAND WHERE YOU HAVE NO

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:20.684
BUILDING --

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.886
WHATSOEVER OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:23.520
DECADES --

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:25.122
IT IN SO TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.823
WE CAN TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.658
BUILDING TYPOLOGIES SO MISSING

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:29.960
MIDDLE HOUSING THINGS LIKE

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:31.795
DUPLEXES AND PRACTICES --

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.230
AND WHERE THAT FITS INTO OUR

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.831
EXISTING LAND USE PATTERNS I

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:36.433
THINK THAT'S A REALLY KEY

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.301
COMPONENT AS THIS TYPE OF

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.170
HOUSING IS INHERENTLY CHEAPER TO

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.005
BUILD CAN BE BUILT FASTER --

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:44.307
AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY DISRUPT

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.976
THE EXISTING CHARACTER MANY OF

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:47.411
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS --

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:50.013
SO -- I'LL

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.617
HELLO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.085
SENATE MCGUIRE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.953
THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.955
HOUSING SHOULD FOCUS ON MEETING

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:00.424
THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.691
DOLLAR HOME.

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.326
GAP THAT YOU IDENTIFIED THAT'S

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.795
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S A CRISIS

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:06.229
DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY LOW

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:08.899
INCOME CALIFORNIANS --

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.233
AND SO WE WE NEED MORE PUBLIC

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.469
INVESTMENT ABSOLUTELY FROM THE

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.271
STATE AND AND LOCALLY.

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:15.806
I'LL JUST MAKE A PLUG YOU KNOW

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:18.141
WE MAY ALSO NEED LANDS THAT HIS

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.010
OWN TO ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.077
HOUSING WHICH IS.

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:23.313
A CHEAPER ON A PER UNIT BASIS TO

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:23.713
BUILD.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.649
AND ST CHEAPER TO LIVE IN --

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.617
SO THAT WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:28.952
HOUSING AND ALSO APARTMENT

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.487
BUILDINGS THAT ARE LARGE ENOUGH

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:31.588
TO TRIGGER AN INCLUSIONARY

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:32.756
POLICY.

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.458
THAT SO THEY HAVE AFFORDABLE

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:35.992
UNITS IN THEM --

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.728
CLOSE TO TRANSIT YES IT'S THAT

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:39.663
HAVE.

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:40.964
A TYPICALLY RESISTED APARTMENT

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.933
BUILDINGS HISTORICALLY WHICH MAY

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.401
NOT BE RIGHT NEXT TO TRANSIT BUT

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:45.302
THEY MIGHT BE CLOSE TO JOB

RATE AS FACTORS.

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.176
AN ADDED COST BURDEN IS A NEW

HOUSEHOLDS ON AT THE END OF THIS

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.924
CYCLE AND WE ADJUSTED BASED ON

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.559
THESE FACTORS.

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.094
WITHIN SUBTRACT OUT HOW MANY

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.630
UNITS THERE ARE TODAY IN THAT

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:23.366
REGION UP FROM THAT NUMBER TO

MOST OF THESE FACTORS EXISTED IN

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:56.099
PRIOR CYCLES BUT AB SEVENTEEN

00:58:56.165 --> 00:58:57.200

GHG EMISSION TARGETS AS FACTORS

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.888
THE COG MUST CONSIDER.

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.757
AND WHEN OTHER FACTORS --

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.292

THAT MIGHT NOT BE PART OF THIS

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.097
LIST THEY MUST BE SHOWN TO NOT

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:29.766
BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.367
STATUTORY OBJECTIVES.

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:32.702
SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT ALSO

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:33.970
PROHIBITED THE COUNCILS OF

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.104
GOVERNMENT FROM USING PASSED

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:39.475
UNDER PRODUCTION AS A REASON FOR

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:42.045
RINA.

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:43.313
WE ARE NOW AT THE END OF THE

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:45.048
FIFTH CYCLE OF THE HOUSING

00:59:45.114 --> 00:59:46.149
ELEMENT.

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:48.918
SO THAT TIME LINE SHOWN HERE --

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.453
ARE FOR THE FIFTH CYCLE AND WE

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.788
ARE NOW JUST EMBARKING ON THE

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:54.390
BEGINNING OF THE SIX CYCLE OF

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:55.992
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS.

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.294
ASSESSMENT PREPARATION SO THE

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.496
SAN DIEGO --

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.130
ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS ALSO

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.366
KNOWN -- HAS

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.601
RECEIPT RECEIVED THEIR DRUG

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:06.803
THERE --

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.638
FINAL ALLOCATION FROM THE

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.639

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.940
AND THEY ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.343
OF DEVELOPING THEIR METHODOLOGY --

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:15.044
TO ALLOCATE THAT TO THEIR

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.245
JURISDICTIONS.

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.547
WHERE IS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:19.282
ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS AND

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:20.683
THE SACRAMENTO ASSOCIATION OF

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.186
GOVERNMENTS WILL RECEIVE THEIR --

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:26.089
AT DRAFT ASSESSMENTS FROM MARINA

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.257
ON IN THE OVER THE NEXT FEW

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:33.629
MONTHS.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:36.332
I WOULD THINK IT'S HELPFUL.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.533
TO EXPLAIN THAT THE REGIONAL

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.701
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.403
PROJECTION OF ADDITIONAL HOUSING

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.538
UNITS NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.973
PROJECTED HOUSEHOLD GROWTH.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.541
OF ALL INCOME LEVELS FROM THE

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.809
START UNTIL THE END OF THE

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:47.944
PROJECTION PERIOD.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.013
SO IT IS NOT A PREDICTION OF HOW

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.547
MUCH --

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:53.282
PERMITTING WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.950
AND IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:56.853
CEILING OF HOW MUCH HOUSING --

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:59.322
DEMANDER PRODUCTION SHOULD OCCUR

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.790
AND IT IS NOT LIMITED DUE TO

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.525
EXISTING LAND USE CAPACITY OR

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.560
GROWTH CONTROL REZONING IS OFTEN

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:08.097
NECESSARY FOR JURISDICTIONS TO

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.533
ACCOMMODATE THEIR THEIR ARENA

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:10.833

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.842

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:20.910
HOUSING PACKAGE --

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.813
WILL MAKE SIX CYCLE A FRIEND AND

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.648
ARE TOO MUCH TO COVER IN A SHORT

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.817
TIME TODAY BUT YOU CAN FIND MORE

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.318

SO I WORK FOR THE PUBLIC

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.132
INTEREST LAW PROJECT WHICH IS A

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.767
STATE WIDE SUPPORT CENTER --

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.535

TO LOCAL LEGAL AID PROGRAMS

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.605
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN AREAS OF

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.840
HOUSING LAND USE AND PUBLIC

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.074
BENEFITS.

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.275
AND MY TRAINING FOR THIS JOB WAS

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.477
I SPENT FOURTEEN YEARS IN A

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.845
LOCAL LEGAL AID PROGRAM WHERE

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.980
MOST OF THE FOCUS OF MY WORK WAS

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.448
ON HOUSING AND LAND USE.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.283
MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.384
WHO WATCH IN OUR DOOR EVERY DAY

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:37.386
WHO ARE A CONSTANT REMINDER OF

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.555
THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING STABLE

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.357
SAFE HOUSE.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.959
RIGHT ALL OF THE EMPLOYMENT

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:46.295
NECESSARY NOT OUT COMES IN

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:47.597
RESPONSE TO THAT --

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.165
WHAT I WANTED TO VOTE FOCUS ON

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.534
TODAY OR THREE PRIMARY AREAS

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.402
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHANGES TO

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:54.937
HOUSING ELEMENT LAW AND KIND OF

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.205
THE RESPONSES TO THAT THE

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.740
BENEFITS RIGHT IN TERMS OF

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:59.976
INCREASING COMPLIANCE AND ALSO?

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.010
I JUST INCREASING COMPLIANCE

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.945
WITH THE LAW BUT THAT RESULTING

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.947
IN BETTER PLANNING AND ZONING

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.383
AND PRODUCTION OF HOUSING --

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.352
GOING BACK TO CHANGES THAT WERE

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.187
MADE PRIOR TO THE FIFTH CYCLE

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.689
THAT MEGAN REFERRED TO ALSO SOME

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.224
CHANGES THAT WERE PART OF THE

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.493
ENORMOUS HOUSING PACKAGE INTO

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.628
TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S EARLY NOW

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.396
IN THE PLANNING STAGES TO SEE

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.365
SOME OF THOSE RESPONSES --

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.699
BUT I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:25.001
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.036
AND THEN LASTLY JUST TO FOCUS ON

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.504
SOME FUTURE CHANGES TO HOUSING

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.972
ELEMENT LAW --

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.375
HOPEFULLY AS SENATOR POINTED OUT

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.776
HOUSING ELEMENTS DON'T HOUSE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.778
PEOPLE HOMES DO BUT AS WE RAISE

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:36.946
THE BAR FOR WHAT HOUSING ON IT'S

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.781
REQUIRED THAT IS MORE LIKELY TO

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.449
RESULT IN HOMES THAT IT WAS

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.185
MAYBE TEN YEARSAGO --

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.020
SO FIRST TO POINT OUT SOME OF

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.388
THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED AT THE

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.689
START OF THE FIFTH --

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:47.657
PLANNING PERIOD IN THOSE YOU

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.859
KNOW WE NOW HAVE HAD EIGHT YEARS

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:50.760
AND SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.061
ARE ALMOST EIGHT YEARS TO SEE

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.063
HOW THOSE CHANGES HAVE IMPACTED

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:57.200
AS A MOSTLY UP POSITIVELY --

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.235
SOIN ADDITION TO CHANGING

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.169
HOUSING ELEMENTS TO AN EIGHT

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.571
YEAR PLANNING PERIOD THERE WERE

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.472
SOME OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES --

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.608
ONE WAS TO IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.143
LACK OF A BETTER WORD AND CITIES

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.711
AND COUNTIES THAT DID NOT TIMELY

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.146
ADOPT THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.315
SO THAT IF THEY WENT BEYOND A

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:13.416
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS FROM THEIR

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:18.087
STATUTORY DUE DATE --

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:21.591
THEY HAD TO DO TO HOUSING TO

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.125
ESTABLISH A FIRM DEADLINE FOR

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:25.094
ANY REZONING THAT WAS REQUIRED

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.262
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.997
SITES IN YOUR INVENTORY AND YOU

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:29.232
NEEDED TO REZONE FOR THAT

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:31.000
SHORTFALL YOU HAD TO DO SO

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.635
WITHIN THREE YEARS --

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.704
AND LASTLY IDENTIFYING ZONES

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.138
WHERE EMERGENCY SHELTERS COULD

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.007
BE LOCATED --

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.609
WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.210
SO I WOULD SAY THE OUTCOMES TO

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.379
THOSE THREE PRIMARY CHANGES WERE

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.647
MOSTLY POSITIVE --

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.350
SOME OF THEM WERE NOT AS MUCH.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:50.253
OF I WOULD SAY IN THE AREA OF

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.321
THE DUE DATE --

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.789
WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.391
YOUR STATUTORY DEADLINE HAS

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.727
CAUSED SOME CONFUSION IT OFTEN

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:58.961
BECAME FROM THE AT BAT BECAUSE

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.496
PERSPECTIVE THAT THE NEW

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.565
DEADLINE WAS THE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.433
DAYS AFTER THE STATUTORY DUE

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.968
DATE RIGHT NO LONGER DO WE PAY

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:07.103
ATTENTION TO NECESSARILY.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.604
THE DUE DATE THAT IS IN THE

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.006
STATUTE BUT NOW THE ONLY ONE

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.540
THAT MATTERS AS A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.175
DAYS OUT WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.510
NOT NECESSARILY GETTING TIMELY

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.878
ADOPTION AND OFF IN

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.480
JURISDICTIONS REFER TO THIS AS

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.215
THE GRACE PERIOD --

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.783
IT WASN'T INTENDED THIS IS A TO

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.285
BE SO BUT THAT'S HOW IT WAS

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.552
REFERRED --

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.988
TO THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THAT

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:26.722
IS THAT.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.824
THE STATUTORY DUE DATE REQUIRED

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:31.294
YOU TO ADOPT A HOUSING ELEMENT

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.029
WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BUT

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.031
NOT A LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.332
ELEMENT AT THAT TIME.

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:38.334
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS JURISDICTIONS

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.636
ADOPT A HOUSING ELEMENT AND THEN

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:41.837
RECEIVE A LETTER FINING FROM A

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:43.105
CD THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.440
COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND THEN IT

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.709
MIGHT TAKE ONE YEAR SIX MONTHS

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.044
TWO YEARS FOR THEM TO REVISE

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.645
THAT HOUSING ELEMENT. TO COME

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.180
INTO COMPLIANCE SO TIMELY

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.882
ADOPTION DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:55.051
TRANSLATE INTO TIMELY ADOPTION

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.520
OF A LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:58.954
ELEMENT --

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.824
THE OTHER FACTOR THAT REMAINS --

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.292
AT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.727
ADDRESSED SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.462
IS THE IDEA OF THE FOUR YEAR

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.431
ELEMENT AS RESULT OF NOT

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.132
ADOPTING A HOUSING ELEMENT IN A

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.967
TIMELY WAY --

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:14.704
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I I I AND NOT

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.705
IN THE MINDSET OF THE

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.039
LEGISLATURE WHEN THE ADOPTED

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.641
THAT PENALTY BUT THE ASSUMPTION

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.810
PROBABLY WAS THAT MOST PEOPLE

01:06:20.876 --> 01:06:21.844
WOULD BE WITH IT MOST

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.245
JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE WITHIN A

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.613
FEW MONTHS OF THAT.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.948
DEADLINE.

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:29.051
SOMETIMES JURISDICTIONS ARE TWO

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:29.952
THREE IN ADOPTING THEIR HOUSING

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:31.387
ELEMENT AND SO THE IDEA OF

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.955
ADOPTING A FOUR YEAR CYCLE THAT

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.557
BECOMES CONFUSING BECAUSE ARE

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.125
YOU REQUIRED TO UPDATE WITHIN

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.426
SIX MONTHS OF JUST ADOPTING

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.394
YOU'RE.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.730
VERY VERY LATE HOUSING ELEMENT --

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.898
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE TECHNICAL

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.633
ISSUES BUT THEY DO NEED TO BE

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.669
RESOLVED TO GET THE BEST AND

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.404
MOST LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.306
ELEMENTS THAT WE CAN.

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.475
I WOULD SAY A VERY POSITIVE --

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.009
RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO THE

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.745
DEADLINE OF HAVING TO RESIGN

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.813
WITHIN THREE YEARS --

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.148
PREVIOUSLY ON THE FIVE YEAR

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.483
PLANNING PERIOD WITHOUT A

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.851
REQUIREMENT FOR WHEN THE RESUMES

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.952
HAD TO OCCUR SOMETIMES

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.954
JURISDICTIONS WERE WAITING FOR

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.322
THE VERY END OF THE PLANNING.

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.890
OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.291
MEET YOUR HOUSING NEED FOR THAT

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.726
PLANNING PUREED IF YOU'RE

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.428
WAITING TO THE VERY LAST MINUTE

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.863
TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE ZONING

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.698
SO HAVING AN UP FRONT DEADLINE

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.832
THREE YEARS INTO THE PROCESS

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.167
WHEN YOU STILL HAVE SEVERAL

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.068
YEARS AGO.

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.036
IT'S BEEN A VERY POSITIVE CHANGE

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.071
AND HAS RESULTED IN A LOT OF

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.739
REZONING IS HAPPENING MUCH

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.508
EARLIER IN THE PLANNING PROCESS

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:29.078
THAN EVER BEFORE --

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.513
AND THE LAST OF CHANGE THAT I

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.748
REFERRED TO IS DESIGNATING SITES

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:34.717
FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS --

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.218
THAT DO NOT REQUIRE

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.320
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW AND I WOULD

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.755
SAY THERE THE THE RESPONSE HAS

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.090
ALSO BEEN POSITIVE IN TERMS OF

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:43.159
THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHO

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.194
COMPLIED WITH THAT REQUIREMENT --

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.662
ONE AREA THAT WE TEND TO FOCUS

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.431
ON IS AT HOUSING ADVOCATES IS

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.266
THE CAPACITY OF THOSE SITES THE

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:51.667
NOT JUST IDENTIFYING A ZONE

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.402
WHERE SHELTERS ARE PERMITTED BUT

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.070
THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY CAPACITY

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.273
IN THOSE SITES FOR SHELTERS TO

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:57.873
BE DEVELOPED AND THAT THEY'RE

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.374
ACTUALLY.

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.975
SOME PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT IN

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:03.345
OTHER NEEDS THAT SHELTER --

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:03.813
RESIDENTS WOULD HAVE.

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.915
IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.650
CHANGES AS I MENTIONED IT'S

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.652
EARLY IN THE PROCESS THERE SOME.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.152
COMMUNITIES AS HAVE BEEN

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.987
MENTIONED THAT ARE VERY LATE IN

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.756
THEIR PROCESS AND IN ADOPTING

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.024
THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT AND THEY

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.859
ARE SUBJECT TO THE CHANGES FROM

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.028
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PACKAGE --

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:22.832
AN OVER ALL I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.633
THE THE MORE RIGID REQUIREMENTS

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.868
IN TERMS OF USING NON BACON

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.037
SITES IN TERMS OF HAVING TO

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:30.339
MONITOR YOUR LOSS OF UNITS TO

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.607
THE NET CHANGES TO THE NO NET

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:32.508
LOSS.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.310
OF LAW HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.145
IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY HAVING

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.814
SUITABLE FEASIBLE SO.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.050
SO YOU FOR FOR A LONG TIME

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.751
JURISDICTIONS COULD IDENTIFY NON

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.620
VACANT SITES AS PART OF THEIR

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.055
HOUSING ELEMENT INVENTORY.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.323
BUT HAVING TO SHOW THAT THE

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.958
EXISTING USES REALLY ARE NOT

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.860
GOING TO INTERFERE OR IMPEDE

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.528
WITH POTENTIAL RESIDENTIAL

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:53.963
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.732
VERY USEFUL IN TERMS OF MAKING

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.666
SURE THOSE SITES REALLY ARE

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.001
FEASIBLE AND WILL PROBABLY

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.436
DEVELOP WITHIN THE PLANNING

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.104
PERIOD --

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:03.873
THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO MAKE

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.876
IS ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES AND SO.

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:08.244
PROBABLY THE CHANGES TO NO NET

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.679
LOSS COME CLOSEST --

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.248
TO IDENTIFYING THE REAL ISSUE

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.016
THAT THAT THAT MAY BE LACKING

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.185
BETWEEN THE PLANNING FOR HOUSING

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.720
AND THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION OF

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:19.688
HOUSING WHICH IS THAT WE RELIED

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.757
ON A LONG TIME FOR DENSITY AS A

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.259
PROXY FOR AFFORDABILITY.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.127
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN TERMS

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.929
OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT INVENTORY --

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.031
AND NO NET LOSS CHANGES HAVE

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.299
BEEN THE CLOSEST TO KIND OF

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.468
IDENTIFYING THE IDEA THAT IF YOU

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:33.903
IDENTIFY A SITE IN YOUR HOUSING

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.971
ELEMENT. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.606
SPECIFIC INCOME GROUP.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:38.541
AND THAT SITE IS DEVELOPED FOR

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:40.142
DOT FOR A DIFFERENT INCOME GROUP

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:41.477
THAT YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT SO

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:42.811
IDENTIFYING THAT THE SITE IS NOT

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:44.813
JUST ABOUT DENSITY BUT ACTUALLY

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.149
BEING AVAILABLE FOR THAT INCOME

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:47.883
LEVEL.

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.852
OTHER CHANGES ARE PROBABLY

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:53.455
NECESSARY LOOSE CHANGE WAS MADE.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.157
PART OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGE YES

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:55.991
THAT'S I THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.393
THAT THAT HIS GOD IF YOU KNOW

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.928
THAT'S A VERY USEFUL STEP

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.096
TOWARDS KIND OF AVOIDING DENSITY

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.898
AS THE PROP THE ONLY PROXY FOR

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:03.766
AFFORDABILITY.

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:05.334
INSTEAD OF A REQUIREMENT FOR

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.069
AFFORDABILITY WHETHER THAT COMES

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:08.170
FROM A REQUIREMENT WHETHER IT

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.972
COMES FROM INCENTIVES THAT'S FOR

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.507
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TO

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.308
DECIDE.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.310
BUT NEEDING MORE THAN JUST THE

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.111
IDEA THAT DENSITY ALONE IS GOING

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.379
TO RESULT IN AFFORDABILITY

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:20.916
ESPECIALLY IN MOST OF THE LARGER

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.117
HOUSING MARKETS IN OUR STATE.

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:23.852
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY CHANCE

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:25.487
TO SUBMIT THESE COMMENTS THANK

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.022
YOU VERY MUCH ACCORDING TO THEIR

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:30.259
ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL --

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.694
YES SENATOR MORE LOCK.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.295
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.830
STILL TRYING TO GET MY ARMS

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.098
AROUND RENO AFTER.

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:38.334
ALL THESE YEARS AND SO I HAVE

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.035
FOUR CITIES.

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.236
THERE JAY SENT THE BORDER EACH

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:44.373
OTHER. ONE HAS TO READ READ A

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.710
REQUIREMENT OF FIVE ANOTHER ONE

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:48.844
TOO BUT WE'RE GETTING RID OF

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.780
THAT THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY.

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.148
ANOTHER ONE IS.

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.383
EIGHTY SIX WE ARE THE FIRST TO A

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.317
POPULATIONS OF A HUNDRED

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.886
THOUSAND SOME ODD. EIGHTY SIXES

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.388
GOT.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.523
EIGHTY THOUSAND AND IN A CITY OF

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.124
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH HAS

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.960
ARENA REQUIREMENT OF ABOUT. ONE

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:05.594
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.963
THREE WHICH YEAH.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.199
AND AND AND THEIR SHORT FOUR

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:10.799
HUNDRED I MEAN THEY'RE WORKING

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.568
ON IT.

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:13.669
BUT IT SAID CITY HUNTINGTON

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:16.105
BEACH I GOT.

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.640
TO AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.908
WHY IS A CITY THAT'S TRYING TO

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.877
PRODUCE THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:22.945
THREE UNITS FROM THE NEIGHBOR?

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.781
NEXT DOOR ONLY HAS TO PRODUCE.

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.349
TO IS NOW THE CENTER OF ALL THE

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:30.119
NEWS AND ALL THE FUN AROUND HERE

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.387
SO HELP ME OUT CAN YOU.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.188
HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.090
CONSTITUENTS?

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:39.094
I SO YES THE THE THE FIFTH CYCLE

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.696
AND THE LAST CYCLE WE CAME UP ON

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:41.797
AS THE NUMBERS YOU'RE REFERRING

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.399
TO SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.567
JURISDICTION'S HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.403
AND A COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT ON

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.271
EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THE BOLD

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:49.972
ON THIS THE COUNCIL OF

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.607
GOVERNMENT --

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:52.107
FOR THAT REGION SOUTHERN

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.077
CALIFORNIA SO WAS LEGALLY

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.812
REQUIRED TO CONSIDER ALL OF

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.514
THESE FACTORS IN HOW THEY TOOK

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.682
THE REGIONAL NUMBER THAT EACH

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.016
CITY PROVIDED.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.851
IN ALLOCATING TO THEIR

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:03.986
JURISDICTIONS --

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.989
BUT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.291
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.693
TO DO OTHER THAN CONSIDER THAT

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:13.095
SO COMING UP IN THE NEXT CYCLE

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.930
THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SPELL

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:15.798
OUT.

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:18.167
HOW ALL NUMBERS WERE GIVEN OUT

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.835
ACCORDING TO A METHODOLOGY

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.503
INCLUDING?

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:22.805
MAKE IT CLEAR HOW EACH OF THE

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:25.908
FACTORS ON THIS LIST WAS USED --

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.209
AND AC WILL HAVE A REVIEW WITH

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.210
ALREADY THERE THAT WASN'T

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.379
PRESENT IN THE PRIOR CYCLE AND

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:33.282
SO THERE IS NO WAY TO TRACE BACK

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.783
THE LINEAGE OF HOW.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.653
A FIVE VERSES AT TEN THOUSAND

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.854
WAS DECIDED --

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.556
SO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.691
WILL CHANGE GOING FORWARD BUT

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.026
WAS NOT PRESENT IN THE LAST

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.228
CYCLE -- AND

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.497
THEN I I I THINK DOES THAT

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.965
ADDRESS PART OF THAT'S GOOD THAT

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.134

I'M NOT DOING THE MATH IT'S NOT

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.005
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT FOR ME SO I

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:57.940
JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BRING IT

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.641

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:02.778
AND AND JUST.

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.147
YOU KNOW FOR MAYBE.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.616
EQUAL TIME MR.

THE OTHERS THAT CITY WITH ME AND

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.289
IF I JUST MAY --

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:16.458
TO PIGGY BACK ON THAT I THINK --

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.593
I THINK THIS HERB IS A 100%

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.261
RIGHT THAT THE BILLS THAT WE

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.463
PASSED IN --

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:22.698
WE WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST FEW

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.366
YEARS A WHOLE SERIES OF BILLS

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.401
FROM BOTH HOUSES. TO REALLY

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.237
TIGHTEN UP THE HOUSING ELEMENT

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.305
LAW STOP SOME OF THE AVOIDANCE

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.574
TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN USE

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.275
LIKE SAY --

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:34.510
WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR LOW INCOME

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.211
HOUSING ON THIS SITE WE KNOW

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.346
THAT A TARGET WITH SINCE BUILT

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:38.680
THERE TWO YEARS AGO SO IT'S NOT

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:39.948
GONNA BE AVAILABLE FIFTY YEARS

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.283
WITHOUT TO RE DOING.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:45.621
A LOW INCOME HOUSING TO REALLY

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:49.892
CUT DOWN. TO RENO.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:53.095
RENO IS SO POLITICIZED AND YOU

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.696
KNOW AT AT THE REGION GETS ITS

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.198
AGGREGATE NUMBER AND THAT IT'S A

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.132
FOOD FIGHT.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.234
ABOUT WHAT THE ALLOCATIONS ARE

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.602
TEACH CITY AND SO WEALTHIER

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.104
CITIES TEND TO BE ABLE TO PUSH%

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.006
DOWN THEIR NUMBERS --

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.607
AND YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.176
OUTRAGEOUS DISPARITIES CITING

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:09.178
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REDUCTION

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:11.046
AND AND THAT KIND OF APPROACH I

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.714
THINK THAT'S FAIR MISTER BECAUSE

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.150
I'M FINDING THAT CITIES ARE

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.018
DOING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.753
AND THEN THEY DON'T MEET HIM.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.121
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.923
PENALTIES SHOW UP OR WHAT

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.491
HAPPENED I I HAVE BEEN

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:25.160
FRUSTRATED WITH SB TWO ZONES.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.929
SO I'VE GOT CITIES THAT FINALLY

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.363
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY SHOULD PUT

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.164
A HOMELESS SHELTER.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.834
AND THEN I GO.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.235

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.403

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.274
HOMELESS SHELTER ONLY BE TOLD BY

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.709
THE CITY NO WAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.577

COUNTIES THAT ONLY HAVE SHELTER

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.965
BEDS IN THE WINTER OR HAVE VERY

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.967

HOW IS THAT GOING TO THANK.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:19.341
STATE JUST AS I SAID THAT.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.142
HOUSING ELEMENT.

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.044
MATTERS IF THE HOUSING ELEMENT

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.880
BARS RAISED SO JUST AS WE HAS

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.515
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:29.051
SITES FOR FOR ZONING FOR THAT

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.652
SINGLE FAMILY MULTI FAMILY

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:31.553
HOUSING.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.957
ZONING FOR SHELTERS COULD ALSO

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:38.360
YOU SO THE INITIAL IT'LL PHASE

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:42.464
IS I DID JONES WERE SHOCKED

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.066
WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.634
BUT THEN WHEN YOU SEE WHERE

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.002
THOSE SITES ARE LOCATED OR WHERE

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.403
THERE IS OWNS ARE LOCATED

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.138
SOMETIMES THAT IS NOT IN TERMS

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.707
OF WHAT AVAILABLE FUNDING MIGHT

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:52.441
BE.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.875
WHAT IN TERMS OF WHAT ACCESS

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.210
THERE MIGHT BE AN AMENITIES THEY

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.446
MAY NOT BE THE BEST SITES?

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.947
FOR SHELTERS ALSO THERE MIGHT

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.515
NOT REALLY BE CAPACITY WITHIN

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:01.984
THOSE ZONES FOR SHELTERS THAT

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.418
COULD REALLY MEET THAT NEED.

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:04.753
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.155
SAY IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:07.789
TWENTY SEVENTEEN PACKAGE REALLY

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:08.657
TIGHTENED UP.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:10.025
THE ADEQUACY OF THE SITES

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.727
REQUIREMENTS AND NOT RE USING

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.228
SITES OVER AND OVER AND SOME OF

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.563
THE OTHER CHANGES.

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.331
ZONES THAT PERMIT EMERGENCY

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.966
SHELTERS WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.102
REVIEW PROBABLY COULD BENEFIT

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:20.936
FROM SOME OF THOSE SAME

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:22.504
REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF LOOKING

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.606
AT WHAT AMENITIES ARE LOCATED

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:27.275
CLOSE TO THOSE ZONES --

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.210
AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.711
USUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.679
THE SHELTERS THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.481
IDENTIFIED SUB.

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.182
AS YOU AS YOU ALLUDED TO IN

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.317
HOUSING ELEMENT AS THEY WERE

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.052
OFTEN THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW A

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:38.887
SITE WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:39.688
CURRENT USE HAD SOME

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.923
REDEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OR AND

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.658
THAT STILL OCCURS AND SB TWO

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:44.926
SITES ARE THE SITES THAT ARE

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.294
IDENTIFIED FOR EMERGENCY

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.429
SHELTERS WHERE.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.697
YES MAYBE THERE'S A CURRENT USE

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.732
THERE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT THAT

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.601
THAT USES INCOMPATIBLE WITH

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.336
EMERGENCY SHELTERS SO WILL OKAY

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:55.704
IT -- AND SO

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.239
TIGHTENING THOSE REQUIREMENTS

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:58.874
PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE USEFUL

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.342
ESPECIALLY NOW IF THERE IS SOME

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:02.544
FUNDING AVAILABLE TO BUILD THOSE

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:03.045
SHELTERS.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.113
WITH UP TO HAVE A FURTHER

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.248
CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:06.715
THANK YOU.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:10.185
OTHER QUESTIONS CALL YES CENTER

QUICKLY WAS FELDMAN.

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.557
THERE SEEM TO BE A KIND OF A I

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.059
DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL IT A

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:17.926
IN EQUITY OR CHEAP SHOT AWHILE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.728
BACK.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.998
A VERY MINUSCULE CITY IN THE

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.366
AREA THAT I REPRESENT WAS

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.001
SINGLED OUT NOT MEETING THEIR

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.502
REQUIREMENTS.

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:29.938
IT'S  RURAL COUNTY IT'S A VERY

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.640
IN COBB WRIST AREA.

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:32.908
THE CITY HAS VERY LIMITED

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:35.243
RESOURCES.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.479
AND THEY'RE DOING.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.848
BUT TRYING.

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.882
TO BEAT THE GAME.

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:43.085
A VERY WEALTHY COUNTY.

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.519
IN THE BUDGET SLIPPED IN A

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:46.354
PROVISION EXTENDING THEIR

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:49.057
ELEMENT MANY YEARS.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.759
SEEMS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT WOULD

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:52.260
OBJECT TO THAT.

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.763
THAT KIND OF A THAT CERTAINLY IS

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.431
NOT EQUITABLE.

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:58.100
AND THEN LET A A VERY WEALTHY

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.335
COUNTY JUST EXTENDED FOR A LONG

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.369
PERIOD OF TIME THERE MAY BE SOME

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.638
VERY LEGITIMATE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:04.372
BUT WHEN I HEARD AND BUDGET

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:05.040
COMMITTEE.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.741
THAT WAS NOT CONVINCING DOES

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:09.211
THAT HAPPEN A LOT.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.679
I MIGHT FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.747
DOES NOT NESTLE HAPPEN A LOT BUT

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:15.517
THE IDEA OF KIND OF STRONGER

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.519
JURISDICTIONS PUSHING SOME OF

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.121
THE RENO REQUIREMENT ON SMALLER

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:20.555
JURISDICTIONS KIND OF TRADING

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:23.325
BETWEEN THAT RENO ALLOCATION.

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.327
YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT INFLUENCE

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.962
WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT SO THAT IF A

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.396
STRONGER JURISDICTION IS SAYING.

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:29.998
ARMENIA ALLOCATION IS THIS

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.266
NUMBER AND WE CERTAINLY

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.367
APPRECIATE IT IF SOME OF THE

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.869
SMALLER JURISDICTIONS WOULD TAKE

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.138
ON SOME OF THAT REQUIREMENT THAT

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.439
KIND OF TRADING HAS OCCURRED.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.307
AND IN OF A JURISDICTION DOESN'T

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.208
HAVE RESOURCES FOR THE PLANNING

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.244
STAFF AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.446
BE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A HOUSING

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:45.814
ELEMENT TO MEET THAT NEED.

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.816
YOU KNOW THAT CREATES A HEAVIER

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.585
BURDEN ON THEM BUT DAYS NOT

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.920
NECESSARILY.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:54.022
IN DETERMINING WHAT THE OVERALL

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.690
HOUSING NEED NUMBERS ARE YOU AND

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:56.725
I WOULD ARGUE THAT SUCH.

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.260
KIND OF REAL FOUNDED POLICY

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.362
BECAUSE IT THE IT DOES NOT MAKE

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.197
SENSE OF THE SMALLER ENTITY DOES

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:04.599
NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO RESOURCES

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:06.368
AND WHATEVER THEY COULD TRADE.

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.271
TO ADD TO THE ABILITY OF THE

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.473
RELIEF TO A LARGER MORE WEALTHY

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.407
COUNTY IT.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.377
IT'S BEEN INFINITESIMAL THE YES

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:16.878
AND AND THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.080
THAT THAT PROBLEM WILL BE

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.949
COMPLETELY ELIMINATED BUT AT

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.851
LEAST A REGION --

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.486
PERFORMING AS ALLOCATION FOR

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.254
THIS NEXT CYCLE WOULD HAVE O

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.223
DOCUMENT HOW THOSE NUMBERS DOT

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.926
THERE SO AND YOU KNOW IT IF IT'S

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.093
GOING TO BE POLITICAL.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.495
DECISION MAKING LIKE THAT THEY

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:34.529
WOULD HAVE.

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:35.897

ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE STATUTORY

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.538
FACTORS I TALKED ABOUT.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.240

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:35.724
SITE.

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.492
I THINK ON THE OTHER AND I NEED

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.262

CITY THAT HAS LOW DENSITY BUT

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:08.757
THEY BUILD.

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.159
LARGE SQUARE FOOTAGE.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.962
HOUSING NO SINGLE FAMILY

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:14.262

[inaudible]

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.435
SMALLER.

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:23.405

THERE'S NO WAY OF JUDGING

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:33.782
WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY CAN --

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:38.253
HAVE A LAND USE OF DECISION.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.089

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.692
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:44.559
COMPARED TO BUILDING --

SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET --

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:59.074
MAN SOMEBODY'S GOT SOME NUMBER I

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.742
THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.710
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.645
SO SO LIKE.

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.513

HOUSING I DON'T SEE ANY? TWENTY

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:09.784
SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:12.887
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS I SEE.

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:15.190
THOSE ARE SMALLER HOUSING UNITS.

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:15.890
IT -- IF YOU

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.459

NOT SERVE THE COULD BE

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.263
AFFORDABLE IT MAY NOT FULLY

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.533
ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN BUT IN THAT

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.035
HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS --

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.304
THEY ARE THIS JURISDICTION HAS%

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:30.672
THEIR RENA'S ACTUALLY FOUR

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.674
SEPARATE NUMBERS A VERY LOW

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.776
INCOME A LOW INCOME A MODERATE

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.544
AND ABOVE MODERATE GOAL.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.246
THEY DO NEED TO SHOW US ZONING

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.714
FORCE.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.984
SMALLER UNITS DENSER UNITS. TO

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.519
MEET THEIR LOWER INCOME SIDE OF

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.288
THEIR RECALL SO THAT THEY CAN'T

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:47.989
THEY CAN'T COUNT.

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:52.727
ON SINGLE FAMILY ZONING FOR A

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.129
FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.363
TOWARD THEIR VERY LOW.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.132
WIENER CARMEN AT THE HOUSING

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.634
ELEMENT AT THE PLANNING STAGE.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.835
SO HANNAH HANNAH DEVELOPER CAME

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:03.304
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CD PLAYED.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.240
FOR A DEVELOPMENT A SMALLER CITY

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:06.808
IN.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:07.642
HE HAD --

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.077
PRESENTED THE CITY WITH. TWO

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:10.345
OPTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:12.714
THE YOU KNOW KIND OF A SMALL

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.048
PIECE OF PROPERTY.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.583
HE SAID --

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.018
ONE OF THE OPTIONS HAD TWO

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:19.387
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT --

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:22.023
TOWN HOMES.

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.625
THE WAS GONNA SELL FOR QUITE A

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:24.626
BIT OF MONEY.

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:24.893
THERE --

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:28.663
OPTION WOULD BE TO HAVE. TWO

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.864
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT TOWN HOMES

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.566
AND PART OF THE PROPERTY AND THE

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:32.700
OTHER PART.

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:35.003
HAVE -- ONE

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.405
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT TOWN HOMES.

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:40.675
IN OTHER WORDS HAVE A MIX OF

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.044
AFFORDABILITY AND HE WAS GOING

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:43.344
[inaudible]

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.814
TO HAVE THOSE. FOUR EIGHT A

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.782
LOWER AMOUNT HE HAD.

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:48.316
YEAH I THINK --

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:50.752
ACTUALLY A VERY SLIGHT INCREASE

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.520
IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS BUT

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:53.788
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE SQUARE

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.190
FOOTAGE.

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.425
IT WAS ACTUALLY LOWER.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.461
SQUARE FOOTAGE.

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:00.962
WITH THE ONE THAT HAD THE MORE

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:02.397
UNITS THAN --

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.632
THE THE ONE I HAD ALL THE TWO

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:05.867
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT UNITS.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.536
SO I THINK I THINK FOR ME FOR ME --

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.171
WHEN THEY SAY THEY CAN'T BUILD?

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.307
THEY HAVE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:14.409
FOOT UNIT IS IT'S KIND OF A OKAY

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:17.011
YOU'RE NOT REALLY.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:20.315
CREATING A YOU HAVE OPTIONS.

NOT YOU WANT TO MAKE A HIGHER

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.119
PROFIT IS WHAT I'VE.

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.888
THAT'S THE OPTION IS NOT ABOUT

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.790
SUBSIDIES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT --

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.960
I CAN MAKE MORE MONEY IF I SO.

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.761
THE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.697
HOUSING UNIT.

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:36.831
BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.132
COULD BILL THE OTHER OPTION THE

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:41.269
ONE WITH THE ONE THOUSAND SQUARE

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.237
FOOT OPTION THEY JUST WOULD MAKE

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.973
AS MUCH MONEY.

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.741
YOU KNOW SO I I THINK THAT'S A

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:50.111
FOR ME. FOR ME A AN ISSUE.

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.045
WITH THE RAIN AND THE RATE OUGHT

01:25:51.112 --> 01:25:52.647
TO HAVE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:56.684
THE OF THE HOUSING UNITS.

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.486
HOW HOW MANY HOW MANY UNITS WERE

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:00.121
BUILT WHAT SQUARE FOOTAGE

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:00.421
[inaudible]

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:04.392
AND HOW MUCH THE UNITS COSTS OF

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:08.530
COURSE THAT'S THE VALUE ISSUE.

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:10.265
THANK YOU AND THERE IS A A BILL

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:11.432

MEMBER WORKS INTRODUCED THE COP

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.937
THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSING

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:16.437
ELEMENT.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.840
ELEMENT THAT CAN BE SINGLE

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:19.440
FAMILY HOMES SOME [inaudible]

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:22.110
THE I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IN A

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:23.344
LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES MISTER

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.979
CHAIRMAN IS THERE'S THERE'S A

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.548
LOT OF THESE VERY X. THEY'RE

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.349
TRYING TO BUILD VERY EXPENSIVE

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.984
CONDOS OKAY AS WHAT'S GOING ON

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.185
IN AT LEAST IN MY AREA.

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.820
THERE THERE HIGH DENSITY BUT

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.355
THERE.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.690
VERY EXPENSIVE HIGH DENSITY

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:39.060
CONDOS MILLION DOLLAR CONDOS.

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:40.962
THERE TOWARD THAT ARE TWO

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.730
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CONDO SUIT

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.332
VERY HIGH DENSITY.

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:45.533
AND I THINK I THINK WHEN THEY

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.602
HAVE THESE HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.902
[inaudible]

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:53.374
OF THE CITY COULD INSTILL A RAN

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:58.246
A FACTOR. TO MEET THE GOALS OF

01:26:58.313 --> 01:26:59.948
SIMPLY SAYING WE WANT TO MIX.

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:02.450
WE WHAT WE WATER MIX OF TYPES OF

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.419
UNITS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.087
AFFORDABILITY IN YOUR PROJECT

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:06.387
[inaudible]

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:09.257
AND THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:10.358
SOMETHING THAT I HOPE WOULD

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.961
HAPPEN -- IN

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:16.764
THE PROCESS OF WITH ARENA RITA

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.533
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.835
I WOULD I WOULD SAY THE TWO

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:21.569
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CONDOS

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.938
UNDERMINES DENSITY BECAUSE IT

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:25.073
MEANS THAT FEWER UNITS.

OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.502
IN THIS CHART SHOWS YOU WHAT

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:42.537
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:43.971
STATE SO WE'RE TRYING.

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:45.339
TO ACHIEVE NINETEEN NINETY

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:46.107
LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.309
EMISSIONS BY THE YEAR TWENTY

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:48.876
TWENTY ACCORDING TO THE AIR

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:49.977
RESOURCES BOARD WE ALREADY

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.379
ACHIEVED THAT GOAL FOUR YEARS

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.114
EARLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:53.681
GOOD NEWS.

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.149
BUT WE HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE GOAL

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:56.751
TO REDUCE THOSE EMISSIONS

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:59.053
FURTHER 40% BELOW NINETEEN

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.122
NINETY LEVELS BY THE YEAR TWENTY

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:03.758
THIRTY AND THEN 80% BELOW BY.

TWENTY FIFTY SO THESE ARE

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:05.693
AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND IF YOU LOOK

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.328
AT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.163
CALIFORNIA YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:10.731
SIDE FROM THE AIR RESOURCES

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:10.932
BOARD.

OVER 40%.

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.901
COME FROM TRANSPORTATION IF YOU

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:16.204
FACTOR IN OIL REFINERY EMISSIONS

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.472
IT'S CLOSER 250% THAT MEANS HALF

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.807
OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:22.109
IN CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY COME

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:23.644
FROM DRIVING.

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.612
WHEN OUR HAVE LAND USE PATTERNS

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.681
ARE A BIG FACTOR IN ALL THAT

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:28.115
DRIVING THAT WE DO NOT MANY

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:29.650
PEOPLE SAY WELL WE CAN SIMPLY

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:32.520

TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:34.956

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:36.524
USE PATTERNS AT ALL --

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:37.458
BUT THIS CHART HERE FROM THE

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:39.760
SCOPING PLAN SHOWS THAT WE STILL

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:42.230
NEED ABOUT 15%.

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.232
VMT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:31:44.298 --> 01:31:46.100
REDUCTIONS PER CAPITA --

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.035
BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY EVEN IF

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:49.937
WE HAD A 100% ZERO EMISSION

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.706
VEHICLE SALES AND THAT'S NOT

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.807
EVEN INCLUDING THE CARBON

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.876
BENEFITS OF HAVING MORE INFILL

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.777
FOCUSED DRIVING --

01:31:56.844 --> 01:32:00.414
IN LAND USE PATTERNS BECAUSE AS

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:03.951
WE BUILD MORE IN OUR OPEN SPACE

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.253
FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:06.821
AGRICULTURAL LANDS FOR CARBON

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.589
SEQUESTRATION SO WE HAVE MANY

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:10.658
REASONS I SHOULD SAY EVEN IF YOU

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.692
DON'T CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.894
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SHOULD

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.128
MATTER TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.796
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.298
WE ALL HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.000
AND LOCALIZED AIR POLLUTION AND

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.269
OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE.

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:22.536
SO WE'RE NOT DOING VERY WELL IN

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:23.537
THE SCORE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:24.872
CHART OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:25.973
YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.475
INCREASING SINCE THE GREAT

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.477
RECESSION WE'RE KIND OF BACK.

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:31.045
TO BUSINESS AS USUAL.

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:33.047
WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:34.682
PATTERNS AND OUR EXISTING

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:36.617
URBANIZED AREA THIS IS A CHART

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:38.252
FROM STUDY THAT WE DID OUR

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:39.353
CENTER ALONG WITH THE TURNER

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.521
CENTER AND HEARD FROM DAVID

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:41.622
GARCIA EARLIER.

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.190
THAT MODELED WHAT IT WOULD LOOK

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.892
LIKE IF WE BUILT TWO MILLION

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.993
HOMES APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.595
HOMES THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.396
WHICH IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:50.164
FINANCE WAS TELLING US WE NEEDED

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.098
TO BUILD.

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:52.500
WHAT IF WE FOCUSED ALL THAT

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.835
GROWTH IN LOW VEHICLE MILES

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.137
TRAVELED AREAS?

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.705
OR AREAS THAT WERE THREE MILE

01:32:57.772 --> 01:32:59.473
RADIUS FROM AIL STATION SO

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.741
THAT'S WHAT THIS MAP SHOWS

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.077
ACROSS CALIFORNIA THIS IS 4% OF

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.545
THE STATE'S LAND AREA WHERE WE

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.746
CAN ACCOMMODATE.

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.648
THESE TWO MILLION NEW UNITS THE

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:08.215
AND WE'RE PRETTY MODERATE

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.483
ASSUMPTIONS RUSSIAN SAID THIS IS

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:10.918
ALL ABOUT HIGHRISES THIS WAS A

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.821
MIX OF SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:16.090
FAMILY.

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:16.724
BUT CERTAINLY GO BACK A SLIGHT

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:17.558
HERE THIS IS A ZOOMED IN VIEW

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.293
HERE JUST TO SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.329
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WE

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:22.763
FOUND THAT IF YOU BUILT.

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.466
OUR HOMES IN THESE AREAS THESE

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.535
URBANIZED AREAS NEAR TRANSIT WE

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.136
COULD REDUCE OUR CARBON

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:30.771
EMISSIONS BY ALMOST TWO MILLION

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:33.507
METRIC TONS EQUIPMENT TO TAKING

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.108
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.476
OFF THE ROAD EVERY YEAR AND THIS

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:36.677
IS JUST FROM NEW RESIDENTIAL

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:39.313
DEVELOPMENT THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.514
IF WE PUT OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:41.415
THE BENEFITS TO EXISTING

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.683
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS FROM

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.952
HAVING MORE AMENITIES CLOSER AND

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:46.487
IT ALSO PRODUCE HIGHER ECONOMIC

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.456
GROWTH AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.358
HOUSING COSTS SO A LOT OF

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.226
REASONS NOT TO WANT TO BUILD IN

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.427
THESE COMMUNITIES EVE IN THESE

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.662
AREAS EVEN IF YOU.

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:55.997
DIDN'T CARE AGAIN ABOUT ABOUT

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.832
CLIMATE CHANGE SO IN TERMS OF

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.567
HOW WE GET TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.235
IN THESE AREAS I WANTED TO TALK

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.237
ABOUT THREE SPECIFIC POLICIES

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.805
THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FROM A

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.207
STATE PERSPECTIVE.

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.775
BECAUSE WE SEE HOSTILITY TO NEW

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.477
HOUSING GROWTH IN MANY OF THESE

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.579
AREAS AND IT'S MOSTLY THE FORM

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.314
OF ZONING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.415
EARLIER BUT MANY COMMUNITIES

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:15.816
HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:20.154
LOCAL ZONING POLICIES WHICH ARE.

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:21.822
BUT MANY PEOPLE MOVE TO EXPAND

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:23.024
ESPECIALLY THE HIGHER INCOME

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.558
COMMUNITIES NOT REALLY WANTING

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.626
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO CHANGE NOT

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:26.827
EXPECTING MORE GROWTH AND

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:27.995
THEY'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.230
ALLOWING NEWCOMERS TO TAKE

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.364
ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY HAVE IN

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.365
THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:32.767
SO I WOULD COMMEND SENATOR

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:34.969
WIENER FOR SB FIFTY WHICH IS A

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.604
FOLLOW UP TO SB EIGHT TWENTY

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:37.638
SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR WHICH I

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:38.205
THINK IS THE RIGHT TYPE OF

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:39.040
APPROACH.

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.307
WHERE WE NEED TO ESSENTIALLY

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:42.376
OVERRIDE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS ON

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:44.912
HOUSING PARTICULARLY AROUND

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.247
TRANSIT NOTES?

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:47.081
AND I I WOULD JUST POINT OUT

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:48.783
THAT THE TERMS OF THE DAMAGE

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.051
THAT SINGLE FAMILY.

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.185
ZONING HAS DONE IF YOU LOOK AT

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:53.287
LOS ANGELES TWO THIRDS OF LOS

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.256
ANGELES IS ZONED SINGLE FAMILY

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:57.858
HOUSING BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY

01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:59.093
THREE THAT WAS ONLY 5%.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.261
AND I WOULD BET YOU MOST OF THE

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.695
GREATEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.097
ANGELES ARE PROBABLY IN THOSE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:05.633
AREAS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE.

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:06.600
NINETEEN THIRTY THREE POLICE

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:08.135
LAID OUT BEFORE.

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:08.736
NINETEEN THIRTY THREE I ALSO

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.204
THINK WE NEED TO RELAX THE

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.939
PERMITTING PROCESS --

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:12.873
IN TERMS OF GETTING THESE OF

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.675
THESE HOMES APPROVED THROUGH THE

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:15.943
PROCESS SEES AT THE LOCAL

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.278
GOVERNMENT SET UP YOU HEAR A LOT

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:18.079
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:19.447
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BEING

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.482
A BARRIER. TO NEW HOUSING WILL A

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.583
LOT ABOUT A SELF INFLICTED A

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.118
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY ADD IN SO

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.252
MANY DISCRETIONARY REVIEW

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:26.787
PROCESS SEES.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:27.955
AND MY COLLEAGUE --

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.090
PROFESSOR BIEBER A BERKELEY LAW

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.291
HAS COME OUT WITH SOME SOME

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.459
STUDIES ON THIS WHICH WOULD BE

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.127
HAPPY TO SHARE AND BECAUSE THEY

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:34.795
HAD AN ALL THIS DISCRETION.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:37.598
THAT TRIGGER SEQUENCE THAT THESE

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.468
ARE MINISTERIAL I ALSO COMMEND

01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:42.703
SENATOR SKINNER FOR SB --

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.437
THREE THIRTY WHICH INTRODUCED

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:45.306
WHICH HELPS TO IT --

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:47.007
BASICALLY PUT  CAP ON THE

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:48.642
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT WOULD

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:49.810
PASS THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT

01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:50.878
WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR THESE

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:52.446
LOCAL APPROVALS BECAUSE THAT

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:53.747
ALSO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IT'S

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.249
THE ZONING BUT THEN IT'S ALSO

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:56.584
THE APPROVAL PROCESS SEES.

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:57.785
AND THEN JUST LASTLY I WOULD

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.453
POINT OUT THE NEED FOR A

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.455
FINANCING ASSISTANCE NOT ALL OF

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.390
THESE AREAS ARE IN HIGH INCOME.

01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:04.725
HIGH GROWTH HIGH JOB GROWTH

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.527
AREAS THERE IN COMMUNITIES THAT

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.628
HAVE -- VERY

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:08.863
UNDERSERVED IN TERMS OF

01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:10.698
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED A LOT

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.133
OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO ATTRACT

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.434
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT TO THESE

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.002
AREAS SO THINKING ABOUT A

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.804
REDEVELOPMENT TWO POINT NO TAX

01:36:16.871 --> 01:36:18.072
INCREMENT FINANCING.

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.673
THAT TYPE OF APPROACH WOULD BE --

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.509
WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE QUITE

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:21.809
SIMPLY PUT.

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:22.810
SEC.

01:36:22.877 --> 01:36:24.044
THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:25.613
APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA WITH AUTO

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.314
ORIENTED HOUSING GROWTH AND

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.650
CLOGGED HIGHWAYS AND ROADWAYS IS

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.652
SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE TO MEET

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:33.420
OUR LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS OR

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:35.422
THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE NEED

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.790
TO SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:38.058
AND WHAT THAT'LL ALL CLOSE AND

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.527
HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.095

AS WE HAVE EACH OF OUR

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:47.201
PRESENTERS.

WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE IT

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.622
EASIER FOR SAN DIEGANS FIND

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.391
SOMEWHERE TO LIVE 50% OF SAN

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:11.725
DIEGANS CAN'T AFFORD THE HOME

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:12.826
THAT THEY LIVE IN.

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:14.495
THEY NEED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:15.162
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SALARY IN

SO I AM SAN DIEGO HAS CAPITALIZE

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:23.504
ON THE CHANGES THAT THE STATE

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:25.139
LEGISLATURES IMPLEMENTED LAST

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.707
SEVERAL SESSIONS INCLUDING

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.409
PERMITTING OUR GRANNY FLATS

MOVING TOWARD BUILDING.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:08.141

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.184
SENIORS WHO ARE ABLE TO LIVE

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.018
LONGER INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:18.352
HOMES.

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:19.987
AND WE SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.421
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS OR HAVE

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.624

THEIR HOME

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:51.485
.

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.986
BUT WE WHAT WE ALSO SEE ON THE

01:44:53.053 --> 01:45:10.404
OTHER END OF THAT

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:35.962
AROUND THE

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:36.930
ISSUES AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF

PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED.

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.768
BUT BUT OUR LAND USE --

01:45:41.835 --> 01:45:43.904
AVAILABILITY IS TO ADDRESS THE

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:46.707
ISSUE AND THAT THEIR NEW THERE

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.441
NEEDS TO BE INNOVATIVE ZONING

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:48.775
SOLUTION AND REGULATIONS THAT

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:49.843
EXPEDITE THE PRODUCTION OF

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.811
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:45:50.877 --> 01:46:15.502
AND THEN STUDIES TO SORT OF HOW

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:20.540
HOW THIS IS THE FIRST ONE IS A

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:22.375
PROJECT THAT WE ARE FINISHING

01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:24.377
CONSTRUCTION ON AND SOUTH LOS

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:25.812
ANGELES RULING CURRY'S GARDENS.

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.080
WHAT WAS REALLY --

01:46:27.147 --> 01:46:28.181
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS FROM A

01:46:28.248 --> 01:46:29.182
LAND USE PERSPECTIVE SO THIS IS

01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:30.784
THE GENTRIFYING NEIGHBORHOOD

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.352
RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU SEE WHERE

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:33.019
WE'VE SEEN A GREAT LOSS OF

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:33.587
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THIS

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:34.454
PARTICULAR PROPERTY WAS ON THE

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:34.855
MARKET.

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.389
AND COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:37.491
MARKET RATE HOUSING SO ARE OUR

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:38.191
GOALS HERE WAS TO PRESERVE

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:39.793
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN THIS

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.927
COMMUNITY. TO INCREASE DENSITY

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:42.162
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE SLIDE

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:43.463
IT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:44.464
FROM THE ACTUAL SITE.

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.099
INTO COMBAT GENTRIFICATION THAT

01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:46.566
WAS HAPPENING IN THAT

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:47.100
NEIGHBORHOOD THROUGH LOCAL

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:48.068
ZONING AND LAND USE WE WERE ABLE

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:50.403
TO TAKE HIS FORTY EIGHT YOU NAY

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:51.338
GARDEN STYLE APARTMENT.

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:52.572
AND AND DEVELOP A HUNDRED AND

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:53.507
FORTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:55.108
AT REDUCE PARKING INCORPORATED

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:57.010
COMMUNITY FACILITY IT'S A GREAT

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.078
PROJECT BUT IT HAD SOME

01:46:58.145 --> 01:46:59.446
CHALLENGES AND I THINK IT'S

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:00.614
CHALLENGES THAT LAND USE COULD

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.616
DEFINITELY ADDRESS.

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.184
WE HAD A LINK THE LINK THE

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:06.953
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS EVEN AFTER

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:10.090
SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:12.459
AND THERE WAS AN APPEALS PROCESS

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:14.361
THAT THE AND EXTENDED THE THE

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.929
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY.

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:18.131
SO THIS PROJECT REQUIRED AS OWN

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:19.399
CHANGE GENERAL PLAN AND THEN

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.001
MATT AND WE ALSO UTILIZE THE

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:22.869
DENSITY BONUS.

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:28.942
IF ANY AND IF IT WERE ENDING

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:32.679
CONSTRUCTION DOWN [inaudible]

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:36.449
THE VOTE WE COULD HAVE DELIVERED

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:40.253
pWE THINK ABOUT LAND USE AND THE

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.688
PRESENTATION YOU SAW FROM MR

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:44.124
GARCIA EARLIER.

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:44.891
AND HEARD TODAY IT'S JUST THE

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.793
THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.995
AVAILABILITY OF MULTI FAMILY

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.931
HOUSING ZONE FOR MULTI FAMILY.

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:52.799
AND THEN ARE NEED TO GO THROUGH

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.234
THE PROCESS SO ONE OF THE THINGS

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.502
THAT YOU KNOW AS I'VE LOOKED AT

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:56.770
POLICY IS.

01:47:56.837 --> 01:48:00.373
CAN WE LOOK AT WAYS T. TO DEAL

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.142

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.809
PLAN BY.

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.144
NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE ISOLATED

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:05.812
SITE BUT WHAT'S PRECEDENT IN THE

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:07.047
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR HOW.

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:09.182
THINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AGAIN

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:10.217
THIS SITE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD BILL

AND THIRTIES PRIMARILY SINGLE

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.389
FAMILY DUPLEXES BUT OVER TIME

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:17.958
IT'S BEGAN TO DEVELOP AT THE

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.426
CHASE IMPARTS PARCELS WERE JUST

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:20.493
NOT THERE YET.

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.095
IS THERE A WAY --

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:23.763
TO TO SOME PRECEDENTS OWNING NOT

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.065
JUST BASED UPON THE ADJACENT

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:26.733

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:40.660
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS --

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:41.528
HELP SOLVE BOTH OF THOSE

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:42.862
PROBLEMS THE LAND IS ALREADY

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:44.597
DEVELOPED WE KNOW WHERE IT IS

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:46.399
AND THEY TEND TO BE EITHER

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:47.867
SMALLER UNITS ARE DEVELOPED

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:49.636
WITHIN STRUCTURES THAT ALREADY

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:51.938
EXISTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.139
OPPOSITION IS IS LESS AND

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.441
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:51:54.507 --> 01:51:56.109
THROUGHOUT EACH OF THE PANELS.

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:58.211
ABOUT EQUITY AND I BELIEVE

01:51:58.278 --> 01:51:59.446
EIGHTY USE ASO HAVE THE

01:51:59.512 --> 01:52:01.614
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS --

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.383
EQUITABLE ASPECTS OF LAND USE

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:05.118
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT I'M TO

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:07.120
THE EXTENT THAT EIGHTY USE ARE

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:08.855
DEVELOPED IN AREAS THAT HAVE

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.623
HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN ACCESSIBLE

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:12.992
AND AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE PRICES.

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:15.762
THAT INCREASES OPPORTUNITIES --

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:16.863
TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT THAT WOULD

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:19.866
NOT OTHERWISE BE IN THOSE AREAS --

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.501
ALSO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.936
ARE.

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.170
LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OR

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:26.339
HOMEOWNERS IN AREAS THAT

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:28.341
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN UNDER

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:29.042
SERVED --

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.343
DEVELOPING AN EIGHTY ON THEIR

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.078
PROPERTY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:33.880
TO BUILD EQUITY IN AN INCOME

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.482
STREAM SO --

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:37.717
IT CAN HELP ADDRESS AND KEEP

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:38.985
PEOPLE HOUSED.

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.653
IN THEIR THEIR LONG TERM

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.491
NEIGHBORHOODS --

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:45.792
BUT ALL OF THAT IS RELATED SURE

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:50.864
THAT IT'S THAT LOCAL --

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:54.200
EIGHT ARE REALLY INCREASING

01:52:54.267 --> 01:52:55.268
EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION IN THE

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.803
RIGHT PLACES AND INCREASING

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.138
AFFORDABILITY --

01:52:58.204 --> 01:52:59.906
I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:02.308
OF EXAMPLES OF I'M JURISDICTIONS

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.643
THAT I THINK ARE DOING --

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.112
GOOD GOOD EFFORTS.

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.380
TO PROMOTE EIGHTY YOU

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.515
DEVELOPMENT --

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.116
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF SANTA

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.751
ROSA.

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:13.386
AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO WAIVE

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:15.588
DEVELOPMENT FEES ON EIGHTY YEARS

01:53:15.655 --> 01:53:17.824
BUT ONLY FOR SMALLER EIGHTY USE

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:18.791
THAT CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:20.827
BUILD SMALLER UNITS WHICH AS WAS

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:21.995
DISCUSSED BEFORE ARE MORE

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:22.996
AFFORDABLE.

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:24.898
A LARGE EIGHTY YOU THERE'S NO

01:53:24.964 --> 01:53:25.899
GUARANTEE THAT IT WOULD BE

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:27.901
AFFORDABLE IT CAN RENT FOR AS

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:29.636
MUCH AS A MARKET RATE UNIT --

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:31.004
BUT CREATING INCENTIVES FOR

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.639
SMALL EIGHTY USE MAKES SENSE THE

01:53:32.705 --> 01:53:34.974
OTHER ADVANTAGE OF THAT STRATEGY

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.509
IS THAT A SMALLER EDU IS LESS

01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:37.744
LIKELY TO BURDEN THE

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.245
INFRASTRUCTURE ANDSERVICES IN A

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:41.314
JURISDICTION --

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:44.050
IF YOU'RE ALLOWING IT BUT BUT

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:44.884
TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AT

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:47.220
YOU THAT HAS THE SAME IMPACT IN

01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:49.222
MANY CASES AS A SMALL SINGLE

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:50.623
FAMILY HOUSE AND THAT'S THE

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.758
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE HOME I

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:55.128
LIVE IN BERKELEY AND THE

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:55.862
EXEMPTING THAT TYPE OF

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:57.197
DEVELOPMENT FROM FEES.

01:53:57.263 --> 01:54:00.099
DOESN'T MAKE AS MUCH SENSE SO --

01:54:00.166 --> 01:54:02.335
KEEPING AND USING THIS THEFEE

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:03.803
WAIVER AS A WAY TO CREATE AN

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.605
INCENTIVE TO DEVELOP SMALLER

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:07.607
MORE AFFORDABLE EIGHTY USE IS A

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:09.442
GREAT TOOL --

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:09.976
ALSO -- FROM

01:54:10.043 --> 01:54:11.678
IN THE SAME REGION BUT NAPA

01:54:11.744 --> 01:54:13.046
COUNTY --

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:16.482
HAS A LOAN PROGRAM HELP FINANCE

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:18.384
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TO USE AS

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:19.552
LONG AS THOSE EIGHTY USE OUR

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:22.422
DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:24.023
AND THAT HELPS CONTROL WHO HAS

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:26.492
ACCESS TO THEM AND WHO BENEFITS

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:27.126
FROM IT --

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:28.895
WHILE OFFSETTING THE COSTS TO

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:30.496
THE HOMEOWNERS --

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:33.166
ALSO BRING UP AN EXAMPLE FROM --

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:34.667
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:35.335
JURISDICTION OF AND SOME NEED US

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:38.004
ANOTHER ON THAT THE FORTY SEVEN

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:39.739
LIST BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:41.474
BEFORE BUT WHEN I AM EFFORT THAT

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:42.275
THEY'VE DONE THAT'S BEEN VERY

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:43.710
SUCCESSFUL TOWARDS PROMOTING

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.411
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:46.045
IS THERE --

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:48.014
CITY COMMISSION PRE APPROVED

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:50.917
PLANS FOR EIGHTY USE --

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:53.586
SO THEY HAVE A SUITE OF NINE

01:54:53.653 --> 01:54:55.221
DIFFERENT EDIE YOU PLAN SETS

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:57.457
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:58.758
THE PUBLIC THAT THEY KNOW HAVE

01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:00.760
BEEN PRE PERMITTED PRE APPROVED.

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:02.295
THEY CAN COME AND THEY HAVE TO

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:04.631
PAY FOR THEIR OWN --

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:05.598
LITERAL THEIR SITE DESIGN AND

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:06.833
THEIR ARCHITECT TO DO THE

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:08.501
CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS --

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:11.037
BUT IT SAVES TIME IT SAVES MONEY --

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:13.139
SO IT INCENTIVIZE THE CREATION

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:15.174
AND AT A LOWER COST FOR THE

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.342
HOMEOWNER --

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:22.982
SO AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WE

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:25.218
INCENTIVES --

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:26.319
I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT.

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.987
SOME.

01:55:28.054 --> 01:55:29.455
OTHER PLANNING PRINCIPLES THAT

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:30.623
RUN THROUGH GETTING GETTING

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:31.824
READY FOR EIGHTY YEARS AND

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:32.959
ACTUALLY SOME OF THEM APPLIED AT

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:34.927
THE STREAMLINING AND AND

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.462
CONVERSATIONS THAT --

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.798
SENATOR MCGUIRE WAS BRINGING UP

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.366
EARLIER IN THE THAT PANEL --

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:43.369
BUT ABOUT A CONTEXT SENSITIVITY.

01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:46.205
THE ANSWERS THAT WORK IN CERTAIN

01:55:46.272 --> 01:55:47.540
JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:49.375
THAT THAT WORK IN OTHERS AND

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:50.543
PARTICULARLY --

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:52.478
WITHIN RURAL PORTIONS OF THE

01:55:52.545 --> 01:55:53.746
STATE -- AS

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:56.049
AN ORGANIZATION AN EPA WOULD

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.184
WOULD SUPPORT --

01:55:58.251 --> 01:55:59.686
EIGHTY USE AND ALMOST ANY A ONE

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.287
SINGLE EIGHTY YOU IN ALMOST ANY

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:02.922
EXISTING STRUCTURE --

01:56:02.989 --> 01:56:04.657
BUT THEN LOOKING AT MORE

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:06.659
INTENSIFICATION THAN THAT AND

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:08.795
RURAL CONTEXT --

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:11.464
RUNS THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY.

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:13.533
ALLOWING TOO MUCH DEVELOPMENT

01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:14.567
OUTSIDE OF AREAS THAT ARE WELL

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.803
SERVED BY TRANSIT INCREASING V.

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:19.806
M. T. NGH T. EMISSIONS.

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.174
AND BEING IN CONFLICT WITH THE

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:25.678
AGRICULTURAL AND PRESERVATION

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:28.414
EFFORTS -- I

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:30.016
ALSO WANTED TO MENTION SIR THANK

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:30.850
YOU THE DIFFERENCE.

01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:31.584
BETWEEN.

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.452
URBAN AND RURAL WHEN IT COMES TO

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:34.087
SAFETY AND AND FIRE HAZARDS --

01:56:34.153 --> 01:56:38.024
ALLOWING INTENSIFIED DEVELOPMENT --

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:38.191
IN.

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:41.260
EVEN IF YOU TAKE AN X. --

01:56:41.327 --> 01:56:42.628
THE RULES THAT WORK THERE SHOULD

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:43.730
BE DIFFERENT THAN THE RULES IN

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:45.698
PARADISE --

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:47.133
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.334
THE LAST THING THAT I WILL I

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:49.969
WILL COVER --

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:51.204
BEFORE MY TIME EXPIRES IS.

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.706
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PLANNING

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:54.907
FOR GROWTH AND THAT PUTTING THE

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:58.077
GROWTH IN AREAS THAT CAN ABSORB-IT --

01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:00.012
ALLOWING EASY USE AGAIN AND

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:02.315
URBAN AREAS THAT ARE WELL SERVED

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:04.150
BY MUNICIPAL SERVICES MAKES A

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:05.485
LOT OF SENSE --

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:06.853
BUT THOSE SEEM RULES DON'T

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.388
NECESSARILY APPLY IN RURAL

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:11.190
CONTEXT WHERE WERE SERVED BY --

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:13.259
SEPTIC SIR WELL AND THEY CAN

01:57:13.326 --> 01:57:14.761
ABSORB THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.462
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK THAT

01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:18.965
THAT SAME CONCEPT RUNS THROUGH --

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:20.500
SOME OF THE THE STREAMLINING AND

01:57:20.566 --> 01:57:22.402
AND OTHER EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:22.935
THAT.

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:25.938
THE PLANNING FOR THE GROWTH IS

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:27.940
PART OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:29.242
GROWTH HAPPENS AND I'LL I'M

01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:31.544
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON

01:57:31.611 --> 01:57:33.946
ANY OF THOSE TOPICS THANK YOU SO

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:35.248
MUCH FOR SUPPOSED VERY GRATEFUL.

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:37.216
WITH A BIT OPEN IT UP FROM THE

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:41.754
COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY

01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:42.388
QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR START WITH

01:57:42.455 --> 01:57:44.791
SENATOR ABOUT.

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:45.658
I LIKE THE MEMBERS.

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:46.392
TO THE PANEL TO MAKE COMMENTS

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:47.660
ABOUT.

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.195
IN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A GOOD

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:50.696
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY YOU THINK

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.098
WE OUGHTA.

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:53.065
START LIVING IN SMALLER HOUSING

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:58.905
WHICH THE YOU KNOW LIKE.

01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:00.573
YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE WITH OKAY --

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.009
ALSO THIS BECAUSE I'M OLDER THAN

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:05.144
ALL YOU PEOPLE.

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:09.248
WHEN I WAS A KID --

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.116
YOU KNOW WE WE OF COURSE OUR

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:10.983
FAMILY WE HAD TWELVE IN OUR

01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:11.617
FAMILY BUT I FIGURED OUT IT WAS

01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:14.220
ABOUT. NINETY SQUARE FEET PER.

01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:14.954
PERSON IN OUR FAMILY I DON'T

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:17.056
KNOW.

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.524
SOME OF YOU LIVED IN THAT WITH

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:20.159
TWELVE PEOPLE ON A THREE BEDROOM

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:20.927
TWO BATH HOUSE [inaudible]

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.762
SO [inaudible]

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.096
YOU KNOW [inaudible]

01:58:24.163 --> 01:58:26.866
BUT BUT JUST THE WAY THE WAY

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:30.403
THIS SIZE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:32.104
THE HOUSING UNIT.

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:33.906
AND AND DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART

01:58:33.973 --> 01:58:35.942
OF THE PROBLEM.

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:39.011
WITH AFFORDABILITY IS THAT.

01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:40.513
THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE HAVE

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.182
THE IS JUST GETTING.

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.952
MORE OF THESE LARGE.

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:47.787
MORE EXPENSIVE THERE NEVER THERE

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:48.354
DOES KIND OF UNITS ARE NEVER

01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:49.155
GOING.

01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:52.425
TO FILTER DOWN.

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:54.494
TO AFFORDABILITY AT ALL YOU KNOW

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.796
THE ODD BUT I LIKE TO HEAR THE

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:59.065
COMMENTS ABOUT THE SIZE --

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:00.466
OF THE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:08.407
APPROVING CALIFORNIA.

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:09.408
WHERE THEY WERE GOING WELL I CAN

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:09.876
ADDRESSES RELIEF AN

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:11.377
ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE A

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:13.145
SMALLER UNIT IS DEFINITELY

01:59:13.212 --> 01:59:14.580
CARRYING ON A MUCH SMALLER?

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.815
CARBON FOOTPRINT --

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:16.883
YOU HAVE MUCH LESS --

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.585
ENERGY USAGE WATER USAGE AND IF

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:21.954
YOU'RE CLOSER TO JOBS SERVICES

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:24.390
RETAIL YOU CAN WALK BIKE TAKE

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:25.491
TRANSIT OR IF YOU DO HAVE TO

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:26.659
DRIVE OR NOT TO BE DRIVING AS

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:27.827
FAR AS IF YOU'RE IN AN OUTLYING

01:59:27.894 --> 01:59:28.761
AREAIN A BIGGER HOME.

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.696
SO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:33.399
THAT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE FOR

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:34.634
A HOUSING SCENARIO WHERE IF YOU

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.402
HAD A MORE COMPACT INFILL TYPE

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:38.504
OF HOUSING SCENARIO YOU COULD

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:39.739
SAY PEOPLE A LOT OF MONEY.

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:40.706
IN THE QUESTIONS WE DON'T WANNA

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.575
BE REQUIRING PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:44.076
THAT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT RIGHT

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:45.378
PEOPLE SO WILL CLIMATE POLICIES

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:46.612
GONNA REQUIRES ALL THE LIVE IN

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.147
SOME RABBIT HUTCH IN A IN A

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:49.282
DENSE HONG KONG LIKE CITY AND

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:50.116
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE

01:59:50.182 --> 01:59:51.350
TALKING ABOUT HERE TO MEET OUR

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:51.617
CLIMATE.

01:59:51.684 --> 01:59:53.219
GOALS IT'S REALLY NOT PROVIDING

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.021
THE OPTION OF A SMALLER UNIT

01:59:55.087 --> 01:59:56.355
THAT REDUCES PEOPLE NOT ONLY

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:57.557
THEIR ENERGY COSTS BUT THERE

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.358
TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO AND

01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:00.226
WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH OF

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:01.961
THOSE SMALLER UNITS I THINK IT'S

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:03.429
ABSOLUTE CORRECT THAT BECAUSE

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:05.698
OUR INFILL AREAS ARE MAJOR JOB

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:06.666
CENTERS HAVE.

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.267
RESTRICTED HOUSINGGROWTH IT'S

02:00:08.334 --> 02:00:09.869
PUSHED OUT HOUSING OUT TO EDGE

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:11.537
COMMUNITIES WHERE BUILDERS ARE

02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:13.439
BUILDING BIGGER PRODUCT BUT WHEN

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:14.540
YOU FACTOR IN THOSE ENERGY COSTS

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:15.975
AS TRANSPORTATION COSTS IT'S

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:17.410
PUTTING A HUGE SQUEEZE ON

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.078
CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE REALLY

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:19.779
STARTING TO HEMORRHAGE.

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:23.049
MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS AS A

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:24.750
RESULT.

02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:26.052
I JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THAT THANK

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:27.019
YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION I

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:28.354
AS NEAR QUESTION IN THE LAST

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.456
PANEL AS WELL AND ONE OF THE

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:31.924
WAYS THAT SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:33.292
TACKLE THIS IS TO TRY.

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:34.961
TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:37.396
OF SMALLER UNITS BY AM CHANGING

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:38.931
AND THE SCALE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:41.033
IMPACT FEES RIGHT NOW IT'S THE

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.301
SAME DEVELOPMENT IMPACT THE

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:43.536
WHETHER YOU BUILD A TEN THOUSAND

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:45.538
SQUARE FOOT UNIT OR SIX HUNDRED

02:00:45.605 --> 02:00:46.639
SQUARE FOOT UNIT.

02:00:46.706 --> 02:00:48.140
SO THAT'S A THAT'S A STUDY THAT

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.476
THAT WERE WORKING ON AND WE HOPE

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.311
TO TO CHANGE THOSE FEES TO

02:00:52.378 --> 02:00:54.246
INCENT THOSE SMALLER UNITS.

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:57.583
THANK YOU.

02:00:57.650 --> 02:00:59.719
THE THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO THE

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:00.119
QUESTION IS YES --

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:01.253
BUT BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.555
FROM AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:03.856
PERSPECTIVE AND WE'RE WE'RE

APPROPRIATE AND ME WE ARE

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:14.233
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND YOU

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:16.969
KNOW TWELVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED FOR

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:18.604
A THREE BEDROOM UNITS SO THAT'S

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.439
PROBABLY WHAT YOUR FAMILY WITH

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:21.807
US ONE HOUSE.

02:01:21.874 --> 02:01:23.809
RIGHT --

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:27.780
YOURS WAS THE 1-000-010-0050

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:30.483
SQUARE FEET SELECT A BRIGHT SO I

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:30.816
I FEEL LIKE --

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:32.151
SO HE'S DOING RIGHT WITHIN THE

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:33.419
AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDUSTRY

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:35.221
WE'VE DEFINITELY GOTTEN TO A

02:01:35.287 --> 02:01:36.422
PLACE OF BUILDING COMPACT

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:39.358
EFFICIENT UNITSTO MATCH THE

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:42.662
HOUSEHOLD CIDER POPULATION THAT

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.497
WERE SERVING.

02:01:44.563 --> 02:01:45.431
AND SERVED THERE'S A A FEW

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:46.666
THEMES THAT ARE BETTER AND PLAY

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:48.834
WITH AN EIGHT I TOUCHED ON ONE

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.336
OF THEM BRIEFLY WITH THE IN THE

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:51.971
EIGHTY YOU CONTEXT AS A SMALLER

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:54.640
EIGHTY YOU IS IS LESS LIKELY TO

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:55.541
MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFORDABLE AND

02:01:55.608 --> 02:01:56.475
LESS LIKELY TO BURDEN

02:01:56.542 --> 02:01:58.077
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN.

02:01:58.144 --> 02:01:59.545
THE SAME WAY A LARGER ONE WAY SO

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:01.981
THAT HAS A A DOUBLE BENEFIT

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:03.549
THERE -- BUT

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:05.084
IT AT THE SAME TIME --

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:06.419
TO PICK UP ON A LITTLE BIT OF

02:02:06.485 --> 02:02:07.753
WHAT MS HUGHES WAS JUST TALKING

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.422
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:02:09.488 --> 02:02:12.358
STILL PLANNING --

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:15.094
FOR FAMILIES AND AND AND HOW ONE

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:16.896
THIRD ONLY BE ONE HOUSING

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:19.198
TYPOLOGY OBVIOUSLY --

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:21.801
BEING ABLE TO BUILD MORE

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:22.134
EFFICIENTLY --

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.369
IS.

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:24.704
IS AN IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:26.872
STRATEGY TO OF CONTROLLING COSTS

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.841
AND INCREASING DENSITY TO

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:30.609
PROVIDE MORE OPTIONS --

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:32.044
BUT AT THE SAME THERE IF THERE

02:02:32.111 --> 02:02:33.879
IS.

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:36.282
IT WILL NEVER TOTALLY GO AWAY TO

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:38.050
HAVE HAVE THE DEMAND FOR LARGER

02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:40.219
UNITS ARE LUXURY UNITS THERE CAN

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:41.554
BE ROOM FOR THAT IN THE MARKET.

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.856
AS LONG AS THAT'S NOT COMING AT

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:45.991
THE EXPENSE OF MEETING THE OTHER

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.426
NEEDS THAT ARE ARE OUT THERE I

02:02:47.493 --> 02:02:48.327
THINK I THINK WHAT I'M SEEING IN

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:51.330
SAN JOSE AND SILICON VALLEY IS.

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:53.065
THERE'S A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:53.365
[inaudible]

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:54.800
FELICE E. [inaudible]

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.902
THE VALLEY.

02:02:56.969 --> 02:02:58.704
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LIVE IN AN

02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:01.107
AREA WHERE THERE IS.

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:02.641
THEY CAN BUY THEY CAN IT WENT TO

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.944
THEM AFFORDABILITY IS TO BUY --

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:05.845
A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:08.247
HOUSE.

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:10.449
YOU'RE ON THE MOVE OUT AND TRACY

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:11.951
ERRORS --

02:03:12.017 --> 02:03:13.552
MODESTO OR SOMEPLACE

02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:13.853
[inaudible]

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:15.921
PATTERSON OF THERE ARE MY

02:03:15.988 --> 02:03:17.289
COMMUTING AS LONG AS THEY GO

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:18.624
BACK TO THAT THREE THOUSAND

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:20.593
SQUARE FOOT HOUSE.

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:21.560
AND I THINK THERE'S SOME KIND OF

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:22.995
WITH THE SOME WRONG WITH THAT

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:24.029
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LIKE WE

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:25.564
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:27.566
TRANSPORTATION ALL THE THOSE

02:03:27.633 --> 02:03:29.702
KINDS OF THINGS AND WE HAVE TO

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:31.036
TURN AROUND TO REWARD PEOPLE

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:33.939
THAT -- ONE

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.341
LIVE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:38.711
ENVIRONMENT AND AND FROM A

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:41.013
PLANNING STANDPOINT SO.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.715
RESTAURANT THANK YOU NO THANK

STRATEGIC COURSE SPECIFIC

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:53.359
STRATEGIES AND THERE IS SOME

02:03:53.425 --> 02:03:55.027
TENSION BETWEEN LOOK LOCAL

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:56.428
GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE.

BILL IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.138
SAID EVERYBODY NEEDED TO EVERY

02:04:06.205 --> 02:04:07.673
CITY HAD THE PASSAGE.

A SECOND UNIT PORTENTS AND

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:11.811
EVERYBODY PASSED TO SET ALL FOUR

02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:12.478
HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES PASSED

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:13.813
SECOND UNIT ORDINANCE AND YOU

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.748
LOOK AT THAT FIFTEEN YEARS OR

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.817
TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN. TWO

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:19.318
THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:20.219
SIXTEEN BEFORE.

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:21.954
SB TEN SIXTY NINE GOT IT AND

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:24.490
THERE WAS LIKE ONE UNIT TO UNIT

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:26.258
ZERO UNITS ZERO UNITS SO THEY

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.427
ALL HAVE THESE BILL FELT GOOD

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:29.862
ABOUT THEIR LOSS TO DATE BUT

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:31.230
NOTHING GOT BUILT.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:36.969
SEDAN NOW GOING --

TO TO SIXTEEN LOCAL ORDINANCES

02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:40.105
FOUR EIGHT IF HE DIDN'T COMPLY

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:41.507
WITH TEN SIXTY NINE THEY DIDN'T

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:44.076
HAVE YOU KNOW THE REQUIRED --

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:45.244
PARKING IN THE BOOK PARKING WAS

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:48.147
REQUIRED WITHIN TRANSIT NONE THE

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:49.582
ROLLER IS BETWEEN TRANSIT.

02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:52.051
ONLY TWO HUNDRED OF THE FOUR

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:52.685
HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES HAVE

02:04:52.751 --> 02:04:55.621
PASS NEW EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES.

02:04:55.688 --> 02:04:57.389
FOR THE CAT NOT EVEN HALF SOME

02:04:57.456 --> 02:04:58.924
FOR COMPLYING WITH STATE LAWS

02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:00.993
BUT OTHERS USE WE SIT HERE ON

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.294
YEAR.

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:02.795
THREE AND SOME OF US ARE

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:05.364
CHATTERING ABOUT THE IMPACT FEES

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:07.199
TEN AND HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH I

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.567
BELIEVE IS NOT A GOOD INCENTIVE

02:05:08.634 --> 02:05:11.203
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT RESTRICTS.

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.805
HOW CAN YOU HELP US OUT WITH

02:05:12.872 --> 02:05:14.907
THIS STRATEGY WE IT SEEMS AS

02:05:14.974 --> 02:05:16.475
THOUGH WE'RE SAYING THIS IS WHT

02:05:16.542 --> 02:05:17.776
WE WANT YOU TO GO?

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:21.080

SISTER FINANCE.

02:05:22.948 --> 02:05:24.917
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN WE'VE

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.485
SAID YOUR YOUR LONG ANSWER FOR

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:27.820
YOU AND THEY'RE STILL PASSING

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:28.954
THEY'RE STILL IN FORCING TEN

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:33.559
THOUSAND MINIMUM LOT SIZE FOR AN

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:35.928
EIGHTY YOU FOR INSTANCE.

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:37.229
STRATEGY SOME ASSISTANCE I KNOW

02:05:37.296 --> 02:05:39.198
SAN DIEGO HAS ACTUALLY DONE A

02:05:39.265 --> 02:05:41.800
LOT OF OLD JOB.

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:42.268
IT WILL.

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:44.303
THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LAWS I THINK

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:45.304
WERE OBSERVER VERY EFFECTIVE I

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:45.938
MEAN YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THERE'S

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:48.641
NOT 1100% COMPLIANCE BUT THE

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:50.376
THERE'S BEEN A BLOOM AND EIGHTY

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:51.877
YOU CONSTRUCTION --

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:53.212
THROUGHOUT JURISDICTIONS AND

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:55.214
IT'S IT'S JUST RETURN THAT TO

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.649
PART OF THE CONVERSATION A LOT

02:05:56.715 --> 02:05:57.950
OF JURISDICTIONS.

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:58.884
BUT MAYBE HAD ONE ON THE BOOKS

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:02.554
BUT WERE IN NOW.

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:04.690
REINVESTED IN TRYING TO PROMOTE

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:06.926
THAT SO A THE ATTENTION THAT'S

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:08.527
BEEN RETURNED TO HIS BàN --

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.062
REALLY HELPFUL EIGHT I THINK

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:11.096
THAT -- IN

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:13.332
SOME WAYS.

02:06:13.399 --> 02:06:16.001
GIVING THEN THE THE LAWS THAT

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:18.037
ARE NOW ON THE BOOKS TIME TO

02:06:18.103 --> 02:06:20.072
WORK AND CONTINUE TO WORK.

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:22.608
IN THAT CONTEXT IS GOOD BUT

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:23.909
BROADENING YOU.

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.477
DO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.578
YOU.

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:28.480
MAKE SURE THAT JURISDICTION'S

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:29.248
ARE COMPLAINING I FEEL.

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:32.584
THAT --

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:34.420
ACTUALLY THE THE EIGHTY YOU THE

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:34.954
TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHTY YOU

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:36.288
LEGISLATION IS A GOOD MODEL

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:37.790
BECAUSE IT SET VERY SPECIFIC

02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:39.291
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ABOUT

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:41.126
WHERE THINGS NEEDED TO BE --

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:43.028
PERMITTED IT ALLOWED THE

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:45.331
JURISDICTION SOME DISCRETION TO

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.832
GO THROUGH A PLANNING PROCESS

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:47.967
AND COME UP WITH.

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:49.501
THEIR LOCAL STANDARDS BUT THEN

02:06:49.568 --> 02:06:51.103
ONCE THOSE WERE SAT IT'S A

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.538
MINISTERIAL TIME LIMITED

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:54.506
APPROVAL PROCESS THERE'S NO MORE

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:56.442
SEEK WEATHER'S NO MORE --

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:58.043
OPPORTUNITY FOR NAME BE

02:06:58.110 --> 02:07:00.779
INVOLVEMENT SO HAVING.

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:02.848
THE THAT SORT OF DYNAMIC BETWEEN

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.416
THE STATE'S SETTING PARAMETERS

02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:06.552
GIVING.

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:08.320
WITH SPECIFIC IN TIME

02:07:08.387 --> 02:07:10.956
REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES --

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.825
BUT GIVING CITIES THE

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:15.861
OPPORTUNITY THEN. TO TO COMPLY

02:07:15.928 --> 02:07:17.296
AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THE

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.764
STATE'S STANDARDS SET THE

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:20.399
BASELINE AND AND THEY'VE MISSED

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:22.067
OUT ON THEIR OPPORTUNITY.

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:23.969
THAT'S THEIR CHOICE THAT MODEL

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:26.205
SEEMS TO TO WORK PRETTY WELL IN

02:07:26.271 --> 02:07:28.507
TERMS OF CREATING --

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:29.475
AN INCENTIVE FOR CITIES TO

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:31.076
COMPLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:33.245
DO SOME PLANNING WORK AND THEN

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:34.880
HAVING --

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:37.049
CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DON'T.

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:39.351
SEE YOUR QUESTION GOES BEYOND

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:41.553
THE EIGHTY YEARS I'M I WOULD SAY

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.756
AND WORKING WITH ANY STATE

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.057
LEGISLATION THAT'S COME DOWN

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:48.794
LOCALLY FROM WAY BACK WITH SB

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:49.628
EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN TO OTHER.

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:50.963
SORT OF MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:55.100
THAT DEALT WITH IT YOU KNOW THE

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:55.901
EIGHTY SIX CITIES AT THE LA

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:58.103
COUNTY THEY ALL IMPLEMENTED VERY

02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.538
DIFFERENTLY.

02:07:59.605 --> 02:08:01.173
AND SOME CHOOSE --

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.441
TO DOT TEMPERAMENT THESE --

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:04.777
POLICIES SO I THINK THERE IS

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:05.778
THERE IS I THINK MORE THAT COULD

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:07.646
BE PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:09.181
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:10.549
AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND WHAT

02:08:10.616 --> 02:08:12.017
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES ONE

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:14.386
POLICIES ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED AND

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:16.855
MAYBE THERE'S A HOUSING.

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.657
SPECIALIST WITHIN THE ATTORNEY

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:19.858
GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT THAT'S YOU

02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:21.994
KNOW THEIR JOB IS TO LOOK AT HOW

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:24.563
LOCALITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING --

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:26.632
LAND USE POLICY BUT THE THE

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:29.101
OTHER THING IS CAN WE TIE

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:31.403
INCENTIVES OTHER FINANCIAL

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:33.672
INCENTIVES AT THE STATE LEVEL TO

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:35.541
AYE THEIR REWARD THROUGH CITIES

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:36.775
THAT ARE DOING RIGHT WELL AROUND

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:39.611
THOSE HOT THERE HOUSING POLICY

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.080
OR I DON'T WANT TO SAY --

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.514
PUNISH BUT YOU KNOW TÁI

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:43.682
INCENTIVES.

02:08:43.749 --> 02:08:48.287
TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE HOUSING

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:50.389
POLICIES AS WELL.

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:51.790
AND I THINK I JUST LIKE THE TO

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:52.724
QUICKLY ADD IN TERMS OF THE

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:55.227
STRATEGY AND WE WE ARE

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:55.894
PERMITTING A LOT MORE EIGHTY USE

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:56.462
NOW.

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:58.397
PREVIOUSLY WE PERMITTED A LOT OF

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:00.933
GUEST QUARTERS RIGHT SO THAT'S

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:03.335
THE SAME UNIT BUT WITHOUT THAT

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:04.837
KITCHEN FACILITY AND SO.

02:09:04.903 --> 02:09:06.338
PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.907
OF A LOCAL AND THE GUEST

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.476
QUARTERS THAT ACTUALLY DATA NOW

02:09:10.542 --> 02:09:10.976
HAVE.

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:12.211
KITCHENS --

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:13.445
IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.080
FEASIBILITY --

02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:18.050
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SET ASIDE --

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:18.717
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:19.785
OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO

02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:21.687
WAIVE THE WATER AND SEWER FEES

02:09:21.753 --> 02:09:23.722
CITY COUNCIL APPROVED WEIGHING

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.390
THAT ARE WAVING THAT THE DIFFIE

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:26.425
IS --

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:28.594
SANDBAG JUST WAVE TO OUR

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:31.130
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION FEE SO

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:32.264
WE'VE NOW WAVED.

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:34.233
UPWARDS OF TWENTY THOUSAND

02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:35.901
DOLLARS IN FEES AND IF SOMEONE

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:37.369
CAN CAPITALIZE ON IN CITY THIS

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.538
IS FREE DESIGN TEMPLATES MAYBE

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:40.973
THEY CAN SAVE ANOTHER TWENTY

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.074
THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE SO WE'VE

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:43.308
JUST SHAVED FORTY GRAND.

02:09:43.375 --> 02:09:45.277
OFF OF THE PROXIMATE HUNDRED

02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:46.979
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD AN

02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:48.447
EIGHTY SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:50.282
SIGNIFICANT AND I I DEFINITELY

02:09:50.349 --> 02:09:53.152
THINK THAT THOSE NUMBERS WILL

02:09:53.218 --> 02:09:54.353
CONTINUE.

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:55.687
I THINK A LOT OF GREAT POINTS

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:58.423
HERE RAISED I WOULD JUST SAY YOU

02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.191
DESCRIBE AS ATTENTION CENTER

02:09:59.258 --> 02:09:59.925
RIGHT HOUSE GIVE ME A LOT OF IS

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:01.360
KIND OF A CAT AND MOUSE GAME.

02:10:01.426 --> 02:10:02.394
FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY SENATE

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:04.129
BILL FIFTY WERE TO PASS AND

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:05.864
MANDATORY UP ZONING BOARD HAPPEN

02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:07.199
AROUND LOCAL DROUGHT TRANSIT

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.634
STOPS YOU STILL SEE LOCAL

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.335
GOVERNMENTS BEEN A BURNING UP

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:12.538
THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO TRY.

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:13.539
TO YOU KNOW AND I CUT OUT YOU

02:10:13.605 --> 02:10:14.806
KNOW HOW GAME THAT --

02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:16.275
THAT UP ZONING SO YOU KNOW TO

02:10:16.341 --> 02:10:17.075
CERTAIN EXTENT I THINK THAT

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:18.110
DYNAMIC IS EVERY HEARD IT WITH

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.778
THE RENO DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAD

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:20.879
EARLIER WHERE YOU HAVE THIS

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:22.648
BEING A PROCESS THAT THE LOCALS

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:23.615
IN THE REGION'S REALLY KND OF

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:28.253
CAME TO ALSO. TO TO AVOID HAVING

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.756
A REALLY COMPLY SO I THINK HOW

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:32.424
LOCALS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:33.458
COMPLIANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:36.195
THERE'S A PROCESS TO ENFORCE --

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:37.596
AND ALSO FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.431
IS OFTEN NEEDED I DO THINK THE

02:10:39.498 --> 02:10:40.666
POINT THAT MISUSE MADE AROUND --

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:41.800
LINKING FUNDING IS REALLY

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:44.536
CRITICAL TO TRY TO GET LOCALS --

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:46.471
TO TO REALLY STEP UP BUT IN I

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:47.539
WOULD SAY YOU COULD LINK GAS TAX

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:49.041
FUNDS OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:50.475
TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AS ONE

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:52.578
METHOD AND SIMPLY HAVING MORE --

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:54.213
YOU GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:55.347
GOVERNMENTS.

02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:56.248
YOU KNOW I WANT ONE COMMENT I

02:10:56.315 --> 02:10:57.449
HEARD ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.218
HEIR OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A CHEAP

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:00.986
DATE IF YOU DANGLE SOME GRANT

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:01.820
MONEY FROM WILL COME ABOUT YOU

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:02.854
KNOW HOW COMPETE EACH OTHER TO

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:04.423
TRY TO GET THOSE FUNDS SO.

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:06.658
THAT CERTAINLY IS ANOTHER OPTION

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:07.759
TO TRY TO GET THAT GET SOME

02:11:07.826 --> 02:11:09.061
TRACTION BUT YOU KNOW IF THE A

02:11:09.127 --> 02:11:10.762
LOT OF THE MANDATES REQUIRE A

02:11:10.829 --> 02:11:13.098
LOT OF STAFF TIME FOR LOCALS

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:14.132
THAN THERE ARE BITS CAN BE MUCH

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:14.766
HARDER FOR THEM TO COMPLY SO I

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:16.969
THINK SIMPLY REMOVING BARRIERS.

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:18.937
REMOVING DISCRETION SO THAT THEY

02:11:19.004 --> 02:11:20.172
DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SEE WHAT

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.406
PROCESS SEES ON NEW LOCAL

02:11:21.473 --> 02:11:23.408
PROCEDURES ARE DEDICATE A LOT OF

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:24.710
STAFF TIME TO IT NOW THEY HAVE

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:25.711
THE POLITICAL COVER TO TELL

02:11:25.777 --> 02:11:26.845
THEIR CONSTITUENTS I'M SORRY THE

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:28.013
STATE'S DOING THIS TO US.

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.748
I THINK THOSE TEND TO BE THE

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:34.586
MOST SUCCESSFUL PASS FORWARD.

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:37.055

STATEWIDE SO THE FIVE HUNDRED

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:40.058
THOUSAND UNITS.

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:42.027
COULD BECOME GET TEN YEARS TO

02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:43.629
GET LEGITIMATE BUT A THEY WOULD

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:46.498
ALSO GET IMMEDIATE RE THEIR

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:48.533
NECKS ON THE NEXT BATCH SO THAT

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:53.005

THANK YOU SO MUCH ON DUTY

02:11:58.443 --> 02:11:58.910
QUICKTIME CHECK WITH THE

02:11:58.977 --> 02:11:59.511
COMMITTEE WERE A FEW MINUTES

02:11:59.578 --> 02:12:00.846
BEFORE FOR AND WE WANT TO MAKE

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.714
SURE WITH THE PLENTY TIME ALSO

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:03.415
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE MISS

02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:05.617
CABALLERO WHO WILL BE SPEAKING

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:06.251
HERE.

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:08.253
IT'S MORE LIKE A YOU COULD.

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.154
WRITE THE TURNOVER CYNICAL

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:12.924
BUREAU THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

02:12:12.991 --> 02:12:14.559
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS --

02:12:14.626 --> 02:12:16.528
THIS PANEL ME JUST JUST SAY THAT --

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:17.162
I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:18.730
INCENTIVES I NEVER CONSIDERED

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:21.466
MYSELF WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:22.467
GOVERNMENT A CHEAP DATE.

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:24.069
WHATEVER IT TAKES --

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:25.237
BUT LET ME LET ME TELL YOU WHAT

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:27.072
I THINK IS IS THE TENSION THAT I

02:12:27.139 --> 02:12:29.875
FEEL IN TERMS OF THE DISTRICT

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.043
THAT I REPRESENT --

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:33.145
I'VE I'VE REPRESENTED SALINAS

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:35.180
BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:37.149
NOW IT THAT BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:38.784
AND NOW WITH AT THE SENATE BUT I

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:40.619
ALSO INCLUDE A LARGE PORTION OF

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:41.887
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT'S THE

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.355
CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION IT'S

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:44.089
ACCEPTING.

02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:46.692
A LOT OF THE REFUGEES FROM THE

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:48.260
BAY AREA THAT ARE LOOKING FOR

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:49.795
THESE BIGGER BIGGER HOMES AND I

02:12:49.861 --> 02:12:51.530
THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT IN MY

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:53.298
MIND AS WE LOOK.

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:54.933
MOVING FORWARD TO THE KINDS OF

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.302
POLICIES THAT CAN FUNDAMENTALLY

02:12:57.369 --> 02:13:00.539
CHANGE HOW PEOPLE SEE HOUSING --

02:13:00.605 --> 02:13:03.208
IS IS THIS IS A BET THE LACK OF

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.043
A OF A RECOGNITION THAT

02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:07.446
AGRICULTURAL RANGELAND AND OPEN

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:09.648
SPACE PARK LAND HAS.

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:12.217
THE ABILITY TO SEQUESTERED.

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:14.219
GREENHOUSE GASES AND THAT IT

02:13:14.286 --> 02:13:18.623
SHOULD KING ABOUT SO BEFORE WE

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:20.625
GET TO A VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:23.829
KIND OF TAX ON HOW FAR ARE YOU

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:26.365
COMMUTING WHICH HAS THE PERVERSE

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:28.400
IMPACT ON THE POOR PEOPLE

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.935
BECAUSE THOSE WEALTHY ENOUGH

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:31.903
THEY CAN STAY IN THAT COMMUNITY.

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.772
STAY IN THE LIVES THEY ACTUALLY

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.640
WORK CLOSE TO THEIR JOBS THOSE

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.542
THAT CAN AFFORD MOVE FURTHER AND

02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:40.412
FURTHER OUT AND IN SO THAT THE

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:41.980
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS TO TRY

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:43.782
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.917
THE DEVELOPMENT I REALLY ENJOYED

02:13:45.984 --> 02:13:47.819
HEARING WHAT SAN DIEGO IS DOING.

02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:50.021
BECAUSE BECAUSE EUROPE YOU'RE A

02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:51.957
BIG COMMUNITY AND AND EAT AND

02:13:52.023 --> 02:13:53.625
YOU'RE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO SOME

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:54.526
OF THE OTHER.

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:56.061
POOR COMMUNITIES PROJECT THE

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:57.195
ABILITY TO CHANGE IT FOR A BURKE

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:59.798
A BROAD GROUP OF PEOPLE AND SO

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.466
THE SO THE CHALLENGE IS TO

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:03.268
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE

02:14:03.335 --> 02:14:04.736
SOME OF THE SMALLER UNITS.

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:06.905
PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN THESE YOU

02:14:06.972 --> 02:14:08.740
KNOW TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.375
FOOT BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:11.543
LOOKING FOR SPACE THAT THEY

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:13.078
DON'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:15.480
SO THE ABILITY TO MOVE INTO AN

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:16.281
EIGHT HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.616
SQUARE FOOT --

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:20.285
UNIT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I

02:14:20.352 --> 02:14:22.220
PART OF I GUESS PART OF THE

02:14:22.287 --> 02:14:25.157
CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS THAT --

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:29.461
FOR US TO INCENTIVIZE PURCHASING.

02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:34.633
A ELECTRIC VEHICLE. FOR SOMEONE

02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:37.135
WHO WOULD ALREADY BY IT IN IN A

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:38.303
BUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD INSTEAD

02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:38.837
OF INVESTING IN.

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:41.406
TRANSIT TO THE SUBURBS AND TO

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:42.507
RURAL CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:43.608
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE

02:14:43.675 --> 02:14:45.243
CONNECTED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.912
CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:48.313
TO BE GIVEN A VOUCHER. TO BE

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.047
ABLE TO TAKE PUBLIC

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:51.283
TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR JOB

02:14:51.349 --> 02:14:52.918
SIXTY MILES AWAY SO WE'VE GOT TO

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:56.855
FIGURE OUT HOW WE REORGANIZED --

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:58.290
THAT THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING

02:14:58.356 --> 02:14:58.990
BUSINESS IN A AND AND AS A

02:14:59.057 --> 02:15:02.093
SNAPSHOT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:04.029
I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE I HAD

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.363
TO COMMUNITIES.

02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:11.002
IN MY DISTRICT AT TOWN HALL

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:11.703
MEETINGS PEOPLE WERE TALKING

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:13.138
ABOUT -- A

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:15.073
INITIATIVE TO STOP GROWTH AND

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.075
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC IT'S

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:18.243
NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:19.711
GROW IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:20.946
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY THAT

02:15:21.012 --> 02:15:22.113
THERE'S THIS NECESSITY OR THEY

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.448
WANT DON'T WANT OUT HOUSES.

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.516
IT'S BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC HAS

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.852
BECOME SO BAD AND WE WILL NEVER

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:29.387
GET RESOURCES FOR THOSE THAT

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:30.889
TRAFFIC CONGESTION BECAUSE

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:32.591
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IT'S

02:15:32.657 --> 02:15:33.158
RURAL.

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:35.026
AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:36.528
PART OF THE TENSION IN TERMS OF

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:37.662
THE INCENTIVES ASFAR AS I'M

02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:39.197
CONCERNED IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:40.665
GOING TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:15:40.732 --> 02:15:41.533
SAY YES WE WERE.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.868
IT AND ALL OF THOSE COUNCIL

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.636
MEMBERS BY THE WAY ARE KIND OF

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:46.571
APPALLED AT THIS GRASSROOTS

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:48.540
MOVEMENT BUT UNTIL WE CAN SHOW

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:49.774
THEM THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:50.442
TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:51.576
TRAFFIC ISSUES ARE NOT GOING TO

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.078
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD SO --

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:54.412
I DON'T THERE'S NOT A QUESTION

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:56.414
THERE BUT I JUST THINK THAT AS

02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:57.549
WE START TALKING ABOUT.

02:15:57.616 --> 02:15:59.918
HOW DO WE REDUCE GREENHOUSE

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:02.287
GASES IT CAN'T JUST BE --

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:03.522
THAT THAT WERE BUYING ELECTRIC

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:05.257
VEHICLES IT WE ALSO HAVE TO

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:06.725
INCLUDE HOW DO WE INCLUDE THE

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:10.795
SUBURBS AND AND THE AND THE

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:12.564
RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL.

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:14.332
THANK YOU SO MUCH HIGHER.

02:16:14.399 --> 02:16:15.934

WITH AS I MENTIONED MY

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:18.069
PRESENTATION LECTURE VEHICLES

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:18.970
ALONE ARE GOING TO GET US THERE

02:16:19.037 --> 02:16:19.638
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO LOOK INTO

02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:20.105
THOSE.

02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:21.072
CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFITS

02:16:21.139 --> 02:16:22.440
AND JUST RAISE A LOT OF GREAT

02:16:22.507 --> 02:16:23.942
POINTS BUT JUST ON THAT THE MTV

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:26.211
QUESTION IF THOSE DOLLARS ON A

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:27.379
EVAN THERE'S A V. M. T. V. WHICH

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:28.647
EVENTUALLY WE NEED TO MOVE TO

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:29.915
WHERE TO FIND TRANSIT.

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:31.149
BIBLE TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR THOSE

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.851
PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:34.653
OUR EDGE COMMUNITIES I THINK

02:16:34.719 --> 02:16:35.420
THAT WOULD PROVIDE A REAL

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:36.821
ECONOMIC AND QUALITY OF LIFE

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:39.391
BENEFIT FOR THEM. TO GET TO WORK

THEY'RE TRAVELING AT LEAST SIXTY

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.108
MILES INTO AND THAT TAKES A

02:16:57.175 --> 02:17:00.845
COUPLE OF HOURS.

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:03.114

FROM OUR CITY MANAGER ONE IS

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:12.384
THAT HOUSING DOESN'T PAY FOR

02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:13.218
ITSELF.

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:14.786
THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.621
THAT HOUSING PAYS FOR THE

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:18.623

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:20.225
THAT CITIES PROVIDE.

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.360
NEVADO IS A POOR PROPERTY TAX

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:25.597
CITY WE GET FIVE CENTS ON EACH

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:28.433

PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES BASED

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:43.148
ON THE FIVE CENTS PER DOLLAR.

02:18:43.214 --> 02:18:47.152
THE STATE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:49.854
A SEVERITY FOR THOSE CITIES THAT

02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:52.424
WERE FORMED AFTER --

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.758
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HAD A LOW

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:56.094
MIL RATE WHEN ALL THE PROPERTY

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:58.196

02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:01.066
STATE NEEDS TO HELP YOU SOLVE

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.667
THAT PROBLEM SO THAT WE CAN

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:04.636
PROVIDE THE SERVICES ONE THING

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:06.271
WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WE HAD

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:07.806
HAMILTON BASE CLOSURE.

02:19:07.872 --> 02:19:09.708
SO WE WERE ABLE TO WITH

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:13.545
REDEVELOPMENT WE USED A 100%.

02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:14.479
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WE USE A

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:15.346
100% OF THE MONEY FROM

02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:18.483

ALSO ABLE TO SET ASIDE A FUND.

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.926

02:19:29.728 --> 02:19:32.163

02:23:52.423 --> 02:23:54.158
THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE HAD

02:23:54.225 --> 02:23:56.894
