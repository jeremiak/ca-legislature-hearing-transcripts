YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:23.970
RECOMMEND NOT MAKING ANY

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.304
CHANGES TO THE EXISTING

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.472
CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAM AT

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.040
THIS TIME. AND THAT MEANS ARE

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.141
NOT APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.743

AMOUNT OF CREDITS THE PROGRAM

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.512
CAN WORD AND NOT APPROVING THE

PROPOSAL TO ALLOW GO BIZ TO

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.050
MILLION DOLLARS TO APPLICANTS

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:40.953
THE PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT PAY

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.221
TAXES THE BUSINESS ENTITY LEVEL.

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.589
WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO BE

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:45.124
DELIVERED OF AND NOT TO RUSH

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.792
INTO PROVIDING LARGE GRANTS TO

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.827
BUSINESSES AS PART OF.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.695
RELOCATION INCENTIVE DEALS UP

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:50.930
UNTIL NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.231
STATED IT'S CALIFORNIA COMPETES

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:53.933
PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE. AND

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.067
GRANTS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.636
SHIFT IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.304
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. AND

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.373
MOREOVER WOULD EXPOSE THE STATE

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:01.207
TO LOSSES OF THESE COMPANIES GO

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.808
OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THAT'S NOT

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.510
IDLE SPECULATION PROGRAM DATA

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.078
FROM GO BEEN SHOWS THAT ONE

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.313
THIRD OF THE CREDITS AWARDED

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.281
DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF THE

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:09.916
PROGRAM AND- CAPTURED. BECAUSE

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.350
THOSE COMPANIES DID NOT ACHIEVE

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.718
THE HIRING INVESTMENT TARGETS

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.020
THAT THEY COMMITTED TO. IT

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.554
WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO BETTER

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.023
UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE AGREEMENTS

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.457
DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND WHETHER

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:19.959
CHANGES THE CHANGES MADE TO THE

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.360
PROGRAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.330
DRESS THIS ISSUES BEFORE

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.064
EXPANDING CALIFORNIA COMPETES.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.199
THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM AS A

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:28.567
MISTER WHITE MENTIONED. IS TO

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.002
RETAIN OR ATTRACT BUSINESSES IN

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.937
CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT NOT

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.838
OTHERWISE LOCATE HERE. WITHOUT

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.740
A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. AND WE

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.175
UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.209
HAS AN INTEREST IN HELPING

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.611
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:39.612
AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC THIS

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.181
YEAR. SO TO THAT END YOU COULD

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.516
CONSIDER REDIRECTING THE FUNDS

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:44.116
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.085
EXPAND THIS PROGRAM. TO ANOTHER

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.219
PROGRAM THAT MIGHT BETTER ALIGN

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.788
WITH YOUR PRIORITIES SUCH AS

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:49.655
THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.257
PROGRAM. WHICH IS NOT ON THE

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.692

LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:01.067
VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.402
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:08.174
SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.211

AREA IN INLAND SOUTHERN

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.514
CALIFORNIA. AND WE TEND TO BE

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.051
THE- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT-

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.219
HOUSING AREA FOR THE JOBS THAT

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.121
ARE LOCATED IN OTHER AREAS OF

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.456
THE STATE THAT WHERE I COME

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.558
FROM MOSTLY THE URBAN COASTAL

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.660
AREAS. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:29.829
ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.365
THE OTHERS TO AT LEAST CONSIDER

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.867
AT SOME POINT PROBABLY NOT THIS

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.035
YEAR DUE TO TIMING BUT AT SOME

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.504
POINT IS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:40.639
OUR JOB INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.743
OUR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. RULES

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.112
REGULATIONS. INCENTIVES AND

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:49.015
ASPIRATIONS HERE WE TEND TO

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.383
INCENTIVIZE JOB CREATION AND

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.851
EXPANSION IN AREAS OF THE STATE

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.552
INCLUDING AS I SAID THE COASTAL

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:56.055
URBAN AREAS. IS THAT ARE OFTEN

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.357
SHORT OF HOUSING. AND I THINK

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.693
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS DEVELOP A

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.862
CLOSER LINK OR CORRELATION

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.865
BETWEEN JOB INCENTIVES AND

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.000
GUARANTEES THAT SUFFICIENT

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.368
HOUSING TO HOUSE THE NEW

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.403
EMPLOYEES THAT WE'RE

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:13.406
INCENTIVIZING. IN THOSE AREAS

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.141
EXIST IN THOSE AREAS OR AT

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.942
LEAST A GUARANTEE THAT

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.244
SUFFICIENT HOUSING WILL BE

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.913
CONSTRUCTED- TIED TO THE

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.415
ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THAT WE'RE

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:25.818
PROVIDING TO EITHER EXPAND JOBS

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.320

SPEND IN THE THIRTY FIRST ST

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.278

THAT SHOULD BE NOTED AND THAT

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.648

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:58.817
BE COMMENDED. I JUST WANTED TO

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:00.052
TRY TO POINT OUT WHAT I

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.420
PERCEIVE TO BE THE DISCONNECT

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:03.355

THE JOBS ARE INCENTIVIZED IN

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.925
THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS BUT

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.127
THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPT WE'RE

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.995
SHOVING STATE MONEY DOWN TO

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.131
INCENTIVIZE OTHER JOB EXPANSION

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.031
IN EXISTING PLANTS OR

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.134
RECRUITING. NEW BUSINESSES TO

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.935
BRING NEW PLANTS TO THOSE AREAS

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.771
BUT WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY OF THE

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:20.272
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CERTIFY

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.940
THAT THEY HAVE THE HOUSING TO

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:24.676
HOUSE THOSE WORKERS. AND WE SO

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:28.580
THEY EXPAND AND THEN THERE'S

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:29.214
ARENA A HOUSING ALLOWANCE. THE

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.616
HOUSING IS AN ALLOCATED THEY

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:31.717
DON'T HAVE A HOUSING OR THEY

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:32.885
DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.486
THEN ANOTHER ARM OF THE STATE

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.921
SINCE THE THREATENING LETTER.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.656
AND TRIES TO SUE TO ENFORCE

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.391

WE PUT THE TWO TOGETHER. WE

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:41.860
COULD PROBABLY HAVE A

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.696

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.739
HOUSE OF WORKERS CLOSE TO WHERE

EMPLOYED SINGLE UNDER

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.853
ENTREPRENEURS THAT. HAVE LOST

ALL THEIR CAPITAL IN THE

DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AND

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:39.791
THERE'S GOING TO BE A REAL NEED

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:42.794
TO CREATE CREATE FOR A FUND SO

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:44.629
THAT THEY CAN START BACK UP

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.532
AND- REALLY TO CAPITALIZE WHAT

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.601
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND- I'M NOT

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.237
SURE THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:53.471
FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AS MUCH

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:55.573
AS A NEED FOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MAY NOT NEED TO BE SPENT BUT I

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.919
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:10.255
ACCOUNTABILITY THE LEAD TO THE

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.524
LEGISLATURE AND- AND I LOOK

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.559
FORWARD TO HAVING A DISCUSSION

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:17.662
ON ON HOW WE CAN CREATE THE

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:20.365
LANGUAGE SO THAT- THE RESOURCES

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:23.468
CAN BE USED IN A WAY THAT IS-

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.904
BENEFICIAL AND I. THAT THE MORE

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.105
THAT WE CAN PUSH MONEY TO THE

BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:30.708
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE ON

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:31.843
THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.178
UNDERSTAND WITH THE NEEDS OF

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.413
THE MICRO BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.248
AND FOR MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.284
CAESAR. BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.152
STARTED BY BY IMMIGRANTS WHO

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.154

STARTING A BUSINESS ARE ARE

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.427
PRETTY COMPLICATED SO THEY

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.529
START SMALL AND THEY AND THEY

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.864
BUILD FROM THAT AND I WANT TO

pSUPPORTIVE OF ATTEMPTS TO-

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.806
LEVERAGES FEDERAL FUNDING THIS

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.574

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:23.745
CATEGORY WE DO HAVE- IF YOU

WERE ALL AROUND UNCERTAINTY AT

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.586
THE FEDERAL AND- FOR ONE THIS

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:34.623

WHEN IT WAS MADE BY THE

PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN DC

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.968
WE IT ISN'T CLEAR YET WHETHER

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.803
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.605

THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:56.178
DIFFERENTLY SO. WE THINK IT'S

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.379
IT MAY BE WORTH HOLDING OFF

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.014
UNTIL YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.983
HOW THE NEW ADMINISTRATION

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:03.418

TO HANDLE THE SALT DEDUCTION

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.869
DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY IT'S

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:23.705
HANDLED UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:24.339

SOME TIME TO DECIDE EXACTLY HOW
