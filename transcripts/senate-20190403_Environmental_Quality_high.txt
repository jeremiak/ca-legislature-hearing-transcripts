AT HEALTH CENTER HELD SOME OF OUR VERY MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN WITH THE DEFINITION OF THIS ADVANCED COMMUNITY SINCE IT POINTS TO A STATEWIDE INSTEAD OF AN AVERAGE. AREA -- IN THE AREA I INCOME AVERAGING WHAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT. WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION IN NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE IN AS THIS ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SB FORTY FIVE IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND OTHER WE'VE STILL GOT A WAYS TO GO TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS. HI BUT ULTIMATELY IF THIS BILL IS IS PASS AND THEN HOUSE NOT BY-THE VOTERS. SB FORTY FIVE WILL FIND ON THE GROUND PROJECTS DESIGNED TO HELP US PREPARE FOR THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS ANOTHER IMPACTS THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE SEVERE WILDFIRES. PRIMARILY -- BUT ALSO CATASTROPHIC FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES. A PROLONGED DROUGHTS EXTREME HEAT AND MORE. NO REPORT THAT WAS PRESENTED TO NOT TO RESOURCES COMMITTEE LAST WEEK SOME OF YOU WERE THERE. THE LA -- ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL COSTS OF THESE IMPACTS IN THE ORDER OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO THE STATE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY IN A NOTED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR RISK TO PRIVATE. TO PROPERTY VALUE RESULTING FROM MODEST SEALEVEL RISE ALONE. DURING INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE NEW ABNORMAL I IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS ROBERT FENTON THE REGION NINE ADMINISTRATOR FOR FEMA. SAID THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT FIRES OR MITIGATE THEIR SEVERITY WE CAN SAVE SIX DOLLARS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS BILL THIS BOND AS EXACTLY THAT BY SETTING A COURSE TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES. BY INVESTING IN NECESSARY MEASURES TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IN OUR VITAL NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE DEDICATES FUNDING TO PROJECTS. THAT WILL REDUCE PIRACY YOUR COMMUNITIES AND INSURE OUR FORESTS ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND MORE INTENSE. WILDFIRES REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FLOOD EVENTS BY SLOWING RUNOFF. IMPROVING BROWN WATER INFILTRATION PROTECT COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM SEA LEVEL RISE HELP URBAN COMMUNITIES ADOPTED THE RISING TEMPERATURES. I REDUCING HEAT ISLAND EFFECT YOUR GREETING PROJECTS IN CAPTURING STORM WATER. TO STABILIZE DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES IT'S OUR VERY STRONG FEELING THAT WE MUST. TAKE AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT THAT WE KNOW THAT ARE COMING THIS IS ONE STEP IN THAT EFFORT AND I HAVE WITH ME. TODAY I LEAN TO ADD. WHO IS THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK? DISTRICTS FIRE CHIEF. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT I'M BUT WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS WHO MAY BE COMING AS WELL BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER WITH THE COMMISSION TO THE FIRE CHIEF. YEAH MORNING. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PARK DISTRICT WAS FOUNDED IN -- NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR IT'S THE LARGEST LOCAL PARK AGENCY IN THE NATION. SERVES OVER TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN -- ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND WE ENJOY A TWENTY FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR [inaudible] I'M. THE EAST PARK DISTRICTS FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE CATASTROPHIC NINETEEN NINETY ONE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. I AM THE NINETY ONE FIRE WAS A CALL TO FOCUSED ON RESILIENT FIRE PROTECTION. AS A MORAL MANDATE. AT THE TIME IT TOOK A TWENTY SIX LIVES IT BURNED OVER THREE THOUSAND HOMES AND THAT'S ONLY THREE THOUSAND HOMES COMPARED TO THE FIRES THAT WE HAVE NOW. I'M A COST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. A TO RECOVER FROM AND THAT WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. SO IS A LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY THE PARK DISTRICT IS KEENLY AWARE. UNDERSTANDING OF THE NECESSARY BALANCE BETWEEN STEWARDSHIP AND FORCE MANAGEMENT. THEY KIND OF CREATES A RESILIENCY. AND THE DISTRICT UNDERSTANDS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO SAFE AND HEALTHY FORESTS SO WE SPEND. ONE MILLION APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN FORCE MANAGEMENT. AND THAT IS FAR FAR LESS THAN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IT COST RECOVER FROM THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. IN A TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE WENT TO THE VOTERS -- FOR THEM TO APPROVE A TWENTY TEN WHILE FIRE HAZARD REDUCTION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THAT IN IT'S BEEN GIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE WE STARTED THAT. TWENTY TEN IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO GET THE ENVIRONMENT A CLEARANCE TO DO THAT WORK. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AND DEMAND WILL INCREASE M. AND ACCELERATE AS THE CLIMB IT CONTINUE TO CHANGE IN THE NEED IS REALLY URGENT. A BOND INFUSION OF THIS KIND WOULD ACCELERATE THE WORK AND LEVERAGE DIGITAL RESOURCES FROM FEMA HELLFIRE. I KNOW YES WE'RE REALLY AT THIS POINT IN A RACE. AGAINST A CATASTROPHIC FIRES AS THEY RELEASE MORE AND MORE CARBON. INTO THE AIR EXACERBATING THE PACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND INCREASING HEALTH IMPACTS -- TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS AN ANNUAL BAD AIR QUALITY DAYS INCREASE THE ANNUAL BAD AIR. AIR QUALITY DAYS INCREASE AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT DURING THE CAMPFIRE LAST YEAR. AS THE TWO COUNTIES WHICH WE SERVE ALONG WITH ALL THE THE REST COUNTIES -- IN THE EAST BAY EXPERIENCE THE WORST AIR ON THE PLANET FOR THIRTEEN DAYS -- EVEN WORSE THAN BEIJING. AND THAT'S EXAMPLE OF THAT CATASTROPHIC. AND RELEASE OF CARBON INTO THE AIR IS AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPFIRE. SO THIS BOND WE SEE AS A FIRST RESPONDER TOOL -- TO AN URGENT ACCELERATING READ THAT WILL REQUIRE MANY TOOLS THE TOOLBOX. BUT THE TIME FOR THAT TOOL IS REALLY NOW. pNEEDS -- REQUIRE FINANCIAL RESOURCES RECALL. COMMITMENT AND SENATOR ALLEN'S BOND MEASURE REALLY STARTS A CONVERSATION. THANK YOU.

ROBUST PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THE VOUCHER FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DOESN'T. MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME FOLKS LIKE AN E. BIKE FOR BIKE SHARING WOULD SO. YOU'LL JUST PARKING BACK TO MY OWN DISTRICT. WHERE WE HAVE SOME OF LIMITED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THIS EXPANDS? IT DRAMATICALLY I HOPE EXPANDS OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME DISPENSE. SO IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT TARGETING I THINK THAT THAT. IN ADDITION TO ITS ARE YOUR IS NOT REALLY ANSWER BY PUBLIC TRANSIT BUT NOT SUPER LONG COMMUTE SIDE RIGHT LIKE RIGHT SEMI -- BY YOU'RE NOT GONNA COMMUTE FROM FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO. ON A BIKE -- BUT YOU ARE GOING TO YOU CAN AND AND FOLKS DO COMMUTE YOU KNOW TEN MILES ON THE BIKE HOUSE THE BIKE SHARE PART WORK LIKE THAT'S THE OTHER THING IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS SO.

I BELIEVE SO. OKAY. THANKS I'M OF THE BILL. I'M REALLY SHE TO WORK ON THAT SIR. THANK YOU CENTER -- THAT OTHER QUESTION SPOTS FROM ME. OKAY SO THE ITEM HAS BEEN MOVED AS CENTER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. BUT WE ARE GINGIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US YEAH ABSOLUTELY. ITEM MOVE BY SOME STERN. AS EXCERPTED CORAL. ITEM NUMBER TEN SP FOUR HUNDRED THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE. SENATE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES YEAH [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN [inaudible] I STONE. I CAN LIVE MY CASKEY I OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIRTY CENTER. OKAY I I C. S. AT A COUPLE EURO -- IS HERE. AND SHE ACTUALLY HAS TWO BILLS ON OUR DOCKET TODAY THE FIRST ONE SO PRESENT IS ITEM SIX IN YOUR PACKETS MEMBERS THAT'S SB. THREE SEVENTEEN RELATING TO WASTE FACILITIES AND PROHIBIT CHEMICALS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. THREE SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD BAN THE SALE OF CERTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS USED IN RV WASTE WATER TANKS WHICH CAN CAUSE GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION. MANY RECREATIONAL VEHICLE OWNERS USE CHEMICAL DEODORANTS TO REDUCE THE ORDERS FROM THE BLACK WATER IN GRAY ROCK WATER TANKS IN THERE. ARE VIS. THESE DEODORANTS CONTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE WHICH REDUCE ORDERS BY KILLING THE BACTERIA THAT LIVE IN THE TANKS AND PRODUCE THE ORDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHEN ARE THE OWNERS TOOK UP THEIR TANKS IN RV PARKS IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE? INTO A SEPTIC TANK THE DEPOSIT THE CONTENTS OF THEIR TANKS INCLUDING THESE TALK TOXIC CHEMICALS. ONCE IN THE PARK'S SEPTIC TANK THESE CHEMICALS KILL THE BACTERIA NEEDED TO TREAT THE PARKS WASTE MOST OF THESE RV PARKS REQUEST HAVE A SYSTEM. THAT USES -- THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WASTE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE. TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THIS CAN CAUSE A SEPTIC TANKS TO FAIL WHICH THEN REQUIRES THE RV OWNERS TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FAIL SYSTEM INCREASES THE RISK THAT UNTREATED WASTE INCLUDING THE TOXIC CHEMICALS. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE WILL MAKE ITS WAKE WAY INTO THE GROUNDWATER WHICH THREATENS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PARK VISITORS THE OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS NEIGHBORS IN THESE MOSTLY RURAL COMMUNITIES. IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE GROUND WATER ENCOURAGE THE USE OF SAFE ALTERNATIVES SB THREE SEVENTEEN BANS THE SALE AND USE OF CERTAIN TOXIC CHEMICALS. AS WELL AS REQUIRES THE RV'S TO IN THE RV OWNERS TO INFORM THE CUSTOMERS OF THE BAND THE BAND. WITH THE SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A SOLUTION FORMED WITH INPUT FROM THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AN RV. PARK PARK OWNERS TO PREVENT GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION WE HAD AN INSTANCE. RECENTLY WHERE THERE WAS FROM ALDEHYDE APPEARED IN -- GROUND WATER SYSTEM AND SO THIS REALLY ELEVATED THE ISSUE. OF CONCERN IN -- IN IN WHEN I'M AND ONE OF THE RB IN MY DISTRICT. BY RESTRICTING THE WITHIN THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE THE MAKERS OF THE FORMALDEHYDE IN THESE CHEMICALS ALSO HAS A NON. TOXIC ALL THAT THEY SELL -- AND SO IT IT'S VERY EASY TO SHIFT OVER TO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WILL NOT CONTAMINATE THE GROUNDWATER AMONG -- BECAUSE THE THE SYSTEM TO FAIL. BY RESTRICTING THESE PROJECTS NOT ONLY IS GROUNDWATER PROTECTED BUT THE WORRY AND BURDEN OF SMALL OWNERS. AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES RELIEF. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. YOU CENTER YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JASON OCCURRED WITH METAL STING GILBERT ROPES AND SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RV PARKS AND CAMPGROUNDS. BRIEFLY WHERE PRIVATELY OWNED RV PARKS AND CAMPGROUNDS ACROSS THE STATE WE REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR CAFIERO BEING WILLING TO AUTHOR SB THREE SEVENTEEN AND REALLY IT'S A SHE SAID THE COMBINATION OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF GOOD WORK ON HER PART. TO RESOLVE A DECADES LONG ISSUE THAT'S BEEN PLAGUING THE RV PARK AND CAMPGROUND INDUSTRY. I'M GONNA TRY TO BE REALLY BRIEF BECAUSE THE SENATOR WAS QUITE ARTICULATE AND THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN AND OBVIOUSLY RECOMMEND A SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL -- RIGHT NOW TODAY A AND R. V. OWNER NOT AN RV PARK OWNER AND ARMY OWNER CAN PURCHASE CHEMICALS THAT AS THE SENATOR SAID ARE TOXIC CARCINOGENS. AND USE THEM AND THEY END UP AND MY CLIENTS PARK MEMBERS. SEPTIC SYSTEMS WHEN THAT HAPPENS NOT ONLY ARE THE AT RISK OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION IS A SENATOR SAID BUT THEY ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE END OF LIFE OF THESE PRODUCTS. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM ESPECIALLY AS THE SENATOR SAID. SINCE THERE ARE MANY GREEN ALTERNATIVES SO WITH THAT I WILL I WILL CONCLUDE IN JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT AND VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT -- QUESTIONS ARE WELL AS ART BOOKS ONE IN VOICE SUPPORT. MELISSA ONE OR THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION APOLOGIES WOULDN'T GET A LETTER IN TIME BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER -- VOICE SUPPORT OF OPPOSITION AND CONCERNS ANYONE MAKE MY COMMENTS. OKAY GUIDANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ETCETERA CASKEY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT TALKS ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN RATHER PROTECTIVE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM FOR SAFE CONSUMER ITEMS AND ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IT'S WELL IT'S READILY AVAILABLE IT'S NOT THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT. CONSUMERS WILL READILY HAVE IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND THEREFORE IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO TO LOOK DIRECTLY TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE BAND THAT YOU AGREE WITH THAT ANALYSIS THAT THEY MATCH I DO I'VE BEEN VERY. SUPPORTIVE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL. I I DON'T THINK IT MAKES ANY SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE DOING BANDS WHEN WE HAVE AN ORGANISATION INSTITUTION FRANKLY I SUPPORTED IT WHEN -- WHEN IT WAS CREATED? BUT THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION SO I DO AGREE WITH THAT ANALYSIS THANK YOU. YEAH I KNOW HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STERN. I IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY SO SIGNIFICANT. ITEM NUMBER SIX SB THREE ONE SEVEN THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASSED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. BATES AYE HILL [inaudible] SKINNER. STERN STERN AYE STONE STONE I WAKE HOUSE. SB I OKAY SO WE'LL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS AND ON BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU JASON -- THE SNOW TURN YOUR NEXT BILL. SENATE CAREER THAT'S AS BEFORE FOURTEEN AS ITEM TWELVE IN YOUR POCKETS MEMBERS. SMALL SYSTEM WATER THREE ACTIVE TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN READY FUTURE ON PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR FOURTEEN THE SMALL SYSTEMS WATER THIRTY ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEM STATEWIDE THE CHRONICALLY FAILED TO SERVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE SYSTEMS ARE IDENTIFIED BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION ON THE WATER BOARD HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER WEBSITE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL REVERSE RURAL SYSTEMS SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TOO MANY OF WHICH ARE IN MY DISTRICT. TYPICALLY THE SYSTEMS LIKE THE FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING CONTAMINATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES NECESSARY TO OPERATE A HIGH FUNCTIONING WATER SYSTEM. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IS LONG OVERDUE. ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS TURN ON THE TAP AND CANNOT DRINK THE WATER. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED MANY LAWS TO ADDRESS SOME ELEMENTS OF THE WATER ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE INCLUDING CAPITAL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSOLIDATION WHEN AN ANCHOR TENANT AGENCY IS NEARBY. WE MOVED IN THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE WATER BOARD TO SPEED UP THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO FAILING STATE REGULATED SYSTEMS. ALLOWING FOR RESTRUCTURING OF THE UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE OF FEELING COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS WILL CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY WHEN NEARBY ANCHOR AGENCIES ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR CONSOLIDATION. AND WE'RE ECONOMIC SCALE IS REQUIRED FOR A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. SB FOR FOURTEEN PROPOSES TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE SYSTEMS AGAIN A FIGHT BY THE WATER BOARD BY MERGING SMALL NOT COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS INTO A LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. ACCESS TO STATE BACK CAPITAL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ENHANCED FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND STREAMLINE MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS INCLUDING A LOCALLY ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS A NEW AGENT NEW PUBLIC AGENCY MISS IT HERE TO MANDATED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY LOS CREATING EFFICIENCIES AND COST EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION. SB FOUR FOURTEEN WOULD COMPLEMENT EXISTING WATER BOARD CONSOLIDATION POWER INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED. IT IS A NEW TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND IT'S NOT. EXPECTED TO WORK IN EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE. THE AMENDMENTS I AM TAKING WOULD IN FACT ACCELERATE FUTURE CONSOLIDATIONS AS IT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD TO INITIATE ACTION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER FAILING SYSTEM PLAN IS REJECTED -- NO PLAN IS FILE. THIS MEANS THAT AS BEFORE FOURTEEN WILL FACILITATE THE NOBLE EFFORT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. I REGULATING SAFE DRINKING WATER BY GIVING REAL TEETH TO THE WATER BOARD EFFORT TO CLEAR OUT THESE UNDER PERFORMING WATER SYSTEMS. LAST YEAR MY ASSEMBLY BILL. AT TWENTY FIFTY PASSES COMMITTEE AND SENSE THEN WE WORKED WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS A WATER BOARD ENVIRONMENTAL JUST GROUP AND LAUGH. THE BILL EVEN STRONGER. SENATE BILL FOUR FOURTEEN PROVIDES A CRUCIAL PATH TO PROVIDE A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE DRINKING WATER. WITH ME TODAY TO PRY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OUR DANIEL CO TO THE EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT DANIELLE PLUS SET FROM THIS CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU CHAIR ALLEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB FOUR FOURTEEN TODAY I'M DANIEL CODE EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES WATER WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER TO EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RIGHT RESIDENT IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AS AN ORGANIZATION EASTERN MUNICIPAL HAS DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH CONSOLIDATING RIPARIAN SYSTEMS WITH FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SEVERE CONTAMINATION ISSUES WITH AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. AND EXAMINING THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT OFTEN RESULT IN SYSTEM FAILURE WE FOUND THAT 81% OF THE CHRONICALLY NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE BOARD. SERVE UNDER FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS THESE ULTRA SMALL SYSTEMS STRUGGLE THE FINANCIAL ABILITY AND RATE BASE TO COVER NORMAL OPERATIONS AND BASS OVERHEAD EXPENSES. SO THEN WHEN WATER QUALITY ISSUES OCCUR OR INFRASTRUCTURE FAILS SPREADING ANY EXTRA COST LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS IS SIMPLY NOT LIABLE. WELL THE STATE BOARD HOUSE OF POWER TO CONSOLIDATE SYSTEMS THERE ALREADY IS CONSTRAINED WHEN THERE IS NO. VIABLE RECEIVING AGENCY SB FOR FOURTEEN ADDRESSES THIS BY ALLOWING HONESTLY UNDERPERFORMING SYSTEMS TO BE MERGED. A STEP BY STEP PROCESS THAT INCLUDES THE LINE TIMELINE INTO A MORE ROBUST AND FINANCIALLY VIABLE SYSTEM. THE PROCESS USE IT UTILIZES QUALIFIED APPOINTED ADMINISTRATORS TO FORM A MORE CONFIDENT SUCCESSOR WATER AGENCY -- A LOCALLY MANDATED LASKO PUBLIC PROCESS LASKO WILL CONDITION EACH SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT PRESCRIBED OPERATING AND CAPITAL PLANS. THAT WILL RESULT IN WATER QUALITY COMPLIANCE. AND SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS AND EACH SYSTEM WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PLANS AS THEIR REGULAR MANDATED REPORTING. IS OUTLINED AND TO TO PROGRESS TOWARDS WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE BILL. IN SUMMARY AS BEFORE FOURTEEN PROVIDES A TOOL TO THE STATE BOARD THAT WE BELIEVE ADDRESSES BOTH. IN YOUR TOURING NEAR TERM NEED FOR INTERVENTION. AND THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A VITAL TOOL TO ADDRESS THE SAFE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANIEL WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO BECAUSE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SB FOUR FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE AND OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. I'M SB FOUR FOURTEEN SIX TO BRIDGE AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE STATE'S CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M. THE STATE MUST RELY ON A RECEIVING AGENCY TO MERGE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS CONSISTENTLY FAILING TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE PROCESS IS NOTED BY SENATOR CAFIERO IN SB FOUR FOURTEEN WHAT INSTEAD ALLOW THESE CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS TO MERGE AS ONE FUNCTIONAL MORE ROBUST SYSTEM. IT SETS UP A UNIQUE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS THAT WHILE COMPLIMENTARY DOES NOT MERE OR IMPORTANTLY SUPERSEDE EXISTING AUTHORITIES PARTICULARLY WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS TAKING TODAY. IF THE STATE BOARD FINDS THAT THE CREATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITY IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSES LOCALLY CONTROLLED AND TRANSPARENT. WHICH IS ESSENTIAL THE LONG LASTING GOOD GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE OUR GOVERNANCE WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN AND SHOULD FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL HAS BEEN DRAFTED TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL STEPS. AS NOTED BY OUR CO SPONSOR IN THE AUTHOR THIS IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED THROUGH OTHER MEANS. EVEN WITH THE RECENT EFFORTS BY THE STATE WATER BOARD ON MANDATORY INVOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS USING EXISTING AUTHORITIES. THEY'RE STILL OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SYSTEMS THE WITHOUT THAT -- SERVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SB. FOUR EIGHTEEN WILL NOT DELAY EXISTING CONSOLIDATIONS AND IS NOT MEANT TO REPLACE OTHER AUTHORITIES BUT RATHER COMPLIMENT THEM AND ALLOW THE WATER BOARD SELECT THE OPTION THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE SITUATION. THE TIME IS NOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE SB FOUR FOURTEEN PROVIDES A SUSTAINABLE PATH FORWARD TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND WISH. WE ASK DR. THANK YOU MUCH AND AND NOW AND YOUR CAN'T TAKE IT FROM YOUR SPARKLY PINK SASH THAT IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY HE'S JUST LAYING ON MY BIRTHDAY. IT IS YES AND I WAS GIVEN THIS FROM A LOVELY YOUNG LADY WHO'S SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM THE DAUGHTER OF I'VE MISSED CODES AND SO I FELT COMPELLED TO WHERE IT IS OKAY NO IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC. HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU -- TO YOU GUYS OKAY ALL RIGHT SO -- OKAY YOU WANNA WAIT IN IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MERCED MANNING WE KP PUBLIC FAIRS ON BEHALF OF WESTERN.

SARS LEVERS ON BEHALF OF THE MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARIAN WARMER DOWN WITH REPRESENTING RURAL COUNTIES WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO MEETING OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

GOOD MORNING BATTLE ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA ANA WATERSHED PROJECT THIRTY IN STRONG SUPPORT. NO ONE MEDIC ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF RESTAURANTS PART. THANK YOU OKAY I ANYONE WHO WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL UP POSITION I ARE NEWMAN FROM THE ROAD COMMITTEE ASSISTANCE CORPORATION I'M AND I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING WE APPRECIATE IT SENATORS ATTENTION THE ISSUE. WE WORK WITH A LOT OF THOSE CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. IN ELEVEN WESTERN STATES -- HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. YOU KNOW IN RECENT YEARS WE WORKED ON A LOT OF REGIONALIZATION WE CALL IT REGION'S ATION NOT CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE INSULATION HAS SORT OF THAT. REPUTATION AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IS NOT ALWAYS IDEAL. WE WORKED A LOT OF REGIONALIZATION PRODUCTS OUT THE STATE IN LAKE COUNTY CONTRA COSTA. PLASTER TULARE RIVERSIDE -- AND OTHERS AND YEAH WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF BEING. AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT. IT'S STILL FEEL SIZES TOO HEAVY HANDED IN A TOP DOWN ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WE APPRECIATE THE THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF AMENDMENTS -- UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL CAN'T SUPPORT BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN US THAT EVERY SINGLE PROJECT IS DIFFERENT AND THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE DESERT ON THE COAST -- IN THIS YEAR AS EVER ANY PLACE IN THE STATE HAS UNIQUE NEEDS. AND AND AND WE FAVOR AN APPROACH THAT SUPPORTS RIDGE'S NATION BUT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY AND INCENTIVES FOR THE SO THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN TAILOR THE RESPONSES TO THE LOCAL MEATS AND FOR THAT REASON. WE WERE WE THANK YOU THANK YOU. TV SEEN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I I DO WANNA -- APOLOGIZE THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET A LETTER AND I DID JUST THAT THE TIMING OF THE THE COMMITTEES AND AND WE WEREN'T AWARE THERE'S GONNA BE HEARD TODAY AND APOLOGIES -- ON THAT -- WE ARE I THINK AGAIN SIMILARLY EXTRAORDINARILY GRATEFUL TO THE SENATOR. FOR FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE A SAFE DRINKING WATER I'M AND GOVERNANCE WERE I THINK I SEE THAT THE AMENDMENT -- AT HAVE MOVED US CLOSER -- TO A PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS EQUALLY STILL FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. THAT WE CAN HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH TOO AGAIN MINIMIZE THE COST MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE TO DELAY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE MOST CALIFORNIANS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. YES SIR. JONATHAN NELSON WITH A COMMUNITY WATER CENTER I'M ONE ADELINE MY COMMENTS WITH -- ABC COMMENTS WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE SENATOR I'M AND TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR FOR THE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. I'M IT'S IT WAS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THAT ORIGINALLY PUSHED FOR THE ORIGINAL CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITIES. ALONG WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD OVER THE OPPOSITION OF THE WATER AGENCY COMMUNITY SO I THINK WE'RE ALSO JUST A PREACHER OF HOW. FAR THE CONVERSATION HAS SHIFTED THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS IS JUST A LITTLE MORE CUMBERSOME -- THEN IT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT WE THINK WE CAN GET IT RIGHT BY THE END WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO DO THAT AGAIN APPRECIATE. THE CENTERS ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. AND I'M ANDREA OF INTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE ARE ALSO IN IN A POSE UNLESS AMENDED UPPER -- POSITION AT THIS POINT WE DO THANK THE SENATOR -- AS HAVE OTHERS -- FOR THIS ISSUE WE THINK THE CONCEPT OF CONSOLIDATION IS IMPORTANT BUT AS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW THE BILL STILL IS A LITTLE TOO CUMBERSOME AS YOU HEARD AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE A PRACTICAL SOLUTION. TO DO THINK IT DOES NEED FOR WORK AS IT MOVES SO IT THANK YOU CAN I JUST ASK YOU WHAT WHEN YOU SAY CUMBERSOME WHAT WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS. SURE ENOUGH THERE'S A THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT O I MEAN THERE'S INITIALLY THERE'S CERTAIN FINDINGS. THAT THE STATE BOARD WILL HAVE TO TO MAKE PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION. THAT -- CURRENTLY CAN AREN'T IN PLACE SO THAT WERE A BIT CONCERNED. THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME PROCESS AHEAD OF SORT OF MOVING FORWARD ANY SUCH. KIND OF ANY OF THAT KIND OF IDENTIFIED AREAS IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS AND WANT TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS -- THE OTHER ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AND WAS TAKEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WHERE THERE'S A PROPOSED PLANNING GOES TO LAUGH GO IT AND CAN COME. BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATOR GOES BACK TO LEFT GO THAT GOES TO THE BOARD THERE'S A AND IT THEY CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS THERE'S AN APPEALS PROCESS. ALL THIS CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS AND IN THE MEANTIME THE COMMUNITIES AT ISSUE DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER -- AT THE AT THE END OF THE AT THE END OF THE PROCESS THAT YOU CAN GO BACK AND FORTH THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND STILL THAT CAN ADMINISTRATOR CAN DECIDE THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY FEASIBLE OR IN IN INCOME WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE. ONE SO I THINK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE REDUCING AS MUCH OF THAT BACK AND FORTH AS POSSIBLE. MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY CAM AT THE OUTSET WHAT THE BEST STRATEGY IS. TO CAN KIND OF MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY TOWARDS THAT END. TOTALLY GET THE YOU DON'T THINK IT. THIS FAST ENOUGH BUT I BUT SURELY. INTO AN CORRECT IF I'M WRONG BUT BUT THIS IS BE BETTER THAN WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. THANK YOU KNOW AND I WOULD. WOULDN'T MIND CAN KICKING THINGS OVER. TO MY COLLEAGUE ARI AYE AYE THAT WE ACTUALLY. THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TOOLS CURRENTLY THERE'S A GOOD SB A CONSOLIDATION LAST YEAR AB -- TWENTY FIVE ON GOING TO EXPAND AND IMPROVED UPON THAT THERE ARE -- SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MANAGERIAL CONSOLIDATION ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES AREN'T -- CONTINUOUS AND WHAT I THINK THIS THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE IS ANOTHER TOOL ALSO COMPLEMENTING THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATOR THOR EDDIE. I THINK TO BE TO BE HONEST I THINK WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SPECIFIC GAP. THIS IS FILLING IS AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE FRAMEWORK. RATHER THAN -- RATHER THAN RE CREATING THE FRAMEWORK. DO YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION LETTER AND CENTER SAYS. SEEMS TO THINK THAT THIS BILL. ASSUMES THAT. D. WE ARE RESULT FOR IS ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS AND I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT MY READING OF THE BILL BUT YOU. DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. THAT THEY RAISE THE STATE YOUR BILL YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST. IT'S ALL THAT AT ALL COSTS. NO MATTER WHAT. WELL I I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S -- WAS FALLACIOUS ABOUT THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS AN OPTION IT'S A TOOL. THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN DECIDE IF THIS IS NOT THE BEST TOOL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET COMPLIANCE THESE WATER SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS FOREVER. AND WE PASSED RULES ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CONSOLIDATE. AND IT HASN'T HELPED THEM I I WAS GOING TO BRING THE WATER BOTTLE SO YOU COULD SEE WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE TAP BECAUSE IT'S URGENT. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S [inaudible] WHAT? KIND OF BLOWS MY MIND ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT. IS THAT ANY TIME YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LAUGH CO PROCESS. IT'S IT'S BURDENSOME BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE VESTED IN LASKO THE AUTHORITY TO TO DO THINGS THAT NO OTHER. YEAH ON A REGIONAL BASIS THAT NO OTHER GOVERNMENT CAN DO SO THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO HAVE TO BE PUBLIC HEARINGS HAVE TO BE NOTICED. PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE COMMENTS ON WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND I WISH WE COULD JUST DO AWAY WITH IT MAYBE IT'S A IT'S JUST A TOOL TO SEE IF WE CAN GET OURSELVES THERE IN PART OF THE PROBLEM IS IN MANY OF THESE. COMMUNITIES THEY'RE ISOLATED THEY'RE NOT NEXT TO A BIG SYSTEM AND SO THERE'S NOT A BIG SYSTEM YOU CAN POINT TO TO SAY WE NEED FOR YOU TO COME IN AND AND HELP MAKE THIS. WATER SYSTEM COMPLIANCE IF THEY'RE SO WHAT THAT THE CONCEPT IS IT IS THAT YOU GET A NUMBER OF NON COMPLIANT SYSTEMS AND TRY TO BUILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THEM UP AND UP AND MAKE IT WORK. FOR ALL OF THEM RATHER THAN JUST WAITING AROUND TO FIND A SYSTEM THAT. THAT THAT THAT WANTS TO ADOPT A MINUTE IT THIS WAY. AT THIS RATE WE WON'T WE WON'T GET CLEAN WATER FOR PEOPLE FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND SO THERE'S THERE'S NOT AND THERE'S NOT AN ATTEMPT. TO TAKE AWAY THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL -- RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE AND BE ACTIVE AND TO BE AT THE TABLE THAT'S THIS WHOLE PROCESS THIS BILL AND ANTICIPATES THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND THEN ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A MEMBER OF THE BOARD. TO BE TO HAVE A MEMBER ON THE BOARD THAT REPRESENTS THEIR THEIR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR THEIR COMMUNITY AS WELL. AND WE'VE ALSO -- BOTH THAT THE SENATOR AND AND AS THE SPONSORS HAVE WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH CAL LAUGHED GO TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE A VOICE OF IN THE FUTURE OF THEIR WATER SUPPLY BUT ALSO TO WEST STREAMLINED THAT PROCESS AS AS POSSIBLE. CENTER IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY ADDRESS AT THAT CAN AS MENTION A THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A MEN'S TAKEN. THAT PUT THIS TYPE CONSOLIDATION ON A MORE OF AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THIS ONE FIRST AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE SO THOSE WERE OUR COMMENTS GOING INTO TO GOVERN FINANCE. AND AND THE AMENDED TAKEN I THINK THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE WE I FEEL THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I MEAN THE TONE I'M GETTING IS FOR MORE LIKE A SUPPORTIVE. OF AMENDED. TONE MATT AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S ALWAYS A WE'RE ALL THESE THINGS MEAN ANYWAY. BUT DONE. BUT I I YOU KNOW I DO YOU CENTER GET THE SENSE THAT. YOU'RE ON A DECENT PATH TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE ROAD JUSTICE FOLKS TODAY. WELL I HOPE. IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER IF YOU HAVE LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN RESPOND TO AND LOOK LOOK AT AND SAY YES THIS IS MIGHT WORK -- DIS THIS DOESN'T WORK OKAY BUT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT REALLY RIGHT NOW IS. WE NEED LANGUAGE AND IF. AND THEN WE CAN WORK THREAD I WERE TOTALLY OPEN TO MAKING THIS WORK AND IT'S GOT TO WORK IN IN -- IN MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR SINCE THIS IS AN INTEREST OF MINE YEAH. WHICH IS TO SOME EXTENT IS GROUND ZERO FOR THIS PROBLEM SO YES I HAVE OKAY WELL SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT SOME. YEAH YEAH MARCHING ORDERS A STARTS IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SOME LANGUAGE THE SENATOR. IS SET TO START. I THANK THE CHAIR. TO I'M HEARING FROM YOU SENATOR THE YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE URGENTLY ABSOLUTELY. AND I'M HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT CUMBERSOME NESS. AND THAT THIS ISN'T THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS WAY SO IN YOUR MIND FROM THE OPPOSITION PERSPECTIVE LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS PROCESS THROUGH LAUGH CO OR I GUESS I I'M BEHIND HIS IS THIS THE SAME IS. TWO FIFTY FOUR OR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIFTEEN YES IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE REMARKS AND WE MADE SOME WE GO WE'VE BEEN THIS IN DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR OKAY SINCE THAT WAS PASSED. AND AND WE'VE MADE SOME AMENDMENTS TO TO JUST DREAM LIKE THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT MORE WE WORK WITH LAST GOES TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO TO TO GO TO THE LEFT OF PROCESS [inaudible] GOT IT. TO THE CONCERN IS THERE'S THERE'S EVEN A MORE EXPEDITIOUS PATH AND THEN YOU'RE SEEING HERE THERE'S YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S TOO MANY CHECK BACK SO YOU YOU ALL IN THE VITAMIN A JUSTICE WORLD WANT THIS TO HAPPEN EVEN FASTER THAN WHAT. YEAH. I ALREADY IN THE ROOM WOULD LOVE TO SEE RIGHT I MEAN YEAH I THINK I THINK BUT POLICY WITH THAT THERE'S A UP A PATH TO GET THERE FASTER. AND IF WE AGAIN I DON'T I DON'T KNOW FOR THAT FAR FROM THIS BUT IF WE CAN CONFIGURE AT THE OUTSET WHAT THE BEST MECHANISM IS A FREE SS. WHAT IS THE BEST MECHANISM TO GET THE THAT THIS COMMITTEE THAT CAMINO CAN BE SAFE DRINKING WATER WHETHER IT'S? WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CURRENT CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITIES THAT EXIST WHETHER IT'S THROUGH ADMINISTRATOR HOW. ABOUT THAT. AT THE AT THE OUTSET. AND THEN NOT HAVE TO HAVE WHICH IS THE BEST IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE SHE'S PUT AN IDEA FOR TO LIKE WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE A THOUGHT YET. YEAH BUT THE ADMINISTRATOR AN ENTITY I MEAN I THINK WE'VE WORKED A LOT ON THE ADMINISTRATOR I THINK WE SEE THEIR SHARES A REALLY IMPORTANT. STEP THE ADMINISTRATOR I THINK WE SEE THE KIND OF THE ADMINISTRATOR IS PLAYING A ROLE. IN ASSESSING WHAT THE NEXT BEST. STEP FORWARD IS. AND AND JUST. TO HAVE YOUR HAND THERE IN SOME WAY OKAY. A SENSE OF WHERE THIS IS HEADED SO I APPRECIATE AS WHAT I'M TRYING TO THINK OF TWO THREE YEARS FROM NOW LIKE WE HAVE MOVEMENT OR NOT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT. WE'RE GONNA NEED WE WANT MONEY TO MOVE. WE HAVE PLENTY OF BOND FUNDS WHEN I TRY TO DO WITH -- AN M. AND AT THE SAME TIME FIX THIS IT'S A IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING PROCESS TO DO GOVERNANCE AND FUNDING RIGHT. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE UP FOR IT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT HERE IN. I'M OF THE BILL THE PROBABLY TIME I DO APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK TO A LOVED IT PLEASE KEEP THE COMMITTEE POST IF YOU CAN JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IS IT GOES FOR WHEN YOU PUT YOUR NOT COUNTER BUT YOU'RE. SEVEN YOU KNOW YOUR LANGUAGE YOUR LANGUAGE BORDERS SHORT OF WHAT YOU WHAT YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO TYPE THIS UP BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE MOVE QUICK SO LOOK FOR TO SEE INVOLVED BEFORE THE FLOOR AT THINGS. TERM COCKY. A SENDER WE'VE GIVEN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AUTHORITY TO CONSOLIDATE THREE YEARS AGO SO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST DISCUSSION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAVING. WITH THESE FEELING WATER SYSTEMS RIGHT. NOW THERE ARE A GROUP OF WATER SYSTEM SERVED IF THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE A MANDATE TO FORCE CONSOLIDATION THOSE WOULD BE THE WATER SYSTEMS WITH FOURTEEN OR LESS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. PRACTICALLY ALL FEELING TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER WHICH IS NOT ON THE BALL ON THIS ON ON ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE THEM. MY QUESTION IS YOU GOT THIS. ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE LAUGH GOES IN AND BURDENSOME ENCUMBERED WAY HAVE THESE MEETINGS DO YOU ENVISION ANY OF THESE ORPHANS THESE UNDER FOURTEEN WE DON'T HAVE A MOCK MANDATE. VOLUNTARILY COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS BEAST POTENTIAL NEW SYSTEMS. WORKABLE DO YOU SEE DO YOU SEE IS THERE SOME SPACE IN THERE FOR THE FOLKS THAT WE CAN'T MANDATE TO CONSOLIDATION TO PARTICIPATE AND IMPROVE THE DISCUSSION AND DELIVERY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE. BECAUSE IF YOU WHAT BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE ECONOMY'S. OF THE TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND THE EXPERTISE WHICH YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO SET UP. AN ENTITY THAT CAN -- CAN. ACCESS THE FUNDS GET THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AND SO IT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU'D END UP WITH A SMALL SYSTEM THAT'S IN. THE NEIGHBORING THAT SAYS I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE WE LIKE WE CAN'T WE'RE NOT PROVIDING. CLEAN DRINKING WATER EITHER AND MISTER CHAIR LAST QUESTIONS. SINCE THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS GOING ON FOR THREE YEARS AND EN IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD HAS HAS. COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT'S NOT [inaudible] PRACTICAL. FOR FEELING SYSTEM TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE CITY OF FRESNO OR CITY OR BAKERSFIELD WHEREVER. TULARE WHEREVER IT IS AND THAT IT WOULD BE MAKE MORE SENSE TO CONSOLIDATE OR MANAGE OPERATE TOGETHER WITH AN ADJACENCY FAMILY SYSTEM TO AUTUMN TWO TO IMPROVE. THE DELIVERY WATER IS IT POSSIBLE. WELL I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT -- FOR THE SENATOR I THINK THERE'S THERE'S TWO THINGS -- TWO POINTS HERE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD TO SEE HOW THIS IT'S AN AND TO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE. THEY ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THIS IDEA THEY THINK THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE HAVING AN ADJACENT SYSTEM A YOU KNOW -- ABSORB A A SMALLER STRUGGLING SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO BE FEASIBLE SO HAVING THIS OPTION IT FEELS REALLY A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ABOUT WAYS. WE CAN POTENTIALLY STREAMLINED THE PROCESS S WELL -- YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENTS THAT I CENTER TO COVER YOUR I WAS TAKING THAT REALLY ALLOW THAT CHOICE FOR THE WATER BOARD TO MAKE IS IS SOMETHING THAT THERE REALLY -- REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF IN AND WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE AS WELL [inaudible] OKAY AT COMPLICATED I'M SERVICES YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS HERE BUT I I I I I DO GET THE SENSE THAT -- THIS GOING TO BE CONTINUING DISCUSSION AND AND I I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE CENTER STEARNS I REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE BE BROUGHT IN THE LOOP AS THAT DISCUSSION CONTINUES AS YOU PRESENT YOUR LANGUAGE IS YOU. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK IT OVER AND AND AND AND TRY TO WORK OUT SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES BUT I THINK GIVE KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE WORK YOU'RE DOING IS VERY. I NEEDED SO. I WITHOUT UNSERVED HAPPY SUPPORT TODAY. AS THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STERN IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERS FOR A ROBUST DISCUSSION REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THIS SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE DEFINITELY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THIS I APPRECIATE THAT A GREAT DEAL THANK YOU. OKAY I WAS HOLLOW. ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SP FOUR ONE FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS WITH AMENDMENTS TO THE CITY SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE DATE. I HILL [inaudible] SKINNER. BY SKINNER AYE STERN STERN AYE STONE STONE I WHITE HOUSE SKI. I CASKEY I OKAY THANK YOU EVERYBODY VERY. APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK ON THIS WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE MEMBERS THAT ON AND I SEE CENTER HERTZBERG IS HERE. AND WILL BE PRESENTING TO ITEM STILL START WITH ITEM FOUR IN YOUR PACKETS MEMBERS AS SB. TWO OH FIVE THIS LICENSE IS STORM WATER DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE. MR MAJORITY LEADER YOU ARE FREE TO PROCEED -- WHEN READY? WITH THAT SB TWO ZERO FIVE TWO ZERO FIVE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WAS CAP WE CAL STATE. A BROTHERHOOD IS BROTHERHOOD. ONCE THE GERMAN ALL OF THE GERMAN MISTER SPEAKER. IT IS [inaudible] OKAY. IS MY STORM WATER BILL THE THE OKAY THIS IS THE ONE OKAY THIS THIS BILL. BASICALLY IS THIS AS YOU AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN YOUR COMMITTEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THESE NPDES PERMITS. WHEN YOU HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE RUNOFF AND THEN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SIMPLY IMPLEMENTS THOSE IN LOTS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE THAT THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS POLLUTANTS? THESE POLLUTANTS ARE REQUIRED TO GET PERMITS AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW WAS A PRACTICAL MANNER CAN WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET GREATER COMPLIANCE BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. YOU'VE GOT LIABILITY IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING HOSED BECAUSE THIS STUFF FLOWING INTO THE SYSTEM AND YOU ALSO OF LOCAL. BUSINESSES THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NEED TO COMPLY SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS TO TO REQUIRE IN THIS BILL ON WHAT WE ARE. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CITY OR COUNTY HAS A PERMIT TO SIMPLY HAVE A BOX THAT YOU CAN SAY AND PROVE THAT YOU HAVE THIS NOW THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT GOT TO COMPLIANCE OTHER LOOK ON THE WEBSITE FOR THE UNDER THE CODE TO SEE IF YOUR COMPLIANCE IS NOT A BUNCH OF EXTRA. WORK AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT FOR THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WE ALWAYS SEE THIS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPLAINING ALL GOD WERE GIVEN A MORE UNFUNDED MANDATES. THE REALITY I WOULD SUGGEST IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. FOR NOMINAL FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST ASKING THEM TO DO IT'S ALSO BY VIRTUE OF GETTING A COMPLIANCE YOU HAVE. THIS DIMMITT THIS OF A REDUCTION OF THEIR OWN RISK IN TERMS OF THE POLLUTION LOCALLY SO. WE REQUIRE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS THAT THESE ARE ENTITIES IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT OTHER SOME COUNTIES THAT DON'T REQUIRE. A BUSINESS -- YOU KNOW BUSINESS LICENSE IS FINE BUT IN THOSE COUNTIES 80% OF THOSE HAVE CITIES. I THE POLLUTION FROM THESE DEALS AND CITIES AFTER CITIES THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THERE IN YOUR ANALYSIS I DID YOU GO TO HIM SPECIFICALLY. BUT THIS IS JUST A PRACTICAL WAY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW IN THIS VERY SHARED LIABILITY AREA OF COMPLIANCE THAT WE COME UP WITH KIND OF A NIFTY IDEA -- THAT THAT HELPS IT SURE COMPLIANCE ON SOMETHING THAT HAS SUCH EXTRAORDINARY. IMPACT WE JUST SAW ON LOS ANGELES PASSING A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PARTIAL TAX TO TO TO TO CLEAN UP THE STORM WATER IT'S A BIG ISSUE WE SEE CITIES HAVE BEEN BIG PROBLEMS AND CHILLS STILL CITIES HAVING BIG PROBLEMS IN THIS REGARD. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I DON'T WAS TESTIFYING BECAUSE MY FIRST TRIP. MORNING CHECK MANY MEMBERS MENTIONED BOTTLE AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMPANY BECAUSE COMPLIANCE -- HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB TO A FIVE OH ONE MAY TWO TWO QUICK POINTS OUR FIRST IS TO JUST SOME OF THE CONCERNS RUN THE WORD CONCERTS. CONFIRM IN THE BILL WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE MUNICIPALITY TO CONFIRM WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A MUNICIPAL UP AND MUNICIPALITY TO CONFIRM WHETHER. A BUSINESS ENTITY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS WITH THIS BILL IS REQUESTING. OR ASKING THE MUNICIPAL IS TO DO IS TO CONFIRM THAT THEY NEED TO IN ROLE OR NOT AND ROLL UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT AND ALL THAT ENTAILS IS. AS I SEE CODE AND MATCHING TO WHAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS ALREADY. PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE THANKS TO THIS BILL. ARE THE SECOND PART IN POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER BUSINESS LICENSES ITS NOT THE SEXIEST ISSUE IN THE WORLD BUT IT REALLY IS AN ELEGANT SOLUTION TO A BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE ON THE STATE -- IT IS S. ME THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE OUT OF FIVE OF BUSINESS FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLED UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL PERMIT ONE OUT OF FIVE AND SO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT VOTES LET'S JUST TAKE LOS ANGELES. ARE NGUYEN WATERWAYS IMPAIRED FOR FOR WHATEVER POLLUTANT THE REGIONAL BOARD COMES UP WITH A TOTAL DAILY MAXIMUM LOAD A TMDL -- AND AND THEY CREATE THIS BY FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH OF THE LA RIVER CAN TAKE SO MUCH METALS WITHOUT BEING IMPAIRED. AND THEN THEY DIVIDE THAT UP. AMONG THE PERMIT TV'S THAT ARE DISCHARGING INTO THE RIVER DESTRUCTION METALS INTO THE RIVER BUT ONLY ONE OUT OF FIVE FACILITIES ARE AND ROLLED UNDER THE PERMIT. THAT MEANS WE'RE MISSING 80% OF THE FOLKS THAT SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR THOSE THE STARS AND SHOULD BE CONTROLLING IT. TO THE CITY OF LA THE MUNICIPALITIES ALL THE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT ARE UNDER THE PERMIT. IN ALL REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A TEAM DEAL ARE DOING IT WELL 80% DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT EXISTS AND SO THIS REALLY. IS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO IMPROVE LIABILITY FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND REALLY LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD -- FOR INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES SO AUSTERE IP THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAURIE CAMERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA METALS COALITION TODAY -- THE CMC IS -- HOME TO FOUR THOUSAND METAL COALITION COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT EMPLOY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WORKERS. AND THE NON FILER ISSUE -- AS SEAN WAS INDICATING -- AND SENATOR WAS INDICATING THIS IS A A REAL ISSUE FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO PURCHASED THE PERMITS AND END UP COMPETING WITH THOSE WHO DO NOT. HAVE A PERMIT -- IF YOU'RE PERMITTED AND THE STORM WATER RUNS OVER INTO YOUR PROPERTY THEN U. S. THE PERMIT HOLDER ARE RESPONSIBLE -- FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. SB TWO OH FIVE THANK YOU. THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT. IS THE VISION COUNTIES. WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE WE APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE MEASURE WE WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CLEAN WATER WE DO THINK IT'S A NIFTY IDEA -- THE ONE PART THAT -- THAT WAS SPOKEN. TO EARLIER IS OUR IS OUR ONE CONCERN WHICH WHICH IS JUST THAT -- A LOT OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE SYSTEM WHICH WHICH AS IT WAS HAD NOT ALL OF THEM DO. IT'S SIMPLY A IN A LOT OF HIS IS SIMPLY A MINISTERIAL SYSTEM AND SO HAVING TO CHECK. ANYTHING ACTUALLY COULD CREATE SOME AT SOME TROUBLE WITH JUST CHANGING THE WHOLE PROCESS BUT THE BUSINESS BROUGHT THAT SO INSTEAD. I WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE AN EVEN IF YOUR IDEA IS IF THE WATER BOARD WHICH IS ALREADY. WHICH IS ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING COMPLIANCE AFTER THESE BUSINESS WE JUST PASSED THE DOCUMENTS ALL I WOULD COLLECT THEM AS PART OF A BUSINESS LICENSE PROCESS AND PASS THEM ALONG. TO THE WATER BOARD THEN THEY CAN CHECK THE COMPLIANCE WHICH THEY ARE UNIQUELY. POSITIONED TO DO SO AGAIN SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A SB TOOL FIVE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MINOR AMENDMENTS TO IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON ON THIS BILL [inaudible] YES. LOW ENTRY OF INTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION SPORTS THANK YOU. MORNING AGAIN MATTHEW BAKER WITH PAYING CONSERVATION THEY CAN SUPPORT. YOU HAVE MAKE YOU ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA POLITICS MEMBERS ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENT AND GOOD FOR BUSINESS. READY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. BRENNAN DAWSON WAS HERE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. WELL SOME OF THE FRIENDS THEY ARE VERY SMART. HILL THE BAY AND WHISPERED AS WELL. THANK YOU. I'M. ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL OR OPPOSITION. YOU CAN ONE CHAIR NEVER SAID THERE DAHLE HM TO HAVE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES SO WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL AS OF RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO HELP WITH STORM WATER AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE. OF HIS OF HIS -- EFFORTS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST -- WE SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS THE US AS C. SACK ON THIS ISSUE -- THE LEAGUE. YOU KNOW IT IF IF REQUIRING CITIES TO VERIFY -- BUSINESS COMPLIANCE WITH STORE MORE PERMITTING -- COULD POSE A MAJOR ISSUE FOR SOME OF OUR CITIES BUT LIKE I SAID WE'RE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO STAFF AND HOPEFULLY WE LUCIEN ARE CONCERNED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO YOU'RE YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT. TO SORT OF THE JUST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING AN AND SOMEONE GO OVER THE YEAH THE WAY THAT HE MAY NOT SAYS YES THANK YOU MAY THE WAY MANY. CITIES ISSUE THE BUSINESS LICENSES ARE VERY A MINISTERIAL YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CHECKING OUR OR VERIFYING OF THE INFORMATION SO -- HAVING THEM ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO AND CHECK WOULD BE SETTING UP A NEW PROCESS AND MANY OF THEM ARE DOING THAT I'M ON THE THROUGH THIS ONLINE THROUGH AN ONLINE PORTAL SET BE. HAVING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO ISSUE THESE BUSINESS TAXES. THIS IS A TRICKY BECAUSE THE CITIES ARE ALSO CHOMPING AT THE BIT OVER ALL THE COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WITH CLEAN WATER ACT AND HOW IT TURNS TO BREAK BUDGETS. I'M SELF IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A SMART PLACE TO PUT AN INVESTMENT BUT I TOTALLY GET YEAH SAYS THE SMALL CITIES STRAPPED IN YEAH THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND WERE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THE DUGGAR WE DON'T HAVE THE FORMAL POSITION OF GREAT THANK YOU. TAKE CARE YES. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT NOW KNOWN AS VALLEY WATER AND WE HAVE OPPOSED THE SUBMITTED OUR POINT JUST TOOK THIS POSITION SO OUR APOLOGIES. FOR GETTING OUR LETTER IN LATE I WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH THE ON BOTH AUTHORS AS WELL AS YOUR STAFF ON OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OR ISSUES WOULD YOU WANT A RACE OKAY -- THE ITEM IS. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SO MY MATE THE BILL THE BILL OFFERS AN ONLINE PORTAL THAT CITIES CAN SHACK I'M. OF COURSE CITIES WOULD STILL HAVE. TO SO WHEN WE STILL HAVE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE WELL THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE COULD BE A LITTLE CREATIVE AND HIRE SOME STUDENT. TO TAKE THE PAGE AND A HALF OF COLDS AND PUT THEM IN ON THE FORMS WHEN YOU FILL OUT YOUR FORM YOU WOULD SIMPLY WRITE THE COLD IT WOULD MATCH OR NOT MATCH. THERE'S NO VALIDATE IN THAT THE PERSON SIGNS IN THE PENALTY OF PERJURY IN YOUR COAT THIS IS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE. IN GOVERNMENT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO WE'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE TAKING A BIG BURDEN FOR THE NON LAW BLIGHTED CITIZENS WE THEN GOT A WHOLE BIG GIGANTIC RISK THAT EVERYBODY HAS BECAUSE OF CRUMMY WATER THAT RUNS OFF OF WITH THAT FEDERAL LWS AND BIG. FINES EVERYBODY'S GOING CRAZY CAT DO WE HAVE CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE CREEK IF THE YEAR YOU CAN SIMPLY EASILY DO WANNA IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION YOU JUST LIKE. YOU'RE GOING TO GO ONLINE WE ALL WANTED WAS ON THESE OTHER COMPANIES YOU FILL OUT IF YOU PUT THE WRONG NUMBER IT REJECTS IT IF YOU PUT A PHONE NUMBER IN OKAY. FOR AFFORDABLE YOU SUDDENLY IF THE PENALTY OF PERJURY FOR PURPOSES OF THE PAGE AND A HALF OF CODE SECTIONS RIGHT IT'S NOT HARD TO FIX THIS IS ONE OF THESE ISSUES WHERE YOU KNOW I CHAIRED THE EXCEPTIONS COMMITTEE. BIGELOW GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE THAT YOU KNOW YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT LAUGH CO THAT I WROTE THAT LAW WAY BACK WHEN AND ALL THESE EXCEPTIONS. YEAH WE JUST FRICKIN GET CREATIVE FOR ONCE IN OUR LIFE AND TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE THE DELIVERABLES HERE ARE LAW ABIDING POKES THAT ARE DOING THE LAW. AND EVERY ONE OF THESE COUNTIES AND CITIES GOT HUGE RISKS THIS IS NOT A HARD TO FIGURE OUT. ALL ONE WORD ABOUT RISK ALL MORE ABOUT MONEY THAT'S THE SAME EXCUSE EVERYWHERE LET'S GET PAST IT. WHAT WHAT IS WHAT ABOUT WOULD BE THE WORD AT RISK WHAT WITH THE RESULT BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING WELL I'M GONNA HAVE THE RISK IS I GOT TO GO AND CHECK THIS OUT AND MY PEOPLE MAKE A MISTAKE THERE MIGHT BE A RISK IN THERE'S THIS PROBLEM NOW THE PERSON? SIGNS LE PEN PERDUE CHECK THE CODE SECTION YOU COULD LITERALLY DOWNLOAD THE CODE. AND SOMEONE HAS TO FILL IN THIS IS NOT A HARD PROBLEM TO SOLVE. AND WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE SPEAKER HE HE THEIR INCOME ON OPPOSITION NO NO NO I KNOW YOU KNOW I'M JUST I'M JUST FRUSTRATED BECAUSE TRYING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE WORK GOVERNMENT IS GETTING SLOWER AND SLOWER. AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS GETTING FASTER AND FASTER AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THINK DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOSING CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. AND WE JUST GOT TO GET OUT OF THOSE ALL WHAT'S NOT ONLY THAT'S RIGHT THERE IS THE THINKING ABOUT IT IS A HUGE LIABILITY THAT IS COMING DOWN ON A LOT OF CITIES I KNOW I WANT I ONE OF MY CITIES HAS LIKE A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET. AND A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY PERMITS IN THAT CITY ARE ARE NOT ARE NOT. ENTITIES THAT AREN'T PERMITTED THAT SHOULD BE ENTITY AND WHY SHOULD DEEPER PARTICIPATING AND WOULD THAT HELP YOUR CITY RIGHT. A LOT YEAH. YEAH YEAH [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. GOOD WELL -- APPRECIATE. YEAH AS A QUESTION FROM CENTER STERN YEAH SO JUST TO JUST TO CONFIRM HERE WE'RE TALKING. WE'RE WE'RE NOT TAKING MEDI COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION LIKE WHETHER THEY'RE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR MS FOR WHATEVER YOU CALL THEIR INDUSTRIAL PARK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A AS UP HOSTING OUT OF THEIR CLASSIFICATION. SO WHETHER THEY'RE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE IS THAT ESSENTIALLY WITH HIS BILL AS AS AS WE'RE GONNA BASS HAVE AN ACCURATE INVENTORY OF ALL THE ENTITIES THAT. OUR SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE YEAH. WORD ENROLLMENT SO THEY'RE SUBJECT WHEN ROLLING UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL PERMIT WE ARE NOT NOT IN ANY WAY ASKING IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THE PERMIT THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE REGIONAL BOARD. AND THE STATE BOARD AND HE WOULD NEVER HAS THE MUSE AND BY FILLING OUT THAT PERFORM THESE COMPANIES THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY. THE PEOPLE IN HER WORLD THAT ARE NOT COMPLYING 80% RIGHT AT LEAST IT PUTS A FOR A PLACE ON THE FORM THIS IS A WAY BETTER THINK ABOUT THIS WELL THAT'S RIGHT AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I WONDER MARK. I I I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SAW BILL WHERE THE METALS COALITION AND COAST PEOPLE RIGHT NOW DIES OR WHERE THE CRAFT THE SCRAPPERS OR ENERGY SEE ARE ALSO RISE WORDS ARE VERY. I'M CONFUSED AND I AND AND AND IS STANDING IN ADMIRATION FRANKLY OF OF FINDING SOME THROUGH PATH HERE BUT WHO WHO IS IT WHO IS MISSING RIGHT NOW LIKE. YOU KNOW FOR FOR ANY FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE LIKE WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT WILL POP OUT. FROM THIS WHO WHO WHO DOESN'T KNOW. THAT THEIR SUBJECT TO THIS YET OR WHO MIGHT WE BE MISSING IN THE FRAME. FROM OUR EXPERIENCE FROM. MORE MEDIUM TO SMALLER BUSINESSES THE AUTO JUST METALLERS OR ONE THAT POP OUT THAT AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE BILLS WITH AUTO DISMANTLING INDUSTRY BEFORE TO ADDRESS THIS TO THE DMV SO THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE LEGISLATION TO THIS -- THE METAL RECYCLERS THE THE THE LARGER FOLKS IN THE THE WASTE WALL WATER FOLKS USUALLY ARE UNDER THE PERMIT ALREADY. AGAIN I WOULD AGREE WITH SEAN TO AYE TO TURN OUT OVER CASEY HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY BUT YES% I'M SENATOR WE'RE COMPETING IS SMALL BUSINESSES WITH THOSE WHO KNOW THEY SHOULD FILE OR CHOOSE NOT TO FIGHT RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE PAINT WHERE THE LAW ABIDING EMPLOYEE. LAWYERS HAVING TO COMPETE YEARS ABJECT RIGHT YOU'RE YOU'RE RYING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW BUT THAT THEY'RE SORT OF THE FLY BY NIGHTERS A I SEE. UNDERSTOOD YEAH HELP THE OTHER THING I I'M JUST TO TAKE CHARGE PRIVILEGE YOU KNOW I I HEARD -- ARE CHAIR EMERITUS MENTIONED THE OTHER FOLKS OUR SCHOOLS RIGHTS GOT ME COLLEGES. ON EFFECTIVE YOU LOOK AT PAGE SEVEN OUNCES IT REFERS A BILL THAT WE DID I DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT -- TRIES TO PUSH THAT ENVELOPE FOR BUT SCHOOLS YOU KNOW FOR GOOD REASONS ARE GIVEN AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE AND FROM A LOT OF THINGS -- BUT THEY ALSO END UP HAVING A LOT OF BLACK TOP IN A LOT OF RENT SPACE AND AND ACTUALLY THERE OFTENTIMES. BEHIND WAY BEHIND CITIES IN TERMS OF USING BEST PRACTICES OF STRONG WATER CAPTURE AND SWELLS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO BE BETTER ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING AND AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER. SO WE WE WE DID A BILL -- THE COUPLE YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW ENCOURAGEDTHE DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES AND AND REAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DIVISION STATE ARCHITECT AND INDEPENDENT SERVICES IN SCHOOL ON THIS BUT THAT'S OF THAT CONTINUES TO BE STICKING POINT TWO FOR CITIES. YEAH OKAY SO I YEAH SO I THINK CENTERS INNER BY MOVED TO FIRST -- SO -- WITH THAT DIED AT THE CENTRE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I JUST REMEMBER THINKING WHEN ACROSS. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A SEARCH OF HIS CAR. ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB. TWO OH FIVE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE BATES. BATES AYE HILL. I SKINNER. SKINNER AYE STERN STERN AYE STONE STONE I Y. CASKEY SB I'D. OKAY SEVEN ZERO AND THAT'S FANTASTIC I THINK THA. THAT THAT BILLS OUT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO OPEN THE ROLE IN THAT I KNOW SAID IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YOU WANT TO GO PRESENTED GOVERNANCE FINANCE. GOVERNMENT FINANCE CENTER THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN A MINUTE OKAY. FANTASTIC OKAY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU GOOD DISCUSSION SOME OF THE PAST OF THE TRAVEL BACK TO THE VICE CHAIR AND I'M GONNA PRESENT SB. THREE NINETY TWO NOW THIS. NEXT HALF COULD YOU DO THIS BECAUSE I CAN GO ON EDUCATION FOR SHOULD I ANSWER [inaudible] YES. YEAH TORTURE MURDERS YEAH. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEREDITH IN FACT IT'S ACTUALLY WRITTEN HERE JERRY MEREDITH BECAUSE I THINK WE ANTICIPATED. TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. ODD. MEMBERS ARE YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING HEARING. NOT TOO LONG AGO ON CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IT WAS OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE DID WITH. A SOMBER CORKS COMMITTEE. AND LEARN ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND THIS COMES OUT OF THAT HEARING IN A AN IMPORTANT REPORT THAT'S HAPPENED -- IN THIS GREEN CHEMISTRY SPACE SO THIS BILL. UPDATES AND STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM. HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. FOLKS KNOW THAT ON TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THAT WAS DISCUSSED AND WITH CENTER CALL YOUR HOUSE BILL. I'VE BEEN SELLING MEMBER MIGHT FEAR IS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND SENATOR. SIMIANS ASKED FIVE ON NINE THE PROGRAM DID CAN I RECOGNIZE THREE KEY THINGS ONE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE SOMETIMES A KNOWINGLY EXPOSED. TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE TO THAT THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING THEM. AND THREE THAT USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN A CLEAR TRANSPARENT REGULATORY PROCESS IS THE BEST WAITED TO DO THIS AND AND SO THE DEPARTMENT TALKS UPS CONTROL DGSE TOOK THE LEGISLATURE'S MANDATE. AND IT DEVELOPED THE FIRST OF ITS KIND SEE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM THAT WE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT EARLIER. NOW THE ON THE SERVER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM FIRST IDENTIFIES CHEMICALS OF CONCERN AND THEN IT FINDS PRODUCTS WHERE THOSE CHEMICALS. MAY BE AFFECTING USERS PEOPLE. I DGSE THEN CALLS UPON MANUFACTURERS TO PERFORM AN ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS. TO FIND CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE SUBSTITUTED TO KEEP FOLK SAFE FOR A WHILE STILL PROVIDING. FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY WANT AND NEED. NOW THE GOALS IN FRAMEWORK OF THE SEA FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM ARE COMMENDABLE BUT WELL WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THIS BILL SB THREE TWENTY THREE NINETY TWO TO YOU IS THE PROGRAM'S.% TIMELINE. I TODAY NO CHEMICAL NO CHEMICAL. I WAS TEN YEARS IT. HAS HAD AN ALTERNATE ANNOUNCES COMPLETED UNDER THE CERTIFICATE SUMA PRODUCTS PROGRAM. NO REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED. HI SO GREAT FRAMEWORK. VERY LITTLE OF SUBSTANCE TO CONSUMERS AS ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THAT LAUDABLE FRAMEWORK AND AND SYSTEM. AND IN FACT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED AT OUR HEARING. WAS THIS. REPORT FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. A LOOK BACK AT THE FIRST TEN YEARS THE PROGRAM AND WHAT'S CAUSING THE SLOWDOWN CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AGE. TEN AND EVALUATION OF ITS PROGRESS AND PROMISE AT YOU MEMBERS WILL RECALL DOCTOR SOLLENTUNA SOLOMON. PRESENTING. SO MY BILL TAKES. TO SOME OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS REPORT TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM AND ULTIMATELY ALLOW OUR GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. AND HERE'S WHAT IT DOES SPECIFICALLY BUILDING OFF OF THIS REPORT. I A GRANTS DGSE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA FROM MANUFACTURES AND IF NEEDED FROM THEIR CHEMICAL SUPPLIERS. IT ADDS NEW AUTHORITATIVE LIST OF CHEMICALS OF CONCERN TO FILL GAPS IN THE CURRENT LIST. IT REQUIRES THE TSC TO ADOPT A FIVE YEAR TIMELINE. TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS PRIORITY PRODUCTS INCLUDING DATA COLLECTION A FUNCTION BASED APPROACH TO AVOID. REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SO THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE WHERE YOU DON'T WANT. TO JUST REPLACE ONE GUY CHEMICAL WITH ANOTHER IT'S GOING TO BE JUST AS DAMAGING. THAT'S REFERRED IS REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION WONDERFUL TERM OF ART. I ND IT FINALLY IT STREAMLINES THE INFORMAL RESOLUTION AN APPEALS PROCESS HE'S AN INCREASE A FAST TRACK. FOR WHEN EXISTING STUDY SUPPORT REGULATORY RESPONSES SOMETIMES -- IT STUDIES OUT THERE. THAT TRY TO BE A BROUGHT INTO THE CONVERSATION -- BUT UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN DOING THAT SO I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY I'LL BE KERR FROM NOT TO RESOURCE DEFENSE COUNCIL AND AN INJURY OF INTER FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION. HIGHLIGHTS ALSO IN THE BILL ALL YOU DO IS COMING FROM I AM FROM A WORKING GROUP. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE NINETY TWO FIRST WITNESS. OKAY MY GUESS. HELLO I'M ANDREA VENTURE AS YOU HEARD FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A BRIEF AND IT TO BRING US BACK TO WHY THIS IS A PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT AND THEN WHY THE BILL IS IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE CAN GET WRAPPED UP SENIOR ROOM. LIKE THIS WITH JUST LEGISLATION AND REGULATION BUT THIS DOES AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. AND THE PROMISE OF THIS PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN AN INKLING OF IT BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- THAT WE SHOULD RE REMEMBER I'M FOR INSTANCE SYNTHETIC FLAME RETARDANT SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS LOOKED AT ITSELF -- HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN CHILDREN'S NAP MATS BY THIS PROGRA. THOSE CHEMICALS ACTUALLY ARE LINKED TO CANCER THEY BECAUSE A THYROID DESTRUCTION OF MEMORY AND LEARNING PROBLEMS CAN EVEN IN FACT IMPACT THE A PERSON'S DNA. ARM WRESTLING CHLORIDE SOMETHING THAT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS LOOKING AT NOW IN REGULATING IN PAINT STRIPPERS HAVEN'T SALTED IN AT LEAST SIXTY FOUR DEATHS THESE ARE THE ONES WE KNOW ABOUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD INDIVIDUAL IN HUNTINGTON PARK CALIFORNIA WHO WAS ON THE JOB AND WAS FOUND DEAD IN A BATHROOM WHEN HE WAS STRIPPING AT A BATH TUB. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE REAL CALIFORNIANS WORKERS AND CONSUMERS -- AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT PER ANNUM BUT AS THE SENATOR HAS SAID. WOW THIS PROGRAM IS EXTRAORDINARILY INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT IS REALLY MEANT NOT TO JUST DEAL WITH CHEMICALS WITH THEIR IT'S OBVIOUS WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THEM BUT WHERE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS. ARM IT IS NOT MOVING THE DOES NOT FOR FILLING IN ITS ITS PROMISE. AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO ADDRESS CHEMICAL SPECIFICALLY. FOR FEAR OF BEING US INTO THOSE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SITUATIONS. AND SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS MAKE THIS PROGRAM. WORK SO WE REALLY ARE PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR CALIFORNIANS -- IV IS GOING TO GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND EXPAND ON WHAT THE SENATORS SAID ABOUT THE BILL. I JUST WANT TO END BY SAYING THAT. WELL OVER THE TEN YEARS WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH PROGRESS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE REGULATORY PROCESS MOVING. QUICK ENOUGH AND REALLY AREN'T MOVING US DOWN. THE ROAD WHY AND CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND IN THAT IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. I'M WHAT WE ARE. ARSENE IT WELL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WHEREWHERE. THE BARRIERS ARE FOR THE PROGRAM TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO REALLY WITH THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS TAKE A SURGICAL APROACH. TO TO THE ISSUES ADDRESSED THE DATA GAP ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER -- INEFFICIENCIES ADMINISTRATIVE INSUFFICIENCIES THAT ARE STOPPING THE PROGRAM FROM MOVING FORWARD IT'S NOT MEANT TO RE DEFINE IT OR TO RE DEFINE -- ITS INTENT IT'S REALLY TO MAKE THOSE FIXES SO THAT WE CAN OPTIMIZE SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR PEOPLE. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AVINASH CAR AND I'M WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ADDRESSING TOXIC CHEMICALS BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM THAT IS FOCUSING ON PREVENTING TALKS EXPORTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OR FIXING THE HARMS AFTER THE FACT. MY COLLEAGUE ENTER VENTURE INTO SENATOR HAVE OUTLINED BUT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM. AND A RECENT TEN YEAR RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW BY DR SOLOMON IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE ALSO OUTLINED BY THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL THE PROGRAM AND THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT ARE HOLDING IT BACK. MAKING A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AS BETWEEN NINETY TO ADDRESS IS A NUMBER OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOULD REMOVE SEVERAL OF THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS -- HOLDING THE PROGRAM BACK. ONE KEY ISSUE IS THE PROGRAM'S LACK OF ACCESS TO PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA. PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AND UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY REQUESTS TO GET INFORMATION ON PRODUCT INGREDIENTS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS AND HESITATION SIX TO CONSIDER ALL THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS MAKING A PRODUCT AND SAFE. SB THREE NINE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT CLEARER STRONGER DATA COLLECTION AUTHORITY THE STILL PRESERVES THE TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY. THE SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF DEADLINES AND CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED TIMELINES FOR ACTION. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK PLANS HAVE BEEN RATHER VAGUE THEY'RE NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE MEANINGFUL AND THEY FACILITATE THE LENGTHY DELAYS THAT I'VE BEEN UNFORTUNATE FEATURE THE PROGRAM SO FAR. AND SB THREE NINE TWO WOULD REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO DEVELOP A WORK PLAN TO ADDRESS FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES OR SUB CATEGORIES IN FIVE YEARS. INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIMELINES FOR THE VARIOUS STEPS IN THE PROCESS. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CONSIDERATION OF ALL CHEMICALS THAT SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE OR FUNCTION TO ADDRESS THE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION. THAT SENATOR ALLEN ALLUDED. TO THESE MEASURES WILL PROVIDE CLEARER PROCESS IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND WILL ENSURE THE PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE TO REVIEWS REVISIT THE PRODUCT A FEW YEARS TIME -- THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL HELP WITH THE NEED FOR BETTER PRIORITIZATION TO THE PH I. REPORT OUTLINES. A THIRD FACTOR IS THE CURRENT LONG AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH OF EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CHEMICALS BEING ADDRESSED. CURRENTLY NEW COMPANY DRIVEN ANALYSES ARE REQUIRED FOR EVERY MANUFACTURER THAT PRODUCES A PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE AGENCY CAN ACT. EVEN WHEN INFORMATION -- ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE FOR RELIABLE SOURCES. INSTEAD FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PH I REPORT. WHEN SUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND ONLY THEN AS BE THREE NINE TWO CREATES A FAST TRACK OPTION THAT ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO ACT MORE QUICKLY AND DIRECTLY? WHILE ENSURING THAT THERE IS PUBLIC NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT INCLUDING FROM THE AFFECTED BUSINESSES. THIS WILL SPEED UP THE PROCESS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. IT COULD ALSO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON FROM SMALL COMPANIES THAT -- MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY CONDUCTING THEIR ALL ATTORNEYS ANALYSES AND WOULD BE WOULD FACE A DRAIN ON RESOURCES FROM THAT. FINALLY SB THREE NINE TWO ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO REMOVE REDUNDANCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND TO STREAMLINE THE PROGRAMS A WORKLOAD THAT WILL ALSO HELP IMPROVE THE PACE OF THE PROGRAM. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE NINE TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A BILL ALLEY -- ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP THE THIRD A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I JUST WANNA POINT OUT WERE WORKING -- RAPIDLY WITH THE OPPONENTS TO THE BILL I TO MAKE SURE THAT -- DETAILS ARE FINE TUNE IN WEEK A COMPROMISE AS WELL AS WE CAN TO KEEP THE BILL STRONG. ONE POINT OUT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH FORM THE PROGRAM IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PASSED NEARLY UNANIMOUSLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THIS BILL ALSO END UP WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BECAUSE WERE CONSUMERS COME FIRST YEAR AND WE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO SEE IT THE MORE EFFICIENT THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF A SB. THREE NINE TWO MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. BILL MCGOVERN COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT.

OPPOSITION IF OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. THE MACHINE AT THE TABLE THIS IS. GET AFTER A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TIM JUST IT WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- SURROUNDS KEEPING BUSY THE SESSION -- YOU'RE KIDDING ME TO REACH THE NEW JOB RATINGS I THINK YOU THANK YOU SO -- WE WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSED POSITION ON THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED I I DO WANT TO THANK. ERIC WALTERS AND SENT AROUND STAFF OF FOR CAN BEING -- CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH THE OPPONENTS OR THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL -- I'VE I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS A A VERY -- PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION AND L. L. IN IN LIGHTNING US ON SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE GET WE HAVE RAISED SO. THREE POINT I I JUST WANNA MAKE BRIEFLY ON THE A A PROVISION THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BILL -- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED -- WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT HOW. PTSD WOULD RELY ON THAT INFORMATION -- THAT MAYBE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO SURE INSURE THAT IT DOES MEET THE SAME RIGOROUS CRITERIA THAT AN A THAT WE WOULD PRODUCE AS A RESPONSIBLE ENTITY FOR EXAMPLE. WOULD HAVE TO MEET SO THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE I THINK -- WE WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH -- CENTER ALLEN ON ON DEVELOPING SOME ADDITIONAL. CRITERIA AROUND THAT AROUND HOW THAT USED A SINGLE SHOE FOR THE DATA CALLING PROVISION -- FRANKLY I THINK THIS COULD BE HELPFUL FOR D. T. S. C. -- TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS -- CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS THEY MAY MAKE. BUT AGAIN WE LIKE TO SEE SOME CLARITY ON THAT PROCESS MAYBE SOME TIME LINES OF HOW LONG -- A RESPONSIBLE AND HE COULD HAVE TO IN ORDER TO RIP TORESPOND TO THOSE DATA CALL AND REQUEST MAKE THEM REASONABLE -- WE YOU KNOW IT. SUGGESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE YOU KNOW A WEEK OR TWO TO RESPOND TO A DATA CALLING REQUIREMENT WE WOULD PROBABLY FIND THAT UNREASONABLE BUT SOME SORT OF REASONABLE TIME FRAME -- WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE -- CENTER AROUND THE SPONSORS TO LOOK AT SOME EXISTING DATA CALLING AUTHORITY THAT CALLIE PA HAS OF FOR AS A POTENTIAL MODEL AT LEAST TO TO TO TO MAYBE CONSIDER FOR FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- THE THIRD POINT FOR TURNED OVER TO A MISS KEPT HE IS -- THERE'S A PROVISION EXPAND THE CANADA CHEMICALS LISTS WERE REALLY SORT OF UNCLEAR WHY THAT PROVISIONS IN THERE AND WHETHER IT'S IT'S EVEN NECESSARY -- THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE EIGHT THE LIST OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PLUS CHEMICALS ON US CANADA HEMICALS LIST. IF THE INTENT IS TO EXPEDITE -- REVIEW AND MOVE THIS PROGRAM ALONG WE THINK THERE CERTAINLY UNIVERSE OF OF CHEMICALS TO CHOOSE FROM -- THERE IS A PETITION PROCESS AVAILABLE FOR STAKEHOLDERS IF THEY THINK THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL -- CANADA CHEMICALS -- THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION THAT -- FOLKS WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SO I GUESS THAT WE ARE STILL OPPOSE THE BILL VISUALLY BUT LOOK FOR THE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND AND HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THE DAY. COME COME SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON KHAKI ON BEHALF OF THE CALIORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION -- ALSO SIMILARLY SITUATED ON AS MR SZOSTAK OPPOSED CURRENTLY TO THE CURRENT VERSION BILL OF IT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH STAFF. AS WELL AS OTHER PROPONENTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS A SIMILAR -- COMMENTS -- TO TO MISTER SUSPECTS IN TERMS OF CONCERNS AROUND KIND OF THE A. R. PROVISIONS IN THE BILL CURRENTLY WANTING TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT THE INTENT AS WE'VE CONVEY CONVERSED AND CHATTED WITH THE PROPONENTS OF AND THEY'VE INDICATED IS REALLY WERE MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS AN APPLES TO APPLES -- CONSIDERATION WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING OUT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE GOVERNMENT RELATED -- ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS -- PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN KIND OF BETTER CLARIFICATION AND KIND OF REFINEMENT TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING OUT AND CONSIDERING THOSE TYPES OF A A SET OR NOT PERHAPS ARE CONDUCTED BY THE MANUFACTURERS. I THAT WERE CONSIDERING THE TRADE OFFS AND AWAITING CRITERIA THAT WENT INTO COMING TO THE CONCLUSION OF THAT TO ENSURE THAT IF YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION THAT'S IN SCOPE UNDER DTS SEES APPROACH. I AM IS KIND OF SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO THE A A THAT WOULD BE EVALUATED SO THAT WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT OUR EVALUATING THE VARIOUS TRADE OFFS YOU KNOW IF THE PRODUCT TOXICITY IS THE ISSUE FORTY TSC. BUT ALTERNATIVES ON MAY BE KIND OF FOCUSED MORE KIND OF AND CONCERNING A RELATIVE TO HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS THERE WERE CONSIDERING THOSE TYPES OF TRADE OFFS ON AND TO AND WEEDING FACTORS. I'M ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE DATA CALL AND WE WOULD ALSO -- JUST ECHO AND THAT TOO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE STRENGTHENING DAD BUILDING UPON SOME AUTHORITIES DO TO SEE ALREADY HAS. AND MAKING SURE THAT RELATIVE TO THAT UT IT'S REALLY CONFINED IN AND KIND OF FOCUSED ON ON THOSE PRIORITIES ON THAT PTC IS FOCUSED ON IN AND AROUND THE pJUST COME A BROAD FISHING EXPEDITION A WITHOUT FOCUS AND TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE PRIORITIES AT HAND. AB AND THEN FINALLY AGE WITH REGARD TO THE CHEMICALS LIST WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE EXPANSION OF THAT. ARE CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IS LOOKING OUT TO ANA CHEMICALS LISTS ARE THAT WILL EXCEED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS SO TODAY NOT CAN EXTEND THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PACE OF THE PROGRAM. ADDING ADDITIONAL CHEMICALS TO THAT MIX TO KIND OF CONSIDER FOR PRIVATIZATION YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE -- AND EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY SLOWING DOWN THAT BUT NONE THE LESS -- SEEMS HE'S DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS WOULD YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES AND A PATH FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPOSED -- TO SB. THREE NINETY GOOD MORNING NICOLE CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION AND THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION JUST -- ONE ASSOCIATE MY CONCERNS WITH THOSE -- ALREADY LISTED AND JUST PUT A FINER POINT ON THE ADDITIONAL LESS ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL LIST AS THE E. U. FRAGRANCE ALLERGEN LESSON THIS LIST WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON LABELS FOR CONSUMERS -- WE WERE CONCERNED WITH THERMAL ALLERGIES AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT -- RACES TO THE SAME LEVEL OF HEALTH CONCERNS THAT THAT THEY FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO ADDRESS SO I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT LIST IN PARTICULAR BEEN REMOVED THANK YOU. TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA -- OPPOSED WHERE -- THE REASONS OUTLINED AND I'D ALSO I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO CONVEY -- ON BEHALF OF ADAM REGULAR OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHO WAS CALLED AWAY -- ON UNEXPECTEDLY A FEW MOMENTS AGO -- HIS CONCURRENCE WITH THE OPPOSITION POSITION AS OUTLINED. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY PERSONALLY -- I TOO WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY -- THAT WE MAY WELL BE ABLE TO FIND SOME MORE COMMON GROUND HERE THAN WE HAD FIRST THOUGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ORINDA VALENCIA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PAINT COUNCIL IN THE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE C. C. AND C. MTA -- I THINK OF SPECIFIC FOR OUR OUR CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY MORE AROUND THE A LANGUAGE CURRENTLY BUT LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS AND SEE IF THERE'S WAYS TO REFINE SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE AND I'M CONTINUE TO COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE OTHER STUFF THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LARISSA SATURDAYS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TôI ASSOCIATION WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH MISTER CYSTIC THAN MS KEPT KEYS. ARE COMMENTS REGARDING SB. THIRTY THREE NINETY TWO ARE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE SAFER CONSUMER OF PRODUCTS PROGRAM -- BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY AND WORK OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS AND I'D ALSO ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT THANK YOU. RESEARCHER IF I COULD ALSO JUST SAY MY APOLOGIES -- MANDY LIED ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL AND WAS ALSO PULLED AWAY SHE WANTED TO ALIGN HERSELFAS WELL. VERY GOOD LET'S RETURN IT BACK TO THE DAIS -- QUESTION CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- CERTAINLY WE WANT TO SEE -- SAFE CONSUMER PRODUCTS OUT THERE SENATOR ALLEN -- CUP JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- THIS WILL ALLOW -- DTS HE TO USE THE STUDIES THAT ARE OUT -- IN THE COMMUNITY IF YOU WILL -- TO EXPEDITE THE REVIEW -- OF CHEMICALS -- HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT -- WE'RE LOOKING AT PEER REVIEWED NON BIASED STUDIES. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN I I I I MEAN IT DOES SAY SPECIFICALLY -- IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE EIGHT OF THE BILL. DID ANY ANNOUNCES THE DEPARTURE LIES ON PRCEED SUBDIVISIONS OF ISSUE BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR CREDIBLE INSTITUTION WITH RELEVANT EXPERTISE IN WITHOUT FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SELF -- IT IT IT LAYS OUT. THOSE HIGH STANDARDS THAT CERTAINLY. IF YOU WANT. TO STRENGTHEN THEM -- HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION YEAH. HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR MENTAL THING IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF ASSEMBLY MANUFACTURES YEAH -- AND THEN -- I THINK THAT THE OPPONENTS OF BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT -- HERE WE HAD TEN YEARS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD -- ONE SIGNIFICANT REVIEW -- AND YET YOU WANT NOW ADD MORE -- CHEMICALS TO THAT LIST WHICH IS GONNA DILUTES THE REVIEW OF THE EXISTING -- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ONE OF THE ONE OF THE UPPER OPPONENTS MENTIONED THAT -- AN ALLERGEN LESS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN BEEN ADDED WHICH MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL THAT THE TSC SHOULD BE REVIEWING THOSE AT ALL. SO THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE PACE OF THE PROGRAM CAN YOU CAN YOU. TALK ABOUT -- Y. EXPANDED THE LIST AND WHY THESE ALLERGENS YOU THINK ARE EFFICACIOUS TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST. I'LL LET ARMENIAN TO THE BOTH OF YOU REALIZE THEY DON'T HAVE TO REVIEW THE CHEMICALS AND THIS IS JUST THIS YOU KNOW WE WOULD TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND SO -- SO MIND CHEMICALS OF COMMERCE ITSELF RIGHT IS A VERY SMALL ADDITION IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A BROADER CONTEXT AND GRANT THEM IT JUST IT JUST ADDS TO THE IF YOU GIVE A LITTLE MORE THEY CAN REVIEW. BY ADOPTION I WE CAN. YEAH. AS A CENTER SAYS IT JUST ALLOWS AND TO CONSIDER THE CHEMICALS THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO ACT ON IT AND SO GIVES YOU MORE CHOICE I THINK ABOUT IT BUT THE ONLY PRIORITIZE CHEMICALS. WHICH POSE A HEALTH RISK AND THAT RISE TO THAT LEVEL SOME OF THESE ALLERGENS CAN BE A AS A RISKS AND SO RIGHT HAVING IT IN THERE ARE LAWS AND TO CONSIDER THOSE REST IF THEY RISE TO THAT LEVEL BUT I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. OKAY BUT YOU'RE STILL EXPANDING THE THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEY CAN INVESTIGATE WHICH THEY CAN CONSIDER TAKE AWAY FROM MAYBE SOME OF THE MORE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WHICH IS A CONCERN. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A RATING SYSTEM AMONG THE CHEMICALS -- THAT MIGHT GUIDE THE DTS SEE TO SPEND THE RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATELY NESSA'S BILL CLINTON ANYMORE STAFF WELL I THINK THAT THE TSC IS A DECK TO AGENCY WITH EXPERTISE ON THIS TOPIC AND THEY PRIORITIZE INTERNALLY LA THAT PRIORITIZE ASIAN OUT IN THE WORK PLANS THAT THEY PUT TOGETHER. AND SO THEY HAVE TO LAY OUT A RATIONALE FOR WHY THEY'RE DRESSING THE PARTICULAR SECTOR CHEMICALS A PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE AND IT WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT SO -- WE WE THINK IT'S FAIRLY UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S A MINOR HEALTH CONCERN AND PUT IN THE WORK. WE ALSO -- AND THEN LASTLY -- WHILE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE WAS DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MEETINGS THAT HAVE A SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS CAN YOU -- TALK ABOUT -- THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF SOME OF THOSE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE PROPRIETARY IN NATURE THAT OBVIOUSLY THE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU IF YOU GOT A PRODUCT I'M GONNA THROW ANOTHER WD FORTY OKAY WELL YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK THE PROPRIETORS OF MANUFACTURES THAT PRODUCT ONE OUT THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE OF THEIR PUBLICIZING MAYBE SOMETHING IS VERY SIMPLE MAYBE SOME A COMPLICATED. BUT HOW DO WE PROTECT THE MANUFACTURERS FROM SOME OF THEIR THERE'S THEIR PROPER I REMEMBER ONE NIGHT WHEN THIS BILL IS VERY FIRST PITCH TO ME BY MY BY MY STAFF MY FANTASTIC STAFFER HERE TEAM THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE PROTECT. ON A TRADE SECRETS AND AND PREPARE TO INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE A THEY BASICALLY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE I'M SURE ONE OF THE ONE OF YOU GUYS CAN DESCRIBE IT BUT IT. GOVERNMENT ASKED. FOR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALL THE TIME -- AND THERE'S A STRICT PROCEDURE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T GET A SHARED AND AND AND AND AND AND THAT THAT THAT OF THE DOES TRADE SECRETS ARE ARE NOT COMPROMISE BUT AND IF YOU WANNA SPEAK. YEAH JUST A ONE ONE QUICK ADDITION THANK YOU SENATOR WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO THESE PROVISIONS AND THAT. WE HAVE BEEN VISION THAT THE THAT WAY THROUGHOUT AND IF WE WIN THIS ANY PROBLEMS IN THE PAST -- ANY TRADE SECRETS BEING WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT AND OF COURSE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES YOU KNOW THEY THEY STILL GET INFORMATION AND THE STILL HAVE TO KEEP THEM SECRET AND THAT THE AGENT AGENCY WOULD BE UNDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY -- AND WE THINK THEY'RE CAPABLE OF MEETING THAT. YOUR ANSWERS IF. ETCETERA WE COULD YOU CLARIFY THERE IS THE AMERICAN COVER CHEMICALS ASSOCIATION -- TESTIFIED THAT THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THE CHEMICALS OF CONCERN ABOUT LIST TO BE EXPANDED CLEARLY INDUSTRY DOESN'T WANT TO BE NOBODY WANTS TO BE ON THE LIST ARE PART. OF WHATEVER IT IS SENT BACK BUT CLARIFY WHAT THE IS IT IN CUMBERSOME THE PROCESS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW TO EXPAND THE LIST -- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS PROGRAM WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR ALL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS TO GO FOR THE REVIEW PROCESS SO THAT'S SAID SO THAT'S THAT BUT THAT BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE FOR FOR OPTING IN. WHAT'S THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THAT THAT THAT WE WANT TO GIVE THE DETAILS SEE THE AUTHORITY. WELL I I I I MEAN I I THINK THAT THIS THE CURRENT SHORTCOMINGS ARE THE I WELL I I THINK I WILL BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DID YOU SEE THERE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS RIGHT. AND THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY INVESTIGATE EVERY SINGLE CHEMICAL WITH THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY I THINK THAT. SOME OF US WOULD -- WOULD HOPE THAT THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. BUT WE WANT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE THAT THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH THEIR OWN PRIVATIZATION INTERNALLY AND THEY DO. THAT THE THE THE FOCUS ON THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE FELTAS THOUGH THE LIST OF CHEMICALS THAT WE'VE ADDED THAT HAVE RAISED CONCERNS OTHER PLACES -- YOU KNOW ARE ARE WORTHY OF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE TNC -- BUT ONCE AGAIN THAT IT DOES NOT SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE KIND OF ROBUST ANNOUNCES THAT I THINK A LOT OF CONSUMERS EXPECTED THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH -- BUT IT DOES IT DOES GIVE. ITGIVES IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO TO DO THE INVESTIGATION -- THAT THEY WOULD FIND A SORRY IF THEY IF THEY FOUND IT NECESSARY THAT. OKAY YES CENTER SKINNER. OKAY. THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE BUT ADDING TO THE LIST BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT. AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE DTS SEE. TO BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ADDITIONAL PROCESS SEES. TO ADD AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS THAT NEW RESEARCH. COMES FORWARD ALL THE TIME NOW WHILE -- WHILE OUR GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE ROUNDUP WAS CONSIDERED VERY SAFE UP UNTIL MAYBE TWELVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN RESEARCH BEGAN TO SHOW -- A GOOD AMOUNT OF INDICATORS THAT OULD CAUSE PEOPLE TO REASSESS IT AND FURTHER MANY MORE STUDIES DUE TO OCCUR SINCE THAT TIME. SIMILARLY IF WE TAKE -- BPA WHILE WE OF WELL THERE'S BEEN A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ITS -- PROBLEMS OF LEACHING INTO FOOD FOR EXAMPLE IN IT AS FOR USE AS A HAND ALIGNING IN CANS. AND FOOD CANS AND IN BABY BOTTLES THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT. OUR THE RECEIPTS THAT COME OFF OF THE HEAT. BASICALLY WHEN USE YOUR CREDIT CARD NOW PRETTY MCH ALL RECEIPTS ARE PRODUCED THROUGH UP HE PROCESS AND THAT REQUIRES THE BPA AND WHAT IS NOW RESEARCH IS NO SHOWN. THAT THAT IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO YOUR SKIN THE LARGEST ORGAN OF YOUR BODY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IMPLICATIONS BUT FURTHER. FURTHER WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT THE BPA OFF THOSE RECEIPTS COMBINED WITH IF YOU USE HAND SANITIZER. EXACERBATES THE THE ARE HAZARDOUS -- IMPACTS OF THE BPA ON ON YOUR PHYSIOLOGY ANYWAY SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. ALRIGHT WE CAN'T EXPECT ONE A SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHENSIVELY STUDY. BUT IF THERE IS LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH -- THEN IT ALLOWS DTS SEE TO ELEVATE THAT PARTICULAR CHEMICAL AND BEGIN TO GO THROUGH THEIR PROCESS -- AND ALLOWS THEM TO RELY ON GOOD SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SO. I I THINK THE BILL IS GOING IN A VERY GOOD DIRECTION. I DO THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKE AS SOLID AS POSSIBLE THE ANY LANGUAGE THAT REFERENCES THE STUDIES WOULD RELY ON BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE STUDIES ARE VALID. SO AND I AM GOING TO TRUST THAT THE AUTHORS HEARD. BOTH THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS AND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE -- IN WITH THAT I WILL -- MOVED THE BILL. MEASURES BEEN MOVED. YOU MAY CLOSE SENATOR ALAN WHAT BRUSCHI THE QUESTIONS AND AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THE THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT. MY STAFF HAD WITH WITH SOME FOLKS WHO HAD CONCERNS WITH THE BILL YESTERDAY AND I ANTICIPATE THIS IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD IN A IN IN THE RENO WHEN THAT SPIRIT AND I THINK CON THAT THE REPORT THAT WE ALLUDED TO THE HEARING THAT WE TALKED. THAT WE ALL ATTENDED I RAISE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR CURRENT. GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS MEETING THE GOALS THAT WERE LAID OUT TEN YEARS AGO AND IN AB. EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND WE JUST TRY TO MEET THOSE GOALS WE'RE TRYING WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING. TO ADDRESS THE THE THE THE THE REASONS FOR THAT HAVING BEEN PASSED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT. THAT WORKS FOR CONSUMERS AND AND AND WHAT WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO TO GET THERE. AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECT AS FRONT OF A ASSISTANCE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER NINE SB THREE NINETY TWO MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BATES. HILL -- FILL AYE SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE STERN. STERN AYE STONE. NO NO Y. CASKEY HI MY CASKET I THAT. FIVE ONE IT IS NOT HERE WILL KEEP THE MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND LET'S CALLS. MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG UP THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN SB THREE THREE TWO AND I'LL RETURN THE GAVEL TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR A ABLE TEARING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS -- WILL TURN BACK TO OUR MAJORITY LEADER HOW WOULD HOW IS YOUR VOTES. THE GOVERNMENTS OF FINANCE CENTER DALY. I JUST WANT TO KNOW ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENCY IN THAT COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEIR PEAK -- THAT REPRESENTS LESS PEOPLE THAN VAN NUYS I REPRESENT VAN I SAY FIGURE WHAT THE HECK YEAH. THOUGH IN A LOW. EVERYONE WHO THE BETTER WE WILL GO OVER THE GASKETS THAT. WE MAY PERCEIVE THAT ON SB THREE THIRTY TWO THIS IS A SMALL SIMPLE BILL. YES MUCH OF THE BILL. SO IN YEARS AGO WHEN -- SENATOR BYRON SHEER WAS STAFFED BY SENATOR KIP LIPPER. THAT WE ALL KNOW. FARM THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD TO DEAL WITH ENERGY IN OTHER WORDS AS A POLICY MATTER. HOW DO WE START MOVING IN THE ENERGY FIELD WITHOUT PICKING WINNERS OR LOSERS BUT IS A STATE POLICY TO ADOPT A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT WAS 20%? NOW IT'S 2000% BUT THAT'S HOW POLITICS WORKS. AND SO IN THE FIELD OF WHAT HER WHICH IS AS IMPORTANT I WOULD ARGUE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS INSTEAD OF TREATING WATER AS WASTE ONE TIME USE? BUT TO LITERALLY CREATED OUR PS. FOR WATER IT'S VERY SIMILAR KIND OF DYNAMIC WE'RE SAYING BY JANUARY 1203050% OF THIS WATER GOING ARE THESE WASTE WATER FACILITIES HAS TO BE RECYCLED. NOW WHAT DOES THAT EAN WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS IN THE FEDERAL LAW. WE BASICALLY IN LARGE MEASURE IN THE AREA THAT I'M FROM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- STICK A STRONG THE CALLER RIVER WE STICK A STRAW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE USE THE WATER ONCE WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP TO FEDERAL STANDARDS BEFORE WE PUT IN THE OCEAN. AND THEN WE PUT IN THE OCEAN. WE PUT IN THE OCEAN LOS ANGELES. ALMOST AS MUCH WATER AS WE IMPORT. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET. WHY CAN'T WE TAKE THAT WATER THAT GOES TO THOSE FACILITIES IS ALREADY CLEANED UP AND RECYCLING THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES SAYS WITH A LARGE FACILITY IN LOS ANGELES HYPERION? HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. OKAY THAT'S GOOD. THERE'S A STATE POLICY WHY CAN'T WE BEGIN TO TREAT WATER IS A PRECIOUS RESOURCE. SUPPORT AND FIRST BECAUSE IT IS. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT WERE STEALING WATER FROM THE ENVIRONMENT IN MANY PLACES AND JUST DUMP IT IN THE OCEAN -- IN WE'RE DOING THAT POLITICALLY WORD THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE OR PISSED AT US. OFTEN BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN WATER AND DISRESPECTED PEOPLE FROM IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT ACOSTA COASTAL CENTER PISSED AT US. WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WE NEED TO TREAT WATER WITH GREAT RESPECT AND WE CAN DO IT THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO DO IT. THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT FORWARD TO IT. THERE'S OVER A MILLION AND A HALF ACRE FEET OF WATERTHE GUNS DUMPED IN THE ALL BILL OCEAN ANNUAL BASIS FROM THESE VARIOUS FACILITIES. AND WE CAN DRAMATICALLY SHIFT HOW WE DEAL WITH WATER POLICY SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS MEASURES JUST TAKE THAT FIRST STEP LIKE SENATOR. SHEERAN SENATOR LIPPER DID BACK THEN -- YOU KNOW AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO SET THESE STANDARDS. A IN IN TERMS OF THAT POCESS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL I DID A BILL A FEW YEARS AGO JUST TO GET READY TO AREA THAT SAID YOU COULDN'T PUT WATER IN THE OCEAN. I JUST DID IT ON PURPOSE TO MAKE A LOT OF NOISE AND NOW THIS YEAR IS SEPARATE WHERE I THINK IT REALLY MAKES SOME SENSE. AND I KNOW THAT THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL THOSE GREAT SOME-PROBLEMS FOR FOLKS. BUT IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE BATES. ARTICLE CASKEY SAID IT IS VERY SIMILAR. TO THE WAY WE HAD MANY YEARS AGO ON OUR PS AND SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS ON THIS SIZE ONE TO FRAME IT OUT FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU YES SENATOR HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TRACY CLAN I AM A LICENSED CIVIL ENGINEER AND CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR OF WATER EFFICIENCY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE IS CO SPONSOR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FROM SENATOR HERTZBERG AND SENATOR WIENER. EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA WE DUMP OVER ONE BILLION GALLONS OF TREATED WASTEWATER INTO OUR OCEANS AND BASS. WATER THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE PUT TO BENEFICIALLY USED IN OUR COMMUNITIES PROVIDING LOCAL RELIABILITY AND LOCAL JOBS. RECYCLING WATER THAT IS CURRENTLY WASTED COULD ALSO HELP OFFSET UNSUSTAINABLE DIVERSIONS FROM OUR RIVERS THAT THREATENED SALMON RUNS AND THOUSANDS OF FISHING JOBS. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE HOLD OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES TO THE GOALS WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA RECYCLED WATER POLICY. SO THAT WE CAN SUSTAIN THE LONGER AND MORE FREQUENT DROUGHTS WE WILL SEE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. OVER THE FALL AND RTC MET WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CASA AND WATER REUSE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CONCERNS WITH PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO SET REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RECYCLING OF OCEAN DISCHARGE. MY TO TAKE AWAYS FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WHERE THAT ANY FUTURE EFFORT SHOULD -- PUT RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET REQUIREMENTS -- ON BOTH WATER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION WILL REQUIRE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE THOSE FOLKS. AND SECOND THAT THERE SHOULD BE CREDITS FOR CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY. WITH THAT IN MIND WE WORKED WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG AND HIS STAFF AND FOCUSED ON AN APPROACH THAT ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS. SPECIFICALLY TO DO SO THE BILL WOULD OF BASS COMPLIANCE ON A REDUCTION OF EFFLUENT DISCHARGED AS OPPOSED TO A VOLUME OF WATER RECYCLED TOOK KNOWLEDGE THAT REDUCTIONS IN AFFLUENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY CONSERVATION. EFFICIENCY ONSITE REDUCE SEWER SCALPING WHERE YOU DIVERT WASTE WATER UP FROM A COLLECTION SYSTEM UPSTREAM OF A CENTRALIZED PLANT FOR USE AT A DISTRICT OR NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE. OR RECYCLING AT THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A PLANNING REPORTING BY WATER AND WE START AGENCIES TOGETHER AND PROVIDE FOR ENFORCEMENT AT ON BOTH TYPES OF AGENCIES. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BILL IS INTRODUCED REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK AND HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE INCLUDING CASA AQUA CMU WAY IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT THE CITY OF LA. AND OTHERS TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER DISCUSSION. THREES CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE FOUND THAT CLARIFICATION OF THE BILL'S INTENT. BUT YOU CAN SERVE OR REUSE THE WASTE WATER FLOWS WHILE ALLOWING AND PS PERMIT TO USE TO CONTINUE TO DISCHARGE SUFFICIENT VOLUMES. TO MEET THE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES IN THEIR PERMITS -- MAY GO A LONG WAY TOWARD EASING SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED. WE APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL BILL ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES. WE ASK THAT YOU PASS SB THREE THIRTY TWO OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE SO WE CONTINUE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE AUTHORS TO CONFESS TO ENSURE THAT BILL IS CLEAR ABOUT OUR INTENTIONS AND SET AMBITIOUS YET ACHIEVABLE GOALS THAT ALIGN WITH EXISTING STATE POLICY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES SIR WHEN CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SHAUN BOTTLE IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEPER LANCE -- HOURS ASIAN IS A REALLY LONG HISTORY ABOUT IT OVER DECADE HISTORY OF WORKING ON RECYCLED WATER ISSUES -- WE'VE BEEN ON EVERY ADVISORY PANEL THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH BY THE STATE WATER BOARD ON THE SECOND WATER POLICY FOR MONITORING FOR UC CONSTITUENTS EMERGING CONCERN -- WE'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE FOR EVERY MAJOR ROCK WATER CYCLING BILL THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND EVERY GENERAL PERMIT AT THE STATE WATER BOARD -- WE'VE BEEN THERE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ENSURE A WATER QUALITY WHILE PROMOTING OF RECYCLED WATER. AND SO NGUYEN THE BILL THAT CENTER HERTZBERG -- I MENTIONED EARLIER WAS WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE WERE ASKED -- INVITED DOWN IT'S ON CALIFORNIA TO TO TALK WITH -- FOLKS THAT HAD CONCERNS OVER WHAT THEIR ISSUES WERE WITH THIS BILL IT'S VERY SIMILAR -- AND IN WHAT WE HEARD WAS WE WE WANT TO GET THERE WE WANNA GET WHERE THE BILL'S GOING -- BUT WE NEED A BRIDGE TO GET THERE THAT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE REGULATIONS IN PLACE AND THIS BILL WOULD FORCE PURPLE PIPE TYPE PROJECTS AND TO BE HONEST THAT THAT. DID GIVE OUR ORGANIZATION CONCERNED WE DON'T WANNA BE FORCING PURPLE BY TECH PROJECTS. TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE WE ACTUALLY -- TEAMED UP WITH THE INDUSTRY WATER WE USE -- TO INTRODUCE AB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR BY QUIRK OTHER WAS PASSED REQUIRES THE WATER BOARD TO DO DRUG PORTABLE REDUCE REGULATIONS AND THAT IN OUR MIND IS THE BRIDGE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE ABLE. TO TO MAKE THIS BILL THESE ONES AND SHE THE GOALS THAT ARE ARE IN SB. THREE THREE TO US SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE STATE WATER BOARDS ALSO PASSED THE SURFACE WATER OR RESERVOIR WATER AUGMENTATION REGULATIONS TO ALLOW COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE A GROUNDWATER BASIN SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE -- TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT STORE THAT WATER IN IN A RESERVOIR RATHER THAN I'M NOT HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING GROUNDWATER BASIN. I THEN JUST LAST YEAR -- I ACTUALLY WENT TO A VERY SIMILAR PROCESS WITH WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS -- IS RECYCLED WATER POLICY WAS BEING REVISED I I I GOT INTO THE THE POLICY A STATEWIDE GOAL THAT WE RECYCLE ALL DRY WEATHER FLOWS. OF PROMOTION WAS WATER DISCHARGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE. HERE IN THIS BILL AND THE OPPOSITION AND THE CONCERNS THAT -- WE'RE HEARING NOW -- I HEARD LAST YEAR AND WE FOUND WAYS TO TO COME TO AGREEMENT AND AND AND COME NO COMPROMISE LANGUAGE IN THAT IN THAT POLICY LANGUAGE IT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR AND I'VE I'VE FAITHFUL THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME HERE AND WORK WITH -- THE FOLKS THAT DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT WE CAN DRESS THE MAKE THIS BILL FEASIBLE -- AND WE ASKED ABOUT THANK YOU. TURKISH OTTOMAN THE THOUGHT BECAUSE I I JUST WANT THE SPIRIT OF THIS DISCUSSION WHICH I I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS BEFORE THE ARMY PEOPLE COME UP HERE AND TELL ME. YOU KNOW SING SWISS CHEESE IS THAT IS THAT LOOK THIS IS THAT WE ARE WILLING WE WE GET THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES WE GET LIKE SAN DIEGO IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THE SAN FRANCISCO THE ONE SIZE. FITS ALL WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PAST DECEMBER THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ADOPTED RECYCLING WATER POLICY WE ARE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION THERE IS COMPLEXITY TO IT WE UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHERE WE ARE AS A POINT OUT THE ANALYSIS. IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF HOMEWORK THIS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO GET THIS THING RIGHT WE GET IT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DO WHAT. AND AS PEOPLE COME IN TO TALK ABOUT IT -- WE OUGHT WITH A STANDARD IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THAT HOMEWORK BUT IT REALLY IS I THINK ABOUT TAKING IN MAKING A REALLY STRONG STATEMENT AS A GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT HOMEWORK ON THE AND AND IT UP THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REINVENT OVER THE LAST NUMBER YEARS WITH THAT THE TERMINAL WATER COMMITTEE HERE OUR POLICY WITH. RECYCLING CONSERVATION DE SAO STORM WATER WATER MARKETS WATER QUALITY REALLY TRYING TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN THIS WHOLE WATER POLICY PIECE AND SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP IN THE LARGER MEASURES CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME AYE SUPPLEMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU. OKAY I OTHER FOLKS WANT TO WIN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. THREE SEPARATE VERGE ON HAVE SERIES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU BIGGER PLAYING CONSERVATION THE CAN SUPPORT. ANDREA OF INTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT -- ACOSTA WITH FRIENDS THE RIVER STRONG SUPPORT. MIKE MOLLY CAN BE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE BY CHRIS COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. ANALYSTS IMHO WITH KILL THE BAY AND SUPPORT. RUNNING ALSO IS HERE CLUB IN SUPPORT. NUMBER THE ONLY BOND VOLUNTEER FOR FRIENDS OF THE RIVER IN SUPPORT. THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES I'M ACTUALLY HERE AT NIGHT WIENER POSITION SO I HOPE IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- THE CITY SUPPORTS A STRONG LOCAL RECITE A RECYCLING GOALS AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CENTER HERTZBERG AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS AND OUR DC. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN FIND A PATH FORWARD ON THE BILL THAT WILL LINE AT LEAST COMMITMENT TO RECYCLE 1100% OF ITS WASTE WATER BY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WITH THE GOALS OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OF OPPOSITION TRUCKS ONE RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. HEARING AND SEEING NONE. GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THAN JUST COOK AUGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCY. AGENCIES HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION. TO SB THREE THIRTY TWO ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM THAT THE SENATOR SHOWING FOR WATER POLICY TODAY -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT BEFORE I GET AT TO STARTED HERE THAT THE THE BILL WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT GOALS UP HERE RIGHT NOW BUT THE BILL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS A MANDATE SO. THIS IS A MANDATED REDUCTION ON ALL A WASTE WATER DISCHARGERS BY A 50% REDUCTION BY TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN A 95% REDUCTION. BY TWENTY FORTY SO -- YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILLS WELL INTENDED BUT IN THE CURRENT FORM IS UNWORKABLE FOR MANY REASONS. THE VOLUME OF WATER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IMMENSE THIS IS NOT A SCENARIO THAT WOULD ALLOW AGENCIES TO BUILD OUT A FEW MORE PURPLE PIPE SYSTEMS. FOR LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION OR YOU KNOW OTHER ALLOWABLE USES THE VOLUME OF WATER WOULD NECESSARILY REQUIRE LARGE SCALE RECYCLING. AND MOVING MASS QUANTITIES OF WATER TO STORAGE FOR RE USE SO SING EITHER A GROUNDWATER APPLE FOR A RESERVOIR PIPING IT DIRECTLY INTO A DRINKING WATER SYSTEM -- KEY COMPONENTS OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THOSE TYPES OF STORAGE AND REDUCE OPTIONS ARE NOT YET IN PLACE AND THE WATER BOARD'S NOT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP. THE RAW WATER AUGMENTATION REGULATIONS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO DEADLINE A REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO DEVELOP THE TREATED DRINKING WATER AUGMENTATION RATE REGULATIONS. CALIFORNIA WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES ARE THE FOR FUN OF WATER RECYCLING ON THE WORLD WIDE SCALE AND MANY OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES ARE VOLUNTARILY DOING SOME OF THE MOST. PROGRESSIVE AN AMBITIOUS PROJECTS AND THE COUNTRY AND JUST TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL PROPOSAL IN PERSPECTIVE FOR A MOMENT. NONE OF THE PROJECT UNDER WAY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN AT THEIR FULL OPERATIONAL CAPACITY -- WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THE MANDATED REDUCTION SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT MANY OF THESE BIG PROJECTS AROUND TWENTY TO THIRTY YEAR PROJECT SCHEDULES AND WOULDN'T RECEIVE ANY CREDIT FOR THE PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY MADE BOTH FOR CONSERVATION AND FOR RECYCLING. THERE ARE VAST REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND HOW WATER IS MANAGED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BILL MAKES NO CONCESSIONS FOR AGENCIES THAT HAVE LEGITIMATE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. FOR RE USING THIS VOLUME OF WATER IN SOME PLACES THERE JUST IS NOT A STORAGE OPTION AND THE MANDATE WOULD MEAN. MOVING LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER FOR EXAMPLE OVER A MOUNTAIN RANGE TO SECURE ADEQUATE STORAGE THE GHG IMPACTS AND ENERGY DEMANDS FOR LARGE SCALE TREATMENT. AND TRANSPORT OF A WATER PROJECT LIKE THAT ARE CONSIDERABLE -- WASTEWATER DISCHARGES ARE ALSO NECESSARY FOR BRIAN MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND A CERTAIN VOLUME OF AFFLUENT LEVEL OF DILUTION IS REQUIRED BY THE WATER BOARD AN EPA. TO MANAGE THAT WASTE BYPRODUCT OF THE TREATMENT PROCESS AND IN MANY PLACES ESPECIALLY WIRE REGION'S THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE DEMAND OR MARKET FOR THIS MUCH ADDITIONAL WATER. PARTICULARLY DURING THE RAINY SEASON. THESE ARE JUST A SMALL SUBSET OF TECHNICAL ISSUES RAISED BY OUR MEMBER AGENCIES AND THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT VERY BY AGENCY AND BY REGION -- FINALLY WHAT THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ASIDE I WANT TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF COST AND AFFORDABILITY OF WATER SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR AGENCIES ARE ESTIMATING THAT THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ON AN AGENCY BY AGENCY BASIS. THE RESULTING RATE IMPACTS WOULD BE STAGGERING AGENCIES ARE TELLING US THEY BE LOOKING AT RATE INCREASES OF SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD. AND BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO ASSESS PROPORTIONAL UNFAIR FEES THOSE IMPACTS R. COSTA SYSTEM. AND INCLUDE ALL IMPACTED RATE PAYERS INCLUDING BUSINESSES AND DUSTY ON COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND INCLUDING EVEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE DON'T IS TO DISAGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS I THINK TO FIND A WAY TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OVER USE OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE BILL PROPOSES ACHIEVING THAT ANGLE IS PUNITIVE AND IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE TECHNICAL REALITIES AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN WATER MANAGEMENT. WE APPRECIATE THE TEARING COMMITTEE STAFFER HEARING OUR CONCERNS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND ALSO THE RECOMMENDATION AND THE ANALYSIS. TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- MOVING FORWARD WE THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO RE FRAME THIS LEGISLATION TO MOVE AWAY FROM SETTING MANDATED REDUCTIONS ON WASTEWATER DISCHARGES AND INSTEAD SHIFTING THE FOCUS TO MAXIMIZING BENEFICIAL REUSE. BY ADDRESSING EXISTING BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING THAT ANGLE SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR IN COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY FINDING A RESOLUTION FOR OUR CONCERNS [inaudible] IN CERTAIN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ASKING US ON BEHALF ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL ALTHOUGH WE DON'T THINK IT'S SWISS CHEESE NECESSARILY -- WE REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES MANY OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS -- ON ON PORTABLE AND NON POTABLE REUSE PROJECTS SO TO BE CLEAR WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF INCENTIVIZING THE BENEFICIAL USE OF RECYCLED WATER -- WHERE WE OPPOSED TO SB -- THREE THREE TWO IS DUE TO THE IMMENSE COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES IT WOULD CREATE FOR WATER SYSTEMS. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE COST A LACK OF AN APPROPRIATE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY AND A LACK OF FLEXIBILITY. AS MS GOVERNOR POINTED OUT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE BILL WOULD BE STAGGERING -- IN ORDER FOR WATER AGENCIES TO REDUCE DISCHARGES BY SUCH A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE IT WOULD REQUIRE THE CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE SCALE TREATMENT FACILITIES CONVEYANCE INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS BAND POTENTIALLY -- MANY MILES AND COULD TAKE DECADES TO COMPLETE. ARE THESE SIGNIFICANT COSTS WOULD HAVE TO BE SPREAD TO EXISTING RATE PAYERS PURSUANT TO PROP TO EIGHTEEN AS WE ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AFFORDABILITY OF WATER AS MISS GOVERNOR POINTED OUT WHICH AFFORDABILITY WATER WE KNOW IS A GREAT CONCERN OF OF THIS BODY -- IN ADDITION IN ORDER TO MEET THE DISCHARGE REDUCTION GOALS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL WATER PROVIDERS WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DEVELOP LARGE SCALE REVIEWS OF POTABLE REDUCE PROJECTS. SOME WATER PROVIDERS -- HAVE ALREADY TAKEN -- SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS THAT FOR NON POTABLE WATER -- AND SO THEY'RE REALLY LEFT TRYING TO MEET THIS GOAL I'M USING -- POSSIBLE SOURCES WERE CREATING PORTABLE SOURCES SO IN IN ORDER TO MEET THE MANDATE -- BECAUSE BY THIS THIS BILL WATER PROVIDERS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO LOOK TOWARDS -- NEW PORTABLE RE USE PROJECTS THAT ARE ARE VERY COMPLICATED -- TECHNICALLY VERY DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO IMPLEMENT -- IN AGAIN AS MISS GALLAGHER STATED THE STATE WATER BOARD WILL NOT ADOPT REGULATIONS REGARDING WHAT DRAW WATER AUGMENTATION UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE A YEAR AFTER THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO COMPLY -- AND THEN FINALLY FLEXIBILITY THIS BILL REALLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY -- FOR WATER AGENCIES TO PROPERLY MANAGE THEIR SYSTEMS -- AS YOU ALL KNOW EACH COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT HAS DIFFERENT WATER RESOURCES AND NEEDS AND THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY PRIORITIZE WATER REUSE PRODUCE PROJECTS. OVER OUR OTHER PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT THE REGION SUCH AS ADDITIONAL STORAGE -- SERVICE FIRST WATER STORAGE -- HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS -- SO THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY CONSIDER YOU KNOW EACH REGION INDEPENDENTLY OR THE IMPACT ON EACH WATER AGENCY. INDEPENDENTLY. AGAIN WE ARE SUPPORT OF ENCOURAGING ADDITIONAL RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS BUT IN A MANNER THAT -- LOOKS AT MORE REGIONAL BASIS AND CONSIDERS THE NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY. WE THINK THE SENATOR AND AND STAFF -- FOR THEIR TIME AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR CONSIDERATION OF OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES OTHER FOLKS ONE OF HIS CONCERNS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BEST A LOSS ON BEHALF OF WATER WE USE CALIFORNIA I'M AS WATER REDUCE WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RECYCLED WATER -- THAT'S OUR JOB -- WE ARE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION RECOGNIZING THAT -- WE ARE THE WATER RECYCLERS AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF RECYCLING WATER OUR BOARD ISN'T GOING UNDER A PROCESS TO COME UP WITH AMENDMENTS -- THEY ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT THESE ARE GOING TO BE AMENDMENTS NOT WEEKS -- WE WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO PROMOTE THE USE OF RECYCLED WATER AND AS MY COLLEAGUES NOTED THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO MOVING FORWARD -- WITH THE ON DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS I ALSO WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING NEW THERE IS. A LONG LONG WAIT THE WAITING LIST OF THE STATE BOARD FOR GRANTS AND LOANS -- I'M NOT JUST ASKING FOR GRANTS BUT AS OUR OF LOANS FOR RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- SO IT'S NOT THAT THE WILL IS THERE -- OUR AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO RECYCLE MORE WATER ANDUSE WATER BENEFICIALLY -- AND BECOME INDEPENDENT OF IMPORTED WATER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTH -- WE CAN WE CAN GET THERE WITH. INCENTIVES AND SUPPORT FROM THE STATE GETTING REGULATIONS ADOPTED -- AND FINDING SOME MORE FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD -- JUST WANT TO MAKE THOSE TWO QUICK NOTES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING OUT WITH THE SENATOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AS WE DEVELOP OUR AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE AND LOOK FORWARD. TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. MORNING ROUNDS ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION ALSO RESPECTFULLY. THANK. HOW ARE NOT TAKING TIME HERE TODAY FOR THE NORTH BAY WATER USE A THIRTY WHICH IS AN INDIE COMPRISED OF ELEVEN WATER AND WASTEWATER INTO THESE AND NAPA CINEMA IN MARIN COUNTIES -- BUT WE TRACK OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF CASA AND ALSO WATER REUSE WE WILL BE PLUGGED INTO THE DISCUSSIONS WITH RESPECT TO AMENDMENTS. BUT I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE POSTER CHILDREN FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES GIVEN THE NORTH COAST -- AREA THAT WE REPRESENTS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO YOUR HOMEWORK LIST FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO COME LEARN MORE ABOUT MORE ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. REMEMBERS THE CENTERS WITH THE WESTERN FIFTY TRUMP'S ASSOCIATION ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE WHOLE VISION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER -- WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY UP LATE POSITION LETTER BUT WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS WE ARE WASTE THAT DISTRICT PERMIT HOLDERS AND COMMERCIAL REPAIRS AS WELL SO THANK YOU -- MISTER TERRY MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- WE OPPOSE THE BILL BUT WE WE CERTAINLY. DO NOT OPPOSE THE IDEAS IN THE BILL WE WE APPRECIATE ORDER THE HERTZBERG A AN IDEA FORCING US ALL THE THINK BIG AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. THAT'S IMPORTANT I GOT A THUMBS TO HAVE THAT'S AWESOME ANYWAY THIS -- BUT IT AND WERE PRACTITIONERS OF WATER RECYCLING I MEAN ON AS A PC STAFF OUR WORLD EXPERTS -- AND THAT THAT'S A COMMITMENT -- BUT WITH WE THINK TO ACHIEVE WHAT THE CENTER AND THE PROPONENTS WANT TO ACHIEVE. IT REALLY REQUIRES VERY SERIOUS STUDIES ON FEASIBILITY AD COSTS IN ORDER TO HAVE. YOU KNOW -- AT PLANET WHAT CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR EACH REGION IN MANY CASES EACH DISTRICT TO COME ANYWHERE NEAR ACHIEVING THAT SO WE THINK MAYBE THE BILL WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE LOOKING LIKE THAT AND I DON'T MEAN. A STUDY BILL THAT GOES AWAY I MEAN A SERIOUS A BILL THAT REALLY ENABLES US TO DO SERIOUS STUDIES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO GET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS HERE. SO WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CENTER HIS STAFF AND THE SPONSORS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THANK YOU. STILL FIORINA. DANIEL LAST WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION A WE ACTUALLY REPRESENT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AND PUBLICLY ON ELECTRIC UTILITIES SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THAT IF THE ENERGY IMPACTS AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS. TO OUR AGENCIES SUCH AS AS OF PC AT LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE A CAST THAT AN AWKWARD REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON NOW ON THIS MOVING FORWARD BUT WE DO RESPECTFULLY. THE BILL AT THIS TIME -- MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTED THE SANTA CARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT ALSO KNOWN AS VALLEY WATER AND WE HAVE A AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR YOUR STAFF AND HIS STAFF TO WORK OUT THOSE ISSUES I THINK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLUGINS ALL OF US HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF CAME REAL AND ROSE WILL WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH AUCKLAND SEEM YOU A AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE GOOD SENATOR. WELL ANYWAY THIS WORKING HAN AUTUMN HARTMAN ON BEHALF OF IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT WE SHARE THE VERY STRONG CONCERNS OF BOTH COSTS AND WATER RE USE. WE INTEND TO WORK WITH AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS -- AS WELL AS WATER REVIEWS HOPEFULLY GETTING SOME WORKABLE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THAT IS ALL WE ONLY BE HALF OF MAY SO -- WATER WE ALSO OPPOSE LAST MINUTE AND SHARE THE CONTENT ALSO LIKE SAID THE RESULT OF OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING. AND EACH. HAS DIFFERENT CHALLENGES OF WATER GOES BACK IN THE RIVER NOT SOME LOSER IS THE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ON UP -- DISTRICT BY DISTRICT BASIS THANK YOU. OKAY OF THANK YOU. WELL THERE WE ARE OKAY THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE THE CAN BE LET ME ASK YOU THE FIRST QUESTION. MR MAJORITY LEADER ON REGIONAL DIFFERENCE ARE YOU HEARD THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- WE ARE A DIVERSE STATE FOR THE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCE [inaudible] HI MARK. LOS ANGELES COMMUNITIES VERY DIFFERENT IN THE NORTH COAST VERY FROM THE FROM THE DESERT. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR? ARE ARE YOU. TELL ME TELL ME HOW YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF THIS IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL -- YOU KNOW ANSWER TO A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT INVOLVES VERY DIFFERENT. GEOGRAPHIES AND AND WHAT IS THE GOAL A CHALLENGES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. YEAH I THINK IT'S REASONABLE AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH IT BUT THE ONLY HONEST EXPRESS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. IS THE COFFERS COMMON OPPOSITION WITH THE IS THIS A MASSIVE -- AMOUNT OF WATER THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOES THE OCEAN YEAH IT'S WE'LL FROM EVERYBODY ELSE'S DISTRICT WHAT'S THE IMPACT THERE'S A BUNCH OF STAKEHOLDERS LEARN HERE LIKE LET'S THINK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE WE HAD WE HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES OFTEN AND HE ARCHES OF ENVIRONMENTAL WATER WE ALSO HAVE IN TERMS OF THE THE BECAUSE THIS IS BIG PUZZLE WERE ALL KIND OF FITS TOGETHER BUT BE BE WITH WITH JUST I GET THE DIFFERENCES WAS? BACK LIKE YOU KNOW IF THAT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S A CONCERN THEN SHOULD WE HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THOSE AREAS THAT ARE IMPORTING ALL THAT WATER FROM OTHER PARTS THE STATE -- WOULD THAT BE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE SAME. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I DO THINK IT MERITS MERIT SOME SOME SOME HOMEWORK MIGHT MIGHT PLAY A BIGGER PART ABOUT THIS IS IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS THAT THE NATURE OF THIS PARTICULARLY IN HOW MUCH WATER IS WHEELED FROM ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WHAT YOU'RE MISSING WITH EVERY IS MISSING IN THE EQUATION THIS? YOU KEEP WILLING THAT WATER LEVEL AT ALL AS AN ACRE FOOT FOR METROPOLITAN WATER LA STEAL IT FROM THE COLOR RIVER WELL IF YOU CAN RECYCLE WATER THAT ELEVEN DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT THAT WATERS RESOLD. IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DIAGNOSTIC IN THAT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU IN THAT THOUGHT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE I WAS IS SUGGEST IN THE ANALYSIS TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT YOU KNOW I GOTTA TELL YOU THIS IS LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN THE SKY IS FALLING NOTHING WILL EVER BE MET THE ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE STANDARDS OF WHY YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING AND WE HAD AND THEN BEFORE THE DEADLINE EVERYBODY WAS BRIGHT AND HOW THEY EXCEEDED THEIR NUMBERS RIGHT YES THERE'S DIFFERENCES YESTERDAY AFFLUENT NUMBERS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE. AND HOW MUCH IS IT'S A 20% BOGEY RIGHT SO. I UNDERSTAND AND I DO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A MANDATE -- IN WHATEVER IT IS WHAT WITH THE WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT FACTORS YOU COULD PATIENTS AT THIS IS SECOND IN TERMS THE LARGER ISSUE. BUT I THINK THAT YOU WOULD WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE THE LARGER KIND OF SUSTAINABLE APPROACH THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. ARE A IN WATER POLICY AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFERENCES AND IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I AGREE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH WHAT. THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO IN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ORANGE COUNTY'S THE PLATINUM. STANDARD IN TERMS OF RECYCLING HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET NOW THE RATS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. BUT BUT HAT BEING SAID -- I THINK WE'RE GETTING EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION IN THIS HERTZBERG AN APPROACH TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SET THOSE STANDARDS IN A WAY THAT THAT IT WORKS. AND THE IS RESPECTABLE TO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND HAS THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OUT OF TREES YOU WOULD HAVE SOMETHING. TO THIS. I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YEAH YOU KNOW WE AT THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IS AN AREA WHERE WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS. I THINK WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW ANYTIME THAT YOU'RE REMOVING WATER FROM THE ENVIRONMENT -- YOU KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH THE AT TAMI THERE YOU KNOW WANTING MORE MORE WATER FROM THAT AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE THOSE ISSUES AND WE JUST WANT TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO THEM -- OBVIOUSLY IMPORTED WATER IS A MORE OBVIOUS CASE WHERE RECYCLED WATER AND IMPORTED OR COST COMPETITIVE AND YOU KNOW -- AND RECYCLE WATER HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF LOWER LIABILITY AND NO BUT IF DROUGHT PROOF -- QUALITY SO -- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT I MEAN WE'RE EXPLORING THOSE AND AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT. WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THIS FITS ON THE THE BIG THINK SPECTRUM? I HOW HOW WOULD YOU RATE IT. AS A HERTZBERG IN THAT I KNOW OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME PROBABLY STAB ME IN THE BACK OF I MENTIONED TAX REFORM BUT OR A FEW OTHER ONES FROM HIM SELECT YOUR CONTACTS BUT IT'S IT'S SUPPORT WORK AS WATER STUFF FOR FORTY SOME YEARS AND IT'S THE IT'S IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL LIVE WITHOUT LIKE ELECTRICITY WE CAN LIVE WITH A LOT OF STUFF. WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT WATER AND AND WHAT I LEARNED IN THIS PROCESS IS IN IN ALL OF THIS WATER WORLD THAT WE WORK IN THE FOUL THOUSAND PLUS WATER AGENCIES AND ALL THE POLITICS AND IT. IS JUST WATER POLICIES ONE LOSERS JUST TKES SO MANY DECADES TO STEP TO MOVE THE SHIP. AND YOU YOU YOU YOU. AND GIVEN WHERE WE ARE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT AT TATIAN THAT. THE EMERITUS CHAIRMAN OVER HERE TALKS ABOUT A LOT AND AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND YOU SEE THE SNOW PACK AND ALL THESE THINGS WE'VE GOT TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW WE RETHINK THIS STUFF. AND CERTAINLY JUST THINKING ABOUT RECYCLING WATER THAT WERE ALREADY USING AND PAYING TO PROCESS AND WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP TO GO IN THE OCEAN SEEMS TO ME TO BE A PRETTY. THOUGHTFUL STARTING POINT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND WATER POLICY GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU -- MANAGEMENT CENTER HELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND THANK YOU SENATORS BURFORD FOR BRINGING THIS CONVERSATION THAT I THINK IS IS. IS TIMELY NECESSARY AND AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA -- BUT I YOU KNOW AND AND THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT ANALYSIS -- I THINK IT REALLY. HIGHLIGHTS THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY IN TRYING. TO AND THE FACT THAT THE AMENDMENTS THE THERE AREN'T MANY AS AMENDMENTS BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE I THINK TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE OPPOSITION AND HOW WE CAN KIND OF CRAFT THAT IN A WAY THAT. THAT THAT WORKS IN AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT TODAY SITTING HERE BUT I I'M I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TO TO SUPPORT. THE IDEA THAT WE KEEP IT MOVING AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS I I WOULD HOPE THAT IT COULD BE DONE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I DON'T KNOW -- BECAUSE SOME OF THE MANDATES OF THE I MEAN SOME OF THESE THINGS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK INTO -- THE REQUIREMENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE OUT TILL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THERE AREN'T -- WORKABLE -- AT THIS POINT AND HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED AND DESIGNED AND CRAFTED IN A WAY -- THAT I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO VOTE FOR TO AND AT THAT THE NEXT -- OPPORTUNITY BUT I I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S A TOUGH OF IT'S A TOUGH ORDER BUT I IF YOU THE GOALS ARE THERE WE NEED TO MEET UP AND WE NEED TO GET THEIR TO HOW WE DO IT. HOW WE DO IT IN A MANDATED WAY THAT'S NOT? GOING TO BE SO ONEROUS AND AND COSTLY FREIGHT FOR FOR EVERYONE. THE HAPPY TO HELP THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATED NIGHT. I COMMITTEE UPPER LEVEL GRAYSON THIS THING TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE BUT WE GOT EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM NOW AND SO IT'S THE FIRST STEP -- HOW WE LOOK AT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF EXAMPLES OF OF THE LEGISLATURE SETTING -- MEMBERS JUST GOALS -- THERE OF COURSE HAS TO BE THIS AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PUSH PULL BETWEEN. THE POSSIBLE AND THE AND AND AND THE NECESSARY -- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS VERY STRONG PUSH BACK FROM THE AGENCIES THAT WOULD BE TASKED WITH DOING THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NATURAL TO SOME EXTENT BUT THEN BUT THERE THERE ARE GONNA BE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOGISTICS OF THIS AND AND YOU KNOW. WHERE THIS AUDIT FIT ON TO THE LIST OF PRIORITIES OF OF WITH IT IF IT IS GOING TO INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT REPAIR COSTS? HI AND AND AND YOU KNOW I KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO AS WELL -- SO. I'M OF THE BILL THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT YOU KNOW. AN IMMENSELY IMPORTANT GOAL AND AND YOU DO [inaudible] REYES. FAIR POINTED I'M WE'RE BOTH REPRESENT LOS ANGELES AT ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE REALLY OUGHT TO GET MORE MORE. SELF SUSTAINING UC SANTA MONICA I KNOW IS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IT'S KIND OF VERY. VERY WELL ALONG THE WAY TOWARD A SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW. SMALL IT IS -- SO. I WILL CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND YOU KNOW IN IN IN IN. GREAT DIFFERENCE TO YOUR TO YOUR OF YOUR AMBITIOUS GOALS HERE IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CINEMA CASKEY -- SEE NO OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE CENTER YEAH I JUST ONE OF THE JUST MAKE THE FINAL POINT ABOUT COST YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IS THERE'S PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE A REVENUE STREAM I YOU WATER. AND YOU CAN RESELL IT. THEY'RE EITHER WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE A PRICE SIGNALS LOVING HER DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT. YOU HAVE GREAT ON THIS THIS THAT THAT WILL FIGHT I AM TOTALLY SENSITIVE THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN SOME OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES AS WE SHOULD CENTER HILL RAISED ON TIMING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THE COST THING IS TO ME IS NOT A GIGANTIC PROB PROBLEM IT BOTH IN THE RESPECT THAT THERE'S A REVENUE STREAM NUMBER. ONE AND TWO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN YOU WORK ON THESE BIG PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS -- ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR COMES BACK IN THE FORM PAYROLL TAXES SALES TAX AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS SO. WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THESE BIG CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT ARE NECESSARY? FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE IMPACT ON THE ACTUAL GOVERNMENT IS IS REALLY MINIMAL NUMBER ONE AND TWO IF WE DON'T PASS. THE TAX REFORM WE HAVE MORE VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD AND DURING THE DOWN TERMS OF VOLATILITY LIKE WHAT WE DID WITH OUR BIG GIGANTIC HAIRY AUDACIOUS IDEA ON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. DOES CONSTRUCTION JOBS HAD A GIGANTIC IMPACT IN MITIGATING SOME OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY SO THESE STEPS WHEN YOU DO THE DIAGNOSTIC IN THE LARGER THINK ABOUT THIS IS A LOT MORE ELEMENTS TO IT BUT THE FINANCE PIECE IN THE CROSSPIECE TO ME. ARM AS WE FACE THIS GOING FORWARD DEALING THE ANALYSIS IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST AREAS THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES ARE IF WE HAVE TO A BOND ISSUE MAYBE IN LIEU OF THAT. A HIGHER EDUCATION BOND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD THING JOB JUST JOKING OF COURSE. WAS IT WAS A TOUGH TWISTED IN THE AMOUNT I THINK I'M A JOINT AUTHOR THAT. HIGHER EDUCATION BUT NEVER THE LESS OUT OF DEFERENCE AND RESPECT AND COURTESY TO YOU AND YOUR AT YOUR YOUR YOUR LONG STANDING EXPERIENCE IN THIS BUILDING I WILL THAT. SUPPORT THIS BILL TO MOVE BY CENTER WOULD CASKEY -- SIX OF THESE KALRA. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB THREE THREE TO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALAN HI BETH. PHIL. HILL AYE SKINNER [inaudible] STERN [inaudible] STONE. STONE NO MY CASKEY BY MAKOVSKY AYE. OKAY THIRTY WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF FOR APPS MEMBERS TO ADD ON APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. JERRY LEADER -- LET'S PASSED THE THE GAVEL AGAIN TORTURE EMERITUS IN I WILL NOW PRESENT -- I THINK THE TWO FINAL ITEMS. SB FIVE TWENTY SIX SB. SIX EIGHTY TWO MEMBERS THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN IN TODAY'S AGENDA THIS IS THE STATE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. THERE. ARE SUCH AS THIS NUMBER WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU THE CARD -- PRESENTLY I LET I LET YOU LIKE IT THIS WAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- TO THE MIX IT UP. THIRTY ONE INTERSPERSED WITH HERTZ BURKE. OKAY I HAVE SOME MEMBERS SOME -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS COMMITTEE SURELY KNOWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS. PRO TEM STEINBERG'S BILL THAT SOUGHT TO LINK OUR TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND HOUSING EFFORTS. WITH OUR GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THE STATE OF ALL COMMUNITIES BILL. THE LAW REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO SET REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS FOR THE STATE'S EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN. PLANNING ORGANIZATION STUDIES NPOS THEN CREATE A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY AS PART OF THEIR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THAT IF IMPLEMENTED WOULD ALLOW THE REGION TO MEET. THE REDUCTION TARGETS NOW 201-7 WE PASSED SB. ONE FIFTY WHICH ASK CARB TWO WOULD ASSESS THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE TOWARD MEETING THE REDUCTION TARGETS IN AND THE CARD HAS AS DEAD AN ASSESSMENT. AND THEY BASICALLY COUNTY CALVIN IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS EXPECTED. UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IN THE NOTED CONCERNS ALL QUOTE -- THE CONTINUED PERVASIVE AND LONG STANDING DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE FACTORS THAT SHAPE REGIONAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA. SO JUST TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT REGULATORY HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE LOCAL REGIONAL STATE LEVELS. AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY CLIMATE HEALTH ECONOMIC AND HOUSING GOALS THERE IS A CONTINUING DISCONNECTED. CERTAINLY SOMETHINGTHAT NOBODY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS NOT UNFAMILIAR WITH. IT IS UNFAMILIAR WITH THEM. I BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT. THIS BILL BASICALLY TAKES THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND AND AND TRIES TO IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS ONE ESTABLISHING A MEDICAL BILL THE ACTION PLAN FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS A TASK FORCES CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES TO GET A SEAT ON TRACK. TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE SECTORS. AND OUR A ES IN SO DOING CREATES A PROCESS TO COLLECT THE NECESSARY DATA THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE. THE PROGRESS THAT REGION'S ARE MAKING. NOW IF BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX CARB FINDS THAT OUR REGION IS STILL NOT MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING ITS D. G. A. G. H. T. TARGETS. THE STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PLAN GUIDELINES WOULD GIVE HIGHER PRIORITY FOR STATE FUNDING. TO PROJECTS IN THAT REGION THAT REDUCE. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND GHG EMISSIONS. MEMBERS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO HOW COMMUNITIES AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE PLANNED CALIFORNIA WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. REDUCTIONS TO MEET OUR GOALS FOR TWENTY THIRTY LET ALONE TWENTY FORTY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. DURING A PREVIOUS HEARING -- AND THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH. WRITTEN IN THAT AT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE CONCERNS REYES THAT HEARING TRANSPORTATION AS WE KNOW IT COUNTS 440% OF OUR MISSIONS. IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE TODAY ON WHERE. TO PUT LOCAL NEW COMMUNITIES AND HOW MUCH SPRAWL -- IS ACCEPTABLE REMAIN WILL REMAIN WITH US FOR DECADES. ESPECIALLY NOW WE WORK SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'VE GOT TO BE DELIBERATE IN ARE PLANNING TO ENSURE THAT WE BOTH MEET OUR HOUSING. IN OUR CLIMATE GOALS WHEN THEY WERE BUILDING SAFE LIVABLE COMMUNITIES THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT REALLY DO PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. SO SB THREE THIRTY FIVE GAVE US THE FRAMEWORK MORE THAN A DECADE AGO NOW WE NEED TO GIVE IT SOME. SOME SOME TEETH WE NEED TO GIVE IT SOME STRENGTH WE NEED TO BUILD UPON THAT FRAMEWORK TO MAKE IT WORK AND I HAVE WOULD BE. THE CARD A RIBBON FROM AN RTC JOSH START FROM TRANSFORM WILL BEAR IT FROM THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THERE ARE GOING TO BE HERE. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SWEETNESS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS CARTER EVEN WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M HERE TODAY TO REALLY REITERATE -- EVERYTHING SENATOR ALLEN SAID AND EXPRESS ENERGY SEES STRONG SUPPORT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORT TO HALT CLIMATE CHANGE. EXTENDS TO OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH POOR AIR QUALITY. AND DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AN UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT POURS MORE FUEL ON THAT FIRE. OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES OF RAISE THE ALARM THAT OUR CURRENT. TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AND PRIORITIES ARE PUSHING MORE ROADS AND WIDER ROADS. AND EXPERTS AND OUR LIVED EXPERIENCE TELL US THAT THAT IS -- SIMPLY ENCOURAGING MORE AND MORE DRIVING. SB FIVE TWENTY SIX BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND ONE FIFTY TO RECOGNIZE THE FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS. IN CALIFORNIANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET AROUND WITHOUT GETTING IN THEIR CAR SOMETHING THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SEEKING MORE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO. THANKS TO SB ONE FIFTY THE TERRORIST RESOURCES BOARD PRODUCED THIS FIRST COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN OUR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CLIMATE GOALS. AND PRODUCE SOME PRETTY STARTLING FINDINGS THAT SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX SIX TO REDRESS. WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS EXPECTED FROM SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IS NECESSARY TO HIT OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND ELECTRIFICATION IT WILL NOT GET US THERE ALONE. YET PASSENGER VEHICLE EMISSIONS ARE CLIMBING. THE PORTION OF COMMUTERS DRIVING ALONE TO WORK IS RISING IN ALMOST EVERY REGION. AND CALIFORNIA'S STAND TO SPEND A TRILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF CURRENT TRANSPORTATION PLANS BUT THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS. OR STATE PRIORITIES ON EQUITABLE GROWTH AND OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION. TO SECURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION CHOICES ENVISIONED BY SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA REMAINS ON TRACK TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE NEED SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX HELP US GET THERE. LOW REDUCE CLIMATE POLLUTION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE SECTOR. HELP US ACHIEVE OUR STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS THREE THANK SENATOR ALAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANKS. THANK YOU CENTERS JOSH WAS STARK WITH TRANSFORM -- HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB -- FIVE TWENTY SIX SB FIVE TWENTY SIX IS THE NEEDED AND REASONABLE NEXT STEP IN CALIFORNIA'S DECADES LONG WORK TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE QUITE FRANKLY -- THE MEMBERS -- IN ON THE COMMITTEE HERE THE MEMBER PRESENT TODAY -- IN PARTICULAR. THIS ORDER THE GROUPS HAVE TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE OVER A WIDE VARIETY OF TOUGH ISSUES AND HAVE MOVED US IN SUCH A WAY. THAT WE'RE OFTEN LOOKED AT AS A WORLD LEADER OR THE WORLD LEADER IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE BOTH IN ITS IMPACTS AND OUR CLIMATE POLLUTION. THAT'S OFTEN PERCEIVE THE CLASS CALIFORNIA JUST NATURALLY SHOULD TAKE THAT THAT ROLE AND LEADERSHIP BUT I THINK WE HEAR RECOGNIZE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S KINDA LIKE A DUCK ON THE WATER RIGHT SERENE ON TOP AND PADDLING LIKE HELL UNDERNEATH. TO TO GET THINGS DONE RIGHT AND AND IT HAS REQUIRED SOME REALLY BOLD STEPS -- AND YOU ALL HAVE TAKEN OUT ON YOU ALL HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S MET ITS TWENTY TWENTY GOALS EARLY CORRECT -- SO DECADE OR SO INTO A BILL INTO SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU ALL PASSED SENATOR ALLEN SB -- ONE FIFTY TO CHECK IN ON KHN TO SEE IF CALIFORNIA'S REGIONS ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THEIR SHARE OF OF GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. WE RELIED UPON SCIENCE TO CONCLUDE THAT ANTHROPOMORPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL WE RELIED UPON SCIENCE TO ADDRESS -- EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN OTHER PLACES AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO RELY UPON SCIENCE. HERE AND WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS VERY CLEARLY IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF CAR TRAVEL WE DO IN CALIFORNIA IS UNSUSTAINABLE TO OUR CLIMATE INTO THAT THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA FRANKLY -- AND SO WE NEED TO START MAKING THOSE CHANGES THE SCIENCE ALSO CLEARLY SHOWS THAT. CURRENT EFFORTS HAVE NOT MOVED THE NEEDLE -- TO ADDRESS THOSE AND THOSE CHANGES ARE NOT CHANGES THEIR THEIR CHANGES THAT ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED AND AND APPRECIATED AND LOVED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGES LIKE IMPROVEMENTS ARE OUR NEW TRANSIT PROJECTS. MORE BUS STOPS MORE TRANSIT SERVICE MORE BIKING AND WALKING OPPORTUNITIES SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS. TO GET WHERE THEY NEED TO GO -- SO TRANSFORM SPORTS THIS THIS BILL SB FIVE TWENTY SIX AS THIS REAL REASONABLE EFFORT. ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE MAYBE TEN MORE YEARS RIGHT OUR ELEVEN MORE YEARS TO MEET OUR NEXT SET OF GOALS -- IF WE WERE TO WAIT FIVE MORE YEARS BEFORE WE STARTED ADDRESSING THIS WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE NATURE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS SUCH THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE IN FOUR YEARS OR FIVE YEARS. YOU HAVE TO START PLANNING AND MOVING NOW SO WE'RE GIVING A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WE'VE TAKEN A REASONABLE DOUBT ON TIME A DECADE. IN ORDER TO DO A REAL REPORT ON ON A FRONTRUNNER -- ASKING FOR A REAL REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME ANOTHER DECADE -- IN ORDER TO BEGIN MAKING THESE CHANGES BUT WE'VE NOTICED IN THE FIRST DECADE. THAT THOSE CHANGES WERE NOT MADE. THEY JUST WEREN'T MADE SO SB FIVE TWENTY SIX I THINK BEGINS IS VERY BOLD AND TOUGH CONVERSATION OVER REALLY WHAT IS CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE BLIND SPOT. AND THAT'S ITS TRANSFER STATION TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THAT SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX LOW -- WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION OF THE THIRD CO SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA IS STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF SB.

REDUCTIONS IN CHRONIC ILLNESS -- IMPROVEMENTS IN AIR QUALITY. PRODUCTIONS IN CANCER RATES -- MENTAL ILLNESS -- BENEFITS OF THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH BENEFITS TO IMPLEMENTING SB THREE SEVEN FIVE SUCCESSFULLY THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO TROUBLED BY THE FINDINGS IN THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT SHOWING THAT WE'RE NOT ON TRACK. THIS LEGISLATION REALLY MOVES US FORWARD TO GET US BACK ON TRACK MAKE SURE THAT WORD ACHIEVING THOSE BENEFITS OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES.

ANY TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS -- LET ALONE THOSE THAT ARE EQUITABLE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE -- SO WE SEE SB FIVE TWENTY SIX IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- A DECADE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO RAMP UP OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THE NPOS ARE DIRECTLY SUFFICIENTLY -- FUNDING AND DIRECTING FUNDING TOWARDS -- TRANSIT BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND NONTRADITIONAL TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS LAKE SAMPUL THAT WORK FOR LOW INCOME RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL -- AND REDUCE VMT -- IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALIGN STATE FUNDING AND INVESTMENTS TO MATCH OUR STATE CLIMB INEQUITY GOALS -- AND WE SEE THIS BILL IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY STRENGTHEN THE TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RTP SCS PROCESS -- AND TRULY MEANINGFUL INCLUDE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE PLANNING --SIR VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL AND INSURING THAT -- EQUITY IS REALLY CENTERED THANK YOU.

BOTH OF THOSE AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. AIR QUALITY BILLS OF THIS SESSION IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT. HER NUMBER IS THE KEY TO CREDIT WITH AN RTC BUT REGISTERED SUPPORT FOR THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION AND THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY THINK. AND ALSO SIERRA CLUB IN SUPPORT OF JIM LIMBURG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. DAVE SNYDER CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT. HELLO WISEMAN CLIMATE PLAN AND NETWORK OF MORE THAN FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE IN SUPPORT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS OF THE BILL MOVES TOWARD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS O'DONNELL OPPOSITION. IS THERE OPERATE IS REPETITION -- TO FIVE TO SIX WELL I'VE NOTIFIED STEPPED UP THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT IS OPPOSED NOW -- BEFORE I SUBMIT IT BUT I'D HI I WANNA PUT IT IT'S THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL COMMITTEE SO I WANT TO PUT THIS IDEA IN FRONT. OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH [inaudible] IT IT [inaudible] FOCUSES. ON AT THE REGION'S BUT THE QUOTE THAT THE SENATOR READ AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SAID THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL CHANGE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE [inaudible] WHAT IF? THE HOUSING GOAL OF BUILDING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOUSING UNITS IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS MEANS THAT WORKERS HAVE TO BUILD TOO MANY HOUSING UNITS. IN PLACES WHERE ARE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY SAY THEY SHOULDN'T GO BECAUSE WE NEED BIGGER SEWER PIPES IN THE INFILL AREAS BUT WE NEED TO HOUSE PEOPLE AST. AND WHAT IF THE REASON A REGION DOESN'T MAKE ITS GOAL IS BECAUSE HOUSING IS LEAKING TOO MUCH TO THE SUBURBS BECAUSE OF THAT POLICY PRESSURE. THAT'S A PROBLEM PHÃN DECK THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS RECENTLY LOOKED AT PRICING AS A MEANS. TO CONSOLIDATE AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL AND WHEN THEY RAN THEIR PRICING NUMBERS THROUGH THE TITLE SIX ANALYSIS THEY FOUND THAT THE PRICING WAS UNFAIR TO COMMUNITIES OF EQUITY. THESE ARE GNARLY PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE. IN THE US BE ONE FIFTY REPORT SAYS. NPOS ONLY CONTROL 10% OF THE MONEY THAT THE PROGRAMMING YET YOU'RE GOING TO HLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN THE STRUCTURE FOR THE INTERESTINGLY THE SP ONE FIFTY REPORT. OMITS ANY MENTION OF THE 6% GAP BETWEEN THE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE TARGETS AND THE SCOPING PLAN GOAL. THIS IS A A IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL STATE ACTION. THERE IS NO FOCUSING FIVE TWENTY SIX ON THIS POINT IT IS ALL ABOUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MILES TRAVELED IN A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR THE VERY GOOD POLICY REASONS THAT ALTHOUGH SUPPORTERS MENTIONED LET'S HELP THE WHOLE LIST TO CONVERSATION. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. AND I'LL PUT A CHALLENGE OUT. ABOUT A POLICY ISSUE THAT'S OUT THERE THAT YOU COULD TAKE. CREDIT FOR RIGHT AWAY. YOU THE STATE COULD REENACT THE FIFTY FIVE MILE AN HOUR SPEED LIMIT AND SAVE SO MUCH FUEL THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY ACCOUNT 425% OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE THREE SEVENTY FIVE TARGETS. AND THE 25% DIEM THI REDUCTION GOAL THAT'S IN THE SCOPING PLANT. INTO THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST IN THE CUMULATIVE -- REDUCTIONS WOULD BE THERE THAT'S A TOUGH POLITICAL CHOICE BEFORE GOING TO HAVE THESE NORMALLY PROGRAMS LET'S HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF SINGLING OUT REGION'S THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. THE CONTROL AS IS REPEATED IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT. TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTING FOR IN THERE ARE ON TRACK TO TERMINATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR ON THIS WE WORKED TOGETHER A ONE FIFTY AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME REAL ISSUES TO WRESTLE WITH. GIVE. NECKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WHERE A TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY THE BOARD TOOK A POSITION -- OF OPPOSE LAST WEEK AND WE APOLOGIZE THAT WAS -- AFTER YOUR DEADLINE SO -- BUT WE HAVE HAD SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL ONES I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TWO POINTS IF I COULD -- THE FIRST AS MISTER HAGENS ALLUDED TO WEAR TRANSPORTATION AGENCY -- THE BILL HAS A LOT OF ALL GOAL THAT WE COMPLETELY APPRECIATE WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS ARE LINKED TO TO SMART REGIONAL PLANNING. BUT WE DO TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL. OVER LAND USE DECISIONS ANY MORE THAN THE SCHOOL BOARD DOES ABOUT WHERE SCHOOL IS LOCATED AND YOU MIGHT BE FRUSTRATED THAT'S GONNA BE LOCATED IN A IN A SUBURBAN AREA. BUT WE AS A TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE ALL OF THE CONSTITUENTS WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY. AND PROVIDE THEM CONGESTION RELIEF AND MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS WHICH WE THINK WE DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE LAND USE PLANNING AND SO THE TEETH AT THIS. BILL -- INCLUDES IS ARE ENTIRELY DIRECTED AT TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THAT HAVE NO CONTROL OVER A LAND USE DECISIONS. AND THEN SECONDLY -- IN A MORE TECHNICAL WAY -- I'D LIKE TO JUST RAISE THE ISSUE OF V. M. T. -- WE DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT BAROMETER OF GHG REDUCTIONS -- FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE VERY PROUD OF A PROJECT IN AN ORANGE COUNTY CALLED THE OC STREET CARTS JUST GETTING OFF THE GROUND AS WELL JUST IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION. IT IS A BRAND NEW TRANSIT SYSTEM NOBODY ELSE IS BUILDING TRENT NEW TRANSIT SYSTEMS THIS IS AN EXPANSION ONE THIS IS A BRAND NEW ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY TO SERVE. ONE OF THE DENSEST AREAS OF I'M NOT ONLY ORANGE COUNTY BUT THE NATION AND SANTA ANA WE'RE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF IT WE'VE COBBLE TOGETHER FUNDS THROUGHOUT -- LOCAL MEASURE MONEY STATE DOLLARS AND FEDERAL DOLLARS. BUT THIS PROJECT IRONICALLY AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NARROW DEFINITION OF THE M. T. FROM ANY AYE OUR PERSPECTIVE. INCREASES -- VMT. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RE ROUTE TRAFFIC WE HAVE AN WE HAVE A COMMUTERS THAT -- GO TO THE END POINTS AND SO ON A VERY NARROW DEFINITION IT DOES INCREASE THE M. T. BUT IT ABSOLUTELY REDUCES GHG AND AND I THINK IT'S THE EXACT PROJECT TYPE OF PROJECT -- THAT THIS BODY HAS TALKED ABOUT -- REALLY SUPPORTING AND WANTING TO I EMPHASIZE IN TERMS OF AN INCREASE TRANSIT SO AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HAD INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AS WE DID ALSO ON SB -- ONE FIFTY IT'S WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE THESE TOUGH ISSUES. TOO BIG TO FAIL NO -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OF SB. FIVE TWENTY SIX RIGHT LET'S CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK. TO THE DAIS. WHAT'S THE AUTHOR -- THE OPPOSITION HAS FOLK FOCUS AND SAME RESULT I KNOW IF WE CAN GET. RICHARD NIXON BACK TO SIGN A FIFTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR. YEAH ACTUALLY WE STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY. UNDER THE FACT THAT -- TO NARROW NOT ENOUGH IN. IN TOO MUCH FOCUS ON VMT. OUR WELL LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS AND PACK AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE JUST GOTTEN A MEETING OF THE CALIPHATE TWO PM -- TODAY -- FOR FOR FOLKS TO TALK SHOP ABOUT. THE NOT YOUROKAY WILL BE SUPPOSEDLY -- WILL WILL WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN -- TO TO TO START WORK ON SOME OF THE THINGS I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE THE THE COMMENTS AND I THINK IT IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH WE'RE ALL. OF MOVING IN THE SAME CONCEPTUAL DIRECTION THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CRAFT THIS IN A WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY. YOU GIVE SOME TEETH THAT DESERVE SOME STRENGTH OF THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND IF IT IF IT TAKES UP MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH -- TO THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMPONENTS. FOR VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION SIMILARLY I MEAN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AN IMPORTANT. FACTOR BUT I OBSOLETE GREED THAT IT'S NOT. THE ONLY FACTOR -- WITH AGGRESSIVE GIGI FOR CERTAIN I MEAN IT IT DOES HI DID RELEASE A CONGESTION AND OTHER KIND OF IMPORTANT GOALS THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO REACH IT IS WE TRY TO CREATED A LIVABLE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- DID BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR AND IN FACT AND IN THE OF FOR THE IN THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE REALLY. REALLY GOOD TRANSIT -- YEAH V. M. T. IT CAN TAKES ON A WHOLE NOTHER. IT'S IT'S NOT NOT NOT AS BIG A PROBLEM SO I'M TOLD. LET LETS THE DAN -- THIS AFTERNOON AND AND AND AND IN THE FUTURE AND AND AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AN ACTUALITY I MEAN THAT'S REALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS IS GONNA GO BEYOND. THE THE GOALS AND ACTUALLY TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE GOALS -- AND AND I I DO I AM I AM HEARTENED BY THE THE SENSE THAT I'M GETTING FROM FROM THE FOLKS OF TESTIFIED THAT. EITHER THAT DAY THAT WE SHARE THE GOAL OF OF OF OF AFFECTION WAITING SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WHAT ABOUT THIS POINT THAT THE SERVER. MERE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE LAND USE DECISIONS WHICH WHICH WAS CONTEMPLATED IN SB THREE SEVEN FIVE SO THAT THEY'LL GET THE HAVE LACK OF A PARTNERSHIP IN THE MANDATE. I MEAN WHAT YOU KNOW BUT I'D COVERING SO THERE'S OF OF CALPERS GOVERNMENTS. REPRESENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES AS WELL NO THERE'S NO DOUBT WE REPRESENT THE REGIONAL AGENCIES KNOW OUR BOARD MEMBERS ALL CITIES COUNTY RIGHT THAT'S YEAH. THE YEAH WE BUT THEY WILL BE QUICK THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL BE QUICK TO TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE NOT SITTING THERE ZONING AUTHORITY TO THE REGIONAL BOARDS. RIGHT. SO THE BILL STILL MAKE INDIVIDUAL LAND USE DECISIONS -- REGARDLESS. RIGHT BUT THERE'S NOTHING -- I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT THAT TAKES THAT AWAY. NO EXCEPT YOU'RE HOLDING THE REGION'S ACCOUNTABLE. FOR FOR THINGS OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCOPE THAT'S A NEW THAT'S IN THREE SEVENTY FIVE NO THIS THIS BILL YOU WOULD YOU'RE ON TRACK TO TO I'M SORRY THE AND I'M SORRY I SHOULD BE ASKING THE CHAIRS MISSION TO SPEAK UP PART. I JUST REALIZED. FOR IT. THERE'S A TURN YOU'RE ASKING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO MAKE AND ALL OF A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THEY ARE ON TRACK OR NOT WITHOUT AN ANALYSIS OF WHY THEY ARE ON OR OFF TRACK. AND AND THAT COULD BE -- FOR IT COULD BE FOR WHERE HOUSING IS LOCATED IT COULD BE BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE FORECASTED THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS AND OUR LETTER WILL SPELL OUT THE DIFFERENT QUOTES THAT ARE IN THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT. THAT SPECIFICALLY SAY WHY AM P. O.'S DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING IN THERE ARE TPS YET. RIGHT CENTER ON YOUR FOR YOUR WHAT YOU GUYS I LOVE JUST TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF I MAY JUST VERY QUICKLY. WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE HAS A A NUMBER OF GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS ON STATE DOLLARS THAT GO TO REGIONS -- THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO AT LEAST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE TO TO FORTIFY AT THE STATE GUIDELINES AND AND TO BEGIN. TO CONNECT THE STATE GUIDELINE ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT -- CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M. INTO REGIONAL DOLLARS THAT ARE THAT WAY INTO STATE DOLLARS THAT GO TO REGIONS SO WE'RE NOT ASKING -- FOR NECESSARILY FOR ADDRESSING ALL OF THOSE BUT IF IF THE OPPOSITION IS IS INTERESTED IN A YOU KNOW THING IS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH AND IT'S A YES AND THEN YEAH I THINK THAT REALLY HELPS THE CONVERSATION. TO BUT TO TO LOOK AT THIS RELATIVELY SMALL. POT OF MONEY ADMITTEDLY HERE -- BY THE BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE STEP -- 10% OF THE DOLLARS TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW MAYBE WE START THERE MAYBE WE START WHERE THE MAJORITY OF STATE DOLLARS THAT GO TO EXPANSION OF ROADWAYS. BECAUSE OTHER DOLLARS FOR THEIR STATE DOLLARS LIKE SHOP IN OTHER MAINTENANCE DOLLARS THOSE DON'T GO TO THE ROADWAY EXPANSIONS ARE ALMOST NEVER -- BUT THE THE STEP IS THAT KIND OF THAT TWEAKING POINT RATE IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT DOES. SET A LEVEL OF GUIDELINES AND IT COMES WITH STATE GUIDELINES AND IT COMES WITH A A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT WE LOOK AT INTER REGIONAL IMPACTS AND WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW REGIONAL IMPACTS FROM STATE DOLLARS. SO WE FELT THAT THAT WAS A GOOD STARTING POINT. TO TO USE THE STEP BECAUSE IT GOES HEAVILY TO ROAD EXPANSION RIGHT NOW THAT IS CONTRARY TO OUR STATE GOALS AND OUR STATE AND OUR INTENTIONS I THINK AND AND COUNTRY REALLY TO OVERALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. I AM AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IT DOESN'T. KNOCK YOU OFF THE LIST AND STEPPED JUST DROPS YOU DOWN SO THEIR PRECIOUS FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE ABILITY. TO TO COMPLETE A PROJECT. OPPOSITION YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO ADD -- IF YOU COULD CLARIFY SIR JUST VERY BRIEFLY YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT -- THE ITS CONNECTION TO SB THREE SEVENTY FUND OF IT THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SIMPLY -- TAGGING ON TO AND PUTTING TEETH INTO WHAT WE HAD -- PREVIOUSLY OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE LAW TODAY. AND I THINK THE IT'S A HUGE -- DISTINCTION THAT IS WORTHY OF OF CONVERSATION AND THAT IS. ON THE WHOLE -- PREMISE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS VALUABLE IS THAT YOU GIVE US A GOAL AND I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION ABOUT HOW HOW WE MET AT AS A REGION. BUT YOU CAN GIVE US A CALL AND WE MADE IT NOT ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS BUT ON A ON A STRATEGY BASIS AND THAT WAS WRONG THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A A AN SCS. A STRATEGY BECAUSE IF YOU START PICKING APART INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS YOU'LL END UP WITH THE VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WITH THE TRANSIT PROJECT&lt;/c&gt; THAT HAS AN INCREASE IN THE EMPTY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING HOLISTICALLY. AND SAID THAT THAT THIS BILL DOES MAKE A HUGE DEPARTURE FROM SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS TO LOOK AT THE GLOBAL PICTURE OF WHAT ALL THESE PROJECTS LOOK LIKE. IN COMBINATION. AND AND THEN AND THEN EVALUATE THEM AND I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE EVALUATION. BUT WHEN YOU START THIS BILL PICKED APART INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND WE THINK THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. I THINK -- I WILL MAKE A MOTION SINCE I'M THE ONLY PERSON HERE ON THE BILL -- AND I WILL ALLOW YOU -- SENT AROUND TO CLOSE. YEAH. I MEAN THERE ARE SOME. I I I I YEAH I'VE BLUFF LET LET LET ME THEM WE'RE WE'RE NOW IT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION THIS AFTERNOON -- THAT THERE ARE SOME -- THIS AGREEMENT THAT I HAVE ABOUT ABOUT THE OF A WE WE CAN PARTS APART WHO'S MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENTS AND AND HOW THAT FITS INTO THE STRATEGY AND AND WILL BE ALLOWED TO LET LET'S LET'S HAVE THAT ROBUST CONVERSATION IS NO QUESTION THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. WE HAVE HERE LIKE WE I WAS SO MANY THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS COMMITTEE IT INVOLVES THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL WEARING OF OF REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY CITIES -- SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN BETWEEN AND IT DOES MAKE IT ALL VERY CHALLENGING AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF FEASIBLE WAY OF ADDRESSING WHAT WE KNOW IS A REAL PROBLEM BUT BUT LET'S LET'S. LET'S TRY TO HONE IT IN A WAY THAT -- WE CAN YOU KNOW FIND MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION APPRECIATE THAT THE THE EMPLOYED AND AND AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY DO HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS. ASSISTANCE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. YES ADAM NUMBER FOURTEEN SB. FIVE TO SIX THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ALLEN ALLEN NAY BATES PHIL. SKINNER. STERN STONE. BY CASKEY AYE AYE CASKEY I'D PUT THAT MATTER ON HOLD FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND THAT'S MOVED TO OUR LAST -- ITEM TODAY THIS IS SB. SIX SIX EIGHTY TWO ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN REGARDING. RADIATIVE FORCING MANAGEMENT CLIMATE ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL. THIS IS A BILL THAT YOU KNOW ONLY ARCHER EMERITUS COULD LOVE -- YES IT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING EARLIER ABOUT -- CLIMB IT. IN A PARTICULAR IT AND A WHAT WE ALWAYS SEEM TO TALK ABOUT IS CARBON -- GIGI -- BUT THERE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE AND WHEN ASKED TO DO -- WITH TEMPERATURE. IN HEAT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO TO TO ADD TO THE CARB TOOL KIT -- SO. SO. YOU KNOW. WHEN WHEN WHEN THE I. P. C. C. THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE I KNOW THAT THE-TERM ARTIST AS WELL? I NEEDED TALKS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED CLIMATE CHANGE IT REALLY FOCUSES ON HOW CRUCIAL IS THAT WE KEEP GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. WITHIN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS OF WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO AVOID. A RUNAWAY WARMING AFFECTS. AND SO I SO AS PART OF THAT -- IT IT'S REALLY GOTTEN PEOPLE TO FOCUS IN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE STABILIZATION AND AND SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW -- THOSE CRITICAL NEAR TERM ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TO REDUCE ACCESS HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO WE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE GASES AND THERE'S AN IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEAT. BUT BUT BUT THE THE QUESTION IF HE IS A IS A A SEPARATE STANDALONE IMPORTANT ISSUE FIRST LOOK AT SO. WHAT ALL THIS BILL DOES ULTIMATELY IS GIVE THE A. R. B.? I. THE NEEDED ANALYTIC TOOLS TO CONSIDER HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION -- SO. YOU DID JUST TO KIND OF GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS A LITTLE BIT OF FOR THE FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND WE TALK ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE USUALLY USE NUMBERS THAT CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF THOSE. GASES OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS THAT'S THAT'S REFERRED TO AS A GAS IS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL. AND WHILE LONG TERM IMPACTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MAKING GOOD PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS. I WILL HAVE TO FACE THE FACT IF WE DON'T KEEP WARMING AND JACK WILL CONTINUE TO FACE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY. GLOBAL WARMING EVEN NOW. AND ANSWER THIS QUESTION IS THIS ISSUE OF RADIATIVE FORCING IT'S A MEASURE. OF HOW MUCH HE IS TRAPPED IN A SPECIFIC AREA AT A SPECIFIC TIME. AS COMPARED TO GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL A RADIATIVE FORCING LETS US CAN CONSIDER LOCAL FAX. OF THINGS LIKE SMOKE LAND USE CHANGES RESIDUAL MISSIONS. OUR RADIO FORCING AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL. WILL IDEALLY WORK HAND IN HAND -- IN GIVING US A BETTER PICTURE OF CHANGES THAT WE CAN -- THEN -- MAKE THAT WILL BOTH AFFECT GLOBAL GLOBAL CLIMATE NOW BUT ALSO GLOBAL CLIMATE. IN THE FUTURE SO THIS BILL HELPS TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA. I IN ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING CLIMB IMPLY IMPACTS OF HUMAN ACTIONS BY MOVING BEYOND JUST THE ISSUE OF JEWISH SEASON CARBON -- AND AND LOOKING AT A RADIO FORCING AND HE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE JO CAVES IN THE CONSERVATION STRATEGY GROUP ALSO TAUGHT DELANEY WAS. A DOCTOR AT PROFESSOR AND AND CHAIR OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE CORNING COMMITTEE AT THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION AND THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE SUPPORT MEASURE. A MISTER CHAIRMAN JOE CAVES -- CONSERVATION STRATEGY GROUP -- JUST VERY BRIEFLY SO THIS BILL IS SMALL IT'S TECHNICAL BUT IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. IN THAT IT STARTS THE PROCESS OF ALIGNING CALIFORNIA WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE AND PARTICULARLY pWITH REGARD TO THE IPCC'S WARNING ABOUT THE URGENCY TO MOVE QUICKLY. ON HEAT REDUCTION OUR EXISTING PROGRAM UNDER AB THIRTY TWO IS DOING WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO LONG TERM TO REDUCE THIS YEAR TO BUILD UP. BUT IT WILL NOT REACH THE GOALS THE I. P. C. C. IS IDENTIFIED OF REDUCING RADIATIVE FORCING THAT HEAT BUILD UP BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY ESTABLISHING A STANDARD TO EVALUATE THAT WILL GIVE CARVE THE TOOLS. REALLY TO DESIGN THE IMMEDIATE PROGRAM WE NEED IT'LL HELP DRIVE GLOBAL PROGRESS IF CALIFORNIA BEGINS THAT PROCESS AS WELL AS IDENTIFY THE THINGS WE CAN DO HERE. TO HELP DEAL WITH THE HEAT BUILD UP THAT WE'RE SEEING AS A AFFECT BOTH REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY. AND INCREASED -- WILDFIRES AND THE WHOLE HOST OF IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THEIR CURRENT QUICKLY SO WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. NEXT CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE THIS DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR ALAN FOR AUTHORING FOR THIS LEGISLATION. MY NAME IS TODD DELANEY. I CHAIR THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE COORDINATING COMMITTEE. ESTABLISHED BY AYSO THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION. WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON CLIMATE RELATED STANDARDS AND HELPS TO ENSURE THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS SUPPORT A ROBUST RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. DESPITE THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO DATE CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE. CALIFORNIA IS SUFFERING ITS OWN SHARE OF CLIMATE RELATED IMPACTS DROUGHTS FLOODS MUD SLIDES. IN FIRES WHICH HAVE IMPACTED MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. BUT THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE A CRITICAL NEXT STEP. IS THE ADOPTION OF THE RADIATIVE FORCING BASED CLIMATE PROTOCOL TO COMPLEMENT CURRENT CLIMATE ACCOUNTING EFFORTS. AYSO RELIES ON IPCC -- REPORTS AS NORMATIVE RESTAURANT REFERENCES TO ENSURE THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ARE BASED UPON MOST UP TO DATE SCIENCE. I AM CONVENING THE ICE SO EFFORT. TO STANDARDIZE THE RADIATIVE FORCING ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL DERIVED FROM IPCC'S FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT. THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW THE GW P. ONE HUNDRED ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE IPCC'S SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT. IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES THE PROTOCOL HAS ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED BY LEADING U. S. SCIENTISTS AND CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR COALITION SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY PANEL. IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL REVIEW. ADOPTING A RADIATIVE FORCING BASED PROTOCOL THROUGH SB SIX EIGHTY TILL TWO WILL ALLOW. WILL REINFORCE CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER ON CLIMATE CHANGE. SETTING THE STAGE TO HELP THE WORLD AVOID OVERSHOOTING GLOBAL TEMPERATURE TARGETS. THIS PROTOCOL BRINGS GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR CLIENTS. ARE CLIMATE IMPROVES METRICS IN NEW INSIGHTS TO PRIORITIZE MITIGATION ACTIONS THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY AND COST EFFECTIVELY CAN. STABILIZE CLIMATE ESPECIALLY BELOW BETWEEN NOW IN. TWENTY THIRTY THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME IF SB SIX EIGHTY TWO IS PASSED INTO LAW THIS YEAR IT WILL LOW CARB. TO EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT THE PROTOCOL WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THIS WOULD REINFORCE THE ADOPTION. OF THIS PROTOCOL BY OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA'S EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP FOR GUIDANCE. KNOWING HOW LONG IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY REGULATORY CHANGES CAN TAKE. I BELIEVE SB SIX EIGHTY TWO COULD SPEED UP GLOBAL ADOPTION BY AS MUCH AS FIVE YEARS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TIMING CANNOT BE OVERSTATED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ARE YOUR TO YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF SB -- SIX EIGHT TWO SIX EIGHT TWO GOOD AFTERNOON AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S LOVE CARDIO CORTESE AND I WAS ASKED BY DOCTOR JUSHIN DEL WHO'S THE ONE OF THE LEAD. COORDINATING AUTHORS ON THE FIFTH ANNUAL ASSESSMENT BY ABOUT THE I. P. C. C. AS WELL AS THE ONE POINT FIVE REPORT. AS WELL AS COMMITTEE CHAIR OF THE SEE SEE A OF SEE SEE A WHICH IS THE CLIMATE AND AIR RECENT RESORT INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE RENEE RESOURCE COMMITTEE -- AND HE URGES HIS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. HI I'M LINDA BROWN AND I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR MICHAEL MCCRACKEN. HE IS A CAREER HE WAS A CAREER CLIMATE RESEARCHER AND LEAD SCIENTIST FOR AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY -- HE WAS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BODY THE% NATIONAL -- ASSESSMENT COORDINATION OFFICE WHICH CREATED THE FIRST NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT REPORT YOU KNOW THAT THE FOURTH ONE WAS JUST ISSUED. AND HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRST ONE HE WAS ALSO -- AN ADVISER TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON CLIMATE RESEARCH AND HAS HAD MANY OTHER IMPORTANT CLIMATE POST INCLUDING HIS IS VERY -- PROBLEMS PROLIFIC ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IPCC. AND HE IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS -- BILL SIR THANK YOU HE WANTS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE'S STANDING BY TO BE OF ASSISTANCE IN ANY WAY HE CAN. MY NAME IS JIM WILSON AND I'M HERE TODAY FOR DOCTOR ROBERT HOWARTH OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY IN IPCC'S SCIENTIST AND RENOWNED. METHANE EXPERT. WHO'S ASKED ME TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL SIX EIGHTY TWO ON HIS BEHALF. AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO YOU IS NEEDED. I THANK YOU -- I'VE NEVER HAD SO MANY AGENTS FOR SINCE RE RESEARCH SCIENTISTS -- LET'S HEAR OPPOSITION -- TO A. B. R. SB. SIX EIGHT TWO IS THERE ANYBODY HERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE. RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING BRING BACK TO DAIS [inaudible] THERE IS. ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS -- Là AB ONE IN THERE I'M I APPRECIATE THE THE CREATIVITY BEHIND. THE THE MEASURE IN MORE THAN THAT JUST THE THE BRAIN POWER -- IT'S INTIMIDATING YEAH SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW. HOW TO ASK A QUESTION -- THAT LIVES UP TO THE LEVEL OF RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN. GOING ON WITH IN THIS PROCESS AND TO ALL BEEN LEADING I JUST. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT BEYOND BEYOND IT BEYOND SORT OF BETTER TRUTH IN ACCOUNTING OR OR A BIT YOU KNOW MORE HONEST NUMBERS? DO YOU SEE THIS ACTUALLY. ALLOWING US TO HAVE IS THIS ABOUT LIKE SORT OF MAKE OUR STRATEGY MORE ORGANIZED AND COHERENT AND SORT OF ALIGNMENT BASIC CROSS SHORT LIVED AND LONG LIVED -- TYPES OF POLLUTANTS OR IS THIS ABOUT SORT OF ORGANIZING AND COHERENCE IN THOSE EFFORTS OR IS IT ARE WE MISSING THINGS RIGHT NOW IN OUR ACCOUNTING THAT WE WE AT WE DON'T EVEN TRULY UNDERSTAND. THE THE THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING. YOUR YOUR CHOICE CENTER ON WHAT WELLNESS WHICH LIKE THAT. I THINK I THINK I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT I LOVE TO HAVE -- THE TO EXPRESS COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON BOTH COUNTS -- WE THINK THAT THIS KIND OF ACCOUNTING WILL WILL RE PRIORITIZE VERTICALLY IN THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AS WELL AS IDENTIFY OTHER ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE. BECAUSE THE URGENCY OF STARTING TO THAT PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO BRING DOWN HEAT AS WELL AS PROVIDING CARBS EXPERTISE THAT CAN THEN BE. USED BY OTHER COUNTRIES AND SORT OF THE DRIVE THE MOMENTUM INTERNATIONALLY BECAUSE WE NEED THAT TO HAPPEN AS WELL. NINE IDOLING LIKE TO AGREE -- TO WITH THAT AND WHAT I'M CURRENTLY DOING IS WE'RE STARTING UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION. IS IN FACT THE WITHIN THE NEXT -- THREE WEEKS WILL BE HAVING OUR FIRST MEETING ON ABOUT A THIRTY FIVE PAGE DOCUMENT THE DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RADIATIVE FORCING. A AND R. PROCESS WILL TAKE US ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO GO THROUGH SO THAT WE WILL HAVE A GUIDANCE STANDARD THAT WILL BE. AVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD WE'RE PRIMARILY MADE UP OF COUNTRIES AS OPPOSED TO STATE -- AND SO THIS WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION. THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CARVE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EIGHT USE THIS AND IMPLEMENTED IN. WHATEVER WAY THEY CHOOSE BUT THEY WILL HAVE ALL OF THE BASES FOR BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW. WE DON'T WANT THE PROBLEM TO BE ANY WORSE THAN WE THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT GETS WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT WE ALSO CAN'T LIGHT OR SELF. SO. I JUST WHAT WE WANT THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENCE DRIVING STATE POLICY AYE I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO THE THE THE NUANCES TO IMPLEMENTATION AND THERE'S EXISTING PROGRAMS GOING ON IN THE SCIENCE. YOU'RE DRILLING DOWN THERE'S AN EIGHTEENTH MONTH PROCESS BEIGE APPRECIATE YOU DRIVING THIS FORWARD SAID AROUND THIS IS THE MEDIAN FORCED THE CONVERSATION NOT RADIATIVE LEE FORCING THE CONVERSATION MAYBE -- I'M GLAD WE CAN IS IT THAT WE NEED A LITTLE LEVITY THESE DAYS IN THIS IN THIS ARENA OF POLICY BUT I WANT TO JOIN YOU IF YOU WHEN YOU TAKEN IF YOU TAKE A MOMENT ON THE ROAD AS CO AUTHOR AND HELP YOU ALONG YOUR BECAUSE I THINK. IT'S A VERY WHERE THE CONVERSATION THANKS ALMOST THE BILL INAPPROPRIATE THERE IS A MOTION WE RECOGNIZE IT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE.

DO YOU DO IT'S BASICALLY. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE QUESTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE THERE ONE PARTICULAR LANDS IT'S AN IMPORTANT LINES BUT THERE ARE OTHER LENSES THROUGH WHICH TO LOOK AT IT AND AND AND AND AND WE WE WE KNOW WE'RE MISSING SOME THINGS AS A RESULT OF THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN -- AND AND THIS THIS WILL JUST GIVE THE CARBON NEW ANALYTICAL TOOL TO HELP US BE MORE HOLISTIC IN OUR PRECIOUS. ACCIDENTAL CHALLENGE AND SO WITH THAT I I RESPECTFULLY **** COMMITTEE SUPPORT. THANK YOU ASSISTANCE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IN ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN SB. SIX EIGHT TWO M. F. THERE. M..
