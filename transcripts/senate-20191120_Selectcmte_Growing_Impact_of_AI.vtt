impeachment hearings and I'm

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.342
I'm sure many are just

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.046
switching back and forth. So.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:20.613

morning everyone welcome to the

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.256
city of Anaheim first off and

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.325
one I think a select committee

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.227
chair senator Tom Umberg and

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.162
the select committee members

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.031
for bringing this important

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.033
discussion to our city and

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.600
allowing our community. The

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.402
opportunity to be part of this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.039
dialogue California is the

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:46.573
birthplace of some of our

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.441
nation's greatest technological

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.410
advances and I am glad to see

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.312
that our leaders have

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.147
acknowledged this and are

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.316
taking steps your research and

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.017
determine the best practices

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.253
for working with ever changing

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.057
medium. Our justice system.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:04.657
Access data and technological

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:05.191
tools is greater than ever

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.261
before. Law enforcement's

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.296
ability to access this

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.165
continues to grow. It is

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.300
important that we are mindful

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.336
of this and how these new

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.538
mediums can positively impact

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:22.141
the ability of law enforcement

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:22.742
to uphold the law while also

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.177
being respectful of our

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.379
residents right to privacy. I

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.381
am encouraged Mister chairman

hearing I'm really excited to

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.584
be here and I'm glad that he

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.386
was able to work with the two

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.454
days in our on our schedule- I

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.623
am also a founding member of

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.725
the tech innovation caucus so

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.694
truly is an honor for me here-

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.763
I am excited that artificial

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.364
intelligence is getting so much

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.266
attention in the legislature

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.535
and that we do have a clearing

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.604
house for information in

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.171
hearings. This newly formed

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.608
come. Yeah changing everything

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:09.108
we do and we have to pay

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.610
attention. Today we'll hear

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.210
about law enforcement but a I

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.745
also transforming the landscape

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.480
of transportation healthcare.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.317
And how governments function. I

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:18.918
authored legislation this year

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.753
after year as did other members

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.257
of the legislature to leverage

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:24.891
a I. for the benefit of state

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.626
government and bill protections

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.594
against. Potential harms a I

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.697
create. The governor made clear

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.665
this year he wants little

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.600
legislative regulation around

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.337
the space at least for now. He

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.606
believes his the he is the work

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.375
Michigan is joining inception

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.410
to tackle the challenges ahead

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.546
of us so I hope that's true but

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.514
I tend to believe we will need

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:48.948
to solidify and copy

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.418
protection. Around it in the

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:56.589
coming years it's clear their

00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:00.526
husband. Is with. Buy low and

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.127
for and it is our job to make

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:01.661
sure the benefits are not

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:02.562
drowned out. These negative

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.597
consequences like proliferating

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.265
bias through a I. job reduction

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:06.799
in breaching privacy. I'm

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.267
excited to hear from testimony.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:08.801
The committee has brought

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.269
together some very exciting

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:10.903
experts so thank you so much

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.440
for being here and I look for

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.275
to our conversation. Thank you.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:18.411
Thank you Sir John- we are

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.446
going to have a public comment

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.381
after we have the panelists-

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.015
testify in and respond to some

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.519
of our enquiries- we may have

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.521
depend upon the number of folks

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.690
who want to provide public

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.560
comment- we may. Have to limit

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:35.161
it to number of minutes we'll

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.629
we'll take that this. Later on

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.798
so let let let us begin first

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.533
of let me call up. Recent

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.401
retired special agent in charge

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.303
of security investigations here

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.639
in Los Angeles- special agent

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.708
Claude Arnold special agent

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.643
Arnold of first let me begin

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.478
with the politically incorrect

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.112
comic you look way too young to

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.482
been retired but- so. Been

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.651
retired for four years after

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.787
serving for twenty seven years

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:01.420
okay well listen up double down

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.624
on the counter so. Much for

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.859
having me US senators on Bergen

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.463
Chang- happy here to speak to

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.030
the committee a little bit

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.467
about- my experience and

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:18.404
understanding- with the use of

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:18.905
artificial intelligence

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:22.408
federally. And specifically

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.410
with of my former agency-

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:28.414
homeland security

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.416
investigations which is a

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.050
component of US immigration and

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.587
customs enforcement. I'll say

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.756
at the outset that I am not an

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:40.426
artificial intelligence expert.

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.628
So you know I can share my

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.664
experiences but I certainly

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.599
don't understand technically

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.668
how works I know how to

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:52.405
strategically and tactically

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:52.905
and I'm gonna give some

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:53.506
examples this morning. Of how

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.709
that is done. How would it's

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.578
been very effective as I've

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.780
experience throughout my career

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.849
so I served a brief background

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:06.619
on myself I ice last served as

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.487
a special agent in charge for

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.423
almond security investigations

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:10.990
here in Los Angeles for the

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.859
last for five years until my

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:16.562
retirement at the end of twenty

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.129
fifteen. Prior to that I was

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:20.466
especially been in charge in a

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.401
Minneapolis Minnesota and I

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.403
area of responsibility was a

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.037
five state region there in the

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:28.574
Midwest- I served in senior

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.411
positions in headquarters and

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.513
then you know my career it is

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.784
with us fads I. Across the U.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.786
S. as I promoted transferred

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.455
Midwest south west east coast.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:46.893
So yeah you know artificial

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.861
intelligence but by definition

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.863
it's just the development of

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.832
computer systems are able to

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.767
perform tasks that normally

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.903
require human intelligence it

00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:00.573
you know in its simplest form a

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.642
one example that I like to cite

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.810
an an early example of

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.812
artificial intelligence is

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:10.516
license plate readers so-

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:14.520
probably in the nineties- mid

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.121
to late nineties the federal

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.689
government started using the

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.624
license plate read. That

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.693
automatically a recorded

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.595
license plates and then ran

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.664
those license placed against

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.699
various federal and other

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.901
databases to identify potential

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:32.772
violations of law. You know in

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:34.941
in my- world we used it to

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:38.644
identify drug smugglers- human

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:42.882
traffickers. People involved in

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.850
with in crime with the nexus to

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:48.721
the border. So even though you

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.589
know someone at near or in

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.525
quarters at or near the ports

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.694
of entry- license would be

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.829
license plates would be

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:57.463
recorded and then they would be

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.898
run across databases okay this

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.535
person may be headed south

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.102
they're connected to a case

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.737
this vehicle with drug

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:08.607
smuggling and they may have. B.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:10.609
smuggling money southbound so

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:12.545
when they the port of entry-

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.847
you we wanted we want to do a

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.949
border search on that vehicle

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:18.851
or maybe we want the border

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.987
patrol over or in one of our

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:24.957
local because they make. Going

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:28.794
proceeds extra. But or weapons

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:29.395
thing like. So that that's an

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.896
early example of artificial

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:34.533
intelligence- but you know.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.134
Artificial intelligence is you

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:35.601
several ways and law

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:36.869
enforcement it can be used for

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:40.740
crime analysis so. Cried and

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:44.577
analysis geographic Belle says.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:46.846
Data analysis- network analysis

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.714
tell of on a record analysis

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.315
you know good example of this

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.983
is- phone link analysis and

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.785
this is something that started

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.054
probably in the late eighties

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.856
early nineties where in

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:57.289
connection with an

00:10:57.356 --> 00:11:00.793
investigation you have a bunch

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.661
of phone numbers either

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:06.599
connected to a- an intercept of

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:07.199
phone intercept court ordered

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:10.636
phone intercepts or or just a-

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.938
pen registers what we call it

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.640
just recording phone numbers

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:15.241
from people who you think are

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.009
involved in criminal activity.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.011
Well you link these phone

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.980
numbers to kind of create a

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.650
picture of what the criminal

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.652
activity is and who the players

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.654
are in the criminal activity

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:32.658
very early example of using a

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.727
computer software to do the

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.862
linkage instead of doing it on

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:40.699
a white board. It's a lot more.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:43.035
At the end another great

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:43.536
example of artificial

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:44.837
intelligence that that is an

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:45.404
early example is strategic

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.939
analysis- so. You know this is

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:50.643
strategic targeting for example

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.177
I think one of the best

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:53.012
examples of this is Los Angeles

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.680
police department's compstat a

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.816
lot of departments and agencies

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.651
have employed that. That

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.653
strategy and that's where you

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:04.657
use. Computers to compile crime

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:08.828
statistics. Identify potential

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.063
threat areas so that you can

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.767
dedicate resources. Areas where

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:15.334
there's an emerging from all

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.071
threats. So I a you know given

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.675
some examples of. Early

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:24.743
artificial intelligence I want

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.277
to give you a couple more

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:28.647
examples. So get out of bases

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.749
another one and early on in my

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.918
career I was assigned to the

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.753
violent gang task force. The

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.689
day cold a lot of data about.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:40.659
Many documented gang members

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.728
and they allow investigators to

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.830
make connections when there's a

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:46.999
crime between people identify

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.968
potential suspects they have

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.903
bio metrics in them

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.005
photographs- and where there's

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.675
photo recognition capability-

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:59.011
you can identify suspects

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:03.048
through a photo so- I can give

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.852
an example where I was.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:07.419
Inducting investigation of

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.155
taking case this was in the

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.190
nineties and I was in Phoenix

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.092
Arizona agent and this was

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:16.862
ground zero for- human

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:17.463
smuggling and trafficking in

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.131
the whole U. S. and so street

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:23.002
gangs were- engaging and

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.037
hostage taking taking people

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.039
hostage. And then they could

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.874
hold them for their human

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:29.441
smuggling fee that still M.

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:31.043
from human smuggling

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.780
organizations. With guns in

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:35.347
their be shoot outs on our

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.149
people caught in the middle

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.784
people get murdered at center

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.819
was horrible- but so I had a

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.788
case where street gang head-

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.957
head of doc did a group of

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.892
Ecuadorian nationals who had

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.094
been smuggled into the U. S. at

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:55.100
gun point. And when we can get

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:58.871
a search warrant locate. We a

00:13:58.938 --> 00:13:59.438
photograph of a person bill

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.072
didn't know who they were this

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.240
is ninety two thousand so the

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:02.775
technology even existed them.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:03.342
But of the Phoenix police

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:03.909
department at the time was

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.077
using photo recognition

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:07.179
software and we're able to run

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.048
that through their databases

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.783
and we were able to identify

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.952
one of the gang members who was

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.787
involved. By this photograph

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:15.287
who previously was not

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:18.924
identified. So that's another

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.993
early example of. Artificial

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.865
intelligence so how does- H. a

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.968
sigh use- artificial

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:32.938
intelligence now well. Probably

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.974
the biggest way of that not

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.909
only H. aside but all federal

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.111
agencies use artificial

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:40.980
intelligence is through the

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:44.984
compilation of disparate data

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.887
right so there's many databases

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.923
both federal and public

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.490
database. That have a lot of

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:55.027
information. But they're

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.962
separate databases and so in

00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:00.899
the old days- an investigator.

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:01.467
Who that was investigating

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:04.770
let's say a specific individual

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:05.337
as part of an organization

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.874
whatever they would have to go

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.976
run this person in this

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:11.543
database on the person this

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.279
database or you know to try and

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.080
find out as much information

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:15.614
about that target or even

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:19.151
organization. And that take

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:19.752
time and then that person so

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.120
would have trying to establish

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:24.890
connections between multiple

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:25.424
subjects of say a criminal

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:29.161
organization. From all these

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.263
disparate data I mean you can

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.165
see how that is very time

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.234
consuming labor intensive and

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:41.006
requires quite frankly. The

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:41.640
limitations of the investigator

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:46.879
that the human being. So now

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:47.513
what's that there's these their

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.883
systems that you know so all

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:53.052
this data is for and again I'm

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.887
not computer scientist I'm not

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:57.056
in a I. expert but- basically

00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:00.893
all this data. Is put into a

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:01.493
central location and there's a

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.030
system that. Compiles at all

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.066
and makes connections linkages

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.301
you know the proverbial six

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:13.172
degrees of separation- and that

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:14.973
so this can be used and

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.076
criminal investigations in

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.977
terrorism investigations. In

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.913
child exploitation

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:21.513
investigations etcetera so bad

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.952
is. Probably currently how

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.921
artificial intelligence.

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:32.891
Currently is most used by both

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:33.292
homeland security

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:33.792
investigations and other

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:38.897
federal agents. A couple

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:42.901
examples- so after right after

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:49.041
nine eleven I know H. a site.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.076
Developed you know through

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:53.178
contractors obviously a system

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.214
that did Josh this and the

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.084
purpose of it was specifically

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.253
for. To contribute to terrorism

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.188
investigations and terrorism

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:05.090
travel right because DHS has

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.459
data on how people travel but

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.261
then you take other data and

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.430
you make you know suspected

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.332
terrorists the different watch

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:17.069
lists. And travel patterns et

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:17.636
cetera and you you can make

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:21.407
these. Connections to people

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.275
where the human being in human

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.177
investigator might not have

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:25.744
made that connection because

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.413
there are several degrees of

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:31.083
separation but now with the use

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.717
of artificial intelligence and

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.419
these are computer programs

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.421
that can be done and you can

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.356
identify a potential threat.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.260
Whereas previously that threat

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.228
may not have been identified

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.164
it's also used for example

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.001
child X. Isshin investigations-

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:55.140
there are certain. First of all

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.009
I you know H. a size of federal

00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:59.011
agency that probably conducts

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:01.013
more child **** and child

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:03.115
exploitation destinations than

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:05.017
any other federal agency so-

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:05.684
they become very adept at doing

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.087
so and leveraging technology to

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.023
facilitate that so for example.

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:13.325
You know child sex tourism it's

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.194
a federal violation to travel

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.097
internationally obviously. To

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.033
go foreign and engaging in sex

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:23.135
act with with a child a but

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:23.735
it's a problem so how how do

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:27.039
you solve this problem well.

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:27.673
You can use our an artificial

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.374
intelligence is used to look at

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:33.111
people registered sex offenders

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.280
at center all this data from

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:37.249
disparate databases travel

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.384
patterns to identify potential

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.320
threats who may be traveling.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:45.123
To engage in child sex tourism.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.392
So that of foreign governments

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:51.430
can be notified. And perhaps

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:53.332
prevent- a child being

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.200
victimized and it happens all

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:55.734
the time ice has a program

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.503
called angel watch and they

00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:01.206
just opened the center. It

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:03.408
ribbon cutting last week and

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.143
it's multiple federal agencies

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.145
and that the purpose is just

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.214
that to identify people who

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:13.151
they're intent may be to travel

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.120
to engage in child sex tourism

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:15.687
and hopefully. Prevent that

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:21.126
from happening. Another

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:21.527
examples financial

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:25.330
investigations every agency not

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:25.864
just federal agents every

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:29.568
agency. That conducts criminal

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:31.470
designations has a component of

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.405
which is a financial

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:35.307
investigation follow the money

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.609
so again it would require an

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.478
investigator and analysts to go

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.580
through lots of different data

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.415
things and try and make a

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.250
connection whereas using

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:45.751
artificial intelligence

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:49.187
computer programs. You can.

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:49.788
Detect anomalies in financial

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.158
activity- for example

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:53.692
structuring right someone

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:57.129
making deposits repetitively

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:59.264
just under the federal

00:19:59.331 --> 00:19:59.865
reporting requirement of ten

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:03.135
thousand dollars- if you have

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.137
computer systems doing that.

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:09.141
You can identify a pattern of

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:09.775
potential criminal behavior and

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.443
identify a larger criminal

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.213
organization. I think that. In

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.251
the future going forward. What

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:23.155
one of the best applications

00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:25.157
for artificial intelligence is

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:25.691
that. What the nine eleven

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.359
commission. One of the

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:31.163
recommendations was to unify

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:33.231
the many participants in the

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:33.799
counterterrorism effort and

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.500
their knowledge and their

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.502
knowledge in a network based

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:41.239
information stern system that

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:41.707
transcends traditional

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.475
government boundaries because

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:47.379
what we learned after nine

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:47.946
eleven we learn that. Even

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.648
federal agencies work talk you

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:50.148
know these turf battles

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:53.251
certainly they were sharing

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:53.819
information with state and

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.554
local governments and we found

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:57.556
that that still has been a

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:01.360
problem I that will that will.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:05.397
That that may have. The Boston

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:06.031
Marathon bombing right. It it's

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.733
all due to a lack of sharing of

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.468
information so. Artificial

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:13.271
intelligence can occur bush. Is

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.507
our facilitate making these

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.542
connections and sharing his

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.244
informations across

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.246
jurisdictional boundaries right

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:23.448
and that would protect us all

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:27.252
from- potential public safety

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:29.254
or national security threats

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.456
course. The big thing is it has

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:33.425
to be done within the legal

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:37.262
framework and in a way. That

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.564
that doesn't violate people's

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:43.301
privacy rights. I hope I didn't.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:47.439
Go over thank you no thank you

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:49.408
special agent Arnold- before

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.042
you with homeland security what

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:55.347
agency were you with. So my

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:55.947
career started with the I. N.

00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:59.551
S. yeah. In this is something

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.586
I'm gonna hope I can perhaps

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:07.392
tap into each of the experts

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.294
here with respect artificial.

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:09.861
All of the concerns with our

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:11.363
intelligence is that it such

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.532
that it actually replaces human

00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:15.434
beings in terms of decision

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.867
making and what the

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:17.569
implications are whether that

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:19.671
that there is some sort of

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:21.273
implicit bias for example

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:23.275
that's incorporated into

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:27.345
whatever design. Is created to

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:29.448
have that algorithm actually

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.550
make decisions so for example

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:33.618
decisions as to where resources

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:37.355
should be decisions as to- for

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:37.889
example who should be who

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:41.259
should be a fight as a suspect-

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:41.860
one of the issues that we're

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.662
faced is facial recognition

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:49.267
technology in Sacramento. So in

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:51.403
terms of the future- special

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.672
Arnold are there any concerns

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:57.576
that you have about the future

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:59.511
of artificial legends and how

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:00.112
it may at the river. Either

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:01.713
humans into decision making or

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.450
how there may be some sort of

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.519
implicit bias that that may

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.621
lead to stone- pass the two

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:15.427
questions. Yes so I don't think

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:16.061
you ever be able to remove the

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:16.728
human element from the decision

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:17.796
making. Process whether on the

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:21.433
macro or or micro level so for

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:21.900
example just on the

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.702
investigator level you may have

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:27.506
one of these systems. Create

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.441
some language linkages and

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:33.378
identify potential- a potential

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.480
target and maybe someone who's

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.081
involved in criminal activity

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:37.783
but then that person is still

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:41.486
going to have to present that

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.388
case to a local prosecutor

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:44.022
they're still going to have to.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.657
You know on an affidavit

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.726
articulate probable cause for

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:51.797
some of legal action against a

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:55.467
target you a I will ever be

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:57.669
able to do that for the person

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:59.404
they're not gonna be able just

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:00.005
to swap out an affidavit from

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:03.775
front. Page so. I'm I think

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.712
that. Now could still be

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.748
misused. Yeah but but anyone

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:11.583
Forsman tool or any law

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.184
enforcement authority can be

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.420
abused and misused so it's a

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:17.656
incumbent upon law enforcement

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:21.726
agencies to have policies in

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:25.497
place. You know M. most of them

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:27.599
already do- that that when

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.835
authority is abuse or misuse

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:33.405
that- people are disciplined

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.640
and- you know so others are

00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:37.576
deterred from doing that as

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.678
well I think that the in the

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:41.847
future- artificial intelligence

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.582
actually could create the

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:45.584
affidavit obviously you can M.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.552
machine swear to it but

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:48.119
actually could created. An

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.754
affidavit to be submitted to a

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.823
judge shouldn't one would hope

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.290
that the Jeff is not a

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:55.393
computer- but the anyway that

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.395
that that's a concern so thank

00:24:57.462 --> 00:25:00.031
you- Senate check if questions.

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:05.871
Comments. We're talking about

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:06.438
homeland security I have a

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.706
really quick question- are you

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:09.507
aware of how a I've been using

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.676
immigration and refugee. With

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:13.945
Roth G. system if. There's any

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.814
currently. Well the refugee

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:19.718
system is at and the G. to

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.486
catia refugee applications is

00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:23.388
not done by my former agency.

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.690
You know violations of the law

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:26.124
relating to that are

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.726
investigated by my former

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:29.828
agency so yeah I'm not aware

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:37.502
of. Any he- current application

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:38.036
of a I. in relation to the

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:45.510
refugee system. Thank you US

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:47.579
special agent Arnold let's now

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.581
turn to US Surgeon McDonald and

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:50.215
certainly bottled up would ask

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.518
you some of the same questions-

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:55.520
I do think that in the future

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:57.722
that- there will be the

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:59.891
creation of affidavits I think

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.893
that in terms of judiciary

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.795
there probably will be program

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.797
lease that that they can be.

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:09.501
They can be braided or that

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.101
those affidavits to be plugged

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.736
in. And analysis as to whether

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:13.605
or not there is. Probable cause

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:15.507
such that that I the machine

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:17.642
can machine maybe. Not the

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:19.511
right term but that the system

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:21.579
can't can generate an answer or

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:23.682
deficiencies- that that may

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:29.521
exist. In Andy affidavits- so

00:26:29.587 --> 00:26:30.021
let me turn to sergeant

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:31.890
McDonald serving Donald. Thank

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:37.529
you here's. So first of all

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:38.129
thank you very much for having

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:38.730
me today I really appreciate-

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.764
taking the time to listen to

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:40.398
Mike to kind of my incite over

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.700
I can provide that to you. A

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.568
little bit as to how we're at

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.603
on the state local side- it's

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.539
just a little bit about me I

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.574
come from a little bit of a bit

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:51.509
different background- I work

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:52.143
for the Orange County sheriff's

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.812
department. Been there twenty

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.580
years now. And I've had my

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.916
range of experience Lara forced

00:26:57.983 --> 00:27:01.953
starting in the John working

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.722
patrol and after I went to a-

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.690
she went. To work with the

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:06.257
joint person task force with

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:07.759
the FBI so. The topics are in

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:08.393
talk about I have experience on

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.627
the federal side as well

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:10.228
working through Faiza data and

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.898
that larger. Data collection if

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.934
you will- and then more

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:16.434
recently I was promoted

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:20.071
sergeant- and put in charge of

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:20.739
a crime analysis detail so now

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.742
I'm looking at- the difference

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:24.275
our collection systems-

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:26.044
different data collection that

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.712
we have and how. To apply that

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:28.279
not necessarily to national

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:29.681
security or

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.916
counterintelligence. Threat but

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:35.620
more so on the local a crime

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:36.154
level looking at solving a

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:39.691
soldier or perhaps. So. My

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:41.626
despair back a little bit about

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.728
personally for me though I'm a

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:45.830
very private person- Leyva live

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:47.732
streaming this for me is a good

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.734
step in the- you know like.

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:51.636
Hello world I'm here I'm

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.270
definitely not on social media

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.838
at this there are people are

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.740
you right exactly yeah well

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:56.274
you're welcome that's the

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:59.878
thermic right. So you know you

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:01.813
will not find online at a lot

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.848
of. Measures in my personal

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:07.752
life to remove myself. From

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:08.353
that kind digital footprint if

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.990
you will. First because of my

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:12.590
previous assignment I didn't

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:13.625
want anybody else knowing where

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:14.225
I lived or what I did. So I'm-

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.960
I'm kind of in a in a unique

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.729
situation that. Here I am

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.831
trying to find clues that

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:21.633
people left but at the same

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:22.233
time remove myself from those

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.968
very same system I used. To

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:25.670
find people soft right. Sir a

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.672
little bit different let me.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.874
And as I go through this

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:30.508
hopefully I'll give you a good

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.643
pictures to what we're using

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.645
currently in I. a I and we're

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.212
we're kind of I think we're

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:36.047
headed and then probably some

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:37.649
concerns that I have on that

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:39.851
I'm really private side- so

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:43.888
currently at in a minute Nancy

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.657
and at my local you know.

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.826
Southern California peer agency.

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.894
Probably the away is-

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.863
government data solutions is

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.698
typically pretty slow to

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:54.332
develop and evolve and I think

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.000
we're really struggling even in

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:59.804
my own agency to come up with

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:00.338
data real time little on

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:04.008
predictive- it- now looking at

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.712
our our crime analysis unit and

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:08.346
what it is that we're doing the

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:12.050
steps that were king I think

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:12.650
we're getting a lot closer to

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:13.885
get. Real time data. I will

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:16.254
visit department recently went

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.689
paperless with the reporting.

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:20.125
Five years ago- so if you look

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:22.127
at how it is we're we're coming

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:23.761
along there's a lot to take in

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:24.362
a in a very short amount of

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.131
time and I think that you know

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.133
as we look at it and

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:28.733
implementing these new. Data

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.168
forms would really need to take

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:31.736
a good strategic look and see

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:33.805
where we want to be and how is

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.807
it we want to use this data and

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:39.844
for. Future growth so.

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.813
Currently in NY who kind of

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.380
sphere of influence that the

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:43.014
systems that we're using right

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.115
now. Are predominately facial

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.017
recognition- I will tell you

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.052
that- you know the systems that

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:50.021
we use are. Are reactive it's

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:50.588
not like we have a passive

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:52.123
system. I. with government

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.092
counters cameras mounted up

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.960
places actively. Getting you

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.996
know photographs of everybody

00:29:58.062 --> 00:30:00.131
in in the community. It's

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.933
typically we have our our data

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.002
set of photographs we have from

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.937
jail booking photos or things

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:09.774
like that. And compare it with.

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:11.910
Hey we have crime we have this

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:12.477
you know ring. Bell or you

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.747
have. You know stores CZ.

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:16.381
Camera we have a still image of

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:20.218
that. Roth that was reference.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:24.022
What are known suspect please.

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:27.926
Yeah Joel book yes. A lot of

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.861
predictive analysis yet. The

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:30.461
recognition- you know I could

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:32.063
see at some point you know it

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.765
in twenty thirty years from now

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.767
you have a camera mounted and

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:36.267
you have photographs of

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.002
everybody that has an active

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:40.138
warrant and it automatically

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.773
scans the entire community.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:42.307
Points the people elected

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:44.142
boards I don't I don't think

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.777
we're definitely not there now

00:30:45.843 --> 00:30:48.213
and I don't think we would get

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.281
there in the future as well I

00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:53.918
think that's a little too. A

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.054
public consumption- and what

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.889
we- and I think that I would

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:58.489
leave that up to you guys to.

00:30:58.556 --> 00:30:59.991
Kind of stick a strategic look

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:00.592
and see how that. How that's

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:03.962
going to vault over time. So a

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:06.097
couple other kind of points to

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.166
make it in in some kind of the

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:10.201
A. I. F. today what we're

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:12.003
talking about my colleague

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.570
mentioned- the license plate

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.105
reader systems such more on

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:16.140
that a little bit- I think

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.942
that's probably the most

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.078
tolerated because it's not so

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:21.980
portion of personal it's your

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.315
vehicle's not necessarily your

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:27.919
face. That's being recorded.

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:28.486
Sometimes as offer a lot of

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.088
data and you do have you're the

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:32.156
concerns of how long to be all

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.858
that data and or we using that

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.960
data on the back and right and

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:36.427
currently it's not. A

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.029
predictive measure it's not

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:38.596
like we're tracking license

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:40.298
plates and saying that they're

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:41.933
going to particular place to

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.002
commit a crime we're not having

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:44.636
that. You know predictive alert

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.271
system. It's more reactionary

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.273
on the investigative side. Is

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:52.010
Hey we saw this vehicle how is

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:52.543
it that maybe that license

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.111
plate was in the area at the

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:56.114
time. Makes sense so. Actually

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.984
the current- a I. that's most

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:00.585
prevalent I think it's being I

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.220
don't it's- in the commercial

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.122
realm of you know what

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:06.124
advertisements to local law

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.992
enforcement is a voice

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.961
recognition- specifically and

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.063
the jail systems. Where we

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.232
record all the telephone calls

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.100
they go in and out of custody.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:19.971
And it does so you know they

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:20.571
don't have an expectation of

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:22.206
privacy and it does give a

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:22.840
warning on the front and saying

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:24.342
Hey this calls being recorded.

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:27.879
Eccentrics address so- but what

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:28.379
I technologies doing it

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.881
transcribing that and this

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.481
looking words so it's a key

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:34.319
words or sentiment. Is looking

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:38.356
for. No it are are we having

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.891
previously having. Bowl

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:40.525
indicators that there might be

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.160
an assault. Or it's also

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.895
picking up on maybe a motion

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:44.529
where it's saying this person's

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.197
depressed. And maybe they're

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.199
having thoughts of being

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:50.001
suicidal and then it would send

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.036
an alert to somebody within

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:54.172
custody. Saying Hey this person

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:54.739
is X. means point some open

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:56.140
perhaps you should have some

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:57.909
type of targeted intervention

00:32:57.975 --> 00:33:00.044
plan with mental services or

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:00.712
whatever it is I hueso. Kind of

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.046
two different ways that is

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.215
being used. One on the

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:07.885
investigative I'm and kind of.

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:10.121
Crime prevention side if you

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.023
were. But then also on kind of

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.060
more humanitarian- you know C.

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:22.100
need if well for. People that

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:22.700
are entrusted to us right so-

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.001
so that's kind of where we're

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:26.137
at- right now I mention that it

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:26.738
currently the Joel system at

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.306
least in my agency does not

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:28.906
currently use of that couple

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:30.274
voice recognition software but-

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.210
every once in while we do have

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:32.777
a company that tries to come

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.011
by. And say Hey we had we can

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:38.116
offer this- Bates it's a rather

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:38.716
expensive. I'm a lot of these

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.218
technologies are. So I'm but I

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:42.120
will say that I think as we

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.155
move into the future you know

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.023
we look at. What is it that- a

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.159
I. does for us and in an age

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:48.793
where we have to do more with

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.230
less- I think that it is a

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:54.332
natural step to say yes we

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.000
should be implementing these.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:56.601
Because we- the staff and you

00:33:56.667 --> 00:34:00.304
know it by. Double or triple

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.206
the size of. My analytical

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:04.008
team- to do crime analysis. I

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.244
would happily take it- but if

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.246
we can implement some of the

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.181
smaller technological solutions

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:10.782
hopefully that will kind of

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.150
offset. That need for the

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.118
increased I think so- I think

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:18.055
we need to use it but I think.

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:22.326
With that. I will say that I

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:26.230
think. In the age of big data

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:28.199
there's a lot of private

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:28.800
companies out there that are

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:30.234
collecting data and then it

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:32.336
just typically it's been on the

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.338
advertising or marketing side

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.007
you're getting all that data

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:38.109
and that's repackaged and then

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:38.709
sold to the government or law

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:42.013
enforcement for. An additional

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:42.647
use right and it's that kind of

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:46.184
a show use. Data set that for

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.019
me is a little bit concerning.

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:52.156
And I'll explain why so.

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:54.292
Currently we have you know

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:54.859
facial recognition we have

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.594
license plate readers and we're

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.096
using that and they're in

00:34:58.162 --> 00:35:00.164
different pockets if you will

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.033
and you're trying to compare

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.268
one data set to another. And I

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:04.836
think in the future it. What

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:08.172
were. Possibly looking at a it.

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:08.773
Is a large company buying up

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.210
despair data- and then

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:12.810
aggregating it from different

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:13.344
sources and then making a

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:16.447
pattern. What I see in the

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.216
future and I don't think it's

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.318
that far off. Maybe five or ten

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:24.121
years is you have- a company

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:24.755
like it let's just say it's a

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.457
grocery store or a regular

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.493
department store. There is

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.495
actively currently there's the

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.296
technology where they track

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:34.332
cellular devices within the

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.434
stores to be able to figure out

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.369
which I'll you're on what you

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:38.936
like to spend money on where

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:40.571
you're spending your within the

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.507
store correct. I'm and it's

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:46.143
don't for marketing purposes.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:46.777
If you then combine that with.

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.246
A facial recognition for the

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:52.250
CCTV camera and then maybe a

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:52.817
license plate reader at the

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.285
entrance to the store combining

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.354
all of the- data sets. I mean

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.122
you can get it really paranoid

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:00.124
and think about- the Bluetooth

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.326
sensor that measures your- tire

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.295
pressure gauge or Mr tire

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:06.130
pressure and sends it your car.

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:08.132
So you have very distinct

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.134
signals from different devices

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:12.236
whether to do your your your

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:12.770
cell phone or your- your

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.505
vehicle your face. You know

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:16.240
there's a lot of different data

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:16.841
that's collected there if you

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:20.311
aggregated in in total and then

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.480
you multiply it over- you know

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.415
either French doors or

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.317
different that same store maybe

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:26.884
it's a big change. How many

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.319
times they go on it at a into

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.121
this particular store and you

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:32.123
get a really good indication of

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:34.225
who your customer is and where

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:36.427
they live. Exactly when they

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:40.431
show up things like that and- I

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:40.965
think it's really good for

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:44.135
marking data. But I thought. I

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:44.735
would caution that you could

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:45.269
also use that if it's re

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:46.270
packaged and sold to law

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:46.938
enforcement say Hey or sold the

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:50.207
loss prevention. And say. You

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:50.841
know we've had this guy and he

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.510
committed a theft. Last year

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:54.579
and here's his entire history

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.314
and here's all of his devices.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.583
So as he comes on the property

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.585
now we have a license plate

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.420
reader blue to censor something

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:04.422
and saying Hey. This in that

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:05.022
stone from us before is now

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.457
approaching. This store now it

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:07.124
was in a store and he has face

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:08.459
recognition yes it's confirmed

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.528
it's him and now he has a cell

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.330
phone that. We know is.

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:16.667
Associate. With right. So that

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:20.404
type of. X. track something

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.005
that could put together in the

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:24.241
long run but- my question is.

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:26.143
As we move along with that data

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.744
I know on the law enforcement

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.379
side we're struggling to hold

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:30.681
all of our data and all of our

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:32.650
evidence or digital evidence

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.552
it's a huge undertaking but I

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:38.356
think the but sector and their

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:40.558
capabilities with that type of

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.360
data in the cloud or or power

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:46.297
they're stored in. That de is

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:46.897
able to make those connections

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:47.465
and when it's repackaged in

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:50.468
given. I've to be. Transparency

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.703
on sector is how it is they're

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.305
collecting their data- and

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:54.939
potentially how it is that the

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:58.442
re packaging or selling are

00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.076
analyzing it. And there's a lot

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:02.613
of. One of opportunity just to

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.382
solve crimes there but there's

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:04.782
also a lot of our

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:08.252
opportunities. For it to be-

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.321
yeah I was a misused but

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:12.323
repurposed with out the

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.258
understanding from the citizen.

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:14.825
That didn't know that just

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:16.661
going and going shopping was

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:18.362
going to be this big Joel

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.631
exhaust of the- that kind of

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:21.232
makes sense so. I'm so going

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:24.502
forward I think. A very large

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.237
amounts and I think you guys

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:28.339
have a very tough time to be

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:28.939
able to balance take all these

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.608
civil liberties and privacy

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.243
rights and everything else on

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.245
both the government side and-

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:34.812
you know what's commercially

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:38.482
available- and try to make it a

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:40.618
little bit more transparent as

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:44.355
to how it is that your data

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:44.955
gets. Into the systems. Was it

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.524
maybe you could. Or how can you

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.559
avoid it- even just today I

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:50.394
went in and something from a

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:50.995
store as paying cash and asked

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:52.363
me what your phone number. Well

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.265
okay why we need a phone number

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:54.832
to. Simple cash transaction

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.269
right there is a that data goes

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:58.836
and I don't know if there's

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.404
enough education on the public

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.440
side to be able to say Hey this

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:06.277
is when your data gets into the

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:06.844
system. And this is what it

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.279
could eventually be used for.

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:10.281
At you know it is it is what it.

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.516
Unions of people knowing at you

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:13.117
know who you are when you go

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.652
into a store and knowing your

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.620
history maybe it's easier to

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.522
return an item if you get my

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:19.156
phone number things like that

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:22.493
but- ultimately I think we have

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.729
to do to calm also look at the-

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.329
privacy rights of individuals

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.831
and say- you know. We're gonna

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:30.367
end up in the long run so is

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:30.935
before I absolutely think a

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:34.338
eyes we needed- within law

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:35.005
enforcement just because of the

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.741
nature of the cases that we

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.576
deal with. Us for crimes

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:40.444
economic crime there's a huge

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.045
amount of data that goes along

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.713
with. And we need help just

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.548
crunching it because we can't

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:48.452
look at that data individually

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:52.490
and make it that simple you

00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:56.627
know this person this because I

00:39:56.694 --> 00:40:00.397
saw on there. It is a- long.

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:00.931
Bill that we have to sort

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:01.432
through and- difficult.

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.767
Manually having that. And to be

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:03.400
able to do it. Is great but at

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:04.034
the same time we need to do in

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:04.835
that calculated measured way-

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:05.402
so that we are taking those

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:10.441
things into consideration so. I

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.443
believe it would at that for

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.445
now and in a little bit of

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.045
yeah. Thank you. Answer any

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.747
questions thank you. Sergeant

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.783
don't you you've hit upon a

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:20.818
number of different issues that

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.419
are before us right now.

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:24.722
Implicit bias issue privacy

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.724
issues- law enforcement in

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:30.528
terms of- refining our tools so

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.429
that we do a better job of

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:34.498
identifying. Of folks who are

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.567
wrong doers a couple things one

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.369
is it and I personally wrestle

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:38.969
with the- distinction between

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:42.673
data analysis. Which is so for

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.240
example you get a bunch of

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.775
phone numbers and you can you

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.811
know sort of analyze the- hub

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:50.381
in the spokes- versus

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:54.385
artificial intelligence which-

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:54.985
we'll get a better definition

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:56.387
I'm sure later on. The day of

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:56.987
where you have a system that

00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:00.591
actually. Makes decisions for

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:01.192
you give that system problem

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.693
and they come up with with a

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.728
solution of the problem as

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.430
opposed just gathering data- a

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.399
couple questions though

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:08.966
specific to your testimony.

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.501
You'd mentioned this voice

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:12.536
recognition technology of our

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:14.438
are there any jurisdictions in

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:15.039
California the that are using

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:18.375
it for example in the jails.

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:18.909
I'm sure that there are I

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.611
believe I. R. I don't know

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.780
which one off hand I'm sure

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.849
there are. Jurisdictions using

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:28.485
it- I could definitely. So I

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.119
would be usable when you could

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:32.389
let us know- I'd I'd be curious

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:32.923
as to if G. if there's any

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.792
jurisdiction using it. But the

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:38.762
outcomes are- who the vendors

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:40.731
are those those kinds of things

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:41.332
because that is sort of the

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:42.733
classic situation where you're

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.835
giving. The system an issue

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:48.539
identify for me those who are

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:50.574
depressed and here you go and

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.776
it comes up with. Some some

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:56.747
responses to that you know the

00:41:56.814 --> 00:42:00.784
river clear I think that. We

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:04.922
use it hi. I think Lara we need

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:05.556
to be. Of exactly how the data

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:06.724
is collected and how it's

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.525
analyzed. Behind the model so a

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:09.093
lot of the private companies

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:09.660
you know come out next they

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:10.261
want to sell your product and

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:10.995
say yes it does this and it's

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.696
this. A proprietary magic wand

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.698
and then makes this suggestion

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:16.600
this inference between. These

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.669
two data points it's inferring

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:19.303
this connection right based on

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.573
this key word and that. It

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.107
thinks that maybe you're

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.909
depressed in custody right. I'm

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:28.579
so having that human element to

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.179
be able to understand exactly

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:32.516
how the system works I think.

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.485
Develop a lot more credibility

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.119
really when you're looking at a

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:40.658
system. As. Instigated lead or

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.292
some type of. Action where you

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:42.960
are deciding to do something-

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:43.594
basically when we start talking

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:44.561
about when we go to court. How

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:45.229
is it that that system works we

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:46.630
can't just blindly trust a

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.766
machine to say yes you should

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.801
do this and- knowing where the

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:52.569
idea came from how it got

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:53.003
crunched. And then

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.772
understanding that logic and

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.974
your will to put into words and

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:57.508
ultimately into criminal

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:58.809
prosecution is. It's cute the

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.811
other issue that. Is of is

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:04.915
before us and is of interest.

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:08.786
Is this privacy. Concern. That

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:09.386
you mention so for example I

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.788
can see what the weather may be

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:12.856
implicit bias. If a store

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.758
identifies potential

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.827
shoplifters by your virtue of

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.729
where that person lives you can

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.798
identify either by cellphone or

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:21.432
by license plate you sell we're

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:22.900
gonna we're gonna track this

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.802
person because we think a

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:25.269
person comes from this

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:28.739
neighborhood is more likely to

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.641
shoplift. That someone else.

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:32.843
Honestly think it's based on

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:33.410
where they live but I think

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:33.944
it's based on their past

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:34.712
history. With their

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.680
relationship of knowing who

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:37.314
lives in their stone beds that

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.749
would be different but you

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:42.653
could use it. It if you were.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.122
If you're being more simplistic

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.890
by just. By just analyzing

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:50.627
where the person lives and then

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.796
making the leap. That that they

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:53.364
may be more inclined which

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.965
would be reflective of an

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:56.900
implicit bias in my view would

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.802
be. Inappropriate so anyway

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.938
that that's that's the that's

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:01.538
interesting issue that you've

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:02.940
identified also be interested

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.942
coordination and perhaps we can

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:06.677
do this offline. But

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.612
coordination between federal

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:09.113
entities state and local

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.048
entities that Beth is seems to

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:14.718
always be a- continuing- both

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.820
issue in tension between the

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:17.321
various law enforcement

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.689
agencies I can understand. Why

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:21.025
folks are sometimes reluctant

00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:22.893
to share for example the

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.494
confidential informants with

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.897
others because they're

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:27.364
concerned that. Press

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:30.768
information Mike it. Eight

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.736
either Edward Lear in it anyway

00:44:32.803 --> 00:44:33.303
so the so maybe we could do

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.638
that conversation another point.

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:36.907
Senate Chang. I have a ton of

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:44.615
questions. My I concur with the

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:48.619
good chairmen- with all the

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:49.219
issues that you touched upon

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:50.921
that's stop that we are

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.990
grappling with in Sacramento

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:56.827
currently- in fact when we're

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.695
talking about- privacy you

00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:00.931
know- there was last year we

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:02.800
passed the California consumer

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.768
privacy acts of C. C. P. A.'s

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:08.639
incredibly- yes right now it's-

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.607
the forefront of a lot of-

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.810
issues- the tech innovation

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.978
caucus members we actually

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:16.780
travel to DC. Was last week- to

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:20.751
talk about the need for kind of

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:24.788
an over arching- consumer

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:28.926
privacy- law at the federal

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:31.028
level- in California we're

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.963
still working on some of the

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.998
details because it's so complex

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.967
this is a complex issue- but I

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:40.737
am actually concerned now about

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:42.806
these private companies you

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:44.641
know these- data aggregators

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.977
now trying to sell data to law

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.079
enforcement and I feel like

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:51.048
there needs to be greater

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.916
transparency there because I

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:53.517
don't know what kind of data

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:58.956
there. Thanks. Sell you and

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:04.728
I'm- I'll talk. Later to see

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.864
what which Connie these are our

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.531
doing that because that it. Is

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.065
that we need to focus on

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:08.899
transparency and how that data

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.034
is gathered- and what kind of

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:14.872
data. But I also wanted to get

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:16.807
your thoughts on for example we

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.742
just passed a law it was AB

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.911
twelve fifteen which prohibits

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:22.946
law enforcement from installing

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.948
activating or using a biometric

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:27.050
surveillance system. That was

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:30.787
just codified and it has a

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:31.355
three year sunset so I'm not

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:33.223
sure if you have any thoughts

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.159
on. This matter is that the

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:38.729
same as the body worn camera

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:40.731
official recognition yes okay-

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:43.100
yes I might my thoughts on that

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:46.904
is I think we'll be. I think

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.939
it's a good step in the privacy

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.974
rights of people but I also I

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:54.745
kind of want to. Take it a step

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:55.345
away from looking at you know

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.047
we're we're at. To get ugly and

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.116
I have these two hats I'm a

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.817
really private person but at

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:01.451
the same time I want to solve

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.120
crime- and- I think there's

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:05.055
like a balance that they could

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:06.990
be made where. We're looking

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.959
at. You know the ability to.

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.961
Instantly identify or at least

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.829
get a pretty good idea as to

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:13.363
who somebody is. As a law

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.065
enforcement officer talks to

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:17.100
them. And I think there should

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.802
be a clear distinction that we

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:19.403
shouldn't be just randomly

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:21.071
scanning everybody on a body

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:24.808
worn camera however. I'm if we

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.743
have somebody lawfully detained

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.879
for investigation of a crime.

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:30.847
We should be able to use-

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:31.481
artificial intelligence to. By

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:32.916
who that person is. Whether I

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:35.319
take out my phone and I took a

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:35.886
picture and I sent to the

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.154
system. And it comes back as a

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.855
yes it's compared to this

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.523
booking photo we arrested him.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.325
You know a year ago and this is

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:42.960
his photo we can compare that

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:43.460
face to face. And get a

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.863
positive ID- I know our

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:47.397
department our department

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.266
currently is. Spending a lot of

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.936
money on mobile fingerprint

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:53.403
recognition or mobile

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.871
fingerprint identification

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.940
systems- and I would say that

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.842
probably the younger generation

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.944
who wants information now-

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:03.180
doesn't really want to wait

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:08.952
for. Finger to come Bob. Just

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:09.620
take a picture of me. I'll tell

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:11.221
you who I am right- so I think

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:11.855
there's a balance between. What

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:12.489
it is that's expected what the

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.257
community expects us to be able

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:15.158
to do- I think. In Mike overall

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.261
career I've talked to younger

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:19.162
generations that. Have been

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:20.998
really surprised as to what

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:23.033
we're not able to do- you know

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.068
they think that. It is a lot

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:25.702
more capability than what we're

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:28.939
actually able to do because we

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.941
have. Different silos of

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:33.143
information. So. Going back to

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.345
the face recognition I mean I

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:35.979
think. There could be a balance

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:38.882
there. And it could be a need

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:39.549
based on the level of detection

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:42.953
that we have rather than. Maybe

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.855
an outright I'm not saying no

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.857
to buy metric solutions-

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:47.457
deployed. If that makes sense

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:52.863
yeah and then going long lines

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:53.497
of transparency do you have any

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:55.198
thoughts on. Or any suggestions

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:57.301
for us on how how we can help

00:48:57.367 --> 00:49:00.871
maximize transparency. That's

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:02.873
going to be huge yeah I think-

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.473
you know in the future going

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.242
you know you so we started the

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.110
consumer privacy act or

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.912
whatever was in California- I

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.881
think it may be some. Very

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:11.515
clear language you know if you

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.250
go look at a company's- you

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.352
know privacy policy or terms of

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.421
service or things like that.

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:19.289
It's usually five ten fifteen

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:21.224
pages long and being able to

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:21.792
read through all that really

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.260
understanding what that means.

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:25.529
Is difficult sometimes and I'm

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:29.199
one of those guys that actually

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:29.766
reads those before you click

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:33.503
yes. Just to kind of see what

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.104
it is that that I'm that I'm

00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:34.638
getting right am I getting

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:35.272
myself into. There should be

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.274
like almost. Also like a

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.176
surgeon general's warning or

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:39.843
something like that but a very

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.478
clear message that says this

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.347
bird this company will collect

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:46.983
this information- if that makes

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.086
sense and then as we go

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:49.720
forward. Maybe just some public

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:53.156
out reach gonna some. You know

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:53.657
essays on you know how

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.325
information is collected well

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.227
more so from your department's

00:49:57.294 --> 00:50:00.997
perspective for. You know once.

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:01.465
Once the a eyes fully

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.133
implemented in terms

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:03.633
transparency from a law

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.302
enforcement perspective yeah I

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:05.836
think you know from a law

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.304
enforcement perspective I think

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:09.206
it's easy for us to say. This

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:11.141
is the data that we collect-

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:13.210
and we look at it and in

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:15.245
various ways- but being very

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:17.414
clear as to how we collect data

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.182
when we collected. And having

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.218
policies in place as to when we

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:23.086
purge that data. Is also very

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.188
very pertinent and that comes

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:25.789
back to you know when you look

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.391
at the intelligence system and

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.992
things like that we're looking

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:31.261
at twenty eight CFR. With the

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:31.762
collection retention and

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:35.332
purging of information I think

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:35.866
that is very a pretty good

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:41.204
model. Thank you. One final

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.240
question Mike. Co worker Mr

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.142
honest points out that he opens

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:45.642
his phone with facial

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:49.045
recognition in a as to any of

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:49.546
the four panelists I'm

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.281
wondering if that information

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.250
is been either offered to you

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:55.452
or if you're where where that

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.053
information is being sold to

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.089
law enforcement or other other

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.291
entities no I don't think it's

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.160
been you know sold on the- art

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:05.195
of use apple or Samsung or

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:05.762
whatever I don't think that

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.464
that is currently being sold I

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:11.067
don't think that Mr. The our

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:11.701
systems are set up it could be.

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.036
However I would say that I.

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:13.637
Probably unlock your phone by

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.338
showing your phone to your

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.374
face. So if you're looking at a

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:19.342
government ability to be able

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:21.144
to get into your device. Maybe

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:23.280
using your faces and- the most

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:31.087
secure way. Okay. Let me turn

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.223
to judge not camara- judge

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.459
Deborah I know you're you're

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.126
all busy people I know you're

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.260
particularly busy appreciate

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.362
you being here today to offer

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:41.331
your insights judge the floor

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:43.333
is yours well thank you for

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.103
inviting me to- explain what

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.105
our core is doing with respect

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:49.706
to artificial intelligence. Up

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:55.278
let me. Firstly thank you were.

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:59.015
So Bergen's etcetera Chang for.

00:51:59.082 --> 00:51:59.616
Allowing me to speak I'm very

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:01.384
proud of our- court you're

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.453
going to records were the most

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.288
technologically advanced

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.491
quartz- in the country. We have

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:09.626
the support of judicial council

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:11.428
as well as our chief justice

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.296
Connie sick seals talking you

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.365
whip who is a very much in

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:19.202
support of using technology. To

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:19.736
make our court system more

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:23.273
efficient and fair. We have

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.310
numerous projects in the tech

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.145
technology field that we have.

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:29.746
Going on and are pursuing let

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:35.218
me just try to. Gloss over some

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.287
of the rather mundane projects

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.189
that we have and then go in

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:39.789
more detail with respect to

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:41.625
some once I consider much more

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.326
interesting in terms of that. I

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:47.130
require more computing power in

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:47.697
an artificial intelligence.

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.533
Some of the more a lesser

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.434
projects or jury summons

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:53.436
management- we are exploring

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.372
using predictive analytics to

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:57.440
determine if we can better

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:59.309
manage your jury summons.

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.478
Obviously we have to make sure

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:05.215
that the this use of a I. does

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:07.384
not apply yes our jury panel

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.419
pools so that we have that we

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:11.521
represent all. When we pull

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:13.423
these soldiers in we're looking

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.260
to analyze historical data in

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:21.197
our case the U. lies juries. In

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.667
you a I M. machine wanted to

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:25.135
see if we can protect our need

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:25.735
for jurors so we don't have to

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.370
go. Pull as many jurors in for

00:53:27.437 --> 00:53:29.172
our jury trials. We are using.

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.608
Automatic we're trying to use

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.209
automatic redaction of

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:35.412
documents are filed with the

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.314
court we are very sensitive

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.249
with the documents that may

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.217
contain private information of

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:41.785
individuals such as social

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:43.453
security numbers and medical

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.392
data of when they file it we

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.026
were in the front. First courts

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.494
to use efile. So what we have

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:55.332
to use a certain level of. Of

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.534
US screen to make sure that

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.269
doctors should not contain

00:53:59.336 --> 00:53:59.803
private information that

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.571
otherwise all of the public

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.473
that can be used- for purposes

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.342
that are appropriate. With

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.510
respect to translation

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.479
obviously in our court system

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:11.247
we need certified translators

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:13.516
to translate- in a criminal

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.552
trial however. In our self help

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:19.623
us centers we can use machine-

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:23.526
translators- to help people

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:24.160
that would come and who we have

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:27.364
a legal problem. With three

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:29.265
they were did your levels

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:33.269
portals- we are working with.

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:33.870
The various police departments

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.639
to use. Electronic evidence

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:39.275
with respect to traffic cases.

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:41.478
With respect to- data exchange

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:45.248
we are also working with-

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:45.849
various other police agencies

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:49.486
to exchange data. In order to

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:53.256
better serve our public. Let

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:55.458
me- point out of three super

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.661
proud of projects I think there

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.396
are very interesting and are

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.698
more complex with respect the

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:03.266
use of artificial intelligence

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:07.404
first would be used to

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.971
artificial intelligence for

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.305
online dispute resolution.

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:09.839
Other various court I've

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:11.608
already use online dispute

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:15.278
resolution of both in the civil

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:15.879
and criminal contacts and you

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:19.482
in Utah- there is a limited use

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:21.584
of online dispute resolution

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.486
and small claims cases. Of we

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:27.524
are trying to. Interface with

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.392
the Utah court in order to use

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:33.263
some of their programs to-

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:35.265
perhaps implement an all white

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.267
dispute resolution. Our system

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.335
with respect to civil this may

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.438
require a certain number of

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:43.373
change of our laws because it's

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.542
understood that. Unless we make

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.377
online speed resolution

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.512
mandatory for let against it's

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.748
probably not going to be used

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:55.452
of very often. I'm I just be

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.086
resolution is being used in the

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.721
Michigan courts with respect to

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.756
traffic citations it with the

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:03.493
with. Very much success. That's

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.060
something that we're looking

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.495
into preliminarily. With

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:09.632
respect to. Trying to have

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.701
traffic cases resolved so

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.703
people do not have to come into

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.805
court and ultimately ever cases

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:19.442
tried. Another use of

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:21.511
artificial intelligence is

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.379
something I thought of in-

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:25.582
implementing our obligations

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:26.149
under Senate bill fourteen

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:29.619
thirty seven. Which is the

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:30.253
abrogation of the felony murder

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.590
rule with respect to fourteen

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:35.458
thirty seven that requires the

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:37.560
court to go through literally

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.629
in Orange County thousands of

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.196
cases. In order to determine

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:41.664
whether. People who were

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:45.368
convicted as in the success

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:46.002
rate of felony murder roles are

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:49.472
entitled to resend C. of these

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.407
cases are extremely voluminous.

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:53.777
And will require a considerable

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.779
out of either staff timer G.

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.781
full time to go through the

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.783
records in order to determine

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:01.618
whether the various elements of

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.653
which entitles a defendant to

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.421
be re sentence are satisfied.

00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:07.457
If we can develop. The

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:09.859
artificial intelligence program

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.661
which actually leans from the

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.396
record from these luminous

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.799
records the relevant documents

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.667
that would assist. The Trier of

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.736
fact the judge to determine

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.303
whether those elements are

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.771
present it so the defendant is

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.773
entitled to resend seeing this

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.377
could save our court hundreds

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.512
of thousands of hours a legal

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.146
researcher Clark hours in terms

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:33.817
of. Looking through of these

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:37.587
flumes transcripts. Our court

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:39.756
system is presently going to be

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.724
looking at S. B. ten of which

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.693
is a pre trial release program-

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.430
in lieu of bail that's- a

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.499
controversial situation there

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.634
is a- referendum out there the

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.703
trying to repeal SP ten

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.839
however. I at this point in

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:59.609
time we are proceeding- with

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:01.444
respect to our obligations to

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.479
determine whether there are

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.515
programs out there that will.

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:07.750
Valley predict whether we can

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:11.487
release defendants pre trial

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.556
without harm to the public and

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:17.560
with your high degree of

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.562
certainty they will appear for

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.497
a court appearance. I've looked

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:23.867
at the some of those brands

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.702
that are presently. Ben what

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.871
data. Of those programs I

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:29.505
believe are rather simplistic

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:30.106
they provide a- one point for

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.708
certain elements- at the V.

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:35.511
pro. Privacy be the- Virginia

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:37.580
tool. Has been validated for

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:39.616
the Virginia population- there

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:41.818
are various programs that are

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.820
being implemented by the

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:47.624
general counsel where. Grams

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:48.224
are trying to be validated for

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.559
population groups in

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.728
California. I feel that-

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.663
providing one point for each

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.632
one of these elements is rather

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.667
simplistic. If we can use.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:59.636
Artificial intelligence to give

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:03.506
a more specific number of

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:05.708
rather than one as opposed to

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:06.342
one point three one point four

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:07.644
depending on what the data. A

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.812
was support- we could be much

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.781
more precise in determining

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.583
whether we should release. Of

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.685
these defendants- pretrial

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.620
conditions we should use yeah

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.722
I'm releasing these defendants

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:21.658
in a pre trial- arena yeah so

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.693
we are required to do what

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.530
presently under Senate bill and.

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:29.732
I was told by a center Donora

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.634
we're trying to develop some of

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.503
these. Artificial intelligence

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:37.507
programs- with- UC Irvine. A

00:59:37.573 --> 00:59:38.107
one of those programs- mistral

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:41.878
is. Trying to assist the

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.880
suburbs of litigants to you

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:47.550
apply for protective order in a

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.719
domestic violence case so we

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.854
are- pursuing the situation

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.890
where we are using- artificial

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:57.660
intelligence to assist the-

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:58.294
suburbs litigants to- actually

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.731
apply. In a proper manner of

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:04.033
four of those types of orders.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.603
So one. It's an exciting time

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.672
of many of these programs are

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.674
absent are at their but it's C.

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:15.712
I would. Urge senators here

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.947
that so who would have proper

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.615
funding to the courts obviously

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:23.720
so low can pursue- these many

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.320
have a use which I think will

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.022
make our- court rooms much more

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.757
efficient. I think fair. Thank

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:31.928
you thank you judge not Grenier

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.830
I've had multiple discussions

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:34.364
about how we can make the

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.065
system to go still just system

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.967
more efficient a couple

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.969
questions you mentioned using

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.871
artificial intelligence or

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.840
some. System to. Dick I think

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:46.009
predict in terms of the jury

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:49.679
pool what what you may need to

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.681
be more accurate is it are you

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.683
currently using that system our

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.718
or if I develop a program that

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:56.219
does this all all these

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.854
programs are out there in the

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.922
C. right we are not presently

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:00.523
using any of these right now

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.858
these are projects that we are.

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:05.728
Not trying to prioritize with

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.229
respect to what's most

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.864
important the court in terms of

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.866
what we feel that we- would try

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.968
to provide the most. Bang for

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.003
our Buck so to speak you say we

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.805
are you talking about just one

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.707
case core you talking about the

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.709
mystery of all courts I'm

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.711
talking about they're going to

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:22.378
record. We're up we have one of

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:25.782
the largest the staff of

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.786
technology of people. Problem

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.988
for but once we develop these

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.956
programs obviously we're not

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.858
gonna keep them to ourselves

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:36.426
we're gonna sure eleven song

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.994
yes right we are new we form a

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.731
trial court. Go ahead we a lot

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:42.298
of these programs developed

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.699
royally without the court's and

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:44.300
we will share them with and

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.735
that to the extent that- we've

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.637
developed programs are

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:48.204
beneficial to other courts

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.039
around the state we certainly

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:51.974
will. What if are there other

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.709
jurisdictions outside of

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:54.243
California that that have

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.912
developed a methodology in

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:59.649
terms of- calling the jury pool

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:00.249
to be more efficient you know-

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.951
not that I know of okay because

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:03.986
of the wondering had they been

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.855
challenged you said in Utah the

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:08.057
using some sort of artificial

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:11.794
intelligence system force for

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.796
small claims. Online is

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.832
pollution is it is there being

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:16.432
involved there there are human

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:19.869
beings involved the some online

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:23.739
three resolution systems are

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:27.743
rather Henry it's just a

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:33.883
situation were offers. An

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:45.795
answer given yeah that's not.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:46.395
The value of the case and try

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:51.801
to suggest a- and number so to

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.003
select case I mean I think

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.139
these are it's one that we're

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:56.706
do you know where those are

01:02:56.772 --> 01:03:01.978
being used. I. th. I think the-

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.880
use the other countries to. I'm

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:04.480
not here they've been used in

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.115
the United States. I know that-

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.251
we- in terms of insurance Kerry

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.052
years they've been using these

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.754
types of artificial

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:12.288
intelligence predicted but

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:17.793
analysis programs for years.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.797
Days so we'll of they know eggs.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:22.431
Degree how much a case is worth

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.000
the based on certain factors

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.768
they put into their programs

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.937
and of this is what they allow

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:28.538
their defense counsel offer.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:34.277
Obviously. That trash and trash

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:35.878
out it's always good at sign.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:36.512
The fact is they put in. I hear

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.080
tell the that there are

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:41.751
programs that can for example

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:44.120
after- council received vents

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:45.855
cal's receives a complaint that

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:48.191
can spit out of demurrer for

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.293
example- up in it would seem

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:53.763
that if that's the case that

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.765
apps courts could look and see

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:56.365
whether that demurrer is valid

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.034
another words just look over

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.069
the complaints if all the

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.871
elements are. Properly pleaded

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.006
is that being used anywhere no

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:11.881
not really it. And again the.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.116
Color Jeff let the three bears

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.219
the judge to make the ultimate

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:19.889
decision there have been other.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.893
It's actually been cases of.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.928
Judges actually putting certain

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:30.032
factors in their decision that

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:32.101
ultimately gives a protective

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:34.103
decision for them to make an I

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:34.604
just basically allow the

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.272
computer to make that decision

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.974
and that was considered to be

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.541
an ethical because the judge

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.042
actually has to review the case

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.311
and make sure that that case

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:46.048
has specific. Factors that the

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:46.716
court has considered the vessel

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:48.184
with respect to the fourteen

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.952
thirty seven situation I'm not

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:50.553
proposing that ultimately we

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.221
put all the factors into a

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.925
court computer program- and

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.860
ultimately help that okay

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.929
recommendation it should be

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:02.164
only used to get the ribbon

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:02.732
information from these huge

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:10.139
files. Of. Huge amount time can

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:14.076
M. from the judge. Files all

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.312
right a law clerk eight related

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.180
legal research attorney so that

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.216
the time that's involved in

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:22.251
making that decision is very

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.053
very much abbreviated. So there

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.122
there's a new law effective

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:28.291
January one two thousand twenty

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:28.891
that provides the judges can

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.326
are the parties can stipulate

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:30.793
to- early exchange of

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.128
information analogous to

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.230
federal rule twenty six you may

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:36.198
have heard of this judge not

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.000
tomorrow yes I have a- and- a

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:41.871
well reasoned rule I mean well

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:44.006
thank you very much. And you

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:47.877
your query that that would be

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.046
something perhaps statewide

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:50.646
that the administrative also

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.348
courts may want to actually

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:55.985
take a look at to see. Who's

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:57.953
doing it what judges are

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.189
suggesting it what court rooms

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:04.260
is becoming more prevalent

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:07.930
whether that has any impact on.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:10.266
Exploiting cases Ben and

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.134
reducing discovery motions just

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:16.205
a thought judge so yeah thanks

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:16.839
for the suggestion I think it's

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.374
very good one. Thank you Senate

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:22.478
Chang. Thank you I'm I just

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.080
want to go back to what you

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:24.680
were saying about the traffic

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:30.252
tickets was that. The A. R. A.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:34.156
I. being used and- well yeah

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.258
again there's a. They're still

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.527
human element in online dispute

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.363
resolution at prickly when it's

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.064
Bates when it's done in in

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.066
Michigan what's happened is

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.035
that certain citations are.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.404
Issued by the traffic officer

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.573
and a proposed a- resolution of

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:54.009
that. Is ultimately given up

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:56.011
why a judge or a trick attorney

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:56.612
with respect that usually at

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.347
something much less than what

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.049
you potentially could be. In

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.284
terms of the fine. I and that

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.320
that's offered to. Of the

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.322
defendant of the person who

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.424
made. The vial allegedly made

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.292
violation and they have the

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:14.130
opportunity to either accept

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:18.033
that or eventually go to trial.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.236
So that's how in that's

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.338
resolved quite a few of the

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.039
various at least in Michigan.

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.008
Citation they have their

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:26.575
because but many times the

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.444
offer made by the judge or the

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:34.283
DNA is. Does not Derick choir a

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.085
point being placed on that the

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.187
defendant's record so what's

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.523
the a large enticement for that

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.324
defended the to accept that

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.460
offer as opposed to go to trial

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.429
and risk I having a point. Or

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:48.197
two placed on there. There's a

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.332
record so you mentioned there

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.067
isn't a human element and

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:52.701
there's definitely going to be

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.403
human element in any type of

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.937
technology that has been

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.105
created. But the algorithm that

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:58.674
is. Being constructed for this

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.376
traffic taking I'm kind of

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.077
curious about it because how

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.346
would that look like so is it

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.282
just not even. You don't even

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:06.849
have to appear in court is

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.350
that. Well a lot is the

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.453
resolution basically is the

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.388
ultimate goal is that people

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.190
don't appear in court and

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:18.160
they're given an offer. Us so

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.563
that the they don't high enough

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:24.099
so that they would. I believe

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:26.469
that the it's better for them

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:27.036
to take that off for us to

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:28.571
post. Your court yet let's take

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:34.376
an example of. It's a the

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.145
speeding ticket this this is

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:36.712
mission Jim because that's

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.180
where where they have this. And

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.583
it possibly can give you two

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:44.253
points and it could. Be a fine

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.123
of two three hundred dollars

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:48.724
which is a lot less and would

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.159
be in California but as we know.

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:50.793
Ultimately the judge might look

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.263
at the file and Mike. Might

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.432
ultimately say that this person

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.367
I'm a record of all prior

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.369
violations. Of I will offer

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:02.438
this person a traffic school

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.406
hundred dollars no points and

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:04.974
at that point in time that

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.375
person can make a decision

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.410
whether to contest that

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.346
particular citation in court or

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.381
take that offer. So that's how

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.216
that would ultimately you work

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.418
in that type of situation that

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.287
the in California the fines are

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:22.391
much higher- so we're gonna

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:28.264
want to show up in court. Right

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.199
so that's why I'm kind of

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.468
curious as to what how that

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:33.102
will help that's how it works.

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:38.140
Okay interesting. Can I and I

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:38.707
just want to comment that I

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.142
completely agree with you that-

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:44.213
assigning just one point- in

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.115
terms of what Virginia's doing

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:48.384
is a little bit too simplistic

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.219
and yes there's like seven

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.221
certain seven categories like

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.390
white one point four and it it

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.292
it just brought me is a very

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.360
simplistic way to determine

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.129
whether somebody should be-

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.164
release pre trial or not I

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.333
think we need something more

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:04.934
precise. Absolutely thank you

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.372
so much. Thank much. Up next we

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:14.410
have a senator don senator

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:16.278
slash dean's Lynch council done.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.547
Seller Dodd floors yours I

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.148
thank you Mister chair- first

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.583
let me extend my personal thank

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.284
you along with my fellow

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:22.851
panelists to- the chair to

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:24.420
senator Chang your respective

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.288
staff to the Senate staff-

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:26.956
because I know as you indicated

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.424
Mister chair- going on the road

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.024
with the hearing is a logistic

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:32.361
nightmare obviously for the

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:32.995
great staff and then of course

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.363
here again. Thank you to

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.300
sergeant arms or here as well

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:38.934
to whom I've known for a very

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.603
very long time and it's great

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:44.239
to see them here as well and

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:44.740
now some of the greatest

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:45.240
professionals I've ever

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:48.477
encountered. I do have to

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:50.679
extend a- an apology on behalf

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.247
of the original designated-

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:52.815
speaker for this role and

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:54.617
implicit bias professor from

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:58.253
UCLA and fortunately she- was.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:58.854
Taken down with the flu last

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.456
night it sends her her sincere

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:04.226
apologies for having to. Cancel

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:06.662
and- I get the lucky task of

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.530
stepping into her shoes. With

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:12.234
great honor- I'm gonna take a

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:12.868
slightly different approach to

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.536
this is the issue of implicit

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.672
bias you know particularly as

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.307
it relates to- application law

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:22.311
enforcement and judiciary- and

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.246
take a very practical approach

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:24.813
to it. But a little bit of

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.350
background first- I come to it

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:28.884
really in in two different

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:34.323
roles- as special adviser to

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.957
our dean song Richardson at the

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.592
UCLA school of law. And as many

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:40.262
of you know- she has been very

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.431
public about. Jean you see I

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.032
by- so one of the top twenty

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.266
five plus schools in the

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.602
country. As one of the first

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:48.570
within the law academia bill

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:52.508
breaks hi and in her words in

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:58.614
the DNA. Of the law school on

01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.181
his Beth great honor to work

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:04.586
with her. It in that process

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.689
that is well under eight out.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:10.292
I'm also here- and the role I

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:10.859
serve as chair of a national

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.561
foundation. These projects.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.630
Your views projects mission is

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:15.164
to eliminate child sexual

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.532
exploitation and all of its

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.333
forms on a global basis- and

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.402
you'll see why that role that I

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.271
share- is gonna come into play

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.273
a relatively quickly here. Of

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:26.275
so one it just share a little

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:26.942
bit about what we've been doing

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.644
in zero abuse because I'm gonna

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:29.244
keep going back to it- as it

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.347
relates to implicit and

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:32.848
explicit biased in a I.

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.583
applications we have been two

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:38.420
years- it zero views project-

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.021
and we own the intellectual

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.491
property to it. To building in

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.125
a I. platform that is focused

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.695
on- identifying sexual

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.464
predators of children. The

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.599
prototype is built on what we

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.367
refer to as institutional

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:52.868
sexual abuse of children

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:54.703
meaning abuse inside of an

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.705
institution academia religious

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.807
sports whatever the institution

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.776
may be. And we've been working

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.377
in collaboration with local

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:02.978
national and international law

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.646
enforcement agencies with

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.615
respect to it we're two years

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.650
in we're about to reach what's

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.352
called minimum viable product

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.521
with- which is years simplest

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.490
form that it's ready to for

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.458
deployment- literally in about

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.494
two weeks- it's been a long

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.763
process. I learned the hard way

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.731
about a I. and billion a I.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.600
platforms through that process

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.668
again and thank you to our

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:28.604
outside company that's been

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:29.171
building which is local. In

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.639
Irvine techno says a

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:34.476
tremendous- talent talent- that

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:38.380
they brought to it- the premise

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:40.449
of the platform simply is it

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.384
observers C. externally

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:46.722
observable. Behavioral patterns

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:52.427
of an institution. Termin if

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:52.961
the institution itself is

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.596
hiding sexual predators of

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.465
children inside. Focus is not

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:57.065
on the predators and it's not

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.767
on the survivors such victims

01:13:58.834 --> 01:13:59.334
it's on the behavior of the

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.569
institution itself. If you can

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.871
collect enough data on the

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:03.338
externally observable

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:06.608
behavioral patterns are and

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:07.142
know what those patterns-

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:10.546
means. You can then in essence

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.447
on cover a cover up inside of

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.716
eight institution. Our it's no

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.852
surprise that there are some

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.587
well known institution of

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.556
struggled with this issue for

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.891
decades- the Catholic Church of

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.760
course the Boy Scouts and now

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.695
we're beginning to see in

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.831
academia. The end the Olympic-

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.732
world- many sports programs

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.701
unfortunately the list is very

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.570
very long. This is the key

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.638
investigative tool for long-

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.874
intended for law enforcement on

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.843
has no a I. application

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:44.479
actually dictates anything we

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.715
should all view output of any

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:48.784
I. platform. Is simply a tool-

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.586
some valuable information- that

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:54.690
should lead to in. Other law

01:14:54.756 --> 01:15:00.529
enforcement contacts other.

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:02.698
Traits investigation it's not a

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:03.298
Beall and all conclusion but

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.766
helpful in a variety of

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:08.704
circumstances. Of the when that

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.338
platform goes live you will not

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.572
be made public- it will just be

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:11.039
available to academic

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:11.607
researchers law enforcement

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.710
exedra- in the a prototype-

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:18.580
it's eight an institution that

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:19.248
has had this problem for a very

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:22.651
long time there are. Thousands

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.720
of known predators of children

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.588
that have served in a

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.189
institution and many that have

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:32.561
not. Come to the light of day

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:34.696
and our goal is to take the

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.732
known- predators compared to

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.800
the database on the rest of the

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.636
individuals employed by that

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.638
institution. And see if we can

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.573
determine other predators- we

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.875
think that number of other

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:47.409
unknown predators to the

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:50.612
public. Sadly is quite large

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.581
consequences are huge- on

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.716
average a sexual predator of

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.752
children before here she is

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.921
taken away from any access to a

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:01.056
child. Usually has abused fifty

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:04.526
or more kids before they're

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:05.093
actually caught the numbers

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.563
are. Staggering. Excuse me. So

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.699
let me move into a practical

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.668
examination of how bias

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.870
Blissett and explicit get into

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:18.607
any I. platform. It's not a new

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.742
phenomenon we all know of the

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.811
concern about biased in a I.

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:26.615
applications- it's not a new

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.817
phenomenon and- the tech world

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:29.451
been aware of it from her for a

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.819
very very long time. How to

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.955
resolve it is a much more

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:36.525
difficult issue- there's a lot

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:37.092
of rhetoric around bias the

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:40.629
issue biased in a I.

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.831
applications- frayed at least

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.633
in my humble view the rhetoric

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.535
isn't necessarily on track.

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.971
Every a I- application has buys

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.939
in because it was created by

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:54.676
humans and we all have it. So

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:55.277
even though there's some that

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:58.714
want to argue with that- C. a

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.716
law enforcement platform- which

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:01.316
deliberately dot bias against

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.818
this community or that

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:03.418
community. None of them were

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:06.688
built that way- it's simply

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.690
inherent if you understand. The

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:11.059
build out of an A. I. platform

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.828
isn't defended or make it

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.830
right. But it's a very

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.732
complicated question and I

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:17.199
think for all of us

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:18.967
particularly you as Sanders as

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:24.639
policy makers. Of to ensure-

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:25.107
understand for all the

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.908
legislators that this is a

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.744
complicated question despite

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:34.750
all the rhetoric it sits. There

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:35.283
in particular in the media

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:40.922
space. I'm. I want to share

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:41.523
something wish I could claim

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.691
credit for this I can't- but

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.726
probably drives the point home

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.628
we all know what the cost of

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:47.262
any I. platform is an algorithm

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.864
or algorithms- and is often

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.932
times said by many far more

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:51.566
knowledgeable in the eyes and

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:52.801
I. Is an algorithm is simply

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:53.435
someone's opinion wrapped up in

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.870
computer code. It's a great

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.638
very laypersons definition

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:57.205
it'll be the humor in there.

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:58.707
But there's a lot of truth to

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:02.811
it- because when I develop a

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:03.378
premise for any I. platforms

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:06.848
really my opinion. Is wrapped

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:07.416
up by the tech folks in in

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.884
computer jargon I can use that

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.886
technical term- and if we keep

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.621
that in mind when we think

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.790
about bias in the I. that's a

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.625
truism for almost every a I-

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:18.827
application. That we see in the

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.629
public or private sector- today

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:21.229
including law enforcement the

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:24.800
judiciary as as well to. The

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.935
challenge however is for the

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:27.569
average person on the street-

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.204
many studies have shown. They

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.106
trust the conclusion that came

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.941
from a computer. More than

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:36.745
they'll trust. An individual-

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:37.379
perhaps the most common example

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.947
is this is Google maps. We've

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.984
all encountered a Google map

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:43.618
direction that says go this way

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:48.757
and you go. I just know that's

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:50.725
wrong. But 99% of people will

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:51.359
ignore their own experience and

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.061
trust what the computer says.

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.729
When in fact the computer can

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:55.397
do harm to- and so you start to

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.099
merge this opinion issue.

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:58.900
Wrapped up in code with an

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.802
inherent belief a computer is

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.737
always right by the public.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.806
You've got a recipe for real

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.741
challenges here because-

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:07.275
implicit biases in every

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:08.977
platform but if the public is

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:11.012
going to assume the conclusion

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:11.646
from a computer is right. We

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.148
got a child. That's a big

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.083
challenge there. So how does

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:20.755
bias in- a I. applications come

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.958
in to be. And this is where I

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.759
want to get very practical-

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.995
and- I'm going to generalize

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:29.131
here so if we have any a I.

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:29.698
experts in the audience of

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:32.734
bristle at this but- it's a lay

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.870
person's way of looking out the

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.738
build out. Of an A. I.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:39.040
application. To see how black

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.243
by it's gets introduced at many

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:45.013
of the stages- and this makes

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.848
it very difficult as- C. make

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.950
yours. And how do we wrestle

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:54.789
with issue when bias can be.

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:55.423
Inserted into an application at

01:19:55.490 --> 01:20:00.996
many levels. We all have

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.898
different definitions of a I.

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:03.498
R. machine learning the tech

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:03.965
industry doesn't like

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.066
artificial intelligence they

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:05.634
prefer machine learning for

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.935
lots of good reasons- us Leyva

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.970
folks. Are just comfortable

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:09.571
with artificial intelligence

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.106
which is probably more of a

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:11.640
Hollywood label than it is

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.941
anything else. But at its

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.043
simplest form- is a I. machine

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.012
learning is an algorithm that

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.014
the tax patterns in big data

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.216
sets. That's basically what it

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.318
is in its in its simple and

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:26.955
less funny way. But

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:29.157
unfortunately it picks up

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:31.126
patterns that yeah are in a

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.128
database that a human created

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:35.163
therefore there's lots of

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.934
places that the- bias can can

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.568
surface. We know it's a well

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:42.938
known problem we know that a I.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.873
algorithms can perpetuate bias

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.008
and justice whether it's in the

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:48.877
hiring process many of us know

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:51.012
the now infamous episode of the

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:53.014
Amazon hiring process- in which

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:55.016
they wanted to figure out. Who

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.118
were the best candidates for

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.120
application that would fit

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.256
within Amazon and they based it

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.258
upon- create a database of

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:06.928
their past out of hiring. Of

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:07.462
technical folks were very

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:12.968
successful at Amazon. The

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.869
unfortunate- problem was the

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:15.403
they turned it off pretty

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:16.004
quickly. The is it recommended

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:16.871
hiring a lot of people who look

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:17.405
like me and not very many

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:21.142
people. Gender race or

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:21.776
otherwise that didn't look like

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:27.282
me. It step that was a pretty

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.317
high profile on the situation

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.219
Monning many- it's shown it you

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:32.988
see it all it is C. the bias

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:33.488
and retail applications

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:37.192
security and law enforcement

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.893
issues Cannella justice system.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.129
Every place a I. is use which

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.931
is almost every industry- in

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:45.233
society. Has a bias issue in

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.302
it- I don't think anybody would

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:49.204
stand before this committee and

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:50.872
say I have any I. application

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:51.473
that is zero bias. It doesn't

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:56.878
exist. So to look at the build

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:59.047
out of a I. platform you just

01:21:59.114 --> 01:21:59.681
from a labor of perspective is

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.116
just three stages. It's what's

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:04.886
called the framing the issue

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.888
and requirements phase median

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.890
what you want to accomplish.

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:09.524
And what does the roadmap look

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:13.161
like for us the technical folks

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:14.896
in the subject matter experts

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.898
what's the road back look like.

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:17.465
To get to the end conclusion

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:22.904
you want to cheat. On ours your

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:23.471
abuse platform we wanted to

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:24.973
identify unknown predators of

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:25.540
children inside institutions

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.075
that was a promise. What's the

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.244
roadmap to get there on the

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.046
institution we picked to build

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.883
the platform on the prototype

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:35.383
we needed subject matter

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.918
experts about that institution.

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:40.889
A I tech experts by themselves-

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:41.489
they can create a lot of fun

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.391
stuff but if we want to solve

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.293
problems you need to join them

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.895
with subject matter expertise.

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:47.495
In the case of our presiding

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:53.068
judge you need judicial experts

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:53.668
to talk with the A. I. experts

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:57.172
to build platform. Well in that

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:57.806
for please call the requirement

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.307
phrase- you can introduce bias

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:03.011
quite unintended. And we've

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:07.015
seen this lenders will have.

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.983
Bill many different M.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.551
locations but let's ask what

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:11.086
the mission is. If it's to

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:15.256
increase profits. Or is it to

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:19.194
increase repayment- percentages

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.162
both depend upon how that

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.696
lender will define credit

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.367
worthiness. But if it's not a

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.168
specific definition connected

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:29.404
to that particular goal I just

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:29.938
one increase profits of my

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:35.009
company. You can enter to bias

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:37.178
in simply defining a word in

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:41.116
that requirement face. I'll

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:41.716
parole risks there's a number

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.184
of a I. applications that are

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:47.021
trying to create. A I. analyses

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:49.224
on the parole risk of someone

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.126
who's about to be released. How

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.428
do you define risks. Is that

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.397
Rhys median likely to commit

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:59.000
another crime. That wrist

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.002
meaning likely to be calm

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.171
dependent upon state resources

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:03.772
for survival without committed

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:07.108
a crime. If you define it only

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:07.642
in one way but use it for

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.110
different mission you're going

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:11.212
to introduce by us and you

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:11.813
haven't even started to build

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.183
your database. Buyers can speak

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.352
there- we had to be very

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.120
specific on zero abuse pop form

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:21.322
on what did we want to

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.291
accomplish in their- folks

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:27.095
thought when they help from. We

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:27.729
presented to the U. N. twice on

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:31.366
the platform. Were we trying to

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:33.234
predict predators of that was

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:33.802
the initial response in the

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:37.071
answer is no. We don't do

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:37.672
anything in our database- and

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:41.009
our platform about the predator

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:41.509
all about examining the

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:45.013
institutional behavior. But if

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:45.513
you mix the two in your

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.147
requirement phase you're going

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:49.083
to get by. The second phase in

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.019
probably in most applications

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:53.154
the most complicated phase a

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:53.755
most difficult is building the

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:57.158
database. That is a very

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:57.692
challenging problem more

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.093
challenging than we thought as

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.196
we built this platform. On a

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:01.763
particular institution where

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:02.263
there's lots of publicly

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:05.500
available data. But just that

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:07.535
building of the database phase

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.437
can introduce lots of different

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:13.508
components of. Bias X. implicit

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:17.545
or explicit. Of so let me give

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.481
you a couple examples if your

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:23.117
data is incomplete you're going

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:25.186
to get some pretty biased

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.155
outcomes let me create a

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:27.755
hypothetical is loosely based

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:31.226
on a real life situation. I'm a

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:31.726
company that's trying to

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.294
develop self driving cars. Well

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.296
one of my challenges is tech

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:37.198
team to train the car. To

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:37.732
identify a pedestrian in a

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:41.569
crosswalk. Pretty obvious risks

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:45.240
for any driver obviously. And

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:49.344
so to do that I go to my tech

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.312
folks how are we going to train

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:53.147
the card to identify pedestrian

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:53.715
it to stop or to avoid that

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:54.215
pedestrian that's in the

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:57.285
crosswalk. Well in all

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:57.886
likelihood of all of the tech

01:25:57.952 --> 01:26:01.122
folks who are designing the

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.723
pedestrian issue in the build

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:05.126
out look like me. Of what

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:07.295
happens is the card gets

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:07.762
trained to stop for a

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:11.132
pedestrian that. Looks like me

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.268
but unfortunately. And it

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:13.801
really happened number two

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:17.405
years ago. The tech folks

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.440
didn't intend any bias at all

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.509
but because of how they created

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:23.478
the database and we're training

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.346
the application it wasn't

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.382
complete database it could not

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:29.551
identify different gender than

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.286
me a different race than me

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.354
different heritages me. So I'm

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:35.557
safe in the self I. in cars

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:37.258
because I'm white male

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:39.394
everybody else not so much.

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.396
Obviously when they discovered

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:45.266
the problem they had to go back

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:45.900
to the drawing board but that's

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:49.270
an incomplete data set. On a

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:49.904
very critical issue that all of

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.472
a sudden the technicians didn't

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:55.176
mean to have a biased outcome.

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:55.810
But it ended up by this outcome

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:59.380
unfortunately. I we already

01:26:59.447 --> 01:26:59.948
talk real briefly about the

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:00.515
Amazon situation predictive

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:03.451
policing. Lots of rhetoric

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.486
around a concept predicted

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.388
Ripley scene nobody's really

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:07.889
come up with much of a

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.357
definition but we got the

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:11.259
public debate over its got

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:11.826
privacy implications bias

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.394
implications all kinds of

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.530
implications. We come up with

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:17.332
if we agree upon the definition.

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.434
But often times predicted

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.536
please scene type platforms as

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:22.136
they've been called are based

01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:27.375
on incomplete data. And if you

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.310
have that predictably seen a-

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:29.944
application may end up focusing

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:33.314
on a particular community a

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.316
particular type of person- and

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.585
only focus on those and just

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:41.289
perpetuate the bias and it's

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:41.889
all started from an incomplete

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:43.424
thought about the base. How you

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:47.261
prepare the database. Now

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:47.862
before you put the third phase

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.697
which is putting the A. I. he's

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:51.699
on to the database which is

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:55.269
often times the most simplest

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:55.837
process of the whole process

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:57.472
interestingly enough- how you

01:27:57.538 --> 01:28:01.576
prepare it- in our- database

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:03.378
for zero abuse project. We had

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.246
to figure out what the flags

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.248
were of that institution

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:11.352
behavior that indicates that

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:11.886
there is they're hiding a

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:12.320
predator inside that

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:15.256
institution. Well developed red

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:17.525
flags- we found for the subject

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:17.992
matter experts on that

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:19.360
particular five platform. They

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:23.264
had a list of red flags of how

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.366
the institution handled folks

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:27.468
inside that seem to indicate

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:27.969
that they institutional

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.537
concluded was predator of

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.472
children. Of. Their own

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:37.278
inherent bias in they'll- our

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:37.845
it seemed to be an object of

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:38.479
issue and it turned out to be a

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.681
subject. We haven't even gotten

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:43.384
to train. Platform yet- that

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.018
these are just examples of how

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:49.390
bias can does begin in the face

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:50.024
to for most a I build out which

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:53.561
is. Getting a workable

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.596
database. Of I'm gonna use some

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:56.164
technical terms and they're

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.732
only ones because I'm not a

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:59.567
technical guy- in our situation

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.436
which is often times the case

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:03.504
you have to take the raw data

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:07.442
and person code. Meeting you

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.610
you pretty to a format that's

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:10.244
readable and workable in Exeter

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:13.715
up. Of how you parsing code get

01:29:13.781 --> 01:29:17.618
introduce bias into your

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:21.489
platform never intended- in our

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:23.591
situation we found that- as we

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.493
are perceiving coding would

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.428
seem to be just. Addresses and

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:29.630
street names and states and

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.231
accept or something seemingly

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:35.503
objective. Interestingly enough

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.104
our own decisions about that

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.572
part how to parsing code with

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.540
the technical team ended up

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:40.108
introducing some potential-

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:41.876
bias into the process. And then

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.377
of course your face three which

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.379
is adding the A. I. application

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:47.381
to it- that's where you train

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.650
the A. I. aspect of it on what

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:55.389
you want to accomplish because

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:55.923
in a I. platform can't do

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.524
anything on its own it has to

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:59.761
be trained. What does though is

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:00.294
it then moves from a kid a

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.662
gardener. He we take twenty

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:02.263
some odd years as humans to do

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.865
that. And take a matter of days

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.366
to go from kindergarten level

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:07.668
to a PhD level on whatever the

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.537
subject matter is. And then

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.606
start connecting dots that the

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:12.173
human mind can't see inside

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.610
that database. Okay but now

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:17.779
let's go to the issue how do

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:18.446
you fix implicit bias is a well

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:19.547
known problem- it's just the

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.482
extent of how implicit bias

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.651
gets into an A. I. application

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:24.285
again whether it's judicial law

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:27.388
enforcement. Private sector

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:28.022
retail whatever the case may be

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.459
it's all. The same. Of and

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.394
again I'm ignoring those folks

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:34.028
who deliberately designed by S.

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.530
A. I. platform that's a whole

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:37.698
different problem it's the-

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:41.402
unintended. Bias that is really

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:41.969
the challenge for us as a

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:43.638
society from my perspective.

01:30:43.704 --> 01:30:47.375
There's that hotfixes obviously

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:47.942
the Amazon hiring situation

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.710
they all my gosh. We're not

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.379
getting very many women-

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.748
identified qualified applicants

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.516
through this process so the

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:56.150
immediately go to die okay we

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:59.387
have to eliminate. Explicit

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:01.489
gender works for example women

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:03.624
applicant list. College

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:05.560
activity women's swim team.

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.895
Phone that thing got rejected

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:13.601
by the email Amazon apple.

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:14.235
Because there weren't very many

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:15.803
women says swim team- folks

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:16.404
wouldn't hire the past because

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:19.607
everybody look like me. I'm

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:20.174
overstating a little bit so

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:20.741
Amazon doesn't get a little

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:23.744
upset about that. They thought

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:24.345
they fixed it but the A. I.

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:25.680
application learn so fast and

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.481
also picked up from the past

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.483
database of applicants that

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:30.084
there are certain words that

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.919
tend to surface on application

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:35.523
submitted by woman versus a man.

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.491
Not the obvious word of a

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:38.125
women's swimming team. But how

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:39.827
things are phrased whether

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.662
right or wrong it had concluded

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:42.296
from the tap bass database that

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:45.733
in fact. There is a subtle

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.535
difference in language use on a

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.637
resume and accept our so went

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:50.137
to an implicit level and

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:51.639
rejected the application. So it

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.841
gets really complicated Amazon

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:57.612
of course never intended to be

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:58.112
biased in its it's a I.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.749
platform. But it happened both

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:02.283
explicit and implicit so

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.684
there's that hot fixes when you

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.653
identify the bias in the source

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.588
of the problem but that's just

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:09.490
ad hoc after the fact- fact.

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:11.492
The more the sing surface

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.159
without getting caught ahead of

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:15.496
time the more the public's

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:15.963
faith. Goes down. And

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.734
rightfully so. You can bill

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.702
detection systems- most a I.

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:22.203
platforms are built for

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.703
performance not for bias

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:25.840
detection. You can build in

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.875
there are a I. platforms under

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:31.812
development of can a I identify

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:35.616
its own bias. Whether those

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:36.250
will work we'll see- there are

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.652
some who are debating whether

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:38.252
in the requirements phase to

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:41.822
we- require a platform in the

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.925
it's its creators to define

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:47.561
what absence of bias looks like.

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:48.095
The problem so let me just

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.597
finish with the following. It

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.799
will say from a public policy

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.801
perspective that's probably

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.870
where most of the work is being

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:59.507
done on how to deal with bias

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:01.676
in the I. platforms. Could in

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:03.611
law enforcement judicial which

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.245
is so critical to function in

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:07.515
society. I think we can be less

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:09.517
concerned if I'm selling pet

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:10.117
rocks and trying to figure out

01:33:10.184 --> 01:33:10.618
as a more through any I.

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:13.788
application. But there is

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:17.525
great. Being done on the policy

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:19.627
lawn ethics surrounding bias in

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.194
eight I but a lot of folks

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.798
aren't aware of that- lot of it

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:25.666
is on accountability issues

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:26.267
responsibility issues ethical

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:29.537
issues and etcetera and I'll-

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:30.171
not leave it vague- the United

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:31.939
Nations and several of its

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:33.941
agencies. Are doing great

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.843
international work in this area

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.712
it's been an honor to work with

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.714
us some of those agencies. From

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.016
UNESCO- to the I. T. you know

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.951
most people have no idea what

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:45.619
that is that's the oldest of

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:46.187
the agencies in the United

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:47.822
Nations stands for

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.623
international.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.692
Telecommunications union not

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:53.961
union as we see the word union

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.963
but- store clean- it's been

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.665
around actually for over a

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.867
hundred years but it became the

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:03.804
first. U. N. agency they deal

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:04.372
with all the technicians the

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:10.077
policy. One we're working with

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.679
his unit Cree that stands for

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.614
the United Nations inter

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:15.616
regional crime. And research

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:16.217
Dodd- justice institute I get

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:17.818
that right and maybe off just a

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.720
little bit- they're doing great

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.922
model policy work on- setting

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.958
up. And via a barriers along

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.693
the roadways as far as

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.327
developing a I. in minimizing

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:27.795
the risk of a I. number of

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.797
trade associations that have

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.632
many of the big tech companies

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:32.199
are working on this. They're

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:33.901
trying to find a fine balance.

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.970
Many at the public level don't

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.738
think that balance is a knife

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.740
towards eliminating bias

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:40.341
they're trying to find a nice

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.976
balance of still makes for

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:45.713
work. A I. apple turns but- at

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.648
the same time Bates minimizes

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:48.215
much as Italy's practically

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:49.984
possible. A long ways to go

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:50.518
unites these government of

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:52.086
course is doing some states are

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:56.057
doing. This this committee of

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:59.660
course it is falls into that.

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:01.862
Thank problem the two areas

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:02.463
that are most focused on right

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:06.067
now on the issue of bias in L.

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:08.035
A. I. applications. Our

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.770
transparency and explain

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:10.371
ability those two words- and

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:11.872
how do we require the president

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.641
let me just interrupt you just

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.776
for second we made certain

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:16.277
representations of the

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.012
panelists the time commitment

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:19.914
almost finished out I want to

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.849
make sure that that we're

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.818
honoring those commitments so-

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:27.755
for the three of you you're-

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:29.757
certainly welcome to stay. But

01:35:29.824 --> 01:35:34.128
but it won't arrest you if you.

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:40.034
Believe so. Anyway so thank

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.169
you. Janet are right right so

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.004
centered on thank you have

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:46.140
reached our agents here but all

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:48.008
the struck them not ten fifteen

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:50.111
years. Okay a letter senator

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:51.912
done tries that's a different

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:52.546
story- my only last comment has

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:55.749
are there is model policies-

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.818
through many U. N. agencies or

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.753
working on this. And others-

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.321
that focus on dealing with

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:04.125
implicit. Bias at least now as

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:08.028
initial step. In focusing on

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:10.030
transparency about bias and

01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:11.932
explain ability of the A. I.

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:12.533
platform so that at least the

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.901
public at large has an

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.836
understanding and awareness. Of

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:17.805
the bias issue- now obviously a

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:19.807
lot of the creators of a I.

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:20.341
platforms or worry about

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:21.809
lecture property rates and all

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:23.777
that kind of stuff because- I

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:26.180
know the senator the chair is

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:27.915
well aware of this. Gap in I.

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:28.415
P. protection for a I.

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.117
platforms is not easy. Because

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:32.186
of how one defines a patentable

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.121
idea. It has particularly

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:38.125
difficult application in a I'd

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:42.196
and. See a lot of businesses

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:43.864
vendors exciter keeping their

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:45.766
cards close because they know

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:46.367
in many respects the can't get

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:47.902
I. P. protection- but there's

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:48.469
focus now transparency and

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:50.137
explain ability with respect

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:52.006
the- platforms as a way of.

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:54.008
Least highlighting the bias so

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:56.043
folks are aware and encouraging

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.112
more work on the policy side

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:01.749
tech side. And otherwise- and

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:02.249
I'll just end with the

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:03.751
following challenge I always

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:05.953
the C. from our law enforcement

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.855
community national state local.

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:08.389
They they face a very big

01:37:08.455 --> 01:37:14.028
problem because they the and

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:14.628
they realize that this is not

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:18.098
not not new. In dealing with a

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:20.234
I. nouns true in in past times

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.203
the- all they know that some of

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.837
the biggest spenders in

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:24.471
developing a I. platform happen

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:26.040
to be the drug cartels around

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:27.875
the world- who aren't very

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:28.375
interested in someone's

01:37:28.442 --> 01:37:29.843
constitutional rights or

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.279
privacy or etcetera. Or biased

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:36.050
in their application. And how

01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:36.483
does law enforcement

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:39.887
effectively deal with something

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.922
as severe and serious as drug

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:42.523
cartels on a global basis who

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.325
are spending billions on a I.

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:47.895
development for their purposes.

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.930
And still respond from an

01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:51.865
effective law enforcement

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.767
perspective- but still having

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:56.036
having to which everybody

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:56.470
agrees including law

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.105
enforcement. Under all the

01:37:58.172 --> 01:37:59.873
constitutional privacy perspex-

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.209
protections that exist in this

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:04.144
country- and it makes for a

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:07.881
very very difficult tension-

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.917
and when you're dealing with a

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:11.885
criminal entities out there.

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:12.486
They have lots of money to

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.154
spend on a I don't care about

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.889
bias don't care about privacy

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:16.557
don't care about constitutional

01:38:16.624 --> 01:38:18.125
protections. And how do we

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.094
respond effectively in today's

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.897
society there's a way to do it-

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.498
but it's a difficult- pathway

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:28.035
and sadly- of for our policy

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:30.070
makers in the state legislature

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.939
and the governor's office. You

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:32.539
guys have to make these hard

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:35.876
decisions but I. N. was simply

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.477
biased in a I. including law

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:38.212
enforcement and judiciary. It

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:40.114
it's introduced at multiple

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.016
levels in every single

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:43.984
application it doesn't mean

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:45.886
that anybody is trying to do

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:46.520
something inappropriate. It's

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.188
just inherent into it because

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:51.892
it's us humans to build them-

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.894
and how do we as a society deal

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:54.528
with those by that was a very

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:56.130
difficult challenge as the tech

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:57.965
world tried figured out. But

01:38:58.032 --> 01:39:01.902
you have to try to figure it

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:02.503
out from a policy perspective

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:03.103
all that all in their centers

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:09.877
thank you. Thank you senator-

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.979
and appreciate the tutorial

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:12.613
and- recognize identifying what

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.947
will the reasons we wanted to

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:14.415
deal with. Artificial

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.983
intelligence and how it relates

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:16.450
the judiciary and law

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:17.051
enforcement community and the

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:20.087
issue of bias is because- this

01:39:20.154 --> 01:39:20.587
is an area can be most

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:23.957
pernicious- if for example you

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:26.060
happen to get additional

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:26.727
advertising because somebody is

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:30.130
used in. A I. algorithm to

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:30.764
identify you as someone who is

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:33.967
a potential purchaser of

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:36.003
running shoes but the big deal.

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:40.007
If your liberty is affected

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:44.044
because of a certain bias.

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:44.645
Whether it's in the judicial-

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.447
brown or law enforcement that

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:48.449
that is a big deals and so- I

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.384
know you- as both professor as

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:53.987
well as a foreign policy maker.

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:54.588
Are concerned about a note I

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:56.357
don't know if you've got any of

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.392
your students here today my

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:00.427
desire if I. Understand your so

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:01.995
Cassie okay well thank you very

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:04.098
much for being here but but I

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:04.732
also understand you're gonna be

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.300
working with the orange case

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:10.003
peer court- judge not kommer a

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:12.106
to deal with some of these

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.141
issues and- I'm hoping you'll

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:18.011
keep us abreast. Of how we can

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:18.679
as policy makers make sure that

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:22.015
that. The tools that we permit

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:24.184
our our tools that are both

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:28.122
effective but all so not- let's

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:30.090
not biased in ways that. Are

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:32.159
inappropriate so I want to

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:36.163
thank you for that- thank you

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:40.033
Senate check your questions.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:40.701
Maybe just some comments I want

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:42.302
to thank you so much for your

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:42.936
comprehensive in very thorough

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:44.271
presentation I know all the

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:44.905
getting your contact info and-

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.407
talking offline but just. Just

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:48.275
a brief comment about the self

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:48.909
driving cars because- when I

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.210
was in the same way I

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:52.212
introduced a- legislation self.

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:54.281
Driving cars but why would they

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:58.252
need explicit data in order to

01:40:58.318 --> 01:41:00.154
prevent you know of an

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.256
accident. Because of a person

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:02.923
is crossing the street why when

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:06.160
they use an algorithm just to

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:06.727
figure out the mass. Rather

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:10.397
than like. No gender and skin

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:12.032
color I mean that that's just a

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:12.633
little bizarre to me I would.

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.201
When you're thinking about like

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.036
people crossing the street I

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:16.637
would. I would consider like

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:20.007
the mass of even a dog right.

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:22.242
And not so much like. Like the

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:24.244
gender and race of a person

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:26.246
crossing the street so I'm

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:26.713
gonna. Use about that

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.382
particular company in the

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:30.451
algorithm but- again thank you

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.553
so much for your presentation I

01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:34.121
really appreciate your

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:36.123
expertise thank you senator

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:38.192
it's- interesting on this self

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:40.327
driving cars is. They their

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.296
approach was to identify a mass

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:42.763
mass that look like a

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.465
pedestrian for example. Never

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:46.433
intending- to introduce any

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.535
sort of data or any other

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.604
aspect that might indicate that

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.406
there is. Some relevant

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.174
difference between somebody

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.443
who's male versus female or-

01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.113
inverse after American Exeter

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:02.182
a- but very subtle it got

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:04.284
introduced in the A. I.

01:42:04.351 --> 01:42:04.918
platform picked it up. And that

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:12.125
came from. That's interesting.

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:12.726
All right it in a moment we're

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.194
going to have public Connie I'm

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:14.795
gonna ask those who wish to

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.396
comment to come to the

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:16.964
microphone identify yourself

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:18.232
and if you would Dodd. Where

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:20.133
you reside- the purpose today's

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:20.667
hearing is to focus on

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.269
artificial intelligence and how

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.338
it relates to law enforcement

01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:26.273
so I would ask in terms of.

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.242
Providing us valuable input

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:32.145
that we focus on that aspect-

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:34.581
and- I'm going to right now I'm

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.450
gonna live it folks to three

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:40.254
minutes each. So if you are if

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.523
you wish public comment if you

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:44.558
would approach the Mike from we

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:48.228
have not had folks fought hard

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:50.464
so- if you come forward and-

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.399
for yourself and where you live

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:56.336
a great. Any public comment any

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:56.937
with any persons wish to make.

01:42:57.004 --> 01:43:02.576
Lookup. Thank you so if you if

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:04.545
you wish you could come forward

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:08.215
there's not a long line so

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:08.815
you'd come forward and common.

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:14.421
Right right. Hi good afternoon

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:15.022
my name is Jennifer Ross and I

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:16.456
work with the ACLU of southern

01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:16.990
California here in Orange

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.425
County I'm a resident of

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:19.026
Huntington beach and I work in

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:22.429
orange. You know as thank you

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:24.231
for holding this hearing today

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:26.266
as you well know the public

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.235
deserves to feel safe. In their

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:28.835
own neighborhoods and that's

01:43:28.902 --> 01:43:30.404
why public safety in this

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:32.472
digital era. Must include

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.374
extensive transparency

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.476
community oversight and

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.312
accountability. For a I.

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:40.480
technologies that allow police

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:44.418
to track and detain civilians

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:44.985
as we go about our de daily

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:48.655
lives. You know the committee

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:49.222
spoke today on the need for

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:50.490
public outreach when law

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:50.958
enforcement employees

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:52.326
surveillance technology. And

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:54.661
often times particularly in

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:58.465
this county we find our police

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:58.999
departments and sheriff's

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.500
departments purchasing a

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.469
technology without the public

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.571
without public knowledge or

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:08.508
input- and- we really believe

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:09.142
that the public has a right to

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:12.245
know when local law enforcement

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:12.879
and is considering the purchase

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:16.450
of a I. technology. The secret

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:20.320
use of a technology for as we

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:20.921
know and as was spoken spoken

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:21.321
on today of fuels

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:22.489
discriminatory policing and

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.324
provides recipe for abuse. Add

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:26.426
technology can easily become a

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:26.927
powerful tool for police

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:32.499
misconduct. These technologies

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:33.100
as we know can have the power

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:34.635
to invade our private lives and

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:38.338
create databases vulnerable to

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:38.872
exploitation by local and

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.507
federal government. Of for this

01:44:40.574 --> 01:44:42.509
reason we believe that

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:44.444
community members must have

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.313
extensive opportunity to

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.248
provide input before any.

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.250
Artificial intelligence

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:52.252
technology is purchased by our

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:54.254
local law enforcement agencies-

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.356
and as a legislature we hope

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:58.525
that. The you know are these

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:00.260
committees and the legislature

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.329
as a whole- does all that is in

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:02.829
their power to prevent

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.631
technology from being purchased

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:08.368
without extensive public input

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:09.002
and knowledge. I thank you very

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:14.408
much for your time. Well anyone

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:18.445
else wish to comment. But Sir

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:20.580
go ahead my name is David

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:22.416
radius and I live in Anaheim

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:22.983
for Leslie seven years and I

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:26.253
was invited by a friend of mine

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:28.422
and I came here to learn you

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:30.724
know and so. There's a lot of-

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.626
concern as chairman- mention

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:36.530
regarding bias and privacy and

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:42.569
me being a man of. Color well I

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:43.203
have some concerns on how that

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:46.440
works you mentioned that. There

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.341
was a el Salvadorian who

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:48.909
photographed then if I was

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:52.446
somebody does a smuggler and

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:56.416
that help you catch that person.

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:58.852
How accurate is this you know

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:02.556
so if my face. Had a picture

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:04.491
similar somebody a cartel. You

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:12.466
know. Misidentification. How

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:14.401
accurate is the your morning at.

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:16.403
So can you help me out on this.

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:18.605
Do I have to fear as a person

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:20.373
you know with this the negative

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.375
really mission positive. Things

01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:22.909
that it can do but is very

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:23.543
negative examples that you guys

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:30.417
experience. So Nancy certain.

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.017
The no I appreciate appreciate

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:34.588
your comment. The that if you

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:35.222
direct your comments to us as

01:46:35.288 --> 01:46:36.757
policy makers what will take

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:37.290
them aboard that and after

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:42.395
everyone comments on- provide

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:42.963
some response but- thank you

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:52.439
thank you. Right others yes Sir.

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:53.073
Hey good morning my name's Erik

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:56.610
I'm with the AC you southern

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:57.210
California and I'm in Anaheim

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:58.378
resident have been all my life-

01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:00.447
and I think just a couple of

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:00.914
comments I think one-

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:02.749
predictive policing the sort of

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.484
come up a lot and I think it's

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:04.985
important to note that

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:08.455
predictive policing predicts D.

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:12.626
E. R. activity of police and

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:14.394
that region right these trends

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:16.596
the area as on the people are

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:18.398
all based on who polices

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:20.634
enforcing on not you know what

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.636
I mean and so did that the

01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:24.404
concerned about the target

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.406
retargeting of out of these

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.408
communities I think it's- very

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.677
important and has to be sort

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:31.278
of. Dealt with that with the

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:34.548
doubt see that it is making

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.716
secondly we're already seen to

01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:38.752
the license plate reader point

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.554
hi Julie solutions a private

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.556
corporation is house in a lot

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.156
of this data for a lot of law

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:44.491
enforcement agencies right they

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:45.091
were sharing that information

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.793
with science writing so the

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.461
unintended consequences of

01:47:48.528 --> 01:47:50.564
bringing in the private sector-

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.532
to sell this data and to

01:47:52.599 --> 01:47:54.634
collect this data because law

01:47:54.701 --> 01:47:55.202
enforcement is unable to I

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.636
think has we've already seen

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.805
that issue right and how that

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.574
plays out. Right there is no

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.642
regulations on the way that

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.511
these corporations have access

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:12.519
to it the. Web of data sharing

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:13.119
whereas the public's concern

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.988
has always been to limit it and

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:18.825
we've seen even ice on trial I.

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:19.392
switches and trolley and the

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:22.529
ACLU case the couple last month

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:23.129
I want to say two months ago

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:24.865
maybe- and that the ruling of

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.800
that case- specific ice the

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:30.503
trainers and databases. Which

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:31.137
speaks to the fact that Rabin

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:32.873
was that the status C. these

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.574
databases are ill equipped and

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:36.877
are unable to establish a just

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:38.912
cause or probable cause even

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:40.947
I'm in these cases where are

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.849
the specific database issue was

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:44.885
that US citizens who at some

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.720
point were entered into this

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:48.722
database- as and documented

01:48:48.788 --> 01:48:50.523
immigrants in the past Websense

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:52.525
adjusted status has some sort

01:48:52.592 --> 01:48:53.159
of relief were being detained

01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:55.028
and does what it does for the

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.796
plaintiffs right these are

01:48:56.863 --> 01:48:58.531
folks so there's already been

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.667
sort of- really really

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:01.301
widespread issues with the way

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:06.573
that the status been collected.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.207
In the way that it's being used

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:10.610
right and so just want to. As a

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.579
cautionary sort of examples of

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:13.213
the way that data has been used

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.881
and it's- I totally agree with

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:16.950
with- stone bridge point about.

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:17.550
Right these are concerns of

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:18.885
privacy right and so I think

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:20.887
they do need to be dealt with

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:21.521
very seriously thank you. Thank

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:26.693
your- others. Anyone else wish

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.597
to comment all right. If

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:31.197
there's anyone else- indicia

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.999
this gentleman- if you'd line

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:35.068
up just so I can get a sense of

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.903
how many folks want to comment

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:38.571
that would be great. Go ahead.

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:41.007
I have a morning my name is

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:42.709
tomorrow but my love you sent

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:44.544
the I'm currently a resident.

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.680
Of Santana I'm also a source

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:47.180
just as fellow Canadians

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.882
resources fellowship- and pan

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:52.686
PVC serve two terms on the C.

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:53.153
Berkeley's police you

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:54.621
commission. So I have

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:55.255
previously worked on policies

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:56.756
relating to a I. and

01:49:56.823 --> 01:49:58.725
surveillance technology. I

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.627
think first and foremost what

01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:02.529
other folks have emphasized I

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:03.163
think it's really important for

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:04.898
the committee to be aware of

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:06.933
income is events technologies.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.635
That are gonna be inputted into

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:09.235
the police department I would

01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:11.004
like one recommendation is you

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:12.806
know being allowed to host a

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:14.874
community forum. Where the

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:15.475
communities can allow to have

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.010
input- I went to and what type

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:18.845
of technologies that local

01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:20.981
enforcements want to your life

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:23.083
in order to enforce and- M.

01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:26.686
police these communities- I

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:27.220
think also employed in a

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.888
conversation and important

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.790
message. Is I feel like all of

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:32.659
us should feel safe especially

01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:33.226
in our own neighborhoods. I

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.095
think that's why public safety

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.830
and that the Joel era must

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:38.832
include transparency oversight

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:40.700
and accountability for

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.769
technology that allow police to

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:44.804
track and detain us. As we go

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.639
about our daily lives make

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:47.207
false arrest interrogate us

01:50:47.273 --> 01:50:48.975
regarding our protective for

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:51.044
some M. activities. And portray

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.812
activists groups are for let's

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:53.380
let's take the deportation

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:58.651
machine- and as other folks

01:50:58.718 --> 01:51:06.893
have been seen in- transparency

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.460
and accountability. Is there

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:10.997
any. I think it's very

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.699
important for me to have it.

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.333
Community folks and surrounding

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:13.933
cities in Orange County thank

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.936
you. Thank you. Hello my name

01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:18.838
is Jordan Roger I am currently

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:19.439
reside in Irvine and I am a

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.007
member of senator done on a I.

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:21.641
frontier course at UCLA school

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:23.043
of law- one thing that I just

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:24.911
really wanted to urge both of

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:26.846
you to consider and all the

01:51:26.913 --> 01:51:28.715
senators and representatives of

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:30.750
the state of California- kind

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:31.217
of goes to one of the

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:34.654
testimonies today about the

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:36.790
protections of facial

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.658
recognition and thumbprint

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:42.662
recognition on phones- so judge

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:43.229
west more of the Northern

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:46.900
District. Of California

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:47.534
actually has written an opinion

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.837
and five that those should be

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:51.371
protected under the Fifth

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.705
Amendment and because it is a

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.974
passcode and- the Supreme Court

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.810
has ruled previously. Thought

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.878
passcode are considered they

01:51:58.945 --> 01:52:00.780
can't be used against you went

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:02.816
in a police interrogation or-

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:04.684
for the like past thought I'm

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:06.853
just because- that is self

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.888
incriminating- and so I think

01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:10.990
that going forward we need to

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.826
make sure that we are being

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:13.326
protected by her Fifth

01:52:13.393 --> 01:52:14.928
Amendment. And she said that

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:18.665
face ID and the fingerprinting.

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.900
Is could be self incriminating

01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:22.836
and so. She blocked that for

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:28.808
being used- but just the future

01:52:28.875 --> 01:52:29.442
policy makers need to make sure

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:32.712
that we are being affected.

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:33.246
Amendment thank you miss

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:37.016

many miss Kathy doubt I am also

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:42.755
a student with senator done at

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.858
U. C. I. law I'm our concern as

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:46.860
process prospect of attorneys

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:47.494

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.930
of a I. Is at present a I. has

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:51.564
a problem with implicit bias as

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.099
we have touched upon in

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:56.803
testimony today on the topic of

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:57.370
transparency in I hope the

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:59.005
Orange County Superior Court-

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:01.207
shares with the community how

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:02.909
they propose to reduce bias

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:05.111
Dodd being fed into the court

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:08.848
used a I. systems- and also how

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:10.884
a I will be used to victory

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:12.785
process more effective. Among

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.787
the other processes being

01:53:14.854 --> 01:53:15.355
created this touches upon I

01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:18.992
believe the need for perhaps

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:20.927
are more education to the

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:22.996
public and there are members of

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:24.797
the public are desperately

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:26.799
compacted- and who also don't

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:29.068
have access to fuller fully

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:31.070
understanding the rights to

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:34.807
publications that bring. I'm

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:39.012
into this world so you just

01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:39.579
would hope the consent that

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:42.982
thank you. Thank you what with

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:47.120
you all. So for example just

01:53:47.187 --> 01:53:48.922
taking the last comment is that

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:50.924
I could certainly see if you're

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.892
trying to create a jury pool

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:55.028
that you you want to make sure

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:56.863
that you have jurors who can

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:59.132
participate two or three week

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:01.067
trial that would tend to

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.136
indicate they want retirees

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:06.806
they'll query whether by just

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:07.373
by focusing on retirees you

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.175
biasing the jury pool in an

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:10.910
appropriate way I don't know

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:13.146
the answer that but I do know

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:16.816
that that that creates.

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.851
Interesting dilemma court.

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:19.419
Queen those who can put ten

01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:21.221
server. North thirty year old

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:23.122
who's hourly employee may not

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:24.958
may not be able to serve so or

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:26.826
you want to respond Jackson J.

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:29.062
sure say that the public to

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:29.596
federal beer the presiding

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:35.068
judge to because. Go ahead Klay

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:35.602
involved in any type of

01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:37.170
considerations that we make

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.905
with respect for jury pull. Up

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.940
we already received a letter

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:41.541
from Richard purpose you know

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:43.076
just about a week ago-

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:46.813
enquiring whether the court is

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:48.915
going to make sure that-

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.950
convicted felons who are now. A

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:53.052
part of our jury pool as long

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:56.923
as they're not probation are.

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:58.958
Included in- the our summons

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:03.096
and- but we- definitely will

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:07.300
use up with the district

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:09.002
attorney as well as- and- in

01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:11.304
any topic Senate races we- we

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:11.871
make in terms of making sure

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:13.339
that the- all is representative

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:15.375
of the population as we are

01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:17.243
required to do but- thank you I

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:19.445
and I think that's it that's

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:21.314
that is illustrative of a

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.116
difficult situation I. Retired

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:23.683
to may have more time versus

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:27.120
thirty. Least my view of a bias

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:29.255
so heavily in favor of retirees

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:31.324
but we say it's often we want

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:33.059
pre qualified jurors- because

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.395
it makes trees like a process

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:37.263
much more. Hey can expedited

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:39.332
but often times the public

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:41.234
federal defense will object to

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:43.136
that which is the right sure

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:45.238
and we have to- exceed two well

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:47.340
good luck with that judge I

01:55:47.407 --> 01:55:49.142
know you'll come up with the

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.144
system that do it is fair about

01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:53.146
honoring it and we use that

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:57.350
term- so the any. You could fit

01:55:57.417 --> 01:56:01.087
I not read the case. Fifth

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:01.721
Amendment violation. Which is

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:02.955
interesting burst forth ma'am

01:56:03.022 --> 01:56:03.523
but many of it so appreciate

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.990
you bring that to our

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:05.258
attention- the purchase of

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:08.961
systems. A I. systems I hadn't

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:09.529
thought about that but that

01:56:09.595 --> 01:56:12.932
that's another. Important point

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:14.934
to is this the how we're going

01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:15.435
to provide that kind of

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:18.938
transparency but still- not

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:20.940
reveal certain investigative

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:21.541
techniques that may alert bad

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:25.111
guys and gals. As to where

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.946
we're we're going that's that's

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:29.015
another tension that that has

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.950
been illustrated here today-

01:56:31.017 --> 01:56:32.952
and then sailed the sale that's

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:33.586
why I was asking the question

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:35.154
about. You know the collection

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:37.390
of data so whether or you know

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:41.027
somebody collects data. And

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:43.229
then can sell it that is very

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:46.966
very concerning to me and I

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:48.968
think probably the other.

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:51.037
Legislators as well so- I'm

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:52.972
gonna turn the person tanker

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:55.141
for her concluding comments

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:58.978
and- an- agency in just a

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:04.984
second but this is been more.

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:07.153
Valuable for me thanks for step.

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:11.257
Again the arms wrapped on this

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:11.858
is incredibly important issue

01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:12.959
that were- as we will

01:57:13.025 --> 01:57:13.526
straighten the last hearing

01:57:13.593 --> 01:57:15.395
that we had we're way behind as

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:17.363
a state in in in addressing it

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.132
so let me let me turn it over

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.067
to send a check thank you and

01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:23.136
again I want to think Mr men

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:25.371
for convening. It is. Important

01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:27.407
to make an I am definitely

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:28.074
going to be paying attention to

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:29.142
the transparency aspects of

01:57:29.208 --> 01:57:31.277
the- the selling of data- and I

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.346
already have some ideas in

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:35.281
terms of. What we can do to

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:37.283
ensure transparency especially

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:39.419
of how they are collecting the

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:43.122
data. And being sold and- you

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:45.057
know what platforms are being

01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:45.658
used to collect data I think

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:49.429
that- you know in and I'm just

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:51.264
thinking out loud. Some people

01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:51.864
like only guy slings anything.

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:55.568
But in terms of how the data is

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:57.069
gathered who's selling it and-

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:59.172
I think we need to have some

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:01.274
type of the trail so that we

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.075
can. I'm sure that it is being-

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:05.311
gathered in nothing up way- but

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:09.081
it is a very complex issue and-

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:09.715
I'm hoping that Mister chair

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:11.517
will be convening a more of

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:13.519
these hearings because I think

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:15.388
it's important to gather public

01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:15.988
input as well so. Thank you so

01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:17.523
much. M. with that we're going

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:21.227
to conduct. Thank you so much

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:21.794
specially to members of the

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.129
panel Preciado thank you Sir.

01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:43.115
One thank reporter there yeah
