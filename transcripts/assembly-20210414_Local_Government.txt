CV OUR EIGHT DURING THE NOVEMBER THIRD TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION MEASURE G. WHICH APPEAR ON THE BALLOT SOUGHT TO REMOVE FROM THE CITY CHARTER ALL REFERENCES TO THE ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. HOWEVER MEASURE G. ONLY APPEAR ON THE BALLOT SO VOTERS RESIDING IN THE ITY OF ALHAMBRA AND NOT ON THE BALLOT SO VOTERS IN ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL ALSO RECITE OUTSIDE OF CITY OF THE CITY BOUNDARIES. NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW CHARTER AMENDMENT FOR CITY MUST BE SUBMITTED TO VOTERS AT AN ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION. SO CONSEQUENTLY THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE PROHIBITED FROM CONDUCTING A SPECIAL ELECTION TO AMEND THE CHARTER PRIOR TO THE NEXT STATEWIDE ELECTION ON NOVEMBER THE EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THEREFORE WE NEED TO CREATE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE TO PERMIT THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA. AND THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO CONDUCT A SPECIAL ELECTION BEFORE THE NEXT STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION. TO ACHIEVE THIS I RECENTLY SUBMITTED AN AMENDMENT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO ADDED URGENCY COST TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT DISTRICT BILL. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IDOL. THANK YOU.

EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY SIX SUPPORT THE EFFORT AND INTENT OF THE ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ESTABLISH DISTRICT BASED ELECTION BOARD OF TRUSTEES A LINE TO THE FAIR AND DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AB FIFTEEN FORTY SIX ALSO ADDRESSES THE UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE OUTDATED REFERENCES IN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA CHARTER RELATED TO ELECTION FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CONFLICT WITH THE DISTRICT EFFORTS TO ADOPT THE TRUSTEE AREA ELECTION MODEL. TO ADDRESS ISSUE- AS THE AUTHORS STATED THE CITY PLATE THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO REMOVE THE OUTDATED LANGUAGE AND REFERENCES TO THE DISTRICT AND THE CHARTER. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO AN ERROR IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CITY'S ELECTION REVOLUTION THAT MEASURE ONLY APPEARED ON BALLOTS FOR VOTERS WITHIN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA. AND DID NOT APPEAR ON BALLOTS FOR VOTERS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT RESIDE OUTSIDE THE CITY'S BOUNDARIES. THEREFORE THE MEASURE HAD TO BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE ELECTION. WAITING UNTIL THE TWENTY TWENTY TO STATE GENERAL ELECTION WOULD DELAY THE DISTRICT EFFORT TO ESTABLISH TRUST THE AREAS THAT ALIGN THEIR ELECTIONS. WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT PRIOR TO THE NEXT ELECTION OF THE GOVERNING BOARD MEMBERS- EIGHTY FOUR FIFTEEN FORTY SIX. CREATE A SPECIAL EXEMPTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO PLACE THE MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. AT ANY ELECTION IDENTIFIED IN THE ELECTION CODE.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTION WHAT THE DECOUPLE THE DISTRICT FROM THE CITY CHARTER TO ALLOW THE DOCTOR TO CONTINUE WITH ITS TRANSITION FROM AT LARGE TO BUY TURKEY AREA ELECTIONS. IN TIME FOR THE NEXT BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL ACTION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

INSURED THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES AND DUTIES OF THE CITY OF CONCORD. THIS WHOLE BILL COMES DOWN TO ONE SIMPLE QUESTION.

OKAY AND I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT THE CHEROKEE ARE CURRY. RECOMMENDS A SUPPORT. THE CALL FOR THE QUESTION. LACKEY HI LACKEY I BLOOM BLOOM I BOERNER HORVATH. ALTHOUGH. RIVERS BERMAN HI READERS LAUDABLE FOR FAR BEHIND. OKAY ZERO. ROGER THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. OKAY LET'S GO BACK TO. I AM TOO I UNDERSTAND THAT OF MYSTERY US ARE YOU PRESENTING. OKAY IF YOU WOULD DO SO. RIGHT. WELL COLLEAGUES IN SURVIVES CHAIR COULD SEE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN I THINK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION ENGAGEMENT ON ON THIS BILL AND I'VE ACCEPTED- OR DO ACCEPT ALL THE PROPOSED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS- AND SO AS WE ALL KNOW UNFORTUNATELY I. DID TOO WELL IS THAT- THE MANY FACTORS THAT- HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND- THEY CONTINUE TO LOOK. AT QUé EXCUSE ME CONTRIBUTED TO CALIFORNIA HOUSING CRISIS- THE YOU KNOW THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOMES TO GROWING HIGH DEMAND OF HOUSING- IT HAS LED TO EXCESSIVE RENT BURDENS HOUSING INSTABILITY AND INCREASING HOMELESSNESS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO THE REALITY IN MOST CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS WE HAVE LOCAL PLANNING. AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS THAT DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY RESTRICT HOUSING. PRODUCTION AND DO SO IN MANY WAYS WE SEE REQUIRING PARKING SPACE MINIMUMS IMPOSING- SOME BUILDING HEIGHT LIMITS HAVE BEEN LINKED THE SOME PERMITTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. VIEW- SOME PROCESSES. AND HAVING VERY RIGID ZONING AND DENSITY AND YOU SPACE PLANNING SYSTEMS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE L. A. O. LOCAL ANTI GROWTH POLICIES AND LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS OUR STATE. HAVE EXPLICITLY AIMED TO LIMIT HOUSING GROWTH HISTORICALLY. AND SO AS A STATE OFFICIALS AND THIS LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO MORE IN ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS THE COMMITTEE BILL ANALYSIS NOTED. VERY ACCURATELY THAT WHILE CERTAIN LOCAL VOTER APPROVED MEASURES MAY NOT HAVE- CONFLICTED WITH STATE HOUSING LAW AT THE TIME OF THEIR ADOPTION. I STATE HOUSING LAW EVOLVES AND HAS EVOLVED AND WILL CONTINUE ABLE. EVOLVE THESE INITIATIVES MAY CREATE A CONFLICT THAT RENDERS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LOCAL- THE GOVERNING BODY TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL MEASURES AND STATE HOUSING LAW. AND SO CLEARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- CITY COUNCIL'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THERE IN A VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION HAVING TO BALANCE LOCAL PLANNING AND REGULATORY HOUSING MEASURES. AND SYSTEMS AND WORKING TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING STATE HOUSING LAW. AND SO ENFORCEMENT POWERS GRANTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF H. C. D. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING LAWS. AND DETERMINE THAT LOCAL HOUSING ELEMENTS ARE IN COMPLIANCE FOR MEETING STATE HOUSING GOALS AND TARGETS NOW SUBSEQUENT ISSUES. OF NONCOMPLIANCE BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH REGARDS TO STATE HOUSING LAWS AND HOUSING ELEMENTS. ARE TO BE REFERRED TO THE SATE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD RESULT IN FEES PENALTIES AND OTHER CONSEQUENCES. AND SO THIS LEGISLATION. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THREE TWO TWO. IT'S A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OPTIONAL PROCESS AS A TOOL. FOR ANY CITY OR COUNTY TO SEEK JUDICIAL VALIDATION THAT A LOCAL HOUSING OR GROWTH MEASURE IS IN CONFLICT WITH STATE HOUSING LAW. SO THIS OPTION WOULD RESULT IN AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW OR A JUDICIAL RULING ON THIS ISSUE OR THIS QUESTION OF STATE AND LOCAL PREEMPTION RELATED HOUSING LAWS. IT WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH IT WOULD YOU KNOW WITH WITH WITH THIS OPTION IT WITH WITH LEGAL CERTAINTY. ABOUT THEIR HOUSING OBLIGATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IT'S A WITH ME TO TESTIFY BY PHONE IS SERRA. KARLINSKY SENIOR POLICY ADVISER FOR THE CENSUS GO BAY AREA PLANNING AND URBAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS BURKE. AND CHRISTOPHER ELMENDORF A LAW PROFESSOR AT UC DAVIS WITH EXPERTISE IN LAND USE THANK YOU MISTER MISTER BASHER. THANK YOUR MODERATOR COULD WE OF PLEASE LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE KARLINSKY IF SHE'S ON THE LINE. YES HELLO- CAN YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY WE CAN'T THANK YOU. OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS ERIC KARLINSKY AND I AM SENIOR ADVISOR IT'S BURKE A PUBLIC POLICY THINK TANK FOCUSED ON CREATING A SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE AND PROSPEROUS REGION AND STATE. BRAD TO SPONSOR AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO THE HOUSING ELEMENT LOCAL OPTIONS ACT. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED. I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED PIEDMONT. WHICH IS AN INCORPORATED CITY WITHIN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. HE'S NOT AS WEALTHY AND 70% WHITE. IT WAS ONCE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF MILLIONAIRES. THE AVERAGE HOME PRICES ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD MANY OF THAT COULD NOT JUST STAND BY AND ALLOW BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE FORMED A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PIEDMONT RACIAL EQUITY CAMPAIGNER PRAC. CORRECT WORK IS FOCUSED ON EDUCATION POLICING DIVERSIFYING CITY LEADERSHIP AND HOUSING. SHE AND HER HUSBAND WORKS WE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THE CITY PIEDMONT HAS WITHIN ITS CITY CHARTER REQUIREMENT DATING BACK NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS THAT ANY DINING CHANGES NEED TO BE APPROVED BY VOTERS. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT PIEDMONT IS LIKELY TO BE ALLOCATED ALMOST SIX HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING TO PLAN FOR AS PART OF ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION INCLUDING A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX UNITS ARE VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING. THERE'S NO WAY FOR PIEDMONT TO ACCOMMODATE THREE ALLOCATION. WITH ITS CURRENT CHARTER RESTRICTIONS. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE THAT SHARE THE CHALLENGE AS SO CALLED ENTRENCH CONSTRAINS. HE'S GONNA TRANSFER ENCOUNTERED STATE HOUSING LARA AND SHRINE RACIAL SEGREGATION. THE USER NOT BY ACCIDENT BUT BY DESIGN. INTRANSITIVE STRAIGHT CODIFIED EXCLUSIONARY ZONING FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN SMALLER HOMES ARE RENDERED ILLEGAL. EXCLUSIONARY ZONING RUNS COUNTER TO THE FAIR HOUSING GOAL OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. MANY CITIES OF THOSE WHICH STATED RELYING ON TO ACCOMMODATE MORE HOUSING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY IN ORDER TO FURTHER IF THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS. BUT THE CITY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER FAIR HOUSING WITHOUT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL. WE SEE THIS MEASURE AS RESTORE LOCAL CONTROL AT THE COMMONLY WORK IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. AND THAT RESTORED LAND USE DECISIONS TO LOCALLY ELECTED BODIES WHO NEED TO USE THEIR GOOD JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION ABOUT BALANCING THE DESIRES OF SOME NEIGHBORS WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE LAW. WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THIS TO IT'S COMPLETELY OPTIONAL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WE THINK THAT THIS MEASURE CREATES MORE LOCAL CONTROL IN THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOLS SO THAT CITIES DON'T FIND THEMSELVES STUCK BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. IF THEY TRY TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION MY COMMENTS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND MOVE IT FORWARD. THANK YOU MS KARLINSKY NOW- CHRISTOPHER. ELMENDORF IF YOU'RE ONLINE. I AM YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU BYE SURE LACKEY MEMBERS I'M CHRIS ON THE DOOR I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UC DAVIS AND MY REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON WILL PROVIDE LEGAL CONTEXT WITH THE BILL. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO USERS A WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL MECHANISM TO HELP CITIES AVOID THE TRAIN BACK THERE WILL OTHERWISE RESULT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CLIMATE ADAPTATION NEEDS CRASH INTO VOTER ADOPTED BIRTH CONTROL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS LEGAL BACK IS CALLED VALIDATION. IT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED THE CITY'S COULD PROVIDE ASSURANCES TO MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTORS. AFTER CITY COUNCIL PASSES A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT. AS A BRIEF WINDOW OF TIME IN WHICH ANY INTERESTED PERSON CAN SHOW UP IN COURT TO CONTEST OR TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE RESOLUTION. COURTS ARE REQUIRED TO SCHEDULE VALIDATION ACTION HEAD OF OTHER CIVIL MATTERS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO BUT USE THIS MECHANISM TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF A RESOLUTION BUT ACKNOWLEDGES. THAT A PROVISION OF A CITY CHARTER OR PROVISION ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS HAS BEEN PREEMPTED BY STATE HOUSING LAW. IMPORTANTLY AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO DOES NOT ITSELF PREEMPTS ANY LOCAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT NOW PREEMPTED. NOR DOES IT CHANGE THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR PREEMPTION. IT SIMPLY CREATE THE PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORK THROUGH WHICH CITIES MAINTAIN BEAGLE CERTAINTY AT LOW RISK ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS. WITHOUT THIS FRAMEWORK THREE DAYS THE NORMAL STRESS. THE CITY DESPITE THE HONOR VOTER ADOPTED GROWTH CONTROL EXPENSIVE STATE LAW THE RECORDING HOUSING ELEMENT THE CERTIFIED RESULTING IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION AND IF THE CITY LOSES LOTS OF LOCAL CONTROL OVER MAX. CONVERSELY THE CITY NOTED THAT IT WILL NOT HONOR VOTER ADOPT RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE IT THINK THEY'RE PREEMPTED THE CITY'S LIKELY FACE LAWSUITS FROM LOCAL ANTI DEVELOPMENT GROUPS. THE CITY THEN MOVE IN COURT IT WILL HAVE. TO PAY THE PREVAILING PARTY'S ATTORNEYS THE- UNDER HUNDRED EIGHTY THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. CITIZENDIUM TO USE THE VALIDATE MECHANISM TO GET A SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF A LEGAL QUESTION. AND WITHOUT BEING MADE TO PAY FOR ANYONE ELSE LAWYERS. BEFORE CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THIS BILL HAS BEEN A REAL GROUP THAT WORKS. SPUR ABOUT THE BALL ROLLING I HAD SOME IDEAS AND A HOST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS.

GIVEN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ANDWE HAVE NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES MISS PERHAPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A PERSON IN THIS BILL- MY CITY IS ONE OF THE CITIES THAT HAS A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- AND WHEN I READ THIS BILL- I HAD VERY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT BECAUSE ONE I FEEL- THAT IN THIS COUNTRY. A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL INDICATIONS WE HAVE ABOUT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT THAT WILL OF THE PEOPLE. ON THE OTHER HAND MY CITY HAS STRUGGLED FOR YEARS. ON THE ISSUE OF DOES OUR BALLOT IT IT DOES OUR PROP PROP A CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW HCD SAYS IT DOES. WE SAID IT DOESN'T WE GO BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS NOW. SO THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT WOULD GIVE A QUICKER RESOLUTION. THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS. IS YOUR REQUIRING A LOCAL COUNCIL TO MAKE AN AFFIRMATION THAT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE VIOLATE STATE LAW. MANY SMALLER CITIES ARE NOT TO BE IN THE POSITION TO MAKE THAT AFFIRMATION IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO HIRE VERY EXPENSIVE LAWYERS. INTO IF THEY'RE UP HOLDING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THEN THE FINDING THAT. THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW IS IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR DUTY AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TO UPHOLD THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A BETTER. RESOLUTION OF THIS IS THAT THE COUNCIL CAN PASS A RESOLUTION THAT SAYS IT'S A VIOLATION AND- IT'S IN CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW. OR NOT IN CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW. BECAUSE REALLY CITIES DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE CONFLICT IT'S YOU KNOW IN STATE LAW. SO IT WOULD BE BETTER I MEAN THE BEST SITUATION WOULD BE IS IF. THERE COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE THE CITY SAYS I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. COULD THE COURTS CLARIFIED AND THERE COULD BE AN EXPEDITED CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THEN THAT PUTS THE COUNCIL IN A POSITION WHERE GETS CLARIFIED IN THE COURT. AND THE COUNCIL CAN STILL UPHOLD THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME GET THE CLARIFICATION SO THERE'S NOT I MEAN I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LEGAL FEES MY CITY IS GOING THROUGH. TRYING TO GET THIS CLARIFIED AND STILL THERE'S NO JUDICIAL RULING ON WHETHER OR NOT PROP THEY IS OR IS NOT IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW IN MY CITY. SO ON THE ONE HAND I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE IT'SAN OPTIMIZER. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY RARE CASE THAT A COUNCIL SAY. THE WILL OF MY PEOPLE VIOLATE STATE LAW THAT'S LIKE US. STRANGE THING TO DO AND I'M HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE. A CONSIDER SOME AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE- ALONG THOSE LINES. YES I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW- TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU I'VE FOUND OUT. RELATIVELY RECENTLY THAT I'D BE PRESENTING THIS BILL TODAY AND THAT'S NOT MY BILL- AND SO I. BUT YEAH YOU KNOW I BELIEVE IN THE POLICY AND SOON I'M GOING TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT I HAVE YET TO ENGAGE WITH AS OF TODAY IS NOW JUST- HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MORNING. BUT E. AND BUT I THINK IT YOU KNOW I THINK YOU BRING UP IN IT YOU KNOW IMPORTANT- POINTS IT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION- YEAH I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT. THIS THIS IS A BILL- CERTAINLY IT REQUIRES NOTHING BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S OFTEN IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S AN OPTION I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROCESS. AS IT'S STRUCTURED. AS PROPOSED IN THE BILL AS YOU KNOW- IF YOU TRIGGER- YOU KNOW WHAT ADOPTION HORIZON- OF- A RESOLUTION AS AS AS AS STIPULATED REQUIRING A PUBLIC HEARING A- THE YELP. A PUBLIC HEARING TO HAVE DISCUSSION TO HAVE THAT PUBLIC. INPUT IS A CRITICAL STEP YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FOR YOU KNOW AT I MYSELF AM SPENT EIGHT YEARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE KINDS OF VISOR- YOU KNOW ITS- YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT BUT- YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW I'VE- YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SPONSORS- TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS- AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THANK YOU SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING TODAY BUT I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND I CAN SUPPORT ON THE FOR THE FUTURE. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY OTHE. OR FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SAYING NINE ONE YOU'RE WELCOME TO CLOSE. I TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE STRUCTURE THANK YOU TO HAVE A MOTION SECOND. YOUR OKAY RECALL FOR THE QUESTION A- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMANDA HOUSING AND COMMUNITY HIGH COULD ADD REAL QUICKLY THE CHAIR AGUIAR-CURRY- RECOMMENDS A SUPPORT. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A MAN TO HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLACKIE. NO LACKEY NOW BLOOM. HELLO I BOERNER HORVATH NOW BOERNER HORVATH NO RAMOS. RAMOS I THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS NUMBER RIVERSIDE VOEPEL WILL TELL NOW YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A THREE THREE. OKAY SOLD OUT FOR A- PUT IT ON CALL FOR A LATER AFFIRMATION NEEDS BUT TO MORE. K. WHICH TO WORK OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTINO. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK- THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THE BILL I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINE OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX REGARDING EASY PARKING AND PARKING SPACES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES I WANT TO TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S VALUES HAS REFLECTED ITS POLICIES. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THERE'S AN AVERAGE OF ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET PROVIDED PER CAR BUT ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET PROVIDED PER PERSON PER HOUSING WE DEDICATE MORE LAND FOR CARS THAN WE DO FOR HUMAN BEINGS IN THE UNITED STATES NOT L. A. COUNTY PARKING MANDATES HAVE LED TO AN ASTONISHING TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES JUST OF PARKING. THAT'S FOUR TIMES AS MUCH LAND AS IN THE ENTIRE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND YET A STUDY FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OF TWENTY ONE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE HUNDRED SPACES RUN USED. ACOSTA BETWEEN TWELVE AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND BURBANK. SHE HAS A PARKING GARAGE IN. A PARKING STRUCTURE THAT EVEN BEFORE COLLUDED WAS MAYBE 15% OF CAPACITY ON EVERY GIVEN DAY AND YET. THE SAME CITY. RIGHT WHAT WITH WHERE THE AREAS RIGHT NEXT TO A METROLINK STATION. REQUIRES A LOT OF PARKING BE BUILT FOR EVERY SINGLE DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT EVER TAKING STOCK OF HOW MUCH PARKING IS AVAILABLE AND HOW IT'S BEING USED. ONLY TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT THE CITY OF BUFFALO NEW YORK. THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REMOVE PARKING RESTRICTIONS FROM THEIR ENTIRE CITY. A NEW REPORT CAME OUT THAT SHOWED. THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS DEVELOPERS WHO NEED A PARKING STILL PROVIDED PARKING BUT A LOT OF DEVELOPERS BUILD SHARED PARKING PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT A LOT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NEW HOUSING UNITS WERE PRODUCED. PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH LESS PARKING THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN. REQUIRED AND YET WITH ENOUGH PARKING TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE RESIDENTS. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT WITH IN AREAS THAT ARE IN HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT DISTRICTS. IT WOULD SAY THAT IT'S UP TO DEVELOPERS TO RIGHT SIZE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THAT CITIES CAN NO LONGER ARBITRARILY- AND UNEVENLY DECLARE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PARKING FOR THOSE. FOR THOSE- NEW DEVELOPMENTS. A CROSS CALIFORNIA IT RANGES FROM A CITIES THAT WILL REQUIRE WATER ONE AND A HALF SPACES PER HOUSING UNIT UP TO TWO AND A HALF SPACES PER HOUSING UNIT REGARDLESS. OF THE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IT IS. OF THIS IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS NOT SERVED AS TO WHAT IS A DONE WHAT IS DONE AND IS IT'S CREATED OF A SITUATION WHERE IT'S HARD TO BUILD HOUSING IN A LOT OF OUR AREAS BECAUSE THE PARKING CAN RANGE FROM THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE UP TO I'VE SEEN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FACE RACE FOR SOME SUBTERRANEAN PARKING WHICH MEANS THAT PROJECTS THAT ARE MAYBE ON THE BUBBLE THAT ARE TRYING TO CREATE HOUSING FOR THE MISSING MIDDLE DON'T COUNCIL AND THE DEVELOPERS JUST WALK AWAY. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO ADD ONE UNIT LET'S SAY- LET'S LEGAL. IN A MULTI FAMILY AREA OFTEN CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF SPACE CONSTRAINTS. EVEN IF THERE IS ALREADY SOME PARKING ON THE WATER ENOUGH FOR THOSE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THE POLICY ALSO ENCOURAGES A CAR CENTRIC APPROACH THAT MAKES WALKABLE BIKEABLE COMMUNITIES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. BECAUSE ALL THAT PARKING SPREADS. DEVELOPMENTS APART TO WHERE YOU CAN'T WALK EASILY FROM ONE TO THE NEXT. THINK ABOUT OLD DOWNTOWNS AND HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO STROLL DOWN MAIN STREET. IMAGINE TODAY ALL OF THOSE SAME LITTLE SHOPS ALL HAVING TO PROVIDE FIBRE TEN SPACES ON THEIR OWN SITES YOU CAN'T BUILD THOSE AREAS. AND YET CITIES ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF CREATING BETTER TRANSIT FOR PEOPLE. AND SHARED PARKING IF THEY NEED TO. MANY DOWNTOWNS HAVE MUNICIPAL STRUCTURES BUT TAKE THE BURDEN OFF OF. THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES SO CITIES HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. BUT THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM. TO CREATE GOOD TRANSIT. IF THEY'RE JUST HAVING EVERYBODY BRING THE CARS AND- WHAT THAT DOES IS IT INCREASES CONGESTION INCREASES BAD HEALTH EFFECTS. IS A TERRIBLE USE OF LAND. AND THIS BILL ONLY AFFECTS AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY CONSIDERED HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR HIGH QUALITY TRANCE IT'S ENOUGH. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO CREATE THE POLITICAL WILL TO CREATE THAT TRANSIT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF YOU KEEP INVITING MORE MORE CARS IN. IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY HEY WE'VE GOT ALL THE PARKING WE'VE GOT ALL THE CARS WE DON'T NEED TO DO ANYMORE. IT'S TIME TO END THAT MADNESS. TO REFLECT OUR VALUES TO PUT THE FOCUS BACK ON HUMAN BEINGS AND INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSING UNITS. AND THIS IS A SENSIBLE MEASURE. THAT IS A LONG TIME IN COMING IN SEVERAL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY MOVED. TO THIS APPROACH AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM ONE OF OUR WITNESSES. AND I WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING ARE JEFF AND YOU ENDED MAYOR OF BERKELEY. AND MEET A KING THE SENIOR PRICE AS A PRESIDENT OF RELATED CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BONTA MODERATOR COOLEY PLEASE SURE FROM. JESSE THE MEREB. AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME GO SOMEWHERE YES. GOOD AFTERNOON AS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF BERKLEY I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FORTINO ONE NINETY THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH TO MAKE HOUSING MOREAFFORDABLE. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BY 15% IN ORDER TO MEET IT'S SB THIRTY TWO CLIMATE GOALS EVEN IN A SCENARIO WITH FULL VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION. STUDIES IN MULTIPLE CITIES INCLUDING BERKELEY SHOW THAT MANDATORY PARKING REQUIREMENTS HAVE LED TO AN OVERSUPPLY PARKING BY ELIMINATING PARKING MINIMUMS CITIES CAN REDUCE ACCESS PARKING AND ENCOURAGE THE RESIDENTS TO TAKE MORE SUSTAINABLE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THAT'S REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND IT BE ICAL MISSIONS. FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES BOLD ACTION AND CHALLENGING LONG HELD ASSUMPTIONS ON HOW WE LIVE AND HOW WE COMMUTE. IN ADDITION REQUIRING ACCESS PARKING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO TRY WITH THE COSTA HOUSING. MANDATORY PARKING REQUIREMENTS WORSE IN CALIFORNIA SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE BY RAISING THE COST OF HOUSING PRODUCTION. ON AVERAGE A GARAGE COSTS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE TO BUILD AND THAT COST IS PASSED ON TO HOUSEHOLDS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY OWN A CAR. LIKE WITH SO MANY ISSUES I AM PROUD THAT BERKELEY IS JOINED OTHER CALIFORNIA CITIES IN LEADING THE WAY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. IN JANUARY OUR CITY COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDE OFF STREET PARKING SPACES. ARE LAW ALSO ESTABLISHED A PARKING MAXIMUM APPOINT FIVE PARKING SPACES FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. AND THIS WAS BASED ON PARKING SURVEYS THAT SHOW THAT MANY PARKING SPOTS IN- OUR COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS OFTEN ARE IN HOUSTON THIS IS CERTAIN THE CASE IN CITIES LIKE BERKELEY. THAT HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST PEDESTRIAN BICYCLIST COMMUTE RATES IN THE COUNTRY. REMOVING OFF STREET PARKING WILL MAKE PROJECTS MORE AFFORDABLE. AND ALLOW MORE UNITS TO BE CREATED. LIKE BERKELEY SLOT. BILL FORTINO ONE GIVES DEVELOPERS TOOLS TO RIGHT SIDE PARKING REQUIREMENTS. AND NOT TO BUILD MORE THAN WHAT IS NEEDED I WANT TO THANK ASEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO MOVE US TOWARDS REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND MAKING HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. I KNOW THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP US ACHIEVE OUR GOALS OF ADDRESSING THE INTERLOCKING ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT MAKER PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMIR KHAN AND I'M A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH RELATED CALIFORNIA AND I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE COUNCIL INFILL BUILDERS ONE OF THE BILL'S CO SPONSORS- I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING AND BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI FORTINO ONE. AS YOU HEARD- FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN MOST JURISDICTIONS STILL REQUIRE EXCESSIVE ONSITE MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT AND BUSINESSES WHETHER THEY'RE NEAR TRANSIT OR OR NOT- IT TENDS TO BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ON SITE PARKING REDUCES THE HOUSING SUPPLY BY FRANKLY TAKING UP VALUABLE SPACE THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BUILD. HOME PROVIDING ONSITE PARKING AS YOU HEARD IS A VERY EXPENSIVE DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PARKING YOU KNOW WE TYPICALLY WILL- ESTIMATE PARKING TO COST BETWEEN THIRTY AND. THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STATE BILL. A NEW CAR TO PASS DIRECTLY. ON TO HOUSE THE- IN DEVELOPER. RENTERS AND HOMEBUYERS MAKING HOUSING THINK. AGAIN LAY MORE EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE OWN IMPRESS. ANY DECADE OLD MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS FRANKLY MAKE IT COST PROHIBITIVE FOR ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT TO OCCUR NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESSES BUT ALSO NEED TO ADAPT TO OUR CHANGING. EIGHTY FORTINO ONE WOULD REDUCE THE OVER OF PARKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN TURN THE BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA REDUCE TRAFFIC REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ENCOURAGE TRANSIT USAGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL REDUCE THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING TO RENTERS HOMEOWNERS AND DEVELOPERS YOUR HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. AND IT WILL ALSO HELP TO CREATE REVITALIZED AND PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY WALKABLE COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS IN DOWNTOWN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT PROPERTY OWNERS FROM BUILDING ON SITE PARKING RATHER AS YOU BIRDS IT GIVES DEVELOPERS FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE. ON HOW MUCH PARKING IS SUITABLE FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN STICKING TO THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATES. WHILE SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING BOLD STEPS LIKE BERKELEY TO REDUCE FEES UP PARKING MINIMUMS DOING SO AND IN MANY PLACES IN NOT ONLY BE EXPENSIVE BUT POLITICALLY CHALLENGING- ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE CLOSURE OF MANY RESTAURANTS SMALL SHOPS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TEMPORARY ALLOWED BUSINESSES TO UTILIZE ONSITE AND STREET PARKING SPACE. TO EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS OUTDOORS. LONDON FROM. OF STEAKS OUTDOOR DINING AND SHOPPING AS PROVEN THROUGH WITH ALL THAT THERE ARE. MORE PRODUCTIVE USES FOR EMPTY PARKING SPACES SHOWING US A NEW WAY FORWARD THAT CREATEA MORE INVITING AND SUSTAINABLE CALIFORNIA THIS CALL. MALL BUSINESSES.

GREAT THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT ACKNOWLEDGING SOONER. OKAY LET'S SEE WE HAVE OUT THERE DO YOU WANT IN OPPOSITION FOR THIS BILL. OPERATORS ARE ANYWAY AND WHEN YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. DO YOU IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION OF AB FORTINO ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO IN OPPOSITION. AND OPPOSITION THANK YOU AT THE TIME MANAGER GREAT THANK YOU- OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ON EARTH. I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I SEE THAT YOU HAVE SOME VERY VALID ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PARKING- IS. REDUCED TO THAT HOW THAT GENERATES DEMAND FOR TRANSIT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE TO SAY MY DISTRICT IS OUR TRANSIT IS VERY LOW QUALITY. WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING WHICH IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT. REDUCING THE PARKING MINIMUMS DOWNTOWN CREATES A MASSIVE PROBLEM THAT WILL TAKE TEN TO TWENTY YEARS TO DO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FUNCTIONAL TRANSIT THAT SO MANY OF THE CALLERS FROM THE BAY AREA FROM LA FROM EVEN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. ALREADY ENJOY SO ONE OF MY QUOTE YOU KNOW QUESTIONS MAYBE WE AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THIS IS YOUR BILL DOESN'T IN MY MIND PROPERLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN QUALITY TRANSIT AT WHAT POINT THEN THESE PARKING MINIMUM- DISREGARD BECOMES VALID. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE TRAIN STATIONS ALL ALONG THE COAST. BUT YOU CANNOT GET FROM A TO B. AT ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION ANYWHERE ELSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO YOU YOU CAN'T EVEN IN MY CITY IF YOU LIVE DOWNTOWN GET TO A GROCERY STORE. YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO TO A VERY EXPENSIVE ONE SO THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL RIGHT NOW AND IF WE DON'T TIE REDUCTION OF PARKING MINIMUMS TO INCREASE IN TRANSIT FUNDING FOR THOSE AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE FUNCTION TRANSIT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING A PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CREATE SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS I DO HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD DO SPECIFICALLY IN MY DISTRICT. IN SUBURBAN DISTRICTS GENERALLY WHO DO NOT WHO WOULD MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS IN YOUR BILL FOR THE PARKING REDUCTIONS YET DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS OF EFFECTIVELY INCREASING. OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT NETWORK. THANK YOU I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONCERN AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS- THAT FEEL THAT THE BILL- MIGHT. HAVE YOU KNOW DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. I WOULD SAY THAT. FINDING WAYS OF SPRING COMMUNITIES TO DO BETTER LOCAL TRANSIT WHEN YOU HAVE RAIL IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE BILL AS WELL. AS CHAIR TRANSPORTATION I'M ALSO VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING MORE FUNDING FOR TRANSIT IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING YOURS BUT VERY HAPPY. THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING IS A LONG WAY TO GO AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE DOING YOU KNOW WORK ON THIS BILL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AND THANK YOU FOR VOICING THEM. OTHER QUESTIONS. REMAIN LACKING. YEAH THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO HAVE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM OCEANSIDE. BUT IN THE SAME RIGHT AT. I DIDN'T HEAR YOU ACCEPTED MEMBERS. I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. ACCESS FOR THE HANDICAPPED I GUESS I DID ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND THE BEGINNING OF AND I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. SO THERE WILL BE THE HANDICAP WILL BE PROVIDED AND HE BE CHARGING THIS WHILE I'M ON I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME CLARITY ON WHAT. HOW YOUR BILL ADDRESSES THE HANDICAPPED. WITH THE AMENDMENT WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN- YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENT CAME FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF SO I. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT'S WORDED I'D ACTUALLY HAVE TO PULL THE BILL OUT AND TAKE A LOOK MAYBE- I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE A STAFFER HERE YOU KNOW WHO CAN HELP ME BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A COMMITTEE STAFFER FROM- FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. WE CAN GET YOU THE ANSWERS AS WELL AND ONCE AGAIN AND I'M GONNA LET THE CHAIR BUT WE ARE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO NEED PARKING. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES HAPPEN BUT- CHAIR DID YOU WANT TO HELP US WITH THAT. I'M I CAN DO THAT IN A SECOND BUT WELL I CAN DO NOW- THIS TOO WAS AN ISSUE FOR ME AND SO- WE- WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE THE ADA PARKING STANDARDS SO. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER STATE POLICIES ENSURING THAT WE DO NOT BACKSLIDE ON REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. SPACES ACCESSIBLE TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO WE DID PUT SOMETHING IN ADDRESS THAT IN. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SO THEY'LL HAVE TO STILL PROVIDE THE EIGHTY PARKING SPACES THAT WE WOULD. HAVE HAD TO PROVIDE A WOULD ONE CENT. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS. BATHROOM WELL NOT ONLY THAT BUT I MEAN I I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT FOR NUMBER REASONS- BY ONE OF THE MOST. WAS THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY DISABLED FOR LESS LIVING YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND REQUIRED. HE WAS NON AMBULATORY SUMMIT HAD NEVER WILL CHAIR EVERY WENT AND MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT. AND WHEN THERE'S NOT. ADEQUATE PARKING THEIR LIVES ARE MINIMIZED SUBSTANTIALLY SO. THANK YOU YEAH AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR POINTING THAT OUT TO US AND WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE ADA SPACES THAT ARE REQUIRED- LEGALLY. WILL BE REQUIRED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. YES- ONCE AGAIN IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PROBLEM I. HAVE A VERY RURAL DISTRICT BUT ALSO ABOUT 60% OF IT. OUR YOUNG GROWING CITIES WITH LIGHT RAIL THROUGH THEM. SO THOSE CITIES TEND TO LIKE PARKING. AND THEY REQUIRE EXTRA PARKING. IN THE PARKING SPACES- EVEN BIGGER BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT DISTRICT. DR LARGE TRUCKS THEN IF THEY GOT A GIANT SMELLY DIESEL TRUCK IT'S EVEN FUNNIER FORM SO- WHAT I'M THINKING IS WOULD THERE POSSIBLY BE AN AMENDMENT- THAT WE COULD DO- THAT WOULD EXEMPT. CITIES A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND BELOW. FROM THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE I'M I'M SPOT ON WITH YOUR OF FOR. THE GIANT URBAN AREAS I MEAN SAN FRANCISCO LA SAN JOSE. GOT IT THIS IS A GREAT BILL BUT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER SMALLER AREAS MAY NOT BE SO GOOD SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO. IF POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU AND WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO TALK TO ANY MEMBER AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR EVERYONE I WILL SAY THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL. OF PROHIBITS DEVELOPERS ARE ADDING PARKING AND THE EXPERIENCE MOTHER CITIES HAS BEEN THAT THE DEVELOPERS WANT PEOPLE TO USE THEIR DEVELOPMENT- AND WHEN THEY'RE LEFT TO THEIR OWN YOU KNOW THE FREE MARKET I WILL SAY WORKS IN A LOT OF CASES AND FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE BUILDING HIGH END LUXURY APARTMENTS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO PROVIDE MORE PARKING THAT I WOULD LIKE THEM TO PROVIDE. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THE UNITS WILL READ FOR A LESSER AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS IS REALLY GOING TO HELP THOSE MIDDLE CLASS DEVELOPMENTS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO AIM AT THE MORE COST CONSCIOUS YOU KNOW YOUNGER PEOPLE WORKING YOU KNOW WORKING PEOPLE. AND IN AREAS WHERE THEY KNOW THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA SHOW UP IN A PICKUP TRUCK. THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE THE HOME DEPOT DOWN THE BLOCKS GOT THE SPACES I'M GOING TO ADD THE SPACES HERE OR THE CITIES CAN HELP THEM BY BUILDING A MUNICIPAL PARKING LOT THE DOWNTOWN CITY OF GLENDALE HAS THREE YES THREE OR FOUR MUNICIPAL LOTS AND IT'S DOWNTOWN. IT'S ALLOWED FOR A REALLY VIBRANT MAIN STREET FEELING THAT EVERYBODY LOVES AND THE SMALL MOM AND POPS. YOU KNOW THEY CAN OPEN THEIR LITTLE SHOP WITHOUT HAVING TO PROVIDE ALL THE PARKING THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE REQUIRED IT'S REALLY WORKED OUT WELL SO CITIES HAVE OPTIONS TO HELP WITH THAT MANAGEMENT SHARED PARKING. THAT'S WHAT BUFFALO FOUND BUFFALO IS NOT A HUGE CITY I USED TO LIVE NEAR THERE IN ROCHESTER AND WHEN THEY TOOK AWAY THE PARKING FROM THEIR CITY VERY CLEARLY THEY FOUND THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE ACTUALLY SHARING AND SAYING HEY LET'S LET'S SHARE THIS PARKING TOGETHER SO THERE'S A LOT OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CASE WHERE THE MARKET'S GOING TO HELP WITH THAT- AND. PEOPLE WANT THE PROJECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT WILL WE WILL WORK WITH YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WAS LAUGHING A LITTLE BIT DURING THE LAST DISCUSSION BECAUSE I HAVE A THREE CITIES UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND- AND IN MY DISTRICT- AND THEY'RE ALL VERY DENSE AND TO MOST OF THEM ARE A 100% WOULD PROBABLY QUALIFY- AS BEING WITHIN A HALF MILE OF TRANSIT SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LANGUAGE WE WANT TO CRAFTED VERY CAREFULLY BUT- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT POLICY IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POLICY DISCUSSION WE HAVE BEEN. OVER PARKING AND BUILDING TOO MUCH PARKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND IT HAS- YOU KNOW IT'S IN LARGE PART A RESPONSE TO PEOPLE BEING AFRAID OF DEVELOPMENT- FEAR OF DEVELOPMENT HAS LED TO- ACIVIR CONSTRAINT ON THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WE HAVE BOTH MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- PARTICULARLY- HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS AND IT IS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT HOUSING COSTS ARE HIGH BUT IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE DRIVERS SO THE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE- THESE UP UP UP PARKING GOT REQUIREMENTS- IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FORCE. I WILL- POINT OUT THAT- WE LEARNED IN DOWNTOWN THAT WOULD NOT DOWNTOWN IN THE- BERGAMOT STATIONARY OF FIVE OF SANTA MONICA FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT- THAT THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF UNUSED PARKING SPACES- PRIMARILY IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN THAT AREA- BUT WHEN A STUDY WAS DONE THEY WERE JUST YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE BEEN THIS BILL THEY HAVE BEEN SO OVER PARKED THAT THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF SPACES THAT WERE GOING ON USED. EVERY DAY WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY- AND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING- WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO LOWER THE COST IS IMPORTANT THE OTHER ONE CONCERN I HAVE AND- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT- IT'S NOT GONNA AFFECT MY BOOK TODAY- BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME- AND I HAVE TO SAY HAVING GOT- AMIR KHAN THIS AS YOUR WITNESS- GOOD GIVES GREAT CREDIBILITY- TO- YOUR ARGUMENT IS THE AUTHOR ON THIS. OTHER IT WON'T AFFECT A- THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT SOME OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS ARE EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS- PRIMARILY BECAUSE- IT IT IT'S- UNFORTUNATE- AFFIRMATIVE. OF FROM THE- OF THIS ISSUE OF OVER PARKING BUT- PARKING IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NEGOTIATED. WHEN IT COMES TO DENSITY BONUSES AND- PENCILING OUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS- SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- OF THESE POLICIES ARE NOT IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER- BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH. OBVIOUSLY A HOUSING PRODUCTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED IN YOUR PRESENTATION ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL- SO- WITH- WITH THAT ONE ISSUE- HANGING OUT THERE- WHICH I HOPE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. I'M HAPPY SUPPORT THE BILL AND I MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE SAYING NINE- WE- WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND FROM- ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'LL JUST SAY THAT IT'S VERY IRONIC WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS AT RIGHT NOW IN LOS ANGELES THEY'RE LITERALLY USING UNUSED PARKING CAPACITY TO. PUT TENTS UP TO PUT HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THIS IS THESE ARE THIS IS LAND THAT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOUSING GOING WAY BACK AND THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MOVE CARS TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE ENOUGH JUST UNDER UTILIZED AN UNUSED LAND THAT'S JUST LITERALLY OCEANS OF CONCRETE- WE NEED TO REPRIORITIZE WE NEED TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND I'M SURE THAT WE CAN NO THE REST WILL SORT OUT AND INVEST IN TRANSIT ALL OVER OUR STATE TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND IN A WAY THAT'S MORE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT I WOULD REQUEST AND I BOTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID YOU. TAKE THE AMENDMENTS YES I COULD BE A MEMBERS AGREED TO SO MAKE SURE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING WITHOUT NEW FUNDING. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT MANY OF THE PARKING STANDARDS THAT EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE LED TO OVER DEVELOPMENT. OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL PARKING. WITH PARKING IF YOUR- IT THEY WILL COME. ADDING MORE PARKING MEASURABLY INCREASES DEMAND FOR VEHICLE PARTNERSHIP. WHICH CAN FRUSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. REDUCING PARKING REQUIREMENTS AROUND TRANSIT AREAS CAN MAKE. HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES MORE WALKABLE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ENSURE THE BILL RECOGNIZE EXISTING EVEY AND ADA PARKING STANDARDS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIKE HE HAD ALSO. REQUIRED THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR CONSISTENCY WITH OUR STATE POLICIES IN ASSURING THEM. YOU DO NOT BACKSLIDE ON THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ENSURE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPACES ARE ACCESSIBLE. TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A MAN TO HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AGUILAR KERRY HI. AND YOUR KERRY IRAQI. BLACKIE NOT BOW. BLUE BLOOM I. BOERNER HORVATH RAMOS RAMOS I THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS HI ROBERT RIVERSIDE VOEPEL VOEPEL ALL RIGHT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE FIVE ZERO. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FIVE ALSO. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL SIX ZERO TWO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE DETAILS OF THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT PROCESS AND HOW WE ARRIVED AT THIS POINT. THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF EXTENDED NEGOTIATIONS WITH A WORKING GROUP COMPOSED OF CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS UTILITIES AFFORDABLE AND MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THROUGH A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS FIVE DISCUSSIONS ACTUALLY WE ARRIVED AT SEVERAL CONCEPTS THAT I BELIEVE PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY WHILE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FUND THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SERVE NEW HOUSING THESE CONCEPTS ARE ALSO SUPPORTED BY A ROBUST RESEARCH FROM UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER ON HOUSING INNOVATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE WORKING GROUP FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS IS TRULY AN EXAMPLE OF HOW DIVERSE INTEREST CAN WORK THROUGH THEIR DIFFERENCES TO CREATE A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY NOW ON TO THE BILL AB SIX ZERO TWO IT ESTABLISHES TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS FOR THE NEXUS STUDIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PREPARE WHEN IMPOSING DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES V. THESE INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STATE THEIR EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE PROVIDED A CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN FOR PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND COMPLY WITH PUBLIC NOTICE AND OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL WILL TIE FEES MORE CLOSELY TO THE ACTUAL IMPACTS OR NEW DEVELOPMENT BY REQUIRING OR FORTY DEVELOPER BY REQUIRING THAT FEES BE PROPORTIONATE TO THIS WE'RE- OF A PROPOSED UNIT OR UNITS. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF THIS POLICY IS THAT THE VOTERS WILL BE GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO DIVIDE OR SUB DIVIDE PROJECTS INTO SMALLER MORE NATURALLY AFFORDABLE UNITS. THIS BILL ALSO DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP A TEMPLATE FOR NEXUS STUDIES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MADE SHOES TWO YEARS M. MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE WAY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS POSTER IMPACT THESE ONLINE. RECENT AMENDMENTS NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL THE ONLY AFFECT FEES REGULATED BY THE MITIGATION FEE ACT STRENGTHENED AND CLARIFIED THE REQUIREMENTS TO CALCULATE FEES BY SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND INCORPORATE SEVERAL BEST PRACTICES SUGGESTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES. COMMITTEE COMMITMENTS WILL LIMIT THE REQUIREMENT TO UTILIZE A CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN TO LARGE JURISDICTIONS THAT WOULD BE COUNTIES OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION. AND TO MAKE OTHER TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING CHANGES TAKEN TOGETHER THESE COMMONSENSE REFORMS WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENCY CLARITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE WAY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DETERMINED DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT FEES. HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS BILL AND IT'S IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS R. DAVID GARCIA POLICY DIRECTOR AT UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION. AND LAURIE FEILER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT SAN DIEGO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. OPERATOR THE SUPPORTERS PLEASE GIVE OPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR AUDITORS AND ACCOUNTING DIVISION UC BERKELEY WHICH IS A RESEARCHER POLICY CENTER FOCUSED ON ALL MATTERS OF HOUSING ISSUES THE LAND USE REFORM TO INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES TO THE HIGH COST OF BUILDING NEW HOMES. TODAY I'M HERE TO LIFT UP SOME OF OUR RECENT WORK ON DEVELOPINGIMPACT FEES AND HOW EIGHTY SIX OH TWO ALIGNS WITH SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- THIS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THAT WE PUBLISHED THREE UNIQUE PIECE THE RESEARCH ON THIS EXACT TOPIC WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPED PARTNER THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. WE DON'T FEES ARE VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR CITIES LOOKING TO MITIGATE THE REAL IMPACT OF NEW HOUSING THE BUT BECAUSE CITIES ARE GENERALLY CONSTRAINED ON HOW WE CAN RAISE REVENUE FOR THINGS LIKE PARKS AND ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE. WBZ ARE OFTEN TIMES THE ONLY WAY SOME OF THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS CAN GET FUNDED IT ISALSO TRUE THAT FEES ARE NOT ALWAYS CALCULATED OR ENCLOSED IN TRANSPARENT OR EQUAL. MATTERS WHICH MAY LEAD TO. ONLY BY FEE AMOUNTS ON YOUR- WHICH- SHOWS CLEARLY. ULTIMATELY UP. THE FOR THAT NEW HOME- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE HOME PRICES ARE. REALLY CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. AND OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SIMPLE CHANGES IN THE CALCULATION IN THE POSITION. OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES CAN MORE PROPERLY ALIGNED HE SEES. WITH THE ACTUAL IMPACTS. WHILE ALSO LOWERING DEVELOPMENT COSTS OVERALL- FOR EXAMPLE. THAT SHIFTING TO A PER SQUARE FOOT CALCULATION FOR CERTAIN FEES RATHER THAN- J. A PER UNIT BASIS WHICH IS WHAT MANY TO DETECT- THAT CAN. IN SOME CASES MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE NEW ATTACKS THE RESULT IN MORE RECENT COST- IT IS CHANGE ALSO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLUDED TO IT DOESN'T AND INTENTIONALLY PUNISH SMALL UNIT DEVELOPMENT. AS WE SEE TODAY IN THE CITY THAT YOU THEY KERR UNIT CALCULATION- AND SO EIGHTY SIX OH TWO MAKES IT PRETTY SIMPLE CHANGE. ALSO ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN INSTANCES WHERE AS YOU CHANGE MAY. NOT BE POSSIBLE OR OR ACTIVITY JUST SO. AGAIN A CALCULATION IN A POSITION OF IMPACT THESE IS A REALLY TECHNICAL COMPLEX PROCESS BUT THEIR PROPER CALCULATION IMPLEMENTATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE REASONABLE AND TRULY REFLECTIVE OF THE IMPACT WILL GROW HELLO- THIS BILL TAKES. OF REASON THAT TOWARDS BRINGING MORE TRANSPARENCY AND BEST PRACTICES TO DIVIDING. THE THESES- IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE FOR SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGES PROPOSED BELT AND I'D LIKE TO ATTEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THE ISSUE- AGAIN IT'S COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL TECHNICAL BUT. IT IS REALLY NEEDED SO I'M ALSO- JUST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND THEN YOU THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE OR- FOR HAVING COME. NEXT WE'RE. I DON'T KNOW YEAH RIGHT AFTER YES GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND LAURIE FEILER I AM OVER SAN DIEGO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND THE FORMER AND FORMER MAYOR FOR THE CITY OF ESCONDIDO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR TAKING THIS ISSUE ON. WE ALL KNOW THAT. THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN HOUSING CRISIS COMES ABOUT THAT EVERY DAY. AND AS A PORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER CALIFORNIA IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. IMPACT FEES ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR OUR% PROJECT ASK FOR OUR LAST PROJECT IN EL CAJON WE WRITE A CHECK. FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CONNECT WIDER TO FIVE HOMES AND THAT WAS THE IMPACT FEE AS WELL AS PAYING THE DISTRICT OR THE ACTUAL CONNECTION. THAT WAS A HARD CHECK TO WRITE. IN FEES. OVERALL YOU TAKE ALL THE IMPACT ARE CAN BE AS MUCH AS AND ARE. OF THE TOTAL COST TO BUILD AND CRASH THAT MEANS FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. AND THAT DID NOT INCLUDE THE PROCESSING FEES WHICH CAN ALSO ADD UP AND CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE HIGH COST OF BUILDING. AT HABITAT WE ARE SELLING OUR HOMES AT THE AFFORDABLE PRICE TO OUR FAMILIES. OF BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THEY ARE COSTING AT. FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO BUILD AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP WITH THE COST SIDE OF THAT LEDGER- EIGHTY SIX OH TWO PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE FEES ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO- BY CREATING CLEAR GUIDELINES THAT HELP TO CITIES AS WELL. IN A CONTABILIDADE FOR THE NEXT TWO STUDIES- WHILE I WAS THE MAYOR PUBLICITY THAT CAN BE- I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY DEVELOPERS BROUGHT FORWARD HOMES THAT WERE SO LARGE AND COVERAGE SO MUCH OF THE LACK. AT LEAVING ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF VIRTUALLY NO YARD FOR CHILDREN TO PLAY- BUT HE JUST WONDERED WHY ARE WE BUILDING SUCH LARGE HOUSES THEY CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE SO HIGH YOU HAD THE BILL THAT THE FEES STRUCTURE. MEANING HOMES WERE I'VE BEEN IN THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT RANGE AND THAT SITE IS MORE OF YEAR GRADUATED HOMES AFTER. AFTER YOU HAVE PURCHASED YOUR FIRST HOME AND THE NINE HUNDRED TWO ELEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOO RANGE OF THE STRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE BUILDING OF NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WOULD. BE MORE LIKELY. IN THAT NINE HUNDRED TWO ELEVEN HUNDRED. THIS SPELL I READ. THAT HE'S BECAUSE- TO THE SQUARE. OF A PROPOSED UNIT OR UNITS. WILL BE IN EXCELLENT FIRST THAT INCREASE MORE.

WELCOME WELL THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY ON AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT- THIS BILL AND- IS RATHER SIMPLE IN FACT IT'S ABOUT TEN WORDS- AND I IT STRIKES AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT LEADS TO THE BEST ELECTED REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE THIS BILL SIMPLY GUARANTEES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS BY ALLOWING THEM TO STAND FOR REELECTION AND GAIN EXPERTISE ON THE JOB THROUGH A MINIMUM OF TWO ELECTED TERMS IN OFFICE. WHILE ALSO ALLOWING THEM ADEQUATE COMPENSATION SO WE HAVE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES THAT AREN'T JUST INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY BEFORE THEY THEY SERVE. NOW I'M JOINED TODAY BY A JEAN HURST ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS C. SACK TODAY AND ALSO- TERRY BRENNAN ON BEHALF OF SEIU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL HAVING WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOW WE HAVE ONE HERE IN THE GALLERY. THE JUDGE GOING OUT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS TERRY MORAN AND ON BEHALF OF S. YEAH CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH TERM LIMITS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- WE HAVE A VERY- RELATIONSHIP I'VE BEEN FOR AND AGAINST IT BUT IN NO INSTANCE HAVE WE EVER SUPPORTED ANY EFFORTS. TO LIMIT IT TO ONE TERM- THAT PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON INSURE FIT THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL EXPERTISE WE- APPRECIATE WANT TO SEE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN ADDITION B. COMPENSATION LIMIT- PREVENT FOLKS FROM MY UNION BY MEMBERSHIP- THE WORKING CLASS FROM PARTICIPATING IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO WORK SOME OTHER JOB AND HOBBYIST AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THOSE OF YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW VERY WELL IT'S NOT A HOBBY PUBLIC SERVICE IS A FULL TIME HARD WORK A JOB FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR I BELIEVE WE HAVE A COUPLE OTHER SPONSORS JEAN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BLEACHING HER SINCE GENE HEARST PLACE. I'M NOT A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I. ANGIE AND HIRTH- HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTY THE CALIFORNIA A COALITION OF FOURTEEN OF THE STATE'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTIES I IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY EIGHT I WOULD SEEK COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A TERM LIMIT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO TERMS. OF THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIED THAT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESCRIBING COMPENSATION FOR ALL COUNTY OFFICERS INCLUDING THE BOARD THEMSELVES- WELL THEY COUNTY SAN BERNARDINO WAS FACED WITH SOME IMPACT OF ITS RECENTLY APPROVED MEASURE K. THAT MEASURE IS PROSPECTIVE EVAN STATEWIDE IN NATURE IMPORTANTLY- YOU CAN IMAGINE MANY OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MILLER FUTURE MEMBERS. MEASURES THAT SEEK TO PROVIDE A SINGLE TERM LIMIT AND DRAMATICALLY LIMIT COMPENSATION AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE COUNTY GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF LOCAL SERVICES AS WELL AS FEDERAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED ON THE STATE'S BEHALF IN FACT THE RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MAY BE THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THE COMPLEX SET OF SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS COUNTY FOR A MOMENT ON A DAILY BASIS. A SINGLE TERM SIMPLY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERVISOR ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM TWO TERM LIMIT IS BOTH REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL TO ENSURE THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE YOUR COMMITTED ACCOUNTABLE AND CAPABLE OF GOVERNING IN THE MODERN DAY AND UCC STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS MEASURE AND RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU. OPERATOR THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WISH TO SAY SUPPORT ON AB FOUR TO EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE'LL GO TO LINE OF TWO FIFTEEN YEAR LINES OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HOLD LITTLE MAN ON BEHALF OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THE PORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO TO LINE OF TWO SEVENTY SIX YOUR LINES OPEN. NIELSEN JEFF NEWCOME THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT QUEUE RIGHT THANK YOU- THREE HOW MANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JENNIFER IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. WELL BOTTOM LINE OF ONE SEVENTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO THIS IS A SCOTT KAUFMAN FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION- TIMBER NEAR THE MEASURE CAME INTO THE COUNTY CHARTER TO BONE TERM LIMIT OF ONE TERM REDUCE THE TOTAL COMPENSATION PREACHER THE BOARD SURVIVES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT WHEN TERM LIMITS ARE IMPOSED LIMITS BE NO FEWER THAN TWO TERMS IT WOULD ALSO SPECIFY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION COUNTY OFFICERS FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REGARDING PRESCRIBED COMPENSATION IT SEEMS CLEAR TO US THAT AB FOUR TO EIGHT IN DIRECT RESPONSE AMBER IN THE US MEASURE K. WE UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PERSONAL SIMILAR MEASURES. BUT THIS BILL COULD ESTABLISH REASONABLE STANDARDS FOR TERM LIMIT INITIATIVES AND OTHER COUNTIES WITHOUT TRAMPLING ON THE RIGHTS OF A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY VOTERS TO APPROVE MEASURE K. WIN THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON THE MEANING OF SECTION ONE PARAGRAPH THE- PARAGRAPH B. CONTAINS TWO SENTENCES THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE SEPARATELY OPERATIVE A FAX. THE FIRST SENTENCE WE BELIEVE DOESN'T FACT CREAMS LOCAL OTHER INITIATIVES THAT REGULATE THE TERMS THE NUMBER OF TERMS AND A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CONSERVE. THE SECOND SENTENCE NOT AT ISSUE AS WE READ IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT ANY LOCAL INITIATIVE OR LAW WOULD ONLY HAVE A PROSPECTIVE AFFECT AS TO THE CURRENT CITY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THAT'S OUR PRIMARY DISPUTE IS WITH THE FIRST SENTENCE WHICH WE BELIEVE. TRANSLOCATIONS INCLUDING MEASURE K. THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN AND I ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO. ON AB FOUR TO EIGHT. OUR THERE ANY OTHER UP BUT WE- YOU AND BOOK ANY OTHER WITH. NOT WHAT A LOT OF SIXTY FOUR YOUR LINES OPEN. ONE SIXTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HE FROM THE WEB BERMAN GROUP AND- I OPPOSE AB FOUR TO EIGHT THE RED BERMAN GOOD IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT SPONSORED- THIS NATION BUILD. BUT WAS APPROVED BY TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTERS IN MY COUNTY. YEAH I HAVEN'T WAYS TO GIVE CONTROL BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY. AND WE FEEL THAT THIS THAT AB TWO FOUR TWO EIGHT DIRECTLY TARGETS THE VOTERS WILL AND INTENT THEN WE WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO. OPPOSE APPROVAL OF THIS- BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU SOME AMERICA- MAYES FOR A BRING IN THIS ISSUE FORWARD. HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON IT- YOU KNOW AS YOU OPEN UP YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT IT SIMPLE COUPLE LINES SOMETIMES A COUPLE HINDS COULD. LEAD TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT YOU ALSO SENSE THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. ARE MOVING FOR BUT ALSO- THERE'S THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF THE VOTERS RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE TO BE HEARD. BUT MY QUESTIONS- WILL CENTER AROUND. THE BILL AND SOME OF THE CLARIFYING AREAS THAT I WANTED TO GET- CLARIFIED SUCH AS- WHAT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYER. BROUGHT UP IN THIS SECTION BE- BUT IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH YOU TALK ABOUT ANY PROPOSAL TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TERMS THE BOARD MEMBER SUPERVISOR MAY SERVE. ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHALL APPLY APPLY PROSPECTIVELY. MEETING IN THE FUTURE CORRECT. ONLY AND SHALL NOT BECOME OPERATIVE UNLESS IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE ELECTORS OF THE COUNTY AND A REGULAR SCHEDULED ELECTION. AND MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST. ON THAT QUESTION- AND IT'S ADOPTED A FAVORABLE AREA CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT. DOES THAT MEAN THAT ANY TERM LIMITS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE TERM LIMIT. SPECIFICALLY IN SEMINOLE COUNTY THAT THE CALLER'S BROUGHT UP- BUT THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE ELECTORS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT OUR CAN YOU CLARIFY. WHEN THAT PROCESS WILL ACTUALLY GO BACK TO THE LECTORS. SURE HI- AS YOU KNOW I MISS AROUND WITH YOU AND I'VE HAVE- HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME AND- YEAH WHEN I- YOU WERE MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR- IN FACT AND- WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR ANOTHER COUNTY SUPERVISOR YOUR OFFICE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO. WAS RIGHT NEXT TO MINE- YOU ALSO KNOW THAT I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY- AND WHAT YOU WERE- REFERENCING WAS THE SECOND PART OF THE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY WHICH WAS. HAS ALREADY A MATTER OF LAWYER TALK ABOUT WAS PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I THINK THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE IS THE LANGUAGE ARTS AS A PROPOSAL TO LIMIT. TO NUKE NO FEWER THAN- THEN THEN TO TERMS- AND AS WE HAVE WE HAVE DISCUSSED- MY CONCERN- IN REGARDS WHY I'M- I'M CARRYING THIS BILL- IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN FACT WHEN I WAS. THINKING ABOUT COMING BEFORE ALL OF YOU TODAY- I WAS THINKING I THINK EVERY PERSON THAT SERVED THAT SERVING ON THIS- THIS COMMITTEE HAS SERVED. IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I AND I THINK- EITHER COUNTY SUPERVISOR OR OR CITY GOVERNMENT. WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD- BECAUSE I HAD A DEGREE IN GOVERNMENT- I THOUGHT I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS COULDN'T WAIT TO GET. TO IT- TO SIT DOWN AND BE ABLE TO. TAKE TO GET TO WORK AND I REALIZED VERY QUICKLY- THAT- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT- I WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD. AT IT IN FACT I STILL REMEMBER GOING THROUGH MY AGENDA PACKETS OVER THE WEEKEND. AND READING EVERY SINGLE WORD FROM THE BEGINNING. TO THE END AND IT TOOK ME. A GOOD THREE YEARS- WHILE I WAS SERVING ON THAT COUNCIL TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT I WAS DOING WAS PROBABLY FIVE YEARS. I BEFORE I REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE VOTE THAT I WAS TAKING. THE IMPACT THAT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE. NOW I SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY- THAT- HAD- TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT. A BUDGET OF TWELVE MILLION. AND FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND IT TOOK ME AT LEAST FIVE YEARS TO REALLY. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. MY TO COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT A BOTH HAVE NORTH OF TWO MILLION EOPLE COMBINED. THEREFORE THERE ARE FOUR MILLION TWO DIFFERENT BOARDS. IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY AS AN EXAMPLE THERE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND THEY HAVE BUDGETS IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BOTH OF MY- MY COUNTY I SERVED AS THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND DOUG AND WORK FULL TIME. AND I CAN TELL YOU FOR THE TIME THAT I WAS THERE I STILL. DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CHIEF OF STAFF- FULL TIME UNLIKE BEING A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. ALL THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS IT IS AMAZING TO ME IS TO THINK THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM. IN WHICH THE AVERAGE IF WE HAVE ONE TERM. THE AVERAGE TIME FOR SET FOR A FIVE MEMBER BOARD. WOULD B EITHER ONE AND A HALF YEARS ONE POINT SIX TO BE EXACT. OR TWO POINT FOUR YEARS. OF TOTAL TIME SERVING IN THAT CAPACITY. I BELIEVE ELECTED REPRESENTS A REAL ELECTIVE REPRESENTATION. IN FACT I ALSO BELIEVE MY ALSO BELIEVE IN TERM LIMITS. I THINK TERM LIMITS IS APPROPRIATE. BUT FOUR YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION SO WHAT THIS. MEASURE BEFORE YET DOES. IT SAYS. THAT COUNTY SUPERVISORS. WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY DO. THEY CAN SERVE FOR THERE CAN STILL BE LOCAL NEST OF A LOCAL MEASURE TO LIMITED. BUT THEY CAN SERVE FOR AT LEAST. TWO TERMS THE TOTAL OF EIGHT YEARS. VERY VERY SIMPLE THANK YOU MEMBER SIDE OF THE TECHNICAL. WAS WITH THE GO BACK TO THE LECTORS AS- IT'S ALLUDED TO IN SECTION B. OF YOUR BILL. AND I'M TAKING THAT THE ANSWERS NOW- THE LANGUAGE HERE- IN MY BILL- IS VERY CLEAR I THINK- IF I CAN MISTER RAMOS YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT SAMBAR DINO COUNTY NON SPEAKING TO YOUR BILL- MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MR MAYS AND SECTION AGAIN B. THE SECOND PART OF IT SAYS ANY PROPOSAL TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TERMS OF A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAY SERVE- ON THE BOARD- ONLY AND SHALL NOT BECOME OPERATIVE UNLESS IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE ELECTORS. OF THE COUNTY AT A REGULAR SCHEDULED ELECTION IN THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST ON THE QUESTION FAVOR THE ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSAL SO MY QUESTION- MISTER MASON- AND YOU DID ALLUDE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT- I'M NOT EITHER AND I'M READING YOUR BILL. INTO ME I'M READING THAT THAT WOULD GO BACK TO THE ELECTORS OR OR NO THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION. IN A SPECIFIC TO YOUR BILL. FOR THE DAY EIGHT I THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING IS THE LANGUAGE THAT IS ALREADY A MATTER OF. OF LAW MY BILL ONLY DEALS WITH A LINE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE WHERE IT SAYS TO NO FEWER. THAN TWO TERMS. THE WHOLE SECTION OF BE APPLIES IN THE FILES TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YEAH WELL I'M TALKING TO SO I WOULD. TAKE IT I WOULD I DID NOT CORRECT THAT WOULD BE I'D BE HAPPY I'M NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF SOMEBODY FROM THE COMMITTEE. MADAM CHAIR COULD COULD ASSIST WITH THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE- A MORE EXPERTISE THERE. YEAH I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO COST SAVING GET THAT CLARIFIED I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME. THEY FIND OUT. MANAGER WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO ON TO MY NEXT QUESTION IS WEEK FROM CLOSURE YOU'RE MORE THAN HALF OR WOULD YOU RATHER HOLD NOT DISCARDED THAT'S BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING THANK YOU- FOR THAT- AND AS WE GET THAT CLARIFIED. THAT IT WOULD GO BACK TO THAT- A LECTOR SOME HOPING THAT THAT'S THE CLARIFYING POINT. THE NEXT PART OF YOUR BILL TALKS ABOUT- THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. PRESCRIBE THE COMPENSATION. OF COUNTY- WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY OFFICERS WHICH MEANS IN THE COUNTIES- THE ASSESSOR THE SHERIFF IN THOSE DIFFERENT ELECTIVES THERE. THAT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON THE G. SO ELOQUENTLY TALKED ABOUT THAT I SAT ON IN EUROPE. CHIEF OF STAFF- AND IT TOOK YOU SO MANY YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT. WORKS RIGHT BUT WE DID HAVE STAFF IN THE ORGANIZATION THAT NEW. RIGHT BUT IT TALKS ABOUT NOW WITH YOUR BILL. INCLUDING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BRINGING THAT INTO- THE FAULT AS SETTING. THEIR SALARY AND NO WERE MENTIONING IN THIS SECTION OF TWENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED. DOES IT TALK ABOUT GOING TO THE ELECTORS. AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT CORRECT- THAT. PORTION IS CLARIFYING OF. OF EXISTING LONG WHEN USED SO THAT'S THE COMMA SO ITS OFFICERS COM INCLUDING THE BOARD. OF SUPERVISORS- OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- MY UNDERSTANDING IS UNLESS THERE'S A LOCAL- LOCAL INITIATIVES MMHM- THAT THAT- IS DIFFERENT FROM THIS THEN THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ARE ALREADY- HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH- THERE BUT THERE COMPENSATION- AND- AND I'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE THERE AS WELL MR ALMOST AS WELL AS A SECTION B. THAT I BROUGHT UP. THEY HAVE SOME CONCERNS THERE ALSO. WELL I MEAN DOES WELL I'LL BE HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO THAT SECOND PART BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN A GIVEN THAT- THAT PART BY MUCH MUCH THOUGHT I WISH THAT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. THE OTHER DAY INTERVIEW IT BROUGHT THAT THAT TO MY ATTENTION SHORT SO I COULD HAVE HAD ANSWERS FOR YOU. WELL TODAY BUT ON THE ON THE LEFT. ON ON THE LAST- A PART THAT IS JUST CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. THANK YOU AND- WE DID TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL I SAID. THAT MY QUESTIONS HERE WOULD. CENTER AROUND YOUR BILL IN THE STATE WIDE. IMPACT WE HAD CONVERSATIONS OF DIRECT- MICROPROSE TWO SEMINAL COUNTY ITSELF AND WE AGREED THAT. THAT THAT IS SOMETHING IS THERE BUT I'M NOT SURE WE COULD- TOTALLY DIGRESS FROM TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SALARY INPUT TO IT. BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. ARE MANY HAVE AROUND LOCAL INITIATIVES. AND YOURSELF KNOWING- IN SAN MARINO COUNTY THAT. THE DISK OF SALARIES HAS ONE THAT HAS BEEN A HEATED DEBATE NOT JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT GOES FARTHER BACK INTO WHERE I CAN REMEMBER TWO THOUSAND FIVE. AND THEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS COMPETING MEASURES THAT TOOK PLACE THAT ULTIMATELY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS INITIATIVE ONE THAT. ONE THAT WITH A CLOSER- CLOSER PERCENTAGE THAN THIS LAST ONE. IN A TWENTY TWENTY CAME THE COMPETING MEASURES THAT SET THIS FORWARD. SO IT SHOWS A PATTERN OF THE PEOPLE YOU STARTED OFF WITH YOUR WITH YOUR- TOPIC IN YOUR TESTIMONY. THAT IS A DEMOCRATIC. INSTITUTIONAL RIGHT BUT I. COUNTER AND SAY THAT IT'S ALSO A DEMOCRATIC RIGHT FOR THE VOTERS OF THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE. THINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE SEE HERE THAT A PATTERN HAS BEEN SET. A PATTERN HAS BEEN SET YEAH AND THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE OF SETTING SALARIES SO WHY. AND I'M STILL WAITING FOR CLARIFICATION ON B. AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT WOULD GO BACK TO THE ELECTORATE BECAUSE THAT HELPS SOME. BUT ON SECTION TWENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED THERE'S NO MENTION OF IT WHEN WE KNOW THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE LOCAL LOCAL CONTROL AT ITS FINEST. IS THE DEFINITION OF SENDING THAT SALARY WHICH THE TAXPAYERS OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES PAY INTO THAT GENERAL FUND TO PAY THE SALARIES OF THOSE SUPERVISORS AND I'M SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE A VOICE. A COMPONENT FOR THEM TO BE HEARD SUCH AS THE PATTERN THAT WAS SET IN SAMBAR. THIS LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT VOICE IS BEING HEARD- AGREE WITH YOU MISTER ALMOST IN FACT AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS- AS YOU KNOW THERE HAD BEEN SOME ISSUES IN THE PAST- IN REGARDS TO YOU- SOME OF THE LOCAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO- DECIDED- THAT THEY WOULD- REYES THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION- IN TERMS OF HEALTH BENEFITS AND OTHER THINGS TO TRY TO PAD- THERE. OTHER SALARIES- I DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LIMITS TO WHAT- COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN DECIDE THAT THEIR OWN PAY- SHOULD BE AND SO YOU AND I ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT- ON THAT THAT THAT MAY BE AS WE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE CAN- WE CAN WORK ON THAT- YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME SOME LIMITS SO THERE ARE BAD ACTORS- THE DATE THAT WE'VE GOT SOME CONTROLS THAT ARE THERE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT. ALSO MEMBER- BUT WE KNOW THAT- THAT THIS CHECK A BALANCE OF THE LOCAL GUY IS THE VOTE THE P. MUCH SO THAT TERM LIMITS HE HERE IN THE STATE LET. WAS OUT WITHIN A- START IN THIS BY IN THE- THAT WE TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON TERM LIMITS AS EARLY AS TWO NINE. AND THEN LATER ON- STARTED AND WENT BACK AGAIN TO THE ACA PROCESS HERE TO GO BACK TO THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THAT VOTE ON TERM LIMITS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ARE UNDER NOW WITH THE TWELVE YEAR CYCLE. SO THE POINT IS IT'S NOT ABOUT. IN MY ARGUMENT IS NOT JUST ABOUT SAMBAR DINO COUNTY MY ARGUMENT IS ABOUT THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM INGRAINED SO THAT THEY COULD BETTER- TRUST THE GOVERNMENT THAT SERVES THEM WHEN WE START TO SET OUR OWN SALARIES WHEN WE START TO SET. AREAS BECAUSE CERTAIN ELECTIONS DIDN'T GO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHEN THERE'S A PATTERN AND WE COME STRAIGHT TO THE STATE THERE'S A PROBLEM ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT WE SAT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD WE BLAMED. THE COUNTY FOR A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WERE AFFECTING US ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE BLAME THE STATE FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE HAPPENING HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WERE WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REIMBURSE US ON CERTAIN THINGS. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL CITY COUNCILS HAVE ORDINANCES INVOLVES TO SET UP THE SALARY FOR MAYOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. AND I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE THE SAME IN THIS SITUATION AND WE'RE WAITING FOR CLARITY ON THAT SECTION B. AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT THAT GO BACK TO THE ELECTORATE FOR A VOTE BECAUSE WE'RE CLEAR. RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES THAT. TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED DOES NOT EVEN. MENTION GOING BACK. TO THE ELECTORATES. I'M SO. WHAT'S WE DO REFERRING TO THEIR MANAGER CAN WE GET CLEAR IS WE HAVE CLARIFICATION ON SO BE I HAVE. THE MIKE COME SINCE THAT. SO ONE I CAN RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE LOW GO. SO TALKING LOCAL. IF THIS SORT OF. IN ELECTIONS THEY ARE STUDENTS ON THE ELECT PROCESS WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT BUT LET'S SEE WHERE MISS ROSS IS WITH THIS. AS OF RIGHT NOW LOOKING. THAT'S A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS ONE BECAUSE ON. IF THIS GIFT TO GO TO A LOT. AND THEN THE WHERE. THE NITTY GRITTY IN THE LAW FOR LIKE MAY BE THE PLACE TO ADDRESS PORSCHE OF IT I UNDERSTAND MISTER. RAMOS YOUR CAN FROM- SOME MATTER CHAIR- WHAT WERE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE REYES I THINK THIS WAS A TO THE BELL- THE WILL THE PEOPLE WE SINCE. OPPOSITE BLATTER'S COME THROUGH- THAT ON THE HOWARD- JARVIS TAXPAYER A SENSE OF NO WORSE THE STRIP VOTER OF THE- TO. THEIR PER LINE OF TERM AND SET HEY OF COUNTY SUPER. BECAUSE WE THE OUTCOME. OF AN ELECTION. THIS IS A- A CHILD FOR ME BECAUSE- IN THE FORM LOCAL. THE VOICE OF THE P. WHAT MOVE FOR THEY- US TO THE OFFICE WERE IN. I WOULD. THESE THESE THESE ARE TROUBLESOME FOR ME- TO EVEN VOTE ON TODAY. AND SO WITHOUT CLARIFYING SOME OF THESE SIMPLE QUESTIONS ARE TWO LINER THAT YOU SAID WAS JUST A COUPLE SECONDS SEE A COUPLE SENTENCES COULD LEAD TO A LOT MORE DISCUSSION. THAT I WOULD- RESPECTFULLY THE VOTING NO ON THIS BILL. WELL LET'S THANK YOU AS FROM A SE- AND I- YOU YOU GOT ALL TO THIS- THIS JOB JUST LIKE I GOT A- THIS JOB IN. I DON'T ACTUALLY- VERY MUCH OF. WHEN THERE IS DISSENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THAT DISSENT- MAKES OUR OUR LEGISLATION. A BETTER TOO MANY TIMES IN FACT THAT WE RUN BILLS THROUGH COMMITTEE WE DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION SO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND REALLY DIGGING INTO THIS AND- SO I WASN'T BE ABLE TO ABLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THOSE ANSWERS- FOR YOU ON- WHAT'S A MATTER OF EXISTING EXISTING LAWN AS THIS MOVE PARK FOR THIS BILL PROGRESSES- HOPEFULLY- THROUGH THE NEXT COMMITTEE MAYBE WE CAN WORK WITH THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK FOR. THE FROM. BACK HERE A CRUSH. YEAH I JUST AFTER THAT- THANK OF. I JUST TO GIVE YOU A CHECK TO THE CONCERN. THE ARRAY ABOUT PROPER. THE PROPOSAL MEASURE K. I'M SURE YOU HAVE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT YEAH NO I MEAN I THINK THAT THE VOTE THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN IN FACT I WAS WATCHING A LITTLE BIT- IN REGARDS TO ONE OF THE BILLS- BEFORE YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT LOCAL MEASURES AND AS I WAS LIKE CALL LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE THESE CONVERSATIONS- HERE HERE HERE TODAY. OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU ON THAT THAT IS CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE- AT THE PROSPECTIVE LEE- IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME WHETHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA- THAT WE HAVE- A FIVE MEMBER BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I THAT WILL HAVE AN AVERAGE OF ONE AND A HALF TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS CEMEX MATTOON I HAVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND THEN THEY'RE GONE. IF THAT'S GOOD FOR GOVERNMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WOULD SUGGEST T YOU- THAT- I DON'T- AND- AND DO I THINK AS A MATTER OF POLICY HERE FOR THE STATE I SHOULD BE PUT IN SOME PARAMETERS- TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT PEOPLE'S VOICES CAN BE HEARD THROUGH THE LOCAL INITIATIVE A PROCESS ABSOLUTELY- THIS. BILL BEFORE YOU SAYS- THAT- THAT PROSPECTIVELY THAT OUT IF THERE'S THESE MEASURES THAT COME UP LOCAL MEASURES THAT COME UP- THAT THEY WILL- THEY CAN LIMIT THE TERMS OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS BUT FOR NO LESS THAN- THAN THAN TWO TERMS AND I THINK THAT MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE SO- YOU KNOW IF WE NEED SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE OF WE NEED TO GET SOME ATTORNEYS AND LAWYERS TO GET IN TO TALK ABOUT THE NITTY GRITTY. I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND AS IF YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS MR MR LACKEY OR SOME SOME QUESTIONS NEED I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU AND ANY LEGAL COUNSEL TO TRY TO GET THAT THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING ON THIS ON THIS BILL- THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW THAT WHEN THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT COMES BEFORE. IT'S USUALLY THE FIRST HEARING- WE WILL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT TO THE- TO. THAT APPOINTMENT MAY IT BETTER SO- THANK YOU. BLOW THANK YOU MADAM TO. OF MINORS IS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT TURN OVER THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION THAT HAS COME BEFORE- THAT IS ONLY PERSPECTIVE GOING FORWARD. THERE WAS HOWEVER AN ELECTION. A REFERENDUM THAT- I CREATED A SCENARIO WHERE I IN- ONE COUNTY. THERE WOULD BE A RESTRICTION TO ONE TERM YOU COULD ONLY BE IN OFFICE FOR FOUR YEARS IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. AND IT IS. UGH MISTER MAYES POSITION ONE THAT I SHARE THAT FOR YEARS IS TOO SHORT A PERIOD OF TIME- AND IT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMEBODY CAN'T BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE BUT AFTER DOING A BAD JOB BYE BYE BY THE PEOPLE THAT COULD CERTAINLY HAPPEN BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR YEARS IT HAS- A SUB OPTIMAL TIME- TO BE AN OFFICE AND GET A JOB DONE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT I AGREE WITH- SO IF I UNDERSTAND THE BILL CORRECTLY. ANY ELECTION IN A COUNTY- THAT SEEKS TO SET TERM LIMITS COULD DO SO FREELY EXCEPT THAT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME- ONE COULD SERVE WOULD BE TWO FOUR YEAR TERMS AT THE FACT THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT I THINK THAT'S EMINENTLY REASONABLE- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL SUPPORT AND I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOST. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YES TO THAT QUESTION THAT SOME OF OUR BLUMA- ASKED REALLY. CLARIFY SOME OF MY- QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS I BUT- SO THE BILL NOW. STATES THAT THERE WAS A BALLOT- WHICH PASSED AS WELL. AND WHICH IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS A CONFIRMED- THAT THESE TERMS WOULD BE LIMITED TO THREE CORRECT AND THAT IT'S IN A SUPERVISOR PAY WAS TIED AT I BELIEVE 80% TO THE ANNUAL. BASE SALARY OF JUDGES IN THE SUPERIOR COURT AND SO WITH BOTH AND SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND- IF YOU CAN. WITH BOTH OF THEM PASSING BECAUSE MEASURE K. RECEIVED A HIGHER THRESHOLD- IS SO YOU KNOW I'M I'M JUST- IF YOU COULD HELP. ME UNDERSTAND BECAUSE BOTH OF THE PAST WHAT IS THE YOU KNOW THE- STATUS OF EACH. NO I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THE ONE I THINK THE LAW IS CLEAR AGAIN I'M NOT NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST VOTES WITH THOSE COMPETING- MEASURES OF WINDS- WHICH IS I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT THAT IS- THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO BE TO BE CLEARED FACT EVEN YEAH AND THE ANALYSIS- ACTS I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT AS WELL- WOULD I HAVE BROUGHT THIS BILL BEFORE- HAD ASSEMBLY NO COUNTY- AND NOT HAD TO THE ISSUE I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT- SO IS THIS BILL. A REACTION TO. THE COUNTY IT IS- BUT IF THIS ISN'T THIS BILL BEFORE YOU ISN'T ABOUT-ONE COUNTY AT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- AND I AM THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WHEN WE ESTABLISH- WHEN THE STATE ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- FIVE MEMBER BOARDS- WHAT WOULD BE THE PARAMETERS. FOR ALL OF THAT AS YOU SERVED- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY- SOME OF THEM ARE RIVAS YOU SURGEON AT EIGHT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL- AND FOR ME- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT PROSPECTIVELY GOING FORWARD. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE WAS A LOCAL A MEASURE- THAT THAT LOCAL MEASURE STILL CAN ESTABLISH TERM LIMITS BUT IT WOULD BE LIMITED TO TWO FOUR YEAR TERMS FOR A MAXIMUM OF EIGHT- INSTEAD OF- INSTEAD OF ANYTHING LESS THAN NOT. GONNA CUT IT KNOW WHY- APPRECIATE THAT WAS YES I DID SIR AT THE LOCAL- AS AS WAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW THESE LOCAL JOBS ARE CERTAINLY FULL TIME I WAS PAID PART TIME THAT'S WHY I HAD OTHER JOBS OR TO OTHER JOBS. WAS BUT IS VERY CHALLENGING YOU KNOW BUT CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW KNOWING WHAT THE CONVERSATION WAS I KNEW WHAT I WAS GET MYSELF INTO IS EXCITED TO BE ELECTED AND THEN NIGHT OF MY LIFE MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME SAID WHEN I GOT TO GO GO GET ANOTHER JOB SO THAT'S WHAT I DID. BUT NO- APPRECIATE THIS COME. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COM. MISTER MS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BUT WE HAVEN'T RIGHT WE HAVE. CAN'T CAN MEET AN AWFUL LOT- I DO THINK- THAT- AND WHEN IT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- THE CHAIR- AND OTHER COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WE WORK THROUGH- THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE TO BE ABLE. TO GET IT RIGHT- BUT- I DO- BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY- THAT FOR THE SAKE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT I'M OUT ARE COUNTY LEVEL THAT THIS BILL THIS BILL IS NECESSARY- AND SO- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS BEEN A YOU KNOW DIFFICULT CONVERSATION- BETTER BROUGHT A LOT TO THE- TO THE SURFACE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. WHERE YOU ARE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TIME TO BE ON THE BOARD. AND I CAN. I CAN TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL I WAS LOST FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS. I CAME EVEN HERE LOS FOR COUPLE YEARS SO. I THINK WE DO NEED MORE TIME AND I THINK THAT PORTION OF YOUR BILLS FAIR ENOUGH. AND I THINK THAT PORTION FITS. BOTH FEEL THE RIGHT BALANCE OF FOR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN OUR VOTERS BUT I WILL SAY I WILL- SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I WANTED TO MOVE ON AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS LEFT. A PARTICULARLY THAT WE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'M FROM I DON'T THINK ARE SUITED TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE ELECTIONS QUESTIONS. AND I SUPPORT- MISTER PROMISES. CONCERNS BUT I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY SO WE CAN GET MOVED ON.  YOU HAVE A- THOROUGH CONVERSATION WITH ELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL HAPPY SO THANK YOU. OKAY THE MOST TO DO. ELECTIONS COME SECOND PLEASE THE ROLL AND YOUR CURLY HI. AGUIAR-CURRY I. I'VE LACKEY. BLUE BLOOM I. BOERNER HORVATH. RAMOS WELL MOST. TO ROBERT RIVER. ROBERT WILL PASS. MADAM MADAM CHAIR- THIS ONE I HOPE- IS- IS A LITTLE LIGHTER- ALTHOUGH I'M FACT I'VE GOT A WHOLE SCRIPT HERE AND I'M JUST NOT GONNA DO THE SCRIPT- I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME CONVERSATION HERE AS YOU REMEMBER- MADAM CHAIR- IT A BILL THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THIS CAME BEFORE- THIS COMMITTEE- TWO YEARS AGO- BECAUSE- I HAD BEEN DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT ALMOST 60% OF THE PEOPLE OF THE RATE PAYERS. WITHIN IDEOLOGICAL SERVICE TERRITORY OF IMPUTATION DISTRICT WERE DISENFRANCHISED- AND DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO- TO VOTE AND SO WE HAD A BILL- TWO YEARS AGO OF THAT WOULD HAVE OF- THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE BOARD OF THE IMPUTATION DISTRICTS- ELEVEN MEMBERS- AND SIX OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO PROVIDE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO- THE AS YOU REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- IT WAS A PRETTY CONTENTIOUS- AND THE REASON. FOR THAT- WAS- THE FOLKS AT THE IMPALER GEISHA DISTRICT HAD SOME VERY REAL CONCERNS ABOUT- ABOUT THE BILL- IN SPECIFIC THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR WATER RIGHTS AND THE IMPACT OF HAVING MORE THAN- YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ON THEIR BOARD COMING FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT THAT COULD THREATEN THEIR FUTURE WATER RIGHTS AND WE HEARD THEM TRIED TO WORK ON THAT WORK THROUGH THROUGH THAT- THIS BILL BEFORE YOU- IS ACTUALLY A WATERED DOWN VERSION- OF WHAT WE HAD BEFORE- THIS STILL PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION- IT WOULD INSTEAD OF. HAVING SIX MEMBERS I THAT WOULD BE ELECTED TO THE BOARD- IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR ONE PERSON- FROM THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY- AREA OF THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE TERRITORY TO BE ABLE TO SERVE- AS AN EX OFFICIO MEMBER OR NOT VOTE A NON VOTING MEMBER OF THAT BOARD AND THEN IT WOULD- WOULD HAVE AT THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY LASKO AND THEN IMPERIAL COUNTY LASKO. I DO A STUDY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST COME UP WITH. ARIGHT THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION- AND- AND MADAM CHAIR I ALSO IN HERE TO REPORT TO YOU- THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN- I MY OFFICE- AND IMPALER GEISHA DISTRICTS IS MUCH BETTER TODAY- THAN IT WAS I JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I THINK WE STILL DISAGREE. ON ON THIS POLICY BUT WE DO HAVE- LINES OF COMMUNICATION THAT ARE OPEN- THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THIS ISSUE- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE MOVE. THROUGH THROUGH THE PROCESS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY IN THE GALLERY SEE NONE- OPERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN TWENTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GET THEIR LINE NUMBER. AGAIN I KNOW THIS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND IT WILL GO TO A LINE OF. TWO SEVENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YES HELLO MADAM CHAIR THIS IS SCOTT WEDGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN IN STRONG STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WE REPRESENT THE NINETY W. REPRESENTS A MAJORITY OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ID. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS. WHO ARE UTILITY RATEPAYERS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTATION ON THE ID FOR. A VOICE FOR THOSE 60% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS NEED TO HAVE REPRESENTATION THIS IS A TENDENCY TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. WE HAVE HEARD AS THE WORK FORCE AND ID WE HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH MANY MANY MANY- CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER REPAIR COMPLAINTS WERE FOLKS DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT THEY CAN TURN TO FROM THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE COULDN'T URGE THE COMMITTEE MORE. ADAMANTLY MOVE THIS BILL LONG WE BELIEVE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES HAS DONE AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF STRIKING A VERY FAIR BALLOTS THEN WE'D ORGANIZE THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I'M LOOKING FOR A HENRY MARTINEZ AS WELL AS THE JULIA HALL.

SERVICE REVIEWS SHOULD WHAT CAPTURED AND ANALYZED INFORMATION ABOUT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND EFFICIENCIES AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER COORDINATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN PROVIDERS. THAT BEING THE CASE. THEN THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT IS CLEARLY NOT NECESSARY. AB TEN TWENTY ONE WOULD ADD NONVOTING MEMBERS. WHO THE ALREADY BORED WHO WILL SHARE ALL THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF BOTH WATER AND ENERGY MATTERS. IN ADDITION TO BEING AUTHORIZED TO PARTICIPATE IN CLOSED SESSION DISCUSSIONS. THIS RACE IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN TO THE DISTRICT AND SAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL POTENTIALLY CREATES SERIOUS CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO HAVE SERVICE REGION FOR NEARLY NINETY YEARS. AS A COMMITTEE MY RECALL IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR. IDEA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT'S SETTLE DISPUTES BETWEEN OUR AGENCIES OVER WATER AND ENERGY RIGHTS THROUGH A NINETY NINE YEAR COMPROMISED AGREEMENT. PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE BENEFIT OF THIS PART PARTNERSHIP HAS SPENT A CONTINUOUS DELIVERY A LITTLE COST PUBLIC POWER TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY. UNFORTUNATELY AB TEN TWENTY ONE NOW ATTEMPTS TO INJECT THE STATE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THESE TWO LOCAL AGENCIES. JUST TWELVE YEARS BEFORE THE AGREEMENT REACHES ITS FULL TERM AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE PEOPLE THAT THE CHILL OF. AN IMPERIAL VALLEY'S THROUGH THEIR LOCAL ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES DESIGNATED.

AND RETURN COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IS GRANTED JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS FROM THE COLORADO RIVER AND. 8% AS AN ENERGY PROCEEDS. THIS IS A LONGSTANDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO AGENTS AND THEIR CONTENT. AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ON BETTER AND MORE FORMALIZED CROP COOPERATION TODAY. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THREE NONVOTING MEMBERS OUTSIDE ID TERRITORY FIFTY ON THE BOARD. ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT FORMALLY VOTE THEY WOULD HAVE TO TWELVE A FULL BOARD MEMBER AND BE PRETTY CLOSE NEED DISCUSSION. IDEAS THE IRRIGATION DISTRICT THE NEW NONVOTING MEMBERS WHO PROPOSED PURPOSES TO REPRESENT ELECTRICAL CUSTOMERS WOULD BE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO WATER RIGHTS AND WATER CONCERNS. WHICH JEOPARDIZES THE LONGSTANDING COOPERATION AND POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIONS. FURTHER EIGHTY TEN TWENTY ONE CONSTITUTES A TRULY UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION AND THE OPERATION OF A LOCAL AGENCY. MOTHER TOLD INCREASE OUR PRESENTATION OF LAUDABLE ID ALREADY HAS HAS A MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH DIFFICULT TO CHEAT. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I IDEAS MAINTAINED AND ENERGY CONSUMERS ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHOSE ROLE IT IS TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FULL ID BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY MEMBERS WHAT KIND OF THOSE BEING FROM THE COACHELLA VALLEY REGION. AND NOMINATED BY THAT REGION. THE PEOPLE ABOUT AND VALLEY. HERE THEY'RE LIKE DIVERT.

THAT BE WONDERFUL- OF THE OPPOSITION- IS RIGHT ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY SAID WERE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND I AM ALSO A BIG BELIEVER IN THE IDEA OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE- THAT THIS YEAR I WISH THIS COULD BE SOLVED- ATTY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I WISH THAT THE STATE WOULDN'T HAVE TO. I TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS AT THE CHALLENGES AS WE HAVE OUR LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION SO- THAT I SERVE- COUNTY BY COUNTY- AND- AND WE HAVE RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT WANTS ONE THING FACT THEY DID A SERVICE REVIEW- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- THAT SAID. THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE RIGHT FOR THOSE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO- TO VOTE AND THEN OTHER THE IMPERIAL COUNTY LASKO WHO'S ADAMANTLY OPPOSED BECAUSE DOWN IMPERIAL COUNTY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GIVE UP ANY ANY POWER ANY POLITICAL POWER TO- THAT THAT THEY COUNTY IN FROM THE NORTH. AND SO THE GOAL IS IN FACT I THINK THE TERM IS BEEN UNTENABLE- WE ARE IN AN UNTENABLE POSITION- BECAUSE- IN PURELY IRRIGATION DISTRICT DOES FANTASTIC WORK IN FACT THEY KEEP THEIR RATES ARE VERY LOW- NOT JUST THEIR THEIR LOGICAL RATES BUT ALSO THEIR WATER OTHER WATER RATES AND THEY THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. OF A FIGHTING EFFORT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AT WHAT WHITES UNTENABLE IS THAT WE HAVE A 60% NOT 6% BUT 60% OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THEIR LOGICAL- A SERVICE TERRITORY THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHO WILL SERVE THEM. ON THEIR BOARD AND SO WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS I DON'T THINK THE BILL AS IT'S AS IT'S DRAFTED IS PERFECT- WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT AGAIN- MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR WORK. AND A LOOK FOR WORKING WITH WITH ALL THE YOU. TO RESPECT THEIR REQUEST AND I WILL.

COMPLEX ISSUE FOR BOTH THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN THOSE RESIDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IN FACT THIS IS THE THIRD BILL THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS- CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A REPORT TO GET MORE INFORMATION- GROUP. THAT A LONGER TERM RESOLUTION LIKE THINGS TO BE REACHED. I BELIEVE THE BILL PROVIDES A REASONABLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE AMENDMENTS I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE WORKED ON A VERY SIMILAR TYPE. PROJECT BEFORE.

WITH UPDATED FEDERAL RULES AB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAKES DECISIONS WITHIN THE FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES WHICH ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED LEGISLATION WHICH CODIFIED THE GOVERNMENT'S SHOT CLOCK. FOR BROADBAND PROJECTS IN THE SKATE CALIFORNIA'S.

THIS BILL SIMPLY UPDATES CALIFORNIA LAW TO REFLECT THE NEW FEDERAL TIMELINE. THEY WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED TO THE CHOCOLATES ARE CONSISTENT. WE BELIEVE THAT AB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE THE PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL BY ALLOWING CITIES TO USE WHATEVER PROCESS THEY BALK TO EVALUATE BROADBAND PERMITS. AND ALLOW THEM TO APPROVE OR DENY THE BROADBAND PERMIT. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY IS MAKE SURE THE CITY IS MAKE A DECISION WITHIN FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES WHICH ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT.

A CELL ANTENNA IS CURRENTLY AND SHOULD REMAIN A MUNICIPAL AFFAIR AS THAT TERM IS USED IN ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTION FIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THOUSANDS OF STUDIES SHOW THAT LOCKED LEGAL AMOUNTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION CAUSES HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS MANY OF THESE STUDIES WERE PROVIDED TO THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON SB SIX FORTY NINE. THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. THIRTY NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOUND CLEAR EVIDENCE OF CANCER FROM CELL PHONE RADIATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE INTERNATIONAL EMF SCIENTISTS APPEAL SAID THAT ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IS HAZARDOUS IT CAUSES LEARNING AND MEMORY DEFICITS AND STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. THERE WAS A SIMILAR RESOLUTION BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. SECTION TWO H. OF THIS BILL EXEMPTS FIRE DEPARTMENT FACILITIES WHY IS THAT MEMBERS WE NEED SOCIAL EQUITY. IF THE CELL ANTENNA RADIATION RADIATION IS NOT SAFE FOR FIREFIGHTERS WHY IS IT SAFE FOR THE REST OF US. YOU DO NOT NEED A STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHOT CLOCKS IN THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION HAS SET THEM CURRENTLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN AND DO REGULATE CELL ANTENNAS WHILE ALSO FACILITATING THEIR DEPLOYMENT. THAT DEPLOYMENT IS ALREADY HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY. WE RELY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT US.
