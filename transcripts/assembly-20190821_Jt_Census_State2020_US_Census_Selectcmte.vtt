KEY OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ON

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.421
THE GROUND WHAT WERE SEEN IS

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.057

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:51.607
COMMUNICATIONS AND MESSAGING

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.242
WHILE THE FIRST AND VERY QUICK

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.710
LESSON WAS THAT. THERE IS NO

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.612
SILVER BULLET MESSAGE THERE IS

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.748
NO ONE SINGLE UNIFIED MESSAGE

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:00.783
THAT IS GOING TO RALLY EVERYONE

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.852
IT'S NOT ABOUT MOTIVATION. PER

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:05.521
S AND WHAT ARE IS GOING TO BE

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.456
ESSENTIAL THAN IS BUILDING DEEP

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.792
MESSAGING THAT ONE FOCUSES ON

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.261
INSTILLING TRUST. IN PEOPLE

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.262
THAT PARTICIPATING IN THE

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.865
CENSUS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:16.932
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THEIR

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.135
COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.302
TO EMPHASIZING THE

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.505
CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT THE

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.706
RULE OF LAW PROTECTS THE

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.008
CONFIDENTIALITY. AND THIRD

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.344
DIRECTING PEOPLE TO WHERE IT IS

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:29.879
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.680
TO GET ASSISTANCE AND WHAT

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:32.948
WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS A HARD TO

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.550
COUNT A COMMUNITIES AND I WILL

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.318
SAY THAT. BEYOND MESSAGING

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.820
WE'RE GONNA NEED SUBSTANCE

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.388
BEYOND THAT MESSAGE AND I JUST

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.290
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK OF

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.325

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.611
OF THE FULL REPORT I'M JUST

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:11.246

THINGS FROM THE OVERALL FOLKS

GET FOCUS GROUP TESTING THAT I

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.151
THINK ARE GOING TO BE RELEVANT

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:17.152
IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA. SO

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.556
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS JUST THE

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.558
UNDERSTANDING THAT AWARENESS

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.193
ABOUT THE CENSUS IS GOING TO BE

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:29.131
EXTREMELY LOW BUT WITH BASIC

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.199
INFORMATION PARTICIPATION

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.133
BECOMES MORE LIKELY SO NOW TO

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.267
THE FOCUS GROUP CONDUCTED

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:33.535
ACROSS EVERY SINGLE G. ABOUT

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.804
GEOGRAPHY AND POPULATION IS

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.239
OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR THAT MOST

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.507
PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.742
SENSES IS ONE. NO IDEA WHEN THE

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:43.312
CENSUS IS TWO AND THREE MORE

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:45.180
IMPORTANTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.481
HOW THE CENSUS ULTIMATELY

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.317
AFFECT THEM IN THEIR FAMILY SO

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:49.151
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.419
EDUCATION IT IS GOING TO BE

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.588
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE GET

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:53.789
AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN TERMS OF

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:56.225
EDUCATING POPULATIONS ABOUT

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.793
WHAT THE SENTENCES IT'S TIME

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.728
LINE AND SO WE FULLY ANTICIPATE

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.129
THAT STATE IS GONNA BE PREPARED

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:03.498
TO PROVIDE. THAT INFORMATION.

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:04.833
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.501
GONNA BE CRITICAL BECAUSE JUST

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.303
THE BASELINE OF INFORMATION

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.205
GETS FOLKSINTERESTED

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.942
ULTIMATELY. AND FILLING IT OUT

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:14.509
WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE SECOND

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:20.282
POINT. DON'T TELL PEOPLE SIMPLY

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.416
THAT THE CENSUS IS IMPORTANT.

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:22.050
SHOW THEM HOW IT AFFECTS THEIR

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.352
DAILY LIVES WHAT I MEAN BY THIS

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.553
IS THAT WE I CAN'T UNDER

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.220
EMPHASIZE THE FACT OF THE-

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.855
EDUCATION. ABOUT THE SENSES

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.523
NEEDS TO BE TIED TO HOW THE

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.392
SENSES WHAT IMPACT PEOPLE ON A

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.761
DAILY BASIS. SO ONE EXAMPLE OF

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:34.463
THE MESSAGING THAT WE TESTED

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:36.665
WAS WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING A

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:37.666
SLOGAN LIKE EVERY PERSON

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:40.569
COUNTED OUT MEANS FIFTEEN

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:41.670
HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FOR YOUR

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:43.605
COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.640
MAKING THOSE TYPES OF

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:45.440
STATEMENTS FROM THE FOCUS GROUP

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.109
TESTING WAS KIND OF A FALSE

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.243
COMMITMENT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.344
PUTTING A FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:50.178
DOLLAR CHECK IN PEOPLE'S

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.648
POCKETS RIGHT. MOREOVER IF

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.982
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GRAN

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.851
NUMBERS LIKE CALIFORNIA STANDS

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:58.387
TO LOSE X. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.855
IF WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.023
SENSE OF DOUBT ALSO DOESN'T

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.158
WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:05.460
THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES LIVES

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.462
THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:08.964
STAKE DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.232
IN INDIVIDUALS WHAT.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:12.401
INDIVIDUALS LIVES ALTERNATIVELY

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.202
WHAT WE FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:17.072
WAS MESSAGING THAT REALLY

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:17.873
RELATED TO FOCUS ON A LOCAL

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.341
LEVEL SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT THE

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:23.712
CENSUS BECAUSE IT'LL HELP

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:24.279
FREEPORT ELEMENTARY KEEP ITS

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:29.184
HEAD START PROGRAM. BE SPECIFIC

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.786
AND BE LOCAL ABOUT OUR APPROACH

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:31.653
FROM A MESSAGING STANDPOINT I'M

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.220
GONNA SKIP AHEAD IN TERMS OF

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:33.355
OUR OTHER FINDINGS AND REALLY

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:33.855
LAND ON SOME OF THE KEY

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.058
COMPONENTS I WOULD REITERATE.

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.392
MARINES POINT ABOUT THE

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.061
EMPHASIS OF THERE'S NOT GOING

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:40.696
TO BE A SINGLE TAGLINE OR HASH

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.732
TAG I WISH WE COULD THROW A

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:44.733
HASHTAG ON AND MAKE EVERYTHING

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.235
WONDERFUL AGAIN. BUT THE

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:48.637
REALITY IS THAT THE CHALLENGES

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:49.771
THAT EXISTS FROM SENSES

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.640
STANDPOINT A REALLY GOING TO

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.542
COME DOWN TO THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:54.843

ULTIMATELY THE FOLKS ON THE

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:03.218
GROUND AND HOW THEY TIE BACK

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:06.888
TOGETHER. THROWING TAGLINES OR

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:09.324
TRANSLATING MESSAGES IN MALTA

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.692
THE SAME MESSAGE IN MULTIPLE

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.408
BEEN LOCALIZED THROUGH A SET OF

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.510
WHAT WE CALL REGIONAL TABLES

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.245
WHICH MEET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:32.780
WHICH I THINK CURRENTLY RIGHT

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:35.149
NOW ARE MAXING OUT ABOUT FOUR

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.150
HUNDRED TOTAL ORGANIZATIONS

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:38.186
PARTICIPATING. AND WHAT THEY DO

01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:39.520
THERE'S THROUGH AN AGENDA THEY

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.623
LINK UP THE AS SOON TO FIRST

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.890
ALL SHARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:43.725
THE DIFFERENT CORNERS OF THE

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.727
COUNTY. AND THEY BREAK AWAY AND

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.695
THEY ALL PLANNED LOCALLY AND

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.063
SORT OF IDENTIFY WHO'S DOING

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.732
WHAT WHO'S GOT WHAT RESOURCES

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:52.934
AND WHAT ARE WE DOING. OP THAT

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:55.203
THAT'S JUST BEEN HAPPENING FOR

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.038
SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND WHAT AND

01:27:57.105 --> 01:28:00.108
THAT. ALSO BE GRANTS AND THE

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:01.175
RESOURCES THAT WE GAVE I'VE

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:03.911
GIVEN US A VIEW OF. EACH

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:04.946
ORGANIZATION THAT APPLIED

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.015
SHARED WHAT REGION'S THEY HAVE

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:08.383
STRENGTH IN AND WHERE THEY WILL

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:11.853
BE DOING WORK AND THAT'S

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:12.620
ALLOWED US TO START TO SEE WHO

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:13.554
ARE IN THE JOBS THAT WE MAKE

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.190
SURE CONNECTING. AND TALKING

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:16.824
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:22.397
WORK WORK LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:22.997
OF AN EXAMPLE A PRACTICAL WAY

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:29.604
AND. IS IT. VERY PLAIN TERMS OF

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:30.204
REACHING THE HARD TO COUNT IS

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:31.339
GONNA BE THAT. THERE'S NOT ONE

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:33.474
SINGLE MEDIUM SOCIAL MEDIA IS

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:34.075
CRITICAL AND WE CAN'T REMEMBER

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.910
THAT WHILE WE'RE ALL CITING.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.146
THE FACT THAT THIS IS A DIGITAL

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:38.613
FIRST SENT TO THAT THE

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.581
CHALLENGE. FOR MANY IMMIGRANT

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.215
COMMUNITIES IT COULD BE TURNED

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:41.783
INTO AN ASSET BECAUSE THEY

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.417
SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOWNLOADING

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.786
VIDEO ON MOBILES AND SO AS LONG

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.888
AS THIS APP. FOR THE FORM IS

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.790
MOBILE FRIENDLY I THINK IT

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:50.191
COULD BE AN ASSET AND THE KEY

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.859
THING IS TO REMEMBER THAT. ARE

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:53.294
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE MIXED

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:56.230
STATUS AND SO WE'RE NOT JUST

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:57.231
TALKING TO THE PARENT WERE

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:59.400
TALKING TO THEIR NIECES AND

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.435
NEPHEWS TO THE KIDS THAT

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:02.270
ACTUALLY NAVIGATE. A LOT OF

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:03.471
THESE ISSUES FOR THEM AND WILL

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.206
NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.674
GEARING THE IMAGES AND THINGS

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.109
THAT THEY SEATED MAKE THIS BE A

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.712
FAMILY PEACE THOSE ARE JUST

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:11.279
SOME VERY. IMMEDIATE THINGS

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:15.583
THAT WERE SEEN. ARE JUST REALLY

01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:16.217
QUICKLY TWO THOUGHTS ON THAT I

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:16.751
THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:19.220
LEARNED FROM. THE WORK THAT WE

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.189
DID AROUND ENROLLMENT DURING

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:22.523
THE ACA WAS TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.258
COORDINATE OUR P. MEDIA

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:26.127
STRATEGY WITH IN REAL LIFE

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.528
ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS THAT

01:29:27.595 --> 01:29:29.397
ULTIMATELY. ARE PAID MEDIA

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.832
DOLLARS NEED TO BE DRIVING

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.667
PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ON THE

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.903
GROUND. AND TO HELP THE HARDEST

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:38.005
PART IS. TOCOUNT POPULATIONS

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:40.074
GET. THE TANGIBLE SUPPORT TO

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.375
FILL OUT THE CENSUS FORM AND SO

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:42.877
A LOT OF FOLKS TALK ABOUT. THE

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.345
DIGITAL DIVIDE I THINK ACT

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.580
ACTUALLY DIGITAL LITERACY

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:48.282
COMPONENT. AND SO GETTING FOLKS

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:49.417
TO THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:50.818
IS CRITICAL THE OTHER THING WE

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:51.886
LEARNED FROM THE FOCUS GROUP

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.187
TESTING IS THAT WE'RE PROBABLY

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:55.323
GONNA BE MORE EFFECTIVE TALK

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.124
ABOUT THE SENSES BY NOT TALKING

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:57.358
ABOUT THE SENTENCE. TALK ABOUT

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:58.826
THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE CARE THE

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.261
MOST THAT IMPACT THEM THE MOST

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.663
SO. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.231
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE THINK

01:30:03.297 --> 01:30:04.298
IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL IS

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.300
WORKING WITH. CLINICS TO MAKE

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:07.435
SURE THAT THEY ARE HIGHLIGHTING

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.737
THE SENSES BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:10.571
FOR THE HARDEST ACCOUNT

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:12.106
POPULATIONS THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.342
THE ENTRY POINT. TO TALK ABOUT

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.743
THE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT IMPACT

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.112
THEM AND THEN ULTIMATELY

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:23.017
HOLDING IN. A MESSAGE. FLANK

TOP OF THAT. YEAH I MEAN WE-

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:30.792
PART OF PART OF WHAT WE SEEK TO

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:32.193
DO IS ALSO USING OUR PROMOTE A

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.394
MODEL THAT WE ALREADY USE AND

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:34.295
TERMS OF TRUST AND MESSENGERS

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:35.663

AND THAT'S HARD TO SAY IF ONLY

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:41.095
BECAUSE SOMETIMES OUR FOLKS

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.965
DON'T SELF IDENTIFY AS BEING

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:44.565

IN TERMS OF INTER COUNTY WE'RE

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.610
LOOKING AT PROBABLY

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:57.211
200-002-5000 SANTA BARBARA

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.946
COUNTY IS A LITTLE BIGGER

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:01.215
TWENTY NINE TO LIKE THIRTY SOME

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:01.782
THOUSAND AND IT JUST REALLY

01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:03.284
DEPENDS ON THE GROUP SO THE

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:04.986
MYSTICAL GROUPS ARE MORE

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.120
MONOLINGUAL VERSES THAT

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.688
POLITICAL MORE BILINGUAL IN THE

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.123
OF A US THE SIZEABLE AMOUNT IS

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.692
UP WITH THAT GO AND SOUTH LA.

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.727
FOR EXAMPLE SO REALLY JUST

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.562
DEPENDS ON THE GROUP AND OTHERS

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:15.329
PUT IT PENSIONS AND COACHELLA

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:23.070
VALLEY THEY LOOK. MORE

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:23.638
BILINGUAL SO IT REALLY JUST

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:28.776
DEPENDS. OKAY. SOUNDS LIKE A

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:29.377
LAWYER IT DEPENDS BUT IN ANY

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.112
EVENT. IS IT LIKE A HUNDRED

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:31.979
THOUSAND YOU THINK MONOLINGUAL

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:32.580
INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:33.214
SOMETHING I'M JUST I'M REALLY.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.916
LOOKING FOR A ROUGH ORDER OF

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:35.549
MAGNITUDE YEAH YOU KNOW I THAT

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:36.584
I DON'T KNOW. THE THERE'S NOT A

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:37.418
LOT OF STUDIES ON IT WE WERE

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.619
PART OF A STUDY THIS YEAR ON

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.921
STUDYING THE LANGUAGES AND SO

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:40.521
THOSE RESULTS ARE JUST COMING

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:43.925
OUT. BUT AGAIN IT IT DEPENDS

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:44.425
BECAUSE EITHER BILINGUAL

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:45.893
SOMETIMES EVEN TRACK WITH THE

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.460
U. THE TRILINGUAL WHICH IS

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:47.828
GREAT BUT MONOLINGUAL IT'S HARD

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.330
TO SAY. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.932
WAVE TO AS WELL WHAT WE SAW IN

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:55.569
THE NINETIES. HIGHER OF.

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:56.170
PERCENTAGES OF MIT MONOLINGUAL

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:59.040
INDIGENT SPEAKERS. AND THEN

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:00.107
QUESTIONS TRYING. IS IT I TAKE

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:00.675
YOUR POINT ABOUT THE SORT OF

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.676
MICRO MESSAGING THAT THAT

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:02.843
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.912
IT FOR ME IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:05.546
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE POINTS

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.648
YOU WERE MAKING. WHICH WOULD

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:09.850
MILITATE AGAINST SORT OF DOING

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:14.722
A BRANDING KIND OF COKE KIND OF.

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:15.356
THAT'S THE GOOD THE BEVERAGE OF

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:18.492
TALK ABOUT. THE OF THE SORT OF

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.995
SORT OF A CAMPAIGN SO IT WOULD

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.697
SEEM THAT BROADCAST TV IT WOULD

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:25.232
NOT BE VERY USEFUL OR BROADCAST

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.567
RADIO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IS

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:29.103
THAT ACCURATE I WOULD SAY IT'S

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.905
YES AND I THINK YOU ABSOLUTELY

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.239
NEED BOTH IN TERMS OF CREATING

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.975
THE SOUTH SURROUND SOUND TO DO

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.309
THE ONE A ONE EDUCATION ABOUT

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:37.278
THE CENSUS. BUT TO GET TO THE

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.512
HEART IS THE HARDEST REACH

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.914
POPULATIONS I THINK YOU'RE

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:41.949

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:43.084
LANGUAGE DIRECTED AT THOSE

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.953

THE TARGETED IN NARAL APPROACH

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.736

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:04.505
YOU LOOK AT THE CASE WE COVER

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.407

PARTICULARLY PURSUE FOR THOSE

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:23.984

STORY NO IN THE SCHOOL

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:09.730
DISTRICTS. WE HAD THE SAME

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:10.564
ISSUE WHERE PARENTS THEN STAN

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:12.733
A. B. D. HAVE ON SO WHAT WE

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.135
ADVOCATED FOR TEACHERS IF THEY

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.070
HAD A MYSTICAL SPEAKING PARENT.

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:18.772
OF GREEN IS GOOD YELLOW THEY

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:19.573
NEED WORK IN RED IS YOU KNOW

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.144
NOT GREAT. YOU KNOW AND THE

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.078
OTHER THING IN THE SPACES THAT

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.913
WE'VE BEEN AND AS MY CALL WITH

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.248
REGARDS TO THE SENSES MAKING

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.550
SURE THAT WHATEVER IS DEVELOPED

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:32.119
IS DEVELOPED. AT A SECOND GRADE

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:34.355
LEVEL OR LOWER BECAUSE THAT YOU

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.457
CAN GET REALLY LOST IN THE NEW

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:37.858
ONES AS OF THAT AND SO MAKE

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.894
SURE THAT IT SENSIBLE. IN TERMS

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.295
OF LEVEL IF YOU KNOW IF THE

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:41.862
GATE WAS IN SPANISH THAT IS

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:49.603
JUST NOT. POSSIBLE GRADE LEVEL

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.237
FOR FROM TO REACH REGARDLESS OF

01:36:50.304 --> 01:37:02.383
THE LANGUAGE. WE HAVE OVER TWO

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:03.117
HUNDRED LANGUAGES SPOKEN AND

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.618
YOU START TO ADD THAT UP.

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:06.287
FACING SOME VERY SIMILAR

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.955
CHALLENGES CHARACTER BASED

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:10.524
LANGUAGES AND YOU KNOW. YOU

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:11.025
KNOW SOUNDS GREAT TYPE

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.594
LANGUAGES AND SO. IF WE'RE

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.795
LOOKING AT A NUMBER IN LA

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:15.996
COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.131
PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:19.066
OUT OF EVERY FOUR PEOPLE. IN LA

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.434
COUNTY ARE IN THE HOUSEHOLD

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:21.735
THAT SPEAKS A LANGUAGE. OTHER

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:24.071
THAN ENGLISH. AND SO IT'S A

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:25.673
PRETTY LARGE NUMBER OF

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:28.108
INDIVIDUALS. AND I THINK WHEN

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.778
IT GOES WHEN IT GETS TOWARDS.

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:33.080
HOW WE DELIVER INFORMATION HOW

01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:36.217
WE DO THAT. I THINK IT'S NOT. I

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:37.351
THINK PROBABLY WHATWE'RE

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:39.153
ADVOCATING FOR IS THAT IF YOU

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.255
HAVE A TOTAL BUCKET OF DOLLARS.

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:42.890
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.559
HARDEST TO REALLY MOVE. HAVE

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:46.393
ALL THESE CHALLENGES ARE VERY

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.929
BIG LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE. AND

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.264
VERY STRONGLY CONNECT TO MEDIA

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.199
THAT REFLECTS OUR CULTURE. WE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.067
SHOULD MAKE THE HEAVIEST

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:55.002
INVESTMENT THERE. AND THEN TRY

01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:57.905
TO PROVIDE THE OVER ARCHING.

01:37:57.972 --> 01:37:58.405
YOU KNOW GENERAL MARKET

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.441
INVESTMENT. THERE BUT-

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:01.942
TRADITIONALLY WE'VE DONE THE

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.444
OPPOSITE WE'VE INVESTED 10% OF

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.446
THE BUDGET. IN THE HARDEST TO

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:07.114
REACH PEOPLE. AND NINETY

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:09.750
PERCENT. ON THE SNAZZY REALLY

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.051
COOL LOOKING THING. TO

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:15.956
NORMALIZE THE CENSUS. SO I'M I

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:16.590
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A CULTURAL

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:22.563
ASPECT. ENTER PAN TO YOUR POINT

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.031
IT'S ABOUT A CULTURAL ASPECT

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:25.399
AND MAKING SURE IT'S EMBEDDED

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:27.034
AND THINGS. AND THEN ANOTHER

01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:29.236
QUESTION. AND PRY ALSO ASK IF

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:31.872
THE FOLLOWING PANEL BUT- SO YOU

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:32.573
KNOW THE CENSUS IS ACTUALLY

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.440
FEDERAL ACTIVITY SO WE'RE

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.575
PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY AND THE

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:35.309
STATE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:36.210
IMPORTANT IT IS SO. THE FEDS

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:37.411
ARE GOING TO DO THEIR OWN.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:40.247
MEDIA PLAN OF SOME SORT. WE

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:41.048
WON'T HAVE VERY MUCH SAY IN

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:43.250
THAT I THINK SO WE'RE GONNA

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.552
HAVE THAT. FLOATING OVER. SO IN

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.354
ADDITION TO POTENTIAL YOU KNOW

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.188
MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.056
OTHER TYPES OF MESSAGING WE

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.758
HAVE DURING PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGNS

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:51.992
OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES GOING

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.927
ON THAT MAY. BE PEOPLE MORE OR

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:56.430
LESS WILLING TO OPEN THE DOOR

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:59.233
TO A STRANGER. WE WILL ALSO

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.535
HAVE A FEDERAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:07.074
HOW DO YOU SEE THE STATE.

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.942
TAILORING ITS CAMPAIGN IN

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:09.443
RELATION TO THE FEDERAL

01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.812
CAMPAIGN AND THEN OF COURSE WE

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:12.346
TALKED ABOUT THE INTERFACE

01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:15.015
BETWEEN THE STATE AND DIFFERENT

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:16.450
COMMUNITIES BUT THEN WE ALSO OF

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:19.253
THIS FEDERAL CAMPAIGN TO I MEAN.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.087
THAT'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE

01:39:20.154 --> 01:39:21.588
WHETHER WE COORDINATE WITH THAT

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:22.790
OR NOT WHETHER WE'RE IN SYNC

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:23.791
WITH THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW WE

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:24.892
COULD CREATE CONFUSION OF OR

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:26.226
NOT. SO DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:28.562
ABOUT FOR ON THE GROUND AND

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:29.630
MAYBE THE PEOPLE JUST IGNORE IT

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.298
BECAUSE IT'S TOO. DISCONNECTED

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.833
FROM THEM I DON'T KNOW SO I'D

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.001
END UP WITH YOU ANY THOUGHTS TO

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.669
YOUR SURVEYS OUR FOCUS GROUPS

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.404
OR SO FORTH WE'RE GONNA GET

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:39.606
MESSAGING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:42.743
GOVERNMENT'S. ON CENSUS. WHERE

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:43.477
SHOULD THE STATE POSITION

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:44.044
ITSELF RELATION TO THAT FROM

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:47.281
YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YEAH I THINK

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:49.116
IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EARLY

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:50.417
CONTENT THAT'S COME OUT FROM

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:52.486
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT FEELS

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.588
PRETTY AGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:55.155
THEIR APPROACH TO THE CENSUS

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:57.925
WRITING HAT. FOR THE MOST PART

01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.326
THE CONTENT COMING FROM TO THE

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:00.761
CENSUS BUREAU HAS NOT BEEN

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.629
NEGATIVE RIGHT OR HAD I NOT

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:03.864
BEEN FILLED WITH ITS

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.532

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.369
WANT. AND I WILL BE VERY CLEAR

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:10.704
BECAUSE YEAH I WAS WATCHING I

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:11.338
HAVEN'T I AM NOT ACCUSING VERY

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:13.774
WAS. OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.042
OF DOING THAT THERE ARE OTHER

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.809
ACTORS THAT A VERY INVOLVED

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.244
THAT SO I HAVE NO GOOD AND

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.846
THAT'S NOT MY CONCERN BUT THE

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.547
US CENSUS WILL DECIDE ON A

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:21.782
MEDIA STRATEGY. THEY'LL PLAY A

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.017
MEDIA STRATEGY THAT'S BOTH AN

01:40:24.084 --> 01:40:25.452
OPPORTUNITY AND POTENTIALLY

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.754
CHALLENGE THE PENNY OF WHAT

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.555
STRATEGY THEY PICKING WHETHER

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.190
THAT SEEMS RESONATOR NOT BUT IT

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:32.059
WILL BE OUT THERE. WRITING BUT

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.227
NOT THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:33.861
IN ALL THE CENSUSES PART RIGHT

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:36.497
YEAH I THINK I WOULD. I WOULD

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:38.132
TAKE THE LANDS OF LOOKING AT IT

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:39.967
IN THE CONTEXT OF I DON'T THINK

01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:41.168
FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:43.237
DIFFERENTIATE RIGHT WHERE THE

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.072
MESSAGE IS COMING FROM RIGHT.

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:46.507
WHAT IS GOING TO RESONATE WITH

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:48.409
FOLKS IS HOW MUCH THEY TRUST

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:49.676
THE PERSON TELLING THEM ONE AND

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:53.180
THEN TO. I THINK IT GOES BACK

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:54.047
TO THE POINT ABOUT LIKE IT'S

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:55.315
NOT ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:56.683
MESSENGER SO I THINK THE

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:58.185
STATE'S INVESTMENT NEEDS TO BE

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:00.487
REALLY TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:08.429
MESSENGERS TO BE BEAT REALLY.

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:09.062
SPEARHEADING THE EFFORT. ON THE

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:13.534
COMMUNICATIONS AND BECAUSE I.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.902
LIKE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:15.536
TO TELL UNTIL THE END OF THE AD

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:16.370

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.205
WHAT LOGO YOU THROUGH ON THERE

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:18.972
LIKE IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:19.973
FOLKS TO DIFFERENT. I THINK.

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:21.041
UNDERSTANDING CORRECT ME ANYONE

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:21.642
FROM WRONG BUT I THINK IT THE

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:22.276
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TRYING TO

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:16.723
THOUSAND THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:19.259
MISTRUST OF THE OF THE

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.860
GOVERNMENT AT THEIR TENDS TO BE

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:22.295
OUR DURING THE COURSE OF

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:25.999
HISTORY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:28.101
TEN WE HAD THE PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:31.304
WHO WAS WIDELY SUPPORTED IN

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:35.141
CALIFORNIA BY BOB. FOLKS ACROSS

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.042
THE ACROSS THE POLITICAL A

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:39.245
GEOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM YET THERE

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:40.980
WAS STILL A LOT OF MISTRUST

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:43.650
WHEN IT CAME TO THE SENSES IN

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:44.584
TWO THOUSAND TEN DESPITE THE

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:45.985
GREAT WORK THAT THE US AND THE

01:53:46.052 --> 01:53:48.121
CENSUS CAMPAIGN DID IN THE

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:50.323
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BOB THAT

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:52.225
WAS THE FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.092
DIDN'T GROW IN TERMS OF OUR

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.994
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. THAT

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:57.263
WAS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN BUT

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:58.531
YET WE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:02.569
THE STATE DID IN DOING A UP THE

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:04.871
BEST JOB I COULD TO MAKE SURE

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:05.738
THAT EVERYBODY WAS ADEQUATELY

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:07.540
COUNTED IN THE CENSUS THE

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:09.943
DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW IS THAT

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:11.344
THE POLITICAL STAKES ARE MUCH

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:12.979
HIGHER AND NOT TO TURN THIS

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.280
INTO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:16.983
BECAUSE IT'S NOT. BUT CERTAINLY

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.018
ONE CAN'T SIMPLY JUST READ

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:21.221
BETWEEN THE TEAMS WE HAVE TO

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:22.555
TAKE THIS ON THIS ISSUE ON HEAD

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:26.392
ON AND THE ISSUE IS THAT THE

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:27.627
LEVELS OF FEAR PARTIAL

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:29.662
HEIGHTENED. IN THE VERY IS

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:31.297
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THAT

01:54:31.364 --> 01:54:33.299
ARE TYPICALLY UNDERCOUNTED BUT

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:35.568
ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUTSIDE

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:37.637
OF THE UNDERCOUNT CATEGORY ARE

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:39.572
JUST YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:41.007
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.275
WHETHER IT'S A LATINO IMMIGRANT

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:44.310
COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S THE ARAB

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:47.380
AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ASIAN

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:48.381
AMERICAN COMMUNITY THERE'S

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:51.751
VARIOUS COMMUNITIES INSIDE A

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:56.756
CALIFORNIA FOLKS. HAVE

01:54:56.823 --> 01:55:01.894
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF FEAR.

01:55:01.961 --> 01:55:02.528
WHERE IT RELATES TO THE FEDERAL

01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:07.300
GOVERNMENT. SO. ALL OF A

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:09.302
SENATOR OUR IN OUR LOVE SAYING

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:09.836
THIS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT

01:55:09.902 --> 01:55:11.738
SENATOR RUSSELL SO RIGHTLY SAID

01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:13.339
IN HER COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:13.906
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHIFT FROM

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:14.474
THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.743
AND HOW YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT AS

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:18.711
AN OPPORTUNITY IN TODAY'S DAY

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:21.414
AND AGE IS THAT WHILE THERE IS

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.916
A LACK OF TRUST FOR THE FEDERAL

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:24.784
GOVERNMENT BUT IT GOES MUCH

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:26.653
DEEPER THAN THAT IT'S A LOT OF

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:27.487
FEAR TOWARDS THE FEDERAL

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:29.522
GOVERNMENT ON THE PART OF MANY

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:31.157
OF THE VULNERABLE COMMUTERS IN

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.559
CALIFORNIA THERE SEEMS TO BE A

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:36.129
GROWING AMOUNT. OF SUPPORT FOR

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:42.135
THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:44.304
FOR BOB THE POLITICAL.

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.039
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES INSIDE OF

01:55:46.105 --> 01:55:46.873
THE STATE OF FOR MANY REASONS

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.074
SOME WHICH ARE ARE VERY OBVIOUS

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:49.909
TO PEOPLE. SO WHAT DOES THAT DO

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:51.878
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR US AS

01:55:51.944 --> 01:55:55.048
WE COME INTO INTO THIS CAMPAIGN.

01:55:55.114 --> 01:55:55.481
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.617
CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY.

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:59.118
ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:01.988
HAVE A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN THAT

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:04.057
ULTIMATELY BRANDS ITSELF BUT

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.124
THE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN VERSES

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:07.226
DOING THE MICRO OF MESSAGING

01:56:07.293 --> 01:56:09.662

THE PEOPLE TRUST. AND I WOULD

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:14.167
SAY TO YOU THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:56:14.233 --> 01:56:16.769
BOTH OF THOSE ONE DOESN'T.

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:19.706
DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT THE OTHER.

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:20.306
ALL THE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:22.175
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.476

LOOKING AT DOING HERE. THE

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:28.548
QUESTION THAT SENATOR LAWCENTER

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:30.316
USED TO BE SENATOR PADILLA BUT

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:33.886

HOW WE ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:40.727
THIS INFORMATION AND

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.829
MISINFORMATION. YOU KNOW THAT

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.731
COULD PRESENT ITSELF AS TEN

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:48.234
MAYBE FIFTEEN MAYBE 20% OF THE

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:49.302
PROBLEM WE'RE PREPARED AND HAVE

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:52.271
A STRATEGY. ALL THAT IS BEING

01:56:52.338 --> 01:56:53.706
DEVELOPED AS WE SPEAK AND

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:55.675
COULDN'T. IN EFFECT

THE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. THAT

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.253
I THINK THAT WE'RE VERY WELL

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:09.055
PREPARED FOR US TO DEAL WITH

01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:09.756
MISINFORMATION AND

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:13.059
DISINFORMATION IN A WAY IN

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:15.395
WHICH HELPS US UP TOWNER OF

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:17.430
THOSE MESSAGES BOB WHETHER IT'S

COUNTER ALL THAT THERE'S A

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:33.179
WHOLE STRATEGY TO DO THAT NOW

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.347
WE DON'T WANT THAT TO TAKE A

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:35.248
100% OF THE EFFORT BECAUSE YOU

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:35.782

FOR ME TODAY IT IS NIMBLE.

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:22.054
BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO CHANGE

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:23.589
IN REAL TIME PARTICULARLY WHEN

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.539
DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU MIGHT

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:42.875
THINK OF A TRADITIONAL MEDIA

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.411
CAMPAIGN AND WE WANT YOU TO

02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:46.011

PLAN. TO CLARIFY MISINFORMATION

02:04:54.253 --> 02:04:56.655
IS USUALLY DEFINED AS PERHAPS

02:04:56.722 --> 02:04:58.190
SOMETHING THAT IS RE TWEETED

02:04:58.257 --> 02:04:59.825
INADVERTENTLY BY SOMEBODY WHO

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:01.427
DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT

02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:02.761
THEIR SPREADING. SOMETHING

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:05.497
THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASED. THIS

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:06.031
INFORMATION COMES FROM BAD

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:09.802
ACTORS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:12.037
ATTENTION LATELY UNFORTUNATELY

02:05:12.104 --> 02:05:13.739
ON THE DEEP AND DARK WEB AND WE

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:16.075

INFRASTRUCTURE BEING DEVELOPED

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:32.892
RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT A LOT OF

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.160

02:05:35.227 --> 02:05:38.564
THAT. I AGREE IT IS THE SAD

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:41.433
REALITY AND WE HOPE TO COME AT

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.067

TALK ABOUT. DOLLARS BUT WE

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.622
ENVISION THAT EVERY COMMUNITY

ROB ORAL AND URBAN ALIKE WILL

02:16:04.923 --> 02:16:06.791

PLACE OF WORSHIP SO IT THAT IS

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:18.436
OBVIOUSLY A VERY VERY

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:21.106
IMPORTANT. DAY AND PERIOD FOR

02:16:21.172 --> 02:16:23.041
THAT REAL TIME RESPONSE BUT

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:24.543
RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:25.477
THE LANDSCAPE AND TRYING TO

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:26.878
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO THAT

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:27.946
THEIR INFORMED AND WISE RIGHT

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:29.648

ABOUT. I MEAN JUST ROUGHLY LIKE

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:36.721
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A QUARTER

02:16:36.788 --> 02:16:39.424
AND THREE QUARTERS OF THE HALF

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:40.659
AND HALF TWO THIRDS ONE THIRD

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:42.527
IRATE JUST GET IT. SO YEAH SO I

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:45.096
PART OF OUR PLAN FOR THIS FALL

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.933
IS TO REALLY BREAK DOWN SOME OF

02:16:47.999 --> 02:16:48.667
THE BARRIERS FEAR HAS BEEN A

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:51.202
WORK FOR HEARING A LICENSE AND

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:53.838
SO. THIS ISN'T A NORMAL CALMS

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.407
COMMUNICATION EVEN BEHAVIOR

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:57.142
CHANGE CAMPAIGN THIS IS THAT WE

02:16:57.208 --> 02:16:58.610
GOT TO GET UP AND GOING AND GET

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:01.046
PEOPLE COMFORTABLE. AND WE WANT

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.948
TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE DO LAUNCH

02:17:03.014 --> 02:17:08.453
A LARGER. CAMPAIGN WE'VE

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:13.592
STARTED THE SOFT CONVERSATION.

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:15.694
SOMETIMES THAT IS MORE

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.128
EXPENSIVE. RIGHT THEN DOING THE

02:17:17.195 --> 02:17:18.663
AIR GAME. THE SO IN THEIR NESTS

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:19.664
AND WHY WE PLAN THOSE OUT. I

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:20.665
WOULD IT WOULD BE REMISS FOR US

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:21.199
TO TELL YOU A PERCENTAGE

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.033

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:23.101
COSTS WHEN YOU DO THOSE MORE IN

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:24.135
COMMUNITY VERY FOCUSED APPROACH

02:17:24.202 --> 02:17:26.705
AS- IT CAN BE MORE EXPENSIVE

02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:27.606
THAN DOING A BIGGER BROADER.

02:17:27.672 --> 02:17:31.076
BLAST YEAH SO. WE WILL HAVE

02:17:31.142 --> 02:17:33.478

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:34.713
THAT WILL ROLL OUT FOR THE

02:17:34.779 --> 02:17:37.282
FALL. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE WE

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.050

02:26:54.405 --> 02:26:56.474
BRANDT RIGHT HANDED TO THEM.

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:57.575
AND WERE WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT

02:26:57.642 --> 02:26:58.976
BUT IT'S OUR CHALLENGE IN OUR

02:26:59.043 --> 02:27:00.778
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A BRAND.

02:27:00.845 --> 02:27:03.848
THAT IS A STATE WIDE BRAND BUT

02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:06.083
ALSO ADAPTABLE AND NOT

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:08.186
DISRUPTIVE TO THE BRANDS THAT

02:27:08.252 --> 02:27:09.086
HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED YOU

02:27:09.153 --> 02:27:10.188
MENTIONED SEEING IN YOUR OWN

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:12.356
DISTRICT. SO THAT'S UNDER WAY

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:15.259
AS WE SPEAK AND WERE TALKING

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:16.894
WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND

02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:17.562
ABOUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE

02:27:17.628 --> 02:27:20.531
AND HOW IT COULD BE ADAPTABLE.

02:27:20.598 --> 02:27:21.132
YOU KNOW CERTAIN COLORS DON'T

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:22.166
MATCH OTHER COLORS AND WE WANT

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:24.535
TO. GIVE THEM OPTIONS SO THAT

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:25.836
WE'RE NOT DISRUPTING OR

02:27:25.903 --> 02:27:27.972
MODIFYING TO BORROW YOUR WORD.

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:30.208
OF GOOD BROWN'S THAT ARE

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:32.243
ALREADY OUT THERE AND- GREAT. I

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:33.477
DON'T SAID THAT BY THE WAY I

02:27:33.544 --> 02:27:34.979
THINK I ALSO. I DO THINK THAT

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:37.982
GIVING. THE THERE IS A NEED.

02:27:38.049 --> 02:27:40.117
AND WILL BE A NEED TO HAVE.

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:42.420
OVERARCHING THEMES THAT

02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:43.788
ULTIMATELY THE STATE CAN RALLY

02:27:43.854 --> 02:27:45.656
BEHIND AS A WHOLE. BECAUSE THE

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:50.161
MESSAGE ALL ULTIMATELY. THAT

02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:50.795
THE OVERALL MESSAGE TO FOLKS IS

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:56.267
LOOK. YOU CAN BE COUNTED. AND

02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:56.867
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. GOING

02:27:56.934 --> 02:27:57.435
TO BE SAFE FOR YOU TO DO IT.

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:58.202
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US

02:27:58.269 --> 02:27:59.971
NOT TO GET MIXED UP IN TO. THE

02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:01.038
DISSECTION OF IT BECAUSE

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:02.673
ULTIMATELY ME WE HELP WE NEED

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.275
TO ADDRESS THAT. REALLY REALLY

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:05.876
IMPORTANT. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:07.979
SURE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP OUR

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.313
EYES ON THE PRIZE AS WELL SO

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.349
THAT AS A WHOLE. OF FOLKS KNOW

02:28:11.415 --> 02:28:12.316
THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:15.620
TRUSTED ALLY THAT THEY HAVE IN

02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:16.220
THE STATE. THE STATE'S GOT THE

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:20.391
BACK. YEP ABSOLUTELY. WHICH IT

02:28:20.458 --> 02:28:21.125
WAS HAS BEEN HARD AT YOU KNOW

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:21.692
WHEN I'VE BEEN MEETING WITH

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:22.293
SOME FOLKS I THROW OUT ALL THE

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.694
DIFFERENT. LEGAL WAYS THAT WE

02:28:23.761 --> 02:28:25.096
CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AND IT'S

02:28:25.162 --> 02:28:26.697
STILL IT DOESN'T RESONATE AND

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.065
GIVE THEM THAT CONFIDENCE THAT

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:31.002
THEY NEED. SO THAT'S GOING TO

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:33.571
BE A CRITICAL. KIND OF HURDLE.

02:28:33.638 --> 02:28:35.840

TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SOME PEOPLE

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:32.843

EMBARKING ON AN EXISTENTIAL

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:39.857
THREAT TO CALIFORNIA RIGHT WHEN

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:40.424
MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:43.026
CENSUS IN THE COUNT. YOU THINK

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:43.594
ABOUT IT FROM THE FEDERAL

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:46.430
LEVEL. AND YET WE'RE DOING THIS

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:48.398
IN THE STATE AND SO I'M I'M

02:36:48.465 --> 02:36:51.335
WONDERING AND ALSO FEELS LIKE

02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:52.469
WE'RE KIND OF GEARING UP TO GO

TO WAR RIGHT. SO THAT'S PRETTY

02:36:55.272 --> 02:36:57.040
DISTURBING GIVEN WHAT THE

02:36:57.107 --> 02:36:59.610
OUTCOME OF THE CENSUS IS

02:36:59.676 --> 02:37:00.210
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHICH IS

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:01.278
THE DELIVERY OF FEDERAL

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:03.647
RESOURCES. SO MY ONE QUESTION

02:37:03.714 --> 02:37:05.816
WAS HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:07.551
TO KIND OF HELPING FOLKS SEE

02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:08.952
THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE

02:37:09.019 --> 02:37:09.820
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:11.655
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S ALMOST

02:37:11.722 --> 02:37:13.390
LIKE IT'S OUR ACCOUNT OUR

02:37:13.457 --> 02:37:15.592
CALIFORNIA WE'RE DOING THIS

02:37:15.659 --> 02:37:17.327
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT

02:37:17.394 --> 02:37:18.962
OUR STATE RIGHT THAT'S WHY

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:20.697
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS THAT'S

02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:21.832
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:23.801
THAT THE COUNT IS ACCURATE. SO

02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:24.868
HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF

02:37:24.935 --> 02:37:27.938
STRATEGIC THOUGHT AROUND HOW TO

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:29.640
HELP PEOPLE SEE THE DIFFERENCE

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:32.075
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:34.411
AND THEN YOU KNOW THE STATE OF

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:35.846
CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:38.015
PROACTIVELY AND POSITIVELY SORT

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:40.117
OF WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND. FOLKS

02:37:40.184 --> 02:37:41.952

02:38:00.504 --> 02:38:01.038
COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR

02:38:01.104 --> 02:38:02.272
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANT

02:38:02.339 --> 02:38:04.441
COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA IS SEEN

02:38:04.508 --> 02:38:06.410

THEY DO FEEL PART OF CALIFORNIA

02:38:10.547 --> 02:38:12.416
WE ALSO LEARN FROM THE LGBT

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:14.785
COMMUNITY THEY ALSO FEEL THAT

02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:16.553
CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED A VERY

02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:18.989
SAFE HAVEN PER SE. THAT ALLOWS

02:38:19.056 --> 02:38:21.458
THEM TO BE WHO THEY ARE ANOTHER

02:38:21.525 --> 02:38:22.793
ANOTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:24.862

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:34.938
THE CALIFORNIANS AND TO SAY

02:38:35.005 --> 02:38:37.608
THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT

02:38:37.674 --> 02:38:40.377
WE ALSO WANT TO SORT OF. YOU

02:38:40.444 --> 02:38:42.112

ARE YOU KNOW PROVIDED TO

02:38:45.315 --> 02:38:47.784
CALIFORNIA ON NOT ONLY IN THE

02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:49.119
RESOURCE LEVEL BUT WE'RE ALSO

02:38:49.186 --> 02:38:50.988
SHOULD ONE NEED TO EDUCATE

02:38:51.054 --> 02:38:52.823
FOLKS BECAUSE OTHER PROGRAMS

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:54.458
THROUGHOUT THE STATE FEDERALLY

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:56.393
FUNDED OR STATE ALSO USE CENSUS

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:58.762
DATA TO INFORM THE PROGRAM MEET

02:38:58.829 --> 02:39:00.397
AND ALLOCATION AT THE LOCAL

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:02.032
LEVEL SO THERE'S A LOT

02:39:02.099 --> 02:39:03.967
EDUCATION THAT WERE WANTING TO

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:07.804
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WERE

02:39:07.871 --> 02:39:13.343
EXPLORING. DURING THIS PHASE.

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.311
NOT TO SAID SO YOU KNOW I'VE

02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:14.878
BEEN AT THIS FOR CASH TWO

02:39:14.945 --> 02:39:15.846
YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN RIGHT UP

02:39:15.913 --> 02:39:16.914
FRONT AND WE STILL I STILLHAVE

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.148
TO CONTINUE TO ALWAYS SEPARATE

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:18.715
BECAUSE WE SHOULD DO TRY TO

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:19.349
INVITE OUR SENSES PARTNERS TO

02:39:19.416 --> 02:39:19.983
THESE MEETINGS. THROUGH ALL THE

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:21.118
CONVENES WE DID THE TWENTY FOUR

02:39:21.184 --> 02:39:22.085
LAST YEAR WAS ALWAYS THEY WERE

02:39:22.152 --> 02:39:23.820
THERE BUT IT IS VERY CLEAR

02:39:23.887 --> 02:39:24.821
WE'RE FROM THE STATE THIS IS

02:39:24.888 --> 02:39:26.423
WHY WE'RE DOING IT. THEY'RE IN

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:27.391
CHARGE OF THE YOU KNOW THE

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:30.260
ACTUAL OPERATIONS AND I THINK

02:39:30.327 --> 02:39:32.162
I'VE BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT THE

02:39:32.229 --> 02:39:33.063
FACT THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA

02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:34.631
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE

02:39:34.698 --> 02:39:35.966
FATE OF OUR STATE IN THE HANDS

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:37.301
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND

02:39:37.367 --> 02:39:38.402
I THINK THAT A LOT OF OUR

02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:40.170
PARTNERS THAT WE ARE WORKING

02:39:40.237 --> 02:39:42.072
WITH RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ON BOARD

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:43.473
WITH THAT BUT WEEK AS WE

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.542
CONTINUE TO DO THIS EDUCATION

02:39:45.609 --> 02:39:46.743
MOTIVATION WE CONTINUE THAT

02:39:46.810 --> 02:39:49.279
MESSAGE. OF LIKE. YES IT'S A

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:51.181
FEDERAL OPERATION AND THE

02:39:51.248 --> 02:39:53.250
REASON WHY CALIFORNIA UNLIKE

02:39:53.317 --> 02:39:54.785
MANY OTHER STATES IS REALLY

02:39:54.851 --> 02:39:56.286
STEPPING UP TO A VERY HIGH TUNE

ALSO GOING TO BE NIMBLE BECAUSE

02:42:30.674 --> 02:42:32.709

PLACES. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:43.386
IF YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE

02:42:43.453 --> 02:42:45.455
GAME THAT'S BEING NIMBLE AND

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:47.357
THEN THE STATE IS NOT SO CAN

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:58.101
BEING GOOD PARTNERS IN THIS

02:42:58.168 --> 02:43:02.639

ALL OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW. I THINK

02:43:05.742 --> 02:43:09.880
THAT THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION.

02:43:09.946 --> 02:43:12.816
FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:14.050
GOVERNOR HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY

02:43:14.117 --> 02:43:18.688
STRONG. IT TYPICALLY WITH THE

02:43:18.755 --> 02:43:20.023
WITH AN ISSUE LIKE THIS YOU

02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:21.324
DEAL WITH THE CONTRACTING

02:43:21.391 --> 02:43:23.660
AGENCY IT'S VERY BUREAUCRATIC

02:43:23.727 --> 02:43:25.395
HERE'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE

02:43:25.462 --> 02:43:25.962
GOING TO DO HERE'S WHAT WE

02:43:26.029 --> 02:43:27.564
EXPECT THIS THESE ARE YOUR- THE

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:29.466

YOUR STUFF AND THAT'S AND MOVE

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:35.705
FORWARD ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN

02:43:35.772 --> 02:43:36.239
THE CASE THIS HAS BEEN AN

02:43:36.306 --> 02:43:39.109
INCREDIBLY COOPERATIVE OF VERY

02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:41.645
PRO ACTIVE. CAMPAIGN WHERE THE

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:44.381
STATE HAS BEEN CERTAINLY IN

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:46.850
TERMS OF OUR OWN INTERACTION

02:43:46.917 --> 02:43:49.219
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY A

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:50.954
COOPERATIVE AND I THINK IT'S

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:53.623
REFLECTIVE OF THAT SAME SPIRIT

02:43:53.690 --> 02:43:55.458
OF WANTING TO GET THIS DONE I

02:43:55.525 --> 02:43:57.427
ALSO WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE

02:43:57.494 --> 02:44:00.030
COMMUNITY GROUPS OF THAT HAVE

02:44:00.096 --> 02:44:02.599
BEEN ALREADY ON THE GROUND YOU

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.134
KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT WITH

02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:04.968
SOME OF THEM I THINK THERE

02:44:05.035 --> 02:44:07.304
THERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF.

02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:08.471
UNEASINESS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

02:44:08.538 --> 02:44:10.640
GET GOING AND I THINK THAT'S

02:44:10.707 --> 02:44:12.876
VERY HEALTHY TENSION WHICH WE

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:14.110
LOOK WE NEED WE WANT TO HEAR

02:44:14.177 --> 02:44:15.812
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS

02:44:15.879 --> 02:44:16.913
THAT ALREADY GOING ON THAT

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.248
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN FROM YOU

02:44:18.315 --> 02:44:19.649
KNOW THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN

02:44:19.716 --> 02:44:21.451
REST ASSURE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN

02:44:21.518 --> 02:44:22.819
IS ISN'T THIS WILL NOT BE A TOP

02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:25.021
DOWN. A CAMPAIGN THIS IN

02:44:25.088 --> 02:44:26.489
OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE SOME

02:44:26.556 --> 02:44:28.458
TOP DOWN BUT THERE WILL BE A

02:44:28.525 --> 02:44:29.426
LOT OF BOTTOM UP AND I THINK

02:44:29.492 --> 02:44:30.493
THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.996
IMPORTANT HERE AS TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:33.063 --> 02:44:34.831
HAVE THE KIND OF TEAM THAT IS

02:44:34.898 --> 02:44:37.968
READY AND WILLING TO MAKE

02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:39.936
CHANGES TO ADAPT TO THE

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.137
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

02:44:41.204 --> 02:44:46.977
MIGHT THAT MIGHT COME UP. BUT

02:44:47.043 --> 02:44:52.649
AT THE SAME TIME. BOB. 80% OF

02:44:52.716 --> 02:44:54.050
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. IS GONNA

02:44:54.117 --> 02:44:54.618

ABLE TO FOLLOW AT IN TRACK. THE

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:56.052
REST YOU HAVE TO CALL US INTO A

CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT'S GOING

02:44:57.354 --> 02:44:57.921
ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER

02:44:57.988 --> 02:44:59.189
IS THAT I FEEL THAT THE YOU

02:44:59.256 --> 02:45:00.156
HAVE A GREAT TEAM IN PLACE AT

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:02.025
THE STATE LEVEL AND CERTAINLY.

02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.832
EXCEPTIONAL GROUPS AND WHEN

EXAMPLE A MESSAGE IN SAN DIEGO

02:46:43.159 --> 02:46:44.627
WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AND

02:46:44.694 --> 02:46:46.696
HUMBLED. A MESSAGE IN CENTRAL

02:46:46.763 --> 02:46:47.330
VALLEY WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT

02:46:47.397 --> 02:46:49.232
THAN SALINAS ARE WATSONVILLE.

02:46:49.299 --> 02:46:50.767
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE VERY

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:52.869
MUCH MINDFUL AND ALSO. THAT

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:58.074
BURKE CREEK. CAN FULLY AND

02:46:58.141 --> 02:47:04.047
EXECUTE IN A TIMELY MATTER. I'D

02:47:04.114 --> 02:47:06.082
LIKE TO SHARE ONE. THING THAT

02:47:06.149 --> 02:47:07.183
WAS VERY CLEAR AS WHEN WE

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:08.118
FIRST. WHY AM WENT THROUGH THE

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.586
RP PROCESS AND THEN WE WERE

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:10.420
AWARDED THE CONTRACT OUR FIRST

02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:11.221
DELIVERABLE WITH OUR CALMS

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:12.722
PLAN. AND OUR REQUIREMENT WAS

02:47:12.789 --> 02:47:16.092
ONE COMES PLAN. WE AND THE

02:47:16.159 --> 02:47:18.695
STATE WORK TOGETHER TO SAY.

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:19.295
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WITH

02:47:19.362 --> 02:47:19.963
THIS TYPE OF A PLAN SO IT WAS A

02:47:20.029 --> 02:47:21.731
DEMONSTRATION OF THE TWO

02:47:21.798 --> 02:47:23.333
ENTITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO BE

02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.668
NIMBLE AND REACTIVE TO WHAT WE

02:47:25.735 --> 02:47:26.970
NEED AND NOT JUST SAYING THIS

02:47:27.036 --> 02:47:29.906

02:53:43.279 --> 02:53:44.380
WE CALL AS THE CHICANO

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:48.751
COMMUNITY IS NOT THE SAME. AS

02:53:48.818 --> 02:53:51.053
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SORRY I

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:53.689
WANNA BRING THAT OUT I THINK

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:57.193
THEY ARE THE LARGEST. IN TERMS

02:53:57.260 --> 02:53:58.060
OF NUMBERSIN PERCENTAGE THE

02:53:58.127 --> 02:53:59.695
LARGEST OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY

02:53:59.762 --> 02:54:03.533
NOT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SO

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:04.667
THAT'S WHEN THEY WANT TO BRING

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:06.903
TO YOUR ATTENTION A SECOND IS

02:54:06.969 --> 02:54:09.338
WE PUSHED REALLY HARD IN OUR-

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:14.143
SUBCOMMITTEE ON. ON THE BUDGET

02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:17.079
PUSHED REALLY HARD FOR SCHOOLS.

02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:19.949
TO BE UP INCLUDED IN THIS WE

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:21.250
RAISE THE BUDGET A LITTLE BIT

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:23.853
MORE TO REACH THEM BUT THERE IS

02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:25.221
NOT A SINGLE COMMUNITY IN THE

02:54:25.288 --> 02:54:28.357
ENTIRE STATE. THAT DOESN'T HELP

02:54:28.424 --> 02:54:30.860
THE SCHOOL. I DON'T CARE HOW

02:54:30.927 --> 02:54:32.962
HARD YOU ARE TO COUNT. YOUR

02:54:33.029 --> 02:54:36.599
KIDS GO TO A SCHOOL. AND IT

02:54:36.666 --> 02:54:39.669
SEEMS TO ME THERE'S GOTTA BE A

02:54:39.735 --> 02:54:43.105
WAY TO GET THAT INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:46.542
OF THAT WILL REACH THE PARENTS

02:54:46.609 --> 02:54:48.377
INVOLVED IN THIS AND I KNOW IN

02:54:48.444 --> 02:54:50.913
TERMS OF ORGAN IS ORGANIZING

02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:53.916
AND REACHING OUT TO THEM BUT IS

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:56.552
THERE A WAY. OF THROUGH OUR-

02:54:56.619 --> 02:54:58.154
BROADLY SPEAKING COMMUNICATIONS

02:54:58.221 --> 02:55:00.656
STRATEGY THE GETS TO THEM IT

02:55:00.723 --> 02:55:02.792
WOULD BE A REAL SHAME AND I

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:03.659
KNOW THEY'LL BE SCHOOL

02:55:03.726 --> 02:55:06.596
DISTRICTS THAT INVEST AND TRY

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:08.164
TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE TRUTH

02:55:08.231 --> 02:55:10.266
IS I DON'T THINK WITH WHAT

02:55:10.333 --> 02:55:12.001
THEIR PRIMARY MISSION IS WHICH

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:13.569
IS EDUCATION. I DON'T THINK

02:55:13.636 --> 02:55:16.038
THEY'LL PUT THE ENERGY AND THEY

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:17.373
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:22.378
IT SO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

02:55:22.445 --> 02:55:23.946
AND THE OF COURSE YOUNG ADULTS.

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:25.982
WHERE WOULD SECRETARY BY THE A

02:55:26.048 --> 02:55:27.650
HE'S REACHED OUT TO YOUNG

02:55:27.717 --> 02:55:30.286
ADULTS THEY NOW CAN REGISTER TO

02:55:30.353 --> 02:55:31.320
VOTE BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN

02:55:31.387 --> 02:55:34.557
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. THERE IS AN

02:55:34.624 --> 02:55:37.393
ENORMOUS AND THERE IS I THINK A

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.295
AN ANXIOUSNESS ON THEIR PART TO

02:55:39.362 --> 02:55:40.897
BE INVOLVED. THEY WANT TO BE

02:55:40.963 --> 02:55:43.833
INVOLVED HOW DO WE TAP OF THAT

02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:46.702
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THROUGH.

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:50.006
THE ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA. SOME

02:55:50.072 --> 02:55:52.541
SOME WAY THAT THIS THAT THEY

02:55:52.608 --> 02:55:55.211
CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS THE

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:58.981
INCARCERATED. I HAVE NO IDEA

02:55:59.048 --> 02:56:03.686
WHAT THE. WHAT IT YOU KNOW THE

02:56:03.753 --> 02:56:04.320
LEGALITIES I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

02:56:04.387 --> 02:56:06.789
DO THAT BUT- WE ARE ALL TRYING

02:56:06.856 --> 02:56:08.658
VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:09.191
BOTH INCARCERATED FORMALLY

02:56:09.258 --> 02:56:10.293
INCARCERATED. BUT THE

02:56:10.359 --> 02:56:15.264
INSTITUTIONS. OF THAT HAVE

02:56:15.331 --> 02:56:18.167
INCARCERATED OUR COMMUNITIES IS

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:20.436
THERE A WAY OF INCLUDING THEM

02:56:20.503 --> 02:56:23.272
WE WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE

02:56:23.339 --> 02:56:24.240
THEY'RE PART OF THE COMMITTEES

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:26.409
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:29.812
RELEASED THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS.

02:56:29.879 --> 02:56:31.914
YOU KNOW NOT PART OR FROM

02:56:31.981 --> 02:56:35.351
