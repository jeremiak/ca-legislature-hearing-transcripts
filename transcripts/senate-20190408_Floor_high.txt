WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WALK INTO THESE CHAMBERS. AND TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK. BUT WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT. WHO WERE THE FIRST TO SIT HERE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO? BUT TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT THAT. IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO OUR PREDECESSORS SAT IN THIS ROOM. FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ADMITTED AS THE THIRTY FIRST STATE INTO THE UNION IN? EIGHTEEN FIFTY IT WASN'T UNTIL EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THAT THIS LEGISLATURE VOTED TO MAKE SACRAMENTO THE PERMANENT HOME OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. IN THAT TIME IN BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL WAS LOCATED IN VARIOUS CITIES. INCLUDING SAN JOSE AND OUR OWN FIFTEENTH SENATORIAL DISTRICT. AND BOTH BENICIA AND VALLEJO BOTH IN THE THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT. AT EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR SACRAMENTO OFFICIALLY BECAME THE SEAT OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. AT EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THIS BILL BUILDING. MEMBERS BECAME OUR HOME. IT WAS HERE IN THIS BUILDING THAT THE ORIGINAL FOR CODES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE WRITTEN IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THE CIVIL CODE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE THE PENAL CODE. AND THE POLITICAL COAT. IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IT WAS HERE IN THIS BUILDING THAT WE CREATED THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS REPOSE BALLOT INITIATIVES IT WAS HERE AT THAT TIME IN THIS BUILDING THAT WE ESTABLISH THE EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. AND WORKERS COMP IT WAS HERE IN THIS BUILDING AT THAT TIME THAT WE BECAME THE SIX STATE. GIVE WOMEN'S THE RIGHT WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN.

NINETEEN NINETY NINE IN PREPARING FOR HIS RESOLUTION WE FOUND THE REMARKS IN PREPARING FOR THIS RESOLUTION WE FOUND THE MARKS OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WILLIAM HOLDEN. WHO HERE ON DECEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE CONVENE THE LEGISLATURE IN THESE CHAMBERS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME? ON THAT DATE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK NOON HE CALLED THE SENATE TO ORDER TO ADDRESS THE SENATORS. AND HE SAID. AMONG OTHER THINGS. LET US SEE TO IT.
