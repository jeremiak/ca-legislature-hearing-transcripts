AND GET STARTED HERE. FOR THIS JOINT -- JOINT MEETING -- WE WILL -- HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN OWNED BY. THE CHAIRS AND OTHER MEMBERS TO COME IN IF THEY IF THEY WISH AS MOST OF PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE ON ON TODAY IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY ALREADY WITH THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS AND APPRECIATE PEOPLE -- PEOPLE COMING UP TO JOIN US TODAY SO GOOD AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES IN HEALTH CARE IS AFFORDABILITY. AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTIONS AFFORDABLE TREATMENTS AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND ALTHOUGH WE CAN CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO MAKE PREMIUMS MORE AFFORDABLE WE CAN'T FORGET. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AFFORDABILITY WITHOUT COST CONTAINMENT. CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR PREMIUMS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND SOME OF STOP PAYING FOR COVERAGE ALL TOGETHER. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S ME TREMENDOUS GAINS AS A RESULT OF THE ACA IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS STILL QUITE A WAYS TO GO. WITHOUT FURTHER STATE ACTION THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN STATE COULD RISE FROM THREE AND A HALF MILLION AS REPORTED AND FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWO FOUR MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE AT LEAST ONE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO REMAIN UNINSURED DESPITE BEING ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE TO COVER CALIFORNIA. WITH OR WITHOUT SUBSIDIES. PREMIUM SO CITIES ARE BASED ON A FORMULA POVERTY LEVEL WITH THE UPPER LIMIT SET BY THE ACA AT FOUR TIMES THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT. THIS MAKING THIS THIS MAY BE HELPFUL TO SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT NOT ENOUGH INCLUDING THE MIDDLE CLASS FOUR TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS EQUIVALENT TO FIVE TIMES THAT LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA AND SIX TIMES AT MORE COSTLY AREAS OF THE STATE. LAST YEAR WE PROPOSED A BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PACKAGE OF BILLS AND BUDGET ITEMS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AMONG THOSE PROPOSALS WERE BILLS OFFER BY MID POCKET BY MR CHIU MISTER FRIEDMAN AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA TO TACKLE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. BUT THESE BILLS EITHER LANGUAGE TO TO COSTA WERE VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THIS YEAR I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION SIMILAR MS FRIEDMAN'S BILL LAST YEAR WHICH IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE COST OF PREMIUMS MORE AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY OUTSIDE OF THE SUBSIDY ELIGIBLE RANGE. AND SO FAR THIS YEAR AT LEAST THREE OTHER BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE AND THE AND THE ASSEMBLY. DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS REDUCING THE RATE OF UNINSURED. A RECENT FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES ARE MAKE ARE HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT. COVER CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE A TWENTY THREE POINT 7% DROP IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CONSUMER SIGNING UP FOR COVERAGE IN. TWENTY NINETEEN A REFER TO THOSE POLICY CHANGES IN WASHINGTON DC. AS DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS. EITHER HAVE THE MAYBE THE CALL THEM BY SIMPLE ANOTHER SYMBOL NAME WHICH IS SABOTAGE. ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO THROUGH HIS A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS IS INVESTED IMPROVING AND EXPANDING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. UP FOR ALL THE PEOPLE CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. AND THIS IN THE FIELD TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES AND THE BEARS TO ENROLLMENT IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. POTENTIAL FUNDING IN IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERED -- CONSIDERATIONS ALSO BE. DISCUSSED ABOUT. OUR SPEAKERS INCLUDE LARA LUCIA HEALTH CARE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FROM UC BERKELEY. A LABOR CENTER PETER LEAVE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COVER CALIFORNIA. RIGHT WILL SEE THE PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF TODAY'S HEARING AT THE END OF OUR AGENDA IN ORDER TO ENSURE ALL WHO WISH TO SPEAK OF WILL THAT WILL ASK FOR A LIMIT OF TWO MINUTES ALL THE WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER WE HAVE GRANTED FIVE MINUTES. TO LET ME -- TRIES OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE -- DOCTOR ARAMBULA SAY A FEW WORDS AND THEN AND THEN DOCTOR PAN AND OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU. NOT USED TO GOING BEFORE SENATORS AND MAYBE IT'S APPROPRIATE SINCE WERE USED TO TIME LIMITS AND BUT WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING BOTH CHAIRMAN WOULD IN CHAIRMAN PAN FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON INCREASING HEALTH INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT AND I SPENT OVER THIRTY HOURS LAST YEAR AND ARE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION. HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES AS A STATE IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HAVE EXPANDED COVERAGE TO SO MANY AMERICANS. AND CALIFORNIANS. I AM GRATEFUL TO THE PANELISTS WHO HAVE JOINED US TODAY. ESPECIALLY FROM COVER CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO THIS EFFORT. ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE THREATS THAT ARE COMING FROM OUR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. WELL WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN HEALTHCARE WE STILL HAVE FURTHER TO GO TO REACH UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND A PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THAT IS TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE. FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR STATE BAY ON WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE CARE. AND PAY FOR IT DESPITE HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. AND ALSO DESPITE MANY CONSUMERS RECEIVING PREMIUM TAX CREDITS AND COST SHARING SUPPORTS. MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES ARE JUST TOO EXPENSIVE. I AM PLEASED TO SEE SO MANY PROPOSALS WE PUT FORWARD. AND THOSE THAT WE HEARD FROM ADVOCATES AND ARE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND IN MY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES LAST YEAR. NOW RECOGNIZED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. I AM GRATEFUL THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME AGAIN IS PLEDGING HIS DEDICATION TO THE AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTHCARE IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS EARLIER TODAY. I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT AND BUILD ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY TO HELP US TO ANALYZE OUR CURRENT OPTIONS ON AFFORDABILITY PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON HOW WE WILL FUND AND IMPLEMENT THESE IDEAS. IN ORDER TO HELP US TO REACH OUR GOALS. THANK YOU AGAIN TO MY FELLOW CO CHAIRS ON THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO OUR FELLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND TO OUR PANELISTS FOR YOUR EXPERTISE THAT YOUR SHARING WITH US TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK -- BOTH -- CHAIR AND DOCTOR WOULD AND CHAIR KNOCKED ARAMBULA. FOR YOUR WORK IN YOUR STAFF'S WORK ON A PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME. MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE BUDGET SO HUMAN SERVICES -- PROUD TO HAVE MY VICE CHAIR -- CENTER STONE AS WELL AS SIR HER CONDO HERE AND ACTUALLY THEY SAID ON BOTH OF THOSE COMMITTEES AS WELL WITH ME SO WE HAVE. TO THAT -- TEAM HERE -- LOOKING VERY MUCH WORKING -- CLEVERLY WITH ALL OF YOU ON MANY IMPORTANT HEALTH POLICY FISCAL ISSUES THEY'LL COME BEFORE US THIS YEAR -- IT'S NOT REFLECT THAT -- WHEN I WAS -- CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE YOU KNOW SITTING THAT SURE WE WERE PASSING THAN USUAL LEGISLATION ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY. COVERED CALIFORNIA AND EXCHANGE AND SO FORTH AND AND SINCE THAT TIME HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD AND NOT ONLY IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT IMPROVING ON IT. EXPANDING ACCESS AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DRESSING AFFORDABILITY. WELL WE ARE TAKING ACTION UNFORTUNATELY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE SEEN EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE ACA INCLUDING -- EFFORTS TO DESTABILIZE THE INSURANCE MARKET WHICH LED TO THEM THIS YEAR ALONE A 5% INCREASE IN HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. THAT IS THE WRONG WAY TO GO SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING OUR SPEAKERS TODAY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE ACA MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE AND SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND SAID VIRTUALLY SENSE OUR TOP THEY CROSSES BOTH POLICY FISCAL COMMITTEES IT'S REALLY IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE OPTIONS ON PLEASETHAT WE'RE DOING THIS KIND OF QUAD COMMITTEE HEARING HERE. AND SINCE ONLY THIS IS NOT ISSUE AND I ONCE AGAIN THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK LAST YEAR AND LAYING THE GROUNDWORK. BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER BOTH HOUSES BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND MOVE THIS FORWARD. SO WELL WITH THAT -- AGAIN THANK YOU -- BOTH CHAIR WOULD AND NOW AFTER WE ALLOW OTHER MEMBERS THEN I WILL GO AHEAD INTRODUCE OUR FIRST SPEAKER THINKING WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN DOCTOR AND WE LIVE UNDER THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE GET STARTED SEEING NONE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MIGHT VERY MUCH -- CHAIR KNOCKED WOULD SO OUR FIRST PANELIST TODAY IS -- LAURA LAUREL LOOSE LUCY YEAH -- WHO'S THE HEALTH PROGRAM CARE PROGRAM DIRECTOR OVER THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THE SLIDES THAT YOU WILL BE PRESENTING SO VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR A MARKS REGARDING AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS AS A BARITONE MOMENT AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET THANK YOU AND WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON. AT AS DOCTOR PAN SAID I'M LAURA LY CNN THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE PROGRAM AT THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR RESEARCH ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE UNDER THE ACA AND ALSO THE AFFORDABILITY TO CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN. I WANTED TO START BY REVIEWING THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE -- SPECIFICALLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO GENERALLY DON'T HAVE JOB BASED INSURANCE BY COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN. BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THERE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN THAT MARKET. AND A AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE AROUND TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE ENROLLED. AND A LOT OF THAT ENROLLMENT INCREASE IS DUE TO THE SUBSIDIES -- THAT ARE PROVIDED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT ARE ALSO DUE TO OTHER. FACTORS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH IS BEING ZEROED OUT THIS YEAR. UNDER FEDERAL POLICY LIKE THE REQUIREMENT THAT INSURERS OFFERED ALL REGARDLESS OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THE STRONG OUT REGION IN MOMENT. EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY COVERED CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH -- THAT WE'VE SEEN. SO THEIR APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO GET PREMIUM SUBSIDIES -- THROUGH THE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA -- THOSE ARE ALSO CqC PREMIUM SUBSIDIES ARE ALSO CALLED ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX CREDITS OR EAT PTC'S. AND PEOPLE WHO WITH INCOME BELOW ROUGHLY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE PERSON OR NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. AND THEY HAVE AN AVERAGE VALUE OF AROUND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH -- THAT THEORY BASED ON INCOME. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WHO GET PREMIUM SUBSIDIES THEY'RE COVERED CALIFORNIA ALSO GET HELP WITH FINDING. OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THROUGH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS AND OTHER COST SHARING AND THAT'S A ALSO REFERRED TO AS COST SHARING REDUCTIONS OR CSR. AND AND THESE ARE AVAILABLE TO A RELEASE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE AN AVERAGE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. DEPENDING ON INCOME AND ALSO DEPENDING ON MEDICAL USE. SO EVEN THOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DE FUNDED AS THE FEDERAL PAYMENTS FOR THESE COST SHARING REDUCTIONS -- CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES STILL SEE -- THIS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND A IN WE CAN TALK MORE IN A QUESTIONING -- LISTED IT AS THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT WITHOUT A LARGE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. SO THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE HOW MUCH PEOPLE -- WHO ARE RECEIVING SUBSIDIES PAY? ON A MONTHLY BASIS THE AVERAGE -- NET PREMIUM CONTRIBUTION BY CONSUMERS INCOMING CALIFORNIA WITH SUBSIDIES IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THAT SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE RANGE OF AND SUBSIDIZED PREMIUMS OF AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH ALL THE WAY UP TO OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THOSE THAT UNSUBSIDIZED PREMIUM RANGE VARIES. BASED ON REGION AND ALSO BASED ON AIDS EVEN THOUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LIMITED HOW MUCH PREMIUMS CAN VERY BASED ON AGE OLDER PEOPLE -- IS STILL CAN PAY UP TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE. SO WITH THE SUBSIDIES TO COVER CALIFORNIA AND THE OTHER AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROTECTIONS IN THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION -- WE'VE SEEN AN INSURANCE DROP SIGNIFICANTLY -- UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE END THAT'S DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND ALSO THE STEPS THE STATE HAS TAKEN -- TO HELP PROTECT THAT PROGRESS IN THE FACE OF A FEDERAL TEAMS AS SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AN INSURANCE RATE FOR THE NON ELDERLY IN CALIFORNIA DROP FROM AROUND SEVENTEEN POINT 6% BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TO TEN POINT 4% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THAT AN INSURANCE RATE COULD START CREEPING BACK UP -- TO TWELVE OR 13% IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY BEINGS THERE ABOUT. SO WE PROJECT THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS COULD BE UNINSURED WITHOUT FURTHER STATE ACTION AND THAT COULD GROW TO FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE OF THOSE FOUR MILLION UNINSURED UNDOCUMENTED MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP BUT THE NEXT LARGEST GROUP IS THE MAIN APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS I'VE HIGHLIGHTED HERE. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA IT BUT WOULD NOT BE ENROLLED UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS AND HALF OF THEM? WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES UNDER THE ACA AND HALF WOULD NOT -- BE ELIGIBLE DUE TO THEIR INCOME IN. AS SO THIS THIS AS DAVID JUST SHOWS THAT THOSE WHO WOULD BE UNANSWERED IN ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA OR SPREAD ACROSS A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE CALIFORNIA REMAIN UNANSWERED -- IT. THE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY DATA SHOWS THAT COST AS THE TOP REASON FOR LACKING INSURANCE AMONG THIS GROUP. AND THAT'S TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHICH INCOME LEVEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT SO AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS NOT ONLY PERSIST FOR THOSE WHO REMAIN UNANSWERED. BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO FOR SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE ENROLLED IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. AS THIS IS A FROM A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD AMONG CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL MARKET ROWLEY'S AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AMONG INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES ROUGHLY FOUR OUT OF TEN REPORTED SOME OR A LOT OF DIFFICULTY AND AFFORDING PREMIUMS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE TRENDS ARE ARE RELATIVELY SIMILAR ACROSS INCOME LEVELS. ABOUT THREE OUT OF TEN INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES REPORTED A DIFFICULTY WITH OUT OF POCKET COSTS WITH THE SLIGHTLY SMALLER SHARE OF THE HIGHER INCOME -- AMONG THIS GROUP REPORTING THOSE DIFFICULTIES. SO THESE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE AN ROLES. FIRST -- THE SAME SURVEY SHOWED THAT -- OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES. WHO NEEDED CARE REPORTED THAT THEY EITHER DELAYED OR DID NOT GET CARE DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT COST? A ALMOST A THIRD OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORTED SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL STRESS RELATED TO THE COST OF CARE AS SOME BORROWED MONEY TO PAY FOR CARE SOME CUT OTHER NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD OR HOUSING TO PAY FOR CARE. AND SOME. EXPERIENCED BOTH TYPES OF FINANCIAL STRESS. SO I WANT TO FOCUS FOR A MINUTE JUST ON THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUBSIDIES. THIS GRAPH SHOWS. HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON PREMIUMS AS A SHARE OF INCOME? WHICH RANGES FROM AROUND 2% OF INCOME AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVELS TO ALMOST 10% AT THE HIGHER INCOME LEVELS -- WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH OUT OF POCKET COSTS SOME PEOPLE WITH TYPICAL HEALTHCARE USE CAN SPEND MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTHCARE COSTS? AND PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MEDICAL USE CAN SPEND UP 22230% OF INCOME ON HEALTHCARE COSTS. TO TAKE ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AS SINGLE PERSON EARNING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS. ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR SOMEONE WORKING FULL TIME SO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE SOMEONE EARNING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. ON PREMIUMS -- FOR THE SEX OVER PLAN WHICH IS THE THE BENCHMARK PLAN. AND DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAYING FOR VINCE AND WHETHER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THAT COULD BE CHALLENGING FOR SOMEONE AT THAT INCOME LEVEL. SO THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF THE A COUPLE. AND WHO EARNS A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUBSIDIES SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IT TO FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLDS LIVING IN SAN MATTEO AND EARNING ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS COUPLE WOULD PAY A COMBINED TOTAL OF OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN PREMIUMS THAT'S MORE THAN 20% OF THEIR INCOME JUST ON PREMIUMS. ON TOP OF THAT THEY'D HAVE TO PAY THE FULL COST FOR ANY HEALTH CARE THEY USE. A IT ED BEYOND THE FIRST THREE OUTPATIENT VISITS WHICH THEY COULD THEY COULD GET WITH A COPAY BUT BEYOND THAT THEY'D HAVE TO PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE UP TO THE SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE -- THAT APPLIES TO EACH OF THEM. AT THE END SO THIS EXAMPLE IS REALLY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THE THERE'S SIGNIFICANT AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE ABOVE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHERE THE ECA CLIFF ENDS ARE IS. A AND ALSO ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER INDIVIDUALS WHO FACE HIGHER PREMIUMS. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS EXAMPLE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM THE RISING THE RAPIDLY RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS. OF THE WITCHER PROBLEM ACROSS OUR ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- BUT ALSO THE FACT TO A INDIVIDUALS AT LIKE THIS EXAMPLE. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD MENTION IN INTRODUCTION THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE. ADDS TO THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE WITH HEALTHCARE WITH THE HIGH COST THE MONEY LEFT OVER IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS -- FOR HEALTH CARE AFTER PAYING FOR RENT IN CHILD CARE AND OTHER EXPENSES -- IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S PREMIUM ASSISTANCE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COST OF LIVING. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT FOUR TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS THE UPPER INCOME LIMIT FOR PREMIUM SUBSIDIES -- IS EQUIVALENT TO FIVE TIMES THAT LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE AND SIX TIMES THAT LEVEL AND A HIGH COST REGION LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. AND SO MORE ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. AT THE LOWER INCOME LEVELS AND ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED UP TO A HIGHER INCOME LEVELS. SO TO SUM UP WE WE'VE MADE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLMENT LEVELS AND AFFORDABILITY. BUT THERE ARE MULTIFACETED -- CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY NOT ONLY FOR THAT INST UNINSURED BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE INSURANCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET -- FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUBSIDIES AND FOR MIDDLE CLASS CONSUMERS WHO ARE INTO MUCH ESPECIALLY OLDER INDIVIDUALS. AND TO THE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT PREMIUMS BUT ALSO OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE AND NOT ONLY AN INSURANCE BUT ALSO AND CAN CREATE BARRIERS TO CARE AND FINANCIAL AND SECURITY. AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING TODAY ABOUT POLICY OPTIONS AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SCEA. SO -- IT'S QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS RE MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION -- I AM I A AND THE AND THE INFORMATION IS REALLY INTERESTING AND AND SOBERING FOR SOME PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY -- YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT COST SHARING REDUCTIONS CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE. YES SO THOSE THAT'S THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS THAT'S OFFERED TO PEOPLE WHO EARNED TOO AND TO HIS INCOME IS EQUIVALENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND OR LESS. THAT'S ASSISTANCE THEY GET ON TOP OF PREMIUM SUBSIDIES -- AND AS IT USED TO AND I REGIONALLY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- THAT ASSISTANCE WAS REIMBURSED TO INSURERS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENDED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THAT MECHANISM BUT WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE -- IT IT IS -- INSTRUCTED INSURERS -- TO CONTINUE TO PRIDE THAT THAT COST SHARING ASSISTANCE BUT THE COST OF THAT IS THEN ADDED TO THE PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN PLANS AND COVERE CALIFORNIA THE SILVER PLANS -- AND SINCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ENROLLING IN THE SILVER PLANS TO COVER CALIFORNIA RECEIVINGPREMIUM SUBSIDIES. THE COST IS ULTIMATELY PAID VIA THE THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU. AND I'M YOU KNOW THIS NUMBER WAS SEEN BEFORE IN IT SO IT IT IT IS A LITTLE MIND BOGGLING TO ME STILL. THAT WE STILL HAVE NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT THAT DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT -- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW WE HOW WE HOW WE CLOSE THAT GAP YEAH. AND IT IT IS A LARGE NUMBER AND I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH MORE INVESTIGATION INTO WHY THEY'RE UNINSURED I MEAN -- TO EXPLANATIONS ARE SOME OF THE MAY NOT REALIZE THERE AND THEN SHARED A OTHERS. MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENROLLING OR MAYBE UNANSWERED FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME -- TO I THINK A WE SHOULD CONTINUES INTO THE STRONG EFFORTS. TO TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW WHETHER ELIGIBLE FOR AND TO HELP THEM AND RULE -- AND ALSO LOOK IT EFFORTS -- TO ENROLL PEOPLE IN IN MORE AUTOMATIC WAYS WHEN THEY'RE ENROLLED IN OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT AND INDICATE THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OR WHEN THEY UNDERGO A CERTAIN LIFE TRANSITIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO ALSO EXPERIENCE A A CHANGE IN HEALTH INSURANCE. OTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT SO I HAVE A COUPLE -- SO FOR FIRST OF ALL I AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- IN IN TERMS OF WE'VE WE POINTED I THINK -- SAID -- DOC WOULD POINTED OUT WE HAVE MILLION PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL -- TO AREN'T SIGNED UP WE ALSO. KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS CLIFF AT 4100% OF A THIRD PARTY LEVEL BUT I ALSO NOTE THAT -- WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND YOU DO GET SUBSIDIES -- WHO HAVEN'T SIGNED UP EITHER -- SO MAYBE IT'S THE SAME ANSWER BUT DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE THINK -- SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- INVITATIONS THEY SPECULATE IF THE DANNY DATA THAT'S OUT THERE ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT AND IS IT -- LACK A YOU KNOW THAT THESE HEARING OUT OF THE MANDATE THAT MIGHT BE ARE OF WHAT WHAT ARE SOME WELL ACTUALLY. WHAT WERE SOME THE THINGS THAT -- WE MIGHT DO TO ENGAGE -- THOSE THOSE FOLKS SURE SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUBSIDIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY DATA AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN ENROLLED ARE ASKED WHY DO YOU REMAIN IN THE ROLE OF THE COST IS DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST THREE WE DO PROJECTED THAT GROUP. WILL GROW -- WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY BEING ELIMINATED -- BUT AS FOR MANY THE THE SUBSIDIES JUST ARE NOT ENOUGH -- AND AND AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH COST OF LIVING AND FINANCIAL AND SECURITY AND NOT HAVING THAT THE ROOM AND THEIR FAMILIES BUDGETS TO TO PAY FOR THOSE PREMIUMS -- WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY HEALTHIER AND PERHAPS USE HEALTH CARE SERVICES LESS THAN PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP -- I'D I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OUR EXACT ESTIMATES ON THAT BIT THERE CERTAINLY ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED THE CARE AND MAY HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHO ARE AMONG THE UNINSURED -- AND AND SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN ASSUME THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING WITHOUT INSURANCE -- I DON'T NEED IT -- OKAY AND AS FAR AS YEAH SO WHAT ACTUALLY THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS -- OR DO YOU HAVE A TABLE WHERE YOU LOOKED AT WE SURVEYED PEOPLE ABOUT THE FIND THAT TABLE HERE -- EVERY PEOPLE ABOUT THE UPPER. PASSED THE THAT SEE HERE -- YES I THINK IT'S THE ONE ON PAGE -- EIGHT WHERE YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING THEY HAVE A CHALLENGES WITH -- DIFFICULTY PAYING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- SO WE HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO GET THE SUBSIDIES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED AND THE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS -- IN THOSE NUMBERS ARE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IT'S NOT SO -- NOW WITHFOR CZ FOUR HUNDRED PLUS THE CHALLENGES IS THAT IF YOU'RE AT 8100% YOU MIGHT NOT BE FEELING AS MUCH AS IF YOU'RE CLOSER TO FORM SOME JUST ONE IN TERMS OF THE CLIFF THE FACT. AND AND AND WITH THAT -- IN TERMS OF A SLIDE IN TERMS OF THE SURVEY DATA I I KNOW WHAT THERE'S A WAY SOMEONE ACTUALLY DRILLED INTO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSER TO FOUR HUNDRED PLUS WHO ARE. CLOSER TO FOUR HUNDRED WHEN YOU SEE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS VERSUS PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MUCH FARTHER AWAY FROM FOUR HUNDRED WHETHER. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST OVER THE BRINK -- WITH -- THAT THEY WOULD PARTICULARLY HAVE A GREATER CONCERNS ARE ISSUES WITH THAT GETTING THE COVERAGE SINCE THEY HAVE NO SUBSIDIES SO I KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO LOOK AT THAT SELL INSURANCE TERMS OF THIS FOUR HUNDRED PLUS EXACTLY HOW FAR OUT YOU'RE TALKING FROM. FOUR HUNDRED RATE AT SO THIS WAS A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD AND AND MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THEM MORE SPECIFICALLY IT GROUPS ABOUT LEVEL BUT THIS. IS THESE RESULTS WOULD INCLUDE ALL INCOME LEVELS ABOVE A 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND I GUESS ONE OTHER QUESTION AND AND I NOTICED -- WOULD BE IS TO CERTAIN EXTENT WE WERE SET CERTAIN STANDARDS RIGHT FOR SUBSIDIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME THROUGH THE ACA ETCETERA -- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THAT ONE TWENTY ON YOU THE WIND SU HI HOW LOW JUST LINE HAVE TO BE. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE HEALTH CARE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND ALL THAT BUT CERTAIN POINT LIKE WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY THAT -- THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO PUT IN YOUR INCOME TO COVER HEALTH CARE -- I MEAN SOME PEOPLE SAY SHOULD BE ZERO BUT I THINK -- BUT AT THE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL PEOPLE SHOULD BE EXPECTED BASICALLY SOMETHING INTO IT. SO AT AT ANY SENSE OF WORD INFLECTION POINT IS. IT'S A REALLY GOOD IN HARD QUESTION -- THE I THINK THE GENERAL STRUCTURE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS SET UP IN TERMS OF PEOPLE PAYING AS AS A SLIDING SCALE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME. IS IS A GOOD ONE AND I ALSO. YOU KNOW THE RECOGNITION THAT PEOPLE AT LOWER INCOME LEVELS CAN AFFORD LESS IN TERMS OF OUT OF POCKET COSTS BUT THE EXACT LEVELS ARE ARE NOT AFFORDABLE ENOUGH YET -- I I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER GOING TO BE ONE PERFECT STANDARD OF BECAUSE OFFICE OF LIVING VARIES EVEN WITHIN THE STATE AND BETWEEN FAMILIES EVEN IN THE SAME REGION BASED ON THE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES. AS BUT I THINK AS LONG AS WE'RE SEEING -- A HIGH NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE REASON FOR THAT THEY NOT SIGNED UP IS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THAT WE STILL HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM IN AS LONG AS WE SEE PEOPLE REPORTING TO SURVEYS THAT. THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE TOO HIGH I THINK IT'S AN INDICATOR THAT WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM SO -- A I GUESS THE ANSWER IS I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT TRIAL AND ERROR TO SEAMANS WE'VE IF WE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND SEE IS THAT ENOUGH THEM BECAUSE PEOPLE DO VALUE. HEALTH CARE AND WANT TO BE HEALTHY AND WHEN WHEN COST IS NOT A BARRIER -- I THINK THEY WILL IN WRONG. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- SIMILAR FRAZIER. CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SLIDE WORK SHOW THE THE ELDERLY -- YEAH SO WE HAVE THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO A MONTH -- IN THE U.. WELL OVER. FIFTY FIVE SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY. THE WORD ELDERLY. SO. THE DEFINITION I GUESS -- SO. THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO PER MONTH. THE LOOK AT A TOTAL OF COPAYS UP TO SIXTY THREE HUNDRED WHICH GOES TO ABOUT. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND CHANGE STORY. TWO THOUSAND SIX FORTY FOUR AND IF THEY MADE SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND WERE 30% TAX BRACKET YOU KNOW THE THINGS NINE TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND SO THE NET ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. SO WHAT'S AFFORDABLE ABOUT THAT YEAH THATTHAT'S WHY THIS GROUP REALLY NEEDS HELP -- IN THIS IS THAT IT WAS A FAIR FOR EVERYBODY RIGHT THIS IS THE AT A IS NOT THE EVEN THE WORST CASE EXAMPLE THIS IS A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD COUPLE NOT A SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD COUPLE BUT THIS. YEAH I THINK I THINK THIS DEMONSTRATES THE REASON WHY WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POLICY OPTIONS TODAY TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY FOR THIS GREAT. YEAH ROSE INCOME VERSES. ACTUALLY THAT WORSE IS THE CO PAYS AND ALL OF OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES AS INCLUDE PHARMACY HAS A AS THE IF THE SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT DOES I BELIEVE. THAT DOES INCLUDE PHARMACY SO. I GOT WORKABLE AND A HUNDRED YOU KNOW THAT HAS SOME KIND A MEDICAL BENEFITS BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE FOR THAT. YEAH. YES ARE CENTERED RAZA -- I'M SORRY FIVE YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS BUT WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF ANY DO YOU KNOW. ABOUT -- THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYER COVERED HEALTH CARE. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE COST. ON EVERYONE ELSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S IT'S DECREASED. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. IMPACT. OVER ONE EVERYBODY -- WELL IF YOU THINGS ABOUT THE COMPARISON BETWEEN EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET COVERAGE I THINK IS YOUR QUESTION. AS TAKE UP RATES ARE HIGHER FOR EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE -- THE AT BUT LET ME LET ME THINK ABOUT HOW TO SIMPLY SAY THIS THERE THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH COMPARING FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY BUT SHARE OF THE MARKET PAYS MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS. AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAT'S A MUCH HIGHER SHARE PAYING THAT HIGH COST BURDEN ON PREMIUMS THAN AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. AND THEN ON THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS SIDE OF THE THE COMMONWEALTH FUND. MEASURES UNDER INSURANCE OR OR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THAT COVER THEIR THEIR FINANCIAL RISK WHEN THEY NEED CARE AND UNDER INSURANCE IS MORE OF AN ISSUE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAN AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. THAT SAID -- EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE -- HAS. LAKE OUR ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM YOU KNOW THE COSTS HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY -- AND AS AN PREMIUMS WORKERS COMP PREMIUMS FOR WORKERS HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY AND THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS HAVE ALSO BEEN GROWING. HI DEDUCTIBLES AND JOB BASED COVERAGE HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY MORE COMMON -- OVER THE LAST DECADE ALTHOUGH IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. IT QUITE AS DRAMATIC TRENDS IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH OF DEDUCTIBLES AND JOB IS COVERAGE AT THE SCENE NATIONALLY. UP IT WHATEVER YOU HAVE ON THAT COULD SURE SURE THAT AS WELL PLEASE. BE HAPPY. TO OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES -- OUR CHURCH ARAMBULA. IT'S ALMOST A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO MOVE THROUGH THE THE DISCUSSION TO MAKE SURE WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT ROLE THE REPEAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE HAS HAD ON AFFORDABILITY. HAS IT MADE. PREMIUMS MORE OR LESS. WELL I THINK WE'RE WE'RE STILL EARLY AND SEEING WHAT AFFECTS THE THOSE HEARING OUT OF THE PENALTY. HAS AND WILL HAVE HAVE -- BUT THE LAST YEAR. MS AND COVERED CALIFORNIA IT DID INCREASE AND I THINK IT WAS THREE AND A HALF. THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THAT INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY GOING AWAY AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF INSURERS EXPECTATION -- THAT IT WOULD BE HEALTHIER PEOPLE AND WHO WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO DESCEND ROLE WITHOUT A PENALTY SO AS WE ARE USING YOUR EXAMPLES OF UNDER INSURANCE WE SHOULD. TAKE INTO -- LIGHT THAT THAT VANDALISM THAT OCCURRED AT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE. AND ASSESS THE TATES US AS A STATE NEEDING -- TO TRY TO REPLACE IT AS OUR GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AS WELL AS LOOKING TOWARD SUBSIDIES TO HELP MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND SO. WELL WE HAVE A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT IS UNDERMINING US I'M ENCOURAGED BY MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. AT OUR STATE WIDE LEVEL TO HELP TO DEFEND AND BUILD UPON WHAT WE'RE DOING. WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO? THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CASEY NINE AGAIN THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- TO SEE IF THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU. FOR IT WOULD BE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL HERE -- THIS ME TALKING BOUT AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS AND FUNDING OPTIONS TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. OF JOINING US WILL BE -- PETER LEAD THE EXACT DIRECTOR CAL COVER CALIFORNIA. RYAN MILLER THE ASSISTANT PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND RYAN WILL SEE THE PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLITICIAN POLICY ANALYST FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO. IN THAT ORDER SO. THANK YOU IN. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] HI [inaudible] BACK [inaudible] GOOD SHOW YOU'RE GOING. PICKING TOPIC SO FIRST -- COMMITTEE CHAIRS MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPTION TO BE WITH YOU TODAY -- AND IT WAS A GREAT PRESENTATION YOU GOT ABOUT LAME SOME OF THE GROUNDWORK EARLIER -- AS ALL OF YOU KNOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS I WON'T. REVIEW ALL OF THAT -- BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE WERE. AND WE'VE DONE THAT THROUGH HAVING A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE THROUGH ROBUST COMPETITION THROUGH -- COMMON BENEFIT DESIGNS ALL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT -- THROUGH MARKETING AND I I DON'T WANT TO DO A PARTICULAR THANK YOU TO ALMOST EVERYONE OF YOU NOT ONLY HAVE LEGISLATIVE BUT WORKING WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS OF HELP GET THE WORD OUT -- AS WE'VE TRAVELED THE STATE WE'VE HAD MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE PROMOTED ROLE MIGHT GET THE INFORMATION OUT THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S MADE IT WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- IT'S WORK IN THAT NOT ONLY HIGH AND ROLAND BUT A HEALTHY RESPECTS. OF THE WRIST MIX OF THOSE ENSURE THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET ABOUT 20% HEALTHIER THAN THE REST THE NATION. MEETING THE PREMIUMS IF WE HAVE THE SAME HEALTH STATUS. AS FOLKS DID IN OTHER STATES IN THE NATION. HEALTHCARE WOULD BE 20% MORE EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR HEALTHY RESPECTS -- ALL THAT SAID. THERE ARE CHALLENGES SUMMER ABSOLUTELY IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT FEDERAL POLICY DECISIONS SUCH AS THE REMOVAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. OTHERS ARE A IN THE NATURE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ORIGINAL STRUCTURE WAS NEVER PERFECT OUT OF THE GATE IT HAD ISSUES THAT LED TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WERE SEEN THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ISSUES. WITH REGARD TO PREMIUM STILL BEING ON AFFORDABLE CLIFF ON CHALLENGES OF COST SHARING PREMIUMS IN GENERAL. SO WITH THAT -- I'D LIKE TO START BY DOING A VERY QUICK REVIEW WHAT HAPPENED THIS MOST RECENT OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD -- AS YOU KNOW WE JUST AND OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD LAST MONTH IT WAS OUR SIX THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD -- CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB BOTH IN ROLLING TO KEEP PEOPLE KEEPING PEOPLE INJURED YOU SEE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE HERE. OUR NEW ENROLLMENTS EACH YEAR WHICH HAS BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IT DROPPED. IN. 1924%. THAT'S A VERY LARGE DROP IT'S LARGER THAN WE THOUGHT THE ESTIMATES WERE THAT THE DROP OF ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF THE REMOVAL OF THE PENALTY WOULD BE. ANYWHERE FROM 7226% WE'RE ON THE HIGH END. UP WE LOOKED AT THAT IN A ISSUE BRIEF THAT I KNOW YOU'VE ALL RECEIVED -- ON ANALYZING WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY -- AND I'D MAKE A COUPLE OBSERVATION FIRST. HOW WE COMPARE TO THE REST OF THE NATION -- ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE REST OF THE NATION OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE REST OF THE NATION THOSE PARTS OF AMERICA SIR BY THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED MARKETPLACE. HAD SEEN BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN ENROLLMENT. THEY IN ESSENCE HAD ALREADY PRICED OUT THE PEOPLE OF A ON IN THIS LAST OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD THEY SAW AN ADDITIONAL 16% DROP -- WE IN CALIFORNIA SAW A BIGGER DROP THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE. OUR CHALLENGES THE STATE IS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OTHER STATES THAT ARE PRICED -- PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SUBSIDIZED AND THAT ARE NOT SICK OUT OF COVERAGE -- THAT'S WE SEEN REST OF THE NATION. WHAT DID WE SEE IN TERMS OF WHO DID NOT SIGN UP WE DID ANALYSIS BACKWARDS UPSIDE DOWN SIDEWAYS AND FOUND A COUPLE THINGS -- FIRST SOME OF THE THEORIES OF WHO MIGHT NOT IN ROLE DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE TRUE IT WASN'T MORE LIKELY TO NOT A ROLE IF YOU WERE YOUNGER. IT TURNS OUT THAT -- YOUNG INVINCIBLE SO TO SPEAK OR NOT YOUNG AND STUPID -- THEY ACTUALLY SIGNED UP IN OR DROP COVERAGE OF THE SIMILAR. AS OTHER GROUPS OF THE TWO GROUPS THAT WE SAW SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER. DROPS IN ENROLLMENT WE'RE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR BRONZE PLANS WHICH IS A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN. BEING HEALTHIER POPULATION GENERALLY PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY BY THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN -- THAT CAUSES GREAT CONCERN THE OTHER IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER DROPS OF UNSUBSIDIZED INDIVIDUALS -- NOT A SURPRISE BUT A A TROUBLING NOTE. THE OTHER THING WE DID SEE IS SOME HIGH -- ENROLLMENT FROM NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS SPANISH SPEAKERS KOREAN CHINESE -- WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A FACTOR FROM THE PENALTY -- WE THINK THAT'S A RELATED A PUBLIC CHARGE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THAT LATER. WE DID ABSOLUTELY SEE THOUGH THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE PENALTY BECAUSE PREMIUMS TO GO UP -- WE HAD AN EIGHT POINT 7% AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE -- ABOUT HALF OF THAT WAS BECAUSE SPECIFICALLY OF HEALTH PLANS PRICING FOR THEIR EXPECTATION. THAT THERE WOULD BE A DROP OF ENROLLMENT AND HEALTHIER PEOPLE WOULD DROP. THEY ALL SAID AND WE NEGOTIATE VERY ACT WITH OUR PLANS -- WE WANTED THEM TO PRICE RIGHT WE DON'T UNDER PRICED OR OVERPRICED -- BUT THEY NOTED THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS THEY WOULD BE NEEDED TO LOOK AT THEIR PRICING FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE IN ROMAN GOES DOWN MORE NEXT YEAR YOU'LL SEE A BIGGER PREMIUM INCREASE. JUST BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH MIX SO THAT'S WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN NEXT. I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE WERE CHARGED WITH. DEVELOPING A REPORT FOR YOU. AND WE WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT REPORT IT WAS PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO DEVELOP DELIVER THIS TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. SYSTEMS COUNCIL. ON HOW TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. NOW THAT I'D NOTE THAT. YOU'LL SEE IN THIS REPORT A RANGE OF POLICY OPTIONS THAT PROVIDE A ROADMAP FOR YOU -- AND THE GOVERNOR THAT YOU CAN TAKE THEY AREN'T THEY HERE'S THE RIGHT WAY IT'S RATHER OPTIONS THEM IN A RUN THROUGH. THE IT IS VERY CLEAR THOUGH -- THAT THE PATH TO AFFORDABILITY. IS NOT ONE THAT'S BEING TAKEN IN MANY PARTS OF THE NATION -- WHERE WHAT IS BEING CALLED AFFORDABILITY IS GIVING CONSUMERS MORE CHOICE OF SHORT TERM PLANS PRODUCTS THAT ARE THERE WHEN PEOPLE NEED THEM CALIFORNIA -- THIS LEGISLATURE OUTLAWED SHORT TERM PLANS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY OFTEN SERVE AS BAIT AND SWITCH FOR CONSUMERS. AND THEY SCREEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS THEY PRICE THINGS DIFFERENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS SAID LET'S BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THAT'S WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND SOME OF THE OPTIONS. BEFORE YOU -- I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS REPORT -- WAS DEVELOPED -- WITH THE THE KEY WORK OF PEOPLE AND COVER CALIFORNIA'S POLICY TEAM A PARTICULAR KATIE RAVEL BUT ALSO -- WEST AGAIN -- FROM UCLA IN THE CLOSE TO LIMóN FROM STAKEHOLDERS MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE WITH YOU -- I THINK -- TO PROVIDE COMMENTS LATER -- BUT ALSO -- WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND A BROAD COMMUNITY INPUT -- I THINK IT'S A A GOOD READ -- THOUGH IT'S PRETTY DEEP SO I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT TO ME THE CHARTS. BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE DID IS FIRST. WE PROVIDE IT TWO APPROACHES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD DO. ONE IS WHAT WE CALL A COMPREHENSIVE COMBINATION WHICH IS SORT OF THE ALL IN STRATEGY. WHICH LAID OUT FIRST ENHANCE PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUPPORT BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW 4100% OF POVERTY -- WHICH IS BASICALLY SAYING LET'S MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE BUILT INTO THE PREMIUM AND CULTURE. SECOND OPTION LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT. IMPLEMENT A PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA THIRD LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT IS HAVE A REINSURANCE PROGRAM THAT'S WHERE THE THE COMPREHENSIVE ALL IN STRATEGY. THE OTHER OPTION. BUT WAS TO LAY OUT -- IS ME. EIGHT DISTINCT POLICY OPTIONS SO TO GIVE YOU A EIGHT TOOLS IS A LET'S PICK THIS AND THIS AND THE DATE OPTIONS ARE A MIX OF EITHER PREMIUM SUPPORT OR COST. SHARING REDUCTIONS IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM LUCIA. AND THEN A SEPARATE PIECE OF REAL MANDATE PENALTY THESE ARE ALL LAID OUT IN IN GREAT DETAIL IN THE REPORT -- A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WOULD CALL OUT AND THEN I I WON'T SPEND A MOMENT -- WITH THE TAKE AWAYS OF THIS IS -- FIRST TAKE AWAY IS THE OF THE POLICY OPTIONS IN TERMS OF THE POLICY OPTIONS BEFORE THE STATE THE WOULD HAVE. THE BIGGEST EFFECT ON ENROLLMENT -- IT'S REINSTATING THE PENALTY IS BY FAR THE WITH THE REPORT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE BOTH NOD STE TO BUY COVERAGE AND BECAUSE PREMIUMS WE LOWER WOULD HAVE BY FAR THE LARGEST EFFECT ON INCREASING ROLE. OF THE OTHERS HAVE A BUILDING AFFECT. IN TARGET DIFFERENT PEOPLE DEPENDING UP YOU'RE TARGETING SUBSIDIES ABOVE OR BELOW 40% OF POVERTY. REMEMBER BELOW 40% OF POVERTY PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON IT INCOME ADJUSTED BASIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ABOVE 40% THEY'RE GETTING NOTHING. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE BELOW 4% SO THAT THAT'S THE TRADE OFF OF THE REPORT GOES THROUGH. SO -- I WANTED TO SPEND A MOMENT -- TO TALKING SOLUTION TO THE GIVE YOU A MISSION HOPE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE CLIP. ON IN THIS IS -- FOR IT IT'S EASY TO GET LOST IN NUMBERS I A TALK ABOUT TWO ARCHETYPE PEOPLE BOTH TO LIVE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ONE HIS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. THIS SHOWS HOW MUCH IS A TAX CREDIT CURRENTLY -- AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE DARK BLUE IS A TAX CREDIT THEY GET IT THERE PUT UP TO A 100% 50% OF POVERTY. THEIR SPENDING FIFTY DOLLARS AND THE TAX CREDIT IS COVERING THE REMAINING. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S THE DARK BLUE BUT AS SOON AS THE AFFORDABLE SO POVERTY. THEY'RE GETTING NOTHING AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE 41100% OF THE PREMIUM ABOUT. YOU KNOW FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD. MAKE THAT PERSON A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND YOU'LL SEE DARK BLUE IS THE PREMIUM TAX CREDIT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE KERA. SO THAT FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD. ELDERLY PERSON A SUBJECT OF OF OF THAT -- FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD PERSON OLDER THAN -- YOU KNOW YOUNGER THAN ME BY A FEW YEARS. WOULD GET A YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD BE PAYING FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS STILL A LOT OF MONEY FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH. A CHALLENGE FOR THEM -- COVERING THEIR PREMIUM BUT THE MOMENT THEY INCH OVER THAT 4100% LINE ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE IN FOR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS ENTIRELY -- SO THAT'S THAT GIVES YOU THAT THE DISTINCTION OF WHAT IS THAT CLIP MEAN IN TERMS OF THE GRAPHICS. LET ME THEN TELL YOU THAT STORY PER TO INDIVIDUALS -- TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF BELOW 40% AND ABOVE 40%. SO THIS IS AND I WILL GIVE HUGE CREDIT WHEN YOU LOOK TO THE REPORT -- PAGE THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY THREE SPELL THESE OUT WITH A NUMBER OF HYPOTHETICAL PEOPLE THEY REALLY HELPED BRING IT HOME. IS IN THE UNDER. 40% OF POVERTY ALFONZO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD LOW COST AREA AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN A CALIFORNIA. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION GENERALLY COST 30% MORE FOR HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO -- NOW THAT'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE OTHER DOCTOR WOULD YOUR NOTE ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT WRIT LARGE IS A VERY IMPORTANT MIND AT ALL OF US. IT'S THE REALITY OUR CONSUMERS ARE SO THIS INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOW -- MAKES ABOUT OVER TO A PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL HE GETS -- QUITE A BIT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT -- HIS PREMIUM FOR THE SECOND LOWEST SILVER PLAN IS THREE FIFTY DOLLARS BUT HE ONLY PAID A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DOLLARS. BUT IF YOU'RE MAKING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PAYING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS CAN BE STEEP -- UNDER THE OPTION TO OF THE COMPREHENSIVE WHICH IS THE OPTION WITHOUT REINSURANCE WE JUST PICK ONE IS A STRONG AND WITHOUT GIVING YOU EIGHT HUNDRED ROSE -- UPON SO WE GET MORE FINANCIAL HELP STILL SPENDING FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SAME COVERAGE AND IT WOULD BE THAN 2% OF HIS INCOME INSTEAD OF 7% SIX AND A HALF PERCENT. COULD MAKE SOME SENSE. NEXT MODEL LET'S TAKE IT TO AARON FRANCIS ON SIXTY TWO YEARS OLD -- THEY MAKE. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT ABOVE GOOD BIT ABOVE I'M NOT NO ONE WOULD SAY SOMEONE MAKING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS A POOR PERSON. NOW YOU LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR TRYING TO RENT A HOUSE IT'S A CHALLENGE BUT TO SEPARATE SO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ABOUT 40% POVERTY. ON TO AFFORD. A SECOND LOW SILVER PLAN IT WOULD COST THEM TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH. OKAY -- THAT PLAN WOULD MEAN IT WOULD TAKE PREMIUM ALONE. NOT INCLUDING THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS THEN GETTING A SILVER PLAN MEETING OUT OF POCKET WOULD COVER MOST OF THEIR HEALTHCARE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY. OUT OF POCKET FOR A LOT BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE. TO BUT JUST PREMIUM. 36% OTHER IN. UP YET AS MISTER FRAZIER NOTED -- IT'S HARD TO CALL IT AFFORDABLE -- TO THAT FAMILY AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LIKE THAT IN PARTICULAR IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ABOVE. FRESNO ONE NORTH -- HAVING PREMIUM SUPPORT THAT GOES ABOVE THAT. MIGHT MEAN DEPEND ON WHAT THE LEVELS OF THESE ARE THEY STILL BE PAYING SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS -- BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT FAR MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THEM HAVING 9% OF THEIR INCOME GOING TOWARDS HEALTHCARE AND DOCTOR PAN YOUR QUESTION WHAT'S THE RIGHT LEVEL. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC ANSWER FOR THAT. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAD A GREAT DATED A GREEDY ASIANS ON INCOME THAT STARTED AT BASICALLY AT 40% OF POVERTY BUT THEN IT WAS ZERO ABOVE 40% -- IT DOES MAKE SENSE TELL PEOPLE EARN MORE HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. THEY HAVE MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME -- DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO FROM 9% THAT WAS A PROBLEM OF THE RITUAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IT'S LOOKING AT TODAY -- LAST I WANT TO JUST VERY BRIEFLY SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND. THE COMMON PATIENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED WE HAVE AND THE TWO ELEMENTS ONLY UNDERSTAND IS -- YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT DEDUCTIBLES -- I'D REMIND YOU THAT FOR EVERYTHING THAT SHADED IN BLUE IS NOT SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE. WHICH MEANS THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET BOTH WITH COVER CALIFORNIA AND THE BY DIRECTOR THEIR PLANS. WHEN THEY GET A SILVER PLAN KNOW OUTPATIENT SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE? BUT THAT STANDARD SILVER PLAN MEANS YOU GO TO A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR YOU'RE SPENDING FORTY DOLLARS. IF YOU'RE LOWER INCOME FORTY DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY. WHICH IS WHY THE COST SHARING REDUCTION PLANS. ARE SO IMPORTANT. AND DEPENDING ON YOUR INCOME YOU WON'T SPEND FORTY DOLLARS TO SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU'RE QUITE LOW INCOME AT ABOUT A 150% OF POVERTY IT'S FIVE DOLLARS IF YOU MAKE MORE MAYBE IT'S THIRTY FIVE OR FIFTEEN BUT THAT'S JUST TO MAKE REAL THIS WHOLE COST SHARING REDUCTION. SUBSIDIES IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS THING FOR THE PLANS IT IS NOT FOR THE HEALTH PLANS. IT HELPS CONSUMERS GET CARE MAKES IT AFFORDABLE SO IF YOU HAVE -- IF YOU'RE MAKING. TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND YOU'RE TOLD. YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND FORTY DOLLARS TO SEE A DOCTOR MANY TIMES YOU'LL SKIP THE DOCTOR BUT IF YOU'RE TOLD WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE YOU MORE FINANCIAL HELP IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS GREAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO THE DOCTOR MORE SO THAT'S THAT'S OF THE COST YOUR MCAT MECHANICS WERE -- LAST I WOULD JUST NOTE IN IN CLOSE AND I LOOK FORWARD YOUR QUESTIONS IS -- I DO THINK THAT -- IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO SAY WHICH IS THE RIGHT. YOU KNOW PIECES TO PUT TOGETHER HERE BUT I DO THINK THE LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR HAVE A RIGHT BY THINKING OF PAIRING PENALTIES AND SUBSIDIES. THE ISSUES OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS NOBEL PRIZE TO TAILORED -- CHICAGO. A KNOWLEDGE MAKES SENSE A KNOWLEDGE OF WORKS -- EVERYONE TO PAY MORE IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PENALTY. ALSO PEOPLE ABOVE THE CLIP ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LEFT THEM OUT AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S A CHALLENGING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS -- THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT MANY PEOPLE. STILL WOULD NOT GET SUBSIDIES. BUT BY HAVING A WORKING INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAT HAS LOWER PREMIUM INCREASES EVEN PEOPLE THAT SUBSIDIES WILL BE ABLE TO BUY AND STILL WILL BE BLIND SO IT BENEFITS EVEN PEOPLE HAVING THE A PENALTY. PEOPLE THE DOCKET SUBSIDIES WILL BE PAYING LOWER PREMIUMS WITHOUT SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE PREMIUMS GOING DOWN FROM HEALTHY RESPECTS. SO WE ARE DONE -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK AT COVER CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LEVY. HI RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELL I I THINK THAT MISTER LEE AND THIS WAS THE DEFINITELY SET THE STAGE FOR THIS DISCUSSION TODAY SO I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME. TO DISCUSS -- THE FACTORS LEADING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL -- BUT VERY VERY SORRY INTERJECT AND HAD A QUESTION IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TO ASK AT AT THE GENERAL THAT PREVIOUSLY SPOKE WITH THAT BE OKAY BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD ADDRESS IF WE CAN JUST TWO QUESTIONS AT THE AFTER OKAY THANK SOMEONE. THINK YOU ALL ACROSS THE STATE. BUT YEAH VERY BRIEFLY -- UNDER THE ACA CALIFORNIA MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN REDUCING THE UNINSURED RATE. AND THEN -- SLOWING THE GROWTH OF PREMIUMS -- AND YOU KNOW IT IN AND WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT I THINK TO TO SORT OF TEASE OUT EXACTLY WHAT FACTORS THAT WOULD BE AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS OF THE MANDATE VERSUS OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. I THINK IT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED. THAT THE LOSS OF THE FEDERAL MANDATE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE RATE OF THE UNINSURED -- IN SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES -- TO REINSTATE THE MANDATE AT THE STATE LEVEL BEGINNING IN -- TWENTY TWENTY THE MANDATE -- WOULD BE MODELED OFF OF THE FEDERAL PENALTY WHICH IS EITHER A FLAT AMOUNT OR A SHARE OF INCOME MOST PEOPLE PAY THE FLAT AMOUNT WHICH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS EQUAL. TO SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS PER ADULT PLAN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER CHILD UP TO A MAXIMUM. OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- WE EXPECTED THE MANDATE WILL GENERATE ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PENALTY REVENUE WHICH WE DEDICATE. TO PROVIDING SUBSIDIES -- IF YOU'RE COVERED CALIFORNIA -- SO RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING -- BOTH FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BUT ALSO THOSE WHO -- HAVE INCOMES ABOVE THE THE CLIFF THAT MISTER LEE DESCRIBED -- THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO MAKE THOSE SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE -- FOR INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN TWO SEND OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND LEVEL -- NOW FOR THOSE BETWEEN TUTORED 450% SUBSIDIES WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THOSE ALREADY AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- BUT AGAIN GOING TO THAT SORT OF CLIFF A FACT -- IN IN IN -- COVER CALIFORNIANS REPORT -- THEY THEY HIGHLIGHT THAT UNSUBSIDIZED INDIVIDUAL MARKET PARTICIPANTS -- PAY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR ON AVERAGE IN PREMIUMS THAN DO SUBSIDIZED INDIVIDUAL MARKET PERSISTENCE -- AND SO AGAIN RECOGNIZING THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FACED BY THIS GROUP -- WE PROPOSE EXTENDING THOSE SUBSIDIES -- TO PEOPLE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA AND WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- ON THE DETAILS OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR US AND I HOPE TO BE HELPFUL TODAY -- WERE ALSO LISTENING TO FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED BASED ON THE DETAILS THAT WE HAD -- WRITTEN IN THE BUDGET SUMMARY -- WE HOPE TO ISSUE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SOON WE LOOK FOR DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE MORE WITH YOU IN THE BUDGET PROCESS -- AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS I CAN AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. RYAN WILL SEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND THIS AFTERNOON I WILL BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE LA AS COMMON AND WE'RE JUST PRESENTED. AND I WILL THEN PRESENT SOME COMMENTS ON SOME -- POSSIBILITIES FOR FUNDING PROPOSALS INTENDED TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. AND ALSO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE FOLLOWING PANEL ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. CONSIDERATIONS I'M ALWAYS SPEAKING TODAY FROM A HAND OUT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO YOU ALL BEGIN ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT -- WITH WITH OUR OFFICES COMMENTS -- TO START OFF WITH ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WELL THE FULL EXTENT. OF THE IMPACT OF A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS UNCERTAIN IT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS THE STATE HAS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT -- AND IN COVERAGE AND TO REDUCE THE COST OF OF COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AS HAS BEEN. MENTIONED THE COVER CALIFORNIA PROJECTIONS AND SHOW THAT A STATE INDIVIDUAL ANDATE COULD RESULT IN. NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL -- PEOPLE ENROLLING IN COVERAGE AND THAT -- ESTATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COULD ALSO LEAD TO A AVERAGE REDUCTION IN MONTHLY PREMIUMS OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS -- PER MONTH FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE THESE ARE RELATIVELY LARGE EFFECTS COMPARED WITH. MOST OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL OPTIONS REPRESENTED IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA REPORT. AND AT THE SAME TIME ESTATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD GENERATE REVENUES FOR THE STATE -- THESE WOULD LIKELY BE OFFSET TO SOME DEGREE BY INCREASE STATE COSTS AND MEDI CAL BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NOT EVERYONE AND THAT'S ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL IS ENROLLED IN IT'S EXPECTED THAT -- WITH THE END OF THE FEDERAL PENALTY -- SOME -- PEOPLE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE WILL WILL LOSE THAT WILL DROP THAT COVERAGE -- AND A STATE MANDATE WOULD ENCOURAGE. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO SEEK OUT AND AND MAINTAIN THAT COVERAGE BUT EVEN WITH THOSE OFFSETTING COSTS AND A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS IS VERY LIKELY -- COST EFFECTIVE -- APPROACH FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER FROM A STATE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- COSTS OUTSIDE THE STATE BUDGET IN PARTICULAR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD RESULT IN SOME INDIVIDUALS APPERSON COVERAGE WHERE THEY ARE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE -- ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THAT COVERAGE -- BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY GENERATE REVENUES FOR THE STATE AT THE EXPENSE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE COVERAGE -- PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DON'T VIEW THE OPTIONS AS AFFORDABLE. IN LIGHT OF THESE COSTS AND SORRY IF I GET TO THAT ON BALANCE AND CONSIDERING THE THE DIFFERENT FACTORS A PLAY WE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. TO AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO ENACT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. BUT IN LIGHT OF THE COST THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WOULD IMPOSE ON SOME HOUSEHOLDS WE DO MAKE WE DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE. AFTER THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT WOULD -- IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. I'M. AS BEEN MENTIONED AT THIS POINT RELATIVELY FEW DETAILS HAVE BEEN RELEASED -- SO FAR ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUBSIDIES -- BUT IF THEY WOULD BE FUNDED FROM ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED TO BE GENERATED BY THE PENALTY. THEY WOULD BE RELATIVELY MODEST -- AND COMPARES THESE WHICH ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVING SAID THEY WOULD -- YOU KNOW EASE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- MAN AND THEREFORE WORTH CONSIDERING -- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SUBSIDIES IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ARRAY OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS INCLUDING THOSE. AT REFERENCE IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA REPORT AND AND DETERMINE WHICH SET OFPOLICIES WOULD BEST A LINE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. AND DESIRES FOR FOR BUDGETARY COMMITMENT -- WITH THAT I WILL MOVE ON TO SOME COMMENTS ABOUT. SOME POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE. AND TO PAY FOR POLICIES INTENDED TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. BEGINNING ON PAGE. FOUR AND THE HAND OUT LIST HAS SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO KEEP IN MIND. FOR USING INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY REVENUES. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE HAS A POLICY GOAL OF ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE A COVERAGE OR CONVERSELY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM GOING WITHOUT COVERAGE. AND AND THIS POLICY GOAL IS AT ODDS WITH A SECONDARY GOAL OF CREATING REVENUES TO PAY FOR FOR SUBSIDIES -- IN OTHER WORDS IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE THE POLICY GOAL THAT WOULD MEAN -- LEADING TO AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AT GOING WITHOUT COVERAGE AND PAYING THE PENALTY BUT THIS THEN WOULD RESULT IN. LESS REVENUE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE SUBSIDIES. ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND WITH AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. IS TIMING AT REVENUES FROM A STATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY -- IF IT WAS MODELED ON THE FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE YEARTHAT IT WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED THROUGH TAX RETURNS. AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO COVER SUBSIDIES BUT ALSO WISH TO MAKE THE SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE PENALTY WHEN TO AFFECT. IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SOME UP FRONT FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO COVER THE FIRST YEAR OF SUBSIDIES. TURNING TO PAGE -- FIVE AND THE HAND OUT -- ANOTHER. POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABILITY POLICIES IS. A RENEWED AT MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION OR MCO TAX PACKAGE. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AND THE STATE CURRENTLY LEVEES ATTACKS ON MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS OR NCOS. THAT ALLOWS THE STATE TO LEVERAGE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AS PART OF THE CURRENT MCO TAX PACKAGE THIS TAX REDUCTIONS TO CERTAIN INSURERS. TAKEN ALL TOGETHER THIS RESULTS IN A NET GENERAL FUND BENEFIT OF ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. THE CURRENT NCO TAX PACKAGE IS GOVERNED BY STATE LAW AND ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVALS. AND IS SCHEDULED TO SUNSET AT THE END OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE MCO TAX PACKAGE AS PART OF HIS BUDGET. HOWEVER RECENT FEDERAL APPROVAL OF SIMILAR INSURANCE INSURANCE TAX -- AT POLICIES AND OTHER STATES AND MEAN THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD APPROVE -- A RENEWAL OF CALIFORNIA'S MCO TAX. IF THE STATE WERE TO RENEW THE MCO TAX PACKAGE. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS WOULD GENERATE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS OF BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND POTENTIALLY AROUND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN LATER YEARS. AND THESE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS FREED UP RESOURCES COULD BE USED TO FIND VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY POLICIES. TURNING TO PAGE SIX TIME WE DISCUSS SOME. CONSIDERATIONS FOR USING A SUGARY DRINKS TAX -- FIRST CONSIDERATION FOR A SUGARY DRINK TAXES THAT SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SUCH ATTACKS WOULD HAVE -- BOTH A POLICY AND A FISCAL GOAL. AT THE POSSIBLE THE SUGARY DRINK TAX WOULD BE TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY BEVERAGES AND POTENTIALLY LEAD TO IMPROVED HEALTH. AND THE FISCAL GOAL WOULD BE TO RAISE REVENUES HE'S [inaudible] AND AS WE NOTED IN A RECENT REPORT -- ON THIS SUBJECT IMPLEMENTING A SUGARY DRINK TAX WOULD -- REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SEVERAL KEY DESIGN DECISIONS -- SOME OF THESE DECISIONS INCLUDE AT WHAT TYPES OF DRINKS TO INCLUDE. IN THE BASE OF THE TAX -- WHETHER THAT TAX BASE WOULD AND BE RELATED TO THE VOLUME OF DRINK OR THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR THAT'S IN. THE DRINK OR SOMETHING ELSE AND WHAT THE TAX RATE ON THIS WOULD BE. AND FINALLY LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY A SUGARY DRINKS FISCAL GOAL OF RAISING REVENUE COULD CONFLICT WITH THE POLICY GOAL. OF REDUCING CONSUMPTION -- A SUGARY BEVERAGE TAX COULD POTENTIALLY DECLINE OVER TIME SIMILAR TO SOME OTHER EXCISE TAXES LIKE THE TOBACCO TAX. AND IN THIS COULD CREATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE TAX AND THE COST OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT. THE TAXES INTENDED TO SUPPORT. ON PAGE. SEVEN WE NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE EXISTING GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS BUT OF COURSE THIS WOULD REQUIRE DIVERTING FUNDS. FROM OTHER ON GOING -- PRIORITIES. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE CHANGES TO INCREASE REVENUES TO THE GENERAL FUND -- AS WE KNOW IT IN THE HAND OUT TO HAVE THE THREE MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE FOR THE GENERAL FUND INCLUDE THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES AND USE TAX. AND THE CORPORATION TAX. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER WOULD BE TO DEPOSIT THE REVENUES FROM ANOTHER REVENUE SOURCE SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL. MANDATE PENALTY OR SUGARY DRINKS TAX INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN USE THE GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THE AFFORDABILITY POLICY. THIS WOULD HAVE AND THE ADVANTAGE. AND AVOIDING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN AND THE THAT THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE REVENUES COMING IN AND THE COSTS OF OF THE POLICY. AND IT WOULD ALSO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE DESIGN OF THE AFFORDABILITY POLICY. LASTLY ON PAGE AIDS -- WE PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF USING POTENTIAL FUTURE SAVINGS FROM INCREASED EFFICIENCY. IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND TO PAY FOR AFFORDABILITY POLICIES. AN AS IS BEEN NOTED IN RECENT YEARS A LEGISLATURE AMONG OTHERS HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING COST. AND EFFICIENCY AND ACCESS IN THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PACKAGE THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED -- TO MULTI YEAR EFFORTS INTENDED TO EXPLORE AND ISSUES RELATED TO THESE CONCERNS THE FIRST IS THE HAVE FUNDING TO PLAN AND DEVELOP A DATABASE THAT WOULD COLLECT INFORMATION ON HEALTHCARE COSTS AND UTILIZATION. AND THE SECOND IS THE CREATION OF A COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHICH IS TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE LGISLATURE WITH. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MORE STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THESE EFFORTS WILL TAKE TIME -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT EFFICIENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AT SOME POINT THE STATE COULD HAVE REDUCE COSTS. AND FOR HEALTH CARE INCLUDING FOR HEALTH PROGRAM. AND THE SAVINGS COULD -- BE USED -- TO FIND A VARIETY OF POLICIES. HOWEVER THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF ANY POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM SUCH EFFICIENCIES ARE. ARE VERY ANSWERED. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS FOR THIS PANEL AND I'D ALSO HAPPY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ALSO NOTE THAT -- I HAVE SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE FROM THE LA -- THEY HAVE MORE DETAILED EXPERTISE AND SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE'VE. REVIEWED AS PART OF THESE COMMENTS AND THEY'RE ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY DETAILED QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THESE -- VERY IMPORTANT PRESENTATIONS AND WILL ALASKA ARE MY COLLEAGUES WERE -- QUESTIONS -- SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU AND THIS WAS FOR THE PREVIOUS GENTLEMEN -- I THINK I HEARD YOU I READ THE THE REPORT AND YOU NOTED THE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT. FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND I JUST WANNA KNOW THERE'S I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO ONE IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DROP IN ENROLLMENT AND THE OUTREACH EFFORTS TO THOSE. COMMUNITIES AND IS THERE ANY PARIS AND DOLLARS SPENT OUT OUT REACH PREVIOUS YEARS TEN NOW. AND THIRD HOW DO WE PLAN TO IMPROVE THOSE EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE QUESTION BUT ABSOLUTELY NO CORRELATION OF CHANGES NOT REACH WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS BEEN VERY INVESTED IN WE DO -- PAID ADS IN LANGUAGE IN KOREAN AND SPANISH IN -- CHINESE -- IN OTHER LANGUAGES WE DO -- MEDIA WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES OUR HYPOTHESIS ON WHY WAS THERE A DROP IN IN LANGUAGE. IS CONCERNS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRAVEL IN THE STATE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO REPORTERS. IN CHINESE TRANSLATED UP A VERY GOOD CHINESE SPEAKER -- YEAH OTHERS SPEAKING IN SPANISH AND AND KOREAN AND WAS QUITE ANSWERING THE THAT. I WAS ASKED RECENTLY ABOUT PUBLIC CHARGE I WAS NEVER ASKED WHAT THE PENALTY -- SO THERE'S NO ZERO CORAL OUR OUTREACH -- BUT THE THE ONE THING WE IDENTIFIED THAT WE ALSO HEARD FROM -- COMMUNITIES. THEY WERE WORKING DOING OUTREACH AND AGENTS WAS THAT CONCERNED -- NOW WHY DID THAT SHOW UP ONLY IN IN LANGUAGE IN OUR DATA ANALYSIS AND NOT FOR INSTANCE -- IN THI -- DIFFERENCE IN LATINO ENROLLMENT DIDN'T SHOW UP THERE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DROP. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT YOU'RE MORE APT TO HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK IN LANGUAGE -- BE MORE CONNECTED TO THE RECENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE INAPPROPRIATELY BEING SCARED OFF FROM GETTING COVERS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC CHARGE ISSUE -- AND SO I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK MORE ANOTHER TIME ABOUT OUR OUT REACH -- INVESTMENTS WE MAKE A LOT OF THE GETS REALLY IMPORTANT -- STAND THAT IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A STATE BASED MARKETPLACE COVER CALIFORNIA IN DOLLARS IN A FULL RANGE OF ADVERTISING COMMUNITY OUT REACH NAVIGATOR AWARDS. IN CONTRAST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH SUPPORTS OUT REACH FOR THIRTY NINE STATES SPENDS TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING -- AND ABOUT THE SAME ON THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM SO WE ARE SPENDING A LOT WE THINK WE'RE SPENDING IT WELL -- WE DID INVEST MORE THIS YEAR A LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE PENALTY REMOVAL -- BUT THAT -- YOU KNOW ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF SPECTRUM OF TARGETS WERE TRYING TO ENROLL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THINK HM [inaudible] ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND HI I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS IF I CAN ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE I GET THE RIGHT RYAN HERE AND SO I BELIEVE IT'S RYAN MILLER -- WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I'M HOPING YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN PENALTY REVENUES. WHEN THOSE WILL BE RECEIVED HOW THE TIMING WITH WHEN SUBSIDIES WOULD BEGIN? AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BRIDGE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE FOR THE INTERMENT TIME. AND THEN I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW THAT UP BY ASKING. ABOUT WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS WORK TO REINTRODUCE -- THE PENALTY WHAT EFFECT THAT -- AND TO OUR BUDGET. THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY MISTER BOWLES AND I WERE FORMERLY COLLEAGUES OF THE CONFUSION OF THE NAMES -- RELIEF WAS EVEN A GREATER PROBLEM THAT -- SO AS I MENTIONED WE'D LIKE -- TO WEPROPOSE BEGINNING THE PENALTY -- WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR OF AN FTP WOULD BE ADMINISTERING THAT -- TAX FILERS WOULD BEGIN -- TO MAKE THOSE PENALTY PAYMENTS -- IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAXES -- FOR FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND SO -- RECOGNIZING THAT SHOULD THE SORT OF TIMING CHALLENGES THERE -- WE DO INTEND TO HAVE -- SOME ONE TIME A SOLUTION WE HAVEN'T WORKED OUT ALL THE DETAILS BUT SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THE SUBSIDIES CAN BE AGAIN -- DESPITE THOSE TIMING CHALLENGES QUESTION -- CONCERNING -- POSSIBLE FEDERAL REINTRODUCTION OF THE MANDATE -- WE ALSO ARE CONTEMPLATING US SOME KIND OF MECHANISM TO HAVE THE STATE MANDATE WORK IN CONCERT WITH A POSSIBLE FUTURE REINTRODUCTION SO. IT -- I THOUGHT THE ONLY -- REALLY SPOKE WELL OF IT OF THE PARADOX OF ACTUALLY WANTING TO GET EVERYONE COVERED. THEREFORE THEN NOT HAVING THE PENALTY REVENUES TO HELP WITH THE SUBSIDIES. BUT IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE AFFORDABILITY PEACE OF THIS WHICH MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE ARE GOING TO NEED BEFORE WORK TALKING ABOUT A PENALTY. WE'RE GOING TO NEED AS MUCH CARROT AND STICK IN THIS EQUATION TO MAKE SURE WERE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SO -- WOULD JUST ENCOURAGED THIS ADMINISTRATION AGAIN TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE MCO TAX. TO SAY THAT WE'VE HAD THIS IN PLACE FOR YEARS AND I MAY PROVIDE THE BRIDGE UNTIL WE CAN RESOLVE MANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES REGARDING THE PENALTY SO. WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DR. THANK YOU FOR WITH -- I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS -- FOR FINANCE FOR MISTER MILLER -- SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT IS -- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF SUBSIDIES AS A PLANE SUPPLY SO WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE GOT THAT ACTUALLY THE BILL FOR THAT AS WELL WORKING -- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE SUBSIDIES ITSELF BECAUSE A FAULT WITH COVER CALIFORNIA TERMS OF THEIR REPORT. FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF WHAT CUT SO YOU HAVE. WHAT YOU PROVIDE WHAT KIND OF LEVEL SUBSIDY PROVIDING FOR THE FOR ARE YOU DOING? SCHERING SUPPORT AS WELL WITH THAT FUND'S ASSETS -- SO I JUST WANT TO GET CLARITY AS FAR AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BECAUSE I SEE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER ON THE COVER CALIFORNIA HOUSES WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO. YEAH AN YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THE THE INTEREST THERE ARE CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THE TIMING OF THIS COVER CALIFORNIA REPORT IS IS REALLY FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S HELPING US. A GREAT DEAL THINK ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE DETAILS TO SHARE TODAY BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THESE WITH YOU IN THE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. OKAY SO -- I JUST MAKE NO TO THE DIFFERENCE IN SCALE -- STUFF FROM THE COVER CALIFORNIA REPORT -- AGAIN YOU KNOW -- SERVICE GOING BACK TO WHAT -- CHEN ARAMBULA SAID WE WANT TO BE SURE ON THE FORTY BILLY SIDE. WE GOT THE IDEA ABOUT A PENALTY WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO BE PART OF MANY PEOPLE TO BE TOGETHER -- I'VE MADE NOTE THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU START OFF THE YEAR HEALTHY DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL AND THE YOU'RE HEALTHY. RIGHT AND SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE COVERAGE THAT DOES BECOME A COST THAT GETS SPREAD OUT TO EVERYBODY ELSE WHO ACTUALLY BOUGHT COVERAGE. SO. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT SO I GET LOOKING MAKING PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY INSURANCE BUT THE THING IS THAT'S INSURANCE OTHERWISE -- I MEAN THAT THAT YOUR YOUR RISK WHETHER YOU'RE YOUNG OR OLD YOU'RE AT RISK OF HAVING HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO ABANDON PEOPLE -- BECAUSE OF THAT -- SO I GUESS THE THE QUESTION -- FOR SLEEPY -- SO IN YOUR PROPOSAL AND SERVE THE OPTION I GUESS THE OPTION ONE WELL OPTION TWO IS THE AD THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE I THINK WE ALL SEEMS LIKE MOST OF US AGREE WITH THAT WE'LL SEE -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE SUBSIDIES -- ARE YOU LOOKING AT NIGHT -- JUST TRYING TO I WAS ALSO LOOKING AT THE GRAPH ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR AND A REPORT WAS SO THIS YEAR'S YOU'RE PROPOSING SUBSIDIES THAT GO BEYOND 6100% OF ARE JUST UP 26100% FPL. CALL FRIENDS ON OKAY. THE STAFF HERE. AT OUR OFFICE RIGHT [inaudible] IS. EVERY CLUB THERE'S A HOLE RIGHT IN. THAT MODELS OF THE SESSION RATHER. IS A DAY TO DAY FOR YOU TO OF THE REPORT FRANK THEN WHEN THE THE REPORT MODEL NUMBER OF DISCRETE OPTIONS. AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS A THIS IS A COMBINATION OF SOME OF THE OPTIONS HERE SO WE HAVEN'T MET THEM ALL TOGETHER THE DEPARTMENT PLANETS LOOKING AT HOW TO BRING THEM TOGETHER SO. AS YOU HEARD FROM A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY'RE LOOKING AT AT ONE INCREASING FINANCIAL HELP FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE FROM. TWO FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED AN INCREASING HELP FOR PEOPLE MAKE FROM FOUR HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED OKAY SO -- IN OUR OPTIONS RUN THROUGH -- YOU'LL SEE OPTIONS -- T. FIVE AND TK SIX ON PAGE FORTY TWO ARE SPECIFIC REAL BID OTHERS WHEN THIS. IS -- OPTIONS OF FORTY SIX HUNDRED THAT WOULD COST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS SUPPORT OPPOSING. ANOTHER PIECE ON THE PRIOR PAGES OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE LESS THAN 40% AND SO IT IT THE COMBINATIONS OF THERE'S THERE'S SHOT SORT OF A TWO BY TWO SQUARE OF OPTIONS. HOW MUCH ARE YOU FUNDING FINANCIAL HELP CITIES THAT PREMIUM TILL PEOPLE GET THEIR COVERAGE? AND IT'S ABOVE AND BELOW. FOUR HUNDRED OR HOW MUCH YOU DOING FOR CULTURE RIGHT EACH OF THESE OFFICE LAYOUT THOSE OFFER THAT'S EXACTLY I THINK. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT PLANTS OF LOOKING AT YEP IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT. YOU KNOW WITH. THE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ISHQ. TARGET TO USE FOR SUBSIDIES -- YEAH THE I MEAN THE THING THAT IT'S IMPORTANT NOTICE BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THOSE -- PEOPLE RIGHT ABOVE THE CLIFF. NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN USE A LOT OF SUBSIDY DOLLARS. BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY UNDER WATER TODAY -- SO BENEFITING -- THE NEW ENROLLMENT OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR SO IS ACTUALLY RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SO. AS OPPOSED TO SPREADING SMALLER NUMBERS ACROSS A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THAT TWO FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO GET COVER -- IT WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE BUT SMALLER DOLLAR AMUNTS ON A PER PERSON BASIS THAT SELF AND AGAIN THAT THAT'S WHAT THE REPORTS TRYING TO LAY OUT THE POLICY OUGHT TO GET FOR YOU RATHER SAY HERE'S THE EXACT RIGHT FOR NOW OKAY I GOT THAT I THINK -- BUT I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO MUCH WE WANT TO WORK WITH I THINK WAS SUGGESTED WE MIGHT LOOK AT ELLIE IS SUGGESTED WE HAD OTHER REVENUE SOURCES ARE. ARE EVEN GENERAL FUND HOW MUCH WE WANT TO PUT IN ESPECIALLY WE'RE GONNA DO AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE I THINK THERE'S ALSO -- I I GET THE IDEA IN TERMS OF WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE WE CAN HELP AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE BELOW FOUR HUNDRED ALREADY HAVE EXISTING SUBSIDIES FEDERAL CREDITS AT CETERA. WE DON'T NEED TO PUT HIS. FOOT AS MUCH PER PERSON RIGHT TO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. ALSO A BIG NOTE THAT THE PEOPLE OVER THE CLIFF RIGHT I MEAN WE MAY HAVE TO SPEND MORE PER PERSON WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE OVER REFORM 2%. OR ESSENTIALLY ELDER LEVEL ELDERLY CDL STUDY I WILL USE THAT ALL OTHER. USEFUL -- THE WHAT ADVANCED YOUTH MATURE ATTENDANCE PERSONALLY TALK AT HAND RIGHT NOW. SAY BUT RIGHT. SO BUT I MEAN IT'S SO PEOPLE BEFORE THEY CAN GET ON TO MEDICARE RIGHT SO I MEAN THE REASON THAT THEY COST A LOT MORE IS BECAUSE WELL. AS BECAUSE THEY ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF GETTING SICK AND THAT'S WHY WE THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH GO OUT COMPARED TO YOUNG NO THAT IT WAS THERE FOR THAT WE JUST ALLOW THAT REALLY RUN IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. SO THE THE CHALLENGE HERE THOSE IT'S ALSO IN MANY WAYS WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING INSURANCE THAT'S THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT RIGHT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE SHORT TERM PLANS IT'S UNDER A WE DON'T MAKE PROMISES WE DON'T KEEP. SO TO ME THAT AND EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE FEWER PEOPLE HELPED PER DOLLAR -- THAT IS A POPULATION I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT FROM WHO HAVE. A VERY LARGE NEEDS BECAUSE BASICALLY THEY'RE FACING THE CLIFF [inaudible] AND TRUE I'D AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING LESS ARE NOT HAVING THEIR AFFORDABILITY ISSUES BUT THEY BUT I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I NOW JUMP UP THAT NINE HUNDRED RIGHT I MEAN SIMILARLY DOUBLING RIGHT FROM WHEN YOU'RE CROSSING THE LINE -- THIS FREEMAN'S AND GIVEN THAT THE HOW HIGH THIS PREMIUMS ARE -- FOR PEOPLE OF THAT AGE BRACKET -- I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THEM RIGHT -- SO BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO BASICALLY SAY WALL BRADY GOT I DON'T GET SICK ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET SICK. BUT I'M GONNA TAKE THE PENALTY AND THEN GOD BLESS ME IF YOU KNOW I A CREEL AT THAT DOES SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS AND I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. ONE I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS THE REALIZE THAT TO YOUR WE WANT TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE OR LOWER INCOME BETTER BUT ZERO REASON FOR THE 6100% -- DUTY WHAT A WHAT A AS OF WHAT WITH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR SOMEONE WHO LIVES AND IT WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER WHO LIVES IN THAT AREA I MEAN I REPRESENTS ACTING METTLE TO BUT I MEAN. WHAT WHAT THE SIX IS AT THE SECOND PERCENT THE RIGHT PLACE WE IS THAT THE RIGHT PLACE RIGHT -- SO WE HAVE TALK ABOUT PREMIUM HELP AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST OF IT. SO -- SO THAT I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO POSE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND LOOK AT SO WHAT IS THE I GUESS WE DO SOME SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS LOOK AT LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT WHAT WHERE THE INFLECTION POINTS ARE RIGHT THIS IS THAT HIGH ENOUGH OR IS THAT WE CREATE A NEW CLASS THAT -- WE'RE GONNA BE STRUGGLING WITH. IF I COULD TALK SEND THESE TWO THINGS IN YOUR THE COMPREHENSIVE MODEL HAS NO CLICK AT THE END PART THAT'S PART OF WHY IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE -- BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOMES RISES AS IT GOES UP BUT IN BACK TO THE QUESTION AN INFLECTION POINT IF YOU'RE THE PERSON OVER THE CLIP IT DOESN'T IF IT'S LIKE A INFLECTION MATTER WHAT. BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DROPS DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO UP THE IN COUNTRY BECAUSE OVER 6100%. GENERALLY PEOPLE MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY HUGE PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME AND I JUST THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THE OTHER TO NOTE IS THAT. IT IS ALSO. AN ISSUE OF WHERE YOU LIVE IN YOUR HEALTHCARE COSTS SO SACRAMENTO LIKE THE BAY AREA IS THERE REALLY PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE FOR THE SAME COVERAGE -- ARE SPENDING EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE A MONTH THAN THE EXACT SAME COVERAGE IN LOS ANGELES AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THAT HAVING A JUST LIKE THIS THAT INCOME BASED. AND BASED ON THE COST OF YOUR HEALTH CARE WHERE YOU LIVE ADJUST. FOR OKAY AND THEN I ONE OTHER QUESTION -- AND IN THE REPORT I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON IT HERE YET -- I JUST MENTIONED REINSURANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT MADE THE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION -- BUT CAN YOU AT THERE LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IF -- WE HAVE -- CAN YOU JUST TOUCH ON THAT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW DOWN. A RESOURCES AS WELL WELL TWO THINGS AT ONE THING I'D GO TO THIS IS WHERE I APPRECIATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE CALLING WE DIDN'T JUST DELIVER IT TO YOU WE DELIVERED IT TO CONGRESS -- AND OF THE CORD A MINISTRATION IN MANY WAYS REINSURANCE I THINK IS -- ECONOMICALLY PHENOMENALLY SOUND INSTRUMENT BUT IT WAS IN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BRINGING IT BACK HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSION AS PART OF BIPARTISAN DISCUSSIONS FOR STABILIZE AN INDIVIDUAL MARKETS ACROSS THE NATION -- DOING IT ON A STATE BASIS WHERE STATES FROM SOME OF THE MONEY SEVEN STATES HAVE DONE THAT -- BUT I THINK. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE THE MATCHES SO TO SPEAK TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS TO MAKE THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD MATCH FUND ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA RESURGENT A PENALTY. AT THE SAME TIME IS A SOUGHT REINSURANCE FUNDS -- FOR REINSURANCE SO I APPRECIATE THAT I IF I WANT TO BE SURE WE KEEP DOWN THE RADAR SCREEN AND ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN OPTION WE SHOULD CONSIDER EXERCISING AT SOME POINT -- SO PERHAPS AT A TIME WHERE -- THERE MAY BE A MORE REASONABLE -- DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL MATCH WOULD BE AND I THINK THAT'S REPORT THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE ALSO IS IS THAT THE DOLLARS WE SPEND ON HEALTHCARE -- JOE ONLY THEIR LOCAL THEY STAY HERE AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT IS DOLLARS EMPLOYEE -- THEN PAY TAXES SO THERE IS AN ECONOMIC. SO WE OF CLEARLY HEALTH CARE IS A COST FOR SOMETHING WE NEED TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. SO SOME OF THE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING IN. ACTUALLY IS SPECIAL WE CAN DRAW THE MORE FEDERAL MONEY AND OF THOSE THROUGH CREDITS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WILL ALSO COME BACK TO OUR OWN ECONOMY HERE -- YEAH IT'S THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH OF HEALTH CARE THAT'S EXPORTER IMPORTED FROM OTHER STATES OR OTHER OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST OF ITS RIGHT HERE SO I WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND TOO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DO THE MONEY HALLETT. CIRCLES AROUND AND ACTUALLY -- SHE BENEFITS CAN BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY TO THANK YOU. HELLO JUST BE PUT ON THAT POINT IT ONE OF THESE YOU'LL SEE IN THE REPORT. IS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE OFFICE OF THE EXPAND COVERAGE EXPAND FEDERAL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ADVANCED PREMIUM TAX CREDIT WHEN YOU GET INCREASED ENROLLMENT. MANY THIS BILLION IN ROLES ARE GETTING FEDERAL. TAX CREDIT SO IT IT DOES HAVE THAT EFFECT IT EVEN FROM US RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN -- FRAZIER. THE THING MISTER OF HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION OF FOR THE MAYBE THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENTALLY -- DECEMBER COMMUNITY IN FISCAL -- OF DISABLED COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE THE OP OFTENTIMES IT -- THERE ARE COMPLETELY -- GARNER BUT HEALTH AS WELL WE'RE FOR AB AND ALL THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT COVERS. YOU KNOW THE IDT CHILDREN OR ADULTS THERE ARE. EACH OF THEIR PARENTS -- I I ACTUALLY IN THIS IS -- BUT A IN THE SCOPE MORE A DH CS AND MEDI CAL IN THOSE RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND WITHIN COVERED CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE THE INCOME STANDARDS ARE ABOVE. A 130% OF POVERTY OFTEN DOESN'T HIT THERE WE DO HAVE A RANGE OF THINGS THAT ARE PER EACH OTHER HEALTHCARE NEEDS DIRECTLY MET BUT IF YOU'RE. ASKING INCREDIBLY GOOD QUESTION IS SORT OF LARGELY OUT OF OUR SCOPE OF OF WEARABLES LIKE IS. THE REASON I ASK IS SOMETIMES THERE ARE. INDIVIDUALS IT DON'T GET DIRECT SERVICES. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE CALLED THE TWEETERS RIGHT. AND SO HAVE WE TAKEN THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT -- POPULATION -- SINGLE PARENT. MAKES TOO MUCH MONEY BUT A LOT OF INVOLVEMENT WITH. OF MEDICALLY FRAGILE -- FOR DUAL DIAGNOSIS. SO I MEAN THERE'S A POPULATION THERE THAT THAT. I THINK HAS BEEN MISSED. WELL I SURE HAVE A POLL OF THE I DON'T THINK WE'RE MISSING POPULATION BUT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT -- WITHIN COVERED CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AND ROLLED PARENTS HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS PART OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS TO HAVE A LOWER. INCOME THRESHOLD FOR MEDI CAL -- FOR CHILDREN THEY DO FOR PARENTS SO WE ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- WORKING. VERY CLOSELY FAMILIES. HAVE ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS MET EVEN THOUGH THERE IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE. DIFFERENT COVERAGE OF KIDS VERSUS PARENTS. AND THESE KIDS. TURN INTO ADULTS AND NEVER LEAVE HOME. IF THEIR KIDS ARE LEAVING HOME THEY ARE THEY ARE I WOULD BET DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS THEIR COVERAGE WOULD CONTINUE AS PERMANENT DISABLED AND UNDER A PUBLIC PROGRAM. NOT UNDER COVER CALIFORNIA'S -- SUBSIDIZE -- HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BUT SO SO THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THE THE BATON GETS PASSED SO TO SPEAK UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME AND IT IN THIS HEARING BECAUSE I WANT TO SOLICIT YOUR INSIGHT ON ON THE ISSUE OF PREVENTION -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY BUT ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF IN AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE IS -- INCREASING AMOUNTS OF DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION -- ONE OF THE LEADING EXAMPLES OF THAT IS -- DIABETES THAT SECONDARY -- TO OBESITY AND AND THAT MANY OTHER NEGATIVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES THAT -- OTHER CAN FOLLOW -- CERTAINLY -- AND AND IN ADDITION TO THAT -- EXTRAORDINARY COST FOR EXAMPLE NO STE WITH DIABETES -- AND OF MISTER WILLS THE I SPOKE ABOUT -- THE POTENTIAL FOR USING REVENUE FROM THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE SHOW A TAX -- THAT'S SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT I MY EARS PERK UP ON BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THAT LEGISLATION FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS AND THAT. THE AUTHOR THIS YEAR AND IN FACT THAT HE DOES TO GENERATE A CONSIDERABLE ABOUT OF REVENUE AND IN IN OUR MODELING. BUT THE EXPENDITURE PLAN IS FOCUSED ON PREVENTION EFFORTS -- AND AND SO IT JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN -- DISCUSS HOW THIS FITS INTO THE OVERALL PLANNING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE A DISEASE YOU PREVENT -- EVERY DISEASE THAT YOU PREVENT LOWERS THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE -- SECTORS IN THE SEC KIRSTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE QUESTION THROUGHOUT THE RESERVE. SO AS WE NOTED I THINK SO WE AT LEAST REPORT IN -- SUGARY DRINK TAXES AND CERTAINLY -- SO AS A SORT OF A FIRST STEP IN THAT SORT OF ACT CHAIN OF CAUSATION THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING -- WOULD BE -- FOR THE TAX TO HAVE SERVED THE BEHAVIORAL AFFECT OF REDUCING -- SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION IN AND WE DO ESTIMATE -- IN THE REPORT AND IN OUR ANALYSIS OF A SIMILAR INITIATIVE -- LAST YEAR THAT -- IT SAYS STATEWIDE TAX OF THE MAGNITUDE UNDER DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE THIS A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT IN THAT REGARD -- THE QUESTION THEN IS -- BASED ON THAT INITIAL RESPONSE GAUGING SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF SUBSEQUENT -- CHANGES IN AND HEALTH SUCH AS THE CHANGE IN IN DIABETES THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND AND CERTAINLY -- OF THAT SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF BEEN DISCUSSED IN CONTEMPLATED I THINK IN OUR WORK WE WEREN'T -- JUDICIARY THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES THAT COULD OCCUR WE WEREN'T IN A POSITION TO TO QUANTIFY THAT AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT IS -- A POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT -- AT TWO CENTS PER OUNCE THE PROJECTED REVENUE -- FROM THE SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAX WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ONE POINT EIGHT TWO TWO BILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY -- THAT'S A CONSIDER THAT HAS POTENTIAL -- FOR SCHOOL NURSES -- FOR OF LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND SO A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM -- WOULD TAKE -- OF THAT NATURE WOULD TAKE CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE ON DIABETES PREVENTION FROM THE LEAST FUNDED STATE IN THE COUNTRY -- ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN TO THE MOST WELL FUNDED A PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. IF YOU SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU INTO CHAIR -- THIS REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION MY FIRST -- STINT ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND GETTING AND COVER CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND IT WAS -- MENTION THAT ABOUT 3% OF THE INCREASE THAT WE SEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND HEALTH CARE NOW COULD BE A TURN REAL -- TO NOT HAVING THE MANDATE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT OKAY AT IN THE MULTI YEAR AFFECTED NOT HAVING APPARENTLY WOULD GO UP THE ONE YEAR AFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS ABOUT HALF OF THE EIGHT POINT 7% INCREASE WAS ABOUT ABOUT 4%. IN ONE YEAR SO WE THINK SOME OF THE PLANS PRICED A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PRIOR YEAR THEY WOULD PRICE MORE FOR NEXT YEAR THE OVERALL ESTIMATES WE SEE NATIONALLY OR THAT -- OVER TWO TO THREE YEARS VISIT ROLES IN THE ATTACK ABOUT 10% -- IMPACT ON PREMIUM OKAY AND WHAT IS THE ABSENT THE OF THE PENALTY WHAT IS ARE THE NATURAL INCREASING COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE FROM NATURAL HIGH I I HAVE TROUBLE TALK ABOUT NATURAL INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS BECAUSE ACTED UP. IS A THE THE GENERALLY THE THE HEALTH CARE COST OF LIVING SO TO SPEAK HAS BEEN ABOUT 526% -- IN COVER CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST THAT'S KIND OF HIS OF SEVERAL FEDERAL POLICY OVER THE LAST YEARS BUT SO YOU SHOULD LOOK AT ABOUT 627% IS WHAT HEALTHCARE CP I HAVE BEEN. OKAY AND AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE WE ONE INCREASE THE POOL OF PEOPLE SUBSCRIBING TO COVER CALIFORNIA NOTABLY HEALTHY PEOPLE WHICH ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE A COVER CALIFORNIA MUCH LESS -- MY DISTRICT IS REALLY DIVERSE I'VE GOT SOME VERY WEALTHY AREAS INDIAN WELLS FRENCH MIRAGE AREA AND I'VE GOT SOME VERY POOR AREAS. THE MECCA AREA -- COACHELLA AREA -- CAN WE TALK ABOUT -- PUTTING IN A A STATE PENALTY IS A BIT MAKE SOME MY CONSTITUENTS RATHER NERVOUS -- I CERTAINLY -- EMPATHIZE WITH THE MATURE PEOPLE THAT ARE FIFTY SIX YEARS OLDER WHICH I AM -- WILL SET UP A FEW THINGS -- THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT CLIFF IS A IS A STEEP CLIFFS YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SENIOR CITIZENS THAT -- YOU KNOW ARE LIVING LONGER -- HEALTHIER -- G. BUT OF THE PLANET THEIR FUNDING IS NOT THAT THEY PUT AWAY FOR RETIREMENT ISN'T MATCHING THE THE LONGEVITY OF THEIR LIVES. SO. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A COVER CALIFORNIA PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT PUT -- ARE. LITTLE PEOPLE TO MAKE LESS MONEY -- AND FINANCIAL PERIL TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GET INSURANCE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PUT OUR SENIOR POPULATIONS -- IN PERIL OF EXHAUSTING THEIR SAVINGS AND HAVING FINANCIAL DEVASTATION -- AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE THAT THE HEALTH ATTRIBUTES OF A OF A SODA TAX -- WILL BE SEEN AND MANY OTHER TAXES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE -- HAVE BEEN VERY REGRESSIVE THAT THE THE LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS ARE ARE REALLY BEARING THE BRUNT -- DISORDER TAX AFFECTING NOTICE ARISE AND GASOLINE TAXES AFFECT ME NO BUT THEY DO AFFECT MY CONSTITUENTS. SO GETTING BACK TO I'M GOING I'M GOING TO APPOINT YOU'RE JUST SECOND BUT RE INSTITUTING A STATE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- AND AND IT WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT THE CLIFF IS NOT GOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THE CLIFF. OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE. IF I COULD AND I THINK YOUR YOU AS A LEGISLATION I GOT A LOOK AT WHAT COMBINATION OF PULSES BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING ONLY RICHER THE PENALTY IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY HELP PEOPLE ABOVE 40% OF POVERTY. FAR MORE THAN WOULD HELP PEOPLE BELOW 40% OF POWERS A BACK TO THE REGRESSIVE SIDE. IF YOU ARE MAKING BELOW 40% OF POVERTY -- AND PREMIUMS DROPPED BY 10% OVER THREE YEARS. YOU PAY THE SAME AMOUNT THE TAX CREDIT JUST GOES DOWN. IF YOUR ABOUT 40% OF POVERTY AND PREMIUMS GO DOWN 10% OVER THREE YEARS YOU GET ALL OF THAT SO TO SPEAK YOU HAVE A HUNDREDS OF THE BENEFIT SO. THAT THE THING IS THAT THE AND I I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- FAMILIES IT'S LIKE YOUR BROCCOLI NO ONE WANTS TO BE TOLD TO ROCK LIKE -- BUT THE PRIME BENEFICIARIES OF A PENALTY ARE ONE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWLEDGE TO GET INSURANCE AND DON'T END UP IN THE HOSPITAL HAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT. TO THE ON SUBS RIGHT PEOPLE THEY'RE PAYING LESS AND PRE BUT THE THE PRIME NON BENEFICIARIES -- SO TO SPEAK FINANCIALLY BACK TO THE THE IT'S A NOT A REGRESSIVE. GRAHAM BUT THEY'RE NOT BENEFITING FROM THIS BECAUSE THEY JUST GET A LOWER TAX RATE. THAT MAKES SENSE IT MAKES SENSE AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE MORE BENEFICIARIES SO WE CAN GET INTO THE SYSTEM THE MORE ABOUT HIM ACTUALLY GETTING IT'S IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. SO THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO MENTION IS THAT -- THERE STILL WILL BE AN IMPACT ON LOWER INCOME PEOPLE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR GENERAL FUND ROUGHLY 50% OF IT IS MADE UP OF 1% OF OUR POPULATION THAT IS THE WELL TO DO -- THE TOP BUT TAX RATE I THINK IN STATE CALIFORNIA KNOWS THIRTEEN POINT 3% WHICH REPRESENTS MAYBE ABOUT -- FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AND ELECTED LA -- TO MAYBE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO OPINE THAT IF WE RAISE THAT THIRTEEN POINT 3%. TO THIRTEEN POINT 43% ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS I GUESS IS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR IF YOU INCREASE IT BY A POINT AND A HALF GOING FROM THIRTEEN POINT. THREE TO THIRTEEN POINT FOUR FIVE IT RAISES A BILLION DOLLARS AND WITH THAT SUFFICE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO ENTERTAIN THESE THINGS TAXES AT THE LOWER LEVEL THAT ARE. WHETHER THEY ARE REGRESSIVE THEY'RE PERCEIVED AS BEING REGRESSIVE. AND SATISFYING THE NEEDS OF MAKING THAT THE COVER CALIFORNIA. WORKABLE HOLE AND SAY FOR EVERYBODY TO FEEL THAT THEY CAN GET INSURANCE WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THEMSELVES. CAROLINE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I'D HAVE. TO GO BACK AND LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE FIGURES THAT YOU REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RAISED. BUT IN TERMS OF INCREASING -- THE RE TAX THERE ARE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO INCREASE THE RATES THERE COULD BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASED EVERY RATE. IF YOU INCREASED EVERY RATE -- BY -- POINT BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THAT SCALES FROM THERE ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD PROPORTIONALLY RAISE ALL OF THE RATES -- TO RAISE A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD REQUIRE RAISING EACH RATE BY 1% OF THAT RATE SO THE BOTTOM RATE IS 1% YOU WOULD RAISE IT TO ONE POINT 001% AND SO FORTH SO THEY ARE ALL TURN AS WAS ELOQUENTLY STATED THOUGH THE HIGHER YOUR INCOME THE LESS OF AN IMPACT. THESE HIGHER -- AMOUNTS ARE ON YOUR BUDGET SO THE WEALTHY ARE YOU ARE THE LESS -- OF IN YOUR TENT -- THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE -- AND THAT'S WHY I I PREFER SPECIFICALLY LOOKED AT THE TOP. INCOME EARNERS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO RAISE THE STATE INCOME TAX -- YOU KNOW PROP -- THIRTY WE DIDN'T SEE A MASS EXODUS OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY THE VERY WEALTHY THE LIKE THE SUNSHINE AND LOVE THE BEACHES AND I'M. WONDERING IF WE LIMITED IT TO THE WE'VE PUSHED A POINT HALF ABOVE. WOULD IT GET AS THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT I HAVE CALCULATED IN MY MIND THAT WOULD COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THAT SPECIFICALLY I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT JUST FOR A POINT OF REFERENCE IF YOU SIMPLY RAISED -- RATES ON THOSE MAKING OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THAT THAT IS GETTING INTO THE UPPER ECHELONS YOU WOULD ONLY NEED TO RAISE THE RATE BY POINT 22% TO GET A BILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] IN REVENUE. IF AT I'LL BE VERY GLAD I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK TO TAX AND REVENUE SIDE. BUT ALMOST BIG TO TWO THINGS ONE BLOCK OF HEALTH COMMITTEE I WANT. TO COVERED CALIFORNIA IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IT'S IT'S REALLY COOL WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEIR ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE THAT BUY DIRECT FROM BLUE SHIELD OR KAISER IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET WITH THOSE SUBSIDIES UP THERE BY OUR BENEFIT DESIGN WE NEGOTIATE OUR PRICES AND DAY BENEFIT THERE THE ABOUT THE FOUR HUNDRED UP ONE NUMBER -- TWO YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT HEALTHIER IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN SOME WAYS WE CARE MORE ABOUT. THAT PERSON MY AGE. NOT BEING SCARED AWAY THE YOUNG PERSON BE LIKE TAKE FOUR TIMES A PREMIUM. AT THE PROBLEM OF HAVING PREMIUMS GOING UP AND HAVING ON SUBSIDIZED PEOPLE DROP ALL. THESE -- OLDER PEOPLE AND I'LL TELL YOU THE THEY'RE GONNA BE OLD PEOPLE THINK I CAN MAKE AND THAT'S ABOUTFORMULA THAT THE FINAL THING. THAT I KNOW IS -- ONE OF SIX CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ONE OF SIX SO A LOT OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS MAY NOT. TO WOULD TO TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET TODAY BUT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT'S A CHANGING MARKET PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOB THERE IN AND OUT ITS AT OUR CENTER. AND HAVING THIS PART OF THE MARKET BE STABLE IS PART OF THE BENEFITS THE ENTIRE COLUMN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANYONE ELSE BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS. OKAY -- I GUESS THE THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE GOING TO THE END IS THAT A LOT OF QUESTIONS A VERY GOOD ANSWER BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF A COUPLE IN ITS FIRST -- HE MAY NEED TO CALL FARM TEAM FOR THIS ON THIS ONE SO I'M CURIOUS -- AND NUMBERS -- WE TALK ABOUT THE MCO TAX WHERE THE MONEY GOES NOW HOW MUCH OF THAT GOES TO MEDI CAL. THIS ROOM WAS THE LA OUT SO THE MCO TAX AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER RESULTS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ON SOME LEVEL THOSE SAVINGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION ACROSS. THE STATE'S BUDGET AND IN THE PAST THERE HAS BEEN A CONNECTION MADE BETWEEN. THE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN MEDICARE FROM THE MCO TAX. AND A RESTORATION OF AND REDUCE SERVICE HOURS IN THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. THAT HAD AN ANYA THE HAS AN ANNUAL COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT BEYOND THAT AND THE MCO TAX REVENUES -- AND THEIR AFFECT ON THE GENERAL FUND THE NET REDUCTION IN IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING OF ONE HALF BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S NOT REALLY ALLOCATED TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACES JUST SPREAD ACROSS THE BUDGET IT ALLOWS THE STATE TO DO -- MORE EXPENDITURES IN THAT AMOUNT. SO THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO MY QUESTION TO MR MILLER. IT'S CLEAR IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THE MCO TAXES NOT BEING CONSIDERED FOR RENEWAL CONSIDERING THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL HERE ACROSS THE GENERAL FUND. ALSO CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT MANDATE MONEY SHOULD IT SHOULD WE PASS A MANDATE WILL BE DELAYED. YOU'RE POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT A TWO BILLION DOLLAR [inaudible] HIT HERE. IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING THE MCO TAX AND AND IF NOT WHY NOT. WELL AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT PART OF THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME WE CONTINUE TO LISTEN FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND IN THE IN THE MAY REVISE WE MAY HAVE A PROPOSAL -- I I BELIEVE TO MISTER WILL THESE POINT OF ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE AT MCO TAXES TO DRIVE DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS IN THOSE DOLLARS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM -- ONE OF THINGS INITIALS WE ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER WAS THE THE IDEA THAT. BECAUSE OF THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF I'LL OF HAVING THE ONLY REVENUE IN A SPECIAL FUND -- THE LA -- SUGGESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE FUNDED OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD. ONE THING I THINK WE WOULD POINT TO IS THAT YOU THEN ALSO HAVE THESE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THE MISTER WILL DELUDE TO WHAT THE MCL TAX THAT IS -- IT'S DIFFICULT IN THE GENERAL FUND TO REALLY SAY WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING USED -- FOR AND AND AND WITH REGARD TO THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD BE SIMILARLY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE PENALTY REVENUES ARE GOING FOR HOW MUCH IS YOU KNOW GOING TO BE USED FOR ONE THING OR ANOTHER ANYWAY -- BUT I I GUESS MY POINT IS IS BEING USED SOMEWHERE SO WE HAVE A WE'RE GONNA HAVE POTENTIAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR LESS IT'S GOING TO BE USED. ADD UP AND POTENTIAL IF WE ARE ABLE -- TO IF WE HAVE THE MANDATE -- MONEY COMING IT'S STILL GONNA THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE A LAG SO THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS HERE. THAT. WE WE ONLY HAVE SO BIG SURPLUS SO -- AND I GUESS FOR ME LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SO SO I GUESS I'M ONE ECHO -- DOCTOR ARAMBULA WE WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR A LOT OF MONEY AND AND ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT THERE'S FEDERAL MONEY OUT THAT WE POTENTIALLY MIGHT LEAVE ON THE TABLE. ANYWAY I KIND OF THAT I WILL AND AND THEN MY FINAL QUICK MY FINAL THING IS NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT MORE OR LESS -- MISTER LEVY I'M WITH WINDS ASKED ABOUT THE COST OF WILL CALL CALL THE COST OF LIVINGBUT THE COST OF A NEW COSTA INCREASES OF HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL. BEING AT 5% ROUGHLY A WHEN YOU CONSIDER INFLATION BEING WELL BELOW THAT. IT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL CON. YOU KNOW COMMENTS WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY AROUND COST CONTAINMENT HERE WE CAN'T THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE UNSUSTAINABLE GOING FORWARD SO ANYWAY I WILL. LEAVE IT AT THAT AT THIS POINT SO AT THIS POINT -- PASSES OVER TO DOCTOR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I LIKE WHEN YOU'RE ON A SOAPBOX. TOM FOR OUR THIRD PANEL WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPLEMENT AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS -- WE WILL HAVE RYAN WELLESLEY AND PETERLEE. THANK YOU AGAIN AROUND WE'LL SEE WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- FOR THIS PANEL I WILL BE PROVIDED SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT SOME -- CONCEPTUAL WAYS THAT IN PARTICULAR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE COULD BE -- PROVIDED -- CONTINUE NINE OF OUR HAND OUT WE HIGHLIGHT AND THREE POTENTIAL CONCEPTS THE FIRST. IS A REFUNDABLE ADVANCE OF ALL TAX CREDIT ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX CREDIT -- JUST TO BRIEFLY RUN THROUGH HOW THIS WOULD WORK AND FOR EXAMPLE COVER CALIFORNIA COULD. ESTIMATE HOW MUCH STATE -- CREDIT A PERSON WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR BEFORE COVERAGE STARTS. AND THEN THE CONSUMER COULD HAVE THE OPTION TO ADVANCE SOME OR ALL OF THAT TO IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THEIR PREMIUMS THAT THEY PAY EVERY MONTH. AND THEN -- AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAXES THEY WOULD. FIND OUT HOW MUCH THEY WERE ULTIMATELY ELIGIBLE FOR IF THEY HAD CREDIT THAT WASN'T ADVANCE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED -- AS A REDUCTION IN THEIR TAX BILL OR REFUND. AND IF -- THEY ACTUALLY WOUND UP BEING ELIGIBLEFOR LESS CREDIT THAN THEY HAD ADVANCED THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TO MAKE A PAYMENT. AS PART OF OUR TAXES TO TRUE THAT UP. ANOTHER CONCEPT IS TO DO A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD NOT BE ADVANCE BOWL. SO IN THIS CASE -- THE INDIVIDUAL BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE ASSISTANCE TO IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUMS UP FRONT BUT WHAT INSTEAD. PAY THE FULL PREMIUM AND WOULD THEN -- BE ABLE TO CLAIM THE CREDIT. AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THEIR FATHER TAXES. A THIRD CONCEPT AND IS SOMETHING THAT IS USED IN SOME OTHER STATES WHICH IS. A UP FRONT SUBSIDY THAT IS FULLY ADVANCED TO INSURERS TO IMMEDIATELY REDUCE MONTHLY PREMIUMS. BUT WOULD NOT BE RECONCILED THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM AT THE END OF THE YEAR SON THIS SINCE IT'S NOT A TAX CREDIT. LIKE THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS. AND THESE THREE CONCEPTS AND WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR IT THE STATE'S ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY APPROACH TO PROGRAM INTEGRITY VERIFYING INFORMATION THAT HOUSEHOLDS PROVIDE IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT ASSISTANCE IS GOING WHERE IT SHOULD. AND ALSO FOR THE LEVEL OF NEW ENROLLMENTS IN COVERAGE THAT THAT THEY MIGHT INDUCE THEN I'LL JUST WALK THROUGH. HOW THESE THREE CONCEPTS COULD BE DIFFERENT ON THOSE DIMENSIONS? FOR THE REFUNDABLE ADVANCE WILL TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD BE MODELED ON A PTC. THIS WOULD CREATE NEW WORKLOAD FOR COVER CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY AS I SAID BEFORE ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE. AND THEN ALLOWING AND CONSUMERS TO ADVANCE THAT TO ENSURE IS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE -- COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKELY ALSO ENGAGE IN ON GOING -- ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNT OF ADVANCED ASSISTANCE -- TO REFLECT CHANGES IN HOUSEHOLD SITUATIONS THIS WOULD BE AND PART. TO LIMIT THE EXTENT CAME IN WITH THEIR TAXES AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- THIS OPTION WILL ALSO CREATE SUBSTANTIAL NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND WHICH WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE -- FOR THE RECONCILIATION PART OF THIS THIS WOULD INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT INTEGRATION AND DATA SHARING WITH OTHER AGENCIES -- FRANCHISE TAX WHERE WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH -- CREDIT WAS ADVANCED. AND INTO WHO AND THEN AND THEN WHAT WOULD NEED TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF OF PROCESSING REFUNDS WERE NECESSARY IN MAKING SURE THAT'S ALL RECONCILED -- FOR PROGRAM INTEGRITY IN VERIFYING INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE -- IT'S LIKELY THAT -- COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE SAME PROCESSES THAT ARE USED FOR THE ADVANCED PLAN TAX CREDIT -- SPECIFICALLY VERIFYING HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION AGAINST ELECTRONIC DATA SOURCES -- AND THOSE SAME PROCESSES COULD BE USED FOR ADJUSTING THE CREDITS THROUGH THE YEAR -- AND THEN AS ITS TAX CREDIT AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE WOULD BE TIED TO THE INCOME THAT'S REPORTED ON TAX FROM SO THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF VERIFICATION. IN TERMS OF NEW ENROLLMENT IN HEALTH COVERAGE -- IT'S LIKELY THAT RECEIVING THE ASSISTANCE UP FRONT AS A AN ADVANCED -- CREDIT WOULD RESULT IN A RELATIVELY GREATER IMPACT ON NEW ROMAN BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACT ON HAVING THOSE LOWER COSTS IMMEDIATELY. FOR THE SECOND CONCEPT A REFUNDABLE NON INVENCIBLE TAX CREDIT. AND THIS WOULD NOT -- NECESSARILY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT NEW WORKERS RECOVER CALIFORNIA. THEY WOULD BE INVOLVED WITH CERTIFYING THAT IN A HOUSEHOLD PURCHASE COVERAGE AND THAT THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CREDIT THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A NEED TO ESTIMATE THINGS NECESSARILY ADVANCE ALTHOUGH. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT AND JUST AS A TO GIVE HOUSEHOLDS -- HEADS UP THAT THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SOMETHING -- BUT IT IT WOULD STILL RESULT IN AB IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS INVOLVED BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE WOULDN'T BE THE NEED TO READ AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT ADVANCED CREDITS BUT THERE IS STILL BE A LOT OF WORKLOAD FOR FTP. THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR -- TO OTHER REFUNDABLE. TAX CREDITS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE HAS A REFUNDABLE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. AND FOR PROGRAM INTEGRITY YOU WOULD HAVE THE VERIFICATION THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM. AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THIS OPTION IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A RELATIVELY MORE LIMITED A FACT ON NEW ENROLLMENT. BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY SEE THAT REDUCTION IN THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR PREMIUMS UP FRONT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY FRONT THAT MONEY PAY THE FULL PREMIUM. IN ANTICIPATION OF RECEIVING A REFUND AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO WE WOULD EXPECT RELATIVELY MORE LIMITED -- CHANGES KNOWN ROLAND. FOR THE FINAL -- CONCEPT AND SIMILAR TO SOMETHING BASED ON THE PTC COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ESTIMATING -- CREDIT AMOUNTS WOULD BE UPDATING -- SIR NOT CREDIT NOT SUBSIDY AMOUNTS WOULD BE. UPDATING SAID THE AMOUNTS THROUGH THE YEAR AND AND A PTZ PROCESSES COULD PROBABLY BE LEVERAGE FOR THAT. BUT THIS WOULD NOT RESULT IN NEW WORKLOAD BOARD AND SINCE THERE WOULD BE NO END OF YEAR RECONCILIATION. AND AS FAR AS PROGRAM INTEGRITY GOES THIS OPTION WOULD LACK THE FINAL RECONCILIATION THROUGH THE INCOME TAX SYSTEM WHICH MEANS THAT. SOME HOUSEHOLDS COULD WIND UP WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE OR A LITTLE BIT LESS ASSISTANCE OVERALL THROUGH THE YEAR THAN THEY WOULD HAVE. IF THERE HAD BEEN THAT FINAL VERIFICATION -- THIS WOULD TAKE ON PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IF THE AMOUNTS OF THE ASSISTANCE WERE WERE LARGE AS OPPOSED TO RELATIVELY SMALL -- AND FINALLY THIS WOULD HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS ON NEW ENROLLMENT AS AND A B. T. C. LIKE OPTION WHERE THE ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED UP FRONT. ULTIMATELY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NEED -- TO AWAY THE TRADE OFFS PRESENTED BY THESE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS. AND AND DETERMINE WHICH OPTION BEST ALIGNS WITH ITS PRIORITIES. AND THAT'S ALL THE COMMENTS I HAVE ON THIS ISSUE. GREAT -- SO. THAT [inaudible] FIRST THE THE REPORT WE PROVIDED OUTLINED IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS A COUPLE THINGS IS TO STATE THE OBVIOUS. THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT POLICY AN OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR IN PARTICULAR -- COVER CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD DEPEND ON THE POLICIES. IN FOR HELP PLANTS [inaudible] THAT SAID. THE PATHWAY TO MAKE THINGS DOABLE TO ACT QUICKLY IS TO BUILD ON EXISTING STRUCTURES UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO THE EXTENT ANY POLICY OPTIONS WERE. DIFFERENT MORE VARIED IT WOULD MULTIPLY DRAMATICALLY BOTH THE COMPLEXITY INVITATIONAL JUST SUCH AS AN OVERALL COMMENT -- I THINK THE REVIEW YOU HEARD I THINK IT'S AGREE WITH VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING NOTED ALSO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE ELEMENTS. IS FIRST -- BUT GIVEN THE VARIOUS TOOLS OUTLINED IN A REPORT OF A COMMON ON EACH [inaudible] PREMIUM SUBSIDIES. THE BIG ISSUE IS A DANCEABLE VERSES REFUNDABLE THE REPORT ENTIRELY LOOKS AT ADVANCE OF ALL. END NOTES -- IN THE REPORT OF LIMITATION IF THE INSTEAD THIS IS WHERE TO MAKE THESE REFUNDABLE DISCOUNT DRAMATICALLY THE ENROLLMENT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR BY ANY ECONOMICS OUT THERE THAT. THE YOU SAY YOU PUT MONEY UP FRONT AND YOU GET IT BACK LATER. THAT WOULD NOT BENEFIT LOWER INCOME PEOPLE AND HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE EVEN THEY WOULD BE LESS APT TO USE IT SO YOU THE WAS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION SIDE -- THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ROBUST VERIFICATION PROCESSES THAT WE COULD CLICK THE SWITCH AND DO THAT FOR ABOUT -- FOUR HUNDRED INCLUDING UPDATES ON CHAINS OF INCOME. PUTTING IN PLACE RECONCILIATION PROCESSES -- WOULD TAKE MORE TIME -- AND WOULD BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OR FOR COVER CALIFORNIA -- ON COST SHARING OF ONE OF THE REASONS. TO SHARE WITH YOU EARLIER THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THE COST SHARING STRUCTURES IS -- IF. SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED COST HEARING WAS BUILT ON EXISTING STRUCTURES. HEALTH PLANS COULD IMPLEMENT IT QUITE QUICKLY -- WHICH MEANS IF YOU SAY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP ADDITIONAL COST SHARING SUPPORT TO TAKE SOMEONE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A SILVER PLAN TO A GOLD PLAN. PRETTY EASY TO DO BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING WE WANT TO GO TO A THING THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW AND HAVE AN ACTUAL REAL VALUE OF EIGHTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. WAY DIFFICULT SO THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURES OF EXPANDING COST SHARING USING EXISTING STRUCTURES -- ON THE PENALTY. THE CLEARLY THERE ARE ISSUES -- EXPORT. THERE'S ALSO ISSUES FOR POLICY MAKERS AND FOR US TO IMPLEMENT. TO THE EXTENT POLICIES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR WHO GETS A PENALTY HOW IT'S ADMINISTERED THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. YOU'LL BE MORE COMPLEX BOTH TO ADMINISTER AND MORE COMPLEX IN THE EVENT. THERE IS A RETURN TO THE FEDERAL PENALTY. SO HAVING THINGS IN SYNC IS BOTH FASTER AND EASIER. AND AGAIN I THINK MANY OF US THINK THERE MAY BE A DAY IN THE NOT DISTANT FUTURE WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REINSTITUTE A FEDERAL PENALTY SO THAT'S AN ISSUE ON THE A PETITION THE PENALTY -- WE SPOKE ABOUT REINSURANCE. IF THE STATE WERE TO PURSUE REINSURANCE WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER -- THAT UNTO ITSELF IS A NOT INSUBSTANTIAL PROJECT -- TO OBTAIN THE FEDERAL OFFSET FUNDING AND IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL REVIEW OF THAT WAIVER PROPOSAL WITH UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO WHAT THAT GOT -- IN TERMS THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES AGAIN THE I NOTED THAT THE TWO THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE MOST IMPACT WOULD BE COVERED CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF BEING ABLE TO BE PRETTY NIMBLE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN TURNING ON ABSOLUTE DIME. ALTER WHAT TIME IS SECOND THE OTHER WOULD BE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- THE OTHER ENTITIES IS HEALTH PLANS THEMSELVES. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT HEALTH PLANS. ARE ACTUALLY. STARTING PLANNING. SO HEALTH PLENTY TO BE GIVEN SOME CERTAINTY -- IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO DEVELOP THEIR PRICES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY NEED INSOFAR AS POLICIES WOULD. BE PUT IN PLACE TO AFFECT THEM FOR THE NEXT. PLAN YEAR OF THEY NEED THAT -- BY SUMMER AND WE COULD TALK MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC TIME IN THE OTHER ENTITY THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES MEDICAL. BUT VERY IMPORTANT NOTE THAT ALL OF OUR ENROLLMENT PROCESSES ARE UNDER SOMETHING CALLED CAL HERE'S SOME OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH. STERN YOU ARE FAMILIAR GILLARD ABOUT CAL HERE'S PART OF HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT ITS THE THE ON THE SYSTEM BY WHICH PEOPLE APPLY FOR FINANCIAL HELP. WHEN WE PEOPLE PEOPLE COME TO OUR DOOR THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL OR COVER CALIFORNIA'S SUBS OR NOT? IT'S A COMMON SYSTEM WE SHARE WITH -- DHS FOR MEDICAL -- IF WE ARE GOING TO NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS IN OUR WORK PLAN. WE THINK WE CAN DO IT -- BUT IT WOULD AFFECT PRIORITIES THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THAT WOULD AFFECT. THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES MEDI CAL AND THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT TO THE OTHER IMPACTS ON TIMING OF LIMITATION. AS A STATE WE'VE SHOWN WE CAN BE NIMBLE MOVE FAST BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T RIPPLE EFFECTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES DR PAM. ACTUALLY DID HAVE A QUESTION WELL DIFFERENT AND WHAT BOTH OF YOU PERCENT ABOUT -- SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S COME UP IN A CA FROM NATION NATIONALLY IS THE FAMILY GLITCH. RIGHT. DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF OUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION THAT -- THINGS THAT WE MIGHT DO TO TRY TO A DRESS THAT I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT PROVIDING SOME OF THESE SO FORCE -- OF COURSE SO THE PRICE TAG OF THAT OF COURSE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS BUT NO WORDS WERE HERE TRYING TO FIGURE HOW TO MAKE THINGS AFFORDABLE WE HAVE PEOPLE CAUGHT. IN THE FAMILY GLITCH THAT HAPPENED WITH THE NATIONAL EASE THE OVERALL ACA. SO MISTER THEM FOR NOW MY GUESS IS IN THE AUDIENCE. 17% OF PEOPLE NO THE GLITCH WELL THE OTHERS KNOW WHAT SORT OF OR DON'T KNOW WHAT -- JUST TO REMIND YOU ALL WHAT THE FAMILY GLITCH IS. IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BAKED INTO THE LAW. THERE'S INCOME STANDARD A WHEN YOU GET FINANCIAL HELP. HOWEVER THOSE INCOME STANDARDS HAVE A GLITCH RELATIVE TO IF ONE MEMBER OF A FAMILY HAS EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE THAT'S AFFORDABLE. THE STANDARD FOR DETERMINING HOW MUCH OF A SUBSIDY THEY'D GET ISN'T BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND ALL THE WHOLE FAMILY SO IT'S A IT IS A GLITCH IN THE LAW -- WE DID NOT MODEL THOSE AYE WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE END IS TO THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS GIVEN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHAT COULD WE DO IN CALIFORNIA. THE GLITCHES BAKED INTO THE ACA IS A WE CAN FALL THE TALK THE MORE OFFLINE AND LOOK AT BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS RUNNING THE GOVERNOR. SAID IN HIS LETTER TO CONGRESS IN DAY ONE IN OFFICE TO SAY. GET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER SO TO SPEAK. FIX THINGS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INCLUDING THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA THE FAMILY WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE. THANK YOU WELL CERTAINLY -- IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BAKED IN A NATIONAL I HOPE THERE'S FEDERAL ACTION ON THIS -- I'M NOT TERRIBLY OPTIMISTIC AT THE UNFORTUNATELY -- BUT I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE TO AT LEAST MITIGATE SOME OF THAT -- AS WERE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY HERE IN OUR STATE. BUT I AGREE ULTIMATELY WE CAN'T REALLY FIX IT HERE SB SIX FEDERALLY. IN IN SO FAR AS CALIFORNIA PROVIDES RICHER SUBSIDIES AT ANY LEVEL UP PEOPLE THAT ARE OTHERWISE AFFECT THE LET'S HAVE. MORE SUBSIDIES TO HELP SO TO SPEAK BUT IT'S STILL THE GLITZ DOESN'T GO AWAY IT'S JUST AMELIORATED SOME. THANK YOU OTHER COLLEAGUES. SEEING NONE I'D LIKE TO DRAW SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT I THINK YOU'VE STATED BUT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE -- CLEAR ON YOU BELIEVE IN BUILDING UPON THE EXISTING STRUCTURES OF THE ACA. AND THAT A REFUNDABLE ADVANCE BOWL TAX CREDIT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING TO KEEP PREMIUMS DOWN THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DIRECTION THAT THE COMING CALIFORNIANS. BUT YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE'S RELATIVE PRIORITIES FOR COMPLEXITY VERSES -- THE IMPACT ON ENROLLMENT VERSES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED AND THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. ARE STRONGER OR WEAKER ON THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS IF IF YOU WANT TO EMPHASIZE -- INCREASED ENROLLMENT THAN IT DOES APPEAR THAT IT WOULD BE CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE UP FRONT AS AN MISTER LEE MENTIONED -- ON THE OTHER HAND -- YOU KNOW TRYING THINGS UP THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM COULD POTENTIALLY -- PROVIDE SOME MARGINAL INCREASED PROGRAM INTEGRITY -- BUT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDITS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHETHER THAT SORT OF ADJUSTMENT IS IS WORTH IT. IN MAYBE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO SAY WE CAN'T GET INTO THE SPECIFICS OF EACH OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT -- US ON THE DíAS MAY BE OFFERING -- CO AUTHORING. BUT TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT A DOLLAR FIGURE IS NEEDED SO THAT WE CAN THEN WORK BACKWARDS TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF A SUBSIDY WE CAN PROVIDE. HOW MUCH OF A CARROT THERE IS AVAILABLE? IS NOT INHERENTLY DETERMINED BY WHAT TYPE OF PENALTY WE HAVE BUT RATHER WHAT WE WANT TO SEND THAT GOAL OUT THE FIRST YEAR. AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN HAVE THAT. DISCUSSION IN ADVANCE OF THE MAY REVISE WHICH IS COMING SO THAT WE CAN -- MAKE SURE WERE -- SUBSIDIES WE CAN. PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET. AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT 60% -- CPI GROWTH WITHIN HEALTH CARE. EIGHT STRUGGLED TO FEEL LIKE ENDS ARE MEETING WHEN IT BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER EACH YEAR TO MEET THE EXPENSES OF HEALTH CARE. AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AS THE LEGISLATURE HOW TO BEND THE COST CURVE -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAS GONE UNSAID THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION TODAY WAS -- THE PROPOSAL REGARDING PHARMACEUTICALS AND THE NEED TO HELP. TO NEGOTIATE -- WITH A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY BENDING THAT COST CURVE SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AND THANK THIS PANEL FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ON IMPLEMENTATION. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WAS A THANK YOU TO ALL OUR PANELISTS TODAY IT'S BEEN -- IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING -- VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR US AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE INTO PUBLIC COMMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE SO WE'LL JUST HAVE YOU LINE UP AT THE MICROPHONE AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND WILL WITH CHIP. BUT YOU GO AHEAD ALSO OR EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU THANK YOU AT DR WOULD I I JUST -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR THE PRESENTATION -- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE WE ARE LOOKING AT TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST EXPENDITURES WE SPEND IS ON CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT'S ABOUT WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN. BETTER INCENTIVIZE CARE OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS FOR EXAMPLE AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS ARE FOCUSED ON A BETTER MANAGEMENT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE UP REALLY ABOUT DELIVERY REFORMS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT AND THIS ONE OF COURSE WORK WITH THAT. SIMPLY COLLEAGUES AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF TARGETING DATA SOURCES OF EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING -- CARE DELIVERY SO -- I THINK THEY'LL CERTAINLY THIS HIGHLIGHTS ON SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF MAKING CARE AFFORDABLE CERTAINLY WE WANNA TRY PRESS THE COST SIDE AS WELL. AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS TIME WILL WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT -- WILL ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONFINE YOUR COMMENTS TO THE HEARING INFORMATION TODAY. AND WE'VE ASKED THAT THE COMMENTS BEING LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF OF MR DEAL FOUNTAIN. WE'VE -- BY PRETTY LISA JUST ANNOUNCE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT WE REPRESENT AND WE LOOK FOR TO COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS ALLISON HOUSTON WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CDF BUT ALSO ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION WHICH INCLUDES -- UNITED WAYS CHILDREN NOW THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP AND THE CHILDREN'S COVERAGE AND HEALTH INITIATIVES -- AND WE WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ABOUT FORD AFFORDABILITY AND PARTICULARLY WANTED TO THANK -- DOCTOR PAN FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF THE FAMILY GLITCH -- AND OF COURSE WE TO HOPE THERE WILL BE A NATIONAL FIX AND HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS THAT FOR SOME TIME BUT WE DON'T SEE IT. HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THE CHILDREN WHO FALL INTO THE FAMILY GLITCH NOT BE DOUBLY PENALIZED BY ANY -- BY ANY CALIFORNIA SOLUTION THAT'S DEVELOPED THIS YEAR OR IN OR IN FUTURE YEARS -- I THINK CATEGORICALLY EXCLUDING THEM BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES WOULD LEAVE THEM DOUBLY PENALIZED AND IT FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF A HE IS APPROVED THIS YEAR. WE ASK THAT PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THE GLITCH BECAUSE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT SUBSIDY WHICH WOULD HELP THEM WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING OFF IN PAYING ON MULTIPLE PREMIUMS IN MOST FAMILIES -- AND WE DID APPROACH THE AFFORDABILITY -- WORKGROUP TO ASK THEM TO LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY FROM A PREMIUM STACKING PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU LOOK AT ALL THE VARIOUS PREMIUMS IN A HOUSEHOLD -- TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD BURDEN WE THINK THAT'S A MUCH FAIRER WAY AND WE DID IT IT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS OTHER FOLKS BE ON THOSE WHO FALL INTO THE GLITCH -- WITH THEIR AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MODEL THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A ANOTHER WAY LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES WHO ARE DEALING WITH THAT EMPLOYEE PREMIUM CHILD'S PREMIUM SPOUSES PREMIUM -- AREN'T -- UNFAIRLY EXCLUDED AND I THINK YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON M. J. D. S. ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WORKING FOR FOR DOUBLE AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WERE PLEASE ARE NOT TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS AND ALSO THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO PARTIALLY FUND THE SUCH AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS ALTHOUGH WE WE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT REVENUE SOURCE IS A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATIONS TO SEE WHAT THE PROPER SOURCES OF FUNDING AREN'T THERE ARE. AS MENTIONED BEFORE AFFORDABILITY REMAINS TO BE A TOP CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIANS THOSE WITH INSURANCE AND THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE -- MANY OF THOSE THAT HAVE INSURANCE STILL CANNOT AFFORD THE INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE DUE TO FOOD COST RENT BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND ANY OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. AND WE KNOW THAT THE REMAINING UNINSURED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE UNINSURED EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR A FEDERAL SUBSIDIES TO HELP AFFORD COVER HELPS THOSE WITH COVERAGE MOVE INTO BETTER COVERAGE AND THOSE WITHOUT COVERAGE INTO NEW COVERAGE SO WE WOULD. EMPHASIZE LOOKING AT OPTIONS THAT WOULD DO ODD BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AND THEN LASTLY OUR GOAL CONTINUES TO BE TO SOME WITHOUT AND CAP -- WHAT INDIVIDUALS PAY 2% OF THEIR INCOME BASED? A SLIDING SCALE AND TARGETING FINANCIAL HELP TO THE LOWEST OF THOSE WITH -- ESPECIALLY THOSE BELOW FOUR HUNDRED AND 210050% OF F. P. ALL AND ALSO HELPING THOSE RIGHT ABOVE THAT INCOME CLIP. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] WE GOOD AFTERNOON UNTIL FOUNTAIN WITH AN ACTING VERSE HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA -- THANK YOU SENATORS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND DOCTOR WOULD FOR GIVE ME THE EXTRA A FEW MINUTES -- I AM WANTING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT -- WHO WE ARE A -- HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORTERS. OF WE ALSO -- IF THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA IS ANGRY ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD -- WE JUST HAD A POLL RELEASED UNIONS. ARE WILLING TO PAY INCREASED TAXES FOR SINGLE PAYER. ON THE SECOND POLE IS 51% CALIFORNIANS WANT TO DUMP PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR SINGLE PAYER -- THIS JUST GIVES YOU AN INDICATION HOW ANGRY PEOPLE ARE I'M GOING BACK TO THE FORD ABILITY HERE -- I'M GLAD THAT UNDER INSURED WAS TALKED ABOUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TALKED ABOUT JUST AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INSURED -- I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP RECENTLY -- ABOUT ALMOST HALF THE POPULATION IF THEY GET A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL -- THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT OR AT LEAST THEY ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO AFFORD SUCH A BILL -- IT'S IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM THE NUMBERS THAT THEY HAD IN ARE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT CORRECT -- I BELIEVE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY I LAST SAW. IT AS FAR AS AFFORDABILITY WITH -- PREMIUMS AND WE HAVE -- TO I THINK LAW GETS LOST. AS FAR AS WHAT PEOPLE -- PAY -- I BELIEVE THAT I EMPLOYER INSURERS -- TO PEOPLE ARE PAYING ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON AVERAGE ON THE ON THE HIGH END -- IT IS -- AND THAT IS GROWING AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- THINGS ABOUT YEAH 8% 5% INCREASES IN PREMIUMS -- THAT'S NOT GETTING BETTER -- IF YEAR EVEN IF -- EVEN IF INFLATION IS 3% PEOPLE SALARIES DON'T EVEN GO UP 3% A YEAR SO THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD THAT IT'S IT'S EVEN WORSE -- I I JUST ONE TOUCH ON PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PRIVATE INSURANCE AND HAVING BETTER CHOICES THE NETWORKS ARE SMALL AND IN FACT WHAT WE JUST SAW WAS SUTTER -- THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THEIR NETWORKS -- TO I BELIEVE IT'S BLUESHIELD IN MY CORRECT TONIGHT ANYWAY -- SO THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF CUSTOMERS WE CAN'T EVEN GET TO THEIR DOCTORS THROUGH THAT -- SF GENERAL SECRETARY GUESTS HAVE GENERALLY MIGHT OF HEARD ABOUT THAT -- BILLION PATIENTS BALANCE BILLING AND HE'S -- ON THE HOOK FOR NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M SO HE'S INSURED AND THAT'S WITH INSURANCE. SO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE INSURANCE DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD -- HOSPITAL ANYMORE -- NOW WITH THE MANDATE IF YOU'RE GOING TO MANDATE SUCH A THING AND I BELIEVE THE THE IS IS IT THE BENEFIT WAS LIKE TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS -- IS THAT IF WE REINSTATE A MANDATE WELL THAT'S RIDICULOUS WITH GIVE YOU JUST SAW THE THE GRAPHICS WITH WHERE THEY ARE YOU KNOW ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. WAS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. ON THAT AND ASSIST THE PREMIUM THAT'S THAT DOESN'T COUNT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR DEDUCTIBLES ARE OR THEIR CO PAYS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS IS NOTHING. IF YOU TRY -- TO IF YOU TRY TO REINSTATE THE MANDATE -- WILL OPPOSE IT 1100% AT THIS POINT WE NEED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS YOU CAN MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. ON FOR THE REST OF THE PEOPLE HERE. REINSURANCE -- NOW IT'S ACTUALLY PER BUT IS FAR AS A GIVEN THAT TO PRIVATE INSURANCE -- WE BELIEVE THAT'S A SUBSIDY THAT ON THAT WE WILL FIGHT AS WELL IT SHOULD ONLY GO TO PUBLIC -- INSURANCE ON IT OTHERWISE THEY'RE SOCIALIZING THEIR LOSSES AND THE PROFITS OF WE SEEM KAISER. AT LEAST A COUPLE YEARS AGO HAD A THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT -- SO I YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUBSIDIZING THAT THANK YOU YOU'RE SUBSIDIZING THAT. ARE THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WHY WHY ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THE PROFITS -- AND LASTLY THE COUNCIL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS NOW I WAS WALKING AROUND DELIVERING. A COUPLE OF FLYERS -- TO EVERYBODY -- SO. I I MIGHT HAVE MISSED WHERE -- GAVIN NEWSOM I DON'T THINK HE WAS HE WAS HE NOW. OKAY GREAT GREAT -- BECAUSE THEN WE CAN START TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- TO START RESEARCHING -- BETTER METHODS OF RATHER THAN JUST DUMPING MONEY INTO PRIVATE INSURANCE AND NOT CAN YOU BENEFITS SO. THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLER ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN WORK GROUP AND SO I DO WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON A COUPLE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED IN THEIR FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIFFS IN HERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WESTERN. CENTER ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT IS THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL CLIFF AND THAT'S THE ONE WHEN YOU MOVE FROM MEDICAID TO COVER CALIFORNIA -- GOING FROM ABSOLUTELY FREE COVERAGE TO COVERAGE THAT HAS PREMIUM COSTS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE LOW AND HAS COME. OUT OF POCKET COSTS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE LOW IT'S STILL VERY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN DEEP POVERTY FOR YEARS. AND THEN END UP FINALLY GETTING A PAYCHECK THAT PUTS THEM OVER THE MEDI CAL LIMIT -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNMET NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF DEBT YOU HAVE A LOT OF APPLIANCES OUR CARS ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT -- SO WE WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE ANY PROPOSAL TO ALSO INCLUDE PEOPLE BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- WHEN WE WORKED ON THE AFFORDABILITY WORK GROUP WE WERE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE MODELING THAT WENT INTO THIS AND SOME OF THE GOOD NEWS AS WAS REFERRED TO HERE IS THAT -- IT IS CHEAPER TO HELP THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- AND ALSO THE TAKE UP RATE IS A LOT HIGHER WE'RE GETTING OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ENTERING THE MARKET BASED ON SOME OF THE MODELING AT THESE LOWER INCOME LEVELS COMPARED TO MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS HIGHER INCOME LEVELS. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BE PROPOSED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE AT LOWER INCOME LEVELS ARE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF WHO IS PAYING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY AND HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS. THAN 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE A REVERSE ROBIN HOOD SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TAKING MONEY FROM LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE FOR HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE POLICIES HELPING UP AND DOWN THE INCOME SCALE BUT WE DON'T WANT THESE PEOPLE LEFT OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS QUAD COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ON A HOUSE ABOUT I'M WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA MOSTLY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION. I WANNA LINE MY COMMENTS SO THAT I DON'T TAKE SO MUCH TIME WITH MY COLLEAGUES WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND -- AND JUST WANT TO RAISE AGAIN THE ISSUE THE FAMILY GLITCH -- IN PARTICULAR -- WHAT WE KNOW AS RAISE MY DOCTOR PAN -- WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS -- ISSUE IS AFFECTING PREMIUMS FOR CHILDREN'S AND AND SPOUSES AND THE FINANCIAL STRESSES PLACED ON HOW PLACES ON HOUSEHOLDS THE FAMILY WHICH MEANS EITHER CHILDREN AND SPOUSES MUCH PAY MUST PAY MUCH MORE IN THEIR PREMIUMS -- OR WITHOUT SUBSIDIES OR ALL TOGETHER -- AND REALLY WE KNOW THAT BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS ARE NOT IN KEEPING WITH OUR STATES ENSURE -- COMMITMENTS TO COVERAGE AND AFFORDABILITY WE URGE THE FAMILY GOOD SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE STATE'S AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE SOLUTIONS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU TEARS IN MEMBERS LINDA TO NARROW ITS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK -- WE WANNA LINER COMMENTS WITH THOSE MADE BY WESTERN CENTER AS WELL AS HEALTH ACCESS WE WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF AFFORDABILITY FOR HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES -- NAMELY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND SO WITH THAT SAID YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT SUBSIDIES ON CONTINUE TO BE INSUFFICIENT FOR SOME OF THE MOST NEED IN. MOST NEED CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND WHO DESERVE GREATER ASSISTANCE SO AS TO NOT FOR GO THEIR HEALTHCARE. AND RESORT TO YOUR SERVICES AS A PRIMARY CARE. THERE'S BEEN A DIP IN COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLMENT FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC HOW -- ARE NOT AND ROLLED -- SO FROM C. PENS PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE STATE TO REALLY INVEST IN COMMUNITY BASE NAVIGATORS WHO CAN HELP PEOPLE GET INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR THE HARDEST TO REACH. HOW THE LARGEST LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND THESE FOLKS HAVE TRUST IN THE COMMUNITIES AND CAN CONTINUE TO DISPEL ANY MISINFORMATION -- AND ATTACKS ON ON HEALTH CARE -- BY THE FEDERAL MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INFORMATIVE HEARING TODAY -- AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO WORK COLLECTIVELY ON WAYS -- TO MAKER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE -- OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BOLD AGENDA AND HEALTH CARE SPACES YEAR AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ON DISCUSSING THE ISSUE OF MARKET STABILIZATION THIS YEAR -- THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S AGENDA THROUGH THE CORRESPONDING -- YOU KNOW LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED -- WE JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WE STAND READY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE -- TO A PROTECTED SIGNIFICANT GAINS THAT WE'VE MADE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN STABILIZE OUR MARKET -- WITHOUT A STABLE FOR FOUNDATION -- WE SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENACT A STATE BASED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND CORRESPONDING ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS -- AS A PURCHASE COVERAGE -- AS EARLY ADOPTERS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITELY UNIQUELY POSITIONS TOO YOU KNOW ACHIEVE A SYSTEM THAT CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE SO -- WE JUST WANNA BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING TODAY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THERESA START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A ALSO WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING AND WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS THAT WERE DISCUSSED TODAY INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND WE'VE APPRECIATED HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOU OVER THE LAST YEAR ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THAT MARKET STABILIZATION IS. A CONCRETE STEPS TO HELP KEEP PREMIUMS DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR TOOK A NUMBER OF STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND THOSE EFFORTS HAVE LAID THE GROUNDWORK AND THESE PROPOSALS ARE THE VERY CRITICAL NEXT STEP AND WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR HIS TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC WE ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO COVER CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN WORK GROUP. FOR THE AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS REPORT THEY PRESENTED HERE TODAY IT'S AT A VERY GOOD ANALYSIS AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE OPTIONS AS WELL AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN BRING REAL MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL HELP TO CONSUMERS. AS DISCUSSED THERE ARE STILL MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT WITH THESE VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES DISCUSSED HERE TODAY WE BELIEVE WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND AFFORDABILITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH COVER CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS MITCHELL COVERED IT WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA PROUD MEMBERS OF THE CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COALITION WHICH HAS BEEN CALLING. FOR IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY AND COVERED CALIFORNIA FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AS ONE OF THE MAIN STRATEGIES FOR GETTING US TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH ADDRESSING COSCO SEEMS THAT CAME UP IN TODAY'S HEARING -- DOCTOR CAN SAID EARLIER THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE PROMISES THAT WE CAN'T KEEP AS A STATE AND WE AGREE WE THINK THAT ONE OF THE PROMISES THAT'S NOT BEING KEPT IS. TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING ASKED TO CAN GET COVERAGE IN THE PAY FOR IT EVERY MONTH -- BUT THEN THEY FIND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT COVERAGE DOESN'T TAKE THEM ALL THE WAY THERE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO ACTUALLY USE THAT THAT COVERAGE -- WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT A STUDY THAT CAME OUT -- VERY RECENTLY WHICH TRYING TO REPLICATE SOME OF THE STUDIES HELP. LEAD TO THE ACA FOUND THAT MEDICAL BANKRUPTCIES REMAINED ALMOST UNCHANGED PRE IMPOSED ACA AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MIDDLE CLASS LARGELY BECAUSE LOWER INCOME FOLKS QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL ARE LIKELY NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING -- TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND SO WE KNOW THAT COSTS ARE STILL A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THIS IS EVEN IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID OBVIOUSLY -- MISTER LEE MENTIONS THE VALUE OF COVERAGE IN THE DIFFERENTIAL IN WAY INDIVIDUALS WILL PAY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN THIS GOES TO THE UNDERLYING COST STRUCTURE AND SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED TO WORK ON OUTSIDE OF HERE WE CAN CONTINUE TO POUR MONEY INTO SUBSIDIES BUT IF WE DON'T CONTAIN THE COSTS OF THE UNDERLYING COVERAGE THAT THEY'RE GETTING. IT'S GOING TO BE UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN AND TO THAT POINT -- WE AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS TODAY THAT AFFORDABILITY SO FROM STARTING WITH THOSE WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD IT AT THE LOWER LEVELS OF INCOME BUT YES DEFINITELY GOING UP 25100% 6100% EVENTUALLY. AND WE NEED THE MANAGED CARE TAX TO BE RENEWED SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THANK YOU. RAINY X. CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY RIGHTS -- I AGREE ALLOWING MISTER FOUNTAIN SAID OVER THERE. AND HERE'S HERE'S A COUPLE STORIES FOR YOU I'VE UP MY FRIEND HAS. NO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. HE SAID. BECAUSE OF HIS PRE EXISTING CONDITION HAS HEALTH CARE SO MUCH THAT HE'S WILLING TO TAKE THE PENALTY. HE'LL TAKE THE PENALTY AND YOU'LL GET USE DRUGS FROM WHEREVER HE CAN GET THEM FROM. THE SECOND STORY IS MY PARTNER WAS CAUGHT IN A REAL GAP BECAUSE HE LOST HIS JOB AND HE LOST HIS HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND HE DIDN'T GO TO ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN FACT YOU DIDN'T GET ANY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE NOW HE GETS THIS LETTER AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. NGUYEN WAS THE PENALTY. ELIMINATED WASN'T ELIMINATED AND IF IT'S NOT HOW COME THEY HAVEN'T SENT HIM A BILL YET. SO HERE WE ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA THEY SEND ME A LETTER GO YOU KNOW WHAT USING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS OFF YOUR TAXES. HE'S GOING. NOBODY SENT ME A LETTER THAT I NEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THIS IS NOT RIGHT WE NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP IF EVERYBODY OUT HERE FOR ME I WANT SINGLE PAYER. THAT'S THE ANSWER COLORS IS SEAMLESS EVERYTHING WORKS BUT FOR NOW SINCE WE HAVE THIS ISSUE WE UP -- TO MIGHT TO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW ARE NOT GOING TO GET COVERAGE. NEVER GOING TO GET COVERAGE BECAUSE ONE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND TWO BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE EXISTING CONDITION YOU NEED TO FIX THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN LAYING ON HAVE A THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS IN A STATE CREATED PROGRAM OF THE THIRTY FIVE MOST RURAL COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA.
