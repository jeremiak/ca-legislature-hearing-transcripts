IT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND IT

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.876

THING THAT COULD HAPPEN OUT

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.011
THERE THAT'S WHY PART OF THE

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.446
BILL IS TO ASK EACH TRANSIT

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.448

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.228
APPROPRIATELY IT'S NOT MEANT

THAT HAVE SUNSET AND ALSO WE

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.667
THINK THAT THE PERSON ON BOARD

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.577
OF SAFETY. FOR NOT ONLY THE

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.179

DEAL WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE BUT

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.937
WE WE JUST FELT THAT THIS WAS

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.572
THE PROPER WAY TO GO.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.307
MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D ALSO JUST

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:56.275
ADD TO THAT THAT.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.210
WHAT THE IN THE BILL IT IT

00:17:58.277 --> 00:17:59.945
DEFINES FULLY AUTOMATED VEHICLE

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.346
AND THESE VEHICLES WILL NOT HAVE

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:04.183
ANY CONTROLS FOR A LICENSED

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.117
DRIVER TO OPERATE?

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.685
SO.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:07.519
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:08.854
AUTOMATED VEHICLE THERE ARE

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:09.721
WHAT'S THAT MEAN.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:13.125
LIKE THERE'S STAGE ONE TWO THREE

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.828
FOUR AND FIVE YOU KNOW IT'S UP.

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.362
THEY GET TO FIVE IT DOESN'T HAVE

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.965
ANY.

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:21.934
STRUCTURE TO IT BUT IF IT'S A

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.836
FOR THAT MIGHT HAVE A I AM A

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.671
DEVICE OR STEERING OR SOMETHING

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:26.872
LIKE THAT OTHERS.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF AUTOMATED

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:29.908
VEHICLES SO.

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.109
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:32.344
ISSUE WE'LL SEE.

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.179
IF IT WERE GOING TO HAVE A FIVE

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.481
YEAR PERIOD WITH THIS LAW WILL

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:37.516
BE IN EFFECT.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.318
UNDER THE MOTION.

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:42.721
AND IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.490
EXPERIENCE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:45.924
YEAH I THINK INSTEAD OF

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.159
MANDATING IT RIGHT.

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.228
BECAUSE TIME GOES ON IF IT'S

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.296
SOMETHING THAT -- IS FELT BY THE

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.931
TRANSIT OPERATORS IN THAT THE

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.200
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES SOME CLEAN UP

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.802
LANGUAGE COULD BE BROUGHT INTO.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.103
TO MODIFY BUT FOR NOW THIS IS

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.606
THE FIRST STEP YEAH WE HAVE

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.207
SEVERAL TEST ON AUTOMATED

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:04.343
VEHICLES GOING ON AROUND THE

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.745
STATE AND WE HAD A HEARING IN

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:07.346
THIS COMMITTEE ON THE SUBJECTS

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:08.680
SO I THINK.

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:11.783
WE'RE GETTING TO A POINT WERE IN --

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.852
FUTURE.

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.419
YEARS WE'RE GOING TO START

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.287
SEEING.

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.956
SOME RESULTS ON THOSE -- TEST

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.057
AND SEE WOOD.

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:21.226
THINGS LIKE THE ACCIDENT RATE

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.728
WITH -- HOW?

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.329
I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.265
FOR ME HOW.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.267
AUTOMATED VEHICLES DEAL WITH THE

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:30.435
DISABLED PEOPLE WITH --

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.305
DIFFERENT KINDS OF ABILITIES --

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.507
ELDERLY -- CHILDREN YOU KNOW

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.175

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:42.147
THE COCOA YEAH -- HOW DO THEY

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.883

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.319
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SAFE -- A

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:51.557
LOT OF OUR TRANSIT -- WORKERS.

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:55.027

DISABLED -- SO WE REALLY DEPEND

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:13.145
ON THOSE DRIVERS.

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:14.947

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.386
IMPORTANT CONCERN THAT WE THEY

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:22.767
NOW THAT I'M TWO FOR TWO YEAH

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.369

USED IN BEWILDERED -- SO -- THAT

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.076
WOULD BE THE THE GOAL THE END

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.845
PRODUCT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.079
GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.848

DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLE --

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.034
PLACES SOMEBODY ON THERE HOW HOW

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.202
THAT HAPPENED RIGHT NOW IT'S

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.570
SELF APPOINTED TO ASSURE MAKE

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:06.938
SOME AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT REAL

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:08.773
SPECIFIC BUT WE'RE JUST LOOKING

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.274
AT HOW DO WE GET YOU KNOW.

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:12.443
WE ARE MAKE IT SO UBER FORMAL

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.145
IT'S LIKE LET'S GET SOMETHING

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:15.079
DONE REPORT BACK TO US HELP US

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.314
OUT.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.748
WITHOUT MAKING IT A YOU KNOW.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.116
SO THIS IS MORE IT IS IT'S

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:20.585
INFORMATION ON AMBER INFORMATION

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:21.886
FINDING IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A A

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.454
MANDATE THAT -- THEIR FINDINGS

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.556
HAVE TO BE MANDATED INTO SERVICE

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.458
OR AS A WAY TO EDUCATE THE DMB

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.360
ON HOW TO BETTER -- RUN THE

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.395
MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IT'S IT'S

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.264
THE LATTER IT INTO ITS LET'S

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.932
LET'S IT'S A IT'S A I'M GETTING

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:37.134
THE IMPRESSION CENTER STONE THAT

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.270
YOU KNOW IF WE WERE BOTH FROM

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.404
SUPERVISOR LAND.

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.607
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE TO

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.375
MANAGE THE STATE OR WE HAVE TO

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:45.877
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO STATE THROUGH

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:47.144
LEGISLATION.

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.913
AND SO THIS WAS THE IDEA IT WAS

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.947
OKAY LET'S.

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.849
IT'S GOT A COMMITTEE TOGETHER --

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.317
BECAUSE WE NEED TO REASSURE THE

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:58.523
VOTERS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:59.223
ALLOWING.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:35:59.824
NON RESIDENTS TO REGISTER TO

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:00.191
VOTE.

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.826
AND SO WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.761
INTEGRITY SO.

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.531
WHAT'S IT WHAT'S A CORDIAL WAY

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.533
TO FACILITATE THAT OPPORTUNITY

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.968
AND THIS IS THE APPROACH WE TOOK.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.837
WELL OBVIOUSLY -- THE STRUCTURE

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.305
WITH THE THE DEPARTMENT OR

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:17.041
VEHICLES WE SET A LARGE HEARING

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:22.580
OF ONE WAS AT THE MONDAY -- YEAH.

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:23.981
THE DAYS AGO BY SO FAST HERE AND

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:25.316
AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE A AN

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:27.018
AGENCY THAT HAS A LOT A LOT OF

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:30.388
ISSUES AND FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.690
TASKMASTER THE NICELY.

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.025
SECRETARY THAT WAS THERE -- CAM

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:35.560
OR HER NAME BUT SHE WAS

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:38.729
WONDERFUL AND SHE HAS SIX MONTHS

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.431
TO COME UP WITH --

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.500
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE CAN

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.002
MAKE OUR DEPARTMENT OF A MOTOR

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:47.705
VEHICLES A STELLAR DEPARTMENT --

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.006
I MENTIONED DURING THAT HEARING

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:51.709
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.678
INTERACTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.046
BULLS COMMON WITH THE STATE

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.148
AGENCY AND THAT FIRST IMPRESSION

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.749
IS A LASTING IMPRESSION AND

00:36:58.816 --> 00:36:59.784
CERTAINLY.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:00.885
THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DMP IS

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.653
BEEN GIVING AND I ALSO QUALIFY

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.889
THIS OF 90% OF THE EMPLOYEES OF

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.057
THE DMV ARE HARD WORKING

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.825
DEDICATED PEOPLE I JUST THINK

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:08.426
THERE WAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:09.760
AT THE TOP THAT.

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:10.928
BECAUSE THE THE AGENCY DIFFICULT

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:14.532
THE FUNDER -- BUT I SEE THIS IS --

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.834
AWAY TO HELP IDENTIFY PROBLEMS

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.302
AND THE RESULTS AREN'T

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.071
NECESSARILY MANDATED I THINK

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:21.505
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO BRING TO

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.908
LIGHT -- ISSUES A COULD IMPROVE

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:27.078
THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM -- AND

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:28.412
FOR THOSE REASONS MISTER SHERROD

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:30.314

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.849

COLLEAGUE AND I I DO SUPPORT THE

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:46.964

WHAT WE CAN DO IN A PROFESSIONAL

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:52.770
MANNER TO GET RESOLVED WITHOUT

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.305
YOU KNOW CREATING?

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.374
A COMMITTEE THE LAST FOR UMPTEEN

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.376
YEARS YOU CAN BE ANOTHER BOX WE

00:37:58.442 --> 00:37:59.543
CAN'T BLOW UP.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.445
LET'S LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:03.648
TRY SOMETHING IN A IN A IN A

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:04.882
FORMAL THE IF AND I'M A KIND OF

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.450

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:28.572
WITH THE COMMITTEE TAKING A LOOK

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.641
AT WHERE THE ERRORS OCCUR IT

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.877
WILL BECOME VERY APPARENT IT IS

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:35.079
IN THE FIRST SCREEN WHERE YOU DO

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.781
NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.349

PEOPLE ON WHERE THIS IS HAPPENED

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.358
OR BEEN INTERVIEWED WHEN YOU

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.627

A CITIZEN THAT INFORMATION IS

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:56.701
TRANSFERRED TO THE SECRETARY OF

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.201
STATE.

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.202
I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.704
CONGRESS PEOPLE IS A MATTER OF

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.005
FACT THAT.

WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:04.208
THOUGHT UNDOCUMENTED ON TRYING

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.043
TO BECOME CITIZENS THAT THEY

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.746
HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED WITH

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:10.281

TARGETED. FOR SOME SORT OF PICK

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.789

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.494
COALITION I DO WANNA QUICKLY

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.696
FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.031
ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE IS IS

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:22.599
OUTSTANDING AND THAT HAS TO DO

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:23.667
WITH THE FIX THE TICKET

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.568
COMPONENT.

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.970
OF THE BILL AND AND PROVIDING A

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.438
CERTAIN TIME FRAME FOR AN

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:32.142
OPERATOR TO CORRECT A VIOLATION --

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.977
AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE NOW

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.612
SAYS NOTES THAT -- AT LEAST IN

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:36.613
OUR OPINION FROM AGRICULTURE

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.248
THAT THAT THAT WINDOW SHOULD BE

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:39.082
NINETY DAYS.

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.917
AND WE THINK THAT IS A GOOD

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:43.486
EXAMPLE AND A REASONABLE REQUEST --

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.754
AND A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.756
REFLECTS A SORT OF A VERY BUSY

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.158
TIMES DURING OUR PLANNING AND

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:52.329
HARVESTING SEASONS -- THAT WE

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.763

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.831
AGRICULTURE AND I I JUST WANNA

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.533
MAKE ONE QUICK EXAMPLE AND IT'S

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.134
MORE THE LIVESTOCK SIDE GIVEN

00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:00.170
WHO I REPRESENT BUT LIVE SOCCER

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.072
PRIMARILY MOVE TWICE A YEAR --

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.007
IN THE IN THE SPRING -- ERECTION

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.942
STARTING IT RIGHT NOW -- WITH A

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.010
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIVESTOCK

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.279
THAT ARE MOVED -- FROM FROM

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.981

MARKETED DURING THOSE PERIODS.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.354
AND THEY ROUGHLY RUN FOR ABOUT

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.922
NINETY DAYS AND THAT'S IN THE

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.490

WORK TO DO OTHER THAN COST

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.115
RECOVERY I I I LOOK AT THIS

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:47.784

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.455
AGREE WITH THAT -- IT'S NOT FAIR

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:55.258
TAX ON RESPONSIBLE TRUCK OWNERS.

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:58.094
AND I GUESS YEAH WHAT WE'VE DONE --

00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.096
THROUGH OUR PROGRAMS WHICH ARE

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.431
RIGHT AND JUST LOOK AT WE GOTTA

GET CLEAN AIR IN THE STATE AND-SO WHAT WE'VE DONE.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:07.170
IS WE FORCE TRUCKING COMPANIES.

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:08.972
TO REALLY GO THE EXTRA MILE IN

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.140
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY BUY A

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.176
NEW VEHICLES WHILE WE'VE BEEN

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.911
ALLOWING OTHER VEHICLES TO COME

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.246
IN AND THE POLLUTE THE AIR SO

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.781
ONCE AGAIN WHAT MY BIGGEST

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.017
CONCERN HERE IS ONCE AGAIN.

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.753
THE RESPONSIBLE TRUCK OWNERS.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.188
ARE GETTING TAXED.

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:27.690
AND ALSO WHAT I SEE IS YOU I

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:31.327
USED TO OWN -- PROBABLY THE OVER

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.795
TWENTY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.997
TRUCKS.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.066
AND WHEN YOU BUY A NEW VEHICLES --

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.302
PRESUMABLY YOU'RE PARTICULARLY

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.570
IN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.171
THIS STARTS.

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:43.873
BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.274
THIS IDEA AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.442
THE DURATION OF THE TIME PERIOD

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:49.879
IS -- EVEN WITH CARS THESE DAYS

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:50.947
HOW OFTEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE DONE

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.715
BUT WITH THE NEW TRUCKS WITH THE

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.018
NEW FILTERS AND EVERYTHING THEY

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.587
HAVE -- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.422
BUYING A NEWER TECHNOLOGY SHOULD

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.857
BE GRANDFATHERED IN IT SEEMS TO

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.258
ME MAYBE THAT'S YOUR BILL I DID

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.228
NOT READ THAT -- YOU KNOW IN IN

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:07.397
IN IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.965
SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION --

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:11.601
THIS IS A SMALL CHECK IT'S NOT A

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.469
TAX SO IT'S LIKE YOU AND I WHEN

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.338
WE TAKE OUR VEHICLES -- EVERY

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.672
YEAR EVERY OTHER YEAR DEPENDING

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.041
ON THE MAKE AND MODEL AND THE

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.643
YEAR OF OUR CAR WE TAKE IT IN TO

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:21.978
GET A SMOG EMISSIONS TEST.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.179
WHEN WE FOUND OUT A FEW YEARS

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.881
AGO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT ARE

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.716
BIG DIESEL TRUCKS THAT ARE ON

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.851
THE ROADS MORE THAN WE TRAVEL AS

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.421
PASSENGER CARS -- DAY IN AND DAY

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.121
OUT YOU HEARD OVER A MILLION

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.357
MILES ON A TRAVERSE OUR ROADS

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.159
EACH YEAR I THOUGHT WELL IT

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:38.795
DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE TO ASK.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.496
BIG RIGS TO DO THE SAME THE EACH

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.165
AND EVERYONE OF US TO WITH OUR

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.533
PASSENGER VEHICLES.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:46.035
SO THE THE BILL CURRENTLY

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.303
REQUIRES THE A. R. B. TO

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.538
ESTABLISH DIFFERENT TESTING

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.673
PROCEDURES AND A REQUIREMENT FOR

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.442
DIFFERENT MODEL YEARS TO ACCOUNT

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.676
FOR THE STANDARDS AND THE CAP

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.278
THE CAPABILITIES OF NEWER AND

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.480
OLDER MODELS.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.115
SO IF YOU'RE IN A NEWER TRUCK.

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.016
I I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:00.616
TO BE YOU MIGHT NEED A SMOG

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:01.984
CHECK EVERY OTHER YEAR LIKE WHEN

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.820
YOU DRIVE A NEWER CAR NOW I KNOW

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.221
THAT SOME OF THE NEWEST CARS AT

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:06.155
A MINUTE THE LOWEST.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.957
MICHAEL A FEW YEARS WITHOUT

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.592
HAVING TO HAVE A SMOG CHECK THIS

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.194
WOULD BE SIMPLEST BILL WOULD BE

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.896
SIMILAR FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS.

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.932
THE BILL ALSO CURRENTLY ALLOWS

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:16.999
FOR STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.501
TRUCKS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.837
HISTORY OF BEING WELL MAINTAINED.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.438
CURRENTLY THE AIR BE AN INDUSTRY

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.207
ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO ALLOW WELL

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.008
MAINTAINED FLEET TO CONSISTENTLY

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.977
REPORT ON TIME. TO DECREASE THE

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.545
FREQUENCY OF TESTING TO EVERY

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.514
OTHER YEAR INSTEAD OF EVERY YEAR

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.349
OR JUST SIMPLY SUBMIT DATA IN

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.351
LIEU OF OPACITY TESTING FOR

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.153
ENGINES TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OR

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:37.987
NEWER.

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:41.757
WE INTEND THIS BILL TO TRACK

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:42.892
WITH THOSE FLEXIBILITY AS IT'S

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.193
ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.595
COMMERCIAL TRUCKS ARE DRIVING A

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.330
LOT MORE MILES AND MORE

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:49.365
POLLUTING THE RANK OF REGULAR

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.833
VEHICLES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.635
SO INCREASE SMOG CHECK FREQUENCY

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.871
AS NECESSARY ONE OF THE THINGS

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:55.972
THAT WE HEARD WHEN WE INITIALLY

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.206
INTRODUCES BILL A COUPLE YEARS

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.541
AGO AS WELL WHAT WE DO WITH THE

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.876
OUT OF STATE TRACKS WE CAN DO

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:00.676
ALL THIS GREAT WORK IN

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:01.878
CALIFORNIA.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.379
BUT WHAT WE DO NGUYEN TRUCKS

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.947
COME IN FROM OTHER STATES.

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.150
THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.152
TO OPERATE THEY WILL HAVE TO GET

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:11.287
A SMOG CHECK AS WELL SO WE THINK

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.421
THAT THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.157
FIELD FOR THE TRUCKERS.

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.725
AND THE TRUCK DRIVERS HERE IN

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.894
CALIFORNIA AND A LOOK MEANS THE

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.495
BAD ACTORS OUT OF STATE WILL

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.530
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:23.065
REGULATIONS AS WELL I HOPE THAT.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.934
SOMEHOW I I THINK IT DOES I I

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.136
GUESS WHAT I'LL DO IS I WILL

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.504
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.606

WHETHER IT'S AN INDUSTRY OR

GETTING THE FEE STRUCTURE TAKING

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:45.047
CARE OF LIKE I SAID EARLIER I

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.582
THINK THAT TAT'S BETTER SUITED

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.384
FOR A FISCAL PA FISCAL COMMITTEE

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.619

OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY -- AND I

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:55.024
COULD JUST PULL A NUMBER OUT BUT

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.058
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT IT MIGHT

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.560
BE TOO LOW IT MIGHT BE TOO HIGH

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.728
WE REALLY WANT TO DO A GOOD

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.029
FISCAL ANALYSIS.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:02.365
AND AND OF COURSE WAS LOOKING TO

GET THE LOWEST FEE TO COVER THE

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.003
COST OF THE PROGRAM.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.371
HI THIS IS NOT A MONEY MAKING

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.573
PROGRAM THIS IS STRICTLY BE TO

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.108

THAT IS A CONCERN TO FOLKS AND

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.881
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT.

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.516
IN THE LAST PIECE IS ON FIXING

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.450

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:23.686
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.354
A SWEET SPOT AND I DON'T WANT TO

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.489
PUT WORDS IN THE MOUTH.

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.024

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.270
HAVE A FIX THE TICKET WE WANT

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:43.372
THEM TO CONTINUE. TO FINISH THAT

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.975
LOAD -- ALSO WITH -- FRUITS

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.376
VEGETABLES WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.978
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD SO WE DON'T

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.013
WANT TO CAUSE ANY HARM TO PEOPLE

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.782
AND I AGREE I THINK I ABSOLUTELY

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:53.949
THINK BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SUCH A

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.217
PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.452
WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:57.987
THAT WE CAN FIND THE SWEET SPOT

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:58.721
AND FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.656
FOR EVERYONE IN MY LAST QUESTION

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.625
ON THAT SWEET SPOT AT WHICH IS

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.559
VERY TECHNICAL.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.361
IS -- DO YOU HOPE TO HAVE THAT

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.130
PRIOR TO APPROPRIATIONS OR IT

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.532
CONTINUE TO WORK ON A JUST WHAT

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.133
WHAT YOUR IDEAS YEAH I MEAN WE

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.068
CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:17.039
STAKEHOLDERS ON A VERY FREQUENT

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:17.707
BASIS -- WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.341
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO BUT WE

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.241
WANT TO DO IT AS SOON AS

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:19.508
POSSIBLE.

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:20.710
SO LOOK I I THINK THE BOTTOM

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:21.377
LINE IS IN AND I WILL STOP THE

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.912

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:49.932
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW ARE

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.333

THERE FROM OUT OF STATE THEY

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.854
HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT TO OPERATE.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.389
IF THIS BILL PASSES AND BECOMES

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.124
LAW THEY WILL HAVE TO DO A SMOG

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.592
CHECK BEFORE THEY CAN GET THEIR

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:18.627
PERMIT TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.062
SO THAT'S HOW WE WILL DO IT IF

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.063
THEY COME IN THEY GET PULLED

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:24.467

BE QUITE THAT SIMPLE NOTHING

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.638
EVER IS BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:30.840
THAT EASY.

PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THIS

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.488
WHOLE ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS NOT

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.690
A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT EVEN AND

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:48.424

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.959
IS DONE NOW TO TRY AND FIND THE

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:51.927
BAD ACTORS SO THIS IS TRYING TO

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.629
BRING SOME REGULATION TO THE

MOUNTAINS WHEN I WAS IN GRADE

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:20.849

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS THE

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.858
MEMBERS THE COUPLE OF THINGS

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.393
YEAR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.195
POINTS OUT THAT THE FUNDING FOR

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.930
THIS GRANT PROGRAM COMES FROM

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.732
THE CDC WITH GUIDELINES

PRESCRIBED BY THE CDC SO TO THE

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.502
CONCERNS -- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO

MEET WITH THE OPPOSITION ALBEIT

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.439

BUT I THINK WHAT'S CLEAR IN THE

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.312
ANALYSIS IS THAT THE CDC IS

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.547
INSTRUCTED TO COME UP WITH THE

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:26.915

ALLOCATED PROGRAMMATIC SAVINGS

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.055

WE'RE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO IT --

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:38.560
BUT I I I DON'T SEE A REAL

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.629

AMOUNT.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.927
AND IT SAYS OKAY WE TAKE THEIR

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.462
PROJECTS SAVINGS MAY WE CAN USE

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:50.532
THAT MONEY. TO UPGRADE

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:50.832
[inaudible]

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:54.369

FROM A TRADE QUARTER STANDPOINT.

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:19.694
SO I CAN I I WHEN I LOOKED AT

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:20.862
THIS I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S A

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.397
PRETTY LOGICAL THING IT'S NOT A

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.099
LOT OF MONEY BUT I THINK WHAT IT

WILL DO IS HELP [inaudible]

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:29.304

EURO SERVING ALL THE COMMUNITIES.

01:54:12.078 --> 01:54:12.645
THE DON'T HOUSE PUBLIC SERVICE

01:54:12.712 --> 01:54:13.646
INNER CITY SERVICE I THINK

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:14.914
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.616

WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR.

01:54:18.151 --> 01:54:19.152
I MEAN SURROUND BROKE BROACH THE

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:21.054

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.922
THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE.

01:54:22.989 --> 01:54:24.557
AND WORK ON THAT TO CONTINUE

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:25.992
PRESS ONE OF THINGS ALL SAY THIS.

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:27.961
IS I KNOW THAT THE RAIL SYSTEM

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:30.763
BENEFITS FROM THE PRIVATE BUSES.

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.465
BECAUSE THEY DROPPED PASSENGERS

PRIVATE BUSES AND THEY GET ON

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:39.272
THE REAL LINES YES AND SO THAT

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.474
THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THE A RAIL

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:42.742

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:44.707
CROSSWALKS.

02:49:44.774 --> 02:49:46.342
THERE WERE A FEW NEAR MISSES BUT

02:49:46.409 --> 02:49:47.744
HERE I AM.

02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:49.479
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO DID

02:49:49.546 --> 02:49:51.481
NOT HAVE THE SAME LOT CAN I WON

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:52.382
IT REMEMBER.

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:54.083
DIEGO ESTRADA WHO WAS NINE YEARS

02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:58.221
OLD IN PART THEY'RE CALIFORNIA

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:58.788
WHO WAS STRUCK ON HIS WAY TO

02:49:58.855 --> 02:49:59.956
SCHOOL.

02:50:00.023 --> 02:50:01.224
AMIN ABANG WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD

02:50:01.291 --> 02:50:02.258
SHE WAS CROSSING THE STREET TO

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:03.026
CATCH THE BUS THAT WOULD

02:50:03.092 --> 02:50:04.627
ULTIMATELY TAKE HER TO SCHOOL.

02:50:04.694 --> 02:50:07.030
WHEN SHE WAS KILLED AND ERICA

02:50:07.096 --> 02:50:07.664
MEAN THOUGH WHO IS FIFTEEN YEARS

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:08.865
OLD?

02:50:08.932 --> 02:50:10.199
HE WAS JUST A FEW STEPS FROM THE

02:50:10.266 --> 02:50:11.768
GATE OF HIS SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS

02:50:11.834 --> 02:50:14.237
STRUCK BY A VEHICLE.

02:50:14.304 --> 02:50:16.539
WE CN ARGUE ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE

02:50:16.606 --> 02:50:18.007
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:19.008
DEATHS.

02:50:19.075 --> 02:50:20.677
BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

02:50:20.743 --> 02:50:21.210
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:24.280
PROTECTED -- CHILDREN AND

02:50:24.347 --> 02:50:26.649

RELY ON GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:50:30.587 --> 02:50:32.355
FOR THEIR SAFETY.

02:50:32.422 --> 02:50:34.657
THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THE ODDS

02:50:34.724 --> 02:50:35.925
FOR MANY OF THE RURAL
