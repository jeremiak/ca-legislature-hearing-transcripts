00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.087
AND NOW WE'RE ASKING TO GIVE

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:59.157
THEM UNLIMITED POWER.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.892
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:02.594
THERE WAS INTRODUCED WHILE THIS

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.130

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.603
SITUATION.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.971
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.440
AUTHORITY TO MASS VACCINATE

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:15.740

THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:21.879
BUT IN THAT SAME PRESS

I HOPE YOU IN YOUR MIND TODAY.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.724
THOUSANDS OF PARENTS HAVE BEEN

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:38.029
SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN CAME UP AND

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:38.596
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:40.531
ADDRESSED WAS THE CDC

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:43.935
WHISTLEBLOWER WILLIAM THOMPSON.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:45.703
WHO CAME OUT AND SAID THAT IN

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.205
THE CDC THEY HAVE BEEN

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.240
COMMITTING FRAUD IN TERMS OF OUR

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.109
VACCINATION PROGRAM?

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:53.945
OUR CONCERN OF THOR TARIAN THIS.

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.613
AND I HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.348
RELEASED TAILORED TO MEET THAT

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.817
SPECIFIC NEEDS DURING THE AUDIT

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.719
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:03.421
ARE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:05.323
SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WERE

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.958
THAT YOU CAN USE HAND WASHING

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:09.861
STATIONS ACCESS TO RUSH ROOMS.

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.596
THAT STREET CLEANING THESE WERE

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:13.031
MEASURES THAT WE ABSOLUTELY

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.332
SUPPORT.

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.833
WE HAVE HOMELESS CAMPS ACROSS

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.169
THIS COUNTRY AND THE SITUATIONS

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.505
ARE ABSOLUTELY A DIRE TRUTH THAT

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.040
THIS IS A SITUATION THAT COULD

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.876
CAUSE A PLAGUE.

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.010
WE HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY DO

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:27.979
WE HAVE SUCH A HOMELESS EPIDEMIC

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.981
IN THISCOUNTRY.

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.349
AND I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:32.550
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS WE ARE

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.585
OVERLY TAXED.

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.054
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.989
LIVING INSIDE OF THE UNITED

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.357

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.159
ADDRESS THIS I'M WITH YOU IN

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.593
FULL SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.995
TREAT THESE PEOPLE NOT AS RATS

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.363
IN THE STREETS THESE ARE HUMAN

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.131
BEINGS.

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:48.199
SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS SIMPLY

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:50.101
THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:52.203

THAT REQUIRES A HUMANE APPROACH

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:06.451

THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD AND

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.030
COULD RESULT IN THE ABUSE OF

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:37.208
THE HEALTH OFFICER DEEMS

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.477
NECESSARY IT'S THAT WOULD ANY

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.045

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:43.181
WITH -- IT

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.249
ALSO IN THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:46.784
EVEN MORE BROAD THAT SAY THAT

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.186
DURING AN OUTBREAK OF

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.654
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OR UPON

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.489
IMMINENT AND PROXIMATE THREAT OF

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:53.825
A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE --

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.927
THE THE BACK ACTION SHOULD BE

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:56.627
TAKEN.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.197
ON AN OUTBREAK IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.865
ACCORDING TO THE CDC IS THREE

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.834
PEOPLE AN EPIDEMIC IS SEVEN

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.068
PEOPLE SO LET'S JUST BE CLEAR

00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:05.703
WHEN WE SAY OUTBREAK IT'S NOT

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.338
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:11.676
ABOUT FOR THREE PEOPLE --

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.344
YOUR AS LEGISLATORS TOSSED WITH

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:13.911
MAKING LAWS THAT A NARROWLY

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.880
TAILORED AND SPECIFIC THIS BILL

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:16.881
IS NOT.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:17.982
BOTH FROM THE ACTION OF THE

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.917
LOCAL HEALTH OFFICE CAN DIMOND

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.619
AND ALSO FROM A FISCAL

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.988
RESPONSIBILITY SO THIS ALLOWS A

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:25.423
HEALTH OFFICER TO TAKE ANY

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.026
ACTION REGARDLESS OF COST --

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:30.628
YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD IN

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.163
RESPONSE TO THE HEPATITIS A

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.965
OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO HOWEVER

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:35.299
THE AUDIT REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:36.834
THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT WHAT

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.903
ACTION WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED BUT

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.271
HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY THAT

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:41.772
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.140
THIS BILL DOESN'T FULLY ADDRESS

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:44.709
THAT AND INSTEAD GIVES THE LOCAL

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.244
HEALTH OFFICER JUST MORE POLICE

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.245
POWERS.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.112
WHILE WE MAY BELIEVE THAT

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.547
TODAY'S HEALTH OFFICES WOULD DO

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:51.315
THE RIGHT THING WE'VE ALL LIVED

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:52.950
IN A TIME WHERE WE DON'T AGREE

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:54.852
WITH THE FED OFFICIALS IN POWER.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.487
CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HIS

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:57.955
BRECHER OF MEDICAL ABUSE ON ITS

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.757
PEOPLE SO WHAT COULD THIS BILL

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.325
LEAD TO THE SEPARATION OF

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:02.660
CHILDREN AND PARENTS IF THEY

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.161
REFUSE MEDICAL TREATMENT

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:05.663
QUARANTINE OF EVERY MEMBER IN A

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.764
SUDDEN ZIP CODE.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.065
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IF AN

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.534
OFFICIAL WHO DECIDED THAT THE

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.168
NAME OF COMMON GOOD IN

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.103
PROTECTING OTHERS THAT THEY

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.070
COULD MARRY METAPHORICALLY

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.872
INVADE OUR BEDROOMS AND MANDATE

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.440
THAT EVERYONE HAD PROTECTED SEX

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:19.510
SO IT'S NICE TO DE EPIDEMIC

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:20.511
DOESN'T SPREAD?

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.479
THE LEGISLATURE IS TOSSED IT

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.447
DRAWING LINES THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.583
DRAW A LINE TO GIVE A SPECIFIC

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.418
EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:28.352
WHERE I GREW UP THERE WAS A

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.521
SWINE FLU OUTBREAK IN TWO

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.590
THOUSAND AND NINE ON THE

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.791
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT WE

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.426
HAVEN'T SO THE SOLUTION WAS TO

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:35.793
SIMPLY.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.763
VACCINATE SIX MILLION PEOPLE RAM

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.631
UNPRECEDENTED FOR IT SCOTT SCALE

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.733
AND ITS SIZE IT TURNS OUT BUT

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.735
ONE IN EVERY FIFTY THOUSAND

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:45.570
PEOPLE WHO WERE GIVEN THAT

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.337
VACCINE.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.205
IT CAUSED AN IMMUNE SYSTEM TO

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.774
ATTACK THE WHOLE CLASSED AS A

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.242
VENUE RUNS IN THEIR BRAIN.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.977
PEOPLE GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.478
THE VACCINE ACTUALLY TRIGGERS

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.247
THEIR OWN BODIES TO GIVE THEIR

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:57.615
BRAINS A PARTIAL LOBOTOMY.

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:58.716
NOW THE BEST SCIENTIST IN THE U.

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:00.685
K. STUDIED THIS FOR SIX YEARS

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:01.986
AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.054
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGAIN

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.755
OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY.

THE ACTION IT'S IT STATES THE

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:05.435
LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY CAN OR

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.103
THE OFFICER CAN TAKE ANY ACTION --

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.304
WHILE CALIFORNIA IT IS CORRECT

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:11.241
DOESN'T --

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:13.276
VACCINATIONS COULD BE MANDATED

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.912
SO DURING AN OUTBREAK OR FORCED

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.213
SO TO SPEAK --

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.748
AND SO OUR CONCERN IS OUR OUR

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.784
REQUEST IS TO HAVE THE THE

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.318
WEDDING CHANGED SO IT'S MORE

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.453
NARROWLY TAILORED SAID FOR

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.788
EXAMPLE THAT IT IS.

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.589
THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND LEAST

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.258
INVASIVE ACTION --

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:30.927
AND SO WHILE VACCINATION ISN'T.

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:31.728
YOU KNOW FOR THINGS LIKE

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.997
HEPATITIS A THE MEASLES OUTBREAK

FORCING YOU KNOW MEASLES

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.969
VACCINATIONS OR OR PUTTING THAT.

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:41.204
OUT THERE --

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.405
AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.841
CONCERN OF MANY OF THESE --

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:46.109
CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE COME

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.577
TODAY -- IS

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.579
THAT IT IT IS A POSSIBILITY THIS

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.314
BILL DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.917
THAT VACCINATIONS WOULD HAPPEN

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.719
BUT FOR ANYTHING THAT IS.

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.454
BACK SCENE HAS A VACCINE FOR IT

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.090
IS LIKELY THAT THAT VACCINE

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:00.690
WOULD BE PUSHED.

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:04.394
AND THAT'S THE CONCERN.

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.529
SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:06.730
THAT.

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:07.497
SHORT I..

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:08.565
I THINK I THINK THAT THIS IS A

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:10.633
POINT OF OF OF AGREEMENT.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.401
BETWEEN THE PARTS OF THIS BILL

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:11.668
MYSELF --

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:13.336
THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.839
PRESCRIBE COMPULSORY BACK.

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:18.141
IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION --

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.743
THAT THE BILL SPEAKS --

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:20.343
TO IN TERMS OF THE AUTHORITY

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.446
THAT'S GIVEN I MEAN WE'RE WITH

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.614
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.715
AND WE'RE HAVING ONGOING

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:27.217
CONVERSATIONS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:28.718
PROFESSIONALS TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.687
THE IN SOME CASES THIS IS TAYLOR --

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.122
OUTBREAKS LIKE LIGHTS WOULD NOT

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.189
REQUIRE THIS KIND OF

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.924
INTERVENTION RIGHT --

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:40.096
BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE THE MOST

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:40.597
SUITED INTERVENTIONS --

00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:42.132
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.600
CONTINUE TO TO VACCINATIONS BUT

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:44.868
VERY MUCH WHAT THE OPPONENTS ARE

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.069
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.303
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO TELL

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.539
THE CITY AS THEY DID TO MINE --

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:50.974
THAT YOU NEED TO START PUTTING --

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.875
PORTA POTTIES --

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:54.911
IN IN HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:57.914
HOMELESS IS THERE XIN THAT WE

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.282
WERE SEEN AND ACTUALLY SPREAD

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.084
THIS DISEASE THAT'S WE'RE

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:01.718
TALKING ABOUT TENS OF ANY TERMS

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:03.186
OF PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:04.354
AUTHORITY AND TAILORING AND I

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.922
THINK RISKS THE ABILITY OF BEING

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.257
SO PRESCRIPTIVE THE POINT THE

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:07.957
BILL DOES IT MAKE.

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.259
DOES NOT ALLOW THE KINDS

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:10.326
INTERVENTIONS WERE TALKING OUT

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:11.127
WE'RE TALKING A HEPATITIS IN

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.796
THIS CASE IT COULD BE ANOTHER

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.164
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE --

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.165
AND SO THIS PROVIDES THE

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.733
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE INVOLVED --

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.401
THE LATITUDE THAT THEY NEED TO

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:19.469
BE EFFECTIVE --

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:20.403
A SPEAKING WITH THE

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.905
PROFESSIONALS WHO DO THIS WORK

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.273
NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.175
REACHING THE CONSTITUTION OR IN

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:25.642

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:26.743
OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.511

A VARIETY OF REASONS. ONE OF THE

SENATE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH AND

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:17.553

LANGUAGE AND PARTIALLY ENGLISH --

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.677
MOST OF THIS COMES FROM JUST

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:42.979
CONVICTIONS OF DECIDING THAT

OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:27.355
AGAIN THIS IS THE GOAL OF THIS

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.257
BILL IS TO STOP PEOPLE FROM OVER

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.393

A CLINICAL SETTING WHERE THEY

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.371
WERE WERE THEY ARE MEDICALLY

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.706
SUPERVISED.

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.474
WE KNOW FROM OVER A HUNDRED

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.243
PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD THAT

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.445
THIS IS AFFECTED IN REDUCING

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.580
OVERDOSES.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:54.449

I'M SURE EVERYONE OF YOU IN YOUR

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.928
DISTRICTS HAVE HAD AREAS WHERE

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.630
THE POLICE HAVE TO GO IN AND DO

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.432
SWEEPS TO CLEAR OUT WE'RE HOMES

PEOPLE ARE PUBLICLY USING AND

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:14.803
ONE OF THEBIGGEST AFTER EFFECTS

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.238
IS THE AMOUNT OF NEEDLES THAT

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:18.173
ARE FOUND IN PARKS AND PUBLIC

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.141
SPACES AFTERWARDS WHERE CHILDREN

HAVE ACCESS TO THEM.

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.378
AND WHERE DISEASE CONTINUES TO

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.546
SPREAD.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.715
THIS BILL HAS A SIX YEAR SUNSET

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.650
WHICH REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:29.951
TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:31.386
THE IMPACTS.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.354
ON THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE IN

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.022
THE PROGRAM WHO'S USING THE

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.490

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.125
GETTING REFERRED TO TREATMENT SO

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.493
WE CAN ACTUALLY.

OVERWHELMED WITH PEOPLE COMING

REDUCTION FIRMLY BELIEVING IN

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.754
THAT EVERY LIFE MATTERS AND THAT

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.293
AS MUCH AS WE CAN EXPAND ACCESS

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.429
TO TREATMENT AS MUCH AS WE CAN

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.364
ASK OF A TO TO TO BE ABLE TO

TELL PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT THEM

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:51.333

WORK IN A LONG TIME AND

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.742
ADDICTIONS FOR A LONG TIME.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.810
I CAN TELL YOU THE NUMBER ONE

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:02.711
THING THAT I WOULD TEACH

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:03.345
STUDENTS AND I WOULD WORK WITH

A RELATIONSHIP THEN IT'S REALLY

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.083
HARD TO GET ANYBODY TO CHANGE

HIGHEST RATE FOR OVERDOSED.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.031
THE ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:38.199
SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THEIR

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.400
ILLNESS.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:40.535
I PERSONALLY VISITED THE

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.337
ENCYCLOPEDIA VANCOUVER WERE MUCH

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:43.638
OF THE RESEARCH IS DERIVED IN IN

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:46.140
THAT CLINIC I SAW A CLINIC THAT

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.442
REMINDED ME OF MY SAN FRANCISCO.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:49.177
BE A METHADONE PROGRAM IT WAS A

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.378
COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE CARED

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.279
ABOUT IT.

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.580
AND IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.083
THE PATIENT STEP PARTICIPATED.

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.051
IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO THEIR

01:25:57.118 --> 01:26:00.188
OPTIMAL OUR STATE IS VERY CLEAR

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:00.989
WITH OVERDOSE PREVENTION

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:03.291
PROGRAMS IT REDUCES OVERALL DRUG

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.860
USE DISCARDED SYRINGES HIV AND

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.395
HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS.

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.897
OVERDOSE DEATHS AND PEOPLE WHO

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:10.265
PARTICIPATE IN OVERDOSE

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.333
PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE MUCH

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.868
MORE LIKELY TO ENTER TREATMENT

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.770
IF SOMEBODY PARTICIPATES WITH IN

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:16.604
SUCH A PROGRAM.

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:17.438
THEY HAVE ENCOUNTER WITH A

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.207
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL WHO

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:20.875
CARES ABOUT THEM AS A PERSON.

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:23.611
WE OFFER THE IDEA OF TREATMENT

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:24.178
THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.046
LISTEN.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.881
OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IS

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.550
TREATMENT.

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:29.584
THERE'S NO CONFLICT BETWEEN

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.120
SUPERVISE USE AND STOPPING DRUGS

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.021
IT'S PART OF THE CONTINUUM OF

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:34.789
CARE AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT HARM

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.357
REDUCTION BECAUSE WE THINK OF

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:38.259
ABSTINENCE AS PART OF A HARM

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:39.894
REDUCTION IT IS.

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:41.062
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE THE HARDEST

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:42.864
WAY TO ACHIEVE IT WHEN YOU GET

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:44.766
PEOPLE ENGAGE WITH AN OVERDOSE

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.367
PREVENTION PROGRAMS YOUR

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:48.102
OFFERING THEM TREATMENT.

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.170
BOTH FOR THE ADDICTION ITSELF

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.438
AND THE CO MORBID MEDICAL

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:53.241
CONDITIONS THAT OCCUR AS

VIOLENCE.

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:00.448

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.683

OF MY THINKING ABOUT THE WORK

THAT I DO EVERY DAY AND HAVE

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.610

THAT CRISIS HAS NOT SKIP

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.454
CALIFORNIA --

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.989
NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:17.392
OF AN OVERDOSE IN TWENTY

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.159
SEVENTEEN AND SAN FRANCISCO

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.394
WHICH IS WHERE WE'RE REALLY

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.962
FOCUSING THIS PILOT --

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:23.197
NEARLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.198
DIED IN THE SAME YEAR.

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.533
SO -- IN

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.834
THIS PROJECT WERE REALLY

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.503
THINKING ABOUT REACHING THE

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:30.505
HARDEST TO REACH PEOPLE THAT

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:32.440
THERE ARE TO REACH WE SERVE LOTS

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.075
OF PEOPLE IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.843
WE DO A GOOD JOB WE'RE VERY

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.445
INVESTED IN CONTINUING THAT AND

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:39.180
YET THERE ARE STILL A POPULATION

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.548
OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE ARE NOT

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.984
ABLE TO REACH AND WE SEE THIS IS

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:43.484
THE AVENUE.

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:44.686
AS DOCTOR CONCERT WE SEE THIS IS

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:46.487
THE AVENUE TO HELP REACH THOSE

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:47.989
PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.357
SOME OF THE MYTHS.

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.292
AROUND THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.394
PROGRAMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.228
ABOUT OR THAT YOU MAY EVEN

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:55.763
CONSIDERING YOUR OWN THINKING

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:56.998
ONE IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.766
ENABLE DRUG USE --

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.735
THERE IS A BELIEF THAT WE NEED

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:02.537
TO MAKE THINGS REALLY REALLY

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:04.105
DIFFICULT AND WE NEED.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.007
TO IMPOSE A CRIMINAL SANCTIONS

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.442
AND BRING A GREAT DEAL OF MISERY

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.243
TO PEOPLE SO THAT THEY STOP

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:10.211
USING DRUGS AND THAT'S HOW THEY

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:12.280
COME TO RECOVERY WHEN IN FACT

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:13.181
HAVING DONE THIS WORK FOR A

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:14.082
REALLY LONG TIME.

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:15.349
THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE PATH

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.151
FOR PEOPLE TO RECOVERY IT IS

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:18.286
THROUGH RELATIONSHIP AND

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.454
CONNECTION AND IT'S TO HOPE THAT

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.855
PEOPLE MOVE TO RECOVERY THE

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.290
PEOPLE THAT WE SEE.

01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:24.992
AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:27.495
FOCUS THIS PROJECT ON IT IS NO

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:29.230
MORE DESPAIR THAT WE CAN BRING

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.032
TO BEAR ON THEIR LIVES THERE'S

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:31.833
ONLY DEATH THAT'S REALLY THE

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:32.800
ONLY.

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:35.169
OTHER OPTION LEFT SO SO THIS

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.571
ISN'T ENABLE IT THIS JUST MAKES

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:38.139
US HELPS US CONTACT PEOPLE WHO

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.874
ARE THE HARDEST TO REACH.

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.576
I THINK THE SECOND MATTHEW HERE

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:43.444
IS THAT THESE ATTRACT THANK YOU

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.912
BUT THIS ATTRACTS CRIME --

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.314
AND THIS IS NOT BEEN PROVEN TRUE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.648
IN ANY SITE WHERE THEY'VE

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:48.716
EXISTED OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:50.518
AROUND THE WORLD AND ACTUALLY WE

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.152
ARE YOU KNOW IN HARM REDUCTION

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.820
SITES THAT OPERATE CURRENTLY AND

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.255
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:55.323
IT'S NOT TRUE THERE IS WELL

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:57.158
PEOPLE ARE DRUG DEALERS ARE NOT

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.960
ATTRACTED TO COME TO NEEDLE

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.128
EXCHANGE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:00.728
THINK THAT'S WHERE THE DRUG

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:01.896
USERS ARE THAT HAS NOT BEEN

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:02.997
PROVEN TO BE TRUE.

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.665
IN HARM REDUCTION SITES AS WELL

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.001
IN THE FINAL MYTH IS THAT THERE

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.703
WERE WERE GIVEN A FALSE CHOICE

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.371
THAT SAYS IT'S EITHER THIS OR

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:11.806
TREATMENT.

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.307
AND NOT NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:14.742
SAYS THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:15.810
TREATMENT THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.245
HERE THAT SAYS WE'RE GONNA TAKE

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.846
MONEY AWAY OR RESOURCES AWAY.

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.214
FROM TREATMENT.

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.749
IN FACT WE THINK THIS IS

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:26.120
ACTUALLY A PART OF TREATMENT AND

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:26.988
ALL I CAN SAY IS.

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.556
IF A PERSON OVERDOSES THEY

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:29.524
REALLY DO HAVE INADVERTENT THEY

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.058
OVERDOSING DIE THEY NEVER HAVE

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.193

DRUG PROBLEMS --

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:50.231
I THINK THAT WAS EMBLEMATIC OF

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:51.499
THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE LAST

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:52.466

PRETTY --

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.605
COGENT ARGUMENTS AGAINST --

01:32:57.672 --> 01:33:00.708
THIS BILL FRANKLY MOST IF NOT

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:01.976
ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.544
ABSOLVED FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:04.779
UNDER THIS BILL.

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:06.347
REMAIN ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.448
SO WE'RE SETTING UP THE CITY AND

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:07.915
COUNTY --

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.784
AND MAYBE THEY DON'T MIND ABOUT

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.218
THIS BUT YOU'RE SETTING UP THE

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.520
CITY AND COUNTY --

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:13.888
FOR INSTEAD FIGHT BETWEEN STATE

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.523
AND FEDERAL LAW --

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:16.624
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:18.059
COME FROM THAT AND FRANKLY

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:19.894
DESPITE THE BILL'S ATTEMPT TO

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:20.528
PROTECT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:21.362
LIABILITY.

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.797
WE FEAR IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.632
TIME BEFORE PERSON WHO UTILIZES

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:26.233
ONE OF THESE PLACES --

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.502
WILL LEAVE THE FACILITY THERE IS

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.004
NO REQUIREMENT THAT A PERSON WHO

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.772
UTILIZES A SAFE INJECTION SITE

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.107
OR AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.342
PROGRAM --

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.310
WILL STAY UNTIL THEY ARE NO

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:37.511
LONGER UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:38.579
SO -- THIS

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.047
DOES NOT ABSOLVE A PERSON FROM

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.215
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:42.650
ILLEGALLY BUT IT CERTAINLY

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:43.918
CREATES A SITUATION WHERE WE

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:45.186
THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT SOMEONE

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:45.820
WILL COME TO THE ONE OF THESE

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.154
FACILITIES --

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.123
USED THEIR SUBSTANCES AND LEAVE

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.458
WHILE STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.359
PUTTING THE REST THE MOTORING

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:52.626
PUBLIC AT RISK NECK THAT'S JUST

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:53.828
ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR CONCERN IN

01:33:53.894 --> 01:33:55.830
THAT REGARD SO --

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:59.166
FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.402
OPPOSED TO THE THANK YOU.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:04.071
SO MY TWO WITNESSES AS YOU KNOW

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:04.739
SO.

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:06.574
WELL MY NAME IS FRANKLY I AM

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:11.045
OVER THE BAY AREA DIRECTOR OF

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:13.581
CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST TWO

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:14.982
THAT'S WHY WE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.550
OF RESIDENTS FROM SAN FRANCISCO

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:18.052
BAY AREA. TO COME HERE ALL THE

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.788
WAY TO SAY NO TO THIS BILL NO

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:22.923
DATE THE MAIN REASON OF THE

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.525
PROPONENT IS THAT THE WE WE DO

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:24.992
USE.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:27.628
DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH CASES BUT

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:29.830
ACTUALLY IS CERTAINLY WRONG YOU

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.298
KNOW ACCORDING TO BRITISH

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:34.402
COLUMBIA CORONERS SERVICES.

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:38.005
THE OVERDOSE THE TRUCK OVERDOSE

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:40.207
DEATH CASES ACTUALLY.

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.143
INCREASE OUR HUNT THE HOUSE IN

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:44.879
PERCENT OR ACTUALLY A TEN TIMES

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:46.947
YOU KNOW IN THE TEN YEARS SELF

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:49.850
OPERATIONS ALL OF THE INJECTION

CENTER AND BE A MAKEOVER.

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.586
THAT MEANS IS A BIG FAILURE AND

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:54.488
ALSO THIS BILL DOES NOT BE

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.856
CLAUDIA --

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.658
THE ANY DRUG ADDICTS TO GOAL FOR

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.460
TRUCK WE HABITATION RIGHT AFTER

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.228
DOING INJECTION SO THAT MEANS IT

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:09.136
JUST ENCOURAGES THEM --

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:09.737
TO TO DO MORE INJECTION TO USE

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.240
MY THE CAKE IT THIS BILL IS

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:15.209
ACTUALLY TAILOR MADE FOR DRUG

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AT BOTH

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:30.624
THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.493
THE DISADVANTAGES OF THIS BIãU

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.830
FAR AWAY AND THE POSSIBLE

THIS BILL LAST YEAR.

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:54.181
THE ISSUE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.118
IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A COG NICE

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:59.353

I DID HAVE A IN REGARDS --

01:43:57.431 --> 01:43:58.665
TO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE

SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:49.970
IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.805
WERE THAT WERE FACING WITH SO

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:52.539
NOT ONLY HOPEFULLY ARE WE

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:54.508
PROVIDING COMPASSION AND A PATH

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.009
TO TREATMENT A PATH TO DIGNITY

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.511
FOR THOSE WHO ARE USING.

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:58.745

OFTENTIMES POLICE AND FIRE AND

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:05.786
EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT ARE TAKING

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.087
UP WAY TOO MUCH OF THEIR TIME.

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:08.588
BEING CALLED TO OVERDOSE ON

01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:10.791
STREETS VERSUS BEING ABLE TO TO

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.325
DO THE WORK THAT WE WANTED TO DO

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:13.794
IT IN FIGHTING CRIME AND SAVING

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:14.795
LIVES.

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.329
IS THERE ANY FEAR AT ALL THAT

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.397
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ANY

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:18.799
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IT'LL

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:22.202
ACTUALLY DO MORE HARM.

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:23.003
THAN IT WOULD THEN IT WOULD GOOD.

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.437
WHAT WE HAVE DECADES OF RESEARCH

01:47:24.504 --> 01:47:25.672
FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAS

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:27.340
SHOWN THAT THAT NOT THAT NOT TO

01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:28.308
BE TRUE --

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.310
THAT PUBLIC USE TENDS TO GO DOWN

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:31.478
THAT --

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:32.979
POLICE OFFICERS OFTENTIMES

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:34.581
PUBLIC SAFETY WILL ENGAGE IN

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:35.882
RELATIONSHIP THEY SEE SOMEONE

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:36.716
USING IT'LL SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:38.118
A SAFE PLACE OVER HERE THAT YOU

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:39.586
CAN USE --

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:40.720
YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY IT'S

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:42.856
ENABLING LETTING SOMEONE CHEWED

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:44.891
UP IN A GUTTER OR IN A

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.359
PLAYGROUND --

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:47.594
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:49.129
OPTION I DON'T THINK THAT THAT

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.564
ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO SAY THAT

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.499
IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO VERSUS

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:53.667
GOING SOMEPLACE THAT IS

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.235
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED WE CAN BE

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:56.203
TREATED WITH DIGNITY.

01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:57.971
AND BEING REFERRED TO SERVICES

01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:59.773
REFER TO AGAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.441
YOU HAVE AN ABSCESS YOU KNOW A

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.976
AN ABSCESS ON A ON A TOWER

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.811
PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES USING THEY

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:06.313
CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER VANS.

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:06.913
THAT CAN LEAD TO A LOSS OF A

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:07.881
FOOT.

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.115
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN A

01:48:09.182 --> 01:48:10.817
WHEELCHAIR ON THE STREETS

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:12.485
STOPPING TRAFFIC I MEAN THE

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:14.888
AMOUNT OF COMORBIDITY THAT GOES

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:17.490
ALONG WITH IV DRUG USE AND AN

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:21.895
ABJECT POVERTY AND LIVING THEY

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:23.897
ARE ALREADY AT THE HIGHEST RISK

01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:25.065
FOR ALL KINDS.

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:27.100
OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES --

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.902
AND JUSTICE DID COMORBIDITY THAT

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.971
GOES ALONG WITH THAT SO AGAIN TO

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.372
BE ABLE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:33.440
TO BE ABLE TO GET REFER TO A

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:34.908
TREATMENT TO BE ABLE TO FIX AN

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.509
ABSCESS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:37.878
SEE AS POSITIVE.

01:48:37.944 --> 01:48:38.612
AND AGAIN YOU START THAT

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:40.247
RELATIONSHIP PEOPLE ARE MUCH

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:41.982
MORE LIKELY TO GET IN HE GOT THE

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:42.616
DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:43.817
PROGRAMS --

01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:44.951
IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE STATE OF

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.987
CALIFORNIA WAS SAYING THIS IS

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:47.520
GOOD THIS IS THE KIND A

01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:49.789
WRAPAROUND SERVICE THAT WE NEED

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:52.125
TO BE ABLE TO REACH THE VERY

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:53.326
HARDEST TO REACH.

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:54.394
I MEAN MAYBE JUST TELLING

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:56.162
SOMEBODY JUST SAY NO MIGHT HAVE

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.663
WORKED WHEN SOMEBODY'S A

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.565
TEENAGER SMOKING A LITTLE WEED.

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.600
BUT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HAVE --

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:01.768
GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:03.470
LIVING ON THE STREETS USING ON

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:05.038
THE STREETS --

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:06.606
SELLING THEIR BODIES --

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:07.974
TO BE ABLE TO TO GET THEIR NEXT

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:10.110
FIX THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK AS

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:12.145
IF WE'RE HUMANITARIANS WE WANT

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:13.346
TO ENGAGE WITH THAT WE WANT TO

01:49:13.413 --> 01:49:14.881
SAY WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:16.416
NOT NOT ON OUR CITIES NOT ON OUR

01:49:16.483 --> 01:49:17.684
STREETS.

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:18.485
WHEN THERE'S WHEN THERE ARE

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:19.219

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.187
DRIVEN OPTIONS THAT ARE

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:22.656

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:24.925
SUPERVISION IS THAT IS THAT

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:28.795
THEY'RE GONNA.

01:49:28.862 --> 01:49:32.299
THAT'S CORRECT AND AS IT WILL

01:49:32.365 --> 01:49:33.900
SEE THIS AS SAVINGS TURNING

A STATEWIDE BILL.

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:54.387
THAT WAS NARROWED DOWN TO THE

01:49:54.454 --> 01:49:55.488
COUNTY AND CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO

01:49:55.555 --> 01:49:58.925

IT THAT BECAUSE IT IS A PILOT

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.389

THINKING ABOUT THINGS ARE HARD

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.135
TO CHANGE BUT CERTAINLY I THINK

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:50.370
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT.

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:51.704

CURRENTLY DOING.

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.843
IS NOT REACHING EVERYBODY --

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:58.812
SO WE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS INTO

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:11.591
SOME RESISTANCE AND WE AGAIN WE

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:12.258
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IMPOSES ON

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:14.194
ANYBODY IF ANOTHER COUNTY OR

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.115
GOVERNOR BROWN.

02:33:11.181 --> 02:33:13.017
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS ARE ALREADY

02:33:13.083 --> 02:33:15.019
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:16.320
AND WHEN GIMMICKS BY PROVIDERS

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:17.321
ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:19.189
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE HIGHER

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:20.457
THAN THEY SHOULD BE.

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:22.526
IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING.

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:24.228
THIS BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:25.596
FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A

02:33:25.663 --> 02:33:26.897
MECHANISM TO ARTIFICIALLY

02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:28.566
GENERATES THREE TO FOUR TIMES

02:33:28.632 --> 02:33:30.100
THE MEDICARE RATE FOR PROVIDING

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.802

02:33:32.803 --> 02:33:34.438
ARGUMENTS AND HE EVEN ADDS A%

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:35.639
SCARE PATIENTS ABOUT HOW THE

02:33:35.706 --> 02:33:37.274
SYSTEM OF CARE WILL COLLAPSE OR

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:38.576
CLINICS WILL CLOSE.

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:40.945
THE COMMERCIAL MARKET MOVES TO A

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:42.179
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL.

02:33:42.246 --> 02:33:44.014
I CAN TELL YOU THAT OF A LOOK AT

02:33:44.081 --> 02:33:44.648
THIS CAREFULLY AND I QUESTIONED

02:33:44.715 --> 02:33:45.416
IT.

02:33:45.482 --> 02:33:47.117
I REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT THE

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:47.985
LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:49.420
RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:51.322
PROGRAM WILL FUNDAMENTALLY

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:52.489
DISRUPT THE CARE THAT PATIENTS

02:33:52.556 --> 02:33:54.658
RECEIVE.

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.160
THE GAMING OF THE SYSTEM IS

02:33:56.226 --> 02:33:57.861
HARMFUL IN MANY WAYS BUT OUR

02:33:57.928 --> 02:33:59.597
PRIMARY CONCERN IS HOW IT DRIVES

02:33:59.663 --> 02:34:01.298
UP THE COST FOR EVERYONE BY

02:34:01.365 --> 02:34:03.701
SHIFTING RISK TO A FRAGILE AND

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:05.169
COSTLY INDIVIDUAL MARKET.

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:06.303
HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS IN THE

02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:07.538
COMMERCIAL MARKET ARE

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:09.206
INCREASINGLY COSTLY AND THAT

02:34:09.273 --> 02:34:11.241

LEADING DIALYSIS COMPANY THAT

02:36:13.864 --> 02:36:17.134

EMPLOYER PROVIDE IT.

02:36:31.782 --> 02:36:34.017
THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE FOUR

02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:35.619
THOUSAND PATIENTS WHOSE

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:37.020

THOUSAND WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO

02:36:46.563 --> 02:36:48.599

CARE UNNECESSARILY.

02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:53.003
WHEN THAT GETS BUILT INTO THEIR

PREMIUMS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:36:55.572 --> 02:36:57.741
DRIVES UP THE COST OF CARE IT

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.376
TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS

02:36:59.443 --> 02:37:00.611

THOSE FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:21.498
STILL GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:36.914
FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.749
AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS REALLY

02:37:38.816 --> 02:37:40.284
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:41.185
AND FOR THE MEMBERS AND ALL THE

02:37:41.251 --> 02:37:42.786
TIME THAT WE SPENT WITH A LOT OF

02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:44.922
YOU TRYING TO EXPLAIN --

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.723
WHAT THIS DOES TO THE SYSTEM AND

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:48.692
HOW IT REALLY HARMS PREMIUM

02:37:48.759 --> 02:37:50.627
PAYERS AND I'D I'D FIRST LIKE TO

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.196
START UP WITH SAYING THAT AND NO

02:37:52.262 --> 02:37:53.430
WAY -- IS

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:55.098
THIS BILL INTENDED TO DISPARAGE

02:37:55.165 --> 02:37:57.401
THE GOOD WORKS OF NON PROFITS I

02:37:57.467 --> 02:37:59.269
THINK WE ALL SEE A ROLE FOR THEM

02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:00.971
TO PLAY IN IT CERTAINLY.

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:02.372
ONE THAT WE SUPPORT

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:03.540
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:05.809
A SMALL SUBSET OF PROVIDERS.

02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:08.345
USING THE GUARANTEED ISSUE --

02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:10.681
PROVISIONS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED

02:38:10.747 --> 02:38:13.984
IN THE A. C. THE SHIFT PEOPLE

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:15.886
FROM OTHERWISE BE MEDICARE

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:17.721
MEDICAID ELIGIBLE INTO

02:38:17.788 --> 02:38:19.223
COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE OF COVERAGE.

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:21.491
AND WHAT THAT REALLY DOES IS IT

02:38:21.558 --> 02:38:23.527
NOT ONLY PUTS THAT PATIENT AT

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:25.062
RISK IN SOME SENSES BECAUSE TO

02:38:25.128 --> 02:38:26.697
REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU'RE

02:38:26.763 --> 02:38:28.832
ON A COMMERCIAL PLAN EVEN A PPO

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:30.701
PLATINUM PLAN YOU MAY BE --

02:38:30.767 --> 02:38:32.369
HAVE TO PAY OTHER COPAYS

02:38:32.436 --> 02:38:34.571
COINSURANCE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE

02:38:34.638 --> 02:38:35.606
ARE INCREDIBLY SICK THEY HAVE

02:38:35.672 --> 02:38:37.207
COMORBIDITIES THEY OFTEN END UP

02:38:37.274 --> 02:38:39.209
IN THE HOSPITAL WITH THAT COMES

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:40.577
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF EXTRA

02:38:40.644 --> 02:38:42.079
COSTS THAT THEY MAY NOT

02:38:42.145 --> 02:38:44.314
NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND OR EXPECT.

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:45.582
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS IS

02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:47.351
THAT WE'VE TRIED REALLY HARD

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:49.019
WITH THIS BILL TO THREAD A

02:38:49.086 --> 02:38:50.320
NEEDLE OF PROTECTING THOSE

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:52.055
FORMAL PATIENTS AND ALLOWING

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:53.323
THESE NONPROFIT.

02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:55.058
IF IF IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:57.094
OF THE PATIENT TO ACTUALLY PAY

02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:59.162
THEIR PREMIUMS BUT WHAT WE WANT

02:38:59.229 --> 02:39:00.330
TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.431
DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE ON THE

02:39:01.498 --> 02:39:03.200
BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND

02:39:03.267 --> 02:39:05.135
NOT BASED ON THE BEST INTEREST

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:06.069
OF THE PROVIDER.

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.337
AND SO WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO DO

02:39:07.404 --> 02:39:09.139
IS TAKE OUT THE FINANCIAL

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:10.974
INCENTIVE OF THAT AND LIKE

02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:13.343
DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED WE ALSO

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:15.112
PUT IN PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:16.413
THIS IS NO WAY TO DO UNDER

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:17.881
WRITING THIS IS IN A WAY TO

02:39:17.948 --> 02:39:19.283
SHIFT PEOPLE OFF OF OUR ROLES.

02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:21.051
THIS IS SIMPLY A WAY TO MAKE

02:39:21.118 --> 02:39:22.819
SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:39:22.886 --> 02:39:24.554
ARE BEING SUPPORTED WHO ARE

02:39:24.621 --> 02:39:26.790
BEING SPONSORED TRULY UNDERSTAND

02:39:26.857 --> 02:39:28.392
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PRODUCT

02:39:28.458 --> 02:39:30.694
THEY'RE ON THEY THEY ARE COVERED

02:39:30.761 --> 02:39:32.362
FOR A FULL TWELVE MONTHS OF THE

02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:33.363
PLAN YEAR.

02:39:33.430 --> 02:39:35.666
THAT THE PLANS ARE NOTIFIED WHEN

02:39:35.732 --> 02:39:36.934
THIS HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.535
THIRD OF FINANCIALLY INTERESTED

02:39:38.602 --> 02:39:39.870
THIRD PARTY PAYER.

02:39:39.937 --> 02:39:42.072
AND ALSO LASTLY THAT WE DO YOU

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:43.640
ADDRESS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:44.942
TO ENSURE THAT.

02:39:45.008 --> 02:39:47.010
THOSE WHO WERE WHO WERE ADVISING

02:39:47.077 --> 02:39:48.979
CONSULTING AND HELPING THESE

02:39:49.046 --> 02:39:50.714
PATIENTS ARE DOING IT OUT OF THE

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.316
BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:53.717
NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A FINANCIAL

02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:55.018
INTEREST TO THEM.

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:58.755
AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE AS MANY OF

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:01.558
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR IS

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:02.526
HIGHLIGHTED THAT.

02:40:02.592 --> 02:40:03.860
BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMISSION BASE

02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:04.962
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:05.996
THAT THEY WERE ADVISING PEOPLE

02:40:06.063 --> 02:40:07.831
IN THE BEST INTEREST IF SOMEONE

02:40:07.898 --> 02:40:09.366
WAS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC

02:40:09.433 --> 02:40:11.335
HOW THAT CHOSE TO BE IN A

02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:12.402
COMMERCIAL PLAN.

02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:13.704
THAT AGENT OR BROKER DIDN'T

02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:14.705
RECEIVE A COMMISSION BASED ON

02:40:14.771 --> 02:40:16.239
THAT TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:18.141
REALLY ADVISING PEOPLE BASED ON

02:40:18.208 --> 02:40:19.509
THEIR OWN PERSONAL AND BEST

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:20.377
INTERESTS.

02:40:20.444 --> 02:40:21.611
AND REALLY WE'VE TRIED REALLY

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:23.146

FIRST AND FOREMOST AB TWO NINETY

02:48:34.671 --> 02:48:36.372
COULD JEOPARDIZE.

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:37.941
THE VARIABILITY.

02:48:38.007 --> 02:48:39.509
OF VULNERABLE LOW INCOME

I QUOTE IF AB TWO NINETY IS

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:52.355

02:48:52.422 --> 02:48:54.023

ACCORDING TO THE A. K. F. A. B.

02:48:59.696 --> 02:49:00.230
TWO NINETY WOULD PUT THE A. K.

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:04.334
GUIDANCE.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.668
RATHER THAN RISK THE ENTIRE

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:07.170
NATION WIDE PATIENT BASE THAT

02:49:07.237 --> 02:49:08.505
THEY SERVE.

02:49:08.571 --> 02:49:09.572
THEY WERE CLEAR THAT THEY'D

02:49:09.639 --> 02:49:12.408
LIKELY STOP PROVIDING ASSISTANCE

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:13.576
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:49:13.643 --> 02:49:14.744
THAT MEANS AB TWO NIGHT

OF THESE PATIENTS ARE MINORITY.

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:22.752

INCOME.

02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:25.788
AB TWO NINETY AS A GIFT TO THE

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:27.724
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:28.925
WITH NO REQUIREMENTS THAT

02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:30.193
INSURERS PASS ON ANY OF THE

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.128
SAVINGS.

02:49:32.195 --> 02:49:33.696
IT ALLOWS INSURERS TO ME THE

02:49:33.763 --> 02:49:36.566
MEDICARE RATE. FOR PATIENTS ON

02:49:36.633 --> 02:49:38.001
JOURNAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE.

02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:41.070
WHICH IS BELOW THE COST OF CARE.

02:49:41.137 --> 02:49:42.872
AB TWO NINETY COULD JEOPARDIZE

02:49:42.939 --> 02:49:46.509
ACCESS FOR ALL PATIENTS. 90% OF

02:49:46.576 --> 02:49:48.044
THE PATIENTS.

02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:49.679
ON DIALYSIS.

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:51.614
HAVE INSURANCE FUNDED BY THE

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:53.816
GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT PAY THE

02:49:53.883 --> 02:49:55.418
COST OF CARE.

02:49:55.485 --> 02:49:57.320
IF WE START REDUCING PAYMENTS

02:49:57.387 --> 02:49:58.688
FOR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING

02:49:58.755 --> 02:50:00.857
10% PATIENTS ON PRIVATE PAY.

02:50:00.924 --> 02:50:02.358
IT DISRUPTS THE ENTIRE ECO

02:50:02.425 --> 02:50:03.760
SYSTEM JEOPARDIZING THE

02:50:03.826 --> 02:50:07.230
FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF CLINICS.

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:08.731
WELL PROVIDERS WOULD WORK HARD

02:50:08.798 --> 02:50:10.466
TO PREVENT CLINIC CLOSURES AND

02:50:10.533 --> 02:50:11.501
CUTBACKS.

02:50:11.568 --> 02:50:12.936
DIALYSIS PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:15.204
SLOWING FUTURE EXPANSION PLANS

02:50:15.271 --> 02:50:16.773
IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE

02:50:16.839 --> 02:50:19.842
CONSTANT ATTACK BY INSURERS AND

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:21.844
OTHER SPECIAL INTERESTS.

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:23.513
IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE YEARS.

02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:25.515
FROM THE IDEA TO GET A DIALYSIS

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:28.418
CLINIC ON LINE AND OPERATING.

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:29.686
THE DEMAND FOR DIALYSIS IS

02:50:29.752 --> 02:50:31.888
GROWING IN CALIFORNIA AT 5% PER

02:50:31.955 --> 02:50:34.557
YEAR OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:35.959
WE WILL NEED AN ADDITIONAL THREE

02:50:36.025 --> 02:50:37.360
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIALYSIS

02:50:37.427 --> 02:50:38.828
CLINICS.

02:50:38.895 --> 02:50:39.896
IF AB TWO AND IDEAS PASSED

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:41.631
PATIENTS IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE

02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:43.833
A HARDER TIME GETTING CONVENIENT

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:44.400
ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT THEY

02:50:44.467 --> 02:50:47.236
NEED. THREE DAYS A WEEK FOUR

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.205
HOURS OF TIME. FOR THESE AND

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:50.640
OTHER REASONS WE STRONGLY OPPOSE

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:54.177
THE BILL.

TWO NINE ZERO AB TWO NINE ZERO

PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS.

02:51:13.863 --> 02:51:15.264
IT SETS REIMBURSEMENTS THAT THE

CARE.

02:51:18.401 --> 02:51:19.402
WE ARE CONCERNED THE BILL WILL

02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:21.604
CREATE LONG TERM ACCESS ISSUES

SLOWED BY AS MUCH AS ONE THIRD

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:28.144
DEPENDING ON THE PROVIDER.

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:29.512
WITHOUT RELIABLE ACCESS TO LIFE

02:51:29.579 --> 02:51:31.080
SAVING TREATMENT DIALYSIS

COMPLICATIONS.

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:38.054
THIS WILL BE A MUCH HIGHER COST

02:51:38.121 --> 02:51:38.955
TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAN

RATE REVIEW AND AM ALL OUR

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:49.685
REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO DO

02:58:49.752 --> 02:58:51.554
DISCLOSURES SPA AND LARGE GROUP

02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:53.989
FILINGS SO WITH THOSE YOU WOULD

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:54.924
SEE.

02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:56.659
IF YOU SAW DIRECTORS OLD AND

02:58:56.725 --> 02:58:58.160
REDUCTION OF CLAIMS THAT WOULD

02:58:58.227 --> 02:59:00.129
BE COOL THEN TO WITHIN OUR RATE

02:59:00.196 --> 02:59:01.730
REVIEW PROCESS THE REGULATOR

02:59:01.797 --> 02:59:03.799
WOULD LOOK AT THAT WOULD REDUCE

02:59:03.866 --> 02:59:05.534
WE BELIEVE PREMIUMS TO BOTH RATE

02:59:05.601 --> 02:59:07.470
PAYERS AND CONSUMERS.

02:59:07.536 --> 02:59:09.238
AND THEN YOU WOULD ALSO SEE --

02:59:09.305 --> 02:59:11.173
AS A PART OF THAT I THINK ONE OF

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:13.476
MY PLANS HAS IDENTIFIED THIS AS

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:16.045
POTENTIALLY A 1% INCREASE IN

02:59:16.112 --> 02:59:17.480
PREMIUMS.

02:59:17.546 --> 02:59:19.482
I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PLAN SIMILAR

02:59:19.548 --> 02:59:21.217
TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT --

02:59:21.283 --> 02:59:23.886
WE USE AN EXAMPLE AS OF ABOUT

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:24.420
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:59:24.487 --> 02:59:25.788
DOLLARS OF UNDER WRITTEN PREMIUM

02:59:25.855 --> 02:59:26.789
THAT WAS THE TOTAL THAT THEY

02:59:26.856 --> 02:59:28.390
COLLECTED TO TO COVER FROM

02:59:28.457 --> 02:59:33.162
MATERNITY. TO CANCER TREATMENT

02:59:33.229 --> 02:59:36.232
TO PREVENT IT IS FACE IN A

02:59:36.298 --> 02:59:37.233
SINGLE YEAR.

02:59:37.299 --> 02:59:38.934
SO WITH THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU

02:59:39.001 --> 02:59:40.336
THE REASON WHY THIS IS SUCH A

02:59:40.402 --> 02:59:42.872
HUGE IMPACT TO THE SYSTEM AND TO

02:59:42.938 --> 02:59:44.406
RATE PAYERS.

02:59:44.473 --> 02:59:45.741
I THINK OUR GOAL ALL HERE'S WERE

02:59:45.808 --> 02:59:47.309
VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AND SO WE

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:48.811
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:51.046
DEGREE WE CAN IDENTIFY AREAS

02:59:51.113 --> 02:59:52.381
WHERE THERE IS MANIPULATION OF

02:59:52.448 --> 02:59:53.582
THE SYSTEM --

02:59:53.649 --> 02:59:55.084
WE WANT TO BRING IT TO FOCUS

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:55.985
ATTENTION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:59:56.051 --> 02:59:57.419
ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:59:57.486 --> 02:59:58.587
REAL PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICTS.

02:59:58.654 --> 03:00:00.623
THAT ARE TRYING TO PAY FOR

03:00:00.689 --> 03:00:01.790
HEALTH INSURANCE AND ARE

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:03.259
STRUGGLING AND WE WANT TO MAKE

03:00:03.325 --> 03:00:05.427
SURE THAT WERE THOUGHTFUL AND

03:00:05.494 --> 03:00:06.862
SENSITIVE TO THAT.

03:00:06.929 --> 03:00:07.830
HELLO QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:10.166
BECAUSE WE RURAL AREAS THE LAST

03:00:10.232 --> 03:00:12.635
THING I WANT TO SEE IS AXIS --

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:14.403
DIMINISHED I'VE BEEN TOLD PRETTY

03:00:14.470 --> 03:00:16.172
CLEARLY THAT TAXES WOULDN'T BE

03:00:16.238 --> 03:00:17.373
DIMINISHED.

03:00:17.439 --> 03:00:18.073
AND SO I'M SITTING HERE

03:00:18.140 --> 03:00:19.942
WONDERING YOU KNOW THIS COST

03:00:20.009 --> 03:00:21.877
SHIFT WHERE WARY REALLY GOING

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:23.312
WITH THIS I MEAN WHO IS IT

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:24.914
REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT --

03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:26.348
IT REALLY AT THE LOWER RATES ARE

03:00:26.415 --> 03:00:28.217
WE GOING TO MAKE SURE BENEFIT

03:00:28.284 --> 03:00:30.886
OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES --

03:00:30.953 --> 03:00:32.788
THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS STILL

03:00:32.855 --> 03:00:34.156
HERE BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE

03:00:34.223 --> 03:00:36.659
WE'RE KIND OF GOING.

03:00:36.725 --> 03:00:38.527
WAS A GAME WE HIT THE BALL IT

03:00:38.594 --> 03:00:40.729
OVER HERE.

03:00:40.796 --> 03:00:41.931
AND SO -- I

03:00:41.997 --> 03:00:42.698
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:45.201
RE HAVE ARE PEOPLE TAKING CARE

03:00:45.267 --> 03:00:48.204
OF AND THE CONUNDRUM FOR ME

03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:49.104
RIGHT NOW.

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:50.339
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN COMMENT ON

03:00:50.406 --> 03:00:54.276
THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME --

03:00:54.343 --> 03:00:54.810
TO ONE OF ONE OF THE MAJOR

03:00:54.877 --> 03:00:55.844
DRIVING.

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:57.746
FACTORS THAT CREATES THIS

03:00:57.813 --> 03:01:00.382
PROBLEM IS THE FINANCING FOR

03:01:00.449 --> 03:01:02.117
DIALYSIS IN THIS COUNTRY.

03:01:02.184 --> 03:01:04.687
THE MEDICARE SYSTEM REIMBURSES

03:01:04.753 --> 03:01:06.355
AT A RATE THAT IS LESS THAN.

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:07.756
THE COST OF THE DIALYSIS

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:10.192
TREATMENT. FOR THOSE PATIENTS

03:01:10.259 --> 03:01:12.728
WHO ARE MEDI CAL ONLY AND IN

03:01:12.795 --> 03:01:13.996
PARTICULAR --

03:01:14.063 --> 03:01:16.865
THE THE UNDOCUMENTED PATIENTS

03:01:16.932 --> 03:01:18.734
WHO ARE ON EMERGENCY MEDICAL.

03:01:18.801 --> 03:01:20.469
THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ONLY

03:01:20.536 --> 03:01:22.404
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE

03:01:22.471 --> 03:01:23.339
OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS

03:01:23.405 --> 03:01:24.807
PER TREATMENT THE MEDICARE RATE

03:01:24.873 --> 03:01:26.575
IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

03:01:26.642 --> 03:01:27.343
DOLLARS PER.

03:01:27.409 --> 03:01:28.777
PER TREATMENT AVERAGE.

03:01:28.844 --> 03:01:30.246
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IF WE HAVE A

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:32.448
MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THREE TIMES A

03:01:32.514 --> 03:01:34.683
WEEK WE'RE LOSING SIGNIFICANT

03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:36.452
AMOUNT OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

03:01:36.518 --> 03:01:38.120
OF DOLLARS TO TREAT THAT PATIENT

03:01:38.187 --> 03:01:43.559
AND SO. ONE OR TWO PATIENTS IN A

03:01:43.626 --> 03:01:45.327
DIALYSIS CLINIC TO TAKE USUALLY

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:47.730
IN THE RURAL AREAS OR IN THE

03:01:47.796 --> 03:01:49.932
URBAN CORE WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:51.533
UNINSURED PATIENTS A LOT OF MEDI

03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.302
CAL PATIENTS.

03:01:53.369 --> 03:01:55.404
CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.

03:01:55.471 --> 03:01:58.040
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT CLINIC.

03:01:58.107 --> 03:01:59.842
HE CAN REMAIN OPEN --

03:01:59.908 --> 03:02:01.510
OR WILL NOT REMAIN OPEN OR LET'S

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:04.146
LET'S SAY THEY HAVE REVENUES IN

03:02:04.213 --> 03:02:05.848
EXCESS OF THEIR EXPENSES.

03:02:05.914 --> 03:02:08.384
UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE.

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:10.119
OUR COMPANIES THE NOT FOR PROFIT

03:02:10.185 --> 03:02:11.420
COMPANIES AND THE FOR PROFIT

03:02:11.487 --> 03:02:13.155
COMPANIES CAN USE SOME OF THE

03:02:13.222 --> 03:02:14.523
MONEY THAT THEY MAKE IN OTHER

03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:16.959
AREAS OF THE STATE. TO SUPPORT

03:02:17.026 --> 03:02:18.761
THE IN THE CLINICS IN YOUR

03:02:18.827 --> 03:02:20.262
DISTRICT FRANKLY.

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:22.331
UP UNDER THIS BILL THEY WOULD

03:02:22.398 --> 03:02:23.832
LOSE THOSE.

03:02:23.899 --> 03:02:25.267
PATIENTS THAT --

03:02:25.334 --> 03:02:27.336
BEING REIMBURSED AT THE PRIVATE

03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:27.670
SECTOR RATES.

03:02:27.736 --> 03:02:31.573
WHICH I THOUGHT I MUST ALSO SAY

03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:33.609
ME YOUR BUSINESS PLAN I'M JUST

03:02:33.676 --> 03:02:34.677
YEAH I WAS QUESTION NOT.

03:02:34.743 --> 03:02:36.679
NONE OF THAT'S FINE YOUR

03:02:36.745 --> 03:02:37.913
BUSINESS PLAN PIE TAKES IT INTO

03:02:37.980 --> 03:02:39.315
CONSIDERATION DOESN'T IT I MEAN

03:02:39.381 --> 03:02:40.516
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY

03:02:40.582 --> 03:02:41.617
THAT ARE GOING TO BE MAYBE

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:42.751
UNDOCUMENTED SOME YOU CAN BE

03:02:42.818 --> 03:02:46.055
MEDICARE I MEAN.

03:02:46.121 --> 03:02:46.822
THERE'S A FORMULA THAT YOU.

03:02:46.889 --> 03:02:48.190
THERE IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE.

03:02:48.257 --> 03:02:49.291
THAT THAT THIS BILL WOULD TEAR

03:02:49.358 --> 03:02:51.927
APART.

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:53.696
CAN WE CHANGE INSTRUCTION.

03:02:53.762 --> 03:02:55.230
WELL WE CAN WE CAN INCREASE

03:02:55.297 --> 03:02:56.699
REIMBURSEMENT RATES UNDER THE

03:02:56.765 --> 03:02:58.734
MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE

03:02:58.801 --> 03:03:01.370
ONE IMPORTANT FIRST STEP --

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.872
TO TAKE AND IT.

03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:05.207
YOU KNOW IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM

03:03:05.274 --> 03:03:06.675
WE THOUGHT A WHOLE LOT ABOUT.

03:03:06.742 --> 03:03:08.610
THIS YEAR'S BILL AND AND WE

03:03:08.677 --> 03:03:09.978
DON'T WANT TO OPPOSE THE CHAIRS

03:03:10.045 --> 03:03:11.680
BILL BUT WE SEEM WE FEEL THAT WE

03:03:11.747 --> 03:03:13.015
JUST HAVE NO CHOICE BASED ON THE

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:15.651
PATIENTS AND THE REAL ISSUE IS

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:15.851
THAT.

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:18.987
WE'RE CREATING I MEAN BASED UPON

03:03:19.054 --> 03:03:21.357
ALL OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE'VE

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:23.959
HAD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

03:03:24.026 --> 03:03:26.128
THE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS.

03:03:26.195 --> 03:03:27.663
OR LOOKING AT BUILDING

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:29.798
FACILITIES NOT IN CALIFORNIA

03:03:29.865 --> 03:03:30.833
ANYMORE BUT THEY'RE BUILDING

03:03:30.899 --> 03:03:31.934
THEM IN.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.836
OTHER STATES --

03:03:33.902 --> 03:03:36.772
AND SO WE REALLY I MEAN I THINK

03:03:36.839 --> 03:03:38.607
OR OR ARE --

03:03:38.674 --> 03:03:39.742
PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

03:03:39.808 --> 03:03:42.044
TO KEEP CLINICS OPEN I DON'T I

03:03:42.111 --> 03:03:43.011
DON'T SEE ANY ANY CLINICS THAT

03:03:43.078 --> 03:03:44.380
ARE GONNA CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY

03:03:44.446 --> 03:03:45.914
BUT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW I

03:03:45.981 --> 03:03:47.182
CAN NEVER I CAN ASSURE THAT.

03:03:47.249 --> 03:03:48.550
BUT WE THINK THEY CAN KEEP THEM

03:03:48.617 --> 03:03:49.985
OPEN HOWEVER.

03:03:50.052 --> 03:03:51.220
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A TICKING

03:03:51.286 --> 03:03:52.354
TIME BOMB WHERE.

03:03:52.421 --> 03:03:54.423
COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:57.659
DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA SO FIVE

03:03:57.726 --> 03:03:58.727
SIX SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW.

03:03:58.794 --> 03:04:01.430
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS? FOR

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:03.198
ALL OF THE DIALYSIS PATIENTS AND

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:05.634
BY THE WAY OUR POPULATION

03:04:05.701 --> 03:04:06.735
CALIFORNIA IS A MISTRIAL IN A

03:04:06.802 --> 03:04:07.870
YEAR I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED

03:04:07.936 --> 03:04:09.605
MISS AYE GARCIA CURRY'S QUESTION

03:04:09.671 --> 03:04:11.573
GIVE ANOTHER QUESTION.

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:12.207
DID YOU WANT TO ANSWER AYE AYE

03:04:12.274 --> 03:04:13.675
YEAH I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO DRESS

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:14.777
I'D LIKE TO DRESS UP ON ON A

03:04:14.843 --> 03:04:16.445
COUPLE OF LEVELS FIRST OF ALL.

03:04:16.512 --> 03:04:17.413
I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT THE

03:04:17.479 --> 03:04:19.181
PROFIT FOR DIALYSIS COMPANIES IN

03:04:19.248 --> 03:04:20.816
CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

03:04:20.883 --> 03:04:22.151
MILLION DOLLARS.

03:04:22.217 --> 03:04:26.622
IF WE USE THE THE NUMBERS THAT

03:04:26.688 --> 03:04:29.892
WE HER PROFIT OF FOUR HUNDRED

03:04:29.958 --> 03:04:31.627
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:04:31.693 --> 03:04:32.995
CALIFORNIA ALONE.

03:04:33.061 --> 03:04:35.397
SO I DON'T SEE HOW THAT.

03:04:35.464 --> 03:04:37.166
STILL PROFITABLE FOUR HUNDRED

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:38.801
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS LEADS TO

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:40.636
THE CLOSURE OF OF CLINICS I

03:04:40.702 --> 03:04:42.204
DON'T AYE AYE THAT NO ONE HAS

03:04:42.271 --> 03:04:43.772
REALLY EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.

03:04:43.839 --> 03:04:46.608
AS FAR AS THE EXPANSION PLANS --

03:04:46.675 --> 03:04:49.478
FOR THE FUTURE CMS IN IN

03:04:49.545 --> 03:04:52.448
WASHINGTON IS LOOKING AT THE

03:04:52.514 --> 03:04:53.615
COST OF DIED OF DELIVERING

03:04:53.682 --> 03:04:55.184
DIALYSIS CARE IS ACTUALLY

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.485
LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OF

03:04:56.552 --> 03:04:58.420
PROVIDING CARE TO PEOPLE WHO

03:04:58.487 --> 03:04:59.888
HAVE END STAGE RENAL DISEASE.

03:04:59.955 --> 03:05:01.890
THAT MAY NOT INVOLVE --

03:05:01.957 --> 03:05:04.226
DIALYSIS AND ALSO I BELIEVE WE

03:05:04.293 --> 03:05:05.527
OUGHT TO BE REALLY FOCUSING ON

03:05:05.594 --> 03:05:07.830
HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE TO

03:05:07.896 --> 03:05:08.964
TRANSPLANTS.

03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:10.632
KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS MAKING SURE

03:05:10.699 --> 03:05:13.469
THEY KNOW THEIR OPTIONS UP FRONT

03:05:13.535 --> 03:05:18.407
EARLY ON BECAUSE TRANSPLANTS.

03:05:18.474 --> 03:05:19.141
SAVE LIVES.

03:05:19.208 --> 03:05:19.875
YOU CAN EVEN YOU HAVE TO YOU

03:05:19.942 --> 03:05:20.642
COULD GET OUT MUCH HEALTHIER

03:05:20.709 --> 03:05:22.444
LIFE FOR FOR TEN OR MORE YEARS --

03:05:22.511 --> 03:05:24.313
FROM A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AT A

03:05:24.379 --> 03:05:26.315
READ AT A STATE A SIMILAR COST

03:05:26.381 --> 03:05:27.749
OR EVEN LESS THAN WHAT WE WENT

03:05:27.816 --> 03:05:29.251
WITH THE WITH DIALYSIS AND THAT

03:05:29.318 --> 03:05:30.652
PERSON WOULD NOT HAVE.

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:32.721
TO HAVE TO BE HAVE TREATMENT

03:05:32.788 --> 03:05:34.523
THREE TIMES A WEEK SO SO THERE

03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:36.091
ARE OTHER THINGS AT PLAY HERE

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:37.392
AND SO AS FAR AS THE FUTURE

03:05:37.459 --> 03:05:39.261
EXPANSION PLANS SOME OF THAT I

03:05:39.328 --> 03:05:40.829
BELIEVE IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE

03:05:40.896 --> 03:05:42.297
FACT THAT CMS IS LOOKING.

03:05:42.364 --> 03:05:43.665
AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DOING

03:05:43.732 --> 03:05:44.900
TREATMENT --

03:05:44.967 --> 03:05:47.870
IN HONG KONG FOR EXAMPLE 70% OF

03:05:47.936 --> 03:05:50.606
THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE DIALYSIS

03:05:50.672 --> 03:05:51.773
RECEIVE IT AT HOME.

03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:53.509
NOT IN A CLINIC AND THERE ARE

03:05:53.575 --> 03:05:54.977
MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF WAYS THE

03:05:55.043 --> 03:05:56.512
WAY THE TREATMENT OF END STAGE

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:58.080
RENAL DISEASE IS CHANGING AND

03:05:58.146 --> 03:05:58.947
AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND

03:05:59.014 --> 03:06:01.917
ACROSS THE AND THAT'S AND THAT

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:03.252
SO I BELIEVE THAT HAS A HAS A

03:06:03.318 --> 03:06:04.853
FACTOR OF WHY THESE ARE.

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:06.688
THESE THESE PLANS THESE

03:06:06.755 --> 03:06:08.090
EXPANSION PLANS MAY BE SLOWING

03:06:08.156 --> 03:06:08.290

PATIENTS --

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:45.580
THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

03:08:45.647 --> 03:08:47.716
BASED ON AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

03:08:47.783 --> 03:08:49.484
GENERAL DECISION THAT WAS MADE

03:08:49.551 --> 03:08:51.053
IN.

03:08:51.119 --> 03:08:51.687
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THAT IS AN

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:52.888
ARGUMENT THAT DID NOT COME UP

03:08:52.954 --> 03:08:54.623
LAST YEAR AND WE JUST LEARNED OF

03:08:54.690 --> 03:08:56.825
THAT RECENTLY AND I STILL AM TO

03:08:56.892 --> 03:08:58.093
THIS DAY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

03:08:58.160 --> 03:08:58.860
THAT TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD

03:08:58.927 --> 03:09:00.162
DECISION.

03:09:00.228 --> 03:09:01.830
AFFECTS THIS BILL BECAUSE AS FAR

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:03.031
AS I KNOW THE AG IS NOT WEIGHED

03:09:03.098 --> 03:09:05.600
IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING --

03:09:05.667 --> 03:09:08.036
I AS FAR AS PROFITS FOR

03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:09.838
INSURANCE PLANS INSURANCE PLANS

03:09:09.905 --> 03:09:11.540
ARE HIGHLY REGULATED --

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:15.043
THEY HAVE A CAP ON THEIR PROFITS --

03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:17.846
AND THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY HAS A

03:09:17.913 --> 03:09:19.514
VERY HIGH PROFIT MARGIN IT'S

03:09:19.581 --> 03:09:21.583
ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN MANY MANY

03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:22.851
SECTORS OF THE OF THE HEALTH

03:09:22.918 --> 03:09:24.019
CARE SPACE RIGHT NOW.

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:25.587
SO THEY ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF

03:09:25.654 --> 03:09:26.655
DOLLARS --

03:09:26.722 --> 03:09:31.093
AND AND AND PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

03:09:31.159 --> 03:09:33.862
THEY'RE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION.

03:09:33.929 --> 03:09:35.097
TO THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN FOR

03:09:35.163 --> 03:09:36.798
WHICH THEY'RE GETTING A TAX

03:09:36.865 --> 03:09:37.099
[inaudible]

03:09:37.165 --> 03:09:39.501
DEDUCTION.

03:09:39.568 --> 03:09:41.103
AND THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THE

03:09:41.169 --> 03:09:42.170
AMERICAN CAN BE FUN.

03:09:42.237 --> 03:09:43.572
PAYING FOR INSURANCE PREMIUMS

03:09:43.638 --> 03:09:45.207
THAT REIMBURSE THEM AT THREE OR

03:09:45.273 --> 03:09:46.341
FOUR TIMES THE RATE FOR MEDI CAL

03:09:46.408 --> 03:09:48.343
SO THEY'RE GETTING TO KIND OF

03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:49.778
DOUBLE DIPPING [inaudible]

03:09:49.845 --> 03:09:52.914

WHATEVER THAT 20% THAT MEDICARE

03:10:01.089 --> 03:10:02.891
AND THE PHONE WILL STILL BE ABLE

03:10:02.958 --> 03:10:04.493
TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THERE'S

03:10:04.559 --> 03:10:05.193
NOTHING PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.995
THAT I THINK SO I WON IT FIRST

03:10:07.062 --> 03:10:07.996
OF ALL THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU

03:10:08.063 --> 03:10:08.930

03:10:08.997 --> 03:10:10.632
SOME TIME WITH ME AND ADDRESSED

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:11.967
A LOT OF MY CONCERNS BECAUSE I

03:10:12.033 --> 03:10:14.202
DO HAVE OVER HALF MY DISTRICT IS

03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:16.938
ON MEDI CAL. 60% OF MY DISTRICT

03:10:17.005 --> 03:10:18.340
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WE

03:10:18.406 --> 03:10:20.142
SUFFER GREATLY I HAVE THREE

03:10:20.208 --> 03:10:22.310
TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE --

03:10:22.377 --> 03:10:23.678
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREEL HAS --

03:10:23.745 --> 03:10:25.881
IN HER DISTRICT ON THIS PROGRAM

03:10:25.947 --> 03:10:29.484
SO THE THOSE FOLKS BUT FOR ME AS

03:10:29.551 --> 03:10:31.486
I HAVE EXPRESSED TO YOU AND TO

03:10:31.553 --> 03:10:35.357
THE SUPPORTERS AND OPPOSITION --

03:10:35.423 --> 03:10:37.559
LISTEN I I KNOW THERE IS SOME I

03:10:37.626 --> 03:10:38.927
HATE TO SAY THIS I KNOW THERE IS

03:10:38.994 --> 03:10:41.062
SOME DISDAIN FOR THE OWNERS OF

03:10:41.129 --> 03:10:42.964
SOME OF THESE CLINICS AND I

03:10:43.031 --> 03:10:44.933
DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THAT --

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:46.001
AND I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

03:10:46.067 --> 03:10:47.502
BEEN ATTACKS ON SEVERAL LEVELS

03:10:47.569 --> 03:10:49.271
ON THE CLINICS I ACTUALLY DON'T

03:10:49.337 --> 03:10:50.605
CARE ABOUT THAT EITHER.

03:10:50.672 --> 03:10:52.507
WHAT I DO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT

03:10:52.574 --> 03:10:53.775
IS I LIVE IN A DISTRICT WHERE

03:10:53.842 --> 03:10:56.044
PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED AND AS

03:10:56.111 --> 03:10:57.913
THIS AS RENEE CAN TELL YOU CHECK

03:10:57.979 --> 03:10:58.914
IT'S ONE THING TO BE FISCALLY

03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:00.382
CHALLENGED IT'S ANOTHER THING TO

03:11:00.448 --> 03:11:02.350
DO THAT AND THEN DO YOUR

03:11:02.417 --> 03:11:03.819
DIALYSIS OVERNIGHT?

03:11:03.885 --> 03:11:05.086
A BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THAT'S THE

03:11:05.153 --> 03:11:06.555
ONLY TIME YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT

03:11:06.621 --> 03:11:08.990
AND THAT'S AND RIGHT NOW MY

03:11:09.057 --> 03:11:10.392
FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO CLINICS.

03:11:10.458 --> 03:11:11.526
SO I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED

03:11:11.593 --> 03:11:13.495
ABOUT THE CONSISTENT ATTACKS ON

03:11:13.562 --> 03:11:15.363
THE DIALYSIS CLINICS BECAUSE MY

03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:16.765
FOLKS CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE ELSE

03:11:16.832 --> 03:11:18.333
THEY CAN'T TAKE THREE BUSES THEY

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:19.868
LOSE THEIR JOB AND QUITE FRANKLY

03:11:19.935 --> 03:11:21.236
WITH THE TRANSPLANT THEY LOSE

03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:22.337
THEIR JOB.

03:11:22.404 --> 03:11:24.906
AND SO I JUST MY CONCERN AND

03:11:24.973 --> 03:11:26.007
IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:27.776
ANYTHING ELSE IS AS WE CONTINUE

03:11:27.843 --> 03:11:31.813
I I LOOK FORWARD TO ALTERNATIVE

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:32.714
METHODS OF TREATING.

03:11:32.781 --> 03:11:34.149
END STAGE RENAL DISEASE I REALLY

03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:36.618
DO BUT UNTIL THAT TIME I JUST

03:11:36.685 --> 03:11:38.587
WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR WITH

03:11:38.653 --> 03:11:40.755
EVERYBODY OF THE SUPPORTERS AND

03:11:40.822 --> 03:11:42.757
THE OPPOSITION THAT. FOR ME I

03:11:42.824 --> 03:11:44.392
WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT

03:11:44.459 --> 03:11:46.261
I AM I GO TO MY REAL CLINICS

03:11:46.328 --> 03:11:47.662
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY AND

03:11:47.729 --> 03:11:49.297
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY

03:11:49.364 --> 03:11:50.031
DISTRICT HAVE TO USE THEM.

03:11:50.098 --> 03:11:51.766
I GO REGULARLY DURING MY BREAK I

03:11:51.833 --> 03:11:55.837
GO TO TWO OR THREE AND I I WILL

03:11:55.904 --> 03:11:57.973
FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE THE IF AT

03:11:58.039 --> 03:12:00.408
ANY POINT THAT I FIND I BELIEVE

03:12:00.475 --> 03:12:00.942
IN THE SHORT TERM THEY'RE

03:12:01.009 --> 03:12:01.443
KNOCKING CLOSE.

03:12:01.509 --> 03:12:02.777
BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:12:02.844 --> 03:12:05.146
LONG TERM AND I A WILL WATCH ALL

03:12:05.213 --> 03:12:07.382
OF THESE BILLS CAREFULLY THAT

03:12:07.449 --> 03:12:08.884
HAVE TO DO WITH EIGHT AND STAGE

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:10.585
RENAL DISEASE BECAUSE MY

03:12:10.652 --> 03:12:12.654
DISTRICTS AWFUL SO BAD FROM IT --

03:12:12.721 --> 03:12:15.023
IF I START TO SEE DISTRICTS SEE

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:16.291
RENAL IF I SEARCH SEE SOME OF

03:12:16.358 --> 03:12:17.225
THESE PLACES BECAUSE OF MY

03:12:17.292 --> 03:12:18.159
DISTRICT I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

03:12:18.226 --> 03:12:19.494
GOING TO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS

03:12:19.561 --> 03:12:20.996
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION --

03:12:21.062 --> 03:12:22.697
I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU HAVE

03:12:22.764 --> 03:12:24.132
DONE SO FAR I APPRECIATE THE

03:12:24.199 --> 03:12:25.267
TIME YOU'VE SPENT TO HAVE THIS

03:12:25.333 --> 03:12:26.801
CONVERSATION WITH ME AND I KNOW

03:12:26.868 --> 03:12:28.670
YOU KNOW I AM I AM VERY SERIOUS

03:12:28.737 --> 03:12:29.371
ABOUT THIS.

03:12:29.437 --> 03:12:30.505
BUT I STATE ABOUT THE SUPPORT

03:12:30.572 --> 03:12:32.574
OPPOSITION I JUST TRY I JUST

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.075
WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOME

03:12:34.142 --> 03:12:35.343
PEOPLE LIKE RENE.

03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:37.879
WHO WHO REALLY THIS IS THE NEXT

03:12:37.946 --> 03:12:39.848
LEVEL OF SUFFERING TO WORK IN

03:12:39.915 --> 03:12:41.016
SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THEY WORK

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:42.717
AND AND THEN TO HAVE TO GO? TO

03:12:42.784 --> 03:12:47.122
SIT FOR FOUR HOURS OR OVERNIGHT

03:12:47.188 --> 03:12:48.556
FOR IT'S EXHAUSTING.

03:12:48.623 --> 03:12:49.658
AND I JUST HOPE FOR THINKING

03:12:49.724 --> 03:12:51.259
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE FOLKS FAR

03:12:51.326 --> 03:12:52.460
BEFORE THE TIME WE'RE THINKING

03:12:52.527 --> 03:12:53.929
ABOUT WHETHER --

03:12:53.995 --> 03:12:55.030
ANY OF THESE FACILITIES ARE

03:12:55.096 --> 03:12:57.966
PROFITABLE OR WHETHER YOU ARE

03:12:58.033 --> 03:13:01.369
PROFITABLE INSURANCE AGENCY.

03:13:01.436 --> 03:13:03.605
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AT ALL --

03:13:03.672 --> 03:13:05.573
MISTER RAMOS.

03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:07.309
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR STILL A

03:13:07.375 --> 03:13:09.077
COUPLE QUESTIONS ON ANALYSIS

03:13:09.144 --> 03:13:10.245
THAT -- CAME

03:13:10.312 --> 03:13:11.880
OUT FROM THE COMMITTEE ON ON ON

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:13.048
HOW.

03:13:13.114 --> 03:13:14.816
ON PAGE FIVE THERE'S A A

03:13:14.883 --> 03:13:17.185
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE OF THE BILL.

03:13:17.252 --> 03:13:18.586
IT SAYS THAT --

03:13:18.653 --> 03:13:20.188
MAY BE VERY PATIENTS AWAY FROM

03:13:20.255 --> 03:13:22.490
MEDICARE AND THAT STATEMENT MAY

03:13:22.557 --> 03:13:23.992
BE HAVE WE SOLIDIFIED OUR

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:27.162
VALIDATED THAT STATEMENT AT ALL

03:13:27.228 --> 03:13:27.462
[inaudible]

03:13:27.529 --> 03:13:28.296
UGH.

03:13:28.363 --> 03:13:30.031
IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT TO

03:13:30.098 --> 03:13:32.033
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:35.570
CLINICS AND BUT WE N A SOMEBODY

03:13:35.637 --> 03:13:39.240
ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THAT BUT

03:13:39.307 --> 03:13:40.875
THAT'S PARTIALLY JUST A

03:13:40.942 --> 03:13:42.444
TECHNICAL LANGUAGE THAT IN NOT

03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:43.878
ALL CASES IS ITS STEERING A

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:44.579
PATIENT.

03:13:44.646 --> 03:13:46.047
OFF OF A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:48.416
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF A

03:13:48.483 --> 03:13:50.785
PATIENT IS STILL EMPLOYED ONE

03:13:50.852 --> 03:13:52.320
THEY START DIALYSIS.

03:13:52.387 --> 03:13:54.322
THEN SOMEONE FROM THE CLINIC

03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:55.924
WILL GO TO THAT PATIENT.

03:13:55.991 --> 03:13:59.294
AND SAY TO THEM YOU CAN APPLY

03:13:59.361 --> 03:14:00.295
FOR A GRANT FROM THE FROM THE

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:01.663
AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND TO PAY YOUR

03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:04.332
PREMIUMS INSTEAD OF GOING ON TO

03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:06.067
A PUBLIC PROGRAM.

03:14:06.134 --> 03:14:07.335
AND SO IT'S IT'S HOLDING

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:09.437
PATIENTS ON COMMERCIAL COVERAGE

03:14:09.504 --> 03:14:10.505
WHEN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:11.973
BEEN EL ELIGIBLE TO GO ON TO

03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:13.108
MEDICARE.

03:14:13.174 --> 03:14:15.443
AND AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE LINE

03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:17.078
GETS A LITTLE BIT BLURRED BUT WE

03:14:17.145 --> 03:14:19.280
HAVE DOCUMENTED CASES.

03:14:19.347 --> 03:14:20.782
WHERE PATIENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:23.151
ENROLLED IN FULL SCOPE MEDIC HAL?

03:14:23.218 --> 03:14:24.085
WERE.

03:14:24.152 --> 03:14:28.556
ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE --

03:14:28.623 --> 03:14:30.492
WHILE THEY WERE STILL IT IN SO

03:14:30.558 --> 03:14:32.027
ADDING A FULL SCOPE COVERAGE

03:14:32.093 --> 03:14:34.796
PLAN ON TOP OF THEIR MEDI CAL.

03:14:34.863 --> 03:14:36.898
SO WE'VE SEEN BOTH HOLDING

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:38.433
PATIENTS FROM GOING ON TO

03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:39.701
GOVERNMENT PLANS.

03:14:39.768 --> 03:14:41.703
AS WELL AS MOVING PATIENTS FROM

03:14:41.770 --> 03:14:44.005
A GOVERNMENT PLAN ON TO A

03:14:44.072 --> 03:14:45.073
COMMERCIAL PLAN.

03:14:45.140 --> 03:14:47.208
SO WITH THAT STATEMENT AS FAR AS

03:14:47.275 --> 03:14:48.743
MAY BE VERY PATIENT TO SAY IT'S

03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:50.945
NOT A 100% SO THERE IS SOME.

03:14:51.012 --> 03:14:52.347
SOME.

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:56.051
WAY AS FAR AND PROFIT NUMBERS

03:14:56.117 --> 03:14:57.285
THAT WERE JUST QUOTED --

03:14:57.352 --> 03:14:59.120
BY THE AUTHOR THEN IF THAT'S THE

03:14:59.187 --> 03:15:00.455
CASE OF SOME OF THOSE --

03:15:00.522 --> 03:15:02.057
NUMBERS THAT WERE QUOTED WOULD

03:15:02.123 --> 03:15:04.426
BE FLUID ALSO BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

03:15:04.492 --> 03:15:05.794
100% RIGHT.

03:15:05.860 --> 03:15:08.763
IF I'M SEEING IT RIGHT.

03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:09.898
I THINK IT THE THE PROFIT NUMBER

03:15:09.964 --> 03:15:11.066
CERTAINLY THE THE PROFIT NUMBER

03:15:11.132 --> 03:15:14.035
THAT THE COMPANY REPORTS IS --

03:15:14.102 --> 03:15:16.538
FOR THE STATE IS IS IS AVAILABLE

03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:17.005
TO THEIR SCHOOL THEIR

03:15:17.072 --> 03:15:17.972
SHAREHOLDERS.

03:15:18.039 --> 03:15:19.007
OUT THERE --

03:15:19.074 --> 03:15:20.308
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD

03:15:20.375 --> 03:15:22.243
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BE SAVED

03:15:22.310 --> 03:15:24.512
HERE IS IS PART OF WHAT IS WE'RE

03:15:24.579 --> 03:15:26.815
NOT EXACTLY SURE OF BUT BECAUSE

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:30.051
YOU'RE EXTRAPOLATING THE NUMBERS --

03:15:30.118 --> 03:15:31.820
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

03:15:31.886 --> 03:15:33.321
ONE COMPANY TALK TO THEIR TALK

03:15:33.388 --> 03:15:35.090
TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS SO SO IT

03:15:35.156 --> 03:15:36.691
IS A IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET

03:15:36.758 --> 03:15:38.026
EXACT PANEL ON THAT.

03:15:38.093 --> 03:15:40.495
BUT BUT IF THAT IS ONE OF THE

03:15:40.562 --> 03:15:41.930
MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY

03:15:41.996 --> 03:15:44.666
AND THAT BEING THE CASE IT'S I

03:15:44.732 --> 03:15:46.067
THINK IT'S FAIRLY REASONABLE TO

03:15:46.134 --> 03:15:48.002
EXTRACT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE.

03:15:48.069 --> 03:15:49.370
NONPROFIT CLINICS THAT ARE

03:15:49.437 --> 03:15:52.073
PROVIDING SERVICES WELL SO I

03:15:52.140 --> 03:15:53.541
THINK BELIEVE THE TWO MAJOR --

03:15:53.608 --> 03:15:54.976
COMMERCIAL --

03:15:55.043 --> 03:15:57.345
PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES --

03:15:57.412 --> 03:16:00.949
ARE -- SAID

03:16:01.015 --> 03:16:01.749
OF THE MARKET ROUGHLY

03:16:01.816 --> 03:16:02.050
[inaudible]

03:16:02.117 --> 03:16:05.687
SO.

03:16:05.753 --> 03:16:07.355
HI IF I MIGHT --

03:16:07.422 --> 03:16:09.090
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:16:09.157 --> 03:16:10.792
THE QUESTION OF STEERING HAS

03:16:10.859 --> 03:16:13.428
BEEN RAISED.

03:16:13.495 --> 03:16:15.763
THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IS ONE OF

03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:17.365
THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED

03:16:17.432 --> 03:16:18.500
INDUSTRIES IN THE NATION.

03:16:18.566 --> 03:16:20.535
ERROR HERE ARE THE CONDITIONS

03:16:20.602 --> 03:16:21.636
FOR COVERAGE.

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:23.371
THAT WERE ADOPTED AT THE FEDERAL

03:16:23.438 --> 03:16:24.906
LEVEL BY CMS.

03:16:24.973 --> 03:16:26.374
IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A

03:16:26.441 --> 03:16:28.309
MEDICARE PROVIDER AND 80% OF OUR

03:16:28.376 --> 03:16:30.512
PATIENTS ARE MEDICARE PATIENTS

03:16:30.578 --> 03:16:31.479
SO YOU HAVE TO BE A MEDICARE

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:32.647
PROVIDER IN ORDER TO BE

03:16:32.714 --> 03:16:33.815
SUCCESSFUL.

03:16:33.882 --> 03:16:35.016
YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

03:16:35.083 --> 03:16:36.784
CONDITIONS FOR COVERAGE THE

03:16:36.851 --> 03:16:38.086
CONDITIONS FOR COVERAGE HAVE

03:16:38.153 --> 03:16:39.387
MANY MANY --

03:16:39.454 --> 03:16:42.857
PROVISIONS RELATING.

03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:44.192
TO MANDATES THAT YOU PROVIDE

03:16:44.259 --> 03:16:47.228
YOUR PATIENTS WITH INFORMATION

03:16:47.295 --> 03:16:48.429
ABOUT INSURANCE OPTIONS.

03:16:48.496 --> 03:16:50.765
BUT ALSO PROHIBITING ANY

03:16:50.832 --> 03:16:52.600
STEERING ACTIVITY BY THE

03:16:52.667 --> 03:16:55.703
DIALYSIS FACILITIES SO WE FLATLY

03:16:55.770 --> 03:16:57.372
REJECT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE

03:16:57.438 --> 03:16:59.574
STEERING PATIENTS AND AND IN

03:16:59.641 --> 03:17:00.742
PARTICULAR WE WOULD NEVER STEER

03:17:00.808 --> 03:17:02.610
PATIENT OFF OF A MEDICARE

03:17:02.677 --> 03:17:04.078
PROGRAM BECAUSE THE COST OF

03:17:04.145 --> 03:17:05.413
MONEY IF THEY EVER GET BACK ON

03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:07.015
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS.

03:17:07.081 --> 03:17:10.251
WE FACE IS A VERY COMPLICATED

03:17:10.318 --> 03:17:12.020
REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND

03:17:12.086 --> 03:17:13.821
SO YOU SORT OF TO SORT THROUGH

03:17:13.888 --> 03:17:15.390
THE MALL BUT WHEN YOU TAKE WHEN

03:17:15.456 --> 03:17:16.491
YOU TAKE.

03:17:16.558 --> 03:17:17.926
WHEN YOU PULL THE PIECES STRING

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:20.328
AND AND TAKE ALL THIS MONEY AWAY

03:17:20.395 --> 03:17:22.030
FROM PROVIDERS AND PUT IT IN THE

03:17:22.096 --> 03:17:24.299
HANDS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY?

03:17:24.365 --> 03:17:25.533
YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THERE'S

03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:26.801
GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF ADVERSE

03:17:26.868 --> 03:17:28.536
AFFECT ON PATIENTS AND THAT'S

03:17:28.603 --> 03:17:30.038
OUR CONCERN THANK YOU MISTER

03:17:30.104 --> 03:17:31.673
CHAIRMAN MORE QUESTIONS WAS ROSS

03:17:31.739 --> 03:17:32.874
YEAH I HAVE A RATHER MISTER

03:17:32.941 --> 03:17:33.875
CHAIR -- AND

03:17:33.942 --> 03:17:35.343
ALSO IN THE BACK OF MATERIAL IT

03:17:35.410 --> 03:17:36.411
TALKS ABOUT --

03:17:36.477 --> 03:17:38.846
CMS AND AND A RULING --

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:41.583
THERE WAS MOVING FORWARD BUT

03:17:41.649 --> 03:17:43.051
THEN --

03:17:43.117 --> 03:17:44.018
ENDED UP BEING --

03:17:44.085 --> 03:17:45.119
CHALLENGED --

03:17:45.186 --> 03:17:47.121
AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER CMX

03:17:47.188 --> 03:17:48.690
WILL MOVE FOR WITH THIS RULE IS

03:17:48.756 --> 03:17:50.058
THERE AN UPDATE ON THAT AND

03:17:50.124 --> 03:17:52.460
THAT'S ON PAGE SIX THE SECOND

03:17:52.527 --> 03:17:53.728
PARAGRAPH.

03:17:53.795 --> 03:17:54.929
YES THAT SAID THE IT APPEARS

03:17:54.996 --> 03:17:56.197
THAT THE THE THE CURRENT

03:17:56.264 --> 03:17:57.298
ADMINISTRATION FUHRMAN'S RATIONS

03:17:57.365 --> 03:17:58.933
ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:00.635
DIRECTION AWAY FROM.

03:18:00.702 --> 03:18:01.769
AWAY FROM THAT.

03:18:01.836 --> 03:18:03.271
BUT THOSE THAT BROUGHT THAT IN

03:18:03.338 --> 03:18:04.939
THE INDUSTRY THAT'S THERE IS OUR

03:18:05.006 --> 03:18:06.174
WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO TALK

03:18:06.241 --> 03:18:09.010
OR EVEN DISCUSS EVEN OF THOSE

03:18:09.077 --> 03:18:10.278
PARAMETERS THAT WERE THERE.

03:18:10.345 --> 03:18:13.715
POSSIBLY AFTER.

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:14.249
TWENTY TWENTY WELL THE THE

FAR AS TRYING TO SEE OF THE

03:18:17.418 --> 03:18:18.019
INDUSTRY.

03:18:18.086 --> 03:18:21.256
IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE --

03:18:21.322 --> 03:18:23.258
AREAS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED UNDER

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:24.826
THIS RULE --

03:18:24.892 --> 03:18:26.794

THANK YOU AND GET INTO THE THE

03:18:38.306 --> 03:18:39.741

OF AS FAR AS THOSE THAT THAT ARE

03:18:42.043 --> 03:18:43.444
IN THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW.

03:18:43.511 --> 03:18:45.580
WE HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH

03:18:45.647 --> 03:18:47.115
THAT WITH A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY.

03:18:47.181 --> 03:18:49.417
WHO FIRST IT WAS DIAGNOSED LIFE

03:18:49.484 --> 03:18:51.019
CHANGES RIGHT NOW AND YOU HAVE

03:18:51.085 --> 03:18:52.720
TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE FAMILY

03:18:52.787 --> 03:18:54.889
COMES IN AND AND TO GET SOME?

03:18:54.956 --> 03:18:56.491
THE CONSULTATION THAT'S THERE

03:18:56.557 --> 03:18:57.892
AND HE GOES THROUGH THE

03:18:57.959 --> 03:18:59.160
DIFFERENT --

03:18:59.227 --> 03:19:01.029
ASPECTS THE EFFECTS ON LIFE THE

03:19:01.095 --> 03:19:02.964
EATING THE THE DIETARY ALL THOSE

03:19:03.031 --> 03:19:05.233
THINGS --

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.603
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAS TO GO

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:10.638
TO ONE OF THESE CLINICS --

03:19:10.705 --> 03:19:12.206
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

03:19:12.273 --> 03:19:15.910
AND IF YOU MISS THAT APPOINTMENT.

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:17.412
YOU HAVE TO EITHER MAKE IT UP

03:19:17.478 --> 03:19:19.213
ANOTHER DAY OR THIS OR SOMETIMES

03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:21.582
YOU HAVE TO GO FROM ONE PLACE TO

03:19:21.649 --> 03:19:22.984
ANOTHER.

03:19:23.051 --> 03:19:26.054
RIGHT SO THAT THE THE QUESTION

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.122
THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AS FAR AS

03:19:28.189 --> 03:19:29.490
WILL THIS AFFECT --

03:19:29.557 --> 03:19:32.126
THOSE FACILITIES THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:19:32.193 --> 03:19:33.561
BEING ABLE TO GO TO DURING THAT

03:19:33.628 --> 03:19:34.696
TIME.

03:19:34.762 --> 03:19:36.531
IS SOMETHING OF A CONCERN --

03:19:36.597 --> 03:19:38.132
ALSO TO MYSELF.

03:19:38.199 --> 03:19:39.634
GOING THROUGH THAT AND MAKING

03:19:39.701 --> 03:19:40.968
SURE THAT AND IF YOU MISS THE

03:19:41.035 --> 03:19:42.804
APPOINTMENT YOU GOTTA GO AND TRY

03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:44.739
TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE.

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:46.641
OR BECAUSE LIFE IS ON THE LINE.

03:19:46.708 --> 03:19:48.142
THEN AFTER THAT MOVES FOR IF

03:19:48.209 --> 03:19:50.311
YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH YOU'RE ABLE

03:19:50.378 --> 03:19:52.146
TO GET THE EQUIPMENT AND START

03:19:52.213 --> 03:19:53.781
TO HAVE THE PROCESS DONE AT HOME.

03:19:53.848 --> 03:19:55.316
OVER NIGHT OR SOMETIME DURING

03:19:55.383 --> 03:19:56.584
THE DAY.

03:19:56.651 --> 03:19:59.887
AND YOUR HONOR A LIST --

03:19:59.954 --> 03:20:03.057
FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANT THINGS ARE

03:20:03.124 --> 03:20:04.892
BEING WAITED IN MY MIND AS FAR

03:20:04.959 --> 03:20:06.794
AS WHICH DIRECTION I WILL GO ON

03:20:06.861 --> 03:20:08.096
THIS BILL.

03:20:08.162 --> 03:20:09.597
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT WHEN WE

03:20:09.664 --> 03:20:12.100
START TALKING ABOUT THE AFFECT

03:20:12.166 --> 03:20:13.634
OF POSSIBLY CLOSING.

03:20:13.701 --> 03:20:17.438
ANY OF THE AREAS THAT SERVICES --

03:20:17.505 --> 03:20:19.741
BECOMES A CONCERN FOR ME AND SEE

03:20:19.807 --> 03:20:21.109
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MOVING

03:20:21.175 --> 03:20:22.744
FORWARD --

03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:24.345
BUT THEN SITTING BACK DOWN WITH

03:20:24.412 --> 03:20:26.013
THE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO SEE IF

03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:27.915
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

03:20:27.982 --> 03:20:30.318
LOOKED AT AS FAR AS MOVING

03:20:30.385 --> 03:20:31.819
FORWARD --

03:20:31.886 --> 03:20:32.854
TO WEAR THIS BILL COULD OFF

03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:34.222
ULTIMATELY BE.

03:20:34.288 --> 03:20:35.757
ALSO -- WAY

03:20:35.823 --> 03:20:37.725
STRONG AND IN MY POSITION SO I

03:20:37.792 --> 03:20:39.060
CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO

03:20:39.127 --> 03:20:40.294
HEARING ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS

03:20:40.361 --> 03:20:42.063
FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS

03:20:42.130 --> 03:20:44.332
THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT I'M STILL.

03:20:44.399 --> 03:20:44.966
THINKING PRETTY HARD ABOUT THIS

03:20:45.032 --> 03:20:48.770
BILL.

03:20:48.836 --> 03:20:51.439
THE US ROMANCE --

03:20:51.506 --> 03:20:53.608
SOME MEMBER WALDRON.

03:20:53.674 --> 03:20:55.843
THANK YOU --

03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:56.477
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT

03:20:56.544 --> 03:20:57.545
SERIOUSLY WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME

03:20:57.612 --> 03:20:59.981
ON BECAUSE THERE'S PROS THERE'S

03:21:00.047 --> 03:21:00.748
CONS.

03:21:00.815 --> 03:21:02.316
I MEAN BACK AND FORTH YOU CAN'T

03:21:02.383 --> 03:21:05.253
REALLY COME TO A SOLID DECISION

03:21:05.319 --> 03:21:07.855
A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE ONE PART

03:21:07.922 --> 03:21:09.357
ONE GROUP SAYS ONE THING AND

03:21:09.424 --> 03:21:10.792
SOMEONE ELSE'S ANOTHER.

03:21:10.858 --> 03:21:12.627
AND I'VE I'VE GOT KIND OF A LIST

03:21:12.693 --> 03:21:14.395
OF THINGS AND I WON'T GO THROUGH

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:16.664
ALL OF THEM BECAUSE WE OFFER

03:21:16.731 --> 03:21:17.899
PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THEM BUT

03:21:17.965 --> 03:21:19.867
YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS

03:21:19.934 --> 03:21:21.969
WAS DIALYSIS ON THE PRO SIDE

03:21:22.036 --> 03:21:23.938
DIALYSIS PROVIDERS A STEERING

03:21:24.005 --> 03:21:25.840
PEOPLE AWAY FROM MEDICARE AND

03:21:25.907 --> 03:21:28.676
ALL TO PRIVATE PLANS. TO

03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:30.411
BASICALLY BENEFIT PROCESS.

03:21:30.478 --> 03:21:32.113
ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE --

03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:32.680
THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT

03:21:32.747 --> 03:21:34.248
STEERING WHEEL WORKING WITH

03:21:34.315 --> 03:21:36.384
PATIENTS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST

03:21:36.451 --> 03:21:36.918
PATH FOR THE PATIENT GOING

03:21:36.984 --> 03:21:38.419
FORWARD.

03:21:38.486 --> 03:21:40.488
ON THE PRO SIDE YOU KNOW ONCE A

03:21:40.555 --> 03:21:42.757
PATIENT RUNS OUT OF THEIR THIRTY

03:21:42.824 --> 03:21:44.525
MONTHS OF PRIVATE INSURANCE.

03:21:44.592 --> 03:21:46.561
THE CLINIC WILL KICK THEM OUT ON

03:21:46.627 --> 03:21:48.262
THE STREET WITH NO TREATMENT.

03:21:48.329 --> 03:21:49.964
THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO BECAUSE

03:21:50.031 --> 03:21:51.065
THEY GET ON TO MEDICARE WITH

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:53.301
THEM THAT'S A PROMISE SO WE'RE

03:21:53.367 --> 03:21:54.435
YOU KNOW.

03:21:54.502 --> 03:21:56.370
I'M THINKING OKAY WELL THEY

03:21:56.437 --> 03:21:58.139
WOULD BE ON MEDICARE --

03:21:58.206 --> 03:22:01.042
AT SOME POINT --

03:22:01.108 --> 03:22:04.612
THE PRO SIDE SAYS THAT OF THE

03:22:04.679 --> 03:22:06.481
AMERICAN KIDNEY FUNDS IS ABUSING

03:22:06.547 --> 03:22:08.015
ITS AUTHORITY.

03:22:08.082 --> 03:22:09.584
SHOULD ONLY BE PAYING COPAYS NOW

03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:10.685
PREMIUMS.

03:22:10.751 --> 03:22:11.986
AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND HAS THE

03:22:12.053 --> 03:22:14.222
AUTHORITY ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE

03:22:14.288 --> 03:22:16.023
TO PAY PREMIUMS UNDER FEDERAL

03:22:16.090 --> 03:22:17.492
REGULATIONS.

03:22:17.558 --> 03:22:18.626
AND I'M LISTENING TO TESTIMONY

03:22:18.693 --> 03:22:20.461
TODAY.

03:22:20.528 --> 03:22:23.431
AND SAYING THAT --

03:22:23.498 --> 03:22:24.799
YOU KNOW MEDICAL LOSS RATIO

03:22:24.866 --> 03:22:26.167
WOULD BE LOWER.

03:22:26.234 --> 03:22:28.402
POSSIBLY YOU KNOW 1% INCREASE IN

03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:30.271
PREMIUMS.

03:22:30.338 --> 03:22:32.907
UP THERE'S NOT A COMMITMENT THAT

03:22:32.974 --> 03:22:34.075
PATIENT PREMIUMS WOULD BE

03:22:34.141 --> 03:22:38.079
LOWERED WHICH IS A CONCERN --

03:22:38.145 --> 03:22:39.313
ANY SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY PAYING

03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:40.915
MEDICARE RATES IS BUILT INTO

03:22:40.982 --> 03:22:43.150
FUTURE PREMIUM MODELS ON THE PRO

03:22:43.217 --> 03:22:44.118
SIDE.

03:22:44.185 --> 03:22:45.987
HEALTH PLANS WILL CO A WINDFALL

03:22:46.053 --> 03:22:46.988
OF SAVINGS.

03:22:47.054 --> 03:22:48.523
NOT REDUCING THE COST OF

03:22:48.589 --> 03:22:52.226
TREATMENT.

03:22:52.293 --> 03:22:52.860
ONE FOUR THOUSAND ENROLLEES ARE

03:22:52.927 --> 03:22:54.695
OFF SO IT'S LIKE.

03:22:54.762 --> 03:22:57.198
BACK AND FORTH BUT LIKE TENNIS I

03:22:57.265 --> 03:22:59.367
MEAN LITERALLY YOU CAN SEE BOTH

03:22:59.433 --> 03:23:00.701
SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT.

03:23:00.768 --> 03:23:02.570
AND THE CONCERN OBVIOUSLY FROM

03:23:02.637 --> 03:23:05.239
ALL OF US IS FOR THE PATIENT AND

03:23:05.306 --> 03:23:06.474
FOR THEIR ACCESS.

03:23:06.541 --> 03:23:08.776
SO THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT IT --

03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:09.744
AND ONE OF THE POINTS YOU KNOW

03:23:09.810 --> 03:23:12.513
I'VE RUN A BUSINESS I UNDERSTAND.

03:23:12.580 --> 03:23:15.182
PROFIT AND ISSUES WITH THAT.

03:23:15.249 --> 03:23:16.417
LOTS OF TIMES WE RUN A BUSINESS

03:23:16.484 --> 03:23:17.852
GET A PROFIT BUT THAT DOESN'T

03:23:17.919 --> 03:23:19.086
MEAN THAT THE OWNERS OF

03:23:19.153 --> 03:23:20.288
POCKETING IT.

03:23:20.354 --> 03:23:22.023
BECAUSE IT REALLY GOES INTO THE

03:23:22.089 --> 03:23:24.292
COST OF RUNNING THE BUSINESS

03:23:24.358 --> 03:23:26.327
EXPANDING THE BUSINESS --

03:23:26.394 --> 03:23:29.230
YOU KNOW.

03:23:29.297 --> 03:23:32.800
IT CAME UP IN THE HEARING THAT --

03:23:32.867 --> 03:23:35.202
FOR THE 10% THAT WOULD BE

03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:36.671
AFFECTED.

03:23:36.737 --> 03:23:39.807
THE LOSE AROUND TWENTY FIVE TO

03:23:39.874 --> 03:23:40.908
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT.

03:23:40.975 --> 03:23:43.144
OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS

03:23:43.210 --> 03:23:45.079
REPORTED.

03:23:45.146 --> 03:23:46.347
BUT SINCE MEDICARE'S ONLY

03:23:46.414 --> 03:23:48.749
COVERING 6280% OF THE COST OF

03:23:48.816 --> 03:23:50.985
THE TREATMENT.

03:23:51.052 --> 03:23:54.589
THAT LEAVES 2240% OF TREATMENT

03:23:54.655 --> 03:23:55.890
490% OF THE PATIENTS NOT BEING

03:23:55.957 --> 03:23:58.659
COVERED.

03:23:58.726 --> 03:24:00.494
IF I'M UNDERSTANDING IT RIGHT.

03:24:00.561 --> 03:24:02.496
SO WHAT IS THE COST OF THAT

03:24:02.563 --> 03:24:03.764
DIFFERENCE.

03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:05.766
AND THE MONEY MUST COME OUT OF

03:24:05.833 --> 03:24:08.436
THE PROFITS.

03:24:08.502 --> 03:24:09.036
WHERE ELSE WOULD IT BE COMING

03:24:09.103 --> 03:24:09.236
FROM?

03:24:09.303 --> 03:24:10.705
SO I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THIS

03:24:10.771 --> 03:24:12.340
WALL LOOKED AT IT.

03:24:12.406 --> 03:24:13.774
THE SITUATION BASICALLY IS AN

03:24:13.841 --> 03:24:17.111
INDIVIDUAL ON EMPLOYER INSURANCE.

03:24:17.178 --> 03:24:18.913
THEY END UP YOU KNOW OVER TIME

03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:21.349
GETTING END STAGE RENAL DISEASE

03:24:21.415 --> 03:24:22.783
THEY LOSE THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF

03:24:22.850 --> 03:24:24.452
THE TIME COMMITMENT IT TAKES. TO

03:24:24.518 --> 03:24:25.853
TREAT.

03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:28.022
THE DISEASE GOING INTO DIALYSIS

03:24:28.089 --> 03:24:29.657
THREE TIMES A WEEK OR MORE.

03:24:29.724 --> 03:24:30.458
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR

03:24:30.524 --> 03:24:32.126
INSURANCE THEY WANT TO KEEP THE

03:24:32.193 --> 03:24:33.294
CONTINUITY.

03:24:33.361 --> 03:24:35.329
THE KIDNEY FUND PAYS PREMIUMS

03:24:35.396 --> 03:24:37.531
FOR UP TO THIRTY MONTHS.

03:24:37.598 --> 03:24:39.000
AT THE END OF THIRTY MONTHS THEY

03:24:39.066 --> 03:24:40.935
CAN AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:42.370
MEDICARE.

03:24:42.436 --> 03:24:44.739
MEDICARE PAYS 6280% OF THE COST

03:24:44.805 --> 03:24:47.742
OF DIALYSIS TREATMENT FOR THE

03:24:47.808 --> 03:24:47.942
90%.

03:24:48.009 --> 03:24:49.910
OF PATIENTS.

03:24:49.977 --> 03:24:51.078
PRIVATE INSURANCE IS ABOUT

03:24:51.145 --> 03:24:55.116
FAVORITE TAKE TIM --

03:24:55.182 --> 03:24:56.884
PAYS A HIGHER COST WHICH

03:24:56.951 --> 03:24:58.552
BASICALLY SUBSIDIZES.

03:24:58.619 --> 03:25:00.755
THE OTHER PATIENTS.

03:25:00.821 --> 03:25:02.623
WHO ARE GETTING THE TILES SO

03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:05.092
THAT'S THE MODEL AT LEAST THE

03:25:05.159 --> 03:25:06.894
WAY THAT I'M SEEING IT SO?

03:25:06.961 --> 03:25:08.362
IF THE PATIENT IS WEALTHY AND

03:25:08.429 --> 03:25:10.164
COMPARE THEIR OWN PREMIUMS THEY

03:25:10.231 --> 03:25:11.866
DON'T NEED PREMIUM ASSISTANCE

03:25:11.932 --> 03:25:13.267
THIS BILL DOESN'T AFFECT THEM.

03:25:13.334 --> 03:25:14.869
SO WE'RE ONLY REALLY TALKING

03:25:14.935 --> 03:25:16.937
ABOUT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE LOW

03:25:17.004 --> 03:25:19.240
INCOME.

03:25:19.306 --> 03:25:20.207
WHICH IS KIND OF AN UNINTENDED

03:25:20.274 --> 03:25:23.411
CONSEQUENCE --

03:25:23.477 --> 03:25:25.446
I HAVE THREE DIALYSIS CLINICS IN

03:25:25.513 --> 03:25:26.914
MY DISTRICT.

03:25:26.981 --> 03:25:28.916
IF THIS BILL PASSES YOU KNOW THE

03:25:28.983 --> 03:25:31.285
CONCERN IS ABOUT THEM POSSIBLY

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:33.387
CLOSING EVEN IF ONE OF THE THREE

03:25:33.454 --> 03:25:34.689
CLOSE.

03:25:34.755 --> 03:25:36.090
YEAH THEY'RE SPREAD ALL OVER OF

03:25:36.157 --> 03:25:38.059
A LARGE DISTRICT AS YOU KNOW YOU

03:25:38.125 --> 03:25:39.593
DO AND OTHERS --

03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:40.594
THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO

03:25:40.661 --> 03:25:43.264
TRAVEL OVER FIFTY MILES TO GET

03:25:43.330 --> 03:25:44.532
TO A DIALYSIS CLINIC.

03:25:44.598 --> 03:25:48.836
THAT'S A CONCERN --

03:25:48.903 --> 03:25:50.705
ACCESS TO THE HOSPITAL'S KNOW

03:25:50.771 --> 03:25:51.906
THAT THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE'S

03:25:51.972 --> 03:25:53.641
GOING TO GO BECAUSE OF WHERE

03:25:53.708 --> 03:25:56.010
ELSE SOMETHING AND GO --

03:25:56.077 --> 03:25:57.978
SO AT THIS POINT I DON'T FEEL

03:25:58.045 --> 03:25:59.980
COMFORTABLE WITH CONTROLLING THE

03:26:00.047 --> 03:26:01.615
COSTS OF BASICALLY RATE SETTING

03:26:01.682 --> 03:26:03.184
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE BRING UP

03:26:03.250 --> 03:26:04.819
THESE RATE SETTING NO MATTER IF

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:07.755
IT'S PHARMACEUTICALS OR OTHER

03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:08.723
THINGS.

03:26:08.789 --> 03:26:10.458
WHICH COULD PUT LIVES AND HEALTH

03:26:10.524 --> 03:26:11.826
OF PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY BY

03:26:11.892 --> 03:26:13.894
REDUCING ACCESS SO I'M GOING TO

03:26:13.961 --> 03:26:15.229
BE LAYING OFF THE BILL.

03:26:15.296 --> 03:26:17.164
TODAY BECAUSE THIS DISCUSSION IS

03:26:17.231 --> 03:26:19.066
VERY DEEP.

03:26:19.133 --> 03:26:21.335
AND I JUST WANNA SEE WORK GOALS

03:26:21.402 --> 03:26:24.872
FOR US FOR OUR PATIENTS.

03:26:24.939 --> 03:26:27.875
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

03:26:27.942 --> 03:26:28.976
I JUST --

03:26:29.043 --> 03:26:31.445
MAYBE QUICK COMMENT AND THEN --

03:26:31.512 --> 03:26:32.680
I DON'T KNOW YOUR QUESTION WILL

03:26:32.747 --> 03:26:33.647
POP UP --

03:26:33.714 --> 03:26:35.349
POP UP AS I'M THINKING HERE --

03:26:35.416 --> 03:26:36.450
LAST YEAR --

03:26:36.517 --> 03:26:38.219
WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP THEN IT

03:26:38.285 --> 03:26:39.887
WAS SENATOR LEYVA AS A BILL?

03:26:39.954 --> 03:26:43.290
AND I HAD I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

03:26:43.357 --> 03:26:45.426
THIS LAST YEAR AND AND STARTING

03:26:45.493 --> 03:26:46.894
OFF WITH THIS I WAS --

03:26:46.961 --> 03:26:49.897
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL

03:26:49.964 --> 03:26:51.365
THAT AND MOVE FORWARD AND I GOT

03:26:51.432 --> 03:26:52.633
TO MAYBE MY SEVENTH OR EIGHTH

03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:53.934
MEETING --

03:26:54.001 --> 03:26:55.402
ON THIS ISSUE.

03:26:55.469 --> 03:26:56.871
AND THE CRUX FOR ME WHERE I

03:26:56.937 --> 03:26:58.472
BEGAN TO TURN --

03:26:58.539 --> 03:26:59.607
WAS WHEN SOMEONE WAS SITTING IN

03:26:59.673 --> 03:27:01.776
MY OFFICE AND THEY SAID THAT

03:27:01.842 --> 03:27:03.077
THEY WOULD NOT THE AMERICAN

03:27:03.144 --> 03:27:05.179
KIDNEY FUND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

03:27:05.246 --> 03:27:06.714
CONTINUE THEIR PREMIUM

03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:07.915
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

03:27:07.982 --> 03:27:09.049
IF THEY WERE NOT GETTING

03:27:09.116 --> 03:27:12.119
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TWO MAJOR --

03:27:12.186 --> 03:27:14.722
BUT ASK DASS SOME COMPANIES.

03:27:14.789 --> 03:27:16.123
AND IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I

03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:18.125
THOUGHT.

03:27:18.192 --> 03:27:20.227
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT

03:27:20.294 --> 03:27:21.796
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.

03:27:21.862 --> 03:27:24.498
IF THERE IS --

03:27:24.565 --> 03:27:26.066
SIXTY THOUSAND CONTRIBUTORS TO

03:27:26.133 --> 03:27:27.535
THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WHY.

03:27:27.601 --> 03:27:28.969
CAN'T THEY PROVIDE THIS PREMIUM

03:27:29.036 --> 03:27:30.704
ASSISTANCE WITH THOSE SIXTY

03:27:30.771 --> 03:27:32.139
THOUSAND MEMBERS THAT THEY HAVE

03:27:32.206 --> 03:27:33.440
WHY DO THEY NEED.

03:27:33.507 --> 03:27:34.909
THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM JUST A

03:27:34.975 --> 03:27:36.610
COUPLE OF OF DIFFERENT DIALYSIS

03:27:36.677 --> 03:27:37.778
CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

03:27:37.845 --> 03:27:39.814
PROGRAM WORK AND THAT'S WHEN I

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:40.481
WENT -- I

03:27:40.548 --> 03:27:43.851
NEED TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT MORE.

03:27:43.918 --> 03:27:45.085
THAT WE HEARD TODAY --

03:27:45.152 --> 03:27:48.489
FROM PHùIT'S ARE BAD I

03:27:48.556 --> 03:27:50.224
ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

03:27:50.291 --> 03:27:51.292
PROFITS ARE BAD --

03:27:51.358 --> 03:27:54.195
WE LIVE NOT IN A PROFIT SYSTEM --

03:27:54.261 --> 03:27:55.529
CAPITALISM IS NOT A PROFIT

03:27:55.596 --> 03:27:57.898
SYSTEM DOES A PROFIT AND LOSS

03:27:57.965 --> 03:27:59.033
SYSTEM AND WHEN YOU HAVE.

03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:00.734
A FEW UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS

03:28:00.801 --> 03:28:02.102
PROFITS MEAN THAT YOU'RE

03:28:02.169 --> 03:28:03.671
PROVIDING VALUE --

03:28:03.737 --> 03:28:05.306
TO TO FOLKS IF YOU HAVE A LOSS

03:28:05.372 --> 03:28:06.073
THAT MEANS THAT YOU GOT TO RUN

03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:06.974
YOUR COMPANY A LITTLE BIT BETTER

03:28:07.041 --> 03:28:08.676
TO TRY TO GET TO BE ABLE TO GET

03:28:08.742 --> 03:28:09.977
TO A PROFIT.

03:28:10.044 --> 03:28:10.845
WHICH ARE TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH

03:28:10.911 --> 03:28:12.713
CARE HEALTHCARE IS NOT A PURE

03:28:12.780 --> 03:28:14.448
PROFIT LOSS SYSTEM YOU DON'T

03:28:14.515 --> 03:28:15.282
HAVE -- A A

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:17.484
A PURE MARKET THERE ARE FOLKS

03:28:17.551 --> 03:28:19.153
THAT ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM WE

03:28:19.220 --> 03:28:20.154
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

03:28:20.221 --> 03:28:22.623
A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LAST

03:28:22.690 --> 03:28:23.090
YEAR.

03:28:23.157 --> 03:28:24.358
I AM ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE I

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:27.161
WAS MADE AWARE TODAY THAT I HAVE --

03:28:27.228 --> 03:28:28.929
SIXTY INDIVIDUALS IN MY DISTRICT --

03:28:28.996 --> 03:28:29.363
THAT ARE --

03:28:29.430 --> 03:28:31.565
ON THIS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PLAN

03:28:31.632 --> 03:28:34.001
AND I I'M SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS

03:28:34.068 --> 03:28:35.202
WANT TO CONTINUE --

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:37.638
ON ON THAT PLAN WE HAVE A MAN A

03:28:37.705 --> 03:28:40.207
MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM WITHIN OUR

03:28:40.274 --> 03:28:41.709
SYSTEM OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:28:41.775 --> 03:28:45.212
THAT DOUBLE WE KNOW.

03:28:45.279 --> 03:28:46.814
THAT UP AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR

03:28:46.881 --> 03:28:48.349
GDP IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

03:28:48.415 --> 03:28:50.017
HERE IN CALIFORNIA --

03:28:50.084 --> 03:28:52.319
WE SPEND MORE PER GDP PER CAPITA

03:28:52.386 --> 03:28:53.787
THAN VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE ELSE

03:28:53.854 --> 03:28:55.389
WHY IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T

03:28:55.456 --> 03:28:57.758
HAVE A A PURE --

03:28:57.825 --> 03:28:59.960
BUT COMPETITIVE OF HEALTH CARE A

03:29:00.027 --> 03:29:02.062
MARKET SO WE'VE GOT FOLKS THAT

03:29:02.129 --> 03:29:03.564
ARE COMING TO US IN THEIRS THE

03:29:03.631 --> 03:29:05.032
TERM OF RENT SEEKING FOLKS ARE

03:29:05.099 --> 03:29:06.767
COMING TO US ASKING US TO BE

03:29:06.834 --> 03:29:09.069
ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS.

03:29:09.136 --> 03:29:10.504
AND IT IS IT OESN'T IT JUST AT

03:29:10.571 --> 03:29:12.706
ITS CORE IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT

03:29:12.773 --> 03:29:14.141
THAT FOR A COMPANY TO SAY FOR

03:29:14.208 --> 03:29:14.942
THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE

03:29:15.009 --> 03:29:16.777
PROFITABLE THERE HAS TO BE A

03:29:16.844 --> 03:29:17.978
SCHEME IN WHICH IS A NONPROFIT

03:29:18.045 --> 03:29:19.446
ORGANIZATION ON THE SIDE THAT

03:29:19.513 --> 03:29:21.949
THEY HAVE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS.

03:29:22.016 --> 03:29:22.850
TO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR

03:29:22.917 --> 03:29:25.019
SYSTEM WORK THAT'S NOT DEFEAT AS

03:29:25.085 --> 03:29:26.320
FAULT THAT'S NOT FOR SINISE'S

03:29:26.387 --> 03:29:27.688
FAULT THAT'S THE FACT THAT OUR

03:29:27.755 --> 03:29:29.690
SYSTEM ISN'T BUILT PROPERLY TO

03:29:29.757 --> 03:29:31.358
MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE.

03:29:31.425 --> 03:29:32.259
TO OPERATE AND THEN WITH THE

03:29:32.326 --> 03:29:33.827
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN THEY

03:29:33.894 --> 03:29:35.262
CAME IN WITH MAKING SURE THAT

03:29:35.329 --> 03:29:36.897
THERE'S GUARANTEED ISSUE THAT

03:29:36.964 --> 03:29:38.399
THROUGH ANOTHER WRENCH IN INTO

03:29:38.465 --> 03:29:39.466
THE SYSTEM.

03:29:39.533 --> 03:29:41.035
AND SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT

03:29:41.101 --> 03:29:43.137
UPON US AS LEGISLATORS TO

03:29:43.203 --> 03:29:44.939
CONTINUE TO KEEP DOING THIS WORK

03:29:45.005 --> 03:29:45.673
THIS ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE

03:29:45.739 --> 03:29:46.974
PROBLEM.

03:29:47.041 --> 03:29:47.808
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

03:29:47.875 --> 03:29:50.144
LOOK AT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:51.845
COMPREHENSIVELY AND WHEN WE SEE

03:29:51.912 --> 03:29:53.414
THESE INEFFICIENCIES BECAUSE

03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:54.949
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS IT IS

03:29:55.015 --> 03:29:56.150
INEFFICIENT.

03:29:56.216 --> 03:29:57.418
IT'S NOT WRONG IT'S NOT

03:29:57.484 --> 03:30:00.354
NEFARIOUS IT'S NOT EVIL IT'S NOT

03:30:00.421 --> 03:30:02.122
OF ALL ABOUT PROFIT MONGERING

03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:03.724
BUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS APT IS

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:05.859
INEFFICIENCY THE WE'VE GOT TO

03:30:05.926 --> 03:30:07.828
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE.

03:30:07.895 --> 03:30:09.496
AND SO FOR TODAY I KNOW THIS

03:30:09.563 --> 03:30:10.664
ISN'T THIS ISN'T IT THIS IS IN

03:30:10.731 --> 03:30:12.099
THE THE SOLUTION FOR ALL BUT IT

03:30:12.166 --> 03:30:13.400
IS A PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT

03:30:13.467 --> 03:30:14.601
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP.

03:30:14.668 --> 03:30:17.004
TALKING ABOUT I GUESS I DON'T

03:30:17.071 --> 03:30:18.305
HAVE A QUESTION THERE --

03:30:18.372 --> 03:30:22.409
Là MISTER CHAIR --

03:30:22.476 --> 03:30:23.844
IN THE IN SO WITH THAT I WOULD

03:30:23.911 --> 03:30:27.214
AND FOR THE THE ROBUST

03:30:27.281 --> 03:30:29.616
DISCUSSION LOOK THIS BILL IS NOT

03:30:29.683 --> 03:30:31.251
INCONSISTENT WITH ALL THE WORK

03:30:31.318 --> 03:30:31.852
I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST

03:30:31.919 --> 03:30:32.753
SEVERAL YEARS.

03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:34.588
BUT YEAR WE DO WE WORK ON A BILL

03:30:34.655 --> 03:30:35.956
RELATED TO DRUG COUPONS.

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.191
WHAT ARE THAT BILL DO

03:30:37.257 --> 03:30:38.359
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR

03:30:38.425 --> 03:30:39.860
USING COUPONS AS A WAY TO KEEP

03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:41.462
PEOPLE ON THEIR HIGHER PRICED

03:30:41.528 --> 03:30:43.330
MEDICATIONS FOR LONGER WHEN

03:30:43.397 --> 03:30:44.798
THERE WAS A GENERIC AVAILABLE?

03:30:44.865 --> 03:30:46.300
INTERESTING WE WE ASK THE

03:30:46.367 --> 03:30:48.002
COUPONS TO GO AWAY WHAT HAVE WE

03:30:48.068 --> 03:30:50.537
ASK FOR THAT TO NOT HAPPEN --

03:30:50.604 --> 03:30:51.939
THE COUPONS DISAPPEARED EVEN

03:30:52.006 --> 03:30:53.007
FROM IN THOSE CASES WHERE THEY

03:30:53.073 --> 03:30:54.508
COULD BE LEGITIMATELY USED IN

03:30:54.575 --> 03:30:55.509
MANY CASES.

03:30:55.576 --> 03:30:57.044
WE LOOK AT PHARMACY BENEFIT

03:30:57.111 --> 03:30:58.579
MANAGERS AND TRANSPARENCY AROUND

03:30:58.645 --> 03:30:59.713
A MIDDLE MAN.

03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:01.915
THAT GENERATES TWO HUNDRED AND

03:31:01.982 --> 03:31:03.150
SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

03:31:03.217 --> 03:31:04.485
PROFIT --

03:31:04.551 --> 03:31:06.453
WITH THREE COME THIS SENSUALLY

AS A MIDDLE MAN.

03:31:11.425 --> 03:31:12.626
WE HEARD SOME REALLY INTERESTING

03:31:12.693 --> 03:31:14.561
STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY GENERATE

03:31:14.628 --> 03:31:16.030

03:31:18.232 --> 03:31:20.334
TRANSPARENCY BILL PASSED WE HAD

03:31:20.401 --> 03:31:21.702

03:31:25.039 --> 03:31:26.907
AND THAT BILL AFTER MUCH DEBATE

03:31:26.974 --> 03:31:28.675
MUCH DISCUSSION OVER TWO YEARS

03:31:28.742 --> 03:31:30.577

03:31:35.649 --> 03:31:36.817
YEAR THAT LOOKED AT HEALTH PLAN

03:31:36.884 --> 03:31:38.085
MERGERS AND OVERSIGHT OVER

03:31:38.152 --> 03:31:39.720
HEALTH PLAN MERGERS BECAUSE I

03:31:39.787 --> 03:31:42.756
