COMMITTEE FOR MONDAY AUGUST TWENTY SIX WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL HEARING WE ARE IN RESOLUTION HAVEN'T YES AND WE HAVE SEVERAL I WILL NOTE THAT IT OF NUMBER FOUR EIGHT EIGHT OR HR FORTY FOUR IS. THAT WILL TAKE THAT UP WE HAVE A QUORUM START WITH OUR ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHT. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TAKE YOUR STAFF FOR THE WONDERFUL ANALYSIS AS WELL AJ ARE TWENTY ONE WOULD DECLARE CALIFORNIA SUPPORT FOR HR FORTY THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO STUDY AND DEVELOP PROPOSALS FOR REPARATIONS TO DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THIS SIMPLY PUTS A RECORD TO SUPPORT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD STUDY. THE ISSUE OF REPARATIONS. FURTHERMORE THIS RESOLUTION FORMALLY APOLOGIZES FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S COMPLICITY AND FURTHERING THE PRACTICE OF ALL FLAVOR IN CALIFORNIA. EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS MONTH THE FIRST SHIP CARRYING TWENTY ENSLAVED AFRICANS ARRIVED IN THE COLONY OF VIRGINIA. THESE TWENTY PEOPLE WERE THE FIRST OF AN ESTIMATED FOUR MILLION AFRICANS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS THAT WOULD BECOME ENSLAVED IN THE COLONIES AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE COUNTLESS NATIVE AMERICANS THEY WERE VIRTUALLY IN SLAVE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE CONSIDER THE MAGNITUDE OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE IMPORTANCE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ONLY A PRIVATE ACT. THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY. WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY AND STATUTORILY SANCTIONED BY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE THE ADMISSION AS A SO CALLED FREE STATE WE PERMITTED THE VIRTUAL TRAFFICKING AND ENSLAVEMENT OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND EARLY YEARS OF STATEHOOD. CALIFORNIA WAS ALSO VERY ACCOMMODATING AND COMPLICIT IN FURTHERING THE PRACTICE OF SLAVERY IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BY PASSING ITS OWN VERSION OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT. AND THIS PRACTICE REMAINED UNIMPEDED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY UNTIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION WAS. ABOLISHED SLAVERY. DESPITE THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAME THE SUBJECT OF TARGETED DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES THAT SOUGHT TO MAINTAIN BASICALLY THE STATUS QUO. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ENACTED POLICIES AND PRACTICES FROM SHARECROPPING CONVICT LEASING REDLINING RESTRICTIVE HOUSING COVENANTS AN EQUAL EDUCATION PUNITIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MEASURE AND OTHERS WHICH SPECIFICALLY TARGETED ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN AFRICAN AMERICANS. BECAUSE OF THIS TARGETED DISCRIMINATION AND EFFECTS STEMMING FROM THE PRACTICE. OF SLAVERY AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE TO FACE DEBILITATING SOMETIMES ECONOMIC EDUCATION AND HEALTH HARDSHIPS FROM WHICH RECOVERY HAS BEEN DAUNTING AND OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE AS WE CONTINUE TO PUT. OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF TRUE EQUALITY. WHAT SLAVERY WAS FORMALLY ABOLISHED OVER HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO ITS LEGACY ON THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS ARE CLEAR JUST AS GOVERNMENT HAD A ROLE IN ENABLING THE ENSLAVEMENT DISCRIMINATION OF AN ENTIRE POPULATION IT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPLORE AVENUES OF REDRESS FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE THE HISTORICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS INSTITUTION. THE. ASIAN ARE FOR ME THE COMMISSION BE REPARATION PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS ACTED DOES EXACTLY THAT HR FORTY WOULD ESTABLISH A FEDERAL COMMISSION TO STUDY THE LEGACIES OF SLAVERY IN OUR COUNTRY AND TO DEVELOP PROPOSALS FOR REPARATIONS TO DESCENDANTS OF ENSLAVED PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES OUR COUNTRY CAN'T BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE INCREDIBLE RACIAL INEQUITIES STILL PREVALENT IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY UNTIL WEEKS AFTER WORK TOWARDS REDRESS OF OUR COUNTRY'S ORIGINAL SIN I THINK THE TIMING IS PERFECT IN ADDRESSING THIS AND THE- RESOLUTION AND TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT UNTIL WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. AND OUR CHILDREN AND OUR OUR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE DID IN THIS COUNTRY AND INTEL WE REALLY COME TO TERMS WITH THAT AND ADDRESS IT THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE TYPE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE TYPE OF COUNTRY THAT WE OFTEN SUGGEST WE DO SET WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY FROM ABOUT THANK YOU ARE THEIR. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WAS CAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NOW I THINK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF OF THE REALLY EXCELLENT STAFF FOR THE GOES IN A LOT OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND IN PARTICULAR. YOU KNOW BUT IT'S ALL IT'S REFERRED TO OFTENTIMES OF THE OF THE TERM FORTY ACRES AND A MULE AND REFERRING TO THAT AND STAFF OR GENERAL SHERMAN SPECIAL ORDER. ORDER FIFTEEN. WHICH WAS A VERY I MEAN IN THEM AND THAT IN THAT MOMENT IN TIME WHEN YOU HAD THE- POWER TO DO SO ON THE GROUND. AS THESE PLANTATION BE ABANDONED. TO HAVE THE WISDOM IS INVOLVED WHO BETTER TO GIVE THE LAND TO. THEM TO THOSE FORMERLY ENSLAVED AND WAS GIVING THESE ORDERS OUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA. AND THEN OF COURSE PRESIDENT JOHNSON GETS IN THERE AND NOT ONLY REMOVES THAT ORDER BUT IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS ALL. RIGHT. SALAS BUT JIM AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT. OF CODIFICATION AND LAW OF FOR THE SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP OF AFRICAN AMERICANS EVEN TO THE MODERN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK THAT ALL OF US CERTAINLY THAT SUPPORT THIS BELIEVE JUST AS YOU DO I'M SURE THAT. WAS A LONG TIME COMING AND A LOT OF THE- THE RACIAL ANIMUS AND ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH RACE. PARTLY IS ABOUT IS IN PART BECAUSE WE NEVER DEALT WITH THE RACE ISSUE AND IN PARTICULAR DEALT WITH. THE REPERCUSSIONS OF AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR. WHAT WE DID TO THE ENSLAVED AFTER EVERYBODY HERE AND HOPE TO ONLY TO MODERN DAY AFTER AMERICANS WERE STILL. GET THEIR PRODUCT IN A MEAL. SO I THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS. THANK YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE AND TAKE. ON. HOW YOU GONZALEZ PRESENT HOLDEN KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE NORRIS REYES. THANK YOU WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. PART MY VOICE TOO MUCH TIME ON THE PHONE. YEAH THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS WHERE 95% OF WHAT YOU SAID I COULDN'T COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH AND I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT LAST 5% BECAUSE THAT. NO REALLY OP TYPE WHEN I SAY YES I IT MEANS I'M I'M AGREEING TO EVERYTHING AND I WANT TO BRING UP SPECIFICALLY THE TOPIC OF REPARATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE FOR WHAT FOR ME IS THE GRAY AREA. AND IN THE RESOLUTION TO TALK ABOUT THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT IN THE REPARATIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE JAPANESE INTERNEES DURING WORLD WAR TWO. WHICH I THINK WAS VERY APPROPRIATE BUT- THAT IS JUST A BIG TURN FOR REPARATIONS TO THE- TERMS OF SLAVERY BUT I MEAN THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES BECAUSE- WHEN. THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT WAS PASSED. THERE WERE MANY OF THE JAPANESE INTERNEES THAT WERE STILL ALIVE AND SO WAS A DIRECT COMPENSATION PAID TO THAT WHERE. ARE RIGHT NOW THE LAST. AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVE I BELIEVE DIED NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SPOKE. A TO ME THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY YOU THINK. THAT EXAMPLE PLIES WHY REPARATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. SO THAT I WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT. AS A BODY IT MAY HAVE PERSONAL VIEWS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT FORTY ACRES AND A MULE WE ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING THE MATH ON IT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS RIGHT THIS BILL SUPPORTS THE COMMISSION THAT WILL STUDY WHETHER THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS. WE PLACED IN THE EXAMPLE OF JAPANESE INTERNMENT BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST MODERN DAY EXAMPLE WE HAVE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT THE FURTHER WE GET AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION HAVING NOT ADDRESSED SLAVERY OF COURSE EVERYBODY DIES. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED DIED AND I THINK ABOUT IN IN MY OWN FAMILY. MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A DESCENDANT OF AFRICAN SLAVES. AFRICAN ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND IN HIGH SCHOOL HAVING TO HAVE TO DO A PROJECT IN AN ON ONE SIDE BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW A WORD IMMIGRANT FAMILY BUT BEING ABLE TO TRACE EXACTLY IN MEXICO WHERE WERE FROM RIGHT I MEAN. YOU KNOW. AND WE END UP HAVING TO SUBMIT. TERRIBLY ARE PRIVATE INFORMATION TO A DNA TEST TO TRY TO FIND THE INFORMATION BECAUSE NOBODY IN HER FAMILY ON THE OTHER SIDE COULD TRACE THAT AND I KNOW THAT COULD HAPPEN IN A NON OUT THE AFRICAN FAMILY. BUT IT TO EVEN TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE ON A CONTINENT YOUR ANCESTORS WERE FROM BECAUSE YOUR HISTORY WAS COMPLETELY ERASED BY AN INSTITUTION. IT'S PRETTY POWERFUL AND SO I'M A LITTLE BIASED IN IN THE AFFECTS OF THAT NOW. I THINK I LIKE THIS BILL AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS NOTHING NEW BECAUSE IT CALLS FOR COMMISSION TO STUDY THIS I MEAN I MADE AN ANY JERK REACTION BELIEVE YOU NOW YOUR PROMISE FORTY ACRES AND A MULE YOU WOULD OF THEN BUILT WEALTH AND PASS THAT ON TO GENERATIONS. THAT IS IN EFFECT AS WELL THERE IS NO BILL TWELFTH IN SO MANY OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING TO START WITH THEM WHAT WAS PROMISED WAS TAKEN AWAY. AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF A FAX I THINK THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES IT SIMPLY STATES WE CAN SUPPORT THE IDEA FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STUDY NESS AND COMING. UP REFEREES. RIGHT NOT. YES I'M AT BUT REPARATIONS COULD BE ADMISSIONS RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT MAY SOUND SILLY WE CAN SAY THERE'S HISTORY BOOKS BUT IT SHOULD MISSION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY. FAMILIES WERE TALK ABOUT SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AT THE BORDER RIGHT NOW AND IT REMINDS ME THIS IS NOTHING NEW IN AND US HISTORY AND AS AS CONCERNED AS I AM WITH THOSE KIDS WHAT HAPPENED IN SLAVE PLANTATIONS IS JUST SHOCKING AND THE EFFECTS WE KNOW NOW BECAUSE OF MODERN. YOU KNOW MEDICINE BASICALLY THAT THE EFFECTS ON THAT CHILD WILL WILL AFFECT THAT CHILD AND POSSIBLY THEIR CHILDREN. THAT THAT HAPPENED AND THOSE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN YOU KNOW TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE RIPPED FROM THEIR THEIR MOMS MOMS WHO BY THE WAY WERE RAPED IN ORDER TO BEAR THAT CHILD. AND SO I JUST THINK IT'S TIME IF WE WANT TO GET PASSED SO MUCH OF THE DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY AND SUMMIT A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. OF WHY I'M ARE THE WAY THEY ARE WE TO BE HONEST BUT THE PACKED AND I THINK WE START HERE. SURE. AGAIN WE ARE NINE FIVE SENATORS EVERY JUST AND I THINK THE CRUX OF THE THEN IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT REPARATIONS MAIN BECAUSE IF WE TALK ABOUT THOSE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES YOU MENTION I COMPLETELY AGREE IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO ADDRESS A PERSISTENT. ACHIEVEMENT GAP WEALTH GAP IN EDUCATION GAP THAT WE THAT STILL PERSIST IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY I THINK HAS ITS ROOTS IN SLAVERY I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE SOCIETY ADDRESS THAT WE ARE DOING SOME THINGS WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE. THE OF WHAT WE DISAGREE ON IS THAT ARE WHEN I READ H. R. R. FORTY THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT REPARATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE IT'S DECIDING. ARE ON A METHODOLOGY FOR APPROPRIATING MONEY AND DISTRIBUTING IT YOU KNOW IT'S GONE WAY BEYOND THAT IF THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AN HR FORTY I THINK. THAT REPARATIONS ARE A GOOD THING AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE ON THAT SO I'LL BE WERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. TO THIS BUT I JUST WANTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT THAT IS A NEW OCCASION WHERE 95% WERE IN AGREEMENT AND WE'RE- DISAGREEING ON TO. HELP GET THAT LAST 5% THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS. THANK YOU WAS BECAUSE ALSO I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS FOCUSING ON A DARK HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE COMPLICITY IN IT HISTORICALLY BECAUSE AS MR OBERNOLTE IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THE HOW COME FROM SLAVERY AND DE DE HUMANIZATION OF AN ENTIRE RACE OF PEOPLE HAS LED TO A LOT OF POLICIES THAT PEOPLE TODAY WE THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH TODAY. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION WE IT THIS CASE DISCRIMINATION WE HAVE SET PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THIS HISTORIC PATTERN. BEHIND WAY AND THE REST OF THIS STATE HAS BEEN MOVING FORWARD THOSE ARE VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO HAVE AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF REPARATIONS ARE OR HOW WE ADDRESS THOSE ECONOMIC. DISCRIMINATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IT IS A VERY HARD QUESTION BUT WE CANNOT HONESTLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES IN CALIFORNIA IT WITHOUT HAVING THAT CONVERSATION IN FACT IF WE STOP TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON RATES. IN POLICY THEN IT'S THE RACISTS WHO WINTHOSE CONVERSATIONS SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF IT I DO APPRECIATE MR CLARK'S. THOUGHTFUL AND DEEP ANALYSIS OF THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR COMMITTEE THANK YOU AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE AND I A IN SOME IS. IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO APOLOGIZE BUT I DID TRY TO. YOU WOULD NOT OF SAID YOU BELIEVE WITH 95% OF MY FIRST DRAFT OF THE THROAT. HE SAID. AND I DID REALIZE THAT. WE COME FROM WE ALL COME FROM THIS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HAVING BEEN INFORMED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT IN THIS I TRIED VERY HARD I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING YOU KNOW THIS THIS WOULD SIMPLY SUPPORT A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A COMMISSION TO SUPPORT TICKET TO PRODUCE A RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD THEN CREATE MORE YOU KNOW AND WOULD HAVE TO THEN GO TO THE CONGRESS AND SO I TRIED TO BE CLEAR. THAT IT AND YOU KNOW SELECT THE IN ONE TOWN NOT EVEN SAY THAT WAS YOU KNOW AN ECONOMIC REPARATIONS I HONESTLY LIKE STARTED WITH FORTY ACRES AND A MULE. PLUS INTEREST. FOOTBALL AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES SO IN IN THAT SENSE I DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THE RESOLUTION AT ALL I I'M SORRY I CAN'T GET TO ON THIS BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AT LEAST IN THAT RESPECT I RESPECT LASSEN ABOUT THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS THAT A D. R. TWENTY ONE BE ADOPTED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAU CHIU GONZALEZ I CONSULT AYE HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN HI MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO PETRIE-NORRIS RADIUS. I. WE NEED TO MORE I'M GONNA PUT THAT BILL OR THE RESOLUTION ON CALL. ALRIGHT MR TANG SPRING SAYS TO AJ ARE TWENTY TWO. OUR ITEM NUMBER THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HR TWENTY TWO RECOGNIZES DECEMBER SEVENTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN AS A SEVENTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPEAL OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND ALSO CALLED UPON THE PRESIDENT TO RESCIND HIS ANTI IMMIGRANT AND ANTI MUSLIM EXECUTIVE ORDERS AS YOU RECALL THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WAS THE COUNTRY'S FIRST LAW PROHIBITING. IMMIGRATION SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF ETHNICITY TO PREVENT A CHINESE LABORS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY DESPITE THE MANY YEARS OF THE LABORS TOILED ON THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD IN THIS IS A VERY HISTORIC YOUR BECAUSE WE ALSO CELEBRATING THE HISTORY THE UNIVERSITY OF THAT TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD AS WELL. AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A STAIN ON OUR US HISTORY AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO REMEMBER THIS ACT WITHOUT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS. KEEP THIS PLACE. HI MANY PLEASE A CHEER FROM ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT EIGHT ARE TWENTY TWO. ADVANCINGJUSTICE CALIFORNIA'S A PARTNERSHIP OF THE ASIAN LAW CAUCUS AND ADVANCING JUSTICE LOS ANGELES WE ADVOCATE FOR THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN. PACIFIC ISLANDER AND OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE FAIR AND EQUITABLE SOCIETY FOR ALL. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT CHESTER A. ARTHUR ON MAY SIXTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE ACT WAS INITIALLY INTENDED TO LAST FOR TEN YEARS. BUT IT WAS RENEWED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO WITH THE GARY ACT AND THEN MADE PERMANENT IN NINETEEN OH TWO. SEVEN YEARS PRIOR TO THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT THE AGE ACT HAD SET A PRECEDENT BY BANNING CHINESE WOMAN FROM IMMIGRATING TO THE US. SO THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT SERVES AS A REMINDER THAT OUR NATION HOWEVER INCREMENTALLY UNDER NATIONALIST AGENDAS. CAN DECONSTRUCT OUR AMERICAN VALUES OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL IN FAVOR OF. FEAR AND XENA PHOBIA. AJ ARE TWENTY TWO IS TIMELY BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT A LINK BETWEEN THE RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS ANIMOSITY OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDERS. TO DATE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUSPENDED THE ENTRY OF ALL REFUGEES UNDER THE US REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS SOUGHT TO HAVE THE NUMBER OF ACCEPTED REFUGEES INTO OUR COUNTRY SUSPENDED ENTRY OF IMMIGRANTS AND SOME CLASSES OF NON IMMIGRANTS FROM SEVERAL MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES. DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO HIRE TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS EMPOWERED STATES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS OF IMMIGRATION OFFICERS AND BROADLY EXPANDED THE CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE CLASSIFIED AS PRIORITIES FOR REMOVAL. AS ASIAN AMERICANS WE CELEBRATE THE REPEAL OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT BUT WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TO DISMANTLE THE RACIST CLASSES AND ENOUGH OF IT POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TO PLAGUE OUR COUNTRY. SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. RIGHT SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SCOUTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FOR THE MEASURE AYE I THINK THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE TALKING. A LOT MORE ABOUT IN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF WHAT OCCURRED THERE I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. THAT THIS REALLY CAME OUT OF CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS AND THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH AN IMPETUS BEHIND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I BELIEVE IT WAS. WHICH IS STILL OUR CONSTITUTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. CAME OUT OF THAT SAME CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IS LARGELY INFLUENCED OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE WORKING MAN'S PARTY HAD COME TO POWER AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS. IN THE STATE WHO WHO PUT THAT INTO PLACE AND LARGELY BECAUSE THEY- THEY DID NOT LIKE. THAT CHINESE IMMIGRANTS CAME HERE AND WORK FOR LOWER WAGES. THAN THEMSELVES VERY HIGHLY LABOR INFLUENCED. INFLUENCE MOVEMENT AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE HISTORY. BEHIND THAT AND RECOGNIZE THE SINGS FOR WHAT FOR WHAT IT WAS I THINK WE NEED TO BRING THOSE ACCURATE DEPICTIONS OF WHAT OCCURRED THERE ARE STILL STREETS AND BUILDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO NAMED AFTER SOME OF THESE FOLKS. WHO ADVOCATED FOR CHINESE EXCLUSION. I DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT THAT YEAH I KNOW IT FOR A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT STATUES AND THINGS. I DON'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT IN IN REGARD TO THIS SO I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH. APP THAT WE- YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THAT HISTORY AND TALK ABOUT THINGS TODAY. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS RESOLUTION AS YOU WILL NOTE OF COURSES THAT I REALLY DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS WHICH ARE LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE SECURITY THREATS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED NOT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT BY THE CIA AND BY OUR SECURITY AGENCIES. THE SAID HEY THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE LET IN OUR COUNTRY FOR SECURITY PURPOSES NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT SOMEONE'S RACES ARE WHAT BECOMES WHAT SOMEONE'S RELIGION IS. SO I THINK TO CONFLATE THOSE THINGS TO ME UNDERMINES. THE VERY REAL THINGS THAT HAPPENED. IN THAT HISTORY. AND WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AND BE VERY WARY AGAINST. TRULY XENOPHOBIC ANTI RELIGIOUS. BIGOTRY THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR PASS AND- I AGREE WITH THE NEED TO BE EVER VIGILANT AGAINST IT. BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO USE THIS AS KIND OF A POLITICAL. AGENDA I THINK WE NEED TO USE AS A TEACHING MOMENT AND WE AYE WE MAY JUST DISAGREE ON THAT AND THAT'S FINE THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IN THIS BODY. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE IT AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE MEASURE. THE COMMENTS. QUESTIONS THING NONE THANK YOU MISTER TANG AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IF WE DON'T. STATICALLY DISCUSS OUR PAST WE ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT AND I THINK THAT CONNECTION I DISAGREE WITH MR GALLAGHER THE CONNECTION WITH THE EXAMPLES THAT HE BROUGHT UP ARE EXACTLY A POINT WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING ON. THE NATIONAL STAGE RIGHT NOW WITH THE XENOPHOBIA AND RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION EVEN UNDER THE GUISE OF NATURAL NATIONAL SECURITY WHICH IS PROVING TO NOT NOT BE TRUE WHATSOEVER. SO THE LESSONS FROM THE PAST IF WE DON'T LEARN FROM THEM AND IF WE DON'T DISCUSS THEM AND IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM THAN THOSE WHO WOULD WANT TO REPEAT THEM AND SUPPORT THE REPETITION OF THOSE ACTS. ULTIMATELY WHEN. VISITING YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK THE VICE CHAIR FOR HIS COMMENTS AS WELL ESPECIALLY THE HOPING PART WHERE HE OBVIOUSLY DOES DESCRIBE THE HISTORIC SITUATION AND THAT HE'S ACTUALLY WRITE THAT MUCH OF IT DID EMANATE FROM. SAN FRANCISCO FROM A- FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO WORK IN LABOR AND WERE FEARING FOR THEIR ARE WORKING CLASS JOBS AND SAW IMMIGRATION AS COMPETITION. AND MUCH OF THAT TONE IS STILL I THINK VERY CONSISTENT TODAY WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF. WORKING CLASS AMERICANS WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN FEAR OF WHAT'S COMING OR WHAT IS HERE AND HOW IT IMPACTS THEIR LIVELIHOOD THEIR ABILITY TO WORK AND- MAKE A LIVING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS IN TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY THESE ARE ALL. I'M VERY NORMAL I THINK INSTINCTS I THINK WHAT. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OFF. AND I FULLY APPRECIATE THE NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION BUT- WILL BE SEEN IS IN TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN WE- ARE BROAD BRUSH OR OR TAKE A BRUSH TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WERE WITH THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY AND WE HAVE ALL THESE COMPACT TO REGRET. IT IN A PROGRAM THAT WITH THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION SHOP. CAN BE HEARD. HE IS THE PRESENTER TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DANGEROUS AND YOU WOULD HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT I THINK EVERYONE'S FULL SUPPORT THAT THOSE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED OUR COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO. ON PREVENT THEIR ENTRANCE HAVING SAID THAT TO HAVE A BROAD CATEGORY OF ANY PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WE'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER TIME WE ARE WE'VE HAD. IRISH IMMIGRANTS ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS VERY. VARIOUS GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THEIR EARLY. STAGES OF THEIR IMMIGRATION WHO WERE PAINTED WITH. A BRUSH THAT WAS ANTI AMERICAN AND WHAT WE'VE COME TO. SEE IS THAT REALLY WERE ALL AMERICAN NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE ALL. BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PRINCIPLE WE ALL WANT TO BE PART OF THIS AMERICAN DREAM AND THAT ULTIMATELY IS REALLY WHAT HOLD OUR COUNTRY.

FORTY FOUR IS ADOPTED ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR TAKES US TO OUR LAST ITEM ACR ONE TEN THIS WEEK'S. WELCOME. THANK YOU. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED TO MAKE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY INCLUDING THE CHOICE ON WHETHER TO TERMINATE A PREGNANCY UNFORTUNATELY RECENT STATE LAWS THAT RESTRICT ABORTION HAVE BECOME SO EXTREME THAT THEY THREATEN THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO LIVE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THEIR BORDERS. ADDITIONALLY MANY OF THE STATES THAT HAVE PASSED EXTREME ABORTION BAN LAWS AND TWENTY NINETEEN HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY SUCH RESTRICTIONS WILL FURTHER ENDANGER WOMEN'S HEALTH ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME WOMEN INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY RESTRICTING ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE AS ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE START NATIONALLY CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE BY STANDING UP. FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL PEOPLE. ACR ONE TEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. BY DECLARING CALIFORNIA A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE FOR ALL ACR ONE TEN WILL REAFFIRM OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO GUARANTEEING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. IT'S TO FULLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO AN ABORTION FOR WOMEN AND PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS I WILL HAVE MY WITNESS SELF INTRODUCED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR SUCH AS PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS AMY EVERITT I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SPECIAL PROJECTS IN A ROW PRO CHOICE AMERICA. AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR STATE DIRECTOR SHANNON HOPE IT. NARAL PRO CHOICE AMERICA IS THE GRASSROOTS NATIONAL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING. OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT HAS TWO POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HEARING CALIFORNIA. IN EVERY COUNTY. COULD YOU SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE MICROPHONE SO WE HAVE YOU ON OUR RECORD. WITH THAT HE BETTER. THANK YOU YES. AT NAY ROW WE DON'T OPERATE AND WE DON'T LITIGATE. WE LEAVE THAT TRY ALLY THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THE ACLU. WE ORGANIZE AND WE MOBILIZED TO LIKE PRO CHOICE CANDIDATES AND HAVE PROACTIVE PRO CHOICE LEGISLATION. NEVER WORKS TO GUARANTEE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING THE FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES. INCLUDING PREVENTING UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. BEARING HEALTHY CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN ABORTION CARE. BUT LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN. IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE PACKED THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WITH ANTI CHOICE STRUCTURE. AND STATE LEGISLATORS ARE RESPONDING TO THE REALITY. THAT THE PROTECTIONS OF ROE VERSUS WADE WILL BE OVERTURNING GOT IT. CRIMINALIZING AND PUNISHING WOMEN WHO ACCESS THE PORTION CARE AND THE DOCTORS WHO PROVIDE THAT CARE. ALREADY THIRTY STATES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO BAN ABORTION WHETHER IT IS AN OHIO AND GEORGETTE WITH BANDS THAT SIX WEEKS OR DAYS TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA WHICH TOTALED ABORTION BANS WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE OR INCEST. AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ALL THE RELENTLESSLY ATTACKED WOMEN'S DIGNITY TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY. MOST RECENTLY THEY HAVE IMPOSED A DOMESTIC GAG RULE. ON ACT FIFTEEN ABORTION CARE AT BIRTH AT PLACES THAT DEFENSE BIRTH CONTROL INTERFERING BETWEEN THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR LEGAL AND SAFE ABORTION CARE. WE HAVE BEEN LEADING POLICIES TO EXPAND ACCESS AND ENSURE DIGNITY AND HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE PREGNANCIES AND THOSE WHO TERMINATE PREGNANCIES. BUT IF THE OTHER STATES AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE TO THROW UP OBSTACLES TO ABORTION CARE AMBER AND TO BIRTH CONTROL ACCESS WOMEN AND PREGNANT PEOPLE WILL TURN TO THE PEAK AND THAT IS CALIFORNIA. MANY PERJURY STATES ARE STEPPING UP TO MEET THE NEW REALITY IF A POST ROH WORLD AND CALIFORNIA AGAIN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD. THE RESOLUTION TO DECLARE CALIFORNIA REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE FOR ALL. IT'S A POWERFUL STEP TO FOLLOW GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S PROCLAMATION A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. AND IT IS THE PROMISE THAT WE WILL DOUBLE DOWN TO ENSURE. THAT REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS IS EXPANDED AND SUPPORTED. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE BEST PRO CHOICE LIFE IN THE COUNTRY WE CAN STILL DO MORE. WE HAVE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND THANK YOU BUT POLICIES PASSED IN SACRAMENTO THAT WOMEN AND PREGNANT PEOPLE ON THE STREET DON'T KNOW ABOUT DON'T MATTER WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF ENSURING. THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND WHAT THEIR ACCESS TO LOOK LIKE. 43% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY HOSPITAL ABORTION CLINIC. WHICHMEANS THAT THERE ARE WEEKS AND MONTHS WE'LL WAITING PERIODS BEFORE WOMEN AND PREGNANT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS CARE NO MATTER WHERE HEY ARE WHETHER IT IS IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. OR IN RURAL CALIFORNIA SOME CALIFORNIA HAVE TO TRAVEL MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES ACCESS CARE. SO LET'S BE CLEAR SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS SUPPORT THE LEGAL ACCESS TO ABORTION. THIS CUTS ACROSS. ALL STATE. ALL POLITICAL PARTY LINE. ALL RELIGIOUS LINES ALSO SHOW ECONOMIC LEVELS ALL RACIAL LEVELS. EIGHT IN TEN CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA EEL THE SAME WAY AND EITHER EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION THEY DO NOT WANT OBSTACLES TO THAT CARE. WOMEN IN THEIR FAMILY THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY DON'T DESERVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR A POLITICAL AGENDA I AM PROUD TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF EIGHT THE ART WHEN TEN. AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEE NONE AS THEIR OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU IS TOGETHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I THINK THE AUTHOR. I THINK THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MEN AND OTHERS SENSITIVE BUT I MEAN I JUST THINK THE CHARACTERIZATION. WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND I THINK LARGE THE WHAT. THEY'RE FOCUSING IN ON HIS THIRD TRIMESTER ABORTIONS. AND ROW ITSELF ACTUALLY LAID OUT THE FOUNDATION THAT STATES COULD DO MORE. IN THAT THIRD TRIMESTER TO PROTECT WHAT WHAT IS A VIABLE. FETUS AND TO HAVE THAT BALANCE. THAT REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF THE MOTHER AND THE RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN CHILD. BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; CARA&lt;/c&gt; CATEGORIZED AS RADICAL I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE A CARROT CATEGORIZES RADICAL THIRD TRIMESTER ABORTIONS. I THINK THEY WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS RADICAL THE STATEMENTS OF THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR. THAT A BABY COULD BE EVEN ABORTED EVEN AFTER IT'S BEEN DELIVERED. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE VERY RADICAL THINGS AND I THINK WHAT A LOT OF THESE STATES ARE TRYING TO DO IS RECOGNIZE WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IS THAT. WE ARE DEALING WITH PROTECTING WOMEN'S RIGHTS BUT WERE ALSO HAVING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER LIFE. AT ISSUE HERE AND THAT WE DO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR AND ROW ACTUALLY LAID THAT OUT AND YOU KNOW THE AND SO LOOK A LOT OF THAT DISCUSSION I THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I THINK IT SHOULD HAPPEN AND PRODUCTIVE ANNA. IN A REASONED AWAY YOU KNOW. AS OPPOSED TO A REAL ANTAGONISTIC WAY AS IT TENDS TO END UP. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I ALSO YOU KNOW. I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT FOR NAY ROUTE TO COME IN HERE AND SAY SOME OF THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY PARTICULARLY HAVE GONE AFTER CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS IN THE STATE AND VIOLATED ATTEMPTED TO VIOLATE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THEY ARE RUNNING LEGISLATURE AND WE COULD STAY ON THE TITLE WERE IT NOT GO AFTER THE WE ARE ON TOP OF THESE ISSUES THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDERED AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE TWO YEARS AGO WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO SHUT DOWN THE SPEECH RIGHTS. AND ABILITY OF CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS WHO I KNOW FOR A FACT. OUR WITH WOMEN ON THE STREET EVERY DAY HELPING THEM TO CRISIS PREGNANCIES AND HAVE BEEN A GREAT RESOURCE. TO PEOPLE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY THE RESOURCES THAT YOU AGREE WITH. THAT YOU WANT TO TRY AND HELP PROMOTE AND ADVOCATE FOR BUT YOU'RE PERFECTLY FINE TAKEN AWAY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. OF OTHERS WHO MAYBE DON'T SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE A PRO LIFE GROUPS BUT VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE IN CRISIS PREGNANCIES. AND SO YOU CAN'T REALLY HAVE IT BOTH WAYS NOW CAN YOU. AND I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD STAND UP FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE. AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST I'D. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE WAY THIS IS BEING CHARACTERIZED IS NOT ACCURATE AS ALL IS ON SALE. THIS CAR. ASSEMBLY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND TO CHARACTERIZE WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING IS SIMPLY HAVING A DEBATE. OVER THE TIME. OF THE IT IS I THINK THE REQUEST THE REALITY IS THEY WANT TO HAVE ABORTION BAN THEY WANT TO TAKE CHOICE AWAY FROM WOMEN THEY'RE TAKING FUNDING AWAY THERE'S MANY STATES. WE TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE SOME STATES WERE A YET TO LITERALLY GO OTHER STATE. IN ORDER TO GET THE CLOSEST MOST CONVENIENT TEST. I AND SO. AND. IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR WOMEN IT SHOULD BE THERE RIGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHAT ALL THE OPTIONS ARE BEFORE THEM. AND IT'S VERY SCARY BECAUSE THIS COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ALL THE WAY DOWN. THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO. IS EITHER WE BELIEVE IN TRUSTS WOMEN ARE NOT AND FRANKLY AND MOST OF THE STATE'S AND INCLUDING IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS OUR MAN FOR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. AND ADMITS APPALLING. AND SO IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT IT AS SOME KIND OF POLITICAL DEBATE AND WHAT HAVE YOU THE REALITY IS THAT WOMEN'S LIVES ARE ON THE LINE WITH HIS CHOICE IS BEING STRIPPED AWAY.
