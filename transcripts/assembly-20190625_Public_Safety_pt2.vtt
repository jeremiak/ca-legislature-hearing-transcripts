TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE FIRST

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.674

TRANSPORTATION PROVISIONS OF THE

BILL -- WILL SPREE SHOULD THE

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.411
COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO NARROW

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:21.979
THE SCOPE OF THE BILL I EVEN

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.114
FURTHER HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.448
OP WILL TELL YOU WE STILL HAVE

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:25.783
TO ANYTHING BIG OUTSTANDING

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.884
CONCERNS.

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.586
THE FIRST IS THAT EXISTING LAW

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.254
PROVIDES -- THE AUTHORITY FOR

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:32.290
SHERIFF -- RUNNING A JAIL TO

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.392
ALLOW A PROGRAM WHERE BY

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:35.826
SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.395
RELEASED A CERTAIN TIME TO STAY

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:39.330
AN EXTRA -- SEVERAL HOURS IN

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.065
ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THAT --

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.667
CHANGE UNTIL YOU GET TO A A

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:44.302
MORNING TIME OR SOME OTHER OF

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:45.770
POINT WHEN IT'S NOT -- AT NIGHT

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:46.871
TIME OR WHEN IT WHEN IT'S NOT

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:48.506
COLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.507
TO BE RELEASED AND SO THAT'S

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.275
EXISTING LAW THAT THAT MAY BE

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.944
OFFERED THIS WOULD MANDATE --

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:58.282
THAT THAT PROGRAM BE OFFERED --

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.150
IF A PERSON CHOOSES NOT TO AVAIL

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.785
THEMSELVES OF THAT OPTION THEN

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.219
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE OFFERED A

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.955
SAFE PLACE TO STAY SO PRESUMABLY

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.990
A NON CUSTODIAL ENVIRONMENT SO

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.025
EITHER -- CUSTODIAL OR NON

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.860
CUSTODIAL WAITING ROOM STILL IN

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:11.963
THE JAIL -- ONE OF THOSE OR BOTH

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:13.297
OF THOSE OPTIONS HAVE TO BE

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.166
PROVIDED UNDER THIS BILL -- SO

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:17.001
THAT CREATES OBVIOUSLY COST

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.603
PRESSURES AND MANDATES -- THE

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:19.870
SECOND PART OF THE BILL IS THE

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.739
REQUIREMENT THAT A PERSON WHO'S

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.074
BEEN IN CUSTODY FOR THIRTY DAYS

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.342
OR LONGER BE RELEASED WITH AT

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.910
LEAST THREE DAYS MEDICATION.

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:26.677
WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.212
DESIRE FOR PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.747
WITH MEDICINE IT'S NOT -- IN

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:31.382
OPPOSITION TO THAT THERE IS VERY

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:32.817
LITTLE LIMITATION EVEN WITH THE

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.619
BILL'S AMENDMENTS ARE ON WHAT

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:36.187
TYPES OF MEDICATIONS WOULD BE

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:38.456
RELEASED WITH THE PERSON -- THE

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:39.957
COULD BE MEDICINE THAT NEEDS TO

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.726
BE TAKEN UNDER SUPERVISION -- IT

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.160
COULD BE SOMETHING NECESSARY

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.662
LIKE INSULIN OR IT COULD BE AN

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.731
OPIATE -- ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.532
EASILY ABUSED ONE OF THOSE IS

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.002
NOT -- SO I THINK THIS THERE

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:52.670
COULD BE GREATER SPECIFICITY AND

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:54.271
CLARITY ABOUT.

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.774
WHAT TYPES OF MEDICATIONS ARE

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:57.775
RELEASED?

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:58.309
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:58.909
PURPOSE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.011
FOR BOTH OF THESE THINGS WE

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.178
THINK THEY BRING LIABILITY TO

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:01.946
COUNTIES.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.115
IN AS MUCH AS THEY'D BE MANDATED

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.883
TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BE ALLOWED

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.785
TO STAY OR TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.487
MEDICATIONS AS THEY DEPART THE

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.355
FACILITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:12.590
WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:13.591
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:14.992

VERY POWERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU --

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.719
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.988
TRAGEDY OF THE DEATH OF JUST ST

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:45.523
LOUIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN THE

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:47.491
CATALYST OF THIS -- BUT I'M

CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THE BILL.

00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:57.768
YES.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:58.202
YES.

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.137
A MARKET OF I TO WANT TO THANK

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:01.806
SENATOR SCANNER -- FOR BRINGING

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:04.842
THIS BILL FORWARD AND ALSO WOULD --

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.211
BE HONORED TO JOIN ON AS A CO

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.547
AUTHOR -- AS A CHAIR OF THE

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.482
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INCARCERATED

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:13.284
WOMEN I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.051
AN ISSUE WORTH FURTHER

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:16.387
EXPLORATION IN THAT COMMITTEE SO

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:17.521
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:18.923
ABOUT AN UNVEILED.

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.958
I'M ALL OF THE TRAUMAS I MEAN

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.827
CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED BY --

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:24.862
IN PARTICULAR WOMEN -- AND GIRLS

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:27.298
WHO ARE INCARCERATED -- I

00:39:27.364 --> 00:39:29.300
ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT FOLKS

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.569
WHO ARE RELEASED WANT TO SPEND

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:35.039
ADDITIONAL TIME -- IN JAIL ARE

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.173
IN PRISON I THINK THEY WANT TO

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.710
GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN --

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.645
SPEAKING TO THE OPPOSITION BUT

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:44.048
IT'S MAKING SURE THAT -- THOSE

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.382
MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE RELEASED

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.751
ARE RELEASED IN A WAY THAT IS

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:48.652
SAFE -- AND THAT BRINGS WITH THE

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.421
DIGNITY BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.623
WANT IS TO SEE FOLKS GOING IN OR

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.191
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:55.526
PEOPLE FURTHER ATTACKED OR EVEN

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:56.193
KILLED.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.228
AND AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.596
MEDICATION I WAS THINKING

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:00.397
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:02.366
THE TESTIMONY OF OTHER WOMEN WHO

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.901
SHARED THAT IT WOULD ALSO BE

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.369
WONDERFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.971
WOMEN ARE GIVEN I'M A COUPLE OF

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.439
DAYS WORTH OF PERSONAL HYGIENE

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.206
PRODUCTS.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.374
YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.809
MEDICATION BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:12.877
ELSE TO KIND OF HAVE SOME OF THE

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.211
PRODUCTS THAT YOU NEED AS YOU'RE

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.179
GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD AND

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.213
TRYING TO GET SETTLED.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.615
SO I DON'T HAVE THAT MIGHT BE A

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.849
LITTLE TOO LATE TO PUT IN BUT I

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.017
WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:20.885
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.153
CONSIDERED BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.053
THIS IS ABOUT.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.458
YOU KNOW HOW WE TREAT ALL FOLKS

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.894
WITH DIGNITY.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.895
THANK YOU HER ANY OTHER COMMENT

YOU MAY CLOSE -- THANK YOU

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:35.833
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I'M

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.701
HAPPY TO ADD TO REQUESTED CO

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.670
AUTHORS AND I FORGOT TO OPEN

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.505
WITH THAT I AM TAKING MIDIS.

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.807
TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.275
AMENDMENTS.

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.243
AND TO THE POINTER ON THE

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.812
MEDICATIONS THE LANGUAGE IN THE

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.280
BILL DOES SAY ESSENTIAL

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:54.218
MEDICATIONS -- SO I A AND IF WE

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.820
THINK ABOUT IT IF.

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.054
IF A PERSON FOR EXAMPLE IS

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.490
DIABETIC AND THEY ARE RELEASED

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.725
AT A TIME WHERE.

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:04.829
WE AND THEY HAVE NO BUT THAT YOU

00:41:04.895 --> 00:41:05.830
KNOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE ON THEIR

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.565
PERSON THEIR PRESCRIPTION OR ANY

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:08.532
OF THAT.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.367
THEN THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.303
ABILITY TO IMMEDIATELY GET THAT

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.938
ESSENTIAL MEDICATION THAT THEY

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:15.840
NEED SO I THINK THAT'S VERY --

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:18.676
NECESSARY AND IN TERMS OF THE

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:21.078
THAT IT ISN'T STATUTE ALREADY

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.880
FOR JAILS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.148
A PERSON.

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:25.449
THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.084
RELEASED AT A DIFFERENT TIME --

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.653
IF WE TAKE THE OUR TESTIMONY FOR

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.223
MISS NAVARRO'S SHE WASN'T MAY

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:34.525
DATE WASN'T GIVEN THAT OFFER --

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.560
AND SO IT'S MAYBE THERE ARE SOME

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:39.263
OF OUR COUNTY JAILS THAT ARE

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.365
AVAILING -- THERE -- FOLKS OF

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.168
THAT BUT IT'S NOT WELL KNOWN AND

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:50.140
IT'S NOT AS FAR AS WE COULD --

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:51.275
GET INFORMATION ON BEING

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.943
UTILIZED AND THEN THE LAST THING

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.144
THAT LAST POINT I'D MAKE AND I

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.546
AM REALLY REALLY AM PROUD OF

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:56.914
MISSING OF OURS.

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:58.883
FOR HAVING THE GOOD SENSE NUMBER

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:01.218
ONE NOT GO WITH THE OTHER WOMEN

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.487
WHO WERE RELEASED -- TO WHERE

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:04.922
SHE MIGHT BE.

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:06.357
EXPOSED TO DRUGS AND WHETHER SHE

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:07.758
USE THEM HERSELF FOR NOT SHE

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:09.293
COULD HAVE BEEN AND SUBJECT TO

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.928
ARREST AGAIN.

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:14.298
OR IT -- IT IT IN THE CASE OF

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.634
MANY OTHER PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.269
THEY IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCE AN

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.771
OVERDOSE BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT HAD.

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.907
DRUGS IN THE NAY OR IMMEDIATELY --

00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:25.376
GIVEN THEM BUT SHE HAD THE GOOD

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:27.645
SENSE NOT TO DO THAT AND YET

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.382
JUST HOW WHAT A KIND OF MIRACLE

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:33.217
THAT SHE HAPPENED TO READ MISTER

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.019
BURTON'S BOOK AND CONTACTED MS

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.320
BURTON AND HAD SOMEONE THAT

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.621
WOULD COME AND PICK HER UP.

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.189
THAT IS A RARE THING TO HAVE

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:40.824
HAPPEN AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.259
WHERE OUR JAILS ARE SITUATED

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:43.527
BELIEVE ME.

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.696
ANYONE HANG AROUND OUR JAILS IN

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:47.731
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS NOT

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:48.766
HANG AROUND FOR A GOOD PERSON

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.434
COULD PURPOSE THEY'RE USUALLY

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.269
PREDATORY INDIVIDUALS WHETHER

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.737
THEY'RE ENGAGED IN HUMAN

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.472
TRAFFICKING OR WHETHER THEY'RE

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.408
ENGAGED IN DRUG DEALING OR ANY

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.575
NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS.

00:42:58.642 --> 00:42:59.977
THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:02.546
THAT HANG AROUND JAILS SO THE

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:03.580
ONE OF THE OWNER OF A PERSON IS

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.316
RELEASED THAT PERSON IS

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.717
IMMEDIATELY PUT AT RISK.

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:09.186
SO I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A LOT

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.121
OF SENSE I APPRECIATE -- BEING

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:13.424
ABLE TO PRESENT IT TO ACCEPT THE

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.359
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WITH THAT

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:19.930
I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.099
IN THANK YOU AND I AND I HOPE.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:24.168
THAT -- THE SHERIFF IN THE RURAL

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:26.270
COUNTIES WILL WORK WITH.

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.204
WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND MAYBE

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.540
NINETY NINE POINT 99% OF THE

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.108
DETAILS DO.

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:31.842
OFFER AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:32.843
DON'T PUT PEOPLE OUT INCLEMENT

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.211
WEATHER AND THINGS THAT NATURE

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.679
BUT IT ONLY TAKES ONE AND

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.915
HOPEFULLY YOU LOOK AT THIS I

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.917
KNOW WE USE MAY VERSUS SHALL.

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.919
AND I THINK.

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.721
IF YOU'RE DOING IT ALREADY.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.923
DAN SHALL IS NOT GOING TO BE A

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.725
PROBLEM.

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.793
IN PART TWO I AM THE INSULIN I I

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.095
UNDERSTAND.

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:54.064
BUT ALSO THE LOOK I I I SEE A

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:54.965
LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE.

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:56.300
IN LOS ANGELES.

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.769
MANY OF THEM I BELIEVE DO NEED

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.804
PSYCHOTROPIC SOME OF THEM DIDN'T

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.706
GET IT WHEN THEY LEFT PRISON

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:03.574
THEY HAD IT WHEN THEY WERE IN

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.541
PRISON.

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.510
AND SO I'M NOT.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:09.113
TOO UPSET IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:10.214
MUST ENOUGH SUPPLIES SO THAT

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.716
THEY CAN DEAL WITH REALITY WHEN

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:13.317
THEY GET OUT OTHERWISE HE MAY

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.251
END UP IN.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.020
BEING HOMELESS AND OTHER THINGS

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:18.422
AND SO -- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.324
MAKE SURE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.059
OR OTHER ROLE COUNTIES.

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:23.160
URBAN COUNTIES OR ANYTHING.

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:26.230
OF THAT NATURE BUT IN SOME CASES

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.564
SOME PEOPLE MAY NEED.

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.166
SOME OF THOSE DRUGS JUST TO BE

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.768
ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE DAY WHEN

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:33.871
THEY GET OUT -- AND SO -- WITH

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:37.941
THAT CHEERS RECOMMEND IN I ON SB

FOR THE PURPOSE OF IT IS REALLY

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:23.287
IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP A

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.688
FAMILY INTACT.

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:30.360

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:33.063
SO MANY -- IT.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.365

REASONS TO DO OUR BEST TO KEEP

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.643
THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:54.651
COURT FOR PRIMARY CARE GIVERS TO

DEPENDENTS NO ONLY SAY PEOPLE

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.491
DEPENDENCY DOES NOT ONLY HAVE TO

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:01.792
BE A PERSON WITH CHILDREN.

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.961
IT CAN BE A PERSON WHO IS THE

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.329

ELDERLY PARENT OR SOMEONE ELSE.

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:10.567
AND IF THEY ARE.

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:14.071
INSTEAD INCARCERATED THEN THE

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.739
PEOPLE THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON

THEM IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN ARE

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.809
OFTEN PUT IN OUR FOSTER SYSTEM

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.944

FOSTER CHILDREN IS NOT ARE NOT

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.882
GREAT -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.850
OTHER PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THAT

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.952
THEIR CARE GIVER IS REMOVED

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.154
THERE THAT HAS SERIOUS

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.257
IMPLICATIONS. FOR THOSE PEOPLE

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.791

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.638
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.473
THERE'S JUDICIAL DISCRETION BUT

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.674
WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE THE

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.376
OPPORTUNITY FOR PRE TRIAL

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:53.710
DIVERSION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.646
WOULD QUALIFY. TO BE ABLE TO

AS PARENTS I'M SURE YOU CAN

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:18.135
AGREE THAT THERE'S ALMOST NO

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.303
PAIN GREATER THAN THAT OF SEEING

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:21.038
YOUR CHILD SUFFER AND NOT BE

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.739
ABLE TO HELP.

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:24.308
MY LIFE UP UNTIL I FOUND OUT

00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:25.776
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A MOTHER

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.344

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:29.079
FULL OF POVERTY PAIN ABUSE AND

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:30.914
ABANDONMENT.

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.349
MY DAUGHTER LITERALLY SAVED ME

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.184
FROM THAT LIFE.

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:35.319
FROM THE MOMENT THAT I FOUND OUT

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:37.321
I WAS PREGNANT.

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:39.056
I COMPLETELY COMMITTED MYSELF TO

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.090
CREATING THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.892
FOR HER.

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:42.826
UNFORTUNATELY I FAILED IN DOING

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:44.728
SO.

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:46.296
THE DECISIONS A MISTAKE THAT I

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.931
HAD MADEUP UNTIL THAT POINT HAD

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:49.499
CAUGHT UP TO ME AND I WAS

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.401
INDICTED ON DRUG CHARGES WHEN MY

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:52.002
DAUGHTER WAS JUST EIGHT MONTHS

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.337
OLD.

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.938
I SPENT THE FOLLOWING THREE

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.039
YEARS FIGHTING TO PROVE TO THE

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.474
COURTS MY COMMUNITY AND TO

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.809
MYSELF.

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.143
THAT I WAS MORE THAN JUST MY

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.678
MISTAKES.

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.213
I WORK TWO JOBS BECAME A

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.148
CELEBRATED EMPLOYEE AND ROLLED

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.618
IN SCHOOL ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.186
IN GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:11.054
TO ORGANIZING DRIVES AND RAISING

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.756
MONEY FOR LOCAL CAUSES.

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:14.625
I ATTENDED THERAPY REGULARLY

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.026
COMPLIED WITH EVERY SINGLE

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.894
STIPULATION THAT PROBATION AND

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:20.097
PRETRIAL SET FORTH BEFORE MEET

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.932
WITH NOT ONE SINGLE VIOLATION.

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.467
THIRTY DRUG TEST OR SO MUCH AS A

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:26.003
TRAFFIC TICKET IN THREE YEARS.

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.237
WHEN I WENT BEFORE THE JUDGE FOR

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:28.472
SENTENCING AND ASKED THAT HE

00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:30.007
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MY EFFORTS AND

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.775
PROVEN CHANGE OVER THE PAST

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.943
THREE YEARS?

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.211
I WAS TOLD THAT WHILE ALL THAT

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:37.414
WAS GREAT I HAD TO PAY.

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.316
THE REALITY OF HIS STATEMENT WAS

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:41.485
THAT MY DAUGHTER HAD TO PAY.

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:43.520
MY MOTHER HAD TO PAY AND I WOULD

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.889
NEVER BE DONE PAYING.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.691
MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER O'MARA WHO

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.092
WAS JUST SITTING ON MY LAP.

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:50.327

HER GOODBYE AT THE PRISON GATES

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:57.934
I WOULDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR THE

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.836
NEXT FOUR YEARS.

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.371
THE AFFECTS OF MY INCARCERATION

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.806
HAVE HAD RIPPLES FAR GREATER

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.308
THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE.

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.942

INCARCERATION CAM REALIZE?

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:09.146
AND THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OF

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:10.013
THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.050
INCARCERATION LAND ON OUR BABIES.

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:15.919

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:20.057
NOT BY ALLOWING MOTHERS AND

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.825
FATHERS TO GET OFF SCOT FREE BUT

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:22.893

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.092
LENGTH.

00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:57.727
IF HERE SHE CAN SHOW THAT HERE

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.596
SHE IS THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER OF

ONE PARENT IS A PRIMARY CARE

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:07.971
GIVER IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL.

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.706

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.608
OTHER PARENT IS THE FINANCIAL

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.209
SUPPORT IT APPEARS THAT BOTH

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:16.179
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.747
UNDER THIS BILL.

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:18.381
THIS BILL ALSO OFFENDS NOTIONS

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.416
OF EQUAL PROTECTION BY

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:20.817
BENEFITING WEALTHIER DEFENDANTS

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:22.152
WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:24.354
COST OF THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS.

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:25.889
THE BILL DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.724
KIND OF FUNDING STREAM TO PAY

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.159
THE CONSIDERABLE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DIVERSION

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:31.628
PROGRAM.

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:32.762
SO THOSE DEFENDANTS WITH THE

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.664
MEANS TO PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.966

HAVE CRIMES ARE RACED.

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.736
BUT OTHER DEFENDANTS WITHOUT

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.838
CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN WILL

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:42.839
HAVE ON THEIR RECORDS.

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:44.808
WELL NOT SPEAKING FOR LA COUNTY

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.309
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN LA

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:48.011
COUNTY ALONE THERE ARE ROUGHLY A

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.345
QUARTER MILLION MISDEMEANORS

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:50.814
FILED EACH YEAR.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.882
SB THREE NINETY FOUR WOULD ALLOW

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.250
MANY OF THESE DEFENDANTS PLUS A

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.186
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ELEVEN

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:58.021
SEVENTY H. FELONS TO MAKE A CASE

00:55:58.088 --> 00:56:00.256
FOR DIVERSION BASED SOLELY ON

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:01.558
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE CHILDREN.

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.959
LEAVING THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.295
CHILDREN NO OPPORTUNITY TO BE

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:06.730
DIVERTED FOR THE SAME CRIMES.

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:08.398
NOT ONLY IS THIS INEQUITABLE IT

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:10.133
IS GUARANTEED TO BOG DOWN THE

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.701
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.436
SINCE THIS IS A PRE PLEA PROGRAM

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.838
THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:17.607
ALL OF THESE CASES OPEN FOR UP

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:19.242
TO TWO YEARS WHILE THE DEFENDANT

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.944
PARTICIPATES IN THE PROGRAM.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.178
SAY HOWEVER THAT THE DEFENDANT

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:24.214
FAILS THE PROGRAM AFTER EIGHTEEN

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.015
MONTHS PROSECUTORS WOULD THEN BE

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.517
SCRAMBLING TO PUT TOGETHER A

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.319
CASE ON THE ORIGINAL CHARGES

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:30.620
WERE WITNESSES MAY LOOK NO

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:32.255
LONGER BE AVAILABLE OR MEMORIES

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:33.757
OF DEM.

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.825
SB THREE NINETY FOUR ALSO FAILS

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.327
TO EVEN CONSIDER THE VICTIMS OF

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:39.295
THESE CRIMES MANY OF WHOM WERE

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.463
ENTITLED TO RESTITUTION.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.732
HOW AND WHEN ILL RESTITUTION BE

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:43.700
PAID WHILE THE CASE IS BEING

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.335
DIVERTED?

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.836
CONSIDER TOO THAT SINCE A PERSON

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.171
WHO COMPLETES A PRETRIAL

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.973
DIVERSION PROGRAM WOULD HAVE THE

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.674
CRIME OR RAISED A FUTURE

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.643
EMPLOYER WILL NOT BE ALERTED TO

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.111
THE FACT THAT A NEW EMPLOYEE.

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.513
AND TRUSTED WITH HANDLING MONEY

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.548
OR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES

00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.517
MAY HAVE MULTIPLE ARRESTS FOR

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.051
FORGERY EMBEZZLEMENT OR OTHER

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:04.020
FINANCIAL CRIMES.

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.321
D. A.'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:07.724
ENTHUSIASTICALLY ESTABLISH MANY

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:08.291
DIVERSION PROGRAMS IN THEIR

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.193
COUNTIES FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.327
MENTAL HEALTH VETERANS AND

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:13.763
HOMELESSNESS JUST TO NAME A FEW.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.365
HOWEVER THIS BILL IF PASSED INTO

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.433
LAW WILL LIKELY NOT BE

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.568
IMPLEMENTED BY MANY D. A.'S A

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:21.037
FACT THAT SEEMS CURIOUSLY AT

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.272
ODDS WITH ITS INTENT.

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:23.573
THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE COURT

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.242
MAY SET UP THE FORMAL PRE TRIAL

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.211
DIVERSION PROGRAM OUTLINED HERE

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.280
WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DA

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:31.848
AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER.

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.783
IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A DA TO

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.285
PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATION OF

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:36.886
SUCH A PROGRAM AND NO SUCH

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:39.122
PROGRAM CAN BE CREATED WITH OUT

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.557
THE PARTICIPATION OF THE DA.

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:41.891
AND SINCE THE BILL ALLOWS A

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.827
JUDGE TO ENROLL A DEFENDANT IN

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.829
THE PROGRAM OVER THE AND JOB

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:47.564
OBJECTIONS OF THE DA.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.065
IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT MOST DA

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.400
SIMPLY WON'T CREATE THESE

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.435
PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:53.570
WISH TO BE FORCED TO DIVERT

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.038
DEFENDANTS THEY BELIEVE TO BE

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.706
UNDESERVING.

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:57.273

RAISED.

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.242

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:53.094
THE BILL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:54.829
FOR CDC ARE IF THERE IS A

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:59.401
SPECIFIC SECURITY CONCERN ABOUT

IT'S IF THAT'S WRITTEN INTO THE

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.840
BILL -- BUT I I THINK THAT THIS

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:08.309
IS NOT THIS IS NOT IS AN ISSUE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.044
THAT IS BEING ARTICULATED.

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.080
AND THERE'S I DON'T THINK ANY

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.915
SUBSTANCE TO IT -- AND SO --

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.250
WE'RE ALL CONCERNED WITH THE

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:18.486
SECURITY OF ALL OF OUR

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.255
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS.

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:21.389
BY THE VICTIMIZATION OF

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.824
HAPPENING.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.692
IS TRANSGENDER BEING PEOPLE

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:27.262
BEING VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF THE

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:28.897
WAY THAT WE ARE TREATING THEM

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.064

WE HEAR COMMENTS ALL THE TIME TO

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.205
MAKE IT CLEAR WHY WE NEED TO

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:38.306
PROTECT OUR TRANS COMMUNITIES

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:39.274
AND I THINK ESPECIALLY IN

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.775
PRISONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.010
VICTIMIZED.

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:42.544
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.845
PROTECTING THEM AND I APPRECIATE

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.113
THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY ON THE

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.381
PART OF CDC ARE SO IF THERE IS

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.248
SOMEONE.

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.950
AS DESCRIBED BY THE FIRST

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:53.188
OPPOSITION WITNESS WHO -- IS NOT

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.557
A FACTOR THAN THEY WANTED SO

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:55.857
THANK YOU.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.325
AND CRAP YEAH AND FOR THE IF YOU

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.326
WANT SOME OF THOSE STATISTICS

01:24:58.393 --> 01:24:59.494
ALSO -- ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:02.230
UC IRVINE 59% OF TRANS WOMEN

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:03.298
HELD IN MEN'S PRISONS WERE

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:06.034
SEXUALLY ABUSED COMPARED 24% OF

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.535
JUSTICE PEOPLE IN THE MEN'S

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.002
PRISONS.

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:09.537
AND THE NATIONALLY TRANS PEOPLE

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.539
ARE INCARCERATED ARE FIVE TO SIX

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:12.740
TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THE

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.008
GENERAL POPULATION TO BE

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.710
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY FACILITY

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.178
STAFF.

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.580
AND NINE TO TEN STE NINE TO TEN

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.014
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SEXUALLY

01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.583
ASSAULTED BY ANOTHER

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.084
INCARCERATED PERSON.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.653
AND SO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FOLKS

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.721
ARE GOING TO GO INTO WOMEN'S

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.389
PRISONS AND DO WHAT THEY ARE

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:29.724
DESCRIBING IS IS IS VERY

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.693
UNLIKELY AND I THINK THERE NEEDS

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:32.927
TO BE A MORE.

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.028
IN DEPTH LOOK AT HOW

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.330
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ACTUALLY

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:36.998
TREATING TRANSPORT A HOT

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:40.034
TRANSPORT TREATING PEOPLE IN

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:45.173
WATER INCARCERATED -- AND SO I

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.608
JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT AWESOME.

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:47.442
THANKS AGAIN IT HAPPENED ALMOST

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:47.976
IMMEDIATELY WHEN THAT WAS

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:48.977
IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:49.777
KINGDOM.

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:50.445
GENDER SELF ID AS SOON AS IT WAS

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:52.814
IMPLEMENTED THERE WERE SEXUAL

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:53.281
ASSAULTS.

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:54.816
THAT WERE DONE.

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.017
IMPLEMENT THAT WERE.

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:57.285
TRANSLATE INTO FIVE MALES DID

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.954
THAT TO WOMEN THAT IS WHY THEY

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:00.989
CREATED A SEPARATE.

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:01.956
UNIT.

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.691
IT HAPPENED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.926
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IS

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.728
THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:08.863
AND COME OVER.

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.332
TO MAKING HER -- BRINGING THIS

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:14.369
ARM I THINK RATHER IDEALISTIC

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:18.239
BILL -- TO THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:22.377
SOME QUESTIONS MYSELF I AM NOT.

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:23.745
A AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PHRASE

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.446
THIS APPROPRIATELY I DON'T KNOW

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.482
IF I'M AS CONCERNED BECAUSE I

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:28.950
BELIEVE THE STATISTICS THAT ARE

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.451
OUT THERE ABOUT TRANS REGARDLESS

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.387
OF YOUR INCARCERATED OR NOT OKAY

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.355
BEING TRAUMATIZED AND ASSAULTED.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:37.792
BUT I DO SORT OF QUESTION --

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.228
WHAT'S IN THE BILL WHAT KIND OF

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:40.795
LANGUAGES IN THE BILL THAT

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.931
REALLY TALKS TO THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:46.568
PURPORT TO BE TRANS -- WHO MAY

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:49.103
WANT TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO A

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.940
PARTICULAR FACILITY -- TO DO TO

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.108
CREATE ALL KIND OF MAYHEM -- SO

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.376
THAT'S ONE QUESTION THE OTHER

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.211
QUESTION I HAVE IS I WOULD JUST

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:59.013
LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR AND

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.014
THE EXPERTS.

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:03.217
ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE PRISON

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.286
SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:06.821
THIS I THINK IT'S MUCH BROADER

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.023
THAN A PRONOUN I THINK WHAT YOU

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.358
SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU KNOW

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.093
THIS IS NOT GOING TO FIX IT BUT

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:12.627
HOPEFULLY IT WILL START A

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:13.861
DIALOGUE.

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:17.198
IS INCREDIBLY ACUTELY ACCURATE --

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:20.401
BUT I JUST AM CURIOUS ABOUT YOU

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:20.969
KNOW THAT.

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:22.070
BECAUSE WE REALLY SHOULD BE

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:22.904
TALKING ABOUT HOW TO HAVE A

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.106
CULTURE CHANGE WITHIN THE PRISON

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:26.074
SYSTEM.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.375
YOU KNOW THERE ARE TRANS FOLKS

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:28.876
WERE BEING ASSAULTED AND

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.878
MOLESTED AND RAPED BUT THEY'RE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.748
ALSO SAYS WOMEN -- AND MEN WHO

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:34.949
ARE BEING YOU KNOW.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:38.953
ASSAULTED AND RAPED AND THEN

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.954
BASED ON YOUR ETHNICITY.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.089
YOU HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE FOLKS

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.657
ARE BEING TARGETED IF THEY'RE

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.158
NOT FROM THE SAME GANG IF

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:45.727
THEY'RE FROM A DIFFERENT GANG IF

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.228
THEY'RE A DIFFERENT RACE OR IF

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.429
THEY'RE DIFFERENT ETHNICITY OR A

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:49.864
DIFFERENT RELIGION.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:50.832
I MEAN ALL OF THIS KIND OF

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:53.034
TRAUMA IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW IN

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.470
THESE -- PRISON SYSTEMS AND I

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:56.771
CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT CDC

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.507
ARE HAS THE CAPACITY TO EVEN

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:00.642
MANAGES ACTS.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.510
SO I JUST WONDER BECAUSE YOU

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.444
TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE'S

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:05.146
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT TALKS

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.914
ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT CDC

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:08.082
OUR HOUSE IF YOU CAN KIND OF

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.717
SPEAK TO THE BROADER ISSUE

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:13.121
BECAUSE MY FEAR IS THAT WE THEN

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.589
HAVE THIS HAPPEN.

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.357
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET MORE

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:18.292
STATS ARE REPORTS ABOUT MORE

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:21.029
TRANS FOLKS BEING HURT BECAUSE

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:23.064
WE'VE SORT OF CHANGED A SYSTEM

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.265
THAT REALLY ISN'T.

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.933
PREPARED AND THEN SAID OKAY

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.468
LET'S CREATE THE IDEAL IN THE

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.403
REAL.

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.605
AND THEN WE HAVE MORE CHAOS

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.373
BECAUSE THAT'S I MEAN YOU KNOW

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.808
DOING THAT I THINK IS EQUAL TO

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.343
ACTUALLY DOING NOTHING AND

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.512
SAYING YOU KNOW SCREW YOU YOU'RE

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.380
INCARCERATED DEAL WITH IT.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:41.282
YEAH AND JUST SO IN IN CRAFTING

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.784
THIS AND OBVIOUSLY WE ARE

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.886
WORKING CLOSELY WITH A A BROAD

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:48.556
COALITION -- BY INCLUDING WITH.

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:50.525
TRANS PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:51.559
INCARCERATED OR WERE

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.728
INCARCERATED WHO UNDERSTAND ON

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:54.929
THE GROUND.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.698
WHAT IS GOING TO PROTECT THEIR

01:28:56.764 --> 01:28:58.466
SAFETY SO IT DOT?

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.568
WHAT HOWARD PRACTICE WAS NOT

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.136
DONE IN A IN A VACUUM?

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.404
I AND AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:06.074
ALSO CREATES FLEXIBILITY -- THAT

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.242
A TRANS PERSONS OWN SENSE OF

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:13.548
SAFETY AND HEALTH IS.

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:16.451
IS FACTORED IN -- CDC ARE -- WE

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.419
HAVE BEEN REGULARLY MEETING WITH

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:21.022
CDC ARE -- STARTING BEFORE WE

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:21.656
INTRODUCE THIS BILL SIGNED LAST

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:24.325
YEAR I NCDC ARW I GOT I DON'T I

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.259
DON'T SPEAK FOR CC I DON'T WANT

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:25.793
TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT THEY

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.427
REPORT TO US THAT THEY WANT TO

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:27.361
MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION IN FACT

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:28.830
THEY HAVE A WORKING GROUP.

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:31.265
INTERNALLY ON TO MOVE IN THIS

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:34.102
DIRECTION -- AND SO I DON'T

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.536
THINK WE'RE ENCOUNTERING A

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:37.405
AGENCY THAT IS SAYING NO WE

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.607
CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:40.842
THEY WANT TO GET THEIR ON'T.

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.643
CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.312
PROBLEMS IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.114
AROUND VIOLENCE AND MANY MANY

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.381
OTHER ISSUES.

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.350
AND I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:51.319
AND SAY SB ONE THIRTY TWO IS

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:52.420
GOING TO LIE TO MAGICALLY FIX AT

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:54.889
ALL STILL GONNA TAKE A LOT OF

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:56.157
WORK WITH THIS IS.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:30:00.228
ONE STOP -- FOR ONE INMATE

01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.230
POPULATION THAT HAS A LOT OF

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:04.298
CHALLENGES AND SO I THINK THAT

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.633
THIS WILL NOT SOLVE EVERYTHING

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.935
BUT MOVE US IN A GOOD DIRECTION

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:10.204
I DON'T KNOW IF -- IF MACHE OR

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.340
NOT YEAH YEAH AND AGAIN LIKE I

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.207
SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IT ISN'T

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:14.375
GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING AND I

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.444
THINK IT'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:17.912
TO CREATE DIALOGUE AROUND.

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.814
WHO TRANS PEOPLE ARE AND LIKE

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.715
THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THEY

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:21.883
FACE ALL INCARCERATED WHICH IS

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.117
VERY RECENT THAT'S COME UP TO

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:24.519
THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK WHAT

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:25.353
MAKES?

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.621
OUR WORK ON THIS BILL SO

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:28.222
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'RE DOING ON

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.657
THE GROUND DIRECT SUPPORT TO

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:31.159
INCARCERATED PEOPLE WORKING

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.760
DIRECTLY WITH CDC ARE AND THEN

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:33.961
TRYING TO PUSH FOR STATEWIDE

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:35.029
LEGISLATION AND SO.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.330
ALL THREE OF THOSE MERGING

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:39.634
FACTORS I THINK ARE CRAFTING --

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:42.236
A PROCESS AND CRAFTING QUICK

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:43.704
SORT OF A SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.740
HELP INCARCERATED TRANS FOLKS IF

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:52.780
THIS BILL WERE TO BE PASSED AND

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.482
SO IT'S I THINK THE REALLY

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:55.683
TRANSPARENT AND HONEST

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.084
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING CCDC

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:58.252
ARE ARE HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:58.953
AND LIKE DETERMINING.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.121
HOW WE WOULD SCREEN PEOPLE FROM?

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:01.022
FROM BECAUSE LIKE FOR PREDATORY

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:04.826
PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO WOMEN'S

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:06.527
UNLIKELY IT COULD BE A

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:08.062
POSSIBILITY AND WE ARE TAKING

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.697
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND SO I

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.699
THINK -- WE ARE HAVING ONGOING

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.768
DIALOGUE AND I CAN'T STRESS THAT

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.503
ENOUGH BECAUSE I THINK THAT --

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.572
WERE REALLY REALLY TRYING TO BE

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.440
INTENTIONAL WITH THIS BILL.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.908
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.877
COMMENTS YOU KNOW I GONNA JUST

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:24.912
ADD THAT YOU KNOW I'M SKEPTICAL

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.414
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN THE

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.816
WAY OF TRYING AND YOU WON'T KNOW

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.251
UNTIL YOU TRY.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.186

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:42.129
CURIOUS BECAUSE PULLING UP THE

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:45.766
OPPOSITION STUFF WITHOUT THE

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.535
SOLUTION THAT THEY DID IN.

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.403
THE U. K..

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.805
THEY ENDED UP DOING A SEPARATE

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:53.507
FACILITY FOR TRANS GENDERED.

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:55.676
AND MY QUESTION SENATORS HOW

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:58.212
COME WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT DOING

01:31:58.279 --> 01:31:59.981
THAT -- YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:02.383
RUNNING THIS LEGISLATION RUN

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:04.452
SOMETHING TO SET UP ME EITHER

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:05.586
SEPARATE BLOCK.

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:08.489
OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:11.058
TO HAVE A SEPARATE.

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:12.393

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.160
THEY'RE GOING TO PRISON THEIR

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:15.496
GOING TO PRISON CELL.

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:16.597
DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT DOING LIKE

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:17.932
A SEVER PRESENT FOR TRANS GENDER

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.002
NEEDS IN FACILITIES AND

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:21.669

THEY NEED.

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:23.371
AND THAT THOSE CORRECTIONAL

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:24.672
GUARDS THERE HAVE SPECIAL

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.540
TRAINING TO ENSURE THEY KNOW HOW

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.009
TO TREAT PEOPLE.

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:29.277
I MEAN THEY SHOULD BE TREATING

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.845
PEOPLE RIGHT ANYWAY BUT JUST TO

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:33.514

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:44.825
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT OKAY THIS

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:46.327
IS HOW THEY SOLVED IT.

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.663
AND NOW THINGS ARE BETTER THERE

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:49.997
WHY WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.766
LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.801
COUNTRIES LIKE WE DO WITH A LOT

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:54.535
OF OTHER THINGS.

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:57.705
BECAUSE TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:01.642

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:16.524
AS A WOMAN AND BY I UNDERSTAND

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:17.625
THAT'S THAT YOUR FEELINGS ON A

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.459
WERE TALKING ABOUT PRISON

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.628
POPULATIONS AND SUB CULTURES

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:22.396
THAT ALL HAVE THEIR OWN VERY.

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:23.931

SO I MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:40.181

AMONG OTHER THINGS -- WHICH

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:16.784
LEADS TO INCREASED VIOLENCE

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:19.020
AGAINST SOME AND OTHER PROBLEMS

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.788

BROADER AND OTHER ISSUES THAT

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.962
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE

PRISON SYSTEM.

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.165

SEPARATE FACILITY FOR THEIR

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.747
STIGMATIZES FURTHER MARGINALIZES

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:49.517
