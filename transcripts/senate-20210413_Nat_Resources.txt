I'M SORRY WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY. WE'RE DONE PERFECT BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT AT FIFTEEN MINUTES- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK- BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THAT COMPLETES THE- OPPOSITION TWO PEOPLE HAVE- QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR M. MR ONE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE- THIS COMMENTS- IN OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE 70% OF THE OIL PRODUCED IN THE STATE IS PRODUCED IN MY COUNTY- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THE A DOLLAR VALUE- YOU KNOW THERE'S THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE SENSE I BELIEVE THIS OR FROM THE BAND WILL FIND ANOTHER STE- THERE WAS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE WAS TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS SWEPT OUT INTO THE- AND- I BELIEVE THE GENERAL FUND. IF THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING USED BY CAL JIM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS BASED ON YOUR PREVIOUS BILL LAST YEAR AND OTHER BILLS. IN THE RESOURCES ARE IN THESE FUNDS HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT BEING USED IN THEIR BEING SWEPT OUT TO BE FUNDING AT OTHER PARTS OF GOVERNMENT- I GUESS I WANT TO SAY DON'T YOU THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THAT WE INCREASE THE FEES EVEN THOUGH THE FEES ARE ALREADY- NOT BEING USED. ALREADY- BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE I JUST DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO ASK IT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. IF THE FUNDS ARE BEING SWEPT FROM THIS- THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SWEPT FROM THESE THIS FUND. FOR OTHER USES AND YOUR BILL IS TO INCREASE THE SPEND SO MONEY CAN BE USED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF CAL JAM. THE CALCIUM IS EASING THE FENCE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT WHY IS THERE A PURPOSE FOR YOUR BILL. IF THE MONEY'S BEING USED- NOT BEING USED ALREADY AND IT'S BEEN SWEPT TO ANOTHER. PART OF GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND I DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY. POINTS TO THE ANALYSIS ON BOTH PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS AND ALSO ASK THREE. OF THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS TEACH NINETEEN AT THE IDYLLWILD REPORTS TALKS ABOUT HOW TO FIND IT- EXIST AND I THINK THAT THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE. HAVE BEEN MADE THAT THE- I'M MONEY HAS NOT BEEN. A WIDELY USED COMPLETELY. IS ACTUALLY NOT THE FULL PICTURE AND THE ANALYSIS GOES INTO THE DETAILS- CAL CHEN HAS TO. GATHER THE MONEY AND THEN BE ABLE TO WORK ON THE PROJECT AND SO THEY HAVESPENT UP TO THREE MILLION THEY CANNOT SPEND OVER AND SO IT HAS BEEN A VERY DELICATE MATCH OF FINDING THE RIGHT PROJECT. TO BE ABLE TO DO AND SO AGAIN IF FROM THE ANALYSIS WE WILL SEE THAT TO- THE PICTURE THAT'S BEEN PAINTED THAT THE FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED APPROPRIATELY- IT IS NOT THE FULL PICTURE- THERE IS ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. EVEN WITH EXISTING EFFORTS AS POINTS OUT IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS YOU REFERENCE MY BILL IN THE PAST IS STILL NOT ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE A RANGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PLUS MILLION DOLLARS TO FIVE POINT TWO MILLION THAT'S ESTIMATED. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PLUG AND ABANDON THE CURRENT WELLS AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT EVEN CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FUTURE WELLS. THAT COULD BE ABANDONED AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED- AND- I DON'T AGREE THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW. RIGHT NOT APPROPRIATE TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THAT IT'S NEEDED I THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS- HIGHLIGHTS THAT AND CLARIFIES- TO THE OPPOSITION- THAT THE FUNDING REALLY IS BEING. USED- IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. SO ARE YOU SEE NOAM WAS FROM THIS ACCOUNT TO GO TO OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ITS SPEAK ON THE MANY SLACKS STUDY I AM NOT I AM NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO I CAN'T. SPEAK TO THAT AND I WILL SEE IF. THE COMMITTEE STAFF CAN SPEAK TO THE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. OKAY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THREE MILLION IN THE SPECIAL FUNDS RIGHT SO I GUESS BUT YOUR BILL WANTS TO INCREASE THOSE DOLLARS. AND A THREE MILLION TO THE SPECIAL FUND CORRECT THE THREE MILLION TO THE SPECIAL FINE. BUT MANY HAS BEEN SWEPT FROM THIS FUND INTO OTHER AREAS OF GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW I GUESS WE CAN GET IT. I DON'T HAVE LIKE A BALANCE SHEET THAT SHOWS MANY IN AND OUT BUT- MONEY FROM THIS FUND THAT YOU WANT TO INCREASE WASN'T USED IN WAS HE AND THEN WAS SWEPT TO ANOTHER PART OF GOVERNMENT FOR. ANOTHER USE- I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE. I DON'T SEE MORE PRODUCTIVE I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT IS IN THIS FUND IS USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE FUND WHICH IS TO ADDRESS THE ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS- AND IF MONEY'S BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SEVEN WHICH IT APPEARS THAT IT IS- WE DON'T NEED MORE LEGISLATION TO INCREASE MONEY TO GO BACK INTO THIS FUND WE NEED MANY TO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE MONEY IN THIS FUND IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FUND IF THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I WILL SAY THAT I THINK. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE IDENTIFYING TWO DIFFERENT ITEMS ONE. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY. IS NEEDED TO ACTUALLY. SECURE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM RIGHT OF THE ABANDONED WELLS- THE BUT YOU'RE ALSO SPEAKING TO- DAY. THAT HE LEFT. FUNDS SO THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT FUNDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO THE THREE MILLION SPECIAL SIGN IS NOT THAT. HE WAS FUNDS THAT'S H. E. W. A S. I CAN'T RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FUND THAT I'M DEALING WITH. THEY ARE SEPARATE SIGNS. THAT YOU'RE LEADING TO AND CERTAINLY- I ACTUALLY SHARE. YOUR OPINION THAT- MONEY FOR ABANDONED UP AND PLUG WHAT ABOUT FOR BILL- BATTING IN AND PLUGGING WELLS. SHOULD BE USED FOR THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY THAT THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WAS SWEPT. INTO IS NOT THIS TIME. IT'S. THE- HE'D WHAT FUNDS. A BUT ALL THESE FUNDS ARE CONTROLLED BY CAL JIM RATE OR NOT. SO I ME BUT I CAN'T SO AGAIN I CAN'T SPEAK TO A DIFFERENT FUND AND BUILD THIS BILL DOES NOT. LEAD TO AN END SO THAT IT YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT WORKER DIFFERENT BILL. FOR A DIFFERENT FIND I'M I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I SHARE THE OPINION THAT. FUNDS SHOULD BE USED FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE THANK YOU MA'AM. FROM SENATOR LIMóN- CENTER GROVE SAID SHE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO ASK THE QUESTION ANOTHER WAY. AND I THINK I DO WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION ANOTHER WAY. BECAUSE THE- WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY AND OVERSAW THAN DARKER. WE HAD THIS INCREDIBLE FOR FUN WHILE PROBLEM WHO WHERE IT WAS SOMETHING TO LOSE SLEEP OVER THAT THERE WERE THESE ORPHAN WELLS COMING WHERE THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WAS IN RESERVE FOR ANYWHERE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DO IT AND IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A HUGE COST DUMPED BURKE UNDER THE TAXPAYERS SO THE QUESTION IS. DO YOU HAVE SOME SENSE. OF COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM WHAT GOES INTO THESE FUNDS OR WHAT BILLS THE BILLS SAY SOME SENSE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST IS FOR MORE FOR ORPHAN WELLS THAT EXIST OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. YES CHAIR AND ACTUALLY THAT REALLY DOES RANGE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON THE CURRENT WELLS AND THIS IS FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN IDYLLWILD REPORT- SO THIS IS A CALCULATION SO THIS IS WHY. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REMEDY THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT THE TAXPAYERS TO BIRD AND ALL OF THAT- THE COST IT IS A VERY BIG COSTS SO IF. YOU JUST LOOKING AT THE WELLS OUT THERE- EATS A BIG RANGE- AND CERTAINLY AT ONE MILLION WHICH IS WHAT THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT WAS AND AS THE FIND- IT WOULD TAKE US OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I TO BE ABLE TO DO THE MINIMAL WORK- BUT WE REALLY WON'T KNOW UNTIL THE WORK. YOU KNOW IT IS STARTED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AT IMPORTANT WORK YOU KNOW FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND SO IT'S REGRETTABLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NINE PINYIN THAT INCREASING THE FINE WOULD CREATE MORE YOU KNOW JOBS- BUT IT CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT- WE WANT THIS WORKED AND WE WANT. TO BE ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO. FOR THE CLEANUP OF THIS- YOU KNOW OF THESE AND THIS BIG PROBLEM HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY INDUSTRY IT IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT THAT I THINK THAT IS A COMMON DENOMINATOR WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A PROBLEM- AND THESE ARE REALLY BIG FUNDS WERE LOOKING AT SO WE CERTAINLY WANT TO FIND A WAY. TO SOLVE NOW AND THEN THERE. THE POINT ABOUT SWEEPING MONEY FROM ANY FUND MAKES NO SENSE IT IT'S LIKE WHY WOULD YOU SWEEP MONEY FROM THE FUND. IF IT'S BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND SOME BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OBLIGATION THAT EXISTS OUT THERE HE IS YOUR BILL ADDRESSING THE MAXIMUM THAT WOULD PREVENT. THE SWEEPING. OF FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. TELL MY BILL ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE OF. ANY DOES SPECIFY THAT IT WOULD BE FOR IT PLUGGING AND ABANDONING WELLS. AND SO IF THERE WAS INTEREST IN IT. DOUBLE OR PROCESS TO FIND OUT I WOULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO DO THAT I MEAN THAT READ THIS IS VERY VERY SPECIFIC- FOR THIS EFFORT. AND WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY INSTANCE WHERE ANY FUNDS HAVE BEEN SWEPT FROM THIS FIND THAT WE'RE WORKING ON- AND- I THINK THAT THERE IS. ALSO A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW ALL. BECAUSE THIS FUND WILL NEVER AT LEAST IN THIS ITERATION OF THE OF THE BILL WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. FOR THE ENTIRE PROBLEM BUT IT WILL BE BETTER ADDRESS THE PROBLEM- I A THINK THAT THERE IS THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND THE VALUE OF LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO PAY FOR IT. THE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. IF THERE IS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM AFTER- AND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TAXPAYERS TO PAY THAT- END WE WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE JOBS THAT REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA- TOWARD DEALING WITH ORPHAN WELLS. IF THERE'S ANY PART OF YOUR BILL THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES CLEARLY IF THIS BILL MOVES TODAY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT GETS ADDRESSED CORRECTLY. ABSOLUTELY OKAY BIGGER BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AT THE COMMITTEE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE THE END AT THE END WE SHOULD- RICHEST ARE NOTE THE MANY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED TO TRY TO WORK DID YOU WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED AGAINST CENTER GROVE CITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO AGREE WITH YOU MISS SOLOMON THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS AND- YOU KNOW BY A CONTRACTOR THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS CONTACTING ME REGARDING CAL JAM BECAUSE THEY WERE ABANDONED IN A HUNDRED YEAR OLD WELL SOMEPLACE DOWN IN NEWPORT BEACH- LONG BEACH OR- SOMETHING LIKE THAT. M. SO I DO AGREE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT THERE AT. I DON'T I DO AND I DO NOT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE RESOURCES IN THERE TO ADDRESS- THE ABANDONED OR FROM WELL FIND ISSUE- AGAIN REPRESENTING 70% OF THE OIL THAT'S PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I GET BEAT I GET I THINK I HAVE A GREAT AT GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDUSTRY NOT AN EXPERT UNDERSTANDING BUT A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDUSTRY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT'S LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION- NOT. ONE DIME HAS EVER BEEN PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS TO ADDRESS- ORPHANED OR ABANDONED WELLS. IT'S ALL 1100% INDUSTRY FUNDED. AND IF THIS FEE GOES FORWARD INDUSTRY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR AND THIS IT WAS FOR THIS FUND IT WOULD NOT GO ON TAXPAYERS SHOULDERS. M. THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE IS WHETHER IT'S TEN MILLION FIFTY MILLION FIVE MILLION THREE MILLION THE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE FUNDS THEIR USE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE TO ADDRESS THE ORPHAN AND WENT ABANDONED WELL ISSUE THAT WE ALL EVERYONE INCLUDING INDUSTRY AS A CONCERN WITH THAT MANY IS NEVERTHELESS STILL BEING SWEPT OUT OF THESE ACCOUNTS IN INTO OTHER SOURCES OF OUR OTHER REASONS TO SPEND MANY IN GOVERNMENT. SO THAT I HAVE I DO HAVE THAT CONCERN I ALSO- I DON'T KNOW IF COMMITTEE STAFF CAN ANSWER THIS AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T POINT THIS QUESTION AT YOU MISS LIMóN BECAUSE I DON'T I MEAN YOU'RE BRILLIANT AND I'M SURE YOU MIGHT HAVE THE ANSWER BUT IF YOU DON'T- COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF CAN ANSWER IT. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE WELLS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOP THREE PRODUCERS IN THE STATE. I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER- BUT CERTAINLY I'VE COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE IT WE'D BE HAPPY TO GET YOU THAT ANSWER. BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL. ANYWAYS THANK YOU MISS SOMEONE FOR LETTING ME ASK THESE QUESTIONS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. AND I THINK I'M GOING TO ADD TO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING THAT KEEPS GETTING SAID BUT I DON'T THINK THE TO KEEP SAYING THIS THE FUNDS WERE SWEPT IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING WAS A LOAN THAT WOULD BE PAID BACK TO THE PHONE TO SET DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. SENATOR LAMONT YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A LOAN IT WASN'T JUST SWEPT IT WAS A LOAN THAT FINANCED A GRUNT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I'M SORRY IT YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT FUND THAT'S BEING REFERENCED OKAY. THEN WE'RE GOOD IT'S JUST MY EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST IS THAT WAS ALONE THIS BUT MISTER CHAIR THE POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS ON ESTIMATES ONLY AND WE'RE TAKING MONEY. FROM A SOLELY INDUSTRY PROVIDED FUND NOT TAX FOR ITS ITS SOLELY INDUSTRY FUNDED. AND WE'RE TAKING THE INDUSTRY CONSISTS MANY THESE FRIENDS RATHER IT'S THE ABANDONED OR FROM A FINE OR THAT THE OTHER FIND THEIR USE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND THEY TAKE THAT MONEY FROM THOSE FANS THEY'VE SWEEP IT LOAN AT WHATEVER. WINS LAST TIME ALONE IS BEEN PAID BACK YOU KNOW HELLO MOORLACH SORRY I WAS BUDGET CHAIR. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WE DID. OF LOANS AND THEN JERRY BROWN PAID THE MALL BACK. SO DO. SO BUT I THINK. I THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT IF IT'S A LONE ENDED AND IT'S SORT ARE WILL STIPULATE THAT THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT MAKES ME CRAZY OF A BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE WORK. AWARENESS OF HOW IT MIGHT POLITICALLY UP BECAUSE THIS IS PAID FOR BY THE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REGULATED AND SHOULD GO FOR THE STATED PURPOSE PERIOD THE END TEN IT IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THE SECOND THING. IS THAT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS ANY UPDATED INFORMATION BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH THE SUBJECT PART OF THE EXASPERATION IS THE STATE AGENCY WAS TAKING FOREVER TO PROCESS THE ORPHAN WELLS IN THAT YEAR THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF ORPHAN WELLS OUT THERE BUT DEALING WITH IT AND I THINK THERE'S EVEN A BUDGET REQUEST THIS YEAR TO TRY TO GIVE THEM THE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THEY MOVED TO. THE FOREFRONT WHILE CENTER FOR CERTIFICATION UP MORE SENATOR LAMONT YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. SORRY EIGHT. WHAT DO I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT PART OF WHAT YOU SAID BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S OF A BUDGET ASK OR SOMETHING OUT THERE TO GET THEM TO PROCESS THE ORPHAN WELLS QUICKER. WELL I MEAN IS THAT THE BILL THAT WE CARRIED IT IN THE PAST WAS IT AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF CAL JAM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS IT- FASTER. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT OF ONE THIS YEAR- THEN THAT MAN. NO MORE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WE'RE NOT OF THE SEPT OF FINAL ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE LET ME MAKE A COMMENT- WE HAVE A LOT. THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN FRONT OF US THERE'S STRONG OPPOSITION FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY CONCERNED. ABOUT JOBS. THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER FOR FRIEND WELLS ARE BEING PROCESS QUICK ENOUGH. THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER FINANCES THING IS A LOAN RATHER THAN- PER PER COMPLETE SWEEP THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT MONEY WILL COME BACK. AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD INFLUENCE THIS AND THE AUTHOR HAS SAID. SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK ON THESE I FOR ONE WOULD BE WILLING. TO GIVE THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO MOVE THIS ALONG AND WORK ON IT BUT I THINK THAT. FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE THOSE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IT IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMPLEMENT SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU SEEKING TO BE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU SIR YES YES. GO AHEAD. YES I JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT YOUR OBSERVATIONS THERE WITH RESPECT TO THESE OPEN ISSUES AND SUPPORT BUT- OBVIOUSLY THESE THINGS NEED TO BE RESOLVED SO I JUST WANT. TO STAND SUPPORTERS STATE AFTER. AND THE OTHER THING SHOULD JUST FOR AS MUCH. IT'S ALL NEVER THE TIME I WAS MAYOR. AND WE HAD TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SITTING IN THE ROOM WAITING FOR AN ITEM. AND WE HAD AN ITEM WITH TWO PEOPLE IN THE ROOM ABOUT THE HOTEL HEIGHT. AND I THOUGHT I'D TAKE IT QUICKLY TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY ON ALL TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THE HOTEL SIDE BECAUSE I HAD ME SIT THERE WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT AND I THINK WE ARE. HAVING THAT DYNAMIC HERE EVERYBODY'S WAITING FOR THE FRACKING BILL AND THEY'RE WEIGHING IN ON ON THIS. SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE SENATOR WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU CARE AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT CONVERSATION AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO. THERE IS DIFFERENT FORMS OF OPPOSITION ONE NOT RELATED TO THE BILL- BUT TO A DIFFERENT BILL THAT'S COMING FORWARD BUT ALSO TO THE CONCERNS FROM- ARE YOU KNOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN LABOR AYE. EXTINCT AYE IHOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME AND VALUE IN AND ANALYZING THE BILL AND LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT. INCREASING THE FUNDS- CREATES MORE JOBS AND OR YOU KNOW THAT THE WORK NEEDS TO GET DONE IN AND ABANDONING END UP LIKING WELLS APPROPRIATELY. I THINK TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FINE I JUST ASK FOR- A SEPARATION OF THE TO FIND THE WE ARE IN THIS BILLS. YOU KNOW WHAT EALS WITH ONE OF FIND NOT THE FUND THAT'S BEING REFERENCED. AND I THINK THAT THE THIRD POINT- ABOUT CLARIFYING. THAT THESE THAT FUNDS SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF THE BANNING AND ABANDONING END UP LIKING. AND PLUGGING WELLS APPROPRIATELY IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS GENERAL CONSENSUS WITH AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. ENSURE THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE CLARIFY THAT AND STRENGTH IN THAT PIECE IN THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE MOTION ON THIS BILL. SAN HERTZBERG. TO THE WHAT DO. CALL THE ROLL.

WITH YOU TODAY I'LL BE BRIEF- YOU YOU'VE OUCHED ON SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES ALREADY THAT ARE GOING. THAT THEY'RE TAKING PLACE A CALLA JIM. LESS SO- IN ISSUE A- IT INDUSTRY VERSUS ENVIRONMENT OR CONCERNS FOR BETWEEN YOU KNOW LABOR AND FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES WE'RE GONNA HEAR A LOT OF THOSE ARGUMENTS PLAY OUT TODAY BUT THIS BILL. IS IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT LANE IN THAT IT'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO INSTITUTE. A REGULATORY COMPETENCIES SO THAT. WHEN WE PASS LAWS THAT THE AGENCIES ACTUALLY HAVE THE IMPRIMATUR AND THE PUSH TO DO IT. A DOZEN OBVIOUSLY DOING SOME OF THE BUDGET ISSUES OUT THERE BUT WE'VE HAD ONGOING ISSUES IN TERMS OF- TRACKING WELL HISTORY'S DISCLOSURE AROUND SITES- UPDATES TO WEBSITES TRYING TO EXPEDITE ADA COMPLIANCE FOR DOCUMENT REQUESTS A LOT OF THE INDUSTRY STILL ON PAPER AND SO THINGS ARE HAVING TO GET. SCANNED AND ENTERED BY HAND IN THEIRS BACKLOGS IN FRUSTRATION AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WHEN ZONING ADMINISTRATORS LIKE IN MY BACKYARD ACTUALLY WERE MY OWN FAMILY LIVES THERE'S A WELL SITE LITERALLY BEHIND- MY FATHER IN LAW'S OLD APARTMENT AND- WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH. ZONING ADMINISTRATOR THERE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND TRYING TO GET RECORDS DISCLOSED- AND CAL JIM AND THE CITY. DON'T SIMPLY HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S ODD- BUT THAT'S THE CIRCUMSTANCE RIGHT NOW AND SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE THINGS THIS BILLS TRYING TO SOLVE- I CAN GET INTO A FEW MORE DETAILS BUT- THINGS LIKE WELL EXPIRATION DATES. NOTICES OF VIOLATION- THOSE KIND OF ISSUES AND WILL HISTORY I THINK BY GETTING ALL THAT CLEAR IN THE LAW. AND HOPEFULLY HAVING. A RENEWAL PLAN THAT I THINK THE AGENCY IS COMMITTED TO BRINGING AND SECRETARY CROWFOOT WAS GOING TO BE TESTIFYING HERE THIS MORNING. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT- THEY SHOULD BE COMING BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE WAS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL SO WE WANT THIS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND TRY TO SET. A NEW CHAPTER IN THIS THIS NEW DIVISION OVER IT AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY WOULD SO WITH THAT. I WILL I WILL CUT MY REMARKS AND- ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I THINK WE HAVE.

OKAY MY NAME IS MICHAEL SALMAN I'M A RECENTLYRETIRED PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT UCLA. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN I'VE BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN UNPAID CITIZEN ADVOCACY ABOUT OIL REGULATION. AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THE SOUTH COAST AQ MD AND THE STATE. READY ACCESS TO THE OIL WELL RECORDS THAT WOULD BE MANDATED BY S. BEFORE A SIX IS CRITICAL TO THE PUBLIC. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO LOCAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE OF SEQUIN COOPER DUTIES THAT ARE MANDATED BY STATE LAW. THIS THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE WORLD RECORDS READILY AVAILABLE ACCESS BY THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL AGENCIES IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR CAL JIM TO PERFORM ITS DUTIES PROPERLY. I'LL ILLUSTRATE THIS WITH TWO EXAMPLES FROM LARGE OIL DRILL SITES IN LA CITY DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST AND- SENATOR STERN AND HIS SPEND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. HAVE A COPY OF THIS WRITTEN TESTIMONY UPON CUT SHORT. THE WEST PICO DUAL SIDED IN THE LARGELY WHITE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE ROBERTSON NEIGHBORHOOD AS FIFTY SEVEN WELLS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE OPERATING COMPANY DRILL TWO NEW WELLS TWELVE THREE DRILLS INTO TEN WELL CONVERSIONS WITH DOCTOR PERMITS. ALL OF THESE PROJECTS REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL BY CITY PLANNING AND SECRET CLEARANCE BUT NO APPLICATIONS WERE MADE AND THE CITY DOES NO COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS TO CHECK FOR UNAPPROVED PROJECTS. WITH THE OPERATOR APPLIED FOR THE DOCTOR PROPER PERMITS THE CHECK BOXES STATING THAT NO LOCAL AGENCY SEQUEL CLEARANCE WAS REQUIRED. I WAS ABLE TO TRACK THESE TWENTY FOUR ON APPROVED PROJECTS ONLY BECAUSE THE DOG- WELL RECORDS DATA FROM BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AFTER APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN DOGRA STOPPED UPDATING ONLINE FILES AND I READ ALL THE FILES BEFORE CAL JIM DISCONNECTED IT'S FTP SERVER IN SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY. THE BANNING DRILL SITE IN THE LARGELY LATINO WORKING CLASS WILMINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD HAS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WELLS. THIS IS THE NEW ASTRAL SIGHT IN THE CITY OPENED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WITH CITY APPROVAL TO DRILL FIVE HUNDRED FORTY WELLS OVER A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD ENDING IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AFTER THE EXPIRATION THE SITE OPERATOR REPLIED TO DOCTOR FOR ABOUT A HALF DOZEN PERMITS TO DRILL NEW WELLS. USING WELL STAR THE OPERATORS SUBMITTED THE EXPO TO. SIX CITY PA APPROVED. AND MITIGATED NEGATIVE. THE OPERATOR RECEIVED DOCTOR PERMITS THE OPERATOR ALSO APPLIED FOR TO REACH ALL PERMITS AND PRESENTED THE TWO THOUSAND SIX APPROVAL WHICH NEVER AUTHORIZED. REDRAWING AND THEIR APPLICATION. SALMON IF YOU. COULD SEE PLEASE WRAP PLEASE WRAP IT BUT IT IS UNCLEAR APPLICATIONS THE OPERATOR LISTED AS LOCAL AGENCY CONTACT. A PLANNING STAFFERS LAST WORK FOR THE CITY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. NEITHER LOCAL AGENCIES NOR CAL JIM CAN DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY WITH A PUBLIC ACCESS TO CRITICAL RECORDS OF OIL WELLS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MATTERS BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE AUTHOR. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SOLUTION I UNDERSTAND I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE- THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO HAVE. AT THEIR FINGERTIPS I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN IS IN. IN BELIEVE ME I HAVE MY OWN ISSUES WITH CAL JIM SO I'M NOT HERE TRYING TO DEFEND CAL JIM. AN BUT YOU KNOW EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT ANY OWNER OR- ANY OWNER OF ANY WILL FILE. A WITH CAL JIM THE SUPERVISOR MEANING- SPECIFICALLY THE SUPERVISOR OF CAL JAM. A MONTHLY STATEMENT TO PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO THE WELL INCLUDING THE SOURCE THE VOLUME THE TREATMENT THE DISPOSITION OF THE WATER PRODUCED IN THE OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES THE OWNER OF ANY WILL TO FILE WITH THE SUPERVISOR AGAIN CALCIUM. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS SPECIFIED INFORMATION RELATED TO- THE WILL. OF THE SPECIFIED INFORMATION AND IF THERE'S A LIST THAT COULD GO ON AN EXISTING ALSO REQUIRES THE OPERATOR. AT THAT PRODUCES OIL BY THE APPLICATION OF THE MINING IN- AB. APPLICATION MINING OR OTHER UNCONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE TO BE REPORTED EACH. EACH YEAR BY MARCH FIRST AND THEN THE- ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE SO THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO IT. AND THERE'S A EXTENDED TIME ON MONITORING EXTENDED TIME ON. AND NEAR THE LINK THE PROCESS OF HOW LONG YOU KNOW THESE TO MONITOR ON FRACKING SITUATIONS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME OR DAYS AND NOW THEY DO IT. LEGALLY A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THE WEBSITE- AGAIN I AM NOT DEFENDING CAL JIM IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT- WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET CAUGHT UP WITH. AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THIS STUFF IS AVAILABLE ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS TO THEM IS JUST. I MEAN IS THERE ANY WAY TO TAKE A PAUSE SO WE CAN. FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVEN'T STARTED COMPLYING WITH THE STUFF THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO LEGISLATIVE ACTION. THE LAST YEAR. I THINK THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS MORE TO. LESS TO CHANGE. IT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LET'S TO CHANGE THE ACTUAL SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENT AND MORE TO ELECTRONIC. ELECTRONIC FIVE- DID. MAKE THE PROCESS ELECTRONIC BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE MONTHLY REPORTS AND THOSE. THINGS ARE COMEBACKER LITERALLY STACKS OF PAPER. AND WE SAY PUT ON THE WEBSITE BUT THEN. YOU READY EIGHTY EIGHTY ISSUES RUN THE SCANNING ISSUES. YOU KNOW- BACKLOG SO IF WE CAN MAKE THE PROCESS ELECTRONIC WE THINK THAT MONTHLY PROCESS IN THE COURT OF THE PROCESS WILL GO A LOT FASTER. AND THERE'S A FEW PIECE OF DATA THAT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE I THINK IT'S- ACID WELL TREATMENTS AREN'T IN THERE AND THEN ALSO. THE HISTORIC PEACE I GUESS. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SORT OF ON GOING NEW ACTIVITY BUT I THINK IT'S THE IT'S THE WILL HISTORY. AND THE HISTORY ON THE NOTICES OF VIOLATION OR THE HISTORIES OF. OF A DIFFERENT TREATMENTS AND THAT WELL. THAT AREN'T. DIGITIZED AND THERE AREN'T ON THEY ARE IN THE FILES RIGHT NOW AND INFORMING WILL STAR SO THAT'S- THAT'S WHY WE'RE RUNNING IT NOT. NOT AT SPACE BEING SLOW OF NEW SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS. GET THE PROCESS TO WORK I THINK IS THE PRIMARY GOAL. THAT'S THAT THAT PMR COMMITTEE. OKAY AND SO WHEN YOU TALK TO US RECENTLY SAID ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WELL SO YOU HAVE AN OPERATOR. FOR INSTANCE I'VE AN OPERATOR THAT'S TRYING TO GET A TRANSFER OF SOMEBODY WHO'S- GONNA BAN THE WELLS I MEAN THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE ABANDONED AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM BUT WE HAVE A VIABLE OPERATOR. THAT WANTS TO TAKE OVER THOSE WELLS TO MAKE THEM PRODUCTIVE- IN MY DISTRICT AND THERE'S BEEN A- HUGE CHALLENGE. TO TRY TO GET PERMITS TO- TRANSFER ACQUISITION TO TAKE PLACE. WHEN WORKING WITH CALDERON CALLE JIM ON THAT. AND I'M JUST USING HIS EXAMPLE. THE REASON WHY THERE'S A PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE VIABLE OPERATOR IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT HAPPENED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WITH THIS WELL. CAME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED. BUT IT WOULD MAKE THIS NEW VIABLE OPERATOR RESPONSIBLE. AND SO I GUESS THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF STUFF THAT HAS TO BE THERE WHEN THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO WAY. TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS WERE REGULATOR FIFTY. AGO THINGS AREN'T. THE WAY THEY ARE. SO THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT IN FOR. UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST WHAT. KIND OF- REQUIREMENTS AS YOUR BILL GOING TO REQUIRE THESE OPERATORS TO BE OUR PRODUCERS. TO GO BACK AND- FOR HOW LONG WHAT PERIOD OF TIME AND RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT'S REQUIRED I MEAN IF YOU AN OPERATOR THAT AT THE END OF THE WELL AND SOMEBODY TOOK IT OVER AND TRIED TO FIX IT AND THEN THEY DID AND THEY RAN IT FOR AWHILE AND THE BANDIT YOU KNOW IS GONNA YOU KNOW IT WAS TRANSFERRED AGAIN. THERE'S GOT TO BE A POINT IN HISTORY WHERE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS HAS HAPPENED TO THESE PARTICULAR. WELL YES I AGREE AND I THE BILL DOES NOT FORCE THEM TO NECESSARILY REACH BACK AND- DIDN'T GET NEW HISTORY IT'S- IT'S GETTING THOSE WELL. THE EXISTING WELL HISTORIES ONLINE AND MANAGEABLE. BUT I I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IF. IF THERE'S SOME IMPLICATION OF THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY HAVE TO. GO THROUGH SOME EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES ARE IMPRACTICABLE EFFORTS OR WHATEVER TO FIND. I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I WAS NOT THE INTENTION TO. TAKE UP A WHOLE NEW- YET TO GO DO THE FORENSICS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO- MORE SO JUST MAKING PROCESS WITH THAT COMPLETE YOUR- YOUR QUESTION. YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. LET ME ADD SOMETHING I WAS WAITING FOR A BREAK IN THE CONVERSATION. AND THAT IS IT. A PRIOR INCARNATION- OF THE THINGS WE DID WHEN IT WAS DARKER WE BROUGHT IN A STRIKE TEAM BECAUSE THERE WERE FIFTY THOUSAND HISTORIC PERMITS. AND TRY TO DIGITIZE ALL OF THEM. AND THAT WAS NOT. ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS DONE BY THE AGENCY THEMSELVES AND HE ONE THING. IS I HAVE NO IDEA THE STATUS I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY GOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH I KNOW- PARTWAY THROUGH- IN WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. IS IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY THAT AND THEN YOU COULD SPEAK TO YOUR BILL IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY AND IF IT IS BASICALLY. THAT NOW THINGS WILL BE SUBMITTED IN A DIGITAL FORMAT SO THAT THE AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND DIGITIZED THEM AFTER THE FACT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD FACT TO KNOW AS THE BILL IS MOVING FORWARD AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT IS THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IN CASE THE BILL GETS OUT TODAY BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR NEXT STOP IN JUST A POINT OF A CENTER GROVE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. M. AND I APPRECIATE THE TEARS IMMENSE HISTORY ESPECIALLY AS BEING THE SECRETARY- IN THE IN A PREVIOUS LIFE M. SO I APPRECIATE HIS IMMENSE HISTORY AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF HIS- COMMENTS BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC REALLY DOES UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S NOT THE AGENCY THAT PAYS FOR THIS IT'S INDUSTRY THAT FUNDS THIS AGENCY THAT PAYS FOR THIS SO AGAIN IT'S AND IT'S INDUSTRY SO EVEN IF INDUSTRY DID TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BILLS OR OF SACRAMENTO WELLS AND- AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO FIX THESE IN IT AND THEN AGENCY PAYS FOR THEM THE- AGENCY GETS THE FUNDING FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PURPOSE BY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME I KNOW WE'VE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST- AGAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE OIL INDUSTRY JUST REPRESENT THE LARGEST PORTION OF IT AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE COMING UP THANK YOU THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR STERN YOU MICHAEL. A MIXTURE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR SUGGESTION AND WILL TAKE YOU AT THAT THE LETTER WE SENT TO SECRETARY CROWFOOT ACTUALLY ASKED THAT QUESTION OF STATUS ON WORLD HISTORY IN COMPILATION SO. WE SHOULD BE HEARING HOPEFULLY BACK IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO INFORM OUR EFFORTS AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE- ANYONE WITH A MOTION. THE BILL WAS MOVED BY SENATOR EGGMAN. OF WOULD. YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM THREE S. B. FOUR OH SIX THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. WHERE'D HI. ALL RIGHT JONES. ALLEN EGGMAN EGGMAN ALL RIGHT GROWTH. HERTZBERG HERTZBERG HI HUESO LIMóN. SHE'S MUTED A SENATOR YOU MOAN I READ YOUR LIPS AND YOU VOTED DIED BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT. WOULD LIKE TO YUP WOULD. DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO UN MUTE SENATOR LIMóN OTHER THAN CENTER LAMONT. IF DR ALTHOUGH THE SIGN. KEEP TRYING ONE MORE TIME. YEAH DID THE CHAIR READ HER LIPS. AND SHE JUST SAID I VERY DRAMATICALLY. IT IS CLEARLY CENTERMAN LIMóN SO WE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT AS AN AYE VOTE KEEP GOING EASTERN. STERN HI. K. THEIR FIVE VOTES WILL PUT THAT ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DON'T MOVE SENATOR STERN BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB FOUR ONE NINE POINT SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND LET ME NOTE TO THE AUTHOR OF SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN YOUR NEXT- SO COMPLICATED PLEASE PROJECT MR I'LL I'LL BE AS BRIEF AS I POSSIBLY CAN HERE AND IN LIGHT OF. THE PENDING A DISCUSSION ON ON THE NEXT BILL- FIRST OF ALL SHE THE STAFF'S WORK ON THIS HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THE THAT ARE MENTIONED IN YOUR ANALYSIS AT THIS BILL IS. IS REALLY ABOUT. THE WORKING PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN RESPECT TO- THE LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY AROUND THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA WRESTLE WITH SOME SOME TOUGH ISSUES HERE TODAY AND GOING FORWARD AS WE- AS WE ENGAGE THE OIL. CONVERSATION AND THE CLIMATE CONVERSATION MORE BROADLY BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO LAND ON A UNLIKELY CONSENSUS BETWEEN UNLIKELY PARTNERS- THAT SAYS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORK WE DO TO MAKE OUR- OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. SAFER TO CLOSE- THESE ABANDONED WELLS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- TO PLUG THESE IDLE WELLS WHEN THERE WERE TAKEN OUT OF COMMISSION OR DESERTED THAT THAT THAT WORK SHOULD BE DONE BY SKILLED AND TRAINED- CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND NOT. FROM TURN AROUND JOBS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE STATE- THEY DON'T BENEFIT OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES WHEN YOU SEE A- COMMUTER PLANE COMING IN FROM TEXAS FILLED WITH OIL AND GAS WORKERS YOU YOU WONDER IF THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE- WHEN WE HAVE.

SENATOR HERTZBERG ENGLISH CHAIR- SENATOR STERN AYE AYE I WOULD LIKE IN THE MOST- INSIGHTFUL WAY TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE INTEGRATION. BETWEEN THIS MEASURE FILE IN REPORT AND FOUND FIVE WHICH YOU SUPPORT SUPPORT LAST YEAR IF IN pBECAUSE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY RELATE. IF IN FACT THE IDEA HERE IS SKILLED AND TRAINED AND F. AND I LOOKED AT THE LIST HERE AND AS I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW ALONG ALMOST EVERYBODY IN SUPPORT OF YOUR MEASURE FOUR ONE NINE AS OPPOSED TO THE NEXT MEASURE. OF SENATOR WIENER'S AND SO MY QUESTION IS. IT IN YOUR DEADLINE DATES HERE ON THE AMENDMENTS AMENDMENT ONE PAGE OF FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT. APPLIES TO CONTRACTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT SAME DATE APPEARS AND IT WAS AMENDED BY PEERS IN THE OTHER MEASURE. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW YOU CAN WORK ON THIS LONGER THAN I HAVE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I'D LOVE TO JUST SURE GET YOUR SUCH THOUGHTS ON THAT. IF YOU WOULD IF YOU SHARE WITH US THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SIR- I'M LOOKING AT THE TIMELINE YOU MENTION HERE. YET. THIRTY TWO EIGHTY ONE- HOW THE TIME LINES WOULD LINE UP I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO PRESENT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR INTENTIONS ON TIME FRAME- I THINK THAT MAY BE. BEING PROPOSED TO I DON'T I DON'T TO GET AHEAD OF THE AUTHOR BUT- FOR WHATEVER TIME FRAME WERE PUT ON HERE. BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S OUR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE MOST SKILLED SAFEST WORKING CONDITIONS WE CAN HAVE- SO I GUESS THAT'S THE SPACE THIS BILL TRYING TO FILL WHILE THE WHILE THE BROADER DEBATE GOES ON OKAY THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THAT NOTHING FOR THEM STRIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER MEMBERS YES CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT FIRST BY PUSHING THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD OFFLINE I DO APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO- STORIES. I GUESS ABOUT- MY DISTRICT AND THE JOBS THAT ARE AFFECTED. BY LEGISLATION LIKE THIS I KNOW THAT- THEY WERE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF- SIGNATORY COMPANIES ORGANIZATIONS UNION ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME FORWARD AND SAID. THIS WOULD BE GREAT AND WHEN THEY DID IT WITH C. OR C. IT WAS GREAT WITH HIM IT WAS GREAT FOR THEM. BUT IT WAS A GREAT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE LOCAL PEOPLE. THAT LOST THEIR JOBS MY CONSTITUENTS. THE WILDER PER SE THAT HAD WORKED THERE FOR FORTY YEARS. TAKE A WELDER IN IT THAT WORKS AT CHEVRON UNDER CONTRACTOR NOW AND I'M JUST TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WORKING IN THE OIL FIELDS- IN. A WELDER THAT HIS MOTHER WAS CUT TO FIT PAINT TO MATCH. THIS CONTRACTOR HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST MODERATES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SAFEST CONTRACTORS YOU CAN HAVE IN THE OIL FIELDS BUT THEY'RE NOT SIGNATORY THEY'RE NOT UNION- WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WHAT HAPPENS TO. THE JERRY FLORES WHO SPENT TIME IN PELICAN BAY PRISON. A CAME OUT IN WORKS FOR AN OIL INDUSTRY CONTRACTOR AND OIL INDUSTRY CONTRACTOR. AND HE JUST BOUGHT HIS FIRST TIME IN THE SUN IS THE FIRST PERSON IN HIS FAMILY THAT'S GONE TO- COLLEGE. EVERYBODY ELSE'S BEEN ON- HIGH SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN THE SENATE'S FIRST WIN. AT THIS INDIVIDUALS A MEMBER OF HIS PTA MEETING HE'S GOT TATTOOS EVERYWHERE- HE'S CHANGES LIFE BECAUSE IT WILL INDUSTRIES AFFORDED HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CRANE OPERATORS THAT ALL SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED AT SEARS SEED THEY LOST THEIR JOB. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY FOR YEARS AND THEY WERE ALL LOCAL LIVING IN KERN COUNTY LIVING IN BAKER SMELLED. AND DIDN'T COME IN FROM TEXAS AND THEY CAN COME IN FROM ANY OTHER STATE THEY LIVED. MOST OF THEM STARTED THERE WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS. A BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE- CARD IN THEIR WALLET AND THEY SAID THEY WERE PART OF A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE OR AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ON ANY OF THEM UNION SAID SPOKE UP TODAY. M. AND I'M NOT PICKING ON THE INSIDE THINK. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A JOB WHETHER YOU'RE SIGNATORY OR NOT SIGNATORY. THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT INCLUDES GETTING PLAYED IN THE KERN COUNTY OIL FIELDS THAT ARE- THAT HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM. BECAUSE THEY COME FROM PRISON SYSTEMS THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON WE'D CRUISE AND THEN GO UP TO- PLC BOARDS ARE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS OR- WELDERS WELDERS HELPERS CRANE OPERATORS THEY CAN. THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED A COLLEGE DEGREE ANY SPECIFIC EDUCATION. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENT AND EXISTING. BECAUSE WHEN C. OR C. HAPPENED THOSE CONTRACTORS. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVEN GET A SEPARATE AND CREATE A UNION COMPANY EMPLOYEE UNION THEY HAD TO GO BACK THROUGH THE LABOR HALL OR TWO THROUGH THE HALL WHATEVER CALL IT WAS. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SENIORITY THAT OTHER. A UNION PEOPLE DID. SO THEY ALL LOST THEIR JOBS AND A LOT OF THEM WENT TO TEXAS AND OTHER PLACES SO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THESE LOCAL PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAVE THESE JOBS I MEAN IF THE CONTRACTOR IS WILLING TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE AND OFFER BENEFITS WHICH- THEY OFFER BENEFITS NOW BUT THEY DON'T PAY PREVAILING WAGE. IS THERE AN EGG AN EXCEPTION OR EXEMPTION THERE. WHAT HAPPENS TO HAVE OUR CABLE HOOD WHO HAS HIS OWN- TWELVE LITTLE WELLS THAT HE OPERATES IN HIS SON AND HIS THREE EMPLOYEES IN HIS GRANDSON OPERATE THAT. OF SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO MY LOCAL COMMUNITY. WHEN YOUR BILL PASS. MISTER CHAIR NUMBER EIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND YOUR FLUENCY IN. THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE IT. YOU KNOW THEM BY NAME AND YOU KNOW THEIR WORK CLOSELY- THE FOCUS THIS BILL WAS. WAS ABOUT A BROADER TREND WE'RE SEEING IN TURN AROUND JOBS IN THE MIDSTREAM SERVICES SECTOR THAT WAS SORT OF MY INITIAL CONCERN. ABOUT THE LEGISLATION- BUT AS FOR SORT OF THE LOCAL IMPACT FOR HOWARD I SEE OUR C. TYPE PARTNERSHIP WOULD PLAY OUT IF THAT WERE SCALED- I HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH ONE OF THOSE MYSELF I KNOW THAT. WE DID HAVE PEOPLE- I THINK OUR I. B. W. ELEVEN LEAD WITNESS WENT THROUGH THAT OR WHICH PART OF ONE OF THOSE DEALS THAT THE THUMBS WORKER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT IS IT ALRIGHT IF I. ASK JUST FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THEY SEE IT PLAYING OUT GOOD FOR SOMEBODY'S GOING THROUGH IT SENATE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY DID YOU MY MISTER JUST WHAT.

FIVE SENATOR WINNER WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES AND I WANNA. REALLY THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US FOR. MONTHS ON THE ROLE IN HELPING US MAKE A- IS GOOD A BILL AS IT CAN BE- ON I WANT TO JUST ALSO KNOWLEDGE ARMOR JUST MENTION AS I THINK SUCH A CENTERS FIRST. REFERRED TO EARLIER- WE DO HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE AUTHOR AMENDMENTS AT THE COMMITTEE WAS KIND ENOUGH. TO ALLOW US TO SUBMIT- LEE AND THEY ARE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE- FOR THAT- AND FOR THE BULK OF THE EXTRACTION. PHASE OUT- IT'S A LEASE. THAT TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ON THE THIRTEEN YEAR BY THE WAY AND THAT WAS BASED ON NEW DATA. THAT CAME OUT- DATA IN TERMS OF EXTRACTION HAS BEEN A LITTLE SKETCHY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE GOT SOME NEW DATA. AND SO WE MADE REVISIONS AND A BILL TO ALLOW FOR. A LENGTHY TRANSITION PERIOD. SO COLLEAGUES- SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN I KNOWLEDGE THIS IS IT'S A BIG BILL- AND IT'S TOUGH BUILT. ON ONE LEVEL. IT'S TOUGH FOR MORE LEVEL IT ISN'T- THAT'S FOUR SIXTY SO. WILL HELP JUMP BECOME. OF HAL AND WHEN. CALIFORNIA WILL PHASE OUT- WILL EXTRACTION IN THE STATE. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THE BILL FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE- DOES MOST DESTRUCTIVE FORMS OF THE BOIL EXTRACTION. IN HAND STE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES- THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS INCLUDING HARMING THE HEALTH OF FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CHILDREN- SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES- A BUFFER ZONE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET- AROUND WHERE PEOPLE LIVE GO TO SCHOOL WHERE KIDS ARE PLAYING ON PLAYGROUNDS SENSITIVE AREAS- WE'RE FRANKLY WE SHOULD NOT. BE DRILLING- AND FINALLY TEST BEFORE SIXTY SEVEN. WILL DIRECT THE STATE TO IDENTIFY FORMER OIL WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS- AND INCENTIVIZE WILL WELL REMEDIATION CONTRACTORS TO HIRE THOSE WORKERS- AND I THINK THIS DOVETAILS WITH THE PASSED BILL AS I THINK WAS REFERENCE BEFORE- THAT THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT ENORMOUS AMOUNT. OF INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL WORK THAT HAS TO HAPPEN TO PLUG REMEDIATE OILFIELDS ORPHAN WELLS- AND THOSE SHOULD BE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PASSED. A BILL. BECAUSE WE NEED TO REALLY- BE BLIND HERE. IN CALIFORNIA- WE VIEW OURSELVES. AS A GLOBAL LEADER ON HERE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND CLIMATE ACTION. AND IN MANY WAYS WE ARE THIS STATE HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON CLIMB IN SO MANY WAYS BUT NOT UNIVERSALLY. AND THERE IS A LARGE STAIN ON CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE RECORD AND THAT IS WHILE. WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST OIL EXTRACTION STATES KERN COUNTY IS THE SEVENTH LARGEST OIL PRODUCING COUNTY IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. BANKER COUNTY PRODUCES 3% OF TOTAL US OIL. PRICES SOMETIMES CALIFORNIA IS VIEWED AS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF FAIR TAXES ON THIS WE REALLY ARE NOT. AND NOT ONLY- OUR PRODUCTION NUMBERS QUITE LARGE- IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY MAJOR OIL PRODUCING STATES WITHOUT A STATEWIDE MANDATORY BUFFER ZONE OR DISTANCE BETWEEN A HOME OR A SCHOOL AND AN ACTIVE WELL. TEXAS HAS ONE. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT. THEN OF THE OIL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO STILL EXTRACT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA THE QUALITY OF THAT OIL HAS DECREASED TO SUCH A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT. THAT WE ARE NOW ON PAR WITH THE DIRTIEST SANDS. OIL FIELDS IN CANADA. DOTTORE CALIFORNIA IS. SO TO SUGGEST AS SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HAVE THE CALIFORNIA IS SOMEHOW A MODEL OF SAFE AND CLEAN OIL EXTRACTION IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE EXTRACT AND WHERE WE EXTRACTED NEAR WHERE PEOPLE LIVE NEAR WHERE KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL. THESE ENHANCED DRILLING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS FRACKING OR LINKED TO PRENATAL COMPLICATIONS CHILDHOOD ILLNESS INCREASED RATES OF ASTHMA AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. AND UNSURPRISINGLY HIGHER RATES OF CANCER. THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THESE ACTIONS ARE NOT JUST A LIST OF SYMPTOMS. OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE WITHIN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET OF AN ACTIVE OIL WEALTH IN OUR STATE. OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL WITHIN A HALF MILE OF INACTIVE OIL WEALTH MOST OF WHOM ARE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR. THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CANNOT LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. A HEALTHY LIFE NEAR AN OIL WELL TEN LET'S BE CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT CLIMATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LIVING NEAR THESE WELLS. PLEASE CALIFORNIANS ARE REMINDED EVERY DAY OF THE CHOICES THAT FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES MAKE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS. AND HEY'RE LIVING IN THESE ARE FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LIVING OUT. THE POTENTIAL OIL SPILLS AS WE'VE SEEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE FROM BOTH FOR PRODUCTION AND REFINING- THE INTENSE INCREASING AIR POLLUTANTS AND NOISE AND LIGHT POLLUTION THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. AT CETERA THEY'RE ALL CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT IN OF THEMSELVES BUT THIS ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IS NOT HAPPENING IN A VACUUM IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. ALMOST LITERALLY IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS. WHEN IT COMES TO OIL CALIFORNIA IS FAR FROM BEING A LEADER ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN OFFERS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT OUR COURSE AND PUT US ON A TRACK TO BE A GLOBAL LEADER AND HOW WE APPROACH. OIL HOW DO I SAY BECAUSE WE I KNOW THIS IS A BIG BILL AND I THAT I'VE EXPRESSED A DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE HAD FLEXIBILITY ON THIS BILL FROM THE BEGINNING THIS BILL IS A CONVERSATION WE KNOW THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY- AND IF IT MOVES FORWARD IN THE LEISLATURE. IT WILL BE A CONVERSATION TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IN CONECTION WITH THE LAST BILL. AND SENATOR THE MOANS BILLS ETCETERA. ABOUT HOW DO WE APPROACH WILL BIG PICTURE GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A LONG AND A GRADUAL TRANSITION IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT WHICH IS WHY WE ARE PROPOSES AMENDMENTS. WITHOUT A TIME LINE. IN TERMS OF THIS INDUSTRY. WE WILL SEE IF I CAN GET KICKED DOWN THE ROAD OVER AND OVER EVEN AS THE WHEEL AND THE STREET NATURALLY DECLINES. LOOK AT THE COAL INDUSTRY. WE DIDN'T ACT WE DIDN'T ACT WE DIDN'T ACT AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE INDUSTRY. AND THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT HAS CAUSED IN COMMUNITIES. WE SHOULD THE SHOULD BE FACILITATED PROCESS. WHERE WE LOOK OUT FOR THE WORKERS AND WE COME UP WITH A STRONG TRANSITION PLAN. THAT'S BEFORE SIXTY SEVEN STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THE BUFFER ZONE. A LIMITING FACTOR ELIMINATING FRACKING QUICKLY AND THEN HAVING A GRADUAL PHASE OUT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. WITH ME TODAY- AS OUR LEAD WITNESSES- JUST ONE LEAD WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN JUAN FLORES WHO IS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO HAVE ON THE LINE FOR TECHNICAL RESPONSES IF THEY COME UP- BUT NOT AS A TESTIFYING WITNESS STAND RATS WHO IS A STAFF ATTORNEY. AT THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME JUST CLARIFY BECAUSE I HAD TO LEAD WITNESSES LISTED YOU JUST HAVE ONE NOW VIRGINIA CRIME. WORK ONE ON STANDBY IF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OKAY- THEN WE WILL MOVE TO JUAN FLORES FROM THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND ENVIRONMENT YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS WOEFULLY AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE LEGAL HEARING COMPOUND. THE FATHER OF THE VERY CHILDREN SEVEN MONTHS OLD SOCIAL INTO YOUR BEAUTIFUL PENELOPE. WHEN I MIGRATED TO CALIFORNIA I CAME HERE WITH HOPES AND DREAMS OF LIVING IN A BETTER LIGHT IN SOME WAYS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE THOSE HOPES. BUT I HAVE SEEN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO BURKE DISPROPORTIONATELY BECAUSE TO THEM- I HAVE ZERO TWO MINUTES FOR TO CALL REPORTER QUALITY. HELLO WATER AND DIRTY SO IT. I HAVE SEEN MY NOTEBOOK NEIGHBORS WE ENDED TO. ASTHMA. INDUSTRY TALK SICK PROFIT MARGINS. THANK CALIFORNIA FALLING BEHIND ALL THE STATE. FARM HELP AND GAS SETBACK. THAT HAVE BEEN TRACKING.

UNFORTUNATELY YES BEFORE SIXTY SEVEN RESULT WAS THE RESULT IN THE LOSS OF FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS AND WILL HIT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PARTICULARLY HARD I THINK WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS THIS THAN THIS MORNING IN OPPOSITION. OR AS YOU SAY THE MAJORITY OF THIS OIL IS PRODUCED BY ELIMINATING ALL OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN- ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TAX REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION WHICH THE STATE HEAVILY RELIES ON IN ITS GENERAL FUND. IF ENACTED FOR SIXTY SEVEN ALSO SUBJECTS THE STATE UP TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL LIABILITY AND FINALLY S. B. FOR SIXTY SEVEN IMPLIES THAT LOCAL OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IS NOT ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL AND WILL DISRUPT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. DURING THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC NEARLY NEARLY EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ALL ELEMENTS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY CHAIN AS ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY ECONOMY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THOSE OF THOSE THERE'S- SOME THINGS THAT BRING BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. SENATOR I THANK YOU CENTER JONES YES IT DOES. FIFTY THOSE ARE THE TALKING POINTS- OF THE OPPOSITION- TO THE BILL- AND- WE- WE- CERTAINLY- I DON'T AGREE WITH THEM I THINK PART OF THE NARRATIVE THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS ATTEMPTED TO PAINT. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SOMEHOW THIS SELF CONTAINED OIL ECOSYSTEM WHICH IS NOT TRUE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S REFINERIES WHICH ARE REALLY A SEPARATE INDUSTRY FROM THE OIL EXTRACTION CALIFORNIA REFINERIES. IMPORT SOMETHING LIKE 70% OF THE OIL THEY REFINED TO ALREADY TODAY TO SUGGEST THAT WERE SAID THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF SELF CONTAINED. CALIFORNIA IS WE'LL INDEPENDENT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA'S REFINERIES. EXPORT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF A REFINED OIL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WE DRILL IT HERE THEN IT'S REFINED HERE AND THEN IS CONSUMED HERE AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO MAKE A CALIFORNIA HAVE TO RELY ON OTHER WILL THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING- AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BOND AND YOU KNOW I THINK- YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY WE HAVE PROPOSES AMENDMENTS. TO EXTEND THE BILL AL IN TERMS OF THE BOOK OF THE EXTRACTION DOWN A LARGE MAJORITY LOOKS TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. IS PRECISELY TO IMPACT TO ENABLE THAT TRANSITION SO IT'S NOT HAPPENING AROUND THOSE IMAGE CAME FROM FROM US THEY WEREN'T REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE WE ASK FROM OUR SPONSORS. BEST FOR IT IN ORDER TO TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND YET YES ARE THERE IMPACTS IN THE BILL OF COURSE LOOKING TO GET OPTIONS TO THERE ARE NO IMPACTS IMPACTFUL BUILT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHT NOW. AND YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU KNOW OUR LEAD WITNESS- EVEN CENTRAL VALLEY RESIDENTS VALLEY RESIDENTS WHO ARE BEING ETCETERA WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED IN TERMS OF THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH RIGHT NOW SO YOU KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE AS I THINK KNOWLEDGE. IF THIS BILL MOVES TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BUT IF IT DOES- YOU KNOW WITH THIS WILL BE A WORK IN PROGRESS WE KNOW THAT BUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY SET UP THE STRUCTURE. SAID. WE STOPPED TAKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. THANK YOU OTHER SENATORS. SENATOR EGGMAN THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU TO. SENATOR WINNER FOR BRINGING US A OF THIS BILL- I WILL I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND- AND I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT IT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GUIDANCE I AM CERTAIN ON NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS IS MY SECOND HOUSE NOW- FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE BILLS THAT COME EVERY YEAR AND EVERY YEAR IT'S THE BIGGEST BELL EVERY YEAR'S BIGGEST BELL- THAT GO TOWARDS AB MANAGING. REGULATING THE OIL INDUSTRY- AND IF THIS BILL AND SO EVERY I MEAN TO CHOICE UP UNTIL JUST A SAY BY ME AND ON BOTH SIDES RIGHT EVERY YEAR IT'S THE WORST IT'S THE BEST IT'S THE WORST IT'S BEST IT'S THE DEFINING. EVERY YEAR RIGHT SO IT'S- AND HERE'S ONE MORE AND THIS ONE REALLY DOES GO TO SHUT DOWN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA- IF IT WERE JUST FRACKING EVERYONE KEEPS ON THE FRACKING BELL. AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A VERY SMALL COMPONENT OF OIL PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA END OF THIS BILL FRACKING IS A VERY SMALL CONSCIOUS FRACKING OKAY SKERRITT FRACKING. PUSH JUST SETBACKS. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A LOT LAST YEAR VOTED FOR ONE THAT'S A THEY CONSIDER THAT. WE COULD EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THE EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT- WHEN AS YOU AS YOU HAVE SAID. WE ARE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM OIL OR GAS IT IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE NEXT IN NEXT TEN YEARS. I HAVE AN ELECTRIC CAR. NOW I'M I AM NOT I AM A ONE INCOME FAMILY I DON'T I CAN'T AFFORD. A TESLA I GOT MY SHOVEL KIA. I ALSO I IS TWENTY FIVE MILES I DO MY PART I GET TWENTY FIVE MILES GIVES ME HALF WAY TO WORK BECAUSE LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS. I COMMUTE EVERY DAY I'M IN MY CAR TWO HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY BACK AND FORTH. AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT TIME ON THE ROAD EXHAUST ME BUT I DON'T HAVE A I DON'T HAVE A RAIL SYSTEM TO USE THAT I CAN GO BACK AND FORTH USUALLY. SO I HAVE TO DRIVE. AND I HAVE TO DRIVE. AGAIN PART OF THAT IS ELECTRIC AND PART OF IT IS NOT. AND I CONSIDER MYSELF INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD ONE THAT WON'T GET TO MIDDLE TWENTY FIVE MILES. OF ELECTRIC AND I'M JUST THINK ABOUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIANS AND MY DISTRICT THE PEOPLE WHO COMMUTE. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DRIVE TRUCKS THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE TRACTORS. NONE OF THOSE ARE ELECTRIC WILL LIKE TO TRAVEL THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ELECTRIC SO WE WOULD HAVE TO TRANSITION OFFENSE AND- THEN I AND I DO GREE WITH THE OPPOSITION. THAT THE JUST TRANSITION OF JOBS IS- IS VERY VERY VERY SLIM AND NOT AND NOT REAL. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OF THIS IS A MAJOR IMPACT OF THIS- IS THE ACCUSED AMOUNT OF JOBS AND THE CORRESPONDING JOBS THAT WILL BE LOST THAT GO. ALONG WITH THIS SO. THAT WE IT THE END JUST TO JUSTICE. THIS TO SAY OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIVING BY BY WELLS THIS CLOSE IT IS UNSAFE. AND CALIFORNIA DOES IT SAY FOR THAT. ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS I KNOW. WE ARE MORE REGULAR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. SO WHAT WE PRODUCE IS THE SAFEST SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE STILL GOING TO USE IT BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO USE IT FROM PLACES THAT PRODUCE AT ALL LESS SAFELY. WITH CARE FOR THOSE AROUND AND WE DO HERE. SO I AM ALL FOR LET'S LET'S CONTINUE TRANSITIONING OFF WITH ALL DO OUR PART. BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE QUITE THERE YET AND THIS BILL ASSUMES THAT WE ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER SENATORS CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MISTER GERALD IS FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON'S COMMENTS YOU KNOW- THE STATE IS INSTALLED OVER ONE MILLION SOLAR ROOFS WE REGISTERED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE'VE ADDED TWELVE THOUSAND. MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ENERGY THE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY AND FOR THE UNITED STATES VEHICLES HAS INCREASED BY 25% GETTING BETTER FUEL ECONOMY ECONOMY. DURING THIS LAST THIRTY YEARS OF TRANSITION CALIFORNIANS HAVE ONLY REDUCE THE OIL USAGE BY 6% AND WE ARE COUNTING ON OIL AND GAS- AND PETROCHEMICALS- WE WILL BE DEPENDED ON THEM FOR YEARS TO COME. IF YOU LOOK AT FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALIFORNIA FROM- IMPORTED OR BROUGHT IN FOUR POINT 5% OF OUR OIL FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WE PRODUCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA SAFELY AND UNDER THE MOST ADVERSE STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY PROCESSES. WE PRODUCED 50% OF THE OIL THAT WE USE HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW WE IMPORT ABOUT 70% FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WE PRODUCE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE NUMBERS THE GAP THAT WE HAD BACK THEN CAME FROM ALASKA. AGAIN NOT FROM ECUADOR OR VENEZUELA OR SAUDI ARABIA I'M LOOKING AT AN ARTICLE HERE WHICH I KNOW YOU PROBABLY CAN'T SEE. THIS ARTICLE HAS A PICTURE OF YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU CAN SEE IF I BLOW IT THIS ARTICLE HAS A PICTURE OF INDIGENOUS INDIANS. INDIGENOUS INDIANS IN A VENEZUELAN CORRIDOR- ECUADORIAN CORRIDOR THESE INDIGENOUS INDIANS THIS ARTICLE SAYS THAT DAY DID YOU JUST PEOPLE BLOCKED ECUADOR OIL AUCTION FROM GROWING AND A FIGHT TO SAVE THE AMAZON. I CAN TELL YOU IN KERN COUNTY IN CIMAREX BUILDING CHEVRON'S FIELDS THAT THEY OPERATE IN BEADS FILLED THAT THEY OPERATE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN KERN COUNTY WERE 70% OF THE OIL. IS PRODUCED WE ARE NOT FIGHTING OFF. IN YOU JUST IN THE- AND HAVE THEIR RAINFOREST COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY THE OIL TRIANGLES LIKE THEY'RE IN ECUADOR. AND CALIFORNIANS FOR. CONSUMPTION OF OIL HAS NOT DECREASED BUT 6% OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND WE CONTINUE TO IMPORT OIL FROM FOREIGN NATIONS THAT ARE NUMBER ONE HOSTILE TO US. NUMBER TWO HAVE DISMAL HUMAN RIGHTS- A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND ALSO HAVE THE WORST QUALITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THEY HAVE NOT IF THEY HAVE ZERO ZERO- CONSCIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WHATSOEVER YOU HAVE CHILDREN COVERED IN OIL WORKING IN THESE. CAMPS THESE- FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WE CAN PRODUCE THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS FOR YOU SO- I SEE ALL THAT JUST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BILL. AS WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL KNOW THIS BILL IS IN EXCHANGE FOR NINETEEN. WHILE I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT FOR NINETEEN TAKING AWAY THOUSANDS OF LOCAL JOBS TO THOSE THAT ARE- RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON. THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE OIL INDUSTRY FOR YEARS IF NOT DECADES- I GUESS IF IT IS UNIONIZED LIKE FOR NINETEEN IT INTENDS TO DO. AT LEAST THE OIL INDUSTRY WILL BECOME INSTANTLY SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. AND I GUESS THAT'S THE TRADE OFF THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS BUILDING SO WHILE I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL AND AS I HAVE NOT SUPPORTED FOR NINETEEN ANOTHER BILLS I DON'T FEEL THAT YOUR BILL IS AS BIG A THREAT. AS FOR NINETEEN S. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL HAS A CHANCE CAL PASSING BUT FOR NINETEEN WAS THEEXCHANGE FOR THE BILL'S FAILURE AND FOR NINETEEN WILL- WILL DESTROY THOUSANDS OF LOCAL JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY IN KERN COUNTY. THANK YOU. BAR OTHER COMMENTS FROM SENATORS. SENATOR ALAN. SENATOR TIME CAN YOU JUST GIVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT SORT OF FRONT LINE IMPACTS YOUR TRYING TO.

I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH OIL PRODUCTION DATING BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BOTH THE RENTER AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES AND- WHEN THE AUTHORED SPOKE TO ME ABOUT HIS INTENTION- AND HAVING REALLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL I AGREED TO COME ON. AS A JOINT AUTHORS AND DID SO BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY THAT MY DISTRICT HAS- WITH OIL EXTRACTION AND TRANSPORT REALLY AND- MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I'VE WORKED ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE AND- ISSUES THAT REALLY ARE DRIVEN BY THAT HISTORY IN MY DISTRICT WHERE WE WENT FROM RELYING SO MUCH- AS A COMMUNITY ON THIS FORM- OF OIL EXTRACTION FOR JOBS TO ALSO FEELING AND LIVING. A LOT OF THE IMPACTS WE'VE TALKED THE WORD IMPACT HAS BEEN USED SO MUCH TODAY- EMAIL WITH MEMBERS- AND WITH FOLKS CALLING IN AND THE IMPACT HAS VERY- THERE HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING IMPACTS AT TO OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE FORMS OF EXTRACTION- WHILE WE DON'T HAVE FRACKING- ANYMORE WE DO HAVE A CYCLIC STEAMING LOW LOW PRESSURE A CYCLIC STEAMING. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT PARTS OF THE DISTRICT LIKE TRACK CANYON THAT RANK AMONG THE TOP ONE PERCENT- FOR GROUND WATER THREATS BECAUSE OF THIS FORM. TRACTION ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. SO IT'S REALLY WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE- IN UNDERSTANDING- WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS RELIED ON EXTRACTION AND ALSO. A COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED INTO MANY WAYS- AND I DID STILL BE. YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD ON THE LOT OF WHAT EVERYONE SAID TO DATE I INCLUDE THOSE THAT CALLED IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION AND THE FACT THAT THIS BILL EXIST. AS ALLOWED FOR THIS LEVEL OF DISCUSSION AND IF THERE'S NOT A BILL THERE'S NOT A DISCUSSION. AND THESE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS I MEAN WE'RE GETTING INTO THE WEEDS OF WHAT DOES THE TIMELINE LOOKS FOR IS IT THIRTEEN YEARS IS IT MORE IS THAT LAST FOR WHAT FORMS OF EXTRACTION IN WHAT PARTS OF THE STATE WHAT KINDS OF AN IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE. WHAT DOES JUST TRANSITION MEAN. TO OUR STATE AND TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I HAVE HAD SOME VERY DIFFICULT BUT IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS WITH MY LOCAL I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO PARTNERS EIGHT OH FIVE TO LABOUR'S FIVE EIGHTY FIVE AND TWO TWENTY TWO YOU A PLUMBERS AND PIPEFITTERS ONE FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR.

I COMMEND THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN DIFFICULT THERE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW NAME CALLING THREATS ACCUSATIONS ALL OF THIS THAT IS COME WITH CARRYING A BILL THIS STATE- AND- I THINK IT'S ALLOWED FOR AN IMPORTANT TEST DISCUSSION. A DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I DON'T WANT CALIFORNIANS I DON'T WANT WORKERS TO BE LEFT BEHIND WE CAN LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND SEE PLACES WHERE WORKERS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. AND I WANTED TO SEE AT THE TABLE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE I FEEL SO STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE WAY. CALIFORNIA WORKERS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT BEHIND THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENGAGE. IN THIS DIFFICULT CONVERSATION. I THINK TODAY. YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THIS BILL AND HE- WILL AT. REALLY AND TASTES OF WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE APPETITE- OF WHERE WE MAY FALL BUT IT WON'T BE THE END OF THE CONVERSATION. JUST LOOK AROUND. THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THE STATE IN THE WORLD THAT ARE BEGGING FOR THIS CONVERSATION THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF ENERGY LOOKS LIKE. AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL REMAIN DESPITE WHATEVER MAY BE THE OUTCOME OF THIS CALL THIS BILL. I AM VOTING FOR THIS BILL I AM I JOIN AUTHOR WITH EITHER OUT YOU KNOW WITH THE US THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL RECOGNIZE THAT- IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS BUT IT'S NONETHELESS IMPORTANT AND THERE IS VALUE IN LEGISLATIVE REVIEW LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS. LEGISLATIVE DIALOGUE. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE I LAND. BUT I WANT TO GIVE THANKS US IN PARTICULAR TO THE AUTHOR- BECAUSE I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN TO CARRY A BILL OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND I KNOW HOW HARD AND HOW MUCH HE HAS WORK TO TRY TO LISTEN TO ALL SIDES. AND FIND A WAY TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION ALIVE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMENT. ANYTHING ELSE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR JOHN. IT'S JUST A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE SOONER YOU'RE- A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL AND- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE. HE YOU ALWAYS. BRING TOUGH ISSUES TO US AND THEN. PRISON I'M IN A VERY PROFESSIONAL MANNER AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THE ONE THING THAT WAS COMPELLING TO ME FROM YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ARE SOME OF THE CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES THAT THEY WERE BRINGING UP AND- AND OTHER ILLNESSES. I GAVE UP HIS MAGIC NUMBER SOME ADULT. STUFF TOO. CAN YOU JUST BRIEFLY. WHAT WHAT THAT INFORMATION COME FROM IS IT IS A SCIENTIFIC STUDY IS IT WHERE IT IS. ONE OF THOSE ISSUES HOW DO YOU WRITE TO THOSE ISSUES AND THOSE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED BY YOUR- SUPPORT WITNESSES. SURE THAT. SEVEN FIVE IT COMES OUR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OUR BEEN ENORMOUS NUMBER THE NORMA'S AMOUNT OF LITERATURE- AROUND THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF- OF OIL DRILLING ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH- AND- INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO- THE BUFFER ZONE OF SETBACKS ISSUE- AND THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET AS I MENTIONED RESPOND TO CENTER ALAN'S QUESTION WAS NOT A RANDOM NUMBER THAT COMES FROM- SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS- AND SO YOU KNOW IN SOME WOULD ARGUE FOR GREATER BUFFER ZONE BUT- BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT. YOU KNOW MATCH UP WITH THE EVIDENCE- SO THERE'S SIGNIFICANT LITERATURE I THINK SOME OF IT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY CITED AN ANALYSIS I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE IT. AND IT'S- IT'S READILY AVAILABLE. OKAY I'LL GET TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GROW. JUST ON FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN DIEGO'S QUESTION- HE HAS ANY I. R. IT'S BEEN VETTED NOW BEEN TESTED BY LAWSUIT ANYWAYS- THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A SCIENCE BASED SIX PACK A REGULATORY PROCESS- IN THE STATE SHOULD ACTUALLY MODEL IT- IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU BUT- WE HAVE A COMPLETE E. I ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY. BY CONSERVATIVE ADDRESSES THAT PARDON ME SIR ARTHUR WRITTEN SO THAT ADDRESSES THE SETBACK ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE FROM SENATORS. SENATOR WINNER YOU CAN CLOSE THANK YOU AND I THINK IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN APOLOGIZE IF I- MISINTERPRETING I THINK CENTER KIRBY REFERRING TO- THE MOST RECENT KERN COUNTY- APPROACH WHICH I THINK IS A TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FOOT. ON SETBACK MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT NEVER CAN TALK AFTERWARDS TO CLARIFY IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING KERN COUNTY JUST APPROVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IN THE FUTURE FOR THE FUTURE- OF NEW DRILLING SIS IS NOT LIKE. YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY ASSIST TAPERING OFF LIKE KERN COUNTY IS ACTIVELY APPROVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW OIL DRILLING PERMITS- WITH- I THINK IF I RECALL CORRECTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FOOT BUFFER ZONE. AND I THINK YOU KNOW ON THE SUSPECT'S PIECES BILL AND HIS WIFE SAID THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL AND WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY ON THIS BILL- IT'S ON ON SWITCH OFF SWITCHES ARE SET TO SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU WENT AROUND NOT JUST IN THE IMPACTED AREAS BUT AROUND CALIFORNIA. TO LA TO THE BAY AREA- THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO KNOW WE VALLEY INSURANCE YOU WANT AROUND TO THE STATE AND SAID WHAT DO YOU TINK ABOUT SOMEONE DRILLING FOR OIL A. HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM YOUR HOME. WHAT DO YOU ABOUT SOMEONE DREW FOR OIL. A HUNDRED HUNDRED FROM THEIR KIDS SCORE PLAYGROUND I BET YOU MOST PARENTS WOULD SAY IF THEY HAVE A PRIVILEGE. AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OFTEN DON'T HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE. A LOT OF PARENTS TO SAY I WOULD PULL MY KID OUT OF THAT SCHOOL IF THEY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE. OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT OR I WOULD NOT LET MY KID PLAY AT THE PLAYGROUND. WITH AN OIL DRILLING- WE'RE WELL ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FEET AWAY. I THINK PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE NOT IN THOSE FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES OFTEN DO NOT KNOW. THE CALIFORNIA HAS NO BUFFER ZONE. AND THEY ARE HORRIFIED. WHEN THEY HEAR THAT IN CALIFORNIA IT IS LEGAL TO DRILL NEXT TO SOMEONE'S HOME NEXT YEAR COULD SCHOOL. NEXT TO A PLAYER AND THAT IS IN DEFENSIBLE. INDEFENSIBLE I'M ONE TEXAS. HAS SET BACKS IN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T. I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF NO OFFENSE TO TEXAS. SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS CENTRE LIMóN SAID THIS BILL IS YOU KNOW IN MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND JUST TRANSITION IT'S PART OF IT AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN SOLVE EVERYTHING. COULD JUST TRANSITION ONE BILL AND THAT'S WHY THESE OTHER TWO BILLS FROM CENTER LOAN FROM CENTER STERN.

THANK YOU CHAIR- WAY- PERSON WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE IN THE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED SB EIGHT OH FOUR WOULD CREATE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTER TO TRAIN FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IN FORESTRY IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE AN ESTIMATED FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRES BURNED DUE TO WILDFIRES THESE FIRES DAMAGED OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES BECAUSE THIRTY THREE FATALITIES. THIS COMES AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH WERE THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. RECOGNIZING THAT THE DANGERS OF WILDFIRE WERE ONLY INCREASING THE SENATE CREATED. THE WILD FAR WORKING GROUP AND INTRODUCED A BUDGET FRAMEWORK THE PRIORITIZE FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE EFFORTS. SB EIGHT OH FOUR ACCOMPLISHES SEVERAL OF THE GOALS LAID OUT BY THIS WORKING GROUP. WITH COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. CENTER WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF EXPANDING THE WORK FORCE AND IMPLEMENTING A VEGETATION AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN. THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT ONLY WORK TOWARDS REDUCING THE TOLL OF WILDFIRES. BUT WOULD ALSO REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATES AND CREATE A PATHWAY TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLETED. CONFINEMENT IN LOCAL JAILS OR STATE INSTITUTIONS. CURRENTLY THE INCARCERATED AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED ALREADY PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE. SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE. THE W. CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT REPORTS AT DAVIS SAFELY ASSIGNED THOUSANDS OF INMATES TO FIRE CAMPS. UNDER THIS BILL THE CENTER WOULD TRAIN A MUCH NEEDED WORK FORCE TO DECREASE FUEL LOADS AND IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE AND WILDFIRE REDUCTION GOALS.
