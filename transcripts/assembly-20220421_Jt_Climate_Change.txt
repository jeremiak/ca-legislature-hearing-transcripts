STARTED. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. I'D LIKE TO CALL THE BEATING TO ORDER THIS IS THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES- WE WOULD LIKE TO A HIGH I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL. MORE MEMBERS- THAT INDICATED THAT THEY WILL BE ATTENDING AND SO WE'D LIKE TO- GET STARTED. THANK YOU TO ALL THAT ARE HERE- TODAY'S AGENDA IS A OUR ANNUAL UPDATE ON THE STATEWIDE TRENDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL AS- THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN. WE ARE EXCITED TO I GET A HOPEFULLY A PREVIEW OF THE UPCOMING SCOPING PLAN WE UNDERSTAND THE DRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED- AND A MATTER OF WEEKS- BUT- WE WILL BE HEARING FIRST FROM THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. MS LIANE RANDOLPH FOLLOWED BY THE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. DALLAS RETRO MEMBER. OF V. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CATHARINE GROUP- WHITE OF FOLLOWING THAT I I'D LIKE TO TAKE UP ALL QUESTIONS OF FOR ALL THREE SPEAKERS ARE- FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATION OF ALL. THREE AND SO WHAT WE LIKE TO GET STARTED. LET ME FIRST A TURN OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE A CENTER BACK OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT JUDY THANK YOU CHAIR I THANK EVERYONE AT THE A RESOURCES BOARD FOR THE PORT WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING OVERSEEING OUR CLIMATE POLICIES AND DEVELOPING THE LATEST SCOPING PLAN- THIS WORK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND- I'M- CARP DOES RECEIVE SOME CRITICISM INCLUDING EXPECT MAYBE SOME TODAY. FOR NOT GOING FASTER OR FOR GOING TO FASTER FOR LOTS OF WAYS. IN WHICH- THINGS COULD POSSIBLY BE BETTER I'M BUT I DON'T WANT TO FORGET THAT CARBS ONE THE MOST EXPERT AND AFFECTED REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR DRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND WE SHALL BE PROUD OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. EVEN IF WE CONTINUE TO PROD- IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY. THAT'S WHEN I THINK OF MEMBERS OF THE INDEPENDENT MISSIONS MARK ADVISORY COMMITTEE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE- YOU PRIDE CRUCIAL INDEPENDENT VIEW POINTS ABOUT HOW THIS WORK CAN BE DONE. DIFFERENTLY AND BETTER AND HELPS US ALL- BY DRIVE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO DIVING THE FINDINGS OF THE SCOPING PLAN MODELING SERIES TODAY AND HOPE THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN MAPPING OUT THE PATHWAY OPTIONS FOR GETTING TO NET ZERO. AND IT WILL CONTINUE REVISED REFINE THESE NET ZERO SCENARIOS AS WE CONSIDER OUR PA POLICY. OPTIONS SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS IMPORTANT WORK. THANK YOU OF I SHARE WE ALSO HAVE SENATORS- ALLEN AND STERN- CENTERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. IS YOUR MIKE ON NINE. OTHER NIGHT OF THERE AGAIN OKAY ALL RIGHT WELCOME J. AROUND OFF. ALL RIGHT SON YES OKAY ED THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- AND I THINK I HAVE SOME SLIDES YES- THIS ANNUAL HEARING IS ONE OF THE MANY FORMS OF REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT FOR CARBS CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO UPDATING YOU ON OUR PROGRESS ON AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS TRENDS. AND IMPORTANTLY ON THE WORK AHEAD TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND AVOID THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE IMPROVING AIR QUALITY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THIS YEAR IS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE AS WE WILL ADOPT A NEW SCOPING PLAN UPDATE WHICH WILL EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL AND CHART A PATH TO ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED CARB OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO WITH THE GOALS OF ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING AIR QUITE HEALTHY AIR QUALITY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM EXPOSURE TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. PROVIDING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR COMPLYING WITH AIR POLLUTION RULES AND REGULATIONS AND BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX OUR WORK. EXPANDED TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OKAY LET'S LOOK AT AIR QUALITY THE FEDERAL EPA SETS HEALTH BASED AIR STANDARDS AND AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO REGULARLY REVIEW THOSE STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HEALTH PROTECTIVE. OXIDES OF NITROGEN NITROGEN CALLED KNOX ARE ONE OF THE KEY SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS WE CONTROL TO PREVENT OZONE FORMATION. KNOX EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN STEADILY DECREASING SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DUE TO MULTIPLE REGULATIONS ADOPTED OVER TIME AND THIS CHART SHOWS THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THIS PROGRESS REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF BOTH CARB AND EPA PROGRAMS FOR MOBILE SOURCES LIKE CARS TRUCKS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. AS WELL AS AIR DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR STATIONARY SOURCES. BECAUSE OF THESE MOBILE SOURCES RESPONSIBLE 480% OF KNOX EMISSIONS MORE STRINGENT ENGINE STANDARDS CLEANER FUELS AN INCENTIVE FUNDING HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THIS PROGRESS. FOR EXAMPLE NEW CARS ARE 99% CLEANER THAN A CAR FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION WITH OUR ENGINE TESTING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS AND CONTINUES TO DO SO AT OUR NEW LAB IN RIVERSIDE THAT OPENED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. AS YOU KNOW THE STANDARD SET HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE COPIED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. THAT'S PEOPLE WELL BEYOND OUR BORDERS BENEFIT FROM CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN CLEAN AIR. WE HAVE ENDEAVORED ALONG WITH THE AIR DISTRICTS TO REDUCE RISK FROM EXPOSURE TO AIR TOXICS WHICH COME FROM REFINERIES SMALLER SOURCES LIKE GAS STATIONS AND MOBILE SOURCES LIKE DIESEL TRUCKS. CALIFORNIA'S AIR TOXICS PROGRAM BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL ACT. AND SINCE THEN THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HAZARDOUS TO HUMAN HEALTH INCLUDING LEAD BENZENE. TELL YOU MEAN AND AS BEST AS- TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURE TO THESE POLLUTANTS WE HAVE ADOPTED NUMEROUS REGULATIONS INCLUDING LIMITING THE LEVELS OF BENZENE IN GASOLINE. AND PHASING OUT THE USAGE OF CARCINOGENS AND DRY CLEANING BY TWENTY. TWENTY THREE. TODAY THE STATE'S EFFORTS CONTINUE TOFOCUS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS OF DIESEL PARTICULATES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70% OF TOTAL KNOWN CANCER RISK RELATED TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS SMOG SO THICK YOU COULDN'T SEE THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS FROM LOS ANGELES IS NOT JUST IN LIVING MEMORY BUT IN RECENT MEMORY. NOW THE AIR IS CLEANER STATEWIDE THIRTY THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS ARE AVOIDED EACH YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ASTHMA CASES HAVE BEEN AVOIDED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY AND ALL WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO MORE. APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS STILL LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT EXCEED FEDERAL HEALTH PROTECTIVE STANDARDS EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PARTICULATES IS TOO HIGH ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR FREIGHT FACILITY SUCH AS PORTS RAILYARDS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND THOSE THAT ARE CLOSE TO FREEWAYS AN INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. LET'S TURN TO GREENHOUSE GAS TRENDS THE CHART ON THE LEFT REPRESENT STATEWIDE ANNUAL GHG EMISSIONS FROM SOURCES IN THE AB THIRTY TWO INVENTORY FROM. TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY NINETEEN THE MOST RECENT YEAR WITH PUBLISHED DATA. SINCE THE PEAK LEVEL IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR CALIFORNIA'S GHG EMISSIONS HAVE GENERALLY FOLLOWED A DECREASING TREND. THESE ARE TWENTY NINETEEN EMISSIONS DUE TO WHEN DATA ACTUALLY BECOMES AVAILABLE TO CARB AND OUR NEED TO DO QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL CARP HAS NOT PUBLISHED ACTUAL DATA REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT TOOK HOLD IN TWENTY TWENTY. IN TERMS OF ANY MISSIONS OUTLOOK THE TWENTY TWENTY GHG EMISSIONS DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR. AND WILL LIKELY BE EVEN LOWER DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY REBOUNDED FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT IS LIKELY THAT GHG EMISSIONS WILL ALSO FOLLOW THE INCREASED ACTIVITY. MEANING TWENTY TWENTY MAYBE SEYMOUR IS AN OUT LIAR VERSES AS A GENERAL TREND MARKER BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE PLANTS AND SOILS IN LAND IS SEPARATELY QUANTIFIED IN CARDS NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS ECOSYSTEM CARBON INVENTORY. WHICH IMPORTANTLY INCLUDES WILDFIRE EMISSIONS. THIS INVENTORY TRACKS HOW MUCH CARBON EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA'S ECOSYSTEM AND WHERE THAT CARBON IS LOCATED AT DISCRETE MOMENTS IN TIME AND ESTIMATES HOW MUCH CARBON IS MOVING IN AND OUT OF THE VARIOUS PLAN TYPES AND CARBON POOLS. IT CONSISTS OF FOREST AND OTHER NATURAL LANDS CROPLANDS URBAN FORESTS WETLANDS AND SOIL CARBON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OR IN THAT SINK. THE GRASS ON THE RIGHT SHOW TRENDS IN CARBON STOCK CHANGE OVER TIME. NOTE THAT IN JUXTAPOSITION TO FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS WHERE THE GOAL IS TO SEE A DECLINING TREND. FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS WE TYPICALLY WANT TO SEE A STABLE OR INCREASING TREND IN CARBON STOCKS WHICH INDICATES INCREASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION OR ONGOING CARBON STORAGE AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SOIL IS THE LARGEST CARBON RESERVOIR INCLUDED IN THE INVENTORY. FOREST AND SHRUBLAND CARBON STOCKS ARE THE SECOND LARGEST CARBON POOL AND ALSO CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE LARGEST TOTAL CHANGES. IN TWENTY TEN CARBON STORED IN FORESTS AND SHRUBLANDS WAS 6% LOWER THAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE DUE TO A LARGE AND DUE TO A NUMBER OF LARGE WILDFIRES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN PERIOD. WOODY CROPS AND URBAN FORESTS BOTH GAINED CARBON AS THESE TREES ARE GENERALLY WELL MAINTAINED DUE TO THEIR ECONOMIC AND AESTHETIC VALUES. PART OF THE CARBON GAINS SEEN IN URBAN FOREST ALSO CAME FROM EXPANSION OF THE URBAN FOOTPRINT OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AS WE MOVE TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY NEUTRALITY WE NEED A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL CARBON EMISSIONS AND SINKS. AS I'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR REMAINS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS AND KNOCKS THE MISSIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA'S GHG EMISSIONS WERE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT. TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA GHG EMISSIONS AT 41% OF THE TOTAL. AND TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE OVER 50% WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR THE PORTION OF INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS RELATED TO FUEL PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS ALSO THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF THE NITROGEN OXIDES ARE KNOCKS EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OZONE AND PARTICULATE AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS. WITH APPROXIMATELY 80% COMING FROM THE SECTOR AS A WHOLE. IN PARTICULAR THIS IS DOMINATED BY THE HEAVY TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BUSES FREIGHT EQUIPMENT LOCOMOTIVES MARINE VESSELS AND OTHER OFFERED EQUIPMENT ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 60% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL KNOCKS EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER MAKES UP 30% OF ALL PARTICULAR MATTER EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. UNLIKE OTHER PARTICULATE MATTER INCLUDED IN THE PARAGRAPH DIESEL PM IS NOT A CRITERIA POLLUTANT BUT RATHER A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. MOVING ON TO THE SCOPING PLAN UPDATE. THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN WILL ASSESS PROGRESS TO ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. AND WILL EVALUATE HOW TO PUT OURSELVES ON A PATH THAT ULTIMATELY ACHIEVES CARBON NEUTRALITY. ON THIS GRAPHIC WE'RE SHOWING OUR HISTORICAL EMISSIONS TRENDS FOR THE ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN COMPARISON TO BOTH OUR PREVIOUS TWENTY TWENTY TARGET AN UPCOMING TWENTY THIRTY TARGET A 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY. ON THE FAR RIGHT WE ALSO SHOW THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE EXECUTIVE ORDER TOTAL OF 80% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY FIFTY. IF WE ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND MAINTAIN THAT RATE REDUCTIONS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE 80% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY FORTY. TWENTY THIRTY IS AN EMISSIONS TARGET BUT IT IS ALSO A MILESTONE ON THE WAY TO ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATION REQUIRED TO HIT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID CENTURY MEANS THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE ACTIONS IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN STRANDED ACCESS AFTER TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE'RE A LONGER POLICY SIGNAL IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR ACTION AND INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. SCOPING PLANS ARE IN OUR ACTIONABLE PLANS TO LAY OUT A COST EFFECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGY FEASIBLE PATH TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET THE STATEWIDE GHG REDUCTION TARGETS. IT SCOPING PLAN HAS INCLUDED SWEET OF POLICIES TO ACHIEVE BROAD MANDATES AND HAS NEVER RELIED ON ONE APPROACH TO ACHIEVING EMISSIONS THEY EACH HAVE A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES REGULATIONS AND CARBON PRICING. THE PLAN IS ECONOMY WIDE AND SPANS MANY YEARS AS SUCH IT DOES NOT GO INTO THE DESIGN DETAILS OF ANY PROGRAM OR REGULATION. NOR DOES IT SUPPLANT OR CREATE NEW STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. THIS IS OUR FOURTH SCOPING PLAN UPDATE AT A MINIMUM EACH PLAN LEVERAGES TRADITIONAL AIR QUALITY POLICIES TO PROVIDE BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE FOR LEAKAGE WHICH IS WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND JOBS LEAVES THE STATE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE REDUCE EMISSIONS BUT THEY WERE MERELY MOVED OUT OF OUR INVENTORY. FINALLY AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES US TO FACILITATE SUBNATIONAL AND NATIONAL COLLABORATION AND THAT POLICIES BE COST EFFECTIVE AND FLEXIBLE WITH COMPLIANCE. THIS IS CRITICAL AS CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS 1% OF GLOBAL GHG EMISSIONS. WE CANNOT SOLVE THIS GLOBAL ISSUE WITHOUT ACTION FROM LIKE MINDED PARTNERS WE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. FOR GLOBAL POLLUTANTS SUCH AS GREENHOUSE GASES A REDUCTION ANYWHERE IS A BENEFIT EVERYWHERE WHICH THUS PROVIDES A DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO THE STATE. OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DEVELOP SCALABLE AND EXPORTABLE PROGRAMS THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN IMPLEMENT AND USE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS WITH IN OUR WITHIN THEIR BORDERS. THIS IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESSING THIS GLOBAL THREAT. AS MENTIONED DIRECTION ON SCOPING PLAN GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE INFORMED BY STATE STATUTES AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS AFTER EACH PLAN IS ADOPTED CARBON OTHER STATE AGENCIES START THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING AND UPDATING REGULAR RELATED PROGRAMS FOR DEVELOPING NEW PROGRAMS TO ALIGN ANY OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED IN THE SKIPPING PLAN. ALIGNING THESE PROGRAMS RELIES ON MULTIPLE DIVISIONS ACROSS CARBON OTHER STATE AGENCIES TAKING ACTIONS ON THEIR BASED ON THEIR ESTABLISH ROLES AND AUTHORITY. FOR CARD THAT MEANS WE BRING FORTH DOZENS OF REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS TO THE BOARD TO APPROVE WHICH WILL HELP IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. EACH OF THESE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PUBLIC PROCESS AND DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND THAT MEANS THAT SOME REGULATIONS CAN TAKE A FEW YEARS TO DEVELOP THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS BEFORE GOING TO THE BOARD FOR ADOPTION. AND FOLLOW THE REST OF THE REQUIRED REGULATORY STEPS INVOLVED IN OBTAINING APPROVAL BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND FILING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. OUR LAST COPING PLAN ADOPTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT LAID OUT A PATH TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. IT INCLUDES ACTIONS ON EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AND IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY ALTERNATIVE MOBILITY OPTIONS. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SLASHING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. IMPORTANTLY IT HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR GHG TARGETS. AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE DOWN HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. KEEP PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAVE DOUBLED IN STRINGENCY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR TO REFLECT THE STEEPER RATE REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THESE PROGRAMS DOES NOT REFLECT THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE UNDER THE INCREASED STRINGENCY ESTABLISHED FOR THIS DECADE. VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS THE LEGISLATURE AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO SEND STEADY AND UNWAVERING POLICY SIGNALS THAT WE WANT TO REDUCE GHGS AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE IN THE SECOND DECADE OF TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE ARE SEEING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD HOPED FOR. WE KNOW CLIMATE ACTION CAN CREATE AND KEEP HIGH ROAD JOBS AS SUCH AS IN OUR CLEAN TECH SECTORS. WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND INCREASED INVESTOR INTEREST IN CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO REFINERIES THAT HAVE STATED THEY WILL STOP PRODUCING CONVENTIONAL DIESEL AND INSTEAD PRODUCE RENEWABLE DIESEL. BROUGH DURABLE DIESEL PRODUCES 30% LESS DIESEL PM WHICH IS A CANCER CAUSING POLLUTANTS THAT CONCENTRATES NEAR FREEWAYS. BENEFITING HEAVILY BURDENED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OFTEN A ADJACENT. IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER RENEWABLE DIESEL MADE UP 225% OF CALIFORNIANS DIESEL SUPPLY. THE CRITICAL ISSUE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OUR EXTENDED TIMELINES FOR PERMIT APPROVALS AND RECONFIGURATION OF THESE FACILITIES TO PRODUCE THIS LOWER CARBON ENERGY. PERMITTING ISSUES ARE ALSO KEY FOR CITING COMPOSTING FACILITIES WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM ORGANIC WASTE. AS WELL AS MOVING FORWARD WITH TRANSITIONING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WILL KEEP JOBS IN THE REGION AND FOSTER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ACHIEVING SUCCESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS WE MUST MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO THE GREEN TRANSITION OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE BUILD OUT OF NEW CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EXECUTION OF THE SCOPING PLAN. RELIES ON A THIRTY AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THE OVERLAY OF CARBON NEUTRALITY IN OUR LONG TERM CLIMATE PLANNING NEEDS WE NEED TO REDEFINE OUR SCOPE OF SOURCES AND SINKS IN THAT FRAMEWORK IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO PLAN. CARBON NEUTRALITY ISACHIEVED WHEN HE MISSION SOURCES EQUAL SYNCS. UP UNTIL NOW EVERY SCOPING PLAN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL FOCUS SOURCES AS REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT AS OUR GOALS HAVE GROWN TO INCLUDE CARBON NEUTRALITY WE HAVE EXPANDED THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE ALL SOURCES WHICH MEANS THE EMISSIONS FROM THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AND ALL CARBON SINKS. THE CIRCLE ON THE LEFT REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM AB THIRTY TWO INVENTORY SOURCES WHICH WE CAN WHILE WE CONTINUE TO RATCHET DOWN THROUGH AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE POLICY. CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO LARGE EMITTERS OF CARBON DIOXIDE TO THE MEANT TO MITIGATE EMISSIONS. NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CAN BE A NET GHG SOURCE OR SINK AS INDICATED BY THE PLUS AND MINUS ASIDE. IN THE STATE SEPARATE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS INVENTORY WILL ALLOW US TO TRACK THE GHG EMISSIONS AND SEEK RESTORATION ON NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS OVER TIME. AND BEYOND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL OPTIONS SUCH AS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE. COUPLED WITH PERMANENT UNDERGROUND STORAGE OF CO TWO THAT CAN REMOVE EMISSIONS FROM AMBIENT AIR. ONCE WE HAVE A SENSE OF GHG EMISSION MITIGATION FROM OUR SOURCES AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS WE CAN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO COMPENSATE FOR REMAINING EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO. ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE MODEL FOR ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY SOURCES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FOR MOBILE AND STATIONARY SOURCES THAT MAY BE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE. EACH OF THE FOUR ALTERNATIVES EXCEEDS THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET OF REDUCING EMISSIONS 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. ALTERNATIVE ONE NEARLY PHASES OUT FOSSIL AND BIOMASS CONFESSION COMPLETELY TOWARD ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AMBITIOUS INNOVATION IN ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY AS THE PRIMARY NON COMBUSTION OF FOSSIL FUEL ALTERNATIVE. AND IT REQUIRES EARLY AMBITIOUS RETIREMENT VEHICLES AND GAS APPLIANCES IN BUILDINGS TO PHASE OUT COMBUSTION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE FULL SUITE OF TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING ENGINEERED CARBON REMOVAL AT A RAPID PACE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TOWARDS ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS CONTINUES BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. ALTERNATIVE THREE USES A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF EXISTING AND EMERGING FOSSIL FUEL ALTERNATIVES. IT INCLUDES ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR SAID EXECUTIVE ORDER ELIMINATING INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES THROUGHOUT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TOWARD ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE LONGER TIME FRAME INCLUDES END OF LIFE TRANSITION OF VEHICLES AND GAS APPLIANCES. ALTERNATIVE FOR IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES NOT REACH THE TWENTY FIFTY TARGET OF REDUCING EMISSIONS 80% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. THIS ALTERNATIVE HAS THE SLOWEST PACE OF TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. WHAT ALL FOUR ALTERNATIVES DRASTICALLY REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. GHG EMISSIONS DO REMAIN IN EVERY ALTERNATIVE. ALTERNATIVE THREE IS CRAFTED MOVED TO MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH EXISTING LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND THEREFORE CARDS STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE THREE. THE BOARD WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH I ON ALL OF THESE ALTERNATIVES IN THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN. AS IT COMES TO THE BOARD IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. THE MODELING RESULTS SHOW THAT EVEN AFTER WE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS THERE WILL BE RESIDUAL EMISSIONS IN ALL FOUR ALTERNATIVES AS I NOTED BEFORE. THE EMISSIONS ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH METHANE IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR. COMBUSTION ENGINE EMISSIONS REMAINING IN THE ELECTRICITY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS TRANSPORTATION FUELS TO MEET REMAINING DEMAND FROM EXISTING. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES AND HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL HYDROFORMED CARBONS OR HSCS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY THESE RESIDUAL EMISSIONS MUST. BE COMPENSATED BY CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS. TO BE CLEAR WE ARE MODELING SCENARIOS THAT FIRST PUSH ON CLEAN FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY. AND CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IS TO ADDRESS RESIDUAL EMISSIONS. THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES TO CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGICAL CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL. WE'VE CONDUCTED DETAILED MODELLING OF OUR NATURAL THE WORKING LANDS WHICH I'LL DISCUSS NEXT BUT WE DO FIND THAT BOTH NATURE BASED AND TECHNOLOGICAL CARBON DIOXIDE APPROACHES WILL BE NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE'S LANDS FOR A CLIMATE EFFORTS GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DIRECTING CARD TO INCLUDED TARGET FOR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IN SUPPORT OF CARBON NEUTRALITY AS PART OF THE SCOPING PLAN. WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE MOST ADVANCED MODELING FOR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS TO DATE. THIS IS GROUND BREAKING WORK AND THE FIRST TIME THIS LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY ANY GOVERNMENT FOR IDENTIFYING CARBON TARGETS AND CLIMATE GOALS. HARDSTAFF CONDUCTED A META ANALYSIS AND LITERATURE REVIEW TO CATALOG AND QUANTIFY. WHAT PREVIOUS RESEARCH CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CARBON. THIS GRAPH SHOWS THECOMBINED RESULTS FROM CARBS SKIPPING PLAN MODELING LAID ON TOP OF THE RESULTS FROM THIS META ANALYSIS AND ALONGSIDE THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS INVENTORY TREND LINE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH INDICATES A PROBABLE DECREASE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION INTO THE FUTURE. THE CARD NATURAL THE WORKING MAN'S CARBON INVENTORY INDICATES WE ARE CURRENTLY ON THE LOW END OF THAT TRAJECTORY. CARB SCOPING PLAN MODELING IS IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH INDICATING A POSSIBLE DECREASE IN CARBON STOCKS GOING INTO THE FUTURE. EVEN THOUGH NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS MODELING INDICATE DECREASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IMPORTANTLY THE MODELING ALSO SHOWS THAT MANAGEMENT CAN INCREASE CARBON STOCKS FROM THE BUSINESS AS USUAL TRAJECTORY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FROM LANDS AND IMPROVE ECOSYSTEM IN PUBLIC HEALTH. WE ALSO KNOW THAT UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ABOUT FUTURE CLIMATE AND THE IMPACTS OF CHANGING CLIMATE MAY HAVE ON OUR ECOSYSTEMS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE TAKE DECISIVE AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION. TO IMPROVE AND DIVERSIFY ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURES AND MANAGEMENT. THE MODELING AND COLLABORATIVE WORK WE HAVE DONE WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. ACTIONS TO ENSURE THAT OUR ECOSYSTEMS ARE EQUIPPED TO WITHSTAND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT BOTH NATURE AND SOCIETY DEPEND ON. FOR SURVIVAL. THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES TO THE DATA AND METRICS FOR THE SCOPING PLAN AS REQUIRED UNDER AB ONE NINETY SEVEN WE WILL BE INCLUDING THE COST PER TON OF MEASURE. THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AN ESTIMATED AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. IN THIS UPDATE WE EXPAND ON PRIOR WORK TO DEVELOP A MORE EXTENSIVE. HEALTH ANALYSIS INCLUDING MORE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. ONE KEY WAY WE ARE EXPANDING OUR HEALTH ANALYSIS IS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HEALTH ENDPOINTS I IMMEDIATE PLANS INCLUDING EXPANDING OUR HEALTH AND ENDPOINTS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL RESPIRATORY AND DISEASE OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO THE QUANTITATIVE TOOLS THE QUALITATIVE TOOLS PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEYOND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS WE CAN LOOK AT A BROADER RANGE OF BENEFITS AND IMPACTS ESPECIALLY ACROSS COMMUNITIES AND GROUPS. WE WILL USE BOTH THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS TOGETHER TO COVER THE BROAD RANGE OF BENEFITS. ARE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT CAN LOOK AT DIRECTIONAL EFFECTS AND THE SCALE OF IMPACTS AND BENEFITS AND WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK MORE CLEARLY AT COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY AND THE EFFECTS OF DISPARITIES I'D RE IN RESOURCES HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. AND WE CAN LOOK AT HOW THE GOALS OF THE SCRUBBING PLAN OUTCOMES WILL IMPROVE HEALTH IN COMMUNITIES AND ASSIST IN THE MOVE TOWARD MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS A STATE WIDE ANALYSIS THAT WILL INFORM POTENTIAL COMMUNITY IMPACTS NOT A COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY ANALYSIS. AND LASTLY OF COURSE WE WILL BE DOING A SEQUEL AND ALICE'S AS PART OF THIS WORK. WE'RE PLANNING TO RELEASE THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN IN MAY AT THAT TIME WE WILL RELEASE THE UNDERLYING MODELING DATA FOR THE EMISSIONS ECONOMIC AN AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS. WHICH ARE UNDERGOING FINAL QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKS BY STAFF. ONE PIECE WE PLAN TO INCLUDE IS AN UPDATED ESTIMATE ON THE ROLE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. OUR INITIAL MODELING THAT IS GOING THROUGH THAT REVIEW SHOWS IT WILL HAVE A POTENTIALLY SMALLER ROLE TO PLAY DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS- STARTING AT A LOWER EMISSIONS. FOR THIS DECADE THAN MODELED FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN. AS WE COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE PANDEMIC BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THERE'S BEEN KEY AREAS WHERE WE ULTIMATELY RECEIVED GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION SUCH AS THIS AB EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SB ONE HUNDRED. WHICH CALLED FOR MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION ON DAD'S AND CLEAN ENERGY BEYOND WHAT WE MODELED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND WHEN CARP UPDATED THE L. CFS REGULATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CARBON INTENSITY AND WAS ADOPTED. AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN IT WAS MODELED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SKIPPING PLAN. ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW THAT REDUCTIONS FROM SOME OTHER POLICIES SUCH AS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ARE NOT BEING REALIZED AS MODELED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE RATE OF PERMITTING AND DEPLOYMENT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AND DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY. THE ROLE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WOULD BE FURTHER REDUCED AS ANY NEW TARGETED MEASURES ARE INTRODUCED OVER THIS DECADE. AS I MENTIONED AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THAT THE SCRUBBING PLAN BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS SO WE NEED TO BRING THE PLAN BEFORE THE BOARD FOR ADOPTION BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TO. THE TIMELINE HERE DEPICTS THE MAJOR MILESTONES IN THIS PROCESS. AS I MENTIONED WILL BE RELEASING THE DRAFT IN MAY AND IT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE BOARD FOR INITIAL COMMENTS IN JUNE. AFTER THAT RELEASED THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE THROUGH SCOPING PLAN WORKSHOPS ON SPECIFIC TOPICS. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS BEING PLANNED FOR THIS SUMMER AND ON GOING. THROUGH THE FIVE. AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THAT PROCESS WE WILL FOLLOW WITH THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL SCOPING PLAN IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. POSTDOCS IN BY THE BOARD AT A BOARD MEETING BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS LED JUST DETAILS THE REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT THAT EXIST FOR CARBS PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR ANNUAL UPDATES TO OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GAS INVENTORY AND MANDATORY REPORTING. STATUS UPDATES ON THE SCOPING PLANNING KEEP CLIMATE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS REPORTS BY THE IP MAC AND THE L. A. M. THE FOLLOWING SLIDE INCLUDES LINKS FOR INFORMATION FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY THE SCOPING PLAN AND OUR WORKSHOPS. BUT OF COURSE THE MOST VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN THESE REPORTS BUT RATHER IN OUR DIRECT INTERACTIONS. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH SOME OF YOU ALREADY TO DISCUSS OUR WORK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE COMING YEARS AS WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND REDUCE THE BURDENS OF AIR POLLUTION ON ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST IMPACTED. LAST YEAR AT HIS PRESENTATION I STATED THAT BOLD ACTION WAS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE TRANSPORTATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND THE ENERGY SOURCE IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND CONTINUE TO MODEL TO THE WORLD HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL CRISIS. AS THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES THEIR FORWARD THINKING WE NEED TO THINK NOT JUST ABOUT OUR TRANSFORMATIVE VISION AS A STATE BUT THE NUTS AND BOLTS ABOUT OF HOW WE TURN THAT VISION INTO REALITY. WE KNOW WE OF RAN OUT OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT AND THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OF CLIMATE POLICY WILL REQUIRE NOT JUST BOLD VISION. BUT HE DETERMINATION TO HAVE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT OUR PROCESS SEES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SERVE STATE GOALS AND FOCUS ON THE NITTY GRITTY BUSINESS OF MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT TO PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CHAIR AROUND UGH- AREA. THOROUGH AND INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE TO- ALL THAT YOU SHARED WITH LIKE TO WORK- TAKE ALL THREE SPEAKERS BEFORE WE OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A QUESTIONS AND SO- CHAIR RAND OFF WE APPRECIATE TO WE KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY SCHEDULE- BUT- WE WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD- STAY FOR THE EVENT THAT THE QUESTIONS. SO I WITHOUT TO ANY FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE NEXT SPEAKER WHICH IS- DALLAS PER TRIAL THE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE- CHAIR BIRCHALL. WELCOME. THANK YOU TURN COMMITTEE FOR HOME INVITING US THE TESTIFIED TODAY ON BEHALF OF AMERICA AMERICA'S CREATED UNDER EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN A OR B. ON THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPLIANCE MARKETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS I WANT TO START WITH SOME GOOD NEWS. ON SATURDAY OF THIS WEEK THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WILL PUBLISH A REGULATION OUGHT TO INDICATE ITS JOINING OF THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE A COALITION OF ELEVEN LINKED A STATES IN THE NORTHEAST AND MID ATLANTIC R. THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT IN JULY OF THIS YEAR IT WILL OF VIRTUALLY DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE. AND SO I THINK THAT IS A POINT DEPARTURE BECAUSE I'M HERE AS AN ADVOCATE BUT ALSO A CRITICAL ANALYST ABOUT THE ROLE OF CARBON MARKETS AND HOW THEY FIT INTO THE COMPREHENSIVE. CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO IN THE STATE. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF CARBON MARKETS SO- SOME OF WHICH ARTICULATED BY THE BIBLE JUSTICE ADVOCATE. ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE PROGRESS. AT THE SAME TIME I LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. OF PUTTING A PRICE ON POLLUTION CONTRAST SHARPLY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL WAY THAT INDUSTRIAL LICENCES TO POLLUTE WERE ISSUED BY STATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH WAS TO GIVE THOSE AND LICENSE TO POLLUTE AWAY FOR FREE. I PUTTING A PRICE ON CARBON. LOOTERS HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A COST TO THE POLLUTION AND DEBATE GOING TOWARD HER THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO TRY TO AVOID THE POLLUTION EVEN WHEN ALLOWANCES ARE GIVEN AWAY FOR FREE TO INDUSTRY THERE REMAINS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION. NOW WE SHOULD REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH FREE ALLOCATION THIS CALL FOR AND I'M GONNA HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT. THE THIRD COMPLIANCE PERIOD JUST FINISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY. WITH A 100% COMPLIANCE. THIS SUCCESS PROVIDES A SOLID PLATFORM. FOR REFORMS. THAT WERE BEGUN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UP FOR THIS NEW COMPLAINTS BREED AND I THINK ALSO FURTHER. REFORMS THAT WERE GOING TO DISCUSS NOW THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY I. MAK FOR THE- CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I DON'T START BY FRAMING THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCOPING PLAN. I AM. THE ARBY'S BIGGEST FAN. BOTH INSIDE THE STADIUM WHEN I SPEAK TO FOLKS OUTSIDE THE STATE AS IT IS THE LEADING TECHNICAL AGENCY IN THE WORLD. ON AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND- AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOK TO THE A. R. B. FOR ITS TECHNICAL GUIDANCE. AND I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS WHICH IS. REALLY BEGINS BY IDENTIFYING THE TECHNOLOGICAL PATHWAYS THE SEED WAY DOWN THE ROAD ON WHERE WE- NEED TO GO. UP THE IMAX CONCERNS ARE INCREASINGLY TO MARRY THAT WITH A PERFORMANCE ACCORDING TO THE MILESTONES THAT CHARITABLE. ENGINE AND THE COMMITTEE ASKED FOR GREATER CLARITY ABOUT WHAT THE STATE WILL DO TO HIT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL AND WE WOULD DESCRIBE THIS IS ALMOST AN ADDITIONAL SCENARIO TO THE ONES ARE BEING MODELED. FOR SOME TYPES OF ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ARE MEASURES TAKE EFFECT WHERE ARE WE WHAT IS THE PROJECT ALL RIGHT NOW. IN THE COMMITTEE US FOR GREATER CLARITY ABOUT THE ROLE OF COPPER TRADING CHORE AND ALSO THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT. IN THE FUTURE. ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS ABOUT THE CARPENTRY PROGRAM IS THE ROLE OF THE ALLOWANCE BANK. THE THERE ARE BEES ARE ASSESSMENT AT THE ENDOF THE THIRD COMPLIANCE PERIOD VALIDATED THE CALCULATIONS BY THE I'M OUT. THE DOOR OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION. ALLOWANCES SUPPORT EQUABLE THE TONS. RESIDING AT PRIVATE ACCOUNTS EVEN AFTER AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE- ON TERRY ALLOWANCES. AND FURTHERMORE THERE ARE NEARLY AS MANY ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTS THE COULD REENTER THE PROGRAM UNDER CERTAIN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PRIVATELY BANKS ALLOWANCES ALONE OR GREATER THAN ONE YEAR ANNUAL ISSUANCE OF NEW ALLOWANCES UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THIS IS A VERY SIZABLE BANK. AND IT'S GREATER THAN THE PROJECTIVE CUMULATIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS BY SOURCES COVERED BY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM UNDER THAT UNDER THE CAP THREE TWENTY THIRTY. IF THERE'S THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE CORRECT 4% PER YEAR. SO THE RESOLUTION OF THE ALLOW ITS SUPPLY INCLUDING THE BANK WILL DETERMINE THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE ACHIEVED BY COVEREDSOURCES. THE MARKET COVERS ONLY 75% OF TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. AND IF EMISSION REDUCTIONS AT THESE SOURCES COVERED BY THE CAP DON'T KEEP UP IT'S MEANS THAT WE WILL NOT THIS NECESSITATED GREATER LEVEL OF MISTER REDUCTIONS THAT SOURCES OUTSIDE THE COPS INCLUDING NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. END INEVITABLY GREATER REGULATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. OF THE COMMITTEE ASKS A OR B. TO DEVELOP ANNUAL. VISIBLE ANNUAL METRICS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BANK SO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC CAN OBSERVE THE ROLE CAP AND TRADE AND TRY TO CONTRIBUTE CONSTRUCTIVELY TO SING THE OVERALL GOALS ARE ACHIEVED IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY WE THINK THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CONTRIBUTES IMPORTANTLY. TO THAT OUTCOME. SO WITH THIS LOT LOT SIZEABLE LOANS BANK BEFORE US THE COMMITTEE HOUSE OF STUDY POTENTIAL APPROACHES TO REFORMING THE MARKET THE DEAL WITH THE EXISTING ALONE SPENT. WE THINK REDUCING ALLOW SUPPLY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD USING ITS AUTHORITY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE AND THAT IT HAS PREVIOUSLY USED THE SUB LEVEL THE PRICE FLOOR AND THE CEILING. IMPORTANTLY POLICY MEMBERS MIGHT WANT POLICYMAKERS MIGHT WANT TO ENSURE THAT REFORMS TO REDUCE ALLOWED SUPPLY DOES NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. WHICH ENABLE NUMEROUS CLIMATE RELATED INVESTMENTS OVER HALF OF THESE ABOUT A INVESTMENTS ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND US FOR EXAMPLE THE DRAFT E. JOCKS SCOPING PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS POINT OUT. NO ONE RECOGNIZES THE URGENCY OF OUR CLIMATE CRISIS MORE THAN FRONTLINE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS THOSE VIDAK RECOMMENDATIONS LIST MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANDED INVESTMENT IN AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. FOR THE EIMAC REPORT MAKES SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADJUST THE LEVEL SUPPLY WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING OR INCREASING REVENUE TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND A KEY IDEA IS THIS. THAT IF ONLY STATE OWNED AUCTION ALLOWED SUPPLIES ARE REDUCED THE REVENUES THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WOULDN'T EVIDENTLY FALL. TO AVOID THIS REDUCTION IN REVENUE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND EACH SOURCE OF SUPPLY THAT IS ABOUT HALF THE ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED FOR FREE TO UTILITIES AND INDUSTRIAL ENTITIES AND HALF THAT ARE SOLD THROUGH THE AUCTION EACH SOURCE OF ALLOW SUPPLY NEEDS TO BE REDUCED PROPORTIONALLY. I BELIEVE THIS CAN BE DONE UNDER A ABUSE AUTHORITY TO ADJUST OVERALL LOANS COUNT. THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIES TWO WAYS THAT ALLOW SUPPLY CAN BE REDUCED ONE IS A SO THE FIRST THAT WOULD MIGHT OCCUR TO YOU IT'S A IT'S A DIRECT APPROACH ADDRESS CUMULATIVE SUPPLY BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES ARE ISSUED EACH YEAR GOING FORWARD. THIS TYPE OF MARKET REFORM HAS BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TWICE IN THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE. TO GOOD EFFECT. A SECOND APPROACH TO MARK EFORM WOULD BE TO ADD FURTHER STRUCTURE TO THE MARKET BY MAKING THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE PRICE OF ALLOWANCES. ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE PRICE FOR. PERHAPS A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO ADD ADDITIONAL PRICE STEPS IN THE ALLOWED SUPPLY FORMULA. REGGIE DID THIS IT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL PRICE STEP CALLED THE EMISSIONS CONTAINERS URBAN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WASHINGTON STATE INTENDS TO DO THIS AND DEVELOPING REGULATIONS FOR THEIR PROGRAM. THIS APPROACH COULD CHANGE ALLOWED SUPPLY INCREMENTALLY BY HARVESTING ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS ONE ALLOWANCE PRICES ARE LOW. AND THIS APPROACH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DONE EXCLUSIVE OTHER REFORMS BUT IT IS ONE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET WORK MORE ROBUST TO THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT ONE CANNOT ANTICIPATE GOING FORWARD BUT WORK FOR WHICH MARKETS PERFORM SO WELL. WHEN THEY'RE SET UP PROPERLY. THE COMMITTEE HAD TWO OTHER COMMENTS ON TO OTHER INSURANCE. ONE IS OFFSETS OFFSETS EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ALLOWED SUPPLY BECAUSE ALSO TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENT THAT IS ADDITIONAL TO THE CUP. FORCE CONSTITUTE ABOUT 80% OF ALL OF OFFICE SUPPLY GOODS CONCERN CONTINUES ABOUT THE PERMANENCE OF THIS. MITIGATION MEASURE THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFY POTENTIAL REFORMS HERE TO AND ONE OF THEM THAT IS A COMPELLING IT IS TO ASSESS EMISSIONS CHANGES THE STRUCTURE WITH OFFSETS EX POST AND IT JUST ALLOWED SUPPLY ACCORDINGLY IF THERE IS OF THE FAILURE OF THE OFFSETS TO. ACHIEVE MITIGATION GOALS THIS WOULD HELP WOULD ADDRESS THE OVERHANG OF A OF ALLOWANCES- THAT AND VETERAN SUPPLY AND ALSO MAY. UP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY OF STRUCTURE WITH WHETHER OR NOT OF THE FIRST OFFSET IS ACHIEVING ITS MITIGATION GOALS. THE OTHER AREA IS LEAKAGE AND THIS HAS COME UP ALREADY TODAY REALLOCATION TO INDUSTRY IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE THE LEAKAGE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND ADMISSIONS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT REGULATE CARBON. RELOCATION HOUSING OPPORTUNITY COST. RELOCATION SUBTRACTS FROM OTHER USES ALLOWED VALUE THE MIGHT. BE DIRECTED TO TECHNOLOGY. INFASTRUCTURE AFFORDABILITY OR INVESTMENTS THOSE ARE DESCRIBED AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE INFORMATION ON WHICH FREE ALLOCATION IS BASED IS OUT OF DATE AND IT SHOULD BE UPDATED THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED THIS THIS INFORMATION IS UPDATED AND REEVALUATED. UP WE'VE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER OF SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT THAT I KNOW THAT IT'LL BE STAFF HAVE LOOKED OUT AND WE INVITE YOUR LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO LOOK OUT AND WE'D BE VERY PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY. MAKING THIS POINT EVEN RECOMMENDING CHANGES IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW CHANGES OCCUR MARKETS DO NOT WORK WELL WHEN THERE'S PERVASIVE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND AS AN ADVOCATE OF AN ANALYST FOR THE CURRENT MARKET WORK IN SWEDEN ONE MIGHT BE CONCERNED THAT ONE MARKET SURPRISE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION THE MARKET. US SUGGESTED ANOTHER MARKETS PRICE MIGHT BE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AND THAT THE PUBLIC IS REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THAT UNDERMINES INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT AT LEAST AS MOTIVATED BY THE MARKETS ARE REDUCES THE INFLUENCE OF THE MARKET WHICH WE THINK IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE CHANNEL AND ACHIEVING THE STATE'S OVERALL EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. HENCE WE POINT TO THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT CAN BE FOUND FOR RULE BASED ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS PRICE STEPS TO CONTROL ALLOW SUPPLY THAT'S ESPECIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE THEY TAKE EFFECT AUTOMATICALLY TO CORRECT THE MARKET AS THE MARKET MOVES FORWARD. POTENTIAL POTENTIAL CHANGES SHOULD UNFOLD WITHIN THE DELIBERATE OF MOLDING AND REGULATORY PROCESSES WERE OBSERVING NOW WITH THE SCOPING PLAN. IN WHICH AND SO THAT THOSE CHANGES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED A THOUGHTFUL BUT ALSO TIMELY WAY SO SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SCOPING PLAN CULMINATE. IN REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE REGULATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FURTHER GUIDANCE FOR THE CORPORATE MARKET. THANK YOU REPORTER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- EACH EVER TRIAL AND- A YES WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT- IF- YOU CONDEMN TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL A LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST WE HAVE DOCTOR CATHERINE GROUP A WHITE A MEMBER OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE- DOCTOR GROUP WHITE WELCOME. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MURATSUCHI AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS DR CATHERINE GROUP A WHITE OR DOCTOR CATHERINE AS EACH TRACK MEMBERS LIKE TO CALL ME. I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS C. BACK HAS WORKED TO RESTORE CLEAN AIR TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ACROSS THE EIGHT COUNTY REGION SPANNING FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY IN THE NORTH TO KERN COUNTY IN THE SOUTH. WORKING WITHIN UNSEEDED YOUR CUTS AND MIWOK LANCE. WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE THE MOST POLLUTED AIR BASIN IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES FOR FINE PARTICLES ONE OF THE MOST MOST POLLUTED FOR OZONE AND AS SUCH OUR REGION SUFFERS EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF SICKNESS EVEN PRE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED ALONG WITH CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE FUELED WILDFIRES LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND MANY OTHER INTERSECTIONAL ISSUES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES SUFFER WITH. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT AND DOING THIS WORK ARE THE STORIES OF PARENTS HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN WHILE THEY TURN BLUE HAVING TO RUSH THEM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR TREATMENT FOR BREATHING PROBLEMS. QUESTIONING IF THEY CAN LET THEIR KIDS SAFELY PLAY OUTSIDE. STORIES OF LOVED ONES WHO HAVE DIED TOO SOON THAT STICK WITH YOU. I AM INSPIRED BY THE PASSION INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND WISDOM OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND BEYOND. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE WE ARE NOT A MONOLITH SO I'M NOT HERE TO SPEAK FOR EVERYONE. OR EVERY SECTOR OF THE EGM MOVEMENT BUT ONLY OUR PERSPECTIVE. IN MANY WAYS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS GROUND ZERO FOR CLIMATE IMPACTS BECAUSE OF OUR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS. HISTORICALLY WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE OIL FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES. WHERE THE MOST AGRICULTURALLY PRODUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE REGION THAT HAS EVER EXISTED IN HUMANKIND. NOT TO MENTION GROWING SPRAWL BEDROOM COMMUNITIES ON HOUSE FOLKS. GOODS MOVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE GIANT SECTORS HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AND AN OVER RELIANCE ON MODELS AND PLANS WITH OF RELIANCE ON INCENTIVES CLEARLY IS NOT WORKING TO MEET CLEAN AIR GOALS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. ONE OF THE MANY HATS I WEAR ALONG WITH BEING THE DIRECTOR OF C. BACK AND A PARENT IS I'M ALSO PART TIME FACULTY IN GEOGRAPHY AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES TO TEACH IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA GEOGRAPHY BECAUSE I GET TO CELEBRATE. THE PHYSICAL AND CULTURAL ABUNDANCE OF OUR STATE AND HOW IMPRESSIVE WE ARE. WE ARE TRULY A LAND OF BIG THINGS WITH THE OLDEST LIVING TREES AND THE BRISTLECONE PINE THE OLDEST LIVING PLANT IN THE CREOSOTE BUSH. THE TALLEST LIVING THINGS ON EARTH IN THE COAST REDWOODS THE LARGEST LIVING TREES IN THE GIANT SEQUOIAS. FROM HOLLYWOOD HUMBOLDT FROM YOU SOMEBODY TO THE COLORADO DESERT. WE ALSO HAVE RICH CULTURAL DIVERSITY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BEING HOME TO THE FARMWORKER MOVEMENT AMONG MANY OTHER CULTURAL ASPECTS THAT WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE AND BE PROUD OF. IT'S ALSO JUXTAPOSED WITH VOTE THE COST OF. PRODUCING THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE LARGEST HUMAN ALTERATIONS TO OUR WATER WAYS. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS THE LARGEST ALTERATION OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HUMANKIND DUE TO MINING GROUND WATER FOR AGRICULTURE. SO WHILE WE ARE THE FIRST FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES. SO AGAIN THESE BENEFITS ARE COMING AT A VERY HIGH COST AND THE COST CLEARLY ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S GEOGRAPHY IS WIDELY VARIABLE CULTURALLY AND PHYSICALLY OUR ROUTE PROBLEMS REMAIN THE SAME. RACISM EXPLOITATION AND EXTRACTION. WE KNOW THE TO MEET CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON DIRECT REDUCTIONS. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD'S ORIGINAL CHARGE IS TO MEET CLEAN AIR GOALS AND WHILE THEY'RE HAILED AS A LEADER IN MANY ASPECTS CLEARLY FOR CLEAN AIR WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. WE DO CELEBRATE ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THE GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CARBS COMMITMENTS ON CARS AND TRUCKS AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE HIGH COMPLIANCE RATES THAT AND ENFORCEMENT REPORTS SHOW. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO PLACE THOSE NEXT TWO BROKEN PROCESSES WITH OUR AREA AGENCIES THAT RESULT IN A MISUSE OF MONEY AND POWER THERE ARE NUMEROUS LAWSUITS REGARDING FIELD PLANTS THAT I COULD POINT TO BUT INSTEAD I WANT TO USE TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROCESSES THAT I PARTICIPATE IN. THAT I THINK EXHIBIT OUR OVER RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND INCENTIVES THAT CONTINUED TO WIDEN AND DEEPEN DISPARITIES AND IMPACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. SO FOR ONE I SERVE ON THE STOCKTON STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE COMMUNITY- PROTECTION PROGRAMMER AB SIX ONE SEVEN WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A VISIONARY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGED PARTICIPATORY PROCESS THAT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE EXPERIENCE. AS MANAGED BY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR DISTRICT AS AN ONGOING DEBATE OVER HOW TO INVEST DOLLARS AN EQUITABLE WAYS WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PUNITIVELY REMOVED FROM THE COMMUNITIES BUDGET. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T VOTE FOR MEASURES THAT THE AIR DISTRICT WANTED THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF POLLUTION IN THE AREA OUT WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY OR OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS THAT WERE REQUESTED BY THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE. THAT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY MEMBERS SPEAKING THEIR PRIORITIES AND BEING PUNISHED FOR IT. I ALSO FOR MANY YEARS HAVE WORK IN WORKS TO REPAIR THE BROKEN EMISSION REDUCTION CREDIT PROGRAM MANAGED BY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OR DISTRICT WHICH IN SOME WAYS IS A PARALLEL TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS. THE FAILURES OF THE SYSTEM DEMONSTRATE DEEP CORRUPTION IN OFFSETTING SYSTEMS AND NOT COINCIDENTLY HAS FAVORED THE OIL INDUSTRY AND DESPITE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD U. S. EPA AND THE AIR DISTRICT AGREEING THAT THE PROGRAM HAS FAILED. THERE IS NO PLAN TO RECONCILE THE KNOWN DAMAGE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES CAUSED BY THE FAILURES OF THE BANK ONLY TO MAKE FORWARD FACING CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. SO IN THESE EXAMPLES WE SEE THAT CARBS OVERSIGHT ROLE OVER OUR AIR DISTRICTS WHO CONTROL IMPORTANT STATIONARY AND AREA WIDE SOURCES IS FAILING. AND THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT AIR DISTRICTS ARE ADOPTING AND ENFORCING THE BEST RULES AND POLICIES FOR CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS. SO SEGUEING TO DISCUSSING THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS AND MY PARTICIPATION AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- COMMITTEE MEMBER IT ABSOLUTELY HAS BEEN HURRIED AND RUSHED- WE RECOGNIZE THAT CARP STAFF ARE CONTINUALLY WORKING ON THEIR REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND THIS PLAN COMES UP TO BE. UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS- THE PROCESS HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND FRANKLY HAS MOVED SO QUICKLY THAT IT HAS CAUGHT OUT MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE SUBSTANTIVE INPUT FROM FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES. AND EXHIBITS AN UNDERLYING DYNAMIC THAT CONTINUES TO DISADVANTAGED GROUPS WITH LESS RESOURCES. AGAIN IT'S JUST ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF BEING APPOINTED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. ALMOST AN ENTIRE WEEK OF SEVERAL BACK TO BACK DAYS OF MULTI OUR WORKSHOPS WERE SCHEDULED AND INITIALLY WITH NO BREAKS UNTIL WE REQUESTED THEM. SINCE JUNE WE'VE HAD FIFTEEN MEETINGS OF VIDAK OFFICIAL MEETINGS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE PREP AND DEBRIEF WORKGROUPS OR WORKSHOPS- AND MANY OF US ARE AS YOU ALL ARE SERVING IN MANY OTHER ROLES SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL BUSY I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT WE HAVE RAISED MANY TIMES CONCERNS. ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE TIMELINE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK IN ORDER TO SHAPE THE MODELING. MODELING IS A FUNDAMENTAL AND UNDERLYING ASPECT OF WHAT GOES INTO THE SCOPING PLAN AND MODELS ARE TOOLS THAT ARE USED AS A MEANS TO AN END. IF YOU PUT FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS INTO A MODEL YOU'RE GOING TO GET BAD INPUT OUTPUTS AT THE END. STAFF HAVE NOT FULLY RELEASED THEIR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS WHICH INHIBITS OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK AT THIS STAGE IN THE PROCESS. AND NOW WE HAVE SCENARIOS RELEASED AND ALREADY STAFF RECOMMENDING A SCENARIO BEFORE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FULLY ANALYZE EVEN WHAT'S BEEN MODELED. THERE ARE ALSO TROUBLING ASSUMPTIONS IN THE MODELING AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW- PRETTY MUCH FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS ALMOST EVERY WORKSHOP CARB STAFF HAVE STATED THAT ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED. THIS MODELING NOW HAS UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS A 90% CAPTURE RATE FOR ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE WHICH IS NOT REALISTIC AND HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN ANYWHERE- AND FURTHERMORE WE ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL FOR NORTH NATURAL SOURCES OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION WHICH AGAIN IS WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS. FUNDAMENTALLY WE'RE NOT ON TRACK FOR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND MODELS ARE THEORY SO WE NEED THE ACTUAL APPLICATION TO FOLLOW THROUGH. NOT ALL SOLUTIONS CAN BE TECHNOLOGY BASED SO IN THE WORK THAT WE DO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME MAYBE WE COULD JUST GET GIANT FANS AND BLOW THE AIR POLLUTION TO SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT- FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO AT THE END OF THE DAY RIGHT. AND NOW IN THE VALLEY WE HAVE MULTIPLE PROPOSED PROJECTS TO ESSENTIALLY TAKE GIANT TUBES AND PIPES AND LOCK CARBON UNDERGROUND FOREVER WITH LITTLE TO NO CONSEQUENCES AND I WISH THAT THAT MAGICAL THINKING WAS POSSIBLE. BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND MOVE FROM ASPIRATIONS TO ACTIONS THAT ARE EQUITY CENTERED. BECAUSE HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR GOALS IS AS IMPORTANT AS ACHIEVING OUR GOALS. I DO HAVE HOPE IN THE WORK THAT WE DO IN EACH RACK AND I WAS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION. THAT WE CAN CO POWER WITH PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ZERO CARBON INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUITABLE PUBLIC SERVICES. THAT SUPPORT COMMUNITY WELLBEING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO EXPRESS GREAT APPRECIATION FOR ALL OF THE PARTNERS THAT HAVE HELPED DEVELOP THE ROBUST RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO YOU ALL. IT'S BEEN A GREAT COLLECTIVE EFFORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO COME UP WITH THE TWENTY EIGHT. PAGES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THUS FAR THAT AGAIN IT'S JUST AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON. THE ACTUAL SCENARIOS THEMSELVES OR THE ADDITIONAL- HEALTH AN AIR POLLUTION MODELING BUT STILL ON GOING. SO IT WAS A MADE YOUR EFFORT TO PUT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER THERE'VE ALSO BEEN COMMUNITY COALITIONS WORKING TO INFORM THE PROCESS. SUCH AS THE BUILDING ENERGY EQUITY AND POWER OR BEEP COALITION WHICH HAS HELD COMMUNITY WAS LISTENING SESSIONS ABOUT BUILDING DECARBONIZATION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOP THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE THAT'S HAPPENED THUS FAR OFFICIALLY FROM THE JACK ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND. THAT C. ABOUT COORDINATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HAD OVER A HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS. FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN OUR FRONT LINE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND THE OVER ARCHING QUESTION THAT WE ASK THEM WAS. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT THAT YOU WANT IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND THAT YOU WANT FROM CLIMATE JUSTICE. I SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL AND ATTACHMENT OF A- VISUAL SKETCH FROM A SKETCH ARTIST IT'S CALLED A MENTAL MAP. THAT REALLY SUMMARIZES AND HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE KEY THEMES OF WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THESE SESSIONS. AND AGAIN WE HEAR- OPTIMISM AND EXCITEMENT FOR INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE TAILORED ACROSS TRANSPORTATION BUILDINGS FOOD ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES. JUXTAPOSED WITH A FEAR OF CONTINUING TO BE LEFT BEHIND BY THESE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MADE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE OUR FRONTLINE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. OFTENTIMES WHEN WE RAISE THESE BIG AND BOLD VISIONS AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT WE HEAR FROM AGENCIES LIKE THE CARROT CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THAT'S NOT OUR AUTHORITY OR WE CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW. THE SCOPING PLAN IS AN IMPORTANT EXERCISE THAT SENDS MARKET AND POLICY SIGNALS RELATED TO KEY TECHNOLOGY CHOICES AND WE WANT THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND RECOGNITION. THAT MONEY AND TECHNOLOGY WILL NOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. THE SCOPING PLAN PROVIDES STATE DIRECTION ON HOW TO MEET CLIMATE GOALS AND AN ACTIONABLE VISION THAT MUST INCORPORATE EQUITY RESILIENCE AND JUSTICE. WHILE I KNOW THAT YOU JACK RECOMMENDATIONS ARE LENGTHY I WOULD PARTICULARLY POINT YOU TO THE LAST COUPLE OF PAGES WHERE THERE'S A CHART PUT TOGETHER BY GROUPS OF SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. ON ACTIONABLE MEASURES FOR US TO MEET OUR GOALS. TRULY THERE NEEDS TO BE COORDINATION ACROSS THE DIVISIONS OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ALL HAVE A STAKE IN THE OUTCOMES OF THE SCOPING PLAN. SO I CERTAINLY CAN'T DO JUSTICE TO ALL TWENTY EIGHT PAGES OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FROM SOME OF THE- MOST IMPORTANT SECTORS. WHEN YOU SEND TRANSPORTATION AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS AND MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WE KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES NEED BETTER CONNECTIVITY MOBILITY AND MATT MASS TRANSIT. AND TO CONTINUE THE AMBITIOUS COMMITMENTS TO ELECTRIFICATION WE NEED MORE INVESTMENTS AND RAPID BUSES LIGHT RAIL ANTI DISPLACEMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WALKING BIKING TO MEET OUR AMBITIOUS GOALS AND ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS. AS I ALLUDED TO IN MY INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION INTO INDUSTRIALIZED AGRICULTURE MUST ALSO TRANSITION TO AGROECOLOGICAL PRACTICES WE MUST PHASE OUT DAIRY BIO GAS AND PETRO CHEMICAL BASED PESTICIDES WE NEED AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION IN PESTICIDE USE BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS FOREST HEALTH WHICH I'M BY NO MEANS AND AN EXPERT IN BUT UNDERSTAND THAT WITH CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AND VAST. ATION OF ECOSYSTEMS BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO BE TAILORING SOLUTIONS DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO EMBRACE TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND INDIGENOUS PRACTICES WHICH WAS SOMETHING THA WE HEARD A LOT IN OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOP. AND REALLY AN INTEREST IN RESTORING ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS WITH PRIORITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BENEFIT IN MULTIPLE WAYS FROM FROM THINGS LIKE INCREASED. TREE CANOPY. FUNDAMENTALLY THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO CREATE A PLAN FOR HOW WE WILL PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUELS IT'S VERY POPULAR RHETORIC NOW TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUELS IN CALIFORNIA BUT HOW WILL WE ACTUALLY DO THAT. WE NEED CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN ENERGY AND NO RELIANCE ON CLIMATE DEADLINES LIKE CAR ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS UNPROVEN IT'S RISKY. AND IT'S BEEN STATED. BY CARB STAFF THAT ESSENTIALLY TO BE COST EFFECTIVE THAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE CONCENTRATED IN FRONT LINE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MOST COST EFFECTIVE. I WAS STRUCK LAST MONTH LISTENING TO THIS COMMITTEE HEARING AND HEARING THE E. THREE MODELLER WHO SPOKE STATING THAT WE COULD IN FACT MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE THOUGH CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGE WILL BE DIFFICULT. AND I WENT BACK AND READ THROUGH HER TESTIMONY AS I WAS PREPARING FOR THE HEARING TODAY. AND NOTED THAT HER CONCLUDING COMMENT IN HER WRITTEN SUMMARIES SAID THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS NOT A LACK OF AMBITION BUT A QUESTION OF HOW WE WILL FINANCE THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS. AND RAPIDLY DEPLOY IN ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN EVERY SECTOR IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE. IN THE CATEGORY OF FALSE SOLUTIONS WE ABSOLUTELY ALSO HAVE TO TOUCH ON CAP AND TRADE WHICH I WON'T GO INTO AT LENGTH SINCE OUR LAST WEEK- LAID OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT THEY'RE COMMITTEE HAVE- OVERALL IT'S A PROGRAM THAT CONTINUES TO CONCENTRATE POLLUTION IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BY DESIGN. HOW E. PA SEPT SECRETARY BLUMENFELD COMMITTED IN A JUNE EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY LETTER FOR A ROBUST EXAMINATION OF THE PROGRAM AND TO ADDRESS OUTSTANDING ISSUES. IT MUST BE ANALYZED FOR ITS OVERALL ROLE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT PAGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY OF THE E. JACK RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR VERY SPECIFIC LIST OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANALYSIS AND REFORMS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SO AS I WRAP UP I DO ALSO WANT TO LIFT UP THE COMMITMENT TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE A PERMANENT BODY AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THREE EIGHT FIVE NINE ONE EIGHT SAYS THE STATE BOARD BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SHALL CONVENE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO ADVISE IT IN DEVELOPING THE SCOPING PLAN PURSUANT TO SECTION THREE EIGHT FIVE SIX ONE. AND ANY OTHER PERTINENT MATTER IN IMPLEMENTING THIS DIVISION CERTAINLY THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IT IS AN ONGOING TASK. AN E. JACK NEEDS TO BE MADE A PERMANENT BODY WITH ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND CO POWER SOLUTIONS. WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO TRULY ENGAGE IN CO DESIGNED. TO INFORM THE LONG TERM INTEGRATION OF EQUITY ACROSS CARDS PROGRAMS LIKE AB SIX ONE SEVEN LIKE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ALONG WITH THE SCOPING PLAN. TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRACKING OF HEALTH METRICS. TO PROVIDE CRITICAL GROUNDS TRUE THING OF THE THEORY AND MODELS BY. BRINGING IN THE INFORMATION FROM IMPACTED COMMUNITY MMBERS AND INFORMING HOW PROGRAMS CAN BE TAILORED. WE MUST MOVE THE PROCESS TOWARDS CONSULTATION COLLABORATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU JACK STARTED THIS PROCESS WITH WHICH WAS A REQUEST FOR CO DESIGN. E. JACK HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE WANT THEM TO BE MEANINGFULLY INTEGRATED. SO LEGISLATORS IN YOUR OVERSIGHT ROLE I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DIRECT CARD CARD TO COMPLETE THE BUSINESS AS USUAL MARC MODELING FOR EXISTING POLICIES. TO RELEASE ALL OF THEIR MODELING ASSUMPTIONS AND DATA. TO CONDUCT A FULL PROGRAM REVIEW OF CAP AND TRADE AND TO ENFORCE EXISTING RULES AND POLICIES SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. WHY AND WHERE WE'RE NOT ON TRACK AND WHERE ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE. AND WITHIN YOUR OWN AUTHORITY I WOULD URGE YOU TO INCREASE COMMUNITY POWER TO INFORM DECISION MAKING ON INVESTMENTS THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN AND IN THE STATE BUDGET. I URGE A RECOGNITION THAT EXISTING LAWS ARE INADEQUATE AND WE MUST ADDRESS CUMULATIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO PASS BILLS THAT HELP US PLAN FOR A JUST TRANSITION OFF OF FOSSIL BASED EXTRACTIVE ECONOMY THAT TRULY ADDRESSES DEVELOPMENT OIL AND AGRICULTURE WITH BOLD ACTIONS CALIFORNIA IT NEEDS REAL ZERO NOT NOT ZERO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET ME OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BY SHARE BACKER. THANK YOU AT. I APPRECIATE ALL THE PRESENTATIONS FROM WONDERFUL AND REPORTER DISCUSSION- THE INITIAL DATA SUGGEST THAT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS. SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN TWENTY TWENTY OF COURSE WITH A PANDEMIC YOUR TERMS OF TOTAL EMISSIONS YEAH AND- BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS ONLY ABOUT 2% LOWER THAN TWENTY NINETEEN IN SPITE OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC SLOWDOWNS. SO WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AT LEAST NOT FAST ENOUGH AND IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- BEFORE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AND HAD A WEEK EVERY CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY. ONE QUESTION I HAD IS- IS ARE VERY AMBITIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE IN THIS DOCUMENT I'M SURE MADE RICHER RAN OFF WHAT OTHER POLICY ACTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HIT THE 203540% REDUCTION TARGET. IF THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE WERE NOT SO OPTIMISTIC- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH FOR THE REDUCTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION OR BUILDINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. M. I GUESS I I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT AND WE NEED TO TRANSFORM. MANY SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY. WE NEED TO TRANSFORM TRANSPORTATION TO BE NEARLY COMPLETELY FREE OF PETROLEUM AS CALLED FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WITHOUT MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THAT SECTOR- WE WILL NOT STAY ON TRACK SO THAT WE NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN OUR WORK THERE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE'RE ON TRACK ASSUMES. KIND OF A LINEAR PROGRESS YEAR TO YEAR- AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAPPEN. WE KNOW EMISSIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- IN TWENTY TWENTY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A BOUNCE BACK BUT WE HAVEN'T QUANTIFIED THE NUMBERS FOR EITHER OF THOSE YEARS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROVIDED SOME. ESTIMATES BUT WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE ESTIMATES ARE NOT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND- AND ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED TO KIND OF SET POLICY GOING FORWARD RECOGNIZING THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. I'M AND- AND WITH AS I MENTIONED IN MY PRISON TATIAN THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES WITH ALL OF OUR STRATEGIES FOR INSTANCE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY- AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. A LOT OF WHAT DOCTOR GROUP WHITE SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSIT THE IMPORTANCE OF- ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR GETTING AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF. HOUSING A YOU KNOW HAVING A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN THE STATE BUT HAVING THAT HOUSING LOCATED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS WORKERS TO GET TO WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO- SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE ROAD. I'M ALL OF THOSE LAND USE DECISIONS DECISIONS ABOUT- MAKING COMMUNITIES MORE SUSTAINABLE ALL HAVING MORE ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF JEFF TRANSPORTATION THOSE ARE ALL CRITICAL POLICY GOALS THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND IT'S AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE BEHIND. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY PIECES IT'S THINKING OF ALL OF THE STRATEGIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE PROGRESS ON ALL OF THE STRATEGIES. SO THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK IS IF WE SEE ANY OF OUR STRATEGIES FOLLOWING BEHIND WE NEED TO EXPLORE THEM UNDERSTAND WAYS WE CAN MAKE THEM MORE ROBUST AND STRONGER. AND ALSO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO LEAN INTO OTHER STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON ALL OF OUR GOALS. I'M ANY SOME ADVOCATES HAVE HAVE ARGUED THAT IS HERE FOR YOU OAK AWAY SAID SCENARIO- AND I WOULD AGREE. THAT THE WHAT ABOUT US IN THE CLOSER TO SCENARIO ONE IN TERMS OF AGGRESSIVE EARLY. ACTIONS TO START THE TRANSITION WHILE GIVING IT A LONGER RUNWAY. SAY TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE TO GET TO NET ZERO ME THAT WOULD REFLECT I THINK IT'S AN AREA BETWEEN. MAYBE SCENARIO ONE AND SCENARIO THREE WHICH BELIES. REALLY HEAVILY ON ON CARBON REMOVAL. SO AM I THINK AS- I'LL SAY A COUPLE THINGS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I THINK ALL OF OUR SCENARIOS ARE INFORMED BY A LOT OF INPUT AND YOU KNOW SCENARIO FOR. OUR ALTERNATIVE FOR- AT YOU KNOW WAS INFORMED BY INPUT FROM- FROM STAKEHOLDERS- AND- AND I GUESS I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT. ANY OF THESE SCENARIOS WE CAN BE MORE AGGRESSIVE ON DIFFERENT STRATEGIES WITHIN THOSE SCENARIOS- SO AS WE AS WE PICK THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WE CAN ALSO HIGHLIGHT KIND OF EARLY ACTION AND YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE A KIND OF A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT THE BOARD HAS WHEN IT- IS PRESENTED WITH THE SCENARIOS AND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS THE COSTS THAT YOU KNOW THE OVERALL EFFECT ON GDP- EFFECT ON JOBS- AND THE BENEFITS OF EACH SCENARIO AND- LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT. STRATEGIES WITHIN THEM AND HIGHLIGHTING YOU KNOW ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO- FASTER WITH PARTICULAR STRATEGY SO THAT'LL ALL BE PART OF THE BOARD CONVERSATION IN JUNE OKAY YEAH WE JUST- TO CONSIDERATION OF THAT OF THAT THIS AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS IN SYRIA ONE. BUT GIVING IT MORE TIME FRAME- YEAH AND I AND I ALSO YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THE STRATEGIES LIKE FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE ONE AND ALTERNATIVE THREE IS. OUR RATE OF ASSUMPTIONS ON OUR VEHICLE TRANSITIONS AND OUR RATE OF ASSUMPTIONS ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION YOU KNOW AND CAN CAN THE RATE OF THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS. BE SPED UP AND YOU KNOW THE- THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IN THOSE AREAS AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK WILL WILL HELP- IN OUR STATE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR THE- SEVENTY PP BE OZONE STANDARD WHICH HAS TO BE MET BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE STRATEGIES WERE THINKING ABOUT IN THAT PLAN IS YOU KNOW CAN WE MOVE- ARE DIESEL TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR D. USEFUL LIFE LIKE WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES AROUND THAT ARE THEIR INCENTIVE STRATEGIES AROUND THAT ARE THERE REGULATORY STRATEGIES LIKE. WHAT ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE- MOVING THOSE VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT REALLY- PUTTING THE PEDAL TO THE METAL AND MAKING. PROGRESS- IN MEETING THE GOALS. MAYBE ONE MORE THEY'LL GIVE TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO CAN TEACH IS QUESTION I AM THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE. IN THE WAY. THAT COVERS INTERPRETING SB ONE HUNDRED- THEY'RE STILL CONSIDERABLE EMISSIONS COMING FROM ELECTRICITY EVEN IN A- IN IN ALL SCENARIOS WILL ACCEPT SCENARIO ONE- SO YOU KNOW 80% REDUCTION EMISSIONS MEANS ABOUT THE MEASURE OUT EIGHTY MILLION METRIC ONS- FOR THE WHOLE ECONOMY SO WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION METRIC TONS LEFT OVER FROM ELECTRICITY. W. A LARGE PART OF REMAINING EMISSIONS SO THIS WINDOW IS WE FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT I THINK THEY WERE EXPECTING TO GET TO THIRTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS BY TWENTY THIRTY OF ELECTRICITY SECTOR FROM CORRECT- SO I WOULD JUST URGE BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN EXCEPT FOR DINNER WHILE THEY'RE STILL A LOT OF EMISSIONS WATCHERS THE SECTOR FEELS THAT WE SHOULD GO TO DRIVE OUT. SO THE ONE OF THE EIGHT. I AM WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- TO KNOW THAT. IMPLEMENTATION IS SO IMPORTANT. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND I JUST WANT TO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS YOU KNOW THOSE PROJECTS NEED TO. TO BE PERMITTED THEY NEED TO BE APPROVED THEY NEED TO BE. BUILT AND- AND WE NEED TO STAY ON THAT TRAJECTORY TO MAKE HUGE PROGRESS- IN THAT CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION- AND- I NEVER MISS HAPPEN OP. I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF MAKE THAT EDITORIAL COMMENT THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DEPLOY DEPLOY DEPLOY- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- A LOT OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE. LOCAL DECISIONS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- CONTINUE TO HAPPEN SO THAT WE ARE GETTING. THE STEEL IN THE GROUND THAT. GREENS OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS. AGREED VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH STERN. THANK YOU- TWENTY MAKE UP A ABBREVIATED COMMENT AND- ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE VICE CHAIRS- URGINGS OF CONSIDERATION ON THAT AGGRESSIVENESS I'M IN THE NEAR TERM. AND NOT GETTING STUCK IN IN THE IMPASSE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO JUST WAIT ON. OTHER AGENCIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES FOR MERGING BUT I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO HEAR YOU OCCUPY THAT ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE LEAD AIR POLLUTION REGULATOR AND USING THOSE A FORTIES THAT YOU HAVE- UNDER SB THIRTY TWO IN ANOTHER AREAS OF LAW. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW AT THE OUTSET. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AVOIDED AIR QUALITY RELATED DEATHS THAT WERE AVOIDING IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF OUR PROGRESS AND CONTINUING TO ROUTE THIS WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO ON THE REGULATORY SIDE FOR DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH OUR HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR SIP. I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH HOW MOBILE SOURCE RULES- ARE ROLLED OUT AND I WOULD APPLAUD YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON THE LIGHT DUTY FRONT I THINK WE CAN DO EVEN MORE. I MEAN ANY MORE LIGHT DUTY I KNOW IT'S JUST A ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL BUT- I THINK WE CAN BE BOLDER AND I THINK IN THE LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO GIVE YOU SPACE TO BE THAT BOLD AND LET YOU KNOW THAT WERE WITH YOU- AND- AND THE SAME GOES ON. ON ALL THESEOTHER SECTORS ON THE POWER FRONT ON THE INDUSTRIAL FRONT- YOU KNOW. THE MARKETS NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS WHOLE PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT'S THE REALIZATION IS THAT CABIN TRAITS NOT GONNA SOLVE. THIS CRISIS AND- M. IT'S GOING TO BE THERE- AND I DO THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE MARKET MECHANISMS BUT I'M I'M I'M JUST FOCUS ON THE DETAILS OF THE SECTORAL SORT OF DIRECT EMISSIONS APPROACHES. AND NOT ALSO JUST BETTING ON UNTESTED TECHNOLOGIES WAY TO GET US THERE. BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CARBON REMOVAL QUESTION. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE TECHNOLOGY SCENARIOS. WORKED IN CARBON REMOVAL THROUGHOUT MY CAREER AND YOU KNOW WATCHING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AROUND THAT GREAT PROMISE OF CARBON CAPTURE. AND YOU KNOW EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS LATER ON FUTURE CHEN YOU HAVE A HAWKING MASS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT ISN'T DOING ANYTHING IS COMPLETELY DISMANTLE. AND SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM ABOUT EXCITING NEW TECHNOLOGY IDEAS BUILDING ELECTROLYZER IS FOR HYDROGEN AND- GOING BIG ON. YOU KNOW CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN IN INTO INDUSTRIAL AND EVEN INTO THE OIL SECTOR BUT I. WE HAVE A STE APPROACH A SERIES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING. AND THEY'RE LITERALLY TRANSFORMING THE ENTIRE GLOBAL MARKET JUST FROM DOING THE BASIC STICKING OF THOSE FUNDAMENTALS CLEAN AIR. OUR STANDARDS NO ALL THE SPACE THAT WE WERE JUST GIVEN FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT TO ME IS A SIGNAL THAT CALIFORNIA IS PUT IN. UNFORTUNATELY THE SITUATION WHERE THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S GOING TO COUNT ON US TO KEEP LEADING. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN. AT LEAST FROM A FROM A REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE CONGRESS BE ABLE TO ACT BUT- BUT I DON'T JUST WANT TO CHASE. YOU KNOW TAX CREDITS OR SORT OF NEAR TERM BUDGET OPPORTUNITIES AND LET THAT DRIVE OUR POLICY. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO STICK TO DOING THIS THE CALIFORNIA WAY AND- AND I THINK THAT MEANS JUSTICE IN JOBS FIRST. AND I THINK WE CAN GET THAT DONE SO I APPRECIATE THE HEARING TODAY AND LET HIM LET ME MAKE A FEW REMARKS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THERE IS IF YOU HAVE A- FEW MINUTES I THE NEXT QUESTION. I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME IMPORTANT. CARBON CAPTURE BILLS COMING TO YOUR YOUR COMMITTEE. YEAH IF I CAN- JUST JUMP RIGHT IN AND ASK A QUESTION DIRECTLY RELEVANT O ADD TO. THIS TOPIC SO I CHAIR RANDOLPH- AS A DOCTOR GROUP WHITE- REFER TO IT IT APPEARS THAT CARP IS ASSUMING THAT CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY HAS A CAPTURE RATE OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THIS COMMITTEE THERE THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLETHE PETRA NOTEBOOK CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE PROJECT IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ONE OF THE LARGEST CCS PLANTS IN THE WORLD REPORTED A 33% CAPTURE RATE. AND ANOTHER PROJECT THIS SHIP THE SHELL QUEST CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE PROJECT IN CANADA REPORTED ONLY CAPTURING 48% SO HOW IS IT THAT THAT CARP CAN ASSUME A CAPTURE RATE OF 90% AS PART AS PART OF ITS-IT'S A- SCOPING PLAN. DELIBERATIONS SO IT D. M. WE HAVE. LITERATURE ANALYSIS THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW PRESENTED IN THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN THAT TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT A POTENTIAL RATES OF CARBON CAPTURE- AND IT CAN BE AS HIGH AS NINETY PERCENT- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE- ITO SORT OF WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT- UNIT YOU IDENTIFY A STRATEGY. YOU IDENTIFY THE UNCERTAINTIES WITH THAT STRATEGY RATELIKE WE ALREADY KNOW AT THIS POINT THAT- IT'S SORT OF THE DEPLOYMENT OF CCS PROJECTS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO B. AS QUICKLY AS OUR INITIAL MODELING IS ASSUMING AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO ADJUST THAT- AND- AND THEN WE MAY NEED TO WOULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THE ACTUAL RATE OF CAPTURE IS- SO. WE WILL BE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE DRAFT- AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SHARING OF DATA THAT FOLKS CAN KIND OF. PICK APART AND TAKE A LOOK AT ADD TO AND COMMENT ON AS PART OF THE PROCESS MMHM. OKAY I GUESS THE CONCERN THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE- FACING NOW IS THAT. MANY WHERE WHERE WE'RE HEARING FROM. FROM FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY FROM FROM THE- THE- THE BUILDING ENTREES THAT REPRESENT- THE FOSSIL FUEL WORKERS THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO. PHASE OUT ANY FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS JUST GOING TO CAPTURE MAGICALLY CAPTURE ALL THE CARBON AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO DRILL AND RELY ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE HOW YOU YOU DON'T MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRESS THE URGENCY OF DEPLOYING AND PERMITTING RENEWABLE PROJECTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I MEAN UNDER ANY SCENARIO THAT THAT THE A. R. B. IS A CONSIDERING NOW DO DO YOU DO YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO WHERE WE CAN REALISTICALLY ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY FOCUSING ON PHASING OUT OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS- 1100% I MEAN WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUEL. COMBUSTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR GOALS AND THAT IS. YOU KNOW THE PRIMARY GOAL OF MANY OF THE PIECES OF OUR PORTFOLIO. BUT EVEN IF WE DO THAT EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE STILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WE HAVE EXISTING BUILDING SO THAT ALL ARE SET UP TO USE FOSSIL FUELS WE HAVE INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED. A ZERO CARBON ALTERNATIVE FOR HOW THEY OPERATE- AND SO IT'S A THOSE EMISSIONS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. HOW CAN WE- CAPTURE THOSE EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE AND HOW COULD WE DO DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE AS A STATE CAN SUPPORT AND DEPLOY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY SO IN OUR BASE. MY ON OKAY- THESE THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ALWAYS FASCINATING TO ME BECAUSE- IN WE THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE JUSTICE ANY THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE- LIKE EQUITY- AND SO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE- THE ONE QUESTION THAT I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES IS- WHAT WHAT'S THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON OUR GDP IN IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN EACH OF THE ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THERE IS GOING TO BE. TO BE A COST AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THIS THAT I'M ALWAYS VERY FASCINATED- A BY IS A WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD THINKS AS WELL- I MIGHT BEEN ON RECORD- AS YOU DELVE I STILL GOT SCARS I'M OVER. CAP AND TRADE- THAT RUN PRETTY DEEP- AND I FELT AT THE TIME WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE TO LEAD WE NEED. TO GET TO A PLACE BUT NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE REST THE WORLD OR WE STOP PULLING CARBON OUT OF THE DIRT- AND PUTTING IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT ATMOSPHERE. AND PUTTING IT BACK INTO BACK INTO THE GROUND THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELYTRUE WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO THAT WITHOUT RUINING OUR ECONOMY. AND IT'S FASCINATING ONE WHEN YOU BRING THIS UP- BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY ALL THERE YOU GO AGAIN CHAD YOU KNOW- YOU MUST BE THERE'S YOUR CONSERVATIVE SIDE COMING OUT AGAIN WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY WELL YOU KNOW MOM SAID- BACK WHEN I WAS A KID THAT MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES- AND THAT WAS TRUE THEN AND IT IS STILL. TRUE TODAY AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST. WHERE CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO LEAD NOT JUST IN THE U. S. THE IMPACT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING US. THE END THEY'RE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT IMPACT- THIS IS ALL GOING TO HAVE HERE. BEFORE THE BEFORE BUT NATIONALLY WE'RE GOING TO ACT. AND IT'S ALSO FASCINATING ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WHEN I WATCH EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN THE NEWS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER IN EUROPE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE- I'LL CALL THEM DICTATORS BRUTAL DICTATORS- THAT ARE A POUNCING ON COUNTRIES RIGHT NEXT TO THEM- OVER. OIL AND- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT OIL AND GAS I'M SEEING THE REST OF EUROPE. AND WHO SAID THAT THEY'RE GONNA MOVE A TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO. ON WHERE THEY'RE STILL A BOOK OF NOT WILLING TO STEP UP. YOU TALK ABOUT MORE JUSTICE AND TALK ABOUT MORALITY- STILL NOT WILLING TO BUILD A PULL THE PLUG ON THEIR- OIL AND GAS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE. AN IMPACT ON THEIR ON IN DECREASING THEIR THEIR GDP SO WE HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS. A FROM A FROM ECONOMIC. TERM I IN ECONOMIC TERMS AS WELL. AS OF THE ONE THING IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT I HAVE I DON'T HAVE- YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE FOR ALTERNATIVES- WHAT ARE THE IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE. IS IT GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR- ON CALIFORNIA'S GDP- IS IT GOING TO BE A NET POSITIVE- AND HOW DO WE GET THEM. TO OUR GOALS A REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE. THAT WE HAVE A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. BUT SO THAT IS THE KEY YOU KNOW SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT THE BOARD WILL NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN IT REVIEWS THE DRAFT PLAN IN JUNE BECAUSE EACH OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. HAS HAS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND- AND COSTS BUT THEY SHOW. YOU TO THE ALTERNATIVE SHOWS A GROWING ECONOMY AND WE CAN CONSISTENTLY HAVE A GROWING ECONOMY AND THEN THE QUESTION IS JUST SORT OF- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH- OF- YOU KNOW. HOW MUCH WILL THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT OF EACH ALTERNATIVE BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT GROWING ECONOMY. I'M AND- AND SO THAT'LL BE WHAT THE BOARD WILL BE CONSIDERING AS IT WEIGHS. ON EACH OF THE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES AND WHAT- THE AFFECTED EACH OF THE ALTERNATIVES WILL BE I MEAN I WILL NOTE THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. SORT OF THE TIMELINE AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ARE YOU LOOKING AT TWNTY FORTY FIVE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AT. THE BENEFITS YOU ACHIEVE IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE RUNWAY IN TERMS OF A TIME LINE. IS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE COSTS COME DOWN. AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE NEW OPPORTUNITIES- COME ONLINE IN A WAY THAT REDUCES. THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS- TO CONSUMERS OF THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. YOU KNOW AS THE REDUCTION WE HAVE SEEN IN THE COST OF BOTH. VEHICLE BATTERIES AND IT YEAH- INDUSTRIAL SCALE- BATTERIES FOR ENERGY STORAGE. YOU CAN SEE THESE TREND LINES YOU CAN SEE THE TREND LINES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY- YOU KNOW WIND SOLAR. THOSE STRATEGIES GOING DOWN- AND IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE RUNWAY- A TWO. X. X. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE COST BENEFITS- THAN THAT CAN MAKE THE WHOLE TRANSITION. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK SOME OF OUR GREAT WAS CHAIRED. THE ISSUE OF ALLOWANCES- CONSISTENTLY COMES UP. AND YOU KNOW JUST THE TOO MANY ALLOWANCES. ALTER THAT MAY NOT BE- HELP IN STABILIZE YOU KNOW THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY. CHAIR CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE US SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT OPTIONS IMPOSSIBLE- YOU KNOW. CORRECTION THAT THE WE AT THE BOARD MIGHT BE GOING IN AND PERHAPS ALSO DOMINO'S SPOKE ABOUT- THE ALLOWANCES MAY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AS WELL I THINK THAT'S A HUGE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION THAT COMES UP- CONSISTENTLY AND SO WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WATCHING ONE IN HERE YOUR RESPONSES. YEAH I MEAN IT'S ABSOLUTELY M. A. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US TO ADDRESS- AND SO OUR PLAN IS THAT WE WILL COMPLETE THE SCOPING PLAN AND THEN AS PART OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION STEPS- WE WILL BE TAKING A LOOK AT- AT CAP AND TRADE AND WE WILL LOOK AT THAT QUESTION OF- YOU KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS A ALLOWANCES WE WILL LOOK AT AND REGULATORY- PROVISIONS LAKE- THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND OTHER THINGS- AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT BE DONE. AS PART OF THAT ROBUST REGULATORY PROCESS BECAUSE THERE ARE A BY A WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS OUT THERE. ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT I MEAN AS AS DALLAS MENTION THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO KIND OF TACKLE THE ISSUE AND IT HAS DIFFERENT SORT OF EFFECTS ON THE PROGRAM IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SORT OF HAVING IT BE PART OF A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHAT CHANGES TO THE PROGRAMMER NEEDED WHAT UPDATES CAN HAPPEN AND HOW THOSE UPDATES CAN BE STRUCTURED IN A WAY. THAT PROVIDES KIND OF THE REGULATORY CERTAINTY THAT WE NEED- IS ED YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET ALL OF THE ALL OF YOU POINTS AND ALL OF THAT- THE- PUBLIC IMPACT AND SO. WE WILL EMBARK ON THAT PROCESS AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE WITH THE SKIPPING PLAN. THOUSAND OF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTED TO ADD. TANK YOU. I THINK I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ARE WAY BEYOND THE EITHER OR OR KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE WERE HAVING OVER A DECADE AGO- I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOING THERE NEED TO BE A ROCK VARIETY OF DIRECT REGULATORY MEASURES. AND PROGRAMS AND STANDARDS TO ACHIEVE DIRECTED MARVEL BENEFITS AND SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO INSERT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE COST EFFECTIVENESS IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S. GOALS AS WELL FOR MEMBERS MAYES WAS REFERRING TO AND I THINK THAT THE CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO HAS TO WEAVE THESE TWO APPROACHES TOGETHER. WHAT'S REALLY CRUCIAL IS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESS AND ONE THAT IT NOT A ROAD THE INFLUENCE OF THE OTHER. SO WHEN WE HAVE A THEIR CARBON MARKET IN PLACE IN THE OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS OR HOPEFULLY INCREASINGLY SUCCESSFUL EVEN GOING SO FAR AS REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BUT IN ANY CASE VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES ETCETERA. THEN THAT CAN POTENTIALLY FREE UP ALLOWANCES. ABOUT AFFECT YOU PUSH DOWN IN ONE PLACE THE SAME EMISSIONS POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE AND ALL THAT HAPPENS IS THE PRICE OF ALLOWANCES FALL IN THAT REMOVES THE INCENTIVE IN THAT CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE. THAT THE MARKET CAN PLAY SO WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR A MARKET DESIGN THAT ALIGNS TO THE MARKET WITH THE REGULATORY MEASURES AND SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER AND REINFORCE THE INCENTIVE FOR DIRECT ACTION THROUGH REGULATIONS THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INDEPENDENT ACTORS AND FIRMS. IT'S SUCH A REDUCE EMISSIONS AND NOT HAVE THAT BOUNCE BACK IN A ROW THE EFFECT OF THE MARKET. THAT'S WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE. THANK YOU HOW HIGH ON THE THINGS TO DO LIST SHOULD THIS BE ON IN TERMS OF- WHEN WE- I. GET CLOSE TO WRAPPING UP THE SCOPING PLAN I MEAN. YOU KNOW IT COULD BE. I GET HOME ON THURSDAY EVENINGS AND I GOT A HONEY DO LIST THAT I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF AND- AND THEY'RE RANKED IN. TERMS OF WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT GIVEN THE RIGHT AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ALLOWANCES WHERE WHERE DOES THIS. OR SHOULD IT FALL. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. GET US. STRAINED OUT LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE- DISCUSSIONS AND WE WERE JUST HAVING WITH OUR- GOOD FRIENDS. IN THE SENATE I MEAN DOES IT UP THERE IS IT IN BETWEEN. BOB I WILL GO AHEAD- YOU KNOW I MEAN I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT THAT AN IMPORTANT NEXT STEP ANYTIME YOU ADOPT YOU KNOW AFTER YOU ADOPT THE SCOPING PLAN- AND AFTER WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY COLLECTS TO COLLECT DATA BASED ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS RATE LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROGRAM AND SEE WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE- AND THERE COULD BE CHANGES MADE FOR IT YOU KNOW IN ANY NUMBER OF AREAS THAT WE COULD CONSIDER. AND I GUESS I THINK OF IT KIND OF AS A LAWYER RIGHT ONCE YOU OPEN UP A REGULATION LAKE SAYS SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS CAP AND TRADE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME UP AND WILL BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION- SO I THINK OF ALL THOSE ISSUES AS KIND OF PROCEEDING TOGETHER RIGHT LIKE ALL OF THE ADVOCACY THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN OVER TIME IT ALL SORT OF COULD BECOMES PART OF THE DISCUSSION- AND- AND SO WE WILL FINISH THE COPING PLAN WE WILL YOU KNOW COLLECT MORE DATA ON THE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS NOW. THEN THE FUN BEGINS. IF I MAY COMMENT I WOULD SEPARATE THE QUESTION IN THE ALLOWANCE MARKET INTO SORT OF TWO PARTS ONE IS TO DO WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE MARKET SUCH THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO WORK WELL WITH THE OTHER REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND I WOULD PUT THAT HIGH ON THE TO DO LIST BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN BE DONE. RELATIVELY STAND STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WITH IT WITH THE EXERCISING EXISTING REGULATORY AUTHORITY JUST IN THE WAY THAT A OR B. HAS USE THAT AUTHORITY PREVIOUSLY SO FOR AS I MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THE INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL PRICE STEPS OR SOMETHING SO THE MARKET AUTOMATICALLY RESPONDS TO OTHER INITIATIVES THAT THE STATE IS MAKING. THEM THERE IS A BIGGER THINK. THE ONLY A BIGGER THING BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY TO PUT TO COME TO A DECISION IS A HARDER THING TO DO. ABOUT ADJUSTING THE OVERALL SUPPLY IN A DIRECTED WAY BY PERHAPS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED EACH YEAR I ALSO THINK THAT THAT'S- VERY IMPORTANT AND- AND INCREASINGLY URGENT BUT- IT INCREASINGLY WERE IS GOING TO REQUIRE A PROCESS THAT I'M SURE CHIU AROUND OFF WILL. LOSE A LOT OF SLEEP OVER BEFORE RESOLUTION ABOUT DECISION COMES TOGETHER I KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. BUT I. WOULD NOT WANT TO HOLD THE ONE FOR THE OTHER AND I THINK THAT. MARKET REDESIGNED COULD HAPPEN AN EXPEDITED WAY. I THINK JUST THE- LINE OF QUESTIONS MAY BE CAUSING A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING- TO NOT HAVE SOME GOOD NIGHTS OF SLEEP. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND- MONTHS AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE- I KNOW THERE ARE. TWO SIDES TO THIS DISCUSSION- AND- THEY BALK TO US AND ASKED US YOU KNOW- TO THE CONSIDERED ONE ACTION OR OR THE OTHER I. I'M OF THE MINDSET THAT WE DO HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF ALLOWANCES UP THERE AND- THERE WILL BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. YOU TOUCHED ON VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN AND I KNOW. ALL OF US UP HERE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S. ORDERS TO ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM I HAVE A- VESTED INTEREST GIVEN THE- NATURE OF THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IN THE ROLE THEY CAN PLAY. I JUST FOR THE STATE BUT NATIONALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. PROVIDING THE ESSENTIAL RESOURCE- THAT- STORAGE BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE REQUIRES AS WELL AS VEHICLES. HOW ARE WE IN AND LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS HAVE EVERYONE ACROSS THE PANELS HERE- WE THINKING ABOUT THOSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHO LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY HOMES WHO DON'T HAVE STREET PARKING WHO DON'T. DON'T FIT INTO THIS EQUATION OF EVERYONE WILL HAVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE. AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE- LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THE THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT AGAIN DON'T FIT INTO. THAT PARTICULAR. FORMULA THAT- THAT WERE PURSUING CURRENTLY. N. DA AND WE REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT- TO FIT INTO. THAT PARTICULAR TARGET POPULATION THAT- THAT ARE CONCERNED. FROM MANY ASPECTS- OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. OKAY I'LL START M. I WOULD SAY AS A COUPLE THINGS I MEAN YOU KNOW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING THE ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THIS YEAR MISSION MOBILITY THAT WE WANT TO SEE AN END SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CPC AND OTHERS- TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES AROUND- TACKLING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES TACKLING RURAL CHARGING. TACKLING MULTI FAMILY- CHARGING YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW CHARGING PAUSES AND WORKPLACE CHARGING AND WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR KIND OF LAND USE ROLE- WHERE CAN THEY LOCATE CHARGING THAT THERE AT RESIDENTS CAN USE- AND ALSO KIND OF TO YOUR POINT RECOGNIZING THAT- NOT EVERYONE- HAS- ACCESS TO- A BRAND NEW CAR RATE- AND SO HAVING THEM. OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS TO- PURCHASE- YOU KNOW DEVELOPING A ROBUST SECONDARY MARKET ENSURING THAT THAT'S THAT THOSE VEHICLES ARE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET ENSURING THAT THE ROBUST- AND- AND- CONTINUING TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. A WIDE SUITE OF CHARGING OPTIONS OF THAT FOLKS CAN USE- IS PART OF ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. BRIEFLY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE MY PORTFOLIO BUT I WILL MAKE TAKE OBVIOUS SUB- ENDORSED OBVIOUS OBSERVATION THAT SHARON OFF MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT I MEAN I SAW THIS BACK. IN MY EARLIER DAYS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BREAKOUT OF INCLUSIONARY HOUSING IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE SEVENTIES THE REPAIR WORK REQUIRES A TURNAROUND AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND WE CAN'T JUST SAY IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DOING SOMETHING WRONG I THINK THE STATE IS TO PROVIDE THE PROPER KIND OF INCENTIVES AND DIRECTOR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT CERTAIN TYPES OF. FIGHTING AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES BUT SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF MY PORTFOLIO ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I WILL POINT BACK TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN THE ROLE OF INVESTMENTS ARE PROBABLY INVESTMENTS. YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF US WAS BY FAR HAVE TO COME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THOSE INVESTMENTS GET COORDINATED INTENSE AND DIRECTED THROUGH THE ROLE OF THE OF THE STATE AND- IN PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. OTHERS BEEN OVER SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TODAY AND THAT THE REFORMS THAT I WAS SUGGESTING IN MY REMARKS COULD ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THE AROUND REVENUE GOING TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. BONTA BRIDGE PARTY ABOUT THAT FURTHER OFF SO I THINK I'M- I'M I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE OUTAGES ON THE JACKET SUCH ABOUT HOW TO CHANNEL THOSE- INVESTMENTS SUCH AS THE ADDRESS EVERY TYPE OF COMMUNITY WHERE THERE IS AREN'T OBVIOUS UPPER MIDDLE INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE ADVANTAGES OF A PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXISTING ALREADY- SO LET ME NOT DEFER. THE CATHERINE. THANK DOLLARS. I'M SO FIRST JUST TO A FIRM I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SAID ENOUGH NOT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO OWN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE OR REALISTIC MODEL THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR. IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY IT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY AND IT'S NOT PREFERRED BY EVERYBODY- IT IS PART OF WHAT I SPOKE TO AND I WAS JUST MENTIONED IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE TAILORED TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- WE HAVE A LOT OF FARMWORKERS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT UTILIZE THINGS LIKE. VAN PULLS ON THE GREEN RIGHT TERRACE PROGRAM IN THE CITY OF YOUR HONEST BECOME PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND POPULAR. THERE'S CARD SURE AND RIGHT SURE OPPORTUNITIES WE NEED MORE BUS AND TRANSIT FOR WHERE THERE IS- COMPACT AND DENSE ENOUGH DEVELOPMENT TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT. AND I THINK PARTICULARLY WHAT I WOULD EMPHASIZE FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THEIR ROLE IN OVERSEEING TARGETS FOR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IS TRYING TO MOTIVATE THAT- COUPLING RIGHT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TRANSPORTATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEIR BASIC DAILY NEEDS WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON SINGLE PASSENGER VEHICLES. TO GET AROUND. THANK YOU- PROGRAMS WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE- INOTES- RADION GETS A SHOUT OUT MAYOR RADION FROM YOUR ON WITH FOR THE GREEN BAY TITLES PROGRAM THAT HE'S ACTUALLY. EXPANDING IT TO OTHER RURAL PARTS OF- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- AND REALLY I GUESS PLANNING THE SEED. IN POPULATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE STATE WHERE THE THOUGHT PROCESS IS WHAT WILL MAYBE WE CAN MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF OWNING A ELECTRIC VEHICLE WENT WHEN IT'S AFFORDABLE AND WHEN THE POTENTIAL COST OF. ELECTRICITY YOU KNOW- WE ISN'T- THE MAJOR THREAT OF INSTALLING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT YOUR HOME MORE WE SPOKE OF YOU KNOW IN CASE OF OUR REGION MULTI FAMILY HOUSING YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENTS WORK LARGE PORTION OF FOLKS LIVE SOAP BJT ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR AS SPACE WITH YOU ALL APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS TO OUR TO OUR HERE PRESENTING ON ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS I JUST WANT TO BRING INTO THE SPACE I'M LOOKING AT THE- PRESENTATION- REGARDING A- CLEANER FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT SO I REPRESENT. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE WHICH WILL SOON BE FIFTY TWO FOLLOWING REDISTRICTING. WHICH INCLUDES THE COMMUNITIES OF NORTHEAST LA ANY SAUCE ANGELES. OUT WE ARE AT THE HEART I THINK OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES RIGHT OUTSIDE DOWNTOWN LA BUT WE ARE SURROUNDED BY FREEWAYS. SO IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE THE TO THE FIVE THE TEN THE SIXTY THE ONE TEN THE ONE A ONE THE SEVEN TEN. FREEWAYS SIDE THE ONE THIRTY FOUR- I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE WORK RELATED TO THE PORTS. WHEN IT COMES TO TRUCKS- HEAVY FREIGHT MOVING FROM THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES THE PORT OF LONG BEACH- AND MOVING THROUGH MY COMMUNITY TO GET TO THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND SO WE WERE VERY- COMMITTED TO PASSING A BE SEVEN NINE FOR THE CLIMATE JOBS IN EQUITY ACT. WHICH IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AND FINALLY ALIGNS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD TO COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO AND SHARE DATA AND INFORMATION. RELATED TO US SOMETHING THAT WE OFTEN MISS IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THOSE THAT THE CONVERSATION AN INCLUSION OF WORKERS. AND SO. I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THIS BILL WORKS. SO THAT ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY THAT. CALIFORNIA IS PUTTING INTO POCKETS FOR. A GREEN CLEAN TRUCKS FOR- MAKING IT AFFORDABLE TO WORKERS MOST OF WHOM ARE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF WHO ARE MISCLASSIFIED TRUCK DRIVERS. AND SO THEREFORE THEY DON'T QUALIFY OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE PUTTING AT THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO- CHANGE EIGHTY- YOU KNOW A GAS DRIVEN TRUCK INTO A MORE CLEANER VEHICLE. AND SO I WONDER IF YOU CAN EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW. THE JOB IN THE WORK FORCE RELATED TO A CLEANER FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT ACTUALLY PLAYS A ROLE IN THE REDUCTION. OF EMISSIONS AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE DOING THE WORK NECESSARY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT YES. UP THE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND WE ARE PUTTING. MONEY INTO POTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE TRANSITION TO OCCUR. BUT THEN HOW DOES THE TO THE TRANSITION. ACTUALLY OCCUR. WHEN THE WORKERS THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS AND THE COMPANIES OR CORPORATIONS THAT EMPLOY THEM AS CLASSIFY THEM AND THEN RAKE IN THE PROFITS FOR. THOSE VEHICLES FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT BILL AND WE HAVE A AND M. THE GOVERNOR DID APPROVE OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL SO IT'S PENDING BEFORE- THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF FINDING OUR- OUR WORK ON THAT BILL AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO. HAVING THAT APPROVED IN MOVING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTATION- AND- YOU KNOW YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I MEAN SO MANY OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT IS DONE BY. INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS ARE VERY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS- AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID LAST- FALL WHEN WE ADOPTED OUR- FUNDING PLAN. IS WE REALLY ARE ORIENTING OUR AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS MORE TOWARDS THOSE SMALLER- OPERATOR SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS AND TO HIM TO MAKE A TRANSITION TO A CLEANER VEHICLE AND SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW BEST TO- TO SUPPORT THAT TRANSMIT TRANSITION FOR SMALLER OPERATORS AND- AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES- TO PRIORITIZE WORK IN THOSE- ALONG THIS RECORDERS IN THIS PART COMMUNITIES- HEY. DEALING WITH YOU KNOW SO. PROVIDING LEGAL SUPPORT FOR SOUTH COAST INDIRECT SOURCE RULE- DEFENSE IN THE COURTS- AND REALLY WORKING ON STRATEGIES THAT WILL BENEFIT THOSE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU- YES GARCIA UGH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOUR COMMENT ON- OR YOUR PRESENTATION ON A JUSTICE AND FOR WORK AND FOR PEOPLE RIGHT I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE ALIGNMENT FALLS IN A LOT OF THOSE MISCLASSIFIED OF SMALL BUSINESS OPERATORS TRUCK OPERATORS LIVE IN THESE VERY COMMUNITIES AND SO I WANT TO WORK I THINK WE'RE ALL FOCUSED ON FIGURING OUT. CLIMATE JUSTICE EQUITY NOT ONLY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT BUT FOR THE VERY WORKERS THAT ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION IN TERMS OF- THE PORT GOODS MOVEMENT FREIGHT- OBVIOUSLY THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES IS THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN. THE ENTIRE NATION IF NOT THE WORLD AND IT RUNS THROUGH OF OUR ENTIRE STATE AND THE NATION AND SO I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T QUITE FLUSHED OUT OF THAT CERTAINLY ALIGNS CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND FAMILIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU. BUT I JUST BRIEFLY RESPOND AS WELL YEAH THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I THINK THAT THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED ON SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THE TRUCK RULES AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ON THE PLAN TO TRY TO HELP CLEAN UP SOME OF THE POLLUTION AROUND THE PORT OF STOCKTON. THAT'S DEFINITELY AN ADVANCEMENT THAT WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW DOES THIS ALIGN WITH WORKERS SO JUST AGAIN TO WAYS THAT THEIR AGENCIES OPERATE THAT WERE LOOKING TO IMPROVE AT LEAST IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IS TRANSFORMING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FROM A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE EQUITY ORIENTED AND MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS INSTEAD OF THE VERY LARGE FLEETS THAT HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK FOR THEM- AND FRANKLY TO MEET OUR CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AND- ENDS TO ANY INCENTIVE MONEY FOR NATURAL GAS TRUCKS WE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING. FULLY ELECTRIC WORK WHEREVER POSSIBLE SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MEASURES THAT WERE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT- KEEPING WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IN MIND. AND CAN I JUST ADD TO THAT I JUST KIND OF ONE I JUST WANT TO LIFT UP SOME OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT- PILOT PROGRAMS THAT. THE STATE HAS FUNDED AND THAT REALLY ARE HELPING US LEARN ABOUT WAYS TO IMPROVE GOODS MOVEMENT- WE HAVE. PROGRAMS THAT. THAT THAT- LOOK AT. YOU KNOW. MOVING GOODS FROM PORTS TO THE INLAND WAREHOUSES. BOTH USING ELECTRIC TRACKS AND THEN ALSO USING FUEL CELL- HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS YOU KNOW BOTH ZERO EMISSION. OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL REALLY- AT YOU KNOW ADDRESS THAT THE IMPACTS. ON THOSE COMMUNITIES AND MAKE THAT. GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR A CLEANER SECTOR I JUST HAVE. MAYBE TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND- BUT WE WILL TRY TO WRAP UP IF. WE SHOULD TAKE YOUR TIME I JUST WANTED TO- THAT CHAIR RANDOLPH I JUST WANTED TO- REITERATE- APPOINT THE VICE CHAIR BACKER MADE- ACCORDING TO THE R. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN ORDER TO MEET OUR- SB THIRTY TWO GOAL OF REDUCING. OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 40% BY TWENTY THIRTY THE ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE. OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 4% A YEAR. AND YET YOU KNOW EVEN WITH THE PANDEMIC SLOWDOWN- IT'S I KNOW YOU INDICATED EARLIER THAT- THAT- THAT- WE ONLY HAVE ESTIMATED- EMISSIONS DATA AT THIS POINT BUT- IT IT APPEARS THAT WE'RE- IN THE RANGE OF A- NINETEEN SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT ONLY YOU KNOW A PANDEMIC. A SLOWDOWN BUT IT'S 202-020-2120 TWENTY TWO- A 2% REDUCTION BELOW THE TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS. SO IT IT IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THE DATA SEEMS TO SUGGEST. THAT CLEARLY WERE NOT ON A TRAJECTORY TO MEET OUR TWENTY. THIRTY SB THIRTY TWO GOAL- I KNOW YOU INDICATED EARLIER THAT- THAT DATE IS STILL PRELIMINARY BUT ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE. CAN YOU GIVE US A PREVIEW OF SUMMER RECKLESS TURNAROUND IN TERMS OF THE TRAJECTORY OF- OF BECAUSE IT IT APPEARS THEY WERE WE CLEARLY ARE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET- A TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THE THAT THE JURY STILL OUT ON THAT BECAUSE WE DO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE INCREASED IN STRINGENCY STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE EVERYTHING FROM CAP AND TRADE INCREASES STRINGENCY RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD INCREASE IN STRINGENCY. LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. RATE SO LIKE THE EVENING YOU KNOW WE NEED TIME TO SEE HOW THAT'S WORKING THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND WHAT EFFECT THAT WILL BE AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT THE INVENTORY. NUMBERS YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL INVENTORY NUMBERS EVERY YEAR- AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY WILL TELL US KIND F. YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING AND WHERE WE'RE GOING. OKAY AND MY LAST QUESTION AT THIS POINT IS- THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE I IMAC REPORT- RECOMMENDED- THAT THE UPCOMING SCOPING PLAN- MODEL OR PROVIDE BASELINE EMISSIONS SCENARIO- A% BASELINE EMISSION SCENARIO THAT MODELS THE EFFECT OF NON CAP AND TRADE POLICIES SO THAT TO. YOU KNOW IF THAT WOULD INFORM WHAT- WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO- IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL ACTIONS TO DO TO ACHIEVE THESE. AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS THAT WE HAVE SAID WILL BE UPCOMING- SCOPING PLAN INCLUDE A SUCH A- BASELINE EMISSION SCENARIO. WE DO WE WILL IN THE AM IN THE DRAFT PROVIDED A BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO AND THEN WE WILL BEMOVING ON FROM THERE IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING THE PROGRAMS AND THEIR PRODUCTIONS WE EXPECT TO SEE SO THEY'LL BE A LOT OF ROBUST ANALYSIS IN THE DRAFT THAT WILL BE COMING OUT. OKAY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS WHEN WILL WE KNOW THE INVENTORIES YOU SEE IT'S KIND OF AT THE ESTIMATED BATES JUST WIPED CLEAR. OH GOSH IS THERE'S A WHOLE I MEAN BASICALLY WE GET A BUNCH OF REPORTED INFORMATION- AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LAG YOU KNOW WE GET THE REPORTED INFORMATION AND THEN WE RECEIVE IT AND THEN YOU KNOW WE KIND OF. PUT IT TOGETHER AND IN THE INVENTORY NUMBERS AND THEN WE RELEASE IT AND THERE'S A SPECIFIC TIMELINE- AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT I'VE TAUGHT MY HEAD I AM HAPPY TO HAVE STAFF GET THAT TWO YEAR. OKAY GREAT. WE'LL GET WELL JUST A MINUTE AGAIN THANK THE CHAIR- FOR THIS THIS HEARING AGES TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS ON CAP AND TRADE AND WE DISCUSSES WELL AND I THINK.

AND WHETHER THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE MULTI FAMILY WITH AN- INTRODUCTION WELCOME NEIGHBORHOODS OF OTHER WORK WORK LOOKING AT A LOT OF THAT THIS YEAR THIS CLIMATE EQUITY TRUST- THAT WAS JUST INTRODUCED. TO TAKE. UP THINGS LIKE WILDFIRE OUT OF RATES. AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE SO WE'RE NOT YEARS WE DECREASE ELECTRICITY RATES WE CAN. WHICH IS VERY REGRESSIVE TAX AND WE CAN INCREASE. IN THE INCREASE DECARBONISATION MORE QUICKLY. ALL THINGS YOU KNOW THAT WERE WORKING ON OF THIS YEAR- AND- I'M WILL BE IMPORTANT PARTS WORK ALSO THANK YOU. THE YOU. ANY OTHER CALL OUR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THING NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME IN YOUR TESTIMONY WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT- THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED IF IF I NEED TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS VERGE WELSH WITH THE CALIFORNIA CARBON CAPTURE COALITION- WERE- BUSINESS LABOR COALITION COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT- CCS TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE OF- KEY PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO REACH OUR COMMON GOALS IN CALIFORNIA- AND GREAT CONVERSATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- THE FOCUS ON BOTH THE SCOPING PLAN IN MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE- ANALYSIS IS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLANNING ON. HAVING A MORE FOCUSED DISCUSSION AROUND THE TOPIC SO WE'LL DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS WELL- BUT I DID JUST WANT TO SAY- TODAY- THE REALITY IS WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT CCS TECHNOLOGY AND THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT A THE CONCLUSION THAT- THE- THE AIRBOARD REACHED IN A VACUUM. OF COURSE- AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE WELL AWARE- THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF VIRTUALLY EVERY CREDIBLE EXPERT ANALYSIS THE I. P. C. THE I. A. CALIFORNIA FOCUSED ANALYSIS FROM STANFORD AND MARK LIVERMORE AMONG OTHERS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THESE TECHNOLOGIES. TO ACHIEVE OUR CARBON GOALS AND SO- WHAT WE NEED IN THIS STATE IS. TO HAVE LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER APPROACHES TO REDUCE POLLUTION OR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS A POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ON A SCALE AND A PACE THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA ENABLE THEM TO BE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS- IN CALIFORNIA AND SO AS YOU ALLUDED TO MISTER CHAIR THERE THERE IS A ROBUST CONVERSATION- THAT IS GOING ON IT WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE I AM VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS ON ON THIS IS THE COMMITTEE AS WELL- BUT I DID JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT- FOR YOU- THAT THE MATH AND THE SCIENCE ARE CLEAR HERE THAT C. C. U. S. IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART. OF OUR APPROACH SO THANKS VERY MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU ALL. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- YOU CAN HEAR ME. SELECT A CAITLYN REDNER CENTER- WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND- I ALSO SIT ON THE MAC AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT BUT I'M HERE SOLELY AS ETF AT THE MOMENT- I'M REALLY PLEASED TO HEAR FROM CHAIR RANDALL TODAY THAT CARB IS PLANNING TO- ESTIMATE THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE IN THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL OF OUR EXISTING CLIMATE POLICIES AS WE CHART A PATH TO TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND- SO THAT'S THAT'S EXCITING TO HEAR AND I WOULD ADD THAT. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF CAP AND TRADE WHATEVER THAT MAGIC PERCENTAGE NUMBER TURNS OUT TO BE IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL THAT THE EMISSIONS CAP. BE REMAIN DESIGNED AS AN EMISSIONS BACKSTOPS- YOU KNOW THIS WAS SET OUT IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MEAN AS WAS DISCUSSED HERE TODAY THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES WITH MODELING AND MODELING ASSUMPTIONS AND PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND THAT THAT JUST SORT OF COMES WITH THE TERRITORY. AND WE NEED TO MINIMIZE THOSE BUT IF WE HAVE A WELL DESIGNED EMISSIONS CAP WE HAVE A CREDIBLE BACKSTOPS THEY CAN PROVIDE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CERTAINTY OF MEETING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS- SO TO THAT END. I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD- TO UNDERTAKE A RULEMAKING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. FOR CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM'S AMBITION REFLECTS OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND IS DESIGNED TO BE THAT BACKSTOPS WHO WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET- TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. AND AS CHAIR RANDALL SAID YOU KNOW MEETING AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONSAFTER THAT- I MEAN THIS OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE AN OPEN AND DELIBERATIVE RULEMAKING PROCESS- AND AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE CARD TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE- AYE YOU MAC N. E. JACK RECOMMENDATIONS- YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT AN EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT RESERVE TODAY. YOU KNOW POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO FREE ALLOCATION TO INDUSTRY- AND THERE'S OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS IN BOTH OF THOSE REPORTS THAT. YOU KNOW SHOULD REALLY BE CONSIDERED IN AN IN AN OPEN AND DELIVERED A PROCESS THAT CARD- BUT AGAIN TO BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO YOU KNOW HIT THE GROUND RUNNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND BE WELL POSITIONED TO HIT OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE SEEING NONE DO WE OPERATED TO HAVE ANYONE- ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE PHONE. YOU FOR PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN THEY OFFER ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FIFTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS NIKHIL KUMAR ALONG WITH THE GOLF GROUP HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTS ARAMBULA- A CARBON NEUTRALITY IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS ON MY LAND MAJOR ISSUES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THEIR I'M- VERY. IMPORTANT OUT THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS LIKE TECHNOLOGY UPDATE EARLIER COULD NOT INFORMATION TO THE. THE INITIAL RESULTS OF STOPPING I AM CALLING. USUALLY THE LAW THAT OF THE USED OR NOT OPTIMISTIC MODELS. THE INTERNATIONAL RESULTAR VICIOUS AT BEST DO NOT PAINT A COMPLETE PICTURE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE OF THE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS IN MAY. AND WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE SCENARIOS AMAL RESULTS WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES. WHAT ARE COMMON THREE YEARS SINCE THE BOARD ON THE SKIPPING PLAN OF THE COUNTRY'S. AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT TO NOTE THAT ADOPTION JOB IMPACT MY WHOLE BE CONSIDERED. IN THE FORTHCOMING. MODELING- FORTY KEY FALL COOL WITH ON THE TABLE IS WE LOOK TO. ARTICLE WE'RE CURRENTLY LIVE- HISTORY WITH- WAR AND OTHER. EVENTUALLY CREATING BUT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF UNPREDICTABILITY AND HOW THE FUTURE WILL WILL PRESENT ITSELF CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE FOR THE NATION TO TRIGGER AND GO ON TO THAT POINT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE FLEXIBILITY IN MARKETS LIKE THE WILL COMPEL STANDARD. AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. FINALLY I WANT TO- MAKE THE STATEMENTS WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE THINGS TO SAY- WE CANNOT INFER TRENDS FROM PRELIMINARY DATA FROM UNVERIFIED EMISSIONS REPORTING- WE OPPOSED. THE INCLUSION OF THE INITIAL ACCORDING. BERMAN AND BUDGET TRAILER BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE PREDICTED THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO THE SPREAD OF THIS NOT SO COMPASSIONATE CONTRACT INCORRECT INCLUSIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. WE WANT TO REMIND THE LEGISLATURE ALSO THAT THE CORE POLICIES REMOVED VARY FROM CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SO CONTINUED INTRODUCTION AND PURSUE THE OF THESE ONE OFF TYPE POLICIES WILL REMAIN VALUE FROM THE PROGRAM AND US REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO INCENTIVIZE THANK FUTURE AT. STATEN WILL FOLLOW UP WITH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS WE GET TO DIVE INTO THIS COMPANY PLAN MARK AND THANK YOU. FOR THE OPTION YOU UNLOCK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S A GOOD LINE SEVENTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HARDY IS THAT ME AND MY IN THE- CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES COMMITTEE THAT IS. AND A- GREAT- WELL I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A NEWBIE TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO HEARINGS. AND JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF GENERAL COMMENTS OF SEEMS TO TIE INTO- THE LIKE LITHIUM MINING. HEARING THAT I WATCHED AWHILE BACK- AND ALTHOUGH LIKE LITHIUM MINING THAT IS APPARENTLY SLATED TO BE HAPPENING DOWN BY THE SOLVENCY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AND THIS SORT OF BROADER. AGENDA IF YOU WILL OF ALL THE ZERO EMISSIONS STUFF- I GUESS I'M A LITTLE PERPLEXED BY IT JUST BECAUSE I'M KIND OF COMING FROM A STANDPOINT OF- BEING A SMALL SCALE FARMER AND IT'S JUST INTERESTING FOR ME TO HEAR ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF YOU KNOW THE HYDROGEN. NOT NONE OF THIS STUFF IS ACTUALLY ZERO EMISSIONS WHEN YOU START TO DIG INTO IT AND SO. THIS FOR ME WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE HEARING BECAUSE IT RATHER RAM LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT THE REALITY OF SOME OF WHAT I WAS CALIFORNIANS ARE DEALING WITH AGAIN OF THE SMALL SCALE FARMER- IT WAS REALLY STRANGE FOR ME TO HEAR. THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE TRUCKERS YOU KNOW WHO YOU FIRED INCIDENTLY BECAUSE THEY WON'T TAKE THE SHOT AND THE SAME WITH THE BACKUP OF THE PORT WORKERS IN LONG BEACH AND LA CONFIG WON'T TAKE THE SHOT. ARE SOMEHOW MAGICALLY JUST GONNA BE LIKE DRIVING AROUND IN LIKE ELECTRIC SEMIS ALL THE SUDDEN THIS HEARING JUST SEEMED REALLY- VERY LIKE PIE IN THE SKY TO ME AGAIN OF SOMEONE WHO'S LIVING ON THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY THEY- CAN GO AND THEIR MANAGERS ALL AROUND. FOR THE NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU WILL GO TO LINE SEVENTY THREE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE CLICK. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MURATSUCHI AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC TODAY. MY NAME IS JOHN BLUE AND I'M CALLING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL EMISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION OR I NEED TO. I NEEDED THE NONPROFIT BUSINESS ORGANIZATION CREATED TO ESTABLISH FUNCTIONAL INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRADING IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE SUPPORT EMISSIONS TRADING THE RESULT IN A REAL AND VERIFIABLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHILE BALANCING ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY. AND SOCIAL EQUITY. THE DOCTOR BIRCH ARE INDICATED IS REMARKS MARKETS DON'T WORK WELL WITH REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY PROGRAM BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY WHAT DO A GREAT DEAL TO ADDRESS UNSERVED AND REMOVE SOME OF THE WORRY ABOUT BANK ALLOWANCE. AND WE WOULD ESPECIALLY WELCOME CLARIFICATION ON CARDS VIEW ON THE ROLE FOR CAP AND TRADE BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY DURING THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS. I BELIEVE THE CAR ALREADY HAS THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO USE CAP AND TRADE AS A LEADING POLICY FOR ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY TO USE TOO MANY COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES AND TOP DOWN COMMAND AND CONTROL REGULATIONS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR MANY REASONS. INCLUDING THAT THEY'RE OFTEN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. FOR EXAMPLE A RECENT ALEJO REPORT CALCULATES THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBS LOCAL SOURCE PROGRAM FOR FROM THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED THANK YOU YOUR MARIO WHAT IN YOUR RECORD PROGRAM. LAST COMMENT OKAY AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED. YEAH CALIFORNIA IS ONLY A TINY PORTION OF THE OVERALL GLOBAL EMISSIONS OUR GREATEST OPPORTUNITY IS LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS MORE REPLICABLE BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS THANK YOU IF WE ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY IN EXPENSE. NEXT CALLER PLEASE. YOU WILL GO TO LINE SEVENTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND FROM MEMBERS MY NAME IS RELAXED. AND I RIVER THAT YOU TO BRADLEY FOR U. S. SENATE. AND I'M CALLING BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE INNOVATION IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS OUT THERE THE WARRIORS TRYING TO WORK BETTER TRYING TO REDUCE HARMFUL EMISSIONS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. BY REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT DEGREE DAY ALL OF THE STORE COUNTY. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN CARDIFF. AS WITH THE WAS DESCRIBED. ROBERT RIVAS SPEAKER AND AS USUAL THIS OUT. I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT WITH THE GREEN NEW DEAL IT WILL DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CALIFORNIANS WITH THE VERY. INDEPENDENT BUT ARE DISADVANTAGED. SO ARE. THE PEOPLE THAT WILL HAVE PRIVILEGED POSITIONS ONLY BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT WHILE THE REST OF US WILL HAVE TO WRITE A BOOK. REALLY THE. OUR GOAL FAIR TO YOU ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SHOULD BE BE THE FOCUS ON BEING FAIR AND HAVING ACCORDING ACCORDING AT THE AFFABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SO I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD NOT THE CARD.

MY COMMENTS ARE DIRECTED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I'D LIKE TO CONCEPTION TO ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT ONE OF THE SPEAKERS AT THE CAPITAL PROGRAM INCREASES LOCAL AIR POLLUTION BY DESIGN WHICH DID POINT OUT THAT THAT WAS CONTRARY TO FINDINGS THE RECENTLY RELEASED A WE HEART STUDY WHICH FOUND GREAT. THIS YEAR IT REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM FACILITIES THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT THE COLOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DELTA CONTRADICTS THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE GOT IT BY THE UC SANTA BARBARA STUDY ON THIS TOPIC. FINALLY DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT TO DISPATCH COMMUNITIES THE CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE BOND WHICH IS FUNDED SOLELY. WITH CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS. THESE TWENTY TWENTY TWO I REPORT THAT BUT FIVE PROJECTS FUND WITH TWO POINT ONE BILL DOLLARS IN CAPITAL GROSS BETWEEN TWENTY ONE. TO ONE BILLION WHICH WAS TO DISPATCH.

THE RECENT SCOPING PLAN NOW BROADLY SPEAKING THAT. CALIFORNIA MUST INNOVATE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. PART OF THAT INNOVATION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND USE A CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE UTILIZED EVERY AVAILABLE TOOL. IN THE TOOLBOX TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS MINIMIZE COSTS AND CARBON EMISSION LEAKAGE. STATUTE ALSO MANDATES THAT THESE CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALL THE PEOPLE AT THE GAPS. SO SEVERAL OF THE SCOPING PLAN ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT FEASIBLE THESE ARE THE ALTERNATE CENTER MAXIMIZING COST AT ALL SO EMISSIONS LEAKAGE. AND SHUTTING DOWN ENTIRE SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SHOULD BE CONCERNING SINCE THESE ARE THE INDUSTRY'S THE EDITORS OF THE INVESTOR CAN ALREADY BE.
