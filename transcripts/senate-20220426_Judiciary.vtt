AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE REAL

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.004
QUESTION WITH THIS BILL IS USING

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:55.506
A COURT THE BEST WAY TO GET

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:57.909

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.150
SORT OF DEPRESSION AND I WAS

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:08.052
LUCKY AT THAT EARLY STAGE IN MY

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.987
EXPERIENCE WITH MY DISABILITY.

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:12.023
THAT I HAD JUST GOTTEN MARRIED

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:12.824
TO THE RIGHT PERSON WE'RE STILL

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.759
MARRIED SHE HELPED ME GET ON A

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.894
PATH TO RECOVERY AND I'VE BEEN

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:17.962
ABLE TO HAVE A CAREER AS AN

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.797
ATTORNEY. AT WHEN I WAS IN

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.965
WASHINGTON DC I WAS THE

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.600
DISABILITY POLICY DIRECTOR FOR

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.736
SENATOR TOM HARKIN ON THE U. S.

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:25.903
SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH

EDUCATION LABOR AND PENSIONS.

00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:28.906
AND I'VE RAISED TWO CHILDREN

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:30.541
WITH MY WIFE. NONE OF THIS

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.143
WOULD'VE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ME IF

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.312
I DIDN'T LEARN EARLY HOW TO MAKE

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.147
DECISIONS FOR MYSELF HOW TO GET

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:38.149
CARE THAT WAS GOING TO WORK FOR

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:39.584
ME AND HOW TO MANAGE MY SYMPTOMS

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.519
SO THAT I COULD ACCOMPLISH MY

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:42.487
GOALS. SO THE QUESTION FOR

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:43.321
PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:44.689
SPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:46.524
THE NEW DIAGNOSIS IS WHAT'S

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:48.292
GOING TO WORK BEST FOR THEM. WE

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.661
DON'T BELIEVE THAT FORCED CARER

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:52.130
WORKS WELL FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.564
MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES AND

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.832
WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S A

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:56.401
GOOD EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.969

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.105
INVOLVE FORCED CARE SO THE

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.840
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IN

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:04.642
OPPOSITION IS. HOW DO YOU HAVE A

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:09.614
COURT ORDERED CARE PLAN. WITHOUT

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.149

EXPLAIN. SAYS YOU CAN ORDER

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:16.587

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:17.688
ORDER HOUSING HOW ARE WE GOING

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:20.024
TO ENSURE. THAT THE HOUSING AND

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.192
PRIORITIZE THE LAST POINT I WANT

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:22.693

HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN TO THE

HOSPITALIZED UNDER FIFTY ONE

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.108
FIFTY. MY MOTHER CAME FROM

ALL ABOUT IT WAS NEEDING HELP

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:37.902

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.804

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.439
EMOTIONALLY AND NOT GETTING MY

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:43.741
NEEDS MET. EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.309
THAT CB TEA IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.478
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. FOR MANY

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.946

AND THAT IS YET ANOTHER

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.338
DISPARITY. MY FEAR IS THAT CARE

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:15.472

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.707

STRUCTURED- THIS BILL ISN'T VERY

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.605
EARLY FORM AND I KNOW IT'S GOING

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:59.676

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:12.088
CHANGES SAYS QUOTE THIS IS ONE

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:16.760

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:46.616
WHITE PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:50.053
RIGHTS SO THERE'S THAT- BUT-

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.155
COLLABORATIVE COURTS I'M I'M I'M

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:53.623
WONDERING BECAUSE I WAS THINKING

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.492
ABOUT. CHAPTER NINE WHICH IS

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.693
ONLY BY WHITE HOUSE HE COULD

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.395
THINK ABOUT BANKRUPTCY MUNICIPAL

00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:01.231
BANKRUPTCIES BECAUSE- THE REASON

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.999
IS THAT JUDGES CAN'T ORDER

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.868
ANYTHING. IF THEY CAN'T NOT

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:07.003
UNLIKE A CHAPTER SEVEN OR

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.004
THIRTEEN ELEVEN THEY CAN SAY YOU

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.973
DID OR DO THIS AND YOU CREDITORS

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.875
ARE FOUND IT'S ALL COLLABORATION

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:14.577
THEY HAVE TO HAVE AGREEMENT WITH

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.845
PEOPLE NIGHT AND I WAS THINKING.

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:17.881
THOSE COURTS DO THAT FOR

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.749
MUNICIPALITIES WHEN THEY COME IN

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.918
BEFORE THEM AND THEY TRY TO WORK

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.953
OUT THESE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ON

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.622
WHAT'S THE BEST PLAN FOR THAT

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:28.058
CITY TO REORGANIZE TO DEBTS AND

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.859
FOR CREDITORS TO TAKE A HAIR CUT

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.461
SO THE- JUDGE MANLEY SAID A

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:32.762
BUNCH OF WORK IN COLLABORATIVE

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.097
COURTS AND I'M WONDERING YOU

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.633
KNOW WHY WE- CAN'T ORDER.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.501
HOUSING AND WE CAN'T ORDER

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:40.136
MEDICATION THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:42.205
THAT HOUSING ADVOCATES AND THE

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:45.108
MEDICAL- FOLKS ARE THAT-

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.676
PSYCHIATRISTS ARE NOT IN THE

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.745
ROOM WHEN THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:50.780
GOING ON AND I WAS WONDERING.

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:52.582
HOW DOES HE ENVISION THE

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:54.684
EFFECTIVENESS IF IT WERE IF THE

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.586
GOAL IS TO HIT SEVEN TO TWELVE

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.121
THOUSAND. EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:00.924
ORDER PEOPLE TO THIS TREATMENT.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.059
YES ORDER SET THEM UP WITH THE

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:05.228
DISCUSSION I GUESS I'M I DON'T

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:07.063
KNOW I'M NOT A JUDGE BUT I WAS

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.331
WONDERING IF THE JUDGE KIDS

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:10.433
COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA OF HOW

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.702
THIS MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL HEARD

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.204
HOW IT MIGHT NOT BE SAFE FOR

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.907
MAYBE. THE CHAIR COULD TELL US

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:20.877
HOW BAD. LACK OF. POWER TO ORDER

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.879
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING MIGHT

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:26.583
ACTUALLY PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:28.418
- I WILL LET THE EXPERTS ANSWER

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.520
THE QUESTION- MISTER DOCTOR

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:32.489
GALLEY IS HERE AND I THINK JUDGE

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.357
MANLEY IS STILL ON THE PHONE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:37.927
BUT- THIS IS. THE A COUSIN TO

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:42.098
THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS- THE-

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:45.702
OUTCOME FOR THE RECORD IS THE

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:46.936
WORST CASE OUTCOME IS A

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:48.071
CONSERVATORSHIP WHERE'S AND

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.006
COLLABORATIVE COURTS YOU MAY END

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.074

THE COURT CANNOT ORDER

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:02.986
INCARCERATION BUT THE COURT CAN

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:05.255
FOR EXAMPLE- SUPERVISE IN ORDER

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.157
SOME OF THE ANCILLARY SERVICES

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:09.025
THAT SUPPORT. THE CARE COURTS SO

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.794

THAT'S NOT REALLY FLESHED OUT IS

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:04.380
THAT IF SOMEBODY IS

PEOPLE HAVEN'T REACHED THAT

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.123
INCAPACITATION SO THERE- THERE

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.192
IF THEY BREACH IT THEN WE HAVE

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:16.793
SOME CONSTITUTIONAL TRIGGERS

GOING TO BE A AS OF THE WORK IN

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:10.573
PROGRESS THAT I LOOK FOR TO

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:11.206
LEANING IN ON- REPRESENTING A

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.174
VERY LARGE CITY THE SECOND

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.009
LARGEST CITY IN L. A. COUNTY

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.811
LONG BEACH THAT HAS ITS OWN

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.112
HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ALSO- MANY

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:19.548
SOUTHEAST CITIES- IN AND AROUND

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.318
ONE LOS ANGELES. SO HAVE A QUICK

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.852
COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS AND

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.188
THE ONE FIVE LOTS OF- OF COURSE

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:27.256
CONCERNS BROUGHT BROUGHT BY THE

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.657
OPPOSITION AND IN VARIOUS

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.159
DEGREES BUT WANTED OF WHICH IS

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:32.328
THE PRESUMPTION CONCERN ON NON

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.463
COMPLIANCE AND I JUST WANT TO

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:36.165
KNOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.600
AND THEN SECONDLY BROUGHT UP

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.568
ANOTHER VALID CONCERN NOT

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.236
NECESSARILY WITHIN THE- YOU KNOW

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:42.871
PER VIEW LET'S SAY OF THE

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.873
JUDICIARY BUT- THE RACIAL

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.275
INEQUITY CONCERNS BECAUSE THOSE

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:49.445
ARE JUST CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY-

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.012
UNFORTUNATELY THE DATA SHOWS

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.714
THAT. THERE MAY BE MORE

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.450
MISDIAGNOSIS- FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA-

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.552
PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS FOR FOLKS

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:58.420
THAT IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

01:10:58.487 --> 01:10:59.722
HOW WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.523
THROUGH THAT AND I THINK IT THE

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.925
LEAST THIS WOULD LIFT UP THOSE

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.793
ISSUES SO WE CAN DISCUSS THEM

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:09.999
GREATER- IN A GREATER. WAY DR

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.867
KELLY WILL TO THIS BUT I JUST

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:15.037
ALL. THE TO GO BACK TO THE ISSUE

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.339
OF THE DIAGNOSIS THAT'S ME

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.508
OFTENTIMES AT THIS LEVEL THE

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.710
GOAL IS IN AGAIN THE MONEY WE

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.113
PUT IN FOR- TO STAND UP A WHOLE

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.748
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLATFORM FOR

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.750
CHILDREN ZERO TO TWENTY SIX TO

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:28.984
BE ABLE TO GET AN EVALUATION.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.753
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WILL

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.521
ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING ISSUES

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:33.956
THE- OF RACIAL EQUITY THIS IS

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:36.025
NOT A NEW ISSUE THIS IS NOT AN

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.126
ISSUE THAT WE'RE SURPRISED THAT

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.828
WE SEE ON THE STREETS THIS IS AN

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.797
ISSUE OF ACCESS AND EQUITY OVER

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.265
GENERATIONS. AND SO THE EARLIER

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:44.333
THAT WE START INTERVENTION AND

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.503
TREATMENTS THE LESS OF THAT

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.637
DISPARITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:52.808
SEE. YEAH- LET ME SAY A COUPLE

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.743
THINGS FIRST THANK YOU FOR

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.311
REALLY LIFTING UP THE WORK THAT

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:58.414
WE NEED TO DO FURTHER UPSTREAM

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.782
YOU CANNOT SEE CARE COURT IN

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.417
ISOLATION IF ALL OF THE OTHER

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.485
WORK. THAT IS HAPPENING LARGELY

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.020
BY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:07.556
CLOSELY WITHIN COMMUNITIES. THE

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:09.391
FUNDING COMES THROUGH THE STATE

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.527
THE LEGISLATURE ME TO SAY OTHER

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:14.463
FUNDING FOR MEDIC. CADE SERVICES

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.498
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THERE IS A

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:19.001
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT YET. WE

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.136
HAVE SUCH A CHALLENGE AND IT WAS

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:21.970
EXACERBATED DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.039
BUT IF YOU TRY. TO LOOK AT CARE

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.241
COURT IN ISOLATION OF EVERYTHING

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.143
YOU WILL GET A COMPLETE OR AN

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.279
INCOMPLETE PICTURE. IMMEDIATELY

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.414
THAT IS I THINK ONE POINT. THE

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.616
SECOND THING IS MY EXPERIENCE IN

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.819
THE SPACE AND L. A. COUNTY. OUR

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.887
TEAM. ARE LARGELY THROUGH

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.956
WORKING WITH DIVERSION PROGRAMS

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.524
WORKING WITH COURTS. THAT

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.893
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.929
SYSTEM WE HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.630
HAS BECOME THE PLACE WHERE SO

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.767
MANY PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.469
ILLNESS GET. YOURS AGO WHEN I

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:54.703
MET JUDGES AND ONLY. THEY WOULD

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.606
SAY A FULL 30% OF MY DOCKET. IS

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:59.775
INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.744
ISSUES BUT THAT WAS WIDESPREAD

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.145
EVERY COURT THROUGHOUT THAT

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.880
LARGE COUNTY I'M SURE THAT

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.982
SHARED ACROSS THE STATE. JUDGE

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.183
MERELY WE'RE HERE IF OU COULD

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.120
VERIFY THAT BUT THE EXPECTATION.

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:13.922
THAT ARE SO MANY INDIVIDUALS

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.258
TODAY. WHO ARE EITHER

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:19.194
MISDIAGNOSED MISLABELED OR A

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:21.630
PROPERLY DIAGNOSED ONLY AFTER

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:22.798
THEY ENCOUNTER THE CRIMINAL

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.967
SYSTEM. END UP IN OUR JAILS AND

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:27.936
PRISONS AND TO GO UPSTREAM FOR

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.905
THAT POPULATION. OFFERS

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.507
SOMETHING LIKE THE CHARACTER

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.109
MODEL CIVIL PROCESS ONE THAT

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.211
LOOKS AT ENGAGEMENT FIRST LOOKS

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:38.580
AT. REALLY BUILDING A

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:39.348
COLLABORATIVE CARE PLAN

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.650
INITIALLY. BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.118
ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:44.787
EVERYONE. AND SOME PEOPLE WILL

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.622
NEED THE SUPPORT NOT JUST FOR

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.323
THEM BUT TO MAKE SURE THE

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.958
SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.961
FUNDED TO SUPPORT THEM. ARE ABLE

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:53.829
TO COLLABORATE AND COMPLETE A

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:56.265
PLAN. THERE ARE DEEP INEQUITIES

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:59.034
IN OUR SYSTEM. WE ARE AWARE OF

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.969
THOSE WE DO A LOT IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:03.338
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEM YET WE

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:07.042
SEE THEM PERSISTING. CONTINUE WE

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.844
NEED A NEW WAY. CARE CORD ISN'T

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:09.978
IGN TO THOSE THERE WILL BE

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.347
INVESTMENTS IN EVALUATION AND A

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.316
COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE PAY

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:17.019
ATTENTION TO THOSE ISSUES BUT

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.754
THE PRESENCE OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.990
CANNOT BECOME OUR EXCUSE TO NOT

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.826
TO TRY TO DO MORE WE NEED TO DO

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:26.061
BUT- THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WE

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.130
NEED TO WORK ON IMPROVING THOSE

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:28.764
ISSUES ADDRESSING THEM. THROUGH

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.132
THE INVESTMENTS I MENTIONED IN

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.668
MAKING SURE. THAT THE SUPPORTER

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:35.804
ROLE WHICH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:38.974
THIS PLAN. REFLECTS AND SUPPORTS

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.042
THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER THEY MAY

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.711
BE. AND UNDERSTANDS THEIR WISHES

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:45.314
OVERTIME AND COMMUNICATES THOSE

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.949
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PART

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.418
OF THE CARE PLAN SO I THINK

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.286
THOSE PIECES NEVER A PERFECT

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.020

COMMITMENT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.032

THE CARE CORE PROCESS LEAD OVER

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.631
THE COURSE OF OUR MAMA INDEED

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:36.965
NOT AGGRESSIVE BUT CERTAINLY

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.767
CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT THERE IS

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:41.603
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING PEOPLE

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.171

DELIVER A FULL SUITE OF SERVICES

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.608
THAT WE KNOW ARE EVIDENCE BASED

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.277
AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:51.280
WOULD THAT OUR IS NOT ENOUGH WE

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:52.514
KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.483
RETURN TO SETTINGS WHERE THEY

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:56.518
WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER AND

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:59.288
DECOMPENSATED AND THAT IDEA THAT

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.956

MODEL IF NOT EFFECTIVE SHOULDN'T

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.995
BE IGNORED AND SHOULD BE USED IN

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:08.664
THE CASE THAT SOMEBODY COMES

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.532
AGAIN TO THE HOSPITAL OR IS IN

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.935
ANOTHER SETTING AND THIS IDEA

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:16.004
THAT- WE HAVE TO START FROM

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.773
SCRATCH EVERY IME. DOESN'T

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.308
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THEN WE

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:20.976
HAVE O TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PRIOR

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.045
ATTEMPTS IN PRIOR WORK TO MAKE

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.013

TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE-

01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:04.191
AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE- WORKED

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:05.259

ON. THANK YOU. DISCOVER THANK

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:17.471
YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:18.739
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:20.441
FIND A AN APPROPRIATE TIME

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:22.610
PERIOD IN WHICH THE LANDLORD

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.345
WOULD NOT A VET. IF THEY HAVE

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.647
RECEIVED GRANT DOLLARS- WE

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.716
TALKED ABOUT THIS JUST A FEW

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:31.085
DAYS BEFORE THE ANALYSIS NEED TO

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:33.154
BE COMPLETE SO WE ARE WORKING

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.322
WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE WHAT.

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:37.424
AMOUNT OF TIME IS FAIR WITH

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.126
OBVIOUSLY THE SITUATION HERE WE

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:41.028
HAVE A TENANT WHO ABSOLUTELY

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:44.431
REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE- DIDN'T

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:47.368
TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS ABILITY

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:48.769
SO WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.938
DISAGREEMENT ON HOW LONG THAT

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.406
CAN CONTINUE TO STAY. SO WE WILL

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.008
WORK OUT THAT TIME PERIOD THOUGH

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:56.844
AND THAT IS PART OF THE-

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:58.412
COMMITMENT GOING FORWARD. THANK

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:00.114
YOU Q. AND THEN- ANOTHER

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.615
QUESTION ON THE STATE DAHLER

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:02.917
ASKED BECAUSE I DON'T SEE AN

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.518
APPROPRIATION HERE BUT WHAT DOES

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:06.353
THAT LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT-

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:06.921
WITH. THE DISCUSSIONS BEEN

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:09.223
AROUND THAT- THE DISCUSSIONS

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.824
HAVE BEEN AROUND OBVIOUSLY WOULD

01:37:10.891 --> 01:37:13.394
BE A BUDGET REQUEST- WE HAVE

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.196
DONE SOME INTERNAL POLLING JUST

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.398
AMONGST OUR MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:20.935
WERE ABOUT. A HUNDRED MILLION-

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:23.137
FROM OWNERS AND THESE ARE SMALL

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:23.771
LANDLORDS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE

01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:25.873
PRIORITIZED WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.876
PAID- I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:31.345
US IS. THAT THE STATE MADE IT

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:34.281
VERY EASY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:36.450
STATE THAT THEY COULDN'T PAY THE

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.052
TENANTS COULDN'T PAID SO.

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.454
LEGISLATION OR THE LOSS SAID

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.989
SIMPLY TELL US YOU CAN'T PAY AND

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:43.791
THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.059
THAT THE TENANTS HAVE TO.

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:47.628
DEMONSTRATE THEIR INABILITY OF

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.129
PAY WE'RE FINDING OUT THEY

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:52.032
CAN'T. SO FOR WHAT- SO WE ARE

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:56.770
WORKING. I KNOW WITH THE SENATOR

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:59.440
ON A BUDGET ASK- I WILL SEE WHAT

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:00.107
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WILL ALLOW

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:02.176
THANK YOU MISS CARP ALL RIGHT.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.645
THE QUESTIONS SENT SERVICE ALSO

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.880
SERVED- SENATOR RUSSELL THANK

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:10.417
YOU- MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.820
ABOUT. SOME AS ONE OF THE

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:16.056
WITNESSES SAID- WE ENDED THE

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.559
RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:21.595
PROGRAM AND THAT WAS FOR. OUR

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:26.834
LOWER INCOME- INDIVIDUALS- WE

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.571
ENDED IT AND THEY'RE STILL OUT

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.840
IN OUR STATE. PROBABLY THOUSANDS

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:35.643
OF PEOPLE FOR LOW INCOME WHO

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:38.879
JUST CANNOT PAY THE OUTSTANDING

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:41.949
RENT- A DEBT- IN HERE WE'RE

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:46.820
BEING ASKED TO FULLY REIMBURSE-

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.156
A JUDGMENT AGAINST A TENANT. WHO

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:52.626
HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY- AND

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:55.829
USING DOLLARS YOU KNOW OUR FUND

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:58.599
DOLLARS TO PAY THE JUDGMENT

01:38:58.666 --> 01:38:59.833
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO HAS THE

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.535
ABILITY TO PAY IT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:04.004
THEY'RE LOW INCOME. SO EITHER

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:05.506
HOW YOU RESPOND TO THAT BUT

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:08.475
THAT'S MY ONE OF MY BIGGEST

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:11.545
CONCERNS OF COURSE UP THE WAY

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:13.380
THAT I SEE IT IS THAT WE HAVE

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:16.784
SMALL A RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:19.186
THAT. OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.722
THAT'S THAT REALLY IT'S NOT

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:23.457
THEIR FAULT THAT. THEY'RE IN THE

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:24.358
SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:29.382
INCARCERATION AND

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.050
HOSPITALIZATION NOT SO MANY

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:33.953
PEOPLE FACE. HOWEVER EXPANDING

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:34.987
THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.822
INVOLUNTARILY DETAIN PEOPLE WILL

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:37.957
DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.659
UNDERLYING SOCIETAL CAUSES OF

02:01:39.725 --> 02:01:42.028
THIS CYCLE. WITHOUT REQUIRING

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:43.095
THE STATE AND THE COUNTY IS TO

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.197
ACTUALLY MAKE AVAILABLE HOUSING

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:46.699
AND INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:48.567
PEOPLE NEED UPON DISCHARGE FROM

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:50.236
SHORT TERM LPS HOLDS AND

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:52.271
CONSERVATORSHIP. THE CYCLE WILL

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:54.507
PERSIST. AS DISCUSSED IN OUR

02:01:54.573 --> 02:01:56.275
LETTER A RECENT UCLA STUDY

02:01:56.342 --> 02:01:58.110
SHOWED THAT PLACING ON HOUSE

02:01:58.177 --> 02:02:00.212
PEOPLE ON LPS HOLDS LEADS TO

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:02.048
LONGER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

02:02:02.114 --> 02:02:03.949
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE AT THE TIME

02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:06.318
THAT THEIR WHOLE BEGAN. AND ALSO

02:02:06.385 --> 02:02:08.020
LEADS TO A GREATER THAN 50%

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:09.622
CHANCE THAT A PERSON WILL REMAIN

02:02:09.689 --> 02:02:10.990
ON HOW IS THAT THE TIME OF

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.858
DISCHARGE. I HAVE SEEN THIS

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.660
FIRST HAND IN MY PREVIOUS WORK I

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:16.762
REPRESENTED DOZENS AND DOZENS

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:18.497

HOW IS AND PLACED ON LPS HOLDS

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.234
WITH THE HOPE OF GETTING. WITH

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:23.769
SOMEONE HOPE OF GETTING THEM

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:25.471
INTO TREATMENT BUT THEY WIND UP

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:27.673
LINGERING IN THE HOSPITAL FOR

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.242
VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND

02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:31.444
THEN DISCHARGED BACK INTO

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:33.179
HOMELESSNESS. IN COMPARISON A

02:02:33.245 --> 02:02:35.314
RECENT UCSF STUDY SHOWS THAT

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.649
LINKING ON HOUSE HIGH UTILIZE

WITH INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:43.255
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:44.523

STUDY SHOWS A VOLUNTARY

02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.532
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:54.934
SUPPORTS CAN KEEP SOME OF OUR

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.035

BOARD YOU WILL SEE FOR EXAMPLE

03:02:19.828 --> 03:02:21.163
TOTAL SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ATHLETES

TWELVE OF TWENTY ONE MILLION

03:02:30.739 --> 03:02:34.009
DOLLARS. OUR PROGRAM WOULD NOT

03:02:34.076 --> 03:02:36.745
TOUCH THAT IT WOULD ONLY ADD TO

03:02:36.812 --> 03:02:38.580
THAT FOR THE ATHLETES BENEFIT

03:02:38.647 --> 03:02:41.317

PROFESSIONAL SPORTS PROGRAMS AND

03:02:47.489 --> 03:02:49.391
THEY WERE SHOWING ME WHY THIS

03:02:49.458 --> 03:02:50.993
BILL WAS UNNECESSARY BUT I

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.128
WALKED AWAY SAYING THIS BILL IS

03:02:53.195 --> 03:02:54.997
EVEN MORE SO I'M EVEN MORE SO

03:02:55.064 --> 03:02:57.199
COMMITTED TO THIS BECAUSE I KNOW

03:02:57.266 --> 03:02:58.133
THE MAJORITY OF COLLEGES DON'T

03:02:58.200 --> 03:03:00.002
HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT THEY

03:03:00.069 --> 03:03:02.104
HAVE AT USC YOU KNOW HOW THOSE

03:03:02.171 --> 03:03:03.605
TYPE OF FACILITIES THEY DON'T

03:03:03.672 --> 03:03:05.374
HAVE THE PSYCHIATRIST AT THE

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:07.676
INTRODUCED ME TO AN ALL BOYS AND

03:03:07.743 --> 03:03:08.444
EVERY COLLEGE IS NOT BENEFITING

03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:10.612
FROM THAT SO WE'RE SEEING. IF

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:11.513
THERE'S ADDITIONAL REVENUE.

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:12.581
THAT'S INCENTIVIZE THOSE

03:03:12.648 --> 03:03:13.916
ATHLETES NOT ONLY TO STAND

03:03:13.982 --> 03:03:15.417
SCHOOL BUT TO GRADUATE AND

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:17.052
THAT'S- WHAT ARE YOU SEE IF IT'S

03:03:17.119 --> 03:03:19.188
NO PROPERTY BE SHARED IT'S NO

03:03:19.254 --> 03:03:20.923
HARM HERE RIGHT I GUESS I'M-

03:03:20.989 --> 03:03:23.492
LOOKING AT AND LOOKING AT. THE

03:03:23.559 --> 03:03:25.027
FUNDS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THE

03:03:25.094 --> 03:03:28.197
STUDENTS THAT SO THEY SUCCEED IN

03:03:28.263 --> 03:03:29.565
COLLEGE AND WE USE THAT EXAMPLE

03:03:29.631 --> 03:03:31.967
HERE IS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:33.102
DOLLARS THAT I WOULD THINK THAT

03:03:33.168 --> 03:03:36.004
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO. GIVE THAT TO

03:03:36.071 --> 03:03:37.306
ALL. STATE WHETHER THEY'RE ON

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:39.041
BADMINTON WRESTLING SO THAT THEY

03:03:39.108 --> 03:03:40.743
SUCCEED ALSO SAID THAT HAVE

03:03:40.809 --> 03:03:42.111
EQUAL TREATMENT THE ACTIVITY IS

03:03:42.177 --> 03:03:44.413
THE SAME. I'M NOT TAKEN OPINION

03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:48.817
NOT AND I GUESS I JUST SPOT THE

03:03:48.884 --> 03:03:51.120
ISSUE GOT. SIR CABALLERO. THANK

03:03:51.186 --> 03:03:52.855
YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR SO

03:03:52.921 --> 03:03:54.923
FOR ME TO START OFF BY SAYING

03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:57.326
THAT- RULES YOUR MIND THAT. THIS

03:03:57.393 --> 03:04:00.763
IS A SCHOOL SET- UTILIZE STUDENT

03:04:00.829 --> 03:04:02.398
ATHLETES AS PART OF THEIR

03:04:02.464 --> 03:04:04.433
PROGRAM. THEY THEN DON'T

03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:06.635
GRADUATE THOSE STUDENT ATHLETES

03:04:06.702 --> 03:04:10.272
. I TO BE. FORECLOSED FROM

03:04:10.339 --> 03:04:12.875
PARTICIPATING BEYOND KIND OF THE

03:04:12.941 --> 03:04:14.376
REGULAR SEASON BECAUSE I FEEL

03:04:14.443 --> 03:04:15.811
REALLY STRONGLY THERE ARE A

03:04:15.878 --> 03:04:18.347
NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES ON NOT

03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:21.617
TOO MANY OF THEM CALIFORNIA BUT

03:04:21.683 --> 03:04:22.684
BUT THERE ARE NUMBERED THEY

03:04:22.751 --> 03:04:25.354
GRADUATE. THEIR ATHLETES RIGHT-

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:27.756
AND- IT'S PARTICULARLY

03:04:27.823 --> 03:04:28.791
PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER

03:04:28.857 --> 03:04:30.926
THAT THEIR ATHLETES OF COLOR ARE

03:04:30.993 --> 03:04:34.496
EVEN WORSE OFF THAN THAT- SO I'M

03:04:34.563 --> 03:04:36.565
SUPPORTING OF YOUR GOAL OF THE

03:04:36.632 --> 03:04:39.168
BILL THE ISSUE I'M TRYING TO

03:04:39.234 --> 03:04:41.503
FIGURE OUT A ALONG WITH- WHAT

03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:43.505
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE SAID IS-

03:04:43.572 --> 03:04:46.275
AS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL. IS

03:04:46.341 --> 03:04:52.414
THAT THE SPORTS. IN THE SPORT

03:04:52.481 --> 03:04:55.083
THAT GENERATES THE REVENUE. GETS

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:57.419
THE REVENUE FOR THEIR ATHLETES.

03:04:57.486 --> 03:04:59.988
AND THAT'S THE SPLIT AND IF

03:05:00.055 --> 03:05:03.058
YOU'RE IN A SPORT THAT IS A NON

03:05:03.125 --> 03:05:06.695
REVENUE GENERATING SPORT- THEN

03:05:06.762 --> 03:05:08.797
YOUR ATHLETES ARE NOT GONNA

03:05:08.864 --> 03:05:10.532
BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:12.000
MONEY THERE WILL BE REVENUE

03:05:12.067 --> 03:05:13.368
THERE WON'T BE EXCESS REVENUES

03:05:13.435 --> 03:05:15.003

SPORTS PROGRAMS ARE FREE

03:06:03.385 --> 03:06:05.387
TICKETS- AND THEY DON'T GENERATE

03:06:05.454 --> 03:06:07.155
REVENUE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET

03:06:07.222 --> 03:06:11.026
INTO THE AN EQUAL YOU KNOW-

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:12.594
ISSUE. IT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE

03:06:12.661 --> 03:06:14.429
RESOLVED AT SOME POINT I JUST

03:06:14.496 --> 03:06:15.063
THINK IT'S GOT TO BE RESOLVED

03:06:15.130 --> 03:06:17.432
AND IT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS.

03:06:17.499 --> 03:06:19.167

03:06:27.009 --> 03:06:29.811
COMMITMENT. TO THE PROGRAM. THAT

03:06:29.878 --> 03:06:32.447
THEY THEY GET THEIR STUDENT

ATHLETES TO GRADUATE I MEAN I

03:06:33.549 --> 03:06:35.617
THAT'S IT JUST IT'S- I THINK

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:37.419
IT'S FUNDAMENTAL WHERE WE WHERE

03:06:37.486 --> 03:06:38.554

THERE'S GOING TO BE- IF. WE

03:06:57.339 --> 03:06:58.173

ARTICULATED IS THAT YOU WANT TO

03:21:45.226 --> 03:21:47.962
AVOID CONSERVATORSHIP WHICH YOU

03:21:48.029 --> 03:21:50.832
BELIEVE IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN

03:21:50.898 --> 03:21:53.468
A SUCCESSFUL. MANAGEMENT

03:21:53.534 --> 03:21:55.236

CORRECT. OKAY WE BELIEVE AN

03:22:01.709 --> 03:22:02.944
ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS IS LESS

03:22:03.010 --> 03:22:04.312

MEDICATION RIGHT I MEAN IS THERE

03:22:12.119 --> 03:22:14.121
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT FORTY

03:22:14.188 --> 03:22:15.923
SEVEN DAYS THAT'S WHAT THE

03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:17.191
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH

03:22:17.258 --> 03:22:19.093

WITH YOUR HAGAR TALKED ABOUT-

03:22:27.201 --> 03:22:31.038
PEOPLE ARE COMING MORE ILL THAN

03:22:31.105 --> 03:22:32.406
THEY USED TO. EXTEND INTO THEIR

03:22:32.473 --> 03:22:34.342
THEIR THEIR THEIR BEHAVE HEALTH

03:22:34.408 --> 03:22:35.276
ISSUES AND ALSO OFTENTIMES WITH

03:22:35.343 --> 03:22:37.745
COMORBIDITY SUBSIDY USE ANOTHER

03:22:37.812 --> 03:22:40.314
KIND OF MEDICAL ISSUES THAT THAT

03:22:40.381 --> 03:22:41.716
NEED. TREATMENT AT THE SAME

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:44.852
TIME- I ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE

03:22:44.919 --> 03:22:46.387
EXAMPLE OF WE ALL HAVE FAMILY

03:22:46.454 --> 03:22:48.055
ISSUES WITH THIS RIGHT I HAD AN

03:22:48.122 --> 03:22:49.490
AUNT WHO HAD SEVERE AND

03:22:49.557 --> 03:22:51.292
PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

03:22:51.359 --> 03:22:53.694
MY COUSIN HAS FOR YEARS UNTIL

03:22:53.761 --> 03:22:54.929
SHE DIED AS LEICESTER GOD REST

03:22:54.996 --> 03:22:58.099
YOUR SOUL- SAID YOU KNOW MY MOM

03:22:58.165 --> 03:22:59.767
WASN'T SICK ENOUGH FOR YOU TO

03:22:59.834 --> 03:23:02.169
KEEP A FOR THIRTY DAYS. BUT SHE

03:23:02.236 --> 03:23:03.504
WAS SICK ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND

03:23:03.571 --> 03:23:05.540
GET RID. THE BE I. B. H. SO TO

03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:07.608
MY IN AND OUT OF THE- MY BECAUSE

03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:09.277
WOULD BAG PLEASE KEEPER OF THAT

03:23:09.343 --> 03:23:10.077
ADDITIONAL TIME BECAUSE THEN SHE

03:23:10.144 --> 03:23:12.013
CAN GET STABILIZED WHEN SHE CAN

03:23:12.079 --> 03:23:13.614
GET STABILIZE ON THE MEDICATION

03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:15.516
SHE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS BUT

03:23:15.583 --> 03:23:17.618
UNTIL THAT TIME. SHE WASN'T ABLE

03:23:17.685 --> 03:23:19.587
TO AND SO THE REVOLVING DOOR OF

03:23:19.654 --> 03:23:22.256
IN AND OUT IN AND OUT AND IN AND

03:23:22.323 --> 03:23:23.257
OUT THIS GIVES A LITTLE BIT

03:23:23.324 --> 03:23:24.025
EXTRA TIME TO GET PEOPLE

03:23:24.091 --> 03:23:25.593
STABILIZE BECAUSE SOMETIMES A

03:23:25.660 --> 03:23:27.328
MEDICATION MIX DOESN'T WORK EVEN

03:23:27.395 --> 03:23:28.095
IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

03:23:28.162 --> 03:23:30.531

QUESTION WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS

04:31:34.177 --> 04:31:36.446

ISSUES FOR THIRTY YEARS- AND THE

04:31:42.819 --> 04:31:45.689
GAP DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER. DOES

04:31:45.756 --> 04:31:47.324
IT YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED ON IT

04:31:47.391 --> 04:31:49.359
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I

04:31:49.426 --> 04:31:50.794
THINK WE'RE WE'RE GETTING THERE

04:31:50.861 --> 04:31:53.530
BUT- BUT IT'S A PROCESS AND PART

04:31:53.597 --> 04:31:55.732

04:31:55.799 --> 04:31:59.636

04:32:10.347 --> 04:32:12.215
BELIEF IN THE COMMUNITY THAT MEN

04:32:12.282 --> 04:32:14.217
NEED TO WORK MORE THAN WOMEN AND

04:32:14.284 --> 04:32:15.218
SO THEY SHOULD GET PAID MORE AND

04:32:15.285 --> 04:32:17.254

04:32:17.320 --> 04:32:19.423

THAT THAT. AT THE- UNDER

05:14:52.173 --> 05:14:54.175
GLORIOUS BILL BUT THEN YOU DON'T

05:14:54.242 --> 05:14:56.510
HAVE THE ABUSER IN THIS ACTION

05:14:56.577 --> 05:14:58.346
AGAINST THE CREDITORS AND IN THE

05:14:58.412 --> 05:15:01.148
DC PARTICIPANTS JOINT LIABILITY

05:15:01.215 --> 05:15:02.483
THEN YES YOU CAN GO AFTER CREDIT

05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:04.118
BUT IF IT'S JUST I THINK WHAT

05:15:04.185 --> 05:15:06.020
YOU'RE GETTING AT IS JUST. IT'S

05:15:06.087 --> 05:15:06.988
JUST IT'S THE WIFE'S WERE THEY

05:15:07.054 --> 05:15:09.991
ABUSED UP CREDIT IT'S NOT THE-

05:15:10.057 --> 05:15:13.361
NOT THE ABUSERS HOW DO YOU JOIN

05:15:13.427 --> 05:15:14.829

LET MY- MY FITNESS SPEAK AS WELL

05:15:30.278 --> 05:15:36.684
BUT- I THINK AS I UNDERSTAND AB. TWO FIVE. THE IT. LEVERAGING

05:15:36.751 --> 05:15:38.519
TO STAY THAT SOMEBODY WAS OR FOR

05:15:38.586 --> 05:15:39.787
CERTAIN DEBTS THESE WERE THE

05:15:39.854 --> 05:15:41.822
RESULT OF ECONOMIC VIEW ABUSE-

05:15:41.889 --> 05:15:44.792
THIS IS A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM-

05:15:44.859 --> 05:15:46.627
CANCELING THAT DEBT OR REMOVING

05:15:46.694 --> 05:15:48.729
ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL LIABILITY-

05:15:48.796 --> 05:15:51.265
AND SO THERE IS NO PROCESS IN

05:15:51.332 --> 05:15:52.500
PLACE FOR DOING THAT THIS GOES A

05:15:52.566 --> 05:15:53.868
STEP BEYOND THAT AND CREATES

05:15:53.934 --> 05:15:56.203
THAT PROCESS SO SURVIVORS

05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:58.205
ACTUALLY CAN ELIMINATE THAT DATA

05:15:58.272 --> 05:15:59.840
AND- THAT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION

05:15:59.907 --> 05:16:04.211

I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD GAS

05:16:12.520 --> 05:16:17.091
AND THAT ONE IS THAT IT IS A

05:16:17.158 --> 05:16:18.192
TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN IT WOULD

05:16:18.259 --> 05:16:19.327
BE- ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION THAT

05:16:19.393 --> 05:16:21.028

AT THE NINE SEVENTY FIVE SO.

05:16:23.164 --> 05:16:25.800
THEY WORK TOGETHER AND IN THAT

05:16:25.866 --> 05:16:27.768
FAMILY COURT COULD IDENTIFY A

05:16:27.835 --> 05:16:29.804
GUY AS BEING THE WORST WHICH

05:16:29.870 --> 05:16:31.939
COULD THEN BE USED AS A PIECE OF

05:16:32.006 --> 05:16:33.708
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A CLAIM

05:16:33.774 --> 05:16:37.878

05:16:41.248 --> 05:16:43.117
CREDITORS PART BUT I THINK WHAT

05:16:43.184 --> 05:16:45.086
THEY WOULD LIKE IT IS YES THE

05:16:45.152 --> 05:16:46.120
SURVIVOR HAS PROVEN TO REST BUT

05:16:46.187 --> 05:16:47.955
WE HAVE NOW HAVE A JUDGMENT

05:16:48.022 --> 05:16:48.989
AGAINST. SOME OTHER PERSON WHO

05:16:49.056 --> 05:16:51.792
IS THE REAL. PARTY IN INTEREST

05:16:51.859 --> 05:16:55.162
I'M ON THE ISSUE OF RESCISSION

05:16:55.229 --> 05:16:56.030
OF THE CONTRACT AND THE

05:16:56.097 --> 05:17:01.535
SECURITY- AUTOMOBILES- THE ONLY

05:17:01.602 --> 05:17:03.304
THING I.KNOW IS THAT THEY

05:17:03.371 --> 05:17:04.538
CAN'T. THEY CAN'T SELL THAT CAR

05:17:04.605 --> 05:17:05.940
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BIG THEY THEY

05:17:06.006 --> 05:17:07.808
GOT THE TIGHTLY GOT A BAD TITLE

05:17:07.875 --> 05:17:09.143
BUT THEY CAN STILL DRIVE IT

05:17:09.210 --> 05:17:10.745
AROUND. AND REGISTER IF THEY

05:17:10.811 --> 05:17:12.413
CAN'T SELL TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT

05:17:12.480 --> 05:17:14.682
THEY JUST HAVE INDEFINITELY-

05:17:14.749 --> 05:17:16.650
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO.

05:17:16.717 --> 05:17:18.018
THAT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE A

05:17:18.085 --> 05:17:19.987
YEAH ADJUSTED. NO I AND I

05:17:20.054 --> 05:17:21.222
ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND SO

05:17:21.288 --> 05:17:22.656
I I'M SYMPATHETIC THE POINTS

05:17:22.723 --> 05:17:23.824
RAISED BY MISTER GOVERNOR. I

05:17:23.891 --> 05:17:25.359
THINK WITH THESE WERE LAID

05:17:25.426 --> 05:17:26.694
AMENDMENTS AND THE GOAL WAS

05:17:26.761 --> 05:17:27.361
ESSENTIALLY TO ADOPT A

05:17:27.428 --> 05:17:29.430
RECESSIONARY APPROACH TO. THE

05:17:29.497 --> 05:17:31.766
CONTRACT FOR THE LOAN OR THE

05:17:31.832 --> 05:17:33.401
CREDIT EXTENDED- AND CERTAINLY

05:17:33.467 --> 05:17:34.902
YOU KNOW IF YOU. YOU YOU KNOW

05:17:34.969 --> 05:17:36.036
YOU HAVE WHETHER IT'S A SECURED

05:17:36.103 --> 05:17:38.205
LOAN OR LOAN USED BY PARTICULAR

05:17:38.272 --> 05:17:39.573
IDENTIFIABLE OBJECT. I DON'T

05:17:39.640 --> 05:17:41.275
JUST GET THE PROPER CREDITS

05:17:41.342 --> 05:17:43.778
BASIC CONTRACTS LAW. AND SO THE

05:17:43.844 --> 05:17:46.447
GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE A DECISION

05:17:46.514 --> 05:17:47.882
B. THE MEASURE AND WE CLEARLY

05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:49.417
CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE

05:17:49.483 --> 05:17:51.385
BANKS THIS IS NOT A PERFECT

05:17:51.452 --> 05:17:53.521
BILL. IT IS GETTING CLOSER TO

05:17:53.587 --> 05:17:55.423
THAT THOUGH AND I CAN APPRECIATE

05:17:55.489 --> 05:17:59.126
ACTUALLY THAT. PERSONALLY WAS.

05:17:59.193 --> 05:18:00.828
IN WRESTLING. ACTIONS TO TRY TO

05:18:00.895 --> 05:18:02.329
THIS BILL ON THE OTHER THE RIGHT

05:18:02.396 --> 05:18:04.165
PLACE. AND WHY DIDN'T THIS

05:18:04.231 --> 05:18:04.999
QUESTION REYES ONE OTHER CONCERN

05:18:05.065 --> 05:18:08.002
BROUGHT UP BY MR WILSON. WHICH

05:18:08.068 --> 05:18:08.602
IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE

05:18:08.669 --> 05:18:09.970
CREDITOR I MEAN IT DID THE OF

05:18:10.037 --> 05:18:11.505
THE USER WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE-

05:18:11.572 --> 05:18:14.575
REQUIREMENT THAT- IT IS CERTAIN-

05:18:14.642 --> 05:18:15.709
CERTAIN FORMS WERE HAPPY

05:18:15.776 --> 05:18:17.978
ATTENDED THE PLEADINGS- BY THE

05:18:18.045 --> 05:18:19.246
PERSON. THAT BE SURVIVORS

05:18:19.313 --> 05:18:21.315
SEEKING TO HAVE THAT. THAT

05:18:21.382 --> 05:18:23.083
CANCELED. ARE THE REASON WE

05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:24.118
DON'T ALLOW HAPPENED

05:18:24.185 --> 05:18:25.319
SPECIFICALLY CALL FOR IDENTITY

05:18:25.386 --> 05:18:27.488
IS BECAUSE THAT. AS DOMESTIC

05:18:27.555 --> 05:18:28.389
VIOLENCE ADVOCATES WILL TELL

05:18:28.456 --> 05:18:30.825
YOU. I HE IS A RECIPE FOR

05:18:30.891 --> 05:18:33.160
DISASTER THAT POTENTIALLY IT CAN

05:18:33.227 --> 05:18:34.728
CAUSE ALL SORTS OF VIOLENT

05:18:34.795 --> 05:18:36.797
SCENARIOS- SO WE'RE BEING

05:18:36.864 --> 05:18:38.933
MINDFUL OF THE BALANCE HERE

05:18:38.999 --> 05:18:40.301
BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF THE

05:18:40.367 --> 05:18:42.269
SURVIVOR. AS WELL AS THAT TEN

05:18:42.336 --> 05:18:44.472
AND WILL BE. AND FIT OF THIS

05:18:44.538 --> 05:18:48.375
PROCESS. ALL RIGHT. COME CERN'S

05:18:48.442 --> 05:18:50.211
OF CIRCLE HERE. THANK YOU VERY

05:18:50.277 --> 05:18:53.514
MUCH MISTER CHAIR RIGHT- CAN YOU

05:18:53.581 --> 05:18:56.617
CAN YOU ARTICULATE A SITUATION

05:18:56.684 --> 05:18:58.219
OTHER THAN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

05:18:58.285 --> 05:19:00.554
SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD YOU

05:19:00.621 --> 05:19:07.161
WOULD- YOU COULD SAY THAT- AND

05:19:07.228 --> 05:19:09.029
I'M I'M LOOKING AT THAT IT WAS A

05:19:09.096 --> 05:19:11.665
COERCED DEBT I. REAL TIME WITH

05:19:11.732 --> 05:19:15.236
WITH THAT THAT THE CONCEPT IN IF%

05:19:15.302 --> 05:19:16.971
IN ANY OTHER SITUATION OTHER

05:19:17.037 --> 05:19:19.640
THAN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- AND

05:19:19.707 --> 05:19:21.408
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT

05:19:21.475 --> 05:19:24.144
THIS IS MORE APPROPRIATELY-

05:19:24.211 --> 05:19:25.613
SHOULD APPROPRIATELY BELOCATED

05:19:25.679 --> 05:19:27.648
IN A IN A FAMILY LARA TO A

05:19:27.715 --> 05:19:30.751
DOMESTIC- IN THE IN THE IN THE

05:19:30.818 --> 05:19:32.353
RULES AROUND RELATIONSHIPS AS

05:19:32.419 --> 05:19:35.723
OPPOSED TO- BEING APPLIED

05:19:35.789 --> 05:19:38.826
BROADLY AND I AM STRUGGLING WITH

05:19:38.893 --> 05:19:40.127
THAT AND I BELIEVE. THE FOR

05:19:40.194 --> 05:19:44.064
FIVE. TWO IS. LIMITED TO- THREE

05:19:44.131 --> 05:19:46.433
SITUATIONS- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

05:19:46.500 --> 05:19:48.469
ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE I

05:19:48.536 --> 05:19:50.237
GUESS FOR FOSTER YOUTH- THOSE

05:19:50.304 --> 05:19:51.839
ARE THE SITUATIONS WE TO SPACE

05:19:51.906 --> 05:19:54.041
SO- IN EACH OF THOSE SINNERS

05:19:54.108 --> 05:19:55.609
OBVIOUSLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS

05:19:55.676 --> 05:19:57.244
THE ONE THAT IS THE PRIMARY

05:19:57.311 --> 05:19:58.879
FOCUS OF THIS BUT A SIMILAR SET

05:19:58.946 --> 05:20:01.815
OF ABUSIVE OR COERCIVE

05:20:01.882 --> 05:20:04.451
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD ARISE IN-

05:20:04.518 --> 05:20:07.588
WHO. WHO IN A SUBJECT TO THE

05:20:07.655 --> 05:20:08.989
CARE OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR FOSTER

05:20:09.056 --> 05:20:12.526
YOUTH- AND JUST AT THAT BAD ON

05:20:12.593 --> 05:20:14.194
THIS IS ROOTED IN A DURESS

05:20:14.261 --> 05:20:17.097
THEORY OF- CONTRACTS LAW THAT

05:20:17.164 --> 05:20:19.199
THAT IS NOT NOVEL. IT'S WELL

05:20:19.266 --> 05:20:20.834
ESTABLISHED IN COMMON LAW GOING

05:20:20.901 --> 05:20:22.970
BACK TO ENGLAND SO- YOU KNOW WE

05:20:23.037 --> 05:20:24.071
THINK THIS IS A NATURAL

05:20:24.138 --> 05:20:25.406
EXTENSION THIS WORK WE'RE JUST

05:20:25.472 --> 05:20:28.409
CLARIFYING THAT ECONOMIC

05:20:28.475 --> 05:20:30.744
COERCION IS A FORM OF DIRECT

05:20:30.811 --> 05:20:33.414
ESSENTIALLY. I AM THE IT IN ARE

05:20:33.480 --> 05:20:35.683
ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL

05:20:35.749 --> 05:20:38.485
RIGHT CENTER BOARD JUST. KIND OF

05:20:38.552 --> 05:20:39.920
IN LINE WITH CENTER COPY COVER

05:20:39.987 --> 05:20:43.223
HEROES QUESTION IS. YOU HAVE

05:20:43.290 --> 05:20:45.693
THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES HERE-

05:20:45.759 --> 05:20:48.128
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS

05:20:48.195 --> 05:20:49.463
THERE. IS THERE AN

05:20:49.530 --> 05:20:50.998
ADMINISTRATIVE OPTIONS THAT IS

05:20:51.065 --> 05:20:53.867
BEING OVERLOOKED IN FAVOR OF THE

05:20:53.934 --> 05:20:57.638
COURT A LEGAL CAUSE OF ACTION.

05:20:57.705 --> 05:21:01.542
WHAT I MEAN. IS THAT. MIGHT

05:21:01.609 --> 05:21:04.111
THERE BE A SITUATION WHERE A CO

05:21:04.178 --> 05:21:09.883
WORST DEPENDENT OR SPOUSE-

05:21:09.950 --> 05:21:11.418
SUBMIT SOMETHING TO LAW

05:21:11.485 --> 05:21:14.054
ENFORCEMENT. AS A AS A

05:21:14.121 --> 05:21:16.323
PRECONDITION FOR SOMETHING LIKE

05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:18.359
THIS THE EVIDENCE IS IN EARLY

05:21:18.425 --> 05:21:21.261
STAGE. THAT THEY ARE ACTING

05:21:21.328 --> 05:21:24.431
UNDER DURESS WITHOUT DISCLOSING

05:21:24.498 --> 05:21:26.300
NECESSARILY IN ANOTHER

05:21:26.367 --> 05:21:29.036
INFORMATION- THAT COULD PUT THEM

05:21:29.103 --> 05:21:31.772
IN HARM'S WAY BECAUSE WHAT WE

05:21:31.839 --> 05:21:33.674
HAVE HERE IS WE HAVE LENDERS

05:21:33.741 --> 05:21:34.842
THAT THROUGH NO FAULT ON

05:21:34.908 --> 05:21:36.844
MODERATOR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

05:21:36.910 --> 05:21:40.147
WANT TO. CLOSE OUT THE QUEUE-

05:21:40.214 --> 05:21:42.149
LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND LINE

05:21:42.216 --> 05:21:51.892
THAT IS YOUR APOLOGIES FOR THAT. IF YOUR LINES ARE OPEN PREVIEW. I THINK WE'RE AND WHERE I'M

05:21:51.959 --> 05:21:53.460
GOING IS THAT HAVE WE'VE

05:21:53.527 --> 05:21:56.964
EXHAUSTED THE IDEA THAT THERE BE

05:21:57.031 --> 05:21:59.366
OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE BECAUSE

05:21:59.433 --> 05:22:00.734
WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

05:22:00.801 --> 05:22:03.504
LENDERS IN GOOD FAITH LAND TO A

05:22:03.570 --> 05:22:05.806
PARTY THEY HAVE NO REASON TO

05:22:05.873 --> 05:22:08.342
OBTAIN INSIGHT INTO THE DOMESTIC

05:22:08.409 --> 05:22:10.244
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT HOUSEHOLD

05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:12.680
OR WHETHER A HUSBAND OR A WIFE

05:22:12.746 --> 05:22:14.915
OR SOME OTHER PARTNERSHIP. IS

05:22:14.982 --> 05:22:16.817
TROUBLED THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD

05:22:16.884 --> 05:22:18.619
PROHIBIT- THE CONTRACT FROM

05:22:18.686 --> 05:22:20.888
BEING FILLED SO HOW DO YOU

05:22:20.954 --> 05:22:24.858
BALANCE OUT THE INTERESTS OF THE

05:22:24.925 --> 05:22:29.630
INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT HARMING THE-

05:22:29.697 --> 05:22:31.899
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. PLACE

05:22:31.965 --> 05:22:33.333
BECAUSE OUR BANKING AND LENDING

05:22:33.400 --> 05:22:38.672
SYSTEM. IS ONE OF THE BEDROCK OF

05:22:38.739 --> 05:22:40.874
HOW WE FUNCTION IF YOU TAKE IF

05:22:40.941 --> 05:22:43.744
YOU INJECT A HIGH DEGREE OF

05:22:43.811 --> 05:22:44.845
UNCERTAINTY WHICH A BILL LIKE

05:22:44.912 --> 05:22:46.547
THIS COULD DO. AS A MEANS OF

05:22:46.613 --> 05:22:48.015
FOLKS BEING ABLE TO GET OUT

05:22:48.082 --> 05:22:49.550
SHOULD THEY REPRESENT THAT THEY

05:22:49.616 --> 05:22:51.218
WERE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE

05:22:51.285 --> 05:22:53.287
OR WERE UNDER YOU KNOW OR OR

05:22:53.353 --> 05:22:55.823
WERE UNDER- SOME FORM OF

05:22:55.889 --> 05:22:59.393
INTIMIDATION- I'M JUST. MORE OF

05:22:59.460 --> 05:23:01.228
A DISCUSSION POINT LIKE HAVE WE

05:23:01.295 --> 05:23:03.831
EXHAUSTED ALL IDEAS BEFORE

05:23:03.897 --> 05:23:05.899
MOVING IN THIS COURSE OF ACTION-

05:23:05.966 --> 05:23:07.601
WE'VE NOT EXHAUSTED ALL IDEAS OR

05:23:07.668 --> 05:23:10.237
INPUT I WOULD SAY THAT. THE TO.

05:23:10.304 --> 05:23:12.272
CHARACTERIZE THE PROCESS OF THIS

05:23:12.339 --> 05:23:14.074
BILL IS MERELY SAYING I'M

05:23:14.141 --> 05:23:16.043
UNHAPPY IN MY MARRIAGE OR I WAS

05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:17.144
THREATENED IS NOT ACTUALLY AT

05:23:17.211 --> 05:23:18.812
THIS BILL DOES YOU NEED SOME

05:23:18.879 --> 05:23:19.813
KIND OF DOCUMENTATION WHETHER

05:23:19.880 --> 05:23:21.782
POLICE REPORT. REPORT FROM A

05:23:21.849 --> 05:23:22.716
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE

05:23:22.783 --> 05:23:24.985
COUNSELOR- OR A JUDGE OR

05:23:25.052 --> 05:23:26.887
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO

05:23:26.954 --> 05:23:28.388
ESTABLISH THAT YOU'RE IN AN

05:23:28.455 --> 05:23:29.590
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP OR SOME

05:23:29.656 --> 05:23:31.959
MEASURE APPROVED. AND THAT DEBT

05:23:32.025 --> 05:23:33.560
INCURRED WAS INCURRED DURING THE

05:23:33.627 --> 05:23:35.095
PERIOD THAT ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

05:23:35.162 --> 05:23:36.697
AS A RESULT OF THE ABUSE. SO

05:23:36.764 --> 05:23:38.866
THAT IS WHAT CREATES IN ORDER

05:23:38.932 --> 05:23:41.168
MEANS THE IN BUT A MEANS- AND

05:23:41.235 --> 05:23:45.239
APPROPRIATE TIME. BECAUSE IF MY

05:23:45.305 --> 05:23:48.475
WIFE AND I- PURCHASED A CAR IN

05:23:48.542 --> 05:23:50.677
WE WERE IN THIS. PARTICULAR CALL

05:23:50.744 --> 05:23:53.413
STE. ALL BUT TEN YEARS OR YOU

05:23:53.480 --> 05:23:54.848
KNOW FIVE YEARS INTO INTO THE

05:23:54.915 --> 05:23:57.885
REPAYMENT. YOU KNOW- IT'S

05:23:57.951 --> 05:24:00.387
DISCLOSED THE HARM COULD BE

05:24:00.454 --> 05:24:01.688
BORNE BY THE LENDER THROUGH THIS

05:24:01.755 --> 05:24:04.291
BILL SO THE IDEA IS AT IN

05:24:04.358 --> 05:24:06.660
APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF TIME. IS

05:24:06.727 --> 05:24:08.829
THERE IN ADMINISTRATIVE. ACTION

05:24:08.896 --> 05:24:11.031
THAT COULD BE TAKEN THAT WOULD

05:24:11.098 --> 05:24:15.569
OTHERWISE- I ALSO NOT UNCLEAR

05:24:15.636 --> 05:24:17.204
INTERRUPT- CENTER- WHAT DO YOU

05:24:17.271 --> 05:24:19.139
MEAN BY THE MINISTRY OF ACTION

05:24:19.206 --> 05:24:21.341
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SENSE

05:24:21.408 --> 05:24:22.676
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OR- SOME OF

05:24:22.743 --> 05:24:23.777
SOME OF MORE REALIZATION WHETHER

05:24:23.844 --> 05:24:25.179
IT BE. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- OR

05:25:45.192 --> 05:25:46.827
REASONS THAT I DECIDED TO TAKE

05:25:46.894 --> 05:25:49.463

06:19:45.696 --> 06:19:51.568
IDENTIFIABLE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO

06:19:51.635 --> 06:19:52.836
PROTECT THAT FAMILY AND THOSE

06:19:52.903 --> 06:19:54.938
CHILDREN UNTIL THE COURT CAN

06:19:55.005 --> 06:19:56.106
ACTUALLY HAVE A HEARING ON IT

06:19:56.173 --> 06:19:59.309
SO- I THINK THAT- I THINK

06:19:59.376 --> 06:20:01.111
FIFTEEN DAYS IS REASONABLE AND

06:20:01.178 --> 06:20:02.980
IF IT CAN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE OF

06:20:03.046 --> 06:20:03.847
THE COURT SCHEDULE THEN I THINK

06:20:03.914 --> 06:20:06.383
THEY A TEMPORARY ORDER SHOULD BE

06:20:06.450 --> 06:20:08.318
APPROPRIATE AND YOU MIGHT THINK

06:20:08.385 --> 06:20:10.387
OF ADDING AT THAT KIND OF A BUT

06:20:10.454 --> 06:20:11.889
I'VE EVER RELEASED IT PROVIDES

06:20:11.955 --> 06:20:14.825
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURT TO

06:20:14.892 --> 06:20:16.994
MAKE A FINDING THAT THEY JUST

06:20:17.060 --> 06:20:19.463

06:20:19.530 --> 06:20:20.731

ARGUED LAST YEAR WITHIN THE

06:51:39.908 --> 06:51:42.044
CONTEXT OF SENATOR WIENER'S SB

06:51:42.110 --> 06:51:43.245
TWO TWENTY ONE THAT IT IS A

06:51:43.311 --> 06:51:44.846
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ISSUE- AND

06:51:44.913 --> 06:51:45.981
THERE ARE LACK OF PROVIDERS IN

06:51:46.048 --> 06:51:47.516
THIS AREA PARTICULARLY ONES.

06:51:47.582 --> 06:51:48.750
THAT ARE WILLING TO CONTRACT

06:51:48.817 --> 06:51:50.585
WITH PLANS SO THAT IS SOMETHING

06:51:50.652 --> 06:51:51.953
THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND I

06:51:52.020 --> 06:51:54.389
THINK SENATOR WIENER HAS ONE

06:51:54.456 --> 06:51:56.258
THAT- THIS YEAR BUT- YOU KNOW I

06:51:56.324 --> 06:51:57.759
WILL SAY CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH

06:51:57.826 --> 06:51:58.693
PLANS ARE HEAVILY REGULATED

06:51:58.760 --> 06:52:00.062
CURRENTLY UNDER THE KNOX KEEN

06:52:00.128 --> 06:52:02.297
ACT- THERE ARE THERE IS A

06:52:02.364 --> 06:52:03.165
PENALTY STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

06:52:03.231 --> 06:52:04.132
BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES

06:52:04.199 --> 06:52:05.934
AND CIVIL PENALTIES. ON THE

06:52:06.001 --> 06:52:07.669
GRANTS THE DIRECTOR OF GMAC THE

06:52:07.736 --> 06:52:09.471
DEPARTMENT MATTERS HEALTH CARE

06:52:09.538 --> 06:52:11.239
WHY TO FORTY TO LEVY PENALTIES

06:52:11.306 --> 06:52:12.874
ON HEALTH PLANS- AND EVEN REVOKE

06:52:12.941 --> 06:52:15.110
LICENSES OF PLANS- THAT ARE IN

06:52:15.177 --> 06:52:18.046
VIOLATION OF THE ACT. WE BELIEVE

06:52:18.113 --> 06:52:19.381
THAT THE CURRENT LAW ALREADY

06:52:19.448 --> 06:52:20.315
GRANTS SUFFICIENT FORSMAN

06:52:20.382 --> 06:52:20.949
AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

06:52:21.016 --> 06:52:22.417
MANAGED HEALTH CARE WHICH HAS

06:52:22.484 --> 06:52:23.118
ALLOWED ITSELF PRETTY

06:52:23.185 --> 06:52:25.520
CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE I'M IN

06:52:25.587 --> 06:52:27.022
ASSESSING PENALTIES AND AS

06:52:27.089 --> 06:52:30.258
RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED ITS

06:52:30.325 --> 06:52:32.994
SIGNIFICANT BIRDS- IN

06:52:33.061 --> 06:52:34.429
ADDITION TO PENALTIES THE TEAM

06:52:34.496 --> 06:52:36.031
YOU SEE ALSO ISSUES CORRECTIVE

06:52:36.098 --> 06:52:37.899
ACTION PLANS WHICH REQUIRE

06:52:37.966 --> 06:52:39.134
HEALTH PLANS TO REMEDY PROBLEMS

06:52:39.201 --> 06:52:41.837
ARE FACE EVEN FURTHER SANCTIONS

06:52:41.903 --> 06:52:43.705
. WHAT IS SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT

06:52:43.772 --> 06:52:45.307
DO. SO I THINK SOMETIMES BILLS

06:52:45.373 --> 06:52:47.375
CHARACTERIZE MERELY UPDATING ON

06:52:47.442 --> 06:52:48.310
THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE

06:52:48.376 --> 06:52:49.978
ESTABLISHED IN THE NINETEEN

06:52:50.045 --> 06:52:52.080
SEVENTIES. AND YOU KNOW IF THAT

06:52:52.147 --> 06:52:53.014
WAS THE CONVERSATION I THINK

06:52:53.081 --> 06:52:54.883
THAT WOULD BE ONE THING WHAT

06:52:54.950 --> 06:52:56.351
THIS BILL DOES THOUGH. IT

06:52:56.418 --> 06:52:57.419
DELETES THE LIMITATIONS SO

06:52:57.486 --> 06:52:58.653
THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON CIVIL

06:52:58.720 --> 06:53:00.822
PENALTIES- IT IN THE LAW IT

06:53:00.889 --> 06:53:02.224
ANYMORE IF THIS BILL WOULD SPEAK

06:53:02.290 --> 06:53:03.892
WERE TO BE ENACTED. SO IT

06:53:03.959 --> 06:53:05.193
DELETES THE CEILING. AND

06:53:05.260 --> 06:53:07.028
REPLACES IT WITH A FLOOR THAT IS

06:53:07.095 --> 06:53:09.030
TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE

06:53:09.097 --> 06:53:10.265
CEILING- AND YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE

06:53:10.332 --> 06:53:12.534
THAT. IT IS PRETTY EXCESSIVE-

06:53:12.601 --> 06:53:14.402
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- SO IF YOU

06:53:14.469 --> 06:53:15.403
KNOW REPRESENTS A WHOPPING

06:53:15.470 --> 06:53:16.771
INCREASE IN SINGLE CIVIL

06:53:16.838 --> 06:53:18.340
PENALTIES BY A FACTOR OF TEN

06:53:18.406 --> 06:53:19.541

06:53:21.877 --> 06:53:22.444

ENFORCEMENT IS TO- YOU MAKE

06:53:24.045 --> 06:53:25.847
