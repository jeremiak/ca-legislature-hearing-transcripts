00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.405
DIFFERENT IMPACT. ON OUR

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.641
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. ALTHOUGH WE

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:25.942
HAVE INVESTED MORE RESPONSES

THAN EVER BEFORE AND HOUSING

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:29.546
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WE

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:31.080
HAVE A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER UP

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.416
TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECADES AND

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:36.619

HOMEOWNERS. FOR PERSPECTIVE THIS

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.470
YEAR'S REVENUE WAS TWO HUNDRED

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.906
BILLION. WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:59.175
TEN MILLION FOR THE HOPE ACT.

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.176
THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:01.811
REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A TEN YEAR

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.313
INVESTMENT STRATEGY WITH

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:05.381
SPECIFIC METRICS AND MEASURABLE

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:06.282
OUTCOMES AND I WANT TO

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:07.350
UNDERSCORE THAT THE

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:08.785
ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENTS OF

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:09.419
THIS ARE VERY CRITICAL SO WE

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:11.387
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- ARE

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:13.323
VOTERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.024
A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT IN

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:17.193
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY FIXING THIS

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:17.994
PROBLEM. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.662
APPROVE EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.464
AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS.

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:23.032
EVERY OCTOBER THE ADMINISTRATION

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.235
WERE WOULD REPORT THE OUTCOMES

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:26.069
OF THE HOPE BACK TO SHOW HOW

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:28.271
MANY UNITS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.339
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING HOUSE

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.541
ETCETERA. IN OTHER WORDS THE

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.343
DIRECT IMPACTS OF THESE DOLLARS.

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.345
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.080
IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:38.114
PROPOSITION FOR US HERE IN THE

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.949
STATE AS WELL AS THE RAINY DAY

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.651
FUND WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:44.554
FUNDING DIRECTED TO THE HOPE ACT

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:45.922
. THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL CAME

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.190
OUT OF A HOUSING WORKING GROUP

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:48.258
MANY OF YOU PARTICIPATED IN

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:51.194
AROUND THIS PAST FALL. AND TOOK.

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.996
MANY HOSTED EVENTS AND WENT TO

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:54.797
DIFFERENT EVENTS AND WHERE WE

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:55.431
DISCUSS THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:57.467
HOUSING CRISIS. REPEATEDLY AT

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.202
EACH STOP. AT ALMOST EVERY

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.537
SINGLE STOP. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.739
CONSTITUENTS HOMELESSNESS

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:03.973
SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AFFORDABLE

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.375
HOUSING DEVELOPERS LAMENTED THE

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.976
LACK OF FUNDING TO BUILD

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:08.578
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TO

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.713
PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.682
THIS MEASURE IS BOLD. AND SOME

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.017
MAY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:16.085
EFFECT OF LOCKING IN FUNDING ON

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:18.054
FUTURE BUDGET YEARS. BUT WE DO

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.989
NOT HAVE A CHOICE AT THIS POINT

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.858
TO TRULY ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:23.459
OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:24.227
CRISIS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:25.662
SPEND THESE DOLLARS. FOR

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.397
MULTIPLE YEARS. THE HOPE ACT

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:29.332
REFLECTS WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS A

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.000
MORAL IMPERATIVE TO END

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.336
HOMELESSNESS AND TO GIVE

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:35.138
FAMILIES AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.372
LIVE. IN ADDITION I ACCEPT THE

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:37.373
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.175
CLEAR THAT THE 5% SET ASIDE IS A

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.411
FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING. AND

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:43.112
CREATE A TRIGGER TO TURN OFF THE

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.981
ALLOCATION TO THE HOPE FUND IF

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:47.650
THE STATE IS IN A DEEP RECESSION

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:48.584

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.323
ACTING OF PRECAUTION WHERE THEY

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.325
INTERPRET IT AS A HOUSING IS NOT

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.361
PART OF THIS I KNOW OBVIOUSLY BY

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.261
THE MISSION OF WHAT'S ARE YOU

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.896

BE INCLUDED IN IT BUT I JUST

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.834
WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN INCLUDE.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:12.968
THE MENTION OF IT JUST SO THAT

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:15.371
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE FUTURE

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:15.904
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:16.705
POSSIBLE TO DETERMINANTS SO-

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.240
WHEN I APPRECIATE THE ADVOCACY

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.142
ON SOCIAL HOUSING IN THE SOMEONE

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.777
WHO'S I CHAIR THE SELECT

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:22.411
COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL HOUSING AND

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.912
HAVE COST THEIR PREVIOUS BILLS

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:26.148
WITH YOU AND- SUPPORTED- YOUR

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.249
SOCIAL THE BILL GETTING OUT OF

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:29.084
COMMITTEES. THIS YEAR I'M VERY

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:31.420
SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT- AND

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.455
THE CREATIVITY AROUND NEW IDEAS

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.290
TO TACKLE THE- HOUSING CRISIS

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.926
THAT WE ALL LIVE IN YOU KNOW

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:39.261
THIS BILL- DOESN'T PRESCRIBE

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.030
SPECIFICALLY HOW THE FUNDS WILL

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.364
BE STATE WILL BE SPENT. I MEAN

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.400
WE DID THAT WITH A LOT OF

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:45.367
INTENTIONALITY AROUND CREATING

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.403
FOR ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY- YOU

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.104
KNOW WITH A BILL WE AND YOU KNOW

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:52.708
I'M POWER AND REQUIRE A BCS AGE

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.343
TO DEVELOP A TEN YEAR. FUNDING

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.412
STRATEGY AS WE INCH MARKS AND I

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.047
THINK THAT IS THE PLACE FOR

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.314
THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN IN

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:00.482
TERMS OF WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.418
AND HOW CAN THESE. FUNDS TO BE

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.452
ALLOCATED AWAY THAT'S MOST

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:10.292
EFFECTIVE THAT THAT GETS SORT OF. R. O. Y. ON THE INVESTMENT-

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.127
AND SO- THOSE MATCH. I THINK OF

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.063
TO BE COULD. AND I AS WE YOU

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.165
KNOW IF YOUR BILLS TO MOVE FOR.

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:18.701
AND YOU KNOW- BE SIGNED INTO LAW

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.802
BY THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW IF

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:20.369
THAT BECOMES A MECHANISM BY

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.004
WHICH THERE IS- SORT OF MONEY

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:23.839
WELL SPENT ON THE ISSUE. I THINK

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.674
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN PLAY

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.409
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STRATEGY-

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:28.077
THAT IS DEVELOPED BY THE AGENCY.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.545
AND THEN REFLECTED IN THE

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.346
METRICS AND SO I WANT TO

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:31.980
PRESERVE FLEXIBILITY. FOR THAT

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:35.951
TOO- FOR B. S. B. C. S. H. TO.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.753
BOTH CREATE THAT PLAN AS WELL AS

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.988
PROVIDE THE- ACCOUNTABILITY

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.423
REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.624
SO THAT SHOULD YOUR BILL COME

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:43.959
INTO PLAY AND GET SIGNED INTO

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.961
LAW. THERE'S A PLACE FOR THOSE

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.563
DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE CONTEXT

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.330
OF THAT. YEAH AND CERTAINLY I'M

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:49.698
NOT ASKING FOR ANY CERTAIN

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.934

PRESCRIBED AS OF HOUSING OR ANY

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.903
OTHER MECHANISM IN THAT SENSE
