TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN I HAD HOPED. SO WE'RE GONNA ROLL RIGHT IN AS A SUB COMMITTEE LOOKS LIKE WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. AND WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TWO TWENTY NINE SENATOR HERTZBERG. I'LL MAKE IT. EVEN THOUGH I GOT A LONG STORY ITSELF. WAY. STUFF AGAIN. CONTEXT CONTEXT WERE LAWMAKERS. THANK YOU MEMBERS IN THE GEMSTONE -- WE WENT ALONG LAWS. THIS YEAR IS A THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE BILLS IN THE SENATE TO BE CONSIDERED. OF ASSEMBLY BILLS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SENATE BILLS TO BE CONSIDERED. AND STE HOWEVER MANY COME OUT AND GO TO THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR SIGNS IN THE FILLER TWENTY NINE CODE BOOKS FULL OF LOS. LOTS OF TIMES TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIG THROUGH AND FIND THOSE LAWS AND THAT'S WHY PELLA HIGH PRICE LAWYERS TO FIGURE THAT STUFF OUT MOST OF THE TIME. IN THE AREA OF EMPLOYMENT LAW THERE'S CERTAIN AREAS OF PUBLIC POLICY THERE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN EVERYBODY'S OFFICE AS IS REQUIRED. THIS POSTER. MAY BE PREPARED BY THE CHAMBER I DON'T KNOW WHO ACTUALLY JUDGES BUT THIS IS WHAT'S IN EVERYBODY'S OFFICE. OF EVERY BUSINESS THAT IS A BUSINESS LICENSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PART OF THAT WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT IS WHISTLEBLOWERS. THE RIGHTS OF WHISTLE BLOWERS THE OPENING SENTENCE I'M ONLY GOING TO READ THAT SAYS. TO PUT MY GLASSES ON IT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHEN THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEIR EMPLOYER IS IN VIOLATION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL STATURE OR VIOLENT OR NOT COMPLYING WITH STATE OR FEDERAL LAWS OR RULES. AND FURTHER EXPLAINS WHAT IS IT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT AREA PUBLIC POLICY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TWO YEARS AGO. I INTRODUCED IN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE LAST GOVERNOR SIGNED A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAW. THIS IS A FOLLOW ON TO THAT LAW. AND PROVIDES A EXPEDITING BASIS WHERE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER CAN ON THE DEFAULT BASIS IS SIMPLY FILE THE THE CITATION AND MOVE FORWARD IT'S A SMALL CHANGE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE IN THE SENSE OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED NOW AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE THAT WE MADE. IN THE PROCESS OF FIXING THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAW IN CALIFORNIA WITH THAT. GOT MY STAR WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER TO REMEMBER SUICIDE OR WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- WE'RE ALSO PROUD TO WORK WITH HER HERTZBERG ON SB THREE OH SIX AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO BETTER PROTECT WORKERS FROM ILLEGAL EMPLOYER RETALIATION -- THE BILL WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT IN THE TIME SINCE WE'VE LEARNED OF SOME AREAS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER CLARIFICATION. AS MENTIONED BY THE SENATOR VERY IMPORTANT ONE IS MAKING SURE THAT FINAL ORDERS OR CITATIONS CAN BE. JUST IMPLEMENTED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER LAWSUIT THE BILL IS SILENT ON SB THREE OF SIX WAS SILENT ON THAT POINT OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FINAL ORDER AND SO. THE CONSENSUS IS THAT ANOTHER LAWSUIT WOULD BE NECESSARY WHICH IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH SB THREE OF SIX AND SO. THIS BILL HELPS MAKE THAT PART OF THE PROCESS WORK BETTER IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR INFORMAL HEARINGS TO BE CONDUCTED BY DEPUTY LABOR COMMISSIONER'S RATHER THAN. FORMAL ONES CONDUCTED BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES SO THAT THIS PROCESS LOOKS MORE LIKE OTHER ONES CONDUCTED BY DEAL I SEE AND SO IT'S ONE THAT. EVERYONE INVOLVED FROM THE EMPLOYERS TO THE AGENCY ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH AND WE THINK THAT THOSE TWO IN ADDITION A FEW OTHER TWEAKS WILL HELP MAKE SB THREE OF SIX WORK MUCH BETTER AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- BEFORE WE GO FURTHER LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAU CHIU.

WELCOME WELL THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND AND COLLEAGUES SB TWO TWENTY THREE IS A REPEAT OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST SESSION. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH REINFORCED THE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE RIGHTS OF THE SCHOOL BOARD AS SPECIFIED IN THE BROWN IT. SB TWO TWENTY THREE JUDGES ACT WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS IS MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM. IN NON SMOKING AND NON VAPING FORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDE DURING SCHOOL HOURS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS BY LAW IT'S ONE THOUSAND FEET OFF CAMPUS. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEIR MEDICINE WHICH IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING. SB TWO TWENTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR A CHARTER SCHOOL TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY. IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THAT OPT IN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING. IF FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY SB TWO TWENTY THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE QUALIFIED. TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES DENTURES LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST. GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR TRIALS MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP ON FILE SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND THE I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTER THERE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY ANY THANK YOU AND THERE ARE ELSE. OTHER AMENDMENTS BESIDES WAS WE TALKED ABOUT IN CONVERSATION WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- WE LIKE TO ADD THAT -- A PARENT OR GUARDIAN WHEN THEY GIVE THE SCHOOL THAT THEY WOULD GIVE THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME. THAT THEY NOTIFY THE SCHOOL OF THE NEED FOR THE MEDICAL CANNABIS. THAT THE THE GIVE THE SCHOOL AN AFFIDAVIT THAT'S CONFIRMING THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH A PEDIATRICIAN OR A SPECIALIST OF OF OF SOME KIND THAT IS -- WORKING WITH THEM IN DETERMINING THE OF THE MEDICAL USE OF THE CANNABIS SO THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE THE BILL WE WILL ADD THAT TO THE BILL OKAY AND THEN THERE ARE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANNOUNCES THAT YES. THERE'S A MEMBERS THANK YOU PERFECT ACTION THANK YOU FOR THIS PLACE. THE MORNING SENATORS MY NAME IS KARENA MCCAIN I'M HERE TO SUPPORT JOBS ARE WHICH IS THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY USER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS [inaudible] SO JUST. FOR THE BILL MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER. EXCUSE ME BY ANY THAT DAY. MY NAME IS KARENA MCCAIN I'M HERE TO SUPPORT JUDGES ACT SB. TWO TO THREE MY SON GIOVANNI JUDGE -- HE MENACE HAS USE CANNABIS IN TINCTURES CBT AND TEACH THE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LENNIX GUSTO SYNDROME. THIS KIND OF EPILEPSY IS VERY RARE. AND VERY HARD TO CONTROL. JUDGE JOE WITH MEDICAID AT THE VERY HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO FITTED WITH A DEVICE CALLED THE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR. ALL WITH NO SUCCESS I WAS WATCHING MY SON DIE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND THE EFFECTS OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY. AND CHOSE TO TRY IT AS OUR LAST RESORT. WE HAD TO GET A WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM OUR NEUROLOGISTS PRIOR TO SPEAKING AT IS SEEKING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR THAT TREATED MINERS NOT ALL DO. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED CANNABIS AND IT SEEM VERY HOPEFUL. DAY BY DAY I SEE THEM EMERGE FROM IS MEDICATED STATE AND STARTING GAUGING AGAIN. CAESAR'S WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL DUE TO JO JO NEEDING A DOES THAT SCHOOL TWELVE PM DAILY. I ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY AND BE THE VOICE MY SON AND SO MANY OTHERS WE NEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMPASSION. THANK YOU LISTEN THIS PLEASE GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY NAME IS JENNIFER COMMISSION I'M A WIFE A MOM TO A BEAUTIFUL SIX YEAR OLD BOY NAMED ZACHARY. AND I'M ALSO AND I SEE INTEREST AT A LEVEL TWO TRAUMA CENTER IN SAN JOSE. I SPOKE BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR ABOUT MY SON ZACHARY. AT FIVE MONTHS HE BEGAN HAVING SEIZURES THAT COULD NOT BE CONTROLLED WE WERE TOLD HE WOULD NEVER WALK TALK AND WERE SENT AWAY WITH HOSPICE PAPERWORK. TO BE HONEST I NEVER EVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CANNABIS BILL. BEFORE WITNESSING THE CHANGES TO ZACHARY SEIZURES I WAS VERY PREJUDICED AGAINST CANNABIS AND I WAS COMPLETELY AN EDUCATED ABOUT ITS MEDICAL FACTS. I UNDERSTAND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE CONCERNS. I TRULY WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY I WISH THE MEDICATIONS THE DIETS THE TREATMENTS AND ALL THE SPECIALIST HAD WORKED FOR ZACHARY. AND THAT IS THE USERS HAVE RESOLVED WITHOUT THE USE OF CANNABIS OR PHARMACEUTICALS BUT THAT IS NOT MY REALITY. MY REALITY IS THAT WE EXHAUSTED EVERY TREATMENT AND MEDICATIONS WITH NO SUCCESS. MY REALITY IS OUT OF DESPERATION BEFORE TRYING CANNABIS I CHOSE A DRUG THAT COULD CAUSE PARTIAL OR TOTAL BLINDNESS AND 70% OF PATIENTS. AND IT ACTUALLY MADE THESE SEIZURES WORST. I REALITY IS THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CANNABIS WE WENT FROM BEING ON SEVEN MEDICATIONS AND HAVING ABOUT SIXTY SEIZURES A DAY. TO CURRENTLY ONLY BEING ON ONE MEDICATION. AND CANNABIS AND ITS LAST GRANDMA SEIZURE WAS ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. MY REALITY IS THAT MY SON THIS YEAR LOSS NINETY HOURS OF LEARNING IN HIS KINDERGARTEN YEAR SO WE COULD PULL HIM OFF CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICATIONS TO KEEP A SEIZURES AT BAY. MY REALITY IS IT IS TEACHERS MAY RETURN DESPITE THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. BUT ALL THIS NOISE SHOULD NOT BE ZACHARY'S REALITY. SACRAMENTO RIGHT TO FATE FREE FROM DESTRUCTION -- DISRUPTIONS DESPITE HIS MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND REQUIRE TREATMENT. HE HAS A RIGHT TO RECEIVE HIS MEDICATIONS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PEOPLE IN SCHOOL NOT DOWN THE STREET FROM THE SCHOOL. DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES IS ACREE IS FACED IN HIS SHORT LIFE MY REALITY IS THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT ANY BATTLE. TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY A LITTLE EASIER. THE PRIVILEGE OF GAINING BACK THOSE NINETY HOURS OF LOS LEARNING IS WHY I AM HERE TO SEE YOU TODAY. TO SHARE MY REALITY IN HOPES THAT YOU WILL CHANGE DOCKERY'S REALITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I STRONGLY URGE A YES VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS ADDRESS. FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS REGARDING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE PEDIATRICIAN. I DO THINK THAT -- THAT IS IMPORTANT. AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH. HOW MANY CHILDREN? ARE IMPACTED BY THIS DO WE KNOW. I DON'T KNOW BUT WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE IT I DON'T THINK THAT MANY BUT THOSE THAT DO. DEFINITELY DO NEED THEM. I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT CHILDREN HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT TO RECEIVE MEDICATION THAT'S NEEDED FOR THEM THAT IS PRESCRIBED. PROPERLY PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PEDIATRICIAN I THINK IS. IS IS IS WRONG -- AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD MOVE TO SPEND. SEC. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WAS GONZALEZ. I WANT -- TO THANK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENT IT I I AM TO BE VERY HONEST IT DOESN'T SATISFY I THINK MISS AS THEY DID MISS RATES IT DOESN'T SATISFY MY CONCERNS -- WE HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR I THINK I SAID I WOULD VOTE FOR AND I DID -- REALLY GOOD AT COUNTING VOTES I DON'T WANT THIS BILL TO FAIL IN THIS COMMITTEE. I JUST WANT TO SO I I WILL BE VOTING FOR TODAY -- I THINK THAT. YOUR STORIES ARE SO COMPELLING IN ANYTHING ABOUT TO SAY IS IN NO WAY A REFLECTION ON ON THE TWO OF YOU AS MOTHERS AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND AND THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN. I STILL AM VERY CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE TRUE PROTOCOLS. ON HOW. PARENTS SHOULD BE WORKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS -- DIRECTLY. WHEN THEIR -- THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOME SORT OF TREATMENT FOR THEIR CHILD -- OF MEDICINAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR WHO OFFERS A PRESCRIPTION ONCE A YEAR. AS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW IS NOW. DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL LIKE ESPECIALLY WITH. EXTREME HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT ALSO WHAT COULD BE MINOR HEALTH CONDITIONS RIGHT IT DOESN'T KEEP A PARENT FROM SAME MIGHT MY CHILD HAS. A MIGRAINES AND I'M PLAYING WITH THE DOSAGES AND SO YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT I'VE DECIDED FOR MY CHILD IF IF I OFTEN ON THE MARIJUANA DEBATE IT'S NOT THE SAME WITH MEDICINAL BUT LIKE YOU I I I'M NOT ANTI CANNABIS BUT I OFTEN. JUST TAKE THE WORD CANNABIS REPLACE IT WITH LIKE WHISKEY. RIGHT AND YOU'RE LIKE ARE WE DOING THINGS THAT MAKES SENSE -- MEDICINALS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PARENTS THOUGHT A LITTLE WHISKEY IN A BOTTLE WOULD HELP A CHILD SLEEP OR WOULD HELP WITH TV RIGHT. WE WILL NOW TAKE YOUR CHILD IF YOU DID THAT -- SO. I I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU AND IN THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE LAW IN THE STATE OF THE LAW THAT ALLOWS -- SUCH FLEXIBILITY -- WITH LITTLE HUMAN BEINGS -- AND SO I'M I'M GONNA GO ON THE VOTE FOR IT TODAY -- I WON'T LET IT FAIL ON THE FLOOR I WOULD VOTE FOR IF NECESSARY BUT IF I DON'T VOTE FOR ON FLOOR THAT'S WHY IT'S JUST A STATEMENT THAT I REALLY THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET TO A POINT. WHERE -- PEDIATRICIANS CAN WRITE AN ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION YOU KNOW -- FOR THE THE PROTOCOL THAT IF WE HAD A PEDIATRICIAN NOT JUST AN AFFIDAVIT FROM THE PARENT BUT A PIC PEDIATRICIAN PRESCRIPTION. I'D BE FINE WITH THIS A SPECIALIST PRESCRIPTION I'D BE FINE I JUST WANT. MORE STEPS THAN THE MEDICINAL MARIJUANA CARD. FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE PROTECTING ALL CHILDREN SO I'M I'M A VOTE FOR TODAY BUT THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK THANK YOU DEAR THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU FOR THE WILLINGNESS TO KEEP THIS MOVING AND THE CONVERSATION THAT I THINK.

WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO LIVING. ON THE EDGE BARELY COVERING THEIR BASIC NEEDS STEP FOUR POINTS OUT THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A SUDDEN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR CHARGE A SUDDEN WIPING OUT OF A CHECKING ACCOUNT. PUSHES PEOPLE OVER THAT EDGE. NOTHING IN SENATE BILL. SIX ONE SIX A RACE IS THE DEBT OR STOPS THE DEBT COLLECTOR FROM SEEKING REPAYMENT THIS BILL WILL KEEP A ROOF OVER THE HEADS. OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE THROWN OUT INTO THE STREET. BECAUSE THE RENT. PAYMENT HAS BEEN LEVY. WITH ME I HAVE THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BILL WITH ALLEGE. IN SUPPORT AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. FIRST WITH US PLEASE THANK YOU HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE -- THANK YOU I CHAIRPERSON MARK STONE AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- MY NAME IS TO BRING A HAM AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING COALITION C. A. B. C. SUPPORT OVER AT SPURS ARE EXCUSE ME REPRESENTS OVER TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND WE WORK TO SUPPORT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO HELP LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES BECOME MORE FINANCIALLY SECURE AND ACHIEVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY. WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SIX ONE SIX AS IT WOULD PROTECT BANK ACCOUNTS FROM BEING LEVY DOWN. TO ZERO WE UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE MUST MANAGE TO PAY DOWN THEIR DEBTS BUT HARSH DOUBLE DECK COLLECTION. PRACTICES PURCHASE PURCHASE FAMILIES. INTO GREATER FINANCIAL INSTABILITY. FAMILIES MUST BE ALLOWED A MINIMUM LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO PAY THEIR BILLS MAKE GRANT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SB. SIX ONE SIX WILL ALLOW FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WHILE THEY MANAGE PAIN DOWN THERE DEBTS WE UNDERSTAND THAT CURRENT REGULATIONS. HAVE CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS BUT EVEN IF NOT CHALLENGED BY THE DEBT COLLECTOR. ARE AND ARE AWARDED THEY ARE NOT. ONLY WITH THE ONLY AWARDED AFTER THE FACT MEANWHILE THAT THE MONEY IS TAKEN FROM THE ACCOUNT. AND THEN THE PERSON. HAS TO WIN THE CLAIM IN ORDER TO GET THE MONEY BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ONE STORY IT RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM THE BAY AREA. I CLIENTS RECEIVING SSI AND WAS THE SST I PAY FOR HER DAUGHTER NIECE AND NEPHEW ALL OF WHOM ARE DEPENDENT ON HER. A LADY WAS PLACE IN HER ACCOUNT FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUDGMENT FROM TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO SO THAT WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. AN ELDERLY WOMAN SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SET UP. SET UP. A DIRECT DEPOSIT INTO OUR COUNSELORS SO SHE RECEIVED SSI. BENEFITS IT ONTO A DIRECT. DEPOSIT EXPRESSCARD. AND THEN DEPOSIT THE MONEY INTO YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT BECAUSE THERE WERE NO DIRECT DEPOSIT INTO OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT BOTH THE BANK AND THE COLLECTION. LAW FIRM REFUSED TO STOP OR DELAY LEVY ON YOUR ACCOUNT DESPITE THE FACT THAT ESTA SIDE. TI ARE LEGALLY PROTECTED FROM COLLECTIONS ACTIVITY. EVEN AFTER STANDING AND PROOF OF THE FUNDS CAME FROM A SOCIAL SECURITY THE BANK WOULD NOT COMMIT TO HALTING THE LEVEES. WELL WE BELIEVE HE SHE WILL EVENTUALLY WON HER CASE IT WON'T BE UNTIL AFTER THE FAMILY. FACES -- BANK FEES LATE FEES ON RENTON OTHER BILLS AND OTHER ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS WHILE WAITING FOR THIS. WE NEED DEBT COLLECTOR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES THAT PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM UNEXPECTED SHOCKS THAT CAN LEAVE CAN LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS DEPRIVATIONS AND ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN STABLE WHILE PAYING THEIR BILLS. SB SIX WEEKS. SIX AND DOES SYSTEM PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM REMAINING ARE BECOMING UNBANKED AS RESULT OF DEBT -- SOMETHING THAT IS EXPECTING PART TO CBC. AND SO MUCH OF OUR AT THE BUILDING WORK. HOW MANY THINK THE SENATOR KOWSKI FOR HIS CONTINUED COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB SIX ONE SIX THANK YOU? THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTLETT WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- WE ARE SPONSORED SUPPORTED THIS BILL -- WE WANT TO THANK THE BANKING ASSOCIATION WHO WORKED WITH US IN THE AUTHOR TO TAKE AMENDMENTS WHICH HELPTHEM AND ALL OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COME OFF OF THE BILL AND THEY ARE OF NO NEUTRAL. THE ONLY -- AND THE OPPOSITION AS OPPOSED TO HEAR FROM LATER ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE MONEY FROM DOING LEVEES -- WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE CURRENT LAW -- LEAVES OUT PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY -- WHO ARE FARM LABORS PEOPLE HAVE SEASONAL WORK? SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS PEOPLE WHO ARE TREATED AS CONTRACTORS EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT ANYBODY WHO GETS MONEY. OTHER THAN A WAGE. AT THEIR MONEY GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE ACCOUNT OR IF THERE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THIS CLIENT -- SHE HAD A EXEMPTS PAYMENT BUT IT GOT I WENT INTO HER CHECKING ACCOUNT IN A WAY THAT WAS -- NOT A DIRECT DEPOSIT. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE TO HAVE A LEVY THAT GOES NOT JUST DOWN. TO ZERO BUT BEYOND ZERO BECAUSE IT IT THE BANK THEN CHARGES A FEE. AND THEN THEY GET BOUNCED CHECKS ARE BOUNCE PAYMENTS -- AND THESE CLIENTS COME INTO OUR EVICTION CLINICS THEY COME INTO OUR CONSUMER CLINICS ACROSS THE STATE AND LEGAL SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND IF THEY GET HELP. AND THEY WHEN THEY'RE KIND OF EXEMPTIONS THE GET THE MONEY BACK BUT ONLY AFTER THE THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING AND MANY TIMES THEY WALK AWAY FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT. I'M ONE THING WE DO KNOW IT WESTERN CENTER IS THAT PEOPLE ARE RARELY LEAVE POVERTY WITHOUT DEBT -- AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE A HARD TIME DOING SO IF THEY DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. THIS BILL HELPS PREVENT -- PEOPLE FROM HAVING THEIR PATH OUT OF POVERTY FOR EVER TRUNCATED -- AND FOR THAT WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT AND SPONSOR AND THANK YOU -- FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS WITH. GOOD MORNING DANIEL KENDO BECAUSE OUR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION WE ALSO ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. WE THINK SENATOR WITH HOUSE KEY FOR THIS BILL WHICH CLARIFIES THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION PROCESS IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS DEBTORS TO MORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND BOWL FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND FURTHERMORE WE POINT OUT THAT THE BILL FOLLOWS POLICY. WHICH IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN SIXTEEN OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT -- IN THIS IS POLICY THAT IS EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AROUND THE COUNTRY -- WE THINK THE SENATOR FOR HIS AUTHORSHIP AND WE URGE YOUR AYE THE THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. HI SEVEN MIN TEN WITH VOICES FOR PROGRESS WHERE THE ONE PERCENTERS WHO WILL AFFECT FOR THE 99% WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JOE RIGHT OUT ON BEHALF CONSUMER ACTION IN SUPPORT. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. GIVE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SAY NOT AS THEIR OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- CLIFF BURKE HERE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS -- WANT TO MAKE A FEW POINTS REGARDING THIS BILL -- WE ARE OPPOSE WE BELIEVE IN IT IT EFFECTIVELY BANS BANK LEVEES AND ELIMINATES BANK LEVEES AS A TOOL FOR COLLECTION OF LEGITIMATELY -- DEBT IN CALIFORNIA. BOB I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT A BANK LEVY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A HOST JUDGMENT TOOL. USED TO COLLECT UNDISPUTED DEBT OWED BY THE DEBTOR TO A CREDITOR. AS A POST JUDGMENT TOOL THE SCENARIO THAT. KEEPS BEING. EXPLAIN BY THE PROPONENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WAKING UP AND FINDING THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS EMPTIED JUST MAKES NO SENSE IN EFFECT THE POST JUDGMENT TOOL MEANS THAT THE DEBT HAS BEEN IN COLLECTION FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. THE CREDITOR THEN MADE THE DECISION TO GO TO COURT. THEY MADE A DECISION TO GO TO COURT TO GET A JUDGMENT AND SUE THE DEBTOR BEGINS THE DAY IT WAS NOT IN DISPUTE. AND BECAUSE THAT WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN ABILITY TO PAY. OR ELSE WHY WOULD THEY INCUR THE COST OF AN ATTORNEY GOING TO COURT AND COURT FEES. TO SUE THE DEBTOR SO THEY WENT TO COURT THE DEBTOR GOT NOTICE THAT THE ITEM WAS IN COURT. A JUDGMENT WAS ISSUED IT WENT BACK TO COLLECTION IT'S IN COLLECTION AGAIN FOR ANOTHER YEAR AT THAT POINT THE CREDITOR GOES BACK TO COURT A SECOND TIME TO GET A RICH. TO EXECUTE. ALL ON THE BANK ACCOUNT. THE PROBLEM WITH ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH HIS BILL IS THAT WELL YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT LOW INCOME DEBTORS WAKING UP WITH NO MONEY IN THEIR ACCOUNT. IN PRACTICALITY THIS BILL HAS NO CONNECTION TO LOW INCOME. OUT ALL IT APPLIES ALL DEBTORS WITH THEIR HIGH INCOME MIDDLE INCOME. ARM OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WORKED ON IN THIS AREA WE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO LIMIT. COLLECTION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS LOW ACTUAL LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN WE CAN GIVE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF EXAMPLES OF HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THIS BILL. ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS IS BILL IS THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTING PROCESS IN LAW. SO THE EXISTING PROCESS IS CALLED THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION PROCESS WHICH WAS SET UP TO PROTECT LOW INCOME PEOPLE TRULY LOW INCOME PEOPLE. THE BENEFIT OF THAT PROCESS IS THAT HAS JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ENSURE THATYOU'RE ACTUALLY PROTECTING LOW INCOME PEOPLE UNDER THAT PROCESS SOCIAL SECURITY SS I SS BE UNEMPLOYMENT WELFARE ALL. AUTOMATICALLY EXEMPTED THIS IS THE NEW AUTOMATIC TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR EXEMPTION ON TOP OF ALL THOSE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS. WILL TRULY LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE A CLAIM. OF EXEMPTION FOR NECESSARIES OF LIFE WHICH COVER RENT UTILITIES FOOD. ALL OF THE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DEFINED IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS EXPANDED IN TERMS OF THE EXEMPTION. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THE AUTOMATIC NATURE THE FACT THAT IT PROTECTS ALL DEBTORS NO MATTER THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS IT'S OVER BALK BROAD AND IT'S UNCLEAR WE TALK ABOUT. IT APPLIES TO A DAD OR NOT TWO ACCOUNTS THERE'S NO WAY THE CREDITOR KNOWS WHAT ACCOUNTS THE DEBTOR HAS THE BANKS GOT OFF THE BILL BECAUSE THEY GOT OFF THE HOOK OF HAVING TO MAKE THAT DECISION BY THE AMENDMENTS. BUT IN ESSENCE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WAS MADE WORSE BY ADDING ANOTHER WHO PREFER IN ESSENCE THE CREDITOR TO JUMP THROUGH. SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANKS WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SONYA GIPSON HERE ON BEHALF OF ON COURT CAPITAL GROUP IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE STORIES DESCRIBED IN TESTIMONY AS WELL AS TO LOW INCOME DEBTORS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL CAST A WIDER NET THAN JUST LOW INCOME DEBTORS IT IS AN AUTOMATIC TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR EXEMPTION. FROM A LAST RESORT COLLECTIONS PROCESS FOR ALL DEBTORS AND THE AUTOMATIC NATURE IS THE EXACT REASON WE ARE CONCERNED -- DEBT BANK LEVEES ARE A LAST RESORT IN IN OUR ONE IN FIVE CONSUMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH US AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT BANK LEVEES. ARE THE LAST RESORT AFTER SEVENTEEN NOTICES SEVENTEEN ATTEMPTS TO WORK WITH THE CONSUMER IT HAPPENS TO A TWO THREE YEAR CYCLE AND OF TWO TO THREE YEAR PROCESS. THE OTHER MISSTATEMENT AYE I BELIEVE IS THAT -- THE BANK ACCOUNT IS ENTIRELY EMPTIED THIS IS JUST NOT TRUE IT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH FEDERAL AS WELL STATE LAWS THAT PREVENT THE BANK ACCOUNT FROM BEING LET EMPTIED ENTIRELY. LET'S START WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU GO TO ISSUE A BANK LEVY ICE I SUBMITTED TO THE BANK. THE BANK THAT'S OR THE CREDIT UNION FOR THE CONSUMER IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL TREASURY LAWS TO LOOK BACK TO TWO MONTHS OF ACTIVITY IN THE CONSUMERS BANK ACCOUNT. AND AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCT THE EXEMPTIONS THAT INCLUDE 75% OF WAGES THAT I'VE MET THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT. THINGS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FEDERAL EMPLOYEE AND CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS AS WELL AS VETERANS BENEFITS SO THAT'S STEP ONE THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS DONE BY THE BANK ACCOUNT. THEN FROM THERE ON THEY RESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF THE BANK LEVY AND IF THE CONSUMER AT THAT POINT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED OR THAT THEY DO NEED ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR FOOD RENT. CAR PAYMENTS AT CETERA THAT IS WHERE THEY CAN FILE THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION FORM. AS A CREDITOR WE HAVE TEN DAYS TO RESPOND TO THAT FORM. IF THERE'S SOMETHING UNUSUAL ON THE FORM THAT IS WHEN WE WOULD OBJECT OTHERWISE THERE'S NO REASON TO PROLONG THE PROCESS WITH A LOW INCOME DEBTOR AND OBJECT. TO A CLAIM OF EXEMPTION PROCESS SO THAT THE CLAIM IS PROCESSED WITHIN TEN DAYS IT IS ONLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE A BMW AND MERCEDES BENZ IS BEING CLAIMED AS AN EXEMPTION. THAT WE WOULD THEN OBJECT AND IT GOES FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE IN THIRTY DAYS. SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WHAT THIS IS DOING IS TAKING AWAY THIS PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A REVIEW DONE TO SAY DOES SOMEONE NEED THE HELP OR ARE THEY GOING TO JUST BE. GIVEN A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR OUT FROM DEBT -- FINALLY I I I THINK THAT DOES IMPLY THAT SIXTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE THIS EXACT THING UNDER CURRENT LAW IS JUST NOT TRUE. THE VAST MAJORITY THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE THAT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC NATURE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATES HAVE A PROCESS WHAT CONSUMER MUST APPLY FOR THE CLAIM. JUST AS IT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA UNDER CURRENT LAW. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL AS A PICTURE. IS GOING TO CAUSE LESS ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR CONSUMERS HIGHER INTEREST RATES I DON'T THINK THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BANKS WILL TRULY BUFFER THEIR LOSSES ON A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT FOR OTHER CONSUMERS BY INCREASING INTEREST RATES. AND AND GRANTING LESS CREDIT TO LOW INCOME BORROWERS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LONG TERM. ALBUMS THAT WILL. ACTUALLY GO TO THE LOW INCOME CONSUMERS FROM THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I UP PLEASE I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE WE'RE ALSO. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. CENTER PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS THERE WERE. A COUPLE OF YEAH I MEAN I THINK ISSUES WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION YEAH I THINK PAGE NINE TALKS AND ISSUE NUMBER TWO IDENTIFIED IN THE ALSO TALKS ABOUT THIS THIS MEANT THAT IT'S GOING TO TRY A CREDIT. THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO FOLKS SAY -- PROFESSOR KRISHNAMOORTHY FROM UC BERKELEY HAS. HAS WRITTEN EXACTLY ON POINT THAT THIS IS A FALLACY THAT IT'S NOT POINTED THAT THE CREDITS NOT TO BE AVAILABLE HASN'T HAPPENED IN YOUR CAPS AT HAVE HASN'T HAPPENED IN DELAWARE. I GUESS WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IS THAT THIS IS THE LAW I DON'T EXPECT THE DEATH CULT. THAT COLLECTORS NOT TO ENFORCE THE LAW TO THE FULLEST EXTENT AN EMPTY ALL PEOPLES BANK ACCOUNTS I MEAN THIS SORT OF IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE. LIGHT FOOTED AND AND WE'RE NOT AND AND BE FAIR. TO LOW INCOME -- DEBTORS IS JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN I PRACTICE BANKRUPTCY LAW FOR THIRTY YEARS THEY WILL EMPTY OUT THAT ACCOUNT THE THE BANKS EITHER ARE DOING A POOR JOB. OF PROTECTING PEOPLE SO SECURITY CHECKS OR THERE ARE 75% THEIR INCOME EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THAT'S THE LAW. THE IN FACT THEY'RE SEIZING ALL THE MONEY THAT'S IN THE BANK AND AS THE STAFF IS A STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT. TALKS OUT OR EXPLAINS THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION IS UNWORKABLE UNWORKABLE ON ON PAPER SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING WITH AN AUTOMATIC -- EXEMPTION WE'RE SAYING YOU GET TO PROTECT THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH I MEAN IT WILL APPLY TO ALL THAT IS NOT JUST LOW INCOME DEBTORS. TO PROVIDE THEM IF OF EIGHT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY I'M IN THAT'S THE CHANGE A LAW THAT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED WE HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. OF LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS SINCE WE CREATE A BANK LEVEES SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN SAID WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON ON HUMAN LIVES AND I'VE. AND I'VE SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN THIS AREA AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY INTO. EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS NOT THAT -- BIG OF AFFECT ON THE INDUSTRY AS IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE INDIVIDUAL -- CONSUMERS WHO WHO ARE DEVASTATED BY HAVING NO MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. YEAH BUT I DON'T I MEAN WHAT THEY SAID THAT THAT THE PRICE ALL BETTER SISTER YOU KNOW AND CIARA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR -- YOU KNOW THAT I THINK THAT. WE WE KNOW THE NUMBERS SHOW -- EARLY STUDIES SHOW THAT ABOUT. A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR EMERGENCY AND I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA -- GIVEN THE COST LIVING THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ISN'T A WHOLE LOT IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE -- IT'S NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OF THE DEBT COLLECTOR -- TO ENSURE THAT OUR OF OUR LOW INCOME AND AND DOES IT ARE STRUGGLING TO GET BY. CAN CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO GET BY WITH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S JUST. A BASE AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN LIVE ON AND YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS MIDDLE INCOME MORE HIGHER INCOME. AND HAS MORE ON THEIR ACCOUNT MORE THAN THEY CAN. TAKE IT ALL EXCEPT THE FOUNTAIN OF THE LAST TWO THOUSAND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY MUCH SIMPLER WAY OF DOING IT. THEN ALL DID THIS OTHER PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHAT MEANS THEY HAVE BEEN -- AND I THINK THAT I THINK THE TWO THOUSAND IS THE IT IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE REALLY AT THE AT THE CUSP OF ON THE EDGE I DON'T. WE DON'T FALL OVER THAT CLIFF AND SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE MOVE THIS. THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. I WILL SECOND THAT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WITH US I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY -- I THINK I FEEL LIKE WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION LIKE YOU'RE IN. AN AND YOU'RE OUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I I ALSO FEEL LIKE I'M NOT SURE -- I'VE EVER GOTTEN TO THE CORE OF OF THE DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT PEOPLE SAY THIS BILL DOES -- IT'S NOT LIKE SOME OF OUR OTHER PREDATORY LENDING BILLS THAT I REALLY UNDERSTAND. NUMBER ONE I THINK TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY LIKE MY CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK ACCOUNT SO WHEN IT'S PRESENTED AS SOME SORT OF WORKING FAMILIES ISSUE -- THAT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S PERHAPS WRONG I I REPRESENT OF MAY BE. SUBSTANTIALLY POOR COMMUNITY BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. AND SO WHEN I HEAR THEN IT'S NOT MEANS TESTED. I DO WORRY HOW THIS CAN BE A BUTTE. I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS BILL IS LIKE. TWO THOUSAND FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH -- WHEN PEOPLE HAVE REAL REAL OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO PAY NOW I DO UNDERSTAND LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE IT FOR A MINUTE? AND AND THAT'S COME THROUGH AND MAYBE IT'S FOR OVER THREE MONTHS AND YOU KNOW IT IT AT THAT. THAT MOMENT BUT THEN I'M HEARING THERE'S A LOOK BACK -- TIME PERIOD SO I WOULD LIKE BOTH OF THE AYE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY. I WOULD AGAIN LIKE YOU TO COME IN AND LIKE LITERALLY. I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO KEEP COMING UP OFF MISTER ACCOUNTS YOU JUST NEVER STOP WHICH IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU YOU KNOW. I'M SO I WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE SAYING THAT DON'T MATCH UP DOES THAT MAKE SENSE -- SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S GOING% TO BE RESOLVED FOR ME HERE TODAY AND I I HAVE COMMITTED TO VOTING FOR IT. BUT I I REALLY DO FEEL LIKE -- SOME OF THE RHETORIC DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE THE KIND OF EXPERIENCES THAT MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE SO I'M I'M UNCOMFORTABLE. IF THAT MAKES SENSE MISTER CHAIR YOU'VE YOU'VE TOUCHED ON YOU KNOW I MEAN BRIEFLY PLEASE THANK LEVEES ARE A MOMENT IN TIME IT'S AT THIS MOMENT SO SO WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF LEVY SICKER ON APRIL SIXTEENTH. WHEN PEOPLE GET THEIR INCOME TAX RETURN BECAUSE THAT'S AT THAT MOMENT IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S THE TOP THE MOMENT THAT THE THE BANKS GET IT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU JUST DEPOSIT YOUR PAYCHECK AND YOU ONLY GET? FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS THAT WHOLE THING IS GONE IT'S NOT A PER PERCENTAGE YOU DON'T GET YOU DON'T IT'S IT'S HELD SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM THE OTHER AS FAR AS THE NUMBERS AGO YOU CAN GET THIS A STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT. YOU CAN GET FOOD STAMPS AND HAVE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT THAT'S THE POVERTY LEVEL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES SO WE'RE BELOW THAT NUMBER AS FAR AS WHAT PEOPLE WOULD. RETAIN IN THEIR CHECKING ACCOUNTS SO THAT'S IT OF THE NUMBERED I MEAN I START OFF WITH FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS IN THIS COMMITTEE SO I'VE I'VE. I'VE. TRIED THE COMPROMISED THE THIS IS THE THIS IS A COLLECTION TOOL THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE UNTIL WE MODIFY IT. THANK THANK YOU NO THERE WAS NOT REALLY A QUESTION A QUESTION THERE I THINK THE ASK OF MS GONZALEZ. WE HAVE THE VOTES. HOPEFULLY TO MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE BUT SOME MEMBERS HAVE SOME INITIAL QUESTION AND I THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE GO WORK ON THOSE THIS FEATURE NORRIS. SEC I TO WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY BUT AND I THINK. YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE HERE EVEN IN THE SERVICE OF COLLECTING A LEGITIMATE THAT WE DON'T WANT. SOMEONE'S LAST DOLLAR TO BE TAKEN AND AND PEOPLE BE LEFT DESTITUTE. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT KIND OF BLANKET NO QUESTIONS ASKED NATURE. OF THE EXEMPTION BASE I THINK WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WELL STE WE MOVE LEGISLATION THAT'S PROTECTING THOSE FOLKS THAT THE RIGHT ON THE EDGE. THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT DO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PAY A DEBT. THAT IS LEGITIMATE. THAT WE'RE NOT USING THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT BEING PROTECTED BY THIS. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT AS WELL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS HOUSE WAS OVERLOOKED. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT. THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS. COULD END THE PRACTICE OF LIVING BANK ACCOUNTS ESSENTIALLY FOR THEM BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT A DEBTOR NEVER HAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT. THE LEVY WILL NEVER BE EFFECTIVE. IT IS THAT IS THAT UNDERSTANDING CORRECT. WELL THAT THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW LEVY SIR. ONE MOMENT IN TIME. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY LEVY TODAY AND SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT THE LEVY DOESN'T RECEIVE ANY MONEY SO. I WOULD SAY. TRUE I MEAN IT'S JUST MEMBER BANK LEVEES ARE ONE TOOL TO DEBT COLLECTORS HAVE TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ONE TOOL THEY CAN GARNISH PEOPLE PEOPLE'S WAGES THAT SEE. A POPULAR IN -- WILL USE WAY TO COLLECT THAT WE PASS LEGISLATION HERE TO CURB THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS BECAUSE IT REFLECTS TODAY'S VALUE. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE -- NOT EXISTENT JUST AS I DON'T BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INCOME WHO ARE REALLY YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT THE PEOPLE ARE HI INCOME LEARN WAGER WAGER INNER CENTER. NOT GOING -- TO BE AFFECT IF YOU HAVE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN YOUR BANK UNDER THIS BILL. TWO THOUSAND REMAINS THERE BEFORE THOUSAND GETS PAID TO THE CREDITOR I MEAN IF YOU IF. YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW TOTALLY DESTROYED OKAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS UNDERSTANDING RIGHT SO IF YOU IF THE CONSUMER. NEVER HAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT THEIR BAG OUT COULD NEVER BE LEVIED CORRECT. DO YOU KNOW HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF DEBTORS THAT HAVE THESE ARE THESE JUDGMENTS. HAVE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THEIR BANK ACCOUNT BECAUSE I MEAN I WOULD GUESS JUST NAIVELY THAT THAT THAT IS NOT VERY MANY WELL AGAIN IT'S IT'S A MOMENT IN TIME SO YOU CAN YOU CAN SAY AFTER YOU PAID ALL YOUR BILLS. THAT'S TRUE BUT THIS IS YOUR YOUR YOUR CHECKS DON'T GET TO BE PROCESS WITH THE PAYMENT OF BILLS. THE LA COUNTY SHARE OF INDICATED THAT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD JUST IN LA COUNTY THEY HAD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND LEVEES WHICH IS LIKE A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PER. PER YEAR IN LA THAT'S WHAT 25% POPULATION. A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO IT SAY IT AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE CENTER. TO BRIEFLY CLOSE I'M I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED -- FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IT AND IT. MODIFIES EXISTING TOOL THAT THE DEBT COLLECTORS HAVE IN ORDER TO COLLECTED THAT AND ONCE AGAIN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DEBT GOAL WEIGHT A DEBTOR STILL.

THESE ANIMALS DON'T PERFORM TRICKS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO THEY ARE THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DO NOT. AS PETER HAS REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED ANIMALS IN THE CIRCUS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH VICIOUS BEATINGS BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING ON THE STAGE.

AND WE SEEM TO BE OUT OF SENATORS FOR THE MOMENT WE COULD. SEE IF THEY'RE MORE AUTHORS ON THEIR WAY THAT WOULD BE SENATOR MITCHELL. WILL TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER SIX SB. THREE TWENTY NINE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY WE'RE GOOD? OUR COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE TWO NINE THE BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT LANDLORDS COULD NOT REJECT A TENET SOLELY BASED ON THEIR SOURCE OF INCOME. THIS FUNDAMENTALLY IS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE. IT IS NOT A MANDATE AS REFLECTED IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE. SIX OUR STATE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVING HOUSING ASSISTANCE ARE STRUGGLING TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY DO THE BLANCA POLICIES BY LANDLORDS WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT. AT THE SAME TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO HOUSING ASSISTANCE AS A WAY OF SHIELDING TENANTS FROM HIGH HOUSING COSTS. AND PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS. CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES ALL OVER THE NATION HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTION FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WITH GREAT SUCCESS. BERKELEY SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO IN SANTA MONICA ALL HAVE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS DRAFTED AN ORDINANCE TO DO THE SAME. UNDER THIS BILL LANDLORDS WOULD STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCREEN VOUCHER HOLDING APPLICANTS USING THE SAME CRITERIA THEY USE FOR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY BAR THEM FROM REFUSING SOMEONE'S APPLICATION JUST BECAUSE THEY GET HELP PAYING THEIR RENT. YOU ALL HAVE SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENTS TWO BEDROOM ONE APARTMENT NELL SECTION. EIGHT TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH NO SECTION EIGHT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PUBLISHED REPORTS THAT LOOK AT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WITH SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. THAT STUDY FOUND THAT FOR EVERY THIRTY NINE RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR APARTMENTS THAT A FAMILY WITH THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE ABOUT YOUR COULD AFFORD. THERE WAS ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT WE'RE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS WERE NOT IN PLACE DENIAL RATES FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WERE AS HIGH AS 75% OR MORE. IN JURISDICTIONS WITH SERVICE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS THIS DID NOT ALL RIGHT WAS ALMOST CUT IN HALF. THIS SITUATION IS THAT ACCEPTABLE. IF WE FOUND OURSELVES FACING DATA THAT 75% OF GROCERY STORES REFUSE FOOD STAMPS AND PEOPLE CAN USE IT TO BUY FOOD WE WOULD CRY FILE. IN THIS INSTANCE WITH REGARD TO SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS -- CRY CRYING FOUL. WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE SITUATION FOR THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE GIVE STRUGGLING RESIDENTS. EITHER ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A PROVEN POLICY AVAILABLE TO CORRECT IT. THE HOUSING CRISIS AS HIT HARDEST LOW INCOME RENTERS RISING RENTS LACK OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STAGNANT INCOMES MAKE THIS POPULATION THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. MEMBERS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN AREAS THAT HAD BEEN DEVASTATED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. SUCH AS THE RECENT WILDFIRES WHICH PUT US A FURTHER IN A HOUSING DEFICIT. WE'VE HEARD NUMEROUS CONCERNS THE BILL'S BEEN DOUBLE REFERRED IN BOTH HOUSES AND SO WE'VE ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ANY NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AND I JUST LIKE. TO ON THE FRONT AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD. WE'VE HEARD EVERYTHING FROM OF THE BURDEN SOME PROCESS TO INSPECTION TIMES ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WHETHER IT RESTRICTS THE LANDLORDS ABILITY TO RAISE THE RENT AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THOSE. WITH REGARD TO BEING A BURDEN SOME PROCESS THE INSPECTION SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A BURDEN SINCE THEY ARE PERFORMED TO ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER MONEY IS USED APPROPRIATELY. BY ENSURING THAT THE UNIT MEETS EXISTING SAFETY AND BUILDING STANDARDS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT STANDARDS ARE MET BUT THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBLIGATIONS OF A VOUCHER EXCEPT LANDLORD AND A NON VOUCHER ACCEPTING LANDLORDS. WITH REGARD TO INSPECTION TIME. FLIGHT DELAYS EXISTS WITH THE LANDLORD BEGIN TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME DUE TO THE NEED TO COMPLETE ROUTINE PAPERWORK AND HAVE A BASE EXPECTS AND PERFORM. AND THESE DELAYS VERY COUNTY BY COUNTY CITY BY CITY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE PRE INSPECTION AW -- THEY HAVE A PRE INSPECTION POLICY THAT'S ONE BUSINESS DAY AFTER RECEIVING THE REQUEST. ORANGE COUNTY THE TURN AROUND TIME AN ORANGE COUNTY IS QUICKEN OFTEN DOES NOT EXTEND MORE THAN TEN DAYS IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE COMMON FOR NEW CONTRACT INSPECTED TO HAPPEN WITHIN ONE BUSINESS WEEK. AS THEY PRIORITIZE NEW CONTRACTS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE A TRUCK THERE TURN AROUND IS VERY QUICK THEY INSPECT UNITS WITHIN THE SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY. DEPEND UPON THE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE LANDLORD. LA COUNTY MOUNT HOME COUNTY -- TENDS TO HAVE. WE HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGES AS WE LEARNED IN DOING THIS WORK -- BUT EVEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE MAJORITY OF INSPECTIONS ARE FINALIZED WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. WITH REGARD TO ADDITIONAL COST YOU TO REPAIRS TO ENSURE THAT IT'S UP TO HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS ARE BASICALLY THE COSTS THE LANDLORD HAVE -- TO EXPERIENCE. WITH REGARD TO THE CONCERN THAT IT RESTRICTS THE LANDLORDS ABILITY TO RAISE RENTS I WANT TO CLARIFY VAL JEWS DO NOT LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT LANDLORDS CHOOSE TO CHARGE FOR RENT. THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE AN INCREASE ONCE SAID ABOUT YOUR EIGHTEEN IT IS IS IS A TENANT -- IF IT'S NOT APPROVED IN THE TEN IT WOULD HAVE TO MOVE. THE LANDLORD WOULDN'T BE PROHIBITED FROM INCREASING THE RANT THEY JUST MIGHT LOSE THAT SECTION EIGHT TENANT IF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. BOB DOES NOT APPROVE THE INCREASE. THERE BEEN EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASED -- LAWSUITS. AND THE REALITY IS FEE HOP PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VARIOUS CLASSES OF PEOPLE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A LANDLORD WHO RECEIVED AN APPLICATION FROM A QUALIFIED TENANT WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS MUST ACCEPT THAT PERSON. IT JUST MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM. THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THIS BILL AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE IT REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO TREAT FAMILIES WITH ASSISTANCE FAIRLY AGAIN IT DOES NOT REQUIRE. THAT LANDLORDS EXCEPT THE SECTION EIGHT TENANT. AGAIN BOTH THE SENATE JUDICIARY IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY -- ANALYSES ARE QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BILL IS NOT A MANDATE. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE AND INTRODUCE YOU TO LATOYA MCNEIL WHO IS AFFECTED RESIDENT. AND BILL SPONSORED SASHA HARMED IN REPRESENTING THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS. HI MY NAME IS LATOYA MAKE MALE AND I REPRESENT FAITH IN THE VALLEY. OF SAN JOAQUIN AND PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. THREE TWO THREE TWO NINE WHAT'S WILL HELP TENANTS WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE BY REQUIRING LANDLORDS TO LET THEM. APPLY FOR HOUSING JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. I PREVIOUSLY HAVE SECTION EIGHT TO HELP ME PAY MY RENT. I WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL WHEN I RECEIVED MY SECTION. EIGHT I MY HOPE WAS THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO CREATE STABILITY FOR MY SON SO THAT HE WOULD NOT BECOME ANOTHER STATISTIC. HOUSING STABILITY ALLOWS KIDS TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATION -- WHEN I FIRST GOT MY VOUCHER I ONLY HAD TWO MONTHS TO LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT THAT INCLUDED THE ONLY ACCEPTING IT AND ME MOVING IN? I ENDED UP LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY APARTMENTS. AFTER I GOT MY VOUCHER I HAVE TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION SO THAT IT WOULD EXPIRE. I FOUND A PLACE BECAUSE NONE OF THE APARTMENTS. I COULD AFFORD. WOULD LET ME APPLY WITH MY VOUCHER. KNOWING THAT THE VOUCHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPIRE I WAS STRESSED SICK TO MY STOMACH I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME SLEEPING. I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS WHAT SEEM TO BE A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I FINALLY DID FIND AN APARTMENT THAT WOULD ACCEPT MY VOUCHER ON THE LAST DAY BEFORE IT EXPIRED. EVEN AFTER GIVEN THE EXTENSION I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO EXPRESS HOW OVER WITH JULY I FELT. I HAD FINALLY SECURED A PLACE THAT I COULD AFFORD AND WE WERE NO LONGER HOMELESS. HOWEVER ABOUT SIX MONTHS. AFTER MOVING IN WI EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE HOME INVASIONS. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT I REALIZE THAT. I NEEDED TO MOVE. TO A DIFFERENT HOME AND NEIGHBORHOOD TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY UNFORTUNATELY I COULDN'T FIND A NEW PLACE THAT WOULD ACCEPT THE VOUCHER. SO I GAVE UP MY HOUSING ASSISTANCE BECAUSE I WASN'T COMFORTABLE STAYING IN ANOTHER. DANGEROUS SITUATION IN ORDER TO USE IT. NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE AFTER SPENDING YEARS WAITING -- JUST BECAUSE A LANDLORD WON'T TAKE IT OR WON'T EVEN LET ME APPLY. PLEASE VOTE YES ON SB. THREE TWO NINE THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS I'M SUCH A HARD TIME WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY NINE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO EFFORTS TO ADDRESS -- RISING HOMELESSNESS WE RECENTLY SAW A DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES ACROSS THE STATE AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. THE BILL INSTITUTES A PROVEN SOLUTION BUT JUST -- PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AND BLANKET BANS AGAINST RENTERS WHO RECEIVE HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO HELP PAY THE RENT. AND WHILE IT APPLIES TO ALL HOUSING ASSISTANCE DISCRIMINATION THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS FOR THE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO RECEIVE -- HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER ALSO KNOWN AS SECTION. EIGHT THE BILL STILL ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO SCREEN APPLICANTS FOR CREDIT HISTORY RENTAL HISTORY ON THE LIKE A BUT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT THESE CRITERIA BE EVENLY APPLIED EQUALLY TO VOUCHER HOLDERS AND NON VOUCHER HOLDERS ALIKE. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- LIKE WE HEARD AFTER WAITING YEARS TO RECEIVE IT FAMILIES ARE INCREASINGLY FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO USE THEIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THESE BLANKET BANS. HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS REPORT THIS IS FRUSTRATING THEIR EFFORTS TO EXPAND RAPIDLY HOUSING DOLLARS AND KEEP FAMILIES -- OFF OF THE STREETS AND AND STABLE A HOUSE -- THIS ASSISTANCE GIVES OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES THE CHANCE TO LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY BY ALLOWING THEM TO SHOP FOR AN APARTMENT ON THE PRIVATE MARKET. THE FAMILY PAYS 30% OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS THEIR RENT AND THE GOVERNMENT PAYS THE REST DIRECTLY TO THEIR LANDLORD -- WHAT LANDLORDS CAN SET THE RENT OUT IS NOT DICTATED BY THE PROGRAM BUT FAMILIES SIMPLY NEED TO SHOP FOR AN APARTMENT THAT MEETS THE PAYMENT STANDARD ON THEIR VOUCHER -- MUCH OF OUR OPPOSITION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE INITIAL INSPECTION PROCESS WHEN A TENANT MOVES AND WHICH IS PERFORMED TO MAKE SURE THE UNIT MAKES BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. AND EVEN IF THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES TENANTS CAN STILL MOVE AND AS LONGAS THOSE CONDITIONS ARE LIFE THREATENING. AND LANDLORDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESSENTIALLY GET BACK PAY ONCE THOSE DEFICIENCIES ARE RESOLVED -- THE BILL WOULD BE ENFORCED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE D. FH ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT PROCESS WHICH IS GEARED TOWARDS MEDIATION AND SETTLEMENT. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN LITIGATION AROUND SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS IT'S TYPICALLY BEEN DONE BY PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS OR CITY IS SEEKING TO ADDRESS REPEATED VIOLATIONS AND BAD ACTORS -- SO WE DON'T EXPECT A HUGE INCREASE IN LITIGATION FROM THIS BILL. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY MINIMAL BURDEN FOR LANDLORDS AND A HUGE BENEFIT TO STRUGGLING FAMILIES WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE RESPECTFULLY RICHER IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU GO FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS SEVEN MEN TEN I'M WITH VOICES FOR PROGRESS MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND ALSO MANY OWN RENTAL UNITS WHO RAN TO SECTION.

GOOD MORNING THE CHAIRMAN THEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARL THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THAT IT'S NOT THE VOUCHER HOLDER IT'S A PROGRAM. IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT ADVERTISEMENTS OR APPLICATION. WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. BUT SOME RENTAL PROPERTY UNDER SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO PARTICIPATE FINANCIALLY OR OTHERWISE IN THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM REQUIRES JUST CAUSING FICTION IN ORDER TO TERMINATE BAD ACTING TENANTS. AND THERE ARE DELAYS AS A RESULT OF INSPECTIONS AGAIN WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH INSPECTIONS THAT HAPPENS IN ALMOST ALL CITIES TODAY. IT'S THE DELAY THAT WE OBJECT. TO YOU'RE NOW ALSO CITES A CASE IN WHICH THE VOUCHER HOLDER RAISE THE ISSUE OF STIGMA. WE DON'T AGREE HOWEVER THAT STIGMA EQUATES TO THE TRUTH ABOUT SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS BUT IT DOES EQUATE UNFORTUNATELY. TO INCREASED INSURANCE COST WE TRIED TO MOVE A BILL -- MISTER MAIENSCHEIN HAD YEARS AGO THAT WOULD STOP THIS PRACTICE -- ABOUT THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE INCREASE -- INSURANCE COSTS WAS REMOVED SOMETIMES WE SEE AS MUCH AS 20% INCREASES IN THE INSURANCE COSTS -- AND ESPECIALLY ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO TERMINATING A TENDENCY THERE'S INCREASED COSTS WHEN IT COMES. TO LEGAL FEES -- WE DISAGREE THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE. IF THE ONLY APPLICANT THAT COMES TO YOU IS A SECTION. EIGHT RECIPIENT. WE WOULD HAVE TO SIGN OR THE OWNER WOULD HAVE TO SIGN. A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS OR FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST. AND SUCCESSFULLY HOWEVER BUT WITH THIS BILL -- THERE WOULD BE INCREASED A MANDATE AND THERE WOULD BE INCREASED COSTS AS IT RELATES TO LEGAL FEES OF DEFENSE SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU EXODUS BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- RUN KINGSTON REPRESENTING THREE REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS ORANGE COUNTY EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. AND THE APARTMENT SO SHE XIN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CITIES WE TO JOIN -- THE OPPOSITION -- THIS BILL -- WE HAVE ASKED FOR AN AMENDMENT -- FROM THE AUTHOR. THAT THE REAL ESSENTIAL POINT HERE IS WE ARE NOT VILIFYING THE TENANT APPLICANT. IT IS THE PROGRAM THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY PROGRAM A CALL IT DOES CAUSE DELAYS WE'VE DOCUMENTED IT. TO THE DEGREE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS STATED AND THE PROPONENTS OF STATED THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW DELAYS LET ME WALK THROUGH AND THEN PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT -- THE AUTHOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS EITHER ZERO DAYS OR ONE DAY TO INSPECT. IT IS THE INSPECTION ONCE THE APPLICANT HAS -- APPEAR BEFORE THE PERSPECTIVE PROPERTY OWNER OR MANAGER -- IT IS THE THEN THE PROCESS BEGINS THE PROCESS DOES RESULT IN AN INSPECTION IF THERE ARE ANY CORRECTIONS AT ALL IT IS DONE INSTANTANEOUSLY. IT DOES TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS. TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IN MANY MANY JURISDICTIONS TO THAT A CELL. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SUGGESTING AND REQUESTING OF THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS. THAT IF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE DELAY ONE DAY TWO DAYS. FROM THE DATE OF COMPLETED APPLICATION THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD MEMORIALIZE THAT IN THE BILL. AND WHAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR IS AT THE VERY END OF THE BILL ON PAGE SEVEN LINES. NINE IS JUST SAY THAT IF AN APPLICANT -- IS ABLE TO OCCUPY THE HOUSING WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF OF AND OFFERED TO RENT. THEN -- THE PROCESS SHOULD ALLOW A SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT TO DO SO. DAD IT WOULD REALLY HELP IN SANTA BARBARA IT WOULD REALLY HELP AND ORANGE COUNTY IT WOULD REALLY HELP IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT CAN ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY TURN THIS AROUND. BUT WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT IT REALLY PUTS THE HOUSING% AUTHORITY AND THE INSPECTION PROCESS. AS A HIGH PRIORITY -- FOR FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THEY REALLY TRULY WANT TO GET THE APPLICANT SECTION EIGHT APPLICANTS IN THAT HOUSING -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT REALLY DOES SOLVE A SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM WITH THE BILL AND IF THE AMENDMENT IS ACCEPTED. THEN WE WOULD DROP OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CREAM THREE CM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND STRONG ADAM IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED A MANDATE NOW WHEN HE VETOED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN LAST YEAR -- HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE REGARDING OUR POSITION AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION INTERFERE WITH CAL CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. ALSO IN OPPOSING ESTIMATED POSITION PRECIADO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF ON A PROPOSED AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS PAT RIGHT WITH THEIR IN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS JUST KILEY. A CRISIS FOR CARBOCATIONS PROPOSED AMENDMENT -- AT HOW CAN THAT WE UNDERSTATE Là GIVE FEDERAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES A DEADLINE. FOR INSPECTIONS. THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. A HALF HOUR. IS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND ONCE IT IS HANDED OVER TO THE ADMINISTRATOR. THAT THEY SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED THE PROGRAM. AT SO CONSEQUENTLY JUST LIKE TODAY -- WHAT? REGARDLESS OF JURISDICTION LET'S PICK ON SACRAMENTO OR ORANGE COUNTY EAST -- SAN DIEGO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE ONCE THEY HAVE WITH THE BECOME ADMINISTRATOR. THEY DECIDE HOW FAST TO MOVE THE PROGRAM THEY ADMINISTER THE INSPECTION PROGRAM THEY SIGNED THE CONTRACT THEY DO EVERYTHING -- ADD TO THAT IS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE SOLUTION. TO THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF THE BILL. AND SO. MR KILEY WE HAVE. WRITTEN AMENDMENTS WE'VE SUBMITTED THEM TO THE AUTHOR OF THAT IS NOT TRUE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THOSE WITH THE MEMORY SAID MA'AM AND I RECEIVED AT FIVE TWENTY FOUR THIS MORNING IS NOT THE MEAN THAT YOU JUST RATTLE MY OFFICE NOR I HAVE RIGHT WE THAT WE ARE. NOT CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS SO IF I IF IF YOU DO WANT TO MAKE AMENDMENTS OR TALK TO THE AUTHOR. VIEW YOU'VE REGISTERED YOUR OPPOSITION YOUR DESIRE TO HAVE BUT WAIT IN DUE RESPECT WE DID DROP OFF THE AMENDMENTS WE LEFT HIM. TO YOUR STAFF. BY AND IT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO CRAFT THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT SO THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY THE ADMINISTRATOR JUMP ON THE ISSUE AND GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED. ALL RIGHT. POINTS BEEN MADE THOSE LIMITS ARE NOT CURRENTLY FOR THE COMMITTEE. THIS GALLAGHER [inaudible] SO -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOULD WORK. YEAH ON THE HYPOTHETICAL. I'M SORRY YOU SAY I'M YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DONE I APOLOGIZE FOR STEPPING IN SO THIS KAYLEE FINISH AND THEN WE'LL GO TO GALLAGHER WAS THE ONE THAT I CONCERN I HAD IS THAT. THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WILL REJECT THE USE OF A VOUCHER OF THE RENT IS DEEMED UNREASONABLY HIGH CORRECT SO. IN THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE SORT OF POLICY LOCALLY HAVE YOU SEEN YOU KNOW UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WHO IN ORDER TO AVOID TAKING -- SECTION EIGHT TENANTS WILL RAISE THE RENT IN ORDER TO MAKE -- THOSE UNITS NOT ELIGIBLE. WE HAVE NOT AND AGAIN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY TAKE SECTION EIGHT TENANT SO IT WOULDN'T AT AN UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORD WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO ACCEPT SECTION. EIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN -- IT AND IN AND IGNORED NUMBER OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE DENIED RENTAL INCREASES COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT THE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY REPORTS LIKE THAT OF MY ORGANIZATIONS BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE SORT OF DEFENDING SOME OF THE LOCAL POLICIES AGAINST CHALLENGES WHICH HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED. AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THESE LOCAL POLICIES AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD REPORTS FROM THE LEAGUE LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE SUPPORT ABOUT THAT PROBLEM. SORRY THIS GALLAGHER -- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK LIKE HOW THIS. NOW THE SKIN SUPPLEMENTED I MEAN IN THE IN THE LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY -- YOU KNOW. THE LANDLORD PUTS OUT APPLICATIONS. BUNCH PEOPLE THOUGHT THE APPLICATION NOT AN AD FEES APPLICATION RIGHT WELL LET'S SAY THEY DON'T DO ANALYSIS AT THE PUT APPLICATIONS IN. OUT FRONT. THIS RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF THEIR RENTAL FOR RENT RIGHT AND THEN PEOPLE COME BY AND FILL OUT AN APPLICATION RIGHT IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION. AND AND IF SOMEBODY PUTS ON THERE WELL I AM GOING TO ON THE APPLICATION I AM GONNA USE SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. WOULD A LANDLORDS A WALL I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO SECTION EIGHT SO I'M NOT GOING TO CHOOSE. THIS APPLICANT I'M GONNA CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD THAT BE PROHIBITED UNDER THIS BILL. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD SAY IS THAT IF -- MY VOUCHER IS -- A SOURCE OF INCOME. AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE APPLICANTS AND BY CREDIT CHECK -- IS EQUAL TO OTHER APPLICANTS MY INCOME INCLUDING THE VOUCHER IS EQUAL TO OTHER APPLICANTS THAT YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO CONSIDER MY APPLICATION AS YOU DO OTHER APPLICANTS WITH WITH WITH EQUAL. OF RELEVANT BACKGROUND SOLID BACKGROUND CREDIT HISTORY INCOME ALL IT SAYS IS THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER MY APPLICATION AS WELL THAT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY -- DENY MY APPLICATION BASED SOLELY ON THE SOURCE OF MY INCOME. SO WHAT IF ALL THINGS WERE EQUAL LET'S SAY ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL BUT USUALLY HAS YOUR TENANT YOU HAD. ONE ONE APPLICANT WHO IS SECTION A AND ONE WHO IS NOT. YOU CHOOSE YOUR TENANT. AND THEN I CAN CHU I COULD CHOOSE THAT TENET DOES NOT A SECTION EIGHT BECAUSE MAYBE I JUST. I THINK A LOT OF LANDLORDS ACTUALLY CHOOSE SECTION A BECAUSE IT'S GUARANTEED INCOME LIKE IT'S GET GOING TO GET PAID FOR IT RIGHT SO I THINK I'LL AND I THINK THE CONTENTION THAT SOMEBODY WOULD NEVER WANT TO SECTION EIGHT IS NOT REALLY TRUE. BUT BUT IF I CHOSE SOMEONE IS NOT SECTION. EIGHT IN MY OPENING THE DOOR TO LIABILITY OR AT LEAST SOMEONE BRINGING A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME. BECAUSE AS YOU SAID YOU DON'T WANT. TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE INTENT AS YOU WANT LANDLORDS TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT OR NOT MY INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS LIKE OUR WITNESS. HAS A FAIR SHOT AT FINDING A HOUSING SUITABLE FOR HER. MY INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SOLELY BASED ON THE SOURCE OF MY INCOME -- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SCAN -- ADS -- THAT THAT I THINK WOULD CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT SECTION EIGHT IT IS A COMMON THING TO SEE AN AD. TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH NO SECTION EIGHT YOU SEE IT ON SIGNS POSTED AS YOU SUGGESTED. ON APARTMENTS AND HOMES FOR RENT -- AND SO I I CHALLENGE AT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE BLANKET POLICY THAT THEY DO NOT ACCEPT SECTION. EIGHT AGAIN WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IF YOU HAVE -- MULTIPLE APPLICANTS AND LORD KNOWS TODAY THIS IS NOT A RENTER'S MARKET THERE MORE WINTERS LOOKING FOR UNITS IN THERE ARE AVAILABLE UNITS SO YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MULTIPLE APPLICANTS. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT I'M NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BASED ON MY SOURCE OF INCOME THAT YOU. INCLUDE ME IN YOUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS. YOUR ANALYSIS. CLEARLY STATES THAT IT IS NOT A MANDATE YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ME AS YOUR TENANT WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING THAT YOU INCLUDE ME IN YOUR OPTIONS OF PEOPLE YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOUR SELECTION FROM. READ BUT IF. IF LIKE WE SAID IN A HYPO IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS EQUAL. AND YOU'RE RIGHT OTHERWISE AND I'D AND I DON'T USE THE SECTION AM I NOT DISCRIMINATING AS A SECTION EIGHT PERSON BECAUSE I AM LOOK AT THE ONLY REASON I'M NOT CHOOSING THAT PERSON. IS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION. EIGHT RIGHT ON RIGHT I'M NOT SURE THAT YOUR ONLY REASONABLE IF WE HADN'T RAM IF YOU READ THEM IS IT A HYPOTHETICALLY OKAY. ALL RIGHT I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE EXISTING SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS RIGHT NOW -- THAT APPLY TO ALL OTHER FORMS OF OF INCOME WE JUST HAVE A SPECIFIC CARVE OUT FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET AN APPLICANT. WHO INTENDS TO PAY WITH WAGES FROM A JOB AND ANOTHER APPLICANT WHO INTENDS TO PAY WITH SOCIAL SECURITY? YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR DECISION. BUT YOU ARE STILL FREE TO CHOOSE AMONG QUALIFIED APPLICANTS AND DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF LIABILITY CREATED BY YOU KNOW THOSE PROTECTIONS -- AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT ON THE LIABILITY QUESTION IS THERE IS THIS ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT PROCESS -- AND SO EVEN IF SOMEBODY IS MAKING THE CLAIM THAT THAT WAS THE REASON FOR YOUR DECISION -- IT TYPICALLY GETS RESOLVED THROUGH. MEDIATION AND AND SORT OF AN INVESTIGATION PROCESS AT THE IDEA OF THE H. IT RARELY GOES TO LITIGATION. RIGHT -- MULLIN ALL THAT I MEAN OPPOSITION IF YOU WANTED TO RESPOND ANY OF THOSE POOR THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT -- IF THE ONLY APPLICANT AS I STATED EARLIER WERE THE SECTION EIGHT APPLICATION YET THE OWNER HAD NOT SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH YOUR LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. THERE PROBABLY WOULD BE A MANDATE THAT YOU GO DOWN TO SIGN THE CONTRACT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE KIND OF DIFFERING. YES IF THERE'S AN THE ONLY APPLICANT AND THE ONLY AFRICAN IS SECTION EIGHT AND YET I HAVEN'T SIGNED A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DO I HAVE TO SIGN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT. IF YOU SAY NO. WE'RE GOOD TO GO I'M A LANDLORD. AND WHEN I POST. A UNIT THAT'S OPEN THERE'S NO CUT OFF TIME AND SO I HAVE APPLICANTS THAT COME IN IN THE BUNDLE I HAVE MAY HAVE ONE THAT ARRIVES ON MONDAY. I MAY HAVE TEN THAT ARRIVE TUESDAY WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY SO THERE'S NO CUT OFF TIME SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU RECEIVED ONE APPLICATION. I CAN'T IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN THIS MARKET WHERE FOR RENTAL UNIT. THAT YOU GO TO RECEIVE ONE APPLICANT PERIOD SO WE'RE NOT SAYING. THERE'S NO CUT OFF TIME IF I UP LIST ON CRAIG'S LIST OR APARTMENTS DOT COM. MY UNIT. APPLICATIONS ROLAND CONSISTENTLY AND THEN I AS A LANDLORD MAKE MY DECISION ABOUT WHEN I WANT TO MAKE MY DECISION. AND SO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE ONE APPLICATION EXAMPLE I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS IT IS NOT LIKELY THE FIRST. IN THE DOOR THE FIRST QUALIFIED IS THE ONE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE THE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM. SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THE FIRST IN FIRST QUALIFIED IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR WEEKS. FINE BUT I THINK THAT THE QUESTION BECOMES WHERE IS THE LINE IT WHICH YOU FACE DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACCEPT THE FIRST INCOME THE FIRST QUALIFY AND I'M GONNA STOP THE BACK AND FORTH. GRANDSON QUESTIONS FROM FROM MEMBERS RIGHT I THINK IT HAS A POINT AND THAT THAT THAT IS A HYPOTHETICAL YOU CAN ANSWER THE THE SITE AND I THINK THE POINT IS. IT SEEMS TO ME IS THIS THE IT IT IT IT POTENTIALLY OPENS THE DOOR FOR MORE LITIGATION. FIRST IN FOR SOMEONE TO SAY WELL HEY I THINK YOU DIDN'T. ADD THAT THINK YOU DIDN'T READ TO ME BECAUSE OF THAT NOW THIS REASON. RIGHT. AND MAYBE YOU DIDN'T WRITE LIKE YOUR YOUR LANDLORD MAYBE YOU JUST SAID HEY I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL I DON'T REALLY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT SO. I'M CHOOSING THIS APPLICANT RIGHT BUT IF YOU GET SUED IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER YOU GOT OFFENDED. RIGHT [inaudible] I DISAGREE. CHUCK. PUMP I JUST WANNA GET A CLARIFICATION WHETHER OR NOT -- THE LANDLORDS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THAT THE SIGNED CONTRACT WITH LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO GET IT. IN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND AND AND A CLARIFICATION WHETHER OR NOT. THE THE LANGUAGE ARE REQUIRED TO DO. YOU KNOW ARE MANDATED TO SIGN A CONTRACT WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. RIGHT SO IF THE LANDLORD DOES CHOOSE TO RENT TO A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDER THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SIGN A CONTRACT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY -- A CONTRACT THAT SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO RESPECT TENNIS GREATS MAINTAIN THEIR UNITS SO WHAT DO THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT THAT LANDLORDS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO ON THE OTHER HAND IF DELYLAH DOES NOT TILL WISH. TO OUR RENT THAT PLACE TO TO THAT PARTICULAR POTENTIAL TEN AND THEN THERE'S NO NEED TO DO SO. RIGHT. YEAH IT'S ONLY ONCE ONCE THEY HAVE ACCEPTED A SPECIFIC TENANT THEN THERE IS A CONTRACT THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT PERSON'S LEAKS. THE QUESTION THIS FEATURE NORTH. SORRY JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT QUESTION IS THAT HOW IS THAT ALSO YOUR INTERPRETATION. THAT IS NOT YOUR INTERPRETATION. OKAY SIR. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND SOME OF THIS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS CREATES A MANDATE SO. THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS SAYS THIS DOES NOT CREATE A MANDATE DEPOSITIONS INTERPRETATION AND INDEED JERRY BROWN'S INTERPRETATION OF A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WAS THAT IT CREATED A MANDATE. HI I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO RECONCILE THAT PERHAPS IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHY YOU THINK IT DOES CREATE A MANDATE. AND THEN THE AUTHOR CAN TELL US WHY SHE PLEASE IT DOES NOT CREATE A MANDATE. AGAIN ON ON A HYPOTHETICAL. NOT SAYING THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS ONLY HAVE ONE APPLICANT BUT IF WE DO HAVE ONE APPLICANT. AND I'M WILLING TO SAY EXCEPT SECTION NAY BUT I HAVE NOT SIGNED A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT NOR DO I WANT TO SIGN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT. THERE WILL BE A LAWSUIT. THAT'S WHAT OUR CONCERN IS SO WE SAY THAT IS A MANDATE. DOES THAT HELP. SO THERE'S ONLY AND I MANDATE EXISTS ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S A SINGLE APPLICANT OR AMENDED EXISTS IN OTHER AGAIN WE WOULD STAND FIRST QUALIFIED EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT AND HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOREVER. IF YOU'RE GONNA WAIT AND HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOREVER I WOULD ARGUE AGAIN THERE'S LEGAL LIABILITY BECAUSE YOU WAITED. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT EXCEPT THAT FIRST APPLICANT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO SIGN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT. I WOULD HAVE YOU MIGHT HAVE THREE COMING IN BEHIND IT BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE IT OPEN UNTIL THERE IS NO SECTION EIGHT APPLICANTS. THERE'S GONNA BE LEGAL LIABILITY. NUYS CA ARE AGREES WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER'S ASSESSMENT NOW WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS ON THIS ISSUE -- AN INTERESTING FACT FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE -- IS THAT -- A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE TO PERFORM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES OR OR MEMBERS DEAL WITH THIS ON A DAILY BASIS -- AND WHAT THEY'VE TOLD US THE FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THEM IS THAT EVEN IF YOU GET MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS. YOU STILL HAVE TO PICK THAT OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT OR RISK FACING LITIGATION AND SO THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A VERY MURKY WORLD -- IN THE LANDLORD TENANT SPACE -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHY GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO IT LAST YEAR [inaudible] OKAY. THEN MAY I RESPOND YEAH. FIRST OF ALL I SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND AND I BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION AND THAT THAT WAS NOT A BILL THEY SUPPORTED. EITHER SO I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S BEING REFERENCED -- TODAY -- IN REFERENCING YOUR COMMITTEE NOW WITH THIS PAID SIX SB THREE TWO NINE WOULD NOT FORCE IN THE LANDLORD THE CONTRACT WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. IT IS NOT A MANDATE -- I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WE'VE HAD THE ANALYSIS IN INTO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARINGS -- OUR OUR SPONSORS ARE CO SPONSORS -- FEAR LA AND LISTINGS THERE ALONG POVERTY -- HELPED DRAFT THE LANGUAGE OF WHO APPLYING THE SAME IT IS NOT OUR INTENT. TO CREATE A MANDATE IT IS NOT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ABOUT SPRING TOLD HOLD ON HOLD ON WE'RE NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH HERE. THIS REGION OR DID YOU GET YOUR AND YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED. YES THANK YOU AND I JUST DON'T WANT ONE OTHER QUESTION REGARDING. AT THE INSURANCE ELEMENT ZERO THAT'S A GOOD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AS I SOMEBODY MAN MENTIONED. OUR COLLEAGUE MR MAN SHINE. POSSIBLE AND THERE IS A PEACE THERE THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY PROHIBITED INSURANCE COMPANIES. FROM. JEAN HIGHER RATES TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ACCEPTED SECTION EIGHT NOT. PIECE ACTUALLY FELL OUT OF THAT LEGISLATION SO. NOW IN SHORT WHILE STE WE'RE SAYING WE DON'T WANT PROPERTY OWNERS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SECTION [inaudible] EIGHT APPLICANTS WHO. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO OFFER HIGHER RATES ARE -- DEMAND HIGHER RATES A SECTION. EIGHT PRINTER I'VE PROPERTY OWNERS FIRST OF ALL AS IT LANDLORDS I'VE NEVER BEEN ASKED BY MY INSURER YOU HAVE IF I HAVE SECTION EIGHT TENANTS. THAT'S DELIVERED IN MY EXPERIENCE AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND A BEFORE. FOR SEVEN THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY BARRED FROM ASKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER HOUSING ASSISTANCE IS ACCEPTED BY A PROPERTY OWNER. SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE INFERENCE COMES THAT YOU HAVE INCREASED INSURANCE UNLESS THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT. FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THE UNIT IS -- VACATED OR OR DAMAGE IN THE UNIT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT. WHY THEY FEEL YOUR INSURANCE RATES WOULD BE INCREASE BASED ON A BEFORE? FOR SEVEN GOT IT AND JUST QUICKLY THE OPPOSITION. WHY DO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS? THINK THAT YOU'RE GETTING CHARGE HIGHER INSURANCE RATES. UP BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND THEY LOOK AT OUR WEBSITES DECEIVE SECTION EIGHT IS ALLOWED THEY OFFER COPIES OF CONTRACTS. THEY MAY NOT INSURANCE INSURANCE COMPANIES ABSOLUTELY IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MAY BE ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THEY DON'T BUT THE LARGE COMPLEXES THEY ABSOLUTELY DO. THE NEARBY. SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE VIOLATING THE LAW. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN. SO I I'M A LITTLE IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUILD ME -- AND AS I AM. IT HAS A MISTER GALLAGHER VICE CHAIR POINTED OUT. OUGHT TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT STAND BEHIND IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING -- AND I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF TENANTS WHO NEED GUARANTEES. SO YOU HAVE A TENANT. MAYBE IT'S YOUNG PERSON OUT THE GATE THEY ARE JUST STARTED WORKING GOOD JOB. BUT THEY NEED -- THEIR PARENTS TO A SIGN ON AS GUARANTORS TO THE LEASE BEING PAID HOUSE. THAT MAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE THE SECTION EIGHT IS A IS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS% BASICALLY STANDING BEHIND THE TENET. AT ENSURING THAT THE LANDLORD WILL BE PAY -- IF I'M A LANDLORD AND I'VE GOT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD WHO. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PERSON GOOD CANDID -- HAS A GOOD INCOME AS A MAYBE WORK LONG ENOUGH HASN'T ESTABLISHED ENOUGH CREDIT. MAYBE I DESIRE. TO HAVE A PARENT AND IS A REAL LIFE SITUATION MY DAD JUST. THIS LAST YEAR SO ONCE THE PARENTS SIGNED ON HE WAS GOOD TO GO. SO I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED WHY. THIS IS BEING VIEWED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN HOW YOU WOULD PROBABLY INTERPRET -- THAT THAT SITUATION TO ALL THE OTHER DAY. SHIPS THAT THIS WHOLE BILL IS TURNING. NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT A MANDATE. THEN WE WOULD SUGGEST. AMEND THE BILL. TWO SO STATE THE SECOND PART IS NOT ANSWERING THIS HOLDEN'S QUESTION. I THINK THE QUESTION WE HAVE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GUARANTOR AS A PARENT. OF THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE WHERE'S THERE'S EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES OF REGULATIONS INVOLVED THERE'S JUST BECAUSE EVICTION AND YOUR YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT. YOUR PARENTS NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN THE JUST CAUSE EVICTION REQUIREMENTS -- AND RIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES OF THE GUARANTOR RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE -- UNFORTUNATELY -- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ARE OUR PROBLEM IS YOUR PARENTS ON TO COME WELL MAYBE THEY DO THOSE THOSE HELICOPTER PARENTS MAY COME AND INSPECT THE THE PROPERTY BUT YOU STILL DO HAVE THE INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS THE DELAY REQUIREMENTS SIX ADDRESS AND I THINK. AGAIN IT'S NOT THE APPLICANT IT'S NOT THE HIGH SCHOOL OR THE COLLEGE STUDENT IT'S THE PROCESS. MISTER CHAIR IF I MIGHT. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YES OR YOU MAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE THING THAT WE WOULD SAY WITH RESPECT YOUR QUESTION IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- SECTION EIGHT OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING ON AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN LAST YEAR -- AND LANDLORDS NOW HAVE TO TAKE CASH EQUIVALENT VOUCHERS FROM THIRD PARTIES ON BEHALF ATTENDANCE WE'RE ABLE TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH WHEN WITH VOUCHERS AND SECTION. EIGHT IS THAT SECTION EIGHT DOES COME WITH A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY AND OTHER OWNERS REQUIREMENTS -- INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS - THE HOUSING AUTHORITY -- GETS DETERMINE THE THE RENT INCREASES EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PASSED THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. WHICH FOR SOME LANDLORDS AS YOU INDICATE IT'S GUARANTEED INCOME SO FOR SOME LANDLORDS THEY LOOK AT THAT IS A BENEFIT IN THE CHOOSE TO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE MARKET IS A MARKET RATE THAT THEY WOULD BE PAYING. NOW. NO. A HOUSING AUTHORITY -- TYPICALLY IT WITH RESPECT TO RENT INCREASES IN THIS IS SOMETHING% THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE IS PROBLEMATIC GOING FORWARD WITH RESPECT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH ARE NEUTRAL ON BECAUSE WE SEE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A BALANCE BETWEEN. TEN PROTECTIONS AND ALSO ALLOWING THE LANDLORD A FAIR RATE OF RETURN IF THIS BILL WERE ALSO TO GO THROUGH -- AND THEN EFFECTIVELY FORCE IN OUR ESTIMATION EFFECTIVELYFORCE PROPERTY OWNERS PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT YOU COULD HAVE AN INSTANCE WHERE YOU HAVE A SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS. YOU KNOW AN ELDERLY COUPLE DOWN ANOTHER SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. AND THEY GET AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SUCH NEED APPLICANT THEY HAD TO TAKE THAT APPLICANT THEREFORE SEND THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. AND IT HERE TO ALL THOSE OWNERS REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING PASSING THROUGH ALL RENT INCREASES AND SO WHILE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS CURRENTLY SET AT 7% PLUS CPI. HE COULD HAVE AN INSTANCE WHERE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY SAYS NO. WE'RE JUST GOT WHICH HAVE CPI OR CPI PLUS ONE AND THAT COULD BE EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC FOR SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS -- AND SO WE SEE THAT IS SORT OF CREATING A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE MARKETPLACE -- WHICH IS WHY IN OUR ESTIMATION ASECTION IT SHOULD REMAIN VOLUNTARY BECAUSE WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY THAT'S WHETHER IS THAT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION. AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WHAT DO? FIRST I I MEAN THIS BILL HAS DOES NOTHING TO IMPACT WHETHER NOT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM OR NOT. IT IS NOT A MANDATE. NOT ONE SPEAK TO THE ELEMENTS OF THE OTHER BILL THAT'S NOT MY BILL AT THE BILL THAT'S ON THE TABLE TODAY -- THE BILL IN CHIEF IS CLEAR AS REFERENCE BY TWO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THAT YOU PROPOSALS AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT IS -- WE INTERPRET THAT AS A POISON PILL I DON'T HAVE TO PUT INTO IT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHEN THE BILL ALREADY IS NOT A MANDATE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT'S WHY AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I'M NOT ACCEPTING THAT AMENDMENT LANGUAGE. NOT THE MINUTE LANGUAGE YOU READ TODAY WHICH I HAVEN'T SEEN BUT THE ADDITIONAL A LANGUAGE YOU -- FOR SUGGESTED WE INTERPRET THAT AS A POISON PILL. THE BILL IN CHIEF IS NOT A MANDATE [inaudible] WITH THE SO AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- THIS DISCUSSION ON MANDATE WHAT I'M HEARING IS THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING. IT. WHETHER IT SAYS IT'S A MANDATE OR NOT -- YOU WOULD ADVISE AS RENTER LANDLORDS. TO TREAT IT LIKE A MANDATE -- TO AVOID LEGAL LIABILITY. THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING SO THAT IS A DECISION AS LEGAL ADVICE THAT SHE WOULD GIVE TO LANDLORDS TO TREAT IT LIKE A MANDATE BUT IT'S NOT A MANDATE. NOW HOUSING DISCRIMINATION LAWS SO -- YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE THE FIRST APPLICANT RIGHT YOU'RE JUST NOT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO NOT VIOLATE. DISCRIMINATORY LAWS CRACKED. WELL AGAIN THE ARGUMENT COMES BACK DOWN TO LEGAL LIABILITY FIRST IN FIRST QUALIFIED IS THE LEGAL -- TO AVOID A LEGAL CHALLENGE YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I MEAN I DON'T ITEM PRACTICE AND THAT'S THE MODEL LANDLORD WAS A TENANT FOR A LONG TIME -- THERE. YOU CAN MAKE CHOICES BETWEEN MULTIPLE APPLICANTS. CRACKED I MEAN IF YOU. YOU DON'T LITERALLY I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE WHICH ONE CAME OVER THE FAX MACHINE FIRST STORE WHICH EMAIL CAN I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU KNOW. I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE OF IF IT'S LIKE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE GET FIVE OR SIX APPLICATIONS ALL ON THE SAME DAY RIGHT. AND YOU MAKE A DECISION. AND IT JUST CAN'T BE. BIASED BY CERTAIN FACTORS THAT ARE YOU'RE PROHIBITED FROM USING AGAINST AN APPLICANT OKAY. SO IF A LANDLORDS NOT DISCRIMINATE DEAN ON THOSE FACTORS THEN -- THAN THEIR LEGAL LIABILITY IS IS NONEXISTENT. IS THAT CORRECT UNLESS I REFUSED TO SIGN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WHERE ARE WE THEN. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH I REFUSED TO SIGN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PART OF THE MANDATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD ASKED. FOR OKAY AND THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL. IS THAT DIFFERENT OKAY. I SEE THIS BILL THIS AND I AND THIS IS WHY I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS BUT I SEE THE BILLS THIS. I THINK SECTION EIGHT IS CODE FOR SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT SO WHEN I SEE A TIME TO BE REALLY HONEST WHEN I SEE A SIGN SAYS NO SECTION -- EIGHT YOU DON'T SEE THAT MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE EVERYBODY WHO'S RENTERS BLACK OR BROWN RIGHT. YOU SEE IT IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE -- I'M SORRY I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE. WHAT PEOPLE THE LANDLORDS ASSUMPTION IS ABOUT SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS SO I'M DOING THIS BILL AND I COULD BE WRONG I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR? AS A WAY TO TO AVOID THAT IN GIVE. OPPORTUNITY TO A VOUCHER HOLDER TO PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE LANDLORD GIVE THEM ALL THE REASONS I HAVE I HAVE INCOME AND AND PERHAPS BREAKDOWN SOME. PEOPLE'S VIEWS ABOUT WHO. WHO HAS TO RELY ON SECTION -- EIGHT THIS MANDATE PART I I UNDERSTAND. FEELING LIKE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ASSUME YOU'RE MAKING DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS IT'S LIKE WELL THEN DON'T MAKE DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS. BUT I'M I'M I'M CONFUSED -- WHITE IT'S CALLED A BEING CALLED A MANDATE. WHEN IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S JUST MORE BREAKING DOWN THAT -- YOU CAN'T HAVE THE EXCLUSION OF IT MIGHT DOT. IS THAT HOW THE AUTHOR SEES THE BILL I'M KIND I'M JUST KIND OF CONFUSED AT THAT I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY OKAY POINTS IN THE THE OPPOSITION. IS CHARACTERIZING IT IN A NARROW. AS A POTENTIAL MANDATE UNDER HYPOTHETICAL AND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS SAYING. IS SORT OF IN THE REAL WORLD THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AND TO MR GALLAGHER'S POINT. IF THERE ARE A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IN FRONT OF A LANDLORD AND LANDLORDS SAYS I AM NOT RENTING TO THIS PERSON SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEY HAD THEIR BRINGING SECTION. EIGHT THEN THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF LAW UNDER THIS BILL. IF EVERYONE ELSE IS BEING TREATED EQUALLY. WHETHER THEY'RE BLACK BROWN WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE FINDING IT OR SEX IT IS FINDING IT. AND THEY THEIR AGNOSTIC TO ALL OF THOSE DISCRIMINATORY FACTORS. THE CORRECT OR PICK A TENANT AND THAT TED IS QUALIFIED THAN. THEY'RE DONE. AND ALSO I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THAT AT THE IF THE H. FOR VIOLATIONS WHICH IS A FIRST STEP FOR ANY DISPUTE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF LITIGATION THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR OF LITIGATION THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR FOR THESE DECISIONS BUT THE REALITY. IS THIS IS A COMPLEX WORLD AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH THE BILL IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE WHICH I AGREE WITH THAT I AGREE THAT IT IS NOT A MANDATE. BECAUSE THAT. LANDLORD HAS THE ABILITY TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN AND TO TO MAKE DECISIONS BUT IF THAT DECISION IS MADE. EXPRESSLY BECAUSE OF A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER UNDER THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL OTHER THAN THAT THEY HAVE [inaudible] BROAD DISCRETION. THIS GALLAGHER AND HOW IT IS A VERY QUICK I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WITH THE BILL THOUGH RIGHT IS IT FOR SAYING THAT. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHOICE TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT OR NOT. AND YET ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL YOU DECIDE -- I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. AND WORSE AND WE'RE SAYING HEY IF YOU DON'T MAKE THAT CHOICE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE. LIABLE. THEN THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE RIGHT OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT THEMSELVES LIABILITY THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT THE BILL SAYS THE BILL SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T DENY ME FROM APPLYING THE BILL DOESN'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY. YOU MUST SELECT ME THE BILL THANK YOU COULD NOT DENY MY APPLICATION. YOU CAN'T HAVE A SIGN THAT SAYS NO SECTION. EIGHT AND IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVE TWO APPLICANTS THREE APPLICANTS. WHATEVER [inaudible] THAT. ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL IN TERMS OF BACKGROUND CHECK RENTAL HISTORY WHAT EVER YOUR CRITERIA IS AS A LANDLORD TO MAKE YOUR DECISION. THAT YOU SIMPLY DON'T GIVE ME A DEMERIT BECAUSE OF THE SOURCE OF MY INCOME. AND THAT I'D BE. INCLUDED IN YOUR POLL FROM WHICH TO SELECT FROM. MISTER JARRETT CLUB PLEASE THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION ASK NO. BOB MS RESTED YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. NOT TO LONG AGO IN THIS COMMITTEE WE TALKED ABOUT THE VETERANS HOUSING VOUCHERS I THINK MOST OR DISCUSSION TODAY HAS BEEN ON SECTION EIGHT THIS ALSO INCLUDES A VETERANS HOUSING VOUCHERS. AND WE HEARD THE SAME DISCUSSION -- WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT VETERANS? VOUCHERS THAT. THE MANY LANDLORDS DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THOSE BECAUSE AGAIN OF THE THE THE THE ALL THE THE THE CONTRACTS AND ALL THE THE ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED. IF THE ANALYSIS AND I AGREE WITH THEM IS GONZALEZ. I MEAN I I'VE BEEN A LANDLORD FOR DECADES -- AND WHAT. IN MY COMMUNITY THERE ARE THERE ARE RIGHT I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THE SIGN NO SECTION. EIGHT BUT I CAN SEE HOW IT WOULD BE. PUT IN FROM ELSE'S. SIX SUSPECTED TIME WHAT'S IS NO MEXICANS OR NO BLACKS ARE NO NO WELL FOR NOW I SOCIETY. I THINK THIS THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK IT CHANGES. HOW WE VIEW PEOPLE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODYFROM SO THAT THE HAS A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WITH LIMITED INCOME? MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POOR PERSON WHO AT THIS TIME NEEDS TO HAVE THE SYSTEMS AND THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE A SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS IT WE'VE A WAITING LIST FOR SECTION. EIGHT FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE YOU WILL FINALLY GET THAT SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. THE FACT THAT WE ARE SAYING LANDLORDS. WE CAN'T PUT THAT SIGN UP ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT ALREADY BEFORE YOU EVER YOU VALUE WAITED ANYBODY YOU CAN'T SAY I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE A SECTION A PERSON. BECAUSE GOING BACK TO WHAT MS GONZALEZ SAID YOU KNOW WHAT A SECTION EIGHT THE EVERYBODY HAS A VISION OF WHAT SECTION EIGHT MEANS. AND I DARE SAY THAT WHATEVER WE THINK OF SECTION. EIGHT IF WE HAVE A GENERALIZATION IT'S NOT A GOOD. ONE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE SO WE'RE WE IF WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE AS LANDLORDS TO SAY. YOU CAN STILL SAY TO START OFF THE TOP NEVER WILL ACCEPT SECTION. EIGHT WE'RE ALLOWING THEM. TO DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST SOMEONE WITH A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. OR A VETERANS HOUSING BELCHER OUR VETERANS WITH THOSE VOUCHERS THOSE ARE COVETED VOUCHERS FOR VETERANS AND THEY ALSO HAVE. A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING SOMEBODY TO RENT TO THEM. PERSONALLY AS A LANDLORD OF YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. I LOVE IT WHEN WE HAVE A SECTION EIGHT TENANT BECAUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA SAID IT'S A GUARANTEE YES THERE CUT THE GORE THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN YES THEY'RE GOING TO INSPECT. YES THEY MAY HELP US FIX A FEW THINGS. BUT IT IS A GUARANTEE ON THAT RENT [inaudible] I I APPRECIATE THE SENATOR BRINGING THIS THIS BILL FORWARD. NOT ONLY FOR THE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS BUT ALSO FOR OUR VETERANS WITH A HOUSING VOUCHERS WHO. TOO OFTEN FIND THAT. THE HOUSING THAT IS ALREADY LIMITED IS NOW EVEN MORE LIMITED TO THEM.

OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS. THREE NORTH IRIS. THREE FIVE THREE THESE THREE MORE WE WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN [inaudible] SENATOR WILK. ITEM NUMBER ONE SB TWO OH TWO MORNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR IN YOUR FIND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME MY OFFICE AND ALL THE INTERESTED PARTIES. ON A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS. PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH I BELIEVE ACTUALLY STRENGTH AND THE INTENDED FOCUS OF THE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT APPRECIATE IT. I. S. B. TWO OH TWO IS A MUCH NEEDED MEASURE TO PROVIDE STABILITY TO THE VETERINARY MEDICAL WORLD. CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE NATION IS CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM A SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD PRODUCTS. WHEN A DOG IS GRAVELY INJURED OR SUFFERING FROM A LIFE THREATENING ILLNESS THEY OFTEN NEED EMERGENCY BLOOD FOR TRANSFUSIONS? BUT THE BLOOD SHORTAGES ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF ANIMALS EVERYWHERE IN FACT I NOTICE COMMUNITY BY MANY PEOPLE IS A ROBIN BLACK. WHOSE DOG NEED A TRANSFUSION AND SHE WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH PLASMA AND HER DOG DIED ON THE ON THE DRIVE OUT TO DAVIS. TO TO TO TO SAVOR DOG SO WITHOUT A HEALTHY BLOOD SUPPLY AVAILABLE FOR SICK OR INJURED ANIMALS MANY OF OUR DOGS CATS AND OTHER BELOVED PETS. MAY DIE RATHER THAN TO GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED. THIS IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE SO SB TO A TO PROVIDE AN EASY FIRST STEP TOWARDS FIXING THIS PROBLEM. BUY A BUY OUT BY ALLOWING FOR COMMERCIAL LICENSE YEARS OF COMMIT A COMMUNITY SOURCED ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS. THIS MEAN ANIMAL OWNERS WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOLUNTEER THEIR PETS TO GIVE BLOOD AND I'M LIKE YEAH JUST LIKE THE WAY. PEOPLE GET A VOLUNTEER TO GIVE BLOOD EVERY OTHER STATE CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING AND HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY A METHOD. TO GUARANTEE SAFETY FOR ALL ANIMALS AS BE TWO OH TWO WOULD ENSURE THAT BLOOD COLLECTIONS HAPPEN UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A VETERINARIAN MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA ONLY LICENSES CLOSED COLONIES BLOOD BANKS WHICH KEEP ANIMALS CAGE ON THEIR PREMISE FOR FOR YEARS ON END AND THEY'RE ONLY TO THESE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. GIVEN OUR SHORTAGE OF BLOOD PRODUCTS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE MODEL IS CRITICAL THAT WE EXPAND DOG PLASMA BY ADDING COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING TO ENSURE. WE HAVE AHEAD THAT WE HAVE HAPPY DONORS AN ADEQUATE BLOOD SUPPLY FOR DOGS IN NEED. HOW WITH ME I HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES IN? BECAUSE THE TIME I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG MORNING I'LL LET THEM SELF IDENTIFY AS HE TESTIFIED. WILL BE BUT WILL BE VERY VISIBLE OUT THANK YOU CHAIR STONE. HELLO MY NAME IS JUDY MAY INCLUDES ON THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION PROUD SPONSOR OF SB TWO OH TWO WE THANK SENATOR WOKE FOR CARRYING THIS LIFESAVING BILL. I SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD FOR OVER EIGHT YEARS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ALONG WITH SENATOR WILK STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF WITH INPUT FROM BOTH BLOOD BANKING VETS AT UC DAVIS AND PROFESSIONALS FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. AND THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE THIS BILL GOOD FOR ALL PARTIES. FOR THE BLOOD BANKS FOR THE CALIFORNIA VETS AND FOR THE DONOR AND THE RECIPIENT ANIMALS COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS WILL ADD TO THE MUCH NEEDED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY IN THE STATE. AS WELL AS MATCHING OTHER STATES BY NOT KEEPING ANIMALS IN CAGES JUST TO BELIEVE THEM IT OPENS UP A REVENUE SOURCE FOR VETERINARIANS AROUND THE STATE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HUMANE TYPE OF PRACTICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE -- AGAIN MY NAME IS DOCTOR HOW THE RALLY I AM THE SUPERVISING VETERINARIAN AT A FOUNDATION -- AS WELL AS ADJUNCT FACULTY VERMONT LAW SCHOOL. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE CURRENTLY WHERE IT'S LEGAL FOR VETERINARIANS TO OBTAIN ANIMAL BLOOD PRODUCTS FROM COMMUNITY BASED ON OUR PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO SELL THAT BLOOD TO OTHER VETERINARIANS. STATE SENATE BILL TWO OH TWO WOULD CHANGE THAT IT WOULD CREATE A LARGER MORE RELIABLE SUPPLY OF THESE LIFESAVING BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR DOGS IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. THIS BILL IS A WIN FOR VETERINARIANS FOR PATIENTS ALSO FOR CITIZENS WHO WANT THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR BELOVED PETS AND FOR THE DONOR ANIMALS THEMSELVES. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS ARE ARE THRIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE THE NORM RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION OWNERS VOLUNTEER THEIR DOGS WHO LIVE IN LOVING HOMES WERE SCREENED FOR DISEASES AND OTHER HEALTH. AILMENTS -- TO HELP OTHER DOGS REQUIRING BUT PRODUCTS DUE TO TRAUMA SURGERY ANEMIA OR OTHER DISEASE. RECIPIENT WATSON VETERINARIANS BENEFIT FROM THE SAFE SUPPLY OF BLOOD PRODUCTS WHICH THERE'S A CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY SINGLE DOG DESERVES TO LIVE IN A LOVING HOME AND DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO LIFESAVING VETERINARY CARE IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND IT IS ACHIEVABLE WITH SB TWO OH TWO THIS BILL WOULD ALSO UPDATE CURRENT LAW. BY ALLOWING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS IN VETERINARIANS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S INSPECTION REPORTS FOR THESE BLOOD BANKS BE UP PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. PLEASE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT PRESS BE TWO OH TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU AND ALSO IN SUPPORT USE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIKE DILLON REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORT AND ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. WOULD BE PROUD CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION OUR INTEREST IS REALLY LIMITED TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT PIECE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. LISA AVERY FROM LAGUNA BEACH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANKS THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. CNN IS THEIR OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SEPARATELY **** GREENBERG TRAURIG ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK. ARE THE OPPOSITION NOTES THAT ANIMAL BLOOD BANK HAD CONCERNS WITH THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE AMENDMENTS TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO OPPOSE -- WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH ALL ALL SPEAK JUST TO TWO OF THEM TODAY. THE FIRST IS THAT BORE THE THIRTY SOMETHING ODD YEARS THAT. ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS HAVE BEEN LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA THE LICENSING LAWS REQUIRED A QUALIFIED PERSON IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A LICENSE THIS BILL. WOULD CHANGE THAT TO A LICENSED VETERINARIAN NEITHER OF THE TWO BANKS THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA -- THE ONLY TWO THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED OF EVER BEEN OPERATED BY LICENSED VETERINARIAN IT'S NOT NECESSARY ALLOWED COST. IN ADDITION THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY REQUIRE THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THAT LICENSED VETERINARIAN. WHICH IT IS A LITTLE VAGUE I WOULD SAY BECAUSE IT SIDES TO ALL OF THE VETERINARY PRACTICES ACT WHICH USES THAT WORD. THROUGHOUT -- BUT IT DOES SEEM TO REQUIRE -- PRESENTS -- AND AND RATTLED READY AVAILABILITY -- TO DRAW BLOOD FROM AN ANIMAL THAT'S NOT NECESSARY YOU DON'T NEED A DOCTOR TO TAKE BLOOD FROM THE HUMAN THEN YOU DON'T NEED OF THAT TO TAKE BLOOD FROM. AN ANIMAL. THE SECOND CONCERN WE HAVE HAS TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT -- THE CHAIR OF OF I THINK IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENATE JUTISH -- ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO EXEMPTED ALL RECORDS FROM DISCLOSURE -- THERE IS THE SAME NEED TODAY TO PROTECT -- THE IDENTITY OF FOLKS WHO. WORK WITH BLOOD BANKS BECAUSE NOT ALL BUT SOME IN THE ANIMAL RIGHTS COMMUNITY -- RESORT TO LEGAL MEASURES. NO NO LESS RECENTLY THAN A FEW WEEKS AGO SIX HUNDRED ACTIVISTS STORMED A DUCK FARM AND SAID NO MY HUNDRED WERE ARRESTED. THAT'S THE KIND OF INTIMIDATION THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST AND THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED BECAUSE THE RECORDS HAVE BEEN PROTECTED. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT CDFA SHOULDN'T BE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT BLOOD BANKING ON THE PROGRAMS BUT THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS AND OTHERS AS THE BILL GO FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MR TEAR KERN A CAROLING OTHER THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW FOR SUFFICIENT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTABLE. THE ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS ANIMAL SHELTERS IN CALIFORNIA TOOK THE POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED JUST BECAUSE THIS IS NEW AND THEY WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING IT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOUR STAFF SO KILEY WALKED US THROUGH ONE BY ONE LAST WEEK I BELIEVE MOST OF THE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED HERE. AND THE REST WILL HOPEFULLY BE ADDRESSING AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE. AGAINST SUPPORTABLE CONCEPT THAT THIS IS A VERY TOUGH SUBJECT MATTER FOR ANYBODY WHO LOVES THEIR DOG -- BUT WE ARE HOPING TO GET TO A NEUTRAL OR SUPPORT POSITION ONCE WE GET THERE ASSEMBLY OUR CULTURE WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SCOUTER [inaudible] YES SO. WE DO NOT. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SO I MEAN THESE ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS OR I THINK VITALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IF YOU EVER HAVE -- A PROBLEM WITH YOUR PET -- AND THEY AND THEY NEED BLOOD -- AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S ONLY HAVE TWO OF THESE. IN THE STATE. I A I AM SUPPORTIVE OF OF THE CONCEPT OF OPENNESS UP ALLOWING FOR THE COMMUNITY. AT ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS AS WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S THANK YOU THAT COULD HELP EXPAND MORE. OPPORTUNITIES -- OBVIOUSLY TO HAVE THIS RESOURCE -- BUT THE ONES THAT ARE HERE RIGHT NOW PROVIDE A VERY VITAL RESOURCE. THAT ALL OF US WOULD WANT TO HAVE IF OUR PET [inaudible] NEEDED. YEAH IT WAS IN THAT DIRE SITUATION -- SO. I I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING. TO YUP UNDULY INTERFERE WITH. YOU KNOW. THE INDUSTRY THAT WE HAVE -- IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW -- AND I GUESS MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP -- BY THE OPPOSITION IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE OPEN TO THIS CONCEPT A WITH AS WELL BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR ISSUES ARE. DO WE NEED TO HAVE DIRECT VETERINARY SUPERVISION. I MEAN I THINK AS HE SAID YOU KNOW ME WHEN I GO AND GET MY BLOOD DRAWN I'D I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DOCTOR SUPERVISING ME -- AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE WAS ABOUT ALL THE CRACKERS AND PUBLIC RECORD ME AND I GUESS MY QUESTION NOW BE I MEAN DO WE DO THIS AND OTHER. CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE OPEN UP. WHAT IS OTHERWISE A PRIVATE BUSINESS? TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REVIEW AND I GUESS MAYBE IT IS ONLY A PUBLIC ACT RECORDS ACT REVIEW FROM THE DEPARTMENT. RIGHT THE PUBLIC DEPARTMENT THAT HOLDS THESE RECORDS ARE AT RIGHT CORRECT GO AHEAD. SENATOR SO THE FIRST ONE WE'VE BEEN HAVING -- DIALOGUE THE WHOLE TIME WITH MISTER LEE **** AND FRANKLY HIS CONCERNS THEY LAID OUT ON ISSUE ONE WE'RE GONNA BE ADDRESSING IN THE AG AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE. TO DO IT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I RESPECT THE CHAIR FOR YOU KNOW JUST. WORKING IN HIS AREA OF JURISDICTION A LINE THAT TO THE AG COMMITTEE SO I'M ASSUMING WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT RESOLVED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TERMS OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE AND ONLY HAS TO DO WITH THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMALS -- THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIALLY MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY OUT THERE AND THE REASON WHY THEY'RE SO -- THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES IS BECAUSE THERE THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY AND SO WE'RE JUST. MAKING ADVANCE WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE -- INFORMATION ON THAT THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMALS AND FRANKLY I THINK MORE TRANSPARENCY ACTUALLY HELPS TO SEND INDUSTRY DOES NOT HINDER IT SO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND THIS IS TOUGH. I HAVE A VERY BRIEFLY I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- IT'S NOT TYPICAL TO EXPOSE -- LICENSING AND INSPECTION RECORDS -- AND IT IS TYPICAL -- TO PROVIDE AGGREGATED DATA BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN ISSUE IN THIS INDUSTRY WHERE THERE ARE ONLY TWO COMPETITORS -- AND FINALLY I I WOULD SAY THAT THE IN ORDER TO BE LICENSED AN APPLICANT HAS TO PROVIDE THE PROTOCOLS WHICH IS BASICALLY THE STEP BY STEP EVERY ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS IT'S A ROAD MAP FOR COMPETITORS AND OTHERS -- TO COMPETE WITH THEM AND WE THINK THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE DISCLOSED EITHER SO THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIC THINGS WE WANT TO PROTECT OTHERWISE -- I I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO AGREEMENT ON THAT OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES. THIS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY AND WE DID NOT HAVE THOSE BUT THOSE P. R. A. PROVISIONS IN THE REGINALD VERSION OF THE BILL -- SENATOR JACKSON CHAIR OF THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE -- IMPOSE THEM. I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT -- BUT IF WE CAN REACH AN ACCOMMODATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO HAPPY TO DO THAT MY POINT IS THIS IS THAT WE WANT TO IT IF. WE WANT EXPAND. THE BLOOD SUPPLY AND WE WANT TO DO IT IN A LOVING AND YOU CAN MORE HUMANE WAY AND AND AGAIN FORTY NINE OTHER STATES HAVE THIS. METHOD WHO ARE THE ONLY ONE WE ALWAYS BRAG IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING ABOUT HOW WE'RE THE FIRST WELL WE'RE THE LAST ON THIS. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S LONG OVERDUE THIS REFORM. BOB SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS KIND OF WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES OR TALK THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CNN SATURDAY MAY CLOSE.

CURRENT LAW ALLOWS TRANSGENDER CALIFORNIA'S TO PETITION COURTS TO CHANGE THEIR NAME AND GENDER TO CONFORM TO THEIR GENDER GENDER IDENTITY. THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THAT PERSON'S OLD BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO BE SEALED AND A NEW ONE ISSUED AS AN ORIGINAL TO BOTH PROTECT THAT PERSON'S PRIVACY. AND RESPECT THEIR IDENTITY HOWEVER THERE'S NO PROVISION A LOT AS TO THE TREATMENT OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE'S MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES AND THE BIRTH CERTIFICATES OF THEIR CHILDREN. SB SEVEN FORTY ONE WOULD SIMPLY ONLINE THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE'S MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES AND THE BIRTH CERTIFICATES OF THEIR CHILDREN WITH THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING THEIR OWN BIRTH CERTIFICATE. HERE TEST TO TESTIFY WITH ME IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK GOODNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS PUNIT PER WALL ONCE AGAIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA PROUD SPONSORS OF SB. SEVEN FORTY ONE AM BUT IS FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM AMIRA HASS AND BUSH WHO RUN THE LAW FIRM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS. AND FAMILIES AMIR WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND TODAY BUT THE US THAT I SHARE A FEW POINTS WITH THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. IN THE LAST YEAR AMIR WORKED WITH THE CLIENT TO AUST IF SHE COULD MODIFYHER CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO REFLECT HER HUSBAND'S GENDER HE HAD RECENTLY TRANSITION TO MAIL. ALL AMERICAN TELLER CLIENT WAS THAT IT WOULD COST MORE MONEY AND YOU CAN GUARANTEE AN OUTCOME THE COUPLE CHOSE NOT TO MAKE THE CHANGE AT ALL. AND SO THE FATHER IS STILL LISTED ON THE CHILD'S MOTHER ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. A YEAR AGO ANOTHER CLIENT TIRED AMIRA TO COMPLETE HER NAME AND GENDER CHANGE. AMIR A FINALLY RECEIVED CONFIRMATION THAT THE CLIENT RECEIVED HER AMENDED MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE ELEVEN MONTHS LATER IN ORDER TO GET HER CLIENT A NEW MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH THE OLD ONE SEALED AND WITHOUT IDENTIFICATIONS OVER FORMER NAME. AMIRA DRAFTED AND SUBMITTED A LEGAL MEMO TO THE COURT HAD A FORMAL HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE FILED A SEPARATE MOTION BOB THOUGHT ORDER -- FOR PARTIALLY APPROVED SENT THIRTY EMAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH VITAL RECORDS MADE COUNTLESS PHONE CALLS AND TOWED A VERY CAREFUL LINE BETWEEN BACKING AND INSISTING. ULTIMATELY SUCCEEDED ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESERVOIR RESERVOIRS TO HIRE PRIVATE COUNSEL IN A MERE DOESN'T THINK THAT HER CLIENT OUTCOME. COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE ADVOCACY OF A LAWYER. FRANKLY AMIR NOTES. SHE WASN'T EVEN INITIALLY SURE THAT SHE COULD DO IT. AND SHE'S NOT SURE THAT EVERY LAWYER -- COULD EVER LAWYER COULD GET THE SAME OUTCOME. THIS PROP THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE PROCESS THE CHANGE A SMALL. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT IN THE FIX IS VERY SIMPLE. CALIFORNIANS OF TRANS EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR LEGAL NAME AND GENDER FLECKED ACCURATELY ON OLDER ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GALGIANI FOR HER ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SB SEVEN FORTY ONE AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SERVE ON A JURY. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THEY COULD BE A MEMBER OF THE BAR IF THEY WERE -- TO SO FORTUNATE. TO PASS THE BAR. THEY COULD PRACTICE AS LAWYERS THEY COULD DO ALMOST MOST. MOST THINGS. IN OUR STATE EXCEPT THEY HAVE A LIFETIME BAN ON SERVING ON A JURY WHY. BECAUSE EACH OF THEM. WAS AT ONE POINT IN THEIR LIVES. SIR HAD A FELONY CONVICTION. WHAT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS LIFETIME BEYOND? WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS. 30% OF CALIFORNIA'S BLACK. MEN RESIDENTS. ARE NOW EXCLUDED FROM EVER SERVING ON A JURY DUE TO THIS LAW. THE VERY PRINCIPLE. OF JURY SERVICE. IS A JURY OF YOUR PEERS. IF WE ABSOLUTELY. FOR A LIFETIME. EXCLUDES 30%. OF THE BLACK MAN WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. HOW IS IT THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THERE TO BE A JURY OF THEIR PEERS? ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE PROFILE OF WHO IS USUALLY IN COURT. AS THE DEFENDANT. I'M NOW ALLOWS ME WITNESSES TO A I'VE GOT A PROFESSORS DONE A GREAT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON THIS SUBJECT PAULA CHEESE -- IF YOU DON'T MIND WANT TO BEGIN AND THEN WILL. USERS. THAT'S RIGHT THE FIRST FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. IN A SHIRT UP MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR JAMES BUT ALL. IT STILL SOUNDS LITTLE PRETENTIOUS WHEN I SAY THAT SO I APOLOGIZE -- TO START I JUST WANT THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TAKE PART IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING THE EXCLUSION OF CONVICTED FELONS FROM JURY SERVICE IS A TOPIC I THINK IT WARRANTS THIS FORUM AND I APPRECIATE OBVIOUSLY BEING PART OF THE DISCUSSION. SO I'M CURRENTLY A TENURED ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW CRIMINOLOGY CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. I'M ALSO PRACTICING ATTORNEY -- IN A CONVICTED FELON. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE A BECAUSE THE D. Y. ACCIDENT THE CLEAN THE LIFE MY PASSENGER WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND. I SUBSEQUENTLY SPENT FOUR YEARS ONE MONTH SIXTIES INTO MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISONS. WHILE INSIDE I TOOK MY LSAT FROM MY PRISON CELL IN THE HOPE OF ONE DAY GOING TO LAW SCHOOL. BUT MY RELEASED TWO THOUSAND FOUR BEGIN MY LEGAL STUDIES FOUR YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I WAS AMID THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR EMBARKED ON A LEGAL CAREER. AS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY ALL WHILE PURSUING MY PHD. THAT SENIOR WAS SOME TO JURY DUTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE COURTHOUSE IN THE DAY MY SERVICE I PASSED THROUGH SECURITY USING THE DESIGNATED ENTRANCE FOR ATTORNEYS. I FELT A STRANGE SENSE OF PRIDE IN PRIVILEGE AT THAT TIME. SOON THEREAFTER COURTHOUSE PERSONAL STRUCK ME TO COMPLETE A JUROR QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE IT USED TO BE NUMBER SEVEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT NUMBER IS NOW. ON THAT QUESTION THERE WAS AN INCREASE REGARDING CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS -- WHETHER I'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR MALFEASANCE IN OFFICE I ANSWERED YES. WHAT'S UP TURNING IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CALLED FOR THE JURY Là ANDREAS STRUCKER BY THE JURY COMMISSIONER. THAT WAS PERMANENTLY INELIGIBLE FOR JURY DUTY AND I WOULD NEVER BE CALLED AGAIN. I PROTESTED MILEY EXPLAINING I WAS AN ATTORNEY HAD USED THE SPECIAL ENTRANCE OUT AND WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD WRITE MY REPRESENTATIVE IF I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S JR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. STATE OF READING MY REPRESENTATIVE I EMBARKED ON A TEN YEAR RESEARCH AGENDA FOCUSED ON THIS TOPIC. I OFFICE BACKGROUND BY WAY OF EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW WHY SPENT THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE STUDYING A TOPIC. THERE WAS HE'S VERY LITTLE SCHOLARLY LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION I ALSO OFFICE BACKGROUND TO ILLUSTRATE THE FIRST OF SEVERAL CONTRADICTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES THAT PLAY A PRACTICE. KNOWN AS FELLOW INJURE EXCLUSION. AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA'S ONE TWENTY A JURISDICTIONS THE BAND CONVICTED FELONS FROM JURY SERVICE PERMANENTLY CALIFORNIA'S FELON JR EXCLUSION STATUTE IS CATEGORICAL. BARRING ALL CONVICTED FELONS REGARDLESS OF OFFENSE TYPE FROM BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES. JUSTIFYING THE STATUTE COURTS IN LAWMAKERS ALLEGE THE CONVICTED FELONS. THOSE LIKE ME WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE JURY PROCESS BECAUSE WE PURPORTEDLY LACK CHARACTER. IN HARBOR INHERENT BIAS MAKING US ADVERSARIAL TOWARD THE STATE IN ON TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. IN MY RESEARCH I HAVE EXPLORED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO LEAD THESE RATIONALES FOR FALL INJURE EXCLUSION. I'VE ALSO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE PRACTICE SPECIFICALLY I'VE ANALYZED HELPFUL INJURE EXCLUSION INFLUENCES COMMUNITIES. AND HOW IT INFLUENCES THOSE SYSTEM IMPACT AND CITIZENS TO FALL PREY TO THE EXCLUSION. ONE ONE OF MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THIS IDEA OF CHARACTER AND THE CLAIM THE CONVICTED FELONS OF ALLOWED TO SERVE WOULD SOMEHOW TATE THE DELIVERED OF PROCESS. TO DO SO I CONDUCTED THE FIRST MOCK JURY STUDY EVER INCLUDED FELLING JURORS AND NON FELL INJURES RESULTS INDICATE THE CONVICTED FELONS APPROACH DELIBERATIONS THOUGHTFULLY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY. ON TO THEORETICALLY DERIVED MEASURES OF DELIBERATION QUALITY TIME SPOKEN AND RECOLLECTING HER RECOLLECTION OF CASE FACTS EXCUSE ME FILLING JURORS OUTSCORED THEIR NON FILLING COUNTERPARTS. WHEN ALL THE MEASURES OF DELIBERATION QUALITY FOLGERS IN NON FELL INJURES DID NOT DIFFER STATISTICALLY? THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THE CONVICTED FELONS AT A MINIMUM DO NOT UNDERMINE IN MAY IN FACT ENHANCE JURY DELIBERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY JURISDICTIONS A BAR US FROM JURY SERVICE MAY I NECESSARILY DISCARDED VALUABLE VIEWPOINT IN THE JURY'S QUEST FOR JUSTICE. THE CHARACTER RATIONALE ALSO FACES THE CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGE AS I ALLUDED TO THE START OF MY TESTIMONY CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF TWENTY NINE JURISDICTIONS WHICH A CONVICTED FELON CAN SUCCESSFULLY BECOME A MEMBER OF STATE BAR. BUT IS FOREVER EXCLUDED FROM THE JURY POOL. THIS IN MY OPINION STRETHES THE BOUNDS OF LOGIC. WHILE BOTH LEGAL ROLES REQUIRE UP STANDING MORAL CHARACTER CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR THE PROSPECT OF REDEMPTION IN THE CONTEXT OF ENTRY TO THE LEGAL PROFESSION. GET IGNORES THAT POSSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO JURY SERVICE A CRUCIAL CIVIC COMMITMENT. SO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WELL I CAN DEFEND A CITIZEN FACING THE ULTIMATE PENALTY DEATH. I AM NOT PERMITTED NOT TRUSTED ENOUGH BY THIS STATE TO DECIDE EXAMPLE IN THIS PLACE FENCE. OR IMPROPER EASEMENT. SIR I DO NEED TO WRAP UP PLEASE SURE. I WANNA SAY ONE THING ABOUT CRIMINALS ASSISTANCE IF I MIGHT IN INTERVIEWS WITH SALINGER'S IN THE ONLY JURISDICTION THAT ALLOWS CONVICTED FELONS TO SERVE STATE OF MAINE. WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT SUBJECT SPOKE OF THEIR INCLUSION IN JURY SELECTION AS CORROBORATION OF THE REFORMATION? BOASTING ABOUT THEIR VALUES POTENTIAL JURORS THE STROKE TO LIVE UP TO THE IDEAL JUROR ROLE. THESE THINGS THIS INCLUSION TRIGGERED CRIMINALS ASSISTANCE MECHANISMS. I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT I SAW THANK YOU AGAIN FOR RECOGNIZING WHAT I CONSIDER REALLY INVISIBLE FORM OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT -- AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY RESEARCH THEN THERE'S A LOT MORE OF IT. THANK YOU THIS SERVICE PLEASE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS OSCAR BOB WROTE I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION HAS APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN ITS MEMBERSHIP. I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS. I'VE TRIED CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED JURY TRIALS. AND I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE TRENCHES -- IN DEFENDING CLIENTS. IN OUR CURRENT JURY SYSTEM. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES I AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE WITNESSED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY PROSECUTE IN OUR COURTS. MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. IN THE POPULATIONS IN POPULATIONS OF OUR STATE. DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE CONVERSE OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY TRUE IF YOU WALK IN ANY CRIMINAL COURT. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUMMONED TO SERVE AS JURORS DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTS CAUCASIAN RESIDENTS IN ALMOST EVERY COMMUNITY AND UNDER REPRESENTS WITH -- CLEAR CONSISTENCY THE SAME POPULATIONS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. DESPITE THIS. EXISTING FOR DECADES AND THIS PHENOMENA BEING EXPOSED IN OUR TRIAL COURTS IN IN OUR PELA COURTS AND DECISIONS ABOUT IT. NOTHING'S BEEN DONE TO CHANGE IT AND IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE USED TO LIST ONLY TO LIST -- CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES WHICH REQUIRES A OF EVERY TEN YEAR. RE DOING OF OF YOUR LICENSE STATUS OR YOUR IDENTIFICATION STATUS AND REGISTER VOTERS WHICH DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO REGISTER THOSE ARE THE LIST. THAT WE SUMMON JURORS FROM. AND THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THOSE LISTS UNDER REPRESENT. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS IN THE STATE IN THE JURY POOLS. THIRTY THREE OTHER STATES IN THE UNITED STATES USE LISTS IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO LISTS. CALIFORNIA IS WAY BEHIND THE TIMES IN REGARD -- TO WHERE WE ARE IN OUR JURY SELECTION PROCESS -- I I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU HOW DISHEARTENING IT IS TO WALK INTO A COURTROOM WITH A CLIENT WHO HAS PROFESSED HIS INNOCENCE AND AGAIN I WOULD REMIND THAT THE THE GROUP HERE THAT. A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE CASES THAT ARE FILED END UP BEING JURY TRIAL IT'S A IT'S AROUND 223% STATE WIDE. BUT THOSE CLIENTS THAT DO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL IN -- REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC DEFENDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OTHER CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS. WHEN THEY WALK INTO A COURTROOM THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A JURY OF THEIR PEERS AND TO SIT DOWN AT COUNSEL TABLE AND SEE THAT PANEL COME INTO THE COURTROOM AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE TO BE? OF JURORS OR TO BE A PART OF THAT ROOM AND TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE ONE TWO OR NO FACES THAT MATCH THE FACE OF YOUR CLIENT. IT'S DEVASTATING FOR YOUR CASE IT'S DEVASTATING FOR YOUR CLIENT AND IT DESTROYS THE MEANING OF A JURY OF ONE PEER ONE'S PEERS. SO I ASK YOU AS THE THE COAST SPONSOR OF THIS BILL TO SUPPORT SB THREE TEN WHICH WOULD INCLUDE STATE TAX FILERS WOULD INCLUDE -- FELONS TO SERVE. AND AND TO SUPPORT SKINNER CENTER SKINNER'S COURAGEOUS EFFORT TO CHANGE THE WAY WE SOME INJURES IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RACHEL WELLS ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA PART CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- DER CYPRIAN SENOR GUNNERS WERE ALL OF US KNOWN AS STRONG SUPPORTER SB THREE TEN THANK. AARON HANEY ON BEHALF OF CUT FIFTY IN STRONG SUPPORT. LONDON CROWDED WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN STRONG SUPPORT. ASHLEY CARTER ON BEHALF OF KERR FIFTY AND ALL OF US ARE NOT IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL MENDOZA WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COLLISION STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MR AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE LARRY MORSE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS DRAFTED WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE. BUT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY CONSTITUTED WOULD REPLICATE ONE STATE IN ONE STATE ONLY WHICH IS THE STATE OF MAINE WHICH CURRENTLY ALLOWS -- FELONS WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS TO SERVE ON JURIES -- THAT MEANS THAT PAROLEES. PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ON PROBATION OR HAVE SOME SORT OF A TAIL ATTACHED TO THEIR RELEASE -- TO NINETY REGISTRANTS -- YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY UNDER THE THE TERMS OF THIS BILL HAVE A PERSON ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON JURY WHO IS RECENTLY PAROLED FOR CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN AND IS SERVING -- OR IS OF REGISTERED -- TO NINETY DEFENDANT. WE ARE CITY A A IS WILLING -- TO BRING CALIFORNIA INTO THE NUMBER OF STATES THAT DO ALLOW -- FELONS TO SERVE CURRENTLY IN MORE THAN HALF THE COUNTRY RIGHT AT ABOUT HALF THE COUNTRY FELONS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SERVE. IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM FELONS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SERVE -- WE RECOGNIZE AND APPLAUD SENATOR SKINNER FOR BRINGING CALIFORNIA INTO THE LIST OF STATES THAT -- WILL ALLOW FELONS TO SERVE WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED ARE WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS ON THAT SERVICE AS OR IN PLACE IN ALMOST EVERY STATE THAT ALLOWS FELONS TO SERVE. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE PROPOSED THAT -- NO FELON WHO WAS ON PAROLE. BE ALLOWED TO SERVE ON A JURY -- FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON YOU COULD LITERALLY BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A JURY TRIAL I LIKE MY COUNCIL OVER HERE IS PROSECUTOR AND TRIAL ATTORNEY FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. YOU COULD HAVE A PERSON -- LITERALLY ON A ON A JURY BE VIOLATED FOR A PAROLE VIOLATION DURING THE MIDDLE OF A TRIAL -- FOR EITHER A PAROLE VIOLATION OR PROBATION -- WE WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL -- NOT PERMIT PAROLEES OR ANYONE WITH THE TAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT IN FACT FREED FROM CUSTODY FROM COMPLETE CUSTODY THE STATE STILL HAS -- AUTHORITY OVER OVER THESE PEOPLE WE'VE ALSO ASKED FOR A FIVE YEAR WASHOUT PERIOD WHICH WOULD BE IN THE FIGHT FOR FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO SERVE AS JURORS. THAT THEY REMAIN FREE FROM -- CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND WE HAVE ASKED THAT -- TO NINETY REGISTRANTS -- NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE AS WELL -- MOST OF THESE. DISCUSSIONS WILL IN THE WAY JURIES TRIALS WORK -- WHEN YOU? COME IN THE JURY COMES IN AND THE JUDGE ALMOST ALWAYS WILL TELL THE PROSPECTIVE JURY IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU YOU WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY. PLEASE LET THE COURT KNOW AND WE WILL ADJOURN INTO CHAMBERS AND THEN YOU CAN TELL OFTENTIMES. IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE OR A RAPE CASE ONE OF THE JURORS HAS BEEN A VICTIM. HIMSELF OR HERSELF OR HAS A CLOSE CONNECTION TO IT -- SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT. OF SOME OF THESE FOLKS WHO ARE FELONS ELIGIBLE TO SERVE WOULD WANT TO DISCUSS THAT IN THE PRIVACY OF CHAMBERS WITH THE JUDGE -- HOWEVER NONE OF THE OTHER JURORS ARE GOING TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE SITTING THERE ARE SPENDING WEEKS AND POSSIBLY MONTHS NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A SERIOUS. CRIME OF VIOLENCE -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AWARE OF ANY. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR REASONABLE. ACCOMMODATIONS REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS WE ARE NOT OPPOSED -- IN ITS ENTIRETY TO THE SENATORS BILL WE APPLAUD HER -- FOR INITIATING THIS DIALOGUE BUT WE THINK THAT THERE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE RESTRICTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ADOPTED -- IN ORDER -- TO PURSUE THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS WITNESS WITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST RAIN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION LIKE TO CONCURRENT COMMENTS. MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DISK TURNS SO SEE XIN AND ALSO NOTE THAT PROPER COURT SECURITY REQUIRES CONSTANT MONITORING OF THE ACCUSED. THE WITNESSES THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL VISITORS MEMBERS OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OF SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE ALL WHO COME TO COURT. SB. THREE TEN WILL MAKE OUR MEMBERS JOB MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BY MIXING VIOLENT FELONS ON PAROLE WITH DUTIFUL CITIZENS WHO HAVE WILLINGLY CHOSEN TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS ARE NOT PERFECT. BUT HAVING CONVICTED FELONS AND PAROLEES SERVICE JURORS. WILL FURTHER UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC SAFETY INTEREST IN OUR COURTS AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE IN THE NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COME ASSIST KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD FIRST OF ALL ON THE THE TAX FILING. THE INCREASE IN THE POOL AT NOTS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AS WE KNOW AND IS INDICATED TO A VERY WELL IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT USING JUST THE DMV AND VOTER ROLLS EXCLUDES. A LARGE SWATH OF OUR POPULATION VERTICALLY LOWER INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR AND AGAIN I THINK THE GOAL IS TO HAVE. A JURY THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY -- IT INTO WHICH ARE BEING IMPANELED -- AND WE KNOW THAT OF HISTORICALLY THAT'S REALLY NEVER BEEN THE CASE ALTHOUGH THAT THINK WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK HAVING THE TAX FILING STATUS IS DEFINITELY A MOVE. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- TO INCREASE APPLE AND YOU KNOW HAVING WORKS ADOPTED PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THAT IN YEARS AND IN PANEL DANGER IS MYSELF -- I WILL SAY THAT -- FIRST OF ALL -- BUT ANYONE THAT IS ON PAROLE OR PROBATION -- THAT SHOWS UP FOR JURY SERVICE AND IS WILLING TO DO THEIR CIVIC DUTY AS CITIZENS -- WE SHOULD APPLAUD THAT WE SUPPLY THE FACT THAT THEY WANT TO BE BE INTEGRATED AND REHABILITATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO PARTICIPATE. EVEN IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. THAT LED THEM TO THE CONVICTION. I THAT'S IN SOME WAYS A TRUST IN THE SYSTEM THAT MANY OF US DON'T EVEN HAVE. THAT THAT MAY NOT HAVE TONY CONVICTIONS. LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT SOMEONE COULD BE EXCUSED -- BUT IT'S THERE -- A PART OF THE JURY POOL -- CERTAINLY FOR BIAS -- BUT IF HE IF A FABLE UP. IS ONE THAT HAS A FELONY CONVICTION -- BUT CHOOSES TO REVEAL BY S. CLEARLY -- THEY'LL BE EXCUSE JUST LIKE A VICTIM OF A CRIME ALTHOUGH I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT VICTIM OF CRIMES IMPANELED. AS A AS PART OF A JURY BECAUSE THEY'VE INDICATED THEY THEY DON'T THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BIAS THAT THEY CAN BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL AND IF THE ONE THAT HAS A CONVICTION CAN INDICATE THAT THEY'LL BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. THEY SHOULD BE IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE NOW THEY CAN STILL BE EXCUSED -- BUT YOU KNOW BY A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE -- AND ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS I KNOW WASN'T NESTLE DISCUSSED YOUR BILL WAS REFERRED TO IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS HARDSHIPS -- MANY MANY JURORS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOM JURORS DO NOT SERVE BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. AND I THINK THAT BY EXPANDING THE POOLOF THOSE THAT PRESUMABLY. WOULD BE LOWER INCOME BUT BUT THE SERVING JURORS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAY HAPPEN ANY CONVICTIONS ARE EXPANDING -- THE ABILITY TO HAVE A JURY THAT ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT IS ON TRIAL. AND SO I I THINK THAT YES YOU KNOW THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF FEAR THAT COULD BE SEWN INTO THIS BUT THE REALITY IS. THAT -- IF WE TRULY WANT TO BELIEVE -- AND ONE DOES THAT GET RELEASED TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON GETTING RELEASED THEN WE SHOULD OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE. IN THE SAME MANNER THAT WE DO SO MANY OTHERS AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT STEP PRESS THE TAKEN CALIFORNIA'S BEEN BEHIND. I THINK IT'S OKAY IF WE TAKE A STEP IN ACTUALLY BEING A LEADERSHIP ROLE OF IT AT THIS TIME AS WELL. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THIS CHIP. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BEING SUCH A STALWART CHAMPION FOR PROGRESSIVE COLONEL JUSTICE REFORM I THINK OF SUPPORTING YOU AND EVERYTHING -- THAT YOU HAVE PUT FORTH I WILL SAY AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED AS A FORMER DA THIS BILL DOES GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN -- WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS SET THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S WRITTEN IS THAT -- PROSECUTORS WILL USE THEIR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES -- TO STRIKE -- FELONS WHO ARE IN THE JURY POOL I AND AT SOME LEVELS -- IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISADVANTAGE -- THE D. A.'S AND SO -- AS WE DISCUSSED I'M WILLING TO PROVIDE YOUR COURTESY VOTE TODAY MY HOPE IS THAT THE TWO PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO TO DISCUSS THIS I KNOW. THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AROUND -- POTENTIALLY ALIGNING -- THE REQUIREMENTS HERE WITH VOTING REQUIREMENTS I THINK THAT IS -- AN INTERESTING PATH TO CONSIDER -- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE DISCUSSION I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING HERE -- BUT I I DEFINITELY HOPE THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND REYES TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE THE IMMEDIATE HANDICAPPING OF THE PEOPLE STATE A CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES -- TO SELECTING JURORS [inaudible] THIS FEATURE. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AS WELL -- BUT I I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE ARE THE SENATOR TO CONSIDER SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS AT THAT WE HEARD TODAY I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE. THANKS MUCH. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW. FIVE MEN MIGHT RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THOSE COMMENTS AROUND THE AMENDMENTS -- WELL IT'S STRUCTURE CLOSER YES YOU MAY [inaudible] OKAY. I'M AS MISTER MORRISON MORSE FROM THE DA ASSOCIATIONS INDICATED MY OFFICE SANDAY ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSION -- WE CALIFORNIA. VOTING RIGHTS. BUT EXTEND. TO PERSONS WHO ARE FORMERLY CONVICTED OF A FELONY BUT WHO ARE NO LONGER ON ROLL. ON NOT SURE IF IT'S ALSO PRO OR PROBATION OR PURCHASE ONE BUT WHAT I AM WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING IS AND I'M VERY OPEN TO POTENTIALLY. MODIFYING THE BILL SO THAT IT REFLECTS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR VOTING RIGHTS. NOW THE OTHER ISSUES AROUND -- EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF OF PEOPLE I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF WE RAISE FOR EXAMPLE. THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE IF WE HAVE A PERSON WHO WAS -- HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT FELONY WE COULD HAVE VIOLENCE IN THE COURT ROOM. DID THE REALITY IS THAT -- NOT ALL VIOLENT PEOPLE. ARE ARRESTED OR CONVICTED -- AND STEW. FOR US TO ASSUME THAT EXCLUDING ONE CATEGORY WOULD SOMEHOW GUARANTEE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE PEOPLE ON JURIES THAT HAVE A TENDENCY TOWARDS VIOLENCE IS A VERY INACCURATE NOTION -- ALL THAT THE FELONY CONVICTION REPRESENTS IS THAT THAT PERSON WAS ACTUALLY -- CONVICTED -- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S IF THERE'S MUCH VIOLENCE THAT NEVER EVEN GETS REPORTED AS A CRIME SO -- AND ADDITIONALLY IF WE TAKE THE THE THE REFERENCE -- TO IT'S THE REGISTRY OF SEX OFFENDERS. WE COULD HAVE MANY RAPISTS THAT ARE SITTING ON A JURY POOL BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF REPORTED RAPES IS SO TINY. AS TO BE ABSURD NOW I DON'T BRING THAT UP TO SAY THAT I WELCOME A RAPIST ON A JURY POOL NO. BUT I'M BRING IT UP BECAUSE OF THE ABSURDITY THAT BY EXCLUDING PEOPLE THAT WERE CONVICTED OF A FELONY WE ARE PROTECTING IN ENSURING THAT OUR JURY POOL IS -- ONLY REPRESENTS PRISTINE LAW ABIDING RESIDENTS WHICH OR CITIZENS WHICH WE KNOW IT DOES NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NEVER REPORTED AND NEVER CONVICTED SO I JUST RAISE IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO JUST LOOK ACCEPT THE REALITY OF OUR SOCIETY AND CULTURE -- NOW THE BILL DOES AS WAS MENTIONED EXPANDS THE LISTS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR A WIDER JURY POOL BUT I WILL COMMIT. TO THE COMMITTEE THAT I WILL CONTINUE MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DA ASSOCIATION I AM SURE THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT I WILL BE WILLING IN MY SPONSORS WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL BE -- ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE DA'S CONCERNS BUT I WILL DEFINITELY -- IN GATE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AND TAKE THOSE THAT I THINK HAVE HAVE A STRONG PUBLIC SAFETY RATIONALE. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I CHU.
