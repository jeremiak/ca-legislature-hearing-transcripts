00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:02.414
THAT HAS LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.481
TO GIVE AWAY.

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:05.583

THESE DEALS TAKE MONEY FROM

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:11.189
EVERY CITY IN THE STATE.

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.223
AND THEY GIVE IT TO SOME OF THE

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.224
RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.660

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:17.162
UNDER THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.297
LOCAL SALES TAX LOST SALES TAX

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.765
REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.300
POINT OF SALE.

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.568
NOW FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:24.602
THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:25.770
REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION IN

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.072
WHICH THE STORES LOCATED PRETTY

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:28.606
CLEAR.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.308
BUT ONLINE RETAILERS AND WE ALL

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.676
KNOW HOW.

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:33.044
MORE AND MORE THAT -- FOLKS

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:34.913
REASON ONLINE HAVE THE ABILITY

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:37.115
TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:38.550
SALES TAX REVENUE.

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.151
THAT COULD BE A WAREHOUSE IT

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.619
COULD BE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.121
IT COULD EVEN BE A SALES OFFICE.

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.856
THIS ALLOWS COMPANIES TO DIRECT

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:46.491
REVENUE TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.159
IN THE STATE.

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:49.427
NOW COMPANIES USE THIS AS

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:50.929
LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WITH

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.564
THE LOCATE AND A CERTAIN PLACE

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.798
IN THE STATE.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:54.899
AND THE RESULT OF THAT MY

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:57.602
FRIENDS IS IS BEEN A RIG PROCESS --

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.070
DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.338
INCREASINGLY.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.006
ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:04.008
IN EXCANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:04.876
BUILDING.

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.578
OR RELOCATING IN THEIR

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.947
JURISDICTION.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:11.349
UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.017
I THE COMPANY'S PROFIT BOTH FROM

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.587
THEIR ONLINE SALES AND FROM THE

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.088
SALES TAX REBATES.

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.123
OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.924
COMPANIES MORE THAN HALF OF THE

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.826
SALES TAX REVENUE.

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:23.361
ALLOCATED TO THEIR JURISDICTION.

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.063
HE'S COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.898
EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC.

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.433
AT A TIME WHEN CITIES ARE

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.568
STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:31.970
PROGRAMS COMPANIES ARE SAFELY

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:34.005
SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.507
DOLLARS TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.474
FURTHER WHILE THESE DEALS ARE

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:38.743
OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.311
AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:41.412
BENEFITS.

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.014
IN MY VIEW THESE CLAIMS ARE

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:43.815
DUBIOUS.

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.083
SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.451
REQUIRE THAT THE PROMISED JOBS

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.286
OR EVEN CREATED AND EVEN WHEN

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:49.187
THEY DO.

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:51.156
HIS JOBS CAN BE AN AND WAREHOUSE

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.258
FACILITIES WHAT WHERE THE WORK

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:54.792
IS GRUELING LOW WAGE AND LACK

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.261
BENEFITS.

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:58.796
SO THESE CITIES AT THAT DO THESE

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.331
DEALS THEY DO NEED REAL JOB

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:01.666
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.001
FAMILIES BUT WE DON'T NEED A

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:04.669
RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHICH IS THE

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.237
CURRENT SITUATION. FOR THOSE

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.372
REASONS THE MEASURE THAT'S

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:08.940
BEFORE YOU WOULD PROHIBIT ANY

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.608
FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:11.809
AGREEMENTS.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.011
BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.812
PRIVATE COMPANIES IT HAS NO

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.548
EFFECT ON ANY EXISTING.

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.549
AGREEMENTS.

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:20.018
IT TAKES NO MONEY FROM ANY CITY.

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.352
UNDER THIS BILL.

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:23.121
BUT IT IS NOT AT AND IT DOES NOT

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.589
REDUCE THE SALES TAX REVENUE TO

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:25.757
ANY CITY CAN RECEIVE IN THE

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.058
FUTURE.

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:30.028
THEBILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM --

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.596

NINE THE CALL CENTER.

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.925
IS IN OUR ZIP CODE.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.994
AND WE GET ALL THAT SALES TAX.

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.863
EVEN THOUGH THE WAREHOUSES IN

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.032
ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE SO.

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.034
THAT'S A INTERESTING DICHOTOMY

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:33.104
THERE -- MY QUESTION IS WOULD

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.806
THE AUTHOR BE WILLING.

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.141
TO AMEND.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:40.711
THIS TO CITIES.

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:43.013
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.749
POPULATION ARE HIGHER.

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.817
THAT WAY THE YOUNGER SMALLER

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:50.454
CITIES HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPETE.

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:51.822
FOR CALL CENTERS WHERE HOUSES

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:55.192
EXCEPT A BECAUSE THEY NEED TO

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:59.163
WAVE MORE THAN SAN FRANCISCO LA

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.231
OR SAN DIEGO [inaudible]

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:01.599
SO.

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:03.567
THAT'S MY QUESTION.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.169
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PUT A

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.138
LIMIT POPULATION LIMIT.

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:09.473
ON THE BILL.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.975
OF THROUGH THE CHAIR -- WELL

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.309
THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:15.012
QUESTION AND I THINK THAT --

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.647
THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE YOU GET

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.282
ON HERE WHEN YOU START TO PICK

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.417
WINNERS OR LOSERS OR ADVANCED

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:21.652
ONE GROUP AT COMMUNITY VERSUS

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.520
ANOTHER I THINK IF THE

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.255
OVERRIDING STATE GOAL IS

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:25.589
FAIRNESS.

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.825
IN OUR TAX SYSTEM FAIRNESS.

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.360
WHERE EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.762
PLAYFIELD PLAYING FIELD IN WHICH?

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.197
TO DEAL I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.799
WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR HERE AND

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.433
THAT I I RECOGNIZE THAT

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.835
COMMUNITIES.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.370
AND THIS HAPPENS AND LOTS OF

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.237
DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:41.906
I IT COULD BECAUSE YOU HAVE --

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.073
MOUNTAINS ARE YOU HAVE A LAKE OR

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.608
YOUR NEXT TO THE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:46.310
ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT MAKE.

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:48.479
LIFE AND COMMUNITIES LIVE IT IS

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.014
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR OR UNFAIR AND

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.714
SO.

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.616
I THINK THAT WENT ONCE YOU START

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.018
CREATING THESE CARVE OUTS.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.719
LET'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.921
MANIPULATED BY OTHERS.

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.589
OTHER WORDS IT YOU START

00:40:58.656 --> 00:40:59.857
CREATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.425
IT SPECIALIZE WILL THAT'S THE

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.526
THAT'S THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.727
THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.430
TO MANIPULATE THAT -- AND I ALL

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:07.832
I CAN SAY IS IS THAT WELL I AM

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:08.933
VERY SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.334
SITUATION THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.735
YOU COME FROM AS WELL AS THE

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:14.004
OTHERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN TO HER

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:17.241
TODAY -- THIS IS NOT A FOR IT WE

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:18.342
SHOULD USE OUR TAX CODE TO DO

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.010
THAT WHEN IT CAN BE SO

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:22.646
MANIPULATED BY OTHERS -- TO THE

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:24.415
DISADVANTAGE PUBLIC THE PUT THE

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.783
PUBLIC GOOD AND THE PUBLIC GOOD

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.685
IS A FAIR TAX SYSTEM WHERE THE

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.919
IMPACTS.

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.355
OF THOSE -- THAT COME FROM THOSE

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:33.057
ENTERPRISES ARE ARE COVERED IN

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:34.024
SOME FASHION.

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.125
AND SO WHILE YOU TALK ABOUT THE

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:36.894
CALL CENTER GETTING THE REVENUE

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.429
BECAUSE IS DESIGNATED AT THE

00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:39.363
POINT OF SALE.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.798
THAT DISTRIBUTION FACILITY OR

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.333
THAT MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:43.968
HAS ALL THE TRUCK TRAFFIC AND

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.703
MAYBE EVEN THE POLLUTION THEY'RE

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.171
VERY IN ALL THE BIRDS.

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.539
THE MANIPULATION IS THAT YOU

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:49.240
HAVE THE AT THAT CITY YOU

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:50.808
RECOGNIZE GETS THE BENEFIT

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.243
BECAUSE THEY GET THE CALL CENTER

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.310
THEIR DESIGNATING AS POINT OF

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:53.744
SALE.

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:54.678
THAT'S A MANIPULATION OF THE

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.080
COAT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHERE

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.582
IMPACTS HAPPEN AND YES IT DOES --

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.551
IT CAN'T HURT SMALLER

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:01.418
COMMUNITIES BUT YOU COULD ALSO

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.186
ARGUE THAT.

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:02.686
THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:05.656
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE LOWER

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.791
TAX BASE -- THAT HAVE A MORE

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:08.392
RESPONSIVE SAID.

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:10.661
A COMMUNITY LESS REGULATION.

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.762
SO THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS TO TRY.

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:12.730
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.598
CHOICES CITIES CAN AND ENGAGE IN

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.433
THE WAY THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.501
THEM COMPETITIVE BUT HERE'S THE

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:17.735
THING.

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.603
THEY CAN.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.938
CREATE INCENTIVES.

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.306
THEY CAN USE THE BRADLEY BURNS

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:23.741
SALES TAX EVEN UNDER THIS

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:25.609
MEASURE TO CREATE INCENTIVES BUT

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.077
THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY HAVE TO

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:28.312
USE THEIR BRADLEY BIRDS.

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.680
NOT EVERYBODY ELSE'S CITIES

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:31.882
BRADLEY BURNS WHICH IS THE

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.417
MANIPULATION TODAY SO THEY CAN.

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.752
PUT THAT WELCOME THAT OUT IN

00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:38.289
pUSING THE TAX CODE THAT THEY THE

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.990
MONEY THEY GET BUT IT'S THE

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.258
MINUTE ELATION THAT I'M TRYING

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:45.195
TO DO WITH THE IN THE BILL.

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:48.832
RESPECTFULLY WERE LESS COMMON.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.100
ONE LAST COMMENT ON NOW -- AND

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.135
THEN I'LL BE QUIET.

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:51.702
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.137
COMMAND CONTROL [inaudible]

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:55.272
AND SUPPRESSING.

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.774
COMMERCE.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.376
AND FREE ENTERPRISE AND PEOPLE

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.613
THAT ARE WILLING. TO ACCEPT LESS

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.149
TAXES FROM AN ENTITY IN ORDER TO

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:07.551
GET.

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:10.654
AN INCREMENT OF THE TAXES.

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.357
SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:14.925
IF I'M IN A SMALL CITY THAT'S

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.327
WILLING TO GIVE UP HALF THE

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:20.130
SALES TAX. TO GET THAT ENTITY.

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:23.400
WELL THEN WHERE EVER THEY WERE

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.402
TO BEGIN WITH HAD BETTER CUT A

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.837
DEAL TO THAT'S CALLED

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.872
COMPETITION THAT HELPS KEEP

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:32.476
PRICES LOW THAT HELPS THE JOBS.

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.378
IT IS CALLED FREE ENTERPRISE WHO

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.880
CAN MAKE THE BEST DEAL.

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.749
THAT'S NOT COMMAND CONTROL

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:41.251
SOCIALISTIC TYPE OF BUSINESS

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:44.088
VENEZUELA HAS COMMAND CONTROL.

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:47.725
I LIKE TO SEE HEALTHY

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:50.227
COMPETITION I'M DONE.

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:52.629
YES -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNER

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:57.701
HARLOT -- THINGS THAT ARE --

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.938
ACTUALLY MI SIX GREAT BUT IT

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:02.773
LIKE THAT [inaudible]

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.112
SO -- SORRY -- SO I DID MY SIX

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.114
GRAY FUNDAY BACK AND LIKE PARIS

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.081
BACK IN THE DAY I GREW UP IN THE

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:11.648
INLAND EMPIRE AND THERE ARE

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:11.982
COMMUNITIES.

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:13.117
IN OUR STATE -- THAT DON'T HAVE

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.785
RESOURCES SO COULD YOU ADDRESS

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:15.686
SOME OF THE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:16.320
BY THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.421
COMMITTEES THAT DON'T HAVE

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:20.190
RESOURCES LIKE THE CITY OF PARIS.

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.258
IF THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.593
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO YOU

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:27.364
ENVISION OR DO WE HAVE AVAILABLE --

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:28.499
IF THIS WERE REMOVED.

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:31.468
THROUGH THE CHAIR -- SO AT THIS

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:33.037
MEASURE ONLY STOPS NEW DEALS

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.538
FROM HAPPENING OKAY IT DOESN'T

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.340
CHANGE ANY OF THE EXISTING DEALS

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:37.875
THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR TEN

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:38.942
OR TWENTY YEARS.

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:41.045
SO THE THE PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:42.846
LOSING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.314
FROM THESE FEELS YEARLY.

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:45.382
OKAY ACCORDING TO A FINANCIAL

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.017
ANALYSIS THIS IS SAYS WE

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.819
SHOULDN'T ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.087
TO HAPPEN.

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.355
I IN THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING.

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:55.059
THE THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT --

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.693
SHOULD WE BE USING THIS PART OF

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.162
THE TAX CODE TO TAKE MONEY FROM

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.431
THE 95% OF THE OTHER CITIES TO

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:01.065
HELP.

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.699
THAT THE A WHAT WOULD MAY BE

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.468
VIEWED AS DISADVANTAGED CITIES

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.070
THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION AND

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:08.338
AND FOR ME THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:09.873
THAT THAT THIS PART OF THE TAX

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.175
CODE SHOULD NOT WE SHOULD NOT

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:11.942
ALLOW IT TO BE MANIPULATED

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.577
BECAUSE WHILE YOU MAY FEEL IT'S

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:14.812
HELPING THIS ONE DISADVANTAGED

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:15.579
CITY.

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.614
IT'S ONLY TAKING MONEY FROM 95%

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.849
OF THE OTHER CITIES.

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.651
IT'S ALLOWING THAT CORPORATION

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:22.419
TO GET THE MONEY BACK TO THEM IN

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:23.720
SOME CASES THESE DEALS GET A

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:26.290
100% OF THAT TAX RATE COMMENT

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:27.224
BACK TO THE COMPANY.

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:28.025
AND THEY SAY WE'RE DOING THAT

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.460
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING THE JOBS

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:33.097
THESE -- THESE THAT THESE GREAT

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:35.199
WAREHOUSE JOBS -- SO LOOK I I

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.633
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE THERE

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.701
ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE TAKEN

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.603
ADVANTAGE OF IT AND WILL NOT BE

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.071
ABLE TO DO THAT UNDER UNDER THIS

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:43.107
BILL IF IT WERE TO BECOME LAW

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:43.807
BUT WE'RE NOT ON WINDING ANY

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:44.875
DEALS.

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:45.609

FIRE.

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.377
LIKELY AREAS AND MANY OF OUR

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:10.647

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:14.817

THE AREA.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.925

PEOPLE OUT.

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.928

REPRESENTED FOR A LONG TIME

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.303
PARADISE.

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:34.938
BUT MOST OF THE HISTORY ONLY HAD

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:36.406
ONE WROTE.

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.107
COMING DOWN THAT RIDGE.

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:39.242
OUT.

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.476
THE SECONDARY ROADS THEN FINALLY

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.378
WAS.

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:46.015
EFFECTED BUT THERE WAS DEFICIENT.

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.250
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM.

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:49.786
WHEN THAT FIRE HIT?

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.287
YEAR AND A HALF PRIOR.

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.755
WHEN THE ORAL DAM SPILLWAY

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.125
NOT WITHSTANDING.

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:59.562
BROUGHT MORE ROADS AVAILABILITY.

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:02.532
EVACUATING THE HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:03.032
EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.534
THROUGH THREE COUNTIES.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.603
WAS QUITE A PROBLEM.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.673
SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES IS

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:10.974
[inaudible]

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.711
CREATE.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.213
AN ALTERNATIVE THAT FOR THESE

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.682
AFFECTED AREAS.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:22.118
THERE MUST BE TO EVACUATION

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:22.418
[inaudible]

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:23.853
WROTE [inaudible]

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.154
SECURED [inaudible]

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.956
AVAILABLE.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:29.425
AND COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLIC.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.327
SO THEY KNOW [inaudible]

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.261
WHERE THIS [inaudible]

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:36.265
WILL BE.

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.967
AND THAT THEY CAN BE IN AN

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.302
ORDERLY MANNER.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.204
MANY COUNTIES SINCE THESE

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.273
DISASTERS HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.776
EVACUATION PLANTS.

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:47.877
THE CENTERS WHERE THEY WILL

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.346
ACCUMULATE PEOPLE AND SORT OUT.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.749
CARS AND TRAFFIC.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.617
BUT WE STILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE GOT

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.352
TO HAVE.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.221
THE EXIT ROUTES.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.256
AND THIS WILL SET FORTH.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:04.861
A PLAN FOR THAT [inaudible] ONE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:08.131
VERY PERSONAL EXAMPLE OF THIS.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.565
THE FELLOW WHO IS A FRIEND OF

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:11.901
MINE AND USED TO WORK FOR ME WAS

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.338
THE CEO OF BUTTE COUNTY FOR MANY

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.774
YEARS LIVED UP IN THE GAME.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.108
AND I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIM.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.544
HIS WIFE WAS EVACUATED HE WAS

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.579
DOWN IN THE VALLEY AND SHE WAS

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:24.514
AT THEIR HOME.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.249
TRYING TO GET OUT.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.683
SHE WAS USING.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.119
THE SKY WAY WHICH IS THE MAIN

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.687
ROUTE AND SHE SAID OH MY GOD

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:36.726
THERE'S FIRE. TO MY RIGHT.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.528
COMING RIGHT UP THE ROAD NOW

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:40.329
THERE IS THE SECOND EXIT ROUTE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.098
THAT HAS JUST BEEN RE ESTABLISH

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.766
A FEW YEARS AGO.

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.935
HE SAID TURN AROUND HONEY AND GO

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.970
THE OTHER WAY.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.038
WHICH SHE DID.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.073
SHE HAD NO MORE THAN TURNED

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.507
AROUND AND SHE SAID WELL I GOT

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:52.875
THE FIRES ON BOTH SIDES OF ME

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.044
NOW.

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.679
WELL SHE AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.315
GOT OUT.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.017
BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.118
SECONDARY ROUTE NOT BEEN

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.253
AVAILABLE.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.421
NOR HAD THE SKY WAY BEEN

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.290
IMPROVED.

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.659
SO THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD ACTION.

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.194
AND THAT VERY CONGESTED AREA

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.562
AGAIN THESE ARE.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:15.598

CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.637
WE MUST BE READY AND THIS

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:24.240
LEGISLATION GIVES.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.708
AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:28.077
