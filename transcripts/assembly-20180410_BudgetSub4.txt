QUORUM CIVIL STARS A COMMITTEE TO RESTORE OFF ON ISSUENUMBER FOUR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CALIFORNIA PIECE TAX CREDIT FOR HIM EXTENSION TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE FORGET WE START WITH YOU FIRST. YOUR WORKS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL COOK FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH ISSUE DID YOU WANT TO START WITH TODAY. FOUR FOUR FORTY BEATS GREAT. OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIR COOPER COMMIT MEMBERS OUR MONEY WAS WELL COOKED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY PERCENT ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT. TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT THE PROGRAM WAS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE TWENTY THIRTEEN. IN WHICH THE OLD ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM WAS REPLACED WITH THREE NEW TOOLS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ONE OF WHICH BEING A PARTIAL SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR MANUFACTURING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE SECOND BEING A GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED HIRING CREDIT AND THE THIRD BEING THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT. WHICH WAS CREATED TO BE A TOOL FOR. A TO HELP ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO LOCATE OR EXPAND IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE AUTHORIZATION TO AWARD CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDITS. ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING. EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT FOR FIVE FISCAL YEARS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. PROVIDE TAX CUT ALLOCATION FORTY OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION PER FISCAL YEAR. PROVIDE ROUGHLY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN BUDGET AUTHORITY EACH YEAR TO SUPPORT OUR EXISTING TEN POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. AND MAKES STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON JAY CHAIRMAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK. WE WE THINK IT TAKES WHAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN MAKES A MAKE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES. VOWED TO. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR. FOR GOBIZ TO. ALLOCATE CREDITS THAT ARE. BETTER MEETING THE GOALS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM. MEN AND WE'VE WE'VE NARROWED THE GOALS. IN THIS IN STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO A TO GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL FORTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CREDITS ARE. I'M GOING TO BUSINESSES THAT ARE ON. WHERE THE CREDIT IS ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND? IN THE. WHERE THE JOBS ARE LOCATED? LL. BRAIN WITH THE FORD WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN FEBRUARY POSTS ARE FULL COMMENTS ON THE MINISTRATIONS CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROPOSAL SO QUICKLY SUMMARIZE THEM. SOME WE RECOMMENDED A REJECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PREFERENTIAL TAX CREDITS TO HAVE BEEN AWARDED TO WHAT WE CALL. NON TRIBBLE BUSINESSES OF THOSE ARE BUSINESSES THAT INHERENTLY SO GOODS AND SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN A LOCAL AREA AND SO THEY'RE NOT. THE COMPETING ONLY WITH OTHER CALIFORNIA BUSINESS NOT NECESSARILY. NATIONALLY INTERNATIONALLY AND. SOME. SMALL ACCOUNTING BUSINESSES DOCTORS AND A WHOLE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS SUCH AS PLUMBERS AND GARAGE DOOR INSTALLERS. FURTHER A WE THINK THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PROBABLY AMONG THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKELY HARM TO BUY A WORD SCUFF REPEATS WORDS TO COMPETING ON TRADE WILL BUSINESSES. WE DIFFERENTIATE THESE FROM TRADABLE BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES OR MAKE GOODS THAT THEY SELL CLIENTS CUSTOMERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THOSE INCLUDE MANUFACTURER SOFTWARE COMPANIES DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES THAT SERVE MULTIPLE STATE SO. IN OUR QUICK. IT WELL IN OUR. ANALYSIS OF THE. THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE WORDS HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGH NOVEMBER ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT SO MOST OF THEM WERE MADE TO TRADE WILL BUSINESSES. THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED ROOMIE TO NON TRADABLE BUSINESSES AND SO IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO EXTEND CALIFORNIA COMPETES WE THINK WE MADE MORE EFFECTIVE IF YOU ADD LANGUAGE THAT CLEARLY EXPRESSES THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS THAT SOUTHERN GOODS AND SERVICES REGIONALLY NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE NOT JUST TO. CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AT THE SAME TIME RECOMMEND DELETING THOSE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE LAW THE DESTRUCTIVE IS TO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY TIED TO THE CENTER. ALSO IF THERE'S OTHER POLICY GOALS THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO LEGISLATURE. ON ANOTHER PROGRAM. IN A NOT WE KNOW HOW TO WIN IN MIND HELP INCREASE MAY NOT BE THE BEST PROGRAM. TO TO ACHIEVE OTHER POLICY GOALS NECESSARILY. SO ON. COME RIGHT NOW THE STATE'S TRYING TO PICK AND CHOOSE FROM AMONG VARIOUS BUSINESSES THAT ARE WHERE THE PROGRAM IN APPLY TO IT. AND AND IT'S. CREATING DISCREPANCIES AN UNFAIR TAX TREATMENT BETWEEN DIFFERENT BUSINESSES WITHIN THE STATE. AND SO. DID WANT TO COMMENT THAT. WERE FOUND LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF THE MINISTRATIONS TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES BUT WE DO SUPPORT. ELIMINATING THE SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE BECAUSE THE LOT OF THOSE CREDITS WHEN ACTUALLY BEING USED BY SMALL BUSINESSES. AND. SOMETHING THAT MORE DIRECTLY AFFECTS A MUCH LARGER NUMBER SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD BE THAT. IF ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. THE ONLY ONE HERE. AYE SYRIA TO MEMBERS. THE ON SITE.

I DO WANT TO. MAKE ONE COMMENT THAT WE WE ARE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY ON IN THIS ALLOCATION AYE AND ONE OF A RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE AYE IS ON A KIND OF PROBE. OF KIND OF PROGRAMMING AND HOW THIS WOULD BE ALLOCATED IS THAT. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE AYE IN THE BCP. WE THINK THAT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT TO A LIMITED AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT TOO NARROW.

THE INLAND EMPIRE IS TRULY AN ECONOMIC FORCE AS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING REGIONS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES.

AYE MANY OF OUR ENTREPRENEURS PUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL INTO THE SUCCESS OF THEIR SMALL BUSINESS OFTENTIMES MISSING A CRITICAL FAMILY MOMENTS SUCH AS MAY BE MISSING SOCCER GAMES ARE FAMILY TIME AROUND THE DINNER TABLE.

MAKING HISTORIC INVESTMENT. MARY SELECIONE I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE LARK TO INSTITUTE AND I HAVE A QUESTION SLASH OF REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATION ON INTENT. IN THOUGH CRITERION FOR APPLICATIONS THAT ARE APPLYING FOR THE PROGRAM IT STATES THAT AN APPLICANT MUST HAVE DRAWN DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE LARA INSTITUTE I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. A SIGN OF MANY DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IS THE SIGN OF A A HOPE THE PROGRAM AND CONTINUOUS SERVICE THAT SOMEBODY LIKE CLARK HAD INSTITUTE HAS PROVIDED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO DRAW DOWN ALL OF OUR FEDERAL FUNDING THEN WE WOULD BE SOLELY DEPENDENT ON THIS PROGRAM FOR FINANCIAL BACKING. SO I WOULD REQUIRE AYE AYE LIKES SEEK A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATON ON THAT PIECE AND SEE IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER. A CHANGE NOT COMPONENT BUT OTHERWISE WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL. SURE NATIONALLY THE LANGUAGE HAS CURLY STATES IS THAT YOU CAN BRIAN ACTION PLANNED INDICATES HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIVERSIFY YOUR FUNDING SO YOU CAN BE NEAR YOU KNOW FULLY FUNDED BUT STILL ALLOW US WORD KIND CONSIDERATION FOR THIS KIND ASPECTS. BUT IF WE NEED TO LOOK AT MORE ABOUT HOW THE FEDERAL PROGRAM YOU HAVE OPERATES AND WHAT THE MATTER CRIMES ARE BUT MILLION WORKERS THAT WORK IN THESE MANUFACTURING.

YES. OKAY GO NEXT WEEK UP THE VOTE ONLY STILL ITEMS TWO THREE FIVE TWO THROUGH FIVE. I'LL SECOND THAT. REPUBLIC COOPER AYE BRO. CABALLERO. CHIU CHOI. IF IF YOU. SO NOTICES BECAUSE IVAN PUBLIC. THE COMMISSION DOES NOT OPEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU. OR GO BACK TO. IS NUMBER THREE. YEAH ITC GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALYSSA ANDERSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AT THE KEY POINT I WANT TO MAKE IN MY REMARKS TODAY IS THAT CREATING THE KELLY A T. C.. WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVANCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC OFFERS THE CONSULTANT FEW OF THE. FOLKS OUTSIDE CLAYTON PLEASE. RECEIVE. I. CREATING THE KELLY TO SEE WAS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC SECURITY IN OUR STATE. EACH YEAR SINCE THE TAX CREDIT WAS CREATED IT'S HELPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO EARN VERY LITTLE FROM THEIR JOBS TO BETTER AFFORD BASIC NECESSITIES. AND THANKS TO YOU LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION OF THE CREDIT MANY MORE FAMILIES CAN NOW HAVE AN EASIER TIME MAKING ENDS MEET. SO I WANTED TO START OFF BY HIGHLIGHTING EXACTLY WHO'S BENEFITED FROM THE CREDIT AND HOW MUCH THEY BENEFITED. SO FIRST OF ALL FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR THE COUNTY EIGHTY SI HAVE TO BE WORKING. BUT THE MAJORITY LIVE WELL BELOW THE POVERTY LINE SO THAT MEANS THE ADDITIONAL INCOME THAT THEY GET FROM THIS CREDIT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. OUR LAST YEAR FAMILIES WITH MULTIPLE CHILDREN GOT AN AVERAGE CALLIE ATC OF JUST OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT'S A LOT OF MONEY OF COURSE FOR A FAMILY THAT'S LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. I THIS ADDITIONAL CACHES HELP FAMILIES TO PAY THEIR BILLS PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY DOWN DEBT. AND EVEN IN SOME CASES PAY FOR EMERGENCY EXPENSES LIKE FIXING THEIR CAR. BECAUSE OUR STATE EITC BUILDS ON THE FEDERAL EITC AND THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT. THESE THREE CREDITS COMBINED CAN NEARLY DOUBLE THE INCOME OF A FAMILY WITH THREE OR MORE CHILDREN. AND YOU CAN SEE THIS FROM THE FIRST CHART AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE ONE OF MY HANDOUT. THESE FAMILIES CONCEALER INCOMES RISE BY AS MUCH AS NINETY TWO PERCENT THANKS TO THESE THREE CREDITS. FAMILIES WITH FEWER CHILDREN CAN ALSO SEE THEIR INCOMES RISE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTHOUGH BY A SOMEWHAT SMALLER PERCENTAGE AND THAT'S BECAUSE SMALLER FAMILIES QUALIFY FOR SMALLER CREDITS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE KELLY ATC HAS OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITTED CHILDREN AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART AT THE TOP OF PAGE TWO OF MY HAND OUT. MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF KELLY A TO SEE DOLLARS WENT TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE RESEARCH FINDS THAT BOOSTING FAMILIES INCOMES CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL LONG TERM EFFECTS OF GROWING UP IN POVERTY. THE COUNTY TO SEE ALSO LARGELY BENEFITS WORKING MOTHERS AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO. WOMEN MAKE UP SEVENTY PERCENT OF TAX FILERS WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COUNTY EIGHTY SEE. SO THIS CREDIT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR WORKING MOTHERS WHO TEND TO EARN LESS THAN MEN AND WHO ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SUPPORTING CHILDREN ON THEIR OWN. AND FINALLY THE TABLES ON PAGE THREE OF MY HAND OUT SHOW THOUGH THE CLAIMS DATA FOR THE KELLY A T. C. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. AND THE FIGURES HIGHLIGHTED IN RED SO THAT AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND TAX FILERS BENEFITTED FROM THE COUNTY TO SEE. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND ACTUALLY MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE CREDIT BECAUSE THE TAX FILER CAN BE A MARRIED COUPLE OR CAN BE A PARENT WITH CHILDREN IT'S BASICALLY EVERYONE LISTED ON THE TAX FOR. I THIS YEAR THE KELLY ATC HAS REACHED FAR MORE TAX FILERS ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AS OF MARK MID MARCH OF THIS YEAR ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE END OF TAX FILING SEASON. I AND THAT'S BECAUSE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET EXTENDED THE CREDIT TO MANY. MANY MORE PEOPLE OF. THIS MEANS THE DATA ARE ACTUALLY NOT COMPARABLE FOR THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE SO FAR TO THE PRIOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE CREDIT. AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING A LOWER AVERAGE CREDIT SO FAR THIS YEAR AND THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE BECAME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT THIS YEAR TEND TO QUALIFY FOR SMALLER CREDITS. I SO SPECIFICALLY LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION OF THE KELLY ATC EXTENDED THE CREDIT TO SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS AND THIS HELPED TO BRING OUR STATE CREDIT INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE FEDERAL CREDIT WHICH HAS ALWAYS PERMITTED SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS TO QUALIFY. AND THAT SO FAR THIS YEAR BE WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CLAIMS FROM THE SELF EMPLOYED. AT LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION ALSO EXTENDED THE COUNTY EIGHTY SEE TO WORKERS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER UP THE INCOME SCALE. SO PREVIOUSLY PARENTS HAD EARNED LESS THAN ABOUT AYE TEN THOUSAND TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT. NOW THEY CAN EARN UP TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS PARENTS WORKING FULL TIME OR CLOSE TO FULL TIME AT THE MINIMUM WAGE CAN NOW BENEFIT FROM THE CREDIT. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB ISN'T ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A FAMILY. I FOR WORKERS WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTING CHILDREN THE INCOME NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR THE KELLY EIGHTY SEE MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM JUST UNDER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I THINK THERE'S A STRONG CASE FOR CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN MCCALLIE ITC. OUR FIRST OF ALL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDITS ARE PROVEN POLICIES THE FEDERAL EITC HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SEVERAL DECADES AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS CROWD IT DOESN'T JUST HELP FAMILIES GET BY DAY TODAY. IT'S ALSO BEEN LINKED TO IMPROVED HEALTH FOR MOTHERS AND BABIES AS WELL AS HIGHER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND COLLEGE COMPLETION RATES FOR CHILDREN. SO IT APPEARS THAT THOSE CREDIT CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT LAST INTO THE NEXT GENERATION. I AND OF INCLUDED A SUMMARY OF THIS RESEARCH AT THE BACK OF MY HAND OUT FOR YOUR REFERENCE. I ALSO I THINK THAT WE NEED POLICIES LIKE A STRONG STEVIE ITC BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T COUNT ON THEIR JOBS TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SECURITY. OF FOR EXAMPLE WAGES HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE RISING COST OF LIVING IN PARTICULARLY HIGH HOUSING COSTS. SO EVEN WHEN OUR MINIMUM WAGE IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MANY FAMILIES TO GET BY. I ON TOP OF THAT MANY PEOPLE CAN'T FIND STABLE FULL TIME JOBS SO THEY HAVE TO PATCH TOGETHER TEMPORARY JOBS OR CONTRACT WORK. OR THEY HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH PART TIME HOURS ARE INCONSISTENT HOURS. SO THAT MEANS THEIR EARNINGS ARE JUST IN SUFFICIENT OTHER UNPREDICTABLE AND THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR THEM TO STAY ON TOP THEIR BILLS AND PUT ASIDE ANY SAVINGS FOR THE FUTURE. SO I THINK STRENGTHENING THE COUNTY EIGHTY SEEWOULD FURTHER INCREASE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THESE FAMILIES. SO I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY HIGHLIGHTING A FEW WAYS YOU COULD CONSIDER TO FURTHER INVEST IN THIS CREDIT. ONE OPTION IS TO ALLOW LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM THE CREDIT TO QUALIFY. FOR EXAMPLE MANY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO WORK AND PAY TAXES DON'T BENEFIT FROM THE CREDIT CURRENTLY. YOUNG ADULTS UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE WHO AREN'T SUPPORTING CHILDREN BUT WHO OFTEN DO EARN LOW WAGES DON'T QUALIFY. AND WORKERS OVER AGE SIXTY FULLER DON'T QUALIFY FOR NOT SUPPORTING CHILDREN EVEN THOUGH SOME WORKERS ARE WORKING BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL RETIREMENT AGE OUT OF FINANCIAL NECESSITY. ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD STRENGTHEN THE KELLY EIGHTY SEE IS BY MAKING SURE THAT FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS DON'T LOSE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CREDIT AS A MINIMUM WAGE RISES. AND THAT WOULD SIMPLY. REQUIRE RAISING THE INCOME LIMIT TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT FROM TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WHERE IT IS CURRENTLY TO ABOUT THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BY A TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. I AND FINALLY YOU COULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE CROWD IT PARTICULARLY FOR THE LOWEST EARNING WORKERS OR FOR WORKERS WHO CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR RELATIVELY SMALL CREDITS. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS YOU COULD CONSIDER TO FURTHER BUILD ON THE KELLY ITC. AND THAT WOULD HELP A ADDITIONAL LOW INCOME FAMILIES BETTER MAKE ENDS MEET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE STILL PREVENTS HE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA I WON I THINK. BUDGET CHAIR TING IN THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON KELLY ABC OVER THE. PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BECAUSE OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE EITC MORE THAN A MILLION FAMILY AT LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET TO PAY FOR BASIC NEEDS. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. A I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CAL YANKEE SEE ADVOCACY COALITION. WHICH IS A COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY ORGANIZATIONS. REPRESENTING ADVOCATES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IMMIGRANTS CHILDREN USE SENIORS FOOD BANKS PEDIATRICIANS SOCIAL WORKERS ON ALL COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AND ARE COMMITTED. TO THE CALIFORNIA E. I. T. C.. WE KNOW THAT IT'S A PROVEN WAY TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. ONE THAT REDUCES POVERTY. IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH AND WELL BEING CHILD UP EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SPURS LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BUILD FINANCIAL SECURITY IN THE LONG RUN ALL OF THE GREAT RESEARCH. THAT ALYSSA JUST MENTIONED. THAT'S WHY ARE COALITION IS URGING THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO TAKE ACTION THIS YEAR TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE CALLIOPE DC. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PROPOSALS TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THE SIZE OF THE CREDIT. TO IMPROVE THE POVERTY FIGHTING IMPACT OF THE CALLIOPE DC. A WE ALSO STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER. EXTENDING ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CALLEA EIGHTY SEE TO SEVERAL POPULATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE YEAH I THI SIS. LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING AND FILING TAXES BUT ARE ABLE TO CLAIM THIS REALLY IMPORTANT CREDIT. SPECIFICALLY LOW INCOME WORKING YOUNG ADULTS WORKING SENIORS AND IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. I'VE CALIFORNIA IS NOT BOUND BY FEDERAL EITC ELIGIBILITY RULES AND WE CAN MAKE OUR CALIPARI ID SEE MORE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE. AND A TIME WHEN FEDERAL TAX AND SOCIAL POLICY IS ARE BECOMING MORE REPRESSIVE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. SO WE URGE YOU. TO EXTEND CALLEA T. C. ELIGIBILITY TO THREE GROUPS. FIRST OF LOW INCOME WORKING YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR NOT CURRENTLY THOSE YOUNG ADULTS ARE ARE EXCLUDED. IF THEY ARE TO SUPPORTING CHILDREN FROM THE CALLI IDC. NOT AGE LIMIT REALLY LEAVES OUT YOUNG ADULTS WHO LACK FINANCIAL STABILITY EARLY IN THEIR CAREERS WORKING STUDENTS WERE STRUGGLING TO GET BY AND FORMER FOSTER YOU. THIS AGE GROUP EXPERIENCES POVERTY AT A HIGHER RATE THAN ANY OTHER ADULT PIC. ADULT AGE GROUP. CURRENTLY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE WOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THEY EVEN BE ARE ARE EVEN ABLE TO CLAIM THE EITC. SO MAKING THIS CREDIT AVAILABLE TO LOW WAGE YOUNG ADULTS WILL PROVIDE KEY SUPPORT DURING A VITAL PERIOD OF THEIR CAREER DEVELOPMENT. SECOND LOW INCOME WORKING. SENIORS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE. WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE CALLIOPE C.? I AT A TIME WHEN OLDER ADULTS ARE BEING FORCED TO WORK OUT OF. OUT OF. FINANCIAL NECESSITY AFTER TRADITIONAL RETIREMENT AGE THIS AGE LIMIT IS PREVENTING POOR STUDENTS ARE POOR SENIORS FROM BENEFITING FROM THE CREDIT. MAXIMUM SO SECURITY BENEFITS AREN'T AVAILABLE UNTIL AGE AGE SEVENTY AND MANY LOW INCOME WORKERS DON'T RECEIVE ENOUGH SO SECURITY TO LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY. AND FINALLY A IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND FAMILIES WITH INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE AYE TENS OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. MANY IMMIGRANT WORKING FAMILIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALLEA TO SEE BECAUSE THE CREDIT IS ONLY GRANTED WHEN EVERY CLAIMED PERSON THE HOUSEHOLD HASN'T SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BALLOT FOR WORK. MANY IMMIGRANTS FILE WITH THE FEDERALLY ASSIGNED TAX VERY IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR AND I TEN. I'M TO PAY FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES AND FILE ON THEIR TAX RETURNS YET ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COUNTY IDC. I INCLUDING THESE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WOULD HELP REDUCE THE HARM OF RECENT FEDERAL ACTIONS LIKE PROVISION IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TAX FEDERAL TAX BILL THAT DENIED THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. OF TWO OF MY ROUGHLY ONE MILLION CHILDREN WHO HAVE. BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. AND IT WOULD ALSO PROTECT ELIGIBILITY FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY LOSE IMMIGRATION RELIEF LIKE DHAKA AND TPS. REMOVING THIS EXCLUSION TO THE CALLEA T. C. WOULD PROVIDE GREATER FINANCIAL SECURITY TO LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. WHO PAY TAXES AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY? AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN POVERTY. THAT'S DD IDC REALLY OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY A APPROVING OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE POVERTY AND HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE. AND WE URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO STRIKE THAT I THINK YOU COULD YOU. I'M BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I PREPARED A HAND OUT. THAT I DESCRIBED THE STATE'S. AND INCOME TAX CREDIT. EDUCATION OUTREACH ACTIVITIES I THINK ON MOST YOU HAVE A COPY OF IT THAT ON THIS ARE SOME OUTSIDE. BUT THE FIRST TWO PAGES ARE MOSTLY BACKGROUND ON THE CREDIT BUT I WANTED TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE LAST BULLET POINT ON PAGE TWO. MOST OF THE ELIGIBLE FILERS DID NOT CLEAN THE STATE EITC LAST YEAR AND OF COURSE THIS YEAR A LOT OF THAT'S DUE TO THE EXPANSION BUT. A SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE FIVE THERE'S A FILING STATE TAX RETURN FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING THIS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ONGOING SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION OUR CHECK TO THE CASE. I'M TURNING TO PAGE THREE. THE STE DATES EXISTING. HAS A NUMBER OF. EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR EDUCATION SIT TAX PERSISTENCE CANADA EDUCATION OUTREACH FOR THE YEAH TEA SEE. THEM UNIMPORTANT. PROGRAM IS THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE'S INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT FREE AND. OF FIVE FILING FOR FEDERAL AND STATE TAX PREPARATION THIS IS. THE VITA PROGRAM AND REALIZE ON ON THE ASSISTANCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING NON PROFITS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. IN ADDITION THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS RECEIVED A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY SINCE THE. BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEENBUDGET FOR EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EDUCATION OUTREACH TONIGHT DESCRIBE THOSE INITIATIVES ON PAGE FOUR. BUT I I WANT TO MOVE ON IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO PAGE FIVE BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS ALSO RECEIVED ON TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON EACH OF THOSE YEARS AND ONE TIME FUNDS. TO MAKE GRANTS. TO. TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FOR ARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. SEE ARM. ADD THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT ARE CST TWO ADMINISTER THE GRANT APPLICATION EVALUATION PROCESS. SO THE APPLICATIONS ARM REQUIRED APPLICANTS TO PROVIDE DETAILED NARRATIVES DESCRIBING THE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN REACHING. LOW INCOME POPULATIONS THAT MIGHT FACE CULTURALLY SPECIFIC AND LINGUISTICALLY SPECIFIC ON. CONSIDERATIONS AND. BARRIERS TO MAYBE LEARNING ABOUT HER. THE THE E. I. T. C. IN FILING THEIR STATE TAXES. IN ADDITION. IT REQUIRES NARRATIVES ON WHAT THEIR EXISTING IT YOU SEE EDUCATION OUTREACH OPERATIVE M. ACTIVITIES WHERE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE FUNDS TO EXPAND THIS ACTIVITIES. AND. TWENTY SIXTEEN CST MADE ELEVEN. GRANTS TO ELEVEN ORGANIZATIONS AND ON TO TEN ORGANIZATIONS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S A MAP SHOWING. OF THE VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE STATE. AND THE GROUPS THAT RECEIVE THOSE GRANTS AND ON PAGE SIX. AND A SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE GRANTEES ARE ENGAGED IN THESE INCLUDE I'M PROVIDING FREE. TAX PREPARATION ASSISTANCE. PRESENT EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION TO INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THROUGH A WIDE RANGE OF. SCALES FROM DOOR TO DOOR CANVASSING TO LARGE GROUPS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. AND ADDITION TO OTHER TYPES OF OF ADVERTISING FROM LOCAL NEWS MEDIA TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND. RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS AND SO FORTH. ANOTHER REQUIREMENT OF THESE GRANTS IS THAT THE. I'M TURNING OUT TO PAGE SEVEN IS THAT THE GRANTEES ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND REPORT MONTHLY ON STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THEY REACH FROM EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY ENGAGE IN. AND MANY OF THESE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARM ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON RAISING AWARENESS OF THE STATE EITC AND. THIS IS CRITICAL ALSO THE VITA CENTERS. SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THESE PROGRAMS AND. E. I. T. C.. CLAIMS. JUST BASED ON THESE MEASURES BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO KNOW. IS RAISING AWARENESS LEADING TO MORE CLAIMS WHEN PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT THE PROGRAM ARE THEY AND THEN GOING HOME WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. A PAID TAX PREPARER AND SO. ONE OF THEM MOPE WITH ANYTHING ONE OF THE MORE EFFECTIVE. ACTIVITIES IS THE FREE TAX PREPARATION AND IT'S CERTAINLY EASIEST TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT ACTIVITY. NOT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF RAISING AWARENESS IT'S JUST IN TERMS OF DETERMINING EFFECTIVENESS IT'S IT'S HARDER TO UNDERSTAND. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ON THOSE ACTIVITIES. BUT WITH THAT IN MIND AND GIVEN THAT MANY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A STATE INCOME TAX RETURN WE DO ON THINK THAT FUTURE OUTREACH EFFORTS MAY WANT TO CONCENTRATE. ON PROVIDING A MORE FREE TAX PREPARATION SITES AND MAKING SURE THE SITES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO THE NOON SUN TURNED AWAY. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JUDY DARNELL VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR UNITED WAYS THE CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR'S SUPPORTING THE EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY TO THE HARD WORKING SELF EMPLOYED FOLKS AND TO THE. IN GROUP INCREASING NAY. INCOME LIMIT HOWEVER UNTIL ALL HARD WORKING LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS AREAS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO GET BY HAVE ACCESS TO KELLY ATC. WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. OUR GOAL IS TO GET AS MUCH OF THE AREA TO SEE INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKING HOUSEHOLDS AS POSSIBLE. BY INCREASING AND IMPROVING THE OUTREACH TARGETED TO LOOK. ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS AND IN BOTH HIGH DENSITY AND RURAL STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND BY EXPANDING IN PROMOTING THE AVAILABILITY OF FREE TAX PREP SERVICES. FULFILL THIS PROMISE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING AREAS. THEIR FIRST IS THE NEED FOR THE EXPANDED OUTREACH WHILE ELIGIBILITY FOR CALLIE IDC WITH EX TENDED TO THE ADDITIONAL ONE POINT ONE MILLION WORKERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE FUNDING FOR OUTREACH REMAIN THE SAME. YET IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EITC HAD HEARD OF THE CREDIT AND FEWER THAN HALF OF THOSE HAD FILE THEIR TAXES. ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE. BUDGET POLICY CENTER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ELIGIBLE WORKERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE THEIR TAXES BECAUSE THEIR INCOME IS SO LOW AND BECAUSE OF THE RECENT FEDERAL TAX LAW. EVEN FEWER FAMILIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO FILE THEIR FEDERAL RETURNS IN THE FUTURE. THE LAST TWO YEARS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED THE OUTREACH GRANTS TO REACH MANY POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE WORKERS BUT FOCUSED IN ON THAT TEN COUNTIES DESPITE. DAHLE IT SEE ELIGIBLE FOLKS LIVING EVERYWHERE. WE KNOW OUTREACH PROVIDES A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT. ACCORDING TO THE UC IRVINE RESEARCH CALLIE IDC OUTREACH DRAWS DOWN UNTAPPED FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR LOW INCOME AREAS BY INCREASING THE FEDERAL EITC UPTAKE. AND BOOSTING THE STATE ECONOMY. WITHOUT REACH PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER FILE THEIR TAX RETURNS DO SO. SECOND IS THE NEED FOR. MORE FREE TAX PREP. BY INVESTING AN ADDITIONAL FREE TAX PREP SERVICES MORE ELIGIBLE WORKERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP ALL OF THEIR CREDIT LEVERAGING THE POLICY ARE POVERTY FIGHTING IMPACT OF THE EITC. WHILE THERE IS A FREE ONLINE FILING SUCH AS MY FREE TAXES DOT ORG MANY PEOPLE NEED AND WANT. THE ASSISTANCE OF A TRAINED CERTIFIED VOLUNTEER TO ASSIST THEM. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND CLIENTS AT THE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY VITA SITES SERVE LAST YEAR. AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND AS OF MARCH NINETEENTH THIS YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL IRS REPORT COVERING TWO THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALSO THE ERROR RATE AT BY THE SITES IS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT THEIR COMMERCIAL. PREPARES OUR. UNFORTUNATELY APPOINTMENTS OF BY THE SITES ARE SOMETIMES FILLED FOUR TO SIX WEEKS OUT WERE UNAVAILABLE. IN ADDITION. IN AN ANALYSIS OF ZIP CODES IN COUNTIES ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST ESTIMATED NUMBER A POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS. DO NOT HAVE ANY FREE TAX PREP SITES. SITES ARE VERY SCARCE IN RURAL AREAS REPORTS FROM THE FIELD SHOW THAT SOME RURAL CLIENTS HAVE TO TRAVEL OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF. TO REACH A FREE TAX PREP SITE. BUT EVEN IN LA. CLIENT NOW HAMBRE HAD TO DRIVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES SOUTH DUTY RESTRICTIONS BY SOME OF THE CURRENT FUNDERS THAT DID NOT ALLOW HER TO BE SERVED CLOSE TO HER HOME. CALLIE ICC HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS HELPING TO FIGHT POVERTY BUT TO CARRY OUT THAT PROMISE OF KELLY I TO SEE. WE HAVE ASKED THAT WE BE EQUALLY COMMITTED TO REACHING OUT TO POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE WORKERS AND THEN MAXIMIZING THEIR CREDIT BY PROVIDING MORE FREE TAX PREPOSITIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

WE HAVE NOW FORTY SITES AND WE EXPECT TO ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FILINGS THIS YEAR. BUT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GROWN SO MUCH IN THESE RECENT YEARS OUR SITES ARE VERY BUSY AND OUR APPOINTMENTS ARE ALWAYS FULL AND WE DO END UP HAVING TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IN YOUR. DISTRICT CHAIRMAN COOPER WE HAVE A THREE SITES IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS BUSY ALWAYS FULL AND THEY'RE SORT OF A GAP IN LIKE IN THE CALLED AREAS ABOUT SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S THE SAME AND. IN ALL THE OTHERS WE SERVE WE HAVE MUCH MORE NEED THAN THAT WE CAN MEET SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR OUTREACH FOR THE CREDIT ITSELF BUT ALSO FOR VITA WITCHES SUZANNE SAID IS CONNECTED TO SO MUCH AWESOME BUILDING WORK THAT WE DO THANK YOU. YOU. TRACY PATTERSON OF CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE TOO MANY LOW WAGE WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY HUNGER IN POOR HEALTH IN THIS REALLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THAT CYCLE. BILLION. HI SHANTI PRASAD ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMUNITY FOOD BANK IN OAKLAND A WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ALL THE PIECES OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE SERVE ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY. AND ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WE SERVE. HAVE AT LEAST ONE WORKING HOUSEHOLD MEMBER. AND THEY ARE RECEIVING THERE OBVIOUSLY VERY VERY LOW INCOME. AND THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE WHICH CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF INCOME NEEDED BY COUNTY IN METRO AREA TO ATTAIN A MODEST YET ADEQUATE STANDARD OF LIVING SAYS THAT THE AMOUNT FOR A SINGLE PERSON WITHOUT CHILDREN. OUGHT TO LIVE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IS OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. NO ONE COMING TO OUR FOOD BANK MAKES EVEN HALF OR. A THIRD OF THAT. SO EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND SENIORS. AND TO IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WHO ARE WORKING. WOULD GREATLY DECREASE HUNGER ON IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WE SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COOPER MEMBERS KNOW AT BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE SERVE LOW INCOME RURAL FARMER TO COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE. WE IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC. CHARITY FOR OUR CONSTITUENT COMMUNITIES AND THIS PROPOSAL GOES A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS. WE ARE APPROVED AND SUPPORT THE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. WE SUPPORT THE EXPANSION TO YOUNG WORKERS AND THE WORKERS OVER SIXTY FIVE AND TO REMOVE THE EXCLUSIONS FAR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY MUST WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS WILL ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF ARE FOR BIG PARTNER BUT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT ALL THE PIECES OF THIS PAST. HI I'M KEVIN IN SCOPE WITH THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA AND LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING YET CALLIE ITC TO WORKERS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN. AND TWENTY FOUR. THIS WOULD AFFECT ABOUT OVER HALF A MILLION OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S A VERY CHALLENGING AND EXPENSIVE PLACE TO START OUT. MY DAUGHTER ATTENDS AN ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL SO I'VE METAL OF THE KIDS THAT WILL FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THEIR OWN AS SOON AS THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING TEMP JOBS MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. THEY'RE GONNA NEED THE SUPPORT EVERY DOLLAR WILL COUNT FOR THEM. AND I THINK WE NEED TO SEND THEM A MESSAGE THAT WE SUPPORT THEM. AND THAT WE HAVE THERE BACK IN THE WE WANT THEM TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA AND THRIVE HERE SO I HOPE WE CAN SEND THEM THAT MESSAGE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN IT IS JUST FRIDAY WITH CALLIE A CHEESY FOR ME WERE ONE OF THE STATEWIDE PARTNERS THAT WORK ON OUTREACH AND IMPROVING THE YET YOU SEE PROGRAM AND. ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF ALL THESE PROPOSALS TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IN AND INCREASES EFFECTIVENESS IN JUST ONE FINE POINT ON SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES WHICH HAS TO DO WITH WHOSE ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO FILE. THE THERE'S ALMOST A IN EQUIVALENT MATCH UP BETWEEN WHO'S REQUIRED TO FILE AND WHO'S ELIGIBLE. TO FILE AND SO IF WE LOOK AT THAT IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS INTUITIVELY IF YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO FIRE TAXES WHY WOULD YOU. UNLESS YOU KNEW ABOUT ONE OF THE TAX CREDITS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH IS WHY THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND MULTIPLE CHANNELS ALL THROUGHOUT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IS SO VITAL AND SO IMPORTANT AND WHY WE NEED TO DO MORE OF IT IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA MAKE THIS PROGRAM. CONTINUE TO SUCCEED AT THE LEVEL THAT IT COULDN'T SHOULD AND WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT POVERTY SO WE APPRECIATE YOU CONSIDERING ALL THESE OPTIONS IN THE POOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU SHIRTLESS CARRIER. LATER ON. YEAH I DON'T MIND HEARING BUT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. OKAY. FINISHING. VETERAN BOND WITH JUSTICE AN AGING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND IN PARTICULAR EXTENDING THE KELLY I DO SEE TO SENIORS WOULD. HAVE STRENGTHENED THE ABILITY OF THE CREDIT TO FIGHTS YOUR POVERTY. THE SENIORS ARE TODAY ARE ENTERING RETIREMENT WITH FEWER RESOURCES THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS PENSIONS ARE RARE AND THE AVERAGE WORKER DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE SUFFICIENTLY FOR RETIREMENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME RISING LEVELS OF INCOME INEQUALITY ARE PUSHING MORE SENIORS OUT OF ECONOMIC SECURITY AND INTO POVERTY. EVERYDAY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TURN SIXTY FIVE. BY TWENTY THIRTY BILL BE SEVENTY TWO MILLION SOON OF SENIORS IN AMERICA. OUR SENIOR POPULATION IS BECOMING LARGER AND PORTER. CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST YEAR POVERTY RATE OF ANY STATE. WHEN USING THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE WHICH FACTORS IN OUT OF POCKET MEDICAL EXPENSES AND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATIONS OF HOUSING COSTS. ONE OUT OF FIVE SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA IS LIVING IN POVERTY UNDER THIS MUCH A WHEN USING THIS MEASURE. AND ALSO SECURITY PROVIDES A FOUNDATION OF RETIREMENT PROTECTION. OF THE BENEFITS ARE MUCH MORE MODEST THAN MANY PEOPLE REALIZE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST OF LIVING. GIVEN THE REAL HIGH OF THAT GIVEN THE HIGH REAL POVERTY RATE. MANY MORE SENIORS CONTINUE TO WORK OUT OF NECESSITY JUST TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR A BE ABLE TO PAY FOR BASIC NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES HOUSE HOUSEHOLDS WHERE SENIORS ARE NOT ONLY TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. BUT ARE ALSO INFORMALLY TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RAISING THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. OR PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THEIR OWN ADULT ADULT CHILDREN WHO MAY ALSO BE WORKING PARENTS. THE CAL YOU TO SEE CAN PUT MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF LOW INCOME WORKING SENIORS. BUILDING ON THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND HELPING TO OF SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. LASTLY ON THE UPPER AGE LIMIT. WHAT WHILE THE SO SCRITTI FULL RETIREMENT AGE WAS SIXTY FIVE WHEN THE CAT TWENTY IDC WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED? THE FULL RETIREMENT AGE IS CURRENTLY SIXTY SIX AND FOUR MONTHS MS ALWAYS WE GRADUALLY TO SIXTY SEVEN BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SO THE SOVIET SIXTY FIVE AGE LIMIT DOESN'T REFLECT WAS SO SCREWED LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW. OR IN THE FUTURE AND IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR LAST SPEAKER. HAGGARD PETNAME'S POLLS HAVE FIVE WE GET UP WE HAVE A CHAIR LIKE RELIGION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL GIVEN REPRESENT IMMIGRANTS WHAT TIMES AND I KNOW. THE TAX CREDIT BUT AND ALSO OCT CANNOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL CREDIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ADD TO BE ABLE TO DO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. BUT THEN ALSO I BE PROSPEROUS AND GET SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MCCLOSKEY BUT PUBLIC COMMENT AND COME BACK TO MY. FELLOW. COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE SKIPPED OVER SO MY APOLOGIES. S. CAVIAR OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR I I JUST HAVE A QUESTION DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THE POLICY DECISION WAS TO NOT INCLUDE LOW INCOME EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS I MEAN THAT'S. IT WHO I WORKED ON EITC LAST YEAR IN MY MIND IS BLOWING BECAUSE I REALLY I REALIZED IT THERE'S THAT. SOLUTION AND I JUST WONDERED IF ANYBODY KNEW NUMBER ONE. I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE RATIONALE AND KNOW THAT ORIGINALLY WHEN THE CREDIT WAS CREATED IN THE MID SEVENTIES IT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EARLY NINETIES THAT IT WAS EXTENDED TO WORKERS WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTING CHILDREN. SO I BELIEVE THE AGE LIMIT WAS PART OF THAT DECISION BUT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL RATIONALE WAS. AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT. IT CURRENTLY ARE ELIGIBILITY SITS ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL EITC AND THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THE SEVENTIES. LATELY UM SO YOU KNOW BUT WE DON'T NEED TO STAY WITHIN THAT FEDERAL GUIDELINES YES SO THAT THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS AUTOMATIC I MEAN I UNDERSTAND ALL THIS ENERGY THAT'S GOING IN TO TEACH YOU KNOW? TEACHING AND TRAINING PEOPLE. OUT BUT I LOOK AT THE MAP AND IT'S NONE OF IT'S IN REALLY IN MY DISTRICT RACE BEEN HEAVILY. IN TERMS OF HEAVY CONCENTRATION I KNOW THERE'S SOME GREAT BY TO PROGRAMS IN MY LOCAL REGION I'VE VISITED AND VISITED THEM DURING THE TAX SEASON. BUT IT IT JUST SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ASK FOR MONEY THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ANYWAY. AND IF WE JUST MADE IT THE REVERSE WITH A PROCESS WHERE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. FDB DETERMINES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE GET THEM A CHECK IT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE ADMINISTRATIVELY MUCH CLEANER. AND WE'D REALLY GET THE MONEY TO WHERE IT'S GOING TO DO THE MOST GOOD SO EMPTY AND ANY. I'M I'M INTERESTED IN THAT I GUESS IS MY POINT AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO COST A LOT MORE BECAUSE IT JUST MEANS WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE WHO WERE GIVING PEOPLE MONEY THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AND. SOMETIMES WE TRY TO KEEP. FROM LETTING PEOPLE KNOW BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW AND WE HAVE SUCH AN INCOME GAP IN THE STATE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. TO MAE LOGICAL SENSE AND I REALLY APPRECIATED YOU COMING TODAY AND GET AND TELLING YOUR STORY MISS VEGA BECAUSE I. AM. EVERY DOLLAR MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN IN THE LIFE OF OUR FAMILY SINCE I'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET GET THE MONEY. MR TO. FIRST WHY ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE WE WERE JUST CHATTING ABOUT WHY IT ISN'T MADE AMERICAN. AND I TOLD HER SHE WAS INTERESTED AUTHORED A BILL IN THAT TO BE HAPPY TO JOINT AUTHORED THAT BILL. ARM SO I WOULD ASK THE COMMUNITY ADVOCATES IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. EITHER THIS YEAR IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND. EITC REFORMER OR OTHERS. AND I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT SINCE MY COLLEGE DAYS AND. IT'S BEEN NOW OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF OF OF KNOWING THAT THIS IS LIKELY THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTI POVERTY. TAX POLICY THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. AND WE KNOW IT IT IT LIST FOLKS OUT OF POVERTY IT ENCOURAGES WORK. AYE AND AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE COUNTRY WITH LOCAL HOUSING COSTS. AND THE DEEPEST INEQUALITY IN THE COUNTRY ARM WE HAVE TO EXPAND IT SO I WANT TO JUST I KNOW THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM BUT. I'M CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF MORE DOLLARS FOR OUTREACH IN FACT ABOUT REACH A I'D CERTAINLY ALSO SUPPORT EXPANDING THIS AND ALL THE DIRECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. CONTEMPLATED FOR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR OLDER FOLKS. TYPICALLY FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES MY MY ONE QUESTION I HAD FOR ADVOCATES. HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN REDUCING SOCIAL SERVICE EXPENDITURES ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT. WONDERING IF IF THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES ON THAT TOPIC BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT MY GUESS IS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND ON EARNING A TEXTURED OR SAVING FIFTY CENTS OR OTHERS. IN OTHER AREAS BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO QUOTE. NUMBERS ON THAT. I CAN TIME AND SAY THAT I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE EIGHTY SI AND I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS THE STUDY THAT'S LOOKED AT THAT. I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD BE TRUE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THERE'S A STRONG BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE EITC INCREASES EMPLOYMENT. PROCLAIMING SINGLE MOTHERS WHO ARE. THAT LARGEST BENEFICIARIES OF THE ACC SOARED ASSUME THAT WOULD BE TRUE BUT I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS ANY RESEARCH. MIDDLE SAFE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE HAD A A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT IN ANTI OF ACTION DOLLARS WHETHER BE FOR VIXEN DEFENSOR. HELPING SOMEONE WITH THAT ONE MONTH GAP ARMY CAN SAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS RELATED TO EVICTIONS AND HOMELESSNESS AND A LEGAL DEFENSE IN THE LONG RUN AND AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE IN THIS AREA BUT I JUST SAN. SEEN THAT DATA HOW TO SAY THAT ANECDOTALLY WE HEAR A LOT FROM CLIENTS THAT THEY USE THEIR EITC FOR TO STAY IN THEIR HOUSING. FOR FIRST IN ORDER TO GET INTO HOUSING. OR TO SAVE FOR HOUSING. THE LOT OF MUSIC FOR FIRST AND LAST WORD AVOIDED IT FICTION IF THEY LIZA. ROOMMATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ELSE I JUST WANNA SAY TO MISS NOT A BIGGER. OF THANK YOU YOUR VOICE IS SO IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE DON'T HERE IN THE CAPITAL SO THANK YOU FOR FOR SHARING. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. STRING. I THINK MISTER CHARGES ORDER THANK YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR. LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO TURN ON. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND TELLING YOUR STORY IT ACTUALLY IS. EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AT THE SPEAKER JUST MENTIONED HE HAD IN THE VENT. THIS LAST WEEKEND AND. THAT THE PERSON THAT THEY FACED THAT HE MET ON INACTION MEANT THE MONEY. HE GOT FOR YET TO SEE WAS TWO MONTHS RENT THE AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT. MONEY THAT THEY'RE JUST. PUTTING IN THEIR POCKETS BITS FOR RAN IT'S FOR A CAR IT'S FOR SOMETHING BIRDS ARE CRITICAL COULD BE FOR FOOD. SO AGAIN THESE ARE ON. YOUR STORY IS. POWER TO THIS POLICY AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO KATINA TELLS A THANK YOU FOR FOR DOING THAT. ARM BUT I. DID JUST TO ECHO THE COMMENTS EVER BEEN MADE. YOU KNOW I I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS WE HAVE FOR FIGHTING POVERTY. WE DO NEED TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET MONEY. INTO THEIR POCKETS ASSUME THEY DESERVE IT BECAUSE THEY'VE WORKED AND EARNED THESE DOLLARS IS JUST. GIVEN THE MONEY BACK SO ON. I DID WANNA ON ASK ASKING OF THE PANELISTS. WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK ARM OBVIOUSLY. POP POSSIBLY DUE TO THE EXPANSION BOND IF YOU'VE ANALYZED Y. WE'VE SEEN AN UPTICK UP TO THIS POINT. OF PHONE CREDITS BEING BEING PUT OUT AND AND WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM. IN TERMS OF AN ABSURDITY. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT SHE YES THERE'S BEEN A VERY LARGE UPTICK IN THE NUMBER OF EITC CLAIMS AND THAT. I'M I'M NOT SURE FORMAL ANALYSIS OF THE DONE I SUSPECT A VERY LARGE A NUMBER OF THAT IS DUE TO THE EXPANSION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE DID THE EXTENT EXPANSION WE EXTENDED THE INCOME LIMITS FROM FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND. AND A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE. SAY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THOSE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILING THEIR TAXES AND SO NOW THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. WAS AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME RANGE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE CREDITOR MAY NOT HAVE THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU. I'M I WOULD JUST THAT I RECEIVE SOME DATA JUST BEFORE THE HEARING THAT ALLOWS US TO COMPARE. THE CLAIMS THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE UNDER LAST YEAR'S RULE. OUT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN. ANY CHANGE IN SORT OF WHO WAS ELIGIBLE LAST YEAR SO THE BULK OF THE HIGHER CLAIMS IS REALLY COMING FROM THE EXPANSION. GREAT THANK YOU. NOT A CHOICE. I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA. CLAIMS TO MAY. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THREE. THOSE THAT ARE. THE DRASTIC DIFFERENCE OF FROM PRIORITY YEAR TWO THOUSAND. STEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AVERAGES SO. A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS APPOINTED FIFTY SEVEN. REYES SO. IT WAS SO OUR OWN MOSTA DOUBLER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND A FIFTEEN. EFFORT WAS SO FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO. AND. WITH A THREE DEPEND ON THE SO. LAST YEAR WAS SO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT. WHILE PRIOR YEARS WAS SO. ELEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT TO KNOW WHY THIS ACROSTIC CAUGHT YASSER THAT IS DUE ENTIRELY TO THE EXPANSION SO THAT THE THE THE DATA FURTHER TWENTY SEVEN TAX YEAR NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY NEWLY ELIGIBLE PEOPLE. WHO CLAIM THE CREDIT AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO BECAME ELIGIBLE UNDER LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION QUALIFY FOR MUCH SMALLER CREDITS SO THEIR INCLUSION BRINGS DOWN THE AVERAGE? MORE CLUES MORE PROCLAIMS SO THE MONTH OR SO SO MORE CLAIMS FROM PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY FOR SMALLER CREDITS. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDED WHO EARN BETWEEN SAY FOURTEEN ONE POT THE. THE MONEY YOU DISTRIBUTE THE WATER IS A BASED UPON MY QUALIFICATION I SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO SEE MY MOM. SO RIGHT SO WHEN I ACTUALLY RECEIVE DATA FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD JUST BEFORE THE HEARING THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO INCORPORATE IN MY HANDOUT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ACTUALLY COMPARE. OTHER PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY UNDER LAST YEAR'S RULES IN THIS YEAR'S RULES THERE'S BEEN NO DROP IN THE AVERAGE CREDIT FOR THOSE FOLKS THE DROP IN THE AVERAGE CREDIT IS ENTIRELY FROM PEOPLE WHO BECAME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT THIS YEAR. UP THE FOR EXAMPLE PARENTS WHO EARN BETWEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT. BUT THEY QUALIFY FOR VERY SMALL CREDITS COMPARED TO THE LOWER INCOME POPULATION THE QUALIFIED PREVIOUSLY. I THINK. OKAY I THINK THE PANEL FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION WAS VERY A ROBUST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ANOTHER NO BETTER VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. THERE WERE A VOTE ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE. FOR. AND CHIU. THEN LE ITEMS TWO THROUGH FIVE BUT ONLY. PRO. YOU. NEXT ONE ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN. STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUDGET OVERVIEW OKAY QUICK START WITH THAT FINANCE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. STEVEN PUBLIC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PURSUITS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT FINANCING OR TO A REVIEW BOARD MEMBER STAFFING LEVELS IN NEEDS IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S ENACTMENT OF AB ONE OF TWO. WHICH SHIFTED MOST THE BOARD EQUALIZATION'S RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED. DEPARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT AB ONE IT'S HE REDUCED EACH BOARD MEMBER STAFF IN. FROM SIX EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. A TO EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER THE BUDGET ACT ALLOWED THE BOARD MEMBERS TO RETAIN. ALL SIX OF THEIR EXEMPTS THAT. STAFF FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REVIEW FINANCE ADMITTED SERVICE EACH WORD MEMBERS OFFICE REQUESTS AND DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE WORKLOAD. FOR EACH OF THEIR TWELVE STAFF. SPECIFICALLY WE ASKED FOR A BREAKDOWN. OF A NUMBER OF HOURS EACH STAFF SPAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN COUNTY YOUR. INVOLVED IN NINE CATEGORIES OF WORK I THESE CATEGORIES ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE MISSION SCOPE OF DOE PRIOR TO AB ONE A TO ENACTMENT. WE RECEIVED SURVEYS BACK FROM EACH BOARD MEMBERS OFFICE. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE QUANTIFIABLE WHAT WOULD REDUCTIONS WE EXPECT TO SEE AN OVERALL WORKLOAD DECREASE OF ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. HE'S PROBABLY SEEN IN THREE WORKLOAD CATEGORIES. RESEARCHING AND RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES REGARDING TAX MATTERS WE EXPECT TO SEE REDUCTION EQUIVALENT TO FOUR PERCENT TOTAL WORKLOAD. ASSISTING WITH MATTERS RELATED TO TAX APPEALS WE EXPECT TO SEE A REDUCTION EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF TOTAL WORKLOAD. AND PERFORMING CONSTITUENT TAXPAYERS EDUCATION AVERAGE RESPECT SEE REDUCTION EQUIVALENT TO THREE PERCENT OF TOTAL WORKLOAD. OTHER WORKLOAD CARRIERS I SHOULD SEE VARIABLE DECLINE BUT THEY'RE NOT READILY QUANTIFIABLE. OVERALL RECOMMENDED STAFFING LEVEL FOR EACH OFFICES EIGHT POSITIONS. WE NOT BAD THE TO THE ONGOING TRANSITION ADMINISTRATION CONTINUE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY WERE GONNA LEVELS ARE PROPRIA AND LONG TERM. WITH THAT WOULD BE HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OIL. THANK YOU ARE BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES REPORT AND THE DATA SUBMITTED BY BOARD MEMBERS WE THINK. THAT FINANCES APPROACH LIKELY OVER ESTIMATES THE BOARD STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. BUT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE GETS INTO SPECIFICS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS THERE'S. A BIGGER PICTURE DECISION MAKE WHICH IS HOW TO. STRUCTURE BOARD MEMBERS OFFICES ARE CURRENTLY. GOVERNMENT CODE ONE FIVE SIX ZERO ZERO AFTER AUTHORIZES ONE DISTRICT OFFICE AND ONE OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO FOR EACH. BOARD MEMBER HOWEVER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. STATED THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT. FOR THE BOARD MEMBERS TO BE REGAL LOCATED IN TO ONE STATE ON SPACE AS THEIR. LEASES EXPIRE. SO. BEFORE SCRIPT DECIDING UPON A LEVEL FUNDING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT DEGREE OF BOARD MET OFFICE CONSOLIDATION IT DESIRES AND SO. CORRESPONDING TO THAT BIGGER PICTURE DECISION WE HAVE A TWO PART RECOMMENDATION CORRESPONDING TO. TWO POSSIBLE PATHS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE ON THAT PARTICULAR DECISION. I'VE THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WITH. I EIGHT SEPARATE OFFICES WITH COMPLETELY SEPARATE STAFF FOR EACH BOARD MEMBER. ARE UNDER THAT SCENARIO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED I SIX POSITIONS PER BOARD MEMBER. IF INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN A GREATER DEGREE OF CONSOLIDATION. OF OFFICE CONSOLIDATION IT'S POSSIBLE BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ACHIEVE. SOME ADDITIONAL SAVINGS BY HAVING. ALL BOARD MEMBERS COOL THEIR STAFF RESOURCES TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN THEY WOULD UNDER THAT SCENARIO. AND SERVE AS NOTED IN THE. AGENDA WE HAD ORIGINALLY REFERRED TO THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION WE LABEL THAT LONG TERM BUT. IT'S UNDERSTANDING ACTUALLY THAT ALL FOUR OF THE BOARD MEMBERS SACRAMENTO OFFICE LEASES EITHER WILL EXPIRE OR WILL MOVE TO SOFT TERM. BETWEEN MARCH AND JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO. PLAUSIBLY THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESSES IS A KEY DECISION POINT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT. DECISION ABOUT THE DEGREE OF CONSOLIDATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO. REALLY. HI THERE MIDDLE SHARE GEORGE RUNNER CHAIR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AMONG THEM I'M TO MAKES IN GENERAL COMMENTS IN REGARDS THAT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY UP HERE YOU HAVE. IN KENNY THE ET AND. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN FLEMING OUR DEPUTY. AND SELL LET ME JUST SPEAK IN GENERAL ARE TO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND THOUGHTS THAT WERE LAID OUT THERE. ALSO HAVE. BOARD MEMBER STAFF IS AVAILABLE HERE AYE AND WILL PROBABLY EITHER MAKE COMMENT OR WILL AGREE OR DISAGREE TO SOME DEGREE. IN REGARDS TO THE SHOULD THE THE THESE ISSUES. FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST LAY OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMS OF THE STAFF COMMENTS I THINK THE STAFF COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE. ARE ACTUALLY LAY OUT THE CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD AGREE WITH. I THINK THERE'S TWO MAIN ISSUES THERE. THE THE FIRST COMMENT IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF THE NUMBER OF STAFF. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE ALL OF US OF BOARD MEMBERS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ISSUE OF EIGHT STAFF WE THINK WE CAN WORK WITHIN THAT. I KNOW MEMBER HORTON HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT OPINION I THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED MEMBER HORTON'S. CORRESPONDENTS IN REGARDS TO THAT ALSO I THINK SOME DETAILED CORRESPONDS CITIES GIVEN IN REGARDS TO WHAT HE SEES A SOME LEGAL CHALLENGES IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE IN REGARDS TO UP. CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES TO THE ELECTED OFFICE SO I THINK THOSE ARE YOU GOT THOSE I'M SURE THOSE OF THE EFFORT FOR FOR DISCUSSION BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE EIGHT STAFF IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK WITHIN. WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IS THE NATURE THOUGH STAFF? ALL RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE STAFF LAYS OUT IS THAT WE HAVE TWELVE AND THAT WOULD BE. SIX THAT ARE EXEMPT AND SIX THAT ARE CIVIL SERVICE UNDER THE RECOMMENDATION THAT'S THERE IT GOES TO TWO ONE SIX. CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A HIGH IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF TO EXEMPT IS THE NATURE OF OUR WORK. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS I THINK IT'S VERY WE WE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY AND I GET LITTLE GO AGAIN THE ISSUE A FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT GIVES US SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY RIGHT NOW. BUT THE LIMIT US THEN TO TO I IN TERMS THE EXEMPT STAFF ISSUES I THINK CREATES AN ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOR US REGARD STOOD THAT LIMITS THAT ARE THERE. WHEN IT COMES TO CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO TALK THROUGH A WE THINK THAT THAT AGAIN WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES AND BE APPROPRIATE REGARDS TO HOW STAFF ASSIGNMENTS ARE MADE. YOU KNOW ONE SINCE I THINK AND I GUESS I COME BACK TO YOU AS A FORMER MEMBER BOTH IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. IN THAT I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE THAT'S UNIQUE IN THAT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IS WHEN YOU CAME INTO YOUR OFFICE. YOU HAD BASICALLY CONTROL OF YOUR STAFF IN TERMS OF WHO THEY WERE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS YOU GOT ELECTED YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE IN THE NOW AND AND AND AND AND ASSIGNMENTS. THAT'S VERY THAT WE'RE IN THAT SAME SENSE OF WERE ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND SO THE START WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ACTUALLY THAT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF OUR STAFF. THAT HERB BETTER BY DESIGNATION CIVIL SERVANTS MEANS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY ASSIGNED TO YOU. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT TELL YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR INTERVIEWS OR ANY OF THAT PROCESS BUT YET THEY'RE SERVING YOU THERE YOUR SECTION S. THERE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN YOUR OFFICE. IN MANY DIFFERENT HUESO AGAIN MORE FLEXIBILITY I THINK IS IMPORTANT THERE WE THINK THAT THE EIGHT IS A GOOD NUMBER WE DISAGREE UP WITH WITH THE LA SHOWS. WORK WE'VE GIVEN MORE INFORMATION WE DIDN'T WE WE HAD NO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALEJO AND I THINK NOW THE OFFICES DEBT. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THE INFORMATION THOUGH SINCE THEN WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DIALOGUE WITH US ON ON THAT ISSUE. IN IN REGARDS THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE I THINK THAT I WANT TO SPEAK TO IN REGARDS TO THE SIZE OF STAFF. WHILE THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BE. WE MET RESPONSIBILITY IS SMALLER NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE FACT IS THERE OTHER SERVICES TO WHICH WE NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO. FOR INSTANCE. IN IT IN IN THIS IS MUCH LIKE YOUR OFFICES IF YOU'RE TO CHOOSE TO DO A SEMINAR SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE YOUR CAUCUS STAFF THAT HELPS YOU DO A LOT OF THAT WORK. THAT SUPPLIES YOU INFORMATION THAT MAKES A LOT OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU. WE USED TO HAVE WHEN WE ARE THE BE ALL WE TOTAL WE USED TO HAVE AN OUTREACH THAT. THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE DOING A SEMINAR THOSE NO LONGER EXISTS TO US IN FACT IN LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION THERE'S A BIG FIREWALL PUT UP THERE. AND SO NOW ALL OF THOSE SERVICES THAT USED TO BE STAFF OR HELPED IN TERMS OF STOPPING WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF SIR OUTS REACH SERVICES FOR INSTANCE THOSE ISSUES. NO LONGER AVAILABLE WHICH MEANS ALTHOUGH SERVICES HAVE TO BE DONE IN THE HOUSE WITH OUR OWN STAFF. UP FOR INSTANCE GIVING OTHER SMALL ONE WEB SERVICES WE USED TO BE ABLE TO CALL ON OUR WEB SERVICE FOLKS IN ORDER TO HELP US WORK WITH ISSUES ABOUT PUTTING PRESS RELEASES UPPER OR OR OR MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS. WE NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. IN FACT WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE TOLD US WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVICING US IS YOU NEED TO HAVE A SPECIALIST IN YOUR OFFICE. IN ORDER TO DO THAT ALL THIS IS PUT MORE DEMAND ON US IN THOSE AREAS NOT LAST SO I WON'T LAY THOSE OUT THERE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO REQUEST LIKE. AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF TRANSITION. WE DO NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE THOUGHTS WERE IN REGARDS TO TO FINANCE IN REGARDS TO SOMEHOW THE EIGHT WAS ALREADY DECIDED LAST YEAR. NOW WE BELIEVE AGAIN IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THAT THE PURPOSE OF ASKING FANS TO GIVE A REPORT THIS YEAR IN APRIL WAS IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS THIS YEAR. AND SO WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE WE THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH THE NUMBER. THAT WE WE NEED TO DO IS TRANSITION THEN THROUGH THIS YEAR. THE FACT IS THAT TAKING TWELVE PEOPLE ARE TAKING SELF HAPPENED CUTTING THEM BY. TELLING FOR THEM MEANS A SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE BY BY BASICALLY THE PASSING A BUDGET WILL LEAST LOSE THEIR JOBS. IT'S INTERESTING TO SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE INDEED COULD BE CIVIL SERVICE PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT IT'S VERY UNIQUE IN OUR SITUATIONS THAT MANY OF OUR CIVIL SERVICE PEOPLE. DON'T DON'T HAVE RETURN RIGHTS TO THE TAX AGENCIES. AND SO WE HAVE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES THAT BASICALLY HAVE. TURN RIGHTS. THE BILL WE MEMBERS OFFICE BUT THE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN CUT IN THE BE ALWAYS OUT MEMBERS OFFICE SO THEY PERCEIVE THEY ARE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT RETURN RIGHTS. OUR AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A PROBLEM SO WE THINK AGAIN TRANSITIONING MAKES SENSE. HELPING US THEN A THEN UP THROUGH THIS YEAR AND THEN MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THEN FOR JANUARY FIRST MAKES A LOT OF SENSE SO. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. AGAIN I'M I'M SURE THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES MOTHER MEMBERS OFFICES MORE WHERE POSITIONAL OF MISS HARKNESS SAYS MOMENT MINUTE MANY MEMBERS OF MY STAFF. VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED THEIR POSITIONS DO OTHER WRESTLING IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES DECISION TO LEAVE WAS BASED IN PART ON THE POSSIBLE CHANGES WHICH THEY REFERRED FOR MAYBE ONE OR TWO RIGHT SO THE INFERENCE WAS THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IF ILLEGAL COULD COMMENT ON THE EXAM I'M SORRY FINANCE ON THE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. ON THAT ISSUE. AND I'M KRYSTLE PARTNER FINANCE IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSED LEVEL STAFFING FOR EXEMPTS. WHEN WE WHEN WE GET OUR REPORT WE JUST LOOKED AT OVERALL WORKLOAD. DEMANDS AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT EXEMPTS THE SUPPOSED TO CIVIL SERVICE PER SE FOR MAKING FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS WORDS LOOKING OVERALL WORKLOAD. AND I JUST CANCELED OUT TO THIRTY PERCENT. DECLINE IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND THAT DOES CORRESPOND TO THE. THE LOSS OF THE FOR EXAMPLE SESSIONS THAT. ARE SUPPOSED TO TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PURSUANT TO ARM THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT SO. ON THAT'S HOW WE FIND OURSELVES WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. BUDGET TING. IT'S JUST A QUESTION FURTHER FOR THE CHAIR COMMUTE COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ARM. AT LEAST WITH YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY THE THE SIX CIVIL SERVICE STOP WITH THOSE STAFF ASSIGNED TO YOU BASED ON. BURN THE RECEIPT YOU INHERITED OR DID YOU HIRE THEM AND THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OR DID YOU HAVE TO HIRE THEM FOR THE GOOD AND GOOD HEARTEDNESS IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S A BET IT'S BEEN A BIT OF THAT A BIT OF A MOVING TARGET. TRADITIONALLY. WHEN A BOARD MEMBER WAS ELECTED. AT THE BO WE. AND WE CAME INTO THAT OFFICE THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME CIVIL SERVICE IN THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME EXEMPT. IN THE PAST WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE AGAIN BE A WE WITH A VERY BIG ORGANIZATION THAT POINT. SO AT THE PASS IN THAT POINT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE INCOMING BOARD MEMBER. WOULD LOOK AT THEIR STAFF AND WE DETERMINE WELL I'M I THINK I'D LIKE TO. THE COULD BASICALLY CHIU CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SENSE OF OF OF OF IF SOMEBODY NEEDED TO MOVE ON THEY COULD MOVE AMMAN. BUT THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE DEAL WE SEE. ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF WOULD ABSORB THEM WITHIN THE BILL WE ORGANIZATION. SO THEY NEVER LOSE A POSITION AT THAT POINT. THEY ALWAYS THEN STAY WITHIN THE BE. WE THEY WOULD GO INTO HEADQUARTERS ARE GOING TO DISTRICT OFFICE OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT. AT THAT POINT THEN THERE WOULD BE A NEW SOLICITATION. FOR A CIVIL SERVICE POSITION TO WHICH THEN THE BOARD MEMBERS NOR MEMBER WAS INVOLVED IN. NOW THE NEWER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT'S TAKING PLACE AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT THAT WAS NOT A PROPER PROCESS AGAIN IT WAS JUST THE ONE THAT THE PROCESS THAT WAS IN PLACE FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW FOREVER. NOW THE PROCESS TIAS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS WHO ARE EXISTING IN A CERTAIN IN A MEMBER'S OFFICE LIKE IN MINE. A NEW MEMBER MORE MEMBER COMES UP IN. THEY BASICALLY HAVE THOSE CIVIL SERVANTS. THERE'S NO CHOICES AT THAT POINT THEY STAY IN THAT OFFICE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THEM OR MAKE THEM OR ABSORB THEM. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A PRACTICAL ISSUE TO NOW WITH THE SMALLNESS OF THE VIEW WE THERE JUST NOT THAT MANY PLACES TO PUT SOMEBODY RIGHT. SO THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE. AND AGAIN. ONE THE ONE OF THE ON IT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LAST YEAR WAS AGAIN THIS ISSUE OF OF RETURN RIGHTS. WE'VE CIVIL SERVANTS WHO BASICALLY HAVE NO RETURN RIGHTS NOW. AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THE INTERPRETATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY SOME OF THE ARM THREE A HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENTS IN REGARDS THE FACT SOME OF MY STAFF WHO ORIGINALLY WERE IT WOULD BE A WE. SHOULD HAVE RETURN RIGHTS BACK TO THE TAX AGENCIES RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T. AND INTER IN AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT IF THEY WERE TO LOSE THEIR POSITION. THEY BASICALLY END UP. WITHOUT PROTECTION BUT THE SAME THE EMPLOYEES IN THE CAPITAL TO THOUGH. RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE CAPITAL SEE THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT A MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS BUT YOUR PEOPLE ARE NOT PROTECTED WITH CIVIL RIGHTS OR CIVIL CIVIL SERVICE PROTECTION. WILL FOURTH OCCUR AT ITS DEBT PRIOR STATUS. IN CIVIL SERVICE. THEY COULD GO BACK GO BACK YES BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS IF SOMEBODY FOR INSTANCE WITH SOME PEOPLE ON A BEEN IN OUR IN OUR OFFICES. PRIOR TO ME THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE BEEN IN MEMBERS OFFICES FOR GOODNESS SAKE I THINK GO TO TO TO. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS THEY NEVER WORKED WITHIN THE TAX AGENCY. BUT THEY'VE BEEN A BILL WE EMPLOYEE. THEY JUST WORK IN OFFICE THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO RETURN TO THEN UNDER THIS UNDER THIS SCENARIO SO AGAIN WE THINK IT CAN BE FOR. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS TO FIX THAT NUMBER ONE. IF YOU JUST GIVE RETURN RIGHTS TO TO BE A WE EMPLOYEES BACK TO THE TAX AGENCIES THAT WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. THE OTHER ISSUE IS AGAIN GIVE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE INCOMING MEMBER BY TRADING OFF AT LEAST. YOU KNOW GOING FROM AT LEAST TWO TO FOUR AND THAT GIVES A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT STILL MEANS THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS CAN HAVE TO KEEP SOME OF THE STAFF THAT THE COME INTO. AS THEY COME INTO OFFICE. SO JUST JUST TO CLARIFY SO YOU SEE YOU. YOU FEEL THAT THE YOU AND SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS NOT NOT ALL IN THE SAME ITEM. WOULD BE OPEN TO UP FOR EXEMPT AND FORCE OF. THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT IS PRESENTED BEFORE US WITH THE FINANCE WORK MANAGING GIVES US ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT SO SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THE MORE FLEXIBILITY THE BETTER OF HIM I THINK I'VE GOT SOME OTHER MEMBERS WOULD SAY THEY SHOULD ALL BE EXEMPT RIGHT. BUT I THINK ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD. TOWARD AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THE IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE TO HAVE ALL A. B. EXAM VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR OFFICE. THANK YOU. AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO RAISE ONE POINT COM FIRST FINANCES ARE PROPOSALS NOT REDUCING THE CIVIL SERVICE STAFF AT ALL. AND SECONDLY. IF FOR SOME REASON THE CIVIL SERVICE STAFF MEMBER REDUCED IF YOU'RE HIRED TO THE CIVIL SERVICE PROCESS SUPPORT EQUALIZATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNED A BOARD MEMBER. BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING HOW CIVIL SERVICE WORK SHE WOULD HAVE RETURN RIGHTS TO THAT AGENCY. IT'S LIKE A PARTNER FINANCED WITH PEOPLE WE FINANCE ALL THE TIME TO TAKE JOBS THE LEGISLATURE THEY WOULD HAVE RETURN RIGHTS BACK TO FINANCE THAT IS NOT THE WAY THAT THE THAT THAT HUMAN RESOURCES IS RESPONDING AYE OF INDIVIDUALS IN MY OFFICE THAT ACTUALLY. CAME AT THAT CAME OUT OF THE LATE KIM LEGISLATE ROOM LEGISLATURE WENT AND WORKED FOR THE BILL WE AND THEN CAME FROM THE EFFORT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THEN CAME TO MY OFFICE. AND THEY'VE BEEN TOLD AND I WAS IN THERE AND I WAS IN THE MEETING WITH THEM WITH WITH WITH CALLAHAN THAT KELLY CHORE BUT WITH THE TAXI DID SEE. THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THOSE RIGHTS SO AGAIN I I DISAGREE WITH THEIR INTERPRETATION I DO AGREE WITH YOURS THAT THAT THAT'S BILL WE HR I. BUT TALK. WE DON'T HAVE ONE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE KNOW WHERE NOW SERVICES THAT THEY JUST KNOW I'M ONE THING IS YOUR THING. PRIOR WRITTEN ABOUT KELLY CHORE THAN NO NO PRIOR PRIOR WE HAD OUR OWN HR WHAT AT THAT TIME TALKING ABOUT SO WITH THAT THE PRIORY CHARGE THEY KNOW THAT WAS THE CURRENT OKAY JUST WHICH IS AGAIN A. WHICH IS THE TAX AGENCY WHO NOW IS GIVING US. SERVICE. YET DEPARTMENT JACKSON BUTTE MINISTRY RIGHT PROVIDES THEIR HUMAN RIGHT HUMAN RESOURCES. WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT FOREVER. THAT THAT IS SO FULL OF OF THE CIVIL SERVICE YEAH I'M IT WOULD LOWER HIS OR WE BEGIN AGAIN I THINK THE BROADER THAT'S IT THAT'S AT ISSUE THAT OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSED BUT. BROADER ISSUE IN REGARDS WHAT'S BEFORE YOU IS I THINK THE NUMBER THE LEVEL OF STAFF IN THOSE CONDITIONS CAN MAKE ONE QUICK REMARK IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE THE BILL WE ABOUT CONDUCTS HOLIDAYING STAFF ISSUES ARE WITH ONE OFFICE. AGAIN MY OFFICE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT MIKE SACRAMENTO OFFICE AT MY DISTRICT OFFICE ON A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE OF THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS. IN THAT SENSE ARM. BUT THE PROBLEM WILL BE WITH ASSURING STAFF IS WE BAGLEY KEENE ISSUES. AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE STAFF THAT ARE SERVICING TWO DIFFERENT MEMBERS. IT BECOMES A PROBLEM IN REGARDS TO CONVERSATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF BECAUSE THEY'RE STAFF IS NO LONGER JUST THERE'S. SO I THINK IT BEGS BAGLEY KEENE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT I WOULD BE CAN. IN THE COURSE ISN'T COMMITTEE. I DON'T MEMBERS. ARE GOING UP AND UP ERNIE COMES FROM. NUMBER NUMBER STAFF. BOB WE'RE JUST HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. OKAY. JOHN OF EACH APPOINTED CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE CHAIR FIONA MA. ON IN REGARDS TO THE THEY ANALYSIS. YEAH I'M NOT SURE IF. STAFF SCOPE OF WORK WAS ANALYZE BETWEEN ON. EXEMPT AND CIVIL SERVICE BECAUSE. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THERE IS A REDUCTION IN A SCOPE OF WORK AND TAX RELATED NEXUS. WORK HOWEVER. YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT DEPARTMENT FINANCE RECOMMENDATION IS NOT TO DECREASE CIVIL SERVICE STAFF HOWEVER MOST OF THAT WORK IN OUR OFFICE. ON. AND I TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR OFFICE IS WITHIN CIVIL SERVICE AND SO WE WOULD PREFER THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE ARE EXEMPT. THE ZIP THIS IS OUR STATUE CORRECT. CRACKED. BUT AND I AM JUST MAKING A NOTE A BASED ON THE YOU THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF RECOMMENDATIONS IS BASED ON STOCK PRODUCTION. BUT MOST OF OUR. CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS CARRY. TAX COUNSEL THREES AND TAX ON. TAX SERVICE POSITIONS WITH THE QUESTION WOULD BE HOW THE BILL YOU WHO THE WORKLOAD COMPARE NOW TO PREVIOUS YEARS. SOURCE HEARINGS. SO I. OUR AND WORKLOAD HAS DECREASED DRAMATIC DRAMATICALLY. HI A HAS BASED ON YOU KNOW HEARINGS AS I AND YOU KNOW AS. IN IN OUR EXPERIENCE HOWEVER. AND AS. CHAIR. RUNNER HAS MENTIONED. THE REPORTS TOLL ON REFLECT A DECREASE IN RESOURCES AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT IS TO SPEAK ABOUT THERE WAS. YOU NO THERE IS NO TRANSITION TRAINING FOR BE IT FOR BOARD MEMBER STAFF FOR BOARD MEMBERS OF THERE'S NO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND I LIKE TO PASS OUT SUMMITEERS OUR OFFICE HAS. HAS DONE IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OUTREACH TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE ARE STILL IN ELECTED OFFICE WE STILL ARE OF OBLIGATED TO EDUCATE OUR. CONSTITUENTS WE STILL GET CALLS ABOUT UP BO EAST OR CD TFA TAXES THAT WE STILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE AND HELP NAVIGATE OUR CONSTITUENTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT STILL TAKES TIME. JUST BECAUSE WE GET A CALL ON TAXES DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS WHAT YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK I AGAIN I THINK THE IDEA OF THE FIRST NARROW THE SMALLER FOOTPRINT I AGREE WITH THE FACT IS. WE DON'T WE DON'T CONTROL WHO CALLS OUR OFFICES. AND SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE GET A CALL ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO'S AT THE INCOME TAX QUESTIONER THOSE OTHER ISSUES I'M THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE END UP HAVING TO RESPOND TO THOSE AND QUITE FRANKLY WE BACK YOU GUYS UP IN THAT ISSUE TOO BECAUSE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF YOUR WE HAVE MUTUAL CONSTITUENTS. AND SO BY THAT TIME WE ARE DEALING WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SO THE IDEA OF ATTACKS COUNSEL. A CPA ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HELP GUIDE INDIVIDUAL. CONSTITUENTS MUTUAL CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL SHARE AGAIN IF THE I WANNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE EXAMPLE ABOUT FOOTPRINT EVEN OUR FOOTPRINT IS SMALLER. OUR RESOURCES THAT WE COULD CALL ON NOW DON'T EXIST FOR INSTANCE IN THE PAST IF I WANTED A BROCHURE PRINTED. IN ORDER TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR VETERANS I HAD A WHOLE AGENCY THAT WOULD GO AHEAD AND SET THAT UP WORK ON THAT DEAL WITH THAT. THAT NO LONGER EXISTS FOR US. ALL THAT HAS TO BE DONE NOW BY OUR OWN STAFF. AND SO. AGAIN I GET WITH WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T GO TOO FAR IN THEN LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IT WE HAVE AWFUL CALLS TO. WRITE COOPER FOR IN THOSE FOLKS OBVIOUSLY FROM YOUR PHONE CALLS REFERRING TO CTF A CERTAIN WELL KNOW IT WELL AGAIN THERE AGAIN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REFERRING A PHONE CALL AND HELPING A CONSTITUENT THROUGH THE PROCESS BY IS IF WE GET THOSE SAME CLOCK NO DISTRICT OFFICES SO. RIGHT JUST BECAUSE YOU TAKE PHONE CALLS DOES MEAN THAT. RESULTS IN THEIR WORK PRODUCT WELL TO DO A LOT OF REFERRAL SING FOLKS ELSEWHERE WE ARE THERE SOME PRODUCT THAT RESULTS FROM THAT BUT. EVERY PHONE CALL WAS NOT RESULT. IN WORK BEING DONE WELL I AGREE ALTHOUGH AT LAST YEAR WE HAD FOUR THOUSAND CONTACTS WITH CONSTITUENTS OF WHICH MOST OF THEM TOOK MORE THAN ONE PHONE CALL THEIR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HELPING THROUGH A VERY CONFUSING TAX PROCESS. AND AS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THAT WE USE TO BUILD TO DO IS TAKE YOUR CONCERNS AND GIVEN TO US AND THEN WE WOULD DEAL WITH THE. ARE AND SO I THINK AGAIN. I ONLY SAID THE FOOTPRINT HAS CHANGED BUT IT'S CHANGING A LOT NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AGAIN GO BACK TO THE BASIC ISSUE WE THINK IT WILL WORK WE JUST NEED FLEXIBILITY. IT ALSO HAS BEGUN THIS. I GOT UP LOOKED OF PUBLIC COMMENT. USE OF THIS EFFORT. I AM LEASE OR NOT A CHIEF OF STAFF FOR DIANE HARKEY. AND I COME FROM UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE IN THAT I'M A THIRTY YEAR VIEW EMPLOYEE. WHO HAPPENED TO COME FROM WHAT IS NOW CITY TFA? I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT STAFF I THINK WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED I'VE A THIRTY YEAR AUDITOR WHO'S BEEN TOLD SHE MAY BE SURPLUS TO. AND THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN OUR STAFF SHOULD GO BACK TO SEA DUTY IF THEY WHERE THEIR STRENGTHS AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OLIVER STAFF SHOULD BE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES OF VARYING LEVELS SIMILAR TO IT LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. SO THAT. OUR CURRENT STAFF CAN GO BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME OR WHETHER SKILL SET ARE. AND THEN WE COULD HAVE ON THE STAFF. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT FOR THE NEXT MEMBER THAT COMES AND COULD HIRE WHO THEY WANT TO. SIX. PUT CURRY HAVING CHIEF OF STAFF FOR BOARD MEMBER JOE MARTIN THANK YOU CHAIR RUNNER FOR GIVING A PRESENTATION TODAY. AND WE ARE NOT IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT NUMBER. THE EIGHT. AND WE ARE OPEN TO. WHATEVER MIX THE DISCUSSIONS I WOULD JUST HOPING THEIR OPEN DISCUSSIONS ON THE NEXT STEP. OF WHAT LEVEL OF SAPPY WE HAVE PROFESSIONAL LEADING WHETHER THEY'RE EXEMPT SEE EA'S OR A MIX OF CIVIL SERVICE AND THAT. AND WHERE HOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE WE HAVE PRESENTED YOU WITH ON A COUPLE OF MEMOS WITH ATTACHMENTS THAT WE'RE HOPING YOU WOULD CONSIDER WE PROVIDED THEM TO THE ALLEY O. AND DO AFTER WE'VE HAD. SOME SHORT CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND WE WERE HAPPY THAT YOU'RE I'M OPEN TO INFORMATION AFTER THE SURVEYS. WE'VE TRIED TO DO ANY EIGHT SOME OF THE NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH. THE CONSTITUENT BASE WITH THE REDUCED OR THE MORE FOCUSED A WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH ARE CONSTITUTED CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES OF THE MEMBERS. AYE A. WOULD LIKE TO. WE ALSO SUPPORT THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE TYPE OF WORKLOAD THAT HAS COME TO THE MEMBERS OFFICES WERE NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. OVER THE EIGHT THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AYE RECOMMENDS WE THINK THERE ARE SOME LEGAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW MEMBERS TO CONSOLIDATE AND SHARE STAFF. IN A SACRAMENTO OFFICE ON THAT WE BE OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL. AND AS FAR AS A TRANSITION PERIOD REDUCING THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION. POSITIONS ARE CUT IN BUDGET AXE AND THERE ARE SURPLUS IN S. R. AWAY LISTS THEIR CREATED FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND HISTORIES CALIFORNIA. THIRTY FIVE YEARS STATE EMPLOYEE I'M ONLY VAN WITH A COLLECTED BOARD MEMBERS AN EXACT POSITION FOR LESS THAN FOUR YEARS. SO I DO UNDERSTAND THERE IS THAT PROCESS IN THIS CASE LIKE MR RUNNER HAD AN ILLUSTRATED IS THAT. THESE EMPLOYEES THAT CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE NEXT BUDGET ACT AT THOSE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS CHANGE OF THEIR EXACT POSITIONS THAT ARE. SET OF CIVIL SERVICE AND. THEY WERE HIRED TO AN AGENCY AND SO IN THE PAST. ASSEMBLY RETAINING. THE AGENCY ACTUALLY HIRED THE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES THEY BELONG TO THE POV. AND WHENEVER THERE WAS A CHANGE IN ASSIGNMENT BECAUSE AGENCIES ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE CIVIL SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS WITHIN AN AGENCY WITHOUT ADVERTISING IF THERE IS A NEED TO TRANSFER THEM. SOMETIMES THAT DID OCCUR WHEN BOARD MEMBERS. TURNED OUT AND LEFT OFFICE IN NEW MEMBERS CAME IN. BUT THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE HIRED BY THE DOD WHERE MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN INTERVIEWS AND THE SELECTION PROCESS. THE RECRUITMENT OF THOSE THINGS THE HR MATTERS THE APPROVAL OF THOSE THINGS THE. UP PROBATIONARY PERIODS THE PERMANENT STATUS WAS AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER AGENCY CO THAT WAS FOR BOARD MEMBERS OFFICE. AND SO IN THIS SITUATION I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE INTERPRETING UNLESS YOU CAN TELL US DIFFERENTLY. THAT NOW WE ARE FUNCTIONALLY AND BUDGETARY EARLY INDEPENDENT FROM THE BE A WE AS AN AGENCY ALMOST CREATING TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES AND THESE EMPLOYEES. THAT MAY HAVES AND STARTED THEIR CAREERS AS APPEALING PLAY PASS PROBATION AS A BE A WE EMPLOYEE. AND NOW HAVE ONLY RETURN RIGHTS TO IT WHERE MEMBERS OFFICE IN A POSITION AT WAIT MAY HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED SO THROUGH A BUDGET ACT. THEIR RETURN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IF ANY THERE ARE BUT I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE LOOK THROUGH A TRANSITION PROCESS. AND. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED. WE ALSO AND JUST HAVE A LEGAL QUESTION WERE NOT SURE HOPEFULLY MAYBE SOME AS WE DISCUSS THE CLASSIFICATION. OF THE POSITIONS OF THE MOVE BOARD IS. DO THE BOARD MEMBERS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAD EXAM HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO HIRE CIVIL SERVICE SO THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS THAT IS OUR IN THE CURRENT DATA BUDGET AX. THAT LIMIT OUR PARTICIPATION IN BOARD EMPLOYEES WERE JUST WONDERING WHETHER THAT FALLS TRUE FOR A BOARD MEMBERS OFFICE AS WELL BUT WE ARE NOT IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE NUMBER. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO OF HAD. OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CLASSIFYING AND HOW THIS COMMITTEE OR THE OTHER COMMITTEES WILL DECIDE THAT. OR TO HAVE A SPECIAL WITH CAL HR ABOUT CIVIL SERVICE NAY SIMPLICITY BRING THAT BACK THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY. TRYING TO YOUR SEVERE. THE QUESTIONS YOU FAST RECOVER ARE CLARIFIED. YEAH AND I BELIEVE MISTER RUNNER HAD TALKED ABOUT. THE HR DEPARTMENT AT CD FTA THAT IS PROVIDING THAT THE SERVICE AND THE INFORMATION THAT PROVIDING THE EMPLOYEES AND I. BELIEVE THERE PROVIDING INFORMATION BASED UPON THE CURRENT SCENARIO AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GIVE US A LEGAL ANSWER OF SOMETHING THAT. HASN'T HAPPENED YET RIGHT. SO WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE KALINJAR SPV COMING AND AND. I THINK I WOULD I IMPORTANT AND WOULD BE GLAD TO GIVE THE GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY I GET REALITIES THIS COMES DOWN TO REAL PEOPLE. THIS A THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEXT JOB STATUS SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION NO AND WE WILL DO THAT'S RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. THAT THAT'S ONE THING THE STATE BEING HERE I MEAN EVERY XEGS IS HEATHER ON A CHARTER PARTNERSHIP CAL HR. YOU GET DIFFERING OPINIONS THAT'S ONE FRUSTRATING THING WITH THE STATE. IT'S LIKE I SAID I'VE HAD SOME EXAMPLES ON THIS AND THAT'S ONE THING WE GOT A CLEAR UP. AND FIX THAT OVERALL THAT IS AN ISSUE I AGREE WITH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK A PRAYER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF. TAXPAYER ADVOCATES THERE IT STATE WIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PROPERTY TAX AGENTS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF A EXEMPTS VERSUS NON EXEMPT. BUT WE DO WANT TO CAUTION THE COMMITTEE OF THAT AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BO EASE BUDGET THAT THERE ARE EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PROPERTY TAX. ARENA. WHETHER THEY ARE FOLKS ARE REPRESENTED BY A TAX AGENT OR ARE CALLING ON THEIR OWN THEY ARE STILL LOOKING TO THE BE AWAY FOR INFORMATION OR HELP. THAT THEY MAY I'LL. WISH A DIRECTION OR INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN'T GET. FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE SO WE WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU WOULD BE MINDFUL OF THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO WITH ALL THIS ITEM OPEN SWOOP ON OUR NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FIGHTING TAX CREDIT TO THE BILL LANGUAGE GOOD AFTERNOON THAT IT TAKES HIM APARTMENT FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA HIRING CREDIT. HOW THIS CREDIT WOULD BE AN EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT? ON THE NEW CREDIT IS CALCULATED TO THE SAME SET THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF QUALIFIED WAGES HAS THE EXISTING CREDIT. ON. IT WOULD BE EXPANDED IN SEVERAL WAYS BY GEOGRAPHY BY INDUSTRY BY THE RANGE OF QUALIFIED RE A WAGES. HOW THE NEW CREDIT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR HIRES HONOR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR? A FOR ALL BUT A BACKGROUND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SEVERAL BILLS THAT. EMANATED ENTERPRISE ZONE CREDITS NAM. I CREATED NEW TAX INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE NEWLY CREATED TAX INCENTIVES WAS NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT. THEIR CREDIT HOUSE HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZE A VERY MUCH HOW THEY HAVE TO BE HAS A WHICH WHICH ADMINISTERS. THE CREDIT REPORTS THERE WAS LESS THAN FOUR MILLION CREDITS CLAIMED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. AND LESS THAN TWO MILLION EACH IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INTENDS TO CREATE A NEW CREDIT THAT HAS THE SAME GOALS AS THE ORIGINAL CREDIT. AND THAT IS TO CREATE JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY STRUGGLE TO FIND. HARD TO FIND WORK DUE TO THE PERSONAL HISTORY. A BUT THE THEN NEW CREDIT IS DESIGNED TO BE MORE USEFUL A TO BE UTILIZED FOR. HOME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A A STRONGER INCENTIVE THE TRAILER BILL. CREATES A CREDIT THAT EXPANDS ON THE CURRENT CREDIT IN SEVERAL WAYS. OF FIRST THE WAY DRAIN FOR QUALIFIED WAGES WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE THE CURRENT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT HAS A RANGE OF HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT THREE AND FIFTY PERCENT. THE NEW CREDIT WOULD APPLY TO QUALIFIED HIRES AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA AS OPPOSED TO JUST DESIGNATED. RETURNS IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY THE TYPE OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS WOULD BE EXPANDED UNDER THE NEW CREDIT. TO INCLUDE RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICES. ANOTHER ANOTHER CHANGES AT THE NEW CREDIT WOULD USE THE MAXIMUM OF. THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT CREDIT. WHICH JUST RELIES ON THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RETAIN SEVERAL FEATURES OF THE EXISTING OUR CREDIT. THE CATEGORIES FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES SAY THE SAME LONG TERM A A INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED. VETERANS EX OFFENDERS RECIPIENTS OF CAL WORKS OR HOME. OUR GENERAL ASSISTANCE AND OF RECIPIENTS OF THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. ADDITIONALLY OUT TO CLAIM THE CREDITS EMPLOYERS ARE STILL REQUIRED. TO MAKE A CREDIT RESERVATION WHEN THEY HIRE THE EMPLOYEE THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE. THEIR RECORDS A NET INCREASE IN JOBS FOR THE YEAR AND ME. AND THEY'RE REQUIRED TO CLAIM THE CREDIT ON AN ORIGINAL FILED RETURN. THE EXISTING CREDIT WOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST FOR ANY EMPLOYERS WHO WISH TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT CREDIT AND UNTIL IT'S NORMAL SUNSET DATE. I AND WE WOULD INCLUDE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL TO PRECLUDE A EMPLOYER FROM TAKING THE SAME CREDIT FOR ONE SET HER UP. DID THE TWO CREDITS FOR ONE EMPLOYEE. ARMED THE NEW CREDIT IS EXPECTED TO COST ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ONCE IT IS FULLY PHASED. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE OIL. OF BROWN WITH THE FORD AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE A STRONGER INCENTIVE A TO BUSINESSES TO HIRE. THE TARGETED INDIVIDUALS BUT WE DO THINK THAT A MORE FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING WOULD BE NEEDED. TO PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESSES TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS THOSE INDIVIDUALS A TRULY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT SO. WE'D RECOMMENDED. THAT IF THE GOAL OF THIS CREDIT IS TO BRING INDIVIDUALS THAT FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT INTO THE WORKFORCE. PROVIDING A LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNT TO THE LOWER WAGE. WOULD BE I'M HELPFUL SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HIRE SOMEONE JUST ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE ON THEIR THE EMPLOYERS ONLY GOING TO BE GETTING. OF A FAIRLY SMALL AMOUNT. TIRE THAT INDIVIDUAL AND. YOU KNOW IF IF FIFTIES OR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE THEY MIGHT NEED SOMETHING MORE IN THE LINE IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THAT INCENTIVE TO. BRING THEM INTO THE WORKFORCE. AND. AND IN THOSE LINES WE WE ALSO RECOMMENDED. YOU KNOW. ALLOWING IT FOR YOU KNOW ALL EMPLOYERS. AND. INTO MAYBE EVEN CONSIDERING PUT PART TIME EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS MIGHT PREFER PART TIME POINT SO ANYWAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU PICK MILLION EXPLANATION WHY THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE AT. THE RETAIL FOOD INDUSTRY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE CREDIT. YEAH ARM SO SO IT WAS CONSIDERED THOSE TWO INDUSTRIES WOULD WOULD. WOULD BRING IN THE MOST WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE HIRED HIRING THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WHO HAVE WHO ARE HARD HIGHER. CARILLO. YEAH I HAVE A HARD TIME. AYE AYE. TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND. THERE'S NO QUESTION WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HIRE THE HARDEST. THE HARDEST TO HIRE THE CHALLENGE WITH THE RETAIL IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS YOU'LL END UP WITH. UNLESS THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THE NATIONAL CHAINS THAT DON'T NEED THESE KIND OF INCENTIVES IT'S THE SAME THING AND LOCAL LAND USE I JUST IT DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN THERE'S A TAX INCENTIVE FOR A LOS TO COME INTO THE COMMUNITY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'LL BUILD THERE IF THEY. WANT TO ANYWAY SO I GUESS I'M I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CONCEPT I GUESS I'D I JUST I'M NOT I'M JUST NOT SURE. I'M NOT SURE WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS TO INCENTIVIZE BUSINESS FOR GROWTH ON UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING THAT SAYS LOOK WHAT WE REALLY WANT IN THIS STEVE MANUFACTURING NOT MORE NOT MORE RETAIL AND MORE FOOD. NOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THERE AND I IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING SOME OF THE GREEN. AT TECH INDUSTRIES TO LOOK AT MANUFACTURING BACK IN THE STATES SO THAT WE CAN PUT PEOPLE INTO JOBS THAT ARE LONG TERM. WHERE WE'RE MAKING MAJOR INVESTMENTS FOR AT FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE? UP AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCENTIVIZE HE'S BUSINESSES STARTING IN PRODUCING. THAT THE PANELS FOR SOLAR. ENERGY THAT YOU THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS WE TRY TO GET RID OF GREENHOUSE GAS. BOB. GREENHOUSE GASES SO ME I'M IN RETAIL AND FOOD MAKES ME NERVOUS BECAUSE I JUST I DON'T. I DON'T SEE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE THE MOM AND POP HIRING. S. FELONS IN SOME OF THE CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. I LIKE TO THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO IN RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO THERE. THAT PRODUCTION. WE'LL WISE BOB WOULD CREATE THOSE JOBS. BUT I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT. I THINK IT IN AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE OF. OUR PAIN. OUR PAIN HIGHER URBAN BUFFET MUCH ABOVE THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE THOSE OF THE WINTER THE MANUFACTURERS ARE THE ONES. HOME WHO WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS CREDIT. BECAUSE HE OF REPAYMENT WAGE THIS CREDIT IS NOT AND PROBABLY HAVE BEEN. SO WHAT GOAL SHOULD THE STATE HIDING CREDIT CHIEF. AND THAT THE GOALS REALLY ARE TO ENCOURAGE THE HIRING OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO ARE HARD HIGHER I MEAN. YEAH I IS BASICALLY TO GET PEOPLE WHO. OF OUR LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED HAVE OTHER. HER PERSONAL HISTORY THAT THAT MAKE THEM HARD TO HIRE. TO BRING THEM INTO THE WORKFORCE. GIVE THEM. WORKING SO THAT THEY HAVE A RESUME AND MEN THAT THINK THEY CAN MOVE ON TO OTHER JOBS POTENTIALLY. THE CURRENT HIRING CREDIT WAS UNDER SUBSCRIBED SO WHY CREATING NEW CREDIT. WENT LIVE THE EXISTING CREDIT HIRING CREDIT EXPIRE OR REDIRECT THE FUNDING TO THEIR PROGRAM SUCH AS CALIFORNIA COMPETES. HOW WE REALLY FIT WLL I THINK THE GOALS OF THE TOUR DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS REALLY FOCUS ON BRINGING? A NEW JOBS TO CALIFORNIA O. WHERE IS THE HIRING CREDIT IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE EMPLOYEE BEING HIRED. A A AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS A. CHARACTERISTICS WHERE THEY MAKE THEM HARD TO HIGHER. SO I THINK. WE WE STILL BELIEVE THAT GOAL WITH WE THINK THOSE TWO GOALS ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO WHILE WE DO CERTAINLY SUPPORT CALIFORNIA COMPETES IN OUR IN OUR. PROPOSING TO EXPAND A TO EXTEND THAT. WE THINK THAT THE THE GOALS OF THE HIRING CREDIT ARE SEPARATE FROM THAT AND ARE WORTHY GOALS THAT. THAT. WE WANT TO REMOVE SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AROUND THAT TO ME TOO SO THAT WOULD BE MORE UTILIZED. THANK YOU. UPON OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT MANY WISHES BECAUSE THIS ITEM. KAEL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT RENAL THIS ITEM OPEN. WE WANT TO OUR NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT OUR STAFFING INCREASE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JUNIOR. FRANCHISE TALKSPORT. I'M TIFFANY LEASE FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.

AND AUDIT WORKLOADS AS WELL AS OUR EXISTING FUNDING LEVELS UP TO BE MAKES GREAT EFFORTS TO ENSURE OUR RESOURCES ARE UTILIZED TO JUST THE BEST TO ADDRESS NONCOMPLIANCE PROVIDE THE BEST VALUE FOR THE STATE AND ENSURE WE HAVE. AVOID ENGAGING AND UNNECESSARY AUDIT WORK WHICH IS BURDENSOME TO TAXPAYERS. THE STUDY SHOWED TO CRITICAL FACTORS BOTH OF WHICH ARE DRESSED IN THIS PEACEKEEPING. FIRST AFTER THE CONTINUES TO SEE INTERESTING WILL CREASING COMPLEXITY AND SOPHISTICATION AND THE WORKLOADS THAT WE PERFORM. AS A RESULT OF THIS INCREASED COMPLEXITY ATTRIBUTES A QUESTION TO PERMANENTLY INCREASE THE CLASSIFICATION LEVELS OF VARIOUS POSITIONS TO PROGRAM SPECIALIST TO AND PROGRAMS BUSLOADS THREE OUR HIGHEST AUDIT CLASSIFICATIONS. THIS WILL PROBABLY ALIGN EXISTING COMPLEX WORKLOADS WITH THE APPROPRIATE WORKING LEVEL AND SKILL LEVEL OF STAFF. OF TO BE HAS ALREADY DONE MANY OF THESE THREE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THE RESULT HAS GENERATED ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE ANNUALLY. OF TV IS STICKING FUNDING TO ALLOW THESE UPGRADES TO BE PERMANENT THAT STOPPING THE FUNDING REQUEST ASSOCIATED WITH A SIX FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE B. THREE P. REQUEST FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURAL FUNDING ISSUE. RELATED TO BASELINE FUNDING IN THAT APARTMENT HOUSE ACTUAL WAGES PAID.

HOWEVER THE REMAINDER TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT ARE FUNDED AT MIT STOP BUT TYPICALLY ARE THE LOWER CLASSIFICATIONS THE AUDITOR'S THE TALKS AUDITOR'S THE ASSOCIATE TAX AUDITORS AND THE PROGRAM'S POSSIBLES ONE POSITIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY OF TO BE FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS SPECIALIST THREES ARE ACTUALLY AT THE PIT STOP IN SPITE OF BEING FUNDED AT THE FIRST STOP. OF THE SALARY RANGE. AFTER BE IS SEEKING FUNDING FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE TOP STEP. FOR THIS PROVINCE BUSES THREE CLASSIFICATION FOR THE PROVINCE MUST WAS TO OF TO BE FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR STAFF WERE AT THE TOP PAY SCALE COMPARED TO THE FUNDING LEVEL AT THE FIRST STEP UP TO THE HOUSE. AFTER HE IS ASKING WITHIN THIS BCP TO SEEK FUNDING TO ALLOW FOR FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR PROVINCE BUSES TO BE FUNDED AT THE TOP STEP. THAT'S REQUESTED CLUB WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS POINT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE HONEST BCP THANK YOU OIL. YES SIR WE'RE NOT RAISING CONCERNS OF THE PROPOSAL BUT. AS DENOTED. MANY OF THE DECISIONS AT FTP WILL STILL BE FUNDED AT THE FIRST STEP. POEM FURTHER IT IT IS. NOT UNHEARD OF IT ALL BUT IT IS UNCOMMON U A LOT OF POSITIONS AT THE TOP STEP. I'M IN THIS CASE GIVEN THE SALARY LEVELS IT'S IT'S PROBABLY JUSTIFIED TO DO SO. SO WE'RE NOT RAISING. CONCERT AT THE PROPOSAL BUT WE WANT TO MAKE YOU WEAR THE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF. SOME OPTIONS HERE SO. YOU KNOW IF THE IDEA IS TO FREE UP FUNDING TO HIRE FILSON VACANCIES CREATES A MORE. DO MORE AUDITS AND CREATES MORE REVENUE. YOU COULD FUND THOSE POSITIONS AT THE MID STEP AND HIRE FEWER PEOPLE YOU COULD BRING OTHER POSITIONS FROM FIRST STEP UP TO MID STEP. OR YOU AND YOU KNOW IT A LARGER NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ARE SMALL IN NUMBER PLEASE AND ON. A VERY DOLLARS TO GET TO ABOUT THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT OR MORE LIST AND. WHAT WHAT THE GOALS ARE? FINANCE.

I HAVE TO BE IS ALSO ESTABLISH KEY PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS CYBER CRIMES WHICH HAS BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL BUT IN AND OF ITSELF SIR INSUFFICIENT TO OFFER AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL PROTECTION.
