DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF AGE SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS GENDER RACE RELIGION OR NATIONALITY AND THE DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES CAN LAST A LIFETIME ALTHOUGH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARDS PREVENTING AND ENDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES IMPORTANT WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED CALLS AND 7% OF ALL HOMICIDES WERE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED. THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER PROGRAM SERVES CLOSE TO NINETEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN SHELTERS AND SERVED ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH NON SHELTER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH PROVIDE ESSENTIAL LIFE SAVING SERVICES TO SURVIVORS THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE SHED LIGHT ON THE GREAT NEED FOR EDUCATION AND RAISING AWARENESS OF THE PREVALENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BY UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUALIZED NEEDS OF SURVIVORS THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WILL BE A TIME FOR CALIFORNIA'S DRUG KNOWLEDGE AND AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF SURVIVORS.

BUT SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. THESE NUMBERS HAVE SKYROCKETED WHILE MANY OF US WERE SHELTERING AT HOME TO STAY SAFE FROM THE PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HOME IS ANYWHERE BUT SAFE. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO DO AND I THINK THERE'S SUCH SO MANY COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- THOSE WHO LEARNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THIS FROM MY WIFE WHO IS A LEADING EXPERT IN THIS AREA- I. UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT JUST ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE IT'S ABOUT A CYCLE OF CONTROL AND ABUSE THAT BEGETS ITSELF. ON CREATES A VICIOUS CYCLE- I'M PROUD TO HAVE AUTHORED A NUMBER OF KEY- MESSICK VIOLENCE. MEASURES THIS YEAR INCLUDING ONE AT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR- I THINK WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO IN THIS SPACE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE THE LEAD HERE WE NEED TO PROTECT. FAMILIES CHILDREN FROM THE VEXING EFFECTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND SENATE COLLEAGUES TODAY I ALSO WRITE AND STRONG SUPPORT AND AS A PROBLEM JOIN AUTHOR ON S.

ALARMING AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALWAYS KEEP REMINDING THOSE THAT HAVE CHILDREN THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST PHYSICAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE TEND TO LOOK FOR PHYSICAL SIGNS OF ABUSE LET'S ALWAYS KEEP VERY VIGILANT AND LOOK FOR SIGNS OF CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TEENS IT IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE PERSONALITY THE WAY THEY DO THINGS ALWAYS ASK THE QUESTION NOT JUST ARE YOU BEING ASSAULTED BUT ARE YOU BEING COERCED AND THAT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REPEAT. I AM ALSO LET'S NOT BE AFRAID TO REPORT UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OR IF YOU SEE SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THAT MAY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR THAT PERSON THAT MAY BE ASSAULTED AND PLEASE CALL AND GET THEM HELP OUT WITH THAT I.

COLLEAGUES TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS AT SCHOOL AND IN THE WORKPLACE- IF A STUDENT DOES NOT HAVE AN UPDATED DIPLOMA OR TRANSCRIPT- THEY CAN FACE CHALLENGES APPLYING FOR GRAD SCHOOL OR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES- BECAUSE OF THAT DIPLOMA OR TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT MATCH WITH THEIR ACTUAL GENDER IDENTITY AND THE ACTUAL NAME- A COLLEGE DIPLOMA IS A REPRESENTATION OF YEARS OF HARD WORK AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IT SHOULD NOT CAUSE STRESS OR EMOTIONAL HARM BY HAVING SOMEONE'S BIRTH NAME OR DEAD NAME AS THE CALLER ON IT DUE TO OUTDATED DOTTED SCHOOL POLICIES EIGHTY TWO FORTY FIVE THOSE TWO THINGS FIRST IT ALLOWS TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY STUDENTS AT PUBLIC COLLEGES TO HAVE THEIR CHOSEN NAME PRINTED ON THEIR DIPLOMA WHEN THEY GRADUATE SECOND TO CREATE THE STANDARD PROCESS FOR UPDATING ITS STUDENTS RECORDS- AS FORMER STUDENTS.

SAID SENATOR LEHRER HE'S PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBR RAMIS AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE CAPITOL SOONER OR LATER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT OUR CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN FOR MANY THINGS ONE OF THEM BEING A RICH HISTORY AND DIVERSITY WELL THE HISTORY O OUR STATE CONTAINS PIECES OF INJUSTICES AND WRONGS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY IS ALSO ABOUT MOVEMENTS THAT FOUGHT FOR DEMANDED JUSTICE EQUITY AND CALLS. TO RIGHT THOSE WRONGS MANY OF US ON THIS FLOOR PARTICIPATED IN THOSE MOVEMENTS AND SOME OF US IT'S WHAT INSPIRED US TO GET INVOLVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE THE GOAL OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE EIGHT AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROM MOST IS TO UP LIFT ANOTHER DIVERSE VOICE AND EXPERIENCE. THE STATE CAPITOL ON CAPITOL GROUNDS SHOULD CONTAIN CELEBRATED MONUMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE BEST OF OUR STATE'S RICH HISTORY AND DIVERSITY. JUST LAST SUMMER THE STATUE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS AND QUEEN ISABELLA WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROTUNDA BECAUSE IT FELL SHORT OF THAT GOAL WELL THE STATUE MAY HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE BACK IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE IT WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA WE CELEBRATE TODAY. THIS BILL HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HAS BIPARTISAN CO AUTHORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS TODAY I HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND I HAVE TO- PROVIDE. UP LEAVE HIS PLANTATION WHY BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL- MAKE SOME REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE NOT ONLY. FALSE IT INCLUDES LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT IS NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE AND IT'S- I THINK IT POSES SOME. OF SOME X. OF REQUIREMENTS. OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ARE COMPLETELY UNACHIEVABLE BY ANYONE THAT WE HONOR IN OUR HISTORY I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY- WELL YOU KNOW WE TOOK AN ACTION AGAINST CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS AND I OFTEN ASK PEOPLE WHAT WAS CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS'S ACHIEVEMENT AND THEY SAY DOES HE DISCOVERED AMERICA AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER HE DID THAT BECAUSE AMERICA ALREADY EXISTED. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE IS RECOGNIZED FOR IN SCIENCE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DID NOT DISCOVER AMERICA WHAT HE DID WAS YOU RE UNITE HUMANITY. THAT WAS SEPARATED BY A GEOGRAPHY GEOGRAPHICAL CHANGE A CHANGE THAT SEPARATED PEOPLE THAT ONCE WERE ABLE TO CROSS OVER THE BERING STRAIT WHEN THE BRIDGE CREEK WAS ELIMINATED YOU HAD. A COMPLETELY NEW NEW CULTURES WERE FORMED THAT EXISTED IN AMERICA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. AND NATIVE AMERICANS BECAME A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE RANGING ALL OF THE AMERICAS SAID OF DEVELOPED IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC. DISCOVERIES INFORM NEW CULTURES BUT NEVER ONCE PART. OF THE HUMANITY THAT EXISTED IN IN AFRICA ASIA EUROPE AND THEN THEY WERE SEPARATED. THE SAILING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC BY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT HUMAN ACHIEVEMENTS IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE REUNITED HUMANITY SO WE WERE TAUGHT THAT IF YOU PUT IN A IF YOU SAY ON THE TEST THAT HE DISCOVERED AMERICA YOU GOT A N. A. AND ALL OF US WERE INDOCTRINATED TO SAY HE DISCOVERED AMERICA FALSELY WE GET IT WRONG BECAUSE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE AMERICAS THE NO OTHER PERSON IN HISTORY HAS MADE AND OF COURSE HE HAD HIS SINCE. HE HAD HIS SENTENCE AND OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT THEY HAD SINCE IN THE CASE OF COOPER OF SEVEN. COOPER SAID ABOUT IS BEING ACCUSED OF THINGS THAT HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO COOL WAS TWENTY PER CENT RACKLEY PERSONA DREAMED. OF THROUGH HIS ISHANT IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OF EIGHTEEN AND PEOPLE TO HIS RELIGION TO CREATING COMMUNITIES AND HE CAME HERE SPECIFICALLY FROM SPAIN THE MEXICO CITY AND HE HE WENT ON A VERY DIFFICULT JOURNEY. TO COME HERE TO CREATE COMMUNITIES THESE COMMUNITIES DID NOT INVOLVE SLAVERY PLEASE COMMUNITIES DID NOT INVOLVE TORTURE NOT NONE OF WHAT HE ENVISIONED WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THAT HE HAD THIS VISION OF COMING HERE AND CREATE CREATING THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD WORSHIP HIS GOD THAT IS SO MUCH IN TUNE WITH OUR OWN VALUES AS A PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY AND IF YOU LOOK AT. OF OUR HISTORY THAT'S VERY MUCH OF WHAT A LOT OF US BELIEVE A LOT OF US TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO JOIN OUR TEAM OUR PARTY. OUR OUR GROUP IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT HUMAN BEINGS DOING DO OVER OR THERE IS NO COUNTRY THERE'S NO SOCIETY THERE'S NO GROUP THAT USED WAR OR CONFLICT AS A MEANS OF NOT ONLY PROTECTING THEMSELVES FOR ADVANCING THEIR GOALS NOTHING IN IN IN AMERICA. IT'S FREE FROM THAT OUR HISTORY IS ABOUT WAR. IT'S ABOUT CONFLICT IN SOME OF OUR BIGGEST HEROES OUR OUR OUR OUR FIGURES ARE HISTORICAL FIGURES THAT WERE SOLDIERS THAT WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL THAT'S NOT REALLY A FEW MORE OIL IS DOWN TO ITS MAKING WAR CONFLICT AND pSUCCESSFUL COUNTRIES AND THAT IS AND WE STILL POSSESS THE LARGEST MILITARY IN WORLD HISTORY THOSE ARE STILL. OUR VALUES AS A COUNTRY WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT MAKES US THE WORLD POWER THAT WE ARE IN SO OUR HISTORY. IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS PARTICIPATED IN THAT IS CONTRIBUTED IN MAKING WHO WE ARE SO WHY IN PARTICULAR SCRUTINY SPECIAL SET OF IT BEING PUNISHED. HE'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WHO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR NATIVE AMERICANS AND PUT LAWS IN PLACE TO PROTECT NATIVE AMERICANS SO WHY IS HE BEEN ACCUSED ACTUALLY OF. HER NAME VIOLATING INSULATING NATIVE AMERICANS THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE HE DID NONE OF THAT. ONE OF THE LAWS THAT HE PUT INTO PLACE REQUIRED THE REMOVAL OF THE ACTING GOVERNOR AT THE TIME WHO WAS WHO WAS HARMING NATIVE AMERICANS SAID HE DISAGREED WITH THAT AND THE ONLY WAY HE THOUGHT HE COULD PROTECTED OF AMERICANS WAS TO REMOVE THAT FIGURE WHICH IS SUCCESSFULLY DID THE NEXT THING THAT HE ADVOCATED FOR WAS THAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS. ACTUALLY BE ALLOWED TO INTEGRATE INTO COMMUNITIES AND EVENTUALLY ON LAND THAT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING THAT WE ALLOW TO DIE BUT HE DID MET NUMEROUS THINGS TO ADVOCATE FOR NATIVE AMERICANS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE'S ACCUSED OF IN A COMMENT HE MENTIONED SHACKLES OF PUTTING PEOPLE IN SHACKLES BECAUSE BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE JAILS OR PRISONS AND HE WAS MAKING A COMMENT TOWER UP HOLDING THE LAW AND ANYBODY THAT BROKE IT. INCLUDING NATIVE AMERICANS SHOULD BE SHACKLED BUT THAT WAS VERY MUCH IN TUNE WITH OUR VALUES TODAY WE BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER WE BELIEVE IN MAKING LAWS AND IF ANYBODY DOESN'T RESPECT THEM THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND HE WAS CREATING A SOCIETY OF ORDERS WILL AS HE SOUGHT SO HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN OUR HISTORY AT CREATING COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE PERSISTED THAT NOW CREATED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CITIES IN THE WORLD AND TO OUR STATE. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ADDITIONAL CITIES LIKE MON MODERATE IMPORTANT CITIES C. R. THESE ARE IMPORTANT COMMUNITIES BUT HAVE A FOUNDATION IN SOMETHING THAT HE STARTED. BUT DID NOT BUILD A LONG NONE OF THIS HE DID A LOT AND NONE OF THIS WAS ENTIRELY AS HE ENVISIONED BUT NATIVE AMERICANS WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO ANYTHING HE DID THEY WOULD NOT BEEN A SINGLE COMMUNITY BUILT IF IT WASN'T. FOR THE INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND THAT IS OFTEN MIS CHARACTERIZED SAYING THAT HE HELD A GUN TO THEIR HEAD AND SAID YOU MUST DO SOMETHING THAT IT'S- NOT ACCURATE EVERY TIME NATIVE AMERICANS IN A MISSION COMMUNITY WERE MISTREATED. THEY REBELLED AND THEY BURNT DOWN THE MISSIONS THEY THEY ENDED MANY MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA FROM ARE FROM CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY TO BACK ON THE PHONE A LOT WERE NATE DIDN'T END IT BECAUSE THE NATIVE AMERICANS REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE. AND THEY ACTUALLY MADE WAR AGAINST THE SETTLERS AND THEY KILL THEM AND A LOT OF THOSE MISSIONS FAILED IN IN IN SAN DIEGO A MISSION THAT- SO FAR- NOW ST CRITICAL SET UP FUND IT IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE THAT WAS ENOUGH OPERATING IN IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR. THAT LED TO THE KILLING OF SOME PRIESTS WERE THERE. AND THE BURNING OF THE MISSION AND CAN BETTER COOPER SAID I HAD TO TRAVEL FROM MONTEREY BACK TO SAN DIEGO BUT THEN IMAGINE TRAVELING DOWN THERE WAS A VERY DIFFICULT THING. AND WHEN HE WENT BACK THE MISSION WAS RE ESTABLISHED NOT BY FORCE NOT BY MILITARY POWER. BECAUSE NATIVE AMERICANS RESPECTED HIM AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING. LED TO THAT THAT WAS CORRECTED AND SO THESE COMMUNITIES WOULD HAVE NOT ASSISTED IF IT HAD BEEN FOR THE USE OF SLAVERY IN MILITARY MIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE STRENGTH AND THE POWER THAT NATIVE AMERICANS HAD THEY WERE VERY LARGE COMMUNITIES MADE UP OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE THEMSELVES AMAZING WARRIORS NATIVE AMERICANS WERE INCREDIBLE WARRIORS OFTEN FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES AND OFTEN EVEN ENSLAVED OTHER TRIBES SLAVERY WAS A THING OF THE DAY AND I NEED TO SPEAK TO SLAVERY BECAUSE SLAVERY IN THIS BILL IS GROSSLY GROSSLY MISREPRESENTED BECAUSE WHAT IT MAKES REFERENCE TO A LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY THE KING IN THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS THAT OUTLAWED SLAVERY AND THE OUTLAWED THE SLAVERY OF NATIVE AMERICANS IT FILLS OUT LOUD BUT HOW COULD THEY ENGAGE IN AND WHO NEED MENTAL SET ALSO. DID NOT SUPPORT SLAVERY IN FACT. SLAVERY WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY. IN IN PUT IT INTO LAW IN MEXICO WAS ACTUALLY OUTLAWED. IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE BECAUSE SLAVERY BEGAN TO BE INTRODUCED INTO MEXICAN TERRITORY THROUGH TEXAS. ONE EIGHT OUTLAWED SLAVERY THAT CREATED THE CONFLICT THAT MADE- TEXAS SEPARATE FROM MEXICO BACK IN THE THIRTIES AND IT BLED IT WAS ALL A DIRECT RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF SLAVERY IN MEXICO SO IN IN ADDITION TO THAT SLAVERY WAS NOT ALLOWED IN IN IN- CALIFORNIA THINGS WILL IT REALLY WENT WRONG IN CALIFORNIA IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WHEN CALIFORNIA BECAME A STATE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE FIRST LAW THE PAST WAS A LAW THAT ALLOWED THE SLAVE AND SLAVE MINUTES OF NATIVE AMERICANS THROUGH A LAW THAT ALLOWED- CALIFORNIANS TO KILL NATIVE AMERICANS AND TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN. AND TO INDENTURE ANY NON NATIVE AMERICAN BASIS ALL IS NOT GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AND THAT WAS A FORM OF SLAVERY THAT WAS ALLOWED BACK THEN BIG GAVE RISE. TO THE EXTERMINATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS THE REAL PROBLEMS BEGAN IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS IF THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS THE REAL ONE STARTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY. AND THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WE HONOR TODAY IN OUR STATE GROUNDS AND IN OTHER PLACES THAT TOOK A HAND IN INSULATING THE INDIANS IN MISTREATING THEM AND KILLING AN ACTUAL GENOCIDE LOVE IN FACT WE HAVE A THE ENTIRE WHOLE RECOGNIZING GOVERNORS THAT PASSED LAWS IN THIS VERY BUILDING AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS I DON'T SEE US REMOVING THEIR NAMES I DON'T SEE US REMOVING THEM FROM THE GROUNDS I DON'T SEE US BOB- TEARING DOWN THIS BUILDING WHICH IS AS MUCH A SYMBOL OF COLONIZATION IS ANYTHING ELSE INCLUDING WHAT WE DO AS A GOVERNMENT I AM VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING THIS PROCESS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW GROWING UP AS A LATINO IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S HARD TO FIND HISTORICAL FIGURES THAT MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR SOCIETY THAT COME FROM MY HERITAGE FOR MY BACKGROUND. THAT PART OF NATIVE AMERICAN DESCENT. OF SPANISH DESCENT OR MEXICAN DESCENT MOSTLY OUR HISTORY IS VILIFIED THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROWING UP IN THE STATE WITHOUT HEROES FOR A PUBLIC FIGURES TO LEARN FROM AN ASPIRE TO AND LEARN THAT IN THE STATE THAT I WAS BORN IN THEY WERE. LATINOS AND- ITS PARTNERS MAKING HISTORY HERE. LONG BEFORE I WAS BORN DATING BACK. MAKING HISTORY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT NONE OF THEM ARE REFLECTED WHEN WE FINALLY GOT ONE THIS MONUMENT THAT WILL BE REMOVED TO PUT IT BUT ARE SET ON THE GROUNDS AND HOW DO I KNOW. IT WILL BE REMOVED BECAUSE I GOT CONFIRMATION FROM THE AUTHOR THE IT WILL BE REMOVED. AND THIS BASICALLY BILL SETS UP THE PROCESS TO REMOVE. A MONUMENT THAT IS NOT A HISTORICAL ALL OF THE HISTORICAL VALUE AND PROTECTED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAWS THIS BILL DOES NOT AT ALL MAKE MENTION OF THE FACT THAT THAT IS A HISTORICAL SITE. AND IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED BUT IT PUTS IT ON THE PATH TO BE REMOVED THEY'RE REMOVING STARKEL FIGURE THAT IS OF SPANISH HERITAGE THE ONLY ONE THAT WE HAVE. AND REPLACING IT WITH A MONUMENT TO NATIVE AMERICANS WHICH I BELIEVE IS A HAVING A MONUMENT TO A NATIVE AMERICANS I THINK IS ESSENTIAL BUT BUILDING IT ON A HISTORICAL SITE OF HONOR SOMEBODY THAT MADE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR STATE IS A HUGE MISTAKE CREATING A SCAR YOU'RE CREATING AN EMOTIONAL SCAR AND ON THAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT ANOTHER MONUMENT THAT. HONORS A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE I AM BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND SPANISH DESCENT AND I'M VERY PROUD OF BOTH MY NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE AND MY SPANISH MEXICAN HERITAGE AND THIS BILL MAKES ME CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE OR THE OTHER AND ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OF SPANISH DESCENT AND NATIVE AMERICAN SAID IT DOES THE VERY SAME THING THE AUTHOR HIMSELF IS OF SPANISH DESCENT AN UPDATE OF AMERICANS SAID HIS NAME ROMMEL SAYS A SPANISH NAME HIS TRIBE SOMEONE WHEN SOMEONE WILL IS AS THE NAME OF HIS ST SPANISH NAME AND HE IS OF THE SERVER I KNOW PEOPLE A NAME GIVEN TO THEM BY THE SPANISH CALIFORNIA IT IS A PLACE OF DIVERSE CITY ALL OF US HERE SHOULD CELEBRATE EACH OTHER AND ALTHOUGH THE FIGURES GEORGE WASHINGTON FOUGHT AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS HE KILLED NATIVE AMERICANS AND HE OWNED SLAVES BUT THE CONTROVERSIAL TEENAGER ACTUALLY TO SPEAK TO THE MEASURE I AM OKAY AND THAT IS RELEVANT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ACTING TO REMOVE ANYONE THAT IS OF ENGLISH DESCENT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ITALIAN WHEN IT COMES TO SPANISH THAT IS LOW HANGING FRUIT IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS IS WHERE I CAN NOT PARTICIPATE IN DIMINISHING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PEOPLE FROM MY COMMUNITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ADHERE. TO ONE GROUPS. THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A NOTABLE PERSONALITY IN HISTORY YET COMPLETELY IGNORES COMPLETELY IGNORES EVERYONE ELSE BUT WE HONOR THAT HAVE SINCE SO I KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE REMOVED BECAUSE I TRIED TO WORK THIS OUT WITH THE AUTHOR AND INITIALLY THERE WAS AN INTENT. THAT WE WERE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK THIS OVER. BUT I KNEW THAT WHEN I FIRST GOT A LETTER SAYING I WILL SCHEDULE A MEETING FOLLOWED BY A LETTER SAYING I'VE DECIDED THE MEETING WILL BE ON THIS DATE IN THIS TIME PLEASE CALL MY OFFICE TO CONFIRM WHEN I TRIED TO CALL HIS OFFICE. TO SET THE DATE AND TIME AND TO INCLUDE. OTHER LEADERS OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY COMPLETELY REFUSED HE HAD THERE WOULD BE NO RIGHT YOU CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS IF POSSIBLE I WILL. AND AT THE VERY END HE HE SENT ME A LETTER SAYING THAT I'M WRITING TO INFORM YOU THAT MY OFFICE WILL BE REACHING WITH THAT I I'M SORRY. I HE BASICALLY SAID I HAVE HONORED OUR ARTICLE GREENMAN TO PARTICIPATE IN A MEETING WITH YOU AND THE SPONSORING TRIBAL LEADERS THIS FULFILLS MY PROMISE I HAVE A THE SPONSORS TRIBE HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE EIGHTY THREE THREE THREE EIGHT IN ITS CURRENT FORM A MEETING THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE LETTERS BE SENT TO HAVE A MEETING BUT THAT WAS. THE WAY THIS WENT DOWN. WITHOUT NO ABILITY TO PROVIDE INPUT I THIS IS WHY I FEEL VERY SAD THIS IS SAD DAY FOR ME HAVING TO WITNESS. I KIND OF FEEL THIS IS AN ATTACK ON MY COMMUNITY POLICE ON HALF OF MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE OTHER HALF WANTS TO SEE A MONUMENT. AND THE OTHER HALF WANTS TO CONTINUE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS WE'VE MADE IN HISTORY AND FOR THAT I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS IT DESERVES YOUR SUPPORT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WORK THIS OUT AND CREATE A MNUMENT TO BOTH OR AT LEAST ALLOW US TO WORK SOMETHING OUT. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WITH HISTORY AND ALSO. PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS PEOPLE OF MADE FOR HISTORY THAT DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED. I ASKED YOU TO JOIN ME IN VOTING NO AGAIN IT'S A B. THREE THREE EIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH THE FULL BODY SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED IN SENATE GOP. COMMITTEE REGARDING- AB THREE THIRTY EIGHT MANY OF US. ARE LAID OFF ON THE VOTE ON THAT ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY OR MAYBE I SHOULD SPEAK FOR MYSELF I LAID OFF. ON THE VOTE THAT DAY WANTING TO SUPPORT A B. THREE THIRTY EIGHT. AND I THINK IN THAT- THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT WE COULD CONSIDER HERE AND SEVERAL OF US ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER. AMENDING THE BILL. TO MAINTAIN IN THE HOOD OF HER SERRA- MONUMENT HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT ADD TO THE CAPITOL GROUNDS OF PROPER- HONOR. AT TO THE NATIVE AMERICANS THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND- HAVE. OCCUPIED CALIFORNIA BEFORE EUROPEANS GOT HERE AND YOU KNOW JUST PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THAT'S A SIMPLE REQUESTED- SOME OF US HAVE MADE THAT I WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE HONORED. I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH I THINK WE CAN. HONOR BOTH THE HERITAGE OF AN APPARENT SERRA. AND THE HERITAGE OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN- RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THEY WERE HERE BEFORE ANY OF US WERE. AND SO I WAS HOPING THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD GET TO WE DIDN'T AND SO- I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE BODY THANK YOU THINK CENTRE JOAN SENATOR ALSO YES SIR HEY DIDN'T INTEND TO GET UP TO SPEED BUT I THINK THAT- SENATOR WESSEL RAISES SOME VERY IMPORTANT AND LEGITIMATE ISSUES HERE AND CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE EXACT EXACT THIS IS THE EXACT CASE IN WHICH I COULD REALLY FIGHT FOR AW- THE INCLUSION OF ALL WHEN YOU GET A NEW BETTER SANTA TOO MANY TOO MANY CONFLICTING AND SOME VERY VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY E SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE HERE AT THE CAPITOL MANY NOT JUST ONE OR TWO. AW I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT SENATOR WESSEL SAID SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO IS THAT THERE IS A PART OF HISTORY THAT'S GOING TO BE TOLD THROUGH THE STATUTE OF A OF A NATIVE AMERICAN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ARE DEDICATED TO THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT THERE IS AS THE SENATOR SAID ANOTHER PART A SIGNIFICANT PART WHICH IS THE ROLE OF MEXICANS IN THIS STATE AND THAT. IS NOT BEING TAKEN APPEAR AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT WE JUST UNDER THE CENSUS KNOW THAT. LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST GROUP HERE IN THE STATE SO THERE'S MANY MANY THINGS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL THOSE CONCERNS AND ALL THOSE ISUES- BUT WE DO NEED TO DO THAT INSTEAD OF PITTING. ONE GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER SO WHY WHY WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL I AGREE IN SO MANY WAYS WITH THE SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO SAID AND WE HAVE TO FIX IT AND WE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN MEMBERS- VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION I DO WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR- HIS EXPOSITION AND ALL THE INTERESTING THINGS HE HAD TO SAY I AGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE AND INTENT LANGUAGE HERE THAT I THINK GOES A LITTLE FAR I THINK THAT- PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT FATHER SET EYES. BASICALLY AND A SYMBOL OF THE ENTIRE OUR MISSION SYSTEM AND ALL OF ITS EXCESSES- BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF WHY HE WAS COMMEMORATED IN THE FIRST PLACE- LIKE SO MANY I MEAN THE AND WE TALKED ABOUT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN MANY RESPECTS HE IS. CELEBRATED WERE VILIFIED BECAUSE HE'S A SYMBOL IS A SYMBOL OF. OF NOT ONLY THE DISCOVERY BUT THE ULTIMATE COLONIZATION ALL THE PAIN AND HARDSHIP THAT WAS INCURRED- I GUESS I HEARD WHAT I I'M CERTAINLY DISTURBED HERE THE- THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND OUR COLLEAGUE THAT'S REALLY DOES CONCERN ME I THAT WAS THE EXPECTATION COMING OUT OF JAIL COMMITTEE- I WILL SAY THAT I I'M NOT SURE THAT I AGREE WITH THE SENATORS CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS PARTICULAR CITED HISTORICAL SITE. OF THE STATUE WENT UPIN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN- YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST I I'VE I WENT SAW THAT STATUE MANY TIMES DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO HAVE PARTICULAR AESTHETIC MERIT HI. THERE'S NO THERE'S NOTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THE SITE- WITH HISTORIC HISTORY WITH HISTORIC- A STORY OF FATHER SAT OUT THE MISSION SYSTEM I JUST HAPPEN TO BE A SITE THAT WAS CHOSEN ON OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS. ARE THERE STILL MANY ALLUSIONS TO THE MISSION SYSTEM HERE IN THIS BUILDING OUR FATHER SERRA'S NAME- IS MENTIONED ON SOME MURALS- IT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT TAKING DOWN HIS STATUE AT CARMEL WHICH OF COURSE IS A SITE THAT'S VERY MUCH CONNECTED WITH HIS LEGACY IN A STORY- SO YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS THAT. THIS IS NOT A IT'S SPECIAL PLAY THEY WERE ABOUT WITH REGARD TO. A SARIN HIS LEGACY AND LET'S ALSO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE STATUE IS NO LONGER STANDING THE QUESTION HERE IS- IS NOT WHETHER IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING DOWN A STATUE- IT'S ABOUT WHETHER TO PUT IT BACK UP AGAIN OR INSTEAD. TO PUT A MONUMENT- REFLECTING THE INCREDIBLE HERITAGE OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY I'VE NOW IT'S TRUE THE MINUTE WAS TORN DOWN TORN DOWN BY- THE PEOPLE WHO WERE VANDALISING. OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION AS WELL BUT I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS SITE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. TO OUR TO THE HISTORY- THAT A YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE A GREAT NEED OF AMERICAN- MONUMENT HERE ON THE SITE I FELT COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL. IN COMMITTEE- I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THOUGH I WILL SAY I'M NOT ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THE LANGUAGE IN THE INTENT. OF THE BILL AND ALSO I'M CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND ARE CALLING AND I HOPE. THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES OUT OF AFTER THE SENATE FLOOR AND SOME OF THESE. CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED WE CAN GET SOME CLARITY FROM THE OTHERS OFFICE SOME MORE DIALOGUE BETWEEN OUR COLLEAGUES SO AS TO GET AT LEAST SOME OF THESE ISSUES- THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TO DRESS I HADN'T. SO THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS. ON ON THIS BILL THEY RE AND ANNA AND I AND I DO WANT TO COMMEND. OUR COLLEAGUES FOR- FOR HIS PASSIONATE AND WHARTON DISCUSSION- AND THE POINTS THAT HE RAISED WITH REGARDS TO WHO IS CELEBRATED WHO ISN'T THERE SOME FASCINATING DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING RIGHT DOWN IN NEW MEXICO OVER SOME SOME OF SIMILAR TYPES OF ISSUES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH COLONIZATION TENSION BETWEEN. LATINO COMMUNITY AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES LOOKS BACK- AND AS AND AS MUCH AS OUR COLLEAGUE SAID SO OFTEN THOSE TWO COMMUNITIES ARE SO INEXORABLY INTERTWINED THAT IT LEADS TO SOME VERY DIFFICULT AND FASCINATING ISSUES WITH THE RELATION TO IDENTITY AND HISTORY THANK THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- HI FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO RECOGNIZE VERY ELOQUENT OF TRIP DOWN NOT HISTORY LANE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO IT WAS QUITE AMAZING TEETH TO BE REMINDED OF THE MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT WERE NOT ACCURATE AS WE TRAVEL THROUGH THE EDUCATION OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY TRUE. WHAT'S TROUBLING TO ME- IN THE CURRENT FORM THE MEASURE MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO HELP UNITE PEOPLE OF CONSTRUCTING- YEAH WELL TO TRIBAL NATIONS IN SACRAMENTO TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN A MONUMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PEOPLE OF THE REGION ON THE GROUNDS OF THE STATE CAPITOL THAT IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING. AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES NOT ALLOW US TO RESTORE- D. V. ST UNIT PEARL SERRA MONUMENT ON THE GROUNDS OF THE CAPITOL WHICH WERE ILLEGALLY REMOVED- THROUGH WRITING SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE FIVE IF WE HOLD ON THIS BILL WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME LEFT IN THE SESSION TO HAVE SOME SORT OF MODIFICATION THAT DOES ALLOW THE RESTORATION OF THE UNIVERSAL SERRA A MONUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SET ASIDE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR CAPITAL GROUNDS. TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREDIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT IS OUR OUR DUTY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THEY HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING ALL OF CALIFORNIANS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE- WE ARE ONE PEOPLE AND TO BEGIN TO DIVIDE OURSELVES OVER YOU KNOW THE FLAWS OF OUR ANCESTORS AND OUR FOUNDERS OF SUNDAY WILL ALL BE JUDGED ON THAT ALSO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR ALL OF US. TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT FOR BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE JUST ALLOW A LITTLE MORE TIME AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING OUT FORAGING. HAVING US ALL DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO OUR OR- ARE OUR THOUGHTS BUT TE PASS FOR AND THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR WITHOUT I'D ASK THAT WE JUST PUT IT OVER. TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT AND BRING IT BACK IN A DIFFERENT FORM THANK YOU. THANKS INTERVIEWED SENATOR BORDERS. IS THIS WORK NOW HERE WE GO WELL. MR PRESIDENT MAY- MAY PLEASE- POSE A QUESTION TO THE FOUR SPONSOR OF THE BILL EARLIER WOULD YOU TO QUESTION SURE SHOOT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CALIFORNIA I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A PRESERVATIONIST COMMISSION OR MONUMENTS COMMISSION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT STILL IN EXISTENCE- BUT- WOULD THIS NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE. ISSUE TO PRESENT TO THAT COMMISSION MADE UP OF FOLKS WHO ARE WELL SCHOOLED AND DISCIPLINED IN- IN HISTORY AND MONUMENTS FOR US TO GIVE A BETTER SENSE ON. WE'VE HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT THE AESTHETIC VALUE OR QUESTION THE ASCETIC VALUE IN HISTORICAL VALUE WAS THIS IS THE ISSUE EVER BROUGHT TO THE COMMISSION NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BUT I CAN TELL YOU HAS BEEN A PRIOR SECRETARYSHIP THAT COMMISSION WAS IN A DEPARTMENT THAT WAS IN MY AGENCY AND IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF ITS AUTHORITY WITH WHAT REGARD DO YOU DESCRIBE. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY ABOUT HISTORIC PRESERVATION OF BUILDINGS OR OTHER ITEMS AND IT MIGHT TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THOSE BUILDINGS BUT- THIS WOULD NOT. FALL WITHIN IT ADDITIONALLY THE CAPITAL IS ALWAYS UNIQUE AND THE CAPITOL GROUNDS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONSIDERING THIS I WAS GOING TO MENTION IN MY CLOTHES SO ONE OF THE FIVE THIS IS DIFFERENT MAN PORTRAITS OF GOVERNORS OR EVEN A FAN OF THE CARMEL MISSION. BECAUSE THIS WAS ENACTED BY LAW AND ALL THIS DOES IS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THIS ALL IT DOES IS JUST REPEAL THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A STATUTE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THOSE GOVERNORS PORTRAITS. OF THE CARMEL STATUE IS ON PRIVATE LAND OUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL SO IT WOULD BE NOT WITHIN I THINK THE PURVIEW OF THAT COMMISSION AND HOW THEY'RE STRUCTURED IS THERE ANOTHER BODY WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO REVIEW A MATTER LIKE THIS IN CURA MEMBER OF STAFF ONE BODY. BECAUSE BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEGISLATURE THAT REQUIRED THE STATUE BY LAW IT IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN DEAL WITH IT AND IT'S A LEGISLATURE THAT THAT SORT OF HAS CONTROL OVER THE CAPITOL GROUNDS OKAY BUT THENOUTSIDE OF. THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S NO OTHER NOT DIRECT MISSION TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET MY UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE THAT THERE WAS. A STATE MONUMENTS COMMISSION AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S STILL STANDING CURRENTLY. THANK YOU I THANK YOU SENATOR GROW. S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE FATHER HAD A PAIR OF SERRA WAS AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SPANISH FRANCISCAN WHO WAS A CO FOUNDER OF OUR STATE AND BROUGHT CHRISTIANITY TO CALIFORNIA- MANY MISSIONS AS IT'S BEEN STATED- ARE BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE MISSIONS WERE AN ESTABLISHED ESPECIALLY OVER IN THE COASTAL REGION REGION AND HE'S REASON THAT SO MANY TOWNS BEER- THE NAME OF ST INCLUDING CITY OF ANGELS LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SAN RAPHAEL IN SAN DIEGO JUST TO NAME A FEW ALTHOUGH I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CONSTRUCTING A MONUMENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR NATIVE AMERICANS AND THAT- WE'RE HERE. IN THE STATE IN THE NATION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THIS COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE. I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN C. AND T. DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T BE TO. A ONE THAT HONORS- JUNIPERO SERRA. SERRA AND THEN ALSO OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO'S COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE HISTORY LESSON THAT HE GAVE HIM THAT HE GAVE ALL OF US. YOU KNOW- BECAUSE OUR HISTORY ISN'T PERFECT. BUT IT'S OURS. AND ERASING IT AND SIMPLY ERASING IT DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY. AT ALL AND I THINK M. RECOGNIZING WHAT OUR HISTORY IS IN THE STATE IN THIS NATION WILL HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES IN THE PAST. SO EVEN THOUGH I pKNOW IT'S I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR MEASURES DURING YOUR CARRYING THIS AND FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMEAU'S. IS THERE SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE OR TO MIMIC CAN BE TAKEN TO HONOR BOTH. OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ON OUR CAP IN THESE GROUPS. THE INDIVIDUAL JUNIPER SERRA AND THEN THE GROUPS AND THE NEED AMERICANS ON OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS. AND I THINK YOU SORRY QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR APOLOGIZE SIR SOONER WE TOOK HER LESSON YES AND ACTUALLY THE QUESTION WAS ALREADY OFFERED. A SO LET ME SAY ONCE AGAIN MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THIS BILL JUST RECALL PEELS THE REQUIREMENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE STATUTE. LEAVES OPEN A DISCUSSION SUCH AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN THOUGH IT PROACTIVELY SETS UP A PROCESS. TO HAVE A STATUTE. THAT ARE OWNERS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE SO IT LEAVES THAT OPEN BUT IT CLEARLY RECALL OF. A REPEALS THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT THE WE HAVE THE STAFF TO WHOM THE PEROT SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM IN NINETEEN NINE CENTER ALERT WHICH ARTICLES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LET ME THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A IT'S A REAL TRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS O HAPPEN AND IN FACT HAPPENED HERE TODAY IN MANY WAYS. AND ERR ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL I JUST REPEAT ORDER I HAVE SAID TO TWO QUESTIONS THE BILL REPEALS THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATUE AND SETS UP A PROCESS FOR A STATUE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT THE TOUGH THING. IS SOME OF THE FACTS ABOUT HISTORY ARE IN DISPUTE- THE FATHER SIR WAS CRITICIZED BY SPANISH GOVERNORS AND OTHER EUROPEAN OBSERVERS AT THE TIME AND THERE IS A BOOK BY THE PULITZER NOMINATED AUTHOR AFFILIATE DISCUSS DO THAT REALLY DOCUMENTS THE THINGS THAT THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT THIS. SUBJECT AND IT IT ALSO IN THE DIFFICULTY OF THE DISCUSSION I MEAN POPE FRANCIS CAME TO SOUTH AMERICA AND APOLOGIZED TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES FOR THE GRAVE SINS OF COLONIALISM. AND SO I THINK THAT IT WAS ALSO OFFERED ON THE FLOOR THAT ARE MONUMENTS AND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTED REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS A CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED AND THAT ALL OF US HAVE TO TAKE IT UPON HERSELF TO CONTINUE THAT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS AND THEN I THINK THAT WAS SET ON THE FLOOR NOT. A GOOD THING SO- THE ONE LAST THING I'D SAY IS IT'S INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT AND THE OPPOSITION. THE SUPPORT IT IS REALLY FIFTEEN TRIBES WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IS THEIR VOICE THAT'S SPEAKING TO WHAT THEIR VIEW OF HISTORY YES AND IT IS IMPORTANT. TO HEAR THAT FORCE BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE IT AND DIVERSITY OF MONUMENTS IS LISTENING TO THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLES OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT IS WHAT IS BEING SPOKEN TO. IN THIS BILL IT GOT OFF THE ASSEMBLY FOR SIXTY SIX TO TWO THE PAST GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION TWELVE TO ZERO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE OH SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS SOONER MEN. HEY MR PRESIDENT EIGHTY FIVE OH SIX WOULD REQUIRE YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT SPECIFIED CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MEASURES. IN RECENT YEARS INCREASED STATURE LIMITATIONS AND MEDIA ATTENTION HAVE HEIGHTENED OUR AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE IN SCHOOLS CHURCHES SPORTS TEAMS AND YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE OVER NINETY THOUSAND CLAIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA. EVIDENCE SHOWING INTERNAL FILES TRACKING THE IDENTITIES ANDCRIMES OF HUNDREDS OF PERPETRATORS OR SCOUT LEADERS. OR OTHER ADULT VOLUNTEERS HOWEVER SUCCESS SUSPECTED ABUSE WITHIN THE BOY SCOUTS WAS OFTEN NOT REPORTED TO POLICE. AND ORGANIZATION CONTINUALLY FAIL TO TAKE MORE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES SIMILARLY OVER TWO HUNDRED CLAIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE WERE FILED AGAINST THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. WHICH FAILED TO REPORT ABUSE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN SOME CASES FAIL TO RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS. ON STAFF. DESPITE INTERNAL POLICIES TO THE CONTRARY WHILE MANY YOUTH ORGANISER HAVE ADOPTED GOOD INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES THEY'RE STILL LACK OF UNIFORM STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY EIGHTY FIVE OH SIX WOULD CREATE BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS. TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE AND YOU SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND REQUIRE TRAINING ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING FOR MINISTRY- SIMPLE REASON REGULAR VOLUNTEERS. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHILD ABUSE ABUSE PREVENTION POLICIES SUCH AS HAVING TO MANDATED REPORTERS PRESENT WHEN IN CONTACT WITH CHILDREN TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE S. A FORMER BOY pFATHER OF YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE CUB SCOUTS I THINK THESE ARE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SAFE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE BEST OF THE VALUES THAT THESE TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS OFFER. WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE DOWNSIDE RISK OF PREDATORS IN. THIS BILL PASSED SENATE COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AND RECEIPT HAS RECEIVED NO NO VOTES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.
