GOVERNORS. IS ONE POINT SEVEN-

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:26.065
IN ALTHOUGH THIS RECOMMENDATION

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.779
CONSIDERATION YOU ALL SHOULD BE

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:41.647
THINKING ABOUT IT YOU'RE

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.915
PUTTING THESE TOGETHER REALLY

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.216
JUST WHAT IS THE CAPACITY OF

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.418
DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.786

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.655
INFLUX OF FUNDING AT AT ONE

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.157
TIME SO. I THINK THINKING ABOUT

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.059
SPREADING IT IN A WAY THAT-

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:57.229
THAT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.564
STATE GOVERNMENT FRANKLY CAN

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:01.634
ACCOMMODATE AS IT IS AN

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.501
APPROACH THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.103
AND THEN ALTHOUGH WE WERE NOT

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.871
HAVING A DISCUSSION ON THE TAX

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.273
PACKAGE COULD YOU COMMENT ON

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:08.607
THAT BECAUSE- THE STAFF

RECOMMENDATION IS TO- USE A

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:13.812

THE FINAL AGREEMENT WILL BE THE

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.793
SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY-

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.896
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.231
SOME THINGS THAT ARE. MIGHT BE

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:33.632
IN THE CLIMATE PACKAGE THAT

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.334

THE IN THE ACT PACKAGE. HE I

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.738

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.307
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU WELL

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:43.976
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED BUT TO

SIMILAR. TYPE ACTIVITIES SO

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.217
EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES IT HARDER

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:53.686
THESE AREN'T STANDALONE

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.421
PACKAGES THAT JUST KIND OF GO

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:57.623
OFF AND GET IMPLEMENTED-

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.525
INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT THAT

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.926
INTERACTION OUR PRIORITIES OF

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.227

ADDITION TO THESE THREE AS WELL

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.566
AS IT IS THAT DISASTER

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.101
PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES THAT

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.502
ARE- BEING CONSIDERED THROUGH

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:11.770
THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.205
SERVICES REALLY THINKING.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.740
HOLISTICALLY ABOUT WHAT ARE ALL

SURE THAT THE STATE

ACCOMPLISHES WITH THIS- REALLY

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.247
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.184

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.885
ABOUT WHICH SILO THERE AND NOT

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:27.386
REALLY THINK ABOUT THEM

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.221
TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK THIS

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.123
AGAIN THE CAP AND TRADE WE HAD

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.859
DISCUSSIONS ON THAT BEFORE-

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.160
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:37.663
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.364
DETERMINATION TO KEEP CAP AND

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.799
TRADE. CLIMATE POLICY RATHER

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.901
THAN POLLUTION POLICY AND WE'VE

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.636
WE'VE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:48.507
ARE IN THERE DIRECTING- BUT

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.475
WHEN YOU'RE A- FROM GENERAL

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:51.510
FUND SO THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:54.880
THIS HOLISTIC- INTERPLAY

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.849
BETWEEN THESE HUGE PACKAGES

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:01.620
THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE GOING ON-

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.822
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. ALL

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.591
THESE PACKAGES TAKEN TOGETHER

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.359
FROM THE ALLEY OWES POSITION

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:11.263
THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:11.964
SEEMS AN ALMOST

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.565
INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT IS THERE

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.134
IS THERE SOMETHING FROM THE LA

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.236
O'S OFFICE THAT WE HAVE SORT OF

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.737

WILDFIRES PACKAGE. YEAH IT'S

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.614
CERTAINLY- AND YOU KNOW A

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.583
MATTER OF PRIORITIES AND IF YOU

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.185
LOOK KIND OF IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:34.052
PACKAGES IN THE SENATE'S

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.387
PACKAGING EATING THERE'S A LOT

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.722
OF STUFF IN HERE. I THINK WHEN

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.023
THE AREA THAT WE HAVE

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.957
HIGHLIGHTED IN SOME OF OUR

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.225
REPORTS PREVIOUSLY IN

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.293
PARTICULAR AND THEN SOME OF THE

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.494
WORK WE'VE DONE ON SEA LEVEL

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.662
RISE IS THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.165
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY. AND

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.266
ESPECIALLY WHERE THAT'S WHERE

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:48.801
THE LAND USE DECISIONS ARE MADE

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.102
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE LOCAL

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.538
INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOUND AND SO

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.239
THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.108
SUPPORT YOU CAN GIVE. AND WHAT

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.409
THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:58.777
STATE IS IN SUPPORTING LOCAL

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:01.213
GOVERNMENTS FOR PLANNING- AND

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.047
FOR IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS AND

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.415
IN PARTICULAR FOR WORKING

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.651
ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES AND

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.052
LOOKING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL FOR

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.487
SEA LEVEL RISE THAT'S GOING TO

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:11.290
BE HUGE AND SO- THAT THAT MAY

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.458
BE AN AREA YOU MIGHT WANT TO

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.159
THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.561
IS HOW. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:16.795
STATE AND SUPPORTING AND

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:17.896
HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.665
PLANNING AND BREAKING DOWN SOME

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:25.771
pLEVEL SO THEY. CAN BE WORKING

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.506
AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. IN DM I

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.941
KNOW THAT THE SENATE WHILE.

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.709

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.349
SENATE PACKAGE ON CLIMATE

CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE. PROGRAM

DOLLARS. A BOATLOAD OF MONEY

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.464

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:07.246

ADMINISTRATION ON- WHAT LOOKS

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:13.938
LIKE A- SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.207
AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THOSE.

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.408
ELEMENTS OF RESPONSE WHEN YOU

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.510
THINK ABOUT 60% OF THE STATE IN

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:21.412
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WITH

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.548
SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM WATER

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.782
NEEDS FOR THIS ONE TIME

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.218
INVESTMENT- WE JUST GOT SOME

RIGHT NOW SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.632
GET A SENSE FROM- THE LOGIC OF

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.401
THE ADMINISTRATION'S. MAY

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:46.604
REVISE PROPOSAL ON THOSE

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:54.779
ELEMENTS. THIRD ROAD RUNNING

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.213
FINE AND I'LL JUST I'LL KICK IT

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.082
OFF AND THEN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.016
COLLEAGUES HERE FROM THE

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.451
DEPARTMENT THAT COULD SPEAK A

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:02.353
LITTLE BIT TO THE VARIOUS

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:07.658
PROPOSALS. I THINK ONE THING.

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:08.292
THEY'LL START OFF BY NOTING IS.

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.560
ACROSS SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.862
VERY VERY S. ELIGIBLE USES AND

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.331
DIFFERENT ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.800
AND SO EVEN THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.068
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T SEE.

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:18.603
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP CALLED OUT

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:19.737
SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THE

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.305
OTHER PROGRAMS THEY ARE LIKE AN

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:23.741
ELIGIBLE USE OF OTHER TYPES OF.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.142
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE LIKE A LUMP

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:26.744
AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SO

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.446
THAT'S KIND OF THE ONE OF THE-

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.848
ADS WERE BEING CROSSWALKS OF A

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.083
LOT OF THESE PACKAGES

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:33.784
SOMETIMES. WERE CALLING THINGS

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:34.986
DIFFERENTLY BUT BUT YOU

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:37.021
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF SIMILAR

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.990
ELIGIBLE USES WITHIN THE

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:40.791
EXISTING PROGRAMS TARGETING

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.394
ALSO WROTE BY NOTING THAT- THEN

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.262
THE OTHER YOU KNOW JUST ISSUE

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:47.098
ALTHOUGH IT IS- YOU KNOW AS WE

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:49.734
WERE LOOKING AT- THE AMERICAN

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.069
RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING AND WE-

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.271
ALLOCATED DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT-

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.573
THERE'S SPECIFIC TIMELINES

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:07.418
THAT- KIND OF IDENTIFIED AS-

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.086
WHEN. THE MONEY NEED TO BE

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.287
COVERED- IN LIQUIDATED A PART

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.088
OF COUNTRY TO THE WE HAD A SOME

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.323
OF THESE INVESTOR. I WAS

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.057
LOOKING. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.158
ARE SOME SOME PROJECTS. COULD

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:17.862
MEET THOSE THOSE. RE SO JUST A

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:19.730
THINGS AND- BUT NOT SURE IF-

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.198
BUT THE WAY BORDER OR DEPART A

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:24.235
WATERY. AS ANY MORE DETAILS ASK

00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:26.037
TO OF THEIR PER. AND HOW. IT

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.571
ADDRESSES RECYCLING AND GARBAGE

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:36.313
WATER THE. THIS WILL STORM

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.015
WATER COULD. YOUR HIGHNESS IS

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.551
MY LAW WITH CLOSE LOTTERY.

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.753
CONTROL BOARD AND WE ADMINISTER

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.454
BOTH THE WATER IS AND

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.056
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP FUNDING AND

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:48.225
THE AS FAR AS WATERY. THAT MOST

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.393
ARE ELEGY FOR OUR STATE

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.461
REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS AND SO

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.762
THAT IS TO PICK WHERE WE FUND

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.064
WATER RECYCLE PROJECT. WE OFTEN

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.865
DO HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF GRANT

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.701
FUNDS THAT THAT GO ALONG WITH

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:58.069
THOSE PHONES BUT THEY'RE

00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.637
GENERALLY TOWARDS THE LARGER

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:01.772
MORE SOPHISTICATED AGENCIES

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:02.673
THAT ARE DOING THOSE TYPES OF

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.909
PROJECTS AND SO WHAT WE FOCUSED

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.243
ON WHAT'S THE WATER LIKE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.845
DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.180
FUNDING FROM THE AMERICAN

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:10.848
RESCUE PLAN IS AS MISTER

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.050
AGYARKO INDICATED WE'RE

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.385
PROJECTS THAT COULD MEET THE

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.587
TIMING OF THE VERY SHORT TIME

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:17.855
FRAMES FOR CONSTRUCTING THOSE

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.257
PROJECTS AND ALSO FOCUSING ON

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.959
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY NEEDS

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.728
SO WE REALLY FOCUSED. THOSE

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.796
FUNDS ON ON THOSE PROJECTS AND

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.231
THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.833
PRETTY MUCH IN HOUSE READY TO

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:33.738
GO. THAT COULD MEET THOSE

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:39.243
CONSTRUCTION TIME FRAMES. OKAY

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.778
I WOULD JUST NOTE FOR THEIR FOR

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:41.612
THE RECORD THAT YOUR YOUR

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:44.014
ANALYSIS- FROM THE WATER BOARD

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.016
INDICATES I THINK SEVEN HUNDRED

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:46.650
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.018
PROJECTS THAT ARE. READY TO GO

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:50.554
SO. AS I KNOW THAT'LL BE AN

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.856
ONGOING ISSUE FOR DISCUSSION

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.758
AND APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.259
ON THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:57.728
PACKAGE OPEN TO GET. HOPING TO

00:39:57.795 --> 00:40:01.098
RAISE THE QUESTION ON THIS-

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.000
THIS DISPARITY BETWEEN THE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.835
SENATE'S MAY TWENTY FIFTH

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:05.669
PROPOSAL AND THEN THE MAY

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:08.472
REVISE- ON A REGIONAL CLIMATE

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:11.075
RESILIENCE- SPECIFICALLY IN

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:13.778
THE- FIRST STATE CONSERVANCIES.

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.446
AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL CLIMATE

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.314
RESILIENCE PROJECTS I THINK THE

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.183
SENATE HAS SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.118
FIVE MILLION. DOLLARS THERE AND

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:25.623
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS- ZERO IN

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:28.092
THOSE CATEGORIES- THAT'S A

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:32.062
CHALLENGE- THE LA RIVER ALSO IN

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:35.032
URBAN STREAMS HAS ZERO- SIR

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.534
TWENTY GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE I

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.169
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BEST.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:42.473
CENTER D. O. F. OR C. N. R. A.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.409
BUT HOPING TO- SHED SOME LIGHT

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:51.649
ON THOSE DISPARITIES AS WELL.

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:56.053
GO AHEAD. FINANCE IF YOU CAN S.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.755
OR DIFFERENT FINANCING I'LL

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:58.722
KICK IT OFF AND THEN MAYBE A

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.791
TURNOVER TO LIE RESEARCH AGENCY

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:01.592
COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:03.394
ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE ONE

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.529
THING ALTHOUGH IT IS YOU KNOW

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:06.430
FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DO

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.766
HAVE THE CONSERVANCY'S AND THE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.567
PROJECTS WITHIN THE

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:10.768
CONSERVANCIES ARE DEFINITELY

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.369
ELIGIBLE AND SO EVEN THOUGH

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.038
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY CALLING

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:16.040
OUT YOU KNOW X. DOLLAR MATRYX

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.575
CONSERVANCIES THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.476
THAT THAT THE PROJECTS AND THE

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:21.478
PROGRAMS WITHIN THOSE I WOULD

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.347
NOT BE ELIGIBLE SO- YEAH I

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:24.481
THINK THAT'S ONE OF PERSPECTIVE

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:26.851
IS HAVING. A BROADER PROGRAM ON

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:28.519
ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND THEN

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.621
WITHIN THAT PROGRAM- YOU KNOW

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.089
HAVING THE PROJECTS WITH THE

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.226
CONSERVANCY'S BE ABLE TO APPLY

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:37.127
TO ALSO MEET THOSE GOALS NOT

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:42.266
SURE THE RESERVATIONS. HERE

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:42.833
ANYTHING ELSE- ELABORATE ON

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.467
THAT. I WAS GONNA SAY THE SAME

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:44.835
THING THAT. I CAN. ARE ELIGIBLE

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:45.870
FOR THE OTHER PROGRAM THIS IS

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.805
CASH THE NATURAL RESOURCE THEY-

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:51.775
DO. AND AS TO THE RIVER AND THE

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:57.014
OTHER URBAN AND RIVER. THERE IS

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.516
FUNDING LIKE URBAN GREENING-

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:01.118
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO TWO

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:04.555
PROJECTS- GREENING PROJECTS

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:05.189
THAT COULD BE DONE ALONG THE LA

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:10.961
RIVER. IMPORTANT IF THE YEAH

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:12.496
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.664
THE OVERALL WATERSHED

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:15.132
PROTECTION ISSUE THOUGH WE'RE

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.400
WE'VE GOT I THINK THE SENATE'S

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.335
GOT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:19.703
MILLION COMMITTED TO THAT AND

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.472
THERE'S ABOUT A SIX HUNDRED

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.473
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR DISPARITY

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:25.109
BETWEEN OUR PROPOSAL AND THE

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:25.743
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THERE

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:28.412
WHERE- EVEN IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:29.780
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S-

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.482
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO MEET

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.249
THOSE SORT OF MULTI BENEFIT

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:35.419
NEEDS SO- JUST TO TRY TO GET.

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:39.556
SORT OF THE UNDERLYING POLICY.

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:40.124
BECTIVE ON WHY THAT'S NOT AS

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:47.665
MUCH OF A PRIORITY. THIS IS

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:48.832
BRIAN CASH AGAIN FROM NATURAL

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.035
RESOURCES AGENCY- WE DO FEEL

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:52.870
LIKE THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:55.506
PRIORITY AND- WHERE POSSIBLE

00:42:55.572 --> 00:42:57.207
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.843
IN OTHER PROGRAMS AND- YOU KNOW

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.178
WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.213
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SENATE AND

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.350
THE ASSEMBLY. THROUGH THE

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.618
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO-

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.019
FURTHER REFINED THE PACKAGE

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:12.856
THAT NEEDED. WE ARE JUST NOTE

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.858
DEPUTY CASHIN FOR FINANCE ALSO

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.393
SAID THERE WAS THE GOVERNOR

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.129
EARLIER HAD A CLIMATE BOND THAT

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:22.066
THAT HE HAD FLOATED OUT THE

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:24.201
SENATE HAS A PUBLIC CLIMATE.

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.236
THE ASSEMBLY HAS A CLAIM UPON

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:28.772
AND ONE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.541
THEY WERE LOOKING AT IS THE

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:32.076
WATERSHED PROTECTION THE SORT

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:33.544
OF STARTS OFF AT THE WATERSHED

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.212
YES THERE'S EXTREME HEAT

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.947
ELEMENTS THAT WITH THE URBAN

THESE OTHER INVESTMENTS-

00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:18.615
ANOTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.350
ON SENATOR STERN'S EARLIER

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:24.087
QUESTION IS REALLY HOW CRITICAL

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:26.423
THESE ARE EIGHT BEAST REGIONAL

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.991
STRATEGIES ARE TO JUST

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:30.127
UNDERSCORE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:30.994
THAT THE GOAL IS FOR THE

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:32.462
REGIONAL STRATEGIES TO BAND

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.898
DIRECTOR R. GRANT DOLLARS AND

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:37.434
THESE BROAD GRAND BUCKETS. INTO

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.002
THE PRIORITIES THAT THE REGION

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:41.104
IS IDENTIFYING WHICH INCLUDES

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:43.240
HOME HARDENING AND- IN THE

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:44.741
FUTURE WE ABSOLUTELY DO YOU

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.943
WANT TO SCALE UP HOME HARDENING

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.779
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:50.781
THAT THE DIRECT ASSISTANCE ON

00:50:50.847 --> 00:51:03.160
HOME GARDENING. IS A NEW

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:05.128
PROGRAM THAT MISSTATES A

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.229
PROGRAM THAT I WE ARE LONG THIS

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.931
YEAR THIS THE FIRST TIME. IT IS

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:09.499
GETTING UNDER AND SO ARE PART A

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:12.235
HOW MILLION DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:14.037
TO. THE MODEL AND THEN SCALE IT.

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:14.805
SO EVENTUALLY WE WANT TO SEE IF

00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:29.252
I MANAGE AND- HARDENING. INTO.

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:32.088
SEEING SO. I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:33.657
WHAT THE HELL WE'RE GONNA TRACK

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.659
IT NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUR

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.160
OUTCOMES IS GONNA BE CRITICAL

IS THAT'S AN ENERGY- PUB

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.993
ELEMENT NOT A TROUT OR

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.795
RESILIENCY DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.897
MORE WATER IN A PUMPED STORAGE

PROTECTION PEACE AND ESPECIALLY

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.083
UTILIZING THE W. C. B. WHICH I

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.186
THINK IS PROVING ITSELF AS IT.

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:27.489
EFFECTIVE ARM OF. OF US YOU

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:29.357

ITS IN THE CATEGORIZATION SO

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:39.501
THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.035
DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:42.037

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:49.411
THE SAME WAY BUT- BUT I SENT.

I'M GETTING AN INTENT FROM FROM

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.914
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT-

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.316
THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.751
THIS FUNDING. IF WE IF WE

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:57.319
APPROPRIATE THESE KIND OF

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.688
DOLLARS. THROUGH THE W. C. B.

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:00.555
AND MAKE THIS KIND OF

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.490
AUGMENTATION DO I HAVE THAT

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:06.595
THEY'RE RIGHT. SENATOR LIKE YOU

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:09.998

CROSSING AND FISH PASSAGE

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.903
PROJECTS I DO THINK THOSE

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.105
PROJECTS ARE BOTH CLIMATE

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:20.275
RESILIENCY AND DROUGHT WATER

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:21.743
RESILIENCY PROJECTS.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.445
UNATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.981
INVESTING IN THE W. C. T. B. AS

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:29.484
IT'S A KNOWN ENTITY. ACROSS THE

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.087
STATE WITH A LONG TRACK RECORD.

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:35.357
FOR WHICH- BOTH THE SENATE AND

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:38.126

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.428
REMEMBERS. AND THE GRANT MAKING

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:44.165
AND- PROJECT INVESTMENT IS DONE

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:47.235
IN A PUBLIC PUBLIC FORUM. SO I

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.603
THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:51.573

KIND OF THE POINT POINT SIGN.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.056
BUT JUST A NOTE ON THAT TYPE OF

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:56.557
NEEDS THAT WE SEE FROM COMING

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:57.792
FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:05.967
STATE SIDE MISSILES WITH. THE

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:06.801
ELIO. RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MR

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.770
CHAIR- YET THERE. I THINK

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:09.837
THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR PLAY.

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:10.404
AND THERE'S ARE OF IDENTIFY

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:11.038
PROJECTS BUT I THINK THING THAT

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:13.641
IMPORTANT ABOUT IS- WHO ARE THE

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.710
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE THE PLANS

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.812
AND PROJECTS READY TO GO AND

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:19.247
WHO ARE THOSE THAT MIGHT NOT

BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.116
CAPACITY AND MAYBE THAT'S AN

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:23.618
AREA. THAT THE STATE REALLY

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:24.952
WANTS TO FOCUS ON TO MAKE SURE

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:26.187
THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:29.390
ARE LEFT BEHIND- AS INTERFERING

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.725
FOR CLAIM IT. I THINK THAT

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.560
REALLYGETS TO A POINT THAT-

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:33.895
THAT ALSO SPEAKS TO SENATOR

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.830
DOLLIES QUESTIONS EARLIER ON

EARLIER WHEN IT COMES TO

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:04.285
HARDENING. IN THAT THERE MAY BE

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.253
SOME TRIP TODAY SHOULD WE GET

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:05.820

AND- IN. TOO MUCH PUBLIC SO. IN

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.489

DEFINE THE AREAS THAT ARE MOST

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:24.238
VULNERABLE. TO WILDFIRE OR TO

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.340
FLOOD WHAT TO C. LEVEL RISE AND

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.276
ACTUALLY MICROTARGETING THAT.

01:32:28.342 --> 01:32:29.310

AN ORPHAN WELLS AS WELL AS IDA

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:39.780
WELLS THAT REALLY ARE RIGHT BE-

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:42.049
IT CATEGORIZES DESERTED AND

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:44.418
TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION- I

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:45.853
THINK THE INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDS

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:46.720
THIS POINT AND THERE'S BEEN

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:48.622
SOME FRUSTRATION EVEN THERE

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:50.791
FROM THE INDUSTRY SIDE AND FROM

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.626
THE FOLKS IN LABOR WHO WORK IN

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:53.560
OIL AND GAS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.629
GETTING ENOUGH. THROUGHPUT WHEN

IT COMES TO THE PLUGGING

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:58.632
PROCESS I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:00.734
REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.903
TO DO THIS WORK I DON'T THINK

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.104
IT SHOULD ALL BE ON THE PUBLIC

01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:05.472
DIME THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:06.707
DOLLAR PROPOSAL I THINK IS

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.809
EXCITING BUT WE'D REALLY LIKE

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:10.244
TO SEE GOING FORWARD HOW WE CAN

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.313
FIND A PARTNERSHIP HERE. SOME

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:14.348

IF WE COULD TAKE SAY YOU KNOW

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.330
RIGHT NOW THE TARGET IS I THINK

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:30.531
THIRTY EIGHT WELLS TO BE CLOSER

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:31.832
TO THE ORPHAN WELL PROGRAM OVER

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.534
THE NEXT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OUT

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.903

YEAR AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD I

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:51.685

WE CAN LAND SOME BIGGER

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:12.072
