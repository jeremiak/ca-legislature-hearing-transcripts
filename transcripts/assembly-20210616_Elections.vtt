QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISMAS. SO

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.004
I'VE- THERE'S BEEN A COULE OF

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:05.008
BILLS- IN THE PAST- THAT- I DID

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:07.711
NOT BUT THE NOT SUPPORT- AND

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:08.812
I'M STILL NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:10.614
I'M GONNA DO WELL WHICH IS

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.214
WEIRD BECAUSE ABOUT TO TAKE A

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:15.986
VOTE. ON THIS BILL- THE REASON-

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:17.054
THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS THAT

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.357
I'M- THE FIVE ONE QUESTION IN

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:21.258
THE MAYBE WE GOT A STATEMENT

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:26.997
HERE TO IS- WHY PRIVATE RIGHT

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:29.966
OF ACTION. WHY IS THAT

00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:32.102
NECESSARY AND SO IT'S I THINK

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.204
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO WE HAVE

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.939
ADDED THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:39.076
ACTION I TO ADDRESS PRECISELY-

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.644
WHAT MR MAHAMA NOTED THAT THEY

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:41.745
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN RELATIVELY

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.980
FEW- COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATION

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:46.383
OF THE EURASIAN AND WE

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.785
ATTRIBUTE THAT FACT. TO THE

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:51.021
TRUE THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.556
IN POWER RIGHT NOW TO ENFORCE

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:54.257
EXISTING ELECTION CODE WHICH

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.759
MAKES IT EXPRESS ILLEGAL MAKES

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.561
IT A MISDEMEANOR TO ATTENTION

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.929
MISLEAD A VOTER AS TO THE

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.330
NATURE INTENT OF A CENTURY

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:02.032
RATIONS ABOUT MOST OF THOSE

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.266
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER TO

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.968
ENFORCE THE LAW OR THEMSELVES

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:05.869
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:07.571
THEMSELVES POLITICAL ACTORS. AS

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.139
A RESULT THEY ARE THOROUGHLY

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:10.574
DISINCLINED TO INSERT

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.743
THEMSELVES INTO THIS PROCESS-

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.611
AND SO ALTHOUGH ANECDOTALLY WE

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:17.280
KNOW THE NUMBER OF. VIOLATIONS

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:20.550
IS OF A MAGNITUDE HIGHER-

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:21.551
THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.687
ENFORCEMENT- INTO THIS IS AN

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:28.925
ATTEMPT TO REALIGN THE SYSTEM.

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:29.526
SO THAT WE GET A GREATER LEVEL

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:30.327
OF ACCOUNTABILITY. I THERE'S

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.194
BEEN TO BE- A. B. NINETY FORTY

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:33.697
SO AND ALSO AB FOURTEEN FIFTY

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:35.165
ONE THAT- THAT THE TIME TO DO

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:37.100
THIS VERY SAME THING ONE WAS. A

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.268
VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN THE

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:41.071
OTHER ONE WAS- VETOED BY

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:41.638
GOVERNOR SOME WISE THIS BILL

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.507
DIFFERENT. RIGHT YEAH I CAN I

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:45.041
THINK OF SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:46.209
TAKE TIME I THINK IS WORTH

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.043
NOTING THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.679
LOWE'S IS THE AUTHOR OF

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:52.649
MOBILIZATION MADE THROUGH. THE

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.684
LEGISLATURE. AT THE EVIDENCE

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:58.488
OVER TIME HAS I THINK- A CREW

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:00.090
THAT DID THAT THIS IS NECESSARY

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.258
AND TWO MISSED SOME MISTER

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:03.360
HOBBS COMMENTS. IT IS NOT TRUE

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:04.761
OR CERTAINLY NOT TO MOST WHICH-

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:05.562
THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE THE

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.497
COST OF ELECTIONS- WHAT IT

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.566
WOULD DO IS IT WOULD INCREASE

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.735
THE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN. YOU

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.037
KNOW SINGS GETTING PROCESS-

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:15.071
THAT IS A GOOD THING AND I

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:17.007
SUSPECT THIS GOVERNOR HAS SEEN

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.975
FIRST HAND. HOW THE SYSTEM

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.711
WORKS AND- I AM HOPEFUL THAT IF

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:23.013
AND WHEN THIS BILL NEXT TO HIS

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:24.781
DESK ON THIS OCCASION- THAT

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:25.882
HE'S INCLINED TO SIGN I ALSO

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:27.117
WANT TO POINT OUT AS I'VE DONE.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.318
INVESTMENT HEARINGS THAT THIS

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:30.420
BILL WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.522
IMPACT. ON THE CURRENT RECALL

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.523
EFFORT AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.025
SERVICES MEANT. TO MOVE

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:38.495
FORWARD- MATTER- TO THE AS I

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:41.898
