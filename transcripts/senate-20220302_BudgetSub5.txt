OKAY AXLE HEY WE CAN SEE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE US PERFECT THAT'S TERRIFIC AND THE AUDIENCE OKAY ALREADY OKAY THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AGAIN I'M KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE B. S. C. C. I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE ALLISON GANTER TO TALK ABOUT THE BSE SEES JAIL INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH ARE CORE TO THE BST SEES MISSION. I'M GONNA GIVE A OVERVIEW OF OUR JAIL INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES AND TRY TO COVER THE THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ASKED US TO TOUCH ON AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. SOME OF THE PENAL CODE SETS FORTH REQUIREMENTS THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE BSP C. INSPECT ALL COUNTY DETENTION FACILITIES BOTH. ADULT AND JUVENILE AND BECAUSE OF STATUTORY CHANGES THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL BUDGET RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED. WE NOW INSPECT EACH FACILITY DANIEL. PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOSE VISITS THOSE INSPECTIONS WERE. AT LEAST ONCE OVER A TWO YEAR CYCLE SO WE'RE NOW ABLE TO INSPECT FACILITIES MORE FREQUENTLY. IN ADDITION WE NOW HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT NEW TOOL AND ONE THAT I EXPECT WILL COME INTO PLAY IN RESPONSE TO ISSUES LIKE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE IN THE RECENT. AUDIT ABOUT SAN DIEGO COUNTY. PRIOR TO LAST YEAR'S B. C. P. WE HAD EIGHT INSPECTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLETING THE INSPECTIONS. REPORTS AND PROVIDING EXTENSIVE ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY DISABILITIES AND I'M I'M SURE THAT MANY TO REMEMBER AS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT SOME LENGTH LAST YEAR. WE ARE SO PLEASED TO BE ADDING ANY ADDITIONAL INSPECTORS AND SOME ANALYTICAL STAFF AS WELL. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS WHICH THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED US TO DEVELOP IN TWENTY TWENTY. SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT WORK. I WANT TO GIVE A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INSPECTION PROCESS WORKS- TITLE FIFTEEN SETS FORTH THE REGULATIONS FOR THE OPERATION OF- COUNTY FACILITIES AND TITLE TWENTY FOUR. ADDRESSES PHYSICAL PLANT ISSUES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE IN PERSON INSPECTIONS WE BEGIN WITH THE REVIEW OF POLICIES ON MANY OF OUR REGULATIONS ARE WHAT'S KNOWN AS PERFORMANCE BASED AND IT DIRECTS THE AGENCY TO HAVE A POLICY ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF. SUBJECTS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE OPERATION OF THE FACILITY SO WE BEGIN WITH REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BOTH POLICY AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO DETERMINE IF THE LOCAL. AGENCY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE FIFTEEN OR TITLE TWENTY FOUR AS THE CASE MAY BE. WE CAN DO A PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE FACILITY INVOLVES- WALKING ALL AROUND THE FACILITY USING ALL OF THE ON SITE- INFORMATION AVAILABLE- IN YOU KNOW WITH THE BIG. CHECKLIST AND ALL THE REST WE ALSO TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO TALK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSED IN THE LOCAL FACILITY AND PEOPLE WHO. WORK THERE- THE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS PROCESS IS DO. PATTERNS OF COMPLIANCE OR NON COMPLIANCE- TURNING BACK TO THE GOAL OF THE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS WHICH I MIGHT REFER TO AS THE P. I. P. THE GOAL OF THAT IS TO MORE ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH- THE COUNTIES WITH OUR BOARD. AND TO PROVIDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALL WHO ARE INTERESTED IN OUR INSPECTIONS- I'M FOCUSING MOSTLY ON ADULT DISABILITIES TODAY AS NOTED. IN THE AGENDA FOR TODAY THE BOARD DOES HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO JUVENILE HALLS AND WE CAN TAKE QUESTIONS ON THAT LATER BUT FOR NOW I'M FOCUSING ON OUR ADULT JAIL INSPECTIONS. AS IS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA OF THE BST SEEN AS A STATE ENTITY THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ESTABLISHED REGULATIONS FOR JAIL OPERATIONS AND THEN TO INSPECT TO THOSE STANDARDS. AND I CAN ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT I BELIEVE WE CARRY OUT THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES VERY WELL. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE STATE DOES NOT RUN A LOCAL JAILS CDCR IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF STATE PRISONS AND THEY HAVE SOME. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO DISSECT- RULES AND SUCH WITH RESPECT TO STATE PRISONS BUT THE COUNTY. FACILITIES ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT TO REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION- THE BSE SEEN AS AN INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE ENTITY WE DON'T HAVE INVESTIGATIVE OR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WE DON'T HAVE SUBPOENA POWER WE CAN'T FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES WE CAN ISSUE FINES. WE CAN'T GO TO COURT TO SUE FOR COMPLIANCE AND IN ADDITION AS THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE THERE ARE ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINIONS STATING THAT. OUR REGULATIONS ARE NOT MANDATORY. BUT THE LESS IN CARRYING OUT OUR RISK TO. CONSIST WITH THE STATUTES AND THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE I THINK WE ARE ABSOLUTELY MEETING THAT MARK. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE ARE VERY MEANINGFUL INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS AND I'M SURE OTHER PANELISTS WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THESE TOPICS. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES WHEN FACILITIES DO NOT ABIDE BY THE REGULATIONS AND THOSE INCLUDE. CIVIL LIABILITY POTENTIAL LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT AND POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY- AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE PUBLIC FACING ASPECTS OF OUR INSPECTIONS- ALLISON GANTER OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER INSPECTIONS NOW WE'RE PORTS AT EACH PUBLIC BOARD MEETING. ON THE STATUS OF INSPECTIONS AND WHEN THERE IS A CASE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY HAS NOT ADDRESSED OUTSTANDING ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE. FOLLOWING A PRESCRIBED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION WE REQUEST TO SHARE HER PROBATION GENES TO ATTEND THE NEXT SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING TO LET US KNOW WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE- AND SO THERE'S MUCH MORE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S TAKING PLACE. AT OUR APRIL BOARD MEETING NEXT MONTH WE WILL BE HEARING FROM ONE OF THE SHARES IN BASED ON AN INVITATION LIKE THAT. IN SUMMARY THE PURPOSE OF THE JAIL INSPECTIONS TO DETERMINE IF THE FACILITY IS IN COMPLIANCE. WITH TITLE DEREGULATION'S- ON THE ON. ENTITLED FOUR PHYSICAL PLANT. IN PROCESS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS MULTI LAYERED IT INVOLVES EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUTSIDE OF THE ONSITE INSPECTINS AND OUR INSPECTION TEAM SPENDS TIME ENSURING THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION IS HAPPENING WHEN IT'S NEEDED. WITHIN THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE DEVELOPED A RESPONSIVE AND MEANINGFUL PROGRAM FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M AWARE THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING THE RECENT AUDIT CONCERNING A- HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATE OF DEATHS IN CUSTODY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THAT CAUGHT IT RAISES ISSUES OF UTMOST CONCERN AND THE BOARD WHILE WE TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS WE WILL BE DISCUSSING FURTHER AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS PERTAIN TO THE BST C. N. OUTSIDE AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY. THANK YOU MISS HOWARD- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE L. A. O. WHO WILL BE PRESENTING. AFTERNOON MY INSURER AND MEMBERS THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WELCOME MISSILE MAIL. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF AGE FORTY THAT WE PUBLISHED LAST FEBRUARY ON BBC C. STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS PROGRAM. AND I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT- CALL THE REVIEW OF STATE STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS FOR LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES WHICH ALONG WITH OUR REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT LA O. DOT CA DOT GOV- UNDER PUBLICATIONS TAB. EIGHTY ONE. SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE STC WHICH I WON'T GO INTO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME THOUGH IT IS HERE FOR YOUR REFERENCE. NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE LOCAL DETENTION FACILITY STANDARDS INSPECTION PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF THE SEC'S FOUR MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES AND MISS HOWARD OKAY RT GAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS BUT JUST AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL JUST TO. REITERATE THE KEY POINTS- STATUE REQUIRES THE SEC PERFORM THREE ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE TO MAINTAIN OUR THREE MAIN IT MIGHT MEAN ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROGRAM WHICH ARE TO MAINTAIN. THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION I INSPECT FACILITIES ON A REGULAR BASIS RELATIVE TO THOSE STANDARDS- AND REPORT ON COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS. AND WE NOTE THAT. THE FCC DOES NOT HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO- DIRECTLY ENFORCE THE STANDARDS. MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE WE ARE DESCRIBED BRIEFLY THE MODIFICATIONS AND THE SEC HAS BEEN MAKING IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE FROM THAT EARLY TWENTY TWENTY. AND I ALSO WON'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL ON THESE GIVEN THAT- MISS HOWARD ALSO DESCRIBES SOME OF THESE CHANGES BUT- GENERALLY WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT PROBABLY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH. ANNA REED REASONING FOR THAT- CONCLUSION SHOULDBECOME CLEAR IN MY DISCUSSION OF OUR ASSESSMENT WHICH ALL RIGHT- COVER PAGE FIVE I'M IN REALLY IT'S VERY PRETTY SIMPLE ASSESSMENT AT ITS HEART WITH ME- AND THAT IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT ANY PROGRAM WE ASK WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND IS IT MEETING THOSE GOALS. AND WE FOUND IN THIS CASE THAT THE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR STATUTORY MISSION OR GOALS- AND THIS LEAVES SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION IN DEFINING. THE MISSION AND GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. THERE IS SOME CONCERN. THAT THE INFORMAL MISSION CURRENTLY OF THE PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY TO PROMOTE LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS INSIDE LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES NOTHING. WOULD PREVENT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM OPERATING UNDER DIFFERENT INFORMAL MISSION IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION THE LACK OF CLEARLY DEFINED GOALS. LEAVES SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION FOR SEC TO DETERMINE HOW WHATEVER AN INFORMAL MISSION IT ADOPTS IS ACHIEVED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT B. B. C. C. FOR EXAMPLE DECIDED THAT- IT WANTED TO FOCUS ON PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY AROUND CONDITIONS INSIDE DETENTION FACILITIES. THEN ONE WOULD EXPECT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO BE FULFILLED BY- REPORTS THAT ARE VERY ACCESSIBLE TO LAY PERSON AUDIENCES IN CONTRAST TO THE EXTENT THE STC CHOSE TO FOCUS INSTEAD MORE NARROWLY ON- PROVIDING A SERVICE TO LOCAL DETENTION FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS- IT WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT THE REPORT REASONABLY EXPECT THE REPORTS TO CONTAIN JARGON AND- BE WRITTEN FOR MORE FOR A FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR. AUDIENCE AND THEN FINALLY THAT LACK OF A CLEAR MISSION AND GOALS UNDERMINES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S SIMPLY WITHOUT CLEAR GOALS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROGRAM FOR FILLS AN IMPORTANT STATE FUNCTIONS THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURED A RESOURCE. AND WHETHER IT IS OPERATING EFFECTIVELY AND ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. WHICH MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE OF THE REST OF MY COMMENTS AND HAND OUT PERTAINING TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN LIGHT OF THIS ASSESSMENT AND A HIGH LEVEL WE HAVE THREE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ARE TO ONE SIDE A CLEAR MISSION AND GOALS IN STATUTE FOR THE PROGRAM. TO ALIGN THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP WEST THAT MISSION AND GOALS AND THREE TO REQUIRE BSE SEAT TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW IT WILL ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH THE MISSION AND GOALS. YOU'RE GOING INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION AS I MENTIONED IS TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR PROGRAM MISSION AND GOALS AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE ANY MISSION AND GOALS THAT IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE BUT WE DO RECOMMEND SOME SPECIFIC MISSION AND GOALS- AND ON A MISSION WE RECOMMEND IS TO PROMOTE LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS INSIDE LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. AND TO FURTHER THAT MISSION WE RECOMMEND FOR SPECIFIC GOALS. WHICH ARE TO ONE MAINTAIN STANDARDS THAT HELP LOCAL LEADERS DETERMINE AND MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH CAN BE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE- INTO PRACTICE TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC- AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGH STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS. THREE TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE PROVISION OF LEGAL HUMANIST- AND SAFE CONDITIONS. AND FOR TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATION- WHEN IT IS TO ALIGN THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP WITH THE MISSION WHATEVER MISSION AND GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE SELECTS AND BASED ON OUR RECOMMENDED MISSION AND GOALS WE THINK THAT- IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BALANCE THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP IN ORDER TO FACILITATE MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT ROLE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BOARD CURRENTLY- HAS NO MEMBERS WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE IN EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF DETENTION FACILITIES AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO BEFORE RECENT VACANCY OPENED UP ON THE BOARD- SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN B. SEC BOARD MEMBERS WERE ADMINISTRATORS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR WHICH- OPERATED FACILITIES THAT. WERE INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM. SO THE BOARD HAS NO SHORTAGE OF IMPORTANT EXPERTISE ON OPERATION OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES BUT IT LACKS EXPERTISE. ON EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF SUCH FACILITIES WHICH WE SEE AS A DIFFERENT FORM OF EXPERTISE THAT IS IMPORTANT- GIVEN THE THIS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE BOOK AT THE BOARD'S MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THEN WE ALSO RECOMMEND- THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCREASING NUMBER MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY ONLY CURRENTLY TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN BOARD MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE THINK HAVING- MORE BOARD MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE COULD- ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE OF THE BOARD OVERALL AND THE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. AND MOVING ON PAGE SEVEN. HERE WE DID TELL THE- THIRD RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO REQUIRE A PLAN TO- REQUIRED THE SEC TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW IT WOULD ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH ITS WITH THE NEW MISSION AND GOALS. AND WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS PLAN WOULD ENABLE THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY STATUTORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED- OR WHETHER THE SEC NEEDS ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN IT WOULD ALSO FACILITATE FUTURE EVALUATION OF PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. AND TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLAN WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE PLAN DESCRIBED HOW THE SEC WOULD ACHIEVE FIVE KEY OUTCOMES. WHICH ARE ONE THAT THE PLAN SHOULD OUTLINE HOW THE STANDARDS WILL BE REVISED TO BE MORE SUSPICIOUS SPECIFIC SUCH THAT THEY EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WHAT LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS ARE. AND ENSURE THAT THE STANDARDS ARE EQUITABLY ADDRESS THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS OF ALL INMATES AND IT CAN YOU- TO THE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF KEY INFORMATION SUCH AS REPORTED STANDARDS VIOLATIONS. BY THIRD PARTIES ESSENTIALLY- BOARD ESSENTIALLY REPORTS THAT ARE NOT- JUST DISCOVERED BY DSCC INSPECTORS BUT YOU KNOW COULD BE REPORTED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- AND NOT BE A CC COULD USE THIS FOR EXAMPLE AS A WAY TO ADD MORE STRATEGICALLY TARGET INSPECTIONS INDICATE HOW THE SEC WILL DEVELOP CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT BENCHMARKS FOR INSPECTIONS- IS SUCH AS- GUIDANCE. FOR INTERPRETING SUBJECTIVITY IN THE STANDARDS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS TO INSURANCE SECTORS MEET THESE BENCHMARKS. FOUR THE PLAN SHOULD OUTLINE HOW THE SEC WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITS REPORTING ON THE RESULTS OF INSPECTIONS- AND I WOULD NOT BE SEC HAS MADE SOME SOME CHANGES IN THIS RESPECT WHICH HAVE BEEN HELPFUL BUT I THINK WE THINK THAT DATE THAT- THE FTC COULD GO FURTHER SUCH AS BY. ISSUING SPECIAL REPORTS TO HIGHLIGHT CERTAIN- SEVERE CONCERNS ARE TIME SENSITIVE ISSUES- AND NUMBER FIVE- THE PLAN SHOULD GIVE CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDING LONGER TERM MORE COMPLEX TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FACILITIES TO HELP ADDRESS- MORE INTRACTABLE ISSUES THAT CAN TAKE LONGER THAN SIX THE CURRENT SIXTY DAY. COMPLIANCE PERIOD TO ADDRESS AS WELL AS HOW THE FCC CAN HELP- HELP HIGHLIGHT AND PROMOTE PROMISING PRACTICES TO FACILITATE. CONTINUOUS SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT IN DETENTION FACILITY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE END OF MY PREPARED COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS O'NEILL OUR NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR- WHO WHO WILL BE PRESENTING FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. OKAY YES NOW DO YOU HI GOOD AFTERNOON I AM CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICHOLA EACH US WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER OF OUR RECENT REPORT ON LCD- COUNTY JAILS. YOUR HONOR FOCUSED ON THESE DEATHS THAT OCCURRED AT A SAN DIEGO JAILS AND WE FOCUS ON THREE MAIN AREAS- WE FOCUSED ON THE CARE THAT'S PROVIDED. THE SAFETY THAT THAT THAT THEY PERFORM AND ALSO HOW THE RESPONSE TO THESE DEATHS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ISSUES ACROSS ALL OF THESE AREAS WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS- ALSO TOOK A STEP. AND LOOK AT THE STATE AS A WHOLE AND WE NOTED THAT THE NUMBER OF IN CUSTODY DEATHS OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN INCREASING. AND WE LOOK FOR WE LOOK AT WAYS THAT PROTECTION THE STATE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. AND WE LOOKED AT STATE STANDARDS AND TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME GAPS. AND SO WE LOOKED AT THE BORDER CITY COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THE BSE. AND WE REVIEW THE REGULATIONS AND TRY TO SEE WHAT OTHER CHANGES THAT COULD THEY COULD MAKE THAT WHEN THE FACTS ARE THAT WHERE MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA COURTS FOR YOU BECAUSE OUR HOUSE CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING AND WE FOCUS ON THREE MAIN AREAS BASED ON OUR FINDINGS ON THE AUDIT. INTAKE HOW ARE THE SCREENING- INDIVIDUALS WHEN THE INTERFACE SIMILARLY TO IDENTIFY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE SECOND PART WOULD BE SAFETY. HOW ARE THE CHECKING ON THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS NOW YOU DO THE HOURLY ROUNDS THAT- DEPUTIES PERFORMED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALIVE AND WELL. AND LASTLY TRAINING. ARE THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE STATE OF OUR STATE CORRECTIONS OFFICERS AT LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. APPROPRIATE SO THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES AND OTHER CRISES THAT EIGHT IN THERE BY PREVENTING THESE DEATHS BSE STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS. AT EITHER DESIGNED SO THAT ALL FACILITIES I WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THEM SO WHETHER YOU'RE A LARGE FACILITY OR SMALL ONE. THAT'S WHEN WE PERFORMED OUR ARTISTS AND WE LOOKED AT MULTIPLE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WAS A MARKED A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY- IN THEIR POLICIES RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT STANDARDS NEED TO BE ELEVATED AT LEAST FOR THE LARGER FACILITIES IN ORDERSO THAT THERE'S A STANDARD OF CARE PROVIDED. THAT THAT PROTECTS. THE INSIGNIFICANT JORDY OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THE FIRST PART INTAKE- STATE REGULATIONS DO NOT REQUIRE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO SCREEN INDIVIDUALS AT INTAKE. AND THUS A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS MAY GO UNDETECTED AND THE MAY I GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY GET INTO THE FACILITY. I'M IN SAN DIEGO WE FOUND THAT HAPPENING MULTIPLE TIMES WE BELIEVE. AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING DOCKS- THE REGULATIONS BE UPDATED TO REQUIRE FOR LARGER FACILITIES. THAT A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN EVALUATES INDIVIDUALS AT INTAKE SO THAT THEY COULD MOST PROPERLY- I IDENTIFY THESE MEN HEALTH NEEDS AND TO THIS DAY THEY RECEIVE ON THAT CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE SECOND PART RELATES TO SAFETY CHECKS. NOW AND IT DOES STATE REGULATIONS AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDITS REQUIRED THAT THE SAFETY CHECKS WHEN YOU'RE PERFORMING THESE ARE THE ROUNDS. ONLY ARE PERFORMED USING DIRECT VISUAL OBSERVATION BUT THEY DON'T REALLY EXPANSIONIST RUN THE NOW. AND AS A RESULT WE SAW THE WIDE VARIATION BETWEEN HOW DIFFERENT APARTMENTS ARE A CHEF'S APARTMENTS ARE CHECKING ON THE STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS- IN SAN DIEGO IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE FOUND IS WE LOOK AT HOURS OF VIDEO. AND WE FOUND THAT OFFICERS WOULD WALK DOWN THE HALL STOCKLEY TIME'S WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE BARELY GLANCING MISSILE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN DEAD FOR HOURS AND NO ONE. NO ONE NOTICED WRITTEN RECOMMENDING THAT THERE BE A CC UPDATES REGULATIONS. SO THAT DAY IS SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THAT YOU'RE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALIVE. AND IN FACT THIS IS ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH- THE WAY C. C. R. POLICIES ON SAFETY CHECKS AND THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE YOU CHECK MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS LIVE. AND LASTLY TRAINING. WE LOOK AT COMPARABLE PROFESSIONS- AGAINST THAT COULD LOCAL CORRECTION OFFICERS AND WE LOOKED AT PROBATION OFFICERS AND YOU LOOK AT JUVENILE DETENTION OFFICERS AND WE LOOK AT THEIR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THE CAR WAS FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND JUVENILE DETENTION OFFICERS WERE HIGHER THAN THEY ARE FOR LOCAL. DETENTION OFFICERS. GIVEN THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW IN THE COURSE OF SAN DIEGO ON IT IN A REVIEW OF ALL THE SHARES FACILITIES. RELATED TO HARDLY MISSED RESPONDING TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES HOW ARE YOU PERFORMING SAFETY CHECKS IT ONLY MAKES SENSE. THAT THAT DESTROYED ENVIRONMENTS ARE INCREASED TO ALIGN WITH SIMILAR PROFESSIONS. AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME AT THESE FACILITIES. AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT A PORTION OF THESE DESTROYING MEAN SHOULD BE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH. AND GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE BCC'S REGULATIONS- DO TOUCH ON NUMEROUS HEALTH AND SAFETY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT IT ALL ENDS GIVEN THE ISSUES THAT WE FOUND AT SAN DIEGO AND AS PART OF OUR AUDIT IT ONLY MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO ADD TO THEIR BOARD A MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHETHER DEVELOPING THESE REGULATIONS THE R. CORPORATION BEST PRACTICES. TO ENSURE SO THAT- SO- SHIFT PARMA'S PROCESS STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS VERY HELPFUL- WE ARE MUCH MORE. WE'RE GONNA- HERE NOW FROM DON SPECTER WITH THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. MR SPECTER. S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND ADDRESS YOUR TODAY- THE PRISON LAW OFFICES- LEAVE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO IMPROVING CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THIS. PEOPLE IN THOSE FACILITIES ARE SAFE AND THAT THE CONDITIONS MEET CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. AND TO DO THAT WORK- WE ARE IN THE PRISONS WELL PRIOR TO COVE AND- WE'RE IN THE PRISONS OR JAILS VIRTUALLY EVERY WEEK- MOST MILD. MUCH OF OUR WORK INVOLVES INSPECTING THE CONDITIONS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS COURT DECREES- AND- ALSO INTERNAL REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. PART OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN- TO INVESTIGATE CONDITIONS IN COUNTY JAILS. AND AS THE AGENDA SETS FORTH- ELEVEN COUNTIES HAVE BEEN SUED BY US OR OTHER FIRMS SEEKING STATEWIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN CLASS ACTIONS IN FEDERAL COURT. BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS IN THE JAILS ARE- WAY BEYOND- CONSTITUTIONAL- MINIMUM PROOF THAT THE DSCC IS NOT EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHING WHAT I BELIEVE IT SHOULD IT'S CALL SHOULD BE. WHICH IS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND TO ENSURE THAT- THE CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTY JAILS TO MEET OUR STANDARDS SET FORTH WHAT MAKES STANDARDS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER LAWS- BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND OTHERS EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE THAT- MOST OF THE COUNTY JAILS. IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ONE CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS IN AT LEAST SOME RESPECTS EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT WE'VE INSPECTED WE FOUND SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND I DOUBT THAT THAT'S- HEY ABNORMAL SITUATION. SO- IN TERMS OF THAT WHAT THE BSE SEES ROLE IS AND WHAT IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST I CAN SAY- AMPLIFY WHAT- THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE HINTED AT BEFORE WHICH IS THAT THE REGULATIONS DRAFTED BY THE B. SEC- ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL- THEY ARE. THE REGULATIONS AND OFTEN REQUIRE JUST A WRITTEN POLICY- THEY NEED TO BE INSTEAD THEY NEED TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AND SET FORTH MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WHICH THEY DO NOT DO FOR EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES- SECTION ONE OH FIVE THREE REQUIRES A POLICY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION WHICH IS A EUPHEMISM FOR SOLITARY CONFINEMENT-THAT REGULAR. DOESN'T SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWERS WHICH CAN RESULT IN PLACE ANOTHER PERSON IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HOW LONG HERE SHE- SHOULD BE IN THAT SITUATION IT DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR THE EXCLUSION- PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS FROM BEING HOUSED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AS IS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION. AND DOESN'T REQUIRE- AND DOESN'T REQUIRE. WRITTEN REGULATIONS ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY CAN GET OUT OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SECTION TWELVE ELEVEN WHICH MERELY STATES THAT THERE SHALL BE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE DAILY SICK CALL CONDUCTED FOR ALL INMATES WERE PROVISION MADE THAT ANY INMATE REQUESTING MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ATTENTION BE GIVEN SIX TENSION. HERE AGAIN THERE ARE NO DETAILS- THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT WHO SHE CONDUCTS THE CALL HOUSE THE CALLS REQUEST SHOULD BE PROCESSED. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CLINICIAN TO SPEAK WITH THE PATIENT MUCH LESS A TIME FRAME IN WHICH A REFERRAL SHOULD BE MADE DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE COMPLAINT ALL OF THESE THINGS. ARE REQUIRED I BELIEVE BY THE CONSTITUTION. AND THE REGULATIONS DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO PROVIDING THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY. SECONDLY THE DSCC PROCESS HASN'T WORKED VERY WELL BECAUSE THE JAILS NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE DATA TO SHOW. AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH REQUIREMENT. THIRD- THE INSTRUCTIONS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM I'M NEVER SEEN ONE BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY LOOK AT WRITTEN POLICIES AND I TAKE CARE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S WORD FOR IT THAT THEY- WALK AROUND THE INSTITUTION AND- TALK TO PEOPLE BUT I. DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL IN ORDER TO- DETERMINE ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE JAIL AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CORRECT THEM. TO DO THAT THE INSPECTORS HAVE TO REVIEW LOTS OF RECORDS INTERVIEW STAFFS MAYBE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN THE JAILS. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE POLICIES. YOU ARE ACTUALLY. BEING FOLLOWED AND PROVIDE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT IMPORTANT GOSH DEFICIENCIES IN THEM THE SEC PROCESSES BEEN ALLUDED TO BY THAT- PRIOR PANELISTS AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THERE ARE REALLY NO DIRECT CONSEQUENCES BESIDES SHOWING UP AT A MEETING OF THE BOARD- FOR. NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE INADEQUATE REGULATIONS- THIS IS- WITHOUT SOME CONSEQUENCES IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THESE SHARES IN THE COUNTY'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE POOR CONDITIONS AND THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY. WHICH I THINK HAS RESULTED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS THAT WE'VE DISCOVERED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. AND THE OTHER- ISSUE ABOUT THE INSPECTIONS IS AS I UNDERSTAND THE INSPECTORS ARE OR- ARE NOT. EXPERTS SUCH AS PHYSICIANS- WE ROUTINELY AND IT SAID IT WOULD BE IN MY VIEW- I'M NOT PRACTICE NOT TO EMPLOY. EXPERTS IN SUBJECT MATTER AREAS DURING THE INSPECTIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- CERTAIN THINGS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE FOR EXAMPLE AND MEDICAL CARE TO VALUATE THE MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM YOU NEED TO HAVE. A PHYSICIAN. FOR A NURSE AND OR A NURSE- EVALUATE WHETHER THE PATIENTS ARE GETTING APPROPRIATE CARE AND I DON'T THINK THAT SIDE AS WELL REALLY NOT AN EASY PROCESS TO CHANGE THE POLICIES PROCEDURES AND IN SOME CASES THE CULTURE OF- CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME CERTAINLY SIXTY DAYS THIS. WAY IS VERY INADEQUATE OUR- OUR CONSENT DECREES LAST YEAR'S- NOT DAYS OR OUR MINDS- IT TAKES CONSTANT OVERSIGHT IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES DEDICATION. A DEDICATED ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS BY BOTH THE INSPECTORS AND- THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY IT TAKES A WILLINGNESS TO CHANGE AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY- IT TAKES IT USUALLY TAKES MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND IN EVERY CASE THAT WE'VE HAD AGAINST THE COUNTY JAIL THAT'S BEEN THE CASE- WITHOUT. WITHOUT OUR- ADVOCACY AND LITIGATION- IS THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE COUNTIES NOT TO PROVIDE- THE MONEY IT TAKES RISKS SAY FOR EXAMPLE HEALTH CARE IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO. NEED APPROPRIATE- CLINICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. SO I BELIEVE THAT ARE ROLLED OUT OF THE PRISON LAW OFFICE IN THE STATE HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE- AND SUMMERS IN SOME LIMITED RESPECTS THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE BSE C. SHOULD PROPERLY BE PERFORMING- AND THAT SETTING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER LAWS SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT. AND RIGOROUSLY MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE STANDARDS- IT SEEMS TO ME HAT THE STATE HAS A CHOICE IT CAN IMPROVE THE B. SEC REGULATORY PRACTICE. AND I WOULD AGREE THAT- THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR ARE A GOOD FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. OR I CAN MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO- WHICH WILL MEAN THAT MORE COUNTIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE SO. I VERY MUCH URGE. YOU ALL TO. HE HAD SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MADE BEFORE SPECIALLY- MAKING SURE THAT THE REPRESENTATION. AND- ON THE BOARD- IS MORE BALANCED THAN IT IS NOW WE'VE HAD. CETERA. FIVE FIFTY YEARS AGO WE TRIED TO GET SOME AGREEMENTS WITH SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON SOME OF THE MORE PRESSING ISSUES IN THE JAILS- ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THE- THE SEC REGULATIONS AND- SO- CORRECT. THOSE CONDITIONS DIDN'T IMPROVE UNTIL WE- INSTITUTED LEGAL ACTION AND ARE UNLESS THE- REGULATORY. FRAMEWORK IS STRENGTHENED- I DON'T THINK THEY WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPECTER- GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND ALSO FOR BEING HERE. NEXT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM A. D. LEWIS WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. HELLO MISTER LEWIS. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING US MY NAME IS ETIENNE I'M AN ATTORNEY AND A DISPLAY- IT'S CALIFORNIA I WORK ON CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT ISSUES I'VE FOUND AT OUR TRANS ADVOCACY PROJECT WHICH FOCUSES ON ISSUES THAT TRANS NON BINARY AND INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES FACE MARXISM. PART OF THIS WORK I ALSO WORKED IN GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT INCLUDING AS A PERFORMANCE. THE LOCAL LEVEL I'M INCLUDING OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THOROUGHFARE ALONG GRAND HERE SEE WHAT THE AUTHORITY TO ACCESS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE DISABILITY. R. C. HAS USED ITS ACCESSORY TO MONITOR AND INVESTIGATE JAILS ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR CASES AND JAILS IN SACRAMENTO IT'S HAMPER COUNTIES AMONG OTHERS AND WE BRIEFLY I'M SITTING AT WORK OTHER COUNTIES INCLUDING SAN DIEGO AND PRESTO. THIS WORK WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW JAILS CRIMINALLY AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE GELS ARE TEAMING PLACE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES RANGING FROM DIABETES DIABETES TO SLEEP APNEA TO THOSE WHO USE WHEELCHAIRS AND CANES AND SEPARATION AND HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS. WITH LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING SOCIAL INTERACTION EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR ADEQUATE MENTAL AND MEDICAL CARE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SHELL SYSTEMS WITH THIS SO I'M CONSTRUCTION AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FROM ACCESSING SUCH PROGRAMS MEDICAL CARE AN INTEGRATED HOUSING CENTERS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN JAILS OUT OF PROVIDE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION TO DEATH AND THE VISUALS AND TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OUR WORK WE'VE WITNESSED HOW TO SPELL HOW PEOPLE DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY BLACK MY NEXT PEOPLE ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN HOW DETENTION CONDITIONS ARE DISABLING AND ABOUT THEMSELVES INCARCERATION RESULTS AND MORE NEW MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES. LIKE PTSD ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION CURSORY SHOULD ALSO SERIOUSLY EXACERBATE EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. LIKE TRIGGER MANIC EPISODES AND EXACERBATING. PARANOID OR DELUSIONAL SOMETIMES AS MANY CLICKS THESE COMMENTS WERE PRACTICES. WE WERE THAT THIS MIGHT SHIFT ARE NOT. YES THE C. OVERSIGHT WILL BE A MINIMAL UTILITY UNLESS AND UNTIL IT CONSIDERS THE CONTEXT WHICH INCARCERATION EXPRESSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A REMARKABLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA JAILS ARE RECEIVING OR ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. SERVICES AND SITE JAIL SHOULD NOT EXIST ON A SEPARATE PAYMENT FROM THE CURRENT SERVICES BEING PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE FOR DECADES NOW. AND THIS DIFFERENCE IS A MAJOR REASON WHY WE SEE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER DISABILITIES CYCLING IN AND OUT OF INCARCERATION JAILS PRISONS ETCETERA AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION INCLUDING PSYCHIATRIC. FACILITIES HOSPITALS. THE SHERMANS RESPECT UNDERSTAND. INSIDE OF A TEAM IN THE SEC STANDARDS AS THEY CURRENTLY EXIST. FALL SHORT OF LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR JUST THE SUN'S CONSISTENTLY DEVELOPING CASE LAW. THAT IS THE SAME AS FOR JOE CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES THAT WORK AND HELP THE TEAM IN THE SEC GUIDANCE. RANGING FROM OUT OF CELL TIME TO PROGRAM ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TELL THE GUY TELL SYSTEM TOWARDS THE GOAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM STANDARDS. AND NOT TELL YOUR HURTS EVERYONE. IT'S ONE REASON WHY DRC KELLERMAN OTHER ADVOCATES HOW TO STEP INTO THE BREACH SOMEBODY GET CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT IN JAIL SO OFTEN. OUR STATE STANDARDS IN BSE SICK I ANSWERED OVERSIGHT- LACKING JUST SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY SET UP MY LIFE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE IN CUSTODY. AS SUCH CENTERS ALSO PROVIDE COVER TO COUNTIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN D. R. C. PUBLISHED REPORT ON CITY OR COUNTY JAILS. THE RESPONSE ARE IMPORTANT FINDINGS SAN DIEGO COUNTY USES COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE THIRTEEN STANDARDS AS A SHIELD AGAINST OUR FINDINGS. MANY OF WHICH ARE RESONATE NEAR THE CITY AUDITOR'S RECENT FINDINGS ON THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM AS WELL. SEVEN SHORT WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP AND PUBLISH SPECIFIC TYPES OF METRICS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOCAL COUNTIES ARE LIMITING THEIR RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION AND ATTENTION. WE RECOMMEND IT TO SAY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. COMING UP WITH ATTRACTIVE SINGLES TO LIMIT THE USE OF JAILS- FIRST THE STATE COULD REQUIRE OVERSIGHT BODIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOCAL COUNTIES ARE EFFECTIVELY LIMITING SHOW YOU. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENSIVE DATA CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY THE SEC. C. C. COULD ALSO COLLECT DATA TO MEASURE WHETHER COUNTIES ARE DETAINING RESIDENTS THAT COULD BE BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY OTHER COUNTIES PRACTICES JUST LIKE IMPACT BLACK AND BLACK AND WHITE NEXT UNITIES PEOPLE DISABILITIES. LGBTQ PEOPLE ESPECIALLY TRANS PEOPLE HE SAYS HE COULD COLLECT DATA MEASURING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CYCLING IN AND OUT OF JAILS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS BUT THAT SHORT TIME KOREANS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU'RE A FINDERS. AND DISAGREE SUCH INFORMATION BY RACE DISABILITY LANGUAGE AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. DSCC CAN ALSO COLLECT DATA RELATING TO THE EXISTENCE AND EFFICACY OF PROGRAMS INTENDED TO DIVERT PEOPLE FROM JAIL PARTICULAR PROGRAMS FIND IT AT THE- INTER SUBZERO ONE AND TWO OF THE FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION SEQUENTIAL. INTERCEPT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR AND- OF PROCEEDING AND INSTEAD OF AN ALTERNATE DISPOSITION TO ESPECIALLY COURT. SECOND BCC COMMEMORATES PANDEMIC RELATED DATA TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR JOHN REDUCTION FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS. THIRD THE SEC CAN ALSO TRACK AN ESCAPED MAJOR INCIDENTS LIKE DOESN'T BECAUSE THE SEXUAL SALTS USE THE FORCE. AS WELL THOUGHT AND USE OF FORCE AND GENERAL SETTINGS ESPECIALLY THE USE OF OC SPRAY. HI PARTICULARLY CONCERNING JURISDICTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL MONITORING AND SUPERVISION. THE FOURTH. AND WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP MORE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO REQUIRE INSPECTIONS JUST ASK ON THE GROUND CONDITIONS WHEN A MORE REGULAR BASIS THIS IS NECESSARILY MORE CHALLENGING AND ASSESSING WHETHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HOW COMPLIANT POLICIES. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE ASSESSING CONDITIONS ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF EFFECTIVE AND ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. WE UNDERSTAND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE OHIO. AUDITOR ALONG WITH PLO. IN SHORT IS YOUR SYSTEM THAT SHOWED THAT THE STATE SHOULD ENHANCE ITS OVERSIGHT OVER LOCAL CHANNELS WITH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING JURISDICTIONS RELIANCE ON JAILING. A SERVICE VISIT PRESENTER INSTITUTIONS OVERSIGHT SHOULD NOT NOT EXCESS TELLEMENT GEL SPINACH LIABILITY TO THE COVER OF REGULATORY PRESENT PROVISIONS. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT DISABILITIES DESERVE NO LESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LEWIS. AND FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM JOHN LINDSAY POLAND WITH THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE. MR POLAND. TESTING IN AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS JOHN LINDSAY POLAND CORRECT CALIFORNIA HEARING JUSTICE PROGRAM OF AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE A QUAKER PEACE AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN WE CO AUTHORED AND WITH A WIDE COALITION OF COMMUNITY GROUPS ADVOCATED FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY'S CAREFIRST JAILS LAST POLICY ADOPTED LAST YEAR. THIS POLICY LACKS RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT WOULD HELP KEEP MENTALLY ILL FOLKS OUT OF JAIL. INSTEAD JAIL STAFF HAS GROWN IN RESPONSE TO WHAT'S KNOWN AS A BAD- LITIGATION. ALAMEDA COUNTY'S SANTA RITA JAIL HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF IN CUSTODY DEATHS IN THE BAY AREA A HIGHER NUMBER THAN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OF JAILS IN THE STATE WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND COURSE REDID PERSONS SANTA RITA JAIL HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UN SENTENCED INDIVIDUALS 94% ACCORDING TO TOM TELL ME ABOUT IT WHO IS INCARCERATED AND ONE OF THE JAILS MENTAL HEALTH UNITS. QUOTE THE WAY THE JAIL IS ORGANIZED THE CULTURE OF THE INSTITUTION AND THE ATTITUDE OF DEPUTIES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS RESPONDED TO LITIGATION WITH INCREASED JAIL STAFF AND FUNDING. WHICH COINCIDED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED NEED FOR COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. OVER A HUNDRED PRISONERS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BARBER CONSENT DECREE. AND DOES AN EDIBLE FOOD AND RECENT INCREASES IN FOOD COMMISSARY PRICES HAVE LED THE HUNGER STRIKES. FAMILIES OF SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE ARE CAMPED OUT ON THE COUNTY BILLED THE COUNTY BUILDING DEMANDING FUNDS FOR HOSPITALS INSTEAD OF JAILS. WE'RE IN A CRISIS. ARRESTED INCARCERATION BUT NOT CONVICTION ARE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POOR MENTAL HEALTH. INCREASED COUNTY FUNDS FOR JAIL STAFF HAS UNDERMINED ITS CAPACITY TO FUND THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT HELP PREVENT INCARCERATION ARE LESS HARMFUL THAN JAIL ARE INCREASINGLY NEEDED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT BY FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS ON LIKE JAIL BASED STAFF. WHAT ABOUT- SETTLEMENT ASSUME TERMS ASSUME THAT MORE CUSTODY ALL STAFFED PRIMARILY SHERIFF DEPUTIES WILL ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE JAIL. THE ASSESSMENT REQUIRES ALAMEDA COUNTY TO HIRE MORE THAN THREE TIMES AS MANYNEW SHERIFF'S STAFF AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STUFF SHARE STAFF IS UNLIKELY TO DEEPLY EXACERBATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROBLEMS IN THE JAIL. ONE EXPERT IN THE BIBLE THAT OCCASION WROTE THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF EVALUATING IN CUSTODY DEATHS AND WHAT WOULD PREVENT THEM. THIS LACK OF INSTRUCTOR INTROSPECTION HAS PER PROVED DEADLY. MORE SHARE STAFF DOES NOT COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH STAFF. YET NO STRATEGIES FOR PROVIDING CONSTITUTIONAL LEVELS OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN JAIL OR EVEN REFERENCED IN THE BIBLE DECREE. COUNTY BUDGETS LIKE- ALL ACROSS THE STATE COVER SERVICES BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN JAILS BUT ALAMEDA COUNTY LIKE OTHER COUNTIES MAKES POLICY AND BUDGETS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THE JAIL SEPARATELY FROM THE CARE AND SERVICES NEEDED OUTSIDE THE GYM. WHEN THE COUNTY IS SUED FOR POOR CONDITIONS IN THE JAIL AND MEASURES TO DENVER OR DIVERT ARRESTS IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTSIDE THE JAIL AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEHIND BARS ARE NOT ON THE TABLE. ONLY CONDITIONS IN JAIL ARE. STATE FUNDING FOR BSE SEE ANYTHING MORE STATE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. AND INFLUENCE THIS BALKANIZATION OF SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND MENTAL ILLNESS THE PLACE IS CLEAN RESOURCES FOR DETAILS ABOUT HOUSING HOSPITALS AND OTHER SERVICES OUTSIDE THE JAIL. TRANSPARENCY OF GEL EXPENDITURES IS FUNDAMENTALLY LACKING. THE COUNTY HAS DEDICATED INCREASINGLY LARGE PORTIONS OF ITS GENERAL FUND TO ADDITIONAL CUSTODIAL AND CLINICAL STAFF IN THE JAIL- BUT THE NUMBER OF FUNDED VACANCIES AT THE JAIL HAS ONLY GROWN. IF THERE'S NO TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTING OF WHAT HAPPENS ON EXPENDED FUNDS ALLOCATED TO JAIL STAFF. NOR IS THERE ANY TRANSPARENT FUNGIBILITY OF AN EXPANDED FUNDS THAT COULD BE MOVED INTO BADLY NEEDED COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR THE SAME POPULATION OF SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY SPEND TIME IN THE JAIL AND SENTENCED. MANDATING THAT TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY IS URGENTLY NEEDED. IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU JUST HEARD THE SEC COULD MANDATE AND SOME DEVICE PRETRIAL ASSESSMENTS AND RELEASE THAT BOOKING DISCHARGE PLANNING MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT BODY BOOKING METHADONE TREATMENT OVERSIGHT OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM TIME PEOPLE IN JAIL GET. THERE IS NOT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF HOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ARE SPENT AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SPENT ON. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE SEC FINES HAVE NOT IMPROVED OUTCOMES FORGET IT CONDITIONS INSIDE PREVENTED DEATHS OR IMPROVE RETENTION. IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF REFORMS TO BE S. YOU SEE ONLY RESULTED IN MORE RESOURCES FOR JAILS TO IMPROVING THE STATE OF JAILS INSTEAD OF THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IN THEM. I URGE YOU TO MANDATE ACCOUNTABILITY HOLISTICALLY. IN WAYS THAT DON'T JUST POUR MORE FUNDS INTO JAILS AND THE STRUCTURES THAT OPERATE THEM. BUT IT JUST NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT PROMOTE HEALING AND PREVENT FURTHER INCARCERATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR THANK YOU MR POLAND PRE SHAPE YOUR TIME BEING WITH US TODAY- THAT'S THE END OF OUR PANEL- I JUST WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO. OUR COLLEAGUES HERE YES SENATOR CURTIS. THANK YOU MINIATURE- I JUST WANNA I'VE BEEN TELLING MYSELF TO JUST FOCUS ON KEEPING THEM. MIKE COMMENT COMMENTS IN QUESTION CONCISE HERE BECAUSE- I WRITE HERE IS SORT OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW. JUST BARELY OVER A YEAR AGO FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. HELLO I'M IN A- HAVE BEEN IMMERSED IN THESE ISSUES- ON THE LOCAL JAIL SEEN FIRST HAND FOR A LONG TIME. THAT SAID- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRISONERS I THINK EVERYONE WHO PRESENTED- THUS FAR IN THIS PANEL- HAD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT SHOULD BE. PURSUED- THAT SAID- I AGREE MOST WITH THE LAST PRISONER. HELLO JOHN LINDSAY POLAND HOME BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT WE'RE STILL TREATING. OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES- ON A CRIMINAL PLATFORM. IN I THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA ALONE IS GUILTY OF I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN GOING ON SINCE ALEXANDER THE GREAT- BUT- THE CALIFORNIA COULD BE THE FIRST DATE. THAT MAKES THE SHIFT TO TREATING MEDICAL ISSUES HAS MEDICAL ISSUES AND CRIMINAL ISSUES AS CRIMINAL ISSUES. IN OUR COUNTY- HELLO IS MR PROSPECTOR KNOWS A CAME IN AND- AND I THINK ULTIMATELY DID. A GOOD THING IN TERMS OF OPENING UP. THE TRANSPARENCY AROUND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE JAILS. PART WAY THROUGH PILLOWS ANALYSIS WITH THE DEATH OF. A YOUNG MAN NAMED MICHAEL TYREE WHO WAS IN JAIL ACCORDING TO THE JUDGE WHO REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION- IN THERE WERE NO BEDS PUTTING HIM IN JAIL WAS OPENED AND PUT HIM ON THE STREET ON A SHORT TERM BASIS. INITIAL OPENLY WASN'T EQUIPPED NUMBER ONE TO DEAL WITH HIM. IN HIS CONDITION AND NUMBER TWO. IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE- THE GUARDS THEMSELVES WERE WERE SENTENCED ON THAT WAS UNPREDICTABLE SENTENCED FOR MURDER IN THAT CASE. BUT WHAT'S WHAT WAS PREDICTABLE I THINK IS AFFECTED IN A JAIL SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE BOARD WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT WORK. 49% IN IN OUR SYSTEM. OF CURRENT CENSUS OF TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED IN THE JAILS DOWN THERE FORTY NINE PERCENT. ARE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES UP UPON INTAKE- IN THE COUNTY STILL STRUGGLING I THINK TO. COMPORT WITH THE CONSENT DECREE THAT WAS. SECURED BY PRISON OFFICE- BUT WAS EVEN MORE STRIKING IS. THAT AND I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE LAST PRISONER I THINK OUR STATE SYSTEM IS STILL GEARED. TOWARD FUNDING AND REIMBURSING WEEK WE DEALT WITH THAT- WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT HERE IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- THIS FOCUS ON ON FINDING. A CREAM HELLO GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOMEONE TO BUILD ADDITIONAL JAIL SPACE- TO DEAL WITH. THE CENTURY BOTH POPULATIONS- CRIMINAL UNDYED MOST POPULATION IN THIS POPULATION THAT. I WOULD SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THERE BECAUSE HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR TOOL DIAGNOSED WITH FROM OTHER BUILDER HOPING HERE HEALTH ISSUES. LIKE DRUG ALCOHOL- SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YEAH I HEARD AND APPRECIATED ASSISTED EVERYONE. WHO SPOKE. IN DISABILITY RIGHTS STARTED GOING DOWN THIS PATH OF I THOUGHT OF. YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD. COULD PUT SOME MORE SIGNIFICANT GUIDELINES IN PLACE- WHEN I LOOK AT BSE SEE HERE THE REPORT SAYS THAT IF WE INCREASED. YOU KNOW JUST RECENTLY AS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS SO THAT INSPECTIONS COULD BE DONE AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AND I DON'T KNOW I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT THE CAPACITY OF BSE SEE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- SORT OF JUST CHASING OUR TAILS OF WE'RE GONNA SAY PSEC NEEDS TO DO MORE AND THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE. MORE GUIDELINES AND- IN A FEW MORE SEATS ON THE BOARD AND- IN THEY JUST THEY JUST NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION WHEN THEY'RE DOING THESE INSPECTIONS. OF THE ONLY HAVE. ANOTHER PEOPLE TO DO ONE INSPECTION A YEAR. WITH WIND CHILL CONDITIONS ARE THIS BAD. IT THEN THE MODEL ITSELF IS A FAILURE IN IT AGAIN I DON'T CRITICIZE I'M NOT CRITICIZING PSEC IN THE LEADERSHIP THERE I'M SAYING THIS THIS MODEL WAS SET UP IN A WAY OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. TO COME ANYWHERE NEAR THE OVERSIGHT NEEDED FOR THE PROBLEM I THINK WE'RE HEARING THAT TODAY BUT- ARE WE JUST GONNA SORT OF. WAIT AND SEE IF THESE FOURTEEN POSITIONS TURN THE WHOLE SYSTEM AROUND. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO DO IT. IN IN A CERTAIN CITY DISABILITY RIGHTS YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT GUIDELINES AS A WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD COULD GUIDE. A TRANSITION TOWARD REDUCING CAR SERRATION HOW ABOUT FUNDING IN OUR GREATESTPOWER IS. IS THE BUDGET HERE AND- THE END IT WOULD POSE A QUESTION I JUST THE MONKS OR COLLEAGUES AND YOU COULD TAKE IT AS A RHETORICAL QUESTION FOR NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE WILL RESPOND TO IT- I THINK. MR LINDSAY POLAND HAS ALREADY RESPONDED TO A DEFENSE BUT WHY AREN'T WE HI WHY ARE WE SHIFTING BUDGET DOLLARS IS QUICKLY AND A SIGNIFICANT WE SEE AS WE CAN THAT WOULD GO DOWNSTREAM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT CENTERS INSTEAD OF JAILS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- IN WHY WOULDN'T WE DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY COULD TO DIS INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES. LIKE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAS JUST APPROVED ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED BED. ALL TEN MILLION DOLLAR JAIL. FOR A POPULATION THAT IS ALMOST 50% MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS- IT'S AUTOMATICALLY AN ADA VIOLATION I THINK TO TREAT SOMEONE FOR A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION IN A JAIL HEY I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND THAT. SO- ANYWAY I GUESS AS THEY SAY THAT'S HOW I REALLY FEEL- BUT GIVEN THAT WE'RE A BUDGET COMMITTEE I DID WANT TO JUST PUT THIS LARGER ISSUE OUT THERE I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S- THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. WHAT ARE WE DOING OR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO- TO DRAMATICALLY SHIFT FUNDING TO REALLY REPRESENT- THE POPULATION. OR IF YOU WORK WITH THE INTAKE OF THE POPULATION THE INTAKE OF THE GILLS NOW A BLESSING I WANTED TO SAY WAS RELATIVE TO. THE EXAMPLE OF MY OWN HOME COUNTY. THE NUMBERS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT SANTA RITA LETTER I REFERENCED IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. FROM THE C. O. O. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY MCGILL MARK AS A SERVICE OF TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED JILL CENSUS IN OUR OWN COUNTY RIGHT NOW- THE MAJORITY HAVE BEEN THERE. FOR ELEVEN MONTHS AWAITING. AWAITING A COURT DATE AWAITING A COURT DATE OF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT BACK TO THE PERCENTAGE THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS BASICALLY. TWELVE HUNDRED OF THEM WITHIN THE PERCENTAGES ARE RIGHT HALF OF THOSE TWELVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- STUCK IN JAIL CELLS AWAITING A COURT APPEARANCE- YOU KNOW IT IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE BUT IT ALSO HE ALSO SAID THAT IF YOU READ REMOVE THE BACKLOG THEY'D ONLY BE FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS LEFT INCARCERATED IN THE ADULT IN THE INTERREGIONAL SYSTEM SO- WELL. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THESE. THESE ISSUES THESE ISSUES ARE INTERTWINED AND I THINK UNTIL WE START BUILDING SEPARATE FACILITIES. FOR THE FOLKS WHO NEED HEALTH CARE- BUT I JUST DON'T SPELL JUST I THINK WE'RE NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES. UNTIL WE DO THAT ANYWAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNISTIC FOR A FEW MINUTES SENATOR I THINK THE- PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SHARED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL- IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. CENTER NEWMAN ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IT'S A LOT A LOT TOO LET'S. BUT LIKE TO TAKE IN- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR- THE POLAND. HELLO I'M SORRY WITH MISTER SPECTER- DID YOU HAVE I DIDN'T HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAD ANY SPECIFIC- PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF. BUT ARE THERE ANY FOCUSED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD MAKE TO US. IF HE'S STILL ON. CLICK IT LET ME NOT BE. MAYBE WE CAN ASK HIM TO STAY ON. OKAY. SHE. WITH RESPECT- IF YOU'RE STILL ON MAYBE ON MUTE- I'M SOME SORRY COULD. I WAS A DISTRACTED FOR A MOMENT IS THERE A QUESTION I AM WRITING I JUST HAD A QUESTION IF YOU HAD ANY- SPECIFIC. PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD MAKE TO US. WELL ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH- THE CONSULTANT'S REPORT- AND I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER PANELISTS- I THINK IN ORDER OF PRIORITY I THINK. YOU CAN'T. DO ANYTHING WITHOUT DECENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO THAT REGULATIONS- I THINK WE REALLY NEED A LOT OF WORK- THEY NEED THEY NEED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN BOTH THE OPERATIONS OF JAILS AND ALSO EXPERTISE AND- CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS AND THEN AND- ALSO EXPERTISE IN THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT TO HELP THE BSE CITY DRAFT DECENT REGULATIONS WE- HAVE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE TRIED TO GET. REGULATED WE TRIED TO AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATIONS WHEN THEY WERE BEING REVIEWED IN TERMS OF- THE THERE ARE REGULATIONS ON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR OUR PROPOSALS WAS REJECTED. NO I DON'T BLAME OF COURSE THE CURRENT BORDER OR MISS HOWARD AT ALL BUT SINCE SHE WASN'T THERE BUT- UNTIL THE REGULATIONS GET- IMPROVED AND THEY GET SPECIFIC- THEN THEY CAN'T MONITOR ANYTHING. SO THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST PRIORITY IN THE SECOND PRIORITY WOULD BE TO MATTER EXPERTS INVOLVED IN BOTH THE INSPECTION PROCESS AND THE- REGULATORY PROCESS OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HOWARD OR WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO RESPOND TO. ANY OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE JUST HEARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR THIS IS KATIE HOWARD I'M GONNA MENTION A FEW THINGS AND THEN ASK MY COLLEAGUE ALLISON- TO PLEASE CHIME IN AS WELL. UNDER MR SPECTER'S MOST RECENT COMMENTS WE HAVE A VERY PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO ON REGULATION REVISIONS- WE ALWAYS REQUEST SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO PARTICIPATE ALLISON CAN. READILY PULL UP THE NAMES AND AFFILIATIONS THAT THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO PARTICIPATED ON OUR LAST EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT. JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED OUR BOARD APPROVED. REVISED REGULATIONS IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THEY'RE NOW GOING THROUGH THAT- STERNBACH PROCESS- AND ARE. ABOUT TO BE FINALIZED- I KNOW IN SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY- I DON'T REPORT ON SAN DIEGO- TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE DETAILS IN THE REGULATION. YOU CHECKS- THERE WAS SOME ADDITIONAL- SPECIFICITY ADDED IN THE LAST UPDATE TO THAT REGULATION- JUST TO. MAKE IT MORE CLEAR AND I THINK THAT THAT THE PRACTICE OUT CLEARLY IS THAT IT'S IT IS THE JOB IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERSON DOING THE SAME TO CHAT. TO BE DETERMINING THAT THE PERSON IS ALIVE HE GETS INTO A HOLE I MEAN I'LL JUST MENTION THIS BRIEFLY I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO GET OVERLY OVERLY GRANULAR BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN LITIGATION IN THE PAST- CONCERNING PEOPLE BEING WOKEN UP. DURING THE NIGHT YOU KNOW MULTIPLE TIMES AS PART OF A SAFETY CHECK TO DETERMINE THAT PEOPLE ARE ALIVE I MEAN YOU HAVE TO FIND A BALANCED. AND REASONABLE SPOT TO LAND. PURPOSE OF THIS FEATURE IS. THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE FACILITY AND BATS RACE I JUST MENTION DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING. WE BELIEVE STANDS FOR IS A LOT. IS NOT IN DISTRESS IS NOT HAVING A MEDICAL ISSUE OR ANY OTHER METHOD MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT COULD NEED IMMEDIATE. ATTENTION SO- I WOULD SAY. FIRST COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ARE WE ABSOLUTELY WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATES TO OUR REGULATIONS. ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS MISTER SPECTER TALKED ABOUT WAS THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE INSPECTIONS THEMSELVES. AND IT COMES TO THE DELIVERY OF THE HEALTH CARE OF THE JAILS IT I THE COUNTY HEALTH. DEPARTMENT THAT CONDUCTS AN ANNUAL INSPECTION SO. SOME OF THE OF THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED- HERE TODAY DOESN'T SQUARE. WITH ACTUAL PRACTICE. THE OTHER THING- THERE THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE SHOULD SAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR ONE OTHER ITEM OF CONFUSION WE DID INCLUDE THIS IN OUR- OUR RESPONSE LETTER TO THE AUDIT. I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR HAS A MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN IT SAYS THAT THE CDC ARE REGULATIONS. ON SAFETY CHECKS REQUIRES THE PERSON DOING THE INSPECTION TO DETERMINE THAT THE PERSON IS ALIVE. THE SPECIFIC CITATION THAT THEY MADE COMES FROM THE CDC OUR OPERATIONS MANUAL. AND THAT SECTION IS NOT PERTAINING TO SAFETY CHECKS INSTEAD IT'S PERTAINING TO DOING AN ACTUAL COUNT. OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN FACILITY AND IT'S A REGULATION THAT SAYS. THAT THEY ARE TO COUNT BOTH LIVING BREATHING INDIVIDUALS AND SOME OF THE STUFF IS REALLY. HARSH TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T COUNT DEAD PEOPLE IN THE POPULATION YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE SAFETY CHECK. SO OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY DIFFICULT SET OF ISSUES- THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES I WANTED TO MENTION A THOUSAND IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND- TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON OUR LAST MANY. SURE THANK YOU KATIE I'LL JANNEY WITH YES SEE OUR LAST REGULATION RIGHT- EXECUTIVE STEERING. WE OUTSIDE- WITH A VARIETY OF LIVED EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY COMMUNITY. ADVOCACY INCLUDING AN ATTORNEY FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HAD- A COUNTY COUNCIL MEMBER WE ALSO HAD A PERSON WHO WORKS IN CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE AND A PERSON WHO WORKS IN SH CORRECTIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE SO WE DID COVER THOSE- AREAS OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THAT THE REGULATION REVISION PROCESS. AND JUST TO ECHO- WHAT- KATIE TALKED ABOUT IS THAT- D. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTY HEALTHDEPARTMENT CONDUCT ANNUAL INSPECTIONS OF EACH PLACE OF DETENTION CENTER WHICH IN OUR REGULATIONS WE HAVE A SECTION ON MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH WE HAVE A SECTION ON NUTRITIONAL HEALTH WE ALSO HAVE A SECTION. ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. AND SO SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM EACH OF THOSE THREE AREAS GO INTO THE DETENTION FACILITIES THEY INSPECT FOR THOSE PARTICULAR REGULATIONS AND ALSO ANY OPERATIONAL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT CROSS OVER- SO- THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION OR- OR SAFETY CELLS OR OTHER HIGH RISK AREAS SO- THOSE INSPECTIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED AND THEY ARE BEING CONDUCTED THE ANNUAL THE- ANNUAL EITHER REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THOSE TO. US AS PART OF OUR INSPECTION REPORTS. OKAY. IS THAT IT MAY MISS HOWARD. WELL I HAVE OKAY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANNA- ASKED LMAO WHAT OPTIONS DO INCARCERATED UP PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE FOR RAISING. ISSUES ABOUT JAIL CONDITIONS ARE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE- ON LOCAL INSPECTOR GENERAL OR OVERSIGHT BOARDS. I BELIEVE THAT MOST COUNTIES IF NOT ALL WOULD OPERATE SOME FORM OF GRIEVANCE SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH- INMATES COULD FILE COMPLAINTS- THE DETAILS OF THAT WOULD BE- COULD VARY BY COUNTY- AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE SEC MAY HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON HOW THAT LOOKS IN PRACTICE- IT TO MAKE IT IN TERMS OF. RAISING ISSUES THAT I WOULD BE IN ORDER TO RAISE CONCERNS TO- THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS- IN THEIR COUNTY I HAD TO THE EGGS IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO HOW PEOPLE CAN RAISE CONCERNS TO THE SEC OR TO THE STATE MARK BRADLEY- THERE ISN'T AS FAR AS I'VE- EVER COME ACROSS AN OFFICIAL INTAKE SYSTEM FOR. THE SEC TO RECEIVE REPORTED STANDARD VIOLATIONS ARE CONCERNS- FROM INMATES OR THEIR FAMILIES- THE- AS YOU WILL RECALL THERE IS A- OMBUDSPERSON- BEING. DEVELOPED ON THE JUVENILE SIGN WHICH COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR- FOR SUCH A SYSTEM OUR- OPERATE WITH RESPECT TO ADULT LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES- BUT- HAVE TO BE SEC COULDN'T SPEAK TOWARD- SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL UNLESS I DO KNOW THAT- FAMILIES TEND TO COLIN TO BE SEC MEETINGS TO EXPRESS CONCERNS AND- JUST FROM MY OWN OBSERVATION- AS WELL AS- SUBMITTING. INFORMATION TO- THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEES AND WORKING GROUPS THAT ARE REVISING THE STANDARDS SO THERE IS A PROCESS FOR IN TAKING. COMMENT PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THAT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION WELL MAYBE MISS HOWARD COULD ANSWER. IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU SAID. YES I JUST WANT TO BESURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF YOUR QUESTION SENATOR I BELIEVE YOU SAID WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR A PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED OR FAMILY MEMBERS TO RAISE CONDUCT CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE LOCAL LOCAL. AND I WILL- ASK ALAN SAID TO ADD TO THIS BUT- EACH AND EVERY FACILITY DOES HAVE SOME SORT OF A GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE- AND- YOU CAN'T LAND IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE HEAR EXTENSIVELY AND OUR MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PUBLIC INPUT AND LISTENING SESSIONS AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY. AN ISSUE DURING PARTICULARLY THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF THAT. CALL THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE HUGE CONCERNS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND CONCERNING REPORTS COMING OUT OF. JAIL FACILITIES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND ACCESS TO. HE P. IAN HOW COLD CASES WERE BEING ADDRESSED SO- WE CERTAINLY TOOK SOME ACTION STEPS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE KINDS OF CONCERNS COMING AND SO- WHERE THE BOARD CAN DO MORE WE CERTAINLY DO AND- THOUSAND WOULD YOU PLEASE ADD ON JUST IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT A PERSON CAN DO- WITH THE SORTS OF CONCERNS. SURE K. THANK YOU- CERTAINLY EVERY DETENTION FACILITY HAS A PROCESS FOR GRIEVANCES THEY ALSO HAVE PROCESS USED FOR- CITIZEN'S COMPLAINT IS THAT OUR NEXT TECHNICALLY USED. ON THOSE PROCESSES CAN BE FOUND ON EACH ARM AN AGENCY'S WEBSITE TYPICALLY AND THAT THE AGENCY HAS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THOSE- WHILE WE DON'T HAVE- AS MENTIONED A FORMAL PROCESS TO RECEIVE. COMPLAINTS FROM- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH- PRACTICES THAT FACILITIES WE DO GET THEM. AND WE DO RESPOND TO THEM- AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- BUT BUT- TYPICALLY IF PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS THEY GO THROUGH THE AGENCY IS- CITIZEN COMPLAINT PROCESS OR A PERSON HOUSED IN THE FACILITY WOULD GO. TO THE FACILITIES GRIEVANCE PROCESS. OKAY AND LAST WEEK WE MOVE ON- OF OUR PANELISTS I THINK EACH ONE OF THEM OF THAT SPOKE ABOUT THE NUMBER AND THE PERCENTAGE OF- INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WHO'LL HAVE MEANT ARE YOU KNOW HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS OF MENTAL. HEALTH ISSUES BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES. ARE THAT THE PERCENTAGE APPEARS TO BE GROWING IT OR IT'S ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES INSIDE THAT THEY NEED AND COULD ONLY GET WORSE. WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S SEEMS TO BE A VERY- COMMON ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY EVERYONE. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR WAS WITHOUT QUESTION TO THE PANEL YES I'M SORRY OKAY YOU TOO THIS IS KATIE HARD WITH THE BSE THIS. THE GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS MADE SOME PRETTY SIZEABLE INVESTMENTS IN IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO BETTER ADDRESS- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COUNTIES JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE- AS YOU'RE AWARE OVER THE LAST. TEN OR TWELVE YEARS OR SO- THERE THE STATE HAS MADE A FAIRLY SIZEABLE INVESTMENT IN. IMPROVEMENT OF JAIL FACILITIES- AND LAST YEAR. PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE JANUARY BUDGET BUDGET- WE WERE ASKED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT HAD BEEN RELINQUISHED BY COUNTIES THAT WERE NOT. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS PLANNED AND WAS I THINK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS IN ESSENCE ON THE TABLE WHAT THE GOVERNOR IN HIS PROPOSAL SWEPT THAT FINDING. AS PART OF A MUCH LARGER FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FACILITIES THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN PROCESS- IN THIS REGARD THAT I KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT BUT- WE CAN CERTAINLY PUT TOGETHER SOME INFORMATION AND FOLLOW UP FOR YOU. BECAUSE THAT THAT WORK IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE- THE CONCERNS ARE VERY LEGITIMATE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. ARE IN COUNTY JAILS AND WHERE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT ABLE TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED. AND IN ADDITION I GUESS I WOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THE SEC ADMINISTERS MANY DIFFERENT GRANTS AND- SOME OF THOSE GRANT PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS HAVE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON. DIVERSION PROGRAM SET THEN THE NAME IS OUT OF DATE AT THIS POINT BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS THAT MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT- EIGHTY LEWIS FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS COUNCIL WAS TALKING ABOUT IT SAID- SET MODEL IT'S A- DIVERSION. PROGRAM SO THERE CERTAINLY ARE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE INVESTED IN AND SOME. OF WHICH THE SEC HAS BEEN. AT OVER YEARS. THANK YOU FOR I WILL ON I JUST COMMENT THAT- BASED ON THE- TESTIMONY OF THE VARIOUS- PANELISTS WHO WERE HERE TODAY THEY CERTAINLY RAISE ALL THESE ISSUES OUT OF CARE AND CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF- THOSE WHO ARE IN THE FACILITIES. AND ALSO FOR THE STAFF OF THE FACILITIES BECAUSE NOBODY SHOULD FEEL THAT THEY'RE IN ANY KIND OF DANGER- WITH THE WITH THE CONDITIONS OUT THERE AND- SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED BECAUSE- THERE'S ALL THIS LITIGATION THAT HAPPENS WE END UP HAVING TO ADDRESS IT ANYWAY. HAVING TO CORRECT IT- AND YET. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I THINK THIS IS A LOT STRONGER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR LITIGATION TO DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND DRAMATIC TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS- WILL MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ISSUE TO. WHICH IS THE- CDC OURS MASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE AND WE WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT. A GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS DEAN MORGAN I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIISION WITHIN CDCR. I'D LIKE TO START BY- COMPLEMENTING VIA THE CONSULTANTS- WORK IN PUTTING THE AGENDA TOGETHER AGAIN- SUMMARIZING THE MASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORT. OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT- THE BEST PLAN ANNUAL PORT WHICH IS KNOWN BY THE ACRONYM EMPOWER ANNUALLY PROVIDES INFORMATION ON CURRENT PROJECTS RECENTLY COMPLETED PROJECTS AND PROJECTS ARE EITHER REQUESTING FUNDING FOR BUDGET YEAR OR BUT YOUR PLUS ONE. OF THEM ARE BECAUSE OF THIS FOCUS HAS NOT HISTORICALLY- CONTAIN A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT SHOWS LONG TERM NEEDS- AT OUR AT OUR PRISON SIT WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. I IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR REVIEW OF WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS MIGHT BE NEEDED OVER A LONGER TERM. PERIOD OF TIME THAN WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE EMPOWER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE OR S. R. L. WAS ADOPTED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. TO DEVELOP A RESPONSE TO THE S. R. L. C. D. C. R. REVIEWED SEVERAL SOURCES OF DATA. TO IDENTIFY PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO WARRANT PRIORITIZATION OVER THAT DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THE INCLUSION OF THIS INFORMATION JOINT PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS HAS GREATLY ENHANCED THE VALUE OF THE M. PAR AS A LONGER TERM PLANNING DOCUMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE IMPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN PRIOR YEARS. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE S. R. L. RIGHT IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE NARRATIVE SUPPLEMENT THAT WAS RELEASED WITH THE- PART. OF PORTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WAS DISCUSSED AND THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE SUPPLEMENT. INCLUDED WHETHER ANY OF THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE M. PARK WERE SIGNIFICANT SCALE THAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS CONSOLIDATION OF PRISON SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. HOW THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED MANPOWER SUPPORT A LONG TERM DURABLE PORTFOLIO OF FACILITIES FOR CDC ARE. AND DESCRIBING THE STEPS TAKEN IN PROJECT PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION TO MINIMIZE INVESTMENTS IN PRISONS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE CLOSURES. CHANGE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE S. R. L. I WAS AT THE LEGISLATURE WAS LOOKING FOR A DEEPER DIVE A REGARDING LARGE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED AT OUR INSTITUTIONS IN THE FUTURE- THIS SPECIFIC REQUEST WAS FOR PROJECTS ESTIMATED TO COST. OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE- AND THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO BE NEEDED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. BUT ALL STATES ARE ALSO REQUESTED- CDCR LOOK AT WHETHER THE PROJECTS NEEDED NEXT TEN YEARS DROVE THE NEED FOR ANY PRISON CONSOLIDATIONS. THE INFORMATION THAT WE SUBMITTED- BOTH IN THE M. R. AND THEN THE S. R. L. IDENTIFIES THE ANTICIPATED PROJECT NEEDS THAT ARE ACTIVE INSTITUTIONS. AND FOUND THAT THOSE IDENTIFY NEEDS DID NOT DRIVE A FURTHER NEED TO CONSIDER CONSOLIDATION OF PRISONS SO BASED ON CDC OURS INTERPRETATION OF THE S. R. L. REQUEST. WE BELIEVE C. SARS REPORT IT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE S. R. L. THE M. CAR IN THE US ARE OLD RESPONSE I WAS PROVIDED REGARDING FUTURE PROJECT NEEDS IS INTENDED PRIMARILY TO BE A PLANNING DOCUMENT FOR WHAT PROJECTS. C. C. R. MACY IN THE FUTURE. IT DOES NOT REPRESENT REPRESENT OUR CURRENT BUDGET REQUEST AND THUS MUCH OF THE INFORMATION IN THE OF THE REGARDING THE FUTURE PROJECTS IS CONCEPTUAL IN NATURE. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE M. CAR AND THE S. R. O. RESPONSE IS NOT INTENDED BY CDCR TO PROVIDE JUSTIFICATIONS- TO THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKING FUNDING IN THE TWENTY. TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT. THE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE NEEDS ADDRESSED BY EACH PROJECT THAT WE ARE SEEKING FUNDING FOR- THE ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED FOR THOSE PROJECTS. AND HELP PROJECTS FIT WITH A DURABLE PORTFOLIO FACILITIES. IS PROVIDED IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY. THE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING TWO ITEMS BUT TODAY ARE REQUESTED BY CDC R. AS THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FACING CDC ARE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF KEY PROGRAMS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH CARE MEDICAL CARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. OPTION SYSTEM WITH CDCR RESPONSIBILITIES AND- ADDRESS KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS WATER AIR COOLING AND SECURITY RADIUS. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY PRESENT ON THIS ITEM TODAY AS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE- OTHER PANELS THAT SPOKE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MR BOARD- YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. YES GOOD AFTERNOON PUBLISHED WED AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY I'M PART OF THIS YEAR PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION THAN IT HAS IN PREVIOUS. SECOND FOR STRUCTURE PROJECTS AT CDC ARE AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU- L. A. O. IS THAT YOU MISS CAITLYN. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ONE YOUNG AGAIN WITHOUT LEO- THE REPORT THAT CDC ARE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY- THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEMS. DIAL IS IN RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE- AND- AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE DIRECTED CDCR TO. SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSOLIDATE PRESENTS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES AND TO DESCRIBE HOW THE IDENTIFIED PROJECTS WHICH SUPPORT A LONG TERM DURABLE PORTFOLIO OF FACILITIES TO MEET THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION AND THE STATE'S LONG TERM NEED FOR PRISON CAPACITY. AND WE FIND THAT THE REPORT ISN'T FULLY RESPONSIVE TO THESE TO THESE DIRECTIONS- FOR TWO MAIN REASONS THE FIRST ISTHAT IT DOES NOT- ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGNIFICANT PROJECTED DECLINE IN THE PRISON POPULATION AND- SUBSEQUENTLY THE NEED FOR PRISON CAPACITY TO HOUSE THAT POPULATION- IN OTHER WORDS THE REPORT ASSUMES THAT ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATING TODAY WILL. CONTINUE TO BE OPERATED TEN YEARS FROM NOW- DESPITE THE PROJECTED POPULATION DECLINE AND THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSOLIDATE PRESENTS DECEIVED ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES- SECOND THE WE UNDERSTAND BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT DIDN'T DO A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF. THE INMATE REHABILITATION AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS AS IT IDENTIFIED PROJECTS SO WHILE THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE A FEW PROJECTS IN THE TEN YEAR- LIST OF PROJECTS THAT DO ADDRESSED REHABILITATION AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT SAY- REFLECTS REFLECTIVE OF A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF PROJECTED NEED AND THOSE- IN THOSE AREAS- AND THEN WHILE THE S. R. L. DID NOT DIRECTLY REQUIRE CDCR TO CONSIDER THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN- COVER NINETEEN OR OTHER FUTURE POTENTIALLY- AIRBORNE DISEASES- SIXTY EIGHT WE KNOW THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT CONSIDER- THAT ISSUE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS- AND- LOCAL EXPERTS HAVE TESTIFIED IN COURT THAT THE ARCHITECTURE IN PARTICULAR AT SAN QUENTIN HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC DURING KOBE AND- AND- OTHER PRISONS. WELL THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SCRUTINIZED AS CLOSELY AS SAN QUENTIN COULD HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS- AND SO THE MAIN POINT HERE THE MAIN TAKEAWAY WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT ONE VIEWS A SUPPORT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION- IT DOES SEEM THAT THESE LIMITATIONS I'VE DESCRIBED TO. INDICATE THAT THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT CDCR HAS INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ON THE ONE HAND MAY INCLUDE PROJECTS THAT WON'T ALTER THAT ULTIMATELY BE NEEDED BECAUSE- THOSE PARTICULAR FACILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE CLOSED DUE TO DECLINE IN THE NEED FOR PRISON CAPACITY- ON THE OTHER HAND THE REPORT LIKELY MISSES CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT WILL BE NEEDED- GIVEN THAT IT DIDN'T- GET OUT THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF. CERTAIN ISSUES THAT HAVE KEEN ACCESS WITH FACILITIES. I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS O'NEILL- COLLEAGUE SARAH COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU AND SHERRY I ACTUALLY REMEMBER WELL A CONVERSATION LAST YEAR THANK YOU- I'M SURE YOU'LL GET TO THIS BRIDGE AND CLOSURES WHAT I WANT I WANT TO STEP ON NO NO NO QUESTION. BUT THE NOTES NOTE THAT HERE WE HAVE THIS KIND OF ISSUE CATCH TWENTY TWO WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION SAID. SAYS SOMETHING VERY GOOD YOU KNOW THE CLOSURES ARE POINT TIME DECISION EVEN THOUGH- LET YOU KNOW IN THE LARGER CONTEXT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. GO OUT WITH THAT THERE ARE PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE OR CLOSE CERTAIN FACILITIES SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR. THE BELLAGIO HOW DO WE SQUARE. THIS CIRCLE- IT BECAUSE THIS IS. A CANISTERS TO FEEL LIKE KICKING THE CAN. ARE YOU ASKING FOR HOW DO YOU AVOID APPROVING. SORT OF A PLAN FOR HOW TO AVOID APPROVING EDS PROJECTS YES AND HOW DO WE GET TO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE- YOU KNOW WELL PRESCRIBES SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR- WELL WE HAVE. RECOMMENDED IN THE PAST THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WRITTEN DIRECTED DEPARTMENT TO REQUIRE TO REPORT A LIST OF PRISONS THAT IT VIEWS AS- STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE- AND WE'VE SUGGESTED CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IN. DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT THAT LAST A LITTLE BLOOD SUGAR COULD OF COURSE- DEVELOP ITS OWN CRITERIA- DOT HAS NOT RESULTED IN- THE MINISTRATION. PROVIDING PRISONS OR OR EVEN INDICATING- SORT OF A STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO. WHETHER IT INTENDS TO CLOSE PRISONS VERSES CLOSE PORTIONS OF PRISONS AS IT HAS IT HAS IT DONE BOTH IN RECENT YEARS- ANOTHER OPTION OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD PURSUE COULD BE TO- IDENTIFY PRISONS THAT IT THINKS. ARE STRONG GET CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE AND THEN SIMPLY NOT APPROVED- SIGNIFICANT- YOU KNOW- OR LONG TERM. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AT THOSE PRESENTS- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PRISON AT WHICH I. TEST ON LAST YEAR WHICH WERE SEEN CLINTON- CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN- CALIFORNIA. MEN'S COLONY- CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY- AND CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER AS STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE BASED ON THEIR- PRIMARILY THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THERE WHAT WAS THAT PRIOR TO THIS REPORT- VERY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENT NEEDS ADDS ESTIMATED BY- AN EXTERNAL CONSULTING FIRM KITCHELL- AS WELL AS THEIR OPERATIONAL COSTS PER INMATE- CDCR DOESN'T THINK BASED ON THIS REPORT THAT THE STATE WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO INVEST MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE- ON THE SCALE THAT CONTROL RECOMMENDED. BUT NEVERTHELESS THESE FACILITIES DO SEEM TO HAVE ON BALANCE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE- ISSUES. SO THAT'S ANOTHER APPROACH THE LOGISTIC LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. AM I ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY YOU ARE APPRECIATED SODA DIED LOVE TO WE COULD HEAR FROM MR BOARD AS WELL- YOU KNOW IF YOU ACCEPT GENERALLY THE YOU KNOW THE PREMISE OF THE B. ELLIE OWES ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS HOW HOW SHOULD WE THE LEGISLATURE BE THINKING SMARTLY ABOUT THIS. WE'LL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE YOU MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE PROJECTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS TO TRY TO IMPACT THERE BUT I THINK THAT- THEY WORK THE REPORT IS DISCUSSING A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AT THESE PRISONS BUT I THINK CDC OURS- ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT IS AT C. C. R. DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE THE DRIVER OF ANY FUTURE PRISON CLOSURE DECISIONS- THE CDCR NEEDS TO LOOK AT THE MISSION OF PRISONS. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE SERVING OUR OBLIGATIONS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL MEDICAL HEALTHCARE AND ALL OTHER THOSE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS- THE ABILITY TO STAFF PRISONS IT'S MUCH MORE OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR THAT RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DRIVEN BY A PRIMARILY INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED REPORT REPORT- AND I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S NOT- THAT NOT NECESSARILY UNDER MY PURVIEW BUT I THINK THAT APARTMENT HAS. TESTIFIED AND IN MAY THE POSITIONS IN THE PAST THAT IT HAS- IT IT DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT OF PUTTING OUT A LIST OF PRISONS TO CLOSE- OR THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR CLOSURE- DUE TO WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS THAT WOULD OCCUR AT THOSE PRISONS- REGARDING STAFFING AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. SO I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO GO BACK TO IS LANGUAGE THAT WE INCLUDED IN OUR REPORT THAT DISCUSSES HOW THE PROJECTS THAT ARE PUT FORWARD ESPECIALLY PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MARK ARE CAREFULLY VETTED THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LAYERS OF- L. C. D. C. R. C. C. H. C. S. WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION- IN A CAREFULLY WEIGHS THE NEED FOR THE PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED. FOR IN THE FUNDING REQUESTS AGAINST THE RISK THAT IT COULD BE IMPACTED BY FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'LL. BE DISCUSSED- NEXT ITEMS. US NEEDS PRESENT WHERE WE RISK MEDICAL CARE. YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION REQUIRES A HIGH RISK MEDICAL CARE OF THEIR MEMBERS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEM- AND WE FEEL THAT THESE ARE NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS NOW- EVEN IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE IN THE FUTURE A POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL DECISIONS MADE REGARDING CULTURES. AND I DO I DO APPRECIATE THAT HELP TURN IT BACK TO YOU- MADAM CHAIR AGAIN YOU KNOW LIKE I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO WRESTLE WITH US IN LEGISLATURES YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN WE OR CAN WE AVOID MAKING CAN A CAPITAL EXPENDITURE INFRASTRUCTURE PRESENTS AND FOR FACILITIES THAT. WILL YOU KNOW WILL BE THERE FOR WHICH THAT TO USE ONE YOU KNOW FOR FIVE YEARS- STRETCH IN A TIME WHERE WE DO NOT ENJOY WHEN I LIKE ENJOY THE KIND OF SURPLUSES THAT WE DO TODAY SIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. I WILL GO WITH A FURTHER TO SAY THAT I'M DISAPPOINTED. IN THE CD SARS RESPONSE- THIS IS A- LEGISLATURE'S BEEN ASKING FOR THE INFORMATION. VERY CLEAR THAT WE EXPECTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE- AND HOW DO WE MAKE. MEANINGFUL MAKE A MEANINGFUL EVALUATION AND DISCUSS FOR EXAMPLE THE NEXT ISSUE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT THAT THE- CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY AND HERE WE ARE- A YEAR LATER. WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME QUESTIONS- THIS IS DEJA VU- SO SIMILAR TO THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD THE SAME TIME. HIS LAST YEAR IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE- ON WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A LIST OF PRISONS TO BE CLOSED. WE ARE ASKING TO HAVE A PLAN A STRATEGY- SO THAT WE CAN FILL OUR RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED- MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE SAFE CONDITIONS BUT ALSO TO THE INVESTMENTS OF THE- THE TAX DOLLARS. THAT WE MANAGE- THE POPULATION OF THE PRISON SYSTEM IS CHANGING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE AND MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS- ARE YOU YOU MAKE PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE SIZE FOR EXAMPLE AND OF. CERTAIN GROUPS THE AGE DISTRIBUTION THE KINDS OF HEALTH NEEDS- THERE'S SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT. FRANKLY MANY ALL DEPARTMENTS ACROSS OUR OUR STATE AND GOVERNMENT ARE ASKED TO MAKE PLANS. AND- FROM WHAT I CAN SEE THE YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONLY ONES THAT THE ONLY ONE THAT I'VE SEEN THAT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVIDE THAT VISION ON THE PLAN TO US. MAKES IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US WELL WE'RE IN THIS REACTIVE STRATEGY- TO HAVE THEN HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHICH WE KNOW IMPORTANT DECISIONS ON THINGS LIKE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY- YOU KNOW. THE ISSUE DOES COME UP OF COURSE A BIG ISSUE IS. WHAT WHAT ABOUT THESE FACILITIES ARE ANY BUMPER WHAT REASONS MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT- HOT FOR CONSOLIDATION- WE KNOW THAT THE OUR PRISON POPULATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- WHERE DOES THAT FIT INTO THIS AND WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO DO TO HANDLE THAT BECAUSE IT WILL BE LESS- THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT ARE NOW. IN THE PRISONS- AND OF COURSE WE FIND OUT ABOUT OUR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE CORPORATE NINETEEN- THIS HAS THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR MANY YEARS BY ADVOCATES OF- AND NOW WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW IMPACTFUL THEY ARE SUPER THE PRISON PRISON IMPRISONED MEN AND WOMEN SO. ARE I FOR ONE NOT JUST GOING TO SAY THAT'S FINE LET'S LET'S SEE WHAT YOU DO NEXT YEAR I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE- SO WE'LL- SEE WHAT WE SEE- HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT. IN THIS BUDGET. SO WE MOVE ON NOW TO THE NEXT ISSUE ISSUE THREE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS. C. A. R. IS THAT MR LEAVE YES THANK YOU- CHRIS LEAF- DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT C.

OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. AND I'M SORRY THE SECOND WAS ABOUT. IT WAS ABOUT THEM WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE MEANWHILE TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING OUTSIDE I TOOK OVER THAT YEAH- AND THEN I HAVE OF THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS- WE HAVE BEEN HEARING- ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL ABILITY OF VISITATION SPACES AND- PROGRAMMING SPACIOUS SPACES OF. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE KNOWN I MEAN AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO PROPOSALS FOR THOSE KINDS OF SPACES- AND NOW AS FAR AS A CAPITAL REQUEST GOES SO I'M NOT AWARE- ANY SPECIFICS TO- ADD TO THE CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT. OKAY WELL WE'LL WE'LL GET MORE SPECIFIC BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS AS YOU'RE DOING AS YOU TO KENTUCKY INTO ACCOUNT. THESE THESE PROPOSALS ARE ARE YOU INCLUDING THE NEED FOR SPACE FOR PROGRAMMING ON THE NEED FOR SPACE FOR VISITATION. YES SIR CERTAINLY THEIR THEIR NUMBER OF DRIVERS FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL NEEDS AT AT OUR PRISONS- WE DO HAVE- PROPOSALS FOR REHABILITATIVE SPACE THE- SACRAMENTO- CSP SACRAMENTO- CLASSROOM SPACES AN EXAMPLE- AND- WE CERTAINLY ARE SENSITIVE TO THE- IMPORTANCE OF- VISITATION.

I WILL START OUT ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR AND THEN THE HAND OFF TO MY- COLLEAGUES- SO THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THE TEST TEAMS- CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSAL THAT MYSTERIOUS SPRAYED AND- ALLUDED TO. WHICH IS NE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND FOR FANS PLANNING PURPOSES. FOR FUTURE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- THE SCOND IS A SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND REQUEST. FOR PROOF REPLACEMENTS AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN AND THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY. THAT'S A STARTING AS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION OF SPECIAL CARE FUNDING FOR ROOF REPLACEMENTS AT ELEVEN PERSONS. AND REPLACING GROUPS EXTEND THE USEFUL LIFE OF HER PRISONER CONSTRUCTION- AND HELP MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF PROGRAMS WITHIN PRISONS- THAT LASTS A REQUEST THAT I WILL ADDRESS. IS ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY AND THIRTEEN OFFICE TECHNICIAN POSITIONS- TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR INMATE WORK LABOR PROGRAM WHICH USES INMATE AND TRADE LABOR TO CONSTRUCT BOTH CAPITAL OUTLAY AND SPECIAL REPAIR FUNDED PROJECTS THAT ARE INSTITUTIONS. ROGER CONSTRUCTED BY THE OTHER REAL PROGRAM HAVE INCREASED IN COMPLEXITY AND THESE COMPLEX PROJECTS HAVE MANY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HANDLED BY CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISORS- THE OFFICE TECHNICIANS IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL RELIEVE THE CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISORS OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES. ALLOWING THEM TO FOCUS ON THE SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION IT'S MR CLINTON. THAT AFTERNOON ABOUT VERSACE'S MODEL MCLEAN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OFFICE OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES PURSEEASIER I'M COVERING THE UTILITIES AND WASTE REMOVAL ITEM THIS REQUEST ESTABLISHES A UPDATED FUNDING METHODOLOGY FOR UTILITIES AND WASTE REMOVAL CREDITORS PREVIOUSLY UTILITIES AT REASONABLE COSTS FOR BUDGET AUTECHRE INNATE BASIS WHICH HAS LESS THAN APARTMENT UNDERFUNDED BECAUSE THIS METHODOLOGY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR TRUE COST DRIVERS OF THESE EXPENDITURES. ADJUSTING THE FUNNY METHODOLOGY WILL DISCUSS HIS ASSOCIATE THE FINDING FROM A POPULATION CHANGES AND USES A THREE YEAR AVERAGE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AS THE NEW BABY ADDITIONALLY THIS REQUEST WELL ESTABLISHED A MECHANISM TO ADJUST THE FUNDING UP OR DOWN. BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S TPI. WITH THAT I WILL TRY IT OVER TO GAVE YOU CAN LAST. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M RON DAVIS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ZERO REQUEST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR A CONSULTING CONTRACT TO EVALUATE THE CONDEMNED HOUSING RECREATION AND SPORTS SPACES AT SAN QUENTIN FOR USED POST CONDEMNED. AS CONSULT WILL PROVIDE IDEAS HOW TO USE THIS EXISTING SPACE- ARE HOW THIS EXISTING SPACE CAN BE USED TO CREATE A POSITIVE HEALING ENVIRONMENT THAT PROVIDES INCREASED REHABILITATIVE EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTHCARE OPPORTUNITIES AT SAC QUITE THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS MATTER. OKAY. DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. JUST TO REITERATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT FOR THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE ONE OUTLINED IN THIS ISSUE. OKAY M. L. A. O. I'M WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS ON ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS EXCEPT FOR THE REQUEST FOR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO CONTRACT WITH A CONSULTANT TO RE ENVISION CONDEMNED HOUSING AT SAN QUENTIN I'M NOT IS BECAUSE THE ARCHITECTURE OF CERTAIN HOUSING FACILITIES AT ST CLINTON HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND THAT INCLUDES THE FACILITIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY CONSIST OF FIVE TIERS OF CELLS- STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH OPEN BAR DOORS ALLOWING AIR TO FLOW BETWEEN NEIGHBORING CELLS AS WELL AS- FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE OUTSIDE ERR INTAKE AS MANY OF THE WINDOWS WE UNDERSTAND- WELL THE CHILD AND- THE AIR INSIDE THE FACILITY IS ESSENTIALLY CIRCULATED BY LARGE. INDUSTRIAL FANS- AND SO WELL CDCR HASN'T DEFINED THE SCOPE OF THE CONSULTANTS OF WHAT THE CONSULTANT WOULD DO IF APPROVED- WE UNDERSTAND BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT IT DOES NOT PLAN TO. REQUIRE THE CONSULTANT TO CONSIDER- THE ABOVE ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THAT I. DESCRIBED AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT TO DATE TO THE EXTENT CDC ARE LATER MODIFIED THE FACILITY TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS I SAID JUST BY ADDING SOME KIND OF THAT- SYSTEM FOR. EXCHANGING THE AIR I'M- MORE FREQUENTLY. IT COULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDO OR DESTROY WHATEVER MODIFICATIONS RESULTS FROM THIS CONSULTANTS- RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED DEPARTMENT TO REPORT AT BUDGET HEARINGS ON- THAT **** DAY- DEFINE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED CONSULTANTS WORK. THE RATIONALE FOR NOT HAVING THE CONSULTANT CONSIDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IDENTIFIED- AS WELL AS THE COST OF REQUIRING THE CONSULTANT TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. I THINK MY- COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY HAVE. BEEN INTENDING TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS OR OTHER ITEMS- IN THIS. IN THIS ISSUE THAT ACCIDENTALLY GOT SKIPPED. THANK YOU. HI LANEY SCHNEIDER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STATES CAITLYN- I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO AS FAR AS ADDRESSING THE SCOPE AND PROTEST POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FINAL AMOUNT COULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER OR LOWER. DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE THAT'S FINALIZED EYES THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGES BUT THE CONTRACTOR- AND THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T ARE TO BE PLANNED TO PRECLUDE THE CONSULTANT FROM CONSIDERING DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WHEN MAKING A RECOMMENDATION. WE REITERATE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ASSESSMENT AND ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATION IS TO GENERATE IDEAS ON THE BEST USE OF THE SPACE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. SO WE HAVE LEFT IT VERY. RIGHT UP. RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WITH REGARDS TO THE- STATEWIDE BUDGET PACKAGE. HELLO I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SEE YOUR HAND OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON INSTANT PAYMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK- BRIEFLY THE UTILITIES AND WASTE REMOVL FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND JUST KNOW THAT THAT- THESE METHODOLOGIES HAVEN'T BEEN ADJUSTED- SINCE TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR THE WASTE REMOVAL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FOR THE UTILITIES. AND WHILE SINCE THAT TIME COST OF GROWING EVEN WITH THE REDUCED POPULATIONS SUCH AS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE POPULATIONS CLOSE TO NINETY SIX THOUSAND AND UTILITIES COSTS. FAR EXCEEDED- BUDGETED AMOUNTS SO WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THAT- WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE CONSISTENT AND REASONABLE- BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. THANK YOU I'M SORRY THE- I GOT- I MISSED YOU THERE- OKAY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THE- PLANNING A PROPOSAL THE FUNDING FOR THE ADVANCE PLANNING PROPOSAL. COULD THAT- BE USED TO DEVELOP THE STRATEGY- THAT WE HAVE BEEN. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- WHO'S THAT MR LEAF OR ANYONE YEAH THE- IT THAT THIS THIS FUNDING IS TO DEVELOP A BUDGET PACKAGE IS FOR SPECIFIC CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS THAT MAY BE- APPROVED TO- YOU'VE REQUESTED AND FUTURE BUDGETS. WELL ONE THING YOU COULD COVER IS THE LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY SO. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS HERE- TWO MORE QUESTIONS- WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER FACILITIES OR AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY CLOSED OR DECOMMISSION. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT- INSTITUTION SET OF CLOTHES SUCH AS THE DUPLICATION- INSTITUTION. AT ZERO WHOLE FACILITY IN THE AREA YES. WELL THE ONE THE WHOLE FACILITY IT IS CLOSE- IT GOES INTO A WARM SHUT DOWN- STATUS- WHICH INCLUDES A SKELETON CREW TO- PERFORM MINIMAL MAINTENANCE- ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDE SECURITY AT THE FACILITIES- TO- YOU KNOW PREVENTS THE- DEGRADATION OF THE FACILITY. TO AN EXTREME DEGREE AND TO- PREVENTS IT FROM BECOMING AN ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE AN ACTIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE- THAT ARE CLOSE TO- DOES CONTINUE TO BE A MAN'S HANDS- BY BY THE INSTITUTION. OKAY AND THEN- ONE LAST QUESTION IS- I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE ON THE INMATE WARD LABOR CONSTRUCTION- THE PRIDE PROGRAM- HOW SUCCESSFUL DO YOU SEE THAT WORKING AS FAR AS MATCHING THOSE OF MEN AND WOMEN TO- TO- WITH RESTORATION EMPLOYMENT TAXES ACTUAL JOBS YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED- WELL CERTAINLY- THAT THERE IS A REHABILITATIVE COMPONENT FOR THE- INMATE WORKERS AND- THEY ARE LEARNING SKILLS THAT- THEY CAN- BRING TO THEIR POST INCARCERATION LINE. I DON'T HAVE ANY STATS OR EXAMPLES BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A PART OF THE PROGRAM. IF YOU COULD. DIG IN AND- YOU KNOW PROVIDE THAT FOR US I WOULD I WOULD REALLY BE INTERESTED I THINK THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART. OF WHAT WE DO IS TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF CONNECTION AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR- CONNECTED WITH THE US STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL SO- IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AS TO YOUR SUCCESS.
