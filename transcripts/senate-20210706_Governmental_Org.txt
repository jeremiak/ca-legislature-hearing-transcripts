MR SHEPHERDS WE HAVE NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR AT THIS POINT IN TIME WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS. ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO ADDRESS US- CENTER BLOOD TESTS. WHICH IS A POSITION- BOARD DECIDES. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- ASSEMBLYMAN COOPER NICE TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY WE OFTEN TIMES TRY TO PASS BILLS THAT- YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE NEW NEW MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND OTHER. WAYS TO EXPAND. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SO THIS SEEMS TO LIMIT THAT AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO- WHAT'S YOUR REASONING IS BEHIND THAT IS THERE SOME. GENESIS TO THIS BILL THAT YOU DIDN'T OUTLINE IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT FURNITURE CONCERNS WHAT IS YOUR TEMPORARY CONTRACTS AND USING SOME FOLKS GO OVER A YEAR. SO OTHERS OF SHORTAGE- IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T QUITE TAKE A YEAR TO GET SOMEBODY ON BOARD WITH THAT SOURCING IT USED TO BYPASS. THE OF TWO POSITIONS ARE DENNIS WORKING SIDE BY SIDE. IT IS PERSONAL THE TEMPORARIES PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT IS MAKING SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THE STATE EMPLOYEES. THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE SO THERE'S BEEN SOME ABUSE THERE WITH THAT SAID ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE ARE PAYING THEM THESE- OTHER FOLKS MORE. THAN WE'RE PAYING THE STATE WORKERS CORRECT- THAT SEEMS ODD THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY MORE FOR PRIVATE. CONTRACTORS THAN IT WOULD FOR STATE EMPLOYEES A- YOU'RE SURE DOES LOVE THING SOMETIMES YES. OKAY AND I WISH MY- WITNESSES WERE HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN GO INTO MUCH MORE DEPTH THAN I CAN ON THE ISSUE MODERATOR LET'S CHECK AND SEE IF THOSE WITNESSES ARE ON THE LINE IS THERE ANYWAY THIS IS- THAT ARE ON THE LINE. WE DIDN'T BEAT WERE ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF THE QUESTION. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. ELIZABETH YOUR WITNESS YOUR LINE IS OPEN AT THIS TIME. AND I DO NOT SEE ANY OKAY SO I JUST WANNA DO THERE'S GOING TO BE THE LAST WORD I GUESS. OKAY WELL I DO AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOUR WITNESSES WERE ABLE TOBE ON MAYBE THEY'LL POP ON HERE SHORTLY BECAUSE I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT FIDUCIARY CONCERNS IN AN OFTEN TIMES IT HAPPENS IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE. FOR THE STATE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN ADDITION TO IT JUST BEING MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PERSONNEL. BUT I HEARD TWO THINGS ONE IT WAS A FIDUCIARY REASON AND THEN I HEARD. THAT THE STATUS. PAYING MORE THAN WE NEED TO SELL WHICH IS IT. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT IN A GOOD SHIFT CONTRACTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CIVIL SERVICE RULES. WE GO OUTSIDE. I'M SORRY SAY AGAIN I HEAR THE FIRST PART. OF THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO CIVIL SERVICE RULES. BUT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD STILL HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES AND THE UNIONS CAN STILL CONTEST THOSE THOSE CONTRACTS RIGHT. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THEY CAN BUT WITH THESE CONTRACTS- OBVIOUSLY THEIR PAY MORE SO THAT THAT THAT IS FACTUAL. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS. I THINK MY COLLEAGUE- POSE QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO POSE IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS A MEMBER- I KNOW HE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATOR- AS I MENTIONED- MY COLLEAGUE POSE THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED TO POSE BUT- MAYBE I'LL JUST FOLLOW THIS LAST RABBIT DOWN THE HOLE. THE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH THE UNIONS THAT REPRESENT THE EMPLOYEE BLOCKS- CAN YOU EXPLAIN. WHY THAT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SHORT TERM. CONTRACTS. WHY WOULD IT BE ESSENTIAL THAT THAT INFORMATION BE CONVEYED TO THE UNION. THAT REPRESENTS THAT EMPLOYEE WALK BECAUSE ONE OF THESE FOLKS ARE BEING PAID THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY'VE CIRCUMVENTED. THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S REASONABLE TO BEING PAID HIGHER BECAUSE- WITH THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM THERE IS NEGOTIATED BUT IT'S OPENS THEY'RE PAYING MORE I REALIZE A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS BUT- TO DO THE SAME JOB AND GET PAID SUBSTANTIALLY MORE- IT DOESN'T. FIT WELL TO OUR DOCKS IN OUR POSITIONS THAT- DO IT FROM. SAY RIGHT NOW THAT'S REALLY THE BIG ISSUE. WHAT AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SHORT TERM EMPLOYEES ARE PAID MORE THAN STATE EMPLOYEES. BY THE VERY NATURE OF A SHORT TERM CONTRACT YOU'RE SATISFYING IN. AN IMMEDIATE NEED. HI OF COURSE THE PREMIUMS GO UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I GUESS MY CONCERN AND I KNOW YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK- WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC. IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE NIMBLE HEALTH SYSTEM. FIVE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. EXTERNALITIES IN THINGS THAT CANNOT BE FORESEEN- COME ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PANDEMIC IS GOING TO GO NEXT. BUT IF WE CURTAIL. THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO CONTRACT OUT FOR THESE SERVICES. I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CUTTING OUR NOSE TO SPITE OUR FACE IN NOT LEARNING LESSONS. SHOULD BE LEARNED FROM OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF SO- I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU DO- THERE MIGHT JUST. BE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE ON THIS ONE MY FRIENDS. SURE IT WOULD BE FILLED WITH C. C. R. THAT HAVE BEEN PSYCHIATRIST THAT MADE- THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON A CONTRACT SERVICE LIKE THIS. IS A- FULL TIME- SEE IF YOUR EMPLOYEES THAT MAKES IT'S ACTUALLY LESS. SO THIS THIS IS UNFAIR VIEWS BUT IT'S WIDESPREAD. THIS IS THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO CONTRACT OUT. FOR SHORT TERM NOT LONG TERM BUT FOR SHORT TERM CONTRACTS YOU WERE FILLING SPECIFIC GAPS. IN THAT NATION QUALIFICATION. NATURALLY WAS PROBABLY GOING TO DEMAND A HIGHER PAY THAN A FULL TIME LONG TERM CONTRACT FROM AN EMPLOYEE BLOCK. INTERNATIONALLY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE SPECIFIED HERE. THEY CAN'T CONTRACT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR SO I THINK A YEAR IS SUBSTANTIAL TIME TO TRY TO FIND SOMEONE FOR A YEAR OR THIRTY FIVE DAYS IN A IN A TWO MONTH TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD. WE'RE TRYING TO NEARLY DIVINE THAT. IT ALSO SHOULD BE POINTED OUT- DENTURES THAT CENTER MELINDA'S WILL PROCEED THIS IS A- GIVEN HER EMOTIONS ON. A REGULAR BASIS IN OUR SESSIONS. BUT SPECIFIES THAT NOTHING SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND STATUTES.DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. SO THERE IS- ESCAPE HATCH THERE IF WE- DO HAVE EMERGENCIES. CENTER LASER. THANK YOU AT CHER DIED ASSEMBLYMAN I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT BILL TO US IT STIMULATES AN IMPORTANT DEBATE- AND FOR ME I'M STRUGGLING ON ON THE BILL BECAUSE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT- HOPING THAT YOU COULD- BE CLEARER ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM I MEAN WE ALWAYS HAVE ANECDOTES THROUGHOUT OUR- WHERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME PROBLEMS BUT- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE- EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AS YOU SEE IT. WHAT WHAT DATA DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW- THAT THAT THAT- THAT WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES BECAUSE THE RULES ARE CLEAR HERE. THAT A PROPOSED CONTRACT SHOULD RESULT IN AN OVERALL COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE SHORT TERM CONTRACTS TURNING INTO LONG TERM CONTRACTS THAT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE AND- MY WITNESSES WHO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE HERE- CAN ACTUALLY TESTIFY THAT BUT IT'S- IT'S BEEN GOING ON A REGULAR BASIS IS EXACERBATED. EXACERBATED BY THE SWORD OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS THAT PROVIDES ANY SPECIFIC DATA- I COULD GO TO THAT COMMITTEE CANCELED AND ASK IF HE IS AWARE OF ANY DATA. PROVIDED TO HIM. IT SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM. CAN I ASK MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN I ASK THEIR CONSOLE THERE'S BEEN ANY DATA HE'S AWARE OF. THAT SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM. YES AS AS A WE ASKED A DISEASE RATHER INFORMATION. CENTER UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THEM- AND THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. BUT YOU KNOW WE GET HIT ALL THE TIME ABOUT A LACK OF EFFICIENCY IN STATE GOVERNMENT. SO WE SET RULES THAT SAY CONTRACTING OUT GONNA HAPPEN IN LIMITED WAYS. BUT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERALL COST SAVINGS. I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS HERE ON IN THE ANALYSIS- AND LISTEN I HEAR THAT I HEAR THE APPEAL ABOUT A YEAR BUT NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GET A REGULATION OF THE STATED A YEAR. ON LABOR VIOLATIONS- DURING A PANDEMIC. SO WE HAVE STRUGGLE AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF WE'LL BUY YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS SO IS SO BROAD BASED IN ITS APPLICATION THAT I CAN HAVE A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS WHY I GO BACK TO. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IS THE ABUSE HAPPENING- AND IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THAT THAT MAY BE THE RIGHT. IN A TWO STEP THE FIRST STEP IS REALLY TO FIND OUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND A BILL THAT. SAYS THAT WE NEED THE STATE TO REPORT IN ON ALL THE EXAMPLES OF CONTRACTING OUT BEYOND THE YEAR. SO WE COULD SEE THAT DATA AND THAT ABUSE MIGHT BE THE- THE FIRST STEP OF A TWO STEP HERE. TO ADVANCE THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS THE BEST OF INTENTIONS- BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S ON A FOUNDATION THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE. CLEAR. TO ME AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. YOUR COMMENTS IN- CHAIR I'VE BEEN TOLD. DOCTOR CAME IN THE LINE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO TO HIM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOCTOR WAS A DOCTOR KING I'M SORRY DR KIM. DR KID CAN YOU PLEASE PROCEED. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF. SO MAYBE CHARTER BUSES CAN YOU HEAR ME. JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT HELLO OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME- CHAIRMAN YES WE CAN'T PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR STUART BUCKY AND PRESIDENT OF THE UAE PD THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS DENTISTS. BUT I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF EIGHTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN. THIS BILL AND SIGNED INTO LAW WILL IMPROVE THE HIRING PROCESS OF THE DOCTORS DENTISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND WILL REDUCE THE CIVIL SERVANTS VACANCY RATE. AND SAVE MILLIONS FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. HI I DID HEAR OF ONE OF THE- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SAY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE. IS THERE A USES THERE'S DEFINITELY ABUSE. FOR DECADES THE STATUS CONTRACTED OUT OUR BARGAINING UNIT BACON CHEESE TOO EXPENSIVE PRIVATE REGISTRIES. AND THE NUMBERS ARE ENORMOUS- I'LL TELL YOU IN A SECOND OUR CIVIL SERVICE WORKFORCE IS LYNDALL DOWN TO IT- SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. MINIMAL SALARY INCREASES VERY ANEMIC RECRUITING EFFORTS BY THE STATE. THE STATE WILL CLAIM THAT THEY PREFER CIVIL SERVICE DOCTORS OVER CONTRACT IT'S BEHAVIOR INDICATE OTHERWISE WHETHER IT'S NEGOTIATING OUR AMMO USER MEETING WITH THE U. H. P. D. N. CONTRACTING OUT COMMITTEE LITTLE CURVATURES PAY TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. NO WONDER THE CDCR PSYCHIATRY VACANCY. RATE IS NEARLY 50% WE'VE TRIED PRETTY APPOINTMENTS AT AT A BASE RATE. NO NO EXTRA BONUSES THE STATE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO US. THE VACANCY RATE THAT SOME D. S. H. STATE OCTOBER IS THAT 80% SO ON THE OTHER HAND AT THIS YOU SEE THEM GIVING THE CONTRACTORS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. PLUS A SIXTY FIVE DOLLAR ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WHICH IS QUITE THE SALARY OF OUR PSYCHIATRIST. CONTRACTORS MAKE UP TO SEVENTY TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE GUY MADE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE MONTH. ACCORDING TO THE DATA SUPPLIED BY THE STATE SO WE HAVE THE DATA TO BACK UP. THAT BETWEEN THE CDC ARE CONTRACTED TO DSHS COSTING ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY. FOR THESE PEOPLE ALL THESE CONTRACTS TO KEEP RE UPPING THE PLANNERS EMERGE. TAKE OUR JOBS AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR PATIENTS BETTER THAN THE CONTRACTORS KNOW THEIR INSTITUTIONS. AND THERE'S AN ADDICTION GOING ON- I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW SIR MY- HYPOTHESIZE WHY IT SHOULD EXIST WITH PRIVATE REGISTRIES. OF CHARGE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHO DON'T PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICE WE DON'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE. AS GOOD SERVICES AS PEOPLE WHO KNOW. THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES- ACTUALLY IN CONFLICT WITH THE GOALS OF THE PRODUCT AND COLEMAN LAWSUITS WHICH IS. KNOWN BY. YOU KNOW GOOD PEOPLE SERVICE WITH CONSISTENT. CONTINUITY OF CARE AND SO SIMPLE SERVICE PROVIDER COMPANY CARE CONTRACTORS LESS SO. WELL ACTUALLY FOR TWENTY TWO ON THE ONE IT'S UP TO INCENTIVIZE DOCTORS BY CREATING A REGISTRY.

NO EXTRA PREMIUM FOR STAYING LATE WORKING AN EXTRA TWENTY HOURS PROVIDING EXTRA SERVICES AT NO COST TO THE STATE THE STATE HAS NOT COOPERATED THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENCE WILL NOT GRANT THIS FORCE SO WE'RE PULLING OUR HAIR OUT. GIVING BETTER SERVICE AT A LOWER RATE AND THE STATE STILL GOES ON AND TIRED THESE PEOPLE AT TWICE THE RATE MAKES NO BUSINESS SENSE AND ONE ONE FOOTNOTE ONE FINAL FOLLOW UP QUESTION IF I MAY WHICH IS THAT- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THAT YET THE STATES REQUIRED TO- SPECIFY THE COST SAVINGS AND I GUESS I WOULD NOTE THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COMPARING A CONTRACTOR WITH AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ALL THE PAY AND BENEFITS THAT THAT STATE EMPLOYEES MAKING SO ONCE AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING IN THE RECORD. HERE THAT. PROVIDES A- CLEARED DATA THE PNG AND FOR THE KIDS THAT WE HAVE READ.

THE WITNESSES MADE AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- HE'S ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHICH I'VE STRONGLY SUPPORT. WHERE THE EMPLOYEE GROUP AND THE ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN THESE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS AND- THAT'S A PROCESS I THINK WE SHOULD RESPECT. I MEAN TIME AND TIME AGAIN MEASURES F CALM BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE THAT CIRCUMVENT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THAT EVERYONE CLAIMS RITUALS TO HONOR AND RESPECT. AND THIS SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IF WE HAVE CLEAR REVIEWS THAT IT'S UP TO US AS POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE CHANGES BUT I SAY AGAIN WE'RE ON THE RECORD.

IT DOES THAT THROUGH A PROVISION THAT SAYS. ONLY TWO OF THE THREE PARTIES NEED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT IN ORDER FOR THOSE WAGERING ACTIVITY TO TAKE PLACE. AND THE BALANCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE THIRD PARTY WHICH IS NOT A PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT. HAS A RIGHT TO INITIATE AN ARBITRATION PROCESS- IF IT BELIEVES THE AGREEMENT NOT FAIR- THIS ARBITRATION PROCESS THIS BALANCING ACT WE AS AN INDUSTRY HAVE LIVED UNDER FOR THE LAST ROUGHLY SIXTEEN YEARS AND ITS SERVICE WELL- THE ACTIVITIES GROWN IT'S PROVIDED- ECONOMIC- USE YOUR BENEFITS ALL PARTIES AND IT'S JUST BEEN A- A FAIR PROCESS ONLY THIS PAST DECEMBER.

A CELERY TO PROGRAM WHICH WILL PROVIDE A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT. TO HELP SMALL JURISDICTIONS TO SMALLER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. UNLIKE LARGER JURISDICTIONS LARGE CITIES ARE SOME TRANSIT DISTRICTS AND THE LIKE SMALLER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FREQUENTLY. LACK THE STAFFING RESOURCES. TO IDENTIFY AND PURSUE STATE GRANTS. GET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PURSUE FINANCING TOOLS NECESSARY TO PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AFFORDABLY. CAN SO FOR EXAMPLE A- LARGE CITY LIKE LA MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A BULK DISCOUNT WHEN BUYING FIVE HUNDRED ELECTRIC BUSES AT A TIME. BUT THAT'S UNAVAILABLE IN A CITY LIKE WATSONVILLE. PURCHASES TO. SO ASSEMBLY BILL. ONE ONE ONE ZERO WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY PROVIDING LOW COST FINANCING OPTIONS. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS- ENSURING THAT WE CONSOLIDATE PURCHASES TO.

STRUCTURES FINALLY CREATE CHAPTER TWO NEED TO MOBILIZE SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE CAPITAL- NOT JUST STATE MONEY AND STATE INCENTIVES THAT ARE HELPING FOLKS TO TRANSITION HERE.

OF ACCEPTING THE TWENTY MINUTES FOR THE GERMAN BORDER FORCE IN THE BILL AND MAKE IT ALMOST IDENTICAL TO MY EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY TWO FROM TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE GRATEFULLY- PAST. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED ON THE ADDITIONAL BOREAL FOREST AND AS THE ONLY CURRENT KTM ONE LEGISLATURE ELECTED LEGISLATOR ADAM AND MINIMIZES CONCERNS AND APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SCOPE OF TROPICAL FORESTS. I DO HOPE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND BUILD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE POLICY IN THE FUTURE AS WELL TROPICAL AND BOREAL FORESTS ARE AMONG THE MOST CARBON DENSE FORESTS ON EARTH. AND THEY PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN STORING CARBON AND PROVIDING HABITAT FOR COUNTLESS ANIMAL AND PLANT SPECIES. THE DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF THESE FOUR IS GOOD AND DISTINGUISH REAL SCALE EXPLOITATION RESPONSIBLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AS WELL AS WIDE RANGING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO PROTECT INDIGENOUS LIVES TO WORSHIP AND GOVERNANCE OF THESE LANDS. THAT IS AMENDED EIGHTY FOUR SIXTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION PREDETERMINED ACT WOULD REQUIRE ANY ENTITIES CONTRACT WITH THE CITY CALIFORNIA TO CERTIFY THAT THEY'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. THIRTY FOUR SIXTEEN IS MODELED AFTER EXISTING SELECT FREE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STATE CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENT BEEN AGAINST CHILD LABOR SO THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO PROCUREMENT POLICIES THE STATE IS IMPLEMENTED IN PAST YEARS. TO HELP ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS WE ARE WORKING WITH OR NOT ENGAGING. IN HARMFUL PRACTICES. ALSO IN ORDER PROMOTE PRACTICE. THE PEOPLE SIXTEEN REQUIRE ON THE PART GENERALS. TO DEVELOP A DEFORESTED FREE CALL OF CONDUCT. TO AVOID GUY TO COME. IN ORDER TO. FOR US FOR COME ON. IN THEIR SUPPLIES. AT THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA'S PURCHASING POWER HAS SIGNIFICANT MARKET FORCE OF THIS STILL EXTENDS OUR STATE'S. ENVIRONMENT LEADERSHIP TO THE PROTECTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS. BY ADOPTING THIS PROCUREMENT POLICY RICHER THE STATE IS NOT IN IN IN BURTON. CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF TROPICAL FOREST.

N. ACEST PROGRESS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND FOUND THAT NOT ONLY IN THE WORLD MISSED ITS OWN TWENTY TWENTY TARGET BUT INSTEAD GLOBAL DEFORESTATION HAD INCREASED BY OVER FORTY PERCENT. WHY DEFORESTATION INCREASING BECAUSE THERE IS NO ECONOMIC OR REGULATORY INCENTIVE TO STOP IT EIGHTY FOUR ONE SIX CAN CHANGE THAT. A RECENT DRAFT STUDY BY FRIENDS OF THE EARTH REVEALED THAT ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC PURCHASING IS LINKED TO THE RISK OF. TROPICAL DEFORESTATION.

THIS LEGISLATION IS ISRAELI THE- AN IRRITANT ALLIES IN THE NEAR TERM. INTERFERING IN THE MARKETS THIS WAY WITH SWEEPING DEFINITIONS OF RISK. I USUALLY DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT THESE THINGS WITH THE PASSION THAT I THAT I DO BUT THIS ONE IS JUST GOING TOO FAR. IF ANYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW. TO MANAGE OUR FORESTS AND WILDLANDS AND HERE WE ARE GOING TO. BE MICRO MANAGED IN THE MARKETS AND THE BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE IN THE AMOUNT OF FILINGS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PLACED ON THE BURDENS ON THESE BUSINESSES. AND MOST PARTICULARLY LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE LITIGATION THAT WILL A POLE AND INTO. FROM THE PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION. OUR ORIGINAL. SEVERAL BOARD JUST. THANK YOU CHAIR- I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT- CANADA-% BROUGHT TO BEAR SOME IMPORTANT POINTS- THAT ALLOW FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE EXCLUDE THEM- MAYBE I CAN POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHORS TO THE CHAIR. BY ALL MEANS. SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT- FORCE AT RISK- THE PERSON COMES MY WOULD BE LIKE BRAZIL. IS THAT WHERE THIS IS. LARGELY ORIENTED DETAILS OF THE PROTECTION OF THE CHURCH IN SEVENTY ONE OF SEVERAL COUNTRIES AT THAT TIME TROPICAL FORESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY- HAVING SOME LARGE AMOUNTS OF ISSUES REGARDING SUSTAINABILITY AND DEFORESTATION NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE- THERE A QUITE A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES ALONG THE TALK ABOUT. ALL RIGHT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION- AS A FOLLOW UP WOULD BE. WHEN WE START DELVING INTO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND- PROMOTING CALIFORNIA IS HAVING A DIFFERENT SET OF STANDARDS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I WOULD HAVE AND MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER IF IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED AT ALL OR MAYBE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE. ALTOGETHER IS WHETHER OR NOT ANY TRADE AGREEMENT. THAT MIGHT EXIST BETWEEN THE US AND BRAZIL. WOULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH. PIECE OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THIS HERBAL BUSINESS LEGISLATION IS NOT TARGET ANY INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY WHAT IT DOES IS SETS VALUES FOR US AS A STATE AS TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO DEFORESTATION FOR PROCUREMENT POLICIES IT'S ONLY REGARDING STATE PURCHASING INSIDE TELLING PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF PRECEDENT FOR INCLUDING LAST COUPLE YEARS- BANNING COSMETICS THAT- INVOLVE ANIMAL TESTING- THERE WAS AT THE IME- THERE IS SOME CONCERN FROM CHINA AT THE TIME OF THE CONSOLE OTHER COUNTRIES BUT NOT ONLY WAS IT A DOCTOR BUT WE SEE THE INDUSTRY MOVE IN A MUCH MORE POSITIVE DIRECTION AGAIN IT'S NOT IT'S USING OUR PURCHASING POWER TO REPRESENT OUR VALUES AND IN NO WAY. PROHIBITS ANY INTERACTION OR TRADE WITH ANY NATION AS LONG AS THEY'RE OPERATING IN A SUSTAINABLE. MANNER AND THERE ARE METRICS WITHOUT. ALL RIGHT SIR THEY'RE IN A YOUR ESTIMATION THERE NO CALL. WITH THIS. PROCUREMENT POLICY IN ANY. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN THE U. S. OR ANY OF THE- RAIN FOREST- AND PROTECTED. WOULD PRODUCING AREAS OF THE WORLD. NO I FIND IT IN PARALLEL TO OURS FOR FREE COULD CONDUCT WHICH BANS. PROCUREMENT OF FURNITURE OUT LABOR. OKAY I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT THE HOLE IN THE PAPER PRODUCTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT- THIS MAY SEEM MORE SYMBOLIC BUT I THINK THERE IS ACTUAL- FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE. TO THIS- AND- I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD BE. I HAVE CONCERNS THAT WE MAY BE EMBARKING- ONCE AGAIN INTO DISTURBING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND OUR INFLUENCE IN ALL AREAS OF- FOREIGN POLICY- I THINK IF THERE WAS- IF THERE WAS MORE. MORE INVESTMENT IN RESEARCHING THIS I WOULD FEEL MORE BETTER ABOUT IT BUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW I THINK REPRESENTING THAT THIS IS THE ONLY STATE PROCUREMENT AND NOT PRIVATE PROCUREMENT. THAT'S A DIFFERENCE WITHOUT A DISTINCTION- CELL THANK YOU. A MEMBERS WISHING TO- DISCUSS THIS ITEM. WE HAVE A MOTION. CENTRE ALAN MOVES- A BEAT FOR SIXTEEN- SEND A SEVEN MEMBER CALLER WHICH LIKE CLOSER THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I'LL JUST SAY OH CANADA.
