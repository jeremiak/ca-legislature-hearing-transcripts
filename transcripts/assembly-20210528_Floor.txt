ASSEMBLY GREW ELEVEN TWENTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE OF STATE GOVERNMENT. WHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM IS TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TO OUR NATION. HATE CRIME TOTALS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN HIT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER A DECADE SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN HATE CRIME INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED. IN TWENTY TWENTY AS WE ALL KNOW ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES SURGED BY ONE HUNDRED AND 49% AND HATE CRIMES AGAINST GAY MEN JUMPED NEARLY 30% TO SEVENTY CRIMES AND ANTI TRANSGENDER HATE CRIMES ROSE ABOUT 26% WELL WE HAVE SOME DATA ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF HATE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING PERPETRATED EXPERTS SAY THAT THE FBI DATA LIKELY UNDERCOUNTS THE NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES OCCURRING IN AMERICA. BOTH BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS DO NOT REPORT INCIDENTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT HATE CRIME DATA TO THE FBI. THE FBI RELIES ON VOLUNTEER REPORTING OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPATING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND LAST YEAR 86% OF THEM DID NOT REPORT A SINGLE HATE CRIME AND WE KNOW. THAT THAT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT UNDERCOUNTS UNDERCOUNT. SO DUE TO THE STAGGERING STATISTICS IN CHALLENGES OF MONITORING COLLECTING AND ANALYZING THIS DATA IT'S CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS BETTER TOOLS AND DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS TO HELP US TRACK AND REPORT THIS INFORMATION. AND TURN IT INTO RECOMMENDATIONS. THE COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE WILL MONITOR AND ASSESS CURRENT TRENDS RELATIVE DAY CRIMES PRODUCE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THESE TRENDS AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES. AND DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO HELP THE STATE BE AWARE OF ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY REDUCE INSTANCES OF THESE CRIMES. THIS BILL IS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

TODAY THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS DEPART FROM THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MODEL OF MARRIED COUPLE WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN AND SAID THOSE FAMILIES INCLUDE LOVE ONCE YOU AREN'T BIOLOGICALLY OR LEGALLY RELATED DATA FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY SENSES YOUR SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN POINT 4% OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS FOLLOW THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY STRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA FAMILY LEAVE LAWS CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE OUTDATED TRADITIONAL FAMILY MODEL ONLY ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR NARROWLY DEFINED FAMILY MEMBERS THIS POLICY GAP DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THE L. G. B. T. Q. I COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA HAS THE FOURTH LARGEST LGBTQ I POPULATION THE U. S. AND MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY DO NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES. THEREFORE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL SUPPORT AND RELY ON THEIR CHOSEN FAMILY INSTEAD. WE ARE BEHIND AND MODERNIZING OUR LANGUAGE AS A STATE ORGAN CONNECTICUT NEW JERSEY COLORADO EIGHT OTHER LOCALITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES. HAVE SIMILAR LAWS ON THE BOOKS IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THESE OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT. TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES REGARDLESS OF THEIR BLOOD OR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP. A. B. TEN FORTY ONE IS SPONSORED BY EQUALITY CALIFORNIA EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES CALIFORNIA LAWYERS EMPLOYMENT ASSOCIATION AND LEGAL IT WORK.

THANK YOU MISS WICKS MISS PARA QUE HAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN FORTY ONE AND AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION SPOKE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FILLED WITH DIVERSE MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND THIS BODY HAS MADE EFFORTS TO ENSURE. THAT GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES WHO CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M SURE MANY OF US KNOW ON THIS FLOOR. IS IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE BIOLOGICAL FAMILY THAT IS THERE TO CARE FOR CHILDREN WHEN THERE AND WHEN THEY'RE ILL OR IN NEED. PERSONALLY MY PARENTS LEFT THEIR HOME STATE AND MOVED TO CALIFORNIA TO BE A PART OF WHAT SILICON VALLEY WAS GOING TO BECOME. THEY HAD NO FAMILY AROUND. SO WITH MY DIANNE AS I CALLED HER WASN'T ACTUALLY MY GRANDMOTHER WHO IS ALWAYS THE GRANDMOTHER IN MY LIFE. AND WHEN MY MOM WAS AVAILABLE IT WAS MY DIANNE WHO TOOK CARE OF ME. SHE I WOULD HAVE BEEN HER DESIGNATED PERSON IN EACH OF US KNOWS FAMILY LIKE THAT BE LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS OR INDIVIDUALS FAR FROM. THE HOMES WHERE THEY WERE RAISED AND THEY DESERVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE. BUT SHE DIDN'T TAKE LIGHTLY THE IMPACTED THIS WOULD HAVE ON CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES AND SHE WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ENSURING THAT IT IS NARROW. AND THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGNATE THE PERSON SO IT IS EASY FOR BUSINESSES TO FOLLOW AND THEY CAN COMPLY WITHOUT FEAR OF UNNECESSARY LITIGATION.

THERE ARE THEMSELVES ON AND THEIR EXPRESSIONS AND THEIR FAMILY NETWORKS. AND I LOVE THAT WE ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL AS WELL ABOUT THINKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER BENEFITS. THINGS LIKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SICK TIME AND OTHER- SO THAT WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN CARE FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND I LOVE. THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY CONNECTS THE TWO BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MODERNIZE. THE STATUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE REFLECTING PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY BUT OTHERS THAT DON'T HAVE TRADITIONAL BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES. BUT RATHER CHOSEN FAMILY THAT I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THEIR LIVES THE FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES HAVE BEEN EQUAL. IN THAT RELATIONSHIP STRUCTURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE A FOUR TO THAN IN THEIR TIME OF NEED I THINK THAT'S REALLY CONNECTS CALIFORNIA VALUES I WANT TO THANK AND COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THIS ON T'S IMPORTANT.

WE CAN'T DO WE CAN DO THIS- WE HAVE TO DO THIS FROM THE LENS OF A COMPREHENSIVE LANCE. HOW CAN WE EXPECT. OFFICERS TO A POLL PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRUST. IF HE OR SHE IS. IN THE COMMUNITY. HAVE BEEN PRESSURED. TO BE PART OF A POLICE OFFICER CLICK OR GANG. IF THEY REFUSE TO JOIN THEY ARE OSTRACIZED. THEY'RE OSTRACIZED LACKS SUPPORT INTIMIDATED AND LEFT UNSUPPORTED REPORT FROM MY OLD ON LAW SCHOOL ALLEGE THAT NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF ACTIVE ACTIVE ACTIVITIES AMONG EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT CLIQUES IN LOS ANGELES ALONE SOME OF THEM HAVE TAX USE. HAND SIGNALS RITUALS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE CRIMINAL STREET GANGS THAT EXIST IN OUR STATE ALLOWING A CULTURE OF POLICE CLICKS TO CONTINUE IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO BUILDING AND PRESERVING THE TRUST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS ALSO DANGEROUS THIS IS ALSO DANGER IN THE REPUTATION OF GOOD POLICE OFFICERS AS A WHOLE MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE ON A. B. NINE FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON MISTER LACK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AB NINE FIFTY EIGHT. THE BILL THAT WOULD HOLD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR BOTH WHILE IN AND OUT OF UNIFORM. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL DANGEROUS JOBS IN THE NATION. BUT THIS IS NO EXCUSE FOR A GROUP OF OFFICERS WERE TAKEN ILLICIT. OR VERY DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR. IT IS A POLICE OFFICER'S DUTY TO STAND IN LINE OF DANGER TO BE A SOURCE OF SAFETY. AND A CRISIS. OFFICERS A PARTICIPATING GAINES REAL LEGAL CLINICS OF NO PLACE IN FORCING THE LAWS OF THE STATE. IF WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW HOW CAN WE ALSO VERY IS TO ABIDE BY IT. WHETHER IN UNIFORM OR NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS MUST BE AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS PARTAKING IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE PERMITTED. BY ACTIVELY ROOTING OUT BAD ACTORS THE STATE WILL ENSURE THAT ONLY QUALIFIED EXCEPTIONAL OFFICERS. ARE POLICING OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LACKEY SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER GETS IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OF HERE I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE.

WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK UP IN FILE ORDER TO FILE ITEM EIGHTY FIVE AB SEVEN OH ONE THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY RULE SEVEN A WORN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ AN ACCOLADE TO EMPLOYMENT. FIFTEEN DOLLARS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I GOTTA BE HONEST- WE SHOULDN'T NEED A BILL LIKE AB SEVEN A ONE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL THE BIGGEST CORPORATION IN THE WORLD THAT THEY NEED TO ALLOW THEIR WORKERS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM OR WASH THEIR HANDS. IT IS ATROCIOUS THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BILL LIKE THIS BUT THE HONESTY IS THAT WE HAVE A CORPORATION WHO IS RUNNING WAREHOUSES AND IT'S CREATED A SYSTEM BY WHICH WORKERS ARE GETTING INJURED AT TWICE THE RATE OF OTHER WAREHOUSES THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OTHER EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG. WHAT AB SEVEN OH ONE WILL DO IS ENSURE THAT LARGE WAREHOUSES WAREHOUSES WITH OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE EMPLOYED AT THE WAREHOUSE OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE. HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE WORKERS IF THEY HAVE A QUOTA. WHAT THAT QUOTA IS. AND IF THEY DON'T MEET THAT QUOTA WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. IT REQUIRES THAT ANY HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS SUCH AS GOING TO THE BATHROOM OR WASH YOUR HANDS ISN'T COUNTED AGAINST THAT QUOTA. AND FINALLY DIRECTS OSHA TO ENSURE THAT THESE NEW. ALGORITHM DRIVEN WAREHOUSES HAVE SAFETY STANDARDS SO WE CAN STOP PEOPLE FROM GETTING HURT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE FUTURE OF LOGISTICS AND WAREHOUSES IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE. AND IT'S BEYOND DOING WHAT HAS BECOME UNFORTUNATELY A VERY DANGEROUS JOB. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A. B. SEVEN OH ONE. THANK YOU MISTER DOLLARS MISTER SMITH YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

THIS BILL WOULD DO NOTHING BUT DRIVE UP THE COST FOR BUSINESSES WHO ARE IN THE BEST OF REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY AFTER THE COVERT PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION TO DRIVING UP COST OF DOING BUSINESS. SICKNESS ALONG TO THE CONSUMERS. THIS BILL ALSO INCENTIVIZES FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BASED ON VAGUE STANDARDS AND THE EMPLOYER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY ATTORNEY FEES EVEN IF THE EMPLOYEE IS UNSUCCESSFUL. SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE OUT OF BREATH WITH THE INCREASING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES ARE KNOCKED OUT TO GET EMPLOYEES IN FACT A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY THE WORK INSTITUTE ESTIMATE THE COST OF EMPLOYEES TURN OVER RICK EVALUATES. 35% OF THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. I DO IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR A COMPANY TO IMPOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT LEAD TO HIGHER RATES OF INJURIES OR TERMINATIONS AS THIS BILL SUGGEST. MANY OF US IN THIS CHAMBER CAMPAIGN ONS SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES HIRED THOUGH NO VOTE ON AB SEVEN A ONE. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH IS FOR COOLEY IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. COLLEAGUES I DON'T CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS BILL I'M PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF IT.

AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. A CONTACT WHATEVER SETTING THEY FIND THEMSELVES PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES. OF RESPECT AND OF. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT IS THE MEASURE PERFORMANCE.

SECONDLY THERE IS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THE PARTY HAS TO PREVAIL IN ORDER FOR ATTORNEY FEES- TO BE AWARDED IN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN OTHER WORDS IF IT IF THAT THE WORKERS IT'S JUST SUING TO STOP THE BEHAVIOR THIS IS NOT- A PERFECT PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC PAGA THIS IS A AS A- AS GENTLE AS WE CAN DO ENFORCEMENT IF YOU WILL- THIS IS NOT SMALL BUSINESSES WERE TALKING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A LARGE WAREHOUSES.
