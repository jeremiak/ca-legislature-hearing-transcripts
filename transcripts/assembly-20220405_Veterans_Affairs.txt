AND UPON ARRIVAL IN VIETNAM WAS ASSIGNED TO COMPANY A FIRST TO TWELFTH FIRST CAV DIVISION- I WAS WOUNDED ON AUGUST TWENTY SECOND OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHILE CLEARING THREE VC OUT OF A CAVE ON THE EDGE OF THE BOUNCE ON PLANE I TOOK TO A K. ROUNDS I SPENT FIFTY WEEKS AND HOSPITALS IN VIETNAM THE PHILIPPINES OKINAWA JAPAN AND FINALLY LETTERMAN HOSPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WAS RETIRED AFTER T. D. R. L. FROM THE ARMY WITH DISABILITY DUE TO WOUNDS RECEIVED IN JANUARY OF NINETEEN SEVENTY. I'VE SPENT MANY YEARS NOW SERVING VETERANS. THROUGH MY MEMBERSHIP IN THE MILITARY OR THE PURPLE HEART. IT'S GOOD RECORDING GOOD AND REWARDING WORK THAT SHOULD HAVE ENDED A LONG TIME AGO. I'VE BEEN I'VE SEEN ANOTHER GENERATION NOW GO THROUGH THE SAME TRIALS AS MY BROTHER AND I HAVE IT IN TOWARD AND WE DIED TO PRESERVE FREEDOM AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION AND WE CONTINUE FIGHTING TO THIS DAY FOR OUR LIBERTY. WE DON'T SEE COMPLETE SUPPORT FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW A REAL AMERICAN DOES. BUT WHAT WE SEEK IS PEACE OF MIND FOR OUR FAMILIES. SUPPORT FOR DISABLED BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT IS DUE FOR THE PRICE WE PAID. WELL THE CURRENT LAW OFFERS SOME PROTECTIONS IN RELIEF FOR OLDER VETS THE SITUATION FOR THIS SERVICE RETURNING VETERANS IS FAR MORE SEVERE THIS HOUSING COSTS ABOUT P. STUDENT INFO OUTPACED INFLATION. WITH THE CURRENT RATE SET TO BE ADJUSTED ONLY BY INFLATION THESE NEW VETERANS WHO ARE OFTEN GRAVELY DISABLED. ALREADY HUGE DISADVANTAGE POSSIBLY OWNING A HOME. AND USING THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. THIS IS A REAL SITUATION THAT WE ARE FACING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO SHOULD BE DONE. THIS BILL WILL HELP TENS OF THOUSANDS GET CLOSER TO THAT DAY. THE EYES OF EVERY VETERAN I SPOKE TO LIT UP WHEN I TALK TO ABOUT THIS BILL AND THERE WERE DOZENS OF THE- PLEASE CONSIDER AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE. DAHLE TWENTY NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU.

IF YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU'RE LUCKY. IS A WHERE YOU LIVE. SO POINT I'M MAKING IS THIS. BILL IS VITAL WE NEED IT N. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO OFFER. THE CHAIR MYSELF AND THE COMMITTEE THAT END UP IN THE FUTURE WE MAY WANT TO BRING A BILL THAT'S BASED UPON PERCENT OF DISABILITY. BECAUSE NOT THAT MANY VETERANS GET A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND IF YOU GO 290% INSTEAD OF THIRTY THREE HUNDRED A MONTH YOU GET LIKE. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND THEN IT GOES DOWN DRAMATICALLY FROM THERE. SOUL A PROPERTY TAX RELIEF. IS ESSENTIAL YES SAY SIR YES SIR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE OF THE OTHER CARD I'M SORRY HIS LETTER I'M JUST GONNA ADD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A 100% RATING UNLESS IT'S THE FIRST RATING YOU GET.
