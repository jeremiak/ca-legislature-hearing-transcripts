WE'RE SQUANDERING.

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:56.448 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:58.550 region:rollup2
INDISCRIMINATE MASS KILLING

00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:00.252 region:rollup2
DEVICES.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.654 region:rollup2
ANY USE WOULD BE ILLEGITIMATE

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:04.189 region:rollup2
AND WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE.

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:05.557 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG AND PROUD

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:07.359 region:rollup2

NATIONWIDE.

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:14.333 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY AJ OUR THIRTY THREE

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:17.536 region:rollup2
THE RESOLUTION LAYS OUT SOME OF

00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:18.937 region:rollup2
THE CATASTROPHIC HUMANITARIAN

00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:20.005 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD OCCUR

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:21.607 region:rollup2
SHOULD NUCLEAR WEAPONS BE USED

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:23.242 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:27:21.607 --> 00:27:24.943 region:rollup2
I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH PEOPLE

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:26.178 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE BEEN

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:27.880 region:rollup2
DEEPLY IMPACTED BY NUCLEAR

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:29.715 region:rollup2
WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT TESTING IN

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.483 region:rollup2
USE AND EVERYONE OF THEM TELLS

00:27:29.715 --> 00:27:33.018 region:rollup2
ME THE SAME THING.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.987 region:rollup2
WE MUST PUT AN END TO NUCLEAR

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:37.222 region:rollup2
WEAPONS SO THAT NO ONE EVER

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:38.757 region:rollup2
SUFFERS THE SAME FATE.

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:40.025 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE OF

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:42.094 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW HAVE

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:44.863 region:rollup2
A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:45.898 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS NOBLE GOAL.

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.999 region:rollup2
FOR FIFTY YEARS THE U. S. HAS

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:48.600 region:rollup2
BEEN PART OF THE NUCLEAR

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:49.968 region:rollup2
NONPROLIFERATION TREATY WHICH

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.136 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.970 region:rollup2
AT PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:53.505 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO ADDITIONAL

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.207 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.975 region:rollup2
BUT IT HAS FAILED TO COMPEL THE

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:58.944 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR ARMS STATES TO FULFILL

00:27:56.975 --> 00:28:00.746 region:rollup2
THEIR OBLIGATION TO NEGOTIATE IN

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:01.914 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH FOR AN END TO THE

00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:03.949 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND FOR

00:28:01.914 --> 00:28:05.384 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.

00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:07.119 region:rollup2
THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO NATIONS

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:08.754 region:rollup2
THAT VOTED IN FAVOR OF ADOPTING

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:10.923 region:rollup2
THE TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:13.058 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE COMPLYING

00:28:10.923 --> 00:28:14.526 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO ACT.

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.828 region:rollup2
THE U. S. WAS SHAMEFULLY HOSTILE

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:17.696 region:rollup2
TO THIS PROCESS THE VAST

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.164 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S

00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:21.300 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES ARE MOVING FORWARD TO

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:22.568 region:rollup2
OUTLAW IN STIGMATIZED NUCLEAR

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.636 region:rollup2
WEAPONS POSSESSION IN THE U. S.

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:26.305 region:rollup2
IS BEING LEFT BEHIND.

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:27.306 region:rollup2
THIS EMERGING LEGAL NORM AGAINST

00:28:26.305 --> 00:28:29.174 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL ONLY GET

00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:30.542 region:rollup2
STRONGER.

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:32.578 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY THE

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:34.213 region:rollup2
ENTIRE UNITED STATES MUST GET ON

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:35.781 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.

00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:37.182 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE MUST DO

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:38.317 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:39.418 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BEFORE

NUCLEAR WEAPONS LAST SUMMER.

00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:32.504 region:rollup2
THE TREATY MAKES CLEAR THAT

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:34.339 region:rollup2
NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSE HORRIFIC

00:29:32.504 --> 00:29:37.142 region:rollup2
HUMANITARIAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:39.544 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE LEGALLY

00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:27.979 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IS RISKY.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:29.814 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY AND UNJUSTIFIED.

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:30.415 region:rollup2

ADOPT SUCH CHANGES.

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:50.602 region:rollup2

THINGS THAT WE MIGHT CHANGE.

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:27.258 region:rollup2
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:29.794 region:rollup2
REALIZE IS THAT WE HAD A FIRST

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:31.329 region:rollup2
USE POLICY IN THE COLD WAR

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:33.331 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:36.267 region:rollup2
THE SOVIET UNION --

00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:38.569 region:rollup2

ABILITY.

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:51.115 region:rollup2
NOT CLEAR THAT THEY EVER DID.

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:53.184 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS HAV RELIC FROM THE

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.952 region:rollup2
COLD WAR SHOULD BE ABOLISHED I'M

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:57.588 region:rollup2
