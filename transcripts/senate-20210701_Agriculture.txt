CAN YOU PLEASE- BEGIN BY PRESENTING YOUR BILL A. B. FOUR FIVE. FRAZIER WILL IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AB FORTY FIVE CREATES A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA IN FOODS BEVERAGES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IT LIMITS HIM PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE NO MORE THAN THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT OF THC REQUIRES THAT HEMP PRODUCERS BE SUBJECT TO TESTING AND LABELING REQUIREMENTS. FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FEDERAL FARM BILL CLARIFIED THAT INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IN REMOVED INGREDIENTS AND HELP FROM THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULES. THIS% ACTION CLASSIFIED HAVE INGREDIENTS AS JOINT SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND OPEN THE DOORS FOR FARMERS TO CULTIVATE INDUSTRIAL HEMP. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LEGALIZE CANNABIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL. IRONICALLY WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MOVE BARRIERS TO THE LEGAL TO THE LEGAL USE OF HEMP DERIVED PRODUCTS. INCLUDING CBD CALIFORNIA HAS NOT TAKEN A SIMILAR APPROACH. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE MANUFACTURING AND SALES OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTS INCLUDING FOOD AND DRINKS. YEAH WHEN HIM IS THE SOURCE OF CBD TO BE ADDED TO THE PRODUCTS IT IS PROHIBITED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PURCHASING HIM DRIVE CBD PRODUCTS AT THEIR LOCAL NATURAL FOOD STORES FITNESS CENTERS AND EVEN HIGH END DEPARTMENT STORES FOR SOME TIME. AND THESE PRODUCTS ARE UNREGULATED. IN FACT SENIORS ARE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POPULATION. ARE CHOOSING TO USE HEMP CBD BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO VISIT THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY. THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF CBD DERIVED FROM HEMP IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. SHOULD THE CHANGE SAID THAT SHOULD THE STATE CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THAT HEMP CBD PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL AND FOR SALE AND CONSUMPTION BUSINESSES AND THE TAX REVENUES ARE LOST. WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE WILD WILD WEST FOR CBD PRODUCTS NOW ONLINE AND IN STORES UNWITTINGLY SELLING UNREGULATED PRODUCTS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE MY CONSTITUENTS BUYING UNTESTED UNREGULATED OUT OF STATE FOR FOREIGN PRODUCTS. THEY ARE UNSAFE WELL OUR FARMERS AND BUSINESSES LOSE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. WELL AB FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS IT NANAK INTOXICATING ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT. THAT CONSUMERS WANT FOR FARMERS TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A FAST GROWING INDUSTRY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AROUND MARTIN AND HE'S HERE WITH US THIS MORNING FROM THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE AND FOR ANY BERNACCHI WILL BE ON THE TELEPHONE RIVERS IN THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL. ALL RIGHT WELL NOW WHAT THANK YOU HELLO TAKE TESTIMONY ON THE BILL DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECH AND CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS. MAY INSTITUTE- TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY IN OUR CASE EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED IN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME OF TWO MINUTES PER PERSON FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR FOR EACH SIDE. LIMIT- WILL BE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IGOR CURRIES. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO IN REVERSE ORDERS FIRST WITNESS WILL BE MISTER RAND- MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE. WELCOME THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AROUND ONE ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE WE HAD A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHEN YOU HEARD SB TWO THIRTY FIVE. MAYBE FORTY FIVE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL I WILL POINT OUT ONE BIG CHANGE THAT WAS MADE TO THE BILL'S SUBSEQUENT TO MY- TO. BILLION OR A TO MOST WHEN I. ARCHITECT WE HAVE A- OR OPEN LAW. OKAY. AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S BETTER. SECOND. THIS IS WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE ELEVATOR MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND. I HAVE BEEN NOTICING. IN YOUR FANTASTIC BAKER WILL ADD THAT TO YOUR LIST OF TALENTS NO DOUBT ALL RIGHT I THINK- LET'S MOVE AHEAD AS APOLOGIZE FOR THE WAY NO PROBLEM NO PROBLEM LOTS OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THESE DAYS. AS I WAS SAYING AB FORTY FIVE IS VIRTUALLY THE SAME AS SB TWO THIRTY FIVE ONE MAJOR CHANGE IT WAS TAKEN TO TWO THIRTY FIVE AND IS ALSO RECORD REFLECTED IN AB FORTY FIVE THE FARM BUREAU HAD EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS- TWO MONTHS AGO WE HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT HAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE REAL QUICKLY THAT THERE'S THREE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO WITH THIS BILL. NUMBER ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS LEGALLY ACCESSIBLE BY CONSUMERS OF THEY'RE NOT BUYING A KNOWN PRODUCT ONLINE WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW- IT PROVIDES A LOT OF CONSUMER SAFETY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING TESTING- AND LABEL WARNING LABEL SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING- IN A JUMPSTART AN INDUSTRY THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY FRUITFUL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF TAX REVENUE. BUT ALSO JOBS FROM ONE INTO THE STATE TO THE OTHER I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE THREE THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF NUMBER ONE SOME OF THE OPPONENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE CANNABIS LICENSEES IN THIS BILL WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS WELL THAT IS AN ISSUE WE CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. BUT WE REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING A ROOM ON BOARD WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL INSTEAD INSTEAD OF BEING DIVIDED OVER THE ISSUE THAT WE ALL AGREE ON. NUMBER TWO IS THAT THERE IS TESTING PARITY VERY EXPLICIT I'M IN THE BILL THAT WE HAVE TO TEST TO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS- AS CANNABIS CAN'T GET ANYMORE TESTING PARITY THAN THAT- AND NUMBER THREE IS THAT WE ARE PROHIBITED AS CANNABIS IN TERMS OF MAKING MEDICAL CLAIMS- THAT PARKLAND SUBSTANTIATED AND WE CAN BE PULLED OFF OF US STORE SHELVES IF WE IF WE SAY THINGS ARE NOT MEDICALLY VALIDATED. SO WITH THOSE THINGS SAID WE APPRECIATE YOUR AIMAL SUPPORT TWO MONTHS AGO WE HOPE WE CAN GET YOUR SUPPORT {IN BROWN THANK YOU MISTER MARTIN. ALL RIGHT- MOVING TO- AT ASSEMBLY.

ACROSS EVERY LEVEL ONCE THAT WAS ISSUED- PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF CULTIVATION WHICH LOST SIGNIFICANT OUTLET FOR THEIR BIOMASS- SO IT REALLY DAMAGE THE FARMERS. OF HIM WHEN THAT I THANK YOU WITH ISSUED- YOU THIS MEASURE ALREADY AUTHORIZES THE USE OF HIM CONSTRUED BEVERAGES- BROUGHT INTO BETTER PRODUCTS- IN DOING SO WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT PATH FORWARD. FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO EXPAND INTO THE HEMP INDUSTRY- IN ADDITION THE BILL CREATES A REGULATORY STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS RELATED TO HEMP. DERIVED PRODUCTS- INCLUDING TESTING LABELING AND HEARINGS TO THE SHERMAN ACT- WHICH IS INCORRECT AND THE- CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH- IN FINALLY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE COUNCIL IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVISIONS IN THE BILL- WE ALSO SUPPORT THE REASON AMENDMENTS TAKEN BY A MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY- THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY ON THE CONFORM TO FEDERAL LAW ON THE CAP OF.

HOWEVER FROM OUT OF STATE INTERESTS HAVE BEGUN PURCHASING BROWN'S WHOSE NAMES INCLUDE CALIFORNIA ORREGIONAL NAMES AND BLENDING THOSE OILS WITH INTERNATIONAL OILS. THE WORST PRACTITIONERS ARE MARKING THEMSELVES OF CALIFORNIA GROWN AND USING AS LITTLE AS 14% OF CALIFORNIA ALL BOILS IN THEIR PLANS. CHEAPER INTERNATIONAL ALL OF UNDER CUT CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND BRANDS MUST ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR AND CONSUMER STANDARDS IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW MEMBERS WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR FAMILY FARMERS IN THIS CAPITAL BUT FRANKLY. WE DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT TO PROTECT THEM IN THE MARKET PLACE.

THERE'S A LABEL ALREADY ON THIS THIS IS A 100% CALIFORNIA ALL OF THIS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER. HAS THE ABILITY TO VISUALLY LOOK AT IT VERY EASILY WHEN IT'S ON THE SHELF. WHAT IF WHAT IT IS THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN THAT SOME. BUT DO OTHER BLENDS. AND IT MIGHT BE ONLY UP 214% OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF WILL AND SO I THINK IT'S MISLEADING- QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW ME I MEAN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET THE RIGHT THINGS THAT THEY'RE PURCHASING. AND I PROTECT OUR SMALL FOR OUR- FARMERS SO. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THANK WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR GLAZERS. I WILL FIRST- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- REALLY TRYING TO PROTECT THE BRAND- THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US YEARS CALIFORNIA BEYOND OLIVE OIL- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SET SUCH INCREDIBLE COMMODITIES AND- WONDERFULLY FARMED AND- AT THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN TRYING TO. DO THAT IN THIS BILL AND I KNOW IT'S OF A GOAL OF OURS TO DO THAT A LOT OF OTHER SPACES HERE- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING ON ON THIS BILL AND TRYING TO FIND COMPETITION- ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR I THINK THAT THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. I DID WANT TO ASK IN AND MAYBE. IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO THE CHAIR BUT YOU CAN STILL INDICATE TO WALK THROUGH THIS THIS FINAL LAST WORDING ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME I'M- I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL. I'M LOOKING ON PAGE FOUR- LINE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. I SEE WHAT'S THERE AND I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT'S ALLEGED COUNCIL LANGUAGE IF THERE'S INJECTION TO END AND. IF YOU COULD CLARIFY THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME. SPECIFICITY. WELL I DON'T. IS NOT WORKING SO WELL. YEAH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU WISH TO ADD TO THE ELEMENT THEY HAVE THE PERCENT SHALL BE DECLARED BY THE WORDS CONTAINING OR CONTAINS PERCENT I LOVE TO BLANK CALIFORNIA ALL OF WELL PERCENT THAT WAS A PIECE WAS LEFT IN THERE WHAT WHAT'S THE OBJECTION THAT THAT'S BEEN RAISED ABOUT THIS LANGUAGE. YOUR BORDERS YOU HAVE WITH THE STATE CALIFORNIA THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES. I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD- ONE OF THE- ON PRINCIPLES ALL RIGHT IN OPPOSITION- SAY THAT MORE CLEARLY. THANK YOU. SO WE'VE SO WE'VE AGREED FULLY TO THE FRONT OF THE BACK LABEL IN A PERCENT CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE LINE UP AND DO THAT THE FIRST SENTENCE THE SECOND SENTENCE THEM THEN. LET'S COUNCIL MY UNDERSTANDING TALKING WITH THE CONSULTANT SIDE TO FURTHER EXPLAIN THAT. AND SO IT REQUIRES THE WORD CONTAINS ARE CONTAINING AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL WORDS ALL OF OIL. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IT'S JUST PRESCRIPTIVE AND THIS WILL HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME EXACT SIZE. AS THE LARGEST THE GOVERNMENT NOT JUST TO TURN CALIFORNIA WHICH AGAIN AND THE PERCENTAGE WE FULLY ACCEPT THAT. AND THEN THAT'S THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT WHAT'S THAT AGREEMENT WENT TO ALLEGE COUNCIL THEY ADDED IN THIS FURTHER CLARIFICATION THE YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE TERMS CONTAINS ARE CONTAINING. AND THEN THE DOCTOR THE ALL WHEEL IN THE SAME FOUGHT IN THAT AREA WE WILL OBVIOUSLY WE PROTECT VIRGIN ON ON OUR ON OUR LABELS EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL IS THE- IS THE LARGEST STATEMENT. ON THAT I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROMOTION BUT WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THIS FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE TERMS CONTAINS OKAY AND ALL OF OIL IT WOULD WOULD COME OUT AND THEN WE COULD LABEL JUST PERCENT CALIFORNIA'S LATEST BABY NOT QUESTION THE CONSOLE BECAUSE IT SEEMS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL GIVES YOU OPTIONS THERE. IT HAS THE WORD. IS THAT CORRECT THAT THAT BILL PROOF THAT THIS PROPOSED. I THINK IT IS LINES IT HAS IT BUT THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT SAYS THAT THAT SHOULD BE DECLARED BY THE WORDS CONTAINING OR CONTAINS LIKE PERCENT CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. OR IT WOULD SAY LIKE 10% CALIFORNIA ALL. AND SO I THINK THE CONCERN WAS THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TO WORRY WHEN IT HAS TO BE THE SAME SIZE AND FONT RIGHT BUT IS IT IS IT. IS THAT. IS THERE A WORRYING CONTAINING OR CONTAIN REQUIRED TO BE AND THE DISCLOSURE OR CAN THEY JUST PUT THE PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL YEAH AND THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE A WE PUT IN THE THEY SHALL USE THEY SHALL BE DECLARED BY THE WORDS IN LINE TWENTY SIX. IT SAYS THE PERCENTAGE SHALL BE DECLARED BY THE WORDS AND WE WERE PRESCRIPTIVE AND PUTTING THAT IN FOR WHAT IS THE WORD OR LINE TWENTY SEVEN MAKE THAT. IDEA SAID OR THEY SPELL OUT PERCENT OR YOU CAN USE THE PERCENTAGE SIGN. EITHER OR- SO IT'S EITHER OR- HERE YOU CAN EITHER SAVE. CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL OR YOU CAN SPELL OUT PERCENT C. TEN. E. R. C. NT CALIFORNIA. OKAY AM I AND WHAT WHAT IS THE WORD CONTAINING WHAT'S THE VALUE WHAT LIES THAT IN THERE IF YOU'RE PUTTING THE PERCENTAGE CALIFORNIA ALL OR WHAT IS THE WORD CONTAINED. DEAN JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. PURPOSES AND THAT'S HOW WE RUN IT OUT. I THINKING OF. HIS WHAT I SAID TO THEM WE WANT TO SURE SAID IT CAN TAKE. 20% ALL THE WHILE YEAH SO I APPRECIATE FROM THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL THAT AFTERWARDS. THEY SHOULD MATTER. AND SO I GUESS I'M HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING AND I GUESS I GO TO THE CHAIR. CHEROKEE MAYBE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW ON THIS SURPRISE THE WORD CONTAIN MATTER CAN BE WORKED. WITH OF BEING PRESCRIPTIVE HERE. IT IS A LABEL IT'S A SMALL OFFICE SPACE SO WHY DOES CONTAIN MATTER. I THINK- BECAUSE THIS WAS A LAST MINUTE- REVELATION WHEN IT WENT THROUGH THE VILLAGE COUNCIL PROCESS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PARTIES. ARE IN AGREEMENT ON ISRAEL BEYOND IF AND ASSEMBLY. WOMAN IN MISTER BROWN- THAT WHEN THIS MOVES TO THE NEXT PHASE THAT THERE WILL BE- RESOLUTION TO THIS VERY VERY SMALL ISSUE ON PERCENT. CALIFORNIA IS THAT CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT. WE GET MY VERY FIRST PROPOSAL THAT I HAD COME THROUGH HERE WAS MUCH LESS WORDY AND THE PROPOSAL OUT SPECIFIED. MATHIS THE CITY. OF FOR DISCLOSURE FOR THE CONSUMERS NOW SO THERE IS. IT'S FORTY AND- ELEMENT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT IN THERE BUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE WORD CONTAINS CORRECT. YEAH WHICH DOESN'T NEED TO BE THERE. NECESSARILY YEAH. OKAY BY. ALL OF OUR WITH THE AS WELL. SO PER DAY YOU CAN. IN ALL THESE YEARS ARE EXAMPLES OF TO CHECK FOR EXAMPLE WOULD SAY. A GLOBAL THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY WELL PUT OUT AS WELL. AS A GLOBAL AND OF ALL OF OILS FROM. ARJUN CHILE. PORTUGAL IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE CHANGED TO SAY A GLOBAL ONE OF CALL OF ALL OF OILS FROM ARGENTINA. CHILE PORTUGAL. AND TEN FOUR VIEWS IN HER EXAMPLE 14% OR 25% CALIFORNIA. REITERATING NOT ONLY CHANGE BUT THE TERM ALL OF OIL AGAIN AND THAT LARGE PRINT. IN THAT EXACT PART. BOB IS HIS PRESCRIPTIONS AND UNNECESSARY AGAIN THAT'S WHERE MUCH OF THE OLIVE OIL. BOB WILL BE ON THE ON THE PACKAGE AND IT'S FRANKLY LARGE JUST AT THAT DISCLOSURE. THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTAIN THOSE TERMS AT THAT SIZE IN THAT AREA AND SO WE JUST. GOT AS IF YOU TAKE OUT THE SECOND IT STILL REQUIRES US TO DO PERCENT CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD GO ON WOULD PROBABLY BE SOMETHING LIKE I MEAN. FULL DISCLOSURE GLOBAL BLEND OF. ALL OF THE OILS FROM. UNIVERSITY PORCH. CHILE AND TWENTY FIVE ZERO WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE WE CLEAR. MISTER BROWN AS WELL AS ALSO WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT IT WILL HAVE. EIGHTEEN NINE EIGHTY EIGHT A NUMBER. WITH EITHER THE WORD PERCENT FOR THE SYMBOL PERCENT CALIFORNIA. IF YOU WOULD JUST IT FOR MY CLARITY MISTER CHAIR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT JUST STRIKING THE WORD CONTAINS IS THAT ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- WE TALKED ABOUT MORE CHANGES. I'M I'M I'M THIS WAS A LAD THIS WAS A LAST MINUTE- AND- DEVELOPMENT ON THE WORD CONTAINED THE THREATENS TO SHUT. THE PRESCRIBED WE'RE REQUESTING. IS THE MOMENT SENATE BILL WELL I WOULDN'T I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR IF WERE A WITNESS IS GOING TO BE SPEAKING THEY SHOULD BE DOING IT ON THE MIKE. I AGREE OKAY OKAY SORRY THANK YOU SEVENTH. WELL THAT'S IT. IF YOU REMOVE THAT SENSE THAT'S ONE OPTION. THROUGH THAT SENDS. IT WILL STILL SAY THAT AS WE PERCENT CALIFORNIA'S SIZE THAT IS NO LESS THAN THE LARGEST FONT USED TO PRINT CALIFORNIA ON THE SAME PANEL. SO WE WOULD REQUEST REMOVING SENSE WHAT THAT WOULD REMOVE IS BOTH THE CONTAINS. AN IN THE STATEMENT ALL OF OIL THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN THE SAME FOUGHT IN SAME SIDE. AS IN THAT DISCLOSURE. WHAT WHAT WOODS THEN IT WOULD SAY PERCENT CALIFORNIA. JUST LIKE IT SAYS CHILE ARGENTINA OR OR WHATEVER. AND THOUGH THERE THE TO THE ALL OF OIL AS WELL BEING IN THE SAME LARGE FONT. MAYBE IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER ON THE LABEL IN ANOTHER SPOT. BUT THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THIS DISCLOSURE WE DON'T THINK CALL OF OIL OR CONTAINS. SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED IN STATUTE. RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT BYE MA'AM YES SIR BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE ISSUE WAS ONLY THAT CONTAIN RIGHT NOW- MISS ROBBIE ANI'S ADDED A SECOND ISSUE HERE. ON THE ISSUE OF CONTAINS I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM- THAT THE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S AN EXTRA WORD TO ME- I NEED ALL OF THE OIL I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT- AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT BEING SO PRESCRIPTIVE. AND IF IT SAYS ALL OF WELL IN TERMS OF THE SETTINGS IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S REASONABLE TO ME BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S FOLLOW UP TO THE CHAIR AND THEN. THE AND THE SPONSORED THE BILL CAN CAN WORK ON- AFTER THIS BUT ON THE WORD CONTAINS I'D BE COMFORTABLE ELIMINATING THAT PARTICULAR WORD IF THERE'S AGREEMENT. UNITED AND I WOULD BE FINE- WITH THAT WHEN WOULD THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING- ON THE PARAMETERS OF THIS- I THINK IT WAS A LAST MINUTE DEVELOPMENT WITH LUNCH COUNCIL LANGUAGE BUT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT- WE HAVE WE HAVE MOVED. SO MANY MOUNTAINS ON- ON THIS PARTICULAR. ISSUE- MISTER BROWN AND ASSEMBLY SUFFER. I WOULD LIKE TO. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF OBJECTION DO YOU HAVE A STRONG OBJECTION TO THAT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO- REMOVING THE WORD- CONTAINING- IF APPROVED BY THE AUTHOR. WHAT I LIKE T REMIND THE COMMITTEE OF. THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY. IS A LACK OF SPECIFICITY IN EXISTING LAW THAT CREATED A LOOPHOLE FOR THE USE OF THE TERM CALIFORNIA INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE IS BEEN THE INTENT OF STATE LAW SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. AND SO. I THINK NOW WE'VE LEARNED IT'S BETTER TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF GREATER SPECIFICITY. OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IN THIS BOTTLE AND WITH THAT WE WOULD PREFER THAT IT CONTINUES TO SAY PERCENT. CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL WHEN IT'S A BLENDED BOTTLE OF OLIVE OIL THE WORD CONTAINING. CAN BE SEEN AS EXTRA AND UNNECESSARY AND IF THE AUTHOR AGREES WITH IT WE HAVE NO OBJECTION. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY ONE. LET'S JUST MAKE IT CLEAR THE POINT IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA BRANCH SHOULD BE CLUB DISCLOSED ON HOW CALIFORNIA IS ON FOR THE FOR THE CONSUMER TO LOOK AT SO I HAVE TO AGREE I MEAN I AGREE WITH- MISTER BROWN ON- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO I'M NOT GONNA DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; OF SORBET REALLY THINK.&lt;/c&gt; WE NEED TO BE REALLY CLEAR ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND WE TRY TO BE CLEAR PRIOR TO THIS AMENDMENT AND I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY NOT NOT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN THE FROM OF THAT LABEL BUT IT JUST HAS TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS CALIFORNIA BRAND MUST SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. ON HOW CALIFORNIA IS FOR THE CONSUMERS FOR CONSUMER. CHOICE SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING ON. OKAY BRING IT BRING IT BACK. SIR HAVE A YEAR YEAH IT'S ALWAYS DANGEROUS TO WALK INTO A FOOD FIGHT WITH ADS- YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S BEEN GOING ON LET ME JUST SAY THAT- HUH YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE WITH. WITH- EIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY IS SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR. IF YOU KNOW YOUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THIS- AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO THAT. ANY TIME THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT AND YOU END UP IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AND IT'S USUALLY A JUDGE- THE STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION IS THAT WE MEAN EXACTLY WHAT THE WORDS MEAN AND THAT IF WE ADDED EXTRA WORDS WE MEANT THOSE EXTRA WORDS TO MEAN SOMETHING SO. I ALWAYS ERR ON IT ON THE SIDE OF LET'S MAKE IT SIMPLE. AND AND CLEAR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE THE MORE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE BUYING WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE. THE BETTER IT IS- AND- SO I FRANKLY DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE ENTIRE SENTENCE BUT I AM PREPARED TO- TO- TO SUPPORT EITHER THAT OR OR THAT CONTINUE GETTING RID OF THE WORDS CONTAINING SO- I DON'T KNOW FOR MOTIONS BEEN MADE BUT- BUT IF IT HAS. IF IT HAS NOT- I'M PREPARED TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE JUST TAKE THE SENT TO SEND US OR WE ADVISE IT THAT'S WHAT WE THINK SHOULD BE DONE IT GOES TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE NOT CONNECTS COMMISSION OFF. OFF ALWAYS DECIDE WHETHER THEY LIKE IT IN THERE OR NOT I MEAN IT. IT'S NOT. I THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR BOTH. BOTH OPTIONS BUT I THINK THE STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION IS SUCH THAT WE SHOULD JUST TAKE THE SENTENCE OUT. OKAY RECOMMEND I'M OKAY WITH THAT YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WEIRD THIS MATTER EVEN IN ITS LAST MINUTE- MANIFESTATION WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING THAT THIS PARTICULAR SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE RESOLVED- THROUGH THE NEXT THROUGH THE NEXT CMMITTEE HAVING GONE THROUGH SO MANY. CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL DRAFT SO I THINK YOU CAN KIND OF GET A SENSE THAT- BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD THAT TO WORK CONTAINS. IS SUPERFLUOUS BOND IN PERCENTAGE CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL IS- APPROPRIATE. BUT I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE AUTHOR ODD TO RESOLVE. THIS VERY VERY SMALL ISSUE COMPARED TO WHERE WE STARTED FROM. AS IT MOVES THROUGH ON THE NEXT COMMITTEE ANY OTHER FOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS. AND MISSOURI I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THE SENTENCE ABOVE TALKS ABOUT THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGE WHICH I ALWAYS THOUGHT WAS A- SAFER PHRASE MYSELF BECAUSE OF THE GOOD PROTECTED THE- PRODUCER FROM ANY KIND OF LITIGATION THAT WAS AN EXACT. AND SO I WANT TO GO OUT ON JOIN WITH CENTER CABALLERO INSANE I THINK THAT SENSES EXTRA. IT KIND OF ITS VISIT I THINK TOO PRESCRIPTIVE I THINK THAT IT DOES REQUIRE THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF OLIVE OIL AND THE SIZE AS THE WORD CALIFORNIA GETS A VERY CLEAR AND POWERFUL. AND I THINK THAT SENDS THIS EXTRA AND AGAIN. DEPENDING ON MY COLLEAGUES AND HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOTION WITH THAT. IT CAN YOU CAN LEAVE US A FIVE THE SENTENCE SO WE'RE ON THE SAME ON THE SAME DAY JUST AT THE END CENTER COPYRIGHT TO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IN THE SENSE BEGINS. ONLINE TWENTY FIVE OF THE WORD DOT. AND THEN IT CAN. TO LAW TWENTY- THAT THAT'S A- SEEMS TO BE A CLARIFICATION OF WHAT'S ABOVE. AND WHAT'S ABOVE SEEMS TO BE CLEAR AS TO WHAT'S REQUIRED ON THE LABEL. I WOULD AGREE THEY ACTUALLY RIGHT SO- FROM THERE AND- I WOULD JUST SAY IT TO DO A BEHOLDEN ON THE FLYBRIDGE OF THIS ARE GOING TO BE A RECOMMENDATION BUT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STILL HAS TO HAS TO TALK WITH THIS SUPPORTERS AND SPONSORS AND SEE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT BUT WHAT WHAT YOU AS I INITIALLY PROPOSING. IS TO TAKE AT LEAST TAKE OUT THE WORD BAD- NO I AM FOR THE OR TALK ABOUT CONTAINS A AND TO EVALUATE THAT RISK THAT SENSE IF IT REALLY HAS ANY VALUE OR NOT YEAH I THINK THAT THAT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE- SO WITH THAT- IS THERE CLARITY WITH THE AUTHOR. THE AND THE OTHER- PARTIES INVOLVED THAT THAT SENSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT IS ESSENTIAL BASED ON OUR- EXAMINATION IT'S NOT NECESSARY- BUT LEAVE IT FOR YOU TO RESOLVE THAT- AT. THE NEXT THE NEXT COMMITTEE LEVEL. ARE WE CLEAR WITHOUT. WELL LET'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT THE THIS YEAR I'M HERE KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN I BELIEVE AND I WERE. REALLY GOOD FAITH AND WE DID THIS AND WE GREEN PERSON TO THE LANGUAGE OF BEFORE US AND- I'M NOT PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE AN AWARDS RIGHT TODAY IN THE COMMITTEE AFTER AGREEMENT BUT I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE. CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS. BUT- YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS REALLY MADE TO MAKE SURE CONSUMER PROTECTION MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER REALIZES IN THE BOTTLE MAKE SURE THAT OUR FAMILY FARMERS ARE TAKING KERA. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE- WE OWE TO THEM BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE- WORK AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IN THAT IS FAIR AND JUST AND JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR- READING FROM SECTION DEEM ANY CONTAINER OF ALL OF WILL PRODUCE PROCESS SOLD OFFERED FOR SALE GIVEN AWAY OR POSSESSED IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH CONTAINS ALL WILL PRODUCE FROM ALL IS GROWN IN LOCATIONS OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA IN WHOLE OR IN PART. INCLUDES QUOTE THE WORD CALIFORNIA IN ANY FORM ON THE PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL SHALL STATE ON THE SAME PANEL THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF ALL OF WILL IN THE CONTAINER PRODUCE FROM ALL IS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA. IN A FONT SIZE THAT IS NO LESS THAN THE LARGEST FONT USED TO PRINT. QUOTE CALIFORNIA ON THE SAME PANEL. I THINK THAT GIVES. ABSOLUTE DISCLOSURE SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU- AT THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF THIS BILL TO RESOLVE- THAT ADDITIONAL SENSE WHETHER IT'S SUPERFLUOUS- OR NOT- I DO WANT TO GIVE. A LOT OF CREDIT- TO THE AUTHOR AND HER AND HER TEAM UP FOR WORKING WITH- COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND MY OFFICE AS WELL AS I- THE ADVOCATES THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM EARLIER THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIONS EVENTUALLY THERE WAS A- A COMPROMISE BILL THAT I THINK ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO ALLOW FOR. CALIFORNIA TO BE BETTER PROTECTED AS POTENTIAL BRAND BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT CONSUMERS. ARE WELL CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING. A MINIMUM CONTENT OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF THE WORLD IN A GIVEN BOTTLE WHEN THEY'RE PURCHASING THAT ITEM SO- I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A- A MOTION- WELL THERE WAS ONE MADE EARLIER BUT I THINK WE HAVE SINCE REVISED POLITICAL MOTIONS. TRANSPORTATION THIS YEAR I'M VERY RESPECTFUL OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAD WITH THE AUTHOR AND I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT AGREEMENT OKAY. BUT THE WORDS THAT YOU READ WITH THOSE RESERVE THOSE WITH THE IF THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT. YES OKAY- SO NOT GOING 2% OF THE DIRECTOR SENATE THEY WERE ARGUING ABOUT WAS THAT PART OF YOUR AGREEMENT WITH YASSER. MY RECOLLECTION WAS THAT THAT WAS CLARIFYING LANGUAGE FROM LEDGE COUNCIL REGIONAL CAN YOU CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT- THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT TO SPECIFY THE PERCENTAGE AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF US ON THE FRONT OF THE LABEL. THE WORDING THAT WAS USED WAS DONE WITH MYSELF AND WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT CONTAINED. THAT WAS NOT AN AGREED UPON WORD BUT A BIT THANK PERCENT OLIVE OIL WAS PART OF THE AGREEMENT SO THE WORKCONTAINED IS SOMETHING THAT WAS PUT IN. BY COUNSEL MYSELF THAT IF IT'S TO WORRY HE COULD PROBABLY REMOVE IT STILL HAVE THE SAME- THE SAME. JUST OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. OKAY ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER FINAL. OF FROM THE DAY. OF YEAH I MOVE THAT WE- WE- SUPPORT. THIS LANGUAGE- AND TAKE OUT THAT ONE SENTENCE THAT STARTS ON NINE TWENTY ONE TWENTY FIVE. AND ENDS ON THE LINE TWENTY EIGHT AND THAT WE MAKE THAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE NEXT MEETING. ALL RIGHT OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS ARTICULATED- WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH. ARKANSAS WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

I UNDERSTAND- I UNDERSTAND THERE THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ON THE DEFINITION OF LANDOWNERS TO LIMIT THE ASSISTANCE TO NON. CORPORATE INDEPENDENT LANDOWNERS I SHARE THE CONCERNS AND I AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT ADDED THESE AMENDMENTS TO BE INCLUSIVE.

SO WHERE ARE WE NOW WELL WATER SCARCITY A CHANGING CLIMATE NEW REGULATIONS IN A GROWING POPULATION ARE JUST SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING FARMERS AND FARMLAND. IN CALIFORNIA NAFTA'S WORK IN THE FAMILY CAN VALLEY IT'S AND WE FOUND THAT HIGH QUALITY FARMLAND MORE PRODUCTIVE VERSATILE AND RESILIENT BUT THE RELIABLE WATER SOURCE VERY LIMITED. WITH ONLY 9% OF THE WORK WITH ROUGHLY SIX MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED FARMLAND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BEING OF HIGH QUALITY AND EXPERIENCING LOW WATER STRESS. AND ACCORDING TO THE STATE- DRAFT GROUNDWATER REPORT STATEWIDE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF TWO MILLION TO TWO AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET PER YEAR- BY THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA SOME INDICATIONS ARE NEARLY. THAT NEARLY 40% OF THE CURRENT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CROPLAND OR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND MAY NEED TO BE VALID OR RETIRED TO BRING THE GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS AND ABOUT. THE SHIFT WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMIC COST OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS PER. YEAR THREE PP I THINK. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE BE THAT THE COST. WITH THE GT SUSTAINED GROUNDWATER. BUT THE LONG TERM AND IMPACT TO BE. CONSIDERABLY GREATER IF GROUNDWATER USE IS NOT MANAGE A FAMOUSLY AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NOT MADE AVAILABLE FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING. ACROSS THE STATE FARMERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH DEVELOP NON FARM CONSERVATION PLANS AND REACHING THE WATER USE REDUCTION GOAL BUT THE ACT. WE RECOGNIZE IN MANY CASES SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS MAY REQUIRE INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

TO ESTABLISH THREE FARM TO SCHOOL FOOD HUBS IN NORTHERN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOOD HUBS OFFER A REGIONAL ALLIES APPROACH TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL A SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR PROMOTING DIRECT FARM AND RANCH SALES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED AND UNPREDICTABILITY AND LOSS OF MARKETS. AND THAT'S HAVE A DISPOPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S SMALL SCALE FARMERS PARTICULARLY HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS OF COLOR- JUST IN REFORM INCREASINGLY CALLS FOR MORE REGIONAL ALLIES FOOD SYSTEMS WHICH IN TURN PROVIDE GREATER RESILIENCE IN TERMS OF NATURAL OR PUBLIC. HEALTH DISASTER IN TIMES OF NATURAL OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER. DURING THE PANDEMIC THOSE AREAS THAT HAD COMMUNITY FACING FOOD HUBS WERE ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY TOWARDS RE DIRECTING THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS TO AREAS OF NEED. AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS MODEL IS. AN ENTITY CALLED THE COMMON MARKET WHICH IS A NON IS A NON PROFIT FOOD HAVE OPERATING IN PHILADELPHIA NEW YORK GEORGIA AND TEXAS. AND WHICH PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR LOCAL FARMERS AND EMERGENCY FOOD RELIEF DURING THE PANDEMIC. MARKELLE LEADS THE NATION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WITH THE FARM ECONOMY VALUED AT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS.

PER YEAR THEY'RE NOW DIRECTING AN AVERAGE OF 16% OF THAT TO THEIR LOCAL FOOD ECONOMIES SUPPORTING HUNDRED THE CALIFORNIA LIVELIHOOD. BUT THEY'D LIKE TO AND CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. ESPECIALLY TO SUPPORT THE SMALLER FARMERS BETTER 80% CALIFORNIA'S FARMING POPULATION BUT TO DO THAT THEY DO NEED WHAT AB TEN OH NINE MAKES POSSIBLE. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH AND WORKING WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FUNCTIONS COULD HELP SERVE IN CREATING A MORE DIRECT LINK IN THE LOCAL SUPPLY CHAIN. ARE THAT CRUCIAL MISSING PIECES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN MENTIONED AND HELPING LOCAL FARMERS REACH THE MARKET. A LARGE INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FOOD HAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS YOU MENTIONED MOSTLY IN THE NORTHEAST MIDWEST AND THE GREAT LAKES AEAS.

CABALLERO HI EGGMAN HI WHEN AYE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE ALL RIGHT PUT THIS BILL ON CALL. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR SOME REMEMBER MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE E. B. TWELVE EIGHTY TWO FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU I'M NOT MOVING THE STRUCTURE- AND- MEMBERS- FIRST LET ME THANKS COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND FOR REFERENCING IN THE ANNOUNCES THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING ON WITH STAKEHOLDERS. WE'VE MADE MANY GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS RESOLVING THE MANY ISSUES AND- THIS BILL WHICH IS AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WITH THEIR HELP AND FULLY EXPECT TO RESOLVE THEM BEFORE THIS BILL REACHES THE FLOOR. AND NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL. MY STAFF BUT JUST RECEIVED A PROPOSED AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THIS MORNING. AND SO I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT. CLOSELY MYSELF BUT CERTAINLY DISCUSS ITS IMPLICATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND IT DOES THE PARK AN IMPORTANT WAY FROM THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED. AND THAT WAS INCLUDED IN SOME MARKUP. AMENABLE TO A SIMPLER APPROACH THAT DOES NOT LOOK BACK AT PRIOR YEARS BUT INSTEAD. COMPARES BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT WOULD SET THE TRIGGER. BASED ON FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF COMMUNITY SOURCES. PRODUCING AS MUCH. OR MORE THAN. THE CLOTHES COLONY SOURCES. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING AN AMENDMENT RIGHT NOW THAT WE MAY WANT TO TWEAK IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND SO MY PREFERENCE. WOULD BE TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE YOUR CONSULTANT IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH B. AND P. AND LAND A FULL AND FINAL SET OF AMENDMENTS. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS CONSISTENT WITH THE MOCK UP. AND ONGOING DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THE CEMA. ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA PET BLOG MATH BLOOD BANK. FORGET THE STRAIGHT. OF ONLY BEEN HANDLING THIS BILL FOR THREE YEARS THE CALIFORNIA PET BLOOD BANK MODERNIZATION ACT SEEKS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD FOR VETERINARY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND PHASE OUT THE OBSOLETE AND INHUMANE PRACTICE OF CAPTIVE CLOSED COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. BY AUTHORIZING LICENSED VETERINARIANS TO OPERATE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS TO PRODUCE AND SELL ANIMAL BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. THESE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS FOR ANIMALS ARE SIMILAR TO HUMAN MODELS IN THAT THEY COLLECT BLOOD FOR PETS WHOSE OWNERS VOLUNTARILY CONSENT TO THE DONATION. CURRENTLY THIS VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH ISN'T ALLOWED HERE INSTEAD CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REQUIRES ANIMAL BLOOD TO COME FROM SO CALLED CLOSE COLONIES. THAT KEEP HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS IN CONFINEMENT FOR YEARS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HARVESTING THEIR BLOOD. MEANWHILE DEMAND FOR ANIMAL OF BLOOD VASTLY OUTSTRIPS THE CLOSE QUALITY SUPPLY AND VETERINARIANS ARE REGULAR VETERINARIANS ARE REGULARLY FACED WITH A LACK OF LIFESAVING PRODUCTS TO PERFORM. TRANSFUSIONS AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO PROVIDES A HUMANE SOLUTION FOR SOURCING ANIMAL BLOOD WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY SHORTAGE AND ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS TO EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT CAPTIVE CLOSE COLONY K. NINE BLOOD BANKS. MY STAFF AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE C. VMA AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE TRIGGER AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER FOR THE PHASE OUT OF THE CLOSE CALL IN THE MODEL TO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRACTICES. AND MAKE CRITICAL BLOOD PRODUCTS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE OKAY AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO ADDRESSES THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN OF SB TWO OH TWO. AT THAT TIME A BY PROVIDING A TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE USE OF CAPTIVE CLOSE COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. ONLY PHASING THEM OUT ONCE THE AMOUNT OF DOG BLOOD COMMUNITY BANKS CELLS WERE EQUALS. OR EXCEEDS SELL EITHER EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT THE CLOSE CALL ON THE CELL FOR A PERIOD OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS. WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO REACHING AGREEMENT ON THESE PROVISIONS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SENATOR WELL CAN I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PASSIONATELY NOW FOR THREE YEARS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT VETERINARIANS ANIMAL WELFARE INTERESTS AND THE AFFECTED STATE DEPARTMENTS CAN ALL AGREE WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO ETHICALLY SOURCED SAFE. AND EXPANDED ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY. CALLING IN TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE DOCTOR CAN PULASKI CLINICAL DIRECTOR AT INSIGHT VETERINARY WELLNESS CENTER IN EL DORADO HILLS AND I BELIEVE HERE WITH US IS DR JEANINE BERGER. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESCUE AND WELFARE AT THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE VETERINARIANS INCLUDING A FULL TIME FORTY CRITICAL. PART TIME INTERNET AND CONTRACTED CARDIOLOGISTS YOUR- PRIOR TO OPENING OUR NEW HOSPITAL LAST YEAR WE ON TO BAND FIELD HOSPITAL. OKAY TIME GENERAL PRACTICE. IN THOSE HOSPITALS ARE NEED FOR BLOOD WAS FAIRLY RARE AND IF WE DIDN'T NEED IT WE COULD USUALLY COLLECTED FROM ONE OF OUR STAFF THAT. WORK IS MORE CRITICAL YOU'RE REFERRING TO AN AMERICAN. NOW IT'S AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL AND THE WHOLE NEW BALLGAME. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN WE WILL NEED BLOOD OR BLOOD PRODUCTS. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE PETS IN NEED OFTEN REQUIRING MULTIPLE UNITS. YEAH ONE MASS REMOVAL SURGERY RECENTLY THAT ENDED UP NEEDING FOR YOU KNOW ALL BLOOD ACT RBC. OR YOU KNOW THE FIVE. AFTER USING IN HOUSE FILED BY THE UNITED BLOOD COLLECTED FROM THE TECHNICIANS DOG WE BORROWED ONE THOUSAND UP FROM THREE OTHER EMERGENCY HOSPITAL INCLUDING ONE IN FAIRFIELD. EFFECTIVELY WIPING OUT THE BLOOD SUPPLY AND GREATER SACRAMENTO WHERE. THIS FORCES US TO MAKE HARD CHOICES BETWEEN WHICH PATIENTS WILL LOSE P. BLOOD CLOT. THERE SIMPLY IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BLOOD TO THE PATIENTS WHO NEED. WELL I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FOR DOG CAN FIND THE TO CLOSE POLICY BLOOD THING BUT BIGGER CONCERNS RELATED THE AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR PATIENTS. THESE TWO COMPANIES SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF CRITICALLY ILL AND INJURED SEVEN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD BANK. DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE BLOOD AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS. IN ADDITION IT WILL ALLOW US TO IMPORT THESE PRODUCTS FROM OUT OF STATE AS LONG AS THEY MEET OUR- THANK YOU NEED TO BE ASSURED THAT BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS.
