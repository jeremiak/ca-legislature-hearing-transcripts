THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION RECOVERY LEGISLATION TIMBER HARVEST PLAN EXEMPTION UNDER. AS SET FORTH IN SENATE BILL. NINE OH ONE AND WELCOME FISH AND WILDLIFE [inaudible] DEPARTMENT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. ITEM FIFTEEN RELATES TO A SPECIFIC BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FROM OUR DEPARTMENT. WHICH I BELIEVE YOU LAST DISCUSSED BACK IN MARCH PERHAPS EARLY APRIL. IT WAS HELD OPEN AT THAT TIME. HERE ARE THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS. OUR DEPARTMENT PROPOSES FIFTEEN POSITIONS [inaudible] AND A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOR SKEW YOUR NINETEEN TWENTY OF WHICH ONE MILLION. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND IS GENERAL FUND AND TWO MILLION IS. TIMBER REGULATION IS FROM THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FAR AS RE. HER IS RESTORATION FUND EXCUSE ME. THOSE FIFTEEN POSITIONS. ELEVEN ARE RELATED TO THE TIMBER FUND AND FOR OUR THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND. WHEN WE ENGAGED ON THIS TOPIC LAST TIME I TOLD YOU THAT IN MY VIEW THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WAS FOR A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE? POST CATASTROPHIC. FOR ARE THE LEGISLATURE -- PASSED SENATE BILL NINE A ONE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT BILL AND IS NOW A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH CATASTROPHIC FIRE. WITHIN THAT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OUR TASKS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. OUR DEPARTMENT SERVES IN AN ADVISORY ROLE TO CAL FIRE AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. DEALING WITH THE PROPOSED INCREASE USE OF NOTICE EXEMPTIONS. I MANAGE THE CATASTROPHIC FIRE RISK. THAT COULD PROVOKE ADDITIONAL WORK FOR OUR DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS ADVISING ON MANAGING TEMPORARY ROADS OR STREAM CROSSINGS. HELPING CAL FIRE HOST ACTIVITIES IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND REPORTING OF THOSE INSPECTIONS. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. ARE SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE LEAN HEAVILY ON OUR DEPARTMENTS DIRECT ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR AGENCY. OR POST PROJECT MONITORING AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION. SENATE BILL NINE A ONE INCREASES OUR WORKLOAD IT CAME WITH NO FUNDING. SINCE THIS BUDGET CHANGED. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU HAVE AN ANTICIPATION THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY MORE OF THESE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS. FASTRACK VENDORS NINE A ONE COMING FORWARD AND THE DESIRE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND GUARD AGAINST. SEGREGATION TO THE TO THE AT THE HABITAT BUT ALSO GET THE WORK THE DESIRED WORK DONE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIMBER. THAT'S A TWENTY AIMS TO TWENTY M. GO FAST AND DO MORE -- THE THING IS THIS IS THIS GOING TO DO IT. GIVEN THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OR THE ANTICIPATION THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT THE TIMBER HARVESTS PLAN CITY COULD BE -- FILE OR IS IT GOING TO BE A DELAY I GUESS THAT'S THE CONCERN. YES IT WILL HELP US DO IT BECAUSE IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS BUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL WE WILL HAVE NO ADDITIONAL. THIS PROPOSAL ADDS FIFTEEN STAFF. IT WE CAN PUT SPECIFICALLY ONTO THE ASSIGNMENT. OF ACHIEVING BOTH OF THOSE OBJECTIVES FIRST. GETTING THE WORK DONE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO REDUCE OUR FIRE RISK SECOND. DOING IT IN A MANNER THAT'S MOST PROTECTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. CALIFORNIA SHOWS IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR PROPOSITION. THE OPERATIVE WORD IS A IN. YOU CAN REDUCE THE FIRE RISK AND DO RIGHT BY OUR BY MIDDLE CONCERNED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS US THE STAFF TO INVEST DIRECTLY INTO THAT DIALOGUE WITH HOW FAR. AND HOW IS IT GONE WITH. SLAVE KAISER HAPPENED TIMBER HARVEST LANCERS BEEN THAT YOU'VE WORKED WITH THE A CAL FIRE IN THE DIFFERENT AFFECTED AREAS AREAS HOW HAS THAT -- COORDINATION WITH THIS ESTATE AGENCIES GONE BETTER. CERTAINLY IN MY TENURE IT'S HAD ITS UPS AND DOWNS. BUT IN MY PERSPECTIVE AFTER ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT WAS DEBATED WHEN WE LAST MET AND MARCH. OUR AGENCIES ARE CO LOCATED. OUR CO ASSIGNED TO A COMMON PURPOSE. AND WHILE THE DATA CAN REFLECT DIFFERENT TRENDS I THINK OVERALL -- DATA COMING OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FOURTEEN NINETY TWO SHOWS. IN MANY REGARDS WERE FINDING PERMIT EFFICIENCIES. IS IT A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE DO BETTER ABSOLUTELY. BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK BACKWARDS OVER THE LAST SAY FIVE TO SIX YEARS YOU'LL FIND DATA THAT SHOWS. EFFICIENCY TREND LINESARE UP NOT CATEGORICALLY ACROSS THE BOARD DOWN. OKAY A SEMI WHERE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN A DO APPRECIATE AT THE DIRECTOR AND FOCUSING ON THAT I I JUST WANT TO HONE IN ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS AND I I APPRECIATE YOU GET THIS INFORMATION. TODAY SO -- JUST WANT TO BE ABLE. TO WALK THROUGH SOME ITEMS AND THEN. HOW IT RELATES TO OTHERS CALLED THE TIMBER TAX RIGHT SELF IMPOSED -- IN IN -- WALK THROUGH IT. I THINK THEY GET THE CONCERN THAT WAS ADVANCED LAST TIME AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU'VE ALSO BEEN FOCUSING ON IS. DONE. ONE OF THE INTENTIONS. OF ADVANCING THE TIMBER TAX. AT WHICH IS INDUSTRY IMPOSED IS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE REVIEW TIME. I'M IN SO -- I I THINK WHAT YOU'VE SEEN. IS IN YOUR WORKING THIS OUT STILL BUT AT THE A TRAIN POTENTIALLY OF OF AN INCREASE REVIEW TIME. I'M AND I JUST WANNA GET BETTER HANDLING ON THAT. IT SO I'M JUST GONNA WALK THROUGH AN INVESTOR DIRECTOR FOR SO IT WORKS FOR YOU JUST IF I'M CORRECT IN MY ASSUMPTIONS. STE. SO TYPICALLY WHAT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN USED FOR IS THAT GREEN TIMBER [inaudible] HISTORICALLY. INSTANCE FIRES HAVE COME IN. YOU ARE SEEN ENHANCE. OUR WORKLOAD. BASE OFF OF FIRES IN IN HARVESTING THOSE. FOR SENATE IMPACTED BY FIRE. SO THAT IS THAT CORRECT SO. THAT IS AT A DRIVING FORCE SOMEWHERE SEEN [inaudible] AN INMATE. ENHANCE TIME TO BE A REVIEW PLANS YOU CAN JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT. I MISS A COUPLE THINGS FIRST SENATOR FIRST. I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE STATE'S PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR TIMBER INDUSTRIES. BUT FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND OUR TIMBER PROGRAM THAT ARE. TO WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN IT ZERO STAFF. AND IT'S THAT COLLABORATION THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO REBUILD THE PROGRAM. BUT I WOULD SAY IN MY MIND FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THE WORK WE DO WONDER THAT. WELL PERHAPS RELATED IS SEPARATE FROM THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TODAY. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT FOURTEEN NINETY TWO FROM AN THE NEXT THING I'D SAY IS IT'S MORE THAN OUR DEPARTMENT IT'S STATE WATER BOARD IT'S CAL FIRE AND CAL FOR HAS NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN THE TO HEARINGS WE'VE HAD ON OUR DEPARTMENTS PROPOSAL. THESE METRIC. SINCE WE LAST MET I THINK I MENTIONED I WOULD DO THREE THINGS. AND I'M REMISS ON ONE OF THEM. pHARD TO HAVE THE AGENCIES REPORT. ON FOURTEEN NINETY TWO TO YOU BEFORE OUR NEXT ENGAGEMENT. AN AGENCY IS WORKING TO GET THAT RIGHT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD NEW LEADERSHIP COME AND WE HAVE NEW INFUSION OF ENERGY INTO THEIR TIMBER PROGRAM. AND I THINK THEY'RE TAKING A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE NEXT REPORT. THE SECOND THING I SAID I BELIEVE I WOULD TAKE CARE OF IS PROVIDING YOU ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS STATEMENT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS FINANCES SUGGESTED TO YOU A MOCK UP OF THE FUNDS STATEMENT OF THIS NUMBER. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE MY STAFF HAVE OFFERED YOUR OFFICE A SNAPSHOT. OF SOME OF THE METRICS FROM THE NOT YET RELEASED BUT UPCOMING RELEASE OF THE TIMBER REPORT. SO WHAT I SEE HERE A COUPLE THINGS. IN SOME OF THE FACTORS I'VE HAD EXPLAINED TO ME YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SHIFT FROM A FOCUS OF GREEN TIMBER AND GREEN TREE HARVESTING. TO MORE OF THE TREE MORTALITY WORK I THINK THAT'S AN UNDERLYING FACTOR WILL WE SEE IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS. COMPANIES SHIFTING OVER TO DEALING WITH TREE METALLIC. IN USING EXEMPTIONS. RATHER THAN PROCESSING AS MANY T. H. PLEASE. ANOTHER THING I'VE SEEN IS. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD NEW -- ANIMAL SPECIES LISTED UNDER RELEVANT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. AND I THINK THAT THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THE REVIEW PROCESS ON THE T. H. P. FRONT. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS CAL FIRES HAD SOME VACANCIES -- IN PARTICULAR IN THE SANTA ROSA AND READING OFFICE WHICH ARE KIND OF THE HUB. THE T. H. P. REVIEW -- ENTERPRISE THAT WE STOOD UP BETWEEN OUR AGENCIES. LET ME JUST CHECK MY LOOK. IN BEFORE YOU GO TOO FAR SO -- IN THAT WASN'T WHEN MY QUESTION SO IS THAT. JUST WANTED TO GET A CLEAR FIVE FROM EASTON OVER SO. THOSE VACANCIES AS CRITICAL VACANCIES ARE WITHIN ONE DEPARTMENT OR ARE WE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS I UNDERSTAND HE'S CAL FAR OKAY BUT I'M DESCRIBING A SERIES OF THINGS WHICH I THINK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. OUR WHAT IS UNDERLYING SOME OF THE TREND LINES YOU'RE POTENTIALLY HEARING OR SEEING WHICH IS AN REVIEW OF DHT. YEAH THE REVIEW TIME MIGHTBE CHANGING. OR THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT OF ACRES INVOLVED IN THE PLANS APPEARS TO BE DECREASING RIGHT. AND I THINK THERE ARE REASONS FOR THOSE TRENDS ONE REASON AS PEOPLE APPEAR TO BE. PURSUING LAST HARVEST UNDER THE T. H. P.. AND MORE ARE FOCUSED ON THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTIONS RELATED TO THE FARMERS. ANOTHER REASON FOR A POTENTIAL SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE REVIEW TIME. IS. THE ADDITIONAL LISTING OF SPECIES WHICH REQUIRES MORE CONSULTATION MORE PAPERWORK. AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY. A MOMENTARY LOSS IN CRITICAL STAFFING AT CAL FIRE IN THE CENTER ROSE IN REDDING OFFICE. BUT I ALSO THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT THE DATA AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT. AND YOU CAN FIND TREND LINES THAT ARE SHOWING POSITIVE IF YOU THINK JUST ABOUT OUR DEPARTMENTS. PROCESSING WE ACTUALLY THINK ARE LAKE INSTREAM BAT ALTERATION WORKLOAD. HAS INCREASED BUT THE PERMITTING TIMELINE TO DEAL WITH IT IS SHRINKING. SO MY MY VIEW IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA YOU CAN FIND SOME TREND LINES WHICH ARE. OF CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND I THINK YOU CAN FIND SOME TREND LINES THE SHOW THE FUNDING IS PRODUCING PERMIT EFFICIENT [inaudible] AGAIN JUST. I KNOW WHERE WE ARE ALL TRYING TO ABSORB THIS -- AT THIS POINT -- IN IN A LITTLE BIT OF A FIRE HOUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I AM READING CORRECTLY SO. ON THE TV FRONT. REVIEW TO PROVE 6% PURE CHEESE PEAS COVERING 32% CURE RATE. THE BIGGEST DRIVER FOR THAT IS. GOING THROUGH THE EXEMPTION PROCESS. YOU'RE NOT CHECK IN THAT JUST EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T MIND TO MEET. THE THAT THAT PROCESS I THE EXPEDITED SIDE [inaudible] SO. YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SNAPSHOT METRIC WHICH I GET YOU TO SAID REVIEW APPROVE 6% FEWER TICKETS PLEASE. WHY? YOU ARE T. H. BEES ARE BEING SUBMITTED. BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE PURSUING A FOCUS ON THE EXEMPTION WORK. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT DATA SAID THEN. IN WALKED ME THROUGH THEN BECAUSE THEN WE SEEN. I'M JUST DOING THE MATH HERE BUT I THINK I I'M MONTHS LONGER THOUGH TO BE A TO DO. THE TEACHER PEAS -- BUT THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS HOW MUCH MY PIECES AND AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE DO I GOTCHA I I'M LITERALLY JUST. SINCE IT IMPACTS OBVIOUSLY THE NORTH COAST AND MISTER DIRECTOR EVEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THIS WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR IS JUST TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IF WE'RE LOOKING IN A MONTH LONGER IN REGARD TO TEACH BEES. YOUR CHEESE REASON ACRES COMING THROUGH IS TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OR THREE EXAMPLES OF WHY THE REVIEW TIME APPEARS TO INCREASE OKAY BY THE FIRST. YOU DO A TYPICALLY YOU DO A PRE HARVEST INSPECTION. IT RAN LIKE CRAZY THE HEAD SERIES ABOUT A DISTRICT RIVER EVENTS DURING THIS TIME FRAME PEOPLE COULDN'T GET OUT SECOND. IN SOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO DO THE PRE HARVEST INSPECTION WHICH IS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM IS JUST NOT MY DEPARTMENT. NO. PREVENTED YOU FROM GETTING OUT EARLIER YOU HAD TO GET OUT LATER. THIRD AS I MENTIONED WE'VE HAD SOME ADDITIONAL SPECIES LISTINGS. WHICH THEMSELVES CAN CAUSE ANOTHER LAYER REVIEW TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING. YOUR PROCESSING WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES CONSISTENTLY. BUT THESE ARE FOURTEEN NINETY TWO ISSUES AND WHILE I REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MOST CURRENT POOR. IN MY PERSONAL VIEW THESE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEXT REPORT I CAN COMMIT [inaudible] TO COMING AND DISCUSSING THAT REPORT WHEN AGENCY RELEASES IT. I SEE ASEPARATION BETWEEN THESE QUESTIONS. ENDED LATE. AND SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE FUNDING. WHICH IS ASKING OUR DEPARTMENT GO DO NEW WORK AROUND CAT AS FAR AS TRAFFIC PIRATES. BROUGH THE EXEMPTIONS AND THAT'S ALL OUR PROPOSAL IS SEEKING IT WHAT I WAS TAKING A LEASE THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON BEING TO GET IT DONE AND WHAT. OUR UNDERSTANDING LEASE ARE MADE OUT TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THAT BECAUSE WHILE THEY MAY BE TWO SEPARATE FUND SOURCES AND INITIATIVES. IT ALL IS SOMEWHAT RELATED SO I THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION HERE TODAY -- THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO THE DIGITAL THIRTY DAYS IS WEATHER RELATED AND STAFFING. IN IN THAT SO EVERY SOARING IN THE REPORT YOU ANTICIPATE THE IS AS IT'S BEEN A GRADUAL TREND FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS A HUNDRED AND FORTY AS A BEEN A TWELVE MONTH -- OR IS THIS SOMETHING IN ALL OF THE TO THE CHAIR AND THIS LED TO BE RAGING DISS TO BUILD HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY SINCE. TAKING IN THE GAME IS COMING ON THE INDUSTRY SIDE OF JUST. WHERE WE'RE AT ON THAT BUT I I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU WANTED? TO COVER THAT MISTER DIRECTOR. AB ONE SECOND. LOOK I I DO THINK THAT THE THE T. H. P. REVIEW TIME. UNDER THE FOUR YEARS I THINK IT'S BEEN A FOURTEEN NINETY TWO HAS SHRUNK AND THEN GONE UP MOST RECENTLY IT'S PLATEAUED AND IT MAY ACTUALLY GO UP AGAIN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COP COMING REPORT. AND THAT'S OF CONCERN. WE SHOULD A PRETTY OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT. BUT I'M NOT THE CONTROLLER OF THE REPORT. AGENCY IS THE CONTROLLER OF THE REPORT. WE HAVE A PROPOSAL ABOUT SENATE BILL. NINE ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC FIREMEN. ANY ITEMS YOU'D LIKE TO BE A CONCERN. THANKS BRIAN CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES IN C. LIKE THE DIRECTOR SAID WE HAVE NEW LEADERSHIP FOR FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AT THE AGENCY AND THEY ARE REVIEWING THE REPORT RIGHT NOW AND THEY WILL BE. IN THERE DOING A DEEP DIVE INTO ACTUALLY EACH DEPARTMET HOW MUCH FUNDING EACH DEPARTMENT HAS WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR WITH AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND TRYING TO FIND EFFICIENCIES. SO UNDER THAT NEW LEADERSHIP THERE'S GOING TO BE. I WOULDN'T SAY MISSION BASED REVIEW BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHERE WE'RE REALLY TAKING DOWN AND TRYING TO FIND EFFICIENCIES AND MAK THIS IS. MAKE THIS IS A FASHION AS POSSIBLE. IN INTO WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A RECEIVE A COPY OF THAT REPORT. WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN -- I I WOULD SAY WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH. CONSIDER SOME OF THE SNAPSHOTS I THINK WE SHOULD. OUR STAFF SHARED WITH YOUR STAFF INCLUDE. THE LIKELY METRICS THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY SHIFT BACK TO A GREATER NUMBER OF T. H. HE'S. IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PERIOD WHICH MEANS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE AREA. OF LAND UNDER THE T. H. IS. THAT ALSO SAY. SOME REASONS POTENTIALLY FOR THE REVIEW TIME BUMPING UP. ALSO INCLUDE. SOME OF THE T. H. BEES WERE CONVERSION T. AGENCIES WHICH TEND TO BE PRETTY CONTROVERSY. THE REQUIREMENT BY MIDDLE IMPACT REPORT CERTIFIED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S INVOLVED. AND I THINK WE'VE HAD INSTANCES IN THIS LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE THE T. H. P. IS THAT ORIGINALLY FILED BY THE SUBMITTER. HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GO FOCUS ON THE DROUGHT MORTALITY EXEMPTIONS. AND THEN WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THE TIMBER PLAN THEY'VE GOT SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS BECAUSE TIME IS PAST WHAT WHAT I'LL SAY IS A AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTOR LOOK. NOT AT ALL TRYING. TO DO AND I GOT YOUR WHATSOEVER SIMPLY TRYING TO BE A FOLLOW UP ON AN ITEM THAT WE SAID WE WOULD. SO YOU ARE CORRECT IN THE PAGE AND A HALF OF A SNAPSHOT. WE HAVE TWO ITEMS WE HAVE. ITEMS IN. WE'RE UNABLE TO DO A DEEP DIVE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE ARE THE FORMER IMPORTANT FRONT OF US. NUMBER ONE THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT TRANSITION FROM GREEN TREE HARVESTING -- TO EXEMPTIONS AND THEN THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION -- POINTS IN REGARDS. TO IN INCREASE AGAIN NEEDING BEER HAVE A FULL REPORT TO BE A TO GIVE FULL CONTEXT. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE A TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE TODAY -- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SOME HEARING. AT THIS CASH AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY FORTY FIVE DAYS TO BE FAIR RIGHT. I'M RANGING THERE -- AND I I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GO OFF LINE ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE ESPECIALLY FOR LOOKING INTO AN ADDITIONAL MONTH. RIGHT INCREASE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE FACTORS ARE -- AND BE ABLE TO ASSIST AND BRING THAT DOWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TELLING US TO HAVE A COMMON. WHEN WE RESERVE AT RETAILERS ADELIA WHEN WE REVIEWED THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU BACK IN JANUARY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS? ON THE NINE A ONE SIDE ALRIGHT THIS IS ITEM ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. LET'S OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT -- WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEN SB NINE A ONE FORTY AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO OR WHATEVER. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- RICH CORDON THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY IS ASIAN. THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WAS ACTIVE IN. AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO BACK AGREED. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A TAX ON LUMBER. IN ORDER TO ADD TO S. SEE. AN INCREASE IN IN THE TIME FRAME THAT IT TAKES. PROCESSING REDUCING THE PROCESSING TIME FOR TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS. AB. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS FIRST ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL -- THE DIRECTOR IS ASKING FOR FUNDS. TO HIRE STAFF TO MONITOR EXEMPTIONS TO TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXEMPTIONS TO TIMBER HARVEST PLAN SHOULD BE MONITORED. I WE WANT THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WHETHER -- FIFTEEN POSITION IS CORRECT WE DON'T. KNOW. HIS JUDGMENT IN TANDEM A GUY WILL ACCEPT THAT. WHAT WE DO HAVE CONCERN ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY THE SOURCE OF THESE FUNDS COMING OUT OF THE TIMBER TAX? AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE REPORT. IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE WE HAD A REPORT OF FROM -- THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE ACTIVITY UNDER THE YET THE TIMBRE OF REGULATION AND FORCE RESTORATION PROGRAM. WITHOUT THAT REPORT AS WE ONLY HAVE ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THE GOALS ORIGINALLY IN. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THE FUND. IN OUR PROJECTIONS ARE THAT THE FUND IS HEADED TOWARDS A DEFICIT. IN A ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FROM THE FUND AT THIS POINT. COULD MAKE THAT DEFICIT. OCCUR FASTER. WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND SO THEY PROBABLY FUNDING TO TO PAY FOR THESE POSITIONS THIS YEAR. BUT WE ARE HEADING TO A POSITION WHERE THERE WILL BE SOME BRINKMANSHIP AROUND HOW WE MANAGE OUR TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS. THE OF EVALUATION AND MONITORING OF EXEMPTIONS. AND DO THAT IN A WAY THAT. HOLDS TRUE TO WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN PASSING AB. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MAKAYLA MAY HAVE A HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES WE DID -- BEFORE YOU A FULL TWO MONTHS AGO. RAISING THESE CONCERNS WE SHOT MY COMPANY MY CLAN EXCUSE ME SHARES THE CONCERNS THAT. MISTER GORDON -- INDICATED I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE TO YOU. AND BY NO MEANS IS THIS A CRITICISM OF THE CURRENT IT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION NOR. DFW BUT THERE MIGHT BE A RATIONALE FOR HOLDING UP THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT. ALTHOUGH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE OBVIOUSLY BY THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. BUT I DON'T THINK A NEW ADMINISTRATION AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STILL LACKING. AND THE ISSUE THAT WE WERE RAISED WITH YOU TWO MONTHS AGO NOW WAS IS HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO AN ADEQUATE REVIEW. AND MAKE A FIRM DETERMINATION WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS DATA. IN TWO PLUS YEARS AND WHETHER THERE'S UPS AND DOWNS IN REVIEW OR ANYTHING ELSE WE KNOW CLEARLY. THAT STAFF CONTINUES TO INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD. THE NUMBER OF T. H. P.'S GENERALLY ARE ON A DOWNWARD SLOPE AND YET REVIEWS ARE WELL ABOVE. WHAT THEY USED TO BE? AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON THIS BUDGET REQUEST WITHOUT A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT DATA THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK TO THE DAY S.. JUST SO EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE IN THE ISSUE BEFORE US. HERE'S ONE POINT FOUR EIGHT THREE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR. IN TWO MILLION IN THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FOREST. RESTORATION FUND IN [inaudible] TWENTY NINETEEN RIGHT. IT SEEMS TO BE THE SPLIT I'M. I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR RESOURCES REFER THE DEPARTMENT IS [inaudible] WE'VE GOT. WORK IT'S GOING TO BE DONE ON THE EXEMPTION THAT SEEMS TO BE POPULAR GIVEN SB NINE OWN NINE A ONE AND THEN THE REGULAR -- TIMBER HARVEST -- PLAN C. EXPEDITED TIMBER HARVEST PLANS TO RECORD A GOOD. ONE EDUCATE ME ON IF THIS IS THE RIGHT SPLIT THAT WERE USING. ARE WE USING MONEY FROM THIS. HARVEST FUN -- A TIMBER HARVEST FUND THAT'S BEEN ACCUMULATED TO TO PROCESS THE NORMAL TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THAT ARE GREEN. HARVESTING FIRST TO SEE EXEMPTION WHICH IS A REMEDIAL I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY REMOVAL OF DEAD. TREES I ASSUME THAT THAT STILL. MARKET APOLOGY. WHEN PEOPLE ARE CRITICAL WHEN BUT CAN YOU SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THAT TOUR WERE USING APPROPRIATE? BALANCE OF GENERAL FUND AND THE M.. RESTORATION FUNDS MONEY. I SEE MY COLLEAGUE OF FINANCE RAISING HIS HAND. A THIRD DRIVER PART OF MY ANTARCTICA OF FIRST STARTED IT SO WONDERING THE PROPOSAL WE ANALYZED -- WHAT OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE A A BEFOREHAND YOU STATUE WAS IDENTIFIED WHAT THE APPROPRIATE USE OF THE FUNDS ARE -- AND SO THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THAT WE USE THE GENERAL FUND FOR WE MADE SURE TO TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT LANGUAGE WHICH IDENTIFIES. THE USE OF THE TEMPERATURE. TO SOMEONE BASED ON THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT. THE MAJORITY HAS TWO MILLION. TO ONE POINT FOUR EIGHT THREE SO SOMEBODY DID IT BREAK DOWN BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE REMOVAL OF PRODUCT. WOULD BE. IN LINE WITH THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT WOULD BE A BENEFICIAL USE UNDER TIM TIMBER HARVEST PLAN. AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER BALANCE WOULD BE OTHER CONCERNS FOR MITIGATION FIRE. PROTECTION PREVENTION YEAH THE DATA. DIRECTOR HERE'S HOW I WOULD% ANSWER JUST SPEAKING PERSONALLY. THE PROPOSAL RELIES ON TO FUNDS SOURCES. IN MY JUDGMENT EACH FUND SOURCES APPROPRIATE. YOU ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE RATIO. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. I'D ALSO SAY THE POSITIONS ARE A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN POSITIONS THEMSELVES LET. ELEVEN ARE ON THE TIMBER FUND FOR ON GENERAL FUND [inaudible] THAT. I THINK REASSURES ARE FAIR QUESTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN OFTEN DISCUSSED DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU. WHY ARE YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION LEAVE MY LAST COMMENT I I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES THIS RIGHT? ONE WE ARE DELAYED IN SEEN THE REPORT -- BUT THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS IN FRONT OF US ASKING FOR THE MAJORITY THESE POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO COME FROM THE TEMPLE FUND. AND WE'RE SEEING A SNAPSHOT AT SNAPSHOT SHOWS ABOUT A MONTH INCREASE. IN THE APPROVAL OF TIMBER HARVESTING. SO WE HAVE A SELF IMPOSED TIMBER TAX. ONE OF THE GOALS NOT THE ONLY ONE ONE OF THE GOALS WAS A DRIVE THAT. THE TIMELINE FOR APPROVAL TEACH BEES. SO NUMBER. ONE WE ARE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IN ARREARS IN REGARDS TO THE REPORT. NUMBER TWO THE MAJORITY THAT THE POSITIONS ARE BEING CHARGED THE TIMBER FUND. AND THEN AT NUMBER. THREE I HAVE SOME CHALLENGES OF IS IT REALLY. THE RATIO IS THAT RIGHT RATIO BECAUSE NO ONE CAN SEE. SO I THINK WHAT WERE IN A POSITION HERE TODAY I HAVE. TRUST AND THEN WE HAVE TO VERIFY AFTER WE TAKE A VOTE. SHARE WITH YOU IT'S FRUSTRATING. I THAT WERE IN THE POSITION AND I WOULD SAY THAT MISTER CHAIR. IF THIS IS IN FRONT OF US NEXT YEAR -- IN WERE UNABLE DECIPHER I WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT. DOING IT FOR A SECOND. YEAR IN A ROW. SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT IN CASH WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN. DEFINITELY A TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THAT PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE BRINGING FOR AS FAR AS THE FOURTH. OKAY THERE WE HAVE IT IS OUR MOTION.
