00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.155
FOR SOME ADDITIONAL SETTLE UP

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:41.090
PAYMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.258
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT NOT

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:44.260
REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENTS

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:47.497
MOVING TO EARLY EDUCATION --

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.199
I THINK -- MISTER VISWANATHAN

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.400
ALREADY MENTIONED -- THE

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.068
EXPANSION OF OF PRESCHOOL TO

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.870
ALL LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:54.971
THE STATE OVER A THREE YEAR

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.506
PERIOD WE FIND THIS TO BE A

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.907
REASONABLE APPROACH AS THESE

00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.576
CHILDREN -- THE RESEARCHERS

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.543
FOUND THAT THESE CHILDREN

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.878
BENEFIT THE MOST IN THE LONG

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.379
TERM FROM THESE TYPES OF OF

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:06.249
PROGRAMS ON HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.484
SERVICES STARTING WITH CAL

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.453
WORKS THE -- ADMINISTRATION'S

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.588
APPROACH TO CAL WORKS IS A

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:12.455
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:13.723
WHAT THE IMMINENT AND AND THEN

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.225
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.693
LAST YEAR SPECIFICALLY THE

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.494
ADMINISTRATION SIMPLY PROVIDES

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:19.863
AN ACROSS THE BOARD GRANT

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:21.598
INCREASE THE CONSEQUENCES

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.266
THAT NOT ALL FAMILY SIZES

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.634
WOULD NECESSARILY BE AT FIFTY

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.102
PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.337
LEVEL WHICH IS THE TARGET THE

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.939
LEGISLATURE HAD SET LAST YEAR

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:31.274
ALSO WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.876
SERVICES ARM THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:35.044
BUDGET -- MAINTAINS THE SEVEN

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:36.779
PERCENT SERVICE REDUCTION

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:39.115
OF RESTORATION -- THAT WAS

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:41.084
COUPLED WITH THE MCO TAX BUT

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.518
THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT

00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:44.721
CONTINUE THE MCO TAX AS PART

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:47.724
OF ITS BUDGET PACKAGE LASTLY

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.259
ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:51.227
-- THE GOT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.595
PROPOSAL TO INSTITUTE AN

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.063
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.732
AND CUP AND COUPLE THAT WITH

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:56.900
ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES ON THE

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.534
HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE WORKS A

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.436
LITTLE BIT OF CROSS PURPOSES

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:01.938
IN PARTICULAR IF THE PENALTY

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.473
IS DESIGNED CORRECTLY REVENUE

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.408
SHOULD DECLINE OVER TIME AS

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.010
INDIVIDUALS MAINTAIN OR GAIN

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.778
COVERAGE THIS COULD CREATE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.113
SOME VOLATILITY IN THE AMOUNT

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:11.314
OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.549
SUBSIDIES FOR FOLKS PURCHASING

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:14.584
INSURANCE ON THE MARKET

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:15.852
OVER TIME SO THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:16.786
WILL JUST WANT TO CONSIDER

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:18.321
HOW TO ME KEEP THAT LEVEL

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:22.158
OF FUNDING STABLE OVER TIME

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.860
THE LAST POINT I'LL JUST REYES

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.561
IS ON THE REVENUE PROPOSAL

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.096
SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY THE

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.398
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:30.333
CONFORMITY POSITION UP PROP

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.869
UP EXCUSE ME PROPOSALS THE

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.504
GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO COUPLE

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.572
THESE -- TOGETHER TO REACH A

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:39.409
REVENUE REVENUE NEUTRAL PACKAGE

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:40.677
ACHIEVING THIS LIKELY WOULD BE

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:43.346
VERY DIFFICULT -- AT DEVELOPING

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:46.215
EIGHT CONFORMITY PACKAGE BASED

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.517
ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FEDERAL

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:50.420
CHANGES TO TAXES TO REACH

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.654
A PARTICULAR REVENUE TARGET

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.189
WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING AND

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.324
WE RECOMMEND SPLITTING THESE

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.525
PROPOSALS AND CONSIDERING

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:56.559
THEM SEPARATELY THEY BOTH

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.994
HAVE MERIT BUT WE BELIEVE THEY

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:00.897
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.265
TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE I'LL

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.533
JUST PROVIDE SOME HIGH LEVEL

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.801
COMMENTS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.136
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIRST THE

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.705
GOVERNOR IDENTIFIES A NUMBER

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.840
OF POLICY PRIORITIES EARLY

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.308
MANY OF THESE ARE OUTLINES

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.609
OF OBJECTIVES OF THE GOVERNOR

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.511
WOULD LIKE TO REACH THE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.080
ADVANTAGE FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.281
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TIME FOR

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.782
THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT ITS MARK

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.584
ON THESE POLICIES AND FORM AND

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.852
FORM THEM IN A WAY THAT ALIGNS

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.754
WITH ITS PRIORITIES MANY OF

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.189
THE PRIORITIES THE GOVERNOR

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.458
HAS HAS -- BROUGHT UP IN HIS

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.692
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALIGNED WITH

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.327
REACHED WITH RECENT LEGISLATIVE

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.030
ACTION THE SECOND COMMENT

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.298
ALL MAKE ON ON THE BUDGET

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.066
STRUCTURE IS ABOUT THE ONGOING

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.135
COSTS THE ONGOING COSTS IN THE

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.370
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ABOUT TWO

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:41.871
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.373
THE BUDGET YEAR GOING TO THREE

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.008
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.176
YEAR AFTER THAT SOME OF THESE

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.045
COSTS COULD GROW HOWEVER FOR

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.613
INSTANCE DISASTER COSTS WHICH

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.315
ARE LARGELY -- CONSIDER ONE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.616
TIME IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.318
HAVE IN RECENT YEARS PROVED

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.919
TO BE MORE OF AN ONGOING COSTS

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.087
SO THIS COULD INCREASE THE

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.822
OVERALL ONGOING COST IN THE

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:04.861
BUDGET -- AND MOREOVER -- THERE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.329
ARE GOING RESOURCES AVAILABLE

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:07.730
MAYBE SOMEWHAT CHANGING AND ALL

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.165
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND REVENUES

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.133
AT THE END OF MY COMMENTS

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:12.802
ON THE BUDGET STRUCTURE THE

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.570
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO --

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.039
DEDICATES A SMALLER PROPORTION

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.607
OF DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.208
TOWARDS RESERVES COMPARED TO

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:21.144
RECENT BUDGETS PART OF THAT

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.678
IS DUE TO A NEW INTERPRETATION

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:23.980
OF PROPOSITION TWO THAT

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.982
NECESSITATES A ONE POINT EIGHT

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.517
BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT INTO

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.118
THE BUDGET SUB STABILIZATION

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:32.321
ACCOUNT BUT THE OTHER ISSUE

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:33.990
THAT THIS BRINGS UP IS WHAT

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.425
ARE THE RESERVES BEING DESIGNED

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:36.759
FOR SO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.061
BUDGET THERE'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.595
BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:41.264
ESTIMATED TO BE AVAILABLE AT

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.599
THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY OUR

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.201
OFFICE HISTORICALLY CONSIDERS

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:46.669
THE SOME OUT TO BE THE AMOUNT

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:47.770
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN AN

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.505
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN TO COVER THE

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:52.075
COSTS OF ONGOING -- PROGRAMS

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.609
BUT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE ALSO

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.211
SEEN THAT THESE RESOURCES WILL

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.579
WILL ALSO BE CALLED UPON TO

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.082
RESPOND TO DISASTERS SO ONE

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.417
OF POINT WE WOULD -- UP DIRECT

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:02.518
THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSE TO

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:03.853
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH RESERVES

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.088
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BOTH

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.989
ADDRESS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.191
IN THE COSTS RELATED WITH

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:11.794
A DISASTER SIMULTANEOUSLY

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:12.962
WELL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.897
NOT DEDICATE AS MANY RESOURCES

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.265
TO DISCRETIONARY RESERVES IT

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:17.700
DOES AS I MENTIONED ALLOCATE

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:18.901
A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.136
OF RESOURCES TO PAYING DOWN

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.637
DEBT LIABILITIES WHICH DOES

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.573
IN THE LONG TERM REDUCE

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.608
-- -- THE ONGOING COSTS OF

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:26.843
THE BUDGET AND PUTS THE THE

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:31.481
BUDGET IN A BETTER CONDITION

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.049
WELL THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.350
ACCOUNT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.152
BALLOTS TO ADDRESS -- THE

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.687
NON SCHOOL SIDE OF THE BUDGET

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:38.988
THERE IS NO RESERVE AT THE

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.289
STATE LEVEL CURRENTLY FOR

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.625
SCHOOLS PROPOSITION TWO DID

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.227
CREATE A STATE LEVEL RESERVE

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.661
FOR SCHOOLS BUT THE FORMULAS

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:46.829
HAVE NOT YET REQUIRED THERE

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.164
TO BE A DEPOSIT INTO THAT

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:50.967
ACCOUNT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.802
SAVING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:53.936
IT IS STATE LEVEL THERE IS

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.438
NOT ANY DEDICATED RESERVES

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.273
FOR THEM IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.841
ANTICIPATED WANTING TO USE

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:01.344
FUNDING WITHIN ITS OTHER

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.412
WITH A RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:04.480
SCHOOLS IN THE EVENT OF A

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.848
DOWNTURN THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:06.916
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HAVING

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.284
A HIGHER OVERALL LEVEL OF

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.953
RESERVES MOREOVER WITHIN THE

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.655
PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEED

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.956
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ONE TIME

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.124
SPENDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.193
BUDGET THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.427
IS THAT THERE IF IS IF THERE

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.929
IS A YEAR TO YEAR DECREASE

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:20.963
IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.098
EIGHT GUARANTEED THERE COULD

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.399
BE IMPACTS TO THE ONGOING

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.769
PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS MY LAST

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:27.837
COMMENT WILL JUST WILL BE

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.939
ABOUT THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THE

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.240
GOVERNOR'S REVENUE ESTIMATES

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.042
ARE VERY CLOSE TO OURS VERY

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.511
VERY CLOSE TO OURS AND THAT

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.346
SAID BOTH OF OUR REVENUE

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.548
ESTIMATES WERE PUT TOGETHER

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:39.882
BEFORE THE DOWNTURN IN THE

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.217
MARKET AT THE END OF TWENTY

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.920
EIGHTEEN SO THERE IS REST

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.788
RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL MARKET

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:47.557
WE ALSO ARE SEEING WEAKNESS

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.925
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER PAYMENTS

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.859
WHICH ARE PAYMENTS BY HIGH

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.361
INCOME EARNERS ON THAT CAME IN

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:53.529
THIS JANUARY WE HAVE A COUPLE

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:55.264
MORE DAYS BUT WE'VE REALLY

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:59.435
SPROUT THE TAIL -- UNDER OUR

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.104
REVENUE ESTIMATES THIS AFFECT

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.273
OF THE LOWER MARKET -- AND THE

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.876
WEEK OF JANUARY WOULD LIKELY

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.678
ONLY REALLY BRING DOWN THE

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.479
ONE TIME AVAILABLE RESOURCES

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.448
IN THE BUDGET THIS IS BECAUSE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.016
UNDER OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.419
WE ASSUMED VÀ SLOW GROWTH IN

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.387
THE STOCK MARKET CONSEQUENTLY

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.022
THERE ISN'T A LARGE ON GOING

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.724
AFFECT OF THIS LOWER LEVEL ON

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.426
THE MARKET THERE IS SOME AFFECT

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.594
A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.230
A YEAR BUT NOT IT'S NOT TWO

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:28.931
BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.066
THE SIZE OF THE WHAT WE'RE

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.300
STATES CURRENTLY SEEING IN THE

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.803
SHORTFALL IN THE REVENUES IF

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:35.071
YOU THINK UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:38.841
FRAMEWORK -- THE ONGOING

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.276
AVAILABLE RESOURCES ACTUALLY

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:42.011
ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.379
THEY HAD LOWER PROGRAMMATIC

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.847
SPENDING THAN WE DID DUE TO

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.449
BIRTH REDUCTIONS IN THEIR

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.684
MEDI CAL COSTS SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.086
THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:52.588
REASONABLE FOR ONGOING SPENDING

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.857
IN THE BUDGET YEAR THERE ARE

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.425
REVENUE ESTIMATES IT'S LIKELY

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.294
SOMEWHERE BELOW THREE BILLION

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.829
DOLLARS AND OUR PROGRAMMATIC

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.397
SPENDING ASSUMPTIONS UNDER

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.999
THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES THREE

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.567
BILLION DOLLARS LIKELY STILL IS

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:05.968
REASONABLE USING ALL OF THEIR

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:07.470
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PROGRAMMATIC

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.305
COSTS THAT SAID THIS IS

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.973
ALL HIGHLY ON CERTAIN THE

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.608
ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS COULD

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.343
CHANGE OVER TIME AND WE'LL

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.980
WE'LL KNOW A LOT MORE IN MAY

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.315
SIX TWO COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.117

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.452
FOURTH QUARTER SHORTFALL THAT

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:25.621
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:29.225
ABOUT -- TWO BILLION TWO POINT

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.926
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE DON'T

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:33.229
YET HAVE THE FINAL NUMBERS FOR

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.797
RE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING CLAIMED

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.032
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH BUT

IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IT'S

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.534
IT'S HOVERING AROUND TWO POINT

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.669
FOUR TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.638

TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:11.334
OF RESERVES DURING A POTENTIAL

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.469

ISSUE THAT WE HAD CHAMPIONED

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.218
IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.619

TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BEING THAT

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:16.132
WAS A VERY PROMINENT IN OUR

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.533
ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL AT THE END

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.837
OF LAST YEAR THAT AND LASTLY --

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.506
OUR EARLY EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:26.208

MUCH OF OUR THINKING IN THE

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:35.251
EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSAL ON

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.318
HAVING SAID THAT I KNOW THAT

WE'RE ALL CONCERNED THAT

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.188
WITH THE RECESSION LOOMING

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:41.757
HOW THIS REALLY IMPACTS ARE

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.359
FEELING ABOUT ONE TIME VERSUS

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.327
ONGOING SPENDING -- WE THINK

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.395
THAT THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.564
POINT IS FOR A RESPONSIBLE

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.999
BUT OBVIOUSLY GIVEN MISSED HIS

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:51.367
COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE REVENUE

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.602
ESTIMATES IN THE CONTINUING

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:54.970
SHORTFALL IN REVENUE ESTIMATES

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.605
WERE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO BE

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.974
WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY ON

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.043
IN MOST YOU KNOW JUST OF THE

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.178
FINAL POINT IS WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:04.180
SAY IS THAT WERE VERY EXCITED

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.247
ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:07.216
IN YEARS PAST -- THE JANUARY

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.918
PROPOSALS WERE FRANKLY FAIRLY

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.754
THIN AND -- DIDN'T HAVE AS

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.089
MUCH OGDEN ALLOW REALLY AS MUCH

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.892
-- ROBUST DISCUSSION FROM THE

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.695
FEBRUARY TO MAY PERIOD GIVEN

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.597
THAT MANY OF THE LARGER POLLS

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:23.065
ARE RELEASED NOW IN JANUARY

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.099
WE'RE EXCITED THAT EACH OF

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.067
THE SUBCOMMITTEES WILL HAVE A

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:26.969
CHANCE TO REALLY FEDERAL DONE

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.537
ON MANY OF THESE VERY LARGE

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.906
VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY ALSO

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.174
WITHOUT GOING TO TURN OVER TO

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.810
MR OBERNOLTE FOR ANY COMMENTS

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.111
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:37.146
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'M GONNA

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:38.981
START WITH THE LA -- -- YOU'D

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.249
MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.384
THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.753
THE PRE FUNDING TOWARDS THE

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:47.523
CAL STIRS UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:50.059
WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.260
GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PUT

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.828
TOWARDS CALPERS UNFUNDED

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.163
LIABILITY SO IT'S THREE THREE

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.331
BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALPERS

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:57.066
UNFUNDED LIABILITY A DIRECT

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.501
PAYMENT TO PAY DOWN THAT

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.003
LIABILITY BUT IN CAL STIRS IT'S

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:02.238
WORDED IN A WAY THAT ENABLES

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.572
THE DISTRICTS TO REDUCE THEIR

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.707
CONTRIBUTION RATES SO I WANNA

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.775
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND -- THAT

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.544
TWO POINT THREE BILLION WILL

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:11.447
THAT RESULT IN A REDUCTION AND

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:12.882
CAL STIRS UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.250
IF IT JUST IF THE DISTRICTS

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.051
JUST PAY LESS WITH THAT MONEY

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.854
OR -- THE RIGHT OR IS IT JUST

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.223
GOING TO BE A NET ZERO SO THE

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.993
SO THE THE GOVERNOR HAS TO CAL

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:26.428
STIRS PROPOSES THE TO PAY THE

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.098

01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:30.533
OF THE LIABILITY THERE SORT

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:33.002
OF TWO TRACKS ON THE DISTRICTS

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.303
SIDE OF THE LIABILITY OF THE

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:35.704
GOVERNOR PROPOSES PROVIDE TO

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.039
PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.141
DOLLARS TO CAL STIRS TO PAY

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.544
DOWN TO BASICALLY PAY SCHOOL

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.646
DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.281
BUDGET YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.616
THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.118
TO PROVIDE TWO POINT THREE

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:50.886
BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.389
THE OVERALL UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.823
ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SIDE OF

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.693
THE LEDGER OKAY I UNDERSTAND

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.795
SO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:00.896

TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.202
OR OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.370
IT'S FISCALLY PRUDENT WHAT

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:09.738
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.040

OVERALL FUNDING IS RELATIVELY

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:28.390
HIGH MEANS THAT THAT THAT

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.725
FUNDING MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.994
IN A YEAR -- WHEN THEY'RE WHEN

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.395
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS

DECLINING YEAR OVER YEAR AND

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:35.764
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.232
CONSIDER HOLDING THAT MONEY

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.767
IN RESERVE TO PROVIDE THAT

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:39.902
KIND OF RELIEF TO DISTRICTS

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.937
IN A YEAR OP WHEN REVENUE IS

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:44.239
DECLINING THANK YOU I'M FOR

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:46.408
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:48.944
THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.113
NOTICES INTENT TO RAISE TAXES

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:51.914
ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:54.016
AREAS THERE'S A PROPOSED TAX

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.718
ON TELEPHONE SERVICE TO FUND

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:58.220
THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.489
THERE IS A PROPOSED TAX ON

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.757
DRINKING WATER AND FERTILIZER

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:02.992
AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THE

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:04.193
LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERED IN

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:07.496
PREVIOUS YEARS TO FUND -- CLEAN

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.465
DRINKING WATER IN COMMUNITIES

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.399
THAT DON'T YET HAVE IT AND

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:11.634
I THINK WE ARE ALL UNITED

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.735
IN OUR BELIEF THAT THOSE ARE

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.870
WORTHWHILE CAUSES BUT -- I'M

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.106
CONCERNED ABOUT WHY FIRST OF

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.207
ALL WE'RE NOT JUST FUNDING

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.575
THOSE THINGS OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.310
FUND GIVEN THAT THEY SEEM TO BE

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:22.978
ONE TIME CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.314
AND NOT ONGOING EXPENSES AND

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.849
SECOND OF ALL I'M CONCERNED

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.283
ABOUT THE PERCEPTION OF US

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.719
RAISING TAXES ON CALIFORNIANS

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.287
IN A YEAR WHEN THE STATE HAS

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.689
A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.391
SURPLUS JOE COULD YOU ADDRESS

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.359
WHY WE'RE TAKING THAT APPROACH

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.261
SURE SO FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.230
THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:43.465
-- GOVERNOR PROPOSES RAISING

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.833
AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.402
TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BUT THE

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.970
ACTUAL DETAILS OF THAT WE KNOW

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.171
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WORK

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.439
OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.274
THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS I THINK

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.942
THE SECOND THING AS THE LA --

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:56.111
MENTIONED BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.846
BIG SURPLUS BUT SO LITTLE OF

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.349
IT IS ONE TIME AND THESE ARE

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.084
SUCH IMPORTANT PRIORITIES AND

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.318
MAKING SURE OUR DRINKING WATER

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:04.753
IS SAFE FOR MAKING SURE THAT

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.455
OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:08.123
IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE -- THAT'S

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.358
NOT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.459
BELIEVES CAN BE FIXED IN A

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:12.361
YEAR OR TWO OR EVEN THREE YEARS

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:13.462
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.830
THERE IS AN ONGOING FUNDING

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.066
SOURCE FOR THAT -- SO WHEN IT

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.767
COMES TO THE ACTUAL ACTIONS

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.169
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DISCUSSED

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:21.637
EARLIER TODAY WE VIEWED AS

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:22.838
VERY MUCH EMERGENCY ACTIONS

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:23.772
THAT WE WANT TO TAKE RIGHT

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.974
NOW -- BUT GOING FORWARD WE

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.043
THOUGHT THAT IF THESE PROGRAMS

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.545
IN OUR BUDGET WERE A FUNCTION

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.046
OF THE GENERAL FUND AND IF THE

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.414
GENERAL FUND WERE TO DROP IN

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:33.782
A SIGNIFICANT WAY AND LA --

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:34.917
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.351
BIKE'S UNDER THE RECESSION

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:38.020
SCENARIO THAT OUR DEPARTMENT

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.588
HAS MODELED REVENUES COULD

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.657
DROP BY TWENTY FIVE BILLION

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.292
DOLLARS IN A SINGLE YEAR AND

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:44.760
NEARLY SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.495
OVER THREE YEARS SENSITIVE

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.597
CUTS ACROSS A RANGE OF PROGRAMS

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.665
-- AND THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.600
SEEN AS DISCRETIONARY SUCH AS

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.368
THESE PROGRAMS OFTEN WILL GET

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.104
THE AX WHEN AS YOU CAN JUST

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.171
MATCHING WE ALL AGREE THERE

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.439
ANYTHING BUT DISCRETIONARY

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.041
FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW SO

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.542
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:01.877
THERE IS SOME TYPE OF DEDICATED

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:02.978
REVENUE SOURCE SO THAT THESE

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.513
PROGRAMS ARE INVOLVED BUT

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.581
WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.316
DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THIS --

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.984
AT BOTH OF THESE -- PROPOSED

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.319
REVENUE INCREASES AND WE LOOK

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.720
FOR TO SPEAKING WITH YOU OKAY

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:12.755
AYE AYE PROJECT THAT'S GOING

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.823
TO BE A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.158
TO HAVE A NIGHT JUST SPEAKING

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.128
FOR MYSELF -- I THINK THAT --

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.662
I WOULD PREFER THAT WE SPEND

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:21.597
THAT MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:22.765
FUND WHEN WE HAVE WITH THE

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.299
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.567
AND THEN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.469
ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE ONGOING

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.004
FUNDING MAYBE IN YEARS WHEN

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.973
WE DON'T HAVE THAT SURPLUS AND

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.241
THAT JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:34.076
FOR YOU IS THAT IT'S IN A YEAR

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.377
WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS WE GET

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.312
TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.448
UNMET NEEDS WE GET TO ADDRESS

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.250
IN THE STATE AND ONE THING THAT

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:42.851
I THOUGHT WAS GLARINGLY ABSENT

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:43.786
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:46.188
BUDGET WAS TO ADDRESS THE --

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.923
FOR SHORTFALL IN JUDGES IN

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.591
CALIFORNIA BUT THE JUDICIAL

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.126
COUNCIL IS YOU KNOW SAYS A WERE

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:52.427
A HUNDRED NINETY JUDGES SHORT

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:55.397
RIGHT NOW LAST YEAR THE BUDGET

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.266
PROPOSED TO NEW JUDGES AND THIS

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.901
YEAR THE ADMINISTRATIONS BUDGET

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.335
RIGHT NOW HAS NO NEW JUDGES

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:03.105
IN THERE AND -- I REPRESENT

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.072
SAN BENITO COUNTY WHICH IS

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.841
THE MOST UNDER RESOURCE PART

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:07.276
OF THE SUPPORT IN THE ENTIRE

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:09.011
STATE I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.879
TO TO ME TO SEE THAT I WONDER

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:13.715
WHY THAT DECISION WAS MADE SO

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.150
I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.485
ON THE SPECIFICS FOR A NUMBER

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.986
OF JUDGES BUT THE BUDGET DOES

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:20.022
INCLUDE INCREASES FOR COURTS

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:21.824
IN PUBLIC SAFETY GENERALLY

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.091
BUT ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.393
ALL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:26.461
THINK IT'S MAKING MISTER MISS

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.429
MATHIS HAD A QUICK FOLLOW UP

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.666
ON THE WATER RUSHES LE LET HIM

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.100
THEN YOU MISTER CHAIR WITH WITH

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.336
THE WATER -- I'M GLAD TO SEE

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:35.571
THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY COMMITTED

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:36.605
TO FINALLY DOING SOMETHING

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:39.174
ABOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER -- I

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.176
DO HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.178
THE PROPOSED TAX MEASURES THAT

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:46.081
HE'S TALKED ABOUT PUBLICLY --

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.116
JUST BEING THAT I COME FROM

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:50.419
ROLE COMMUNITY -- VIEW SIDE

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:51.653
PORTABLE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.323
WORK -- ON CLEAN DRINKING WATER

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:55.524
SAID IN A PROGRAMS EVERYTHING

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.359
ELSE AND -- THE PROPOSED

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.327
NUMBERS I'VE SEEN AT LEAST IN

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:01.029
THE MEDIA FROM THE GOVERNOR --

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.965
ARE SERIOUSLY JUST A DROP IN

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.800
THE BUCKET FOR WHAT'S NEEDED

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:06.702
-- EXPRESSLY WITH ON GOING

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:08.937
AND KEEPING -- THESE PLANTS

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.873
RUNNING FOR THESE DISADVANTAGES

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.941
COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE I MEAN

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.109
I'VE BEEN TO SITES WHERE WE

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.777
HAVE BRAND NEW TREATMENT PLANTS

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:16.812
IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE JUST

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.881
TOO POOR TO BE ABLE TO PAY TO

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.849
KEEP THEM RUNNING AND WHAT HE'S

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.584
PROPOSING WITH THANK THE LAST

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:23.652
SUMMER SO I WAS TWENTY FIVE

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.288
MILLION -- TH THAT WOULD COME

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.557
FROM THIS NEW WATER TAX THAT'S

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.626
JUST NOT ENOUGH A AND I'VE GOT

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.060
AGREE WE NEED SOMETHING MORE

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:36.231
PERMANENT -- GENERAL FUND MONEY

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.166
GOING TOWARDS THIS THAT WE CAN

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.167
COUNT ON THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.136
ABLE TO PAY FOR NEW PROJECTS

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.638
AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.307
I WOULD LOVE TO TALK WITH --

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.476
WHOEVER FROM YOUR OFFICE IN THE

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.611
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON A PROPOSAL

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.646
THAT I HAVE THAT I THINK

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.514
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SUITED

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.549
YES SO THAT -- FIRST POINT

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:55.984
IS THE GOVERNOR ABSOLUTELY

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:57.085
AGREES WITH YOU THAT TWENTY

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.387
OR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.922
IS NOT ENOUGH AND HE HAS BEEN

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:01.223
DEMONSTRATED A MORAL COMMITMENT

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.724
TO THESE ISSUES INCLUDING IN

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:03.859
THE CENTRAL ESPECIALLY THE

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.160
CENTRAL VALLEY IN MAKING SURE

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.795
THAT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN THE

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.363
STATE HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.998
DRINKING WATER SO THE TWENTY

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.700
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:12.768
AND ACTUALLY TWENTY MILLION

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.469
DOLLARS OF THAT IS WHAT WE --

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.271
THE COMMITTEE VOTED ON TODAY TO

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.073
MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE THAT --

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.274
THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM BUTTE

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.176
IS REALLY EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.811
FOR EMERGENCY AVAILABILITY AND

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.680
MAKING SURE THAT WATER SYSTEMS

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.281
CAN STEP UP AND BEGIN TO COMPLY

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:27.616
WITH A CLEAN DRINKING WATER

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.384
STANDARDS BUT WE UNDERSTAND

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:30.719
THAT SOLVING THIS ISSUE IN ANY

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.387
SORT OF SIGMUND WIDE WILL TAKE

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.289
MUCH MORE RESOURCES THAN THAT

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:35.524
HOW WE GET THE REVENUE TO DO

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.059
THAT AND WHERE WE SPEND FROM AS

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.093
WE WERE DISCUSSING THE SOMEONE

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.127
NUMBER OBERNOLTE THAT WILL

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:40.963
BE A LONGER CONVERSATION BUT

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:41.930
THAT'S CERTAINLY A COMMITMENT

OVER FOUR BILLION ANNUALLY TO

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.245
THAT WOULD COVER NEW PROJECTS

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.447
PLUS THE MAINTENANCE FOR THEM

01:16:58.513 --> 01:16:59.548
SO LIKE I SAID I'D LOVE TO

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.483

IS VIRTUALLY NON WE HAVE NO

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.040
POSITIVE OUTCOME INVESTMENT

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.608
FOR THE ID POPULATION I'M

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.676

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.811
WITH SOMEBODY WHERE WE CAN

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:05.247
MAKE A TEMPLATE AND BUILD A

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:08.116
PLAN TO GO FORWARD WITH THE ID

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.752
IDT POPULATION -- AGAIN OVER

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.287
THE LAST DECADE JUST TARGETED

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.189
AUG AUGMENTATION WE'VE HAD

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:17.659
AND AND DISMISSED OR DISSOLVE

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.061
THE -- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

IN CALIFORNIA TO SAVE MONEY

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:24.266
BUT YET THE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:26.234
UNDER FUNDED AND WE HAVE

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.903
A NEED FOR SIX HUNDRED AND

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.738
SEVENTY SIX CASE WORKERS IN

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.873
CALIFORNIA TO REGIONAL CENTERS

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.942
-- WE TALK ABOUT POSITIVE

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:37.245
OUTCOMES FOR EARLY EDUCATION

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.313
WE REALLY NEED TO WORK

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.881
ON POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.817
INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.019
JUST LIKE US AND SO I'M LOOKING

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:44.920
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:46.388
ADMINISTRATION ALSO DEPARTMENT

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.123
OF FINANCE HOW WE CAN HAVE A

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.859
GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:54.563
POPULATION IS RECOGNIZED AND

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:58.066
VALUES FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.101
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.335
IN THE BUDGET THAT REALLY

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.904
TARGETS AT TÔI SO LET ME TAKE

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.306
MAKE TWO OR THREE QUICK POINTS

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.240
AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.309
MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET AS WELL

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.810
THE FIRST IS THAT THIS IS AN

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.078
ISSUE THAT WE ARE TRACKING VERY

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.480
CLOSELY SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:13.748
CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND ONE

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:15.383
OF THE REASONS WE HAD MAYBE

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.718
LESS DETAIL IN OUR JANUARY

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.653
PROPOSAL THEN WE HOPE TO HAVE

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.888
IN A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE THE

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.790
BUDGET IS ENACTED IS AS YOU

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:23.125
KNOW THERE IS A RIGHT STUDY

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.993
THAT'S COMING OUT THIS SPRING

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.394
AND SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.662
KNOW ONCE THAT COMES OUT WILL

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:29.297
HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW WE

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.899
WANT TO MOVE IN WHAT DIRECTIONS

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:32.701
HOW MUCH IT'LL COST AND YOU THE

01:19:32.767 --> 01:19:34.102
RATE STUDY DEALS WITH RATES BUT

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.237
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:36.738
OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.273
CHANGE THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.474
AROUND THAT SO THE SYSTEM IS

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.042
ACTUALLY WORKING FOR PEOPLE

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.077
AND ZOOMING OUT FROM THAT

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.612
EVEN AS WE HOPE TO COMMIT MORE

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.013
RESOURCES YOU KNOW WHICH WE

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.448
LIKELY WELL YOU KNOW ONE THAT

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:47.649
RATE STUDY COMES AND WE THINK

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.284
ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP PEOPLE IN

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.019
THESE POPULATIONS WE ALSO HAVE

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.154
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLARS

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.255
ACTUALLY BEING WELL SPENT

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:54.156
AND I KNOW I'M SURE THAT'S A

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.223
PARTY THERE IS A SMALL MAKE

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.291
SURE IT'S GETTING TO THE RIGHT

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:58.393
PLACES AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.961
GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES AND

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:00.896
THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.030
BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TED

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:03.231
FREE SIZE AND OUR K.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:05.133

MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:11.072
MONEY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.374
AND WE HOPE AND EXPECT THAT

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.742
MUCH OF THAT MONEY WILL GO

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:15.010
TOWARD KIDS WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.878
DISABILITIES WHO NEED OUR HELP

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.313
I APPRECIATE THAT AND ONE OF

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.482
THE THINGS THAT REALLY REALLY

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:21.950
I'M HOPING FOR IS WHEN YOU

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:23.318
LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY DUE

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.720
MARCH FIRST -- I MEAN WE HAVE

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.289
INDIVIDUALS THROUGH PROVIDERS

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.257
THAT ARE SENDING OUT REST OF

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:32.527
WORKERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE AND

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:34.129
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:36.264
FULL TIME JOB THERE -- PART

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.500
TIME AT BEST -- THEY CAN MAKE

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.734
MORE MONEY TO LIVE IN PEACE

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.236
AND GETTING TIPS AND TAKING

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.138

THIS HAPPENS WITH FAMILIES

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:52.514

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS IT'S

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.246
SOME NEAR TERM MONEY BUT ALSO

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:32.514
A WILLINGNESS TO LOOK LONG

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.416
TERM THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:35.250
IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.052
IS PRETTY CLEAR ON THIS THAT

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.553
THERE HAS BEEN MONEY AVAILABLE

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.288
FOR CAPITAL COSTS AND FOR

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:41.389
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:44.526
WATER QUALITY BUT NOTHING WITH

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.294
RESPECT TO ONGOING OPERATIONS

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:47.429

IT'S VOLATILITY ENDS ALL OF THE

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.770
VOTER DRIVEN LEGISLATIVE DRIVEN

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.305
CONSTRAINTS ON THE GENERAL

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.708

TO MEET THAT THAT THAT NEED

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.815
I THINK IS IT APPROPRIATE AND

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:07.916
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.751

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:17.292
PERMANENT FOR PERMANENT FUNDING

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.460
TO ADDRESS THE OPERATIONS AND

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:19.961
MAINTENANCE PERSPECTIVE AND

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.363
THAT'S SORT OF HOW I READ THAT

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.732
PROPOSAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.333
TO SEE HOW THAT DEVELOPS OVER

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.835
TIME I THINK THAT'S A VERY

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.737
HEALTHY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:30.372
WE MEET THIS NEED A CRITICAL

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:32.273
NEED ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.341
TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.242
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO TURN ON THE

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.710
TAP AND CAN'T DRINK THE WATER

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:37.579
FROM THEIR TASK THAT SHOULD

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:38.980
BE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ALL OF

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:41.015
US AND BUT WE WE HAVE TO BE

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.317
VERY CAREFUL HOW WE'RE FINDING

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.219
IT AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.820
WE HAVE LONG TERM FUNDING FOR

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:46.888
THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:47.822
PIECES OF IT BECAUSE WILL

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:49.557
ALWAYS BE ABLE TO TO PULL UP

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.760
MONEY FOR CAPITAL COSTS AT ONE

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:53.595
TIME AND USE THAT AS WE DID

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:55.397
WHEN THAT'S GREAT NOW BUT IF

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.265
WE DON'T ADDRESS THE LONG TERM

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.500
AND IF WE T¡I EVERYTHING TO

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.135
THE GENERAL FUND THEN WE WILL

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.269
IN FACT SHORT CHANGE THOSE

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.871
COMMUNITIES OVER TIME WE CAN'T

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:04.038
KEEP DOING THAT AND SO AYE

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.307
DADDY MUST SAY I DO APPRECIATE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.542

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:08.476
ON THIS AND PERSPECTIVE

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.878
ON THIS AND I KNOW WE WILL

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:10.779
BE WORKING ON IT OVER THE

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:14.382
YEARS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:15.216

MURATSUCHI -- A PUBLIC

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:24.159
UP AROUND FROM FROM --

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:25.260
FROM VARIOUS ISSUES BUT IN

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.127
TERMS OF EARLY EDUCATION

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.430
FUNDING HOW MUCH OF THE ONE

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.064
TIME FUNDING WILL GO TO EXPAND

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.833
CAPACITY -- WITH THERE'S

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.868
CERTAINLY A NEED TO TO FIND

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:35.303
-- EARLY EDUCATION SLOTS BUT A

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.438
LOT OF COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:38.440
CAPACITY TO -- TO ACTUALLY

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:39.874
PROVIDE EARLY EDUCATION SO YOU

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.843
CAN SPEND ON THAT YES -- SO

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.278
THERE AND TWO STREAMS OF IT

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:45.213
THE FIRST IS FOR KINDERGARTEN

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.981
CAPACITY AND AS YOU KNOW

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:48.783
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE UNIVERSAL

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.685
KINDERGARTEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.320
NOT EVERYBODY HAS A FULL DAY

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.955
OPTION IN FACT ABOUT TWENTY

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.490
PERCENT IT'S I BELIEVE IT

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:57.592
DISTRICTS -- ONLY DON'T OFFER

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.227
A FULL DAY OPTION TO ALL

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:00.929
ELIGIBLE KINDERGARTENERS AND

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.130
A LOT OF THAT AS YOU MENTIONED

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.765
IS A CAPACITY ISSUE SO THIS

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.400
BUDGET PROPOSES IN ONE TIME

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.101
FINDING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.304
MILLION DOLLARS TO RETROFIT

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.072
THESE CLASSROOMS -- BUILD NEW

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.841
CLASSROOMS AS NEEDED AND MAKING

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.042
SURE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:15.477
CLASSROOMS FOR KINDERGARTNERS

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.011
WITH BATHROOM SET UP IN THE

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.213
WAY THE TEACHERS ARE THEY

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.514
HAVE TO BE RETROFITTED IN A

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:20.849
CERTAIN WAY SO WE'RE HOPING

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:21.850
THAT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.284
MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO A

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.520
LONG WAY THE OTHER EXTREME OF

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:26.588
ONE TIME FINDING THAT BEARS

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:27.989
MENTIONING IS FIVE HUNDRED

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.924
MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS FOR

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.559
CHILD CARE WHICH IS ALSO A BIG

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:32.927
PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.263
EXPANDING ACCESS TO CHILDCARE

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:36.865
AND THIS IS BOTH FOR CHILD

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.900
CARE FACILITY CAPACITY AS

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.568
WELL AS TRAINING OF THE CHILD

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:41.736
CARE WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.104
ALSO HAVE A WORK FORCE ISSUE

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:44.739
THERE -- IT'S IF WE WANT TO

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:45.707
IMPROVE CHILD CARE WE NEED TO

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.975
MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPROVE THE

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:48.743
NUMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:49.944
SAID THOSE TWO TOGETHER COME

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.546
TO ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.847
DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.215
IS THERE A FORMULA IN TERMS

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:57.952
OF HOW THE RESOURCES WILL BE

01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.921
-- ALLOCATED IS IT DOESN'T GO

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.656
BY POPULATION DOES IT GO BY

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:04.492
WAIT LIST AS A GO BY REGION

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.593
SO WE HAVEN'T PUT THAT IN THE

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.028
JANUARY BUDGET BUT I'LL LET MY

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.496
COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES SPEAK

HAVE APPLIED FOR THE FUNDS AND

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.851
AND IN PRIOR YEARS WE'VE HAD

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.519
LANGUAGE AROUND PRIORITIZATION

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.121
FOR AREAS OF THE STATE THAT

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:35.189
HAVE RELATIVELY LOW ACCESS

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.225
CAPACITY AT THIS POINT -- JUST

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.393
IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:39.761
THE ACCESS IS AN ISSUE IT'S

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:42.096
NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.698
THANK YOU -- IN TERMS OF GOING

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:46.401

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.437
ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:51.906
LINK TRANSPORTATION FUNDS --

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:56.678
TO A REGION'S HOUSING -- NEEDS

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:57.612
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.980
GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PROPOSAL

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.448
THERE'S A SHORT TERM POCKET

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:02.383
AND A LONGER TERM POCKET FOR

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.785
THE SHORTER TERM BALK AT THAT

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:04.986
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.187
DOLLARS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:07.855
NINE DOLLARS AND TECHNICAL

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:09.090
AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.191
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE WILLING

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:11.659
TO STEP UP AND THEN FIVE

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:12.994
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:14.262
THESE JURISDICTIONS MEET THEIR

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:15.897
MILESTONES SO THAT HOUSING

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.966
PROCESS IS NOT RELATED TO SB

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.500
WINE OR ANY OTHER I NEED THE

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.469
OTHER TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:22.737
THAT BEING SAID WHEN IT COMES

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.138
TO THE LONGER TERM ISSUE IN THE

01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:25.974
ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED SAT

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.275
LOOKING AT THIS AND REACHING

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.843
THESE GOALS OVER THE LONG TERM

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.244
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE RENO

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.813
PROCESS FOR SETTING REGIONAL

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.448
HOUSING GOALS IN CONCERT WITH

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.149
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NEEDS TO

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.884
BE REVAMPED AND THAT ONCE WE DO

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.720
THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE A WAY

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.054
OF HOLDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:41.923
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MEETING

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.924
THEIR HOUSING GOALS BECAUSE

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.425
WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS HERE

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.227
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:48.196
HAS SUGGESTED THAT ONE WAY

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.530
OF HOLDING JURISDICTIONS

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.899
ACCOUNTABLE IS WITHHOLDING SOME

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.434
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IF THEY

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.069
DO NOT MEET THOSE GOALS NOW

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.237
THE WAITED THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.805
DO THAT -- AS I MENTIONED THIS

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:59.140
IS A LONGER TERM PROPOSITION

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:00.541
SO IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THIS

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:01.876
CURRENT YEAR IT'S NOT HAPPENING

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.544
IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE DETAILS

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.345
OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:05.313
WANT TO WORK OUT WITH LOCAL

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.481
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE WANT

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:07.749
THESE GOALS THEY WILL BE HARD

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:08.950
FOR SOME COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:09.851
BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.519
HOPELESS THEY'RE DESIGNED AS

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.720
PART OF THAT REVAMPS PROCESS

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.322
TO BE ACHIEVABLE AND I THINK

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:14.989
THE OTHER THING THAT THE

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:16.090
ADMINISTRATION IS SIGNALED

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:18.259
IS THAT IF DOWN THE ROAD A

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.460
COMMUNITY IS NOT MEETING ITS

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:20.728
HOUSING GOALS AND SOME OF

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.697
THAT SB ONE MONIES BUT HELD

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:23.798
ITS NOT COMPLETELY TAKEN

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:25.767
AWAY IT'S A JURISDICTIONS GET

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:27.468
BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.670
HOUSING GOALS THAT WE'VE ALL

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.538
COMMITTED TO THEY WILL BE ABLE

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.240
TO ACCESS THAT MONEY SO WE

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.374
KNOW THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:34.909
AROUND THIS PROPOSAL IT'S A

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.611
LONGER TERM PROPOSITION AND

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:37.512
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:38.579
WITH YOU ON DESIGNING IT SO

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:39.614
THAT IT ACTUALLY CHIEF THE

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:43.251
GOALS FOR WHICH IT'S INTENDED

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.118
I DON'T KNOW IF IT DID

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:46.487
YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE AT

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.022
-- I THINK THE CONCERN THERE

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:49.857
IS THAT IS CERTAINLY THE THE

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:50.925
GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED THAT

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.260
HOUSING TRANSMISSION ARE ARE

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:55.663
LINKED IT IN MANY INSTANCES AS

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.565
IF THEY CAN'T BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:59.600
HOUSING THEN YOU'RE FORCING

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.768
INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FURTHER

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:03.271
AWAY AND SO I THINK FROM FROM

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:04.772
MANY INSTANCES I DON'T KNOW

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.107
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S FAIR TO

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.209
LINK TRANSPORTATION TO HOUSING

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:10.411
GOALS IF YOU THINK YOU SIX

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.879
TAKE A STEP BACK THERE'S OTHER

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.815
CIRCUMSTANCES AT RK THE ART IN

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:17.218
THE CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:18.086
SO WHAT I THINK THE

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.088
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IS THAT

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.456
THAT THAT COULD THAT COULD BE

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.590
CRISES ARE RIGHT NOW HOUSING

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.225
CRISIS IS LYING TO YOU KNOW

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.727
LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:27.195
SO WE DEFINITELY DO AGREE THERE

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.763
THAT THESE TWO THINGS GO HAND

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.631
IN HAND BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:31.999
THEY THEY CONVERGE TOGETHER

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.201
AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND THAT

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:34.669
WHEN YOU BUILD MORE HOUSING

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:35.670
YOU SHOULD BE REWARDED WITH

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:36.971
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS BECAUSE

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.372
A LOT OF WHAT STOPS LOCAL

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.941
JURISDICTIONS FROM BUILDING

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.109
HOUSING IN THE FIRST PLACE IS

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.009
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE I DON'T

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:43.711
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:44.879
TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED NUMBER

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.013
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE SO

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.482
WE ACTUALLY THINK THESE THINGS

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:48.850
WORK TOGETHER YOU DO HAVE A

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.451
GOOD POINT AND THAT DIFFERENT

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.819
JURISDICTIONS ARE DIFFERENT

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:52.754
AND COMMUNITIES IN THE

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:53.955
CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.323
CHALLENGES THANKS COMMITTEES

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.891
ON THE COAST AND THAT'S WHY

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:58.259
THE PRECURSOR TO ALL OF THIS

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.527
IS REVAMPING THE WAY THAT

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:00.695
WE SENT THESE HOUSING GOALS

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.230
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY WANT THEM

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.731
TO MAKE SENSE AND WE BELIEVE

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.533
THAT ONCE THEY DO MAKE SENSE

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.901
DAN AND WE CAN LINK HOUSING

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.603
TRANSPORTATION TOGETHER AND

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:09.904
AND DO YOU HAVE A FORMULA AND

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:11.939
TERMS OF THESE GOALS ARE HOW

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.074
DO YOU DETERMINE THESE RICH

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.342
UNCLES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.610
WE HAVE TO WORK OUT DON'T ONE

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:16.644
THING THAT WE DO KNOW IS THE

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.945
CURRENT REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.213
ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT WE

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.281
HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW NEEDS

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:24.051
UPDATING OKAY -- JUMPING TO

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.320

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:38.432
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SO IN THIS

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.034
IN THIS CURRENT IN THIS BUDGET

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.269
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.870
LOOKING AT OPTIONS OKAY THE

JUST SO THAT EVERYONE OPERATE

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.085
ON THE SAME INFORMATION WHAT

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.988
IS THE ESTIMATED UNFUNDED

I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.463
TO BREAK IT DOWN ACROSS THE

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.065
DIFFERENT FUNDS -- WHAT'S THE

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:47.235
TOTAL -- THE TOTAL HERE I THINK

01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:50.404
I HAVE IT HERE SO FOR CALPERS

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:51.706
IT'S FIFTY NINE BILLION AND

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.974
FOR CAL STIRS IT'S A HUNDRED

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.276
AND FOUR AND BILLION DOLLARS

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.145
-- BUT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE --

01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.847
-- HEALTH CARE RETIREE HEALTH

CARE BENEFITS AND I HAVE TO GET

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:02.516
BACK TO YOU ON ON THE TO ABOUT

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:03.784
WHAT THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.286
TO IN THAT ASSUMES A SEVEN

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.555
PERCENT RATE OF RETURN FOR

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.658
CAL'S SPURS YES CAL STIRS I'D

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:12.860
HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK SO IN THE

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:15.329
MODELING THAT THAT YOU'VE DONE

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:17.265
IF EVER RECESSION DID OCCUR HOW

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:20.935
DOES THE STATE RESPOND TO THE

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:22.737
FUNDING THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:25.039
SO WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF OUR

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:26.641
RECESSION MODELING IS WE LOOK

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:30.177
AT -- WHETHER OR NOT BE --

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:32.380
REVENUES AND RESERVES WOULD

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:34.148
BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR THE

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.350
ON GOING COSTS TO THE STATES

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:39.654
SO -- IN TERMS OF HOW THAT

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.621
INTERACTS WITH THE PENSION

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:42.189
LIABILITIES JUST NOT MUCH JUST

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.125
USE THE CALPERS EXAMPLE TO

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:46.027
THE EXTENT CALPERS EXPERIENCES

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:47.328
LOSSES BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:48.529
RECESSION AND THE MARKET GOES

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.865
DOWN CALPERS WOULD ADJUST THE

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:52.166
RATES THAT THE STATE HAS TO

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.834
PAY TO CALPERS WHICH WOULD

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.469
INCREASE OUR ONGOING COSTS

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:58.539
SO -- UNDER OUR MODELING FOR

01:32:58.606 --> 01:32:59.807
SORT OF A YEAR TO YEAR BUDGET

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.343
SCENARIO WE DO TRY TO BUILD IN

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.245
HOW THOSE ONGOING COSTS CHANGE

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:05.613
AND WHAT THE COSTS OF THE STATE

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.281
WOULD BE IN TERMS OF ONGOING

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:09.083
PROGRAMMATIC COSTS INCLUSIVE

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:12.687
OF -- ODD SALARIES AND AND

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:13.888
AND PENSION PAYMENTS AND THAT

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.156
SORT OF THING BUT WE DON'T

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.390
MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:18.526
PAYING DOWN INCREASED UNFUNDED

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:20.194
LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF A

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:23.597
MARKET DECLINE UPDATE IT TO THE

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.565
PIPELINE IS IT G.

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.167
IS YOUR NUMBERS QUICK TO YOUR

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.668
NUMBERS CORRELATE IN TERMS OF

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.103
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT THE

THIS IS JUST FOR THE -- PAD

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:48.089
MIGHT DEPEND ON WHAT DISCOUNT

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:49.623
RATE THAT YOU'RE USING BUT

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.459

IF YOU ADD UP THE NINETY ONE

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.329
BILLION THAT JUST A SHADE

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:56.330
OVER A HUNDRED BILLION FOR

SO I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:36.116
-- IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE

01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:38.819
FIRST IS THAT THIS BUDGET

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.154
DOES PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.288
TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.757
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.025
AS YOU MENTIONED IT PROVIDES

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.460
THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:47.695
STIRS OBLIGATIONS OF WHICH

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:48.629
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.264
DOLLARS WILL FLOW DIRECTLY

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:51.398
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THREE

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:52.900
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.401
IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING TO OFFER

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.403

MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS BUT IT

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.341
SHIFTED SOME PRE K.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:01.842
MONEY FOR NON LOCAL EDUCATION

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.544
AGENCIES -- OUTSIDE OF THE

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:04.812
PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEED

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:07.047
THEREBY CREATING MORE -- ROOM

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:07.881
THAT WE CAN USE FOR OTHER

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.450
PRIORITIES SUCH AS K.

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:11.151
TWELVE SCHOOLS SO WE DO THINK

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.820
THAT THIS IS A BIG COMMITMENT

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.755
IT'S THE HIGHEST EVER LEVEL --

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:17.625
THAT BEING SAD -- THERE WHEN IT

01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:19.193
COMES TO EDUCATION WE KNOW THAT

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.761
WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE WORK TO DO

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:21.996
AND THE KEY QUESTION IS REALLY

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.597
FINDING WAYS HOW TO DO THAT

01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:24.798
IN THIS BUDGET WE THINK WE'VE

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:26.500
PROVIDED WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:27.501
STRONG BASE FOR K.

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.169
TWELVE EDUCATION IN THE STATE

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.137
CONSISTENT WITH OUR OTHER

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:31.472
PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO A

01:38:31.538 --> 01:38:33.374
CHILD CARE AND EARNED INCOME

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.175
TAX CREDIT AND CAL WORKS IN

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.710
HIGHER EDUCATION WHERE WE ALSO

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.245
WANTED TO PROVIDE A STRONG

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:39.947
ON GOING INCREASE AFTER YEARS

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.615
WHEN THE SYSTEMS RECEIVED --

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:42.816
LAST AND THEY MIGHT HAVE WANTED

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.885
A ROSTER FOR -- BUT WE ALSO

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:45.819
UNDERSTAND THAT WITH K.

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:47.421
TWELVE THERE IS A DEMAND FOR

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:48.889
MORE AND WE SAW THAT AS YOU

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.624

ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO DO THAT

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.032
BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THESE

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.466

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.328
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHAT

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:50.397
WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:51.765
HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK TOGETHER

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.333
WITH THE GOVERNOR OF TO MOVE

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.569
ON TO PRESENT THE MOST AFFECTED

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.137
PROGRAMS AND BE QUITE FRANK

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.373
WITH YOU OF THE ONES THAT DON'T

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:00.807
WORK TO MY STATE KIND OF JUST

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:03.176
CREE BUSY WORK -- WE MOVE THAT

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.978
FUNDING FROM THEM INTO THE

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.713
MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT --

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.849
PROGRAMS SO IT'S KIND OF A TWO

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:11.818
FOLD QUESTION -- I'M EXCITED

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:14.021
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH DJJ

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.188
BUT I'M I'M A LITTLE WORRIED

01:43:15.255 --> 01:43:16.490
ABOUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:18.025
PROGRAM IF WE HAVE ONE WE HAVE

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:19.159
ANY IDEAS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:20.193
TO DO AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.662
HAPPEN AND THEN THE SECOND

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:24.298
PART -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOW

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:25.465
WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE REAL

01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:27.000
BILL TATIAN PROGRAM AND CDC

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.669
ARE HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.237
THE LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN MOVE

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.372
QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT IS THE

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.808
MOST EFFECTIVE UP PROGRAM --

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:37.644
THAT WE COULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.513
SO A COUPLE POINTS I WANT TO

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.348
MAKE FIRST IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:43:41.415 --> 01:43:42.516
RIGHT THAT WE MADE A LOT OF

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:43.650
PROGRESS OVER THE LAST EIGHT

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.719
YEARS UNDER AB ONE OH NINE AND

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:47.020
REDUCE THE STATE POPULATION

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:48.689
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:50.290
BY AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:52.125
PEOPLE AND WE'RE EXPECTING

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.794
WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.729
THAT SEVERAL ADDITION --

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:56.930
SEVERAL THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.298
PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED

01:43:58.365 --> 01:43:59.266
WILL BE RELEASED UNDER THAT

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.867
PROGRAM FOR CREDITS AND GOOD

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:03.070
BEHAVIOR BUT THAT BEING SAID

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:04.204
AS YOU NOTED WE DON'T WANT TO

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.039
FUMBLE ON THE GOAL LINE AND WE

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:06.907
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:07.908
ARE GETTING THE SERVICES AND

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:09.710
SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED AND

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.912
SO WE NOTICED IN THIS BUDGET

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:12.913
WHEN YOU TRACK OVER THE LAST

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.748
SIX OR SEVEN YEARS THE LEVEL

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.283
FUNDING FOR REHABILITATION IS

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:17.851
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.620
OF BONDS WHAT IT WAS IN TWENTY

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.388
TWELVE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.789
YOUR POINT EXACTLY IT'S ONE

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.024
THING TO SPEND THE MONEY BUT

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:24.992
IT'S ANOTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.259
IT'S BEING SPENT WHILE AND THE

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:27.928
GOVERNOR IS VERY INTENTIONAL

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.296
ABOUT THIS HE HAS THIS PHRASE

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:30.731
IS NOT JUST ABOUT RESOURCES

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:32.265
IT'S ABOUT RESOURCEFULNESS AND

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:33.867
IT APPLIES HERE PERHAPS MORE

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.669
THAN ANY OTHER AREA SO I KNOW

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.104
THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.238
WE WILL WANT TO CONTINUE TO

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.606
HAVE WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WHEN

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.074
IT COMES SPECIFICALLY TO HIS

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:43.076
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS HE'S

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:44.978
VERY INVESTED IN LITERACY AND

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.880
THIS BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:48.782
FUNDING FOR LITERACY COACHES

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:50.217
IN OUR PRISONS INCLUDING PEOPLE

LEARN TO READ BECAUSE THE

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:56.223

OF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:59.726

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:04.031
OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY GET OUT

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:05.298
BUT THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:06.566
THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.435

THIS BUDGET THAT WILL HELP US

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:17.397
TO DO JUST THAT DOCTOR WOULD

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:19.099
HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO LOOK

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.934
AT SUBSIDIES THAT WILL ALSO

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:23.570
AFFECT NOT JUST THE ACCESS TO

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.505
CARE BUT THE IN AFFORDABILITY

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.741
OF CARE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:29.576
PLAN IN HEALTH CARE WHICH IS

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:32.312
DON'T GET SEC PEOPLE WILL HAVE

01:47:32.379 --> 01:47:33.780
A CRISIS AND ISSUES IN THEIR

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:34.848
LIVES AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.216
OUT HOW HEALTH CARE CAN BE

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.218
AFFORDABLE FOR THE VAST MIDDLE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.220
CLASS IN OUR STATE WHO DOES

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:42.489
NOT HAVE THAT CURRENT ABILITY

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:44.791
AND YES I AM QUITE EXCITED

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:46.593
THAT WHEN HE SAID THAT EVERYONE

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:50.597
CARE THAT HE MEANT EVERYONE

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:52.065
AND WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN OUR

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:53.533
FIRST STEPS THIS YEAR THERE

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.702
WILL BE MORE ADVOCACY TO MAKE

01:47:55.769 --> 01:47:57.237
SURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO TAKE

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:58.438
CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:00.006
VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:02.142
AND I HAVE A PARTICULAR SPOT

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.177
REALLY LOOKING AT THE ELDERS

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:06.179
WITHIN MANY OF OUR CULTURES AND

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:07.647
COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.816
WE TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO HAVE

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:11.852
GIVEN SO MUCH TO US AND REALLY

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.253
WOULD WANT US TO CONTINUE

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.188
TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:17.390
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:20.126
THAT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:21.461
THAT WE INCREASE OUR SAFETY

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.630
NET RESERVE FUND SO WE DON'T

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:25.799
ENTER INTO THE PARADOX WHICH

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:27.667
OCCURS WHEN WE WILL HAVE OUR

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.769
NEXT RECESSION WILL PROVIDE

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.371
US THE BUDGET RESILIENCY TO

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:33.039
CONTINUE TO MEET THE DEMANDS

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:35.408
OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:48:35.475 --> 01:48:36.943
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TALK

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:37.777
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HUMAN

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.179
SERVICES BECAUSE THAT'S STILL

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.547
IN SOME OF THE JURISDICTION

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:42.949
THAT WE WORK ON BUT WORKING

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:44.751
TO END CHILDHOOD POVERTY AND

01:48:44.818 --> 01:48:46.186
GETTING US TO FIFTY PERCENT OF

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.221
CAL WORKS IS A NOBLE GOAL AND

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:49.389
WANTS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:52.058
LA -- IF I CAN ON SPECIFICALLY

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:53.627
HOW DOING IT ACROSS THE BOARD

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:55.095
DOESN'T GET CERTAIN FAMILIES

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:57.597
TO THAT GOAL MAKING CASH OUT

01:48:57.664 --> 01:49:00.567
PERMANENT IS A NOBLE GOAL ONE

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.202
THAT WE HELPED TO CHAMPION LAST

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:04.004
YEAR AND ONE THAT WE NEED TO

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:05.505
CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:07.908
HELP THOSE WHO ARE DISABLED WHO

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:10.010
ARE ELDERLY AND HAVE NEEDS BE

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:12.712
ABLE TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:14.648
I WANTED TO AND IF I COULD

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:17.918
ACTUALLY ON A QUESTION WE HAD

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:20.387
TALKED ABOUT MCO TAX BUT I

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:23.089
WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS NOT

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.791
INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.593
AND AND I'M WONDERING WHAT

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:30.130
THE LOGIC IS TO NOT CONTINUE

01:49:30.196 --> 01:49:31.798
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN IN

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:33.066
EFFECT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:34.968
YEARS AND WHAT THE CURRENT

01:49:35.035 --> 01:49:36.503
THINKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:39.572
IS IN -- IN THAT FRAME AND

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:41.975
HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:43.977
TOWARDS THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.645
IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:46.980
IT WOULD PROVIDE THROUGH THE

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:49.349
MCO TAX AND UNDERSTAND THE

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:52.352
THINKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.353
CAROLINE YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.522
CAL WORKS AND THEN WE CAN

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.823
SEE I TALK OFF LINE IF WE CAN

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.091
ON CAL WORKS SUCH A GREAT OF

01:49:58.158 --> 01:49:59.926
SURE SOUNDS GOOD SO ON THE

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:01.761
NCO TAX WHEN WE WERE PUTTING

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.229
TOGETHER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:04.464
IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER AND

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:05.799
AS YOU KNOW IN AN ELECTION

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.600
YEAR THE GOVERNOR BASICALLY

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:09.502
AFTER HERE SHE'S ELECTED HAS

01:50:09.569 --> 01:50:10.870
ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS TO

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.572
PUT TOGETHER THIS IN THIS CASE

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:13.707
TWO HUNDRED NINE BILLION DOLLAR

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:16.509
BUDGET WE WERE UNCERTAIN ABOUT

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:18.278
WHETHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:19.512
WOULD APPROVE THE WAIVER THAT'S

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:21.514
NECESSARY FOR A CONTINUATION

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:23.984
OF THE NCO TAX -- SINCE THEN

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.051
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.219
HAVE BEEN SOME SIGNALS THAT

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:27.354
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.122
MORE LIKELY TO APPROVED SUCH

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:30.423
A WAIVER THAN WE OTHERWISE

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.925
MAY I THOUGHT WITH THAT BEING

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:33.626
SAID -- WE BUILT OUR BUDGET

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.495
WE THINK IT'S A GOOD BUDGET

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:36.596
-- AND WE BUILT IT WITHOUT

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:39.733
THAT AND CO TAX EXTENDING PAST

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:42.102
JULY SO WE THOUGHT WE'D FIND

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:43.570
EVERYTHING THAT WE NEEDED AND

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:44.838
WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WAIVERS

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.072
THAT WERE NEGOTIATING OVER THE

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.874
NEXT TWO YEARS WITH THE FEDERAL

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:49.075
GOVERNMENT AND WE WANTED TO

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:50.744
PLACE A PRIORITY ON THOSE

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.912
WAIVERS THAT SAID WE KNOW THAT

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:54.280
MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:55.148
ARE INTERESTED IN THE

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:57.150
CONTINUATION OF THIS TAX AND

01:50:57.217 --> 01:50:57.917
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.219
YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT YEAH YOU

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:00.520
MAY HAVE NOTICED THEIR SIXTY

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:03.590
ONE OF US NOW WITHIN OUR CAUCUS

01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:05.191
MANY MORE OF US ON THIS BUDGET

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:06.626
CHAIR SUCH THAT WE'VE HAD TO

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.228
CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE SEATS

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:13.233
AND AND ALL WE MUST FIGURE

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.934
OUT HOW TO MAINTAIN FISCAL

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:18.872
DISCIPLINE WE ALSO NEED TO

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.407
THEY'RE AT SO I REALLY DO HOPE

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.409
WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:24.611
-- I DID WANT TO HAVE ONE FINAL

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:25.779
QUESTION AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.747
REGARDING THE -- PROPOSAL

01:51:27.814 --> 01:51:30.483
REGARDING PRESCRIPTIONS -- I'M

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.685
INTERESTED TO HAVE A LITTLE

01:51:32.752 --> 01:51:34.020
BIT MORE MEAT ON THAT BONE

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:36.222
AND TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:39.592
PROPOSAL IS -- WE AS A STATE

01:51:39.659 --> 01:51:41.261
SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING

01:51:41.327 --> 01:51:42.796
POWER OF THE THIRD OF ALL

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.831
CALIFORNIANS AND JUST REALLY

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:46.166
I'M HOPING YOU CAN ELUCIDATE

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:50.370
SOME OF THE -- -- IDEAS OR

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:52.539
IDEALS THAT WE CAN BE STRIVING

01:51:52.605 --> 01:51:56.176
FOR -- WITH THAT PROPOSAL

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:57.477
IT'S ALL MAKE TWO POINTS ON

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:59.179
THAT PROPOSAL IT'S CLEARLY A

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.814
PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:01.948
THE GOVERNOR AND HIS FIRST OR

01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:03.850
SECOND DAY IN OFFICE SIGNED AN

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:06.252
EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING THE

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:07.253
REST THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.955
FORWARD TOWARD THAT PROPOSAL

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:10.023
AND THE REASON HE DID IT SO

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.357
EARLY IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:12.692
SO IMPORTANT BUT BECAUSE IT

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.427
WILL TAKE TIME A PROPOSAL OF

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:16.329
THIS MAGNITUDE AFFECTING THIS

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:18.164
MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SO

01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:19.399
THE WAY WE'RE ESTIMATING IT

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:20.500
RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:23.103
FINANCE THEIR THEIR TWO MAJOR

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.971
PROBLEMS THIS PROPOSAL ONE IS

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:27.440
TO TRANSFER THAT MEDICAID OR

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:29.109
MEDICARE AL -- BENEFIT TO A

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:30.343
FEE FOR SERVICE BENEFIT FOR

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.778
PHARMACY THAT'S MANAGED ACROSS

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:33.780
THE POPULATION AND NOT SIMPLY

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:35.014
MANAGED CARE PLAN BY MANAGED

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.649
CARE PLANS AND SAID THAT WOULD

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.551
PUT THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE

01:52:38.618 --> 01:52:40.153
SOME ODD IN THAT SAME POOL

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.721
AND WOULD MAKE OUR NEGOTIATING

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:43.189
LEVERAGE MUCH STRONGER WHEN

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:44.724
IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING THESE

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.359
DRUGS NOW HOW WE DO THAT AND

01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:48.094
THE CONTOURS OF A THOSE ARE

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:49.262
THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.430
NOT ONLY HAS TO WORK OUT IN

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:51.531
TERMS OF WHAT'S THE SMARTEST

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:53.266
PROPOSAL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:54.300
GET A SENSE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:55.802
GOVERNMENT OF WHAT WE ARE ABLE

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:57.170
AND NOT ABLE TO DO AND THAT

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:59.139
WILL BE AN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:00.640
THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:01.808
THEN THE SECOND PART OF IT IS

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:03.343
THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:05.278
COLLABORATE AS AND THIS IS

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:06.946
OTHER ORGANISER OTHER ENTITIES

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:07.881
WITHIN CALIFORNIA STATE

01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:09.549
GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S IT'S

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.618
EGS OR YOU KNOW CORRECTION

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:13.219
IN OTHER OTHER GROUPS THAT --

01:53:13.286 --> 01:53:14.888
CAN BAND TOGETHER AND AGAIN

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:15.922
GET THE LEVERAGE THAT COMES

01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:17.624
FROM STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:18.925
SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:20.293
PROPOSING THERE IS MAKING A

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.728
WEST OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:24.297
COST MOST USED DRUGS AND

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:25.765
SEEING WHERE WE CAN NEGOTIATE

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:27.400
AND REDUCE THOSE COSTS BUT

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:28.668
I WILL SAY THAT ACROSS THIS

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:30.203
INITIATIVE IN OUR BUDGET WE'RE

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:31.271
SITTING HERE IN JANUARY OF

01:53:31.337 --> 01:53:33.339
TWENTY NINETEEN -- WE DON'T

01:53:33.406 --> 01:53:35.542
EXPECT SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:37.210
NOT THIS YEAR NOT NEXT YEAR

01:53:37.277 --> 01:53:38.878
AND REALLY NOT IN MANY WAYS

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:40.046
THE YEAR AFTER IT REALLY ONLY

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:41.114
STARTS TO KICK IN AND TWENTY

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.782
TWENTY ONE LATER IN THE YEAR

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:44.217
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:53:44.284 --> 01:53:45.818
THREE IN ON WORDS AND THAT'S

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:46.920
WHAT WE'RE SEEING THE BENEFITS

01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:48.888
OF THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED WE

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:50.190
KNOW WE HAD ISSUES WITH SOME

01:53:50.256 --> 01:53:51.491
COMMUNITY HOSPITALS RELATED

TO THREE FORTY B.

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:54.194
SO WE WANT TO START EARLY

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.161
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.729

ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:32.558
WAS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:33.926
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP

01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:35.561
THEM ACHIEVE THESE GOALS WE

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:36.596
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALSO

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:37.897
HAVE A POT OF MONEY SO THAT

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:39.265
WHEN THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:40.833
STEP UP AND THEY TO DO THE

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.669
RIGHT THING TAKING AT ACCESS

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:43.636
TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:44.904
DOLLAR MARKET AND MAKING USE

01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:46.072
THAT FOR ANY GOALS THAT THEY

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:47.273
HAVE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.075
BE HOUSING SO WE WANT TO WORK

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:50.176
JURISDICTIONS THAT DO THE RIGHT

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:51.611
THING AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:52.679
THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES AS

01:55:52.745 --> 01:55:54.147
WELL AND IF YOU STEP UP IN THIS

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:56.015
AREA YOU'LL HAVE MORE RESOURCES

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:57.817
TO DO MORE IN OTHER AREAS TOO

01:55:57.884 --> 01:55:59.285
OKAY I THINK I I THINK THAT'S

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:00.420
VERY INTERESTING AND I LOOK

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:02.855
FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:04.390
IT -- AND I DO THINK THAT IT'S

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:06.859
A GOOD IDEA TO BE INCENTIVIZING

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:08.928
OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO

01:56:08.995 --> 01:56:11.497
MORE THE GOVERNOR -- CLEARLY

01:56:11.564 --> 01:56:13.132
IS USING A CARROT AND STICK

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:14.701
APPROACH -- WE'VE READ A LOT

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.235
ABOUT THE THE STICK IN THE

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.937
NEWSPAPER IN RECENT RECENT

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:20.740
DAYS -- AND I THINK ALL THIS

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:23.676
IS WORTHY OF -- OF -- OF

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.245
DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD ON --

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:28.848
-- ONE THINK -- -- THEN I THINK

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:30.917
ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED

01:56:30.983 --> 01:56:33.853
IS FINDING WAYS TO LOWER THE

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:36.522
COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:39.425
AFFORDABLE AND TO A MARKET RATE

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:40.893
HOUSING BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.596
GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE IS

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:45.398
THAT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:47.233
OF THE UNIT OF FOR EXAMPLE A

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.669
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS IN THE

01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:51.037
RANGE OF A HALF MILLION DOLLARS

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.072
PER UNIT OR SO AND SO THERE'S A

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:56.042
LOT OF MONEY -- -- IN NORTHERN

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:57.043
CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN

01:56:57.110 --> 01:56:59.545
CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN --

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:01.848
APPROVED AND IN THE -- A STATE

01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:03.716
BUDGET THAT'S BEEN APPROVED FOR

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:05.184
FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION BUT IT

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:08.454
ONLY GOES SO FAR SEE YOU HAVE A

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.491
BILLION DOLLAR SEA AND -- -- --

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:12.792
FINDING IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.627
MONEY BUT IT ONLY BUILT ABOUT

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.763
TWO THOUSAND UNITS AT A TIME

01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:18.898
WHEN WE NEED FAR MORE THAN THAT

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:22.068
AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:25.938
-- -- FINDING WAYS TO -- -- A

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:28.107
SPEND NOT ONLY SPEND THAT MONEY

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:31.377
EFFICIENTLY BUT -- -- CHEN

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:33.379
UPPER ABILITY THERE TO TO BUILD

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:37.383
IT QUICKLY -- OF ONE OF THE --

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:39.252
ELEMENTS OF THE CRISIS THAT ARE

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:40.653
NOT BEING MET THE GOVERNOR'S

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.723
SPOKEN ABOUT THIS IS -- -- THE

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.625
INCREDIBLE PRESSURE THAT --

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:47.360
OF PEOPLE RENTAL HOUSING OR

01:57:47.427 --> 01:57:48.961
FEELING GOT WITH RESPECT TO

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:52.432
THEIR -- IS TO THE RENTS AND

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:54.033
-- WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION ON

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.401
THAT BUT WE NEED TO GET UNITS

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:56.936
ONLINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:59.205
SO THAT WE CAN MODERATE THE

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:01.507
-- -- IN AN INCREASE IN COST

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:03.443
BY -- INCREASING THE SUPPLY

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:05.845
OF HOUSING OUT THERE -- AND

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:07.280
I DON'T SEE ANY MONEY IN THE

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:09.782
BUDGET FOR THAT TO KIND OF

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:12.685
-- -- THING AND -- -- I'D

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:13.586
LIKE THAT TO BE PART OF THE

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:16.022
CONVERSATION GOING ON ARMS OF

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.857
A LASTING ON HOUSING I WANTED

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:21.727

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.830
YOU MENTIONED TO REVAMPING

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:26.999
THE RENEWAL PROCESS -- THAT'S

01:58:27.066 --> 01:58:29.168
SOMETHING THAT WE DID IN AB

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:31.804
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE LAST YEAR

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:34.140
WHY DO I KNOW THAT THAT WAS

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:36.709
MY BILL -- SO I'M INTERESTED

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:39.745
IN KNOWING WHAT ELSE -- THE

01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:41.180
GOVERNOR IS LOOKING AT IN TERMS

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:45.017
OF -- OF IMPROVING -- -- THAT

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.786
PROCESS AND I'M INTERESTED IN

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.921
FURTHERING THAT CONVERSATION

THAT NOW BUT THIS IS MORE IN

01:58:54.727 --> 01:58:55.728
THE NATURE OF ASK YOU THESE

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:57.430
QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:58.698
THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING

01:58:58.764 --> 01:59:00.867
FORWARD THAN THAT -- I'LL HAVE

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:03.436
ANOTHER QUESTION ON -- -- --

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:06.205
FIRE -- ABSOLUTELY I'LL MAKE

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:07.373
A TWO OR THREE VERY QUICK

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.075
POINTS -- BEFORE MOVING ON FOR

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.810
FIRE THE FIRST IS THAT AS YOU

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:11.878
NOTED AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.980
DEFINITELY NO EASY SOLUTION TO

01:59:14.046 --> 01:59:15.181
THIS HOUSING CRISIS IT'S NOT

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:16.549
GONNA BE FIXED WITH IT FIX WITH

A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS THE

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:19.752
GOOD NEWS FOR THIS YEAR IS WE

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:20.987
HAVE LAST YEAR BOTH ARE FOUR

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.588
BILLION DOLLAR OVERALL HOUSING

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:23.656
BOND THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.030
WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:32.632
TO HELP THEM WITH HOUSING WE

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:33.799
ALSO HAVE THE ONGOING SOURCE

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:34.867
OF FUNDING FROM REAL ESTATE

01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:36.369
TRANSACTIONS THAT WAS APPROVED

01:59:36.435 --> 01:59:37.937
TWO YEARS AGO SO WE'RE HOPING

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:39.539
THAT OUR FUNDING LAYERED ON

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:40.640
TOP OF THOSE WILL START TO

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.475
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE SECOND

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:43.476
THING AND YOU MAKE A REALLY

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:45.044
GOOD POINT HERE ABOUT MAKING

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:46.679
SURE THAT WE REWARD EFFORTS

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:47.813
THAT ARE REDUCING THE COST

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.248
PER UNIT AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:50.850
THESE UNITS ARE BUILT QUICKLY

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:51.884
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

01:59:51.951 --> 01:59:53.452
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:54.487
ABOUT HOW TO GET THE BEST

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.522
IDEAS INTO OUR POLICY BUT IT'S

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:57.990
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT NOT ALL

01:59:58.057 --> 01:59:59.659
OF OUR HOUSING POLICIES IN THIS

01:59:59.725 --> 02:00:01.027
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE KNOW THAT

OF TAX CREDITS FOR HOUSING --

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:14.607
WHEN THOSE CREDITS ARE AWARDED

02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:16.909
AND WHO GETS WHAT MONEY IN WINE

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:17.977
THOSE CAN ALL BE A FUNCTION

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:18.978
OF SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WERE

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:20.746
TRYING TO REFINE RIGHT NOW AND

02:00:20.813 --> 02:00:22.014

TAX CREDIT THAT THEY GENERALLY

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:26.452

02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:04.910
A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THE

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.912

WE'RE STILL THE BOTTOM TEN

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:46.605

THIS ON PRIOR YEARS YEAH BUT

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:00.519
THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT WILL

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:01.854

FLOW PROBLEMS AND BUDGETARY

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:10.262
ISSUES I WANTED TO TO WRITE

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:11.030
SOMETHING THAT IN HERE YOU

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:13.399
SAY IS THAT THE POTENTIAL WITH

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:14.633
THE ENROLLMENT AND DECLINING

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.669
ENROLLMENT THAT WITH WITH THAT

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:18.737
CURRENT CURRENT YEAR REVENUES

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:20.572
COMING IN AND PROJECTIONS AND

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:23.242
AND THAT POTENTIALLY THE NAY

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:25.911
REVISED -- -- ALLOCATION FOR

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:27.846
OUR SCHOOLS COULD BE WHERE

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:30.816
AT POTENTIALLY LOWER YES SURE

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.651
-- SO THERE IT IS POSSIBLE

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:33.786
THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:35.621
EIGHT GUARANTEE WILL DECLINE

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.156
-- ONCE WE HIT MAY IN PART

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:40.759
BECAUSE OF -- LOWER REVENUES

02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:42.328
THE OTHER ISSUE HAPPENING

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.562
WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:44.897
EIGHT GUARANTEE IS THAT THERE

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.832
ARE SOME COSTS THAT LIKELY

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.133
WILL NEED TO BE INCORPORATED

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.301
INTO THE GUARANTEE IN MAY

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.569
THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.371
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THE AMOUNT

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:53.872
OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:56.308
SOMETHING LIKE THE LCF OF COLA

02:06:56.375 --> 02:07:00.346
LIKELY WILL BE SMALLER AND MAY

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.613
YES IT'S -- AGAIN THE BIG

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.982
PICTURE WHAT ARE FINANCE

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:04.950
RECTOR WAS TALKING TO MR

GREAT NEWS OVERALL LAST FEW

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:09.989
YEARS AND POSITIVE NEWS IN

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:11.991
THE JANUARY BUDGET IT'S STILL

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:13.826
HAS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:14.994
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.229
CALIFORNIA -- I WANTED TO TO

02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:18.764
TALK NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE THE

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:20.132
HIGHER ED REALLY A PROPOSAL

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:22.234
SO THE ELEMENTS OF THEM PARK

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:24.503
OUR CARS ARE SOLID CERTAINLY

02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:26.739
OUR JOB TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:28.574
AND THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE ON

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.309
ON ALWAYS A MINUTE MENTION IS

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:32.878
ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:37.883
UC AND CSU -- PROPOSALS --

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:38.917
HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS

02:07:38.984 --> 02:07:40.219
OVER FIVE ZILLION COMBINED

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:42.354
FOR FOR THE TWO BUT FOR FOR

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:43.422
EXAMPLE FOR THE UNIVERSITY

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:45.057
OF CALIFORNIA AT NOT ONE

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:46.725
ADDITIONAL SLOT FOR CALIFORNIA

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:48.794
KIDS TO GO TO UC I KNOW THE

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:50.729
BUDGET HAS MONEY THAT FUNDS

02:07:50.796 --> 02:07:53.232
PRIOR YEAR -- AGREEMENTS BUT

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:55.534
NO ADDITIONAL ACCESS AND THOSE

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:56.602
ARE THE ISSUES ARE CONSTITUENTS

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:59.204
ASK US ABOUT THAT CSU YOU

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:01.106
KNOW WE HAVE I THINK ELEVEN

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:03.876
THOUSAND SLOTS BUT THERE'S

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.644
THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED

02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:07.413
CSU APPLICANTS THAT HE DID

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:08.981
THAT DON'T GET ACCESS EVERY

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:10.783
YEAR SO THOSE ARE SOME ISSUES

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:12.284
WILL BE TRYING TO WORK WITH

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:14.253
THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON THE

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:15.821
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:18.223
VERY -- PLEASED TO SEE THAT

02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:20.492
FOR FREE FOR A YEAR TO IN THERE

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:22.561
FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE

02:08:22.628 --> 02:08:23.796
KIND OF TWEAK THAT WE WANTED

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:25.798
TO TO PUT ON THE TABLE IS

02:08:25.864 --> 02:08:28.500
THERE ARE -- FULL TIME STUDENTS

02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:29.835
WHICH BE NOT THE FIRST TIME

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:30.903
BUT BUT ALL IMPROVEMENTS IS

02:08:30.969 --> 02:08:32.304
OUR FIRST TIME FOR EXAMPLE YOU

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:33.605
COULD GO MANY COMMITTEE CALL

02:08:33.672 --> 02:08:35.374
STUDENTS NOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:36.642
THE GRACE EXPERIENCE WHEN THERE

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.477
ARE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN THEY

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.279
GO WORK FOR A FEW YEARS MAYBE

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:42.147
THEY'LL HAVE LESS THAN SIX OR

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:43.816
TEN UNITS UNDER THEIR BELT AND

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.517
THEY GO BACK IN A ROLE FULL

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:47.486
TIME TECHNICALLY THEY'RE NOT

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:50.289
FULL TIME FIRST TIME SO THAT'S

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:51.824
AN ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO TO

PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CUT -- AND

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.875
SOME OF THE FUNDING HAS NOT

02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:52.077
BEEN RESTORED -- I THINK A

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:55.547
PARTICULAR AROUND -- -- WITH

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:56.949

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:03.889
BACK TO PROVIDERS BUT THERE

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:05.290
THERE'S THINGS LIKE NON MEDICAL

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:07.559
-- TRANSPORTATION THAT HASN'T

AS WELL SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.868
IS YOU KNOW IS THAT SOMETHING

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.036
THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN

02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:19.972
TO LOOKING AT IN THE FUTURE

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:22.307
-- AND I SEE WE HAVE SOMEONE

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:23.208
HERE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:25.777
THAT -- BUT -- AND THAT'S SO

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:26.845
LET HIM ANSWER THE QUESTION

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:28.113
I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.417
SALTERTON OVER THAT IT WAS

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:33.719

02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:35.654
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:36.888
TIME SO I THINK THAT THE MOST

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.690
COMMON YOU KNOW -- ISSUE THAT

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:39.658

SEVEN -- THE RECESSIONARY

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.232
REDUCTIONS AND SO THE WAY THAT

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:48.700
THOSE REDUCTIONS WORK IS THAT

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.068
THEY WERE REDUCTIONS OF UP TO

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:52.271
TEN PERCENT MEETING THAT -- THE

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:53.839
ADMINISTRATION CAN EVALUATE IF

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:55.440
THERE WERE ACCESS CONCERNS WE

02:11:55.507 --> 02:11:56.808
CAN REDUCE THE SIZE OF THOSE

02:11:56.875 --> 02:11:58.810
REDUCTIONS OR -- CHOOSES STOP

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.078
IMPLEMENTING THEM IF THERE WAS

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.346
DEMONSTRATED ACCESS CONCERNS

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:02.914
IN FOR OVER TWO THIRDS OF

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.149
THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE EITHER

02:12:04.216 --> 02:12:05.884
BEEN ELIMINATED BY LEGISLATIVE

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:08.787
ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:10.489
WHEN -- THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:11.923
THAT THERE WAS AN ACCESS

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:13.759
PROBLEM AND THIS BUDGET -- DOES

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:16.128
A LOT TO INCREASE PROVIDER --

02:12:16.194 --> 02:12:17.829
-- PAYMENTS THROUGH PROPOSITION

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:20.098
FIFTY SIX AND SO -- CERTAIN

02:12:20.165 --> 02:12:21.533
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.668
WE'VE COME OUT OF THE RECESSION

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:24.102
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK IN

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.404
THIS AREA TO TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:28.040
CONCERNS ARE STILL A FEW THINGS

02:12:28.106 --> 02:12:30.142
HAVE NEVER BEEN RESTORED SO

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.510
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:32.711
IS THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:33.879
LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS IN THE

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:36.715
IN THE PAST THAT THAT HASN'T

02:12:36.782 --> 02:12:37.883
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE

02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:39.518
HAVE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP US

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.420
IN THAT REGARD ALWAYS ALWAYS

02:12:41.486 --> 02:12:43.088
-- OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.389
AS WE HAD WHEN WE RUN DOWN

02:12:44.456 --> 02:12:45.257
SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN THE

02:12:45.324 --> 02:12:47.125
PAST TWO LEGISLATIVE ACTION

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:49.461

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:50.896
US THERE'S ACCESS CONCERNS WE

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:51.930
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE SO

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.665
THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THOSE AS

02:12:53.732 --> 02:12:57.703
WELL -- JUST -- YOU KNOW ON --

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:59.471
LAST WEEK -- THE CUT BECAUSE

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:00.772
OUR FAMILY FOUNDATION RELEASED

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:02.908
A POLL THAT LOOKED AT ISSUES

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:04.443
THAT THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:13:04.509 --> 02:13:06.311
WANT THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:07.646
GOVERNMENT SALUTE TO WORK ON

02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:10.182
AND AND AND IN ORDER OF OF

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:12.184
THAT WERE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE

02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:14.186
AND HOUSING AND SO SO I GUESS

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:15.554
THAT I WANTED KUDOS TO THE

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.822
ORDER -- THE MINISTRATION FOR

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:17.923
THEIR PROPOSALS AND WE LOOK

02:13:17.989 --> 02:13:19.124
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:20.692
ADMINISTRATION I WOULD ADD

02:13:20.759 --> 02:13:22.027
THAT -- ONE OF THE THINGS

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:23.462
THAT THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:25.630
SEE MORE AND MORE OF AS WE

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.999
HAVE IT IT ACTUALLY A VERY

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:30.001
APPROPRIATE EMPHASIS ON EARLY

02:13:30.068 --> 02:13:32.070
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND AND

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:33.138
AND GETTING PEOPLE OFF TO GOOD

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:35.941
START MANY PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT

02:13:36.007 --> 02:13:38.477
OUR SENIORS -- -- HAVE HAVE

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:41.046
NOT SEEN THE EMPHASIS THERE

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:42.414
THAT THAT THAT WE ARE THAT

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.815
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.951
THEY THEY THEY SHOULD HAVE AND

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.319
THERE ARE MANY SENIORS WHO ARE

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:50.122
ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:52.491
-- BECAUSE OF SOME SOME

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:54.159
FEDERAL POLICIES AND AND EVEN

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:56.628
STATE POLICIES THAT THAT THAT

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:58.163
HAVEN'T BEEN PREVIOUSLY ON

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.197
THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS AND

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:00.599
SO AS WE LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:02.334
AND WE LOOK AT HOUSING WE

02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:03.735
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT ARE

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.203
VULNERABLE SENIOR POPULATION

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:07.606
AS WELL BECAUSE IT THEY THEY

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:09.007
ARE NOT AS THEY ARE NOT AS

02:14:09.074 --> 02:14:10.942
VOCAL THEY ARE NOT AS MOBILE

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:13.278
OFTENTIMES AND BUT AND AND WE

02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:14.579
SHOULD NOT HIDE WE SHOULD NOT

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:16.248
IGNORE THAT AND I HOPE THAT

02:14:16.314 --> 02:14:18.884
WHO GOING FOR WE CAN HAVE THE

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:20.318
ANY KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF THAT AS

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:23.255
WELL AND THEN FINALLY -- AS WE

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:25.690
LOOK AT -- -- IN THAT IN THE

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:27.459
KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION COLE

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:29.127
WAS VERY INTERESTING -- VERY

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:30.629
INTERESTING CYSTATIN STICKS IN

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:31.863
THE MATTER HOW YOU READ THIS

02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:33.932
BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT -- AND

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:35.167
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY EXACT

02:14:35.233 --> 02:14:36.835
CATEGORIES BUT YOU PUT THE

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.470
TOP TWO CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:40.472
CONCERNED ABOUT TOPIC TOGETHER

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:41.840
YET EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:43.475
PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:45.343
INTERESTED IN MENTAL HEALTH

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:47.179
AND AVAILABILITY OF ACCESS TO

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:49.014
PROVIDERS AND AND ACCESS TO

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.849
SERVICES AND SO AS WE LOOK AT

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.417
HOUSING AND THE CHRONICALLY

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:54.686
HOMELESS -- IS REALLY CRITICAL

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:56.188
THE WE LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH MY

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:58.056
MY OPINION MENTAL HEALTH PM THE

02:14:58.123 --> 02:14:59.991
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES SO THAT

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.359
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:03.595
CHALLENGES CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE

02:15:03.662 --> 02:15:04.830
THE HOUSING THAT WE HOPE

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:07.365
HOPE TO CREATE AND SO -- THAT

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:09.100
MENTAL HEALTH PICK PEACE HAS

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:11.303
BEEN HAS SOME SOMEWHAT VACCINE

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:12.771
-- BUT THERE IS A HUGE NEED

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:14.873
RECOGNIZED BY A HUGE NUMBER OF

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.708
CALIFORNIANS AND I HOPE THAT

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:17.876
I HOPE WE CAN WORK OUR WORK

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:18.977
ON THOSE ISSUES GOING FORWARD

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.512
SO AND ONE LAST POINT ON THAT

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:21.546
MENTAL HEALTH IN ADDITION

02:15:21.613 --> 02:15:22.681
TO THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN

02:15:22.747 --> 02:15:24.683
THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:26.184
COMMITTED TO APPOINTING A VERY

02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:28.320
HIGH LEVEL ADVISER TO HIM AND

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:29.688
HIS ADMINISTRATION ON MENTAL

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:31.389
HEALTH SOMEONE WHO IS KNOWN

02:15:31.456 --> 02:15:32.991
NATIONALLY AND SO I THINK WE'LL

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:34.159
ALL BE WARNING WHO THAT PERSON

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:35.427
IS VERY SOON BUT I THINK IT'S

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:37.062
SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ADVANCE

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:38.530
THE AGENDA AND PRIORITIES THAT

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:40.365
YOU DESCRIBED BECAUSE ONE POINT

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:41.533
THAT YOU MAKE WHICH IS SO TRUE

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.134
IS FOR A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:44.336
HIGH HOUSING HOMELESSNESS

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:45.303
WE ALL DRAW A PICTURE IN OUR

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:46.771
HEADS UP WHAT THAT PERSON WAS

02:15:46.838 --> 02:15:48.039
AFFECTED MAY LOOK LIKE BUT

02:15:48.106 --> 02:15:49.808
IN FACT ALWAYS AFFECTS A MUCH

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.243
WIDER SLICE OF THE POPULATION

02:15:51.309 --> 02:15:53.778
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:55.413
THANK YOU MISTER -- RUBIO THE

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:58.049
MYSTERON LOS THANK YOU MISTER

02:15:58.116 --> 02:16:00.385
CHAIR -- I WANT TO TALK A

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:01.820
LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- DISCUSSION

02:16:01.887 --> 02:16:03.288
-- NEAR REGARDING THE

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:05.023
REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION OF

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.858
INMATES -- YOU MADE A COMMENT

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:08.426
ABOUT INCREASING FUNDING FOR

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.328
TIME TO SUPPORT THE TEACHERS

02:16:10.395 --> 02:16:12.330
-- TO HELP WITH THE LITERACY

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:13.899
OF THOSE INMATES BUT FROM

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:15.700
WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT A PART

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:17.068
OF THE ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:18.203
AND I THINK THIS IS THE MOST

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:19.371
CRITICAL ISSUE IS THE LACK OF

02:16:19.437 --> 02:16:21.640
STAFFING WITHIN THOSE THOSE

02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:23.742
EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS -- FROM

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:25.544
WHAT I UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:27.879
THERE'S -- ANYWHERE BETWEEN

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:29.748
TEN TO FIFTEEN INMATES PER

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:32.050
ONE TEACHER WHICH IS REALLY

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:33.151
PUTTING THOSE TEACHERS AND

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:35.487
DANGER BUT IT'S NOT JUST WITHIN

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:36.888
THE THE THE TEACHING IT'S ALSO

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:38.156
IN THE WITHIN THE STAFFING OF

02:16:38.223 --> 02:16:40.692
THE PRISONS AND SOUL -- I'VE

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:42.193
HEARD SCENARIOS FOR EXAMPLE

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.562
THAT SOME OF THE INMATES DON'T

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:46.164
GO TO THOSE CLASSES BECAUSE

02:16:46.231 --> 02:16:47.899
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE GENERAL

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:49.267
POPULATION THEY GET THREATENED

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:51.836
BY OTHER INMATES AND SO SO I

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:53.905
APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:55.707
-- INCREASING THE FUNDING FOR

02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:56.875
SUPPORT FOR THOSE TEACHERS

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:58.410
BUT I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE

02:16:58.476 --> 02:16:59.311
IS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.046
STAFFING TO SUPPORT THOSE

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:03.448
TEACHERS WALL THERE IN THOSE IN

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.183
THAT SETTING WITH THOSE INMATES

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:11.189
IS THERE ANY -- -- ANY -- LE

02:17:11.256 --> 02:17:13.024
I'VE ARE WE LOOKING INTO THE

02:17:13.091 --> 02:17:14.559
STAFFING RACIAL SO THAT WE CAN

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:15.694
SUPPORTERS TEACHERS BECAUSE

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.228
FIRST OF ALL IF THE TEACHERS

02:17:17.295 --> 02:17:19.464
ARE IN DANGER -- OBVIOUSLY

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:20.599
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO AN

02:17:20.665 --> 02:17:22.267
EFFECTIVE JOB BUT IF THEY'RE

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:23.735
BEING ATTACKED FOR EXAMPLE OR

02:17:23.802 --> 02:17:25.403
IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFFING

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:27.372
WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM TO

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.740
WHERE THE INMATES ARE NOT

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:29.874
GETTING TO THOSE CLASSES THIS

02:17:29.941 --> 02:17:32.177
MONEY IS GREAT BUT IF WE'RE

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:34.279
NOT ACTUALLY -- INCREASING THE

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:36.181
LITERACY OF THESE INMATES HOW

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:39.551
ARE WE GOING TO REHABILITATE

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:41.019
ABSOLUTELY I'LL MAKE ONE POINT

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:41.920
AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:44.656
COLLEAGUE AS WELL -- FOR THE

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:45.624
INITIATIVES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:46.958
COMMITTEE TO IN THIS BUDGET

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:49.294
THE ADDITIONAL MONEY A STEP FOR

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:50.428
STAFF AND FOR THESE PROGRAMS

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:51.630
BUT IT'S ALSO TO RECRUIT

02:17:51.696 --> 02:17:53.665
PEOPLE -- HE WE MIGHT NOT THINK

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:55.000
OF AS TRADITIONAL STAFF SO

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:56.234
OFTEN EVEN OTHER INMATES WHO

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.969
CAN SERVICE LITERACY COACHES

02:17:58.036 --> 02:17:59.037
THERE'S ANOTHER INITIATIVE

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:00.372
THAT I DIDN'T MENTION IN THE

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:02.073
SHORT PRESENTATION BUT IT'S

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.441
THROUGH CAL VOLUNTEERS TO

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.310
RECRUIT FORMERLY INCARCERATED

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:06.411
KEEP ALL WHO HAVE TURNED THEIR

02:18:06.478 --> 02:18:07.712
LIVES AROUND AND SERVE AS

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.180
MENTORS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:10.749
INCARCERATED SO THAT SOME OF

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:11.950
THE WAYS WE CAN LEVERAGE NEW

02:18:12.017 --> 02:18:13.385
MODELS BECAUSE WE NOW WITH

02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:14.753
STAFFING THERE'S ALWAYS SO MUCH

02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:16.488
MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO BUT ON

02:18:16.554 --> 02:18:17.756
THAT SHORTAGE THAT YOU DESCRIBE

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:20.592
ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:21.660
THANK YOU MADELINE CLEAN

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:22.761
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:24.329
WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT --

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:25.463
STANDARDIZED STOPPING LEVEL

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:26.931
LOOKS AT EACH INSTITUTION

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:28.133
EACH SECURITY LEVEL AND FOR

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:29.634
EACH TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND THE

02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:30.935
APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF STAFF

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:33.538
ARE ASSIGNED TO CATCH AREAS

02:18:33.605 --> 02:18:35.340
OR -- EDUCATION OR CAREER

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:36.875
TECHNICAL EDUCATION OR ANY TYPE

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.343
OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS OR

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:39.477
JUST IN THE GENERAL SECURITY

02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:41.446
SETTING -- SO AT THIS AT

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:42.414
THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.281
ANY ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:18:43.348 --> 02:18:46.251
PROPOSALS -- AT THIS TIME TO

02:18:46.317 --> 02:18:47.686
INCREASE OR CHANGE THE STAFFING

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:48.520
LEVELS THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:49.554
BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGH

02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:50.955
STEP THROUGH THE BLUEPRINT

02:18:51.022 --> 02:18:53.558
THROUGH STANDARD AYE STAFFING

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:54.592
LET ME JUST OUTSIDE THERE

02:18:54.659 --> 02:18:56.094
HAS BEEN NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:57.328
THE STAFFING LEVELS WITHIN

02:18:57.395 --> 02:18:59.564
THE PRISONS -- I WOULD HAVE

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:00.765
TO DO SOME FURTHER RESEARCH

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:01.933
ON THAT BUT AT THIS TIME WE

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.602
HAVE -- EACH CLASSROOM HAS

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:06.004
A SPECIFIC CAPACITY FOR EACH

02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:07.639
TEACHER AND WE DON'T EXCEED

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:10.108
THAT WE MONITOR -- MONTHLY

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:10.909
-- THROUGH THE DIFFERENT

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.744
TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:14.713
OFFERED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF

02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:16.514
A TEACHER IS UNAVAILABLE THAT

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:18.316
THE -- THERE THE NUMBER OF

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:19.718
STUDENTS DOESN'T EXCEED THAT

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.219
THE CORRECT SECURITY LEVELS

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:22.320
OKAY WELL THEN LET ME ASK THE

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:23.655
OTHER -- THE REVERSE QUESTION

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.390
DO YOU MONITOR HOW MANY OF

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.524
THOSE INMATES ARE ACTUALLY

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:27.759
ATTENDING BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO

02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:29.561
AN ISSUE SO WE MAY NOT EXCEED

02:19:29.627 --> 02:19:30.929
THE AMOUNT OF OF STUDENTS BUT

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:31.896
IF THEY'RE NOT ATTENDING AT

02:19:31.963 --> 02:19:33.998
ALL THEN WE'RE INVESTING MONEY

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:36.434
INTO EMPTY -- CLASSROOMS ARE

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:39.037
NOT THAT -- CAPACITY CLASSROOM

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:41.606
SO IS THERE ANY STUDY TO SEE

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:43.041
HOW MANY INMATES ARE ACTUALLY

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:44.309
ATTENDING BECAUSE OF THE GOAL

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:46.611
IS TO EDUCATE THESE INMATES AND

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:47.912
REHABILITATE THEM SO WHEN THEY

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:50.181
COME OUT -- INTO THE REGULAR

02:19:50.248 --> 02:19:51.816
POPULATION THAT THEY'RE THEY AT

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:52.951
LEAST HAVE THE READING SKILLS

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:54.319
THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER

02:19:54.385 --> 02:19:55.820
SO IS THERE -- ANY WAY OF

02:19:55.887 --> 02:19:57.889
TRACKING OR MONITORING -- TO

02:19:57.956 --> 02:19:58.957
MAKE SURE THAT THESE INMATES

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:00.225
ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT

02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:01.960
WE ARE SO SUPPOSEDLY PAYING

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:04.629
FOR YES SO THE US DEPARTMENT

02:20:04.696 --> 02:20:05.764
OF CORRECTIONS RIGHT RULED

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:07.499
REHABILITATION HAS A DASHBOARD

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.000
PROGRAM THAT LOOKS EVERY MONTH

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.902
AT EVERY INSTITUTION EVERY

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:13.304
TYPE OF -- REHABILITATION

02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:15.039
OR EDUCATION PROGRAM OFFERED

02:20:15.106 --> 02:20:16.741
IT LOOKS AT THE NUMBER OF

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:18.176
AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN EACH

02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:19.344
CLASS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:20.845
TEACHERS ASSIGNED TO THAT CLASS

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:22.013
AND THAT ALSO GOES BACK AND

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.282
IT LOOKS AT -- IN ARREARS EACH

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:26.151
MONTH HOW MANY -- STUDENTS OR

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:27.519
SANDERS ATTENDED THOSE CLASSES

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:29.287
TO LOOK AT PARTICIPATION RATES

02:20:29.354 --> 02:20:30.789
AND SO THEY ACTUALLY WILL

02:20:30.855 --> 02:20:32.457
LOOK AT THE DATA MONTHLY AND

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:33.758
IF THEY FIND AN ANOMALY IN

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:35.794
A CERTAIN AREA THAT SAY THEY

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.262
HAVE -- TO TEACHERS AND COULD

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:38.296
HANDLE EIGHTY STUDENTS IN

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:39.697
THAT CLASSROOM BUT ONLY TWENTY

02:20:39.764 --> 02:20:41.266
STUDENTS ATTENDED IT MAY HAVE

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:42.467
BEEN FOR SOME OTHER REASON

02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:43.701
THAN LACK OF PARTICIPATION

02:20:43.768 --> 02:20:45.570
LIKE A LOCK DOWN OR SOME OTHER

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:47.138
EVENT AT THE INSTITUTION THAT

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:48.439
WOULD PREVENT THE OFFENDERS

02:20:48.506 --> 02:20:50.642
FROM ATTENDING THE CLASS MIGHT

02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:52.410
MONTHLY TRACK OKAY -- IS THERE

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:54.479
A WAY TO TO ACT -- IS THAT

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:56.080
INFORMATION THAT -- ACCESS

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:57.248
ONLINE OR IS THERE A WAY THAT

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.583
WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION

02:20:58.650 --> 02:20:59.651
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ACCESS

02:20:59.717 --> 02:21:00.652
ONLINE BUT I WILL WORK WITH

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:01.820
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.720
DETERMINE IF THERE'S LIKE A

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:04.289
ROLLED UP SUMMARY BECAUSE IT'S

02:21:04.355 --> 02:21:05.690
LIKE SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:06.724
SPREADSHEET THAT WE CAN ROLL

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:08.259
IT UP BY INSTITUTION TO TRY AND

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:09.727
PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL

IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND TRY

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.735

THE ACCESS TO THAT DATA IS NOT

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.606

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:31.850
GO BACK AND LOOK TO THROUGH

02:21:31.916 --> 02:21:33.685
TWELVE HUNDRED PAGES THEN HOW

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:35.286
IS IT THAT THERE THAT -- THE

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:36.688
POWERS THAT BE ARE ACCESSING

02:21:42.727 --> 02:21:43.628
THEY CAN PROVIDE SOMETHING

02:21:43.695 --> 02:21:44.696
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO READ

02:21:44.762 --> 02:21:45.630
THAT HAS ALL THE DATA THAT YOU

02:21:45.697 --> 02:21:46.965
HAVE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN

02:21:47.031 --> 02:21:48.266

THE HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:53.598
-- I THINK LOOKING AT SOME OF

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:55.199
THE SUB POPULATIONS AS FAR AS

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.534

-- THOSE NUMBERS ARE PROBABLY

02:23:01.706 --> 02:23:02.740
THE SAME THROUGHOUT SOME OTHER

02:23:02.807 --> 02:23:04.542
COUNTIES IN THE AREA SO WE

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:05.777
START TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:07.912
WE TALK ABOUT CHILD POVERTY

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:09.047

SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS THERE A

02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:14.018
WAY AND IS THERE ANY MORE FOR

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:15.119
THEIR DIALOGUE THAT WE COULD

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:17.055
HAVE TO START TO FOCUS ON THE

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:19.023
HOMELESS USE SITUATION IN THE

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:20.959
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:22.226
THAT THERE'S SHELTERS AND

02:23:22.293 --> 02:23:24.429
EXPANDING SHELTERS SPECIFICALLY

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:25.930
TO THAT SUB POPULATION THAT'S

02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:28.199
THERE I BELIEVE THAT TAPPING

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:30.234
THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IS IS

02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:31.836
GREAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:32.904
IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO HAVE

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.372
SOME RESOLVES THE MEASUREMENTS

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:36.074
TO IT THAT CAN WE START TO

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:37.809
FOCUS ON THE SUBPOPULATIONS

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:39.644

I THINK THAT'S A WAY OF BEING

02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:48.252
PROACTIVE TO THAT SITUATION AND

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:49.454
I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND I WOULD

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.922
BE OPEN TO HAVE ANY FURTHER

CALIFORNIA BUT THE OTHER TWO

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:09.173
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL

TROUBLING IS MOST THE FOLKS

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:19.009
THAT INTO COMING BACK INTO THE

02:30:47.605 --> 02:30:48.739
THERE'S NO CONNECTION I HOPE

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:49.807
THE GOVERNOR LOOK INTO THAT

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:51.242

HAS COMMITTED TO SIX MONTHS

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:19.116
OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE THE SPLIT

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:21.018
BETWEEN TWO PARENTS OR OTHER

FAMILY CAREGIVERS IF IT'S

NOT A TWO PARENT FAMILY AND

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:24.855
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:25.889
DESIGN THAT IN A WAY THAT'S

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:27.157
BEST FOR THE CHILD THAT THE

02:34:27.224 --> 02:34:28.559
FAMILIES FUNDING LAST AS

02:34:28.626 --> 02:34:30.260
WELL AS ENABLING PEOPLE TO GO

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:31.629
BACK TO WORK AND NOT PUTTING

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:33.464
AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:35.099
EMPLOYERS AND THE LAST THING

02:34:35.165 --> 02:34:36.033
I'LL MENTION WHICH IS MAYBE

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.101
THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT WHICH

02:34:37.167 --> 02:34:38.702
YOU RAISED ABOUT EQUITY AND

02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:39.637
MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.639
DISPARITIES I THINK ONE OF THE

02:34:41.705 --> 02:34:42.873
THINGS THAT THIS TASK FORCE

02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.842
WILL DO IS START TO LOOK AT

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:45.876
SOME OF THE RESULTS SOMEONE

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:47.177
COMING FROM THE MOST RECENT

02:34:47.244 --> 02:34:48.912
PAY FAMILY WE BILL THAT WAS

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:50.180
ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.815
I BELIEVE TWO YEARS AGO OR

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:52.983
WANTED TO AFFECT TWO YEARS AGO

02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:55.152
WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.820
AND WHAT THAT BILL DID WAS IT

02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:58.789
INCREASE THE -- INCREASED PAID

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:00.257
FAMILY LEAVE ACCESS ACROSS BUT

02:35:00.324 --> 02:35:02.559
ESPECIALLY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS

02:35:02.626 --> 02:35:04.261
INCREASED REPLACEMENT RATE

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:06.430
SO SEEING HOW THAT IS GOING

02:35:06.497 --> 02:35:08.599
WHETHER TAKE UP IS INCREASING

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:10.200
AND HOW WE HAVE TO FUND THIS

02:35:10.267 --> 02:35:11.368
PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IF

02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:13.003
WE EXPANDED TO SIX MONTHS WE

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:15.139
CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE THAT

02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:16.473
REPLACEMENT RATE FOR THE LOWEST

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.742
WAGE WORKERS IS A BIG PRIORITY

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.044
AND MORE BROADLY WE WANT TO

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:21.478
MAKE SURE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE

02:35:21.545 --> 02:35:23.213
PROGRAMS IT DOESN'T DO MUCH

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.248
UNLESS PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
