WELCOME CENTER THE RUSSELL THANK YOU THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE AMENDMENTS. TO CLARIFY COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW WHICH I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE NEW SIGNS ARE SCREENED BY CALTRANS AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW AND THE STATE'S FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION OBLIGATIONS. THE AMENDMENT WILL CLARIFY THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT- RAISES AN OBJECTION THEN THE ADVERTISING DISPLAY MAY NOT BE A WRECKED IT IF THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT RAISE AN OBJECTION- WITHIN A TO BE AGREED UPON TIME OF ALONG WITH A WRITTEN JUSTIFICATION THEN THE ADVERTISEMENT DISPLAY IS PRESUMED TO BE DEEMED IN COMPLIANCE. AND MAY BE WRECKED. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE WILL EXTEND THE ARENA EXEMPTIONS IN THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ACT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR STADIUMS AND ARENAS TO PURSUE FLEXIBLE REVENUE STREAMS AND NOT RELY ON PUBLIC FUNDING THIS IS A MAJOR HISTORIC CHANGE IN FINANCING OF ARENAS AND STADIUMS- SEVERAL YEARS AGO. OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES DECIDED THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO BUILD THESE ARENAS AND STADIUMS AND SO THEY HAD TO FIND ALTERNATIVE FUNDING. THE ARENA EXEMPTION WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE- TO FUND THE- HELP FUND THE CONSTRUCTION ON THE OPERATIONS ON THESE ARE A VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL REGIONAL CENTERS STADIUMS CREATE THOUSANDS OF PERMANENT. AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS- CREATE GENERATE MILLIONS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THE STADIUMS IS ALSO PROVEN TO BE VITAL PARTNERS IN OTHER WAYS. AS GAMES WERE CANCELLED DURING THE PANDEMIC MOST ARENAS BECAME DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR THOSE OF FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND PP DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS THE VOTING CENTERS. IN MY DISTRICT DODGER STADIUM FOR INSTANCE TESTED MORE THAN ONE MILLION ANGELENOS FOR CORONAVIRUS AND BECAME ONE OF THE LARGEST COVERT NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATION SITES IN THE WORLD. OVER THE YEARS THE ARENA EXEMPTION WAS CLARIFIED AND EXTENDED TO GIVE TEAMS AN OPPORTUNITYTO CONTINUE THIS TYPE OF PROGRAMMING. THIRTY NO SB THIRTEEN OH NINE WILL EXTEND THE BENEFIT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FOR STADIUMS AND ARENAS THIS BILL WILL ALSO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR A MARKETING CONTRACT FROM THE CURRENT ONE YEAR. TO A GROUP OF A NUMBER OF DAYS TO BE AGREED UPON WHICH WERE MORE ACCURATELY. RB FLEX OUTDOOR. OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE SAFEGUARDS IN THE BILL TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF FEDERAL HIGHWAY DOLLARS AND ENSURE THAT ANY FUTURE ARENA DISPLAYS DON'T VIOLATE OR OF STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. IF THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES A NOTICE OF NON COMPLIANCE THE SIGN MUST COME DOWN. IN ADDITION ALL ARENA BILLBOARD DISPLAYS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEY ARE IN. AGAIN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MUCH APPROVED MUST APPROVE AND THESE ARE THE SAME ARE ENTITIES THAT REVIEW AND APPROVE NON ARENA BILLBOARDS SO THEY HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. ARENA OPERATORS ARE NOT GRANTED ON UNREGULATED PRIVILEGE THEY MUST COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND LOCAL APPROVALS. OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES A FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE FOR SPORTS ARENA BILLBOARDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OUTDOOR BILLBOARDS IN THE STATE. AND OF THOSE NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED OR DIGITAL SIGNS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NEW BILLBOARDS THAT COULD BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS LAW REPRESENTS LESS THAN 1% OF ALL OUTDOOR BILLBOARDS AND LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT. OF NEWER DIGITAL SIGNS THIS MASSIVE INDUSTRY WILL NOT BE DISRUPTED THESE ARENA BILLBOARDS CANNOT POSSIBLY DR EXISTING OPERATORS OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY AREN'T THAT MANY OF THEM. REGARDLESS I REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT JEOPARDIZE FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS. MADAM CHAIR TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN PERSON TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF BENNY TRAN THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF CORPORATE STRATEGY. ARE AT THE LOS ANGELES FOOTBALL CLUB AND MARK THIS ALL SETTLED THE CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER AT ATG. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR THE LAST ONE BEFORE WE GET TO YOUR- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE'RE GONNA ESTABLISH A QUORUM BY MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT. NEW PLEASE ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLEASE. SENATE ALLEN. SENATOR BAKER. CENTER CORTESE CORTESE PRESENT SENATOR DOLLY DOLLY PRESENT CENTER LEMOND. SENATOR MCGUIRE SENATOR MELENDEZ CENTER SKINNER SAID AND WORK. OKAY AND AS A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THANK YOU MEMBERS- SO NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- WE HAVE- MISTER BENNY TRAN FROM THE LOS ANGELES FOOTBALL CLUB AND BANC OF CALIFORNIA STADIUM- YOU MAY PROCEED PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MANY TRANS I AM AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES FOOTBALL CLUB. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF LAFC IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE. OUR COPAYS IT'S HOME GAMES AT BACK CALIFORNIA STADIUM IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. SINCE THE TIME OF OUR OPENING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THIS FULLY PRIVATELY FINANCED STADIUM HAS BECOME NOT ONLY THE HOME TO LEADING I'M LASTING. BUT IT HAS ALSO BECOME AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CENTER FOR THE REGION. ONE THAN FLOYD AND EMPLOYS THOUSANDS OF LOCAL WORKERS MANY OF THEM REPRESENTING LOCAL UNIONS. DURING THE HEAD OF THE CODEPENDENT MAKE WHEN MLS GAMES WERE CANCELLED THE STATE IT BECAME A DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR THOSE IN NEED OF FOOD P. P. S. AND SEVERAL ALSO HOSTED SEVERAL VACCINE DRIVES. WE ALSO DURING THE TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. BECAME AN EARLY VOTING CENTER. LIKE THE OTHER PROFESSIONAL STADIUMS AND ARENAS IN CALIFORNIA ARE TIED. TO THE COMMUNITY R. D. I BELIEVE IT WILL A RECOGNIZE OF THE VALUES OF THESE LARGE COMPLEXES. PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA THAT LED THE LEGISLATURE. TEN YEARS AGO THAT AUTHORIZED STADIUMS LIKE OURS. DIRECT TO OFFSITE BILLBOARDS TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL MARKING REVENUE. TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE STADIUMS. WHEN THIS AUTHORIZATION WAS GRANTED TO STADIUMS THE ADVERTISING WAS REQUIRED TO BE PART OF A ONE YEAR MARKING PLAN BETWEEN THE STADIUM. AND ADVERTISER. IT WAS BELIEVE. THIS WOULD PROVIDE STAYS WITH A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE BENEFIT. UNFORTUNATELY THE APPROACH OF MARKETING ADVERTISING HAS CHANGED. THE OWNERS OF THE BUSINESS SERVICES INCREASINGLY WANT SHORTER DURATION. MORE TARGETED MESSAGING WHICH A ONE YEAR LOW LONG MARKETING PLAN MAY NOT A COMEDY. STAVES ARE MISSING OUT ON MUCH NEEDED REVENUE. THE BILL CORRECT THAT SHORTCOMING BY ONLY REQUIRING WORKING PLANTS TO BE THIRTY DAYS IN LENGTH. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER AS WE ARE NEWLY NEW EARLY. AND FOR US AS A NEW TEAM AND STADIUM- IN IN CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES. WE ARE THE PATHWAY. TO BECOME PROFITABLE BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. IN ADDITION TO THAT DURING THE TWO YEARS THE PANDEMIC. SINCE WE RELY SOLELY ON REVENUE THAT IS BASED ON ATTENDANCE WE HAVE LOST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL TEAMS AND STADIUMS. AND URGENT I ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU TRAN. AND NEXT WE HAVE A SECOND LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES MARTHA'S OF SEVERAL FROM ATG. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M MARTHA SOCIO CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR EIGHTEEN. ATG IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN OH NINE AND WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR DORADO FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE. HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES AG IS THE WORLD'S LEADING SPORTS AND LIVE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY AGEE'S DEVELOPED WORLD CLASS VENUES LIKE CRYPTO DOT COM ARENA FORMALLY KNOWN AS STAPLES CENTER AS WELL AS MAJOR SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT SUCH AS ELLIE WHY. SB THIRTEEN OH NINE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF STADIUMS AND ARENAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHICH SERVE AS A MAJOR CATALYST FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GENERATED SUPPORTS THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS BOTH DURING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION. AND HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY SECTORS IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DRIVERS FOR THE STATE. FREEWAY VISIBLE SIGNAGE ON OR NEAR STADIUMS ARENAS AND SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICTS HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF NEW STADIUM AND ARENA PROJECTS. AND FOR RENOVATIONS OF THESE FACILITIES WITHOUT THE RELIEF OFFERED BY S. B. THIRTEEN OH NINE THE CURRENT PROVISIONS AT THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING AT. ARE LIKELY TO STIFLE FUTURE CONSTRUCTION. ALTHOUGH SB THIRTEEN OH NINE BROADENS THE REACH AND IMPACT OF THE ARENA EXEMPTION IT DOES NOT OPEN THE DOOR FOR A PROLIFERATION OF OUTDOOR SIGNAGE AROUND THE STATE AND ITS APPLICABILITY IS LIMITED ONLY TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS VENUES. CONCERNS BY COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SUCH LEGISLATION ON FEDERAL AID HIGHWAY FUNDING. NO ONE CERTAINLY NOT AG WANTS TO IMPACT FEDERAL AID HIGHWAY FUNDING WE ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF OFFERED TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS THEIR CONCERNS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE SB THIRTEEN OH NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY THAT CONCLUDES LEAD- TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. AND NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WHO'D LIKE TO SUPPORT S. B. NOT. EXCUSE ME SB THIRTEEN OH NINE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANGIE MINUTE HERE IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES DODGERS THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN TO NINE HUNDRED GOVERNOR IN HALF THE SAN FRANCISCO FORTY NINERS WE APOLOGIZE WE DO NOT GET OUR LETTER OF SUPPORT IN TIME BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF THE OATH OAKLAND ATHLETICS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN THE GALERY IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN OH NINE. RIGHT SEE NONE SO MODERATE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE AND FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN OH NINE PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN OH NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS THE ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU AREN'T SUPPORT AT THE. THIRTEEN OH NINE. AND MENTOR WE HAVE KNOWING TUNE UP AT THIS TIME FOR SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU- NOW WILL TURN IT TO LEAD OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OF BOTH HERE IN PERSON THE FIRST AS MEGAN LOPER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION- IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP AND TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN OH NINE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS REMEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MEGHAN LOW FOR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION. HOW WE REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SB THIRTEEN OH NINE AND DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS. ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A REVIEW THAT LANGUAGE BUT AT FROM THE DISCUSSION HERE IT SOUNDS LIKE. HAD THEY TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO LOOK AT FEDERAL COMPLIANCE FOR FUTURE SIGNS BUT WE REMAIN CONCERNED WITH SIGNS THAT ARE EXISTING. THAT HAVE FEDERAL VIOLATIONS AND THE CSAA HAS REPRESENTED LICENSE OUTDOOR ADVERTISERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AND OUR MEMBERS DO REPRESENT BOTH SMALL FAMILY OWNED INDEPENDENT OPERATORS AND LARGER NATIONAL COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS HERE IN THE STATE. OUR MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTS ABOUT 90% OF THE BILLBOARD FACES THAT YOU SEE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SIGNS AND THE- BIG QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. THIS MEANS THAT ARENA SIGNS- REALLY POSE A THREAT RESPECTFULLY WE WOULD- SUBMIT THAT THEY DO GIVEN THAT ARENA SIGNS ARE OPERATING IN MANY CASES AT SIZES THAT ARE BEYOND WHAT IS ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER CROSS PROMOTIONAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES THAT GIVES ADVERTISERS A RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT A SINGLE SIGN. I'M ON MY WAY CAN OFFER. I WE LOOK FORWARD TO TAKE. TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS- BUT APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE THREATS TO FEDERAL FUNDING WE DO FEEL THAT THE MARKETING PLAN WHO WAS A RECOGNITION THAT ARENA SIGNS WERE RECEIVING SPECIAL TREATMENT AND BEING. ALLOWED TO BE ARRESTED IN OP AND PLACES THAT ARE AT LICENSE BILLBOARD OPERATORS WERE NOT ABLE TO SPEAK PERMITS FOR. AND WE DO FEEL THAT THAT MARKETING PLAN WAS AN ATTEMPT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND BY CHANGING. AND ELIMINATING THAT DOWN TO THIRTY DAYS THAT PUTS THESE FINES IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP. AT RESPECTFULLY WE MUST AT THIS TIME REMAIN OPPOSED AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS LOPER. I NEXT OUR OUR LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS NUMBER TWO IS MISTER STEVE CRUZ WITH OF THE ALLEY OF DORE MR CRUISE YOU MAY BEGIN YEAH. A GOOD MORNING MENTION MEMBER STEVE RUZ AND I REPRESENT A NUMBER OF THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED- BILLBOARD COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE SLOPER- GET PRETTY THE COMMENTS BY- THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZING COUPLE ISSUES WHICH IS ONE- THE UNFAIRNESS AND HEAR AN UNFAIRNESS OF. THE DYNAMICS THAT YOU CREATE AND APPROVING WHAT WE CALL THESE ONE UP BILLBOARD EXEMPTIONS- AND THE REALITY IS THE SMALL COMPANIES HAVE ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY CODE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES INDUSTRIES. AND SO WE'RE COMPETING FOR THAT SAME FINITE NUMBER OF ADVERTISING REVENUES AND IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO BE ON THE SITE LOCATED PROBABLY ON A FREEWAY AND IT'S TEN TIMES LARGER THAN THE ONE. SIX BLOCKS IN THAT'S UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND SO- I THINK THAT'S OUR PRIMARY CONCERN ALSO WHEN THEY'RE READING EXEMPTION WAS APPROVED IT WAS APPROVED AT IT WAS A TEMPORARY IN NATURE RIGHT TO ASSIST IN THE FINANCE OF THE STADIUM. AND THE PROPONENTS COME BACK IN ONE EXTEND THAT SO IN OUR MIND IF YOU DO IT FOR THIS BILL YOU'LL HAVE TEN MORE THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR AND IT MAY NOT BE FOR THE RETAIL. BEFORE SOME OTHER EXEMPTIONS OUT. WE HAVE RELEASED TO HOLD THE- BECAUSE WE PLAY BY THE RULES WE THINK OTHERS PLAY BY THE RULES AND SO. UNFAIR A PLANE FIELD I THINK IS A ISSUE I- THAT WE HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER I THINK THE OTHER IS ON THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY- DOLLARS AT RISK AGAIN THAT'S A REAL ISSUE THERE'S BEEN- COMMUNICATION FROM FHWA IN THAT REGARD. AND SO RECEIVE THEM AND IF THEY WERE SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE- WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THAT PROPONENTS BUT AGAIN WITH THIS POINT WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU MR CRUISE SO IF CONCLUDED EARLY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTY NINE SO WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE GALLERY ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY WOULD LIKE TO- TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. TO SB THIRTEEN OH NINE PLEASE. C. NINE MODERATOR WILL TAKE IT BACK TO YOU TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN OH NINE PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION UP AT THE THIRTEEN OH NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE. THEN ZERO. AGAIN AT ONE NINE ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION SB. THIRTEEN OH NINE. AND I'M SURE WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO IT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL TAKE THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MANAGER I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE AUTHOR- FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENT AND THE AMENDMENT IS JUST FOR CD. JUST MINUTES AGO OBVIOUSLY ADDRESSES THE FEDERAL VIOLATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FACT IS THAT- IT'S BEEN STATED THAT IF THERE IS ANY VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT OR THE DISPLAY. OF THE APPARATUS WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THE BILLBOARD ITSELF WILL BE REMOVED. AND CONSEQUENTLY REMOVING ANY CHALLENGE- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- WOULD NOT AFFECT OURSELVES IN THE STATE. IN VIOLATION AS WELL OR THE CITIES AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMPLIMENT THE FACT THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- TO- LOOK AGAIN AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT STILL MIGHT REMAIN. WHICH PERTAIN TO DISTANCE THE ADVERTISEMENT OF CERTAIN ITEMS WITHIN THE STADIUM OUTSIDE THE STADIUM SO I HOPE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THIS IS WHY I'M IN A- AGREED TO MOVE THE BILL- UNDER COMMITTEE SO YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING. WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SEVEN ARCHULETA ANYMORE. A MEMBERS OF CENTER RUBIO. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU KNOW I ALSO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND- YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I WANTED KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE RINOS HAVE DONE. DURING THE COVER TIMES UNITED IT WAS ALREADY EXPRESSED YEAR- I KNOW THAT THEY BECAME- CENTERS FOR VACCINATION SITES AND THEY PROVIDED A LOT OF BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS COMMENDABLE- BUT I CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ON THIS BILL AND PERHAPS COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I HAD. EMAILED A NEGOTIATED SEVERAL LOCAL CONTRACTS ON WITH BILLBOARDS AND I DO KNOW- BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW IT DOES POSE A SOMEWHAT OF A UNFAIR. COMPETITION ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE RIGHT BEFORE ME IT SAYS THE ARENA EXTENSION WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED TO HELP. FUND NEW SPORTS ARENAS BOTH CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS IS SAYS THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE BILLBOARD ADVERTISING REVENUES OF THESE ALREADY SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATIONS HOWEVER THIS NEW REVENUE COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TRADITIONAL OUTDOOR ADVERTISING COMPANIES. AND THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO JUST STATE THAT THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AND SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT ADVANTAGE THAT WILL BE PLACED AND DISADVANTAGED TO SMALLER- BILLBOARD. COMPANIES AND I KNOW THAT THE INTENT IS THERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE. I MEAN THE REALITY IS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GOING TO DODGER GAMES SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND I YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL EVEN BEFORE BILLBOARDS YOU KNOW THE BIG. BRIGHT ONES THAT WE SEE NOW AND FREEWAYS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND FOR ME AS I WANT THIS CONVERSATION TO IS. TO SOMEHOW INCLUDE THOSE SMALLER BILLBOARDS RIGHT NOW I'M JUST BASED ON THE FIRST- SUPPORTER I'M SORRY YOUR LEAD WITNESS YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT HE SAID THIS BILL WILL HELP. GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES STADIUMS ARE MISSING OUT ON SIGNIFICANT REVENUES WE ARE NOT PATHWAY TO BECOME PROFITABLE- BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND STILL THE CONVERSATION REVOLVES. A LOT AROUND PROFITABILITY AND I THINK THAT. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GOOD PAYING JOBS BECAUSE THEY NEED TO THEIR LARGE INSTITUTIONS THAT RELY ON GOOD PAYING JOBS TO KEEP THAT NEED A STADIUM COINED THE WORKFORCE WILL BE THERE THE PROFITS WILL BE THERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW MUCH. MY PERSONAL CONCERN IS I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I NEED MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT SMALLER COMPANIES WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT. AT A DISADVANTAGE AND I DO BELIEVE THIS IS UNFAIR COMPETITION. I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO LAY OFF BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO HEARING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE SMALLER COMPANIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND I THINK A SENATOR THAT ALSO CAN EXPLAIN IN HER CLOTHES AND SO SENATOR AKOWSKI NEXT THANK YOU MANAGER- I'M- THE OPPOSITION RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT SIGNS THAT MAY BE OUT OF FEDERAL COMPLIANCE. BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS THAT I HAVE TALKED TO BE ABLE TO CALTRANS WE WILL SAY NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN USING THE CRITERIA OF WHETHER IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET TWO CLICK LOCATED TO CLOSE IT ANOTHER SIGN OR ON DISPLAY IN FULL MOTION PICTURES AS A SORT OF A IDEAS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT SO IT'S PRETTY ESY TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OR TO CLOSE WE'RE RE AUTHORIZING THE EXPIRED SPECIAL PROVISIONS THIS THE AUTHOR THINKS. THAT THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND THE OTHER DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL POWERS SAID WE'RE GIVING TO THE CALTRANS WITH THIS AMENDMENT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO. ENFORCE ANY PERCEIVED VIOLATIONS CURRENTLY AND SIGNS THAT ALREADY EXIST. THANK YOU CENTER AKOWSKI AND I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION SOCIETY RATHER DO IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT NOW- WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE. I THINK IN MY CLOTHES I COULD PUT BUT BECAUSE OKAY AND THEN. THE OTHER QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD USE THAT- AFTER THIS ANSWER RECTITUDE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT I GET. THE TWELVE HUNDRED FEET YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH TOO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BUT THEN DISPLAYING FULL MOTION PICTURES EVEN THOUGH. IT'S ONLY 5% OF THE SIGNS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THESE VIDEO THINGS HOW DO HOW THIS CALTRANS POLICE IF SOME. PERSON WAS DOING MOTION PICTURE WHEN YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO DO STILL ADDS WITH REGARD TO FEDERAL LIFE GETS ITS IT'S IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW BUT HOW WOULD WE ENFORCE. THAT PROVISION OR IS. AGAIN THIS DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL ANOTHER FOR THEM TO GO NGUYEN POSTER ACTION AND REMEDY YET. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI AT SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO COMPLEMENT THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS TRYING TO BRING THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER IN ENSURE THERE'S FAIR NOW SPENT. I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR RUBIO I THINK THAT THEY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE- IS REALLY VERY COMPELLING ARE TO OFFER ME TO CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THAT WITH THE HOPES THAT AS IT GOES FORWARD. I YOU'LL REALLY BE ADDRESSING THAT AND CERTAINLY THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY SENATOR WIECKOWSKI THOSE ARE ALL OF THE COMPELLING NATURE. IN TERMS OF SETTING A PRECEDENT I EVEN THOUGH IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TERM THESE THINGS CONTINUE AND CONTINUE AND ARE CERTAINLY I'M CONCERNED IT DRIVES OUR TRADITIONAL. FOLKS OUT OF BUSINESS SO- I WILL REMAIN OPPOSED TODAY BUT WITH THE HOPES THAT WHEN IT REACHES. THE FLOOR THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE- AT THAT POINT IN TIME A COMPROMISE THAT WORKS FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES CENTER MELENDEZ. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON THE FLOOR WE- ASSUME THAT THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE FORMALITIES ARE LIKE WHEN WE ARE IN SESSION BUT WEARING COMMITTEE AND SO THE QUESTION IS BEING ASKED OF THE OTHER IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE ANSWERED AT THE TIME THEIR ASSET MAY PRECIPITATE EVEN MORE QUESTIOS I WOULD JUST ASK THAT- SENATOR DORADO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS IT'S IN A WHITE CAL SKI ASK BECAUSE- THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS MIGHT LEAD TO MORE SO THAT WE CAN PROPERLY VET THIS BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MELENDEZ SENATOR ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. AND I CAN ALSO- CLARIFY SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS JUST I THINK EVERYONE HAS THE AMENDMENTS ON THEIR DESK A PROVIDED BAR CHIEF CONSULTANT. BUT THE PROPOSED WHAT THE BILL DOES AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THREE THINGS TWO OF THEM ARE UNCHANGED AT THE HIP AND HAD BEEN DEBATED. THE FIRST ENSURES THAT FUTURE ARENA BILLBOARDS ARE COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW BY REQUIRING CALTRANS PRE APPROVED IN IN AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF DAYS OF THAT IS GOING TO BE NEGOTIATED. WING FORWARD- EXTENDS ARENA SUNSET UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. IT REDUCES THE MINIMUM DURATION OF THE ARENA MARKETING PLAN TO THIRTY DAYS FROM ONE YEAR STILL BEING DISCUSSED- AND IN TERMS OF THE- CITY I BELIEVE SENATOR CASKEY MENTION THE- CALTRANS ENFORCEMENT ISSUE THERE. THERE THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUE. THIS IS OF COURSE NOT YOU KNOW NEW BILLBOARDS- BUT- THERE HAD BEEN VIOLATIONS IN THE PAST AND SO WE NEED TO- GET CLEARED I THINK MOVING FORWARD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE- ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WILL BE FOR CALTRANS MOVING FORWARD IF THIS BILL SHOULD PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE- BUT SENATOR RAZA WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION SURE I MEAN I THINK WITH REGARDS TO THE UNFAIR COMPETITION- AGAIN AND I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER- THE NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE SPREAD ALL OVER THE STATE. OF IS MASSIVE EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SCIENCE- WE'RE TALKING HERE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE AUTHORIZED BY BY THIS EXTENSION- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE- ARGUMENT. THAT IN THESE VERY LIMITED LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS GOING TO CREATE SUCH A DISADVANTAGE- THAT'S ONE THE SECOND THING IS I REMEMBER THAT THERE HAVE TO BE LOCAL APPROVALS ARE HAS TO BE LOCAL ORDINANCE. THAT THEY ALSO- HAVE TO GO FORWARD AND GET- BEFORE THEIR LOCAL ENTITIES. SO THEY HAVE TO THE ARENA BILL BOARDS ALSO HAVE TO GET THAT- THAT APPROVAL SO- THE NUMBERS TO SHOW THEY'RE NOT UNFAIR COMPETITION- THE WAY IN WHICH THEAPPROVALS HAVE TO BE DONE. SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE- WHAT ELSE TO SAY ABOUT THAT- WITH REGARDS TO ENFORCEMENT AS YOU SAID MADAM CHAIR- THIS IS. IN CALTRANS HANDS WE- THIS OF- EXTENSION OF THIS BILL DOES- OF THIS EXEMPTION. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE ENFORCEMENT THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OUT THERE THAT COULD BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WE DECIDED OKAY LET'S DEAL WITH IT MOVING FORWARD SO THAT'S HOW WE ADDRESS THAT- AND I. I DON'T KNOW WHICH OTHER QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL. SENATOR WILL GO TO SENATOR ALAN AND THEN COME BACK TO CENTER MELENDEZ SENATOR ALAN. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION- I YOU KNOW I HAVE LESS OF A PROBLEM CONCEPTUALLY OUT OF WITH THIS BILL IN THE SENSE I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT. AREAS AROUND STADIA- I DON'T THINK THAT THE TYPES O PLACES. WHERE I THIS BILL ENVISIONS ADDITIONAL ADVERTISING WITH THE KINDS OF PLACES THAT LADY BIRD JOHNSON HAD MINE WHEN SHE PUSHED THE LEGISLATION THE FIRST PLACE. I WILL SAY ONE THING THOUGH AND I DON'T AND I KNOW. THAT THE AMENDMENTS HELP A LITTLE BIT IN THIS PLACE BUT I DON'T THINK GO FAR ENOUGH. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. WERE ALREADY IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW- THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE TAKING ON A RISK HERE. ARE BY DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS SYSTEM ON ON THIS APPROACH. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A- UP A CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM WITH. THE APPROACH I YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE DRIVE AROUND DODGER STADIUM OR OR THE ONE TEN FREEWAY OR ANGEL STADIUM THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF. BEAUTIFUL GREEN WAY THE LABOR JOHNSON TRY TO PROTECT. IT SO I DON'T MIND IF THERE'S NEW MORE ADVERTISING RIGHT AROUND THAT STADIUM IT'S FINE TO ME BUT- I THINK THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE MAKING MONEY OFF OF THIS OUGHT TO BE HELPING TO. PAY THE STATE A LITTLE BIT TO HELP COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISK THAT WE'RE TAKING. ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOR OUR HOW ARE HIGHLY FUNDS BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMES TO US AND NOT TO THE FOLKS. WHO COULD BE VIOLATING THE LAW- ON THE GROUND AND I WANT TO BRING THAT UP AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS LIKE THE STATE'S NOT TAKING ON. THIS THERE'S NO UPSIDE TO THE STATE HERE IN SPITE OF THE BIG RISK THAT WE'RE TAKING ON AS WE CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN. ON THIS APPROACH. AND I LOVE YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE IF THE CHAIR THE AUTHOR HAVE COMMENTS ON THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO HEAR. WHAT IT ROUTE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE RISK IN A WAY THAT'S NOT BEEN ADDRESSED THERE HASN'T BEEN LANGUAGE THIS IS MUCH STRONGER LANGUAGE THAN WHAT EXISTS NOW AS FAR AS CALTRANS RESPONSIBILITIES WE'RE GIVING MORE TEETH TO THEM SAYING IF YOU GET A NOTICE. IF YOU GET A NOTICE FROM THE STATE AND- LET ME JUST BACK UP THERE IS NO THERE ARE BEEN NO SPECIFIC NOTICES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO AND BEEN BROUGHT TO ANYBODY'S ATTENTION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED SO AS FAR AS WITH. WE KNOW YOUR IT THEY AREN'T ANY GOING ANY SPECIFIC NOTICES BUT MOVING FORWARD IF US UP A NOTICE IS GIVEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO. TAKE IT DOWN THE CALTRANS HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE IT DOWN I MEAN THAT'S MORE POWER THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD- SO WE AGREED TO DO THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO PROOF THAT OR EVIDENCE THAT. BY PUTTING UP SOME MORE SIGNS THAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT THE SIGNS ARE ALL IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW WE'RE SAYING IS OKAY IF THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THAT LET'S ADDRESS IT LET'S GIVE MORE POWER TO CALTRANS AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE DOWN A DISPLAY IF THERE'S A NOTICE BEING GIVEN TO IF THERE'S A THREAT IF THEY THINK THERE'S A THREAT. OF LOSING FIVE OF FEDERAL FUNDS THEY CAN TAKE IT DOWN SO THERE'S A WAY TO CURE THE PROBLEM- IN A WAY THAT STRONGER THAN IS EVER UP THERE WE'VE EVER HAD AND WE SEE TAKE IT DOWN WHO PAYS FOR TAKING IT DOWN. THE AT ADVERTISER. SO THEY AND THEY CAN COMPEL. YES I CAN SAY CRIMINAL PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T DO IT WHAT WHAT'S THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY THEY'RE- THEY'RE TAKING DOWN THE SIGN. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN. I WOULD HAVE A DOMINO WHAT. IS WHAT WHAT'S THE MECHANISM I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT WAYS I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY WITH THE MECHANISMS FOR ENFORCEMENT AND WE DID IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE DON'T GET ANY MORE DETAIL ON THAT OTHER THAN TO GIVE VERY EXPLICIT DIRECTION THAT CALTRANS CAN ORDER THEM TO TAKE IT DOWN. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR RAWSON AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE THINK WITH- THE AUTHORS MENTIONING IS THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DEBATED- BUT- IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROVIDED TO YOU- INSURES THAT FUTURE RINA BILLBOARDS ARE COMPLIANT WITH STATE FEDERAL OTHER REQUIRING CLUB CALTRANS PRE APPROVED- IN AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF DAYS BUT- THE NUMBER OF DAYS IS ONLY WHAT. IS ADDRESSED IN THE BILL OR WILL BE ADDRESSED MOVING FORWARD NOT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BUT AGAIN SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DISCUSSED AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW AS WE'RE DEBATING THIS OF COURSE LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND OPINIONS ON THIS. WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY HAS ITS COMMITTEE TO BRING THIS THIS BILL BACK SHOULD WE HAVE MORE ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW MORE QUESTIONS AN ADDITIONAL- COMMENTS TO BE MADE ON THIS BUT- THAT IS- I TRUST THAT THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE. INROADS WITH BOTH SIDES SO WITH THAT SAID- SENATOR MELENDEZ WILL GO BACK TO YOU AND THEN WE'LL GO. TO SENATOR MEN. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO. A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU KNOW. WE HAVE BILLS TO COME THROUGH COMMITTEE AND IT IS VERY COMMON FOR THERE TO BE A FEW TWEAKS THAT NEED TO BE MADE A FEW ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT AREN'T MAJOR CHANGES BUT ARE RATHER MINOR CHANGES WERE DISSATISFIED- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. BUT IT IS INCUMBENT ON US AS LEGISLATORS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO PROPERLY VET THESE BILLS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT PASSING BILLS. THAT ARE FILLED WITH HOLES AND HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE CORE ISSUE THAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS WHAT I SEE. WITH THIS BILL IT IS PUSH BILLS FORWARD THAT WE KNOW. AREN'T READY WITH THE HOPES OF AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD IT WILL GET FIXED BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS- TOO OFTEN IS IT BECOMES A MESS. IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND THEN IT'S- I MEAN THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WAY. TO DO OUR JOBS HERE SO I THINK THIS BILL IS. IS NOT READY TO MOVE FOR YET THAT IS MY OPINION I WILL ADD ON. THOUGH THAT THE SMALLER TRADITIONAL OUTDOOR ADVERTISING COMPANIES- YOU KNOW AREN'T BEING GIVEN THE SAME ADVANTAGE. THAT YOU ARE GIVING THESE OTHERS IN YOUR BILL AND WE SEE THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. PARTICULARLY WITH- SPORTING ARENAS AND ATHLETIC TEAMS THAT THEY GET EXEMPTIONS THAT THE SMALLER GUYS JUST DON'T GET AND I JUST WONDER HOW LONG. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO GIVE A HAND OUT. TO THE ONE PERCENTERS THE BIG CORPORATIONS OUT THERE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SMALLER GUYS I THINK THERE IS A WAY- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITHOUT- YOU KNOW TRAMPLING. ON THE SMALLER GUYS SO WITH THAT- I'M SORRY I CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I THINK THERE'S- FAR TOO MANY- YOU KNOW I'M I'M- ISSUE IN THIS BILL. FOR US TO MOVE IT FOR IN THE HOPES. THAT IT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD A GETS PICKED YOU MANAGE. THANK YOU SENATOR MILLER. SENATOR MEN- QUESTION FOR THE OTHER. YES SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE SPEAR OF THE MEN THAT YOU'RE- TODAY. IS A CORRECT THAT YOU ARE. TO ADD THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUE FROM CINEMA REYES TO IS THAT- THIS. YOUR WHICH MAY STILL NEED TO BE FLESHED OUT A LITTLE BIT. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. PERMITTING NEW ADVERTISING THAT IS IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT ALL OF THE FEATHER ALL OF THE NEW ADVERTISING AROUND SPORTS ARENAS. THAT IS PERMITTED UNDER YOUR BILL WOULD BE COMPLIANT WITH FEDERAL LAW TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN HE HAS IS THAT KIND OF THE GOAL YOU DON'T IS THAT GONNA BE CONTINUE TO BE THE GOAL YOU'RE WORKING TOWARDS AS YOU CONTINUE TAKING MINUTES. YES THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THANK YOU AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I THINK. THAT ADDRESSES MY MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS BILL SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK TO. A PERFECTED ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCHFOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN AND SENATE ARCHULETA YES I'M- MANAGER EDWIN ADDITIONAL QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THE EXPANSION. OF THESE NEW BILLBOARDS WITH A GO BEYOND A MILE AND A HALF. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A- LIMIT. MY CONCERN IS TO GO TO FAR. IN ENCROACH INTO. THE OTHERS A SMALL- BILLBOARDS AND SO ON. RIGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS IT'S RIGHT. EXACTLY THE ARENA AND THEY WOULD ONLY ADVERTISE. THE PRODUCTS WITHIN THE ARENA. OR IS THE BILL TAKEN IT. OUTSIDE BEYOND. THAT SAY A MILE OR SO IT'S IN THE PERIPHERY OF THE ARENA. BUT NOT. EXCEEDING MAYBE A THOUSAND FEET RIGHT THOUSAND FEET IT DOESN'T EXCEED A THOUSAND FEET YEAH. THANK YOU. MANY THANK YOUS AND ARCHULETA WILL GO BACK TO SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA CLARIFICATION- WHAT MOM SENATOR ARE TO LARGEST PASSED. IS IT A THOUSAND FEET WITHIN THE ARENA I CAN YOU CLARIFY THERE'S A POP UP AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT A PARKING STRUCTURE OR- PARKING FOR THE ARENA CAN YOU CLARIFY IS IT FROM THE STADIUM. OR FROM THE PARKING IT'S FROM THE ANY PARKING FACILITY USED IN THE OPERATION OF THE ARENA. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ANY A PARKING USE IN THE OPERATION OF THE ARENA SO LET'S SAY POTENTIALLY THEY CAN. BUY A SECOND LOT SOMEWHERE ELSE TO ACCOMMODATE THE OVERFLOW TRAFFIC AND- AND PARKING OF THE ARENA DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY WILL USE THAT. TO QUALIFIED AS ONE THOUSAND FEET SO IT COULD BE. I DON'T KNOW LET'S SAY TWO THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE ARENA CANNOT BE MISUSED IN ANYWAY WELL WE TRIED OUR BEST A THOUSAND FEET FROM ANY PARKING FACILITY USED IN THE OPERATION OF THE ARENA. WE TRIED TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE IT'S AT THE ARENA PARKING FACILITY. AT THE ARENA. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL- IN I DO I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN I WANT TO BRING OUT- I. IT'S REALLY THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE OF FOR WHATEVER THAT'S WORTH BUT- I'M NOT. VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE COMPETITION ISSUE- ALSO HAVING BEEN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND SEEN SOME OF THE BATTLES TO. OF THE INDUSTRY JUST TO TRY TO GET A PRESENCE IN IN HIGH TRAFFIC HIGH PROFILE AREAS I'M NOT SURE WHY ANYBODY IN THIS INDUSTRY WOULD OPPOSE SOMEBODY ELSE. BREAKING THROUGH- TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE AN INDUSTRY THAT'S UNDER SIEGE AND YOU'D THINK EVERYONE WOULD. JUMP ABOARD SAY THE MORE THE MERRIER WE LIKE THIS KIND OF COMPETITION BECAUSE IT RE OPENS OUR INDUSTRY- SO THAT IS MY THINKING AGAIN I JUST. FELT LIKE SAYING THAT- THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME IN THAT- BUT I WOULD SAY ON THE HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION ISSUE ALSO ALONG WITH SOME OF MY SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE HAVING SERVED. A LONG TIME- YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THE FEDERAL DOT AND HIGHWAY MINISTRATION SO FORTH I THINK AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN THESE AMENDMENTS ARE AT SUPPORT THIS TODAY. BUT TO REALLY REQUIRE AN AFFIRMATIVE. DOCUMENT OF SOME KIND OF FROM HOW IT MINISTRATION CONCURRENT WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF- OF THESE NEW BILLBOARDS I JUST DON'T TRUST EIGHT WE SAW WITH CHANGES OF ADMINISTRATION- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS COMMITMENTS THAT WERE MADE THAT WERE PULLED BACK IN. VERBAL COMMITMENTS THAT WERE MADE THAT WERE SOFTENED UP LATER ON AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- AGES. WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE INTO. ASSUMING THAT- WILL ALL GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS BILL AT SOME POINT- THAT- AND- YOU WOULD FEEL A LOT BETTER TO ME. TO NOT JUST. KEEP MOVING IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION BUT TO- YOU KNOW TO REQUIRE- PROOF OF THAT NON OBJECTION- FROM FROM THE FEDS BEFORE PROCEEDING AND I THINK THAT WOULD PROTECT EVERYONE INVOLVED INCLUDING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVESTING IN THESE BILLBOARDS IN- AT AND WOULD SUIT CAN ONLY ASSUME AT SOME POINT- IT TURNS INTO- THE LEGAL WORLD THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY PRETTY IF THAT HAPPENED SO. SO YOU JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN BUT- AT. UNLIKE THE BILL OVERALL AND- PRESHEAF THE AUTHOR BRING FORTH THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE WE HAVE ONE LAST MIKE UP BY SENATOR ALAN- YEAH I MEAN I LOOK AT. I'VE I'VE 'M I'M HAVE I'M WILLING THE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY TO GIVE YOU GOT THE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES BUT I WILL SAY THAT KNOW. I THINK THE FIRST MINUTE USER ARE REAL- AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO MAKE THE SIGN SMALLER THAT WOULD HELP- I KNOW THAT CALTRANS HAS BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG BATTLE OVER SIGNS IN INGLEWOOD AND IT'S JUST IT'S A BIG MASSIVE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. HI IN THIS WERE REALLY SMART ABOUT AND I WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR- REALLY SPENT SOME TIME DIGGING INTO THAT ISSUE- INSURING I THERE'S GOOD ENFORCEMENT AND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIES TO CLAMP DOWN. ON US BECAUSE I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE CERTAINLY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I AND BY THE WAY I UNDERSTAND WE'VE BEEN ACTING IN THIS MANNER FOR A LONG TIME THIS BILL I'M JUST GOING TO CONTINUE THE EXISTING PRACTICE BUT I DO THINK AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO PUT IN PLACE MECHANISMS THAT ARE GONNA ALLOW US TO RESPOND QUICKLY. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO- INFOWARS- THEIR THEIR RULES AND I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY SO I JUST WOULD ASK THAT THE CHAIR IN THE AUTHOR AND OTHERS- WORK ON ON ON REALLY TRYING TO TIGHTEN UP AND ENSURE FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S- I THINK I THINK THIS IS THIS JUST CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON THE RISK THAT WERE ALREADY TAKING AT THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN AND ALL JUST CONCLUDE WITH SAYING- YOU KNOW THE THIS IS BEEN A LONG DEBATED BETWEEN BOTH SIDES MIGHT- COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND OUR TEAM HAD WORKED WITH THE AUTHORED BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS. SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT WAS EMPTY AND- AMENABLE TO BOTH SIDES OF IN THE TIME BEING KNOWING THAT WE WOULD STILL NEGOTIATE FORWARD- SO AGAIN I. RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BRING THIS BACK IF THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO DEBATE. IF THERE'S CHANGES THAT. ARE AMENABLE MOVING FORWARD OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- BUT YOU BRING GOOD POINTS OF I THINK EVERYBODY'S ABOUT GREAT COMMENTS AND GREAT POINTS UP AND SO I THINK- AT THIS TIME I KNOW AND I HAVE TRUST THAT THE AUTHORS WILL WORK WITH BOTH SIDES TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. AND I PERSONALLY HEARD FROM MY LOCAL- YOU KNOW SMALLER BILLBOARD- FOLKS BACK AT HOME AND I'M YOU KNOW VERY. CONSCIOUS OF WHAT THEY'RE- ISSUES ARE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WITH THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER MIKES UP WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ARCH META. IS THAT CORRECT- IF I MADE ONE MORE JUST JUST TO CLARIFY. BECAUSE I STARTED OFF ABOUT A KNOWLEDGE IN THE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPLIANCE WITHIN- ARE WE ASKING THAT OR- PROBABLY INDICATING THAT BILLBOARDS IT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WILL EXCEED. THE. AND IF THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT. THEN IT WILL CONTINUE OR'S THIS INDICATING THAT ANY BILLBOARDS THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED WILL MAINTAIN THE SIZE THAT'S WITHIN CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. WE ARE WE TRYING TO MAKE AN EXEMPTION ON THEIR SITES AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WITH REGARDS TO THE SIZE RIGHT NOTE THE ISSUE HERE IS ABOUT CONTINUING THE EXEMPTION WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAVE- AND- YOU KNOW EXPAND THE NET TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE SIGNS WITHIN THE THOUSAND FEET WHICH IS WHAT YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT AND ADDING LANGUAGE WHICH MAKES UP A GIVES CALTRANS MUCH MORE POWER AND MUCH MORE STRENGTH. TO ENFORCE ANY SIGN OR OPPOSE ANY SIGN OR TAKE DOWN ANY SIGN THAT COULD THREATEN OUR FEDERAL FUNDING SO THAT'S THOSE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ADDED TO THE EXEMPTION THAT ALREADY EXIST. AND YOUR- A BID MARKET GOES BACK TO MY QUESTION SO IF THEY CONSTRUCTED SIGN THAT EXCEEDS THE REQUIRED. LIMITATIONS THAT'S GONNA BE OKAY NO BY DID- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. TAKE IT DOWN WELL AGAIN THERE ARE LOCALLY SHOULD EVEN BE CONSTRUCTED RIGHT SEEDING THE LIMITATIONS WHATEVER THE LOCAL RULES ARE THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY HAVE TO HAVE APPROVAL FROM THE LOCAL RULES BECAUSE THERE ARE LOCAL RULES LIKE IT'S NOT JUST FEDERAL RULES ARE LOCAL RULES THAT THEY ABIDE BY. THERE'S A STATE AND AS THE FEDERAL SO THE STATE WE'RE SAYING IS GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE POWER TO ENFORCE ESPECIALLY THE CONCERN RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE AT OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE CONCERN ABOUT THE THREAT TO LOSING FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDS SO ANYTHING THAT THREATENS THAT BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE ORDINANCES THAT THEY HAVE TO RESPECT. I AGAIN I'VE GOT IT. SENATE ARCHULETA IF WE CAN YEAH I KNOW I WHEN I WENT OUT THERE ARE YOU GOING OF FIVE A LOT OF CONVERSE. YET TO TAKE PLACE THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SAID ARCHULETA AND WE HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I'M I'M- AND I'M SO SORRY MADAM CHAIR AT YOU KNOW- MY COLLEAGUE REOPEN THE DISCUSSION BUT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU DIRECTLY- SENATOR. I'M DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE THAT THE FOLKS WHO WERE BENEFITING FROM THIS BILL. I TO FIGURE OUT DO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME COMPENSATION SCHEME FOR THE STATE. TO FOR THAT FOR THE RISK THAT WE'RE TAKING ON. BY ALLOWING FOR THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE AND GROW. SOME SORT OF TAX OR ROYALTY. AT AT AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THAT WASN'T THE POINT OF THIS BILL SO I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ASK THAT OF ANY INDUSTRY IS THAT IF THERE IS A POTENTIAL THREAT OR POTENTIAL VIOLATION IT IS NOT FREQUENT THAT WE PASS. LAWS EXECUTIVE BASICALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON FEDERAL LAW VIOLATIONS. WELL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DON'T AGREE THAT WE'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON FEDERAL LAW VIOLATIONS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS- THERE WILL BE MORE BILLBOARDS THAT ARE PUT UP IN THESE ARENAS. THAT IS NOT EQUAL TO DOUBLING DOWN ON A FEDERAL- VIOLATIONS I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION THERE'S NOT A CORRECT. A CLEAR CONNECTION THERE JUST BECAUSE MORE BILLBOARDS ARE GOING THIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE LADY BIRD JOHNSON ACT I MEAN THAT THE WHAT IS THIS THIS THIS THIS ACTIVITY. THIS YEAR THE THIS OF THIS TYPE OF APPROVAL OF SCIENCE. ON OUR HIGHWAYS. CENTER ALLEN ARE YOU ARE YOU FINISHED WITH YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING IS YOU'RE ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO GET IT ADDRESS BUT THAT WE ARE VERY CLEAR IN WHAT THE BILL STATES. IT DOESN'T DISCUSS ANY COMPENSATION WHICH MAY BE A GOOD IDEA BUT WE WELL OKAY THEN I GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE I DO THINK- I THINK WE'RE TAKING ON A RISK HERE I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN THREATENED- WITH WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL FUNDS BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A RISK. AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE BAKED INTO OUR WORK IN THIS SPACE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATORS I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE ONCE AGAIN- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ARCHER LET I BELIEVE. WHO MOVED THE BILL. MISTER CHIEF CONSERVE OUR US SENATOR DORADO I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN.

THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY AND EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF PARTS INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND GIVE THE OFFICE MORE PROTECTION FROM IMPROPER INTERFERENCE IN ITS WORK. BAY AREA VOTERS CREATED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AS A PART OF A BALLOT MEASURE THAT ALSO GAVE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES THE POWER TO RAISE BRIDGE TOLLS TO FINANCE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S AN IMPORTANT OFFICE. GIVES THE PUBLIC AND SYSTEM RIDERS INDEPENDENT SET OF EYES AND EARS. TO MONITOR THE AGENCY SPENDING AND OPERATIONS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH FORMER STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWLE TWO RESEARCH AND CRAFT THIS BILL. AND MOST OF WHAT ARE WE ARE PROPOSING IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY THE STATE AUDITOR THE CALTRANS INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE LOS ANGELES METRO INSPECTOR GENERAL. MS HOW SUPPORTS THE BILL AS TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSPECTOR GENERALS IN THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUDITORS. ALL THESE FOLKS SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE BART INSPECTOR GENERAL NEEDS THESE CHANGES. TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THE MISSION THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE VOTERS ASK THEM TO DO. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE OFFICE SHOULD HAVE THE INDEPENDENCE TO CONDUCT ITS WORK. IN CONFORMITY WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS. PUBLISHED BY THE CAN COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS FOR OFFICES OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. PUBLISHED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF INSPECTOR GENERALS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL GIVES THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ACCESS TO AGENCY DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHT TO INTERVIEW EMPLOYEES. IT ALSO GIVES THE OFFICE THE ABILITY TO HIRE STAFF PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL COMPUTER FILES FROM IMPROPER DISCLOSURE. AND FINALLY THE BILL ALSO RAISES THE BAR FOR FIRING AN INSPECTOR GENERAL DURING THEIR FOUR YEAR TERM. ENSURING THAT THEY WILL ONLY BE DISMISSED FOR MALFEASANCE AND NOT BECAUSE THEIR WORK IS AN IRRITANT OR EMBARRASSING TO THE STAFF OR THE BOARD OF THE AGENCY. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL R.

THERE'S BROAD CONSENSUS WITHIN THE O. I. G. COMMUNITIES THE ELEMENT OF THIS BILL ARE COMMON PRACTICES WITHIN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE IT'LL SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BARCODE YG. I. STABBINGS AND CLARIFYING THE PROCESS FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. HIRING EVALUATION RETENTION OF THE- I. T. STAFF AND CONSULTANTS. THE REFINEMENT OF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. HE ACCESS TO RECORDS PROPERTY EMPLOYEES. OFFICERS AND CONTRACTORS SUBPOENA AUTHORITY. ALSO THE REQUIREMENT OF BART'S RESPONSE TO- IG RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMS AND RECORDS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT FROM THOSE MAINTAINED BY PART. SO IMPLEMENTED IN VARIOUS MANNERS FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE THE OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE ONE THING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL.

MICHAEL WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZE AND EMPOWER INDIGENOUS MIGRANTS IN THE MEXICAN STATE OF OAXACA AND GUERRERO. INCLUDING MISTAKES SUPPLE TEXAS AND WOOD APERTURE. INDIGENOUS MIGRANT POPULATIONS FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES INCLUDING BARRIERS LANGUAGE BARRIERS AS THEY OFTEN ONLY SPEAK THEIR NATIVE PRECOLONIAL LANGUAGES. THEY HAVE DEEP ROOTED CULTURAL PRACTICES AND BELIEVES. THAT OFTEN CREATE BARRIERS AND ISOLATE THEM FROM OTHER MORE ESTABLISHED LATINO POPULATIONS. OVER 50% OF FARMWORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE OF INDIGENOUS MIGRANT THE SENATE. AND MANY INDIGENOUS FAMILIES EARN MEAGER WAGES IN CALIFORNIA'S MULTIBILLION DOLLAR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. FURTHERMORE LANGUAGE BARRIERS PREVENT ACCESS TO AVAILABLE BASIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING THE SERVICES THAT THE CALIFORNIA DMV. GIVEN THE MYRIAD OF LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY CALIFORNIANS. THE DMV SERVICES MUST BE HIGHLY TARGETED AND FLEXIBLE TO MEET THE LANGUAGE DIVERSITY NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS LIKE TWICE DMV SERVICES WERE ORIGINALLY NOT DESIGNED FOR CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS POPULATION MANY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE MIGRATE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE FOLLOWING SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORK. T. BE SERVICES SHOULD BE ADAPTABLE TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT AND MIGRANT POPULATION. DUE TO THE REGIMENTED DAY TO DAY STRUCTURE INACCESSIBLE DURING THE TYPICAL WORK WEEK FOR FARMWORKERS SATURDAYS ALSO PREVENT CHALLENGES SINCE AGRICULTURAL WORK ALSO CONTINUES THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

THE MOTION IS A TO PASS AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS GONZALEZ I HI SENATE DEBATES NOT VOTING. ALLEN ARCHULETA WHICH LETTER I. BAKER CORTESE. DOLLY DOT DADABHAI LIMÓN MCGUIRE MCGUIRE AYE MELENDEZ MELENDEZ NO MAN MAN HI NEWMAN. RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER ONE WILL PUT DOUBLE BILL ON CALL FOR MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT HERE. NEXT BILL AND IS THAT GOING TO BE ELEVEN TWENTY ONE OKAY SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE SENATOR GONZALEZ YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU I KNOW WE'RE ALMOST DONE A MANAGER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH- MEMBERS AT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AS WE KNOW WHICH INCLUDES ROADS HIGHWAYS TRANSIT AND BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES IS SUCH AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL INFRASTRUCTURE YET DESPITE THAT IMPORTANCE WE LACK A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING NEEDS FOR BOTH STATE AND LOCAL FACILITIES AND HOW THOSE WILL BE MET. SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS LACK OF INFORMATION BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO DO THREE THINGS FIRST AND FOR MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE CTT CTC TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF HOW MUCH FUNDING WE WILL NEED TO MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT INFRASTRUCTURE SECOND THE BILL REQUIRES THE CTC TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH FUNDING WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL SOURCES WHAT CAN WE REALISTICALLY EXPECT THIRD IF THERE'S A SHORTFALL THE CTC SHALL RECOMMEND HOW TO ADDRESS IT. AND IN TURN HELP CANCERS SUCH A SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS WELL DO WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE OR SPEND LESS ARE THERE EFFICIENCIES WE CAN DEPLOY SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE WITH EXISTING RESOURCES OR DO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES OVERALL WITH THIS INFORMATION POLICYMAKERS LIKE OURSELVES STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF PLANNING FOR FUTURE TO CREATE THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT MEETS OUR NEEDS AND OUR RESOURCES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY I HAVE MARC WATTS WITH TRANSPORTATION. CALIFORNIA WHO SHOULD BE HERE IN THE GALLERY. AND THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES I BELIEVE BOTH HERE IN THE CHAMBERS- MISTER WALKS. AND CHRIS LEAK CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BURST CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THIS BILL WE THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EXERCISE FOR THE STATE TO DO. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING EVERY TWO YEARS AT THE CITY COUNTY AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION LEVEL LOOKING AT THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE THINK NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL ARE A GREAT WAY TO HELP DEFINE GOALS REALLY PUT A FIRM NUMBER AROUND WHAT THINGS COST BUT ALSO TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THE TRADEOFFS THAT WE FACE SO FOR INSTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TRADE OFF BETWEEN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING SYSTEM. AND MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSFORMING IT TO BETTER MEET TODAY'S TRANSPORTATION GOAL SO WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT HOW DO WE PROVIDE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION SAFE ACCESS FOR BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS AND BALANCE THAT WITH THE NEEDS FOR SYSTEM PRESERVATION. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT SIMPLY BY MEASURING IN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS WE CAN HELP DRIVE POLICY CHANGES JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF OUR MOST RECENT LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS NEEDS ASSESSMENT. 88% OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOW USING A PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE REALLY EFFICIENTLY APPLYING THEIR MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES THAT'S REPRESENTING OVER 98% OF THE LOCAL LANE MILES WE SEEM HUGE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE DOING COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE STREETS POLICIES. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY WHICH IS THREE TIMES AS MANY AS WE'RE DOING THAT WE STARTED DOING THE SURVEY SURVEY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND FINALLY AGAIN IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY WE SAW THAT 76% OF LOCAL AGENCIES ARE STARTING TO USE SUSTAINABLE PAVING PRACTICES LIKE RECYCLING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND SO INSTANCE JUST SAID OF JUST MEASURING KIND OF THE CONDITIONS IN THE FUNDING NEEDS. IT REALLY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON TRADE OFFS ON POLICY IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER CREATIVE APPROACHES THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO TAKE TO REALLY ADEQUATELY MAINTAIN OUR SYSTEM AND IMPROVE IT FOR TODAY'S TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND WE THINK THIS BILL IS A GREAT STEP. TO GET THE STATE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT LEAVE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY US MR WATER FLOODS HERE OR PERHAPS ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE THAT A MODERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES AND SEE IF OUR PRIMARY WITNESS MISTER WHAT MIGHT BE OR WANTING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE.

SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND WOULD NOTE THAT TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA WAS THE SPONSOR OF SENATOR BURDENS SENATE RESOLUTION EIGHT OF NINETEEN NINE NINE THAT IS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. WE THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE A CARPENTER GOING. OF THE STATE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT'S CLIMATE CHALLENGES CONTINUE. AND RESILIENCY NEEDS ARE INCREASING AND MOBILITY SYSTEMS ARE BEGINNING OKAY. AND AS OUR OVERALL BAKER THEMAJORS. THIS BILL WILL GIVE US A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING- TO MEET OUR STATE'S FUTURE NEEDS.

THANK YOU DEAR GONZALEZ THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS BILL. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE TEN LARGEST PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATORS CALIFORNIA. TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON HARASSMENT EXPERIENCED BY WRITERS AND USE THAT DATA TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO PRIORITIZE RATE RIDER SAFETY COMFORT AND DIGNITY. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH SAFETY CHALLENGES WHEN USING PUBLIC TRANSIT. MANY OF US HAVE HAD TO OR NO ONE ELSE SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S HAD TO CHANGE A TRANSIT ROUTE TO AVOID HARASSMENT. THE DATA SHOWS THAT HARASSMENT ON PUBLIC TRANSIT UNFORTUNATELY DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS WOMEN. LGBTQ PUS RIDERS MINORITIES AND OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATEWIDE STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO CENTER ON GENDER EQUITY AND HEALTH. 77% OF WOMEN HAD EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN A PUBLIC SPACE INCLUDING 29% IN MASS TRANSIT. THIS IS EVEN MORE COMMON WITH WOMEN HO IDENTIFY. AS LESBIAN OR BISEXUAL. AND AS WE SEEM THE CALL NINETY PENDING IN HIS ISLANDERS ON A SHARP INCREASE. SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THE STOP ÁP I HATE COALITION HAS RECEIVED OVER TEN THOUSAND REPORTS OF HATE INCIDENTS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND ALMOST 50% OF THOSE INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE AT PUBLIC VENUES INCLUDING STREETS IN PARKS AND ON TRANSIT. IN ADDITION API'S BLACK WOMEN LATINO WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THE L. G. B. Q. AND T. G. I. COMMUNITIES IN YOUNG AND ELDERLY ALSO EXPERIENCE. DISPROPORTIONATE SHARES OF STREET HARASSMENT ON TRANSIT. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ONE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS NOW AND SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE WOULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD STOPPING THAT CYCLE HARASSMENT. BY AGAIN REQUIRING THE STATE'S TEN LARGEST TRANSIT OPERATORS TO COLLECT RIDERSHIP DATA AND TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO SUPPORT SAFE TRANSIT EXPERIENCES. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN PERSON I HAVE SENT THE CHECK FROM STOP ÁP I HATE. AND ON THE PHONE I HAVE ALEX AMADEO ON BEHALF OF ELEMENTARY.

MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PORTS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. A MAJORITY OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED BY API WOMEN AND THE VAST MAJORITY WERE HONDA THAT IS NOT A CRIME SUCH AS BARBARA SMITH. ABOUT THE SINCE OCCURRED IN PUBLIC SPACES SUCH AS SIDEWALKS PARKS AND TRANSIT.
