MICHAEL GOOD ZERO APPLICANTS AMANDA COMPLETELY. I FELT I WAS PROBABLY SENT RECALLED MORE RECENTLY THAN YOU I JUST GOT HERE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THAT LOCAL PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNELS BE DELIVERED. TO THE PUBLIC IN HIGH DEFINITION OR THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY USED BY LOCAL BROADCAST TELEVISION CHANNELS IMPORTANTLY THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT ANY DOCUMENTS PRESENTED AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS ARE READABLE WOULD MAKE CAPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED OR DEAF. IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN VIDEO COMPETITION ACT ALSO KNOWN AS DEATH BECAUSE- IT WAS ENACTED THERE HAVE BEEN MASSIVE CHANGES TO THE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY VIDEO SERVICES. VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDERS JUSTIN THE PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN TECHNOLOGY USE DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE IS ELECTED OFFICIALS INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC WITH MANY PUBLIC MEETING SHIFTING TO BEING VIRTUAL AND UTILIZING PLATFORMS LIKE ZOOM WHILE DIFFICULT REQUIRES THAT LOCAL PEG ACCESS CHANNELS BE PROVIDED BY CABLE AND VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THOSE CHANNELS TO BE DELIVERED AN UP TO DATE FORMAT SUCH AS HIGH DEFINITION IN PRACTICE THIS HAS ALLOWED THE VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DOWNGRADE THE PEG ACCESS CHANNEL SIGNALS AND BROADCAST THE PROGRAMMING IN THE OBSOLETE STANDARD DEFINITION FORMAT. AS A RESULT DETAILED INFORMATION DISPLAYED DURING ZOOM DELIVER PUBLIC MEETINGS IS UNCLEAR AND UNREADABLE SINCE SD VIDEO IMAGES ARE NOT CLEARLY DISPLAYED ON HD TELEVISIONS AUDIENCES THAT ARE DEAF OR HEARING IMPAIRED AND RELY ON CAPTIONING WILL OFTEN SEE THOSE CAPTIONS ALLEGEDLY. OR NOT AT ALL WHEN H. D. PROGRAM IS DOWNGRADED TESTY. AB TWENTY SO THIRTY FIVE. DOES NOT INCREASE COSTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ANYWAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENTAL EDUCATIONAL AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING IS ALREADY PRODUCED IN HIGH DEF. ANY REMAINING USAGE OF STANDARDIZED MISSION IS PROTECTED IN THE BILL'S LANGUAGE THE ONLY MANDATE IN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE IS THAT H. DEPRIEST VIDEOS NOT BE DOWNGRADED. TO A LOWER TRANSMISSION STANDARD AND IT IS PRODUCED IN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING EQUITABLE AND MEANINGFUL PUBLIC ACCESS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMMING INCLUDING GOVERNMENT MEETINGS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITNESSES HERE. ALL UP I'M SORRY WE'RE GONNA JUMP IN IT LOOKS LIKE WE DO HAVE A QUORUM CAN WE GET THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. QUIRK-SILVA HERE COOK QUIRK-SILVA PRESIDENT PATTERSON PATTERSON PRINCE PRESENT BOERNER HORVATH.

ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES OR THE CONSENT ITEMS AND WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO OUR SUPPORT WITNESSES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL LIZA MAKER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY MEDIA CENTER MARIN. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WE HAVE OPERATED MARIN TV'S THREE PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNELS. OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AND GOVERNMENTAL ALSO REFERRED TO AS HECK. OUR CHANNEL SERVICING ENTIRE COUNTY OF MARIN AN ESTIMATED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR ACCOUNTING MORAN TEND TOWARD OLDER FOLKS SO THEY PREFER WATCHING TELEVISION RATHER THAN WATCHING. MEETINGS ON ANOTHER COMPUTER- ARE CHANNELS DELIVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND HOURS OF PROGRAMMING EACH YEAR. AND OUR GOVERNMENT CHANNEL ALONE CARRIES A MEETINGS OF TEN LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THE COUNTY AND NUMEROUS AGENCIES MOST OF WHICH ARE CARRIED LIVE. OUR CURRENT CABLE PROVIDERS ARE COMCAST AND AT&amp;T. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE COMCAST SINCE AT&amp;T IS SINCE DISCONTINUED UNIVERSE FOR NEW SUBSCRIBERS- AS MARK MENTIONED ARE CHANNELS FOR. CABLE KHAIRUL ARCTIC CHANNELS ARE GENERATED IN HIGH DEFINITION BUT THE CABLE OPERATOR RELAYS THEM TO SUBSCRIBERS IN SANDARD DEF. THAT'S REDUCING A SIXTEEN BY NINE IMAGE TO FOUR BY THREE. IT SQUEEZES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING BECOMES BLURRY SMALLER. AND ILLEGIBLE. IT'S ALSO DEGRADED BECAUSE THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PIXELS BY EIGHTY PERCENT. SO IT'S A HUGE LOSS OF RESOLUTION- OUR NEED FOR HD CARRIAGE IS QUITE SIMPLE. IT'S REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE VISUAL INFORMATION BEING CONVEYED BY OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS WERE OFTEN CALLED UPON TO CARRY SPECIAL LIVE. PROGRAMMING IN THE PAST WITH THE- OF LIFE BRIEFINGS FOR WILDFIRE EVENTS PROVIDE HEALTH UPDATES. ALL SORTS OF THINGS THOSE ARE FULL OF VISUAL GRAPHICS THAT BECOME ILLEGIBLE. SO WE REALLY NEED HD- EQUIPMENT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SIR THERE'S THREE PIECES THE FIRST IS A PEGS CENTERS ABILITY TO DELIVER HD WE'VE HAD THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SECOND AS THE TRANSPORT THAT CITY FIBER FROM OUR CENTER TO THE CABLE HAD AND WE'VE HAD THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE VIRTUALLY EVERY CABLE CENTER HAS THE STOMACH AND THE- STATE. THE THIRD IS THE CABLE HEAD AND- WHICH- THEN RELAYS THAT SIGNAL TO ALL THE CABLE SUBSCRIBERS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUR FIBER ENCODERS WERE UPGRADED HD COMCAST WAS UPGRADING THE HEAD AND- THEY NEEDED TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. SO SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE HAD ABILITY THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO DELIVER OUR CHANNELS IN HD THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. THE ENGINEERS WILL SAY. IT'S A FLIP OF A SWITCH- BUT YOU HAVE TO TALK TO MANAGEMENT. SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND- WE NEED THIS TERRIBLY- OUR VIEWERS DEMANDED. THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED MOST OFTEN- BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND VIEWERS IS WIDER CHANNELS LOOK SO BAD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIX IT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE- MY NAME IS SUE BUS SKI I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALLIANCE FOR COMMUNICATIONS DEMOCRACY. I WORKED IN THE CABLE COMMUNICATIONS BILL SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. THE GOAL OF AB AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE IS THE HELP PUBLIC EDUCATION AND GOVERNMENT CHANNELS APPEAR LIKE ANY OTHER CHANNEL ON CABLE SYSTEM. IT WAS ALWAYS OF CREATED LOCAL PROGRAMMING FOR YEARS SO WHY ISN'T DELIVERED IN HD. BECAUSE DIFFICULT OUR STATE LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THE CABLE PROVIDERS TO DELIVER AN HD- ON PIG TAILS ARE A LIFELINE FOR SENIORS VOLATILE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T COMFORTABLE USING THE INTERNET OR- DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND OR- OR OR JUST CAN'T REPORT. DURING THE CALL THE PANDEMIC THEY CONNECTED WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS SCHOOLS AND CHURCH SERVICES THROUGH THE USE OF THE PAY CHANNELS. OVER THERE TO WATCH PAID PROGRAMMING- INSIDE THE THICK BLACK FRAME WITH UNREADABLE CAPTIONS FUZZY GRAPHICS ELLEN THIS IS BECAUSE OF THAT NASTY NOT HD EVEN THOUGH THE CONTENT IS CREATED IN HD. YOUR SACRAMENTO COMCAST DELIVERED HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY OF THOSE CHANNELS ARE DELIVERED IN BOTH HD AND SD INCLUDING MANY SHOPPING CHANNELS TWENTY FIVE SPORTS CHANNELS AND THIRTY PREMIUM CHANNELS LIKE HBO. YEAH WE'RE TOLD BY THE CABLE INDUSTRY THAT I FEEL COMMUNITY CHANNELS AVAILABLE IN HD AND THE ESTEY IS JUST NOT GOOD USE A BAND WITH. BECAUSE THERE'S LIMITED VIEWERSHIP. BUT LET'S FACE IT THE OLD FASHIONED CONCEPT OF LIMITED VIEWERSHIP ISN'T RELEVANT TODAY. TODAY EVERY CHANNEL HAS LIMITED VIEWERSHIP THERE THOUSANDS OF CHANNELS ON TV RATINGS THAT ONLY FIVE OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY NETWORKS. ARE THAT ARE ARE WATCHED BY 1% OF THE US POPULATION. IN FACT NEARLY HALF OF THOSE ARE WATCHED. BY LESS THAN ONE TENTH OF 1% CALIFORNIA BELIEVE IN THE FOR OF OUR CAN COULD TECH OBVIOUSLY. YEP PENSION IN NINETEEN OTHER STATES. HAVE BEEN DELIVERED IN H. D. FOR MANY YEARS THE PAY CHANNELS IN PORTLAND IN THE SUBURBS OF PORTLAND AS AN EXAMPLE. HAVE AND HAD EACH DEEPER EIGHT YEARS AND THEY HAVE EIGHT CHANNELS DELIVERED IN HD. ON AS WELL AS AT SPEED SINCE THEIR CABLE FRANCHISES RENEGOTIATED THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THE BASIC NEEDS LIKE UPDATING TECHNOLOGY OR OR CONSUMER PROTECTION CAN BE DEALT WITH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF DIFFICULT WE HAVE TO DO IT AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO LET'S CATCH UP WITH OTHER STATES AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL EVENT COVERAGE GOVERNMENT MEETINGS. ALL OF THAT CONTENT IS IN THE HIGH QUALITY THAT'S ALREADY PRODUCED. ON OUR SENIOR SHOULD SEIZE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS OUR CHURCH SERVICES AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. WITH CLEAN VIEWABLE IMAGES AND IN TODAY'S WORLD IS HD. THANK YOU- WITH THAT DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM. WHAT SUPPORT YEAH CHEN MEMBERS CATALINA SANCHEZ WITH CORBIN AND KAISER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. VIDEO ALL RIGHT AND WITH THAT THEN WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION WITHOUT ANYBODY TESTIFYING. BECAUSE OPPOSITION. FIFTY MADAM CHAIR AT MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION GREAT DISCUSSION WHAT YOU HEARD THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE HERE THIS IS ABOUT ABILITY TO PAY SO- THE GYM IS VERY CORRECT ABOUT HAVING A FIBRE LINE FROM THE STUDIO TO ARE HEADED BECAUSE HD CONTENT TAKES THREE TIMES MORE BANDWIDTH THAN STANDARD THAT DEFINITION TELEVISION. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PAID CHANNELS THAT HAVE UPGRADE BUT THEY HAVE PAID FOR THEIR UPGRADE TO THE FIBER LINE HAVE PAID FOR THE UPGRADE AT THE HEAD AND THEY HAVE PAID FOR THE CHANNEL SO THIS IS AN ISSUE OF DO YOU WANT TO VOTE TO GIVE AWAY SOMETHING FOR FREE THAT PAKE AT YOUR RIGHT DIFFICULT REQUIRES PAID TO BE IN THE BASIC TIER OF THE CABLE BREAKS- PAIGAH- PACKAGE SO THAT'S WHERE PEAK OF THAT THAT IS IN STATURE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. ANY UPGRADE TO AN HD CHANNEL THOSE ARE PREMIUM CHANNELS THAT'S WHERE YOU GET A THE OTHER CHANNELS ARE PREMIUM THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR THESE TO DO THAT IT IS TO SAY PORTION OF DO THEY WANT TO PAY FOR THAT OR NOT- WE DO GIVE EVERY COMMUNITY PROFITS ARE GROSS RECEIPTS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR ANY KIND OF CAPITAL UPGRADE. THIS IS PERMISSIBLE SO WITH THAT 1% OF THE PAKE FEE THAT WE PAY COMMUNITIES THEY CAN USE THOSE FUNDS FOR CAPITAL COSTS WE ALSO PAY LOCAL COMMUNITIES ANOTHER 5% OF OUR GROSS RECEIPTS AGAIN NOT PROFITS GROSS RECEIPTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE AS THEY CHOOSE SO THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION OF A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP SO I THINK THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO GET IN BETWEEN DISCUSSIONS OTHER PAID CHANNELS HAVE UPGRADE TO HD CHANNELS BUT THEY'RE PAID FOR IT SO. ARE WE LOOKING FOR A FREE LUNCH HERE OR WHAT IS WHAT IS THE PLAN THAT. IS A QUESTION FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES FIRST IN SUPPORT. AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAIN ONE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT.

AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN Q. ALRIGHT AND THEN PUT IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- FOR THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO JUST- HAVE YOU ADDRESSED THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION AS FAR AS THIS BILL- WE WOULD BE INTERFERING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RELATIONSHIP MIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON A LOCAL LEVEL AND I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION ARE THERE ANY OTHER. COMPANIES THAT HAVE UPGRADED. YES SO ESSENTIALLY- THE IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE UPGRADED. TYPICALLY LIKE IN THIS INSTANCE THAT MISTRY'S MUNGER IT HAD MENTIONED. IT IS BEING CONVEYED IN HD IT WAS PRODUCING HD IT'S GOING TO BE CONVEYED IN HD. IN THIS INSTANCE THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO WHY BECAUSE IT COMPETES WITH SAY HI IS WATCHING SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT THERE THE COST. IS LITTLETON A THING BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION CAN'T TELL US WHAT THAT COST WOULD BE THEY DON'T WANT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT. THEY NEED TO YOU KNOW DISCUSS NEGOTIATED PUBLIC ACCESS WE CONDUCT OPEN MEETINGS PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO THROUGH DECCA- PEOPLE DON'T WATCH THAT BECAUSE I'D RATHER THEM. ONTO THE BUS SOMETHING ON DEMAND OR WATCH SOMETHING WITH TV COMMERCIALS SOMETHING THAT'S PROFITABLE RATHER THAN WHAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED- SO I KIND OF CHOKED ON THAT FREE LUNCH COMMENT. RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER THE NOTE NEGOTIATION UNDER DIFFICULT. THAT WE ALL BENEFIT FROM BECAUSE GOVERNMENT IS OPEN THAT WAY BUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING COULD YOU CAN'T READ THE INFORMATION. ON WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY RESPONSE OKAY BUT MY QUESTION IS- ARE THERE ANY COUNTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE TRANSMITTING. HI THERE LOCAL YET YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN SO IT. IT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO THE CONVEYANCE. COMPETITIVE TO NOT ALLOW THAT PUBLIC ACCESS PROGRAMMING TO COME AWAY AND A COME A CALL ACROSS TO BE BROADCAST IN A WAY THAT CAN BE- CONSUME TO US THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION A GOVERNMENT OR OTHERS ARE TRYING TO CONVEY IN THAT. SO YOU'RE SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY HAVE DECIDED WHICH COUNTIES ARE GONNA SHOW EVERY- EVERY COUNTY WELL MICHAEL YOU PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THIS DIFFERENTLY. FROM MY TIME WHEN I WAS ON A LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATION COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY FRANCHISES WERE NEGOTIATED BY LOCAL FRANCHISE WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE COUNTY- IT CAN BE. JUST WHATEVER THAT FRANCHISE SPACES LAW CHANGED TO GIVE CUT- WHICH GOVERNS IT SINCE THEN AND IF I'M NOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN I CAN YEAH WE'RE BASICALLY UNDER DIFFICULT LOCAL FRANCHISE AUTHORITIES WHETHER THEY BE A COUNTY OR A MUNICIPALITY. THEY HAVE NO ROOM TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CABLE OPERATOR- DIFFICULT HAS SET THE RULES AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO LIVE BY. SO THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN. A NOTE CABLE UP. TO PROVIDE H. CARRIAGE TO THESE ON- OF PUBLIC INTEREST CHANNELS WHICH IS A PAY CHANNELS. IS TWO. YOU KNOW A- YOU KNOW DISCOVER PASS THIS. LEGISLATION OKAY SO I JUST WANNA. I JUST I'M A I'M- SO ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THERE ARE NO. LOCAL FOR. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE. THAT THAT LISTING LOCAL FRANCHISES WERE ON BOARD- THEY'RE ALL HAVING THE SAME ISSUE BECAUSE IT SOUNDED TO-ME LIKE. IT COULD BE NEGOTIATED LOCAL FOR. OUT OF THEM ARE OPERATE UNDER DISCUSSION- AND SO. THEY ARE CHOOSING WHEN THEY WANT TO DO THE CONVEYANCE IN HD OR NOT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S ON US TO THEN TABLE DIFFICULT DIDN'T ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT ANALOG CHANNELS THERE USED TO BE A LOT OF PUBLIC ACCESS TV OUT THERE. I LOOK UP FAR MORE BROAD BROADBAND THEN- THE H. D. DOES CHAIR I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS LIKE OUT OF ORDER BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CC TA COME UP AND ANSWER SME OF THESE QUESTIONS AS WELL. BECAUSE IT I FEEL LIKE I'M HEARING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS AND- IT. WELL- HE WE WANT TO GET. TRANSPARENT CONVERSATION GOING HERE SO THEY'RE ABLE TO ANSWER SO LET ME HAVE COMCAST- REPRESENTATIVE COME UP AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I DO WISH HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WHAT THE OPPOSITE. COMCAST HAD SAID WAS REGARD PLEADED TO PAY IN FOR. SO BRANCH RIGHT- THE WASHINGTON THREE THOUSAND SIX. CORRECT IN THAT IN THAT REGARD. THERE IS NO PROVISION HOWEVER FROM NEGOTIATING ADDITIONAL PROVISION FOR YOUR CANNOT BE YOU CHOOSE TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PROVIDER YOU CAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE HAVE HD YOU CAN'T THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU FOR. THE DISCUSS THEIR- HAS EVERY OF THE MINIMUMS THAT WE HAVE TO MEET AND THAT IS THAT WE MY PROVIDE. PAID CHANNEL THE LOCAL WHERE WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN ADDITION SO THAT THAT'S A FREE CHANNELS WITH A LOT OF MONEY SO IN ADDITION TO THAT WE MUST GIVE THEM. 1% OF OUR GROSS RECEIPTS TO USE FOR THE STUDIOS FOR THIS PICTURE HILLS. AND WE MUST GIVE THEM ANOTHER 5% OF OUR GROSS RECEIPTS TO USE ANYWHERE THEY WANT IN THEIR GENERAL FUND. NOW THE NUMBER OF PICK UP FOR US UP THERE. I JUST AND JUST THE NUMBER OF PAID CHANNELS PLUS. CORRECTLY DURING THE OLD LOCAL FRANCHISING DAYS WHEN WE DID NEGOTIATE INDIVIDUALLY CITY BY CITY COUNTY BY COUNTY THEY NEGOTIATE THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS THAT THEY WANT. SO THOSE CHANNELS WERE GRANDFATHERED IN SO IF MARIN HAD FIVE PATIENTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY KEPT THOSE FIVE PATIENTS A DAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT NUMBER YOU HAVE FOR MARIN BUT- AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THEN THERE IS A BARE MINIMUM THAT FOR ANY NEW COMMUNITIES THAT YOU GET A STATE FRANCHISE THAT YOU MUST PROVIDE A MINIMUM- PICTURE FOR THAT COMMUNITY. OKAY SITES ALL ASK YOU THIS SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IS THAT DIFFICULT THE- ESTABLISH THE FLOOR BUT NOT THE CEILING. CORRECT OKAY AND SO FRANCHISE A LOCAL ENTITY WANTED MORE THAN WHAT DIFFICULT OFFERS THEY COULD STILL NEGOTIATE WITH YOU ALL FOR THAT. CORRECT SO IF IT LOCAL FRANCHISING IT IF A LOCAL AGENCY- PAKE JANET WANTED TO UPGRADE TO HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION. IT AND AGAIN THAT TAKES THREE TIMES MORE BANDWIDTH THAN STANDARD DEFINITION YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A FIGHT A DEDICATED FIBER LINE FROM THE STUDIO TO THE HEAD AND THEN YOU MUST UPGRADE THE EQUIPMENT AT THE HEAD AND YOU MUST HAVE HD CHANNEL TO IT TO GET THAT ALL TO WORK SO IT LIKE CHANNEL THREE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU SEE CHANNEL THREE. IT'S IN THE BASIC TIER- IS CHANNEL THREE BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIGH DEFINITION CHANNELS THREE PAYS FOR HIGH DEFINITION TO A CHANNEL THAT PARALLELS THAT CHANNEL THREE IT'S LIKE GENERAL MOTORS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OR SOMETHING. SO IT'S A HIGHER TIER BUT IT THAT THAT H. D. TIER IS A DIFFERENT HERE THAN THE BASIC CABLE WHICH IS DIFFICULT. SPECIFIES THAT WE PROVIDE THE PAY CHANNELS IN STANDARD DEFINITION. I'M GONNA- IF WE OTHER MAY. AND THEN WE CAN BACK BUT- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION AND DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THAT SO LET'S GO HEAD TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA I ALSO IT WAS JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE BIT AT THE CALCULUS THAT THAT BUT THE COST FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SO- I HEARD OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT SIX PERCENT. OF IT YOU KNOW GROSS PROCEEDS GOING ALREADY TO LOCAL CHANNELS- I ALSO HEARD SOME SPECIFICITY AROUNDS- THE SPECIFIC THAT THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. I'M FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I WOULD LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF THE OVERALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH- BEING ABLE TO CONVERT TO AN HD WHICH IS. THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS. MS AND THE POTENTIAL COST BURDEN. TO THE LOCAL. WELL I MEAN I. THE IS THERE RIGHT SO YOU'RE PRODUCING IN HD MOST OF THESE PLACES HAVE ALL THE CAPACITY TO DO HD- IT IS A CHOICE NOT TO PROVIDE H. D. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOING DOWN THE WRONG ROAD TO SAY. THAT WE SHOULD BE TREATING A PEG- CHANNEL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PER PROVIDES ESSENTIAL INFORMATION SERVICES LIKE OPEN GOVERNMENT MEETINGS WITH AN NBC AFFILIATE. WHICH IS WHAT MR ROSCOE JUST AT THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING. AND SO- I DO THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COSTING LOTS OF MONEY THEY THEY CAN'T QUANTIFY THAT BAND WITH EXISTS THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE TO SUPPORT THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING IN. WHEN THEY DECIDE TO. S. B. O. G. AT GEOGRAPHICAL AREA TO GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SUMMER CHOOSING TO CONVEY IT IN HD. AND OTHERS ARE DOWNGRADING THAT'S ESSENTIALLY A CHOICE THAT THEY ARE MAKING- AND SO THIS BILL SAYS WHEN YOU HAVE H. THE A BIT AVAILABILITY. AND WHEN THINGS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN HD PLEASE CONVEY AND H. D. SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY. SEE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS AND READ THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SHARED. YEAH AND- WE HAVE A- AND FOR I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND LET OUR NEXT MEMBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID USE AND ASK A QUESTION THANK YOU- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO UPGRADE THAT MAKES COMMON SENSE TO ME. BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHERE I'M LOOKING AT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY'RE STOPPING YOU FROM THE LOCAL- AGENCY TO I'M ACTUALLY UPGRADE IT'S REALLY GETTING DOWN TO WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT. AND IF IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT MUCH WHY CAN'T THEY USE IT FROM THE 5% FRANCHISE FEE OR THE ONE PERCENT- WHICH IS THE- GROSS RECEIPTS RECEIPTS. BECAUSE SOME THEY CAN DO THAT SO THAT IT'S REALLY THE LOCALITY DECIDING DO WE WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY TO UPGRADE OR DO WE NOT OR MIKE BEING CONFUSED HERE NO I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING- A TRIP SERVICES RESPECTFULLY AS I CAN LIKE THAT DEBATE. THAT THEY WANT THEY WANT THE STATE NOT TO. MENTION THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PICK OFF. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND GET MONEY OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BROADCAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO. SO THE MEETINGS ARE ALREADY THAT PRODUCED IN HD- THEY CAN BE CONVEYED IN HD THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO DO IT THE THAT THERE IS NO REAL COST EXCEPT THE COST THAT THEY WANT TO ENCOURAGE UPON LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ALREADY DO. IN JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP FOR ME- AGAIN IF THEY HAVE 5% HERE 1% THERE MY CONCERN IS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IS THIS GOING TO END UP GOING TO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A COST SO IT'S EITHER GOING TO HIT THAT. EITHER IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT IT'S GONNA COME DOWN OR THE LOCAL LEVELS CAN GO AHEAD AND IT CAN COME DOWN SO I GUESS THE SAID THE PRODUCTS THERE NO ONE STOPPING ANYONE FROM GETTING IT IT'S REALLY WHO WANTS TO PAY FOR IT IS WHAT I'M SEEING HERE BUT THERE'S NOT- THERE'S JUST NO DAHLE. AMOUNTS THAT THEY'VE SAID THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD COST. FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR INFORMATION. CONVERTED AND THE HD UNLESS THEY- WANTED TO CHARGE WHAT THEY CHARGE. LIKE LESS I MENTIONED. A LOCAL NBC AFFILIATE. SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE THE BAND WITH IS THERE. THEY CAN JUST CONVEY IT. THERE'S NO EXTRA. TOLL TO GET ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY. IF YOU WILL. FOR THEM TO THEN. HAVE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETING. BE BROADCAST IN HD SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT THE COST IS. THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO BE COMPETING. AT WITH MEMBER STATIONS- SO THAT. THE ESSENTIALLY YEAH I MEAN I ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THAT. BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T IN THAT YET SO I YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN REALLY AFFORD TO COMPETE WITH THE LOCAL. NATIONAL BROADCAST CHANNEL SO I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK- AS A CHAIR OF ON IRAQ- I THINK ONE OF THE OVERALL. MESSAGES IS HERE IS WHAT DO OUR PUBLIC CHANNELS PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC. AND WHY ARE THEY THERE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. AND WHEN WE GET BACK TO IT WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR PUBLIC IN WHAT THEY RECEIVE. FROM THEIR LOCAL WHETHER IT'S THEIR LOCAL COMCAST OR LOCAL SPECTRUM. AND THAT IS A SERVICE AND THE SERVICE IS TO PROVIDE. A FEW OF YOU ARE COUNCIL BEFORE AND THOSE ARE TELEVISED BUT IF IN TURN THEIR TELEVISED UNANSWERED TRANSMITTED. YOU HAVE A VERY POOR VIEW OF THAT YOU'RE REALLY NOT GETTING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THAT'S THE INTENDED FOR DIFFICULT A AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORTED THAT. WHO DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT WANT TO COMMENT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ABOUT. YEAH SO I AM I AM WOULD LOVE SOME CLARITY ON ON COST NEXT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S NO COST. BUT CLEARLY IF YOU WOULD NEED TO RUN FIBER FROM POINT A TO POINT B. TO GET YOUR CHANNEL AVAILABLE IN HD THERE WOULD BE A COST THERE. SO THEY HAVE OTHER STATION. PAID FOR THAT PROCESS OF LAYING FIBER AND THEN I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE LAYING FIBER AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO. PAYING FOR THAT H. D. CHANNEL ACCESS IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH I MEAN VIRTUALLY ALL THE PICKCENTER IN THIS. HAVE THE FIVE CONNECTION OR SOME KIND OF ADEQUATE CA. THIS BY TO THE EARLY DAYS OF PUBLIC ACCESS TELEVISION. UN VAN VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE ACCESS CENTERS ARE HAVE MASTER CONTROL CENTER. LAYING OUT H. DEPROGRAMMING- I KNOW IN THE CASE OF COMCAST WHEN THEY DID ARE THEY REPLACED OUR CODERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THAT WAS FOR THEIR BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING THEIR OWN NETWORK MORE EFFICIENT- I YOU KNOW THE ENGINEER I SPOKE TO HE SAID THEY WERE DOING THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOW THE- COMCAST FRANCHISE. SO THE ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE ON ON IN THAT CASE OF COMCAST IS A SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION SOMEBODY ASSISTED DOWN FLIP THE SWITCH- OTHER OTHER CABLES. UPPER IN OPERATORS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS BUT- IN OUR CASE THAT'S WHAT IT IS ONE ONE OTHER QUICK OBSERVATION IS THAT ARGUABLY DIFFICULT ALREADY REQUIRES THE CABLE OPERATORS TO PROVIDE THAT THAT CONNECTION FROM THE CITY HALL OR FROM THE COMMUNITY MEDIA CENTER. TO THEIR HEAD AND- HUB SITE OKAY SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. IN ORDER YET AND AS MICHAEL HAS SAID. THAT CONNECTION I MEAN IS ALREADY. IN PLACE OKAY. IT'S NOT LIKE A NEW CONNECTION HAS TO BE BUILT IF THEY CHOOSE TO UPGRADE IT THAT'S THE CABLE OPERATORS THIS IS TREASON. ABSOLUTELY THEY HAVE THAT BUSINESS TRIPS BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE A NEW LINE HAS TO BE BUILT. OKAY AS MICHAEL HAS THEIR OWN WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE IT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND I DO HAVE A CLIENT ONE FOLLOW UP SURE AND NOTICED- I WOULD I WOULD LOVE SOME CLARITY ON NOT BECAUSE AND MY- ALL MY EXPERIENCE YOU DO HAVE TO UP. IT FIGHTER FIBER YOU WANT TO BE. A IS. STERN EVER AS OUR THERE ACTUALLY THE APELO CHANNELS THAT WE- TOOK MORE BAND THAN THE KERR. AGE DID CHANNEL SO AND LAST ALL AT. IS THIS THE A- VAST SHOULD BE SHOULD WE READ YEAH. OKAY THIS. I'M THE ONE SENT A MAN TO DO. OKAY NO. YEAH THE WAS OUR THERE THIS IS A- PUBLIC AT.

I'M SORRY NO OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HEAD I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR ON THE RECORD BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL KIND OF TOUCHED ON SO WHAT YOU ARE TELLING US IS THAT THIS ONE WILL NOT INCREASE COST TO THE CONSUMERS.

LOW MAIENSCHEIN RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I WRITE ABOUT IS NO BY ABOUT IS NO DOCTOR WEBER. DOCTOR WHAT WEBER YES AND I. ON THIS BILL WILL REMAIN ON CALL THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO TO OUR NEXT AUTHOR HERE- IS NUMBER FOUR AB. TWO TWO FIVE TWO. THANK YEAH IT WAS. SO YEAH FINANCIAL AID OUT OF THE. WILL BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO WHICH REQUIRES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO COLLECT INFORMATION A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS BILL. THE WILDFIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAUSED MASSIVE DEVASTATION FROM PROPERTY LOSS TO TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK DAMAGE MANY PEOPLE REPORT THEIR MOBILE PHONES WENT DARK AND INTERNET SERVICE WENT OUT AT CELL TOWERS WERE DAMAGED AN UNDERGROUND FIBER LINES BURNED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AN ONLINE SURVEY SURVEY FOUND THAT COUNTIES WILDFIRE WHAT WILDFIRES AFFECTED AREAS LOUT THEY LOST LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE GLASS FOR A REPORTED DAMAGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. DISRUPTIONS IN PHONE SERVICE IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES THE STUDENT PEERS C. HAVE FOOTBALL FOCUSED HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION EVEN TODAY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT THESE NATURAL DISASTERS OF HAD ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COME COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. CONCRETE RECOVERY PLANS ARE NOT SHARED WITH THE P. YOU SEE OR THE LEGISLATURE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO OVERSEE THESE COMPANIES AND REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST WE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENTS ARE HELPING IN THE REPAIR EFFORTS AND NOT IMPEDING THE RESTORATION. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO REQUIRES THE PC T COLLECT INFORMATION TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER EMERGENCIES OR DID THE OR DISASTERS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS BILL. THE BILL'S REQUIRED REPORTING IS NOT MANDATED TO BE SUBMITTED DURING THE EMERGENCY THEMSELVES. BUT IT IS INSTEAD A LOOK BACK TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR WORKING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN THE SHORT TERM DURING EMERGENCIES AND APPROPRIATE SERVICE TO SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES. AFTER DISASTER IS IN THE FOR THE LONG TERM. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT STATE REGULATORS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE INFORMED OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FAILURES. AND NETWORK DAMAGE AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER WITHOUT INFORMATION REGARDING THE METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED TO REBUILD THERE IS NO WAY TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME IMPROVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE NETWORK. FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS RELIABLE VOICE TELEPHONE ERVICE IS NECESSARY TO REACH NINE ONE ONE WITHOUT IT THE ABILITY TO ACT EMERGENCY SERVICES THIS LIMITED LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ARE NOT CO HERNANDEZ AND REGINA COSTA. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON VIRGIN ACOSTA I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BROADBAND SERVICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO SHARP RELIEF BY BOTH THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE MANY DECLARED DISASTERS EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LAST YEAR THE C. P. U. E. REQUIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSED BY DECLARED DISASTERS INCLUDING THE DAMAGE TO THE NETWORKS AND THE STEPS TAKEN TO REPAIR OR REBUILD. THE CPUC ACTION ADDRESSED MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF A PRIOR BILL AB ELEVEN HUNDRED THE CPUC DECISION HIGHLIGHTS THE DESIRE TO ENSURE DATE ACTION AND REVIEW OF SERVICE OUTAGES HOWEVER BECAUSE THE DECISION DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY REFERENCE BROADBAND WE CAN ENVISION SOME CONFUSION ON WHICH PROVIDERS AND WHICH SERVICES ARE COVERED. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT ANY ENTITY PROVIDING BROADBAND WILL HAVE TO REPORT OUTAGE AND RESTORATION INFORMATION IF THE BROADBAND SERVICE IS AFFECTED AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO HAS THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE CPUC REPORT THIS INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THERE IS OTHER DATA COLLECTION UNDERTAKEN BY CAL OUTAGES IN REAL TIME TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF EMERGENCY OFFICIALS THE ACTION REQUIRED BY AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO SO. VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO CAL- YES ARE FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATE SAFETY AND PROVIDING INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY. OFFICIALS ON THE SPOT FOCUSED ON SAFETY AND RESTORATION OF SERVICES WEAVING ANY COMMUNITY BEHIND FOLLOWING A DISASTER RELATED OUTAGE ONLY EXACERBATES ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THE REPORT WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMISSION WITH A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE ON THE RELIABILITY OF BROADBAND FOR ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP INSURE THAT NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND IF THEY'RE BROADBAND FACILITIES OR DESTROYED. DURING A DISASTER WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF THE COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE WHICH ENCOMPASSES CALIFORNIA NEVADA AND HAWAII WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE MEASURE. LET ME JUST FOCUS ON THE PART ABOUT THE LOOK BACK AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO RECEIVE INFORMATION NOT ONLY ABOUT OUTAGES BUT ABOUT WHAT STEPS WERE TAKEN. AND WHETHER WE'RE SUCCESSFUL AND RISK AVERSE TO ALL COMMUNITIES THIS LEGISLATORS WORK VERY DILIGENTLY AS YOU KNOW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS O INVEST IN BROADBAND EXPANSION AND INCREASE ACCESS WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT OF A LOT OF A DISASTER WHERE THE NETWORKS ARE DOWN AND HAVE TO BE REBUILT AND YET WE ARE NOT AWARE WHETHER ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE THEIR SERVICE RESTORED IN A WAY THAT WILL BE SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM. THAT IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH THERE CAN BE A GAP IN SERVICE AND LACK OF ACCESS WITH THIS BILL WILL DO WELL WILL ENSURE. THAT THE COMMISSION ON ANNUAL BASIS WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANIES THAT BROADBAND SERVICE WAS RESTORED HOW WAS RESTORED AND HOW IT WILL REMAIN. ACCESSIBLE TO ALL COMMUNITIES THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE DISASTER AND THERE WOULD ALSO BE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ABOUT ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN YOUR DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. I'VE HEARD TOO MANY TIMES IN LEGISLATORS LEGISLATIVE STAFF WHEN THESE DISASTERS HAPPEN THAT THEY'RE CALLING THEIR FRIENDS THEIR LOBBYIST THEIR CONTACTS AT THE COMPANIES TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED NOT ONLY IN REAL TIME BUT LONG TERM WHEN THEY HEAR STORIES FROM CONSTITUENTS TO SAY. NO ACTUALLY IT TOOK US A MONTH LONGER THAN EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY GOOD OR SERVICE RESTORED WE SHOULD NOT BE ADDRESSING THE INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE A VERY SUSTAINED OPERATIONAL WAY TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL GET THIS INFORMATION TO THE COMMISSION. AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE INFORMATION IS THE PURPOSE THAT- YEAH- THE COURT REQUIREMENTS- YES FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE PROUDEST. TO BE A CO SPONSOR ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WILL. DO WE HAVE ANY BY IN. THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO JOIN IN SUPPORT. I DO WE HAVE ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO VOICE OPPOSITION. WELL I'M SURE MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION THIS IS A SONG WE HEARD BEFORE. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON NETWORK OUTAGES AND RESTORATION TO PC ADOPTED A VERY SIGNIFICANT RESILIENCY DECISION THAT MAPPING OF OUTAGES MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE PROPER INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOU NEED FOR THIS THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON A BROADBAND SERVICE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE HAVE DONE THIS MAJOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND CONTINUE TO DO WORK ON OUR BACKUP POWER FOR THOSE CONNECTIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT SENATOR CORKER TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE SO YOU HAD SB SIX SEVENTY SB THREE FORTY ONE SB SIX SEVENTY AS YOU HEARD WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT NGUYEN WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES OF AN OUTAGE. A MAJOR OUTAGE THAT WE HAVE TO NOTIFY CAL OH YES OF THAT OUTAGE AND WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW EVERY THIRTY MINUTES WHAT IS THE PROGRESS OF OUR RESTORATION AND THEN WE HAVE TO LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S BEEN FULLY RESTORED WITH THE FINAL REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS ONLY SHARED WITH FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE IT'S DEALING WITH EMERGENCIES THE SITUATION SO. THE P. YOU SEE HAS A RESILIENCY CAL OH YES HAS A RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER. THIS BILL IS SAYING WE WANT THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE BY DISASTER BY WHAT HAPPENED SPECIFIC AND SO THAT'S INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS. BUT SO WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THE END THAT REPORT HAS TO BE MADE PUBLIC. IN THIS AGE OF- ESPIONAGE ON ONLINE AT THIS IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW IF I WAS RUSSIA BELARUS AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW CAN I TAKE DOWN COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND- THE FIFTH LARGEST COUNTY WERE. ONLY GOING TO DO IS SIGN UP FOR THE PC- DISTRIBUTION OF DE. DANIEL HOW DOES REPORT AND I GOT IT RIGHT THERE SO THIS IS VERY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS PROVIDED TODAY TO THE PC AGAIN FOR INVESTMENTS IN RESILIENCY AND TO CAL OH YES. FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE REAL TIME SITUATION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THIS INFORMATION AND WHAT CAN PUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC REALM. THAT'S OUR QUESTION FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSE. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES IF WE HAVE ANYBODY CALLING IN FOR SUPPORT. EMBLAZONED GERMAN IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME WE DO HAVE TO IN OUR QUEUE. WE'LL START WITH NUMBER TWENTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY RYAN WITH THE BRO CARE REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. NEXT UP IS NUMBER FORTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME STAND AND AREA. CENTER VALLEY AND ALSO- TECHNICIAN- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE CAN ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT WORK OR OPPOSE. AND YOUR ORGANIZATION- YEAH OH I'M SORRY YEAH YES SORRY THANK YOU SPORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK. ANY OTHER SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE. AND DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ON THE LINE SAID OPPOSITION. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. ONE ZERO PROPOSITION. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN OUR QUEUE. WITHOUT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL I THINK- IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A BODY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. DISCERN INTENT FROM ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS- ELEMENTS THE PROVISION OF SUCH AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES BROADBAND SERVICE SO I APPRECIATE- THAT THE PUSH TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY A IN UNDERSTANDING OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY. MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS AND SO I THINK WHAT WE WILL DO WITH IT IS LEGISLATE AND INSURE AND OVERSIGHT WHICH IS THAT RESPONSIBILITY- AND AUTHORITY OF THIS BODY SO THANK YOU AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU SO. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL FORD OVERSEE. COMMUNICATION IS KEY ESPECIALLY DURING A DISASTER RESPONSES FROM TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE NECESSARY SERVICE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE ARE SO I CAN DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY JUST THE PAST COUPLE DAYS IF YOU LOOK IN THE NEWS. THE U. S. WARNS COMPANIES TO STAY ON GUARD FOR POSSIBLE RUSSIAN CYBERATTACKS RUSSIA MAY TARGET US BUSINESSES WITH CYBER ATTACKS- THREAT LOOMS A RUSSIAN ATTACK ON UNDERSEA CABLES AND SHUT DOWNS ON ON THE WEST INTERNET. SO WHAT IN THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT SECURE THAT'S IN THE WERE NOT WEAKENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURES BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE BEING TARGET TARGETED. SO IT IS A GRAVE CONCERN OF MINE THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY WEAKENING OUR SYSTEM WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE. VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THEN IN CYPRUS. IN THE SECURE OF ALL OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS I THINK OUR- FRONT OF EVERYONE'S MIND. BUT THIS BILL HAS A PROVISION TO KEEP THE INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. THE C. P. C. RECEIVES A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT MANY THINGS INCLUDING THE ELECTRICAL GRID. INCLUDING ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND AS AN AGENCY THEY ARE BASS THEIR VAST EXPERIENCE. IN MAKING SURE THAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS NOT RELEASED. THE SAME TIME OUTAGES HOW MUCH HIGHER LEVEL REPORTED TO THE SEC THAT REPORTED STILL TAKES PLACE. IN A TREATED WITH CONFIDENTIALITY WHEN THEY NEED TO. THE COMMISSION IS WELL POSITIONED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING POSES A SECURITY RISK AND THAT IS BUILT INTO THIS BILL. AND THERE WOULDN'T BE THROUGH A REQUEST OF THE PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUEST YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SECURE THAT INFORMATION FIFTY THAT THE COMMISSION TOOK A LOOK AT THIS INCIDENTS IT WE SHOULDN'T RELEASE INFORMATION YOU COULDN'T GET IT THROUGH. THE REQUEST. FOR IT IF THE VERY BRIEF M. FEMEI MADAM CHAIR- ON THAT WE DID TAKE LANGUAGE AS WAS STATED WE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE OKAY SAY PUBLICLY WITH EIGHTEEN T. WHO WAS OPPOSED TO A- SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY INFORMATION- LANGUAGE WAS NICE AND TIGHT AND- PIGGYBACKED ON THE EXISTING PROCEDURES AT AT THE CQC AND SO THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WORKED ALSO WITH LET'S COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DID IN A WAY. THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT- ACOSTA JUST ADDRESS THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THOSE WILL APPLY TO THIS BILL AS WELL. AND DOES THE- UP. HOW AND- TO ADD ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD PUT US INTO- IT WE CAN- CREATE A SECURITY THREAT. BUT THE PROOF'S IN THE PUDDING IT'S THIS IS A PUBLIC REPORT AGAIN SO. YOU'RE GONNA BE DO A PUBLIC REPORT BY DISASTER BY IMPACTS OVER AT THE C. THE SPONSOR SAY NO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT TO BE BY A MEANS THAT THE BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC ON WHAT WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. TO BE MADE AVAILABLE SO AND I GUESS UNTIL WE SEE ONE OF THESE REPORTS AGAIN. WHY WOULD YOU WANNA PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THE IMPACTS- TO OUR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. FOR OTHERS TO LEARN FROM SO THIS THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING BE IT THE PC. HAS DISCRETION ON WHAT IT BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED. IT'S TO WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WE OFTEN DISAGREE WITH THEM ON THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION TODAY. SO BUT IT'S AT LEAST IT'S A VENUE FOR EXPRESSING OUR CONCERNS BUT ULTIMATELY IN THE END THE PEACE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. THANK YOU SO IS THERE- MAYBE WITH- DON'T HAVE THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT IT'S STATES HERE THE BILL WHAT AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION PUBLIC CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMISSION'S PROCEDURES SO DOES THAT NOT MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE PUBLIC. IF IT UP REMONSTRATING I THINK THE PROCESS WOULD BE KIND OF BOILED DOWN IS THE INFORMATION BE PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION AND IT WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC PURSUANT TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE CPC SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR PROCESS DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE- WITH HELP FROM THE PUBLIC OKAY SO THERE IS NOT A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED. YET AGAIN I'M SORRY MANAGER IF YOU COULD. OKAY I GUESS OF MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE WAS LANGUAGE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH EIGHTEEN T. LAST YEAR WE MADE SURE TO PUT IT IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THE CPC'S PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT INFORMATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE MADE PUBLIC OR KEPT FROM THE PUBLIC THAT THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL SOME PERMISSION FIRST GO TO THE COMMISSION. WOULD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC UNTIL THE CQC REVIEWED THE INFORMATION AND DETERMINE WHETHER SOME OF IT SHOULD BE WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC SO THAT DETERMINATION THAT FILTER WILL TAKE PLACE BEFORE ANY INFORMATION IS MADE PUBLIC OKAY THAT'S A CONFIDENTIALITY. ANYBODY ON THE SIDE MEMBERS ANY OTHER MEMBERS. JUST A QUICK NOTE SO JUST TO MAKE IT I KNOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BY CONCERN IS THAT- THIS WOULD GO AT ULTIMATELY IT COULD GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC SO IT WOULD BE OPEN IN THE AIR THERE AFTER YOU KNOW GOES FIRST RESPONDERS AND IT GOES TO LEGISLATORS BUT IT IS THERE POSSIBILITY IT'S REALLY JUST DETERMINES PEACE CAN YOU SEE DECIDES THEY WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE TO THE PUBLIC CORRECT. THE VERY SPECIFIC- REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMISSION HAS TO FOLLOW PERCENT TO STATUTE- IS IT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE SAME THE SAME TYPE OF CONFIDENTIALITY ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED AND RISK PUBLIC SAFETY RISK THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE ELECTRICAL GRID AND OTHER THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT THE COMMISSION USER BE THAT SAME PROCESS THAT WOULD BE USED SO WE FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT BECAUSE THOSE THINGS KIND OF WORK NOW THE FOR THIS CRAP KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WE THINK IT'LL BE EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU. OUR WE HAD A MO. AND A SECOND. I'M GONNA ASK YOU HAVE ANY- CLOSING REMARKS BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE READ THE REMARKS I WILL JUST SAY. ALL OF OUR PUBLIC INFORMATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE. OUT IN THE PUBLIC EVEN CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME. BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS DOES THAT MEAN WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD ON SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT- PARTICULARLY IN THESE AREAS THAT WE HAVE SEEN DISASTER AFTER DISASTER. I MEAN WE ARE NOT- WHETHER THERE'S A THREAT FROM RUSSIA WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CLIMATE ISSUES SO WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST WE CAN. WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAVE. TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS HEALTH SYSTEMS BROADBAND. EVERYTHING WE HAVE A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO- MOVE FORWARD SO WITH THAT WE HAD A- MOTION I DON'T.
