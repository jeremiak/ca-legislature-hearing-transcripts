MANY OTHER PRISONS WERE BUILT MORE THAN FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS AGO. WHEN THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED. REVOCATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES WERE NOT CRITICAL FACTORS THE FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON SECURITY. AND SECURITY ONLY. AND THEY COULD LATER WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND SUBSTANCE USE ORDER THIS SORT OF TREATMENT IN ADDITION TO THE KERRY. IN OUR PRISONS WERE NOT BUILT TO PROTECT STAFF OR PRISONERS AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THE CURRENT REDUCTION OUR PRISON POPULATION WHICH IS FEWER THAN NINETY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN THREE DECADES ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO TRULY FOCUS AND LEVERAGE ITS INVESTMENTS DURING.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS DEAN MORGAN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION- WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE ONE AND THE OTHER ISSUES ON THE AGENDA THIS AFTERNOON- AS- A AS MENTIONED. THERE WAS A SIMPLE LITTLE REPORT LANGUAGE- THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH THE- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET UP FROM LAST YEAR THAT REQUESTED THE DEPARTMENT TO OPERATE A PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE RECRUITMENT STRATEGY. AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. MEET WITH. THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM ANDERSON SENATE COLLEAGUES- LAST WEEK TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER. I AM RESPONSIBLE MEETING- WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE- IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY THAT WAS REQUESTED THROUGH THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE. AND BEING ABLE TO MEET THE DEADLINE OF THE SUPPLEMENT REPORT LANGUAGE- JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THIS REPORT WILL I BE ABLE TO LOOK BEYOND THE FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME THAT I HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. WE WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM- TEN YEAR A LOOK AT OUR PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS IS REQUESTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL LANGUAGE- ONE OF THE REPORT. WILL ALSO INCLUDE NARRATIVE TO DESCRIBE HOW. WOULD PLAN TO PROVIDE A THOROUGH AND FLEXIBLE. ALL PRESENT THIS. ARE LOOKING AT TEN AND THE FUTURE. SO I HAVE AS MENTIONED- WE ARE ON SOME. THAT OUR PARTICULAR. OF THE REPORT AND- LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THAT. WITH THE-I COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE OTHER A. O. FIRST WEEK OF MARCH AND- CAN TO THEIR- FROM THAT POINT. FOR HERE'S IN MAKING PRISON CLOSURE- DECISIONS. AND OTHER BUNDLES THERE SIX ITEMS SPECIFICALLY LISTED IN THAT REPORT IT INCLUDED THE COST OPERATE AT THE FACILITY WORKFORCE IMPACTS THE STAFF- SOME POPULATION AND GENDER SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS. DURABILITY OF STATE SOLUTION OVERCROWDING PUBLIC SAFETY RECALL PATIENT AND A FINAL ITEM BESIDES THOSE FIVE I'M LOOKING AT LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND- INCLUDING PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS IN THOSE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. SO DURING OUR TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT USE THE THAT THOSE GUIDELINES CRITERIA EVALUATED- THOSE FACTORS FOR WRITING PERSONS. AND IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ANNOUNCED THAT THAT THEY DO WILL OCCASIONAL INSTITUTION NEAR TRACY WOULD BE CLOTHING AND THE CLOSURE DATE IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THIS YEAR. MY COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY GOT THE WARDEN INVESTED SOME OF HIS LEADING CDCR SEPARATES RELATED TO THIS CLOSURE AND HELP PROVIDE BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE CLOSURE. AND THE CURRENT ACTIVITY. PLANNING FOR DVRS CLOVER. YEAH ADVANCED FROM SILOS CALIFORNIA APARTMENT CHRISTIAN SHE KEPT WATER- AND SHE OF THE MEMBER. SO AT YOU. GONNA GO EIGHTEEN. THAT APARTMENT I WENT ON A PRETTY EXTENSIVE- SORRY. BOB WE INITIATED. REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION OUT OF STATE SO ALL OF THAT OF THE PRISON POPULATION WAS BROUGHT BACK TO CALIFORNIA WE NOW CLOSE ALL PRIVATE LEE CONTRACTED IN STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WILL CLOSE TWO OUT OF THREE PUBLIC CONTRACTED CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND STATE WITH THE THIRD PLAN ON A CLOSURE IN MAY SO WITH THE NATURAL PROGRESSION PERCENT A LOT EIGHTEEN WE DESIGNATED OKAY SUBSTITUTION AS THE FIRST INSTITUTION OF CLOTHES- WE NOW SEPTEMBER. IT'S ON TRACK RIGHT NOW TO CLOSE SEPTEMBER. THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ON- THERE'S- SAVINGS A HUNDRED FOR MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WITH ADDITIONAL SAVINGS OF A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE HAD OVER NINE HUNDRED SEVEN FIVE POSITIONS WILL BE REDUCED AS PART OF THIS CLOSURE. ARE CURRENTLY THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED INMATES AT THE LOCATION STATION THAT WILL REQUIRE TRANSFER SO THE IN. HE DIDN'T INSTITUTION IS ACTIVELY. THE TRANSFER THOSE INMATES WE ARE TRYING TO RESCHEDULE ALREADY PLANNED OUT. IT'S GOING TO START UP WILL GRADUALLY AND THAT'LL SPEED UP THROUGH THE SPRING MONTHS ALREADY THE SUMMER. AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE ON TRACK FOR THAT. THAT'S SMALL REDUCTION AGREEMENT POPULATION ACTUALLY THE CLOSURE. I DON'T. SO ALSO THERE ARE AT CHANGE FROM INMATES WILL GET CARDS WITH THE CODE CAUTIONS THAT THOSE THERE'S A PRETTY FOURTEEN PRE TRANSFER ARE G. ISOLATION OF THE TEST EIGHTY NINE THAT'S WHERE THE TRANSFER- THAT HR PROCESS ARE UNDERWAY THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN NOTICED WE'VE ENGAGED WITH COUNTY CHAR AND THE UNIONS WE'VE ENGAGED ON OUR- INITIAL NEGOTIATIONS- WE'VE PROPOSED A VOLUNTARY TRANSFER PROCESS. TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON THE IN THE INSTITUTION STAB WOUNDS SO ARE JANET TRY TO REDUCE OUR STAFF WILL BE IMPACTED DURING THE LAYOUT PROCESS- IN THE PARKING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN COUNTY. SO WE'RE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE'S WITH THE UNION REGARDING THAT- WE'VE IMPLEMENTED. A HIGH RESTRICTIONS STATE. THE HELP LOCATE AND LOOK FOR TO BE PLACED OUT- INCLUDING THE REGIONAL AREA A SIGNIFICANT HI RESTRICTION GUNS BEEN AFFECT FOR QUITE SOMETIME TRY TO OPEN UP THE AREA WITHIN ABOUT NINETY MILE RADIUS OF THE END OF OUR NEW LOCATIONS DIVISION. AND THERE ARE TEN STATIONS UP ALL WITHIN THAT RADIUS WHICH GIVES US A LOT OF ROOM FOR STAFF PLACEMENTS WHICH TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT AND IF THERE ARE ANY LAOS. IT'LL BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE- I MYSELF FOR WORKING KIDS. AND THAT'S ONLY MANAGEMENT. WHAT WE'RE NEEDING TO ACTUAL INSTITUTION CALL YOUR EVERYTHING FROM DISPOSAL AND TRANSFER I'M A QUICK MAN- THE- GERMANS ARE BEING REGION'S. WELL WE'RE- GONNA GIVE NOTICE TO THE CAN A LIVE STAGE HOUSING THERE'S ON A HOUSING OKAY SO FROM THE WHOLE INSTITUTIONS AND THE OLDER INSTITUTIONS HAVE ON STATE HOUSING WE HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE IS TENANTS- AND THEN EVENTUALLY I WILL WOK OUR WAY DOWN CLOSING HOUSING UNITS AND FACILITATING. THE CLOSURE. I'M NOT. THAT'S RIGHT OR THE COVER. THANK THE CALL YOU WILL THANK YOU. BUT IS THE VERY BRIEF THERE TO MORE I- AND ISSUE ONE THAT I'D LIKE MAKE A FEW ON- IN ADDITION TO THE CLOSURE OF PART PART OF THE CULTURAL OR IDLE ISSUE INSTITUTION THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTING- WARM SHUT DOWN RESOURCES- IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR WOULD BE ONE POINT SIX MILLION. YOUR IMPACT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS TWO POINT TWO MILLION. THIS FUNDING. FUNDING FOR A 12-1 A- BE WISE AT DVR. LITTLE SHUT DOWN PROGRAM A DVR SIMILAR TO THE WARM SHUT DOWN THE WE PERFORM A DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES THAT WOULD CLOSE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS- THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE A VERY SMALL STAFF. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT- ON THE AIR HANDLING UNITS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THAT REMAIN OPERATIONAL. MAINTAINS THE VALUE OF THE ASSET FOR FUTURE DISPOSITION- SMALLER PRODUCTS WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF- DV I ALSO HAS  VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF BROWN'S SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE KEEP OUR WEED ABATEMENT AND OTHER THINGS- IN CONTROL THERE- WILL HAVE A CONTRACTED SECURITY SERVICE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OFF HOURS IT'S NOT ON ANY DAY- CORRECTIVE ON TOP AND IT PROACTIVE FOR VANDALISM- AND LIKE I SAID THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OTHER CLOSURES THAT APARTMENT IS DONE. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I WILL ALSO BE WORKING ON THE PART OF THE GENERAL SERVICES THE PLANNING FOR THE EVENTUAL SALE OR TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY- WHAT ARE EXPERIENCING WELL NOW WITH THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE PROPERTIES. IS THAT FINAL SAILOR TRANSFER CAN TAKE SOME TIME- IN DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME CDCR REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOCATION SO AS I MENTIONED THE SECURITY MANAGING WE GROWTH. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T PROVIDING A NEW SENSE OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT'S A WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING THESE RESOURCES FOR- ALSO NOTETHAT PTI HAS FIVE TIMES THE BUILDING SQUARE FOOTAGE ATTHE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. AND SIX TIMES THE EIGHT IT ALSO WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. SO I COMPARISON TO THE AMOUNT OF- WARM SHUTDOWN STAFFING THAT THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FACILITY IS. NOT EXACTLY APPLES TO APPLES. IN THE ABSENCE OF I. HER MAKE THIS BRIEF- ONE FINAL ITEM S. DO WITH THE ACT THE- PROPOSED REQUEST. FOR SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION OR SO. HEALTHCARE HAVE BECOME READ. CENTER DOWN IN NORTH- THE IS BECAUSE IT NO. LARGE SCALE HEALTHCARE. IN PROJECT THERE WAS DONE IN NORTON NEW CAN- THERE. SO THAT. PARTNERED WITH. S. AND IN PART. UNDER THE RISKY OFFICE AND- CAL. PERSONAL HEALTH CARE. TO IDENTIFY A LOT OF REPAIRS TO THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE SPACES. WILL HELP IMPROVE HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION INFECTION CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH CARE- OF FACTORS. THESE REPAIRS WILL OCCUR ON A PHASED BASIS. WITH SEGMENTS WAITING FOR OCT TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND. BEING FULLY COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE ANALYSIS RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHY WE WOULD PROPOSAL. FOR C. R. C. WHEN I A POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY CLOSE AND SERVE ANOTHER CLOSURE CAN BE ANNOUNCED BY THE DEPARTMENT. WE FEEL THAT'S IMPORTANT REVIEW THE REQUIREMENTS OF PEOPLE CO TWO OH SIX SEVEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IN A LOOK AT THIS REPORT THROUGH THE LENS OF A REASONS WHY A PERSON MAY BE LIKELY TO REMAIN OPEN RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT IT AS A REASON WHY A PERSON MIGHT BE LIKELY TO CLOSE. THE CRC FACILITIES IN A RELOCATION. THAT MAKES A GOOD FOR VISITATION OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION IT MAKES IT EXCELLENT FOR RECRUITING AND THAT'S FOR ALL TYPES OF STAFF PERSONAL STAFF AND HEALTHCARE STAFF. WILL WORK NUMBER OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AT CRC AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL COLLEGE PROGRAMS. THESE ARE THE FACTORS THAT HELP WAS MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF SEASHORE'S MISSION THAT ANY ONE OF OUR PRISONS- STAFF AND- PARTNERS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES IN ORDER TO HELP INCARCERATED PROF POPULATION PREPARE OR RETURN TO SOCIETY. IF THE PRESIDENT MEETS THIS CRITERIA THEN IF THEY'RE GONNA BE STRONG CONSIDERATION FOR THE PRISONS STATE OPEN WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER REASONS WHY IT MIGHT BE CNSIDERED FOR CLOSURE. SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY TO BE HONEST THE APARTMENT IS PUT FORWARD THE REQUEST. FOR HEALTHCARE YOU CAN CRC- NO IT WAS TALKING FAST- BUT DON'T WANT TO GET THROUGH A LOT OF THAT ISSUE. WE APPRECIATE THE LINE AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE COMMITTEE HAVE FROM. THANK YOU FOR THE APARTMENT OF MY- FIVE ANYTHING TO. ADMISSION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. WHAT ABOUT THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DO HAVE COMMENTS ON THE THREE ITEMS WITH IT- THREE ITEMS WITHIN THIS ISSUE I'LL START WITH THE CLOSURE OF DV I HAVE ARE WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT TOPIC. THE FIRST IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE CLOSURE GIVEN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO ADJUST THAT ESTIMATE AT THE ME REVISED WHEN IT HAS MORE INFORMATION AT THAT TIME. A SECOND WE THINK THAT THE TWELVE POSITIONS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THE WEREN'T SHUT DOWN OF THE FACILITY APPEAR EXCESSIVE. GIVEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY USES ONLY TWO POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE WARM SHUT DOWN OF ANOTHER PERSON THAT'S CURRENTLY CLOSED- WELCOME KNOWLEDGE THAT DVI IS A LARGER FACILITY- AND WOULD PROBABLY NEED MORE THAN TWO RESOURCES. ARE TWO POSITIONS. FOR ITS MORE SHUT DOWN THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE FULL TWELVE POSITIONS IN OTHER WORDS WHY IT NEEDS A FULL SIX TIMES- WHAT IT USES TO SUPPORT ANOTHER PERSON. WE THINK FIVE POSITIONS WOULD BE REASONABLE SO WE RECOMMEND. REJECT SEVEN POSITIONS- WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE REQUEST BY EIGHT SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. THIRD THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF DV I AND THE SECOND POSITION AT PRESENT NOT SCHEDULE SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME SO IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE WILL SELL THOSE FACILITIES. AND THEREFORE ELIMINATING THE NEED TO FUND THE WARM SHUT DOWN OR SELL CONTINUE TO BE A STATE NEED FOR THEM SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE- DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT TO REPORT. BY JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WHAT OPTIONS IT'S CONSIDERING FOR THE ALTERNATIVE DISPOSITION OF THOSE PRISONS- WE THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS AND GETTING THE BALL ROLLING UP ROLLING ON THAT DOING THAT THINKING WOULD HELP AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND THEREFORE UNNECESSARY SPENDING ON WARM. CHECK OUT. REGARDING THE PROPOSED A HEALTHCARE FACILITY REPAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO- THE PROJECT HE C. R. INDICATES THAT THE PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED AND TELLS. A FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND AT THAT POINT BASED ON CDC OURS OWN PROJECTIONS OF THE INMATE POPULATION IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE COULD BE IN A POSITION TO. BE CLOSING ITS THIRD PRISON FIVE FALL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT- C. OR C. MAY BE IN A GOOD LOCATION AND HAVE. SOME THINGS GOING FOR IT BUT- IT AT THIS POINT THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T PUT FORWARD A PLAN- TO ACT TO DEAL WITH THE FULL SCOPE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT C. OR C. SO. WE DON'T REGARD THAT AS A LONG TERM OR IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T REGARD- MINIMAL FIXES OR TEMPORARY. PATCHES ESSENTIALLY ON THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AT SEARS SEE WHICH IS WHAT IS PROPOSED EFFECTIVELY AS A LONG TERM. PLAN FOR THAT FACILITY. SO THEREFORE SO WE'RE CONCERNED IN OTHER WORDS THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE STATE COULD BE. YOU KNOW CLOSING HERE SEE BY THE TIME- THE WORK OR ALREADY BEFORE THE REPAIRS ARE COMPLETED WHICH WOULD OF COURSE NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL UNLESS THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE HELLO AND A LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW LITTLE ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND- ANY OTHER- CHALLENGES WITH OPERATING A FACILITY IN THE LONG TERM. AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE- IN OTHER WORDS. OR IN EITHER IN THE LONG TERM OR LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE. THE REPAIR IS WORTHWHILE ESSENTIALLY- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES RICK REJECT THIS PROPOSAL IT COULD RE REDIRECT THE RESOURCES TO OTHER HIGH PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT PERSON THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE CLOSED. AND THEN ON FINALLY ON THE BROADER ISSUE OF THE STATE SIGNIFICANT PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- AS NOTED IN YOUR GENDER AGENDA- WE HAVE RECOMMENDEDTHAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE. THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PERSON PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING A LIST OF THE SIGNIFICANT HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT THINKS IT WILL NEED. AT THIS POINT TO COMPLETE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THINGS OF COURSE MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE- WE ALSO THINK THAT THE REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED VARIOUS CRITERIA. IN SELECTING THESE PROJECTS- FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULD CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO. YOU KNOW NOT JUST REBUILD FACILITIES AS THEY ARE NOW BUT CONSIDER REDESIGNING THEM IN A WAY THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THAT BUT YOU KNOW OPERATIVE OPERATIONAL SAVINGS WORK- IMPROVED. SERVICES FOR INMATES OR PERHAPS CONSOLIDATING A WE'RE RELOCATING PRISONS- THE STATE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES AT IN TERMS OF HOW. THINKING CARE HOW MUCH. IT WANTS OR WHAT KIND OF TIME HORIZON IT WANTS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND TO PRESENT INFRASTRUCTURE- I JUST NOTE THOUGH THAT THE FOR THE FACT THAT THE PRISON IS. EXCUSE ME THE STATE IS PLANNING TO CLOSE TO PRISON THAN WE THINK BASED ON PROJECTIONS COULD BE IN A POSITION TO CLOSE THREE ADDITIONAL PRISONS. DOESN'T ISN'T BUT THE PRIMARY DRIVER BEHIND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY REPORT BUT REALLY THE OVERALL- SIGNIFICANT NEED AN INFRASTRUCTURE IS WHAT DRIVES THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR A PLAN. IN OTHER WORDS IF THE STATE WERE CLOSING ZERO PRISONS ARE FIVE PRESENTS IT STILL NEEDS TO- ASSESS HOW IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS. THIS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. THANK YOU AND HAVE TO TAKE. THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK- MISTER BOARD FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO GET US A PLAN AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH- HOPEFULLY THIRTY TWO SAID SOME LIGHT AND ANSWERS INTO SOME OF THE ALLEY OF COMMENTS. OUT THERE MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- I DID HAVE A QUESTION AS I LOOKED AT THE DATA AND THE POPULATION I'M BEING THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN THE LAST THREE. DECADES AND LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EMPTY BEDS- AND AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL CLOSURES OR AS THE L. A. O. SPEAKS ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL THREE CLOSER TH ON THE TWO THAT ARE PLANNED. OUT WHAT'S A COMFORTABLE CUSHION FOR EMPTY BEDS- FOR THE STATE TO MAINTAIN. BEFORE ANOTHER CLOSER CAN HAPPEN. MISTER MAYBE CDC ARE. CONDUCTED A PRESS- WELL I BEGINNING IN IN ANSWER- OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT IS DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW IS THE AFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN- ON OUR POPULATION AND OUR OPERATIONS AND- WITH THAT BERMAN HAS GONE TO ANY STANDARD OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING AS IT RELATES TO OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR HOUSING DECISIONS WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM. SO WE'RE CERTAINLY IN A IN A POSITION WHERE WE NEED TO- FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM GET GET TO THE NEXT- GET GET AROUND THE CORNER WELL WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO- LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE SO MUCH OF THE STATE NEEDS TO- WITH A VACCINATION STRATEGIES ANOTHER STRATEGIES- SO THAT WE CAN. GET BACK TO WHATOUR NEW NORMAL OPERATION IS GOING TO BE WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM I THINK THAT THOSE THINGS NEED TO OCCUR ALONG WITH THE CONTINUED REVIEW OF POPULATION TRENDS POPULATION PROJECTIONS IN ORDER TO GET TO A POINT WHERE- MORE THAN THE TWO PERSONS THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO CLOSING- CAN CAN BE LOOKED AT. THAT'S KIND OF IT IN A NUTSHELL I BELIEVE THE PARTNER FINANCE MIGHT HAVE. SOMETHING THAT. LENITION I DEPART OF IMPACTS. THANK YOU ADAM I WOULD ADD THAT CURRENTLY THERE IS ISOLATION SPACE THAT SATISFIED DUE TO KOBE THE IRA IN CASE ABOUT BREAKS AND THAT HAS REDUCED CAPACITY BY SEVERAL THOUSAND BEDS. AND THERE'S ALSO ROUTE WE'RE STILL EXPLORING THE FUTURE USE OF DORM BETH OUT WHICH IF THAT IS DISCONTINUED COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR CAPACITY BY SEVERAL THOUSAND MORE BAD. IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO SOME CONCERNS ABOUT LOOKING AT FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND THAT TO THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED. THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO RIGHT SIZING THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND THAT'S HOW STOP ALL MANNER AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT AYE AYE AYES AND TALKED ABOUT WE'VE REDUCED OUR CONTRACTED PRISON CAPACITY BESIDES. IT THE ARTISTIC PADS WERE TERMINATED IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SIX OF THE SEVEN IN THE STATE CONTRACTED BEDS HAVE BEEN. TERMINATED ON OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND THE BUDGET REFLECTS CLOSER OF THE FINAL AND STATE CONTRACT THAT HAD THE- VISIBILITY BY NAY OF TWENTY ONE. FOR WE HAVE COMMITTED AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CLOSING TWO PRESENTS- AS WE TALK ABOUT TV I AM TWENTY ONE AND A SECOND PERSON A TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND WHEN WE IDENTIFY DVI FOR CLOSER IT WAS THE HEAD OF THE OUR STATUTORY NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT AND WE'RE ON TRACK TO IDENTIFY THE SECOND PRESENT BY THAT JANUARY TWENTY. TO THE DEADLINE AS WELL THAT SAID WE BELIEVE IT'S STILL PREMATURE TO IDENTIFY THE TIMELINE FOR FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND THAT YOU. IT'S A MAJOR DECISION THAT HAS ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STAFF WHO WORK THERE THE INMATES HOUSED THERE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES. AND SO IT'S A PATH WE DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN UNTIL. RELATIVELY CERTAIN IT CAN BE COMPLETED. AND THERE'S NO OF FACTORS THAT REALLY PLANTED ABOUT ONE OF THOSE IS THE IMPACTS OF KOBE- LIKE I SAID THERE'S- CURRENTLY ISOLATION SPACE- AS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BRING THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL WITH OUR AGGRESSIVE TESTING PROTOCOLS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES BUT THE OVERALL TRAJECTORY WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM STILL REMAINS UNCERTAIN. THE SAFETY OF INMATES AND STAFF ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT PREMATURELY CONSOLIDATING ANY INSTITUTIONS. COURTS ARE WATCHING AND LOOKING OUT HOW THESE ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED LONG TERM AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THESE COMPLICATED LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AS WE CONSIDER FUTURE POTENTIAL PRISON CLOSURES. IN ADDITION IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT MAKING RELATIVELY PERMANENT DECISIONS LIKE CLOSING PRISONS BASED ON LONG TERM PROJECTIONS IS RISKY. CDCR GOOD AT OUR POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND ARE FAIRLY ACCURATE WITHIN A YEAR TO YOU USUALLY WITHIN A COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS WHICH IS USUALLY LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND INMATES MARGIN OF ERROR. HOWEVER THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO THERE IS A HIGHER MARGIN OF ERROR AND IT CAN BE 10215% OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND INMATES. AND THAT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT OF THE PRODUCTIONS BUT RATHER REFLECTION OF HOW THE POLICY CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS AND ILLUSTRATES WHY MAKING LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS. BASED ONLY ON MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS IS RISKY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE BELIEVE IT SO PREMATURE TO AND IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PRISON CONVERTERS BEYOND THIS YEAR. AT YOU FOR THAT I- TO SEE CLEAR. WE I WAS NOT ASKING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CLOSER EARTH ANYTHING THIS IS IN LINE WITH A THEY'RE ASKING FOR A TEN YEAR LONG TERM PLAN. THAT WILL HAVE MANY VARIABLES IS ONE OF THE MANY VARIABLES THAT WE THINK WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT DISCUSSION AND THOSE DECISIONS- AND SUCH AS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING SMART WHILE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE MERGER AND ERROR OF. THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION. AND I WANT TO BE REALISTIC THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A WHILE IT'S NOT GOING AWAY. RIGHT AWAY I ALSO WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THE ERROR OF NOT PLANNING ACCORDINGLY AND THEN HAVING TO RESPOND TO OUR VOTERS OF TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING WASTED. ALONG THE WAY AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS CLOSER IN OUR WE'VE INVESTED. RECENTLY CLOSE TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PERSON WAY ABOUT THE GROWTH. OUT THERE SO- DOES I THINK AT THIS POINT TO KEEPING THAT GOING TO GIVE ME A DIRECT ANSWER BUT- COME. EARLY MARCHING IN TO GIVE US A REPORT I HOPE THIS IS PART OF IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERED IN YOUR DEFENSE ANALYSIS OUT THERE. NOT WITH THAT I'M GOING TO PASS IT OVER TO MR LACKEY. WHO I KNOW HAD SOME QUESTIONS. YEAH JUST REAL. I I A PRE. THE INFORMATION AND SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT WAS EXPRESSED. ON NOW. WHAT IS CONSIDERED BEFORE THEY DO THE- THE SHUTDOWNS. BUT ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT YOU MENTIONED AND TRIGGERED A QUESTION MY MIND YOU TALKED ABOUT. LONG TERM INVESTMENT COSTS. AND LAST YEAR I TALKED ABOUT A PRISON THAT'S IN SUCH DEPLORABLE CONDITION. AND THAT WAS PLEASANT VALLEY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S PART OF THE CONSIDERATION. FOR THE SHUT DOWNS BUT- I I'M ASSUMING THAT- THE REPAIRS THAT. THAT PRISON NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE VERY VERY COSTLY. AND I JUST WONDERED IF THAT WAS. ONE OF THE STRONG CRITERIA BASED ON WHAT YOU SHARED WITH ME. WITH US WITH THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER WACKY. THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO DETER THE FACILITY POINTED BY THE RELEASE OF THE CLOSURE- ONCE SOMEONE HAS TO DO WITH INVESTMENTS HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE QUESTION OF LOOKING FORWARD AND SAYING WHAT A DIFFERENT REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED. AT THAT LOCATION. SO I THINK THAT THE THINGS. FOR I HAVE TO DO WITH THE FUTURE OF NEW FOR REPAIR- DECISIONS WILL PROJECT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED ALREADY THOSE DECISIONS WERE BASED FIVE TO SIX YEARS PREVIOUSLY- AND REALLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT PLEASANT VALLEY- WE HAVE. A COMPLETED. EVEN PROJECT A PLEASANT VALLEY WHERE ALL THE HOUSING UNITS. YOU MENTIONED HAVE BEEN REALLY FOR LEAKING CONDITION FOR NUMBER OF YEARS- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH ARE REGROUPING EVERYTHING ON HOUSING UIT- IN THE SUPPORT SPACES AT PLEASANT VALLEY SO IT ACTUALLY. IS IN A MUCH BETTER CONDITION TODAY THEN IT WAS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I'VE I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE SINCE I GOT ELECTED TWENTY TWELVE EFFECTIVE CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE. AND IT'S A DISCUSSION. THEN ABOUT A REPAIRING- PRISONS THAT HAVE COME TO THE END OF USEFUL LIFE THAT NEEDED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WITH A DISCUSSION ABOUT. POSSIBLY CLOSING OR BUILDING NEW ONES GOING TO A BOND. AND THE DEPARTMENT THEN WAS ASKED FOR SOME TYPE OF GENERAL OVERVIEW. OF THE FACILITIES TO CONDITIONS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO GO GET NEW FACILITIES. OR WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO SHUT SOME DOWN. THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED. ANY ANALYSIS FROM CDC ARE. EITHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO. EITHER'S BECAUSE THEY'RE INCOMPETENT WHY JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S DISAGREEMENT COLONEL PROBLEM WITH THIS THIS IDEA OF PROVIDING THE BEST FACILITIES FOR NOT ONLY TO PRISON GUARD TO THEIR BUT THE INMATES THAT ARE THERE. I WOULD SUGGEST MADAM CHAIR. THAT ANY COMPETENT REAL ESTATE COMPANY COULD GO INTO CDC OUR LOOK AT OUR FACILITIES AND MAP OUT A PLAN. OF HOW TRIED TO REHAB THE EXISTING FACILITIES SO THEY MEET THE STANDARDS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY IN THE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT. DISCOVER WHICH FACILITIES HAVE COME TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE. AND MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T INVEST IN FACILITIES. THAT WE MAY ULTIMATELY TEAR DOWN SELL OR ABANDON. I REMEMBER A MILLION DOLLAR KITCHEN THAT WOULD PEOPLE WANTED TO BUILD IN A IN A FACILITY THAT WAS RUN DOWN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE SAID NO TO. SALT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD STOP WAITING. STOP ALLOWING CDC ARE TO DRAG THEIR FEET ON THIS ISSUE. I WE OWE IT TO THE TAXPAYERS WILL TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THOSE BUILDINGS. TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF FACILITY THAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR WORK. AND IF WE HAVE TO TAKE OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIND AT FUNDING SO WE CAN DO IT OURSELVES WE SHOULD BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG RUN. WE WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE MAY ACTUALLY SAVE SOME LIVES IN BUILDINGS THAT MAY HAVE EXPRESSED THIS OR SOME OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INSIDE THEM. THAT WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD- THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'LL BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU. I AM TIRED OF WAITING THIS IS TIME THAT WE START MOVING ON THE STATE'S AND QUIT LISTENING TO. VETERANS CURRENTLY TRYING TO TELL US. THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT OR THEY CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO GET THIS DONE. THAT AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD BE TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. TO IT I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER INFO FOR THE DEPARTMENT- THIS THE URGENCY FOR THE INFORMATION AND SHARE WITH US NEXT WEEK IT'S BEEN LONG OVERDUE. MY MATH MYELITIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY QUESTIONS ARE AROUND THE LOOKED OF ALL FACILITY AND THE L. A. OWES A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE POSITION CUTS **** AND THIS IS TO THE DEPARTMENT FIRST WHAT IS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE WOMAN'S ARM FACILITY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT ARE THE TWO WHAT DO THE TWO POSITIONS AND NOT. FACILITY ACTUALLY DO. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- THE- CORPORATION OF THE BUILDING HAPPY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY IS THAT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET THE AMOUNT OF SQUARE FEET AT THE OLD LOCATION INSTITUTION IS MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION SQUARE FEET. SO THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY IS THAT IT IS THAT YOU SENT TO OPERATING FACILITIES IN STOCKTON ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY IS ADJACENT TO IT AND THE NORTHERN- CALIFORNIA YOUTH CORRECTIONAL CENTER IS ADJACENT TO OUR SO THERE ARE. ABILITIES TO HAVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE BETWEEN THOSE FACILITIES AND HELPING ANY- PREPARING NAMES ARE NOT BEING A STANDALONE FACILITY IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME. ISSUE OF GROUNDS- COVERAGE ON IN LIKE SAID IT'S MUCH SMALLER IT'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY ACRES COMPARED TO SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE ACRES SO THE PEOPLE AT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY PRIMARILY- KEEP THE MACHINERY. HANDLING IN ITS- AND OTHER ELECTRONICS OPERATING- AND THEN MANAGE CONTRACT WORK COMING IN THERE TO DO WEED CONTROL. AND OTHER ISSUES LIKE THAT. AND THE- MANY- POSITIONS NEEDED. FOR DEFAULT THIS POINT IS THE TWELFTH. TO RUN TO RUN- ONCE CLOSER. THAT IS THAT THAT'S OUR ANALYSIS UP AT THIS TIME- WE HAVE PERFORMED WE PUT TOGETHER WORK LOAD ANALYSIS ON I'M NOT CERTAIN IF IT IS GOING TO THE ONLY HOPE SO WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH THE ONLY- REGARDING THAT ONE THING I WOULD. POINT OUT IS THAT- DO ALL DOES HAVE AN OPERATING WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. AND THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE OPERATING ALTHOUGH AT A MUCH REDUCED CAPACITY BUT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE PLANS DO REQUIRE I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO GET MINIMUM OF TWO IT MIGHT EVEN BE THREE OF THOSE PAUL P. WISE OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER. PLANT WORKERS OBVIOUSLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT PENALIZED NEVER ASK FOR IT INTO W. OUT BECAUSE THERE'S A CERTAIN FUNDING INDIVISIBLE. UTILITIES OF THE CITY OF STOCKTON. THANK YOU. UGH THANK YOU FOR THAT DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ON THE FIRST ISSUE. MISTER CHANG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO GO THROUGH AND JUST DOUBLE. CHECK SOME OF JUST THE NUMBERS I GUESS IN THE DO YOU DO NOT HAVE THE- THE AYE OUR AGENDA BRIEF IN FRONT OF YOU. YEAH GREG ALLMAN. IT SAYS THAT ROUGHLY THE- OCCUPIED CAPACITY FOR THE PRISONS IS EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SIX SIX THREE ON PAGE TWO WITH A TOTAL OF NINETY FOUR THOUSAND ON PAGE. TO WITH IT BUT WHEN YOU ADD UP ALL THE ADDITIONAL. NUMBERS THAT. CORRECT. TO GET STARBURST I ASSUME IT IS PERHAPS WE'RE AT EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED I CONSTRUCTION POP AND ARE IN CUSTODY POP IS NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AS OF. TODAY I WOULD JUST WONDERING IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE L. L. HOUSE IN TERMS OF TWENTY TWENTY ACTUALS OF- BUT A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND. OF L. L. WANTS TO COMMENT. OUR SORRY MISTER KING WHAT WHICH- I'M LOOKING AT YOUR CHART REGIONAL PAVE PAGE FIVE OF OUR AGENDA IN MAY POPULATION AS OF AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH WITH YOUR PROJECTIONS OKAY POLITICS DECEMBER SO THESE ARE JUNE THIRTEEN POINT IN TIME NUMBERS. NINE AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION MEMBER ORGANIZATION SO THAT AND THEN WITH. THAT HAS SINCE COME DOWN YOUR SON. SO THE JUNE THIRTY NUMBER IS AN ACTUAL POPULATION. NUMBER THAT WE TOOK FROM CITY SHARES POPULATION REPORTS AS IN JUNE THIRTY. TWENTY TWENTY. AND TWO THAT THE NUMBERS LABEL LABELED PROJECTED ARE FROM TCRS MOST RECENT POPULATION PROJECTION REPORTS WHICH ARE ALSO JUNE THIRTY NUMBERS- AS WERE RELEASED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GOT A SECURE YOUR JUNE THIRTY NUMBERS KIND OF MORE IN LINE WITH THE NUMBER ON PAGE TWO. IT LOOKS. WITH IT. AVAILABLE THE NUMBER. SORRY I'M NOT FOLLOWING THE QUESTION OF HOW I MIGHT HAVE TO PROCESS THIS A LITTLE BIT OF ON AGAIN OFF A LITTLE BIT LATER ON JUST JUST YOU KNOW WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEM THE MEETING WE HAD WAS THE LAST WEEK REGARDING JUST ON GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LONG **** CAPITAL PROJECTION I HEARD YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT YOU THINK BY JANUARY OF THIS YEAR YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US THAT INFORMATION IS THAT CORRECT. THE MARKET WILL BE ABLE. WITH THE- JANUARY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO- REQUESTED FOR THAT INFORMATION. SOURCE I'M SORRY SAY AGAIN COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN I'M SORRY. YES THE LITTLE REPORT LANGUAGE I REQUESTED INFORMATION BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND ITS OUR COMMITMENT TO COMPLETED BY THAT DATE. VERY GOOD GREAT IN AND THEN AS AS YOU. GO THROUGH THAT- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF YOUR SORT OF METHODOLOGY THAT YOU'RE GONNA START TO. ON A CHOOSE FURTHER CONSOLIDATION IN CERTAIN- TO A SPECIALIZED COATED SUBSIDES HOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO. GO THROUGH YOUR DETERMINE PROCESS HOW YOU CONSOLIDATE THAT PRISONERS IN THE FACILITIES. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT TO SHARE AT THIS TIME I BELIEVE THE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO TO START WITH IS TO MEET WITH A VERY STAKEHOLDERS. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- THAT THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS OBVIOUSLY OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS INDIA P. BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS COMES DOWN TO THE DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS IN THE DIFFERENT MISSIONS OF THE DIFFERENT PERSONS- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE WERE TO PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION OF ANY. THAT THEY HAVE SIMILAR MISSIONS AND SIMILAR POPULATIONS THAT ARE SERVED BY THOSE LOCATIONS- SO THERE'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR US TO TALK ABOUT THOSE PER HALF PROJECTIONS OF HOW THAT MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN OVERLAY THAT WITH- THE PRISONS THAT ARE EAGER GOOD CANDIDATES FOR REMAIN OPEN GOOD CANDIDATES POTENTIALLY FOR CLOSURE AND HOW TO COORDINATE THE- SO I'M THE FIRST ONE I DON'T HAVE. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EMBARKING UPON- AND I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF IT TO SHARE WITH YOU WOULD. YOU WANT TO SHARE THE DETAILS OF HOW YOU CHOSE DVR. BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THE- TRANSACTION TWO ZERO SIX SEVEN AND WE HAD A LITTLE DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME I'M SORRY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE- LOCAL MEMORIZED. YEAH I'M I'M GOING TO THE LIBRARY- SO THE SIX ITEMS IN THAT PEOPLE CODE R. COSTA OPERATE. WORKFORCE IMPACTS SO POPULATION AND GENDER SPECIFIC HOUSING. LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN STATE OWNED AND OPERATED PERSONAL FACILITIES INCLUDING PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS. PUBLIC SAFETY AND REHABILITATION AND THE DURABILITY OF THE STATE SOLUTION PRISON OVERCROWDING. SO A NUMBER OF THE ITEMS THAT- MOVED- DVR YOU TOWARDS THE CLOSURE DECISION- SOME OF THEM ARE PHYSICAL PLANT ITEMS WHICH IS ONE OF THE SIX CRITERIA. THE LOCATION IS PRONE TO FLOODING I'M PLAYING ACCORDING A ARE A CATASTROPHIC FLOOD I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX- THAT. CUT OFF THE INSTITUTION FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THE OUTSIDE ROADS- WE HAVE CHRONIC ISSUES. WITH POTABLE WATER AND WASTEWATER DISCHARGE. DENIED DUE TO ITS LOCATION I'M IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SACRAMENTO RIVER DELTA AREA. I'LL BE ON THE FACILITY ISSUES THERE WERE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. I GOT SOME MISTER BORK JUST JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY WHY DID THIS FACILITY STAND OUT OVER THE OTHER. THIRTY SOME FACILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. I DID DID YOU DID YOU TAKE EACH THOSE. SIX CAL AND PENAL CODE US THEM. POINTS OR PERCENTAGES AND THEN RANK THAT CAME OUT RANKED NUMBER ONE. IT WAS NOT THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS IN THE NATURE OF OUR THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED AND OPERATED INSTITUTIONS DIDN'T ALLOW ITSELF TO ANY SORT OF MAP EQUATION IN ORDER TO REACH THAT CONCLUSION. SO THERE BUT THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MEAN COMPLETELY ARBITRARY DECISION THAT. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THING I WOULD NOT REFER TO DECISION F. AS ARBITRARY. YOU HAVEN'T PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE. TO THE CONTRARY. THERE ARE ERIC SWANSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE FACILITY ISSUES THAT WERE A DVR THAT WE CONSIDERED WE ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE IMPACT TO WORK FORCE WAS LESSENED BY CHOOSING THAT FACILITY. AND IT HAS A MIX OF POPULATION MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM THAT MADE SENSE FOR YOUR HANDS WELL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BACKING INTO ARE YOU CHOSE DVI YOUR TICKETS NOT. THAT YOU'RE NOT WALKING US THROUGH HOW YOU CHOSE THE VIA. MEETING SOUNDS LIKE YOU CHOSE DVI AND NOW YOUR GIVE ME THE REASONS. WHY DVI FITS. BUT YOU'RE NOT WALKING ME THROUGH THE METHODOLOGY OF HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THE DECISION. THE DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- THAT WERE REACHED THAT. APPROXIMATED THE SIX CLOSER FACTORS THAT WERE LISTED IN THE PENAL CODE SECTION OF DATA THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US. I WOULD HAVE IS KNOCKED OUT OF IT I WOULD THAT WAS GIVEN BY ALL I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SEEK PERMISSION TO SEE HOW THAT DATA CAN BE SURE. I WAS JUST ONE PART OF PROVIDING DOWN ON FACILITY SITE. WERE IS DOWN IT WASN'T PROVIDED ON STAMPING ON. I'M SORRY YOUR METHODOLOGY IS NOT VERY CLEAR I'M HAVING VERY. THOUGHT HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FOLLOWING YOUR METHODOLOGY. AND THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT IS IF WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR TO FIVE MORE FACILITIES TO- POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATE WHICH WE THINK IS A GOOD STEP WE DO YOU WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE. ON A- SET OF CRITERIA THAT YOU WOULD YOU SAY IT'S IN THE CODE WHICH WE APPRECIATE- BUT THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT- ALL OF US HERE COULD FOLLOW. FOLLOW THAT CRITERIA AND THERE'S A CERTAIN METHODOLOGY- AT THIS POINT WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY AND VERY CONFUSING. SO I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO USE THAT WORD BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN ME. NO EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. TAKING I'M TAKING A LACK OF RESPONSE BY- SILENT KNOWLEDGE MENT OF. THE TRUTH. WELL WHAT I TELL YOU THIS WE HAVE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS DONE IN A MANNER THAT GATHER DATA WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ANSWER IS NOT SATISFACTORY TO YOU BUT THAT THAT DIDN'T THAT WAS THE DEAL AND I DON'T KNOW WAS DONE BY TICKET GATHERING DATA IN A COMPARISON OF THAT DOWN UP ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF. THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO REACH A DECISION BY DEPARTMENTAL LEADERSHIP IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DOCTOR MORE COMING WE COULD GATHER SAME DIED AND WE COULD. YOU KNOW AGAIN USE YOUR. SAME METHODOLOGY TO PICK FOR FACILITIES. ROCKETS THE SAME TO YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE HOW DID WE ARRIVE ON TO SAY WILL REDUCE THE SIX CRITERIA WE JUST CHOSE FOUR FACILITIES WE THINK. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BACK TO ME. AND I TELL YOU WHAT WE THINK ABOUT. I HEAR YOU. MISTER CHANG I'M SAYING IS THAT THAT WOULD BE A LEGITIMATE WAY FOR A LIST OF CLOSER TO BEING TO BE A PUT TOGETHER OKAY GRATEFUL WITH THEM WE CAN COMPARE THIS WE'LL DO OUR LIST YOU GUYS. DO YOUR LESS. WOULD THAT BE A ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. WOULD YOU RATHER JUST HARRIS SHARE WITH US YOUR METHODOLOGY ON HOW TO DO AS WE GROW UP IN THE SAME PAGE. SEE FURTHER OUR GUIDANCE ON THAT ISSUE AND WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THAT QUESTION YEAH WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW WHO YOU'RE- SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM BECAUSE WE COULD POTENTIALLY SEE GUYS FROM THE SAME PEOPLE TO. IS THAT THE SOURCE FROM THE SECRETARY IS OUT FROM. YEAH I REPORT TO THE SECRETARY SHOULD BE FROM THE SECRETARY'S OFFICE GREAT WE CAN WE WILL SEEK HER. PERMISSION AS WELL- GET GIVEN THE- WHEN ARE YOU AND I GET THE REASON THE REASON WE REPHRASE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE NEXT FOLLOWING AGENDA ITEMS TO AND I APOLOGIZE TO I THINK IT'S A THREE I THINK WE WERE WE'VE REITERATED AND COMMITTEE BEFORE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DESPITE THE FACT THAT AGAIN THE LIST SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD LISTED. THEY SEEM LIKE THEY NEED TO BE REPAIRED AND I'M SURE YOU CAN LET US KNOW- THE JUSTIFICATION FOR EACH OF ALL OF THOSE REPAIRS ON BUT THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT MET THE METHODOLOGY SO WE DON'T APPROVE AND- SIGN OFF ON REPAIRS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY FOR FACILITY MAYBE SLATED FOR CONSOLIDATION OR WILL BE MAY BE REDUCING THE POPULATION SIZE. SO THAT THAT'S WHY THIS IS IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SORT OF- YOU KNOW ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US TO DO THE TEN YEAR PROJECT WITHIN GOTTA BE EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL BUT BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME WITH APPROVING MANY OF THESE THAT CAPITAL COSTS AND WIFE THERE WHY THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST KEEPS KIND OF GROWING BECAUSE WE'RE UNABLE TO. TO GET- THE DATA IN SINCE THE IN A REPORT WILL BE TO US IN- YOU KNOW BEFORE BUDGET TIME I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY OUR METHODOLOGY HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ARRIVING AT APPROVING OR NOT APPROVING- THIS LIST OF WHAT'S WHAT SEEMS. LIKE A REASONABLE REQUEST. DO IT I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE INACTION ON OUR- OKAY. I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BASED ON THE FIRST AGENDA ITEM THANK YOU MESSENGER. THANK YOU- YOU HEARD IT AT THE BEGINNING EFFORT AND AT THE END OF THE ISSUE- THAT. LITTLE MORE INPUT INTO METHODOLOGY I'M PLANNING TO THAT WE ARE. BEING MINDFUL OF PROJECTIONS OF POPULATIONS BUT ALSO OF OUR TAX DOLLARS THAT IS MUCH APPRECIATED AND LONG OVER DUE. I ANSWER LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY A MORE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. I WITH THAT. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND ITEM. IF WE'RE GETTING. MY NAME IS CHRIS LEAD FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CITY ARE ALSO THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS WITHIN THE SITE AND AS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA I'LL TOUCH ON THE PROPOSALS- RELATED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDED FROM STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING THEN I'LL SUMMARIZE THE PUBLIC PROPOSALS. AND HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE. THE FIRST NOVEL IT LOOKED ABOUT IS THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. THIS FUNDING SUPPLEMENTS THE BASE SPECIAL REPAIR FUNDING- THAT WE RECEIVE HER TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND WILL ALLOW CDCR TO PURSUE A GROUP OF PROJECTS THAT ARE DESIGNED AND READY TO PROCEED TO CONSTRUCTION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR GENDER OR SEVERAL. THAT WE INTEND TO PURSUE WITH THIS FUNDING. I'D LIKE TO DRAW FINALLY FIFTY ISSUES RENEW KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS AND MAINTAIN. THEM THIS ONE TIME FUNDING WILL ALLOW A FIFTY THREE YARD TO ADDRESS URGENT REPAIRS AS WELL AS TO HELP AVOID CONVERGENCE THE REPAIRS IN FUTURE YEARS I PERFORMING PLANNED PREVENTATIVE REPAIRS AND SYSTEM REPLACEMENT. AT THE NEXT POSTAL I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS IS A FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REPLACEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES- THAT INCLUDES ONE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND TO DESIGN THE REPLACEMENT AND THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THIRTY TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR CONSTRUCTION AND THE FOLLOWING BUDGET YEAR. ROOF REPLACEMENT IF NECESSARY BECAUSE THE DETERIORATED CONDITIONS OF THE EXISTING GROUPS THAT SEVERELY IMPACT HOUSING CONDITIONS AN INMATE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS REFLECT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR FUTURE READ REPROACH ACT SPECIFICALLY INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGHER BIRTH MEDICAL AND AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT MISSIONS WERE GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY AS INMATES AT THESE LOCATIONS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARM FROM CONDITIONS FOR ALL THINK LEAKING ROOFS- IN HOUSING PROGRAM LOCATIONS. I'M NEXT TO CAPITAL OUTLAY- SIXTY ARE. THAT PRIORITIZES CAL POLY CRIED. THAT ADDRESS ORDER MANDATE. URGENT KERR LIFE TAKING UPGRADE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROJECTS TO WORK WITH. THE PARTICIPATION. THANK INCLUDES SIX OUT PROPOSED AND THREE THAT ARE TO PROVIDING ADEQUATE FACILITIES RELATED TO- COMPLAINTS OF PLANNING BOARD DIRECTIVES. TO BETTER RELATED TO SUPPORTING SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF PROGRAMMING TO ENHANCE AND ONE TO PROVIDE A SAFE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR MEDICALLY SENSITIVE INMATES PATIENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVENTION PLAN FOR HEAT RELATED PATHOLOGIES REQUIRED BY THE HOME COURT. A QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THESE PROPOSALS- IT'S A NEW PROJECT. SHE REQUESTED ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DESIGN OF THE AIRPORT PROJECT. EVENTUALLY AT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY. ROGER ECHO. LATER ONCE A PAPER IN REASONABLE TREE EDUCATION AND OFFICE WITHIN FACILITY HAPPENED SHE AND FATF THIS PART WILL OR AT SIX PROGRAMS I PROVIDING IN TEMP FOR INMATES TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AND EDUCATION HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THESE AREAS LEAD TO MISTREATMENT. AND EDUCATION HOURS. SIX REQUEST THAT ARE FOR YOU IN CASE OF- BECAUSE PRODUCTS. THE FIRST OF THOSE IS THE AIR COOLING PRODUCT IN FACILITY IN OF THE- AND FOR. WE IS MEDICARE REST IN THE HIGH RISK POWER. OUT THERE. IN FIFTY WITH THEIR- PREVENTION FOR HE REALLY HEALTH FOR BY THE COMING GOVERNMENTS EARLIER. WE THERE'S THE HUNDRED TWENTY SOUTH DLLARS PER. FOR THE WORKING DRAWING PHASE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON OFFICIALS COUNTY MEDICAL PREPARATION ROOM UNIT THE FIVE WHICH IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION AND ENHANCED OF PATIENT PROGRAM. ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION IN THE PROJECT WILL INCREASE STAFF PRODUCTIVITY AND SUPPORT TIMELY AND MAKE PATIENT ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH PLOT OF COURSE AMERICANS. LAST DON'T KNOW HOW IS THE SUB APPROPRIATION OF FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PROJECT PHASE TWO I KALPETTA THICK PRESENT. THIS PROJECT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE FACILITY NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN- THE RECEIVER TURNAROUND PLAN OF ACTION- DURING CONSTRUCTION WE DETERMINED THAT THEY THINK FUNDING IS NOT ADEQUATE COMPLETE THE PROJECT SPECIFICALLY INCREASE COSTS TRIBUTE TO DESIGN ERRORS AND OMISSIONS RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM INTO THE SITE WIDE MONITORING SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS TO THE FIRE WATER SUPPLY AND RELOCATE HELLO EVERYONE. IT IS TO WORK WITH ALSO NOT VERY RELATED TO PROVIDING FIRE RECORDERS INCREASE ARE ALSO RELATED TO THE EXTENDED JOB DURATION FOR THE DESIGN ARIZONA MANY MISSIONS JUST MENTIONED AS WELL AS POPE IN NINETEEN THIS RESULTED IN THE DIFFERENT COSTS FOR INMATE WORD LABOR STUFF HAVE TO LABOR AND GARDEN- BUT I'M HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THIS A. O. HAVE A CALM. KEEP AN EYE ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE A. L. WE DO HAVE A- ON THEM BUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME AUGMENTATION FOR SPECIAL REPAIR AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THAT IS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE FUNDING GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE OR SPECIAL PARA DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AT STATE PRISONS THAT ARE NOT GOING AWAY AND LIKELY WILL GET MORE EXPENSIVE IF NOT ADDRESSED- HOWEVER GIVEN THE- THAT THE STATE IS. AS COMMITTED TO CLOSING ONE PRISON- YET HASN'T IDENTIFIED IT ONE ADDITIONAL PRISON YET HASN'T IDENTIFIED IT. AND BASED ON PROJECTIONS COULD BE IN A POSITION TO CLOSE ADDITIONAL PRISONS- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THESE PROJECTS IF. UNDERTAKEN AT ONE OF THOSE PRISONS MIGHT. BE COMPLETED AROUND THE TIME THAT THE PRISON IS BEING CLOSE GIVEN THAT THESE PROJECTS CAN TAKE A COUPLE YEARS TO COMPLETE. SO WE RECOMMEND. RESTRICTING THE USAGE OF BOTH CDC AIRSPACE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SPECIAL PREPARED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET AND A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME AUGMENTATION- SO THAT THEY CANNOT BE SPENT AT PRISONS THAT ARE LIKELY CANDIDATES ARE STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE. AND ADD TO- HELP AFFECTION WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION WE THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF PRISONS THAT IT BELIEVES ARE STRONG CANDIDATES- EVEN IF IT'S NOT NECESSARILY COMMITTING TO CLOSING THEM- HOWEVER ABSENT THAT BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW WE THINK THAT. DE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY IN SAN LUIS OBISPO CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY AND- SOLEDAD AND SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON ALL APPEAR TO BE STRONG CANDIDATES. FOR CLOSURE GIVEN THEIR- EXTENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR NEEDS AND HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS RELATIVE TO THEIR INMATE CAPACITY. THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU WE ARE NOT GONNA BE TAKING ACTION ON ANY OF THESE ITEMS ON AND TO THINK AGAIN AT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT WE REALLY NEED THAT PLAN IN ORDER TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE AREN'T SPENDING DOLLARS WISELY DURING THIS TIME OUT THERE- I DO TWO FIVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN. THAT WAS OMITTED AND THAT TOO BIRTH- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN VERSUS TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS THE EVENTUALLY AT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND A COUPLE YEARS. IT ROASTED THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER LOOKING AT A 60% INCREASE IN WHAT WAS ESTIMATED. THIS IS JUST WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENED IN A COUPLE YEARS THAT CREATED SUCH A DRASTIC INCREASE TO. THE OVERALL MASTER PLAN FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. RIGHT MADAM CHAIR EIGHTEEN MORTGAGE I MEAN AGAIN FROM CDC ARE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT AND I GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WITH AN ANSWER- WE CAN SEE THAT IN THE AGENDA BUT DID NOT HAVE TIME TO FILL OUT THE PREVIOUS MASTER PLANS. AND ANALYZETHOSE NUMBERS SO WE WILL COMMIT TO A GETTING AN ANSWER ON THAT- BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I WITHIN THE NEXT A- WEEK TO WEEK AND A HALF. AND SO I THINK THIS IN LINE WITH OUR BUDGETEERS COMMENTS OF. METHODOLOGY EIGHT I THINK WE WANT TO SEE INFORMATION BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE INFORMATION THAT WE AVE COMING BEFORE US. ON IS WHEN WE SEE THESE LARGE DISCREPANCIES AND VARIANCE AND JUST A COUPLE YEARS- OF YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS I WOULD TO MY DISTRICT WOULD GO REALLY LONG WAY- IT MAKES US QUESTION- AND HAVE A LOT OF THIS COME FOR. YES IT DOES WHAT IT THANK YOU THESE AT THIS POINT. ON AND SIZE WERE MOVING FORWARD AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE PLANS- THAT. MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY IS IMPORTANT THIS IS WOULD BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT. MISTER LUCKY YEAH I JUST pAND BACK UP- ARCHER SILVA RETAINS- REQUEST FOR METHODOLOGY AND CRITERIA AND THE REASON WHY THAT SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE EIGHTY FACILITIES HERE. A SLATED FOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT. RACK UP A BILL OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE JUST SPENT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN A PRISON THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN. I DON'T WE'RE LIKELY TO REPEAT A SIMILAR- MISTAKE IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE UTILIZING TO MAKE THIS. TO READ IN THE CRITERIA WE SHOULD PROBABLY HOLD OFF ON THOSE REPAIRS AND SO I THINK THE COMMUNICATION IS TO BE STRONGER FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE SHARING IN THIS RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING THESE DETERMINATIONS THAT SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO BACK YOU IN A CORNER WE JUST WANT YOUR PARTICIPATION WE NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION SO WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS. KIND OF COMMUNICATION. MISTER THINK. WOULD SUGGEST A PIGGY BACK ON BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS SO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AT THIS TIME GOOD I WOULD I WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT ANY OF THE EIGHTEEN FACILITIES. YOU ARE BRINGING FORWARD COULD NOT BE. ANY OF THE HENCE THE UP TO FIVE FACILITIES THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT CLOSING. SEOUL LIKE I SAID I DON'T THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS OF AT THIS TIME. THE QUESTION WOULD BE THAT ANY OF THE FACILITIES YOU ARE BRINGING FORWARD- WOULD THEY POTENTIALLY BE POSSIBLY CLOSED IN THE NEXT. I GUESS WHAT'S THIS AT THE TIME FROM THE NEXT FOUR FIVE YEARS FOR FIVE YEARS OR SO. FIVE FIVE YEARS. WHAT WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW SO WE HEAR THAT AND- WE WILL WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEES AND FIRST IN THE SEPARATION AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION THAT THIS INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED UP TO THIS POINT IN TIME. WITH THE GUYS THAT WE WOULD JUST WANT ASSURANCES THAT ANYTHING ON THIS LIST WOULD NOT BE POTENTIALLY SLATED FOR CLOSURE IN THAT NEXT FIVE YOU'RE PIRED OF COURSE WE CAN'T WE HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS OR SO THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT REASONABLE BUT AT LEAST I THINK WE COULD AT LEAST SAY. WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT COULD BE SLATED FOR CLOSURE WE JUST WOULD NOT WANT TO BE- SPENDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY OBVIOUSLY DOES LIFE SAFETY ISSUES IF YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE FACILITY OPEN FOR FIVE YEARS YOU DO HAVE TO ME UP TO DO CERTAIN CERTAIN TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS BUT- LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD IMAGINE YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT A NEW ROOF ON THE FACILITY GONNA. CLOSE IN FIVE YEARS JUST JUST FOR EXAMPLE. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MISTER JOHNSON- AND I JUST WANT ALSO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR IF YOU HAD THIS INFORMATION NOW TODAY TO OFFER DISCRIMINATED I BELIEVE AND I'M LOOKING AT ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE THAT YOU PROBABLY IF WE HAD TO VOTE ON IT YOU PROBABLY WOULD GET. APPROVAL OF FACILITIES THAT DID NOT FIT INTO THOSE CRITERIA OF FACILITIES BEING CLOSED I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS DEDICATED AN AND WILL GO HEAD TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THE RENOVATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED SO THAT THESE THESE FACILITIES ARE COMPLIANT AND SAFE FOR EVERYONE AND CITED I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE WITH YOU THINKING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AT ALL. OUT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE ABSOLUTELY MUST PROVIDE ALL THE FUNDING WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ARE UP TO SPEED SUCH. THIS IS FOR YOUR DAD THIS IS FOR YOU AND WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THANKS. THANK YOU ARE INTO COLLABORATION WILL HOPEFULLY GET US TO. A BETTER PLACE- WE ARE IN BUDGET THE FIVE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY BUT THE REALITY IS THOUGH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF US WERE ELECTED TO THIS. TO THE TWO BODIES HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE- THE WHOLE BY TENANTS THE TALIBAN. A LOT OF NEEDS OUT THERE AND OUR COMMUNITY SAID WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE EVERYTHING OUT- AND SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT ASSEMBLY- INFORMATION A METHODOLOGY ALONG THE WAY THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHERE WE HAVE VARIOUS- NON CAPORALI PROPOSALS. THE PANEL'S VERSION THREE WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF EACH OF THOSE THE PROPOSAL FOR. A AND M. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AT THE BEGINNING- AND WE WILL ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU.

I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL CANTEEN RESOURCES FROM THE INMATE WELFARE FUND. WE MADE THIS REQUEST IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO MEET GROWING DEMAND FOR CANTEEN ITEMS. ENSURE CANTEEN ACCESS TO SEE THIS YEAR'S INCARCERATED POPULATION. M. A. WELFARE FUND WAS CREATED IN SECTION FIVE ZERO ZERO SIX OF THE PENAL CODE AND IT'S CONSIDERED A TRUST HELD BY THE SECRETARY OF CDCR. IN MAY WELFARE FUND USES REVENUES IT GENERATES MET MOSTLY FROM CANTEEN SALES TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS. ALL CANTEENS ARE REQUIRED TO BE SELF SUPPORTING AND ALL PROCEEDS OF THE FINDER REQUIRED TO BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE CANTEENS OF INCREASINGLY BECOME A RESOURCE FOR THE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS WHICH BENEFIT OUR POPULATION. BESIDES PROVIDING FOOD AND SUNDRIES FOR PURCHASE THE CANTEENS ARE NOW THE DISTRIBUTION POINT OF OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION. AND READING CLASSES WHICH OCCURRED DURING NORMAL SHOPPING TIMES. WE ALSO OFFER A HEALTHIER CANTEEN ITEMS FOR SALE OF THOSE ITEMS ARE DETERMINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FOOD STATEWIDE GOOD ADMINISTRATOR. AND OUR DIETITIANS. THE MAJORITY OF THEM IT WILL OFFER FUND EXPENDITURES ARE ITEMS PURCHASED FOR RESALE. WITHOUT THIS AUTHORITY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ENOUGH ITEMS TO SELL AT THE CANTEEN. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PURCHASE ITEMS THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR RESALE. DUE TO OUR PROPOSED 10% RENDON LIMIT INCREASE. WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING SEVEN POSITIONS AT SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS TO HELP US ENSURE ARE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO CDC OURS POPULATION FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT THE CANTEEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST AND I'M NOW GOING TO PASS THAT ALONG TO MY COLLEAGUE KEITH ROBINSON. GOOD AFTERNOON KEITH ROBINSON THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD MINISTRY FOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CHIEF THE DIETARY. FROM THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL EALTH CARE SERVICES DEVELOPER STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED MENU WHICH WOULD NOT ONLYMEET THE DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKE AND THE RECOMMENDED DIETARY ALLOWANCE IT ALSO PROVIDES A HEALTHY EATING PATTERN AS RECOMMENDED BY THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS. AND YOU IDENTIFIES CARBOHYDRATE CHOICES. ALLOWING OUR INMATES LIVING WITH DIABETES AND OBESITY TO MAKE EDUCATED FOOD MENU CHOICES THIS REQUEST IS TO INCREASE THE STATE WIDE FEEDING RATE BY TWENTY TWO CENTS PER INMATE PER DAY FOR FOOD AND SUPPLIES TO UPDATE THE FOOD MENU FOR ALL INMATES TO PROVIDE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS. FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE MADE THROUGH THE STANDARD ON ALLOCATED POPULATION ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. PROVIDING A MENU LOWER IN SODIUM FAT PROCESSED SUGARS OVER TIME CDCR COMMITTEE GATE DIET RELATED ISSUE. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL NOTE IT IS COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO GAIN WEIGHT UPON INCARCERATION ANNA OBESITY IS MORE PREVALENT AMONG PEOPLE LIVING IN PRISONS. BUT IN THE COMMUNITY CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AMERICANS HOT AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL GROUPS RECOGNIZE THE WELL ESTABLISHED ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DIABETES. KIDNEY DISEASE AND THERE ARE DISCOUNTS. TRICIA AND FOOD CHOICES CAN LEAD TO CHRONIC DISEASE DEVELOPMENT INDEPENDENT OF OBESITY. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER. IN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS EATING MORE FRUITS VEGETABLES AND WHOLE GRAINS AND LIMITING THE CONSUMPTION OF RED MEAT AND PROCESSED FOODS IN RECENT YEARS CTC ARTS VENUE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON DAILY ALLOWANCES FOR CALORIES HOWEVER IT FAILED TO ADDRESS AN OVERALL HEALTHY EATING PATTERN AS RECOMMENDED BY THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS. GIVEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIET AND HEALTH. CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS RAISED CONCERNS THAT INMATES COULD NOT MAKE EDUCATED FOOD CHOICES BECAUSE CDC OURS MENU. OFFER SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENTLY HEALTHY FOOD ITEMS. THIS CDCR SPECS THIS MENU CHANGE ALONG WITH AVAILABLE. AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHCARE CANTEEN OPTIONS TO RESULT IN POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR ITS INMATES POPULATION ALTHOUGH RESULTS MAY NOT. SEEN UNTIL LONG TERM OBESITY HYPERTENSION AND OTHER DIET RELATED ILLNESSES AND AFFECTS TO DECREASE WITHIN THE INMATE POPULATION OVER TIME I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AFTER THIS PRESENTATION. THANK YOU TO HAVE DEPARTMENT OF MENTALLY SORRY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT I MEAN ALEJO FOR COMMENT. MOREOVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THE SURFERS ON THE CELLULAR INTERDICTION PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER IN REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL WE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE RENEGOTIATED CONTRACT WITH A VENDOR THAT PROVIDES TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR INMATES AND WARDS OF. THAT COULD NOT JUST ISN'T THIS IS YOUR PRISONS. AND WANTED INFO BECOMES THAT THEY ON THAT CONTRACT WILL REACH OUT TO THE DOOR STAFF TO LET THEM KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS ON THE CONTRACT- IN ON TO. THE TRAY OR A HOUSE SEEING AND SO OF PREFERENCES AS WELL AS THE INCREASE CANTEEN RESOURCE WE HAVE NO. WITH PEOPLE. ON THAT HEALTHY MENU OPTIONS PROPOSED. WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNED WITH A PROVISION OF HEALTHY MEALS TO INMATES HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT FOR CHANGE TO THE MEALS PROVIDED TO INMATES. STUDENTS ARE HAVE BEEN USING THE MENUS THAT IT'S PROBABLY TO CONTINUE USING SUCH TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. INSTEAD THIS PROPOSAL IS ABOUT THE FUNDING. STRUCTURE FOR THE PROGRAM. RIGHT FROM ABOUT IN ON THE IN MAKING BECAUSE HUNDREDS FUNDING FROM HOLD YEAR. ENTITIES HAS BEEN LEADER FUNDING PAY FOR THESE MEALS FROM. PLANT OPERATIONS POSITION SUCH AS- AND LYFT. AND WHILE THESE PROVISIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE THEY'VE BEEN HARPER FIELD ANGRY AS A RESULT CDCR THOUGHT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN SAVINGS FROM THESE VACANT POSITIONS. BANCOR THOSE FUNDING TO BEEN REDIRECTED PAY THAT NEIL COSTS. STREETS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE USING THE BACON SAVINGS JUST FOR ACROSS OF THE MEETING IS GOING FORWARD AS WE- BUT IF YOU CAME TO THAT IT DOES NOT THINK THAT THEY- SAY WILL BE SEPT. TO COVER THE ENTIRE. FOR THE IN THE EMAIL COSTS. BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE LOWER VACANCY FOR THEM CLOSER USING THE NUMBER UNTIL POSITION. AT THE END OF THE PANDEMIC TEMPORARY WE'VE GOT SOME CALL THE TIME BREAKING IT UP TO POLICY REDUCE WILL SERVE PAYING TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMING TO AN END AS WELL. THE LAST IMPACTORS THINGS COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT PEOPLE TO THOSE. POSITIONS OUR WE FIND THAT. INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON THE VACANCY SAVINGS CITIES OUR- THE BUDGET YOUR- SPECIFIC HOW MUCH TO STATE THE DEPARTMENT SPECTER BEEN THE BUDGET YOU FROM THE TO THE- HOWEVER I DID NOT ASK. AND HOW TOTAL ESTIMATE SAY WOULD USE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT DO THEY STRUCK ME HI LADIES WE RAFTING THESE TO SUPPORT THEM IN COSTS REASONABLE THE NEW YORK. GIVEN THAT THIS IS A TOPIC IT FILLED IN SO IT'S LIKE IN THE WILL BE SAVINGS IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER IT'S ONLY BE DONE ON TEMPORARY. BASIS TO DRIVE. THIS SHORTFALL PARTIALLY IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH THAT KERN GENERAL FUND CONDITION OTHER THAN TARGETED TO ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES POWER SHOULD NOT BE A LONG TERM STRATEGY BECAUSE I WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT FOR THE FUNDING FOR THESE. OPERATIONS POSITIONS WHAT IS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE GIVEN THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE INTENDED TO HELP MAINTAIN THE PRISONS AND AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING THEIR COMPLAINTS ARE COUNTY. A STATE OF GREAT DISREPAIR- FIND FIND THAT FOR THE ACTION IS NEEDED TO FILL THESE VACANCIES ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND TO ADDRESS THE PANEL CORRECTIONS WORKLOADS. AND WE KNOWLEDGE THAT CITIES ARE HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS IN THIS AREA AS OF JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN- INCREASE RECRUITMENT FOR THE POSITION BUT IT IS A LOT OF COULD BE NECESSARY BEYOND. RECRUITMENT INCLUDING INCREASING THE PAY RATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER THEY GIVES YOU READY ACCESS TO SOMETHING THEY COULD CONSIDER. AS WELL AS CONSIDERING HIRING CONTRACTORS USING EXISTING VACANCY SAVINGS INTO OTHER POSITIONS CAN BE FILLED WITH CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. MAKING GREAT STEP IN MEETING FROM TOP RATED POSITIONS EVERYBODY I MEET WITH THE TRAINING SO. THEY CAN'T PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS RECOGNIZE REQUIRE YOU CAN SEE ARE TO. ON THE STATE STATE. IN SPECIFICALLY ESTIMATED THE TOTAL NOW OF TIME OUT CRAZY BIG SAID THAT IS TO ONE POINT TWO. OUR PRIVATE ESTá AND HOW PLANS TO IT ESTIMATE STATE BEGINS. AND THEN THEM. IS PROVIDED WE RECKON WITH ACTUALLY GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNTIL THEY SEE. INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AS A COULD DEMONSTRATE. THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FINALLY YOU. REQUIRING CDC PROVIDED DETAILED PLAN TO ADDRESS ALL. WERE AND DEVELOP THIS AND THE MINISTRATIONS CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OTHER QUESTIONS. BEYOND THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THANK YOU. QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU THINK MY FIRST QUESTION MIGHT BE FOR MISS IRWIN I SHOULD BE FROM MY ONLY QUESTION AT THIS TIME I'M IN LIMITATION MURDER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THE ALLEY AS RECOMMENDATION. SURE THANK YOU ARE WE ARE CONVINCED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AS THE L. A. R. SAID WE ANTICIPATE THEIR SALARY SAVINGS TO BE TEMPORARY AND THEY WON'T FULLY BE AVAILABLE ON GOING TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE CDCR IS CURRENTLY INCREASING ITS HIRING EFFORTS AGAIN AS ALLI ASIDE EIGHT SOME OF THAT THE VACANCIES ARE DUE TO COME BAD- AND ALSO THAT TO PLAN PRISON CLOSURES WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VACANCIES- THE PROPOSAL ITSELF DOES ASSUME THAT SOME SALARY SAVINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON GOING WHICH IS WHY THE REQUEST IS NOT FOR THAT. FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BUDGETED AMOUNT. AND THE COST OF THE NEW MENU. WE'D ALL LIKE SAY AB. WHAT WE THINK PROVIDING HEALTHIER MEALS FOR THE INMATES IS VERY IMPORTANT THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER TO PROVIDE THOSE ME ALSO THEY DID FIND SAVINGS TO MAKE SURE THEY COULD IMPLEMENT IT HOWEVER THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU I THINK MY FIRST QUESTION IS FROM IS IRWIN ON THE CONTRABAND THEN LOOKING AT THE LAST PAGE OF OUR BUDGET DOCUMENT PAGE FOURTEEN AND WE HAVE A TABLE THERE IF YOU HAVE THAT AVAILABLE. YES I BELIEVE SO AND SO IF I LOOK AT THIS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND KNOW THAT WE STOP THEM VISITATIONS FROM MOST OF THE YEAR WITHOUT THINKING CAP INMATES FROM THE COUNTY JAILS AS WELL BUT WE'RE STILL SEEING FROM HIGH LEVELS OF CONTRABAND. AND WE'RE SEEING SOME INCREASES WITH SOME OF THE CONTRABAND HERE. ON THIS TABLE. IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. I AM A- I AM WITH THE TECHNOLOGY A DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION SO I'D LIKE TO DEFERRED TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION. I AM DIRECTOR IT CAN REALLY CYCLE. DIFFERENT TACK TO ME BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE ANY OF YOU BUT YOU'RE RIGHT- IN MARCH WHEN KOBE HIT MARKET THE MARCH WE SEIZE VISITING WE CITIES HAVING VOLUNTEERS VISITORS COMING INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND WE STILL HAD- AN INFLUX OF CONTRABAND- COMING INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS- YOU WILL DIRECTLY. THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT WE STILL DO HAVE- CONTRACTORS COMING IN OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT WE ALL DO WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- IT'S- IT'S COMING AND YOU STAFF WELL. AND WE ARE WORKING YES SERIOUSLY AND WE DO HAVE A HOST OF DIFFERENT- CONTRABAND- TOOLS THAT WE USE TO- TRY TO FIND ALL THE CONTRABAND THE DISCOVERY AND REMOVE IT PRIOR TO COMING INTO THE INSTITUTION AS WELL AS TOOLS THAT WE USE- DETECT AND FIND CONTRABAND WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. LET ME SEE IF I DON'T OF FINANCE. AT I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT CONTRABAND ALSO MAKES ITS WAY WITHIN THE INSTITUTION- THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE CALLED THAT DROPS WHERE SOMEONE WILL THROW CONTRABAND OVER THE FENCE SO INMATES CAN FIND IT. CONTRABAND ALSO CAN COME IN THROUGH THE MAIL ROOM SO CDCR IS STILL ACTIVELY WORKING TO LOCATE AS MUCH CONTRABAND AS POSSIBLE SO THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES OTHER THAN VISITING FOR THE CONTRAVENTION MAY COULD STAND SIDE. AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE AVENUES FOR THE CONTRABAND BUT THE STRATEGY IS THAT WERE YOU SEEN AND- ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD. YOU STRATEGIES BETTER OR- ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES WE COULD BE SEEING I MEAN IT'S STILL ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND CELLPHONES IN TWENTY TWENTY STILL A REALLY LARGE NUMBER OF EITHER THROUGH THE MAIL OR BEING THROWN OVER THE FENCE. AMOUNTS UHHUH OF CONTRABAND WE'RE LOOKING AT TOBACCO YOU KNOW. A FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS THIS IS WITH THE SAKE I REALLY THAT THERE'S MORE THAN THAT BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OUR STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONTRABAND WHERE INVESTING MONIES I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO LAUGH ABOUT THIS WE ARE INVESTING MONIES- AND DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE TRYING TO DO INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAMS- AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WERE MAYBE GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH OUT THERE AND SO. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT PEOPLE BRING THINGS OVER THE FENCE BUT I THINK IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME POINT WE'VE BEEN- POUNDING ON FROM THE BEGINNING HAVE YOU SEEN OUR DAUGHTERS OUR DOLLARS WISELY OUT THERE AND SO. DO WE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW TO BETTER USE OUR STRATEGIES ON THIS CONTRABAND. SO WE HAVE A REFLECTANCE. WITH HER WOULD WE HAVE A LARGE- OF THAT COMING IN THROUGH MAIL ROOM- THREE PACKAGES- AND ALSO- DROPS AROUND THE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER RECENTLY AND I'M- ONE OF OUR PILOT PROGRAM STOP DOWN OR SAD IF INSTITUTION WE HAD A CONTRABAND INTERDICTION PILOT PROGRAM GOING ON FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND A HALF- HELP CSU FRESNO- HAS RECENTLY. COMPLETED A DRAFT. REPORT ON THEIR FINDINGS OF OUR PILOT PROGRAM- WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT DRAFT REPORT AND ONCE WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND INFORMATION- WILL PROBABLY BE MAKING SOME PROPOSALS ON SOME. SOME ADDITIONAL- DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ON ONCE THEY DETERMINE THAT THEY RECOGNIZED AS BEING. BOTH THE BEST AND KEEPING CONTRABAND OUT OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN CATCHING IT BEFORE IT CAME AND- THANK YOU- I DO. WHY LAST THING ON THE CELL BUT BEFORE COVAY ON THIS IS ACCOUNT I KNOW A LOT OF HAS PUT VISITORS OUT THERE AND THIS MOMENTS GIVING US AN UNWANTED DATA POINT BUT AN IMPORTANT THAT A POINT THAT IT'S MORE THAN THAT AND SO I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE PROPOSAL COMING FROM ONE OF OUR GREAT STATE INSTITUTIONS- TO HOPEFULLY IMPROVE. THE SYSTEM SO THAT AS WE ARE INVESTING AND- HELPING FOLKS WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE I WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ON AND NOT BEING DERAILED WITH AND MARCH AMOUNT OF CONTRABAND COMING IN TO OUR PRESENCE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES. MISTER CHANG. I JUST WANNA FOR CHAIRS BECAUSE SO SUGGEST REITERATE IF YOU TO SEE VERY- GIVEN THE NUMBER. THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY IT ABSOLUTELY WAS NOT THE VISITORS. IN SO JUST GOING BACK TO- THAT. MOMENTUM TO BE SECRETARY IF YOU COULD JUST. CAN YOU JUST WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY THAT- WERE WERE IMPLEMENTED TO TRY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CONTRABAND COMING INTO THE- FACILITIES. HERE I'M SORRY COULD YOU HER LARGER THE QUESTION. NO I GET I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE TALKING TO ME I'M SORRY- RIGHT RIGHT THE STATE- SO WE HAVE A PILOT PROGRAM GOING ON IT'S OUT OF WHICH YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF- WHERE THEY HAD MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT THEY WERE USING. THEY HAD A TSA'S STYLE- THE SCANNER LIKE YOU WOULD USE IN A BAGGAGE PERSONAL SCANNER ALL THE STAFF AROUND ALL THE BETTER THINGS THROUGH WE HAD ENHANCED OR CANINES- WE HAD. DEPLOYED SOME BONO'S BODY SCANNERS THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS- ADDITIONAL BAGGAGE AND PERSONAL SCANNERS WE DEPLOYED HIGH SENSITIVITY METAL DETECTORS- SO WALK THROUGH METAL DETECTORS AS WELL SOME COOPER SECURITY CAMERAS AND ADDITION TO SOME CELLPHONE FRIEND SIX- MACHINES THAT HELP- IDENTIFY INFORMATION ON CELL PHONES. AND WE ALSO DO ENHANCE OUR SHIP SEARCHES EACH MONTH OR IN IDENTIFIED AREAS- LOOKING FOR CONTRABAND I'M TRYING TO- INTERDICTED BEFORE COMES IN FOR INSTITUTIONS AND THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR EXAMPLE MINUTES SO FAR- AND I'M PROBABLY MISSING A FEW BUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE COMING RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. NO PRESSURE THAT THESE GIVE A GUESS AS TO WHY IT SEEMS THAT- 420-182-2019 THINGS- WE'RE IMPROVING AND THEN- SOME OF SOME AREAS SHOWN- SORT AN UPTICK IN TWENTY TWO DO YOU HAVE A- ANY. GAS OR- THEORY AS TO WHY THAT WHY THAT IS BUT SHE'D GIVEN THAT YOU HAD A LOT FEWER MOVEMENT OF INMATES AS WELL AS THE VISITATIONS WERE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. I'M THE QUESTION ON WHY WE THINK WE HAD MORE OF AN UPTICK- A LOT OF IT IS LAND DEMAND BY THE END. RELATION BUT AS WELL AS THE- AND IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW. ONLY STAFF WERE COMING AND FOR MANY MANY MONTHS AND- WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB AT- COMING UP WITH STRATEGIES TO STOP IT BEFORE IT COMES. IN AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. GOOD GOD SO YOU- I GUESS WHEN YOU SAY IS THE- PLY VERSES DEMAND I THINK WE'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THIS THE PLIGHT PART WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S DEMAND. SO- WHY YEAH YES SO I MEAN I MEAN YOU HAD THE SAY I ASSUME YOU DIDN'T DO LESS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN TOWARD ME MEETING YOU DIDN'T STOP IN THE- PROCEDURES IN TWENTY TWENTY DID YOU. IT IS IT IS IT JUST THE PART THAT YOU FELT DID YOU FEEL THE FACILITIES HAD DID A BIT OF A LESS WORSE JOB OF IMPLEMENTING. YES YOUR PROCEDURES. NO I DON'T THINK SO- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE- PEOPLE COMING INTO THE PRISON THEY CELEBRATED FAIRLY GOOD JOB AND INTERDICTING CONTRABAND- BECAUSE IT WAS A LARGE REDUCTION IN PEOPLE- ACROSS THE BOARD COMING INTO OUR INSTITUTIONS FROM VOLUNTEERS TO VISITORS- SO FINDING- THAT MUCH CONTRABAND- WAS GOOD. THANK YOU THE- OKAY- EIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO MISTER TANKS COMMENTS HAVE YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE MARIJUANA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A LOOK AT THE NUMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE NUMBER WENT DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IT WAS CUT IN HALF- BUT THEN WE SEE THE UPTICK IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WERE YOU DOING MAYBE BETTER BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT WE CAN DO IN TWENTY TWENTY. NOW WE COULD LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF SEARCHES- THAT WERE DONE- YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME- WITH THE AMOUNT OF MODIFIED PROGRAMS STUDENT HOPE IT. DOES PEOPLE JUST SEARCH- LUCKILY WE GET INFORMATION WE'RE ABLE TO DEPLOY OUR CANINESAND TO DO MORE TARGETED SEARCHES IT ON AN ENTIRE HOUSING UNIT. INSTITUTIONAL MANDATED TO DO THAT YOU SHOWN BY. ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REGULAR SEARCHES THEY CURRENTLY DO. OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL MAYBE IT THANK YOU SAID YOU'RE DOING A BETTER JOB SEARCHES NOW. AND SO MAYBE TAKING SOME OF THE SKILLS THAT YOU PICKED UP DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY CALL THERE AND CONTINUE WITH THAT DOWN THE ROAD OR SOMETHING THEY COULD ALSO LOOK INTO. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM OUR COMMITTEE. MISA WHERE THAT IS. THANK YOU SO REGARDING THE SAFE HOUSING FOR TRANSGENDER INMATES- SENATOR WIENER'S SB ONE THIRTY TWO DIDN'T ANTICIPATE ONGOING FUNDING. SO ONCE THE INITIAL REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN THE IMPLEMENTED WHAT DOES THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVE THE POSITIONS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE. BE ABSORBED BY EXISTING STAFF RESOURCES. HELLO THIS IS CAPTAIN STARK. SO- BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OKAY YEAH GO AHEAD SO IT IS A PART OF SOME OF THE POSITIONS REQUESTE ARBOR- CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR TO SPECIALIST SO THOSE POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD HELP WITH- CONSISTENCY IN DECISIONS MADE WHAT IN THE REQUEST TO BE HOUSE BASED ON THEIR GENDER IDENTITY SO NOT ONLY WILL THEY BE PROVIDING TRAINING TO THE COMPLICATIONS STOP THAT ARE WORKING OUT OF THOSE PHONES- CASES OR CALL. THEY WILL ALSO BE- HANDLING SOME OF THAT WORK BEHIND THOSE REQUESTS- ALSO. WHAT WE REALIZED WHEN THE TRANSGENDER WORKGROUP WAS ESTABLISHED WAS THE OTHER AREAS- THAT REALLY NEEDED SOME ATTENTION- SURROUNDING SB ONE THIRTY TWO IMPLEMENTATION THOROUGH MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SO MEDICAL- REQUESTED YOUR HELP OF A PHYSICIAN SURGEON POSITION AND MEDICAL I AM VERY MENTAL HEALTH REQUESTED I'M A PSYCHIATRIST AND A PSYCHOLOGIST I BELIEVE- AND REALLY. THE ONGOING TREATMENT OF THE ON GOING IN- FEDERATIONS UP FOR THIS- POPULAR POPULATION WAS IDENTIFIED VIA THE WORKGROUP AND- PENCE THE DIRT ADDITIONAL REQUESTED POSITIONS. THANK YOU. IF I AM AND MAYBE I CAN. HEY WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT THIS IS WRONG TO ME BACK IN. HOPEFULLY WE CAN. CAN HELP AND THIS IS ALSO. A REASON WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE DATA. AND MAYBE THE COMMITTEE MIGHT BE. YOU MAY BE SEEING SOMETHING THAT WERE NOT SEEN OR NOT COMMUNICATING WELL. AND LET'S JUST LOOK AT CELLULAR PHONES. ELEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THAT WERE CONFISCATED IN TWENTY TWENTY. I BELIEVE. YOUR BASEMENT ON EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS AND IT SAYS THE MANAGE ACCESS SYSTEM SOLUTION PREVENTS THE CELL FROM FROM CONNECTING TO CELLULAR SERVICE EFFECTIVELY NEUTRALIZING COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES INSIDE THE PRISON. SAUL LET'S JUST SAY. OUT OF THOSE EIGHTEEN PRISONS ARE WE BELIEVE EVERY PRISONER AND NOTE EIGHTEEN PRESENT. HAVE A CELLULAR PHONE. THIS IS ALL PRISONS SAWDA NINETY FOUR THOUSAND SOME ODD PRISONERS YOU WERE ABLE TO CONFISCATE ELEVEN THOUSAND HOUSE GOING TO SAY IF THIS WAS BASED ON EARLY EIGHTEEN MAYBE TWENTY THOUSAND YOU GOT 50% OF THEM I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE EVEN MORE MONEY TO GET RID OF THE OTHER ELEVEN THOUSAND. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS OPERATION MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS WE WITH THAT ARM ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT- THE PEOPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY. ARE ABLE TO BASICALLY BE FRAUD. THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS STATE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EDT FOR OUR- I WOULD EVEN SAY WE SHOULD GIVE MORE MONEY TO IT BUT IT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT EFFECTIVE THIS STRATEGY IS WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH DOING MORE THAT UNLESS WE HAVE AN AUDIT THAT SHOWS. THAT IN CERTAIN PRISONS THERE WAS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AND SO WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING NOW IS EVEN IF WE DO THIS WE HAVE TO DO ADDITIONAL THINGS. BIKE CAMERAS FOR PRISON GUARDS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE. NOT JUST AS THE CDC- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SECRETARY TOLD ME THAT ALL THESE PHONES WERE COMING IN UNDER BRED TRUCKS ESPECIALLY WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR BREAD THEY DON'T HAVE BRED SHIFTED THE INMATES ARE MAKING THE BREAD. AND SALT I THINK YOU NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND REALLY LOOK CLOSELY. IN AMERICA. AND LOOK AT WAYS THAT YOU CAN STOP. ALL OF THIS CONTRABAND FROM COMING IN. AND CREATE SYSTEMS NOT ONLY WORKED WITH CAMERAS ON EVERY PRISON GUARD AT A BILL THEN. BUT YOU ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU YOU. SEND EACH ONE TO SOME KIND OF SCREENING PROCESS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS IN LABOR. BUT IF YOU DID THE MATH OF THE NUMBER OF GUARDS EACH DAY TIMES. THREE AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS AND HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES. I'M NOT SURE YOU WOULD GET TO A BILLION DOLLARS. IN N. AND COST OVER TIME OR IN THIS CASE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STOP THE CONTRABAND THE DEATHS THE SUICIDES THE OVERDOSES THAT ARE RESULT OF ALL OF IT. AND SO IF WE WERE TO ACOSTA NOW TO DO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IF WE WERE JUST DO A COST ANALYSIS OF IT. AND YOU WERE TO BRING IT TO US WAYS YOU COULD YOU PLEASE STOP CONTRABAND IF YOU BROUGHT A COMPREHENSIVE- PROPOSAL TO US. I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WHERE NOT ONLY EMBRACE IT- BUT WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND AGAIN I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ON THIS M. A. S. SYSTEM- AND SEE HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AND- ROOTING OUT CONTRA. AND SO- BUT I. YOU KNOW I WAS CORRECTED I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS HOURS CORRECTED THAT THAT NUMBER WAS OVER. ALL OF THE INSTITUTION MEANS ALL OF THE INMATES AND SO OXIDES IS STILL I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S OUT OF. YOU KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S TWENTY TWO THOUSAND- CELL PHONES THERE LEGALLY CONTRABAND IN PRISONS. WELL YEAH ELEVEN THOUSAND IS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE NUMBER BUT AS THE CLOSER TO FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND THEN YEAH WE'VE WE'VE GOT A- REDO OUR NUMBERS AND SO IF YOU COULD. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT OR IF YOU CAN COME BACK TO US WITH A MORE ROBUST PLAN ON HOW TO GET RID OF CONTRABAND. IN PRISONS I WOULD I WOULD EMBRACE IT LOVE IT HECK WE WOULD EVEN. FUND. MISTER JONES SAWYER. HI THIS IS TAMMY IRWIN AGAIN. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IT DOES APPEAR AS THOUGH THE- INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE HAVE MANAGED ACCESS TO PLAY DO HAVE. FEWER CONFISCATION- OF. CONTRABAND I'M- ALSO. I'M WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ONCE DEPLOYED ONCE THE CONTRABAND REACHES INSIDE THE PRESIDENT OF CONTRABAND. CELLULAR DEVICES ARE INSIDE THE PRESIDENT. THAT MANAGE ACCESS IS THE TECHNOLOGY- THAT HELPS TO- WORK THROUGH AND THE DETERRENT OF- BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL DEVICES ESPECIALLY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW WARRANT PROCESS. WHERE WE ARE WRITING A WARRANT TO THEN DE ACTIVATE DEVICES I PERMANENTLY SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT WILL URTHER DETERMINE THAT IS A STILL A FAIRLY NEW PROCESS I WITH THIS MANAGED ACCESS SYSTEM AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO CONTINUE. WITH THAT- BUT THAT PROCESS AND TO FEED BE A DEEPER IMPACT BUT IT MAY HAVE. CAN I WOULD BE WAITING TO HEAR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT- IT'S NOT THE DISK COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT TOO THANK YOU. THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU KNOW I JUST ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THE MANAGE ACCESS SERVICE IS TO PREVENT THE CELL FROM FROM WORKING BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT OVERLOOK IS THAT WHAT CITIES HERE IS PROPOSING WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING IS DECOUPLING. HOW THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE MAN'S ACCESS SERVICE AND IF WE'RE PAYING FOR IT THAT MEANS THE PRISONERS. THEMSELVES OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED. WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THROUGH EXORBITANT TELEPHONE FEES. ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR IT AND SO FOR US TO TAKE THAT. EXPENSE ON IS GOOD. BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING AWAY FROM PROBLEM HOW THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED BUT IT ALSO GIVES US BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE COSTS AND DEMANDS THAT SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SYSTEM AND NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT JAILS AND PRISONS HAVE BEEN. UTILIZING AND BENEFITING FROM THE TELEPHONE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE REVENUES FROM THAT SERVICE TO FIND A NUMBER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHICH AGAIN IS JUST THE WRONG WAY AROUND. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VISIBILITY AND HOW THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED. AND THEN THE CONTRCTOR THE TELEPHONE PROVIDER IS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE CALLS. THAT THAT I COULD EVER EVEN IMAGINE. AND ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING SO MANAGING COMMUNICATIONS IN A BETTER WAY. AND TAKING KIND OF CONTROL OF WHAT THOSE WHAT IT HAD BEEN. FUNDED THROUGH THOSE CONTRACTS IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT AND THIS IS A GOOD THING I THINK IS TO SHIFT HOW THIS EXPENSES HAPPENING GIVING US BETTER VISIBILITY BUT THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING. THAT TECHNOLOGY BETTER AND HOW THAT BECOMES A DETERRENT. TO THE USE OF CELLPHONES BECAUSE AS IF HIS CELL PHONE IS NO LONGER USABLE INSIDE. AND THROUGH A SYSTEM LIKE THIS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. IN BE SHUT DOWN AND LOCATED THEN THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE THE TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS THIS IS A GOOD TRACK AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THE WAYS WE HAVE BANNED UTILIZING SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS IN HAD BEEN DONE FOR FISCAL REASONS. BUT UTILIZE THESE CONTRACTS N. AND THEN PASSING ON THE EXPENSES INAPPROPRIATELY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. I THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION- MISTER SUN THAT PERSPECTIVE. OKAY SO JUST WE WERE AGAIN WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION TODAY- AN EXCITED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY DISCUSSION THAT THIS TOOK PLACE AND JUST WANTED TO COUPLE UP ON THE- FROM THE DRUG DISCUSSION SINCE THEN THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING AN INCREASE GOING ON EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE LESS MOVEMENT UNLESS VISITATION. AS YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON THAT SO I HOPE IN THE FUTURE I IT AFTER YOUR- GET THE REPORT FROM. HEALTHY FAST THOUGH YOU'RE ABLE TO SHARE WITH THE SOME ADDITIONAL STRIDES HE'S GOING TO BE USING TO HELP PREVENT THE CONTRABAND FROM COMING INTO THE FACILITIES SO WERE LITTLE BETTER EQUIPPED TO HELP OUR AND MATES- BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEIR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HEALTHCARE SO WITH THAT I'M AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW.

AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT- MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A TOP AROUND BACK. ALSO AS FAR AS THE CELLPHONE OF THE CONTRABAND I DON'T THINK. YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. JUST BEING LIKE A WASTE OF MONEY- WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS ACTUALLY GIVING- INCARCERATED PEOPLE FELL. BECAUSE ACT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW DURING THE PANDEMIC.

WHEN IMPLEMENTING NAFTA LEASES AND PRISON CLOSURES SAFEGUARDS MUST BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT THE TRANSCRIPT OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ICE CUSTODY. BUT NOT FORGET. DURING DURING NEED FOR RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE. THAT MEANS NOT ONLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASING PRISON RELEASES BUT CHANGING TOUGH ON CRIME WATER POLICING POLICIES. THAT HAD BEEN DRIVING INCARCERATION CRISIS. BY FILLING THE STATE ANTI PRISON BEDS AND REINFORCING A TOXIC CULTURE- BUT ACTUAL PUNISHMENT.
