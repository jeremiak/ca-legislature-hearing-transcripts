SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.163
THAT THIS CLOSER SORIA

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.330
DISCLOSURES ARE SHORT AS

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.032
POSSIBLE AND EASY FOR THE

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.889
ADVERTISERS SHOULD NOT HAVE

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.224
DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING EQUALLY

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:14.226

SECONDLY WE'VE COME TO

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:17.496

ALWAYS BE FAIR AND CONSISTENT

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.799
THE VOTERS CAN EXPECT TO SEE THE

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.471
A SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:28.240
ISSUE WITH DOING SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.577
IT CONSISTSOF THE DISCLOSURES.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.178
SO IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:34.646
DISCLOSURE ITSELF DOES NOT

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:36.715
PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.251
