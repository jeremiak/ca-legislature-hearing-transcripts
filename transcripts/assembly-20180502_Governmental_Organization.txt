AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH MISTER STONE WHO IS IN. THE AUDIENCE VICIOUS DON'T PLEASE COME ON UP THIS. MEMBERS IS. ITEM TO AB TWENTY THREE OH WAIT. WELCOME MR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE AWAY. WHAT TWENTY THREE AB TWENTY THREE OH EIGHT WOULD DO WOULD BE TO STOP THE SALE OF CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA WITH FILTERS? I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT AN INTERESTING IDEA. BUT HERE'S THE BACKGROUND TO THIS. CIGARETTE FILTERS ARE CIGARETTE ITEM THAT WE FIND A COSTA CLEANUPS RIVER CLEANUPS PARK AND EVERYWHERE. JUST WALK THE GROUNDS THE CAPITAL AND YOU SEE CIGARETTE IT'S SOMETHING THAT TENDS TO BE VERY UBIQUITOUS WHEREVER WE GO AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S UNAVOIDABLE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT LITTER PROBLEM. AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF PLASTICS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CIGARETTE FILTERS ARE PLASTIC. IT'S CELLULOSE ACETATE SO IT'S PERVASIVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT BREAK DOWN. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE PLASTIC THOUGHT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING IDEA TO SEE HOW WE COULD REDUCE THE IMPACT OF WHAT GETS TOSSED INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. NOW MISTER CHAIR I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT. ANALYSIS HE WAS VERY THOROUGH IS VERY LONG. BUT IS ALSO VERY FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF. THE ISSUES THAT WE REALLY FACE HERE BECAUSE AS WE'VE TRIED TO TALK ABOUT THIS BILL BEFORE. WE GET LOST IN THE NOTION THAT TAKING THE FILTER OFF A CIGARETTE WOULD CREATE A MORE DANGEROUS PRODUCT IN THE SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE GET KIND OF CAUGHT UP IN THE. SO THAT THE MYTH THAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAVE PUT ON US OVER THE YEARS THAT ADDING FILTERS WHICH WERE ADDED STARTING IN THE FIFTIES AS THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT. ONCE CIGARETTES RULINGS TO LUNG CANCER AND OTHER NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS. AND. SINCE THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE AND SEND SMOKERS THAN SINCE I'VE BEEN RUNNING THIS BILL I TALKED TO A LOT OF SMOKERS BOTTOM DON'T LIKE THIS AND I IDEA SOME OF THEM DO LIKE THIS IDEA BUT ONE OF THE COMMON THREADS. AND THE CONVERSATION REALLY STARTED WITH COULD WE GO TO A REUSABLE FILTER COULD BE GO TO SOME OTHER. ASPECT THAT WOULD MAKE THE SMOKERS MORE COMFORTABLE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY SAY WE SMOKE. WE TOSS THE SMOKE. WE TOSS. SO WHY NOT TAKE THE STEP TO MAKE WHAT GETS TOSSED. A LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL PRODUCT. WE'RE NOT AFFECTING THE HEALTH THE SMOKER. AND THE AND THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCES VERY CLEAR ON THAT AND FRANKLY WHY THIS IS DOUBLE REFERRED TO GEO AND THEN TO HEALTH IS SOMETHING I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND. DATA RESOURCES MAYBE AND AS THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT TO POTENTIALLY RATHER TAX BECAUSE THERE'S CLEARLY SOME ISSUES THAT THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THEIR. BUT THE HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT REALLY A PART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. NOR ARE THEY SOMETHING THAT. GETS PREVENTED BY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND WE DO HAVE SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT. SO LET'S CUT TO DRILL DOWN AT THE IMPACT. SEE IF THEIR CISCO TELLS US THAT THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR JUST CLEANING UP CIGARETTE CALTRANS TELLS US FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST CLEANING UP CIGARETTE*. CITIES AND COUNTIES WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH STORM WATER RUNOFF NOW. ARE FACED WITH A SITUATION THAT THEY HAVE TO GET PERMITTED AND SPEND MONEY ON CLEANING UP THAT STORM WATER. IF THERE WERE NO CIGARETTE. BUT CIGARETTE FILTERS. IN THAT RUNOFF THEN THERE TASK WOULD BE EASIER BECAUSE THE FILTERING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE LESS SIGNIFICANT. AND THEY'RE THE ONES CARRYING THE BRUNT OF PICKING UP THE CIGARETTE*. NOW I KNOW THE QUESTION ABOUT LATER IS ALSO PREVALENT ONE AND WHY DON'T WE JUST GO AFTER. LETTER AND REYES THAT THE PENALTIES FOR THAT. WELL PENALTIES FOR LITTERING THROWING A CIGARETTE OUT OF A CAR WE'VE ALL SEEN IT SPECS IN THE TWILIGHT THAT ORANGE RQ SOMEBODY SMOKES TOSSED THE CIGARETTE OUT. OR ON THE GROUNDS THE CAPITAL OR ON A BEACH. THEIR FINES UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS. DO WE RAISE THAT TO TEN. TO RESET THE FIVE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. AND AGAIN SMOKERS TELL ME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY SMOKE. AND THEY TOSS SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN CHANGE THAT BEHAVIOR I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN UP THE PENALTY SO MUCH. THAT IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BARRIERS THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE. SO. FOR THIS BILL. CHANGING THE PRODUCT SLIGHTLY AND IT'S NOT A SILLY AFFECTING THE PRODUCT ITSELF BECAUSE MOST CIGARETTE COMPANIES DO HAVE FILLED WITH THE CIGARETTES THAT THEY OFFER. DOES EXIST BACK THAT'S BREWING ALL THAT WAS THERE PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. WHEN I GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS. AND HAVE A PRODUCT AND THAT IS THE DOES NOT CARRY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COST. SO SOME OF THE YOU KNOW HAS RAISES SOME ISSUES AS WELL MIKE THOUGH FEDERAL PREEMPTION. BECAUSE THE FDA HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR. THAT THEY REGULATE CIGARETTES BUT WHAT THEY REGULATORS THE CONSTRUCTION. OF CIGARETTES NOT NECESSARILY THE CIGARETTE ITSELF IS VERY CLEAR IN LAW. AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE HAS BANNED FLAVORED CIGARETTES. TO ME THAT GOES A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THIS NOTION OF CONSTRUCTION SINCE IT'S DECEIVE NEW YORK TELLING THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES WHAT CAN BE IN THEIR PRODUCTS. AND THAT PASSED THE TEST IN FACT THIS THE FIRST AND SECOND. CIRCUIT COURTS THOUGH ON THE EAST COAST WHICH TEND O BE THE ONE TO HEAR CIGARETTE CASES AGREED. AND HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT. STATES AND COUNTIES CAN IN FACT BAN CIGARETTES WERE BANNED CERTAIN TYPES OF CIGARETTES SO I THINK THIS BILL WOULD VERY CLEARLY. NOT BE PREEMPTED BECAUSE WE'RE JUST SAYING FILTER THE CIGARETTES WOULD BE OKAY IN CALIFORNIA FILTERED CIGARETTES WOULD NOT BE. SO THAT I A TRIPS IS PROBABLY NOT A PROBLEM ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS AS WHY DON'T WE REQUIRE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS. WELL INTERESTING THOUGHT ALTHOUGH OF THE TWO IDEAS BANNING FILTERED CIGARETTES WAR REQUIRE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS THE BIODEGRADABLE FILTERS NOW GOES MORE TO THE CONSTRUCTION. OF THE CIGARETTE. THAT IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT. PREEMPTION ARGUMENT BUT JUST BE ENDING A FILTERED CIGARETTE. REALLY DOES NOT. ALSO BE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT THE TAXATION ISSUES AND THE YEAR THE REVENUE ISSUES AND THE PIRACY ISSUES IN THE PIRACY ISSUE I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT. WE TALKED TO FIT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE FIRST BROUGHT UP THIS IDEA. THEY DID SAY THAT AS THE STATE PASSES LAWS LIKE THIS WE WILL SEE A SPIKE IN IN PIRACY. BUT IT TAILS OFF AS PEOPLE GET USED TO IT. THE THIRTY PERCENT NUMBER OF. PIRATED CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA IS PROBABLY DRIVEN MORE BY THE TWO DOLLARS. A PACK TAX THAT WE PUT IN PLACE THIS BODY PUT IN PLACE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT WENT FROM EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS A PACK. A TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTS A PACK THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF PIRACY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. WOULD THAT IMPACT PIRACY IN CALIFORNIA PERHAPS BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT SPECULATIVE TO SAY HOW MUCH SENATE'S IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH STUDYING IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT. WHAT WHETHER NOT THIS WOULD REALLY DRIVE PIRACY OR WAYS AROUND IT? NOW I'VE BEEN HEARING ALSO FROM I LOCAL RETAILERS AND I KNOW WE'LL BE HEARING FROM SOME OF THEM TODAY BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT WE DO IN SACRAMENTO DOES AFFECT THE RETAILERS. BUT TO THE RETAILERS AND HOW EXPLAINED IT. FOR THEM THE ONCE OF CONTACTED ME IN MY IN MY DISTRICT. THEY WOULD BE GETTING A SUPPLY IF THIS WERE TO BE PUT IN PLACE. OF NON FILTERED CIGARETTES THAT THEY COULD THEN SO INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THEIR SUPPLY THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS AND SELL CIGARETTES SHOULD BE UNINTERRUPTED. AND IF WE WANTED TO BUILD IN SOME BUFFER SO THAT THEY CAN SELL DOWN THEIR STOCK THAT WE COULD FACE THIS AND. THAT'S THAT WOULD BE FINE WITH ME BECAUSE I DON'T NECESSARILY. PART OF ME WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO NOT BE SELLING CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE BUILT AROUND THAT THEN THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO INTERRUPT THAT. THIS BILL IS REALLY INTENDED TO TAKE. THAT FILTER OUT OF OUR CIRCULATION THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL SO FROM WATER QUALITY STANDPOINT. FROM A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STANDPOINT. CLEAN UP THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO. TRY TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESS AND PIRACY AND IN FACT I THINK THE SMALL BUSINESSES. WOULD. WHICH SHOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE WOULD FIND SOME WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT PIRACY. THEY'RE THE ONES BEING HURT MOST DIRECTLY BY THAT THIRTY PERCENT CIGARETTES COMING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM OUTSIDE. THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LOSING THEIR SALES. SO WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING PIRACY WE SHOULD BE TAKING A MUCH HARDER LOOK AT THAT. AND ON THE REVENUE SIDE AND THEY KNOW THAT WOULD THAT WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP BY THE ANNOUNCES. BUT THE WHOLE REVENUE FROM CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA IS HAS BEEN ON A DECLINING BASIS ANYWAY WE ARE SEEING UNFORTUNATELY OPTICS IN VAPING UPTAKES IN OTHER. DELIVERY SYSTEMSBUT CIGARETTES ARE KIND OF GOING OUT OF FASHION. ADULTS FRANKLY A LOT OF FOLKS IN MY GENERATION. WHO ARE STILL SMOKING SMOKING IS LESS THAN TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA? WHICH. SHOULD RAISE THE QUESTION IF IT'S LESS THAN TWELVE PERCENT POPULATION WHY SO MUCH CIGARETTE WASTE. WELL AGAIN IT'S A DEDICATED GROUP IT'S A GROUP THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO STOP SMOKING IT'S A GROUP THAT PROBABLY WOULD. SWITCH TO FILTER THE CIGARETTES IF NECESSARY. THEY'RE STILL SMOKING. THEY SHOULD BE A PART OF. THE SOLUTION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND I I WILL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IN TALKING SOME THE SMOKERS. WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF TAKING THE FILTERS OFF BECAUSE WE CHANGE THE TASTE? IT WOULD CHANGE THE MOUTH FEEL. CHANGE THAT SMOKE A LITTLE BIT OF BUT IT BILL BUT OF THE EXPERIENCE BUT THAT'S THE TRADEOFF VERSUS THE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. NO TRADE OFTEN HARM TO THE SMOKER THEMSELVES. A LITTLE BIT OF INCONVENIENCE WITH THE TASTE THE MOUTH FEEL AND ALL THAT OF THIS MONTH. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THE SCIENCE IS ACTUALLY THERE SITES ESTABLISHES THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. SO FOR US THE QUESTION IS. IS ARE THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES. ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T BE FACING THIS POLICY. I THINK THE ANALYSIS SHOWS A PATH. FOR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION GETTING OVER THE FEW YEARS AROUND THE HEALTH OF THE SMOKER BECAUSE THE FILTER DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING AND THAT IN. IN THAT RESPECT. BUT REALLY LOOKING AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. AND KNOWING THAT THE SMOKERS GOING TO SMOKE. AND TOSS LET'S MUCH MAKE WHAT THEY TOSS LESS IMPACTFUL ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I ASKED WE ARRIVE AT. AND HAVE WITH ME SOME SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT INCLUDING DR TOM NOVOTNY WHO IS ONE OF THE LEADING RESEARCHERS ON EXACTLY THIS ISSUE AND HAS BEEN TALKING AT THE STATE. FEDERAL AND WORLD LEVEL TO TRY AND INTRODUCED THIS CONCEPT OF GETTING THIS FILTERED THIS. UNPRODUCTIVE BUT DAMAGING PIECE OF A CIGARETTE OUT OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUT OF OUT OF OUR WAY AS WE MOVE AHEAD TOWARDS REDUCING PLASTIC IN. OUR ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THERE'S MY NAME IS MICHELLE GIVEN THEM WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT. ARE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE AWAY. AND A U. S. AS SURGEON GENERAL OR PORTENT TWENTY FOURTEEN HIGHLIGHTED THAT TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS HAVE HISTORICALLY UTILIZED MARKETING AND ADVERTISING TERMS FOR SINGLE USE FILTERS AND PRODUCTS SUCH AS LIGHT LOW ARE MILD. WHICH LED TO CONSUMERS FALSELY BELIEVING THAT THE CIGARETTE PRODUCTS WERE LESS HARMFUL TO THEIR HEALTH THAN SMOKING REGULAR CIGARETTES. ON THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE SURGEON GENERAL AND THE CDC HAVE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED THAT THERE'S NO RISK FREE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO AND NO SAFE TOBACCO TO ADD TOBACCO PRODUCT. EVEN THOSE UTILIZING AS SINGLE USE FILTER AND FAX SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IDENTIFIED BY THE SURGEON GENERAL STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE CIGARETTE DESIGN INCLUDED. INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF THE ALTERATIONS TO THE SINGLE USE FILTERS HAVE NOT DECREASED AND SMOKING NICOTINE INTAKE OR THE RISKS OF CERTAIN TYPE OF CANCERS AND IN FACT MAY HAVE INCREASE THEM. AND WE EXPECT THAT THE PASSAGE OF THIS MEASURE WOULD LEAD TO A DECREASE RISK IN THE NECK AND NICOTINE POISONING RESULTING FROM ILLEGAL LETTER. OF CIGARETTES AND CIGARETTE FILTERS WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY TALK TOXIC PARTICULARLY TO CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF POISON CONTROL CENTERS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INJURIES OCCURRED DUE TO THE INGESTION OF CIGARETTES. AND SINGLE USE FILTER TIPS AT THE MAJORITY WHICH WERE AMONG CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX SO AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MOTION. MY NAME IS THOMAS ABOUT ME I'M A PHYSICIAN AND PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES HERE CHAIRMAN BRAND MEMBERS. I JUST WANT TO. FURTHER DISPEL THE NOTION THAT THE THE CIGARETTE FILTER HAS ANY HEALTH BENEFIT IN FACT ISSUES POINTED OUT JUST NOW. THEIR USE OF THE FILTER MEANS EUROPE YOU'RE INHALING AGAINST AND OBSTRUCTION MEANS YOU INHALE THE SMOKE MORE DEEPLY INTO YOUR LUNGS. AND THAT MEANS THAT IT'S CHANGE THE CELL TYPE OF THE LUNG CANCER THAT IT IS CAUSED BY CIGARETTE SMOKING FROM SMALL CELL TO MY MORE AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF CANCER CALLED ADENOCARCINOMA. THE RISKS FOR SMOKING THE RISK FOR LUNG CANCER RATHER HAVE GONE UP ACTUALLY OVER THE LAST FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS SINCE THE ENGINE AT THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS FRAUDULENT. ATTEMPT TO MAKE A CIGARETTE SAFER IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. NOW THE. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AS A AS A. MISS STONE'S POINTED OUT THERE SEVENTEEN BILLION CIGARETTES SOLD YEARLY IN CALIFORNIA STILL EVERY YEAR SEVENTY BILLION GET DUMPED SOMEWHERE THAT'S WHY IT IS THE MOST COMMON THING PICKED UP ON BEACHES IN URBAN CLEAN UPS THROUGHOUT THIS STATE BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OVER THE LAST THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS. WE'VE DONE DONE THE SITE CLEANUPS NON BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC. I IN THE REST OF THE CIGARETTE IS BIODEGRADABLE SO THAT WITHOUT IT ONE WOULD THINK IT YOU WOULD HAVE MUCH LESS OF A. INSULT TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY HAVING AN UNFILTERED CIGARETTE. THAT'S TOSSED BY SMOKERS AS THEY HAVE. THIS ISSUE OF THE STORM WATER REGULATION I THINK THAT WE MAY JUST REMIND YOU THAT THERE'S A CALIFORNIA CLEAN WATER ACT. THAT HAS THE TRASH AND ADMIT THAT WILL REQUIRE COMMUNITIES TO WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF PROHIBIT ANYTHING GREATER THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS FROM GOING TO STORM WATER SYSTEMS. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE CIGARETTE* SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME EXPENSE EITHER IN THE FILTRATION PROCESS THE CLEAN OUT. AND SOMETHING IT'S A LOT MORE COST EFFECTIVE WOULD BE TO BAN THE UPSTREAM A PRODUCT THAT'S GOING GOING TO BE. COLLECTING IN THE IN THE IN THE STORM WATER. THERE IS THE OTHER. PIECE THAT I ALSO WANT TO DISPEL AND THIS WAS MENTIONED IN THE EMAIL. IN THAN IN THE. VERY EXCELLENT REPORT BY THE WHEN I I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT AS WELL. AND THOROUGHNESS IT WAS DONE UP BUT THERE WAS A MENTION MADE THAT. ON THE. FTA WAS GOING TO PREEMPT. THIS. ISSUE OF OF OF CHANGING THE PRODUCT WHILE THE STATE WOULD NOT BE CHANGED IN THE PRODUCT ONLY THE FDA CAN REGULATE THE CONTENT OF THAT MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCT UNDER THE FAMILY PREVENT A SMOKING PREVENTION TOBACCO CONTROL ACT OF THE VOICE ON THE C.. T. CA WITH STATES CAN DO THOUGH IS IS SPELLED OUT IN THE SAVINGS CLAUSE OF THE LEGISLATION FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE. CRITICS ABILITY OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO YOU RELATIVE TO. OR PROHIBITING THE SALE DISTRIBUTION POSSESSION EXPOSURE TO ACCESS TO ADVERTISING OF PROMOTION OF OR USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY. AND WE'VE PUBLISHED THIS IN THE HAMLINE LAW REVIEW MY COLLEAGUES SAID OF WE MITCHELL SCHOOL OF LAW SAY JUST THIS THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO THIS. SHOULD THE STATE NOT DECIDE TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS OF BILLS THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAIN FACT TAKEN UP. I'M WORKING NOW WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DEVELOP A CENTER ON TOBACCO IN THE ENVIRONMENT AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY FUNDED BY THE TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE RESEARCH PROGRAM. TO. HELP OTHER COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO PRESENT OUR PREVENT. THE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS OF. SECRET BUT IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I HOPE YOU DO. CONSIDER THIS AGAIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS TOSSED MILAN I'M I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS A AND I WANT TO STRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WHICH YOU HEARD AND EXCELLENT. AT TEST ME ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS WE HEAR FOR HEAL THE BAY WHICH IS AN ADVOCACY GROUP IN SUDDEN CALIFORNIA'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS. AND HAS LED AMONGST OTHER GROUPS THAT THE CHARGE ON CLEANING UP THE BEACHES ARE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY WHICH WILL SAY IS CHARGED TO. A HELP KEEP ITS COMMUNITY CLEAN. WHICH STAR CHUMASH FUND IN THE SEVENTH GENERATION ADVISES BUT JUST A SPECIFICALLY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS. THIS IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT BAN WE TRIED BAND BEFORE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT BAN THIS IS A PREFERRED I'M SURE FOR MANY PEOPLE A PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE TO AN OUTRIGHT BAN. A DIS THESE SO FILTERS ARE NOT BIODEGRADABLE AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE YOU'VE HEARD THAT IT IT CHOKES UP THE. THE. STORMWATER DRAINS A AND THEN FINALLY IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS OF COASTAL CLEANUP AND OTHER CLEAN UPS WE HAVE NOT SEEN A CHANGE IN PATENT. IN SOME AREAS WE HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IMPACT WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE A DAY LITTERING WE HAVE NOT IN THIS CASE UNFORTUNATELY MAYBE IT'S THE PRACTICE MAYBE IT'S THE SIZE OF THE FILTER. WHAT'S LEFT OF THE BUT IT'S EASY TO THROW THAT AWAY AND QUITE FRANKLY WE HAVESEEN VERY VERY LITTLE REDUCTION NO MATTER WHAT EDUCATION OUTREACH TO HAS BEEN. YOU SEEM VERY RIVER LITTLE REDUCTION IN THE LETTERING OF THIS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT. THERESA BURKE REG ON BEHALF OF ZERO WASTE USA THE FIVE GYRES INSTITUTE WILD COAST PACIFIC. ARPS I PLASTIC POLLUTION COALITION AN UPSTREAM POLICY AND SUPPORT. KELLY BUCKS ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HERE IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR SUPERVISORS ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AND JENNIFER COMPUTER LOW ON BEHALF OF THE MONTEREY COUNTY UBER SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. JENNIFER SAVAGE WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. SYLVIA'S A LEASH ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA WE THINK THIS BILL WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING TO KEEP CLEAN ONE OF THE BUSIEST BEACHES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THINKING. OKAY TO RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATTIMER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION. OUR OUR RETAIL MEMBERS CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE I'M DEALING WITH LETTER THAT. I'M IS A CONCERN IN MANY COMMUNITIES NOT JUST COASTAL COMMUNITIES. WE WOULD HOWEVER. OF JACK TO THE THOUGHT THAT THE WAY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF TO USE THE DOCTOR'S NUMBERS. PARKS MAY SEVENTEEN BILLION. CIGARETTES SOLD A FAR AWAY MAJORITY THEM ART WINDING UP ON OUR BEACHES I DON'T WANT TO. I KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS QUOTED ANALYSIS THAT TALK ABOUT. SOME CIGARETTE* PICKED UP IN IN A RECENT SURVEY OF BEACH CLEAN UP THE STILL A FRACTION OF WHAT GETS LITTERED I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE STILL ARE TALKING ABOUT. A FRACTION OF WHAT IS OTHERWISE WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATELY DISPOSED OF BY LEGAL CIGARETTE SALES. A LEGAL PRODUCT A CIGARETTE SALES ON OUR OUR. CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR ANALYSIS THAT PUTS LEGAL SMOKERS HAVE DEALT WITH NUMEROUS CHANGES IN STATE LAW IN THE IN RECENT PAST. ON MANY OF THOSE WE UNDERSTAND WERE IMPORTANT POLICY MATTERS RAISING CIGARETTE SMOKING AGE TO INCREASING RECENTLY CIGARETTE TAXES I'M OVER THE SEVEN YEARS AGO MOVING PEOPLE FROM SMOKING INDOORS AT SUCH A NUMBER OF THOSE POLICIES. AGAIN LEGAL SMOKERS UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE AND HAVE GRAPPLED WITH AN ADDRESSED. LEGAL SMOKERS TODAY HAVE A CHOICE OF A FILTER CIGARETTE UNFILTERED CIGARETTE THAT IS TRUE AND YET THE CHOICE OF THE OVERWHELMINGLY MAKE IS FOR FILTERED CIGARETTE NORTH OF NINETY PERCENT OF THE SALES OR. FILTERED CIGARETTES AND SO THIS IS YET ANOTHER IN THEIR EYES IN THE EYES OF THE RETAILERS THAT THAT WORK WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS THIS IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO WHAT IS OTHERWISE A LEGAL PRODUCT. WE'D CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT IN FRUSTRATION. IN ALL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST BEACH COMMUNITIES ABOUT LETTER AND CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT MORE TO BE DONE TO EDUCATE AND IN FACT I DON'T THINK A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE IS WARRANTED BUT SOME ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT AROUND LETTER WILL STICK MAKES SENSE. AND THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY FOR FOR THE RETAIL COMMUNITY FOR THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE YET ANOTHER. IF YOU WILL 쉛D IS THEIR ABILITY TO CONSUME A LEGAL PRODUCT BUT THAT MAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOBLE. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GENEROUSLY PREFER THE CALIFORNIA SUGARS SOCIALIZATION. HARD DATA SHOWS THAT NINETY NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF THOSE CIGARETTES HOLDING BUYER DISTRIBUTORS WHICH FOR THOSE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. AND IN CALIFORNIA. ART FILTERED CIGARETTES SO THREE TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT OR NON FILTERED. OF THE QUESTION BECOMES AS TO WHERE DOES THAT CONSUMER GO TO. TOOK TO STILL BE ABLE TO GET FILTERED CIGARETTES BECAUSE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU'RE GONNA MOVE THAT BIGGER POPULATION AWAY FROM WHAT THEY'VE BEEN USED TO. THE IT'S COULD HAVE TO BE CONTRABAND IT'S EITHER GONNA HAVE TO BE BOUGHT OFF OF. OUR TRIBAL LAND NO TAX PAID HOUSE TO BE BOUGHT BY MAIL ORDER NO TAX PAID. ALL OF THE ALL OF THE AREAS THAT. WILL WHERE YOU CAN WILL BE ABLE TO BUY THE PRODUCT WILL BE CONTRABAND PRODUCT. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT. URINALYSIS IS VERY CORRECT THAT RIGHT NOW WITH RAISINS SURTAX. OUR COUNTRY BANDS COME BACK UP AGAIN AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE THIS WOULD JUST EXASPERATED. ARE FOR THOSE REASONS SINCE MIGHT MEMBERS ARE THE TAXPAYERS WE MUST POSE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM AND CONVENIENCE STORE ASSOCIATION OF MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN. THAT WE AGREE ACTUALLY WITH ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE THAT SAID THAT OF BEHAVIOR DOESN'T CHANGE VERY MUCH WE HAVEN'T SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR. AND WE THINK THAT THAT ACTUALLY ARGUES AGAINST THE BILL BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT OF BANNING THE FILTERED CIGARETTE SALES AS MR LOW PER POINTS OUT HEARD NINETY NINE PERCENT OF CIGARETTE SALES. IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO A SOMEHOW CHANGE THE PREFERENCE OF THOSE SMOKERS WHO ARE BUYING FILTERED CIGARETTES AND. IT CHANGED INTO A STARK CONSUMING A NON DISPOSABLE FILTER AND. A FOR A FILTER A CIGARETTE OR SMOKING A JUST A PLAIN CIGARETTE A WE THINK THAT IS MISTER LOCAL POINTS OUT OF THAT WE WILL SEE AN UPTICK. NOT ENCONTRABAN SALES. THAT WILL AT LEAST EXCEED OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE CIGARETTE TAX INCREASE AND UNFORTUNATELY. SINCE MANY OF MY MEMBERS DEPEND UPON CIGARETTE SALES FOR AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR INCOME OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEM AND IT WILL AS IT WAS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS. HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE STATE FROM THE LOSS OF THE REVENUE FOR THAT REASON THE ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF AFRICA ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION.

SUPPORT OPPOSITION OR OTHERWISE. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION MEMBERS MISTER GALLAGHER. LEARN. MR STILL NO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP WAS A PIRACY ISSUE AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS THAT IS A. POTENTIAL PROBLEM HERE YOU KNOW IT WITH THE RECENT TAX WE'VE ALREADY SEEN LOTS PEOPLE BRING IN AND OUT OF STATE. CIGARETTES THAT'S THAT'S UNDERMINE WE ARE THE SEATED THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO TESTIFIED HERE THIS MORNING. SO I SAW YOU RECOGNIZE THAT AS A PROBLEM BUT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO? YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I GUESS BECAUSE IF THAT'S A REAL SIDE EFFECT HOW CAN WE. HOW CAN WE ENFORCE THAT HOW CAN WE IN SURE THAT? THAT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE. WELL AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE PUT THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR. PENALTY IN THERE WHICH WAS ALSO SO. OPPOSED TO TO TRY AND AND SET A BAR. I THINK WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM TO FACE AND THAT'S PIRACY IN SALES OF CIGARETTES WHETHER IT'S FROM. THE TRIBES OR OUT OF STATE FOR ON LINE BECAUSE YOU ARE FROM A LOT OF BUSINESSES. THEY DEPEND ON THE SALE OF CIGARETTES REALLY FOR THEIR BUSINESS. WOULD THIS HAVE AN ADDITIONAL INCREMENT DRIVE SOME PIRACY POTENTIALLY THAT'S SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT'S WERE STARTING IN TAKING A LOOK AT. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT JUST INCREASING FINES AND PENALTIES AND. IS IS REALLY GOING TO TO DO THE JOB I THINK WE HAVE TO DO OF A BIGGER PICTURE JOB IN CALIFORNIA. AND INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE SO THAT THEY'RE MAKING. MORE INFORMED CHOICES. I WOULD THINK ANNA AND I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION HERE CHANGING THE PRODUCT HAVING NO FILTERS. ON A CIGARETTE. MIGHT DISSUADE SOME PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING TO SLOW A LOT OF FOLKS THAT I TALK TO I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THAT'S TRUE WILL LISTEN TWELVE PERCENT IT'S A DECLINING GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SMOKING. THEY'RE PRETTY DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO SMOKE. SO I I DON'T KNOW THEY PROBABLY WOULD A LOT OF THEM WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FILTER THE CIGARETTE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOUND AND DETERMINED TO. CONTINUE THAT HABIT. WOULD THEY GET IT OUT OF STATE WOULD THEY GET IT FROM THE TRIBES THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND FIGURE OUT A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY OF OF ENFORCEMENT. S. THROWING NUMBERS AND AND PENALTIES. LEADS TO MAY NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. LISA OTHER ISSUES IN SO FOR WHETHER IT'S FOR THIS BILL OR WHETHER IT'S FOR THE THE LARGER PROBLEM OF CIGARETTE PIRACY. WE. I THINK THAT'S UP TO ALL OF US TO TO. TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROTECT THE BUSINESS THAT THAT IS LOCAL IN CALIFORNIA AND IF WE ARE GOING TO SELL A PRODUCT. THAT IT STAYS. SO KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE. BE THAT SIGNIFICANT OF A DRIVER OBVIOUSLY TWO DOLLARS A PACK THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER DRIVER PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS. BASED ON THE THEIR WALLETS MORE THAN THEY DO ON THE PRODUCT AND THEY'VE BEEN SOLD. A BILL OF GOODS FOR MANY YEARS ON THE BENEFITS OF THE FILTER FILTER DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS. ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WORK THAT PRODUCTS NOT AVAILABLE BILL ITEM WILL SWITCH TO AN UNFILTERED CIGARETTE AND CONTINUE WOULD HAVE IT. THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING IN IN MY BOOK BUT I THINK THAT'S A SITUATION WE HAVE. THIS IS GONNA JUMP IN AND. CORRECT WHAT I THINK YOU MEANT TO SAY AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT YOU CONFLATED. LEGAL SALES. OF CIGARETTES ON TRIBAL LAND AND PIRACY AYE IN THE BEER YOUR COMMENTS THERE AND I THINK. THE BLACK MARKET ILLEGAL SALES OBVIOUSLY. DIFFERENT ISSUES IT ABSOLUTELY UNIFIED GETS GOOD POINT THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL SALE. OUR STATE OR A LEGAL SALE. IN A TRIBAL SITUATION RIGHT. THOSE CORRECT TO GOING OUT OF STATE WOULD BE ILLEGAL SELLING A CIGARETTE EVEN UNDER THIS BILL. ADD ON TRIBAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE ILLEGAL SO SOMEBODY DID GO AND AND ACQUIRE CIGARETTES ON TRIBAL LANDS AND THEN CAME BACK INTO CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT IT WOULD BE DOES IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE TAX ISSUE BUT. OKAY ABSENT OR CONTRIBUTES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TAX ISSUE RIGHT NOW YOUR YOUR THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY A LINE THERE SO GOING OUT OF STATE WERE TRYING TO SUPPLY. INTO CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT UNDER THIS BILL POTENTIALLY DRIVING INTO ANOTHER STATE ACQUIRING CIGARETTES AND BRINGING THEM IN FOR PERSONAL USE. IS NOT AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS IT WOULD BE. BRINGING IN CIGARETTES AND SO THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT ALL OF THE RETAILERS WHO RELY ON THE SALE OF CIGARETTES FOR THEIR BUSINESS THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN. WOULD BE PROVIDING THEM THE APPROPRIATE CIGARETTES TO SOW. AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE GETTING UNFILTERED CIGARETTES IN THE SAME QUALITY THAT THEY WERE OTHERWISE A FILTER CIGARETTES AND THOSE ARE STILL SELL SELLING. THERE'S BEEN IN THAT INSTANCE NOT IMPACT ON THE. IT CERTAINLY DOES ILLUSTRATE. THE DIFFICULTY. THAT WE FACED WITH BLACK MARKET ISSUES AROUND TOBACCO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IN THE. IT'S AN ISSUE THIS COMMITTEES VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL DECADES AS-CALIFORNIA HAS STRUGGLED TO. A REDUCE BLACK MARKET SALES I THINK THEY STILL REPRESENT SOMEONE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY PERCENT. OF TOBACCO SALES IN THE STATE. WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN BUT WE CERTAINLY MADE EFFORTS. THIS BILL DOES PRESENT. THOSE CHALLENGES. I CERTAINLY COMMEND YOU FOR CONTINUING TO TRY DRESSES ISSUE I THINK THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE. THAT BODY AGREES THAT THE LITTERING ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO STRIP MUCH IS A IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK WE CONTINUE TO DISAGREE. ON THE APPROACH. TO TAKE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. THE BLACK MARKET ISSUE. IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON MY MIND. BUT THE HOUSE IT HEALTH ISSUE ALSO ARE TO MAP I WANTED STATE DEPT YOU TO ASK THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN DIEGO YOU. RAISE THE ISSUE OF FILTERED CIGARETTES. PRESENTING AN ADDITIONAL HEALTH CONCERN OVER UNFILTERED CIGARETTES AND I'M CURIOUS IF THAT WERE THE CASE. OR IF THAT IS THE CASE AND IF THE SCIENCE. IS CLEAR ON THAT AND WHY THE FDA HASN'T TAKEN ACTIONS TO BE HIM FILTERED CIGARETTES. WHAT MY THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT? IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. ACTOR I JUST TO STEP DOWN AS DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH IN HHS AND I GET IN THAT POSITION I. CO CHAIRED WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL THE INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON THE BACK ON HEALTH I WAS BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD UNTIL. UNTIL ELECTION HAPPENED. AND THEN I HAD TO. CHANGE CHAU MY YOU KNOW MY VENUE BUT. THE. AT THE QUESTIONS I DID ASK THE FDA ON THIS. WERE. RECEIVED WITH INTEREST AND I THINK THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IN THIS ISSUE. AT WHAT THE CAME BACK TO ME. AND TERMS OF THEIR. A REASON NOT TO DO THIS IS THIS COULD BE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT THAT MAYBE A BETTER ROUTE THAN TRYING TO DEAL WITH. THE LAWSUITS THAT THEY GET AGAINST THE FTA INCESSANTLY FROM THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY THAT JUST. STOPS EVERYTHING THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY CAN AND INCREMENTAL BASIS TO REGULATE TOBACCO IN THIS ONE IT WAS OF A BIG STEP FOR THEM TO TAKE. NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN ARE. SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS OF THESE ARGUMENTS MADE THAT TRANSITIONING. CONSUMERS TO E. CIGARETTES ARE CAN HAVE SOME PERIPHERAL OR OR BYPRODUCT HEALTH BENEFIT. STRIKES ME THAT WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY HAVE. A BENEFIT IN THIS AREA IS THAT. GONNA FOCUS. FOR YOU AS WELL. WELL ON. IN THERE'S A LOT THAT'S UNKNOWN ABOUT THE. BENEFITS OR RISKS OF E. CIGARETTES AS YET THEY ARE NOT YET REGULATED. THAT'S BEEN DELAYED FOR SOMETIME ALTHOUGH THE AYE IF HE'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE. INTERESTED IN A SPECIAL WITH JEWEL THAT'S BEEN AFFECT EFFECTING YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THERE'S NOTHING GOOD ABOUT BEING ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. ADULTS OR CHILDREN AND THE CIGARETTE IS ANOTHER WAY OF BECOMING ADDICTED TO THIS TODAY KATANA MY PERSONAL OPINION ON THIS IS THAT. NOW WE NEED TO WORK AGAINST THAT CD THE FDA IS ACTUALLY WORKING TO REDUCE NICOTINE IN GENERAL DE AS THE SOURCE OF A CONTINUED SMOKING. SO THE ONLY OTHER ISSUE I I THINK IS IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT IS THAT THE CIGARETTES ARE E. WASTE. THEY'VE GOT A BATTERY THEY'VE GOT DOES SOLUTION THAT'S ACTUALLY POISONOUS. THAT YOU KNOW OF KIDS WHO GET INTO IT. ME IT IS SOMETHING I CAN BE A RISK AS WELL SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES AS WELL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DUAL USE. INTO STAINING SMOKING RATHER THAN AND IT REALLY. GETTING PEOPLE TO QUIT. NO ALSO ANOTHER STERN TEST WHERE THAT. SOME OF THE OTHER HEALTH ADVOCACY GROUPS. SUCH AS AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ARE CESSATION WORK HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. EYES THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HERE ARE THEY IN FACT NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. NO THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL AT THIS POINT THAT THE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL THEY'RE NOT THERE YET AND THE REASON IS. IS BECAUSE THIS WOULD PROMOTE ONE TYPE OF CIGARETTE OVER ANOTHER AND FOR NOT BANNING CIGARETTES ALTOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED. WHICH STRIKES ME IN THAT WHOLE HEALTH DISCUSSION THE JUST SEEMS INCONCLUSIVE AT BEST. YEAH THAT THAT THE THIRD ISSUE. THAT COMES TO MIND WAS REYES NOT DISCUSSION AND WAS ADDRESSED SOMEWHAT. WAS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS IT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THAT. WE CERTAINLY. DON'T HAVE ANY CONCLUSIVE DIRECTION. AND. YOUR FOURTH IN THAT REALLY CONCERNS HO THE BILL WERE STONE AND AND DID THE LAST TIME. WE SAW THIS BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I IS IT JUST SEEMS MISPLACED TO LAY THE BURDEN. AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE RETAILERS. RATHER THAN THE DOORSTEP OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME WHICH IS THE LETTERING. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU SHARED. REGARDING INCREASED FINES. AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL AGREE FINDS ARE ONE THING BUT FINDS NOT FORCED OR ARE LARGE LUCIOUS WE HAVE SEEN THE EDUCATION. OF FINES AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE HANDSOME SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IMPACTS AND THERE'S A DRUNK DRIVING. AND. IT SEEMS THAT THEY COULD HAVE A SIMILARLY. A POSITIVE EFFECTS IF WE WERE TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE FINE AND AND COUPLE THAT WITH SERIOUS ENFORCEMENT. EDUCATION THE SEEMS LIKE WE COULD MAKE AN IMPACT HIM TO COMMENT ON THAT YEAH. POTENTIALLY THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR CRIME OF LITTERING AND I'M NOT. I DON'T KNOW THAT. RAISING THE THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. CIGARETTE. AND THAT'S POTENTIALLY THOUSAND DOLLARS SPECIAL OUT OF A MOVING VEHICLE ESPECIALLY DURING FIRE SEASON. LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO SEE THAT. IT'S A VERY QUICK DISTINCT OR OR SMOKER ON THE BEACH OR IN A PARK OR ON OUR GROUNDS. LOOK OUT EFFECTIVE WE ARE TO FORCING IT ON OUR OWN CAPITAL GRANTS. AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S POLICED DAILY. AND YET WALKER AND NOW IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU'LL SEE CIGARETTE* EVERYWHERE THAT ACTS DROPPING IT STEPPING ON IT. IS POTENTIALLY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE DOESN'T SEEM TO IMPACTS. HERE AND THE WITH ALL THE CHP AND THE GROUNDS. CREW AND EVERYONE WHO'S HERE ON OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS. THAT ILLEGAL ACTS WITH PLENTY PEOPLE AROUND TO POTENTIALLY ENFORCED. DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO WE COULD SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE COULD ASK THEM TO GO AND FORCE. THE LITTERING LAWS. DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL NOR DO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A VERY QUICK DISCRETE ACT DRUNK DRIVING VERY DIFFERENT OTHER IMPACTS EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT. SURE CAN WORK DEPENDING ON THE CRIME. THIS IS BAD AND AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PUBLIC. OUTREACH IN FACT DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS AN AD SERIES ABOUT DON'T THROW YOUR CIGARETTE* OUT TO THE. THE GREAT DOWN THE SEWER GRATE IN AND OUT ON TO THE BEACH. THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE CHANGING THE BEHAVIOR OF ESPECIALLY THE SMALL POPULATION THAT REMAINS SMOKING. SO SOMETHING WOULD WORK THERE I'M OPEN TO MY GOAL HERE IS TO REDUCE IS TO TO TAKE THE THE MOST UBIQUITOUS ITEM A TRASH SEE HOW FAR DOWN THAT LIST WE CAN PUT IT. THIS ISN'T AN ATTEMPT I DO WAY TO DO THAT AGAIN TAKE THE PRODUCT THAT'S BEING TOSSED MAKE IT LESS HARMFUL IN THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS STILL. IN THIS AN ANALYSIS IT'S STILL OFFENSIVE. TOSS EVEN THE FILTER THE CIGARETTE*. AND AND THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY WHO ROLLS AROUND HERE THE CAPITAL THAT KNOWS ON THE THE SOUTH SIDE MORE. TO ME IT'S NOT JOINTS BECAUSE THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF MATERIAL INSIDE OF IT. BUT MORE. OF OF A FILTER LESS HAND ROLLED CIGARETTE* THAT THAT ARE OUT THERE SO THIS IS JUST. A PATTER. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A HABIT IT'S PART OF THE HABIT IT'S. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. WITH THE WORDS CAN HAVE TO. AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT THE SENSE LIKE. I BELIEVE IF WE TOOK. TWENTY CHP OFFICERS AND STARTED HANDING OUT THOUSAND DOLLAR FINES BY THE HUNDREDS AND LACKS COUPLE MONTHS OF ALL THE SUDDEN THERE'D BE A LOT LESS LETTERING ON CAPITAL GRANTS. DEPEND ON ME I WOULD HOPE SO AND AND I WOULD ENLIST YOUR HELP WITH CHP TO TO SEE IF THEY WILL COME BACK. ON. THE END AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. I JUST THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO START WITH THE PERPETRATOR OF THE LETTERING THAN IT DOES TO PLACES BURDEN AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE RETAILER. I'VE EXPRESSED THAT TO YOU IN PRIOR DISCUSSIONS ARE SUBJECT IRAQ REMAINS MY OPINION. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE S. AT LEAST MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AS A FIRST STEP IN. AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT UNUSUAL LETTERING WHICH CERTAINLY THE GOAL IS SOMETHING. WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH. ON FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ARE RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE TODAY ON ON THE BILL BEFORE US. DO WE HAVE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I BELIEVE MISTER LEVINE. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER STONE FOR THE BILL AND I JUST WANNA THINK THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE. FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION AND A LOT OF FOR PERSPECTIVES ON THIS ISSUE WHEN AND HOW TO APPROACH IT. AND. I CERTAINLY HAVE WRESTLED WITH THAT ISSUE. IN MY OWN WAY AND THEN OF COURSE WITHOUT PRIOR BELIEVE YOUR SITE HAD A BILL OF MINE TO SPANNING SMOKING ON ON BEACHES AND PARKS THAT TARA WAS VETOED. VERY RECENTLY. JUST LAST MONTH BROUGHT MY CHILDREN TO YOUR DISTRICT TO OF THE SENATE CRUZ BOARDWALK. AND THE FIRST THING MY NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ASKED ME WAS WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CIGARETTES IN THE SAN DAD. AND I DID HAVE THE HEART TO TELL HER. IT'S BECAUSE SIDE THE GOVERNOR VETOED MY BILL THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED IT. THOUGH I THINK IF I HAVE A CHANCE INTRODUCED HER TO HIM MAY BE OUT TELLER. AT THAT POINT IN THE CHAIN HIM. FOR WHAT HE DID BUT I THINK THE CHAIR. ALSO RAISES SOME REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT HOW WE POLICE OF THIS TYPE OF LITTER IN THE CHALLENGES OF ENFORCEMENT. AND. IN WHILE WE THINK THAT WE HAVE THE FORCE THAT WE NEED HERE AT CAPITOL PARK. AND OF COURSE WITH ALL THE CAMERAS AND SURVEILLANCE THAT WE HAVE. THAT THIS OP PERHAPS COULD BE A NUISANCE THAT WE RAISE VERY HIGH. AND ENFORCE AT EVEN IF WE COULD DO THAT IF IT WAS A NUISANCE THAT THAT WENT THAT HIGH. ON NOT EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA DO WE HAVE THE SURVEILLANCE AND THE FORCE TO POLICE IT AT THE LEVEL THAT WE COULD DREAM THAT WE COULD DO HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS. LIKE FIGHTS THAT TAKE PLACE AT CAPITOL PARK. THAT OCCURRED IN THE PAST YEAR THAT WE ALSO NEED TO POLICE IT'S KIND OF A HIGH NUISANCES WELL. SO. YOU KNOW IT I'VE LOOKED AT AT THIS A LOT I HAVE LISTEN TO THIS DEBATE IN A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HEARD. YOU KNOW REMIND ME OF OF SOME OTHER YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME ANALOGIES OF. HOW WE'VE DEALT WITH EMISSIONS ON CARS AND THAT WE'VE TRIED TO REGULATE EMISSIONS ON CARS IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT THE SAME TECHNOLOGY YOU? SWINGING OTHER THINGS THAT WERE USED IN THE PAST AREN'T APPROPRIATE NOW BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS. THAT WE I THINK YOU'VE ALSO BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES THE FIELD OR THE TASTE. WHICH I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE IN FACT EXTRAORDINARILY GENEROUS. TO CONSIDER ADDED THOSE ISSUES AS MUCH AS THAT BUT YOU'VE HAD. I THINK OF THE FILTER. AND IN WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE SMOKERS KNOW WHAT'S THE FRONT AND IN THE BACK END OF A CIGARETTE. IT'S A SIMPLE AS SIDE THEY DO WITH RACE CARS. YOU PUT A STICKER. HEADLIGHT ON AND YOU PRETEND THE RACE CAR HAS A HEADLIGHT YOU CAN MAKE A CIGARETTE LOOK LIKE IT HAS A FILTER SO SMOKER CAN FIGURE OUT. WHICH SIDE THEY WANT TO DRAW FROM. IF THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THAT. THERE ARE SOME OTHER POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. PERHAPS OR OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN DO ENFORCEMENT. DATA WE CAN REGULATE AT THE END OF THE WHOLESALER NOT JUST THE RETAILER AS WELL. THE MANUFACTURE COULD BE A POINT AT WHICH WE ARE WERE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T COME INTO. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE CAN BE CREATIVE ABOUT THOSE APPROACHES SO WE DON'T PUT TOO MUCH OF A. AN ONEROUS RESPONSIBILITY I GUESS ON A RETAILER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT SELLING THE WRONG. PRODUCTS MAYBE LAST YEAR'S MODEL THAT SOMEHOW MADE IT IN. OF BUT I DON'T THINK I IF WE CLEAN UP THE THE PRODUCT STREAM THAT WE CAN HELP MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS FOLLOWING THE LAW. AS WE ADOPTED AS YOU FINE TUNE THIS BILL. SO ON I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THAT TODAY HOPE TO SUPPORT IT. WHEN I IT COMES ON TO THE FLOOR SOMEDAY AND I'M PROUD TO ITS MOVE THE BILL.

SUSTAINABLE SURF AND OTHERS THAT. HAVE. EMPHASIZE AND CHAMPION THE MASSES OF PROTECTING THE OCEAN IN PROTECTING OUR COAST. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE WE WERE TRYING TO GET KELLY SLATER TO BE OUR. OUR OF MAIN WITNESS TODAY BUT THAT WE DID EVEN BETTER WE HAVE JENNIFER SAVAGE WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. AND MICHAEL STEWART WITH SUSTAINABLE SIR. RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GRAY AND DISTINGUISH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL STEWART HOW ON THE FOUNDER OF SUSTAINABLE SURF ENVIRONMENT NONPROFIT BASED IN MANHATTAN BEACH AND. I'M MARIN COUNTY. THE HISTORY OF SERVING IS CLEAR SURFING WAS INVENTED BY POLYNESIAN PEOPLES SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS AGO. AND WAS BROUGHT TO HIGH ART FORM IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. SERVING HELD NOT ONLY A DEEP CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THEM AS THE NATIONAL PASTIME BUT HAD ITS PLACE IN RELIGION AND EVEN LOCAL POLITICS TO. AT SOME AGENTS SURFING COMPETITIONS DETERMINE WHO OR WHO WOULD NOT STAND POWER SO. THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD TRY HERE'S WELL. SO IT'S FITTING THAT SERVING IS ALREADY THE STATE'S FOR. OF WHO I AND WE LOOK UPON THAT AS AN INSPIRATION. FOR THE EFFORT TO DESIGNATE SERVING AS THE OFFICIAL STATE SUPPORT A CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DESERVED THAT HONOR WHERE'S Y.. THE HISTORY OF SURFING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS BEGINS ON A HOT SUMMER DAY IN JULY. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IN THE SMALL TOWN OF SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA WERE THREE HAWAIIAN PRINCES. NAMED DAVID EDWARD AND JONAH SPARK THE IMAGINATION AND INNOVATION OF EARLY CALIFORNIANS. BY WRITING THEIR LOCALLY BUILT SURFBOARDS. CRAFTED FROM NATIVE REDWOOD TREES. WHICH BY THE WAY JUST HAPPEN TO BE THE OFFICIAL STATE TREE CALIFORNIA. BEFORE AN ADORING AND IN A MAYES CROWD. AN AUSPICIOUS START INDEED TO THE BEGINNING OF SERVE CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT EARLY SPARK IGNITED A FIRE OF INNOVATION. HEADQUARTERED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS SPREAD SUPPORT SERVING TO THE FURTHEST REACHES OF THE GLOBE. AND AS BILL A SERVING INDUSTRY WORTH OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND GROWING EVERY YEAR. SO CONSIDER THIS VERY SHORT LIST OF CALIFORNIA BASED INNOVATIONS THAT SPREAD THE CULTURE OF SURFING AND OF CALIFORNIA. AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORLD'S FIRST AIRPORT FACTORY LOS ANGELES THE WORLD'S FIRST RETAIL SURF SHOP SAN FRANCISCO. THE INVENTION OF NEOPRENE RUBBER RIGHT HIM AND IN BERKELEY INVENTION OF WET SUITS AND SENATORS. THE INVENTION OF SIR FORECASTING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S SCRIPTS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY IN SAN DIEGO. THE INVENTOR OF THE WORLD'S FIRST ECO SURFBOARD MANUFACTURING MATERIALS. SUCH AS PLANT BASED RESINS IN HAYWARD AND RECYCLE EPS FORMER IRVINE AND LASTLY. AND THE INVENTION OF THE WORLD'S FIRST HIGH PERFORMANCE ARTIFICIAL SURFING WAVE LOOK AT IT RIGHT THERE IN CALIFORNIA'S. HOW CENTRAL VALLEY IN? LA MORE AND BEING. SUSTAINABLY POWER BY P. GENIES GREEN POWER PROGRAM WHICH IS HOSTING ITS FIRST PUBLIC WORLD CLASS COMPETITION THIS WEEKEND THAT WILL BE THE OUR BLUEPRINT FOR INTRODUCING SURFING. AS THE OFFICIAL SPORT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY OLYMPICS. SO WHILE SURFING WAS INVENTED IN HAWAII AND BROUGHT TO AN ART FORM THERE. CALIFORNIA SURF CULTURE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY REINVENTING THE STATE OF THE ART OF THE SPORT. OF SURFING FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE YEARS. AS TURN IN OBSCURE PASTIME FROM A FAR AWAY PLACE INTO A GLOBAL OBSESSION. AND A POWERFUL AND POSITIVE ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR GOOD EFFORT AND THAT'S WHY SERVING SHOULD BE THE OFFICIAL STATE SUPPORT. OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREETINGS UNABLE CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JENNIFER SAVAGE IN CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION SURFRIDER HAS TWENTY CHAPTERS UP AND DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST FROM CRESCENT CITY OF NEAR THE OREGON BORDER DOWN TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND AS WELL AS BEING DEDICATED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD'S OCEAN BEACHES AND WAVES WE ARE AS ENSHRINED IN OUR MISSION STATEMENT ALSO DEDICATED TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THEM. AND NOTHING SPEAKS TO THE ENJOYMENT OF% CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN BEACHES IN WAVES AS MUCH AS THE ICONIC SPORT OF SURFING. TO BUILD ON WHAT MICHAEL SAID FROM THE TIME HAWAIIANS INTRODUCED SURFING IN CALIFORNIA ARE STATES RESIDENTS HAVE ADDED INVALUABLE ADVANCES TO THE SPORT. THE SURF INDUSTRY IN ORANGE COUNTY IS WHAT THE TECH INDUSTRY IS TO SILICON VALLEY. THE ABILITY TO PROTECT SWELLS THAT CAME OUT OF SCRIPTS IN THE PLAYER GAVE RISE TO THE GLOBAL PHENOMENON OF SURFLINE WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. ALSO IN THE SCIENCE SPENCER FIGHTERS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN A PILOT PROJECT USING SMART FANS TO DETECT OCEAN CHANGE AND. SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES. FURTHER NORTH THE EPIC WAVES OF SANTA CRUZ INSPIRED AND INNOVATION KNOWN AS THE WET SUIT WHICH IS A LIFE CHANGING INVENTION IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU'RE CLOSER REDWOODS AND YOU DO PALM TREES. IN HIS TWENTY SIXTEEN PULITZER PRIZE WINNING THEM WIRE WILLIAM FINNEGAN REALLY BRILLIANT AT THE TALES OF SURFING SAN FRANCISCO'S OCEAN BEACH. AND EVEN REMOTE HUMBOLDT COUNTY. YOU CAN FIND NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS OF THE AREA'S FIRST SURF CONTESTS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. I THE WILD RUGGED LOST COAST. WE EVEN HAVE KELLY SLATER'S MAY PULL IN THE MORNING WITHOUT WHICH A LOT HAS BEEN SAID AND IT IS REALLY EXCITING THAT WERE HAVING A WORLD CLASS THEIR CONTEST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT SURFING. IF IT AS IT IS AT HEART A DEMOCRATIC SPORT THAT REFLEXIS SPIRIT OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT. THE OCEAN LIKE CALIFORNIA'S BEACHES BELONGS TO EVERYONE. MY WORK TAKES ME ALL OVER THE COAST OF CERTAIN NEARLY EVERY COASTAL COUNTY AND STILL WORKING ON CINNAMON SANTA BARBARA. AND LA EVERY FREAK EVERY PLACE HAS ITS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THE JOY OF BEING IN THE WATER IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE. SERVINGS APPEAL RESONATES WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS REGARDLESS OF INCOME AND GENDER OR SKIN COLOR. FURTHER SURFING BRINGS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO OUR COAST THE EXPERIENCE IN COASTAL ECONOMY WHICH IS VALUED AT FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. EVERY SUMMER FAMILIES FROM INLAND AREAS PACK UP THE KIDS AND HEAD TO THE BEACH HOPPING TO THE WAYS WITH CAMMY DOWN BOARDS FROM UNCLE'S NEIGHBOR IS BIG SISTERS. SHARING THE STOVE AS IT'S KNOWN IS A TIME HONORED TRADITION IN THE SURF COMMUNITY. AN ESTIMATED TWO MILLION AMERICANS SERVED IN OVER HALF OF THOSE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. IN SHORT FROM OUR CULTURE TO OUR ECONOMY SURFING IS FULLER INTERWOVEN AND ARE STATES PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND SUB ON BEHALF OF THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WE REPRESENT WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. MELISSA WARNER BEHALF OF LACKEY IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. OUR BASEBALL FOLKS SOCCER FANS. SEE NO. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SHOULD THE MEMBERS MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR. YOU PROBABLY CAN TELL THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF SURFERS AT MY DISTRICT. IF I COULD CHANGE ENTITLEMENTS AND I HOPE YOU WOULD. LOOK INTO THAT. YOU KNOW I I I. I PRIDE MYSELF ONE DO A LOT OF SOCCER PLAYERS IN AND HAVING LOST IS A FOOTBALL CLUB IN THE BEST. SOCCER STADIUM IN THE NATION RIGHT NOW. SO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYBODY IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE NOT A TRULY DO MEAN THAT AND SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO. ESPECIALLY IF YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL. TO INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF ALL SPORTS ON FROM ALL COMMUNITIES IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT. AND. A OF SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME DISCUSSION ON HOW. I SAY WE CAN INTEGRATE THE SPORT A LITTLE BIT MORE. OKAY. THANK. THIS AYE RECORD. SO THAT LA TIMES ON ARTICLE NOT ILONGGO. THE SAYS OF SKATEBOARDING NOT SURFING SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA'S OFFICIAL STATE SUPPORT ANY COMMENTS. I LOVE SKATEBOARDING. AYE GROUP SKATEBOARDIN AND I SORT OF SKATEBOARDING BEFORE I EVER STARTED SERVING IN AND SO I THINK THAT SKATEBOARDING DESERVES AS PROPER RESPECT. BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK A STATE OF CALIFORNIA GENERALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR IDENTITY IN PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF THE IDENTITY OF CALIFORNIANS ARE. SPORTS THAT DOES COME UP IS SURFING ABOUT SKATEBOARDING I THINK SERVING IS MORE IS MORE. EMBLEMATIC OF OUR STATE AND OF OUR CULTURE AND AND AND IF YOU'LL SO MUCH MORE BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IS A HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVER BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT A LOT AND THEY THEY TAKE ON A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES THAT WOULD MATTER A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THEY'RE IN THE CONVERSATION IT IT IS A LOT BIGGER THAN JUST THE SPORT ITSELF AND AND IMPACTS A LOT MORE THAN JUST. THAN JUST PEOPLE HAVING FUN AND THERE'S LOT OF ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN THOSE LOT OF ENVIRONMENTS ON TAXES SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO BELIEVE. THAT SERVING IS MORE APPROPRIATE. MR SHARE IT ON THE WITNESS WOULD LIKE TO WITH YOUR PERMISSION SHOOK MY HAND LIKE A RESPONSE TO THE SKATEBOARDING AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED BY THIS AMERICA. I JUST WANNA TAKE KNOWLEDGE AND BRIEFLY THAT I DON'T I DON'T SKATEBOARD AFRAID TO FALL DOWN ON HARD SURFACES BUT I ADMIRE PEOPLE THAT DO THAT SKATEBOARDING WAS ACTUALLY INVENTED BY CALIFORNIA SURFERS WHO ARE LOOKING. FOR SOMETHING TO DO WHEN THAT WAS TOO FLAT TO SURF AND SO THEY TOOK ROLLERSKATING WHEELS AND GLUE THEM TO THE BOTTOM OF PLANKS CITY KID. SIMULATES SURFINGON LAND SO SKATEBOARDING DOES TIE BACK TO THE HISTORY OF SURFING IN CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T MISTER CHAIR IF I IF I CAN GO BACK AND ANSWER MISTER JONES SAWYER IS CONCERNED CERTAIN. IT THERE THERE IS A. YOU KNOW. MYSELF AND MISTER CALDERON ARE EXAMPLES OF HOW THERE IS GROWING DIVERSITY AND THE SPORT OF SURFING. THERE'S ALSO A WONDERFUL GROUP IN. IN OAKLAND. CALLED A BROWN GIRL SIR. AND. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO ADD TO THAT TESTIFIED TODAY ALSO BUT. THERE'RE PROBABLY SURFING. BUT. YOU. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. WE WANT TO SHARE THE LOVE OF THE OCEAN AND OF SURFING. WITH ALL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE KNOW LAIKA MISTER CALDERON SAID I THINK A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF SURFING IS WHEN YOU LOVE THE OCEAN. YOU WANT PROTECTED AND IS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. THAT DISTINGUISHES SURFING FROM SKATEBOARDING OR ANY OF THE SPORT. IT IT IT IS EXCESSIVE ON I WILL SAY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE GET OUT HIS BROTHER'S GUYS THAT I GREW UP WITH GUYS THAT I COMPETE AGAINST ONE OF THEM WAS ON A WORLD TOUR RIGHT NOW. WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN THE MORE CALIFORNIA ALL THIS WEEK THEY GO TO SOUTH AFRICA THEY GOT A LOT OF OTHER PLACES THAT BILL GET UP THE BUNDLE LIKE? ANYWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY TO FIFTY SURFBOARDS TO TAKE A LOOK KIDS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. UP ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND ALSO IN THIS COUNTRY TO DO SO. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WILL AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT THEY'RE THERE ARE EFFORTS BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WHEN I SEE BROTHERS ONBOARD? WE'RE GOOD. I DO ASK YOU I DO ASK YOU TO TO GOOGLE MY GOOD FRIEND SAL MASEKELA AGAIN I WILL. SO FAR WE HAVE THE SKATEBOARDING AMENDMENT THE BROTHERS ON BOARDS AMENDMENT. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. DOES THAT REALLY BRAVE UP AS YOU CAN TELL WITH MY NEW YORK ACCENT GREW UP IN THE CITY. BUT WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA MET MY HUSBAND IS A NATIVE CALIFORNIA SURFER. AND. SO I SPENT MANY WEEKEND THAT DIVERS AND SWAMI ISN'T TRESTLES AND ALL THOSE PLACES HAVE MY OWN. THE WHOLE ENSEMBLE ON BOOTIES AND. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE EVEN IN OUR ENGAGEMENT PHOTO THERE'S US AND THEN THE SIR FORUMS OF PEOPLE OR IS IT WILL LOSE THE REALLY MARRYING BETTER COURT. SO. WHEN THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED A CAME ON THE RADIO DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AND MY HUSBAND CALLED ME UP HERE. ARE YOU GONNA CHO AUTHOR THIS BLL SO. I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO BE A CALL AND WE WOULD BE HONORED THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER BIGELOW. YES. MISTER MAYOR CITY. TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF ASK FOR. AMENDMENTS HERE AND. WE HAD ACT. CONVERSATION. A REAL IN THEM. YEAH I RECOGNIZING THE HISTORY. CALDERON. RELATED THAT KILLER ISSUE. WE LOOK AT IT ACTUALLY WRITE THE THREE PRINCESSES. GREAT STORY HOW THEY CAME OVER AN EIGHT. PRIOR TO THAT RODEOS. RODEOS. IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEEN. AND WE'RE RIGHT HERE AT THE STATE CAL. AND THEIR ORIGINS ARE NOT NECESSARILY FROM CALIFORNIA. MUCH LIKE THE. HAWAIIAN TECHNIQUES OF. SURFING. ARE REALLY NOT THE REAL ORIGINS YOU ACTUALLY COME FROM. EARLIER DAYS IN TAHITI SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZE HOW THIS IS MORE OF BUT CALIFORNIA'S BECOME AN EPICENTER AND RODEOS ARE ONE OF THE KEY. COMPONENTS TO A SUCCESSFUL SPORTS VENTURE IN. THE WESTERN WAY OF LIFE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN'T GET TO THE NATIONAL FINALS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH CALIFORNIA. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IF YOU WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. AND AMENDMENT RECOGNIZING. THE RODEO LIGHTEN. THE RODEO SKILLS. AND THEY'RE TIED TOGETHER. BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE ONE COMMENT DAY. YOU HAVE TO HANG ON. OKAY AND I WILL SAY THAT WE WERE DESIGNATED AS THE STATE'S POOR BUT THERE'S ALSO DESIGNATIONS THAT YOU CAN DO INDIVIDUAL SPORTS IN TEAM SPORTS. TALK TO TOM WE GOT THAT BUT I FUNDS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER. I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ALSO THAT THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE. MORE THAN ONE OFFICIAL SPORT I DON'T WANT TO. MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS BUT THE. AS THE COMMITTEE MAY REMEMBER A CERTAIN FIND LEGSLATOR FROM THE SAME WORKING DOUBLY. CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WITH ONE STATE NOT. AND WALKED OUT WITH FOUR STATEMENTS HAVE NOT. THIS IS A MATTER OF HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY. FOR THOSE THAT ARE NEW TO THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE. THE QUESTION FOR MR CUP. YEAH. ON BEHALF OF ALL THE. BEACH VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A. NOT THAT I'M BLIND IT AND CERTAINLY CANCER BODY CERTAINLY DOES THAT COUNT BUT UNLIKE SERIOUSLY. THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR. JUST LAYING DOWN AND BODY SERVERS BODY BOARDERS ALL CONSIDERED SURFING OKAY VERY GOOD SO I I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD. A VOLLEY. SOFTBALL SOCCER. THE FOOTBALL AND. BASEBALL WOMEN FORGETTING BASKETBALL THE SUPER MALL IN THERE BUT SURFING IS DEFINITELY ICONIC FOR CALIFORNIA DON'T FORGET THE SNOWBOARDERS WHICH IS WHERE YOU GUYS GO IN THE WINTER WRITING. SO WE CAN'T FORGET THAT. OUR FRIENDS UP IN AMOUNTS BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET LET A GREAT SPORTS. MR LEVINE. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THINKS RECOUNTING THE. THAT THE FOR STATE THAT'S THAT WE'VE GOT BECAUSE I WAS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE'RE. INCLUSIVE. IF YOU WILL NOT BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SURFING BEING THE STATE'S. WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING OUR COAST. WE'RE TALK ABOUT PROTECTING THE WATERWAYS WERE TALK NOT KEEPING IT CLEAN. YOU KNOW THE EXTRAORDINARY ENVIRONMENTAL ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS THAT ARE GOOD FOR ALL OF US. AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SURFING AS A STATE SPORT WE ALSO AS WAS TALK ABOUT WAS THAT A MESSAGE OF INCLUSION. BEST SURFING IS A SPORT FOR EVERYONE AND THAT. THE BEACH IS FOR ALL OF US. AND WE MUST COMMIT TO DO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO OUR BE. OUR BEACHES TO OUR COASTS AND TO THE SPORT OF SURFING AS WELL AND THAT. IT HOWEVER WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT THAT SPORT IS INFUSED WITH INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PEOPLE COMING TO THE BEACH TO SURF. YOU KNOW. IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING WE WE HEAR TIME AND AGAIN ABOUT DIFFERENT SPOTS WHO WHERE THE LOCALS ARE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THAT ONE SPOT. DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE THERE. AND THAT IS THE THE LEAST. PROBABILITY THE LEAST REPRESENTATIVE ATTITUDE OF OF WHAT A TRUE SIR FOR IS. AND AS MUCH AS WE CAN PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT SURFING IS FOR EVERYONE AND EVERYONE IS WELCOME IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL. YEAH AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO DO IT IMMINENT THREE OTHER THAN A STATE. TO GO AND SERVE. EIGHT YOU ANYBODY SO TO BE TOO BIG TO DO AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SUPPORTED ONE OF I SUPPORT WHAT YOU THAT'S EXPENSIVE. BUT I THINK RELATIVELY TO THE OTHER SPORTS IT'S A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND IT'S IT'S ACTION YOU CAN BORROW AND YOU CAN RENT. YOU KNOW TO LEARN IT AND SETS IT BUT I THINK THAT THE POINT REALLY I WANT TO MAKE IS. IF WE'RE PUSHIN THE SPORT AS SOMETHING THAT'S THE STATE. SPORT RECOGNIZED SOMETHING FOR MARKETING. ABOUT HOW GREAT CALIFORNIA IS IN IT'S TRUE. THAT IT GETS DOWN TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL SURFER THAT THEIR BEACH IT'S FOR EVERYBODY. YEAH ALTHOUGH I HAVE A. ONE OF THE. NOTORIOUS SPEECH IS. IN IN MY DISTRICT WILL NOT OBEY. THERE IS A A GANG OF SURFERS DILLON ON BAY BOYS THAT. WELL I I HEAR THAT THEY'RE BUILDING GO. TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR FORD. BACK. PALS VERITIES COAST BETTER.
