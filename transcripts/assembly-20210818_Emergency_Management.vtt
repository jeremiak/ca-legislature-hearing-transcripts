FIRST ONE BEING THIRTY SIX

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:44.809
HOURS I'M VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE

AN EVENT GOING THAT LONG. THE

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.379
AREA THAT IT OCCURRED IN IS

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:52.183
VERY- ITS BORDER THE TAP

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.518

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.203
OVERNIGHT. BUT IT WAS A VERY

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.306
DYNAMIC- A BAT WHICH REQUIRE

OUR AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY

00:36:19.176 --> 00:36:21.846
INCLUDING MY SQUAT TEAM THE

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:23.981
REGIONAL POLICE SWAT TEAM. BUT

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:27.151
ALSO- SWAT TEAMS FROM KERN

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:29.053
COUNTY IN KINGS COUNTY ALSO

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.955
RESPONDED TO ASSIST IN DAY TO

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.257
JUST PURELY BECAUSE OF FATIGUE

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:35.393
AND ALSO THE F. B. I.'S ALEX

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:39.130
WHAT TEAM. I WAS ON GROUNDS AS

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:42.199
WELL. SO WHAT CHANGES HAVE WE

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.468
MADE OR WHAT WERE WHAT WE

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:47.738
IDENTIFIED REALLY- A FEW KEY

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:51.208
AREAS THAT NEEDED- NEED WORK.

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.777
NUMBER ONE SELF DEPLOYMENT

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.612
WHICH SEEMS A SIGNIFICANT

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:56.514
PROBLEM IN MOST MAJOR SHOOTINGS

00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.418
WHERE AGENCIES RESPOND THEN-

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:01.452
AND YOU'RE UNAWARE THAT THEY'RE

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:03.154
THEY'RE SO COMMUNICATIONS

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.122
BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM. WHEN

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:06.123
YOU'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.892
AGENCIES WE FOUND WE HAD TO

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.493
HAVE LIISONS WITH EACH OF

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.796
THOSE TEAMS- BECAUSE THEY

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:12.229
DIDN'T HAVE DIRECT

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.065
COMMUNICATION WITH US BUT HE

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:16.100
MEDICATIONS IS DEFINITELY A

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.502
PROBLEM AND I THINK ALWAYS WILL

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.571
BE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.607
SAW ONE WHERE IT COMES TO SELF

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:25.710
DEPLOYMENT IS THAT. WE HAVE SO

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:28.045
TRAINED WE'VE TRAINED FOR SO

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:30.414
MANY YEARS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER-

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:35.052
OUR RESPONSES BECOME- I GUESS

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:40.291
VERY- VERY SAD AND THIS

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:42.393
PARTICULAR INCIDENT. WHEN A

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.395
SECOND SHOOTING HAPPENED IN THE

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:47.698
SECOND DAY- OFFICERS WERE

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:50.768
COMING IN- FORMING TEAMS AND

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.571
DEPLOYING INTO AN AREA THAT WAS

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:55.239
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF.

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.975
OF COVER AND AYE CONCEALMENT

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:00.244
FOR THE SHOOTER AND REALLY-

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:03.347
LACK OF FAMILIARITY BY THE

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:05.282
RESPONDING OFFICERS AND SO THEY

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:06.384
WERE TREATING IT AS AN ACTIVE

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.519
SHOOTER IN ESSENCE GOING INTO A

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:11.088
BUILDING. WHEN IT WAS REALLY

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:13.557
AND AT A POINT WHERE. IT NEEDED

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.926
TO BE- THE PRIMER NEEDED RESET

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.361
AND THEN A PLANNED RESPONSE

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.764
WITH SWAT TEAMS SO ONE OF OUR

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.298
BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE PEOPLE

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:24.001
SOFT POINT INTO. THE HOT AREA-

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:27.138
WITHOUT ANY. WITHOUT ANY

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.906
ASSISTANCE OR GOT ANY-

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:32.510
KNOWLEDGE. OF WHAT THEY'RE

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.011
WALKING INTO- SO TRYING TO GET

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:37.214
THAT MINDSET- TO YOU KNOW TO

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:38.449
DON'T MOVE IN WITHOUT

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:41.252
DIRECTION- REPORT AND

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.319
COMMUNICATE WHO YOU ARE WHERE

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:45.256
YOU ARE- WAS PRETTY VITAL AND

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:48.659
IN THE FIRST- SHOOTING. SO

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:50.261
MOVING FORWARD WITH TRAINING

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:52.596
AND WE FOUND THAT THE REGIONAL-

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:55.499
SWAT TEAM- NEEDS MORE TRAINING

AS WE STARTED OUTLINING SOME

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.832
USEFUL TERMINOLOGY FOR US. LIKE

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.100
MOST YEARS DICTION SACRAMENTO

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.202

LINEOUTS AND BASIC TERMINOLOGY

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.525
THAT WAS USEFUL FOR US. THE

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:36.559
FIRST THING THAT WE CAME ACROSS

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.461
WAS THE- TERM SECURE WE FOUND

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.763
THROUGH THESE DRILLS THAT THERE

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.365

THAT UP WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:07.557
GO AND IF THE THREAT HAS BEEN

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.925
SUPPRESSED OUR JOB IS TO GET

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.993

HOT AND COLD STONES WERE

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.048

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.622
SETTINGS WITH A MUCH SO WE WENT

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:13.422

COURT WHERE WE USED DJS TURN

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:36.239
OFF LIGHTS WE BASICALLY RAIN

FOUND THAT- LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:40.943
AMAZING THEIR JOB THEY SUPPRESS

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.245
THE THREAT VERY QUICKLY IN

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.714
THESE DRILLS- FIRST OF SUCH A

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.249
HARD TIME MOVING VICTIMS IN A

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.483
TIMELY MANNER WHEN THE NUMBERS

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.318
GOT HOT. IN THIS TRIAL WE LIKE

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.786
SAID WE HAD OVER FIFTY LIVE

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:52.321
PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTY SIX IN

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.789
THE NEEDED TO BE. MOVED OUT

MANUALLY AND PREPPED FOR

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.659
TRANSPORT. THAT'S WHEN WE

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.994
STARTED TO ADJUST OUR EQUIPMENT

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.262
IF YOU LOOK DOWN ON THE BOTTOM

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.463
RIGHT HAND CORNER YOU'LL SEE

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.531
WHAT IT'S CALLED FOXTROT. THIS

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.367
IS THE BASIC TRACKS FLOOD. THIS

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.769
ALLOWS US TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.071
THAT AREA QUICKLY. WE WANT TO

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.040
THESE FOR EVERY RIG IN THE-

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:13.009
SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT. OUR

NUMBERS DROP SIGNIFICANTLY OUR

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.280
TIME FRAMES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.015
WHEN WE STARTED USING THESE TO

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.851
QUANTIFY THAT. WE'RE ROUGHLY

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:22.852
FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO GET

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:26.822
VICTIMS OUT OF THE BUILDING. IF

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:28.591
MANUALLY WITH JUST FIREFIGHTERS

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.626
TO GET TO PERSON KERRY OR IN A

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:33.062
DIAMOND FORMATION. WHEN WE PUT

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.631
THE FOXTROT IN THE PLAY. WE ARE

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:36.999
TIMES WENT FROM FORTY FIVE

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.201
MINUTES TEN TO TWELVE MINUTES.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.203
WHICH IS VERY FAST. NUMBER

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.039
ALTERNATE GOALS TO GET ONE OF

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.573
THESE VICTIMS TO SURGERY IN

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.975
LESS THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES.

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.910
SURGERIES WHAT TRULY SAVES

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.612
THEIR LIVES. SO WHEN WE'RE UP

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.747
AGAINST THE CLOCK. GETTING THEM

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:52.581
OUT OF THE OF THE EXCELLENT

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.950
FAST IS KEY. WE KNEW THAT WE'RE

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.385
MAKING PROGRESS WE STARTED

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.487
SEEING OR TIMES DROP DOWN. INTO

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.289
THE TWELVE MINUTES ON. THIS

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.458
PARTICULAR DRILL HERE AT THE

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.760
NIGHT CLUB IN SACRAMENTO OKAY.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.329
WHERE WE HAD OVER FIFTY PEOPLE

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.097
IN THEIR TWENTY SIX PEOPLE CAME

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:11.067
OUT ON THE STREET. IN ABOUT

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.635
SEVEN MINUTES WITH THE FOXTROT.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.904
REPRINTS FORTY EVERY VICTIM TO

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.272
THE HOSPITAL WITH THE DOWNTOWN

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:17.606
AMBULANCES IN TWENTY SIX

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.041
MINUTES. WHICH MEANT THAT WE

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:25.448
WERE NOW HITTING OUR OBJECTIVES.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.282
USING SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS. WE

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.383
A LOT FROM THE DRILLS. AND WE

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.484
TRULY DIDN'T LIKE A SCIENTIFIC

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:29.318
EXPERIMENT. MEANING THAT

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:30.986
OBSERVE MEASURED AND- WE HAD

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.656
PROCTORS AT EVERY CORNER OF

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.124
RECORDING DATA HOW QUICKLY

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.625
FIREFIGHTERS BACK INTO THE ROOM

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.260
WHEN TOURNIQUETS WERE APPLIED

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.929
WHEN CHEST DEALS WERE APPLIED.

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.097
IN THE AND HOW QUICKLY THE

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.331
VICTIMS WERE MOVED OUT ONTO THE

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:44.233
STREET. BY MEASURING EVERY

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.901
ASPECT OF THIS THAT ALLOWED US

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.471
TO REALLY HONE OUR TACTICS. AND

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.638
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:52.007
LEARNED. BY GOING TO THIS WAS

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.743
THAT THE- RESCUE TASK FORCE

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.678
THAT A GREAT JOB OF GETTING US

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.213
INTO THE THREAT ZONE. IT IS

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.315
VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE VICTIMS

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.816
OUT IN THE STANDARD TIME IN

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.985
FORMATION. LEFT INSIDE OF THE

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:05.621
SCREEN. YOU'LL SEE THE BASIC

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.323
PLAYBOOK OF RESCUE TASK FORCE

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:08.824
WHICH IS THREE TO FOUR

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.793
FIREFIGHTERS REST ARE ESCORTED

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.761
IN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.396
VICTIMS. AND A DIAMOND

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.697
FORMATION IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.565
GETTING PEOPLE IN. BUT IT'S

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:18.868
VERY HARD TO GET VICTIMS OUT IN

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:20.636
THAT FORMATION WE KNOW THAT

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.105
NOW. THAT THE CREW OF FOUR

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.940
FIREFIGHTERS CAN EASILY PULL

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.910
OUT FIVE VICTIMS THEY MAX OUT

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.445
AT ABOUT TEN VICTIMS SO IF YOU

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.280
HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.949
IN A BUILDING OR ZONE YOU HAVE

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:34.950
TO BRING IN A HIGH NUMBER OF

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:40.222
FIREFIGHTERS. SIMMERED BETWEEN

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:40.823
TWELVE TO TWENTY. WE RECOGNIZE

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.358
THE DRILL THAT. WE EVERYTHING

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.660
WE UP IN A POOR SO COULD START

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.662
OFF IN A DIAMOND. BUT WE ALWAYS

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.731
WOUND UP IN A SECURE CORE PLAN

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.633
VICTIMS OUT. SO WE SAID WHY

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.334
DON'T WE JUST START LIKE THAT.

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.136
IF LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPRESSES

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:55.905
THE THREATEN SET UP TO SECURE

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:58.774
CORRIDOR ESCORTS AT SPIN. WILL

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.376
BE MUCH FASTER MEMBERS OPENLY

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:03.045
WHERE WE WOUND UP. IN ABOUT THE

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.580
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WAS

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.015
USING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SET UP

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.616
SECURE CORRIDOR BRINGING IN

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.885
FIREFIGHTERS IN HIGH NUMBERS-

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:11.520
WITH THEIR FOXTROT TO REMOVE

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.222
VICTIMS. AND THAT'S WHEN WE

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:16.692
GOT. VERY FAST WE TRIED THIS.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.527
TACTIC WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.197
INCLUDING CHP. WE DO TO TEACH

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.300
HER D. AV DHS DRILL AT CALPERS

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:26.602
IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. AND OUR

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:29.238
TIMES WERE VERY FAST WE HAD

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.139
FIFTEEN LINE VICTIMS OUT ONTO

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:33.609
THE STREET. IN SIX MINUTES- SO

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.877
IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO SET UP

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:39.915
SECURE QUARTER OR- TO MOVE

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.150
THESE VICTIMS OUT. THIS IS A

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.818
REAL SIMPLE PRE OUT ON WHAT

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.053
WE'VE LEARNED SUCKING REACHING

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.321
AND THE PROGRESSION THE FIRE

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.890
SERVICE. WE THROUGH OUR

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.758
OBSERVATIONS WE KNOW ONE PERSON

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:50.793
IS VERY EFFECTIVE AT

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.528
SUPPRESSING THE THREAT NOW. ARE

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.331
QALINGE IS. GETTING INTO THE

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.966
THREAT ZONE CONTROL IN THAT

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:57.733
MEETING AND THEN GETTING

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.969
VICTIMS TO THE HOSPITAL IN LESS

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.071
THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF OUR

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:04.206
TACTICS ARE TOO SLOW. AND IT

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.508
TAKES US AN HOUR TO GET PEOPLE

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:07.476
OUT OF THE BUILDING- THEN WE'RE

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.777
NOT MEETING OUR OVERALL MISSION

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:10.546
WHICH IS STOPPING THE TIME.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.348
THROUGH THESE DRILLS AND WE

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:15.184
STILL CONDUCT THEM- AT TACTICAL

COLLABORATING WITH MULTIPLE

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.531
AGENCIES HAS TAUGHT US A LOT TO

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:30.733
USE THOSE BASIC TERMS. OF

WORK YOU'VE DONE- WE ALWAYS

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.700
WANT ME. HOW THE SHOOTING SEVEN

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.301
SEAT AROUND THE COUNTRY- YOU

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:40.569
YOU ALWAYS HOPE IS NOT YOUR

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:43.339
HOME TOWN AND ON FORCING WITH

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.975
THE VTA SHOOTING A WAS AND- SHE

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.243
COULD NOT- WAS. CHEN HAD BEEN

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.846
CHIEF AT THAT POINT DOESN'T

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:51.847
JUST LESS THAN A HANDFUL MONTHS

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.383
AND- HIS LEADERSHIP AND

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.319
LEADERSHIP AND- THE QUICK

01:10:57.386 --> 01:11:00.456
ACTION. OF AS HE INDICATED

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.091
MULTI JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSE.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.793
RESPONSE WAS CRITICAL THAT DAY

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.762
BUT I THINK TO HIS POINT OF

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:07.363
THIS OF THE COMES UP AND HAS

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.264
COME UP OFTEN AND I'M AND I'M

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.634
SURE- VICE CHAIR HAS WHAT IS A

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.868
LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS IS THE

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:16.005
COMMUNICATIONS- ASPECT OF NOT

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:19.141
BEING ON A SINGLE CHANNEL- A

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.976
NUMBER IS REALLY KEEN I THINK

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.678
OF THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THAT

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.380
SOMETHING THAT- WE'VE HEARD

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.115
BEFORE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:27.483
GONNA BE A TAKE AWAY THAT WE

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.351
CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM THIS

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.420
MEETING AND- AND LEAVE ON THE

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.389
TABLE- BECAUSE WE SEE IT TIME

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.424
AND AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY. EVERY

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.292
TIME THERE'S A SHOOTING-

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.762
INFORMS US WELL WE'VE BEEN

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:40.562
EDUCATED MORE THAN WE'VE EVER

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.464
WANTED TO- OVER THE LAST FEW

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:43.465
FEW A FEW YEARS THROUGHOUT THE

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:46.201
STATE. BUT I THINK THAT MESSAGE

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.302
I THINK IN EVERY ONE OF THESE

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.605
INSTANCES KEEPS COMING UP. IS

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:50.572
THAT UNIFIED WE HAVE THE

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:51.774
TECHNOLOGY IS WE HAVE THE

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.742
UNIFIED TOGETHER AND SO I

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.444
REALLY APPRECIATE SHE BOUGHT

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.713
THE FOR REITERATING THAT-

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.149
BECAUSE I THINK- YOU KNOW BUT I

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:05.387
THINK. THAT THAT'S WHERE AN

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:06.689
INTO A- THE CCI SAILORS. IN OF

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.690
MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN PEOPLE.

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.124
WITH ALL THAT. IT'S ALL ABOUT

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.859
WHAT HOW COULD PROCESS COULD BE.

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.661
AND THAT THE SITUATION. IS AT

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.396
LEAST THE BEST OF. THE BEST

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.998
ABILITY POSSIBLE EITHER

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.366
COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZED OR AT

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:21.036
LEAST ISOLATED SO THAT- SHE

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.338
SAILORS AND HIS MEN AND WOMEN.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:24.406
CAN GET THE FOLKS AND GET HIM

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:25.941
TO THE HOSPITAL SO I THINK

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.911
THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:29.978
HOLDING THIS HEARING BUT I

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.046
THINK THAT MEANS A LOT WE CAN

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.514
TAKE FROM THIS THAT. I LOOK

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:33.449
FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP ON

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.184

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.529
TAKE SOMETHING OUT HERE THAT WE

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:48.997
CAN DO TO HELP MAKE THESE

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.833
THINGS BETTER. AND FROM THE

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.568
STATE'S PERSPECTIVE THAT MEANS.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.002
MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THE

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:56.638
INFRASTRUCTURE- INVESTMENTS

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:59.475
THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.043
OUR TECHNOLOGY IS UP TO SNUFF

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:05.247
AND- AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:05.848
AS IS POINTED OUT HIS

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:09.284

THE INTEROPERABLE IT ISSUE

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.495
WITH. WITH OUR RADIOS ARE

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.097
PORTABLE RADIOS. IT IS BEEN

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.366
GOING ON FOR I THINK THE EFFORT

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.534
HAS BEEN A BIG PUSH FOR THE

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.369
LAST DECADE AND A HALF AT

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:32.241
LEAST. AND IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:34.610
IS A TRAINING ISSUE STILL OR

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.079
THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.547
STRUGGLING OR WERE HAVING

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.215
TRANSMISSION TOWER ISSUES AND

WE'RE WE'RE NOT HAVING ENOUGH.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.452

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:47.256
WITH- ABOUT I THINK IT WAS SIX

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.758
OR SEVEN YEARS AGO AND- WHICH

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.861
WOULD REQUIRE MORE- CELL TOWER

THE PROBLEM WITH COMMUNICATION

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.340
IS IT BOILS DOWN TO DISCIPLINE

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.876
OR IS IT. IS IT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.678
INVESTMENT THAT'S NEEDED HOW

COMMITMENT THAT COMMUNICATION

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:16.418
ISSUE BETTER BECAUSE THAT IS

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:19.621
THE WHOLE KEY TO. IF YOU ARE A

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:20.556
INCIDENT COMMANDER AND YOU

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.458
DON'T HAVE COMMUNICATION THEN

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:26.428

TO INVEST. THEN CERTAINLY

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:34.803
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.572
WE SHOULD START LOOKING AT

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.875
DOING. MORE OF. SURE I CAN I

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:41.510
CAN START HERE AND ON OUR END

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.979
HERE IS AT. THE INTER

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:46.081
OPERABILITY IS WORKING WHILE

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.584
YOU'RE A SUCKER COUNTY- AND I

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.117

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:01.096
THESE- EXISTENCE I KNOW WE WERE

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.498
ALL SET TO GO TO A CHANNEL.

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.400

OR TO DIRECT INCOMING RESOURCES

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.742
AS TO WHAT TO DO- BUT- I THE

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:17.279
INFRASTRUCTURES THERE. AND IT'S

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.847
BEING UPDATED CONSTANTLY.

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.482
HOWEVER AT THIS IS YOUR

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.317
MENTIONS IT FOR US IT COULD BE

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.820
A DURING HIS TRIP. TO ENSURE

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.622
THAT. WE'RE ON THE SAME CHANNEL

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.857
AND- WE HAVE THIS RIGHT TODAY

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:30.259
SEKHON PLANS FOR YOU GUYS

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:31.760
BEFORE WELL YOU'RE RESPONDING

HAVE A COMP PLAN WHEN YOU GET

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:37.432
THERE- BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:38.000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:40.202
REALLY HELPFUL- IN THE COUNTY

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.104
WAS IN L. A. COUNTY WAS. AT

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.373
HAVING A COMP PLAN BEFORE WE

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.174
EVEN GOT ON SCENE- THAT THE-

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.776
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER WOULD

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.811
ALREADY REQUESTED AND HAVE IT

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.179
SO EVERYBODY HAD IT ON THERE

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:56.351
INDICATE. THAT WHAT THE COMP

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:57.786
PLAN WAS. WELL TO CHECK IS IF

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:58.553
YOU HAVE OF THOSE BY THE I KNOW

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.122
THAT- I CAN MENTION MAJORITY

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.024
OUR RESOURCES ARE COMING IN.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.992
THE SENSE OF WHERE SAN JOSE.

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.894
AND WE WERE ALL ON OUR CHANNEL

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.896
THERE. NORMAL CHILD FOR THAT

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:12.134
AREA. AND WE ASKED EVERYBODY-

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.102
SWITCH THAT CHANNEL AND-

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.905
SOMEWHERE AND SO. RIGHT AND FOR

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:19.174
THE SHERIFF FROM FROM SAN LUIS

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.343
OBISPO IT WAS ONE OF YOUR-

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.444
CHIEF DOWN THERE IN A ROW

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.146
GRANDET BELIEVE. WAS REALLY

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:26.381
HEAVY INTO HELPING WITH THIS

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:29.318
INTER OPERABILITY PUSH- IT IS

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.619
THE INTER OPERABILITY WHILE

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.020
IT'S REALLY GOOD UP AND SAN

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.923
JOSE IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS-

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.125
CARRYING ON STATEWIDE OR DO WE

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:39.695
HAVE STILL AREAS THAT ARE

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.064
DEFICIT IN THIS. WELL I THINK-

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.732
I AGREE WITH WHAT THE CHIEF

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:46.468
SAID FIRST- I THINK A LOT OF IT

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:51.707
IS. IS EITHER OPS PLAN OR- YOU

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:55.177
KNOW TRAINING. BORE US- WE DO

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.979
HAVE GOOD INTER OPERABILITY

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.381
WITHIN THE COUNTY SO ALL OF OUR

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.882
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND WE

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.084
DO HAVE AN OFFICE PLAN IN THE

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.151
SENSE THAT THERE WHEN THEY

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.153
RESPONDED THEY'RE DIRECTED TO

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:05.954
WHAT CHANNEL THEY'RE OPERATING

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.490
ON- THERE'S TWO CHALLENGES THAT

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.892
I SEE NUMBER ONE. IS WHEN YOU

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.928
YOU KNOW WE'VE TAKEN AREA LIKE

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.696
SAN JOSE OR EVEN US WHEN YOU

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.932
HAVE ALL THOSE AGENCIES YOU

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:20.836
HAVE. YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.971
EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:25.240
PEOPLE ON THE SAME CHANNEL-

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:28.310
WHICH BECOMES AN ISSUE BUT I

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.645
THINK WHERE YOU GUYS COULD COME

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:32.047
INTO PLAY AT LEAST FROM MY

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:34.783
PERSPECTIVE IS. IS C. H. P. FOR

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.386
EXAMPLE- THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:39.254
OPERATING ON OUR CHANNEL AND

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.056
HAVING THOSE CAPABILITIS I

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.224
THINK ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.359
WE WORK VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:48.397
STAGE BE IN OUR AREA ON A DAILY

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.364
BASIS WE CAN. EDUCATE RACKLEY

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.766
WITH THERE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:53.068
THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY BUT YOUR

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:55.170
BASIC- STAGE BE A TROLL

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:58.440
OFFICER- THAT IS AN ISSUE-

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.975
FEDERAL PARTNERS ANOTHER ISSUE

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.344
BUT OUR ISSUE IN PARTICULAR OUR

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.546
FIRST ONE WAS. IS HAVING
