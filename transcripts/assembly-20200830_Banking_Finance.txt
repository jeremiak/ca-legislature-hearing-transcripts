SO WE WILL HAVE YOU START SOME MEMBER HOLDEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE TODAY. WELL WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU- I ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS A CRISTINA GARCIA AND DAVID CHIU FOR JOINING OFFERING AS WELL AS ALWAYS RATES AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. TO THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WHEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA SENATOR HUESO AND I WERE CHAIRS OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS LATINO CAUCUS AND BLACK CAUCUS. WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND GENDER DISPARITIES AT TECH COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY. THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THERE ARE FEW COMPANIES HAVE ACTED UPON THEIR COMMITMENTS TO DIVERSITY SEVERE THIS UNDER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN THE TECH INDUSTRY HAVE CONTINUED TO THIS DAY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO TECH COMPANIES. WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE UNDER REPRESENTED ACROSS WHITE COLLAR INDUSTRIES ESPECIALLY AT THE MANAGERIAL AND EXECUTIVE LEVELS. A RESPONSE TO THE PERVASIVE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF MINORITIES AND FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF SENATOR JACKSON'S SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF ONE DIRECTOR FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITY ON ALL BOARDS OF PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF TWENTY. TWENTY ONE. THE BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF TWO DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES FOR BOARDS THAT HAVE FIVE TO EIGHT DIRECTORS. AND THREE DIRECTORS FOR BOARDS WITH MORE THAN NINE DIRECTORS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF STATISTICS HAS REPORTED THAT IN UNITED STATES WERE WHITE. WHAT CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON HAVING A MAJORITY MINORITY POPULATION AND ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE CORPORATIONS DO NOT REFLECT THE VAST CULTURAL WEALTH OF THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE TOP TEN CALIFORNIA BANKS ONLY 30% OF DIRECTORS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS IS CYSTIC PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE 67% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION THAT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE CAN ALSO LOOK TO SILICON VALLEY FOR EXAMPLES OF UNDER REPRESENTATION. ON AVERAGE BLACK AND LATINO TECH EMPLOYEES MAKE UP LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. OF WORKERS AT A PREMIUM COMPANIES SUCH AS GOOGLE APPLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN. THIS PERCENTAGE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE ROUGHLY GRADUATES THAT ARE BLACK OR LATINO. A LOT OF RECENT SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE FOR- PROTEST CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF THEIR WORKFORCE THAT HAVE MADE PROMISES TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. MANY TECH COMPANIES. A BEGAN WHICH WE BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN YET PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING HIRED AND PROMOTED HAS NOT CHANGED. ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAKE UP A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE WHITE COLLAR WORKFORCE BUT AT THE LEAST BUT ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED AND MOVE UP THE LADDER. A RECENT REPORT BY THE MCKINSEY AND COMPANY SHOWS THAT COMPANIES WITH A DIVERSE WORK FORCE AND A DIVERSE CORPORATE BOARD PERFORMED BETTER THAN BOARDS WITHOUT DIVERSITY. YET THE FACE OF THE WHITE COLLAR EMPLOYEE REMAINS UNCHANGED. BY CHANGING THE CORPORATE BOARD TO CHANGE THE COMPANY'S CULTURE. A DIVERSE BOARD CONTRIBUTES TO A COMPANY THAT VALUES DIVERSITY THANK A READILY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF ITS WORKFORCE AND CUSTOMER BASE. WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE RACIAL INJUSTICE AND INEQUITY IN OUR SOCIETY PEOPLE OF COLOR MUST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WERE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF WEALTH IS BASED. ESPECIALLY THE STATE AS VERSUS CALIFORNIA. CURLED UP GUARDINO GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND POLICY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BLOOM ENERGY AND BUCK G. DIRECTOR OF THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVE INITIATIVE EXECUTIVE ADVISOR TO ASCEND. WILL PROVIDE TESTIMONY I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. YOU THANK YOU SOME MEMBER HOLDEN AT WE DO HAVE THE SUPPORT IN AND I WANT TO CONFIRM YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF YOUR OTHER JOINT AUTHORS DOESN'T KNOW THAT. NO ALL RIGHT I SUPPOSE AND WE DO HAVE SOME SUPPORT WITNESSES- AND I REMIND THE SUPPORT WITNESSES THAT THEY HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE. MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH CARL GUARDINO WHO WILL TESTIFY AND ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE SEVEN NINE. THANK YOU CHAIR LIMON MY NAME IS CARL GUARDINO EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT GLOBAL GOVERNMENT. AT YEAH MY CHAIR LIMóN CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR LIMóN MY NAME IS CARL GUARDINO EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND POLICY AT BLOOM ENERGY AS YOU MAY KNOW BLOOM ENERGY AS A CLEAN ENERGY COMPANY THAT WAS FOUNDED IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY NINETEEN YEARS AGO WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CONDUCTED. RIGHT HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE BLOOM ENERGY WAS FOUNDED BY OUR VISIONARY CEO K. R. SRIDHAR WHO IS NOT ONLY COMMITTED TO BUILDING A GREAT COMPANY. EQUALLY A GREAT CULTURE THAT VALUES DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. OF OUR NINE MEMBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS ONE THIRD ARE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ONE THIRD OF OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM OF WHICH I'M HONORED TO SERVE IS FEMALE AND ONE THIRD ARE ETHNIC MINORITY. MORE THAN HALF OF BLOOM ENERGY'S U. S. EMPLOYEES UNTIL A CERTAIN ARE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. THAT BLOOM ENERGY WE KNOW THAT A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND DIVERSE LEADERSHIP MAKES FOR A DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUNDS EXPERIENCES POINTS OF VIEW AND ULTIMATELY BETTER DECISIONS AS WAS NOTED IN THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW A DIVERSE BOARD CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER DECISION MAKING. IMPROVED COMPANY GOVERNANCE AND CAN RESPOND TO MARKET SHIFTS MORE EFFECTIVELY. A RECENT MCKINSEY REPORT FOUND THAT ETHNICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES ARE 35% MORE LIKELY TO OUTPERFORM OTHER COMPANIES THAT LACK A DIVERSE WORK FORCE HAS THE MISSION OF BLOOM ENERGY IS TO MAKE CLEAN RELIABLE ENERGY AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES THAT MISSION IS NOT ONLY INSPIRING IT IS ESSENTIAL WE KNOW WE WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THAT MISSION WITH A DIVERSE BOARD A DIVERSE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND A DIVERSE EMPLOYEE POPULATION THAT BEST SERVES. OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY THE IN WHICH WE BUSINESS. FOR THE THREE WE ARE HONORED TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY NINE. THANK YOU. OUR SECOND ONE IS IN SUPPORT IS BUT JEAN BY WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE VOTE FOR OVER THE PHONE MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE CONNECT US. WITH MISTER GAY. EIGHT YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME CHAIR OF THE MALL YES THANK YOU. HELLO YES I CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU SO MY NAME IS BUCKY AND I'M REPRESENTING HERE APAPA. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLAND PACIFIC FAIR. A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT GROUPS WORKING TO INCREASE APA LEADERSHIP IN THE CIVIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. I'M ALSO HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF NEARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICAN BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS SUPPORTING EIGHTY NINE SEVEN NOT. I COME FROM SILICON VALLEY WHERE WERE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. BEFORE RETIRING AS A VICE PRESIDENT AT CISCO SYSTEMS. SINCE THEN I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME RESEARCHING THE CORPORATE GLASS CEILING FOR MINORITY MEN AND MINORITY WOMEN. MY RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT IN THE LAST DECADE THEY'VE BEEN VERY LITTLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE TO DIVERSIFY THE HIGHER LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST. DESPITE BEST EFFORTS OF THE CORPORATE SECTOR. MY REVIEW OF UC DATING CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT WHITE MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOW ONLY 46% OBSTRUCTION WORKFORCE BUT STILL REPRESENTS P. SO THE DATE IS CLEAR. EXISTING STRATEGIES TO DIVERSIFY HAVE FAILED. THAT'S WHY IT'S TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH TO CELEBRATE LEADERSHIP TO ENGAGE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IT'S PRIVATE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES SEATS IN THE BOARDROOM OR IT'S UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. MEETINGS REPRESENT 67% OF CALIFORNIA POPULATION. BUT HOLD ONLY 14% OF FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND BOARD SEATS IN CALIFORNIA. MY ANALYSIS FOUND THAT EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE WILL DOUBLE THAT NUMBER. IT HAD A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MINORITY BOARD MEMBERS TO FORTY ONE THOUSAND BOARDS. NOW SOME WORRY THAT FINDING QUALIFIED MINORITY RECORDS WOULD BE HARD. BUT I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT CAN'T FIND A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND IT'S ON THE TWENTY THOUSAND MINORITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT SHOULD ONLY BE 28% OF CALIFORNIA FORTY ONE THOUSAND GOLD SEATS. WE DO NOT THINK THAT 22% 20% IS TOO MUCH TO ASK- CORPORATE LEADERS TO BETTER REPRESENT 67% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HOW WE SUPPORT EIGHTY NINE SEVEN NINE. THANK YOU MISTER GATE MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CALLERS IN THE QUEUE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE. HE. ADAM CHAIR. WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE A OTHER TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT GREAT THANK YOUSO MUCH WE WILL MOVE TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES AND- I REMIND THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES THAT THEY HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH OUR FIRST STEP FOR THE FIRST THE FIRST PERSON TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION IS. MODERATOR WILL YOU PLEASE CONNECT US WITH BISHOP WHO WAS TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION OF NINE SEVEN NINE. THIS GOOD AFTERNOON HI THIS IS KATE BISHOP I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE SEVEN NINE. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING CORPORATE AND SECURITIES LAW IN CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS. I PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY CURRENTLY TEACH SECURITIES REGULATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. I AM A COOPER THE LEADING TREATISES ON CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA CORPORATE LAW. AND A PRACTICE. AND THE I AM A PRACTICE CONSULTANT TO THE LEADING TREATISE ON CALIFORNIA SECURITIES LAW. I'M SPEAKING IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AB. NINE SEVEN NINE WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT. AND PERHAPS ON A TEN CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE IT WILL. AGAINST MALE AND NON BY NAY POOR CANDIDATE IN FAVOR OF FEMALE. MINORITY BOARD CANDIDATES WE WILL ALSO PRIVILEGE TRANS GENDER FEMALES OVER OTHER FEMALES. IN MY OPINION AB NINE SEVEN NINE VIOLATE THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES OF THE US AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. THE BILL RELIES ON DIRECTORS SELF IDENTIFICATION AS A MEMBER OF AN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITY WHICH IS DEFINED AS RACE. ETHNICITY AND CERTAIN GENDER RELATED CHARACTERISTICS THIS IS PROBLEMATICAL PRINT NUMBER OF REASONS FOR EXAMPLE CAN. ITSELF IDENTIFICATION BE ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH RECENT CONTROVERSIES INVOLVING CHALLENGES TO INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR NATIVE AMERICAN WITH LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE. THOSE CLAIMS THE RACIAL ETHNIC CATEGORIES ARE ALSO HIGHLY AMBIGUOUS FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE OF ARMENIAN DESCENT. CAN THEY ADD THAT SELF IDENTIFY AS ASIAN COULD FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BENJAMIN CARDOZO. HELP IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC. BECAUSE HE WAS THE SEPHARDIC JEWS. PARMON OF CELL IDENTIFIED ALL REYES A MA'AM ISSUE BECAUSE IT INVOLVES GOVERNMENT COMPELLED SPEECH. IN CONCLUSION I BELIEVE THAT AB NINE SEVEN NINE IS DIVISIVE ARBITRARY AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DON'T HAVE ANY- OTHER SCHEDULED WITNESSES IN UP TO FIND OPPOSITION BUT MODERATE OR DO WE HAVE ANY CALLERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE. MANAGER WE DO APOLOGIZE WE DO HAVE THREE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- IF YOU LIKE WE CAN TRAIN WE CAN START WITH THEM NOW. OR WE CAN START WITH THE OPPOSITION.

EIGHT ONE NINE AUTHORED BY THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND PRESENT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU SOME NUMBERS DOWN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF. SPEAKING FOR OR PRESENTING AND THIS IS A SENATE BILL S. SENATE. BANKING BILL BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS YOUR EFFORTS MADAM CHAIR THAT I GET TO PRESENT HERE AND WE HAVE REALLY BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. AND OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING. FOR CONSUMERS THAT IS TRUE ON. AND WITH THE FOR GOVERNMENT HAVING ST'S BACKED SO MUCH FROM ITS OBLIGATIONS TO CONSUMERS THE STATE'S ARE INDEED HAVING TO STEP IN AND THIS THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH TEARS LEADERSHIP HAS HELD HEARINGS. ON CREATE A HOW WE CREATE IN CALIFORNIA THE BEST PROTECTION FINANCIAL PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT WE CAN'T ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF FEDERAL FAILURES. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS TODAY SO I'M PRESENTING SB EIGHT ONE NINE ON BEHALF SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND IT IS THE PRODUCT OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF WORK AND ACTUALLY SOME THAT GO QUITE BEYOND THAT IT REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SOMEBODY THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR ON THE PROPOSED ENHANCEMENT OF THE STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR. DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET AND SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND THE BANKING COMMITTEES BOTH HOUSES FOR WORKING ON THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I ALSO HAVE BEEN A PART OF AND AM VERY INTERESTED IN. BUT WE CANNOT UNDERSCORE ENOUGH THE ROLE THAT ARE CHAIR HAS PLAYED IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT. AND FROM MY VIEW I'M NOT SURE GOES FAR ENOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT YOU NECESSARILY CREATES THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE HOPED AND I KNOW THAT THE WHAT THE CHAIR HAD SET UP BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO TAKE A BOLD STEP IN A STEP THAT IS BEFORE US AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IT IS A COLLECTION OF A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING REALLY TRULY SUBSTANTIAL. SO THE CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATION BACK IN JANUARY INTRODUCED A PROPOSED BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE AND IT'S GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE ITERATIONS. AND FORTUNATELY IT'S GONE THROUGH THOSE ITERATIONS. UNDER THAT THE GUIDANCE OF THIS COMMITTEE BOTH ITS CHIEF CONSULTANTS AND CERTAINLY IT'S CHAIR WHO PLAYED A VERY STRONG ROLE IN THIS. AND WHAT THIS REALLY DOES NOW. IS GIVE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT SOME REAL TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. THE LACK OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. FINANCIAL PROTECTION THERE ARE FORTY. IS THEY DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE OF SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND THEN RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD PUT SOME SUNSET REVIEW ON THE VIOS AFFORDING. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED AND INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS THROUGH OUR OVERSIGHT PROCESS AND I'M HOPING THAT AS WE LEARN AND AS WE SEE WHAT DVO DOES THAT WILL BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THAT TRUST SO THAT WE CAN DO OVERSIGHT. BUT WE ALSO ARE NOT GOING TO BE INTERFERING WITH THE SOLID ABILITY OF AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY TO DO THE KINDS OF ENFORCEMENT THAT WE WOULD EXPECT. SO WE NEED TO THEN THIS THIS ALSO BILL ALSO CONTEMPLATES THAT SOME OF. THE STEPS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN OR GOING TO NEED TO BE FUNDED. AND OVER THAN THE YEARS THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING RESOURCES TO DVO AND WE WILL BE DOING THAT. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND THIS BILL CONTAINS ENHANCED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF DVO INCLUDING ANNUAL HEARINGS IN WHICH THE COMMISSIONER WILL TESTIFY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. HE'LL HAVE TO COME TO US AND EXPLAIN WHAT HOW THIS IS WORKING AND ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS THESE OVERSIGHTS ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NOW HAVE BEEN BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS IN HAVE BEEN BUILT IN. BASED ON A LOT OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THE PRIMARY. FOCUS OF WHAT THIS BILL LISTEN THAT IS THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BEFORE US TO BUILD THE STRONG ENOUGH STRUCTURE THE BEST STRUCTURE THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT AVENUE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS AS WE KNOW THROUGH HEARINGS HERE. THEY THE PREVIOUS CFPB WHICH IS NOW MOSTLY CREDITED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WAS PART OF TWO PRONG APPROACH IS THE TWIN PEAKS THEY CALL IT IN ONE. IS HAVE AN INDUSTRY FACING ORGANIZATION WHICH DPO DOES AT THIS POINT THE OTHER WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT IS THE CONSUMER FACING. P. THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT KINDS OF TOOLS TO GIVE CONSUMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE FACED IN THE FINANCIAL. ARENA IT'S NO IT'S THIS IS NOT. NECESSARILY THE SILVER BULLET. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST WE CAN BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT START DOWN THAT PATH AND WITH WHAT'S BEEN BUILT IN THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE HAVE IN THE REPORTING BACK TO LEGISLATURE IN THE PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT INTO THIS BILL. WE DO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE INTERACTIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING TO THE STANDARDS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WANTS TO STEP FORWARD. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS SUSAN SUZANNE MARTINDALE FROM CONSUMER REPORTS. AND I KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT INFORMATIVE FINANCE OR AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND WITHOUT MEMBERS. I ASK FOR YOUR ITEMS.

BLINDED ENSURE EQUAL TREATMENT AND A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE INTO THE NEED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AS EVIDENCED BY 40% INCREASE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- STRONG THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO OUR ATTENTION- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS DEALING WITH US IN THE COMMENTS- PROBABLY OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RATIONAL BEHIND EXEMPTING. SOME OF THE LICENSEES BUT NOT THE ENTIRE- UNIVERSES OF B. AND- WELL MUCH MUCH OF THIS LANGUAGE HAS BEEN MODELED AFTER DODD FRANK BUT I THINK THE REGULATOR PART BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND IF WE IF THIS PASSES SO DID DID YOU AGENCY WANTS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGULATE THE PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE ISSUES AND I KNOW WE HAVE FOLKS FROM DVO ON THE LINE A LOT OF THE THOSE PROVISIONS WERE DONE BASED ON WHAT DVO HAS IDENTIFIED THEY FEEL THEIR NEEDS ARE. SO IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS A COMMENT ON HOW YOU CREATED THAT STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. IT'S CRUCIAL TO THE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS EVER SAY CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. HI CHRIS HOGAN THE CHIEF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT A MAJORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT EXISTING LIKING PETE ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER I HANDLE BREAKING P. THAT HAVE LICENSURE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT AS ROBUST AS THE OTHER INVOLVED. ARE INCLUDED YEAH THAT THEIR INCLUSION THAT. WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO USE STATE AUTHORIZED AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE AGAINST UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AND TO UTILIZE THAT THE CLEARLY DRAWN REMEDY WITHIN THE STATE LAW. ESSENTIALLY THIS WOULD GIVE THE DPO MORE ROBUST IMPORTS THE GRAVITY. FIFTEEN PLASTIC STRUCTURES LACK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MEASURE OUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ON. THE ISSUE OF THE NEW CAR DEALERS AND- WHAT IS IT MEANT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE MOSTLY EXEMPT. WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN. PERHAPS WE CAN AND DVO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE SINCE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN USING THAT TERMINOLOGY. OKAY THANK YOU. GREAT AGAIN THIS IS CRUCIAL TO THE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE EIGHT- CAN GET GOES INTO THE- DETAIL IN THIS WEEK- I COULD GET OF THE DEPARTMENT AND I'LL- WELL THE NEW CARD. LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN. TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NEW CAR DEALERS BUT- THE BILL PROVIDES THAT LAKE CITY THEM OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT EXEMPT AS LONG AS THEY'RE ACTING WITHINTHEIR LIKELY. WITH ANOTHER STATE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS OKAY WE THINK THAT NEW CAR DEALERS ARE ALREADYARE COVERED THEIR THAT THEIR LIFE BY THE DMV- AND SO WE CONTINUE TO I'M NOT NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST SUPPORT AMENDMENT- AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS GOES INTO IT AS WELL THANKS. THANK MEMBERS ANY DISH QUESTION ARE COMMON. CNN THANK YOU SAMBHAR STONE FOR PRESENTING THIS- AND I DO WANT THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT AND IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST A YEAR BUT REALLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN TRYING TO FIND THE FINAL PROPOSAL A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AT OUR LAST HEARING WERE INCLUDED IN THIS. IN ADDITION TO THE OVERSIGHT- AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD A VOICE- THERE IS A SENSE OF FOR YOUR SUNSET THEY'RE BOTH ON THE BUDGET AND- A FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AS WELL- I THINK THAT TO AND THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT WHERE WE STARTED AS- WE CAN PRETTY MUCH STAY FROM. EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT'S BEING VOTED ON AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH THIS COMMITTEE HAS ENGAGED IN THIS ISSUE THE FEEDBACK THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN. TO ME TO THE BANKING COMMITTEE TO D. B. L. YOU KNOW TO THE SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION IN THE END I THINK HAVING A ROLE A MORE ROBUST- DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT THAT WILL NOW BE D. P. I. F. T. F. PA ONE OF THOSE I CAN'T YEAH- HE IS GOING TO BE THE RIGHT THING FOR CONSUMERS AND FOR CONSUMERS IN ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE. AND I THINK WE ARE SEEING THAT AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S EXEMPTS- WHAT'S NOT IN THE END CONSUMERS HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND IT IS OUR HOPE RIGHT THAT WE WON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE GO AND SEEK OUT ASSISTANCE FOR WRONGDOING- AND SO I THINK THAT- IN THE ABSENCE OF. AND THAT WE DO WANT TO HAVE A CONSUMER AGENCY THAT CAN BE HELPFUL IN PROVIDING INFORMATION- AND ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP TO ALL CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- PARTICULARLY ON FINANCIAL SERVICES SO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING- I DO ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SB EIGHT NINETEEN.
