OKAY NOW LET'S JUST RIGHTS WITH ONE THE EDGE THIS IS THAT'S TWENTY SO THIS IS ARE ARE COLLEAGUES AND SKINNER. BOB ON CARBON SEEK. AND YOU MAY YOU REST WHEN READY. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO PRESENT SB THIRTY TWENTY SO TWO SO I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE IN OUR CLIMATE CRISIS THAT IT IS- WE'RE THE CRISIS IS VERY. NOT ONLY SERIOUS THAT'S THE TERM CRISIS BUT THAT WE HAVE A VERY BRIEF WINDOW. TO ACT TO ADDRESS THE WORST CONSEQUENCES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN OTHER WORDS A BRIEF WINDOW. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN SO THAT THOSE ABSOLUTE WORST CONSEQUENCES ARE AVOIDED. AND THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON CUTTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WE HAVE BEEN A LEADER NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT A WORLDWIDE. AND WE'RE DOING WELL THERE BUT IS NOT ENOUGH WE MUST ALSO CONTAIN AS MUCH CARBON AS POSSIBLE FROM REACHING THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THAT IS WHAT SEQUESTRATION IS IT IS THE CONTAINMENT OF CARBON SO WE UNDERSTAND IT WELL IN RELATIONSHIP TO WATER PLANTS DO AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND BETTER THAT OUR SOILS HAVE A ROLE IN THIS. AND THAT OUR OCEANS BECAUSE OF THE PLANKTON AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS HAVE A STRONG ROLE THAT THERE'S LOTS OF RULES FOR. NATURE'S ABILITY TO CONTAIN CARBON AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. STRENGTHEN OUR STATE'S RULES AROUND ALLOWING ENTITIES TO UTILIZE THAT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS WITHIN WETLANDS FORESTS HEALTHY SOILS OR WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONTAIN THAT CARBON. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE LEAST COST WAYS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE HAVE A ONCE IN A. GENERATION CHANCE TO FUNNEL PRIVATE MONEY INTO FINDING GOOD CALIFORNIA CARBON CONTAINMENT PROJECTS. THERE ARE FIFTY THREE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOW SIGNED ON TO THE AMAZON PLEDGE TO GO CARBON NEUTRAL BY TWENTY FORTY. THOSE COMPANIES INCLUDING UNILEVER MICROSOFT IBM COCA COLA VERIZON. SO WHAT SB TWENTY SEVEN SPECIFICALLY DOES IS IT SUPPORTS OUR FARMERS AND LAND MANAGERS. WHO ALREADY ARE IN ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE USING GOOD PRACTICES CONTAINING CARBON FROM REALLY BEING RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND IT HELPS MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE IMPACTS BY DIRECTING THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO SET GOALS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION FOR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. DIRECTS OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO INCLUDE CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN THE UPCOMING SCOPING PLAN AND ESTABLISHES A REGISTRY OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS APPLE PR FOR POTENTIAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FIRM REQUIRES OR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO TRACK THE CARBON BENEFITS OF THESE PROJECTS.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS MIA LOWER GOING FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE YOU CAN PUT IN A LETTER CONCERNS LAST WEEK AND THE ALONG WITH OUR HEROES. THANK YOU CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE ACCORDING. TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH YOU- MAINTENANCE AND OF. THANK. Y. NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING AT YOUR TURN NUMBERS TO LOWER SHE WITH THE HELP FARM AND AS OUR CALL MISSION WORKING IN- IF THE MIDDLE OF CONCERN FOR THE- OUR CONCERN PUT ON THAT RELATED TO THAT BUT TO TRYING THAT OPENING FOR IN THE BILL WITH THE- KERR UNDER WAY AT THE RIVER STADIUM. WE ALSO THE UNDER THANK PROCESS AND IN THE STILL BE GOAL SETTING BE WERE BECAUSE WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IT SENATORS CAN NOTED LAND AND FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE REALLY AT THE TO THE- THANK YOU. OKAY MORE FOR SO MUCH- LET'S NOW WITH. BRING THE MATTER BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THOUGHTS ON SENATE ALL. YOUR BERNIE. JUST A QUESTION AS A MAN THE YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP IN THE PROBE SO FAR IT FOR LIKE THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED BY THE FARM BUREAU FOR. FOR THOSE WHO IS MANDATORY OR IS IT OPTIONAL. THIS WOULD. BE ENTITIES WORK WHO WANTED TO UTILIZE IT IT'S OPTIONAL NOW. THE SORRY NOW WHAT THIS BILL IS PRIMARILY TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A COT CREATE A PROCESS FOR. THOSE LAND MANAGERS THOSE AGGIE- ENTITIES AND ALL WHO ARE WANT TO PRACTICE. ONE ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICES THAT MOST CONTAIN CARBON WOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PROTOCOL DEVELOPED AND POTENTIALLY THEN HAVE THEIR ACTIONS. ABLE TO BE UTILIZED WITHIN THE- NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE WE DON'T NOW COUNTED EVEN IN THE IN OUR- EMISSIONS INVENTORY BUT RATHER IN PRIVATE SECTOR PROJECTS NOW THAT ARE TRYING TO INVEST IN CARBON SYSTEM SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS WHICH RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR BECAUSE WE HAVE NO PROTOCOL FOR THAT. SO JUST A FOLLOW UP TO AS MANY NO I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR. INFORCE FIRES TO BE COUNTED IN OUR CARBON OUTPUT WHICH WE DON'T RIGHT NOW RIGHT- AND THEN THE OTHER I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO AS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S IN OUR CULTURE. WHO THERE'S CERTAIN PRACTICES I HAVE TO DO ON MY FARM THAT ARE THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION- BY TILLAGE. THERE'S ALSO ABILITIES TO USE- TO PUT CARBON INTO THE GROUND THROUGH BIO CHAR AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER GREAT RESOURCES OUT THERE BUT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAJOR THAT AND TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU FIT IN THE PROCESS OF- MAYBE THEY'RE GETTING A CREDIT OR OR BEING PENALIZED. AND SO I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T PUT THE ONUS ON. THE PERSONS I KNOW THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY CRITICAL AND HOW HOW WE IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU GET TO THE GROUND. AND THAT'S WHY IT IS NOT MANDATORY RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE WELCOME. OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY CASKEY. MISTER CAN YOU EXPLAIN ARE CLARIFIED THUNDERSTORMS HIGHLIGHT D. D. POTENTIAL OR THE PROTECTION THAT YOU HAVE FOR OFFSETS THAT STATEMENT AND PRIVATE ENTITY OR PUBLIC ENTITY MAY WANT TO TRY TO USE THIS REGISTRY AS FAR AS TO NOT FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION A STATUTORY OBLIGATION OR WHATEVER TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. SO THE- THIS BILL COVERS THESE- FOR EXAMPLE WETLANDS SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY AND SUCH LIKE THAT AND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE EMISSIONS FROM THOSE SECTORS ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN OUR EMISSIONS INVENTORY. THEY COULD NOT FIVE. THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR AN OFFSET PURPOSE SO THIS BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY ESTABLISH A CONTEXT WHERE THEY WOULD WITHIN OUR FRAMEWORK USED FOR AN OFFSET BUT IT WOULD ALLOW THEM FOR TO PARTICIPATE IN SAY EXAMPLE PRIVATE SECTOR- HE- INVESTMENTS FOR. CAPTURING CARBON IF THAT PRIVATE SECTOR CAN FEEL ASSURED THAT THE THAT THE PRACTICE THAT WHICHEVER ENTITIES ENGAGED IN IT ACTUALLY CAPTURES ARE CONTAINS CARBON PAPER I MEAN I THINK IT YOUR BILL GOES DOES MORE THAN THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT ALLOW. IT THAT THE CREATION OF A CREDIT FOR- FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OF THE MARKET BASS THING EXACTLY YES- AND THEN JUST SO. MY COLLEAGUE WHO SITS ON SEPT TWO OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING DISCUSSION IN BUDGET TALKS WITH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WERE WE SPECIFICALLY PUT MORE MONEY IN FOR WORKING LANDS WHICH GIVEN THE REGISTRY THAT YOU SET UP IN THE COOPERATION WITH THE AGENCIES WILL PROVIDE MORE. INVESTMENTS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN CUT. LATER DOES A- SENATE. IDEAS HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN TO ZERO SO WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE. MORE INTEREST THIS YEAR I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK HOW MOVE THE BILL- AT THIS TIME BUT JUST TO THE EMAIL THAT THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE ASSEMBLY THAT THEY THEY REMOVE MONEY FROM HERE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THIS IS A- A COUPLING OF A- OF- CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THE MARKET OF WHAT'S GONNA GO ON. BY THE WAY SINCE GARY I HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT- KELLY CALLINGIS NOW AVAILABLE BUT YOUR OF YOUR EVEN MOVED AND YOU'RE GETTING YOUR DOING GREAT BUT EVERYBODY OBVIOUSLY SHE'S AVAILABLE IF YOU IF YOU WANT- CENTER BATES. A YES VOTE THANK YOUS ARE SENATOR SKINNER FOR UPBRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT HAS A REAL NOBLE GOAL. HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE UNDEFINED ILL DEFINED. IN WHEN IT GOES TO- THEY ARE BE ON YOUR- GOALS ARE SETTING AND- THERE ARE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE COMEDIAN ELEPHAS PATTERN. I WONDER IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS ON PAGE SIX OF EIGHT. IT SPEAKS ABOUT THE AUTHOR ME WE SHOULD CONSIDER ALLOWING- PRD DEFINED PROJECTS. IN THERE'S ONE OTHER THAN JUST HARD FOR US. THOSE PAGE. IT SAYS. SINCE PARAGRAPH IS THREE TO THE RED TO. FOR PRIOR. THAT DO YOU TYPE OF WORK BUT THE AUTHOR ME WE SHOULD COME CLARA THE- YOU NEED TO GET ALONE ARE ALSO RESULT. AND I'M SICK HOME PAGE. SIX DEBATERS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE. REGARDING DEFINING. SO IT I CAN CLOSER THE AREAS THAT ARE A LITTLE TROUBLE FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I I'D LIKE THE GOAL THAT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER DEFINED CHEN IN A COUPLE AREAS. IF I MAY ADDRESS THAT MR DISAGREES. SURE I THINK THIS IS. A TWO POINT CENTER BATES I THINK THIS THE FACT THAT IT IS THE BILL AS WRITTEN IN THE WAY THAT IT IS SHOULD GIVE YOU COMFORT VERSUS CONCERN. BECAUSE IN I COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT SUCH THAT I WAS NOT ONLY CREATING THE REGISTRY BUT REQUIRING A RB TWO COUNTIES EMISSIONS AND THEN THUS REQUIRING. A WHOLE PROTOCOL FOR THAT WOULD BE A FORCE FOR EXAMPLE AS SENATOR DOLLY POINTED OUT. VARIOUS OF THE HTC'S CONCERNED IN TAPPED TO PARTICIPATE AND US- THEY COULD THEN BE ELIGIBLE OBVIOUSLY FOR. THE STATE OFFICIAL OFFSETS BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I'VE DONE IN EFFECT YOU CAN VIEW THIS AS KIND OF BABY STEPS. WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO HERE IS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS. PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT THAT WANTS TO INVEST IN PROJECTS THAT HELP TO. SEQUESTER IS THE SCIENTIFIC WORD I USE CONTAINMENT TO CONTAIN CARBON TO KEEP IT FROM GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND WE ARE HALF PUT OUR- WE HAVE PUT ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA AT A DISADVANTAGE BY NOT HAVING THIS IN A REGISTRY AND NOT HAVING A PROTOCOL. SO I'M TRYING TO CREATE THAT SITUATION WHERE. IF THERE IS AN ENTITY WHO IS INTERESTED IN THIS AND THEY MAY NEED SOME- FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THAT THIS IS A WAY THEY COULD GET PRIVATE SECTOR CAPITAL. TO TO ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW CONTAIN CARBON. SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN SHOULD GIVE YOU- NOT TOO CONCERNED. VERSUS HAD A WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THANK YOU I THINK TO THEM JUST TO HOLD OFF AGAIN I'M- A MONTH DOES IT GOES FORWARD TO SEE ARE. THE CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE MADE THANK YOU. OKAY ARE. ZERO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- FROM THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CASKEY IT'S A DO PASS- BUT IT IT FIRST WILL BE REFERRED TO THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND WATER. SO SO THERE WILL BE A SECOND CRACK IT AT THE BILL THERE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE MEMBERS THERE- BUT WITH THAT- LOVE TO. HAVE YOU CLOSE I THINK WE'VE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION AND I THINK- GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRISIS IN THE NECESSITY TO ACT QUICKLY SOME COULD ARGUE WHY DO NIGHT WHY HAVE I WRITTEN A BILL. THAT IS IN EFFECT SO VOLUNTARY AND IS IN EFFECT BABY STEPS WHEN WE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE BABY STEPS RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE DONE SO THAT WE CAN GET COMFORT IN THIS AREA AND THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY. INTO IT. AS A REAL AS A REALLY. SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION TOWARDS THIS IS A CRISIS OF CARBON BEING RELEASED INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT AYE ASTRI AYE VOTE PRESIDENT. THE WORK IN THE SERVICE CENTER. OKAY CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NUMBER ONE SB TWENTY CENTER ID TWENTY SEVEN BY CENTER SKINNER THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES ALLEN. HI ALAN HI BATES NOT LOADING. EIGHT NOT VOTING DALLY. DALY NOT VOTING CONSERVE I GONZALEZ SKINNER BY INNER ISTER. BY COUNTY BY HOUSEKI I. THANKS FOR THANK YOU OKAY WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR CENTERS STERN THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER- NOT MEMBERS- AYE AYE YOU IS TYPICALLY CUSTOMERS FOR THE CHAIR TO GO LAST- BUT BECAUSE OF THE PHONE LINES ACTUATION- WELL WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STICK TO FILE OR SO I DO APOLOGIZE THAT MEANS I MEAN BE PRESENT A NEXT I'M GOING TO PASSED THE GAVEL TO OUR- ESTEEMED VICE CHAIR. I ALSO TO SAY THAT- AS I THAT THERE WE ALSO BEEN ASKED THIS TO PRESENT AT OUR AT OUR- DESKS SO AS TO NOT BE MOVING AROUND AS MUCH SOMEONE CENTER CASKEY PRESENTS HIS BILL. HE WILL. AT PRESENT THERE WE GO TO REAL WITH IT. WHEN THEY HAVE. IT A HOW YOU. THERE'S NOBODY THERE HE SAID. SO SENATOR ALAN WE'RE GOING FILE ORDER DOES THAT MEAN WE TAKE SB FORTY FOUR FIRST THAT'S CORRECT OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE 2% THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO THIS BILL IS A BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE SEE BEFORE AND THAT TIME EVERYBODY IS VOTED ON BEFORE AT THAT THE IDEA THEY WOULD ESTABLISH EXPEDITED SEEK REVIEW FOR GREEN TRANSIT PROJECTS AND REQUIRES THE COURTS RESOLVE RELATED. SECRET LAWSUITS WITHIN TWO TO SEVENTY DAYS- THE IDEA BEING THE SOONER THAT TRANSFORMATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. HI TRANSIT PROJECTS CAN COMPLETE THE SEQUEL PROCESSES AND MAY BE BUILT THE FASTER THEY WILL BEND DISPLACE LESS EFFICIENT AND POLLUTION INTENSIVE. REGIONAL TRIPS TAKEN BY PASSENGERS IN PRIVATE VEHICLES. SO IN ORDER TO GET EXPEDITED REVIEW UNDER THIS BILL THE PROJECTS HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE REGION SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY TRANSPORTATION PLAN. WE HAVE TO OPERATE OF ZERO EMISSIONS THEY HAVE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITHOUT USING OFFSETS IN AFTER REDUCE OVERALL VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THE CORRIDOR. WHERE THE PROJECT OPERATES. AT THE BILL'S IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO SB SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A BILL THAT PASSED THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR- YOU MAY RECALL THAT IT WAS IT WAS TIED. WITH SOME LANGUAGE TO THE PRO TEMS SB NINE NINETY FIVE. HI AND SO. FORTH IN A BECAUSE THAT BILL FAILED WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO PASS THAT WE ARE BILL FAILED- SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY AB COMING BACK AGAIN WITH THIS TIME IS NOT TIED TO ANOTHER BILL'S LANGUAGE SO THAT THAT THAT PROBLEM IS RESOLVED.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. THE WELL THANK YOU A LINE OF SIXTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BATES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RICHARD MARCUSSEN FOR THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. WE DON'T OPPOSE THE ENVIRONMENT LEADERSHIP TRANSIT PROJECTS HOWEVER THERE IS A TROUBLING PROVISION IN THE MEASURE THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL PENALTIES IMPOSSIBLE DEPARTMENT FOR CONTRACTORS WHO EITHER FAILED TO REPORT OR USE THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IN THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS. BUT LANGUAGE IN THE MEASURE. GIVE CERTAIN CONTRACTORS UNDER PRESSURE KLEBER AGREEMENT A PASS OUT FROM THESE PENALTIES AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE OPPOSED TO IT UNLESS THE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE MANDATE. IS APPLIED ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH AT THIS TIME MADAM CHAIR THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH ME WHEN I. FINISH MY COFFEE I'M- I'M ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS AND I HEARD SPUR AND SOME OF THE U. S. SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION INDICATE THAT THERE'S A BIG SEQUEL PROBLEM A BIG SEQUEL. LIT LITIGATION PROBLEM AND WHICH IS BRING EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION TO THE FACTS THAT OVER FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN TWENTY NINE CHALLENGES SOME OF THOSE DUPLICATIVE AND THAT THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THE EXPEDITED. REVIEW WOULD BE VERY LOW SO WHAT I UNDERSTAND PROPONENTS WANT TO BARK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO STREAMLINE THIS IS THIS IS A LITTLE INCIDENT OF RACES. OF PROJECTS THAT WE COME TO THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION IT WOULD ACTUALLY GO THROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW WITH THAT SAID. I WOULD ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I MEAN. I'M I AM DISHEARTENED THAT SB SEVEN AND THIS BILL HAS TAKEN OUT THE CLARIFICATION. ABOUT THAT EXIST IN THE COURTS WHETHER IT'S A BUSINESS STATE OR SCORE AT CALENDAR DAY IN AND WE'RE HERE'S THE LEGISLATURE JUST A PRIMARY THING THAT WE DO IN THE LEGISLATURE IS WHEN WE HAVE TWO STREAMS OF COURT DECISIONS. WE MAKE IT THIS A STATUTE THAT CLARIFIES IT WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS DAYS REPORT DAIS IT CAN BE IN OTHERS ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THEM. BUT WHEN THE COURTS HAVE THIS AMBIGUITY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS PICKING AND CHOOSING ON WHAT SHOULD BE CALCULATED DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO DELAY OR THEY WANT TO SPEED UP. IN ONE OF THE RULES HERE'S LEGISLATURE AND I'D I'D MENTION THIS IN SB SEVEN DAYS THAT WE PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION- WITH SO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OUR COURTS. WHO WERE GOING TO GET INUNDATED WITH CASES FOLLOWING THE PANDEMIC OF ALL KINDS IN FAMILY COURTS. AND NOW THEY'RE FAST TRACKING. TRANSIT PROJECTS AS WELL AS A HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WE AT LEAST HELP THEM OUT ON HOW TO COUNT THE DAYS SO I WOULD URGE THE AUTHOR- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO DO WITH IT BUT I WOULD URGE THAT THAT. FIFTY VERY. IMPORTANT REC TION THAT THE COURTS. WOULD AYE AYE A PUTTING BRACE SO. MAN CHAIR THAT'S MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU. SENATOR ALI THANK YOU- A SO I SAID I'M A SUPPORTER BILL NO PROBLEM I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CLARIFY MAYBE THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT THE ANY UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR THE FOR THE CONTRACTORS- I THINK THAT THAT'S A CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. YEAH WE SO BOTH CASES ACTUALLY AND ONCE AGAIN WE ARE. WE ARE WORKING. WITH THE PRO TEM'S BILL AS THE- SORT OF MODEL THAT WE'RE WORKING ON FOR THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN THIS YEAR AND SO I THINK THAT- WE NEED TO GET. WE NEED TO GET BOTH ISSUES. WORKED ON WITH WITH WITH THE PRETEND FOLKS AND- BUT I I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE TO THE CALLER'S CONCERNS AND SO LET ME LET ME CIRCLE BACK WITH. WITH THAT SIMPLE TO THE PROFOUND OFFICE AND OUR STAFF AND WILL CIRCLE BACK WITH BOTH OF YOUR OFFICES ABOUT BOTH THIS THIS THIS ISSUE OF THE COUNTY DAYS I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE THE SENATE WITH CASKEY- AND- AND I ALSO AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ASSOCIATED- SO. PRIVATE YEAH I THINK THIS IS PART OF A BROADER. WAY ON EXPEDITED REVIEW AND WE'RE TRYING TO. KEEP THE LANGUAGE AND CONSISTENT BUT- BUT IT DOES LEAD TO SOME COCKINESS AND- AS A WILL BE TIED TO THEIR OFFICE ABOUT HOW THAT THAT NON NEGOTIATIONS PROCEEDING. AND WHEN WELCOME YOUR INPUT SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- I'M ON MY EIGHT EIGHT NINETY YEAR HERE AT THIS AND I VOTED FOR EVERY SINGLE. SEQUEL EXEMPTION TO. EXPEDITE THE PROJECT. AND I THINK THERE'S IT SHOULD BE NOTED NOT EXEMPTION OF COURSE NOT WELL BUT WE'RE STILL MAKING IT SO WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE AYE I WOULD PUT IT IN THAT CATEGORY- TRYING TO HELP GET A PROJECT WITH IT WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THIS IF WE WERE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE. SO I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S THAT WE NEED TO CIRCLE BACK AT SOME POINT AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE IT WITH. THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER. FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THINGS DONE. AND IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE- CONTINUALLY SEE. A LOT OF THIS MEAN WE JUST DID LAST WEEK FOR. FOR THE PRO TEM. A SEQUEL EXEMPTION. OR EXCEED COULD STREAMLINE LISTA SE STREAMLINING SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL US. I GUESS THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT DOES THIS TELL US THAT TELLS US THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND WE PICK AND CHOOSE. WE PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ONES WE WANT TO. HELP STREAMLINE OR THE ONES WE DON'T BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OUT THERE THAT DON'T GET THAT SPECIAL EXEMPTION OR EXPRESSIONIST REMINDING. THAT LEGISLATION SO I JUST WANT TO BRING IT TO KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE THIS MANY TYPES OF STREAMLINING WE ARE STREAMLINED SOMETHING AND MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. NOT JUST THE SELECT FEW SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD. AGAIN BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME I TRY TO DO. SOME STREAMLINING. PROCESSES WHEN I FIRST CAME IN YOU KNOW I DIDN'T GET ON THE GATE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN ON ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. WHETHER TO ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE. WHETHER IT'S A CONSTRUCTION SITE. WHETHER IT'S- BUSINESSES COMPETING AGAINST BUSINESSES THAT DON'T THERE'S A LOT. OF INTEREST I SHOULD SAY MAYBE THAT'S A GREAT WORD FOR IN THIS AREA SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO LIFE BECAUSE WE DO THIS A LOT. AND THAT OUGHT TO GIVE US INDICATION THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING OVERALL THAT MAKES IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU YES SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. EIGHT- ONE THING I WILL SAY CENTER TASK IS RIGHT. AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF CASES IN IN IN THE IN THE- YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THIS BILL- THE DID THE OTHER THING I SUPPOSE THIS IS THAT. YOU KNOW HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT. PUBLIC TRANSIT. PROJECTS THAT HAVE TO MEET HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. IT'S SUCH AN UNEQUIVOCAL. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. AND DONE SO I THINK THE IDEA WAS THAT. WITH WITH PROJECTS THAT HAVE SUCH A- FACIALLY- FIVE OF. VISUAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND ESPECIALLY WITH TH STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET THAT THAT. THAT MERITS THIS THIS APPROACH ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT VERY MANY.

MADAMS VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PFIZER BURKE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE PASSED SB ONE FIFTY WHICH IS THE PRO TEM'S BILL YOU MAY RECALL. AND THE CARD IN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION RESULTING FROM WENDY'S PLANNING DECISIONS AND ISSUE A REPORT AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND- THE FINDINGS OF THAT REPORT WERE CLEAR KERR NOTED THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. EXPECTED UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH WAS SOME CENTER CYBER EXPELLED FROM FOR QUITE SOMETIME AGO. AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE'S TOTAL EMISSIONS. MAN BECAUSE THE MISSIONS AND WHILE EMISSIONS FROM OTHER SECTORS HAVE DECLINED THE TREND LINE FOR TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS CONTINUES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION DESPITE INCREASES IN FUEL EFFICIENCY AND DECREASES IN THE CARBON CONTENT OF FUEL. YET ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN. DROVE ONE POINT FIVE MILES LESS EACH DAY BY TWENTY THIRTY OUR STATE WOULD REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS AND MEET CLIMATE GOALS FOR THIS BILL IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT REPORT IN AN EFFORT TO GET. OUR STATE BACK ON TRACK AND BETTER ALIGN LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING WITH THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE GOALS IT REQUIRES. THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE TASKED WITH CREATING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. DESIGNED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS WITHIN THEIR REGIONS. AND ALSO AND REQUIRES THAT THE NPOS IDENTIFY STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED NOW IDENTIFY NICKEL DIFFICULT MILES TRAVELED. REDUCTIONS IN PLANNING STRATEGIES WILL ENSURE THAT LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ARE BETTER ALIGNED TO ADDRESS RISING EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND ALSO HOPEFULLY YOU HAD TO HANDLE SOME OF OUR CONGESTION CHALLENGES AND IN THE END CITIES LIKE MINE. WHAT TWO SIXTY ONE CREATES A PROCESS FOR INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE NPOS AND CARB THE REQUIRES THAT THE MPO SUBMIT THEIR DROPS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY TO CAR. AND THE CAR PROVIDE WRITTEN FEEDBACK WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS NPOS WILL BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW FEEDBACK IS INCORPORATED INTO. THEIR FINAL SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES LIKE CITIES AND COUNTIES REPORT TO NPOS THE EXISTING AND PLANNED INFRSTRUCTURE THE DENTISTS HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THEIR STABLE COMMITTEE STRATEGIES. MEDIA THE FIGHT BY INCREASING. COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE NPOS IN CARBON THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN SUSTAINABLE COMMITTEE STRATEGIES AND BRING US CLOSER TO. MEETING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS SO HERE INTEST TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WE'VE GOT A CARD A RIBBON ON BEHALF A NATURIST DEFENSE COUNSEL. AND ALSO WILLIAM BARRETT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. PLEASE THE BOARD. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE OUR SUPPORTERS ONLINE. YES I'M SURE THE LINES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU MORNING THIS IS CARTER WRITTEN IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS ENTITIES TO PORT FOR SB TWO SIXTY ONE WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO HALT CLIMATE CHANGE EXTEND TO OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. THE TERM MENTIONED THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND POOR AIR QUALITY. AND DESPITE INCREASINGLY FRIEDMAN. DISASTERS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT POURS MORE FUEL ON THAT FIRE. OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES EMBRACE THE ALARM THAT OUR CURRENT TRANSPORTATION POLICIES ARE PUSHING MORE ROADS AND WIDER ROADS YOU KNOW GENERATE MORE DRIVING. SO S. B. TWO SIXTY ONE BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE ENSURE ALLEN'S BILL SB ONE FIFTY. RECOGNIZING THAT FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS GIVING CALIFORNIANS. SOMETHING THEY CONSISTENTLY ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO GET AROUND WITHOUT GETTING IN THEIR CARS. AND THANKS TO SB ONE FIFTY WHICH REALLY SETS THE TABLE FOR THIS BILL WE KNOW THAT. THE PORTION OF COMMUTERS DRIVE ALONE TO WORK. IT WAS RISING PARTS THE PANDEMIC. VEHICLE MISSIONS ARE CLIMBING DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP THE VEHICLE FLEET. AND IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA STANDS TO SPEND. OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF CURRENT TRANSPORTATION PLANS BUT THAT THESE PLANS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SO SB TWO SIXTY ONE SO TAKE THE SHIFT- TO ALIGN OUR INVESTMENTS WITH A CHRONICLES BY INTEGRATING VMT INTO THE PLANNING FRAMEWORK SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. MAKE SURE REGIONAL PLANNER HELPING REDUCE DRIVING IMPROVING ALTERNATIVE STRIVING. YEAH THIS BILL CREATES A BETTER STRUCTURE FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO REVIEW THE REGION STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING. THE EMPTY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND IS PROPELLED DRINK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TABLE TO WORK WITH REGION TO HARMONIZE THEIR LOCAL LAND USE PLAN TO TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT. IS REGIONAL PLAN THANK YOU SHALLENBERGER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO. HI THANK YOU. THANK YOU LIVES GO TO OUR ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE. DO WE HAVE ANYONE WISHING TO. TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND FORTY TWO OR- KATHY THE CW. TWENTY FIVE THE BLUES WILL BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO SPEAKING- YOUR CURRENT SUPPORTERS SB TWO SIXTY ONE- WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING ON THE LEGISLATION BUT FOR TODAY WE'RE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR LEADING SOURCE OF CALIFORNIANS ON CLIMATE MOTION. WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HEALTHIER MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVES ALL RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA WILL NOT MEET OUR CLEANER INCLEMENT STANDARDS. LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING IS CENTRAL TO THIS DISCUSSION WE ARE NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE HEALTHEQUITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS OR CENTRAL. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. U. S. B. TO SIXTY OF THEM OP. TO IMPROVE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. AND SECURE BUT- SECURE BENEFITS OF HELP YOUR COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OFTEN DEALING WITH CHRONIC HEALTH BURDENS. DUE TO LACK OF HEALTHY TRANSPORTATION OP AND OPTIONS AND HIGH LEVELS OF TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION. AS ENVISIONED IN SB TWO SIXTY ONE UPDATING THE TARGET TIME FRAMES BROADENING THE FOCUS TO INCLUDE THE EMPTY REDUCTION TARGETS. IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS ARE ALL IMPORTANT STEPS IN PURSUIT OF HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW SB TWO SIXTY ONE INVESTING SURE BUT THE PROMISE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS REALIZED FOR EVERY COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO BMG REDUCTIONS TO THE HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT OR OTHER CHALLENGES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHETHER SCS ACTIONS REDUCE POLLUTION AND POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO LIKE TO DISCUSS MORE. ON IT TO DISPLACEMENT MEASURES. FINALLY WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENCOURAGE PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED PROJECTS TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE BENEFITS. TO HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING WE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS A SIMPLE TO. AND FOR THE ON GOING. TO EXPLORE UPPER. TO ENSURE THAT THIS CRITICAL TRANSITION TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND MOBILITY CHOICES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITHOUT ALSO AFFECTED CENTER ALLEN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND THE COURT TO WORKING WITH YOU GOING FORWARD. THANK THANK YOU MR BERRA I'M SORRY I AM. WENT TO THE ROOM BEFORE I FINISH THOSE ON ON THE PHONE LINE I'LL GET THIS BEFORE OF THIS MEETINGS OVER SO NOW WE WILL GO TO. ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE TO SEE IF ANYONE IS THERE JUST WE CAN SUPPORT TWENTY FORTY. FORTY TWENTY FORTY WORKING WITH IT. THEY HAVE FORTY TWO OF THREE WE'RE IN FORTY I KNOW BUT THERE'S NOBODY HERE INITIALLY THAT WANTS TO SUPPORT US ALL GET THIS DOWN HERE. OKAY NOW. WE WILL GO TO TWENTY FORTY I DO KNOW. SEE ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT DOWN. MAN- THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ON DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE MATAMATA READER THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. YES THEY LINE THEIR OPEN BILL HIGGINS IN CASSIE GILSON- THANK YOU- COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL HIGGINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS THE STATE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS ALL. EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION. AND THAT ARE AB RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE- UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE TAKING IN OPPOSE POSITION TODAY BECAUSE- WELL WE AGREE WITH SO MUCH OF WHAT SENATOR ALLEN SAID AND ABSOLUTE MOST OF THE- A PROPONENTS SAY- THIS BILL DOESN'T THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND THAT IS THERE IS A PORTION OF. BMT REDUCTION STRATEGIES BUT ARB IDENTIFIED AS HE INITIATED BNP REDUCTION STRATEGIES BUT BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR FOUR YEARS. AND THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING DONE AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS WE NEED IT'S UNFAIR TO SAY THAT B. M. T. IS RISING BECAUSE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE A COMPANY IMPLEMENTED WHEN THE STATE THAT HAS DONE NOTHING TO IMPLEMENT IT. SHARE OF THE BMT REDUCTION STRATEGIES- AND THAT'S OUR QUESTION IS WHY IS SB TWO SIXTY ONE JUST FOCUSED ON THE PORTION OF BEACH REDUCTIONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE A PLAN THAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN APPROVED THAT IS BACKED BY TRIBAL MODELS HAVE GONE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND HAVE BEEN SCRUTINIZED WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER SET OF MISSIONS. WHERE NOTHING IS DONE. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU THIS IS THE TIME FOR ACTION. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER COOPERATIVELY TO COMBINE AND INTERTWINE OUR STRATEGY IS THAT THE STATE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AND THAT BRINGS ME THE SECOND POINT ALL OF OUR OPPOSITION. IS WE BRADLEY S. B. WANTED TO REPORT REALLY CLOSELY AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL ACHIEVES WHAT THE DIRECTION WAS ON THE BILL THE REPORT CLEARLY SAYS. THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE REGIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THE WEEKS TO THE DAY R. B. MPO APPROVAL PROCESS TO ACHIEVE THAT. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ALSO NEED TO BE DONE LIKE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH PUBLIC. AND THE SHARING OF DATA IN INCREASING THE DATA FOR US TO DO THESE METRICS BUT THIS BILL IS SILENT. WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR ALL OF THE PROPONENTS MPO WILL BRING OUR MPO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WHICH BRING IN A R. B. THE STRATEGIC GROWTH APPLE IT'S THE CALTRANS. ALL OF THEM TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO A PARTNERSHIP BUT RUNNING THIS SINGLE BILL THAT SAYS NPOS YOU SHOULD BE DOING MORE WHAT WE A. R. P. SAYS. WELL IT'S INVISIBLE TO ASK US TO DO MORE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO IMPOSE PRICING PURPLE OR IMPOSE LAND USE STRUCTURES WE NEED BETTER OR THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING BETTER AND WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SO. WE'RE GOING TO OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOT ONLINE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON WITH AXIOM ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO TWO SIXTY ONE WHICH CTIA HAS IDENTIFIED AS A HOUSING KILLER PARTY GEAR. I SEE I AM OPPOSED IS TWO SIXTY ONE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES REGION TO TAKE IN FEASIBLE ACTIONS THAT MAY RENDER THEIR REGIONAL LAND USE PLANS UNACHIEVABLE WHICH PREVENTS INDIVIDUAL HOUSING PROJECTS FROM COMPLYING WITH THEM AND THEREFORE CREATES NEW SEQUEL IMPACTS. COSTS FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND EXISTING WALK OR GIVES WE PLANNING. GREEN GAS REDUCTION. THAT ARE AT THE END **** AS POSSIBLE WHILE STILL BEING ACHIEVABLE. AS MR HIGGINS EXPLAINED CARDINALIS CAN INDICATE THAT THE CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED BY REGIONAL GHG PLAN LEAVE A GAP OF ABOUT 7% TO ACHIEVE OUR STATEWIDE SCOPING PLAN GOALS FOR REDUCTIONS FROM THE LAND USE SECTOR. CARBOXYL INDICATES THAT THAT REMAINING SEVEN PERCENT. NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED BY STATE WIDE SCOPE AT STATEWIDE OFFICIATED ACTIONS NOT REGIONAL BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE ADOPTING MECHANISMS LIKE ROAD PRICING WHICH THE REGION OR THE TO DO- IN REQUIRING THEM TO DO MORE BY DEFINITION WOULD BE UNACHIEVABLE. WHY IS THIS RELEVANT TO HOME BUILDERS. HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH SEQUIN ONE SECRET OBLIGATIONS IS THAT PROJECTS COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAND USE PLANS WHICH INCLUDES. THE FAVORABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES AND A HOUSING PROJECT CAN NOT COMPLY WITH A BEACON YES IT WILL BE DETERMINED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UNDER SPEAK WHAT THAT REQUIRES FURTHER MITIGATION. I TWO SIXTY REQUIRE REGION TO ADOPT TO THE END OR PIPE GHG AND FOR. ON TOP OF THE ALREADY. FEASIBLE GHG REDUCTIONS THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN BY CAR AND CENTER REGION LIKELY CAN'T COMPLY WITH THEM APPROACH THE STATUS OF THEIR AT THE ACT IN QUESTION. AND THEREFORE ALSO GROWTH THIS WEEK WITH THAT IS THAT INDIVIDUAL HOUSING PROJECT. THAT MUST COMPLY WITH. THOSE PLANS INTO QUESTION AS WELL. AT BASS THIS WILL RAISE THE- ADVANTAGE. FOR HOUSING. EAGLE COMPLIANCE. WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WILL SPAWN LITIGATION AND AT WORST IT NEEDS THE BOTH THE PUBLICATION INSIGNIFICANT NEW MEDICATION COSTS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS. THEY CAN'T COMPLY WITH AN APPROVED PLAN. IT BEARS MENTIONING THAT ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUAL HOUSING PROJECTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO MITIGATE YOUR G. H. G. AND BMP IMPACT INDIVIDUALLY. BECAUSE AN ADDED BURDEN ON TOP OF THAT MEDICATION THAT THERE ARE YOU REQUIRED TO DO UNDER C. CLASS. YEAH A SUPPORT F. THREE SEVEN FIVE WHEN WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. IN CONTINUES TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORT A HOST OF OTHER BUILDING STANDARDS THAT FURTHER REDUCE ANY PROJECTS GHG EMISSIONS TREMENDOUSLY. WELL CA REMAINS OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON REGIONAL CLIMATE AND GHG REDUCTION STRATEGY GOING FORWARD WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE AUTHOR. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE LEGISLATION PROJECT TO PICK THE ONES. THAT WILL ADD SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO DELIVER MUCH NEEDED HOUSING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKYOU ON WE WILL NOW GO TO ROOM FOR WE'RE HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE I DO NOT SEE ANYONE ARE COMING TO THE MICROPHONE TO OPPOSE- GOING TO RAM TWENTY FORTY- NO ONE THERE. ARE SOME MONEY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THEN WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND WE NEED TO DOUBLE BACK AND LISTEN TO THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WHO ARE NOW ON. ON THE TELECONFERENCE MADAME.

THE MORNING TURNS MANY MEMBERS DO AT RANDOLPH BUT THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR WE ARE VOICING OUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. ON THIS BILL AS WRITTEN WOULD GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY UPDATING AND STRENGTHENING SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY REQUIRING NEW TARGET CREAKING SOUND THE BILITY WITHIN THE PLANNING PROCESS AND ALSO IMPROVING THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN CARD IN THE NPOS FOR THIS REASON WE ASK THE COMMITTEE. TO PASS THIS BILL WHILE WE CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA'S HISTORICALLY. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY THANK YOU. MY NUMBER SEVENTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHALLENGE ME MEMBERS JUSTICE KELLY HAMEL ON BEHALF OF THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTUALLY GEN I JUST CALLING INTO VOICE SUPPORT OF THE BILL- IN THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR TO INCORPORATE EQUITY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES.

A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GATHERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION ALIGNING ARE CONCERNED WITH ALL THE COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN THANK YOU. CAN WE DO HAVE ONE MORE AT LINE NUMBER SIXTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. TWENTY CHAIR NUMBER THE COMMITTEE AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME AND I'M SURE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO. PROVIDE COMMENT. ON SB TWO SIXTY ONE. SENATOR DOLLY. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- WE JUST DID SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE A FEW YEARS BACK AND- WE'VE TRIED TO LOOK AT. REGIONAL PLANNING FOR DEVELOPMENT. FOR MAKES SENSE AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I THINK PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE'S A VERY LARGE STATE. WITH VERY DIVERSE AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT THAN. A COMMUNITY MAYBE THE CHAIRMAN LIVES IN VERSUS A COMMUNITY I LIVE IN WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. I DROVE FOR HALF HOURS LAST NIGHT TO GET TO SACRAMENTO. AND I DRIVE SEVENTY FIVE MILES ONE WAY TO GET TO WALMART NOW THANK GOD WE HAVE AMAZON SO FIVE I REDUCE MY CARBON FOOTPRINT BECAUSE AMAZON'S BRING ALL KINDS OF STUFF TO MY COMMUNITY. WITH ONE TRIP VERSUS PEOPLE GOING ON SINGLE TRIPS AND COST GOING ALL OF THEM DO IT AND WE WERE USING THOSE ABILITIES BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A LOT MORE LESS EXPENSIVE. BUT THAT DOESN'T GET CALCULATED INTO ANY OF THESE. PROGRAMS AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY DISADVANTAGED IN A COMMUNITY IN THE STATE IS TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING IN THESE VERY SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU START PUTTING MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THE COUNTIES BY VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND THEN SEEK WERE- BURKE BURDENS OF SEQUEL TO BE ABLE TO. DO PLANNED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY DIFFICULT FOR THOSE. FOLKS TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PLANNED OR UNINTENTIONAL OR IRRITATE OR INTENTIONAL- BUT WE SEE A LOT OF LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE WHERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIVING OUT IN OUR AREAS I MEAN. SENATOR WIENER TRY TO DO A BILL IF YOU WERE AN S. R. AREA YOU COULD EVEN BUILD LAST A FEW YEARS AGO AND THANK GOD WE KILL THAT BILL BECAUSE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA'S US ALREADY AND WE NEED FOLKS OUT THERE. TENDING TO THE LAND. AND SO I WILL BE OPPOSING THIS BILL I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY NOW I THINK WE HAVE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT LAID OUT THE GROUNDWORK AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY MORE POWER. TO AN UNELECTED BODY. AT A R. B. TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE- MY REALLY POOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND BE ABLE TO BUILD A HOME SUNDAY AND IF YOU HAVE TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. A WITH A HOUSING SHORTAGE WE WON'T SEE THOSE FOLKS BE ABLE TO. STAY OUT THERE AND- I KNOW ALL THE PLANNERS OF I SAID ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND I'M TONY I SAT THROUGH MORE MEETINGS THAN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. LISTENING TO THE- PLANNERS OF THE WORLD AND LOOK WE ALL KNOW. THAT IF YOU PUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN ONE SPOT. THE BILL HIGHRISES AND COMPACTUM AND- MAKE A MALL NOT HAVE A CAR. IN YEAH THERE'S A LESS OF A FOOTPRINT. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM IT'S ABOUT CHOICE AND IT'S ABOUT BALANCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE BALLOTS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS JUST DURING THIS PANDEMIC. PEOPLE ARE FLEEING SAN FRANCISCO IN DROVES AND THEY'RE COMING TO SACRAMENTO THE HOUSING MARKET HERE IS EXPLODING I I'VE BEEN LOOKING TO TRY TO PURCHASE ONE HERE BECAUSE- THE RENT IS ALSO HIGH BUT THE HOUSING TIGHTNESS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXITING. TERENCE'S COAT THE SAME PEOPLE ARE EXITING. TWO MEYER YOU CANNOT FIND- OF HOMER PIECE OF PROPERTY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE FREAKED OUT DURING COVERT WHEN THERE WHEN EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN THEIR STOCK IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THEY AND THEY FELT COOPED UP FOR LA OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXITING. THE CITIES AND THEY AND I THINK IT WILL COME UP TO THE BUILDING THAT THEY HAVE NO FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OR TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE A PANDEMIC OR YOU HAVE SOME NATURAL DISASTER. SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE OF SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS A LOT OF POOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AN ABILITY BILL WILL STAY THERE SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE OPPOSING THIS LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS YOU HAVE A MOTION THEN. PROBABLY IF DOUBLE REFERRED YES THE TRANSPORTATION. IS THERE A MOTION MCCARTY THAT IS WHY COST. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THAT WOULD AFFECT IF YOU WANNA PULL MY CLOTHES NO IN FACT I'M GETTING. REALLY DID MANAGE THIS THING I GOT. THE GOVERNMENT MAINLY TO GIVE. TO MY CALL- I THINK YOU BRING VERY SIR CONCERN I'M LIVING TO THE SAME RIGHT NOW TRYING. FIGURE OUT HOW HERE IN SOCCER AS WELL. I'M ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT- I HOPE FOLKS UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPOSE THE SAME SORT OF PLANNING- YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS FROM A CITY ONTO A RURAL. THIS THE- FRAMEWORK THAT THAT THIS FITS INTO. AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OR CERTAINLY NOT HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD AS URBAN AREAS- THE- AIR B. SETS THE STANDARDS BASED BY REGION. AND- IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT. URBAN AND RURAL. DIFFERENCES ARE HAPPY TO LOOK AT HOW THAT. PLAYS OUT BUT BUT I BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO LEAVE THIS DISCUSSION I HAVE WITH THE SENSE THAT WERE IMPOSING THE SAME VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. STANDARDS ON SANTA MONICA IS AND BE BERMAN THIS IS NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT. PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS BY DEFINITION HAVE TO DRIVE MORE TO GET TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING. THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY BY THE WAY IS THAT THE AMAZON- ASPECT OF THIS IS FACTORED IN- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT- THAT. YOU KNOW THE STATE'S ON. WHARTON THE THIS MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DELIVERIES. AND ALL THAT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IF I'M IF I'M MISTAKEN IN THAT LET'S GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE HOW WE CAN GET THAT- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCURACY. BECAUSE I THINK YOUR POINT WELL TAKEN ABOUT ME MAKING SURE THAT. HERE WE ARE JUST OFFSITE. YOU KNOW IF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BEING OFFSET ON ONE SIDE BUT REPLACED BY SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THERE ARE OTHER AS WE'RE KIDDING OURSELVES SO- SO. THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF STANDARDS THAT ARE APPLIED TO RURAL URBAN- REGIONS AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLARIFIED AND- AND IT WAS. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN ARE JUST OF P. OFF ON THAT I TOTALLY AGREE THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT'S GIVEN THE A. R. B. IT BECOMES. YOU KNOW VERY COOKIE CUTTER AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE SOME GUIDELINES. THAT IT COMES BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE VMT IS GOING TO BE APPLIED AND- WHO HAS A FAITHFUL AND IT FEELS REMORSE. CONSCRIPTED OF. ALL IN OUR LEGISLATION SO THAT WE TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THE AUTHORITY BACK FROM THE BUREAUCRACY IS I THINK YOU MAKE A LOT OF MORE PEOPLE HAPPY ON. OF THESE KIND OF IMPOSED MANDATES THAT EVENTUALLY COME OUT OF FOR MANDATE. THE STAFF WHAT I FEEL IS THE REAL ISSUE OUT THERE WHEN I SPEAK TO PEOPLE EVERYONE IS. VERY AWARE THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALL OF THAT THAT IF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT COMES DOWN ON THEM AND THE REPRESENTATIVE IS KIND OF CUT OUT OF THE DEAL. SO I JUST AFTER GOING FORWARD YOU TAKE A LITTLE. ROCK ACTUALLY THERE ARE MANY WILL SEE. CHART ALL THROUGHOUT THIS BILL THERE'S CALLS THEIR INDIAN CREEK REQUIREMENTS FOR INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AIRBNB NPOS AND LOCALS. BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE ACTUALLY SENATOR THERE'S BEEN. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH COMMUNICATION THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DATA. SHARING- AND SO I YEAH. SO NOW EFFECT BE STRENGTH LET'S LET'S TO A LOOK AT A AND WORK ON A TOGETHER. WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND YOU HAVE MAJOR CLOSE AND IDEA TO PEIA FINANCE. I AM TOTALLY OUT OF SUCH A PROVOCATIVE THAT MOMENTUM I. CASUAL ANYWAY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIVES ME THE MOTION- MADAM PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TWO SIX ONE BY SENATOR ALAN THE MOTION IS DUE PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION ALAN. ALLEN AYE BATES NO. BATES NO DALY NO DALLY NO GONZALEZ HI. AND SALAS I SKINNER. STERN Y. CASCADE HIGH. THREE THREE THEN WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS WHO WILL BE ABA FINING ON AND NOW I KNOW THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OUR COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. WELL THE ROLE OF IT RIGHT NOW THREE TWO. ZERO REGION IN WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SB THREE FORTY THREE SAT CORRECT YES AND I APOLOGIZE MEMBERS FOR. PICKING UP AT THE CHECK OF THIS MORNING'S- THIS BILL I YOU KNOW I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF YOU ON. ON- TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR- ARE. SOME OF THE GREAT. STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT EXIST FOR THE GUARDS TO. WASTE AND PLASTIC AND- AND THE IMPACT OF THIS NOT HAVING NOT ONLY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO IN OUR CITIES. I HAD IT ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT I'VE- COME HERE. TO BE PAINFULLY AWARE OF. IS HOW THE AND THE MARKETING CLAIMS THAT OUR ON PRODUCTS ARE IS GETTING SO OUT OF WHACK WITH THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE SEE. THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THEIR PRODUCT AND THEY PUT IN THE RECYCLING BIN. I THINK FULLY EXPECTING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RECYCLED AND OF COURSE AS SO MANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE NOT. SO A CURRENT LAW. THIS IS THE INTERESTING THINGS MEMBERS CURRENT LAW. PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING AN ENTRY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS SUCH AS- YOU KNOW. RECYCLABLE YOU CAN'T LAKE RECYCLABLE ON. TOP OF A PRODUCT IF IT'S NOT RECYCLABLE IT'S NOT A TRULY RECYCLABLE BUT- ARE THE LAW DOES NOT COVER THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT RECYCLING SYMBOL THAT WE ALL. KNOW AND SEE ON OUR ON OUR ON OUR PRODUCTS. SO NOW ARE. EVERYBODY THINKS OF THAT SYMBOL MEANS THAT IT MEANS IS THIS IS RECYCLABLE SO A LOT OF A LOT OF COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT RECYCLABLE ON THEIR ON THEIR PRODUCTS STILL GO AHEAD AND PUT THE RECYCLE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THEIR PRODUCTS. AND THEN THEY SAY OH WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CURSE PEOPLE TO RECYCLE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY DECEPTIVE. AND IT IN BYTHE WAY THE TRUTH IS THAT LESS THAN 15% OF OUR SINGLE USE% PLASTICS. ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECYCLED- AND RECYCLING COSTS NOW EXCEED THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL ITSELF. CONSUMERS AS I SAY ARE DUTIFULLY FILLING THEIR BLUE BINS. OUT WITH ITEMS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE RECYCLING NOW WE STARTED TO CALL THIS PHENOMENON WHICH CYCLING BECAUSE- IN PEOPLE DAVEY WATER PRODUCTS TO BE RECYCLED AND THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK THAT ALL THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE BUYING IS GOING TO TREAT TO THE LANDFILL. NOT ONLY IS SO MUCH TO GOING TO LANDFILL BUT ACTUALLY THE PROCESS OF WISH CYCLING IS ACTUALLY CREATING A LOT OF CONTAMINATION- IN THE WASTE STREAM BECAUSE THE MORE STUFF GOING INTO THE RECYCLING BINS THAT ARE NOT TRULY RECYCLABLE. THE MORE IT HAS TO GET SORTED OUT THE MORE OF IT ENDS UP GETTING STUCK INTO BALES OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. IT'S PART OF WHY CHINA ACTUALLY PUT THE KIBOSH ON ALL OUR MATERIALS BEING SENT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE SENDING BALES OF RECYCLED FOR PURPORTEDLY RECYCLING MATERIAL RECYCLABLE MATERIAL THAT WERE CONTAMINATED BY. OTHER MATERIALS AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU HAVE OF MATERIAL IS NOT ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE THEN HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE CONVEYOR BELT AT THE RECYCLING FACILITY HAS TO BE CARTED AWAY TO A LANDFILL THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS IF MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN. TO A SORTING FACILITY RECYCLING FACILITY OR DUMP- I CAN'T- ENCOURAGE YOU MORE TO GO. IT'S SUCH A IT'S AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE- SO. IT THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED THAT WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY- YOU KNOW. EXTEND THE- BASICALLY THE ANTI FRAUD LANGUAGE THAT THAT EXISTS WITH REGARD TO PUTTING RECYCLABLE ON YOUR BOTTLE TO THE RECYCLING SYMBOL THAT EVERYONE THINKS OF. AS MEANING RECYCLABLE AND SO WITH ME ADD TO THE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY WE'VE GOT EMILY RICH WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP OF KALBURGI ALSO MARKET PRAYER WITH REPUBLIC SERVICES HE WORKS IN. THE WASTE MANAGEMENT SPACE. BY THE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED MA'AM THOSE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS EMILY RASH- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALPERS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP FOR A STATE WIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST CONSUMERS ASSUME THAT THAT SHAPING EUROPE AND BALL SIGNIFIES I DIDN'T ABLE TO BE RECYCLED. MANY OF US MYSELF INCLUDED TAKE THE TIME TO CHECK EVERY CONTAINER YEARS AND IF I SEE THAT YOUR AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE ON THE COMPUTER I RINSED OUT THOROUGHLY AND HEARD IN THE PRESENT. I'M UNFORTUNATELY AFTER ALLEN STATED EFFORT AFTER SUPPORT CORRECT ANY THAT LESS THAN 50% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY RECYCLED. MANY MANUFACTURERS USE THE T. CARE OF NUMBER ONE THAT PART CONTAINERS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAN. REGARDLESS WHETHER THE TAPE OF CLASS TO GET. USED IS TYPICALLY RECYCLE OR WHETHER ADDITIONAL PACKAGING ON TOP OF THE PLASTIC CONTAINER LIKE A PLASTIC SLEEVE. MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CONTAINER TO BE RECYCLED. AFFECTIONS ALSO PLACE ADDITIONAL SHIPPING AND BOTH PROMINENTLY ON THE FRONT OR BACK OF THEIR PACKAGING. REGARDLESS OF THE ACTUAL RECYCLABILITY OF THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE A PLASTIC WITH CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. AFTER SPEAKING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE PLANET FROM THE DEPTHS OF LAKE TAHOE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MARIANA TRENCH. PLASTIC WASTE IS ALSO CREATING A FINANCIAL BURDEN ULTIMATELY BORNE BY CONSUMERS RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS TO UP TO PAY TO GET RID OF THAT. WE NEED COMPANIES TO START USING RECYCLED MATERIAL TO CREATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND ENSURE THAT THOSE PRODUCTS ARE MADE SO THAT THEY CAN BE RECYCLED BACK INTO NEW PRODUCTS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MARKET PLACE TO REWARD GOOD ACTORS AND AVOID BAD. ACTORS CONSUMERS ARE DUPED. I THINK THREE FORTY WILL HELP. BY CLICKING WHICH ARE ABLE TO BE RECYCLED. AND WHICH WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY END UP IN A LANDFILL- I THOUGHT. THANK YOU AND I THINK OUR NEXT SPEAKER. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES CENTER ALLEN THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT MEASURE DESIGNED TO INCREASE RECYCLING EFFICIENCY. CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND EFFICIENT RECYCLING SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD BUT IN SPITE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING INVESTED INTO A SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE RECYCLING CONTAMINATION REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND EXPENSIVE OBSTACLES. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN EXTENSIVE MANUAL SORT LINES OPTICAL SORTERS SCREENS AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CONSUMER EDUCATION EFFECTIVE SOURCE REDUCTION. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THEIR LOCAL HAULERS SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY EDUCATING. OUR CUSTOMERS ON WHAT IS RECYCLED IT IN EFFECT IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE RECYCLING RATES AND REDUCE CONTAMINATION. BUT THESE DOLLARS ARE WASTED IF THE PACKAGING OR MATERIALS INCLUDE MARKINGS THAT FALSELY CLAIM THESE PACKAGES OR MATERIALS ARE RECYCLABLE FALSE CLAIMS OF RECYCLABILITY CONFUSE CUSTOMERS WHO ALREADY STRUGGLE TO IDENTIFY CORRECTLY WHAT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE RECYCLING BIN. SB FOUR THREE FOUR THREE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT TRUTH IN ADVERTISING I DON'T CLAIM YOUR PACKAGING OR MATERIAL IS RECYCLABLE UNLESS OUR ACTUAL RECYCLING MARKETS FOR THE MATERIAL AND IT CAN BE READILY AND EFFICIENTLY REMOVED FROM THE WASTE STREAM. AS AN EXAMPLE PLASTIC FILM BAGS WHILE OFFERING CONSUMERS ARE RELATIVELY CHEAP PACKAGING OPTION WEIGH VERY LITTLE FOR RECYCLING PURPOSES AND CONSTITUTE LESS THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL LAKE STREET. HIT THESE BAGS CLOG RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING MACHINERY CREATE LITTER PROBLEMS AT FACILITIES AND ARE EXPENSIVE TO REMOVE FROM THE WASTE STREAM. CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE BAGS AND OTHER MATERIALS LIKE IT ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE UNLESS THE MARKET EXISTS AND THESE CAN BE- MATERIALS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY REMOVED FROM THE WASTE STREAM. SB SIX THREE FORTY THREE CENTS AN EFFECTIVE AND CLEAR STANDARD FOR RECYCLABILITY THAT WILL INCREASE RECYCLING EFFICIENCIES IMPROVE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN RECYCLING AND WILL REDUCE RECYCLING COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND RECYCLERS.

WARRANTY ONE OF OUR- YEAH SURE- GOOD MORNING CHALLEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LORN AGAR AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING AMERICAN THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR PACKAGING AND THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE THE ONLY MATERIAL NEUTRAL PACKAGING ASSOCIATION AND THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS WITH THE QUALITY OF THE CALIFORNIA AND MANY MORE MANY MORE IMPORT TACKING MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS INTO THE STATE. I AM BUYING TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE FORTY THREE THAT IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IT WOULD RESTRICT THE USE OF THE CHASING ERA SYMBOL BY ITSELF OR SURROUNDING A RED MAGNIFICATION CODE. OR ANY OTHER SYMBOL OR STATEMENT INDICATING A PRODUCT IS RECYCLABLE IF THE PRODUCT IS NOT DEEMED TO BE RECYCLABLE BY TWO HOURS AGO. SRI ARE MUCH REPAIRABLE- AROUND READ MY DEATH. CODE IS THAT MANY STATES REQUIRE IT BY LAW. INDIVIDUAL STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA ARE REMOVING THE MANDATE FOR PACKAGING THE HABIT YOU THINK ARROWS AND- THE RANK. BUT AMONG A MAJORITY ARE STILL REQUIRING THEM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE PROHIBITION THAT YOU THINK. WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC. FOR COMPANIES THAT USE THE NATIONAL- HOW TO RECYCLE LABEL ON THEIR PACKAGING WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAS BEEN CHASING A- PICTURE ON IT. THE GOAL OF THE HOW TWO RECYCLE LABEL TO REDUCE CONSUMER CONFUSION WITH A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT RECYCLING LABEL AND CORRESPONDING INFORMATIONAL WEBSITE. THIS IS SO CONSUMERS CAN PROPERLY RECYCLE THE PACKAGE WITH RB BY TELLING THEM TO CHECK LOCALLY OR TO REMEMBER SHRINK LABEL ON A BOTTLE OF MAIL. BEFORE RECYCLING THE BOTTLES. MANY AMERICANS ARE WERE TO AND THE SIZE AND USE OF THEIR PACKAGING. WE ALSO BELIEVE CONSUMER SHOULD BEGIN ACTOR IN. ABOUT THE RISKS. OF THE PRODUCTS IN THE PACKAGES THAT THEY ARE PURCHASING. WE BELIEVE THAT ADOPTING NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR LABELS AND PACKAGING WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN MAKING SURE MORE MATERIAL IS MORE CHILL GETTING RECYCLED AND WILL STOP CONSUMER CONFUSION. STE CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RECYCLE PACKAGING THAT IS RECYCLABLE AND MANUFACTURE MANY FACTORS MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. THAT WILL HELP CONSUMERS DO SO. THREE THE COMIC THAT WE HAD WITH THE CHAIRED OFFICE AND WE BELIEVE THAT BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE A SOLUTION WITH ALL CONTAMINATION IN THE CURBSIDE BINS. AND HELP MORE MATERIAL GET.

YEAH AT THIS TIME MANAGER WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MADAM ODERATOR WE WILL NOW COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY- COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OR ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR DONNELLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RIGHT HERE OKAY SO I JUST HAVE A QUICK COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR- I HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY. MR A PRAYER THAT. INDICATED ABOUT MARKET DEMAND SO. I UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL I GO BACK A LONG WAYS. IN THE RECYCLING WORLD IN PLASTICS SENATOR GORDON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GORDON I WORKED ON A- LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT- BUT WHAT WAS NEEDLES YET WAS RELEASED THE- ANYWAY THERE IT IS COMPLEX IT IS FRUSTRATING AND SO I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT BUT I SO THERE'S A 75% RECYCLE. RIGHT NOW MANDATE THAT WE HAVE ON. PLASTICS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CONTAMINATION AND THAT CAUSES US NOT TO BE ABLE TO. THE I GUESS MARKET THE PRODUCT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IF. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE POWER TO CARRY CYCLE TO EVALUATE SYMBOLS. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT GIVING THEM THE POWER NUMBER ONE I DON'T MIND US PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH ONES WE THINK WITH GOOD TESTIMONY AND- AND UNDERSTAND THE MARKETABILITY AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT TO JUST GIVE THEM THE POWER IF THEY DON'T MEET TO SEVENTY SO LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE. THEY BANNED SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T. I GUESS. LEGIT I GUESS SOME PEOPLE FRAUD IN THE SYSTEM BUT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT AND I'M NOT I'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT'S WHAT I USED TO MEET WITH THE WIND BAND THE PRODUCTS- THEY WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CLAIM THAT IT. YOUR ITEMS RECYCLABLE WHEN IT'S NOT. RECYCLABLE IN THE END OF THE DAY WHEN IT'S NOT BEING RECYCLED. OKAY SO THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE KEY WORD YOU JUST SAID THEY'RE NOT BEING IS IT RECYCLABLE OR IS IT NOT RECYCLABLE. THIS IS THE TIRES OR RECYCLE BUT YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THEM AND NOW SO THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. ABSOLUTELY SENATORS. THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN IN IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THAT IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE UNDER PERFECT CONDITIONS YOU CAN. PUT IT IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT BUT A THOUSAND DEGREES AND THAT INCREDIBLE EXPENSE. TURN IT INTO SOMETHING NEW. AND THAT IS TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE. BUT IN IN IN THE REAL WORLD IN REAL DAY LIFE EVERYDAY LIFE THESE ITEMS ARE GARCIA. THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO MARKET THERE WHETHER BE WHETHER BE FOR WHAT THE BE THE SORTING PROCESS OR WITH THE BE THE MARKET. WHETHER BE THE AS THE COST OF THAT BUT THE ENERGY EXPENDITURE ASSOCIATED WITH WITH TURN THESE THINGS INTO SOMETHING NEW. FOR WHATEVER REASON THESE ITEMS DON'T END UP GETTING RECYCLED IN THE DAY NOW. THIS IS A WORK TO GET SOME TRUTH IN ADVERTISING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO DOESN'T REALIZE THAT THESE TEMS ARE NOT GETTING RECYCLED. HAS A BETTER SENSE NOW HERE'S THE THING. IF WE CAN CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE ITEMS TO BE RECYCLED THIS. THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROVIDES A PATH. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED NOW. TO GET. YOU KNOW TO GET INTO THE RECYCLABLE CATEGORY- AND THEN I CAN TALK ABOUT IF YOU LIKE. BUT I BELIEVE THE WHAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO DO IS TO CONTINUE TO. IN A PUT THESE CHASING ARROW SYMBOLS ON TO THEIR PRODUCTS WHEN IN ACTUALITY THESE ITEMS ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED. SO BUT WE BUT IN TERMS OF INCENTIVIZING I'M I'M I'M HAPPY TO YOU KNOW TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT THIS BUT- YOU KNOW LIKE ALL ALL TAKE A- THERE'S AN ON RAMP THAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW MANUFACTURERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE THE PRODUCT WHILE THEY MAKE. THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO COLLECT IN STORE AND THEN WE PROCESS IT AND THEN THEY CAN IF THEY'RE ABLE TO CREATE A MECHANISM WHERE THEIR ITEMS ACTUALLY STARTING TO GET RECYCLED AND THEY CAN. THEN THEY CAN PUT THE CHASING ARSENAL'S BACK ON. SO THE- I THINK THEY HAVE THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE REALLY DELIGHTED OUT THAT THIS BILL S NOT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE RECYCLED THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S JUST NOT GETTING RECYCLED BECAUSE THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO ARE THERE OR THE COST IS TOO HIGH SO. WHEN I WHEN I LOT OF FACTORS YEAH THERE IS REALLY SO IT'S WHEN YOU SAY IT'S CONTAMINATING THE BAIL. SO THIS I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT. AND I DID I COULD. FEEL MY NEWSPAPER BACK LIKE A FILM THAT I THAT'S OF BROKEN DAMAGED. IT IS RECYCLABLE TECHNICALLY BUT THE WAYS PEOPLE HATE IT BECAUSE IT BASICALLY JUST MESSES UP THE BALES IT'S NEVER ALTERNATELY RECYCLED GETS RIPPED UP. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON THAT PIECE IS THAT THAT SAYING IT'S JUST DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD. OFOR ITS RECYCLE BUT WE JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS TOO COSTLY OR WHATEVER SO YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS IS. I'M TRYING TO. I JUST WEST OF THE BETTER SOLUTIONS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IN THIS YEAH I KNOW I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO PUT IT OFF ON THE- IT'S GOING TO PUT IT OFF ON THE MANUFACTURE. IS GONNA GET POWER MORE POWER TO CAL RECYCLE WHICH- AT. THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANT. I MEAN. THE BETTER SOLUTION IS SB FIFTY FOUR RIGHT I MEAN ARE YOU OF THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO THIS. WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT WE WOULD BASICALLY BE ASKING THE PRODUCERS IN GENERAL TO START. MOVING TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING. RIGHT WE WENT TO I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE WHAT'S REAL BILL IDEA TO HOLD BACK A MONTH HERE AND THERE'S THIS ONE REACHES ONE DOESN'T IN THE- COMING BACK WE'RE COMING BACK WITH A BILL. PLUS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN SECOND SYMBOL. THAT YOU'RE SAYING. SO WHAT I'M SO WHAT'S GOING TO. IF YOU TAKE. JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE WE TAKE DECEMBER OFF. THE CARRY CYCLE TAKES IS OFF OF THESE PRODUCTS THAT. DON'T MEET SOME CERTAIN CRITERIA BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT GETTING RECYCLED. THOSE ARE GOING TO GOING TO A LANDFILL NOW. WHICH IS WHERE THE GOING OUT ANYWAY BY THE WAY. RIGHT SO WE HAVE A. 75% REDUCTION. IS CALDERON CARISSA ACKLES GOAL HAPPENS IN. WHATEVER WE CAN'T MEET THAT BECAUSE WE'RE DUMPING ALL THESE RECYCLABLES AND YOU ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR SB FIFTY FOUR AND I HOPE TO CONVINCE YOU TO BE A CO AUTHOR. WELL IT I FIND IT HARD TO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING THAT IS- FOR GIVING MORE POWER TO THE COUNTY CYCLING ALSO IT'S CONFUSING THAT THIS COULD CONFUSE FIVE AND THESE BRING THESE BRANDS ARE NATIONAL BRANDS THEY'RE THEY'RE WHAT ARE OTHER STATES. I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY WAY FURTHER AHEAD IN MANDATING THAT OTHER STATES ARE THERE OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THE SAME THING SO ACTUALLY WASHINGTON AND OREGON- ALL THREE STATES HAVE HAVE ANNOUNCED SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SO THE IDEA IS THAT- THAT- THAT THAT DID YOU KNOW WHAT BUT HOPEFULLY HUMAN AND THEN THEY LOOK TO HAVE A DECENT CHANCE OF PASSAGE THAT WILL THIS IS GOING TO HELP THE PUSH JUST LIKE WITH THE NC DOUBLE A MEMBER. MEMBER THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE NC DOUBLE A SAID THERE'S NO WAY AN ANTI SKINNER HAD A BILL ON ON THE ATHLETES RIGHT A COMPENSATING THEM AND THEY SAID THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAN'T GO OUT ON ITS OWN. THIS IS THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS WE'RE GONNA CUT THE PAC TEN OUT OF THE NC DOUBLE A WELL SHE SAID THIS IS UNFAIR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ANYWAY AND IN FACT DAN THE NC DOUBLE A ENDED UP ADOPTING WITHIN ABOUT A. YEAR THE ADOPTED CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. SO- IT'S TRUE THE COUNTRY. HAS NOT. MOVED ENOUGH ON THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND- I WAS ON A CONFERENCE CALL OF LEGISLATION OF THE COUNTRY THEY KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE. AND SO YOU SEE MORE MORE STATES TRY TO STICK TO STAND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN CONJUNCTION WITH. OREGON WASHINGTON TO JUST RESET THE CONVERSATION NATIONALLY BECAUSE WE'RE BASICALLY LYING TO OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. YOUR I MEAN I CENTER FRUSTRATION IS A REAL FRUSTRATION. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THE STUFF NOT BEING RECYCLED. AND ALL IT'S DOING IS COMING UP THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THAT AT THE VERY LEAST UNTIL WE CREATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. ARE WE WE'RE WE'RE LYING TO OURSELVES IF WE IF WE CONTINUE TO. CLAIM THAT THESE ITEMS ARE BEING RECYCLED WHEN THEY'RE NOT. I'M IT. FIRST OF ALL I'M A LAY OFF YOUR BILL I WANT I WANT TO GET TERE. BECAUSE I GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THE PATHWAYS AND- BUT I WANTED TO MAKE A STATEMENT SO. I WAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN THEY- DID FIFTY PERCENT. OUT OF LANDFILLS WE ACTUALLY HAD LENTILS BEFORE. THIS IS IN THE NINETIES. WHEN WE STARTED. IN YOU KNOW THERE'S A DON JUAN IS TALK ABOUT TIRES FOR ME BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING TO ME AND- SOMEBODY WHO. OWNS TRUCKS AND USES. TIRES A LOT OF THEM. I PAY THE FEE. AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET IT GO BACK AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE- DEALER THAT I BOUGHT TE TIRE FROM WHEN I GET MY FOUR BUCKS OR I GET IT WHATEVER. IT GETS RECYCLED. BUT I ALSO HAVE A CONCRETE COMPANY IN MY DISTRICT THAT CAN USE THOSE TIRES THEY ACTUALLY CAN TURN UP TO IT WHATEVER DEGREES I GOTTA BURN AND MAKE CONCRETE SOMETHING WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA. SO BUT THAT BUT THEIR BOARD IS IN CONFLICT WITH MY- CONCRETE SUPPLIER AND PUTTING REGULATIONS ON THEM BECAUSE OF THE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS THERE SO HE DOESN'T REALLY GET WRIST YOU DON'T EAT IT WE SHIP THEM-TO CHINA. AND THEY BURN THE HECK OUT OF I'M NOT EVEN IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT LIKE WE UP. AND IT WAS ABOUT FRUSTRATING IS LIKE WHAT WOULD AND WE FEEL GOOD WE FEEL ALL GOOD BECAUSE WE CHARGE THE- MONEY TO THE- BUSINESS. OF TIRED THE TIRE GOT. RECYCLE BUT I GOT SENT TO CHINA. IN A BOOK GOT PUT A BOILER ISSUE CANNOT SMOKE THAT I'M READING. WHAT WE DO WE REALLY SAW THE AIR QUALITY PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED WE SAID NO WE DIDN'T WE SHOULD LOOK INCENTIVES TO USE THOSE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE LEADING THE WAY. THE NATION IN. THE STRATEGY BUT IT DIDN'T DAVEY IF WE CAN'T GO FULL CYCLE. AND MAKE IT HAPPEN HERE NO JUST SHOVING IT OFF TO SOME OTHER STATE OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY WHERE THEY'RE- NOT MEETING THE STANDARD WHAT GOOD ARE WE DOING TO SAME THING YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT. JUST THROWN IN THE LANDFILL AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT YEAH SO THE ONLY OFF YOUR BILL I. BUT I'LL BE BACK THERE ON FIFTY FOUR LOOK AT THAT ONE TOO BUT DO THEY KNOW AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO. BE HONEST WITH THE PEOPLE. YEP THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY DOING WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE DOING IT BUT WE'RE CHARGING YOU. YEAH AND WE'RE ALSO. NOT ALLOW YOU TO RECYCLE SO. IT DOESN'T IT ALL. TWO COMES OUT IS HEY YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S LEADING WAY. WE DO ALL THESE THINGS FEEL. BUT REALLY. IF YOU. DOWN DEEP GET AND WE- IT DOESN'T DO WHAT WE- WE'RE DOING. I THINK DEMóCRATAS. GUYS DO MAKE. A CASE FIFTY. YOU'RE MAKING THE CASE FOR HER TO- BUT- BUT DID NOT. FALLING UP IN WITH. PANEL WHO GETS PENALIZED IT COULD. IT MANY EITHER PAYS MORE AT THE END THEY GO PAY MORE IT SOME GOT TO DO SO TO CHANGE THE ORDER SUCKED COUNTY DISTRICT RATES TEND A MONTH- I DON'T I'M LIVING HERE TRUST ME YEAH MY WELL BILL WILL UP TO THE SO. WHO IS THE WHO DID THEY AND DO. WE ENDS UP. IS THE CONSUMER. YEAH YOU CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF ALL THESE THERE'S THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOUSANDS OF PROGRAMS INCOME IF YOU WANT TO GET FIRED UP ABOUT THE AIRPORT I WILL. BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. MY POINT IS THAT THE CONSUMER PAYS. EVERYBODY FEELS GOOD ABOUT IT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT JUST RUN THE RATE UP SO. ALL THE SOLVE THE PROBLEM LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WAYS WE CAN KEEP THESE. PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE THE MAKE THE FOR LOOP. HERE'S THE THING A SENATOR. ON THERE ARE SOME ITEMS THAT ARE VERY FOR RECYCLABLE SOME PLASTIC ITEMS THE ONES AND THE TWOS RATES THE P. T. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE THREE TWO SEVENS WHICH ARE NOT. RIGHT THE LADIES AREN'T THERE THAT YOU KNOW FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THEY'RE NOT RECYCLABLE TECHNICALLY THEY ARE BUT BY THE SYSTEM IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO MAKE A PENCIL OUT. THE TRUTH THE MATTER IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PLASTIC MANUFACTURES THE ONE TO HOLD THE CONTROLS HERE THEY CAN AB CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO MARKET THAT THE CAT FOOD. YOU KNOW BOTTLE IN A IN A IN A IN A IN A NUMBER THREE OR NUMBER TWO. AND IF THEY GIVE ME PUT IN THE ONE OR TWO IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RECYCLE THAN THE NUMBER THREE AND YET RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME. THEY TO PUT WHATEVER PRODUCT THEY WANT AND THERE'S REALLY NO ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AS YOU SAY IT'S ULTIMATELY TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE BECAUSE THEY EXISTED ON PUTTING OUT THE NON RECYCLABLE STUFF WHEN THEY ACTUALLY COULD PUT OUT THE RECYCLABLE STUFF. AND AS A RESULT OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH OF THE NON RECYCLABLE STUFF GOING TO THE STREAM AS OPPOSED TO THE RECYCLABLE STUFF APART- WE WANT TO DO HERE. IS PUSHED AGAINST THE PUSH THE PRODUCERS. TOWARD THE MORE RECYCLABLE STUFF. THAT'S ALL. THE GOAL HERE. AND IF WE DO THAT THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE CONSUMERS ON THE- IN IN A VERY TANGIBLE WAY. THIS CAN HELP THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK BETTER. IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH LESS LIKELY. THAT DID YOU KNOW THE HOLLER CAN CONTINUE TO ASK FOR RATE INCREASES IN THE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PASS THESE RATE INCREASES ON PEOPLE. TO BASICALLY BANDAID OVER THIS BROKEN SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY. YOU THE CONSUMERS ARE PAYING THE COST FOR DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY THE PRODUCERS ULTIMATELY SO WE NEED TO START HOLDING THOSE PRODUCERS ACCOUNTABLE TO PROTECTIVE AND PUSH THEM IN IN A MORE IN A IN A IN A MORE COHERENT SUSTAINABLE DIRECTION AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL HERE AT WITH THIS BILL IT'S A GOAL WITH FIFTY FOUR IT'S ALSO A GOAL OF LEARNING IT'S ALWAYS A BILLS DOING DRESSING YOU SHOULD YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS THE BASIC SO YOU CAN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR DIVERSION WHEN YOU'RE SENDING STUFF OUT OF STATE AND IT'S GETTING BURNED. THE IT'S ALL ABOUT. CREATING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MORE TRUTH. AND PROVIDING OUR CONSUMERS WITH WITH. WITH WITH WITH WITH THE WITH THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. BECAUSE RIGHTNOW THEY JUST THINK THEY THROW THEIR STUFF IN A BLUE BIN AND EVERYTHING GOES OFTEN. IS TAKEN CARE OF AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT. AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE PAYING THE PRICE NOW BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING DYSFUNCTION OF OUR SYSTEM. I WANTED PER SE. I LOVE THIS COMMUNITY THIS IS MY FAVORITE COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I LOVE THE PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE ALL ALL OF YOU ARE THOUGHTFUL AND- AND IT ALLOWS US TO GET IN THE WEEDS APPRECIATE THAT. BUT WE TALK ABOUT TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH IS THAT. THAT HAS TO BE TO THE DOESN'T GET TOLD. IS THAT. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO EVERYTHING THAT A- THAT WE LEAD THE WORLD IN EVERYTHING AND WE ALSO LEAD THE WORLD IN POVERTY WE THE LITTLE WORLD AND- HIGHEST TAXES. HIGHEST ENERGY COST. BACK OUR HOUSES ARE BUILT DON'T DON'T KNOW I MEAN NOW THEIR STANDARDS ARE ARE OUTSTANDING WELL WHAT. THERE'S NO PLACE THAT WE DO DO IT ANY BETTER BUT THE COST. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP PEOPLE HERE. EXPORTING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ALL THESE THINGS ADD LAYERS. TO THE COSTS AND THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU JUST READ WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT. YOU KNOW MY BILL WENT UP TEN BUCKS AN AYE AND TRUST ME- I RECYCLED I GOT THE BLUE BINS MY DAUGHTER NINE FIGURE TRYING TO DO YOU KNOW THIS THE FIRST. BE LIVING SECOND ACTUALLY OF THE HOME. WE'RE RENTING A HOME WHERE WE ACTUALLY DO IT WE HAVE TO GO TO OUR LANDFILL. IT IN LASSEN COUNTY TO THE TRANSFER STATION. AND PUT IT IN THE EACH BEEN THERE. SO WE RECYCLE AT HOME IT DOESN'T GET SO IT'S GOES TUMOR FORGET STAND HAND RECYCLED. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CURBSIDE WHEN YOUR- HOUSES ARE. TWENTY MILES APART. OKAY SO. I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT THE- I'M ONLY OFF YOUR BILL APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT THE STORY TO BE TOLD THAT YOU KNOW. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN. THIS CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE ANY PEOPLE LEFT OR JUST HAVING A EAK BUNCH OF PEOPLE. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE LOWER AND WE TALK ABOUT. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THIS THIS ALL IMPACTS OF THE- SINGLE MOM WHO'S GOING TO THE STORE AND TRYING TO BUY. DISINFECTANT WIPES RIGHT NOW TO KEEP THEIR FAMILY SAFE. ALL SAY IS THAT THERE ARE SOME BILLS WE PASS HERE THAT THEY DO RAISE COSTS ON PEOPLE THIS ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT TRYING TO LOWER COSTS AND PEOPLE RIGHTS ALTERNATELY ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE COST DRIVERS THAT ARE DRIVING OUR OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOWN. AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WILL MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE COHERENT AND ULTIMATELY LESS EXPENSIVE FOR REGULAR FOLKS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I JUST. VENTURA COUNTY DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING NO NO AFTER THAT. I THINK I THINK THEY COVERED ALL EXCEPT I DO ARE JUST THAT IT OPPOSE SCRIPTED FIGHT NIGHT LIVE OF ALL ABOUT THE CONSUMER AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE CONSUMERS LOOK AT THE PACKAGE AND LOOK FOR THE FINE RIGHT NOW THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN RECYCLE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FULL STANDARDIZED EDUCATION SENSE WHAT WAS THAT. AB EIGHTY NINE OR SB EIGHTY NINE MANY MANY YEARS AGO SO CONSUMER EDUCATION IS PROBABLY FUNDAMENTAL BEFORE ANY OF THESE WORKING YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPONENT IN HERE FOR THAT I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU ADVERTISE IN THE LA TIMES MAYES THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS FOR ABOUT A MONTH FULL PAGE THIS IS NO LONGER RECYCLABLE THEY FINALLY GET IT BUT THEY DON'T NOW. BECAUSE I NEVER LOOK I'M STILL OPERATING ON WHAT MIGHT LOCAL WE NOW HAVE THE I. ORGANIC WASTES LITTLE LITTLE BANDS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND INITIALLY WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE BECAUSE THE EDUCATION ARM WAS A LITTLE LACKING SO I THINK OUR OUR WAY FATHERS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN GREAT PARTNERS UP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WANT TO DO IT RIGHT IN THE WATER YOU KNOW OFF CONSUMERS YOU KNOW NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS WITH A BLUE AND BLACK AND GREEN DOWN TO DO IT RIGHT BUT THAT'S QUITE LACKING HIS SOUL LOOKING FOR A SIGN THAT'S GOT THAT LITTLE THING ON IT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE DO THAT EVEN IF IT'S- AN ON AND CATCHING THE PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT A DAY. THIS NEW LAW IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ENFORCEMENT MORE EMPLOYEES MARKOFF SO I JUST THINK TAKING A LOOK AT AN EDUCATION COMPONENT TO ALL THIS IS REALLY VERY VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WITHOUT I'M JUST GOING TO LAUGH BECAUSE I DO AGREE DOWN I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET THERE ABSOLUTELY BACK. ON THIS IS A STEP IN A KIND OF THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT LACKS WITHIN PEOPLE KNOW YOU JUST LEADING INDUSTRY NO AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I'VE LEARNED JUST BEING HERE. OF IN FIVE STARTED CHANGING MY AT HOME MYSELF TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT I'M THROWING IN YOU KNOW THE GREEN BAN IN THE BLUE. BAND FELT I'M JUST. DECEMBER POSTSCRIPT BET. WITH THE FOR MY CLOTHES I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS- THIS IS SO TO MEET HIM YOU KNOW. ONE COULD ARGUE THAT FIFTY IS MORE OF A- LEADING INDUSTRY NOW. THIS IS TRUE ABOUT EDUCATIN BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE PRODUCERS PUT ON THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE SENT OUT TO THE TO THE CONSUMERS. THE CONSUMER BRANDS WITH A FOCUS IN EVERY ONE OF US IMPORTANT INDUSTRY PLAYERS IN THE SPACE DID A POLL AND SO IN NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF ALL CONSUMERS. THANK YOU THAT RECYCLING SYMBOL MEANS THAT THE ITEMS FULLY RECYCLABLE AND IT MEANS IT SHOULD BE PUT IN THE IN THE BLUE BIN. FIVE SO THAT YOU TOO SO LEAVE THE DATA WE HAVE LISTED THE SURVEY DATA WE HAVE SUGGESTS THAT THAT THE USE OF THAT SYMBOL IS A POWERFUL SYMBOL AND IT REALLY DOES DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE DECIDES TO PUT IN THE BLUE BIN OR NOT AND SO- TO THIS DISPUTE WITH IT IF YOU IF ANYTHING IF YOU IS ONE THING TO TAKE OUT ADS IN THE L. A. TIMES BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU THINK AND ALWAYS THIS ITEM RECYCLABLES AND NOT IF YOU GOT IT THERE ON ON THE ITEM RIGHT THERE SMACK DAB ON THE ITEMS THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY OVERRIDES- IN THE CONSUMER'S MINE IN THERE. IT'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THROWN IN OR NOT AND SO THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT. SIGNALING THE CONSUMERS. AT THE- RATE. BILL OF AN ITEM. AT AND JUST TRUTH IN ADVERTISING- ITSELF. ANYWAY WE HAD A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION HAPPY TO TALK TO EVERYBODY IN AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION SPEAKERS THE EFFORT FOR TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE WAY OF LETTING THIS PLANE I MEAN ULTIMATELY YEAH THIS IS NOT DOING AWAY WITH PLASTIC- PRODUCTS ARE PACKAGING IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO BE TRUTHFUL TO CONSUMERS AS TO THE TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE NOT THOSE THAT ARE JUST NOT. UNDER OUR SYSTEM AND WE DO NEED MORE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT ULTIMATELY SB FIFTY FOUR IS ABOUT IT'S ALSO WITH SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURAL PLAYS ARE ABOUT THEY WERE WORKING ON- BUT IN THE MEANTIME OUR CONSUMERS DESERVE TO KNOW. AND THIS IS WHAT SB THIRTY THREE FORTY THREE PROVIDE SOME WITH THAT DIED AT INFORMATION ABOUT RECYCLABILITY. SERVE WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES DISCUSSION.

COMMITTEE NIGHTMARE IS OVER NO MORE ALLEN BILLS AT LEAST UNTIL THE END- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR FORBEARANCE BECAUSE LET'S NOT TURN TO ARE PROBABLY GONNA GONZALEZ IS GOING TO PRESENT SB FOUR OH THREE ITEM FIVE IN YOUR CHEN IS MEMBERS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING TODAY S. B. FOUR OH THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE STATE WATER AUTHORITIES WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP CALIFORNIANS GET CLOSER TO REALIZING SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH PROVIDED THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER MANDATORY CONSOLIDATIONS FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER WELL THERE'S A THIRTY IS IMPORTANT IT'S THE STATE IN THE STATES S. H. AGAIN WATER EFFORTS IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY BEEN DONE TO THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY PROVIDING AND SAFE WATER WAITING UNTIL IT STRUGGLING WATER SYSTEM FAILS BEFORE TAKINGACTION DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO US BEFORE- THREE PROVIDES A PROACTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BY EXPANDING THE SB EIGHTY EIGHT CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY TO APPLY TO WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILING AND PLANNING AHEAD. FOR THAT OF FOR THAT CONSOLIDATION IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO SAFE WATER BECAUSE LARGER CONSOLIDATED SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY MORE RELIABLE SAFE AND EFFICIENT AND THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT 90% OF ALL DRINKING WATER VIOLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA OCCUR IN SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. MEMBERS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN OVERBURDENED WITH THE IMPACTS OF WATER CONTAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA I CERTAINLY KNOW THESE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND- IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES PAY SKY HIGH BILLS IN SOME CASES FOR BROWN WATER AND CAN NO LONGER ABIDE BY THE IN ACTION BY THE STATE WE MUST ACT NOW TESTIFYING AND IN SUPPORT TODAY. AND AS BEFORE- THREE THREE I HAVE MICHAEL CLAIBORNE THE DIRECTING ATTORNEY FOR LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND MUDDY YET LEAVE IT. UP AND BOARD MEMBER OF THE TOOL AVAILABLE TO ME JEWEL MANTRA WATER. CONSIDER YOUR WITNESSES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE I'M MICHAEL CLAIBORNE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ANY COACHELLA VALLEY. AT THE CORE OF PRE BUILT ON AT THE EIGHTY EIGHT AND TWENTY FIFTEEN AT EIGHT IN THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE WITH THE BURDEN OF CONTAMINATED TAP WATER DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE BOARD WOULD NOT HAVE ANY EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO GET STAKEHOLDERS AMPLE ROOM TO TALK ABOUT CONSOLIDATION IF THE SYSTEM HAS YET NOT YET FAILED. EVEN IF IT'S ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE THAT IT WILL FAIL. EVERY DAY I SEE FIRSTHAND THE CHALLENGES THAT SMALL WATER SYSTEMS CASE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND CLEAN WATER GLOWING. STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES INCLUDE DIFFICULTY WITH CANING IT AN ACTIVE FORD AND CERTIFIED OPERATOR INTERMITTENT WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS LACK OF BACKUP WATER SOURCES AND COURT COUNTY THE SCALE IN A LIMITED GREAT CARE BEARS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT FOR A WATER IN THE FAILED CAUSING FAMILIES TO LOSE ACCESS TO WATER AND THE STATE TO INEFFICIENTLY EXPEND PUBLIC FUNDS TO DELIVER BOTTLED WATER. INSTEAD THE STATE TO WORK PROACTIVELY ALONG FACT UNITY IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK AND ON THE CUSP OF FAILURE THIS BILL IMPORTANTLY REQUIRED MINIMUM MEANINGFUL CONSULTATION AND CONSIDERATION OF INPUT FROM THOSE SERVED BY THE AVERAGE WATER SYSTEM. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE- AND I'LL TURN THE TIME OVER TO MARIA TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE BILL AND- HILLARY COUNTY. AND HOW BURKE ME COULD BENEFIT FROM AS PEOPLE. FOUR OH THREE.

I THINK THAT THE ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. FOR A THREE. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE ARE MOVING IN THERE IS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION ANALYSIS SO LET'S BRING THE- WHAT'S BEING ADDED BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTION STOTTS- CENTER CASKEY. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE NATURAL NEXT STEP THAT WE TAKE IN REQUIRING ENFORCING THESE FEELING WATER DISTRICTS I DID TAKE A LOOK SECTION OF ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES. SAYING IT WAS AN EASY ISSUE AND IT WAS THE STATE CONTROL PROBLEM THIS IS THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE PUT AT THE FOOT. OF THE CULPRIT IN THE CITY'S LOCAL FEELING WATER DISTRICTS TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT FEES CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK ON NOT DOING VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS AND THIS IS WAS FORCED US TO COME UP WITH THIS MAN. I MEAN THE STATE HAS. KERN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD ENCOURAGING CONSOLIDATIONS HELPING OUT WHAT RESOURCES HELPING OUT WITH EDUCATING SOME OF THE FOLKS IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S WATER DISTRICT ANYMORE WHERE YOU COULD USE- ED. SELL WATER BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE HOOK UPS SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT ARE JUST CLEAR UP IN IN THE SECOND IS SAID WHO IS NOT COVERED THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE FIFTEEN UNITS FOR LESS ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE STATE AND I THINK. A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ADVOCATES THAT ARE ON THE LINE I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER SAFE DRINKING WATER TO EVERYBODY WE DON'T HAVE ANY JURISDICTION OVER THEM SOME OF THE WORST FEELING- SITUATIONS OR PEOPLE THAT RUN. WINTER TWELVE THE ROLE ON A WELL THEY THINK THEIR- DAD OR GRANDPA GERALD WELL WHAT ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE THESE NITRATES AND SOME NATURALLY OCCURRING CONTAMINANTS IS NOT NOBODY NO HUMAN BEING IS DONE ANYTHING SO. I APPLAUD. I MISS GONZALEZ BRINGING THIS INTO SITTING OKAY WE'VE BEEN NICE ON VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS NOW WE'RE GOING TO FORCE THESE CONSOLIDATIONS ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE FEEL FEELING AND WE HAD. A LOVELY CONVERSATION BY. THE OTHER MEMBERS HERE ABOUT TRUTH. IT IS BEING SENT OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THESE- OF CONTINUING PROBLEMS WERE THE STATE HAS TO BE TOWED WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE CAN AND THIS IS THE- CONSEQUENCE WOULD TELL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THIRTY DOLLARS. THE AIM IS TO RENT TOTALLY GET PROBLEM UNDERSTAND IT. M. TOO FAMILIAR WITH ACTUALLY COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH SO. WHO'S GONNA PAY SO WE DID. THE STATE PASSED SB EIGHTY EIGHT THEN WE SAW. THE THOSE TWO BOYS A PORTER BILL PORTER VILLE IN THE IN THE VALLEY THERE'S A HUGE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAD- SYSTEMS FAILING IN. CONTAMINATED WATER AND NO FUNDING NO A WEEK NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE PROP TO EIGHTEEN THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T THEY DON'T PASS FEES ON THEMSELVES TYPICALLY- SO THAT'S A BARRIER YUP LASKO CONCERNS ABOUT FORCING THEM INTO CONSOLIDATION. AND SO WHAT WE SAW WAS WE DID THE MONNING BILL. THE WAS IT LAST YEAR AND I KNOW THAT TO CENTER BY CAL SKI LOVED THAT BILL BECAUSE IT TOOK GREENHOUSE GAS MONIES IN FIXED A WATER PROBLEM. SO MY QUESTION IS A- IT IS HOW HOW I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXES OF THIS ISSUE. AND WHAT WHAT WHAT'S A MECHANISM TO ACTUALLY WHEN YOU FOR SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE EXPECTING THAT TO GET DONE AND CONSOLIDATE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE MAYBE ONE SYSTEM THAT IS. CAN IN CAN I READ I READ THROUGH THE ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT- YOU KNOW YOU BASICALLY ARE NOT ASKING THEM TO PUT UP ANY MORE MONEY YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A MERGE WITHOUT PUTTING MONEY UP BUT THERE'S A- HUGE DISCONNECT THERE BECAUSE- SOME OF THE SYSTEMS. NEED SUCH A LOT OF- FINANCES INVESTED IN THEM AND THEN YOU PUT A BURDEN ON A SYSTEM THAT IS IN IT SO YOU'RE TAXING SOMEBODY WHO IS. NOT GETTING THE BENEFIT FROM THE WHICH THEN BECOMES A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO I JUST WANTED IT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ON. HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY PLAY OUT AND B. B. BURKE. AT THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY AND I THINK- THIS IS THESE ARE THE FEW STEPS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE CONSOLIDATION AND AS MENTIONED BY SENATOR MAKOWSKI THERE'S A VOLUNTARY. CALLED CONSOLIDATION THAT COULD BE AN OPTION. PARTIAL MERGERS IT'S NOT A FULL MERGER YOU KNOW. THERE'S DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD BE DONE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE FOLKS ARE NOT RECEIVING. AS YOU MENTIONED. CLEAN WATER FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE PAYING AN ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THAT AREN'T GETTING THAT I MEAN TO BE ABLE TO. PRINT POTENTIALLY MERGE WITHOUT THE STATE OR EVEN JUST GETTING A LETTER FROM THE STATE OR- YOU KNOW BY SAYING THIS IS A SUGGESTION FOR YOU TO CONSOLIDATE- AND YOUR WITHIN THREE MILES OF. A GOAL GOOD PERFORMING- THAT COMPANY I THINK WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AGAIN THE BETTERMENT OF THE- OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL SIR- AND WE DON'T. ALSO WANT TO TAP INTO THE SB TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU DON'T NEED TO. IT AND THAT'S A HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS I THINK PER YEAR. SO I'M YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO JUST PROVIDE THESE PREVENTION MECHANISMS IS HARM PREVENTION MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO. ALLOW FOLKS TO AGAIN. COME UP WITH THEIR OWN PLAN- BEFORE WE GET INVOLVED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE STATE WATER BOARD IS ALSO FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY FAILING. AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW I MEAN THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE ON OUR RADAR BUT- ONE OTHER THING THAT WE CAN DO TO JUST AT LEAST PUT ON OUR RADAR AND- HOPEFULLY. GET THOSE FOLKS TO DO IT ON ON THEIR OWN. WELL WE HAVE IT UNDER SB EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAVEN'T BEEN. SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THEM TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN AND BECAUSE IT BOILS DOWN TO THOSE THREE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS. UP TO EIGHTEEN LASKO AND THEN FINANCING AND THOSE ARE THE TO THE- TRUST ME THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO IT BUT THEY CAN'T. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT. N. A. IT WE CAN WE CAN PASS A MANDATE ON TO THEM BUT A MANDATE IS SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AND THEN THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO VEHICLE. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THE RATE. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL. YEAH IT'S JUST A CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT A MANDATE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS RIGHT NOW I MEAN WE NEED THE DATA AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WHERE THESE AT RISK FAILING SYSTEMS ARE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU I MEAN IT I MEAN THEY'RE ON THE CUSP OF FEELING BECAUSE THEY HAVE VARIOUS INDICATORS. WHICH ARE BEING ASSESSED RIGHT NOW BY THE WATER BOARD. AS YOU KNOW POOR GOVERNANCE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESERVES FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. PRESENCE OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONTAMINANTS I MEAN IS A REALLY SEVERE ISSUES THAT WE CAN'T WAIT YOU KNOW TO JUST ONE DAY. FIGURE OUT WE HAVE TO ACT AT LEAST HAVE THE MONEY ON OUR RADAR- SO LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT I JUST. YOU KNOW WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING IS THERE. IS THERE CAPITAL. SIZE OF WATER SYSTEMS. NO THERE IS NO CAP IT JUST IT FALLS IN LINE WITH SB EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY AT THE CENTER AND. FIVE CETERA CASKEY OVERLOOK THE MOVE THE BILL I. WITH THE BILL AND- GIVE A CLOSER JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN DO- COULD WORK FOR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED SAFE DRINKING WATER AND I THINK YOU- ALL THE- STAKEHOLDERS WHO CALLED IN TODAY. THANK YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY CENTER CALCULATES- CONSULT WITH FEDERAL. I DON'T NUMBER FIVE SB FOUR ORDER THREE BY ENATOR GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE ALLEN. BY ALLEN AYE BATES NOT VOTING. IT'S NOT VOTING DALY NOPE DALLY NO GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ IF YOU MIKE ON TIE LAWS HI SKINNER STERN BY CASKEY BY AYE CASKEY AYE. OKAY SO THAT IS WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT OPEN FOR CENTER STERN TO FINISH TURNS GOING TO SKINNER THAT ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER LET'S NOW GO TO ITEM NUMBER SIX THE SENATE RECOUNT SKIS. SB THIRTY EIGHT VERY- NO SIMPLE BILL. AFTER ALL THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND TRUTHFULNESS IN TAKING POWER AWAY FROM CAL RECYCLE AND CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE AND ALL THESE IN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD I DO I. AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TO PERCENT- SB THIRTY EIGHT AND FIRST I WANT EXCEPT START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IS OUTLINED IN THE- IN THE STAFF REPORT AND THEN TO CONSULTANT FOR HER WORK- WITH MY OFFICE ON THE ANALYSIS THIS YEAR. TWO YEARS AGO AND FOUR YEARS AGO- SB THIRTY EIGHT IS AS THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES A COMPREHENSIVE BOTTLE BILL REFORM THE CALIFORNIA HAS NEEDED FOR YEARS AND IT FIXES ARE ANTIQUATED BEVERAGE CONTAINER REDEMPTION RECYCLING PROGRAM. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW STREAMLINED STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM THE PLACE IS REDEMPTION AND RECYCLING RESPONSIBILITIES ON THOSE. WHO DISTRIBUTE THE BEVERAGES INSIDE CALIFORNIA IT'S A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY YOU CREATE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER YOU'RE GOING TO RUN THE ROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO SHRINK DOWN CAL RECYCLE IS THINK THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES THE- STATE OF OREGON HAS ONE PERSON WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT DOES READ- RECYCLING. THIS BILL IS SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION THAT I'VE INTRODUCED BEFORE AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AS IT GOES FORWARD AS I HAVE FOR FOUR YEARS. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO. PROPOSE TO. REDUCE BACK IN. RESEARCH EFFICIENCIES AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED REDUCING CONTAMINATION- UNLIKE MY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THOUGH S. B- THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT EXPAND THE CONTAINERS COVERED IN THE PROGRAM I'VE LISTENED TO MANY MEMBERS THAT WERE UNWILLING TO VOTE FOR A BILL THAT DIDN'T EXPANSION SO WE HAVE WE'RE NOT. AT THIS TIME SEEKING TO EXPAND THE COVERAGE IT IS MODELED AS I INDICATED QUITE A BIT AFTER THE OREGON PROGRAM IT'S A PROGRAM THAT I AND OTHER MEMBERS HAD VISITED MEETING WITH THEIR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP LEADERS THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AND SEEING HOW THE RETENTION THEIR BOTTLE. DEPOSIT A BILL WORKS HERE DECADES AGO OR ONCE UPON A TIME I GUESS IS MORE APPROPRIATE THE BOTTLE BILL WAS THE IMPETUS OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL LEADERSHIP RECYCLING THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE- I KNOW. CONSUMER WATCHDOG WHO WERE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM HAS PRODUCED A REPORT ENTITLED TRASH THE CAME OUT LAST YEAR HOW CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING FAILED AND HOW TO FIX IT- YOU KNOW WE- WHAT WE HAD. SIX IN PREVENTING BILLIONS OF BOTTLES AND CANS FROM BEING- TURNED IN INTO LITTER OR TO GO TO LANDFILLS BUT- SAID I'M HERE MISTER CHURCH WITH YOU AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SAY WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER. MANY OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS OF BOTTLES AND CANS HAVE SAVED ENERGY HAVE SAFE WATER RESOURCES. BUT AFTER STE THIRTY YEARS AND OVER SEVENTY FIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THE STRUCTURE NO LONGER REFLECTS OUR NEED TO MEET OUR GOAL. AS INSURE THE CHEER- HERE'S OUR GIRL GOAL FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THE REFORMS LAID OUT IN SB THIRTY EIGHT OR BASED ON THREE SIMPLE PRINCIPLES. ONE IS SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WE'RE GOING TO THE PRODUCERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- THERE AT THE TABLE AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER PARTNERS. SECOND CONSUMER. CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER CONVENIENCE THAT WE HAVE AND THIRD IMPROVING THE RECYCLING WRITTEN. REMANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES. SB THIRTY TO CREATE A THIRTY EIGHT. ANOTHER THIRTY TWO DOES FOR THIRTY EIGHT CREATES A STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM RUN BY THE DISTRIBUTORS AND LARGE PRODUCERS THAT DISTRIBUTOR ON PRODUCTS. THEY WOULD CRAFTED PROGRAM STRUCTURE WITH INPUT FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE'RE LETTING THE PRIVATE BUSINESS CREATE THE PROGRAM. THIS TRANSITION TO A STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM IN SB THIRTY EIGHT DOES LIMIT CAL RECYCLES. ROLE BUT IT DOES NOT. IT EVENT LIVE TO OVERSIGHT AND IF OF. THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS TOOK AS MANY YEARS TO GET HERE THE SOLUTION OTHER STATES AND OTHER NATIONS. I HAVE- HAVE TAKEN HAVE OF MUCH HIGHER RETENTION RATES THE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER I HAVE WITNESSES IN LINE TO TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT MISTER I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. MY WITH MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR WITNESSES ARE JAMIE COURT FROM CONSUMER WATCHDOG AND JEFF DUNN JEFF DONLEVY FROM- MING'S RECYCLING CORPORATION SACRAMENTO. AT LEAST THOSE TWO AND ALSO ST PETERS FROM THE SEVEN YEAH SORT OF SURPRISING OKAY SO LET'S LET'S TURN TO DO YOUR YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO. A MODERATOR DO WE HAVE- WE HAVE THOSE FOLKS READY ON THE ON THE LINE SO WHATEVER G. ME W. IN ALL THE LAND OPENNESS. I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR YOU. ALL THE LINES ARE OPEN THERE. MR MAKE ME LEAVE ME WITH THEIR CONSUMER WATCHDOG GREAT YEAH THIS IS JAMIE FROM CONSUMER WATCHDOG CAN YOU HEAR ME STATURE WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. OKAY GREAT THANKS SO MUCH THANK DECEMBER WHITE HOUSE YOU FOR SUPPORTING SB THIRTY EIGHT AND- INTRODUCING IT. YOU KNOW COULD BE CALIFORNIA'S- REDEMPTION RIGHT THIS IS THE RATE AT WHICH CONSUMERS GET THEIR DEPOSIT BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE THE NUMBERS. FROM POWER CYCLE IT IS A 50% REDEMPTION RATE. THAT IS- BUT IF YOU TAKE THE RECYCLING RATE IS 60% TAKE UP 210% CLICK GOES TO CURBSIDE OUR RETENTION RATE IS 58% AND THAT IS THE THIRD WORST. AMONG BOTTLE DEPOSITS IN THE- AMERICA WE ARE PROMISED AN GETTING BETTER. THE REASON IS REDEMPTION CENTERS OF CLOSE IN RECORD NUMBERS RETAILERS GROCERS THEY'RE NOT TAKING BACK AND SEEMS. MORE GROCERS ARE OPTING OUT THEY CAN PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY AN OPT OUT 75% OF WHOLE FOOD SOURCES OF THE GREEN GROCER WHOLE FOODS HAVE OPTED OUT OF RECEIVING BOTTLES AND CANS. AND SO WITH NO PLACE LEFT TO TURN COAL TUMORS STROKE THE CANS AND- BOTTLES IN THE KERBSIDE AND AT LEAST ONE IN FOUR OF THOSE. END UP IN LANDFILL BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTAMINATED BY THE SINGLE STREAM LOANS. SB THIRTY EIGHT RINGS CALIFORNIA INTO LINE WITH. EVERY OTHER SUCCESSFUL BOTTLE DEPOSIT PROGRAM AMERICAN THE WORLD. AND CHARGING INDUSTRY. AS OPERATOR. AND POPPING THE PODS. UP UPPING THE- FIVE TEN CENTS. YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO HAVE A HIGHER REDEMPTION RATES THIS IS WHAT YOU EVERY ELSE WE CAN MAKE. YEAH BOTTLE DEPOSIT PROGRAM IN A- POSSIBLE IN AB PER RETENTION RATE WHICH IS A THE GOAL IN THIS THIRTY IS YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER STATES. WITH SIMILAR- X. PRODUCERS. OFFICE THEY HAVE THESE RATES MISTER IN PER ARE AGAIN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. MILLION 84% PER MONTH SEVENTY ONE PERCENT. WE JUST NEED THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT HAVE TAKEN THIS PROGRAM FOR RIDE FOR TOO LONG AND TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM INTO. ONE THAT IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER. AND THE ENVIRONMENT. BY ENDING. CURBING CRIME CHANGE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE CO V. ONE WE IT. IT'S NOT A TAX BECAUSE THERE IS YOU CAN. WAY TO IT BACK. AND AND THEIR- NO GOING BACK NOW BECAUSE OF THE- DECIMATING THE RID. SENT AND THE- NOT WILL TO STEP UP BUT THEY DO THE LEGAL RESPONSE. WE NEED TO WE NEED AN OVERHAUL AND SB THIRTY EIGHT IS THAT OVERALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COURT. THE MORNING CHAIRMAN ALAN MY NAME IS JEFF DONLEVY GENERAL MANAGER OF MEANS RESOURCES THE SPECS HERE TO SUPPORT SB THIRTY EIGHT THE MAJOR REFORM THE CONSUMERS DISCOVER CREATES JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU STRATEGICAL CREEKS IN THE BOTTLE BILL WILL NOT HELP US THINGS WILL ONLY GET WORSE WE CAN DEFINITELY DO BETTER THINGS WILL SOUND BINDING LONG WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM VIETNAM IN THE OPEN WHAT IS TODAY THE OLDEST. CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTER IN SACRAMENTO. FOR WE SEEM TOO MANY YEARS. CENTERS CLOSE. IN OTHER RECYCLING CENTERS WILL SUPPORT LEGISLATION. THAT HELPS IMPROVE THE PROGRAM FOR CONSUMERS AND SUPPORTS. OLD MINERS HIKING CENTERS. BEING INSISTENCE DISAPPEARED FROM MANY COMMUNITIES THE GROWING CONTAMINATION CURBSIDE MATERIAL AS A RESULT OF THE MATERIAL BEING SHIPPED OUT OF STATE AND TAKING OBS WITH IT. YOUR EQUALITY FROM RECYCLING CENTERS CREATES INVESTMENT IN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVING A STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION LED BY THE DISTRIBUTORS WILL BRING THEIR EXPERTISE IN LOGISTICS TO HELP SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THE PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THE NEW ORGANIZATION BRINGS TOGETHER THE SUPERTEAM OF DISTRIBUTORS MANUFACTURERS GROCERS AND RECYCLING CENTERS. TO MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO REDEEM THEIR C. R. V. DEPOSIT. I LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MOTION FORWARD. AND FOR THESE REASONS I URGE A YES VOTE ON SB THIRTY EIGHT.

THANK YOU ONE MOMENT SIR MY NUMBER ELEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. PLEASE PROCEED BY- STEVEN MYERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IN OPPOSITION MAN THAT. RATHER THAN PUTTING BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS IN CHARGE OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING WE BELIEVE THE BETTER PATH FORWARD IS TO MAKE A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIFIC UPDATES TO THE PROGRAM. INCLUDING GIVING POWER CYCLE MORE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW FLEXIBLE RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS. THE LOCAL COURTS STAND READY TO ASSIST IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS THAT MAKE RECYCLING MORE CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE BILL'S PROVISIONS AND THE LOCAL COURTS PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS. SO WE ARE EAGER TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND A RESOLUTION THAT PROTECTS THE CORE. AND INCREASES RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. LINE NUMBER EIGHTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- WE ARE IT IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTY EIGHT- CERTAINLY THE BOTTLE AND CAN RECYCLING LAWS IN NEED OF ATTENTION BUT THE ATTENTION THAT IS NEEDED IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC. IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD AND IT'S VERY AFFORDABLE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXISTING PROGRAM- OR OF S. THIRTY EIGHT IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE FIX IT SIMPLY SHIFTING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE IT SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OPERATING IN OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM FROM CAL RECYCLE WHO HANDLES ALL OF THE RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA TO THE BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY WE THINK BUT THEY WERE POORLY EQUIPPED TO RUN A COMPREHENSIVE RECYCLING PROGRAM AND THERE'S NOTHING. IN SB THIRTY EIGHT BUT DEFINES WHAT THAT PROGRAM WOULD LOOK LIKE- THERE IS- THAT THE SUPPORTERS HAVE MADE REFERENCE TO THE OREGON BOTTLE AND CAN RECYCLING PROGRAM. BUT UNTIL OR INCREASE THEIR REAP VALUE. CONTENT CALIFORNIA HAD A BETTER RECYCLING RATES IN OREGON FOR MORE THAN A DECADE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A BETTER RECYCLING RATES IN OREGON AND EVEN TODAY RIGHT NOW TODAY LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THE ENTIRE- SAM JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS A BETTER RECYCLING RATE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IN OREGON. SO. BY NUMBER FORTY FOUR DEADLINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

IF HE IF THIS WAS ACTUALLY TO GET SIGNED INTO LAW WITH THE TRANSITION OF LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE- EXISTING. THE F. T. E.'S IT EKOW RECYCLE. IN THE MONEY FLOW. ALL ALL THE MONEY WOULD GO TO THE- THE DISTRIBUTORS AND THE BEVERAGE CONSISTS SYSTEM RICHER PROGRAM THAT'S THAT SET UP SO THEY THEY COLLECTED CALIFORNIA'S WOULD WOULD HAVE TO RETOOL R. I. CAL RECYCLE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO CAL RECYCLE DOES FOR LIKE WILDFIRES WHEN THEY COME UP AND WE GET TO COURT PROGRAM AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE RUNNING THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM WILL BE RUN BY IT'S AN INDEPENDENT STEWARDSHIP CAMILLUS BE FRANK. DISTRIBUTOR AND WASTE HAULERS ARE NOT GONNA BE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM IS COULD BE AN INDEPENDENT- PROGRAM THIS COULD BE. DESIGNED BY THEM AND WE'RE LETTING PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO DESIGN IT SO I SEE THOSE PEOPLE. MOVING TO DIFFERENT TASK WITHI CAL RECYCLES OR EARLY RETIREMENT SHOULD THINGS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT BUT THE IDEA IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A REPORT AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROGRAM. IS GOING TO BE THE LIMITED ROLE THAT CAL RECYCLE WILL PLAY AT LEAST IN THE BOTTLE. INDUSTRY THERE HAVE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES BUT THIS IS IN THE BOTTLE. SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE HOW DOES THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW DISTRICT STE DISTRIBUTOR RUN BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. HELP CONSTITUENTS AND THEN ROLL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE- AND HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET THE RESEARCH DATA OR THEIR MONEY BACK AND WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES AS IT IS. HAVING PLACES TO TAKE KERR SAID SO WHAT WHAT WE ENVISION IS THAT THIS THIS PROGRAM WOULD COME WOULD GO LIVE IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THERE'S A COUPLE. COUPLE OF SECTIONS THAT GO ON IS SAID HE SAID ASSUMING THE BILL GETS ENACTED GETS APPROVED. THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEMAND THAT. THE BUDGETS SUBCOMMITTEE WHO'S IN CHARGE OF RECYCLING IS GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY OUT FOR THESE HAULERS AND FOR THE- THIRD. I RECYCLER SAID WE'VE HAD SOME IN. WILL REMAIN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURES IMPLODING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY WILL BE SOMEBODY'S REVERSE VENDING MACHINES WHICH WILL GO OUT FOR EARLY ADOPTERS THAT. DID I WOULD IMAGINE GROCERY STORES AND OTHER AREAS. FOR THE RURAL CALIFORNIA I THINK WHICH GET WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO. FRONT LOAD SOMEBODY'S- THE DEPOSIT SITES THIS COULD BE A DROP OF. AT A DROP FORTUNE THAT. I'M SURE WILL. BECOME FULL FLEDGED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT IN THE INTERIM. I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW I'M I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING. WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTING- RECYCLED MATERIALS NOW SO THAT THEY CAN STAY THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS AND THEN AGAIN I. I'M NOT MAKING THE DECISIONS HERE IS GOING TO BE THE- THE COOPERATIVE THAT'S PUT TOGETHER- FOR WHO WHO THEY'RE GONNA HIRE BUT I WANT TO HAVE AS MANY PLAYERS. AVAILABLE THAT THE BETTER PART OF THE- ECOSYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS RECYCLING. IN MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE WHY VOTE TO MORE ACTUALLY THE SO LAST YEAR WE DID AB SEVENTY NINE THREE TEAM WHICH- WAS SIGNED INTO LAW CREATED THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT RATE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WHICH IS 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY HOW DOES THIS BILL INTERACT WOULD INTERACT WITH THOSE PENALTIES. THAT WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE MEETING THOSE OBLIGATIONS OF SEVEN NINE THREE. WELL THIS WILL HOPEFULLY WILL HELP TO BECAUSE THE WEATHER YOU'RE A GLASS BURBANK. REMANUFACTURING OR PLASTIC REMANUFACTURING THEY NEED SOME PRODUCT MEAN THAT THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE WITH THE BLUES PEOPLE AND APPLYING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO SCRAPE TOGETHER THE RAW MATERIAL TO COLLECT IT IS BEING RECYCLED AND I'M CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THOSE FOLKS SO. IT'S AMERICA'S ME YOU REMEMBER SB ONE SIXTY EIGHT THAT I HAD TO FOUR YEARS AGO THAT THAT WAS THE PRECURSOR THAT THAT WAS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE THE ONE OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY GET BECAME A CONTENT BILL THE ASSEMBLY pSTAFF REPORT. THEY REJECTED IT AND MISTER KING TOOK IT IN A CAN INCORPORATE INTO AN ASSEMBLY BILL HAS THAT IS OFTEN HAPPENS IN THIS AREA- SO THAT WILL. BE THE MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING MORE CLEAN PRODUCT ANY IDEA WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONTAMINATION NO ONE OF THE CAN CONTAMINATION BE MAYONNAISE THE CONTAMINATION OF PEACHES. OTHER TYPES OF GLASS PRODUCTS IN THIS REALLY TAKES OUT ALTER REALLY VALUABLE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE FOR- SPORTS BOTTLES AND WHATEVER AND PUTS HIM SEPARATES. THEM INTO A- STREAMED CAN BE RE. AND MAKES THAT APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO MEET THE- MINIMUM REQUIREMENT THROUGHOUT THE DECADE. OKAY MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE DOES SB THIRTY EIGHT HAVE ANY. MECHANISM TO PREVENT AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD FROM OTHER STATES COMING IN ABSOLUTELY SEE WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE DO BUT WE MEASURE- THE RE DEPOSIT BY WEIGHT AND YOU KNOW WHAT CALIFORNIA'S GONNA HAVE TO LEARN NOT TO SMASH THEIR PLASTIC BOTTLES AND SMASH THE CANS. BUT WE COULD HAVE A BAR COURT CODE ON IT SO WHEN IT GOES TO THE SMITH THESE MACHINE THAT READS IT WHETHER IT'S A REVERSE VENDING MACHINE- IS TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE ONE OF THE- OF FACILITIES TO TAKE IT IT WILL READ THAT BAR CODES WILL KNOW EXACTLY. WHO'S WHO'S- BOTTLES AND CANS AND CONTAINERS ARE BEING RECYCLED WHO ARE TOO SO THERE'S GONNA BE NO FRAUD ISN'T THIS THIS GUY- COOPERATIVE ONCE IT'S SET UP THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHUT THAT DOWN BECAUSE THE MACHINES GET REJECTED IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE IT. IS ARCHITECTED THE BIT SO THIS IDEA OF TRUCKLOADS OF CANS FROM COLORADO COMING IN HERE IS GOING TO BE DONE BECAUSE WE'RE ONE YOU CAN'T SMASH IT YOU GOT TO READ THAT BAR CODE AND TWO TICKET YOU KNOW IT'S WHATEVER. I'M NOT A TECH GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY WITH THE BAR CODE BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT SO THEY SAY OH THIS IS PART OF THE THEN IN CALIFORNIA SO. IT'S ONE OF. THE EXTRA BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM. THIRTY DOLLARS. S. THANK YOU CENTER CASKET NOW YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS FOR FAR TOO LONG SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK BUT- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT MENTIONS ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS- WITH. EIGHTY ONE I'M SORRY I'M PAID FOR ON PAGE TWENTY. ON WHETHER THEY WOULD BE PERMITTED AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THEN ALSO WHAT TYPES OF PAYMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IMMEDIATE. THE FIRST TWO BULLET POINTS- WELL I MEAN I ANTICIPATE THAT MOST OF THIS IS GONNA BE ELECTRONIC- TRANSFER IS WHEN WE SEE IMMEDIATE THIS IS GOING TO MAKE A CALCULATION AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT THAT'S GONNA BE SIX SET UP THROUGH YOUR BANK OR THROUGH YOUR CHURCH OR THROUGH YOUR SCHOOL OR AND YOU COULD GET. AN AUTOMATIC I MEAN I SEE IMMEDIATE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW HOW QUICKLY HE'S GONNA GET IN BUT BUT- IT'S GOING TO BE A CALCULATION THAT'S GOING TO BE GONE AT ELECTRONICALLY THROUGH OUR- BACK. ALL THAT ONE CASH. AND THOSE THINGS THAT THAT CASH IS STILL GOING TO BE AVAILABLE I THINK THAT AGAIN WE'RE GONNA LET THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM RUN IT AND SET IT UP. BUT I THINK THAT THAT THAT CASH IS STILL KING IN CALIFORNIA. SO SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANT IT. WAS DEFINITELY THANK YOU. OKAY. ZERO BUT WE SHOULD ALL DO WITH THE COMMITTEE TRIP UP THROUGH CENTER DOLLARS DISTRICT AND- OF IT GO OVER THE BORDER AND OREGON AND SEE THE PROGRAM THERE I'VE I'VE GOT A CHANCE TO SEE IT IN THEM. AND YOU KNOW UP IN PORTLAND WITH A PORTION OF THE STATEMENTS IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE SO- NO YOU'RE YOU'RE A COURSE. T. SAID THAT WE CAN COORDINATE A LITTLE HELP ON THE ON THE OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO GAME. THE SYSTEM BY TRACK YOU ACROSS THE BORDER. IT WAS WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES BUT- THE THIRD THIS TURNER WITH THOUSAND ISLAND MOVIE ADAM OKAY GREAT SO THE MOVED SEVENTY DOLLARS IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER CASKEY. IT'S I'D LIKE TO BORROW FROM THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG'S EXECUTIVE SUMMARY- THAT THEY CAME UP WITH WHAT TRAVIS AND YOU KNOW RETENTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CLOSING AND OF ALARMING RATE WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN CUT IN HALF THE CABINET. AND HAVE BEEN BASICALLY CONSUMERS TODAY ARE GETTING ABOUT HALF OF THE NICKELS AND DIMES IS DEPOSIT THE TICKET FEE THEY PAY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND THEY GET BACK ABOUT HALF OF THAT IN UNDER THIS BILL IT WILL CHANGE. AND THAT THE TAPE HE PAID TIME YOU COULD GET THAT TIME BACK IN THE AND THE PD PEOPLE TO PRODUCE THE BOTTLES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. AND THEN WE KNOW THAT CAL RECYCLE HAZARD A LOT OF UNCLAIMED DEPOSITS RIGHT NOW THAT THEY CAN USE AND WILL WORK OUT WITH THAT ON THE BUDGET SIDE BUT ONCE WE NEED A SYSTEM. SET UP SENATE SOMETHING THE CALIFORNIA BE PROUD ABOUT AND WILL READ CAME OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN RECYCLING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AND AYE KHORCHIN AYE VOTE. SENATOR KADAMBAS COLOR. I THE NUMBERS SIX SB THIRTY BY SENATOR WERE CAST THE MOTION IS PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN I BATES. DALLY WROTE DALY NO GONZALEZ HI. DOLLARS BY D. RESPECTFULLY KNOWING I HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THOSE BATES SNOW RESPECTFUL RECKLESS PLEASE NOTE SKINNER STERN Y. CASKEY HI CASKEY I. PART YEAH WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN- THANK YOU MEMBERS OKAY LET'S NOW TURN TO THE LONG. THE LONG SUFFERING- CENTER PORTANTINO. TO PRESENT HIS BILL THIS IS A SB TWO THIRTY FIVE AND SEVEN YEAR JANICE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY PRESENTING SB TWO THIRTY TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY THE STATE WIDE CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN ONGOING DEDICATED CVC PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OCCURRENCE IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN OR CEC'S ARE THEY AS THEY ARE KNOWN. OUR DIVERSE GROUP OF SYNTHETIC OR NATURALLY OCCURRING CHEMICALS OR MICRO ORGANISMS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGULATED IN DRINKING WATER SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED NEW WAYS TO DETECT CECE'S IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS IT USED TO BE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MEASURING CHEMICALS IN PARTS PER MILLION THAN PARTS PER BILLION AND NOW WE CAN TO DETECT DOWN TO PARTS PER TRILLION. GIVEN THIS CAPABILITY SCIENTISTS WILL CONTINUE TO DETECT NEW UNREGULATED CC'S THAT COULD INCLUDE PHARMACEUTICALS PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS OUR INVESTOR CALL INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS IN TRACE AMOUNTS. SB TWO THIRTY IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE STATE WATER BOARD GATHER INFORMATION UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK OF THE CDC'S AND THEIR OCCURRENCE IN DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE STATE WATER BOARD MAKE INFORMED SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THEM FOR REGULATION. THE BILL REQUIRES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CREATE A SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL MADE UP OF EXPERTS TO ADVISE THEM ON CEC'S AND CREATES IN THE STATE TREASURY SEC ACTION FUND. WHICH UPON APPROPRIATION WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD TO SUPPORT PROGRAM I UNDERSTAND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL FOR SEVERAL SEVERAL MONTHS BUT THE NGO STILL HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THOSE THOSE ARE IN NEED THOSE ARE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED WON'T SLOW DOWN THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT THE BILL WOULD EXCLUDE THE PAPHOS CHEMICAL FROM THE DEFINITION OF CEC'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY AT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO STUDY AND MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO REGULATE. THOSE CHEMICALS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR MEETING WITH THE WATER AGENCIES THIS WE EIGHT MILE. IS TO SEE IF WE COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS I'VE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO LEARN THAT THE AGENCIES HAVE AGREED TO EXCLUDE P. FOX FROM THE BILL. AND THEY PLAN TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE NGOS ON LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT DELAYS IN REGULATING SPECIES THAT POSE A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THINGS WORK OUT I'M- I THINK REMOVING P. FOSSE WAS A GOOD STEP FORWARD I KNOW THE CHAIR CONCURS WITH THAT ANALYSIS. AND HOPEFULLY THAT SHOULD SINCE WE'VE PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED MOST OF THE CONCERNS HOPEFULLY- WITHDRAW SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM. THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED. ON THE PHONE TDAY WE HAVE DANIELLE BLASTED HAYDEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATIONS AND KATHY. BATALHA WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I JUST AND JUST TO CLARIFY IT SO IT'S MINES SO THERE'S THE P. FUSS. I EXCLUSION THE ISSUE OF LANGUAGE TO LIMIT UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER BIG ISSUE OF COURSE WAS INCLUDING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ENSURE THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL. ARE TRULY INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM CONFLICTS AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE WORKING ON ON THE ISLAND ON A TWO YEAR OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CHáVEZ. MR AND CENTER PORTANTINO SO LET'S LET'S NOW GO TO YOUR- THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. OKAY GREAT- MY NAME IS DANIELLE BLASTED HAYDN AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PLEASED TO COSPONSOR SB TWO THIRTY AND THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE SENATOR NOTED DETECTION METHOD RECEIVE THESE CONTINUE JUNKER AND SCIENTISTS CAN NOW IDENTIFY THOUSANDS OF THEM AND BRING WATER SOURCES IN THE PARTS PER TRILLION. IT'S HARD TO WHAT TO TACKLE FOR AND RIGHT NOW. THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO ESTABLISH DRINKING WATER STANDARD CONSIDERED CONTAMINANTS ONE BY ONE. INSTEAD OF CONTINUING WITH WITH A SCATTERSHOT APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE CT YOUR DIRECTOR REGULATE SB TWO THIRTY WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM RECEIVED THESE AND DRINKING WATER AT THE STATE WATER BOARD. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDING THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL WHAT IDENTIFY EVALUATE AND PRIORITIZE FOR ACTION HE'D BE THE DRINKING WATER SOURCES. AND IF NEEDED PROACTIVELY FILL INFORMATION GAPS. THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION IN THE PROGRAM IS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE EFFORTS ON FECES AND PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY TO CALIFORNIANS THAT WATER AGENCIES. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO DELAY OR OTHERWISE CIRCUMVENT THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR ANY ACTION ON DEC. WATER AGENCIES UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF DRINKING WATER THAT IS SAFE AND RELIABLE AND ARE COMMITTED. TO ENSURING CALIFORNIANS. COMP IN THEIR WATER SUPPLY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THE STATE THAT CANCER THAT ARE. THEIR AFTER AND THE OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE CHAIR WE WILL OUR IN CENTERPOINT COMMITMENT YOU COULD IF YOU FAST CLASS OF CHEMICALS FROM THE BILL AND ADD LANGUAGE RELATED TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT GOOD FIRST STEP. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION. WE ARE YOUR AYE VOTE. WE LOST OUR CHAIR FOR REMAIN HERE GOOD MORNING GOOD FOR THE NEXT ONE. YEAH THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THIS IS KATHY BEALE CAN'T BE A TELECOMMUTING.

STAFF AT OUR WATER QUALITY LAB AND TRY DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANTS WORK DILIGENTLY TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMERS. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE ON EMERGING QUALITY CONCERNS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE TOPIC THE METROPOLITAN'S BOARD AND URBAN WATER AGENCIES ARE FOCUSED ON FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE SENATOR. THE APPROACH AND SB TWO THIRTY AT THE WATER COMMUNITY SOLUTION TO HELP THE STATE'S MOST FASTER TO ADDRESS NEW. EMERGING CONTAMINANTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGULATED. THE LEGISLATION IS MEANT TO PROVIDE THE STATE WATER BOARD ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS HE'S TO HELP THEM PRIORITIZE. A PROACTIVELY DEAL WITH G. EAZY THAT THEY ARE DETECTED. THAT WOULD SUPPORT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON THE RISKS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND OCCURRENCE. WHEN THE NEW THESES ARE DETECTED THE STATE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONES TO PRIORITIZE FOR FURTHER ACTION. I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIR AND STAFF AND SENATOR PORTANTINO AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FOR MEETING WITH US AND TALKING THROUGH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AS DESCRIBED. BY SENATOR ALLEN EARLIER OF MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT WE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE LEGISLATION AND COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS.

HI THERE THIS IS ACTUALLY OUT OF THE CAR FROM RV OKAY- I'M DOING THE SPEAKING YES THANK YOU. I COULD AGAIN THOUSAND STARTED TOP GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AVINASH KAR I'M A SENIOR. AND DIRECTOR FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. HE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING ON TOPICS AND TOXINS IN YOUR WATER. I WANT TO START BY TAKING THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PORTANTINO AND THE SPONSORS FOR ENGAGING WITH OUR CONCERNS. WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND A COMMITMENT TO EXCLUDE THE CLASS OF BEHALF CHEMICALS IN THE AND THAT OF SAID SB TWO THIRTY. AND TO ENSURE THAT ANYBODY CONVENE AND THIS BILL IS TRULY INDEPENDENT. AND CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WELL WE REMAIN FORMALLY OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL MOVING. FORWARD WILL BE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO. LANGUAGE TO. THAT WE CAN COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE SPONSORS AND AUTHOR. AS WELL AS CONTINUING PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TIMELINE TO ENSURE THAT ONE BUT BILL TO THEM FOR THE SLOW DOWN THE ALREADY SLOW PROCESS. OF REGULATING HARMFUL CHEMICALS IN DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO THAT ANY SCIENTIFIC PANEL CAN BE INTO STRUCTURED TO BEST HELP THE WATER BOARD- YES OUR TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS THAT IS NOT ALREADY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. YOU. LET'S GO TO ANDREA. MODERATORS ENTER THEIR- YOUR LINE IS OPEN MA'AM. I'M SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOU LANDLER. OKAY I'M SORRY MIGHT MY PROP MY FAULT ON MY PHONE PHOTO- GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS ANDREA EVAN TURNER I FIND THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I ALSO HAD OUR TOXICS PROGRAM. AND ARE YOU ALSO WANT TO START BY APPLAUDING THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICES AND SPONSORS- OVER THIS BILL. FOR THE PAST YEAR IN THE HOPE OF COMING TO AGREEMENT WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS EFFORTS IN RECENT DAYS ON THE P. FATS ISSUE. WHICH WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TO US- HOWEVER I HAVE WORKED ON DRINKING WATER STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. AND BASED ON THAT LONG EXPERIENCE- WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW AT THIS TIME TO SUPPORT THE BILL. DESPITE WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IN FACT ITS GOOD INTENTIONS. BUT TWENTY WATER. PROGRAM I'M IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST SCIENTIFICALLY ROBUST IN THE NATION. IN ADDITION THE STATE BOARD ALREADY HAS THE CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN. PROGRAMS WITHIN THE RECYCLED WATER PROGRAM. AND THAT ALREADY IS LOOKING AT DRINKING WATER GIVEN THE STATE'S GOALS AROUND USING RECYCLED WATER FOR POTABLE PURPOSES. NO CLEAN WATER ACTION HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF OUR REGULATORY PROCESS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT DOES SLOW DOWN REGULATIONS WHILE CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO. DRINK CONTAMINATED WATER. BUT IT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT REGULATIONS CAN OFTEN TAKE OVER A DECADE TO FINALIZE. AND THAT IS PARTIALLY DUE TO THE MONITORING FOR CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN. THE HELP ANALYSIS DONE BY A WE HA THE ECONOMIC ANALYSES DONE BY THE STATE WATER BOARD THE PEER REVIEWS AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT INFORM ALL OF OUR DECISION MAKING. GIVEN THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SUCH A STRONG PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY. DRINKING WATER CONTAMINANTS AND TO ULTIMATELY IF NECESSARY REGULATE THEM. WE FEEL THIS PROGRAM WOULD SERVE TO IN FACT. THOUGH UNINTENTIONALLY- THERE'S A SLOW DOWN NEEDED PROTECTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC AND IT WOULD ALSO STREAM RESOURCES BOTH FINANCIAL AND IN TERMS OF STAFF TIME AND ENERGY CASH NOW WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER ON THIS BILL. WITH AN IMPACT WITH THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. BECAUSE OF OUR RESPECT FOR SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR THE SPONSORS AND FOR THE DIALOGUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. WE COULD PERHAPS SUPPORT A PROGRAM THAT EXPANDS THE CURRENT STATE BOARDS EASY PROGRAM TO LOOK AT NON DRINKING WATER ISSUES. THAT ARE NOT AS WELL SUPPORTED SCIENTIFICALLY AS IS THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM- AS IT IS CONCEIVED AS PART OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM THOUGH- RIGHT NOW WE DO. AT BILL IS SOMEWHAT. AND IN. OF ON AND DELAY AND- I THIS MOMENT WE CAN THE- WE WILL. TO DIALOGUE- GET THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RICHARD AND I AND I DO ALSO WANT TO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY INVOLVED FOR- FOR YOU KNOW FIRST I DO WANT TO I WANT TO GENERALLY THINK DEPOSITION FOR BRINGING UP WHAT I THOUGHT WERE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS I'M I'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE PEACE PROCESS US FOLKS NOW WE DID A BILL LAST YEAR ON. FIREFIGHTER FOAM AND- YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO. TO TAKE. BECAUSE OF THE BILL BECAUSE THE UNIDADE DEFIANCE IS NOT AN EMERGING AREA OF CONCERN IS AN ESTABLISHED AND PRETTY WELL KNOWN AREA OF CONCERN. AND THE CONTAMINANTS SIDE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WORK SO CLOSELY WITH THE SPONSORS LAST YEAR TO TRY TO. HELP PRODUCE. AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF P. FOR US IN OUR IN OUR GROUND WATER SYSTEM. HAVE BEENOBVIOUSLY VERY MUCH ALSO I HEAR THE CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT DELAYING ABOUT CONFLICTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE- MANY REASONS WHY WE ALSO ARE WORKING ON. LANGUAGE IN THOSE TWO AREAS TOO SO ANYWAY- OTHER FOLKS WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL PEOPLE ON ON THE CALLS I. IT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THERE IS ANYONE BUT- DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO THIRTY PRESS ONE ZERO. WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO THIRTY PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO NOW. LET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN LOOK LIKE NO ONE IS SHOWING UP. AND OKAY GREAT- LET'S NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION AND A THIRTY DOLLAR. MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORIZED THIS IS AN AREA I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND SO I JUST NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON. UNTIL HOW DOES THAT. THE CC BOARD. WHAT'S THE THAT PROCESS I GUESS FOR QUALIFYING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT ON THIS. I'M ASSUMING IT'S A BOARD IT'S A PANEL. YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT IS WHAT MY IT'S A COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS SCIENTIFIQUES SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS I THINK THE ANALYSIS THAT OUTLINES. THE SELECTION PROCESS AND I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION'S BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT THEY- ARE FREE OF CONFLICTS AND OF COURSE I SUPPORT THAT SO IT'S- IT'S BASICALLY EMPOWERING SCIENTISTS TO GET AHEAD OF. THESE EMERGING CONCERNS AND CREATING A PROCESS WITH A FUNDING SOURCE TO DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGHTS FROM THE COMMITTEE NO OKAY- FOR YEP WE GOT CLOSER YEAH I JUST APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS. IMPORT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FROM THE AND RDCS PERSPECTIVE WE TOOK THEIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WERE WORKING ON IT- I'M PLEASED THAT THEY'RE ENCOURAGING THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD I HOPE AS THEY SEE THE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT THEY'LL FORMALLY WITHDRAW THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE I. I THINK WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED- YOU KNOWWE'VE ALL MARCH FOR SCIENCE WE'VE ALL OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING SCIENCE INTEGRATE WITH PUBLIC POLICY. AND HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT TO GET AHEAD OF CONTAMINANTS AS WE GET BETTER AT DETECTING THEM AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU HAVE MISTER MOTION FOR THE CASE AND WOOD COUNTY. OF THAT AREA OF THE CITY PROCEED YOU AND SENATOR AND- YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY IN THE END OF THE DAY. THERE A THERE'S A STRUGGLE- YOU KNOW THE WATER AGENCIES OBVIOUSLY WANT TO. PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THEY ALSO HAVE A- YOU KNOW VESTED INTEREST IN IN MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME THERE ALSO ARE REGULATED ENTITY AND NOBODY LOVES TO BE REGULATED AS WE'VE HEARD MANY TASKS. CENTER DOLLY IN OTHERS AND SO AND THE OTHER QUESTION HERE IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY ARE KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE AND- THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME SOME SORT OF MECHANISM FOR SLOWING DOWN. I REGULATIONS THAT'S NEEDED TO PROTECT PEOPLE- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T END UP ON SENDING BACK ARE ARE ARE. ARE VERY INTENSE EFFORTS TO TRY TO IMPROVE DRINKING WATER YOU KNOW FOLKS LIKE CLEAN WATER ACTION ENERGY SEEN OTHERS OF WORKS OF ART ON SO. THAT'S THE KEY THING HERE BUT YES IF I MAY WE'RE ALL CONSUMERS. YEP YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT SAFE DRINKING WATER NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR OUR CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND YEAH. I THINK WE ALL SHARE THAT GOAL- AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THEIR- KIDS. SHOULD THAT CENTER. THE SUPERVISOR CARE. A SECRETARY I. CAN WITH CARL. I NUMBER SO. S. B. TWO THIRD BY SO. PORTANTINO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN. HI ALLEN AYE BATES FIVE EIGHT FIVE DOLLY. DALI I AND SALAS HI SALAS HI SKINNER STERN BY CASKEY BY. BY AYE THE- AND WE'RE HOLD THAT OPEN FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS AND BUT THANK YOU SENATOR. I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AS WELL AS WE GET THROUGH OUR AGENDA HERE OKAY AND I SEE CENTER RUBIO HERE TO PRESENT ITEM. NUMBER. EIGHTY TO SEVENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READING CENTER.

GOOD MORNING MORNING SEVEN BUCKS NOT EVEN MORNING ANYMORE AND IF CITY GOOD AFTERNOON YES SAID SITE RUN A LITTLE LONG BUT THANK YOU MISTER TERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB FOUR TWENTY SIX- LIKE THE CHAIR AND I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION AND HE'S ASKED ME TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDER FOR TOP FULLY COMMITTED TO DOING SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE SB FOUR TWENTY SIX WILL DIRECT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PRODUCE AND RELEASE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES FOR MS FOUR PERMIT EASE. BY JULY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO THE STATE GUIDELINES WOULD BE MODELED AFTER THE U. S. EPA GUIDELINES DEVELOPED OVERLAPPED THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WRITTEN GUIDELINES ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE AFFORDED THE BENEFIT OF AN OPEN PROCESS AND OTHER STATES SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS HAPPEN FINANCIALLY STRESSED WITH THE M. S. FOR PERMITTING COMPLIANCE COST AND MANY CITIES DO NOT HAVE A DEDICATED REVENUE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS WHAT THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE PANDEMIC THE SMALL CITIES ARE EVEN. MORE STRESS AND NEED OUR HELP. THIS BILL HOW NOT MADE IT TO THE FOR LINE IN PAST YEARS DUE TO THE ASSURANCES BY THE STATE WATER BOARD TO GET THEM DONE. HOWEVER IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS AND CITIES ARE STILL WAITING FOR THESE GUIDELINES TO BE HELPFUL TO THEM. SB FOUR TWENTY SIX IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSIST CITIES AND COUNTIES AND COMPLYING WITH THE CLEAN WATER ACT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE- MIGHT MY WITNESS IF I MAY. I'D IS DIANE I'M NOT MOVED MAYOR OF SOUTH PASADENA AND VICE CHAIR OF THE WATER COMMITTEE THE SANK YOU'RE A VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR RUBIO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM SOUTH PASADENA MERIT DIANA MAHMUD REPRESENTING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. AT THE SPONSOR OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX. THIS BILL WOULD DIRECT THE STATE WATER BOARD AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF STORMWATER PERMIT IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT. TO ADOPT FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY Q. THE STATE GUIDELINES WOULD BE MODELED ON U. S. EPA GUIDELINES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. AN UPDATED LAST YEAR. THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES PROVIDED TRANSPARENT METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING LOCAL AGENCY FINANCIAL CAPABILITY. SUPPORT THE COST OF CLEAN WATER ACT COMPLIANT. IN DETERMINING AFFORDABILITY THE GUIDELINES ALSO REQUIRE STORMWATER PERMIT ISSUING AUTHORITY. TO CONSIDER THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH WASTE WATER AND DRINKING WATER REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT THE TOTAL COST OF WATER RELATED SERVICES. CAN BE CONSIDERED IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. IT'S A FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR STORMWATER. PERMIT COMPLIANCE RIGHT. OR TO BILITY TRUST THE GUIDE ARE. THE PERMIT AGENT TO ESTABLISH REASON TIME FRAMES FOR PERMIT COMPLY. IS SPORTS LOCAL EIGHT TIME TO SECURE OR OTHER FUNDING BUT- SALUTE PRODUCTION- AND- THE FEDERAL. DO NOT A CALLOUSED. SB FOUR TWENTY SIX MONTHLY CALLS THE STATE BOARD ISSUE AS- FACTOR. THE CALIFORNIA. ARE FORGET THE SAME AS JIMMY MAGEE. IMPORTANT S. B.

HARD OUR DISTRICT COMMUNITIES NOTABLY IN MARCH TWENTY. THIS AUDITOR A- HI TO SPEAK AND READ WATER BOARDS THEY MUST DO MORE. TO ENSURE THAT LOOK JURORS COST REDUCE POLLUTION ARE NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE AMONG OTHER THINGS IT RECOMMENDED THE STATE WATER BOARD DEVELOP GUIDANCE BY AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DOCUMENT ESTIMATES OF THE COST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WANT HER TO COMPLY WITH THEIR STORMWATER PERMITS. WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE SUCH GUIDELINES. SB FOUR TWENTY SIX WILL PROVIDE A RATIONAL AND UNIFORMED ACTED FOR CALCULATING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY TO ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER ACT COMPLIANCE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING WATER QUALITY WE APPRECIATE SENATOR RUBIO'S LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING SB FOUR TWENTY SIX. AND RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR. I THOUGHT. AMOR ALRIGHT LET'S NOW GO TO- I I'M NOT A ON DOES THE IN THAT OR SUPPORT OR SO FOR THIS ON PHYSICALLY SO LET'S GO TO THE FOR LINES ANYONE WANTS TO ADD ONS OF FOR THIS BILL. I BEFORE TWENTY. ON THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX PRESS ONE ZERO. RIGHT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH EVEN MY NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX. PLEASE PRESS ONE IN THEIR- NOW. ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIRMAN LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ABOUT TWO PEOPLE QUEUING UP. LINE NUMBER FIFTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL ARNOLD REPRESENTING THE THREE VALLEYS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. MY NUMBER FORTY ONE ONE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRY MEMBERS THIS IS JULIE ALL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES APOLOGIES FOR BEING UNABLE TO SUBMIT OUR LETTER IN TIME TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AT THIS TIME OF THE TERM AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX. THANK YOU MA'AM HONOR OKAY LET'S NOW GO TO OPPOSITION ANYONE ONE INVOICE. OPPOSITION ON THE FRONT LINES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE ONLINE NUMBER AND PUT YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX PRESS ONE BUTTON ZERO NOW. MOMENT IS THE CHAIR. AT THE MOMENT THE CHIRLA TECHNO WANTED TO END UP IN OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR TWENTY SIX. OKAY ARE LET'S NOW MOVE TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. UNDER MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO RAISE OUR ISSUES. YES CENTER CASKEY I'LL GO ASK THE QUESTION I'M ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE- STATE BOARD ALREADY HAS THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE COMPLIANCE TIME FRAMES NOW AND IF THEY DO IT. A BILL THIS THERE IS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED TIME FRAME AND THAT THIS. ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS WOULD ADD LITTLE TO THE VALUE TO THIS- CAN YOU. ELIMINATE ON THAT THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE QUESTION AT THIS TIME IF I MAY I WILL TURN OVER TO MY- MIGHT WITNESS A DIANA MACLEOD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO METRICS- FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC. TRANSLUNAR CANONIC METRIX'S BY INDICATED- THE EPA THE USEPA GUIDELINES. ALSO CONSIDERED THE COST OF DRINKING WATER QUALITY COMPLIANCE AS WELL AS WASTEWATER QUALITY COMPLIANCE CURRENTLY THERE'S NOTHING THAT I AM AWARE OF IN THE STATE WATER- BOARD REGULATIONS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THAT. BUT METRICS ARE ESTABLISHED THAT LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT ARE THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHAT ARE THEIR INCOME LEVELS IT PROVIDES SPECIFICITY TO GUIDE. THE STATE WATER BOARD SHOWS THAT THERE CAN BE UNITS FORMED. THAT THERE WOULD BE A UNIFORM AND RATIONAL BASIS FOR DETERMINING- WHAT IS IN FACT A REASONABLE TIME FRAME FOR COMPLIANCE. AND THE COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD- THE LAST PERMIT. THAT WAS ISSUED WITHIN TWENTY TWELVE. L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AT THAT TIME ESTIMATED THAT THE COST OF COMPLIANCE- THE TOTAL COST OF COMPLIANCE WHEREAS ESTIMATED AT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS- DENTURE BREATH TESTAMENT WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T INCLUDE IT IN MY TESTIMONY BUT IT GIVES YOU. SOME IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COSTS THAT WE'RE SPEAKING OUT. AND PARTICULARLY AS MANY COMMUNITIES ARE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED IN THE WAKE. OF- OF PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC I'M DISTRESSED HAS BEEN SUFFERED BY OUR COMMUNITIES WERE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ISSUANCE OF THE NEW PERMIT BY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD WHICH WILL BE ISSUED WE BELIEVE SOMETIME BY. MID YEAR TO ASCERTAIN JUST. WHAT ADDITIONAL. I'M CLIENTS REQUIREMENTS WERE BASED. THE REASON I ASK IS YOU KNOW IN THE BAY AREA I KNOW THE THERE ARE YOU KNOW ARMY. HAVE ECONOMICS IS STILL HUNTERS OUT WHAT THE PANDEMIC AND THEY'VE GOT A TO COMPLY WITH THEM THEIR BY THAT THE REGIONAL BOARD THE NICO. THE REASONABLE TAPPED IN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THAT THAT PERIOD OF TIME SO AGAIN THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN OTHER THREE M. THAT IS IN FOR A- IS. BUT WE STILL HAVE THESE YOU KNOW THESE PERMITS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE ISSUE ONE HAVE TO DELIVERY RIGHT. WHETHER IT'S TIME SO- IT I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR ON THIS AND THIS THING BUT YOU KNOW WE WILL FIGHT. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE GET IT RIGHT AND WE AND WE AND WE DO THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE- WE GIVE THE GUIDANCE THE REGIONAL BOARD THAT IS. I GUESS WANTING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD IT FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO JUST WANT TO RESET POINT. NO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN AND IT'S VALID AND I HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIR AND- AND WE ALL WANT THIS TO BE DONE AND A FAIR EQUITABLE WAIT WAIT WAIT AND IF THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT COMPLIANCE SAID THESE ARE. COMMUNITIES I WANT TO COMPLY THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP. BUT AS I COMMITTED TO THE TO THE CHAIR I WILL CONTINUE TO. TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. THANK YOU. WE'RE IN CAN I ASK- WELL ON THOSE LINES THAT YOU. THE YOU INCLUDED SOME ATROCITIES. THE OFFICE IN THOSE. IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SOME EXTENT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN A- CONVERSATION WITH YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS TO THE BOARD OF THE MINISTRATION OVER THE OVER THE DM. YEAH THE PACE OF THEIR WORK AND- THE RESPONSIVENESS AND- AND THAT'S THAT'S A WITH YOU KNOW THAT'S A THAT'S A PART OF MOTIVATION BEHIND THE BILL SO I SEE YOU CAN GAUGE- CENTER CASKETS WELLNESS DISCUSSIONS ABSOLUTELY I WELL AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT I HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID TOPIC YEAH WE- DID THAT CITIES KEEP CALLING ME IN TERMS OF JUST THE STRESS THAT THIS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT IT GETS DONE AND SO I'LL TAKE BOTH OF YOUR KIND CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION AND I WILL UPDATE YOU ALSO AS WELL AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. OKAY OKAY THE- REMOVED CENTER DOLLY- CONTROL PLEASE CALLER I WOULD CLOSER SO SORRY. WE'VE YOUR RBG. OUTFIT BUT AS I SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO RBG THAT'S WHY WE'RE WEARING THE COLLAR AND HER HONOR BOB I THINK YOU AND JUST WITH THAT JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK BY THE WAY I THINK CENTER SKINNER. RBG MASK WHICH YOU KNOW THE LEASE. OF GREAT ALL RIGHT SO AT THE CONCERT WITH CHOLERA ON THIS IS OUR SB FOUR TWENTY SIX ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB FOUR TWENTY SIX BY SENATOR RUBIO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN. HI ALLEN AYE BATES BATES AYE DOLLY AYE DALY AYE GONZALEZ HI SALAS I SKINNER STERN. WHY CASTING. HI HOUSE I'D- FIVE WILL THAT OPEN FOR THE OTHER. THANK YOU THAT ON PARTY MEMBERS- WE'RE GOING TURN IT BACK TO OUR CHAIR OF FOR ME TO. WHAT IS THE LAST BILL THE DAY. SO WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE ALMOST MADE IT. TWO MINUTES OKAY AND THIS ONE I WILL SAY HOPEFULLY IF I WERE TO BE RESENTING IT LAST YEAR THEY WERE THE MORE DISCUSSION HOPEFULLY WITH THE WEED WE GOT SO MANY OF THE ISSUES RESOLVED LAST YEAR- WE NEGOTIATED THIS BILL AND IN THE IN THE OPPOSITION MOVE TO NEUTRAL- AND SO. BOB RECEIVED IT WOULD COVER THE REST WE USED IN MOVIES LAST YEAR BUT HERE WE ARE. SO THIS IS THIS IS FIVE OH TWO SERVICER THIS IS A MESSAGE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE ADDRESSING WEAKNESSES IN THE CURRENT GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO ADD TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THE TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES AND HISTORY CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. WHAT'S START UP A LONG TIME AGO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETIMES CALIFORNIANS ARE UNKNOWINGLY EXPOSED TO. HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE AND THE YOU KNOW THE IDEA WAS THAT THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO USE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND CLEAR TRANSPARENT. REGULATORY PROCESSES OF A START UP THIS PROGRAM SAID FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. AND THE PROGRAM IDENTIFIES. ARE CHEMICALS OF CONCERN. AND THEN- FINDS PRODUCTS WHERE THE USE OF THOSE CHEMICALS COULD BE AFFECTING CONSUMERS AND THEN CALLS UPON THE MANUFACTURERS TO PERFORM. WHAT'S CALLED AN ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS. TO FIND SUBSTITUTES. SOUTHEND'S ANALYSIS ALLOWS BUSINESSES TO TAKE THE FIRST CUT AT DETERMINING THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THE HAZARDS PRODUCED- BE OPPOSED BY THE KENNEDY CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEN- THERE'S A THERE'S A REGULATORY RESPONSE FROM FROM THE DEPARTED TALKS SUB'S TO SEE WHICH ON INCLUDES OPTIONS SUCH AS LIMITING THE USE OF THE CHEMICAL OR REQUIRING GREATER DISCLOSURE. AND THE REGULATORY RESPONSE ULTIMATELY BASED ON HOW FAR A MANUFACTURER GOES IN REDESIGNING OR RE FORMULATING A PRODUCT TO BE SAFER. NOW HERE'S THE PROBLEM SO SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT. AFTER TWELVE YEARS. THURMOND NOW THIRTEEN YEARS OF- IN IN IN IN PLACE NOT A SINGLE CHEMICAL NORD OR NOT A PRODUCT COMPANIES IN HAS EVER BEEN SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY RESPONSE. UNDER THE FRAMEWORK. SO THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SLOW AND IT'S PARTLY DUE TO DATA GAPS THAT HINDER INFORMED DECISION MAKING. AND THE INABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS WITHOUT DIRECTLY TESTING THEM OR DOING VERY TIME CONSUMING SEARCHES OR REQUESTS. FOR DATA SO THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE LOOKED AT THIS QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT YOU HAD TEN YEARS AND NOW IT'S TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS AND THERE'S SO LITTLE TO SHOW. FOR WHAT PROMISED TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEY CAME OUT WITH THESE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY STREAMLINED PROCESS THESE GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ESSENTIAL. PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA SO WHAT IS THE BILL DOING GRANTS THE DEPARTMENT CLEAR AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IF NEEDED FROM THE CHEMICAL SUPPLIERS. IT REQUIRES DGSE TO ADOPT A SEVEN YEAR TIMELINE TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS FIVE PRIORITY PRODUCTS. IT STREAMLINES THE INFORMAL RESOLUTION AN APPEALS PROCESS SEES AND IT CREATES A FAST TRACK FOR WIN EXISTING HIGH QUALITY STUDIES SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT MOVING QUICKLY TO REGULATORY RESPONSE. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SO WE FIRST INTRODUCED THE BILL LAST SESSION WE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CHEMICAL. INDUSTRY WERE CONCERNED- BUT WE REALLY WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE- ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WHILE STILL KEEPING OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE- IN IT WITH REGARDS TO OUR OUR NEEDS TO ADDRESS A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN SO I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE LANGUAGE. THAT WE REINTRODUCED HERE REFLECTS THE COMPROMISE REACHED BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THAT'S A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A CAR FROM IN OUR DC AND ANDREA VENTURA FOR WILL. CLEAN WATER ACTION YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THEM FROM THE- RIVAS BILL- AND HERE TO STAY N SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE THEY ONLINE MADAM MODERATOR. HI GOOD ENSURE HEAR ME. YES HOW GREAT I MEAN SURE NUMBER IS THE KEY TO CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL SORRY FOR PUTTING THAT MONEY AGAIN- I DON'T HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING ON TOXIC ISSUES OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING HUMAN EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS AND ON LOGGING PROGRAMS TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM THE MOST HARMFUL CHEMICALS. CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE DRAFTING TOXIC CHEMICALS BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM FOCUSING ON PREVENTING TOXIC EXPOSURES IN THE FIRST PLACE RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OR FIXING THE EFFECT OF THAT EXPOSURE AFTER THE FACT HOWEVER AS AS YOU MENTIONED THE PIECE OF THE PROGRAM WHICH LOWER THAN IDEAL BECAUSE OF STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED IN A TEN YEAR RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM BY DR GINA TOLEMAN AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE SB FIVE OH TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT. THE BILL IS CONSIDERED LAST SESSION HAVE NOT CHANGED THAT CONTINUES TO HAVE NO OPPOSITION TWENTY GAMPOLA THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE BILL OF THE PROGRAM'S LACK OF ACCESS TO PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA THE RESULT OF PROP PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AND I'M TO CRACKLE BOLLINGER EACH INDUSTRY REQUEST TO GET INFORMATION ON PRODUCT INGREDIENT THE RESULT OF AN UNNECESSARY AND SOMETIMES LENGTHY DELAYS. IF I GO TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A CLEARER STRONGER DATA COLLECTION AUTHORITY THAT STILL PRESERVES THE KEEP TRADE SECRET PROTECTION ALREADY IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY MOCK THE BILL ALSO CREATES THAT LINES AND CLEAR REQUIREMENTS BUT THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED TIMELINE FOR ACTION WHICH WOULD PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FINALLY THE BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO REMOVE REDUNDANT. MINISTRY TO PROCESS AND TO STREAMLINE THE PROGRAM WORKLOAD BUT WILL ALSO HELP IMPROVE THE PIECE OF THE PROGRAM FOR ALL THESE REASONS YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE OH TWO I ALSO LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE BILL ON BEHALF OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS THANKS. MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. NEXT TO IF SUPPORT. YES HI- THIS IS AN EVAN AGAIN WOULD COME WATER ACT IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE TO WOULD SET AL TO SEE S. B. OH TWO. WE THE UP CLEAN WATER TO BE INVOLVED IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTUAL BILL THAT ESTABLISHED THE FAVOR CONSUMER PRO- EXCUSE ME SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM- AS WELL AS ITS IMPLEMENTATION EVERY SENSE- AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS PROGRAM TAKES AN EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAT ALLOWS INDUSTRY USING TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS TO REASSESS THE NEED FOR THOSE CHEMICALS. ANALYTE SAFER ALTERNATIVES BY WHICH TO PRODUCE CONSUMER GOODS AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY PUT HER MODES CLEANERS PAPER PRODUCTS BUT ALSO WITH HIS MANDIBLE ECONOMY AND YOU ALSO HEARD THE REALITIES OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT LIVING UP TO ITS POTENTIAL GIVEN ITS SLOW PACE- AND DAD- THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT- BUT LIMITED. FORTUNATELY WE'VE HAD THE TIME AND EXPERIENCE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE REGIONAL LEGISLATION AND WHAT THE PROGRAM NEEDS SO THAT WE CAN FIX SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT MAKE THIS DISTILLATE PROGRAM THAT IT NEEDS TO BE AN SB FIVE OH TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST NEEDED REFORMS IN THE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE LIMITED DATA FROM THE MARKET PLACE AND IT MINISTRY TO INEFFICIENCIES THAT EAT UP PUBLIC RESOURCES- YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WHAT SOME OF THE SPECIFICS WOULD BE HELLO I'LL JUST AND- SAY. THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT REAL WORLD ATTACKS ON WE ALL CALIFORNIANS PEAPACK FOR INSTANCE HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCER REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL HARM IMPAIRED IMMUNITY AND EVEN INTERFERENCE WITH VACCINES- AND THIS PROGRAM HAS THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THOSE METHYLENE CHLORIDE IN PAINT STRIPPERS HAVE RESULTED IN AT LEAST. SIXTY FOUR DEATHS AROUND THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN A FORTY YEAR OLD WORKER IN HONEY TO PARK HOW. THESE ARE CHEMICALS PRODUCTS THE C. BECAUSE PRODUCTS PER IS ACT ON THE OTHER WE IT MAY WORK AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND- THE- THE- AND IT IS THAT IT WILL HELP WITH THE PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN FOR INTRODUCING IT AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL NOW GO TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT AND I DO NOT SEE ANYONE HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE- BUT ABOUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY IN TWENTY FORTY ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE THE SCREEN OUT. THERE IT IS. THEN LET'S GO TO THOSE WHO ARE ON OUR ONLINE DATA MODERATOR DO WE HAVE A LITTLE FUN. ON THE TELEPHONE LINE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND OTTOMAN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE OH TO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PUT YOU BACK INTO Q. BUT AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE OH TWO COULD PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW. FORMER MANAGER LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEONE SHOWING UP. AS GOVERNOR MY NUMBER MY NUMBER ONE SEVENTEEN YEAH LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI BILL ALIRIO WITH ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT WERE GLAD TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS PROGRAM TO KEEP CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SAFETY- FASTER THANKS. AT THE TIME AND HERE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE COULD YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO OPPOSITION- ANY ONLINE IN OPPOSITION MADAME MODERATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE OH TWO PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. ONE ZERO TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ABOUT SB FIVE ZERO TWO. ONE MOMENT MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AND I HAVE SEEN- IN IN FORTY TWO OH THREE OR- TWENTY TWENTY FORTY. SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS COMMITTEE MATTERS COMMITTEE MEMBERS JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION WHERE DOES THE FINE MONEY- IT'S A HEFTY FINE FIFTY IT COULD BE FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY. I'M ASSUMING THAT'S NOT GONNA BE RALLY GATE BUT IT WOULD BE AND I CAN EXPLAIN THE FINE SYSTEM AND WHERE THE MONEY WOULD GO IF PAGE. YES I REQUEST TO GO TO THE TNC- ULTIMATELY IT'S REALLY ABOUT DISTANCE DURING COMPLIANCE ARE THERE THERE'S NO OTHER WITH THIS IS HOW YOU PUT INSIDE YOUR GET PEOPLE TO COMPLY WITH WITH- NOW WITH THE WITH THE PROGRAM. I MEAN DATA THEN AND I JUST OBVIOUSLY REMIND YOU THAT IF. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS EVEN WITH THIS BILL- NEAR THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT- THE FINES WOULD ONLY KICK IN IN THE CASE OF THE COMPANY THAT'S PUTTING A KNOWN. TOXIC CHEMICAL OUT THERE THAT- IS IN VIOLATION CLEAR VIOLATION. ANALYSTS SAY- YEAH THE VERY SINISTER GROUPS WHO WOULD HAVE MOST TO FEAR FROM THIS- HAVE OF NEGOTIATED THAT WITH US AND HAVE NOW DROPPED OPPOSITION. DO IT IN YOUR ORIGINAL TESTIMONY YOU SAID THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PROCESS HASN'T REALLY WORKED OUT WELL AND IS THERE MUST BE SOME DEBATE OR SOME. THE BILL BILLY NOT GET INFORMATION OR HAVE INFORMATION BUT THE PRODUCTS ARE STILL. BEING THERE SO I MISS MY CONCERN IS IT'S LIKE. I REALLY DON'T LIKE AGENCIES HAVE AN ABILITY TO FIND THE MONEY GOES BACK TO THEM IT'S THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO FIND IF THAT'S- THE SCENARIO WE SEE NOT AND OTHER AGENCIES WHERE THEY- KEEP THOSE REASON. THOSE MONIES IN THEIR COFFERS AND SO. THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO FIND WHEN YOU. DON'T HAVE A GOING BACK YOUR COFFERS THERE'S LESS INCENTIVE FOR YOU TO FIND AND ACTUALLY GET TO THE RESULT. THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE. THE FIRM HAS CONCEPTS BY EMINEM I'M WILLING TO MOVE TO THE BILL I MEAN I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING BY PROTECTING TRADE SECRETS BUT ALLOWING PRODUCT INGREDIENTS TO GET THERE IT'S A TRICKY IT'S A TRICKY PROCEDURE FOR YOU CAN HAVE THE SCIENTISTS LOOK AT IT JUST SO THAT THEY CAN ANALYZE THE HARMFUL EFFECTS AND I PLUGGED IT IN OBVIOUSLY ADMINISTRATIVE A- EFFICIENCIES IS ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON% LOOK FOR BUT I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AUTHOR YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF AS FAR AS- IS FAR AS THE- SUCCESS OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND- AND IT IS A- UNIQUE. ONE OF A KIND IN THE WORLD WHEN IT GOT CAUGHT UP CAUGHT BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF PRODUCERS. CENTER PICK MAKING SAFER. ATTACKS AND USING LESS HARMFUL PRODUCTS AS LONG AS IT'S STILL CLEANS MY HOUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON THAT LIST THEY DON'T WANT TO BE A CHEMICAL OF CONCERN THEY WERE THERE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES SO WELL WE MAY NOT HAVE A- BODY COUNT HERE AT DGSE ABOUT. THE CHEMICALS ARE OUT THE INDUSTRY HAS SORT OF SELF CORRECTED AS BEST THEY CAN THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY THEY'LL BE PEOPLE COME AND SAY WE HAVE TO USES BUT- THE- THE- TOTAL AMOUNT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A SUCCESS AND I THINK. THESE ARE IMPROVEMENTS. TO STATE AND SEE WHAT THAT'LL HOLD THE BILL. I DO HAVE A QUESTION OR A COMMENT OF SENATOR ALLEN I DO BELIEVE- THE PENALTIES ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH. IT WHAT TROUBLES ME ABOUT THEM AND THEY SEEM TO BE TIED TO AN AUTHORITY THEY DE TFC HAVE- IF THEY AREN'T. YOU KNOW LET'S SAY CONVINCED BY THE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS THEY'RE ALLOWED- THAT MANUFACTURES ALLOWED TO MAKE THEY CAN ACTUALLY ARE. YOU KNOW SUPERSEDE THAT AND DO THEIR OWN AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT THERE'S A- POTENTIAL FOR AN SANTA. ANA VERY LARGE FINE. ART TO SAY GEE I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU PRESENTED TO US SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR OWN OUR- SOURCES AND GET ANOTHER ANALYSIS PHILIP FEELS A DIFFERENT DOES THAT PERSON DOWN- IF THAT PERSON SUBJECTED TO A FINE ENOUGH NOT CLEARLY DEFINED ENOUGH. SO I THINK ARE THERE NEEDS TO BE A TIGHTER- RESTRICTION ON IT WHEN THOSE PENALTIES APPLY. AND WHAT AND NOW THE FEES ON. MEET THE STANDARDS HEAD DOES SEEM TO BE A LITTLE LOOSE IN THE WAY THEY'VE CONSTRUCTED AND I KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THAT FOR SENATE CHALLENGE TO GET BUSINESS OPPOSITION OFF BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT FROM. LAST YEAR BUT THOSE ARE STILL PROBLEM AREAS FOR ME. ARE YOU JUST IT IT MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT IT'LL TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE PAGA. WHERE YOU DIDN'T DODD AND I AND CROSS THE T. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE HERE HERE AND HERE IN TROUBLE WITH THE AGENCY SO- TAKE A TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I THINK WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL JUST LAY OFF. BY IT DOES COME TO APPROPRIATIONS IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY OFTEN IN MY WORK. BETWEEN NOW. AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THAT. YEAH I MEAN I WELL I GUESS MY QUESTION THE FOR THE TO YOU. MY FRIENDS I MEAN I YEAH ELSE DO. SO YOU KNOW. B. THERE ASKING FOR INFORMATION. THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE THIS DETERMINATION NECESSARY IN TERMS OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THE COMPANY JUST. OUT NOT REFUSES TO. COMPLY WITH INFORMATION REQUESTS. AND THEY MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO GET THEM TO COMPLY WHAT WHAT OTHER WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE DO I MEAN SHOULD WE DO IT REALLY JUST. TELL THE COMPANY THAT YOU KNOW THAT OKAY WE'RE WE'RE GONNA LET YOU OFF SCOT FREE WITHOUT PROVIDING THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION OR- IS THERE THAT IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO ENFORCE I GUESS THAT'S MY THANK YOU CAN APPROACH THE FINE MEDIAN ECONOMIC. TEARS SO IF WE CAN USE THAT PART. THE BASE. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE OUT RIGHT OR GOING TO REFUSE- BUT I DO THINK THERE THERE CAN BE A DISPUTE CLEARLY BETWEEN MY ANALYSES THAT I PROVIDED YOU AND YOU NOT ACCEPTING IT. AND THAT'S WHERE THE AGENCIES KIND OF BECOME THE RULING CLASS ON ON OUR BUSINESSES LIKE I DON'T LIKE WHICH YOU PROVIDED ME THEREFORE- I NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I. I DO THINK THAT THAT WILL OCCUR BUT THAT BUT THAT'S JUST INEVITABLE SO MAYBE. YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T MEET THE STAFF IF YOU DON'T HAVE A STANDARD THAT THEY NEED TO MEET IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY PROVIDE YOU. DID THEY GO OUT AND SEEK SCIENTIFIC ANALYSES OR DID THEY JUST TAKE IT IN HOUSE AND EVERYBODY DECIDED WILL SHOOT WE'VE HAD THAT THE PRODUCT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE THERE'S NO DATA TO SUPPORT THAT. WHERE IS THE TFC WOULD HAVE SOME NEW VERY UPDATED INFORMATION THAT YEAH THAT IS THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S NOW CREATED A WHOLE CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE A CERTAIN KIND OF BILL NOW FOR CANCER WHATEVER. FULL BUT IF I'M GETTING INTO THE WEEDS BUT BELIEVE ME THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. WHEN I GET THE INFORMATION FOR MY CONSTITUENTS WHEN THEY'VE GONE BEFORE AN AGENCY GONE TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT AGENCY TO TRY TO GET FROM FLORIDA. YOU KNOW LESS ON OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. MOST OFTEN THEY'RE NOT GIVEN THAT THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY THE THAT THE- CLOCK TICKS ON THEM PROVIDING THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED THE STANDARD OF THE AGENCY VERSUS WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD DO AND I'M JUST SAYING. IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE FINE OR PUT IT IN YOU KNOW A TEARS. ARE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY STARTING EIGHT THIRTY ONE. THAT'S HUGE. THEY WERE JUST COMING OUT OF A PANDEMIC. WE'VE GOT MANUFACTURES THIRTY YOU TO GEAR UP AGAIN ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING OF THE POWER WITH THE BACK. RIGHT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A- ENOUGH BECAUSE AEN'T. AND SHOW WERE ALL OF THE IS PRETTY. SO I I'M JUST. I'M WE'LL SEE SO SECTION. WHICH IS YOU KNOW. IS NINE TEN ELEVEN OF BILLS SERVE DOES LAY. THE YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION OF YOUR- IT'S IT IT. IS NOT A ENDED I MEAN IF YOU KNOW. HAPPY TO. LOOK AT WITH YOU TO TIGHTEN UP IF THAT'S- THERE'S DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND ABOUT WORK GOOD FOR- YOU KNOW I MEAN LOOK I HEAR YOU AND I UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF THE BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT THE REGULATORY STATE I GUESS I. YOU KNOW I WE'RE WE'RE ME THAT THE PROBLEM WE HAD HERE IS THAT WE KNOW THERE'S DAM DANGEROUS THIRD INTEREST CHEMICALS OUT THERE- YOU THE IF THE AGENCY DOES ITS OWN ANALYSIS BY THE WAY THERE'S NO FINE I MEAN THIS IS LITERALLY JUST TO ALLOW THEM. TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED- AND THERE IS. A CLEAR DELINEATION- IN IN THE BILL SECTION FIVE THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW HAPPY TO HAPPY TO. GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF FURTHER IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE DOESN'T ALLOW FOR. YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF GOOSE CHASE. YEAH WELL STILL I MEAN THE OTHER DAY WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA REPORT TO ME AND WHEN I'M NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY TO COMPROMISE ON IS IT. IS MAKING IT SO THAT. IN THE- THE COMPANY'S CAN'T HEAR MY MIGHT GIVE THE- THE DEPARTMENT. TOO MUCH OF A RUN AROUND AS THEY TRY TO DO THEIR WORK AND AS WE SAY. THIS WHOLE PROGRAM HAS GOTTEN BOGGED DOWN OVER THE LAST TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS NOW. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. THE AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS IT NEEDS. TO TAKE TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS- SO WHAT COMES TO APPROPRIATIONS SUB FINISH OUR FULL IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN LET'S HAVE OUR STAFF CHATTER I CAN TRICK YOU ACTUALLY T. OKAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T READ PAGE WHATEVER IT WATER SHOULD NOT. FULLER WOULD YOU LIKE TO THE TO PROVIDE YOUR CLOTHES YEAH I KNOW HAPPY SO HAPPY TO WORK WITH MY CALL I'M SORRY IT IS A GROUP THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A SCENARIO OF. THOSE SO CALLED- THE METAL BROMIDE. I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT IF YOU AGAINST IT NEVER CULTURE USES. ARE USED TO USE I SHOULD SAY. AND YOU KNOW. THEY WENT THROUGH ALL KINDS OF REGULATORY. HURDLES AND BASICALLY DID TO ERADICATE METHYL BROMIDE WHICH IS VERY CRITICAL TO. KEEPING MEMENTOS AND STRAWBERRIES AND THEIR THEIR SEASON AMMONS AND THEN THERE'S REALLY NOT OTHER VERY GOOD- ALTERNATIVES. AND IT MESSED IT NATURALLY OCCURS AT OCCURRING THE GASES THAT COME FROM NOT THE BROMIDE. AND SO MY CONCERN IS EXACTLY OKAY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GOT IT WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. ALL RIGHT EVEN THOUGH WE ALL WANT TO FIND SOME OTHER ALTERNATE BUT THERE ISN'T AN ALTERNATIVE. THEN WHAT'S THE PROCESS AFTER THAT. I JUST USED BUILT THE BERLIN IS NOT PROBABLY IN THIS CATEGORY BUT WELL RIGHT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR THOSE. COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVE A PRODUCT IN OBVIOUSLY THE REASON THAT WE'VE SEEN THE DELAY FOR ALL THESE YEARS IS THERE STRAIGHT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF USE LIKE WD FORTY. DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT SENATE BUT WE KNOW THAT IT TOOK HIM FORTY TRIES TO GET. WATER DISPLACEMENT- AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY LAWSUIT OVER THAT YEARS AGO ABOUT. PEOPLE WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE IT SO. I WANNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE TROUBLED MY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WORK WHAT'S THE ABILITY. FOR THE PRODUCERS TO BE ABLE TO SAY HEY THAT THERE'S JUST NO. THERE'S NO OTHER- ALTERNATE. YEAH WELL THAT I MEAN IT'S SO THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF DOWN THE- I MEAN THAT THAT'S DOWN THE DOWNTHE LINE RIGHT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST GATHERING THE INFORMATION AT THIS POINT- HERO BY THE NEAR THE DAY IT'S- THE REGULATORY RESPONSE VANS. IT'S ALL ABOUT MITIGATING EXPOSURE- FOR THE PUBLIC. AND IF THERE IS NOT A GOOD ALTERNATIVE AND BY THE WAY ANOTHER THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT DURING OUR LAST DISCUSSION AGREE CHEMISTRY IS. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IS WE YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET RID OF ONE CHEMICAL AND THEN. THERE'S NOT A THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE INTO BEING A REGRETTABLE ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE IT ENDS UP BEING JUST AS DANGEROUS IF NOT MORE. THAN THE ONE THAT YOU FACED OUT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS THIS IS COMPLICATED STUFF IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR DEPARTMENT NEEDS. THE DAY THAT I NEED THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SCIENTISTS WORK WITH AND REVIEW AND CAN GO THROUGH THE DATA. SO THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN HELP MAKE WHY EVEN MORE WISE DECISIONS I DO THINK HOWEVER. THAT THE PRODUCERS. WHO HAVE SUCH A CLEAR VESTED INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH- YOU KNOW WITH WITH WITH WITH DEAL WITH A LOT OF. YOU KNOW. BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THESE PRODUCTS AND GET THEM OUT THERE- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEIR WORK CHECK THERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE. A MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK OVER THEIR DATA AND THEN AND THEN MAKE DETERMINATIONS- AND BUT BUT YOU THIS WHOLE REGRETTABLE TURN OF ISSUE IT IS A BIT A REAL ONE AND THEN AND- YEAH. I BUT THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I GUESS THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT. OKAY THERE IS NO TO ALTERNATIVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PRODUCT THAT IT'S ABOUT MITIGATING EXPOSURE IT'S ABOUT JUST FINDING WAYS TO MAKE. MAKE EXPOSURE IN. TRYING TO REDUCE EXPOSURE AND MAKE IT SAFER FOR FOLKS AND- YEAH THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO DO AWAY WITH. TOXICITY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE'RE TALKING HERE. YOU HAVE TO. ROBERT THE FACT STROKES. SO HERE THAT THE PUBLIC HEARD THOSE COMMENTS WERE TAKEN. HAVE YOU COULD PUT IT ON THE MIKE RIGHT. CENTER SOME ACOSTA JUST SAYING THAT THIS IS ALL TO THIS ABOUT CONSUMER CONSUMER FACING PRODUCTS AS OPPOSED TO AS OPPOSED TO COMMERCIAL THAT'S OF THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THANK YOU SENATE. ANYWAY I LOOK AYE AYES AS WITH ALL THESE BILLS I'M I'M- I'M- YOU KNOW TRYING TO HELP MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK A LITTLE BETTER AND TO MEET MEET THE TENTACLES OF THE- ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. IN THIS CASE AND- HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES OFFICES TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO RUN. MAKE THE BILL BETTER- YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY MY CORE GOAL HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. REALLY HAS THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN. SO FAR YOU KNOW IF YOU MAY HAVE HAD A DETERRENT EFFECT AND THAT'S FANTASTIC I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY CAN ACT. AND WHEN THERE ARE. PRODUCTS OUT% THERE THAT- HE DID SO WITH THAT ARE THAT ARE CLEARLY- DANGEROUS IN AND OUT OF COMPLIANCE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NEIGHBOR. AND YOU THIS IS- DO PASSED TO BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. OF COAL PLEASE. DO WE HAVE A MOTION SIR IF I THOUGHT ON THIRTY SEVEN. ITEM NUMBER NINE SB FIVE OH TWO BY SENATOR ALAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALLEN HI ALAN I'D BATES. NOT VOTING. PAGE NOT VOTING DOLLY. DALY NOT VOTING GONZALEZ I DOLLARS SPY SKINNER STERN BY CAL SKI A SKI I.
