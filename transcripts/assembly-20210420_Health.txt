NO WE JUST ARE YOU OPPOSED TO BEING HERE JUST OPPOSED. THANK. I THINK HE'S HERE HELLO IS HERE BONTA. BURKE. WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S HERE AND WHO'S WHATEVER OKAY PLEASE GO AHEAD CARILLO. LARA MAIENSCHEIN MCCARTY NAZARIAN. RIVAS. RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO WALDRON. YEAH I HAVE A FARM WHERE WE HAVE A WELL OILED QUORUM HERE SO. TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MISTER VICE CHAIR. HEY I KNOW THAT- WE DIDN'T HEAR FOM- THE TABLE GOOD COMMUNICATIONS OF FOLKS- THEY DO HAVE AT PROVIDE US A LETTER- IN OPPOSITION WITH. A NINE OR TEN DIFFERENT- REASONS WHY THEY WANTED TO OPPOSE- AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT AMENDMENTS THAT THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED. IN I DID NOTICE THAT THIS NINE EIGHT WAS ACTUALLY STATUS THAT SIGNED INTO LAW BY- BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT- AND- AND I GUESS THIS IS JUST A STATE BY STATE OF US IN ACTING IT BUBBLE WHY. A WHITE WHY OPPOSE THIS IF IT WOULD BE OKAY TO BE ABLE TO ASK- MISTER ROSCOE. THANK YOU JUST A MOMENT MAYES. THE CABLE INDUSTRY WE'RE VERY SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING ITS FULL IMPLEMENTATION OUR ONLY CONCERN IS DEALING WITH THE- COLLECTION OF THE SURCHARGE- THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. IT DOES NOT PARALLEL WHAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE FCC. AT THE COMPARISON HAS BEEN MADE THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO NINE ONE ONE. IN THE NINE ONE ONE COLLECTION OF THE SURCHARGE WE DON'T PAY FOR THE POLICE AND FIRE AND AMBULANCE THAT RESPOND. TO EMERGENCIES THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. WOULD REQUIRE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE INVOICED CUSTOMERS PAY AN ADDITIONAL SURCHARGE TO NOT ONLY CONNECT THE CALL WHICH IS WHAT NINE ONE ONE DOES. BUT IT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDE THE ACTUAL SERVICES. SO THE AS WRITTEN IT'S- VERY VERY BROAD. AND WOULD INCREASE AT A SIGNIFICANT SURCHARGE TO ALL VOIGTS CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FOR THAT WE WOULD. HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE OUT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND REQUEST THAT YOU LIMIT. AS A NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE IS LIMITED. THANK YOU AND IF I CAN MISTER CHAIR I REALIZE THIS IS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE THIS IS NOT- THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS. JURISDICTION OVER A TELECOM BUT- MISS ROSS ACTUALLY TO MAKE THE ACT OUT IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION IF I IF I CAN'T IF WE SIT DOWN- AND THE QUESTION THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE BECAUSE I RECENTLY SET. A SET UP. A NEW TELEPHONE AND INTERNET. SERVICE THROUGH A- A TELECOM COMPANY. AND THE BILL CAME AND THEY TOLD ME OVER THE PHONE AFTER BEING ON THE PHONE WITH THEM FOR ABOUT FROM ABOUT FORTY MINUTES. AND THE THEY SAID I WAS GOING TO BE A HUNDRED AND. FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH SO GREAT. THAT GREAT. AND THEN I GET FIRST BILL AND IT'S A HUNDRED FOUR TO A MONTH. A AND YOU KNOW THAT'S OVER THIRTY PER. OF WHAT I WAS TOLD THE COSTS WERE IT WAS ALL FEDERAL AND STATE. ERIS ARE TAXES THAT WERE THERE AND I THINK OFTENTIMES WE JUST FORGET THAT THAT THAT THAT EXIST THOSE ARE REAL REAL REAL DOLLARS. WHAT'S THE AMOUNT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE HEALTH- COMMITTEE BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THIS IS A PROPER PROGRAM WHAT THE FEW MIGHT BE IN- AND WHY IS IT A DEEP AND IT DOES. TO THE TELECOM COMPANIES HAVE ANY. INPUT INTO IT AT ALL OR IS IT JUST DONE BY UP OF FEDERAL FEDERAL STATE. LEGISLATURES AND OR OR REGULATORY BODIES AND JUST ADDED ON. YEAH YOU CAN AND THE ANSWER THAT. SO THAT PIECE OF THE LEGISLATION IS NOT CLEAR ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF THE SURCHARGE- RIGHT NOW WE CLICK TO SURCHARGE FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM TO HEARING IMPAIRED CALIFORNIA BANNED SERVICES FUND- THE HIGH COST ONE EIGHTEEN P. THERE'S A STRICT FORMULA FOR HOW THAT'S CALCULATED THE NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE WAS CALCULATED ON- YES COMES. BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE FOR AN APPROVED BUDGET AFTER YOU APPROVE THAT BUDGET THEN THEY DETERMINE HOW MANY ACCESS LINES ARE OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC AND THEY DO SOME SIMPLE MATH AND COME UP WITH A RATE TO NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE CAN ONLY BE BETWEEN THIRTY NO MORE THAN EIGHTY CENTS PER ACCESS LINE PER MONTH. THIS BILL IS SILENT ON THE ON THE AMOUNT HAS TO BE COLLECTED WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS. IN WHATEVER. COSTS ARE OUT THERE. THE PHONE CUSTOMER WILL BE THE BACKSTOPS TO MAKE UP FOR ANY SHORT SHORTFALLS. SO RATHER THAN JUST LIMIT THE SURCHARGE TO PAY FOR THE INTER OPERABILITY OF CONNECTING A CALL. IT IS ALSO IT IS VAGUE AS TO. WHAT OTHER SERVICES CAN BE CHARGED TO THE PHONE CUSTOMERS SO. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE IN THIS BILL I HAVE NO CLUE BECAUSE IT'S THE SKY'S THE LIMIT THERE'S NO CAP THERE'S NO LIMIT THERE'S NO DESCRIPTION OF HOW FAR IT WOULD GO OTHER THAN TO SAY. THE PHONE CUSTOMER WOULD BE THE BACKSTOP FOR WHATEVER COSTS WERE NOT COVERED. OKAY THANK AND THEN ONE FINAL QUESTION DONE AND MAYBE THE AUTHOR I CAN GET ANSWER THIS- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TWO ONE ONE. WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY JUST GET USED TO IT NINE ONE ONE OF THIRTY TO GET SOMEBODY IT'S NINE ONE ONE- AND SORT OF MAGIC THAT THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF EDUCATION OR SOME SORT OF- ADDS SPEND. A DOES THE ARE THE FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED GOING TO GO OUT TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE BECAUSE I MEAN I WOULD IMAGINE THERE HAVE TO BE. A VERY LARGE- PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. AWARE TO THOSE DOLLARS COME FROM TO BE ABLE TO DO THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. IS NOT BUILT INTO THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER IS IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I CALL SERVICE ADDRESS GEORGE YOU KNOW HOW TO. HELP YOU GET YOUR- SO ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY IS WE- WE WILL BE PUTTING A CAP ON THE- THE AMOUNT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO. WORKING WITH THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. AND WHAT THE ACTUAL COST OF SETTING UP THIS PHONE SYSTEM IS- AS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS BODY NOW I THINK ALL OF US WERE HERE WHEN WE APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL NINE ONE OR IF YOU ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY WE WANT TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE SAME CAPABILITY WITH NINE EIGHT EIGHT- BUT THERE WILL BE A CAP SO IT ISN'T JUST GOING TO BE UNLIMITED SPENDING I WANT THAT TO BE VERY CLEAR. AND WE ALSO AS REFLECTED IN COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- AT. FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALLOWS US TO- COVER OBVIOUSLY ANY TELEPHONE FIA'S COMES THROUGH FEDERAL. ENABLING LEGISLATION AS THIS GUY'S. AND THE FEDERAL. AS YOU KNOW. SIGNED BY. PRESIDENT OF. THE OTHER PARTY BUT I'M- SO I. LED IT IT ACTUALLY DOES ALLOW US TO BOTH PAY FOR THE PHONE SYSTEM ITSELF. AND ALSO FOR THE SUPPORT TO RESPOND TO THOSE CALLS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS NETWORK. AND WE THINK THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND THEN YOU ASKED ABOUT. AND IMPLEMENTATION EDUCATION I WANT TO BUY ONE THING WHICH IS. IF YOU WERE TO ONCE THIS PHONE NUMBER IS IN PLACE IF YOU CALL NINE ONE ONE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS YOU WILL BE TRANSFERRED TONIGHT EIGHT ONCE THIS IS IN. PLACE SO IF PEOPLE. CONTINUE TO CALL NINE ONE ONE BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE THEY WILL BE SENT TO THESE. AND CALL CENTERS WHERE WE CAN HANDLE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SO IN THE BEGINNING. PEOPLE MAY CALL THE WRONG NUMBER AND THEY WILL STILL GET THE SERVICES AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WILL BE ENSURING THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU CALL YOU GET THE PROGRAM. RESPONSE AND SERVICES- BUT I WILL ALLOW TERROR TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT EDUCATION AND HOW THAT HAS GONE INTO OTHER STATES ARE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF US SO SHE MAY HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT. ABSOLUTELY WE'RE IN VERY CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE NATIONAL BY PREVENTION- DANCE AND THAT EACH AND THERE IS A BAD CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT EDUCATION LOOKS LIKE AND THERE WILL BE FEDERAL FUNDING AND SUPPORT NATION UP COMING DOWN TO SUPPORT THAT AND WE OUTLINED IN THE BILL THAT THE STATE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING NINE EIGHT EIGHT UP ELABORATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIFIED WHICH- THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY I JUST HAVE A COMMENT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRING IN THE FOURTH YOU KNOW WE'VE INSTEAD OF FACING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. AND HAVING A DEDICATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM CAN HELP PREVENT THE TRAGEDIES THAT OCCUR FAR TOO OFTEN MENTAL HEALTH CALLS ARE HANDLED IN THE SAME PROCESS CALLS ARE ABOUT CRIMES IN PROGRESS. WE HAVE TO TRANSFORM A MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DELIVER MORE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE TO CARE. I HOPE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR RODRIGUEZ THIS QUICK COMMENTS WERE ALSO ON A STRONG. TALKING STRONG SUPPORT AS A CO AUTHOR OF A- THIS BILL IS A VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE- MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDER FOR FOLKS QUESTION THE MERIT. MERCY SETTING SO LOOK FOR SUPPORT IN A AND R. THANK YOU FOR A COMPANY TO BE A COOPERATIVE FOR SPRINT ABOUT THINKING. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. A COUPLE AYE SOME COMMENTS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME HERE SO VERY VERY COMPLEX BILL I THINK WE'LL ALL AGREE THAT- AND EVEN IF THE ISSUE IS EVEN MORE COMPLEX SO IT PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TO YOUR BILL- BUT FAILURE TO PASS A BILL THIS YEAR- THAT DOES NOT MEAN CALIFORNIA GETS A PASS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION- DATE OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND WHAT FAILURE TO PASS A BILL WOULD MEAN IS CALIFORNIA WILL BE FORCED TO RESPOND WITHOUT ANY FUNDING OR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. PUTTING TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON AN ALREADY BURDENED CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. MOST MOST IMPORTANTLY WHILE FAILURE TO MEET THE DEADLINES IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW. WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY PENALTIES. PEOPLE WILL BE PUT IN JEOPARDY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION WOULD MEAN CALLS GO UNANSWERED PEOPLE MAY NOT RECEIVE NEEDED CARE AND OUTCOMES FOR CALLERS COULD BE WORSE THAN THEY ARE NOW. I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR AT THAT THE AUTHOR NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THE MANY AREAS OF CONCERN I BELIEVE GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE EVEN JUST THIS MORNING TOWARDS REACHING A CONSENSUS. AND THAT IS VERY ENCOURAGING SO IN AS MUCH AS THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFER TO COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE- AND THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT CRISIS CARE SYSTEM AND THE CORRESPONDING FUNDING MECHANISM OR CRITICAL THIS YEAR. FROM THE HEALTH COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED THE BILL MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS WE HOPE WILL ULTIMATELY BE REFLECTED IN IN THE FINAL BILL SORRY EXPECTATION THAT ALL PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. AND THEN WE SEE THIS BILL BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY WILL ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OUTLINED- AND WILL REPRESENT A SOLID PARTNERSHIP. THAT BUILDS OUT THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT CRISIS CALL CENTERS SO- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BUILDING ON THE IN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECIPIENT ENHANCING RESPONSE DISPATCH AND DELIVERY OF CRISIS CARE SERVICES. AFTER HAVING SAID ALL THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER MAYBE IN A COAL. YOUR BILL- WITH THE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HONORED TO HAVE YOU AS A COP AND I WANT TO THANK ALL MY CO AUTHORS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND ACROSS THE LEGISLATURE. THIS EFFORT IN WASHINGTON WAS A BI PARTISAN EFFORT IT IS HERE AS WELL BECAUSE- THEY NEED TO SUPPORT OUR COMPARTMENT EASING CRISIS RIGHT NOW IS EVIDENT. TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THIS IS A HUGE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THIRD OF ON HOUSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR THE FAMILIES LIKE YOU HEARD TODAY. HELLO PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET. AN APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RESPONSE WE HEARD FROM TOWN HALL WE ALSO HEARD FROM A FEW OF ANGELO CANTOS FAMILY MEMBERS ANOTHER. INDIVIDUAL CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHO DIED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE WHILE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. AND IT'S TIME WE MAKE THIS NECESSARY CHANGE AND AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED WERE ALSO FORCED TO BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT'S WE NEED TO DO IT WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT AND THIS IS COMPLEX LEGISLATION. BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH OVER SEVENTY FIVE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. AND THEN WE GET IT RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA WE GET IT RIGHT FOR THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING AND ARE IN CRISIS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND FEEDBACK ON THIS BILL I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY. AB ONE FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR WALAU REGISTERED NURSE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF A BLOOD COLLECTION AT A MOBILE BLOOD BANK. TO BE AVAILABLE BY VIDEO TELECONFERENCE. BLOOD DONATIONS SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION WE KNOW THAT AND ACCORDING TO THE BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA SOMEONE NEEDS A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. EVERY THREE SECONDS. DONATED BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT INJURIES AND DISEASES. AND EVEN CANCER HEART DISEASE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS. AND AS WELL AS SEVERE TRAUMATIC INJURIES. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE RELY ON THE KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY OF BLOOD DONORS TO HELP SAVE SICK AND VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. UNFORTUNATELY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE BLOOD COLLECTIONS SCARCER. BUT CURRENT REGULATIONS ALLOW FOR DEVIATIONS FROM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. LAST APRIL GOVERNOR'S THEM EVEN ISSUED AN ORDER AND ENCOURAGING HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST TO THE- ADJUSTER PRACTICES. THAT WE FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUDGET NATIONS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT LATELY AS INDIVIDUALS WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVERAGE. NINETEEN CAN DONATE BLOOD WITH THEIR ANTIBODIES TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY SICK AND EVEN HELP TO CONTINUE TO STUDY THE VIRUS. KERN FLEXIBILITY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. THAT ARE STILL COLLECTED SAFELY RESPONSIBLY EITHER WITH A NURSE ON SITE OR AVAILABLE VIDEO TELECONFERENCING. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I AM JOINED TODAY BY SOME A GALLEY THE PRESIDENT CEO OF HOUSING COMMITTEE BLOOD BANK WHICH HAS HAD SUCCESS OR ORCHESTRATING BLOOD DONATIONS THIS PAST YEAR.

OKAY MY NAME IS SEAN NOW I AM THE PRESIDENT DOES DO ACTION COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK IN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA. AND I AM TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BUT THANKS A BIRD COLLECTION PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SAVING LIVES PARTICULARLY IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WITH THE CODE NINETEEN THAT THE PANDEMIC IMPACTS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL WILDFIRE WILL FIRE HER MERGING THESE. HOSPITALS AND CARE GIVERS NEED TO HAVE THE NECESSARY BLOOD SUPPLY WHICH COINCIDENTALLY. IT'S AN ALL TIME LOW. OUR POLICIES MAY NEED NURSES ON SITE AT ALL TIMES THAT ARE PERMANENT LOCATIONS BUT DOING SO AND OR MOBILE SITES CUT SIGNIFICANTLY INTO OUR ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE BLOOD COLLECTION. AND THAT'S JUST THE FACT OF THE MATTER. IF WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY CONDUCTOR MOBILE SITE COLLECTIONS WITH NURSES WHO ARE NOT PRESENT AT THE MOBILE SITE BUT ALWAYS IN CONSTANT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. WE'RE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE OUR BOOK COLLECTION AND WE CAN DO THIS FOR PROVIDING FULLY FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO DONATE BLOOD AT THOSE SITES. SHE MAINTAIN CPR. TRAINED AND CERTIFIED STAFF. TO ADMINISTER RESEARCH. ANOTHER FOR STATUS ALL OUR LOCATIONS. THE NATION'S AFTER NOT MEDICAL OFFICES WITH MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OTHER THAN WHAT IS USED TO COLLECT BLOOD. AND THE FACT IS THAT IT'S THE P. R. IN GENERAL FOR AID CONSTITUTE THE FULL EXTENT OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION POSSIBLE. WHAT WOULD YOUR RESPONSE TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL IN THE EVENT OF BLOOD DONOR APPEARS. HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. BUT IT'S GIVING TO THE OF WORK ARE. RARE DONATION SITES IN FACT I WOULD WAGER THAT IT IS MORE DANGEROUS YOUR MORE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT- DRIVING TO AND FROM THE BLOOD DONATION SITE- THEN- ACTUALLY DONATING BLOOD. JUST THE GOVERNOR. EXECUTIVE RDER ALLOWING BLOOD DONATION WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF A NURSE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERIOUS INCIDENTS THE PROCESSES WORKED WELL. I IN FACT AT HOUCHENS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BLOOD SUPPLY DURING THIS PERIOD WHICH IS KIND OF INCREDIBLE- THAT IT SPEAKS TO THE FACT OF- THE- DID NOT A FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY THAT ALLOWS US. ALL WE ARE ASKING IS TO KEEP DOING WHAT IS THAT THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE. AND FINALLY I WOULD ASK YOUR IDOL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONTO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YES THANK YOU YOUR WORD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS LAURIE KAMMERER I AM THE- ON BEHALF OF HOUSING COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR- HOUSING IS A CO SPONSOR ON THE BILL- PENSION.

HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR WOULD AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER O'MALLEY I AND THE LEGISLATIVE ACT CAN'T FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE RESPECTFULLY URGE OPPOSITION TO AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD READ THE HEALTH OF BLOOD BANK OWNERS. THIS BILL WOULD END OF. THAT BLOOD BANKS HAVE A REGISTERED NURSE PHYSICALLY PRESENT DURING BLOOD DRAWS AND INSTEAD ALLOW OUR AND TO MONITOR THE PROFITS VIA TELECONFERENCE. WELL WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS WILLINGNESS TO AMEND THE BILL SUCH THAT OUR ROOMS AVAILABLE BY TELECONFERENCE MUST BE REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT PATIENTS HELP COULD BE READ BY THIS CHANGE. ONE SUCH CONCERN INCLUDES RED THAT COULD BE EXACERBATED AND RURAL AREAS WITH LESS RELIABLE INTERNET. SERVICE THIS LIKELY LONGER TRAVEL TIMES REPEAT CARE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE BLOWS UP LIKE THE INTERNET AND DROPPED CALLS DURING TELECONFERENCING EVEN IN URBAN AREAS. NEVER MIND THE LACK OF ACCESS AND RURAL AREAS. AND IN THIS SITUATION IT COULD. PROVE TO BE EXTREMELY HARMFUL. BLACKLY THERE WAS NEVER AN ARCTIC OR TEN NEED ARMORED THAT WOULD SUPPORT AN OFFICIAL CHANGES. IN FACT IN SUNDAY NEW YORK TIMES BIG STATES THE AVENUE FOR COUPLE PLUS HAS NOT MATERIALIZED. AND WHILE THE REST OF DRAWING BLOOD ARE NOT AS SEVERE AND OTHER FORMS THAT HAVE HERE THEY ARE VERY REAL. AND THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF A NURSE WHO CAN MONITOR BLOOD DONORS BUT THEY'RE TRAINED ABILITY TO JACKSON YOU FOR EMERGENCY CARE IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

BUT ALWAYS COMING BACK TO THE CONDITION OF EQUITY CAN WE ENSURE THAT WHETHER IT'S RURAL OR URBAN AND LOW INCOME AREAS AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVE ACCESS TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TALK TO A DOCTOR AND TALK TO A NURSE SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TO INSURE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE.

OTHER AILMENTS OR OTHER- AMONG OTHER DISEASES AS OF LATE EDITION ECHO ECHO THERE WILL STILL BE HERE AND WE NEED THAT THOSE ACTS AS WELL SO BLOOD DONATIONS CAN BE SAFELY DONE EVEN AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND I APPLAUD THE WORK OF OUR BLOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE AS THEY CONTINUE TO ADJUST AND AS I SAID EARLIER THIS BILL IS TO PROMOTE INCREASED ACCESS TO BLOOD BANK SERVICES STATEWIDE AND IN RURAL AREAS IN PARTICULAR. WHAT WE DRAW CLOSER TO RECOVERING FROM THIS PANDEMIC- WE NEED TO BE AGILE I'M PREPARED TO HAVE BLOOD PRODUCTS READY TO RESPOND TO ANY EMERGENCY POSSIBLE AND THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE DATA- OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN THE MIDDLE DEPEND PANDEMIC ABOUT OF HOW MANY AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS AND PINTS OF BLOOD THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT- WITH THIS FLEXIBILITY SO WITH THAT I RESPECT THE ASPEN ITEM.

NAZARIAN I REQUEST RIVERSIDE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO. WALDRON. ELEVEN ZERO BECAUSE ELEVEN VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OF A BROTHER SAT ON THANK YOU MR FONG I THINK IT WAS CHAIR. WE WANT TO- AB FIFTY TEN TWENTY BY MISS FRIEDMAN PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISS WRITTEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO KEY PIECES OF REFORMS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SEEKING MEDICAL HELP BOTH THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT AND THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. WERE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR- RESIDENCE- WHO WERE FACING MEDICAL BILLS AS WELL AS AWARENESS- OF FOR THEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO THEM SO IMAGINE FACING WHAT COULD BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. BEING IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND BEING UNDER INSURED OR UNINSURED AND THEN IMAGINE LATER WHEN THE BILLS START TO ARRIVE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PAY WILL COULD BE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICAL BILLS. AND THEN IMAGINE DEBT COLLECTOR STARTING TO CALL YOU AT ALL HOURS AND IMAGINE YOU'RE NOT BE ABLE TO GET A LONER SEND YOUR CHILD TO COLLEGE BECAUSE OF THESE BILLS. AND THEN. WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT LATER THAT YOU ACTUALLY WERE ENTITLED THE CHERRY CARE ARE ALL ALONG AND THAT CHARITY CARE WAS NEVER OFFERED TO YOU. WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL. MAYBE AT ALL OR IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OR TO LIVE WITH YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS TO FAR TOO MANY OF OUR EXTREMELY VULNERABLE PATIENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. KAISER HEALTH NEWS REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT NONPROFIT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA COULD HAVE. BUT DID NOT PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS. PATIENTS REPORT BEING DISCHARGED AND RECEIVING MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL BUT THAT THEY COULD APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE. WORST HOSPITALS OFTEN SELL PATIENT ACCOUNTS TO COLLECTIONS AGENCIES. WITH WHICH FURTHER NEGLECT TO INFORM PATIENTS THAT THEY COULD APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE. CONSEQUENTIALLY PATIENTS A PHASE NEGATIVE CREDIT REPORTING AND FINALLY COLLECTIONS LAWSUITS. TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN EXISTING LAW AND STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AB TEN TWENTY DOES THE FOLLOWING. IT'S STRENGTHENS STATE ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT OF THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT. BY PENALIZING HOSPITALS THAT DO NOT COMPLY. PROVIDES PATIENTS WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BILLS AND HOW TO APPLY FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID. AS WELL AS CHARITY CARE AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. AND WHEN THE BILL WAS SENT TO COLLECTIONS. IT PROHIBITS HOSPITAL FROM SELLING PATIENT AT. IT EXTENDS ADVERSE CREDIT REPORTING AND COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL ACTION FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AFTER INITIAL BILLING. IT REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS TO CERTIFY THAT THE PATIENT HAS BEEN SCREENED FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE THEY FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THAT PATIENT. IT RAISES THE INCOME LEVEL FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM WEEKS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE LANGUAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING THEIR AMENDMENTS IN APPROPRIATIONS. I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE. NOT ONLY FACING MEDICAL CATASTROPHE BUT OFTEN FINANCIAL CATASTROPHE I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS FRIEDMAN YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES I TODAY I'M GOING TO HAVE WITH US TRACY DOUGLAS WITH THAT SUBJECT LEGAL SERVICES AND MONIQUE MONIQUE DAVIS WHO WAS A PATIENT TO SHARE THEIR- PERSONAL STORY.

I WORK IN A MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP AND HELP PATIENTS WITH THE LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT EXACERBATE THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHAT IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN MY WORK I HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT MISS DAVIS WILL DESCRIBE SO POWERFULLY. MEDICAL DEBT HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS YOU CAN SEND PEOPLE INTO POVERTY THEY CAN LIVE THEIR HOUSING PRODUCTION AND FOR CLOSURE. DISTRESSED DEBT PILING UP IN COLLECTION CALLED WORSE WITH THEIR HEALTH. AND IT WEARS NAY MAY BE FORCED TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY MEDICAL DEBT IS THE LEADING. CAUSE OF CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY. AND QUICKLY. CALIFORNIA HOPPED AND PROVIDE SHARED CARE WHEN THEY COULD AND ALSO NOT TELLING. ABOUT ITS AVAILABILITY. MY CLIENT FIFTY HUGE BILLS- SENIORS WHO HAD MET EMERGENCY CARE FOR NEEDED SURGERY FOR A CONDITION. AT NO TIME DID THE HOSPITAL EVER LET THEM KNOW ABOUT CHARITY CARE. THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH. TO BE REFERRED TO LEGAL AID FOR HELP. ONE BLACK SHE NOT BE. IN ACCESSING JERRY THAT. ARE TO OFFER THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE OPAQUE AND HARD TO GET. IT SHOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE. I THINK IT'S NOT THE ONLY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION NOTICING THE PROBLEM MY COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER LEGAL SERVICES REPORTS JEAN KING ISSUES. OFFICIALS ARE CONTINUING COLLECTION CALLS DURING THE PANDEMIC WE CAN EXPECT THAT MEDICAL DEBT WILL INCREASE. THE TIME HAS COME TO STRENGTH IN THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT SO THAT EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE NINE BENEFIT FROM IT AT THE END IT.

NINE ZERO THANK YOU BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE YOU HAVE NOT NINETY NINE VOTES AND IT WILL BE THE ROLE OF THE BROTHERS ADAM THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MR GABRIEL YOUR TURN AB. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT BABY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO WHICH WOULD IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND SAFETY AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY BY STRENGTHENING THE PROCESS AROUND PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUEST RELATED TO NURSE TO PATIENT STAFFING RATIOS. AS AN INITIAL MATTER LIKE TO NOTE THAT STAFFING RATIOS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PROTECTING BOTH NURSES AND PATIENTS. AS RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN LITERALLY SAVE PATIENTS LIVES WHILE ALSO PROTECTING NURSES FROM INJURY AND ILLNESS. I ALSO KNOW THIS FIRST HAND FOR MY MOM AN EXCEPTIONALLY DEVOTED AND COMPASSIONATE REGISTERED NURSE WHO SPENT EARS CARING FOR EVERYONE FROM NEWBORN BABIES TO ELDERLY CANCER PATIENTS. AS MY MOM TELLS IT THERE WERE TIMES WHERE HER HOSPITAL WAS SO LEAN WE STAFF. BUT YOU WERE THAT EVEN TAKING A QUICK BATHROOM BOY WHAT PART HER PATIENTS ARREST. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S GROWING EVIDENCE THAT IN RECENT YEARS SOME HOSPITALS HAVE SOUGHT TO USE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUEST TO CIRCUMVENT STAFFING RATIOS. THEREBY PLACING PATIENTS NURSES AND THE COMMUNITY AT RISK. AB FORTY TWENTY TWO SIX TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY MAKING A NUMBER OF COMMONSENSE REFORMS TO PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUEST. MOST IMPORTANTLY GIVING OUR FRONT LINE NURSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT I'M CHRIS CRITICAL. POSSIBLE SAFETY DECISIONS. AB FOUR TWENTY TWO ALSO INCREASES TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AROUND THE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY PROCESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE BASIC NOTION THAT DECISIONS WHICH IMPACT PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY SHOULD NOT BE HIDDEN FROM PATIENTS TO THE PUBLIC. BUT ALSO LIKE TO KNOW THAT OUR OFFICE HAS MET WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE APPRECIATE THE CRITICAL ROLE OF CNA IN ESTABLISHING AND DEFENDING STAFFING RATIOS. THAT IS WHY WE'VE ALREADY INCORPORATED SOME OF THEIR HELPFUL FEEDBACK INTO OUR FIRST ROUND OF AMENDMENTS. AND WE REMAIN A 100% COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH A CNA NCHA AN EFFORT TO FIND A WAY FOR THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. IT'S TIME HOWEVER TO MOVE FORWARD AND STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS AROUND PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUEST. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE HEROES HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. AND A BARE MINIMUM WE OWE THEM THE BASIC COURTESY OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE IN DECISIONS. WHICH CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR HEALTH THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS. IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR PATIENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF FIGHTING FOR WORKERS AND SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING SEIU CALIFORNIA YOU NAP ASKED ME THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR MATT WAS A FROM US TO YOU CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEY SERRANO A REGISTERED NURSE AND I FEEL YOU WANT TO ONE ARE AND MEMBER. THANK YOU IT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD AND ASK THE OPERATOR TO OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR THE- OF. TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT SKEWS ME. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CHAIR MEMBERS THAT WAS A ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA THE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO- PERSON JUST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. NURSES ARE ADVOCATES FOR THEIR PATIENTS ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SAFELY VOICE THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING CHANGES TO PATIENT CARE GROUP PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUESTED CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY. OF PATIENT CARE THAT THE PUBLIC EXPECT. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO SET MINIMUM RATIOS FOR NURSE TO PATIENT- BY UNITS- IN THROUGH THESE RATIOS GO THESE RATIOS ARE MANDATED BY LAW- HOSPITALS- BROWN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. SEVENTEEN REPEATEDLY VIOLATED- SAFIR PARLIAMENT'S DUTY TO LOCK UP ENFORCEMENT. THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RECIO DEFICIENCIES REPORTED TO CDPH DURING THAT TIME- AND- SO. WITH A BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YES YEAH YOU SPONSORED S. JUNE TWENTY SEVEN TO IMPOSE FINES OF HOSPITALS BY FOUND VIOLATING STAFF REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIREMENTS. THERE'S A BIG ISSUE RATIOS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE NEWSMAX WELFARE RESULTING IN BETTER PATIENT CARE AND NEEDS PROVISION PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK LAW PUSHED BACK ON THE HOSPITAL'S EFFORTS TO DATE. RATIO THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE TO BELIEVE REQUIRES HOSPITALS ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES THAT IMPACT NURSES STAFFING WITHOUT THE INPUT OF NURSES BEACH PROGRAM BUT COMPLETE A REQUEST RANGE FROM CHANGING THE DESIGNATION OF BAD FROM HIGH TO YOU TO DELIVER TO BAD OR CHANGING THE NUMBER OF INTENSELY NURSES IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT THESE CHANGES CANNOT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CRITICAL CARE THAT NURSES PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE- SOMETHING. AS SIMPLE AS CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF A BAD- IN THE END- IN I. C. U. R. NICK YOU- FROM INTENSIVE CARE INTERMEDIATE CARE WITHOUT THE NECESSARY SUPPORT MEANS THAT OUR MOST CRITICAL PATIENTS. ARE PUT AT SIGNIFICANT RATES. DESPITE WITH THE PROGRAM FOR REQUEST EMPOWER NURSES DAILY BY AND THE CARE THERE'S NO CURRENT. FOR THE IMPACTED NURSES TO VOICE CONCERNS HE BE FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO SIMPLY REQUIRES A PERIOD OF PUBLIC COMMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE NURSES HAVE. OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE CONCERN WITH THESE CHANGES. EIGHTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO ALSO PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY- I HAVING HE TEACH BOTH THESE REQUEST ALONG WITH THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ON THEIR WEBSITE. NURSES ARE OUT FOR THE AND NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE CRITICAL TO PATIENT CARE STATE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BELIEVE THE ROLE OPEN THE BILL IS OUT WITH THE ROLE OF THE BROTHERS ANNA YOU CAN GO ON IF YOU'D LIKE TO NEXT BILL ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WOULD AND WITH THE- INCREDIBLE FOCUS THIS YEAR ON HOMELESSNESS AND THE PRIORITY THAT CALIFORNIANS RIPPED UP PLACE ON SOLVING THIS ISSUE I AM. HAPPY TO PRESENT TO AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD IMPROVE ACCESS TO CRUCIAL MEDICATIONS FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES BY REMOVING UNNECESSARY BARRIERS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US I ACCEPT YOUR AMENDMENTS BEFORE TODAY- BEFORE YOU TODAY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE MEDICAL BENEFIT REQUIRES THAT THE PHYSICIAN APPROVED EACH REFILL EVEN WHEN PATIENTS ARE. ON A LONG TERM COURSE OF TREATMENT TO REDUCE OR RELIEVE SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS THAT CAN OCCUR WITH BI POLAR DISORDER DEPRESSION OR SCHIZOPHRENIA. THESE PATIENTS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO REFILL THEIR ANTI PSYCHOTIC PRESCRIPTIONS- PROVIDE- STUDIES SHOW THAT DRUG ACCESS PROBLEMS AMONG PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS HAVE LED TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDING EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS HOSPITALIZATIONS- HOMELESSNESS SUICIDAL IDEATION OR INCARCERATION. IN CALIFORNIA STUDY FOUND THAT FIFTY SEVEN POINT 9% O THE PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS EXPERIENCE AN ACCESS PROBLEM. LEADING TO A NEGATIVE OUTCOME. REVISING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS WILL HELP INSURE THAT THESE PATIENTS CAN FOLLOW THEIR DRUG REGIMEN. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT PREVENTS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM BEING REQUIRED FOR ANY DRUGS PRESCRIBED FOR THE- TREATMENT OF MENTAL A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL PRESCRIPTION IS. DISPENSED AND THE I HAVE- TWO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. MISSOURINET THIS TO THIS- THOSE WERE IN SUPPORT. YES YES A GOOD OUT NUYS SHERMAN WOODS- IN HEALTHCARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS DR AMOL BERRA AND I'M A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE WHERE I PRACTICE FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN MY AREA OF SPECIALTY- IN DIRECT LINE- WITH THIS BILL- IT'S WORKING WITH THAT THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL- THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BIPOLAR DISORDER REFRACTORY DEPRESSION. YEAH I SEE- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. INCREASE MEANT- THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IF ACCESS TO MEDICATION OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS. NOW AT THE NATION'S THAT FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP THEIR LOVED ONES OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TREATMENT TEAM. WE HAVE ENOUGH CHALLENGES IN THIS POPULATION AB ENSURING MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND REALLY THE LAST THING WE WANT TO ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S DOING WELL IF THEY HAVE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION COME INTO PLAY. THAT DISTURBS- THIS SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME. THAT WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION MEDICATIONS ARE MOVING THE MAINSTAY OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME IN THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO EVERYTHING. AND NOT MISTER. ACT ACCESS TO TREAT S. TREATMENT THAT'S WORKING THAT HARD OUR GOAL AT THE TREATMENT TEAM IS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE CHALLENGING INDIVIDUALS WERE WORKING WITH- NOW AS YOU KNOW IN THE PROVISION IN THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS- ONE A MEDICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED THAT IT WILL YOU REMAIN APPROVED FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. WHY THIS IS CRITICAL YOU KNOW UNLIKE CONDITIONS LIKE HYPERTENSION DIABETES WE'LL SEE RESULTS FAIRLY QUICK. IT MAY TAKE THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS TO REALLY GET A GOOD SENSE OF THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICATION THAT YOU ADMINISTERED SO THAT CONTINUED PROVISIONS OF APPROVAL OUT TO WIN YOUR IS SO CRITICAL. TO REALLY ESTABLISH THAT THE MEDICINES WORKING WELL THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS INTRODUCTION OF MEDICINE AND THEN A MONTH LATER OR TWO MONTHS LATER IT'S NO LONGER COVERED FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION- COULD YOU STRUGGLED ENOUGH WITH HELPING THIS PERSON YOU KNOW- I UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT MEDICINES. ANY KIND OF BEARING- DISTURBANCE THAT RESULTS OFTEN GOING TO LEAD TO SEVEN NINE AND HEARINGS TO TREATMENT. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE TO REMOVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PATIENTS WHO'VE BEEN WHO'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED THE MEDICINE THAT IS. PRODUCING POSITIVE RESULTS. NO I THINK EVERY DAY IN MY- YOU KNOW I. YEAH OUTPATIENT PRACTICE HERE- AT THE U. ALSO IN THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS. EVERY DAY THREE OR FOUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS COME IN YOU. THE CLINICIANS- THE BURDEN OF TRYING TO CONVEY. HAWAIIAN MEDICINE NEEDS TO- CONTINUE JUST THAT FRUSTRATION AND DELAYS IN ACCESSING MEDICINES- IS REALLY A REGULAR OCCURRENCE. SO YOU KNOW WE BILL I MEAN IF WE IMAGINE THAT THERE WERE NO BARRIERS THAT ONCE YOU KNEW THAT A PRESCRIPTION WITH FILLED IN APPROVED AND YOU HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT YEAR WITHOUT QUESTION HE WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS RELIEF STEP PATIENTS FAMILIES CLINICIANS. ARE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW A. B. IN ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS SO CRITICAL YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE LAST. THAT'S A MOTHER I THINK WE I THINK I THINK WE UNDERSTAND I THINK YOU'VE MADE YOUR MESSAGES. BEEN ALLOWED TO GO OUT LOUD AND CLEAR. IS THERE A OKAY I CAN'T CAP SO DO WE YOU KNOW HOW THAT A I- BY COMMITTEE- WILL TAKE PLACE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO THE SECOND SECOND WITNESS. AND I PASS A STOPGAP. THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU. MY NAME IS MAY HAYES JACKSON AND I AM A FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATE. I AM THE CARE GIVER AND PARENT OF AN ADULT SON. JASON JEPSON WHO HAS DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER. I'M ALSO A VOLUNTEER WITH THE SHARED NETWORK. WHERE I SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ALL MIDDLE HELP. AS A PARENT WANTING DESPERATELY TO HELP AN ADULT CHILD THE NEW FOR THE CHALLENGES. OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO FOR MY- FOR WOULD BE- ELEVENTH EIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS TO GET THE MEDICATIONS THAT THEIR DOCTORS THINKS WILL WORK BEST FOR THEM. AS A PARENT WHO HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THESE KINDS OF ISSUES FOR YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THIS SEEMS LIKE A SMALL CHANGE BUT IT REALLY HELPS A LOT. I WANT TO TELL YOUR STORY. WHEN I FIRST ALL MY NEWBORN SON JASON I HAD LOTS OF THOUGHTS ABOUT WHO HE MIGHT BECOME. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE ONE THING THAT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND. THAT WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. JASON HAD A NORMAL CHILDHOOD WE WERE A VERY NORMAL ORDINARY FAMILY SOME POP SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN SAY WE WILL BORING. UNTIL I GOT THE PHONE CALL THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES FOREVER. IT WOULD GET IN. A FEW MONTHS EARLIER HE HAD ENLISTED IN THE ARMY AND HE WAS CALLING ME FROM FORT IRWIN HE SAID MOM GUESS WHERE I AM AND I SAID WELL WHERE ARE YOU. AND HE SAID I'M IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. THAT'S WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SHOCKED TO ARE VERY POOR WE WERE ALMOST PARALYZED AS TO WHAT TO DO. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TRIAL AND ERROR SAID THEN BUT WE KNOW- AND JASON KNOWS THAT HE HAS AN INCURABLE BRAIN DISEASE. WE WERE TOLD FROM THE FIRST HELP GROUPS THAT WE WENT TO. YOU WERE GOING TO NEED AN ARMY OF HELPERS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH JOURNEY. AND THAT IS SO TRUE WE WENT THROUGH YEARS OF TRIAL AND ERROR AS HE WENT THROUGH DIFFERENT TREATMENT AND MEDICATIONS. CHANGING CHANGING MEDICATION CHANGING THE WAY HE TOOK THE MEDICATION. SO THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL THEIR JOURNEY IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO GET SPECIAL PERMISSION TO GET A MEDICATION THAT YOUR DOCTOR SAYS IS NEEDED. I AM OFTEN ASKED WHAT IT TAKES TO MANAGE AND MANEUVER THE OBSTACLES OF MANAGING UMBILICAL. PATIENT TRUST AND HONESTY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL TAKE CARE GIVERS HAVE IN THEIR TOOL BOX AND THE BEST ADVICE THAT I CAN GIVE IS THAT YOU CANNOT DO THIS ALONE AND MY SIMPLE REQUEST TO YOU IS TO PASS THIS BILL SO THAT THE ARMY OF HELPERS LIKE ME. ONE LEFT BACK TO FIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WALDRON WALDRON HIGH. NINE ZERO NINE ZERO THE BILLS OUT AND LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADAM. SENATOR COM MARKER. YOU HAVE A BILL BEFORE CB THREE SIXTY NINE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU IN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE SIX NINE THE STREET MEDICINE ACT. AS THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS I'M WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF EXCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS REGARDING. MANDATORY MANAGED CARE PLAN AND ROMAN APPROXIMATELY. FIFTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN L. A. COUNTY LIVE ON THE STREET L. A. HAS MORE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING. HOMELESSNESS THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE NATION. COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE POPULATION THE HOMELESS DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFER FROM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESS DISABILITY AND PREMATURE DEATH. DESPITE THEIR COMPLEX CARE NEEDS PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE LESS ACCESS TO PREVENT TO PREVENTIVE PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THAT'S WHY ON AVERAGE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE LIFE EXPECTANCIES THIRTY YEARS OR SHORTER THAN THEIR HOUSED PEERS. MOST COMMONLY DUE TO PREVENTABLE AND TREATABLE CHRONICLE CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. RON I COVER FOR TWENTY. MANY OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ARE INSURED THROUGH MEDI CAL HOWEVER EVEN WHEN SHORT 73% OF THEM HAVE NEVER SEEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY BARRIERS STARTING WITH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. WHEN YOU ENROLL IN MEDICARE ALL YOUR INSURANCE CARD WITH THE NAME OF YOUR ASSIGNED PROVIDERS MAIL TO YOUR HOME ADDRESS SO FOR THE HOMELESS THIS MEANS NEVER FINDING OUT. WHO THEIR ASSIGNED PROVIDER IS. EVEN IF THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT WHO THE DOCTOR IS MANY ARE RELUCTANT TO LEAVE ALL THEIR BELONGINGS BEHIND UNPROTECTED AND HAVE NO MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. AND FINALLY WITH THEIR ID CARDS FREQUENTLY BEING STOLEN MANY LACK OF FORM OF IDENTIFICATION AND ARE THUS DENIED ALL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER MEDI CAL. ALL OF THESE BARRIERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE HOMELESS TO ACCESS CARE IN THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE MODEL. SO CLEARLY ARE MAINSTREAM HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODELS ARE FAILING TO MEET TE COMPLEX NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SO RATHER THAN ASKING THE HOMELESS TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES WE NEED TO GO TO THE STREETS AND CARE FOR THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY RESIDE. THERE ARE SO MANY SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY MODELS MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED SOME THAT ARE IN YOUR DISTRICT. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE MEDICAL AND BEHAVIOR CARE TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IN ROMAN AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING TRANSITIONS. ALL CARE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE AND DELIVERED ON SITE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE AVOIDABLE EXPENSIVE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS BY TWO THIRDS SO EXPANDING THEM WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. DESPITE THESE BENEFITS MEDICARE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE STREET AS A LOCATION FOR PROVIDING CARE. SO AB THREE SIX NINE REMOVES BARRIERS TO RECEIVING MEDICAL CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES BY EXTENDING THE MEDIC COW PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALLOWING P. H. TO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES AND REFERRALS. REMOVING ID CARD REQUIREMENT. AND ALLOWING PERSONS THAT. WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICARE BENEFITS OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS BRETT FELDMAN WITH THE STREET MEDICINE INSTITUTE AND DR MAYOR MARY MARTHA C. RTC WITH THE UCLA DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND ASK THE OPERATOR OPEN THE LINES FOR OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SHOW SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. FOR EIGHTY THREE SIX NINE PRESS THE ONE TEN ZERO AGAIN LONDON. ZERO WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE IN THE QUEUE LOCAL TO LINE Q. SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. RICHARD MEMBERS TWENTY DOES NOT ONLY HAVE A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WE HAD PRIME WATER WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO PRIMARY WITNESSES ARE THEY NOT ON THE LINE. WE ARE WE ARE ON THE LINE THIS IS DOCTOR MARQUEES CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT GOOD I'M GOING TO GET TO MY STATEMENT RIGHT HERE SO I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE WORKING NOW YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ABOUT A TOPIC THAT'S VERY DEAR TO ME SO MEDICAL CARE OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. MY NAME IS DR MARY MURPHY FROM A FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UCLA. FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS MY MEDICAL PRACTICE HAS BEEN EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS- I PRACTICE IN THE STREETS ENCAMPMENTS EMERGENCY SHELTERS TRANSITIONAL HOMES. AT THE PROJECT'S ROOM KEY HOTELS REALLY ANYWHERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS ONE OF MY TITLE IS PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF THE STUDENT RUN HOMELESS CLINIC SIX A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD PROGRAM- THAT. HAVE BROAD HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE ASKED TO GATHER WITH STUDENTS RESIDENTS PHYSICIANS WE CREATED OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND PATIENTS- RANGING IN AGE. FROM NINETY TWO TO A NEW BORN JUST TWO DAYS OLD. SO EIGHTY THREE SIXTY NINE IS ALL ABOUT ACCESS THE OVER ARCHING COMPLAIN AMONG OUR THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS IS- THAT WE SEE THEIR COLLECTIVE STORY OF PERSISTENT BARRIERS TO CARE ADDRESS SO WELL. IN THE AB THREE SIXTY NINE BILL ANALYSIS. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE STORY OF ONE OF OUR PATIENTS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE BARRIERS TO CARE AND THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS THE FORTY SEVEN YEAR OLD STREET DWELLING MADE. WITH THAT A DENTAL ABSCESS ON EXAM HE WAS MY LEAST FAVOURITE ALWAYS TO LIMIT DOWN. AFTER PROVIDING ANALGESIA AND BASIC ANTIBIOTICS WE REFERRED HIM TO AN URGENT CARE COMMUNITY DENTAL CLINIC. UPON OUR RETURN ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER TO THAT STREET SITE WE LEARNED THAT THE PATIENT HAD BEEN TURNED AWAY AT THE DOOR. DUE TO NOT HAVING MEDIC CAL ORGANIC CAL. AND NO I NEED TO START THE APPLICATION PROCESS WE LEARNED FROM HIS ONE OF THE STREET NEIGHBORS THAT AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF UNITED CARE. THE PATIENT'S CONDITION WORSENED AND HE WAS FOUND DOWN NINE ONE ONE WAS CALLED AND HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MENINGITIS LIKELY RESULT OF ITS UNTREATED DENTAL PROBLEM. AND THAT'S WHERE HE STAYED FOR A FEW WEEKS AND WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER DISCHARGE. THIS WAS AN INVALUABLE LESSON. FOR THE STUDENTS AND I AND WE GO OUT TO BREAK THOSE BARRIERS AND- LET'S. LIKE HAPPENING. SO THREE SIX NINE DOES DOESN'T. IN FACT THE- FOR THIS. WHAT THE JURY EXPERIENCE OF ONE OF OUR OWN MEADOW STUDENT. SHE HAD A PASSION WITH US. AFTER VISION. AND THEN IN NEED OF COURSE. I SHE HAD NO. NO MEDICARE NO ID. NO ACCESS TO THE REQUIRED DESIGNATED PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE TO REALLY AUTHORIZED REFERRAL FOR OPTOMETRY OR OPHTHALMOLOGY. FRANKLY ENVISION WHAT'S SO BAD THAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT AND STEPPING INTO THE STREET AND GETTING HIT BY A CAR. FORTUNATELY THAT STUDENT ATHLETES ARE STARRY FOUNDER WAITED DRAFTING PROMOTE AB THREE SIXTY NINE. BY WORKING AS A LEGISLATIVE AIDE FOR SENATOR TOM LOGGER IN HERE WE ARE TODAY. SO PLEASE DON'T YET FOR- AB THREE SIXTY NINE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT THE DELIVERY. THE BILL REACHES ITS GOAL OF. PROVIDING THE BEST UNHINDERED. MEDICAL CARE FOR OUR HOMELESS NEIGHBORS. THANK YOU AND WE ARE- HAVE. BRETT FELDMAN ON THE PHONE YOU DID GREAT THANK YOU YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. AT THE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DR WOULD ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND CENTER COME LONGER MONEY GOING TO PRESS HELP MEANT FROM A DIRECTOR THREE MEDIC UNIT U. S. HE AND CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL ST MEDICINE INSTITUTE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD TWENTY FIVE OF WHICH ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND INTERMITTENTLY GO TO THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET IN THE WORLD UNDER THE BRIDGES ARE BEHIND THE DUMPSTERS. WITH THE GOAL OF FIRST DELIVERING HIGH TENDER BOX AND THEN THE TEAM QUALITY HEALTHCARE ON THE STREET YOU WOULD EXPECT IN A BRICK AND MORTAR CLINIC AFTER SPENDING THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS UNDER DIFFERENT FREEWAYS AND RIVER BEDS WITH THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND SHARING THEIR REALITY I'VE LEARNED THAT PART OF THAT REALITY IS NOTICING THAT BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFIT ACCESS. RESEARCH WE CONDUCTED A UFC HAS SHOWN THAT HE 5% OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE INVOLVED IN THAT ACCOUNT OF THOSE IN THE WALLS HOWEVER ONLY ONE FOLLOWED BY THREE MINUTE THAN THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT. WITH THREE AMERICAN HOW QUOTATIONS WERE DOWN 60% AND ONE HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS A DAY AN AVERAGE OF THREE DAYS LAST INCREDIBLY THERE WAS ALSO A 42% HOUSING RICHMOND STREET MEDICINE WITH ADDED TO EXISTING SERVICES. CARE PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THIS WORKED WITH TWENTY FIVE PROGRAM THINK IN CALIFORNIA BUT MANY MORE WHO HAVE NEVER STARTED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE REIMBURSED FOR THEIR WORK THE REASON IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLEAR MECHANISM TO REIMBURSE FOR STREET MEDICINE NOT BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF SERVICE YOU ARE PROVIDING THE BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION WHERE TO DELIVER. A CALL THIRTY DIVERSE SERVICES AWAY FROM PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR DEFINING GRANTS AND DONATIONS TO SUPPORT THE WORK FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN SHORT AB THREE SECTOR THAT BY ALLOWING STREET MATTER CONSIDER YOUR REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES WHICH ARE ALREADY REIMBURSABLE BY RECOGNIZING THE NECESSITY TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE FOR AWHILE GATHER IMPORTANT RESULT OF AB THREE SIX NINE ADELINE PATIENTS DIRECT ACCESS.

YES IF I MIGHT MISS AND NANCY MALDONADO CEO OF THE CHICANO FEDERATION GREAT- MADAM OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. TERRAIN HERE ON THE LINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NANCY MALDONADO AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CHICANO FEDERATION WHICH IS AN ADVOCACY AND SOCIAL SERVICES NONPROFIT ANSWER IF YOU GO COUNTY FOR FIFTY TWO YEARS. I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVAN LOW PEOPLE FOR AB ONE THREE EIGHT EIGHT WHICH IS TO BRING GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO WHAT HAS OCCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHICH HAS ESPECIALLY HARMED UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO REPORT COULD NINETEEN DEATH DATA BUT THAT CODE ON THE STATE'S PUBLIC NINETEEN DASHBOARD. AND TO CREATE A UNIFORM DASHBOARD FOR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECORDING HOLDEN NINETEEN DATA. INCLUDING BACK BUT THE CODE ON COUNTY WEBSITE. ALL FIFTY COUNTIES HELLO WHEN LOVE TO THEIR OWN. IN TRACKING THE VIRUS AND CREATING THEIR OWN DASHBOARD. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO HELP COMPANIES BETTER PREPARE FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE PANDEMIC. I STUDIES HAVE FOUND THE UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PUBLIC SYSTEMATICALLY HARMED BY THE PANDEMIC. BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY COMPREHEND THE DEVASTATING LOSS OF LIFE TO COVER NINETEEN INFECTION WITHOUT TRANSPARENT DATA FROM THE CODE. THE ONSET OF THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CO DATA ONTAP. AND HAVE TAKEN SPECIFIC AIM AT HOW THE CORONA VIRUS HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE BILL WOULD REPEAL NEW INFORMATION ON COPING NINETEEN DEATH. WHICH IS NECESSARY TO ELEVATE THE CONVERSATION FROM HELP WITH THIRTY. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES COUNTIES AND HEALTH PROVIDERS TO GIVE THE DEATH EIGHT AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT BEING PUBLISHED. I AM THAT. TALKING ABOUT DEATH TO BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUBJECT BUT UNDERSTANDING MORE PRECISELY WHAT PEOPLE DIED FROM COLD NINETEEN WILL FURTHER EXPOSE THE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH LEAVES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AT GREATER RISK. THIS ISN'T ABOUT SHAMING PEOPLE ARE STIGMATIZED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS IS ABOUT USING INFORMATION TO SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF CONTRACTING COMPANY NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO BE AT GREATER RISK OF NOT PROPERLY RESPONDING IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC REPORTING. EQUITY IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT CRITICISM. AND THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP HOLD THE STATE ACCOUNTABLE AND HEALTH PROVIDERS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT EQUITY REMAINS AT THE FOREFRONT DURING OUR RECOVERY. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING THAT WE LEARNED VALUABLE LESSONS FROM THE WHAT WILL PANDEMIC AND THAT WE MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT WE NEVER END UP HERE AGAIN. AND HE'LL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL HAVE THE OPERATOR OPEN THE LINES FOR OTHERS IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WILL JUST ASK FOR THEIR NAME POSITION AND ORGANIZATION IF THEY REPRESENT ONE.

AB TWELVE OH SEVEN WILL ESTABLISH THE PATHWAYS THROUGH PANDEMICS TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE WILL BE TASKED WITH ANALYSING LESSONS WE ARE LEARNING FROM THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO NAVIGATE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED ALL OF US UNFORTUNATELY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE BEARING A DISPROPORTIONATE BRUNT OF THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE PANDEMIC- AND AN EQUITABLE AVAILABILITY OF COVERT NINETEEN TESTING HAD DEADLY CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY LATINOS. FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY IN THE BAY AREA FOUND THAT WHITE RESIDENTS WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE TESTED FOR COVERT NINETEEN COMPARED TO LATINO RESIDENTS OF THAT SAME COUNTY. HOWEVER LATINO RESIDENTS WERE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT THE VIRUS. A RECENT CDC REPORT ALSO FOUND THE CALIFORNIA'S AMONG THE FIVE WORST STATES FOR EQUITABLE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. THE REPORT SHOWED THE CALIFORNIA HAS ALLOCATED A SMALLER PROPORTION OF VACCINES TO COUNTIES WITH THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS DESPITE THESE COUNTIES BEING AMONG THE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. RECENT RESEARCH BY UC BERKELEY FOUND THAT IN CALIFORNIA 65% OF LATINOS AND 56% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS REPORTED INCOME LOST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. IN COMPARISON LESS THAN HALF OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED A LOSS OF INCOME DURING THIS TIME. THE NEXT. IS NOT A MATTER OF IF BUT OF WHEN. AB TWELVE OH SEVEN WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A ROAD MAP FOR FUTURE PANDEMICS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR CURRENT RESPONSE.

THAT PREVENTING PLANES FROM DISPUTING CLAIMS ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING MAJOR. WE SIMPLY WOULD LIKE PLAN THEY'RE BUILT ON A MORE EXPEDITIOUS MANNER AND RESOLVE DISPUTES FASTER I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE LAW TO ALLOW REGULATORS TO REQUIRE.

THEM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLAN RADICALLY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN FIFTY TWO AM AT THAT MEN THAT. I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR ENGAGING WITH US ON THIS BILL. HOWEVER IS DRAFTED WE ARE CONCERNED THAT A DELAY FIFTY TWO WOULD UNDERMINE THE HEALTH PLAN TO BILITY TO PROPERLY AND THOROUGHLY REVIEW CLAIMS. A CURRENTLY HELPING HOOSIERS AT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS TO ANALYZE REVIEW. AND PROBABLY GET A CLAIM. THIS BILL WOULD CUT BACK TIME IN HALF. BY REQUIRING A PLAINTIFFS WE IN THIS PRICE THAT INTO TWENTY DAY. WITH THAT ARBITRARILY. THE TIME FRAME HEALTH PLAN A CLEAN WITHIN TWENTY DAYS ONE. HAMSTRING HELP AND THE BILL. TO RIGOROUSLY REVIEWED THE SUBMIT A CLAIM. IN COULD UNINTENTIONALLY LEAD TO RUN ITS CLAIMS BEING PAID WHEN NOT WARRANTED. A ALMOST WE TO AND I. AND THEN COSTS FOR PLAN INSURERS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT NOTE THAT AT LEAST THIRTY SIX STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY CURRENTLY ALLOWED PER THIRTY DAY DEADLINE FOR PROFITING IN PAYING CLAIMS. ANY FURTHER NOTE THAT THE NEW AND NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL STATE ALLOW BROUGHT TO FORTY FIVE DAYS A CLIENT. WE'RE ALL CONCERNED A DEAL ON TWO. OCT UPDATED THAT SHORTENING AMOUNT OF TIME FOR HELPING INSURANCE PROP WITH THE CLAIM. WILL CREATE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FAR CONTRACTED DELEGATED ENTITIES. ARE CONTACT DELEGATE IT MAY NOT HAVE THE OPERATIONAL FAMILY PROFIT DECLINE UNDER THE PROPOSED UNDER PROPOSED- SHORTEN TIME FRAME OUTLINED IN THE BILL. THE COULD FORTY HELPING THE MEASURE TO BRING ON THE STAFF TO HELP THE CONTRA DELEGATED ENTITIES PROPERTIES KIND WHICH WILL LIKELY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE- ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR HEALTH PLAN. ADDITIONALLY ONE FIFTY TWO SOUTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURERS PAID THE HIGHEST INTEREST HEALTHY THE LATE PROPERTY IN PAYMENT PLANS IN THE COUNTRY. AND BE THE FIRST HAND GOAL ONLY INCREASE THAT THE THAT THE CLAIMS PROCESSING TIME FRAMES. ARE SHORTENED LEAD TO EVEN MORE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WITH THE PLAN. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ELEVEN FIFTY TWO UNLESS IT IS AMENDED. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DOCTORS OFTEN SPONSORS. RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ZERO SECOND WITNESS IS. I REMEMBER WATCHING IT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY.

WE DID HAVE BEEN TOPPLED CONVERSATION BUT THE AUTHOR AND STAFFING NEEDS DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THOSE UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION.

TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES. ALBUM BETTER ROUTE. THE ULTIMATE OF THE JOB IN MANY PRESS. TO ENSURE A SMOOTH SEAMLESS. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE THINK SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL AND REQUIREMENTS INSURANCE IMPLEMENTED SEPARATE PAYMENT PROCESS FOR ANY CLAIM THAT IT'S PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPROVED OR CONTRACTED CURRENT REVIEW PROCESS. IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT OBLIGATED PLANNERS OR TO PAY ANY CLEAN EVEN IF THEY'RE EVEN IF IT INCOMPLETE I WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONTESTED OR DENIED. THE PROVISION COMPLETELY IGNORE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY LEGITIMATE REASONS LIKELY MIGHT BE COULD HAPPEN AND IT OR DENYING. THAT GO WELL BEYOND HAVING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR CONCURRENT REVIEW PROCESS IN PLACE. FOR EXAMPLE A CLEAN MIGHT BE IMPROPERLY COLLUDED OR MISSING THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. ACCURATELY PROCESS AT. AB ELEVEN SIX GETS THE FACTORED REQUIRED MAINTENANCE. PAID THE CLAIM ON THE FRONT IN. THE CHURCH BUT THEN HOW TO REACH ANY UNNECESSARY CLAIM PAYMENT AFTER THE FACT THIS WOULD CREATE A VERY.

BEING IN A VARIETY OF NURSING ROLE YOU KNOW KILL NURSING FACILITY PROVIDING IT ALLOWED ME TO WITNESS THE BIRTH HAND HOW THE ROLE OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS. BUT DEMAND FOR THEIR INTENDED IMPEACHMENT INDICATE BEING. NURSING FACILITY OPERATIONS BECAME VERY APPARENT AND CHALLENGING AT THE. TIME IN MY OPINION. WELL THE MEDIC DIRECT IS CONSIDERED A CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP IN TERMS OF. MEANINGFUL GUYTON DIRECTION AND- ALL RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DELIVERY OF CARE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FISCAL LEADERSHIP. HAVING HAS ON TRAINING AS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR IN A FIELD NURSING FACILITY SETTING AND OR REQUIRING CERTIFICATION AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR TO WONDER ABOUT THIS PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

CALLING MINE IS A CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR NURSING HOME. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC SHE LIKE MOST OTHER MEDICAL DIRECTORS WAS FACED WITH PRESSURE TO ADMIT KOBLET PATIENTS TO HIS HIS DISABILITY. BUT MY COLLEAGUES THAT IF YOU SATISFIED WILL SET YOU BACK TWENTY WITHIN A WEEK. SADLY MY COLLEAGUE WAS PROPHETICALLY RIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING HE KNEW WHAT TO DO WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO LIMIT OUTBREAKS HIS DISABILITY. HIS ACTIONS SAVED LIVES.

AS AN EXPERT IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE NURSING HOME QUALITY BECAUSE FORMER NATIONAL INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT LIVE YOUR CHEESECAKE FOR DECADES SENATE COMMITTEES- AGING REPORTS PEER REVIEW PAPERS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE VALUE OF COMPETENT AND ENGAGED MEDICAL DIRECTORS.

TO PANDEMIC IS REMINDED US JUST HOW VULNERABLE WITH NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DEATHS. IN HOMES ON THE HOSPITAL'S DEMANDING ACTIVITY GAUGE MINT OF MEDICAL DIRECTORS OF CLINICAL REGULATORY BIOETHICS IN MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WHOLE BECOME PROJECT. AND BY FEDERAL REGULATION THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING MEDICAL CARE IN THE NURSING HOME. YET MANY NURSING HOME MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE WOEFULLY UNPREPARED TO DO THIS REQUIRING MEDICAL DIRECTOR SHOULD CATION PROVIDE CLEAR RECOGNITION. OF THEIR VALUE AND IMPORTANCE FINALLY CERTIFICATION IS SELF PACED WEB BASED AND DOESN'T REQUIRE AN EXAMINATION. YOUR RESPECT THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE POSITION WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT MOST RESIDENCIA FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS DO NOT PROVIDE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY FOR A DOCTOR TO BE PREPARED FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COORDINATING MEDICAL CARE IN A FACILITY. ALLOWING THE STATUS QUO TO CONTINUE SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE CANNOT TELL YOU ARE BOTH LOCAL NURSING HOME RESIDENTS OR THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY RECEIVED. IN THE WAKE OF THE TRAGIC OUTCOME TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE SIMPLE STEP OF ACQUIRING CERTIFICATIONS. WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT AB. SEVEN FORTY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- MISTER MASON. AT THE US CHAIR- I'D TO THE AUTHOR THERE WAS SOME SUGGESTED LANGUAGE- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS- BY A CH A- IS THAT- IS THIS DO YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. I WAS JUST WANTING WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND IF THAT WOULD BE LANGUAGE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER- AMENDING THAT IN MANY ABILITY. I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT NO NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL. I JUST WANNA I'M SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER. SPECIFICS OF THIS THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO. GIVE YOU THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A MORE SPECIFIC ALWAYS ON STAGE ON PAGE THREE OF THE NLCS. I SEE IT. I THINK THE ISSUE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. WAS THE ABILITY WE WANTED TO ASCERTAIN THAT WHOEVER IS GETTING THIS. WHOEVER BECOMES THE DIRECTOR. IS CERTIFIED OR IS GOING TO BE CERTIFIED WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND THERE IS NO WAY OF WE WANTED PERMANENCY PART OF PART OF THE CHALLENGE PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS ISSUE WITH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND A LOT OF LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. IT'S BEEN THAT. THERE IS A LACK OF COMMITMENT OF DELIVERY OF SERVICE NOT SAYING THIS IS INDUSTRY WIDE. THERE ARE SOME PLAYERS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD SUCH VULNERABILITY. AND THIS PANDEMIC JUST ALLOWED FOR THAT LONG ABILITY TO BE AMPLIFIED IN TO BE SEEN. AND TO BE UNVEILED YEAH. ONE OF AND THIS BILL IS JUST ONE OF. MAYBE ABOUT A DOZEN DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS. OF HOW WE CAN. CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE CARE OF THE AGING POPULATION IN THESE FACILITIES IS AT THE FOREFRONT. OF. WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO AND THAT THE DELIVER THE BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT'S HAPPENED COLLEAGUES IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE CENTERS. MOST OF THEM ARE MONEY MAKERS BECAUSE THEY GET A CERTAIN SET SET AMOUNT FROM THE STATE. AND IT BECOMES A REAL ESTATE VENTURE AT SOME POINT. BECAUSE THEY WOULD RATHER MAKE THE INVESTMENT INTO THE REAL ESTATE PORTION OF THE BUSINESS. AND AT SOME POINT WHEN. THEY'VE MADE THE PURCHASED OR ACQUIRED THE LAND THEY CAN EASILY MANEUVER OUT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE YEAH SO THIS WAS YET ONE MORE STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM THE BUSINESS. THAT IT'S NOT CONTRACTING OUT THAT IT IS HIRING SOMEONE. THAT IS QUALIFIED AND IS CERTIFIED AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AND I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. PROVIDED DIDN'T GIVE COMPLETE ASSURANCE THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE IF I'M RECALLING CORRECTLY I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WAS LEFT. SO I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION SURE I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL- TODAY- I JUST THOUGHT WHEN I SAW THIS LANGUAGE SUGGESTIVE LANGUAGE- THAT. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE STILL HAD QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS AND THEY COULD DO THAT THAT TYPE OF WORK- UNDERSTANDING- YOUR EFFECTIVENESS AS A AS A LEGISLATOR- AND YOU ARE. NOT SINCERE DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS- IS I SEE NO NO NO ISSUE AND SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU- ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE A CAR I JUST HAVE A I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING- MISTER NAZARIAN BECAUSE I THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONCERN- BYE C. H. A. THAT THERE ARE SOME SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT ARE SPECIALIZED MORE IN REHAB REHABILITATION AND THEY'RE VERY SHORT TERM AND SO THEY WERE ASKING I BELIEVE- FOR SOME CONSIDERATION AROUND THAT RECOGNIZING THAT. THAT THEY ARE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BUT THEY'RE NOT NOT A LONG TERM FACILITY SO THEY'RE GOING TO SEE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT- PATIENTS THEIR YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT OR OR SHORT TERM FROM A STROKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO SUB MY I JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FULLY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IN THIS BILL- AND- AND IN THIS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE- THEN THE GOAL OF PROVIDING THE BEST QUALITY CARE FOR SENIOR CENTER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. I AND I AND THE AND THE IDEA OF MEDICAL DIRECTORS THAT ARE CERTIFIED I SAID I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THAT I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH C. H. A. ON THIS LITTLE PIECE OF IT- THERE MAY NOT BE A HUGE THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE AND- THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT'S WE HAVE CREATED THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND I APPRECIATE.

YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT- THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH- DENYING PATIENT. ACCESS THOSE SERVICES OR YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE SERVICES IF THEY HAVE THAT BEEFIT IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE PATIENT HAS- THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM TO MAKE. AN EDUCATED CHOICE IN THEIR HEALTH CARE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT THAT TELEHEALTH APPOINTMENTS IF YOU WITH A NETWORK PROVIDER OR WITH A THIRD PARTY QUOTE RIGHT THANK YOU. AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION- WHAT DOES YOUR DEMO. OF PATIENTS LOOK LIKE DO YOU SEE A LOT OF MEN PATIENTS THAT YOU BELIEVE WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE WITH DEFICIENCY CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL POTENTIAL IMPACT WOULD BE ON MEDIC HOW- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE MEMBERSHIP PAGE AND WE CAN WORK WITH OUR VENDORS TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT- BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE WILL BRING SO- ZERO WAS THERE A MOTION AND THEN LET ME JUST IF I CAN'T EVEN IF YOU CLICKED I DID I JUST WANTED TO SAM TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I'M A LITTLE BIT I'M GUESSING THIS IS PROBABLY WHERE- WHERE- MY COLLEAGUE OF WAS THAT SOME OF HER CONCERN ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE RURAL AREAS A TELEHEALTH- IS REALLY HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER BECAUSE- IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO GET A TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDER- IT'S ALSO THE SAME FOR THE FOR THE CHAIR IT AS WELL. ON THE WAY THAT I SEE THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOESN'T LIMIT LIMIT THAT MAKE SURE THERE'S GOOD QUALITY CARE AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE AND SO ALL THESE. BIG SUPPORT OF THIS TODAY. EXACTLY THANK YOU CAN I MAKE A MOTION. OKAY THE MOTION SEVEN MOTION BY MISTER MAY SECOND BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER SANTIAGO- YES SIGNATURE AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT I ALSO AM A BELIEVER TELEHEALTH. AND THEN I WOULD NOT CARRY BILL TO KILL TELEHEALTH. IT BUT RATHER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY HERE IS THAT THERE IS. THAT IF. YOU CALL- YOUR PROVIDER AND YOU ASK. FOR TELEHEALTH IT YOU ARE. TOLD THAT YOUR CURRENT DOCTOR- IT. IS ALSO AVAILABLE IF THEY- IF THEY PROVIDE TELEHEALTH. AT THAT THAT'S SIMPLY. THE GOAL OF DOING AND- WHAT WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT KANSAS BUILT. A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH THE WITH THE CARE THAT MY AND THEN MY CHILDREN WE SEE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT. AND I'VE I'VE SAID THIS TO THE OPPOSITION AND- AND WE'VE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S- ELIMINATION NOT WORK TODAY. BUT THERE AT THE HEAD THERE IS A TO BE SORT OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE AND BEING ABLE TO. HAVE FILES AND RECORDS- IN THAT YOUR DOCTOR HAS IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A DISEASE. SO IT IS SO IF YOU. IF YOUR CURRENT DOCTOR. OR YOUR. OR YOUR CURRENT- PROVIDER. HEY THE ABILITY TO TELEHEALTH SHOULD KNOW. AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER YOU YOU GO THEIR CURRENT- WITH THE KERN DOCTOR COME. AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE- RECORDS WOULD BE KEPT. CONTINUITY OF CARE WILL BE KEPT AND ULTIMATELY QUALITY OF CARE WOULD BE CAPPED. AND THE AMENDMENTS- SEEK TO CLARIFY. THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING AWAY THAT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT A LITTLE SONG AND I ALSO HAD. AND IT'S BEEN A LONG MEETING ALSO ADDED IN URBAN AREAS TELEHEALTH HAS NOW BECOME MORE IMPORTANT AS WELL. BECAUSE IN. BECAUSE BECAUSE- DURING KOBE WE FOUND OUT THAT. BASIC SERVICES LIKE- PHARMACEUTICAL REFILLS- BASIC CHECKUPS COULD BE DONE VIA TELEHEALTH SO THEY BECOME A LOT MORE IMPORTANT- TO URBAN AREAS AS THEY WERE. AS THEY ARE IMPORTANT- TO RURAL AREAS AND I RESPECTFULLY WITH US TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SALTY. SO WE DO A MOTION THE SECOND- AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT HI WOULD I MAYES.

RESPONDING TO THE CALLS AND WRITING THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY ON. ARE THE PATIENT CORRECT AND IF SO WHO WILL BE TRANSPORTING THE PATIENT TO I GUESS IN THIS CASE. A MENTAL FACILITY WOULD THAT BE A LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THEY'LL BE CONTRACTED WITH A- PRIVATE AGENCY OR WERE THEY TRANSPORTED TO THE SHELVES. ALL ALL ANSWER THAT QUESTION- I THINK THE GOAL OF THIS CRISIS TEAM IS TO REPLACE. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR RESPONDING BUT IF THERE IS A NEED TO TAKE SOMEBODY TO THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE THE LOCAL. PARAMEDICS HERE SO INSIDIOUS SACRAMENTO WE DON'T CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER OUTSIDE AGENCY IT'S THE CITY OF. SACRAMENTO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS THAT. PARAMEDIC UNIT. I THINK THAT THAT'S THE NOTION THAT THAT PART WOULDN'T CHANGE INSTANCE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SWORN PEACE OFFICER. I FELT. IT IS THAT CORRECT AND MR NANDO'S. YES YES THAT IS CORRECT WHERE OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THESE SITUATIONS BE DE ESCALATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THEN HAVE TRAINED YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THOSE PEOPLE TAKE IN SOMEBODY BUT IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL NEED FIX A CHANGE THE DANGEROUS SITUATION OR SOMEBODY HAS HEALTH ISSUES THAT REQUIRE CENTS NEMS RESPONSE THEN WE WOULD STILL USE THOSE- THAT PERSONNEL.
