BEFORE IS CURRENTLY THE LOWEST RANK STATE EARNING CONSISTENT SCORE OF THIRTY FOUR BY THE US PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP. ON CALIFORNIA'S E. BUDGET WEBSITE IT IS NOT AS TRANSPARENT AS AND IS ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AS IT COULD AND SHOULD BE. THE WEBSITE PROVIDES AN UNFRIENDLY USER INTERFACE WHICH DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND CONTAINS NO GRASS OR SPREADSHEET FORMATS. THE BUDGET WEBSITE IS ALSO MISSING IN A RAINY DAY INFORMATION REGARDING HOW MUCH MONEY STATE RECEIVES FROM TAX REVENUE ETCETERA. CALIFORNIANS. WHAT? VERY MUCH CALIFORNIA'S WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEIR GOVERNMENTS IS SPENDING AND WHERE IT IS SPENDING IT IN EASILY ACCESSIBLE FORMAT. CALIFORNIA'S OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR WITH HOPE PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY TO CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT AND TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. HOME TO SILICON VALLEY OF COURSE OUR STUDENTS CONSIDER TO BE THE BEACON OF INNOVATION AND THE MODERNIZATION OF CONNECTING PEOPLE INFORMATION IN OUR MODERN ERA. SO IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT CALIFORNIA'S WEBSITES NEAR THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT ARE BEING PIONEERED IN OUR STATE. IN MARCH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE THE U. S. PUBLICAN INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP RELEASED THEIR ANNUAL FOLLOWING THE MONEY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND OHIO EARNED THE NUMBER ONE TRANSPARENCY RANKING IN THE COUNTRY FOR PROVIDING ONLINE ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING DATA. OHIO'S ALSO PROBABLY FEATURED IN THE REPORT AFTER CLIMBING FROM FORTY SIX TO FIRST IN SPENDING TRANSPARENCY AS RESULT OF TREASURE JOSH MANDEL'S RELEASE OF OHIO CHECKBOOK DOT COM. CALIFORNIA AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IS CURRENTLY THE LOWEST RANK STATE ONLINE TRANSPARENCY. IN AB TEN FIFTY TWO WOULD SIMPLY MODIFY ARE FISCAL SYSTEMS TRANSPARENCY COMPONENT TO ACQUIRE THIS IS TO BE MORE INTERACTIVE SEARCHABLE AND REGULARLY UPDATED. MUCH LIKE OHIO'S IS. LAST WEEK GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN UNVEILED TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET PLAN I'D CALLED FOR A HUNDRED NINETY POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING. WHICH SECTION OVER A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE SENSHI SINCE HE GAINED OFFICE IN TWENTY TEN. IN ADDITION A TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED ADDITIONAL TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW TAXES AND LAST YEAR AS WE ALL WELL KNOW. THIS BODY ARE ALL THOSE A SLIM MARGIN BARELY PASSED THE FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR. NEW GAS AND CAR REGISTRATION TAX SO IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT WE MOVE IN A MORE TRANSPARENT. DIRECTION TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THIS YOU KNOW EXTRA REVENUE EXTRA TAX FUNDS ARE BEING EXPENDABLE SPENT. AND ALLOW THEM TO SEE A BREAKDOWN ONLINE EASILY SEARCHABLE AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE. THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF THE HARD WORK OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW. COMMITTEE WHERE I TOOK ALL OF THEIR AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL ENJOYED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL IS ALL SAID OUT OF. VERY MINOR INEXORABLE COSTS BUT WOULD PROVIDE A HUGE RETURN TO TAXPAYERS. YOU THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER OF THE PURSE STRINGS IN THE ABILITY TO SPEND CALIFORNIANS MONEY. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT OUR WEBSITE ACCURATELY REFLECTS WHERE THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND SOCIAL FORMAT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. OTHERS BILLS ENTIRELY BIPARTISAN THAT WE CAN ALL MEMBERS TO DATE OTHERS EXTREMELY MINOR COSTS AND THERE'S A MASSIVE RETURN TAXPAYERS WITH THE STATE OF OHIO TO THIS AS I MENTIONED THEY WENT FROM FORTY SIX AND TRANSPARENCY NATION. TO NUMBER ONE AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY HERE IS VERY PROUD OF MANY OF THE THINGS ARE IN THE BUDGET MAIN MANY OF US HERE PROBABLY LIKE AND. THAT TO CHANGE SOME ITEMS IN THE BUDGET. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE GIVE CALIFORNIANS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR BUDGET WORKS AND WHERE THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT WITH THAT AYE AYE URGING AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WE ESTIMATE MINOR AND ABSORB WILL COST FOR MULTIPLE STATE ENTITY. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION FOR MISTER BIGELOW AND ASSEMBLY AND BY MR FUNG AND THE CHAIR HAS RECOMMENDED A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE.

WITHOUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER ALLEN AYE YEAH YOU KNOW I I SIT ON THE NUMBER OF THE COMMITTEES AND WE DO SEE YOU KNOW A BUNCH VERY AGENCIES TRYING TO TO MODERNIZE IT AND YOU KNOW. MAKE THEMSELVES BETTER AND AND MORE STREAMLINED I CAN TELL YOU THAT UNFORTUNATELY I IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE YOU COULD ASK ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAVID CHIU WE'VE HAD WE'VE GOT AROUND AROUND ABOUT THESE THINGS AND HE IS OF A OF AN EQUAL MIND. THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO NEED OUR OUR WEBSITES YOU MORE TRANSPARENT MORE SEARCHABLE EASIER FOR CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS BUT THAT'S TALKING GENERAL IT LET'S JUST TALK SPECIFICALLY THIS IS ABOUT CALIFORNIANS MONEY. CALIFORNIANS REALLY YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEE WHETHER MONEY SPENT EVERY SINGLE LINE ITEM NOW OHIO DID THIS AND NOW THEY'RE NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR TRANSPARENCY. IF EVERYONE HERE IS PROUD OF THE VOTES THEY'VE CAST WITH THE BUDGET LOOKS LIKE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS OF WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET YOU SHOULD ALSO WILL SHOW THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE EASIEST FOR A POSSIBLE. I UNDERSTAND HIS CALLOUS UNDERTAKEN SOME EFFORTS TO TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY INSURE THAT THEY THEY FINISH THOSE EFFORTS AND THE LEGISLATURE MAKES ITS INTENT VERY CLEAR. THAT AS THERE ARE EXTREMELY MINOR INEXORABLE COSTS HERE AND SUCH A MASS RETURN TO TAXPAYERS THAT TRANSPARENCY IS OUR GOAL THE LEGISLATURE WITH OUR BUDGET.
