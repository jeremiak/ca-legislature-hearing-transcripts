01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:42.139 region:rollup2
DAYS FREE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:43.573 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.008 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.276 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.610 region:rollup2
TAKEN PLACE TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:48.745 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.347 region:rollup2
.

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:52.849 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT IT'S

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:55.051 region:rollup2
HORRIFIC.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:57.153 region:rollup2
BUT THIS BILL.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:59.189 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE PREVENTED THAT.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:00.557 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MINERS

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:03.026 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST SCHOOL

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:04.694 region:rollup2
SHOOTING THAT YOUNG MAN NOT ONLY

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.996 region:rollup2
DID HE TAKE WEAPONS THAT WERE

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:07.164 region:rollup2
NOT HIS OWN WERE NOT REGISTERED

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.565 region:rollup2
TO HIM.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
HE WASN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:12.636 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:14.905 region:rollup2
SEOUL THIS TYPE OF BILL I JUST I

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:17.073 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO USE.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.707 region:rollup2
THAT SCENARIO AS THE REASON FOR

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.775 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:20.710 region:rollup2
.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:23.013 region:rollup2
THIS

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:25.248 region:rollup2
SAME EXACT BILL WAS VETOED BY

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.950 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.984 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A GUN VIOLENCE

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.252 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER HAD ALREADY

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:29.819 region:rollup2
BEEN SIGNED BY HIM ONE THAT I

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:32.088 region:rollup2
THINK WAS.

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.590 region:rollup2
.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:35.525 region:rollup2
MORE NARROW.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:36.826 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS BILL CAME FORWARD

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
AGAIN LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:41.932 region:rollup2
SAID IT WAS TOO SOON TO EXTEND

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:43.266 region:rollup2
IT. I'M WITH WHICH I AGREE.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:45.468 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO THE

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:47.170 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE WE CAN COLLABORATE

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:49.172 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS DO A BILL TOGETHER.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.273 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:52.742 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PERSON

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:55.145 region:rollup2
IN THIS ROOM WHO DOESN'T.

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:56.746 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.648 region:rollup2
FIND A WAY TO STOP THESE TYPES

01:01:56.746 --> 01:02:00.383 region:rollup2
OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING.

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:01.685 region:rollup2
BUT WHENEVER ANYBODY SAYS WE

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.053 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:05.021 region:rollup2
USUALLY MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.522 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO.

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.691 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY END UP DOING

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:09.226 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:10.293 region:rollup2
COMES TO MIND AND SEEMS LIKE IT

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.928 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IN THIS

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.729 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE I'M NOT

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:14.564 region:rollup2
CONVINCED THAT IT IS.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:17.801 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:18.535 region:rollup2
YOUR NO VOTE.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.270 region:rollup2
MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE

THIS ISSUE THAT HITS VERY CLOSE

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:26.710 region:rollup2
TO HOME FOR ME.

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:28.311 region:rollup2

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.546 region:rollup2

HEMA.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:33.850 region:rollup2
WE HAD A SIMILAR. INCIDENT

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:35.619 region:rollup2
WHERE LIKELY NO STUDENTS WERE

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:37.053 region:rollup2
KILLED BUT WE HAD A GUN THEN. GO

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:38.722 region:rollup2
THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD SHOOTING

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.689 region:rollup2
UP HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:41.524 region:rollup2
AND THEN GOING ON TO A SCHOOL

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.526 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:44.461 region:rollup2
RAMMING THE FENCE DOWN.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.395 region:rollup2
AND THEY GO IN THERE AND

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:46.963 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SHOOTING IN THE

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:49.199 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:49.366 region:rollup2
AND YOU ABOUT FOR THE HERO WAS A

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:51.935 region:rollup2
AM.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:53.837 region:rollup2
OF TEACHERS AND STAFF THERE

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.338 region:rollup2
THAT DAY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:56.539 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:58.942 region:rollup2
DIRE SITUATION I GREW UP.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:03:00.043 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.511 region:rollup2
IN A SMALL COMMUNITY NOT VERY

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:02.846 region:rollup2
HARD FROM NOT VERY FAR FROM

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.648 region:rollup2
LENDERS TIES SCHOOL WHICH WAS

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:06.449 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:07.017 region:rollup2
VERY FIRST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.418 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HISTORY I MEMBER

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.252 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:11.287 region:rollup2
YOU THE FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.590 region:rollup2
THAT HAD.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:15.258 region:rollup2
FRIENDS. YOU KNOW WHOSE FAMILY

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:17.227 region:rollup2
HAD GONE THROUGH THAT.

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:18.895 region:rollup2
AND NOBODY WANTS TO EVER BE IN

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.963 region:rollup2
THAT SITUATION I THINK WE ALL I

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:21.931 region:rollup2
FOR ONE BELIEVE WE DO NEED TO

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:24.067 region:rollup2
TAKE ACTION.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:26.202 region:rollup2
TO HELP ENSURE THAT THESE

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:27.404 region:rollup2
THINGS DON'T HAPPEN.

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:29.472 region:rollup2
TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:32.175 region:rollup2
PREVENT THEM FROM HAPPENING.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:34.177 region:rollup2
BUT ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS HOW

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:36.112 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEING TEED UP TODAY AS

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:37.881 region:rollup2
IS THIS IS THE.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.348 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SOLUTION TO THAT.

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:40.684 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:42.018 region:rollup2
.

01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:43.520 region:rollup2
ALMOST SAID HEY IF YOU'RE NOT

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:44.454 region:rollup2

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.622 region:rollup2
WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:47.357 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR POLICY MEASURE THAT

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:48.658 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT WELL INTO.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:50.860 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ACTION THERE'S MANY

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.695 region:rollup2
THINGS WE CAN DO.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:53.463 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE AN

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:55.265 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TOOL.

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.867 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:59.202 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE ENFORCED.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.704 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF GRANTED TO HIM OF

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.472 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT HAD A RESTRAINING

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:04.708 region:rollup2
ORDER AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE HAD

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:05.975 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FIRED ON HIS NEIGHBORS.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.410 region:rollup2
AND SO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:09.479 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.081 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT. THE DA

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:13.283 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO GET A RESTRAINING

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:15.685 region:rollup2
ORDER AGAINST HIM.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:17.754 region:rollup2
HE TURNED IN ONE HANDGUN.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.422 region:rollup2
TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF.

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:20.824 region:rollup2
BUT GUESS WHAT IN THE MEANTIME

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:22.525 region:rollup2
IN THE EIGHT MONTHS SINCE HE HAD

01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:24.027 region:rollup2
THAT RESTRAINING ORDER.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:26.162 region:rollup2
HE GOT OTHER GUNS E ACTUALLY

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.797 region:rollup2
BUILT HIS OWN GUN.

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:29.132 region:rollup2
ANY HAD OTHER GUNS HE DID TURN

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.767 region:rollup2
IT AND NOBODY BOTHERED TO

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:33.737 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GO AND ENFORCE A

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:35.271 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER SO LET'S NOT.

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:36.573 region:rollup2
STANDARD SALE IF WE PASS THIS

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:38.041 region:rollup2
BILL WE'RE GONNA STOP THE SEAS

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.975 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING WE

HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:42.779 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO

COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE.

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:59.662 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACTUAL HISTORY

OF DOING VIOLENT THINGS WHO HAVE

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:03.500 region:rollup2

THEY TAKE THE GUNS AWAY.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.576 region:rollup2
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT. IN

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.177 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN MENTIONED MANY MANY

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.779 region:rollup2
TIMES OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:17.046 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:19.282 region:rollup2
THAT WE STILL HAVE THIS HUGE

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:20.850 region:rollup2
BACKLOG WITH THE APP'S PROGRAM.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:22.185 region:rollup2

DONE.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.490 region:rollup2
SO WHERE IS THE DEMAND ON

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:29.092 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON THESE

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.760 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AGENCIES WHO ARE

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.594 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS JOB OF

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.863 region:rollup2
GETTING THE GUNS AT A DANGEROUS

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.697 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.999 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE WITH

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:37.467 region:rollup2
THIS BILLS IT DOES BROADLY

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:39.068 region:rollup2
EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT

CAN GO IN AND. AND GET AN EX

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:42.038 region:rollup2
PARTE AGAIN EX PARTE MEANS YOU

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.706 region:rollup2
DON'T GET TO COME IN TO DEFEND

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.941 region:rollup2
YOURSELF.

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.408 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T GET TO COME IN AND

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.011 region:rollup2
TELL THE JUDGE WHY YOU

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:49.479 region:rollup2

YOU THAT DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.991 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE MADE IT.

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:03.226 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WAS SAY

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.928 region:rollup2
A FAMILY MEMBER OR A LAW

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:06.129 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:07.430 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GET THESE RESTRAINING

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.865 region:rollup2
ORDER SO WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.234 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT INTRUSION ON

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:12.502 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S. RIGHTS.

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:13.837 region:rollup2
AND WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:15.371 region:rollup2
AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:17.373 region:rollup2
HAVE A HISTORY.

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:19.075 region:rollup2
OF COMMITTING CRIMES.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:20.477 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG DEFICIT I THINK WE

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.911 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED I THINK IT'S TIME THAT

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.513 region:rollup2
WE.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:25.148 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE SECURITY AT OUR SCHOOL

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.916 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:28.117 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF SAID TO ME WELL YOU

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:29.219 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY HAD SCHOOL OFFICERS AT

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:31.354 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES AND IT

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.488 region:rollup2
DIDN'T STOP ANYTHING WELL.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:34.090 region:rollup2
WE HAD RESTRAINING ORDERS IN

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.859 region:rollup2
PLACE AND IT DIDN'T STOP.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.160 region:rollup2
EVERYONE EITHER SO WHAT THAT

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.094 region:rollup2
TELLS ME IS THAT THERE'S.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.129 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:41.097 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:43.032 region:rollup2
IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE ALL ONE

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:44.400 region:rollup2
POLICY OBJECTIVE IS THE ONLY WAY

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:45.702 region:rollup2

VIOLENCE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.505 region:rollup2
THINGS WE CAN DO. AND I THINK

THAT'S A SUBJECT HIGHLY TO

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:14.183 region:rollup2

ON ON THE FLOOR WHO ACTUALLY HAS

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF OBTAINING EX PARTY

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:45.281 region:rollup2

IN ADDRESSING THIS THAT I'VE

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:58.227 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEEN RESTRAINING ORDERS

01:09:56.259 --> 01:10:00.697 region:rollup2
AND EX PARTY RESTRAINING ORDERS

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:02.098 region:rollup2
WHERE GUNS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.699 region:rollup2
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:05.168 region:rollup2
THREATENING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:07.637 region:rollup2
AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN IN THOSE

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:11.007 region:rollup2
CASES. THAT VIOLENT ACTS WERE

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:13.443 region:rollup2
PREVENTED DO THEY WORK ALWAYS NO

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:15.678 region:rollup2
OF COURSE NOT THERE IS NO ONE.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:17.080 region:rollup2
WAY THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:19.582 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE DOING

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.584 region:rollup2
ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:24.420 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO EX PARTE

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:26.222 region:rollup2
ORDERS THERE IS DUE PROCESS IT'S

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.724 region:rollup2
NOT THAT THERE'S NO DUE PROCESS

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:30.626 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN A JUDGE SEES A

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:31.160 region:rollup2
SITUATION. WHERE IRREPARABLE

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:33.463 region:rollup2
HARM IS THREATENED IN THE

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.231 region:rollup2
MOMENT?

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:38.234 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:40.603 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T WE WANT OUR JUDICIAL

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:43.239 region:rollup2
OFFICERS TO HAVE THAT DISCRETION

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:45.508 region:rollup2
TO ENTER INTO INTO TO TO.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:47.677 region:rollup2
MAKE IN ORDER.

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:49.645 region:rollup2
AND THEN WITHIN A VERY SHORT

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:51.481 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME THERE FIRST OF

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:53.783 region:rollup2
ALL THERE IS A HEARING.

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:55.351 region:rollup2
WHEN THE EX PARTY ORDER HAPPENS

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:58.755 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE IS QUICKLY

01:10:55.351 --> 01:11:00.123 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THAT A HEARING WHERE

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.858 region:rollup2
ALL PARTIES ARE ALLOWED TO COME

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:03.059 region:rollup2
IN AND ARGUE THEIR CASE. AND

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.894 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:06.429 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE ORDER ENDS VERY

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:08.564 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WHEN THE JUDGE HEARS

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:10.566 region:rollup2
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:13.169 region:rollup2
BUT WE SHOULD ALLOW OUR JUDICIAL

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:16.305 region:rollup2
OFFICERS TO HAVE DISCRETION OVER

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:17.907 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE SO THAT IN THOSE

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:19.408 region:rollup2
LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTANCES

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:21.043 region:rollup2
WHERE A VIOLENT ACT CAN BE

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:23.045 region:rollup2
STOPPED.

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:23.646 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE WAY WE CAN DO THAT

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:28.384 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHED THAT I URGE YOUR

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:29.352 region:rollup2

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:40.029 region:rollup2
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS TO TING

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.464 region:rollup2

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:02.552 region:rollup2
THE FREEDOM WHAT HAPPENS.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.853 region:rollup2
AS A GRANDMOTHER AND.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:05.688 region:rollup2
AFRAID EVERY TIME MY GRAND

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.956 region:rollup2
CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:09.192 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:10.493 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE AFRAID ALSO.

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:12.295 region:rollup2
AND SURELY THIS IS A AN

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:14.463 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY LARGE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:14.931 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FACE.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.499 region:rollup2
AND WE DIDN'T GET HERE

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.633 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.602 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:21.037 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:22.805 region:rollup2
AND EVERYTHING YOU MENTIONED IS

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:25.007 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:27.410 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:28.845 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE HAVE ISSUES OF VALUES.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:31.214 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HATRED THAT PEOPLE

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.981 region:rollup2
PROMOTE ON TELEVISION THAT COMES

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:33.583 region:rollup2
EVEN OUT OF OUR ELECTED

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:35.918 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS.

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:37.787 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOLKS WHO DISLIKE OF THE

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:39.722 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND IF WE THINK THAT THAT

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:41.824 region:rollup2
DOES NOT IMPACT THE CHILDREN. IN

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:43.926 region:rollup2
OUR HOMES AND OUR COMMUNITIES WE

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:45.228 region:rollup2
ARE DELUSIONAL.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:47.029 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS HURTING OUR

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:48.197 region:rollup2
CHILDREN RIGHT NOW.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.099 region:rollup2
AND THE PAIN THEY FEEL WE SHOULD

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:51.500 region:rollup2
FEEL.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:53.402 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH AN

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.771 region:rollup2
ISSUE LIKE THIS.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:58.007 region:rollup2
IT IS A SMALL ISSUE IN MANY WAYS

01:12:55.771 --> 01:13:00.009 region:rollup2
BUT COULD HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:01.377 region:rollup2
IN A COMMUNITY.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:03.079 region:rollup2
IF WE PREVENT ONE INCIDENT FROM

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.614 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:13:03.079 --> 01:13:06.182 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO BECOME

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:08.050 region:rollup2
THE NORM.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:10.186 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE NORM

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:11.787 region:rollup2
IN MY CHILDREN'S LIVES AND MY

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.823 region:rollup2
GRANDCHILDREN'S LIVES WHAT WE

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:15.391 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ARM OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:17.460 region:rollup2
CREATE BARRIERS AT OUR SCHOOL

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:19.128 region:rollup2
AND MAKE THEM LIKE ARMED CAMPS

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:21.330 region:rollup2
WHERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:23.499 region:rollup2
WE PRIDE OURSELVES AS BEING A

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.268 region:rollup2
CIVILIZED NATION.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:26.702 region:rollup2
AND MOST OF US CAN REFLECT BACK

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:28.804 region:rollup2
UPON WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL THAT

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:30.006 region:rollup2
IS A SAFE PLACE.

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.540 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS ARE THE SAFE PLACES

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:32.975 region:rollup2
WE GO.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.510 region:rollup2
AND SO WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR THIS

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:35.978 region:rollup2
AND I HOPE YOU WILL.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.780 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.315 region:rollup2
ONLY.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.050 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THE EFFORTS TO

01:13:39.315 --> 01:13:43.552 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO WRESTLE WITH THIS VERY

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:45.121 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT PROBLEM THAT WE FACE.

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:46.789 region:rollup2
AND WE CANNOT KEEP WAITING FOR

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:48.491 region:rollup2
THE PERFECT.

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:50.159 region:rollup2
THING TO HAPPEN IN THEIR FULL

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:51.227 region:rollup2
VOICE THE GOOD THAT IS THERE.

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:53.029 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:54.697 region:rollup2
LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AND A LOT

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:56.299 region:rollup2
OF DISCUSSIONS IN A LOT OF

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:58.534 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION. ADDED MAY

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:59.468 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENCE SOME OF US IN

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.703 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT IN OUR

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.971 region:rollup2
LIVES.

01:14:00.703 --> 01:14:03.539 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR THE

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.274 region:rollup2
GREATER GOOD.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:06.609 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE AS I

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.444 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.845 region:rollup2
THAT WERE HAVING.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.580 region:rollup2
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID WHEN THE

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:13.683 region:rollup2
ELEPHANTS FIGHT.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:16.352 region:rollup2
THE BIG WARRIORS THE DEMOCRATS

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:18.721 region:rollup2
THE REPUBLICANS THE PRO NRA THE

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:19.822 region:rollup2
ANTI IN OUR A THAT THIS THAT

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:21.624 region:rollup2
THAT AND WE CAN HAVE THOSE

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:23.426 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AND OUR CHILDREN

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:25.161 region:rollup2
ARE BENEATH THE ELEPHANTS AS WE

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:26.395 region:rollup2
STOP AT EACH OTHER.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.431 region:rollup2
AND THERE AND WE ARE LOSING THEM

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.999 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY.

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:31.567 region:rollup2
I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:33.336 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:34.904 region:rollup2
I'M VOTING FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:36.272 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE ANSWER. BUT IS ONE

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:38.140 region:rollup2
OF THE PIECES IN THE PUZZLE.

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:39.942 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.677 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR.

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:44.080 region:rollup2
I HOPE YOU COME BACK TO WORK TO

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:46.282 region:rollup2
FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.217 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS A NATION WE CANNOT

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:50.152 region:rollup2
TOLERATE A SHOOTING IN OUR

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:53.322 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AE SOME GUN VIOLENCE IN

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:55.057 region:rollup2
OUR SCHOOLS. EVERY WEEK.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.525 region:rollup2
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AND IT

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU I

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:03.432 region:rollup2
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:05.134 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FIRST

ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES I YOU KNOW

WE'VE HEARD.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:19.915 region:rollup2
MANY PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:21.217 region:rollup2
REGARDING GUNS AND FIREARMS AND

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.419 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY I JUST WANT TO THANK

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:24.587 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY FOR AN INCREDIBLY HOT

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:26.122 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL DISCUSSION I THINK

01:15:24.587 --> 01:15:27.089 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.057 region:rollup2
TO ME IS A SIGN OF PROGRESS AT

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.825 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:31.527 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.995 region:rollup2
WE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.963 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ANSWER IS AND AGAIN

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:36.032 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ISN'T.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:37.500 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ANSWER.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.434 region:rollup2
BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.202 region:rollup2
DIEGO SAID IT'S A PIECE OF THE

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:41.904 region:rollup2
PUZZLE.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:43.572 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DO IS

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:45.207 region:rollup2
TRY OUR BEST I KNOW WE ARE

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:46.208 region:rollup2
WORKING HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.443 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THOSE

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.511 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PIECES.

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:50.880 region:rollup2
PUZZLE.

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:52.348 region:rollup2
TO MAKE.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.849 region:rollup2
STREETS SAFER TO MAKE OUR

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:57.119 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS SAFER TO MAKE OUR.

01:15:53.849 --> 01:16:00.089 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES SAFER.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:01.590 region:rollup2
THIS STRUCK ME THE MOST WHEN.

AND.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.629 region:rollup2
PROBABLY LIKE MANY PARENTS

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.963 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH WERE BUSY

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:09.532 region:rollup2

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.733 region:rollup2
TALK TO MY KIDS SO.

01:16:09.532 --> 01:16:11.267 region:rollup2

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:30.886 region:rollup2
IRRESPONSIBLE TO NOT TO.

THEY MAY HAVE TO DO.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:43.299 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS A SHOULD.

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:47.303 region:rollup2
IF THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:48.904 region:rollup2
ON SCHOOL.

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:50.306 region:rollup2

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:52.608 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT NO.

GREATER.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.745 region:rollup2
NO TWELFTH GRADER.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2
NO KINDERGARTNERS.

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:59.315 region:rollup2
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO HEAR FROM

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:00.883 region:rollup2
THEIR TEETH.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:02.852 region:rollup2

RESPONSIBLE AND TO NOT HAVE A

POLITICAL DISCUSSION BUT FRANKLY

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:08.557 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:11.060 region:rollup2
PROTECT YOURSELF.

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:12.962 region:rollup2

LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT ELSE WE

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:27.543 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:28.711 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS JUST.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:30.813 region:rollup2
THE BILL I'M PRESENTING DOESN'T

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:32.047 region:rollup2

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:36.218 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:29.663 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE THEM OUR CHILDREN UNDER

01:44:27.795 --> 01:44:31.265 region:rollup2

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.870 region:rollup2
THREATENING ALLERGY TO A TREE

01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:38.038 region:rollup2
NUTS AND PEANUTS.

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.673 region:rollup2

AND WHEAT.

01:44:45.246 --> 01:44:48.883 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.017 region:rollup2
SEEN ON THE RISE INCREASINGLY

01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:50.851 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AMONG THE LAST

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:53.454 region:rollup2
DECADE AND PARTICULARLY AMONG

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:55.256 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. THEY RESULTS IN OVER

01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:55.823 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EMERGENCY

01:44:58.092 --> 01:45:00.928 region:rollup2
AND THE NUMBER OF FOOD ALLERGY

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:03.230 region:rollup2
REACTIONS REQUIRING EMERGENCY

01:45:00.928 --> 01:45:04.932 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS OR EMERGENCY TRIPS

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:06.667 region:rollup2
ROSE SHARPLY JUST IN THE PAST

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:09.336 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS BY ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:11.272 region:rollup2
PERCENT WE DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:13.440 region:rollup2
WHY IT IS A BIG QUESTION AND

01:45:11.272 --> 01:45:15.509 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IS LOOKING INTO IT. BUT

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.577 region:rollup2
THIS RESOLUTION IS IMPORTANT TO

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:19.046 region:rollup2
INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THINGS

01:45:16.577 --> 01:45:20.648 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD KNOW. FIRST OF ALL

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:23.083 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE PARENTS FAULT IT'S

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:25.152 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THE MOM DID WRONG

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:27.121 region:rollup2
DURING A ANYTIME OF THE CHILD'S

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:29.123 region:rollup2
EARLY LIFE OR WHEN THE CHILD WAS

01:45:27.121 --> 01:45:30.891 region:rollup2
IN UTERO. IT'S ALSO NOT THE

01:45:29.123 --> 01:45:31.525 region:rollup2
CHILD'S FAULT.

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.927 region:rollup2
THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:34.228 region:rollup2
EITHER.

01:45:32.927 --> 01:45:36.463 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING

01:45:34.228 --> 01:45:37.698 region:rollup2
WHERE FOOD ALLERGY ALLOWS YOU

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:39.533 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU PUT THE ALLERGEN ON THE

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.834 region:rollup2
FOOD TO TAKE IT OFF OR BRUSH IT

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:41.936 region:rollup2
OFF FOR JUST SCRAPED AWAY

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:42.770 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE ARE LIFE.

01:45:41.936 --> 01:45:45.272 region:rollup2
THREATENING.

01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:46.874 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS.

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:48.342 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THE BEARER AMOUNT OF

01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:49.877 region:rollup2
CONTACT COULD CAUSE SOMEONE TO

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:51.645 region:rollup2
GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:45:49.877 --> 01:45:53.514 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POINTS OUT JUST A FACT

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:55.316 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOOD ALLERGIES IS SAM

01:45:53.514 --> 01:45:56.750 region:rollup2
HAPPY PANTS AND THOSE EMERGENCY

01:45:55.316 --> 01:45:58.385 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT WE ALL SHOULD KNOW

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:59.954 region:rollup2
HOW TO USE SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS

01:45:58.385 --> 01:46:00.921 region:rollup2
THE STATE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE

01:45:59.954 --> 01:46:02.122 region:rollup2
AND HAVE.

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:03.324 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT AN ASSURANCE THAT

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:04.291 region:rollup2
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE THAT FOOD

01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:05.626 region:rollup2
ALLERGEN IN THE AREA FOR THE

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:07.061 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO'S ALLERGIC THEY BUY

01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:08.762 region:rollup2
YOU TIME AND SOMETIMES THEY

01:46:07.061 --> 01:46:10.598 region:rollup2
DON'T WORK. AND THERE ARE STILL

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:12.433 region:rollup2
FATAL INCIDENCES THAT HAPPENED

01:46:10.598 --> 01:46:13.634 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER THE USE OF ABBY PENS

01:46:12.433 --> 01:46:16.437 region:rollup2
AND BENADRYL AND EMERGENCY

01:46:13.634 --> 01:46:17.905 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION.

01:46:16.437 --> 01:46:19.473 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CURE FOR FOOD

01:46:17.905 --> 01:46:20.808 region:rollup2
ALLERGIES BUT THIS IS SOMETHING

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:22.076 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RESEARCH

01:46:20.808 --> 01:46:22.810 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD BECAUSE IT AFFECTS

01:46:22.076 --> 01:46:24.511 region:rollup2
EVERYONE OF OUR ASSEMBLY
