SOME DEFINITIONS THE INFLATION

INCREASE IN THE PRICE FOR A JAR

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.858

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.427
WELFARE IMPACT OF THE 20%

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:51.597
INCREASE. IN THE PRICE OF A

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.065
GALLON OF GASOLINE. THE US

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.134
BUREAU CENSUS FINANCES THIS

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.604
ISSUE BY USING A WEIGHTED SAMPLE

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.273
OF PRICES WITH THE WEIGHTS FOR

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:01.674
FROM THE THREE YEAR SURVEY OF

URBAN CONSUMER BUYING HABITS.

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.213
FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.514
OF COURSE OUR BUYING HABITS ARE

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.549
DIFFERENT TODAY BUT TO HAVE A

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:11.450
CONSISTENT MEASURE THE WEIGHTS

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.419
CHANGE PRINCIPALLY TO REFLECT

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.954
THE QUALITY AND TECHNOLOGY

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.956
CHANGES OVER TIME. NOT THE

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.291
CHANGES IN OUR TASTES AND

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:20.459
PREFERENCES SO THAT'S A WAY OF

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.062
SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.497
LOOK AT THESE INFLATION NUMBERS.

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:28.267
WITH THE- BIT OF SKEPTICISM

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.402
ABOUT THE OVERALL HEADLINE

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.238
NUMBERS AND DIG DOWN DEEPER. FOR

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.440
THE U. S. THE AVERAGE RATE OF

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.274
INFLATION AS MEASURED BY THE

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.677
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR ALL

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.345
CONSUMERS. OVER THE PAST TWELVE

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.413
MONTHS WAS EIGHT POINT THREE

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:42.748
PERCENT. I BUT IT'S DIFFERENT AS

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.717
WE MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.619
LOS ANGELES MSA WHICH INCLUDES

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.387
ORANGE COUNTY WAS SEVEN POINT

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.722
NINE PERCENT. FOR THE SAN

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.924
FRANCISCO MSA WHICH INCLUDES THE

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.827
EAST BAY IT WAS ONLY FIVE

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:55.494
PERCENT. AND MUCH OF THIS

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.563
DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO THE IMPACT

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.732
OF CHANGES IN SHELTER COSTS AND

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.233
HOW THEY ENTER THE CONSUMER

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.169
PRICE INDEX. SHELTERS

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.671
APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.473
CPI. AND IT IS A MEASUREMENT

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.142
MEASURED AS AN AVERAGE OF RENTS

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.944
PAID BY RENTERS. AND OWNERS OF

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.146
QUICKLY WRAP WHICH IS NOT PAID

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:17.149
BY HOMEOWNERS. AND IS ABOUT 55%

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.484
OF ALL CAT CALIFORNIA

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.020
HOUSEHOLDS. IT IS THE RENT THAT

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:25.825
THEY WOULD PAY THEY. WERE

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:26.726
RENTING THEIR HOME RATHER THAN

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.094
BUYING IT. SO IN FACT THE C.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.829
THAT OVER. AHEAD NUMBER IS MY

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.131
MORE REP. OF THE IMPACT OF PRICE

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:34.266
INCREASES. ON THE APPROXIMATE

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.334
ONE HALF OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:40.006

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.855
SHORTAGE OF CHIPS EASES AND WHAT

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.723
THAT WILL TAKE TIME THE TREND IS

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.758
CLEAR. ENERGY PRICES HAVE

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.393
STABILIZED ALBEIT AT A HIGH

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.029
LEVEL BUT THEIR IMPACT THROUGH

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.498
THE ECONOMY IS STILL BEING FELT

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.033
IMPORTANT IS THE ROLE OF WHAT

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.100
THAT OIL PRICES HAVE IN THE

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.568
PRODUCTION OF FOOD BUT DIRECTLY

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.537
EMPOWERING FARM EQUIPMENT AND

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.340
TRUCKING. AND THROUGH THEIR INFO

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.242
IMPORTANCIA FERTILIZER HIGH

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.377
ENERGY PRICES ARE NOT EXPECTED

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.646
TO DECLINE AS THE WAR RAGES ON

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.449
IN THE UKRAINE. AND THE ABILITY

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.817
OF PRODUCERS ELSEWHERE TO RAMP

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.386
UP PRODUCTION BEING DEPENDENT ON

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.221
INVESTMENT IN DRILLING RIGS. I

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.857
NEVER THE LESS FURTHER INCREASES

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.260
ARE NOT EXPECTED. AND SO THAT'S

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.128
THE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS WILL

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.296
GROWTH GOING TO HAVE HIGHER OIL

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.865
PRICES HIGHER FERTILIZER PRICES

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:42.935
FOR SOME TIME BUT NOT INCREASING

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.937
IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY OVER THE

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.106
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. AIRPLANE

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.441
FLIGHTS REPRESENT OF RECOVERY

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.376
FROM VERY LOW RATES AND THEY ARE

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:51.277
THEMSELVES NOT EXPECTED TO

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.179
INCREASE AT THE SAME RATE GOING

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.880
FORWARD AND SHELTER COST

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:57.216
INCREASES HAVE OUTSTIPPED THE

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:59.118
INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.820
AND WHILE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.888
DUE TO DEMOGRAPHICS. AND POST

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:05.224
CODE THE CHANGE HOUSEHOLD

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.393
PREFERENCES FOR MORE SPACE THIS

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.196
WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD INFLATION

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.864
RATES HIGH OVER THE COMING YEAR.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.232
ABOUT ONE OF THE LARGEST DRIVERS

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.533
OF INFLATION TODAY AS WITH

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.368
POINTED OUT IN THE INTRODUCTION

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:19.405
IS FOOD AND A BIG PART OF THIS

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.005
STEMS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.341
WHEAT. NOT ONLY OUR PRODUCTION

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.076
COSTS HIGHER DUE TO THE INCREASE

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:25.744
IN THE PRICE OF OIL BUT THE

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.179
SUPPLY IS BEEN SERIOUSLY

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.215
CURTAILED. THE LARGEST WORLD

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:32.318
WHEAT PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD ARE

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:34.920
THE US RUSSIA INDIA AND CHINA IN

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.455
THE US AND ELSEWHERE PRODUCTION

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:38.824
IS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE U.

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:43.929
S. ABOUT 8% LITTLE MORE THAN 8%

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:45.164
DUE TO DROUGHT. CHINA DOES NOT

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.199
PRODUCE AND FOR ITS NEEDS IN PUT

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.901
AT THE ON X. AND THE WHEAT

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.336
PRODUCING REGION IN INDIA

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.338
SUFFERING FROM EXTREME HEAT. AND

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:53.739
THE RUSSIAN SUPPLIES NOW BEEN

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.841
CUT OFF. THIS WILL INDUCE A

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.977
SUBSTITUTION TO OTHER GRAINS

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.545
SUCH AS CORN AND RICE AND THEIR

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.480
PRICES WILL THEN INCREASE. IN

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.782
ADDITION TO THE HIGH PRICE OF

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.718
GASOLINE A SHIFT- THERE'S A

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.721
SHIFT IN IN DEMAND TO ETHANOL

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.022
WHICH WILL ALSO INCREASE THE

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.892
DEMAND. AND THE PRICE OF CORN.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.994
THAT BECAUSE- CALIFORNIA'S LARGE

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.163
AGRICULTURAL HE BECAUSE OF

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.598
CALIFORNIA'S LARGE AGRICULTURAL

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.133
INDUSTRY. GOOD PRICE INFLATION

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.469
IS LIGHTLY LIKELY TO BE SLIGHTLY

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:26.972
LOWER. IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.474
INCREASE. THEN THE US GOING

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.676
FORWARD BUT NOT BY MUCH. MORE

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.611
OVER THE SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:34.313
THAT HAVE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.748
RECOVERED FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.449
RECESSION. BY THE SERVICE

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.518
SECTORS WITH THE AVERAGE INCOME

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.254
OF THOSE EMPLOYED IS LOWER THAN

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.156
THE MEDIAN INCOME IN CALIFORNIA.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.292
N. THERE IS A MUCH GREATER

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:47.259
NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.894
OUT OF WORK ON AVERAGE

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.463
CALIFORNIANS SPEND ABOUT 13% A

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.998
LITTLE MORE THAN 13% OF THEIR

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:55.568
INCOME ON FOOD. UP WITH ABOUT

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:56.869
TWO THIRDS OF THAT THE INQUEST

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.938
REPURCHASES LOW INCOME

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.306
CALIFORNIANS WILL SPEND AT LEAST

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:02.875
DOUBLE THAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.176
INCOME. IN THESE ARE THE

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.578
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE FACING THE

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.046
MORE DIFFICULT EMPLOYMENT

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:10.049
MARKETS AND THEY ARE CLEARLY THE

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.718
MOST IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT.

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.687
AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE THE

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:15.921
INCREASING COST OF GOING

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.492
FORWARD. AND WITH THAT I WILL

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:21.594
CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THANK YOU.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.862
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR

00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:26.899
NIKOLSBURG- NOT SURE IF WE HAVE

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.034
DOCTOR SUMNER HERE. YEAH VIDEO

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:31.837
GREAT I THANK YOU. AND PLEASE

ON FOR THE PANEL. DR SUMMER. YES

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:45.317
ABOUT MY AUDIO WE ARE HERE YOU

FOR THIS MEETING WELL GET

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:57.296
STARTED IT AND ASSUME YOU'LL GET

00:14:57.363 --> 00:15:00.132
THE VIDEO UP EUROPE THANK YOU

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.768
ALL RIGHT. AND I'M GONNA USE THE

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.803
FEW MINUTES AVAILABLE TO MAKE UP

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.039
A FEW VERY BRIEF POINTS ABOUT

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:09.008
THE CURRENT BOUT OF INFLATION IN

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.510
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AS WE'VE

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.978
WE'VE JUST HEARD INFLATION IS

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.080
THE WIDESPREAD CONTINUED RATE OF

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.483
INCREASE IN OF THE GENERAL LEVEL

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.853
OF PRICES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:22.621
IN THE ECONOMY. ALL SPECIFIC

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:25.924
FARM PRICES ALL SUCH AS FOR

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.960
EXAMPLE ALMONDS AND ALFALFA TO

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.395
TAKE TO IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:32.164
CROPS A JUMP UP AND DOWN FROM

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.899
MONTH TO MONTH AND FROM YEAR TO

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.801
YEAR. OFFER COMMODITY SPECIFIC

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:38.604
REASONS- LIKE US SUPPLY SHOCK

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.372
BAD WEATHER. OR FOR THAT MATTER

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.574
GREAT WEATHER PRICES GO UP AND

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:45.911
DOWN. ALL BUT THIS FLUX. IN

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:49.148
RELATIVE PRICES ISN'T INFLATION

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.618
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.387
TWO WHAT PRICES ARE DOWN. DUE TO

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.290
LOW OF LESS WORLD DEMAND FOR

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:01.660
COMPLICATED REASONS OF BLOOD

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.496
EIGHT PRICES ARE ARE UP A LOT

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.298
AND THAT'S DUE TO AN OUTBREAK OF

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.434
AVIAN INFLUENZA AGAIN NEITHER

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.568
ONE OF THOSE ARE REALLY

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.204
INFLATION- DEFINED AS WE THINK

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:14.206
ABOUT INFLATION. AND IN

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.342
PARTICULAR OF THE FED FOR

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:19.078
EXAMPLE ATTENDS TO DISCOUNT OF

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:21.180
FOOD PRICES IT WHEN THEY TALK

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:22.848
ABOUT INFLATION THEIR PREFERRED

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.516
MEASURE TO TALK ABOUT INFLATION

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.085
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.921
IDIOSYNCRATIC FLUX IN IN FARM

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.956
PRICES AND FARM COMMODITY PRICES

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.592
IN THE FOODS MOST TIED. CLOSELY

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.362
TIED TO THEM. I WILL ALSO SAY

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:39.098
THAT FOOD PRICES. THAT YOU AND I

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.200
BY IN THE RETAIL STORE ARE

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:44.370
MOSTLY COMPRISED OF LABOR AND

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.238
REAL ESTATE AND ALL THE COSTS

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.407
THAT GO INTO MARKETING. AND OF

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:51.276
THE FARM PRICES OR FOR EXAMPLE A

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.045
RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THAT.

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:56.014
ABOUT 50% FOR MILK WHICH OF FOR

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:57.583
FLUID MILK WHICH GOES PRETTY

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.852
MUCH DIRECTLY TO THE SUPERMARKET

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:01.420
WITH VERY LITTLE PROCESSING.

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:02.888
WHAT WE HEARD A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:06.158
THE PRICE OF WHEAT. AND MOST OF

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.894
US EAT OUR WAY WE CAN THE FORMAL

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.162
PASTA OR BREAD OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:12.698
THAT. AND THE FARM PRICE A WEEK

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.733
IS BETWEEN FIVE AND 10% OF THE

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.602
RETAIL PRICES OF THE GOODS THAT

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.604
HAVE WHEAT IN THEM. AND THAT'S

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.672
SOMETHING TO REMEMBER WHEN WE

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.608
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:25.411
FARM AND WHAT THAT MEANS OF FOR

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:28.347
RETAIL PRICES FOR ALL OF US. BOB

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:30.015
THE COST OF INPUTS FOR

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.517
CALIFORNIA FARMS AND RANCHES

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.252
HAVE BEEN RISING BECAUSE OF THE

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.154
ENGINE IN GENERAL INFLATION

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.922
RATE. AND BECAUSE OF THESE

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.992
IDIOSYNCRATIC ONE TIME REASONS.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.994
IN THESE HIGHER COSTS SQUEEZE

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.196
THE BOTTOM LINE IN FOR SUPPLY

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.365
ADJUSTMENTS. I'M GONNA TALK

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:48.333
ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE A LITTLE

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.202
BIT LATER BUT LET ME MENTION

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.637
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN THE

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:55.307
NEWS A LOT AND THAT IS. ALL HIGH

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:57.042
PRICE OF FERTILIZERS. THEY'RE

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:59.211
TIED TO NATURAL GAS THEY'RE ALSO

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:02.214
TIED. UP ALL THE IMPORTS AND

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.317
EXPORTS. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN WE

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:06.919
TALK ABOUT FERTILIZER PRICES WE

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:09.121
SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE DAY BEGAN

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.757
RISING AFTER YEARS OF FAIRLY

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:15.127
STABLE OF PRICES THEY BEGAN

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.629
RISING IN MID TWENTY TWENTY. AND

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:20.732
WENT AND DOUBLED BY THE TIME WE

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.234
GOT TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:25.270
ONE. ARE THEY RISEN 15% THIS

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:28.674
YEAR ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.709
AFTER THE MIDDLE OF MARCH SO

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.011
THAT IS WE HAD BLACK FERTILIZER

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:35.414
PRICES AT HIGH LEVELS. BUT THEN

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.416
THEY TOOK OFF WELL AT THE TIME

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:39.017
OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.386
UKRAINE. AND THEN THEY'VE

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.188
THEY'VE ACTUALLY STABILIZE THE

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.523
LAST FEW WEEKS SO THEY HAVEN'T

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.326
CONTINUE TO RISE THERE WAS A BIG

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.994
ZOOM. AND THEN OF FLAT AGAIN IN

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:51.129
MOST. PROJECTIONS FOR WHAT

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:53.298
THEY'RE WORTH ALL ARE SUGGESTING

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.801
THAT FERTILIZER PRICES ALL ARE

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.469
LIKELY TO BE STABLE NOT COME

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.404
DOWN BUT BE STABLE IN MY

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:00.772
COLLEAGUE AARON SMITH. HAS

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:03.108
ANALYZED- THOSE FERTILIZER

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.378
PRICES IN SOME DETAIL. THE THIRD

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.413
THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.116
ARM. AS FARMERS BY THE FULL

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.051
RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES FROM

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:15.954
THE ECONOMY EVERYTHING. UP FROM

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.457
FROM FARM LABOR TO SERVICES

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.559
ACCOUNTING SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.061
INFLATION IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:25.731
AFFECTS COSTS ON FARMS I'LL GIVE

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.466
YOU AN EXAMPLE THE PRICE OF

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.334
HOUSING IN L. A. GOES UP AND WE

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.670
JUST HEARD HOUSING IS A BIG PART

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:32.204
OF THE INFLATION RATE FOR

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.039
CONSUMERS. WHAT IS THAT HAVE TO

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:37.442
DO WITH FARMS- WORKERS OF

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.344
COMPETE FOR HIGHER WAGES IF AN

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.280
ACCOUNTING FIRM WANTS TO KEEP

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.148
ITS WORKERS IT PAYS MORE. THE

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.150
COST OF ACCOUNTING SERVICES TO A

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.653
FARM OF THEN GOES UP AND SO

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.054
THESE THINGS ARE VERY CLOSELY

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.790
CONNECTED AND WHAT YOU THINK IS

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.492
TWO OR THREE STEPS AWAY FROM THE

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.361
FARM WILL AFFECT FORM COSTS. AND

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:58.697
THAT'S IMPORTANT. BOB THERE ARE

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:02.200
ALSO FAR- SPECIFIC- OF FORM

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:05.037
FACTORS THAT AFFECT NDIVIDUAL

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.939
MARKETS FOR EXAMPLE I MENTIONED

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:10.576
WALNUT FARMS WILL BE HARD HIT BY

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:11.577
INFLATION BUT THEY'RE ASO

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.512
FACING DROUGHT THEY'RE ALSO

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.581
FACING PORT PROBLEMS FOR THEIR

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.683
EXPORTS BECAUSE THE BACK CALL

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:21.787
ISSUE OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS AND

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:23.889
ALL THEY'VE BEEN FACING MORE

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.023
COMPETITION IN GROUP GROWING

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.292
MARKETS SO THERE'S NO REASON TO

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.727
THINK WALMART PRICES ARE GOING

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.996
TO BE MUCH HIGHER IN TWENTY

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.831
TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S A REALLY

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:33.432
SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEIR

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.801
COSTS ARE GOING UP BECAUSE THE

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:36.501
INFLATION. AND THAT'S A

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.236
CHALLENGE FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIES

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:40.439
LET ME TAKE THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.707
MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT HIRED FARM

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:45.444
WORKERS BECAUSE THERE ARE A

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.479
CRUCIAL AND CENTRAL PART OF

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.348
AGRICULTURE. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.283
FOOD SERVICE WORKERS. THEY ARE

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.385
AMONG THE MOST LOW WAGE AND

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:56.288
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.689
. ALL THEIR WROTE WAGES ARE

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:00.092
RISING BUT IT'S HARD FOR THOSE

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.994
WAGES TO KEEP UP FOR WITH

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.496
INFLATION LET ME JUST GIVE YOU

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:05.864
AN EXAMPLE SO YOU HAVE WORKERS

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.367
ON A FARM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.535
OF CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS- THE

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.504
WAGE RATE GOES FRM TWENTY BUCKS

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:15.607
AN HOUR TO TWENTY ONE FIFTY THIS

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.376
SUMMER. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.378
KEEP UP WITH INFLATION FOR THOSE

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:22.581
WORKERS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:23.682
UP WITH THEIR FOOD PRICE

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.318
INFLATION. FURTHERMORE FOR THOSE

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.453
WORKERS THE DROUGHT IS GOING TO

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.789
MEAN LESS WORK AVAILABLE. STILL

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.758
HIGHER WAGES ARE GONNA LEAVE

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.292
THOSE PEOPLE EVEN MORE

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.328
VULNERABLE THAN THEY STARTED.

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.963
AND THIS IS TYPICAL FOR

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.297
INFLATION THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.433
HURT WORSE THAN OTHERS- SOME

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.569
PEOPLE CAN HAVE PRICED THEIR OWN

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.737
WAGES OF THEIR PRICES THE KEEP

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:50.108
UP. UP THIS UNCERTAINTY THIS

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:52.511
IMBEDDED WITHIN THEM INFLATION

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.346
IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.581
THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:59.918
ASSOCIATED WITH THE- WINDING

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.953
DOWN OF INFLATION AND THAT

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.989
ESPECIALLY HAS TO DO WITH

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.924
INTEREST RATES. AND THEN WE CAN

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.726
TALK LATER IF YOU'D LIKE ABOUT

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:09.961
THE SEVERE PROBLEMS WE HAD IN

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.063
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:12.798
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BUT LET

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:14.766
ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. AS

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:17.502
INTEREST RATES ARE RISING NOW WE

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.237
A RECOGNIZE HOW CAPITAL

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.707
INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IS WHETHER

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:25.944
IT'S ALL. THE STATUTE TREES THAT

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.213
LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS MAJOR

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.816
CAPITAL INVESTMENT LONG TIME PAY

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:34.519
OFF. FARMS BOROUGH MONEY AT. IN

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:37.923
THE OVER THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.791
YEARS VERY LOW INTEREST RATES.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:42.094
EASIER TO PAY THAT BACK OVER THE

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.362
LONG HAUL. NOW WE SEE RISING

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.198
INTEREST RATES MUCH HIGHER

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:49.034
INTEREST COSTS IN THE ONLY MAKES

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:50.702
SENSE IF YOU THINK THE OUTPUT

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.038
PRICES ARE GONNA STAY HIGHER

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:55.240
GOAL HIGHER WITH INFLATION. THAT

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:57.843
IS TO SAY TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.811
THE LOAN WITH INFLATED DOLLARS

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.780
OF FORM AS TO BE COMFORTABLE

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:03.849
AND CONFIDENT THAT THESE PRICES

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:06.184
ARE CONTINUE TO GO UP. THIS

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.320
NAVIGATING THE WINDING DOWN OF

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:11.089
INFLATION. THEN RAISES EVEN MORE

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.425
CONCERNS OR AT LEAST EQUAL

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.227
CONCERNS AND HAS ITS OWN

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:17.596
PROBLEMS AND I THINK AS WE HAVE

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.397
THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHERS.

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:22.267
BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL INFLATION

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.802
AND INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:25.170
WELL THAT'S A WHOLE SET OF

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.873
CHALLENGES WE ALL OUGHT TO KEEP

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:30.108
OUR EYE ON. IT LET ME STOP THERE

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:31.610
. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:33.712
PROFESSOR THAT WAS KIND OF A I

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.647
OPENING JOLT TO SUGGEST THAT.

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.549
OUR ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.385
INFLATION WILL END UP- WILL HAVE

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.020
A SEND UP WITH RISING COSTS FOR

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:45.390
FOOD- LONGER LONGER TERM IN THE

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.526
OUT YEARS BECAUSE OF- THIS

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:50.128
INCREASED RATES. SO THANK YOU

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:53.765
FOR THAT LET'S- LET'S GO BACK TO

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:55.667
BOTH OF YOU TOUCHED ON INFLATION

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.636
OBVIOUSLY- SINCE WE'RE TALKING

00:23:57.702 --> 00:24:00.772
ABOUT THIS BUT- WHAT WE WANT TO.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.407
DEAL WITH IN AND DOCUMENT

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.576
NIKOLSBURG I WANTED TO ASK YOU

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.312
WAS HOW DO WE CONTROL NOT

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:08.680
CONTROL INFLATION BUT ALLEVIATE

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:12.317
INFLATION FOR CALIFORNIANS AND-

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:14.386
THIS- IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.488
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WAYS TO

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:20.392
PUSH MONEY TO CALIFORNIANS AS A

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.828
WAY TO. ASSIST THEM WITH RISING

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:24.596
COSTS A LOT OF THAT FOCUS HAS

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:26.398
BEEN ON THE COST OF GASOLINE

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:30.635
WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY-

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:33.271
IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T. A FACT

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:36.608
EVERY CALIFORNIAN- THE SAME WAY

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:39.044
BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSALS

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.079
TO DO IT THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.548
CARS BUT- I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.550
THAT DOCTOR NIKOLSBURG ON ON HOW

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:47.519
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:48.587
CALIFORNIANS I ALSO WOULD LIKE

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:53.725
TO. ASK YOU TO- TWAY IN ON KIND

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:56.695
OF THE BIGGER PICTURE HOW DOES

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.730
GIVING CASH SUPPORT TO

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:02.367
CONSUMERS- AT THE SAME TIME IT

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:03.468
HELPING THEM PAY FOR INCREASED

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:06.838
COSTS- IMPACT. THAT THE UPWARD

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.841
PRESSURES ON INFLATION AS WELL

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:13.612
THANK YOU DOCTOR NIKOLSBURG. THE

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:16.047
USER THERE TWO QUESTIONS THE

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:18.583
FIRST IS HOW CAN CALIFORNIA

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.986
ALLEVIATE. INFLATION FOR

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:24.623
CALIFORNIANS MOST OF WHAT

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:27.592
HOUSEHOLDS BY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.161
THAT IS OUR OUR OUR PURCHASE IS

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:32.364
PURCHASED IN NATIONAL MARKETS

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.699
AND THEREFORE THERE'S VERY

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.801
LITTLE THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:40.739
ALLEVIATE. INCREASES IN NATIONAL

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.474
PRICES THEY'RE VERY FEW THINGS

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.109
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.577
ARE PURCHASED ONLY IN OUR LOCAL

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:48.647
MARKETS ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:51.349
IS HOUSING. AND WE KNOW THAT-

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.151
HOME PRICES HAVE BEEN GOING UP

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:58.823
AND THEY THEY SHOULD. INDICATE

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.660
THAT IN TERMS OF THE GASOLINE

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:04.095
PRICES WILL PRICES ARE

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:07.399
DETERMINED IN WORLD MARKETS. SO

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.567
CALIFORNIANS COULD BE SUBSIDIZED

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:11.636
IN THEIR PURCHASES OF GASOLINE

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:14.773
IT MEANS THAT. WE CALIFORNIANS

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.775
WILL PURCHASE MORE GASOLINE AND

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:19.744
BECAUSE WE HAVE A SPECIFIC BLEND

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:22.847
OF GASOLINE. THE FORMER AIR

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:26.885
QUALITY REASONS AT THAT MIGHT

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:29.554
HAVE SOME IMPACT BUT MY GUESS IS

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:31.222
THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ONLY

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:33.224
MARGINAL IMPACT AND NOT ONE THAT

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:36.328
IS REALLY GOING TO BE FELT VERY

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:38.430
MUCH BY HOUSEHOLDS. AND I'M

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:39.464
SORRY THERE'S A SECOND PART OF

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.766
THE QUESTION WELL I THINK LASTLY

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:43.335
WHILE WE TRY TO LEVY EIGHT THE

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.669
PRESSURE OF INFLATION ON

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:46.471
CALIFORNIANS DOES PUSHING

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.674
CASTING CALIFORNIANS INCREASE.

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.143
THE ACTUAL UPPER PRESSURE ON ON

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.378
PRICES BECAUSE THERE'S MORE

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:57.349
DEMAND FOR CONSUMPTION. AND

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:57.849
POTENTIALLY EVEN GREATER

00:26:57.916 --> 00:27:02.954
INFLATION. THERE IS INDEED THAT

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:04.956
POSSIBILITY AND IT DEPENDS ON

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:07.959
HOW MUCH. THE INCREASED DEMANDS

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.228
FROM THE TRANSFER OF THE INCOME

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.597
TO CLIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ND IS

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:15.200
FELT IN PARTICULAR MARKETS THAT

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:18.503
IS HOW FAST CAN SUPPLIERS OF

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.537
GOODS RESPOND TO THAT INCREASED

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:21.373
DEMAND. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.675
SEEING BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:26.845
SHORTAGES TODAY IS THE SUPPLIERS

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:29.180
CAN'T RESPOND VERY FAST. AND IN

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:31.549
SAID THAT TRANSFER OF INCOME- IN

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:35.086
TURN RESULTS IN HIGHER PRICES-

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:37.288
BUT NOT MUCH ALLEVIATION OF THE

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.758
IMPACT OF INFLATION ON.

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.993
INDIVIDUALS BUDGETS. HOWEVER

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.928
THERE'S A DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:47.232
AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS AS-

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:48.967
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE LOWER

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.301
INCOME LESS AFFLUENT

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:52.670
CALIFORNIANS SPEND DOUBLE THE

00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:54.939
PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME ON

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.409
FOOD THEN THE OTHER CALIFORNIA

00:27:57.475 --> 00:28:00.178
HOUSEHOLDS. AND IN BECAUSE OF

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.014
THAT. ONE CAN ALLEVIATE THE

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:04.883
IMPACT OF INFLATION ON THESE THE

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.885
MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:09.454
THROUGH INCOME TRANSFERS. THANK

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:10.722
YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT POINT

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:13.458
AND SO MUCH ATTENTION HERE IN

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.794
THE CAPITAL HAS BEEN ON HOW DO

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.230
WE- GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE TO DEAL

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.766
WITH INFLATION AND THE GOVERNOR

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.002
HAS A PROPOSAL OF A PUSHING THAT

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:26.571
OUT TO PEOPLE WHO. OWN A VEHICLE

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.541
SO- I THINK IT'S PROPOSALS FOUR

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.109
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VEHICLE

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:33.878
OWNED BY AN INDIVIDUAL- BUT WHAT

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:36.047
HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS HOW

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:38.049
DO WE BROADEN THE NUMBER OF

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.384
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.618
BE RECEIVING THIS TYPE OF

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:44.456
SUPPORT. AND ONE MENTION OF WHY

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:46.224
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.126
DECIDED TO PUSH THIS THROUGH

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.161
OWNERSHIP OF VEHICLES IS BECAUSE

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.430
THE DMV HAS- A BETTER COMPUTER

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:55.533
SYSTEM TO PUSH THESE CHECKS OUR

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.502
AND IDENTIFY WHO PEOPLE ARE IN

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.170
THE STATE IN OTHER PARTS OF

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:02.507
CALIFORNIA OR OTHER. DEPARTMENTS

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.210
IN CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES-

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.079
WOOD AND I AM THIS IS- I DON'T

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:10.014
MEAN TO GIVE YOU A POP QUIZ ON

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.583
THIS SO I I'VE I APOLOGIZE BUT

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:14.018
WOULD IT BE. MORE EFFECTIVE TO

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.854
REACH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.923
DESCRIBED- LOWER INCOME

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.259
CALIFORNIANS IS IF WE WERE STILL

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:23.428
TO USE THE DMV DISTRIBUTION

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:30.935
pA STATE ID. MEANING I SEPARATING

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:33.104
THIS FROM VEHICLE OWNERSHIP BUT

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:34.772
ANYONE WHO HAS A STATE ID

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.407
MEANING THAT PERHAPS OTHER

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.376
PEOPLE ON PEOPLE WITH FEWER

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.345
RESOURCES I DON'T OWN VEHICLES

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:44.382
WOULD ALSO BE BENEFITING FROM.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:49.521
THIS- CHECK DISPERSAL. SO ABSENT

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:50.722
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:53.858
SYSTEMS THAT THE STATE HAS. TO

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:58.263
IDENTIFY CALIFORNIANS- IT

00:29:58.329 --> 00:30:02.400
ANOTHER SYSTEM WOULD- PERHAPS BE

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.336
MORE EFFICACIOUS BECAUSE YOU

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.472
KNOW LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.641
MIGHT NOT EVEN OWN AN AUTOMOBILE

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:13.411
THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT AS WELL

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:16.247
TRANSFERRING FOUR HUNDRED

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.183
DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.185
EACH CAR OWNED DOESN'T RECOGNIZE

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.487
WHETHER THAT CAR USES

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:25.990
ELECTRICITY OR GASOLINE. AND

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:29.494
SELL IT IT IS A- VERY BROAD

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.496
BRUSH WAITED TO ADDRESS THE

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.465
PROBLEM BUT AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:35.366
LEAKAGES FROM THAT AND IT

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.468
DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.938
THOSE WHO ARE MOST HURT BY

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:42.840
INFLATION PARTICULARLY AS IT.

WEEK TWICE A WEEK TO LET US KNOW

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.203
VARIATION EGG PRICES ARE A

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:27.705
GALLON OF MILK- AND PERHAPS

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:29.073
MAYBE IF THEY DID THAT WE WOULD

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.143
BE MORE SENSITIVE TO IT- BUT MY

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.211
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS

HAVE NOTICED AG PRICES AND WE'VE

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:43.921
TALKED A LOT ABOUT NATIONAL-

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:46.391
PRICE MAKING ON COMMODITY. BUT

00:33:46.457 --> 00:33:48.159
NOT AS MUCH ABOUT REGIONAL

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:50.294
VARIATION SO I LIVE IN THE NORTH

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.196
BAY IN IN MARIN COUNTY VERY

00:33:52.263 --> 00:33:55.299
HEALTHY AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.868
FOR EGGS AS WELL AS MILK AND

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.470
OTHER PRODUCTS AND- AND SO

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.772
THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:03.241
PROVIDERS. IN OUR STORES- FOR

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:05.843
THOSE COMMODITIES DO WE SEE MORE

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.278
LOCAL AT YOU KNOW DOCTOR NICHOLS

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.880
FOR TALK ABOUT HOUSING PRICES

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:11.349
BUT DO WE SEE MORE LOCAL PRICES

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:12.049
FOR SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:16.687
PRODUCTS OR KNOWS THAT ALSO TIED

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:17.221
INTO THESE. THESE NATIONAL

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.557
PRICES. UP IT IS IN THE CASE OF

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:22.160
ACHES ITS THE- INTERESTINGLY YOU

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.561
KNOW ABOVE PROFESSORS LIKE

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.062
COMPLICATED THINGS SO THAT WE

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.031
CAN TRY TO FIGURE HIM OUT SO BUT

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.900
BUT LET ME JUST SAY ABOUT ACHES

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:31.702
A CALIFORNIA IS A BIT OF A

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:32.670
SEPARATE MARKET THE AVIAN

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.772
INFLUENZA NATIONALLY HAS RAISED

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:36.541
THE PRICE OF CALIFORNIA ACHES

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:39.444
GENERALLY BUT IS YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.979
NOW IMPLEMENTED THE IT'LL BE A

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:46.384
PORTIONS OF A PROP TWELVE WHICH

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.719
SAID THE EGGS IN CALIFORNIA MUST

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:52.190
BE CAGE AT LEAST CAGE FREE. ALL

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:55.860
CAGE FREE EGGS COST 50% OR SO.

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.295
SOMETIMES DOUBLE WHAT

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:00.097
CONVENTIONAL EGGS DO. SO IF YOU

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.033
WERE TO TAKE A QUICK TRIP TO

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:03.367
CHICAGO OR OR OR SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.269
YOU'D FIND EGGS A LOT CHEAPER

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.104
THAN THEY ARE IN MARIN COUNTY.

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:09.674
BUT ALL IT TAKES NATIONALLY

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.076
ALMOST ALL ACHES NATIONALLY OF

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.312
SPIKED. WELL BECAUSE OF THIS

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:16.914
AVIAN INFLUENZA IT ALSO HAPPENED

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:19.417
TO HEAR THE THESE THESE DISEASE

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.587
ISSUES. WHITE FOR HUMANS THEY

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:25.590
COMING GOAL AND INFLUENZA IS A

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.125
IS A CHICKEN DISEASE IT'S QUITE

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:29.293
COMMON AND WHEN IT'S BAD EIGHT

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.596
PRICES GO UP NATIONALLY. BUT THE

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:33.397
OTHER THING ABOUT A CRISIS I- I

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:35.766
SHOULD SAY IS LOCALLY PRODUCED

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.768
EGGS JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:40.505
COUNTRY ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.740
THAN THE NATIONAL LAKE PRICE. IN

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.108
THE REASON IS PEOPLE TEND TO

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:46.177
PRODUCE SPECIALLY ACHES SO IN

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.579
MARIN COUNTY YOU WILL HAVE. A

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.115
NOT JUST CAGE FREE BUT FREE

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.718
RANGE OR WHAT SOMETIMES WHAT'S

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.987
CALLED PASTURE RAISED EGGS. OF

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:59.457
THEIR- LOTS CONSUMERS LIKE COME.

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:02.226
UP BUT BUT THEY'RE STILL ONE OR

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.395
2% OF ALL THE EGGS CONSUMED IN

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.397
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY ARE A

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:08.799
LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT THEY

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:10.868
HAVE UNLIKE SOME LOCAL PRODUCTS

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.970
THAT CAN BE CHEAPER IN AEGS THEY

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.472
TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.275
BECAUSE THERE. ARE VERY MUCH A

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:20.578
SPECIALTY PRODUCT. YEAH THAT IS

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.446
A LOT BETTER TO- AND IF AND IF

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:23.848
YOU CAN AFFORD IT THAT'S GREAT

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.250
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO WE-

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.818
WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:30.288
ENTIRE PANDEMIC- THE CRIPPLING

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:33.157
OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND I'D SAY

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.993
LIKE THE MOST FAMOUS ONE OF THIS

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.994
MOMENT WHICH WHICH PROBABLY

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:39.430
ISN'T. FACTOR THE INFLATION

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.198
STORY DOESN'T FACTOR INTO WHAT

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:42.733
HAPPENED A BABY FORMULA- I THINK

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.068
THAT'S A SERIES OF LOTS OF

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.003
UNFORTUNATE POLICIES AND EVENTS

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.506
THAT THAT IMPACTED THAT- BUT DO

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.641
WE DO WE SEE THE IMPACTS OF THE

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.511
SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. ALSO

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.614
DRIVING UP COSTS BECAUSE OF THE

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.416
FOURTEENTH THEN THE LACK OF

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.418
PRODUCTION BECAUSE THE HOARDINGS

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.486
SUPPRESSED PURCHASE SCENE AND

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.055
THEN NOW THE DEMAND IS RISING

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.891
THAT THAT SUPPLY DOESN'T EXIST

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:09.393
AND SO THERE IS INCREASED COST.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.295
UP THERE THAT'S NOT THAT'S

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:13.064
THAT'S NOT A BIG FACTOR I'M SURE

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.199
THEIR CASES WERE WERE SOMETHING

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:18.169
LIKE THAT HAPPENED. UP THE

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:21.405
BIGGEST ISSUE FOR US SUPPLY

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:23.708
CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AFFECTING

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:26.043
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FARMS AND

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.914
RANCHES HERE HAS BEEN THE PORT

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:33.384
DISRUPTIONS IN UP THAT ACTUALLY

00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:35.686
MAKE FOOD PRICES SLIGHTLY LOWER

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.888
HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN IN THE U.

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:40.625
S. SO OFTEN PRICES I MENTIONED

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.460
WALNUT PRICES BUT ALMOND PRICES

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:45.229
ARE ALSO GOING TO BE A BIT LOWER

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:46.097
THAN THEY'D OTHERWISE BE.

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:47.765
BECAUSE SHE SHIPPING CONTAINERS

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:49.667
HAVE BEEN HARD TO FIND WHICH

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.969
MEANS EXPORTS ARE DOWN WHICH

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:53.537
MEANS THE A BIT MORE OF THOSE

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.239
ALMONDS OR INTO THE IN THE U. S.

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:58.075
MARKET. AND THAT HAS A- AFFECT

00:37:58.142 --> 00:38:00.711
LOWERING PRICES AND THAT'S TRUE

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:01.946
FOR SEVERAL. A PROCESSING

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.749
TOMATOES AND A FEW OTHER- OF

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:06.784
AGRICULTURAL OUTPUTS THAT ARE

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:11.322
BETTER OFF. IT HEAVILY EXPORTED.

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.723
THEY WOULD BE EVEN MORE

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.159
EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAN THE

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:17.728
REST OF THE UNITED STATES IF

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.730
THEY DIDN'T FACE THE PORT

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.832
DISRUPTIONS. ME IS ALSO FACE

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.234
SOME OF THOSE SAME PORT

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.835
DISRUPTIONS AND MEAT PRICES HAVE

00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:26.704
BEEN ONE OF THE HEADLINES FOR

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.939
HIGH PRICES FOR A NUMBER OF

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:31.308
SUPPLY DISRUPTION REASONS. BUT

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:33.878
OF THE PORT ISSUE PROBABLY KEEPS

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.680
BECAUSE WE EXPORT MEAT FROM THE

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:38.649
UNITED STATES PROBABLY KEEPS A

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:41.719
MEAT PRICES SOMEWHAT. LOWER THAN

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.921
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE SO THE

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.457
SUPPLY CHAIN CAN CUT BOTH WAYS

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:49.326
FOR CONSUMERS. YOU MENTIONED UP

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.162
OF BABY FOOD IN IT AND IT'S A

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:54.799
CORD OR BETA A MILK UP OF.

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:57.101
FORMULA FOR BABIES AND THAT'S A

00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.638
VERY SPECIAL ITEM IS YOU KNOW A

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.773
SIX YEAR 70% OF THE BABY FORMULA

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.008
IS PURCHASED THROUGH A

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.343
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. OF THE WICK

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.481
PROGRAM AND IN VERY. IN IN

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:13.417
THERE'S A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:15.619
WHO IS ALLOWED TO PRODUCE MILK

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.455
FOR EACH STATE AND THINGS LIKE

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:22.259
THAT AND IT'S- BASICALLY A-

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:24.595
SYSTEM THAT SORT OF SEEM PRIMED

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.130
FOR DISRUPTION IT ANYTIME THERE

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.932
WAS A SHOCK AND OF COURSE WE HAD

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:30.601
A FEW OF THOSE. SO IT'S A PRETTY

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:33.604
SPECIALIZED SYSTEM. I WOULD SAY

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.340
IN IN OTHER AREAS THE SUPPLY

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:40.244
CHAIN ARM. HAS BEEN IN- WHAT I

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:42.346
LIKE TO SAY IS IF YOU HAVE YOUR

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.148
SPECIALIZED BRAND OF SOMETHING

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:45.216
OF THERE'S A REASONABLE CHANCE

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:47.184
IT'S GOING TO BE DELAYED AND YOU

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:49.220
MAY YOU MAY MISS OUT. IN THE

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.688
SAME WITH MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.223
IF YOU WERE WILLING TO TAKE

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:54.592
WHATEVER WAS THERE. YOU'RE

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.693
PROBABLY ALRIGHT BUT MOST OF US

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.195
HAVE. SLOUGHED TASTES AND

00:39:58.262 --> 00:40:00.331
PREFERENCES THAT LIMIT WHAT WE

00:40:00.397 --> 00:40:02.933
WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO BUY. INTO

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.935
THE SUPPLY CHAIN GETS INTO THAT.

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.304
I DON'T SEE THAT IS A MAJOR

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.974
INFLATION CONTRIBUTOR WHAT IS A

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.076
MAJOR CONTRACT. INFLATION

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.111
CONTRIBUTOR AS WE HEARD A FEW

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.247
MINUTES AGO IS THE PRICE OF FUEL

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:18.149
SO FOOD HAS TO BE MOVED AROUND

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.851
WHETHER IT'S- IN A PICKUP TRUCK

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.987

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.822
TRAIN OUT. YOU KNOW BRINGING

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:27.258
MEAT FROM THE MIDWEST IN BOTH OF

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.360
THOSE USE UEL AND THEY BOTH

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.829
RAISE THE COST OF FEED OF FOOD

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.398
AT RETAIL. RELATIVE TO THE PRICE

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:38.502

CALIFORNIA'S. SINCE THE

BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:40.724
SINCE JANUARY FOOD INSECURITY IN

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.326
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN RISING

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.728
STEADILY. THE LATEST DATA SHOWS

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.764
THAT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.066

DISPARITIES FOR BLACK AND LATIN

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.544
DOUBLE THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:05.015
MORE THAN. TWO YEARS INTO THE

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.951
PROCESS. SO IT'S NO. THAT A

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:08.619
RECENT SURVEY OF WORK MEETINGS

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:11.088
FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OFF.

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.122
ORDER THAT THEY'RE SERVING

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.358

AFRICAN POP. I'M AND AS YOU KNOW

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.514
THE COVERED PANDEMIC IS

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.882
COMPOUNDED WITH INFLATION TO

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:53.784
DRIVE INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.019
IMMIGRANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA- SO

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.320
I'LL START WITH AN ANALYSIS DONE

IN THE PACIFIC ARE UP EIGHT

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.930
POINT TWO PERCENT. A RATE

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:08.498
SIMILAR TO THE US OVERALL RATE

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:11.735
OF EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT- AND

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.171
THESE INCREASES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.372
AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE ENERGY AND

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:17.374
GASOLINE- THE P. P. I SEE ALSO

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.708
ESTIMATES THAT THE LOWEST INCOME

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:19.810
FAMILIES HAVE EXPERIENCED AN

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:21.178
OVERALL PRICE INCREASE OF NINE

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.480
POINT SIX PERCENT. OVER THE PAST

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.382
TWO YEARS WHILE HIGHER INCOME

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.716
FAMILIES HAVE SEEN SOMETHING

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:27.517
MORE LIKE EIGHT POINT TWO

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:30.187
PERCENT. I AND DOLLAR TERMS. TO

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.488
PURCHASE THE SAME THINGS THAT

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:33.256
THEY BOUGHT IN TWENTY NINETEEN.

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.625
THE LOWEST FIFTH OF IT IN INCOME

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.494
BRACKET FAMILIES. WE NEED TO

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.895
SPEND AN ADDITIONAL THREE

00:51:38.962 --> 00:51:40.030
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR SO

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.698
WE'RE SEEING AN EX AN EXTREME

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.799
BURDEN ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.868
AND SO. I'LL BE FOCUSING ON LOW.

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:50.307
INCOME IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES- SO

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.942
CAP C. ALONG OUR FRIENDS NURSE

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.910
CAL. REESE PARTNERED WITH THE

00:51:53.977 --> 00:51:55.612
UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH AND

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:59.216
POLICY RESEARCH- TO LOOK AT A

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.884
STATE SURVEY DATA AND EXAMINE

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.118
OUR FOOD SECURITY AMONG

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:04.488
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.656
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT MORE THAN

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:07.491
TWO IN FIVE OR FORTY FIVE

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:09.326
PERCENT. I HAVE REPORTED

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:11.394
EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY- IN

THE PAST AND IN TWENTY TWENTY.

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:15.131
SO FOR REFERENCE THE AVERAGE

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.166
RATE OF FOOD SECURITY IN

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:19.302
CALIFORNIA- USING- USDA DATA

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.338
FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.073
TWENTY. IS NINE POINT 8% SO THIS

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:25.275
RATE IS SEVERELY HIGHER THAN

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.244
THAN THE NATIONAL DATA THAT WE

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.346
HAVE AVAILABLE- WE ALSO FOUND

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:30.981
THAT RATES OF FOOD INSECURITY

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:31.982
ARE ESPECIALLY ACUTE FOR

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:34.818
CHILDREN. A 64% OF UNDOCUMENTED

AND SO TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS.

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.629
SHOWS UP IN SOMEONE'S LIFE- I

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:47.497

COMMUNITY. HAVE RISEN IN PRICE-

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:43.687
AND IT'S ADDING ADDITIONAL

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:45.021
STRESS AND CONSTRAINTS ON HER

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:47.591
FAMILY'S BUDGET- SO- YOU KNOW

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.192
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO GET ACROSS

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.527
TODAY'S THAT THIS HARDSHIP AS

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.129
YOU NO. INFLATION IS GONE IT FOR

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:54.731
LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS.

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.066
EXACERBATING FOOD AND SECURITY

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:58.268
BUT IT'S- IT'S A CYCLE OF FOOD

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.603
INSECURITY AND POVERTY THAT HAS

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:02.105
PERSISTED FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:05.442
ESPECIALLY IN WORKING FAMILIES-

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:07.877
OF. FOR THE UCLA THE UCLA DATA

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.547
WE FOUND THAT FROM THE YEARS

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:11.514
TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.549
FOOD INSECURITY RATES AMONG US

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:14.684
NONCITIZEN ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:17.520
HAVE BEEN RANGING FROM 37% TO

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:19.656
FIFTY FOUR PERCENT- AND FOR THE

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:20.890
SAME YEARS THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:22.292
NONCITIZENS AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.194
INCOME BELOW THE- FEDERAL

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.830
POVERTY THRESHOLD. RANGE FROM

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.932
24% TO TWENTY TO FORTY PERCENT.

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:30.934
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:32.736
OF SUSTAIN HARDSHIP DEMONSTRATES

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:35.071
THE NEED FOR SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS-

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.573
THAT'S THAT DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.209
POVERTY AND MITIGATE FOOD

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.478
INSECURITY AND THE LONG TERM- SO

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.480
I'LL JUST MOVE ON TO WHAT- SOME

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.782
PROPOSALS THAT WE'D WE'D LIKE TO

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:48.618
HIGHLIGHT- FOR THE STATE- TO

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:50.220
CONSIDER TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.122
CALIFORNIANS FACING HARDSHIP.

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:53.356
I'M PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:55.825
IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS. OF THE

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:58.028
FIRST PROPOSAL- BECAUSE DUBBED

00:54:58.094 --> 00:54:59.963
FOOD FOR ALL IT'S BEING ADVANCED

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.931
AS SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY FOUR.

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.900
AUTHORED BY SENATOR MELISSA HER

THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO-

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.510
THE GOAL FOOD FALLS TO AND THE

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.045
EXCLUSION OF CALIFORNIANS FROM

SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:23.853

THEM THAT THEY THINK OF ANOTHER

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:04.793
WAY TO TRY AND ADOPT AND CHANGE

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.261

MAKING SPEECH ABOUT FROM THE

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.265
BEGINNING RESPECTIVOS WELL

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:14.536
THAT'S KIND OF AN OVERVIEW. BUT

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:19.207
I WOULD GIVE STATEWIDE. I'M IF

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.110
YOUR HONOR IF I MAY I THINK ONE

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.146
THING THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT-

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.714
WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.316
AND DELIVERING OF BENEFITS-

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:28.884
CALIFORNIA DOES NEED TO IMPROVE

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:31.153
OUR- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.055
SEE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.423
RESPOND DURING THE PAST. HOW DO

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:37.526
WE GET MONEY AND HANDS OUTING A

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:38.160
MILLION HANDS RIGHT AWAY WERE

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.361
FORTUNATE WHEN IT CAME TO. TWO

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.096
CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS WERE ABLE

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.664
TO MOVE VERY SWIFTLY. BUT I

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.265
THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.033
COMMUNITIES THAT THE STATE.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.435
NEEDS TO REALLY THINK LONG TERM

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:48.236
AS- STE MORE SPECIFIC TO THE

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.472
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY- WHO THE

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:51.473
INFRASTRUCTURE WASN'T

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.209
NECESSARILY THERE- AND THEN AS

THAT'S WERE HERE- IN MARCH

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:49.284
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. INFLATION

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:52.921
REACH LEVELS SEEN IN FOUR YEARS

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.823
- ACROSS ALL CONSUMER CATEGORIES

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.892
NOT JUST. THE FOOD SYSTEMS THAT

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.761
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY-

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:00.695
BUT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.732
INFLATION- YOU KNOW US AT C. G.

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.667
A. N. AS GROCERS IN THE GROCERY

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.536
INDUSTRY. WE REFERENCE THE

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:09.471
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.606
PRODUCER PRICE INDEX NOT JUST

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.608
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX BECAUSE

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:15.310
THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX REALLY

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:19.214
TALKS ABOUT. WHAT IT COSTS TO

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:22.584
MAKE AND MOVE GOODS- AND SO AS

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.553
YOU KNOW AS A RETAILER THAT'S

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:27.923
WHAT WE LOOK AT- WE REVIEWED THE

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:30.659
MOST RECENT P. P. I. NUMBERS- IN

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.260
PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL POLY SAN

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.895

THAT PP I INFLATION NUMBER IS

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:44.206
ELEVEN POINT 2% TO GIVE YOU

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:46.341
CONTEXT AROUND THAT- I'M SURE

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:47.709
YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT- THE

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:50.478
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IS AT EIGHT

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.347
POINT FIVE PERCENT. AS OF MARCH

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:53.381
AND THAT'S THE LATEST NUMBER WE

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.183
HAVE ON THAT SO THERE IS A BIG

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.551
DISPARITY THERE IN WHAT IT'S

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:59.988
COSTING TO MAKE GOODS AND TO

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:03.325

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.628
OF STE TOUCHED ON EARLIER

ANOTHER PANELS BUT- GAS GAS

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.666
PRICES ARE UP WATERS UP ENERGY

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.468
INGREDIENTS PACKAGING AND

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.637
TRANSPORTATION EVERYTHING. EVERY

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.305
STOP ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.940
ORDER TO GET FOOD TO- A

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:22.344
CALIFORNIA. IS UP. AND SO WHEN

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.679
WE'RE OPERATING AS RETAILERS ON

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.648
RAZOR THIN MARGINS. YOU KNOW

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.149
THOSE COSTS ARE NATURALLY GOING

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.018
TO GO UP AND IN FACT SOME OF OUR

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.119
MEMBERS HAVE EVEN GONE OUT SO

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:33.488
FAR IS TO EAT. SOME OF THESE

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.024
INCREASES ON STAPLE ITEMS LIKE

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:38.126
BREAD- MILK AND EGGS. WHICH I

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.161
KNOW IT HAS BEEN A BIG

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:40.996
CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AND YEAH

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.732
THERE ARE A LOT OF PARTS OF THAT

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:44.899
THAT ARE IN- SIGNIFICANTLY

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.234
HIGHER- BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE.

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:47.302
EATING FRANKLY THOSE THOSE

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:50.672
INCREASES IN COSTS- AND- AND

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.407
DOING WHAT THEY CAN FOR

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:56.611
CALIFORNIANS- ACCORDING. TO THE

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:59.848
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS P. PI

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:02.450
- PRODUCTION INFLATION IS UP

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:07.122
THIRTY ONE POINT 9% ENERGY IS UP

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:10.125
THIRTY FIVE POINT 7% PACKAGING

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:14.829

AND TRANSPORTATION IS UP TWENTY

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.900
POINT 2% SO THESE ARE REALLY

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.802
REALLY LARGE NUMBERS IN THE

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.004
SPECIFIC SECTORS ANY STOPS ALONG

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.907
THE SUPPLY CHAIN- WE HAPPEN TO

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:27.876
BE THE CULMINATION OF WHERE ALL

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:31.980
OF THAT STUFF MEETS. ANDWHERE

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.982
THE CONSUMER SEES THE PRICE TAG

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:35.483
. SO WE DO WHAT WE CAN WE

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.519
DEFINITELY ARE- INTERVAL PARTS

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:38.953
OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WANT TO

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.990
SERVE THEM- WE'VE BEEN FEELING

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:42.991
IT RIGHT ALONG WITH OUR

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:46.161

INFLATION THAT WERE SEEN THOUGH

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:50.932
IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.334
IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO THE FOOD

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.370
SYSTEM INDUSTRY- SO AS WERE AS

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.272
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. YOU KNOW

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:59.974
THERE'S NOT REALLY ONE SPECIFIC

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.043
THING WE CAN POINT TO AS TO WHY.

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.446
SOMETHING MAY BE HIGHER PRICED

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.214
OR WHY INFLATION IS UP IN ONE

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:08.316
SPECIFIC SPOT LIKE THE YOU KNOW

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:10.952

THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.089
REASONS- CULMINATING ALTOGETHER

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.924
FOR INSTANCE EGGS AVIAN FLU

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.592
HAPPENS TO BE A PIECE OF THAT

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.961

THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR ON

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:25.533
THE A PORTION OF IT AT LEAST.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.068
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THOSE ARE-

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:29.204
ALL LITTLE PIECES THAT PLAY INTO

WORLDWIDE AND MULTI INDUSTRY

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.010
INFLATION RIGHT ALONG WITH

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:38.613
EVERYONE ELSE- AND WE'VE BEEN

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.248
DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MITIGATE

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:42.117
THAT ERE POSSIBLE- WE ARE VERY

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.985
SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF THE

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.353
EFFORTS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.555
THE LAST PANEL- IN FACT WE- ARE.

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.724
PARTNERING WITH. A COUPLE OF

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.394

THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:58.400
ARAMBULA. IT LOOKS TO EXPAND

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.634
WHAT WAS A PILOT PROGRAM ON

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.804
INCREASING- DOLLARS TO. SNAP

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.373

TO GET MORE FRESH FRUITS AND

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.410
VEGETABLES- AND THAT COULD LOOK

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.612
LIKE AS MUCH AS SIXTY DOLLARS-

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:13.281
SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH. AND

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.849
THERE'S ALSO APPEARED BUDGET ASK

HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:24.359
DOLLARS- THAT WE THINK COULD GO

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.493
REALLY LONG WAY TO HELPING

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.062
SUPPORT. BOWL IN GETTING- BETTER

TRYING TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:19.447

YARDS IN HOUSTON WITH CALIFORNIA

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.586
FARM BUREAU I AM THE

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.489
FARM BUREAU. AND I HAVE I SPENT

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:29.324
TWENTY TWO YEARS- IN THIS TOWN-

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.326
WORKING- IN AG POLICY ABOUT MY

AS YOU MAY KNOW I'M SURE YOU

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.972
KNOW MR LEVINE- BUT BUT OTHERS

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:45.373
WATCHING MAY NOT CALIFORNIA FARM

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.775
BUREAU. IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:48.376
TWO THOUSAND FARMS AND RANCHES

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:50.311
ACROSS THE STATE. AND 80% OF

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:52.213
THOSE FARMS BY THE WAY OUR SMALL

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.415
FARMS. THE BIG EYED AT GFI I'M

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.851
IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER SEVEN

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:58.586
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. PLUS

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.621
ANOTHER EIGHT THOUSAND

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:00.955
SUPPORTING BUSINESSES MANY OF

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:03.057
WHOM YOU HAVE HEARD. ABOUT IT

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:04.959
FROM HERE- ARE THESE BUSINESSES

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.028
SPAN FIFTY SIX OF THE FIFTY

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.830
EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.999
DO NOT HAVE A FARM BUREAU IN SAN

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:12.066
FRANCISCO WHICH PROBABLY MAKES

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.401
SENSE A LOT OF FARM GROUND

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.402
THERE- THAT ALPINE IS BASICALLY-

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:16.504
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.906
DON'T HAVE A FARM BUREAU THERE

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:20.208
BUT WE DO WE SPAN BASICALLY THE

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:21.776
ENTIRE STATE AND WE EXPAND EVERY

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.111
COMMODITY THAT IS GROUND- AND

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:24.846
WE'RE THE ONLY. GROUP THAT THAT

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.881
DOES THAT THAT THAT IS THAT BIG.

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:27.882
WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR OVER A

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:30.685
HUNDRED YEARS- SO WE STARTED IN

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:31.753
NINETEEN NINETY. AND FOR EACH

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.154
AND ONE OF THE EACH AND EVERY

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:35.156
ONE OF THOSE YEARS. FARMERS HAVE

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.090
GATHERED FROM AROUND THE STATE

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.693
TO DISCUSS THE STATE FARM. AND

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.395
TO TALK ABOUT POLICIES THAT

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.530
COULD THAT SHOULD GUIDE US- AS

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.731
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PAST SEVERAL

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.667
YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:46.968
DIFFICULT- BUT THIS PAST ONE

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.671
WAS. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST. AND

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.506
INFLATION IS JUST THE LAST AND

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:52.907
MOST PREDICTABLE RESULT OF THE

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:54.876
POLICY CHOICES THAT HAVE PUT US

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.578
IN THE PLACE THAT WE ARE TODAY.

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.079
I DO NOT GET ME WRONG. I

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.181
UNDERSTAND EVERY YEAR WE FACE

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:01.783
ANOTHER CHALLENGES. WHETHER

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:06.487
CLIMATE CHANGE FOUGHT. THIS

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.488
DISEASE PANDEMIC. ALMOST

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.256
ETCETERA ARE ALL THINGS WE READ

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:10.358
. HALF TO ADAPT. AND I ALSO

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:11.726
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE FACING

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:12.594
SEEMINGLY UNPRECEDENTED

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.462
CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW. IN THE

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.364
MIDST OF AN EPIC DROUGHT. THE

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:18.533
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEN. AND NOW

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.602
ON THE POLICY CHOICES WE MAKE.

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.837
AND WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO LEARN

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.639
FROM THE PAST OR REPEAT. WHILE

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.040
THIS MAY BE THE WORST DROUGHT

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.742
THE FARM BUREAU HAS EVER

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.844
EXPERIENCED IT IS NOT THE FIRST.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.746
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH MULTIPLE

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:33.748
PANDEMICS MULTIPLE WORLD WARS WE

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.350
WERE HERE BEFORE THE FREEWAYS

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.185
BEFORE THE DANCE BEFORE THE

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.420
CANALS BEFORE THE PORTS. WE HAVE

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.422
LIVED THROUGH THE FARM CRISIS OF

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:42.290
THE TWENTIES AND THE THIRTIES

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.591
THE NINETEEN TWENTIES IN THE

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:44.759
NINETEEN THIRTIES WE HAVE LIVED

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:45.960
THROUGH THE FARM CRISIS OF THE

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.329
NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND EACH ONE

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.897
OF THOSE WAS LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:52.734
. THE GROUND SHIFTED. NEVER TO

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.869
RETURN AGAIN TO THE WAY IT WAS.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.437
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MOST PEOPLE

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.673
I'M FORTY FIVE MOST PEOPLE OF MY

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.208
AGE. WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:02.577
NO IDEA. THE FARM CRISIS OF THE

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.812
EIGHTIES EVEN EXISTED. I ONE OF

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.114
THE SPEAKERS MADE REFERENCE TO

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.049
THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.183
HIGHEST INFLATION THAT WE HAVE

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.152
SEEN IN FORTY TWO YEARS I DID A

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.854
QUICK MATH. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.722
TWENTY TWO GO BACK FORTY TWO

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.290
YEARS NINETEEN EIGHTY. SO WE SEE

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:18.793
THE CORRELATION WE SEE THE PETE

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.161
THE PATTERN REPEATING. SO I

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:21.896
WOULD POSTULATE THAT WE ARE IN

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.665
THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER LIKE

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:26.200
CRISIS IN FARMING. BUT WHETHER

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:28.703
IT RESULTS IN A SEISMIC SHIFT OR

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:30.772
NOT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED. WE

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.840
HAVE NOT HAD ANY SERIOUS WATER

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.642
INVESTMENTS IN THIS STATE FOR

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:37.712
OVER THIRTY YEARS. DESPITE FUNDS

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.480
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND VOTER

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.649
WILLINGNESS. NOW ALL THE CUTS

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:43.484
THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN URBAN

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:45.286
AND RURAL AREAS ARE DEEPER THAN

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:48.589
THEY NEEDED TO BE. WE CAN'T EVEN

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:49.557
REPAIR THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.959
HAVE NOW. CENTRE HER TADO HAS

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.461
BEEN ON A CRUSADE TO REPAIR

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.496
CANAL A CANAL THAT IS ESSENTIAL

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:57.131
TO HER DISTRICTS LIVELIHOOD AND

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.067
SHE STILL CAN'T GET THE DESIRED

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:01.936
FUNDS WHICH IS A MERE 1% OF THE

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.005
DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS THAT THE

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:06.808
STATE HAS AVAILABLE TO IT. BUT

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:09.177
IT WAS NOT IN THE MAY REVISE.

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:10.478
THERE ARE STILL COMMUNITIES THAT

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.447
ARE LEFT WANTING. NOW KEEP IN

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:13.815
MIND THAT FARMERS AND

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.550
COMMUNITIES STILL PAY FULL

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:17.618
FREIGHT FOR THEIR WATER WHETHER

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:20.621
THEY GET IT OR NOT. IN ADDITION

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:21.823
TO THE WATER SCARCITY AND PRICE

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:24.025
HIKES WE ARE ALSO FACING WHAT

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:25.460
YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY INPUT

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:30.665
PRICES OF 223100% FORTY TWO

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:31.666
RECENT UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:34.235
STUDY AMMONIA AND POTASSIUM

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.136
ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS FOR

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.338
FERTILIZER HAVE GONE UP A

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.906
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE AND A

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:41.075
HUNDRED AND 8% RESPECTIVELY YEAR

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:43.411
OVER YEAR ACROSS THE NATION. BUT

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.378
THE NUMBERS THAT I HEAR

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.646
CALIFORNIANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:48.850
HIGHER. FRANCE'S ARE ORGANIC

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.284
GROWERS STRUGGLE TO FARID

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.286
NITROGEN OF PLACES AND THEY HAVE

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.288
TO GET CREATIVE AND THOSE THOSE

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.190
OFTEN REPLYING GLOBAL SUPPLY

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.859
CHAINS AND THOSE ARE GETTING

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.827
SQUEEZED. AND THOSE ARE NICHE

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.995
PRODUCTS TO THAT AREN'T

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.396
NECESSARILY SOLD IN THE MIDWEST

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:05.166
. THE SIDES ARE 3100% ABOVE LAST

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.468
YEAR IF YOU CAN GET. NOW THE

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:11.005
USDA ESTIMATES THAT 40% OF CROPS

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.908
NATIONWIDE ARE LOST DUE TO PESTS

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:15.576
AND DISEASE EVERY YEAR. SO

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:17.178
DEARTH OF THESE TOOLS ONLY

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.913
EXACERBATES THE FOOD SUPPLY

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.182
ISSUE AND UNDERMINES OUR CARBON

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:24.919
SEQUESTRATION EFFORTS. SO FOR MY

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.354
FOR THE TOP FUNGICIDE USED IN

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.289
CALIFORNIA I MEAN IT THE OTHERS

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:30.258
MIGHT NOT IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.827
EVEN BE CONSIDERED WILL BE 4100%

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.662
THAT'S FOUR TIMES WHAT IT WAS

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.464
LAST YEAR. FOR ORGANIC GROWERS

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:37.665
HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.233
BASICALLY THE ONLY FUNGICIDE

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.568
THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AND IT'S

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:43.404
GOING TO BE FOUR TIMES WHAT IT

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:45.973
WAS LAST YEAR. DIESEL FUEL IS UP

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.176
5275% EMPLOYEE COSTS ARE UP

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:50.478
10215% AND GOING HIGHER. AND TO

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.480
MAKE IT ALL WORSE MARKETS ARE

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.282
EVAPORATING AS THE GLOBAL SUPPLY

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:55.683
CHAINS BECOME INCREASINGLY

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:59.120
UNAVAILABLE. COME SEPTEMBER WE

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:01.389
WILL BE SHAKING ALMOND TREES BUT

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.957
WE STILL HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:05.092
POUNDS SITTING IN WAREHOUSES

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:06.627
WAITING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.996
OVERSEAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.097
THEY JUST NEED TO GET A

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:36.077
OF US IN DC. AND THAT WAS WHAT

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.211
THE DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT. OUR

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.794
COMMUNITIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.062
BECAUSE THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:58.532

AS WE'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. SO

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:13.581
THE CHOICE IS. THAT WE FACE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:16.717
TODAY. OR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:19.286
DO. NOW IMAGINE IF WE MADE

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:22.723
DIFFERENT CHOICES. IMAGINE IF WE

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.325

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:26.327

THIS IMPRACTICALITY ARE AT HAND

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.634

COMMUNITIES TO INVEST IN WATER

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:36.570

INTERMEDIARIES. WE RECOGNIZE

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:47.948
THAT WHAT MOST ECONOMISTS

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.383
ALREADY AGREE ON. THAT THE MOON

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.752
ROOF BECAUSE OF INFLATION IS AN

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.821
INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF MONEY.

WHAT WE CAN DO TO CONTROL THE

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.766
SUPPLY OF MONEY. BUT THAT DOES

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:06.834
NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE LIMITED IN

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.102

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:24.865
WORKERS. IN ORGANIZED LABOR. THE

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:27.434
FIRST QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:29.136
ASKING OURSELVES AND OTHERS

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.438
POLICYMAKERS THAT ARE THE

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:34.108
SKYROCKETING PRICES THE RESULT

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:36.377
OF INFLATION OR PRICE GOUGING. I

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:37.378
HAVE TO SERIOUSLY QUESTION

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:39.713
THAT'S WHEN I SEE RETAIL STORES

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.849
REPORTING ROCK RECORD PROFITS

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.083
WHILE THE PEOPLE THAT SHOP AND

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:45.519
WORK IN THEIR STORES ARE BARELY

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.887
MAKING ENDS MEET. A RECENT

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:49.056
ANALYSIS DONE BY THE ECONOMIC

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.891
POLICY INSTITUTE FROM DATA

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.660
COLLECTED BY THE NATIONAL INCOME

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.461
AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS SHOW THAT

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:57.431
OVER HALF. OF PRICE INFLATION

01:38:57.498 --> 01:39:00.634
SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY AS

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:02.303
COME FROM FATTER PROFIT MARGINS

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:04.004
. LABOR COSTS MEANWHILE

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:07.508
ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 8% THIS

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.076
IS FAR BIGGER THAN ANY

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:12.413
CONTRIBUTION OF FAST WAGE GROWTH

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.748
. THIS RISE IN PROFITS AS A LOT

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:15.916
ABOUT THE INFLATION OF THE PAST

01:39:15.983 --> 01:39:19.486
YEAR FOR ONE IT REMINDS US THAT

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.654
ONE PERSON'S COST IS ANOTHER'S

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:23.824
INCOME. AND AS A STATE AND AS A

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:24.858
NATION THE MECHANICAL EFFECTS OF

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.827
INFLATION JUST DON'T MAKE US

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:29.096
POOR. HIGHER PRICES IN A GIVEN

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.898
SECTOR MEAN HIGHER POTENTIAL

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:33.567
INCOMES FOR CAPITAL OWNERS AND

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.669
WORKERS IN THAT SECTOR. HOWEVER

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.171
WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:39.073
CURRENT RECOVERY IS THAT THE

01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:40.474
HIGHER REVENUE GENERATED BY

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:43.610
HIGHER PRICES. AS OVERWHELMINGLY

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.346
GUNS TO THE CAPITAL OWNERS AND

01:39:45.412 --> 01:39:47.581
NOT THE WORKERS. THE MOST

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.383
IMPORTANT ANGLES OF INFLATION

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.052
ARE DISTRIBUTIONAL SELL ASKING

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.153
WHY CORPORATE PROFITS ARE

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.390
SPIKING WHILE INFLATION ADJUSTED

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:59.293
WAGES ARE FALLING. IS AMONG THE

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.462
BIGGEST QUESTION WE NEED TO BE

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:03.263
ASKING RIGHT NOW. AND THE

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.798
NARRATIVE THAT CORPORATIONS ARE

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:06.233
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR PROFITS AND

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.435
ANY ATTEMPT TO NORMALIZE THIS IN

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:10.471
SUCH A WAY THAT THE NOTION OF

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.706
SUCH SHOULD. NEVER ATTRACT THE

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.775
ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS JUST

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.844
SEEMS WRONG TO ME. ANOTHER

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.846
SIMPLE MATTER OF FACT THE RISE

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.681
IN PROFITS HAS BEEN HISTORIC AND

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.649
HAS EXPLAINED FAR FAR MORE OF

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:24.618
THE RISE IN PRICES OVER THE PAST

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:27.354
YEAR THEN LABOR COSTS OR IMPORT

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:32.493
TARIFFS. SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.895
TO EXAMINE AND TALK ABOUT- COME

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:37.664

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.566

HAVE KETCHUP OR SALSA OR

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:37.123

01:51:41.494 --> 01:51:45.999

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:57.477
POLICY OR AGRICULTURAL POLICY OR

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:59.679
EVEN LABOR POLICY LIKE WHAT IS

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:02.215
CALIFORNIA DOING THAT'S PUTTING-

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.150
STAPLES THAT WE ALL DEPEND UPON.

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:06.719
SOMEWHERE ELSE AT RISK BECAUSE

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:10.924
CALIFORNIA'S- WORKING AGAINST-

YOU KNOW THE PRODUCTION OF THESE

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:14.794
THINGS. YEAH I MEAN THAT'S A

01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:15.428
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION-

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:16.362
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY ENOUGH MISTER

01:52:16.429 --> 01:52:18.131
REAVIS- WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:20.266
HEARING TOMORROW- THEY GOT

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.035
POSTPONED AND I WAS GONNA TALK.

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:23.503
ABOUT THAT THAT SORT OF VERY

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:25.438
ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:26.239
COMPETITIVENESS- AND I THINK

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:28.174
THAT'S YOU KNOW I'M I MEAN ALL

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:29.109
DUE RESPECT BUT AS I WAS

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:31.544
LISTENING TO THE HEARING I MEAN

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:32.846
EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMED THE FOOD

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:33.947
WOULD BE THERE. YOU KNOW THEY

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:36.349
NEED MORE MONEY TO BUY IT THAT

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.217
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THERE RIGHT

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.552
NOBODY NOBODY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE

01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:40.253
NEED TO HELP OUR FRMERS GROW

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.322
MORE FOOD- AND I THINK THAT'S

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:43.656
WHY RIGHT- AND SO BECAUSE

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:44.357
EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMES THAT THAT

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.526
THAT WILL HAPPEN- BUT THAT'S

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.894
CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE AND IF

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.195

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:51.698

IS SECURE AND ALL THAT HAS TO DO

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:03.243
WITH THE COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR-

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:04.444
FARMERS AND RANCHERS BECAUSE

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.845
THEY ARE COMPETING AGAINST

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:08.681

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:17.857
STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE HELD OUR

01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:19.692

JUST HIRING SOMEBODY IS. MORE

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:25.265
THAN DOUBLE HERE THAT IN THE

DOLLARS AND IN REALITY THAT IS.

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:39.946

INPUT COSTS. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:02.028
MORE THAN THEY ARE- IT. TO OUR

QUALITY AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS ARE

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:04.770
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR LOW

INCOME AMERICANS AND U. S. FOOD

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:08.808

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.543
THANK YOU FOR HAVING THEM ON-

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.211
AMERICANS CONSUME ON AVERAGE

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:13.312
FIVE CANS OF FRUITS AND

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:14.380
VEGETABLES PER WEEK. BUT

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:16.415
RECIPIENTS OF SNAP AND WEBER

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:18.351
CONSUME SEVEN POINT ONE CANCER

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:20.887
FREAKS IN VEGETABLES. 25% OF THE

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:22.522
FRUIT CONSUMED AN AVERAGE

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:26.058
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE CAN'T.

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:29.095
32% FOR SNAP AND WHAT HOUSEHOLDS

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:30.530
. JUST UNDER ONE THIRD OF

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:31.631
VEGETABLES FOR THE AVERAGE

01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:34.534
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD 39% OF SNACKS

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.137
AND WITH HOUSEHOLDS. AN 56% OF

01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:39.839
THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD WILL CALL

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.507
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD THINK THAT

01:59:41.574 --> 01:59:44.110
CANNED FOOD IS INCREDIBLY

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:45.611
IMPORTANT FOR THEIR NUTRITION

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:49.148
FOR THEIR FAMILY 67% OF SNACKS

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.950
AND WITH RECIPIENTS I BELIEVE

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:52.051
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:55.454
THE HEALTH. OF THEIR FAMILY. THE

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:58.224
MINUTES GIPSON I KNOW YOU'RE

01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:01.527
RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT- IT IS

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.896
POSSIBLE THAT LIMITED STEEL

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:07.700
SUPPLY WILL RESULT IN SOME CROP

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.768
AND FOOD PRODUCTS NOT BEING

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:12.138
CAN'T. REPEAT WE HAVE THE

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:13.439
POTENTIAL THAT WE WILL HAVE

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:16.309
CROPS THAT WON'T BE CAN'T THESE

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:18.811
ARE CROPS THAT. THEY'RE NOT

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.413
GONNA BE SOLD IN OTHER MARKETS

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:22.081
THE GROUND GROWN SPECIFICALLY

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:24.150
FOR CANNING THEY WILL BE TOLD

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.284
UNDER OR NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:27.687
WILL RUN OUT OF SUPPLIES IN

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:29.555
ORDER TO CAN THEM. SO WITH

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:30.823
IMPORTS OF CANNED PRODUCTS UP

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:32.892
SUBSTANTIALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY.

02:00:32.959 --> 02:00:35.194
BECAUSE OF OUR TARIFFS WHEN WE

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:39.231
HAVE- BASICALLY 40% OF THE COST

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:40.733
OF A CANNED PRODUCT IS THE COST

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.302
OF THE CAN. 80% OF THAT NOW IS A

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:45.738
TERROR OF COST. SO AS YOU CAN

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:48.441
SEE CHINA IS ACTUALLY AND OTHER

02:00:48.507 --> 02:00:50.042
COUNTRIES ARE ABLE TO IMPORT.

02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:54.780
PRODUCTS FREE. TO WHERE WE HAVE

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:56.782
OUR CONSUMERS AND SCHOOLS BUYING
