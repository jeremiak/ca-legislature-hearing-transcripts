HELLO THANK YOU- FIRST OF ALL I WANTED- THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TOGETHER IT'S CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT WORLD RIGHT NOW AND FOR ALL OF YOU TO COME TOGETHER FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IS- IT'S JUST. ON BEHALF OF ALL MY YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I'M I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AB TWO FIVE EIGHT BECAUSE I A WITH A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN THAT WAS NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD AT AGE. SIXTEEN AND I'M- IT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES ON THAT PEOPLE ARE REAL EXCITED ABOUT SEEING. YOU IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS HISTORY THE ANSWER. TO STADIUM SEATS. ON TO THE TELEVISION SCREENS THAT INCREASES. ALL KINDS OF EXPOSURE FOR THE SPORT BUT WHATEVER THAT MINOR TO BACK. THEN BUT IN THAT SAME AREA OF EXCITEMENT WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING THE OWNERS. THERE'S JUST. THERE IS A PROTECTION OUT THERE FOR. A PROFESSIONAL WITH. BE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU IT IS ARE DOING A COULD FRIED COME. AND IT GOING TO DURING THE ON AND I'M A MINOR AND- THE WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHING. FOR THE GOOD. FOR THE ENTERTAINERS THAT WERE THERE I HAD TO ABIDE BY THOSE RULES BECAUSE NOW I HAD A- LIKE ONE OF THOSE DOCTOR CARDS BECAUSE I WAS IN A COMMERCIAL. THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE MY PARENT WAS THERE THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT MY PARENT WITHIN EITHER STRIKE YOUR VOICE THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE. EDUCATION THE MORAL. SO MANY DIFFERENT DOT. AND I WISH SO. FOR THAT. BUT YET THE OF MY PROFESSIONAL WHATEVER I DID THAT WAS NEVER THERE. IT WAS NEVER THAT PROTECTION CHAU FOR YOU TO THINK. THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE. FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE MINERS TO BEAR TO PROTECT THEM. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THESE KIDS ARE COMING IN AND AS GOOD AS THEY ARE IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL SPORT. EVEN BEATING TEARS THAT ARE ADULTS. AND SUCCEEDING IN MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY'RE GETTING ABUSED BODIES AND DAMAGE MARK THERE'S FINANCE. THERE'S BOB. ON THE PERSON MENTIONED THE- JIM SO IF YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS FOUND IT DRAWN UP PRETTY BRILLIANTLY BY DANA AND- I'M EXCITED TO PARTICIPATE AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN OVER FORTY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS OF THE MINOR AND THERE STILL IS NO PROTECTION THERE'S NO SAFETY MEASURES TO HELP. THAT WOULD LOOK AT THE HEALTH THE SAFETY THE MORALS EDUCATION THE CHARACTER AGAIN BUYER BENCH OF WHERE. MINOR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ARE PLAYING THAT NOBODY PROTECTING THEM TO SAFETY JUST BEEN IGNORED WE'VE BEEN MIRED THEIR TALENT BUT IT'S BEEN AT A COST OF THEIRS IF THE AND SO I I'M- HERE THERE'S QUESTION. AND I. YOUR TO THE BOARD EXCITED AS X. TO PAY THE BECAUSE- IT WILL. IT REALLY TO REFER FOR MINE THEY WERE ACTUALLY. BE ABLE TO OUT AND TRAIN AND COMPETE. IN KNOWING THAT THERE'S A SAFETY MEASURE OUT THERE FOR THEM AND NOT HAVE LIVES ROOM. BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND THAT THERE'S NO PROTECTION AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE THIS CALL. ARE YOU FINISHED WITH A PRESENTATION.

RIGHT AT THIS TIME- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE TO THE AUTHOR. YEAH I GUESS I DO- I'M JUST CURIOUS SO MINOR HERE BEING UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. SO A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S- GOING TO GO TO A SPORTS CONVENTION IN A CONVENTION CENTER TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS TO THE TABLE LET'S SAY OR TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE BUT MOST OF THOSE VENUES THEY SELL ALCOHOL SOMEWHERE ON PREMISES SO THAT WOULD APPLY TO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A GUARD OR SOMEBODY WITH EVEN AT THAT AGE RESUMING. OKAY I'M I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT FOR. NOW FOR THESE MINERS TO HAVE. A AN ADULT WITH THEM- BUT IT DOES SEEM I MEAN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THAT LET'S SAY THAT. SOMEHOW THAT ANOTHER WAS ALCOHOL SOLD THIS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DRIVES HIMSELF THERE DOES THIS THAT SOMEONE THAT I TRY TO GO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE- THE MANAGER OF THE BOOKING AGENT FOR THAT. ROLE WOULD PUT THIS BILL PRETTY MUCH WHICH IN LINE WAS FOR WERE DOING WAS STATED A YOUNG ENTERTAINER. SO THERE REALLY- TO PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THIS YOUR THAT THIS IN EUROPE THAT YOU. MENTION IT DOES HAPPEN YOU KNOW TODAY WAS THE A YOUNG ENTERTAINER. AND THIS ONE JUST APPLY THE SAME TO THE YOUNG ATHLETES. OKAY. DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE NO I DID I UNDERSTAND THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY IF THE BOOK THERE- IF THEY DO THEIR OWN BOOKING RIGHT SO IF THE YOUNG PERSON DOES THERE ARE MAKES THEIR OWN ARRANGEMENTS THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY- SO THIS IS REALLY AIMED AT THOSE THAT ARE AT THE STATURE OF HAVING A PROFESSIONAL MAN DOING THE BOOKINGS WHICH GIVES ME THAT ACTUALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK. ATHLETES WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED PROFESSIONAL BUT ARE. A PROFESSIONAL SURFER OR- YOU KNOW WHERE THEY- MAY NOT HAPPEN THE MANAGER. THAT YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT THEIR PARENTS TO BE PROSECUTED BECAUSE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD OR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD. THEMSELVES GOES TO SOME.
