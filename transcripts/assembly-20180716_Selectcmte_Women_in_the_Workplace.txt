NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH IS CREATING THAT SPACE FOR WOMEN. TO KEEP WORKING AND AND HELPING OF WILL HAVE A GROUP YOU HAVE A GROUP OF FROM A THOUGHT AS WE GO TO TRAIN OF THEIR THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS NOT ONLY WOMEN BUT TRAIN THEM. ON ON THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND HOW TO SPEAK UP IN THE WORKPLACE. IT SAYS TO ME GET NOTHING I'M UP A YOUNG BALK MEDEVAC AIMLESSLY AND ALL LA MAS AND THEN I'M IN BOTH STATE ABLE TO YOU KNOW THINK OF THAT. IF NOTHING ELSE WE WANT TO HOLD MORE TREATMENT. WHEN TO CONTINUE TO HOLD MORE TRAINING IN THE WORKPLACE IS? MY NAME IS TINEA PALMER. AND I WORKED AT THE JW MARRIOTT AMERICO IN SANTA MONICA. FOR ALMOST A YEAR AS A HOSTESS. AT THE RESTAURANT. WHILE I WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL OR AT THE HOTEL. I BOTH EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND WITNESSED THE IMPACTS OF DISPARAGEMENT. WHEN AN INSTANCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS REPORTED? AMERIGO IS OPERATED BY COLUMBIA SUSSEX. A COMPANY WHICH HAS FACED ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND MULTIPLE HOTELS. IT OPERATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THAT IF. WORKERS ARE UNABLE. TO FEEL SAFE OPERATING SUCH A REPORTER AND PRAYER -- I BELIEVE THAT IT WORKERS ARE UNABLE TO FEEL SAFE. WHEN REPORTING -- SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THE HAS WITH TILL THE HOSPITALITY CULTURE. WILL NEVER CHANGE. AT THE LEMERRE GO. IT WAS NORMAL TO JOKE AROUND ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WHEN TIME ASSISTANT OF THE ASSISTANT FOOD AND BEVERAGE MANAGER MARK TONG? MADE AN EXPLICIT JOKE TO ME. AND THE SERVER. NAME JAMES. ABOUT MY CO WORKERS HIGH. SAYING HE ONLY DEEDS GROWTH CENTER THAT HIGH BECAUSE IT'S EASIER ACCESS TO HIS PRIVATE AREA. I WAS SHOCKED. THAT A COMMENT LIKE THIS WOULD MAKE. IT WOULD COME FROM AN ASSISTANT MANAGER. WHEN ONE OF MY MALE CO WORKERS BEGAN TO MAKE ON UNWANTED ADVANCEMENTS TOWARDS ME I DO FEEL LIKE I MANAGER WHO? WOULD JOKE ABOUT WOMEN. WOULD MAKE -- WOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND I FEARED -- THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING OUT. THIS ISN'T IT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS IMPACTED GENERATIONS A HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS. WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER? BUT WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER IMMIGRATED FROM THE UNITED A TO THE UNITED STATES FROM THAILAND. SHE WORKED AS A HOUSEKEEPER AT A SMALL MOTEL. IN KANSAS. WHEN I STARTED TO TALK TO HER ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCES AL AMERIGO? SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS CLEANING OUTSIDE OF THE MOTEL ROOM. AND ANNA MOTEL GUYS FROM -- PROPOSITIONED HER FROM HIS CAR COMPLETELY NAKED. AS AN IMMIGRANT WITH LIMITED ENGLISH AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES SHE WAS UNABLE TO SEEK RECOURSE. I ALSO WITNESS THEM IMPACTS OF DISPARAGEMENT WHEN MY CO WORKER CAME FORWARD WITH HER STORY. MY GOOD FRIEND AND CO WORKER HANNAH. WHO IS ALSO A SERVER? TELL ME THAT SHE HAD A BIRD SHE HAD REPORTED BEINGS ASSAULTED BY THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HOTEL I HEARD. FROM THE CO WORKERS THAT AFTER HANNAH MADE HER COMPLAINT. THEY HAD BEEN CALLED INTO A MEETING I WISH MANAGEMENT UNDERMINE. HIM AS A CRUTCH CREDIBILITY. AND THE OTHER WORKERS IN THE RESTAURANT THAT SHE WAS ONCE CLOSE TO THE BECAME. THE BEGAN TURNING THEIR BACKS AGAINST HER. ALONG WITH ME BECAUSE THOSE WHO SEE IT WITH THEIR EVEN AFTER SHE LEFT MORE TORN AND TEAMS CONTINUE TO MAKE JOKES. ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND IT MIMI FEEL LIKE THERE ARE NO REPERCUSSIONS FOR THIS KIND. AS LONG AS BE AS LONG AS WE'RE TOLD THAT OUR STORIES DO NOT MATTER WHEN YOU PICK UP ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. THIS THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CULTURE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. UNFORTUNATELY ME AND ARE NOT THE ONLY WOMEN. VIA SUSPECTS BROUGHT IT IS TO EXPERIENCE THIS KIND OF RETREAT OVER THAT THIS KIND OF TREATMENT. AT THE RIVER PALMS RESORT AND ABOUT THEM. WOMEN CAME FORWARD WITH ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT. AND RETALIATION. AND THE CASE RESULTED AND A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR SETTLEMENT. I FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE IS DO COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION THAT WILL KEEP WOMEN SAVE FROM ASSAULT. HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION. WHEN THEY COME FORWARD -- SO MEMBER OF THE ROCKIES SOMEONE IS IN THE STATUS THOUGHT THIS -- BECAUSE FIT AND IT'S THEM I MEAN THERE'S NO SAFETY WHEN -- EVEN THOUGH THAT SIMPLE STATE IT'LL. LOOK OUTSIDE THE S. WASHER. OR LOAN US THAT THAT -- HIGH GETTING NEEDS HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS -- CARLO AND I'M A MEMBER WITH NO. AND I WORK IN THE INDUSTRY OF RESTAURANTS -- BECAUSE OF WHERE IT CAME. SO HOW THEN SHARED THE NEWS WATCHER. COOL MICHAEL PUT IT ON TOP OF YEAR KNUCKLE SONG WHICH'LL. MAN MAY. NOT CAUSE US. EATING THAT THEY MEET THE CAUSAL EVEN AS YOUNG WOMAN. I AM AND SO I AM I WOULD WORK AND I OF THOSE I WOULD WORK WITH THIS -- MEN. AND I WORKED AS A DISHWASHER AND SO THIS -- THIS GENTLEMEN OR SORRY MAN -- THIS MEN -- WOULD INSINUATE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO TOUCH ME THAT HE WOULD -- ONE GOAL PAST -- GOAL PAST THOSE LIMITS. EEO DON'T KNOW THE GOOD ONE FOLLOWED. THE MOMENT WAS TO COMMIT FOCUS THE AND COMMERCE OR WAYS -- OVER YET [INAUDIBLE] METASIA. I GO MORE GHOST STORY THIS EPISODE WE WILL STOP AND IT EFM LITTLE YOU'LL SAVE HER BUT OF COURSE LAWS [INAUDIBLE] THEY LIVE. MORE JUST BECAUSE IBM DOES THAT DO TO YOU ALL RIGHT FOR THE FOR YOU KNOW WHICH OF THOSE THROUGHOUT THE IN THIS THE UP. BUTTON ABOUT ABUNDANCE JUST BELOW. THE LOWER. ALMOST OUT MADE TO PUT ACROSS A LOT. ALMOST A PERSON OF THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF WITNESSING. AND SO -- AND SO HE ARM WOULD TOUCH ME AND HE WOULDN'T LISTEN MULTIPLE TIMES HE WOULD JUST KEEP -- TRYING TO TOUCH ME AND I WOULD TELL HIM NO AND SO I AM A PRAYER ON THE TYPE OF ANYTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE HELPED ON BUT I SIZE KEPT -- TELLING HIM TO NOT TOUCH ME TO NOT UP TO STOP HARASSING ME HE WOULD A I'D START INSULTING ME HE WOULD SAY YOU BELONG IN WASHING IN THE RESTROOMS YOU BELONG AT HOME TAKING CARE OF YOUR KIDS -- YOU DON'T BELONG HERE SO HE WOULD JUST KEEP INSULTING ME IN THAT TYPE OF MATTER -- AS LONG AS I KEPT ON TELLING HIM TO STOP HARASSING ME. SO JOIN LIVE HERE ON THE MONEY. WELL YOU TO SAY AFTER YET I SMOKE YEAH IT. IAN THONG SAYS MEDICAL TO GET IF DEVELOPMENTS YOU. YOU KNOW YOUR HOME ON THE FUEL SO KNOW THE A GOVERNMENT AUDIO. OLD RELIGIOUS THE CANDLE. AND SO -- MY NEXT STEP WAS TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I SPOKE. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MANAGER WAS HIS EX GIRLFRIENDS IF SO WHAT THE MANAGER SAID TO ME WAS -- WHAT YOU WANT WANT ME TO CALL THE COPS AND SO -- I JUST I TOLD THEIR I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. AND SO [INAUDIBLE] THE GOVERNMENT. AND ALL I ASKED FOR WAS THAT I DIDN'T WANT ANY COSTS AND LOSS THAT I JUST WANTED HER TO TEACH MY SCHEDULE MY WORKING SCHEDULE. HERE AT THE SCHOOL AND SET UP ALSO THE END YOU EIGHT YEAH GONNA YOU. ONE IS THAT A RADICAL BUT IF YOU'LL SOME ACCORDION WORKED ON AND SO THEN THAT'S WHEN US OLD STARTED NOT ONLY FROM HIM BUT ALSO FROM HER. SO ACCURATE LEAVE THE WORK PLEASE FILL US ALL NOT ONLY CAME FROM THE MEN BUT ALSO FROM THE ONE FROM THAT HIS EX GIRLFRIEND WHO WANTED TO JUST LEAD ME TO JUST QUIT MY JOB. HE ENDED UP EAST OF WHERE MOTIVATED BY A VERY POWERFUL SET UP QUITE A LOCAL MUSICAL BUT YOU KNOW IN THE MOVIE THE OWNER KNEW. IAGO STEALS A MEMORABLE SORENESS IN A AND SO I AM WHAT I CAN. I ENDED UP DOING WAS TRYING TO SWITCH THE SCHEDULE WITH -- MY OTHER COWORKER BUT SHE ENDED UP TO THE SWITCH ME BACK TO THE OTHERS. WITH MY OTHER ARM COWORKER. COMEY IT WHAT THE OFFICE OF THE REQUEST OF THE US GIMMICK IT IS SORT OF THE HUMBLENESS SCHEMATIC. ENJOY CHANGE THE SCHEDULE FOUR TIMES AND I ENDED UP ONLY WORKING OUT OF THOSE FOUR TIMES ONLY TO DAIS MONDAY AND TUESDAY. WHAT CARE ENOUGH LIKE HOW WHICH WILL LEAD US TO BE A GOOD ECONOMIC POLICY FLORAL AROMATIC? BOB GORDON MOST EMBLEMS METRIC TONS. AND SO I ENDED UP ONLY WORKING THOSE TWO DAYS BECAUSE THROUGH ALL OF THIS WHO WAS SUCH A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME I WOULD SEE HIM. IT WAS JUST THIS FEELING OF FEELING DISCUSS THEIR JUST THIS FEELING OF NOT WANTING TO BE THERE. YOU THIS IS THE END POSES OF THEM ARE GOING ON AND LEFT. AND SO I DECIDED TO ON TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AFTER SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER AND SPEAK AND SPEAK TO THE ACTUAL OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT. HE'D BETTER THE SYSTEM OUT THERE YEAH GOAL IS TO WE ARE YOU KNOW LOOKING LOW ON MONEY. AND SO I TOLD THE OWNER SLOW THAT I WANTED A DIFFERENT MANAGER THAT I DON'T WANT HIS EX GIRLFRIEND TO BE PRESENT AS I SPOKE TO ON TO HIM. NEED LOW OF MEDICAL GOOD KENNAWAY ETCETERA BUT GIVEN THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN. AND SO -- HE PRESENTED HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT I COULD DO ANYTHING. THAT IT WAS HIS WORD AGAINST MINE. WHAT CAN I -- INSTALL ON HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT I TOLD HIM MY GOING TO FIRE HIM AND ALL HE TOLD ME WAS I CAN'T DO THAT [INAUDIBLE] YEAH.

HE THE DON'T LOOK YOUR BUT OF A RECOVERABLE LOOK AT IT BUT WE PROBABLY COULD DO IT JUST FOR THE RECORD IN THE PUT CHEMICALS ON I'M A SEATTLE BUT I MEAN THOSE ON THE I'M AND SO -- AND SO THEY KEPT SWITCHING THE MANAGERS IN THE MOUNTAINS. I JUST WANT -- SANDRA IF YOU CAN CLARIFY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT HOTELS SOMETIMES THAT THERE IS A STAFFING AGENCY.

LAWSUIT AND ALL THAT EXISTS AT THE CONTINUOUS -- PROBLEM. ONE OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO USE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO DO ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU MENTIONED WAS THE PANIC BUTTON. I KNOW WE HAD LEGISLATION THAT WAS TRYING TO GET PANIC BUTTONS AND ALL THE HOTELS BUT THERE WAS A QUESTION REGARDING HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST. AND THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW MUCH IT COST IT IT WAS A SAFE GUARD TO PROTECT THE WORKERS CAN YOU TELL US WHY A PANIC BUTTON. IS SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU. AQUA SIDE HURT IS SOME READY I WORKING IN SOME AWFUL TELLS THING IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO.

I ALSO WANTED TO ASK THE NINE IT APPEARS [INAUDIBLE] THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING. ACTUAL HARASSMENT IT ISN'T SOME IT JUST HAPPENS ONCE AND YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT IT. IN YOUR CASE IT'S GENERATIONAL HOW DID YOUR MOTHER FEEL WHEN YOU SHARED WITH HER THAT YOU ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THE SAME THING AS SHE WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG WOMAN. WELL MY GRANDMOTHER NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT. PLAGUE HER EXPERIENCE. UNTIL I HAD VOICED MY OPINION ARE [INAUDIBLE] EXPERIENCE. SHE KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO BE WORKING THERE. AND IT WAS A GRAND. FOR HER TO SEAL A HOW MUCH HARD WORK. WHEN SHE WAS THE HOUSEKEEPER? WHAT TO REALLY COUNT EXPECTANTLY? USE THAT AS A WAY FOR ME TO WORK HARD. AND YOU KNOW KNOW THAT OKAY THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRIVE HARDER THERE WHERE SHE HAD CAME FROM BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN I HAD TOLD HER ABOUT THAT SHE YOU KNOW.

AS PASSING THE BILL IT WAS IT WAS A VERY -- WE WERE ABLE TO SEE -- SORRY TREE WE STARTED -- LETTING WOMEN AND NOT ONLY WOMEN BUT MEN ALSO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE RIGHTS THAT THERE'S THAT WE GOAL AND TELL THEM LIKE LOOK THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO.

HI SALLY THAT CAN ASSIST WHICH CAN GET NOW NOT THAT IT WAS PICKED UP BY HEALTH BOTH BY SACRAMENTO CA I KNOW. YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK I'M. A YES I THINK THEY HAVE MOST LIKELY BY -- DOT AWAY AND STILL IT THERE OFF THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT -- DRASTIC TEENS MANY MEMBERS ARE TOO SCARED BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S UNIONS THAT HAVE HELPED THEM. LIKE IN MY CASE MY UNION WAS ABLE TO HELP ME -- BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF MORE WORK DONE THIS KIND OF LIKE -- THERE'S LIKE THIS MAYOR THAT THE COMPANIES TRY TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THERE HAS BEEN CHANGE BUT IN REALITY NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR US. AND HE GOT SO -- ONE OF THE BUDGET OF THE MUSICAL. IN A PROPOSAL FOR A GIFT THURMOND LONG THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA. EITHER WAY UP THE MUSICAL PUT CAN LIVE ON SCHOOL DID SO. FOR A LOT OF GREAT MOMENTS OF CONSUMING THOSE -- SUBJECTIVE LIVE. FIVE ALMOST IDENTICAL SALINAS THROUGH THE SUN HAS A BASKETBALL. MODEL A LOCAL MEDICAL MONTH WE DON'T KNOW I'M FICKLE DEMON -- SO IN MY CASE -- I ALSO HAD A GOOD POINT YEAH WHO SHE ALSO PUT A COMPLETE IN THERE WHERE PAID HER THEY WERE GIVING HER BREAKS. NONE OF HER FIFTEEN MINUTE BREAKS AND THEY I'M NOT GONNA PAY JUST -- KEEP BY SAVING GIVEN THEM THIS CONTRACT THE WORKERS WOULD LOSE MANY OF THEIR RIGHTS AT THE WORKPLACE. SOUL ONS JUST LIKE -- JUST LIKE THE FOOTBALL HERO FOUND OUT THERE HASN'T BEEN AS MUCH CHANGES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I I HAVE REAL BASIC QUESTION. DO YOU FEEL SAFE. IT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE AND THAT YOU'RE STILL SCARED. AND THAT -- I WISH THAT THERE WAS. MAYBE WITHIN THE MEANS THAT DID. SOME COUNSELING WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET OVER THAT -- BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE AYE. I HAD -- WAS HARASSED YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD. AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR. THAT YOU NEVER GET ENOUGH CAN HAVE A JOB. BUT I I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN BE SAFE. AND THAT'S MY MY ROLE HERE I THINK IS LEGISLATORS TO MAKE SURE. WELL AND I THINK -- ON A COULD TELL YOU ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT A STARTING WITH -- THE JANITORS BILL BEFORE ALL OF THIS CAME OUT IS THAT WE GOT THAT BILL PASSED WITH SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT WE NEEDED. BUT NOW WE'RE ON AROUND TOO BECAUSE THE UNION DID COME TOGETHER AFTER THAT BILL -- WITH THE FORCE COOPERATION OF THE COMPANIES -- TO TRY TO START A PROCESS OF EMPOWERING THE WORKERS AND NOW THEY'RE BACK WITH THE MOST INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN THE BILL AND TO AND TO HAVE. IT AND I'VE BEEN TO TO LEARN HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BOTH PHYSICALLY AND LEGALLY AND THROUGH THEIR UNION AND I THINK IT'S GONNA I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE A MODEL FOR OTHER WORKPLACES SO IT. AND YEAH -- AND JUST QUICKLY AS WELL I THINK I'VE BEEN ALONGSIDE WITH MY MOM INTO THIS BY -- DO ALL OF THIS SO IT'S BEEN VERY LIFE TEACHING AND ALSO THE LOCAL IS WORKING ON ALSO STARTING -- A SMALL PROMOTE VOTER GROUPS WITH YOUTH I ALSO WORK WITH OUR VIEWS AS WELL SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT JOURNEY -- WORKING ON WITH -- MRS FLETCHER AND ALONG WITH MANY WOMEN LIKE MY MOM. TO PASS THIS BILL CONTINUE WORKING IN BUILDING THAT COUNSELING FOR WOMEN AND NOT ONLY FOR WOMEN BUT MEN WE HAVE A GROUP OF GRANDFATHER'S WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON ALSO BUILDING NOT ONLY FOR WOMEN BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT ONLY HAPPEN TO WOMEN. BUT ALSO MEN AND BUILDING THAT AS ALSO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT THROUGH -- OF THE UNIONS TO COME TO ALSO HAVE THAT COUNTS VIENEN HELL TO BE ABLE TO HELP OTHER YOUTH WITH IN THE UNION AND BUILT THAT -- FOUND THEY SET UP AN EARLY ON PROGRAM AS WELL. WE'RE GONNA TAKE. WE'RE GOING. TO FOR ALL WORKERS HOPEFULLY OUR ACTUAL WORKERS WILL. THE GROUND IF THEY CAN'T. THIS PART [INAUDIBLE] TO THE MOMENT HEY EVERYONE WHO PARKED IN THE OVERFLOW LOT -- ACROSS THE STREET YOU CAN PICK UP A PARKING VALIDATION AT THE AND IN THE FAR CORNER OVER THERE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE NEXT A PANELIST [INAUDIBLE] PLEASE COME. I'VE TO THE TABLE WE WANT ENCOURAGE THE NEXT SET A PANELIST MOST OF YEAH. AND WHILE THE PITCHERS ARE BEING TAKEN WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE NEXT SET A PANELIST. PLEASE MAKE YOUR WEIGHT. I TO YOUR SEAT. AND WILL BE GETTING STARTED VERY SHORTLY [INAUDIBLE] I'M LISTENING. AND WE WANT TO GET THE NEXT SET OF PANELISTS. AND IF EVERYBODY [INAUDIBLE] WHO'S PARTICIPATING [INAUDIBLE] CAN SIT. CAN GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN SO WE CAN BEGIN. WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED NOW THAT THE CHAIRS BACK SO. WE ONE LITTLE SO LET'S GO GET IN HERE AND HEADING GET STARTED ON THE GO AHEAD AND HAND IT ONCE MORE CHAIR. I THINK YOU KNOW. AND I'M EXCITED NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR -- SOME STRATEGIES TO HOPEFULLY TAKE THIS THIS ISSUE HEAD ON I WILL AND I WILL NOTE THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO CAME FROM THE LABOR MOVEMENT. I THINK THERE ARE THOSE OF US PROBABLY A LOT OF US HERE WHO KNOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT WORKERS IS -- THROUGH THE POWER OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND AND LETTING THEM HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB AS WE'VE HEARD SO ELOQUENTLY FROM WANNA. ABOUT HER UNION -- ABERDEEN FIRST CONTRACT FOR A PANIC BUTTON THAT'S PRETTY MAY SEEM I HAVE. NOT ALL WORKERS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE UNIONS AND EVEN WITH UNIONS WE STILL NEED. FOR OUR WORKERS TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK SOMETIMES TO FORCE COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL HEAR SOME EXCITING SAY I THINK WHERE IS EVERYBODY LENT IF YOU'RE. GOOD WAS STARTING READY -- THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN. AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE MY NAME IS MIGHTY LITTLE GOOD ASTLE AND I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITE HERE INTERNATIONAL UNION. AND THE ASIDE FROM HAVING SO MANY WOMEN HERE. NEXT TO COURAGEOUS MEN I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD TO HAVE HEARD FROM THE WOMEN ON THE PANEL. PREVIOUS PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE TO COME OUT AND THE PUBLIC IN WITH THEIR STORIES. SO I THINK FOR ALL OF US THE ISSUE IS ABOUT -- POWER IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THE WORST THE IMBALANCE IS A POWER THE WORSE THE ABUSES. YOU CAN TAKE ALL THESE LAYERS FIRST THERE'S THE LAYER OF WOMEN. AND THERE'S A LAYER OF WOMEN OF COLOR. THEN THERE'S THAT LAYER OF IMMIGRANT WOMEN [INAUDIBLE] UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN. AND WOMEN WITHOUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IMBALANCE IN THE WORKPLACE. AND IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD IN THIS INDUSTRY AS YOU HEARD -- LIKE HOSPITALITY. SO -- MENTIONED BY SOUND THOUGH WAS THAT TERRY NAY A RESORT AND I JUST. I'M JILL BY LAS VEGAS WHO WOULD THINK. THAT IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL RESORT AREA THESE KINDS OF A OF THINGS WOULD BE TAKING PLACE. BUT THEY RELY ON SUBCONTRACTED OUT WORKERS LIKE SOUND THAT. THEY HAVE A RESORT WHERE HOUSEKEEPERS HAVE TO ENTER THE ROOM -- ROOM AFTER ROOM ALONE -- THEY FEEL THE WHOLE RESORT FILLS IN ADDITION TO SUBCONTRACTED OUT OF THE OF THE REGULAR EMPLOYEES. SUBCONTRACTED OUT EMPLOYEES AND ANOTHER. STATUS WHICH IS J. ONE VISAS OKAY. SO THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THIS EMPLOYER IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EMPLOYEES. AND THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RIGHTS ON THE JOB LESS AND LESS AND LESS -- SO I JUST WANT TO SUM UP -- THE POLICIES THAT WE THINK OF WOULD. HELP THESE WOMEN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGAK CURRY SAID HOW TO MAKE THEM SAFE ONE IS THE CURRENT LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ FLETCHER AB THREO EIGHT ONE TO MAKE COMPANIES LIABLE FOR THE SUBCONTRACT SUBCONTRACTED OUT WORKERS -- JOINT LIABILITY IT EXISTS FOR WAGE THAT BUT A IT SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SECOND PANIC BUTTONS -- AS YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT PANIC BUTTONS IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- AND WE ARE. LAW SUPPORTING OUR UNION IS SUPPORTING. A DIFFERENT WAYS OF ARE REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE. WORKERS WITH PANIC BUTTONS AND OTHER PROTECTION SO THAT THEY COULD SPEAK OUT [INAUDIBLE] SEOUL. ON LONG BEACH THERE IS A AND INITIATIVE THAT'S PENDING TO BE PUT ON THE BALLOT. I'M JUST BY WILL BEAR THIS THERE'S AN INITIATIVE THAT'S PENDING TO BE PUT ON THE BALLOT. OTHER STATE LEGISLATION A. B. SET. SEVENTEEN SIXTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMAN MORE SEARCHING. THERE IS THE IN OAKLAND THERE IS ON INITIATIVE ON PANIC BUTTONS THAT'S PENDING -- AS YOU ALL KNOW IN -- THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS PASSED YEAH OUT OF WASHINGTON. THAT WAS PASSED UP AN INITIATIVE -- AT LARGE AND IT WAS HIGHLY SUPPORTED BY THE VOTERS. AND THEN AGAIN -- THE CHICAGO CITY ALSO PASSED -- A LAW ON THE CITY COUNCIL SO THEY HAVE IT IN PLACE -- SO THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION -- THAT -- SUPPORT THE RIGHT POLICIES THIRD WE NEED IMMIGRATION REFORM WE NEED. UNFORTUNATELY IF THE WORLD TO THIS PANEL THINK WE WOULD HAVE PASSED IT BY NOW. IF IT WAS UP TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WE WHAT A PASSED IMMIGRATION REFORM BY NOW. I KNOW IT'S NOT IN. OUR HANDS SPECIFICALLY BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO CREATE MORE EQUALITY ON IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE ARE -- THAT NO GUEST WORKER PROGRAMS EXIST ALT WITHOUT FULL AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF U. S. WORKERS WITHOUT PEOPLE RIGHTS THEN THEY WILL BE TAKEN OF ADVANTAGE OF AND THE LAST POLICY THAT I WOULD LIKE. TO RECOMMEND AND THAT IS UNIONIZATION. UNIONIZATION. UNIONIZATION AND SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING WITH THE WORKERS FIGHT AFTER THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND THEY FINALLY WIN. UNIONIZATION SHOULD BE A POLICY PERIOD THAT IS IMPLEMENTED EVERY SINGLE WAY AND THAT THE LAW OF THE LAND ACTUALLY GET IMPLEMENTED AND NOT JUST -- MADE FUN OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU CHAIR GONZALEZ FLETCHER OFFER THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATHY SPELLER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FEMINIST MAJORITY FOUNDATION. AND THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF MS MAGAZINE WHICH WE PUBLISH -- THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I BROUGHT COPIES OF OUR SUMMER ISSUE WE HAVE A FEATURE -- SUMMARIZING SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A RECENT NATIONAL CONFERENCE -- MARIA ELENA WAS THERE AND PARTICIPATED ALONG WITH MANY OTHER -- CIVIL RIGHTS -- AND WOMEN THIS -- TO OUTLINED SOME OF THE FEDERAL LEGAL -- ISSUES AND SOME OF THE CHANGES TO FEDERAL LAWS -- THAT WERE SORELY NEEDED AS WELL AS OTHER STRATEGIES -- I ALSO BROUGHT WITH ME AND I WILL LEAVE FOR THE COMMITTEE -- HAVE VERY RECENT ARTICLE IN THE STANFORD LAW REVIEW WAS -- COMPILED BY A NUMBER OF LAW PROFESSORS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE SPECIALISTS AND EMPLOYMENT LAW AND SEX DISCRIMINATION LAW AND I THINK MANY OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS -- WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL TO YOU AS YOU ARE FASHIONING -- LEGISLATIVE -- INITIATIVES -- THEY ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY -- I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE STRONGER LAWS BUT THEY HAVE IDEAS OR EVEN HOW TO STRENGTHEN -- THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS STATE AND I KNOW THEY WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON ANY -- SPECIFIC LEGISLATION THAT YOU YOU WANTED TO PURSUE I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD ITS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT. I'M ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS -- THAT I THINK TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THAT ONE IT'S NOT ALWAYS SEXUAL IN NATURE. BUT IT ALWAYS OCCURS IN GATED. ASUS AND WHERE THERE IS TREMENDOUS INEQUALITY AS MARIA ELENA SAID -- IN THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION AND SO YOU CAN ONLY REALLY APPROACH -- ELIMINATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IF YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU FORCE -- A DESEGREGATION WITHIN THE WORKPLACE -- AT ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL DIFFERENT -- INDUSTRIES IN ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS -- WOMEN ARE RELEGATED TO THE LOWEST JOBS IN EVERY SECTOR -- AND MEN HAVE THE TOP JOBS IN EVERY SEX AND IT IS -- IMBALANCED UP AT EVERY LEVEL WOMEN ARE CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN TYPES OF JOBS AND THAT JUST REINFORCES GENDER STEREOTYPES. IT REINFORCES -- THAT WOMEN ARE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS IN THE WORKPLACE -- AND AUNTS AND IN MANY CASES -- ARE -- THERE -- TO PLEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE CO WORKERS WHO HAVE POWER OVER THEM -- YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT -- WOMEN IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY WOMEN IN THE FOOD SERVICES INDUSTRY -- THERE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE -- AND SO THE LAWS MUST REALLY FOCUS ON HOW WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD -- THESE ARE SOME OF THEIR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT FEDERAL AND STATE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEY STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN FORCES -- LAWS AGAINST SEX OUT DISCRIMINATION THAT IN ADDITION -- TO JUST TAPPED TO CHALLENGING THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WE COMBINED A CHALLENGE TO THE SEX -- SEGREGATION AND THE STEREOTYPING IN THE INEQUALITY IN THE WAY WORKPLACES ARE STRUCTURE. BOB BECAUSE ONLY WHEN WE HAVE GENDER BALANCE AT EVERY LEVEL OF EVERY ORGANIZATION WILL WE SEE -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- REALLY BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR AND DISAPPEAR RAPIDLY -- THAT -- FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SHOULD ALSO REQUIRE ORGANIZATIONS TO ELIMINATE SEX SPECIFIC GROOMING AND DRESS REQUIRE -- TO REQUIRE WAITRESSES -- TO WEAR SKIMPY OUTFITS TOM AND I SUSPECT I I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE HOTEL WORKERS UNIFORMS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PERFORM THEIR JOBS -- IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER AND SO I THE STATE -- COULD LOOK AT LEGISLATION IN THAT WAY AS WELL UP THE UNIFORMS SHOULD ONLY BE RELEVANT TO WHATEVER IS ESSENTIAL AS PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION. I'M NOT -- TO CREATE A HETEROSEXUAL -- SEXUAL -- RETRACTION. TO STEREOTYPE THAT WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. SAY OH LAWMAKERS IN AGENCIES ALSO SHOULD LOOK AT HOW WE CREATE INCENTIVES FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ELIMINATE EMPLOYEE VULNERABILITIES -- IN THE WORKPLACE AND UNCHECK SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY -- OBVIOUSLY -- PANIC BUTTONS IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT THERE ARE MANY INNOVATIVE WAYS TO DO IT WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF STANDARDS AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY -- HEALTH STANDARDS -- WHY CAN'T WE HAVE STANDARDS AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WOMEN ARE FACED WITH ON THE JOB AS PART OF THEIR HEALTH? AND THE HEALTH OF OUR SOCIETY SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AS WELL -- OBVIOUSLY IS YOU PARTY HOOD -- HEARD A CONTRACT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS HAVE TO BE COVERED IN ALL INSTANCES MANY TIMES THE LAW DOES NOT APPLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TITLE SEVEN DOESN'T APPLY -- OUT ESPECIALLY TO SMALLER WORKPLACES ON THIS STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD BE VERY -- INNOVATIVE AND AND ADDRESSING THAT ALSO THE STATE HAS TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC POWER WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTRACTORS -- WHERE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED THE HOTEL HAS MORE THAN ONE COMPLAINT OF -- SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT STATE EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO STAY -- IN THOSE HOTELS OR TO FREQUENT THOSE RESTAURANTS I AND THIS AND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND THESE ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS GAMESTOP. I KNOW WITH RESPECT TO RETALIATION ISSUES THIS LEGAL -- SKY STANFORD LAW REVIEW ARTICLE HAS SOME VERY CONCRETE. GESTIONES FOR HOW TO BETTER PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM -- FROM MY RECRIMINATION IN AND OUT FROM RETALIATION -- AND AND THE LAW IS VERY INADEQUATE RIGHT NOW IS IT ADDRESSES -- CALIFORNIA STATE LAW COULD ALSO ENCOURAGE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ON THEIR PROVING VERY VERY EFFECTIVE. BY EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES TO STEP FORWARD -- TO BEAR WITNESS TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS THEY SEE IT AND AT THEMSELVES NOT TO BECOME -- THE SUBJECT OF RETALIATION AND SO. WE WE SHOULD TAKE A CAREFUL LOOK AT HOW THOSE LAWS ARE STRUCTURED. A COUPLE FINAL -- POINTS IS THAT FEDERAL AND STATE HAVE TO DEFINE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS BEING -- DE EMPLOYER BEING SUBJECT TO STRICT LIABILITY UNDER FEDERAL LAW EMPLOYERS ARE NOT. TO STRICT LIABILITY -- UNDER I I'M NOT SURE ABOUT CALIFORNIA LAW BUT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO BE FINANCIALLY AND OTHERWISE LIABLE FOR THE HARASSMENT CARRIED OUT IN THEIR WORKPLACES WHETHER IT'S BY A SUPERVISOR OR CO WORKER OUR CUSTOMER. AND THEN FINALLY -- STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS -- SHOULD JOB GET RID OF MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. SO. YOU KNOW TO SUMMARIZE THERE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR APPOINTMENTS -- WORK PLACES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IT REALLY BEGAN TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF PERVASIVE IN WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO RESTRUCTURE OUR WORKPLACES SO THAT -- THEY'RE NO LONGER SEGREGATED BY GENDER -- AT ANY LEVEL -- THAT'S VERY VERY KEY IN CALIFORNIA COULD DO A LOT YEAH. ONE OF ON A PERSONAL NOTE WE ALWAYS LIKE TO SHOUT OUT TO GETTING RID OF BY. LIMON I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY IS A CO AUTHOR HAVE TELL. GOOD GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU A CHAIR GONZALEZ FLETCHER FOR HAVING ME HERE AND THE ENTIRE SELECT COMMITTEE -- MIKE SPIT MY NAME IS MONICA YOU SEVEN ATTORNEY -- I PRACTICE UNION SIDE LABOR LAW. AND PLAINTIFF'S EMPLOYMENT LAW A TRADITION I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN IMMIGRANT WORKER RIGHTS -- OUT MY EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS BEEN PRIMARILY AROUND -- WORKING WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS IMMIGRANT WORKERS -- REPRESENTING WORKERS BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AS PLAINTIFFS IN LAWSUITS AS WELL AS THEIR UNIONS -- I REPRESENT VARIOUS UNIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INCLUDING OF THE PROPERTY SERVICE WORKERS A JANITOR'S UNION U. S. W. W.. I'M IN ADDITION TO THAT I DO HAVE. EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN NON LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES WHERE WE HAVE -- SITUATIONS WHERE I'VE HAD TO PARTICIPATE AS AN INVESTIGATOR AND IN THOSE INSTANCES -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS WE ALSO SEE THAT -- WOMEN IN THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES -- FEAR THE SAME OF FAILURE TO REPORT THEY ARE AFRAID TO REPORT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT REPORTING WILL RESULT IN RETALIATION. AND OFTENTIMES THAT RETALIATION MEANS -- AND RESULTS IN IMPEDIMENTS TO PUBLIC CONTINUING -- IN PROMOTING THEIR COULD HAVE CAREER OR BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO I'M I'M WAS GOING TO DISCUSS JUST FIVE ISSUES I HOPE I CAN GET TO THEM ALL. THAT WE SEE RECURRING IN TERMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND TO THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT WOULD ASSIST IN PREVENTING SEXUAL HER -- HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE. I'M AND THE THE FIRST WOULD BE TIME TO GET -- TO THE POINT OF THE FAILURE TO REPORT AND TRYING TO FIND LEGISLATION THAT WILL ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY IS IT THAT WOMEN ARE FREE TO COME FORWARD WE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IMPACTS ALL GENDERS SO IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN. BUT IT'S THE FEAR AS WE HEARD FROM THE WOMEN WHO TESTIFIED. EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. THE FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT. THE FEAR OF RETALIATION IN OTHER FORMS NOT JUST LOSING JOBS WHAT OTHER FORMS AS I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF BLOCKING THEIR ABILITY TO FURTHER PROMOTE. BLOCKING OPPORTUNITIES EVEN WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYER. I'M HOW TO ENCOURAGE REPORTING WHAT TYPE OF POLICY AND LEGISLATION -- COULD BE ENACTED TO SUPPORT WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD TO REPORT. EDUCATION AND TRAINING IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND AS OF THE CHAIRS LAW NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN THE JANITORIAL SECTOR IN THE YEAH LAST TIME BUT WHAT DOES HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN TERMS OF BUT WORKING WITH THIS. DIFFERENT MODEL TO EDUCATE WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES. A MODEL THAT'S BASED ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MOVEMENT. A MODEL THAT FOCUSES ON BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS -- WITHIN OUR CULTURE AND SOCIETY UP WITHIN OUR FAMILIES PART OF THE REASON THAT OF MANY OF LOW WAGE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR IMMIGRANT WORKERS -- PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURES DO NOT COME FORWARD IN TERMS OF REPORTING IS BECAUSE THE WAY WOMEN ARE TREATED IN SOCIETY. THEY FEEL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY WOMEN -- AS THE PROBLEM DOES HAVE LEARNED IN DOING THIS WORK. REALIZE THAT THROUGH THIS EDUCATION THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT WHAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WAS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WAS IN FACT GREAT. AND SO THIS EDUCATION TALKING TO WORKERS IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AT WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ARE REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO EDUCATE ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. YET THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A CHANGE AND I THINK. YOUR GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THE INNOVATIVE -- TRAINING WITH RESPECT APPEAR TRAINERS IN THE WORKPLACE OR YOU COULD HAVE WORKERS WHO COME OUT. CAN TALK TO WORKERS IN A LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND IN A TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING WORKERS WHO ARE SURVIVORS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO COME FORWARD AND FEEL THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN REPORT. WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION -- THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO DISCUSS IS IN FACT RETALIATION AND WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ON RETALIATION AND AND BUT YET IT'S INEVITABLE AND IT STILL HAPPENS. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH RETALIATION IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE. IT'S OFTEN HE SAID SHE SAID OR HE SAID HE SAID OR SHE SAID SHE SAID AND HAVING THINGS LIKE THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WITCHES AND AND I UNDERSTAND OF PENDING LEGISLATION. A WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT I THINK POLICIES THAT WOULD GET AT TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT RETALIATION IS. PREVENTED NOT ONLY PROHIBITED BUT LOOKING AT WAYS TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT DOES. AND IN MANY WAYS -- THE NEXT WOULD BE A SHIFT CULTURES IN THE WORKPLACE -- AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT TIED TO THESE NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT THAT -- MANY EMPLOYERS OFTEN SIGN WHEN A WORKER COMES FOR TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SO YOU HAVE REPEAT OFFENDERS WHO ENGAGE IN THIS CONDUCT. YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE FAILURE TO REPORT. YOU HAVE A FEAR OF RETALIATION AND THEN THE ACTUAL RETALIATION BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN INEVITABLY IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY IT WILL HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD. AND FAILURE TO REPORT IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEXUAL HARASSMENT. YOU REPORT IT LATER THERE IS STILL GOING TO BE SOME FORM OF RETALIATION. THE PROBLEM WITH THE NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IS THAT YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO SITUATIONS THE EMPLOYER SIGNS AN AGREEMENT. PROMISES YOU KNOW THE WORKER IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. CONFIDENTIALITY NO ONE CAN TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT HAPPEN EITHER THAT. THAT PERSON WAS TERMINATED AND THEY MOVE ON TO ANOTHER EMPLOYER IN THE NEW EMPLOYER HAS NO IDEA. THAT THIS PERSON ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND SO NOW THEY'VE HIRED SOMEONE WHO POTENTIALLY IS GOING TO BE A REPEAT OFFENDER -- OR NUMBER TWO THEY KEEP THAT PERSON EMPLOYED AND THEY KEEP WORKING TO COME TO CONTINUE TO REPEAT THAT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING'S CONFIDENTIAL AND YOU CAN'T DISCUSS THE FACT THAT IT EVER HAPPENED. OR THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT OR THAT THERE EVER WAS AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED -- IN FACT MANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS IN ORDER FOR A YOU KNOW A COMPLAINING OF VICTIM TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION -- BUT TO BE ABLE TO TO SETTLE THIS CASE AGAINST AN EMPLOYER THEY'RE PROHIBITED FROM SAYING ANYTHING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY TYPE OF RELIEF. AND I SEE THAT MY TIME IS UP I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- THE ONLY OTHER TWO THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION WAS JUST UP THE ISSUE OF HOLDING EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. OF IN THESE LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES WE DO HAVE LOTS OF SUBCONTRACTORS SO OBVIOUSLY JOINT LIABILITY IS IMPORTANT. AND FINAL POINT UNIONIZATION IS OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT WAY TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. GOOD EVENING I'M CARRY WOULD UNITS AND DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THAT SAG AFTRA AND OUR PRESIDENT GABRIELLE CAR TERRACE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT SHE SENDS OUR DEEPEST REGRETS AND NOW YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME INSTEAD BUT THANK YOU IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE -- LET ME START BY THINKING THIS COMMITTEE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO ADDRESS ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- HARAP HARASSMENT HAPPENS IN ALL INDUSTRIES BUT BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC NATURE OF OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THERE'S BEEN A LIGHT SHONE ON ON OUR MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR -- INSIDE AFTER AS A UNION FOUNDED IN FORCE -- WE BELIEVE IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS THERE'S A CULTURAL CHANGE NATIVE AND THERE'S ALSO STRENGTHENED STRENGTHENING OF THE LAWS -- A COUPLE OF THESE BILLS ARE CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE SUPPORT. TO BETTER PROTECT OUR MEMBERS -- BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. SENATORS HANNAH BETH JACKSON AND CONNIE LEYVA -- AND IT JUST A COUPLE OF TO HIGHLIGHTS OF THE IDEAS THAT WE SUPPORT -- TO PROTECT OUR OUR SITE AFTER MEMBERS ARE EXPANDING MANDATORY SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IN THE WORKFORCE -- LIMITING THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO FORCE EMPLOYEES TO SIGN NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT -- PROHIBITING EMPLOYERS FROM RETALIATING AGAINST VICTIMS OR WITNESSES -- LIMITING THE ABUSE OF FORCED ARBITRATION -- PROVISIONS AS THEY APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES -- AND ALSO PROHIBITING SECRET SETTLEMENTS -- CASES UNLESS THE VICTIM WANTS IT SECRET MRS BEEN ACUTE ISSUE AS YOU KNOW IN IN ENTERTAINMENT -- I JUST LIKE TO TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS THAT WE AS THE UNION ARE DOING -- TO HELP OUR MEMBERS AND TO SHIELD THEM FROM THESE ISSUES OF HARASSMENT -- OUR EFFORTS INCLUDE A MEMBER EDUCATION THROUGH INDUSTRY PANELS -- WE HELD ONE LAST SEPTEMBER WITH GLORIA ALLRED AT OUR OFFICES -- WE ALSO HAD A MEMBERS ONLY BRIEFING IN MARCH WITH SENATORS AYE LEYVA AND JACKSON -- AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED SOMETHING CALLED -- GUIDELINE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT -- BANDS AUDITIONS IN HOTEL ROOMS AND PRIVATE RESIDENCES. SO THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MEMBERS -- YEAH. YEAH AND ALSO ESTABLISHED A CODE OF CONDUCT -- OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT -- AT CONTAINS VERY EXPLICIT PROVISIONS GOVERNING WORKPLACE RULES AND SAFETY AROUND SEX SCENES -- BUT WE'RE GOING THE EXTRA STEP -- WE'RE INCREASING THE UNIONS CAPACITY. SUPPORT MEMBERS TO FACE HARASSMENT -- THE FARM MEMBERS WE NEED TO MAKE REPORT WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE THEY CAN CALL WE INVESTIGATE ALL THE COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE -- AND RESPOND IMMEDIATELY -- THAT'S THE A BRIEF SORT OF SNAPSHOT INCLUDING I JUST WANTED AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW UNIONS HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER IN THIS FIGHT -- WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THIS TABLE -- AND BECAUSE OF THE COURAGE AND HARD WORK OF SO MANY LAWMAKERS ARE UNION LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS -- THE NEXT GENERATION LINE TERRA DIFFERENT WORK ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU. INTERESTED IN NOW AS A LEGISLATOR AS A NEW LEGISLATOR -- I ALSO THOUGHT OF CATHY -- THE STANDARDS THAT YOU MENTION YOU KNOW WE HAVE HEALTH STANDARDS ARE RESTAURANTS HAVE A LETTER. BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW CLEANERS YOU KNOW HOW. THEY'RE KEEPING US YOU KNOW TO THOSE STANDARDS YOU KNOW WHY CAN'T EMPLOYERS HAVE THAT WE SHOULD KNOW -- EVERYBODY THAT IS POTENTIALLY TAKING A JOB OR DOING BUSINESS. PER SHOULD KNOW THEIR RECORDS ON ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND AND EVALUATE SO THAT'S SOMETHING. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT TYPE OF STANDARDS. THAT SHOULD BE THAT'S A QUESTION. JUST YEAH I THE ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND IMMEDIATELY IS UNIFORMS -- WHY SHOULD? WOMEN ARE WORKING AS WAIT STAFF -- BE FORCED IN MANY CASES TO WEAR UNIFORMS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE SEXUALLY ATTRACTIVE TO MALE CUSTOMERS OR TO THE MALE MANAGER -- AND AND THAT'S JUST ONE ASPECT OF IT -- CLEARLY THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE -- STANDARDS IN THE WORKPLACE ALSO. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO WEAR UNIFORM THAT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO YOUR JOB EFFICIENTLY AND WITHOUT FEAR THAT -- IT'S GOING TO BE AN INVITATION FOR THE CUSTOMER TO GRAB YOUR AND DOES DOES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING OF WHEN I SEE [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. I THINK YOU ALL FOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS YOU CERTAINLY PROVIDED. UNDER RAY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ON BOTH POLICY IDEAS AND THEN LEGISLATIVE IDEAS AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION IN THINKING ABOUT. THE LAWS THAT CURRENTLY ARE IN PLACE AND A COUPLE OF YOU MENTIONED ENFORCEMENT OR LACK THEREOF. THAT CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT WILL IT TAKE. I WHETHER IT'S FROM AN EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE OR FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE TO ENFORCE THE CURRENT LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT. WORKERS AT THIS MOMENT WHAT IS IT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. BUT I THINK OF AS SOON AS WE KNOW UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- LAWS THAT GOVERN IS THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT. AND THERE IS ONLY. REALLY A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SO IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT DIRECTOR AND KEVIN KISH. BUT THE AGENCY'S ROLE AND FUNCTION IS TO TAKE THE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THEY CAN CONDUCT -- AN INVESTIGATION IF THEY CHOOSE TO OF I THINK IT -- IN SOME CASES THEY ARE LITIGATING BUT THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO TAKE ANY CASE TO COURT. AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY WILL THEN THEY MAY CONDUCT THEY CONDUCT WHAT MANY MORE INVESTIGATIONS NOW THE ISSUE RIGHT TO SUE LETTERS AND THEN THE WORKER HAS TO GO OUT AND FIND THEIR OWN. ATTORNEY TO FILE A LAWSUIT. AND I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS ONE THAT -- NON ATTORNEY ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN REALLY DISCUSSING FOR AWHILE YOU KNOW IT IN THEIR MINDS I THINK YOU KNOW OF A LOT OF WORKER RIGHTS FOLKS DO A LOT OF YOUR TRADITIONAL. MAYBE WAGING OUR LABOR VIOLATIONS WHERE YOU GO TO THE STATE AND THE STATE ENFORCES THOSE LAWS. AND I KNOW THAT WORKER ADVOCATES WOULD LIKE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- ARENA -- AND AND I AND I DIRECTOR I'M BUT I THINK THE WAY THE LAW IS SET UP NOW AND THE THE ENFORCEMENT IS THROUGH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND SO I THINK -- IT IN TERMS OF OF OF ENFORCEMENT IT IT HAS TO BE THE INDIVIDUAL ON THEIR OWN FINDING AN ATTORNEY TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND TO AND TO SPEND TO SUE AN EMPLOYER -- AYE AT IN TERMS OF A DETERRENT EFFECT ON EMPLOYERS I MEAN I THINK. YOU KNOW THE PENALTIES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR THEIR YOU KNOW A WORKER CAN GET DAMAGES. OF NOT ONLY THEIR ECONOMIC BUT PAIN AND SUFFERING -- SO. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT MIGHT BE AT THIS POINT IS THE ONLY DETERRENT THE THE THE ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS THAT YOU PLACE ON EMPLOYERS IN THE FACT THAT THEY COULD BE SUBJECT -- TO ADDITIONAL DAMAGES BUT OTHERWISE IF YOU WANTED THE STATE TO ENFORCE YOU'D HAVE. TO REWRITE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO YOU KNOW I JUST I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE THIS IS AN ON GOING. THIRTY EIGHTY ONE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS WE TRIED -- TO GOD BLESS BE HAVE BUT COMING FROM LABOR MOVEMENT I WANT EVERYTHING A LABOR CODE -- WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO TO PUT SOME OF THIS INTO THE LABOR CODE AND ARE GETTING A LOT OF PUSH BACK DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY RE WRITE ALL OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. CLAIMS OR COULD WE DO SOME OF THE RETALIATION SOME OF THE INITIAL RETALIATION [INAUDIBLE] AND JOINT LIABILITY THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND PUT THEM INTO. THE LABOR CODE INSTEAD OF FEET UP AS SMEARING THE HAT AS A WAY TO ALLOW -- THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IF WE FUNDED A BETTER TO ACTUALLY -- AND FOR SOME OF THESE OR ARE WE JUST OPENED UP A PANDORA'S BOX. WELL I I MEAN I DON'T WORK AT THE DMV AGE SO I'M NOT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION IS BUT I THINK THE THE IF I WORKED AT THE AT AT AT THE DEALERS HERE OR IF I WERE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. ABOUT WHAT I WOULD THINK IS MY EXPERTISE IS ENFORCING THE LABOR CODE WHICH IS THE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS AND THE D. F. B. H. AND EXPERTISE AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND HAS BEEN SO. UP I'M SURE THAT THERE MAY BE A WHICH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER MAY BE ABLE TO ENFORCE -- APPROVED PROVISIONS RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT LIKE IT DOES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IT MEAN IT IS A REGISTRY. THAT REQUIRE YOU KNOW THE THE JANITORIAL CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER OF WITH OF THE DLC WITH THE DIR AND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS POWER TO ENFORCE THOSE PROVISIONS OF OF OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IT REQUIRES THIS TRAINING PROGRAM THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE AGENCY -- SO YOU DO HAVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOW IN PLACE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER I THINK THE ISSUE REALLY COMES DOWN TO IF YOU DO ANY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT IS THAT. WHO HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE AREA AND AND IN TERMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION LAWS? IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO THE LABOR COMMISSION. I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THAT. I THINK STRENGTHENING MECHANISMS FOR ENFORCEMENT IS VERY KEY FOR REALLY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS NOT ONLY FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT FOR OTHER TYPES OF SEX DISCRIMINATION. TO FOR DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND PROMOTION AND PAY AND AS THESE -- THE STANFORD LAW REVIEW ARTICLE POINTS OUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE TWO GO HAND IN HAND YOU DON'T GET A WORKPLACE -- THAT IS NOT ENGAGING IN OTHER TYPES OF SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION -- YOU ALSO GET THAT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS PART AND PARCEL OF BANNING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS DISCRIMINATION -- AND SO STRENGTHENING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE WHETHER THAT'S AND I TIME NOT AN ATTORNEY SO I I CAN'T. SAY IN TERMS OF THE TERMINATION LAWS OF THE LABOR LAWS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH TAKING A HARD LOOK BECAUSE UNTIL WE BEGAN -- TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE NOT RELEGATED TO ONLY THE LOWEST POSITIONS IN THE LOWEST PAY AND SEGREGATED IN THE WORKPLACE. WE CAN'T REALLY GET IT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT OVERALL -- I JUST I DON'T WANT TO MENTION THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF AND SALAS FLETCHER. THAT I SAW THE CONNECTION BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU PASSED WITH THE JANITORS. AND WHAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED. WHAT THEY IMPLEMENTED WAS ENFORCEMENT? THE PROMOTE BOUGHT US. I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE ANOTHER WAY OF ENFORCING AND NOT ONLY TO RELY ON HOW MANY. INSPECTORS THE STATE HIRES BECAUSE WILL NEVER DO IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. AND I'M SURE IT'S A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR MANY OF YOU WHO PASSED THESE GOOD LAWS IS THAT THEY SIT ON THE BOOKS AND MEANWHILE EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF VIOLATION SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF I MEAN AS YOU PASS THESE LAWS WHO IS IT CONNECTED WITH. THAT WILL HELP ENFORCE. IF I THINK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THERE IS A WAY -- FOR EXPERTS ON IN CONSTRUCTION TO GO IN AND THEN FORCE AND THEY HAVE TO BE RESPECTED AND AND ALLOWED ONTO THE PROPERTY -- BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SORT OF I DON'T KNOW [INAUDIBLE] DEPUTIZED. BUT THERE'S GOT BE A WAY OF DEPUTISING. A LOT MORE PEOPLE OR IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE'RE GOING TO BE. FEELING GREAT BECAUSE WE PASSED THE LAW AND THEY'RE STILL -- THOUSANDS OF VIOLATIONS. I WOULD ADD MAKE ANOTHER WOULD BE. TO I MEAN ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE F. B. AGE AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS ONLY A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES TO TAKE CASES TO COURT. SO IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN EASIER FIX ON STATE IN FORCE AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'D BE DOING AYE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH ADVOCATES ON HOW TO DO THAT -- IT WOULD BE FUNDING DFB AGE THAT THEY CAN HIRE MORE LAWYERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE MORE CASES TO COURT I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. THE EASIER ALL THE FIXES BUT ONE THING WE'D LIKE TO SEE A LOOK THAT IS -- EXTENDING THE LAW TO PROTECTS WORKERS FROM PREDATORS WHO HOLD THEMSELVES OUT. AS AS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A JOB SO WHEN YOU GO ON AN INTERVIEW OR IN ADDITION. THERE'S NO DIRECT EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AT THAT MOMENT IN OUR INDUSTRY WHEN YOU GO ON AN AUDITION THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THESE OFFENSES ARE BEING COMMITTED. SO WE'D LIKE THERE TO BE SOME SOME LOOKING INTO TO HOW WE CAN EXPAND TO COVER THAT AS WELL. I DID BUT I DID WANT TO REMIND. I WAS JUST REMINDED THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS DID REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE FDA'S TO DO TO HIRE MORE INVESTIGATORS. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS SIZE A PRIORITY THEY DID REQUESTED IN SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I'M JUST REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE INFORMATION WE'RE TAKING AN WHICH IS PART OF OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING. BUT AS AN EDUCATOR FOR THIRTY YEARS UP LEARNING THE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BUT THAT ACTUALLY TAKING THAT. OUT TO WHERE WE NEED TO IS AS IMPORTANT LIKE YOU SAY WE PASSED MANY MANY LAWS SOMETIMES THERE -- WE IN THE WEEDS IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT LEGISLATORS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW ABOUT IT. AND SO ONE OF MY SITES IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO IN FOUR HOURS AND HOW TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO REALLY USE THE HAMMER AS WE KNOW SOMETIMES WE NEED. TO BUT I WANTED TO FLIP THE EQUATION AND FIND OUT IS THEIR WORK BEING DONE ON THE EDUCATION PART I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROMONTORY IS ALREADY WHEN PEOPLE ARE ADULTS BUT MUCH OF THIS -- AYE EVERYONE OF US OUT UNLESS I HAVE TWO YOUNG ADULT SONS -- WHETHER WERE ANSWER GRANDMOTHERS ARE SISTERS. AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO SUGGEST WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE AS A TEACHER. WE KEEP LAYERING AND LAYERING THE SUICIDE PREVENTION AND DEPRESSION ABUSE AND TEACHERS CAN READ IT OUT WE HAD YET ANOTHER THING -- THAT THERE'S MANY THINGS TO EDUCATION BUT EVEN SOME TYPE OF CAMPAIGN OR THE SERIES THAT CAN BE TAKEN DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S ON FACEBOOK WHETHER IT'S IN UNIONS BUT TO MOTHERS AND TO FATHERS. OF HOW DO YOU TALK TO YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAY IT'S NOT JUST WHAT. ABOUT HOW DO YOU NOT ONLY RESPECT WOMEN BUT HOW DO YOU RESPECT EACH OTHER BECAUSE THIS IS A LARGER CONVERSATION. THAT THE THEMES ARE ABOUT RACISM THE THEMES ARE ABOUT -- NOT ONLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT ABOUT ABUSE THINGS ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR TOP LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES AND AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE WATCHING THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEY SAY WELL IF HE CAN DO WHAT I CAN DO IT. WHEN WE SEE IT DISMISSED AND A VERY LIGHT HEARTED WAY THAT NO THIS JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN? SO I WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO BE PART OF THE WAY TO REALLY WORK ON THIS SO WE CAN GET TO EARLY CHILDHOOD SO WE CAN GET LIKE YOU SAY WHETHER IT'S TOYS ARE THE WAY I ONE PERSON THAT I RESPECT -- FOR TRULY IS -- FROM ORANGE COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS -- A RUSTY KENNEDY WHO ONCE SAID MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE -- SOME OF THESE TOPICS HAVE EMERGED TO THIS LEVEL WAS WHEN YOU SEE RACISM WHEN YOU STAND BY AND WATCH IT YOU'RE JUST AS GUILTY. SO IT'S LIKE THE BYSTANDERS WHETHER IT'S THE CHILD ON THE SCHOOL YARD OR THEN EMERGES TO JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU SEE YOUNG KIDS FILMING. THESE HATEFUL INCIDENTS WHETHER IT'S HARASSMENTS OR EVEN MORE RATE. THIS IS A CULTURAL ISSUE HOW DID WE GET HERE AND WHAT DO WE DO TO EDUCATE TO GET OUT OF THAT. WE NEED TO HAMMER FOR ENFORCEMENT BUT LET'S TURN IT AROUND AND START LOOKING AT PREVENTION. ACTUALLY SCHOOLS HAVE THE NOVEL TITLE -- NINE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE -- TO ELIMINATE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ONE OF THEM [INAUDIBLE] THERE. SO -- AGAIN I MEAN CALIFORNIA HAS A GREAT TITLE NINE LAW -- THE QUESTION IS -- IS MONEY BEING ALLOCATED FOR ENFORCEMENT -- AND AND IT IS AN OBLIGATION OF TEACHERS OF ADMINISTRATORS OF PRINCIPLES AND ALL UP THE CHAIN NAM IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO BE. PRE VENTING -- DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT AS WELL AS DEALING WITH IT WHEN THEY SEE IT THEY ALREADY HAVE AN OBLIGATION WE WE SHOULD DIE PUT MORE. PRESSURE AND RESOURCES IN THAT DIRECTION. TO YOU THINK YOU KNOW MY ALMOST FELT LIKE -- MISS QUIRK SILVA RIGHT OFF OF MY MY THOUGHTS COULDN'T A LOT OF MONEY. A LOT OF MY FEELINGS TO WERE ABOUT A CULTURAL CHANGE IN IN NIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. PARTICULAR WHEN YOU HAVE ADMINISTRATION THAT'S GONE AWAY WITH LANGUAGE THAT I I CAN'T UNDERSTAND TO THIS DAY HOW THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THAT BUT HAVING SAID THAT. YUMMY COURAGE TO KNOW THAT WE CAN DO AT THIS POINT IN TIME THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE. A YEARS AGO -- WHEN THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER FIRST PROPOSED CO AUTHOR HERE I COULDN'T GET THE VOTES? I MEAN IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND THAT HARD. THAT PEOPLE REALLY. PEOPLE IN OUR HOUSE REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO FAR TO GET THE VOTES TO PREVENT RAPE THAT WORKED I MEAN WE COULD EVEN BELIEVE SITTING ON THE FLOOR THAT THAT THAT WE WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. AND SO WE'VE NOW GOT THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE TO GET THINGS THROUGH THAT WE COULD SEE POSSIBLE. BUT YOU HAVEN'T SAID THAT. WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH IT AND WE PASS? AND IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE WE PASS LAWS AND IF YOU TOOK A LOOK AT ALL THE LAWS THAT WE PASSED ALREADY NONE OF IT SHOULD BE HAVING A MAYBE EVEN COMMON SENSE WOULD TELL YOU THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPENING AND WE DON'T. WE DO NOT TOLERATE IT. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT ENFORCING LAWS WHEN NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH I THINK WILL AGREE WITH THAT. AND SO I WONDER IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE IN PARTICULAR WITH INDUSTRIES WHERE WE KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY. AND ALSO BE SPECIFICALLY TO MAYBE LOWER WAGE EARNERS WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR RIGHTS -- YOU DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE FEAR DEPORTATION WE SEE THIS OUR COMMUNITIES WOULD BE SOMETHING ALL STRUCTURED IN ABOUT IT INTO THE BUSINESS LICENSE OUR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU ENTER -- THIS A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY -- TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO GET BONDED PREFERRED THIS IN CASE THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO DETER SOMEBODY NAY AGREES WITH THE STIFFER PENALTIES AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT STILL. THAT HAVE TO BE THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT I WANTED MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOUGHT. WHERE WHERE THAT WHERE WE HAVE TO DO CULTURAL CHANGE BUT DO IT ON THE FRONT END SO THAT WE HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE BACKING THAT WERE CATCHING PEOPLE? COULD YOU IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT BUT HELP ME THINK -- UPON SET UP IN THE IN THESE PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES A DIFFERENT SORT OF LICENSE AND INSURANCE OR SOMETHING STRICTER. BUT REGISTRY OR SOMETHING ON THE FRONT END SO THAT WE WE ATTACK IT. ON AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN SOME THESE LOW WAGE INCOME -- INDUSTRIES ONE IF. YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THAT. I THINK WE JUST GOT A TAKE A LOOK AT SOME INNOVATIVE. WAYS OF APPROACHING THAT WHETHER IT IS THROUGH LICENSING -- THROUGH OUR MINIS UP MANY OF THESE -- HOTELS ARE CHAINS THERE THEY ARE PUBLICLY TRADED -- THEY HAVE LICENCES TO OPERATE IN THE STATE A CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS -- THIS COULD BE PART OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. I MEAN IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE WORKERS AND IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE AS WELL. AND SO MAYBE THROUGH THE IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY MAYBE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO APPROACH IT -- I MEAN IF YOU TRY TO LOOK LIKE WITHOUT A CONTRACT. IS THERE CERTAINLY ARE THAT WE TO PUT ON THERE THAT WERE WERE SOMEBODY FEELS THE PAIN TO NOT. Q. COMMONSENSE LIES. WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT THE REGISTRY BILL DOES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IF IT REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER THEY EVERY JANITORIAL CONTRACTOR HAS TO BASICALLY HAS TO REGISTER. AND THEN YOU'RE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDES THIS ADDITIONAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING AND IF YOU DON'T REGISTER OR YOU DON'T COMPLETE THE TRAINING OR YOU DON'T COMPLETE ANY OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. THEN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LOSE BASICALLY YOUR LICENSE AND YOUR ABILITY SO EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO RE REGISTER YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT INFORMATION TO THE STATE. SO MAYBE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THAT BUT TAYLOR TO A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY THAT'S RELATED. TO IN OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE BUT I THINK NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS IS IS ONE MODEL AND WE TOOK IT FOR A STATE CONTRACTORS. SUPPORT SO IT'S WE DEFINITELY HAD IT -- IN LA BEFORE AND I THINK WHERE NOW TRYING TO ESTABLISH ONE FOR PORTRAIT DRIVERS AS WELL SO. MAYBE IT IS A WAY FOR THE FUTURE THAT -- I JUST WANT I I I I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THESE HOTELS ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS THAT ARE. LOW'S NNST SEE I HAVE TO SAY BEFORE YOU DID IT YOU KNOW THAT OUR CALPERS HAS INVESTED IN SO THE POWER OF THE DOLLAR GO AHEAD MONEY LENNY YOU KNOW THIS FAR BETTER THAN I KNOW I YOU YOU HIT IT ON ON THE NOSE -- WE HAVE COMPANIES PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES. THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM OUR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THEY COULD IN ONE FELL SWOOP. THEY COULD MAKE A DECISION THAT ANY COMPANY THEY OWN. AND THAT WE ARE BENEFITING. WOULD HAVE WOULD STOP THE HARASSMENT PERIOD. AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY DON'T BENEFIT FROM MY TAX DOLLARS -- SO THEY CONTINUE TO GO ALONG IT. ENOUGH IT DOESN'T HIT HARD IN THE POCKETBOOK THEY ARE NOT GOING TO STOP UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING OF EQUAL POWER. SO I THINK THAT'S A ANOTHER WAY OF HOW THESE PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES ARE FUNCTIONING WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS. WE NEED TO BE PUT ON HOLD -- I WONDERED JUST COMMENT ON KATHY I APPRECIATE WHAT THE THE DTV ROB FORD. AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT ENFORCEMENT POLICY. I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW FOR TWO YEARS AND I EXPRESSED MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT. ARE THE POLICY THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER ARE WE IMPLEMENTING IT AS WE WERE HOPING ASSEMBLY EMPLOYMENT. ARE WE DOING THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE NEED TO DO ON IT. AND SO I'M TURNING THE TABLES TO US POLICIES THAT WE BILL PUT TOGETHER WE SHOULD TEST AND CHECK AND SEE IF THE WORKING CORRECTLY. ME THINK OF THINGS SOME SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT DO WE NEED TO CHANGE SOME OF THOSE DO THEY MEET UP UPDATING -- THOSE ARE SOME OF MY FRUSTRATIONS I HAVEN'T WHEN. POLICIES OLD WE DON'T GO BACK IN AND IT MIGHT JUST NEEDED REAL EASY TO TWEAK THE CHANGES ALL THIS VERY EASILY -- RENDON THE VISION AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE GET IN THIS WHOLE WORKING AT THE CAPITOL AND WE DON'T REALIZE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS THAT. HEARING A WHOLE NOTHER SIDE THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO DO THAT. UP A PRIOR PRIMARILY IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE ARE WORKING. AND MAKING SURE THE FOLLOW UP WITH THOSE THAT AGENCIES ARE THEY DOING THEIR JOB BECAUSE I HAD A TERRIBLE SITUATION THAT I'M WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE BILL WAS. THE HEALTH CARE DIVISION AND WE FOUND OUT DATA WAS GOING TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE. AND IT'S SAD. AND IT HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AND SO I THINK WE ALL SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE POLICIES WERE INTERESTED IN AND SEEING ISN'T ALREADY THERE AND HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT BETTER OR ELSE WHAT POLICIES WE DO DESIGN. ARE PUT TOGETHER IS A WE FOLLOW THROUGH I MEAN FROM YOU WERE LUCKY WE'RE ALL HERE. FOR POTENTIALLY TWELVE YEARS AND YOU CAN DO APOLLO THE GOOD POLICY IN THAT WHERE A PERIOD OF TIME WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT. IF IT NEEDS AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES WE CAN DO THAT SO I I I SAY TO ALL OF US LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING. IS REALLY WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND IF SOMETHING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MIGHT NEED TO BE CHANGED [INAUDIBLE] UPDATED SO. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR DISSIPATION ALBEIT. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WAS -- EXTREMELY ENLIGHTENING I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR JUST OVER A MONTH NOW AND THIS IS NOT AN AREA WHERE I HAVE TO TAKE EXPERT. THIS WAS A VERY VERY VERY EYE OPENING -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MON REALLY I ASK IS AT THE HEART OF MY QUESTION WHICH WAS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT IN IN FRANKLY SHOCKING TO ME THAT THERE'S ONLY A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ENFORCING -- I ALSO WANTED TO SAY MARINO LAYA -- I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING MY COLLEAGUE HERE -- I WAS TAKING NOTES REFLECTING ON WHAT SOME OF THE WOMEN IN OUR FIRST PANELIST SAID IN THE FIRST THING I WROTE DOWN WAS POWER IMBALANCE. IT'S SAY TO ME THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW DO WE SHIFT THAT POWER BALANCE AND WHAT CAN WE DO S. LEGISLATORS WHETHER THROUGH ITS. OUR INFLUENCE ALL OVER THE LEGAL PROP. OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT I DO A CHEF THAT PARAMOUNT'S AYE TWO QUESTIONS -- AND I APOLOGIZE ONE OF THEM MAY BE VERY DOWN THIS IS AN AREA I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND ONE IS -- JUST THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF REPEAT OFFENDERS -- AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT IT'S TRUE THAT THERE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL REPEAT OFFENDERS FOR US THE ABOUT THAT ALSO IN THE CORPORATE SENSE AND WONDERING IF WE HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT I KNOW A LOT OF THIS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FIND. BUT PERHAPS THERE'S ONE WAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED. A TARGET BAD ACTORS WHERE THERE'S REPEAT OFFENDERS IN THE CORPORATE SENSE MAYBE YOU HAVE PARTICULAR CORPORATIONS ARE BUSINESSES WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND INDUSTRIES BUT CORPORATIONS ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE BAD ACTORS. THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN LOOK OKAY THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF OFFENSES THERE'S A THAT A CULTURE HERE THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO STEP AND I'M IN THE SECOND WAS JUST A MORE NARROW POINT -- THINKING ABOUT WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO HAD SAID -- MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT REQUIRED TO MEET WE DO THIS ALREADY -- BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA PUT IN THEIR CORPORATE FILINGS THE WAY IN WHICH THEY COMPLY WITH -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- AND AND LAWS OF WHAT THEIR POLICIES ARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO PREVENT SEXUAL RATS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING THAT THEY PUT IN THOSE FILINGS -- YOU TO PUT THEM AT JEOPARDY AND THAT WHAT WILL HOLD THEM TO TO WHAT THEIR SANK SO THAT WAS ANOTHER IDEA. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME MOVEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO REQUIRE -- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO I BELIEVE IF YOU'RE A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY REPORTING LAWSUITS THAT THE CORPORATION IS FACING. AND SO IF THERE ARE SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUITS EVEN IN PROCESS NOT NECESSARILY -- COMPLETED UMPIRE SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS -- THE WHOLE FOX NEWS OPERATION ENDED UP WITH THE IT WAS A NIGHT. NINETY MILLION IT MIGHT BE MORE -- PENALTY -- BECAUSE THEY HAD DEFRAUDED THEIR INVESTORS BY NOT REVEALING THE EXTENT OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT PROBLEMS -- IN THAT NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT COST THEM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PAYOUTS AND BY NOT REVEALING THAT YOU WERE DEFRAUDING YOUR INVESTORS. SO THERE MAY BE A ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA -- TO PLAY IN THAT FOR ANY PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IT'S EITHER REGISTERED HERE THAT IS DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE. OR IS CERTAINLY A CONTRACTOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT I THINK WERE RIGHT AT OUR TIME SO I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS I ONE THINK THE WORKERS WHO CAME OUT TO TIGHTEN AND REALLY SET THE STAGE SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE POLICY. WE WE ARE GOING ALLOW -- PUBLIC COMMENT WE ARE RIGHT. AND AND SO WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE WE GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY IF THERE IS A ONE MINUTE. PUBLIC COMMENT THOUGHTS. ISSUE. THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO BRING FORD PLEASE COME UP YES. AND WHEN DOES MICROPHONE WORK OVER THERE [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] IT WOULDN'T.
