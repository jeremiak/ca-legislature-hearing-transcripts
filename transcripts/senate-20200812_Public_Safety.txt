OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HI MY NAME IS CHRIS ABRAMS ON THE DISK TWENTY FIRST LANA COUNTY AND I'VE BEEN A CREEK PROSECUTOR FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SOLANO COUNTY I STRONGLY SUPPORT pASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OF SIX THE NATIONAL NARRATIVE REGARDING OFFICER INVOLVED FATAL INCIDENT SINCE BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN FOR CITIZENS OF SPAWNING COUNTY FOR QUITE SOME TIME WE HAD THIRTY SIX OFFICER INVOLVED THE TALLADEGA LAST THIRTEEN YEARS BUT OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD TO HAVE TORN APART THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITY. AFTER BOB SHOOTINGS BY THEIR NATURE ARE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED BUT THE TWO MOST RECENT HAVE RAISE THE ANGER FRUSTRATION AND TENSION OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEVEL WE HAVE NOT WITNESSED BEFORE. OUR OFFICES RECEIVED OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS SINCE JUNE. DEMANDING JUSTICE IN THESE CASES. GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE HISTORY OF LOCAL HIGH PROFILE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. AND THE COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT. MY EXECUTIVE TEAM BELIEVE THESE TWO CASES SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THE CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT ARM'S-LENGTH INVESTIGATION REVIEW. NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE FAMILIES OF SHOT MONTERROSA AND MOLLY MCCOY THERE'S BEEN A TIDAL WAVE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FIGURES INCLUDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS LEADERS LOCAL AND STATE OFFICIALS. AND THE MEDIA CALLING FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW. OUR OFFICE HAS LISTENED TO THE CONCERNS THE COMMUNITY DUE TO THE PERCEPTION BY MANY OF A PERCEIVED CONFLICT IT APPEARED NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE ATTENDANT ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE INVOLVED TO PROVIDE THE CONFLICT FREE AND INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DESERVE. THEREFORE WE REACHED OUT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ASSISTANCE AS WE BELIEVE THIS OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEW WOULD HELP. PUBLIC IN THE FINAL DECISION. I BELIEVE THAT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN AT SIX KAMBOJAS THE GOAL OF INSTILLING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE. AN IMPARTIAL OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND AVOID ANY PERCEPTION OF BIAS OR CONFLICT. I UNDERSTAND THAT MONEY STAFFING AND RESOURCES WILL BE A CONCERN AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WEE TO HANDLE ALL OF THE OFFICER ABOUT THE CALORIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE THE AG DO LL BUT ONLY AT THE REQUEST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND I BELIEVE MANY REVIEWS WILL CONTINUE TO BE HANDLED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I'D SAY BERMAN I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY TIME FOR THE OTHER MAIN SUPPORT. YOU SHOULD WRAP UP.

ANYONE CAN LAYS IN GERMAN ON THE PHONE LINE IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT SUPPORT PLEASE CONTINUE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO THE KEY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THREE HAVE THOSE- KEY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE LINE. YES YOUR THAT VEHICLE DIRECTOR OF COURAGE YOU DIS UNITED FOR SORT OF THE JUSTICE. MADAM CHAIR COMMAND CHOIR FOR JUGGLER POINT CLARIFICATION IT IS THIS- OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS AMENDED. OKAY ESTIMATED SO MAYBE I JUST NEED TO QUICKLY. HERE ARE JUST AS WELL AS THE SUPPORT SO- LET ME QUICKLY OUTLINED THAT AN APOLOGIES MR GOVE AS WE'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO THAT. WILL ALLOW YOU AND WHOEVER ELSE IS LEAD OPPOSITION TO HAVE YOUR THREE MINUTES AND THEN TAKE OTHERS SO THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY STRUCTURED WELL I DON'T KNOW FOR REGIONALLY BUT THE BILL THAT WAS BEFORE US HAD- HAD INVESTIGATION. REQUIRED IF A TEACHER IF A. D. A. POLICE AGENCY REQUESTED IT. AND THAT WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT THAT IS THAT THERE ARE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES ARE LEGITIMATE REQUESTERS FOR SUCH INVESTIGATION THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY AND THAT IF WE WERE TO PROCEED WITH A BILL THAT MANDATED. ONLY INVESTIGATIONS WITH BY THE REQUEST OF DA'S OR- A LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEIR- PEOPLE WITH THEIR COULD BE SHOOTINGS THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED THAT WOULD NOT BE AND ADDITIONALLY WE MAY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE IS USING RESOURCES FOR AN INVESTIGATION THAT THE LOCALITY POTENTIALLY COULD OF INVESTIGATED BUT IS- THEN THE IN FACT THERE. ARE THEY ARE SHOOTING THE COST THE STATE SO IT THE R. INTENT OF THE AMENDMENTS WAS NUMBER ONE TO ENSURE. THAT AL DEATHS OF UNINFORMED THE CIVILIANS BE INVESTIGATED SO THAT IS TO PUT THAT IS RIGHT NOW IN THERE THAT ALL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE STASHED THAT THEY WOULD-BE INVESTIGATED THEN SECONDARILY. THE INCLUSION OF THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE JURISDICTION SO A COUNTY BOARD OF SOUPS OR CITY COUNCIL. COULD VOTE TO ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION NOT JUST THE DA'S OR POLICE AGENCIES. SO THAT IS HOW THE BILL'S STRUCTURED NOW THAT RATHER THAN IT'S USING THE TERMINOLOGY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SERVICES STATE PROSECUTOR NOTE THE MOM. THERE STATE PROSECUTOR IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO UNLESS THERE'S SOME A FUTURE ACTION IT WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE HOWEVER. WHAT THE BILL ALLOWS FOR IS. BECAUSE IF THIS POLICY MOVES. WE WON'T BE THERE'S A COST TO THIS POLICY SO ASSUMING THAT IT MOVES. THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN APPROPRIATION IN THE FUTURE BUDGET. AND AT THAT POINT. THE ISSUES OF. WHO THAT STATE PROSECUTOR IS AND HOW IT IS CONSTITUTED. AND WHAT ITS STAFFING IS AND ALL THOSE THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT. IN THAT APPROPRIATIONS SO THAT IS THE BILL AS AMENDED THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US SO IT BROADENS. WHAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE BY MAKING SURE THAT INVESTIGATIONS OF ALL UNARMED DEATHS OF UNARMED. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR INVESTIGATION THAT ARE REQUESTED BY MORE THAN JUST DE ACER POLICE AGENCIES. AND SPECIFIES IT IS A STATE PROSECUTOR SO THAT. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WAS THERE ANY THING THAT I CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF YOUR ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS THAT WAS INACCURATE NOW THAT THERE IS ONE OTHER ONE WITH WHICH WHICH WAS THAT YOUR SUGGESTION WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT YES. POTENTIALLY HAVING A REIMBURSEMENT FROM A LOCAL ENTITY THAT WE NEEDED I THINK SORT OUT SOME LIKE LOS ANGELES WE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONIES OF DIFFERENT BUDGET THEN. THE COUNTY OF ALPINE IN SELF YOU KNOW THE MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF A MATCH. A COPAY PER SE THAT SO HOW THE BILLS AND READ IT IT ALLOWS US TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO BUT IT DOESN'T MANDATE WHAT THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE IT USES THE WORD MAY NOT SHALL. OKAY SO. WITH THAT AND ALLOW US TO. OR OPPOSITION WITNESSES BEGIN OPPOSITION- MR GARBER'S DO WANT TO START. YES SO THANK YOU- WELL THOSE AMENDMENTS SOUND PROMISING THE LANGUAGE IS STILL VERY BIG SO ONCE FINAL LANGUAGES IN PRINT AND IT'S REALLY TRULY CLEAR THAT- THIS IS GONNA BE A AN AUTHENTICALLY INDEPENDENT- PROSECUTOR AND IT'S NO LONGER- GAME OF POLICE POLICING THEMSELVES. AND ALL THOSE OTHER TOPICS OF INTEREST AND WE COULD POTENTIALLY SUPPORT BUT WE'D LIKE TO BE A PART OF REVIEWING THAT LANGUAGE IN A PART OF THE WORKING OUT THOSE DETAILS. SO UNTIL THAT TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ONTHE RECORD. SAYING THAT COMMUNITY FOR SORT OF YOU JUSTICE. AND YOU KNOW ONE ORGANIZATION IT WORKS DIRECTLY WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WHOSE LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN STOLEN. BY POLICE. AND MANY OF US ARE FORMING A CAR SHOULD LEADERS WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF STATE VIOLENCE. IT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB FIFTEEN OH SIX. WE WANT TO BE AMENDED TO CREATE A TRULY INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR TO HANDLE POLICE ABUSE CASES IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY FROM ANY LOCAL DA OFFICE AND FROM THE CHINESE GENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S THE TOP COP. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND SO- THE OTHER ISSUE IN LANGUAGE- THAT WE HAVE. IS THAT EIGHTY FIFTEEN OH SIX DOES NOT GIVE THE VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS ANYTHING TO PROSECUTE WHOSE. RECENT THE EXCLUSIVELY OF THIS ISN'T AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM AND WHAT FAMILIES DO NOT TRUST THE PROCESS. SO LIKE TO GO ON RECORD OF SAYING THAT WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WE ARE REQUESTING TO BE A PART OF REVIEWING- THE LANGUAGE AND DETAILS OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR SO AND BEING A PART OF WORKING OUT THE DETAILS THOSE WHO ACROSS THE PAIN. ARE CLOSE TO THE SOLUTION WHEN THE EXPECTED FOR ALL MODELS IN THIS CAN'T JUST BE ANOTHER BACKROOM DEAL DEAL BECAUSE- HE LIVES ARE SACRED. BUT US TO GET OUT OF IT SO. WE'RE ASKING THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN. THIS PROCESS Q. I. WE I SHOULD HAVE TO PUT I DID NOT SAY HE COULD NOT SEE HERNANDEZ ARE YOU ON LINE. I AM MADAM CHAIR IF YOU CAN BE BRIEF I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. I APPRECIATE NOT SERVE HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION COMPLEX EMPLOYERS WE DID COME INTO THE HEARING TODAY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT. THANK IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION- OUR POSITION IS THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE VERY SPECIFIC INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR CREATED. BEFORE WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW FOR. A COLLABORATION WITH THE INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR. SIMILAR TO THE CONNECTICUT MODEL THAT WAS JUST ADOPTED BUT WE COULD GO- THAT IS WHAT WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BUT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S BEEN ONE PROSECUTION. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS IN LA THERE'S BEEN ONE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THE CURRENT APPROACH IS NOT WORKING. I THINK THAT THERE ARE CHEN. IN GIVING IT TO THE CHEN. I'M NOT BEING THE ONLY OPTION. WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO PURSUE A MORE INDEPENDENT BOTTLE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THE ISSUE. COMMITMENT HERE. OUR THAT. IS OUR POSITION RIGHT NOW I. AFTER ALL ADDED I'VE WORKED ON THE SHIP OF IN THE CAPITAL. WELCOME FOR THE CALL. NIGHT THERE YOU'RE AGO THE FRIEND OF A CREEPY CAL FIVE FOR REVIEW IN YOU'LL WANT THAT. THEY'RE YEAR WAITING VERY STRONG YOU CAN BE AND I'D REALLY DON'T WANT TO WAY ANOTHER YEARS. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE ON THE STOCK TODAY AND THE FORWARD TO SEEING ON THE LINE TO DO FOR HAVING YOUR OUT. TRIGGERED TO THE INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR WELL THANK YOU. I'M NOW MODERATE IF YOU COULD QUEUE UP THE- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND SO EVERYONE NOW WAS CALLING IT WILL BE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION HOWEVER. BUT THERE WAS LATE OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WHOEVER THE FIRST LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLERS I WILL GIVE A MINUTE SO. MODERATOR GO AHEAD. IN LATE IN GERMAN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION OF ABFIFTEEN OH SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAIN. ONE ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION. AS OF NOW WE DO HAVE ABOUT FIVE IN OUR QUEUE OKAY. I WILL START WITH NUMBER FORTY NINE NUMBER FORTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CORY SUBZERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- WE HAD COME INTO THIS- DAY OR YESTERDAY WITH A WATCH POSITION ON THE BILL I WE WERE NOT OPPOSED GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS WE RECEIVED LATE YESTERDAY UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR WE ARE NOW IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IT SUFFERS FROM SIGNIFICANT POLICY AND PROCEDURAL CHALLENGES. IT BYPASSES LOCAL INVESTIGATORY PROCESSES INCLUDING ESTABLISHED AGREEMENTS TO HAVE OUTSIDE AGENCIES INVESTIGATE OFFICER INVOLVED USE OF FORCE. ADDITIONALLY IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER A STATE PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATION REQUIRED BY THIS BUT WOULD AKE THE PLACE OF A BE IN ADDITION TO A LOCAL INVESTIGATION WHICH ALLOWING CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REQUEST INVESTIGATIONS. SHE SACRAMENTO. THE SITE IS DIFFICULT. THEY'RE ALREADY SUBJECT TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW AT MULTIPLE LEVELS. THE BILL INCLUDES NO DIRECTION OR REQUIREMENT THAT AN ENTITY THAT REQUEST INVESTIGATION BE GEOGRAPHICALLY PROXIMATE OR SHARE SOME LEVEL JURISDICTION FOR EXAMPLE IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE CITY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GET OUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A DEPUTY SHERIFF A BAY AREA COUNTY. AG IS NOT RESOURCE- EQUIPPED TO TAKE ON THE DUTIES CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL IN THE LOCAL REIMBURSEMENT LANGUAGE IS INSUFFICIENT. BILLS ALSO INCREASED LOCAL EVEN DEEPER INVESTIGATION THE REQUESTING AGENCY OR THE AGENCY APPLYING THE OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT. IN THE CASE OF AN INVESTIGATION MANDATED BY THIS BILL IN A SITUATION WHERE THE LOCAL AGENCY CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION THE LOCAL AGENCY COULD END UP FOR TO INVESTIGATION. THE SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES INCLUDING THOSE NOTED ABOVE AND THE PROCESS OF% CHALLENGING. CONSIDERING THIS VERY SERIOUS MATTER AT THE END OF A TRUNCATED LEGISLATIVE SESSION WITH VERY LITTLE OFFICIAL REVIEW WE MUST ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY. THE FIFTEEN OH SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARI. NOW EVERY ELSE OF A- THE- IF JUST NAME AND- YOUR ORGANIZATION. THE NEXT WE'LL GO TO NUMBER THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTERRES ON BEHALF OF THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION CLEAR INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR AND WE WILL ALSO REVIEW THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE.

ANNEX OF THE NUMBER SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS. CALLING FROM COMMUNITY FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND I TOLD UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. NEXT WILL BE NUMBER FIFTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. IN THAT BY CHANCE THE COMMUNITIES DENIED AT FOUR THIRTY IT'S JUST THAT SOME COLLEGE FOOTBALL AB FIFTEEN OH SIX UNLESS I MEANT THAT I TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT. PROSECUTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH. NEXT TO A NUMBER THIRTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. NUMBER THIRTY SIX OF THESE MAKE SURE NOT ON MUTE. EIGHT BUT HE CUTTING FROM COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND I OPPOSE AND LESS THE DEMANDED CREATE AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION WITH A INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR. AND ONE MORE REMINDER LAYS JOHN IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIFTEEN OH SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WHAT'S THE OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE. A SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU A I'M TO CLEAR ON WHAT WHERE THE BILL IS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE- I THINK THE OPPOSITION. HAS INDICATOR LEE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S INDICATED THAT PERHAPS THESE AMENDMENTS WORK IN THE AND PERHAPS THEY'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH SO IF WITH THE COURT WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR- THIS A MEASURE REQUIRES A STATE PROSECUTOR. TO INVESTIGATE IN FLORIDA FORSMAN TO SERVE FORCE AGAINST UNARMED CIVILIANS RESULTING IN DEATH SO IT'S AN ABSOLUTE A DIRECTIVE IF YOU HAVE AN UNARMED PERSON WHO HAS BEEN KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. INVESTIGATE PLEASE YES- CRICKET CLARIFICATION. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD USE THE WORD INDEPENDENT THERE BECAUSE IT COULD BE. BUT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN DOES NOT GUARANTEE IT IF WE IF WE VIEW FOUR IF THE VIEW IS THAT AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR IS A PROSECUTOR OFFICE THAT IS A SPECIALLY ESTABLISHED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND NOT HOUSED WITHIN AN EXISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICE OKAY THEN IT CREATES THAT POSSIBILITY BUT IT DOES NOT INSURE ALL RIGHT SO WHAT I'M SAYING INDEPENDENT I'M ASSUMING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY WHAT ARE WHAT I HEAR BEING SAID IS THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE CASE OR IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. ASSUME THAT THE AG'S INDEPENDENT IS THAT CORRECT IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY SETTING UP. AN ENTIRELY NEW BODY. THAT BE DEEMED END OF PROSECUTOR. OR WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL AS AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUPPOSED TO STEP IN- TWO SITUATIONS WHERE. THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BY IN A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MOST OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMES IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. COUNTY WIDE AND IN THE CONTROL OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THAT COUNTY SO. BOB THERE'S A QUESTION HERE APPARENTLY ABOUT WHETHER THE AG IS DEEMED INDEPENDENT OR WHETHER WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE ENTITY. THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T YET EXIST SIDE CORRECT. NOT TO CONFUSE THINGS BUT IF YOU'RE FROM THE OP. THERE'S KIND OF GROUPS THERE THERE'S THE LAWN FOR. THE V. OPPOSITE. AND THERE ARE SOME OF THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS IS DON'T THINK THE GENERAL OR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS A PENNANT INDEPENDENT OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK IT'S INDEPENDENT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE FROM THE LOCAL DETACHMENT SO THE POSTAL SANTA BARBARA. THUS WOULD HAVE IT WOULD BE AN OUT. AND DO IT OUTSIDE LOCAL D. WERE THE CO. AND KIND OF POLICE ITSELF SO I VIEW IT AS AS IN THE- SO WHAT THE MY PROBLEM IS OUT TO VOTE SOMETHING I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON RIGHT SO AS THE AS THE BILL WAS AMENDED THE FOR AMENDMENT. IT'S CLEAR I IT'S WE TO OUT THE WORD ATTORNEY AND WE PUT A THE WORK STATE PROP. WHICH IS AS THE CHAIR NOTED IN REALITY THE PROXY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE OF ALL IS ONE STATE FIND AND UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE IS A STAFFERS. OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE TO ATTORNEY. BUT NOT NECESSARILY IF THERE IS IN FACT THE CREATION OF SOME OTHER. INDEPENDENT QUOTE UNQUOTE STATE PROSECUTOR DEAD AT THIS POINT TIME DOES NOT AND- ALL RIGHT SO AND THAT WOULD THE CASE- IN A TWO INVESTIGATE LONG. USE OF FORCE AGAINST AN UNARMED CIVILIAN. RESULTING IN DEATH. IT ALLOW. LAWN FOR AGENCIES AND THIS TO AND OTHERS WOULD I ASSUME AYE THE DISH THE SUPER BORED SUPER OR CITY COUNCIL TO REQUEST THE ATTORNEY OFFICE INVESTIGATE SO THE INDEPENDENT STATE PROSECUTOR OKAY TO REQUEST THE STATE PROSECUTOR WHICH STILL AT THIS POINT TIME IS CAG BUT IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE TO INVESTIGATED ALLOWS THEM. TWO A SENSUALLY RETAIN THIS INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR IT COULD BE AT THE REQUEST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR SOME OTHER ENTITY DO WE KNOW WHAT OTHER ENTITY THAT WOULD BE EASILY STREET IT'S SPECIFIC IT'S WOULD ONLY BE. ARE THE ADDITIONS ARE. FACED A GOVERNING BODY. THE GOVERNMENT BODY OKAY JURISDICTION THE GOVERNING JURISDICTION OF THE AGENCY THAT EMPLOYED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL FOR WHICH THE- SHOULD THE DEATH OCCURRED. AND THEN SO THAT THAT. A FLEXIBILITY IF IT WAS AN ARM TO CONTACT AND THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT ENDED UP WITH OTHER DEATH OF THE PURPORTEDLY ARM. UP PERPETRATOR RIGHT OKAY AND THEN IF EITHER OF THOSE TWO IT WILL ALLOW THE PROCESS WHO AT THIS POINT IS BUT IT COULD SOMEBODY TO SEE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INVESTIGATION AND THEY COULD SEE IT FROM THE JURISDICTION THAT THEY HAVE. TAKEN OVER AND THE INVESTOR ON BEHALF OF. SECRETARY WRECKED AND THAT'S THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. YES OKAY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU I JUST HAD A QUESTION A COMMENT WE HAVE A AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE OR NOT BUT I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT THE STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOT TO DEATH BY POLICE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY BY RACE. AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN. THEN IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINE NINETY SIX THAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO THOUSAND FOUR. AND IT TWENTY TOTAL NUMBER OF POLICE. OR OR DEATHS BY POLICE OFFICERS IS ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE. I MEAN THAT IS A HUGE REDUCTION IS THAT AN ACCURATE FIGURE. DO YOU KNOW. I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION I GUESS WAS IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE USE HALF THE YEAR SO FAR TWENTY TWENTY THAT OVER MAYBE THEY WEREN'T ALL DOCUMENTED WHEN THIS REPORT CAME OUT MEDIA REPORT CAME OUT EARLY TWENTY TWENTY. I COULD BE SO COULD BE FOR HALF YEAR BUT IT'S STILL AS STUNNING DIFFERENCE AND OF COURSE THE NUMBERS ARE STILL ME. A THOUSAND P. KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S A- A STUNNING NUMBER. ARGUABLY THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF YOUKNOW- THAT CONFLICT CONFLICT- AT THE LEVEL OF YOU KNOW FIREARMS BEING. OPPOSED TO A POISED IN SHOCK BY. PERPETRATORS. AS WELL AS THE POLICE AND I'M WONDERING. A IF THE ACT GROW BY QUESTION REALLY. DE WITH IF THAT IS THE NAY. I HOME. POLICE ARE. WERE THE VIC. OF THE SHOOTINGS HAS THAT NUMBER GOING WAY UP. OR YOUR- THE INOTES. ROOM PROVIDE NUMBERS FOR CAL. NOT NATIONALLY. SO I'M SORRY SO I'M GOING TO I THINK MAYBE. YOUR STAFF PROVIDED. IT I'M NOT SURE THAT BE ALL RIGHT I GET THE REASON FOR MY CALL WAS. YOU KNOW WE KEEP THERE IF. REDUCE THE FINE TO TURN. THAT YOU YOU FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER IS LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT IF WE CHANGE THE RULES SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE. OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SHOULD A KILLED AND I WAS JUST WONDERING GIVEN THE REDUCTION THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF. FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF THESE INTERACTIONS WHETHER WE'VE SEEN IN A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I'M ASSUMING YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT I THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT. THESE NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN IN CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE ONE FIFTIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE YEAR BEFORE. I WAS IN THE TWO HUNDREDS. SO WE THIS IN THE INSTANCE. WHERE THERE'S AN OP WHERE THERE'S A- ATTORNEY LIKE OUR- OUR WITNESS EARLY FROM SOME. WHO ASKED PROSECUTOR COMMENT AND STEP IN. AND DO THE INVESTIGATION IT WOULD CREATE A PROCESS FOR THAT. RIGHT SO ALL RIGHT SO I MIGHT I GUESS MY POINT THAT. HOPEFULLY WILL SEE THE NUMBER OF THESE INCIDENTS GO DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO THAT WERE ONLY. LOOKING AT A VERY VERY FEW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION. THAT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE THE RIGHT TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT WE WILL BE SEEING THE REQUEST MADE IN THIS SORT OF DISCRETIONARY BASIS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN- ACTUALLY EIGHT KM- IN ARMS. INTERACTION ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL SEE THOSE AGENCIES- MAKE THE REQUEST FOR AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE CONCERN THE OPPOSITION THAT STILL EXISTS. IS THAT THEY WANT TO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THIS TO BE DONE- BY A STATE PROSECUTOR. AND NOT MAKE IT DISCRETIONARY I WOULD ASSUME THERE MIGHT BE SOME AGENCIES THAT WOULD SAY NO WE CAN'T AFFORD IT YEAH SO IS THAT IS THAT IN ANY WAY FACTORED IN NOT THAT I'M SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD BE A DETERMINANT BUT I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT THIS BILL IS LIKELY TO ACCOMPLISH YEAH I THINK AS A CHIRLA TWO. WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATIONS BUT ALSO THIS IS PURSUANT TO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND GETTING IMPLEMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SOME IDEAS ABOUT THIS THERE ARE SOME SPOTS. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A DISINCENTIVE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SAY HEY. THIS CASE IS RIPPING OUR COMMUNITY APART THERE'S SO MUCH DISTRESS BE LIKE A STATE PROSECUTOR STEP IN I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE HIGH PROFILE INCIDENT. IN VALLEJO THE CITY OF VALLEJO AFTER HAVING A BIZARRE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT REFUSED TO DO THE INVESTIGATION SAID WE WANT TO TAKE IT WILL PAY FOR IT. SO THE CITY ACTUALLY SAID WE WILL PAY FOR IT SO I KNOW THERE THERE IS A PRECEDENT OF A LOCAL GUY STEPPING UP AND SAYING. THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND I THINK IT'S TO BE AS FAR AS WHAT THAT REIMBURSEMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE IT WOULDN'T BE ALL OF IT BUT MAYBE SOME TYPE OF A SHARED AGREEMENT IS NOT UNREASONABLE. THANK YOU AND I MIGHT INDICATE MY STAFF HAS ADVISED ME THAT THE NUMBERS I RECITED IT TO COME FROM THE END OF LACI PEACH SO THEY'RE NOT. OUT OF THIN AIR BUT- THANK YOU FOR THAT. MS MITCHELL. MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW MISSED MCCARTY HAVE A VIEW OUTLINE IN YOUR OPENING STATE HAVE WORKED THIS IS IN THE BILL FOR YEARS NOW SO I. IT KNOWLEDGE THAT IN ONE COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS NOT BEEN A- ALL ONE EIGHT NON THAT I AM A CO AUTHOR. OF THE BILL AS IN. AND WHY APPRECIATE THE NATURE AND TONE OF THE AMENDMENT TO TAKE IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. YOU ARE REPUBLICANS. BY PRE. SENATOR JACK TRYING TO WALK ALL THROUGH. I'M NOT SURE THAT ALL THOSE NOT. WERE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT'S BEFORE. ON THIS I THINK MY CAN. ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CHANGE OF THE CONTEXT TO A STATE PROSECUTOR AND THIS NOTION THAT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE. MY CONCERN WITH THIS LANGUAGE IS THAT WE'RE NOT SETTING POLICY IN PLACE TODAY THAT CAN GO INTO EFFECT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SET UP A PROCESS BY WHICH WE ALL LIVE BY. ALL I HAVE READ AND TALK TO COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES LIKE CONNECTICUT WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO ARE STANDING UP IS INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS AND ARE FUNDING IT- AND SOUL I KNOW THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE SASH. IT CAN GET. CHAOTIC MY WORD. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AREN'T SENDING. UP FOR FURTHER DELAY FOR ACTION. THAT WHATEVER WE PASSED THE POLICY WE COME UP WITH- ON AS A GOAL FOR PROCREATION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT HAS A PLAN THAT IS CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE. I HEAR OPPOSITION ASKING FOR INDEPENDENT I HEAR I SEE THIS LANGUAGE CHANGE TO A STATE PROSECUTOR. I INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN INDEPENDENT UNTIL I HEARD MADAM CHAIR SAY WHAT COULD BE THE AG ANSEL THAN THAT SET ME BACK AND SO. I'M JUST CONCERNED THIS FIELD LIKE A REAL MOVE TARGET THAT IS JUST. TOOLING ARE AND I. PARTICULARLY THAT MY NAME IS ON IT WITH MISTER I DO WANNA MAKE. THAT IT'S SO THAT'S NOT. IN TERMS OF. SETTING THIS ON A PATH THAT IS CLEAR AND IDENTIFIED AND FINITE. THE FOLLOWING. CAN YOU DO A FIVE YEAH I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE IS WHETHER IT WAS THE VERSION THREE DAYS AGO OR THIS ONE THE IT STILL WOULD HAVE TO BE SUBJECT TO NEXT YEAR'S. BUDGET AS FAR AS FINDING IT SO IF THIS LAW BECOMES WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IN OCTOBER. IT WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE ON JANUARY ONE. THE CITY COUNCIL OR- THE AIR CHIEF COULD CALL UP AND SAY HEY. LET'S GO. WELL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FUNDED IN THE BILL PURSUANT TO THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET ACT SO. WITHOUT THAT WERE ON THAT EITHER WAY. AND SO THE HOW WOULD WE BECAUSE WHETHER IS IN THE- HOW DEFINED A STATE. SHALL I MEAN I I'M ON COME WITH THE- LACK OF CLEAR ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE PROSECUTOR. IS THE AG OR WHETHER OUR INTENT IS TO SET UP SOMETHING INDEPENDENT IF WE PASS THIS. SO ARE YOU SAYING THEN THAT IT WILL SAY THAT THAT THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ABOUT WHO THAT IS THEN TRANSITIONS TO THE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF I THINK DECISION MAKING PROCESS IF WE DECIDE WE'RE FUNDING THE AID YOU TO DO THE WORK OR FOR STANDING UP THE WHOLE INDEPENDENT ENTITY. WE GOT THE ALLUDED TO SHE OUTLINED THE AMENDMENT IS DE FACTO THE STATE PROSECUTOR BY DEFINITION IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR THROUGH THE JAN TENTH BUDGET PROCESS WITH OUR- CONCURRENCE OF NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WANTS TO HAVE. A SPECIAL. IN THE ATTORNEY. OFFICE OUTSIDE YOU HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECT WITH THE WHATEVER CALLED OVER THERE THERE ARE MODELS THAT SEEN IN. GOVERNMENT BUT RIGHT BUT RIGHT NOW. THE DE FACTO WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE STATE PROSECUTOR IN CALIFORNIA. IT AND I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY IN CLOSING THAT THE I DON'T KNOW IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS LEFT. WHEN WE WILL BEHIND AND TRIED TO DIVERT PA. I'M JUST TRYING OF EXAMPLES WHERE WE'VE LEFT. THE ULTIMATE. BECAUSE THAT'S A PRETTY. CRITICAL ELEMENT TO THIS UP TO THE BUDGET PROCESS IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S INTERNAL EXTERNAL. AG NEW STAY PROP. FIVE THAT- LEVEL OF I THINK LACK OF CLARITY JUST GIVE ME SOME COUGH ARE CONCERNED. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU. FEDERAL ARE. THANK YOU MANAGER I ALSO A FEW KEY I. SENATOR JACK. PRESS SEVEN MEMBERS THAT I DON'T HAVE SIDE I JUST WANT TO CLEAR MY YOU USED THE TERM WITH NO WEAPON OR UNARMED THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT IN MY- REAPING SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THERE A DISTINCTION OR IS ANY POLICE SHOOTING. WHERE SOMEONE IS BY. KILLED WILL BE INVESTIGATED. WITH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT ARE MAKING SHARE IT THE TO THE- VERSION HAD. THE DEADLY FORCE AT THE HANDS OF LINE FOR. A LOCAL ENTITY SHARE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE REQUEST TO GO TO THE AG'S LAST PASS OF SPECIAL PROSECUTORS UNDER THIS NOW ALL ON ARM TO WHAT AUTOMATICALLY. GET CHECKED OUT PER SE TO THIS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BUT NOW. IN WHO WHO WHO ORANGE UP WERE ARMED THAT WOULD STILL BE AT THE DESK. OF THE LOCAL AND- THE LOCAL DA THE TO SHERIFFS ORDER GOT BODY PARTS OF SAID COUNCIL. WHAT THE DISCRETION TO ASK FOR THE INDEPENDENT DESTINATION. WITH THE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHICH IS SORT OF IN THE MODEL WE'VE HAD AND YEAH CURRENT IT DOES HEARD FROM A WITNESS USUALLY THE GENERAL SAYS NOW. FOR THEM THE- YOU COULD SAY THE DIFFERENCE. CURRENT PRACTICE NOW IS THAT. THE BILL'S WRITTEN IF THE AN REQUESTS. THE INVESTIGATION WILL OCCUR IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. IT IS ALSO A CHANGES WHO REQUESTS SO RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A SURE OF FIFTY EIGHT THAT OUR CONSTITUTIONALOFFICERS THAT ARE ELECTED TO THE RESPONSIBLE TO THE VOTERS TO DO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S BEST IN. THEY WOULD THEN GIVE IT TO THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALSO A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER. AND THERE'S ALSO THE GRAND JURY OF EACH COUNTY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN IT GETS BABY PUSHED UP TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO THE CHANGE IS IT NOW IS REQUIRED TO GO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR WHATEVER OTHER MODEL- WHO WE SELECT SO I AM CURIOUS- IN CITIES THE CITY MANAGER'S CITY COUNCIL DAYS. AND CONTROL THE POLICE CHIEF SO I CAN SEE WHY THEY WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY TO BRING IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. COUNTIES YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE INTERESTING DILEMMA OF AN ELECTED SHERIFF ANALECTA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- AND SO THERE'S JUST SOME ISSUES THERE ARE I'M JUST WONDERING. OUR IF COUNTY SHE BE X. FROM YOUR BILL. WELL IN IN SOME AREAS OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO IN A LARGE PART OF L. A. COUNTY. THIS THE SHERIFF THE COUNTY IS THE CITY IT'S THE IT'S THE GOVERNING BODY IN IN THESE ON A CORPORATE AREAS WHERE THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SIDE OF ORANGE COUNTY CITY THEY'LL GROW WITH YOU SACRAMENTO LABIALS LARGE AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. SO I THINK THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE LOGIC THERE. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS SINCE WE IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. WHO WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE AG'S INVESTIGATION OF THE STEPHON CLARK. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL SOME WEREN'T PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME- THE LAST YEAR'S EIGHT AB THREE NINETY TWO WILL DETERMINE THE JUSTIFICATION OF FORCE IN THE FUTURE WHETHER IT'S- OKAY OR NOT OKAY AS FAR AS THAT APPROVED FOR USE OF DEADLY FORCE BUT BUT HAVING- YOU KNOW THAT AN INDEPENDENT UMPIRE CALLING BALLS AND STRIKES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SO EMOTIONAL IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE WE'VE HEARD FROM ABOUT. A I'M SURE YOUR COLLEAGUES MISTER DODD IN OUR CALLING THIS GRAYSON WHAT'S YOU ALL ABOUT IT IT'S- IN OUR OUR WITNESS ABOUT IT. THEY DO NOT WANT THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR OR THE LOW POLICE TO AND INVESTIGATION THEY THEY WANT THIS THIRD PARTY. INDEPENDENT PIECE AND SO. IT IS OKAY AND CAN RARE CASES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN THE REQUEST IT'S COME UP AND IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL. BUT IT'S THE- EXCEPTION NOT THE NORM. AND UNFORTUNATELY- THE DEBT TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE ROOM ROUTINELY SAYS SAYS NOTE THESE REQUESTS AND SO. OUR PROCESS WOULD SET UP AND SAY IF. THAT SHOULD SHERIFF OF ORANGE COUNTY NEAR POLICE CHIEF OF. NORTH LOCAL THERE. ASKED THIS INDEPENDENT. THE STATE PROSECUTOR. COULD NOT SAY NOW. HELLO I HAD TO PLAY OF SETTING UP AN OFF HAVE BEEN REVIEW WHEN I WAS COUNTIES WHO. TO DO WITH OUR SHARE YOUR WORK ON. A ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE INNOCENT VEIN IN SO EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT IT'S INTERESTING TERROR. WAS SORT OF IN A ACT CAME OUT OF THE L. A. BY MIKE G. AND SHOULD NOT GO. A SO ARE CURIOUS AT I DIDN'T HAVE A TOWARD THE SEE IT ALTHOUGH CENTER RITUALS OF PROMOTE WITH THE VETERAN TO BUY WHAT IS THIS MODEL CANAL THAT JUST A WEEK AGO. IT GOOD COULD YOU JUST HELP ME AND MAYBE EVER ANYBODY THAT'S WHY. THAT HAS HEARD OF THE MODEL A YOU WHAT THE IS I DON'T KNOW BY THE DETAIL OF THAT YOU. CANAL ONE BAD KNOW THAT THEIR FIVE STATE. AND THE PER. IS VERY CLEAR I. THEY TAKE ALL. OF THE CAL OF THE DEADLY FOR INTO. IN THOSE STATES AND SOME OF THE R. SUM. CONNECTICUT BY THE SIDE OF LA IN ORANGE COMBINED. WISCONSIN STEP THREE POINT FIVE MILLION. TO THE LARGER OURS BUT ILLINOIS IN THE- AND IT HOW THE AS WELL AS WELL AS THE- AND SO. IT MODELS BUT THE PREMISE. IS IT'S THAT THE LAW THIS ATTORNEY HAS JUST AT TIME. BEING CREDIBLE WITH INVESTIGATION BECAUSE HOW THEY IN FOR A- THEY GET THE AWAY IN DORTMUND THIS. ENDORSED BY. THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE INVESTIGATE SOMEONE THAT THEY KNEW AND WITH THEIR- THEM. IN THE CASE. SO IT JUST BREED. DISTRUST AND SO I THAT'S WHY SEEN. UP PROCESS. ACROSS THE NAY SO YOU KNOW. THIS ONE. THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO GO DOING THAT. THREE FIVE CAN IT BE. DIFFERENT WHAT. IN EVERY SO AN ATTORNEY HAS THE TO INVEST ALONG FOR H. HOWEVER THERE ARE SO STATES THAT'S- THAT. TYPE INCIDENTS TYPES OF SHOOTING WILL BE IN. THE VERY IN IN SOME STAY IT IS THE ATTORNEY. AND OTHERS IT IS A SEPARATELY ENTITY AND THE CONNECTICUT LAW THAT JUST PASSED. WAS THEY GAVE THAT AUTHORITY. TO EIGHT TO BE ESTABLISHED SEPARATE PROSECUTING ANTI NOT TO THEIR ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE WAS ONLY JUST PASSED SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. WHETHER IT BUILDS TRUST YOUR IS FAIR OR INDEPENDENCE BUT BUILT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THEIR HI CAN'T RECALL RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER STATES THAT DO HAVE. ENTITIES ALREADY THAT ARE NOT HERE TURNING GENERAL'S BUT I DON'T HAVE DATA ON DOES. I'LL DO A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH MY LAST QUESTION MANAGERS JUST COSTS ARE YOU TO MAKE YOUR CASE TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WELL THIS IS PURSUANT TO BEING FUNDED IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET WE'RE WE'RE ENGAGING WITH THE GOVERNOR HE'S EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT HE LIKES THE NOTION OF HAVING INDEPENDENT DESTINATIONS FOR DEADLY FORCE INCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THESE FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN DOING. YOU WERE WE'RE SORTING THAT OUT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND GREAT DEBATE TODAY AND YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL. YOU KNOW WORKING OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AYE AYE AYE REALLY ADMIT BUT WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS A OF PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA. NOTE IF IT'S IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THEY HAVE A BIG BUDGET OF A BILLION DOLLARS PLUS- YOU KNOW IF POTENTIALLY THIS COULD BE MORE. READY WITHIN THOSE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THERE. OR THAT THIS COULD BE A PRIORITY FOR OUR OUR DECK OUR BUDGET PROCESS NEXT YEAR AND I KNOW WE HAVE. LIMITATIONS WITHIN THEIR THAT COVER NINETEEN REALITY- BUT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ENGAGING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL. SENATE MITCHELL JUST SAID THANKS SORRY ABOUT YOUR- CENTER. I THINK YOU BETTER CHAIR AHEAD YOU CAN MAKE IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE DONT KNOW PLEASE IF YOU ARE A GOING ON NOTHING I IS ON HIS THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL. AND I WANT TO SEE HOW BIRTHDAY TO THE QUEUE. THANK YOU DID. THE YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON THE COST HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE- BUT BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT THE AMENDMENTS- EXPAND QUITE FRANKLY. THE SCULPINS FIGURE OF THE RICH ORIGINAL COMMITTEE UP OVER AND REGIONAL BE ALSO I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE NEW LANGUAGE IN MY EFFORT TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH IT AND KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT. TO HAVE HEARD THE OPPOSITION I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOU. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE- EIGHT EIGHT BILL HOPEFULLY TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- IN PROCESS AND UNDER CONSIDERATION- BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS ABLE TO JUST SHARE KIND OF MY PERSPECTIVE IN. AN AND HOPING THAT WE DON'T SET OURSELVES UP FOR. A PROLONGED. PROCESS AND ALSO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T FULLY CONTROL IF WE'RE NOT CLEAR ABOUT THE WHO AND THE WHAT AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW CONTENT UPON A- BUDGET PRICE PROCESS THAT THAT TAKES. US OUT OF THE FINAL ANALYSIS TO SOME DEGREE IN ALL FAIRNESS- SIZE ONE TO MAKE SURE I SAID THAT BUT I'M ON THE BILL AT THIS POINT- AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BE PLUGGED IN TO. THE CHANGES AS THEY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. JUST ONE FOR. THE REJECTION YEAH I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TOO BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO THIS DISCUSSION ALONG BUT I'D SAY THIS THIS BILL AND THE WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THE- WE'RE TWO WEEKS FROM THE END OF SESSION AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTO. A IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- I WOULD HAVE TO BEG TO DIFFER WITH SOME OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WHO HAVE- SPOKEN UP HERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT THE PROPOSED SOLUTION BETTER OFFER SOMETHING YOURSELVES- THE BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS AT LEAST THE PERCEPTION IF NOT A REALITY THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND THAT THEY'RE NOT PROPERLY INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESSED AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. NOT QUITE SURE I'M TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING AND I'M WILL REFLECT ON THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE THESE AMENDMENTS OBVIOUSLY MORE CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE'S IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION FROM HOPE TO WE GET THAT CLARITY BEFORE THE BILL COMES BEFORE US UP THE FLOOR. BUT IF IT DOES AND I'M A PRE YOUR EFFORTS BOB AGAIN LIKE TO INVITE. OTHER WHO OPPOSE THIS NOTION OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS- HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE FRANKLY DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT TO- MONITOR AND TO REGULATE THEIR OWN AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME. LEGITIMATE REASON WHY- BUT TO AND THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOES TRY TO MOVE THAT BALL FORWARD INTO A MORE INDEPENDENT- ENTITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ITS- OWN INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME. BUT WE DID THIS PREVIOUSLY- IN THE AREA OF- OUR SHERIFFS WERE ALSO THE- CORNERS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. AND THE REALITIES OF THE PUBLIC'S PERSPECTIVE. M. HEALTH TO UP. IN TRYING TO LEAVE A- OF THOSE ALLEGED CONCERNS. I WILL SEND BUT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE MOMENT SO THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MANAGER I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS EFFORT THIS IS HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU INTRODUCED THE VERSIONS BELASYSE A THIRD THIRD TIME. SO EVEN THOUGH- YOU KNOW HE'S IMPORTANCE AS TERMS OF CONTACTS YES THIS IS AN ABBREVIATED SESSION. READING CHALLENGES WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BILLS ON WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND SO I KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND YOU KNOW PRESUMABLY. NEXT WEEK POLLS DO MORE WORK ON THIS AND SINCE IT HAS TO BE FUNDED ANYWAY. YOU KNOW THERE CAN ALSO BE YOU KNOW CLEANUP'S NEXT YEAR AS WELL. BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW. IDEA OF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN RAISING THIS ISSUE THE BILL'S GONNA BE TOTALLY FOR A DIET OR WHAT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL. I'M SORRY COMMEND YOU FOR KEEPING AT AT. AND I SINGLE SPECIALLY NOW THIS YEAR IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE A STRONG STATEMENT. ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE IN THESE- INVESTIGATIONS. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AN- PACKAGE EVERY INTO. FOR FIVE DAYS. INVESTIGATIONS TO BE INDEPENDENT AND TO BE PERCEIVED. AS INDEPENDENT. I INCLUDING THE OFFICERS BECAUSE OF AN OFFICER- FOR DECISIONS MAY NOT TO CHARGE TO EXONERATE THE OFFICER. IT'S GONNA YOU KNOW HAVING THE COMMUNITY HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IT WAS A REAL INVESTIGATION INDEPENDENT- INVESTIGATION THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILY AND THE SURVIVORS IMPORTANT FOR. THE OFFICER WHO IS INVOLVED IT'S IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST. FOR THERE TO BE UNIVERSAL CONFIDENCE OF THIS THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING DONE INDEPENDENTLY AND WELL. I NOTICED SOME MORE WORK TO DO AND FRANKLY PARKING TO BE MORE WORK TO DO NEXT YEAR-BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE A STATEMENT I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIRTY THREE FOUR FIVE S. FOR YOUR CLOTHES LET ME JUST. ADD WHAT I HOPE IS SOME CLARIFICATIONS SOUGHT. D. THE BILL. IF IT IS SIGNED INTO LAW DOES IMMEDIATELY GOING TO AFFECT THE END BECAUSE WE HAVE A STATE PROSECUTOR AND THAT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO IT DOES IMMEDIATELY GOING TO AFFECT. THE DIFFERENCE THE THING THAT THE BILL FUNDAMENTALLY DOES THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE STATUS QUO THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW. OUR STATE PROSECUTOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE ANY SHOOTING. AND RIGHT NOW IT JURISDICTION CAN ASK THEM TO AS WE HAVE OBSERVED THEY HAPPEN. IN SOME CASES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SAID NO. AND I'M NOT REFERRING LET ME BACK UP I'M NOT TRYING TO PERSONALIZE THIS TO A CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL IF WE LOOK T ALL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FOR THE LAST AT LEAST MYERS RATIONS TWENTY YEARS. THEY HAVE. THOSE OFFICES HAVE NOT WANTED TO BE INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATING SUCH SHOOTINGS. THEY HAVE TENDED NOT TO. WHERE THEY HAVE. AND TEY'VE TENDED NOT TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO WHEN THEY ARE ASKED. SO THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE AT THIS BILL DOES IS REQUIRES INVESTIGATIONS. FOR ALL OF THOSE DEATHS THAT ARE UNARMED PEOPLE. AND THEN ALLOWS REQUIRES INVESTIGATION NOT JUST ALLOWS REQUIRES INVESTIGATIONS IF THE D. A. THE SHERIFF OR THE GOVERNING BODY ASKS THE DA THE SHERIFF STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FOR THE GOVERNING BODY SO NOT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASKS SO THOSE ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICY DIFFERENCES THAT THIS BILL MAKES. AND THOSE IF WERE TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. WHERE OBVIOUSLY A BUDGET QUICK COMES INTO PLAY IS IF. THERE IS. D. DESIRE TO ESTABLISH WELL FIRST. IF THE OFFICE IF THE AG'S OFFICE OBVIOUSLY WILL COME BACK IN EDUCATE. THEY WILL NEED X. AMOUNT OF STAFF IN UP TO APPROPRIATELY IMPLEMENT THE BILL'S AS DESIGNED OR IF THERE IS THE DESIRE TO ESTABLISH A INDEPENDENT OFFICE. SEPARATE FROM THE AG'S AND THE IF THE BILL WERE DESIGNED TO FROM DAY ONE SET UP AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE THAT WOULD TAKE TIME AND THEN THERE WOULD BE OTHER PROVISIONS IN EFFECT WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO ESTABLISH THAT INDEPENDENT DID YOU STARK SO AT LEAST IF THERE IS THE CHOICE TO SET UP THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY THERE'S AT LEAST PROVISION FOR INVESTIGATIONS IN THE INTERIM IF THERE ARE SUCH SHOOTINGS IN THAT IMPROVE. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR VACATION SINGLE LITTLE CONFUSION THAT WHEN A BILL GOES WHEN A BILL BECOMES LAW IF IN THE CASE IT DOES IT ISN'T AFFECTING EVEN THOUGH IN THE- NOT BEEN. YET MATE CENTER SO DO YOU WANT HAS BUDGET YOU'RE A FEW FIVE THERE'S A CLEAR IF THERE'S A TICKET WAS IN THEIR OWN NOT A OKAY HE HE. YEAH ABOUT THAT BUT BUT IN IN YOUR- BEAR IN IN IN IN IN IN THAT. IN YOUR MIND MADAM. WHO WOULD THEN MAKE THE DECISION IF AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY WHAT WERE TO BE SET UP THAT THAT'S WHERE I'M NOT CLEAR IF THAT'S THAT'S MY POINT ABOUT- I DON'T WEEK IN RIGHT THE BODY OF LAW WE PASS MAKE THE DECLARE TAKE THAT THE ORIGINAL BILL. REFERENCE THE BOMB ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL YES SO IN YOUR MIND THE SCENARIO YOU JUST PAY FOR US WHO WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION. SO D. R. INTO- THE- I DON'T MEAN TO BE TO A- I GUESS I WOULD POSE IT IS THAT. THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A STATUTE CHANGE. FOR SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT SO IF FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE ENTITY THAT. TWENTY FIVE THAT MMHM THEN AT LEAST WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE ITS STATUTE BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD HAVE TO. YES OKAY THIRD SAYS THAT HELP. OKAY. SENATOR MOORLACH HAS BEEN A CLARIFICATION AND I'M SURE YOU SAID IT COMES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND WELL WHEN AT. THE NORMAL TIME OF IF THE BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW IT WOULD BE JANUARY FIRST THANK YOU MEASURES CELL. BUSINESS AND ANYTHING LOWER TAKE A LOOK BACK YEAH. OKAY PART OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY ME CLOSE YES THANK YOU I THINK A LOT OF YOU HELP ME CLOSE IN YOUR IN YOUR FINAL COMMENTS- TRIED TO PRE BRIEF IN MY CLASS. THERE HAVE FLOYD WAS LAST YEAR MY CAN. IT'S BEEN A GREAT CRY FOR COMMONSENSE POLICE REFORM AND SOME TIMES REALLY AGGRESSIVE POLICE REFORM THIS ONE I THINK IS WHAT SETS IS IT'S REALLY NOT THAT COMPLICATED THAT'S WHY YOU SEE. FOR SUPPLY. PEACEABLE TALKING IF YOU LOOK AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE TALKING IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION A LOT OF COMMENTS TODAY RIGHT AND THEY DID THAT THAT THAT CONCLUSION IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS JUST DISTRUST THE LOCAL LEVEL AND- WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO MAKE. THANK DONE THAT THE NOTION THAT. THE SENDER JACKSON'S IS TRUE NOBODY TRUSTS WHEN POLICE POLICE THE- IS COME SENSE AND SO BRING IN ABOUT. A DEFINED APPROACH FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ARTS LEADS STATE PROSECUTOR WHETHER IT'S- TURNING GENERAL OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO HAVE A HAVE A ROLE IN THAT IS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN CALIFORNIA TO BRING ABOUT MORE PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR POLICING IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
