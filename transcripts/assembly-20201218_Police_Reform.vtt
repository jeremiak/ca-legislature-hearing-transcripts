WHEN THE DECISION ARE MADE IT

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:42.772
IS IMPORTANT THAT THE

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:46.042
SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE.

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.677
WHEN I BELIEVE COMES THE NEED

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.812

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:55.104
PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND IN THIS

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.406
COUNTRY. I WILL SAY THAT WE

01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:02.445
HAVE. RIGHT NOW- BEYOND JUST A

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.814
MOMENT IN TIME AN ENTIRE

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.649
MOVEMENT ADDRESSING THESE

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:09.051
ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:10.353
THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:12.922
WE SEE SO MUCH CIVIL UNREST

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.357
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:18.227
DIRECTLY. I WILL SAY- I'M

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.197
HOPEFUL THAT SOLUTIONS ARE IN

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.366
THE FUTURE. AND I THINK WE HAVE

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:24.767
SOME GUIDELINES ALREADY THAT

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.869
EXIST- ONE OF THE BIGGEST I

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:29.071
THINK THAT EXIST IS. THAT THE

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:32.408
ISSUED. THEY ISSUED RULES FROM

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.342
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.077
THAT WE'VE HAD FOR A NUMBER OF

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.512
YEARS THAT CAME OUT UNDER THE

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.981
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT PART

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:41.317
OF THE PROBLEM- WITH THE TWENTY

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.452
FIRST CENTURY CENTURY POLICING

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.088
IS THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.057
ENCOURAGED AND NOT MANDATORY.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.458
AND THEY ARE INTERPRETED

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.627
DIFFERENTLY JURISDICTION TO

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.862
JURISDICTION AND THAT GOES

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.463
BEYOND JUST LOCAL IT GOES TO

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.199
STATE AS WELL AND CERTAINLY AT

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.201
THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE HAD

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.936
SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN TERMS

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:03.372
OF HOW THOSE POLICIES SHOULD BE

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:06.175
MANDATED AND ENFORCED- TO HAVE

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.210
HIGHER ACCOUNTABILITY

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:09.512
SPECIFICALLY. FOR COMMUNITIES

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.980
OF COLOR AND DISENFRANCHISED

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.748
COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S PART

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:15.151
OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND LIKE

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.353
I SAID I YOU KNOW SOMETIMES.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.487
PEOPLE CHALLENGE ME ON MY

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.590
OPINIONS AND THAT'S FINE BUT

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.758
YOU DON'T GET TO CHALLENGE ME

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.393
ON FACTS AND YOU DON'T GET THE

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.762
CHALLENGE ON STATISTICS THAT WE

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.699
KNOW THAT OUR ABSOLUTE. THAT

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:32.335
CONFIRM REYES DISPARITIES AND

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.469
POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.806
NOW THESE ARE JUST FACTS- AND I

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.941
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.577
GENERALLY BECAUSE- IT'S HARD

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:42.845
WHEN FOLKS AREN'T ON THE SAME

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:45.181
PAGE AND ARE CHALLENGED WITH

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:47.149
OUT A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.317
THAT RACE DISPARITIES ARE

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.520
ACTUALLY EXISTING AND MOST IF

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.689
NOT ALL JURISDICTIONS. AND TO

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.258
THE DEGREE THAT'S AN ISSUE I

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:56.726
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.728
THEIR USE OF FOR STATISTICS AND

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:01.297
OVERLAY THEM WITH RACE ANALYSIS

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.432
AND YOU'LL SEE- AND HAVE IT

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:06.702
CONFIRMED. THAT OVER 19% OF USE

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.772
OF FORCE RECORDS ARE HIGHER FOR

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.974
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE AGAIN

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.610
THESE ARE JUST FACTS- AFRICAN

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:16.979
AMERICAN MAN SPECIFICALLY ARE

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:19.448
TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:23.019
BE. KILLED WITH INTERACTIONS.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.787
WITH LAW COURSE AGAIN FEES ARE

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.589
JUST FACTS BUT THEY GIVE US THE

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.424
GROUNDWORK AND A FRAMEWORK TO

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:29.759
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:31.193
DISPARITIES AND NOW WHAT CAN WE

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.429
DO TO SOLVENTS AT TO SOLVE

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:36.332
THEM. HOW DO WE REBUILD PUBLIC

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:39.168
TRUST AND HOW DO WE HAVE ACTUAL

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:41.137
POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. AGAIN WE

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:43.406
ALREADY KNOW NOT ALL COPS ARE

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.908
BAD BUT THE INSTITUTION OF

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.277
POLICING HAS TO CHANGE TO BE

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.880
RACE NEUTRAL. WE ARE PAYING OUR

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:54.450
TAX DOLLARS WE ARE ENTITLED TO

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:55.384
PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.986
COMMUNITIES THAT IS RACE

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.154
NEUTRAL AND THAT DOES NOT

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.891
INCLUDE. RACE DISPARITIES- THE

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:04.193
BEST PRACTICES AS DEFINED BY

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.294
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.763
OUR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.132
WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:12.234
AGENCY EVALUATING LAW

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.537
ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES WE'VE GOT

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.272
OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LAW

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:17.873
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THIS

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.810
COUNTRY. AND JUST OVER TWO

01:06:20.876 --> 01:06:22.244
HUNDRED CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.914
AGENCIES AND I AM THE HEAD OF

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.682
ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES. HERE IN

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.851
CALIFORNIA BUT THAT MEANS THAT

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.886
MY INFORMATION IS EVIDENCE

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:33.122
BASED IT IS BASED ON THE

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.290
TRANSGRESSIONS AND THE

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.624
COMPLAINTS THAT COME INTO MY

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.927
OFFICE THAT I SEE. BEYOND JUST

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.295
WHAT MY OWN PERSONAL

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.263
EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN GROWING

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.632
UP IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.502
STATE- AS WELL. SO KNOWING THAT

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:49.372
INFORMATION I WOULD SAY. THAT

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.639
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:53.609
TO DEAL WITH- AS A PRIORITY IS

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.011
ADDRESSING PUBLIC TRUST AND WHY

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:57.747
IT'S BROKEN AND WHAT SOME OF

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.949
THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE AND I WOULD

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.450
SAY SOME OF THE LOW HANGING

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.818
FRUIT OR SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.687
THAT. WE SHOULD START WITH OUR

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.522
WE COULD START WITH ARE MAKING

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.924
SURE THAT POLICE AND LAW

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:11.193
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.162
JUST INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:14.597
THAT HAS NOT PROVEN TO BE

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.632
RELIABLE AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.300
PROVEN TO SPEAK TO THE LACK OF

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.069
PUBLIC TRUST ABOUT WHAT THE

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.570
PROCESSES ARE THAT WE'VE

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.439
DEVELOPED AS LEADERS AND AS

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:26.242
LEGISLATORS. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.377
SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. ARE

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.813
SIMILAR FOR THE PUBLIC AS THEY

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.948
ARE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:33.749
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:36.218
ACCOUNTABLE IN THE SAME WAYS.

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.053
AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.089
THINK WE CAN START DEALING WITH

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:43.192
IS THAT SINGULAR ISSUE WHERE WE

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.261
DON'T HAVE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT.

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:48.297
WHERE INDEPENDENT JURISDICTIONS

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.266
ARE FORCED TO RELY ON LAW

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:51.400
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.335
INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES THAT

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:56.005
IS NOT PROVEN RELIABLE NOR HAS

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.908
IT PROVEN. NOR HAS IT BEEN

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:00.376
PROVEN TO BE A TOOL THAT

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.544
COMMUNITIES ARE COMFORTABLE

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.580
RELYING ON- AND I WOULD TAKE

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:05.981
THAT A STEP FURTHER THAT

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.384
JUSTICE INDEPENDENTLY SHOULD

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:11.153
NOT REST ENTIRELY ON THOSE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.290
LOCAL PROSECUTORS TO EVALUATE

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.292
EVIDENCE OR INVESTIGATIONS FROM

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.627
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:19.328
THAT THEY WORK WITH ON A

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.430
REGULAR BASIS. THERE SHOULD BE

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.532
STANDARDS WHERE DOES

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.134
INTERACTION SPECIFICALLY WHEN

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:27.970
THEY INVOLVED LETHAL FORCE WERE

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:31.240
OUTSIDE AGENCIES ARE EVALUATING

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.509
WHAT THOSE INCIDENTS ARE THAT

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:35.377
SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO WHAT THE

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.147
PUBLIC CAN RELY UPON AND TRUST

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.549
AS OBJECTIVE. OBJECTIVE

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.985
EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:45.020
WHAT'S GOING ON I MEAN THIS ALL

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.489
SPEAKS OF THINGS I'M GOING TO

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.123
CLOSE OUT WITH IN TERMS OF

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.959
TRANSPARENCY AND DATA BUT

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:51.660
THAT'S THE FOUNDATION OF IT I

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:52.495
THINK WE HAVE A REAL

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.497
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME OF

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:56.532
THE SOLUTIONS NOW. AND AGAIN

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:59.401
THIS IS NOT JUST- MOMENT THAT

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.470
WE'RE HAVING THIS IS AN ENTIRE

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.038
NEW MOVEMENT AND WE'VE BEEN

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:05.107
ADDRESSING RACE DISPARITIES IN

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.475
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR DECADES

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.844
NOW BUT NOW I THINK WE'RE AT A

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.646
TIME WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.147
INFORMED AND HAVE SPECIFIC

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.883
DEMANDS. ON WHAT LAW

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:16.519
ENFORCEMENT MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:18.654
FOR THEM WHAT OUR EADERS ARE

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.189
ACCOUNTABLE FOR IN TERMS OF

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.057
STRUCTURING SOLUTIONS THAT

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:24.493
PEOPLE CAN RELY ON YOU CANNOT

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.295
HAVE PUBLIC TRUST WITH

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:28.898
INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED.

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.634
WHICH GETS ME TO THE DATA POINT

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.135
THAT THE PART THAT THINGS ARE

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.036
DISCUSSED IN TWENTY FIRST

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.604
CENTURY POLICING IN TERMS OF

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.007
DATA WHERE THE DATA SHARING IS

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.909
ENCOURAGED THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.344
MANDATED WE SHOULD HAVE RULES

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:45.180
DEFINING DATA COLLECTION. DATA

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.549
TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS THE

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:47.950
MOST IMPORTANT PART THE DATA

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.719
AND ANALYSIS IT IS NOT ENOUGH

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.054
FOR YOU TO JUST COLLECT THE

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.456
DATA AND ISSUE TEN THOUSAND

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.458
PAGES OF CHARTS AND GRAPHS AND

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.928
NUMBERS WITHOUT INFORMATION AND

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.296
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION NEEDS

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:03.232
TO BE. DEFINED WITH RACE THAT

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:05.134
INFORMATION IS SO IMPORTANT FOR

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.002
US TO SOLVE THINGS BECAUSE WE

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:08.971
CAN'T FX WHAT WE DON'T TALK

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.673
ABOUT AND WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.341
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND IF WE'RE

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.243
NOT COLLECTING THE DATA TO MAKE

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:17.713
IT TRANSPARENT AND SHARING IT

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.814
WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITIES. I

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.115
FEEL LIKE WE'RE SPINNING OUR

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.483
WHEELS AND WE'RE NOT SPEAKING

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.351
TO THE PUBLIC TRUST THAT WE

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.019
HAVE TO CULTIVATE. AND THAT WE

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:25.921
HAVE TO DEVELOP. I WOULD SAY IN

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.190
TERMS OF SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.125
WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL ALREADY

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.860
IN THIS STATE LIKE THE NINETY

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:33.295
SIX A. REPORTS IN THE FOURTEEN

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.063
TWENTY ONE REPORT. THEY'RE

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.397
STILL BEST PRACTICES THAT NEED

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.299
TO BE SHARED IT SHOULDN'T BE

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.134
THAT IT'S A CATCH AS CATCH CAN

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.102
BUY JURISDICTION TO

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.437
JURISDICTION WHO'S DOING IT

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.173
WELL. AND WHO HAS RELIABLE

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.241
INFORMATION THAT'S BOTH SHARED.

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.310
MAY TRANSPARENT AND ANALYZED

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.878
THERE SHOULD BE STANDARDS THAT

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.647
WHERE EVER YOU GO SPECIFICALLY

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.415
IN THE STATE. BUT THAT'S TAKING

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.317
PLACE BECAUSE IF WE BUILD IT

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.386
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:58.887
STATES WILL FOLLOW BECAUSE I

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.456
BELIEVE ALL COMMUNITIES ARE

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:01.824
DEMANDING THAT ESPECIALLY

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.626
DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES.

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.094
THAT ARE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.862
THE RACE DESPERATE OUTCOMES

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.530
THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR WITH

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.399
THEIR TAX DOLLARS. THIS IS OUR

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.534
OPPORTUNITY IS SIGNED AND THIS

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:13.202
IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.137
THOSE SOLUTIONS. MEASURES

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.439
ANDERSON ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:19.408
ALL OKAY. THE OTHER TWO

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.676
IMPORTANT THINGS I THINK WE

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.512
NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR POLICIES

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.080
POLICIES HAVE TO BE EVIDENCE

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:26.882
BASED POLICIES. DIRECTED

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.083
TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT SO

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.652
THEY'RE NOT BE A RADICAL

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:31.186
SOLUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.621
REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:33.822
DEFINED BY THE DATA THAT WE'VE

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.424
COLLECTED. AND THEN THE LAST

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.692
THING THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.193
IS MAKING SURE THAT ONCE WE'VE

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.195
COME UP WITH THOSE- POLICY

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.330
SUGGESTIONS THAT IT'S

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.499
ABSOLUTELY TIED TO TRAINING WE

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:44.967
HAVE TO REFORM AND ADDRESS

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.769
TRADING WE HAVE TO REFORM AND

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:48.504
ADDRESS BIAS AND THE ONLY WAY

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:50.239
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. I

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:53.008
BELIEVE IS BY HAVING. NEW AND

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.343
BROADER MEASURES OF

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.979
INDEPENDENCE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.481
ENFORCEMENT CYCLES TO EVALUATE

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.883
AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.651
MANDATES AND POLICIES FOR THOSE

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.086
SAME AGENCIES TO MAKE THEM MORE

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.188
COUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.423

PARTNERSHIP. ALSO KNOWN AS LEAP

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.176
LEAP IS A NONPROFIT GROUP A

PULL BASED PROSECUTORS JUDGES

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:37.980
AND OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.748
PROFESSIONALS WHO SPEAK FROM

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:41.817
&lt;c.cyan&gt;IRST HAND EXPERIENCE. OUR&lt;/c&gt;

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:42.918
MISSION IS TO MAKE COMMUNITIES

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.586
SAFER BY FOCUSING LAW

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:46.188
ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ON THE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.956
GREATEST THREATS TO. PUBLIC

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:50.259
SAFETY PROMOTING ALTERNATIVES

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:52.594
TO ARREST NEW CAR SERRATION

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:53.462
ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:58.133
CRIME. AND BRIDGING THE GAP AND

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:58.667
KILLING A POLICE COMMUNITY

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.335
RELATIONS. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.370
IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.272
AMERICANS STATE THAT POLICING

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.473
NEEDS MAJOR CHANGES AND THEY

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.276
SUPPORT WIDESPREAD REFORMS.

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:08.510
WHICH INCLUDE CHANGING

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:11.380
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO OFFICER

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.882
ABUSES ARE PUNISHED. BUT I WANT

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.417
TO NOTE THAT AMERICANS ACROSS

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:17.386
THE COUNTRY ALSO SUPPORT LAW

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:20.088
ENFORCEMENT BUT WHAT THE DEMAND

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.024
IS PROFESSIONAL AND GOOD

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.860
POLICING. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.728
THAT I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER WAS

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.630
TO LOOK AT THIS VERY COMPLEX

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:31.166
AND LAYERED CONVERSATION AND TO

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:33.535
SEE YOU KNOW. ARE THERE HURDLES

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.903
ENOUGH HOLDING OFF SERVICE

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.238
RIGHTS WHILE SEEKING TO HOLD

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.940
THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISCONDUCT

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:40.542
AND- WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IT IS

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.444
I FULLY SUPPORT AND UNDERSTAND

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.545
THE NEED FOR ENSURING THAT

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.880
POLICE OFFICER PROCEDURAL

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:47.115
RIGHTS ARE UPHELD. AND I'VE

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.250
ALWAYS SUPPORTED PEACE PROCESS

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.153
SAYS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.121
TO TALK IN DEPTH ABOUT THE

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:55.157
ARBITRATION AND THE APPEALS

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.860
PROCESS BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:59.228
THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.996
RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE THAT

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:04.132
SPEAKS TO THE INTERSECTION OF

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.868
HOW POLICE MEMORANDUMS THE

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.636
POLICE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.137
AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:11.440
AGREEMENTS CAN'T CONTRIBUTE

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.442
BOTH TO THE PERCEPTION THAT

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:14.443
OFFICERS ARE BEING HELD

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:17.279
ACCOUNTABLE FOR CREATE BARRIERS

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.714
FOR OFFICERS BEING HELD

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.316
ACCOUNTABLE SO FOR A FUTURE

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:24.052
DISCUSSION A TOPIC I THINK THAT

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.587
THERE ARE PLACES THAT WE CAN.

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.356
POTENTIALLY AGREED THAT THERE

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:28.824
NEEDS TO BE SOME TWEAKING OF

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.959
THESE SYSTEMS. BUT THE LARGER

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.629
QUESTION IS HOW WE IMPROVE A

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.898
SYSTEM OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:37.699
AND WHAT PROCESS AND POLICIES

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:39.401
CAN HELP US BETTER SERVE OUR

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.236
COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:45.240
PROCEDURAL JUSTICE. IN THIS

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:49.678
DISCIPLINE PROCESS. SO. BUT

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.813
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SPEAK TO

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.415
IS AS WE LOOK AT THIS

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:54.883
DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND AS WE

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.084
LOOK AT THIS LICENSE IN A

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:58.387
REPLICATION PROCESS THAT THERE

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.056
ARE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:01.790
HAVE LOOKED AT THEIR

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:04.426
ARBITRATION PROCESS IN SO

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.328
FOURTEEN AS AN EXAMPLE BARS AN

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.263
ARBITRATOR FROM OVERRULING OR

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.598
MODIFYING PUNISHMENT HANDED

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:10.899
DOWN AGAINST AN OFFICER UNLESS

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:13.068
ARBITRATOR FINDS THE PUNISHMENT

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:15.537
TO BE ARBITRARY CAPRICIOUS

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.439
DISCRIMINATORY OR OTHERWISE.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.075
UNREASONABLE AND IT'S THIS TYPE

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.977
OF LANGUAGE THAT PROTECTS BOTH

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:23.946
THE OFFICER AND THE COMMUNITY

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.314
BUT WHAT IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.283
CALIFORNIA'S ALSO LACK OF THE

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.751
DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. POLICE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.586
DECERTIFICATION IS AN INTUITIVE

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.522
AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.290
ESCALATING POLICE COMMUNITY

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.192
RELATION CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.261
PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AS

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.395
WELL AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:42.698
NOTED WERE PREDICTABLE RESPONSE

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.733
HER ABJECT FAILURE TO ADDRESS

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.268
SPECIFIC TRANSPARENCY AND

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.870
ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS WITHIN

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:49.571
THE PROFESSION OF LAW

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.340
ENFORCEMENT. I WOULD ALSO

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.942
SUGGEST THAT THE CERTIFICATION

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.278
SHOULD BE THE LAST PROCESS IN

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.213
THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONALISM

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.449
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.684
THAT INCLUDES THE ENGAGEMENT.

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.720
OF ALL COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.688
NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.557
SYSTEMIC APPROACHES TO ENSURE

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:09.925
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PREVENT

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:12.127
MISCONDUCT MUST INCLUDE CLEAR

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.262
POLICIES TRAINING AFFECTED

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.958
THEY THINK THE SECOND QUESTION

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:12.827
DO THEY THINK THAT THERE. ARE

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:15.330
OFFICERS THAT SLIP THROUGH THE

AN INVESTIGATION IS FINALIZED.

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:27.876
MAYBE THERE ISN'T A CRIMINAL

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.511

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.613
OPPORTUNITY TO FOR PEOPLE TO-

ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ARE YOU WAS

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.116
ASKING THAT QUESTION I THINK

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:11.186
THERE ARE NO DOUBT THERE ARE

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.687
OFFICERS THAT I HAVE SLIPPED

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:14.756
THROUGH THE CRACKS AND I THINK

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.991
FOR THE VERY REASON THAT HE-

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:20.295
INDICATED WHICH WAS THAT- WELL

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:21.930
ONE OF THE REASONS. IS BECAUSE

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:24.165
THEY HAD NO THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:28.269
OF- POSTED HAVE- YOU KNOW

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:31.439
RESIGNED- BEFORE THE COMPLETION

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.741
OF A AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.843
INVESTIGATION BUT WE CAUGHT OUR

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.911
FIRST NOW THAT'S THE ASIAN. AND

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:39.614
AS A RESULT- THEY AREN'T-

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.516
DISCIPLINE BY THAT AGENCY THAT

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:43.118
WAS- THERE AT WORK FOR

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:46.888
PREVIOUSLY- AND SO THE TRACKING

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.923
OF THAT INFORMATION THEY DO-

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.892
BACKGROUNDS ON OFFICERS TO GO

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.726
TO THOSE POLICE DEPARTMENTS

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.728
BUT- WHEN THEY YOU KNOW WHEN

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:54.396
YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:55.130
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.431
INVESTIGATIONS WHAT WAS THE

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.999
OUTCOME THERE WAS NO OUTCOME

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:00.168
RIGHT BECAUSE- THE

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:02.404
INVESTIGATION WASN'T COMPLETED-

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.072
AND- BECAUSE THEY HAD LEFT-

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.607
PREVIOUS TO IT HAPPENED I'M

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.308
COMING TO COMPLETION SO. I

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:10.311
THINK- THOSE INSTANCES OF THAT

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:13.014
THOUGH NOT- NUMEROUS THEY ARE

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.716
THEY ARE THERE AND THAT'S

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:18.353
REALITY AND- AND THAT'S ONE OF

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.088
THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO- TO

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.856

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.490
WAS THOUGH THERE WAS SOME

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:57.325
LANGUAGE ISSUES THAT WE- I

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.726
PROBLEMS WITHIN SOME OF THE

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:02.096
OTHER ISSUES THAT- THE WEEK-

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.698
THAT MADE IT SO THAT WE COULD

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.633
NOTE- COULDN'T SUPPORT IT. BUT

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.168
WE DO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.737
WE DO SUPPORT- MOVING FORWARD.

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:13.074
WITH THAT- AND HAVING AND HAVE

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.776
I THINK OUR WHO WAS- PRESENT

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:18.112
MARBLE THAT IT'S STATED- THAT-

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.481
HAVING POSED TO THE SINCE THEY

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.316
DO THE CERTIFICATION. OF

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.318
OFFICERS BE THE BODY THAT D.

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.753
CERTIFIES THEM. AND THAT WAS A

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.557
AN IMPORTANT ASPECT. OF THAT

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.993
FOR US- CHEAP NEW YEAR'S WHAT I

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.330

HEAR CORRECTLY WHEN YOU SAID

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:39.100
THAT- THE INVESTIGATION STOPS

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:43.404
IF AN OFFICER- RESIGN. AND YOU

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:44.506
DON'T GO FOR TO CONCLUDE

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.341
WHETHER NOT THAT PERSON WAS

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:49.878
ACTUALLY- COMMITTED TO WHATEVER

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:51.479
THAT PERSON WAS ALLEGED TO

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.581
COMMIT SO THAT JUST STOPS IT IS

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.617
NOT A WAY FOR AN OFFICER TO. IT

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:57.852
TOO- GO TO ANOTHER POLICE

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:58.820
DEPARTMENT SAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:02.390
BEEN PROSECUTOR OR FOUND GUILTY

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.092
OR WHATEVER ALLEGATIONS MAYBE.

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:04.993
AS CHAIR THERE ARE SOME

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:06.427
INVESTIGATIONS WERE SOME

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.263
AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE.

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.532
AND DO THAT BUT FOR IF IN PART

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.633
OF THAT INVESTIGATION IS

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.067
INTERVIEWING THAT OFFICER

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:15.003
GETTING THEIR TESTIMONY. AND

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.404
GETTING THAT AS PART OF THE

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.039
EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE AND YOU

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.241
DON'T HAVE IT IT'S HARD TO COME

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:23.311
TO THE- CONCLUSION- YOU KNOW

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.246
HOW WITH THAT INVESTIGATION.

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:28.216
AND AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS-

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:31.553
REFERENCING. SO THEY CAN PICK

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:34.522
IT IS ACTUALLY YOU HAVE AN

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.089
INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION AT

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:40.295
THAT POINT. OKAY SO ANYONE

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:43.364
COULD USE THAT METHOD TO- TO

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:46.901
EVADE OR TO AVOID BEING OF

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:47.802
FIRED A BLEMISH ON A PERSON'S

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:50.572
RECORD- AND SO DO YOU THINK

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:52.273
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IN

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.244
YOUR OPINION. HE NO I DO NOT

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.111
THINK IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.746
AND THEN THE LATE AS I SAID

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.014
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.984
BAD APPLES IN MOST POLICE

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:03.818
OFFICERS ARE GONNA WANT THAT

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.987
DUE PROCESS. AND BE ABLE TO GO

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.623
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND END UP

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:09.691
FIGHTING FOR THEIR YOU KNOW

THEIR THEIR THEIR GOOD NAME AND-

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.995

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.997
PROPERTY RIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:20.468
THAT BUT- ITS THE- THOSE FEW

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:21.135
BAD APPLES WITHIN OUR

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:23.104
PROFESSION. THAT ARE GONNA

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:25.773
PROBABLY OPT FOR THAT- A

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.910
RESIGNATION AND THEN HOPE TO

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.311
ESCAPE THE COMPLETION OF THAT

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:33.948
INVESTIGATION- SO YEAH I DON'T

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:36.317

THAT'S PART OF THE

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.628
DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. THAT

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:47.962
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT

THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WERE JUST

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:22.830
TALKING ABOUT WITH THE- LACK OF

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.699
DISCIPLINE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:26.467
ISSUE OF THE OFFICERS LEAVING.

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.002
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS AND

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.971
THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS SPEAKING

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:31.472
WESTERN UNION WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.807
WITH THE DIFFERENT. LANES OF

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:33.941
ACCOUNTABILITY I JUST WANT TO

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.276
EXPLAIN AND THEN TALK ABOUT

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.644
WHAT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE.

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.913
SO SAFE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.683
TRANSGRESSION INVOLVING- LETHAL

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:43.818
INCIDENT- AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.453
THERE ALL THESE INDEPENDENT

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.988
TRACKS THAT COME OUT TO DO AN

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:49.257
EVALUATION. SO INTERNAL AFFAIRS

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:50.958
IS LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE FROM

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:54.095
THE DEPARTMENT- THE- DISTRICT

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:54.996
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR THE

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.497
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IS LOOKING

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:59.100
AN EVALUATION- AND IF THERE IS

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.902
AN OUTSIDE LIKE CIVILIAN AGENCY

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:02.403
THAT'S A DIRT TRACK AND THOSE

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.371
ARE THE PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT HE

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:04.472
WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT HAVE

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.340
ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:08.176
THAT SPEAK TO THE OFFICERS

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.877
RIGHT TO HAVE HIS EMPLOYMENT

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:11.546
AND THE JOB. AND ONE OF THE

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:13.648
THINGS SO WHEN HE HE SAID THAT-

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.650
DISCIPLINE CAN CONTINUE. THE

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:17.618
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FROM THE

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.253
PROSECUTOR'S AGENCY CAN

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.190
CONTINUE BUT THE THINGS THAT

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:22.790
ARE BLOCKED OFF ARE FREE. THE

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:25.059
INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:26.427
AND THE OUTSIDE AND WERE

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.229
CIVILIAN AGENCY THAT COULD

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.198
HAVE. DISCIPLINE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:31.799
AS WELL SO THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:33.267
THE SOLUTIONS SEPARATE FROM THE

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:34.535
CERTIFICATION ISSUE THAT

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:36.204
JURISDICTION CAN BE EXPANDED TO

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.573
THOSE AGENCIES. TO CONTINUE

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:41.209
THEIR INVESTIGATION TO CONTINUE

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:43.177
THEIR PROCESS FOR DISCIPLINE.

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.679
INDEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:48.116
THAT THE MEMBERS ARE RETIRED

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:51.052
LEAVE QUIT. REMOVED MOVE AWAY

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.221
OR DO WHATEVER SO THAT THOSE

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:55.256
FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT AND THOSE

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.791
FINDINGS FROM THOSE

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.726
INVESTIGATIONS CAN BE USED.

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.762
EVEN IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:03.197
USED FOR THOSE OFFICERS TO BE

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.499
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FROM AN

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.667
ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE OR

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:07.435
FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:08.970
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.938
QUIT OR THEY RESIGNED. THE

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:14.242
INFORMATION IS OFTENTIMES EVEN

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:15.076
MORRELL AND THOSE INVEST. GET

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:16.210
CONCLUDE AND THAT THOSE

01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:17.779
FINDINGS DO GET A FIRM

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.614
SUSTAINED OR REVEALED SO THAT

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.516
WE CAN USE THOSE DATA POINTS TO

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.351
IMPROVE POLICING. SO THE WE

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:24.852
HAVE THE INFORMATION AND OFTEN

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.321
TIMES IT'S THOSE VERY INCIDENTS

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.123
WHERE WE NEED THAT DATA THE

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.092
MOST. WE NEED THOSE FINDINGS

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:32.593
THE MOST AND I KEEP REFERRING

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.228
TO THESE AS- CONCLUDING THE

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:35.530
INVESTIGATION TO THE POINT OF

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:36.597
HAVING FINDINGS BECAUSE THE

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:38.299
FINDINGS ARE MOST OFTEN WHAT

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.434
GETS REVEALED. THE FINDINGS ARE

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.969
WHAT CAN BECOME TRANSPARENT AND

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:43.104
THE FINDINGS ARE WHAT WE CAN

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:45.206
USE TO CONFLATE OUR DATA TO

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.908
EVALUATE TRENDS AND TO IMPROVE

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:47.975
POLICING AND TO ADDRESS THE

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.610
TRANSGRESSIONS THAT APPLY THAT

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:50.945
TOOK PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.880
UP. AND ALLOWS A LOT I'M MEAN

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.148
THE LECTURE EVERYBODY BUT I

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.950
JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT. SOME

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.118
OF THE THINGS THAT HE'S TALKING

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.152
ABOUT A LOT OF THE POLICING

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.420
STUFF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:01.022
DISCIPLINE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.790
IT'S PRETTY ESOTERIC WILL

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:06.127
MISTER HENDERSON MAYBE I CAN

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:07.094
NOW YES TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:08.362
THERE IS A COUNTER PROPOSALS

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:10.498
TODAY LAST YEAR. THE HOT AND

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.900
HEAVY ON THIS TOPIC. WHY HASN'T

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.702
LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY KNOW

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:17.672
IT'S A PROBLEM. PURSUE THIS AND

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.240
PUSH THIS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.342
SOME BAD APPLES MAKE MISTER

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:22.610
LACKING AND COLLEAGUES LOOK BAD

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:25.246
THE CHP NEVER HURTS. EVERYBODY

THROUGH THE CRACKS WERE SAYING

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.317
THEY DO NOW SO WHY DO YOU THINK

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.318
THAT THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:32.820
PUSH TO DO SO. AND DO YOU THINK

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.222
THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE PLENTY

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:36.691
OF. INDIVIDUALS IN THE EXAMPLES

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.360
WHO. RESIGNED BEFORE AND I A

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:41.262
INVESTIGATION IS A JUDICATA

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:42.763
PERSONAL MATTERS TAKEN CARE OF.

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.799
AND THEN GO ON TO WORK IN. THE

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.033
EXAMPLES LIKE MAKE CITY

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:50.371
MCFARLAND LIKE MR SALAS. THE

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:50.972
SANGER OF ELSEWHERE AROUND THE

TO SEE. DO WE HAVE

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.727
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE BAD

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.729

THAT TRANSGRESSIONS THAT HAVE

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:10.131
TAKEN PLACE THAT ARE KNOWN- AND

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:11.398
THESE TYPES OF TRANSGRESSIONS

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:12.700
ARE KNOWN IN EVERY COMMUNITY

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.135

THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD AND I

01:36:19.306 --> 01:36:21.742
MYSELF HAVE HAD SOME REALLY BAD

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:24.512
EXPERIENCES THOSE ARE REAL AND

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:25.813
THEY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.848
SPECIFICALLY THE ONES THAT DEAL

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:29.583
WITH AND ENCOMPASS RACE WE

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.952
CAN'T BE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:33.754
RACE AS IT RELATES TO POLICING

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:35.589
AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TOPIC AND

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:36.824
IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE TOPIC BUT

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:41.028
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE. TOPIC IF

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:41.562
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK THE

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:42.163
PUBLIC TRY YOU HAVE TO ABOUT

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:43.097
WHERE. YOU MUST ADDRESS THE

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.099
RACE DISPARITIES AND YOU MUST

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:47.101
MAKE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS RACE

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:49.370
DISPARITIES IN POLICING AND LAW

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.472
ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S THAT'S STEP

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:53.007
ONE THE SECONDARY STEP IS

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.775
BEYOND JUST THE DISCUSSION

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.544
THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.878
THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.547
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAS TO

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.448
BE BOTH KNOWN AND MEASURED.

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:02.716
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.051
TO TRUST THE SYSTEM THAT YOU

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.619
CAN'T SEE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.454
BE ABLE TO TRUST A SYSTEM THAT

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:09.557
DOESN'T HAVE RESULTS. WHERE

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.559
THERE ARE LOOPHOLES OR WHERE

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:14.361
THERE IS DISCRETIONARY-

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:16.030
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CHANGES

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.499
FROM. BLOCK TO BLOCK CITY TO

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:20.634
CITY COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND SO

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:23.103
TO THE DEGREE WE HAVE BROAD-

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.139
BROAD MEASURES IN PLACE AND ONE

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:27.641
CITY OR ONE COUNTY. IT'S AN

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.977
UNFAIR EVALUATION TO HAVE THOSE

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:31.745
SAME TRANSGRESSIONS TAKE PLACE

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:33.714
IN THE CITY RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:34.915
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:35.883
SAME SYSTEM I THINK

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:38.419
INSTITUTIONALIZE. THE SOLUTION

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:41.522
IN A WAY. BY WORKING WITH A

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.556
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.891
DEVELOPING SO CIVILIAN

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:45.793
OVERSIGHT AGENCIES BY HAVING

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:48.028
STRONGER LEGISLATION THAT IS

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:50.731
INFORMED BY THE DATA. INFORMED

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:52.900
BY COMPLAINTS AND INFORMED BY

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.702
SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:56.704
TRANSGRESSIONS THAT'S THE WAY

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.239
TO MOVE FORWARD AND THOSE ARE

01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:00.140
SOLUTIONS. THAT YOU CAN BUILD

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.742
OUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL IF THAT

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:03.310
WORK ISN'T BEING DONE ARE THOSE

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.678
CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.080
PLACE. BUT THAT'S ALSO WORK

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:08.182
THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN BE TAKEN AT

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.316
THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AND

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:10.384
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.452
HOPE WE HAVE IN THIS

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:12.686
CONVERSATION SO WE CAN TALK

01:38:12.753 --> 01:38:13.687
ABOUT WHAT THOSE SOLUTIONS CAN

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.122

ACT TO REQUIRE A DEGREE OF

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:50.657
SPECIFIC INTENT THAT MAKES IT

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.225
VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOVER.

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:54.061
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:55.262
THAT THERE IS THE TRADITIONAL

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.730

DANGER SHOULD BE ADVISED. TO

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:30.230
LIMIT STATE LONG UNITIES. IN

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.332
RECENT YEARS COURTS AND IN

01:44:32.399 --> 01:44:35.268
ORDER TO STAY LONG IT IS AN

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:37.104
OFFENCE TO THE BANYAK. THAT'S

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:39.840

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:42.743
DEFENSE THE STATE LAW- UNITIES.

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:45.512
AND SO IN RECENT YEARS THE

EVEN WHEN THEY DELIBERATELY

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.854

MALICIOUS PROSECUTION. AND THIS

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.698
SHOULD BE CHANGED SO THAT THERE

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:07.234

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.404
FINALLY IT SHOULD BE A PLAN

BRILLIANT INSIGHT AND ANALYSIS

AND HOW THE LAW WORKS AND PART

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:37.310
OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALK ABOUT

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:39.145
WHY PUBLIC TRUST IS DIMINISHED

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:41.414
ARE EXACTLY THE ISSUES THAT HE

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:43.182
WAS ADDRESSING IN TERMS OF

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.384
DEFENSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

CHALLENGED ON TRANSGRESSIONS IT

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:03.436
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE HEART

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:06.005
OF WHY PUBLIC TRUST HAS BEEN

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:08.841
ERODED AND IN SPEAKING ABOUT

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:10.543

THE LEGAL FAILED BUT EVEN THIS.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:27.627
INTERPRETATION OF CHALLENGES

01:59:27.693 --> 01:59:30.563
FOR OFFICERS IS A PART OF THE

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:32.698
PUBLIC TRUST BEING ERODED AND

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.033
I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:37.670
HOW IF ANY- AN INDIVIDUAL

01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:39.238

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:42.141
EVALUATED BY A PROSTITUTE REAL

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.710
AGENCY INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN

01:59:44.777 --> 01:59:46.279
OFTEN CASES WE'LL SEE THOSE

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.648
SAME ACTIONS WHEN THEY ARE USED

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:51.117

BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT'S

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:57.557
INDEPENDENT FROM AN AGENCY OR

01:59:57.623 --> 02:00:00.693
AN AGENT ACTING AS A PROSPECT

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:04.530

BEHAVIOR THOUGH THOSE.

02:00:05.097 --> 02:00:06.465
SUBJECTIVE INTRANSIGENT

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.634
DIFFERENCES WHEN WE E. VALUE

02:00:08.701 --> 02:00:11.504
WEIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOR

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:13.773
SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF WHY THE

PUBLIC HAS MISTRUST AND IT HAS

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:17.677

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:19.712
ENFORCEMENT. LOOKS LIKE WHEN

02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:21.314
WE'RE EFINING WHAT

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.516
ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE AND TO

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:24.550
ANSWER THE QUESTION

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:26.018
SPECIFICALLY FROM ASSEMBLY

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.353
MEMBER WEBER THAT SHE POSED IN

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.888
TERMS OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY CAN

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:31.023
DO AND WHAT ROLE THEY PLAY. AND

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.191
I BELIEVE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:33.726
THE MEASURE B. THAT SHE HAD

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:36.128
TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS GOING AND

02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:37.163
I THINK IT'S BETTER BE THIS

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:38.164
YEAR'S REFERENCING FROM SAN

02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:40.566
DIEGO THAT WAS JUST PASSED. THE

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:42.735
ABSOLUTE ROLE SHOULD BE THAT

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:44.770
COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE INFORMED

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:46.405
COMMUNITY CAN START BY GOING TO

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:47.807
THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION AND

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:50.142
ASKING WHAT IS OUR USE OF FORCE

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:52.712
POLICY WHAT ARE OUR STATISTICS

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:54.714
HOW IS THAT COMPARED WITH A

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.048
RACE OVERLAY OF WHAT'S

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:58.417
HAPPENING HERE. SO THEY CAN SEE

02:00:58.484 --> 02:01:00.786
AND LEARN AND KNOW THAT THERE

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.188
ARE DIFFERENT POLICIES FROM

02:01:02.254 --> 02:01:04.357
CITY TO CITY I THINK THE REAL

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:06.626
SOLUTION IS. I THINK SOLUTION

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.761
IS TO PART ONE I THINK WE HAVE

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:11.831
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:14.100
FACING. POLICE REFORMS AND

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:16.569
JUSTICE REFORMS AND A NEW DAY

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.604
GOVERNMENT IS CHANGING AND

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.739
COMMUNITIES ARE CHANGING

02:01:19.805 --> 02:01:21.440
ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:24.110
COMIN OUT OF. HOPEFULLY THE

02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:26.879
THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE ARE LIKELY

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:29.849
TO FACE UNPRECEDENTED-

02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:32.018
FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS- NOT

02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:33.886
JUST IN THE STATE BUT IN

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.955
GENERAL BUT THERE ARE TOOLS

02:01:36.022 --> 02:01:37.823
ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US ALL

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:39.392
AROUND US THAT I THINK CAN BE

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:40.259
BETTER USED AND I'M

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:41.460
SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT IN

02:01:41.527 --> 02:01:43.295
THIS SPEAKS A LITTLE BIT. WHEN

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:44.997
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAW.

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.332
AND THE CIVIL CHALLENGES THAT

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:47.867
WE HAVE THERE ARE ALREADY SOME

02:01:47.933 --> 02:01:49.902
CIVIL CHALLENGES THAT COME

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:52.071
THROUGH OUR CITIES AND STATES

02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:54.006
VERY FREQUENTLY. THAT

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:55.241
INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:57.777
COLLECTED AND ANALYZED AND A

02:01:57.843 --> 02:01:59.278
LOT OF PLACES AND A LOT OF

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:00.446
JURISDICTIONS ARE NECESSARILY

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:02.214
DOING THAT. THE SAME THING FOR

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:04.450
INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS NOT

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:05.951
JUST THE ALLEGATIONS BUT THE

02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:07.253
CONCLUSIONS THAT THEY FOUND

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:09.221
THAT DATA NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:11.457
AND ANALYZED AS WELL. CONFLATED

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:13.192
WITH THE INVEST THE INFORMATION

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:14.760
THAT COMES FROM THE CIVILIAN

02:02:14.827 --> 02:02:15.895
OVERSIGHT AGENCIES THAT DO

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:18.097
EXIST. I'VE SUBMITTED AND IF

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.799
YOU GUYS DIDN'T GET COPIES JUST

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.300
A RECORD OF SOME OF THE RECORDS

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:23.602
THAT MY AGENCY RELEASES EVERY

02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:25.538
YEAR. THROUGH OUR ANNUAL REPORT

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:27.506
ANALYZING EVERY SINGLE

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:29.408
COMPLAINT THAT COMES IN AND

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:31.210
CLASSIFYING IT AS WELL AS THE

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:33.879
SUSTAIN CASES. AND THE CASES

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.748
THAT ARE CHALLENGED WHERE OUR

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.650
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DIFFERENT

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:39.685
FROM WHAT THE DISCIPLINE OR

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:41.554
ACCOUNTABILITY RECORDS ARE. A

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:42.988
LOT OF THESE THINGS ALREADY

02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:43.823
EXIST IN DIFFERENT

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:45.324
JURISDICTIONS WE JUST HAVE TO

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:47.259
MAKE USE OF IT I WILL SAY. THAT

02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:52.164
THAT- THE KEY TO ALL OF THAT IS

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:54.433
WHO MAKES THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.835
AND IS ARE THOSE DECISIONS

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:57.103
BEING MADE IN THIS THAT WORK

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:59.271
BEING MADE. BY AND I THINK THIS

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.040
WAS REFERENCE SEVERAL TIMES BY

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:04.009
AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY AND THAT

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:06.812
SHOULD E. A CIVILIAN AGENCY

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:08.180
OUTSIDE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:10.850
PRACTICES AND IF THAT AGENCY

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.084
DOES NOT EXIST THEY SHOULD BE

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.385
ENCOURAGED TO EXIST IN THOSE

02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:14.854
JURISDICTIONS BUT TO THE DEGREE

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.355
THERE'S A GAP. OR A LACK OF

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:18.157
FUNDING ARE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY

02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:19.058
I THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:20.926
PLAYING A ROLE AND THAT'S ONE

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:22.528
OF THE AREAS THAT I'D LIKE TO

02:03:22.595 --> 02:03:23.729
SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:25.865
OFFICE PLAYING ABOUT- ROLE AND

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:28.434
THAT'S EXPANDED UPON. TO

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:29.835
COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:31.070
SHARE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE

02:03:31.137 --> 02:03:33.806
THAT INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:35.775
SHOULDN'T BE ASPIRATIONAL. AND

02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:36.942
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.944
HAVE PUBLIC TRUST WITHOUT

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:40.813
HAVING INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.581
AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:45.117
AGENCIES HAD I JUST DON'T THINK

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:46.619
THAT THAT'S THE SOLUTION I

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:47.953
THINK THE SOLUTION IS TO

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:49.688
DEVELOP AND CULTIVATE. AN

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.791
INDEPENDENT PROCESS- AND THAT

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:53.359
INDEPENDENT PROCESS NEEDS TO BE

02:03:53.425 --> 02:03:55.161
INSTITUTIONALIZED SO THAT THE

02:03:55.227 --> 02:03:57.229
PUBLIC CAN RELY UPON IT AND THE

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.430
PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE

02:03:58.497 --> 02:03:59.698
PUBLIC CAN MEASURE AT THE

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.634
PUBLIC CAN SEE IT. AND AGAIN

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:02.802
THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE EVIDENCE

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:04.203
BASED ON BASED ON THE DATA THAT

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:05.471
GETS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:08.841
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR WORDS I

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:11.644

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:13.679
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M AND

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:14.747
I'M HOPING THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:16.482
LISTENING BECAUSE MANY OF THESE

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:17.616
THINGS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:19.919
BEFORE MEMBERSHIP BEFORE- IN

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:23.122
SOME FORM AND- AND WE STILL

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:25.024
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO.

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.458
WHAT ROLE DO WE PLAY BUT I WHAT

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:28.561
I'M AS I'M LISTENING TO OF THE

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:30.763
GENTLEMAN IT'S CLEAR THAT THAT

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.598
THE ROLE WE PLAY OBVIOUSLY IS

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:34.266
THAT WE MUST HAVE POLICY THAT

02:04:34.333 --> 02:04:37.536
IS UNIFORM. STATEWIDE WE TRIED

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:39.305
THAT WOULD BODY CAMERAS AND I

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:40.306
HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BODY

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:41.640
CAMERAS YET WE HAVE NO STATE

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:44.176
WIDE BODY CAMERA POLICY. AND IF

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:45.377
YOU REMEMBER WE TRIED TO DO

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.346
THAT AND IT WAS KILLED AND SO

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:48.447
I'M JUST SAYING THAT A LOT OF

02:04:48.514 --> 02:04:49.048
THE THINGS WE NEED TO GO BACK

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:51.183
AND LOOK BECAUSE- THEY SIMPLY

02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:52.818
IF AND THE SENATE HAVE TRIED TO

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:54.019
DO MANY OF THESE THINGS AND I

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:55.588
THINK AS OUR- AS OUR COMMISSION

02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:56.922
MEETINGS. AS THIS COMMITTEE

02:04:56.989 --> 02:04:58.824
MEETS WE PROBABLY NEED TO GO

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:00.092
LOOK AT ALL THE BILLS AND WE

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:01.594
HAVE SOME KIND OF THE NOT. A

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.596
SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS THAT

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.097
REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:06.699
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE ISSUES

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:08.667
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE AND

02:05:08.734 --> 02:05:09.835
THAT MANY OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.503
ARE HERE- ON THESE PANELS HAVE

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:12.538
BEEN A PART OF IT ONE WAY OR

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:14.773
THE OTHER. AND ONCE WE DECIDE

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:15.608
THAT THESE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:17.042
ARE CRITICAL THAT ARE EXTREMELY

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:19.445
IMPORTANT- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:05:19.511 --> 02:05:20.913
TO WRESTLE WITH THE HARD ISSUE

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.216
OF ADDRESSING. THAT ISSUE- AS

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:25.618
WELL AS A DRESSING IS AS

02:05:25.684 --> 02:05:27.286
SOMEONE IS MENTION THE IN THE

02:05:27.353 --> 02:05:29.188
UNDERLYING CAUSE OF MUCH OF THE

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.956
DISPARITY IN POLICING WHICH IS

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:33.259
RACISM. AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:35.060
THAT IN TERMS OF THE HISTORICAL

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.428
TREATMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:39.031
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT LEADS US

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:40.633
TO LOOKING AT A JOINT FLOYD

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:41.700
THAT COMES OUT OF OUR WHOLE

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.002
HISTORY OF LYNCHINGS AND

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:45.237
BURNINGS AND- AND DISREGARD FOR

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:47.006
THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:48.741
AND IT HAS RESULTED OVER THE

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.743
YEARS AS WE HAVE NO IN THE DISK

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.444
IN THE TREATMENT OF THEM IN

BEING LESS THAN HUMAN SELF I

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:54.880

REGARDING EIGHTY THREE NINETY

02:06:50.836 --> 02:06:53.038
TWO. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:54.573
I APPRECIATED THAT WHEN IT WAS

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:55.908
TIME TO VOTE AFTER ALL THE

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:57.609
DISCUSSION OF AND- HAVE BEEN

02:06:57.676 --> 02:07:00.612
HAD. WE RECEIVED THE NOTICE

02:07:00.679 --> 02:07:03.048
FROM PORAC THAT THEY HAD

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:04.750
WITHDRAWN THEIR- THEIR THEIR

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:06.919
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THEY

02:07:06.986 --> 02:07:08.253
HAD ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:09.788
WITH DR WEBBER WHICH WAS

02:07:09.855 --> 02:07:11.824
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:13.525
REALLY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY

02:07:13.592 --> 02:07:16.862
MUCH- BUT MR TEACHER I THE YOU

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:19.398
KNOW LOOKING AT THE TITLE OF

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:22.401
TODAY'S. HEARING WHY IS IT SO

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:23.002
HARD TO HOLD POLICE

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:25.004
ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK THAT

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:27.639
THAT'S THAT THAT IS THE PERFECT

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:28.807
QUESTION TO BE ASKED AND I

02:07:28.874 --> 02:07:30.943
THINK THAT. AS AN ATTORNEY IN

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:33.412
THIRTY YEARS AND I SINCERELY

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:34.013
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF SO

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:36.982
MANY. IT IS WHAT WE NEED IS TO

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.917
CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES IT'S TOO

02:07:38.984 --> 02:07:41.787
EASY TO SAY. NOBODY WANTS THE

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:44.189
BAD APPLES NOBODY WANTS WE ALL

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:45.691
WANT TO HOLD OUR POLICE

02:07:45.758 --> 02:07:48.227
ACCOUNTABLE WE THEY THEY GO TO

02:07:48.293 --> 02:07:51.296
THE GOOD POLICE DO NOT WANT TO

02:07:51.363 --> 02:07:51.930
THE BALLOT POLICE GETTING AWAY

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:54.433
WITH THINGS. SOMEHOW THEY DO

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.802
THEY DO GET AWAY WITH IT- SO

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:58.771
CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES IT IS

02:07:58.837 --> 02:08:00.739
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- DEAN

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:02.941
CHAMBER IN SKI I APPRECIATE THE

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:05.177
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE NOT JUST

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.645
ON THIS TOPIC BUT ON SO MANY

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:09.915
OTHERS- I SINCERELY APPRECIATE

02:08:09.982 --> 02:08:12.451
YOUR VOICE. AND I AM SO GLAD

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:14.420
THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE CHAIR

02:08:14.486 --> 02:08:17.056
GIPSON- INVITED YOU TO BE PART

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.724
OF THIS PANEL BECAUSE YOUR

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.759
VOICE WAS NEEDED HERE IT

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:22.394
ABSOLUTELY WAS NEEDED HERE AND

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:24.763
I THINK THAT. THE YEARS YOU'VE

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:25.964
TALKED ABOUT A VERY

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:28.167
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT REVISING THE

02:08:28.233 --> 02:08:31.103
PAIN ACT IS SOMETHING THAT- DR

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:35.407
WEBER'S TALKED ABOUT. AND HAS-

02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:37.142
BROUGHT THIS TO ON MANY OF. AND

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.645
I THINK HEARING YOUR VOICE ON

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:42.815
THIS- REMINDS US. THAT THAT IS

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:45.117
PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE OTHER

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:47.319
PART IS AS IS THE MATH MUCH OF

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:50.322
BY SOMEBODY IS EXPANDING TRUST.

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:51.590
SO WE HAVE T CLOSE LOOPHOLES

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:54.193
WITH EXPAND THE TRUST AND THAT

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:56.161
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY ANSWER

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:59.298
BUT IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT.

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:00.933
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I DO WANT

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:02.634
TO ASK ABOUT IS THAT WE HEAR

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:04.970
OPPOSING VIEWS REGARDING THE

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:07.473
COMMUNITY AND CIVILIAN-

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:09.775
PURCHASE A PATIENT. IN THE

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:11.743
OVERSIGHT ON THE ONE HAND WE

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:13.345
TALK ABOUT CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:16.415
OF AGENCIES BEING PART OF THE

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:18.717
EVALUATION ON THE OTHER HAND WE

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:22.121
HEAR THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:23.722
WHO HAVE THE TRAINING WHICH-

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.257
NECESSARILY EXCLUDES OUR

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:26.925
COMMUNITY. THAT ONLY THOSE WHO

02:09:26.992 --> 02:09:28.560
HAD THE POLICE TRAINING TO BE

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:30.529
PART OF THE VALUATION ON

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:34.733
POLICEMEN MISCONDUCT. SO MY

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.901
FIRST QUESTION IS. SHE IS THE

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:37.703
REASON THE QUESTION SHOULD THE

02:09:37.769 --> 02:09:40.672
COMMUNITY- SHOULD BE USED SO

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:42.741
BILLION OUT PARTICIPATION BE

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:45.244
PART OF THE EVALUATION WHEN

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.045
WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICE

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:51.216
MISCONDUCT. MISTER HENDERSON

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:52.551
WANTS TO TAKE THE QUESTION

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:55.087
FOLLOW WITH- DEAN SOME RISKY

02:09:55.154 --> 02:09:56.722
SURE SO I WILL JUST SAY JUST

02:09:56.788 --> 02:09:57.756
SPEAKING TO THAT QUESTION

02:09:57.823 --> 02:09:59.558
SPECIFICALLY HAVING CIVILIANS

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:00.492
AND HAVING TRAINED

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:02.161
PROFESSIONALS ARE NOT MUTUALLY

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:04.163
EXCLUSIVE I THINK THEY CAN WORK

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:05.097
TOGETHER BUT I THINK IT'S

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:06.031
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:08.033
CREDIBILITY THAT WE HAVE.

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:10.335
COMMUNITY MEMBERS SET ON SOME

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:11.370
OF THESE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.405
COMMUNITY MEMBERS REVIEW SOME

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:15.240
OF THE INFORMATION AND THAT WE

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:16.909
HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS EXAMINE

02:10:16.975 --> 02:10:18.944
AND BE A PART OF THE

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:20.712
INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS AND

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:23.282
THAT'S INFORMED BY IT LED BY OR

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.350
PARTNERED WITH. TRAINED

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:26.485
PROFESSIONALS THAT DO

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:27.886
INVESTIGATIONS TRAINED

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.321
PROFESSIONALS THAT DO HAVE

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:30.622
LEGAL BACKGROUNDS TRAINED

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:31.924
PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE FAMILIAR

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.893
WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.728
AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCESSES

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:39.097
ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCIPLINE

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.732
THAT'S MADE IT SO DIFFICULT

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.134
PART OF THE CHALLENGE I THINK

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.535
IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.737
INDEPENDENT TRACKS. THAT

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:47.472
DISAPPOINT THE PUBLIC'S

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:50.375
PERCEPTION OF WHAT DISCIPLINE

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:51.843
COULD LOOK LIKE AND IT'S

02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:53.946
SEPARATED FROM WHAT THE PUBLIC

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:55.681
BELIEVES DISCIPLINE SHOULD LOOK

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.083
LIKE AND TO THE DEGREE WE HAVE

02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:59.184
THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE'VE

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:00.252
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:02.321
TODAY WE CAN REDUCE AND

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:04.089
ELIMINATE OR LOWER SOME OF

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.524
THOSE BARRIERS BY HAVING AN

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:07.526
INTENTIONALITY. OF SHARING

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:09.394
INFORMATION MORE BROADLY WITH

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:13.465
THE PUBLIC AND HAVING THEM SIT

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:14.032
AT THE TABLE I DON'T THINK-

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:16.969
THAT WE SPEAK TO OUR DEAL WITH

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:18.737
OR ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:22.941
TRUST. BY THAT NOT HAVING THE

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:25.077
COMMUNITY AT LEAST BE INVITED

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:27.012
OR HAVING A DIRECT SEAT AND

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:28.413
PART OF THE PROCESS. TO

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.681
UNDERSTAND OR AT LEAST HAVE

02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:31.283
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.217
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.819
WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS THAT WE

02:11:33.885 --> 02:11:36.188
END UP PUTTING TOGETHER. TO

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:37.623
SHAPE OR IMPROVE THE SYSTEM

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:38.724
THAT WORK WERE ALL TALKING

02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:40.125
ABOUT COMING UP WITH SOME OF

02:11:40.192 --> 02:11:43.128
THOSE SOLUTIONS I DO. I THINK

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:44.363
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MAKING

02:11:44.429 --> 02:11:47.766
SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY. HAS IT

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:48.400
AT THE VERY LEAST ACCESS TO THE

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:51.003
INFORMATION. AND AT THE BEST

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:53.071
END OF THE SCALE HAS A SEAT AT

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:56.308
THE TABLE OF PARTICIPATION AND

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:58.043
WHAT THOSE PROCESSES COULD LOOK

02:11:58.110 --> 02:11:59.411
LIKE AT I THINK HAVING THOSE

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:00.646
DOORS BE OPEN IT WOULD BE

02:12:00.712 --> 02:12:03.382
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND AGAIN WE

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:04.349
DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:05.951
WHEEL AS TO WHAT THIS CAN LOOK

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:07.119
LIKE A LOT OF THE CIVILIAN

02:12:07.185 --> 02:12:08.920
OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:11.123
WAY TO HAVE. A CIVILIAN

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:13.292
OVERSIGHT AGENCY I WILL SAY

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.860
THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:17.262
HELPFUL THAN NOT FOR- AN

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:19.898
OUTLINE. OF WHAT INFORMATION IS

02:12:19.965 --> 02:12:22.034
AVAILABLE FOR THESE AGENCIES SO

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.669
THAT WE ALL KNOW AND IT'S NOT A

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:25.671
CATCH AS CATCH CAN COUNTY TO

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:27.272
COUNTY WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE

02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:29.408
AVAILABLE TO THEM. WHAT TYPES

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:31.343
OF INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED

02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:33.779
WHAT TYPES OF INDEPENDENT

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:34.680
INVESTIGATION WILL THEY BE

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:36.581
LOOKING AT. AND THAT'S ONE OF

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:37.482
THE MOVEMENT'S THAT'S TAKING

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:39.051
PLACE RIGHT NOW WHEN WE WERE

02:12:39.117 --> 02:12:41.053
TALKING EARLIER ABOUT- LIKE THE

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:43.488
MEASURE B. AND SAN DIEGO ONE OF

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:44.323
THE THINGS THAT THEY FOCUSED ON

02:12:44.389 --> 02:12:46.758
WAYS. SPECIFICALLY EXPANDING

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:48.560
THEIR JURISDICTION AN ACCESS TO

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:49.761
INFORMATION AND THAT'S OF

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:51.663
MOVEMENT THAT'S TAKING PLACE

02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:53.031
JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:54.933
BUT THOSE ARE LOCAL EXPANSIONS

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.102
THAT'S LOCAL LEGISLATION. IF WE

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:59.171
HAD FEDERAL I MEAN FOR A STATE

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:01.707
LEGISLATION TAKING THE PLAY AND

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:03.909
DEFINING WHAT INFORMATION WILL

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.043
BE SHARED WITH AN OVERSIGHT

02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:07.245
AGENCY WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:08.747
TRANSPARENT TO CIVILIAN

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:10.749
AGENCIES. THAT WOULD GO A LONG

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:12.384
WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:14.653
COMMUNITIES ALL COMMUNITIES HAD

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:15.854
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AND I

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:17.122
WILL SAY IS THAT A FINAL CABBIE

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:18.323
OUT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:19.124
REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVEN'T

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:20.992
TALKED ABOUT IT TODAY. THE ROLE

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:22.160
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:24.563
FAILED TO PLAY IN PURSUING THAT

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:25.964
ROLE AND SHARING THAT

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:27.632
INFORMATION THIS PAST

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:28.834
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:29.901
THE TRANSGRESSIONS WE TALKED

02:13:29.968 --> 02:13:31.536
ABOUT. AND A LOT OF THE FEDERAL

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:33.572
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE ALLUDED

02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:35.207
TO AND MANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS

02:13:35.273 --> 02:13:36.808
TYPICALLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:38.210
PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:39.444
THE MOST THE PREVIOUS

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:42.814
ADMINISTRATION. ALL WOULD THAT

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:43.415
WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN PLAY AND

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.550
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IN

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:47.052
THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION THAT

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.820
WAS THE AGENCY WHERE WE SEE THE

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.255
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING.

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:51.223
THAT'S THE AGENCY THAT

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:52.357
EVALUATES THE PATTERN AND

02:13:52.424 --> 02:13:53.992
PRACTICE OF VALUATION. THAT IS

02:13:54.059 --> 02:13:55.227
THE AGENCY OF THOSE O THE

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:56.561
LAWYERS THAT HAVE BEEN CUT TO

02:13:56.628 --> 02:13:58.430
LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT THEY

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.668
LEFT A GLARING HOLE AND AN

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.604

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:10.375
WITH OUT LEADERSHIP FROM THE

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:11.943
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT AN

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:13.678
OPPORTUNITY FOR US AT THE STATE

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:16.915
LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:18.250
FIX SOME OF THESE ISSUES. MY

02:14:18.316 --> 02:14:20.419
POINT IS BEING TO BRING IT FULL

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:21.686
CIRCLE TO WHAT I WAS TALKING

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:23.155

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:35.434
INSTITUTIONALIZE WHAT ACCESS

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:37.936

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:40.705
DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.641
LOOKS LIKE WHAT DATA LOOKS LIKE.

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:43.775
AT THE STATE LEVEL THROUGH

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.644
LEGISLATION ABSOLUE ACTION THAT

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.345
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO EVERYONE

02:14:47.412 --> 02:14:49.014
THAT WOULD LIFT ALL OF THE

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.482
COMMUNITIES HERE IF THEY HAD

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:52.684

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.753
BE SHARED WITH THEM THAT DAY

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.421

SOMETHING OF A QUESTION ON THE

02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:38.990
ISSUE OF CLOSING LOOPHOLES. AND

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:42.093

SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. LETHAL

02:21:55.974 --> 02:21:58.643
FORCE LYING ON THE JOB SEXUAL

02:21:58.710 --> 02:22:00.678
ASSAULT OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:03.448
THE JOB- WE HAVE SEEN

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:04.816
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR RARE

02:22:04.883 --> 02:22:06.484
FORTUNATELY BUT THEY HAPPEN

02:22:06.551 --> 02:22:08.486
WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO RESIGN

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.521
BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION-

02:22:10.588 --> 02:22:12.056
WHETHER IT'S AND I A OR A

02:22:12.123 --> 02:22:13.024
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:15.960
COMPLETE. AND ESSENTIALLY

02:22:16.027 --> 02:22:16.828
BURIED THE RECORDS FROM EVER

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:19.230
COMING TO LIGHT OF DAY THEY'RE

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:20.632
NOT TOUCHABLE WITH THE PUBLIC

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:23.101
RECORDS ACT REQUEST I YOU CAN'T

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:25.937
GET THEM- SO MY BILL MADE IT

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:27.505
THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:29.540
STALLED OUT IN THE SENATE- I

02:22:29.607 --> 02:22:30.808
THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE WE

02:22:30.875 --> 02:22:32.610
SHOULD. THINK ABOUT REVISITING

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:35.680
WITH LEGISLATION- AND WE HAD

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:37.015
WORK SOMETHING OUT THERE WAS A

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.249
FRAMEWORK THERE THAT HAD BEEN

02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:40.919
WORKED OUT WITH- WITH POLICE

02:22:40.985 --> 02:22:43.121
CHIEFS WERE SHARES AND WITH

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:45.356
PORAC- THAT WOULD PROTECT THE

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:46.658
OFFICERS FROM HAVING RECORDS

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:47.725
RELEASED THAT MADE THEM LOOK

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:49.227
BAD. WHERE THE INVESTIGATION

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:53.031
ACTUALLY- WAS ON SUSTAIN OR-

02:22:53.097 --> 02:22:54.732
RESULTED IN EXONERATIONS THE

02:22:54.799 --> 02:22:56.601
OFFICER. SO I MEAN WE'RE

02:22:56.668 --> 02:22:58.136
TALKING A VERY NARROW SLICE OF

02:22:58.202 --> 02:23:00.171
THINGS HERE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:02.640
THAT IS INVESTIGATED- YOU KNOW

02:23:02.707 --> 02:23:03.741
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:23:03.808 --> 02:23:06.210
WE'RE- REQUIRING THAT THE

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:07.745
DEPARTMENT'S. COMPLETE THE

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:09.547
INVESTIGATION AND ARE NOT

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:11.549
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXPLOIT THIS

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:12.817
LOOPHOLE WHERE THEY THEY CAN

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:14.552
RESIGN AND ESSENTIALLY STOPPED

02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:15.820
INVESTIGATION AND THEN YOU

02:23:15.887 --> 02:23:17.355
DON'T. HAVE ANYTHING BECAUSE

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:18.489
THERE WAS NEVER A FINDING AT

02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:20.291
ALL WHETHER SUSTAINED

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:22.060
MISCONDUCT FINDING OR

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.895
EXONERATED FINDING OR AND I'M

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:25.496
SUSTAIN THE EVIDENCE WASN'T

02:23:25.563 --> 02:23:27.231
CLEAR TO SAY ONE WAY OR

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:31.035
ANOTHER- SO I THINK THAT'S- AND

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:33.071
THAT FITS RIGHT INTO THE SB

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:33.938
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FRAMEWORK

02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:36.641
FROM SKINNER'S BILL FROM TWENTY

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.142
EIGHTEEN. IT IT CLOSES A

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:39.911
LOOPHOLE- THAT HAS BEEN

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:41.913
EXPLOITED AND IT ALSO PROTECTS

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:44.148
THE OFFICERS BECAUSE IT IT

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.484
WOULD CLARIFY ALSO. THAT IF

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:49.187
YOU. ARE IF THE INVESTIGATION

02:23:49.253 --> 02:23:50.221
WAS COMPLETE AND YOU WERE

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:51.923
EXONERATED OR THERE WASN'T

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:54.292
ASSISTING FINDING MISCONDUCT-

02:23:54.359 --> 02:23:55.927
THEY COULD REST ASSURED THAT

02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:56.694
THOSE RECORDS WOULD NOT COME

02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:58.496
OUT IN THE PUBLIC. AND SUBJECT

02:23:58.563 --> 02:23:59.697
THEM TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY THAT

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:01.899
WAS ON WARRANT SO I THINK WE

02:24:01.966 --> 02:24:04.068
CAN PICK UP ON THAT I'M JUST

02:24:04.135 --> 02:24:05.036
MORE THROWING THIS OUT THERE I

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:06.971
DON'T NEED. NECESSARILY UNLESS

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:08.272
SOMEBODY'S GOT A COMMENT FROM

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:10.241

STILL AROUND BUT- I JUST WANTED

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:16.948
TO THROW THAT OUT THERE IS AN

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:18.850
IDEA FOR. SOMETHING THAT WE

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:20.418
COULD WORK ON THAT I THINK

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:24.555
WOULD HAVE. A BIPARTISAN-

02:24:24.622 --> 02:24:26.557
SUPPORT AND IT'S A IT'S A

02:24:26.624 --> 02:24:29.827
LEGISLATIVE. FIX TO A LOOPHOLE

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:32.897
THAT THAT RESULTS IN- OFFICERS

02:24:32.964 --> 02:24:34.932
BEING ABLE TO RESIGN UNDER A

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:35.933
CLOUD OF STREET NEAR

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.135
INVESTIGATION FROM ONE

02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:38.603
DEPARTMENT. AND THEN GO TO

02:24:38.669 --> 02:24:40.471
ANOTHER DEPARTMENT- AND THE

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:41.472
PUBLIC NEVER KNOWS ANYTHING

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:43.041
ABOUT THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT AND

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.142
WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IT'S

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:45.843
HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT SEVERAL

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:48.746
TIMES. ALREADY WE'VE RECEIVED

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:51.049
OFFICERS THAT LEFT OTHER

02:24:51.115 --> 02:24:53.951
DEPARTMENTS- THEY HAD BEEN

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.286
ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT THEY

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:57.155
COMMITTED SIMILAR MISCONDUCT.

02:24:57.221 --> 02:24:59.090
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A 1% OF

02:24:59.157 --> 02:25:00.958
1% I MEAN THESE ARE. THE NUMBER

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:02.493
OF BAD APPLES I TRULY BELIEVE

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.230
THIS IS QUITE SMALL- BUT YOU

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:06.831
KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:08.766
TRUST. AND TRUST BETWEEN THE

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:09.500
COMMUNITY AND THE LAW

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:11.569
ENFORCEMENT. FOLKS THAT SERVE

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:13.171
THE COMMUNITY- WE NEED MORE

02:25:13.237 --> 02:25:14.739
TRANSPARENCY THAT'S THE ONLY

02:25:14.806 --> 02:25:16.274
WAY I KNOW OF TO RESTORE THAT

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.176
TRUST. SO YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.777
THAT COMMENT I APPRECIATE THE

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:21.746
TIME THANK YOU HAVE- MISTER

02:25:21.813 --> 02:25:23.548
HENDERSON WANT TO RESPOND AND

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:25.683
THEN WE HAVE ABOUT- FOUR

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:27.285
MINUTES BEFORE WE START GOING

02:25:27.351 --> 02:25:28.286
ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:30.221
DELIBERATIONS. SO MR ANDERSON

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:31.289
YEAH I WAS GONNA AGREE WITH

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:32.390
EVERYTHING MAYBE SOME WOMEN

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:34.325
SAID BUT ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT

02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:36.360
THE OTHER- AGENCY I JUST WANNA

02:25:36.427 --> 02:25:37.628
KEEP REITERATING THAT THE

02:25:37.695 --> 02:25:39.030
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHTS THAT DO THE

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:40.465
ACCOUNTABILITY ARE ALSO

02:25:40.531 --> 02:25:41.833
RESTRICTED WHEN THAT PROCESS

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:43.134
HAPPENS MANY OF THEM DON'T

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.069
HAVE. JURISDICTION TO CONTINUE

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:46.637
THEIR INVESTIGATIONS EVEN

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:47.538
THOUGH THEY OPERATE

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:48.840
INDEPENDENTLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.575
AND THAT JUST EXACERBATES THE

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.477
NEED TO HAVE. SOMETHING THAT

02:25:52.543 --> 02:25:53.511
ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE MORE

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:55.980
DIRECTLY I WILL SAY THERE ALSO

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:57.849
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.750
AND AGGRESSIVE ABOUT THE

02:25:59.817 --> 02:26:03.121
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THESE-TRANSGRESSIONS THAT THERE ARE

02:26:03.187 --> 02:26:04.889
OTHER MEASUREMENTS AND MARKERS

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:06.390
THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON TO I

02:26:06.457 --> 02:26:07.825
JUST WANT TO SHARE THIS WHILE

02:26:07.892 --> 02:26:08.493
WE'RE ALL HAVING A

02:26:08.559 --> 02:26:10.294
CONVERSATION. SOME OF THOSE CAN

02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:11.662
BE FOUND IN RECORDS THAT

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:13.631
ALREADY EXIST AND I WILL SAY IN

02:26:13.698 --> 02:26:14.866
THE CRIMINAL COURTS WHEN YOU'RE

02:26:14.932 --> 02:26:16.400
LOOKING AT THE CONFLATION OF

02:26:16.467 --> 02:26:18.202
CASES THAT HAVE BEEN. THROWN

02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:19.303
OUT AND MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS

02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:20.938
THEIR OFTENTIMES RECORDS IN

02:26:21.005 --> 02:26:22.140
THERE THAT INDICATE BAD

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:23.808
BEHAVIORS FROM OFFICERS THAT

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:25.676
CAN BE EVALUATED ALSO IN THE

02:26:25.743 --> 02:26:28.246
CIVIL LAWSUITS THAT TAKE PLACE.

02:26:28.312 --> 02:26:30.047
SO EVEN WHEN AN OFFICER IS

02:26:30.114 --> 02:26:32.750
ALLOWED TO GET OUT FROM A

02:26:32.817 --> 02:26:34.218
COMPLETE INVESTIGATION THAT

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:35.286
RESULTS AND CRIMINAL

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:36.721
ACCOUNTABILITY ARE IN INTERNAL

02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:38.956
AFFAIRS- ACCOUNTABILITY OR

02:26:39.023 --> 02:26:39.891
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:40.758
ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:42.560
LEFT. THERE'S OFTENTIMES A

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:44.362
LAWSUIT THAT SOMETIMES RESULTS

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:46.564
AND FINDINGS AND INFORMATION

02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:48.366
THAT SHINES THE LIGHT ON MANY

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:50.234
OF THESE TRANSGRESSIONS AND IN

02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:51.969
THIS DAY AND AGE WITH LIMITED

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:54.205
RESOURCES AND BUDGET. WE HAVE

02:26:54.272 --> 02:26:55.406
TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT WHERE

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:57.308
THOSE RECORDS ARE BEING CREATED

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:59.477
THAT ARE SHINING THE LIGHT ON

02:26:59.544 --> 02:27:01.846
WHO THOSE BAD ACTORS ARE. WHERE

02:27:01.913 --> 02:27:04.115
THOSE TRANSGRESSIONS ARE. AND I

02:55:15.838 --> 02:55:17.039
JUST POLICE. NOW WITH RESPECT

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:19.675
TO POLICE- IN SOME OF THE

02:55:19.742 --> 02:55:23.646
LOOPHOLES- THAT- THAT THAT I'VE

02:55:23.713 --> 02:55:25.848
SEEN- THAT CAN IMPACT THE

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.950
POLICE ADMINISTRATORS ABILITY

02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:29.785
TO TAKE DISCIPLINE OR THE OF

02:55:29.852 --> 02:55:31.721
BIGGER AND WHICH THEY DO SO-

02:55:31.787 --> 02:55:35.024
COME IN THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL

02:55:35.091 --> 02:55:36.893
OF RIGHTS ACT- ONE EXAMPLE

02:55:36.959 --> 02:55:38.928
WOULD BE- THE REMEDY PROVISION

02:55:38.995 --> 02:55:41.197
THAT'S GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:43.299
THREE THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE.

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:45.368
ONE OF THE REMEDIES FOR

02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:47.737
VIOLATION OF THE- P. O. B. R.

02:55:47.803 --> 02:55:50.606
IS SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE AND-

02:55:50.673 --> 02:55:51.874
WELL THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:54.210
ME WHEN THERE IS AN INTENTIONAL

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:57.179
OR- I'M AT AN AGENCY THAT'S

02:55:57.246 --> 02:56:00.516
WITH MALICE. TO HAVE SOMEONE AN

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:02.184
OFFICER'S ADMISSION THAT THEY

02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:03.853
DID SOMETHING WRONG THROWN OUT

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:06.255
BECAUSE AN INVESTIGATOR MADE A

02:56:06.322 --> 02:56:08.124
MINOR MISTAKE OR NEGLIGENCE

02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:09.592
MISTAKE SEEMS DRACONIAN TO ME

02:56:09.659 --> 02:56:11.360
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

02:56:11.427 --> 02:56:13.462
COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO TAKE. A

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:15.865
LOOK AT ANOTHER ISSUE WAS

02:56:15.932 --> 02:56:17.133
MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATUE

02:56:17.199 --> 02:56:19.101
LIMITATIONS CONTAINED IN THE

02:56:19.168 --> 02:56:20.169
PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:22.371
ACT OF THERE IS A ONE YEAR

02:56:22.438 --> 02:56:25.875
STATURE LIMITATIONS AND THAT-

02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:27.376
BELIEVE IT OR NOT SME OF THESE

02:56:27.443 --> 02:56:28.878
INVESTIGATIONS CAN TAKE MORE

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:31.514
THAN A YEAR AND SO. THAT IS ONE

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.282
THING THAT YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK

02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:35.952
AT IT ONE YEAR IS KIND OF AN

02:56:36.018 --> 02:56:38.654
ARTIFICIAL NUMBER- AT LEAST

02:56:38.721 --> 02:56:40.022
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT IS THAT

02:56:40.089 --> 02:56:41.824
GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD THERE

02:56:41.891 --> 02:56:44.193
BE MORE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ONE

02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:45.461
YEAR STATUTE LIMITATIONS THAT

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:46.829
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:50.199
PERHAPS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT

02:56:50.266 --> 02:56:50.967
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT-

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:52.368
ANOTHER. OBSTACLE IF YOU WILL

02:56:52.435 --> 02:56:53.769
AND HOLDING OFFICERS

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:56.205
ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE P. O. B. R.

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:59.542
IS THE LEVEL AND- L. DISCIPLINE

02:56:59.608 --> 02:57:01.610
IN WHICH AN OFFICER IS ENTITLED

02:57:01.677 --> 02:57:03.212
TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.

02:57:03.279 --> 02:57:04.113
AND THESE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.715
APPEALS THEY CAN BE TIME

02:57:05.781 --> 02:57:08.384
CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE- BUT

02:57:08.451 --> 02:57:10.019
FOR EXAMPLE THE CONSTITUTION

02:57:10.086 --> 02:57:13.089
ONLY REQUIRES AN APPEAL FOR

02:57:13.155 --> 02:57:14.357
SUSPENSION OF FIVE DAYS OR LESS.

02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:15.424
HE'LL BE AREN'T REQUIRES AN

02:57:15.491 --> 02:57:16.525
APPEAL WHEN THERE'S A WRITTEN

02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:19.095
REPRIMAND. AND BECAUSE OF

02:57:19.161 --> 02:57:19.996
PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

02:57:20.062 --> 02:57:21.731
PRINCIPLES THERE'S KIND OF A

02:57:21.797 --> 02:57:23.265
DISINCENTIVE THEREFORE SOME

02:57:23.332 --> 02:57:24.867
AGENCIES THE RICHER WRITTEN

02:57:24.934 --> 02:57:28.771
REPRIMAND FOR EXAMPLE- BECAUSE-

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:29.338
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN

02:57:29.405 --> 02:57:31.540
APPEAL AND- I'VE HAD PERSONALLY

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.808
HAVE HAD CASES WERE WRITTEN

02:57:32.875 --> 02:57:35.911
REPRIMAND HAS RESULTED IN A

02:57:35.978 --> 02:57:39.048
THREE DAY. APPEAL ON. ANOTHER

02:57:39.115 --> 02:57:40.883
POTENTIAL OF SAYING THAT THE

02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:41.984
COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO TAKE A

02:57:42.051 --> 02:57:43.519
LOOK AT WITH RESPECT TO THE PO

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:46.322
BR- IS THERE IS A CASE CALLED

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:49.825
LABIO- AND REALLY DEALS WITH

02:57:49.892 --> 02:57:51.894
THE SUPERVISOR QUESTIONING AN

02:57:51.961 --> 02:57:52.995
EMPLOYEE BEFORE THERE'S AN

02:57:53.062 --> 02:57:55.097
OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION AND

02:57:55.164 --> 02:57:57.767
AGAIN THE DRACONIAN REMEDY OF

02:57:57.833 --> 02:58:00.503
SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE OF THAT

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:03.205
IS A SURGEON THAT- I THINK

02:58:03.272 --> 02:58:06.275
SHOULD BE REVISITED AT SOME

02:58:06.342 --> 02:58:07.810
POINT BY THE LEGISLATURE.

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:10.679
ANOTHER OF POINT IN THE POTR

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:12.515
WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT CODE

02:58:12.581 --> 02:58:14.650
SECTION THIRTY THREE B. O. G.

02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:15.885
THERE'S A STATEMENT EARLIER

02:58:15.951 --> 02:58:17.219
ABILITY WAS BY MR STAGNATING

02:58:17.286 --> 02:58:18.754
INDICATED THAT OFFICERS DO NOT

02:58:18.821 --> 02:58:21.490
GET A RIGHT TO. THE MATERIALS

02:58:21.557 --> 02:58:23.359
OF THAT THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE

02:58:23.426 --> 02:58:25.961
AS THEY'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER-

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:26.796
BEFORE THE BEFORE THEY'RE

02:58:26.862 --> 02:58:29.432
INTERROGATED. AND THAT ONE

02:58:29.498 --> 02:58:30.366
THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE- BUT

02:58:30.433 --> 02:58:32.401
THERE IS A PROVISION AND THE

02:58:32.468 --> 02:58:33.669
SANTA ANA- PEACE OFFICERS

02:58:33.736 --> 02:58:35.438
ASSOCIATION CASE INTERPRETED

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:37.473
THE LAW THIS WAY THAT IF THERE

02:58:37.540 --> 02:58:39.075
IS TO BE A SECOND INTERROGATION

02:58:39.141 --> 02:58:41.043
OF THE OFFICER. I'VE BEEN THERE

02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:42.378
ARE POTENTIALLY ENTITLED TO

02:58:42.445 --> 02:58:43.813
WHATEVER THE INVESTIGATOR HAS

02:58:43.879 --> 02:58:45.681
IN THEIR RECORDS. OTHER WITNESS

02:58:45.748 --> 02:58:47.316
STATEMENTS AND EVIDENCE

02:58:47.383 --> 02:58:48.551
COLLECTED AND THINGS OF THAT

02:58:48.617 --> 02:58:50.986
NATURE AND THAT IS JUST. IN MY

02:58:51.053 --> 02:58:51.487
VIEW NOT A SOUND

02:58:51.554 --> 02:58:53.489
INVESTORSOBSERVER'S ON THING

02:58:53.556 --> 02:58:55.324
THAT. I DON'T THINK THE

02:58:55.391 --> 02:58:56.892
LEGISLATURE INTENDED WHEN THEY

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:58.527
ENACTED THIRTY THREE OH THREE

02:58:58.594 --> 02:58:59.595
G. BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT

02:58:59.662 --> 02:59:03.265
WANT TO LOOK AT AS WELL- AND-

02:59:03.332 --> 02:59:04.333
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:05.901
IDEAS WITH RESPECT TO THE PO

02:59:05.968 --> 02:59:08.170
BR. THAT I THINK THAT THE

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:08.804
COMMITTEE WANTS TO TAKE A LOOK

02:59:08.871 --> 02:59:11.874
AT. ALL OR MAY WANT TO TAKE A

02:59:11.941 --> 02:59:14.276
LOOK AT. I WOULD AND LASTLY

02:59:14.343 --> 02:59:15.544
WOULD BE. THERE WAS DISCUSSION

02:59:15.611 --> 02:59:17.847
ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY ANGLE AS

02:59:17.913 --> 02:59:21.083
FAR AS- HELP KHOBAR PROHIBITING

02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:22.618
TRANSPARENCY IN SOME RESPECTS

02:59:22.685 --> 02:59:24.053
AND I THINK. REALLY THE

02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:26.188
STATUTES THAT REALLY FOR TWO

02:59:26.255 --> 02:59:28.224
TRANSPARENCY ARE WHAT WE CALL

02:59:28.290 --> 02:59:29.558
THE PITCHES STATUTES. OF THE

02:59:29.625 --> 02:59:31.594
PEOPLE EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT

02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:32.995
SEVEN AND PARTICULAR EVIDENCE

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:34.630
CODE SECTION TEN FORTY THREE.

02:59:34.697 --> 02:59:36.532
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT DO-

02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:40.970
REQUIRE I JUST MOTIONS TO. FOR

02:59:41.036 --> 02:59:43.239
TRANSPARENCY OF MOST RECORDS-

02:59:43.305 --> 02:59:44.273

03:01:28.277 --> 03:01:29.878
ANTICIPATION THAT I TESTIFY

THAT I COME TO ADDRESS THIS

COMMITTEE AND THIS ALL TOO

03:01:42.691 --> 03:01:44.026
IMPORTANT TOPIC THE POLICE

REFORM AND HOLDING POLICE

03:01:46.362 --> 03:01:47.963
ACCOUNTABLE. IN A WAY IN WHICH

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:51.100
THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS ISSUE.

03:01:51.166 --> 03:01:53.135
THAT IS JUST AS AMERICAN AS

03:01:53.202 --> 03:01:55.771
APPLE PIE. AND IS THIS IS AS IS

03:01:55.838 --> 03:01:57.806
AS INSIDIOUS AS A CULVERT

03:01:57.873 --> 03:02:00.109
NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND IS JUST

03:02:00.175 --> 03:02:01.443
AS DIVISIVE AS ANY ISSUE THAT

03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:03.479
WE HAVE EVER FACED IN OUR GREAT

03:02:03.545 --> 03:02:04.780
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN IN THE

03:02:04.847 --> 03:02:06.949
COUNTRY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THE

03:02:07.016 --> 03:02:09.051
ISSUE IS ROOTED. IN THINGS THAT

03:02:09.118 --> 03:02:13.022
HAVE BEEN LONG HELD. DIVISIVE

03:02:13.088 --> 03:02:15.658
FOR OUR COUNTRY. ROOTED IN

03:02:15.724 --> 03:02:17.526
THINGS SUCH AS RACISM BIAS.

03:02:17.593 --> 03:02:21.330
PREJUDICE AND AFFORDING TWO

03:02:21.397 --> 03:02:22.931
SYSTEMS OF LAW WHERE POLICE

03:02:22.998 --> 03:02:24.800
OFFICERS ARE FAR TOO OFTEN NOT

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:26.802
HELD ACCOUNTABLE MUCH OF THIS

03:02:26.869 --> 03:02:30.339
IS DUE TO A PATCHWORK OF LAWS

03:02:30.406 --> 03:02:31.307
AND BENEFITS THAT POLICE

03:02:31.373 --> 03:02:33.075
OFFICERS ENJOY THAT AVERAGE

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:35.544
CITIZENS DO NOT. SOME OF IT IS

03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:37.046
ALSO DUE IN PART TO THE CULTURE

03:02:37.112 --> 03:02:38.714
OF POLICING WHICH EMBRACES A

NAME IS DEBORAH ROMERO S. AND

03:11:54.035 --> 03:11:55.637
I'M A PROFESSOR AT NORTHEASTERN

03:11:55.704 --> 03:11:57.606
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW HERE

03:11:57.672 --> 03:12:02.711
IN BOSTON. SOME OF THE TITLE OF

03:12:02.777 --> 03:12:05.647
THIS PRESENTATION IS WHY IS IT

03:12:05.714 --> 03:12:08.917
SO HARD TO HOLD POLICE

03:12:08.984 --> 03:12:11.286
ACCOUNTABLE FOR RISKY BEHAVIOR.

03:12:11.353 --> 03:12:12.954
FIRST OFF I WANT TO CHECK SOUND

03:12:13.021 --> 03:12:15.190
CAN PEOPLE HEAR ME WE CAN YOU

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:17.559
GO AND SEE YOU YES. PERFECT

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:20.328
THANK YOU I'M- WHEN I TALK TO

03:12:20.395 --> 03:12:22.330
MY STUDENTS I SAY THAT THE

03:12:22.397 --> 03:12:24.032
ANSWER IS AN ANSWER THAT'S BEEN

03:12:24.099 --> 03:12:26.534
GIVEN ALREADY TODAY WHICH IS

03:12:26.601 --> 03:12:29.170
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY.

03:12:29.237 --> 03:12:31.940
RIGHT NOW TO WEED OUT THE BAD

03:12:32.007 --> 03:12:34.309
OFFICERS SO THAT THE GOOD

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:38.313
OFFICERS CAN THRIVE. SOME

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:40.181
COUNTRIES SOME OF THE SPEAKERS

03:12:40.248 --> 03:12:42.183
MY EXPERIENCE THE EMPIRICAL

03:12:42.250 --> 03:12:43.952
DATA AND ALL THE STUDIES

03:12:44.019 --> 03:12:46.154
INDICATE THAT IT IS ALMOST

03:12:46.221 --> 03:12:49.457
IMPOSSIBLE. TO LAY OFF OR FIRE

03:12:49.524 --> 03:12:52.594
A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE OF

03:12:52.661 --> 03:12:55.597
UNION PROTECTIONS. AND THERE'S

03:12:55.664 --> 03:12:58.199
ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS LACK OF

03:12:58.266 --> 03:13:01.102
ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S THAT EVEN

03:13:01.169 --> 03:13:05.807
WHEN. YOU OR I OR SOMEONE

03:13:05.874 --> 03:13:08.310
INJURED BY THE POLICE USES THE

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:11.012
COURT SYSTEM AND FILES A

03:13:11.079 --> 03:13:15.684
LAWSUIT. THE OFFICER- DOES NOT

03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:18.253
BEAR THE COSTS OF ANY DAMAGES

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:20.055
ASSESSED NOW I WANT EXPLAINED

03:13:20.121 --> 03:13:23.725
THAT FOR A MINUTE. THE COURTS

03:13:23.792 --> 03:13:26.194
AND MUNICIPALITIES HOLD

03:13:26.261 --> 03:13:29.331
OFFICERS LIABLE FOR MISCONDUCT.

03:13:29.397 --> 03:13:31.232
EITHER BY SETTLEMENT OR BY

03:13:31.299 --> 03:13:34.903
VERDICT. NOW YOU MIGHT THINK

03:13:34.970 --> 03:13:37.539
THAT AS A RESULT THE OFFICERS

03:13:37.605 --> 03:13:40.342
WOULD PAY DAMAGES TO THE

03:13:40.408 --> 03:13:42.978
VICTIMS WHO THEY INJURED. BUT

03:13:43.044 --> 03:13:46.781
IN FACT THE OFFICERS PAY NOT

03:13:46.848 --> 03:13:49.351
ONE PENNY WHEN YOU ARE I ARE

03:13:49.417 --> 03:13:52.921
SUED FOR NEGLIGENCE- WE HAVE TO

03:13:52.988 --> 03:13:55.790
PAY THE DAMAGES BUT THEY DO NOT

03:13:55.857 --> 03:13:57.859
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED

03:13:57.926 --> 03:13:59.861
WITH THE MUNICIPALITIES. SO

03:13:59.928 --> 03:14:02.364
THAT THE MUNICIPALITIES PAY

03:14:02.430 --> 03:14:04.632
1100% OF THE COST OF POLICE

03:14:04.699 --> 03:14:09.371
MISCONDUCT. FINALLY I THINK ONE

03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:11.940
REASON THAT WE'VE HAD SO MUCH

03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:15.110
DIFFICULTY HOLDING OFFICERS

03:14:15.176 --> 03:14:19.914
ACCOUNTABLE IS THIS. WE FOCUS A

03:14:19.981 --> 03:14:23.284
LOT OF OUR ATTENTION. ON

03:14:23.351 --> 03:14:26.654
RESPONDING TO SHOOTINGS

03:14:26.721 --> 03:14:28.289
RESPONDING TO INJURIES

03:14:28.356 --> 03:14:31.226
RESPONDING TO A CUTE RECKLESS

03:14:31.292 --> 03:14:34.596
ACTS OF POLICING. BUT WE ARE

03:14:34.662 --> 03:14:37.632
MUCH LESS FOCUSED. I'M

03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:42.003
PREVENTING THESE ACTS FROM

03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:44.272
OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:14:44.339 --> 03:14:46.341
BY INTERVENING AT A MUCH

03:14:46.408 --> 03:14:48.743
EARLIER STAGE SO MY

03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:50.612
PRESENTATION IF YOU WANT TO

03:14:50.678 --> 03:14:52.881
THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ONE

03:14:52.947 --> 03:14:55.050
WORD IS PREVENTION. HOW DO WE

03:14:55.116 --> 03:14:58.219
PREVENT THE VIDEOS THAT ALL OF

03:14:58.286 --> 03:15:03.291
US HAVE SEEN. FROM RECURRING.

03:15:03.358 --> 03:15:05.193
WHEN I TALKED TO POLICE CHIEFS

03:15:05.260 --> 03:15:07.962
ABOUT THIS ISSUE HERE'S WHAT

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:12.033
THEY TELL ME. THEY SAY. DEBBIE

03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:14.002
I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE

03:15:14.069 --> 03:15:16.938
THE POLICE UNIONS ARE IN CHARGE.

03:15:17.005 --> 03:15:19.607
THEY SAY I CAN'T HIRE THE

03:15:19.674 --> 03:15:23.178
OFFICERS. I CAN'T PROMOTE THEM

03:15:23.244 --> 03:15:25.146
I CAN'T DISCIPLINE THEM AND I

03:15:25.213 --> 03:15:29.017
CAN'T FIRE THEM. SO I STOPPED

03:15:29.084 --> 03:15:30.552
PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS I DON'T

03:15:30.618 --> 03:15:34.222
UNDERSTAND. AND THEY SAID WE

03:15:34.289 --> 03:15:38.159
CAN'T HIRE. THE PEOPLE WE THINK

03:15:38.226 --> 03:15:39.394
WOULD BE GUARDIANS OF OUR

03:15:39.461 --> 03:15:41.996
COMMUNITY AND PROBLEM SOLVERS

03:15:42.063 --> 03:15:43.698
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HIRE THE

03:15:43.765 --> 03:15:45.667
PERSON WHO GOT THE HIGHEST

03:15:45.733 --> 03:15:48.837
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM TEST SCORE.

03:15:48.903 --> 03:15:51.506
WE CAN'T PROMOTE. THE PEOPLE

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:53.708
WHO DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF

03:15:53.775 --> 03:15:57.178
COMMUNITY POLICING. BECAUSE WE

03:15:57.245 --> 03:15:58.913
HAVE TO HIRE THE PERSON WHO GOT

03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:00.181
THE HIGHEST TEST ON THE CIVIL

03:16:00.248 --> 03:16:04.719
SERVICE EXAM. AND WE CANNOT

03:16:04.786 --> 03:16:07.822
DISCIPLINE THE OFFICERS WHO WE

03:16:07.889 --> 03:16:11.326
SEE WITH DRUG PROBLEMS ALCOHOL

03:16:11.392 --> 03:16:12.961
PROBLEMS ANGER MANAGEMENT

03:16:13.027 --> 03:16:14.395
PROBLEMS PEOPLE ENGAGING IN

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:16.030
RISKY BEHAVIOR PEOPLE WHO WERE

03:16:16.097 --> 03:16:17.765
ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING SOMEONE

03:16:17.832 --> 03:16:20.101
IN A BAR OR RESTITUTA BEING AND

03:16:20.168 --> 03:16:22.337
CONVICTED OF IT WE CAN'T

03:16:22.403 --> 03:16:26.808
DISCIPLINE THEM. BECAUSE OF THE

03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:29.677
LABOR ARBITRATION SYSTEM. WHAT

03:16:29.744 --> 03:16:31.479
THEY SAY IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:35.450
THE TIME. THEIR DECISION TO

03:16:35.517 --> 03:16:37.819
DISCIPLINE IS OVERTURNED. BY

03:16:37.886 --> 03:16:40.155
THE LABOR ARBITRATORS AND THAT

03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:43.057
THIS IS A SYSTEM CONTROLLED BY

03:16:43.124 --> 03:16:46.060
THE POLICE UNIONS AND FOR ALL

03:16:46.127 --> 03:16:47.362
OF THESE REASONS THEY ALSO

03:16:47.428 --> 03:16:51.099
CAN'T FIRE A POLICE OFFICER.

03:16:51.166 --> 03:16:53.535
NOW WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT

03:16:53.601 --> 03:16:56.571
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU TODAY.

03:16:56.638 --> 03:16:59.374
ONE QUOTE CAME TO MIND. IT'S

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:02.310
SHORT IT SAYS WE CAN'T SOLVE

03:17:02.377 --> 03:17:05.780
PROBLEMS. BY USING THE SAME

03:17:05.847 --> 03:17:08.416
KIND OF THINKING WE USED WHEN

03:17:08.483 --> 03:17:11.619
WE CREATED THEM. WE NEED NEW

03:17:11.686 --> 03:17:14.289
IDEAS WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT

03:17:14.355 --> 03:17:16.791
AGENCY TO DEVELOP A RISK

03:17:16.858 --> 03:17:18.126
ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

03:17:18.193 --> 03:17:22.630
SYSTEM. AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS.

03:17:22.697 --> 03:17:24.899
WHY CAN'T WE INSURE POLICE

03:17:24.966 --> 03:17:26.568
OFFICERS LIKE OTHER

03:17:26.634 --> 03:17:29.571
PROFESSIONALS AND REQUIRE THEM

03:17:29.637 --> 03:17:33.074
TO KERRY MANDATORY PROFESSIONAL

03:17:33.141 --> 03:17:36.611
LIABILITY INSURANCE. NOW MY

03:17:36.678 --> 03:17:38.813
NEIGHBOR IS A DOCTOR AND HE

03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:40.782
SAID HE HAS TO CARRY

03:17:40.848 --> 03:17:41.849
PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

03:17:41.916 --> 03:17:43.785
INSURANCE AND HE SAID IF I

03:17:43.851 --> 03:17:45.620
STARTED DRINKING OR USING DRUGS

03:17:45.687 --> 03:17:46.988
OPERATING ON THE WRONG LEG OR

03:17:47.055 --> 03:17:49.257
ARM MY INSURANCE PREMIUMS WOULD

03:17:49.324 --> 03:17:51.659
GO UP AND IF I CONTINUED TO DO

03:17:51.726 --> 03:17:54.395
THAT THEY DON'T WANT MORE AND I

03:17:54.462 --> 03:17:56.297
BE PRICED OUT OF MEDICINE. HE

03:17:56.364 --> 03:17:57.865
SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

03:17:57.932 --> 03:18:00.635
POLICE OFFICERS. WITH DANGEROUS

03:18:00.702 --> 03:18:02.837
HISTORIES AND INDICATORS ARE

03:18:02.904 --> 03:18:04.872
PRICED OUT OF POLICING THE SAME

03:18:04.939 --> 03:18:08.843
WAY. BY PREMIUMS THAT REFLECT

03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:12.013
THE ACTUAL RISK OF THEIR

03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:14.916
DANGEROUS POLICING. THE SYSTEM

03:18:14.983 --> 03:18:17.018
THAT I ENVISION WOULD BE A

03:18:17.085 --> 03:18:20.421
PREVENTION SYSTEM EARLY ON THE

03:18:20.488 --> 03:18:22.457
INSURANCE COMPANIES THROUGH

03:18:22.523 --> 03:18:24.259
RISK ASSESSMENT SCORE CARDS

03:18:24.325 --> 03:18:27.228
WOULD IDENTIFY OFFICERS ENGAGE

03:18:27.295 --> 03:18:30.131
IN RISKY BEHAVIOR. AND THEY

03:18:30.198 --> 03:18:32.500
WOULD SAY LOOK. YOU WERE JUST

03:18:32.567 --> 03:18:33.935
CONVICTED OF ASSAULTING SOMEONE

03:18:34.002 --> 03:18:34.802
AND BARK YOU WERE JUST

03:18:34.869 --> 03:18:36.104
CONVICTED OF DRUNK DRIVING YOU

03:18:36.170 --> 03:18:37.405

TRAINING. FOR YOUR PREMIUMS

03:18:43.544 --> 03:18:46.214
WILL GO UP IF YOU GET TREATMENT

03:18:46.281 --> 03:18:46.781
OR TRAINING YOUR PREMIUMS GO

03:18:46.848 --> 03:18:50.351
DOWN. IN THIS WAY WE WOULD

03:18:50.418 --> 03:18:51.986
CREATE AN ACCOUNTABILITY

03:18:52.053 --> 03:18:55.356
SYSTEM. THAT DEALT WITH SOME OF

03:18:55.423 --> 03:18:57.792
THESE ISSUES EARLIER. HOW WOULD

03:18:57.859 --> 03:19:02.530
IT WORK. WELL AN OFFICER WOULD

03:19:02.597 --> 03:19:03.798
HAVE TO CARRY PROFESSIONAL

03:19:03.865 --> 03:19:05.667
LIABILITY INSURANCE AND THAT'S

03:19:05.733 --> 03:19:07.268
WHERE YOU COME IN BECAUSE THE

03:19:07.335 --> 03:19:10.838
STATE LEGISLATURE COULD MANDATE.

03:19:10.905 --> 03:19:12.140
THAT IN ORDER TO POLICE IN

03:19:12.206 --> 03:19:14.375

03:19:20.915 --> 03:19:22.083
WOULD PAY THE AVERAGE BASE

03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:24.185
PREMIUM FOR ALL OFFICERS SO

03:19:24.252 --> 03:19:25.987
WOULD COST THE OFFICERS NOTHING

03:19:26.054 --> 03:19:27.789
BUT ANY INCREASES DUE TO RISKY

03:19:27.855 --> 03:19:29.991
BEHAVIOR ARE PAID BY THE

03:19:30.058 --> 03:19:33.461
OFFICER. AND THE MUNICIPALITIES

03:19:33.528 --> 03:19:36.164
WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PAYING

03:19:36.230 --> 03:19:36.664
FOR THE COST OF POLICE

03:19:36.731 --> 03:19:39.167
MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE PAID

03:19:39.233 --> 03:19:41.202
BY THE OFFICER AND THEIR

03:19:46.541 --> 03:19:48.443

03:19:56.484 --> 03:19:58.419
IDENTIFY WHAT EVERYONE ALREADY

03:19:58.486 --> 03:20:02.957
KNOWS WHO ARE THE BAD APPLES.

03:20:03.024 --> 03:20:04.892
THEY ARE AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

03:20:04.959 --> 03:20:08.796
THEY ASSIST RISK IN OTHER AREAS

03:20:08.863 --> 03:20:11.232
THEY PRICE OUT BAD DRIVERS THEY

03:20:11.299 --> 03:20:13.901
PRICE OUT BAD LAWYERS THEY

03:20:13.968 --> 03:20:15.770

SYSTEM HAD BEEN IN PLACE. LIVES

03:20:25.179 --> 03:20:28.082

03:20:30.051 --> 03:20:31.285
WHO STRANGLED ERIC GARDNER IN

03:20:31.352 --> 03:20:33.654

HAVE THIS SAME A SORT OF SYSTEM

03:23:06.107 --> 03:23:15.016
OR IS THIS A NOVEL OF CONCEPT.

03:23:15.082 --> 03:23:21.455
MISTER MERISTEMS YOUR QUESTION.

03:23:21.522 --> 03:23:24.825
IT IS IT IS A NOVEL A NEW IDEA

03:23:24.892 --> 03:23:25.526
BUT SINCE WE STARTED WRITING

03:23:25.593 --> 03:23:27.828
ABOUT THIS- SEVERAL THINGS HAVE

03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:29.664
HAPPENED FIRST ON COLORADO THEY

03:23:29.730 --> 03:23:32.833
ACTUALLY PASS STATE LEGISLATION.

03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:34.936
THAT MADE IT SO THAT THE

03:23:35.002 --> 03:23:39.106
OFFICER HAD TO PAY THE FIRST

03:23:39.173 --> 03:23:40.207
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

03:23:40.274 --> 03:23:42.376
DAMAGES PERSONALLY. MISSED A

03:23:42.443 --> 03:23:44.345
PENALTY WOULD ONLY PICK UP THE

03:23:44.412 --> 03:23:46.347
DAMAGES OVER TWENTY FIVE

03:23:46.414 --> 03:23:48.516
THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT MEANT

03:23:48.583 --> 03:23:50.618
THAT THE UNIONS CAME TO US AND

03:23:50.685 --> 03:23:53.187
SAID WE WANT TO PROFESSIONAL I

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:55.590

WITH ITS NEW PERSONAL LIABILITY

03:23:57.858 --> 03:24:00.995
THAT WE HAVE. SO IN CALIFORNIA

03:24:01.062 --> 03:24:02.930
THERE ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES

03:24:02.997 --> 03:24:05.366
PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT TWO

03:24:05.433 --> 03:24:07.401
OFFICERS BECAUSE THE STATE

03:24:07.468 --> 03:24:11.005
LEGISLATURE SAD WE ARE TIRED OF

03:24:11.072 --> 03:24:13.941
TAXPAYERS PAYING ONE HUNDRED

03:24:14.008 --> 03:24:16.377
PERCENT. OF THE COST OF POLICE

03:24:16.444 --> 03:24:17.979
MISCONDUCT BECAUSE IT COMES OUT

03:24:18.045 --> 03:24:19.313
OF THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET THAT

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:21.082
MEANS WE HAVE LESS FOR SCHOOLS

03:24:21.148 --> 03:24:22.083
AND AS YOU KNOW DURING A

03:24:22.149 --> 03:24:23.651
PANDEMIC AND DURING THE BUDGET

03:24:23.718 --> 03:24:25.286
CONSTRAINTS WE'RE GONNA FACE WE

03:24:25.353 --> 03:24:29.123
CAN NO LONGER PAY THAT BILL- IN

03:24:29.190 --> 03:24:30.591
THESE AS YOU KNOW THESE SUITS

03:24:30.658 --> 03:24:32.927
CAN BE TWENTY MILLION. FIVE

03:24:32.994 --> 03:24:33.995
MILLION FOUR MILLION THESE ARE

03:24:34.061 --> 03:24:35.496
HUGE SUITS THAT COME OUT OF

03:24:35.563 --> 03:24:39.433

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:41.535
THAT HAS ACTUALLY PASSED IT

03:24:41.602 --> 03:24:44.038

03:26:16.230 --> 03:26:16.797
THINK ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING

03:26:16.864 --> 03:26:18.799
TO LOOK AT. ON A POLICY LEVEL

03:26:18.866 --> 03:26:21.001
CHANGING THE- LIABILITY

03:26:21.068 --> 03:26:23.003
STANDARDS IN ANY WAY IT MAY

03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:24.572
EVEN BE A NECESSITY THAT WE

03:26:24.638 --> 03:26:26.574
NEED TO MOVE POLICE OFFICERS TO

03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:28.542
AN INSURANCE. BASED MODEL OR

03:26:28.609 --> 03:26:30.678
EVEN REQUIRE IT- OTHERWISE

03:26:30.745 --> 03:26:31.645
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYBODY

03:26:31.712 --> 03:26:33.647
WILLING TO JOIN THE PROFESSION

03:26:33.714 --> 03:26:35.082
I MEAN THAT'S YEAH ARE VERY

03:26:35.149 --> 03:26:36.717
VERY FEW PEOPLE WILLING TO JOIN

03:26:36.784 --> 03:26:37.985
THE PROFESSION. BECAUSE YOU

03:26:38.052 --> 03:26:39.787
DON'T WANT UNLIMITED LIABILITY

03:26:39.854 --> 03:26:40.988
AND SOMETIMES MULTIMILLION

03:26:41.055 --> 03:26:43.023
DOLLAR JUDGMENTS- WHEN YOU

03:26:43.090 --> 03:26:44.558
DON'T HAVE ASSETS OR RESOURCES

03:26:44.625 --> 03:26:46.427
TO PAY THOSE THAT'S NOT A VERY

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:48.763
VERY GOOD THING- MY QUESTION

03:26:48.829 --> 03:26:49.597
FOR YOU IS HAVE THERE BEEN

03:26:49.663 --> 03:26:53.000
STUDIES ABOUT. HOW THIS

03:26:53.067 --> 03:26:53.868
INSURANCE MARKET WOULD WORK-

03:26:53.934 --> 03:26:55.703
AND WHETHER INSURANCE CARRIERS

03:26:55.770 --> 03:26:57.638
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND-

03:26:57.705 --> 03:26:58.873
WRITING THOSE KINDS OF POLICIES

03:26:58.939 --> 03:26:59.940
AND WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH

03:27:00.007 --> 03:27:01.909
ACTUARIAL DATA OR WHATEVER DATA

03:27:01.976 --> 03:27:04.111
THEY NEED TO PROPERLY. ASSESS

03:27:04.178 --> 03:27:06.213
AND PRICE AND RISK GIVEN THIS

03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:08.549
IS KIND OF A NOVEL. CONCEPT IN

03:27:08.616 --> 03:27:10.050
THE YOU KNOW I'M AN ATTORNEY IN

03:27:10.117 --> 03:27:11.118
OUR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

03:27:11.185 --> 03:27:12.586
INSURANCE IS PRETTY WELL

03:27:12.653 --> 03:27:14.054
UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT

03:27:14.121 --> 03:27:15.523
FORMULAS FOR HOW MANY YEARS YOU

03:27:15.589 --> 03:27:16.724
PRACTICE TO WHAT KIND OF AREAS

03:27:16.791 --> 03:27:18.459
OF LAW YOU PRACTICE AND- YOU

03:27:18.526 --> 03:27:19.894
KNOW IF YOU DO FAMILY LAW IT'S

03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:20.961
ONE THING IF YOU DO THE STATE'S

03:27:21.028 --> 03:27:23.063
ENTRUSTS VERY VERY. EXPENSIVE

03:27:23.130 --> 03:27:24.265
IF YOU DO CRIMINAL DEFENSE

03:27:24.331 --> 03:27:26.367
IRONICALLY IT'S VERY CHEAP- BUT

03:27:26.433 --> 03:27:27.535
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY

03:27:27.601 --> 03:27:29.303
HAVE THAT BODY OF DATA-

03:27:29.370 --> 03:27:31.839
HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. SO I'M

03:27:31.906 --> 03:27:33.474
JUST CURIOUS PROFESSOR AS TO

03:27:33.541 --> 03:27:35.109
WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY

03:27:35.176 --> 03:27:37.578
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE- ON

03:27:37.645 --> 03:27:39.146
ON HOW THIS SORT OF NOVEL

03:27:39.213 --> 03:27:42.183
INSURANCE MARKET WOULD WORK

03:27:42.249 --> 03:27:42.750
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A VERY

03:27:42.817 --> 03:27:44.185
INTRIGUING IDEA. I WENT INTO

03:27:44.251 --> 03:27:46.086
LAW REVIEW I. THAT GO THROUGH

03:27:46.153 --> 03:27:47.688
THE DATA WORKING WITH INSURANCE

03:27:47.755 --> 03:27:49.290
PROFESSIONALS TO SET IT IT'S

03:27:49.356 --> 03:27:50.925
ACTUALLY A VERY LUCRATIVE MODEL

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:52.693
MODEL. IT'S VERY LUCRATIVE FOR

03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:55.095
INSURANCE COMPANIES- I'VE BEEN

03:27:55.162 --> 03:27:56.697
ADVISING STATES IS THAT MAYBE

03:27:56.764 --> 03:27:58.465
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN BE

03:27:58.532 --> 03:28:00.434
INVOLVED. IN THE RISK

03:28:00.501 --> 03:28:01.902
ASSESSMENT SCORECARDS BUT MAYBE

03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:03.671
THE STATE COULD DO SOME OF THE

03:28:03.737 --> 03:28:05.739
POOLING OF RESOURCES. WHAT I

03:28:05.806 --> 03:28:07.942
MEAN BY THAT IS THIS. IT ALL OF

03:28:08.008 --> 03:28:09.777
THESE POLICE DEPARTMENTS. ARE

03:28:09.844 --> 03:28:10.811
GOING TO BE PAYING THE BASE

03:28:10.878 --> 03:28:13.214
PREMIUM. COULD THAT ALL GO INTO

03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:15.082
A POOL THAT THE STATE INSURANCE

03:28:15.149 --> 03:28:18.018
COMPANY. SUPERVISES SO THEY

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:20.020
COULD GIVE REBATES TO THE-

03:28:20.087 --> 03:28:22.056
DEPARTMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN

03:28:22.122 --> 03:28:23.524
EXCELLENT AND HAVEN'T HAD ANY

03:28:23.591 --> 03:28:26.393
CLAIMS- AS OPPOSED TO THE

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:27.895
INSURANCE MARKET THAT EXISTS

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:29.897
WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES. MAKE

03:28:29.964 --> 03:28:32.566
A LOT OF MONEY ON THESE

03:28:32.633 --> 03:28:33.133
PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:35.236
INSURANCE. POLICIES BECAUSE

03:28:35.302 --> 03:28:37.905
EVERYONE HAS TO CARRY THEM. AND

03:28:37.972 --> 03:28:39.740
THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT FIGURING

03:28:39.807 --> 03:28:41.876
OUT HOW NOT TO PAY OUT. WHICH

03:28:41.942 --> 03:28:43.911
IS ONE REASON IT'S A GOOD MODEL

03:28:43.978 --> 03:28:46.280
THEY THEN BECOME THE WATCHDOG.

03:28:46.347 --> 03:28:48.249
THEY DON'T WANT A TWENTY

03:28:48.315 --> 03:28:49.617
MILLION DOLLAR VERDICT BECAUSE

03:28:49.683 --> 03:28:52.219
IF THEY GET IT THEY PAID. SO

03:28:52.286 --> 03:28:54.221
THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY VERY

03:28:54.288 --> 03:28:55.990
GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHO ARE

03:28:56.056 --> 03:28:58.125
THE OFFICERS ON THIS ROAD. AND

03:28:58.192 --> 03:29:01.428
STOPPING THEM BEFORE. SHOOTING

03:29:01.495 --> 03:29:04.598
A STRANGLING OR AN INCIDENT- IN

03:29:04.665 --> 03:29:06.433
TERMS OF THE INDICATORS.

03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:08.569
THERE'S A WHOLE WEALTH OF DATA

03:29:08.636 --> 03:29:10.337
ON WHAT THEY CALL EARLY WARNING

03:29:10.404 --> 03:29:12.740
INDICATORS OF MISCONDUCT. SOME

03:29:12.806 --> 03:29:14.241
OF THEM ARE THE FACT THAT MANY

03:29:14.308 --> 03:29:15.676
POLICE OFFICERS HAVE DOMESTIC

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:17.311
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS.

03:29:17.378 --> 03:29:18.412
AND THERE'S DEFINITELY

03:29:18.479 --> 03:29:20.581
EMPIRICAL DATA. THAT ONCE THAT

03:29:20.648 --> 03:29:21.715
HAPPENS THERE'S AN ANGER

03:29:21.782 --> 03:29:23.918
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. NOW WHAT

03:29:23.984 --> 03:29:25.619
SHOULD WE DO. WHAT WE DO NOW.

03:29:25.686 --> 03:29:27.988
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I DON'T

03:29:28.055 --> 03:29:29.223
CARE HOW LONG OR HOW MANY

03:29:29.290 --> 03:29:30.424
RESTRAINING ORDERS TO GET

03:29:30.491 --> 03:29:32.293
NOTHING HAPPENS. WHAT WOULD I

03:29:32.359 --> 03:29:34.561
LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. I'D LIKE TO

03:29:34.628 --> 03:29:36.497
SEE THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAY

03:29:36.563 --> 03:29:38.565
LOOK- YOU HAVE A DOMESTIC

03:29:38.632 --> 03:29:40.100
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER.

03:29:40.167 --> 03:29:43.637
THERE'S. CLEARLY ANGER

03:29:43.704 --> 03:29:44.605
MANAGEMENT ISSUES HERE- WOULD

03:29:44.672 --> 03:29:46.640
YOU CONSIDER HAVING ANGER

03:29:46.707 --> 03:29:48.909
MANAGEMENT TREATMENT IN AN

03:29:48.976 --> 03:29:51.545
EMPIRICALLY SOUND PROGRAM IF

03:29:51.612 --> 03:29:54.248
THEY SAY YES MAYBE WE CAN DEAL

03:29:54.315 --> 03:29:57.284
WITH IT IN THAT WAY WITHOUT IT

03:29:57.351 --> 03:29:59.453
ESCALATING OR CASCADING AND

03:29:59.520 --> 03:30:01.355
WITHOUT PRICING THE OFFICER OUT

03:30:01.422 --> 03:30:03.290
OF POLICING WHAT'S ANOTHER

03:30:03.357 --> 03:30:05.259
INDICATOR NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS

03:30:05.326 --> 03:30:07.428
OR JUDGMENTS MANY OF THE POLICE

03:30:07.494 --> 03:30:08.662
OFFICERS WHO HAVE YOU SEEN IN

03:30:08.729 --> 03:30:11.365
THOSE VIDEOS HAVE HAD MULTIPLE

03:30:11.432 --> 03:30:13.400
SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS WHAT

03:30:13.467 --> 03:30:18.439
DID WE DO. WHEN JASON VAN ****

03:30:18.505 --> 03:30:20.074
THE CITY CHICAGO PAID FIVE

03:30:20.140 --> 03:30:21.375
MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES

03:30:21.442 --> 03:30:24.645
BEFORE HE SHOT THE QUAN

03:30:24.712 --> 03:30:26.213
MCDONALD WHAT DID WE DO.

03:30:26.280 --> 03:30:27.381
NOTHING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

03:30:27.448 --> 03:30:29.883
DONE. SOME COUNSELING LOOK YOU

03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:31.852
JUST THE CITY CHICAGO JUST PAID

03:30:31.919 --> 03:30:33.287
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES

03:30:33.354 --> 03:30:35.289
FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE YOU

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:37.424
NEED. MAYBE YOU NEED TO BE

03:30:37.491 --> 03:30:38.759
PRICED OUT BECAUSE I THINK AT

03:30:38.826 --> 03:30:40.094
THAT POINT THE INSURANCE

03:30:40.160 --> 03:30:42.062
COMPANIES PATIENTS MIGHT BE

03:30:42.129 --> 03:30:44.431
VERY LOW- HE ALSO HAD A JURY

03:30:44.498 --> 03:30:47.267
AWARD 430-050-0004 EXCESSIVE

03:30:47.334 --> 03:30:49.303
USE OF FORCE IN A TRAFFIC STOP-

03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:51.438
THOSE ARE THE- INDICATORS

03:30:51.505 --> 03:30:53.140
THERE'S THE NUMBER OF CIVIL

03:30:53.207 --> 03:30:56.744
COMPLAINTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE

03:30:56.810 --> 03:30:59.513
PONTA LAYO WHO- CHOKED ERIC

03:30:59.580 --> 03:31:04.752
GARNER WAS IN THE TOP. 2% OF

03:31:04.818 --> 03:31:06.854
NEW YORK CITY OFFICERS FOR

03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:09.923
SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS WHAT DID

03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:13.260
WE DO. NOTHING AND AFTER HE

03:31:13.327 --> 03:31:15.262
STRANGLED ERIC GARNER TO DEATH

03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:17.097
ONE OF THE SYSTEM DO PUT HIM ON

03:31:17.164 --> 03:31:19.500
THE PAYROLL FOR FIVE YEARS

03:31:19.566 --> 03:31:21.835
BEFORE HE WAS FIRED. THAT'S THE

03:31:21.902 --> 03:31:24.738
SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW. WE COULD DO

03:31:24.805 --> 03:31:27.508
BETTER WE'VE DONE IT IN EVERY

03:31:27.574 --> 03:31:29.676
OTHER PROFESSIONAL ARENA. WE

03:31:29.743 --> 03:31:32.780
CAN SET UP CARROTS AND STICKS.

03:31:32.846 --> 03:31:34.615
I WAS THE ONE THING AND I DON'T

03:31:34.681 --> 03:31:35.249
WANT TO MONOPOLIZE THE

03:31:35.315 --> 03:31:37.251
CONVERSATION BUT I'VE GOT A LOT

03:31:37.317 --> 03:31:39.153
OF EMAILS FROM OFFICERS IN

03:31:39.219 --> 03:31:40.621
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID THIS WAS

03:31:40.687 --> 03:31:42.689
SURPRISING TO ME CHICAGO POLICE

03:31:42.756 --> 03:31:45.325
OFFICERS SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT

03:31:45.392 --> 03:31:49.430
ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM. WE ALL KNOW-

03:31:49.496 --> 03:31:51.598
THE OFFICERS ARE WHO ARE

03:31:51.665 --> 03:31:53.901
DRINKING WHO HAD DRUG PROBLEMS

03:31:53.967 --> 03:31:55.502
WHO'VE GOT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:31:55.569 --> 03:31:57.271
RESTRAINING ORDERS WHO ALREADY

03:31:57.337 --> 03:31:59.139
HAD JUDGMENTS AND WE SIT AND WE

03:31:59.206 --> 03:32:01.208
WATCH AND WE DO NOTHING AND WE

03:32:01.275 --> 03:32:03.243
THINK THAT'S LOYAL. WHAT I LIKE

03:32:03.310 --> 03:32:05.345
ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM. IS THAT YOU

03:32:05.412 --> 03:32:08.248
RECOGNIZE. A LOT OF THE ROOT

03:32:08.315 --> 03:32:11.485
CAUSE OF THIS IS POLICE TRAUMA.

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:14.588
WE ASK THEM TO GO WHERE WE

03:32:14.655 --> 03:32:17.024
WOULD NOT GO. AND DO WHAT WE

03:32:17.091 --> 03:32:19.126
WOULD NOT DO AND WHEN THEIR

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:20.861
TRAUMATIC TRAUMATIZING HAVE

03:32:20.928 --> 03:32:22.563
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS WE WATCH

03:32:22.629 --> 03:32:25.232
THEM DRINK. WE WATCH THEM TAKE

03:32:25.299 --> 03:32:28.168
DRUGS WE WATCH THEM LASH OUT AT

03:32:28.235 --> 03:32:30.370
THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR PARTNERS

03:32:30.437 --> 03:32:32.639
AND WE DO NOTHING HE SAID WHAT

03:32:32.706 --> 03:32:34.608
I LIKE ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM IS

03:32:34.675 --> 03:32:36.877
THAT YOU START WITH CARROTS AND

03:32:36.944 --> 03:32:39.146
GIVING TREATMENT. YOU GIVE THE

03:32:39.213 --> 03:32:40.280
PERSON A CHANCE AND YOU KNOW

03:32:40.347 --> 03:32:42.282
WHAT HE SAID AND IF THEY REFUSE

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:51.291
THE CHANCE. THEM WITH DIGNITY

03:32:51.358 --> 03:32:54.561
BY SAYING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

03:32:54.628 --> 03:32:57.131
AND WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

03:32:57.197 --> 03:33:00.334
TREATMENT FOR IT SO THE SYSTEM

03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:03.904
IS NOT JUST A PUNITIVE AFTER A

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:07.674
HORRIBLE EVENT OCCURS SYSTEM IT

03:33:07.741 --> 03:33:09.977
IS A CALIBRATED SYSTEM. WELL I

03:33:10.043 --> 03:33:11.378
WOULD ALSO ADD WHEN I ALSO LIKE

03:33:11.445 --> 03:33:12.779
ABOUT THE CONCEPT IS THAT

03:33:12.846 --> 03:33:14.314
YOU'RE SHIFTING THE COST FOR

03:33:14.381 --> 03:33:17.351
MISCONDUCT- TO PRIVATE THE

03:33:17.417 --> 03:33:19.253
PRIVATE MARKET AS OPPOSED TO

03:33:19.319 --> 03:33:20.621
SHIFTING IT TO THE TAXPAYER

03:33:20.687 --> 03:33:21.655
WHICH IS WHERE IT'S

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:23.657
PREDOMINATELY LIES NOW I'D BE

03:33:23.724 --> 03:33:24.625
INTERESTED IN READING YOUR LAW

03:33:24.691 --> 03:33:25.592
REVIEW ARTICLES IF YOU COULD

03:33:25.659 --> 03:33:26.827
MAYBE MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE TO

03:33:26.894 --> 03:33:28.328
THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR.

03:33:28.395 --> 03:33:29.763
WE WILL DEFINITELY SEND BOTH OF

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:30.597
THEM TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE

THEIR PATIENTS. FIND AN

03:35:11.965 --> 03:35:13.300
INSURANCE CARRIER WHO WILL

03:35:13.367 --> 03:35:15.535
ENSURE SOMEBODY WHOSE JOB IT IS

03:35:15.602 --> 03:35:18.038
TO ENGAGE IN HIGH SPEED CHASES

03:35:18.105 --> 03:35:20.007
USE FORCE TO ARREST VIOLENT.

OFFENDERS WELL THIS IS WHERE

03:35:23.076 --> 03:35:24.578
ALL CARRIERS DROP PUBLIC

ENTITIES YEARS AGO WHO NOW RELY

PICK THEIR CLIENTS POPS DON'T.

03:35:35.122 --> 03:35:36.990
DOCTORS ARE AFFORDED HOURS DAYS

03:35:37.057 --> 03:35:38.759

TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS IN

03:35:42.629 --> 03:35:43.664
SPLIT SECONDS AND I THINK IT'S

03:35:43.730 --> 03:35:46.433
AN UNFAIR COMPARISON AND I

03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:49.136
THINK IT'S ILLOGICAL AND UNFAIR.

03:35:49.202 --> 03:35:50.437

WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:36:05.285 --> 03:36:07.254
INSURANCE ISSUE AND I THINK

03:36:07.321 --> 03:36:09.456
IT'S A REALLY INTRIGUING ISSUE

03:36:09.523 --> 03:36:10.357
AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE

03:36:10.424 --> 03:36:12.626
GETTING. THE FOR CONFUSED ON

03:36:12.693 --> 03:36:14.628
THAT APPLICATION OF IT BECAUSE

03:36:14.695 --> 03:36:15.762
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE

03:36:15.829 --> 03:36:16.863
INSURANCE WOULD BE FOR THE

03:36:16.930 --> 03:36:18.965
FIRST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:36:19.032 --> 03:36:20.967
DOLLARS LIKE. YOU HAD IN

03:36:21.034 --> 03:36:23.003
COLORADO SO THE OFFICER WOULD

03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.970
ONLY BE ENSURING THAT NOT THE

03:36:24.037 --> 03:36:26.340
POTENTIAL TEN MILLION DOLLAR.

03:36:26.406 --> 03:36:27.908
WRONGFUL DEATH SETTLEMENT LIKE

THINK THAT IS THAT AND

03:36:36.516 --> 03:36:37.818
REASONABLE I DON'T THINK

03:36:37.884 --> 03:36:38.652
THERE'D BE THAT MUCH EXPOSURE

03:36:38.719 --> 03:36:40.687
WHERE. WE'RE CITIES WOULD BE

03:36:40.754 --> 03:36:42.022

FIRST PIECE TO THE OFFICER THE

03:36:45.025 --> 03:36:46.660
SECOND PIECE WHAT WOULD GO.

03:36:46.727 --> 03:36:48.562
THROUGH LIFE FOR EXPOSURE FOR

03:36:48.628 --> 03:36:49.796
THE CITY WHICH LEADS ME TO THE

03:36:49.863 --> 03:36:51.498
SECOND POINT THAT I KNOW.

03:36:51.565 --> 03:36:57.070
PROFESSOR CHEMERINSKY- HAD TO

03:36:57.137 --> 03:36:57.604

PRESENT WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:36:58.872 --> 03:37:00.374
DISCIPLINE BUT HE I'M I'M SURE

03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:01.108
HE WANTED TO BE ON THE

03:37:01.174 --> 03:37:02.876
LITIGATION SIDE BUT HE HAD TO

03:37:02.943 --> 03:37:05.045
GO BUT HE WAS WEAVING IN. A LOT

03:37:05.112 --> 03:37:07.447
OF COMMENTS ABOUT- EXPOSURE

03:37:07.514 --> 03:37:09.616
ESSENTIALLY. I'VE HEARD AND SAY

03:37:09.683 --> 03:37:12.919
THIS BEFORE AND I KNOW MISTER-GIPSON SERVED ON THE CITY

03:37:12.986 --> 03:37:13.987
COUNCIL SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD

03:37:14.054 --> 03:37:15.555
KNOW THIS. WHEN WE'RE IN CLOSED

03:37:15.622 --> 03:37:17.023
SESSION MANY TIMES WE TALK

03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:20.227
ABOUT LAWSUITS. EXCESSIVE FORCE

03:37:20.293 --> 03:37:21.661
YOU KNOW SOMEONE TRIPPING IN

03:37:21.728 --> 03:37:23.797
THE OLD SACRAMENTO- YOU KNOW

LOCHSIDE WALKEN'S THAT SETTLING

03:37:25.899 --> 03:37:27.267
FOR BROKEN ANKLE BUT A LOT OF

03:37:27.334 --> 03:37:29.202
TIMES IT WAS ABOUT PUBLIC

03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:30.637
SAFETY OF COURSE. AND YOU KNOW

03:37:30.704 --> 03:37:31.805
IN IN IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO

03:37:31.872 --> 03:37:34.141
LAST YEAR I THINK THAT- IT WAS

03:37:34.207 --> 03:37:36.476
THE NORTH NORTH OF TWENTY

03:37:36.543 --> 03:37:38.211
TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN. INS AND

03:37:38.278 --> 03:37:41.148
PAYOUTS FOR. EXCESSIVE FORCE

03:37:41.214 --> 03:37:43.049
WRONGFUL DEATH WHICH WHICH BY

03:37:43.116 --> 03:37:44.217
THE WAY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE

03:37:44.284 --> 03:37:45.185
MORE PUBLIC AND MORE

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:47.421
TRANSPARENT AS FAR AS HOW MUCH

03:37:47.487 --> 03:37:48.388
CITIES ARE PAYING AS WE SAID

03:37:48.455 --> 03:37:50.590
EARLIER. THOSE MONIES CAN BE GO

03:37:50.657 --> 03:37:51.725
DO ANOTHER BUNCH OTHER THINGS

03:37:51.792 --> 03:37:53.293
INCLUDING PREVENTION AS WE

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:54.528
HEARD FROM SOME OFFICERS IN

03:37:54.594 --> 03:37:56.630
TRAINING IN THE FIRST PLACE-

03:37:56.696 --> 03:37:58.331
BUT THE NOTION THAT THAT THAT

03:37:58.398 --> 03:38:00.767
DEAN- CHAMBER AND SKI PUTS

03:38:00.834 --> 03:38:02.936
FORWARD OVER AND OVER. HEADER

03:38:03.003 --> 03:38:05.806
HEARINGS IS THAT- A MORE A

03:38:05.872 --> 03:38:08.008
CIVIL EXPOSURE WOULD LEAD TO

03:38:08.074 --> 03:38:09.509
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AMONG

03:38:09.576 --> 03:38:11.244
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND I DON'T

03:38:11.311 --> 03:38:13.146
DISAGREE AND I THINK THAT LUCK.

03:38:13.213 --> 03:38:15.182
IF I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL.

03:38:15.248 --> 03:38:16.850
AND OUR BUDGET FOR WRONGFUL

03:38:16.917 --> 03:38:20.253
DEATH EXCESSIVE FORCE DOUBLED

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:21.588
ONE YEAR FROM TWENTY FIVE TO

03:38:21.655 --> 03:38:22.522
FIFTY MILLION. YOU BETTER

03:38:22.589 --> 03:38:24.090
BELIEVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL

03:38:24.157 --> 03:38:25.525
THE MAYOR WOULD BRING IN THE

03:38:25.592 --> 03:38:27.828
POLICE CHIEF. AND EVERYBODY IN

03:38:27.894 --> 03:38:29.329
THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT AND

03:38:29.396 --> 03:38:32.065
FOCUSING ON. ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:38:32.132 --> 03:38:33.834
RESULTS IN MAKING SURE THAT THE

03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:35.869
OFFICERS ACTIONS ARE REFLECTIVE

03:38:35.936 --> 03:38:37.971
OF OUR POLICIES BECAUSE- YOU

03:38:38.038 --> 03:38:39.339
DON'T FOLLOW THE MONEY AND

03:38:39.406 --> 03:38:40.173
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE

03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:42.442
INCENTIVE OF THAT SO. I DON'T

03:38:42.509 --> 03:38:43.844
THINK THAT THAT HE'S HE'S OFF

03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:45.579
ON THAT ISSUE. WHICH WHICH

03:38:45.645 --> 03:38:49.783
LEADS TO THE ISSUE OF THIS THAT

03:38:49.850 --> 03:38:50.484
THIS THE BANE ACT- AND I KNOW

03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:52.085
IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S

03:38:52.152 --> 03:38:54.621
BEEN. LOCKED IN AND AS FAR AS-

03:38:54.688 --> 03:38:56.890
DECERTIFICATION AND THE BANE

03:38:56.957 --> 03:38:58.391
ACT AND QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

03:38:58.458 --> 03:39:01.561
ISSUE. ON ONE ON ONE BILL. BUT

03:39:01.628 --> 03:39:03.129
BUT THE NOTION THERE I DON'T

03:39:03.196 --> 03:39:08.034
THINK IT IS A BAD ONE AND I'M

03:39:08.101 --> 03:39:10.370
PORAC AND OTHERS. SAY THAT IT

03:39:10.437 --> 03:39:13.139
WOULD CAUSE. OFFICERS TO LOSE

03:39:13.206 --> 03:39:16.142
THEIR HOMES AND EXPOSURE. AND

03:39:16.209 --> 03:39:18.044
IT WOULD IT WOULD YOU KNOW IF.

03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:19.112
WE WOULD HAVE ANYBODY APPLYING

03:39:19.179 --> 03:39:21.982
FOR THE JOB ANYMORE IF IT WAS

03:39:22.048 --> 03:39:23.116
FOCUSED ON THE NOTION THAT

03:39:23.183 --> 03:39:24.751
THERE WAS. LIKE A REASONABLE

03:39:24.818 --> 03:39:26.319
CAP I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD

03:39:26.386 --> 03:39:29.256
IDEA HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME

03:39:29.322 --> 03:39:29.890
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF

03:39:29.956 --> 03:39:31.391
SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEN. ON

03:39:31.458 --> 03:39:33.326
TOP OF THAT HIS EXPOSURE TO THE

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:35.428
JURISDICTION SO YOU KNOW THERE

03:39:35.495 --> 03:39:37.163
IS NOT MORE INDIVIDUAL

03:39:37.230 --> 03:39:39.633
LIABILITY FOR. FOR NECESSARILY

03:39:39.699 --> 03:39:41.401
OFFICER UNLESS THEY'RE

03:39:41.468 --> 03:39:43.603
COMMITTING A CRIME AND YOU KNOW

03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:45.472
YOU KNOW. DOING SOMETHING

03:39:45.539 --> 03:39:47.007
THAT'S WAY OUT OF THE SCOPE OF

03:39:47.073 --> 03:39:49.109
THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS THAT'S

03:39:49.175 --> 03:39:52.045
ANOTHER ISSUE- BUT BUT HAVING

03:39:52.112 --> 03:39:55.916
OVERALL- MORE ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:39:55.982 --> 03:39:56.750
AND EXPOSURE FOR THE

03:39:56.816 --> 03:39:57.984
JURISDICTION I THINK YOU'VE I

03:39:58.051 --> 03:39:59.653
THINK THAT WE BRING ABOUT. MUCH

03:39:59.719 --> 03:40:02.022
MUCH MORE REFORM SO- I'M NOT

03:40:02.088 --> 03:40:03.156
SURE MAYBE MUST RESPOND TO THAT

03:40:03.223 --> 03:40:05.225
BUT- BUT CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW

03:40:05.292 --> 03:40:07.127
THOSE I THINK. ARE ARE ARE WERE

03:40:07.193 --> 03:40:08.662
THE ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:40:08.728 --> 03:40:10.897
FOCUSING ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

03:40:10.964 --> 03:40:16.069
SO LET ME GO TO- MISTER SMITH-

03:40:16.136 --> 03:40:17.437
DOES ANYONE NEED A POUND ONE TO

03:40:17.504 --> 03:40:19.573
RESPOND TO THAT. QUESTION FOR

03:40:19.639 --> 03:40:24.244
MISS MCCARTY. OKAY WE HAVE A

03:40:24.311 --> 03:40:32.786
MISTER POINTER. ONE MOMENT

MICROPHONE ON. OKAY LET'S TRY

03:40:38.158 --> 03:40:39.292
IT OUT FRANKLY I THINK IS

03:40:39.359 --> 03:40:41.828
LUDICROUS AS OUR LAST ARGUMENT

03:40:41.895 --> 03:40:43.897
THAT- POLICE OFFICERS WOULD NOT

03:40:43.964 --> 03:40:45.899
SIGN UP FOR THE JOB OR THAT

03:40:45.966 --> 03:40:47.367
THEY'LL LOSE THEIR HOMES AS IT

03:40:47.434 --> 03:40:49.135
RELATES TO CIVIL LITIGATION

03:40:49.202 --> 03:40:50.337
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

03:40:50.403 --> 03:40:53.940
CASES. HAVE RECEIVED AND I HAVE

03:40:54.007 --> 03:40:55.308
BEEN A PART OF LITIGATION WHERE

03:40:55.375 --> 03:40:56.977
JURIES OF BRANDED MULTI MILLION

03:40:57.043 --> 03:40:59.412
DOLLAR VERDICTS POLICE OFFICERS

03:40:59.479 --> 03:41:01.815
HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK THOSE

03:41:01.881 --> 03:41:02.382
OFFICERS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

03:41:02.449 --> 03:41:05.418
PROMOTED. SO THE IDEA THAT IF

03:41:05.485 --> 03:41:06.653
WE WANT TO HOLD THEM

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:08.088
ACCOUNTABLE BY WAY OF CIVIL

03:41:08.154 --> 03:41:09.889
RIGHTS LITIGATION IS GOING TO

03:41:09.956 --> 03:41:10.991
LEAD TO IS NOT HAVING POLICE

03:41:11.057 --> 03:41:12.892
OFFICERS DISCOURAGING POLICE

03:41:12.959 --> 03:41:15.562
OFFICERS IS NOT BORNE OUT BY

03:41:15.629 --> 03:41:16.496
THE EVIDENCE AND BY MY

03:41:16.563 --> 03:41:18.665
EXPERIENCE ON TOP OF THE FACT

03:41:18.732 --> 03:41:19.799
WHAT I DO BELIEVE THE HOWEVER

03:41:19.866 --> 03:41:23.236
IS THAT. SIMILAR JUST LIKE

03:41:23.303 --> 03:41:23.937
EVERYDAY CITIZENS. WE'RE

03:41:24.004 --> 03:41:25.238
HITTING OUR PA. WE TEND TO

03:41:25.305 --> 03:41:27.607
CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR. OKAY IN

03:41:27.674 --> 03:41:28.875
THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THE

03:41:28.942 --> 03:41:30.510
MUNICIPALITIES WHETHER THAT'S

03:41:30.577 --> 03:41:31.878
THE POLICE CHIEF WHETHER THAT'S

03:41:31.945 --> 03:41:33.313
THE MAYOR WHEN THEY FILL IN THE

03:41:33.380 --> 03:41:35.882
BUDGET. THANKS TEND TO SHIFT

03:41:35.949 --> 03:41:37.484
AND WE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE

03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:39.252
CITY OF OAKLAND. WE'RE STARTING

03:41:39.319 --> 03:41:40.854
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN IN SAN

03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:43.056
FRANCISCO AND FRANKLY THAT'S

03:41:43.123 --> 03:41:44.124
WOODS WERE ON THE VERGE OF

03:41:44.190 --> 03:41:45.525
SEEING HOPEFULLY HAPPEN IN THE

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:47.794
CITY OF ALEPPO. SO I THINK THAT

03:41:47.861 --> 03:41:51.631
THAT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE-

03:41:51.698 --> 03:41:54.267
INCENTIVE TO HAVE OFFICERS

03:41:54.334 --> 03:41:55.935
CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT IT'S

03:41:56.002 --> 03:41:57.504
NOT ENOUGH ALONE THERE MUST BE

03:41:57.570 --> 03:42:00.473
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION THE

03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.041
CALENDAR WITH A GO WITH THE-

03:42:01.107 --> 03:42:03.410
THANK YOU. ADMINISTRATOR I'M

03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:04.377

SURE GOING TO ASK THAT THE-

03:42:06.813 --> 03:42:08.748
GENTLEMAN SO RIGHTS ATTORNEY.

03:42:08.815 --> 03:42:11.685
FROM POINTER IN. WELL NOT YES

YOU MENTIONED THE CITY OF

03:42:14.120 --> 03:42:16.556
VALLEJO AND- THAT- THAT

03:42:16.623 --> 03:42:19.059
DEPARTMENT IS A MASS A RACK

03:42:19.125 --> 03:42:21.394
THAT THE LOCAL DA HAS PUBLICLY

03:42:21.461 --> 03:42:25.398
SAID SO. ASKING FOR REFORM- THE

03:42:25.465 --> 03:42:27.567
ATTORNEY GENERAL STARTED ANY AN

03:42:27.634 --> 03:42:28.868
INVESTIGATION ON THEIR-

03:42:28.935 --> 03:42:30.136
BASICALLY THE CALIFORNIA

03:42:30.203 --> 03:42:31.237
VERSION OF THEIR PATTERN AND

03:42:31.304 --> 03:42:33.206
PRACTICE IS THERE. AND ONE

03:42:33.273 --> 03:42:34.607
THING THAT THAT'S KINDA LOST

03:42:34.674 --> 03:42:36.943
UPON ME IS THAT. HIGH PROFILE

03:42:37.010 --> 03:42:37.877
SHOOTING THEY HAD THEIR WITH

03:42:37.944 --> 03:42:39.679
THE OFFICER. IN THE BACK AND

03:42:39.746 --> 03:42:41.715
THAT KIND OF BANGLES THAT TO

03:42:41.781 --> 03:42:43.550
ROPE PICKUP TRUCK JUDGING THE

03:42:43.616 --> 03:42:44.551
ASSAULT RIFLE THROUGH THE

03:42:44.617 --> 03:42:48.321
BACKSEAT. AND THE OFFICERS-

03:42:48.388 --> 03:42:49.656
WENT AND THREW AWAY THE

03:42:49.723 --> 03:42:51.091
WINDSHIELD AND THE EVIDENCE

03:42:51.157 --> 03:42:53.326
WERE UNABLE TO DO THAT. SO ONE

03:42:53.393 --> 03:42:54.394
THING THAT TIME TO KIND OF DUMP

03:42:54.461 --> 03:42:55.995
BOUNCE ME AND- I KNOW SOME

03:42:56.062 --> 03:42:57.530
CITIES DO IT HERE IN

03:42:57.597 --> 03:42:59.532
SACRAMENTO. THEY JUST HAD A

03:42:59.599 --> 03:43:00.066
RECENT SHOOTING IN WEST

03:43:00.133 --> 03:43:02.268
SACRAMENTO AND WEST SAC HAS A

03:43:02.335 --> 03:43:04.037
POLICY THAT SAYS THAT CHRIS

03:43:04.104 --> 03:43:06.740
EVERT I Y. S. INCIDENTS. THEY

03:43:06.806 --> 03:43:07.907
WILL HAVE AN ADJACENT

03:43:07.974 --> 03:43:10.677
JURISDICTION BE THE LEAD. SO

03:43:10.744 --> 03:43:12.045
THEY I THINK IS DAVIS OR CITIES

03:43:12.112 --> 03:43:17.183
THAT COMES IN SO IT'S NOT LIKE.

03:43:17.250 --> 03:43:17.917
A WET SACK PEOPLE AREN'T. THERE

03:43:17.984 --> 03:43:19.185
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST WHEN.

03:43:19.252 --> 03:43:20.587
POLICE THEM. AND SO HAVING.

03:43:20.653 --> 03:43:23.156
ANOTHER OUTSIDE JURISDICTION

03:43:23.223 --> 03:43:24.424
GRANTED SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE

03:43:24.491 --> 03:43:26.226
STILL PLACE THEIR FROM TWENTY

03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:27.761
MILES OVER BUT- IT'S A LITTLE

03:43:27.827 --> 03:43:30.330
MORE TRANSPARENCY AND I WOULD

03:43:30.396 --> 03:43:31.765
THINK TRUST IF YOU HAVE ANY

03:43:31.831 --> 03:43:34.434
ADJACENT AGENCY. DOING THAT.

03:43:34.501 --> 03:43:36.402
VALLEJO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE

03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:38.304
THAT. I THINK THAT'S A FLY ON

03:43:38.371 --> 03:43:39.939
THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE

03:43:40.006 --> 03:43:41.875
SYSTEM WE SHOULD BE JUST THAT.

03:43:41.941 --> 03:43:43.576
BUT DO YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF

03:43:43.643 --> 03:43:44.511
WHERE THAT WORKS IN THAT BRINGS

03:43:44.577 --> 03:43:46.079
ABOUT MORE. TRUSTING THE

03:43:46.146 --> 03:43:50.483
PROCESS. SURE- AND I AND I AND

03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:51.885
I PRESUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:43:51.951 --> 03:43:53.553
THE INVESTIGATIONS THEMSELVES

03:43:53.620 --> 03:43:57.724
RIGHT SO- IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR

03:43:57.791 --> 03:44:00.059
EXAMPLE- THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

03:44:00.126 --> 03:44:01.661
OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY

03:44:01.728 --> 03:44:03.663
ACTUALLY INVESTIGATES OFFICER

03:44:03.730 --> 03:44:04.864
INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND ANY

03:44:04.931 --> 03:44:07.300
COMPLAINTS THAT ARE FILED OUT

03:44:07.367 --> 03:44:08.868
OF THE OFFICERS. ACTED

03:44:08.935 --> 03:44:10.703
ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE

03:44:10.770 --> 03:44:12.372
OR BE USING THEIR AUTHORITY

03:44:12.438 --> 03:44:14.140
THAT IS INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT

03:44:14.207 --> 03:44:16.476
IS NOT THAT A CIVILIAN LED AND

03:44:16.543 --> 03:44:18.945
IS NOT- THE GOVERNOR IF YOU

03:44:19.012 --> 03:44:20.180
WILL BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

03:44:20.246 --> 03:44:21.347
ITSELF NOW IT'S STILL WITHIN

03:44:21.414 --> 03:44:22.816
THEIR JURISDICTIONS BUT IT'S AN

03:44:22.882 --> 03:44:24.484
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND

03:44:24.551 --> 03:44:26.486
PROP MOST IMPORTANTLY. THEIR

03:44:26.553 --> 03:44:28.054
INVESTIGATION BEGINS AT THE

03:44:28.121 --> 03:44:30.089
SAME TIME SO THEY'RE NOT RUBBER

03:44:30.156 --> 03:44:32.892
STAMPING ANOTHER JURISDICTION

03:44:32.959 --> 03:44:33.560
OR THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT'S

03:44:33.626 --> 03:44:35.995
INVESTIGATION. ESSENTIALLY THE

03:44:36.062 --> 03:44:38.698
FOUNDATION IS MADE RIGHT THERE

03:44:38.765 --> 03:44:39.566
ON THE SPOT AND THEY'RE A PART

03:44:39.632 --> 03:44:41.768
OF IT VERSES. REVIEWING AN

03:44:41.835 --> 03:44:43.269
INVESTIGATION WHEN OFFICERS OF

03:44:43.336 --> 03:44:44.504
ALREADY BEEN COUNSELED FOR

03:44:44.571 --> 03:44:44.971
THEY'VE ALREADY GIVEN

03:44:45.038 --> 03:44:46.272
STATEMENTS AND YOU'RE REALLY

03:44:46.339 --> 03:44:47.373
JUST SIFTING THROUGH WHAT

03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:49.008
SOMEONE ELSE HAS ALREADY DONE

03:44:49.075 --> 03:44:50.043
THE CAKE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE

03:44:50.109 --> 03:44:51.744
AT THAT POINT SO I THINK THAT'S

03:44:51.811 --> 03:44:53.246
A VERY IMPORTANT MODEL AND I

03:44:53.313 --> 03:44:54.147
THINK THAT THAT COULD BE

03:44:54.214 --> 03:44:55.815
REPLICATED AROUND THE STATE. IN

03:44:55.882 --> 03:44:57.417
PARTICULAR I KNOW THAT MISTER

03:44:57.483 --> 03:44:58.618
HENDERSON WAS HERE EARLIER

03:44:58.685 --> 03:45:00.186
SPEAKING SHOWS THAT MODEL IN

03:45:00.253 --> 03:45:02.388
THE WAY IN WHICH IT SHOULD BE

03:45:02.455 --> 03:45:04.757
REPLICATED IN FACT- THAT THAT

03:45:04.824 --> 03:45:06.292
SHOULD BE A STATE MODEL FOR THE

03:45:06.359 --> 03:45:07.827
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK

03:45:07.894 --> 03:45:09.095
THAT GIVEN HIS EXPERIENCE

03:45:09.162 --> 03:45:10.296
PROBABLY THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO

03:45:10.363 --> 03:45:12.432
THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND

03:45:12.498 --> 03:45:13.233
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TAKE

03:45:13.299 --> 03:45:14.133
PLACE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST

03:45:14.200 --> 03:45:15.835
A INHERENT CONFLICT. WHEN YOU

03:45:15.902 --> 03:45:18.571
HAVE OFFICERS INVESTIGATING

03:45:18.638 --> 03:45:20.740
THEIR BODIES THEIR COWORKERS

03:45:20.807 --> 03:45:22.475
THEIR FRIENDS WHEN SO MUCH IS

03:45:22.542 --> 03:45:24.444
HANGING IN THE BALANCE IS VERY

03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:26.846
IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST.

03:45:26.913 --> 03:45:29.148
FOR OUR COMMITMENT TO

03:45:29.215 --> 03:45:31.551
TRANSPARENCY THAT THERE'S AN

03:45:31.618 --> 03:45:32.952
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO

03:45:33.019 --> 03:45:36.322
THESE INCIDENTS OF THIS POLICE

03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:39.459
MISCONDUCT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THEN WE WILL GO TO MISTER.

03:45:49.135 --> 03:45:51.638
DAVID E. THE STACK ME

03:45:51.704 --> 03:45:54.307

03:45:54.374 --> 03:45:59.145
BAT. YOU MISTER CHAIR- THIS

03:45:59.212 --> 03:46:01.414
THIS CONCEPT TO PROVIDED BY A

03:46:01.481 --> 03:46:04.150
PROFESSOR EMERITUS I THINK IS

03:46:04.217 --> 03:46:05.551
WONDERFUL I CAN TELL BY THE

03:46:05.618 --> 03:46:06.753
QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS FROM

03:46:06.819 --> 03:46:07.787
MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS

03:46:07.854 --> 03:46:09.622
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE

03:46:09.689 --> 03:46:12.492
EXPLORING. IT IT APPEARS THAT

03:46:12.558 --> 03:46:13.793
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO

03:46:13.860 --> 03:46:16.396
REGAIN THE TRUST YEAH AND IT'S

03:46:16.462 --> 03:46:17.931
THE TRUST OF OUR POLICE

03:46:17.997 --> 03:46:19.132
DEPARTMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY

03:46:19.198 --> 03:46:20.333
THAT THEY'RE SERVING IN THE

03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:22.135
COMMUNITY THAT'S BEING SERVED

03:46:22.201 --> 03:46:25.171
GREATER TRUST IN THE POLICE.

03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:25.838
DEPARTMENT OF THE POLICE

03:46:25.905 --> 03:46:27.907
OFFICERS THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT

03:46:27.974 --> 03:46:30.009
ARE PROTECTING THEM AND ONE OF

03:46:30.076 --> 03:46:32.211
THE IMPORTANT THINGS IT'S A

03:46:32.278 --> 03:46:34.380
IT'S EVIDENT HERE IS THAT BOTH

03:46:34.447 --> 03:46:35.782
THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE

03:46:35.848 --> 03:46:40.053
COMMUNITY WANT TO BE READ OF

03:46:40.119 --> 03:46:43.523
THE BAD. OFFICERS I THINK IF WE

03:46:43.589 --> 03:46:46.059
AS WE PROVIDE THIS PROTECTION

03:46:46.125 --> 03:46:48.995
TO THE PUBLIC. FIGURING OUT A

03:46:49.062 --> 03:46:50.596
WAY THAT WE PROTECT OUR

03:46:50.663 --> 03:46:54.300
MUNICIPALITIES- IT. IS

03:46:54.367 --> 03:46:56.135
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN

03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:58.638
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS WE LOOK

03:46:58.705 --> 03:47:02.041
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BUT THIS

03:47:02.108 --> 03:47:05.378
INSURANCE POLICY BECOMES A

03:47:05.445 --> 03:47:08.281
SECONDARY EVALUATION OR

03:47:08.348 --> 03:47:10.450
SECONDARY INVESTIGATION OF OUR

03:47:10.516 --> 03:47:13.119
POLICE OFFICERS. AND I THINK

03:47:13.186 --> 03:47:15.188
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF BECOME

03:47:15.254 --> 03:47:17.223
SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

03:47:17.290 --> 03:47:19.192
BECAUSE WE HAVE WE TALKED

03:47:19.258 --> 03:47:23.062
EARLIER ABOUT CIVILIAN-

03:47:23.129 --> 03:47:24.731
COMMITTEES THAT DO THAT TO

03:47:24.797 --> 03:47:25.999
PARTICIPATE IN THE IT

03:47:26.065 --> 03:47:30.169
INVESTIGATIONS BUT THIS BECOMES.

03:47:30.236 --> 03:47:34.407
IT'S VERY VERY OBJECTIVE AND IF

03:47:34.474 --> 03:47:36.376
YOU DON'T IF YOU ARE REQUIRED

03:47:36.442 --> 03:47:38.778
TO HAVE LIABILITY COVERAGE TO

03:47:38.845 --> 03:47:40.346
HOLD THE POSITION THE

03:47:40.413 --> 03:47:42.682
PROFESSIONAL POSITION OF POLICE

03:47:42.749 --> 03:47:44.650
OFFICER AND THERE IS NO

03:47:44.717 --> 03:47:46.152
INSURANCE COMPANY WILLING TO

03:47:46.219 --> 03:47:47.887
PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. YOU CAN'T

03:47:47.954 --> 03:47:50.423
GET THE JOB. AND THAT'S THE END

03:47:50.490 --> 03:47:53.092
OF IT AND IT RATHER THAN HAVING

03:47:53.159 --> 03:47:55.261
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE

03:47:55.328 --> 03:47:58.531
CHIEFS- AND TO THE UNION TRYING

03:47:58.598 --> 03:48:00.333
TO FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT TO DO.

03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:02.235
IF THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU

03:48:02.301 --> 03:48:03.669
HAVE TO HAVE LIABILITY

03:48:03.736 --> 03:48:05.772
INSURANCE THAT'S A REQUIREMENT

03:48:05.838 --> 03:48:07.306
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET IT THERE

03:48:07.373 --> 03:48:08.908
HAS TO BE A REASON. WOULD BE

03:48:08.975 --> 03:48:11.577
DUE PROCESS SO THAT IF IT'S

03:48:11.644 --> 03:48:12.879
DENIED THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

03:48:12.945 --> 03:48:15.214
TO- APPEAL THAT. IT'S BASED ON

03:48:15.281 --> 03:48:17.717
A DECISION OR A RECORD IN IN

03:48:17.784 --> 03:48:20.286

TO HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX THAT

03:48:21.954 --> 03:48:23.990
WELL I THINK THAT IN THE END

03:48:24.057 --> 03:48:27.493
THAT BECOMES A WIN WIN. FOR ALL

03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:28.995

DEFENSIVE OF IT HAVING TO TURN

03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:37.170

THE PREMIUMS WERE

03:49:33.226 --> 03:49:35.328

TRIBUNAL YOU THEN GO TO- THE

03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:09.896

TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

03:50:25.378 --> 03:50:27.780
INSURANCE DEPARTMENT- IN

03:50:27.847 --> 03:50:30.616
ASSESSING THE- INSURANCE

03:50:30.683 --> 03:50:32.718
COMPANIES DECISION BUT NONE THE

03:50:32.785 --> 03:50:34.187
LESS LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING

03:50:34.253 --> 03:50:35.388
IS THERE REASONABLE BASIS WHAT

03:50:35.454 --> 03:50:37.523
WAS THE EVIDENCE- WAS THE

03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:38.958
EVIDENCE. OBJECTIVE OR

03:50:39.025 --> 03:50:41.961
SUBJECTIVE- IS IT THE KIND OF

03:50:42.028 --> 03:50:43.563
THING THAT A REASONABLE PERSON

03:50:43.629 --> 03:50:45.965
CAN RELY UPON- AND THINGS OF

03:50:46.032 --> 03:50:48.000
THAT NATURE- AND THAT HAS

03:50:48.067 --> 03:50:50.002
WORKED IN THE DRIVING CONTEXT

03:50:50.069 --> 03:50:50.770
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE TRUCK

03:50:56.509 --> 03:50:58.811
PREMIUMS WERE BEING SET SO HIGH

03:50:58.878 --> 03:50:59.412
THAT THEY WERE PRICED OUT OF

03:50:59.478 --> 03:51:01.447
TRUCK DRIVING. AND THE UNION

03:51:01.514 --> 03:51:02.782
SAID WE CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT

03:51:02.848 --> 03:51:04.383
THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC

03:51:04.450 --> 03:51:07.220
POLICY IS ON INDEPENDENT

03:51:07.286 --> 03:51:08.888
TERMINATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT

03:51:08.955 --> 03:51:12.391
ON THE ROADS. AND ARM SO IT

03:51:12.458 --> 03:51:14.260
DOESN'T IMPLICATE THE UNION AND

03:51:14.327 --> 03:51:15.328
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

03:51:15.394 --> 03:51:16.629
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND THEN

03:51:16.696 --> 03:51:17.964
THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS

03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:20.132
AND IF AFTER THAT- THERE'S A

03:51:20.199 --> 03:51:22.134
DETERMINATION OBVIOUSLY EVEN

03:51:22.201 --> 03:51:24.337
AFTER. THE JUDICIAL PROCESS YOU

03:51:24.403 --> 03:51:25.771
COULD APPEAL TO THE APPELLATE

03:51:25.838 --> 03:51:27.406
COURT FOR AN APPELLATE DECISION

03:51:27.473 --> 03:51:29.408

03:51:54.667 --> 03:51:58.904
NOVEL- CONCEPT OF. A

03:51:58.971 --> 03:51:59.739
PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

03:51:59.805 --> 03:52:02.808

FAVOR OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

03:52:20.359 --> 03:52:23.329
THINKING I THINK THAT THIS IDEA

03:52:23.396 --> 03:52:26.766
IS ILL ADVISED AND FATALLY

03:52:26.832 --> 03:52:30.236
FLAWED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

03:52:30.303 --> 03:52:32.538
STARTING WITH THAT CALIFORNIA

03:52:32.605 --> 03:52:35.541

HAVE MERIT BASED HIRING NOT

03:52:41.580 --> 03:52:43.349
CRONYISM HAS BEEN FOR OVER A

HUNDRED YEARS AND THAT YOU HAVE

DISCRIMINATION. AND OPEN PUBLIC

EMPLOYMENTS TO EVERYONE AND

03:52:51.624 --> 03:52:53.626
ANOTHER CALIFORNIA VALUE AND

03:52:53.693 --> 03:52:55.728
THIS IS BETTER RECOGNIZED BY

03:52:55.795 --> 03:52:57.196
THE COURTS AND IN A NUMBER OF

03:52:57.263 --> 03:52:59.598
STATUTES IS THAT EMPLOYEES

03:52:59.665 --> 03:53:00.833
SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED BY THEIR

03:53:00.900 --> 03:53:03.336
EMPLOYERS. BOTH IN THE PRIVATE

03:53:03.402 --> 03:53:05.504
SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND

03:53:05.571 --> 03:53:07.907
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND

03:53:07.973 --> 03:53:09.575
RECEIVE A DEFENSE AND IF YOU

03:53:09.642 --> 03:53:12.144
LOOK AT LABOR CODE TWENTY EIGHT

03:53:12.211 --> 03:53:13.179
OH TWO THERE IS A GENERAL RIGHT

03:53:13.245 --> 03:53:15.147
OF INDEMNITY THAT APPLIES TO

03:53:15.214 --> 03:53:17.116
ALL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA.

03:53:17.183 --> 03:53:17.883
THERE ARE GOVERNMENT CODE

03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:19.385
SECTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO

03:53:19.452 --> 03:53:21.554
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT REFINED

03:53:21.620 --> 03:53:27.393
THOSE. VAN NUYS IN DEAL WITH.

03:53:27.460 --> 03:53:29.128
THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NINE

03:53:29.195 --> 03:53:31.197
NINE FIVE AND EIGHT TWENTY FIVE

03:53:31.263 --> 03:53:32.164
THEY DEAL WITH THE RIGHT TO BE

03:53:32.231 --> 03:53:33.866
DEFENDED AND INDEMNIFIED AND

03:53:33.933 --> 03:53:35.234
THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FROM A

03:53:35.301 --> 03:53:37.103
PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT

03:53:37.169 --> 03:53:39.572
BECAUSE- YOU HAVE TO ALSO THINK

03:53:39.638 --> 03:53:40.773
ABOUT THE SITUATIONS IN

03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:42.341
CALIFORNIA WHERE ANY CRITICAL

03:53:42.408 --> 03:53:43.442
INCIDENT AN OFFICER IS GOING TO

03:53:43.509 --> 03:53:45.144
GET SUED THAT'S JUST THE FACT

03:53:45.211 --> 03:53:46.679
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

03:53:46.746 --> 03:53:47.913
THE OFFICER'S ACTIONS WERE

03:53:47.980 --> 03:53:49.715
JUSTIFIED OR APPROPRIATE. AND

03:53:49.782 --> 03:53:51.016
BECAUSE OF JOINT AND SEVERAL

03:53:51.083 --> 03:53:53.052
LIABILITY THE PUBLIC ENTITY IS

03:53:53.119 --> 03:53:54.653
THE DEEP POCKETS AND THE PUBLIC

03:53:54.720 --> 03:53:57.156
ENTITY IS THE ONE THAT THE

03:53:57.223 --> 03:53:57.790
PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS ARE GOING TO

03:53:57.857 --> 03:53:59.759
BE. I MERRILY SEEKING

03:53:59.825 --> 03:54:02.395
COMPENSATION FROM AND SO IF YOU

03:54:02.461 --> 03:54:04.663
CREATE A SPLIT WHERE. A PUBLIC

03:54:04.730 --> 03:54:06.165
EMPLOYER MIGHT FOR A GOOD

03:54:06.232 --> 03:54:08.167
ECONOMIC REASONS DECIDE HEY I

03:54:08.234 --> 03:54:09.802
CAN SETTLE THIS CASE FOR TEN

03:54:09.869 --> 03:54:10.369
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S

03:54:10.436 --> 03:54:11.737
CHEAPER THAN TRYING IT EVEN

03:54:11.804 --> 03:54:12.972
THOUGH WE WOULD WIN IT WOULD

03:54:13.038 --> 03:54:14.774
COST US FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

03:54:14.840 --> 03:54:16.542
WELL IF THE OFFICER IS GOING TO

03:54:16.609 --> 03:54:17.676
HAVE TO YOU KNOW THESE ARE

03:54:17.743 --> 03:54:19.779
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN MAKING

03:54:19.845 --> 03:54:20.379
FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

03:54:20.446 --> 03:54:21.881
YEAR. GO OUT OF POCKET FOR THAT

03:54:21.947 --> 03:54:23.215
EXPENSE THEY'RE GONNA REFUSE TO

03:54:23.282 --> 03:54:24.884
SETTLE THE CASE. AND FORCE

03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:27.353
CASES TO TRIAL AND SO I THINK

03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:29.355
THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES-

03:54:29.422 --> 03:54:31.023
NEED TO BE CONSIDERED I'M SURE

03:54:31.090 --> 03:54:32.958
MR TOUCHSTONE HAS. MORE

03:54:33.025 --> 03:54:34.527
INSIGHTS ON THAT BUT I WANT TO

03:54:34.593 --> 03:54:36.195
HIT A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS

03:54:36.262 --> 03:54:37.730
THAT I THINK THERE. ARE

03:54:37.797 --> 03:54:39.999
CRITICALLY MISSING. NUMBER ONE

03:54:40.065 --> 03:54:41.967
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

03:54:42.034 --> 03:54:43.936
ANALOGOUS TO PRIVATE SECTOR.

03:54:44.003 --> 03:54:46.005
PROFESSIONS THERE ARE SOME

03:54:46.071 --> 03:54:48.240
PUBLIC SECTOR PROFESSIONS YOU

03:54:48.307 --> 03:54:49.175
KNOW YOU HAVE DOCTORS AND I

03:54:49.241 --> 03:54:50.443
REPRESENT A LOT OF PUBLIC

03:54:50.509 --> 03:54:51.677
ATTORNEYS AND THEIR PRIVATE

03:54:51.744 --> 03:54:52.511
SECTOR ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC

03:54:52.578 --> 03:54:53.913
SECTOR ATTORNEYS BUT LAW

03:54:53.979 --> 03:54:55.614
ENFORCEMENT IS UNIQUE. WE ASK

03:54:55.681 --> 03:54:57.116
THESE MEN AND WOMEN TO RUN

03:54:57.183 --> 03:54:58.184
TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE

03:54:58.250 --> 03:55:00.319
GUNFIRE. TO PROTECT US AND IF

03:55:00.386 --> 03:55:02.054
YOU LOOK AT PROFESSOR REMEMBERS

03:55:02.121 --> 03:55:04.256
HIS PROPOSALS. OR REALLY ANY

03:55:04.323 --> 03:55:05.991
KIND OF INSURANCE RACKS WORRY

03:55:06.058 --> 03:55:08.127
ILL ASSESSMENT. IT'S NOT MERIT

03:55:08.194 --> 03:55:09.995
BASED THESE CASES ARE TOO

03:55:10.062 --> 03:55:12.031
SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE THAT YOU

03:55:12.097 --> 03:55:13.833
LOOK AT STATISTICAL MODELS.

03:55:13.899 --> 03:55:15.034
THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:16.435
USED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

03:55:16.502 --> 03:55:18.537
PEOPLE IN TERMS OF LENDING

03:55:18.604 --> 03:55:20.773
HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND IF

03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:22.374
THEY LOOK AT THINGS. YOU'RE

03:55:22.441 --> 03:55:23.742
COURTING TO MRS AMERICA

03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:26.312
PROFESSOR MARISS. PAPERS IT'S

SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES. WE

03:57:05.778 --> 03:57:08.681
HAVE A HOME RULE HERE WHICH

UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROPOSAL

03:57:16.021 --> 03:57:18.157
WOULD BE. THAT LOCAL ENTITIES

03:57:18.223 --> 03:57:20.259
WOULD BE MANDATED TO ENSURE A

03:57:20.326 --> 03:57:22.127
BASE LEVEL OF INSURANCE WHICH

03:57:22.194 --> 03:57:23.696
IS AN INTERFERENCE IN MUNICIPAL

03:57:23.762 --> 03:57:25.364
AFFAIRS BECAUSE MANY AGENCIES

03:57:25.431 --> 03:57:27.399
CHOOSE TO SELF INSURE. AND THEN

03:57:27.466 --> 03:57:29.168

COST OF. THE INDEMNIFICATION

03:57:36.075 --> 03:57:37.977
AND SO THE EFFECT WOULD BE WE

03:57:38.043 --> 03:57:39.445
WOULD BE SINGLING OUT A

03:57:39.511 --> 03:57:41.447

LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT

03:57:50.222 --> 03:57:53.192
US. AND WE WOULD BE CREATING

03:57:53.258 --> 03:57:55.327
THESE INCENTIVES THAT I THINK

03:57:55.394 --> 03:57:58.464
ARE. CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY

03:57:58.530 --> 03:58:00.866
WHEN YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW AS

03:58:00.933 --> 03:58:02.201

LAWYERS THEY HAVE TIME. AND

03:58:06.572 --> 03:58:08.540
THEY HAVE TRANQUILITY TO MAKE

03:58:08.607 --> 03:58:10.809
JUDGMENTS THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE

03:58:10.876 --> 03:58:12.478
TO BUY INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE

03:58:12.544 --> 03:58:14.013
THAT'S A MISNOMER UNLESS YOU'RE

03:58:14.079 --> 03:58:16.081
A SOLO PRACTITIONER. EVERY TURN

AT MY OFFICE IS INSURED BY THE

03:58:18.517 --> 03:58:20.486
BUSINESS FOR THEIR MALPRACTICE

03:58:20.552 --> 03:58:21.587
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MEDICAL

GROUPS PUBLIC ATTORNEY'S.

03:58:25.924 --> 03:58:28.861
PUBLIC DOCTORS. AND SO. FROM

03:58:28.927 --> 03:58:30.162
JUST A FUNDAMENTAL POLICY

03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:33.265
STANDPOINT I BELIEVE STRONGLY

03:58:33.332 --> 03:58:35.300
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT IN

03:58:35.367 --> 03:58:38.871
PLACE. INCENTIVES THAT MAKE

03:58:38.937 --> 03:58:41.106
AGENCIES AND OFFICERS NOT ONE

03:58:41.173 --> 03:58:42.007
TO RUN TO THE SOUND OF THE

03:58:42.074 --> 03:58:43.976
GUNFIRE NOT WANT TO GIVE US

03:58:44.043 --> 03:58:46.412
PROTECTION AND ONE FINAL POINT

03:58:46.478 --> 03:58:49.615
IS THE SUPREME COURT AND THIS

03:58:49.682 --> 03:58:52.651
BODY RECOGNIZED THAT BECAUSE-

03:58:52.718 --> 03:58:54.720
EVERY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE

03:58:54.787 --> 03:58:55.220
WITH THE STATUTE CALLED

03:58:55.287 --> 03:58:57.690
MICROSOFT THAT WE WERE GOING TO

03:58:57.756 --> 03:59:00.292
PRICE DOCTORS OUT OF THE MARKET

03:59:00.359 --> 03:59:01.794
WITH MALPRACTICE INSURANCE IN

03:59:01.860 --> 03:59:03.762
CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE STATE

03:59:03.829 --> 03:59:05.764
IMPOSED A HARD CAP OF TWO

03:59:05.831 --> 03:59:07.032
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

03:59:07.099 --> 03:59:10.636
DOLLARS IN LIABILITY ON DOCTORS

03:59:10.703 --> 03:59:12.104
IN ORDER TO STABILIZE. THE

03:59:12.171 --> 03:59:14.206
INSURANCE MARKET SO THAT YOU

03:59:14.273 --> 03:59:16.341
DON'T HAVE A FLIGHT OF DOCTORS

03:59:16.408 --> 03:59:17.176
FROM THE STATE AND I WOULD

03:59:17.242 --> 03:59:20.145
SUBMIT. TO THIS BODY THAT THERE

03:59:20.212 --> 03:59:22.481
IS A VERY REAL RISK WE ALREADY

03:59:22.548 --> 03:59:23.749
HAVE A SHORTAGE OF OFFICERS IN

03:59:23.816 --> 03:59:25.551
THE STATE THAT THIS

03:59:25.617 --> 03:59:27.386
PRESCRIPTION. I THINK IT WOULD

03:59:27.453 --> 03:59:29.655
BE FAR WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM

03:59:29.722 --> 03:59:32.057
THAT IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE. JUST

03:59:32.124 --> 03:59:34.126

GUILTY OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT. THE

03:59:53.112 --> 03:59:54.780

03:59:54.847 --> 03:59:56.749
DID AN INTENTIONAL CRIMINAL ACT

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:58.050
THEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE THEY

03:59:58.117 --> 03:59:58.951
CAN BE HELD PERSONALLY

03:59:59.017 --> 04:00:00.953
RESPONSIBLE BUT IN ALL OTHER

04:00:01.019 --> 04:00:02.454

BUT I'M JUST KIND OF CONFUSE

04:09:05.797 --> 04:09:07.465
THAT PEOPLE ARE CONFLATING

04:09:07.532 --> 04:09:09.000
THEIR PROPOSALS AND YOU KNOW

04:09:09.067 --> 04:09:10.802
WHILE I'M SITTING HERE. I'M

04:09:10.869 --> 04:09:11.770
READING WHAT HAPPENED IN

04:09:11.836 --> 04:09:15.674
COLORADO IN THE IDEA OF TWENTY

FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE PAYS

04:09:19.944 --> 04:09:21.346

THAT'S- HAVE HAVE. AND SO- DOT.

04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:43.935
I'M I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS. OUR

04:09:44.002 --> 04:09:45.904
OUR- THE PEOPLE OBJECT TO IT

04:09:45.970 --> 04:09:48.039

04:09:52.210 --> 04:09:54.179
AN ENTIRE POTENTIAL JUDGMENT OR

THOUSAND DOLLAR PIECE. MISTER

04:09:56.981 --> 04:09:59.784
MISTER AGNEW WAS GOING TO TAKE

04:09:59.851 --> 04:10:00.352
A STAB AT THAT QUESTION REAL

04:10:00.418 --> 04:10:03.321
QUICK. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT

04:10:03.388 --> 04:10:05.357
IT'S REALLY THE CONCEPT I THINK

04:10:05.423 --> 04:10:06.558
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DEGREE IN

04:10:06.624 --> 04:10:08.326
TERMS OF IF YOU WANT TO PUT A

04:10:08.393 --> 04:10:10.829
CAP ON HOW MUCH LIABILITY. THAT

04:10:10.895 --> 04:10:11.930
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL

04:10:11.996 --> 04:10:14.232
PROBLEM THE BIGGEST OF WHICH IS

04:10:14.299 --> 04:10:16.334
THAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:10:16.401 --> 04:10:18.002
LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU WANT TO

04:10:18.069 --> 04:10:19.704
INCENTIVIZE OFFICERS TO DO A

04:10:19.771 --> 04:10:20.872
GOOD JOB BUT ALSO TO HELP

04:10:20.939 --> 04:10:22.874
PEOPLE. AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON

04:10:22.941 --> 04:10:25.410
THE LINE AND- THE NATURE OF

04:10:25.477 --> 04:10:26.811
INSURANCE BUSINESS AND ALL THE

04:10:26.878 --> 04:10:29.381
RHTHMS AND STATISTICS IS THAT

04:10:29.447 --> 04:10:29.814
YOU MAKE PREDICTIVE

04:10:29.881 --> 04:10:33.218
ASSUMPTIONS. BASED ON. THINGS

04:10:33.284 --> 04:10:34.819
THAT ARE THAT ARE FACTUAL

04:10:34.886 --> 04:10:35.954
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT MERIT

04:10:36.020 --> 04:10:37.455
BASED DETERMINATIONS OR THE

04:10:37.522 --> 04:10:39.224
NUANCES OF EACH INCIDENT YOU'RE

04:10:39.290 --> 04:10:40.658
JUST LOOKING AT HOW MANY TIMES

04:10:40.725 --> 04:10:42.594
WERE YOU SOON WERE YOU PRESENT

04:10:42.660 --> 04:10:44.129
WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING.

04:10:44.195 --> 04:10:46.364
NIGHT DID YOU ACT APPROPRIATELY

04:10:46.431 --> 04:10:49.000
WAS A JUSTIFIED AND SO YOU KNOW

04:10:49.067 --> 04:10:50.668
WHETHER IT'S TWENTY FIVE

04:10:50.735 --> 04:10:51.936
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TEN MILLION

04:10:52.003 --> 04:10:54.839
DOLLARS IT'S STILL. I THINK

04:10:54.906 --> 04:10:55.407
SUFFERS FROM THE SAME FATAL

04:10:55.473 --> 04:10:59.277
FLAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ARE

04:10:59.344 --> 04:11:00.845
YOU GOODNESS MCCARTY. YEAH I

04:11:00.912 --> 04:11:02.447
JUST THINK THAT YOU'RE

04:11:02.514 --> 04:11:05.784
CONFLATING IT- AT TWENTY FIVE

04:11:05.850 --> 04:11:06.418
THOUSAND DOLLAR PREMIUM IS NOT

04:11:06.484 --> 04:11:08.653
GOING TO BE. OUT OF THE HANDS

04:11:08.720 --> 04:11:10.155
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WOULD

04:11:10.221 --> 04:11:11.756
PROBABLY BARGAIN AND PAID FOR

04:11:11.823 --> 04:11:14.325
BY THE P. O. A CONTRACT OR

04:11:14.392 --> 04:11:15.994
HAVING A WHOLESALE. BUYING OF

04:11:16.060 --> 04:11:17.228
THE COVERAGE LIKE WE SAW IN

04:11:17.295 --> 04:11:19.531
COLORADO SO. I THINK IT'S AN

04:11:19.597 --> 04:11:21.232
INTRIGUING ISSUE I THINK AS

04:11:21.299 --> 04:11:22.233
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT DOUBLES

04:11:22.300 --> 04:11:24.169
THE DETAILS BUT I DON'T THINK.

04:11:24.235 --> 04:11:25.804
IT SHOULD BE DISMISSED JUST

04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:27.472
BECAUSE THE NATURE OF IT-

04:11:27.539 --> 04:11:28.573
PEOPLE MAY THINK IT'S A

04:11:28.640 --> 04:11:29.908
SLIPPERY SLOPE OR IT SHOULD BE

04:11:29.974 --> 04:11:31.242
HAD IT HAD SHOULD BE DISCUSSED

04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:33.311
AT ALL. THANKS THANK YOU VERY

BRIEF. THE OF LIFE INSURANCE IS

04:11:43.021 --> 04:11:44.622
NOT I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING

04:11:44.689 --> 04:11:45.223
THAT SHOULD JUST BE REJECTED

04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:47.392
OUTRIGHT. I IT'S SOMETHING THAT

04:11:47.459 --> 04:11:49.928
WE HAVE IN DIFFERENT FACETS IN

04:11:49.994 --> 04:11:50.528
AREAS OF OUR LIFE AND THERE'S

04:11:50.595 --> 04:11:52.096
WAYS IN WHICH IF. ANY WOULD

04:11:52.163 --> 04:11:53.798
BROAD STROKES THE IDEA THAT

04:11:53.865 --> 04:11:55.133
WILL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS

04:11:55.200 --> 04:11:57.101
WILL BE JUST TAKEN OUT OF HAND

04:11:59.404 --> 04:12:00.738
SITUATION WHERE OFFICES ARE

04:12:00.805 --> 04:12:02.340
PRICED OUT OF THE PROFESSION.

04:12:02.407 --> 04:12:03.141
FRANKLY WE KNOW FROM THE

04:12:03.208 --> 04:12:05.009

OR THREE TIMES. THOSE ARE THE

04:12:20.158 --> 04:12:20.892
FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE

04:12:20.959 --> 04:12:22.393

THAT WE EVEN HAVE TO BE HERE

04:16:29.540 --> 04:16:31.309
DEMOCRACY THAT ALLOWS US TO

JARVIS ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH

04:16:40.885 --> 04:16:42.286
MY BROTHER WAS ONE OF THREE

04:16:42.353 --> 04:16:43.421
POLICE KILLINGS IN JUST THE

SACRAMENTO. ON WEDNESDAY THE

TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

ACCOUNTABILITY ON BOTH PARTIES

04:16:53.164 --> 04:16:54.599
BUT I'D LIKE TO ADD ACCURATE

04:16:54.665 --> 04:16:56.067

PERSONS THE VIDEO FOOTAGE. AND

04:17:00.071 --> 04:17:01.939
MOST IMPORTANTLY ANOTHER THING

04:17:02.006 --> 04:17:04.175
TO CHANGE IS THE USE OF FORCE

04:17:04.242 --> 04:17:05.810
POLICY THAT ALLOWED OFFICERS TO

04:17:05.877 --> 04:17:07.812
I QUOTE USE DEADLY FORCE IF

04:17:07.879 --> 04:17:09.080
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE

04:17:09.147 --> 04:17:10.581
OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES THE

04:17:10.648 --> 04:17:12.683
SUSPECT POSES A THREAT OF DEATH

04:17:12.750 --> 04:17:14.619
OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY EITHER

04:17:14.685 --> 04:17:17.688

BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW ALL THE

04:17:22.794 --> 04:17:23.961
POLICE OFFICER HAS TO SAY IS I

04:17:24.028 --> 04:17:25.062
FEAR FOR MY LIFE AND THAT GIVES

04:17:25.129 --> 04:17:26.798
THEM THE LICENSE TO KILL. BUT

04:17:26.864 --> 04:17:27.565
WHAT ABOUT MEMBERS OF THE

04:17:27.632 --> 04:17:29.200
COMMUNITY. THEY SOMETIMES FEAR

04:17:29.267 --> 04:17:30.668
FOR THEIR LIVES BUT THEY CAN'T

04:17:30.735 --> 04:17:32.036
JUST GO AROUND KILLING EACH

04:17:32.103 --> 04:17:32.503
OTHER WITHOUT SEVERE

04:17:32.570 --> 04:17:34.539
CONSEQUENCES. THIS POLICY GIVES

04:17:34.605 --> 04:17:36.140
POLICE OFFICERS THE POWER AND

04:17:36.207 --> 04:17:37.441
