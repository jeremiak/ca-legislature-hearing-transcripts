01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.813
EXPERIENCING THE PAST TWO YEARS

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.115
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.217
SIMPLE WAY. OF SAYING TO

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.219
TEACHERS WE CARE WE WANT TO MAKE

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.054
SURE THAT YOU'RE WELL EQUIPPED

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.122
TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.691
TYPE OF CRISIS ON OUR HANDS SO.

KIDS ARE DEALING WITH SOMETHING

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.105
MORE THAN WE CAN DEAL WITH ARE

MANY KIDS I WOULD SAY ONE IS WAY

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:13.382
TOO MANY KIDS BUT- I REALLY WANT

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.450

CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THIS. I

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.086
REALLY HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.321
WOULD SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.822

THAT WE HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.862
SERVICES FOR YOUTH WE'RE NOT

GOING TO BE TEACHERS HAVE A LOT

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:44.900
ON THEIR PLATE. AND THEY HAVE A

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.035
LOT OF THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.170
AND BUT THEY ARE INTERFACING

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.872
WITH THE STUDENTS IN A CLASSROOM

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.574
AND THEY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE TO

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.442
BE ABLE TO HELP IDENTIFY YOUTH

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:56.212

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:58.047
MENTIONED. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.483
TURN THEM INTO MENTAL HEALTH.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.618

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.453
REASON WHY THAT'S THE CASE IS

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.722
BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE
