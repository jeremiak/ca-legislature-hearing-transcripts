00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.762
WAS IN POOR SUPERVISORS PL A WE

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.364
HAVE A CITY WIDE DE LA AND --

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.566
SERVICES CO WHICH I SUPPORTED

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.602
-- I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE AUTHOR

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.637

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.672
TO COME TO THE SENATE BEFORE

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.440
IT GOT DONE -- AND I THINK WE

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:49.775
HAVE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:51.643
SO THAT ARE CONSTRUCTION

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.945
WORKERS ARE ABLE TO BE PART

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.014
OF THE MIDDLE CLASS -- SO THEY

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.015
DON'T HAVE TO COMMUTE THREE

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.184
HOURS TO GO TO WORK -- AND SO

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.920
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.855
IN THE HOUSING THAT THEY ARE

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:05.624

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.663

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.598
IS A LOT OF CONFLICT AROUND

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.033

WITH A MEMBER OF THIS OF THIS

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:09.174
COMMITTEE IN THE FUTURE BUT WE

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:10.141
NEED TO PRESERVE THE HOUSING

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.076
STOCK THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:12.777
BEEN TO IN SHRINE AFFORDABILITY

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.579
FOR DECADES TO COME THIS BILL

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:16.414
DOES JUST THAT AND THE REASON

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.482
THAT I'VE COME IN I'VE STUDIED

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:18.450
THIS CLOSELY AND WE'VE HAD

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:19.584
THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:20.819
HAD TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.787
THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY HERE

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:25.023
-- IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEW

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.092
FINANCING HERE THIS IS ABOUT

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:28.760
EXTENDING A SUNSET I KNOW THERE

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:31.062

KNOW THERE'S NEW PERSPECTIVES

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.799
THAT COME TO LIGHT THIS IS

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:36.268
EXTENDING AN EXISTING PILOT

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.502
PROGRAM TO TEST THE THEORY

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.237
OF WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:40.906

THE PURCHASING ACQUISITION

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.775
AND OTHER ACTIVITIES ARE

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:44.843
GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.977
TO THE MIDDLE INCOME RANGE

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.112
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:48.546
HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ALLOWED

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:50.415
FOR THE LOW INCOME RANGE

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:51.349
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.717
LET THESE SERVICES IN SECOND

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:53.818
TEST THAT QUESTION TO MAKE

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.820
SURE THAT WE HAVE ON ANOTHER

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.255
TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX FOR THE

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:58.757
PROVISION OF MIDDLE INCOME

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:00.659
HOUSING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.660
IS NOT RESPECTFULLY IN THE

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:03.228
OPPOSITION'S LOTTERY BEGINS

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.496
AT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:05.964
PROVIDE PUBLIC FINANCING TO

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.299
DEVELOPING FINANCING HOUSING

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:08.934
PROJECTS EXCEPT IT DOESN'T DO

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.468
THAT AND WE KNOW IT DOESN'T DO

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:11.770
THAT BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR HOUSES

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.405
OF KEY THIS NON FISCAL THERE

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.206
IS NO NEW PUBLIC FINANCING

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:17.542
HERE AND SO FOR ME THE REST

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.644
OF THE CONVERSATION THEN IS

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.479

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:41.125
A JUDGE CERTAIN THE OPPOSITION

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:42.960
I THINK WELL THE NOTICE THAT'S

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.228
PROVIDED BY IN THE AMENDMENTS

ENOUGH NOMINATIONS I WILL

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:01.145
NOTE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:03.180

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.919
AWAY WHEN YOU NOMINATE SOMEBODY

SO PRIOR TO PROVE THAT YOU YOU

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.723
MADE THE NOMINATION AND I THINK

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.558
THE DISCUSSION THAT WAS MADE

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.860

THE BOARD TAKES AN ACTION ON

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.868
THIS AXSOME ACCLAMATION IS

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.904
ANOTHER SAFEGUARD I WILL NOTICE

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:29.006
ITS OUTLINE ON THE FINAL PAGE

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.641
OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS THIS

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.611
WITH A CENTER MORE LOCKED AND

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:37.181
I WAS WORKING ON THE GENERAL

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.916

SO MANY OF THE HOAS ARE SMALL

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.171
