00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.958
TERMS OF THE SORT OF BROUGHT

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.360
OVER STROKES IS THAT THE LAW IS

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.962
WORKING TO PROTECT PATIENTS BUT

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.229
THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.165
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IT'S

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:16.400
ABOUT A THIRTEEN STEP PROCESS

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:17.735
FOR SOMEBODY TO GET THROUGH.

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.770
AND PEOPLE ARE UNFORTUNATELY

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.238
DIE IN TRYING TO GET THROUGH

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.673
THE PROCESS AND NEVER ACHIEVING

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.375
THAT PEACE OF MIND THAT-%

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.911
THEY'RESEEKING- WE'VE SEEN IT

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:29.513
REALLY- THERE'S A TON OF

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.948
DIFFERENT- CHALLENGES WITH THE

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.450
LAW THERE ARE THREE THAT KEEP

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:34.151
EMERGING AS THE TOP THINGS TO

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.753
CONSIDER A DRESSED IN FUTURE

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.690
LEGISLATION- THE FIRST IS THE

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:40.591
FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD.

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:41.792
THERE'S A STUDY THAT CAME OUT

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.861
FROM SOUTHERN SIR- THAT SHOWED

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:46.430
THAT AT LEAST A THIRD OF PEOPLE

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.065
WERE DYING DURING THAT FIFTEEN

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.735
DAY WAITING PERIOD- THAT KAISER

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.737
SOUTHERN IS AS SUPPORTIVE-

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:55.039
INSTITUTION THAT HAS- A PATIENT

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.008
NAVIGATORS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.676
STARTING OUT IN ON SUPPORT OF

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.678
SYSTEMS OR SOMEBODY THAT'S MORE

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.580
FRAGMENTED SO YOU. THAT THE

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.981
NUMBER IS ACTUALLY FAR FAR

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.583
HIGHER THAN THE 30% THAT THEIR

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.785
STUDY SHOWED- THERE ARE OTHER

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.453
STATES THAT ARE ADDRESSING THIS

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.721
WITH SOME INNOVATIVE

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.456
LEGISLATION WERE AGAIN JUST

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.859
PASSED A LAW LAST SESSION. THAT

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.627
MAKES IT SO THAT THE DOCTORS

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:18.496
ARE ALLOWED TO WAIVE THE

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.730
FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IF

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.632
SOMEBODY IS DEFINITELY GONNA

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:26.537
DIE. OR ALSO TO STATE- NEW YORK

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:31.008
IN MINNESOTA AT ARE ACTUALLY A

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.677
LIMóN. RECOGNIZING HER DO IT.

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.612
TEAM MEETING AS CAN SOMEBODY TO

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.781
SUFFER FIFTEEN. AND IT REALLY

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:37.381
IS DOES NOT PROVE TO HAVE ANY

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.084
ANY POSITIVE BENEFITS TO IT-

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.987
THE SECOND BIG CHALLENGE IS

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:44.955
THAT PATIENTS ARE HAVING A

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.323
REALLY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.059
TO DOT. A AND THERE'S A HOST OF

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:50.628
REASONS FOR THIS ONE OF THE TOP

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.830
ONES THAT- REASONS IS THAT AS

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.131
YOU KNOW THERE'S AN OPT OUT

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.599
PROVISION FOR HEALTH SYSTEM SO

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.001
HELP SYSTEMS ARE ALLOWED TO

00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:59.203
ALLOW ALL OF THEIR- DOCTORS- TO

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.205
NOT BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:04.008
AS A RESULT OF THAT- THERE WAS

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.609
A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.044
JAMMEH THAT SHOWED THAT NINETY

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.145
SEVEN PERCENT. RELIGIOUS

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:10.648
INSTITUTIONS ALLOW PERSON IS A

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.650
PATIENT AND 35% OF SECULAR

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:15.286
HOSPITALS SO THAT REALLY

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:17.354
NARROWS THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.389
THAT ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:21.492
TO PARTICIPATE AT. WITH US SO

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.060
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS AND

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:24.228
THEN SOME OF THE PAPERWORK THAT

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.464
IS INVOLVED- IT REALLY CHECK

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.832
TEACHING PEOPLE DOCTORS HOW TO

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:30.301
DO THAT I AM. ALSO PRESENTS A

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.203
BARRIER AS WELL WHEN THEY HAVE

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.404
TO DO THAT SAME THING FOR OTHER

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.373
END OF LIFE OPTIONS. THERE ARE-

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.141
THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.242
STATES ARE LOOKING AT TO

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:41.145
ADDRESS THIS- NEW MEXICO HAS A

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.313
REALLY INNOVATIVE PERMIT

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.881
PARISIAN THAT WAS IN THEIR LAST

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.016
LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS A

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.184
PERSON WHO WAS ALREADY ON

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:49.053
HOSPICE CARE TO ALL. HAVE TO

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.854
GET ONE ADDITIONAL

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.523
CERTIFICATION SO THEY'VE MET

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.625
CERTIFICATION HAVING THAT SIX

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.793
MONTH ELIGIBLE CRITERIA. THE

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.328
ALL TO FIND ONE OTHER DOCTOR

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.764
THAT WOULD BE THE PRESCRIBING

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.499
DOCTOR. FIVE STATES THAT ARE

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.601
RIGHT. DANCING THAT WOULD

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:07.805
EXTEND- THE PRIVILEGES SO THAT-

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:10.241
APR ENDS AND PHYSICIANS'

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:12.309
ASSISTANTS ARE ALLOWED TO

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:12.877
PRESCRIBE. SO THERE'S FIVE

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.278
STATE DOING THAT THAT'S

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.546
LEGISLATURE. RIGHTLY ADVANCING

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:16.947
THROUGH HAWAII THIS SESSION

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:19.016
THEY'VE MADE IT THE PHARMACIST-

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.618
AND THEN THERE ARE SOME STATES

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.052
THAT HAVE LESS REPORTING

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.654
REQUIREMENTS THAN WHAT IS HERE

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.022
IN CALIFORNIA BOTH VERMONT AND

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.390
COLORADO DO AND OF COURSE

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.759
MONTANA HAS NON BECAUSE IT'S

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:33.397
THROUGH THE COURTS. THE THIRD-

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.599
BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE WITH

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.134
THE LAW IS THAT THERE IS A LACK

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:39.103
OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE PRACTICE

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.438
SOMETIMES PATIENTS ARE NOT

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:42.540
GETTING COMPLETE INFORMATION

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:43.574
FROM THEIR HEALTH CARE

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:45.109
PROVIDERS YOU'LL HEAR SOME

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.244
STORIES ABOUT THAT LATER TODAY-

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:49.113
OTHER DOCTORS TO OBJECT TO THE

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.550
PRACTICE ARE REFUSE- PATIENCE-

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.819
REFUSING TO EVEN REFERRED TO

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.954
ANOTHER PRACTICE AND SUMMER

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:57.688
EVEN HOLDING MEDICAL. CARD

00:40:57.755 --> 00:41:01.826
HOSTAGE- THAT IS JUST CRAZY- IN

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:03.360
DELAWARE THEY HAVE A PROVISION

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.995
I'M IN THEIR BILL THAT WOULD

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:06.897
ALLOW HEALTH FACILITIES THAT

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:09.300
POP OUT OF THE PRACTICE- TO

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:09.834
IMPLEMENT GET NOT TO BE.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.901
IMPLEMENTED BORDERS ON THEIR

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:13.404
DOCTORS TO SILENCE THEM- AND

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.338
THEN THERE IS PENDING IN

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.140
WASHINGTON STATE LEGISLATION

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.942
THAT WOULD REQUIRE HOSPICES

00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:19.577
HOSPITALS TO REPORT THEIR

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.744
POLICIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.479
HEALTH. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.848
HEALTH CAN PUBLISH THEM AND

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.416
THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW PATIENTS

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.218
TO BE ABLE TO SELECT THEIR

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:30.221
FACILITIES BASED ON- THOSE THAT

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:31.956
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR VALUES

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:34.091
AND PRIORITIES THEY'RE ONLY

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.526
DOING HOSPITALS BUT WHAT WOULD

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:40.564
BE RIDLEY INNOVATIVE IS IF YOU

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:43.267
DID HOSPICES. WELL I THE SORT

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.668
OF BIG. C. AS YOU CAN WHERE

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:45.236
WRECK. THE X. OF ELIGIBLE

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:47.071
CRITERIA REMOVING ANY OF THE

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.973
COURSE SAVE CAR TO REALLY JUST

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.442
LOOKING FR VERY. PRACTICAL

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:53.410
WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS SOME

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.379
OF THE CHALLENGES SO THAT YOU

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:56.747
BEAT THE ORIGINAL TENSION OF A

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:59.783
LOT BETTER. I'M GONNA END WITH

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.218
PERHAPSMY MOST IMPORTANT

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:02.419
MESSAGE OF THE DAY WHICH IS

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.355
REALLY ONE OF GRATITUDE-

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.390
WITHOUT QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:07.958
AND OF LIFE OPTION ACT HAS

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:08.893
RESULTED IN A MORE

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.661
COMPASSIONATE AND OF LIFE

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.996
EXPERIENCE BOTH FOR THOSE WHO

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.697
CHOOSE AND HE TAKE THE OPTION.

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:16.166
BUT ALSO FOR EVERYBODY ELSE- IN

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.736
ADDITION SINCE CALIFORNIA-

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:20.838
IMPLEMENTED THIS LAW FIVE OTHER

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.040
STATES HAVE PASSED VERY SIMILAR

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.042
LEGISLATION AND WE KNOW FROM

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:27.211
EXPERIENCE THAT CALIFORNIA SUCH

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:28.679
A ROUGH ROBUST IN LARGE AND

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:31.315
DIVERSE STATE. TAKING THIS

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.750
IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.351
WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.953
GAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS LAWMAKERS

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.657

WORK YOU'RE DOING EVERY DAY NOW

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:03.207
IN I'M FOLLOW UP. BEGIN

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:05.476
AMENDMENT ON THE FIFTEEN DAY

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:08.479
WAITING PERIOD. IT'S NOW

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:10.814
DISCRETIONARY WITH THE

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.883
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN LIFE HERE

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.419
SHEEN DETERMINES THAT THAT

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.488
FIFTEEN DAY WAIT WOULD BE

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.990
ONEROUS- THEY HAVE THE

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.992
AUTHORITY- AND THEN I THINK YOU

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.327
MENTIONED A COUPLE OF OTHER

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:25.996
STATES THAT ARE ALSO. NOT

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.865
REQUIRING THE FIFTEEN DAYS

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.400
THERE'S TWO STATES THAT HAVE

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.702
LEGISLATION PENDING IN NEW YORK

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.237
AND I THINK IT'S MINNESOTA

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.272
THAT- WOULD ELIMINATE IT BUT

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:38.342
IT'S NOT PASSED YET OKAY. MOM

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.977
BUT THOSE ALSO MIGHT PROVIDE A

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.946
MODEL OF- HOW PEOPLE ARE

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:46.250
APPROACHING IT LEGISLATIVELY-

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:48.285
COULD CERTAINLY WE HAVE HEARD

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.953
IN OUR OFFICES IN IN THE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.257
HEARING THAT. THE CHAIR HOSTED

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:56.060
LAST YEAR. THAT WAS THE

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.362
TESTIMONY THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:03.801
OF COERCION OF. BAD OUTCOMES-

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.702
ALL OF THE FOCUS WAS PEOPLE WHO

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:08.472
WERE THE IMPEDIMENT WAS THE

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.641
FIFTEEN DAYS SO I THINK THAT

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:12.709
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE ON OUR

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:17.414
RADAR FOR ANY- FUTURE- IN THE

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.283
LEGAL ARENA YOU DIDN'T REALLY

ADDRESS THIS BUT- WE'VE- FACE

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.722
CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA. ON

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.724
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DEFENDS

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.560
CALIFORNIA'S LAW IN HAS BEEN

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.729
DOING A GREAT JOB OF DOING THAT

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:35.065
I'M ARE THERE WHAT'S THE STATUS

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.601

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:40.037
NATIONALLY OR- OTHERS PENDING

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:42.739
IN CALIFORNIA- SO OUT IN

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.942
CALIFORNIA- JUST FOR I'M SURE

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:45.809
YOU KNOW BUT FOR THOSE WHO

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.879
DON'T KNOW- THE CASE- IN THE

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.914
DISTRICT COURT- JUST FOUND THAT

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:51.882
THE LAW WAS PASSED

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:53.517
CONSTITUTIONALLY. AND THAT THE

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:55.385
OPPOSITION DID NOT- HAVE

00:45:55.452 --> 00:45:56.620
STANDING TO BRING ALL THE OTHER

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:58.555
CLAIMS FORWARD OUR

00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:00.424
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TODAY-

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:05.162
THAT COURT CASE IS SUPPOSED TO-

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:05.762
THERE THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.731
ELENA. ST I'M DISTRICT COURT

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:09.032
LEVEL WHAT THAT AMENDED

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.801
COMPLAINT WILL SAY BUT THAT'S

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:11.935
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TODAY AND IF

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.270
IT HAPPENS AT SOME POINT WHILE

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:15.005
WE'RE HERE WHAT WILL LET YOU

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:16.707
KNOW- IN TERMS OF NATIONAL

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:19.610
LAWSUITS- THERE IS A LAWSUIT IN

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:22.679
NEW JERSEY- A DOCTOR IS

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:23.413
CLAIMING YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.217
TO- OR FOR. OR HANDLE MEDICAL.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.118
AND THAT EVEN THAT IS A

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.653
VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.555
RIGHT AND THAT THE LAW- AS PAST

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.558
SHOULD NOT BE- VALID OR LEGAL-

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:35.626
SO THAT'S MAKING ITS WAY

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.528
THROUGH THE COURTS- AS WELL IN

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.096

OPT OUT OF PARTICIPATING IT'S

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:09.059
TO THE POINT THE WAY THEY'RE

WRITTEN WHERE A PERSON A

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.063

NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT-

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.944
NATIONALLY- I WANTED TO TALK A

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:03.213
LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE DIFFERENT

IN ANY OF THE OTHER TEN-

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:11.388
EXPERIENCES STATE EXPERIENCES.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:14.558
THERE IS ANY KIND OF. MORE THAN

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:18.262
ENCOURAGEMENT BUT MANDATE TO

AND THE INSTITUTIONS BUT I'M

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.246
WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S BEEN

ANY PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.750

00:48:57.401 --> 00:49:00.304
ALLEN THAT WERE SEEN AROUND

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:00.904
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM VERSUS PAID

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:05.976

MIGHT BE SOME AT- WELL. WILLING

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.583
TO TAKE ON OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.352
AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO IS

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:16.486
BILLS REALLY STRONGLY THAT

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.388
PATIENT SHOULD HAVE. A VOICE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:22.526
AND THAT A DOCTOR'S- SORT OF-

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:26.897
DOCTORS CAN OPT OUT SHOULD NOT

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:28.865
OVER. FOR IN. THAT WOULD BE

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:29.433
GREAT TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:30.000
WAYS TO DO DEL PROBLEM. THE

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:31.001
CLOSEST WITH THE PROVISION THEY

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:34.071
HAVE IN THEIR BILL- BUT- NO ONE

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:35.072
HAD NO ONE IS AUTHORIZED

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:37.274
LEGISLATION THAT HAS. REALLY

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.609
ADDRESSED THE ISSUE. I'VE

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:40.944
NOTICED THAT OVER THE LAST FEW

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.046
YEARS SINCE HE HAS SPENT A

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:45.782
GREAT DEAL OF BOB. EFFORT

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.584
TALKING ABOUT HOW ALZHEIMER'S

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.820
AND PARKINSON'S. AND I'M

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:51.221
CURIOUS AS TO WHERE YOUR

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.423
ORGANIZATION IS AT THIS POINT

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.958
WITH THE TEN STATES AND THAT

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.693
ISSUE SURE- AND THAT IS

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.962
INCIDENTLY WHEN PEOPLE COME

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.197
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS BILL HERE

00:50:00.263 --> 00:50:02.299
THAT IS THE MAJOR ISSUE THAT

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.467
SENIORS BURN UP ALL THE TIME.

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:06.236
YEAH I MENTION YEAH SO WE CAN

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.038
OPERATE OUT MEDICAL AID IN

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:09.473
DYING FROM HOW TO ADDRESS

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.375
ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA AS YOU

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.777
KNOW FROM PASSING THIS LOG BOOK

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.746
POOR SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE PART

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:17.447
OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING IS THAT

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:18.915
THE PERSON HAS TO BE MENTALLY

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.484
CAPABLE AND ABLE TO SELF AND

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.553
JUST THE MEDICATION- AND- IF

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.389
YOU IMAGINE GIVEN THE INEQUITY.

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:27.190
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR HOW.

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:30.394
DUMB BEAT. THAT MIGHT HAVE IF

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.096
WE WERE TO EXTEND THAT TO-

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.699
SOMEBODY WHO'S LOOKING YOU LOOK

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:36.333
AT THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DOING

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.601
THAT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:38.702
ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CARE

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:41.304
SYSTEMS- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:42.806
THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW PEOPLE

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.541
WITH DEMENTIA TO DIE IN THERE

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.910
ARE EGGS ACTUALLY LEGAL

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:49.880
EXISTING OPTIONS RIGHT NOW THAT

THEY WOULD ONE OR GO TO. AT

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:22.846
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM REALIZE A

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:23.747
NATURAL DEATH AND IT WILL CUT

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:24.514
YEARS OF THEIR- YOU KNOW IT'S

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.182

MEDICATIONS THERE'S ALL KINDS

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.087
OF WAYS THAT WE CAN SHORTEN THE

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.122
LENGTH OF TIME SOMEONE SUFFERS

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.624

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.968
GETTING A SYSTEM TO SUPPORT YOU

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.837

THING AND IT IT- IT'S

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:50.133
CHALLENGING- BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.234
DOCTORS DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:54.037
ABLE TO OPT OUT I BELIEVE THAT-

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.639

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:56.806
CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AROUND THAT

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:59.576

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.415
A GOOD SHOT OF PASSING AT THIS

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.050

POT OF CARE. THERE'S A LOT OF

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.800
TIME WE WORK WITH PATIENTS THAT

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.235
HAVE A CHRONIC AND DEBILITATING

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:46.970
ILLNESSES WHERE WE ARE

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:49.172
FORTUNATELY INTO A IS THAT

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:52.242
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO OFFER MEDICAL

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:54.277

BALK CAN YOU TO ARM MAKE THEM

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:59.415
DECLINE SLOWLY INTO RATE AND

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:04.387
THIS LAW I WAS THAT RETAIN SOME

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:08.958
OF THAT CONTROL ABLE TO USE.

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.593
THANK WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.362
HELLO ROLL I'M RATHER THAN

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:12.996
LETTING THE DISEASE DO THAT FOR

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.364
THEM. OUR WITH MIKE'S. I WOULD

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.266
CAN PAY BUT- SEE WHAT END STAGE.

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.334
DOES TO SO. IS A IS A TERRIBLE

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.470
THING TO WITNESS- SEEING THEIR

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:22.038
FAMILIES WATCH THEM SLOWLY

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.541
DECLINE. IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:27.243
AND- BEING ABLE TO ALLOW

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.379
SOMEONE TO CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT

00:57:29.445 --> 00:57:32.382
TO DIE WHEN WE- WANT TO A LOT

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:32.982
LET THEM CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:35.285
TO LIVE I THINK IS A VERY VERY

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.353
IMPORTANT THING. I'M SO THEY

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.355
CAN KEEP SOME OF THE NITTY. TO

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:41.724
ME I. AT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.292
A LOT OF THESE PATIENTS ARE

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:43.860
THEY'RE GOING TO INTO OR

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:46.462
WHETHER PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL.

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:48.031
OF SOME OF THE BARRIERS I'VE

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:49.933
ENCOUNTERED- AS I THINK CAME AS

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:52.802
ALREADY MENTIONED. ARE I DON'T

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:53.236
THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:55.705
PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS- IN MY

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.507
EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:58.942
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S JUST A

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:01.244
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING MAYBE OF

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.979
THE LAW- FROM THE PROVIDER

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.148
STANDPOINT- AND UNCERTAINTY

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:06.850
ABOUT WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:08.852
LIKE. AND I THINK THAT WILL GET

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:10.453
BETTER AS WE'VE HAD MORE DATA

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.988
AND MORE EXPERIENCES WITH THESE

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:14.290
PATIENT. COUNTERS AND SEEING

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:15.992
THESE GOOD OUTCOMES I THINK

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.393
THAT THAT WILL CHANGE. AS WELL

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.728
AS PROVIDING ON AFTER FOR

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.864
EDUCATION FOR A PHYSICIAN

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.666
COLLEAGUES I'VE ALSO FOUND A-

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:24.767
PERIOD AGAIN AS AS PREVIOUSLY

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.536
MENTIONED BY THE TIME A PATIENT

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:27.971
HAS COME TO ME. ARE THEY ARE

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:30.607
INCREDIBLY ILL AND IT'S OFTEN

00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:32.075
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE IT

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.643
TO THAT FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.111
I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES WERE

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:35.979
PATIENTS THAT HAD TO YOU KNOW

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:38.081
BE BROUGHT IN ON GURNEYS. AND

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.617
THEY TELL ME THAT IN ITSELF IS-

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.851
VERY DEMORALIZING AFTER

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:42.585
EVERYTHING THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.754
THROUGH. A OR THE ACTUALLY DIE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.256
IN THE PROCESS BEFORE THEY ARE

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:47.724
ABLE TO MAKE IT'S THAT FOLLOW

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.561
UP. I HAVE ONE PATIENT COUNTER

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.263
SPECIFICALLY THAT- WAS VERY

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.131
MEANINGFUL TO ME. I HAD THE

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.132
OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING CARE OF

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.268
THIS WOMAN. FOR ALMOST TWO

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.603
YEARS OF VERY HIGHLY EDUCATED

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.039
INDIVIDUAL- AND THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:05.141
COURSE OF HER DIAGNOSIS SHE WAS

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.876
A VERY REASONABLE PERSON I'VE

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:09.012
HAD VERY REAL EXPECTATIONS. FOR

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:10.914
HER PROGNOSIS AS WELL AS FOR

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.982
TREATMENT OUTCOMES. AND SHE

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.517
KNEW AND SHE VERBALIZE TO ME

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:15.852
THAT YOU KNOW MIRACLES RARELY

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.588

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:04.460
RURAL AREA. NOT IN ONE OF THE

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:05.895
BIG SITES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:07.463
HEAR A YOU'LL HEAR MOST ABOUT

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.265
NOT FROM A BIG AREA. BUT

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.033
BECAUSE WE BEGUN TO DO THIS

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.835
TRAINING LOOKING AT THE ACCESS

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:15.538
PROBLEM- AND BY THE WAY HER

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.707
RACIAL DOCTORS WERE IN THE

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.642
CATHOLIC SYSTEM AND- LOOKED AT

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.644
HER LIKE SHE WAS LIKE. NO ONE

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.078
WAS GONNA HAVE THAT

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.646
CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE DID

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.814
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.982
INFORMATION. SO ONE OF MY MAIN

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.718
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.453
RIGHT NOW THE LAW DOES NOT SAY

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.054
ANY PHYSICIAN IS OBLIGATED TO

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.689
SAY A THING. IT SAYS PATIENTS

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.825
HAVE ACCESS YOU KNOW HAVE THE

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.426
RIGHT. TO IT BUT THERE'S

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.929
NOTHING THAT SAYS ANYTHING

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.831
ABOUT WHAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:42.998
FOR SO I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:45.534
LOOK AT WHAT COULD WE DO THAT

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:46.902
IS THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:49.105
HEALTH. JUSTICE IN THIS STATE

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.439
AND HEALTH JUSTICE AS IF YOU

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.274
DON'T KNOW TO ASK. YOU WILL NOT

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.311
FIND OUT SO HOW CAN WE REALLY

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.079
LOOK AT THAT AND BE MORE

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.714
PROACTIVE ABOUT HOW WE GIVE

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.483
INFORMATION NOT ALL OPTIONS

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.884
INCLUDING THE LEGAL AID AN

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.053
OPTION DYING IN. MULTIPLE

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.456
LANGUAGES. AND THAT BECAUSE OUR

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:10.226
HEALTH SYSTEM REALLY DOES IS IT

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.861
IS NOT ADDRESSING HEALTH

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.662
JUSTICE INCLUDING THIS IN MY

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.331
OPINION RIGHT NOW. AND THEN THE

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:16.699
SECOND THING IS THAT IT REALLY

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.801
DOES- PROCESS ITSELF IS BASED

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.270
ON AUTONOMY WHICH IS ALSO NOT.

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:22.705
PARTICULARLY CULTURALLY

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.673
APPROPRIATE TO THE OTHER CASE I

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.443
HAD HAD TO DO WITH A YOUNG

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.345
BLACK NEXT PAGE MINE. WHO

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.480
REALLY DID HIS FAMILY TO BE

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.816
INVOLVED AND THE WAY THE SYSTEM

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.353
IT WORKS IT. TO BE A RELATION I

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.924
TIME ISSUE AND SO. WE WERE ABLE

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:42.558
TO WORK THAT IS BUT JUST NOTE

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.960
SELF. CAME UP VERY MUCH THROUGH.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.328
THE A PATIENT AUTONOMY

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.297
PERSPECTIVE AND THAT MAY NOT BE

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.899
APPROPRIATE FOR ALL POPULATION

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.500
SO JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.735
WE PROBABLY WOULD MORE MOVING

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.603
THROUGH IN CALIFORNIA WE COULD

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.972
ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WE INHERITED

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.007
FROM OREGON AND WASHINGTON

01:07:58.073 --> 01:07:59.742
MAYBE PERHAPS NOT AS DIVERSE AS

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:00.643
OUR OWN STATE AND WE HAVE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.944
OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO ADDRESS

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.746
THAT AS WELL. AND YOU HAVE

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.181
SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR BOTH YOUR

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.849
FIRST AND YOUR SECOND POINT I'M

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.385
LEARNING OKAY YEAH I LEARNING-

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.321
SO THE ANSWER IS I BELIEVE. I

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.222
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT I

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.657
KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE TO WORK

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:17.026

01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:19.128
BUSH AT IN AND SOUTHERN

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.563
CALIFORNIA IS. ONE OF PEOPLE I

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.698
WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH AND

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.733
THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE. ON IN

SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BASED ON THIS

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.504
WE'RE WORKING ON HOW CAN ALSO

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:30.306
WE ADDRESS- PROVIDERS WERE

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.775
TALKING ABOUT DOING TRAININGS

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:33.809
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK AND

HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.011
WHICH HAVE. THEIR SPECIALS HAVE

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.047
LONGER TIME THAN PRIMARY CARE.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:41.917

TIME. THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.162
WORDS THAT WORK THE TRAINING

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.255
THE CONVERSE. YOU WHY. BECAUSE

OF YOU'RE POOR YOU SURE

KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK. SO

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.531
AGAIN. PULLING THESE PIECES OUT

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:03.666
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME WORK

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.935
TO DO THERE AND OUT ENCOURAGE

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.136
YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO ACTUALLY

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:08.804
READ THAT REPORTS OF IT'S AN

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.472
EXCELLENT REPORT WITH A BIG

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:13.075
DATA BASE LOOKING AT. HOW DO WE

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.810
DO AT THE END OF LIFE AND WHAT

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.278
CAN WE DO BETTER THIS IS ONE

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.581
PIECE OF IT- SO I'LL END WITH

01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:20.916
THIS OTHER- STORY WHICH IS MY

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:24.219
OWN FAMILY. I THINK- RELATIVE

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:25.588
TO OTHER PHYSICIANS IN THE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.556
STATE I MIGHT KNOW A LITTLE

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:31.060
BIT. ACCESS TO CARE MY UNCLE-

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:33.529
CAME DOWN AFTER HOSPITALIZATION

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.864
IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON- HAD

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:38.334
HAD ACCESS TO CARE THERE AND

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.970
END OF LIFE AND IT TURNS OUT.

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.838
THERE'S NO RECIPROCITY. SO IF

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.173
YOU START THE PROCESS IN ONE

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.141
STATE AND YOU COME HERE YOU

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:49.411
RESET THE CLOCK. AND IT WAS

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.146
LOVELY HE HAD A LOVELY HOSPICE

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.248
DEATH WELL SUPPORTED BY THE

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:53.882
PALLIATIVE CARE COMMUNITY IN MY

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:57.853
OWN CITY OF SANTA CRUZ. BUT IT

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.221
MADE ME THINK A LITTLE BIT

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:01.256
ABOUT AS WERE EXPANDING WITH

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:02.925
ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS NOW

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:06.395
WITH ACCESS COULD WE ADJUST SO

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.797
THAT IF YOU START SOMEPLACE

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:12.167
ELSE COULD WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:15.671
AS STARTED IN OUR STATE- AND I

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.239
WILL WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:20.109
LOVED FOR HIM TO HAVE ACCESS HE

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.243
WAS AT THE BEDSIDE FROM FROM MY

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:24.847
AUNT WHO HAD A BEAUTIFUL- EIGHT

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.849
AND DOT CRY IN THE SPOT. AID IN

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:29.485
DYING- DEATH IN WASHINGTON HE

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.553
WAS NOT AFFORDED THAT HERE IN

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.456
HIS TIME BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:37.292
HELP OF OUR FAMILY AND HE CAME

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:38.460
TO WHERE HE NEEDED HIS SOCIAL

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.929
SUPPORT AND IT'S THE REVERSE OF

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:43.766
WHAT WE HAD. A FIVE YEARS AGO

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:44.933
AND ISN'T THAT INTERESTING AND

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.302
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL ALL AT

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.171
ONCE SO THANK YOU FOR THE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.539
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.840
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:52.941
SITES IN YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.177
CONSIDER IMPROVING ON WHAT IS

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.111
ARTISTS BEGAN HERE IN

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:58.380
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALL

01:11:58.447 --> 01:11:59.782
YOUR ALL YOUR WORK AND

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.116
DEDICATION AND IN SPREADING THE

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:02.084
WORD AND HELPING OTHER

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.686
PHYSICIANS I THINK THAT'S IT

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:04.486
THE YOU TOUCHED ON SOMETHING

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.921
VERY KEY AROUND THE ISSUE OF

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.956
ACCESS AND I JUST LIKE TO ASK

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:10.092
MAYBE FOR BOTH OF YOU BUT THE

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:14.830
ISSUE OF THE IDEA CAME UP.

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.498
BEFORE BUT IF YOU'RE IN HOT

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:18.500
STAND OUT THAT COULD SEE AS-

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.068
ONE THE ONE OF THE POINT IN

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:20.269
TIME. BUT IT ARE THE ARE THE

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.137
REALLY HOSP. ALSO NOT

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.106
PARTICIPATING RIGHT SO IF THE

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.174
IF THEY ARE PART OF THAT SAME

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.509
SYSTEM THEN WE'RE FACED WITH

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:28.410
SOME OF THE SAME HURDLES. I

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.345
THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS ONCE A

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.314
HOSPICE REFERRAL IS MADE THAT

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:35.150
BY DEFINITION IS A SIX MONTH-

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:39.488
SO IT IT'S. A QUALIFIER IT'S

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.022
NOT THAT YOU RELY ON THAT

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:40.656
HOSPICE. RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE OF

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.957
THE QUALIFY EXCEPT. IT'S

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.193
INSTEAD OF A- A VISIT IS THE

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:46.161
POINT SO THAT'S THE IT THE

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:48.197
ADVANTAGES THAT GIVES YOU THAT.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.432
BY THE WAY I THINK ALSO. JUST

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.266
WATCHING PEOPLE THROUGH THE

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:54.303
PROCESS- NOW THAT THAT WAITING

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.171
PERIOD DOESN'T. MAKES IT

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:58.073
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT DOES

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.775
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HAVING TO

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.610
PEOPLE'S THINKING CAPS. IS

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:04.113
THIS. DOES IT IS THE SIM BAY

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.981
TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS. THAT'S A

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.380
THAT I HAD GO THROUGH EMAIL

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.549
AWAY. AND HE BASICALLY CAME TO

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.151
ME IT LITERALLY ON THE DAY THE

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:12.154
LAW WAS WENT INTO PRACTICE. HE

WHO SOUGHT THE FOR THE HOLY

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:24.366
GRAIL- AND HE HE WAS A VERY

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.535
AFFABLE MAN IN HIS LATE

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:29.004
NINETIES. WHO HAD DEVELOPED IN

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:31.907
STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE I AND

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.576
TRIED DIALYSIS FOUND THAT HE

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.977
FELT PRETTY MISERABLE ON THE

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.846
DAY OF DIALYSIS AND ALSO THE

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.749
DAY AFTER DIALYSIS WHICH IS FOR

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:41.550
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW THE

SCHEDULE OF DIALYSIS PRETTY

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:45.353
MUCH EVERY DAY. SO HE MADE A

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.388
VERY DIFFICULT DECISION OF

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.757
TAKING HIMSELF OFF OF DIALYSIS

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:50.425
AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT HE

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.094
WOULD PASS PRETTY QUICKLY BUT

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.929
HE LASTED A LOT LONGER THAN

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.964
PEOPLE HAD PREDICTED. AND JUST

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.699
KIND OF SLOWLY LINGERED WITH

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:01.736
PROGRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AS TOXINS

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:04.272
BUILT UP IN HIS BODY. IT'S A HE

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:04.840

DECENT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE-

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:14.049
AND HE RELAYED TO ME I ASKED

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.650
HIM WHY ARE YOU SEEKING THIS

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.853
OUT. NOT KNOWING WHAT THE

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.589
ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE- AND HE

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:23.992
TOLD ME THAT HE WAS YOU KNOW A

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:25.494
YEAR AGO PLAYING DOUBLES TENNIS.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.631
I AND- THAT NOW HE HE CAN'T GET

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:30.565
OUT OF BED WITHOUT SOMEBODY

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.400
HELPING HIM HE CAN'T GO INTO

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:33.768
HIS GARDENING LIKE HE ALWAYS

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:36.104
USED TO DO. AND BECAUSE OF THE

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.939
TOXINS BUILDING UP IN HIS BLOOD

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:40.008
HIS TASTE BUDS DIDN'T WORK

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:40.609
ANYMORE AND EVERYTHING TASTED

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:43.512

KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:52.787
QUESTION WAS GONNA BE IN HE

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:55.357
SAID. IN THIS IS INTERESTING

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.391
THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.727
FREQUENTLY HERE IS THAT WHEN I

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:02.030
AM UNABLE TO WIPE MY OWN BEHIND

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:31.826
WAS AMAZING WE HAD A MEMORIAL

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:32.561
FOR DAD WHILE HE WAS STILL

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:34.729
ALIVE. AND SURROUNDED BY

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.566
EVERYBODY HE WENT OUT WITH THE

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.935
SUNSET ON HIS PORCH. WITH HIS

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:42.103
FAVORITE MUSIC PLAYING. AND

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:45.273
THAT IS REALLY UNIQUE AND I

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.976
WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING THAT.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.911
BECAUSE PEOPLE BEFORE NOW I

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:50.612
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.082
PLAN THEIR- DEATHS- BUT THIS

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.418
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PUT THAT FINAL

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.819
SENTENCE ON THAT LAST CHAPTER

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:58.920
OF THEIR LIFE IN THE PERIOD ON

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:01.957
THAT LAST. SENTENCE OF THE LAST

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:05.360
CHAPTER. I'M SO WHAT DID I FROM

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:08.930
PERCIVAL ONE THING IS THAT A

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:09.531
DIGNITY IS IN THE EYE OF THE

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:13.335
BEHOLDER I I'M A DOCTOR AND SO

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.003
WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT IN WRITING

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.239
HIS OWN BEHIND WOULD BE KIND OF

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:20.542
THE FINAL OKAY I'M DONE. MOMENT

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.643
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD HAVE

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.645
CHOSEN BECAUSE TO ME THAT

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.347
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT MUCH OF A

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.716
LOSS OF DIGNITY. BUT TO HIM

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:30.018
THAT MEANT MY LIFE IS NO LONGER

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.753
WORTH LIVING AND THAT'S NOT

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.955
GOING TO COME BACK SO HE HAD

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:36.658
BEEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. IN

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.526
HOSPICE THIS WHOLE TIME AND

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.761
THEY'D BEEN MANAGING SOME OF

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.062
HIS OTHER SYMPTOMS BUT THERE

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.264
ARE SOME THINGS THAT HOSPICE

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.165
CANNOT MANAGE. FOR INSTANCE

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.066
PROGRESSIVE DECLINE AND

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.235
FUNCTIONING. HE'S NOT GONNA GET

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.436
THAT BACK HE'S NOT GONNA BE

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.804
ABLE TO PLAY DOUBLES TENNIS

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:54.075
AGAIN. NO MATTER WHAT- AND AS

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.910
AND LOSS OF DIGNITY AND LOSS OF

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.646
DIGNITY IS NOT UP TO ME TO THE

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.147
FINER FOR ANYBODY TO DEFINE

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:02.617
IT'S UP TO YOU. SO AND BY THE

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.419
WAY JUST A QUICK SIDE NOTE I DO

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.087
TAKE ISSUE THAT SOMEHOW THE

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.856
TERM DEATH DIGNITY HAS BECOME

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.291
ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL AID IN

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.860
DYING BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.194
HOSPICE CAN OF DIGNIFIED

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:17.065
DEATHS- WHO ARE. NOT IN HOSPICE

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.466
IN CHOOSE TO JUST CONTINUE TO

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.368
PLOW THROUGH WITH AGGRESSIVE

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.637
CHEMO RIGHT UNTIL THE END THEY

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.606
CAN HAVE A DIGNIFIED DEATH TO.

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:27.008
DIGNITY IS UP TO USED TO DEFINE

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.176
AND WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.578
LOST DIGNITY THAT'S THAT'S

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:33.214
PERSONAL SMALLER WE HAD. I

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.517
REMIND MYSELF NOW ANYTIME I SEE

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.818
SOMEBODY WITH A TERMINAL

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:39.688
CONDITION THAT- THE LIFETIME

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.723
PREVALENCE TOO MUCH TO

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.091
EVERYBODY'S SURPRISE THE

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.126
LIFETIME PREVALENCE OF DEATH IS

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:52.734
A 100% SO. EVERY HI IS. AND

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.436
DEATH. BOTH IN IN TRANSIT IN

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.471
THIS. THE THAT IT'S HAPPENED TO

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.240
LITERALLY EVERYBODY. HIM THAT'S

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.443
EVER EXISTED BIRTH AND DEATH.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.245
IT'S AN INTRINSICALLY UNIQUE

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:08.583
ANY DEEPLY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:11.019
SO NO TWO DEATHS ARE THE SAME

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.688
AND SO BEING ABLE TO GIVE

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:16.358
PEOPLE ANOTHER OPTION FOR HOW

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:19.027
THEY CAN EXPERIENCE IT IS

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.663
IMMENSELY POWERFUL SO THAT WE

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.665
DON'T JUST HAVE DISEASE WHAT WE

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.433
CALL DISEASE DIRECTED CARE

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.968

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:29.804
PLOWING THROUGH WITH DIALYSIS

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:31.873

SHE- KIND OF ACCEPTED THAT HE

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:03.217
WAS. AND HE ACCEPTED THAT HE

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.153
WAS TYING A LOT FASTER THAN SHE

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.387

WAS AN EXPERIENCE AFTER THE

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:30.812
FACT. SO KIND OF IN CLOSING. I

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:31.546
JUST WANT TO MENTION HOW

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.248
POURTANT LAW IS FOR. POWER

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:37.352
BEING EVIL. AND DISENFRANCHISED

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:40.188
POPULATION- OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:42.857
DYING OF WHICH EVERYONE WILL

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:45.226
ONE DAY BE. FEEL LIKE MEDICINE

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:47.095
HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND. I SAID

01:27:47.161 --> 01:27:48.262
THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR BEING

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:49.664
ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE A BIT OF

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.499
THAT POWER BACK. IT IS

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.601
IRONICALLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:56.004
REWARDING THINGS THAT I DO IN

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.506
MY MEDICAL PRACTICE. BEING A

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:01.976
PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR- IN I'D SAY

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.512
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.347
DELIVERING BABY IS AND WHO SOME

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:10.318
OF THE CONTRACT. CARE THAT YOU.

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:19.861
IT'S. ECHOING FEEL LIKE I'M

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.262
GONNA ASK A LOT OF THINGS HAVE

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.965
ALREADY COME UP- THE WAITING

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.700
PERIOD I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.368
PATIENTS EITHER CALM WHEN THEY

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.870
ARE TO THIS WHEN THEY ARE.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.672
PLANNING AHEAD. OF LIKE MY

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.740
FIRST PATIENT PERCIVAL. OVER

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.308
MANY OF MY PATIENTS OR WHEN

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:37.879
THEY ARE. REALLY TERMINAL- WHEN

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.281
THEY ARE ACTIVELY DYING AND YOU

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:42.050
CAN NOW YOU KNOW AS THE

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.918
PROVIDER WHEN YOU SEE THEM. OF

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.386
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:45.953
MAKE IT THROUGH THE WAITING

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.623
PERIOD. I AND ABOUT HALF MY

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.224
PATIENTS TELL. IF AND IF NOT A

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:53.361
pTHE EARLY DAYS AND NOW IT'S A

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:54.429
LITTLE BIT LESS THAN HALF I'D

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:58.066
SAY- SO THAT THAT IS ONE

01:28:58.132 --> 01:29:00.435
PARTICULAR BARRIER. ANOTHER ONE

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:03.237
IS ACCESS- PROVIDERS MANY

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.505
PROVIDERS EITHER ARE

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:06.374
COMFORTABLE OR WHEN I TALK WITH

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.141
THEM BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.676
TRAININGS WITH THE CLINICIANS

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:09.911
OTHER CLINICIANS AND CENTER

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:12.613
MEDICAL GROUP- THEY JUST. HAVE

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.117
THIS IDEA THAT ALL AGES HERE

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.853
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. AND

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.221
THEN I TRIED TO DISPEL FOR THEM

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:23.024
BREAK DOWN INTO LIKE. A REALLY

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.025
THAT COMPLICATED JUST TO

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:25.893
INFORMED CONSENT THIS GOT IN

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.899
WITH. LIKE IF EVERY NICHOLS.

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.434
AND HERE THEY STE. OF I'M FACT

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:34.736
FOR AS PRO SO A LOT OF MY

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.037
RESIDENTS ARE. VERY INTO. IN

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:38.573
THIS PROCESS AND OVER HALF OF

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.874
THEM ACTUALLY ARE TAKING PART

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:43.311
IN SEEING PATIENTS- AND SO THAT

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:44.345
HAS BEEN GREAT FOR TRAINING

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:46.147
THAT'S OUR NEXT GENERATION OF

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.917
PHYSICIANS- BUT ALSO. I THINK

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:51.152
WITH DOCTOR PATEL KIND OF

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.221
BROUGHT UP WHEN YOU GUYS WERE

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:55.423
TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE FIRST

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:56.724
VERBAL REQUEST WHICH YOU WOULD

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.259
THINK IS THE FIRST VERBAL TO

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.794
REQUEST WITH THE PATIENCE THING

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.262
IS THE FIRST VERBAL REQUEST IS

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.464
NOT ACTUALLY IN THE EYES OF THE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:04.866
LAW THE FIRST VERBAL REQUEST.

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.734
SO FROM MY STANDPOINT IN THE

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:09.103
LAW YOU HAVE TO BE SITTING IN

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.905
FRONT OF ME. AND TELL ME THAT

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:12.473
YOU WANT A MEDICATION TO HELP

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.575
YOU AND YOUR LIFE. AT THE

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:15.276
PATIENTS ALREADY SAID THAT

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.345
BEFORE. THEY SAID THAT TO THEIR

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:18.846
OWN PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR.

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.148
RELEASE SAID THAT TO THEIR

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:22.383
THEIR OWN ONCOLOGIST I'M DONE I

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:23.851
WANT THAT THAT DEATH WITH

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:26.187
DIGNITY THING. THEY'VE SAID

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.588
THAT ALREADY AND FREQUENTLY

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.023
THEY SAID THAT LIKE ONE OR TWO

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.225
MONTHS AGO ALREADY. AND THEN

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.527
THE ANSWER THAT THEY GRAVEL AS

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.362
WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.797
DO THAT OR YOU KNOW I DON'T

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.298
REALLY KNOW WHO YOU GO TO FOR

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:38.800
THAT. AND SO THEN THEY COME TO

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.268
ME AND THEY SAY WELL I'VE

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:40.802
ALREADY GIVEN THREE VERBAL

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:43.404
REQUESTS. THEY SAY WELL IN THE

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:43.905
EYES OF A LOT IT DIDN'T

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.873
ACTUALLY COUNT. SO THEN THEY

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.742
HAVE TO DO IN A- DIRECTIONAL.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:48.976
FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD WHEN

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.745
THEY'VE ACTUALLY IN. IN FACT

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.747
ALREADY BEEN WAITING. A COUPLE

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:55.516
OF MONTHS. SETS ONE BARRIER

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.485
ANOTHER BARRIER. AND THEN I'D

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:59.320
SAY THE THIRD THAT I JUST WANT

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.455
TO MENTION HIS. I GET A LOT OF

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:02.723
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO ME

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.625
FROM THREE FOUR HOURS AWAY.

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:05.960
FROM YOU I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:07.628
TO ME FOR ME OF SAMITY OR NEAR

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.397
THE OREGON BORDER BECAUSE THEY

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:10.998
DON'T HAVE SOMEONE CLOSER. AND

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.400
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE.

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.302
SUFFERING AND HAVE A LOT OF

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:17.338
PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS. A AND SO

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.273
MAKING THEM SCHLEP THEIR WAY

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.309
DOWN TO SACRAMENTO SO THAT THEY

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:23.444
CAN SIT WITH ME FOR THIRTY

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.146
MINUTES OR FORTY FIVE MINUTES.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:30.117
IS ALSO ON DECK. FIVE AND SO.

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.953
HAVE NOW. WE HAVE THESE ONE

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.821
DEVICES WE CAN HAVE A VIDEO

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:35.690
CONFERENCE WITH SOMEBODY. ALL

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:36.924
OF THEM ALSO HAVE THESE

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:39.861
WONDERFUL DEVICES. SO YOU CAN

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.996
HAVE A FACE TO FACE WITH

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.831
SOMEBODY IN THEIR BED IN THEIR

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.233
HOME WHERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:47.368
HAVE TO COME TO YOU AND UNDERGO

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:49.036
MORE SUFFERING JUST TO BE ABLE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.004
TO GET THIS THING THAT'S

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.138
POSSIBLY. LESSENING THEIR

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.641
SUFFERING. SO THAT'S ANOTHER

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.443
POTENTIAL LIMITATION IN ALL OF

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:57.311
THIS IS NOW WE HAVE THE

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:59.347
TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN VIEW

CURRENTLY THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:12.059
EXPLOSIVELY. ALLOWABLE AND IT'S

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.561
SOMETHING ANOTHER AREA WE CAN

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:18.532

CARE IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE VA

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.688

I HAVE NOT HAD ANY REFERRALS AT

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.462
THE VA BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:51.499
TO NOTE THAT HE WITH REFERRALS

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.469
MEDICARE HAS EXPLICITLY SAID

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:58.039
THAT YOU CAN BILL FOR THIS SO

01:32:58.105 --> 01:32:59.607

HAD VA PATIENTS AND WHAT

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:10.484
HAPPENS IS THEY CONTACT THEY DO

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.820
WHAT PEOPLE DO WHICH IS TO TRY

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.021
AND FIND OUT WHO IS IN THERE IN

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:16.190
THE CONCIERGE OR THE DIRECT

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.793
CARE WORLD THAT THEY CAN ACCESS

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:21.462
SO THE ACCESS BECOME FINANCIAL

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:24.966
BARRIER. AND THEN AND OR OR CAN

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:28.235
MAKE ACCESS IT THROUGH THEIR-

IN SOME OTHER WAY SO YOU CAN

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:31.906
GET ALL OF THE VISITS COVERED

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:33.708
BY MEDICARE BECAUSE THAT'S JUST

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:36.243
AND OF LIFE COUNSELING. SO ALL

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:37.745
THE VISITS CAN COUNT BUT AT THE

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.113
POINT WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION IS

WRITTEN THAT'S AN UNCOVERED

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.616

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:45.086
WORK AROUND HAS BEEN AS-

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:48.089
BECAUSE- THE LAW. INCLUDES END

LOOK TO DO WE KNOW IF DOCTORS

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:08.676
WITHIN THE VA SYSTEM ARE MAKING

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.644
PATIENTS- AWARE OF THE OPTION

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:12.880

ADDS THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:22.723
INTERESTING TO FIND OUT I MEAN

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:23.591
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT THAN OTHER

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:25.326
THINGS THAT HAVE A RESTAURANT

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:27.395

ACTUALLY KNOW. THE REGION I

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:40.908
REPRESENT THERE'S- VETERANS

ME MAYBE. A BETTER. OF JUST

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.425
PUBLIC EDUCATION SO THAT

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.160
THEY'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.695
LEARNING OF OPTIONS IN THEIR

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:12.666
LEVEL OF PART OF ONLY ONE OF

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:15.936
WHICH I FELT LIKE WAS NOT A

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:19.173
GOOD CANDIDATE- AND HAVING THE

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.075
SECOND PHYSICIAN THERE WAS KIND

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:24.545
OF NECESSARY TO CATCHING THAT

PATIENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE- BUT

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:32.052
IT DOES FACILITY THAT

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.154
CONVERSATION. I AGREE I THINK

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:38.759
THAT THE VISIT IS HELPFUL- I

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.594
DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:41.962
RIGHT NUMBER OF DISEASES IN

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.165
BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE VISITS OR-

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:44.832
HAVING THAT TWO SEPARATE

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.233
WITHOUT FIRST ATTENDING BUT I

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.669
THINK- I AGREE I THINK IN ALL

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.204
THE PATIENTS THAT I'VE SEEN-

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:52.239
HAD IT HAD THAT HASN'T BEEN THE

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:53.541
BARRIER BECAUSE WE CAN DO THOSE

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.976
VISITS ON THE SAME DAY BACK TO

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:58.612
BACK. BILLY THANK OPENING UP TO

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:00.147
OF VIDEO VISITS USING

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:03.184
TELEMEDICINE FOR RURAL AREAS OR

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:06.787
ACCESS ISSUES. IT OPENS MY MIND

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.923
I THINK AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:10.391
PRACTICE IN A MAJOR

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:13.027
METROPOLITAN AREA. WHERE ACCESS

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.461
IS A BIGGER ISSUE I THINK THAT

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.664
IT'S SHORT SIGHTED TO THINK.

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.299
THAT IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:20.067
WHERE THERE'S JUST ONE PERSON

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:23.470
PRESCRIBING ANY DON'T OPEN UP.

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:26.240
TO HAVING A SECOND MIND. AT

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:29.076
WORK SO. I DON'T I THINK IT'S A

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:30.244
GOOD IDEA YEAH AND IT'S REALLY

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:33.814
IMPORTANT FOR SIX THE SAFEGUARD

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:36.450
I'VE- RIGHT NOW STAY RAN I

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:37.918
THOUGHT TO IS GOOD BUT I THINK

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:39.820
THAT IT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.622
MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH-

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:44.058
TELEMEDICINE AND MAKE JUST

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.492
MAKING SURE THAT WE SAFEGUARD

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.695
THAT OPTION SO THAT THE PATIENT

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:51.131
RIGHTS IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT.

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.700
WE FOUND ARE NOT IN THE

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:53.701
METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE

01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:55.402
PROTECTED OTHERWISE IT REALLY

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:59.907
IS YOU KNOW. CITY OPTION AND

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:01.875
NOT A REAL OPTION AND HOW ABOUT

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:04.645
THE THIS THE IDEA OF THE FIRST

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.913
WE NEED TO BE THE ATTENDING

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.814
THAT'S COME UP A COUPLE TIMES

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.449
LIKE IF YOU'RE ATTENDING IS NOT

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:09.883
A PARTICIPANT AND WON'T REFER

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:12.186
YOU OFF SO SHOULD IT HAVE TO BE

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:13.921
AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN TO YOU.

01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:15.456
OR YOUR PHYSICIAN IS ABLE TO

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:16.624
GET VERY LITERALLY LIKE IT'S

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.526
CARRIED THEIR PHYSICIAN YEAH SO

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:21.996
THAT IS. PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:25.466
IN THE- BILL- BELIEVE IT'S IT

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:26.734
DEFINES THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.371
AS THE PHYSICIAN THAT HAS THE-

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:31.905
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:33.207
THE PATIENTS HEALTH CARE AN

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:34.908
UNDERLYING CONDITION. I'M

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:36.377
PARAPHRASING BUT THAT'S PRETTY

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:39.980
CLOSE TO WHAT THE LAW SAYS. AND

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:42.283
THAT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:44.618
SO MANY PEOPLE'S P. C. PEAS OR

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:45.886
ONCOLOGISTS OR WHOEVER IT IS

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.421
THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY PHYSICIAN

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:49.456
IS DOING THIS. AND SO THEN IF

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:51.191
THEY REFERRED TO ME IN A

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:51.792
MEETING FOR THEM FOR THE FIRST

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:54.295
TIME. YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:55.729
TAKE THE EXTRA TIME MAKE THEM

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:56.730
WAIT EVEN MORE FOR ME TO

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:58.032
ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.600
THEM BEFORE SAYING NOW I'M

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.101
ACCEPTING YOUR VERBAL REQUEST.

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:03.203
SO THAT THAT IS PROBLEMATIC

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.672
LANGUAGE AND IN THE BILL FROM

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:06.373
THAT WAS. WAS PART OF THE

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.776
NEGOTIATIONS TO GET IT TO GET

01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:09.743
IT DONE AS A SAFEGUARD YET

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:12.546
CENTER WALKING INTO. YEAH I

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.381
THINK THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.650
AN ORDER. SO IT THAT'S IN THE

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:18.419
IDEAL WORLD THAT'S WHAT IT IS

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.853
BUT MAYBE THIS IS OPPORTUNITY

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.222
FOR OR SO IF THE IF THE PATIENT

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.291
IF THE PHYSICIAN IS NON. UP

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.759
PARTICIPATING THAT IT COULD BE

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:27.961
OR F. IS A PARTICIPATING

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.064

RESIDENTS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:54.548
LOT MORE I MEAN DO YOU DO THIS

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:57.651
BECAUSE YOUR SYSTEM. REQUIRES

IT OR DO YOU DO THIS JUST

01:40:58.385 --> 01:41:01.121
BECAUSE- YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.256
AND THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:02.790
THING FOR THE RESIDENTS TO

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:08.562
LEARN. THE LATTER- SO ME AND MY

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.030
TWO TWO COLLEAGUES THAT I WORK

01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:12.966
WITH WHO ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:13.600
WE ACTUALLY SPENT ABOUT A YEAR

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.436
YEAR AND A HALF. KINDA LEARNING

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.037
THIS IN GOING TO PATIENTS AMONG

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:19.573
US OUT BEFORE WE EVEN OPENED IT

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.675
UP TO THE RESIDENCE HE FELT

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:24.578
COMFORTABLE- DOING IT THERE IS

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:25.879
THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKING FOR

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:29.249
IT- SO WE OPENED IT UP TO THAT

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:31.351
AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE ACT AS

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:32.586
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. AMONG

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:35.389
PATIENTS TO THE RESIDENCE

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:37.024
TEACHING THEM BUT ALSO KIND OF

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:39.059
GIVING THEM EXPERIENCE HANDS ON

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.861
EXPERIENCE WITH PATIENTS THAT

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:41.695
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN THEY

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:47.100
GRADUATE. HELLO PLEASE YES

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:48.335
CONTACT FAR I WAS JUST GONNA

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.303
SAY WE'VE BEEN TEACHING AT THIS.

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:50.070
FOR THE TEACHER OF FAIR

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.672
MEDICINE BECAUSE NEW YORK IS IN

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.474
US BUT HAS WRAPPED RAMPING UP

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.210
IN- COLORADO HAS BEEN THE

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:57.377
ANYONE WHO'S RECENTLY PASSED

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.613
HAS RESIDENCY PROGRAMS OF

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.881
COURSE OREGON HAS BEEN TEACHING

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.216
IN ITS PROGRAMS AND WASHINGTON.

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:03.851
SO WE'VE BEEN BAND TOGETHER TO

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:05.085
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE DO

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.120
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MEETS

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.556
THE CRITERIA FOR BEST PRACTICES

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:10.757
IN TEACHING SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:13.060
GOING ON AND BRIAN'S PER MINUTE

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.528
HE'S WORKED WITH SOME OF THOSE

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:16.396
PEOPLE AND IT'S OFFERED. SOME

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:18.699
OF THOSE MATERIALS STELLAR.

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:19.900
LIKE EVERY ELSE ONE OF THE BACK

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.168
BACK. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.903
FAMILY MEDICINE I DON'T THINK

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.271
THAT IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THAT

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:25.339
ONLY FAMILY PHYSICIANS ARE

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:27.274
PRESCRIBING THOUGH AT STANFORD-

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:28.809
NEUROLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.977
ONCOLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.812
IT'S VERY INDIVIDUAL HOW PEOPLE

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.514
SEE IT. WITHIN THEIR PRACTICE

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.949
IF YOU MOVE FROM HERE TO CARE

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:37.851
IF INDIVIDUALS SEE IT AS PART

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.887
OF THEIR PRACTICE SO I DON'T.

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.221
AND PALLIATIVE CARE LIKE SOME

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:42.356
OF THE PALLIATIVE CARE PEOPLE

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:45.025
ARE LEFT DON'T WANT TO DO IT

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.660
BUT SOME OF EMBRACE DEBT. AS

PROHIBITION ON THAT THAT LEVEL

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:42.162

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:09.523
NOT THE CASE. THAT THAT WHEN

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.056
THEY'RE PROVIDERS BECAME

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:12.859

THE PATIENTS THAT NEED IT. ONE

01:51:39.659 --> 01:51:47.333
THING I WILL SAY IS. THAT. AS A

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.268
PHYSICIAN SITTING HERE I AYE

AS AS HUMANS TO PATIENTS THAT

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:05.051
ACTUALLY NEEDED I LOOK AT

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:06.986
MADISON. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:08.555
HAVING INTERNET AFTER MY FATHER

01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:11.124
DIED IS NOT AS AS A PROFESSION

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:13.026

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:15.228
IF WE ARE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:17.664
THIS SERVICE OR THIS ASPECT OF

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.165
THE POSITION WE SHOULD BE

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.300
PROVIDING THIS TO ALL OF

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:21.634
PATIENTS AND ONE THING I'VE

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:22.869
REALIZED IS ABOUT A PHYSICIAN

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.971
IS THAT. THESE PATIENTS THAT

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:27.440
THAT OUR TERMINAL THAT ARE.

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:29.309
REALLY STRUGGLING EVERY DAY

01:52:29.375 --> 01:52:30.710
ONCE HEY ALLEGE A BALL AND

01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:33.513
HOSPICE. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES TO

THIS ACT THEY DON'T CHOOSE TO.

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:38.151
TO DO THIS JUST OUT OF THE BLUE

01:52:38.218 --> 01:52:40.420
IF PART ABOUT IT THE PART ABOUT

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:41.621
HOW THEY WANT TO DIE THEY DON'T

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.723

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.694
I'M AS PHYSICIANS I FEEL LIKE

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.597

IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WANT TO

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:53.133
PATIENTS TO DIE I THINK

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:54.767
PHYSICIANS HAVE A LOT OF

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:56.069
LEARNING TO DO AND GIVING UP.

01:52:56.136 --> 01:52:58.037
CONTROL PLAGUE. OR SUBJECT THE

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.305
PATIENTS DO THEIR VIEWS OF

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:01.608
INDIGNITY. MAN AT ONE OF THE

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:02.842
THINGS I FEEL IS THAT THESE

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:05.645
PATIENTS- THEY JUST WANT TO DIE

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:09.516
A PIECE THAT AND THAT IS WHAT

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.784

01:53:49.255 --> 01:53:50.924
AFTER THEY EDUCATE THEM ON THE

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.692
OFTEN WORK WITH PHYSICIANS TO

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:55.528

ALSO END OF LIFE EDUCATION. I

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.548
DON'T FEEL THAT WE SHOULD LET

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.784
ANYONE GO THROUGH THE MEDICAL

01:55:57.850 --> 01:56:00.086
EDUCATION SYSTEM WITHOUT

LEARNING AS MUCH ABOUT DEATH

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:04.857
AND DYING AS THE- ABOUT. GIVING

01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:07.460

MUCH ABOUT GIVING BIRTH. AND

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:16.769
WRITING DEATH CERTIFICATES THE

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:18.104
FAMOUS SO MUCH OF IT THAT'S IN

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:19.105
BETWEEN AND THAT'S WHY I PUT

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:20.773
THE MISSION THAT. WE SHOULD NOT

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.142
BE LETTING ANYONE DIE WITHOUT

END OF LIFE OPTION ACT PANEL

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:20.299
BUT ALSO NOT JUST STOP TALKING

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:22.335
ABOUT. EVERY ASPECT OF IN THE

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.337
FLY FROM SEVEN THIRTY IN THE

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:25.471
MORNING TO SIX THIRTY IN THE

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.306
EVENING. I WILL BE PROUD TO SAY

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:28.641
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.510
OF A MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:32.879
PEOPLE STILL SITTING THERE. AND

01:57:32.945 --> 01:57:34.580
PARTICIPATING IN THE SYMPOSIUM

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:35.481
TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS THAT

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:37.083
THE INSTITUTION HAS RECOGNIZED

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:39.886
ITS- ITS EXCELLENCE AND HAS

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.621
INDICTED NOW FOR FIVE YEARS. SO

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:42.822
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.424
CONVERSATION ON MULTIPLE BILLS.

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.892
AT IT IS OPEN EVERYONE ACROSS

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:48.828
THE NATION TO ATTEND- ONE OF

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:49.896
THE THINGS I FEEL VERY STRONGLY

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.197
AS A PHYSICIAN IS THAT THAT

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:53.299
THIS NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:55.668
AT THE RESIDENT. AND FELLOWS

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:57.103
LEVEL AS I WILL BE IMPLEMENTING

01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:59.338
IN MY OWN INSTITUTION. BUT IT

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:00.740
NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT AT THE LEVEL

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:02.842
OF MEDICAL STEEP. THESE ARE

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:05.978
PEOPLE THAT FEAR TRAINING. TO

01:58:06.045 --> 01:58:11.451
WORK HUMANS. AND THAT AND

01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:12.718
THERE'S REASON THAT I'M- STE.

01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:13.586
SHOULD NOT STOCK THE STE FROM

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:14.854
EARLY ON. THERE IS A DOES

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:16.155
HAVING THROUGH MANY SCHOOL A

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:18.057
DOES OF. REALLY CA. THAT

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.560
ACTUALLY EVEN. COVERS POSITIVE

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.662
OR END OF LIFE ISSUES I THINK

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:23.596
THAT'S SOMETHING MEDICAL

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:25.898
SCHOOLS AND THE SOCIETY SHOULD.

01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:27.633
STRONGLY LOOK AT. THE OTHER

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.535
THING I WILL SAY IS THAT I KNOW

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.537
LAST YEAR THE MEDICAL- BOARD

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:33.172
ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. SAID

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.074
THAT ANY PHYSICIAN WHO HAD A

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:37.076
LICENSE UP TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:38.377
SHOULD BE LOOKING TO GET AT

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:40.179
LEAST TWELVE- CREDITS OF

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:41.481
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND

01:58:41.547 --> 01:58:42.849
DEFLECTED GOV END OF LIFE

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.784
PATIENTS END OF LIFE CARE ALSO

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:47.620
IN TERMS OF OPIOIDS- I FEEL

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:49.088
LIKE WITH OUR SYMPOSIUM AND MY

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:51.290
TRAINING FOR. GUIDANCE FOR OUR

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:52.525
FELLOWS AND RESIDENTS WE ARE

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.660
MEETING THAT. BUT I THINK THIS

01:58:54.727 --> 01:58:56.295
IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:57.997
MANDATED AT ALL- ALL

01:58:58.064 --> 01:58:59.432
INSTITUTIONS- TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:59.499 --> 01:59:01.300
THEIR- THEIR PHYSICIANS

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.635
ACTUALLY HAVE THAT END OF LIFE

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.237
CARE TRAINING. I'M I FEEL AND

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.439
PHYSICIANS BE OFTEN GET SO BUSY

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:08.207
AND WRAPPED UP NOT ONLY VERY

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.076
PRACTICES THAT BEHALF BUT OUR

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:13.012
OWN PERSONAL FAMILY LIVES AND

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:14.914
REALLY. THAT THE DUTIES WE HAVE

01:59:14.981 --> 01:59:16.482
BESIDES BEING POSITIONS. I

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:19.852
THINK SOME OF THESE THINGS IF

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:23.122
THEY'RE NOT REALLY. MAN BY BY

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:25.191
IT REALLY LAW EVEN IS TO YOU.

01:59:25.258 --> 01:59:26.058
THEY WILL NEVER BE LOOKED AT

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:28.127
AND EVEN REMAIN SUBLET. ONLY TO

01:59:28.194 --> 01:59:30.563
THE PINNACLE THE ICE RUBIO I

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:34.200
FEEL THAT. WE AS AS A SOCIETY

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:35.668
IN TERMS OF THE THERE ARE

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:36.903
MULTIPLE BARRIERS THAT BEGIN

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:39.238
BEGIN- OVERCOME. I THINK

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:40.706
PROVIDE A PARTICIPATION IS A

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.174
BIG ISSUED MEANT INSTITUTION

01:59:42.241 --> 01:59:43.309
AND THAT'S A BIG ISSUE

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:45.378
ELSEWHERE I THINK EDUCATION

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:46.913
EDUCATION EDUCATION AND

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.848
COMPASSIONATE EDUCATION IS THE

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.017
KEY TO THAT- I HAVE OFTEN SAID

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.552
THAT THAT THAT THEIR SYMPOSIUM

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:54.487
I AM HAPPY TO PARTNER BUT- THE

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.088
GOVERNMENT'S THE STATE. WITH

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:57.123
THE REALLY ANYONE TO REALLY

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:58.391
TAKE THIS TO RURAL AREAS

01:59:58.457 --> 02:00:00.026
BECAUSE I DO SEE PATIENTS THAT

02:00:00.092 --> 02:00:02.328
COME FROM FAR AWAY THAT THAT DO

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:03.496
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:05.264
INFORMATION. AND PROVIDERS

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:06.365
DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS THE

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:07.433
PATIENTS WILL NEVER HAVE THAT

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.202
ACCESS OR OR INFORMATION- WE

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:11.904
BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW OUR

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:13.072
INSTITUTION AS BEHIND IN

02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:14.740
TELEHEALTH EXPLORING ABOUT

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:15.908
OPTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:17.677
BE OF BE LOOKING TO PUSH IN OUR

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:19.512
INSTITUTION AS WELL. THE OTHER

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:21.314
THING IS THERE HAS TO BE-

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.949
REALLY CULTURAL CHANGE WITH

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.850
EVERY INSTITUTION FACING THAT

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:26.085
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE FACED

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:27.987
WITH COMES BUT WITH PATIENTS

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.655
THAT HAVE PRO PROGNOSES AND

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.891
THAT A HOSPICE ELIGIBLE WHICH

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:33.593
IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA IS. UP

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:34.460
YOU HAVE TO START THIS

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:36.596
CONVERSATION AT THAT POINT AND

02:00:36.662 --> 02:00:37.830
NOT WHEN THEY HAVE. A FEW DAYS

02:00:37.897 --> 02:00:39.532
LEFT BECAUSE MOST OF THEM AS WE

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:42.068
SEE DO NOT EVEN GO THROUGH THE

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:42.702
PROCESS I CANNOT MAKE IT TO THE

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:47.473
PROCESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.875
ALSO NEEDS HAPPEN IS THE- I

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:52.278
THINK A V. ALL AS A AS A TEAM.

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:53.145
AS A TEAM IN THE TO DECIDE THAT

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:54.213
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.748
THAT JUST POSITION SHOULD BE

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.783
ALLOWED TO PRACTICE. THERE IS

02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:00.353
YET ANOTHER SET OF VISIT OF A

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:14.133
AND PRESCRIBERS. WE WILL

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.002
ACTUALLY EXPAND THE SCOPE IN

02:01:16.068 --> 02:01:17.803
THE HORIZON OF THIS LAW-

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:19.071

02:07:57.302 --> 02:07:59.238
WORK FLOWS WE HAVE CREATED

02:07:59.304 --> 02:08:01.273

THOSE THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE

02:08:59.932 --> 02:09:01.533
ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT THEY HAVE

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:02.067
COLLEAGUES WHO WILL ACCEPT

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:05.404
REFERRALS. BASED ON FEEDBACK

02:09:05.471 --> 02:09:06.405
WE'VE RECEIVED IN OUR

02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:07.606
EXPERIENCE TO DATE I'D LIKE TO

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:10.909
HIGHLIGHT FOR AREAS WHERE THERE

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:11.510
MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:13.779
CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST

02:09:13.846 --> 02:09:15.447
CHALLENGING AREA IS RELATED TO

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:17.583
ELIGIBILITY. THE CURRENT

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.585
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS CREATE

02:09:19.651 --> 02:09:21.653
LIMITATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.255
WITH NARROW GENERATIVE DISEASES

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:25.991
LIKE A ALAS. FINDING OPTIMAL

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:27.259
TIMING IN A SETTING OF

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:29.061
DECLINING MOTOR FUNCTION WHILE

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:30.762
STAYING TRUE TO THE REQUIREMENT

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:32.397
OF SELF ADMINISTRATION IS

02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:33.699
CHALLENGING FOR THIS POPULATION

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:36.735
OF PATIENTS. IN ADDITION WHILE

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:38.370
CAUTION IS CERTAINLY WARRANTED

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:39.638
FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM

02:09:39.705 --> 02:09:41.607
DEMENTIA THE LACK OF ABILITY OF

INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA TO

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:44.510
EXERCISE THIS OPTION IS AN

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.578
AREA. OF FRUSTRATION THAT WE

02:09:46.645 --> 02:09:48.313
HAVE HEARD IN ABUNDANCE AND IS

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.015
LIKELY INCREASE OVER TIME

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:53.919
GIVING OUR AGING POPULATION.

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:55.220
SECONDLY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.455
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:57.756
THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING HER

02:09:57.823 --> 02:09:58.924
HEAD FROM A LEGAL AND

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.993
LOGISTICAL PERSPECTIVE AS

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:02.995
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MULTIPLE-

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:04.763
OCCASIONS THIS MORNING OFTEN

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.331
PATIENTS THINK THE FIFTEEN DAY

02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:07.533
WAITING PERIOD STARTS WHEN THEY

02:10:07.599 --> 02:10:09.234
FIRST ASKED ABOUT THE OPTION

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:10.702
BUT THAT. IS NOT USUALLY THE

02:10:10.769 --> 02:10:12.371
CASE BECAUSE THE FIFTEEN DAY

02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:14.673
CLOCK DOESN'T START UNTIL THEY

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:15.274
ARE MEETING WITH THE ATTENDING

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:17.543
PHYSICIAN. IT CAN TAKE TIME TO

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:19.211
CONNECT THEM WITH THAT DOCTOR.

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.846
THIS CREATES STRESS AND ANXIETY

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:22.814
FOR THE PATIENT. ESPECIALLY IF

02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:24.950
THEIR HEALTH IS IN DECLINE. OUR

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:26.051
PATIENT COORDINATORS TELL

02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:28.587
PATIENTS IT WILL TYPICALLY TAKE

IN OREGON WHEN THE STATE WHEN

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:51.302
THE WHEN THE LAW PASSED IN

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:53.337
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE WERE

02:31:53.404 --> 02:31:54.672
REALLY ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF IT.

02:31:54.738 --> 02:31:57.408
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:59.009
DID WAS WE DID CHANGE OUR

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:00.411

02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:03.747

02:32:03.814 --> 02:32:06.250
STRONG PATIENT ADVOCATES AT THE

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:12.189
WE SAT TOGETHER AND WE LOOKED

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:14.291
AT THE CURRENT PROTOCOL THAT WE

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:15.693
HAD FOR OREGON AND DECIDED THAT

02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:18.863

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:19.463
OF HONORING LIFE AND OFFERING

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.532
HOPE. AND SO WE REALLY CREATE

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:23.767
ED A PROTOCOL THAT WAS KIND OF

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:25.703
UNIQUE AT THE TIME AND I'M

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:26.470

02:32:28.005 --> 02:32:29.640
ARE CHANGING IN LINE WITH THAT.

02:32:29.707 --> 02:32:31.108
SO THE THREE DISTINCT ELEMENTS

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:32.877
OF OUR PROTOCOL WERE THAT. THEY

02:32:32.943 --> 02:32:34.879
HAD TO INVOLVE THEIR NDP THAT'S

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:35.846
THEIR NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF

02:32:35.913 --> 02:32:38.015
PATIENT EXPERIENCE SO. THAT

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:39.717
INDIVIDUAL IS. A PATIENT

02:32:39.783 --> 02:32:41.218
EXPERIENCE FOR US IS EVERYTHING

02:32:41.285 --> 02:32:42.553
PSYCHO SOCIAL AND ETHICS

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:44.355
RELATED. SO THEY HAD TO INVOLVE

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:45.923
THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEY HAVE

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.491
TO INVOLVE THE REGIONAL HOSPICE

02:32:47.558 --> 02:32:48.225
MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:49.760
REASONS FOR THAT WAS BOTH TO

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:51.662
SUPPORT THE STAFF. TO MAINTAIN

02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:53.797
STATISTICS RELATED TO HOW MANY

02:32:53.864 --> 02:32:56.000
PATIENTS PURSUED TO THE ACT IN

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:57.835
ANY AT ANY STOP ON THE JOURNEY.

02:32:57.902 --> 02:32:59.904
AND ALSO TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:01.705
THE LEADERSHIP. THE SECOND IS

02:33:01.772 --> 02:33:03.307
AS WE DO ALLOW OUR PHYSICIANS

02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:04.475
TO ACT AS ATTENDING OR

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:06.210
CONSULTING'S BY LAW IF THEY SO

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:09.246
CHOOSE. ON THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN

02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:10.781
OUR CASE SINCE THE LAW WAS

02:33:10.848 --> 02:33:12.383
PASSED IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:33:12.449 --> 02:33:13.984
ACTUALLY JUST PRIOR TO ITS

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:15.786
PASSING IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:18.022
IS THAT WE ALLOW OUR STAFF TO

02:33:18.088 --> 02:33:19.089
BE PRESENT AT TIME OF

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:22.560
INGESTION. IT FELT VERY AWKWARD

02:33:22.626 --> 02:33:24.662
TO HAVE STOPPED STEP AWAY AT

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:25.896
THE TIME OF INGESTION AND THEN

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:27.932
BE TOLD IT'S OKAY YOU CAN GO

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:29.600
BACK INTO PER EVENING NOW. SO

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:30.768
WE'VE WE'VE ALLOWED OUR STAFF

02:33:30.834 --> 02:33:31.635
TO BE PRESENT AT TIME OF

02:33:31.702 --> 02:33:33.137
INGESTION ONE OF THE THINGS

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.338
THAT WE'VE NOTICED THAT JUST

02:33:34.405 --> 02:33:36.473
CHANGED SINCE THE LAST HEARING.

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:37.975
IS THAT OUR STAFF HAS BECOME

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.476
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:41.111
OFFERING TRUE INFORMED CONSENT.

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.413
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:44.315
THAT YOU CAN'T INITIATE THE

02:33:44.381 --> 02:33:45.683
DIALOGUE WE ALLOW THEM TO

02:33:45.749 --> 02:33:46.884
INITIATE THE DIALOGUE AROUND

02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:50.220
CHOICES- AND THEN. KNOWING THAT

02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:51.789
THEY CAN NUMBER FOR THAT BACK

02:33:51.855 --> 02:33:53.157
TO THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WHO

02:33:53.223 --> 02:33:54.625
WILL THAT AND WALK THEM THROUGH

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:55.993
ITS ACTUALLY. REASONABLE FOR

02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:57.995
THEM SO THEY WILL SHARE CHOICES

02:33:58.062 --> 02:34:00.531
LIKE- PALLIATIVE SEDATION IF

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.632
IT'S MEDICALLY INDICATED THEY

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:03.367
WILL SHARE CHOICES LIKE V. SIDE

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:04.969
VOLUNTARY STOPPING OF EATING

02:34:05.035 --> 02:34:06.036
AND DRINKING THEY WILL SHARE.

02:34:06.103 --> 02:34:08.172
AND OF LIFE OPTIONS ACT WITH

02:34:08.238 --> 02:34:09.273
THE PATIENTS SO THAT THEY

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:10.641
REALLY UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:11.609
WILL BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT

02:34:11.675 --> 02:34:12.810
THAT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.345
LAW AROUND THE NEXT OF KIN NOT

02:34:14.411 --> 02:34:16.046
KNOWING. NECESSARILY WITHOUT

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:17.881
PERMITS EXPLICIT PERMISSION

02:34:17.948 --> 02:34:19.583
FROM THE PATIENT. WE STARTED

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.485
EARLY EDUCATION ROLL OUT BEFORE

02:34:21.552 --> 02:34:22.820
THE LAW WAS IMPLEMENTED IN

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:24.221
CALIFORNIA AND WE LEARNED

02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:26.624
ANOTHER UNIQUE THING. HOW WE AS

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:28.292
LEADERS PRESENTED THE LAW. MADE

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:30.194
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:33.063
PRESENTATION AND HOW ARE STAFF.

02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:34.765
RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION AND

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:37.167
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THE

02:34:37.234 --> 02:34:40.137
LAST HEARING IS WE HAVE OUR OF.

02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:43.173
OUR RIGHTS STATEMENT. AND THEN

02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:44.408
THREE SPECIFIC TASKS THAT ARE

02:34:44.475 --> 02:34:46.043
AT THE START AND FRAMEWORK OF

02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.845
EVERY EDUCATION SESSION. THE

02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:49.513
STATEMENT IS THIS IS A DIVISIVE

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:53.283
TOPIC. CLEAR BUT WE ARE

02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:53.884
ADDRESSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.220
ROOM. AND THE THREE ELEMENTS

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:58.555
THAT WE REQUIRE IS THAT THEY

02:34:58.622 --> 02:34:59.857
KNOW THE LAW OF THE STATE THAT

02:34:59.923 --> 02:35:02.526
THEY'RE IN. THAT THEY KNOW OUR

02:35:02.593 --> 02:35:04.128
PROTOCOL AND UNDERSTAND OUR

02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:05.629
PROTOCOL INCLUDING ITS

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:08.766
LIMITATIONS. AND THAT THEY

02:35:08.832 --> 02:35:10.334
DEMONSTRATE HUMILITY.

02:35:10.401 --> 02:35:12.469
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY AS A

02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:14.838
STAFF MEMBER STAND ON NOT LAW

02:35:14.905 --> 02:35:16.407
TO BE GOOD SUPPORTS FOR EACH

02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.609
OTHER AS COLLEAGUES BECAUSE

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:19.977
THERE ARE OTHER DIVISIVE TOPICS

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:22.212
THAT WE HAVE AND WE EXPERIENCE

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:23.414
AND HOSPICE CARE AND SO THE

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:24.915
SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT AND

02:35:24.982 --> 02:35:26.116
WE'VE NOTICED A TREMENDOUS

02:35:26.183 --> 02:35:28.318
SHIFT IN HOW THE EDUCATION IS

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:29.887
RECEIVED. AND WE'VE NOTICED

02:35:29.953 --> 02:35:31.488
THAT MANY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS

02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:32.923
WE HAVE CHAMPIONS OF OUR SITES

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:35.059
THAT JUST BECOME THE EXPERTS IN

02:35:35.125 --> 02:35:36.660
KNOWING WHAT THE LAW STATES

02:35:36.727 --> 02:35:38.395
WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS BECAUSE

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:40.664
EVEN SOME OF THEM WHO ARE NOT

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:42.700
PARTICIPATING- BECAUSE THEY

02:35:42.766 --> 02:35:44.802
FEEL LIKE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:46.437
PIECE OF THE HUMILITY AND BEING

02:35:46.503 --> 02:35:51.308
A GOOD TEAM MEMBER. AB IN OUR

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:53.777
CURRENT STATE SINCE TWENTY

02:35:53.844 --> 02:35:57.347
SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE HAD A

02:35:57.414 --> 02:35:57.815
HUNDRED PATIENTS AVAIL

02:35:57.881 --> 02:36:00.017
THEMSELVES OF THE LAW AND MANY

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:00.784
MORE THAT HAVE JOURNEYED

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:03.987
THROUGH- AT VARIOUS PHASES LIKE

02:36:04.054 --> 02:36:05.556
MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID A LOT OF

02:36:05.622 --> 02:36:07.458
OUR CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO

02:36:07.524 --> 02:36:10.561
ACCESS AN- HOUR EVEN ARE

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:11.962
EDUCATION INCLUDE OUR VERY

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:13.464
FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS ACTUALLY A

02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:15.399
PATIENT IN OREGON. WHO WAS

02:36:15.466 --> 02:36:17.634
APART WAS UNDER HOSPICE

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:19.870
AGENCIES CARE NOT OUR OWN WHEN

02:36:19.937 --> 02:36:22.272
THEY WALKED HER THROUGH THE LAW

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:23.507
THEY TOOK HER ALL THE WAY TO

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:24.575
THE POINT OF WRITING A

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:28.378
PRESCRIPTION AND THEN THEY

02:36:28.445 --> 02:36:29.079
DROPPED HER FROM SERVICE. AND

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:31.648
OUR TEAM IT WAS OUR VERY FIRST

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:32.850
EXPERIENCE IN OUR TEAM DIDN'T

02:36:32.916 --> 02:36:34.118
QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WE DID

02:36:34.184 --> 02:36:35.686
HAVE A PROPER PROTOCOL IN PLACE

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:37.521
BUT FIRST EXPERIENCES CAN BE A

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:40.257
LITTLE ROCKY. AND THEY WERE

02:36:40.324 --> 02:36:41.492
ABLE TO WALK HER THROUGH THE

02:36:41.558 --> 02:36:43.427
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN THAT HAD

02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:45.462
WRITTEN THE SCRIPT FOR HER. AB

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:46.530
WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:49.032
DETAILS WAS TOLD BY THE AGENCY

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:50.934
THAT IF YOU WRITE TO THE SCRIPT

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.903
AND PURSUE AND CONTINUE THIS.

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:54.571
YOU WILL BE TERMINATED FROM

02:36:54.638 --> 02:36:56.807
EMPLOYMENT. AND HE RESIGNED ON

02:36:56.874 --> 02:36:59.209
THE SPOT AND WALKED OUT. AND SO

02:36:59.276 --> 02:37:00.978
HE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE THE

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:02.079
PROCESS WITH US AND WE WERE

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:03.747
VERY LUCKY BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:05.182
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:37:05.249 --> 02:37:06.984
CONTINUE THE PROCESS WHAT WAS

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:08.552
SAD AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:10.921
EXPERIENCE WAS. AND MANY OF

02:37:10.988 --> 02:37:12.022
SAID IF THERE WAS SOME

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:14.458
RECIPROCITY OR SOME PORTABILITY

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:16.693
FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT IT

02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:17.895
COULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE

02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:20.197
SHE REALLY WANTED THE SOCIAL

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:22.800
WORKER AND THE CHAPLAIN AND THE

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:23.901
NURSE THAT SHE HAD BEOME CLOSE

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:25.002
TO IN THE OTHER AGENCY TO BE

02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:27.271
PRESENT. SHE EIGHT ZERO

02:37:27.337 --> 02:37:28.172
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STAFF

02:37:28.238 --> 02:37:30.607
MEMBERS WHEN SHE CAME ON BOARD

02:37:30.674 --> 02:37:32.442
AND VERY LITTLE TIME. TO TRULY

02:37:32.509 --> 02:37:34.144
BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE LAW AND

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:36.013
SO IN PLACE WHAT SHE DID WAS

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:37.281
SHE EXT LEAST ACCEPTED OUR

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:39.183
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND A

02:37:39.249 --> 02:37:41.852
CLINICAL DIRECTOR TO BE PRESENT

02:37:41.919 --> 02:37:42.820
AT BEDSIDE BUT MISSED THE OTHER

02:37:42.886 --> 02:37:47.024
ELEMENTS AND ATOMS HER PLEA.

02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:47.658
AND SO IT WAS SOMETHING WE HAD

02:37:47.724 --> 02:37:49.193
LOW AROUND. OUR PRESENCE OUR

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:50.627
PRESENCE FROM THE BEGINNING

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.629
THROUGH TO THE END. AND ALSO

02:37:52.696 --> 02:37:54.498
OUR INVOLVEMENT IN ENGAGEMENT

02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:56.433
WITH MANY OTHER AGENCIES CROSS

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:58.235
COLLABORATING INTRA. AGENCY AS

02:37:58.302 --> 02:38:02.406
WELL. AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:38:02.472 --> 02:38:05.008
ACCESS ISSUES ARE STILL A

02:38:05.075 --> 02:38:06.743
COMMON HOSPICE ISSUE IT'S NOT A

02:38:06.810 --> 02:38:08.979
SPECIFIC ISSUE TO THE LAW IT'S

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:09.947
THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IS

02:38:10.013 --> 02:38:11.481
STILL VERY SHORT. HOSPICE

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:13.450
REFERRALS ARE COMING TOO LATE

02:38:13.517 --> 02:38:16.520
SO IF A HOSPITAL SYSTEM OR A

02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:18.222
PHYSICIAN IS NOT PARTICIPATING.

02:38:18.288 --> 02:38:20.157
THEY'RE REFERRING THE PATIENT

02:38:20.224 --> 02:38:21.892
FAR LEADER THAT NOT FIFTEEN DAY

02:38:21.959 --> 02:38:23.894
WINDOW MAY ALLOW THEM TO

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:27.564
PROCESS THROUGH. AND THERE IS A

02:38:27.631 --> 02:38:29.333
LACK OF PROVIDERS SO WE ARE

02:38:29.399 --> 02:38:31.568
VERY FORTUNATE WE HAVE A NUMBER

02:38:31.635 --> 02:38:33.103
OF OUR PHYSICIANS WHO ARE BOTH

02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:35.038
ATTENDING AND CONSULTING BY

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:37.507
LAW. AND UNTIL WE STARTED USING

02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:39.276
TELEMEDICINE FOR THE CONSULTING

02:38:39.343 --> 02:38:41.311
PIECE THEY WERE FLYING ALL

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:43.080
ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE

02:38:43.146 --> 02:38:45.115
THESE PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO

02:38:45.182 --> 02:38:47.050
TAKE WITHIN THEIR TIMELINE BUT

02:38:47.117 --> 02:38:49.086
THEN WHAT THEY ARE SORT OF

02:38:49.152 --> 02:38:50.487
PERFECT END OF LIFE EXPERIENCE

02:38:50.554 --> 02:38:51.588
RENT OF LIFE. HE WOULD LOOK

02:38:51.655 --> 02:38:54.224
LIKE. AND THEN THE FINANCIAL

02:38:54.291 --> 02:38:55.759
AND BILLING WHICH CONTINUES TO

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:58.295
CAUSE SOME SOCIAL INEQUITIES.

02:38:58.362 --> 02:39:00.397
HAS BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING FOR

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:01.365
A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS AND

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:03.100
FAMILIES THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:39:03.166 --> 02:39:04.468
LIMITATIONS OF OUR PROTOCOL

02:39:04.534 --> 02:39:05.903
THAT WE SHARE. THAT WE TALK

02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:07.337
ABOUT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ON

02:39:07.404 --> 02:39:08.972
OCCASION WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:39:09.039 --> 02:39:10.374
AGENCIES BEING ABLE TO CALL

WHILE THE DOCTORS WERE. THEY

02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:56.513
WERE JUST WAITING FOR PATIENTS

02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:57.381
TO BRING AN OFFENSE BUT NOW

02:40:57.447 --> 02:41:00.784
THEY CAN AND NOW THEY DO- YES

02:41:00.851 --> 02:41:01.618
NO WAY I DO WANT TO CLARIFY

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.487
THAT IN THAT IS PART OF IS WE

02:41:03.553 --> 02:41:05.522
DISCUSSED DURING THE PHYSICIAN

02:41:05.589 --> 02:41:08.325
TRAINING. SOME WHO OPT OUT DO

02:41:08.392 --> 02:41:09.659
THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION MORAL

02:41:09.726 --> 02:41:13.130
OBLIGATION TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE.

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:14.765
THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A LEGAL

02:41:14.831 --> 02:41:17.167
OBLIGATION IN IN THE LAW AS

WRITTEN TODAY BUT IT'S

02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:19.870
SOMETHING THAT I THINKS BEING

02:41:19.936 --> 02:41:22.205
LOOKED AT AND IF A DOCTOR IS

02:41:22.272 --> 02:41:24.041

WHO IS IMPORTANT. IT'S BEEN MY

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:30.547
EXPERIENCE IS THAT OUR DOCTORS

02:41:30.614 --> 02:41:33.717
DON'T WITHHOLD. IN THAT

02:41:33.784 --> 02:41:35.052

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:50.834
EMBARRASSED. THAT I WANT TO

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:53.770
BRING IT UP. THEY DON'T WANT TO

02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:54.638
TALK ABOUT IT THEY FEEL LIKE

02:41:54.704 --> 02:41:55.572
THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE CAUSE

02:41:55.639 --> 02:41:57.674
OF THEIR PARENTS TO DIE OR

02:41:57.741 --> 02:41:59.142

COMPANY DOESN'T BASED AND THE

LIFE OPTION ACT. SO IT'S

02:42:18.195 --> 02:42:19.362
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WE CAN

02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:20.864

MOVE THE LEGISLATION THROUGH I

02:42:43.019 --> 02:42:44.888

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:52.696
LEAST ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT.

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:55.031
THERE'S BEEN GREATER UPTAKE. IN

FACILITIES. THE FACILITY WERE

02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:36.126
NOT INFORMED. BECAUSE IT'S THE

02:45:36.192 --> 02:45:39.062
LAW THAT THE PATIENT THE PAGE

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:42.399
IS THE PATIENTS. IT IS THERE

02:45:42.465 --> 02:45:44.167
IT'S THEIR RIGHT THEY DON'T

02:45:44.234 --> 02:45:45.935
HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY THEY COULD

02:45:46.002 --> 02:45:47.270
TAKE THAT MEDISAVE MEDICATION

02:45:47.337 --> 02:45:49.539
ONCE THEY GET IT AND HAVE IT IN

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:50.106

PROTOCOLS AROUND FEEDING

02:46:11.227 --> 02:46:12.829
PATIENTS. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT

02:46:12.896 --> 02:46:14.731
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INNOCENT

02:46:14.798 --> 02:46:16.499
ORDER FOR A PATIENT TO BE ABLE

HIS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY. DOCTORS

02:48:56.259 --> 02:48:58.628
DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF

02:48:58.695 --> 02:49:01.097

02:49:01.164 --> 02:49:02.565
OUR OPTIMISM OF ITS FULL

02:49:06.269 --> 02:49:08.171
UNTREATABLE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION

02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:10.006
CAUSED BY A RAPIDLY GROWING

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:11.541
TUMOR THAT HAD INFESTED HIS

02:49:11.608 --> 02:49:14.644
ABDOMEN. WE HAD JUST WATCHED

HE WOULD NEVER EAT AGAIN. HE

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:23.786
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TUBE

TRAINING FECAL MATTER FROM HIS

THROAT AND OUT OF HIS NOSE. WE

02:49:28.157 --> 02:49:31.194
KNEW HE WOULD BE TORTURED. AND

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:39.969
TORTURED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:41.437
HE WOULD NEVER XP FAVORITE

WOULDN'T CLOSE. I DON'T WANT TO

02:49:52.582 --> 02:49:54.851
DIE LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER CHRIS

02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:57.554
CALMLY TOLD ME. I DON'T WANT TO

WANTED DIET ON MY OWN STE. HE

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:09.499
DID NOT WANT TO DIE. HE

02:50:09.566 --> 02:50:11.234
EXPRESSED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IN

02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:12.535
NOT HAVING TIME TO DO THE

02:50:12.602 --> 02:50:14.771
THINGS HE WANTED. HOWEVER HE

02:50:14.837 --> 02:50:16.739
KNEW HIS MORTALITY WAS IMMINENT

02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:18.074
AND HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO

02:50:18.141 --> 02:50:20.643
SUFFER UNNECESSARILY. HIS

02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:22.278
REQUEST WAS NOT OUT OF THE

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:24.714
ORDINARY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT

02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:27.250
WANT TO DIE IN IN.

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.786
UNFORTUNATELY MY HUSBAND DIED

02:50:29.852 --> 02:50:33.256
EXACTLY HOW HE FEARED MOST WITH

02:50:33.323 --> 02:50:34.090
TWO TWENTY VARIOUS BODILY

STOMACH KIDNEYS AND TRUST. THE

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:40.330
PAIN HE ENTERED WAS

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:42.565
UNFATHOMABLE. A SIMPLE SHIFTING

02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:46.669
MOVEMENT OR ACCIDENTAL BUMP. TO

02:50:46.736 --> 02:50:48.638

SWOLLEN SKIN WERE BURSTING OPEN

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:53.610
FROM THE PRESSURE MEDINA. CHRIS

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:55.578

FINAL DAYS SO YOU COULD DIE

DOCTORS TOLD CHRIS HE HAD LESS

02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:22.038
THAN TWO WEEKS TO LIVE. THAT

02:51:22.105 --> 02:51:23.306
MEANT HE WOULD NOT SURVIVE THE

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:24.574
MINIMUM FIFTEEN DAY WAITING

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:26.075
PERIOD BETWEEN THE FIRST AND

SECOND VERBAL REQUESTS FOR

FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS AND OF

02:51:33.449 --> 02:51:35.418
LIFE CARE. MY HUSBAND WAS

02:51:35.485 --> 02:51:37.854
DENIED OF LIFE. AND THE

PEACEFUL DEATH. HE IS NOT AN

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.557
ANOMALY I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER

SUFFERING RIGHT NOW AND BEING

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:45.028
DENIED THIS HUMAN RIGHT IN MY

02:51:45.094 --> 02:51:47.830
OPINION. MORE THAN THREE OUT OF

02:51:47.897 --> 02:51:49.265
FOUR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THE

02:51:49.332 --> 02:51:50.767
END OF LIFE OPTION ACT

02:51:50.833 --> 02:51:52.402
ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND

02:51:52.468 --> 02:51:53.703
FIFTEEN POLL BY THE INSTITUTE

02:51:53.770 --> 02:51:55.505
OF GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES AT THE

02:51:55.571 --> 02:51:56.472
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:51:56.539 --> 02:51:58.808
BERKELEY. HOWEVER THERE ARE TOO

02:51:58.875 --> 02:52:00.276
MANY ROAD BLOCKS FROM ANY DYING

02:52:00.343 --> 02:52:01.978
CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THIS

02:52:02.045 --> 02:52:04.147
LAW. SOME DOCTORS DO NOT INFORM

02:52:04.213 --> 02:52:06.215
THEIR PATIENTS OF ALL OF THEIR

02:52:06.282 --> 02:52:07.717
END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND THERE

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:09.752
ARE STILL TOO MANY ROBOTS TO

02:52:09.819 --> 02:52:11.521
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:13.022
CALIFORNIANS TO DIE PEACEFULLY.

02:52:13.089 --> 02:52:15.658
FINDING A SUPPORT OF DOCTOR OR

02:52:15.725 --> 02:52:16.125
FACILITY IS ESPECIALLY

02:52:16.192 --> 02:52:17.560
CHALLENGING DEPENDING ON WHERE

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:20.229
YOU LIVE. AND BY LAW. NO

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:22.565
SERVICE TO THE- HOSPITAL'S MAY

02:52:22.632 --> 02:52:24.100
ALSO PROHIBIT THEIR DOCTORS

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:25.234
AFFILIATED WITH THEM FROM

02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:27.603
PARTICIPATING IN THE LAW. AS

02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:29.005
EITHER AN ATTENDING OR

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:30.873
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN. A

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:32.475
RELIGIOUS HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN

02:52:32.542 --> 02:52:34.510
CALIFORNIA TREATING CHRIS IS

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:36.446
ONE OF MANY FACE BY FAITH BASED

02:52:36.512 --> 02:52:37.513
HOSPITALS IN THE STATE THAT

02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:39.615
PROHIBITS DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE

02:52:39.682 --> 02:52:41.350
MEDICAL AID IN DYING. THIS

02:52:41.417 --> 02:52:42.652
HOSPITAL REFERRED US TO A

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:44.020
HOSPICE IT BELIEVED WOULD BE

02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:45.688
WILLING TO PRESCRIBE MEDICAL

02:52:45.755 --> 02:52:47.724
AID IN DYING. HOWEVER THE

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:49.692
HOSPICE MISINFORMED US BY

02:52:49.759 --> 02:52:51.694
WRONGLY SAYING IT WAS ILLEGAL

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:53.696
IN CALIFORNIA AND CONTRADICTED

02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:55.631
ITSELF BY SAYING THE ONLY A

02:52:55.698 --> 02:52:57.467
DOCTOR IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:52:57.533 --> 02:52:58.434
COULD OFFER TO WRITE THIS

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:00.269
PRESCRIPTION. ALL OF THIS

02:53:00.336 --> 02:53:02.772
INFORMATION WAS SIMPLY WRONG

02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:05.475
AND IN TRUE. THEY ALSO SAID HE

02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:06.709
WOULD MOST LIKELY NEED TO SIX

02:53:06.776 --> 02:53:08.811
MONTHS TO COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE

02:53:08.878 --> 02:53:10.813
PROCESS WHEN IN FACT A PATIENT

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:13.049
CAN GET THROUGH THE PROCESS IN

02:53:13.116 --> 02:53:15.118
A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN DAYS. THAT

02:53:15.184 --> 02:53:16.319
FIFTEEN DAYS OF THE SUFFERING

02:53:16.385 --> 02:53:17.987
MY HUSBAND ENTERED IS STILL TOO

02:53:18.054 --> 02:53:22.158
LONG. FIFTEEN DAYS OF PAIN THAT

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:23.826
CANNOT BE CONTROLLED BY THE

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:24.560
HIGHEST NICK RECORDED

02:53:24.627 --> 02:53:26.662
MEDICATION AND HIM BEGGING TO

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:29.532
GO HOME IT'S TOO LONG. HE DID

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.234
NOT HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:33.136
THAT LINK THE PROCESS AND HE

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:34.337
WANTED TO SPEND HIS LAST DAYS

02:53:34.403 --> 02:53:36.973
IN PEACE HOLDING MY HAND AS I

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.107
TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM.

02:53:38.174 --> 02:53:40.676
I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT DOCTORS

02:53:40.743 --> 02:53:42.278
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOSPICES

02:53:42.345 --> 02:53:44.647
SHOULD INITIATE CONVERSATIONS

02:53:44.714 --> 02:53:45.648
TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE

02:53:45.715 --> 02:53:47.683
FULLY INFORMED OF ALL OF THEIR

02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:49.786
END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND FULLY

02:53:49.852 --> 02:53:51.487
SUPPORTED IN THEIR VISION

02:53:51.554 --> 02:53:54.657

LOVED ME. HE LIVED HELP PEOPLE

02:53:56.893 --> 02:53:59.428
IN NEED. BUT HE WAS DENIED. HE

02:53:59.495 --> 02:54:00.797
MAINTAINED A WILL POWER THAT

02:54:00.863 --> 02:54:02.465
COULD NOT BE SHATTERED BY THE

02:54:02.532 --> 02:54:03.499
AGONIZING DEATH THAT OFTEN

02:54:03.566 --> 02:54:05.034
ACCOMPANIES AGGRESSIVE

02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:07.970
METASTATIC CANCER. LIFE AND

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:09.605
DEATH ARE ONE THEIR INTEGRAL TO

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:12.041
EACH OTHER. WHEN HOW ONE LIVES

02:54:12.108 --> 02:54:13.743
TO LEAVE THIS EARTH IS HIGHLY

02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:16.579
PERSONAL. WATCHING THE LOVE OF

02:54:30.893 --> 02:54:33.629
WAY. NO ONE SHOULD. AND ALONE

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:34.797

PLANNED TO MAKE WHEN HE TOOK

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:27.797
THE MEDICAID'S AND- IT WAS. I

02:58:27.863 --> 02:58:29.398
AM TAKING THIS MEDICATION TO

02:58:29.465 --> 02:58:31.167
AVOID A MANNER OF LIVING THAT

02:58:31.233 --> 02:58:33.135
IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A MEETING

02:58:33.202 --> 02:58:35.371
FULL HUMAN LIFE. THIS STATEMENT

02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:38.074
BECAME INVALUABLE TO US IT WAS

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:40.209
OUR SHARED LANGUAGE BASED ON

02:58:40.276 --> 02:58:42.978
HIS VALUES WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT

02:58:43.045 --> 02:58:44.547
A MEANINGFUL HUMAN LIFE MEANT

02:58:44.613 --> 02:58:46.515
TO HIM. WE EXPLORED WHAT HE

02:58:46.582 --> 02:58:48.350
FELT HE NEEDED TO COMPLETE IN

02:58:48.417 --> 02:58:49.952
HIS LIFE BEFORE TAKING THE

02:58:50.019 --> 02:58:52.321
MEDICATION WE PLANNED WHO HE

02:58:52.388 --> 02:58:54.590
WOULD WANT IN THE ROOM WHEN HE

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:55.758
TOOK IT. AND AS HE AND WORK

02:58:55.825 --> 02:58:57.993
MORE TAX OF HIS OWN. WE ASKED

02:58:58.060 --> 02:58:59.728
HIM IF HIS CONDITION WAS

02:58:59.795 --> 02:59:02.298
UNACCEPTABLE YET. ONE OF THE

02:59:02.364 --> 02:59:03.732
MOST FASCINATING THINGS IS THAT

02:59:03.799 --> 02:59:07.103
FINISH LINE KEPT MOVING HIM.

02:59:07.169 --> 02:59:08.370
THE PRESENCE OF THE MEDICAID IN

02:59:08.437 --> 02:59:10.306
HIS HOME AND THE OPTION TO TAKE

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:12.274
IT WERE EXTRAORDINARILY

02:59:12.341 --> 02:59:14.076
MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT TO MY

02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:16.011
THAT. IT GAVE HIM PEACE OF

02:59:16.078 --> 02:59:19.081
MIND. IT ALLEVIATED HIS FEAR

02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:21.117
AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE PAIN AND

02:59:21.183 --> 02:59:23.119
SUFFERING HE WOULD BE FORCED TO

02:59:23.185 --> 02:59:24.854
INDOOR WITHOUT THE MEDICATION

02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:27.156
AND- AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS

02:59:27.223 --> 02:59:29.291
LOSING POWER AND CONTROL. OVER

02:59:29.358 --> 02:59:32.128
EVERYTHING. DAD BUT EXERCISE

02:59:32.194 --> 02:59:34.463
POWER AND CONTROL OVER HIS MOST

02:59:34.530 --> 02:59:37.967
PRECIOUS RESOURCE HIS LIFE A

02:59:38.033 --> 02:59:40.603
LIFE HE LEFT. HE TOLD US THAT

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:42.171
THE TRAIN WHAT'S COMING DOWN

02:59:42.238 --> 02:59:45.040
THE TRACKS. WE COULD ALL SEE IT

02:59:45.107 --> 02:59:47.376
WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. THE

02:59:47.443 --> 02:59:49.745
MEDICATION GAVE HIM THE POWER

02:59:49.812 --> 02:59:51.580
TO REMOVE HIMSELF FROM THE

02:59:51.647 --> 02:59:53.516
TRACKS IN HIS OWN TIME AND ON

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:56.886
HIS OWN TERMS. ULTIMATELY MY

02:59:56.952 --> 02:59:58.254
DAD DIDN'T INGEST THE

02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.156
MEDICATION AS IT'S CANCER

03:00:00.222 --> 03:00:02.057

THE HEADACHES AND SEIZURES

03:00:04.226 --> 03:00:06.061
NOTCH- PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH

03:00:06.128 --> 03:00:08.364
BRAIN CANCER. HE JUST BEGAN TO

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:10.533
SLEEP MORE AND MORE HE SLIPPED

03:00:10.599 --> 03:00:12.668
INTO A COMA FOR LESS THAN THE

03:00:12.735 --> 03:00:15.171
DAY AND DIED ON AUGUST NINTH

03:00:15.237 --> 03:00:17.306
JUST TEN WEEKS AFTER HIS

03:00:17.373 --> 03:00:19.808
DIAGNOSIS. EVEN THOUGH HE

03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.844
DIDN'T TAKE THE MEDICATION I

03:00:21.911 --> 03:00:23.846
REALIZE NOW THAT IT STARTED

03:00:23.913 --> 03:00:25.447
WORKING THE MINUTE AND ENTERED

03:00:25.514 --> 03:00:28.484
HIS HELP. IT HAD THE DESIRED

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:31.487
EFFECT AT THE MOST AGONIZING

03:00:31.554 --> 03:00:34.356
TIME AND ALL OF OUR LIVES. THE

03:00:34.423 --> 03:00:37.026
MEDICATION BROUGHT US COMFORT.

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.594
FOR A LECTURE REFLECTING ON HIS

03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:40.429
LIFELONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:42.231

DAD ONCE WROTE I FEEL AMONG THE

03:00:46.869 --> 03:00:48.103
MOST FORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE

03:00:48.170 --> 03:00:51.540
WORLD'S. HE WAS FORTUNATE EVEN

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:54.176
AND HOW HE DIED. HE DESCRIBED

03:00:54.243 --> 03:00:56.178
THE FINAL MONTHS OF HIS LIFE AS

03:00:56.245 --> 03:00:58.147
A WONDERFUL TIME DESPITE THE

03:00:58.214 --> 03:01:00.549
DISMAL CIRCUMSTANCES HE ENJOYED

03:01:00.616 --> 03:01:02.384
FOOD WINE AND CONVERSATION

03:01:02.451 --> 03:01:04.019
UNTIL THE FINAL WEEK OF HIS

03:01:04.086 --> 03:01:06.689
LIFE. HE WAS ABLE TO REFLECT ON

03:01:06.755 --> 03:01:08.657
HIS LIFE AND RECEIVE ALL BUT

03:01:08.724 --> 03:01:10.426
LOVE AND A LIVING MEMORIAL THAT

03:04:22.418 --> 03:04:24.019
ACCESSING THIS COMPASSIONATE

03:04:24.086 --> 03:04:27.556
LAW WAS NOT EASY. THERE WERE

03:04:27.623 --> 03:04:28.157
HURDLES NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO

03:04:28.223 --> 03:04:31.026
GO THROUGH. THE PROCESS OF

03:04:31.093 --> 03:04:33.996
ACCESSING LAW ADDED ANXIETY AND

03:04:34.062 --> 03:04:36.031
DISTRESS FROM MY MOTHER DURING

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:38.333

BEFORE HIS DEATH FROM AN

03:04:50.379 --> 03:04:52.781
AGGRESSIVE FORM OF SKIN CANCER

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:55.083

A HOSPICE CARE GIVER. SHE KNEW

03:04:59.988 --> 03:05:02.458
WHAT HER FUTURE WITH TERMINAL

03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:05.160
BREAST CANCER LOOKS LIKE. WHEN

03:05:05.227 --> 03:05:06.628
THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR GAVE

03:05:06.695 --> 03:05:08.363
FOR THE NEWS MY MOTHER TOLD MY

03:05:08.430 --> 03:05:10.966
FATHER IN ME AND I REMEMBER

03:05:11.033 --> 03:05:11.567
SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM ON

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:15.437
HER COUCH. IF I WASN'T CHICKEN

03:05:15.504 --> 03:05:16.905

03:05:19.908 --> 03:05:22.644
YOU WON'T LET ME SUFFER. MY DAD

PROMISED BUT THERE WAS NO E. L.

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:26.849
O. A AT THE TIME SO WE

03:05:26.915 --> 03:05:28.450
REASSURED HER HOSPICE WOULD

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:30.652
PROVIDE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:33.622
WHEN THE TIME CAME. FOR FOUR

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:34.890
AND A HALF YEARS MY MOTHER

03:05:34.957 --> 03:05:36.425

DRUGS AND CHEMOTHERAPY AND

03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:42.030
AROUND OF RADIATION. BUT THE

03:05:42.097 --> 03:05:43.465
CANCER CONTINUE TO SPREAD TO

03:05:43.532 --> 03:05:45.634
HER BONES INTO HER LUNGS AND

03:05:45.701 --> 03:05:48.470
LIVER. MY MOTHER'S PAIN WAS

03:05:48.537 --> 03:05:50.172
NEVER MANAGED WELL BUT SHE KEPT

03:05:50.239 --> 03:05:54.042
FIGHTING. BECAUSE OF PAIN IN

03:05:54.109 --> 03:05:56.078
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

03:05:56.144 --> 03:05:57.513
MY MOM COULD NOT LAY ON THE

03:05:57.579 --> 03:05:59.815
TABLE FOR THE CT SCAN THAT

03:05:59.882 --> 03:06:01.517
WOULD HAVE CONFIRMED IF THE

03:06:01.583 --> 03:06:03.452
CANCER HAD SPREAD TO HER BRAIN.

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:05.454
NEVER THE LESS IT WAS OBVIOUS

03:06:05.521 --> 03:06:07.289
TREATMENT WAS NOT WORKING. SHE

03:06:07.356 --> 03:06:09.391
WAS IN CONSTANT PAIN LOSING

03:06:09.458 --> 03:06:12.027
WEIGHT INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS AND

03:06:12.094 --> 03:06:16.431
AGITATED. BATTLING BAO ISSUES

03:06:16.498 --> 03:06:18.901
AND SHE WAS SPENDING HER DAYS

03:06:18.967 --> 03:06:20.369
LYING ON THE COUCH OR IN BED.

03:06:20.435 --> 03:06:21.570
SHE COULD NO LONGER PUT ON HER

03:06:21.637 --> 03:06:25.674
HEARINGS. SHE WAS DONE FIGHTING.

03:06:25.741 --> 03:06:27.442
MY MOM WENT TO HER ONCOLOGIST

03:06:27.509 --> 03:06:29.878
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND TOLD HIM

03:06:29.945 --> 03:06:31.980
SHE WAS READY FOR HOSPICE AND

03:06:32.047 --> 03:06:32.781
SHE ASKED FOR THE MEDICAL AID

03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:34.449

03:06:42.224 --> 03:06:44.092
WHEN THE LAW WAS FIRST PASSED.

03:06:44.159 --> 03:06:46.528
IN THE A YEAR LATER BY GIVING

03:06:46.595 --> 03:06:48.030

THIS IS HERE SHE PUT IT AWAY

03:06:50.699 --> 03:06:51.133
EACH TIME AND WE DID NOT

03:06:51.199 --> 03:06:53.936
DISCUSS IT. SADLY HER

03:06:54.002 --> 03:06:56.271
ONCOLOGIST DECLINE TO WRITE THE

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:58.740
PRESCRIPTION. HE DID THANKFULLY

03:06:58.807 --> 03:07:00.442
REFER HER TO A PRIMARY CARE

BUT NOT TURN HER OWN DOCTOR

03:07:06.081 --> 03:07:08.517
BECAUSE THEIR OWN CENTER PCP HE

03:07:08.584 --> 03:07:10.686

03:07:10.752 --> 03:07:12.421
IT ALSO DECLINED TO WRITE THE

03:07:12.487 --> 03:07:13.989

IN THE SAME MEDICAL SYSTEM AS

03:09:20.582 --> 03:09:22.851
HER ONCOLOGIST HE HAD ACCESS TO

03:09:22.918 --> 03:09:25.287
HER RECORDS. HER UNCLE JUST

03:09:25.353 --> 03:09:26.822
NEVER EXPRESSED ANY CONCERN

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:28.857
ABOUT HER CAPACITY HE KNEW THAT

03:09:28.924 --> 03:09:32.294
SHE- KNEW WHAT SHE WAS ASKING

03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:33.562
FOR AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO

03:09:33.628 --> 03:09:34.896
DIE WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND

03:09:34.963 --> 03:09:38.266
LIKELY MUCH- MY MOTHER SPENT

03:09:38.333 --> 03:09:40.068
TWO MORE LONG WEEKS LIVING WITH

03:09:40.135 --> 03:09:41.336
THE FEAR THAT SHE WOULD OSE

03:09:41.403 --> 03:09:42.270
THE MENTAL CAPACITY AND

03:09:42.337 --> 03:09:44.406
PHYSICAL ABILITY NECESSARY TO

03:09:44.473 --> 03:09:46.174
ACCESS THE LAW. IT SHOULD STILL

03:09:46.241 --> 03:09:48.376
BE SUFFERING. SHE WAS SO

03:09:48.443 --> 03:09:49.945
WORRIED ABOUT THE SECOND CAR

03:09:50.011 --> 03:09:51.980
RIDE. THAT SHE HAD A SPECIAL

03:09:52.047 --> 03:09:53.615
MEETING WITH A HOSPICE NURSE TO

03:09:53.682 --> 03:09:55.217
MAKE A PLAN FOR HANDLING HER

03:09:55.283 --> 03:09:58.120
PAIN AND ANXIETY. MY MOTHER WAS

03:09:58.186 --> 03:10:00.589
A COURAGEOUS WARRIOR WHO DEALT

03:10:00.655 --> 03:10:01.156

03:10:01.223 --> 03:10:04.693
GRACE. SHE WAS NO CHICKEN SHE

03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:06.394
SUFFERED FOR YEARS WILL

03:10:06.461 --> 03:10:08.230
FIGHTING FOR MORE TIME WITH US

03:10:08.296 --> 03:10:09.798
AT THAT SECOND APPOINTMENT I

03:10:09.865 --> 03:10:11.566
WATCH TRULY ON THE BED SHE

03:10:11.633 --> 03:10:14.336
COULD ONLY LAY DOWN. SHE DID

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:15.604
NOT HAVE THE ENERGY TO SET UP

03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:19.307
IN THE CHAIR. SHE LAID CLOSE

03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:22.043
YOUR EYES AND BREEZE. I WATCHED

03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:23.779
HER BREATHING AND I WONDERED

03:10:23.845 --> 03:10:25.914
SHE GONNA DIE RIGHT HERE IN

03:10:25.981 --> 03:10:27.983
THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE NOT AT

03:10:28.049 --> 03:10:29.151
HOME WHERE SHE SHOULD BE

03:10:29.217 --> 03:10:32.220
BECAUSE OF THIS FIFTY IS.

03:10:32.287 --> 03:10:34.623
ACTUALLY BEEN THIRTY BY THEN

03:10:34.689 --> 03:10:39.995
THIRTY TWO FOR MORE. THE DAY

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:42.097
AFTER THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

03:10:42.164 --> 03:10:43.064

03:10:44.399 --> 03:10:46.468
SACRAMENTO IT WAS ANOTHER

03:10:46.535 --> 03:10:48.470
HOUR'S DRIVE FOR ME AT THE

03:10:48.537 --> 03:10:49.805
CLOSEST COMPOUNDING PHARMACY

03:10:49.871 --> 03:10:53.175
THE DOCTOR KNEW OF ACCESS TO

03:10:53.241 --> 03:10:54.276
THE CONTACTING CAMPAIGNING

03:10:54.342 --> 03:10:56.044

ANOTHER ISSUE HAVEN'T HEARD

03:10:57.078 --> 03:10:58.647
TODAY BUT I THINK THERE'S

03:10:58.713 --> 03:11:00.448
SOMETHING TO THAT YEAH. THE

03:11:00.515 --> 03:11:03.185
LOCAL COMPOUNDING PHARMACY HAD

03:11:03.251 --> 03:11:04.452
JUST GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN

03:11:04.519 --> 03:11:06.454
GRASS VALLEY SO WE CAN USE THE

03:11:06.521 --> 03:11:12.460

03:11:16.464 --> 03:11:18.200
SHE LOST HER BATTLE. UNDERWAY

03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:20.802
FROM THE BED TO THE BATHROOM IN

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:25.140
HER ROOM. MY FATHER WAS A

03:11:25.207 --> 03:11:26.775
PRIMARY CARE GIVER AND I LIVE

03:11:26.842 --> 03:11:30.378
NEXT DOOR. THIS WAS THE

03:11:30.445 --> 03:11:32.948
INDIGNITY. THAT SHE DID NOT

03:11:33.014 --> 03:11:36.852
WANT TO LIVE WITH. ON SUNDAY

03:11:36.918 --> 03:11:39.187
SHE WOKE UP WITH A HEADACHE.

03:11:39.254 --> 03:11:42.090
AND SHE SAID OKAY I'M READY.

03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:44.192
BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE HAD

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:44.726
ONE BITE OF KRAFT MAC AND

03:11:44.793 --> 03:11:48.864

ABSORPTION THOUGH THE

03:11:54.669 --> 03:11:55.103
MEDICATION THAT SHE WAS

03:11:55.170 --> 03:11:57.672
PRESCRIBED WAS ENOUGH TO

03:11:57.739 --> 03:11:59.541
BASICALLY PUT DOWN AN ELEPHANT

03:11:59.608 --> 03:12:01.643
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE

03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:03.278
THE SHE FOLLOWS THE RULES. WE

03:12:03.345 --> 03:12:06.481

03:24:10.838 --> 03:24:12.239
FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S

03:24:12.306 --> 03:24:14.075
NOT THE WAY THAT WORKS.

03:24:14.141 --> 03:24:15.142
BRITNEY'S GOAL JUST LIKE THE

03:24:15.209 --> 03:24:16.410
HUNDREDS OF TERMINALLY ILL

03:24:16.477 --> 03:24:17.812
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE APPROACHED

03:24:17.878 --> 03:24:20.014
ME OVER THE YEARS. IS TO LIVE

03:24:20.081 --> 03:24:22.583
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO A

03:24:22.650 --> 03:24:23.884
TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUAL

03:24:23.951 --> 03:24:26.020
DOESN'T NEED FIFTEEN DAYS TO

03:24:26.087 --> 03:24:27.888
PROCESS THE REALITY. OF HOW

03:24:27.955 --> 03:24:29.023
THEIR DISEASE WILL AND THEIR

03:24:29.090 --> 03:24:32.560
LIFE. THE FAMILY MIGHT. SO ALL

03:24:32.627 --> 03:24:34.395
PUT THAT IN THERE THE FAMILY OF

03:24:34.462 --> 03:24:36.030
COURSE THEY THEY WANT THIRTY

03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:37.465
DAYS IF THEY COULD GET A THEY

03:24:37.531 --> 03:24:38.499
WANT THIRTY YEARS WITH THEIR

03:24:38.566 --> 03:24:40.334
LOVED ONE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:42.370
THE FIFTEEN DAYS IS TALKING

03:24:42.436 --> 03:24:45.006
ABOUT THIS WAITING PERIOD THE

03:24:45.072 --> 03:24:48.876
PATIENTS. EVERY PATIENT I'VE

03:24:48.943 --> 03:24:50.511
MET THEIR NAVIGATING WITH THIS

03:24:50.578 --> 03:24:52.313
WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN AND SO

03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:54.081
THE FIFTEEN DAY PERIOD IS

03:24:54.148 --> 03:24:56.717
RATHER OWNERS- AND ONLY BECAUSE

03:24:56.784 --> 03:24:58.185
CENTER MONNING HEAD HAD BROUGHT

03:24:58.252 --> 03:25:00.521
IT UP I JUST WANTED TO- ANSWER

03:25:00.588 --> 03:25:02.556
A QUESTION REGARDING THE VA-

03:25:02.623 --> 03:25:04.492
AND THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE

03:25:04.558 --> 03:25:06.327
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WAS A KID

03:25:06.394 --> 03:25:07.461
THAT I'VE KNOWN SINCE WERE FIVE

03:25:07.528 --> 03:25:08.996
YEARS OLD. HIS NAME IS JOHN

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:15.536
BISSINGER. HE WAS IN THE ARMY.

03:25:15.603 --> 03:25:17.405
AND HE WAS RECEIVING HIS CARE

03:25:17.471 --> 03:25:20.908
THROUGH THE VA. LIVE IN

03:25:20.975 --> 03:25:22.877
CALIFORNIA DOWN SAN DIEGO AND

03:25:22.943 --> 03:25:25.146
WHEN HE BROUGHT UP THE TOPIC OF

03:25:25.212 --> 03:25:26.947
MEDICAL AID IN DYING LIKELY

03:25:27.014 --> 03:25:31.152
BECAUSE HE HAD A VERY GOOD.

03:25:31.218 --> 03:25:33.120
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PHYSICIAN

03:25:33.187 --> 03:25:34.588
HE WAS TERMINALLY ILL WOULD

03:25:34.655 --> 03:25:35.856
QUALIFY FOR THIS YET A CHRONIC

03:25:35.923 --> 03:25:37.925
DISEASE THAT SPANNED NEARLY TWO

03:25:37.992 --> 03:25:40.361
DECADES- HIS PHYSICIAN SAID

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:41.729
THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THAT

03:25:41.796 --> 03:25:44.699
CONVERSATION JUST THAT ONE TIME.

03:25:44.765 --> 03:25:47.101
BUT BEYOND THAT IF YOUNG WAS TO

03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:49.370
BRING IT UP AGAIN- YOUNG TOLD

03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:51.939
ME THAT WHAT HIS OF PHYSICIAN

03:25:52.006 --> 03:25:54.208
SAID IS THAT THE PROTOCOL FOR

03:25:54.275 --> 03:25:56.243
THE VA IS THAT HE WOULD THEN

03:25:56.310 --> 03:25:58.679
HAVE TO PUT HIM IN A- A

03:25:58.746 --> 03:26:00.414
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION. BECAUSE

03:26:00.481 --> 03:26:01.749
HE'S ESSENTIALLY GOING AGAINST

03:26:01.816 --> 03:26:03.751
THE POLICY SO IT'S JUST AN

03:26:03.818 --> 03:26:04.952
EXAMPLE OF WHERE POLICY AND

03:26:05.019 --> 03:26:07.354
PROCESS OF THE VA IN THIS CASE

03:26:07.421 --> 03:26:08.122
IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF

03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:10.024
PATIENT CARE- AND THAT'S

03:26:10.091 --> 03:26:11.959
SOMETHING THAT WHEN I'VE BEEN

03:26:12.026 --> 03:26:12.993
IN DC WORKING ON AND I KNOW

03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:13.894
THAT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE IT'S

03:26:13.961 --> 03:26:15.196
NOTHING THAT WE CAN CONTROL

03:26:15.262 --> 03:26:17.098
HERE IN THE STATE BUT- IT IS

03:26:17.164 --> 03:26:18.933
JUST A MATTER OF TRAINING FOR-

03:26:18.999 --> 03:26:21.035
THE MEN AND WOMEN IN. UNIFORM

03:26:21.102 --> 03:26:23.137
THAT RECEIVE THEIR CARE- FROM

03:26:23.204 --> 03:26:26.173
THE VA- THAT IT IS HANDLED IN

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:33.614
A- IN A WAY THAT. DOESN'T YEAH.

03:26:33.681 --> 03:26:35.082
CAST THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE

03:26:35.149 --> 03:26:36.684
ASKING FOR A RIGHT THAT IS

03:26:36.751 --> 03:26:39.987
LEGAL IN THE STATE AND A SENSE

03:26:40.054 --> 03:26:41.355
OF SHAME THEM JUST FOR ASKING

03:26:41.422 --> 03:26:44.692
SO. THANKS I JUST WANTED SURE

03:26:44.759 --> 03:26:46.260
THOSE TWO ITEMS BECAUSE THERE

03:26:46.327 --> 03:26:47.561
WERE PERTINENT TO THE ONES WHO

03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:49.096
WERE BROUGHT UP AND I'LL BE

03:26:49.163 --> 03:26:51.065
QUICK ON MY PREPARED REMARKS-

03:26:51.132 --> 03:26:53.000
SO YES BRITNEY BRITNEY IS CASE

03:26:53.067 --> 03:26:55.503
RECEIVED. A LOT OF ATTENTION-

03:26:55.569 --> 03:26:57.671
SHE DIED FIVE YEARS AGO-

03:26:57.738 --> 03:26:58.873
BECAUSE WE HAD TO LEAVE OUR

03:26:58.939 --> 03:27:00.441
HOME HERE IN CALIFORNIA DRIVE

03:27:00.508 --> 03:27:02.343
TO OREGON. SO SHE WOULD HAVE

03:27:02.409 --> 03:27:04.411
THE OPTION OF THIS OF A GENTLE

03:27:04.478 --> 03:27:07.047
DYING PROCESS. SHE WAS ALSO

03:27:07.114 --> 03:27:08.716
ONLY TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD. THE

03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:10.017
REASON BERNIE SPOKE UP WAS

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:11.552
BECAUSE SHE WAS FIGHTING FOR

03:27:11.619 --> 03:27:12.686
TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:14.889
MAY NOT HAVE A VOICE. SHE SPOKE

03:27:14.955 --> 03:27:16.657
UP SO THAT NO ONE ELSE IN

03:27:16.724 --> 03:27:18.325
CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY BUT IN

03:27:18.392 --> 03:27:20.094
ANY STATE. WHATEVER HAVE TO

03:27:20.161 --> 03:27:22.863
LEAVE THEIR HOME AFTER BEING

03:27:22.930 --> 03:27:23.430
TOLD YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS TO

03:27:23.497 --> 03:27:25.366
LIVE. REGARDING THAT EXPERIENCE

03:27:25.432 --> 03:27:26.600
USER BRITNEY'S WORDS SHE WOULD

03:27:26.667 --> 03:27:28.936
SAY. HAVING TO LEAVE OUR HOME

03:27:29.003 --> 03:27:29.436
THIS IS SUCH A HUGE AND

03:27:29.503 --> 03:27:31.772
JUSTICE. AND A MONUMENTAL WASTE

03:27:31.839 --> 03:27:34.875
OF TIME. IT WAS TIME OF COURSE

03:27:34.942 --> 03:27:38.078
THAT BRITNEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE

03:27:38.145 --> 03:27:41.048
TO SPARE. BUT NOW WITH GREAT

03:27:41.115 --> 03:27:42.550
PRIDE IN THE IMPACT THAT HER

03:27:42.616 --> 03:27:45.553
STORY HAS MADE- MY TESTIMONY

03:27:45.619 --> 03:27:47.454
TODAY OR WHAT I'M SHARING IT

03:27:47.521 --> 03:27:49.824
MIRRORS OF THE TESTIMONY THAT I

03:27:49.890 --> 03:27:51.559
PROVIDED AT THE LAST SELECT

03:27:51.625 --> 03:27:53.194
COMMITTEE COMMITTEE HEARING.

03:27:53.260 --> 03:27:53.861
BUT NOW THOSE WORDS ARE

03:27:53.928 --> 03:27:55.229
AMPLIFIED BECAUSE TWO MORE

03:27:55.296 --> 03:27:57.731
YEARS OF PASSED. I CONTINUE TO

03:27:57.798 --> 03:27:58.899
HAVE COUNTLESS TERMINALLY ILL

03:27:58.966 --> 03:28:00.434
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILY

03:28:00.501 --> 03:28:02.903
MEMBERS SHARE WITH ME. HOW

03:28:02.970 --> 03:28:04.138
GRATEFUL THEY ARE TO HAVE THIS

03:28:04.205 --> 03:28:06.307
OPTION IN CALIFORNIA.

03:28:06.373 --> 03:28:07.441
ADDITIONALLY WHAT THEY SHARE IS

03:28:07.508 --> 03:28:08.809
THAT THEY WISH THE PROCESS

03:28:08.876 --> 03:28:10.311
WOULD RUN SMOOTHER WE FOR SOME

03:28:10.377 --> 03:28:12.046
CASES OF WORD HAS GONE WELL

03:28:12.112 --> 03:28:14.248
KAISER NOR CAL SEEMS TO DO A

03:28:14.315 --> 03:28:15.416
REALLY GOOD JOB AND OTHER

03:28:15.482 --> 03:28:16.917
INSTITUTIONS WHERE IT'S NOT.

03:28:16.984 --> 03:28:18.485
THEY WISH OUR NEIGHBORING OR

03:28:18.552 --> 03:28:19.320
THEIR LOCAL MEDICAL

03:28:19.386 --> 03:28:21.188
INSTITUTIONS WOULD MAKE THIS

03:28:21.255 --> 03:28:22.857
OPTION AVAILABLE TO THEIR

03:28:22.923 --> 03:28:24.925
PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ALIKE.

03:28:24.992 --> 03:28:26.360
AND THAT THE CHURCH AND OTHER

03:28:26.427 --> 03:28:28.062
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS WOULD

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.864
STOP TRYING TO IMPOSE THEIR

03:28:29.930 --> 03:28:31.031
NARROW BELIEF SYSTEM ON TO THE

03:28:31.098 --> 03:28:32.967
REST OF SOCIETY. SPECIFICALLY

03:28:33.033 --> 03:28:34.435
THAT REGULARLY SHOULD THE NEED

03:28:34.501 --> 03:28:35.536
TO SHORTEN THE FIFTEEN DAY

03:28:35.603 --> 03:28:37.605
WAITING PERIOD SHORTENED DOWN

03:28:37.671 --> 03:28:38.572
TO SOMETHING MAYBE LESS THAN

03:28:38.639 --> 03:28:41.075
FIVE DAYS. IN THEIR WISDOM

03:28:41.141 --> 03:28:42.910
THESE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS

03:28:42.977 --> 03:28:45.246
HAVE ACCURATELY DECIPHERED. BUT

03:28:45.312 --> 03:28:46.547
THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD

03:28:46.614 --> 03:28:48.148
IS VERY LIKELY A POLITICAL

03:28:48.215 --> 03:28:50.184
COMPROMISE OF SORTS. INSTEAD OF

03:28:50.251 --> 03:28:51.218
ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS

03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:53.654
THE PATIENT. THEY REITERATE THE

03:28:53.721 --> 03:28:55.356
SENSE OF SALAS AND RELIEF A TWO

03:28:55.422 --> 03:28:56.724
BY SIMPLY HAVING QUALIFY FOR

03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:59.326

STATING THEIR HOPE THAT THEY'LL

03:29:03.197 --> 03:29:04.365
NEVER NEED TO UTILIZE THE

03:29:04.431 --> 03:29:06.934
MEDICATION. THEY'RE GLAD TO SEE

03:29:07.001 --> 03:29:08.435
THE CULTURAL CHANGES WHICH ARE

03:29:08.502 --> 03:29:10.504
SLOWLY TAKING PLACE THE SIMPLE

03:29:10.571 --> 03:29:12.806
RECOGNITION OF OUR COLLECTIVE

03:29:12.873 --> 03:29:14.074
HUMANITY AND MORTALITY. THE

03:29:14.141 --> 03:29:15.643
SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT LIFE

03:29:15.709 --> 03:29:17.444
ALL LIFE EVENTUALLY COMES TO AN

03:29:17.511 --> 03:29:22.716
END AND THAT ENDINGS MATTER.

03:29:22.783 --> 03:29:24.485
LISTENING LISTEN TO THE

03:29:24.551 --> 03:29:28.088
