HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN ORDER SO THEY WILL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AND THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TITLE CHILDHOOD LEAD LEVELS MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL HAVE NOT RECEIVED REQUIRE TESTING FOR LEAD POISONING. THANK SIMPLY MEMORY FOR. THIS AUDIT OF THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND ALLOWING ME TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THAT REQUEST. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW EXPOSURE TO LEAD NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS. AND CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX OR ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO LEAD POISONING AND ITS HARMFUL EFFECTS. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT I SIGNED ON TO THIS I REQUEST IS BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN LIVING IN OUR STATE. ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIESDESERVE TO HAVE ADEQUATE LEAD LEVEL TESTING TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT EXPOSED TO LESS HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS. AS THE AUDIT REPORT POINTS OUT THE STATE REQUIRES TESTING. REQUIRES TESTING. CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE GREATEST RISK OF LEAD POISONING INCLUDING THOSE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE OUR OTHER PROGRAMS FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN. URBAN OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE RULES IN PREVENTING DETECTING AND RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS OF LEAD POISONING DH CS OVERSEAS A PROVISIONS OF LEAD TEST TO CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL AND CD PH OVERSEAS A STATEWIDE LET PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTS THAT BOTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE FAILED TO FULLY MEET THEIR RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION ONE TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE NOW WE'RE NOT TESTED AT ALL AND ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN MISSED ONE OF THE TWO TESTS THEY SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. SO ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE CHILDREN WERE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE AL A RECEIVING ALL THE RECOMMENDED LEAD TESTS. FURTHER THE OTTER FOUND THAT MANY CHILDREN WHO DO NOT RECEIVE ALL THE TESTS WERE FROM AREAS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. THE US AVERAGE LEAD TESTING RATE OF CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO. YEARS IN MEDIC MEDICAID IS ALMOST 45% CALIFORNIA'S RATE IS APPROX 36% THE CONCERN THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR LEAD TESTING RATES FOR CHILDREN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WE SHOULD BE TESTING AT THE RATE OF 80% LIKE OTHER STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA. TODAY WE WILL DISCUSS THE ADDITIONAL FIND IS IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AND THE RULES. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT'S PLANS FOR CHANGES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. TO HELP INSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE. CHILDREN ARE TESTED. AREAS AT HIGH RISK FOR LEAD POISONING ARE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVERSEAS. MANAGED CARE PLANS A PROVIDE LEAD TEST AND ADOPT A PERFORMANCE STANDARD FOR LEAD TEST DESIGNED TO MONITOR. SUCCESS LED TESTING THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THEIR PROGRAM- THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND OVERSEEING THE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND THAT THE DEPARTMENTS MEET ALL LEADS TO MATT. ADDITIONALLY WE WILL HEAR PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE REPORT FROM LOCAL AGENCIES. INVOLVED WITH THE LEAD POISONING PREVENTION. MY GOAL FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IS TO SHED LIGHT ON BEST PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPROVE OUR TESTING RATES ROUTE CALIFORNIAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE-SAFE- WITH THAT I DO I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR COMMITTEE CHAIRS- FROM THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND I INVITE THEM TO GIVE AN OPENING STATEMENT AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WHO CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE SENATOR ALLEN WHOSE CHAIR OF THIS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE- SENATOR PAN WHO'S THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF ANY OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT AT THIS TIME. PLEASE DOCTOR WOULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'M JUST ANXIOUSLY LOOKING FORWARD TO- HOW THIS MIGHT BE ADDRESSED IN THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OUR ARE. AUDIT IS BEING CRITICAL. OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES- MY CONCERN LAST YEAR OVER- PREVENTIVE SERVICES THE CHILDREN NOT GETTING- PRETTY SHOCKING- THE HAVE THE PERCENTAGE IS THERE. THIS ONE IN MY OWN DISTRICT AS THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME. OF ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CHILDREN- BETWEEN ONE AND TWO HAVE WE'RE WE'RE DID RECEIVE HER BLOOD TESTING THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE I BELIEVE. WHICH IS PRETTY SHOCKING- AS WELL SO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS IS GOING FORWARD AND THEN FROM WE HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO. TWO OF THE CHILDREN WE HAVE ON MEDI CAL AND WE'RE- NOT MEETING THAT MANDATE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE. THE DOCTOR WOULD. PLEASE THANK YOU SO MUCH OF CHAIR SALAS AND I ALSO APPRECIATE TO OUR COMMITTEES COMING TOGETHER TO DRESS REPORT I THINK IS CHIU WOULD MENTION WE WERE ACTUALLY CHIU WHAT I WOULD. TO HE'S RIGHT WORD WELL WE YEAH WE WOULD CARE TO JOINT. THIS AND- SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARING AT THE DATE IS THAT AS CHAIR WOULD BE THE LOOK AT OUR TO LOOKED AT HOW SUPERVISION PREVENTED A VISITS I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE CAL WHO GOT TO PREVENT VISITS JUST THE VISIT WHICH TO REMOTE ALSO WOULD BE THE- WHICH WE- TALK. ABOUT AND THEN PERFORMING THE WILL THE LED TO AS WELL WE'RE BELOW THAT WE SAW OTHER STATES ACTUALLY THE AVERAGE LOW HALF BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL. EVEN AT A VERY YOUNG AGE THE WERE YOU WOULD VERY LOW EVEN LOWERED THAT SO AND FORTUNE ME NICE BE SURPRISE TO ME THAT ARE LET'S. RATES ARE SO LOW BECAUSE OUR WELL CHILD VISIT RAY ARE SO LOW AS A PDF. SO VERY. OF THE DANGER OF LAW AND IT'S TALK EFFECT OF TO TICKLE OF THE BRAIN. AND THE NERVES SYSTEM AND DOES SO I WOULD MAKE THAT. THAT AND CAL. WELL WE HAVE THE LOW A OF. HOUSING POTENTIAL LEAD PAINT LET PRODUCTS IN THEIR AS AN THAT'S A STATE. THAT ARE UP IN THE NO. OR OTHER PLACES WITH OLDER WE SAW DO. A HOUSING HERE TO THAT THE HAVE LET. AND I'D AND THE REASON I MENTIONED IS THA EVEN AS WE'RE TALKING A- THIS AUDIT. WE ALSO TO THINK WHAT THE FOLLOWS IS FOR. WE HAVE A HOUSE CRISIS WE HAVE HE CAN'T. HOW AND SO WE DO WE DO WITH THE- WHEN THEY HAVE POSITIVE LED. AND ENTER. AND DO THEY DO WE HAVE TO FIND THEM HOUSING BECAUSE THAT'S MOST LIKELY SOURCE I MEAN STILL TO DO INVESTIGATE. THAT'S A SO OF THE LEAD. AND WHERE DO THEY GO. AND WHAT KIND OF HOUSING TO HAVE THE- SO THE FAMILY CAN TAKE THEIR TO. OUT THAT POTENTIALLY TALK ENVIRONMENT. AND SO CERTAINLY HERE I KNOW WILL BE FOCUSING MORE ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS PARTICULAR ARTICLE WE ALSO NEED TO THINK THROUGH. WHAT AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING IT I ANY MEANS WELL WE SHOULD TELL. ON THE WHAT TO KNOW BUT THEN WE ARE. TO THAT WORK ON THE SOLUTIONS. TO HELP THE FOR AS AS OF COURSE. TRY TO IMPROVE OUR- SCREEN PROCESS IT'S BEEN A PROCESS THAT WE ALSO AND- TO NIGHT THE SCREEN IN FIND OUT OF. WE NEED TO HAVE THE REPORT TO ACT ON THOSE RISK. AND HELP THOSE FAMILY. FIGURE WE'RE GOING TO ANY GATES ARE. THE LEAD EXPOSURE IN THESE CHILDREN SO TO ME THIS IS A HERE THAT'S BE VERY AND- AS A FIRST BUT WE- HAVE. STEPS WE NEED TO THROUGH ON. TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. TO CLEAR YOUR MOST OFTEN. THANK CIRCUMSTANCES THANK THANK YOU DOCTOR SO ALAN PLEASE. WELL I WANT TO THINK THAT'S EMBRACE AND. AND OF COURSE OUR CHAIR OF JAIL FOR PROCEEDING WITH THIS CERTAINLY SO REALLY SHOCKED FINDINGS FROM MY- ARE READ OF THE DOCK AND I LOOK FOR TO THE- AND I HAVE A BABY BOY MYSELF AND ON CERTAIN THE- YOU KNOW. MISS PUT EVERYTHING INTO HOLD LAYER FIRST FROM WHICH KNOW THAT THERE IS A TERM OF POISONING AND LASSEN TO ADOPT THAT ADULTHOOD AND HAVE US SERIES OF HOW IMPACT THAT. THAT THE WE AND UP THAT THE BABCOCK BOTH IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND AN AND CALL FOR EVERY ELSE AND SO IT'S A ONE OF MANY IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GET REMEDY AND SO LOOKING FOR OUR DISCUSSIONS AND OF COURSE AS PANTS IT AND WE GO FROM HERE AND- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY- ARE THE PHONE. OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE TWO. I DON'T KNOW MY THE STAFF. YOU HAVE OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE COVERED IS OBVIOUSLY LESS AND SO. ON SCHOOL IN PORT DISCUSSION TODAY AND LOOK FOR TO WE LEARN. THANK CENTER WE ALSO WITH US ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK WHO'S THE CHAIR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COME. COMMITTEE WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY BUT I BELIEVE. ASSEMBLY WOMAN CRISTINA GARCIA WHO SITS ON THE COMMITTEE IS. PREPARED TO MAKE AN OPENING REMARK FOR THE CHAIRMAN I GUESS THINGS FOR THE CHAIR AND FOR. MYSELF TURN HER AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE SPACE FOR A NUMBER A YEARS NOW AND- WE HAVE SEEN HOW AGENCIES CONTINUE TO FAIL OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR- LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THOSE BILLS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY ON AND SO I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AUDIT THAT OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE REQUESTED. NOTCHES POINTING TO THE FACT THAT. WE'RE NOT. UP THAT WAY NOT. YOU TAKE THE IN OUR COMMUNITY BOAT REALLY AGENCIES ARE FOR US IN LET'S DIVIDE WE PASSED AND ARE PREPARED TO HEAR AND ABOUT HOW WE GET IT RIGHT AND HOW DO WE MOVE. BUT WE NEED COME IN FROM THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIRIN DOING WHAT WAS INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE KNOW FROM THE AUDIT WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S OFTEN TIMES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT WE SEE THESE CLUSTERS I AND DISUSS LET'S IS LOWER TO BABY. TALK THIS NOT JUST TESTING BUT TO ADDRESS UP ON IN A LOW TELL YOU THAT THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE HOMES HAVE LED AN THEM KNOW WHAT IT DO WITH THOSE WE DON'T MOVE THEM. SAN THOUSAND HOMES AND I CAN. AT BECAUSE OF SIDE AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD. TO DO MY SHOES BEFORE GO IN THE HOUSE WITHIN. NOT TO PLAY OUTSIDE. WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO THE SOFT AS PART ON AND- WITH TOLD TO BASICALLY LIVE WITH THE- ON SO WE ALREADY HAVE. THAT PUSH NOW I. THAT CAN. TO THE CASE OUT THERE. THERE A LETTER. WHETHER IT IS LIKE EXCITED ARE WE A LOT OF OTHER SOURCES IT'S EXPOSE TO SOME OF COUNTY OF WERE EATING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE COMING AND I THINK LIKE MINE THERE'S A LOT OF THEIR THINGS OUT THERE THAT ARE MAY A SAY AND EVERY IS. THAT THE AUDIT TOLD A LOT OF WHAT WE ALREADY HI IN YOU AND GAVE US SOME WORST FEARS THERE. SO LOOKING FOR. TO HEAR. HOW WE'RE GOING TO. MOVE FORWARD AND SO TO KEEP COMMUNITY HEALTHY AND MAKE SURE THAT I SHOW. ARE NOT BEING SIR. UP A LIFETIME OF FILM BECAUSE THE SIM. THEY WERE BORN IN A THERE THE NEW. UP ALONG THE WAY. I ANY CHILD AT SIX TO THIS IS A CHAT TO MANY. AT THE- CRIMINAL WHEN IT'S CHILDREN OF COLOR. HIS CONSTANT. IN RETALIATES AND COMMUNITY CENTER TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE OVER HER. I WOULD TO NOTES THERE IS ENOUGH OF BILLS LEDGE THAT PENDING REGARD TIS. FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS UP THE DIET WE HAVE SOME BILL TO TWO SEVEN SIX BY SOME MEMBER. AND NUMBER OF OTHER SIMPLY TWENTY SEVENTY SO BY MISS AND- SO I BUILT TWO SÝ EIGHT BY WOMEN QUIRK AND- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO. NINE BY THIS GARCIA AND OTHERS A PLEA WE WALL JOIN AUTHOR EACH OTHER'S LED. AND THEN WE HAVE ASSN BILL ONE. AND TO PLACE LEYVA SO THE IS PENDING LET. BRADY WANT TO AND AS WOMAN ELOISE RAY IS TO MAKE IT UP. REMARK AS REQUESTED THIS AUDIT LAST YEAR PLEASE MISTRESS. THANK YOU AND NUMBER. I TO FIRST THING THE JOINT PLEASE OF WATER COMING. AND THE AUDITOR. FOR THEIR APPROVAL AND PART ON STE. ON A REPORT. MORE ON THIS ISSUE A FEW YEARS NOW AND TO AND TIME AGAIN AT THE BY STATING. THAT THEY WERE IN FOR DOING THEIR JOBS. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID IN A HEARING AND BILL HEARING IN UP LETTERS. AND ON. IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT THESE AGE IN FACT ONE FAR THEIR FEDERAL STATE MANDATES. AND WE KNEW THE WERE RECEIVING THE APPROACH TEST AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THESE KIDS. LATER FOUND THAT WITH THESE KIDS UFFERED FROM THE BLOOD LEAD POISONING. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE DEPARTMENTS INTENDED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INACCURATE AND DARE I SAY FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR WORK OR LACK THERE OF. WITH CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION BEING POISONED WITH CALIPH. BY BY LAND IN THEIR WATER AND THEIR HOMES. I DO KNOW THAT AS OF NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONTINUED TO REPORT NUMBERS TO THE ASSEMBLY THAT WERE WILDLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDITOR. IT WAS JUST TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE AUDIT CAME OUT. T. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THEIR JOBS. JOB SWITCH WHEN DONE ACCURATELY COULD SAVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. I'M CONCERNED WITH A LACK OF ACCURACY AND TRUTH IN DISCUSSING THE STATUS OF THE WORK THEY WERE DOING. AND LASTLY I'M CONCERNED WITH THE LEVEL OF APATHY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ALLOWED THIS TO BE A CONSISTENT PROBLEM YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. DO THEY HAVE TO THE DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. I NEED YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION CRITICALLY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT COMPLETING THE STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES AS IT RELATES TO BLOOD LET TESTS AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES. THAT YOU ARE ACTIVELY PERPETUATING CYCLES OF POVERTY FOR POOR CALIFORNIANS. IT'S EMBARRASSING AND SHAMEFUL TO HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH S THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WELL WE HAVE CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE WERE BEING POISONED BECAUSE OF THE WATER THEIR DRINKING OF THE STATE IS NOT DOING ITS PART. TO SUPPORT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AT DIAGNOSING AND PREVENTING THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HOPE THAT WE CAN LEARN DIRECTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENTS. THE HOW AND WHY WE GOT HERE. BUT MAYBE EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S INTENT TO DO TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND WHEN BILL MAILED MAKE GOOD ON THESE PROMISES. I AM VERY GLAD TO BE WORKING ON A PACKAGE OF BILLS WITH SOME BRILLIANT PASSIONATE AND HARDWORKING COLLEAGUES. AND I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THIS AUDIT. WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP THIS MAY FINALLY BE THE YEAR WE CAN START TO PROTECTION CALIFORNIA'S KIDS FROM THIS PREVENT PREVENTABLE CRISIS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO SO. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS IN THE MEMBERS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WITH YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN- WITH THAT I KNOW THAT. LIKE A MOMENT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE- SENATOR- MY ELENA'S ON ALSO ALSO SUBMITTED A STATEMENT TO THE COMMITTEE WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS AS WELL SHE DID WANT ME TO JUST READ SOMETHING ON THE RECORD FOR HER- I WILL JUST PARAPHRASE IF ANYBODY WANTS THE- THE LETTER WERE BORN HAVE TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE. BUT CENTER DORADO INTERSTATE BUT SAID LEAD POISONING IS A HEALTH AND HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS CALIFORNIA WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY FOUR ALONE OUT OF MEDICAL MEDI CAL AND ROLLED OVER A JUST WANTED TO A TOTAL OF FIFTY THOUSAND TWO AND FIFTY. TWO OF THE ARE NOT GOOD FOR CLINICS. THESE RESULTS ARE ACCEPTABLE. AND NOT JUST FOR MY COMMUNITY BUT FOR SO MANY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA MORE FOR THIS IS ALSO THE REALITY THAT SO MANY CHILDREN I DO NOT GET TESTED WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD. COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS A PANEL. MISS LABOR FOR OUR COUNTY ALSO I ON THAT LEAVE ALSO IN THAT PANEL DR DAVID APOLLO RIVERS FRESNO CAN'T DOCTOR. THE LIVE YEAH. BECAUSE. A SERIES. I REPRESENTS COUNTY OR DEAL WITH THE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSES BEHALF OF THE COUNTIES THEY WILL ALL NOT BE IN A TEN TODAY WITH LET'S GO TO CALL UP OUR AUDITOR. MEMBERS THIS IS A CHEN ITEM TWO. AGENDA ITEM TWO OVERVIEW MODIFY WRECKED. WE HAVE STATE OUT OF LANE HOW WITH HER IS JOHN FROM WATER JOSH WILL HOP SENIOR OUTER BUT WATER WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OTHER TO CHAIRS OF OTHER COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME ELAINE HOW AND CALIFORNIA STATE AUTO WITH ME AS AS THE CHAIR INDICATED JOHN KLINE IS TO MY RIGHT HE WAS THE OUT OF PRINCIPLE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. JOSHUA HOOPER'S ON MY LEFT HE WAS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND THEY WILL BE STEPPING YOU THROUGH- THE MATERIALS THAT THE SERGEANT HANDED OUT NOW WE HAVE A VARIETY OF GRAPHICS- THAT WE INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT REPORT AND SOME ADDITIONAL GRAPHICS THAT WILL. ILLUSTRATE ISSUES THAT IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AND WILL ALSO T&lt;c.cyan&gt; TOO MANY OF&lt;/c&gt; THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE. I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE REPORT IN THREE VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL AND THEN HANDED OFF TO MISTER KLEIN SO HE CAN START STEPPING YOU THROUGH- THE DOCUMENT THAT THE SERGEANTS. AGAIN HANDED OUT. WE IDENTIFIED ISSUES IN THREE KEY AREAS- AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE FIRST FEW AREAS WERE RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TESTING ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL AS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR CHILDREN. AGES ONE AND TWO NEED TO BE TESTED AND THAT'S REQUIRED THAT THESE CHILDREN BE TESTED FOR LEAD. AGAIN AS PART OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND AS MISTER KLEIN WILL STEP YOU THROUGH SOME GRAPHICS AND MANY MANY CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT BEING TESTED. OVER THE NINE YEAR WINDOW THAT WE LOOK AT. ONE OF THE REASONS- WE IDENTIFIED THAT AS A PROBLEM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS NOT MAKING. THEY ARE MONITORING. CARE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PLANS THAT GET INFORMATION FROM THE PROVIDER. UNDERSTAND THEY KNEW TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROVIDERS ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING THESE TESTS AND REPORTING THAT INFORMATION UP TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES SO THE STATE HAS IDEA. STATE WHY HOME KIDS TO. AND THREE OF THOSE TESTS ARE THERE WAS. ISSUE WE I IN A FIVE. OF THE NEEDS THAT WOULD. WE IDENTIFIED IN THE RE BE ISSUED LAST YEAR AND MARK LOOKED AT AX TO CARE FOR TO. ACT TO PER SIR. ONE OF THE KEY. WE HAD IN THAT. WAS THE STAND THAT HEALTH SERVICE HAS FOR AGES THROUGH SIX SO THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT PROVIDERS AND MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE TO. ABIDE BY WE SAW THE HIGHEST UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN IN THOSE AGE GROUPS BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING MEASURED AGAINST A PARTICULAR STANDARD. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT THAT WE ISSUED JUST BACK IN JANUARY IS THERE IS NO UP SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE STANDARD FOR. TESTING FOR LEAD- MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO ARE GETTING TESTED AND IF THEY DON'T GET TESTED. THEY HAVE TO BE TESTED BY AGE SIX- SO WE WERE LOOKING TO SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAD A STAB TO PERFORM STAND THEY HAD NOT. THEY TO OUR CA. IS IT. ANOTHER YEAR BE THE X. COMPLETE THAT PARTICULAR. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH SERVICE. THE FINAL ISSUE WHEN IT THIS GROUPING IS RELATED TO OUT AND EDUCATION NOT JUST EDUCATING PROVIDERS ABOUT THE NEED TO PROVIDE THIS TESTER. MAKE SURE THAT THIS TEST IS GIVEN TO CHILDREN BUT EDUCATING FAMILIES ABOUT PREVENTIVE SERVICES FIRST OF ALL. BUT SO BILL A TO F. TILED IS TEST. BACK TO CATIA. STE OUR SERVICES THEY HAVE ACCESS THROUGH LOCAL PREVENTION PROGRAMS TO GET THE PROPER CARE THAT THAT CHILD NEEDS TO GET THAT LED. ELIMINATED FROM THEIR BODY ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THOSE THOSE SERVICES SO THEY WEREN'T AGAIN HEALTH CARE SERVICES NOT DOING ENOUGH TO INFORM FAMILIES MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE AWARE. OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO THAT'S IT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES ISSUES WHICH MISTER CLINAL STEP THROUGH IN A MOMENT. THE SECOND KEY AREAS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR IDENTIFYING RISK AREA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SOME ON THE DAY YES YOU HAVE SO GRAPHICS WE LOOK INTO YOUR SPECIFIC DISTRICT WE DID IF SHARES OF EACH OF THE COMMITTEE. TO OFFER. INTERACTIVE MAP OF CALIFORNIA ON OUR WEBSITE SO FOLKS COULD GO IN AND SEE OUR THEIR- CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING TESTED IN WET HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD IN MY COMMUNITY- ARE THEIR HOT SPOTS IN MY COMMUNITY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING IDENTIFYING RISK IN THE STATE. IDENTIFYING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT MAY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD OR HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAPPED BEEN TESTED AND- I'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT MEANS OTHER CHILDREN IN THAT REGION- ARE POTENTIALLY BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD POISONING AND THOSE. ARE NEED TO BE TESTED SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. SO PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO ASSIST IN ABATEMENT. MAKING SURE THAT. LEAD ABATEMENT IS OCCURRING IN THE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT IS THERE PRIMARILY JUST MONITORING ABATEMENT. FOR THOSE HOMES FOR WHICH CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TESTED AND ENDED UP WITH A POSITIVE RESULT SO NOT BEING MORE PROACTIVE WE WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE MORE PROACTIVE- WITH RESPECT TO IDENTIFYING RISK AREAS AND THEN DOING WHAT IT CAN WORKING WITH THE LOCALS. TO ABATE THOSE THOSE- AREAS THAT HAVE LED POISE. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IN THIS AREA AGAIN IS MORE ABOUT EDUCATION AND BEING PROACTIVE- AND CREATING ONLINE REGISTRIES ESSENTIALLY INFORMATION THAT SOME OTHER STATES PROVIDE ON THEIR WEBSITES. OF AREAS IN CALIFORNIA OR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CHILDREN TESTED WHERE THEY THEY WERE IDENTIFIED TO HAVE LEAD POISONING. AND THIS REALLY WOULD PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE REGIONS IN THE STATE. THE LAST AREA WAS REALLY LOOKING AT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THEY HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC A RESPONSIBLE FOR CRUDE COMPLETING A BIENNIAL REPORT A LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS AND THEN FINALLY DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD LAY OUT WHAT ARE THE RISK-FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE ASSESSED. IN A COMMUNITY I'M NOT JUST PERHAPS THE USE OF LEAD PAINT AND HOUSING BUT THERE ARE OTHER RISK FACTORS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN REGULATIONS AND WE WERE SEEING AND YOU'LL SEE IN A GRAPHIC. OTHER STATES HAVE A LOT MUCH BROADER LIST OF FACTORS THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AND PROVIDER SHOULD BE CONSIDERING WHEN THEY'RE ASSESSING THE RISK OF A CHILD BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD POISONING. THE LAST TWO AREAS RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH WORK. WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE MORE FOR CHANGES TO STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING WHAT LABS ACTUALLY REPORT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU'LL SEE WHEN MISTER HOOPER STEPS YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE GRAPHICS A LARGE NUMBER OF TESTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROCESS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THAT TASK TO A SPECIFIC MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IDEA CHILD- SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE FELT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I KNOW THAT SOME OF THIS IS BEING ADDRESSED IN IN LEGISLATION. AND THEN THE LAST YEAR WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS THEY ALLOCATE MONIES TO LOCAL- PROGRAMS. THESE LOCAL PREVENTION PROGRAMS BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THEIR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES AND THE FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITY TO GET WHERE A GRAPH. PACKET IT REALLY SHOWS.VERITY AND- THEY PROVIDE PLANS TO LOW LOW ENTITIES. OUT THERE USING INFORMATION THAT IS DATE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND SO THEY HAVE AN UP IN THAT. FORM REFLECT WHAT. IS BEING DONE OF FIGHTING FOR HIS FOR AS THE NUMBER OF KIDS BEING TEST. AND WHICH COMMUNITY REALLY NEED THE FUNDING SO THERE'S REALLY A DISPARITY IN AB PROBLEM AND HOW THEY'RE ALLOCATING THE FUNDS. TO THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH- THIS THIS SITUATION- IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL APARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TESTING EDUCATION PUBLIC HEALTH RISK MITIGATION ABATEMENT. AND THEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SO WITH THAT MEMBERS I'M GONNA HAND OVER MISTER KLEIN AND HILL START STEPPING YOU THROUGH OTHER MATERIALS THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED FROM. PLEASE A GOOD AFTERNOON FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS JONATHAN KLEIN AND I'M THE PRINCIPAL AUDITOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AFTER PERSONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ON CHILDHOOD LEAD LEVELS- AS WE KNOW SOCIETY HIS USE LEAD FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES- THIS INCLUDES PLUMBING PAINT AUTOMOTIVE FUEL AND ALTHOUGH THESE USES HAVE BEEN BANNED IT'S STILL USED IN CAR BATTERIES. ELECTRONICS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE USE IT IS LEAD CONTAMINATION THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THE EFFECTS OF LEAD EXPOSURE WELL KNOWN ON PAGE TWO OF THE DOCUMENT WE PROVIDED YOU. HAVE WE SUMMARIZE HOW ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS CAN LEAD TO REDUCE I Q. HEARING DAMAGE BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS. AND IN EXTREME CASES SEIZURES AND DEATH. AS A STATE AUDITOR DESCRIBED DH CS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL ARE TESTED FOR LEAD AGES ONE AND TWO. BUT HASN'T DONE ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THESE TEST HER. THIS IS AN ONGOING CONCERN- IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND ONE OUR OFFICE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED HOW DID LEAD TESTING. IN THE CHILDHOOD HEALTH AND DISABILITY PREVENTION PROGRAM TESTING RATES HAVE NOT EXCEEDED TESTING RATES IN MEDI CAL WERE ONLY 17% BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO IDENTIFY AND EDUCATE THOSE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN MEDI CAL WHO WERE NOT ORDERING BUT LET LET BLOOD TESTS AS REQUIRED. BUT TODAY TWENTY YEARS AFTER THOSE AUDITS THAT AUDIT SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IMPROVEMENTS IN MY TESTING RATES HAVE BEEN SLOWER. AS SHOWN ON PAGE THREE OF THE DOCUMENT THAT WE PROVIDED TO YOU. AND AS CHAIRPERSON SALAS DESCRIBED. DURING THE LAST NINE YEARS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL DID NOT RECEIVE THE REQUIRED LIKE TESS. ONLY TWENTY FIRST 27% OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING ALL OF THE REQUIRED TESTS. AND THE STATE STILL IS NOT CREATED A PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND EDUCATE THE SPECIFIC PROVIDERS WHO ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE THE STATUS. IN OUR AUDIT PUBLISHED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WEMADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AT FIRST WE RECOMMENDED THE DH CS COMPLETE ITS CURRENT EFFORTS TO MEASURE MANAGED CARE PLANS PERFORMANCE AND IMPOSE SANCTIONS OR PROVIDE INCENTIVES AS APPROPRIATE. ALTHOUGH DHC ESTATES THAT IT HAS IMPLEMENTED AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO DATE IT IS NOT PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT IS MADE ANY LEAD TESTING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. SECOND WE ALSO COMMENDED AGAIN THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT PROVIDING REQUIRED TESTS BE IDENTIFIED AND REMINDED OF THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE STATUS. THIS STRATEGY HAS WORKED IN OTHER STATES AND WOULD LIKELY HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT EFFECT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO OUR REVIEW OF DHT S. WILL ALSO ASSESS THE EFFORT EFFORTS OF THE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM OVERSEEN BY C. PH. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN EXPOSED TO LEAD. AND PROVIDING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THOSE WHO HAVE LEAD POISONING. OUT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER HOOPER HAS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT WE FOUND C. PH. THANK YOU OF FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS JOSH COOPER I WAS THE LEAD ON THIS AUDIT. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT CITY PH IS DATA ON LEAD TEST RESULTS- AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE FOUR OF OUR HAND OUT WE FOUND THAT CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. WE'VE MADE THIS AVAILABLE AS THE STATE AUDITOR SAID ON AN INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD AWARE WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN BY CENSUS TRACT. AND BY LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT. OUT IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PLOTS OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEIR SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. AND WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO ADDRESS THAT MEDICINE CITY PH IMMEDIATELY COMPLETE AND PUBLICIZED AN ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH RISK AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT CITY PH COLLECTS DATA ON LED INSPECTIONS AN ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR RESIDENCES IN THE STATE. OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE USEFUL TO POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS AND RENTERS. AND WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT- TO REQUIRE CITY PH TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN AN ONLINE REGISTRY. THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT WHERE THE RISKS TO CHILDREN OR THE HIGHEST. IS THAT A SO THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS. ON PAGE FIVE. WE HAVE WE LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT SOME OF THE AREAS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND FOUND THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE FOUND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS LOCATED IN JUST TEN APARTMENT COMPLEXES IN THE COUNTY. SOME OF THESE COMPLEXES HAD DOZENS OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS AS THE GRAPHIC SHOWS. THIS SUGGESTED CITY PH IS NOT ADEQUATELY REDUCING RISKS IN THOSE HIGH RISK AREAS- THAT IT IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY. OR ITS CURRENT APPROACH IS TO IT- CONTRACT WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO CONDUCT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT THOSE ARE THOSE IT IS NOT ABLE IT IS CITY PH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT- APPROACH HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THE CITY PH TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT APPROACH AND IF IT DETERMINES THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY. EFFECTIVE THAT IT SHOULD- REPLACE AUGMENT THAT APPROACH WITH PROACTIVE ABATEMENT OF LEAD RISKS IN THE IN THE STATE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT CITY PA TO SPEND- SHOWN POOR MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILD HAD LED PREVENTION PROGRAM. PRIMARILY WE FOUND AS WE SHOW ON PAGE SIX OF THE HAND OUT THE CITY PAGES FAILED TO MEET A NUMBER OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE DO LAST YEAR. THESE INCLUDE POSTING INFORMATION ON THIS WEBSITE ABOUT EFFORTS THAT IS TAKEN TO REDUCE LEAD RISKS IN THE STATE. AND COMPLETING OF. COMPLETING AND PUBLICIZING A BI ANNUAL REPORT WITH INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. IN ADDITION CITY PH IS NOT MET A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP THE REGULATIONS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE TO USE. IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT TO TEST A CHILD FOR ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS WHEN THAT CHILD IS NOT ON MEDICARE. WE GOING TO THIS ON THE NEXT PAGE ON PAGE SEVEN. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S REGULATION REQUIRED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO USE JUSTA SINGLE APPROACH TO DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A CHILD SHOULD BE TESTED FOR LEAD POISONING. THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT CHILD LIVES IN OLDER HOUSING- THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REPAIRS OF RENOVATIONS. WE LOOKED DURING THE COURSE OF OUR AUDIT AT INDIVIDUAL CASES OF ELEVATE CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS AND FOUND A NUMBER OF CASES THAT WERE COSTS BY MORE THAN JUST THIS SINGLE APPROACH. OF FOR EXAMPLE WE FOUND CASES WHERE A CHILD'S PARENTS WORKED WITH LEAD AND THE PARENT WAS BRINGING THAT- EXPOSURE HOME TO THE CHILD. OR CASES- WHICH IS BEEN MENTIONED- HERE ON THE DESK THAT. WHERE CHILDREN WERE EXPOSED TO LEAD THROUGH- THE CANDIES THAT THEY EAT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. OR THROUGH- TOYS OR OR HOME REMEDIES. OTHER STATES INCORPORATE THOSE OTHER RISK FACTORS IN THE REGULATIONS USED TO DETERMINE RISK WHICH WE SHOWING THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE SEVEN. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S FINISHED THE REQUESTED THE RECOMMEND THE REGULATIONS THAT IT IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND INCORPORATE THESE OTHERS SOME OTHER RISK FACTORS. LIKE OTHER STATES DO YOU. ON PAGE EIGHT WE GO ON TO DISCUSS ANOTHER AREA WHERE CITY PAGES DEMONSTRATED POOR MANAGEMENT CITY PH HAS- NOT ADDRESS THE LACK OF INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED BY LABS WITH TEST RESULTS AS WE SHOW IN THE GRAPHIC. LABS SUBMIT TEST RESULTS TO SEE PH IS CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT WHEN THOSE TEST RESULTS DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. THOSE TEST RESULTS FALL INTO A BACKLOG THAT AT ITS CURRENT RATE C. PH WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO YEARS TO PROCESS. OUR RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUIRE LABS TO REPORT SUFFICIENT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION INCLUDING A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER OR MEDI CAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER WITH THOSE LAB TEST RESULTS. FINALLY ON PAGE NINE WE ADDRESS ANOTHER AREA OF MISMATCH OF POOR MANAGEMENT BY C. PH. C. B. H. CURRENTLY- USES AN OUTDATED FORMULA TO DISTRIBUTE- FUNDING TO THE LOCAL PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THIS OUTDATED FORMULA HAS RESULTED IN AN EQUITABLE FUNDING- BEFORE- THE LOCAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING IN OUR GRAPHIC WE SHOW RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAD LESS THAN HALF OF THE CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS AS SACRAMENTO COUNTY BUT RECEIVED FAR MORE IN FINDING. OUR RECOMMENDATION HERE IS THAT CITY PH SHOULD UPDATE IT'S FUNDING METHODOLOGY INCLUDING USING DATE ON THE MOST READ ITS MOST RECENT DATA ON THE COUNT OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. AND THAT IT SHOULD REVISE THESE ALLOCATIONS BEFORE EACH THREE YEAR CONTRACT CYCLE. THANK YOU AND AT THIS TIME WE'RE OPEN TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THAT OVER HERE AT THIS TIME WE GO IN AND- TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DIET SEE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS ON THE DíAS WILL START WITH DOCTOR WHERE THE MOVE TO DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU TO THE ON. TO YOU FOLKS FOR THE FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND- I'M CURIOUS. YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT ON PAGE SIX YEARS THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS NOT MATT- HOW DID SEAT HOW DID THEY RESPOND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THAT I MEAN. POSTING INFORMATION A WEBSITES PRETTY SIMPLE TO DO. UNLESS YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO POST. SO CAN YOU CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH WHAT THE- WHERE THE RESISTANCE IS A WHITE WHITE WHERE WE NOT DOING THIS. SIR THANK YOU- CVH GAVE US VARIOUS REASONS FOR THE DELAYS- MOST OF THEM. BUREAUCRATIC IN NATURE- SAYING THAT- WELL PRIMARILY THAT THEY HAD OF BACON POSITION IN THE- IN THE CHIEF POSITION FOR THEIR LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM- AND THEN THAT THEY HAD APPROVED- CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT THEY WERE TAKING BUT THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIGHER UP APPROVAL BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT PUBLIC. OKAY ALL THE WAY UP IN THE NEXT PANEL MISTER WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT IF I COULD ADD MISLI HERE- WHAT MISTER HOOPER SAID ABSOLUTELY AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS WE HANDED OUT AN EXAMPLE OF CENSUS TRACK INFORMATION AND THAT'S INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ON THEIR WEBSITE IT'S CENTRIST IT'S IN IT IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED SO WE DECIDED TO USE OUR I. T. FOLKS WE GOT SOME INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICE AS WE GOT IN FOR INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. MY I. T. FOLKS WERE ABLE TO- USING G. I. S. AND WORKING THEIR MAGIC- WE WERE ABLE TO USE TABLEAU OTHER INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THOSE SENSORS TAX THIS IS INFORMATION IS REQUIRED POSTED ON WED. ONE OF THE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS- GAVE TO US OR SHARED WITH US IS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO- DISCLOSE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SO THEY FELT THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY DISCLOSED ON THE WEBSITE BUT OUR- POSITION IS THAT'S FINE DO NEED TO BE CAUGHT TEN OF THAT BUT THE AREA THERE ARE WAYS FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO. ADDRESS THE FOR ME AND AS WE DID WITH THE EXAMPLES WE'VE SHARED WITH THE CHAIR THEY'RE VERY SCARCE IN A COMMITTED TO SHOW THOSE SPOTS AND THAT WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION TO. THE PUBLIC S. AS MISTER HOOPER INDICATED WHERE THERE ARE AREAS IN THE STATE THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC THAT WOULD ALSO INFO STRANDED THAT THE STATE WOULD WANT TO EMBARK TO. PROVIDE THE FUNDING TO THE GEN HAVE HI AS OF. IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO HOPEFULLY DO MORE PROACTIVE ABATEMENT AS OPPOSED THIS THAT'S BEING WHERE THE EIGHT ONLY HALF IN HOME WHERE HAVE OUR- TESTED OUR CONCERNS DEPARTMENT IS WAS WITH THREE. TO. PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF A PARTICULAR CHILD WHO HAS BEEN TESTED POSITIVE FOR EXPOSURE LET JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT. THANK YOU MADAM WATER AND THANK YOU YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR ACTUALLY PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION STILL MAINTAINING THAT CONFIDENTIALITY- BE INTERESTING TO HEAR THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE IN THE NEXT PANEL ON THAT. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO SENATOR PAN. THESE THANK YOU- SO WE MAY NOTE IN OUR INTRODUCTIONS AND I THINK YOU IN YOUR PRESENTATION THAT TO US SOME OF THE LOW RATE OF TESTING IS SOMEWHAT CORRELATED WITH THE LACK OF ACTUALLY VISITS FOR RIGHT FOR THE CHECK UPS. CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAKS FOR THE- CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY DID GET THEIR CHECK UPS IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOT TO LEAD TESTING SO IN OTHER WORDS IS OUR ISSUE THAT WE GOT ALL THE KIDS WE SOMEHOW GOT AND WE WERE WORKING WITH DTS ON THIS. GOT ALL THE KIDS WE BUMPED UP THE WELL CHILD GREAT TWO EIGHTY PLUS 8590% IS THE LEAD TESTING RATE GOING TO GO UP TO THE PARALLEL YOU KNOW WITH THAT A PRICE WILL GO UP SOMEWHAT OR DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OF TWELVE ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING SEEN BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT GETTING THEIR LEFT TEST SO IT'S ONE. WAIT FINDINGS WERE REPORTING FOR THE KIDS WHO ACTUALLY WERE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF LIKE TESTING SO. WE WEREN'T WE WEREN'T PASSED WITH COORDINATING BETWEEN THE TO SEE WHAT IT SAID HOW- WE DO HAVE. BY AND- A PERFORM MEASURE THC WILL RAISE THE- THE- TESTING RATE FOR LEAD LEAD OKAY. SO AND THIS IS. VERY SIMILAR TO THE SAME- TO THE RIVER THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD IN THAT THE PREVIOUS OFFICE. AUDIT THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING. SO SYSTEMS SO BASICALLY YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE AUDITS AND THEY WERE LOOKING. PERHAPS YOU SEPARATE DATABASES BUT WHAT I CLEARLY ON SOLUTIONS I MEAN WE CAN LOOK AT WRITING DIFFERENT THINGS. WELL THEN THE SECOND THING IS ACTUALLY YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RISK FACTORS SO I KNOW AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND I. TAKE YOUR MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT- SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THAT- NOW WE DO RIGHT NOW I HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO TEST EVERY CHILD THAT ONE AND- TWO YEARS OF AGE- USE OF. THIS A RISK FACTOR. IS THAT TO DECIDE WHERE TO DO SUBSEQUENT TESTING IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING ARE. HOUSE YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER STATES ARE USING IT SO SOME PEOPLE OF USES AND- WAITED SIDE WHETHER YOU NEED. TO FIRST BASE NOT RAISE YOUR HIGH RISK WE TESTING YOU'RE NOT. BECAUSE THERE IS A YOU KNOW THAT. SAYS LIKE. IS NOW IN. CAUGHT YOUR YOUR- A IT'S THOSE AS- AND HERE'S ANOTHER STICK WITH DO ASK THAT YOU FOR BLOOD SOMETIMES THERE MAY BE A RELUCTANCE RIG. A CHILD WAS TESTED FOR LEAD GOT TO HEMOGLOBIN AT TWELVE MONTHS OF AGE IN THEIR BACK FOR TO YOUR VISIT THE PARENT LOOKS AT YOU SAID. I REALLY NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN WE'RE LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WAS NEGATIVE LAST TIME. AND IT AND SO I I'M JUST ALSO THINKING FROM A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE A- THAT TERMS OF IF YOU'RE LOW RISK DO WE STILL TEST YOU ARE NOT I REALIZE THE GUIDELINES ARE RIGHT NOW YES YOU. STILL TEST TO DO ONE YEAR TWO YEARS. BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO HAVE OTHER STATES HAVE USED THEIR RISK FACTOR- VERSUS- WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SHORT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND SO- AS YOU MENTIONED THE REQUIREMENT RIGHT NOW IS FOR TESTING ALL CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO. IF THEY'RE IN A CAL OR RECEIVING- ANOTHER OF BENEFIT FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN. THE REQUIREMENTS PAGE SEVEN IS A REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN THOSE PROGRAMS. SO IF IN ORDER TO. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A CHILD IS AT RISK THE FIRST- FACTOR THE U. CONSIDERS IS A CHILD IN THAT THAT THAT PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE SECOND WOULD BE THE RISK FACTORS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN REGULATION AND RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST THAT SINGLE RISK FACTOR. ABOUT DOES A CHILD LIVE IN OR SPEND TIME. IN OLDER HOUSING. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY. BECAUSE HE'S IS YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE READY AND MEDI CAL AND I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT SO ARE YOU LOOKING JUST AT MEDI CAL WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS ARE YOU LOOKING A PRIVATE INSURANCE AS WELL. SO THE RISK FACTORS ON PAGE SEVEN APPLIED ONLY TO CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN MEDI CAL. OKAY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PARENTS CAN REFUSE THESE TESTS YES RIGHT. OKAY SO IF I COULD ADD DOCTOR PAN SO THE STATISTICS THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS WE WERE SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO LOOK AT CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL SO OF THAT NOT THE NINE YEAR WINDOW. THERE WERE TWO PONT NINE MILLION KIDS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE AT AGED AGES ONE AND TWO TO BE TESTED WHAT SOUND AND YOU SAW IN THE PACKET IS. THERE'S YOU KNOW CLOSE TO TWO MILLION OF THOSE CHILDREN THAT DID NOT RECEIVE BOTH OR OR ONE OF THE TESTS THE REASON WE THINK THIS- ADDING THESE ADDITIONAL FACTORS IN THE REGULATIONS IS YOU'RE STILL GOING TO INFORM THIS WILL INFORM PROVIDERS. TO NOT JUST ASK ABOUT THE ONE RISK FACTOR FOR A METAL CAL CHAU CHILD WHO IS A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER FOR THAT CHILD BUT THEN FOR THOSE PROVIDERS WHO SEE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN MEDI CAL. THIS WOULD BE INFORMATIVE TO THEM IT IS A CHILD THAT PERHAPS IS EXPOSED TO ONE THESE ONE OF THESE OTHER RISK FACTORS THAT MAKE MAKE. PROVIDER DECIDE WE NEED TO TEST THE CHILD EVEN THOUGH THE CHILD'S NOT A MEDIC WELL IT'S NOT BANNED THAT THAT CHILD TESTED THIS. THIS WOULD BE USED FOR BOTH AND IT WOULD BURKE AND SHIP IN WHO ARE NOT PART OF CAL SO WE WOULD. FACTORS YOU'RE GOING TO PENSION TEST CHILL WHO ARE NOT IN MAY CAL MAY BE AT RISK OF EXPOSURE LEAD POISONING I HOPE THAT HELP TO ALL RIGHT I KNOW THAT THAT'S HELPFUL- YEAH AND I DON'T CALL TOUGH TALK MY HEAD I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK BACK AT SO IF YOU SHEET THESE ITEMS I DON'T OF ALL THESE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN RECOMMENDED BY A PUBLIC HEALTH YOU KNOW- SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF LOOK AT ACTUAL RISK FACTORS- CERTAINLY LET IS EXTREMELY SERIOUS SO WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO SCREEN LEAD. I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT AND- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS PEOPLE WANT US TO SCREEN FOR AND SO IN THE END FOR A YOU KNOW SHE ACTUALLY VISIT YOU KNOW WHAT GETTING A PENNY TO THE PARENT COMPANY THINGS LISTED TO CHECK OFF ANY QUESTIONS THEY HAVE THE ANSWER IT'S AT AROUND- WE HAVE TO I JUST WANNA BE CONSCIOUS OF THAT OTHER SIDE THAT BURDEN. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS. IT'S SO SERIOUS SO I APPRECIATE THIS SO THE ONE TO BE SURE TO SEE. LATER WITH WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS INTO OF WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST. YEAH THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE THAT ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. SCREEN FOR LEAD TOXICITY. AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY USED TO PRACTICE IN THE AREA OF WHEN I WAS A TRAINING AT WHICH HAD A LOT OF LET HOUSING. SO THANKS RIGHT AND TO. VERY WE DID INCLUDE IN THE REPORT IN THE INTRODUCTION WE LOOKED AT WHAT CDC RAT OUT THERE. AS FAR AS GUIDANCE AND ALSO OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE USE THAT GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE WHAT. SHOULD POTENTIALLY BE OTHER RISK FACTORS TO US ASSESS AND THAT'S WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES WERE DOING SO WE DID RELIANCE ON RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RIGHT THANK SENATOR YEAH WITH YOU I THINK BY SOME FORM HAVE THAT DATA AND THOSE HOT SPOT. RIGHT AND I BELIEVE ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA- THIS WAS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO SEVENTY NINE. IDENTIFIES AS THINGS DIVIDE. THAT SUPPLIED WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO SENATOR DOLLIES AND MORE LOCKED IN CENTER. CHAU LEVEL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THAT SENATOR DOLLINGER YOU CHAIRMAN. SO ON ON PAG SEVEN I HAVE ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS. IN NEW YORK DAVE CHAPPELLE WALK THIS. AND WE CHECK ONE BOX. SO WHAT IT WILL ARE THEY FIND WE DO DO WE ARE ANY OF. FOR ME AND WHAT WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE AND WHO WHO THEY'RE ALL HITTING. IN THEIR TEST AND I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO. GO THROUGH THE PAMPHLET THAT UNIT OUT SO IF IT'S IN THERE I BY ME AND MR BUT I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION. SO WE LOOK AT- WE LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES WERE USING IN THEIR- LEAD QUESTIONNAIRE- WE LOOKED AT THEIR TESTING RATES. OTHER THAN THAT WE DIDN'T GO IN- VERY DEEPLY INTO- THE DATA THAT OTHER STATES MAYOR OR MAY NOT HAVE OUR OUR- OUR AUTO. FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF OUR TESTING RATE THAN CALIFORNIA- WE ALSO KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH NEW YORK HAS TESTED HAS CHECKED ALL OF THE BOXES. THERE MAY BE. OTHER AREAS. THAT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE IT THIS LOOKS THAT THAT THEY COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AND FOR YOU KNOW WHIPS. DEMOGRAPHIC THEY WERE. WITH IT REALLY FOCUSED ON WANTED TO YOUR WITH A FOCUSED ON. THE UNDERSERVED. COMMUNITIES I MEAN I KNOW THAT IT FROM NEARLY POSITIVE BUT IT'S ALSO WANTED TWO YEAR OLDS IN NEW YORK. OKAY MY SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU HAVE. THIS VERY. STARTLING TO ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO YEARS TO GET THE BACKLOG OF TESTS THAT ARE. OUT THERE SO CAN YOU ELABORATE MAYBE ON WHY THAT IS AND IS IT A LACK OF FUNDING IS IT. I MEAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO HAVE A TEST IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT ANALYZE IT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT. RIGHT AND THIS THE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THIS IS WHAT ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S CITY PH HAD. THE PROBLEM HERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION WITH THESE LEAD TEST RESULTS. AND THE- WHEN THE LABS ART REQUIRE AREN'T REPORTING FULL. CLEAR IDENTIFICATION ARE ENDED IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WITH THOSE LAB TEST RESULTS CITY PAGES DATA SYSTEM. CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS THAT WHICH MEANS THE LOCAL AGENCIES AREN'T ABLE TO IDENTIFY OKAY HERE'S THAT THE LEAD TEST RESULT. WAS LOOKING FOR- THIS WHAT I NEEDED TO HELP OUT THIS SPECIFIC CHILD. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PIECES TO THAT PUZZLE- AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION ADDRESSES THE VERY FIRST PIECE- AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THERE'S THE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I WOULD SPECIFICALLY TARGET TO C. PH ON THIS ISSUE. WELL AS YOU KNOW OUR- JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE SHORTCOMINGSARE AND THEN TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND TYPICALLY I WOULD SAY 99% OF THE PEOPLE AT LEAST VISIT MY OFFICE ALWAYS NEED MORE RESOURCES TO GET WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE TRYING TO GET DONE DONE. AND I ALWAYS COME BACK WITH SOMETIMES IT'S NOT. ALWAYS THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IT'S SOMETIMES OUR POLICIES IN THIS BUT IN THIS CASE I'M CONCERNED THAT MAYBE OUR POLICIES IN RESOURCES ARE A LINE BECAUSE- I KNOW THAT. WE HAVE IN AREAS THAT WE KNOW WE HAD HOT SPOTS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND I WORKED I WAS INNOCENTLY ON A BILL TO. ADDRESS WHAT WE HAD IT EXCITED BECAUSE WE KNEW THERE WAS A THE- PROBLEM THERE BUT FOR US WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I THINK IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION. CENTER DOLLY ASKED WE WERE LOOKING AT THE OTHER STATES I LOOKED AT THE AUDIT ON PAGE TWENTY THREE YOU HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE STATE TO WORK CALIFORNIA RANKS. OBVIOUSLY NEW YORK- PENNSYLVANIA WAS RANKED REALLY AYE BUT WERE THERE ARE FACTORS YOU WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PRACTICES A WHY. THOSE STATES WERE ABLE TO TEST AT SUCH A HIGHER LEVEL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AGAIN OUR OUR AUDIT FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIAN WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. OKAY WHAT DOES RESERVE MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A FEW QUESTIONS THAT MAYBE OBSERVATION FROM. WE HAD A PROCESS CALLED RESULTS ORIENTED GOVERNMENT- WE HAD OUR DEPARTMENTS PUT TOGETHER BUSINESS PLANS AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND THIS IS HOW MANY WE DO AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE DOING IT AND THIS IS WHY WE JUSTIFY. OUR BUDGET AND SO WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND IF THERE STAFF PROPERLY OR DOING MOSTLY DOING. AND SO THIS IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO. IT'S AS- SENATE DOLLY SAID CHECK BOXES AND MAKE SURE YOU'VE DONE CERTAIN THINGS ARE. JUST SORT OF CURIOUS YOU KNOW IT WITH WITH MEASURING THINGS THEN YOU MANAGE IT. SO ON BLOOD TESTS YOU CAN REQUEST THAT CERTAIN THINGS WE LOOK FOR- THE TECHNOLOGIES. QUITE AMAZING- AND I'M JUST WONDERING. I GUESS FIRST QUESTION IS THIS JUST A CHECK WITH SUGGEST LET'S MAKE SURE WE GET THE BLOOD TEST SO WHERE WHERE'S THE FAILURE. I WAS AT DIFFICULT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD QUESTION FOR THE OTHER AGENCIES I THINK THAT WE COULD DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT'S BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WHERE THESE ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY'RE GETTING PAID. YOU KNOW I'M MOUNT IT'S NOT FOR SERVICE THEY- RIGHT A PREVENTATIVE SERVICES- AND PART OF PREVENTIVE CARE IS- PROVIDING THESE TESTS FOR CHILDREN MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO. WHERE WE SAW THE PROBLEM IS TO. SERVICES IS NOT MONITORING THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MAKE SURE THOSE PLANS ARE ENSURING THAT THOSE PROVIDERS ARE FIGHTING ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT. CHILDREN MEDI CAL ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE IN PARTICULAR- TESTING OF CHILLED YOU JUST WANT TO. FOR CLOSURE TO LEAD SO THE HEALTHCARE IS NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB MAKING MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE THIS INFORMATION. BECAUSE THE LACK. PORT ST OUT FOR THAT THE MANAGED PLANS ARE ON TOP OF THE PROVIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REMINDED YOU ARE WIRED TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL- AND IF YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING SERVICES WE NEED TO HAVE AN AT ITS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COURSE IS WAS MODEL BY CONTRACT WHICH- FOR THE MET. FOR THE HANDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED IN THIS IS PART OF WHAT WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR PREVIOUS AUDIT. THAT THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT MEDI CAL CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THEY SHOULD BE RECEIVING NO SO YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE. THAT THE STATE OF FOR TO HOLD THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE WHICH WILL INCENTIVIZE THEM TO HOLD THEIR PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE MATERIAL THAT WE WERE GIVEN BY THE COMMITTEE- ON PAGE FOUR IT SAYS- THAT D. EIGHT C. S. HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN DEVELOPING. IF PROGRAM EIGHT. WHAT'S AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHAT IS IT ANY IN THIS CASE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS EXTRA MONEY FOR TESTING. SO AS A AS A PROVIDER- REPORTS THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED- THESE LEAD TESTS- DHS IS GOING TO PAY MORE MONEY- IN IT'S- A REIMBURSEMENT TO THAT THAT TO THAT PLAN WHICH WOULD THEN GO TO THE- YOU'LL BE. REWARDED MONETARILY FOR DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO WHAT ARE YOU PENALIZED IF YOU DIDN'T. CAN YOU PAY. A BONUS BACK CERTAIN DTS ALSO HAS- IN ITS DEVELOPMENT AS A PERFORMANCE- METRIC AND UP IT HAS THE MEANS TO- ISSUE SANCTIONS- IF PLANS ARE MEETING THE- THE TARGETS THAT THEY SHOULD BE REACHING FOR THEM JUST MY LAST COUPLE QUESTIONS- GOOD WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. ULTIMATELY IT IS THE EXCESSES RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN AND MEDICAL AYE GETTING THESE TESTS SO WE DON'T HAVE A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT. WE HAVE SECRETARIES WE HAVE A GOVERNOR BUT I YOU KNOW I WAS TOLD THIS BE A COMMITTEE THAT. WE MEET THREE TIMES A YEAR. AND WE'RE MEETING THREE TIMES A WEEK. AND THE REPORT SIR REALLY DISCOURAGING. AND IF THIS IS A SAMPLING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA I'M GETTING PRETTY NERVOUS PRETTY UPSET IN FACT I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS ALLEGE THAT ARE NO LONGER AN EXACT. AS I WAS SAYS COUNTY SUPERMARKET HAD- SO FORGIVE ME FOR BEING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED BUT- I'M LOOKING AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL I I'M SAYING HOW DO I IMPROVE. BUREAUCRACY HOW DO WE- BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND DO IT WITH EXCELLENCE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS DO WE REORGANIZE DO WE LOOK AT THE ORG CHART DO WE OUT SOURCE. THESE ARE LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT QUESTIONS BUT HOW DO WE GET GOVERNMENT TO DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND DOING IT. SO THAT. NO WE DON'T ALWAYS DMV JOKES. WELL I SAID SENATOR I THINK THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS LIKE THIS HELPS CERTAINLY I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE PRESENTING IN THE NEXT THE NEXT PANEL THE OTHER ASPECT IS THAT I THINK WORKS- QUITE WELL THE FOLLOW UP PROCESS THAT MIGHT. BE WE'VE ISSUE THE POOR IN JANUARY- EARLY JUST READ THE SIXTY RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE RECOMMEND. THAT WERE MADE RESPECTIVE APARTMENT WHERE LOOK THAT IN. WILL BE POSTING THAT ON OUR WEBSITE THEN WE FOLLOW UP IN SIX MONTHS WE FOLLOW UP IN A YEAR IF INPUT IF RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED AFTER YEAR WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP AND WE ACTUALLY. HIGHLIGHT THOSE AGENCIES A SPEC REPORT THAT JUST IDENTIFIES HERE ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED ITS PLACED IT HERE WE FOLLOW UP. YEARS COME UP FOR YEARS CUENTA. EXACT SOMETHING THAT WOULD HOLD COUNTY. I THINK SOME OF THE RE. THAT ARE AND OF THE LEDGE. THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED HELP AS FAR AS REQUIRING LABS THEY REPORT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO GET PAID THEY REPORT. IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ARE THE MEDI CAL- IDENTIFIER. IF THE LABS WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT AND AN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO I'D BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT CHILD- YOUR GOING TO BE ABLE TO- PROCESS MORE SO SHE WON'T HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS. WAITING TO BE PROP. MANUALLY BY FOLKS AT PARTMINER OF PUBLIC HEALTH- SO I THINK THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE- THE SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN- INTRODUCED DOES ADDRESS MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE LEAD. TO BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S TO BE PATCHED TORY CHANGES. OUGHT THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM AND ALSO- ALLOW FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MORE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE SOME THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE ON THE WEBSITE THAT'S WHAT ONE. DOCTOR WHICH QUESTION. IT DEPARTMENT IS RECALL. IN THE NATION WITH RESPECT BACK ON THE WEBSITE AND THEY CAN'T ARGUE WITH ANY OF YOU TODAY AND SAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. WE USED THEIR DATA WE USE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH TOGETHER AGGREGATED DATA BY CENSUS TRACT DID IT BY ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DISTRICT SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THAT WE DID THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT. I THINK THE- OVERSIGHT HERE. THIS MEMBERS ASKED OFFICE QUESTIONS ASKED THE DEPARTMENT QUESTIONS I THINK WE'LL HOPEFULLY HOLD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTABLE SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE- IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA AND OTHER AREAS THAT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE ASK MY ALL. TO LOOK AT. SO THAT'S HOW I WANT TO. WORK MISTER HOOPER AND MISTER KLEIN THANK YOU AYE AYE REPORTS STRODE CANDID IS. TELLING WHAT IS AN ALL IN THAT. IT TAKES BRAVERY. BUT YOU'RE NOT THE CEO YOU'RE NOT THE YOU NOT THIS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE COULD PUT THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY BURDEN ON YOU AS WELL BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING WILLING TO STEP UP TO IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME TO MAYBE SIT DOWN AND SEE A BETTER WAY TO RUN A SEARCH BUT I AM IMPRESSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE THE ONLY THING I BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES WE CAN ALSO. HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE IS WELL FOR THE DEPARTMENT STRUCTURE THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. ESPECIALLY IF IT'S MANDATED THROUGH LEGISLATION- WITH THAT I WILL REMIND MEMBERS THAT WE ARE NOW AT AN HOUR OF JUST THE FIRST PANEL WE STILL OF THE DEPARTMENTS COMING UP. WHICH BASED ON QUESTION SO FAR HAVE A LOT OF- INTEREST TO PROVIDE. SO WE WILL MOVE TO SENATOR MITCHELL INTO SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND WITH THAT I WILL HOLD THE- LOCAL MY QUOTE. TO DEPARTMENT. ONE IS THAT PRO. YOU WILL. FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE. ON THE TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY I WHAT MORE IMPORTANT ME IS TO. AN ULTIMATE WE MAY BE. AND SO FAR WE'RE GONNA FOCUS RESOURCES THAT'S RIGHT PUT THE PARTICULARLY SINCE I REPRESENT. THE CENSUS. THAT'S REFLECTED HERE. AND WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR AND PARK I KNOW THAT COMMUNITY I KNOW BUT THERE'S ALLN COLDER. AFTER L. DRILL NEAR THAT'S OF ACTIVITY GOING ON THERE WERE PEOPLE. OR PEOPLE UNTIL PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE. BUT WHAT STRIKES ME. REFLECT THE- DOESN'T IT WESTERN CENTER FIVE ON THE THIRTY YEARS WHEN I A LOT OF LET POLICY. I AM STRUCK BY THIS LIST ON PAGE SEVEN- AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WAS THERE A POINT IN TIME WHEN WE DID CONSIDER PROXIMITY I'M TO LET PRODUCING FACILITIES AND RESIDENCY HI RECIPE CALLED AS A RISK FACTOR. THIS LIST STRIKES ME. IN AND IT DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH MY OWN RECOLLECTION SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT TIME WE DID THAT- SO MY RECOLLECTION OF THE LAW IS THAT IT HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE IT. OR TH REGULATION I SHOULD SAY IS THAT IT HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE IT WAS PASSED INTERESTING THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR- WITH THAT CENTER LEYVA WILL HOLD A QUESTION FOR THE NEXT PANEL. CENTER FOR TITLE FOR THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCLUDING REMARKS IF NOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL NO NO. SHAKE SHAKE QUESTIONS MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. LOOK AT THIS TIME WE WILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER THREE COMMENTS AND RESPONSES TO THE AUDIT. WE HAVE DOCTOR BRADLEY GILBERT DIRECTOR OF FORTY MILLION HEALTH SERVICES AND CHASING COOPER CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THE STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SIR. AND WE ARE MONICA MARIAH BUT I LIVE DE DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH- IF YOU COULD PLEASE APPROACH THE DIOCESAN. PERHAPS WE PERCEIVE THAT ORDER PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBERS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M DOCTOR BRAD GO OVER YOUR NEW DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ME I'M A PHYSICIAN WHO WAS TREATED MEDI CAL INDIVIDUALS. I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN TWO COUNTIES. AND THE CEO OF INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS ONE OF THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. RESIDENTS. WE TAKE THIS REALLY SERIOUSLY. I'M A PHYSICIAN I UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS IN CHILDREN IN TERMS OF ALL THE THINGS I'VE BEEN BROUGHT OUT TODAY. IMPACTS ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S ACTUALLY NEW CORRELATIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO LEAD- BECOMING A MORE COMMONLY PART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS ADOLESCENCE DUE TO BEHAVIOR DID OF EVER ISSUES. SO WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT THE AUDIT RESULTS IN THE AMOUNT OF TESTING THAT'S OCCURRING IS UNACCEPTABLE. THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS AT THE LEVEL OF POSITIVE TESTING IS GOING DOWN. BUT IF WE'RE NOT STING CHILDREN WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A CHILD OUT THERE THAT HAS AN ELEVATED BLOOD LEVEL THAT WE HAVEN'T TESTED. SO AS HOUSING STOCK TURNS OVER IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THERE ARE MORE RISKS THAN JUST HOUSING STOCK- BUT- YOU KNOW. HOUSING IS A BIG PIECE OF IT WITH THE LEAD PAINT. AND THAT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR- BUT AGAIN. SUPPOSE THAT HASN'T BLOOD LEVEL THEN WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. WE DID SIMILAR SIXTY DAYS STATUS UPDATE TO THE AUDIT- WE BELIEVE RUN SCHEDULE WILL TALK ABOUT ONE ITEM THAT- BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING WITH COVERT NINETEEN WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE. FRONT WE NEED TO WORK CALL WITH CD PH. ONE OF THE REAL KEYS HEROES ALIGNMENT THAT WERE ALIGNED WITH CD PH THAT WE'RE GETTING THE TEST RESULTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A HIGH RISK AREA. FEDERAL THERE'S A- DOWN TO THE HEALTH PLANS AS THE AUDITOR SIDE. AND EVENTUALLY TO THE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ARE SEEING THE CHILDREN OR NOT SEEING THE CHILDREN. IN TERMS OF DOING LEAD TESTING SO REALLY THE ALIGNMENT IS REALLY REALLY KEY IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS. HI CHOOSE A DOG PANNIER ABOUT IF THE CHILD DOES NOT COME IN FOR A WELL CHILD VISIT THEN IT'S UNLIKELY THEY'RE GONNA GET ALL THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT LEAD TEST I MEAN IF THEY CONVINCE YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT TO STICK OF. COURSE YOU CAN CHáVEZ CAN DO THAT. THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT COMING IN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET TESTED AND SO I DON'T. KNOW THAT I CAN SAY FOR THE RECORD NUMBER MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE THAT THOSE TWO WOULD GO TOGETHER. SO ME AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT'S REALLY ABOUT SEEING HOW WE CAN GET THE ALIGNMENT ALL THE WAY DOWN- AND CAN I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW JC BURGERS ARE NEW MEDICAID DIRECTOR WE UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS GOING TO WORK HARD. I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT ENJOY- WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE HERE AND MONOCLE TALK ABOUT THAT BUT SHE'S INVOLVED IN A COURSE TO COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE AND VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THAT'S AVAILABLE. I'M GONNA HANDED OVER TO THE- SUPER SOME OF THE DETAILS BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS- AND CONCERNS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MANY OF YOU ALREADY. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED YES THANK YOU JC COOPER STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- JUST TO REITERATE DOCTOR GILBERT'S. ON WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY WILL BE ACTING IMMEDIATELY UPON. ON THE AUDITS RECKON. I WILL WALK THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF BONTA HOW WE ARE. ON TO THE NATION'S. ON A- LISTING ALL TYPE ON A- THIS IN. ONCE WE WILL BE EDUCATE BENEFITS. OF THEIR RIGHT TO THESE SIR INCLUDING SIR BUT ALSO AND LET THINGS. IN THE NOTICES OF WHICH IS A MEDI CAL COVERED SERVICE WE ALSO WOULD BE HOLDING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE I'M- VERY MEMBERS. ON THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES LIKE LEAD TESTING WE WILL BE ARMING MEDI CAL PROVIDERS OF INFORMATION WHICH IS WHICH OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SEAT BEST. HAVE NOW. TO THE THEY ACT ON THAT VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; LEE&lt;/c&gt; CLOSING THE- AND THEN WE WILL BE IN M. IMPLEMENTING NEW CHANGES TO OUR MONITOR POLITY OVERSIGHT. AND I'LL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO THE EMENDATION BY THE AUDITOR. PORT WHERE THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD REMAIN CENTER ROOM TO GET TO LEAD TESTING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE MISSED THEIR REQUIRED TEST- IN EARLY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THEN THIS MONTH THE DEPARTMENT HAS STARTED MAILING TO ALL OF OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE CHILDREN ABOUT FIVE MILLION IT WILL ROLL OUT OVER AN EIGHT WEEK PERIOD. ON PATIENT ABOUT RIGHT TO PROVIDE SERVICES PUTTING A TEST THE VAGUELY LIST KNOWS NO. ARMING FAMILIES AND AS WITH THE OF THE BILL THEY ARE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VERY COOL FOR THE TO HAPPEN I'M WE ARE AT WORK NOT WE WILL BE WHAT'S CALLED A CALL HIM. SOMETHINGTHAT WE TO DO WE WERE LARGE CHANGES AND THEN PROGRAM MANAGED AND REACH. TO ON HOLD BECAUSE OF KOBE NINETEEN IN THE KRONA VIRUS WE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE CONFLICTING INFORMATION WHICH IS TENTATIVELY COMING OUT FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES. IN REGARD TO ACCESS TO SERVICES AT THIS TIME SO WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE ALL OF THE MAILERS BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT'S AND- TO ARM. AND FISHERIES WITH THAT IN. WE WILL NOT CONVENE ACTUAL. PAIN FROM CARE PLANS BENEFIT YOUR AND- WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION FROM PUBLIC KALI IN THE AND STATEWIDE. TO THE- SO WE- JUST MAKE SURE I'VE WAS CLEAR AWARE OF THE TODAY. BUT WE GET WEIRD WE WOULD. THE PAINS FOR OUR MEDI CAL. THE NEXT RECOMMEND. HAS TO DO WITH PLAN AND PROVIDER- OVERSIGHTS SO BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE SUBMITTING TO CMS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT CONTRACT AMEND. THOSE MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS IN THOSE CONTRACTS WE WILL MAKE CLEAR. BUILDING PUBLIC. BUT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO LED LIGHTS AND THAT THEY ARE DOING THE PROPER OVERSIGHT ENSURE THAT THEY GET THOSE SCREENINGS WE WILL ALSO RELEASE WAS CALLED IN ALL PLAN LETTERED AS THEY- ALLEGE USED TO GIVE I DO TO MEASURE. BOB BERRIES CONTRA ARE. S. PIECES SO THEY ON IN THE DETAILS OF THOSE WERE ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL RECEIVE THAT IT WILL BE WORST. TO THEN EACH QUARTER I REACH OUT TO ANY CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE- WHO HAVE NO RECORD. CAN CLOSELY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH TO IT GET THEIR DATA- AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE THAT BECAUSE IF THEY RECEIVE A CONTACT. THAT SIT NEXT MAKES IT REQUIRED IN IT'S IN IN ALL PLAN LETTER IT'S ALSO VERY CRITICAL THAT THEY HAVE A WAY OF REACHING OUT TO PROVIDERS TO. THE VISUALS THAT YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVE NOT RECEIVED A BLOOD SCREENING. I'M IN WE WILL BE CLOSELY TO GET INFORMATION TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS REGARDING THAT. WE WOULD NOT THOUGH- IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THEY REQUESTED OR- RECOMMENDED THAT WE REACH OUT TO PROVIDERS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. DEPARTMENT HAVE MODIFIED THAT QUARTERLY BASED ON WHAT I JUST SAID MAINLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO GIVE PROVIDERS TIME NOTICE TO DO OUTREACH TO GET INDIVIDUALS IN AND ACTUALLY BE. TO RUN TESTS ON THOSE CAN. WITH THE- CONDITION SO WE HAVE MODIFIED THAT TO. IS WE WANT TO BE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT DO YOU REGARD NOT RECOMMENDING. WE ALSO WILL REQUIRE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MEET WITH DEPARTMENT THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR HOW THEY WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ORDERLY PORTING PROCESS OUT REACH YOU THERE RIGHT AND TO THEIR PROVIDERS. WELL AS IN ADDITION OUTRAGE EFFORT IN THIS CASE. THEN THE NEXT THE NEXT OF PIECES THAT WE WOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IS THAT THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR ANNUAL AUDIT TOOL SO THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED TO PULL ON WHEN WE ARE GOING AND DOING LIKE. THE MEASURE OR PROVIDER ON HIS BERKELEY IT'S JUST BEEN AN OVERSIGHT OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES- WE WILL BE EXPLICITLY ADDING IN THE BLOOD THAT SCREEN PORTION INTO TO. BUT IT'S ARE DONE. BY THE TIME WE JUST MAKE SURE IT IS THAT THIS WOULD NOT BEING ADDED IN THAT SPECIFIC ITEM AND TOLD TO OF TWO TWENTY. TO ALLOW CARE PLANS PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS IMPLEMENTED AND THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE AND IN THEIR SEASON PROCEDURES. THE LAST RECORD ASIAN THAT CAME FROM THE AUDIT REPORT HAS TO DO WITH PERFORMANCE AND MONITORING DH CS WILL RELEASE ITS FIRST VERSION OF THE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES UTILIZATION REPORT BY DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WE INTEND TO INCLUDE THE BLOOD THAT SCREENING- IN THIS REPORT. THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT AS YOURS THAT YOU WILL START REPORTING ON A REGULAR BASIS THE FIRST ONE IS THE EXISTING HE DOES MEASURE- THAT IS USED NATION WIDE- ACROSS THE NATION. HOWEVER THAT PARTICULAR- MEASURE DOESN'T ALIGN THE STATE LAW IN CALIFORNIA STATE LAW REQUIRES TESTING AT ONE INTO THE NATIONAL JR IS ANY UNDER THE AGE OF TWO SO DOESN'T HAVE A DIRECT CONNECTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S. WHEN IT INTO THE NO MATTER. WHICH I THAT IS IMPORTANT ONE TO AT BECAUSE THE DOES A LOT US TO LOOK ACROSS THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE CONSISTENCY WHAT HOW THEY ARE DOING IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE A BENCHMARK. TO SEE WHAT HOW WE ARE MEASURE UP WITH OTHER STATES SO IT'S TO MEASURE BUT IN ORDER. SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO COMPLY WITH STATE AND- THE- WILL BE. WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN THE DEPARTMENT TO HELP IT THE CALIFORNIA MEASURE WHERE WE ALSO REPORT AT AGE ONE ENDED AGE TO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO YOU IN REGARDS TO WHERE ARE IN EATING THIS RESPONSE. LASTLY I WOULD MENTION- THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE LOOK AT pPURCHASED- OR PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED BLOOD SCREENING IS A PART OF OUR PROP FIFTY SIX VALUE BASED PAYMENT. PROPOSAL I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR CMS IS APPROVAL OR THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT'S APPROVAL ON THAT BASEMENT PROPOSAL BUT THE DEPARTMENT HAS FULL INTENT IN INCLUDING THAT THAT SCREENING ON THOSE THAT THAT PAYMENT I I'M PROCEDURES. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU PLEASE. REVENUE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MONICA MORALIS I'M HERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU HEARD DOCTOR ANGEL COULDN'T BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY SO I'LL BE HERE REPRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT. HE PUSHED BUTTON TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE AS WELL THAT WE DO TAKE THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY- OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. A CLIP PROGRAM TO REALLY ELEVATE THE WHAT THAT WILL DO IN THEIR- AND- YOU KNOW LET ME HOPEFULLY PROVIDE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AS WELL TO HELP SET THE CAR. STE IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE ORDER. THE RIGHT NOW AND JUST SEE IF I GET A SENSE OF. PROCESSES OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND A LEAD TESTS- ANNUALLY THAT REPRESENT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN- IN-  REPORTS FROM OVER FOUR HUNDRED LABORATORIES PERTAINING TO THESE TESTS. OTHER TOTALLY POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM CONTRACTS WITH FIFTY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO PROVIDE THE CASE MANAGEMENT. AND THEN THE STATE CLIP PROGRAM- DOES THE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR THE REST STATE LEVIN- REMAINING JURISDICTIONS. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD OVER EIGHT THOUSAND. OF WITH LAB TESTS THAT DEMONSTRATED ELEVATED BUT LET BLOOD THAT LEVELS- IN AGAIN AS A REMINDER WE WORK WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- SOME OF THE CLIP PROGRAM SUPERVISED THE CASE MANAGEMENT- PERTAINING TO THIS TO ALSO DO. SOME OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND TO DO YOU OF OUR REGION FAMILY- EDUCATION AND TRAINING. WELL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE AUDIT FINDINGS SO- REALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE AREAS THAT NEED TO CAN TO WORK ON WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS SOME WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. REALLY TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE AT IN TERMS OF MEETING. THE AUDITOR'S INUNDATIONS SO AS EACH YES MENTIONED WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER AND ART STAFF MEET I DON'T KNOW PROBABL MONTHLY TO START REALLY LOOKING AT THE DATA PROBABLY. DEPEND CONTINUE TO ANNA YOU KNOW OF DATA AND TRYING TO DO THE MATCHING WE WILL BE USING THAT DATA TO THEN DO TARGETED OUTREACH IF WE GET IT FOR EXAMPLE ZIP CODE OR BY- A PLAN WILL BE ABLE TO THEN WORK WITH DH CS TO TARGET OR ARE BOTH FOR THE INTEREST BUT ALSO THE- CAN. I'M SHOULDN'T ONE OF THE BIGGEST SETBACKS THAT WE HAVE WORKED OR- YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS OUR ANTIQUATED DATA SYSTEM WE COLUMN RASCAL RASCALS MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD AND IT REALLY WAS MORE OF A REPOSITORY SYSTEM THAN A REPORTING SYSTEM SO WE ARE TRYING TO RIGHT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WHAT WE CALL THE HELP PROCESSES TO CREATE A NEWS. OR ARE LEAD PROGRAM AND WORK THAT SHIELD. WELL WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IS WE HAVE CREATED A MAP OUTLINING THE AREAS- WITH HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OLD WITH ELEVATED- BUT LEVEL CENTS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE ALREADY AND WE'RE FINALIZING THE BINDER REPORTS WHICH WILL INCLUDE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR'S INCLUDING YOU KNOW ALLEN ZIP AND ALSO THE RISK FACTORS- RESPECT IS. CODE EXCUSE ME. MOREOVER CITY PAGES TAKING MULTIPLE STEPS REALLY WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH- CLIP PROGRAMS WE ARE I JUST UPDATED THEIR SCOPES OF WORK SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO INCLUDE KEY VALUE ASIAN EXPECTATIONS AND- INDICATORS SO THAT ARE DEALING WITH ABATEMENT THAT ARE DEALING WITH CASE MANAGEMENT- WERE ALSO. LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN- BASED ON THE BURDEN OR BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEVELS THINK ABOUT OUR FUNDING FORMULA AND HOW WE CAN BETTER. S. WITH THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS THAT WE- ARE ABLE TO MANAGE OR OR HAVE ACCESS TO. AND THEN WE WILL- STARTING IN JANUARY WE STARTED TO DO THREE AT A MINIMUM THREE VISITS A MONTH TO OUR LOCAL CLIPS JUST TO WORK WITH THEM LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK. I'M ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE- LIST OF FUNDING FOR ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SOMETHING THE AS- MANY OF YOU MIGHT KNOW IT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO ABATEMENT A HOME ONE HOME BY ITSELF AVERAGES ABOUT. TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE A LIST WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAP INTO FEDERAL. RESOURCES AND ALSO LOCAL RESOURCES TO DO SOME OF THAT. YOU KNOW KERN GOING THROUGH THE TO PROCESS TO DO FOR PERTAINING TO RESPECT TO THE RESPECTIVE CRITERIA AND A LITTLE BIT TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS CURRENTLY AS WE HEARD OF FROM THE AUDITOR THEY'RE REALLY JUST ASKING DO YOU LIVE IN A HOME THAT'S OLDER THAN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND THEN UP QUITE LOOK AT THINGS THE NECK TO FREE ARE YOU NEXT TO AIRPORT OF SO IT HE'S AT AND NAY. YET LET AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OF RISK FACTORS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WEEK WITH EXPLORING MORE HOPING TO ACT BE DOING A FORMAL OF ONLY PROCESS THE FALL OF MANY MANY OF US HAVE BEEN IN THE WITH REGULAR STILL THEY USUALLY TAKES TWO THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THEN THE REGULATION. KIND OF TRY IN ADDITION WE ARE. IN THE- WE DID IT UP IN THE OF TWO NINETY THE STAND OF CARE GUIDELINES FOR PROVIDER. WE ACTUALLY POSTED ON A WEB AND AUGUST. THAT ALSO WAS PUBLIC ON. ON THE MEDICAL OR NEWS THAT THE MOM. AND ONE DO OUR ACTIVITIES OF WITH PROVIDERS WE HAD ALSO HE'S GIVE THEM THE AIM FOR. JUST SO THEY CAN STAY ON TO IN UNDER. WHAT THEY NEED TO AS A PERTAINS TEST. I'M JUST TO HELP IN OF LOW POISONING IN AND HE REMINDED AND ABOUT THEM TO. RETEST THESE KIDS. THANKS FOR THE TESTIMONY- LET ME JUST. FIRST TASK JUST VERY POINTEDLY- SHOULD WE ACTUALLY QUESTIONS ARISE FROM THE LAST PANEL BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF US WERE DISAPPOINTED AND DISMAYED WHEN WE LEARNED THAT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN. I HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED SO IF I CAN ASK JUST VERY DIRECTLY WHY DIDN'T THIS OCCUR- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND THEN SECONDLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH YOU KNOW THE STATE AUDITOR PROVIDED US ALL INFORMATION WITH. THE DATABASE TO FIND ALL THE HOT SPOT WHY WAS THIS NOT PROVIDED WHY WAS THIS NOT DONE BY CITY PH THESE ARE QUESTIONS KERRY FROM PREVIOUS PANEL. PLEASE I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT ANSWER BUT I THINK THERE'S REALLY THREE DIFFERENT PARTS TO IT. AND IT'S ABOUT ALIGNING BETWEEN ALL THE PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. SO ONE IS YOU'VE GOT TO GET INDIVIDUALS AND WE'VE GOT TO GET CHILDREN IN FORTHEIR FOR THEIR WELL JOHN PREVENTIVE VISITS AND THEN. MY CONCERN IS. IN ONE SEE EVEN IF THEY COME IN FOR THOSE PREVENTIVE VISITS DO THEY DO THE LEAD. SO YOU TO PUT. THEY DON'T COME IN WHEN THEY COME IN IF YOU DON'T DO THE TEST SO THEY'LL BE ONE PIECE. AND I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS RELATED TO THAT. IS NO MORE A VERY GOOD AT THE CLOSE WE PAY FOR. THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. IN THEORY SHOULD BE DONE. I ALSO THINK THAT MONEY MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND SO I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT INCENTIVES. FOR PROVIDERS HAVING FOCUSED INCENTIVES THAT MAKE THEM THINK ABOUT A PARTICULAR THING LIKE SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS LEAD TESTING FOR CHILDREN. I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ATTENTION. AND WE'VE SEEN HALTH PLANS DO THAT. IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS BAD AND HELPFUL SO THAT'S ONE. THING I'M HEALTH PLAN WELL. I THINK IT'S BEEN MOSTLY A DATA PROBLEM IT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT CLOUT IT'S GOING UP TO SEE PHD. YOU'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION COMING BACK THE PLANS BUT NOT THIS IS THE TEST RESULTS THEMSELVES THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IN YOUR PRACTICE pYOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT AWAY FOR THE PLAN TO HELP YOU SAY. HERE'S WHERE THE KIDS ARE COMING FROM WHERE YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT RISK AND TO YOU KNOW HOW YOU DOING OVERALL IN TERMS YOUR TEST. SO THERE'S REALLY A DEBT PROBLEM AND I THINK OF THE DEPARTMENT LOCAL- NO SPEAKING NOT FOR THE APARTMENT TIME BECAUSE OF THE JOB FOR TWO WEEKS AND ONE DAY. YOU KNOW THAT THAT FOCUS THAT. ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO THE PLANTS INTO THE PROVIDERS HAS NOT BEEN AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD BE BOTH FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE. THE INFORMATION. AND I'M A BELIEVER IN INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES I'M A BELIEVER IN THEM. SO I THINK THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW AS WE PRESENT TO. GET THE DATA GET IT BY MANAGED CARE AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FROM A FROM A PENALTY OF YOU AT THAT LEVEL. PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES THE PHYSICIANS. TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND DOING THIS EVERY THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IT UP WHEN YOU CLOSE TO ONE YEAR CLOSE. YOUR VOTE. TO ME THOSE ARE THE IS THAT WEREN'T THERE. AND SO. YOU KNOW. CAN I SAY WHY NOT- BUT I CAN SAY THAT I THINK THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO NOT TRY TO DO THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO DO WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE OKAY BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY DIRECT RESPONSE BUT- I WOULD ASK. YOU HAVE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INCENTIVES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PENALTIES. WHEN YOU CONTRACT OUT WITH MANAGE HEALTHCARE PLANS DON'T YOU HAVE THEY ARE MAKING SURE THAT THESE TESTS ARE DONE. YES THERE'S TWO PIECES IN ONE IS WE'VE NOT DONE THE MEASUREMENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT BEEN. THAT PARTICULAR MEASURE THE HE JUST MEASURE AND THEN THE SPECIAL MEASURE WE'RE GONNA DO TO HAVE ONE YEAR OLDS. HAVE NOT HAVE NOT BEEN THAT'S NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED- THERE'S BEEN MANY OTHER MEASURES AS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN AN ACCOUNTABILITY AT. ABOUT A CERTAIN SET A MEASURE. UP APARTMENT IS NOW GROSSLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THOSE THOSE- TO THOSE STUDY. BE DONE- AND THEY RAISE THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL TO A- WAS. THAT IT. YOU YOU KNOW MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THAT DATA FROM THE HEALTH PLANS SO WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND I DON'T KNOW J. C. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AIMED AT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF. CHILDREN BEING TESTED SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXACTLY HELP THESE FOLKS. ESPECIALLY IN THE- THE HOT SPOT AREAS AND WE ASKED BERMAN PUBLIC HEALTH ON. THE DATA BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS BROUGHT UP TO AS A- AS AN ISSUE. PLEASE YEAH AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ARE. YOU KNOW OUR KEY STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW IS. OUR OUR DATE. CONTINUOUS MAN SO I THINK THE AUDITOR'S MENTIONED THAT ABOUT 10% OF OUR- DATA STILL HAS TO BE MANUALLY PROCESSED IN ADDITION. WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF CLEANING WE HAVE TO THEN GO BACK. TO MATCHING IN. PART OF. THE INITIAL STEP FOR US WE READ WANT TO. MAKE SURE WE HELLO THE DATA THE- WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO CLEAN. THEN READY TO REPORT. WE ASK. HAD A FIRST DRAFT OF THE REPORT- IN THE SUMMER AND WE REALIZE LATER THAT. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MOST RECENT WHAT WE DO WE DO. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS AND SO PEOPLE WHEN WE SHOWED THIS AND IF WE GET THE DATA THAT WAS FOUR YEARS OLD YOU WERE GOING TO SAY WE- HAPPENED. THE MOST RECENT DATA WHAT WE DID RIGHT NOW IS. THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. UPDATING THE RIVER TO INCLUDE DATE FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND SO WE'VE- IT'S ALL IT'S TAKING TIME. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY INC WILL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH CO NINETY IT'S JUST ELAINE A LOT OF VERY AS THOUSANDS OF REPORTS IN THE DEPARTMENT TO KILL. AND I THINK FROM. IT PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE WE'VE MANDATED SOME OF THESE THINGS OF THE STATE OR TO BE COLLECTED SO JUST WONDERING WHY I'M ABLE TO GO ON LIKE A WEBSITE AND SEE PER DISTRICT OR PER COUNTY YOUR CODE HOW TO JUST I'M OF THE STATUS OF HARDWOOD. IS IT. LOOKING PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. ARE YOU ON THAT PATH WHERE YOU DON'T YEAH. ABSOLUTELY WE ARE OUR OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS PUBLISHED BY THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY WILL YOU'LL YOU WILL HAVE. THE ZIP CODE DATA LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW ZIP CODES WITH HIGH RISKS YOU WILL ALSO SEE. MY COUNTY THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE HAVE- ELEVATED BLOOD LEVELS SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THAT YOU CAN. TO OUR WEBSITE NOW IN CHECK. THAT HAVE INTO YOU KNOW IT'S FOR I. WE'RE JUST REALLY FINAL SOME OF THE LAST MINUTE DETAILS TO THE REPORT GOT IT. RIGHT AND HAVING THAT DATA IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO. FIGURE OUT WHERE WE NEED. IT IS HOT SPOT FOR THE ACTUAL TESTING WHICH- WAS CENTER WE ARE WITHOUT A- NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS WE'LL START WITH SENATOR MITCHELL PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT I'LL STICK TO JUST ONE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT MULTIPLE COMMITTEES HERE SO I WILL. ASK ONE. I'M IT TODAY AND I. SHE IN PERSPECTIVE THAT AS WE ADD TO THE YOU KNOW YOUR WILL CHILD VISITS YOU KNOW WE ONLY PAY FOR. TWENTY THIRTY MINUTES A SELF DID MANAGE CARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO EXTEND IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. I HOWEVER I MUST SAY WE KNOW THAT THE LONG TERM IMPACT- OF EXPOSURE TO LET IS YOU KNOW HUGELY DETRIMENTAL AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE CHILDREN WHO ARE MOST LIKELY EXPOSE WERE POOR KIDS WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN. WHO ARE- READY COMPROMISED SECONDS. AND FOR WHAT IT'S IT IT IT IT HEIGHTENS OUR- TO MAKE SURE THE DO THIS. THE WE DO WELL. I AM LOOKING AT THE AUDITOR'S FULL REPORT ON PAGE THIRTY SIX OUT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY LIST A NUMBER OF MISSED DEADLINES ON A RELATION TO. CURRENT LAW CURRENT CODE SECTION. I WANT TO AS AS A FOLLOW UP TO MY- QUESTION TO THE FIRST PANEL. LOOK AT THE- FOR LEGAL. WHICH IS THE FOR YOU TO PROMULGATE RAGS TO INCLUDE- A NEW DETERMINATION OF RISK FACTORS FOR WHETHER CHILD IS AT RISK AND I GO BACK TO THE CHART THAT'S ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT- AND WILD. PROMULGATING RIGS YOU KNOW. CAN BE. AN ARDUOUS TASK I GET THERE. IT'S NOT IS ROCKET SCIENCE LET'S JUST BE HONEST AND SO CAN YOU GIVE US A NEW DATE BY WHICH WE CAN REALISTICALLY EXPECT THAT YOU WILL HAVE COMPLETED THESE RAGS SO WE KNOW THAT IT WHETHER IT'S THIS LIST WHETHER BASED ON YOUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WILL BE DIFFERENT. ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT WHY I'M ASKING WE ARE AS A LEGISLATURE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HOUSING- AND WE ARE HAVING MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHERE AND HOW QUICKLY WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE IN LOCUM. LOW INCOME HOUSING AND I DON'T WANT US TO POSITION WHERE WE ARE NOT YOU KNOW. SAYS SITTING. LOCATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN TO LIVE AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT LITTLE DIAGRAM THAT I FOR THIS MY DISTRICT IN JEFFERSON PARK WHERE UP. BUILDINGS ARE SHEER PROPERTY LINE WITH WITH WITH WITH- OIL COMPANIES- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACCURATE PERMITTING WHERE. YEAH AND CAN IN A POSITION WHERE WE'VE DEALT WITH LEAD PAINT BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND ARE NOT TECHNOLOGY ALL THESE NEW RELEVANT MORE TIMELY RISK FACTORS THAT ARE EXPOSING CHILDREN TO LET WITHOUT QUESTION. SO WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THOSE REGULATIONS TO BE DONE. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY FEVERISHLY TO GET THESE DONE LAST YEAR WE SPENT PRACTICALLY ALL OF YOUR CONVENIENCE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND LET ME JUST KIND OF REMIND FOLKS. THIS ALTHOUGH IT- A PROCESSES THE PRICE IS NOT IN ITSELF IS NOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS THAT WE HAVE TO CONVENE THE STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE SCIENCE BEHIND THIS WE CALL OTHER STATES WANTED TO DO WHAT DID YOU LEARN WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENT OR BETTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL THAT IN ITSELF HAS TAKEN ALL OF THESE MINES- HE WE- WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE DRAFT IT SOME OF THE REGULATIONS BASED ON. THEIR FEEDBACK AND I NOW WE'RE HOPING TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TO TWENTY. UP FOR OPEN COMMENT TO WITH A FINALIZED STRIKES FIGHT SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S THE WAY FOR US ON. WORST CASE SCENARIO IN THAT IT HAPPENED WHAT'S- THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY AND I GET THE- PROCESS IN THE END AND IT AND IT TAKES STUFF FOR REASONS WE WANT TO HAVE STAY COLD ENGAGE. KNOW WHAT DATE THE COLD WIND SO LONG THIS ALSO A REALLY ABOUT PLANNING ON YOUR PART IN TERMS OF FACTORING IN ALL OF THOSE STEPS THAT'S THAT'S A- CUSTOMER PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WHEN YOU PROBABLY GET ROEG'S ALL THE TIME SO SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SHE THANKS. A MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN THE GIRL. I THANK YOU TO PAY BACK ON I. THE BILL WAS PASSED IN IS AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN DOCTOR QUIRK AND MYSELF IT SAYING THAT THESE REGULATIONS HAD TO BE DONE BY MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE'VE MISSED THAT THAT LINE WE HAVEN'T HAD A STAKEHOLDER MEETING SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S BEEN AT LEAST POSTED. AND SO YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AND I JUST HEARD CONFLICTING DAY TO JUST TOLD MISS MITCHELL THE WHOLE BY TWENTY TWENTY. HOW A LIST YOU JUST GONNA LEADING PROCESS IN THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT SIX TWO THREE YEARS AND SO DOES NUMBER SOMETHING TO MATCH UP TO ME SO THAT I MISSED SOMETHING THERE ON THAT CAN IN AND FOR ME. SO I HOLDERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE WE DRAFTED- SOME OF EXAMPLE REGULATIONS WORKING WITH OUR LEGAL TEAM ILL GO THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS FREIGHT IT GOES THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT HEAD AGENCY- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS WERE HOPING TO BE IN UP THEY CALL LATE THE FORTY FIVE DAY WERE FOLKS CAN COMMENT ON WILL WE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH SO WE'RE DOING TWO SETS OF. IT IN FROM STAKEHOLDER DOESN'T HELP. I DON'T KNOW THAT HOW CLOSELY BUT I WILL SAY THIS MY FIRST QUESTION IS WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO SO THAT- PROVIDERS WERE WORKING BETTER WITH A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO SAID THERE'S INFORMATION TO. THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT GETTING TESTED I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IN THIS DEPARTMENT. IS A CULTURAL ISSUE OF TREATIES COMMITTEES ARE VULNERABLE IS COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FATE THAT EVEN THESE KIDS ARE GOING TO BE AT WHAT WE IN LAW THAT YOU ASKED TO THIS IS AN ARTIST. IN ALL THOSE THAT LIE. ON AN AND FOR ME IT'S WHAT ARE WE DOING JUST WE HAVE IS THAT. TIME BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE THIRTY SECONDS TO BE PUT I HAVE SEVEN THAT CONTINUE. HELLO I KEEP AN EYE ON. PRETTY REYES WHEN I. PEOPLE COME COMMUNITIES THAT LOOK LIKE MINE AND SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AT THIS DEPARTMENTS THAT WE PRIOR PURCHASES WANT TO LOOK COMMUNITIES I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET. QUESTION I KNOW THAT THIS IS- VERY IMPORTANT FOR DIRECTOR AND OUR AGENCY AND I ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR PROGRAM- YOU KNOW LIKE THAT I'M A MOTHER- I LET THE NOW AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND- THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ADDRESS SEEING AT THE MOST HONORABLE ZIP CODS THE COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE AT IT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF YOU KNOW. FOR A LOT. EACH MANAGEMENT IN OUR- BRANCH AND IN OUR CENTER TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME AND REALLY TRANSFORM AND BE MORE INNOVATIVE ON THE WAY THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY I ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS NOT JUST SHOW THEM WHEN WE DRAFTED SOMETHING BASED ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BUT- GET THE STAKEHOLDERS PERSPECTIVE WE HEARD A LOT FROM PROVIDERS ON. HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE THIS WAS REALLY CAN IT TAKE MORE TIME THAN THE FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THEY HAVE AND THAT THEY NEEDED. US TO BE CONSCIOUS OF ENSURING THAT IT WAS IT A SMOOTH PROCESS THAT THEY CAN JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH AND CHECK UP SO. WE NEED IN ORDER FOR THESE TO WORK IN IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TAKE LONGER. TO GET OUT FOR OPEN COMMENT REDUCE THE BACK FOR- INITIALLY. BACK TO PLAIN I MEAN I STILL UNDERSTAND WHY WE DIDN'T DO THIS WHEN THE BILL. WAS MOVING WHEN THE BILL WAS SIGNED- THERE WAS AN AUDIT AND YOU SURPLUS COMING INTO THIS. LACK OF PLANNING- IN THERE YOU HAVE PROVIDED SOME. DATA I UNDERSTAND YOU DATA IS YOUR SYSTEM AS OLDER YOU'RE TRYING TO. UPDATE IT AND SO IT'S HARD TO SPLIT UP WITH THE AUDITOR WAS STILL ABLE TO USE YOUR ANTIQUATED SYSTEM AND THE WAY YOUR DATA IS COLLECTED TO COME UP WITH THE PORTS FOR US. BASED ON DISTRICTS BASED ON. THIS TRACK YOU HAVE NOW YOURSELF PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION. ON YOUR WEBSITE AND WE HAVE TO THAT HERE. IT DOESN'T BREAK IT DOWN BY SIP CODE YET. ONE IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR. YOU IDENTIFY COMMUTE MY LOOK AT THE ALLEY. FOR EXAMPLE I MIGHT MISS OUT LIKE THAT THERE'S THE CENSUS TRACK WHERE IT'S- IN PLACE AND SINCE LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY WHEN ARE WE GONNA SEE THAT TYPE OF MORE GREATER DATA. AVAILABLE SO THE REPORT WILL HIGHLIGHT- SIT CODE SO WE CONSIDERED- AT RISK FOR. FOR EXAMPLE AS WE MENTIONED THE NEXT TO FREEWAYS BE NEXT TO ROADS. THAT READ. WILL BE. IN THE SPRING ON INDUSTRY OF TWENTY. TO BE. COOL SO I GUESS THE COULD CREATE AN A FOR THAT VERSUS THE BY PHONE SEE AHA. OR THEY CHILL TO. MAKE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO ONE MY CHECK MY I STILL GO CHECK IT OUT. ON IN THAT AVAILABLE THEN FROM AVAILABLE NOT. MISSION WAS AVAILABLE THAT WHY THAT NOT A BILL AT THAT LEVEL ON THE WEBSITE FIRST YOU. TO LOOK AT AND HOW OFTEN WITH THE STATE BE UPDATED. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN UPDATE. THIS YEAR AND NOT ONE FOR FOUR YEARS ARE GONNA BE SEEING QUARTERLY UPDATES- AND SO I GUESS. MY QUESTION IS THIS DATA TO A PIECE US OR OR DO WE REALLY HAVE A PROCESS THAT WOULD THINKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS DATA GOING TO BE USEFUL FOR COMMUNITIES. FOR PROVIDERS FOR LEGISLATORS AND HOUSING TO UPDATE IT REGULARLY. SO OUR GOAL IS TO ACTUALLY AND WHAT IT TAKES THAT LONG. OUR GOAL IS TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THIS REPORT. ANNUALLY THE AND IT'S PART OF ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND ONE OF THE STATUTES- BID IN ADDITION TO THAT. WORRY WE HOPE THAT AS A SYSTEMS. AND THE NEW SYSTEM SHIELD IS IN PLACE THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS A LOT FASTER- BUT AGAIN. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. WELL YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IN THE REPORT TO IS. YOU'LL SEE THAT ARE NOW IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO WE'LL HAVE THE DATE OF. OUR OWN. TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN AND- EIGHTEEN YOU'LL HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE BY THE NO. OF CASES. LET BY. T. C. BAD YOU'LL SEE SAID. WE CONSIER HI RISK SO THAT REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY. MY LAST QUESTION ON THIS THIS NEW SHIELD A PROGRAM THAT YOU ARE. WORKING TO IMPLEMENT WE GAVE YOU MONEY AND THE BUDGET LAST YEAR WORRY OUT WITH THAT AND HOW QUICKLY SECOND AB DONE. OKAY SO- WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE HELP PROCESS AND SORRY I'M NOT AN 80% BUT WHAT I UNDERSTAND I KNOW THAT WERE ON STAGE FOUR THERE'S FOUR STAGES WERE ENTERING THE AST STAGE WITH THAT- IN TERMS OF THE PRESS. SINCE IT'S GONNA TAKE ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO FINISH- SHIELDS TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE NEW DATA SYSTEM. AND SAYS WE ARE. WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING PLACED AND NOW WE HAVE A NEED NOW- I HOPE. I'M NOT GONNA ASK THE QUESTION TODAY FIVE AM I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA GET THE ANSWER BY HOPE QUICKLY FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA CONSOLIDATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AN OLDER SYSTEM AB WORKING WITH FREDDY'S FOUR MORE YEARS AN EXPECTATION THAT WE HAVE THAT WE GET. NEED A RAID EARLY IN ITS UPDATED. ON AND IT'S ACCURATE AS YOU DOING THIS OTHER WORK AT THE SAME TIME YOUR MULTI TASKING. AND WHILE ON A MISSION WE HAVE PROCESS THAT'S SMART BASED ON SCIENCE TALKING TO STAY HOME. THIS PRIORITIZE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE WAITING FOR ANOTHERFOUR YEARS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. THERE IS A LOT LET'S BE NONE OTHER. THIS IS. FINDING SOME OF THE SAME. OR DO. I KNOW WE CAN ADOPT. TEMPORARY EXPENSE. OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE TESTING FOR- UP AND THAT THAT COULD BE AUGMENTED LATER I JUST DELETED BUT WE KNOW ENOUGH NOW THAT. I WOULD GET AT THEM TO THIS LIST NINE WITH EVEN IF IT'S NOT A COMPLETE LIST. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK YOU'RE JUST LIKE HEARING THE FRUSTRATION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ALL REPRESENT A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING NOW AND- YOU KNOW. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN WE SEE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE WE WANT TO SEE THAT DATE ALSO AVAILABLE. LIKE WEBSITE AS WELL SO THAT WE START PRIORITIZING ESPECIALLY AS WE'VE BEEN ALLOCATING MONEY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. TO START SEEING THOSE RESULTS AND HELPING THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING THE MOST- SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING. TODAY FROM- MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE NOW WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO SENATOR LIFE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I DATA IS GOOD RESULTS ARE BETTER LET ME CHECK. WITH THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MADAM AUDITOR AND HER TEAM UP FOR ANOTHER THOROUGH AUDIT. VERY EYE OPENING VERY ENLIGHTENING. SO WE KNOW IT IS A FACT THAT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN LET HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGE AND- BIRTH DEFECTS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE KNOW THAT LED CAUSES CANCER. AND IN THE LITTLE EXAMPLE HERE OF BLOOD LEVELS WHICH IS VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO'S NOT A DOCTOR TO READ. THE VERY LOWEST LEAD IN EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN IN THEIR BLOOD CAUSES DAMAGE HEARING. BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS AND JUST DECREASED IQ LEVEL SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE TO ME THAT WE ARE SITTING HERE TODAY IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN TEST CHILL AND- YEAH WE- BEEN ARM VULNERABLE COMMUTE. I APPRECIATE ALLOF YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU TO THIS VERY SERIOUSLY BUCKLEY SOMEONE WAS TAKING A VERY SERIOUSLY FOR ALMOSTA DECADE- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUDITOR'S KEY FINDINGS. DH DS DID NOT INSURE OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE SEE ALL THE LEAD TEST THAT THEY SHOULD. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAD- HAD LEAD POISONING AND REQUIRE TREATMENT WHY HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN OVER ALMOST A DECADE. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR NEW DOCTOR HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. THERE WAS A FAILURE ON MANY LEVELS AND I THINK THE FAILURE WAS A COMBINATION LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE OF. NOT HAVING WORDING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SAY THIS PLANS DOING OKAY ABOUT PLANS NOT DOING OKAY THIS DOCTORS NOT DOING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD PURSES THIS DOCTOR BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AS YOU KNOW WHERE THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE NOT UNIVERSE I MEAN THERE ARE POSITIONS THAT ARE VERY ORGANIZED TEARS UP TO DO THE WELL CHILD THEY REALLY HARD IT'S ABOUT THE DO THE TESTING. AND THERE'S OTHER PHYSICIANS NOT AS MUCH BUT IF YOU HAVE THE DATA WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS IT MAKES IT HARD CHECKS IN TEXAN MAKE SURE THAT THE DATE THERE FIND IT AT. WAIT ANOTHER DESK. I'M NOT IT'S I THINK IT'S TO ONE IS THE DATE IS FRAGMENT SO THE TEST RESULTS GO TO CITY PH THE ACTUAL LEVELS THE PLAN GET SOME RESULTS THE TEST HAS BEEN DONE BUT REALLY YOU NEED THE LEVELS SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY IS WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT ALL COMES TOGETHER NOT ONLY COULD GATHER BUT HAS A FIRE THE FACT THAT THERE SEVEN THOUSAND. AS THE DOOR OF DEAD OF THEM SEE AN ATTACHED THAT TO A CHILD MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO THEN SAY ALL RIGHT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT CHART WHERE WAS THE CHILD WHO IS THE POSITION AND WHAT HEALTH CLUB WITH A- IF YOU. ARE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LAB REPORTING WITHOUT A IDENTIFY. WE ARE US. SO I THINK IT'S THAT. OF GETTING THE DATA IT'S ALSO. YOU KNOW HAVING THE REPORTING UP TO THE STATE TO THE STAKE IN ALL THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. SO THE FAILURE ON MANY LEVELS. SO IF THE AUDIT HAD NOT BEEN DONE DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGER QUESTION FIGURE CLOCK ARE WE MONITORING OURSELVES AND ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS. SO AT THIS CHEESY COOPER- I THINK THAT- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RECENT CONVERSATIONS IN LIGHT OF BOTH THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES AUDIT AS WELL AS THE BLOOD THAT SCREENING IN REGARDS TO THE DEPARTMENT TAKING A STEP BACK AND THINKING ABOUT HOW ARE WE MONITORING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. ON WHO THEN WE HOLD RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITOR OUR PROVIDERS TO DO WHATEVER IS IN OUR CONTRACT AS DOCTOR GILBERT WAS MENTORING THERE'S MANY LAYERS OF HOW WE APPROACH THIS AS WELL AS ARMING BENEFICIARIES- AND FAMILIES WITH THEIR RIGHTS. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO AND SO I THINK PARTY WILL BE I'M STEPPING BACK AND THINKING STRONGLY ABOUT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE HAVE BETTER SUCCESS HOW DO WE NOT MIX- SOMETHING. WE COULD HAVE INFORMATION- OR DATA OR AND SO I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO VERY STRONG THINKING IN THIS AREA- PARTNER WITH OUR CARE PLANS A PROVIDER OUT WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH HOW ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GET ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT. I AM. AN THE IS NOT A GREAT. BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS WE DID NOT KNOW HOW BAD THIS WAS THE DO NOT HAVE AN ELEVEN THINK WE KNEW ABOUT THIS WAS BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW GIVEN THEM THE LEAD EXPOSURE AND WHAT IT DOES TO CHILDREN. AND BY WE I'M I'M TALKING BOTH YOU KNOW IT EVERY LEVEL- AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER BUT IT'S AN HONEST ANSWER AND I CAN APPRECIATE THAT. SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO CHILDREN THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES FOR BOTH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THESE TESTS ARE BEING DONE. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO TREAT THESE CHILDREN BUT SHOULD WE DO A BETTER JOB OF PREVENTION. I THINK IT GOES A LITTLE BIT TO MS MITCHELL'S POINT ABOUT US INDIVIDUALS POINT ABOUT WHERE WE BUILD HOUSES AND WHATNOT SO THAT IS ALL OF US. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE TO IN A TIME IN AN AREA WHERE WE ARE AND WE ARE PREVENTING IT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CHILDREN BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD. AND DOCTOR PAN I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS ABOUT HOW LONG DO WE MAKE THE FORM- I AM A NEW GRANDMA AND I'VE BEEN TO THE PEDIATRICIANS OFFICE WITH MY DOG- FILLS. ARM AND I GET TO LOOK AT HER AND WHAT SHE DOINGTHAT. BUT IT'S A TWO PAGE FOR AND I MEAN IF WE- ASK YOUR TO WATCH. I WE CAN PUT ON THAT FORM YOU KNOW THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR CHILD IS EXPOSED TO LEAD. SO YOU THINK COULD MAKE TAKE ALONG. I THINK YOU TAKE OUT MY LONGER I ALSO WONDERFUL. ABOUT THOUGHT ABOUT DOORS. JUST IN FOR. TO OUR SCHOOL. THAT THAT'S HOW WE USED TO GET. PERMISSION I WAS A CHILD TELL ME. GOT PERMISSION. IN MAKE SURE PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS WHEN THEY TAKE THEIR CHILD MAKE SURE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE THIS IS A GREAT PLACE O KNOW WHERE THEIR RIGHTS ARE SO I AM FRUSTRATED BECAUSE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I HAVE HAD THREE BILL SIGNED INTO LAW THE DEAL WITH LEAD. POISONING IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN OUR SCHOOLS WHY I AM PART OF THE GROUP THAT HAS ANOTHER BILL THIS YEAR- YOU KNOW WE IT'S TOO BAD THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS SO I THINK WE'LL KEEP DOING IT FOR AS LONG AS WE NEED TO BUT I ASK YOU TO PLEASE TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY IT SHOULD BE TAKEN THERE'S NO SAFE EXPOSURE TO LET WE ARE HARMING OUR CHILDREN AND DOWN DOWNSTREAM IT'S GOING TO COST US EVEN MORE TO DO THE REMEDIATION SO I APPRECIATE YOUR HONEST ANSWERS NOW WE JUST REALLY NEED TO DO YOUR JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER LEVEL WITHOUT LIVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEN TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH COUPLE. HAVE BEEN IN. BUT OF ONE FUNDAMENTAL IS- THE AUDITOR WAS ABLE TO TAKE DATA. AND PUT IT TOGETHER FOR US TO SHOW THE HOT SPOTS- IN. ARE YOU WHY CAN'T YOU DO THE SAME KIND OF THING IN THE INTERIM BEFORE WAITING FOR THIS SHIELD COME ON LINE WHICH YOU SAID MIGHT TAKE FOUR YEARS. ARE WE NOT GONNA HAVE DATA ON OUR WEBSITE FOR FOUR YEARS. AND WHY WHY IS IT SO DIFFERENT WHY WHY WHY COULD THEY DO IT. AND YOU GUYS COULDN'T DO IT. SO YOU WILL HAVE A DATA OF THE BY IN A REPORT AS I MENTIONED WILL. HIGHLIGHT THE- COUNTY. WITH A NUMBER FOR THE WEBSITE. THE WEBSITE BUT THEN THERE'S A FULL REPORT. DUE IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR CORRECT AND THAT'S GONNA BE WHEN WE'RE GONNA GET THAT THIS SPRING OF THIS YEAR SO A FULL WITH THIS WE'RE IN THIS WORLD WHERE INSPIRON MOST IN SPRING. SO IT'S A FOUR YEAR LATE AND THEN THE NEXT BI ANNUAL REPORT WILL BE TWO NEXT YEAR OR WILL IT BE PUSHED OFF A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT. NO HOPEFULLY BE DONE BY NEXT YEAR YEAH SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CURRENT RASCAL SYSTEM IS ANTIQUATED WE ARE STILL CLEANING DATA MINING DATA. TO GET THE REPORTS PRODUCED. OKAY WE HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS GOING ON- AND WHY SOME OF THE DATA WASN'T BEING COLLECTED WAS BECAUSE THE- THERE WASN'T A DEPARTMENT HEAD OR SOMETHING DO YOU HAVE THE STAFF IN PLACE NOW. TO DO TO SUPERVISE ALL OF THIS YES SO AS OF APRIL OF LAST YEAR WE HIRED A NEW BRANCH CHIEF- IN AS I MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE- PRIOR TO HER EATING COMING ON BOARD WE STARTED THE WHOLE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT THE DATA TRYING TO CLEAN THE DATA TRYING TO MAKE IT. UP TO DATE AND THE TIME WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUDITOR THEY WERE ABLE TO GET SENIOR DATA THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO. GO THROUGH AND ARE NOT ONLY IS A NEW DAY EVEN PLACE BUT WERE ALSO IS- GOING THROUGH A LOT OF THE- YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT CHANGES IN A- BRANCH. OR STAKEHOLDERS WERE CLOSER WITH A LOCAL HEALTH- CLICK PROGRAMS TRYING TO IT YOU KNOW PROVE ON EVALUATION. EXPECTATION IS THAT WE HAVE. THERE'S MORE THINGS THAT WERE DOING. OR ELLERY ACTIVITIES HAVE STOPPED WE CONTINUE TO FOR EXAMPLE REACH OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION FAMILIES ANNUALLY WORK. ARE WORTH- BIT WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO BETTER WITH THE REPORT IN OUR DATA IN ANOTHER AND I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ON AND OFF ON THE DOT ON. ANOTHER ONE- WAS IT IN AND SOME THE DOCUMENTS WE GOT TODAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS POINTED OUT THAT- FUNDING FOR- DATA COLLECTION ACTIVITIES OR OR THINGS IN COUNTIES. ISN'T ISN'T- ISN'T DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE IN ONE COUNTY YOU'VE GOT FORTY KIDS AND NEVER CAN YOU GOT EIGHTY KIDS WITH THE COUNTY DISCOVER FORTIES GETTING MORE MONEY. SO WHEN CAN WE EXPECT SOME REFORM IN IN HOW YOU'RE ALLOCATING RESOURCES I HAVE A COUNTY IT'S IT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT THAT- HUMBOLDT COUNTY THAT- IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT. WE GOT PARENTS WHO WHO WHO WHO DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO COOPERATE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT MEANS THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP AD EDUCATION AND SO ON TO TRY TO HELP. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THE REASONS THAT THAT THAT SOME OF THAT ACTIVITIES AND HAPPENINGS THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES LOCALLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO HOW DO WE GET THE FUNDING REFORM GOING AND HOW LONG COULD THAT TAPE BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY NOT EQUITABLE- AND THAT THAT'S JUST CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE PROBLEMS. SO WE SPEND SOME TIME IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO LOOKING AT OUR FUNDING FORMULA. WE UPDATED BASED ON THE LATEST DATA THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF- A LITTLE ELEVATED HE LEVELS BY COUNTY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT- A FUNDING MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO ELEVATE THE FUNDING- FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN AS YOU ARE AWARE OF. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE REPORT EXPLORE THE BUDGET PROCESS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS WE WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT. WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF NOW. BASED ON THE NEW NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE HOW WE WULD APPROACH IT IN TE TYPE OF ALLOCATIONS THAT WE WOULD MAKE. IT'S JUST NOW FINDING WHAT MECHANISM DO WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY OF MAN OR AUTHORITY FROM THE BUDGET TO DO SO. AND IT'S KIND OF A FINAL FINAL FINAL POINT HERE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE THIS IS NOW THE THIRD RECENT AUDIT THAT- HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF DCS AND THE DOCTOR GO OVER. WELCOME ABOARD AND I. AND THIS COOPER YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE THIS- WE'VE HAD ISSUES AND WITH RURAL EXPANSION SO YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S CRITICAL WIN WIN WIN BENEFICIARIES YOU'RE HAVING TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES SOMETIMES TO GET CARE- NOW WE HAVE THE WE HAD THE PREVENTIVE CARE- ISSUE- AND NOW THIS ONE AND I HEARD WHAT HURTS AS- WELL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO IN OF THE PLANS ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE. BUT BUT IN EVERYONE OF THOSE AUDITS DH CS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED FOR NOT. DOING THEIR THEIR JOB IN THAT. AND I JUST WONDER HOW MANY MORE OF THESE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE OUT THERE. AND THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN BECAUSE- WE'RE DOING WE'RE PASSING LAWS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS. AND YET OUR OWN DEPARTMENTS CAN'T SEEM TO MOVE ON ON THAT- IT'S SAID THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS COMING FROM- IN. IT HOW DO HOW HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MORE IS OUT THERE I HAVE TO WONDER QUITE FRANKLY- YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE TERM LIMITS BEING THE WAY THEY WERE. SOME OF US WERE ONLY HERE FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS AND SO. WAS PRETTY EASY TO IGNORE SOME OF THIS A LITTLE BIT- BUT GUESS WHAT WERE AROUND FOR LONGER. AND WE AND WE- AND PART OF OUR- ROLE AS LEGISLATORS IS OVERSIGHT. AND WHEN WE FIND THESE THINGS AND WE BRING THEM TO YOUR ATTENTION TO ATTENTION. WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE KIND OF HIT A WALL BECAUSE WE GET WILL WILL IMPROVE WILL IMPROVE. BUT AT. THE PACE SEEM SOMEWHAT GLACIAL. QUITE FRANKLY- AND- I YOU KNOW. CAN SOMEONE GIVE US HOPE THAT THINGS SPINACH. BUT HONESTLY BECAUSE- AND THEN I CAN I CAN GO BACK COME YEARS OVERSIGHT WITH- LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES- AND SOME AND DUPLICATION AND WASTE AND THINGS LIKE THAT- ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT HADN'T BEEN LOOKED OUT FOR A LONG TIME SO I. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OVER A RAINBOW OR SOMETHING BUT I CAN. DO YOU SEE YOUR DO YOU SEE OUR WHY WERE FRUSTRATED. THE START WELL. YES I MEAN I THINK THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY ARE FRUSTRATED JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I THINK ON THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO AN EXTENSIVE DEEP DIVE IN REGARDS TO HOW WE OVERSEE OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- ALL THE WAY FROM THE GUIDANCE THAT WE GIVE THE LANGUAGE IN OUR CONTRACT TO BE CLEAR THE LANGUAGE IN THE CONTRACT SOMETIMES IS SO BIG ORDERS TO BEG THAT IT IS HARDER FOR US TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO AN EXPECTATION AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY DOING A- FULL REWRITE. OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACT TO MAKE IT MORE SPECIFIC SO THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING A HUGE VARIATION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW SOMEONE INTERPRETED THE CONTRACTUAL YOU KNOW LANGUAGE IN OUR CONTRACT BECAUSE OF THE ELLIPTICAL IF THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE IS TIGHTER IT ALLOWS US TO THEN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO PUT THAT INTO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IT TO SANCTION THEM SO WE ARE STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING AT OUR CONTRACT BECAUSE THAT IS THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DOES WE HAVE DELEGATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE MANSION. PLANNED PERCY THAT INCENSED POINT FIVE MILLION LIVES AND THEN IF YOU FOR SERVICE OUTSIDE OF THAT AND SO ON THAT IS ONE PLACE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN REGARDS TO TIGHTENING UP OUR IT IS WITHIN THAT CONTRACT WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WE ARE- ALSO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN DO IMMEDIATE SUSPICIONS WITH AND-% CALIFORNIAAS A- PLANT COUNTY OF WE'RE ALSO STEPPING BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE DO CALL. DIFFERENTLY IN SOMETHING'S WRONG IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO% I'M IN LIGHT AUDITS- BUT I THINK OVERALL THINKING HOW CAN WE THINK OF QUALITY IN A DIFFERENT WAY I'M LOOKING AT BOTH PROCESS QUALITY OUTCOMES AND HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND THEN LASTLY I'M WE NEED TO pMANAGED CARE PLANS BECAUSE CLEARLY WE'VE BEEN AUDITING CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE WHO AUDITS MANAGED CARE PLANS EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN THIS NATION NO OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAM DOES THAT THEY DO EVERY THREE YEARS OR SO OFTEN BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR AUDITING PROCESS TO SEE WHAT ARE WE MISSING OR HOW ARE WE- CAPTURING THINGS THAT ARE SHOWING. IN THIS AUDIT ON THE PROCESS HE'S AS WELL IT SURE THAT WE. ARE OUR TAKING A FRESH LOOK THOSE ITEMS ON A- BASIS SO I THINK THERE'S A MULTI PRONGED. INTO IN REGARDS TO THAT THEN THE DOWNSTREAM TO WERE HOLDING MANAGED CARE PLANS RESPONSIBLE AND THEN THEY MANAGED VERY LARGE NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS- AND HOW ARE THEY- ON WHETHER IT'S- A PROVIDING INCENTIVES OR INFORMATION OR GUIDANCE TO THEIR PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. ON THEIR REQUIREMENTS AS A MEDICAID PROVIDER WHICH IS. SOMETIMES VERY DIFFERENT- THAN OTHER PLAYERS ON AS WE MENTIONED IN THIS HEARING TODAY. IT IS A MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS TO SCREEN FOR BLOOD THAT SCREENING AT AT TWO AND AT ONE. BUT IS NOT AND IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL OTHER PLAYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND BY COMING A MEDICAID PROVIDER MEDI CAL PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND SO. IF YOU'RE SEEING ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF MEDICAID OR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SOMETIMES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND- THOSE THOSE DIFFERENCES. AND THE EXPECTATION WE HAVE IN OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM. THEY'RE SEEING A VERY LARGE PORTION OF MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES- SOMETIMES THEY HAVE AS DOCTOR GILBERT MENTIONED EARLIER. VERY TIGHT PROCESS SEES IN REGARDS TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE MEDICAID OR MEDICARE PROGRAM. SO A LOT OF. THESE THE LAST PORTION AND DEFINITELY THE LEASES HOW DO WE MAY SURE BENEFITS. ARE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND PERFECT- PROTECTIONS IN THIS PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR TODAY THERE EPS YOU T. BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND I THINK WE ARE THINKING THROUGH A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO THAT. ARE BOTH OUR FAMILIES BENEFICIARIES WITH- INFORMATION AS WELL. WE DOCTOR WOULD I SAY TO MY I SAY TO THE HEALTH PLANS THE GOOD NEWS IS. I KNOW WHAT HEALTH PLANS CAN DO AND HOW THEY OPERATE. THE BAD NEWS FOR YOU IS A HEALTH PLAN IS I KNOW HOW HEALTH PLANS OPERATE. AND WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF AND SO. I BRING A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO AUDIT. IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT I HAVE TO SAY. THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY RAISE THE BAR AROUND QUALITY AND THEY DID IT LAST YEAR AND IT WAS. YOU KNOW THERE'S THE- RESULTS DRIVE CHANGE THEY DO- BY RAISING THE MPL THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE THAT IS A BIG DEAL IN TERMS OF CREATING THAT STANDARD BECAUSE THAT'S A NATIONWIDE STANDARD. AND FIFTY OF APPEAL MEANS HAVE PLANS ARE BELOW IT. AND HELP PLANS ARE ABOVE IT AND THEN REALLY LOOKING AT. AND THEY INCREASE THE NUMBER MEASURES THAT ARE OUT THERE SO. I FEEL LIKE SOME POSITIVE CHANGES HAVE BEEN STARTED TO BE MADE FOR SURE. AND I THINK- JC IS A BIG PART OF THAT- BUT I DO BRING SOME SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE THAT I THINK WILL HELP IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE SAME MOVED ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAY AS AND SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CONSIDER. PLEASE DISTRICTS. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE THREE YEARS. AND IN THESE THREE YEARS I'VE HAD THE INTERACTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S ALMOST THE FLIP IN ITS KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT IT ISN'T UNTIL. SOMETHING IS DEMANDED DIDN'T EVEN I LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES WERE ALMOST PLEADING WON'T YOU PLEASE DO YOUR JOB. YOU MAY BE-NEW DOCTOR GILBERT BUT THE REST OF THE TEAM IS NOT. AND YOU'RE COMING INTO A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY FAILED OUR CHILDREN. OUR CHILDREN. WITH ONLY 27% GETTING ALL OF THE TESTING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET. THE THIS IS CRIMINAL WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE CHILDREN AND THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE OF THE CHILDREN. AND THAT IS WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST WHEN WE-HAD OUR MEETING WITH THE AUDITOR AND WITH THOSE WOULD WORK ON THIS. QUESTION WE ASKED IS HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GO THROUGH THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT UP ON THE WEBSITE. SEVENTY TWO HOURS WASN'T THAT IT SEVENTY TWO HOURS THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND WERE ABLE TO PUT IT UP ON BY BY CENSUS. THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE ON YOUR STAFF AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BUSINESS THAT THEY ARE HIRED TO DO IS OF GREAT GREAT CONCERN TO ME. GREAT CONCERN TO ME BECAUSE IN THE END WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO ANGRY BUT I AM JUST. BEYOND FRUSTRATED. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS ONLY FOR ME BUT I REMEMBER WHEN MY DEAR SENATOR HAD INTRODUCED BILLS BILLS I REMEMBER. WHEN I WOULD INTRODUCED I WOULD TALK ABOUT THESE BILLS ACHIEVING PRODUCED THEY WERE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN I'D COME IN AND I'M STILL DOING THE SAME TING. AND TO BE. DURING ONE OF THE HEARINGS TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT. TELL US. I'M SORRY LIED TO US ABOUT THE THESE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE THE REPORTING THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND THEY WERE ABSOLUTE FALSE FALSEHOODS. AND IT IS A MARK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASKED THE QUESTION THAT DESERVES AN ANSWER AND IT DESERVES A LOTS OF THOUGHT. WHAT WILL BE DONE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENTS HOW SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE EITHER WE CARE OR WE DON'T CARE YOU WE ALL OF YOU WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE YOUR PAYCHECKS. YOU'RE WELCOME DID YOU RECEIVE YOUR PAYCHECKS AND THOSE CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE TO NOT BE TESTED AND THOSE CHILDREN WHO TEST WILL WHAT WOULD HAVE TESTED POSITIVE WILL RECEIVE NO SERVICES. AND THOSE PARENTS WILL THINK ALL MY GOODNESS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT I DID I DIDN'T DO SOMETHING FOR MY CHILD BUT IT'S ALSO IT'S A STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT FAILED. AND IT IS THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THERE ARE NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND IT YEAH I GET IT. YOUR BRAND NEW. PLEASE UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S BRAND NEW. WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE A BIT BUT WORKING ON THIS WHO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WEREQUEST AN AUDIT AND THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM. ARE ABLE TO PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND AND WE ALL KNEW IT WAS IT. WILL KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE PROOF. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON YOU. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT. TELL US WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE- WHICH ONLY 27% WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US. WHAT DIDN'T WORK TEAM WE ALL WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILDREN. INSTEAD OF HIDING WELL YOU KNOW IT'S OUR ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS AND WE CAN'T DO THIS AND WE CAN'T DO THAT AND THE PLANS ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AND THE DOCTORS ARE DOING THIS AND IT'S- TOO LONG FORM. THOSE ARE EXCUSES AND WE WOULD NOT USE THOSE WITH OUR OWN CHILDREN. WE WOULD NEVER ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO OUR OWN CHILDREN. NEVER AND YET WE'RE ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN. AND GO UNCHCKED UNTIL WE REQUEST AN AUDIT AND WE HAVE A SUCH A DYNAMIC AUDITOR AND TEAM THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. WE WERE FAILING OUR CHILDREN IN IN IN A CRIMINAL MANNER. IN A CRIMINAL MANNER AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST WHEN WE AS LEGISLATORS ASK A QUESTION WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THE ANSWER IS AN HONEST ANSWER. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO REQUEST ON IT'S- OUR DEPARTMENTS. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND YOU GIVE US AN ANSWER WE GO TO THE BANK WITH THAT. THAT'S NOT HAPPENED FOR MANY YEARS AS I CAN TELL IT'S STILL NOT HAPPENING. WE CAN'T CONTINUE THIS WAY. WE CAN'T CONTINUE THIS WAY WE CAN'T JUST SAY WELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AND- WHAT CAN WE COUNT ON THIS. WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND. AND IF THE- ONE OF THE OTHER HINGS THAT THAT I WANTED TO ASK- THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ABOUT SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLANTS THE HEALTH PLANS FOR THE SANCTIONS AGAINST OUR OWN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE TAKING CARE BUSINESS. OKAY TO DO SOMETHING. AND IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WORK. I SEE YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE IF YOU CANNOT DO IT DON'T ACCEPT THE JOB. AND MAKE US BELIEVE THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN ARE LITTLE CHILDREN. SIX MONTHS OLD ONE YEAR OLD UP TO TWO YEARS OLD THAT COULD HAVE HAD THAT TESTING AND DIDN'T HAVE IT. ONLY 27% IT. THERE'S SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY WRONG HERE AND I LOOK FINE ONE. QUESTION PLACE WAS REYES. WHEN YOU CAME IN YOU CLEARLY KNEW THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS DID YOU DO OR HAVE YOU DONE OR DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO AN EVALUATION OF THE PRIOR LEADERSHIP. NOT JUST AT THE VERY TOP LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL TO SEE WHAT THEY DID WRONG AND TO PUT PLANTS TOGETHER ON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE OTHERWISE YOU NEED TO GET SOMEBODY ELSE IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS THIS IS TOO SERIOUS TO ALLOW IT TO GO ON FOR ANOTHER YEAR ANOTHER TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS. OUR CHILDREN'S LOOK HEALTH IS AT STAKE AND WE CANNOT IT CANNOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL EITHER TINGS CHANGE OR PEOPLE WILL CHANGE OUT YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. I THINK YOU HAVE TO LEADERS SITTING UP HERE THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSION. AND I HAVE TWO GRANDCHILDREN TWO AND A HALF YEAR OLD AND A FIVE YEAR OLD SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. THAT WE'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR OUR CHILDREN LIKE I COMPLETELY GET IT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION. YOU HAVE TO LEADERS THAT CARE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM. TWO WEEKS OF WORKING WITH WITH JC. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUTHOW WE MAKE. THE DEPARTMENT CARE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S OUR JOB AS LEADERS. SO I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT HOW LONG IS THAT GOING TO TAKE. HONESTLY HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT IS IMPORTANT AS IT GETS. THANK YOU. SIR WHY CASKEY PLEASE. FEATHER WELL- I CELEBRATED COURT CASE IN THE STATE BUT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES THERE'S AN INTERPLAY HERE AND THIS IS WE'LL GET TO THE AUDIT AND ALL THAT DISMAY BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US THE MOVIE REMEDIATION THAT'S GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THERE IN THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTCOMES WITH THE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON BECAUSE THIS WORK HAS BEEN GOING ON THE LAWSUIT HAS BEEN SETTLED THE APPEALS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. AND WE KNOW THAT THE WE KNOW THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS GOING ON IN THE DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE COUNTY SO COULD YOU JUST GIVE US AN UPDATE BECAUSE WHETHER THEY WERE TESTED OR NOT TESTED IF THE ENVIRONMENT IS IMPROVED. I'M A BETTING MAN WOULD SAY THE OUTCOME WILL BE BETTER SO CAN YOU GIVE ME A FLAVOR OF HOW THAT WORKS BEEN GOING FROM LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY OF A REPRESENTATIVE FROM ALAMEDA WHO'S LEADING SOME OF THE EFFORT TO MAKE IT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT HOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM. SO ARE. LATER RELATED CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM IS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN WE- CERTIFIED LEAD ABATEMENT WORKERS AND WE ALSO. OVERSEE THE TRAINING THAT TAKES PLACE- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S TEN COUNTIES RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED WITH A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS TO DO ABATEMENT. SO FOR US REALLY ARE TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNEW- IS LONG AS THERE IS LETTING THEM FIREMEN TO A LOT OF THE WORK FOR US. STILL IS NOT IT'S MORE YOU KNOW TREASURY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION AND SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM TO REALLY TRY TO. GET THE NUMBER OF TRAINEES AT THE NEED WE INCREASED OUR TRAININGS- TWO SEVEN I BELIEVE USUALLY. THERE IS- TRAINEES ACROSS THE STATE WE WERE ONLY pABOUT SEVEN TO EIGHT THEY'RE TAKING PLACE WE'RE TRAINING OVER- EACH. CLASS HOLDS ABOUT EITHER ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION. SO WE'RE WORKING WTH THEM ON THAT- HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW. AT THE NEXT- OR SOMEHOW WE CAN GET AN UPDATED- INFORMATION FROM LARRY ASKED TO WEAR THEIR I'D IN TERMS OF ACTUAL SITES THAT THEY'RE BEING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF STARTING SOME OF THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE DEPENDING ON EACH. COUNTY KINDA WHERE THEY'RE AT WITH IT. BECAUSE IT WAS COULD. OF THE THERE WAS A OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IT WAS GOING IN DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT. STICKING WITH THE SUIT WITH THEIR COURT CASE BECAUSE THEY HAD LIMITED TIME. THAT THERE WAS A DEADLINE AND IT WAS A LIMóN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO IN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ALL THESE TRAINING TO DO THE REMEDIATION. SO THAT'S NOT ON YOU GUYS THAT'S ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO WERE LEADING THE CASE. I'M A BIT CONFUSED. PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES YOU DON'T TREAT CHILDREN RIGHT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SEATED TO THE PEDIATRICIAN THAT ACTUALLY SEES THE CHILD SEKARANG. CORRECT WE CONTRACT WITH A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO SEE THE R. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. BECAUSE I'M I'M LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WE ARE I READ THROUGH THE REPORT AND ONE OF THE CRITICISMS ON PAGE THRTY EIGHT AND THIRTY NINE IS THAT THE REGULATIONS TO NOT REQUIRED THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ASK FAMILIES QUESTIONS THEY GOT NEW YORK IN TEXAS IN THERE YOU KNOW ASKING ALL THESE THESE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS. THE PRO THE PEDIATRICIANS IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE NOT PROHIBITED IN CALIFORNIA FROM ASKING THESE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT BEEN EXPOSED TO LEAD. CORRECT YOU ARE CORRECT I MEAN YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT WE'RE HERE ON THIS AUDIT AND YOU DIDN'T ASK THIS QUESTION BUT- THE- PHYSICIAN. AND I WILL CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WAS IN HERE BEGINNING THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING THAT THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE WORK THAT WE WON. WE DO A GREAT JOB OF SAYING YOU NEED TO DO ALL THESE THINGS WE DON'T PUT ANY MONEY ON THE TABLE. THERE'S I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. SAVE THE REGULATIONS WHAT'S THE- MEDICAL COMMUNITY FEEDING BACK DOOR TELLING TO YOU ABOUT THE- ABOUT. THE PROVIDING THIS THEIR- BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE TO. SEE THESE CHILDREN AND DOING THESE AND DOING SEIZE TEST ON THEIR OWN IF WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING TESTS OF THAT'S- IF THAT'S CLEAR YOU KNOW YOU GOT A SICK KITTY COMES IN. SO THEY ACTUALLY DO GET ADDITIONAL INCOME THROUGH PROP FIFTY SIX IN TERMS OF DOING WELL CHILD VISITS OR EVEN SICK VISITS AND THEN AS YOU AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD WE'RE GOING TO ADD THROUGH PROP FIFTY SIX WHEN CMS APPROVED. A SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO DO THE LEAD TEST SO THE ANSWER IS CORRECT I MEAN THE PEDIATRICIAN OR THE FELLOW PRACTITIONER OF JEWEL PRACTITIONERS SEIZE THE CHILD AND THEN THEY DO THE TESTING THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE AGE OR THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OR THE DEVELOPMENTAL INCH EDUCATION. WHATEVER'S NECESSARY FOR THAT CHILD AT THAT AGE THAT'S REALLY THAT'S REALLY WHERE THOSE ACTIVITIES OCCUR. AND THEY ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM ASKING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AROUND IF THEY'RE GIVING SO YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE PROVIDING CARE IN AN AREA THAT HAS RISKS. OTHER THAN LEAD BASED PAINT. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE PLAN ON DOING AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ON IS HOW TO BE BETTER PARTNER WITH PUBLIC HEALTH IN REGARDS TO THEIR HOT SPOTTING REPORTS. ON THAT THEY WILL BE DOING SO THAT IN ADDITION TO JUST THE THINGS THAT WE WALK THROUGH AND ARE REPORTED THAT WE WILL BE DOING WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. HOW DO WE USE THAT TO DRIVE A VERY LASER FOCUS IN VERY CLEAR AREAS OF THE STATE ZIP CODES ARE COUNTIES WHERE WE SEE A HIGHER ELEVATED LEVEL OF THESE BUT THAT. IN ADDITION TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN GET TESTED DON'T TAKE MY COMMENTS THE WRONG WAY- BUT HOW DO WE ALSO DO ADDITIONAL HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY IN THOSE HOT SPOT AREAS THAT. HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WORKING WITH THEIR PLANS VERY CLOSELY IN THOSE AREAS A TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND ON THAT THERE IS A AN INCREASED RISKON IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS AND THEY SHOULD BE TAKING HEIGHTENED FOCUS IN EDUCATING FAMILIES ABOUT THAT RISK IN CASE. YOU'RE FAMILIES DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECLINE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER REGARDING THE TEST BUT MAKING SURE PROVIDERS ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH- BENEFICIARIES AND FAMILIES WHEN THEY COME IN THAT THIS IS A HIGH IN THE AREA. OF RISK IN THAT THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT RISK ON IF DECLINE IN THE TEST AS WELL. AND I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION MR JURORS MEDICALLY I MEAN IT'S I THINK I HEARD DIRECTED TO WE GET THE MEDI CAL AND THE MEDICARE- TESTING. ONE IN AND AT. BUT BY. OF MY TWO AND A HALF. TO AND A HALF TO ONE OR- TWO. ONE AND TWO AND THEN. THE FEDERAL ONLY REQUIRES ONE TEST AT AT ONE- WHERE TO ENTER. TWO AND A HALF HOURS SO THERE'S SO THERE'S DIFFERENT. STANDARDS OUT THERE- THAT THAT THAT ARE THERE. THE. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU GET TESTED AT. AT TWO AND YOU'VE MISSED IN YOU MISS THE TESTS WE MIGHT INSTINCTS IS THAT IF THE IF THE CHILD IS EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD IT WITHOUT SOME REMEDIATION AND SOME CHANGES AS HE COULD BE. LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES RIGHT. ON THE ON THE NATURAL WHAT WITH THE DOCTOR BE DEALING WITH THAT. SIX SHALL THEY CAME IN EVERY LET'S SAY THEY MISS THE ONE THE ONE YOUR TEST BECAUSE WE LEASE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ABOUT ON THE AUDIT YOU GOT TO HAVE THAT SECOND TESTING YOU RELATE ON THE SECOND TEST SO WHAT WAS I GUESS WHAT'S THE- I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ANSWER TO BE WHAT'S THE MEDICAL. IMPACT ON THIS POPULATION OF ALL THE FOR THE MEDICAL IMPACT TO A DOCTOR YOU OVER HERE- BUT SO THERE'S A FEW THINGS SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS- TEST AT ONE AND TWO AND THEN- IF- YOU HAVE NOT HAD A TEST BY. YOU KNOW SIX THAT YOU ARE ALSO GETTING ANY TEST IF YOU MISSED YOUR FIRST AND SECOND BIRTHDAY- THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS RIGHT NOW THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS THAT CMS HAS IN PLACE- OR SOME OTHER ONES. LOOK AT ACTOR SECOND BIRTHDAY WE KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE ON DON'T GET THEIR KIDS IN RIGHT AFTER BIRTH DATE- IN IN REGARDS TO. A WELL CHILD VISITS A GOOD HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS LATER ON AND SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OVER THE- THE TIME SINCE THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT UP OF. HOW O WE LOOK AT THE BROADER CONSTRUCTION OUTSIDE OF JUST THE CLEAR TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS- TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT AND TO MAKE SURE LOOKING AT THE FULL PICTURE NOT JUST THE KIND OF. VARIOUS NARROW IN THERE ARE DIFFERENT NATIONAL STANDARDS VERSES STATE OF CALIFORNIA STANDARDS- TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CAPTURING EVERYONE IF THEYGOT IT SLIGHTLY AFTER THEIR SECOND BIRTHDAY OR TO ENSURE CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF SIX ARE GETTING- TESTED AT SOME POINT. ON AND THEN A LOT DOCTOR GUILDERS SPEAK TO THE OTHER QUESTION. SO THE REAL KEY IS YOU DON'T WANT A CHILD CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED UPDATES TO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE ONE YOU'RE TESTING IN THE TO YOUR TESTING. SO IF YOU'VE GOT A CHILD THAT'S CRAWLING AND YOU KNOW AS EXPOSED TO EITHER. THE EXAMPLE OF- THE FAN THE HUSBAND OR WIFE BRINGING HOME. LED FROM THEIR WORKPLACE AND IT BEING ON THE FLOOR OR LEAD BASED PAINT PEELING OFF THE WALLS. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT THE WITH THE TEST AT ONE AND TWO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT. YOU KNOW OF AN EXPOSURE IS ONGOING AND THEN. ACTUALLY PUBLIC HEALTH IS INVOLVED IN THE MAN BUT THE REMEDIATION. AND REALLY THE KEY IS STOP THE EXPOSURE I MEAN THAT'S THE REAL KEY AND THEN A FEW VERY AYE LEVELS ALLOWED. VERY HIGH LEVELS THERE'S OF THE TWO. HELLO LOOKS TO STOP THE EXPOSURE. AND GET THE KIDS YOU KNOW SO THE SO THE TOUCH TO SAVE YEAH I WOULD JUST SEND THE- I MEAN THE BEAR. EVER. HUGE INTO. CAN POPULATION HE- HAS. RELATIONS IN SOME OF THEM ARE NOT THE ZIP CODE SAID HAVE LEAD AND ALAMEDA COUNTY BUT HAVE THE LEAD PAINT IN THE IN THE MAKE UP THAT YEAH AT THE IN THE CELEBRATION THAT THEY PUT ON THERE FOR IN THESE LITTLE ARE EXPOSED TO AND THEN THE CERAMIC IN THE JEWELRY THAT COMES IN FROM ACROSS THE BORDER THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT EATING YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SAYING OKAY WANT TO TEST THIS AND WE WANT YOU TO. WE WE'RE THE EXPOSURES THAT WERE NOT NATURAL AT EIGHT ONE C. TRADITIONAL BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THE NORMAL CULPRIT THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT SO THAT SAY- A SHIFTING TERRITORY- I'LL BE LOOKING FOR TODAY. UPDATE ON THE AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND THE REMEDIATION PORTION OF BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THERE'S- A NEED FOR COMMUNICATION. AT AT THAT LEVEL WHERE THE WORK IS BEING DONE AND WHERE THE WORKS NOT BEING DEAD FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU SIR PAN. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- APPRECIATE- THE- QUESTIONS THAT- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN ASKING- IRST OF ALL I GUESS- ACTUALLY TO FORCE A DRESS- MY GOOD FRIEND- SERRA CASKEY- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE QUESTIONS TWENTY DESCRIBE WHICH QUESTIONS ARE REQUIRED. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED- PHYSICIANS ASK QUESTIONS BASED ON THE LEVEL OF RISK AND- THE POPULATION THERE ARE WORKING WITH SO THERE IS YES ONE MATED QUESTION- I WILL PRESUME DODD YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG YOU DIDN'T REVIEW ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS FOR ALL THE KIDS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS ARE ACTUALLY ASKED WHAT YOU DID IS YOU WENT SAID WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THAT ONE QUESTIONS REQUIRED. YEAH QUITE REQUIRED THE CALIFORNIA DOESN'T MEAN THEY WEREN'T PASSED THE PILOT ASKED OF EVERY PATIENT AND SO I DO APPRECIATE SO MY COLLEAGUES OF TWENTY ALL NIGHT DID SAY MY OWN REMARKS THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IT'S A SERIOUS NEUROTOXIN WE NEED SCREEN- WE NEED TO TEST- BUT I ALSO DATE NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE- NOT ONLY IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DOCTOR OR IN THE MAIL TIME WE HAVE THE OUT THIS SPURRED ON THE PATIENT SO. ANYONE WHO YOUR CHILD AND I HAVE CHILDREN YOU BRING HOW MANY QUESTIONS YOU GET ASKED AND WHAT WE DO IS TRY TO ARGUE THE QUESTIONS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE I'D WRITE IF WE HAVE TO THAT WE BE ADDRESSING A LOT CERTAINLY BE A BRAND WHAT BUT THERE'S ALSO WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS ARE VERY SERIOUS AS WELL IN FACT. BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT ENTITY TO TEST THAT THOSE. AT THE LEADS. WE SHOULD ALL BE SURE CHECKING PURNIMA. OKAY BUT CHAO IS ANEMIC ALL HAS A IQ JUST LIKE LET AND EFFECTIVE YOUR NAME TO MARVOLO TO LET. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT'S THAT'S SOMEWHAT AUDIT IS BUT IF WE'RE GONNA START TALKING ABOUT THE LAW SO I SHE HOPE WERE NIGHT WE'RE JUST SAYING OH WELL I WAS ON LEAD THERE FOR WE'RE GOING ON DO A- FOR LEAD. WE WERE DOING FOR ANEMIA TO RIGHT THAT WAS THE SUBJECT THIS AUDIT REPORT BUT- IS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW THAT'S JUST AS THAT THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO WRITE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO- LET IS ONE OF MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY SERIOUS TOXIN BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER. THINGS THAT ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT AND IT AGAIN- POOR NUTRITION LACK OF ACCESS TO GOOD FOOD SO FORTH ARE THINGS THAT ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT. COMMITTEES OF COLOR. RIGHT SO- AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO AGAIN I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT AS WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS FROM A SYSTEMATIC POINT OF VIEW. THAT WE'RE JUST NOT LOOKING AT. ONE PARTICULAR AUDIT BUT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND SAYING WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. TO IMPROVE HEALTH- BUT I WOULD ALSO- WANT TO SAY IS THAT CERTAINLY I HEAR MY COLLEAGUES FRUSTRATIONS- WITH- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND- SOME OF THE AGENCIES- YOU KNOW I'VE- BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SINCE TWENTY TENSE A LITTLE LONGER- IF WAS PREVIOUSLY CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE- NOW CHAIR OF. THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE- WE HAVE DONE. YEAH ACTUALLY- QUITE A BIT OF OVERSIGHT- LOOKING AT. THINGS I HI YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD SOME PREVIOUS RESTORATION PARTICULARLY DURING THE- GREAT ART RIGHT AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION OF WHERE. THERE IS A MOVEMENT TO MOVE EVEN MORE. THINGS TO MANAGE CARE- WHERE I IS EXPLICITLY TOLD THE DEPARTMENT UNDER ACTUALLY NOT YOUR PREDECESSOR PROFESSOR BEFORE THEN IS THAT- WE MAY MOVE MORE OF OUR PATIENTS AND MEDI CAL TO MANAGE CARE BUT I WILL ALWAYS HOLD THE- DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES RESPONSIBLE. NOT THE HEALTH PLAN. OKAY YOU CAN'T CONTRACT AWAY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU WROTE THE CONTRACT YOU DRAFTED THE CONTRACT YOU BUT- CONTINGENCIES ON THE CONTRACT YOU STICK THE STANDARDS THE CONTRACT BY THE WAY WE CAN'T EVEN WE DON'T WE'LL SEE A MODEL CONTRACT BUT THE EXACT CONTRACT ITSELF WE DON'T GET TO SEE. RIGHT WE JUST SEE THE MODEL CONTRACT AND- YOU KNOW AND CERTAINLY IF AND I'M I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LITANY OF DIFFERENT OVER SITES AND ALL ITS BY- IT DENTAL BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AND WE HAD. WE FOUND ON THE DENTAL AUDIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOR TEN YEARS DIDN'T DO WHAT THE LAW ASK THEM TO DO TO MONITOR ACCESS. SO THESE THINGS COME UP NOW. I JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY IS YOU KNOW WE DID A HEARING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THE MANAGED CARE ACTUALLY. FOR AT ON THE SENATE SIDE WE TALKED ABOUT OUR MANAGED CARE ACTUALLY TOOK LOOK LOOK BETTER MANAGED CARE CONTRACTING WE DID IT WE'RE LOOKING AT CALLING. I THINK THAT RISE AS A IS THAT YEAH WE HAVE SOME NEW LEADERSHIP HERE I DO THINK THAT- THAT AT LEAST IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE I'VE SEEN SOME VERY POSITIVE SHIFTS IN THE DEPARTMENT- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME IN I MEAN DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO SUFFERING FROM- WE WERE IN THE RECESSION YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERY PLACE WE COULD CUT. OKAY ALL RIGHT. I MEAN THAT'S JUST REALITY BOB I DO THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A- CULTURE SHIFT IN IN THE DEPARTMENT I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AS WELL BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT CONTINUES- SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE PROACTIVE WAS THINGS I CRITIQUE THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE WAS IS THAT THEY WOULD TELL ME. WELL WE'RE MONITORING THINGS. AND I LOOK AT THEM AND SAID WELL IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO MONITOR TO HAS TO BE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WHAT ARE DAY. BECAUSE THERE'S SOME POINT THAT YOU CAN MONITOR SOMETHING'S IT WILL THE RESULT IS THIS AT WHAT POINT YOU SEE THAT RESULT IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S TOO BAD IT'S REALLY BAD YOU KNOW HE'S A- AND DELUDE SO AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT NOW IS SITTING SOME HIGHER STANDARDS RIGHT AND ACTUALLY SAYING THAT THERE ARE THINGS. SO THAT'S A GOOD POSITIVE DIRECTION WE'RE MOVING IN. SO I GUESS WHAT I WANNA SAY IS THAT CERTAINLY I THINK YOU HAVE YOU HEARD FROM. MANY OF US ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN MY VARIOUS ROLES AND THAT THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE- ON HELP- ON HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD I APPRECIATE ACTUALLY THE INVESTMENT THAT. THE STAFF MADE AND CAL AIMS TO TRY TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH- I ALSO RECOGNIZED BY THE WAY THAT- WE PROBABLY ACTUALLY NEED TO STAFF UP THE DEPARTMENT. MORE BANDWIDTH WISE OKAY I MEAN TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS DEPARTMENTS HAD TO ACCOMPLISH. IN THE TIME SINCE LA IT'S I'VE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE- BUT AT SAME TIME EVEN AS WE- STEPPED UP. WE NEED TO ALSO INFUSE A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THE ROLESDEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF BEING MORE PROACTIVE. ABOUT THESE THINGS YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO HAPPEN AUDIT AND THEN SAY. OH WELL SORRY WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO BETTER NOW. LIKE WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW FOR THE AUDIT OKAY SO WHAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DENTAL AND WE CAN SO FOR. ALL RIGHT SO I THINK THAT AND BY THE TIME BY THE TIME WE ASK FOR NOT THERE'S A REASONWE ASK FOR THE AUDIT THERE WERE A LOT OF SIGNS OUT THERE RIGHT SO. I'M HOPING WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE THAT WERE AND I KNOW YOU'RE A STATE YOU UNDER YOU'VE HEARD ME. NOT JUST MONITORING YOU KNOW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS HOW GREAT YOU KNOW TWO HOW DO YOU PROMOTE EXCELLENCE WE TALK ABOUT HOURS. THERE'S A LOT OF SO I SO I WHY DO YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME PROPS THAT THINGS I THINK ARE MOVING IN A MORE POSITIVE ACTION I KNOW. I CERTAINLY- WHY EXPRESS MY HOPE AND MY CONFIDENCE THAT THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP IS GONNA CONTINUE TAKING IT IN THAT DIRECTION. AND THAT HOPEFULLY WE WILL. THAT WE'LL SEE SOME EVEN BETTER RESULTS. KLAY THIS IS AN FOR. ANOTHER CAN A BLACK GUY- THE PREVIOUS AUDITS THAT WE JUST HAD RECENTLY WITH THE AND SORT OF LINKS THE CHILDREN'S SCREENING YOU KNOW THAT THAT PREVENTIVE SERVICES WAS ANOTHER BLACK GUY THAT. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ICING CERTAINLY I THINK- WE HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION BUT- I AM HOPEFUL- THAT- BUT WE WILL BOTH HOPEFUL BUT WE WILL EXPECT AND WE WILL HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO BE SURE THAT WE- ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND ACTUALLY I APPRECIATE THAT THE- HONESTY OF THEIR CURRENT LEADERSHIP AND SAY HEY WE FIND OUT MORE- WILL TELL YOU AND ASK YOU TO HELP US OUT. NOW I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE- BECAUSE I KNOW WE ALSO HAVE CD PEACH HERE- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDIT REPORT ALSO POINTED OUT WAS THAT THE LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM SO WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE A POSITIVE. IS OPERATING AT DEFICIT. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IS AM I EXPECTING MY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE A REQUEST FOR A AUGMENTATION THE BUDGET RIGHT RIGHT A RISE IN THE FEE TO COVER THIS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS THE PRO ACTIVITY ALL RIGHT I MEAN WE YOU CAN YOU CAN SAY WELL THE LEGISLATURE'S JOB TO OF COURSE IN THE END WE FORMULATED BUDGET THAT THEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS WE COME TO AGREEMENT BUT I ALSO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION. NEEDS TO STEP UP AND PROPOSE THINGS AND THEY HAVE FOR CERTAIN AREAS I WANT TO GIVE SOME CREDIT YOU KNOW- THIS GOVERNOR IS NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT SAYING WE NEED SOME MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING BUT AGAIN THIS IS A DEFICIT HERE WE'RE RUNNING A NEGATIVE ARE WE WHAT ARE WE DOING TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO DO THE- CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER THINGS WE NEED DO WE HAVE A POSITIVE IT'S GREAT TO SCREEN PEOPLE WE'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB AT IT WELL HOPEFULLY WE WILL DO BETTER AND THEN WE STILL NEED TO. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YEAH WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING ARE ARE YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO WORK MONITORING I WANNA SOLUTIONS NOT JUST MONITORING. BUT SO IS THERE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR FOR AN INCREASE NEPHI. SO WITH. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY THE AGAIN I CAN I CAN I CAN USE ANOTHER WORD WERE CLOSELY LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET RIGHT NOW IN BASED ON OVER AT OR IS IT IN THE IT OF GOVERNOR SUBMITTED A DRAFT BUDGET JANUARY'S IT IN THERE. IT'S NOT IN THERE OKAY WHY. BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT WERE SSE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'RE STILL NOT IN A PHASE IT WARMER NEEDING TO MAKE THE REQUEST THIS YEAR OKAY SO I HOPE THAT AND REALIZE THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOU AND FINANCE AND I KNOW YOU DO YOUR YOUR YOUR BOSS ISN'T HERE AND SHE'S BUSY DOING. SOME OTHERS NOW SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU IS AN AGENCY- WELL THE DIRECTOR OF REPRESENT AGENCY DIRECTOR CANNOT OPPOSE FINANCE ARE TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND DISAGREE WITH IT SO I WANT TO ASK YOU TO- BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY HERE. THAT PART OF THE BUDGET- YOU CAN RELATE TO. WHOEVER NEEDS TO HEAR- I EXPECT TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. AND PROPOSAL YEAH RIGHT SO AT AND NOT JUST WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. WE ARE TOO ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT ONLY IT'S NOT JUST OUR DEPARTMENT LIKE WE MENTIONED IT'S THE FIFTY LOCAL HEALTH CLIPS THAT DEPEND ON THIS AND IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW OF FOR US MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE. THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT ALMOST ABOUT SIX DIFFERENT BILLS THAT HAVE PASSED AND THEN. THE LAST THREE YEARS SO WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I KNOW YOU WERE MONITORING THAT WE ARE CLOSELY WATCHING OUR EXPENDITURES AND WE WILL BE READY TO PROPOSE SOMETHING ONCE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HEADING THAT AT IS IT I. MINE TRAIN IS. FINE BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. RIGHT AND SO I KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE HOT SEAT RIGHT NOW SO THE OTHER QUICK QUESTION IS THAT. I DO HAVE TO POSE THIS QUESTION BECAUSE AGAIN I UNDERSTAND WHY- DOCTOR ANGEL CAN'T BE HERE AND WHAT SHE'S UP TO- AND MAYBE A CELL THE LOW PERIPHERAL BUT I THINK IS CENTRAL TO THIS SO- OUR STAFF FROM C. PH BEING HAVING TO BE DIRECTED FROM OTHER TASKS. INCLUDING POTENTIALLY LEAD ISSUES ARE PEOPLE PERSONNEL BEING PULLED TO ADDRESS THE CORONA VIRUS OR CUP IN NINETEEN CRISIS RIGHT NOW. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PEOPLE BEING TAKEN OFF IN THE REGULAR JOB SO THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON THAT. NOT OUR CLIP PRO. OKAY NO WE THEIR THEY HAVE THEIR OWN. OKAY AND ALSO AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE CLIP PROGRAM- NO WE HAVE OTHER. FOLKS SUPPORTING FROM OTHER PROGRAMS CENTERS OKAY SO I MIGHT BE SURE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN ITS OF PROGRAMS LIKE THIS SOMETIMES ARE THE ONES THAT GET. PULLED FROM- BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU CRISIS YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE Q. CRISIS. THIS IN ITSELF IS A CRISIS SO WE SHOULD BE SURE WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT CAPACITY AS WELL YEAH I WAS SURE THAT WITH YOU IN AT YOU KNOW WE ARE PULLING ACROSS. EVERYWHERE BID FROM I. CAN CONFIRM THAT FORMER CLIP PROGRAM THERE WAS PRETTY BUSY WITH A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED. OKAY THANK YOU BUT EVERYONE'S BUSY WITH A LOT OF WORK. THANK YOU MOVING AS JUST ADDED TO THE FRUSTRATION FROM FROM THE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. AN ARMY REVISED ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENTS AND YEAH WE EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS FROM THE US. SPECIALLY FROM WHAT'S BEEN EXPECTED OVER THE LAST YEAR TWO YEARS- WITH THAT WE ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCLUDING REMARKS. IF PLEASE OKAY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PASSION AND YOUR INPUT REALLY APPRECIATED. I ECHO THE SAME WE REALLY ARE COMMITTED AND WE WILL YOU KNOW STRIVE TO PERFORMING MEET- YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR COMMENTS IN RESPONSE FROM LOCAL AGENCIES. A BOY WEHAVE DOCTOR ROBERT- BIRD VOCAL DIRECTOR PEDIATRIC AMBULATORY CLINICS ACTING SECTION CHIEF GENERAL. PEDIATRICS WITH UC. DAVIS HEALTH WHEN I WE DID HAVE. MAURICE FROM THE HIGH BRANCH DIRECTOR WITH THE VITAMIN A WHOLE DIVISION LOS ANGELES COUNTY FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH BUT HE HAD TO GO AND CATCH A FLIGHT. SO DOCTOR BIRD WOULD YOU ARE READY POLICE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING. THIS. CORRECT HI. I'LL START BY. VARMINT WHERE KIDS ARE WE CAN PREVENT THEM FROM BEING EXPOSED WE'RE TESTING WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT IF THEY WERE EXPOSED SO I'M ROBERT BYRD I AM A PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL PEDIATRICS AT UC DAVIS WHERE I'VE BEEN FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS PRIOR THAT IT WAS A FELLOW IN JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBER AT UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER AND IN NEW YORK AND PRIOR TO THAT. I WAS AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN THERE ARE EPIDEMIC INTELLIGENCE SERVICE- WHERE I LEARNED EPIDEMIOLOGY SO MY TIME IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SHAPE MY THINKING ON THAT AT THAT TIME 25% OF CHILDREN LESS THAN SIX YEARS OLD HAD A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL ABOVE TEN MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER. 10% HAD ABOVE 25% ARE TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER AND AT THAT TIME THE MEDIAN YEAR OF HOME BUILD WAS- IN THE CITY OF ROCHESTER NINETEEN TEN. AND SO IT'S THERE WHERE I DID A STUDY WITH BRUCE LAMP HERE. COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH LEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN CHILDREN IS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL PEDIATRICS IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IN THERE WE ARGUED FOR SCREENING STRATEGIES THAT I DIE IDENTIFIED HOUSING THAT CONTAIN LEAD HAZARDS RATHER THAN SIMPLY IDENTIFYING. IDENTIFYING ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN CHILDREN AFTER THEY WERE EXPOSED BRUCE LAND FEAR WENT ON TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL AND- THAT'S A PART OF THE DATA THAT HE- PRESENTED AND MULTIPLE PAPERS IS A WHAT HIS LOWERED THE ACTION LEVEL FOR BLOOD LEAD LEVEL TO FIVE FROM ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF TANNED. FROM ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE ONE ROCHESTER I WAS PART OF AN AYE AND THE PUBLISHED ANYWHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT BLOOD LEAD SCREENING INFORMATION AND WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE THE CASES WERE AND- LOOKING AT MULTIPLE CHILDREN FROM POSSIBLE FROM DIFFERENT. WHERE THERE ARE ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL SEEM TO COME FROM THE SAME ADDRESS AND WHAT WE FOUND WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KIDS WHERE LEAD ABATEMENT EFFORTS ERE EITHER LIMITED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL UNIT IN A MULTI FAMILY DWELLING WARS. THAT FAMILY AND THAT CHILD MOVED OUT OF THAT UNIT AND NO ABATEMENT WAS DONE AND ANOTHER CHILD MOVED IN. ESSENTIALLY CAUSING EACH CHILD TO SERVICE THEIR OWN CANARY IN THE LEAD MINE SHAFT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A LEAD HAZARD AND- I REALLY APPRECIATED ONE OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER THAT IN SACRAMENTO. THERE ARE TEN APARTMENT COMPLEXES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF. ELEVATED LAD IN THE COUNTY WHERE I'M AT AND IF WE WERE DOING OUR JOBS IF WE WEREN'T SHE- ONLY TESTING BUT WE WERE DOING THE ABATEMENT THAT WAS NECESSARY. AND A WIDER ABATEMENT- WHERE WE DON'T JUST LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN IN INDIVIDUAL UNITS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT DATA TO LOOK AT RIGHT NOW. SO I APPRECIATED- ONE OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER THAT THE DATA ARE GOOD RESULTS ARE BETTER. IN SOME WAYS WE ALREADY HAVE AN- TO ACT IN DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT KIDS EVEN AS WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE TESTING TO BE DONE AND BETTER DATED TO BE. MADE AVAILABLE. AFTER I CAME TO CALIFORNIA NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT I WAS ON THE CALIFORNIA LED SCREENING ADVISORY TASK FORCE FROM NINETEEN- NINETEEN ONE. THERE I ARGUED FOR SOME FOCUS ON HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS- IN LIMITING LET IT- EXPOSURE AND TARGET IS STRAINING EFFORTS WHERE WE SAW HOT SPOTS. BUT THE DIRECTION IT CAN COMMITTEE WAS TO ADVOCATE FOR UNIVERSAL SCREENING OF ALL CHILDREN RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. FAST FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I DID A STUDY OF MY OWN CLINICS LET'S GREETING EFFORT LOOKED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CHILDREN WHAT I HAV THE ABILITY TO GET DOWN TO A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL THAN THE HUGE VERY IMPRESSIVE STUDY THAT WERE IS THE FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE MEETING- AND THERE ARE. AT THAT TIME THE- GUIDELINE FOR- ACTION LEVEL OF CONCERN WAS TEN AND- WE DID BY THOSE LEVELS ADD. AT TWELVE MONTHS AND THEN A YEAR LATER WE ONLY FOUND ONE CHILDREN ONE CHILD THAT SCREEN POSITIVE. ABOUT TEN MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER IN THE REMAINDER TWO HUNDRED. FORTY CHILDREN NONE OF THEM HAD A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL OVER TEN- IN THEIR SECOND SCREENING SO WE DID. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TEST TWICE SHOWING NO BLOOD THAT LEVEL BUT PART OF THAT IS- THE COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE SERVING AND THE LEVEL OF CONCERN. OF ATTENDED THE TIME FAST FORWARDED NOW THE LEVEL CONCERN IS NOW ABOVE- A FIVE MICROGRAM AND STIRRED- PER DECILITER FOR THE LAD. AND I LOOKED AT MY CLINICS DATA- IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY LAST YEAR I'M JUST TAKING ONE YEAR SWIPE SO I CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE MY CLINIC TESTED THE BLOOD OF SIXTY FOUR CHILDREN. AGES TWO TO FIVE- THIS IS BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY INSURED AND ONLY ONE IT WAS ABOVE FOUR POINT NINE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER AND THAT ONE. IS NINE POINT SIX ON THE FIRST TEST OF THE YEAR AND SIX POINT SEVEN IS SUBSEQUENT TESTING DOWN FROM THE PRIOR YEARS OF ELEVEN POINT FOUR SO AMONG THE- I SIXTY FOUR CHILDREN. ONLY WILL ONE KID WAS IDENTIFIED ME WAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THERE WAS NO NEW CASES OF BLOOD LEAD- IT- THERE WAS IDENTIFIED AS IT WAS GOING THROUGH THIS GRANULAR DATA I SAW ONE CHILD WHOSE LAST YEAR HAD A TASK THAT WAS TWENTY TWO POINT THREE. AND THEN TEN DAYS LATER. WAS ONE POINT FIVE. AND SO WHEN WE HAVE TESTS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A CONTAMINATED FIRST SAMPLE AND THEN WE GET A VENUS SAMPLE AFTERWARDS. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT CHILD HAD A TWENTY TWO POINT THREE. AND THAT THE VENUS SAMPLE WAS TRUE AND MY QUESTION WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LARGE STATUS AT THAT. DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME GRANULAR LEVEL HOW MANY OF THOSE TWENTY TWO POINT THREE CENT TEST LIKE THAT STAY IN THE DATA. THAT DON'T GIVE US GOOD DATA AS TO WHERE OUR KIDS ARE TRULY AT RISK. SO I HAVE QUESTIONS TO- DO WE HAVE THE BEST DATA WE I'VE ALREADY BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF- HIGH LEVELS FOLLOWED BY NORMAL LEVEL IF THE- AUDITOR'S TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT. I AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO LOOK AND SEE WHERE PRIOR TESTS WERE DONE FOR THE KIDS TO GO ON AN OFF MEDI CAL THE GO ON AND OFF PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THEY MAY GET A TEST IN THERE ARE- THERE ARE- HEALTH CARE'S ACILITY WITH THEIR OTHER INSURANCE AND IT MAY OR MAY NOT MATCH UP I RECOGNIZE THERE'S ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM IF WE TOOK OUT THAT NOISE THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND I'VE LOOKING AT MY OWN CLINIC DATA. I SAW THAT- WE TESTED A. A 70% EITHER THEY WERE TESTED OR THEY WERE- PRIOR SCREEN NOT TO THE 80% THATYOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE STATE NOT TO THE 100% THAT I'M LOOKING FOR BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT TESTING AS A RESULT OF THIS- AUDIT REPORT IN MY LOOKING AT MY OWN DATA- I TOOK STEPS TO CONTACT EVERYONE OF THE PROVIDERS GIVING THEM INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION SO THAT ARE TESTING RESULTS OF GET HIGHER BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THAT BY ITSELF. WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND I EXPECT THAT THIS HEARING ACTUALLY WILL IMPROVE TESTING THAT-NUMBER OF PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IT BUT I ALSO AM HOPING THAT COUPLED WITH INCREASED TESTING. WE LOOK AT ABATEMENT AND WE LOOK AT ABATEMENT WIDER THAN INDIVIDUAL UNITS FORCING EVERY CHILD TO BE THEIR OWN CANARY. IN THAT LED MINE SHAFT. IF WE IDENTIFY A UNIT. WHERE THERE'S ONE CHILD WE OBEYED THE ENTIRE UNIT. THEN WE HAVE PREVENT SAID EXPOSURE TOOL A NUMBER OF KIDS AND SO THAT. PART OF MY PERSPECTIVE IS I COULD GET TO A GRANULAR LEVEL I CARE ABOUT. PREVENTING LEAD EXPOSURE IN KIDS- THERE IS NO SAFE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT AS WE IMPROVE TESTING WE ALSO TAKE THE DATA THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE WONDERFUL DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THE AUDITOR SHOW WHERE THESE HOTSPOTS ARE. AND WE DO THE HARDER WORK- OF ABATING. GETTING THE LEAD OUT OF THE LIVES OF KIDS WHERE THE A- LIVE WHERE THEY PLAY- WHERE- THEY'RE FORCED TO BE AT TIMES. NOT HAVING AS MANY CHOICES IN THEIR OWN LIVES AS SOME OF THE REST OF US HAVE SO I WILL TAKE QUESTIONS THAT'S- MY PASSION IS TAKING CARE OF KIDS AND I'M HOPING THAT WE DON'T STOP WITH JUST TESTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ABATEMENT AND YOU KNOW EARLIER IN THE PREVIOUS PANELS WE HAD ASKED ABOUT. THE I GUESS WILL RECALL THE ENACT WHAT ABILITY AND THE METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS. RIGHT TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES IT WAS THE SLIDE IF YOU YEAH I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK ON THAT BECAUSE AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND RUNNING A CLINIC- WE HAND OVER THE ELEVATOR REPORTS TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND WE HEAR WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT CHILD BUT WE ACTUALLY DON'T HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENED FOR. THE REST OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. WE THEY MAY CHOOSE TO MOVE OUT OF THAT PLACE AND THEN WE DON'T HEAR ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THAT PLACE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU MAY ASK JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR PAN CENTER PANEL PLEASE. THANK YOU AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN DOCTOR BURKE. COLLEAGUES AT UC DAVIS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT- CERTAINLY WELL THE AUDIT FOCUSED ON SCREENING AND THE AB AND THEN THE LACK OF- SCREENING AND PARTIALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE FACT THAT WE ALSO HAVE LOW PERCENTAGES MEDI CAL PATIENTS ARE. GETTING THEIR HEALTH TO PROVISIONS. BUSINESS ALTOGETHER SO NOT ONLY MISSING LEAD TO PRIVACY A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER SCREENING THINGS. THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- CLEAN DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OR DOING. ASUS AND- LOTS OF OTHER THINGS- THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE FOR REALLY GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST THAT THE OTHER DAY AND THEN A FINAL PROBLEM- THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY- SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FUNDING FOR MITIGATION WHICH IS WHY ALSO POSE THE QUESTION I MEAN WE HAVE A FUN THAT'S- IN THE DEFICIT. THAT'S THAT THAT IS DEFICIT SPENDING AND WE- WE- AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS AND AT AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE DR BIRD SAID THAT. THIS PEDIATRICIANS WE SEE WE SEE SOMEONE HAS A HIGH LED BE REFERRED BACK TO THE PARK PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT I MEAN IT'S- IT'S REALLY AYE WE WILL YOU KNOW WEEK THERE CERTAIN TREATMENTS TO BRING FROM REALLY HIGH TO. HIGH ARE DOWN TO LOW BUT NOT LOW ENOUGH AND SO ULTIMATELY IT IS ABOUT REMOVING THE EXPOSURE AND SO THAT BECOMES A FUNCTION PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE NEED TO BE SURE PUBLIC HEALTH. THOSE HAS THE FUNDING BUT ALSO HAS THE WELL I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE BIT OF FRUSTRATON ABOUT. THAT BE SURE THE PUBLIC THAT'S. AND I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT I'M SAYING THAT THE THAT IT DOWN TO REALLY CHASE DOWN AND GET THIS DONE IT'S NOT EASY. I% ALWAYS NOT EASY TO GO TO A LANDLORD AND SAY OH BY THE WAY- WE HAVE TO GO AND- CLEAN UP THIS PLACE AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE OUT AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING WHILE THEY'RE MOVED OUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE REVENUE FROM THIS PLACE AND- ETCETERA TO GO AND- FIND IT AND REMOVE. THE SOURCES OF LEAD THAT MIGHT BE IN THERE AND THEN OF COURSE. YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE OTHER SOURCES ALLEGE ASIDE FROM HOUSING ITSELF AND SO THAT WE MAY RUN TO SOME CULTURAL ISSUES OR SOME OTHER. ISSUES AS WELL THAT THE IN THAT REGARD BUT- WE DO NEED TO BE SURE PUBLIC HEALTH. HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO THESE THINGS. SO LET IS NOT CHEST. PAIN AND HOUSES ISSUE WHEN IT OUT AND I THINK THE LEAD SCREENING PROGRAM IN MICHIGAN AND- ALLOWED US TO FIND THAT THERE WAS LED IN THE WATER- AND THAT. WHEN THERE'S A HOT SPOT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT IS AND FOCUS EFFORTS TO. TRY TO PREVENT ON GOING EXPOSURES AND TO- BEST USE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. ALTHOUGH WE CAN ASK FOR BETTER DATA- AT BEST USE NOW WHAT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. TO PROTECT THE KIDS AS BEST WE CAN WITH THE CURRENT DATA ASKING FOR MORE TESTING ASKING- FOR BETTER DATA OF. THERE'S ALREADY ENOUGH. DATA THAT WOULD SUCK IF IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S HANDS HERE THAT- THERE SHOULD BE ACTION. AND IT'S NOT JUST WITH MORE TESTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS I KNOW BUT THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO- THIS IMPORTANT WORK WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THATWILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU COULD PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOUR ORGANIZATION IF YOU'RE WITH AN ORGANIZATION OR- THE COUNTY IN WHICH YOU RESIDE. PLACE PROCEED GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FIRSTLY YOU WANTED THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT- ON ON ON THIS ISSUE- WE APPRECIATE THAT PROGRESS TAKES TIME BUT THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO INSURE MEDI CAL CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING THE MANDATE IT BLED LET SCREENING AND APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP CARE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. DATING BACK YEARS AND EVEN DECADES. THE OBLIGATION IS CLEAR AND WE ASK DH CS TO DO ITS JOB IN ENFORCING LONG STANDING REQUIREMENTS TO PLAN IN FORCE THAT NOW.

THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OF A COMMENT PLEASE CAN LARA'S REPRESENTING CHILDREN NOW AND WANTED TO COMMEND THE AUDITOR FOR HER WORK AS WELL AS- AND THE COMMITTEES ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT IMPACTS CHILDREN'S HEALTH ENVELOPMENT.

AND NOT JUST IN THE BLOOD LEVELS LED SCREENINGS BUT ALSO IN OTHER AREAS AROUND WELL CHILD CHECK UPS AND I'M AND GENERAL ACCESS TO PROVIDERS.

THANK YOU PLEASE. HI KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I AM HERE ON THEIR BEHALF AND ALSO ON THE BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. TO APOLOGIZE THAT THERE WERE NO LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES HERE TODAY IT DOES NOT REPRESENT. ANY SORT OF UNWILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE IT'S JUST THAT WE ARE WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FULL TIME ON COVERT NINETEEN IN MY FIFTEEN YEARS AND HOW I GOT NEVER SEEN. AN ALL OUT EFFORT LIKE THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING SOME DETAILS ABOUT IT WITH CENTER PANTS COMMITTEE ON THURSDAY MORNING THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLACE HELLO MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND I JUST WANT TO START FIRST OF ALL BY JUST THINKING. THE J. LACK MANY. HEALTH COMMITTEE YES TâM EQ COMMITTEE IS FOR. FIRST OFF FOR THEIR INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE AND CLEARLY THEIR COMMITMENT AND THEIR DESIRE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM- WE ATE THE VERBAL WORKING GROUP KIND OF. CAME UP. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR A LONG TIME REMIND EVERY I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE AUDITOR DID SEVERAL AUDITS ON THE SAME ISSUE AND CAME UP WITH SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS- ABOUT THE LEAD POISON PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND WHEN WE WERE SO FORTUNATE TO SPONSOR- A BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK IN A SWIMMER GARCIA REGARDING. THE BLOOD LET TESTING REGULATIONS UPDATING THOSE REQUIRING UP THE AN UPDATE OF THAT THOSE REGULATIONS. WE TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THE DATA WORK KIND OF JUST BASED ON WHAT WE COULD PIECE TOGETHER STARTED TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE IT APPEARED TO STILL BE ANOTHER PROP PROBLEM. AND DID SOME PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST WITH% THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT AS A RESULT OF THAT AND- NOT ONLY DID WE KIND OF GUESSTIMATE- ABOUT 28% OF THE KIDS WERE GETTING TESTED THAT KIND OF MATCH. THE MORE GRANULAR DATE THEM IN THE MUCH MORE DETAILED DATA THAT THE AUDITOR- PRESENTED. IN HER REPORT BUT WE ALSO CAME ACROSS IN OUR IN THE COURSE OF A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. THE THAT NUMBER 88% AND THAT BEING 88% OF CHILDREN ON MEDIC HOW IT'S USED. 88% OF CHILDREN HER BLOOD LEAD POISONED CORN THE DEFINITION OR MEDI CAL. AND THAT JUST SCREAM TO US THAT HEY YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY MISSING OUT THESE WERE MISSING THEN THESE KIDS- AND- SO WE'RE VERY PLEASEDTHAT YOU OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKING THIS TO HEART AND TRYING TO ADDRESS AND- SO COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AND WE'RE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS MADE TODAY- BUT IT WOULD ALSO. LIKE TO. ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY. THE DOCTOR WHO JUST CALM WHO JUST TESTIFIED THAT. NO ABATEMENT IS REALLY OUR CORE CONCERNS AND I'M WE NEED TO TEST THE KIDS BUT IT'S A TOOL- APPROACH REALLY THAT'S NEEDED AND- SO WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON TRYING TO IDENTIFY BUT GOOD WAYS TO- START TO. GET LED OUT OF CHILDREN'S HOMES OUT OF THERE IN AND OUT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS AND TO PROTECT THEM FROM IT. TO BEGIN WITH SO WE PUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS CAN THIS. HEARING AND AGAIN AND ALL THE INTEREST IN IT THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE YES. OR THIS. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE MACKLIN I'M REPRESENTING THE- COALITION OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHT FORM. SERVICES ATTORNEY. UP MY INTEREST IN THIS WAS OF COURSE PICKED BY. THE INTEREST I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES. ARE IN POVERTY NOT JUST COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THINKING. THE AUDITOR AND HER STAFF FOR A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PLEASE OF PUBLIC WORK. BUT HERE'S THE THING. AS DR BRADLEY SAID THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT ALIGNMENT. THERE IS THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS WHICH I KNOW US ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS IS CONCERNED WITH IF YOU GO ON EACH OF THE WEBSITES FOR THE COUNTIES THAT WERE NOTED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THERE WAS NO INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR ONE COUNTY IF YOU'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET THERE ABOUT LEAD POISONING AND TESTING. THE STATE. HERE'S AN AGENCY AN ENTITY THAT SUPPOSED TO SERVE PARENTS OF CHILDREN. UP TO FIVE YEARS OLD IT DOESN'T HAVE INFORMATION AND THERE IT IS. COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THE WONDERFUL MATERIALS THAT THE LEAD PREVENTION BRANCH PRODUCES IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SO THEY CAN POST THEM IN THEIR OFFICES WERE FAMILIES ARE COMING TO GET MEDI CAL OR OTHER SERVICES. PUBLIC LIBRARIES. PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THERE'S AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE PROVIDED INFORMATION SIMPLE ONE THAT CAN START WITH THE WICK PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY ORIENTED TOWARD THE CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE RECEIVING THIS TEST I GUESS THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THANK YOU FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS- IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT EVERY NEWS ARTICLE THAT COMES ACROSS IN. SENATOR PAN YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT CHILDREN'S EXPOSURE IN THE CITY OF DETROIT WHAT THE DISCOVERED IS THAT WELL OLDER CHILDREN IN A FAMILY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD LEAD EXPOSURE THE YOUNGER CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN WHEN THE CITY WAS IN ITS MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION WHEN THERE ARE A LOT OF. SOCIALIST SAY UNDOCUMENTED OF CARE DOWNS WAS GETTING AIRBORNE EXPOSURE TO LET. SO ALL AND THERE WAS THE REPORT THAT WAS DONE I THINK BY. REUTERS OR ONE OF THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER ART ETHICAL ALL THAT THEY FOUND LEAD POISONING OF UPPER MIDDLE CLASS CHILDREN IN KANSAS CITY LIVING IN HOUSES THAT WERE BEING REMODELED. SO THIS IS A MUCH BROADER PROBLEM IT HAS AMAZING CONSEQUENCES AND WE ARE IN A POSITION TO STOP IT THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE GET AS MANY KIDS DRESSES AS WE CAN. LET ME ASK AT THIS TIME WITH THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT HEARING AND SEEING ON I WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE DíAS LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY- CLOSING REMARKS- HEARING AND SEEING NINE LET ME JUST SAY THAT I THINK ABOUT A MONITORED YOUR TEAM FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I THINK YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED. A LOT OF THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THE MEMBERS FELL- WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR BEING HERE- DH CS AND CITY PH AND DOCTOR BIRD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL- GET OVER THESE- DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO KEEP HAPPENING WE EXPECT TO SEE PROGRESS BEING MADE. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THAT IN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS OUTLINED BY MEMBERS- THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY EXPECT THIS TO BE BROUGHT UP AGAIN DURING OUR- BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS OR SUBCOMMITTEES. AND ESPECIALLY WITH J. LIKE IF WE DON'T SEE ANY ANY PROGRESS ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE THIS. THIS HEARING. AT SIX OH FIVE YOU.
