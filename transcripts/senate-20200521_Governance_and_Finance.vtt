AND ONE QUESTION ON IN THE

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:54.357
OCEAN I REMEMBER SITTING ON A

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.159
CAR A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WITH

00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:57.327
WALLY KNOX IF YOU REMEMBER THAT

WATSON DAN WATSON SOME YEARS

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.235
AGO DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.703
HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.271
FOR A LONG TIME. JUST FOR THE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:11.508
RECORD IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.777
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS TAX

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:16.579
CREDIT THINGS ARE TOUGH AND YOU

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.914
KNOW I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.382
WHERE THE MOTION PICTURE

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.484
BUSINESS IS PRETTY BIG. A LOT

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.486
OF GROUPS AND FOLKS THAT WORK

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.055
IN THE DAY TO DAY ARE THERE AND

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:25.855
A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:27.791
IMPACTED WITH THEIR LOCKS

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.626
MISTER BAKERIES OR WHATEVER.

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.628
AND WE HAVE A AN INDUSTRY IN

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:32.996
THE MOTION PICTURE BUSINESS

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.898
THAT. GO TO GEORGIA LOUISIANA

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:38.301
OR CANADA. AND SO YOU KNOW THE

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.569
ARGUMENT ABOUT THESE TAX

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:43.039
CREDITS. ON THE HAVE DIFFERENT

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:45.709
DIMENSIONS TO THEM. WE LEARNED

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:48.278
THE HORRIBLE IMPACTS WHEN

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:50.513
SOMEBODY WHO WORKS AS AN

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.883
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ON THE FILM.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.618
HAS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:57.687
FAMILY FOR SIX WEEKS. WITH

00:55:57.754 --> 00:56:00.290
THOSE ARE FACTORS THAT WE LOOK

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.258
TO AND ANNOUNCER IN THIS REGARD

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.060
SHEER DIAGNOSTIC IS CRITICAL I

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:06.062
DON'T DISAGREE. BUT I THINK

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:07.964
THAT THESE ARE SO COMPLEX

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.632
BECAUSE ON THE FACES ALWAYS

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.202
EASY TO SAY OR MY GONE YOU'RE

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:13.336
GIVING THESE TAX CREDITS WILL I

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.105
LOST THE HIT WILL HEAD QUARTERS

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:15.805
OF THE COMMITTEES ARE PRESENT

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:18.141
FROM MACY'S. BECAUSE THEY JUST

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.110
LEFT IN A WE LOST TO THE

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.778
COMPANY THAT PUT THE SPACE

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.313
SHUTTLE ON THE MOON FROM THE

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:24.714
COMMUNITY THE HENRY STERN

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:27.584
REPRESENTS. AND THERE'S A

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.419
COMPLEX SERIES OF FACTORS THAT

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:31.554
GO INTO THIS AND YOU MARIE THAT

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:33.456
WITH OTHER IMPACT TONIGHT WITH

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:36.860
WHICH CONCERNS ME AS WE MOVE

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:40.830
FORWARD I JUST THINK IT'S A-

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:41.931
PORTENT. IS ON THE- CLEAR THE

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.801
DIAGNOSTIC HAS TO BE MADE BUT-

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:47.637
BEING OF THESE PACKS MUST BE

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:48.371
CONSIDERED RATHER THAN JUST

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:50.406
THIS A YOU KNOW BALANCE SHEET

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.342
APPROACH BECAUSE THERE'S SO

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.110
MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES IN THE

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.613
AREAS THAT WE CARE ABOUT SO.

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.414
IT'S EASY TO JUST JUMP ON IT

00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.949
AND SAY OH MY GOD THIS HURTS

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.251
THE BUDGET NERVES ALL THESE

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.453
THINGS AND OFTEN THERE ARE

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.554
POLITICAL GROUPS THAT HAVE A

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.322
LOT OF POWER THAT ENGAGE DO.

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.024
YOU KNOW COULD SOME OF THE

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:10.827
WRONG AND IS POST SOME THAT ARE.

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.295
I CLEAN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.597
MADAM CHAIR. THAT SHOULD SHOULD

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:15.765
BE CHANGED BECAUSE THE TIMES

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:18.201
HAVE CHANGED THERE'S REASONS. I

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.436
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IS

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:22.705
WE THINK THIS THROUGH- THAT WE

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.240
GET GUIDANCE TO LOOK AT IT IN

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.109
THE BROADEST CONTEXT AND THAT

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.677
OFTEN IT'S NOT JUST A BALLOT

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.579
SHE DIAGNOSTIC IT'S A MUCH

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.614
DEEPER DIAGNOSTIC. THE SECOND

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.283
COURT THE SECOND PART OF MY

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:35.318
ENQUIRIES A QUESTION. THE BILL

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:36.753
WAS VETOED LAST YEAR ABOARD FOR

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.189
IT WAS VETOED YOU ON PAGE EIGHT

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:44.994
OF THIS ANALYSIS THERE ARE. ONE

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:45.595
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:46.963
EIGHT NINE CHANGES. BUT YOU

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.097
KNOW THE QUESTION IS ARE WE

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.799
WASTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:52.068
GOING BACK AT THIS BOOK I'M NOT

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.469
SUGGESTING WE ARE BECAUSE IT

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:54.537
TOOK FORTY TWO TIMES TO PASS

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:56.005
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:58.741
CONGRESS. BUT IS THIS SOMETHING

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.643
WHERE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.778

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:06.916
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE TO HAVE A

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:08.551
BETTER CHANCE AND IF WE DON'T

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.819
IT'S STILL A VALUABLE IDEA

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.921
DON'T TAKE IT AWAY I JUST

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.590
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND. AS YOU

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:14.924

LITTLE BIT OF A

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:31.975
MISUNDERSTANDING LAST YEAR- AND

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:34.377
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.346
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.014
TO CLARIFY WHAT EXACTLY THIS

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.649
BILL IS INTENDED TO DO AND AS

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:53.630
NEED FOR THESE OTHER TAX

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.632
CREDITS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:58.568
ARE INDEED QUITE VALUABLE. AND

00:58:58.635 --> 00:58:59.836
WE'RE NOT TO THE THIS BILL

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:02.572
DOESN'T SAY HEY. X. Y. AND Z.

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:03.673
HAPPENS THEY'RE GOING TO THROW

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.676
THAT OUT WHAT IT DOES IS TO

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:09.112
CALL UPON THE UNIVERSITY TO DO

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:14.350

AND POLICY OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.689
TO THE STATE THEN IT COMES TO

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.658
THIS COMMITTEE WHERE IF THERE

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.927
IS A CONCERN THAT PERHAPS A

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.561
FAMILY BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IS

ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO THE STATE

AND THAT HASN'T BEEN CONSIDERED

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.803
IT CAN BE FACTORED IN AND THEN

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.272
IT CALLS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:39.609
DO ITS OVERS OVER THIS SO THERE

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.411
ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS HERE.

AND CONTRARY TO THE SUGGESTIONS

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.019
THAT WERE MADE ALL WE HAVE NOW

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:53.690

THAT WE LOSE BECAUSE OF THEM

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:10.206
PERIOD IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.774

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.681
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.350
THAT'S WHY THE AUDITOR SAID HEY

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.185

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.414

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.279
OVER RESILIENCY. RIGHT IT MAY

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.248
BE CHEAPER TO BUY SOMETHING IN

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.016
INDONESIA VIETNAM OR SOMETHING

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.484
BUT YET THEY'RE STINGS WITH THE

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.386
SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED OR ALL

KINDS OF THINGS. THAT MAYBE

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:33.222

THOSE THINGS. SHE TO REIMAGINE.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.118
AS WE SEEK TO BUILD AND I WHAT

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.319
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT

HAVE ANOTHER BILL IT'S BEFORE'S

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.395
LATER TODAY BUT IT DID IT WOULD

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.498
REQUIRE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.067
WONDER IF WHY WE'RE NOT

TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING TO SEE

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.442
WHAT'S GOING ON SO I'M A LITTLE

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:03.212
CONCERNED. ABOUT SETTING UP A

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.215
WHOLE NEW BOARD- AT THIS TIME I

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.383
JUST I'M JUST UNCOMFORTABLE

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.885
JUST IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A GOOD

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.553
PROJECT FOR OUR FELLOWS PROGRAM

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.023
IS TO DIG IN AND- DO THIS AND

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.860
FIGURE IT OUT. SO. I'M THE

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.362
THING THAT MAKES ME EVEN. THE

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:20.630
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE IS THE FACT

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:23.900
THAT EVEN AFTER WE DO ALL THIS

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:24.534
YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.969
LEGISLATURE. AND I WATCHED THE

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:29.105
MOVIE CREDIT BUILD TWO YEARS

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:34.043

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.810
WANT TO DO ANY MORE CREDITS

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:35.878
BECAUSE I NEED MONEY TO PAY

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:39.682
DOWN THESE PENSIONS. AND SO I

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.083
THINK I WAS THE ONLY ABSTENTION

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.718
ON THAT BILL EVERY OTHER

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:45.021
SENATOR VOTED FOR THE CREDIT IT

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.956

ARMY HAVE ANY DISCUSSION IT

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:53.262
JUST KIND OF FLEW RIGHT THROUGH

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:56.032
SO. SO IT'S KINDA CAPRICES EVEN

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:56.632
AFTER WE DO ALL THIS WORK FOR

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.234
STILL GONNA FIND AN EMOTIONAL.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.670
HOOK AND THEN IT'LL BE IGNORED

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.505
AND- SO THEREFORE I AT THIS

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.141
TIME BECAUSE OF. THE CURRENT

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.677
CLIMATE I WILL FIND MYSELF OF

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.378

QUESTION- FOLLOWED WITH A

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.993
COUPLE COMMENT FOLLOWED BY A

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.996
QUESTION- PLEASE CORRECT ME IF

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:27.863
I'M WRONG I NOTICED THAT IN AND

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.433
OF THE STATE OF THE BILL. IT

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:33.569
INCLUDES ABOUT WHAT IS TO BE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.605
ASSESSED AND THAT INCLUDES THE

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.674
FARM EQUIPMENT OUR MACHINERY.

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:42.812
ESERVER IT REASON OR PURPOSE

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.914
FOR HAVING THAT IN THERE OR- HI

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:48.050
YES IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. OF

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.619
THAT FORM TAX CREDIT I THINK

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.853
GOES BACK TO THE FORTIES

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.956
THROUGH THE FIFTIES- IT MAY BE

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.091
THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY THERE

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.659
OR NOT PROBABLY IT MAYBE WE

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.261
SHOULD INCREASE IT. IT MAY BE

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.829
THAT WE SHOULD DECREASE IT IT

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.330
MAY BE THAT WE SHOULD JUST KEEP

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.300
IT AS IT IS THERE MAY BE A-

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.202
FARM MACHINERY MAYBE THERE'S A

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.436
TYPE OF FARM MACHINERY THAT WE

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:09.505
SHOULD INCENTIVIZE OVER ANOTHER

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.240
BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF PRODUCTS

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.508
THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED WE

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.443
JUST HAVE NEVER LOOKED AT IT IT

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.178
DOES GENERATE TO I BELIEVE WE

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.047
LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE- CREATE

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:20.616
A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OF

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:23.319
A TAX CREDITS TO THESE

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.087
DIFFERENT ENTITIES IT'S A LOOK

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.956
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS THAT

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:29.525
PRESUMES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.328
WHAT IT DOES IS WHAT WE DID IS

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:32.962
WE LOOKED AT THE VARIOUS

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.764
TACTICS PICTURES CREDITS THAT

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.832
WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR A PERIOD

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.368
OF TIME THAT CREATED WHAT AT

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.070
LEAST A ONE BILLION DOLLAR A

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:45.675
YEAR OR MORE. EXTRA AND THAT

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:46.776
THESE WERE THE FOR. I THINK

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.210
ELEVEN OR TWELVE THAT WE

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.446
OBSERVED WHERE WE HAD NEVER

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.748
DONE ANY OF THIS ANALYSIS. SO

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.417
THE NOTION THAT BY DOING THE

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.484
ANALYSIS WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:59.689
THE CREDIT. I THINK IS NOT WHAT

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.824
THIS BILL. WILL DO OR IS

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.859
DESIGNED TO DO. IT IS JUST

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:05.728
SIMPLY DESIGNED TO LOOK AT

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.930
THESE. CREDITS THAT HAVE

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.765
RESULTED IN THE SIGNIFICANT-

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:13.102
TAX EXPENDITURES- AND TO

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:15.137
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.872
HAD A HAVE DONE WHAT IT IS THEY

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.474
WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. BE ARE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.576
STILL RELEVANT AND SEE WHAT WE

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.079
CAN DO EITHER TO. ADJUST THEM

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.481
TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.115
TIME IS SENATOR HERTZBERG SAID

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.751
RESILIENCE. IS NOW POTENTIALLY

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.353
A CRITERIA MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.188
TEN YEARS AGO. BUT THE BEAUTY I

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.789
THINK OF THIS MEASURE IS THAT

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:36.492
IT CALLS FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.394
CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS A RESEARCH

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.262
INSTITUTION PROBABLY THE FINEST

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.264
IN THE WORLD IS WILLING TO DO

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:45.034
WITH THIS STUDY WITHIN PUT BY

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.936
THE WAY ON A VARIETY OF

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:48.904
CRITERIA. YEAH AND POTENTIALLY

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:49.839
INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.608
SUGGESTED IN THE- OPPOSE BUT IT

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.377
MEANT. I DON'T WANT TO BE

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.177
STANDING HERE I'M NOT A

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.979
FINANCIAL EXPERT TELLING THEM

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.014
WHAT THAT HAS TO INCLUDE I WANT

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.150
THEM TO DETERMINE BASED UPON

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:02.518
WHAT THE INTENT IS OF THIS

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.153
LEGISLATION. WHICH IS TO

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.055
ANALYZE AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:08.224
THESE TAX EXPENDITURES DID WHAT

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.358
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ARE YOU

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.293
STILL DOING ITS OF THEY SHOULD

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.928
BE CONTINUED. SO WE HAVE THEM

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.663
DOING THE DATA AND THE FACT

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.499
FINDING WE THEN TAKE IT TO THE

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.567
FINANCIAL EXPERTS THE STATE TO

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.936
DO THE ANALYSIS. THEY DO THE

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.772
ANALYSIS THEN THE PUBLIC A

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.541
CHANCE TO HAVE INPUT AND THEN

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:27.910
COMES TO. AS POLICY MAY. THE

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.312
SITE WE WANT WITH THE XIN.

PARTICULAR. WAY TO UNDERSTAND

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.840
THE ECONOMICS OF THAT AREA. I

VIEW OF THE EXPERTS IN

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.995
ECONOMICS. THEY ARE GOING TO

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.498
PROVIDE THAT BASELINE FOR US

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:04.300
THEN WE ARE GOING TO THAT THERE

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.368
THERE WILL BE THE LAYERS.

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:07.336

OF THE ECONOMIC PLACE THAT

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.009
CREDITS. WHAT I CALL ECONOMIC

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.276
PLACE LIKE THE CENTER OF

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:24.313

RESEARCH INTO MINE. THE

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.998
INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE OF

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:45.267
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN OUR

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:48.203
UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE SYSTEM.

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.571

THE ECONOMY THAT WE NOW HAVE SO

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:16.131
I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.433
THAT THIS. THEY ARE INDEED UM

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.202

BENEFITTED CALIFORNIA.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.342
IMMENSELY BEYOND WHAT WE CAN

THE OF THE TAX CREDIT WE HAVE

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:39.688
TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE HAVE

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.423

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.794
CREATED A POOR ECONOMIC PLACE

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:49.865
SILICON VALLEY WHICH- I THINK-

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:50.733
I WOULD QUESTION THE

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.302
AGRICULTURAL BE THE NUMBER ONE

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.803
THING TO THE CAR I THINK

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.806
TECHNOLOGY IS. PROBABLY A

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.842
LITTLE BIGGER IN TERMS OF THE-

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:02.544
REVENUE THAT WE GET IN TERMS OF

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:07.282

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.802
SINGLE MINUTE HAVE BEEN

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.772
COMPETING AGAINST US. AND

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.507
THEY'RE STILL DOING IT AND THEY

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.076
STILL WILL DO IT BUT WE HAVE

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.646
BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF THE

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:40.315
FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS. THIS

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:44.520
PIECE. TOGETHER BENEFIT FOR

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.188

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS

01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:14.067
CALLED CO EIGHTEEN. THE

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:15.435
POSSIBILITY THAT AN

ESTABLISHED- THERE'S A LINE OF

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:25.245
CASES- AND IT'S AN OBVIOUS

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.180
CONTEMPT LEADS TO THE LOSS IN

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:29.382
VALUE OF PROPERTY. LEGISLATORS

THE CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR WELL-

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:36.156
IT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S PRAGUE

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:38.191
TO INTERPRET IT. IN ADDITION TO

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:40.827
THAT BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.862
NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE BUT

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:44.364
JUST A FEW YEARS AGOSENATE

RANCH FOR A MATH IN LEAGUE OF

01:51:58.044 --> 01:51:59.913
IN THERE AGAIN I DON'T THINK

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.314
ANYONE WOULD SAY THAT THOSE

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:03.016
HOUSES WERE NECESSARILY HIT

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:06.486

EQUALIZATION BUT WE DON'T THINK

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:17.297
THAT THAT CASE I DON'T THINK

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:19.532
THAT CASES ON POINT BUT THE

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:20.800

SURE OF ANY PHYSICAL DE. YOUR

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:27.807

REALLY- AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:34.981
AGAIN HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.950
THAT INTERPRETATION. ANOTHER

01:52:37.016 --> 01:52:38.651
LARGE ISSUE RACES HOW TO HOW TO

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:40.420

VALUE. BOB AND I DON'T ACTUALLY

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:46.526
THINK THAT THAT IS A SERIOUS

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.961
QUESTION THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:50.830

FOR THE CALLIE T. I. T. C. IS%

02:41:24.207 --> 02:41:25.776
THAT THEIR INCOME IS SO LOW

THAT THEY DON'T GET ANY MONEY

02:41:27.310 --> 02:41:29.079
BACK THEY JUST DON'T GET ANY

02:41:29.146 --> 02:41:31.515

FILING A AN INCOME TAX RETURN

02:41:34.317 --> 02:41:37.187
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY THEY

02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:38.655
HAVE NO IDEA THAT THERE

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:40.123
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS CAL CAL

02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:41.091

FRANKLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT IT

02:41:52.002 --> 02:41:54.304
IS A REAL STEP IN THE DIRECTION

02:41:54.371 --> 02:41:55.739
OF A PUTTING REAL CASH INTO

02:41:55.806 --> 02:41:57.741
PEOPLE'S POCKETS AND WHAT ENDS

02:41:57.808 --> 02:41:59.309
UP HAPPENING IS THAT THE

02:41:59.376 --> 02:42:01.211
