SIGNIFICANT LOCAL INVESTMENT.

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.383
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.784
PARTNERED WITH LEVI STADIUM IN

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:43.821

JUST IN SAN JOSE ALONE.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.811
I IMAGINE THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.446
INVESTMENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.181
