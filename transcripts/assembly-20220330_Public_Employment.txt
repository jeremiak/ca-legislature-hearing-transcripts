IN THIS MORNING- WHAT ARE THE MARKET CAP RANGE WE'VE ALL KNOWN FOR SO MANY YEARS SOLIS LONGER VERY FINE PERSON SOMEONE'S IN THE BUILDING LONG TIME IS FOR SORT OF A DEJA VU EXPERIENCE. BUT THE VERY. IMPORTANT PART OF OUR COMMUNITY SO I ACTUALLY FEEL. IMPELLED TO SAY SOMETHING AS WE LAUNCH- THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MISTER CODE VERY APPROPRIATE- SO IT'S AN HONOR TO THEY'D BE HE'D BE HERE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE ON MARCH THIRTIETH. GOOD MORNING ASSURE MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY THREE. WHICH CLARIFIES THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE JUDGES BENEFITS FROM THE JUDGE OF RETIREMENT SYSTEM- WHICH IS BOTH THE JUDGE RETIREMENT SYSTEM THE JUDGE RETURNED SYSTEM TO. OUR TO BE REDUCED WINNER BENEFITS REACH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE LIMIT. SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING TO RECONCILE JUDGES PENSION SYSTEM WITH APPLICABLE LAW. CURRENT FEDERAL TAX LAW CAPS REPUBLIC OPPOSED TO FIND PENSION BENEFIT TO A SPECIFIED DOLLAR AMOUNT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT IS CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEREFORE AN INDIVIDUAL CALPERS RETIREES WHOSE PENSION BENEFIT EXCEEDS US DOLLAR LIMIT WOULD BE CAPPED. CALPERS IS RECENT DETERMINED THAT THEY MUST AGGREGATE IT JUST RETIREMENT UNDER GENEROUS AND CHAIRS TO WITH ANY PRIOR STATE SERVICE. THIS NEW INTERPRETATIONS JUDGES WILL BE MORE LIKELY EXCEED THE PENSION INCOME CAP UNDER FEDERAL LAW- FOR EXAMPLE OF RETIRED JUDGE SERVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. PERSONAL TERMS NOW COMBINED WITH THEIR JUDICIAL RETIREMENT PLUS POTENTIALLY CAUSING JUDGES TO HIT OR EXCEED THE FEDERAL BENEFIT LIMIT. FOR OTHER STATE RETIREES AFTER BENEFIT AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE FEDERAL LIMIT THEY MAY LOOK TO HAVE A PLACE TO BENEFIT PLAN REDUCE THEIR AMOUNT JAROCIN HERE TO DO NOT HAVING REPLACEMENT BENEFIT PLAN FOR THEIR JUDICIAL PORTION OF AGGREGATED BENEFITS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THESE TWO ISSUES BY ALLOWING JUDGES TO ACCESS HER PLACE TO BENEFIT PLAN FOR THEIR AGGREGATED JUDICIAL STATE SERVICE PENSIONS AND BY TERRIFYING THAT THE STATE SERVICE PENSION SHOULD BE THE PENSION AMOUNT PRODUCED FIRST. THIS CLARIFICATION ALSO APPLIES TO JUDGES WHO MAY WHO MAY ALSO HAVE A PENSION FOR THE LET'S SEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. WHICH WOULD SURELY BE A DIMINISH NUMBER. BY ALLOWING JUDGES ACCESS TO OUR BIRTHPLACE OF BENEFIT PLAN FOR THEIR STATE SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THEY WERE PROMISED AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR NOT BEING DISADVANTAGED BY ALSO HAVE A JUDICIAL PENSION. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND RECEIVED OPPOSITION. AND HERE AT SESUAI SUPPORTERS MIKE BLOAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE VERY BRIEF MISTER COOLEY OUTLINED THE ISSUE IT'S A TECHNICAL ISSUE CONCERNING THE INTERACTION OFTHE JUDGE'S RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR THE LEGISLATIVE RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR THOSE FEW. PEOPLE STILL PARTICIPATING IN THAT- WHEN YOU HIT THIS FEDERAL LIMIT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN IF YOU SERVED A LONG TIME FOR EXAMPLE AS MR COOLEY SAID IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEN A LONG TIME ON THE BENCH. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE- COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AND A REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT ON THE BILL WE THINK IT'S TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING AND JUST ALLOWS A JUDGE. TO RECIEVE. THE BENEFITS THEY WERE ENTITLED TO UNDER THE PLAN AND WE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BELOW THIS WOULD WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THE ROOM. I NOTICES THE RUMOR SUPPORT THIS BILL.

THE MORNING OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBER AB TWO FOUR ONE WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC AND PLAYERS TO TRANSIT UNIONS OF THEIR INTENTION TO PROCURE FOR DEPLOYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT SERVE UP TRANSIT SERVICES INCLUDING AUTONOMOUS TRANSIT VEHICLES AT LEAST ONE YEAR PRIOR. ADDITIONALLY EMPLOYERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE UNION WITH THE DETAILED ANALYSIS ON WORKER DISPLACEMENT GAPS IN TRAINING AND PLANS TO RETRAIN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. UPON NOTIFICATION THE TRANSIT EMPLOYER BE REQUIRED TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION OVER THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF A TRANSITION OVER RETRAINING PLAN FOR AFFECTED WORKERS TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENT CORPORATE PROHIBIT THE USE OF OR PREVENT A TRANSIT AGENCY FROM EXPLORING AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY. INSTEAD AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE RIGHTLY RECOGNIZES THESE TECHNOLOGIES OFTEN COME WITH IMPACTS ON THE EXISTING WORKFORCE THAT SHOULD BE REVIEWED. WELL TRANSLATE MAYES A CO SAVINGS IN LABOR COSTS THE STATE MUST BE VIGILANT IN ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE WORKFORCE. AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES WE CAN'T FORGET THAT TRANSIT WORKERS ALSO FULFILL NON DRIVING RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH INCREASE TRANS EXCESS ABILITIES PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP RIGHT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MAGNITUDE TRANSIT UNION AND THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS WHO ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE IS A PRETTY SIMPLE BILL IN ESSENCE IT WILL REQUIRE TRANSIT EMPLOYERS TO NOTIFY THE UNION ABOUT THEIR INTENTION TO PROCURE DEPLOY AUTONOMOUS TRANSIT VEHICLES AND THEN MAKE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES A MANDATORY SUBJECT TO BARGAINING. I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE PARTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REACH A DEAL ON IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE BILL DOES REQUIRE THEM TO GET TOGETHER AND DISCUSS ANY SUCH PLANS. THIS BRINGS A MUCH NEEDED AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED WORKER PERSPECTIVE. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE AUTOMATED VEHICLES OPERATORS MECHANICS AND OTHER TRANSIT POLICE HAVE INVALUABLE INSIGHT ON THE INNER WORKINGS OF PUBLIC TRANSIT AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM OUR NEXT WITNESS THE ROLE OF A TRANSIT OPERATOR GOES FAR BEYOND JUST USING A STEERING WHEEL.

COURTEOUS AND TREAT OUR PASSENGERS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. WE PERFORM OUR- WORK ENSURING THAT OUR SAFETY THE SAFETY OF OUR COWORKERS AND THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC OUR OUR PARAMOUNT CONCERN. EACH DAY EACH VEHICLES INSPECTED AND IS A SAFE OPERATING CONDITION BEFORE TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS. WE ASSIST PASSENGERS ON AND OFF THE VEHICLE LIFTS RAMPS ASSIST IN THE USE OF SEATBELTS AND WHEELCHAIR SECUREMENT. WE ESCORT PASSENGERS ALONG ACCESSIBLE PATH OF TRAVEL TO ENTER AND ACCESS TO TRANSIT SYSTEM AND THEIR DESTINATION. WE ALLOW PASSENGERS AMPLE TIME TO BOARD AND EXIT THE VEHICLE. WE INSURE THE A LEVEL BOARDING AREA AND A NARROW GAP BETWEEN THE ACCESS POINT TO THE VEHICLE. DETERMINATE THE WHEELCHAIR LIFTS WERE WORKING PROPERLY AND OPERATE THEM MANUALLY IF NECESSARY. OPERATORS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLE EVACUATIONS OPERATING VEHICLE ALARMS IS NOTHING IF NECESSARY ASSIST WITH STOP ANNOUNCEMENTS AND DE ESCALATE DUTIES BETWEEN DE ESCALATE DISPUTES. BETWEEN PASSENGERS. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE REQUIRES TRANSIT EMPLOYERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNION OVER THE PHASE IN. OR USE OF NEW AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. VEHICLE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN VALUABLE INFORMATION ON HOW PUBLIC TRANSIT WORKS HOW IT SHOULD WORK AND MAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION A SAFE SECURE AND PLEASURABLE RIDING EXPERIENCE.

AGENCIES TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TRIGGER SOME OF THESE PROCESSES- IT COULD LEAD TO YOU KNOW MORE CUMBERSOME- SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT WE MAY CONSIDER TO BE VERY SIMPLE LIKE WE NEED TO GET ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES NEW COMPUTERS IN THEIR OFFICES IN OUR OPINION THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE COVERED BY THE BILL. WE ARE BRINGING ZERO EMISSION BUSES ONLINE THAT MAY NOT OPERATE CURRENTLY ON CERTAIN SYSTEMS AND THAT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE WILL DO DRIVER TRAINING AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE VEHICLES AND ON THE MAINTENANCE SIDE OF IT BUT IT'S NOT I'D WORKER DISPLACEMENT ISSUE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD BUT WE WOULD ASK IS- REALLY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL.

WELL THAT'S NOT A NUMBER ONE- AB TWO ZERO FOUR FIVE MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLASS BY POSITIONS HIRING FLEXIBILITY ACT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO CALIFORNIA LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES HAVE USED THE ROLE OF THREE RANKS TO HIRE CANDIDATES BASED ON DEPLOYMENT EXAMINATION SCORES CLASS BY POSITIONS ARE THOSE THAT DO NOT REQUIRE CREDENTIALS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND CUSTODIAL STAFF BUS DRIVERS AND CAFETERIA STAFF. THE RULE OF THREE RANKS BROWN'S EACH CANDIDATE SCORE FROM THE EXAMINATION PROCESS TO THE NEAREST PERCENTAGE POINT AND THEN RANKS OF SCORES BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT THIS MEANS ONLY THE TOP THREE SCORES ELIGIBLE FOR POTENTIAL EMPLOYMENT LIMITING THE POOL OF CANDIDATES COULD BE CONSIDERED. THE CURRENT SYSTEM. L. SIGNAL IS DEAD AN APPLICANT WHO MAY BE BETTER SUITED OVERALL FOR A PARTICULAR JOB MAY COME FROM A SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND THAT HAS LED THEM TO LESS ADAPT ITS STANDARDIZED TESTS AND AS A RESULT WHICH INADVERTENTLY LOCKED IM OUT OF. FROM A JOB OPPORTUNITY WELL INTENDED BIRD THAT NEPOTISM OR BIAS IN HIRING TO ROUTE THREE RANKS HAS ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES. THE 1% DISTINCTION BETWEEN RANKS IS SO NARROW THAT IT LIMITS THE ABILITY FOR HIRING COMMITTEES TO CONSIDER WELL QUALIFIED OUT APPLICANTS. WHO MAY EXCEL IN OTHER JOB RELATED FACTORS IN SECURE HIGH TEST SCORES BUT DO NOT LAND WITHIN THE TOP THREE RANKS. AS SUCH AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WILL ALLOW L. A. TO OPT INTO A BANDING SYSTEM THAT WOULD INSTEAD GROUP CANDIDATES BY 6% INTERVALS IN INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR HIRING TO FIVE CANDIDATES. IF ENACTED THIS BILL WILL HELP COMBAT THE LACK OF ADEQUATE REPRESENT. HAVE ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION HELP ALLEVIATE STAFF SHORTAGES THAT ARE IMPACTED THAT IMPACT EDUCATION SYSTEM THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS TRUE EDUCATION. EQUITY JOINING ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS UP MICHAEL HENRY WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PERSONNEL COMMISSION LEKO AS WELL AS RANDY PEREZ WITH THE MATTEO COUNTY OFFICE.

COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION INFORMALLY KNOWN AS LAKE ALL. AND AS AN ORGANISATION WE ARE IN TOTAL TOTAL SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THIS LEGISLATION IS LONG OVERDUE AND WILL SERVE TO BENEFIT EMPLOYEES MANAGEMENT AND IT THE ADMINISTRATION. WELL I'M CURRENTLY EIGHT PERSONNEL COMMISSIONER WITH LATE GOAL FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL CENTER AROUND MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH BANDING DOING MY THIRTY TWO YEAR CAREER WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WHERE I SERVED IN A VARIETY OF POSITIONS FROM AN INITIAL INTERNSHIP. TO DEPARTMENT HEAD OF THE COUNTY HUMAN RESOURCE DEPARTMENT I SERVED AS THE CURRENT COUNTY PERSONNEL DIRECTOR FOR ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS AND RETIRED FROM THAT POSITION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES USE BANDING STARTING IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AROUND THE SAME TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED THIS PROCESS AS A MEANS OF MEANS OF GIVING THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE HIRING PROCESS. DURING MY TENURE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOTH EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT AND BRACED THIS PROCESS WHICH CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. HI I PERSONALLY DO I MIGHT THIRTY TWO YEAR CAREER WITH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES PARTICIPATED AS A CANDIDATE IN MANY EXAMS UNDER BANDY AND COMPARED TO THE RULE OF THREE BANDING WAS MORE EFFICIENT AND FAIR- SOME OF THE BENEFITS ARE A LARGER SELECTION WHO OF CANDIDATES TO BE INTERVIEWED- THEN THE RULE OF THREE. LESS RESTRICTIVE IN THE RULE OF THREE. AND OVER TIME IT APPEARS THAT BY A BY PRODUCT OF BANNING IS GREATER DIVERSE CITY. THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE BANDYING AND THEREFORE ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY FEEL IT IS RIGHT FOR THE ORGANIZATION- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE THAT- YOU ALL SUPPORT. BILL. TWENTY FORTY FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NET WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RANDY EREZ I'M I'M I'M WITH THE SAN MATEO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION I THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WITH THE CURRENT STAFFING SHORTAGES SPEAKING PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT THE TIME IS NOW FOR A BILL LIKE AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE ROLE OF THREE RANKS ARTICULATED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LEGISLATION THE TOP DOWN SELECTION MODEL THAT IS ON ONE HAND LIMITING IN A NUMBER OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES CONSIDERED HIGHER AND ON ANOTHER IS PRONE TO HAVE ADVERSE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE AND PROTECT CLASSES. THE UNIFORM GUIDELINES ON EMPLOYEE SELECTION PROCEDURES STRONGLY EMPATHIZED THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYERS SET FOR ADVERSE IMPACT IN THEIR TESTING AND SELECTION PROCEDURES. BUT THE NAY VERY NATURE OF EDUCATION- CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE SECTION FOUR FIVE TWO SEVEN TO. MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PERSONAL COMMISSION OPTED TO MITIGATE ADVERSE IMPACT. WE HAVE THE DATA AND WE CAN SEE WHERE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR ADVERSE IMPACT. BUT THE PRESENT SELECTED JUST THE PROJECT WILL CHALLENGES IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WOULD HELP BRIDGE NOT COMMISSION OPTED. TO MAKE REAL MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN MITIGATING ADVERSE IMPACT. OUR EXAMINATION IS NOT DETERMINISTIC IT'S PROBABLY STICK IN OTHER WORDS ARE DOWN DO NOT FULLY GUARANTEE EMPLOYMENT SUCCESS. THERE IS A PROBABILITY THAT ARE DOWN TO PREDICT EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT SIX SAT BUT TO WHAT DEGREE THAT DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS. THE SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PASSPORT MAY NOT MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES IN EXPECTED JOB PERFORMANCE. WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT CONTROL FOR ERROR AND OUR QUALIFICATION PROCESS. IT BANJA METHOD THAT THAT LIKE THAT ARTICULATED IN AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WOULD GIVE IT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL PRAYER. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO MOVE TO THE SELECTION PROCESS. AND A GREATER NUMBER OF CANDIDATES WOULD INEVITABLY ALLOW FOR A MORE DIVERSIFIED AND INCLUSIVE CANDIDATE POOL FOR HIGHER.
