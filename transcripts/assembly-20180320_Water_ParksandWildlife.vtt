AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION AND I

00:58:48.592 --> 00:58:51.928 region:rollup2
THINK THINK THE AUTHOR I'M. FOR

00:58:50.594 --> 00:58:53.230 region:rollup2
FOR WORKING WITH ME THIS I THINK

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:55.465 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL.

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:56.933 region:rollup2
TO HAVE BEEN AND I I THINK

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:58.435 region:rollup2
ADDING IN THE THE PROVISIONS.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:59:00.170 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOW THE VOTERS TO TRIGGER

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:01.872 region:rollup2
A VOTE IF IF ENOUGH PEOPLE

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:03.039 region:rollup2
PROTEST THE DECISION YOU MAKE

00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:04.408 region:rollup2
PUTS US MORE IN LINE WITH

PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN AND

00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:06.076 region:rollup2
HELPS PROTECT.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:08.445 region:rollup2
AND THE INTEREST OF TAXPAYERS

00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:10.046 region:rollup2
ON.

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:12.015 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO I MEAN THAT I THINK

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:13.483 region:rollup2
THAT THE LARGER ISSUE IS IT IS

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:14.985 region:rollup2
AS MADAME MAYOR YOU POINTED OUT.

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:16.219 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:17.454 region:rollup2
HAVE I COME AT A LOCAL

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:20.090 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT MYSELF.

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:21.992 region:rollup2
AS I KNOW AND AS THE AUTHOR.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.393 region:rollup2
AND HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS AND

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
SIMILAR SITUATION.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:26.863 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:28.432 region:rollup2
HAD A VERY SMALL. SYSTEM THEY

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:31.001 region:rollup2
SEE HUNDRED USERS IN A VERY

00:59:28.432 --> 00:59:33.437 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITY. AND.

00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:34.738 region:rollup2
WITH REALLY NO OTHER OPTIONS

00:59:33.437 --> 00:59:36.440 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN TO RAISE RATES AT

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:37.407 region:rollup2
SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.876 region:rollup2
.

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:42.679 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY TO DO THAT

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:44.214 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP TIED TO DO AND.

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:45.849 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.

00:59:44.214 --> 00:59:47.551 region:rollup2
AND REALLY IF THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:59:45.849 --> 00:59:49.920 region:rollup2
MERGE WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM.

00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:51.354 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES OF SCALE THERE FOR

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.989 region:rollup2
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:54.224 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.958 region:rollup2
JUST MADE A LOT OF SENSE AND SO

00:59:54.224 --> 00:59:56.293 region:rollup2
HAVING THIS TOOL OUT THERE I

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:58.695 region:rollup2
THINK IS.

00:59:56.293 --> 01:00:00.097 region:rollup2
UNIT AND IS VERY MUCH NEEDED AND

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.664 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF SYSTEMS

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.798 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALLY JUST KINDA

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:04.201 region:rollup2
STRANDED.

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:05.902 region:rollup2
ON THEIR OWN AND. YOU KNOW WITH

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.637 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:09.239 region:rollup2
WITH THAT SYSTEM IN PLACE RIGHT

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.407 region:rollup2
NOW REALLY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO IT

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.208 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN TO RAISE RATES VARY

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.009 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.010 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:15.612 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.179 region:rollup2

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.181 region:rollup2

TODAY.

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:42.601 region:rollup2
TWO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

02:10:40.466 --> 02:10:44.036 region:rollup2
STORAGE FUNDING THREE AND

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:46.072 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:47.540 region:rollup2
IT'S ON COULD PROCESS STEPS THAT

02:10:46.072 --> 02:10:49.508 region:rollup2
WE WOULD SUGGEST.

02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:50.476 region:rollup2
AND FOURTH A LINK TO FEDERAL

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:52.445 region:rollup2
FUNDING WHICH IS GOOD TO HAVE IN

02:10:50.476 --> 02:10:54.980 region:rollup2
MIND.

02:10:52.445 --> 02:10:56.315 region:rollup2
SO ON THOUGH HISTORY ON PROP ONE

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:59.485 region:rollup2
IN MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS FIRST

02:10:56.315 --> 02:11:01.520 region:rollup2
HAND. BY PROP ONE WASN'T WRITTEN

02:10:59.485 --> 02:11:03.589 region:rollup2
IN. ALL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.158 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO THE PACKAGE FROM

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:08.861 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND NINE. THAT BILL ON

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:10.730 region:rollup2
IT WAS BY A SENATOR COG DEAL AND

02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:12.932 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ELEVEN POINT ONE FOUR

02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:14.400 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BOND. THAT

02:11:12.932 --> 02:11:16.102 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED.

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.703 region:rollup2
AND AFTER TWO THOUSAND NINE WE

02:11:16.102 --> 02:11:19.905 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE RECESSION IN THERE

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:21.407 region:rollup2
WERE DECISIONS MADE BY I THINK A

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:22.608 region:rollup2
LOT OF FOLKS THAT.

02:11:21.407 --> 02:11:25.211 region:rollup2
VOTE ON THE BOND SHOULD BE

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:27.546 region:rollup2
DELAYED AND SO IT WAS DELAYED

02:11:25.211 --> 02:11:29.648 region:rollup2
UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THERE

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:32.051 region:rollup2
WAS A LOT OF WORK ON BOTH SIDES

02:11:29.648 --> 02:11:33.719 region:rollup2
OF THE AISLE. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:11:32.051 --> 02:11:35.287 region:rollup2
TO TRIM THE BOND DOWN FROM AT

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:37.556 region:rollup2
ELEVEN POINT ONE FOUR BILLION

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:40.092 region:rollup2
DOLLAR BOND TO THE SEVEN POINT

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:41.827 region:rollup2
FIVE OR SO BILLION DOLLAR BOND.

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:43.229 region:rollup2
THAT WENT TO THE VOTERS.

02:11:41.827 --> 02:11:44.730 region:rollup2
SOTHAT YOUR AND I THINK IT'S

02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:47.199 region:rollup2
WORTH NOTING THE ASSEMBLY VOTED

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:49.034 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SEVEN TWO TWO.

02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:51.337 region:rollup2
AND ON THE SENATE VOTED THIRTY

02:11:49.034 --> 02:11:53.172 region:rollup2
SEVEN TO ZERO GOVERNOR BROWN

02:11:51.337 --> 02:11:55.174 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY SIGN THE BILL FOR US

02:11:53.172 --> 02:11:55.775 region:rollup2
THAT WITH A VERY EXCITING DAY WE

02:11:55.174 --> 02:11:56.976 region:rollup2
HAVE A PICTURE ABOUT UP IN THE

02:11:55.775 --> 02:11:59.078 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

02:11:56.976 --> 02:12:00.413 region:rollup2
IN IN IN THE OF COURSE THE KEY

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:02.414 region:rollup2
EVENT IS THAT IT WENT TO THE

02:12:00.413 --> 02:12:04.483 region:rollup2
VOTERS AS PROP ONE IN THE PAST

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:06.919 region:rollup2
BY SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. I GO

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:08.154 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT JUST TO SAY THAT

02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:09.588 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ACTOR.

02:12:08.154 --> 02:12:12.525 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR ACTED THE VOTERS

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:13.893 region:rollup2
ACTED IN THE EXPECTATION IS THAT

02:12:12.525 --> 02:12:15.561 region:rollup2
THE MONEY WHEN YOU PASS A BOND

02:12:13.893 --> 02:12:17.163 region:rollup2
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE

02:12:15.561 --> 02:12:18.597 region:rollup2
MONEY WILL BE ALLOCATED AND SO

02:12:17.163 --> 02:12:20.766 region:rollup2
WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT. VERY

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:23.035 region:rollup2
POSITIVE STATEMENTS OF THE THE

02:12:20.766 --> 02:12:25.271 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS THIS MORNING.

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:27.406 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE HISTORY.

02:12:25.271 --> 02:12:30.476 region:rollup2
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE.

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:32.711 region:rollup2
PROF WHEN STORAGE MONEY. UP THE

02:12:30.476 --> 02:12:35.080 region:rollup2
CHAPTER EIGHT LANGUAGE FOCUSES A

02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:36.816 region:rollup2
LOT ON PUBLIC BENEFITS IN IN

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:38.617 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

02:12:36.816 --> 02:12:40.386 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS ARE IT

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:42.621 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS.

02:12:40.386 --> 02:12:44.824 region:rollup2
AND WHY IS THAT.

02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:46.792 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT STORAGE

02:12:44.824 --> 02:12:49.261 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FROM A WATER

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:51.397 region:rollup2
SUPPLY MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT AND

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:54.166 region:rollup2
FLOOD PROTECTION. THAT'S STILL

02:12:51.397 --> 02:12:55.234 region:rollup2
VERY TRUE TODAY BUT WHAT'S ALSO

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:57.436 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE

02:12:55.234 --> 02:13:00.105 region:rollup2
STORAGE TO HELP PROVIDE WATER

02:12:57.436 --> 02:13:01.307 region:rollup2
FOR THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:02.675 region:rollup2
SUCH AS SENSUAL SEASONAL FISH

02:13:01.307 --> 02:13:04.343 region:rollup2
FLOWS.

02:13:02.675 --> 02:13:05.811 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANTED TO

02:13:04.343 --> 02:13:07.813 region:rollup2
MENTION IN CHAIR QUINN PARA

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:09.114 region:rollup2
ALREADY MENTIONED THE PUBLIC

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.515 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT ARE IN THE LOT SO

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:11.617 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GOING TO.

02:13:09.515 --> 02:13:13.152 region:rollup2
KEEP THAT.

02:13:11.617 --> 02:13:15.187 region:rollup2
SO NOW I COME TO THE PROCESS AT

02:13:13.152 --> 02:13:17.256 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION.

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:18.924 region:rollup2
AND I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

02:13:17.256 --> 02:13:20.292 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PRE APPEAL

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:22.995 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS CAME OUT FOR THE

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:24.463 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS.

02:13:22.995 --> 02:13:25.865 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN AND

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:27.499 region:rollup2
AQUA WE WERE VERY CONCERNED

02:13:25.865 --> 02:13:28.534 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:30.402 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE

02:13:28.534 --> 02:13:31.904 region:rollup2
A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:33.706 region:rollup2
REVIEWERS AT THE STATE AND THE

02:13:31.904 --> 02:13:36.475 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS.

02:13:33.706 --> 02:13:38.811 region:rollup2
AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:40.079 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION HELD ADDITIONAL

02:13:38.811 --> 02:13:41.647 region:rollup2
MEETINGS THEY WERE.

02:13:40.079 --> 02:13:42.748 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WITH THE

02:13:41.647 --> 02:13:45.117 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS BUT THEY WERE

02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:46.719 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT IT WAS ARE EXCELLENT

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:49.255 region:rollup2
PROCESS STEP WHETHER WE WITH

02:13:46.719 --> 02:13:50.789 region:rollup2
FURTHER COMMUNICATION TO INFORM

02:13:49.255 --> 02:13:53.225 region:rollup2
THE APPEAL PROCESS

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:55.694 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT WAS CRITICAL.

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:57.897 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT SIMILAR FUTURE

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:59.331 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT I

02:13:57.897 --> 02:14:00.833 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT WE THINK

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:02.534 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

02:14:00.833 --> 02:14:04.236 region:rollup2
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:06.605 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BUT FOR THE KEY

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:08.073 region:rollup2
MILESTONES THAT ARE COMING UP

02:14:06.605 --> 02:14:09.942 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN INFORM THE

02:14:08.073 --> 02:14:12.211 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO THAT IF STATE

02:14:09.942 --> 02:14:12.878 region:rollup2
REVIEWERS HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:14.313 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SUBMITTED THEY CAN ASK A

02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:16.382 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:14:14.313 --> 02:14:18.050 region:rollup2
THIS IS A A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:14:16.382 --> 02:14:19.752 region:rollup2
IT'S OF IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN

02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:21.220 region:rollup2
OUR STORAGE THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:14:19.752 --> 02:14:23.789 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE A DISCUSSION BACK AND

02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:25.724 region:rollup2
FORTH. AND AGAIN WE SUGGEST THAT

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:28.694 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL PROCESS STEPS BE

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:31.564 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE KEY MILESTONES.

02:14:28.694 --> 02:14:33.766 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE THE THIRD POINT.

02:14:31.564 --> 02:14:35.568 region:rollup2
IN AN THE FOURTH POINT IS ON A

02:14:33.766 --> 02:14:36.669 region:rollup2
COMMON ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING.

02:14:35.568 --> 02:14:38.537 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE MAY ALREADY BE

02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:39.772 region:rollup2
AWARE BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:41.740 region:rollup2
SURE THE COMMITTEE AND THE

02:14:39.772 --> 02:14:43.509 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ARE AWARE. THAT.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.044 region:rollup2
CONGRESS ACTUALLY GOT IT

02:14:43.509 --> 02:14:47.713 region:rollup2
TOGETHER NOT TOO LONG AGO AND

02:14:45.044 --> 02:14:50.449 region:rollup2
PASSED A. NEW LAW ON WATER IT'S

02:14:47.713 --> 02:14:50.449 region:rollup2
CALLED THE WIN ACT.

02:14:50.516 --> 02:14:54.019 region:rollup2
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:55.754 region:rollup2
FOR THE NATION'S ACT.

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:57.523 region:rollup2
AND THAT INCLUDES MONEY FOR

02:14:55.754 --> 02:15:00.159 region:rollup2
STORAGE.

02:14:57.523 --> 02:15:02.728 region:rollup2
AND ON THE KEY IS THAT FOR

02:15:00.159 --> 02:15:05.097 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PROJECTS IT SPELLS

02:15:02.728 --> 02:15:06.398 region:rollup2
OUT THAT THEY HAVE TO.

02:15:05.097 --> 02:15:07.566 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THE OUT BY AND I THINK

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:09.401 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY HAS TO

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:10.769 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THAT THEY MEET THE

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:12.671 region:rollup2
PROP ONE TESS.

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:13.739 region:rollup2
SO FUND THIS YEAR ARE

02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:15.107 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE BUDGET PROCESS

02:15:13.739 --> 02:15:16.775 region:rollup2
IS

02:15:15.107 --> 02:15:19.244 region:rollup2
THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR WILL

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:21.280 region:rollup2
ACT WILL BE DOING EVALUATIONS.

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:22.348 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL PROVIDE THEIR

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.849 region:rollup2
INPUT TO CONGRESS ON THIS IN

02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:25.451 region:rollup2
AUGUST

02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:27.419 region:rollup2
SO THE TIMING TO GET THESE

02:15:25.451 --> 02:15:29.722 region:rollup2
DECISIONS. ARE ALLOCATION

02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:31.690 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ON DONE THE SUMMER IS

02:15:29.722 --> 02:15:33.359 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK THAT

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:35.160 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:36.628 region:rollup2
OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY.

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.464 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I REALLY

02:15:36.628 --> 02:15:40.132 region:rollup2

WESTERN WATER PROGRAM.

02:16:00.386 --> 02:16:03.155 region:rollup2
AND OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON

02:16:01.487 --> 02:16:04.890 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT OUR WATER

02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:06.191 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS RESILIENT TO MEET OUR

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:07.659 region:rollup2
CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR SOCIETY

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:08.594 region:rollup2
AND NATURE.

02:16:07.659 --> 02:16:10.029 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF

02:16:08.594 --> 02:16:12.164 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE AND MORE EXTREME

02:16:10.029 --> 02:16:13.766 region:rollup2
WEATHER CONDITIONS.

02:16:12.164 --> 02:16:15.367 region:rollup2
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I'M WATER

02:16:13.766 --> 02:16:16.435 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ENGINEER HYDROLOGIST

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:17.870 region:rollup2
IN A LAWSUIT LICENSED

02:16:16.435 --> 02:16:19.304 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL OF CIVIL

02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:20.706 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING CALIFORNIA.

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:22.341 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS

02:16:20.706 --> 02:16:23.976 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA WATER FOR

02:16:22.341 --> 02:16:26.045 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND.

02:16:23.976 --> 02:16:28.547 region:rollup2
AND WORKED IN OTHER ISSUES AND

02:16:26.045 --> 02:16:30.416 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES BEFORE THAT.

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:32.618 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER WELL THE NEGOTIATION

02:16:30.416 --> 02:16:33.218 region:rollup2
DROUGHT POP ONE HAS MISTOOK IS.

02:16:32.618 --> 02:16:35.821 region:rollup2
AND.

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:37.056 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED IT WAS A LONG DELIVER

02:16:35.821 --> 02:16:39.792 region:rollup2
TO PROCESS.

02:16:37.056 --> 02:16:41.226 region:rollup2
THAT LED. TO EVENTUALLY THE

02:16:39.792 --> 02:16:42.261 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF TWO POINT SEVEN

02:16:41.226 --> 02:16:43.495 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR

02:16:42.261 --> 02:16:45.097 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFITS.

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:45.931 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE WITH WATER STORAGE

02:16:45.097 --> 02:16:47.733 region:rollup2
PROJECTS AND IN CHAPTER EIGHT

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:49.868 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE.

02:16:47.733 --> 02:16:50.769 region:rollup2
IN AT THAT TIME A WIDE RANGE OF

02:16:49.868 --> 02:16:52.171 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:54.573 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:16:52.171 --> 02:16:55.841 region:rollup2
WE NEED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:57.609 region:rollup2
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:16:55.841 --> 02:16:59.344 region:rollup2
AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT.

02:16:57.609 --> 02:17:00.045 region:rollup2
DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S INTENSE

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:02.748 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR WATER

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:04.283 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY

02:17:02.748 --> 02:17:06.251 region:rollup2
AND OUR FUTURE AND OUR WAY OF

02:17:04.283 --> 02:17:08.187 region:rollup2
OUR FARMS AND OUR WAY OF LIFE.

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:09.688 region:rollup2
AND THE NEED FOR INVESTMENT HAS

02:17:08.187 --> 02:17:11.757 region:rollup2
EVEN INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:13.459 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE EXPERIENCED SEVERE

02:17:11.757 --> 02:17:14.827 region:rollup2
DROUGHTS AND FLOODS INCLUDING.

02:17:13.459 --> 02:17:16.628 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TIME WE FIRST

02:17:14.827 --> 02:17:18.430 region:rollup2
STARTED TALKING ABOUT A BOND AND

02:17:16.628 --> 02:17:20.099 region:rollup2
THE TIME IT WAS EVENTUALLY I GOT

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:21.600 region:rollup2
TO THE VOTERS.

02:17:20.099 --> 02:17:23.635 region:rollup2
TWO OF OUR MOST SEVERE DROUGHTS

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.937 region:rollup2
ON RECORD OCCUR.

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:26.105 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IN

02:17:24.937 --> 02:17:26.872 region:rollup2
OUR HISTORY DEALING WITH

02:17:26.105 --> 02:17:28.707 region:rollup2
DROUGHTS IT WAS CLEARED UP

02:17:26.872 --> 02:17:30.042 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS AND AS I SAID A

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:32.077 region:rollup2
WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS

02:17:30.042 --> 02:17:34.613 region:rollup2
WORKING ON PROPOSITION ONE THAT.

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:36.014 region:rollup2
MORE WATER STORAGE IS NEEDED.

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.181 region:rollup2
FIRST MAJOR POINT I WANT TO MAKE

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:36.715 region:rollup2
IS.

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:38.550 region:rollup2
.

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:40.786 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:41.420 region:rollup2
THIS IS A NEW VENTURE THAT WE

02:17:40.786 --> 02:17:42.821 region:rollup2
ARE ON.

02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:44.656 region:rollup2
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:46.291 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE NATURE.

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:47.593 region:rollup2
OF WHAT SOME OF YOU AND YOUR

02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:49.495 region:rollup2
PREDECESSORS DID IN TWENTY

02:17:47.593 --> 02:17:51.096 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:17:49.495 --> 02:17:52.131 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH IN NOW.

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:53.899 region:rollup2
THIS WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT

02:17:52.131 --> 02:17:55.434 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE

02:17:53.899 --> 02:17:55.934 region:rollup2
WAY WE HAVE APPROACHED WATER

02:17:55.434 --> 02:17:59.538 region:rollup2
STORAGE FOR MOST. OF OUR

02:17:55.934 --> 02:18:00.706 region:rollup2
HISTORY.

02:17:59.538 --> 02:18:02.674 region:rollup2
IN MOST OUR HISTORY ARE WATER

02:18:00.706 --> 02:18:04.977 region:rollup2
STORAGES BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:06.445 region:rollup2
THREE BASIC NEEDS THE FEW OTHERS

02:18:04.977 --> 02:18:07.980 region:rollup2
AROUND THE EDGES BUT PRIMARILY

02:18:06.445 --> 02:18:10.482 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL WATER SUPPLY.

02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:11.917 region:rollup2
AND HYDROPOWER GENERATION.

02:18:10.482 --> 02:18:13.752 region:rollup2
AND THEN ONLY AFTER PROJECTS

02:18:11.917 --> 02:18:14.353 region:rollup2
WERE BUILT LARGELY FOR THOSE

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:15.053 region:rollup2
PROCESSES THE FOR THOSE WHO.

02:18:14.353 --> 02:18:17.456 region:rollup2
.

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:18.257 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:18:17.456 --> 02:18:19.758 region:rollup2
WE TRIED TO CONSTRAIN THE

02:18:18.257 --> 02:18:21.193 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:22.828 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST HOW WE OPERATED IT

02:18:21.193 --> 02:18:24.596 region:rollup2
CETERA TO IMPROVE THINGS LIKE

02:18:22.828 --> 02:18:25.697 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:27.499 region:rollup2
MITIGATE FOREIGN BAR.

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:29.067 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IMPACT

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:29.935 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT WHILE I.

02:18:29.067 --> 02:18:31.336 region:rollup2
STILL A MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE

02:18:29.935 --> 02:18:32.671 region:rollup2
RESERVOIRS.

02:18:31.336 --> 02:18:33.639 region:rollup2
AND THE STORAGE HAS BEEN FOR

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:35.941 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL WATER STORAGE IN A

02:18:33.639 --> 02:18:38.343 region:rollup2
POWER GENERATION.

02:18:35.941 --> 02:18:39.912 region:rollup2
IN CONTRAST THIS PROGRAM TURNS

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:41.547 region:rollup2
THAT A LITTLE BIT ON ITS HEAD

02:18:39.912 --> 02:18:43.148 region:rollup2
AND SAYS THAT WE WILL

02:18:41.547 --> 02:18:45.050 region:rollup2
PROACTIVELY.

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:46.752 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE STORAGE

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:48.253 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE WATER BENEFITS.

02:18:46.752 --> 02:18:49.054 region:rollup2
FOR THE PUBLIC INCLUDING THE

02:18:48.253 --> 02:18:49.755 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOSYSTEM

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:52.457 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS

02:18:49.755 --> 02:18:53.992 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED IN THE ACT.

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:56.361 region:rollup2
THE KEY PART OF THIS OF COURSE

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:57.763 region:rollup2
IS THE PRO ACTIVE. ASPECT OF IT

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.797 region:rollup2
DELIBERATELY PUTTING THE STORAGE

02:18:57.763 --> 02:19:01.066 region:rollup2
TO USE.

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:02.634 region:rollup2
TO ME.

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:04.036 region:rollup2
PACIFIC PUBLIC NEEDS INCLUDING

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:05.504 region:rollup2
AS DESCRIBED IN THE LAW AND

02:19:04.036 --> 02:19:07.439 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED

02:19:05.504 --> 02:19:08.907 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS.

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:10.776 region:rollup2
WATER QUALITY PRINTS IN THE

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:12.878 region:rollup2
DELTA FLOOD CONTROL.

02:19:10.776 --> 02:19:14.713 region:rollup2
EMERGED RESPONSE AND RECREATION.

02:19:12.878 --> 02:19:17.516 region:rollup2
THIS NEW AND AND I ACTUALLY

02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:19.084 region:rollup2
THINK THE VISIONARY STEP.

02:19:17.516 --> 02:19:22.187 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT STORAGE PRESENT SOME

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:23.855 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE.

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:25.090 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LONG LEGACY OF

02:19:23.855 --> 02:19:27.492 region:rollup2
PROCESSES AND STANDARD

02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:28.894 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES FOR.

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:30.462 region:rollup2
DEVELOPER MARMI CORBIN HERE'S

02:19:28.894 --> 02:19:31.863 region:rollup2
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND OTHERS

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:34.233 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD TO BUILD

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:35.767 region:rollup2
STORAGE DRUGS FOR WATER SUPPLY

02:19:34.233 --> 02:19:37.936 region:rollup2
AND POWER GENERATION BUT.

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:39.338 region:rollup2
FOR ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS AND OTHER

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:40.606 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFITS AS PRESCRIBED IN

02:19:39.338 --> 02:19:42.474 region:rollup2
THE LAW.

02:19:40.606 --> 02:19:44.376 region:rollup2
THE ESTABLISHED PRACTICE IS NOT

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:45.611 region:rollup2
SO CLEAR.

02:19:44.376 --> 02:19:47.813 region:rollup2
NO WE'RE NOT COMPLETE STARTING

02:19:45.611 --> 02:19:48.113 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY FROM SCRATCH BUT WE

02:19:47.813 --> 02:19:49.248 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE.

02:19:48.113 --> 02:19:51.717 region:rollup2
.

02:19:49.248 --> 02:19:53.352 region:rollup2
THAT IS WELL ESTABLISHED WAYS OF

02:19:51.717 --> 02:19:55.053 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZING HOW THE PROJECT

02:19:53.352 --> 02:19:56.421 region:rollup2
STORAGE PROJECTS CAN BE OPERATED

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:57.723 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS.

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:58.190 region:rollup2
QUANTIFYING THOSE BENEFITS

02:19:57.723 --> 02:20:00.692 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING THEM AND

02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:02.394 region:rollup2
MONETIZING.

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:03.462 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS THE WATER COMMISSION

02:20:02.394 --> 02:20:05.130 region:rollup2
AND THEIR STAFF OF HAD TO BREAK

02:20:03.462 --> 02:20:07.466 region:rollup2
NEW GROUND.

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:09.935 region:rollup2
LOTS OF NEW GROUND IN FACT.

02:20:07.466 --> 02:20:11.637 region:rollup2
AND BY CRITIQUING THE PROJECTS.

02:20:09.935 --> 02:20:12.704 region:rollup2
AND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY

02:20:11.637 --> 02:20:15.274 region:rollup2
THE PROPONENTS THEY'RE DOING

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:16.408 region:rollup2
THEIR JOB.

02:20:15.274 --> 02:20:17.976 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT'S

02:20:16.408 --> 02:20:19.945 region:rollup2
TAKEN AWHILE. AND IT'S NOT

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:20.712 region:rollup2
SURPRISING THAT IT HASN'T GONE

02:20:19.945 --> 02:20:22.781 region:rollup2
ALL THAT SMOOTHLY AND THAT THERE

02:20:20.712 --> 02:20:23.582 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SOME HICCUPS.

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:24.483 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IT'S BEEN

02:20:23.582 --> 02:20:26.018 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING FOR THE WATER

02:20:24.483 --> 02:20:27.586 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THEIR STAFF.

02:20:26.018 --> 02:20:30.689 region:rollup2
AND ADMITTEDLY FOR THE PROJECT

02:20:27.586 --> 02:20:32.658 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS.

02:20:30.689 --> 02:20:34.259 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY WE ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:20:32.658 --> 02:20:35.661 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY OUR OUR

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.962 region:rollup2
BIT NERVOUS.

02:20:35.661 --> 02:20:38.931 region:rollup2
I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING

02:20:36.962 --> 02:20:40.365 region:rollup2
STORAGE.

02:20:38.931 --> 02:20:42.267 region:rollup2
CAN BE OPERATED PROACTIVELY FOR

02:20:40.365 --> 02:20:43.101 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFITS.

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:45.070 region:rollup2
OCCLUDING ANVAR ECOSYSTEM

02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:48.206 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS.

02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:49.574 region:rollup2
IS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL TOOL.

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:51.209 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK MOST OF US ARE

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:53.078 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT NERVOUS THAT. IF IT

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:54.379 region:rollup2
ISN'T DONE RIGHT WE COULD END UP

02:20:53.078 --> 02:20:55.747 region:rollup2
WITH AN EVEN WORST WITH EVEN

02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:57.549 region:rollup2
WORSE CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:59.284 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE TO DEPEND ON OUR WHAT

02:20:57.549 --> 02:21:01.420 region:rollup2
RIVERS AND STREAMS AND WETLANDS.

02:20:59.284 --> 02:21:02.754 region:rollup2
AND OUR INNOVATIVE TWO POINT

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:04.456 region:rollup2
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:06.658 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS.

02:21:04.456 --> 02:21:08.193 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE GONE FOR NOW.

02:21:06.658 --> 02:21:10.429 region:rollup2
AND SET A POOR PRECEDENT.

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:11.997 region:rollup2
FOR THIS

02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:13.231 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY VISIONARY A

02:21:11.997 --> 02:21:15.734 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIVE WAVE USING

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:16.635 region:rollup2
STORAGE.

02:21:15.734 --> 02:21:18.103 region:rollup2
NOW FOR THOSE WHO ARE MORE

02:21:16.635 --> 02:21:19.871 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE WATER SUPPLY

02:21:18.103 --> 02:21:21.440 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF NEW STORAGE.

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:23.475 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE HAVE LESS.

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.177 region:rollup2
LESS INTEREST ARE LESS FOCUSED

02:21:23.475 --> 02:21:26.878 region:rollup2
ON THE PUBLIC BENEFITS.

02:21:25.177 --> 02:21:28.547 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK THOSE INTEREST

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:30.449 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING

02:21:28.547 --> 02:21:31.950 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS DONE RIGHT.

02:21:30.449 --> 02:21:34.186 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS

02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:35.654 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE QUEST.

02:21:34.186 --> 02:21:36.488 region:rollup2
IF THE WATER MADE AVAILABLE FOR%

02:21:35.654 --> 02:21:38.156 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFITS CAN REALLY

02:21:36.488 --> 02:21:39.157 region:rollup2
DELIVER.

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:40.225 region:rollup2
AND HELP RESTORE THE AQUATIC

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:42.127 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEMS OF THE BAY DELTA

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:45.163 region:rollup2
WATERSHED.

02:21:42.127 --> 02:21:49.501 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL REDUCE CONFLICT.

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:50.802 region:rollup2
AND THE WATER USERS WIN AS WELL.

02:21:49.501 --> 02:21:52.738 region:rollup2
A MORE RESILIENT WATER SYSTEM

02:21:50.802 --> 02:21:54.039 region:rollup2
AND ADAPT WATER SYSTEM MEANS

02:21:52.738 --> 02:21:57.509 region:rollup2
THAT OUR WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM

02:21:54.039 --> 02:21:59.444 region:rollup2
WORKS BETTER FOR ALL OF US.

02:21:57.509 --> 02:22:01.480 region:rollup2
SECOND POINT ONE MAKE IS THAT AS

02:21:59.444 --> 02:22:03.048 region:rollup2
AS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. BY OTHER

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:03.849 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS IN INCLUDING A

02:22:03.048 --> 02:22:05.817 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER CAN TARA.

02:22:03.849 --> 02:22:08.453 region:rollup2
.

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:09.388 region:rollup2
VICTOR WITH THE.

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:10.956 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE TAPPED RATE HASN'T

02:22:09.388 --> 02:22:12.691 region:rollup2
NEW AND INVENTIVE INNOVATIVE

02:22:10.956 --> 02:22:13.625 region:rollup2
APPROACH WATER STORAGE.

02:22:12.691 --> 02:22:15.193 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE PROJECT

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:16.328 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SELECTED BY THE

02:22:15.193 --> 02:22:17.462 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THROUGH COMPETITIVE

02:22:16.328 --> 02:22:19.464 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROCESS.

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:21.733 region:rollup2
AND.

02:22:19.464 --> 02:22:22.968 region:rollup2
AS DESCRIBED EARLIER THE CHAPTER

02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:26.738 region:rollup2
I DO NOT GUARANTEE EARMARKED.

02:22:22.968 --> 02:22:28.173 region:rollup2
FOR ANY SPECIFIC PROJECT.

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:30.308 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK IT WAS A WISE

02:22:28.173 --> 02:22:31.443 region:rollup2
DECISION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:32.878 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE VOTERS IN

02:22:31.443 --> 02:22:34.079 region:rollup2
APPROVING IT THAT. THAT ALLOWS

02:22:32.878 --> 02:22:35.380 region:rollup2
FOR THE BEST PROJECTS TO MOVE

02:22:34.079 --> 02:22:36.481 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:38.350 region:rollup2
AND INDEED SEVERAL OF THE

02:22:36.481 --> 02:22:40.152 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT AM COMPETING FOR

02:22:38.350 --> 02:22:40.819 region:rollup2
FUNDING CAN MAKE.

02:22:40.152 --> 02:22:42.354 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO

02:22:40.819 --> 02:22:43.855 region:rollup2
ADDRESS

02:22:42.354 --> 02:22:45.924 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S WATER STORAGE NEEDS

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:47.225 region:rollup2
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.759 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THERE IS ENOUGH

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:48.927 region:rollup2
MONEY TO FUND ALL OF THESE

02:22:47.759 --> 02:22:50.529 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:52.297 region:rollup2
AND SO IT IS ONLY SENSIBLE.

02:22:50.529 --> 02:22:53.632 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE PROJECTS

02:22:52.297 --> 02:22:54.166 region:rollup2
WITH THE MOST PROMISE FOR PUBLIC

02:22:53.632 --> 02:22:56.268 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ARE SELECTED FOR

02:22:54.166 --> 02:22:57.102 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:22:56.268 --> 02:22:58.703 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMEROUS VERY

02:22:57.102 --> 02:23:00.238 region:rollup2
PROMISING PROJECT PROPOSED HOME

02:22:58.703 --> 02:23:00.806 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED WITH SOME

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:01.940 region:rollup2
OF THE INVADING GROUND WATER

02:23:00.806 --> 02:23:02.808 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:05.310 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHICH PROVIDE

02:23:02.808 --> 02:23:07.212 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN PLACE.

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:08.680 region:rollup2
AND ALSO INCREASE WATER SUPPLY

02:23:07.212 --> 02:23:10.248 region:rollup2
BUTA FOR HUMAN USES DURING

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:11.383 region:rollup2
DROUGHT YEARS.

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:13.118 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE GROUNDWATER

02:23:11.383 --> 02:23:14.986 region:rollup2
PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK IN

02:23:13.118 --> 02:23:16.655 region:rollup2
CONCERT WITH EXISTING.

02:23:14.986 --> 02:23:18.223 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIALLY FUTURE SERVICE

02:23:16.655 --> 02:23:20.625 region:rollup2
TOWARDS RESOURCED TO INCREASE

02:23:18.223 --> 02:23:22.260 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY RELEASE RESILIENCY.

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:28.333 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE DIRECT PUBLIC

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:29.835 region:rollup2
BENEFITS FOR PATIENT WHILE.

02:23:28.333 --> 02:23:31.570 region:rollup2
IN FACT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

02:23:29.835 --> 02:23:32.838 region:rollup2
POWERFUL PROMISES OF THE WATER

02:23:31.570 --> 02:23:34.573 region:rollup2
SYSTEM STORAGE INVESTMENT

02:23:32.838 --> 02:23:35.507 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:23:34.573 --> 02:23:36.875 region:rollup2
OPERATING A COMBINATION OF NEW

02:23:35.507 --> 02:23:39.044 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:23:36.875 --> 02:23:40.278 region:rollup2
IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

02:23:39.044 --> 02:23:41.947 region:rollup2
AND CONCERT WITH EXISTING

02:23:40.278 --> 02:23:42.814 region:rollup2
STORAGE PROJECTS GROUNDWATER AND

02:23:41.947 --> 02:23:44.616 region:rollup2
SURFACE WATER TO MULTIPLY THE

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:45.584 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:23:44.616 --> 02:23:47.919 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE

02:23:45.584 --> 02:23:49.287 region:rollup2
WITHIN A SINGLE PROJECT.

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:50.288 region:rollup2
I HOPE THE COMMISSION CAN

02:23:49.287 --> 02:23:52.324 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE CONSIDERATION OF

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:54.426 region:rollup2
THESE SYNERGISTIC BENEFITS IN

02:23:52.324 --> 02:23:55.193 region:rollup2
THEIR EVALUATIONS TO ENSURE THE

02:23:54.426 --> 02:23:56.995 region:rollup2
SELECTION OF A PORTFOLIO OF

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.596 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:23:56.995 --> 02:24:00.999 region:rollup2
THAT MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO

02:23:57.596 --> 02:24:02.767 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC.

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:04.603 region:rollup2
A THIRD POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:06.238 region:rollup2
IS MORE PROCEDURAL AND REFLECTS

02:24:04.603 --> 02:24:07.639 region:rollup2
OF WHAT. WHAT DONE MISTOOK

02:24:06.238 --> 02:24:09.174 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED AND THAT'S ABOUT

02:24:07.639 --> 02:24:10.442 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:24:09.174 --> 02:24:12.177 region:rollup2
INPUT?

02:24:10.442 --> 02:24:13.678 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE.

02:24:12.177 --> 02:24:15.413 region:rollup2
CAN YOU TRANSPARENCY OF THE

02:24:13.678 --> 02:24:16.715 region:rollup2
WATER COMMISSION AND IT APPEARS

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:18.617 region:rollup2
TO BE AND I'M AN EMPHASIS OF THE

02:24:16.715 --> 02:24:19.050 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

02:24:18.617 --> 02:24:20.452 region:rollup2
AND.

02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:22.754 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION THOUGH AS I'VE

02:24:20.452 --> 02:24:24.422 region:rollup2
NOTED AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:25.490 region:rollup2
HAVE AND AND EMPHASIZED.

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:28.193 region:rollup2
HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE

02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:29.494 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS QUICKLY.

02:24:28.193 --> 02:24:30.762 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IS IMPORTANT AND WE

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:31.663 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WANT TO SEETHE

02:24:30.762 --> 02:24:33.532 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COMPLY WITH THE

02:24:31.663 --> 02:24:34.099 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE LAID OUT THE LAW AND TO

02:24:33.532 --> 02:24:36.334 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT.

02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:37.636 region:rollup2
THE DOLLARS DO GO TO FIND

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:39.337 region:rollup2
PROMISING PROJECTS.

02:24:37.636 --> 02:24:41.373 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:43.008 region:rollup2
SURE THAT EVERYONE WITH A STAKE.

02:24:41.373 --> 02:24:45.877 region:rollup2
AS A REASONABLE CHANCE TO FOLLOW

02:24:43.008 --> 02:24:47.979 region:rollup2
AND ASSESS THE PROCESS.

02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:50.415 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SCHEDULE LAID OUT OF

02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:52.717 region:rollup2
MY MY BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS.

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:53.518 region:rollup2
HAS ALLOWS ONLY TEN DAYS BETWEEN

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:55.320 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION STAFF

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:56.988 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR REVISED

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.190 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIOS WHICH IS.

02:24:56.988 --> 02:25:00.292 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT

02:24:58.190 --> 02:25:01.726 region:rollup2
CRITERIA FOR PROJECTS ELECTION.

02:25:00.292 --> 02:25:03.061 region:rollup2
A BETWEEN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:05.230 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSIONERS COMMISSION'S

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:06.965 region:rollup2
HEARING ON MY FIRST. TO MAKE A

02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:08.333 region:rollup2
DECISION ON RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:25:06.965 --> 02:25:09.634 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO

02:25:08.333 --> 02:25:11.202 region:rollup2
REASONABLY ALLOW FOR

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:13.138 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO DIGEST THE

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:14.339 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AT PRESENT CLEAR

02:25:13.138 --> 02:25:15.907 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINTS FOR THE

02:25:14.339 --> 02:25:17.909 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER.

02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:18.977 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF US SOURCE REQUESTING

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:20.211 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL TWO WEEKS IN THAT

02:25:18.977 --> 02:25:21.846 region:rollup2
WINDOW AND I THINK IT'S A

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:23.615 region:rollup2
REASONABLE QUEST.

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:24.416 region:rollup2
REQUEST GIVEN THE LEVEL OF

02:25:23.615 --> 02:25:26.251 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT DECISION THAT IS

02:25:24.416 --> 02:25:26.818 region:rollup2
BEING MADE NINE COURAGE THE

02:25:26.251 --> 02:25:28.119 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THAT

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:30.221 region:rollup2
REQUEST.

02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:31.790 region:rollup2
TO A CONCLUSION.

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:33.658 region:rollup2
I WOULD URGE YOU AND YOUR

02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:35.860 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE.

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:36.728 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND PERHAPS BE A BIT

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:37.862 region:rollup2
PATIENT WITH THE WATER

02:25:36.728 --> 02:25:39.331 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IN THEIR PROCESS

02:25:37.862 --> 02:25:40.532 region:rollup2
AS THEY CARRY OUT THE

02:25:39.331 --> 02:25:43.235 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S AND THE PUBLIC'S

02:25:40.532 --> 02:25:44.502 region:rollup2
MANDATE.

02:25:43.235 --> 02:25:45.670 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PART YOU PROPONENTS ARE

02:25:44.502 --> 02:25:47.072 region:rollup2
ANXIOUS TO GET A RESOLUTION AND

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:48.506 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES MOVE FORWARD.

02:25:47.072 --> 02:25:49.774 region:rollup2
CASES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR

02:25:48.506 --> 02:25:51.443 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN FACT WE ARE ALSO

02:25:49.774 --> 02:25:52.077 region:rollup2
ANXIOUS.

02:25:51.443 --> 02:25:53.945 region:rollup2
TO GET SOME OF THESE PROJECTS

02:25:52.077 --> 02:25:55.413 region:rollup2
OPERATING SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN

02:25:53.945 --> 02:25:57.616 region:rollup2
REALIZING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:58.149 region:rollup2
THAT THEY OFFER.

02:25:57.616 --> 02:25:59.484 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUICKEST OF THESE

02:25:58.149 --> 02:26:00.585 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:25:59.484 --> 02:26:02.187 region:rollup2
SOME THE GROUNDWATER PROJECTS

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:03.755 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE FIVE YEARS.

02:26:02.187 --> 02:26:04.456 region:rollup2
TO BE IMPLEMENTED UP TO FIVE

02:26:03.755 --> 02:26:05.657 region:rollup2
YEARS TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOME OF

02:26:04.456 --> 02:26:07.826 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE STORAGE PROJECTS TEN

02:26:05.657 --> 02:26:09.961 region:rollup2
TO FIFTEEN YEARS.

STAFF ON A NEED BASIS WELL I

02:31:31.149 --> 02:31:34.786 region:rollup2

THAT EXCEPT THAT.

02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:37.121 region:rollup2
.

02:31:36.287 --> 02:31:38.823 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HANDLE

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:40.391 region:rollup2

02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:42.427 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION THAT COMES UP IN

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:44.228 region:rollup2

IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AND I'VE

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:46.764 region:rollup2

02:31:48.166 --> 02:31:50.501 region:rollup2
MEETINGS. AND IT'S VERY

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:52.370 region:rollup2
INTERESTING BECAUSE IN SOME OF

CONNECTIONS THERE AND IT AND

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:10.254 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I HAVE TO SAY THAT

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:11.155 region:rollup2
THOSE MEETINGS VARIED I THINK IN

02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:12.590 region:rollup2
THEIR SUCCESS WILL HAVE TO SEE

02:32:11.155 --> 02:32:13.958 region:rollup2

ONLY THING AND I THINK IT'S A

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:20.732 region:rollup2
GOOD QUESTION.

02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:22.767 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN

02:32:20.732 --> 02:32:24.168 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY. OBLIGATE THE TWO POINT

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:47.178 region:rollup2
SEVEN SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

02:34:45.676 --> 02:34:48.813 region:rollup2
SEE IT START GOING TOWARDS

02:34:47.178 --> 02:34:50.548 region:rollup2

I HOPE THAT COULD IT GO HIT

02:34:54.185 --> 02:34:55.820 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:58.256 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

OWN TIMELINE RIGHT. SO.

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:12.637 region:rollup2

THESE PROJECTS THAT HAVE LONG.

02:35:17.575 --> 02:35:20.478 region:rollup2
PRE CONSTRUCTION.

02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:22.980 region:rollup2
TIMELINES.

02:35:20.478 --> 02:35:24.549 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO COMPLETE.

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:26.884 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ELEMENTS.

02:35:24.549 --> 02:35:28.819 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE DEEMED.

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:30.888 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN DOCUMENTS OTHERWISE

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:32.557 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE

AND THAT'S STATED IN THE BOND

02:35:35.059 --> 02:35:37.862 region:rollup2
NO.

02:35:36.761 --> 02:35:39.564 region:rollup2
YET EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE

IF NO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:56.681 region:rollup2
THEN YOU REEVALUATE THAT.

02:35:54.345 --> 02:35:58.549 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO USEFUL FOR I KNOW

02:35:56.681 --> 02:35:59.116 region:rollup2
FOR MYSELF AND PROBABLY SOME OF

02:35:58.549 --> 02:36:00.117 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES TO GO BACK AND

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:01.452 region:rollup2

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:20.838 region:rollup2
AND SAY THIS IS THE GOAL OF THIS

02:36:19.537 --> 02:36:22.607 region:rollup2

02:37:00.845 --> 02:37:04.515 region:rollup2
MAURICE.

02:37:02.546 --> 02:37:07.251 region:rollup2
NEED OF THIS IS CARBON A NEW

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:09.620 region:rollup2
PATH FORWARD AND AND SO IT IS

02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:11.555 region:rollup2
TAKING I THINK MORE WORK THAN

02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:13.190 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ALL EXPECTED BUT IT'S

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:15.226 region:rollup2
ALSO REALLY CRITICAL I THINK IN

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:16.727 region:rollup2
TERMS OF. OF.

02:37:15.226 --> 02:37:17.728 region:rollup2
GOING.

02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:19.163 region:rollup2
I THINK FUTURE PROCESSES

02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:20.431 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN WE WILL

02:37:19.163 --> 02:37:20.998 region:rollup2
LEARN A LOT IN THIS PROCESS AND

02:37:20.431 --> 02:37:22.967 region:rollup2
MAKE FUTURE PROCESS

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:23.801 region:rollup2
SMOOTHER.

02:37:22.967 --> 02:37:25.303 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND.

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:27.305 region:rollup2
AND I THINK OF IT ALSO IS AYE

02:37:25.303 --> 02:37:28.739 region:rollup2
ICE SERVICE ELECTED MEMBER OF A

02:37:27.305 --> 02:37:30.374 region:rollup2
BORDER OF WATER PROGRESS LIVE.

02:37:28.739 --> 02:37:32.109 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WERE TO BUILD OUR OWN

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:33.210 region:rollup2
WATER STORAGE PROJECT WE WOULD

02:37:32.109 --> 02:37:35.212 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE TO MEET STATE

02:37:33.210 --> 02:37:35.713 region:rollup2

DOWNSTREAM ENVIRONMENTAL

02:37:35.713 --> 02:37:40.418 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:41.686 region:rollup2
AND SO. OUTSIDE OF OF THESE

02:37:40.418 --> 02:37:43.788 region:rollup2
FUNDS ANYBODY WHO'S DOING A

02:37:41.686 --> 02:37:45.022 region:rollup2

HIGHER LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN.

02:39:39.637 --> 02:39:44.508 region:rollup2

INCLUSIVENESS OF STAKEHOLDERS I

02:39:49.313 --> 02:39:53.517 region:rollup2

BEFORE THE APRIL. TWENTIETH SO

02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:20.037 region:rollup2

WRITTEN.

02:42:04.848 --> 02:42:06.984 region:rollup2
.

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:08.786 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION CANNOT ALLOCATE

02:42:32.109 --> 02:42:34.445 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE WOULD MIGHT BE

02:42:33.344 --> 02:42:35.879 region:rollup2

ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS THAT'S TRUE

02:45:03.694 --> 02:45:07.297 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:45:05.462 --> 02:45:08.098 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE PRE

IS.

02:45:10.167 --> 02:45:13.704 region:rollup2
THE INTERACTION THAT EVERYBODY

02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:14.805 region:rollup2
LIKED SO MUCH WAS AFTER WE HAD A

02:45:13.704 --> 02:45:15.906 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DOCUMENT RELEASED IN

02:45:14.805 --> 02:45:17.241 region:rollup2
FEBRUARY WHEN WE COULD TALK

02:45:15.906 --> 02:45:19.743 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:45:17.241 --> 02:45:20.878 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STAFF HAD DONE YEAH?

02:45:19.743 --> 02:45:22.079 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DIFFICULT PROBLEMATIC

02:45:20.878 --> 02:45:23.480 region:rollup2
FOR US BECAUSE NEARLY ALL OF THE

02:45:22.079 --> 02:45:25.616 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS

02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:27.785 region:rollup2
NOW GONE TO APPEAL AND EVERYBODY

02:45:25.616 --> 02:45:29.453 region:rollup2

02:45:29.453 --> 02:45:33.857 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:45:30.788 --> 02:45:35.826 region:rollup2
FIGHTING AGAINST UP HERE.

02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:37.661 region:rollup2
SO THE DID WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

02:45:35.826 --> 02:45:39.396 region:rollup2
THE APPLICANT SIDE IS THAT. THEY

02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:40.330 region:rollup2

STAFF TO ASK THEM CLARIFYING

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:43.133 region:rollup2

FOR THE TWENTY OF.

02:45:43.133 --> 02:45:46.637 region:rollup2
SO IF STAFF ASKED ONE APPLICANT

A CLARIFYING QUESTION AND HAS NO

02:45:46.637 --> 02:45:50.808 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:51.909 region:rollup2
THE OTHER APPLICANTS.

02:45:50.808 --> 02:45:52.743 region:rollup2

APPLICANTS

02:45:52.743 --> 02:45:55.612 region:rollup2
DO WORSE ORG.

02:45:55.045 --> 02:45:58.348 region:rollup2
THAN THE ONE THEY ASKED THE

02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:59.883 region:rollup2
QUESTION TWO IS THAT IT IS THAT.

02:45:58.348 --> 02:46:01.151 region:rollup2
IS THAT FAIR TO ALL APPLICANTS

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:03.120 region:rollup2
SOME ALMOST STUCK IN THAT PLACE

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:04.154 region:rollup2
OF SAYING HOW DO I ASK QUESTIONS

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:06.824 region:rollup2
OF EVERYBODY IF I DON'T HAVE

02:46:04.154 --> 02:46:08.258 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OF EVERYBODY AND IS IT

02:46:06.824 --> 02:46:09.593 region:rollup2
FAIR FIREHOUSES QUESTIONS.

02:46:08.258 --> 02:46:11.228 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE OUTCOME

02:46:09.593 --> 02:46:12.763 region:rollup2
FROM THE STAFF REVIEW

02:46:11.228 --> 02:46:13.664 region:rollup2
AND SO WE CAN RAISE SOME

02:46:12.763 --> 02:46:15.866 region:rollup2
UNFAIRNESS QUESTIONS.

02:46:13.664 --> 02:46:17.634 region:rollup2
ARE SOME.

02:46:15.866 --> 02:46:19.603 region:rollup2
UNFAIRNESS ISSUES

02:46:17.634 --> 02:46:20.904 region:rollup2
WITH THAT RUBRIC AND THAT'S WHAT

02:46:19.603 --> 02:46:22.773 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH

02:46:20.904 --> 02:46:24.174 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHEN IS IT TIME TO

02:46:22.773 --> 02:46:26.343 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW FOLKS TO COME IN AND

WHEN DO WE HAVE. THE DISCUSSIONS

02:46:26.343 --> 02:46:31.715 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S EASIER FROM THE

02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:33.817 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SIDE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:46:31.715 --> 02:46:35.352 region:rollup2
BE ASK QUESTIONS BY APPLICANTS

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:38.622 region:rollup2
BY STAKEHOLDERS AND US TO

EXPLAIN. WHAT STAFF IS DOING?

02:46:38.622 --> 02:46:42.459 region:rollup2
MY ABILITY TO DO THAT BEFORE I

LIKE MOVING UP MY RELEASE DATE.

02:46:46.697 --> 02:46:48.665 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE ARE SOME ISSUES

02:46:48.098 --> 02:46:51.535 region:rollup2

AT THE END OF.

IT WOULD BEHOOVE THE COMMISSION

02:47:56.867 --> 02:47:59.336 region:rollup2
I THINK JUST TO HAVE PROVIDE

THEY'RE GONNA HAVE BENEFITS FOR

02:55:46.035 --> 02:55:49.239 region:rollup2
FISH BY PROVIDING COLD WATER FOR

02:55:47.604 --> 02:55:50.573 region:rollup2
SO MANY DAYS. WHAT TURNS OUT

02:55:49.239 --> 02:55:51.941 region:rollup2
THAT?

02:55:50.573 --> 02:55:53.343 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA USE A FICTITIOUS

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:54.611 region:rollup2

AND SO THEN THERE'S A

02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:09.025 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION THEIR OF SO HOW DO

02:56:06.156 --> 02:56:09.626 region:rollup2
WE DO THIS AND SO THAT THOSE ARE

02:56:09.025 --> 02:56:11.928 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT THE.

02:56:35.051 --> 02:56:37.654 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE

02:56:36.086 --> 02:56:39.522 region:rollup2

WORKING ON THIS I'M NOT AWARE OF

02:56:55.405 --> 02:56:58.475 region:rollup2
ANY UP PRESSURE THAT THEY'RE

02:56:57.140 --> 02:57:00.577 region:rollup2

THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT. WHAT THE

02:57:06.549 --> 02:57:08.985 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES ARE GOING TO BE THEY

YOU KNOW I I I DON'T KNOW HOW TO

02:57:23.967 --> 02:57:26.369 region:rollup2
ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT.

02:57:25.835 --> 02:57:27.704 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT SUBSEQUENT

TWENTIETH.

02:57:31.708 --> 02:57:34.978 region:rollup2
RIGHT WELL I GUESS WHAT I WOULD

02:57:32.842 --> 02:57:35.879 region:rollup2
JUST AND WITH IS OKAY I THINK WE

02:57:34.978 --> 02:57:37.714 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT MEAN

02:57:35.879 --> 02:57:39.582 region:rollup2
HAPPENS BEFORE THE TWENTIETH SO

02:57:37.714 --> 02:57:41.017 region:rollup2
THAT WE MAY.

02:57:39.582 --> 02:57:42.485 region:rollup2
SO ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE

02:57:41.017 --> 02:57:43.219 region:rollup2
CLEARED UP THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

02:57:42.485 --> 02:57:45.421 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL MEETING.

02:57:45.421 --> 02:57:49.025 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:57:45.688 --> 02:57:50.293 region:rollup2
.

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:51.694 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I WOULD DISTRESS TO THE

02:57:50.293 --> 02:57:53.062 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS IT LOOK THIS HAS

02:57:51.694 --> 02:57:55.331 region:rollup2
BEEN PLACED IN YOUR HANDS AND

02:57:53.062 --> 02:57:55.999 region:rollup2
REALLY IN YOUR HANDS ALONE.

02:57:55.331 --> 02:57:58.167 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THESE ULTIMATE

02:57:55.999 --> 02:58:00.203 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS.

02:57:58.167 --> 02:58:02.372 region:rollup2
AND.

02:58:00.203 --> 02:58:04.774 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATUE

02:58:02.372 --> 02:58:06.409 region:rollup2
YOU CAN LOOK AT THESE RAGS AND

02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:07.777 region:rollup2
WHAT I WHAT I THINK IS SOMETIMES

02:58:06.409 --> 02:58:09.212 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IS JUST A DIFFERENCE

02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:11.614 region:rollup2
IN OPINION.

02:58:09.212 --> 02:58:13.316 region:rollup2
A ABOUT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:15.151 region:rollup2
MEANS IN ANY SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:58:13.316 --> 02:58:16.586 region:rollup2
APPLYING STANDARDS WILL.

02:58:15.151 --> 02:58:17.987 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES THE

02:58:16.586 --> 02:58:19.322 region:rollup2
STANDARDS CHANGE DEPENDING ON

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:20.490 region:rollup2
WHO YOU TALK TO.

02:58:19.322 --> 02:58:22.792 region:rollup2
AND.

02:58:20.490 --> 02:58:23.993 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT BE

02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:25.762 region:rollup2
APPLYING A STANDARD THAT.

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:27.530 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE IS ALSO VERY WELL

02:58:25.762 --> 02:58:28.865 region:rollup2
VERSED IN THIS DISAGREES WITH

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:30.633 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND SAYS NOW LOOK AT

02:58:28.865 --> 02:58:32.835 region:rollup2
THE DATA. WE CAN SHOW YOU THAT

02:58:30.633 --> 02:58:34.737 region:rollup2
THIS SUCH AND SUCH AS COLD WATER

02:58:32.835 --> 02:58:36.372 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOES HELP FISH.

02:58:34.737 --> 02:58:37.707 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND IS IT JUST THAT HEY

02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:39.709 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT WILDLIFE SAYS NO

02:58:37.707 --> 02:58:41.277 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST THE BOTTOM LINE.

02:58:39.709 --> 02:58:43.580 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND EVEN IF THERE IS

02:58:41.277 --> 02:58:45.582 region:rollup2
DATA THAT SHOWS IT'S NOT SO. WE

02:58:43.580 --> 02:58:46.983 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER

02:58:45.582 --> 02:58:48.451 region:rollup2
IS THAT JUST THEIR THE END ALL

02:58:46.983 --> 02:58:49.986 region:rollup2
BE ALL.

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:51.788 region:rollup2

02:58:51.788 --> 02:58:56.359 region:rollup2
DECISION. YOUR COMMISSION MAKES

02:58:54.057 --> 02:58:57.760 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION AND SAYS NO. WE'VE

02:58:56.359 --> 02:58:59.662 region:rollup2

CRITERIA OUTLINED IN HERE

02:59:02.565 --> 02:59:04.901 region:rollup2
CRITERIA THAT WE ALL HELP SET

02:59:03.166 --> 02:59:05.835 region:rollup2
UP.

02:59:04.901 --> 02:59:07.270 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO

02:59:05.835 --> 02:59:08.771 region:rollup2

02:59:10.173 --> 02:59:13.142 region:rollup2
PUT SOME STAFF PERSON AND THAT

02:59:11.608 --> 02:59:14.811 region:rollup2
IS THE END ALL BE ALL AND IT'S

02:59:13.142 --> 02:59:16.112 region:rollup2
NOT ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION'S

02:59:14.811 --> 02:59:18.181 region:rollup2
DECISION.

02:59:16.112 --> 02:59:19.515 region:rollup2
NO AT ON SOME THESE ITEMS

02:59:18.181 --> 02:59:20.717 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M JUST HEARING THAT

02:59:19.515 --> 02:59:23.720 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME.

02:59:20.717 --> 02:59:25.255 region:rollup2

THERE IS SOME DISPUTE WELL AS

02:59:25.255 --> 02:59:29.559 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE THINGS.

02:59:27.423 --> 02:59:30.226 region:rollup2
REASONABLE DISPUTE AND ONE OF

02:59:29.559 --> 02:59:31.561 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT ALSO WOULD WANT

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:32.962 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT THE

02:59:31.561 --> 02:59:33.796 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS WITH THE

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:35.131 region:rollup2

INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL

02:59:40.036 --> 02:59:42.605 region:rollup2
OF THESE AGENCIES IN THE COMBAT

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:43.239 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH THE

02:59:42.605 --> 02:59:45.241 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:59:43.239 --> 02:59:46.409 region:rollup2

02:59:53.149 --> 02:59:55.752 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP IN THE

02:59:54.384 --> 02:59:57.287 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FORUM.

02:59:55.752 --> 02:59:58.554 region:rollup2
ON EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS

02:59:57.287 --> 02:59:59.589 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ITS NOT A SITUATION

02:59:58.554 --> 03:00:00.790 region:rollup2
WHERE THE COMMISSION IS JUST

02:59:59.589 --> 03:00:01.958 region:rollup2
GOING TO ACCEPT.

03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:03.393 region:rollup2
SCORES AS THEY ARE HANDED TO US

BY STAFF.

03:00:03.393 --> 03:00:07.230 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS GOING TO BE

03:00:04.727 --> 03:00:08.765 region:rollup2
CONTINUING DISCUSSION UP THROUGH

03:00:07.230 --> 03:00:10.700 region:rollup2

FINAL DETERMINATIONS AT THAT

03:00:12.035 --> 03:00:14.671 region:rollup2
POINT.

03:00:13.703 --> 03:00:16.139 region:rollup2
THANK YOU WAS GALLAGHER.

03:00:14.671 --> 03:00:18.374 region:rollup2

RECOMMENDING TO THIS COMMITTEE.

03:00:18.374 --> 03:00:22.345 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE DRAFT THE LETTER TO

03:00:20.209 --> 03:00:24.047 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION.

03:00:22.345 --> 03:00:25.081 region:rollup2

OF THE.

03:00:27.817 --> 03:00:31.554 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL GATHERING.

03:00:29.686 --> 03:00:33.523 region:rollup2
A PRIOR TO THE APRIL TWENTIETH A

03:00:31.554 --> 03:00:35.158 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD THAT BE

03:00:33.523 --> 03:00:36.225 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO SEARS CONSIDERATION BY

03:00:35.158 --> 03:00:38.227 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE COMMISSION.

03:00:36.225 --> 03:00:40.630 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT AMONGST THE

03:00:38.227 --> 03:00:42.598 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS CAN DETERMINE HOW

03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:44.367 region:rollup2
BEST TO A STRUCTURE. THAT

03:00:42.598 --> 03:00:46.469 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITHOUT THE LEADING

03:00:44.367 --> 03:00:48.805 region:rollup2

03:00:46.469 --> 03:00:50.640 region:rollup2

I YEAR SCORING.

03:00:51.808 --> 03:00:55.678 region:rollup2
BUT THAT CERTAINLY THINK IT

03:00:53.376 --> 03:00:56.479 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WELCOMED THE

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.413 region:rollup2

THAT LETTER I THINK THAT'S AN

03:01:09.659 --> 03:01:12.462 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

03:01:11.127 --> 03:01:14.697 region:rollup2
FACTOR.

03:01:12.462 --> 03:01:16.499 region:rollup2
.

03:01:14.697 --> 03:01:18.000 region:rollup2

YOUR UNDERSTANDINGS IN YOUR

THINKING.

03:01:22.405 --> 03:01:26.008 region:rollup2
I THINK.

03:01:24.841 --> 03:01:28.211 region:rollup2
AT WORST LISTENING HERE WERE

03:01:26.008 --> 03:01:28.778 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

03:01:28.211 --> 03:01:30.613 region:rollup2
I LOT MORE ABOUT THE

03:01:28.778 --> 03:01:31.147 region:rollup2
ENLIGHTENMENT OF WHAT'S BEEN

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:32.582 region:rollup2
HAPPENING WHAT HASN'T BEEN

03:01:31.147 --> 03:01:33.750 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

03:01:32.582 --> 03:01:34.817 region:rollup2
I THINK THE REAL CRUX OF THE

03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:35.785 region:rollup2
ISSUE LEAST I'M TAKING AWAY

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:37.987 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

03:01:35.785 --> 03:01:40.223 region:rollup2
IS THERE'S BEEN A.

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:43.226 region:rollup2
WELL OPEN DIALOGUE.

03:01:40.223 --> 03:01:44.093 region:rollup2
AND INFORMATION SOMEWHAT GOING

03:01:43.226 --> 03:01:46.562 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH THERE'S BEEN SOME

03:01:44.093 --> 03:01:47.663 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT.

03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:49.899 region:rollup2
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO

03:01:47.663 --> 03:01:50.833 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:01:49.899 --> 03:01:52.301 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SITTING ON THE COMMISSION

03:01:50.833 --> 03:01:53.403 region:rollup2
SIDE.

03:01:52.301 --> 03:01:54.937 region:rollup2
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

03:01:53.403 --> 03:01:57.340 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS.

03:01:54.937 --> 03:01:59.108 region:rollup2
WE'RE SO FAR APART.

03:01:57.340 --> 03:02:01.878 region:rollup2
I FIND IT HARD.

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:03.679 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND WHEN.

03:02:01.878 --> 03:02:04.847 region:rollup2
JUST USING ONE PROJECT OUT THERE

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:07.083 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS.

03:02:04.847 --> 03:02:08.818 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED.

03:02:07.083 --> 03:02:09.418 region:rollup2
IT WILL RETURN A PUBLIC BENEFIT

03:02:08.818 --> 03:02:12.121 region:rollup2
OF TWO DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SIX

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:14.524 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:16.726 region:rollup2
BUT ESCORTED ZERO.

03:02:14.524 --> 03:02:19.295 region:rollup2
WHAT INFORMATION?

03:02:16.726 --> 03:02:21.564 region:rollup2
WAS LACKING.

03:02:19.295 --> 03:02:24.233 region:rollup2
SO I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE.

03:02:21.564 --> 03:02:25.334 region:rollup2
MAYBE ALL THE INFORMATION.

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:27.370 region:rollup2
WASN'T FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY

03:02:25.334 --> 03:02:28.171 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY.

03:02:27.370 --> 03:02:29.038 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WAS

03:02:28.171 --> 03:02:31.107 region:rollup2
SPENT.

03:02:29.038 --> 03:02:34.844 region:rollup2
MILLIONS.

03:02:31.107 --> 03:02:36.546 region:rollup2
GETTING APPLICATIONS.

03:02:34.844 --> 03:02:37.613 region:rollup2
ROCK PORT ONLY SCORED ZERO.

03:02:36.546 --> 03:02:39.882 region:rollup2
EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDE CAN'T BE

03:02:37.613 --> 03:02:41.684 region:rollup2
THAT FAR APART.

03:02:39.882 --> 03:02:43.085 region:rollup2
SO I I ACTUALLY COME BACK TO

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:44.921 region:rollup2
WHAT MR SOLVES IS SAYING WHAT MR

03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:46.656 region:rollup2
GALLAGHER SAYING.

03:02:44.921 --> 03:02:47.924 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'D THAT DOES NEED

03:02:46.656 --> 03:02:48.424 region:rollup2
TO BE A WINDOW AND I UNDERSTAND.

03:02:47.924 --> 03:02:50.626 region:rollup2
WHY MR YA?

03:02:48.424 --> 03:02:52.562 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:02:50.626 --> 03:02:54.997 region:rollup2
HE WANTED SILOS

03:02:52.562 --> 03:02:56.232 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS A FAIRNESS ISSUE.

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:58.267 region:rollup2
BUT HIS SYSTEM OR THE

03:02:56.232 --> 03:03:00.002 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT.

03:02:58.267 --> 03:03:00.703 region:rollup2
I SOMEHOW BROKE DOWN. SO THAT

03:03:00.002 --> 03:03:03.406 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GETTING PROJECTS

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:05.041 region:rollup2
AS.

03:03:03.406 --> 03:03:07.109 region:rollup2
WELL PRESENTED AND SUCCESSFUL AS

03:03:05.041 --> 03:03:10.012 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:12.715 region:rollup2
THE HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD ZEROS.

03:03:10.012 --> 03:03:15.151 region:rollup2
SAYS IT WAS BAD INFORMATION OUT

03:03:12.715 --> 03:03:16.919 region:rollup2
AND THAT INFORMATION IS.

03:03:15.151 --> 03:03:17.453 region:rollup2
WE START WITH THAT INFORMATION.

03:03:16.919 --> 03:03:18.821 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA END WITH THAT

03:03:17.453 --> 03:03:20.590 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:22.258 region:rollup2
I WILL BE CONSISTENT.

03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:22.792 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT A FIX THAT I THINK

03:03:22.258 --> 03:03:24.827 region:rollup2
THAT'S INCOME BUT UPON THE

03:03:22.792 --> 03:03:25.828 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:27.563 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY.

03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:29.732 region:rollup2
WON'T ALLEY.

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:32.235 region:rollup2
WE HAD A PROBLEM.

03:03:29.732 --> 03:03:33.970 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN FIX IT.

03:03:32.235 --> 03:03:35.271 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU AS A BODY CAN STEP

03:03:33.970 --> 03:03:37.373 region:rollup2
UP YOUR STAFF.

03:03:35.271 --> 03:03:37.940 region:rollup2
AND SAY LOOK.

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:40.276 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO WORK WITH THESE

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:42.078 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

03:03:40.276 --> 03:03:42.678 region:rollup2
SHE GALLAGHER WANTS A COMMITMENT

03:03:42.078 --> 03:03:44.747 region:rollup2
I THINK LETTER NOW FROM THE

03:03:42.678 --> 03:03:46.616 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN IT'S GOING TO BE ASKING

03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:49.151 region:rollup2
FOR. FOR THAT.

03:03:46.616 --> 03:03:52.288 region:rollup2
THEN AND I'M SUPPORTIVE THAT.

03:03:49.151 --> 03:03:54.090 region:rollup2
IS IT POSSIBLE.

03:03:52.288 --> 03:03:55.424 region:rollup2
FOR US TO HEAR SOME.

03:03:54.090 --> 03:03:57.059 region:rollup2
SOME TAILORED DID POINT THAT

03:03:55.424 --> 03:03:57.894 region:rollup2
SAYS.

03:03:57.059 --> 03:04:01.464 region:rollup2
YEAH WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT

03:03:57.894 --> 03:04:04.834 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:04:01.464 --> 03:04:06.068 region:rollup2
LOOK AT GIVING AN OPEN.

03:04:04.834 --> 03:04:08.004 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLICANTS.

03:04:06.068 --> 03:04:08.838 region:rollup2
STAFF

03:04:08.004 --> 03:04:10.806 region:rollup2
TO GET MORE CLARIFYING

03:04:08.838 --> 03:04:11.340 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

03:04:10.806 --> 03:04:12.742 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S PROJECTS CAN BE

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:14.510 region:rollup2
LOOKED.

03:04:12.742 --> 03:04:17.079 region:rollup2
NOT IN A PARTISAN WAY WITH

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:19.348 region:rollup2
FAVORITISM BUT WITH AN AYE OF.

03:04:17.079 --> 03:04:22.485 region:rollup2
TRUE BREATH OF UNDERSTANDING OF

03:04:19.348 --> 03:04:24.120 region:rollup2
WHAT EACH WAS SAYING AND MOUNT.

03:04:22.485 --> 03:04:25.888 region:rollup2
A POSSIBLE TO HAVE THAT.

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:37.212 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION OF PUBLIC BENEFIT

03:12:35.677 --> 03:12:38.414 region:rollup2
THAT THIS MONEY ISN'T RELLY

03:12:37.212 --> 03:12:40.716 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THEM TO FINANCE THEIR

03:12:38.414 --> 03:12:42.384 region:rollup2
THEIR PROJECTS PERIOD. AND IT

03:12:40.716 --> 03:12:43.752 region:rollup2
TAKES A LOT OF EDUCATION FOR

03:12:42.384 --> 03:12:44.820 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:12:43.752 --> 03:12:46.989 region:rollup2

EARLIER ON IN THE DEVELOPMENT.

03:13:07.443 --> 03:13:11.313 region:rollup2

OF WHAT THE COMMISSION WAS

03:13:17.719 --> 03:13:23.592 region:rollup2

THERE WERE A LOT OF SORT OF

03:13:58.527 --> 03:14:03.198 region:rollup2
CAMPS ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY WAS

03:14:00.162 --> 03:14:04.600 region:rollup2
TO BE USED FOR AND THAT. ARM

03:14:03.198 --> 03:14:07.336 region:rollup2
THAT REMAINED AS MUCH AS WE

03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:08.504 region:rollup2
TRIED TO SAY HERE'S HERE'S THE

03:14:07.336 --> 03:14:09.071 region:rollup2
SIDEBOARDS OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING

03:14:08.504 --> 03:14:10.305 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:14:09.071 --> 03:14:12.875 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

WE CONTINUE TO HEAR STORIES

03:14:12.875 --> 03:14:16.411 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THIS MONEY FROM

03:14:14.576 --> 03:14:18.013 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS HOW THIS

03:14:16.411 --> 03:14:20.115 region:rollup2
MONEY IS SUPPOSE TO BE SPENT.

03:14:18.013 --> 03:14:21.583 region:rollup2
ALBUM AND WE REALLY TRIED TO

COMMUNICATE THAT LOOK WE'RE

03:14:21.583 --> 03:14:24.453 region:rollup2
WE'RE HANDED THIS TASK.

03:14:23.151 --> 03:14:26.555 region:rollup2
OF CREATING A COMPETITIVE

03:14:24.453 --> 03:14:27.189 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT HAS TO DO WITH

03:14:26.555 --> 03:14:28.423 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFITS AND I THINK THAT

03:14:27.189 --> 03:14:28.957 region:rollup2
IT.

03:14:28.423 --> 03:14:30.759 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS MISTER HALL

03:14:28.957 --> 03:14:32.761 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IN THAT THIS WAS THIS

03:14:30.759 --> 03:14:34.229 region:rollup2
IS A UNIQUE BEAST AND THAT SHIFT

03:14:32.761 --> 03:14:36.198 region:rollup2
IN THINKING.

03:14:34.229 --> 03:14:37.633 region:rollup2
ARM IS REALLY TOUGH AND I THINK

03:14:36.198 --> 03:14:40.068 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR FOLKS WHO WORK WITH

03:14:37.633 --> 03:14:41.136 region:rollup2
WATER UTILITIES A FAIR AMOUNT IT

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:42.404 region:rollup2
WAS IT WAS A TOUGH THING TO THE

03:14:41.136 --> 03:14:43.071 region:rollup2
TIP.

03:14:42.404 --> 03:14:45.607 region:rollup2
MANAGE AND SO.

03:14:43.071 --> 03:14:48.744 region:rollup2
.

03:14:45.607 --> 03:14:50.979 region:rollup2
I I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WERE IN

03:14:48.744 --> 03:14:52.514 region:rollup2
THE LAST DAYS OF WORKING ON THE

03:14:50.979 --> 03:14:54.082 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS IN EVERYBODY CAME UP

03:14:52.514 --> 03:14:55.417 region:rollup2
MY MEMORY IS THAT EVERYBODY YOU

03:14:54.082 --> 03:14:57.252 region:rollup2
CAME UP TO COMMENT.ꞯ

03:14:55.417 --> 03:14:59.354 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF THE TWO YEAR PROCESS

03:14:57.252 --> 03:15:01.256 region:rollup2
OF CREATING REGULATIONS WE HAD

03:14:59.354 --> 03:15:02.457 region:rollup2
POSITIVE COMMENTS FROM THE WATER

03:15:01.256 --> 03:15:05.294 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WE HAD POSITIVE

03:15:02.457 --> 03:15:08.197 region:rollup2
COMMENTS FROM. THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:15:05.294 --> 03:15:09.831 region:rollup2
GROUPS AND FROM TRIBES AND FROM.

03:15:08.197 --> 03:15:12.401 region:rollup2
OF THE WATER UTILITIES AND ONE

03:15:09.831 --> 03:15:13.835 region:rollup2
THING THAT I REMEMBER HEARING IS

03:15:12.401 --> 03:15:14.836 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY SAID YOU KNOW THESE

03:15:13.835 --> 03:15:16.071 region:rollup2
ARE PRETTY GOOD IT'S NOT

03:15:14.836 --> 03:15:18.307 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED.

03:15:16.071 --> 03:15:19.675 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD AND

03:15:18.307 --> 03:15:22.578 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT.

03:15:19.675 --> 03:15:24.947 region:rollup2
.

03:15:22.578 --> 03:15:26.381 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK THAT STAFF.

03:15:24.947 --> 03:15:29.117 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMISSION WE TRIED OUR

03:15:26.381 --> 03:15:30.819 region:rollup2
OUR BEST TO TO CREATE THAT LEVEL

03:15:29.117 --> 03:15:33.422 region:rollup2
OF UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT.

03:15:30.819 --> 03:15:35.123 region:rollup2
.

03:15:33.422 --> 03:15:37.426 region:rollup2
WE HAD CONTINUED HAVE WORK TO DO

03:15:35.123 --> 03:15:39.094 region:rollup2
MARK YEAH I IT'S YOU KNOW

03:15:37.426 --> 03:15:39.661 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO.

03:15:39.094 --> 03:15:41.229 region:rollup2
ASTROLOGY ONE IN THE COMING

03:15:39.661 --> 03:15:42.965 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT.

03:15:41.229 --> 03:15:44.700 region:rollup2
IT JUST COUPLE COMMENTS SAID

03:15:42.965 --> 03:15:46.535 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF.

03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:47.436 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINTS AND THAT HAVE

03:15:46.535 --> 03:15:48.704 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE.

03:15:47.436 --> 03:15:49.938 region:rollup2
HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO

03:15:48.704 --> 03:15:50.539 region:rollup2
DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:15:49.938 --> 03:15:51.373 region:rollup2
GETTING US RIGHT I DON'T WANT

03:15:50.539 --> 03:15:52.407 region:rollup2
TO.

03:15:51.373 --> 03:15:53.809 region:rollup2
DIMINISH THE URGENCY OF IT BUT I

03:15:52.407 --> 03:15:55.577 region:rollup2
THINK.

03:15:53.809 --> 03:15:57.512 region:rollup2
WE ARE CERTAINLY DEALING WITH.

03:15:55.577 --> 03:15:59.381 region:rollup2
A SITUATION AS I DESCRIBED

03:15:57.512 --> 03:16:01.249 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE BREAKING NEW GROUND

03:15:59.381 --> 03:16:02.718 region:rollup2
WE ARE FIGURING THINGS OUT AS WE

03:16:01.249 --> 03:16:05.187 region:rollup2
GO AND.

03:16:02.718 --> 03:16:07.155 region:rollup2
IF IF WE WERE. LOOKING TO BUILD

03:16:05.187 --> 03:16:08.290 region:rollup2
WATER STORAGE PROJECTS THAT MET

03:16:07.155 --> 03:16:09.992 region:rollup2
SOME SPECIFIC POWER GENERATION

03:16:08.290 --> 03:16:11.660 region:rollup2
NEED.

03:16:09.992 --> 03:16:12.995 region:rollup2
THERE'S AB RECIPE AND SOME

03:16:11.660 --> 03:16:14.129 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING BOOK SOMEWHERE THAT

03:16:12.995 --> 03:16:15.264 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WOULD LOOK TO AND CLICK

03:16:14.129 --> 03:16:16.832 region:rollup2
THROUGH AND SAY HERE'S WHAT

03:16:15.264 --> 03:16:19.968 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA DO AND SO.

03:16:16.832 --> 03:16:21.703 region:rollup2
I'D AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF MY

03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:23.939 region:rollup2
IN JAIL COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:25.507 region:rollup2
BEEN INVOLVED ALONG THE WAY

03:16:23.939 --> 03:16:27.476 region:rollup2
PROVIDING INPUT.

03:16:25.507 --> 03:16:28.977 region:rollup2
WE FELT THAT THE STAFF HAS BEEN

03:16:27.476 --> 03:16:30.646 region:rollup2
QUITE RESPONSIVE TO OUR INPUT

03:16:28.977 --> 03:16:31.246 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THE COMMISSION'S

03:16:30.646 --> 03:16:32.914 region:rollup2
MEMBERS SPONSOR BUT THERE ARE

03:16:31.246 --> 03:16:34.750 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO

03:16:32.914 --> 03:16:36.385 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN AND THERE THAT.

03:16:34.750 --> 03:16:37.285 region:rollup2
THAT OUT IN THE REGULATIONS FOR

03:16:36.385 --> 03:16:39.087 region:rollup2
INSTANCE THAT I DIDN'T SEE YOU

03:16:37.285 --> 03:16:40.589 region:rollup2
BUT. I'M SURE THEIR NEIGHBOR

03:16:39.087 --> 03:16:41.957 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN

03:16:40.589 --> 03:16:42.658 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS AND PROBABLY

03:16:41.957 --> 03:16:44.493 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THOSE.

03:16:42.658 --> 03:16:46.161 region:rollup2
I DO THINK.

03:16:44.493 --> 03:16:47.796 region:rollup2
YEAH IF I HAD HAD THE CHANCE

03:16:46.161 --> 03:16:48.997 region:rollup2
TO DO IT I WOULD PROBABLY DO IT

03:16:47.796 --> 03:16:51.433 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT I

03:16:48.997 --> 03:16:52.367 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ALSO CAN'T.

03:16:51.433 --> 03:16:54.069 region:rollup2
BE CERTAIN THAT THE WAY I THINK

03:16:52.367 --> 03:16:55.237 region:rollup2
IT WOULD'VE WORKED ANY BETTER

03:16:54.069 --> 03:16:57.105 region:rollup2
AND I'M CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD'VE

03:16:55.237 --> 03:16:57.906 region:rollup2
HAD KINKS TO WORK OUT AND

03:16:57.105 --> 03:16:59.541 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO.

03:16:57.906 --> 03:17:01.143 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THAT TO SAY.

03:16:59.541 --> 03:17:02.611 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS.

03:17:01.143 --> 03:17:04.746 region:rollup2
GOOD REASONS THAT WE'RE

03:17:02.611 --> 03:17:06.748 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH S..

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:07.949 region:rollup2
OVERALL I. ENCOURAGE THE

03:17:06.748 --> 03:17:09.051 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TO.

03:17:07.949 --> 03:17:10.752 region:rollup2
THAT IT DO THEIR BEST TO BE

03:17:09.051 --> 03:17:12.054 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE IN THE IN THE TIME

03:17:10.752 --> 03:17:14.222 region:rollup2
FRAME GIVEN AND AND.

03:17:12.054 --> 03:17:15.290 region:rollup2
AS I INDICATED EARLIER IT

03:17:14.222 --> 03:17:17.793 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM REASONABLE TO ME

03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:18.827 region:rollup2
THAT. TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME

03:17:17.793 --> 03:17:20.328 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY

03:17:18.827 --> 03:17:20.996 region:rollup2
GOES AGAINST.

03:17:20.328 --> 03:17:23.298 region:rollup2
THE PREFERENCES OF SOME OF THE

03:17:20.996 --> 03:17:24.733 region:rollup2
OTHER. AYE INTEREST INVOLVED. OF

03:17:23.298 --> 03:17:25.534 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK IT'S A IT'S A

03:17:24.733 --> 03:17:28.370 region:rollup2
IT'S

03:17:25.534 --> 03:17:29.371 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT

03:17:28.370 --> 03:17:31.506 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN BLIPS AND.

03:17:29.371 --> 03:17:33.909 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE US ALL TO

03:17:31.506 --> 03:17:35.344 region:rollup2
TO. TRY TO PROVIDE INPUT TO MOVE

03:17:33.909 --> 03:17:36.378 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS FORWARD IN A. IN A

03:17:35.344 --> 03:17:38.313 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL WAY

03:17:36.378 --> 03:17:40.282 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT MR HALL AND

03:17:38.313 --> 03:17:42.584 region:rollup2
AND I'M VERY COMFORTABLE. WITH

03:17:40.282 --> 03:17:44.453 region:rollup2
FAR YOU KNOW IRONING OUT ANY

03:17:42.584 --> 03:17:47.756 region:rollup2
WRINKLES IN THIS PROCESS WE WANT

03:17:44.453 --> 03:17:48.356 region:rollup2
TO GET THIS RIGHT. ON I I DON'T

03:17:47.756 --> 03:17:48.523 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE'S ANY REASON

03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:49.491 region:rollup2
TO.

03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:49.791 region:rollup2
.

03:17:49.491 --> 03:17:53.095 region:rollup2
TO.

03:17:49.791 --> 03:17:55.097 region:rollup2
YOU GIVE A PASSING GRADE ON

03:17:53.095 --> 03:17:57.165 region:rollup2
HOMEWORK THAT'S INCOMPLETE OR

03:17:55.097 --> 03:17:59.301 region:rollup2
DIDN'T TAT FOLLOW THEIR THEIR

03:17:57.165 --> 03:18:00.869 region:rollup2
THAT REGULATIONS. THAT WERE PUT

03:17:59.301 --> 03:18:02.771 region:rollup2
OUT AND I WOULD.

03:18:00.869 --> 03:18:04.940 region:rollup2
WARNED THE COMMISSION NOT TO DO

03:18:02.771 --> 03:18:07.109 region:rollup2
THAT IF IT YOU KNOW FELT THAT

03:18:04.940 --> 03:18:09.378 region:rollup2
THERE WAS ANY PRESSURE TO DO IT

03:18:07.109 --> 03:18:10.679 region:rollup2
I'M ONLY HERE. FOR THE PEOPLE OF

03:18:09.378 --> 03:18:12.614 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:18:10.679 --> 03:18:14.049 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT TO SAFEGUARD THIS

03:18:12.614 --> 03:18:16.451 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND THEN WE WANT TO GET

03:18:14.049 --> 03:18:18.453 region:rollup2
THE BEST WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

03:18:16.451 --> 03:18:20.155 region:rollup2
THAT OUR LIMITED RESOURCES CAN

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:21.456 region:rollup2
GET US AND MAXIMIZE THE PUBLIC

03:18:20.155 --> 03:18:23.325 region:rollup2

GOV FAIRNESS PART IS LOST

03:20:15.070 --> 03:20:18.006 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE IS NO CLEAR RUBRIC

03:20:16.338 --> 03:20:19.407 region:rollup2
SO FIRST YOU HAVE A GROUP THAT

03:20:18.006 --> 03:20:20.976 region:rollup2
IDEA LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE

03:20:19.407 --> 03:20:22.043 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY SPENT THE TIME ON IN

03:20:20.976 --> 03:20:23.411 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

03:20:22.043 --> 03:20:24.980 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS WAS IDENTIFYING

03:20:23.411 --> 03:20:26.381 region:rollup2
THOSE RUBRICS VERY CLEARLY

03:20:24.980 --> 03:20:27.749 region:rollup2
INCLUDING MODELS THAT NEEDED TO

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:28.917 region:rollup2
BE USED HAVING TO DO. WITH CLAY

03:20:27.749 --> 03:20:30.919 region:rollup2

03:20:28.917 --> 03:20:33.421 region:rollup2
IT APPLICANTS HAD TO INCLUDE

03:20:30.919 --> 03:20:33.622 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING. IN

03:20:33.421 --> 03:20:34.890 region:rollup2
THEIR.

03:20:33.622 --> 03:20:37.192 region:rollup2
AS A PART OF THEIR.

03:20:34.890 --> 03:20:38.360 region:rollup2
APPLICATION FOR THESE SORTS OF

03:20:37.192 --> 03:20:40.462 region:rollup2
FUNDS I MEAN THERE WERE THERE

03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:42.597 region:rollup2
WAS NEW IT WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY

03:20:40.462 --> 03:20:44.232 region:rollup2
NEW THINGS THAT FOLKS HAD TO DO

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:46.434 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO THESE MONEY SO.

03:20:44.232 --> 03:20:47.502 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE

03:20:46.434 --> 03:20:49.037 region:rollup2
SET UP TO DO IS TO.

03:20:47.502 --> 03:20:50.639 region:rollup2
CLARIFY RUBRICS INCLUDING

03:20:49.037 --> 03:20:51.139 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT KIND OF

03:20:50.639 --> 03:20:53.708 region:rollup2
STUDIES YOU COULD USE TO

03:20:51.139 --> 03:20:55.710 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

03:20:53.708 --> 03:20:57.913 region:rollup2
THE UNIT SUPPORT THE NUMBERS

03:20:55.710 --> 03:20:59.748 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE PUTTING IN. IN YOUR

03:20:57.913 --> 03:21:01.316 region:rollup2
APPLICATION AND SO THEN YOU

03:20:59.748 --> 03:21:02.717 region:rollup2
CREATED WE WE CREATE THE

03:21:01.316 --> 03:21:04.119 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS RIGHT BUT THEY WERE

03:21:02.717 --> 03:21:05.387 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW RIGOROUS

03:21:04.119 --> 03:21:07.455 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATIONS ARE WHEN WE

03:21:05.387 --> 03:21:09.057 region:rollup2
CREATED THEM.

03:21:07.455 --> 03:21:09.691 region:rollup2
I MEAN SO IF YOU SEE WHAT I'M

03:21:09.057 --> 03:21:11.259 region:rollup2
SAYING IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I

03:21:09.691 --> 03:21:13.161 region:rollup2
GIVE HOMEWORK. YOU KNOW I CAN'T

03:21:11.259 --> 03:21:14.262 region:rollup2
SAY ALONE THOUGH THE HOMEWORK SO

03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:15.730 region:rollup2
HARD WHEN I CREATED THE HOME.

03:21:14.262 --> 03:21:16.831 region:rollup2
FIRED THE HOMEWORK IS SO HARD TO

03:21:15.730 --> 03:21:18.266 region:rollup2
CORRECT WHEN I'M THE ONE THAT

03:21:16.831 --> 03:21:20.168 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED THE HOMEWORK AND SO

03:21:18.266 --> 03:21:21.803 region:rollup2
IT'S CONTRIBUTED A IT SEEMS

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:23.972 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTORY TO ME. THAT WE

03:21:21.803 --> 03:21:24.906 region:rollup2
CREATED THE THE THE APPLICATION

03:21:23.972 --> 03:21:26.875 region:rollup2
PROCESS BUT NOW WE'RE

03:21:24.906 --> 03:21:28.143 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW RIGOROUS

03:21:26.875 --> 03:21:30.278 region:rollup2
AND DIFFICULT THAT IS WHEN WE

03:21:28.143 --> 03:21:31.546 region:rollup2
CREATED. AND SO IF YOU'RE

03:21:30.278 --> 03:21:33.882 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING ABOUT A CAN YOU

03:21:31.546 --> 03:21:36.418 region:rollup2
IMAGINE THE APPLICANTS HOW THEY

03:21:33.882 --> 03:21:37.018 region:rollup2
FEEL BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT TO

03:21:36.418 --> 03:21:38.853 region:rollup2
REFER BACK TO THE KEY THAT

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:40.522 region:rollup2
MISTER BIGELOW WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:21:38.853 --> 03:21:42.190 region:rollup2
YOU CREATED THE KEY AS WELL. AND

03:21:40.522 --> 03:21:44.025 region:rollup2
SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:46.027 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS SO

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:47.996 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU GUYS OR WE

03:21:46.027 --> 03:21:48.363 region:rollup2
WERE THE ONES THAT CREATED THE

03:21:47.996 --> 03:21:50.332 region:rollup2
WHOLE PROCESS.

03:21:48.363 --> 03:21:52.167 region:rollup2
AND SO IS THERE A WAY TO.

03:21:50.332 --> 03:21:53.702 region:rollup2
TO CLARIFY AND REALLY GIVE.

03:21:52.167 --> 03:21:56.404 region:rollup2
AGAIN MY PICK MY WHAT I'M

03:21:53.702 --> 03:21:57.739 region:rollup2
HEARING RIGHT NOW IS THAT.

03:21:56.404 --> 03:21:59.107 region:rollup2
ONE APPLICATION IS VIEWED ONE

03:21:57.739 --> 03:21:59.874 region:rollup2
WAY ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT

03:21:59.107 --> 03:22:01.443 region:rollup2
WAY.

03:21:59.874 --> 03:22:02.911 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT MY.

03:22:01.443 --> 03:22:04.713 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OR IT'S MORE ABOUT

03:22:02.911 --> 03:22:06.147 region:rollup2
WHAT I HEARD WAS DIED YOU KNOW

03:22:04.713 --> 03:22:06.681 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S AYE AS SUCH AND SUCH

03:22:06.147 --> 03:22:07.816 region:rollup2
EXPERT THEIR VIEWING AND I

03:22:06.681 --> 03:22:09.884 region:rollup2
THINK.

03:22:07.816 --> 03:22:10.785 region:rollup2
MISTER HALL MADE THAT COMMENT

03:22:09.884 --> 03:22:12.320 region:rollup2
DIED.

03:22:10.785 --> 03:22:13.622 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENGINEERS

03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:14.589 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS AND YOU CAN LOOK

03:22:13.622 --> 03:22:16.157 region:rollup2
AT THE DIFFERENT WAYS WELL

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:19.094 region:rollup2
THERE'S A RUBRIC IT SHOULD BE

03:22:16.157 --> 03:22:20.629 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT DIFFERENTLY.

03:22:19.094 --> 03:22:22.397 region:rollup2
YEAH I AGREE AND I THINK THAT

03:22:20.629 --> 03:22:23.932 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT THAT THE ONE HOUR

03:22:22.397 --> 03:22:24.766 region:rollup2
MEETINGS RICHER YOU CAN LISTEN

03:22:23.932 --> 03:22:26.134 region:rollup2
TO THEM ONLINE YOU CAN HEAR

03:22:24.766 --> 03:22:27.202 region:rollup2
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT

03:22:26.134 --> 03:22:28.603 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHICH IS REALLY

03:22:27.202 --> 03:22:31.006 region:rollup2
INTERESTING IN THOSE MEETINGS.

03:22:28.603 --> 03:22:33.008 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU HEAR ENGINEERS FROM

03:22:31.006 --> 03:22:34.542 region:rollup2
THE APPLICANT SIDE AND FROM THE

03:22:33.008 --> 03:22:36.945 region:rollup2
STATE SIDE SAYING ó. WELL

03:22:34.542 --> 03:22:38.913 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND COMING

03:22:36.945 --> 03:22:40.648 region:rollup2
TO AN UNDERSTANDING WHICH I I

03:22:38.913 --> 03:22:42.083 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE A FAIR

03:22:40.648 --> 03:22:42.650 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE

03:22:42.083 --> 03:22:45.520 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT FILES THAT WERE

03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:46.821 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED. AND THE UPDATED

03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:48.289 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS ARE GONNA BE.

03:22:46.821 --> 03:22:50.358 region:rollup2
ALL LOT CLOSER TO THE MARK IN

03:22:48.289 --> 03:22:52.560 region:rollup2
THIS FIRST ONE. AND.

03:22:50.358 --> 03:22:54.229 region:rollup2
THEN THE FIRST BOMB DEADLINE

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:57.165 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WAS.

03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:58.666 region:rollup2
.

03:22:57.165 --> 03:23:00.301 region:rollup2
I GUESS IN THE IN THE ANALOGY OF

03:22:58.666 --> 03:23:02.871 region:rollup2
HOMEWORK THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY

03:23:00.301 --> 03:23:05.073 region:rollup2
NEW COURSE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY NEW

03:23:02.871 --> 03:23:06.608 region:rollup2
NEW CHALLENGES AND SO THAT'S WHY

03:23:05.073 --> 03:23:07.642 region:rollup2
ALSO WE HAD THE APPLICATION

03:23:06.608 --> 03:23:09.077 region:rollup2
PERIOD OPEN FOR FOUR AND A HALF

03:23:07.642 --> 03:23:10.545 region:rollup2
MONTHS WITH STAFF EQUIPMENT BUT

03:23:09.077 --> 03:23:11.513 region:rollup2
THEN THE COMITATO ALSO WAS ABOUT

03:23:10.545 --> 03:23:13.114 region:rollup2
THE FAIRNESS.

03:23:11.513 --> 03:23:15.383 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THAT IS THAT IF

03:23:13.114 --> 03:23:16.851 region:rollup2
YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU

03:23:15.383 --> 03:23:18.186 region:rollup2
KNOW ONE APPLICANT FOR EXAMPLE

03:23:16.851 --> 03:23:20.021 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT BE PERCEIVED BY

03:23:18.186 --> 03:23:21.156 region:rollup2
ANOTHER APPLICANT AS UNFAIR WELL

03:23:20.021 --> 03:23:22.424 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE DIRECT GUIDELINES

03:23:21.156 --> 03:23:23.658 region:rollup2
AND CRITERIA THAT FAIRNESS%

03:23:22.424 --> 03:23:25.860 region:rollup2
QUESTION SHOULDN'T COME INTO

03:23:23.658 --> 03:23:26.795 region:rollup2
PLAY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIRECT.

03:23:25.860 --> 03:23:28.463 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY THE REASON

03:23:26.795 --> 03:23:29.898 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING TELL THIS PERSON IS

03:23:28.463 --> 03:23:31.399 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS. YOU KNOW

03:23:29.898 --> 03:23:32.667 region:rollup2
EXPLAINS THE.

03:23:31.399 --> 03:23:34.436 region:rollup2
THE SOLES SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:36.538 region:rollup2
THAT PART ABOUT WHY IT WOULD BE

03:23:34.436 --> 03:23:37.839 region:rollup2
UNFAIR TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. IF

03:23:36.538 --> 03:23:39.574 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION IS CLEAR AND

03:23:37.839 --> 03:23:40.942 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT THEN THERE SHOULD BE

03:23:39.574 --> 03:23:44.012 region:rollup2
NO QUESTION AS TO THE FURNACE

03:23:40.942 --> 03:23:45.146 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALL WRITTEN IN THE

03:23:44.012 --> 03:23:46.281 region:rollup2
APPLICATION ORINDA AND THE

03:23:45.146 --> 03:23:47.582 region:rollup2
STATUTE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL

03:23:46.281 --> 03:23:49.217 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE THINKING

03:23:47.582 --> 03:23:50.752 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND.

03:23:49.217 --> 03:23:51.820 region:rollup2
MY MY CALLED EXECUTIVE OFFICER

03:23:50.752 --> 03:23:53.221 region:rollup2
UP AGAIN.

03:23:51.820 --> 03:23:55.690 region:rollup2
YOU WOULDN'T MIND JOE.

03:23:53.221 --> 03:23:57.625 region:rollup2
.

03:23:55.690 --> 03:23:58.760 region:rollup2
WHAT I?

03:23:57.625 --> 03:24:00.095 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT HAPPENS PRESS IS

03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:01.496 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT

03:24:00.095 --> 03:24:03.665 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN HANDED IS THAT THIS

03:24:01.496 --> 03:24:05.366 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.

03:24:03.665 --> 03:24:07.202 region:rollup2
IT'S HOW DO WE KEEP HOW DO WE

03:24:05.366 --> 03:24:08.870 region:rollup2
KEEP THAT COMPETITIVE. PART OF

03:24:07.202 --> 03:24:10.071 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IN PLACE AT THE SAME

03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:11.940 region:rollup2
TIME THAT WERE ASSISTING

03:24:10.071 --> 03:24:13.341 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS AND THAT'S BEEN THE

03:24:11.940 --> 03:24:14.576 region:rollup2
JUNGLE I THINK THAT'S PART THE

03:24:13.341 --> 03:24:15.043 region:rollup2
JUNGLE FOR US.

03:24:14.576 --> 03:24:17.345 region:rollup2
AND.

03:24:15.043 --> 03:24:18.646 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THE OTHER PRESSURE

03:24:17.345 --> 03:24:19.881 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IS MEETING THE TIME

03:24:18.646 --> 03:24:21.583 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN.

03:24:19.881 --> 03:24:22.951 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ME I I THINK WE ALL

03:24:21.583 --> 03:24:24.219 region:rollup2
WOULD OF LOVED TO HAVE SEEN

03:24:22.951 --> 03:24:26.287 region:rollup2

03:26:51.833 --> 03:26:54.369 region:rollup2
AND I WILL I THINK WE WE GET THE

03:26:53.368 --> 03:26:55.303 region:rollup2
POINT WHAT AND I'D LIKE TO SAY

03:26:54.369 --> 03:26:57.338 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE ALL

03:26:55.303 --> 03:26:58.740 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IT WASN'T LIKE EVERY

03:26:57.338 --> 03:26:59.574 region:rollup2
APPLICATION AT THE SAME.

03:26:58.740 --> 03:27:01.142 region:rollup2
THAT THE SAME DISCONNECT IT WAS

03:26:59.574 --> 03:27:02.644 region:rollup2
IT WAS.

03:27:01.142 --> 03:27:04.412 region:rollup2
IT WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT ON

03:27:02.644 --> 03:27:06.281 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND AND BELIEVE ME I

03:27:04.412 --> 03:27:07.749 region:rollup2
REALLY DO FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY IS

03:27:06.281 --> 03:27:09.284 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS WANTS

03:27:07.749 --> 03:27:11.019 region:rollup2
IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WANT

03:27:09.284 --> 03:27:12.453 region:rollup2
MONEY TO GO OUT THE DOOR AND WE

03:27:11.019 --> 03:27:14.155 region:rollup2
WANT TO GET OUT. AS SOON AS

03:27:12.453 --> 03:27:15.356 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND I MIGHT ADD WITH

03:27:14.155 --> 03:27:16.658 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE

03:27:15.356 --> 03:27:17.692 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S I THINK THE THING

03:27:16.658 --> 03:27:19.260 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS

03:27:17.692 --> 03:27:20.428 region:rollup2
THE CONFIDENCE.

03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:21.796 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONFIDENCE FOR THE

03:27:20.428 --> 03:27:23.164 region:rollup2
APPLICATION RIGHT IN AND I

03:27:21.796 --> 03:27:24.933 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE WORKING

03:27:23.164 --> 03:27:25.533 region:rollup2
HARD AGAIN I THINK WHERE MY. MY

03:27:24.933 --> 03:27:26.868 region:rollup2
HEAD THAT KEEPS GOING BACK TO

03:27:25.533 --> 03:27:28.536 region:rollup2
IS.

03:27:26.868 --> 03:27:30.004 region:rollup2
I'M.

03:27:28.536 --> 03:27:31.940 region:rollup2
IF WE CREATED THE PROCESS SHOULD

03:27:30.004 --> 03:27:33.741 region:rollup2
BE THAT COMPLICATED TO BE ABLE

03:27:31.940 --> 03:27:35.777 region:rollup2
TO TO CHECK THE HOMEWORK.

03:27:33.741 --> 03:27:37.478 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF WE CREATED THAN WE

03:27:35.777 --> 03:27:39.314 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA SHOULD BE

03:27:37.478 --> 03:27:39.480 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GO TO A CLASS YOU GET

03:27:39.314 --> 03:27:40.782 region:rollup2
ON.

03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:41.416 region:rollup2
.

03:27:40.782 --> 03:27:42.650 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY YOU GET THE

03:27:41.416 --> 03:27:43.952 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE PROFESSOR

03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:45.620 region:rollup2
AS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR

03:27:43.952 --> 03:27:46.888 region:rollup2
THAT CLASS IN EIGHT SOMEHOW IT

03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:49.357 region:rollup2
JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S

03:27:46.888 --> 03:27:49.891 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CASE HERE. AND SO WE

03:27:49.357 --> 03:27:50.925 region:rollup2
CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND AND

03:27:49.891 --> 03:27:52.060 region:rollup2
ROUND.

03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:52.994 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT

03:27:52.060 --> 03:27:55.530 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM THAT THE

03:27:52.994 --> 03:27:57.198 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS. IS IS.

03:27:55.530 --> 03:27:58.032 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO FOR US TO

03:27:57.198 --> 03:28:00.368 region:rollup2
KEEP

03:27:58.032 --> 03:28:02.303 region:rollup2
UP YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO TO THE

03:28:00.368 --> 03:28:04.772 region:rollup2
SAME THING IF IT WAS WE WOULDN'T

03:28:02.303 --> 03:28:06.307 region:rollup2
HAVE NINE THOUSAND. ARE

03:28:04.772 --> 03:28:07.108 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONS I GUESS AND I PLEASE

03:28:06.307 --> 03:28:08.910 region:rollup2
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT IT JUST

03:28:07.108 --> 03:28:11.913 region:rollup2
MIGHT JUST I ALSO SAY THAT THE

03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:12.347 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE REGULATIONS

03:28:11.913 --> 03:28:13.014 region:rollup2
WAS COLLABORATIVE.

03:28:12.347 --> 03:28:14.716 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REALLY WERE EVERYTHING

03:28:13.014 --> 03:28:16.351 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN THE

03:28:14.716 --> 03:28:18.286 region:rollup2
PUBLIC. IN THE PUBLIC ARENA.

03:28:16.351 --> 03:28:20.888 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATED AND IT

03:28:18.286 --> 03:28:22.123 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN A VERY OPEN

03:28:20.888 --> 03:28:23.825 region:rollup2
PROCESS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:28:22.123 --> 03:28:26.160 region:rollup2
I'M ABOUT THE PROCESS IS OPEN

03:28:23.825 --> 03:28:28.029 region:rollup2
BUTWE HERE WE ARE. I MEAN AND

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:28.896 region:rollup2
SO I REALLY DIDN'T AND SO BY TWO

03:28:28.029 --> 03:28:29.864 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

03:28:28.896 --> 03:28:30.998 region:rollup2
GIVING ME THAT HE NEEDED

03:28:29.864 --> 03:28:31.899 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE QUESTIONS I WILL BE

03:28:30.998 --> 03:28:33.735 region:rollup2
ASKING MORE QUESTIONS BUT THE

03:28:31.899 --> 03:28:37.405 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SIGN ME UP ON THAT

03:28:33.735 --> 03:28:38.840 region:rollup2

03:28:37.405 --> 03:28:40.174 region:rollup2
AS A AS A VOTER.

03:28:38.840 --> 03:28:41.509 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU VOTE FOR SOMETHING AND

03:28:40.174 --> 03:28:43.277 region:rollup2
IT'S TAKING FOUR YEARS FOR A TO

COME TO FRUITION AND IT'S A KIND

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:46.180 region:rollup2
OF I'M. KIND OF.

03:28:44.746 --> 03:28:47.415 region:rollup2
.

03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:48.950 region:rollup2
LEAVES ME SHELLSHOCKED ABOUT

03:28:47.415 --> 03:28:50.852 region:rollup2
VOTE FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF IT'S

03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:51.019 region:rollup2

I.

03:28:51.019 --> 03:28:54.188 region:rollup2
WHEN I VOTED WAS TO MOVE THIS

I'M NOT ENCOURAGED TO VOTE ON

03:28:57.225 --> 03:28:59.794 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEN THEN

03:28:59.093 --> 03:29:01.062 region:rollup2

03:28:59.794 --> 03:29:03.297 region:rollup2
REPUTATION OF ALL THE BURKE

03:29:01.062 --> 03:29:05.266 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY AND. YOU KNOW YOU

DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SUPPORT

03:29:06.334 --> 03:29:09.537 region:rollup2
OTHER.

03:29:07.402 --> 03:29:10.138 region:rollup2
BONDS IF THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA

03:29:09.537 --> 03:29:11.339 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

03:29:10.138 --> 03:29:14.342 region:rollup2

LINES IN AN AREA THAT. I'M QUITE

03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:37.732 region:rollup2
PROUD OF OUR AGRICULTURAL ROOTS.

03:29:35.329 --> 03:29:39.700 region:rollup2
AND ITS NOT LOST ON ME THAT MANY

03:29:37.732 --> 03:29:41.135 region:rollup2
OF THE PLAYERS WHO YOU MENTIONED

03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:43.438 region:rollup2
BEFORE THAT WE WERE NOT

03:29:41.135 --> 03:29:45.773 region:rollup2
INCLUDING. THOSE WHO ACTUALLY

03:29:43.438 --> 03:29:47.909 region:rollup2
WORKED IN THE FIELDS AND THOSE

03:29:45.773 --> 03:29:56.184 region:rollup2
WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A VOICE.

03:29:47.909 --> 03:29:57.151 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE IT'S MY OBLIGATION

03:29:56.184 --> 03:29:58.853 region:rollup2
TO

03:29:57.151 --> 03:30:00.154 region:rollup2
COULD BECAUSE YOU WORK QUITE

SIGNING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND I

03:30:03.091 --> 03:30:06.394 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUND IN THIS BUILDING THAT

03:30:04.559 --> 03:30:08.563 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE. QUICK TO TAKE

03:30:06.394 --> 03:30:10.097 region:rollup2
PICTURES AND RIBBON CUTTINGS BUT

03:30:08.563 --> 03:30:12.400 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION

03:30:10.097 --> 03:30:14.001 region:rollup2
AND APPLICATIONS OF THE LAWS

03:30:12.400 --> 03:30:14.769 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DULY IMPORTANT.

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:16.137 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO GET AN

03:30:14.769 --> 03:30:18.139 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING FROM YOU

03:30:16.137 --> 03:30:20.942 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY IF I CAN.

03:30:18.139 --> 03:30:22.810 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE INTENT OF SPEAKING

03:30:20.942 --> 03:30:25.646 region:rollup2
ABOUT CONVEYANCE?

03:30:22.810 --> 03:30:27.515 region:rollup2
IS THERE A CHANGE IN WHAT WAS

03:30:25.646 --> 03:30:28.916 region:rollup2
VOTED ON IN TWENTY FOURTEEN.

03:30:27.515 --> 03:30:30.818 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:30:28.916 --> 03:30:32.286 region:rollup2
ANY NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS THAT

03:30:30.818 --> 03:30:34.222 region:rollup2
MAY COME.

03:30:32.286 --> 03:30:36.357 region:rollup2
FORWARD FROM HERE ARE WE

03:30:34.222 --> 03:30:38.593 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING CONVEYANCE IN OUR

03:30:36.357 --> 03:30:39.927 region:rollup2
CURRENT APPLICATIONS AND WHAT

03:30:38.593 --> 03:30:41.662 region:rollup2
ROLE DOES THAT PLAY INTO. WHO IS

03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:43.364 region:rollup2
SELECTED?

03:30:41.662 --> 03:30:45.900 region:rollup2
SECOND QUESTION IS GOING TO BE

03:30:43.364 --> 03:30:48.503 region:rollup2
FOR YOU CHAIRMAN CAN TEAR.

03:30:45.900 --> 03:30:50.104 region:rollup2

WHAT YOU SAID AND.

03:30:50.104 --> 03:30:53.641 region:rollup2
I'M YOU KNOW I'VE I HAVE NOT

03:30:51.639 --> 03:30:55.176 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT QUOTE BEFORE IN GOD

03:30:53.641 --> 03:30:57.145 region:rollup2
WE TRUST AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE

03:30:55.176 --> 03:30:58.813 region:rollup2
WE NEED DATA. I'VE HEARD IT

03:30:57.145 --> 03:31:00.515 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED THAT WATER IS A MATTER

03:30:58.813 --> 03:31:02.116 region:rollup2
OF FAITH.

03:31:00.515 --> 03:31:03.451 region:rollup2
I COME FROM THE VALLEY AND FOR

03:31:02.116 --> 03:31:05.686 region:rollup2
US I'D ACTUALLY LIKE MARK

03:31:03.451 --> 03:31:08.089 region:rollup2
TWAIN'S QUOTE THERE LIES DAMNED

03:31:05.686 --> 03:31:09.323 region:rollup2
LIES AND STATISTICS.

03:31:08.089 --> 03:31:10.992 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS A

03:31:09.323 --> 03:31:12.793 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT BETWEEN DEFINITIONS

03:31:10.992 --> 03:31:14.495 region:rollup2
AND OUTCOMES YOU'VE SAID THAT.

03:31:12.793 --> 03:31:16.097 region:rollup2
WERE APPLYING THE STANDARDS AS

03:31:14.495 --> 03:31:18.032 region:rollup2
THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD.

03:31:16.097 --> 03:31:20.067 region:rollup2
BUT AS WE ARE CARVING A NEW PATH

03:31:18.032 --> 03:31:22.770 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

03:31:20.067 --> 03:31:25.039 region:rollup2
HOW? CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

03:31:22.770 --> 03:31:27.275 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS AS IT'S CURRENTLY

03:31:25.039 --> 03:31:28.543 region:rollup2
BEING. PUT FORWARD IF THIS WAS A

03:31:27.275 --> 03:31:30.578 region:rollup2
NEW COURSE.

03:31:28.543 --> 03:31:32.980 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE HAVING NEW CHALLENGES

03:31:30.578 --> 03:31:35.583 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE CONTINUE THIS COURSE.

03:31:32.980 --> 03:31:38.319 region:rollup2
EVERYONE FAILED THE FIRST TEST.

03:31:35.583 --> 03:31:38.886 region:rollup2
IS THAT ON THE APPLICANTS

03:31:38.319 --> 03:31:40.421 region:rollup2
OR ON THE PERSON GIVING THE

03:31:38.886 --> 03:31:42.156 region:rollup2
TEST.

03:31:40.421 --> 03:31:43.824 region:rollup2
SO HOW CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE

03:31:42.156 --> 03:31:45.259 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD THAT WERE

03:31:43.824 --> 03:31:50.765 region:rollup2
PERFORMING TO THE UP MOST OF OUR

03:31:45.259 --> 03:31:53.267 region:rollup2
ABILITIES.

03:31:50.765 --> 03:31:55.169 region:rollup2
SO TO THE FIRST QUESTION AND I

03:31:53.267 --> 03:31:57.972 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. ON THE

03:31:55.169 --> 03:31:59.173 region:rollup2
CAN ON CONVEYANCE AND I BELIEVE

03:31:57.972 --> 03:32:00.875 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVEYANCE

03:31:59.173 --> 03:32:02.610 region:rollup2
IN THE VALLEY NOT.

03:32:00.875 --> 03:32:04.178 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT TALKING ACROSS THE

03:32:02.610 --> 03:32:06.914 region:rollup2
DELTA SO OKAY.

03:32:04.178 --> 03:32:07.648 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MAY

03:32:06.914 --> 03:32:09.450 region:rollup2
SELECT SITES

03:32:07.648 --> 03:32:11.886 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:32:09.450 --> 03:32:14.488 region:rollup2
I LOOK FORWARD TO POTENTIALS FOR

03:32:11.886 --> 03:32:16.157 region:rollup2
CONVEYANCE WITHOUT JUDGING WHAT

03:32:14.488 --> 03:32:18.326 region:rollup2
WAS PUT IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS

03:32:16.157 --> 03:32:20.328 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT WE NEED

03:32:18.326 --> 03:32:21.762 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DECISIONS

03:32:20.328 --> 03:32:23.764 region:rollup2
ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONE VOTERS

03:32:21.762 --> 03:32:26.801 region:rollup2
INITIALLY VOTED ON IT AND NOT

03:32:23.764 --> 03:32:28.002 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

03:32:26.801 --> 03:32:29.971 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:32:28.002 --> 03:32:31.706 region:rollup2
CONVEYANCE IN THE DELTA OKAY. ON

03:32:29.971 --> 03:32:33.307 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION I

03:32:31.706 --> 03:32:33.774 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

03:32:33.307 --> 03:32:37.044 region:rollup2
WAS.

03:32:33.774 --> 03:32:39.413 region:rollup2
VERY CAREFUL BOTH ON

03:32:37.044 --> 03:32:41.415 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT I.

03:32:39.413 --> 03:32:43.417 region:rollup2
WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN

03:32:41.415 --> 03:32:45.686 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEY WERE

03:32:43.417 --> 03:32:48.656 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:50.391 region:rollup2
FUNDING WASN'T. GOING FOR FOR

03:32:48.656 --> 03:32:52.460 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE TUNNELS PROJECT

03:32:50.391 --> 03:32:54.195 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT WAS AN EXPLICIT

03:32:52.460 --> 03:32:55.796 region:rollup2
PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND I

03:32:54.195 --> 03:32:58.766 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE. THAT WAS

03:32:55.796 --> 03:33:01.836 region:rollup2
RESOLVED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN.

03:32:58.766 --> 03:33:03.871 region:rollup2
SO CAN WE SAY THAN THAT.

03:33:01.836 --> 03:33:06.507 region:rollup2
ANY POTENTIALS FOR WATER FIX OUR

03:33:03.871 --> 03:33:08.909 region:rollup2
NOT BEING CONSIDERED AND.

03:33:06.507 --> 03:33:10.411 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS ARE WE EXPLICITLY

03:33:08.909 --> 03:33:13.247 region:rollup2
EXCLUDING.

03:33:10.411 --> 03:33:15.549 region:rollup2
THAT AS A DECISION FACTOR.

03:33:13.247 --> 03:33:16.684 region:rollup2
IS IT BASED ON WHAT WAS IN

03:33:15.549 --> 03:33:18.753 region:rollup2
FRONT OF US IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

03:33:16.684 --> 03:33:20.788 region:rollup2
OR IS THIS A MOVING TARGET.

03:33:18.753 --> 03:33:22.056 region:rollup2
I I DEFER TO THE COMMISSION ON

03:33:20.788 --> 03:33:23.891 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS BASED ON WHAT WAS IN

03:33:22.056 --> 03:33:25.559 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE OF THE LEGISLATION

03:33:23.891 --> 03:33:26.527 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S THE ONLY

03:33:25.559 --> 03:33:28.696 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE CAN FOLLOW WE

03:33:26.527 --> 03:33:30.197 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE NEW TARGETS OR IDEAS.

03:33:28.696 --> 03:33:32.400 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING PRETTY.

03:33:30.197 --> 03:33:33.968 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD.

03:33:32.400 --> 03:33:36.837 region:rollup2
MAYWEATHER CRAFTERS OF ALL THIS.

03:33:33.968 --> 03:33:39.240 region:rollup2
.

03:33:36.837 --> 03:33:40.908 region:rollup2
GOOD OR BAD THAT THE PROJECTS

03:33:39.240 --> 03:33:42.843 region:rollup2
WERE LIMITED TO ONLY THE.

03:33:40.908 --> 03:33:44.345 region:rollup2
PROJECTS OF RECORD A DECISION.

03:33:42.843 --> 03:33:46.047 region:rollup2
FOR THE CHAPTER A CONSIDERATION

03:33:44.345 --> 03:33:48.482 region:rollup2
SO WHATEVER WAS IN THE RECORD.

03:33:46.047 --> 03:33:49.717 region:rollup2
DECISION IS WHAT PROJECTS.

03:33:48.482 --> 03:33:51.352 region:rollup2
WE'RE ABLE BE STUDIED AND

03:33:49.717 --> 03:33:53.354 region:rollup2
UTILIZED AND RECOGNIZED.

03:33:51.352 --> 03:33:54.622 region:rollup2
VOTED FOR YOUR ANSWER.

03:33:53.354 --> 03:33:56.891 region:rollup2
SO IT IT MAY HAVE BEEN EXPANDED

03:33:54.622 --> 03:33:57.958 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN BUT TECHNICALLY THEY

03:33:56.891 --> 03:33:59.660 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

03:33:57.958 --> 03:34:01.362 region:rollup2
A SEPARATE DISCUSSION.

03:33:59.660 --> 03:34:03.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT BEING DISCUSSED HERE

03:34:01.362 --> 03:34:05.066 region:rollup2
TODAY. AND. THE REASON WHY I

03:34:03.798 --> 03:34:06.801 region:rollup2
BRING IT UP AS I KNOW THIS IS A

03:34:05.066 --> 03:34:08.336 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND WHILE I

03:34:06.801 --> 03:34:10.137 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH MY VICE

03:34:08.336 --> 03:34:11.572 region:rollup2
CHAIR ON EXACTLY WHERE THE

03:34:10.137 --> 03:34:13.641 region:rollup2
STORAGE PROJECTS ARE.

03:34:11.572 --> 03:34:14.875 region:rollup2
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT

03:34:13.641 --> 03:34:16.644 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF OUR WATER RESTORED

03:34:14.875 --> 03:34:19.413 region:rollup2
NORTH OF THE DELTA.

03:34:16.644 --> 03:34:21.449 region:rollup2
AND IF WE LACK CONVEYANCE NOW.

03:34:19.413 --> 03:34:23.651 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE CONSIDERING FUTURE

03:34:21.449 --> 03:34:26.053 region:rollup2
PROJECTS NORTH OF THE DELTA

03:34:23.651 --> 03:34:27.621 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T WE LOOK AT AS A STATE

03:34:26.053 --> 03:34:29.123 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NECESSARY? FOR OUR

03:34:27.621 --> 03:34:31.092 region:rollup2
CURRENT

03:34:29.123 --> 03:34:32.093 region:rollup2
STATE OF CONVEYANCE AS WORD

03:34:31.092 --> 03:34:33.761 region:rollup2
DECIDING MAJOR PROJECTS LIKE

03:34:32.093 --> 03:34:35.696 region:rollup2
THIS

03:34:33.761 --> 03:34:37.398 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS REALLY MY INTENT OF

03:34:35.696 --> 03:34:39.033 region:rollup2
THAT FIRST QUESTION. BUT I'D

03:34:37.398 --> 03:34:40.835 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE TO GET A SENSE OF I

03:34:39.033 --> 03:34:42.903 region:rollup2
CAN HOW DO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE.

03:34:40.835 --> 03:34:44.438 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE LOOK AT THIS PATH

03:34:42.903 --> 03:34:45.906 region:rollup2
FORWARD AS BEING ONE THAT NEEDS

03:34:44.438 --> 03:34:48.743 region:rollup2
TO BE REPLICATED?

03:34:45.906 --> 03:34:50.711 region:rollup2
THAT IS WORTHY OF US WHEN WE

03:34:48.743 --> 03:34:51.245 region:rollup2
HAVE AS MANY QUESTIONS AS WE'RE

03:34:50.711 --> 03:34:53.147 region:rollup2
SEEING RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE

03:34:51.245 --> 03:34:54.248 region:rollup2

I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A PART

03:36:48.729 --> 03:36:53.133 region:rollup2
OF OUR PROCESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY

03:36:50.931 --> 03:36:54.568 region:rollup2

SMART PATHWAY FORWARD FOR WATER

03:37:10.184 --> 03:37:14.688 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA.

CENTS IF I CAN.

03:37:15.055 --> 03:37:18.092 region:rollup2
.

03:37:16.357 --> 03:37:21.061 region:rollup2
NO WE HEARD ABOUT THE NECESSITY

03:37:18.092 --> 03:37:23.197 region:rollup2
FOR THE SYNERGISTIC BENEFITS OF

IT'S SAD IN A WAY THAT I WAS NOT

03:37:28.602 --> 03:37:33.908 region:rollup2
HERE TO HELP AT A VOICE TO THE

03:37:31.472 --> 03:37:34.475 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED BY

03:37:33.908 --> 03:37:35.743 region:rollup2
THE DECISIONS THAT ARE HERE

03:37:34.475 --> 03:37:38.312 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

03:37:35.743 --> 03:37:39.346 region:rollup2
WORKING IN AN ER I SAW PEOPLE'S

03:37:38.312 --> 03:37:41.015 region:rollup2
LIVES THAT WERE SHORTENED

03:37:39.346 --> 03:37:43.150 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS DROUGHT.

03:37:41.015 --> 03:37:46.120 region:rollup2
AND I AM DOWN.

03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:46.987 region:rollup2
A BIT DISTURBED TO SAY THAT.

03:37:46.120 --> 03:37:48.622 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING THEIR

03:37:46.987 --> 03:37:50.791 region:rollup2
VOICES

03:37:48.622 --> 03:37:53.627 region:rollup2
AND REALLY LISTENING TO WEAR

03:37:50.791 --> 03:37:55.296 region:rollup2
PROJECTS NEED TO HAVE STORAGE IN

03:37:53.627 --> 03:37:56.397 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BENEFITING.

03:37:55.296 --> 03:37:58.432 region:rollup2
THOSE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES

03:37:56.397 --> 03:38:00.734 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE DISADVANTAGES.

03:37:58.432 --> 03:38:02.569 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYONE HAS A VOICE OR CAN

03:38:00.734 --> 03:38:04.305 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

03:38:02.569 --> 03:38:06.173 region:rollup2
BUT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE

03:38:04.305 --> 03:38:07.708 region:rollup2
HEARD AS WELL AND I HOPE WHEN

03:38:06.173 --> 03:38:10.311 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS

03:38:07.708 --> 03:38:12.379 region:rollup2
THAT YOU TRULY DO. CONSIDER ALL

03:38:10.311 --> 03:38:12.880 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS INSTEAD OF.

03:38:12.379 --> 03:38:14.415 region:rollup2
.

03:38:12.880 --> 03:38:16.417 region:rollup2
AND.

03:38:14.415 --> 03:38:18.252 region:rollup2
SIMPLY.

03:38:16.417 --> 03:38:20.554 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW SOME.

03:38:18.252 --> 03:38:22.122 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I. LOOK FORWARD TO THE

03:38:20.554 --> 03:38:24.758 region:rollup2
END OF THIS COURSE.

03:38:22.122 --> 03:38:26.727 region:rollup2
BUT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE.

03:50:24.577 --> 03:50:28.415 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT

03:50:25.912 --> 03:50:29.249 region:rollup2
THEM THIS YEAR BUT. MAYBE NOT IN

03:50:28.415 --> 03:50:31.384 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS.

03:50:29.249 --> 03:50:32.452 region:rollup2
SO IT IS VERY NEW PROGRAM THAT

03:50:31.384 --> 03:50:34.387 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN

03:50:32.452 --> 03:50:35.989 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING AND THEY ARE.

03:50:34.387 --> 03:50:37.257 region:rollup2
BEING REALLY INNOVATIVE AYE IN

03:50:35.989 --> 03:50:39.092 region:rollup2
ITS APPROACH AND I THINK THAT

03:50:37.257 --> 03:50:40.427 region:rollup2
DOES EXPLAIN A LOT OF SOME OF

03:50:39.092 --> 03:50:42.062 region:rollup2
THE HIT UPSET ABOUT HAPPENING.

03:50:40.427 --> 03:50:43.129 region:rollup2
ITS ENTIRELY NEW.

03:50:42.062 --> 03:50:44.531 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT'S FOR A LOT OF

03:50:43.129 --> 03:50:45.799 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HADN'T SEEN IT BEFORE OB

03:50:44.531 --> 03:50:47.367 region:rollup2
I THINK.

03:50:45.799 --> 03:50:48.635 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I AGREE THAT.

03:50:47.367 --> 03:50:49.436 region:rollup2
AFTER LISTENING INTO THOSE OF

03:50:48.635 --> 03:50:50.470 region:rollup2
THOSE MEETINGS THAT WERE

03:50:49.436 --> 03:50:52.906 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN FEBRUARY THAT THE

03:50:50.470 --> 03:50:54.674 region:rollup2
PROCESS WILL NOT IMPROVE OVER

03:50:52.906 --> 03:50:57.177 region:rollup2
THE INITIAL PUBLIC BENEFIT. ROB

03:50:54.674 --> 03:50:59.079 region:rollup2

03:51:02.182 --> 03:51:04.417 region:rollup2

APPROPRIATE THINGS.

03:51:08.588 --> 03:51:11.958 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST BY HAVING STATE

03:51:10.623 --> 03:51:13.560 region:rollup2
AGENCIES PROVIDING.

03:51:11.958 --> 03:51:16.229 region:rollup2

WE THINK THE STATE AGENCIES DO

03:51:20.500 --> 03:51:22.902 region:rollup2
HAVE A JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:51:21.634 --> 03:51:24.404 region:rollup2
THESE BENEFITS MATERIALIZE THAT

03:51:22.902 --> 03:51:25.605 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE SPENT

03:51:58.037 --> 03:52:00.707 region:rollup2
HELPFUL FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE

03:52:12.852 --> 03:52:15.889 region:rollup2
NO I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT'S

03:52:14.754 --> 03:52:18.391 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT

03:52:15.889 --> 03:52:18.992 region:rollup2
THERE'S A HISTORY OF THE STATE

03:52:18.391 --> 03:52:19.659 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL

03:52:18.992 --> 03:52:21.394 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

03:52:19.659 --> 03:52:22.929 region:rollup2

DID NOT OCCUR.

03:52:28.368 --> 03:52:31.771 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE BIG

03:52:30.336 --> 03:52:34.908 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECTS WERE IN LARGE

03:52:31.771 --> 03:52:36.676 region:rollup2
PART JUSTIFIED A BY THE INTENT

03:52:34.908 --> 03:52:38.378 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE A GROUNDWATER

03:52:36.676 --> 03:52:40.079 region:rollup2
OVERDRAFT. HOW THAT WORKED OUT?

03:52:38.378 --> 03:52:43.716 region:rollup2
?

03:52:40.079 --> 03:52:45.018 region:rollup2
A PREVIOUS BONTA MONEY HAS BEEN

03:52:43.716 --> 03:52:46.653 region:rollup2

RECEIVE PUBLIC ABOUT MONEY FOR

03:52:50.123 --> 03:52:52.692 region:rollup2
FOR BENEFITS BUT WE NEVER REALLY

03:52:52.158 --> 03:52:53.593 region:rollup2
DEFINE WHAT THOSE BENEFITS

03:52:52.692 --> 03:52:55.228 region:rollup2
WHERE.

03:52:53.593 --> 03:52:56.763 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT

03:52:55.228 --> 03:52:57.831 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE REALLY GOT ADDITIONAL

03:52:56.763 --> 03:52:59.432 region:rollup2

THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IS

03:53:10.944 --> 03:53:13.446 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING BUT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:53:12.512 --> 03:53:17.050 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN

03:53:13.446 --> 03:53:18.918 region:rollup2
DONE BEFORE? AND PREVENT OF THE.

03:53:17.050 --> 03:53:21.087 region:rollup2
WASTE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

03:53:18.918 --> 03:53:22.989 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT A LOVE FOR PUBLIC

03:53:21.087 --> 03:53:24.424 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT MIGHT BE JUST

03:53:22.989 --> 03:53:25.458 region:rollup2
ICING ON THE CAKE FOR SOMETHING

03:53:24.424 --> 03:53:27.126 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD PAY FOR

03:53:25.458 --> 03:53:28.795 region:rollup2

PROCESS THAT WE'VE DONE.

03:53:37.303 --> 03:53:40.006 region:rollup2
DESIGNED.

03:53:38.238 --> 03:53:42.041 region:rollup2
THE OTHER POINT I'D MAKE A AND

03:53:40.006 --> 03:53:42.609 region:rollup2

IS THAT.

03:53:47.013 --> 03:53:50.550 region:rollup2
I I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE

03:53:48.414 --> 03:53:52.385 region:rollup2
AN OBJECTION TO IMPROVING THE

03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:53.620 region:rollup2
