WELCOME TO THE FIRST EVER SELECT COMMITTEE. ON THE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND I WELCOME EVERYONE TO THIS FIRST MEETING OF THE SISTINE GROUP -- I SEE I HAVE TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE ALREADY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND WE HOPE TO HAVE SOME OTHER SIMPLY MEMBERS JOINING. AND TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOU ARE IN THE CORRECT ROOM -- I'M JUST GONNA LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED HAS BEEN. REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AS A HAS BEEN TO TO MY COLLEAGUES -- ARE. I PROBABLY HAVE MENTIONED THIS SEVERAL TIMES IN SEVERAL MEETINGS AND MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN. THAT I'VE BEEN TO MORE PRISONS THAN I'VE EVER WANTED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE -- AND AS I TALK TO THESE INDIVIDUALS ABOUT. ABOUT HOW THEY GOT. INTO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE -- SEEM LIKE IT WAS A VERY CLEAR PATH. THAT IS -- NOT ONLY WELL KNOWN BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IS IS AN INSIDIOUS IN NATURE. AND IT'S AND DELIBERATE -- UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ALSO RESULTED. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AFTER AMERICAN LATINOS NATIVE AMERICAN AND SOME. API. ATKINS BEING THRUST INTO THE PRISON PIPELINE. WHICH I LIKE TO CALL THE PRISON PAL PLANTATION WHICH IS REPLACED PLANTATIONS OF THE OF SLAVERY TIME. AND ONCE YOU'RE IN. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO LEAD A FULL LIFE. AND WE HAVE NOT PRESENTED -- WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT A TIME OUT OF IT? AND EVERY TIME I'VE MET THESE -- THESE INDIVIDUALS -- A LOT OF THEM HAVE SAID I WISH THERE WAS SOMEONE. THAT I CARED FOR ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER -- I THE STORY I'D LIKE TO TELL AS WELL AS A ROOM FULL OF AFTER AMERICAN. MALES -- AND THEY WITH THEIR BOYS TO MEN OF COLOR THEY WERE THERE TO TALK ALL THESE ADULTS. THE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AND THEY HAD A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN YOUNG MEN. THAT WERE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. AND ONE OF THEM GOT UP. AND SAID THAT -- OF THE REASON THAT I ENDED UP IN JAIL INCARCERATED SO LONG IS BECAUSE NO ONE LISTEN TO ME. AND OF COURSE ALL THESE MEN GOT UP TO READ DOCTORS LAWYERS AT PH DIS. VERY WELL EDUCATED PEOPLE AT ELECTED OFFICIALS GET UP AND SAID WE CARE WE CARE. AND HE SAID NO. NO ONE LISTENS TO ME. AND IT KIND OF TOOK US ALL A BACK LIKE WHEN. OF COURSE WE DO IN IN WHICH WE WE KNEW ABOUT ASUS WE KNEW ABOUT THIS WHEN WE HAD ALL THESE TECHNICAL TERMS WE KNEW ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING. AND THIS ONE OLDER GENTLEMAN WHEN UP? AND STOOD IN FRONT THIS YOUNG MAN AND SAID -- I HEAR YOU. AND THEN HE GAVE ME A HUG. AND HE SAID I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE SMART [inaudible] DAD YOU. ARE GIFTED AND YOU ARE YOU ARE SOMEONE THAT WILL BE -- EVAN CAGES TO THIS COMMUNITY AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU. AND THAT YOUNG MAN BROKE DOWN AND STARTED CRYING. AND THAT I WOULD BE SURE WHAT TO DO MOST THE MEN WEREN'T SURE WHAT TO DO. BEFORE I NOTICE. THERE WAS. WE SEE GROWN AFTER AMERICAN LATINO MEN STARTING TO CRY IN A ROOM -- YOU REALIZE WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS NO ONE SEES ME. SO NO ONE HEARS ME. AND WHEN I TELL PEOPLE MY PAIN. NO ONE HEARS ME AND NO ONE SEES ME AND WHEN HE GOT THE MIKE BACK -- BUT THE THING THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME HE WAS IT WAS LIKE NINETEEN YEARS OLD. AND HE SAID IT WAS THE FIRST TIME. ANY MAN OF COLOR HAD EVER TOLD HIM HE WAS WORTH SOMETHING. THINK ABOUT THAT HE'S NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME. THAT ANYONE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE. TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS SOMEONE OF COLOR. AND I READ. I THINK EVERYBODY IN THAT ROOM MADE A COMMITMENT TO TRY TO IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND WE ALSO KNEW WE HAD TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND WE CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS -- THE OTHER THING THAT CAME OUT OF IT IS SIDE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HAD EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. THEY TOLD ME THAT -- MAY HAVE BEEN RAPED. AND THEN RAPED AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE OLDER SOME AS YOUNG AS SEVEN OR FIVE NAY MAKE AGAIN WITH A TWELVE AND SOMETIMES IS A MALE RAPING [inaudible] ANOTHER MALE. AND THEN THEY GET TO STAY CO SIBLING KILLED. DRUG CHARGES ALL OF THAT GOING ON APPARENT PRISON. AND EVERYONE IN HERE'S AN ADULT. AND EVEN AS AN ADULT YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T. MENTALLY. DEAL WITH THAT. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO -- I TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE'S PROBABLY EXPERIENCING UP POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. ASUS OR WHATEVER AND HE SAID NO BROTHER I'M EXPERIENCE POSTTRAUMATIC ST DISORDER. BECAUSE WHAT GOES ON IN THE STREET. AS MUCH FOR SOMETIMES IN WHAT GOES ON IN IRAN IRAQ AFGHANISTAN. AND IT'S ON ME EVERY DAY. AND SO -- THIS IS WHY -- AFTER LISTENING TO ALL THOSE. MEN WHO WERE PRESENT TELLING ME. HOW THEY WHAT THEY WERE LOOK WHAT THEIR CHILDHOOD WAS LIKE WE WERE ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY COLLEAGUES AND WE'RE JOINED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DIDN'T COME UNDER DOUG. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEN COOLEY -- IT BECAME VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET MONEY TO THEM AT EARLY A SO THEY COULD GET MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND SO WITH THE HELP OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. WE'RE EXIST ESTABLISHED A USED REINVESTMENT BOND WHICH PUTS THIRTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE STREET IN FACT THE GRANTS ARE GOING OUT THIS MONTH TO NONPROFITS IN PEOPLE DOING GOD'S WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. TO DEAL WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SO THAT WE CAN SAVE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- IN THE STREETS AT HOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT. GIVEN THAT HUG. THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING RIGHT NOW. AND SO. WHEN I ASKED THE SPEAKER ABOUT PUTTING DISKS THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER -- MY GOAL IS NOT ONLY TO TO IN THIS PROCESS. BUT TO FINALLY. COME TOGETHER MAYBE PUT A WHITE PAPER TOGETHER WITH THE HELP OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. NOT ONLY LOOK AT POLICY CHANGES WHICH WE DO ALL THE TIME. I THINK WE KNOW. WHAT'S GOING ON I NEED TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS. WE NEED TO IDENTIFIED IN INTO A POLICY STATEMENT THAT MAY BE ONE OR ALL OF US CAN CARRY. AND THEN WE CAN ALL UNITE BEHIND BUDGET REQUESTS. LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY. WE CAN ALL MAYBE YOU NIGHT NOW. BECAUSE YOU KNEW YOU WANTED AS IS MY MEMBERS HERE WILL TELL YOU YOU REALLY WANT TO GET INTO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER INSTEAD OF FIGHTING TO GET IT IN. LATER ON OR OR WORST OF ALL TRYING TO GO TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN TRYING TO GET IN LET'S LET'S SET THE BAR LÃ  SAID WHAT WE WANT NOW. AND HOPEFULLY THIS COMMITTEE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THOSE TYPES OF BILLS AND MOST IMPORTANT OUT I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH THAT WE WE PUT IN MORE MONEY TO HELP OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE STREET AND JUST DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. AND THEN ALSO PUT MEASURES OF SUCCESS WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE -- WHICH WE DON'T DO WELL. AND I THINK ALLOWS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT AUTHORED AND IT DIDN'T AND DINNER. AND HAVE ENOUGH SHUT UP SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HEAR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PROBABLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. COME UP AND GIVE US SOME TESTIMONY -- I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE AFRAID WHETHER IN EDUCATION WHAT YOU'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT YOUR PROBATION -- WHERE YOU SEE TO SEE OUR ANYONE IS DEALING WITH OUR? OUR JUVENILES I DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL AS IF WE'RE TRYING. TO CUT THE BUDGET OF FIRE PEOPLE. THIS IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE SYSTEM AND GET IN THE BEST QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- CAM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. WE MAY BE LOOKING AT A SEA CHANGE IN HOW WE DEAL WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE GOVERNOR'S ALREADY POINTED TOWARD THAT HE'S MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET. AND GUESS WHAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INPUT ON WHAT THAT THE FUTURE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE FOR THE NEXT WHAT FIFTY YEARS. AND SO -- YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND GOING FORWARD -- COULD BE. COULD BE VERY CRUCIAL BUT PROP FIFTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE WILL PUT FORTH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I'M AYE IT WILL THROW IN PROP SIXTY FORTY CANNABIS. MONEY ALL OF THAT. MEANS WE HAVE THE MONEY AND AND RESOURCES GET THIS DONE WE JUST NEED TO GET THIS DONE CORRECTLY AND START TALKING ABOUT OUR I RETURN ON INVESTMENT. BECAUSE EVERY KID THAT DOES NOT GO TO PRISON WE SAVE THE STATE AND TAXPAYERS EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. A YEAR AT THE VERY MINIMUM WE ONLY I WON'T GET INTO HOMES TAXES THEY PAY. ON BECAUSE I KNOW THE PROPERTY TAXES SALES TAXES -- STATE INCOME TAXES SO WE COULD WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A OF OF A BOOM. IN OUR A A GENERAL FUND REVENUE IF WE DO THIS CORRECTLY NET AND NOT ONLY JUST HAVING A SAFER STREETS. SO WITH THAT BEFORE I I'D BRING GONE -- OUR FIRST STEP PANELISTS I WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR ANYONE OF THE OTHER MEMBERS ARE HERE TO TO MAKE AND HE'S AND COMMENTS. YES MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER I WANT I WANT TO THANK YOU -- BUT BEFORE. I ENJOY THE LEGISLATURE KNOW YOU IN SOME OF OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE HERE THE WORKING ON ON THESE ISSUES FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND ONE MIGHT. ONE MIGHT THINK LIKE FILE. IT CERTAINLY. A SURPRISE AND IS THE FIRST TIME THIS COMMITTEE SET UP BY THEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR IT BECAUSE FOR DECADES WE'VE HAD A OVER A CAR SERRATION WE THAT LEGISLATIVE -- AND BALLOT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE -- LED TO CALIFORNIA BEING THE INCARCERATION CAPITAL THE WORLD SO YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING FIRST I THINK SOME THE LEGISLATION IN RECENT YEARS. HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT -- ON ON STOPPING THE MANDATORY MINIMUMS GETTING WHAT IS ON THESE MANDATORY ENHANCEMENTS WORKING ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUES BOTH IN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE SKINNER -- AS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULAR GET RELEASED SAID THE TIMING IS EXCELLENT NOW TO REALLY. DIVE DEEP ON THE EDUCATION SIDE BECAUSE AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE EXCELLENT SPEAKERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY AND I AYE. AYE BUT FOR THOSE THAT KNOW I DON'T KNOW I WORKED AS A DEADLY PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE. GETTING INTO ELECTED OFFICE AND WHEN I WAS PUBLIC DEFENDER BACK IN NINETY SEVEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. THAT WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND FRANKLY THERE WOULD IMAGINE SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN -- OF A SIGN AND A LOT OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO REALLY TURN THERE'S A MASSIVE SHIP OF INCARCERATION AROUND AND INSTEAD. TO FOCUS ON ON HEALING AB AND NOTHING YOU STATE IT CORRECTLY AND I'VE NO BASEBALL A LOT OF THE PLANS I HAVE. INCLUDING MANY THAT WERE FACING LIFE IN PRISON YOU TALK ABOUT THAT WE TALKED TO THEM TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR LIFE STORY -- IT'S A MIRACLE THAT THEY'RE STILL ALIVE -- THAT ALONE -- THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN AND SO I'M JUST GRATEFUL TO BE PART OF THIS TEAM OF BOTH TEAM UP HERE AS WELL AS OUT IT IN THE AUDIENCE AND MANY THAT AREN'T EVEN IN THIS ROOM. THEY'RE GOING TO HELP US CONTINUE. TO CHART THE RIGHT PATH AND IF I DO LEAVE I HAVE FOR COMMITTEE. FOR SENATE BILLS AT THE PRESENT THIS MORNING SO -- FOR THOSE OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE I SAT DOWN SENATE OUT -- BUT SOMEONE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT OUT OF DISRESPECT BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO ATTEND TO BUT EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING SPOKEN. BUT EVERYTHING'S BEEN RECORDED AND THIS WILL BE PART OF THE RECORD AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN IT AND THEY GET I WILL REITERATE WE HAVE MEMBERS HAVE TO GO IN AND OUT. AND HE JUST BE RELIEVED THAT SUMMARY DOING. YOU KNOW RACIAL BIAS LEGISLATION THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE SO WE WANT THEM TO GO TO THOSE COMMITTEE MEETINGS. AND AND GET IT TO THE SENATE SO -- AND EVERYONE ON HERE IS WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT'S VITAL TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE SO -- OF JUST KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING GOD'S WORK WHEN THEY LEAVE. ANYONE ELSE AT WE'RE JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY CARILLO. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WILL MAKE A STATEMENT. WIDE ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- TO MY RIGHT -- SHARED I WANT TO THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER SENIOR -- FOR ASKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR CONTINUING THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT pBEEN WORKING -- ON YOU KNOW HOW TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LAWS THAT FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE PENAL CODE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING. TO FIND A WAY TO ABOLISH AND CLOSE THE PRISONS -- AND MANY OF US CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SHINING A LIGHT ON THE BUSINESS OF INCARCERATION -- WHICH STARTS AT VERY VERY EARLY AGES RIGHT THERE IS REVENUE THAT'S GENERATED FROM. PROFILING THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED FROM INCARCERATING THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED FROM DISCIPLINING THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED FROM -- INCARCERATION AND THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED FROM FAULTY REHABILITATION. AND AND THAT ENTIRE CYCLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO INFUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY DO -- THE CULTURAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF EDUCATION. ESPECIALLY IN AND FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M VERY EXCITED. ABOUT THIS -- COMMITTEE IS BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL AFFORD US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE POWER THAT EDUCATION HAS IN BREAKING THE PIPELINE BEFORE I AM JOINED THE LEGISLATURE I WAS ALSO ON THE BOARD OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND I CAN RECALL HAVING A CONVERSATION BEFORE THE START OF THE SESSION WITH A NUMBER OF FACULTY MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THE FEARS. THAT PROFESSORS HAVE DEALING WITH STUDENTS. AND SIMPLE THINGS LIKE I'M. SAYING A STUDENT'S NAME. RECOGNIZING THEM. A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW THEIR PAST AND SO GIVING A COUPLE OF EXTRA SECONDS -- ENCOURAGING FOLKS. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE THE ETIQUETTE THAT -- EVERYONE SORT OF OWNS INTO WHEN THEY DECIDE TO BECOME A STUDENT AT A SCHOOL RIGHT HOW I TREAT YOU AS A PROFESSOR IS HOW I WANT YOU TO TREAT ME -- EXCEPT AROUND AND AND AND BECAUSE OF BIAS CITIES BECAUSE OF THOMAS. THAT THERE HAD BEEN A DISCONNECT AND IT WAS A IT WAS A SOBERING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION HAD BETWEEN FACULTY MEMBERS -- AND THE FACILITATOR ON HOW -- TO HE'LL OR REFOCUS THE KINDS OF ENERGY THAT THEY WERE SAYING IN THE CLASSROOMS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF COLOR AND ARE POOR. AND AND FACULTY MEMBERS WERE SAYING YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING CHALLENGES TEACHING -- BUT LOOKING AT THE HUMANITY THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE STUDENT -- WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO KIND OF KEEP IT REAL AND BRING IT CLOSE TO HOME. AND SO HAVING THOSE KINDS OF UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT WHO'S ON THE SELECTION IN THE HIRING COMMITTEES -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HIRING FACULTY AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE DIVERSE WELL IF IF CERTAIN FOLKS ARE ON THE COMMITTEE THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HIRE CERTAIN FOLKS -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE FOLKS LOOK LIKE THE FOLKS THAT THEIR TEACHING. THOSE ARE SMALL BUT VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK VITAL PARTS OF THIS OVERALL CONVERSATION AS WE LOOK AT DISMANTLING THIS PIPELINE AND SO I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM THE FOLKS WILL BE SPEAKING TODAY. AND I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW -- THAT EVEN THOUGH I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE TO ALSO PRESENT THAT I CAN I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER ME AN ALLY IN AN ADVOCATE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT'S IN THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE ALSO. WE COMPANION WITH OTHER COMMITTEES SELECT COMMITTEE ON BOYS MEDICAL WHICH I USED TO CHAIR IS STILL GOING NAY WILL STILL BRING UP ISSUES. THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE THEM. ACTUAL AND REAL WHICH THAT YOU CAN TOUCH AND I JUST WANTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- COMMA DOUG ALSO MENTIONS HER SELECT COMMITTEE WHICH I THINK IS A COMPANION PIECE TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH A QUICK DISTRICT GOOD MORNING. THREE THE CLERK WAS COOLEY SAID LADIES FIRST THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CALLING A GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WENDY CARILLO I REPRESENT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE WHICH INCLUDES THE NORTHEAST LA COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING -- DODGER STADIUM AND ALL OF AN INCORPORATED BASED LA. I WAS BORN IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY IN NINETEEN TOTALLY DATING MYSELF AND THAT'S OKAY. ANDI SAY THAT BECAUSE NINETEEN EIGHTY IS THE YEAR THAT CALIFORNIA BEGAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWENTY TWO PRESENTS FOR THE STATE. IT IS MY GENERATION. THAT HAS BEEN LITERALLY. IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. I WENT TO ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE HEIGHTS AT A TIME IN THE LATE NINETIES. WHEN THERE WERE -- AT THE TIME THREE DIFFERENT TRACKS AB AND C.. FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR A CLASS FOR A SCHOOL BUILT. FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED HALF OF MY CLASS STRIPPED OUT. I DROPPED OUT. AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A TEACHER AND A PRINCIPAL WHO CARED ENOUGH TO NOTICE THAT I WAS MISSING. TO BE ABLE TO BRING ME BACK INTO SCHOOL. AND SINCE THIRD GRADE. I HAD BEEN IN THE MAGNET COURSE. SO IN HIGH SCHOOL I GOT KICKED OUT OF THE MAGNET PROGRAM I GOT PUT INTO WHICH WAS ON THE TRACK. GOT PUT INTO THE HONOR CLASSES ON EIGHT TRACK WHICH WAS A TRADITIONAL TRACK AT THE TIME. GOT KICKED OUT OF HONORS GOT PUT INTO THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM. GOT KICKED OUT OF THAT AND FINALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THIRD GRADE I WAS IN A REGULAR CLASSROOM. AND AS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCES IN THE CLASSROOM SETTING. STILL DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE I WAS UP TO MY OWN SHENANIGANS AT THE TIME AS A TEENAGER. GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL AND GOT FOR ONE DAY AND ROLLED AND RAMONA HIGH SCHOOL IN EAST LA. WHICH WAS AT THE TIME. A SCHOOL FOR PREGNANT GIRLS. I WASN'T PREGNANT AND I WAS LIKE WHAT AM I DOING HERE. RIGHT -- GOT AND LEFT AT SCHOOL AND FINALLY. SOMEONE CALLED MY MOM. AND MY MOM HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD BEEN TRUANT. THAT I HAD BEEN MISSING. THAT I WASN'T GOING TO SCHOOL. AT THE TIME -- THE CITY ATTORNEY ALSO HAD I THINK IT WAS A CITY BY CITY CO OWNER I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT WAS A TIME IN WHICH PARENTS WERE BEING FINED IF YOUR KIDS WERE BEING TRUANT. AND SO PARENTS WERE ALSO GOING TO JAIL FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THE TRUNK FEES. THIS WAS ALL HAPPENING IN THE LATE NINETIES I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I GOT PUT BACK IN SCHOOL THE RULES OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL HAD AN ADULT SCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH IS WHY. I ALSO THINK ADULT EDUCATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND CATCH UP TO ALL MY CREDITS. AND FINALLY -- BE AT THE GRADE LEVEL WHERE I NEEDED TO BE IN WHAT WAS THEN THE SECOND SEMESTER OF SENIOR YEAR. AND I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME WITH MY CLASS AND ON STAGE BUT IT BARELY HAPPY. I SHARE THAT BECAUSE I THINK OUR PERSONAL STORIES AS LEGISLATORS. HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE THAT WE REPRESENT THAT WE ARE. ENTRUSTED TO REPRESENT. THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO THE WORK THAT'S NECESSARY. BECAUSE TWENTY TWO PRESENTS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AS THE GENERATION. IT'S MY IS MY GENERATION. AND SO THE FACT THAT WE SPEND MORE. IN THE INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PER YEAR AT THE TONE OF SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS MORE THAN THE ANNUAL TUITION AT HARVARD. AND ONLY SPEND INVEST FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SO IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. IS NOT THE VALUES OF A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE OR THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE I AM PROUD TO ALSO BE THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON YOUNG WOMEN YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN OF COLOR. WHICH WERE BRINGING BACK WHICH ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO HERE AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD. TO FINDING SOLUTIONS ON HOW WE% ENSURE THAT EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY TO THE CONVERSATION WHEN WE DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TO THIS HEARING AND HEARING WHAT THE EXPERTS HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MR COOLEY. WELL I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THIS HEARING UNFOLDING THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR CONVENE THIS GROUP. AND I GUESS THERE IS A PERSONAL STORY FROM MY SIDEBUT IT'S MORE JUST HOW I THINK ABOUT THINGS WHAT'S ON MY MIND AS I WALK. INTO THIS HEARING. AND AS I'M WALKING DOWN HERE TODAY I'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF AN ACCOUNT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. THE BOOK OF LUKE. THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER. WHERE JESUS TELLS A LITTLE STORY HE SAYS THERE WAS A RICH MAN? THIS ALL WE KNOW ABOUT THE GUY HE WAS RICH. DOESN'T SAY HE WAS PERSONABLE. THAN SAY HE WAS LOVED. DOESN'T SAY HE WAS A GOOD CHARACTER. AND ALSO EVOLVING SAY ABOUT SHOES YOU WERE RICH. YOU'RE PRETTY POOR INDEED. THAT'S ALL THEY CAN SAY ABOUT YOU. IF YOU'RE RICH. AND THIS RICH MAN STANDS OUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A A BAKER LAZARUS. WHO LAID HIS DOOR? AND IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO GET EVEN THE CRUMBS FROM THIS RICH MAN'S TABLE. AND SO YOU SORT OF SEE THIS PICTURE OF SOME. BUDDY SOME ENTITY THAT IS ABUNDANTLY PROSPEROUS. WITH NO HEART. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE BACK DOOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DEEP NEED. PEOPLE WHO ARE. HONESTLY PROBABLY LAZARUS MADE THE RICH MAN UNCOMFORTABLE. IN HIS ABUNDANCE. AND I SORT OF SEE AN AD A PICTURE. OF HOW AN ABUNDANT CALIFORNIA'S SOCIETY. CAN PREFERRED TO KEEP SOME PEOPLE IN THE BACKDROP. SO WE'RE NOT CALL TO MIND THE NEEDS AROUND AND ARE BOUND. IT IS IN PART OF THIS STORY JESUS SAYS -- EVENTUALLY LAZARUS DIES HE GOES TO HEAVEN THE RICH MAN ENDS UP IN HADES. SAYS CAN YOU GO COULD LATERALLY SCHOOL WORN MY BROTHERS. THEY WILL DO WHAT I DID. AND RESPONSE FROM JESUS IS TELLS A STORY WELL IF HE DIDN'T LISTEN. TO MOSES AND THE PROPHETS. THEY'RE NOT GONNA LISTEN. SO REALLY IN THIS STORY OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS WHICH I RELATE TO SEPARATE MATTER THIS HEARING -- JESUS SAYS THIS MEASURES. HOW YOU RELATE TO THE WHOLE LAWN THE PROFITS THE ENTIRE? LEGACY OF THAT FAITH. COMES DOWN TO THIS. SO I JUST FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. IT RAISES FOR US IN PUBLIC POLICY. THE THAT THIS WILL BECOME SORT OF THE MEASURE OF US. MEASURE OF OUR SOCIETY -- ONE COULD DARE SAY THAT ON SOME LEVEL WE WILL BE JUDGED BY HOW WE HOW WE APPROACH. BEEN ACTIVE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED US AND OUR INTERVENTIONS ABOVE ALL ELSE. SO I'M JUST VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS HEARING BUT SO THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I WOULD BRING IN THE ROOM TODAY REVEREND COOLEY FOR BLESSEDNESS. IN MAKING SURE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND SO -- LET ME BRING UP OUR FOR OUR FOR OUR FIRST SPEAKER AND AND AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE FOLLOW ALONG ON THE ON THE AGENDA WE WILL BEGIN WITH AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THE ROLE OF TEACHERS. AND ENDING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE I WANNA THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING HERE TODAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST SPEAKER. DR JOE MARSHALL. DOCTOR MARSHALL IS A MAC ARTHUR GENIUS AWARD. AND OPRAH'S USE YOUR BEST LIFE AWARDS. AS WELL AS A BEST SELLING AUTHOR LECTURER. AND AND OUR AWARD WINNING RADIO TALK SHOW -- OF STREET SOLDIERS ARE ON K. M. E. L.. WITH THAT I WILL ALLOW DOCTOR MARSH'S SPEAK ON THE ISSUE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ENDING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMAN JONES SAWYER -- I KNOW THESE THINGS GO FAST SO I AND I PUT TOGETHER THIS AMOUNT OF PLAY HAS IS. QUICK ONE PAGER THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT ON THE BACKSIDE IS WHO I AM BUT YOU JUST DID THAT SO THAT MAKES IT EASY -- BECAUSE LATIMES WATER WE HAVE INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN THE BIO AND ALL OF THAT THAT'S ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE DAILY NO IF YOU HAVE IT I THINK IT'S WITH A LOT OF PAPER. THANK YOU HAVE THEM WITH YOU. ARE. BIGGER YEAH OKAY AND THEN ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT I DO THAT DESCRIBES ALL PROGRAMS SERVICES SO I THOUGHT. IF YOU READ DEAD REAL QUICKLY WOULD JUST CUT THROUGH. AREAS YEAH IT THERE IT IS THAT WOULD CUT TO MAKE A LOT OF I DON'T THINK YEAH I DON'T THINK HE GOT PASSED OUT. SO YEAH I THINK YOU NEED TO PASS -- I HAVE IT OFF YES YOU HAVE -- WELL YEAH. THERE WE GO. SO THE BACK IS ME IT'S A PARAGRAPH. AND IN THE FRONT IS A PROGRAMMER SCRIPT IF YOU TAKE A MOMENT AND READ DOES THIS SORT OF JUST SECURE PAN TO WITH. AND AND MADE NOTES THEN I THINK IT THIS IS A MATTER OF TIME WOULD BE MORE. WILL BE BETTER SERVED. AND YOU CAN MAY JUST WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION RIGHT AWAY. OKAY PROTESTS ON INTEREST TIME MAYBE ONE JUST BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS YEAH BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER. WHAT ALIVE AND FREE WILL MAKE A BOYS CLUB DOES SO I'LL ALARM FREE IS A PROGRAM THAT I STARTED NOW THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO TO BASICALLY JUST DO THAT? KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE ALIVE. AND UNHARMED BY ABOUT THE FREE FROM A CAR SERRATION IT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY CALLED I'M FREE ACTUALLY WAS CALMING ABILITY WILL BE A BOYS CLUB. BUT SINCE I HAD GIRLS FROM THE BEGINNING. TAUGHT THAT AT SOME POINT -- IT WAS A BIT OF A MISNOMER SO WE HAVE SINCE THEN CHANGED THE THE NAME TO ALIVE AND FREE ALTHOUGH THE KIDS JUST CALL AT THE CLUB -- I WAS A TEACHER ADMINISTRATOR FOR YEARS. ACTUALLY STARTED PROGRAM BECAUSE I WAS A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND AND AND SAM'S IS GONE THEN BECAME AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AND FIGURED IF THE KIDS GOOD SURVIVING IN THE CLASSROOM EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY. BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE. DEMANDING INSTRUCTORS GAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK. YOU KNOW THE KIND OF TIAS HATED BACK MY NICKNAME WITH ME MISTER MARSHALL -- BUT THEY GOT GOOD GRADES ON ME AND WHEN I GRADUATED FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL I JUST FIGURED EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE GOOD. BUT SOMETHING SEEN THAT HAPPEN WHEN THEY GOT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND MY KIDS WOULD END UP EITHER PREGNANT OR IN JAIL FOR SELLING DRUGS OR THERE. AND I WILL GO TO FUNERALS AND I DID COULDN'T TAKE IT SO I DECIDED. TO REALIZE THAT BEING A GOOD TEACHER WASN'T ENOUGH SO I START IS ORGANIZATION IT WAS AN AFTER SCHOOL THING -- I TOLD THE YOUNG PEOPLE IF THEY COULD STICK WITH THE PROGRAM I WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM. I DECIDED NOT TO DO JOBS BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL THE ECONOMY. I JUST SAID THAT THE IF YOU STICK WITH THIS IF YOU'RE IN INTO VIOLENCE DRUGS TO GET OUT AND IF YOU'RE NOT AT THE END DON'T GET IN. THE SOMEONE WANT TO DO FOR YOU AND A LOOK MISS IT WOULD. AS A YOU PICKED A COLLEGE NOW FIND THE MONEY NOW ALSO PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. I WAS NOT A VENTURE CAPITALIST I DID NOT HAVE A I WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER -- BUT WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO DARE TO BE DIFFERENT WHICH IS A PHRASE WE USE. AND IN THOSE DAYS WE HAD T. SHIRTS IS THAT I DON'T DO DRUGS AND STUFF ABOUT THEM MORE WILLING TO COMMIT TO THAT. I FIGURED IT I WOULD COMMITTED THEM AND WE HAVE A BUNCH OF SAYINGS AND ONE IS IF YOU DO GOOD THINGS GOOD THINGS WILL COME TO YOU. AND THE THE REST OF THIS IS JUST WHEN A MIRACULOUS HISTORY THAT -- THE MONEY HAS COME THE KIDS HAVE GRADUATED MY FIRST COLLEGE GRADUATE WITH THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE A YOUNG LADY FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE. MY FIRST MALE COLLEGE GRADUATE WAS A NINETEEN NINETY FOUR A MORE FOR MORRIS BROWN COLLEGE HE WAS MY FIRST. JAIL HOUSE IS A SCHOOL HOUSE YOUNG MAN. OF A AND THIS YEAR I'M CELEBRATING COLLEGE GRADUATE NUMBER -- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT IT'S JUST BEEN REMARKABLE -- THE SO THERE'S SOME COMMON THINGS HERE. THERE'S ALL KIND OF THE STORES ALL CON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE. IN MY COLLEGE GRADUATION RATE IS ALMOST EVERY KID I SEND A COLLEGE GRADUATES -- I PERSONALLY RAISE THE MONEY AND HELP PAY FOR THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION -- I'VE HAD ALL KIND OF YOUNG PEOPLE I MET A YOUNG MAN IN. IN YOUTH AUTHORITY FOR THREE COUNTS OF ARMED ROBBERY AND ATTEMPTED MURDER ON A POLICE OFFICER HE GOT OUT. AND THE GRADUATE MORE HOUSE -- I HAVE YOUNG A YOUNG LADY LAST CAME LAST NIGHT WHEN SHE GOT THERE LAST NIGHT YOU SAID YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING I DON'T DO ANYTHING. BUT I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WAS A GOOD KID AND THIS WAS A PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR ME SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT -- SO WE GET. IT IS IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE THING. WHAT IS THE WORK WE HAVE A PRESCRIPTION A PRESCRIPTION IS? WHAT MAKES IT IS IS VERY DIFFERENT WE'RE NOT A REGULAR PROGRAM WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PRESCRIPTION YOU'VE HEARD THINGS ABOUT THE MESSAGE BEING BIGGER THAN A MESSENGER? FOR THIS PRESCRIPTION THAT WE USE IS TO PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM GETTING IN A MINDSET THAT ENDS UP MEANT ENDS ENDS THEM IN THE PRISON. OR IT ALSO PREVENTS THEM -- IF THEY'RE ALREADY THERE IT GETS THEM OUT OF IT SO. HELLO WHAT I DO IS TEACH OTHER PEOPLE PUT THE PRESCRIPTION I NEVER WANT TO FRANCHISE THE ORGANIZATION I WANT TO TEACH THE METHODOLOGY. HELLO WELL I WHAT I DO IS ACTUALLY TEACH OTHER PEOPLE HOW TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE ALIVE AND FREE -- I HAVE DISCIPLES OF MEDICAL STUDENTS EVERYONE PUT IT. AROUND CALIFORNIA LITERALLY AROUND. THE WORLD. I'M GOING TO A SOUTH AFRICAN IN A FEW MONTHS TO DO WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THERE BECAUSE THE ISSUES OF THE SAME REALLY WHEREVER YOU GO -- AND I'M JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS AS pJOB IS TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE FOR FREE. ANYTHING ASIDE. BECAUSE I WAS DOING THIS SO WELL. WE JUST ALL THESE IN BECAUSE THIS IS TAKING ME INTO PLACES I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GO. HE'S OUR OUR GOVERNOR NOW BUT IN TWO THOUSAND FORM THEN MERRIN NEWSLOOK POINTED ME TO THE POLICE COMMISSION FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN REFORMING THE POLICE WHICH IS HARD TO WORK WITH THE KIDS WITH A LOVE STORY. BUT WE'VE BEEN THE ONLY SEASONAL HAND IN HAND BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE POLICE STAFF TO DO MY YOUNG AND WHEN THEY DO DO WITH THEM. I WANTED TO DO WHEN AN EQUITABLE EQUITABLE MANNER -- SO. THAT'S THE THE CLIFF NOTES REAL QUICK -- YOU CAN ASK ANYTHING YOU LIKE A I DON'T WANT TO TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE PEOPLE I BELIEVE YOU DO WHAT NO OTHER POSSIBLE BUT IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND THAT'S WHAT BRAVE WHEN PRISON YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY WORKS. OKAY THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. I WOULD LOOK AT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING [inaudible] YEAH. A COUPLE OF HOURS IF YOU GUYS USED TO DO SO. TURN YOUR AYE AYE. MOST APPROPRIATE THING TO DO -- SO I SAID ON PUBLIC SAFETY WITH -- THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERY WEEK WE ARE REVIEWING LEGISLATIVE POLICY. I'M NOT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY EXPANDING THE PENAL CODE. AND WHAT I FIND IS THAT -- WE TEND TO WANT TO DEFINE FOLKS BY THEIR ACTIONS SO IF YOU DID. X. YOU SHOULD GET SEVEN YEARS TWELVE YEARS YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE PROHIBITIONS ASSESS TWO YEAR -- CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND TO HEAR YOU TALK AND THEN ALSO TO HEAR YOU SHARE THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TO REFORM THE POLICE COMMISSION I WAS RUNNING IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE BRIEFLY YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO KIND OF HELP. POLICY MAKERS AND OF THOSE. IN AUTHORITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY DEFINE FOLKS JUST BY YOU KNOW THE ONE OR A FEW BAD ACTIONS -- BECAUSE THAT CAN HAVE A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON THE JOURNEY THAT THEY ALTERNATELY HAVE TO TAKE -- I GUESS WITH THE WORD WE USE THIS PROFILING -- IT WORKED WITH THE POLICE HAS BEEN FASCINATING BECAUSE OF ONE TIME ONE TIME THE KIDS TOLD ME. OUT OF THIS AS A QUESTION AT THE KIDS SOMEBODY PLEASE ARE JUST LIKE A GANG OF CIVIL ONE WHETHER THERE'S A GAME TO SAY -- ON THEY WERE COLORS AND AND THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T TELL ON THE JONES. A SURVEY DOWN FOR THE HOME WE RIGHT A WRONG GUESS THE WAY THEY PUT IT. AND SO ACTUALLY A BIG HAND IN THE OTHER THING IS THAT IS THAT IS THE THING ABOUT THE POLICE LOOKING AT PROFILING THE COMMUNITY LOOKING THEM ALL THROUGH THE SAME LAND -- THAT. THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT NEVER EVEN ENTERS INTO MY ROOM AND WHEN A KID WALKS IN AND I SEE HIM I DON'T EVEN SEE THEIR KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOLDER I DON'T EVEN LOOK&lt;/c&gt; AT IT. AND LOOK AT ALL I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY. AS AN INSTRUCTOR LET ME TELL YOU THE TOUGHEST PLACE TO ME WAS GOING INTO THE TEACHER'S LOUNGE. BUT I WANT TO SEE TO LOUNGE OR THEM TO EAT LOTS OF THE TEACHERS I WOULD HEAR FROM THE THE TEACHERS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE KIDS JUST CAN'T DO IT. AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO IT. BASICALLY THERE WERE THREE THINGS. THE REASONS WHERE THEY LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. THEIR MOTHERS ON DRUGS -- IF I WAS IN JAIL HE GOT HIS START. AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU'RE A BAD TEACHER THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT WELL MY YOU SHE WAS THAT I HAD THE SAME KIDS. AND THEY WERE GET PAYS A BREEZE FOR ME. SO MY SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING. WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THERE'S NOW EVEN PUT IT THERE BASICALLY THE EXPECTATIONS I HAVE FOR THEM WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT THEY HAVE FOR THEM.

SO I'VE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TESTIFYING TODAY AND WORK WILL STAY IN CONTACT I WANNA HEAR MORE THOSE STORIES OF THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. SO I WILL LIKE TO BRING UP -- OUR FIRST PANEL. AN OVERVIEW IMPORTANCE OF EFFECTIVE EDUCATORS -- INVITE JEFF FREY THIS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. AND ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR. OF FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. DOCTOR MARK WITH A GRIN NOTE SHARE. SHAILA SHIRE. JUST [inaudible] THIS WEEK. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US TODAY. WHO WOULD LIKE? I I HAD YOUR NAME FIRST SO OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT WORKS AS WHEN THE CHECK AND AND THE FIRST ONE I THINK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- FOR HAVING THIS PANEL AND HAVING THIS DISCUSSION -- AND I WENT THINK THE THE FULL COMMITTEE -- ALSO -- FOR CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION. I APOLOGIZE -- I'M VERY PROUD AS A LEADER OF SAFETY TO HAVE A TASK FORCE THIS TASK FORCE REPORT. IS AVAILABLE OVER ON THE SIDE I THINK IT WAS HANDED OUT -- IF I THINK EVERYBODY HAS -- ONE AND IS BE ABLE TO SHARE OUR WORK THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS TO IN THE SCHOOL PRISON PIPELINE AND OUR COMMITMENT TO EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE FOR BLACK MALES. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OUR NATIONAL UNION A HAVE TO HAVE A TASK FORCE AND THEN PUBLISHED A REPORT I SAT ON THAT TASK FORCE WITH A FEW OTHER PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA SINCE IT WAS A NATIONAL -- EFFORT -- AND IT WAS RECLAIMING THE PROMISE OF RACIAL EQUITY IN EDUCATION. ECONOMIC IN CRIMINAL JUSTICES -- IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT ESTABLISHED A BROAD FRAMEWORK -- SOME OF THAT -- YOU'RE DISCUSSING A MINUTE MUCH OF THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING HERE ON THIS PANEL AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE ASSEMBLY -- AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL COMPASS AND IT IS -- EMONA HERE -- BETTER FACING THE INEQUALITIES FACING THE BLACK MALES OF ALL AGES -- WITH THAT UNDERSTAND AND IT WOULD BE UP TO STATE FEDERATIONS AND LOCAL UNIONS TO CONTINUE THAT EFFORT. AS A LEADER OF CFT NOT PRESIDENT AT THE TIME -- AND AS A LEADER OF SAFETY I DEMANDED TO CREATE A SPACE FOR THAT TASK FORCE TO HAPPEN CALIFORNIA IN C. F. T. -- I DIDN'T LEAD THE EFFORT BECAUSE I WANTED THEY'LL EFFORT LED BY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS -- I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE THE OUTCOME I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE -- THIS IS THE DISCUSSION OR THE PROCESS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS AN OPEN SPACE FOR OUR MEMBERS -- A DIVERSE GROUP OF MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THAT. OUT THEY DECIDED TO FOCUS JUST ON EDUCATION SO IN CALIFORNIA WE TOOK THE THE CRIMINAL ECONOMIC AND EDUCATION THE NATIONAL LEVEL WITH FOCUS JUST ON THE EDUCATION PART OF IT -- AND WE ALSO ONE OF THE FIRST DISCUSSIONS WHAT WE HAD WAS WHY ARE WE JUST FOCUSING ON BLACK MALES. I THINK THAT THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION ANY TIME WE JUST HAVE A REPORT AROUND JUST BLACK MALES -- OUR DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT ALL THE METRICS. BLACK MALES HAVE THE WORST METRICS OF ANY GRADUATION PRISON RATES OF ECONOMIC -- AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO FOCUS THE SECOND THING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND BE CLEAR ON IS THIS ARE THE SOLUTIONS ARE USUALLY INTERSECTIONAL -- IN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS -- AN EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF PASSED THE CURBS CORNER OF CROSS STREETS? THE SLOPE DOWN FOR PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS IT APPLIED TO PEOPLE AND CANES PEOPLE THAT MAYBE BLIND PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE. MULTIPLE A CHILD CARE -- A CARRIAGE -- THERE ARE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AT A SOLID BUT WAS FOCUSED ON ONE GROUP AND THAT'S WHERE I TALK ABOUT THE INTEREST ACT INTERSECTIONAL SOLUTIONS ON THAT COME OUT OF OUR REPORT THAT WE BELIEVE OUR PRIDE. ALMOND DON'T JUST FOCUS ON BLACK MALES WE FOCUSED ON BLACK MALES BUT THE SOLUTIONS SOLVE MANY THINGS -- SO WITH THAT I WANT TO GET TO TWO OF OUR FOUR OF PRIORITIES -- OUR PRIORITIES ARE FOCUSED IN FOUR AREAS DIVERSIFYING AND SPECIFICALLY A DIVERSIFYING WITH BLACK MALES -- ARE TEACHING AND CLASSIFIED FORCE -- EDUCATING ALL OF OUR TEACHING AND CLASSIFIED OF FOLKS IN. IN DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL SENSITIVITY -- I'LL GET TO THAT ALSO THAT NOT WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT C. T. -- CAREER TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIES -- AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THOSE OF THE FOUR BASIC POINTS -- I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FIRST -- TWO SO OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY THAT CAME OUT OF THIS REPORT WAS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO INTENTIONALLY. HELP IDENTIFY RECRUIT DEVELOP AND RETAIN BLACKMAIL EDUCATORS -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU WITH THE COMMITTEE -- BILLS LEGISLATION ANYTHING WE CAN PASS ON OR ANYTHING. WE CAN DO WITH OTHER GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND HELP IDENTIFY FUNDS A CREATE PROGRAMS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BLACK MALES BECOME EDUCATORS. IS A COMMITMENT THAT SEE IF TEAM MEMBERS AND LEADERS SEE IS A PRIORITY FOR ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT RECRUITING DEVELOPING RETAINING MORE BLACK MALE EDUCATORS AS A STARTING POINT FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES NOT ONLY FOR BLACK MALE STUDENTS. BUT AS RESEARCH APPROACH HAS PROVEN FOR ALL STUDENTS. ADDRESSING THE CURRENT DEARTH OF BLACKMAIL EDUCATORS MUST BE A CRITICAL ASPECT OF ANY PLAN TO DISMANTLE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND IT'S DEADLY. DEADLY DESPERATE IMPACTS ON SOME BLACK STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING AT THE BEGINNING AND IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT IS FINANCE ARE ECONOMIC. REASONINGS BUT I COULD TELL YOU. THAT FROM CFCS PERSPECTIVE THAT EVEN IF THE COST MORE. IN THE PRISON THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT -- I I THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO SELL THAT IT'S CHEAPER TO EDUCATE THEM THEIR CAR STRAIGHT. BUT IT'S HUMANE AND THAT TO US IS MORE IMPORTANT -- NOT TO DIMINISH THE RATIONALE THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE THAT NOT ON NECESSARY ON THE SAME PAGE -- ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE WE HAD OUR TASK FORCE BE REVIEWED BY -- MANY PEERS -- THAT HAVE DONE THIS AS WELL AS STUDENTS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE THERE WERE CERTAIN PEOPLE ON THE THE PANEL THE TASK FORCE THAT WANTED TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS. BLACK MALE STUDENTS COULD RESPOND TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD IS WHEN DID YOU FIRST HAVE A TEACHER WHO IS BLACK MALE. A BLACK MAN AND WHAT DID IT MEAN FOR YOU. SIX REYES SAID I WOULD LIKE MORE BLACK MALE TEACHERS THEY'VE BEEN IN OUR SHOES THEIR COMPREHENSION LEVEL OF US IS HIGHER. ANOTHER ONE SAID THIS YEAR I'M A SOPHOMORE HE CALLED US KINGS AND WE BELIEVE THAT. THERE ARE MANY. EXAMPLES OF THAT IN THE REPORT -- IT WAS. HEART WRENCHING I SHOULD SAY -- SADLY ONLY 1% OF TEACHING CALIFORNIA BLACK MALES RESEARCH CONDUCTED FOR OUR UNIONS RACIAL JUSTICE PLAN FOUND AT WHITE MALE STUDENTS. TO WHITE MALE TEACHER WAS ABOUT. FIFTEEN TO ONE FOR BLACK MALE STUDENTS IT WAS. FIFTY FOUR TO ONE AND CONTINUE WITH THE INTERSECTION ALLERGY LATINO MALES IT WAS SEVENTY SEVEN TO ONE I'M SO WE KNOW THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE -- BUT AGAIN WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE ONE ISSUE RIGHT NOW THE GROSS DISPARITY SCREAMS FOR URGENT ATTENTION. THE SECOND OUR FOCUS WAS TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY RACIAL EQUITY AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS ALL THREE ISSUES. IT KEEPS CHANGING AND AND FLOWING -- BIAS TRAINING THAT HELPS TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL STAFF UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN PERSONAL BIAS. TEACHERS SUCH AS ME THAT LOOK LIKE ME WE NEED CONTINUING TRAIN I AM LEARNING ALL THE TIME I WENT RECENTLY TO DALIO THAT'S THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS CONFERENCES LAST WEEKEND. AND THE TRAINING THAT I SAW SPECIFICALLY ON THE TALK SOON. TOXICITY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES IF THEY DON'T HAVE ONE PERSON CARING FOR THEM -- DOESN'T TURN IT CANNOT TURN AROUND THE MENTAL HEALTH. DAMAGE THAT OCCURS -- WHEN YOU HAVE DEVASTATING SITUATIONS AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD -- AND IT'S THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND SOLUTION THAT DOES HELP THAT THAT RAISES THE AWARENESS OF NOT ONLY SOMEONE THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU BUT SOMEONE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU TO HELP OUT -- AND THAT'S THAT IS THE SECOND THING THAT WERE FOCUSING ON ANOTHER QUOTE IN QUESTION TO THE STUDENTS WHAT SHOULD TEACHERS BE LEARNING TO EFFECTIVELY TEACH BLACK STUDENTS. ONE WORK ONE STUDENT RESPONDED I HAVE A GOOD GPA I COME TO SCHOOL AND WE SOME DAYS AND THEY DON'T ASK WHY. ANOTHER SAID YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH KIDS QUOTE KIDS BEFORE YOU CAN CONTROL THEIR LIFE WE DON'T WANT TO BE CONTROLLED IN THE FIRST PLACE. MANAGERS. SORRY -- THAT WAS NOT IN THE QUOTE LET ALONE BEING CONTROLLED BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW YOU -- AS EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFY PROFESSIONALS WE ARE ALL COMMITTED TO ANSWERING ARE CALLING TO HELP OUR STUDENTS TO GROW TO SUCCEED AND TO LEAD. THAT'S WHY I BECAME A TEACHER IN THE FIRST PLACE -- WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WITHOUT TEARING DOWN THE OP SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN BACKED INTO THE U. S. EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK MALE STUDENTS. SINCE OUR NATION'S FOUNDING. RACIAL EQUITY FOCUSED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED TO HELP ALL EDUCATORS RISE TO THAT CHALLENGE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS LATER IN YOUR PRESENTATION -- OF MANY PEOPLE -- I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU -- PERSONALLY AND OF THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE AND WANT TO TELL YOU THAT SEE IF HE'S COMMITTED ON WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO BEING INCREASE. SPECIFICALLY THESE TWO AREAS ARE JUST AND THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. S.. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MARQUITA GORNO SHIRE I'M THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATOR PREPARATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. IN MY ROLE I HAVE PRIVILEGE OF DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAMS ALONG SIDE MY DEAN AND FACULTY CAL COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THROUGHOUT THE CSU EDUCATOR PREPARATIONS PROGRAMS FOCUS ON EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT OUR GRADUATES ARE PREPARED ON DAY. ONE AS BEGINNING TEACHERS TO WORK WITH ALL DIVERSE LEARNERS IN CALIFORNIA THE CSU PREPARES MORE THAN -- HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TEACHERS PRESCHOOL THROUGH TWELFTH AT APPROXIMATELY GRADUATE FROM THE CSU. OUR FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO PREPARE EDUCATORS WHO DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT DELIVER HIGH QUALITY. CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHING THAT ENSURES THAT ALL PK TWELVE STUDENTS ARE ACADEMICALLY PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. BUT CRITICAL PILL PILLAR OF THE CSU SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES GRADUATION EDITION OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONALLY OUR PROGRAMS REPAIR TEACHERS COUNSELORS AND LEADERS WHO CAN WORK TOGETHER ALONGSIDE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. TO DISRUPT SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES IN EDUCATION AND PROVE THAT THE PROLIFERATION OF THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION THE PROBLEM THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IS THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF COLOR. INCLUDING THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBT Q. THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND OR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ARE PLACED INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. RESULTING FROM MINOR SCHOOL INFRACTIONS AND DISCIPLINARY MATTERS OFTENTIMES EDUCATORS SUBJECT THE STUDENTS TO HARSHER PUNISHMENTS THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS FOR THE SAME BEHAVIORS. A RECENT ANY A RESOLUTION STATED SCHOOLS MUST BE SAFE AND WELCOMING PLACES FOR ALL STUDENTS DISCRIMINATORY TOWARD NON AND FOCUS ON EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES THAT REACH THE WHOLE CHILD. FURTHER DISCIPLINARY PRINT POLICIES MUST EMPHASIZE PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION OVER PUNISHMENT. WELL MY COMMENTS TODAY FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON TEACHER PREPARATION IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PROJECT REBOUND IS A SYSTEM WIDE SPECIAL ADMISSION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION. AND ACCLAMATION OF FORMALLY INCARCERATED YOUTH INTO COLLEGE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE AREAS OF BEST PRACTICES TO ADDRESS THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. RECRUITMENT MULTIPLE PATHWAYS INTO TEACHING AND CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION. RECRUITMENT OF STRONG AND DIVERSE CULTURALLY COMPETENT TEACHERS COUNSELORS AND LEADERS WHO REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WILL SERVE. AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE CSU AND HELPS TO MITIGATE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES AND THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE SUPPORT THE INFO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A DIVERSE TEACHING FORCE. CLOSING MIKE AND SOCIAL BENEFITS TEACHERS OF COLOR SERVICE STRONG ROLE MODELS BECAUSE OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THEY OFTEN HAVE HIGHER EXPECTATIONS THAN THEIR PEERS FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. THE OFTEN DEVELOP MORE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS AND THEY'RE OFTEN BETTER ABLE TO MITIGATE TENSIONS ARISING FROM RACIS. TEACHER DIVERSITY WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS A WHITE STUDENTS WHO OFTEN MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN FROM THE CULTURALLY DIVERSE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES THAT NON WHITE TEACHERS BRING TO THE CLASSROOM. THE CHRONIC TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT EXIST IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF STUDENTS OF COLOR AND POOR STUDENTS. DATA FROM THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS INDICATE THAT DISTRICTS THAT SERVE MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR EMPLOYED ABOUT FOR MORE TIME FOUR TIMES MORE TEACHERS THAT ARE NOT FULLY CERTIFIED. SIMILARLY STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE TAUGHT BY UNDERPREPARED. THAT'S IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE TEACHER SHORTAGE IN MULTIPLE WAYS. THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM THERE ESTABLISH PIPELINE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION ACROSS THE SECONDS INTO OUR TEACHER CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS. WE HAVE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS TO BEGIN AS EARLY AS MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL AND STRATEGIES FOCUS ON FRESHMAN TRANSFER STUDENTS AND POST BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS AND CAREER CHANGERS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AT ALLOCATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS FOR FOUR YEAR INTEGRATED TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHICH IS A PATHWAY FOR FRESHMEN WHO KNOW AT THE VERY BEGINNING THAT THEY WANT TO BE A TEACHER. THIS SUPPORT RESULTED IN TWENTY SIX NEW PROGRAMS IN THE CSU. IN REGARDS TO CREEK CONSTRUCTION WE PREPARE TEACHERS COUNSELORS LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND AND DEMONSTRATE BEST PRACTICES IN TEACHER EDUCATION. OUR PROGRAMS ARE BASED UPON THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS AND TEACHING PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WHICH REQUIRE BEGINNING TEACHERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO PROVIDE SAFE. HEALTHY AND SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH AND EVERY LEARNER. PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING DEEP CONTENT KNOWLEDGE IN CANDIDATES RELATED TO LITERACY MATHEMATICS AND OTHER CORE SUBJECT AREAS SO THAT OUR CANDIDATES ARE PREPARED ON DAY ONE TO TEACH A CALIFORNIA COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS AND THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS. SECOND OUR PROGRAMS EMPHASIZE THE WELL BEING OF THE WHOLE STUDENT. WHOSE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES ADDRESSED THROUGH INSTRUCTION ON CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PEDAGOGY. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION THAT SUPPORT SUCH PRACTICES CAN HELP TO MILLER EIGHT DISPARITIES AND HOW STUDENTS ARE DISCIPLINE. THIRD OUR FACULTY WORK WAS SO SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS TO DESIGN AND DELIVER MEANINGFUL CLINICAL EXPERIENCES INCLUDING RESIDENCIES. THE CSU NEW GENERATION OF EDUCATION AS EDUCATORS INITIATIVE IN GI. HAS RESULTED IN POWERFUL ANTI PARTNERSHIPS THAT BEGIN WITH A SHARED VISION OF EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION. COLLABORATION ON DEFINING PRIORITIZE SKILLS FOR A CANDIDATES PROVISION OF HIGH QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE THESE SKILLS SUPPORTED BY EXPERIENCED TEACHER MENTORS. AND USE OF DATA TO DRIVE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. FINALLY OUR PROGRAMS REPAIR CANDIDATES TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER EDUCATORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITHIN A WHOLE SCHOOL REFORM MODEL THE CALIFORNIA MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. THIS COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK ALIGNS ACADEMIC BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND A FULLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL STUDENTS. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS. WHICH IS RESULTED IN EDUCATORS BOTH AT THE PRE SERVICE AS WELL AS IN SERVICE LEVELS AS MY COLLEAGUE STRESS TO ASSESS SCHOOL DISCIPLINE PRACTICES TO ENSURE SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL STUDENTS. WE KNOW THE MORE TIME STUDENTS SPEND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM THE MORE THEY LOSE THEIR SENSE OF CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL. THIS RESULTS IN INCREASED RATES OF TRUANCY CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WHICH IN TURN EXACERBATES EQUITY GAP AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENTS LEAVING SCHOOL. IN THE CSU WE'RE COMMITTED TO CHANGING THIS TRAJECTORY TO THE PRACTICES ABOUT. HOW I HAVE OUTLINED TODAY? SO THAT EACH AND EVERY STUDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE AND BECOME A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF HER COMMUNITY. ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US TO PREPARE EDUCATORS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS CRITICAL TOPIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP UNTIL WHAT IT SO PART OF MY PARTY WHERE WILL LIKE THIS THE COMMITTEE TO GET TO AN IN AND OUT TO IT THIS WAY -- WHAT WHEN MY SON WAS -- SEVEN IN FIRST GRADE -- BUT IT. THE PRINCIPAL HIS TEACHER AND HIS MOTHER WAS A TEACHER HAD DECIDED. DADDY HE WAS WILLFULLY DEFINE. AND THEY BROUGHT ME IN TO TALK TO ME ABOUT NEXT STEPS -- THE FIRST THING THEY TALKED TO ME ABOUT THE IF HE ACTED A CERTAIN WAY WOULD BE SUSPENDED. A WHICH I PUSH BACK AND SAID THE REASON YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE MY SON IS THE DESCENDANT OF KINGS AND QUEENS FROM AFRICA AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH A STRONG BLACK MAN -- THEY LIKE THAT ANSWER IT DIDN'T. TRY TO TELL ME MY SON WAS EIGHTY DE. UM IF YOU KNOW ME FROM THIS MORNING HE'S NOT AT T. JUST REALLY HYPER LIKE IS THAT -- AND SO -- I KIND OF PUSHED BACK EVEN HARDER ON THAT. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT EXPELLING HIM. AND THEN I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT THEY WANT TO PUT HIM ON REDLANDS. WHAT KIND OF SNACKS? AND I SAID SOME NON PROFESSIONAL WORDS. WHERE THEY HAD TO CALL THE RESOURCE OFFICERS AND SCHOOL POLICE TO ESCORT ME OUT OF THAT ROOM -- WE WORKED IT OUT AND WE WE GOT TO A PLACE TO WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT. THE NEXT YEAR MY SON HAD IT AFTER AMERICAN MALE TEACHER WITH DREADLOCKS. AND HE BECAME A STRAIGHT A STUDENT. ON A BENCH THE GRADUATED FROM MOREHOUSE WITH A DEGREE IN BIOLOGY AND MATH AND HE'S NEVER LOOK BACK AND HE'S NOW A TEACHER IN LA UNIFIED WHICH I'LL. TALK ABOUT THAT. FIASCO -- TO BUT THERE'S YES MY QUESTION IS IN HOPEFULLY GET US -- TO THE RESOURCES. AND THE TEACHERS ARE GIVING. AS TOOLS TO DEAL WITH -- SO QUOTE WE GOT RESIDENTS ARE WITH YOU TO FIND AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY WE'LL GET RID OF THE TERM AT RISK AND CALL THEM AT PROMISE BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE RISK DECIDED OR PROMISES OF FUTURE -- YOU'RE ONLY GIVEN SO MANY TOOLS AND SOME OF IT ENDS UP WITH REDLANDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW WHEN YOU TRAINING THESE YOUNG TEACHERS WHAT TOOLS YOU KNOW DO YOU ARE WE NOW TO RUN DE ESCALATION AND WE DON'T WHAT A WEEK. AND IF AND IF WE DO NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE WE GET. TOOLS TO DIFFERENT. WHETHER TEACHER ON THE JOB OR WERE YOU TRAINING NOW -- WHAT KIND OF BUDGET ASK WOULD THAT BE WHAT IS THAT IS THAT A? IS THAT DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE EDUCATION CODE IS THAT SO I MEAN WHAT WOULD YOU THINK I KNOW THIS IS LIKE COMING OUT OF NOWHERE BUT THINK IF I HAD. I COULD GIVE YOU A BLANK CHECK AND YOU COULD JUST DECIDE WHICH ONE TO TO TAKE ARM THE TEACHERS SO THEY CAN DO THIS JOB A LOT BETTER. MATT MASS ART THERE. I MENTION THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT THAT'S A FANCY NAME FOR A NEW SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA FOR HOW WE ARE STRUCTURING -- SCHOOLS AND IT'S BRINGING ALL MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY TEACHERS COUNSELORS LEADERS FAMILIES TOGETHER. TO DEVELOP INSTRUCTION THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT A PYRAMID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID IS JUST GOOD TEACHING FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND HAND AS YOU MOVE UP IN THE PERIOD THE IN THE PYRAMID YOU NEED MORE SUPPORTS YOU MAY NEED SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS YOU MAY NEED -- AND A LITERACY COACH TO COME IN YOU MAY NEED A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TO COME IN YOU MAY NEED A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST TO COME IN. AND DO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM IF YOU WERE TO GIVE ME A BLANK CHECK. I WOULD EXPAND THAT SYSTEM INTO PRE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES AND IN SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT ALL OF OUR FACULTY HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE AREAS OF EMPHASIS IN THE C. ISSUES ON COOPERATION BECAUSE A SINGLE TEACHER CANNOT DO IT BY HERSELF AND WE KNOW THAT. SO HOW DO WE BUILD IN SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN ALONGSIDE FAMILY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO GET WHAT EACH AND EVERY LEARNER NEEDS THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT BLANK CHECK -- OR GIVE THEM THE FAX TO ASK FOR TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE. THAT'S A STARTING POINT -- AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT IT. WHAT I HEAR WHEN SHE SAYS THAT IS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING MULTIPLE RESOURCES? AND IT CAN JUST BE FOR THE STUDENTS IT ALSO SB FOR THE FAMILIES -- BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEIR OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL TIME THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT JUST THE TEACHER IT HAS TO BE. ALL OF THESE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES COUNSELING RESOURCES -- EVEN SITE YOU KNOW. DOCTOR PHYSICAL RESOURCES -- IN THAT THAT IS KIND OF CHANGING THE STRUCTURE AND AND LOOK OF OUR SCHOOLS INTO COMMUNITY SCHOOLS -- SO THEY'RE ALL TYPES OF RESOURCES THERE -- THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT -- WHICH IS. PROBABLY. MORE FINER EASIER TO DO OR THE ART AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE TRAINING OF THE STAFF THE CHEN IN THE EDUCATION WHEN I WAS A TEACHER AS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER. BUT I PUSHED TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES I HAD NO BACKGROUND TO DO THIS I KNEW I WANTED TO DO THIS NOR WERE THERE ANY RESOURCES PROVIDED TO ME BY THIS SMALL SCHOOL CARPINTERIA -- TO DO IT IS AND I WAS TOLD THE LAST DAY OF BEFORE THE SPRING SEMESTER. AS THE HEAD BASKETBALL COACH IN THE BILL MIDDLE OF BASKETBALL SEASON -- TOLD HAD NEW CURRICULUM TO TEACH THAT I DID ASK FOR BUT WASN'T PREPARED TO DO ARM AND I TRIED MY BEST TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO THE STUDENTS -- BUT THAT TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO THE TEACHERS AND THE IMPACT IS WELL THAT'S ONE PLACE TO START TO HELP OUT WITH THIS -- BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE AND THE MONEY THE BIG MONEY QUESTION OR ISSUE OR THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WITH ALL THESE RESOURCES AND NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE STUDENT. SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO AVOID -- THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OUR SCHOOLS AND TO FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING. DO WE ALSO NEED TO DO A POLICY. MAYBE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY SAY YES I BELIEVE IN THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS MAY SAY. I DON'T NEED IT IS THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE MAKE POLICY PRE ENTIRE STATE. WE BUDGET FOR THE ENTIRE STATE AND AND THIS BIG STATE NOT EVERYBODY BUYS IN. RIGHT TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT IT I THINK EVERY DISTRICT NEEDS TO BUY IT. SO IS THAT ALSO POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. BECAUSE THE POLICY CONSIDERATION AYE AYE -- DEFER TO MY SCHOOL DISTRICT COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF WHAT WORKS BEST WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND HOW ARE THEY DEFINING THIS IDEA OF A COMMUNITY SCHOOL. MASS FOR ONE MORE THING SINCE YOU. YOUR BOOK. IF AND IT WAS MENTIONED. EARLIER -- BY THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS AND IT'S ABOUT RECRUITING MORE TEACHERS OF COLOR TO WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO -- I KNOW WE HAVE A FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED THIS YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. WE NEED MORE OF THAT WE NEED SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP -- FOR OUR CANDIDATES WE NEED FINANCE SCHOLARSHIP SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK IN TODAY'S NEWSPAPER THE CSU OF JUST MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT A SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP WHEN THE BECHTEL FOUNDATION TO AWARD SCHOLARSHIPS. TO STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO WORK AT HIGH NEED SCHOOLS AND SO WE HAVE THREE POINT TWO MILLION THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE CSU TO SUPPORT THREE HUNDRED CANDIDATES. WE'RE GOING TO WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HIGH NEED SCHOOLS A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM SO WE THINK ABOUT SUPPORT AT THE BEGINNING WAS TO THINK ABOUT SUPPORT DURING A STUDENT DURING A CANDIDATES PROGRAM. AND THEN THE FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAMS -- AGAIN FOCUS TARGETED ON TEACHERS WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK IN HIGH NEED AREAS. MATH SCIENCE SPECIAL EDUCATION BILINGUAL EDUCATION. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A QUESTION COULD I I I MAY ADD IN THERE. HOUSING SUBSIDY MIGHT GET A WHOLE LOT OF TEACHERS IT ABSOLUTELY WAS. THAT WAS IN MY NOTES I WAS IN MY BACK POCKET. I DO AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT. STRUCTURAL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CREATING A SYSTEM WE'RE YOUR TRAINING TEACHERS TEACHING TEACHERS ABOUT THE BIGGER ASPECTS OF WHAT IT IS BUT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS WE KEEP. THROWING MORE AND MORE OBLIGATION ON OUR TEACHERS WHO WANT TO GO AND TEACH. WHERE THE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES WHERE THE HEALTH SERVICES AGENCIES? FROM THIS NOTION OF A COMMUNITY SCHOOL. BECAUSE IF IF THE IF THE SCHOOLS ARE NOW IT IS A GREAT NOTION. BUT WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE. SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO TEACHERS THAT WERE NOT TURNING THEM INTO SOCIAL WORKERS THAT WERE NOT TURNING THEM INTO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INTO. THOSE COMPONENTS HAVE TO COME IN AS WELL. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES WERE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF BECAUSE WHEN THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE HERE IS WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE BACK AT WERE JUST WE WERE TRYING TO REFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHICH IS THE SYSTEM WE SHOULD EVEN HAVE. WHICH I TO REFORM THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WHICH IS A SYSTEM WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE. ALL OF THIS GOES POINTS BACK. TO SUPPORTS FOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS KIDS COME INTO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THEY THEY ARE PREPARED TO LEARN AND TO DO THAT WORK AS A STUDENT. AND YET WE HAVE A WHOLE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS THEM IN SUPPORT THE TEACHERS IN SUPPORT LET'S TEACHERS KIND OF DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO FOR BRING ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS TO BEAR. SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN THE FAMILY. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SPOKE. WITH ALL THE PRO FOR THE CHILD WITHOUT DEALING WITH THAT FAMILY AND THAT COMMUNITY AND AND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. SO HOW DO WE RE THINK THIS SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS THERE AND WHEN WE DON'T JUST KEEP PUTTING THIS ON ON THE TEACHERS. WELL -- AS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER. I BECAME A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER NOT. I TOOK MATH BECAUSE IT WAS EASY FOR ME NOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO TEACH IT I WANTED TO HELP STUDENTS. SO THE CONCEPT THE TEACHERS WANT TO TEACH ISN'T IS IS TOO NARROW TEACHERS WANT TO HELP. AND I DON'T OBEY I DID WANT AYE AYE OTHERS AT DISCOUNT YEAH OKAY BUT I WORRY ABOUT THROWING TOO MUCH ON THE TO PUBLICATION. I TEACHERS WHO WANT TO HELP BUT BUT THEY ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A CLASSROOM TOO MANY KIDS IN A CLASSROOM REYES AWAY. BUT THEY HAVE THAT BROADER RESPONSIBILITY THEY NEED TO HELP. THEY CAN'T BE THERE ONE OF THE THAT A NEXUS HOW ALL THIS WORKS TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE KIDS FOR SO MANY TIMES. IF WE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE PARENTS CAN ABDICATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES WERE OTHER PARTS THE SYSTEM ARE OPERATING IN SILOS AND NOT SUPPORTING THIS FUNCTION. MORE AND MORE THAN FALLS ONTO THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TEACHER FOR HOME WE HAVE NECESSARILY HAVE THE TOOLS FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE A FORTY TO GO SOLVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS IN AND I AGREE THERE WILL THERE IS A LOT -- HANDED DOWN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS IS THE OVER ACADEMIA FOCUS. AND THE SCHOOLS -- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LEFT THE CLASSROOM WAS BECAUSE I HAD LAST TIME TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS AND HAD TO FOCUS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL ISSUES AND HAD TO FOCUS BECAUSE AS A MATH TEACHER. AND I WAS THERE WHEN THE HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM WAS PASSED -- AND THERE WAS SO MUCH EMPHASIS THE OTHER THING IS NOT TO FORGET THE CLASSIFIED AS WELL BECAUSE THE CLASSIFIED HAVE A AS HAVING ACTUAL VESTED ADULTS ON CAMPUS WHETHER THEY'RE THE JANITORS TO THE SECRETARIES. HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS DAY TODAY I KNOW SO MANY CLASSIFIED THAT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY COUNSELING THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT LOOK MORE LIKE THE STUDENTS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION SAID THERE THAT'S WHERE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL COMES IN -- AS WELL AS ADDING THOSE RESOURCES TO TAKE AWAY THE ACTUAL -- LEGITIMATE COUNSELING FROM THE TEACHER WITH. TEACHERS WANT TO COUNSEL STUDENTS BUT NOT IN A CLINICAL WAY WEEDING CLINICAL COUNSELORS THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEMAND AN AD -- SO I THINK WE AGREE ON MOST OF THE THINGS I WAS JUST TRYING -- TO CLUB MED BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND I THINK IT'S EXCITING IT'S ARE INTERESTING. BUT SORT OF BACK TO THE CHAIRS COMMENT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE WORKING ON SO THAT WE ARE BUILDING. TAKING ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP KIDS OUT OF THE SILOS. AND INTO A COORDINATED WAY YOU'RE SORT OF LAY THAT GROUNDWORK BUT YOU JUST ONE PIECE OF THIS. YOU CAN'T DO THAT A LOT RIGHT AND THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT FRAMEWORK AND ON YOU HAVE A COPY OF MY REMARKS. AND THERE'S SOME RESOURCES AT THE END THIS IS A SYSTEMIC WAY TO LOOK AT SUPPORTING ALL STUDENTS AND ALL TEACHERS BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD NOT PUT THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. ON A SINGLE TEACHER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH AND EVERY LEARNER IN HER CLASSROOM WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF FAMILIES AND OTHER EDUCATORS WHO ARE IN THAT. SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IT'S IN OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IT'S WORKING -- ACROSS ABOUT FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA SO -- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AT ANOTHER TIME YES DEFINITELY AND AND MAYBE WE CAN. WHEN WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE? THE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION YES TONY THURMOND WHO WE WE HAVE A LITTLE. KNOWLEDGE OF MOVIE CAN INCORPORATE HIM IN SOME KIND OF POLICY SLASH BUDGET REQUEST BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WERE. WHICH IS WHAT MR STONE IS GETTING TO LET'S CREATE THIS LET'S MAKE IT BUT MAKE SURE IT WORKS. AND WE WE DON'T TRADE SOMETHING THAT FALLS ON ITS HEAD BECAUSE WE WE PUT TOO MUCH AT THE TOP SO. THANK YOU I THANK YOU BOTH THIS WAS SIX YEARS WAS IN LIGHTING THANK YOU. NOW LIKE TO CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL I DID A FINE OBSTACLES. IN TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE MELANIE RICHARDSON AND ANGELA WILLIAMS. GOOD MORNING HI GOOD MORNING MORNING. ELECTIONS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MY TIME IN A START IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU JUST MENTIONED WITH RECRUITMENT -- AYE MY NAME IS MELANIE RICHARDSON AND I'M HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER FOR LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST -- COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE AND WE SERVE ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND SO MY JOB IS TO OVERSEE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING FOR ALL OF OUR COLLEGES IN OUR CENTERS. AND SO I AM THE HOW TO PERSON ON RECRUITING -- FACULTY AND STAFF I ALSO SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF OUR BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF ASSOCIATION AT OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH THREE A DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION OF STAFF AND FACULTY OF COLOR. I WORK WITH ALL OF OUR AFFINITY GROUPS SO A P. I. A LATIN X. WE HAVE A RAINBOW AFFINITY GROUP THAT WE JUST STARTED. SO THOSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK THAT I WORK WITH AND SO I WANTED TO DISCUSS THE HOW TO THE A MODEL. OF HOW AND WHERE TO RECRUIT. AND WHAT'S WORKING WHAT NEEDS TO STOP HAPPENING AND THEN HOW WE ARE THEN DEVELOPING AND RETAINING. THE THESE FACULTY AND STAFF. SO SO THE TIMING IS RIGHT AND I HAVE FIVE WHOLE MINUTES. SO. SO I AM I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT THE FIRST THING THAT I FOUND I'VE BEEN WITH US RULES TWELVE YEARS WORKING AS CAPACITY SIX AND A HALF YEARS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW WE TALK ABOUT FINDING DIVERSE. CANDIDATES WE TALK ABOUT BLACK MALE FACULTY A LOT OF COMMUNITIES JUST UNAWARE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE DON'T THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. SO -- MY APPROACH HAS BEEN TO GET WHERE PEOPLE ARE. AND THEY MORE SPECIFICALLY GET WERE COMMUNITIES ARE AND THEN USE OTHER. PEOPLE AND THEIR AFFINITY GROUPS TO SPREAD THE WORD FOR EXAMPLE I'M A MEMBER OF A LOT OF AFFINITY GROUPS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN -- BLACK WHEN ORGANIZED POLITICAL ACTION ZACHMAN SISTER CIRCLE ALL OF THESE GROUPS AT LARGE IN NUMBER SO WHEN I SHARE AN OPPORTUNITY. IT'S BROAD AND THEN I ASK THE SAME OF MY NATIVE DEAN AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AND SHE SHARES WITH HER COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE NO ACCESS. TO SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS I DO AS WELL TO HELP WITH -- AWARENESS RECRUITMENT OF SPECIFIC GROUPS AND THEN GENERALLY THERE FOR CAREER INTACT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WORK AND DON'T WORK BUT WE WEREN'T WE WEREN'T DOING THAT WE WEREN'T SCHERING ENOUGH -- I GO WHERE PEOPLE ARE I HOPE PEOPLE WHEN I NEED A FARSI FACULTY OR LONG FACULTY I DON'T PLACE AN AD I TRY TO GET AND COMMUNITY THOUGHT WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ENOUGH. TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE SO YOU CAN'T HAVE FACULTY OF COLOR AND AND STAFF OF COLOR IF YOU DON'T THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTS. AND SO THAT'S A HUGE PART OF WHAT I DO EVERYDAY I'M VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT THAT AND I LOOK AT THE OUR ALLY FOR LIKE WHEN I SPEND THE MONEY OR WHEN I GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. A WHAT I CHOOSE TO DO AS FAR AS RECRUITMENT. SO THAT'S HUGE AND THEN AS THE PRESIDENT OF BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF UNDERSTANDING ON WONDERFUL PEOPLE WITH WONDERFUL WORK AND FOR TWENTY YEARS THEY THOUGHT ABOUT. ME BEFORE I EVEN KNEW ABOUT LET'S REELS AND SO I AM JUST TRYING TO PUSH THAT WE DO A LOT OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT MOST OF OUR MEMBERS A STEEP ANY MOSHE. AND FUENTE AND MESA AND TO THE WORKING STUDENTS EVERY DAY TO THIS END. AND SO WE SUPPORT THEM WE ALSO DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH. TO MAKE OPPORTUNITIES UP MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR FACULTY AND STAFF AND THEN. HARD. HITTING HOW TO MOCK INTERVIEWS AND EXAMPLE OF HOW PANEL TO RUN FOR THE PEOPLE CAN COMPETE WHEN THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS. FOR LOS REELS WE TRACK EQUITY -- IN OUR DEMOGRAPHICS SO WHO APPLIED WHO WITH INTERVIEW WHO WAS HIRED AND SO WE CAN REALLY GET A FORM AND SENSE OF EACH COMEDIAN WHAT'S HAPPENING. SO I THINK THAT TRACKING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL I'M HOLDING COMMITTEES ACCOUNTABLE HOLDEN H. R. ACCOUNTABLE IT'S A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE DOING ON THE FRONT END. AND THEN THE SUPPORT FOR EVALUATION AND PROMOTION AND DEVELOPMENT ON THE BACK IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF FACULTY AND STAFF WHO GET IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEY DON'T STAY -- THERE'S THIS QUOTE THAT SAYS I DON'T WANT TO GO WHERE I'M TOLERATE AWARE CELEBRATED HUGE DIFFERENCE AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FIFTY GROUPS TO CREATE THAT COMMUNITY THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL KEEP FACULTY SELECTS THAT RETENTION PIECE. I'M SO THOSE ARE THAT THAT'S THE MODEL THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE ARE DOING THE WORK EVERYDAY LIKE DOCTOR MARSHALL. I'M IN FACT HIS HIS TO HIS SIBLINGS ARE IN OUR LOS REELS AND THEY ARE AND THEY STARTED BLACK FACULTY STAFF YEARS AGO. AFTER THE COMMUNITY IS IS STILL WORKING ON VERY DIFFERENT ENDS AND I AM ON THAT FRONT IN I'M WITH THE RECRUITMENT AND OVERSEEING THIS PROCESS AND IN THE TEAM AND STAFF THAT DOES THAT. SO THANK YOU YES [inaudible] MISTER WILLIAMS. CHAIR MEMBERS DOCTRINES LE WILLIAM PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AND PUBLIC POLICY AT SEXY COLLEGE UC DAVIS CSU SACRAMENTO. SEE IF T. L. I SEE A T. LOCAL TWO TWO SEVEN NINE AT DESTRUCTIVE READ. BECAUSE SECOND GO SWIFTLY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE OBSTACLES TO BECOMING A TEACHER. HOW HARD IS IT TO BREAK INTO THE INDUSTRY? TO ART. RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED IN ADEQUATE TEACHERS SUPPORT UNFAIR HUMAN RESOURCES RECRUITING AND HIRING PRACTICES. AND POOR PERCEPTION OF TEACHING TO BE THE PRIMARY OBSTACLES TO BECOMING AN REMAINING A TEACHER. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE START STARTING TEACHERS ON A HIGHER STEP ON THE SALARY SCALE. PROVIDING MENTORING AND COACHING SUPPORT BY BLACK TEACHERS ACTIVELY RECRUITING FROM H. B. C. USE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WHEN I GRADUATED FROM UC DAVIS I FACE THESE OBSTACLES BUT I HAD A BACKGROUND IN PUBLIC POLICY FROM HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIP WITH THE SOME THE MEMBERS WHEN MORE AND WANTING TO MAKE DONALD? THE INTERNSHIP FUEL MY PASSION FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY WHICH OFFICIALLY LET ME BACK TO TEACHING. IN THE INTERIM I EARNED A MASTER'S AND DOCTORATE DEGREE IN EDUCATION. BUT I WAS DIRECTLY RECRUITED INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION BY DOLLY GREEN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO RAN THE LOS REELS FACULTY DIVERSITY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. PROGRAMS LIKE THESE WHO INTENTIONALLY RECRUIT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS ARE INDISPENSABLE THE F. B. I. P. PROGRAM SHOULD BE REPLICATED STATE WHY. MS GREEN BY INTENTIONALLY RECRUITING ME THIRTEEN YEARS AGO WAS ON TO SOMETHING THIS SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IS IN TWENTY NINETEEN VALIDATED. A RECENT JOHN OP AND STUDY ON THE EFFICACY OF SAME RACE TEACHERS ESTABLISH THAT. ONE LOW INCOME BLACK STUDENTS WHO HAVE AT LEAST ONE BLACK TEACHER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND CONSIDER ATTENDING COLLEGE. TWO BLACK STUDENTS MATCH WITH BLACK TEACHERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE% HIGHER TEST SCORES. THREE SPENDING JUST ONE YEAR WITH THE TEACHER OF THE SAME RACE CAN MOVE THE DIAL. ON ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING WE PERSISTENT GAPS IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. THAT OF LOW INCOME BLACK BOYS BLACK TEACHERS DON'T ONLY MOVE THE DIAL THEY MOVE THE DIAL DRAMATICALLY. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF BLACK TEACHERS CALIFORNIA MAYOR IS THE NATION IN CALIFORNIA OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE TEACHERS TWELVE THOUSAND ARE BLACK. BLACK TEACHERS MAKE UP 3% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF TEACHERS BLACK STUDENTS MAKE UP 5% OF THE TOTAL STUDENT POPULATION. NATIONALLY EIGHT OUT OF TEN TEACHERS ARE WHITE WHILE FEWER THAN ONE IN TEN ARE BLACK. THESE STATISTICS STAND IN SHARP CONTRAST TO STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS IN US PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OR 47% OF CHILDREN ARE WHITE AND BLACK TEACHERS NATIONALLY WOULD NEED TO MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND TO ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND IF THEIR SHARE OF THE EDUCATED WORKFORCE. WHAT A MATCH THAT OF THE BLACK STUDENTS RELATIVE TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL POPULATION? IT OF ALL THE OBSTACLES TO BECOMING A TEACHER NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT TO NOTE. RECENT RESEARCH FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND BIAS IN SCHOOL DISTRICT HIRING PRACTICES ARE MAJOR OBSTACLE. DR DIANE WHITMORE STUDIED A COURT ORDERED DESEGREGATION CASE FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE HER QUESTION HOW QUICKLY WAS DISTRICT POLICY ABLE TO MAKE A CHANGE IN ULTIMATELY. HOW DID THAT IMPACT STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT? FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE DISTRICT HAD ON HAVE RETIRED A SMALLER PORTION OF BLACK TEACHERS NINETEEN POINT 8% THEN HAD OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE TWENTY FOUR POINT 1%. AFTER THE COURT ORDERED CRITERIA WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY TEN THE NUMBER OF BLACK TEACHERS HIRED SPIKE DRAMATICALLY. BY TWENTY FOURTEEN NEW HIRES AND JUSTICE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK THIRTY TWO POINT 2% THE NEW TEACHERS ARE HIRED STATE WHY TWENTY ONE POINT THE INFLUX OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN EDUCATORS WAS ABLE TO SHRINK THE BLACK STUDENT TO BLACK TEACHER RATIO AND REDUCE THE REPRESENTATION CAP BY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS. AND THE BLACK WHITE ACHIEVEMENT GAP DISPARITY IN TEST SCORES NARAL BY 5% [inaudible] RECOMMENDATIONS. FOCUS ON PRACTICES BY EXEMPLARY DISTRICTS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. FOR DISTRICTS EXPAND YOUR RECRUITMENT POOL DEVELOP SYSTEMIC CONSISTENT WAYS OF RECRUITING INTERVIEWING HIRING AND RETAINING TEACHERS. DISTRICTS AND POLICY MAKERS. REFORM HIRING PROTOCOL AND PRACTICES FOCUS ON DIVERSITY FUND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOSTER A SYSTEMIC CULTURE OF VALUING TEACHERS OF COLOR. EXPAND AB TWO FOUR ONE COM LONGER DOUBLE IMPLICIT BIAS TRYING TO APPLY TO DISTRICTS TEACHER EDUCATION AND PREPARATION PROGRAMS. THERE IS IN FACT A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE WKA KELLOGG FOUNDATION AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE IT'S THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A THREE YEAR GRANT. IT'S CALLED THE MINORITY MALE TEACHERS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON INTENTIONALLY RECRUITING RETAINING AND SUPPORTING BLACK AND BROWN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SUPPORT SEE IF YOU USE EFFORTS. AND REPLICATE ALL TO ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. NONTRADITIONAL TEACHER EDUCATION AND PREPARATION PROGRAMS LIKE FORTUNE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION FORMALLY PROJECT PIPELINE. INTEREST IN ITS PRE SERVICE AND DISTRICT INTERN CURRICULUM. FOCUSED ON PREPARING TEACHERS TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE AS A TWO POINT TWO PLUS TWO PLUS THREE PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO BECOME LAWYERS ABOUT GEORGE LAW SCHOOL. THIS TYPE OF PIPELINE PROGRAM MUST BE CREATED FOR TEACHER EDUCATION. SEE IF YOU SACRAMENTO EDUCATION PROGRAM AND PROGRAMMING LED BY DR JULIAN HELICOPTER TO HOLD THE CHAVEZ AND DOCTOR DEAN CALLIN. WILL BE A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE TWO PLUS TWO PLUS TWO PROGRAM TO CREATE A GUARANTEE TRANSFER PROGRAM FOR SPYING TEACHERS. ALL OF THE SPEAKERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ARE RUNNING SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT WILL CREATE THE TEACHERS THAT WILL HELP IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE TO DESERVE YOUR INVESTIGATION SUPPORT AND REPLICATION. THANK YOU. SO GIVE QUESTION SCREWED I APOLOGIZE REPEAT YOUR NAME FOR ME ANGELA WILLIAMS THANK YOU. FORGET WHICH WAY THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. SOME OF THE DISORDER WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT WE KNOW THAT. STUDENTS WHO HAVE A TEACHER WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT I THINK BECAUSE OF LONG STANDING BIASES POLICIES WE'VE. THE SYSTEM. IS WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH GETTING SORT OF TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOLS THEY NEED TO BE AND AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE STRUGGLING IN THE LOWER ECONOMIC. END OF THE SCALE TEND TO BE THE ONES THAT HAVE HIGHER POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS OF COLOR SO WE NEED TO PUT TEACHERS THERE. WE KNOW THAT. AND YET WE AND WE PUT TEACHERS IN THOSE CLASSROOMS. THAT -- TEND TO BE LESS EXPERIENCE THAN THE MENTOR TEACHERS ME THIS THIS IS SORT OF THE THING THAT WE HAVE PERPETUATED. SO IF WE'RE GONNA PUT. NEWER TEACHERS AND WE RECRUIT THESE TEACHERS AND WE DO A REALLY GOOD JOB BY DEFINITION THOSE ARE GOING TO BE YOUNG TEACHERS NEWER TEACHERS. AND THEY CAN BENEFIT THE STUDENTS BUT WHO'S NOW BENEFITING THOSE TEACHERS. AND SO FOR FOR A TEACHER. I'M ASSUMING THE TEACHER IS IS ALSO SO IN AT A BLACK TEACHER HAVING A BLACK TEACHER MENTOR WOULD BE IDEAL. HOW DO YOUNG TEACHERS RESPOND THOUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY? BLACK MENTOR TEACHERS WERE GONNA HAVE WHITE MENTOR TEACHERS OR OTHERS HOW WELL DO THOSE YOUNG TEACHERS RESPOND TO MENTORS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE. THEY DO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT TO GET OVER THIS HURDLE. SO WE HAVE SOME SOME SYSTEM OF THINGS WE HAVE TO OVERCOME. AND I AM VERY DISTURBED BY. SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE BISON RECRUITING IN THE VICE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BRING. TEACHERS INTO THIS PIPELINE. BUT IT WE DON'T BY DEFINITION HAVE THE THAT THE RIGHT SUPPORTS FOR THOSE TEACHERS. WE'RE GONNA LIMP ALONG HOW DO WE DO THAT HOW DO WE CREATE THE SYSTEM THAT THAT ENDS UP LOOKING THE WAY IT'S GOING TO NEED. TO THAT WE CAN THEN BRING INTO THAT PIPELINE. THE RATE. THE RIGHT TEACHERS SO THAT THEY CAN THEN BECOME THOSE TEACHER MENTORS THAT OTHERS MAY BE LOOKING MORE BROADLY SO NOT JUST TEACHERS THAT LOOKS SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A FARLEY STUDY THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- STUDENTS THAT A TEACHER I DIVERSE TEACHER NOT EVEN NECESSARILY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT STILL BENEFIT ME AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN MAYBE MORE BROADLY SO NOT EXACTL A MATCH AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THE EMPLOYMENT HOLD AFFINITY HOLE. SO I AM THAT TWENTY YEAR VETERAN STAFF MEMBER COULD ALSO BE OF ASSISTANCE TO A NEW TEACHER DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN LOOK AT THE WHOLE. AND SO IF I'M IN LIKE THAT COULD IN STAFF AND THERE'S SOMEONE IN THAT GROUP THAT CAN SUPPORT ME I SUPPORT DEANS AND ADMINISTRATORS ALL THE TIME AND I'M NOT A D. NORMAN STRAIGHTER R FACULTY BUT I SUPPORT THEM ALL THE TIME. AND SO WITH THAT CAN HAPPEN I THINK THE COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT'S A ONE PIECE THAT WE CAN JUST BROADEN THAT. AND SO THAT YOU'RE GETTINGWHAT YOU NEED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE VERSUS ONE MENTOR KIND OF RENT CONTROL. I THINK THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT BLACK TEACHERS. NOT MORE SPECIAL NOT LESS SPECIAL TO SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT BLACK TEACHERS PARTICULARLY BLACK MALE TEACHERS. I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE STEREOTYPES IN SOCIETY SO. I'M AN UNUSUAL SUSPECT SOMEONE ACTUAL OPEN CLASS WHETHER THEY'RE BLACK STUDENTS OR OTHER STUDENTS. I GET A LOOK. WHO'S THIS GUY RIGHT. THAT LOOK ACTUALLY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOW THE DATA AND THE REPORTS IN THE RESEARCH AND JOHN OFTEN SIMPLY. LOOKS AT THE A PRETTY INTENSIVE STUDY. OF HOW DO WE GET OVER THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND SO THE DATA IS THE DATA RIGHT BLACK TEACHERS WITH BLACK STUDENTS. THE QUITE LITERALLY RIGHT AND I CAN BEGIN THE DISTURBING A COPY TO REPORT TO LOOK AT THE FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE TO SNIFF AGAINST THE POPULATION SIZE BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT I THINK. THAT -- ELEVATING THE TEACHING PROFESSION -- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ATTRACT EVERYONE TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION -- OF THIS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH -- ONE SUGGESTION THAT I MADE ABOUT STARTING STARTING TEACHERS OFF AT A HIGHER SALARY STEP. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I THINK THAT -- ANY GOOD TEACHER A PARTICULARLY GOOD TEACHER MENTORS ARE A A DEEP VALUE TO ANY TEACHER. I THINK ONE FIX AS IT RELATES TO TRYING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BLACK TEACHERS TO BLACK TEACHER MENTORS IS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE. THE BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF ASSOCIATION -- THE BEAUTY OF ALL THESE SOLUTIONS IS THAT IT TAKES A VILLAGE AND THEREFORE YOU NEED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS NGOS SOCIAL SERVICES SO I COULD IMAGINE A CASE WHERE. THE DISTRICT HAS HIRING POLICY RIGHT AND INTENTIONALLY GOES AFTER AFRICAN AMERICAN TEACHERS AND THE BLACK FACULTY AND STAFF ASSOCIATION WHICH SHOULD BE REPLICATED TO ALL A HUNDRED AND TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS WITHIN BE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM TO GIVE THEM THE INTENSIVE. KIND OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT MAKES THEM EXPERT TEACHERS AND IT MIGHT I ADD TO THE EQUITY MINDEDNESS IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT SO YOU DON'T SO THAT EVEN A MENTOR TEACHER WHO ISN'T OF THE SAME RACE BUT IT EQUITY MIND IT. REALLY IMPACTS AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN A RECRUITMENT PRACTICES DIVERSE PEOPLE APPLICANTS AT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO INCLUSION SOCIAL JUSTICE EQUITY MINDEDNESS TO THOSE. IN BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SMALL POPULATIONS WE WE NEED TO BROADEN THE NETWORK AS WELL SO THAT THOSE MENTORS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ON THE SAME CAMPUS THAT WOULD BE IDEA. BUT WE WE HAVE. A SYSTEM STRUCTURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OVER COME OVER TIME AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE TO BE. AWARE OF THAT BUT ALSO SINCE WE LOCK UP UPWARDS OF 30% OF YOUNG BLACK MEN [inaudible] WHAT WE'RE? MAKING THAT POOL SMALLER AND SMALLER WHEN THAT BECOMES THEN A VERY HIGH VALUE COMMODITY. TO BRING IN AND THEN STRATEGICALLY GET INTO OUR SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO TEACH SO THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE WERE WORKING ON AND I WAS GLAD YOU MENTIONED ARE. INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTION. THE PIPELINE OF TRYING TO GET FOLKS OF COLOR I I CHAIR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS RIGHT NOW IS DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. IT IS A VERY WHITE MALE PROFESSION. TO OVERCOME THAT IT WILL WELL WE STARTED THAT INCLUDE LOOKING AT JUDICIAL RANKS. BEEN LOOKING AT THE LEGAL PROFESSION THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO KIDS AND HOW WE FEEL THAT PIPELINES WERE TRY TO FILL PIPELINES FOR SCHOOLS. BUT ALSO TRYING TO FILL PIPELINES IN VARIOUS OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY DIVERSE AND THAT HAS A BIG IMPACT IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE TEND TO WALK UP. AND SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MEN OF COLOR BECAUSE THE LEGAL SYSTEM DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY DO YOU AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM SO WE HAVE. VARIOUS SYSTEMSTHAT DESPERATELY DESPERATELY NEED CHANGE IF WE CAN DO THAT I THINK WE CAN START TO MAKE THE NUMBERS LOOK BETTER. BUT OVER COMING BACK. IS IS ALTERNATELY A BIG CHALLENGES MENTION IN BRIEF OF THAT WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA. YES THE KEY TO UNDERSTAND AND I KNOW LEGISLATORS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REPEALS OF PROP. THIRTEEN AND LOOKING AT SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT PROP TWO OH NINE I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AGAIN USED TO BE A PARTICULAR KIND OF LEADER. WHEN IT CAME TO DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES WHERE ACTUALLY REPRESENTATION MATTERED MOST IN ALL PROFESSIONS AND THEY WERE PIPELINE? SO I THINK TWO NINE IS WHAT IT IS BUT I DO THINK THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING MORE INTENTIONAL AS A STATE TO REALLY FOCUS ON HIGH VALUE INDIVIDUALS IF WE KNOW THE BLACK MALE TEACHERS. ACCORDING TO JOHN HOPKINS STUDY INCREASES NOT ALL OF THE TEST SCORES BUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT STUDENTS WILL ACTUALLY GRADUATE AND WE NEED TO VALUE THOSE MEN THAT ARE LOCKED UP IN PRISON AS TEACHERS. WE CAN CHANGE OUR FRAME. THAT THESE ARE FUTURE TEACHERS AND THEN AGAIN WORK WITH C. R. C. AND C. R. C. -- TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION PROGRAMS RIGHT IN PARTICULAR IN PRISON WHEN THEY CAN'T GET THE KIND OF PRE SERVICE DISTRICT IN TURN SERVICE I KNOW. IT MAY SEEM LIKE A PHENOMENAL TO SAY HEY A FORMER FELON IS NOW IN THE DISTRICT INTERN PROGRAM BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. IT ABSOLUTELY IS AND AND THIS IS YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AUDIENCE AND THAT THE MAKE UP OF THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF IT IS IS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE HEARING SOME THINGS IT AND WE HAVE TALKED OURSELVES OUT OF TALKING ABOUT. REYES WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POLICY PROP TWO NINE AND OTHERS I THINK OR THAT WOULD WHEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT RACE THE RACES SWEAT. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. AND WE HAVE TALKED HERSELF INTO THAT THAT WE HAVE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM AND WE HAVE IT IN USE GO INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT VERY APPARENTLY AND YET WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ADDED TO QUITE A BIT ABOUT. WHO WERE GOING TO ACCEPT WE HAD DEBATE AROUND JURORS WE HAD DEBATE AROUND HIM AND AND WHO'S ALLOWED TO SERVE AS A JUROR WHO'S ALLOWED TO VOTE? AND WHY WE ARE EXCLUDING VERY LARGE PARTS OF SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AS WE CREATE THOSE POLICIES AND THAT'S ALL A PIECE OF THAT WHO'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND TO THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT YOUR TRYING TO PROMOTE WHAT HISTORICALLY PEOPLE WHO APPLY FOR POSITIONS COULD AND IF THEY HAD FELONY CONVICTIONS RIGHT SO THAT. THAT WAS THE BERRY SO YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE THESE PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE AND TEACHING CURRENTLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS WHEN YOU WALK UP 30% OF THAT POTENTIAL POOL WOULD WE EXPECT. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. THANK YOU OKAY. TURNED BACK TOWARD CHAIR THANK GOD MY GAVEL BACK HOW. VIKINGS IS DOWN PAN AYE. FEEL COMPEL I APPRECIATE CONNECTING THE CONCEPT OF TEACHING AND MENTORING. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION OF BRING PEOPLE INTO TEACHING BUT I THINK THAT GET YOU INTO THE REALM OF THIS MYSTERY OF THE HUMAN CHEMISTRY. AND I THINK -- FOR PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING I'LL JUST POINT OUT. THAT THERE IS A ME. AND MENTOR IN. AND I THINK A CHILD. NEEDS TO SEE PEOPLE THAT THEY IDENTIFY WITH IN SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF THIS. LOTS OF KIDS COULD GO TO SCHOOL SEE BILL THEY WOULD IDENTIFY BUT FOR THIS POPULATION. NOT SELL. IT'S IT'S AN INSTANT THING MY BEST MAN. WHEN CITY AND I GOT MARRIED SO LONG AGO -- THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIEND OF MINE GARY WILLIAMS WENT ON TO TEACH HIS WHOLE CAREER IN PACIFIC GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHICH IS NOT THE MOST URBAN CHALLENGED DISTRICT. BUT STILL WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN GARY WAS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON HIS SCHOOL DISTRICT. FOR THE KIDS GROWING UP IN PACIFIC GROVE. ARE YEAH I THINK THIS IDEA. MENTOR AND VERY POWERFUL CONCEPT ALLY WITH TEACHING. BUT YOU DO NEED TO FIND. THE ME AND MENTORING KIDS NEED TO SEE SOMEONE SO THAT STATISTICS ABOUT HAVING JUST A SINGLE. AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE TEACHER WHEN YOU'RE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IS LIKE WOW. YEAH MEDIAN MENTOR WHILE. I APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING THAT TODAY. Q. THANK YOU AND I'M IN MY MY ISSUES A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL -- MY SON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY ON HE'S A TEACHER AT CHARLES TRUE SCIENCE MAGNET AND WHAT -- IS THE ONE I SAID GRADUATE DEGREE IN BIOLOGY AND MATH -- WHEN HE GRADUATED -- I TALKED TO THEN SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DACEY AND TOLD ABOUT MY SON. HE SAID WE NEED TO GET HIM. INTO THE SYSTEM THE TJ MAX IS TEACHING AP MAP THEY JUST TOTAL WILL BE TEACHING AP MATH AND AP BIOLOGY AT CHARLES DREW. AND SO THERE'S A PRE TRAINING YOU NEED TO DO AND THAT'S WHY COULD MAKE IT THIS WEEK -- I KNOW. WITH THAT SKILL SET. IF HE HAD IN FOOTBALL BASKETBALL IT WAS IN A LIMO TO GO PICK THEM UP AT THE AIRPORT IT WILL BE A IN AT AN ABA DRAFT. FOR HIM TO BE AN DRAFT AND I'M PRETTY SURE WILL BE PICKED UP IN THE FIRST ROUND. IN BE MAKING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. IT TOOK HIM CLOSE TO THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO GET HIRED. I'M TOM BOUT THE BUREAUCRACY. OKAY -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. WHO CAN TEACH AP BIOLOGY? AND HE CAN'T GET A JOB WITH. THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. YES IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M SAYING MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR MY SON AND AND I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD BE AN EXTREME ASSET. TO LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- EVENTUALLY GOT IN BUT IT SHOULD NOT TAKE JERRY AND A LOT OF YEAR ALL PUSH THAT HARDER WANT TO AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO. ARE SERVING A WHO NEED TO BE THERE RIGHT AND I NEED HIM OFF MY PAYROLL SHE THE NEWS THAT. SO I I PAINFULLY KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE -- MISSED YOUR THE CHARTER SCHOOLS PICKED HIM UP ALMOST A DAY RIGHT [inaudible] AND NOTHING WRONG WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WE NEED A P. TEACHERS THERE. TOO BUT WE REALLY NEED A P. TEACHERS AND WALKS THROUGH REALLY NEED MALE ROLE MODEL HUMM IN M. YOU TELL ME WHAT PERCENT OR SOMEONE SAY LIKE 1% OF THE TEACHERS AFTER AMERICAN MALE. HOW MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE AP BIOLOGY TEACHERS ARE IN THE WHOLE STATE? YEAH YES YEAH BECAUSE HE'S HAD SOME WOULD SET THE COUNTRY -- AGAIN I YOU WERE PLAYING SPORTS WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION THIS IS. I I DON'T KNOW IF THE BUREAUCRACY THAT. THAT KEPT HIM OUT. SO HOW DO YOU YEAH HOW YOU WORK WITH THAT. MEASURE JUST WANT TO MENTION BRIEFLY THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND SEE ISSUED NORTHRIDGE WITH THE DEPUTY CAL UP TO BE K. KELLOGG FOUNDATION. IS A MINORITY TEACHER PROJECT I THINK THAT'S EXEMPLARY I WON BECAUSE IT'S IN THE CSU SYSTEM IN THE CSU DOES SO MUCH TO EDUCATE ONE IN EIGHT EDUCATORS IN TEACHING CALIFORNIA. HAVE COME FROM THE C. ISSUE AND THEY ARE NOW INTENTIONALLY WORKING WITH ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE YEAR -- PROGRAM AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY BUT THEY'RE DOING IT ANYWAY AND THEY'VE GOT TO GET IN THE DEBATE QUE KELLOGG FOUNDATION IS IN MICHIGAN. THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT I THINK ARE BAKED INTO THE PRE SERVICE AND DISTRICT IN TURN PROCESS BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE TO AFTER THEY GO TO THE PRE SERVICE AND IS AGAIN TERM PROCESS. THEY DO HAVE TO PASS PARTICULAR TESTS RIGHT THEY DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. AND SO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH EXPERTS LIKE THE CSU EDUCATION EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS. AROUND FIGURING OUT HOW -- THE THE FREE SERVICE AND DISTRICT IN TURN SERVICE CAN TURN INTO -- AN ACTUAL FULL TIME JOB NOW WHEN THEY BECOME DISTRICT INTERNS THEY'RE ACTUALLY PLACED. IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WILL THEY STAY THAT'S BASED UPON WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF COMPLETING THE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO BE A FULLY CERTIFIED TEACHER. BUT I THINK THAT CONVERSATION IN YOUR THAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE NOT JUST A ONE OFF. IT'S A SYSTEM WIDE ISSUE AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT IS TO GET A SYSTEM WIDE ORGANIZATION LIKE SEE ISSUE ENGAGED. WITH THE EXPERTS THAT ARE THERE TO REALLY FOCUS ON HOW DO WE CREATE THAT KIND OF VALUE ADDED KNOWING THAT. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE TEACHER TEACHING MATH CALCULUS SCIENCE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOR SERIOUS ABOUT STEM AND STEAM. AND I THINK SEE ISSUE WITH WOULD BE THE PERFECT PARTNER TO THINK THROUGH HOW DO WE VALUE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN. THAT ARE TEACHERS THAT WANT TO COME INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION NOT JUST LOOTED COULD NOT TO WORK THAT HARD. ONE BOB THIS IS AFTER YOU PASS TO SEE BEST. IT TOOK HIM TWO YEARS TO GET INTO THAT PROGRAM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN IT TOOK. SOME TIME BEFORE IT BECAME A PERMANENT TEACHER YES. HE WENT TO MORE HOUSE IN BIOLOGY IS THE HARDEST DEGREE YOU CAN GET. IN ANY HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND MORE HOUSES BIOLOGY DEGREE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST TO GET IN ANY HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE. GO TO A STARK BLACK COLLEGES AND RECRUIT. WHY WITH WHAT? DESPITE WHAT WHAT WHAT SOMEBODY FROM I WOULD TASTE SOMEBODY FROM ARKANSAS STATE WE LOVE THE COME OUT HERE. AND TEACH -- AND AND OTHER PLACES AND SO -- WE WE MAKE WE MAKE IT HARDER ON OURSELVES SOMETIMES DANCE IS JUST RIGHT THERE WE JUST DON'T DO IT. AND SO -- BEEN IN AND HAVING INTERNSHIPS OR WHERE YOU COULD GOTO A MORE HOUSE FROM CAL STATE. AND THEN COME BACK HERE AND FINISH YOUR YOUR TEACHING COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL BUT WE JUST NEEDED TO DO A BETTER SANDRA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THEN ARE FOR IT. OUR LAST PANEL [inaudible] OF RETAINING. TEACHER RETENTION. RETAINING TEACHERS TO IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AB DOUBLE WALK INS. AND ANTHONY. ERIN DILLON ERA WHEN Y. AIRLINE THEY PUT A Ã£ ON HERE OKAY THAT'S RIGHT CITY. SO -- I'M SITTING BACK THERE THE AMEN CORNER. SO LET'S THAT HAS BEEN SAID IS IN MY ACTUAL MY NOTES. AND I TALK A LOT SO I WROTE MINE DOWN. SO THAT I COULD GET THROUGH IN MY FIVE MINUTES SO -- I'VE COME TO THE FRIGHTENING CONCLUSION THAT I AM THE DECISIVE ELEMENT IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S MY PERSONAL APPROACH THAT CREATES THE CLIMATE. IT'S MY DAILY MOOD THAT MAKES THE WEATHER. AS A TEACHER I POSSESS A TREMENDOUS POWER TO MAKE A CHILD'S LIFE MISERABLE OR IF CHOI WITH. I CAN BE A TOOL OF TORTURE ONE INSTRUMENT OF INSPIRATION. I CAN HUMILIATE OR HE'LL. IT ALL SITUATION IT IS MY RESPONSE. WILL BE ESCALATED. OR DE ESCALATED. AND A CHILD HUMANIZED. OR DE HUMANIZED AND THAT'S FROM I'M GET OUT. I BEGIN CHAPTER. TWO OF MY BOOK. THOUGHT HELD HOSTAGE A BLACK TEACHES JOURNEY OF UNLOCKING YOUR LINES WITH THIS POWERFUL QUOTE. THE CHAPTER IS ENTITLED THEY WERE THE ONES TEACHERS WHO INFLUENCED MY JOURNEY. AND I PROFILE SEVEN TEACHERS WHO AYE CHANNEL IN MY OWN TEACHING. ALL OF MY TEACHERS WERE WHITE. K. THROUGH. TWELVE AND I THRIVED UNDER THEIR TUTELAGE. BUT MY DARK SKIN BROTHER. JUST ONE YEAR BEHIND ME. WAS TRAUMATIZED BY MOST OF THEM. AND PLACED ON THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN KINDERGARTEN. BECAUSE HE WAS MISUNDERSTOOD. AND LABELED OPPOSITIONAL. LET ME START AT THE ONSET OF MY JOURNEY. AFTER GRADUATING FROM THE STANFORD TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I'M ALL. WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE IN EDUCATION. AND LIFETIME TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN ENGLISH FRENCH AND PSYCHOLOGY. I STARTED TEACHING IN THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SILICON VALLEY. THE EAST SIDE UNION. AT THAT TIME THE AVERAGE GPA FOR BLACK STUDENTS WAS ONE POINT. FIVE WHEN I RETIRED SEVEN YEARS EARLY FROM THAT DISTRICT EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE AVERAGE GPA FOR BLACK STUDENTS WITH ONE POINT. NINE THAT IS CRIMINAL. IN ORDER TO COMBAT THIS TRAVESTY. I WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALLIANCE A BLACK EDUCATORS THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. AND ONE OF OUR SIGNATURE EVENTS WAS AN ANNUAL STUDENT AWARDS CEREMONY HONORING HUNDREDS OF BLACK STUDENTS TRANSITIONING FROM FIFTH SIXTH. EIGHTH AND TWELFTH GRADES WE CELEBRATED OUR THIRTIETH YEAR LAST MONTH. I WAS STILL JUST A BANDAID. SO AFTER SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALLIANCE A BLACK EDUCATORS FROM NINETY FOUR TO THE OTHER ONE I FOUND AT THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN EDUCATORS NOW CALLED A BLACK EDUCATION NETWORK. IF I HAD WITNESSED FIRST HAND THE POWER OF THE TEACHER TO HUMAN LIFE OR DE HUMANIZE. I COLD CALLED I COLD CALLED DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND. WHO HAD ARRIVED TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY IF YOU USE A FEW YEARS EARLIER AND ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HELP ME TO CREATE A SUMMER INSTITUTE FOCUS ON EQUIPPING TEACHERS TO SUCCESSFULLY REACH? STUDENTS OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY. LINDA NEVER HESITATED AND EVEN UNDER WROTE THE INSTITUTES FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AS PART OF A LARGE GRANT THAT SHE HAD FOR HER SCHOOL WE DESIGN NETWORK. FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE FEATURE TO ROCK STARS IN EDUCATION AT OUR INSTITUTE AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FLOCK TO THEM. MANY OF THE FEATURES SCHOLARS HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS THAT ARE USED IN SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY INCLUDED DOCTORS BOB MOSES TWICE. BEVERLY DANIEL TATUM GLORIA LADSON BILLINGS PAGE ON THE GEAR. WAIT NOBLES LISA DELPY SURE ROCKY ALI CAROL LEE AND JUDY THE GAY. ALTHOUGH THE INCIDENTS WERE HIGHLY ACCLAIMED MANY ATTENDEES SHARE WITH ME THAT THEY WERE NOT GETTING TRACTION IN THE FIELD. WHAT THE GREAT PRACTICES THAT THEY WERE LEARNING DUE TO SYSTEMIC RACISM? SO WE TOOK A HIATUS FOR FOUR YEARS AND WORKED ON STATEWIDE POLICY. DURING THIS TIME THE LOCAL UNTIL FUNDING FORMULA WITH. AND THAT WAS PRECISELY THE POLICY MANDATE THAT WE NEEDED. FOUR YEARS AGO WE RESUMED THE HOSTING THE INSTITUTES IN A FEATURED. DOCTORS ARE NEED THE BALL STEVEN HANCOCK BEVERLY DATA TATUM A SECOND TIME AND BRIAN BROWN MORE ROCK STARS. OUR INSTITUTE FOCUS ON PREPARING TEACHERS WITH ACTIVELY DELIVER HERITAGE KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRICULUM. THAT'S ENHANCING STUDENT LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT AND REDUCING HARSH DISCIPLINE AND SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION DISPARITIES THAT FUEL THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORT AFTER REPORT AFTER REPORT ABOUT IMPACT FOR THE INSTITUTES HAVE BEEN ON HELPING TEACHER. IMPROVE TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE CONSIDER WAYS THE SCALE WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO HELP IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO I STARTED IF THE PROGRAM IN THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY. UNAPOLOGETICALLY FOCUSED ON BLACK STUDENTS. 1100% OF OUR STUDENTS. IN ROLE IN COLLEGE. 90% GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS WOULD BE A OR B. F. DEGREES. 60% EARNED DEGREES IN STEM WHICH IS EIGHT TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR BLACK STUDENTS. WITH THE RACE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. THERE IS NO REASON WHY THIS SELECT COMMITTEE CAN'T DO THE THING. AS FAR AS TEACHER RECRUITMENT IS CONCERNED WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS SELECT COMMITTEE CONSIDER HELPING TO CREATE FUTURE TEACHERS FOR BLACK AMERICA CHAPTERS. ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES AROUND THE STATE. THEY WILL BE WILL BE MODELED AFTER FUTURE TEACHERS OF AMERICA. BUT THEY WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON BLACK STUDENTS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BECOME TEACHERS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND CULTIVATING ALLIANCES WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES H. B. C. USE TO ENCOURAGE THEIR EDUCATION MAJORS TO TEACH IN CALIFORNIA. TO HELP THEM WITH THE COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE THIS SELECT COMMITTEE SHOULD OFFER HOUSING SUPPORT. AS LONG AS THE POTENTIAL TEACHER COMMITS TO WORKING AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WHERE AT LEAST 10% OF THE POPULATION IS BLACK. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GROUND BREAKING STUDY CO AUTHORED BY JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ECONOMIST FOUND THAT HAVING JUST ONE BLACK TEACHER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED A LOW INCOME BLACK STUDENTS THE LIKELIHOOD. OF GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN CONSIDERING COLLEGE. FOR A VERY LOW INCOME BOYS THE RISK OF DROPPING OUT WAS REDUCED BY 939%. FINALLY I RECOMMEND THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE EMBRACE THE POWERFUL WORK OF THE DIGNITY THE SCHOOLS CAMPAIGN. WHOSE MISSION IS TO DISMANTLE FORTY TWO COUNCIL I HELP GUIDE ITS WORK. WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY HUNDRED AND TWELVE MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IF EVERY SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY MERELY ADOPTED DS SEES MODEL COLD AND IMPLEMENTED IT WELL. WE WOULD IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN A FEW YEARS. IN TENTH GRADE MY BROTHER CAUGHT WITH CALL THE IN WIRED. BY A WHITE TEACHER. ANY THROUGH A DESK IN HER. IT WAS EXPELLED FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. OF MY MOTHER'S TEN CHILDREN HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL STARTED SELLING DRUGS AND WITH IN AND OUT OF JAIL. AT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS MURDERED. BY AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT. HECK EVEN ONE TEACHER RECOGNIZE THE GENIUS OF MY GIVE TO BROTHER. AND RESCUE HIM FROM THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. PERHAPS HE WOULD BE ALIVE AND THRIVING TODAY. BECAUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER IS COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO CONFRONT THE END OF THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE HEAD ON WITH HIS HEARING. A RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL COME OUT OF IT I'M GOING TO LAND HILL. THIS COPY OF MY BOOK. UNTIL LIKE IN ORDER HILL. ONE BETWEEN ITS PAGES. YOU WILL COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT RECRUITING DEVELOPING AND RETAINING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHERS IS A CRITICAL KEY TO ENDING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY TEST. THANK YOU. NEXT IS YOUR BOOK. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. YES IT DOES. WHEN I REYES SO I'M OPPOSITE OF HER I DON'T SPEAK LONG -- ANYWAY MY NAME IS ANTHONY AIRLINE AND I'M ACTUALLY A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS -- IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA WORKING BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT -- SO THEY ARE VERY PROUD OF I'VE. I WAS THINKING THAT REFLECT THE EARLIER ABOUT. IF I'VE EVER HAD A BLACK TEACHER. IN MY EDUCATIONAL CAREER I DON'T HAVE A BLACK TEACHER AND TAUGHT WITH IN TENTH GRADE. OF FEMALE WHO ACTUALLY INSPIRED ME TO BE A TEACHER JUST FOR HER SHOWING UP. TO ALL WHITE SCHOOL THEY DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE THERE TEACHING ENGLISH AND THAT WAS REALLY INSPIRING TO ME HER COURAGE. AND THEN I DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK MALE TEACHER AND SO GRAD SCHOOL. OF THE FIRST HARPER SAW BLACK NO TEACHER -- IN MY CAREER I TEACH KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE AND SECOND GRADE SO WHEN I SHOW UP THE KIDS ARE EXCITED KIDS RUNNING DOWN THE HALL CABIN YOUR CLASSROOM. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS A BLACK MALE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A BLACK MALE TEACHER BEFORE [inaudible] SO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO BE IN THE BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT BEING A ROLE MODEL FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND SHOWING THEM THAT THERE IS. PURPOSE AND VALUE IN BEING AS IN EDUCATION AND THAT THEY COULD BE TEACHER THAT THEY WANT TO BE -- YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT TO ASK IF YOU GAVE ME A BLANK CHECK AND I COULD. ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING I I ONE OF THE THINGS I'M PROUD OF IS I'M PART OF THE BLACK TEACHER PROJECT AND WHAT WE DO IS AFFINITY SPACE. OF PROGRAM FUNDED BY DOCTOR MISTER MOSELY -- IN NEW YORK CITY. IS SHE HAVE TWO CHAPTERS HERE IN THE BAY AREA ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. IS SHE BRINGS TOGETHER BLACK TEACHERS FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA TO DEEPEN OUR SKILLS AND TO THINK DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE CLASSROOM AND HOW WE CAN ELEVATE BLACK CHILDREN. FROM PRE K. TO CAN FOR A PRE K. TWELVE GRADE. AND HOW WE CAN. THE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENTGAP BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE CLASSROOM. ALSO THE WAY TO HELP RETAIN BLACK TEACHERS UNTIL THAT PROJECT I HAD NEVER SEEN MORE THAN THREE BLACK TEACHERS AT ONE TIME IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO WHEN TWENTY TEACHERS SO THAT THEY'RE ALL BLACK IT WAS LIKE WOW. WERE FAMILY. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING FUNDING. FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO BIG. RIGHT ALL TYPES OF GRANTS AND WE MAY GET A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF SO WE CAN'T PAY TEACHERS FOR THEIR TIME TO COME AFTER SCHOOL TO BE A PART OF THESE GROUPS. SO IF I COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING IT WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT KEEP. BLACK TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOMS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE OTHER THING IS I WOULD ASK THAT WE COULD. INCLUDE MORE BLACK MALE TEACHERS IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WE'RE NOT ALWAYS IN THE ROOM WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT US AND FOR US IN THE CLASSROOM SO GIVEN US MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE DECISIONS. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. IN THE OTHER THING WOULD BE. MENTOR SHIP. WE ARE WE HAVE THE BEGINNING TEACHER PROGRAM AND WE HAVE SO THE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC. TO BLACK TEACHERS. OR TEACHERS OF COLOR BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. WE HAVE DIFFERENT STRUGGLES AND WE NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN COME IN AND HELP US. NAVIGATE THOSE SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY FROM A PERSON OF COLOR AS POINT OF VIEW. SO THOSE WOULD BE THE THINGS I WOULD ASK. FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AND IT MIGHT. NOT JUST QUICKLY -- JUST MENTION IS MIKE MY COLLEAGUES REMINDED ME THAT AND IN PART AS MAY BE CONNECTING -- TEACHERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE WE WE WE WERE PUTTING MONEY IN THE BUDGET. FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR THINGS OF THIS NATURE. AND THEN I'LL GO BACK TO MY DISTRICT AND SOMEONE CARILLO SAY WILL GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICT AND ASK FOR THAT IN A ROW WHAT DID YOU APPLY. AND WE'LL FIND THE DUE DATE HAS PASSED. I MEAN IT DIRT THERE IS MONEY FOR FOR FOR EXAMPLE MY DISTRICT FOR CHURCHES. AND I'VE HAD. LATINO AND AFTER AMERICAN CHURCHES FIND OUT AFTER THE DUE DATE AND THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU KNOW FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- BE HUGE. TO SOME DISTRICTS TO TO START A PROGRAM AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED TO ALSO DO A BETTER JOB OF OF CONNECTING. YOU WITH WHAT THE RESOURCES THERE ARE A OUT THERE -- BECAUSE I I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES GOING ON THREE ACES PROGRAM. GOOD. FOR THE THE THINKING AS CHAIR AND AND TO THAT SAME POINT -- EVEN IN THE DEAD BUT THE DISTRICTS THAT DO APPLYING GET FUNDING ARE THE RIGHT ADMINISTRATORS IN THOSE DISTRICTS MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION ABOUT THAT MONEY. OR THEY JUST PUTTING INTO PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS PUT INTO. AND AND HOW MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY IS THERE FOR THAT MONEY BECAUSE CERTAINLY A LOT OF MONEY COMES DOWN -- WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS PROGRESS COMING UP AND AND HAS A REALLY GOING TO THE STUDENTS THAT NEED IT. AND AN ON THE SPOT BECAUSE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE YOU TAUGHT AT MY ALMA MATER OAK OF HIGH SCHOOL. ANY SIDE UNION. RETIRED FROM TEACHING BUT SHE'S -- STILL STILL TAKE PEOPLE TO SCHOOL. LED TO A BUT NO BUT I MEAN TO TO YOUR OPENING POINTS. OF THIS COMMITTEE I THINK MS WATKINS I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE AN EXAMPLE OF OF YOU. SAW THE STUDENTS YOU HEARD THE STUDENTS AND THEY DEFINITELY FELT LOVED AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. IS TO FEEL APPRECIATED AND AND WHEN I WOULD COME TO TO THE SCHOOL AND AND MEET THE STUDENTS -- IT DID YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT COMPETENCE IS THERE THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE SUCCESS -- BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MANY OF YOU TO GO AROUND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE INSTILL THAT. IN OTHER TEACHERS OTHER ADMINISTRATORS FOLKS ARE RUNNING ON PROSPECTS ARE GOING INTO OUR SCHOOLS BECAUSE BEING IN SILICON VALLEY WELL THERE'S A BUNCH OF MONEY. THAT COMES IN FROM FOUNDATIONS AND ALL THESE TECH COMPANIES TALKING ABOUT STEM FOR GIRLS AND STEM FOR MINORITIES ALL THAT MORE THIS MONEY COMING IN OVER MENTORING AND BUT ARE THEY REALLY LISTENING ARE THEY REALLY SEEING THE STUDENTS. OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING TO CHECK A BOX SAYING ALL WE CARE ABOUT STEM WE CARE ABOUT IN A MINORITY REPRESENTATION BECAUSE I TELL YOU THIS -- BEING IN SILICON VALLEY I'VE BEEN HEARING FOR DECADES FOR THIRTY YEARS ABOUT -- WE NEED MORE WOMEN WE NOR PEOPLE KALRA. TO APPLY FOR THESE I DON'T HAVE THE POOL OF APPLICANTS YOU THAT THIRTY YEARS TO CREATE A POOL OF APPLICANTS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THAT TIME. IN OTHER THAN WRITING A CHECK HERE AND THERE. BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE MAKING HIRING DECISIONS THERE'S ARE A LOT HIRING. LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE NOT HIRING WOMEN EVEN THOUGH -- THE DAY OF THE THE THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT THEY ARE THERE BEYOND THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT ARE APPLYING. ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT AND THAT'S WHERE THE WORK HERE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED -- YOU KNOW AS AS A SUMMER STONE WAS SAYING EARLIER TALK ABOUT LAWYERS AND LOCK REPRESENTATION. AT THE START OF THEIR KIDS. WE DON'T WAIT TO SOMEONE'S GOING TO UNDERGRAD SO HE WANT TO BE A LAWYER. YOU KNOW USED TO START INSTILLED WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THEIR YOUNGER THAT CONFIDENCE SAID THEN THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE CREATE. THE THE THE THE THE BELIEF AND AND I REMEMBER. ACTUALLY GOES BLACK KITCHEN CABINET MEETING WHERE IT WAS DISCUSSED THE ONE POINT FIVE GPA FROM SEVENTY NINE TO THE IT'S ONE POINT NINE MILLION THIRTY PLUS YEARS LATER. AND IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF YOU AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND AS A LACK OF SUPPORT. FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING -- EVEN WITH THE SUCCESS YOU HAVE IN THE MICROCOSM OF THE STUDENTS YOU CAN YOU YOU'VE SHOWN YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE PROVEN. THE MODEL. AND AND SO I THINK IT'S UP TO US DÃ¢N TO SCALE IT. RIGHT SPEAKING IN -- SO CANNELLA TERMS WE NEED TO SCALE THE MODEL BUT BUT AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOUR HERE -- AND THE OTHER IS THAT IT PRESENTED WHEN I WAS PRESENTING I MEAN SENATE COMMITTEE IS. THE BECAUSE THIS CONVERSATION AS I WAS SAYING MY OPENING COMMENTS THAT THE TIMING IS IS -- IS WHAT IS WELL OVERDUE BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S IT'S IT'S GOOD TIMING BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT. IF WITH THIS WITH THIS HEARING WAS HER TEN YEARS AGO WE WERE WE WERE STILL LOCKING PEOPLE UP WE WE WE WEREN'T EVEN. THE WE WENT IN THERE YET MAYBE SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHERE. BUT NOT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY NOT AS A STATE. I THINK NOW WITH WE HAVE THE RIGHT GOVERNOR IN PLACE WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS -- AND WE HAVE ACADEMIC LEADERS THAT ARE THAT ARE READY LIKE RARING TO GO AND SO I'M VERY I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST -- BUT SELECT COMMITTEEWERE HAVING ON THIS BUT IT WILL LEAD TO LEGISLATION THAT WILL LEAD TO BUDGET ASK BECAUSE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE SLACK COMMITTEES AND I KNOW -- CHAIR JONES SAWYER I'VE BEEN WHEN HE WAS SHARING -- THIS LACKEY ASSASSIN WISEMAN COLOR HE IS AS INTO THIS FOR SHOW THAT IT ENDS UP WITH RESULTS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN COMING INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS -- BUT IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF OTHER BUDGET REQUESTS ON THE CAN JUST COME FOR EXAM NINETY YEAH WHEN IT COMES A BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE PICKING UP. OF OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THE TOP AS WE TALK ABOUT WE AT THE TIME OF THE RECEIPTS. TO SHOW THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW AND SO THIS IS PART AGAIN THE RECEIPTS TOGETHER SO ON THE ASKS ARE MADE HEY WE'VE HAD THESE HEARINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS. THIS IS WHERE THIS MONEY CAN GO AND THESE ARE THE RESULTS CAN SHOW AND SO I AM I FEEL VERY HOPEFUL -- UP WITH TODAY'S HEARING AND THOSE THAT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- BUT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY -- WITH WHAT'S GONNA COME NEXT AND SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL TO BOTH YOU AND THE OTHERS ARE PRESENTED. AND I'M JUST VERY GRATEFUL TO BE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE NGUYEN SHONDA OF STARTED THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR MOVEMENTS YEARS AGO I WAS A PART OF THAT. SO I'VE BEEN ON THE GROUND I'VE BEEN I WAS THERE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR MOVEMENT BUT I NEVER SEPARATE BOYS FROM GIRLS. BECAUSE WHO ARE THE GIRLS GONE MARY RIGHT [inaudible] THEY I'M JUST SAYING. IF THEY IF THEY CHOOSE THE RIGHT WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO MARRY THE WRITING YOU TO HOLD ME IN. THE RIGHT SO -- BUT BUT I DO YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW AS A FAMILY MEMBER -- KALRA SAID WE CAN WE GO WAY BACK -- YOU KNOW HE'S TO COME TO A HIGH SCHOOL WHERE HE GRADUATED FROM IN IN IN THAT DISTRICT. AND EVERY YEAR HE WOULD YOU KNOW HE WOULD CREATE THE CERTIFICATE I'D ASK YOU CREATE THE CERTIFICATES FOR THESE BLACK KIDS WHO ARE YOU DON'T GET HIT BEING RECOGNIZED BY THEIR TEACHERS. AS EITHER IMPROVING OR WHATEVER WE SEE YOU KIDS WITH THE YOU AND HE WOULD NEVER HESITATE TO GET CERTIFICATES AND THEN IF TO THE SCHEDULE. HE WOULD COME SO THIS MAN HAS BEEN IN THE WORK A LONG TIME AND REYES YOU LIKE DOCTOR MARSHALL OVER THERE -- IN SO -- YOU KNOW% I AM I FORTY TWO YEARS OF THE WORK AS WELL -- BUT YOU GIVE THAT'S WHAT WITH A MAN EVERYTHING YOU WITH IT OVER THERE. I DON'T LIKE THE MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART IN THE IN THE BEING BECAUSE I WORK WITH STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION YOU KNOW I WITH I WAS LIKE JUST. HAVING A FIT THAT JUST COULDN'T GET IT YOU KNOW I WAS LIKE OH LORD YOU COULD SET UP TO THE EAST SIDE. HAD A JOB LIKE THAT RIGHT SO I'M JUST THEY AND I'M GLAD HE'S EMPLOYED NOW DOING A P. MATH AND SCIENCE BUT WE DO HAVE A STEM PROGRAM THAT IS READY FOR REPLICATION IT IS READY FOR SCALING IS TWENTY YEARS ALL. IN OUR RESULTS WE RAISE THE GAP GREAT DID YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME NUMBERS. SO THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAMS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ASUS WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND HAS LESS THAN. TWENTY YEARS IN A BEING IN AN OPERATION. CURRENTLY -- THERE WAS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET TO KEEP THESE PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY OFFICE WAS. ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION TO KEEP TO SCALE SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID AN INCREDIBLE THING WHICH IS INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR RIGHT WHICH IS A GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE. HOWEVER. THERE WAS A SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS IN GOVERNMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE RIPPLE EFFECTS TO THAT. SO THIS PROGRAM. WELL PAYING PEOPLE MORE. DID NOT A JUST FOR THE SALARY INCREASES WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO BE LET GO. AND SEE WHICH ULTIMATELY MEANT THAT LESS KIDS WERE GOING TO BE HELPED. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR MORE FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT THEY PLAY -- AND ENSURING THAT KIDS ARE SAFE THAT FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE AT SCHOOL. CHILD CARE IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND SO THESE PROGRAMS OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN TO SAY AT SCHOOL IN A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT CONTINUE. TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE AND MATHEMATICS AND STEM OPPORTUNITIES SO WE HAVE AN AN ADDITIONAL -- INCREASE IN THE BUDGET OF FIFTY MILLION THAT WE'RE HOPING THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNS AND THIS IS WHERE YOU ALL PLAY A ROLE. IN ENSURING THAT. IT ACTUALLY GET SIGNED UP BY THE GOVERNOR. A VERY SOON AS WELL AS THE ACOMPANYING BILL TO THAT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT US MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. WE CONTINUE TO PUT MORE MONEY TO ACTUALLY ACCOUNT -- FOR THOSE SALARY INCREASES ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A WAY IN WHICH WE WORK WITH THE BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS ARE TAKING CARE OF AS TO THE B. REALLY IMPORT HE'S. I'M SORRY THREE RECALLS. A FIFTH OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT HE SAID -- WHO'S GETTING THAT MANY THOUGH RIGHT I'M JUST SAYING WHO'S GETTING THAT MANY BECAUSE BOSTON PROGRAM IS NEVER GOT ANY THAT MANY WE RAISED OUR OWN MANY -- THROUGH GRANTS AND AND SO FORTH -- BUT YOU KNOW IF AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT MANY THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT. BUT THE VEIL OF ALL SO HOW DO GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT I LOVE THE BLACK TEACHER PROJECT HOW DID THEY LEARN ABOUT THIS KIND OF MONEY SO THAT THEY'RE NOT STRUGGLING HAVING YOU KNOW BIG SALES IN ORDER. TO DEVELOP THEIR DOORS AND WE'VE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE AND GET IN INFORMATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SO THAT MIGHT BE A PROJECT. WE NEED TO DO AMONGST OURSELVES TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT AND SO THAT WAS. THAT'S ONE OF MY TO DO LIST EXOTIC GET THAT OUT -- WE'RE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE LIKE RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS REALLY GREAT. TO MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF BUT I I HAVE PEOPLE THAT PROBABLY NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE. BUT ALSO. WHAT ARE A LOT OF PUBLIC COMMENT? COMING TO THE MIKE. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS GO I WANT. GOING TWICE THREE TIMES -- SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE THIS NOW. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION -- FOR ANYONE THAT'S LISTENING -- I'LL JUST SAY THIS ROSS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A MORE ROSE BUS ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT LATINOS IN IN IN IN EDUCATION IN DOING THAT. AND AND I I PUT IT THIS WAY MY DISTRICT -- I HAVE A A SCHOOLS PREDOMINATE LATINO WHERE THEY HAVE -- PEOPLE GOING TO YALE. AND TO STANFORD. WITH WITH TWO BLOCKS AWAY. GET ONE POINT [inaudible] NINE LATINO. WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY DOING OVER HERE WHAT IS THIS PRINCIPLE DOING OVER HERE? WAS IS LATINA DOING -- HERE. TO THIS SITE TEAM IS NOT DOING OR VICE VERSA. SO I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP. AND SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSION NEXT TIME. BECAUSE IT GOES TO WHAT THE SCHOOL BOARD YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT HOW THAT MONEY OF GET DISBURSED TO DANNY GOES TO PRINCIPLE DAY THEN MAKE A DECISION. AND WE ALL WE CAN DO IS JUST SEND THE MONEY THAT. ALL WE CAN DO IT JUST TO THE POLICY AND THEN SEND IT DOWN. WE GOT HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHO UTILIZING. THESE BONDS. TO THE FULLEST. BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER. YOUR PROGRAM IS IS FOR AFTER AMERICANS. I THINK THE SAME PRINCIPLES WILL WORK WELL. FOR TEEN ONLY. API NATIVE AMERICANS SAY IF IT DOESN'T IT'S ALL TRANSFERABLE THAT'S RIGHT AND AND SO -- HOW DO WE TRANSFER WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME HOW DO WE TRANSFERRED THIS? SUCCESS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS ARGUMENT BETWEEN CHARTER IN PUBLIC ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY BOTH ARE HAVING SUCCESSES BUT THEY'RE NOT PULLING ALL TO GET IT. IT IT DRIVES US CRAZY I WILL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW IT DRIVES. ALL OF US HERE AND NOT. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE ANSWER IS THERE. BUT IT'S NOT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT FLORES ARE TRAINED TRAINED ADMINISTRATOR OR SOMETHING. AND SO MAYBE WE THEIR NEXUS THE HAVE THAT CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND THEN JUST JUST BRINGING IN MORE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT. EVEN NATIVE AMERICANS. EXACTLY THERE IT DAM NUMBERS ARE. IF YOU THINK AFTER AMERICANS AND LATINOS ARE BAD. NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE STATE AND HOW WE TREAT THEM AS CRIMINAL CRIMINAL. INSTRUMENT SO IT WOULD. YES AND IS A THERE'S A COMMITTEE DOES LOOKING INTO THAT. AND SO -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE. THAT PARTICIPATED THAT. ADDICTIVE IS VERY EFFECTIVE -- LOOKS LIKE A CHECKBOOK IS ARE YOU START TO WRITE CHECKS ON IT I'M WORK ON THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW EVERYONE IT'S SPOKEN EVERYBODY THAT'S HERE. CONTINUE TO GIVE HIS INPUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO FOLLOW UP SO WE CAN MAKE THIS TANGIBLE CADETS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU THIS COMMITTEE STANDS ADJOURNED
