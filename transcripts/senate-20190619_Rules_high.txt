REST OF RESUME IN SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA I WAS LIKE TO FOCUS ON FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. ACTING LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THAT WAS ONE OF THE OFFICES YOU HELD -- WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ASK CAME IN OPEN QUESTION OF WHAT YOU SEE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BEING MOVING INTO THIS POSITION IN. ANY PERSONAL GOALS OR OBJECTIVES SHE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE PERSONAL BOARD JUST IN A FEW MONTHS THAT I'VE BEEN THERE WERE YOU KNOW WE I'VE SEEN SOME TRENDS IN SOME OF THE CASES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US. AN OF RESPECTFULLY I THINK THAT ALL OF UR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO REFRESH ON POLICY AND PROCEDURES BECAUSE WHEN YOU NOTICE THE SAME TYPES OF MISTAKES WHEN IT COMES. TO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS YOU KNOW IT IT IT JUST IT MEANS THAT YES WE NEED TO HEAR THESE CASES BUT WE ALSO WHAT I NEED AS A BOARD NEEDS SUPPORT. SB STAFF TO GO TO THESE DEPARTMENTS TALK TO THE DIRECTORS THE HR DIRECTORS BUT THE THE SECRETARIES AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE.

TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR RECRUITING RECRUITING SHOULDN'T BE JUST TAKING. THE TEST ONLINE IT SHOULD BE AS MANY DEPARTMENTS IN A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE DOING GOING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN. YOU KNOW BE AT NEXT GEN OF LEADERS AND STATE SERVICE. SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF COMMUNICATION WORK I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BUY IN FROM THE LEADERSHIP. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

SO IN THAT DOES REQUIRE CONSCIOUS. INTENTIONAL THAT REACH TO TO RECRUIT THAT NEXT GENERATION RIGHT AND AND AND AND INFORMATION TRANSFER RIGHT SO HOW DO YOU BRING ON PEOPLE NOW BEFORE THE THIS MASS EXODUS OF RETIREES. AND I THINK WE REALLY SHOULD CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK THE STAFF IS DOING A GREAT JOB ABOUT THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.

GOING THROUGH MY OFFICE OPENED UP A BOOK CASE SENATE AND IN THE BOOKCASE WAS A BINDER. ABOUT FOUR INCHES THICK I OPEN IT UP AND IT WAS A SET OF DECISIONS BY MARTY MORGANSTERN WHO SERVED ON THE POR PER BOARD IN NINETEEN IN THE EIGHTIES.

TO REPRESENTING FIREFIGHTERS -- IN YOU BRING A LOT OF FIELD EXPERIENCE SOME AND JUST BASIC CARING AND COMPASSION TO THE POSITION SO I CONGRATULATE YOU AND THANK YOU WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION -- JUST. IN LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE MOVING INTO ONE OF THE CONCERNS HAS BEEN CASE LOG -- BACKLOG OF CASES. WHICH YEAR PERCEPTION OF THAT CURRENT BACKLOG IN WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY -- THANK YOU AND AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A FRIEND OF MINE FROM EVERYBODY AND I I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS WHEN I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR PER BURNED AND KIND OF YELLING SCREAMING WHY ARE THEY MOVING CASES MORE -- SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY AWARE OF GOING IN THIS POSITION I APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OF GETTING GIVEN ON THE BUDGET -- THAT'S BEEN ABLE -- TO PROVIDERS MORE ATTORNEYS AT EVERY LEVEL MORE MORE BORDER VISORS -- I THINK -- THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE FIND ON THE CASELOAD IS IT'S JUST NOT NECESSARY THE NUMBERS BUT THE DYNAMICS OF THE NUMBERS SOME OF THE CASES ARE VERY EASY TO PROCESS THROUGH SOME OF THEM TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT IT'S GOING. TO TAKE SOME TIME TO DO IT AND SO EACH SIDE OF THE THE THE COIN WHETHER INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE O THE EMPLOYER OR THE UNIONS ITSELF. NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO GET A FAIR STRONG DELIVERED OF DECISION SOME OF THAT TAKES SOME TIME SO REALLY IT. IT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE NUMBERS IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST NUMBERS FOR PROBABLY MOVE CASES THROUGH THIS YEAR -- THE BACKLOG IN THE FORTIES BUT IT REALLY IS A QUESTION OF RESOURCES AND IN EVERY SORT ENOUGH RESOURCES SO WE CAN PROCESS THE CASES. I THINK ONE THING YOU ALSO SHARED IS. NOT ALL CASES REQUIRE SOME DEMAND A LOT MORE -- RESOURCES IN TIME IS THAT ACCURATE YEAH I I THINK AND THE EXAMPLE USE NOT TO GIVE ANY DETAILS AS WELL WELL I'VE BEEN PERSON WORKING ON A CASE -- SINCE MARCH -- AND WE'RE NOT CLOSE TO ANY FINAL DETERMINATION THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION ON BOTH SIDES. AND IN THE PROBABLY UP ON APPEAL SO YOU WANT TO GET THE RECORD CORRECT AN IN DEPTH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GO UP ON APPEAL AND BE TAKING A LOOK AT SO YOU KNOW WE COULD WE COULD COME TO A DECISION A LOT FASTER. BUT IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ANY PARTIES AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND I THINK ONE THING I FOUND IMPRESSIVE THAN YOU MIGHT SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEES. THE LOW PERCENTAGE OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN REVERSED ON APPEAL WHICH I THINK'S STRONGLY TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS OF PER. YEAH I THINK -- A IN A AGAIN IT DOESN'T NECESSARY COME TO THE LIGHT ABOUT THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN. APPEALED -- WE HAVE A 97% TRACK RECORD IN THE COURTS OF REALLY ESPECIALLY RECENTLY LOOKED AT AND SAY THAT WE ARE THE EXPERTS ON THE SUBJECT MATTER WHEN IT GETS UP ON APPEAL SO. IT JUST GOES BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THAT THE THE ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS AND ALL THE STAFF A PERVERT TAKE A JOB SERIOUS IN AND WANT TO DO IT. STRONG DELIVERS PROCESS BEFORE THEY MAKE A DECISION IT'LL THINKING AGAIN. CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO SERVICE PRECIADO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.
