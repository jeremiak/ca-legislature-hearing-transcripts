A TV SERIES THIRTEEN REASONS

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:44.642 region:rollup2
WHY.

00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:46.544 region:rollup2
SPEND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO

AS A LOCATION MANAGER AND SCOUT.

THE JOB HAS TWO DISTINCTLY

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:59.710 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.

00:42:57.475 --> 00:43:01.612 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS CREATIVE. COMPONENT

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.980 region:rollup2
IN THE SECOND OF LOGISTICAL.

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:04.749 region:rollup2
AND DURING THE CREATIVE PHASE

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.517 region:rollup2
OUR JOB IS TO FIND THE LOCATIONS

AN EVENT PLANNER. AND IF YOU

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.495 region:rollup2
WERE TO TREAT EACH LOCATION AS

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:19.597 region:rollup2
AN EVENT.

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:21.432 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.966 region:rollup2
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.534 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD FOR

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:24.769 region:rollup2
FILMING.

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:27.271 region:rollup2

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:34.045 region:rollup2
CREWS.

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:35.580 region:rollup2
HOWEVER MOST DECISIONS ABOUT

00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:36.814 region:rollup2
WHERE TO SHOOT ARE DRIVEN BY

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.850 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU CAN PRODUCE THE FILM

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:40.418 region:rollup2
AT THE LOWEST COST.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.918 region:rollup2
MATT'S MY OTHER STATES AND

00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:42.153 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES HAVE USED THE

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:43.120 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES.

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:45.490 region:rollup2
TO TAKE PRODUCTION AWAY FROM

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.058 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.726 region:rollup2
AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO WHO

CONSTANTLY WORKED OUTSIDE OF

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:54.398 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.800 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALL OF THE FILMS WERE

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:57.535 region:rollup2
BEING SHOT AND STATES AND

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.137 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES WITH SOME INCENTIVES.

00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:01.772 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW THE WORK

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.117 region:rollup2

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:15.520 region:rollup2
I WORKED IN A COMPLETELY

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:13.663 region:rollup2
WHETHER BECAUSE OF NETWORKS

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:15.599 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CLOSE TO THEM OR

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW PERCEPTION THAT AMERICAN

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
THE WORLD MAY NOT WANT TO SEE

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:20.437 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TYPES OF FILMS. ARE AND

CERTAIN TYPES OF STORIES IN THIS

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.340 region:rollup2
IS A THIS IS A VERY COMMON AND

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:25.008 region:rollup2
NO DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENING

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.575 region:rollup2
AND HAS BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.476 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS BUT MY HOPE IS

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.211 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:29.746 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO PATHWAYS WE CAN

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:30.914 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT OTHER WAYS OF OF

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.982 region:rollup2
EXPANDING ACCESS.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.750 region:rollup2

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.770 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION THAT THIS TAX CREDIT

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.038 region:rollup2

AND I LOOK AT THE.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.653 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY ISSUES ACTUALLY FROM

DIFFICULT TO SEE WAS.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.325 region:rollup2

COAST AND OR OR SOUTHEAST.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
SO.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.475 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:54.410 region:rollup2

THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:10.726 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:12.528 region:rollup2
THAT COMES BACK GOES INTO THE

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:15.164 region:rollup2

EDUCATION SO.

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:24.674 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT

GONNA BE THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:33.015 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES AFTER THE DUST

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.916 region:rollup2
SETTLES.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.751 region:rollup2
THERE ARE GONNA BE SEVERAL

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:37.687 region:rollup2

UNFORTUNATELY NOW ARE.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:43.993 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:45.761 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF INACTION.

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:47.964 region:rollup2

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:36.464 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S UNNECESSARY OVERLY

THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:14.235 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY IT FAILS TO

01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:07.014 region:rollup2
OFFICE REQUIRES THEM.

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.649 region:rollup2
TO CONSULT WITH AND TAKE INTO

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:13.087 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THE VIEWS AND CONCERNS

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:15.456 region:rollup2
OF THE TRIBES.

01:43:13.087 --> 01:43:18.125 region:rollup2
SO I ASK AGAIN. TAKEN TWENTY

01:43:15.456 --> 01:43:19.293 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT.

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:20.961 region:rollup2
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:21.862 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:23.397 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T TAKE

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:25.800 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT.

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:28.035 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.136 region:rollup2
WE ALL TO OFTEN.

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:30.438 region:rollup2
WHETHER IN THIS COMMITTEE OR THE

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:32.440 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES

01:43:30.438 --> 01:43:34.642 region:rollup2
SEE THE INSTITUTIONAL BIASES

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:36.143 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY. BECAUSE OF HOUSE

01:43:34.642 --> 01:43:38.379 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LAWS.

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:41.215 region:rollup2
ARE WRITTEN.

01:43:38.379 --> 01:43:43.217 region:rollup2
WHAT DID OF OUR HOMES SAY?

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:44.351 region:rollup2
?

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:46.454 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:48.456 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL BIAS EMBEDDED

01:43:46.454 --> 01:43:49.356 region:rollup2
