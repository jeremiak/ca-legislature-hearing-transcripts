THE UDA'S MERIT SO I MEAN THE

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.594
COMTE THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.063
MARRIAGE INCLUDES A LOT OF

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.731
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS AS I

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.833
THINK IS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.869
YOUR BILL -- SO WHY NOT JUST

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.504
HAVE PEOPLE.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.873
IS IT JUST THE WORD MARRIAGE OR

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.741
IS IT WHY HAVE THIS KIND OF TWO

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.243
DIFFERENT CLASSES.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.878
AND TO BEG THE QUESTION ALSO HAS

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.746
THAT IS IT SORT OF A SEPARATE

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:04.647
BUT EQUAL.

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:05.982
DISTINCTION IF WE CONTINUE TO

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.183
KEEP.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.284
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS AND

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.453
MARRIAGES AS IF THEY'RE KIND OF

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.721
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LEGALLY.

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.422
WELL I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.324
AND I THAT THE BALLOT TOPIC OF

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.592
DISCUSSION IT'S ONLY SEPARATE

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.494
BUT EQUAL IF PEOPLE ARE FORCED

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.029
INTO ONE OR THE OTHER BUT THIS

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.364
IS ABOUT TOWARDS.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.131
ON THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THAT

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.399
SHE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.568
OUTLINING THE VARIOUS.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.802
REASONS EITHER FINANCIAL OR

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.371
PHILOSOPHICAL THAT PEOPLE MIGHT

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.039
CHOOSE TO BE THE MASTER PARTNERS

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.774
INSTEAD OF MARRIAGE -- THERE ARE

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.075
SOME PEOPLE WHO THEY JUST DON'T

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.377
BELIEVE IN THE INSTITUTION OF

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.945
MARRIAGE BUT THEY DO WANT TO

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.380
HAVE BASIC PROTECTIONS -- IN

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.248

NEEDS -- THERE ALSO -- POTENTIAL --

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.792
TAX IMPLICATIONS OF GETTING

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:50.893
MARRIED AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.595
PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE OF COURSE THE

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:53.696
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.731
RECOGNIZE DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.466
VIEWS -- AS STILL BEING SINGLE

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:58.734
AND THERE MIGHT BE COUPLES OUT

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.336
BECAUSE OF A FEDERAL TAX ISSUES

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.505

MARRIED OR NOT MARRIED IN TERMS

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.147
OF SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS WHY --

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:14.350

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.361
THROUGH THE CHAIR SIR.

SO I THINK IT IS -- IMMIGRATION

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:54.229
VERY COMPLICATED IS VERY CASE BY

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:59.968
CASE -- UNFORTUNATELY -- IT YET

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.170
THERE'S A LOT OF BARRIERS

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:01.804
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY TYPE

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:02.838
OF REFORM SINCE EIGHTY SIX SO A

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:03.672
LOT OF FOLKS EVEN THOUGH THEY

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.674
MAY BE PRESENT HERE AND THEY

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:06.675
HAVE A WERE THE STORY.

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:07.309
UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS ON THE

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.777
BOOKS AND CASE LAW DOESN'T ALLOW

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.913
FOR THEM TO ADJUST THEIR STATUS

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.080
AT ANY POINT IN TIME -- AND AND

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:14.082
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY MIGHT

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.718
BE ABLE TO BUT EVEN THEN -- I

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:17.653
THINK A LOT OF THE FOLKS OVER

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:20.489
REPRESENT -- HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.957
RESOURCES TO TRY TO ADJUST THEIR

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:23.859
STATUS BUT UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:25.494
OF A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:28.130
BOB UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING AS A

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:30.132

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.201
RIGHT.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.836
THE MAGIC DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:36.839

YEAH OKAY GO AHEAD -- SO I'LL

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.179
TRY TO MAKE A REALLY LONG STORY

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.348
MEDIUM [inaudible]

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:49.985
I TRY.

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:51.086
IS IT IT'S BEEN ATTORNEY I MOVED

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.222
HERE WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I MOVED

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.923
TO MINNESOTA AS AN EXCHANGE

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.191
STUDENT.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.627
I LIVED WITH -- A LUTHERAN

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:01.730
FAMILY I CAME FROM.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.099
BEING AN ONLY CHILD MY MY DAD

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.934
PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:06.602
FIFTEEN AND AT THE SAME TIME I

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:10.272
WAS SUED BY HIS GIRLFRIEND'S FOR

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.640
HALF OF MY INHERITANCE.

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:14.443
SHE WAS THREATENING BOB AND SO

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.445
MY MOM.

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:17.813
DECIDED TO SEND ME.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.348
TO THE UNITED STATES SO I COULD

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.049
GET  DIFFERENT APPLAUSE MORE

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.051
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF FROM WHAT

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.121
I WAS HAVING -- I WENT TO HIGH

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.156
SCHOOL IN MINNESOTA WHERE A

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:29.925
LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE IS

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:32.227
THAT THE CITY OF NEW ON A ON TOP

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:35.931
I LATER WENT TO COLLEGE AND I

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:39.368
MATT MY EX HUSBAND.

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.435
WE WERE MATT WAS SO.

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:44.573
UP UNTIL I MET HIM I WAS LEGAL.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.343
AND I HAD TO TRANSFER MY STATUS

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.212
TO BE SPONSORED UNDER HIM.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.713
AND WE WERE TOGETHER FOR FIVE

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.950
YEARS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.485
TOO YOUNG AND WAS MEANT TO BE

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:56.785
[inaudible]

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:00.489
AND I NEVER I'VE NEVER GOT AN

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.124
INTERVIEW.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.159
SO TECHNICALLY MY CASE STILL

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:04.760
OPEN.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.729
ANY JUST FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.499
AND IT'S JUST AN IMMIGRATION

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.734
FLAW PROBABLY A CLIP CLERICAL

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.002
ERROR.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.971
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO I DON'T

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.273
QUALIFY FOR EINSTEIN VISA.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.509
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:23.412
AND YOU HAVE TO IT IT'S A VERY

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:26.315
TOUGH THERE'S NO EASY.

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:29.051
WAY FOR UP A PERSON.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.219
WHO IS STOP?

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:35.657
TAKING UNDER SOMEONE'S UMBRELLA.

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:37.960
TO HAVE TO FIX IT SO MY ONLY IN.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.494
MY ONLY SOLUTION FROM THIS POINT

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:43.932
FORWARD IS TO GET REMARRIED.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:47.803
BOB AND I I REFUSED TO DO IT.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.605
IN THE ILLEGAL WAY SO

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:50.906
[inaudible]

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:51.940
IT IS.

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.175
UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:57.579
WOULD CHANGE. TO FACILITATE IT'S

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.748
NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THERE NEEDS

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:02.217
TO BE SOME SORT OF REFORM IN

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.653
ORDER.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.053
TO I HAVE A FAIR.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.955
NONE.

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:10.092
NONE SOCIAL ECONOMICAL.

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:11.593
BASED SO THAT THAT EMBRACES

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.794
EVERYBODY'S SO ANYBODY COULD

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.130
HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE PROPER

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.333
STEPS TO GET THERE.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:18.867
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A A

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.168
PATHWAY.

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.136
I JUST WANNA ADD ONE QUICK THING

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.838
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED

LIVING IN CALIFORNIA FOR TEN

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:26.742
YEARS.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:29.711
SO THEY'RE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.014
THERE ALSO -- A MIX THAT IS

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.683

THIS IS A VERY INTEGRATED PART

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.399
OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:52.134

THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.950
OPPORTUNITY IN POSITIONS THAT

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.019

ON THIS ISSUE THOUGH IS IT

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.612
CITIZENSHIP DOES HAVE TO MEAN

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:13.448
SOMETHING OR OR DOESN'T MEAN

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:15.283
ANYTHING AT ALL RIGHT AND IN OUR

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:16.685
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS SET UP

IS THE FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.195
GOVERNMENT IS THE ABILITY TO

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:30.499
VOTE IS THE ABILITY TO RUN FOR

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:33.635
ELECTED OUT TO HOLD OFFICE.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.170
THE WHOLE GOVERNMENTAL OFFICE.

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.104
AND AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TO

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.239
MANY OF THESE CEREMONIES WHERE

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:38.140
PEOPLE BECOME.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:40.175
NEW CITIZENS AND IT'S AN AMAZING

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:43.011
THING AND IT'S A AND AND THESE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.079
PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:46.448
PROCESS OF NATURALIZATION.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.683
AND I AM THE FIRST TO AGREE TO

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.719
HAVE A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.487
WE DO AND AND AND M. WE NEED TO

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.122
FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.023
TO MAKE THIS.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.592
A SIMPLER PROCESS BUT MULTI

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.761
MILLION WANT PEOPLE.

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.930
TO COME IN TO CITIZENSHIP LEARN

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.365
ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT.

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:05.534
AN EX AND AND AT THE END THAT

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.768
THAT.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.336
THAT PLEDGE THAT HEY I'M

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.572
RENOWNED SCENE MY ALLEGIANCE TO

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.008
ANOTHER COUNTRY AND NOW I'M I'M.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.943
A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.144
OF AMERICA RIGHT IN [inaudible]

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:18.880
SO.

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.115
I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.650
HERE IS NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:22.984
PEOPLE TO SERVE NOT THAT WE

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.252
DON'T WANT YOU SERVING YOUR

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.922
COMMUNITY -- BUT THAT WE DO HAVE

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.323
TO RESPECT THE PROCESS OF

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.825
CITIZENSHIP -- AND THAT'S NOT

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.527
JUST ME SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:34.362
GOVERNOR BROWN SAID LAST YEAR

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:39.935
WHEN HE VETOED I THINK YOU CAN

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.269
HAVE BOTH OF THOSE POSITIONS AND

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:44.940
STILL VALUE THE SERVICE RIGHT --

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:45.974
AND SAY HEY HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.343
THAT -- YO.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.145
AND HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:52.280
OF CITIZENSHIP -- AND I AND I

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:53.615
THINK THAT'S WHERE I'M AT ON

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.684
THIS LEGISLATION [inaudible]

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:59.521
THE STRESS.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:00.689
I THINK THE QUESTION FROM MY

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.490
COLLEAGUE [inaudible]

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:09.364
EMPHASIZES THE THE LACK OF TRUE

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.099
UNDERSTANDING THE LACK OF TRUE

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:13.335
KNOWLEDGE.

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.836
OF HOW BROKEN.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:18.240
OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS --

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.441
WOULD LOVE EVERYBODY TO FOLLOW

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.010
EVERY RULE.

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.445
BUT IF THERE ARE NO RULES.

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:26.514
AND IF PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO DO

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:28.283
TO PARTICIPATE IN A GOVERNMENT

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.985
TO PARTICIPATE IN VOLUNTEERING

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.086
TO PARTICIPATE.

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:34.422
ARE THERE STILL SEEN AS SECOND

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:37.692
CLASS IS STILL SEEN AS FORCED TO

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:41.129
SIT. TO TO HIDE IN THE SHADOWS

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.964
WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:46.701
AND BUT IT BUT THE QUESTION IT

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:50.372
WAS IT WAS A A A WELL MEANT

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:52.140
QUESTION I AM CERTAIN.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.976
BUT IT ABSOLUTELY SHOWS THE LACK

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.311
OF KNOWLEDGE.

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.713
OF MOST PEOPLE OF HOPE BROKEN

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.782
HOPE BROKEN OUR IMMIGRATION

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.784
SYSTEM IS AND UNTIL WE REALLY

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:06.054
FIND A WAY TO FIX THIS SYSTEM --

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.323
WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE INTO THE

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:10.759
SHADOWS WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:16.898
TO BE LESS THAN WHO WHO THEY ARE --

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:17.432
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:20.869
COMMENT [inaudible]

01:22:20.935 --> 01:22:22.537
MR.

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:23.305
TO I WAS GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.106
ITEM BUT I WANTED TO RESPOND TO

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.508
THE SUGGESTION ACROSS THE AISLE

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.343
AND THE QUESTION OF WHY NOT

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.711
OBTAIN CITIZENSHIP AND SAY.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.746
I'M NOT CONTRIBUTE THIS TO TO TO

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.248
OUR COLLEAGUE BUT I THINK THERE

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.916
ARE MANY.

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:35.917
WHO ARE ACROSS THE AISLE WHO

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.786
ASKED THE QUESTION ONE IT YOU

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:38.853
BECOME A CITIZEN?

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.822
AND IT REALLY IS A PRETEXT TO

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:43.892
SAY -- THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.760
DON'T WANT TO BECOME A CITIZEN

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:47.996
OR YOU -- DON'T HAVE THE

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.130
QUALITIES TO BECOME A CITIZEN

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:49.998
NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.066
SAYING BUT THAT IS OFTEN HOW

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.300
THIS QUESTION.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.336
IS ASKED AND CURRENT POLITICAL

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.037
DISCOURSE AND I WOULD SUGGEST I

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.205
THINK IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.173
SAY OUR POLITICAL OUR

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:00.709
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS IS BROKEN.

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:01.543
IT IS BROKEN.

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.545
BUT OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:07.115
ALSO A POLITICAL CONSTRUCT IT IS.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.783
IT IS A SET OF POLICIES AND LAWS

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.051
THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE WITH THOSE

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:12.620
WHO CAN CONTROL POLICY.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.889
AND IT HAS BEEN SET UP IN THE

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.124
LAST COUPLE DECADES IN A WAY TO

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.225
NOT ALLOW.

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:19.761
IMMIGRANTS TO HAVE A REAL PATH

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.162
TO CITIZENSHIP EVEN.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:24.199
FOR MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS OF

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.767
HUMAN BEINGS.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.268
WHO WANT TO BECOME CITIZENS AS A

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:28.603
FORMER IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ATTORNEY

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.738
IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES I

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:30.839
CAN TELL YOU IN THE NINETEEN

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.006
NINETIES THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN?

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.041
IN THE LAST DECADE THE SYSTEM

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.043
WAS BROKEN IN THIS DECADE THE

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.811
SYSTEM IS IS BROKEN.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.780
AND AT THIS MOMENT WITH A

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.682
PRESIDENT WHO WAS DECLARED WAR

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.350
ON OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.119
IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:45.787
THROUGH HIS ADMINISTRATION. TO

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.390
KEEP INDIVIDUALS FROM BECOMING

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:51.259
CITIZENS -- THAT IS WHY.

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.460
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:53.895
OBTAINING CITIZENSHIP AND I JUST

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.730
WANNA SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.165
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I FIND IT

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.333
VERY IRONIC WE'RE HAVING THIS

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.868
DISCUSSION BECAUSE MANY OF THE

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.236
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS THAT

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.670
ARE CITED IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:03.605
ANALYSIS.

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:04.806
BY THE SAME SUPREME COURT

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.308
ANALYSES CASES THAT THIS

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.643

MARK.

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.481
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUGGESTED

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.450
THAT BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:15.950
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.252
QUESTION.

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.621
PLYLER VERSUS DEL ANOTHER UNITED

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.119
DARK TIME OF HISTORY.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:56.891
ASSAULT?

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.893
THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO BELIEVE

01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.761
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.629

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.080
THEIR ELOQUENCE IN TERMS OF

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.583
LINING AND DEFINING THE THE

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.284
CHALLENGES THAT WE ALL FACE WITH

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.053
A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:27.422
SO WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS OF

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.857
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.092
BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO BE DONE.

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.627
HOW TO ADVANCE THE THE BALL -- I

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:34.762

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.782
THE DEFINITION OF CITIZENSHIP

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.796
SERVICES THESE PEOPLE -- THESE.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:42.764
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HERE

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.465
DID THIS MORNING -- ARE DOING IN

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:45.967
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.268
BUT WE DO HAVE TO SAY THERE IS A

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.370
BODY OF LAW ABOUT CITIZENSHIP

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:51.406
AND THAT AND THAT DIESEL OFFICES

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:53.908
BOTH ELECTED AND APPOINTED.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.677
ARE TO BE FILLED BY PEOPLE WHO

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:58.146
ARE CITIZENS AND EVERYBODY OF

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.781
LAW IS POLITICAL AS A POLITICAL

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:00.982
CONSTRUCT.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.183
AT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.318
MAKING THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.519
MORNING I DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.753
SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO FILE THE

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.222
FILE FALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.591
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN THE

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:11.159
STATE WHICH ARE POLITICAL

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.560
CONSTRUCT AND THE PEOPLE JUST

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:15.830
IGNORED THEM THAT WOULD BE OKAY --

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.632
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY OF LAW IS A

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.634
POLITICAL CONSTRUCT THAT WE HAVE

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.169
TO GO THROUGH AND I WOULD ALSO

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.403
SAY TO THOSE.

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.439
CITIZENS WHO HAVE SWORN IN WHO

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.074
LIVE SPOKE AT THE CITIZENS WERE

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.342
IN CEREMONIES.

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.943
THEY WENT THROUGH THAT ARDUOUS

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.346
PROCESS THAT THAT TOUGH PROCESS

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:32.513
THAT IS.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.915
I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE NOT

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:37.185
WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:37.752
BUT THEY WENT THROUGH IT AND

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:39.721
THEY YOU KNOW BECAME CITIZENS.

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:40.955
AND I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:42.323
OF A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THEM TO

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.292
SAY WELL YOU WANT TO THAT

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.660
PROCESS IN.

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:47.328
THE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.329
DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:51.666
PROCESS IT'S UNFAIR IT WOULD BE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.369
UNFAIR PROCESS TO DO THAT --

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.670
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY AGAIN.

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:57.205
FROM THE GREAT SERVICE THAT

01:27:57.271 --> 01:27:58.806
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS CAN

01:27:58.873 --> 01:27:59.807
STILL PROVIDE TO THEIR

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.776
COMMUNITIES AND DO COULD PROVIDE

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.645
TO THEIR COMMUNITIES -- AND I

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.480
THINK AGAIN YOU CAN LIVE IN BOTH

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:06.714
OF THOSE WORLDS.

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.549
AND SAY LOOK THIS THIS IS THE

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.118
LAW AND WE DO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:12.553
LAW WHETHER WE I'M SURE ALL OF

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.222
US TO GO AROUND AND AND POINT

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.523
OUT LAWS THAT WE DON'T LIKE.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:17.425
THAT WE DON'T DO WE DON'T THINK

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:19.527
SHOULD BE THE CASE BUT THERE LAW.

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:23.698
NONE THE LESS [inaudible]

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:28.069
A STRESS.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.804
THERE IS NO PROCESS.

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:31.039
THE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THERE

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.473
IS NO PROCESS WE HAVE DHAKA

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.075
STUDENTS.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.711
WHO HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THE THE

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.579
THE VALUE THAT THEY ARE TO ALL

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:39.714

THERE IS NO PROCESS ANOTHER.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.563
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.597
MENTION ALSO IS THAT.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.432
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS DUAL

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.367
CITIZENSHIP WITH MANY PEOPLE.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:01.569

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:38.933
REALLY THE MISAPPLICATION.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.201
OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.403
CITIZENSHIP ULTIMATELY MEANS AND

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:44.005

THROUGH ALL OF OUR EDUCATION

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.647
MEANS MORE THAN JUST WHETHER

THAT HAPPENS.

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.531

IS.

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:16.470
YOUR WELL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:17.971
WOULD THINK IF IT'S AT AS A GAY

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:20.474
COUPLE A MERRY GAY COUPLE.

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:22.176
IN FAMILY LAW OFTEN ONE OF THE

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:24.211
FACTORS IS IF YOU HAVE A TWO

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:24.711
PARENT HOUSEHOLD IT'S A

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.847
PREFERENCE -- I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:28.215
SURE THAT THAT THAT THERE'S

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:30.017
NOTHING THAT WOULD -- PREVENT

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:31.218
EVEN IF THAT TWO PARENT

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:34.521
HOUSEHOLD IS EIGHTY MALE FEMALE.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.423
PARENT COMPARED TO EIGHT LGBT

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.592
KILL OTHER PARENT BUT I THINK

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:39.860
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE YES I THINK

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:40.794
THE WITH THAT THAT THE BILL IS

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:41.495
WRITTEN.

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:43.330
IS THE FOCUS IS A WHAT'S IN THE

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.199
BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD WHICH

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:46.967
IS WHAT THE INPUT THE IMPORTANT

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:50.270
PIECE IS AND SO THE PREFERENCE

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:51.505
FOR A STABLE HOUSEHOLD.

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:52.639
YES AS YOU MIGHT HAVE A SINGLE

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:54.675
PARENT ANY MORE STABLE HOUSEHOLD

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.810
RATHER THAN A TWO PARENT FAMILY

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:59.179
BUT IF A TWO PARENT FAMILY IS IN

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.614
THE BEST INTEREST YES AND WITH

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:01.682
THIS BILL WOULD SAY IS.

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:04.251
IS IF THAT'S A SAME SEX COUPLE

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:05.385
OR OR NOT.

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:07.921

SOME PRISONERS SO LONG AS IT'S

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:29.943

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:30.711
A DETRIMENT TO THE CHILD?

WHEN A JUDICIAL OFFICER AND BY

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:26.333

WHAT IF SOMEBODY WALKS IN AND

THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:50.290
APPROPRIATE GOAL INAPPROPRIATE

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:52.225

WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT HERE IS

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.841
NOT LABELING IT INAPPROPRIATE ME

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:11.345

TIME SENATOR STEINBERG --

01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:12.799
THOUGHT LEGISLATION WAS CRAFTED

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:14.567
BASED ON INPUT OF SURVIVORS OF

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:17.504
HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT VICTIMS

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:18.671

LOT OF HESITATION IN CONTACTING

GOVERNMENT OR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:25.478
HOTLINE.

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:26.913
SURVIVORS WE WORKED WITH

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.448
INDICATED THAT THEY BELIEVE THE

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.950
HOTLY POSTERS AND PUBLIC PLACES

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.619
WOULD HELP VICTIMS ACCESS THE

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:34.754
SEEK THE HELP.

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:36.623
AND THE US ELEVEN NINETY THREE

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:38.158
WAS BORN REQUIRING SPECIFIC

BUSINESSES TO POST NOTICES IN

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:42.195
PUBLIC PLACES WITH INFORMATION

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:44.597
TO NGO OPERATE AT HOTLINES.

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:46.166
SINCE THAT LEGISLATION WENT INTO

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:47.801
A FACT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:48.802
HAVE WORKED WITH LOCAL CITIES

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.637

SENATOR NOTED UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.075

VISITS BY THE VOLUNTEERS.

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:08.288
SO IN LIGHT OF THAT LACK OF

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:09.622
COMPLIANCE THE NEXT STEP WOULD

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.558
BE FOR CITY OR COUNTY TO SEEK

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:12.992
ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROVISIONS.

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:15.762

THIS BILL ADDRESSES A RECURRING

01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:57.183
PROBLEM.

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.518
THE PROBLEM EXISTS BECAUSE OF AN

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:00.520
UNINTENDED LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:01.688
LAW.

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:03.489
AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ENACTED

01:56:03.556 --> 01:56:04.924
IN TWENTY TWELVE LIMITED MOST

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:08.261
DEPOSITIONS TO SEVEN HOURS.

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:09.562
THE SAME IS IN FEDERAL MATTERS.

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:11.597

01:56:13.166 --> 01:56:14.233

BUT AFTER DISCUSSIONS AND

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:17.704
HEARINGS THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:19.739
THE BILL TO INCLUDE VERY SIX

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:22.141

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.876
EXCEPTIONS FOR EXPERT AND OTHER

SPECIALIZED WITNESSES FOR ALL

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:28.114
EMPLOYMENT CASES AND FOR COMPLEX

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:29.382
CASES.

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:32.618
HOWEVER IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT.

01:56:32.685 --> 01:56:35.221
TO EXEMPT DYING PATIENTS FROM

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:36.689
THE SEVEN HOUR LIMIT.

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:38.324

DAYS OF CROSS EXAMINATION.

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:42.328
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.931
HAPPENING IT'S NOT HUMANE.

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:46.532
DESPITE CURRENT LAW.

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.267
DEPOSITIONS OF END STAGE

01:56:48.334 --> 01:56:50.903

01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:53.573
MORE.

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:55.875
OF QUESTIONING BY DEFENDANTS.

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:57.243
THIS IS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.778
INCLUDES A LOOPHOLE.

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:00.446
A LOOPHOLE WHICH ALLOWS ONE SIZE

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:03.015
FITS ALL CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERS

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.484
TO OVERRIDE EVERYTHING IN THE

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:05.485
LAW.

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:06.753
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:09.389
PLAINTIFF IS CLOSE TO DYING.

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:11.324
I UNDERSTAND THAT SEVEN HOURS OF

01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:12.925
ON THE RECORD INTERROGATION OF A

01:57:12.992 --> 01:57:13.893

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.495
MESOTHELIOMA PATIENT OR

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:18.231
SILICOSIS PATIENT IS STRESSFUL

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:19.532
BECAUSE IT GENERALLY TAKES A

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:22.835
FULL TWO OR THREE DAYS OF TIME.

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:24.404
SEVEN HOURS OF DEPOSITION.

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:26.406
TAKES TWO OR THREE DAYS TO

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:27.440
COMPLETE.

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.475
YOU HEAR SEVEN HOURS YOU THINK

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:30.777

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.151
SENATE BILL SIX FORTY FIVE

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:40.086

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:56.502
AS LONG AS THE HEALTH OF THE

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:57.870
DEPONENT DOES NOT APPEAR

01:57:57.937 --> 01:58:00.406
ENDANGERED BY THE GRANT OF

HE WAS DEPOSED FOR TWELVE DAYS.

01:58:13.553 --> 01:58:14.921
HIS ATTORNEYS TRIED TO USE

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:15.988
EXISTING LAW TO LIMIT THE

01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:17.156
INTERROGATION.

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:18.691
BUT THE COURT APPLIED ITS CASE

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.460
MANAGEMENT ORDER IN WOULD NOT

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:23.296

IS MICHELLE REPORT.

01:58:25.698 --> 01:58:26.833
THE TWELVE DAY DEPOSITION.

01:58:26.899 --> 01:58:29.302
WAS EXTREMELY DEBILITATING AND

01:58:29.368 --> 01:58:31.771
WAS CONCLUDED ON HIS DEATH BED

01:58:31.838 --> 01:58:33.806
IN THEIR OWN HOME.

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:35.708

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.683
WHO REPRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:46.419
OF WORKERS EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:47.987

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:50.490

01:58:50.556 --> 01:58:51.724
FIVE IT'S A NARROW BILL.

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.793
IT WILL GREATLY HELP VICTIMS OF

THE DAY OF THESE TO SPECIFIC

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:57.363
DISEASES ONLY.

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:58.731
BECAUSE THESE DISEASES ARE

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:01.601
EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL AT THE

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:02.969
END OF LIFE.

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:04.303
IT WILL SURE THESE VICTIMS ARE

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.972
TREATED HUMANELY IN THE CIVIL

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:07.139
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:08.508
DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF THEIR

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:10.042
LIVES.

01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:11.544
AND JUST BEFORE I CLOSE.

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:14.347
SOME OF RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:16.015
COMPROMISED OFFERS.

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.850
BY THE OPPONENTS YOU'LL HEAR

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:19.952
FROM THEM.

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:23.122
LAST YEAR -- THEY OPPOSED A BILL

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:25.224
THAT HAD AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:26.926
HOURS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.561
MULTIPLE DAYS.

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:32.131
AND NOW THEY PROPOSE THAT AS A

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:34.367
POSSIBLE COMPROMISE WHAT YOU

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:36.335
NEED TO KNOW MEMBERS.

01:59:36.402 --> 01:59:38.371
IN THESE CASES.

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:41.974
IF THE PLAINTIFF DIES BEFORE THE

01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:43.442
CASE IS CONCLUDED.

01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:45.578
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:48.414
FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING DAMAGES.

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.049
ONLY MEDICAL DAMAGES.

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:51.484
SO YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM WITH A

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.885
BUILT IN.

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:55.688
INCENTIVE TO DRAG OUT THE

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:58.190
DISCOVERY PROCESS TO DRAG OUT

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.825
THE DEPOSITION PROCESS.

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.761
BECAUSE IT LIMITS WHAT THE

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:03.796
DEFENDANTS HAVE TO PAY OUT IF

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:06.132
THEY CAN RUN OUT THE CLOCK.

02:00:06.198 --> 02:00:09.168
IN THE PLAINTIFF DIES THANK YOU.

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:11.337

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.772
IT'S A BILL TEN FLAW IN THE

02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:15.474
SYSTEM WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:17.743
A LIMITED UNIVERSE.

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:19.512
THESE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:22.014
CASES EACH YEAR IN THE STATE OF

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:23.349
CALIFORNIA.

02:00:23.416 --> 02:00:24.684
I KNOW MORE THAN A HUNDRED CASES

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.218

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:27.853
AGAIN THE DEFINITION IN THIS

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:28.721
BILL.

02:00:28.788 --> 02:00:31.157
A DOCTOR HAS TO CONCLUDE AND

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:34.060
THE COURT.

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.595
THAT THE PATIENT THE PLAINTIFF

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.296
HAS LESS.

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:39.732
THEN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.534
AND FINALLY I HAVE IN FRONT OF

PLAINTIFFS HAVE TO RESPOND TO

02:00:48.507 --> 02:00:50.209

THERE'S NOTHING THAT THESE

02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:03.335
VICTIMS CAN SAY IN THOSE

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:05.170

EXTREMISTS POSITION THAT THESE

PLAINTIFFS ARE IN I HAD A GOOD

02:11:48.533 --> 02:11:50.936
FRIEND DIED OF MESOTHELIOMA AND

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.504
IT WAS A HORRIBLE WAY TO GO.

THAT HAPPEN TO BE IDIOPATHIC

02:11:54.072 --> 02:11:56.241
THEY COULD NOT TRACE IT TO ANY.

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:59.211
EXPOSURE TO ANYTHING BUT MOST ME

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:01.113
SO CASES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:03.148
THIS PAST US AND WE UNDERSTAND

02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:04.583
IT.

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:05.917
AT THE SAME TIME.

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:08.353
DEFENDANTS DON'T DECIDE HOW MANY

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.423
DEFENDANTS ARE NAMED IN A CASE.

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:13.025

CASES TO INVOLVE DOZENS AND

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:21.133
DOZENS OF DEFENDANTS.

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:22.634
BECAUSE THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.569
AVENUES OF EXPOSURE YOU COULD

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:25.937
HAVE WORKED ON A SHIP.

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:26.838
THEN YOU COULD HAVE WORKED ON

YOUR OWN BREAKS AND DEALT WITH

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:31.410

THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO BE

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:40.218
EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS AND LOTS OF

02:12:40.285 --> 02:12:41.553
DEFENDANTS ARE NAMED.

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:44.022
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:45.023
SUBSTITUTES WHAT HAS BEEN

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:48.393
DESCRIBED AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.262
CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER WHERE

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:52.998
JUDGES WHO DO THIS EVERY DAY

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:54.766
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAVE

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.402
UNIFORMLY SAID WE'RE GONNA START

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.905
WITH THE DEFAULT OF TWENTY HOURS.

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:02.307
IT CAN BE REDUCED OR INCREASED

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:04.209
AT THE MOTION OF THE PARTIES AND

02:13:04.276 --> 02:13:08.313
WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE IT.

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.348
TO SEVEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:10.749
A SPELL SPELLS LAWYER AND I'M

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:14.186
NOT. TO INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:15.554
THAT DEPOSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.322
DIFFERENT IF THERE'S FIFTY

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:20.158
DEFENDANTS THAN IF THERE'S FIVE

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:22.227
THE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE ASKED

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:24.496
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A MOTION TO

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:26.164

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:27.332
JUDGMENT.

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:29.568
AND WE BELIEVE THAT AT SEVEN

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:31.703
HOURS YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL DUE

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:34.806
PROCESS VIOLATION FOR DEFENDANTS.

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.742
BECAUSE THEY MAY WELL NOT GET

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:38.343
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:40.746
QUESTIONS THEY NEED TO ASK. TO

02:13:40.812 --> 02:13:42.481
SUPPORT THEIR MOTION FOR SUMMARY

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:44.683
JUDGMENT BY THE TIME THESE GET

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:47.085
TO TRIAL THERE ARE USUALLY NOT

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:48.820
FIFTY DEFENDANTS THERE ARE THREE

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:51.690
OR FOUR BECAUSE THIS PROCESS HAS

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:53.091
WEEDED OUT PEOPLE.

02:13:53.158 --> 02:13:55.460
WHO DON'T BELONG IN THAT CASE?

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:59.898
WE HAVE MADE COMPROMISED OFFERS.

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:02.501
WHAT THE WITNESS AND?%

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:03.969
LORD I FEEL SORRY FOR HER

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:05.871
EXPERIENCE WITH HER FATHER.

02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:08.273
BUT SHE ASKED FOR FOURTEEN THAT

IT BE LIMITED TO FOURTEEN HOURS

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:11.977
AND IRONICALLY THAT IS THE

02:14:12.043 --> 02:14:14.045
COMPROMISE OFFER THAT WE MADE TO

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:17.883
GO TO WOULD DEFAULT PROVISION OF

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:19.217
FOURTEEN WE BELIEVE.

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:20.385
THAT THIS THING COULD BE

02:14:20.452 --> 02:14:24.523
COMPROMISED AND A HUMANE RULE

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.925
ESTABLISHED THAT DOES TAKE INTO

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:28.660
ACCOUNT THE SHEER NUMBER OF

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:31.163
DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES.

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:34.466
SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.067

KINDS OF CASES THE PLAINTIFFS

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:07.492
THEMSELVES OF FOR THE MOST PART

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:08.994
THEY'RE NOT THE SCIENTISTS --

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:09.761
AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:10.629
RECOLLECTION PRICE PUT OUT SOME

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:11.296
RECOLLECTION OF WHERE THEY WORK.

02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:15.367
THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:16.835
CRITICAL AYE AYE THE MAGIC OF

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:18.637
THESE KINDS OF CASES AS WELL AS

02:16:18.703 --> 02:16:22.040
THE SCIENTIFIC -- OVER A BASIS

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:23.475
WHERE THE EXPERT TESTIMONY ON

02:16:23.542 --> 02:16:24.743
BOTH SIDES WOULD COME IN AND I

02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:27.078
EXPERT WITNESSES I KNOW PLAY A

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:27.913
CRITICAL ROLE IN THESE TYPES OF

02:16:27.979 --> 02:16:31.016
CASES.

02:16:31.082 --> 02:16:33.318
BUT IT THE I GUESS THE QUESTION

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:34.786
OR THE COMMENT SLASH QUESTION IS

02:16:34.853 --> 02:16:37.088
WHEN I WHEN I WOULD CAN GARNER

02:16:37.155 --> 02:16:38.456
SOMEONE'S WORK HISTORY OF ME

02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:39.991
WOULD USUALLY TAKE ME.

02:16:40.058 --> 02:16:41.493
A MINUTE TWO MINUTES.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.128
MAYBE FOR FIVE MINUTES WELL IT

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:44.095
WAS A CRITICAL.

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:45.797
ASPECT OF THE CASE.

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:48.833
AND I WOULD GET A BUSINESS

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:50.702
RECORDS INDICATING WHERE TEY

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:53.038
WORKED IT WAS US TRULY CRITICAL

02:16:53.104 --> 02:16:54.172
ASPECT OF THE CASE PARTICULARLY

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:55.407
BUT HAVE TO DO WITH TIME

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:57.309
LOCATION REGARDING A PARTICULAR

02:16:57.375 --> 02:16:58.410
ABOVE.

02:16:58.476 --> 02:17:00.245
SUBURB OF TIME OF AN INCIDENT

02:17:00.312 --> 02:17:02.380
AGAIN I UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:04.149
DIFFERENT INCOME OVER TO CIVIL

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:05.283
AND I KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:06.351
TALKING ABOUT.

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:08.954
SOMEONE IN A OF A DECADES OF

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:09.854
HISTORY WHETHER IT'S WORK

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.389
HISTORY OR AS THE OPPOSITION TO

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:13.892
CASE MAYBE THINGS AT HOME THAT

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:14.893
THEY MADE WORKED ON WHAT HAVE

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:21.833
YOU -- BUT IT BUT I GUESS --

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:22.934
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:24.035
OPPORTUNITIES IN EVIDENCE CODE

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:26.371
TO GET SOME OF THE KEY.

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:29.107
INFORMATION NECESSARY -- THAT A

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:32.677
PLAINTIFF BUT PERSONALLY HAVE --

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:35.113
AS OPPOSED TO WHERE YOU CAN GET

02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.648
WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM.

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:37.749
RECORDS.

02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:39.985
AND SO I I I I GUESS THE

02:17:40.051 --> 02:17:42.120
QUESTION IS WHAT IS WHAT IS

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:43.622
TAKING ANOTHER NUMBER DEFENDANTS.

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:45.123
BUT I'VE BEEN IN MULTIPLE

02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:47.325
DEFENDANT CASES WHERE A JUDGE

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:49.628
WILL.

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:50.829
LIMIT THE MATH TEST.

02:17:50.895 --> 02:17:52.397
AT THE SAME THING THAT'S ALREADY

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:53.598
BEEN BOUGHT OUT BY TWO OR THREE

02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:54.032
DEPENDENTS.

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:56.701
SO I I GUESS WHAT IS TAKING SO

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:57.836
MUCH TIME.

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:58.970
SO THAT I COULD -- I GUESS

02:17:59.037 --> 02:18:00.438
THAT'S THE QUESTION TO GET TO A

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:02.273
WHAT IS TAKING SO MUCH TIME WHY

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.975
SO MUCH TIME NECESSARY AND I'M

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:05.543
HAPPY TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES

02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:06.978
AND IN THAT REGARD.

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:08.279
WELL LET ME LEAD OFF.

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:10.315
OTHERS MAY WANT TO COMMENT ON

02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:11.816
THAT AS WELL.

02:18:11.883 --> 02:18:13.218
BUT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:17.255
THIS I THINK.

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:18.056
WITHIN YOUR QUESTION.

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.324
THE ADVANCE DISCOVERY PRIOR TO

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.992
THE DEPOSITIONS BEING TAKEN.

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:22.961
IS VOLUMES OF INTERROGATORIES

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:24.095
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE MORE

02:18:24.162 --> 02:18:27.165
ACCURATE RECORD WHEN A PLAINTIFF

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:28.700
HAS TO RECONSTRUCT.

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.068
THE STREET ADDRESS OF THE

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:33.805
BUILDING HERE SHE WAS WORKING AT

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.607
FOR TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS --

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:36.875
WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR DEATH BED

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.276
IN YOU ASKED THE QUESTION THAT'S

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.177
ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED AN

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:41.212
INTERROGATORY THE GOAL OF THAT

02:18:41.279 --> 02:18:43.715
QUESTION IN THE DEPOSITION IS TO

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:45.183
TRIP IT'S TO TRY TO GET THE

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:48.086
PLAINTIFF TO MAKE A MISTAKE?

02:18:48.153 --> 02:18:49.621
IN THE STREET ADDRESS.

02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:52.323
WHERE THE BUILDING LOCATION WAS

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.425
THAT BUILDING LOCATION?

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:56.361
IS THAT THE ONE YOU WORKED AT IN

02:18:56.428 --> 02:18:57.896
TWO THOUSAND SIX OR WAS THAT THE

02:18:57.962 --> 02:18:59.297
ONE YOU WORKED OUT IN.

02:18:59.364 --> 02:19:00.732
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN COM.

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:02.333
WITH THE ISSUE OF MULTIPLE

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:03.735
DEFENDANTS.

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:04.803
THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.771
DEFENDANTS FROM COLLABORATING

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:07.739
AND COOPERATING THEY'RE

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:09.574
DEFENDING THEIR OWN INTEREST

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:11.142
OBVIOUSLY IN THEIR OWN CLIENT.

02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:12.711
BUT THEY CAN ALSO WORK TOGETHER

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:15.313
TO PRIORITIZE -- AREAS OF

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.182
QUESTIONING IN IN DEPOSITION

02:19:17.248 --> 02:19:19.350
THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. TO ALL OF

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:20.885
THEM ARE A GROUP OF THEM.

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.520
NOTHING PREVENTS THAT

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:25.223
COORDINATION IN BEING EFFICIENT

02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:25.724
IN DEPOSITIONS.

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:28.893
BUT THE GROUND THAT'S BEING

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.528
COVERED IN TRYING.

02:19:30.595 --> 02:19:32.497
WE HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:34.866
RIGHT NOW THAT ARE BROKEN THAT

02:19:34.933 --> 02:19:38.203

MISS BROUGHT MYERS FATHER ANA AN

02:19:40.538 --> 02:19:43.508
ABSOLUTE ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS I

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:45.577
BELIEVE TO TAKE SOMEBODY IN

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:47.145
THEIR FINAL DAYS OF LIFE.

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:49.748
AND AS WAS STATED BY HER FATHER

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:52.016
HIS GOAL WAS TO SURVIVE THE

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:55.720
DEPOSITION. TO PROTECT HIS

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:58.923
FAMILY IN HIS HONOR -- THERE'S

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:01.526
NOTHING SET MEMBERS SEVEN HOURS

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:04.996
TRANSLATES TO TWO OR THREE DAYS

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:07.098
OF CONVENING A DEPOSITION.

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.701
THE BILL BEFORE YOU.

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:11.102
GRANT SEVEN HOURS.

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:13.338
IT ALLOWS A JUDGE TO EXTEND IT

02:20:13.404 --> 02:20:14.739
BY THREE HOURS WHICH COULD BE

02:20:14.806 --> 02:20:17.142
ANOTHER DAY OR MAYBE TWO DAYS

02:20:17.208 --> 02:20:18.610
EVEN DEPENDING.

02:20:18.676 --> 02:20:22.514
ON HOW WEAK THE DEPONENT IS --

02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:24.149
WE BELIEVE IT PROTECTS DUE

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:30.855
DESIGNED TO PROTECT.

THE DUE PROCESS.

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.826
IN HUMAN DIGNITY.

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:38.062

I DO KNOW WHAT MY DEFENSE

02:20:58.149 --> 02:21:00.819
LAWYERS SAY ABOUT THE UTILITY OF

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:03.688
INTERROGATORIES AND THEY TELL ME.

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.723
THAT THE INTERROGATIVE RESPONSE

02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:07.659
TO INTERROGATORIES THEY GET IS

02:21:07.725 --> 02:21:08.960
NOT HELPFUL.

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:11.296
IN MANY CASES THAT THEY ARE MERE

02:21:11.362 --> 02:21:12.864
RECITATIONS OF WHAT WAS IN THE

COULD BE QUESTIONS OF DAMAGES

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:30.882
BUT THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION.

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:32.884

PICKING UP ON THE LAST QUESTION

02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:03.348
WE WERE REALLY TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:22:03.414 --> 02:22:05.116
YOU YOU SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:07.018
NEGOTIATIONS IRAQ I'M CLEAR ON

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:08.052
WHAT THE BILL IS SAYING IN TERMS

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:10.989
OF THE TIME FRAME JUST REMIND ME

02:22:11.055 --> 02:22:11.756
WHAT IS.

02:22:11.823 --> 02:22:13.925
THE PLACE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:16.895
LANDING IN TERMS OF WHAT IS YOUR

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.196
VIEW OF THE COMPROMISE BECAUSE

02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:18.730
I'M RIGHT.

02:22:18.796 --> 02:22:19.931
I'M SURE IT'S BEEN SAID BUT IT'S

02:22:19.998 --> 02:22:21.132
NOT CLEAR TO ME NOW AND LET ME

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:22.333
JUST ALSO SAY.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.135
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:25.503
INDIVIDUALS WHO.

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.372
IS IT THAT'S NOT DISPUTED THAT

02:22:27.438 --> 02:22:30.608
THEY HAVE -- THIS ELEMENT RIGHT

02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:34.112
AND THEY WORKED AROUND.

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:35.079
A PRODUCT THAT.

02:22:35.146 --> 02:22:37.248
MORE THAN LIKELY WAS THE BECAUSE

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:37.815
HE SAID THAT THEY COULD HAVE

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:39.217
BEEN.

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:40.785
J. WORKING IN THE GARAGE OR

02:22:40.852 --> 02:22:41.386
DOING SOME OTHER THINGS BUT I

02:22:41.452 --> 02:22:44.589
THINK THAT -- THERE'S A LARGER

02:22:44.656 --> 02:22:46.257
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

02:22:46.324 --> 02:22:47.959
THE THE NATURE OF THEIR JOB OR

02:22:48.026 --> 02:22:49.160
WHAT THEY WERE WORKING AROUND AS

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:51.229
BEST AS WAS MORE THAN LIKELY THE

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:52.297
COSTS OF NOW.

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:54.165
THE LAWSUITS BEEN FILED WE'RE

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:56.267
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE

02:22:56.334 --> 02:23:00.204
AUTHOR HAS A AND THE WITNESS

02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:01.873
HAVE MADE WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER

02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:03.574
PRETTY COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:05.910
THAT -- THE THE PROCESS OF

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:07.612
GETTING.

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:09.180
TO THE GRANULARITY OF THE ISSUE

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:11.416
IS KIND OF RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK

02:23:11.482 --> 02:23:12.784
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE AT THE END

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:14.052
OF LIFE.

02:23:14.118 --> 02:23:15.954
AND SO.

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:18.856
WE'RE DOWN TO A PLACE WHERE --

02:23:18.923 --> 02:23:20.792
THE BILL SAYS SEVEN HOURS.

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.360
WHICH TRANSLATES INTO.

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:25.063
A NUMBER OF DAYS -- THE JUDGE

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:26.698
HAS THE RIGHT TO EXTEND IT. FOR

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:29.000
A PERIOD OF TIME AND WHAT IS IT

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:30.768
THAT YOU'RE SEEING IS.

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:32.670
NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THAT -- AS

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:34.505
BEEN DESCRIBED TO FOR EVERYONE

02:23:34.572 --> 02:23:39.978
TO GET TO THE PLACE OF THE TRUTH.

02:23:40.044 --> 02:23:42.113
THROUGH THE CHAIR.

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.348
OF THIS ROLE IN THANKS -- THE

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.316
OFFER THAT WE MADE TWO YEARS AGO

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:48.052
WAS A DEFAULT OF FOURTEEN HOURS

02:23:48.119 --> 02:23:51.923
INSTEAD OF TWENTY WHICH WAS THE

02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:53.491
AMOUNT THAT APPARENTLY OF THE

02:23:53.558 --> 02:23:56.828
LAWYERS IN THIS CASE ASK -- FOR

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:58.062
WITH THE ABILITY OF THE

02:23:58.129 --> 02:24:01.165
PLAINTIFF TO MOVE FOR LESS TIME

02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:03.568
AND THE DEFENSE TO MOVE FOR MORE.

02:24:03.634 --> 02:24:05.370
A WE WERE TOLD THAT THE CONCERN

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:07.271
WAS TE REIMPOSITION OF THE CASE

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:08.639
MANAGEMENT ORDER WHICH WOULD

02:24:08.706 --> 02:24:12.710
RENDER THE BILL OR LAW MOOT --

02:24:12.777 --> 02:24:14.645
SO WE SAID NO -- YOU COULDN'T

02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:16.114
USE A CASE MANAGEMENT ORDERED A

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.281
VERY IT HE WOULD HAVE TO

02:24:17.348 --> 02:24:20.952
INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATE EACH CASE --

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:22.453
THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERN THAT

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.889
THE INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION IS NOT

02:24:24.956 --> 02:24:27.158
OCCURRING AND WE WOULD DO WHAT

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:28.159
WE COULD IN THE BILL.

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:29.827
TO REQUIRE THAT.

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:32.130
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:34.132
COMPROMISE OF COURSE THAT'S NOT

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.700
MY CALL THAT'S YOURS.

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:38.936
BUT I THOUGHT A REDUCTION FROM

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:40.071
TWENTY TO FOURTEEN WAS A VERY

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:42.173
SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION AND THAT

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.408
WOULD BE THE DEFAULT.

02:24:43.474 --> 02:24:44.842
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED YOU COULD

02:24:44.909 --> 02:24:46.444
HAVE SOME SORT OF SLIDING SCALE

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:47.545
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:50.048
DEFENDANTS AGAIN WE DON'T CHOOSE

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:53.751
WE MAY BE DEFENDED.

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:55.386
SIXTY TWO AND SO MAYBE YOU HAVE

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:56.788
SOME MINIMUM AMOUNT PER

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:57.789
DEFENDANT.

02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:59.757
WE ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT ALL

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:02.460
OF THOSE THINGS -- BEFORE GIVEN

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:03.694
THE CHANCE.

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:04.996
AND IF I MIGHT THROUGH THE CHAIR

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:07.765
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION AS WELL.

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.834

THROUGH THE CHAIR.

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.959
IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD CONSIDER

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:37.962
REMOVING ANA WOULD PAY PAIN AND

02:25:38.029 --> 02:25:40.098

DEFENDANTS TO HAVE THAT

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:04.101
OPPORTUNITY. TO TO BECAUSE EACH

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:07.038
THEIR OWN CLIENT.

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:08.439
THEY WANT TO GET THEIR CLIENT

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:10.007
OUT OF THAT LAWSUIT.

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.442
AND IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF DUE

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:13.411
PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:15.379
WHOEVER DOESN'T BELONG TO THE

02:29:15.446 --> 02:29:17.982
LAWSUIT GETS TAKEN OUT -- AND

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.116
THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:29:19.183 --> 02:29:21.218
DONE IS TO DISCOVERY WEATHER'S

INTERROGATORIES OR DEPOSITIONS --

02:29:24.155 --> 02:29:27.024
THE COMMENT MADE IN THE ANALYSIS

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:27.892
WAS.

02:29:27.958 --> 02:29:30.861
THAT AS THE BILL ADVANCES THAT

02:29:30.928 --> 02:29:32.596

OPPONENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:37.368
THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND.

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:37.968
THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:41.672
THAT I WOULD -- SUGGEST -- AS

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:45.076
NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- BUT

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:47.011
THERE SHOULD BE.

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:50.147
THERE THERE SHOULD BE A PERIOD.

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:51.882
AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE THERE

02:29:51.949 --> 02:29:57.988
SHOULD BE A A A DETERMINATE --

02:29:58.055 --> 02:29:59.724
NUMBER OF HOURS THE SHOULD BE

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:01.992
USED FOR FOR DISCOVERY

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:05.296
ESPECIALLY WHEN A PERSON IS.

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:07.798
AT THE END BUT I WOULD ASK THAT

02:30:07.865 --> 02:30:09.533
AS NOTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:10.334

THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONTINUE

02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:13.804

OPPOSITION? FOR SEVEN PLUS.

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:27.451

IF HE HAS.

02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:48.672
AS I THINK IT'S IT'S THE

02:30:48.739 --> 02:30:50.141
STRONGEST ARGUMENT.

02:30:50.207 --> 02:30:53.177
OF DEFENDANTS COUNSEL IS SOMEHOW

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:56.447
BEING DENIED DUE PROCESS -- BUT

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:57.548
FOR SOME OF THE REASONS YOU

02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.316
CITED AND FOR REASONS CITED

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:00.918
EARLIER.

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.787
THE CASE MANAGEMENT IN THESE

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.989
CASES INVOLVES YOU DON'T HAVE TO

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:06.424
FIGHT TO GET CERTAIN RECORDS

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:08.025
BECAUSE IT'S MANDATED.

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:10.161

MEDICAL RECORDS THEY'RE ALL

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:12.563
EXCHANGED READ AT THE BEGINNING

02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:13.697
OF THE CASE.

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:14.999
SO IS INTERROGATORIES ARE

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:16.734
DEVELOPED THEY CAN DRAW FROM

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:18.469
THAT PRELIMINARY EXCHANGE OF

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.271

02:31:20.337 --> 02:31:21.338
TO GET MEDICAL RECORDS YOU'RE

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:22.673
NOT FIGHTING TO GET EMPLOYMENT

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:23.607
RECORDS.

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:25.743
INTERROGATORIES FURTHER REFINE

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:27.912
ON THAT EARLY INFORMATION

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.647
EXCHANGE.

02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:31.515
THE PURPOSE OF DEPOSITION IS TO

02:31:31.582 --> 02:31:34.752
MAYBE CLARIFY WHAT IS NOT FULLY

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:37.855
ANSWERED IN AN INTERROGATORY OR

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:39.190
WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY --

02:31:39.256 --> 02:31:41.459
BUT WHAT WE SEE IN THESE CASES

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:45.196
IS AN INCENTIVE. TO ASK EVERY

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:46.730
QUESTION IT'S LISTED IN AN

02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:48.666

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:50.901
PURPOSE OF RUNNING OUT THE TIME

02:31:50.968 --> 02:31:52.436
RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK.

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:55.506
THERE'S A BUILT IN INCENTIVE TO

PROTRACTED THE DEPOSITIONS.

02:31:58.843 --> 02:32:00.144
IT'S A FAULT IN THE LAW I

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:01.812
BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:03.614
LIMITED UNIVERSE OF TERMINALLY

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:06.283
ILL DYING PATIENTS FOR WHOM WERE

02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:08.219
TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE.

02:32:08.285 --> 02:32:09.553
THAT I BELIEVE PROTECTS THE DUE

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:12.189
PROCESS RIGHTS OF NOT ONLY THE

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:13.724

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.793
BUT ALSO OF THE PLAINTIFF TO

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:18.229

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:20.097
IN THE DUE PROCESS IN THAT

02:32:20.164 --> 02:32:21.232
LAWSUIT.

02:32:21.298 --> 02:32:23.200
WELL HAVING THE HUMAN DIGNITY

02:32:23.267 --> 02:32:25.503
AND RESPECT NOT TO HAVE TO BE

QUESTIONED.

02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:30.541
IN THEIR DYING HOURS

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:30.841

THEM.
