WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY THE FIRST ITEM IS LIBRARY SUPPORT. AND R. THREE WITNESSES ARE JASON CONSTANT TOURISTS FOR TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GREG LUCAS THE STATE LIBRARIAN AND JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIANNA BROWN'S FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL ALSO JUST BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS WITH THAT ARE RECOGNIZED TO SPEAKERS JASON GREG AND JENNIFER IN THAT ORDER. AND ARE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE MR CONSTANT TOUR. ALL RIGHT JASON CONTRERAS HELLO. ON THIS ITEM AS NOTED FOCUSES ON STATE SUPPORT FOR LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH LOCAL FUNDING COMPRISING ABOUT 95% OF LOCAL LIBRARY OPERATING BUDGETS OTHER REMAINING 5% IS SHARED BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES AND A FEW OTHER SOURCES. NOW THIS ITEM FOR YOU CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN. THE FIRST IS FUNDING FOR LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE SECOND IS FUNDING FOR LIBRARY OPERATIONS AND SERVICES SO I WILL TOUCH ON EACH COMPONENT AND IN BOTH CASES PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF- BACKGROUND AS WELL. FIRST AND THEN ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN PROVIDES- ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ACCORDING TO STAFF ON INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IT WOULD BE PROBABLY TO FIND IT SO IT WOULD INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAY WOULD INCLUDE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WOULD INCLUDE PROJECTS TO EXPAND- INTERNET ACCESS IN BROADBAND CAPACITY OF INCLUDE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES THINGS OF THAT NATURE FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES. OUR STAFF IS ALSO KNOWN TO US THAT SPECIFIC FUND SOURCE OF THE WONDER DOLLARS IS STILL BEING- FIVE TEN FINALIZE IT'LL BE FINALIZED AFTER ME REVISION. BUT THAT THE FUND A FUNDING MIGHT BE A MIX OF- STATE GENERAL FUND AND- SOME FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS. AND JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT HERE THE STATE HAS IN PREVIOUS YEARS PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL THE MOST NOTABLE SOURCES INCLUDE- TO VOTER APPROVED BONDS ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN ONE AND IN TWO THOUSAND SO THESE ARE- OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND THEN IN MORE RECENT YEARS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE STATE HAS BEEN PROVIDING SOME ONGOING FUNDING- TO IMPROVE THE LIBRARIES ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. AND THEN ON THE SECOND COMPONENT FOR- DIRECT LABOR SUPPORT. I'M HERE THIS COMPONENT STATUS NOTED IT THAT THE FINAL- I'M NOT A FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED LIBRARIES IS STILL BEING DETERMINED THEY'LL BE FINALIZED AFTER THE REVISION. OF WHAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO LOCAL LIBRARIES DIRECTLY AND SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL OPERATIONS. AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THESE FUNDS LIBRARIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE- THEIR EXISTING POLICIES ENACTED. FINES AND FEES ON PATRONS WHO- RETURN THEIR LIBRARY MATERIALS AND BOOKS LATE. I CAN HEAR FOR CONTEXT HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SUPPORT TO LOCAL LIBRARIES THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THERE ARE DESCRIBED ON PAGE FOUR FIVE YEAR AGENDA. ALL THE FIRST PROGRAM IS THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY SERVICES ACT THAT PROGRAM FOCUSES. ON RESOURCE SHARING SO IT SUPPORTS ACTIVITIES LIKE INTERLIBRARY LOANS AND ACQUISITION OF WHAT TRONIC RESOURCES. ON THE SECOND. OF PROGRAM. IS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOUNDATION ACT. OF WHICH PROVIDE A MORE DIRECT SUPPORT FOR LIBRARY OPERATIONS- IS YOUR JANET NOTES BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE DEFUNDED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION TO HELP ADDRESS THE STATE'S BUDGET SITUATION. SINCE THAT TIME THE STATE HAS RISEN FUNDING FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY SERVICES ACT- BUT IS NOT REGION FUNDING FOR THE FOUNDATION PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER LUCAS WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU- GREG LUCAS FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY- I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE- SENTENCE BUDGET PLAN. I THINK BY FROM ANY OBJECTIVE MEASURE- THERE'S A LOT OF THE ONGOING BENEFIT OF ONE TIME MONEY IS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY INVESTING AND- THE SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO GROW RESPONSIBLY AND SUCCEED ECONOMICALLY. SO- BUT WITH THAT SAID- GOOD GOOD LIBRARIES HAVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS INSTEAD OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS- I JUST THINKING BACK ON WHAT JASON SAID- AT THE REQUEST OF THE RESEARCH BEAR WENT OUT IN APRIL AND DID A SURVEY OF LIBRARIES AND IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE GOT AN ESTIMATE FOR THE RENOVATION- RECONSTRUCTION- REHABILITATION NEEDS OF ABOUT IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION IF MY MEMORY SERVES- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO FIGURE IF YOU ADD THE OTHER ELSE THAT'S MISSING 30% LET'S SAY YOU KNOW THE TOTAL NEED IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS STRUCK ME IN THE SURVEY RESULTS AND- A NEED IS SOME KIND OF SUMMARY TOUCHES ON THIS. IS THAT FUNCTIONALLY A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF LIBRARIES ARE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. AND BUT THAT DOESN'T. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WERE BUILT TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT MEANS THEY WERE BUILT YOU KNOW SOMETIME AGO AND HAVE BEEN REMODELED SUBSEQUENTLY SO THAT FROM A QUOTA BOTH FUNCTIONAL STANDPOINT THERE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE. BUT EVEN IF THERE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE- BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES THAT- THE OLDER BUILDINGS TACK RIGHT SO MANY WERE GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT IF YOU BRING A I'M TOLD IF YOU BRING UP BATHROOM UP TO COMPLIANCE- THAT CAN COST. AT LEAST ONE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE- OLDER BUILDINGS AREN'T AS ENERGY EFFICIENT HAS MORE MODERN BUILT. AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO. IMPROVING BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY AND CONNECTING CALIFORNIANS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED RIGHT TRYING TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP- AN ENORMOUS ISSUE IS THE WIRING IN THESE OLDER BUILDINGS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE KIND OF HI SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY THAT'S REQUIRED- IN OUR INCREASINGLY DIGITAL AGE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL GLAMOROUS BUT TO MAKE THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING IN THE AREA OF BROADBAND- YOU HAVE TO HAVE BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES THAT ARE BRINGING IN THE HIGHER SPEED AS OPPOSED TO OLDER BUILDINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKE THE FINAL. AND AGAIN LIKE THE EIGHT LIKE THE BATHROOMS UNDER ABA IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CHEAP SO WE JUST USED GRANT MONEY- TO HELP THE BANNING LIBRARY BANNING BEAUMONT IT'S ON INTERSTATE TEN AS YOU'RE GOING OUT. TO THE PALM SPRINGS- TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT BUILDING SINGLE STORY SO IT'S NOT A TERRIBLY COMPLICATED PROJECT. BUT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO THE REQUIRE. AND SO IF YOU IF YOU ASSUME HALF OF THE STATE'S ELEVEN HUNDRED LIBRARIES. REQUIRED BETTER WIRING TO ACCOMMODATE HIGHER SPEED BROADBAND. WELL THAT'S AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SIX HUNDRED LIBRARIES BUT SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN AND OF ITSELF. SO I CAN I DON'T TO TAKE MORE TIME I COULDN'T SPEAK TO THE OTHER- FUNDING ISSUES IF YOU'D SENATOR. OVER THE OTHER SENATORS ON THE PANEL HAVE QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW HIM AND HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO BUT- THAT'S GREAT. AND THEN WILL MOVE TO JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AT GENERALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I AM AN AVAILABLE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS ON THE STATE LIBRARY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMPREHENSIVE FOR A PRESENTATION. I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH THANKS FOR BEING HERE LET ME ASK OF THE STATE LIBRARIAN- A QUESTION OR TWO BUT FIRST. LET ME JUST SAY THAT- I THINK THAT THESE ITEMS ARE SO SELF EXPLANATORY WORTHY OF SUPPORT I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HEARING THEM TODAY I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS ON THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US BUT ON TWO OTHER ITEMS FOR THE STATE LIBRARIANS- ONE IS AS YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW OUT DATED SOME OF THE LIBRARY BUILDINGS ARE. OF THE STATUTE THAT SORT OF SETS FORTH THE DUTIES OF THE STATE LIBRARY AND ALSO SEEMS TO ME TO BE A LITTLE OUTDATED DO YOU THINK OVER TIME MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING US SOME UPDATES TO THAT. WELL WHAT THE SHORT IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES THE MAIN CALIFORNIA'S OPERATING UNDER A LIBRARY SERVICES ACT THAT WAS WRITTEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO MANY OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY WHATEVER THAT IS FORTY THREE YEARS LATER- ARE REALLY COVERED IN THAT LEGISLATION I MEAN WE RECENTLY- AMENDED INTO YOU KNOW ADD A DIGITAL COMPONENT TO IT BUT- AND SO JASON WAS REFERRING TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOUNDATION ACT. I MEAN THAT'S- FUNDING FORMULA THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND EIGHTY TWO. I THINK I THINK. I MEAN JUST TO SORT OF. YOUR BILL ON ON WHAT YOU WERE SAYING SENATOR I MEAN WHAT WHAT WE MAY HAVE AND I WOULD SAY YEAH DON'T JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I MEAN A LOT OF THINGS BESIDES THE COLOR OF MY HAIR CHANGED OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS. AND MAYBE THE PRIORITIES AND THAT WERE ADDRESSED IN LEGISLATION FROM THAT PERIOD ARE HAVE EITHER BANNED ADDRESSED OR AREN'T AS HIGH A PRIORITY AS OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR- SEE TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU EN M. S. YOUR QUESTION WAS THAT YOU KNOW YOU DID AND I THINK YOU SET UP MY PROMISE WHICH IS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU OVER THE IF NOTHING ELSE IN THE FALL TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF THERE'S THINGS WORTH DOING ALTHOUGH. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO START TALKING ABOUT THE COLOR OF PEOPLE'S HAIR AND- AND WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY FROM THE SEVENTIES SO- JUST FOR THE RECORD- AND THEN. THE OTHER QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHICH IS NOT A CHEN DIES TO BUT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE A REQUEST ON. AND MIGHT LOOK AT IS. IS THE LIBRARY ADMINISTERED. I DID MY TO. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A LIBRARY MAYBE IT WAS THE ARCHIVES ADMINISTERED GRANTS FOR ARCHIVES TO THE LGBT ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WAS THAT YOU WERE WAS THAT THE OR CARDS- THAT WAS THAT WAS THE STATE LIBRARY IT WAS- MEMBERS- I REQUEST BY THE- THE LEGISLATURE. AND THERE I'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THAT IS TWO YEARS AGO I WON YES AND THERE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IT WAS ALL SPENT AND THERE'S AN INCREASED DEMAND AND THERE'S A REQUEST FOR A MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR SO. IF WE IF THAT SHOWS UP IN THE MAY REVISE SORTS ADDED YOU WOULD BE PREPARED TO ADMINISTER THOSE GRANTS AGAIN RIGHT. BUT YES WAY WE DID IT BEFORE WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT AGAIN I MEAN THERE'S LIKE. I WOULD. NOT TO- DIMINISH THEIR REQUEST OR THEIR NEED. BUT THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF OTHER ARCHIVAL GROUPS IN MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL SOCIETIES THAT. HAVE SIMILAR SIMILAR NEEDS SO I AM REALLY AWARE IF THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT PROWSE THROUGH OUR CARDS SO TO BE HAPPY TO. NO I WILL WANT TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR RESPONSE. NUMBER ALMOST ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS SIDE SENATOR MAN OR TROUBLED. SECRETIVE THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAY ROACH BOGO AND SENT MEANT. WHERE THAT OKAY THEN I'LL GO THE SENATOR MEN. HI I WANTED TO ASK- A BIT ABOUT- THE FEE RELIEF AND ITS GOALS I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS AS EQUITY AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I WONDER IF WE'RE CREATING A SITUATION WHERE- YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN WE YOU KNOW KNEW THAT IF WE RETURN OUR BOOKS LATE WE- ENCOURAGE THOSE FEES AND THAT WAS A DETERRENT TO ME RETURN THOSE BOOKS LATE AS A KID. AS AN ADULT- AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR LOCAL LIBRARIES KEPT POPULAR BOOKS IN STOCK MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT A WEEK BUT I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS OR THREE MONTHS FOR. THE LATEST COOL BOOK THAT WE ALL WANTED TO CHECK OUT AND I WONDER IF PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE CATERING TO LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES IF THIS MIGHT HAVE A PERVERSE RESULT OF- ACTUALLY CREATING MORE BOOK ANSWERS- JUST BY. KIND OF GETTING RID OF ANY. INCENTIVES TO ACTUALLY. THOSE BOOKS ON TIME. IN I GUESS A BIG MIKE MY QUESTION IS COULD WE DO THIS MORE TAILORED. IF THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TARGETED RELIEF COULD WE JUST TARGET. A CERTAIN HOUSEHOLDS AND COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RELIEF. RATHER THAN A BLANKET POLICY THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT QUESTIONS FOR BUT- PROBABLY ANY OF THEM. I GUESS THIS IS A MORAL HAZARD QUESTION AT THE END OF THE DAY IT LOOKS LIKE MR LUCAS'S PREPARED TO PLUNGE INTO THE MORAL HAZARD TERRITORY. I SEE. I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT I AM- WELL I THINK CERTAINLY THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PROPOSAL COULD BE MORE NARROWLY TAILORED THE EXPERIENCE HAS NOT BEEN- WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SENATOR I MEAN IT'S BANNED. IT'S BEEN THERE THERE BEEN A GREATER NUMBER OF RETURNS OF ITEMS AND HIGHER LIBRARY USE BY ABANDONING THE FEES AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I IT IS ONE OF THEM WAS THE SAME THING IN MY YOUTH RIGHT LIKE THAT WAS AN INCENTIVE. THE YOU KNOW TO HONOR THE BARGAIN THAT I'VE MADE WITH THE LIBRARY THE TO RETURN THE MATERIALS ON TIME JUST LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SAYING. THAT THIS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE THAT IS THAT- THE PEOPLE ARE MORE RESPONSIVE WITHOUT THE FEES. YEAH IT WAS VERY IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME. WE WE'VE GOT A- A NEWER EMPLOYEE AT THE LIBRARY WHO CAME FROM COLORADO SO THEY DID A LOT OF WORK IN COLORADO ABANDONED- THE FEES AND FOUND OUT THAT INSTEAD OF- YOU KNOW HAVING MORE BOOKS NOT RETURNED MORE BOOKS WERE RETURNED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THERE'S OTHER ISSUES TO NOW WITH- WITH THE PANDEMIC- WHERE- IT'S THE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE EFFORT THAT GOES INTO GETTING THIS MONEY BACK CAN OFTEN BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN. THE MONEY THAT'S AT ISSUE- HAS A TERRIFIC REPORT. I NEED TO REFERENCE THAT IN THE IN THE RIGHT UP FROM. THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM BUT TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND- THE IN EQUITY ISSUES YOU DESCRIBE SENATOR AS WELL AS SORT OF THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF REDUCING THE FEATS. BUT I YOU KNOW IN. YEAH IN THE AGGREGATE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH- TAILORING SOMETHING. YOU KNOW MORE MORE NARROWLY RIGHT- AND I AM ALSO NOT AT A 100% SURE WHETHER. THERE OUGHT TO BE A BLANKET PROHIBITION AGAINST. I MEAN DOES THAT CONSTITUTE A STATE MANDATE THAT RIGHT THE RESULTS IN THE ABILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SAYING WELL HEY YOU'RE IMPOSE THIS ON US YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING GO TO COVERAGE. YOU KNOW WE'RE TAKING IN THE- WHATEVER IT'S CALLED STATE MANDATE COURT. HI I SUSPECT THE DOUGH AND STATE MANDATE QUARTER NOT TERMS THAT FINANCE WOULD USE IN THEIR PRESENTATION YEAH I JUST THREE HUNDRED MEN BUT A QUICK FOLLOW UP I MEAN IT'S SO WITH THIS WAS AND IT WAS JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC LIBRARY OR SURVEYS THERE IS THERE ARE MORE DATA WHAT WHAT WAS THE- AND I GUESS I COULD JUST LOOK UP THE REPORT AT SOME POINT BUT IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE SIR WHAT'S- WHAT'S A SAMPLE SIZE HERE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE I'M HAPPY YEAH I'M HAPPY TO I MEAN THERE'S A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. THERE'S A NUMBER OF MEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WANT TO SAY THE LA. CITY LIBRARY SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO THE COUNTY- A LOT OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN RID OF FEES- ONE PRIMARILY YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE EQUITY ISSUES- BUT TO BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT INVOLVED IN TRYING TO- GET BACK TO THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. IS IN. A MAJOR PORTION OF THEIR OPERATING BUDGETS AND IT ALWAYS AS YOU'RE SUGGESTING SENATOR I MEAN FOR A SMALL OR LIBRARY JURISDICTION RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO LA CITY WHICH HAS BEEN A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET- YOU KNOW THOSE SORT OF REVENUE STREAMS LOOK DIFFERENT. YES BY THE LIBRARIES THE LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE FEES LARGE AND SMALL HAS LARGELY BEEN AN INCREASE IN USAGE AND A RETURN OF. OF MATERIALS THAT PREVIOUSLY HADN'T COME BACK TO THE LIBRARY MISTER LUCAS I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU CAN PROVIDE. THE INFORMATION ON A LINK OR REPORT TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THE OTHERS IF RELEVANT TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND SHE COULD PROVIDE IT TO THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THAT OF SENATOR MENDED THAT COMPLETE YOUR QUESTION I DID I HAD ONE OTHER QUICK FOLLOW UP- I GUESS I WAS JUST WONDERING IS THIS. PARTICULAR BUDGET ALLOCATION I'M NOT FOR THAT LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I PARTICULARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD- YOU KNOW YOU GUYS KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO BUT BUT WONDER WHAT IS A LIBRARIAN FUTURE LOOK LIKE- YOU KNOW I AM SURE THAT SOMETHING YOU ALL THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT BUT WHAT. ONE OF THE DEBATE WHETHER THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY AND- YOU KNOW IF WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING BACK BETTER WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR LIBRARIES AND DO WE HAVE- IS THIS SOMETHING. THAT YOU FEEL LIKE SATISFIES YOUR NEEDS. THE IS CRAIG LUCAS- WELL THAT'S A TERRIFIC QUESTION I MEAN- THE LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE- I MEAN WE'RE SEEING THAT TAKING PLACE IN COMMUNITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA NOW SO LIBRARIES HAVE BECOME IT IT MEAN WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITY CENTERS KIND OF WHAT COMMUNITY CENTERS WISH THEY COULD. SO INCREASINGLY LIBRARIES NOW ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE SPACE INSIDE OF THEM MORE FLEXIBLE. LIBRARIES THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LIBRARY DIRECTORS IN THE LIBRARY USERS IS CAN WE HAVE MORE PRIVATE STUDY ROOMS FOR COLLABORATION RIGHT SO THE LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE IS A PLACE THAT THE SILICATES. SKILL SETS IN THE ACTIVITIES RIGHT THE POWER THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY COLLABORATION RIGHT COMMUNICATION. AND OLDER STRUCTURED LIBRARIES ARE BUILT. I MEAN I DON'T MEAN THIS MAINLY BUT OUR BUILT MORE AS A BOOK REPOSITORY MAN AS A LEARNING CENTER RIGHT THE SECOND THING IS LIBRARIES NOW AND THIS IS BEEN REINFORCED AFTER A YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC WHEN PHYSICAL DOORS WERE CLOSED. LIBRARIES NOW ARE OFFERING A MIX OF DIGITAL AND IN PERSON SERVICE SO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE LIBRARY THROUGH ITS DIGITAL DOORS NOW- AS OPPOSED TO AS OPPOSED TO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT THAT THAT'S BEEN AN INCREASING PATTERN RIGHT JUST AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME MORE DIGITALLY. CONNECTED I MEAN THERE'S A VARIETY OF STRUCTURAL. CHANGES TO. YOU KNOW FACILITATE THE CHANGING ROLE THAT LIBRARIES ARE PLAYING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES GOVERNOR NEWSOM CALLED THEM THE HEART OF THEIR COMMUNITIES IN IN HIS LIBRARY PROCLAMATION. AND I THINK IN IN MANY RESPECTS THAT ARE BECOMING THEM- IF THEY ARE IF THEY AREN'T ALREADY. I MIGHT I CAN SEND YOU SOME MORE ON ON THIS IS THAT IS THAT HELPING IT SO. TO GET BACK TO YOUR QUESTION I MEAN A BILLION DOLLARS HELPS ADDRESS THE MOST. PRESSING NEEDS BUT DOESN'T. HELP US FIX USUALLY THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT RIGHT- IT HELPS ADDRESS THE PRESSING NEEDS BUT A. B. SUSTAINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. TO MODERNIZE AND GROW IT IN THE CASES OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THAT HAVE HAD A HUGE POPULATION INCREASE OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS THE GIRL LIBRARY FACILITIES. IS THE SORT OF STRATEGY THAT'S NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTER. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. SENATOR TROUBLED GOOD MORNING- AND THANK YOU TO- EVERYONE HERE TODAY I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROVIDE THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE AMOUNT IF ANY OF FOR THE E. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE TWO THOUSAND GEO. BOND. JENNIFER LEEWITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE ANY FORMAL COMMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. SENATOR IF I MAY I THINK THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT AND REMAINING PAYMENTS ON THAT SERVICE IS THAT CORRECT YES. WE REMEMBER. FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR YEAH PERFECT THANK YOU GREAT YEAH WE ITS REGULAR AT THE LIBRARY WE DO WE MAY HAVE THAT AS WELL- JUST YOU KNOW IN OUR PAPERWORK CLOSE OUT ON THE- CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM SO WE WILL WORK WITH BRIANNA AND GET THAT THE GRANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THEN LET ME THANK EVERYONE ON THE FIRST PANEL- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE TO. UC AND CSU ENROLLMENT JASON CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE WILL BE BACK SIEGE OF BURTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RYAN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY.M. BRIAN RUTLEDGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WILL BEGIN WITH JASON CONSTANT TO ACROSS. WHICH IS IN CONSTANT TAURUS AGAIN LMAO. THIS ITEM BEFORE YOU FOLKS IS- FOCUSES ON ENROLLMENT AT UC AND CSU SO I'M GOING TO BE ADDRESSING EACH SEGMENT ONE OF THE TIME. FOR YOU SEE THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN. CONNECTS RESIDENT WOMAN GROWS TO A MULTI YEAR PLAN. THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCES NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. HOUSE PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA NOTES YOU SEE CURRENTLY HAS A POLICY IN PLACE TO LIMIT NONRESIDENTS MOMENTS- GOOD POLICY EFFECTIVELY. FOR MOST CAMPUSES- LIMITS NON RESIDENT ROMAN AS A SHARE OF- RESIDENT WILL HAVE A TOUGH TOTAL ENROLLMENT I'M NOT SURE IS BASICALLY LOCKED IN PLACE FOR MOST CAMPUSES. BY CONTRAST THIS PLAN THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT WOULD EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE SHARE FOR MOST CAMPUSES SO IT IS A REDUCTION IN ON REASONABLE AND RATHER THAN JUST A LITTLE. PAGE I'M NOT PAGE NINE OF YOUR AGENDA PROVIDES- A SUMMARY- ARE IN AND AN INITIAL SUMMARY OF THE OF THE PLAN UNDER THE SENATE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN. I'LL JUST WALK THROUGH IT REALLY QUICKLY IF YOU START AT THE- TOP OF THE TABLE YOU WILL SEE THE EFFORTS SIX CAMPUSES. OF THOSE CAMPUSES IT WOULD REDUCE THE SHARE OF THEIR FRIEND INCOMING FRESHMEN WHO ARE NON RESIDENTS. HE 10% AND THEY WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS OVER A ROUGHLY TEN YEAR PERIOD- THE REMAINING THREE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SHARES THAT ARE ALREADY BELOW 10% WOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE THEIR SHARES TO THAT 10% ONE THAT. I'M WHICH IS WHAT'S BEING DISPLAYED HERE ON THE TABLE. IF YOU MOVE TO THAT MIDDLE PART OF THE TABLE. DISPLAYS THE NUMBER OF FRESHMEN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE- GROWTH IN THE RESIDENT FRESHMAN IS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE GROWTH FOR THE REDUCTION OF NON RESIDENT. I THINK AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH IN NON RESIDENT MOMENT OUT THOSE REMAINING THREE CAMPUSES. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF ON WHAT- THIS PLAN MIGHT COST OUR INITIAL ESTIMATE- GOING TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE- PEOPLE THERE WOULD BE FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THAT WOULD BE BOTH TO- OR COVERED THE LAST REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING THE NONRESIDENT MOMENT. AND ALSO TO OTHER COSTS TO INCREASE RESIDENT WILL MANAGE. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS TABLE IT MIGHT REYES- TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION IT MIGHT RAISES WHY IS YOUR ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND NOT THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT UC HAS LARGELY MADE ITS FALL ADMISSION DECISIONS. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO YOU SEE LIKELY WOULD NEED AN ADDITIONAL YEAR BEFORE CAN START IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN TO REDUCE NON RESIDENT MOMENT. I ALSO NOTE THAT THE STATE BUDGET IN RECENT YEARS HAS TAKEN A SIMILAR APPROACH IS PROVIDED AN ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IN THE BUDGET BUT THEN SET THE TARGET FOR ONE YEAR LATER. FOR THE EXACT SAME REASON YOU SEE ALL HAS ALREADY MADE POLITICIAN DECISIONS BY THE TIME THE BUDGETS OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE SIGNAL TO MAKE PLANS FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. ON THE SECOND QUESTION THAT THIS PLAN MIGHT RAISE IS WHY IS THE RESIDENT. COST LARGER THAN THE NON RESIDENT COSTS. AT LEAST IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THERE ARE A FEW REASONS FOR THAT- ONE REASON IS THAT OUR OUR ESTIMATES INCLUDE SOME PROJECTIONS AND CONTINUING ENROLLMENT RATHER THAN JUST NEW ROMANCE AND THAT. INCREASES THE GROWTH IN RESIDENT MOMENT IN THE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PLAN. THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE POLICY BUT IT IS A GROWTH THAT WE PROJECT YOU SEE MAY ENCOUNTER AND IT'S A COST THAT THE- LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AS PART OF ITS- FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS. ALSO THAT RESIDENT ROMAN NUMBER INCLUDES ON THE COST OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHEN THE STATE INCREASES RESIDENT MOMENT THAT YOU SEE. NOT ONLY DOES IT INCREASE. COSTS ASSOCIATED HIRING MORE FACULTY AND STAFF. IT ALSO INCREASED COST TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND ON THE CALDERON PROGRAM. SO THOSE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THERE AS WELL. ONE FINAL THING TO NOTE IS THAT THIS IS A MULTI YEAR PLAN SO EACH YEAR YOU SEE IS CONTINUING TO INCREASE RESIDENT. AND REDUCING NON RESIDENT MOMENT AND SO EACH YEAR THE COSTS ESCALATE WE ESTIMATE THAT EVENTUALLY THE ONGOING COSTS WOULD RISE TO ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOT FOR FINAL YEAR GLOBALIZATION. AND THEIR AFTER THAT WOULD BE THE ONGOING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S THE YOU SEE- PLAN FOR CSU THE PLAN IS A LITTLE SIMPLER SO GO THROUGH A LOT QUICKER. ON THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN AIMS TO INCREASE SEE IF YOU RESIDENT MOMENT- BUT WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN NON RESIDENT WOMAN AND THIS IS BECAUSE IT CSU NONRESIDENT MOMENT IS ALREADY. LESS THAN 10% OF TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. I'M HERE STAFF INDICATES THAT THE ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR CSU HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED ON THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE FINALIZED. AFTER THE REVISION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WILL MOVE TO US TO JUDGE BURTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU CHIRLA HEARD AND MEMBERS I'M SAY EVER CANNON REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GRADUATES. IT'S APPROVED THE FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY PLAN WITH THE INTENT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER IF YOU SEE DECREASED BY CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS FOR LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY. TWENTY THIRTY INCREASES THE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES BECAUSE WHEN STUDENTS GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MATTER UNIVERSITY CAN ADMIT MORE STUDENTS FOR THE FOLLOWING CLASS. YOU SEE REQUEST THAT YOU PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR OUR CAMPUS IS TO CLOSE GRADUATION GAPS AS PART OF YOUR STRATEGY FOR MORE UC INVOLVEMENT. UC'S ABILITY TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS IS DEPENDENT ON STATE SUPPORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES. WITH TWO YEARS OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH SPENDING THAT A LOT OF YOU SEE TOMORROW NOT JUST OUR LARGEST EVER INCOMING UNDERGRADUATE CLASS. ARE DISCUSSED EVER OF UNDER. MINORITY STUDENTS. YOU SEE ALSO ENROLLS MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAN ANY OTHER RESEARCH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS STATES ROBUST CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AND UC'S INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE 456% OF OUR CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. TUITION AND FEES FULLY COVERED. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU SEE HAS INCREASED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT BY NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. PROVIDED YOU SEE WITHIN ROMAN TARGETS AND FUNDING FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THOSE STUDENTS LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY TO COVER THE COST OF EDUCATION FOR THE REMAINING FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED. CITY ENSURES HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR THESE UNFUNDED CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STUDENTS AND PART. AVENUE COLLECTED FROM OUR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. OKAY A SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION IN ADDITION THE MANDATORY TUITION AND FEES THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE CHARGED. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OVER 14% OF OUR CAMPUS OR FUNDS FOR NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID BY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. IT OPENS ARE SPENT ON MANY ASPECTS OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS FROM HIRING FACULTY TO OFFER MORE COURSES THE STUDENT SERVICES AND FINANCIAL AID FOR RESIDENT STUDENTS MAINTAINING CAMPUS FACILITIES. NONRESIDENT THE REVENUE IS AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE THAT THE UC REGENTS CAN INCREASE EVERY YEAR REFLECTING THIS REVENUE SOURCE WITH A FIXED ALLOCATION OF STATE GENERAL FUND WOULD LIMIT THE UNIVERSITY'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO INFLATIONARY COST PRESSURES. AND CREATE A FINANCIAL LONGER ABILITY IN THE FUTURE RECESSION. INSTEAD OF REMOVING A GROUP OF STUDENTS UNIVERSITY REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE INSTEAD PROVIDE FUNDS TO ENROLL MORE CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. WOULD PREFERRED THAT THE LEGISLATURE PRE FUNDED MOMENT NOW NOT JUST FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS WELL SO THAT THE UNIVERSITY CAN ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR DEER ARRIVAL OF THE NEW CALL WORK. WE REQUESTED ANY NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT BE FUNDED AT THE FULL MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION. INCREASING CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES DRUG BUDGET ALLOCATION WITH AN ENROLLMENT TARGET IS ALSO FAR LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE AND A BUYOUT PROGRAM OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. ENROLLMENT TARGET THE LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT UNIVERSITY TO INVOLVE MORE STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE UNDER THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT REPLACEMENT PLAN OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA. ONGOING ENROLLMENT FUNDING WOULD ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO COMPETENTLY HIGHER FACULTIES PROVIDE INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE CONCERNS OF REPLACING ANOTHER ON GOING REVENUE SOURCE TOGETHER WE CAN ENSURE ACCESS AND SUCCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF RYAN STORM FROM CSU. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. IN ODER SENATOR SIGNED STILL IS JUST VICE FOR THE- STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR OFFICE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- TO. THE COMMITTEE TODAY. SO KEEPING COMMENTS BRIEF ALL FOCUSED ON TWO MAJOR THEMES THE FIRST IS A SUMMARY OF ENROLLMENT AT THE C. ISSUE. AND THE SECOND IS OUR COMMENTARY AS YOU CONSIDER GROWING ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY. SO SINCE THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION THE STATE AND THE SPEECH YOU HAVE ADDED FORTY ONE THOUSAND NEW FUNDED SEATS AT THE C. ISSUE. TODAY pSTUDENTS IN ITS HISTORY THAT IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. SYSTEM WIDE WE ARE ABOUT 5% OVER ARE FUNDED ENROLLMENT LEVELS. ENROLLMENT IS VERY STRONG IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IN ROLE THAT HAS NOT BEEN A STRONG IN OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES RECENTLY. OUR SYSTEM WHY THE CROWN OF VIRUS DID NOT IMPACT OUR ENROLLMENT LEVELS THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED TO THEIR LOCAL CAMPUS. THERE IS STRONG DEMAND AT OUR FULLER TEN SO SAN DIEGO AND SAN LUIS OBISPO CAMPUS SINCE AND EVEN AT THOSE CAMPUSES STRONG MAJORITIES OF LOCAL STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED. IT MISTER PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO LOCAL STUDENTS AT EVERY ISSUE CAMPUS. NOW NOT EVERYONE WHO IS. ELIGIBLE SUBMITTED TO THEIR FIRST CHOICE CAMPUS. THAT IS SIMPLY THE ECONOMICS OF DEMAND EXCEEDING SUPPLY. TELL US YOUR PERSPECTIVE STUDENTS HAVE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR A SEIZURE EDUCATION. THE UNIVERSITY HAS FOR THREE FALL ADMISSIONS CYCLES IMPLEMENTED A REDIRECTION POLICY THAT PROVIDES ALL PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND THE SECOND OR THIRD CHOICE CAMPUS. NO WE DON'T JUST OFFER STUDENT ACCESS THEY GRADUATE. INTO SEVENTH GRADER RATES EACH YEAR. AND I AM PLEASED TO CONTINUE TO REPORT THEIR GRADUATION RATES CONTINUE ON THIS UPWARD TRAJECTORY IN EVERY CATEGORY. LAST YEAR. HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS EARN THEIR DEGREES IN THE CSU. THAT'S A SUMMARY OF OUR ROLE THAT CSU. NOW TOTALING GROSS AND ARE UNSOLICITED FEEDBACK AS YOU CONSIDER FUNDING ADDITIONAL SEATS AT THE UNIVERSITY. THE SENATE'S BILL BACK ALL THE PLANS SIX DEGREES ROMAN AT THE CSU THERE ARE SEVERAL CONDITIONS THOUGH THAT MUST BE MET FOR THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT THE CSU. FIRST IT IS SEIZE HIS POSITION TO SEE ISSUES GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MUST FIRST BE FULLY FUNDED WITH SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING SUNDAY. A FULLY FUNDED INITIATIVE WILL HELP US REACH OUR GOAL OF ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS FOR CURRENT STUDENTS AND THEY ARE OUR FIRST PRIORITY. ONLY AFTER THAT UNIVERSITY PRIORITY IS FUNDED DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONSIDER THE DISCRETIONARY CHOICE OF ADDING MORE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO THE CSU. SECOND ENROLLMENT TRAINING MUST BE ONGOING IT CANNOT BE ONE. TIME OR ONE TIME FUNDING CANNOT SUSTAIN MORE PERMANENT FACULTY AND STAFF NEEDED TO EDUCATE STUDENTS. THIRD THE STATE'S SHARE NEW ROLLING COSTS WOULD BE EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT. THAT'S LIKE- MR TIME AND WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT'S THE FULL MARGINAL COST OF EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH THIS ISSUE. SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU PROVIDED EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY WE CAN EDUCATE ABOUT A THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS. A FOURTH IN ROMAN TARGETS MUST BE SAID IT FUNDED LEVELS. IF THE SENATE WERE TO INCLUDE AN ENROLLMENT TARGET IN THE BUDGET THE STARTING POINT IS. THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. SIXTY YEARS THE STATE AND THE UNIVERSITYHAVE METICULOUSLY ADDED NEW FUNDING AND NEW STUDENT A QUIBBLE AND EXPECTATIONS TO ARRIVE AT THAT CURRENT NUMBER. THAT'S A DECADES OLD CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK TO EDUCATE THAT THAT NUMBER OF STUDENTS. IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE TO GROWING ROLE THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE FUNDING AND GROW THE ENROLLMENT TARGET. NOW FIFTH AND LASTLY C. ISSUES POSITION IS THAT MEETING A NEW TARGET SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE SECOND COLLEGE YEAR AND NOT THE FIRST. MISTER CONSTANT TAURUS AND THIS FOR TEN AND MENTIONED THAT ISSUE AS WELL. PRACTICALLY THAT WOULD BE MEETING TARGET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE COLLEGE YEAR AND NOT THIS UPCOMING. ACADEMIC YEAR THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT ALL IN A CAMPUS ADMISSION DECISIONS IN GENERAL THAT DECISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. FOR THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR OUR FIRST DAY CLASSES TYPICALLY IS AROUND THE THIRD WEEK OF AUGUST SO THERE'S REALLY NO TIME TO ADD. MORE STAFF OR STUDENTS AT THIS POINT. IF YOU WERE TO GROWING ONLY. TO HELP YOU FIND A TESTIMONY HELPFUL AS YOU MAKE THOSE FINAL DECISIONS ON SEIZE YOUR MOMENT. MY COLLEAGUE DR EQUAL CARRILLO THE DIRECTOR OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AT THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS HERE ALSO. TODAY TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND OUR LAST AMONG THE INITIAL PRESENTATION SAYS BRIAN RUTLEDGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THE MORNING CARE MEMBERS BRIAN RUTLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR UC'S CSU. AND THE EARLY ACTION FROM FEBRUARY. THANK YOU OKAY WISH YOU COULD TAKE A QUESTIONS ON HIS MAY REVISED BUT- RIGHT WHERE WE GET THE WHAT'S GOING ON LT ME BEGIN WITH SOME QUESTIONS AND I WOULD LIKE TO. THE FOCUS FIRST AT SIERRA OF VIRGIN AND ARE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU LISTED ALL THE FACTORS. OF THAT MIGHT AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT OR MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH. UP BUT YOU DID NOT ADDRESS THE SUBJECT OF FACILITIES IT SEEMS THAT YOUR COMMENTS WERE BASED ON- JUST MAXIMIZING CURRENT FACILITIES. R. A. N. DEFENDER STARTING TO BUMP UP AGAINST THE DEMAND OF NOT BEING IS YOU SEE HAVE A PLAN IN ANY WAY TO INCREASE FACILITIES AND THEREFORE INCREASE THE ABILITY TO- ARE AT ENROLLMENT. THANK YOU SIR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DID SEND- THE GOVERNOR AIM NAY REVISED PROPOSAL REQUESTING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION INCLUDING SEISMIC RENOVATIONS AND- IT CLASSROOM MODERNIZATION PROJECTS BUT WE DO ALSO HAVE OUR CAMPUS LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS. WHICH PLAN WORKS SERVICE GUIDELINES OR INCREASING ENROLLMENT AND ACADEMIC PLANNING OF BY CALLING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN BUILDINGS ON THE CAMPUS SAYS BUT THERE DEFINITELY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO CONSTRUCT NEW FACILITIES IN ORDER TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT. WE DO BELIEVE WEST- OUR EXISTING FACILITIES AND WITH THE HELP OF EXPANDED SUMMER ESPECIALLY IN ON THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT THERE MAY BE ABILITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO GROW UP AT ITS PRESENT PHYSICAL CAPACITY AS WELL. AND AS YOU MENTIONED THE REQUEST OF. TO THE GOVERNOR FOR MARY THAT SUBSTANTIALLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WILL THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ROOM FOR STUDENTS ORSETT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO JUST MAINTAIN. THE CAPACITY FOR EXISTING LEVELS OF ENROLLMENT. OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REQUEST- MAINTAINS THE EXISTING CAPACITY BARN ROLE WITH- AND WHAT WE DO HAVE- SOME PLANS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AND RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS IT'S REALLY THE BUILDING RENOVATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND CAPACITY BECAUSE MANY OF OUR OLDER CAMPUSES HAVE CLASSROOM CAPACITY THAT. DOESN'T REALLY SUPPORT THE MODERN PEDAGOGY ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCES AND SCIENCE LABS AND SOME OF THOSE CLASSROOMS ARE GOING UNDER UTILIZED IF THEY COULD BE RENOVATED WE COULD HAVE MORE COURSES ARE MOVING THROUGH THOSE CLASSROOM FACILITIES. BUT IT IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OVERALL THAT THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH HAD. OUR OUR CAPACITY WITH ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS AND SOME CAMPUSES AND THE EXPANDED SUMMER OPPORTUNITIES AND THE RENOVATIONS WHICH MIGHT INCREASE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF MODERNIZATION. WOULD ACTUALLY MEET THE DEMAND OR ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THAT WOULD MEET THE DEMAND TO THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE TO COME INTO THE UC SYSTEM. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW SERVER YOU ARE DEFINING MEETING THE DEMAND CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ADMITS ABOUT 13% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. GRADUATES INTO- OUR SYSTEM NOT ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS END UP ENROLLING- ORDING TO THE MASTER PLAN YOU SEE IS MEETING THAT DEMAND. FORCE IN ADMITTING THIRD HIGHEST- ARE GRADE LEVELS ARE HIGHEST QUALIFYING CALIFORNIA BASICALLY THE PERCENTAGE THAT. THAT IS SPELLED OUT IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR YOU SEE YOU BELIEVE THIS MAT WITH BUDGET REQUESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE TABLE. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I'M SAYING THAT CURRENTLY UC ADMITS- NO I KNOW YOU'RE GIVEN ME THE NUMBERS BUT I'M TRYING TO DO THEY'RE SORT OF A PERCENTAGE DEMANDED SLIDE OUT INTO IN THE MASTER PLAN AND I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF WHAT YOUR PLANS TO ADMIT MATCH THE PERCENTAGE IN THE MASTER PLAN. CURRENTLY WE ARE PLANNING ON AND- HOLDING IN ROMAN FLAG FOOTBALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNLESS WE RECEIVE NEW. ENROLLMENT FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE- BUT THAT ENROLLMENT LEVEL WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET THE MASTERPLAN PERCENTAGE. ABOUT WE HEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEFINITELY WANTS TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLERS WANTING TO GET INTO THE UC SYSTEM. AND WE THINK WE CAN WORK WITH YOU. AS LONG AS WE RECEIVE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION TO HIRE NEW INSTRUCTORS WE THINK WE CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE PASSED A MORE HIGH SCHOOLERS COMING IN S. CALIFORNIA FRESHMAN TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM- THIS FALL EVEN. IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING TO HIRE FACULTY. OKAY WELL. ARE ANSWERED I THINK ONE OF THE SUB TAX ONE OF THE SUB TAX- FOR ME IS REPRESENTING- UC CAMPUS IN MY DISTRICT WITH THE LATEST LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN SHOWS THEM GOING TO A MAXIMUM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS THAT ARE CREATED I'M TRYING TO LOOK IF MEETING THE MASTER PLAN NEEDS. FALLS ON THAT OR BUILDING OUT AT MERCED REQUIRING MILLS COLLEGE OTHER THINGS MIGHT ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE GROWTH THAT CHORE ANTICIPATING FOR THE SENATE AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THE I KNOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS DELAYED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS OVER THE CITING AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UC MERCED CAMPUS I AM JUST WONDERING AND MAYBE THE POSSIBILITY OF MILLS COLLEGE TAKES THAT OFF THE TABLE WHETHER WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL CENTERS OR FACILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH OVER TIME WHEN I HAD THE YEAR TO YEAR. ANSWER I KNOW THAT'S IN FRONT OF US WITH REGARD TO THIS BUDGET BUT IF I AM HERE FOR FOUR YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS THEY'LL BE FUTURE BUDGETS WHERE PEOPLE ASK VOTED PEOPLE PLAN FOR THIS EVENTUALITY WILL THIS IS THE TIME YOU PLANNED FOR THIS IS THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHEN THIS THE SUN IS SHINING ECONOMICALLY ON THE BUDGET THOSE ARE THE TIMES TO SORT OF DEAL WITH THAT SO THAT'S- WHAT I WAS A DRIVING AT IN AND I THINK OUR EXCHANGES MADE THE POINTS BUT IT IT. DID HI I JUST WANNA PUT THAT OUT THERE IS AN ISSUE THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT AND. ASK THE UC REPRESENTATIVE. IS ABOVE YOU. ON THE NOTION OF OUT OF STATE TUITION OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AND MEN THAT PERCENT. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD DO OTHER THAN THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TO ACCOMMODATED. AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT THE UNIVERSITY WHAT YOU SEE WAS FOR WITH REGARD TO OUT OF STATE STUDENTS YOU NAMED ALL THE ALTERNATIVES- FOR. BUT OVER TIME IS YOU SEE IN FAVOR OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS I DIDN'T GET THAT FROM YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS ARE WE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF REDUCING OUR OUT OF STATE. STUDENTS MORE THAN THE REGION'S TOP SO WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE TOP ON NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. ADOPTED BY THE UC REGENTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE THINK THAT- HELPS THE UNIVERSITY MAINTAIN. OUR REVENUE SOURCES AND ALSO. ALLOWS A STATEMENT ARE CONTINUALLY MORE CALIFORNIA. RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES INTO OUR SYSTEM HOW TO IS LEAVING THE NUMBER HIVE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS ALLOW YOU TO ADMIT MORE IN STATE STUDENTS. BECAUSE CURRENTLY ARE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS HE AB. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLAR ADDITIONAL FEE. ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE REVENUE TO HIRE MORE INSTRUCTORS STAND BY THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS- OUR STATE FUNDING PER STUDENT HAS- DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN INCREASING. STATE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE WE HAVE COST EXPENDITURES HAVE GROWN SO MUCH AND WE'VE TAKEN ON NEW ENROLLMENT- THAT ARE DOLLARS PER STUDENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FALLING BUT WE CAN SPEND SO RESTRICTING DOC NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION REVENUE SOURCE WOULD MEAN THAT IN A CASE OF A RECESSION WE WILL HAVE LESS MONEY TO FALL BACK ON IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN QUALITY DIFFICULT. FINANCIAL TIMES. AND SO THIS THIS TIES TOGETHER DIRECTLY WITH THE FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS I WAS ASKING BECAUSE IF. IT SEEMS THAT THE CONTENTION IS THAT HAVING OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AT THE LEVEL THAT IT IS NOW IS NOT IN ANY WAY DISADVANTAGING OR CAUSING IN STATE STUDENTS TO BE TURNED AWAY FROM ADMISSIONS IS THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING. THAT IS CORRECT SIR- IN FACT AT THE MOMENT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS OVER FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES ENROLLED FOR HOME WE'VE NOT RECEIVED THE STATE OF MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION SHARE. AND IF WE START REDUCING OUR NON RESIDENT POPULATION WHO ARE CURRENTLY PAYING FOR THOSE STUDENTS- IT DOES REDUCE THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE STUDENTS OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD NEVER KICK OUT. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENT UP BUT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT MAINTAINING THE QUALITY IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND YOU SEE QUALITY SEEMS TO BE CORRELATED WITH HIGH MONEY COMING FROM OUT OF STATE AND I DO THINK THAT. THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US BACK FEELS THAT MONEY AND THE IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL THE IN STATE STUDENTS AND- AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT. THE STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT THE MASTER PLAN PERCENTAGES MATT I JUST GET SO MANY CALLS FROM PARENTS TO FEEL LIKE THEIR KIDS ARE GETTING INTO UC AND SO I THINK THAT IS A GENUINE CONCERN. FROM THE COMMITTEE AND I DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE PROPOSAL AS A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU SEE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE BUT- EQUITY ISSUE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE ANIMATED DEBATE LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS WELL THERE IS A HAND FROM THE PERSON I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU HAD A COMMENT- DOES THE. L. A- WISH TO COMMENT ON THIS. YEAH THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP- JUST PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE DISCUSSION- JUST HAD- AND WE DID LOOK AT- THAT'S YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON LOOKING AT DEMAND AND CAPACITY AT UC. AS WELL SEE THIS YEAR WE DID LOOK AT THAT A FEW YEARS AGO IN A REPORT- AND I ACTUALLY JUST SAW IT JUST ON THE DEMAND POINT I THINK ONE THING JUST TO JUST TO. SHARPEN KEEP IN MIND AS YOU SAID YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. IS THAT- YOU SEE HAS HISTORICALLY BAD THE MASTER PLAN- TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT ELIGIBILITY FULL- BUT IN RECENT YEARS THEY'VE HAD TO INCREASINGLY- REFER STUDENTS TO- CAMPUSES LIKE RIVER CITING MERCED. CAMPUS IS THAT MAY BE WORTH THEIR FIRST CHOICE OR THAT THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO. AND A LOT OF THE STUDENTS END UP CHOOSING NOT TO ENROLL YOU SEE- AND SO ONE OF THE- KEY ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN- NOT JUST EXPANDING ACCESS SYSTEM WIDE BUT CONTINUING TO SPEND EXPAND ACCESS OF THESE HIGHER DEMAND CAMPUSES LIKE BERKELEY AND UCLA AND SAN DIEGO. AND IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT- OPTIONS TO EXPAND WILL THAT. ON THAT WOULD BE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE NON RESIDENT PLAN THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING- SPECIFICALLY LOOKS AT EVERY CAMPUS AND PRESUMABLY ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS- THAT IT IS TARGETING THESE HIGHER DEMAND CAMPUSES THAT HAVE THESE. HIGHER SHARES NONRESIDENT STUDENTS- YOU DON'T IN TERMS OF CAPACITY AGAIN- JUST IT JUST IT PROVIDE A LOT MORE INFORMATION THEIR- COMMON WE LOOK AT CAPACITY ISSUES WHICH WE DO SEE SOME- ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AT SOME OF THESE ARE HIGH DEMAND CAMPUSES FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SPACES- BUT AS- A SINGER REFERRED TO- A LOT OF THE SPACES ARE- CLASSROOMS THAT ARE- THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKE SMALLER CLASSROOMS ARE NOT NECESSARILY CAN FIGURE TO THE WAY THEY DELIVER INSTRUCTION TODAY THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE WAS REFERRING TO THE RENOVATION OF FACILITIES THAT THAT COULD BE ONE WAY. TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF THOSE FACILITIES IS BY RECONFIGURING MOM- AS YOU AS IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT SEGMENTS ALSO- COULD EXPAND SUMMER MOMENT MORE THAN IT DOES ANOTHER WAY ON THAT DATE STATUS HISTORICALLY TRYING TO EXPAND- ENROLLMENT WITHOUT AN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES. I WOULD ALSO THERE IS THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT LONG RANGE DEVELOP PLANS AND THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY OKAY THIS IS A TOLD US EVEN IF THEY DO HAVE UNDER UTILIZED FACILITIES SOMETIMES THEY FACE SOME EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS. ALL LIKE THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS CONNECT- AND ROMAN GROWTH JOB INCREASES IN HOUSING SO THAT DOES CREATE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM SOME SOME CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR ABILITY TO. MEET YOUR TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT EXPECTATIONS AND SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER TOO IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPACITY RULES. I JUST HOPE THAT HOPEFULLY IN FOR. PROVIDES A LITTLE IT DOES AND IT AND I DO HAVE A HAND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE I RECOGNIZE HIM I FEEL OBLIGATED TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING. AND IT'S- JUST I DON'T WANT SILENCE TO SORT OF- IT HERE THAT. MMHM RIVERSIDE AND PARTICULARLY MERCED OR INFERIOR CAMPUSES IN SOME WAY. AND MERCED IN PARTICULAR. HAS GONE FROM ZERO TO SIXTY IN PROVIDING EXCELLENT EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES EVEN THOUGH. WE PROBABLY SHOULD FUNDED SO IT'S NOT A HUNDRED AND NINE EVERY TIME SOMEBODY SITS OUTSIDE OR TO GRADUATION A BECAUSE THERE'S NOT IT'S AN INTERIOR BUILDING TO DO THAT. BUT OUR OUR OUR I WANT TO SPEAK FOR THOSE CAMPUSES AND IN TERMS OF THE EXCELLENCE OF THE EDUCATION MISDIRECT WATTAGE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE TEACHER LEARNED I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHARES THE CONCERNS YOU'RE RAISING THE QUESTIONS. THEY'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT THAT THE THERE'S TWO INVESTMENTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR CAPACITY FOR BOTH UC AND CSU. BUT THE FIRST IS THAT WERE. PROPOSING GOVERNOR'S BUDGET 3% BASED AUGMENTATION THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THREE POINT NINE MILLION FOR YOU SEE AND HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR CSU. ATTACHED TO THAT IS AN EXPECTATION THAT ARE BOTH SEGMENTS WILL ADOPT POLICIES WHERE THEY HAVE TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE ONLINE OFFERINGS THAN PRE COVE IT. WHAT THAT'S PRIMARILY AIMED AT AND STUDENT ACCESS BUT AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WHAT ONLINE CAPACITY DOES IS IT DOES TAKE SOME PRESSURE OFF INSTABILITIES POTENTIALLY SO I WANTED A FLAG THAT. I ALSO WANTED A FLAG THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. FOR YOU SEE AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. ONE TIME FOR CSU AND SO THOSE ARE ALSO FACILITIES CAPACITY AND SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT- NOT BEEN VISITED BY BOTH BRANCHES TO THEN SAY THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE AS WELL TERMS AND FOR MAINTENANCE SO. JUST FOR THE RECORD OUT TO SHORT CIRCUIT COMMENTS THAT ARE OTHERWISE ABOUT TO COME. UP ARE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS. FIVE FOLLOW UP ON TO. ASK FOR- SENATOR MINUTES OF FOLLOW UPS OF AHEAD AND THEN IF CENTER GROW TROUBLE BECAUSE OF. OR RECOGNIZE I MAY THIS AND- BUT- ACCORDING TO. KELLY REPORT WE HAVE- IT APPEARS WE'RE LOOKING TO ALLOCATE FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. TO COVER THE COSTS- THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. A NEW FRESHMAN ENROLLMENT AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE REVENUE THAT UC'S WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM. NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. ARE MAYBE I MISSED THIS BUT IT TO THE UC REPRESENTATIVE ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO COVER. YOUR COSTS OF THE DECREASED REVENUES. YOU COULD RECEIVE FROM OUT OF STATE TUITION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- THE FUNDING WHICH LIKE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE NUANCES OF THE FUNDING BUT THE PROPOSAL AS IT IS- WOULD REPLACE. THE REVENUE LOST FROM THOSE NON RESIDENTS. I THINK WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THAT AMOUNT WOULD THEN BE FIXED WELL AS ARE NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION. INCREASES WITH INFLATION THAT AMOUNT WOULD STAY THE SAME AND POTENTIALLY DISAPPEAR IN A FUTURE RECESSION WHICH IS WHAT WE FEAR- ALSO IT'S FAR CHEAPER FOR YOU. TO PROVIDE US WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING FOR RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT WOULD COST YOU ABOUT TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS PER STUDENT. VERSUS THE PLAN IN FRONT OF YOU THE REPLACE THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WOULD COST YOU. ABOUT 400-002-0080 FOUR DOLLARS PER STUDENT. WE CAN WE CAN GROW CAPACITY FOR NEXT FALL AND THE FOLLOWING FALL AND LIKE CENTER LEARNED SAID YOU CAN WORK WITH YOU ON A CONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR BUILDINGS. INCREASED OUR CAMPUS CAPACITY EVEN FURTHER SO WE WOULD REQUEST THAT YOU ALLOW THE REGION'S PLAN TO STAY FOR NOW. AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON GROWING CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT THROUGH. ANOTHER MEANS THANK YOU. I THAT- NOW I HAD A DIFFERENT LINE OF QUESTIONING- I REALIZE WORTH LOOKING AT ENROLLMENT- YOU KNOW WE'RE OBVIOUSLY COMING OUT OF AN UNUSUAL TIME AND I SUSPECT WILL BE CARING FOR THIS CONVERSATION AROUND NONRESIDENT STUDENTS- FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT- AS WE- EMERGE OUT OF THE COPA PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY AND I ASSUME THAT ALL THE U. SEASON CSU'S. LOOKING TO. REOPEN PHYSICAL INSTRUCTION I'M INTERESTED IN IN HEARING ABOUT WHAT THE SYSTEM Y. PLANS MIGHT BE ON A COVERT PREVENTION- SAFETY AS WELL AS- WHETHER YOU'RE PLANNING TO OFFER ANY- ONLINE OR VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION ASIDE FROM THE 10% THE THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO SEE- FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE COMING BACK IN AND I. JUST LOOK AT THIS LA TIMES STORY CAME OUT THIS WEEK HOUSE ONLY 7% OF LOS ANGELES HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. I HAVE RETURNED TO THE CLASSROOM AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT OUT OF. OUT OF A COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM YOU. KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO AND WHETHER THOSE EFFORTS ARE COVERED BY THE VARIOUS- BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING. FAVOR TEN AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A DECISION ON RE OPENING OUR CAMPUSES CLOSER TO JULY. WE'RE CURRENTLY GATHERING INFORMATION ON HOW MANY OF OUR STAFF FACULTY AND STUDENTS ARE VACCINATED AT THE MOMENT. WE WANT TO FOLLOW ALL STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION RE OPENING. WE HAVE JUST INTRODUCED A DRAFT POLICY THAT WE'RE GATHERING COMMENTS ON. THE REQUIRE OF OUR STUDENTS TO BE VACCINATED AGAINST KOBE AND ONCE. UP FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED FULL AUTHORIZATION FOR THAT VACCINE. IT'S ON- EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION SO WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THE VACCINE FROM OUR STUDENTS AT THIS TIME- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE 70% OF OUR- STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF OXIDATIVE BEFORE. WE CONSIDER THE CAMPUSES- IT'S BY FAR CORPORATE RE OPENING SO THERE WILL BE UP FOR FALL. STILL ONLINE COURSES AVAILABLE AND WE HOPE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE ONLINE COURSES AVAILABLE PERMANENTLY. UP FOR OUR STUDENTS SO. THAT EVERYONE CAN BE SAFE. THANK YOU AND FROM THE CSU'S. SIR RYAN STORM VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT- S. B. BRITTAN WAS DESCRIBING I THINK OUR- COMMENT POLICIES ALIGN VERY CLOSELY WHERE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THE EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION AND THEY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ALL STAFF AND STUDENTS AND FACULTY- IN THE FALL. THAT THEY WILL BE VACCINATED- IN TERMS OF- COURSE OFFERINGS WE HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE ARE ARE DYING TO GET BACK ON CAMPUS AND HAVE THAT COLLEGE EXPERIENCE IN THAT IN IN PERSON INTERACTION. IN SOARED CAMPUSES ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE TAKEN OFFERS MADE THOSE COURSES PLANNING TO OFFERS ME THOSE COURSES POSSIBLE AS WELL AS OFFER A LOT OF ONLINE ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS THERE TOO SO I THINK THE NEW NORMAL GOING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE OFFERINGS OF HYBRID OR FULLY ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUCCESS AND IT DOES WORK FOR. A STUDENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- WHERE YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK UP AN ONLINE COURSE IN THE EVENING- WHEREAS BEFORE THAT THE NORMAL ATTENDING COLLEGE WAS TO BE THERE IN PERSON DURING DURING DAYLIGHT SO THOSE ARE OPTIONS GOING FORWARD OF COURSE IS ALL PREDICATED ON THE FACT OF HOW THIS HOW THIS DISEASE NEWS AND SHAKES AS WE GO FORWARD RIGHT- RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD IN TERMS OF CASE NUMBERS AND OUR ABILITY TO RE OPEN AS MUCH AS WE CAN. BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BIG STAR OR AN ACTOR ASTERIX BY IT WHERE WHERE AS WE JUST HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND IT IF THINGS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BUT- I THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING THAT'S THAT'S NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT REPOPULATION AND YOU NEED AND EVEN ONLINE OFFERINGS. THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE ABOUT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT SUPPLIED TO EACH OF OUR CAMPUSES DIRECTLY TO OFFER- BOTH OF THOSE- BOTH OF THOSE PIECES SO I WOULD SAY FROM ACT DEALING WITH COVANTA AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SAID WE HAVE AMPLE MONEY THERE TO DEAL WITH THOSE PIECES DIRECTLY. I APPRECIATE. THAT ANSWER AND I ALSO WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T CONGRATULATE THE UC RIGHT- ON. THE ASK ANY PERFORMING- A VERY YOU SEASON UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. BERKELEY IN THIS WEEK'S- I FORGET HIS U. S. NEWS OR PRINCETON REVIEW BUT THAT. WAS A CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT PERFORMANCE. THANK YOU A. N. I ALSO WANNA I NOTICE YOU PAUSED AFTER YOU SEE AND THEN ADDED BERKELEY AND WE'VE HAD TWO CONFIRMATIONS IN FRONT OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. INCLUDING THE COMMANDER OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL LAST WEEK WHERE SHE JUST LISTED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON A RESUME NOTHING ELSE AND THEN IF COULD SHE JUST ASSUMED WE ALL KNEW THAT IT MEANT BERKELEY AND SO I CALLED HER OUT UNDER CHAUVINISM BY TEN FROM UC IRVINE SO YEAH SONORA FROM THAT AND I'M A SLOW GETS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC. SENATE ROAD SHOW ABOVE DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS NO QUESTIONS WERE GOOD SO THAT COMPLETES THIS ITEM AND IT WAS AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION WILL TAKE IT ALL INTO ACCOUNT I WANT TO THANK. OUR PANELISTS FOR PARTICIPATING AND WE WILL MOVE TO THE THIRD AND LAST ITEM WHICH IS DEBT FREE COLLEGE INTO HERE BASICALLY THE SENATE'S A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT AND THE FOUR PANELISTS ARE. WITH A CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE LARA SAYS BEAUCOUP BIRDS FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS JERRY BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND GABRIELA CHAVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'LL DO IT IN. THE IN THAT ORDER AND BEGIN WITH. THE L. A. L. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU TO MY TEN MEMBERS. BE THINKING WITH THE LEAD TO PANEL OFFICE. AS HE NOTED WITH AN ASPECT COMMITTEE STAFF TODAY TO PRESENT THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE. DISCIPLINE CONSISTS OF VARIOUS OPTIONS WHICH YOU'LL SEE OUTLINED IN YOUR CHEN DEAD BEGINNING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOURTEEN. THE FIRST SET OF OPTIONS FOR LATEST EXPANDING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ALREADY. WELL HOW CANCER NEED BASED PROGRAM THERE ARE CURRENTLY A NUMBER OF ELIGIBILITY RULES IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL. SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS MUST HAVE A GRADE POINT AVERAGE OF AT LEAST TWO POINT OH OR HIGHER FOR CERTAIN TALKING AWAY TYPES. AS WE DISCUSSED IN A SEPARATE HEARING THERE ARE ALSO SOME REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO AGING TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL CURRENTLY ONLY RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND TRANSFER STUDENTS UNDER AGE TWENTY EIGHT OUR ENTITLED TO ACCOUNT GRANT SHOULD THE INTELLIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. OLDER STUDENTS ARE CONSIDERED FOR ONE OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS. NOTES THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER. REMOVING HIS ELIGIBILITY VARIOUS WRITING TO AGING TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS REMOVING THE GPA REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTENTS WERE PROMPTLY. DOING SO IS ESTIMATED TO ADD A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND RECIPIENTS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. THE SECOND BUCKET OF OPTIONS BEFORE YOU IS RELATED TO TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CALVIN FUNDING GOES TOWARD PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH TUITION COVERAGE. OPTIONS HERE BEFORE YOU ARE RELATED TO ASSISTING STUDENTS WITH THEIR LIVING COSTS SUCH AS FOOD AND HOUSING. THE ACCESSIBLE WORK THIS IS A NONTRADITIONAL ARE CURRENTLY WORTH ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THE LOWER INCOME TALKING RECIPIENTS RECEIVING THAT THE AWARD. THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO CONSIDER INCREASING THE AWARD AMOUNT. THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION RELATED TO THE STUDENT SUCCESS COMPLETION GRANT THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL WORK AVAILABLE TO CALLAHAN RECIPIENTS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN FAIRFIELD FULL TIME. THE OPTION IS TO EITHER INCREASE THE AWARD AMOUNT ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL OF UP TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. OR TO INCREASE DEBT PROGRAM EXTEND THE PROGRAM TO ALSO INCLUDE PART TIME STUDENTS WILL JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGES. RELATED TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. BUT YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM PROVIDES PARTIAL TUITION COVERAGE TO CERTAIN STUDENTS AT CSU AND UC. UNDER THE VERSION OF THE PROGRAM OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA THE TOPIC PAGE SIXTEEN. MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY RESTRUCTURED TO PROVIDE YOU SEEN CSU STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THE FORMULA THE TOUGHEST SIXTEEN VERSION OF IT OUTLINES HOW THE WORD AMOUNTS TO BE DETERMINED UNDER THIS PROPOSED STRUCTURE. FOR EACH STUDENT WOULD START WITH THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THEN SUBTRACT OUT THERE AVAILABLE RESOURCES MEANING THERE OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID. EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION PROPS MODIFIED FROM THE FEDERAL AMOUNTS. BUT ALSO STUDENT CONTRIBUTION FROM PART TIME WORKER EARNINGS. THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT AXONAL CLASS SCHOLARSHIP WORK. THIS RESTRUCTURING WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM BOTH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS IT COULD SERVE AS WELL AS THE- BOARD ANNOUNCED I IN TERMS OF OVERALL STATED THAT STUDENTS AT UC AND CSU LITERACY. THERE IS ONE ADDITIONAL OPTION LISTING YOUR GENDER RELATING TO STUDENT LOAN THAT. THE CURRENT STATE LAW TAX FILERS MAY DEDUCT UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IN STUDENT LOAN INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM THEIR TAXABLE INCOME. HERE IS TO EITHER INCREASE THE MAXIMUM DEDUCTION. OR INCREASE THE INCOME CEILINGS OUT WHICH TAX FILERS CAN CLAIM THAT BOB. THE COST OF THE SENATE STAFFER COLLEGE PACKAGE IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHICH OF THESE VARIOUS OPTIONS IF IT CHOOSES TO PURSUE. BUT WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF WE THINK THAT IF THE SENATE WERE TO PURSUE ALL OF THESE OPTIONS AND ONCE AND THE PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PLAN WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. BE HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS WILL CORPORATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THE- INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS OR HE GETS AS A RESEARCH DESIGN AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOR STUDENT CENTER POLICIES. THAT PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. MY NAME IS LAURA SZABO CUBITS AND I SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS CALL CALIFORNIA FOR ABILITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND WE ARE COALITION OF CALIFORNIANS FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE TO GUESS ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE FACED SIGNIFICANT AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN GREAT PART DUE TO MINIMAL SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES. THAT MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF MOST STUDENTS TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS. THESE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FALL MOST HEAVILY ON THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS CRAFTER AVAILABLE GRANT AID MUST FIGHT ABOUT HALF OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS COVERING COLLEGE COSTS. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT RACIAL EQUITY IMPLICATIONS WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S BLACK LATIN ACTS AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE SENATE ON GOING COMMITMENT TO STRENGTHENING STATE NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID SO THAT LOW INCOME STUDENT SUCCESS IS NOT CURTAILED BY UNAFFORDABLE COSTS. BURDENSOME DEBT WHICH COULD NINETEEN HAS ONLY EXACERBATED AND APPLAUD THE BILL BACK ALL THE PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS. WELL THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT STEPS TO REFORM STATE FINANCIAL AID THE TOP PRIORITIESSHOULD BE EXTENDING AN ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT TO AT LEAST ALL STUDENTS. WITH PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND INSURING THE VALUE OF THE ACCESS TO WORK THAT HELPS COVER NON TUITION COSTS IS AT MINIMUM MAINTAINED AND TIED TO AN ENORMOUS FACTOR. THE SENATE STILL BAFFLES EACH PLAN ALIGNS TO THESE PRIORITIES IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST IT EXPANDS THE CALTRAIN ENTITLEMENT AYE REMOVING THE AGE CAP AND ONE YEAR OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL SORT OF CAPS NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS FROM RECEIVING AN AWARD. ALSO THE PROPOSAL TO REPLACE GPA WITH A GOOD STANDING REQUIREMENTS WILL HELP ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MAJOR FINANCIAL. AID PROGRAMS LIKE THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT. SECOND BMC TWO POINT NOW WE'RE CREATE STATE OF. GUARANTEE WE'RE NO STUDENT HAS TO WORK MORE THAN FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK WITH GRANTED COVERING REMAINING NEED FOR TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS. IS ALL CAN BE STRENGTHENED IN A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT WAY. GIVEN THE DEGREE TO WHICH TEAM UNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS LACK ACCESS TO SEEK FINANCIAL AID RECEIVING JUST 7% OF CAL GRANT DOLLARS DESPITE SERVING TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE'S COLLEGE STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE LOW INCOME WE URGE YOU TO INCLUDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS UNDER ANY AFFORDABILITY PLEDGE. ADDITIONALLY TO THE DEGREE THAT STATE RESOURCES ARE LIMITED WE URGE LAWMAKERS TO PRIORITIZE MEETING THE FINANCIAL AID NEEDS OF THE LOWEST IN CONCERT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THE RACIAL EQUITY IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS POPULATION. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE SENATE'S RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING RELIEF TO STUDENTS BURDENED BY DEBT. AS DISCUSSED IN TODAY'S AGENDA RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS OF COLOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE WITH THAT. BUT NO BETTER RESOURCE HERE. ENSURING THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS ARE PRIORITIZE FOR STUDENT DEBT RELIEF WILL BE CRITICAL IN CLOSING THE STATE'S EQUITY GAPS. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE BOLD STEPS OUTLINED BY THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ON GOING COMMITMENT TO MAKING COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH BOTH HOUSING. FOR THE STATE BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING BUT ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THESE GOALS AND THOSE OF THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FOR ALL YOU DO TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WILL MOVE TO A JAKE BRUNNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LAYERED AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU AGAIN- THIS MORNING- AND FOR THE FOCUS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND HER COLLEAGUES- ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES. TO BENEFIT FROM OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. AS YOU HEARD WHEN I JOIN THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY WE AT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION SHARE YOUR FOCUS AND REMOVING THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING A CAL GRANT. AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES. SINCE THAT FEBRUARY HEARING WE AT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION RELEASED AN UPDATED VERSION OF OUR CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK PROPOSAL THAT SHARES MANY KEY FEATURES AND FOCUSES WITH WHAT THE SENATE HAS OUTLINED IN THE BILL BACK BOLDLY PLAN. AS THE SENATE HAS PROPOSED THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALSO REMOVE THE OUTDATED ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS BASED ON AGE WHEN HIS STUDENTS GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. AND GPA ALL OF WHICH KEEP OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. EACH YEAR FROM ACCESSING A CALTRANS. AS SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY ALSO RECALL THE CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK ACHIEVES THIS BY ESTABLISHING A TOLERANT TO AND CAL GRANT FOR IN PLACE OF THE CURRENT SIX VARIOUS CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. THIS SIMPLIFICATION WILL MAKE STATE FINANCIAL AID MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS EASIER TO COMMUNICATE FOR COUNSELORS AND EDUCATORS. IN THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL RELEASED IN APRIL WE'VE ALIGNED THE FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CAL GRANT YOU AND THE CAL GRANT WILL WORK WITH THE NEW FEDERAL STUDENT AID SYSTEM THAT WILL BEGIN IN THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION CYCLE. OPENING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS IS THE STUDENT AID INDEX IT IS REPLACING WHAT- WE CURRENTLY USE AS THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT IN THIS UPDATED VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL. WE WOULD NOT ONLY MAKE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID THE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT AS WE EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE CONSERVE. WE MAINTAIN THE CURRENT ACCESS AWARD AMOUNTS TO BE- POINT THAT WAS JUST RAISED BY MYSELF- CUBITS. SHOULD CALIFORNIA ADOPT THE CALTRAIN EQUITY FRAMEWORK WE CAN NOT ONLY REMOVE BARRIERS TO STUDENT ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE AID. BUT ALSO A LINE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WITH THE NEW FEDERAL ONE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS I JUST MENTIONED. THIS WOULD AVOID THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FACE WHEN ASSESSING THE FINANCIAL AID THAT. THEY COULD ACCESS AND HAVING CURRENTLY TWO SEPARATE SETS OF STANDARDS TO UNDERSTAND ONE FOR FEDERAL AID ONE FOR STATE IT. IN ESTABLISHING CAL GRANT TO FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND CAL GRANT FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS WE CAN ALSO TAILOR EACH PROGRAMS REFLECT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS. ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS IS THAT THE PROPOSED CAL GRANT YOU WOULD HAVE A LATER APPLICATION DEADLINE OF SEPTEMBER SECOND. WHICH REFLECTS THE OPEN ACCESS NATURE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WOULD ALLOW THOSE LATER DECIDING STUDENTS TO STILL ACCESS FINANCIAL AID. THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN THE MARCH SECOND. FILING DEADLINE FOR CAL GRANT FOR AWARD WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW FOR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING TO OCCUR AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL AS WELL AS FOR THOSE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES TO BE EXTENDED TO STUDENTS. AS THEY CONSIDER AT WHICH INSTITUTION THEY'RE GOING TO ENROLL. THE CALTRAIN EQUITY FRAMEWORK IS THE PRODUCT OF YEARS OF DIALOGUE OF THE COMMISSION WITH STUDENTS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. I'M ALL OF WHICH CULMINATED IN THE CALTRAIN PERFORM WORKERS AT A BEEN REQUESTED BY SENATOR LEYVA pMCCARTY. AS THE SENATE CONSIDERS HOW TO MAKE FINANCIAL AID AND HIGHER EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE WE HOPE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK CAN SERVE AS A STARTING PLACE FOR THAT DISCUSSION. AND AT THE COMMISSION CAN BE A RESOURCE TO YOUR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WILL MOVE TO GABRIELA CHAVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT FUNDS. THE MORNING CHEN MEMBERS GOVERNOR LIKE CHáVEZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS- UNDERSTOOD IN THE COMMISSION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK IN A MOMENT I'M GONNA SEE IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I THOUGHT. RATHER THAN QUESTIONS I WOULD MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT HERE- WHICH IS THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MAY REVISE ITS TWO DAYS AWAY. AND AS I MENTIONED DURING THE OPENING COMMENTS THE SENATE HAS HAD. ITS OF PLAN OF FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGES AS PART OF ITS A BILL BACKED BOLDLY A BUDGET EFFORT. AND THAT THE GOVERNOR INTERESTINGLY ONE BY ONE WHETHER IT'S- WITH THE PARTS OF THE STIMULUS TO DROUGHT PACKAGE THE WILDLIFE FOR WILDFIRE PACKAGE WIDDOP THAT ALREADY. OR WHAT HE'S DOING WITH US SOME OF THE K. THROUGH TWELVE AND PRESCHOOL THINGS. HE'S TRACKING THE BOXES THAT THE SENATE HAD LAID OUT SO WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT HE CHECKS THIS BOX ON ON FRIDAY WITH WHAT HE PROPOSES. BUT I THINK THE SIGNIFICANT THING HERE IS. IS THAT THE EXISTING STUDENT AID SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE LIMITS IN PLACE. THAT JUST HELP GET TO AN EXISTING AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PROVIDE THE GRANTS AND WOULD PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF GRANTS. AND THAT WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS. IS BROADER GRANTS IN TERMS OF CAR X. BEYOND FEES BUT SECOND WORRY- TO INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED UNDER THESE WHAT I THINK ARE ARE ARTIFICIAL REALLY. OF LIMITS THAT ARE UNFORTUNATE SO THAT REENTRY STUDENTS CAN QUALIFY. ARE THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT SORT OF OUR PART OF THE FACTORS THAT LIMIT PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN DOES IT WOULD ADD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. IN A WAY THAT IT TRULY WOULD GET TO A DEBT FREE COLLEGE OR MANY PEOPLE AND IT WOULD PRIORITIZE THOSE IS ONE OF THE COMMON OR SAID. ABOUT FOUR OR AT THE LOWEST INCOMES AS WELL AS BEEFING UP THE MIDDLE CLASS OF PROGRAMS WHILE. AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EFFORT AND WE HAVE. THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE BUDGET FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES WE'RE JUST DOING TRIAGE ON EVERYTHING. THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUDGET FOR IMPACT IT ANOTHER NUMBER OF PLACES AND THIS IS ONE. THAT WOULD JUST MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN THE AFFORDABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION AND IRONICALLY WE SPOKE ABOUT. FEES AND LIMITATIONS AND CAPACITY IN THE PRIOR ITEMS I MEAN WE MAY HAVE TO REVISIT THOSE IF WE ACTUALLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT THAT'S WHAT. THIS DOES AND SO I THINK RATHER THAN ASK QUESTIONS I'M JUST GOING TO OFFER THESE COMMENTS AND THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD WATCHED SOME OF. THE WITNESSES SAID ON THE PANEL AND OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOOK AT ANY FINE TUNING IF WE HAVE TO DO IT AS WE MOVE ALONG SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. ON THE ENTIRE ITEM AND ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. NON FROM SENATOR MAN SENATOR TROUBLE. YES YOUR MICROPHONE YEAH. I'M JUST A QUICK QUESTION AND I THINK IT WAS- IT WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER TODAY BY FOR CLARIFICATION PURSES OUR PURPOSE IS MOVING FORWARD HAS THERE BEEN A COST ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE TOTAL COST TO IMPLEMENT BOTH THE SENATE PLAN FOR REDUCING AT A STATE RESIDENT INVOLVEMENT AND THE DEBT FREE COLLEGE PACKAGE WILL BE. MARMOSET DIRECTED TO A PARTICULAR ONE OF THE WITNESSES I'M GOING TO HAVE. THE FINANCE. WHOA OF THE L. A. O. HAS YOUR HAND UP LET'S SEE IF SHE HAS HER HAND UP TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OR IT WAS A RANDOM HAND UP SO- OF RECOGNIZED THE OHIO AND HOPE SHE CAN ADDRESS THE QUESTION. LISTICLE OF THE ALLEY AND- I WITH REGARDS TODAY'S STAFFING PACKAGE. ON AS- AS- AND THAT ARE PULLING A COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS PLAN IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T SEEM THAT ALL OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. WOULD BE PURSUED. IF THE SENATE WHERE TO PURSUE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN FOR EXAMPLE JUST REMOVING THE BARRIERS RELATING TO EACH IN TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR JUST EXPANDING THE COW CAN ACCESS AWARD. AND THE COST WOULD BE JUST A FRACTION OF THAT AMOUNT AND WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. TO REFINE THIS ESTIMATE. N. OR JUST OFF THE COMMON TO. THE THAT THERE'S A STRUGGLE HERE BETWEEN THE BRANCHES AND WHAT IS FUNDED AND I KNOW THAT- OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. I THINK IT WAS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION BUT WONDERFUL MENTIONED COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH WOULD BE A HEFTY COST IF THAT CAME AND THEN THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AND SOME OF THE VERSIONS AND SO. IT WILL BE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT WOULD BE MADE. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DECIDE WHAT THE COSTS WOULD BE. OKAY IDEA FOR THE QUESTIONS JUST ONE MORE AND I'M NOT SURE AB WHO DO BEST TO ANSWER THAT- SO WITH THE STATE FUNDING AND TRYING TO GET THE DEBT FREE COLLEGE. IS THERE ANY THING IN PLACE THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE KEEPING THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE- AT LOWER- AT. A LOWER PORTION. IT JUST SEEMS IF WE- IF WE ARE COMMITTING OURSELVES AS A STATE TO FULLY FIND STATE COLLEGE THEN THE COST OF TUITION AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES INTO ATTENDING COLLEGE IS THERE ANY INCENTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY REMAIN AT A CONSTANT OR OR- AFFORDABLE FOR THE LONG TERM. I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT IT IT'S BECAUSE- MMHM. THE THERE WERE THERE ARE REALLY TWO THAT MIGHT BE WITHIN OUR CONTROL F. AND THAT WOULD BE THE FEES AND THE OVERALL COST OF OUR OF THE INSTITUTION THAT RESULTS IN THE LEVEL FEES AND THEN BOXES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO BOOKS BY HOUSING AND FOOD AND OTHER THINGS ARE NOT THINGS THAT CAN. SEE A RADICALLY THE A AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE BLOWING UP HOUSING MARKET IN MY HOME REGION THE LATEST LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT CLIENT PLAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY WOULD PUT A 100% OF NEW CAMPUS GROWTH ON CAMPUS WITH CAMPUS HOUSING AND THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED BUT WAS AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM. THE UC SYSTEM FOR HOUSING IS- CHALLENGING MORE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW THE NEW HOUSING PROJECT IN AND THEN PEOPLE AREN'T BUILT FOR THE COST OF THAT PROJECT THAT JUST GOES IN AND SPREAD AMONG ALL PEOPLE. ARE AMONG ALL FACILITIES ARE IN A COMMON PAYMENT ARE LEVEL AND SO IT'S TO THE EXTENT THAT THE WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGES COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT IN WHAT THEY DO IT IN THEIR COST NOT BEING HIGHER FOR WE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT LIMITS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE COST OF BOOKS WHICH IS BEEN DISCUSSED AND ACTED UPON A DIFFERENT PLACE BUT OTHER THINGS ARE WITH I THINK A LITTLE BIT OUT OF CONTROL. I THINK DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION GREAT I THINK A CENTER MEN HAD A COMMON. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO HAVE LIKE SENATOR LEAHY CARE LAYERED I HAVE MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT HERE WE JUST SAW RECENTLY THAT. CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN POPULATION THE PAST YEAR. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CAUSES OF CALIFORNIANS- THE CLIENT POPULATION. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST OF LIVING HERE AND PART OF THAT'S ACOSTA HOUSING A PART OF THAT IS AFFECTED SO MANY STUDENTS GRADUATE. WITH UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS OF DEBT AND SO I REALLY APPLAUD THIS GENERAL THRUST TOWARDS- TRYING TO INCREASE STUDENT AID. HI MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE AND IN PARTICULAR I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS WHILE THESE EFFORTS WELL AND- THE OBVIOUS ADVICE BECAUSE I'M IN THE STATE SENATE BUT I THINK THE SENATE'S BILL BACKED BOLDLY PLANT. ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING RELATIVELY SIMPLE I KNOW THAT TOO MANY STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I JUST ARE OVERWHELMED WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT- AIDING GRANT TACTIC IS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND I THINK. THE BENEFIT WHEN WE TRY TO MAKE THESE SIMPLER EASIER TO UNDERSTAND PROGRAMS THAT AUTOMATICALLY KICK IN AND SO- I JUST WANT TO FLOOD THE ARCHITECTS OF THIS PLAN FOR THAT- AND APPLAUD YOU ALL FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO MAKE COLLEGE. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND LET ME SUBSCRIBE TO THAT AND THEN I DO CAN'T HELP BUT ADD. IN THAT IS. IT WHEN I WAS CHOOSING TO RUN FOR THE SENATE. I HAD A VERY. SELF REVEALING MOMENT WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD JUST COME OF AGE IN A UNIQUE TIME IN CALIFORNIA VERY LUCKY- YOU KNOW THE BABY BOOM AN- SO I MANAGED TO EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER WENT BACK TO COLLEGE AT THE SAME TIME AS ME. AND MY FATHER WAS WORKING AS A TEACHER I MANAGED TO GET OUT OF COLLEGE WITHOUT DEBT AND I WAS ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE AND IT'S LIKE WHAT COULD I AS A SENATOR DO. TO AFFECT THOSE EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS OF AFFORDABILITY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION WHO DO NOT FEEL A STAKE IN OUR SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S HOUSING- OR WHETHER IT'S- IT- FEES. COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT LEFT CLIMATE IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE NEXT THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WHAT CAN WE DO. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE. WHETHER PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO START MOVING TOWARD HOUSING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST MORTGAGING THEIR LIFE AWAY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I THINK. IT'S RARE THAT WE CAN MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE LIKE THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS AND THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT. SO I'M GOING TO THANK OR PANEL AND I KNOW THERE WILL BE CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS. AND THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE LEFT IS TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON ANYTHING. THAT WE MIGHT HAVE DISCUSSED ON THE FREE ITEMS TODAY AND I AM GOING TO GO FIRST. BUT TO THE ROOM THAT MORAN AND GENERALLY WE LIMIT TO A MINUTE BUT WE'LL SEE IF I HAVE TO REVISIT THAT AFTER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE LINE OR SOMETHING SO- WE'RE GOING THIS COMMITTEE ROOM WITH TWO PEOPLE THAT I CAN SEE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE.
