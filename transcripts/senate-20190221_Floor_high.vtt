foreign born in Canada is

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.961

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.252
president good morning members

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.987
SB one twenty six ensures

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.288
that charter schools comply

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.790
with the same transparency

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.625
and accountability laws all

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:53.726
of our other public schools

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.828
currently follow as you know

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.396
the governor recently called for

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:59.899
swift action to resolve ongoing

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.334
charter school transparency

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.169
issues while charter schools

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.870
are unique in many ways they

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.505
are publicly funded and yet

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.240
they lack the same transparency

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.875
and accountability requirements

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.344
the governor other publicly

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.612
funded educational institutions

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:15.614
under this bill charter school

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:16.682
governing boards will be

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.917
required to comply with the

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.986
same open meeting conflict of

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:22.355
interest and disclosure laws as

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:24.256
traditional public school boards

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:25.825
this bill will also ensure

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.126
that members of charter school

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.327
governing boards cannot use

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.396
their positions for personal or

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.498
political game for several years

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.833
the legislature has attempted

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.134
to bring clarity to this

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.737
issue fortunately our Attorney

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.171
General recently published an

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:41.007
opinion clearly stating that

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.908
yes these good government laws

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.877
do apply to charter schools

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.045
while the attorney general's

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.480
opinion provides much needed

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:49.315
clarity on whether or not these

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.716
laws apply to charter school

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.618
governing boards the pin is

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.854
not legally binding absent the

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.522
measure before you today which

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.923
codifies the attorney general's

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.725
opinion disputes will continue

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.660
to happen across the state over

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.295
how these laws actually applied

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.698
to charter schools members

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.266

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.268
our bicameral response to the

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.669
governor's call for action

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.405
this bill supported by teachers

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:13.973

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.978

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.946

and -- members aye aye rise also

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:38.631
in favor about this legislation

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:39.832
I want to thank the senator from

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.867
Chino -- her counterpart in the

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:43.269
assembly the assembly member

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.304
from Long Beach -- governor news

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.473
some -- and stakeholders who

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.041
worked hard on this issue over

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:51.210
the last a few weeks at this

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.612
is a -- an issue that center --

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:55.281
from Santa Monica and I worked

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.349
on for a number of years -- it

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:58.951
is true that -- charter schools

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.586
receive public dollars and they

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:01.620
should they should be under

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.856
obligation to provide the same

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.925
public disclosure open meeting

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.660
requirements that are other

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.195
schools that that are funded

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:11.597
by the public -- are -- must

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.466
undertake I would note a couple

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:14.867
things about this legislation

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:17.002
one is it does not provide an

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.939
exception to the rule on nine

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.108
conflict by allowing teachers

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:23.342
to participate in charter

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.443
school boards and I think

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.979
that's a healthy addition to --

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.515
governance we've done something

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.016
similar at our university system

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.351
by allowing faculty members

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.886
to serve on our governing

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:36.589
boards there but secondly --

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:39.125
that legislation has a point

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.526
of sensitivity in regard to

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.861
the charter schools that are on

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.963
tribal lands and I appreciate

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.831
the author's work to ensure that

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.068
we recognize the special status

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.603
of a of a charter school I

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.771
think there's just one on tribal

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.274
lands here in this space members

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:56.976
is been a lot of contentious

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.878
at ness and controversy

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.981
-- a lot of rhetoric

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.717
and -- I'm happy to see the

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:07.153
parties come together -- and

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:08.521
finding common ground on this

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.356
legislation I know that there

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.258
are other issues -- in this

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:14.560
space that continue to be points

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.829
of contention I appreciate

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:18.164
governor nuisance requested

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.999
the superintendent to form a

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:21.433
task force to deal with some of

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.002
the important issues regarding

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.603
-- charter schools in that

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.071
work will happen through the

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.207
course of this year it's my

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:29.575
hope that the work that we

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.043
do today the passage of this

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.212
legislation on the work that's

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.247
going to go -- on going with

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.215
the superintendent and the

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.050
governor will allow for some

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.485
level of peace to rein in our

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.787
land on these issues over the

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.323
course of the of this year --

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.591
and that this legislation is

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.293
a good start it's found common

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.028
ground it has a balance to it

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.663
and I hope that that can set

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.431
the right tone is the the author

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.465
said it during the committee

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:54.733
hearing set the right tone

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.801
after the year and I thank

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.203
her for her leadership on this

00:13:58.871 --> 00:13:59.805
thank you thank you very

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.540
continue discussion or debate

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.242
will go first to senator more

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:04.910
lock and then to senator Allen

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:05.844
center more like the floor

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:06.812
is yours Sir good morning

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.582
thank you Mister president

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.116
I'd like to address SB

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.518
one twenty six from three

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:14.153
different perspectives at

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.287
the first is I believe in

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.356
no better and no worse if a

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.757
public school district board

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.025
must follow the requirements

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:21.660
elaborated in the bill and

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:23.229
charter schools should to

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.498
to California has nine hundred

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.100
and forty four school districts

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:29.902
a third of them as of June

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.804
thirty twenty seventeen have

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.572
been manage prudently reflecting

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.574
positive net unrestricted assets

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:38.277
the others are at various stages

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.613
of fiscal distress yes

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:42.615
seen recently with LA unified

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.550
school district teacher still

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.386
feel underpaid and thus under

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.921
appreciated and they would

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:50.589
still like to have more nurses

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.992
and counselors all good

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:55.628
requests understood but where

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.162
will the funding come from

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.366
obviously prop ninety eight is

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:02.935
not cutting it to the governor

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:04.637
and the legislature reposition

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:05.804
some of the twenty one billion

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.106
dollars surplus we're talking

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.842
about in our budget maybe

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:12.344
we could provide some help

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.847
for our schools on top of

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.148
the significant cal stirs

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.516
contribution that the governor's

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.918
proposing the fed the fiscal

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:21.820
strings are showing in this week

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.355
Oakland unified school district

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.324
is ready to go on strike

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.527
so third we're complaining

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.129
about a lot of things in in my

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.964
part of the state listening to

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.666
the news ever apparently that

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.034
the fall guy seems to be charter

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.502
schools everybody's pointing

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.504
at that a special committee

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.572
and I I I would I would I think

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:41.774
you have to look past a lot of

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.942
other culprits like pensions

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.311
and in the case of LA unified

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:47.146
school district retiree medical

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.815
liabilities they just published

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:52.718
their June thirty eight eighteen

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.486
comprehensive annual financial

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.588
report and had reflect fifteen

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:58.791
billion dollars of unfunded

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.559
retiree medical that's more than

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.394
twenty four thousand dollars per

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.930
student but more is a mess you

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:06.332
would not see charter schools at

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:07.733
school districts were providing

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.668
great education for students

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.370
appearance at every income

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.340
stratum parents were telling

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:16.375
us something is wrong and

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:17.543
they're voting with their feet

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:18.444
and they're waiting in long

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.878
lines to get into a charter

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.513
school so we are seeing a

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.349
symptom a bigger bigger concerns

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.150
Mister president consequently

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:26.518
tightening the screws on charter

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.487
schools may be a misdirected

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.589
an unfair legislative solution

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.191
the legislature needs to take a

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:34.059
hard look at the facts and not

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.527
come to the wrong conclusions

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.129
governor brown even started to

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.263
charter schools and supports

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.965
them in Oakland the smart money

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.167
in LA supports charter schools

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:43.736
maybe it's time to reevaluate

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.437
maybe this legislature should

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.538
really evaluate what we're

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.673
doing the prop ninety eight

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:49.375
with pension benefits going

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:51.643
forward with retiree medical

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.545
benefit formulas and with school

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:55.047
district funding allocations

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.281
that should make establishing

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:57.349
charter schools financially

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.218
seamless and a notice to their

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.019
budgets colleagues I want to

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.154
support a bill that addresses

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.856
the deep systematic currents

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:04.990
that are hurting our school

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.526
districts SB one twenty six is

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.528
a bandaid when major surgery

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.696
is needed thank you Mister

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.031
president center were locked

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.100
we're not gonna turn the Florida

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.402
senator Allen then we'll go

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.303
to senator Jackson center own

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.805
members I want to commend the

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:20.873
authors and I wanted to do

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:21.874
the associate myself with the

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.075
comments made by this center

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:24.676
from around at your behind

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.745
so many these bills is --

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.147
oftentimes incredible amount

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.082
of staff work and I just want

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.384
to take a moment having --

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.752
worked on this issue for quite

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.487
some time to recognize the

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.989
work of two very extraordinary

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.224
staffers whose whose work

press in college I want to

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:09.254
return us back to what this

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:12.024
bill is not what it isn't --

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.392
and it's a very important bill

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:14.860
and I appreciate and know that

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.128
there's been a lot of hard work

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.463
done in this the bill's appeared

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.864
before the Senate Judiciary

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.533
Committee for a number of years

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.435
and efforts have been made to

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.970
really try to address what this

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.872
bill is all about it is about

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.341
transparency and accountability

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:31.944
so charter schools receive

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.412
enormous amount of taxpayer

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.180
dollars and their charge

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.182
with educating our children a

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:39.218
a responsible task in in a

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.620
reasonable one but there needs

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:44.156
to be sunshine in all publicly

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.390
funded schools and their

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.960
governing bodies and that is

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:50.195
what this bill calls for and I

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:51.730
am pleased that the California

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.165
Attorney General recently

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:54.566
published an opinion that was

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.668
consistent with the opinion of

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.537
our legislative counsel that our

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:01.507
state robots sunshine laws apply

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.642
to all charter schools that's

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:05.777
what this bill is about and it's

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.112
critically important because

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.114
the public is not only entitled

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.083
but they deserve to know where

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.085
our money is going and how it

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:14.953
is being spent particularly in

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.388
the pursuit of educating our

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.290
children so I am pleased that

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.459
this bill codifies once and

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.594
for all that the public records

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.230
act open meeting laws political

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.065
Reform Act and government codes

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:29.468
section ten ninety apply to

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.270
charter schools that is this

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.372
bill and with that I -- drive

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:35.607
vote for under discussion

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.476
or debate senator gorgeous

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:40.879
Mr resume idea pose a question

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:42.381
to the maker this agenda item

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.183
center Leyva we use up the

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.618
question from center board I

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.387
would love a question or just

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:49.655
please proceed thank you very

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:52.324
much -- I wanted to -- --

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.359
extend my appreciation for bring

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.928
this issue up for discussion

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:58.897
-- by -- by way of background

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.299
as an educator I do fully

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:02.067
appreciate -- the importance

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.168
of the brown act when it comes

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:05.170
to publicly funded institutions

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.772
I think it's important that

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.508
if -- if public institutions

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.742
on the traditional sense are

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.711
bound by the requirements of

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:14.646
the brown act -- so too should

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.148
charter schools in my opinion

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:18.116
so I I think that is very clear

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.851
in my opinion -- one of the

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:20.986
points brought up by one of my

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.622
colleagues is are we are we

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.958
imposing additional requirements

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.226
on charter schools by virtue of

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.028
this teleconference requirement

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:31.663
that don't that doesn't exist

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.165
with the traditional public

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.366
schools can you explain that

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.934
further I I certainly can't as

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.169
we as we talked earlier this

00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:37.970
morning when you asked me the

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:40.272
same question I said the reason

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.573
we're doing that is because

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.075
with charter schools they may

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:44.576
have locations up and down the

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.578
state in in other areas within

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.246
the school district the schools

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:49.514
are with in that district so

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.582
many school districts move

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.050
the locations and the meetings

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.552
around so that's accessible for

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.153
everyone if I have a charter

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.788
school it's here in Sacramento

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:57.623
and I have another one that's

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.291
in Chino another one that's in

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.826
San Diego in order to make it

00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.628
accessible for everyone having

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:03.862
the teleconference is a way

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.397
to let everyone participate

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.565
into in the interest of a

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.533
cost estimate for the new

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.168
teleconferencing requirements

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.536
the two way teleconferencing

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:13.939
for all of and I do not okay

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:15.540
-- were there any other --

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.575
committees that this would

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:17.843
normally be refer to that

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:20.178
were not in this instance I

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.747
have no idea why appear before

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.015
the committees that rule said

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.616
I need to appear before --

-- this is a bill that is

not fiscal at all it's only

to be better not bitter and

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.813

so age gentle man and

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:09.794

else and here's individual who

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.874
should be in the hall of fame

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.410
if it's not for his substance

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:27.111
abuse that he didn't run from

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.180
-- that prevented him from

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:30.415
going to the hall of fame a

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.817
career as soon Hertzberg stated

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.585
it was only ten years in the

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:37.088
making are two of those were

interrupted for military service

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:42.493
and once returning back from

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.296
military service he was

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.598
quite upset at the fact

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.767
that he still could not stay
