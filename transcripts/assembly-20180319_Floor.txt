SO I CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION A ONE EIGHTY THREE. A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHICANO LOCK OUT IN LOS ANGELES. FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS MONTH. THE BRAVE CHICANO MEXICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WARREN DURING SOME OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL. EDUCATIONAL CONDITION THE STATE HAS SEEN. DECADES OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT RIPE AND PREDISPOSED. TWO BIASES AND STEREOTYPING. AND STRIP STUDENTS OF THEIR BASIC DIGNITY. STUDENTS WERE FORCED. OR FORBIDDEN I'M SORRY FROM SPEAKING SPANISH BATHROOMS WERE LOCKED DURING RECESS AND LUNCH. AND STUDENTS ARE MADE TO FEEL LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEING DRAFTED INTO THE VIETNAM WAR AS SOON AS THEY WERE EIGHTEEN. SUBJECTS GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL. THE SCHOOLS WERE RUNDOWN. LACKED COLLEGE PREP COURSES AND LACK TEACHERS OF COLOR WHO UNDERSTOOD THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE STUDENT BODY. THIS LED TO SOME OF THE WORST HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES. THIS NATION HAS SEEN SOME AS HIGH AS FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. ARE AT GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL IN EAST LA. IN MANY WAYS. THE SYSTEM HAD GIVEN UP ON THESE KIDS BUT THEY HAD NOT GIVEN UP ON THEMSELVES. AIDED BY YOUNG CHICANO TEACHER NAMED SAL CASTRO. WHO LEFT US A FEW YEARS AGO? A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE KNOWN AS THE BROWN BERETS. COLLEGE STUDENTS AND HIGH SCHOOL RECRUITS. THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER. TO ORGANIZE THE WALKOUTS TWO PROTESTS THE INJUSTICE. OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND CALL ATTENTION TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR CHANGE EQUITY JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY. MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOLS AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE EAST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES WALKED OUT. TO DEMAND SMALLER CLASSES. MORE BILINGUAL COUNSELORS AND EDUCATORS AND INSTRUCTORS LESSONS ON MEXICAN AMERICAN CULTURE ART AND HISTORY WHICH WOULD NOW KNOW TO BE ETHNIC STUDIES. BUT THE WALKOUTS WERE NOT SMOOTHLY. RUN FOR EVERYONE. LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED WITH RAIDS AND ARRESTS INCLUDING ARRESTS LEE ARRESTING AND FALSELY IMPRISONING. THIRTEEN STUDENTS DURING AT THAT TIME WHICH THEIR TRIAL LATER BECAME KNOWN AS THE EAST SIDE THIRTEEN. THEY WERE EVENTUALLY RELEASED BUT THEY LEFT THEIR MARK IN HISTORY. BUT YOU GOTTA WALK OUT ALONG WITH THE CHICANO MORATORIUM AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR WERE A MAJOR DEMONSTRATION THAT MIRRORED. THE SITUATION AND ISSUES OF THAT TIME INCLUDING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THIS STUDENT LED MOVEMENT OF FIFTY YEARS AGO. LED BY STUDENTS. ORGANIZED BY STUDENTS. AND ULTIMATELY IMPACTING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ASPIRE TO TODAY. THEY DID IT FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS NO SOCIAL MEDIA. NO TWITTER. AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO ORGANIZE. I BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION TO THIS BODY TODAY TO HONOR THE HISTORY. OF THAT STUDENT LED MOVEMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE. THE CYCLES OF HISTORY INSPIRING THE GENERATIONS TODAY. THE FIGHT FOR EQUITY JUSTICE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUES. AND ORGANIZING OF OUR COMMUNITIES CONTINUES TO BE A CRITICAL PART. OF THAT FIGHT. WE HAVE SEEN TWO MILLION STUDENTS THAT WALKED OUT LAST WEEK. IN THEIR FIGHT FOR. THEIR OWN PROTECTION AT THEIR SCHOOLS AND AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHICANOS AND MEXICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE THAT'S CALIFORNIA GOES SO DOES THE NATION. THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU AND I VOTE FOR ACR ONE EIGHTY THREE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE EIGHTY THREE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TO BRINGING. OF THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT I WAS A FRESHMAN. I WAS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY. FROM LOS ANGELES. THE TOWN OF. AYE POPULATION FIVE THOUSAND. ATTENDING CATHOLIC SCHOOL. AND ALTHOUGH I. DID NOT ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES. I FACED. AS MANY STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIAN THIS NATION FACE. THE SAME LIMITATIONS. THE SAME LOW EXPECTATIONS FROM TEACHERS AND I REMEMBER. CATHOLIC PRIEST. IN MY SCHOOL WHO SAID TO MY PARENTS THAT I WASN'T COLLEGE MATERIAL. BECAUSE MY ENGLISH BEING. SPANISH SPEAKER UP WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY WHAT WAS DONE FIFTY YEARS AGO AND EAST LOS ANGELES CHANGE HISTORY. AND THE STUDENTS ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. HELP LEAD THAT. MARCH THAT WALK OUT OUT OF THE EAST LA SCHOOLS CHANGED HISTORY. AN IMPORTANT PART OF HISTORY OF THIS NATION. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO A. REMINDS IS. OFTEN. THAT HISTORY OF ONE GROUP IS THE HISTORY OF ALL OF US. AND IS CHEECH MUDDYING SAYS OF CHICANO ART IT IS AMERICAN ART SO IS THE HISTORY. OF THE CHICANO MOVEMENT AMERICAN HISTORY. SO IT IS MY HONOR TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. AND. TO USE A PROP. WITHOUT OBJECTION. I HAVE WITH ME HERE. THE BOOK BLOW OUT. BY. HISTORIAN MY AUDIO GARCIA AND SAL CASTRO. PERMISSION TO RE. WITHOUT OBJECTION. IN THE BOOK IT SAYS SO WHO IS SAU CASTRO. HIS A MAJOR FIGURE IN U. S. EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. IN US CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY. AND AND CHICANO HISTORY. HE IS A MAJOR AMERICAN LEADER AND ONE WHO DESERVES JESS RECOGNITION. HE DESERVES HIS PLACE IN THE PANTHEON. OF KEY CHICANO MOVEMENT ERA FIGURES. SUCH AS SISTER CHAVEZ. THE LOTUS WENT THAT. RUBIN SALAZAR BERT CORONA CORKY GONZALEZ AND REYES LOPEZ THEY HAD ENOUGH. SO. AS WE. HONOR. AND REMEMBER THE FIFTY YEAR WALK OUT FIFTY YEARS AGO IN LOS ANGELES. LET US REMEMBER THAT THIS STRUGGLE IS STILL IMPORTANT THAT THE HISTORYOF THIS STRUGGLE IS IMPORTANT. UP MY HONOR AND ASK YOU TO SUPPORT ACR ONE EIGHTY THREE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHABAS. YOU KNOW HEARING THE DISCUSSION TODAY. I THOUGHT I WOULD ALSO RISE UP THE GIVE A NOTHER CONTEXT TO IT. HISTORY IS COMPLEX. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. I WAS AT. A PUBLIC SCHOOL NOT A CATHOLIC SCHOOL. I TOWARDS HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE JUNIOR CLASS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. IN SIXTY EIGHT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS OLYMPIC TRIALS IN WRESTLING. AND MY TEACHERS WHO. GAVE ME THE DIRECTION AN OPPORTUNITY BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. OR SUCCESSFUL OF THE SPORTS. WE'RE NOT LATINO. THIS WAS A COMPLEX TIME AND THERE WERE AREAS POSSIBLY EVEN JUSTICE BUT THEY'RE ALSO PACES. OF JUSTICE. AND I FIND IT INTERESTING WHEN WE START USING TERMS AND LABELS SCHOOL. MY FATHER WAS A MIGRANT WORK AND YOU'VE HEARD THE START OF FOR HE WENT FOR THE FAILED TO FIGHT IN WORLD WAR TWO AFTER. PEARL HARBOR. WAS WORKING AT THE U. S. STILL MALES BUT THROUGH THE GI BILL WAS ABLE TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A JUNIOR COLLEGE AND TAKE US FROM THE. BODY ARE TO TORRANCE CALIFORNIA AT THE AGE YOUR OF UP I WAS ABOUT SIX. BUT I WAS VALUE OF EDUCATION SO THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS FOCUS ON EDUCATION BUT WHEN I FILL OUT A CARD THEY SAID. AUG. YOU'RE A MEXICAN AMERICAN AND MY FATHER WROTE ON THE CARD YOU SAID NO YOU'RE AMERICAN YOU SAID I FOUGHT. A WAR IN WORLD WAR TWO TO ENSURE THAT YOU WOULD BE. AN AMERICAN. AND I THINK IT'S IT TRUST YOU BECAUSE I ACTUALLY OF A PICTURE OF HIM WHEN HE WAS GOING OFF FROM BOOT CAMP. IN BEHIND HIM THIS PICTURE IN HIS UNIFORM WAS A FLAG OF MEXICO AND THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE GAVE HIS GRANDMOTHER. THAT'S COMPLEX BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT OUR HISTORIES ABOUT. YOU KNOW I WENT FROM I A MEXICAN AMERICAN TO AMERICAN TO CHICANO. TO WILL A LATINO TO HISPANIC AND ICE JOKE AROUND YOU KNOW AT NO TIME DID I EVER CHANGE MY NAME WHO I WAS WHO I THOUGHT I WAS. BUT PEOPLE STARTED TELLING ME WHO I WAS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY LIFE. IS THERE A JUSTICE IN THE WORLD YES THERE IS INJUSTICE GOING ON RIGHT NOW TODAY PROBABLY NOT ONLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I SUGGEST YOU AROUND THE WORLD. BUT WE SHOULD NOT. PAINT STATE A CALIFORNIA AS ONE THAT HAD THIS BIG TURMOIL AT THE TIME BECAUSE THERE WERE LITTLE GUYS LIKE ME NAME CHAVEZ. WHO WAS GIVEN ALL THE OPPORTUNITY THE WORLD? BECAUSE OF A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT ONE HAS SPENT. YOU KNOW I JUST ASK YOUR BUDDY PUT IT IN CONTEXT WHAT'S GOING ON AYE I'M HERE THE SPEECH IS GOING OUT THERE. BUT I'M A GUY THAT ACTUALLY WAS IN NO WAY USED TO GO PARTY IN THESE DEL A BUT USED TO SIR. AND MANHATTAN HERMOSA BEACH AND THE WORLD WAS MUCH MORE COMPLEX. THEN WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED. I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO WOULD YOU LIKE TO. I'M SORRY US SOME I BEG YOUR PARDON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF ACR ONE EIGHTY THREE. AND LIKE TODAY. AS WE SEE YOUNG PEOPLE. ORGANIZING THEMSELVES AND. BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES OF. GRAND IMPORTANCE FIFTYYEARS AGO CHICANO STUDENTS IN EAST LOS ANGELES WALKED OUT. OTHER SCHOOLS TO PROTEST INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY IN THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAD YOUNG CHICANOS AND CHICANOS IN MY DISTRICT. NOBODY IS A OR CHAT LIVE ROLLEI INDIA AND CENTRO. IN SOLIDARITY JOINING. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN EAST LOS ANGELES. TWO OUTCRY. THE INJUSTICES THAT WERE HAPPENING AND THE INEQUITY AS IT RELATES TO THE EDUCATION THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR. BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL EDUCATION. THEY WERE ASKING FOR THE REVISION OF TEXTBOOKS. THAT TOLD EIGHT ACCURATE STORY OF HISTORY. THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. ENSURING THAT THERE WAS DIVERSE CITY. BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEM. TEACHING THEM AND ENCOURAGING THEM. TO DO GREAT THINGS. HOWEVER COLLEAGUES FIFTY YEARS LATER. YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT STRIDES BUT WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. WE STILL HAVE NOT FULFILLED. THAT DREAM OF THOSE BRAVE YOUNG PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS IT RELATES TO ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. YOU KNOW LATINOS REPRESENT OVER HALF OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN. THE ONLY REPRESENTED TWENTY PERCENT OF THE TEACHERS. AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF ADMINISTRATORS. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LATINO STUDENTS REPRESENTED OVER SIXTY ONE PERCENT. OF DROPOUTS. WE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. I SAW. IN POOR PERFORMANCE OVER NOT BEING OF STUDENTS. WE COULD SAY. THE SYSTEM. IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR US. I LOOK FORWARD. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS. STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THERE PREVENTING OUR LATINO YOUTH FROM ACHIEVING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. I WANNA THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM THE EAGLE ROCK COMMUNITIES FOR BRINGING FORWARD TO SUPPORT RESOLUTION ALSO WANT TO THANK. YOUR GUESS WHO YOU WILL BE INTRODUCING A AFTER THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE. THEY TRULY ARE. HEROES AND SHE ROES FOR MANY YOUNG CHICANOS AND SHE GOT ME DOES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD IN THE FIFTY SIX SEVEN DISTRICT. THANK YOU SOMEWHERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AYE AYE RISE AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE. FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA FOR BRINGING FORTH ACR ONE EIGHTY THREE. YOU KNOW HISTORY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE'VESPENT TIME TOO COSTLY TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND. AND BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. AND PART OF IT IS OBVIOUSLY A PROCESS OF US. UNDERSTANDING ARE PAST THAT MAKES A STRONG. UNDERSTANDING ARE PASSIVE HOPEFULLY HELPS US TO PREVENT MAKING THE MISTAKES AGAIN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY KEEPING US ON TRACK AM SENSITIZING US OF THE VALUE WAITING WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHERE WE HAVE TO GO. AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FIFTY YEARS AGO. HOW OUR STUDENTS ROSE UP TO PROTEST? AND I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY ACTUALLY FIFTY YEARS AGO. AND I REMEMBER ALL THE PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE AND HOW HOW VALUABLE THOSE PROTESTS WORRY Y. IN CENTER RING US AS A NATION. AND MAKING US AND REMINDING US OF THE CONTINUING STRUGGLE TO WHAT TO BECOME THE MORE PERFECT UNION. THE NEVER REACH PERFECTION BUT ALWAYS WORKING TO BECOME THE MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN. AND WE MAKE MISTAKES AND WE OFTENTIMES DON'T SEE OTHERS WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US AND DON'T STRUGGLE LIKE US. AND AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT BEEN WHO MUST BRING US BACK TO WHERE WE ARE. OFTENTIMES WE HAVE LEAD THE CHALLENGE THAT'S HERE IN THE END THEY THAT THAT NIGHT IN FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY OFFER THAT CHALLENGE. AND THEY SPARKED OFTENTIMES A VOICE FOR SO MANY OTHERS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT WE FOUND THE PROTEST AT THE UNIVERSITIES AND WE FOUND BLACK STUDIES IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. AND SIXTY EIGHT THOSE PROTESTS WERE GOING ON OUR STUDENTS WERE RISING UP EVERYWHERE. AND IF YOU ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS IT WAS AN EXCITING TIME TO BE THERE. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE THE HAVE A VOICE AS A YOUNG PERSON. AND HAVE THAT VOICE HEARD AND THAT'S WHAT OUR STUDENTS ALSO DID LAST WEEK. THEY HAD A VOICE AND THEY WERE HEARD AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEARD AND THEY HAVE A VOICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THAT MANY OF US WOULD LOVE TO DO BUT ARE AFRAID TO DO WHY. BECAUSE WE HAVE MORTGAGES WE HAVE BILLS WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS IS THE ONE TIME MOST FOLKS REALIZE IN THAT LIES WHEN I WAS A STUDENT I WAS TOLD. THIS IS THE ONE TIME YOU CAN REALLY REYES HILL. YOU CAN BE THE PERSON YOU WANNA BE YOU CAN RAISE THE ISSUES AND THE OTHERS WHO ARE HESITANT WILL HEAR YOU AND THEY WILL RESPOND. SO WE ARE NOW FACED WITH FIFTY YEARS OF AN ASSESSMENT. AND WE SHOULD GO AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS IN THE PAST WE SEE THE PROGRESS BEEN MADE BUT WE ALSO KNOW AS WE LOOK AT THE CURRENT REPORTS THAT ARE OUT TODAY. THAT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. THEY JUST DID THE MAJORITY REPORT IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OF LATINOS WE HAD BLACK MINDS MATTER. IN ENDS IN AND A REPORT AND WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN THESE ISSUES AROUND EDUCATION AROUND PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT AND THIS IS A REMINDER OF THAT AND WHILE SOME OF US HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE. I WAS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH I WANTED ALL SEGREGATED SCHOOLS IN LOS ANGELES I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE TEACHERS THE MISSISSIPPI ALABAMA GEORGIA. WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BATTLE WAS ALL ABOUT? AND EDUCATED US IN THE PROJECTS TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL I WAS FORTUNATE TO DO THAT. BUT ALSO READ ABOUT FREDERICK DOUGLASS WHO REMINDED HIMSELF OF THE REST OF US BUT IF I FORGET THE OLD JERUSALEM. IF I FORGET THE BLEEDING CHILDREN OF SORROW THAT MAY MY RIGHT HAND FORGET A CUNNING AND MAY MY TONGUE CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH. WHICH MEANS THOSE OF US WHO BASICALLY BENEFIT AND MOVE FORWARD WE CANNOT FORGET THEM ONCE WE HAVE COME. AND WE HAVE COULD NOT FORGET THOSE WHO ARE STILL LEFT BEHIND AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN THIS HOUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE HAVE IS OUR OWN BENEFITS. THE CONSULATE RAISE A VOICE SOME I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD TO REMIND US OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN. A FEW STEPS WE MAY FORWARD BUT ALSO NEVER GO BACK AND TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I HOPE THE ALL OF US WILL BOTH FOR THIS ACR BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A RECOGNITION OF OUR HISTORY.
