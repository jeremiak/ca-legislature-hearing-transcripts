PRISON SYSTEM SO YOU HAVE

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.884

IS NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IT

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:51.432
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IN THE

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.134
BIGGER ISSUE TO BE SET ON THIS

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:55.436
IS. I GUESS. WE DO SO MUCH FOR

01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:57.038
ADULTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR KIDS

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:57.972
TO STOP THE SCHOOL TO PRISON

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:00.074
PIPELINE IT IS THERE IS REAL.

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.810
BUT WE REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN SAN

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.245
FRANCISCO LA SACRAMENTAL. WHAT

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.347
WE DON'T FAR WORSE COMMUNITIES

FIFTY YEARS ARE STILL THE SAME

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:22.697
FOCUS ON THAT. BUT DON'T GIVE

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:23.665
GAINES A BREAK. THE A LOT OF

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.366

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.701
SUFFERING. AND THAT'S WITH THE

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:27.969
BIG ISSUE FOR WHAT A FIX IN

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.470
TARGET BUT LIKE I SAID THE

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.205
STAPLE OF THAT IS DOING. THE

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.573
ROBBERIES AND BURGLARIES IN

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.575
THIS CHANGES THAT AND THAT'S

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:35.710
WHERE THE BIG THING IS COMING

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:37.145
FROM SOMEONE NOT A POLITICIAN

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.479
THAT'S THE ONE THAT DID IT FOR

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:40.481
THIRTY YEARS. AND SPENT TN

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.417
YEARS IN THE GANG UNIT. AND IT

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.152
HAPPENS ON A DAILY BASIS SO WE

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.688
GOT TO FIX THIS BUT- LOSING A

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.656

ARE OFTEN USED FOR LESLIE

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:44.585
WILLIAMS EARLY AND

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.320
DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:46.954
PEOPLE OF COLOR THE RESULT IN

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.656
SYSTEMIC FINALIZATION OF

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.024
CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.726
HOWEVER THIS CHANGE IS NOT

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:52.693
SOMETHING THAT'S BEING TAKEN

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.528
LIGHTLY. THAT ACTUALLY WAS A

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:56.530
POLICY RECOMMENDATION PROVIDED

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:58.299
IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:00.234
THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:01.936
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:04.372
ENERGY WITH EXPERTS SEEING WHAT

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:06.173
ARE THE WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.708
ARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.110
BUT OF NOT ONLY LEAD TO MASS

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.978
INCARCERATION BUT

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.847
DISPROPORTIONATE INCARCERATION.

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:14.148
SO THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:15.416
MAKE THE APPLICATION AGAIN

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.984
HASN'T IMPOSSIBLE RATHER

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.619

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:21.222
PROVIDED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:21.756
THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:25.593
ACTUALLY. COMMITTED ON BEHALF

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:26.627
OF THE GAME. SO THIS IS NOT

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.262
LOSE LAWS IS ACTUALLY

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.563
INCREASING THE DUE PROCESS

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:32.199
PROTECTIONS IN COURT. SO DON'T

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:35.436
BELIEVE THE FEAR MONGERING WHEN

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.104

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:40.107
INCLUDED IN FACT THE CDA THE

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.809
DISK ATTORNEYS WHO OPPOSED THE

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:42.910

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:56.791
NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT ONE IS A

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:57.725

ENHANCEMENT ADDED. ONTO AN EDG.

IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THE

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:25.286
