BRIAN RAN WITH LA -- AT NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE ADDITION TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT'S AN EXPANDED EFFORT BY THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE -- TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ENHANCE FIRE PROTECTION. OKAY CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK TO THE THE DAIS -- SENATE MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO APPRECIATE. HOW FIRED FROM THE FINANCING IN FORD THIS ISSUE ON NUMBER FOUR ELECTED THEIR SPEAK SPECIFICALLY AND ONE ISSUE IN REGARDS? TO THE THIRTEEN FIRE ENGINES UNDER ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR I'M WHERE. I THINK MANY OF OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IN TAKING A LOOK AT THE FATIGUE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WITHIN THE RANKS OF CALIFORNIA. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS CHALLENGE AND I SAY IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THIS DEPARTMENT HAS EVER FACED IN ITS HISTORY. THE FATIGUE THAT BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE GOING IN. WHEN ALL ARE COMING OUT? AND WHILE I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR ADVANCING THIRTEEN FIRE ENGINES -- IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. THE STATE IS STILL UNDER THE PEAK OF IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE OR THIRTY ONE ENGINE SHORT OF WHERE WE WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IN THE STATE -- SO WHERE. WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO IS A COMMITMENT? TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT'S GOING TO BE THIRTEEN THIS YEAR. THIRTEEN NEXT HI AND THEN I AFTER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR TO BE ABLE TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE. WHO ARE? AT FIFTEEN YOU HEAR IN THE RANKS WITHIN THE DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA EACH AND EVERY DAY. HOW LONG THEY'RE GONE? HOW IT'S IMPACTING THEMSELVES AND IMPACT IN THE FAMILY? SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER THE NEXT. THIRTY SIX MONTHS IS CONTINUE TO ADD THOSE THIRTEEN ENGINES THIS YEAR. NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER I TO BE ABLE TO GET US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN NINETEEN FLIPPIN SEVENTY FIVE BEFORE I WAS BORN. SO I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I HAVE NO COMMENT WHERE I WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SENATOR MINING. IF YOU CAN REMEMBER YOU WEREN'T THERE. I JUS WANT TO ADD ON TO THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR MCGUIRE. I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. I ALSO SHARE THE CONCERN. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT? STAFFING AND WHEN WE LOOK DOWN TO THE EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER THE NEW ABNORMAL AS GOVERNOR BROWN -- DESCRIBED IT OF EXTENDED FIRE SEASONS EXTENDED WEATHER EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. IN TE RISK THAT WERE PUTTING FIREFIGHTERS. AT ON THE FRONT LINES. THAT'S WHAT'S PROMPTED ADDING THE EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PEACE. UNDERSTANDING THAT MORE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE DIED FROM SUICIDE THAN ON THE FRONTLINE OF FIRES THERE'S A TRAUMA NOT DISSIMILAR FROM. BEING AT WAR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WORK. SO WHEN WE TRANSLATE. ENGINES THIRTEEN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. REDUCE STRESS FOR ALL FIREFIGHTERS BY INCREASING NOT JUST TRUCKS. BUT STAFFING ON THE FIRE LINE SO. I WANT TO JUST JOIN WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE AND EXPRESSING MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE NEXT. TWO YEARS BEYOND THIS BUDGET YEAR. FOR THIS CONTINUED ENHANCEMENT OF NOT JUST TENSIONS BUT OF HUMAN RESOURCES. WORKING WITH THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THE FRONT LINES IN A APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THAT CENTER JONES. THE CHAIRMAN AND I JUST WANT TO VOICE MY MORE ON THAT AS WELL. AND NOT LOOK FOR TO BEING BACK HERE NEXT YEAR AND ADVOCATING FOR MORE FIRE ENGINES AND STAFFING AS WELL AS MOST FOLKS REALIZE THAT MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE HIGH FIRE ZONES AS WELL -- HAVING ONE OF THE TO WORST FIRES TWO THOUSAND THREE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ARE. THERE IS STILL A GREAT RISK AND WHEN MY FIREFIGHTERS TRAVELED THE REST OF THE STATE. FOR A EIGHT OTHER TALENTS SOME THE FARTHEST DISTRICT DISTANCES AND HOME AWAY FROM HOME THE MOST AND I I THINK THAT THIS GOES. TO HELPING. FIRST OF ALL PROTECT A DEFENDANT AND THEN HELPING OUR FIREFIGHTERS RETURN HOME SOONER. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTER STERN. I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH. MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND JUST. MAKE ONE NOTE WE'VE BEEN BEATING HIS DRUM I THINK ALL YEAR TALK WITH LA -- ABOUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT SIZING THE SCOPE OF OUR RESILIENCY BUDGET OVERALL WHETHER IT'S ON THE SUPPRESSION SIDE ON PREVENTION SIDE LOOKING IN MITIGATION. I THINK WE NEED OVERALL A RESET ABOUT. WHAT IS A LOT OF IT WHAT'S A LOT AND WHAT ISN'T AND I FRANKLY THINK ALL THIS IS UNDERSIZED THE FACT THEY WERE FORCED TO TO SORT OF FIGHT IN THESE? NARROW POTS FOR FUNDING WHEN THIS IS THE BIGGEST CRISIS STATE BUSINESS DATA CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGES HERE. NOT GOING ANYWHERE TO ACTUALLY GOING TO GET WORSE SO -- FULLY SUPPORT THAT BUT JUST IN THIS BROADER CONTEXT IS AS WE GO THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION FUND WE LOOK AT OUR PRICE OF CARBON AND WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW IN THIS STATE WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON SEXY HALF OF WHAT. THE TRUE COST OF CARBON IS AND MORE BROADLY ABOUT OUR STRATEGIES AND RESILIENCY FUNNY I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO LIFT. ALL ENGINES AND THE REST OF IT AT THE SAME TIME BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT ANALYSIS SO. JUST. AS THERE BEEN ANY FURTHER THINKING IN AT A DEAL WHERE FOR AT IT AND ELLIE -- OR EVEN I KNOW WE HAVE -- P. R. HERE TODAY AS WELL. WHAT THE SORT OF HOW TO HAVE A PROPER NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND WHETHER WERE ACTUALLY UNDER SHOOTING ALL OF THIS? STEPHEN BENSON DEPARTMENT FINDS LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IN A PREVIOUS HEARING. HOW FIRE IS AS A KIND OF A? SPIN OFF BUT IT IS A PART OF THE THE STRATEGIC PLAN THEY FINISH THEIR GOING TO BE STARTING TO WORK ON KIND OF THE LARGER. ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL STATEWIDE NEED MORE THAN MAYBE GAPS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO TO TRY AND GET TO THIS KIND OF RIGHT SIZING CONCEPT -- I THINK. CAN BUILDING OFTEN COMMENT YOU MADE TO ME IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUDGET WAS THAT OF RESILIENCY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN WE DO ONGOING INVESTMENTS WERE KIND OF KEEPING IN LINE WITH WHAT THE ON GOING REVENUE LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS INVEST? IN A BUNCH OF THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES AND THEN FIND OUT ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS OUT OF THE BUDGET. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AGAIN. I THINK YOU WELL I CAN'T COMMENT TO WHAT THE MINISTRATION WE PROPOSING OVER THE NEXT TO YOU KNOW BUDGET. CYCLES I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS CONVERSATIONS NOT GOING AWAY -- THIS ISSUES NOT REALLY GOING AWAY AND SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE. TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT A TRACKING IT IS THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT STUFF IS DEVELOPING COMES OUT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO US IN FIGURING OUT WHERE TO INVEST. THIS PROPOSAL WAS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO SAY WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK OF MAINTAINING BUDGET RESILIENCY WHAT KIND OF A COLLECTION OF INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE IN SOME NEEDED AREAS AND SO. ALL THAT AVIATION WAS IMPORTANT WE FELT THAT INVESTING IN THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF THE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS. WE'RE THE VERY IMPORTANT ENGINES IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT STEP. THERE'S JUST A WHOLE LOT OF AREAS WHERE THIS IS SUPER CRITICAL AND TRYING TO KEEP WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK RESILIENCY. WE TRY TO DO A BALLOT -- AND THAT WAS REALLY A FRAMEWORK AND I AGAIN LIKE I SAID I I DON'T EXPECT THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING ANYWHERE WORK AND HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT IN HERE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST ASK IS AS CAL FIRE GOES THROUGH ITS TEACHING THREE THINKING TO MAKE IT INTEGRATIVE. THINK ABOUT HOW TO UTILIZE THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO LEAN ON THE RESOURCES AGENCY RIGHT TO LOOK AT SORT OF OTHER AGENCIES WITH. THE SORT OF BROADER STAKE IN. AND NOT JUST THE BUDGET RESILIENCY BUT THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL CLIMATE RESILIENCY THE STATE AND TRY TO GET SOME STRATEGIC THINKING BECAUSE WE MAY ACCEPT TO THINK OF NEW IDEAS THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL HERE TODAY -- TO IF I COULD JUST BILLING OF THAT THOUGHT AGAIN ANY WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT THE INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENTS RENDON THINGS THEY WERE TRYING TO DO SOME THINGS WHERE IT'S LIKE LET'S FIND SOME NEW IDEAS I THINK CERTAINLY. TYING IN ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS AND EXPERTISE OF THOSE AREAS IS REALLY A PART OF THAT BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. FINALLY SALUTE. THANK YOU AND I WILL -- I JOIN THE CHOIR I WILL -- I'VE ASSURE THE MEMBERS THAT THE INCREASE IN ADDITIONAL FIRE ENGINES IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR CALIFORNICA TOMAHAWKS AND IS C. ONE THIRTIES AND THAT. I WILL BE MEETING WITH -- DIRECTOR PORTER AFTER WE GET THROUGH THIS BUDGET TO TO FIND OUT WHAT THE WHAT THE NEXT THREE YEAR PLAN IS FROM CAL FIRE ON PROVIDING THESE SAID. THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL -- FIRE ENGINE SAID SEND REQUIRE HAS SO ELOQUENTLY TALKED ABOUT. WITH THAT. WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. AND TO BE RETURNED FOR THAT THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. SEVEN UP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI. GAINES [inaudible] PLAN [inaudible] MONEY. OKAY LET'S MOVE -- TO OUR DISCUSSION ISSUES ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN GREENHOUSE GASES -- PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. A SHE WEARS MY SHEET -- THAT. IS A REVISED GREENHOUSE GAS -- MATTER FOR EXPENDITURE. AS I INDICATED EARLIER WE EXPECT THE OPTION TO INCREASE THE TIME. SALES I'M I AM. AMENDING THE SENATE. OUR PROPOSAL ON CAP AND TRADE -- AS EXPLAINED IN ITEM OR PAGES. THIRTY ONE OR THIRTY AND THIRTY ONE THERE IS SOME. SEVERAL A I REQUEST THE BACKFIELD -- THE STATE RESPONSIBLE AREA WITH -- SEVEN ITEMS WE'RE GOING TO DELETE THAT PORTION AND HAVE THE BACKFIELD OF THE STATE RESPONSIBLE -- AREA JUST GO FORWARD AS IT WAS AND IN THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU SEE. ON PAGE THIRTY ONE THE TEN MILLION FOR OF WORK -- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THE TWO MILLION FOUR FIRE OUT REACH AN EXTENSION. SKIP THE NEXT TO THE TWELVE MILLION FOR BLOCK GRANTS THE FIVE MILLION -- FOR STATEWIDE -- CAPABILITY FOR OVERHEAD FIXED WING AND SATELLITE REMOTE AND FIVE MILLION. FOUR MAIN REIMBURSING THE COUNTIES THOSE MEASURES WILL BE CUT IN HALF. THE THE WHICH IS SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE THREE MILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO REIMBURSE THE COUNTIES TO TRAIN LOCAL PLANNERS AND THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION -- ONE TIME REQUIRED FOR OPR WILL REMAIN INTACT WHICH IS. SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION IN. LOW WEATHERIZATION COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT WILL BE REDUCE FROM FORTY MILLION. TO TWENTY TWO POINT. FOUR FIVE IF. MY MATH IS CORRECT. THAT WILL DO IT. AND WITH THAT. WE ARE PLEASE. THE OPEN OUR HEARING ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU CHAIR CATHY THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M I'M K&lt;c.cyan&gt; GORDON I'M THE&lt;/c&gt; DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S SENIOR ADVISER ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GOING TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. OF THE PRIORITIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON I'M GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND I SHOULD SAY AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE OUTSIDE I HAVE TO ACTUALLY LEAVE IN TEN MINUTES SO I'M GONNA DO THAT OVERVIEW MATT ALL ME FROM FINANCE WILL TAKE OVER WITH. QUESTIONS THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE HERE FROM -- MANY OF THE AFFECTED AGENCIES WHO ARE ABLE TO GIVE IN YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL DETAIL SO. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'M GLAD I COULD STAY -- TO TO GIVE THE HIGH LEVEL PRESENTATION. I'M JUST A COUPLE OF OF FRAMING REMARKS BEFORE GETTING INTO THE MEAT OF THE BUDGET THE STATE AS YOU ALL KNOW AND YOU'VE ALL BEEN A KEY PART OF THE US HAS MADE MAJOR PROGRESS ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OVER THE PAST DECADE. GILLOOLY IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WE'VE MATTER GOALS AHEAD OF TIME IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE ENVY OF MANY STATES AND COUNTRIES. HOWEVER WE ARE STILL SEEING CHALLENGES IN SOME KEY AREAS WERE EMISSIONS ARE EITHER STEADY OR GOING UP. YEAR BY YEAR THE TICKET LE LY AS WE SIGNED THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT LAST YEAR FROM AIR BE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO RISE TRANSPORTATION. COUNTING WE'RE I'D COUNTING -- REFINING EXTRACTING REFINING IS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND VMT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THOSE NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP WE'RE ALSO SEEING. STEADY STATE BUT GOING UP ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL SECTORS. AND OF COURSE INCREASE EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES. AT THE SAME TIME THE LEGISLATURE'S RIGHTLY FOCUSED IN TIME IS LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND UNDERSERVED AND DON'T VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THROUGH. MANY OF THE BILLS PASSED IN LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AB THREE NINETY EIGHT I'M REALLY WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY AND WORK FOR SOME PARTICULAR. S SIX SEVENTEEN WITHIN I COULD EQUITY FOCUS AND OF COURSE SB NINE A ONE ON FIRES HOW IMPORTANT THOSE -- THOSE OUT LEGISLATIVE PUSHES HAVE BEEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOCUSES IN ON THESE TWO THINGS ESSENTIALLY THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE MADE LESS PROGRESS. ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION AND WHERE SHE SHE POLLUTION IMPACTS MOST DIRECTLY AFFECT UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. HE PRIORITY AND IF PARTICULARLY AND THE INCREASES IN THE MAYOR VISION. WAS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD AFFECT INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY. AND REALLY GET AT THAT INTERSECTION OF CLIMATE IMPACTS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES YOU'LL ALSO SEE PARTICULARLY IN THE MAYOR VISION OF FOCUS ON THE LONGER TERM HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS TRANSITION THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKE. TO CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BUT TWENTY FORTY FIVE I SHOULD SAY AND I'M NEW TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I'VE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE COLLABORATIVE. NATURE OF THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE AGENCIES SO THIS BUDGET DOES REFLECT A COLLABORATION ACROSS. AFFECTED AGENCIES. TWENTY GOING TO THE LINE ITEMS HERE -- ON THE BUDGET AND OF COURSE I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I'LL GIVE IT A HIGH LEVEL TAKE. I'M YOU SAW OF COURSE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE COMBINED BUDGETS NOT JUST MAY AND IN THE JANUARY BUDGET ON A MAJOR FOCUS ON FOREST MANAGEMENT AND FIRE OF COURSE I'M COMING OUT OF NINE A ONE BUT ALSO JUST COMING OUT OF THE WORST FIRE SEASON THAT WE SEE IN. EVER IN CALIFORNIA IN RECORDED HISTORY. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONTINUED IN THE MAY REVISED IN FIRE. PARTICULARLY ON PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE ARE REALLY CRITICAL THOSE ARE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH MITIGATION FIRES AGAIN OR WHEN A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. BUT ALSO IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE WE KNOW THAT THE FIRES WILL BECOME MORE SEVERE AND MORE FREQUENT GOING FORWARD. AND THESE INVESTMENTS WE SEE AS A KEY PART OF A LARGER RESILIENCE STRATEGY. YOU'LL ALSO SEE. I'M IN I BE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND OF COURSE CONTINUE THROUGH ON TWO MAY I THIS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY DIRECT INVESTMENT IN. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT GOES THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS. THE MAJOR AREAS INCREASES IN MAY ON THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARE AS FOLLOWS. ONE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. BRINGING THE OVERALL PROGRAM TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION WHICH IS NEAR IT NOT QUITE AT BUT NEAR WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. THE REASON THAT WE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOCUSED IN ON THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT'S IN SOME WAYS IT'S A MICROCOSM THAT BRINGS OGETHER ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE MITIGATION AND RESILIENCE IT'S A A PROGRAM THAT IS DONE AFTER COMMUNITY. SCALE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER KEY PRIORITIES OF FOCUS ON INTEGRATING HOUSING TRANSPORTATION GREEN SPACES AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE. IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH A BOTTOM UP APPROACH SO WE HEARD IN THE AIR BE IN A LISTENING TOUR LAST YEAR. ON AYE PRIORITIES ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT PEOPLE WANTED COMMUNITY SCALE PROJECTS THEY WANTED TO DECIDE. WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT IT'S A VERY COMMUNITY SCALP PROGRAM? WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS. ACROSS THE PROJECT. IN ON EVERYONE OF THE PROJECT HAS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND OR GREEN SPACES -- INVOLVED IN THERE'S A SPECIFIC FOCUSING REDUCING THIS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED NUMBER THROUGH PROJECTS AND INCORPORATE MOBILITY OPTIONS INCLUDING WALKING BIKING AND TRANSIT. THAT IS CRITICAL AS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW YOU CAN DO THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE THINK VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO THE LARGER HOUSING AGENDA THAT THE STATE HAS HOW DO WE BUILD HOUSING. MORE SUSTAINABLY HOW DO WE DO KIND OF GROSS LOOKING FORWARD. TO TWENTY FIFTY ANOTHER BIG AREA OF INCREASE ON IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS ON IS REALLY GETS TO THIS EQUITY ISSUE BUT ALSO THE TRANSPORTATION POINT I MADE EARLIER IN A MEASURE. ON ON EMISSIONS WHICH IS DECREASING AIR POLLUTION AND V. AND EMISSIONS FROM FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WITH THE FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURAL SECTORS. SO HERE WE HAVE THREE MAJOR INCREASES ON ONE HI YOU WERE ALL OF WHICH ARE AIMED AT HELPING TRANSITION VEHICLES TO BE CLEANER AND LESS POLLUTING. ONE MAJOR ONE IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AFTER THE CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND OFFERED VEHICLE PROGRAM THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN PARTICULAR. AND CENTRAL VALLEY AROUND FREIGHT EMISSIONS. SECOND IS A SIXTY FIVE MILLION INCREASE IN ENGINE UPGRADES REPLACEMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES THAT'S RIGHT AT THAT INTERSECTION OF AGRICULTURE TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRY. IN AN AREA OF THE STATE WERE POLLUTION STAYS IN THE AIR IN LOCAL AREAS FOR MUCH LONGER AND IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND FINALLY FIFTEEN MILLION INCREASE IN THE ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION PROGRAM WHICH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT THE VEHICLE RETIREMENT AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAM SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR LARGER. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE STRATEGY. THERE ARE TWENTY SIX MILLION CARS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA TWO MILLION OF THEM ARE OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD. THOSE ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR SMOG BROUGHT THE STATE PEOPLE WITH THOSE VEHICLES ARE NOT HIGH INCOME PEOPLE THERE IS A NEED FOR PROGRAMS THAT HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION FROM. THOSE TYPES OF VEHICLES TO NEWER VEHICLES THAT ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THE PROGRAM GIVES INCREASED INCENTIVES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND REALLY GETS US ON THAT ROAD TOWARD. YOUR REMISSION IT ALSO GIVES I SHOULD SAY INCREASE INCENTIVES FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. AND A INCENTIVE FOR NOT BUYING A NEW VEHICLE AT ALL PURCHASE DISCREPANCY. THE THIRD ON AREA OF INCREASE ON THE ON THE LINE ITEMS IS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR THIS AS YOU KNOW IS A CRITICAL SECTOR TO CALIFORNIA FIFTY MILLION FIFTY BILLION SKEWS ME A YEAR TO THE ECONOMY. THE FOCUS HERE AGAIN IS ON PROGRAMS IN THIS CRITICAL AREA WHERE WE'RE SEEING. KIND OF STEADY STATE ON EMISSIONS WITH SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DECREASES BUT ALSO JUST INCREASES ON THE DIESEL SIDE AS I SAID AN INCREASE IN THAT AGRICULTURAL DIESEL PROGRAM BUT ALSO. TO INCREASES THAT ARE REALLY GET AT THE HEART OF WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE SECTOR AND FOR OUR CLMATE ONE OF THOSE IS -- INCREASE IN IN A FUNDING FOR HEALTHY SOILS WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS LONG TERM QUESTION OF HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. REMOVE CARPET FROM THE ERROR AS WELL AS A STOPPING THE ADMITTING AS MUCH OF IT -- ALSO AT TEN MILLION INCREASE IN THE METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THESE SPECIFIC ITEMS WHICH ARE ALL INCREASES IN SPECIFIC AGENCY BUDGETS THERE ARE TWO AREAS -- I'VE INCREASE THAT OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE GOVERNOR AND AND YOU SEE THESE THOUGHT ONE OF THESE IN BOTH AND BOTH JANUARY IN MAY AND ONE IS IN ADDITION IN MAY. THE FIRST IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PROVIDING WORKFORCE TRAINING AND HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT. HIGH QUALITY JOBS ACROSS EVERY OTHER AREA OF GREENHOUSE GAS FINING INVESTMENT. THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO GET TO THESE EMISSIONS WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE IN MY COLLEAGUE TIM RAINY FROM THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS HERE TO ANSWER I'M SURE WHAT WILL BE QUESTIONS ON THIS PROGRAM. WE KNOW FROM WORK THAT THE BOARD AND OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT THE MAJORITY OF JOBS CREATED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINDER IN CONSTRUCTION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF QUALIFIED WORKERS TO DO GREEN BUILDINGS BUILDING UPGRADES INC AND OPERATING MADE. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE IN HIGH QUALITY HIGH QUALITY GREEN BUILDINGS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHERE PEOPLE WE SEE A LOSS OF EMISSIONS. GAINES IT WHEN YOU PUT MONEY INTO EFFICIENCY IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD IF YOU DON'T ADEQUATELY MAINTAIN THOSE PROJECTS YOU LOSE THE GAMES. SO WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT. THE WORK FORCE OF THE CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF ACHIEVING THAT ECONOMY. YOU'LL SEE IN THE BUDGET IN INCREASED SPECIFICALLY AND MAY OR AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE WE NEED TO SEE A DIVERSIFICATION AWAY FROM AYE AYE VERY HEAVY JOB BASED IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY SO WE CALLED UP KERN COUNTY. ON BECAUSE IT'S THE NUMBER ONE BY FAR AN OIL AND GAS ON IN THE STATE. AND COUNTY IS ALREADY SEEING A DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS JOBS BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION. ALSO SEEING A DECLINE BECAUSE OF OTHER STATES HAVING A RAMP UP I'M PARTICULARLY GAS. AND ARE I'D CLIMATE POLICIES OVER THE LONG TERM AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR AS SOMETHING THAT WILL AFFECT THE INDUSTRY. SO WE PUT AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE FOR A TRANSITION STRATEGY IN THOSE AREAS OF THE STATES WHERE THERE'S HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON ONE INDUSTRY -- THAT IS A HIGH CARBON INDUSTRY IN ADDITION. YOU'LL SEE A NEW OF FOCUS IN THE MAPLE REVISE FOR ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ON HOW DO WE GET THERE HOW TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRAL. I'M AND THAT'S AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION A NEW -- ALLOCATION FOR A STUDY THAT WILL PROVIDE A ROADMAP OF HOW TO KERR TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY TWENTY FIFTY WITH A FOCUS WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE IS. ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND THE ECONOMIC FACTORS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED THAT THE AGENCIES ACROSS THE BOARD INCLUDING LABOR BE PART OF SCOPING OUT THIS STUDY. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING OUR FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND IN THE STATE TO REACH THAT CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL BUT ALSO WILL CONSIDER HOW THE STATE WILL MANAGE THAT DECLINE IN FOSSIL FUEL. SUPPLY THAT DECLINE FOSSIL FUEL JOBS AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT. ON SOME OF WHICH IS AS THAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING THROUGH AUTOMATION AND MARKET FORCES BUT WILL LIKELY BE ACCELERATED BY THE TYPES OF POLICIES. NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE PUTTING IN PLACE. SO THAT IS THE HIGH LEVEL. ANA THE GOVERNOR'S ON PROPOSED BUDGET AND I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE MANY QUESTIONS I REALLY WISH I COULD BE HERE TO ANSWER THEM BUT MY VENERABLE COLLEAGUES WHO WILL BE HERE MENTAL ME FROM FINANCE WILL BE HERE AND I KNOW THEIR PEOPLE AND AND THE ROOM FROM ALL OF THESE. AGENCIES SO I WILL. TURNING TO THEM THEY'RE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME IN ANY CASE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. LA -- DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF FOCUS MOST OF MY COMMENTS ON KIND OF THE BROADER FRAMEWORK REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND KINDA YOU KNOW THE NEW MONEY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECT IN WOULD BE AVAILABLE -- ON THE SPENDING SIDE AS WE SAID BEFORE I MEAN A LOT I THINK A LOT OF THE MAJOR DECISIONS ARE AROUND. JUST DIFFERENT PRIORITIES -- YOU KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITY PRIORITISE IS A LOT OF THE IFFERENT BENEFITS THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY BE -- POLLUTION -- ADAPTATION -- RESEARCH THOSE ARE ALL ALL KIND OF WERE THE GOALS AND NOBODY'S PROGRAMS CAN ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS IT'S A LARGE THE AMERICAN HOW TO PRIORITIZE THOSE THINGS. ON THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK IN THE REVENUE I JUST SOME HIGH LEVEL NUMBERS HERE THE ADMINISTRATION RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY PROPOSAL IS PROJECTING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE AN AUCTION REVENUE OVER THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND SO SINCE 60% OF THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THAT LEAVES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION. IN GENERAL WE ARE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PARTICULARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- AND THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE I THINK BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES AND THERE'S ARE IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- FOR THE AUCTION THAT JUST OCCURRED YESTERDAY. BASED ON KIND OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS WERE PROJECT IN -- REVENUE WOULD BE ROUGHLY -- HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING AND THAT'S ESTIMATES AND SO THAT LEAVES AGAIN WITH TAKING A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS OFF ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE. FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR OR AND SHE'S IN THE BUDGET OR IN FUTURE YEARS. THERE'S A YOUNG AS WE TALKED ABOUT. MANY TIMES BEFORE THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF WHAT REVENUE IS GOING TO BE -- ANDS FOR THE MAY AUCTION THE ONE THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO RESULTS FROM THAT OPTION ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT. WEDNESDAY -- AND SO WHEN WE GET THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE WE'LL UPDATE THE LEGISLATURE WITH WITH UPDATED REVENUE ESTIMATES. OKAY -- WE HAVE A CONTINUING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USE OF FUNDS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- FOR PROJECTS. WHERE THE PROJECTS THAT MIGHT NOT OF MEAT IS STRICT NEXUS THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER A. B.? THIRTY TWO IS IT STILL YOUR OPINION THAT THE FUNDING PROPOSAL WOULD -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY SHOULD IT HERE TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF AB THIRTY TWO BECAUSE MUCH OF THIS MUCH SOME OF THE PROJECT I OBJECTS AND I'VE COMMENTED. PUBLICLY ABOUT THE BEING STINGY ABOUT. A HEARING TO THE RULE OF LAW THAT WERE THAT WERE BOUND TO IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. I MEAN I I THINK IT'S IT'S A LEGAL QUESTION WHERE THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF WHAT IT IS YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF THE RESTRICTIONS ARE ON THE FUNDS NOW I KNOW. LET'S COUNCIL IS GONNA HAS WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND AND THINKS THAT THE FUNDS NEED TO BE SPENT ON ON A. B. THIRTY TWO RATED ACTIVITIES AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS I THINK. WITH THAT SAID THERE STILL. A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY -- SO I I THINK IN THE END OUR ADVICE TO YOU I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW TAKING THAT RISK INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN KIND OF MAKING THOSE ALLOCATIONS I DON'T THINK THERE'S SORT OF A A CLEAR ANSWER ON WHAT EXACTLY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE BUT I THINK THERE IS. SOME. SOME LEGAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SPENDING THE MONEY ON ACTIVITIES THAT DON'T DIRECTLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. VERY GOOD ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING I'M SURE WE HAVE A MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- THAT WOULD LIKE -- TO COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BUT THE CAP AND TRADE THE MAY REVISE. WE HAVE THE SENATE VERSION WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S VERSION. AND I'M SURE SEVEN THREE OVER THE ASSEMBLY HAS THEIR OWN VERSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I GUESS I GET TO GO FIRST NOT ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. AND SOME OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES -- WHILE WE THINK THERE COULD ALWAYS BE MORE FUNDING DIRECTED TO THE HEAVY DUTY PROGRAMS WE DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION -- WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE JANUARY AMOUNT BY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT BUSES CLEAN BUSES HAVE ACCESS TO I THINK IS IT'S NOT LOST ON THIS BODY WE ARE NOW UNDER A REGULATORY MANDATE BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS TO START ELECTRIC ELECTRIFYING OUR FLEETS -- IN THE COMING YEARS AND SO THIS FUNDING HELPS AGENCIES GET AN EARLY START ON THAT. ON THAT PROGRESS THANK YOU AND THE REVISED MANAGER BEFORE US REFLECTS THE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS. I CAN MORNING CLASS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE HERE TO SUPPORT THE FUNDING FOR CAL OR CYCLE AS WELL AS THE HEALTHY CELLS FUNDING. AT THE COUNTER CYCLE FUNDING WAS CUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SINCE THIS MORNING -- I I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF OF THAT PROGRAM -- BOTH FROM A GREENHOUSE GAS COT EFFECTIVENESS PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE HOW IT HELPS OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE HEALTHY SOULS PROGRAM THE FOOD RECOVERY AND FOOD BANK INFRASTRUCTURE ETCETERA -- WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS AND THE FORD WORKING WITH THE THANK YOU THANK NEXT. THE COLONEL WENT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- JUST WANT TO SUPPORT. THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION -- FOR ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION AND RECYCLING OF STRUCTURE. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IN THE UPCOMING IMPLEMENTATION THOSE REGULATIONS -- RESPECTING THAT'S COST ABOUT THREE BILLION IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO GET THE REQUIRED FACILITIES NEEDED TO MEET THOSE GOALS -- AND SO THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- IN ADDITION WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TCC ALLOCATION OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION AS WE HEARD TODAY AS WELL THAT'S GREAT PROGRAM FOR COUNTIES AND DEFINITELY SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OR THREE COMMA STRAIGHTEN OUT OF WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND -- I LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE SENATE FOR THE REVISION THAT YOU PROPOSED. THAT RESTORES FUNDING TO OUR BRING GREENING RICH FORESTRY WETLANDS AN ADAPTATION OF RESILIENCY PROGRAMS. I I THINK IN MY YOU KNOW NOT JUST MY OPINION THERE'S JUST NOTHING THE STATE CAN DO THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN PREPARING OUR COMMUNITIES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THERE IS NOW A LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE RIGHT FOR FLOODING AND HEAT THAT HASN'T. HAPPENED TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WILL.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN WERE IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT HAS TODAY WANT TO START WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIO FUELS ALLIANCE IN RECOGNITION OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR LOW CARBON PRODUCTION FUELS A WE HAVE A GROWING RENEWABLE DIESEL IN BIODIESEL INDUSTRY IN THE STATE I YET THESE MONIES OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION REALLY REALLY HELP WITH WILL NEED INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT HELP GET THOSE FUELS. FROM PRODUCTION TO ACTUAL RETAIL -- AND CONSUMPTION WHICH THEN LOWERS OUR CLIMATE ARE HELPS OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN THE STATE. AS IT RELATES TO THE THE AGRICULTURAL FUNDS.

REALLY NO OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE FORMER PROGRAM AND THE METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT CAN SHOW YOU THE METRICS. YOU CAN SHOW YOU THE RESULTS FROM THE DOLLARS INVESTED. AND SO WITH THAT BEING SAID IT KIND OF DRIVES THE QUESTION AS TO WHY WHEN IT COMES TO THE METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM WE WOULD ONLY SINGLE OUT ONE TECHNOLOGY. WE DON'T DO THAT ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THEY ARE BE WE ALLOW THEM TO GROUND. PICK THE BEST TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE BEST RESULTS WITH THOSE MONIES YET IN THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE TELLING CDFA. WE'RE GONNA TIE YOUR HANDS IN ONLY GO THROUGH AND FIND ONE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE RESULTS THAT WERE SPEAKING WITH THESE FUNDS IT WOULD SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ALLOW CFA TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS COME BACK AND SHOW YOU THE RESULTS.

ON THE ALTERNATE MINIMUM IN AND IN YOUR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THIS REALLY CAN HELP THOSE SMALLER DAIRIES. WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THOSE DIE GESTURES THROUGH THE HELP ARE GONNA BE LOS LARGER DAIRIES. IN WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS AT FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN IVESTED BY THE STATE OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. INVESTED IN PRIVATE FINDS BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT. THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN NINETY NINE MILLION INVESTED WITHIN A BOTH MANURE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THEIR DIE JESTERS. WE KNOW THAT IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. WHEN IT COMES REDUCING THAT THAT CARBON FOOTPRINT? IN WHAT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS IT WE HAVE A MANDATE ON INDUSTRY THAT. GENERATES ABOUT 8% OF OUR TOTAL FOOTPRINT. I EN DID NOW HANDICAPPING ON ONLY ALLOW ONE ON ONE AREA IN THIS MANNER MANAGEMENT SO I AND WE HAVE YOUR BOX I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE'VE. OR AT THE THIRTY FIVE BUT ON THIS PROGRAM IS ALREADY OVER PRESCRIBED -- EXCUSE ME OVERSUBSCRIBED. COMPARED TO WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE SO I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND UNDERSTAND IS GONNA NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. HERE -- AS THIS MAKES IT WAY TO THE LARGER COMMITTEE -- AGAIN I THINK THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS. WE HAVE PUT A MANDATE. UNDERSTANDABLY SO. ON TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE. THOSE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND I PRIOR TO ACTUALLY ROLLING OUT WHAT THAT REDUCTION PLANS GOING TO BE OR CUTTING BACK THE FUNDING. AND NOT PUTTING THE FLEXIBILITY AS WE TRADITIONALLY HAD OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE FIRST YEAR WE HAD FIFTY MILLION THE LAST. TWO EIGHT NINETY NINE THE STILL HAS. REAL CONCERNS -- IN REGARDS TO THAT. IN I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. GREATER DISCUSSION BUT WITHIN BUDGET SUB. THE OTHER ITEM I WILL SAY IS ALSO. HAPPENED WILL SEE THE EREKLE TO DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADE PROGRAM BACK IN THE NINETY MILLION. IS THAT IS CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL CALIFORNIA.
