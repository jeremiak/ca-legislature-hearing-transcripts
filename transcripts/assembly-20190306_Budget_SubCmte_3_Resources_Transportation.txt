OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BUDGET WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY. HI THE CHAIRMEN -- NOTED I'M THE NEWLY APPOINTED SECRETARY OF THE NATURIST OR SAYS AGENCY HI AND THIS IS MY FIRST BUDGET PROCESS OF COURSE IN THIS ROLE -- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL EASY -- AT THE AT THE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL FROM MY POINT OF VIEW WE IN CALIFORNIA -- IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES OR STE RESOURCES AGENCY -- FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ARE CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRIVING WORSENING DROUGHTS FLOODS AND WILDFIRE -- RISING SEA LEVELS ARE IMPACTING OUR COASTLINE AND THREATENING A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR GROUP OUR POPULATION GROWTH AND ECONOMIC GROWTH A VERY GOOD THING -- NONE THE LESS DEMAND A LOT OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES SO OUR CHALLENGES ARE SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR AND IN COMING YEARS. THE GOOD NEWS MY POINT OF VIEW IS WE HAVE THE LEADERS IN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. I CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT RESOURCES -- TO TAKE ON THESE CHALLENGES MOST RECENTLY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT IN JUNE WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE LAD ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREA OF WILD FIRE -- SENATE BILL NINE A ONE PASSED LAST YEAR WHICH PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AGAINST WILDFIRE THREATS. AND THEN THE GOVERNOR ON THE SAME TOPIC IN ITS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE I ISSUE TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING WILDFIRE RISKS -- FOR INVULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND THE LAST OUT I'LL SAY I FEEL REALLY FORTUNATE TO BE A CALIFORNIAN AND LIVE IN A STATE WHERE I BELIEVE ARE POPULOUS UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO PROTECT PRESERVE. UTILIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES WE CAN CONTINUE TO GROW AT THE STATE AND PROTECT ALL OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY -- THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SO SPECIAL. SO WITH ÂŸR JUST HIGHLIGHT -- A HANDFUL OF MY PRIORITIES IN OUR PRIORITIES AND I THINK WILL MANIFEST IN THE BUDGET PROPOSED BUDGET THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU AND OF COURSE THESE ARE ULTIMATELY DRIVEN BY THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND VISION -- YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED -- TO PROTECT OUR VOTE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE THREAT AND MANAGE FORESTS. I KNOW I CHAIRMAN BLOOM YOU'VE BEEN UP TO PARADISE I SINCE THAT TRAGIC OUR CAMPFIRE AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK AND I IMAGINE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE. TO WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE GROWING WILDFIRE THREATS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. NOT ONLY AND THOSE FORESTED AREAS BUT REALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST I EN INLAND. YESTERDAY CAL FIRE ARE ISSUED -- PUBLICLY RELEASED THE REPORT -- TO THE GOVERNOR THAT THE GOVERNOR I CALLED FOR IN THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER UPON TAKING OFFICE. THAT IDENTIFIES RECOMMENDED ACTIONS IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND IT STARTS TO IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE NOT ONLY AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRE RISKS BUT TRANSPORTATION INGRESS AND EGRESS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. LIKE AGE AND MOBILITY AND CAR OWNERSHIP -- AND SO -- YOU'LL SEE RESOURCE US FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES AND EXPANDING OUR OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT. SECOND PRIORITY THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE BUDGET WE'RE PROPOSING IS -- RESOURCES TO MODERNIZE OUR BOTH OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER MANAGEMENT. BOTH TO ADAPT TO A MORE VARIABLE CLIMATE AS I'VE NOTED AND MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THE THE COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURE ANOTHER ECONOMIES AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IS ABLE TO THRIVE INTO THE INTO THE NEXT CENTURY. I IN SO THESE INVESTMENTS AND WATER CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THIRD PRIORITY -- AT THE AGENCY AGAIN SHOWING UP IN OUR BUDGET IS STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR NATURAL PLACES -- WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON EXPANDING ACCESS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO OUR PARKS HI IN OUR OPEN SPACE. MOST BROADLY ONE OF MY CENTRAL PRIORITIES IS TO ORIENT ALL OF OUR NATURIST WORSE AGENCIES ARE PROGRAMS ARE POLICIES AND INVESTMENTS. AROUND BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENCE. PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY THE NATURAL PLACES FROM THESE CHANGES THAT WERE EXPERIENCING. AND THEN IN ORDER TO DO THAT REALLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN A SKILLED WORKFORCE -- THAT WERE REALLY IMPLEMENT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THEN. PART OF MY JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUR DEPARTMENTS OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO DO THIS WORK. I WOULD JUST IDENTIFY OF A JUST A FEW A COUPLE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BUDGET THAT YOU'RE DISCUSS TODAY -- AS I MENTIONED. THE RESOURCES AND FORCED HEALTH AND AND FIRE PROTECTION CAPABILITIES -- WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ON ASSETS AND PERSONNEL THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY -- IMMEDIATELY TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM FIRE REST BEFORE THE HEIGHT OF THIS COMING FIRE SEASON THIS SUMMER -- AND SO OUR STAFF WILL GET INTO THAT AND THOSE ARE RESOURCES ARE REALLY INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT THAT LEGISLATURE'S. SENATE BILL NINE A ONE WHICH AGAIN REALLY PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR MUCH OF OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT MOVING FORWARD. HILL NOTE THAT ARE BUDGET INVEST RESOURCES IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- WHICH IS -- APART DEPARTMENT WITHIN OUR AGENCY -- AND A SET OF LEADER WE ARE REALLY PROUD TO HAVE ACTUALLY VISITING OUR CAPITAL TODAY -- YOUNG PEOPLE DOING WORK ACROSS THE STATE -- IN A KNOT ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS BUT PARTICULARLY IN THIS CONTEXT ARE PROTECTING THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I IN OUR BUDGET INCLUDES -- UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND ACTS OUT OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION SIXTY FOUR GENERAL FUND AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS AT THE CORE SO. ARE VERY EXCITED -- TO INCLUDE THAT IN OUR BUDGET REQUEST AND THEN WE HAVE DIRECTOR NEMETH AND DIRECTOR BONHAM FROM DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES AND DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HERE. I RESPECTIVELY I TO SHARE MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSED BUDGETS OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS. WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL TOWARD MEETING ALL OF OUR GOALS. SO THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE DILIGENCE YOU WILL BE PROVIDING -- TO OVERSEEING OUR PROPOSED BUDGET AND I YOUR HELP ON REFINING -- THE BUDGET TO MAKE IT AS AS STRONG AND EFFECTIVE AS A CAN BE MEETING OUR SHARED GOALS PRECIADO. YOU'RE WELCOME I THINK YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR -- THROUGH -- GOT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE SAID SOME CHALLENGING BUT VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR SENATE I THINK THE PRIOR JERRY PRIORITIES ARE. A VERY IMPORTANT -- THE DEVASTATION FROM WILDFIRES -- IS NOT LIMITED TO AS WE ALL KNOW TO JUST ONE CORNER OF THE STATE -- IT IS EVERYWHERE -- ACT CAN YOU CAN -- I'M BY THE YOUNGEST OF FIVE FOUR SIBLINGS AND THE WAS THE FIRE HAPPENED AND OTHER TO THE DISTRICT IN NEAR THE CITY WHERE I LIVE. OF THE THOMAS FIRE -- WENT THROUGH -- THE AREA WHERE MY BROTHER AND SO LIVES IN AN AREABY FIRE THANK AND AT THIS POINT -- ONE OF MY BROTHERS HAS BEEN FORTUNATE AND IT'S BECAUSE HE LIVES IN A CONCENTRATED -- TO URBAN AREA BUT YOU KNOW NOT THAT YOU CAN DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM MY FAMILY BUT IT STRUCK ME -- THAT IT'S SO -- KIND OF SYMBOLIC OF JUST HOW. WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN -- HELLO -- WIDESPREAD THREAT IS AND WHY IT'S SUCH A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE STATE FOR US -- TO JUMP EVEN HIGHER THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST. A DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I THINK SHOULD HELP THANK YOU. THE PROJECT YOUR HELP SIR. IF THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY SECRETARY -- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES AND ALSO -- STE SOME ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE COM FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF AT A LATER TIME BUT ALL START BY ASKING QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE ANSWER MAKING UP WITH THE GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS GRANTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTIONS OF JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE CONTEXT TO WHERE I COME FROM ON ON TOP. SIXTY EIGHT AB FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT GIVES THE AGENCY AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY EXPAND ACCESS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACE. 5% UP 25% OF THE THE THE BOND AS I UNDERSTAND IT -- CAN BE ALLOCATED TO IMPROVING ACCESS. TO PARKS AND AND OTHER NATURAL AREAS -- AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY OUR STAFF WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE THAT. I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THEIR TOPICS OR ISSUES WE HAVE TO NAVIGATE -- WITH THIS IS TYPICALLY BOND FUNDS ARE USED FOR ONE TIME ONE TIME CAPITAL INVESTMENT. AND MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND ACCESS -- COULD BE PERCEIVED AS I'M GOING -- SO FOR EXAMPLE -- ADMINISTERING -- A SUMMER CAMP IN A PARK FOR DEVELOPING -- AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT GETS GETS OUT TO PARKS TYPICALLY THAT HASN'T BEEN A USE OF A GENERALIZATION BOND FUNDING. SO IT'S A QUESTION THAT WERE WORKING TO NAVIGATE AROUND HOW DO WE I REALLY FOLLOW THE THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF PROP. SIXTY EIGHT AND ENABLE LOCAL GROUPS AND LOCAL LEADERS TO EXPAND ACCESS -- WHILE -- ESSENTIALLY STAYING IN THE IN THE LEAGUE ASIAN BOND -- BUT IT'S A PRIORITY OF OURS IN ONE I THINK WE NEED TO DELIVER ON SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE THE BOND WAS CLEAR ON THAT. YES I AGREE -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DISTRICTS LIKE MINE WHERE THERE'S VERY FEW -- GREEN SPACES AND OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE -- DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PARKS -- AND SO FOR ME THAT'S A PRIORITY -- THAT THESE COMMUNITY ACCESS FUNDS. ARE. BEING USED YOU KNOW TO INCREASE THAT -- BUT I SHOULD MENTION WHICH WAS A WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU YOU KNOW ON ON THE APPROACH OF THE AGENCY AND APART. THANK YOU -- BUT DO ALL OF YOUR AGENCIES HAVE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. OF FOUR COMMUNITY ACCESS. LET ME MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T ANSWERING CORRECTLY IN TURN -- TO BRIAN CASH AND AND LET ME ALSO POINT OUT THAT WERE ON THAT -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM THE ALEJO COMING UP THE AS SOON AS SIR -- THE SECRETARY STEPS DOWN -- AND THEN -- WE WILL HAVE PRESENTATIONS -- AND AS OTHER ORDERED IN THE IN THE AGENDA -- FROM EACH OF THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT -- TO HEADS AND AND THE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH -- THE BRING CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE'RE WORKING WITH OLIVER DEPARTMENTS AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT NOW TO ESTABLISH LIKE THE SECRETARY WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. INVESTED IN AND STAY WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF GEO BOND LAW -- THE IN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE RECEIVED THEY HAVE RECEIVED APPROPRIATIONS IN THE IN THE LAST YEAR AND IN THIS YEAR THERE SOME PROPOSALS FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS WITHIN THEIR PROGRAM. OKAY -- AND I HAD SOME ISSUES RELATED -- TO MY DISTRICT THAT JUST -- FOR YOU KNOW FOLLOW UP -- I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON ITS PLANNED FUNDING FOR URBAN GREEN -- IN THE BUDGET -- AND THEN I'D APPRECIATE A STATUS UPDATE ON EL DORADO PARK ON THE PROCLAIM A WASH -- IT'S IN MY DISTRICT AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY NOW. AND IN REGARDS TO THE WATER BOND FOR PARKS I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHO HAS ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS. AND HOW ARE COMMUNITIES CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS FUNDING. THANK YOU SO WHAT I'LL SUGGEST IS THAT OUR TEAM PROVIDE A DETAILED -- FOLLOW UP FOR YOUR OFFICE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THE BILL WAS THE NAME OF THE PARK AGAIN -- ELDORA I'M A WATCH SO I AM -- ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. THIRTY NINE WE WILL FOLLOW UP IN A DETAIL WHEN ALMOST. UP POINTS OKAY THANK YOU YEAH MS REYES. JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE STATE PARKS AND CONSERVANCY IS. ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ON THE USE COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAMS -- A STANDALONE GOT A STANDALONE GRANT PROGRAMS BUT ARE WE WORKING WITH ANY OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE IS AS HAS ASKED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMMUNITIES I KNOW THAT INITIALLY THERE WAS A PUSH TO HAVE 5% ACROSS THE BOARD AND THEN THE LANGUAGE IS CHANGED TO UP 25%. MY OTHER QUESTION IS ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE FUNDING AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS GETS OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LOTS OF COMMITTEES WHO NEED THAT COMMUNITY ACCESS AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST UP 25%. THAT ARE COMMUNITIES WHO DO HAVE THE THE THE PROBLEMSWITH THE ACCESS DO HAVE. ACCESS ACCESS TO THESE COMMITTEE AT ALL IT BRIAN ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE STATE YOU KNOW MY ANTENNA SECRETARY TO REALLY MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES -- THAT WE CAN WITHIN THE BOND TO EXPAND ACCESS. NUMB THE WAY I UNDERSTAND PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT ABOUT HOW IT WAS WRITTEN AND HOW IT WAS DISCUSSED PUBLICLY -- REALLY WAS BUILDING THE EXPECTATION OF EXPANDING ACCESS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN PARK PARKS POOR COMMUNITIES -- SO CALLED HER SUPPORT COMMUNITIES -- SO. AGAIN MY WHAT ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS TO ENSURE THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND OTHER RESOURCES ACTUALLY EXPAND THE ACCESS. AND FOR THE THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS SOME PROGRAMS HAVE STANDALONE PROGRAMS AND SOME ACTUALLY MAKE IT AN ELIGIBLE COMPONENT OF A PROJECTS THAT THEY SUBMIT. SO IF THEY HAVE A CAPITAL PROJECT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THAT -- SPECIFIC PROJECT OR OTHER PROJECTS. SO THEY ARE INCORPORATING IT WITHIN THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS. AND I WOULD JUST SAY BASED ON THAT BOB THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS INTERESTS -- PERHAPS WE COULD PROVIDE A MORE HOLISTIC EXPLANATION OF OUR APPROACH TO THE EXPANDING PUBLIC ACCESS THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE GRANT. YEAH I THINK THAT BE GREAT APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS CHAIR I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS. OUR FIRST MEETING -- HERE AND PERHAPS ARE GOING. THE VERY FIRST ITEM THAT'S LISTED -- IS STATE PARKS AND TALKS ABOUT SICK NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS. FOR OUR COMMUNITY USE WHO ARE PARK. FOR THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND WE SHOWED BUDGET IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOING FROM TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. DOWN TO TWO MILLION. IS THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED LATER IN TODAY'S HEARING VERY SPECIFICALLY YES AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS THERE IS A WE DO HAVE REGULAR RELEVANT FROM STATE PARKS HERE THAT. WOULD BE AVAILABLE AS OF RIGHT CONCERNED [inaudible] OKAY. GREAT -- SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRESENTATION NOW FROM THE LA -- ABOUT -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO SERGEANT HAS PASSED AROUND A HANDOUT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AND AND WHERE WE STAND WITH IT -- FOR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I THINK YOU DO HAVE AN AUDIENCE FULL OF DEPARTMENT MEMBERS WHO HOPEFULLY CAN. ANSWER SOME OF THOSE DEEP DIVE QUESTIONS THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER -- IN THIS HANDOUT IS ONLINE FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MENTION SOMETHING THE THIS BEING THE OF BUDGET OVERSIGHT. COMMITTEE -- FOR OVER TRANSPORTATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES -- I THINK WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO BE COGNIZANT ABOUT HOW MUCH PAPER -- GETS USED TAP IT'S ONLY ONE LITTLE THING -- JUST IMPRINTING THE AGENDAS HERE I'D LIKE TO OVERTIME DECREASE. OUT WILL ALWAYS HAVE PAPER COPIES AVAILABLE BUT RIGHT NOW THE STACK IS ABOUT THAT HIGH FOR TODAY'S AGENDA AND IF WE COULD SLOWLY MOVE THAT NUMBER DOWN. THE AGENDA IS ON THAT'S MY WAY OF SAYING THAT THE AGENDA IS AVAILABLE ONLINE. AND TO THE EXTENT WE CAN ACCESS THE THAT MORE TO HELP THE I CAN ARE AN OUR WEBSITE AS WELL AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T REMEMBER TO SAY THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PRESENTATION SO WE'LL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOCKS. I'M SAID TURNING TO PAGE ONE HERE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WAS A BOND PLACED ON THE BALLOT BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH SB FIVE AND APPROVED BY VOTERS IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IT DOES HAVE SEVERAL OVER SEVENTY FIVE DISCRETE CATEGORIES OF SPECIFIC WAYS THE FUNDING NEEDS TO BE USED TYPICALLY IT'S NOT FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS THERE ARE A FEW BUT MOSTLY IT'S CATEGORIES OF TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE DIRECTED. MOST OF THE FUNDING IS TO BE ALLOCATED THROUGH -- COMPETITIVE GRANTS ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY BUT BUT MOST OF THEM -- THERE ARE M. CLAUSES WITHIN THE BONDS THAT STRIKES FUNDING AND HAS A SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEFINED WITHIN THE BOND. FOR EXAMPLE CERTAIN PROPORTION OF FUNDING AT LEAST 15% FOR EACH CATEGORY NEEDS TO BE USED FOR SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND IF THERE ARE LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME OF THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE TYPICALLY WAVED FOR THESE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES. HI EVEN THOUGH JUST PASSED IN LAST JUNE THERE WAS OVER A ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN THIS CURRENT YEAR BUDGET THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO GET UP AND RUNNING WITH THE BOND. MOSTLY FOR EXISTING PROGRAM SO THAT THEY WERE READY TO GET UP AND AND GOING OR SOME SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR STATE AGENCIES TO TO GET READY. TO MOVE FORWARD IN FUTURE YEARS -- AND THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES THAT PROPOSES PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS FOR THIS COMING YEAR SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT THIS PROVIDES YOU A SUMMARY. ARE THERE SOME CONSOLIDATION HERE WE DIDN'T PUT ALL SEVENTY FIVE CATEGORIES BUT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF THE BOND. THE IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENT HOW MUCH THE BOND IN THE FINAL CALL PROPOSED IN ABOUT FOR YOU THIS YEAR -- YOU CAN SEE. THERE ARE SOME CATEGORIES THAT HAVE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND PROPOSED FOR THE COMING YEAR AND THAT'S USUALLY BECAUSE THEY GOT A BIG PLOP OF MANY IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- EITHER THE FOOD RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE FULL AMOUNT OR A LARGE AMOUNT AND THAT STILL IN PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED. I WILL DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A FEW OF THE LARGE CATEGORIES IN THAT FINAL CAT I'M. CALLING HIM THAT. ARE PROPOSED TO BE RELATIVELY NEW THE THIRD WENT DOWN FOR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH I THINK YOU'VE GOT FOLKS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE READY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY -- DOWN AT THE BOTTOM IN THE WATER CATEGORY QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING FOR FLOOD PROJECTS. FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT FOR THAT GROUND WATER LAST YEAR THERE WAS FUNDING PROVIDED FOR PLANNING BUT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THERE'S A LARGE AMOUNT FOR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS -- TO START DOING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT -- AND AND YOU CAN SEE THE STORM WATER BY A PROGRAM MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER MOST OF THE FUNDING PROPOSED. FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR SO ASSUMING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ARE ALL ADOPTED THAT WOULD LEAVE ABOUT HALF OF THE BOND FOR FUTURE YEARS -- SOME SURE YOU'VE GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON THIS. UP EITHER FOR ME OR FOR THE DEPARTMENTS BUT ALL MOVE QUICKLY HERE TO THE PAGE THREE OF OUR OVER ARCHING COMMENTS SINCE THIS IS JUST THE OVERVIEW -- IN OUR INITIAL REVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SEEM CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE AND VOTER AT TEN WE DON'T SEE ANYTHING KIND OF CRAZY. GOING ON HERE IN THE PROPOSALS -- BUT WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR THE BUDGET YOU'RE WERE PRESENTED IN ONE PACKAGE I'M BY THE GOVERNOR ONE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ARE BCP TECHNICAL BUDGET DOCUMENT WITHOUT -- ANY DETAIL OVER THOSE AM DISCREET PROGRAMS AND SO FOR PROGRAMS THAT EITHER HAD PROPOSALS LAST YEAR WITH A LOT OF DETAIL ARE CONTINUING OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT'S LESS OF A CONCERN. BUT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS IN HERE THAT ARE BRAND VERY FIRST TIME AND WE THINK THAT YOU YOU AND YOUR STAFF NEED. AT A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL ABOUT HOW ARE THOSE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IF THERE ARE NEW STAFF PROPOSED WHAT ARE THOSE STAFF GOING INTO HOW WILL THE FUNDING GO OUT SO THAT LACK OF DETAIL HAS BEEN CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR CREDIT HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS -- BUT OF COURSE THAT INFORMATION ISN'T PUBLIC WHEN WE HAVE BACK AND FORTH TO THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE TO HANDLE THESE THINGS AND IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I THINK IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THAT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE NEW PROGRAMS IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. TO FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD WITH THOSE -- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS I THINK ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF YOUR DENT ABOUT SOME OF THOSE NEW PROGRAMS I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MOVE TO NEXT THAT ARE BRAND NEW. SO WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY REASONABLE GREAT STARTING PLACE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU MOVE FOURTH COLLECTING INFORMATION BOTH FROM STAKEHOLDERS. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAISES POINT IF THERE ARE -- PARKS OUT THERE THAT ARE READY TO APPLY FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS THEN MAYBE WE WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR FOR ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF GRANTS TO GO OUT -- I MY PRESUMPTION AND YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT IS THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A LARGE A PREPARATION LESTER THEY MAY BE KIND OF WAITING AND LETTING THAT PERCOLATE DOWN THIS YEAR. BEFORE PROPOSING ANOTHER PREPARATION BUT MAYBE THERE'S DEMAND NOW SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS -- THERE MAY ALSO BE KIND OF A BACKLOG OF FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS BONDS FOR SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES THAT ARE. KIND OF TAKING AWHILE TO GET OUT THE DOOR AND MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED PROP SIXTY EIGHT YET SO WE THINK THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU'D WANNA. TALK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENTS TO FIND OUT -- WHETHER THIS PACKAGE THERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR THE THE OVERVIEW. OF UP -- PROP [inaudible] SIXTY EIGHT FOR OKAY. AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE -- PRESENTATION OF THE ACTUAL -- ITEM. AND SO -- I WILL GO BACK AND REPEAT ALL THE THINGS THAT THE DAILY -- SAID I JUST WANT TO GET IN THERE ANYTHING THAT -- YOU DIFFER WITH NELSON. SO HONEST KEEPING TIME SHORT ON WE DO WANT TO SAY WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF THE LA -- AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MEETING SET UP WITH STAFF FINANCE IN THE ALLEY -- NEXT WEEK TO WORK ON WHAT WOULD AMOUNT OF DETAIL TO BE PUTTING IN THESE PROPOSALS IN THE FUTURE SO WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC. AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO TO MAKE THE DECISIONS GREAT THAT WE LOOK FOR TAKE TAKE THE HEARING THE BACK ON THAT. AND WE HAVE -- STAFF ASK QUESTIONS ON THREE DIFFERENT -- PROGRAMS SO IF YOU WANT WE CAN HAVE -- FOLKS COME UP AND START TALKING ABOUT THOSE I THINK THE FIRST AS VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENTS AND THAT'LL BE -- DIRECTOR CHUCK BONHAM FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE AND CARLA NEMETH. FROM -- DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES GREAT [inaudible] WELCOME BACK. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM. AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. PRETTY EXCITED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING -- PARTICULAR. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE I'M WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE DIRECTOR OF WATER RESOURCES. COLOR NAME WITH I THOUGHT FIRST WE INFORM YOU WHAT VOLUNTEER AGREEMENTS ACTUALLY MEANS. THAT MAY BE A QUESTION. AND THEN KIND OF USE THE STAFF PAGE THIRTEEN AGENDA QUESTIONS TO GO. THROUGH OUR KIND OF REPLY TO SOME OF THOSE FOUNDATIONAL ENQUIRIES. SO WHAT. DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. THE FIRST THING I'D TELL YOU IS IN MY EXPERIENCE WATER DEFINES CALIFORNIA. EITHER BECAUSE OF ITS SCARCITY OR BECAUSE OF ITS ABUNDANCE. WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF WATER SINCE BEFORE STATEHOOD. AND IT'S VERY LIKELY WILL CONTINUE ON TO THE FUTURE -- ARGUING ABOUT THIS VERY SCARCE RESOURCE. THE SECOND THING I'D TELL YOU IS. WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE MANY REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS? AND DIFFERENT ENTITIES. BETTER INVOLVED IN OUR DELEGATE WATER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. A PRIME STATE AGENCY IS OUR STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AT THE SAME TIME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR CENTRAL VALLEY AND TEN ELEVEN OR TWELVE MAJOR RIVER WATERSHEDS. IN MANY PLACES THERE ARE ACTIVE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE PACKAGES WHICH WORK BOTH FOR WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY [inaudible] HABITAT RESTORATION. AN IMPROVED IN STREET CLOTHES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO THE THIRD THING I'D SAY ABOUT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS IS. IT'S AN ONGOING EFFORT. TO BRING WATER USERS CONSERVATION COMMUNITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER. AND DESIGN A COLLABORATIVE PACKAGE. OF HABITAT RESTORATION MEASURES. IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTREAM FLOW. AS WELL AS MEASURES TO ENSURE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY. AND PRESENT THOSE TO OUR STATE WATER BOARD. AS A COLLECTIVE COALITION EFFORT. LITERALLY FROM ABOUT READING ALMOST ON THE FRESNO ACROSS A HALF A DOZEN MAJOR RIVERS. AND THEN FACILITATE OUR STATE WATER BOARD. ENGAGING IN ANALYZING THE LEGAL AND SCIENTIFIC SUFFICIENCY. FOR THOSE PLANS TO IMPROVE OUR WATER QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP. TO IT'S NOT EASY. AND THAT'S THE SEGUE TO THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU SEE PROPOSE -- FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE. DR NAME IF YOU WANNA TAKE US THROUGH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS MAY BE SPENT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS CARLA NAME IF I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- AND I'M I'M GLAD TO BE HERE ON MAYBE OUR THIRD OR FOURTH A STORM INTENT STORM COMING THROUGH THE AREA THAT'S A GREAT SIGN -- FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- THAT WAS A A TERRIFIC INTRODUCTION BY A DIRECTOR BONHAM INTO THE THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ON THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. AND OF THE OUTCOMES WERE WERE SEEKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- I WOULD ALSO ADD AND EMPHASIZE THAT THE AGREEMENTS THEMSELVES ARE ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS -- AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DO THAT WILL ENABLE US TO DEFINE A COMPLETE PACKAGE TO BRING BEFORE THE WATER BOARD. IN TERMS OF TIMING OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT -- WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE WATER BOARD AND WORK WITH THEM TO SUPPORT THE ANALYSIS THAT THEY NEED TO DO. UNDER THEIR AUTHORITIES AND COMPLETE A SECRET DOCUMENT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- IN TERMS OF FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED -- ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND HOW THOSE DECISIONS WOULD BE MADE ABOUT WHICH PROJECTS TO SUPPORT. IS A A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE A WE HAVE A PROPOSED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN THE PROPOSED VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDES -- THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THE IN STREAM OR INDIVIDUAL TRIBUTARY COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDER WAY AS WELL AS A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS. IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY INCLUDE MEMBERS FROM MY DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE WATER BOARD BUT EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT MEMBERS IN THE AND WATER USER COMMUNITY. AND THOSE PARTIES -- IN IMPLEMENTING THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WOULD GO THROUGH IT AND ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS -- TO DETERMINE AVAILABLE FUNDS -- BOTH FROM PUBLIC SOURCES AND WATER USER SOURCES AND THE SWEET OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN FURTHERANCE OF THE OUTCOMES. OF ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS -- WE ARE LOOKING AT HAS THE AS DIRECTOR BONTA MENTIONED. WE HAVE -- FLOAT THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVED FLOWS IN ALL THE INDIVIDUAL TRIBUTARIES AND IN THE DELTA. AS WELL AS A SUITE OF PHYSICAL RESTORATION PROJECTS IN THOSE TRIBUTARIES AND AND IN THE DELTA. AND THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT -- WE CALL IN OUR WATER COMMUNITY THE NO REGRETS PROJECTS PROJECTS THAT -- FOLKS HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON AND FOR IDEA OF REASONS -- SOMETIMES MOMENTUM IS IS REALLY WHAT IT TAKES TO TO PUSH PEOPLE FORWARD -- BUT THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS EXIST AND STATE IDENTIFY DOCUMENTS WE HAVE A SALMON RECOVERY PLAN AND THE SMELL OF RECOVERY PLAN. THAT ARTICULATE A RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WE WE DEEM IN THE BROADER COMMUNITY WITH SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT THAT ARE THINGS WE NEED TO BE DOING. TO HELP THE SPECIES RECOVER SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT -- WOULD BE FUNDED WE DO HAVE SPECIFIC LISTS -- THAT REALLY FRANKLY GO ON FOR PAGES OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS IN THE INDIVIDUAL WATERSHEDS BUT WE WOULD BE RELYING HEAVILY ON THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS -- MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS IN A TRANSPARENT PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. SO WITHIN PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT THE VOTERS APPROVED ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS ENDEAVOR. TO THE RESOURCES AGENCY. WHY THIS YEAR WAS THE REQUEST NOT SEVENTY ONE MILLION INSTEAD OF SIXTY NINE MILLION I THINK IN OUR BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AS TO DEPARTMENTS RUNNING RESTORATION PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE? CONTEMPLATING THE SCALE OF THE ENDEAVOR. WE MADE A BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT SEVENTY MILLION WOULD BE A USABLE ASSET. TO BEGIN INVESTING IN THE HABITAT RESTORATION. HERE'S THE SCALE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RIVERS THAT INCLUDE THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM FROM READING DOWN. THE AMERICAN RIVER. THE FEATHER RIVER. THE YUBA RIVER. THE MCCOLLUM THE RIVER. ALL OF THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AS IT MOVES FROM FRESNO -- DOWN -- THE TWELVE IN THE RIVER AND POTENTIALLY OTHER TRIBUTARIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM. SO IT'S A LARGE SCALE. WE SEE RESTORATION THINK -- CONNECTING RIVERS TO THE FLOOD PLAIN THINK ABOUT REMOVING BARRIERS TO FISH PASSAGE THINK ABOUT. MANAGING BETTER NON NATIVE FISH WHICH ARE HIGHLY IMPERILED SALMON FISH. PREDATION BY PREDATORS -- A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS HOW WOULD THESE FUNDS BE MANAGED I THINK WE WOULD FOLLOW. THE RIGOR FOUND IN OUR EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS WE WOULD OFFER OUR DEPARTMENTS AS ADVISORY TO THE RESOURCES AGENCY WHEN IT'S RECEIVING PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT IN THOSE WATERSHED SUBJECT TO THE AGREEMENTS THEMSELVES. WE WOULD USE OUR SCIENTIFIC STAFF TO HELP JUDGE THE MERITS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'RE VERY COMFORTABLE DOING. AND WE WOULD FOLLOW THE WATER CODE SECTIONS SEVEN NINE SEVEN THREE TWO AND SEVEN NINE SEVEN THREE SIX WHICH REALLY DEFINE THE QUALIFYING ACTIVITIES. THEY COULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS PART OF FOR FUNDS -- I THINK THAT'S A BROAD BRUSH -- SURVEY OF WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. AND PERHAPS WILL PAUSETHERE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT TAKE US INTO MORE DETAILS QUESTIONS -- I HAVE A QUESTION -- THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER NOW. HI YOU MIGHT WANT TO BRING BACK INFORMATION THAT JUST A SHARE WITH ME AND ANY OTHER INTERESTED MEMBERS. OF WHETHER THERE ARE ANY FUNDS THAT ARE BEING CUT -- DEDICATED TO THE RESTORATION OF MALIBU CREEK -- AND AND SO -- CHAIR MAPS ARE TO SPRING THAT ON A TICKET TO SEE I THINK I CAN ANSWER. AND I'LL OWN ANY ERROR IN MY ANSWER -- THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS SCOPE. DOESN'T RUN TO WATERS. OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE IN A TECHNICAL SENSE THE STATE WATER BOARD IS CURRENTLY UPDATING ITS WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN. WHICH IS LIMITED AND PER VIEW TO THOSE WATERS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND OF COURSE THE MALIBU CREEK WATERSHED IS NOT HOWEVER. I BELIEVE AGENCY OPERATES A RIVER PARKWAY PROGRAM. MY DEPARTMENT HAS IS YOU KNOW ENTERTAIN FUNDING IN THAT WATER SHOULD FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO WHILE IT MAY NOT BE THIS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. I'M REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ARE RUNNING THIS YEAR. WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT WATERSHED CAN SO THAT'S MY MISTAKE I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE WAITED TO ASK THIS QUESTION -- AND OF VALUE WHEN YOU MAKE -- YOUR NEXT PRESENTATION OF MYSELF LATER ON JUST WE CAN GIVE YOU A LIST OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AMOUNT OF CREEK OVERTIME RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER -- QUESTIONS. RIGHT -- THEN THAT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR TO HAVE A SIGMA. OKAY CYCLIC RATE WE HAVE -- TERRON. RAMSEY ME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS TAREN RAP IZZY ANY I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL INITIATIVES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE LEAD FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. B. S. SUBCOMMITTEE HAS PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT WITH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AND OUR REQUESTS THERE IN -- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS PROVIDE JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS IS STABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE WITHIN THAT JUST? TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR OUR REQUEST -- THIS IS STABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT WHEN IT WAS PASSED IS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA WATER LINE AND CENTURY AND THE DEPARTMENT. WITH SHARED ROLLS THROUGH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- DO TAKE ON IMPLEMENTING THIS ACT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. THE CENTRAL TENET OF THIS IS DANA GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT HOWEVER IS REALLY ABOUT KEEPING AUTHORITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHEN SIGNAL WAS PASSED IT PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT WITH DUAL ROLES A REGULATORY ROLE AND AND ASSISTANCE ROLE AND -- PROPOSITION -- SIXTY EIGHT OUR REQUEST THEY'RE IN IS TO SUPPORT BOTH OF THOSE. WHEN UNDER UNDER SIGMA LOCAL AGENCIES? THAT ARE IN HIGH AND MEDIUM PRIORITY BASINS ARE REQUIRED TO FORM GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES. AND TO DEVELOP GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. THERE ARE TWENTY ONE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS IN THE STATE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THAT HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWO TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING THOSE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. THE REMAINING HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN HI IN MEDIUM PRIORITY BASINS. I HAVE A JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. SO THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING WILL CONTINUE PASSED THE COD BASE SINCE THE MIDDLE FOR THAT SO WE COULD SUPPORT BEHIND MEDIUMS AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING. THEIR PLANS SO WEAK CONTINUE BOTH AGAIN AT A JOINT. ROLE OF OF REGULATORY EVALUATION AND ONGOING ASSISTANCE SOMETHING TO NOTE JUST WITH THE AGGRESSIVE DEADLINES BACK IN JUNE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS THE DEADLINE FOR THE FORMATION OF GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES. LOCAL ENTITIES PULL TOGETHER AND MET THAT DEADLINE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST STATE INTERVENTION DEADLINE WITHIN THOSE LOCAL BASINS -- AND THE LOCAL ENTITIES FORM TO THEIR GSA'S WITH THE COVERAGE OF OVER 98% OF THE STATE'S GROUNDWATER BASINS THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT SHOWING ON THE PART OF LOCAL ENTITIES. AND THERE'S A LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN PROVIDING UP FOR THOSE LOCAL AGENCIES TO MEET THAT DEADLINE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM IN THAT CAPACITY AS WELL. SO THAT IS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES IN INSIDE EXTENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS -- THE DEPARTMENT DID FORM THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO SERVE THE DUAL ROLES AS MENTIONED. AND OUR REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES DO INCLUDE PRIORITIZING BASINS THAT MEANS THOSE CATEGORIES SUCH AS HIGH AND MEDIUM WHICH DETERMINE WHETHER A BASIN HAS TO DEVELOP A PLAN -- WE ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED AND IS RELATED TO GROUND WATER STANDING BY WITH THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. AND ALSO BASIN BOUNDARY MODIFICATIONS WHICH IS A A PRIMARY COMPONENT -- AND THEN OF COURSE OUR ASSISTANCE -- ROLE IS COMPRISED OF PROVIDING DATA INFORMATION TOOLS AND FUNDING TO THOSE GSA'S TO HELP THEM -- AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR VERY AGGRESSIVE STATUTORY DEADLINES. RELATED TO OUR REQUESTS AND THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ASKED OF THE DEPARTMENT I WILL DO MY BEST TO SYNTHESIZE ALL OF THEM INTO A RESPONSE -- IF I DON'T TOUCH ON SOMETHING SPECIFIC. PLEASE CHIME IN AND AND LET ME KNOW AND I'LL PROVIDE THAT ANSWER -- IN NINE IN MEETING OUR REQUIREMENTS AT TO DATE THE DEPARTMENT HAS DELIVERED ALL OF ITS REGULATORY STATUTORY I'D DEADLINES -- AND DELIVERABLES -- BUT THOSE SAID DATES HAVE BEEN STAGGERED -- WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING STAFFING AND WITH THOSE EXISTING STAFFING RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE -- SO WE ARE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL. STAFFING REQUEST OF NINE POSITIONS -- THOSE NEW POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE STAFF SHORTAGE -- THAT DOES OCCUR. WHEN THE PROJECT IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS SLATED FOR CHOIR MAN SO OVER TIME WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA TO DATE? WE HAVE BEEN IN WORKING WITH THE GSA'S COME TO LEARN THAT WE CAN EXPECT OVER FORTY FIVE POTENTIALLY OVER FORTY FIVE GS PEAS BY THEN -- JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS GIVEN TWO YEARS TO EVALUATE THOSE PLANS I AND AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I IN THE MANY FORMS SUCH AS GRANT FUNDING WHICH PROPOSITION SIXTY REQUEST DOES INCLUDE -- WE WILL ALSO ANTICIPATED WE'VE BEEN LEARNING AND WORKING WITH THE GSA'S THAT HIGH MEDIUM BASINS CAN DELIVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLANS BY THEIR DEADLINE THAT MEANS. OVER -- TWO HUNDRED PLANS THAT WE WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF STAFF HAS TO REVIEW. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING UNFORTUNATELY THAT CAN BE -- AT HAND IT OVER TO CONSULTANTS THIS IS THE TYPE OF WORK BECAUSE IT'S A REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO TAKE ON SO IN WORKING WITH THE LOCALS WE ARE LEARNING MORE OF WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND THE TYPE OF HELP THAT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT ASSISTANCE GOING -- WE DON'T WANT TO PULL AWAY FROM THE ASSISTANCE FUNCTIONS WHILE WE ALSO HAVE TO DELIVER IT TO YOUR REVIEW TIME ON THESE MANY PLANS THAT ARE COMING. OUT SO WE ARE HOPING THROUGH PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING THAT WE CAN HELP -- KEEP BOTH OF THESE REALLY SIGNIFICANT DUAL ROLES ARE UP AND RUNNING AND SUCCESSFUL TO HELP THESE LOCAL AGENCIES KEEP CONTROL OF THEIR BASINS. SO -- ALONG WITH THAT THE WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS. R. G. S. P.'S WITHIN THE TWO YEAR SUBMIT ALL WE WILL ALSO BE RECEIVING ALTERNATIVE -- SKEWS ME I ANNUAL REPORTS FOR THOSE PLANS THAT COME IN WE ALSO -- WILL BE RECEIVING FIVE YEAR UPDATES TO THOSE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS -- WE WILL ALSO BE RECEIVING AND HAVING TO COLLECT IN MANAGE REPORTING FROM THOSE BASINS THAT HAVE EDUCATIONS WITHIN THEM. SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRING. LEVEL OF TRAINING FROM STAFF THAT WE NEED TO RAMP UP NOW BEFORE THOSE DEADLINES BEGAN COMING -- WITHOUT THE NINE NEW POSITIONS -- AGAIN THESE SUPPORTIVE ACTIVITIES WILL BE GREATLY IMPACTED -- AND SO WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE -- YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT REQUEST. TO MOVE ON TO A COUPLE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS -- THERE WAS A QUESTION RELATED TO THE SIX NEW POSITIONS IN Y. STOCK WORK LOAD HAS INCREASED. AND I BELIEVE I DID COVER THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER THAT HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. GSA'S HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER THEIR OWN PLAN WE HAVE TWO INTERN SIXTY SEVEN GSA'S IN THE STATE. AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DELIVER THEIR OWN GROUND WATER BUT WITHIN THE BASIN EACH BASIN IS APPROACHING HOWEVER HOW THEY WANT TO DELIVER THEIR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. SO MULTIPLE GSA'S CAN DELIVER MULTIPLE TIAS PEAS ARE PLANS FOR THAT BASIN OR THERE COULD BE ONE BASIN WITH ONE PLAN. SO AS THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THAT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE WE'RE GETTING MORE OF THE INFORMATION AS TO HOW MANY WE CAN BE EXPECTING TO THAN THAT GOES BACK TO HOW WE'RE LEARNING THERE'S RIGHT NOW KIND OF A DOUBLING. OF THE PLANS THAT WERE ANTICIPATED -- TO TOUCH ON THE EXISTING GROUNDWATER -- MANAGEMENT PLANNING GRANTS THAT WERE FUNDED IN THE CURE CURRENT IN PRIOR YEARS -- THE FIRST ROUND -- WE WERE AWARDED -- WE AWARDED SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY ONE COUNTIES WITH STRESSED BASINS IN MAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND EACH OF THOSE TWENTY ONE GRANT RECIPIENTS HAVE EITHER COMPLETED OR WILL COMPLETE. THEIR WORK THIS SPRING THE SECOND ROUND WAS -- ON A WARNING OF EIGHTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS THROUGH PROPOSITION WHEN I'M SORRY TO CLARIFY THAT -- PROPOSITION ONE WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THESE PLANNING GRANTS -- MILLION WAS SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICANTS. AND AS OVER SIXTEEN MILLION WAS PROVIDED TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- THE DEMAND FOR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS -- IS GOING TO BE VERY HIGH. HELPING THE LOCALS CREATE THE PLANNING -- AND THE TOOLS FOR PLANNING TO DELIVER THEIR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BUT THE MINUTE THOSE PLANS ARE SUBMITTED. THE GSA'S ARE REQUIRED TO IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT. THE PLANS EVEN WHILE WE AS THE DEPARTMENT ARE EVALUATING. THE ADEQUACY OF THOSE PLANS SO AT CIGNA IS REALLY -- TURNING THE TIDE TO ENSURE THAT LOCALS ARE ARE INCREASING THE MANAGEMENT AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR BASE AND SO IMMEDIATE -- IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT PROP SIXTY EIGHT IS -- OFFERING ALLOWING US FOR PURSUING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. GRANTS THAT WE WANT -- TO SUPPORT LOCALS WITH YEARS -- TO CONTINUE WITH THE PLANNING GRANTS -- BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PLANNING GRANTS OF GOING OUT TO CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS WE ARE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS. BUT THERE ARE STILL HIÃ§N MEDIUM PRIORITY BASINS WITH THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE THAT THAT DO NEED. A THAT SUPPORT AS WELL SO PROPOSITION ONE PROVIDED A CERTAIN AMOUNT WE APPRECIATE WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THAT COMPONENT AS WELL -- THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY LOCAL GRANTS WILL THE PROPOSED LEVEL OF FUNDING BE PROVIDED -- AND THAT REALLY WILL DEPEND ON THE MAXIMUM GRANT AWARD THAT IS AVAILABLE WE DO THIS ALL IN A PUBLICALLY VETTED PROCESS SO WE GET INFORMATION BACK FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY. TO CRAFT THE GRANT PROGRAM -- TO ACCESS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO AS MANY -- ENTITIES AND SUBMITTING AGENCIES AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WILL BE AN ON ON GOING PROCESS -- ADDITIONALLY -- WE DO ANTICIPATE -- FOR UPCOMING PROP SIXTY EIGHT RELEASE THAT WE WILL HAVE -- PUBLIC SCHOOL OF PROPOSAL SOLICITATION PACKAGE AND PLAN RELEASED IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY IF THIS APPROACH APPROPRIATION IS APPROVED -- SO THAT DOES TRIGGER THE FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD -- AND IF. WITH PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA -- YOU VAST WHAT WILL BE USED FOR ALLOCATING THOSE GRANTS A SIMILAR TO THE MAXIMUM GRANT AWARD -- THE PRIVATIZATION CRITERIA WILL BE DETERMINED -- THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- SORRY TO REPEAT MYSELF IS COMMITTING ITS ATTENTION TO CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS AND WAYS TO SUPPORT. AND ASSIST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I DON'T WANNA GO INTO TOO MUCH MORE DETAIL HOPEFULLY HAVE AN OVERLOADED YOU I HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS I HAVE MORE. INFORMATION IF YOU NEED. THANK YOU OVER OVERLOADING IS WHAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE CELEBRATE -- I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE NINE POSITIONS THAT I THAT YOU IDENTIFIED FOR US -- CIGNA -- AND THEN THERE WERE TWO THERE WAS TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO I ASSUME THOSE POSITIONS ARE. RELATED TO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S IT'S IN FACT FOR ALL OF FOR ALL OF THE DEADLINES IS THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN PLANTS A MIDDLE DEADLINE -- THE SOONER THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE THOSE POSITIONS OF THE BETTER BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO TRAIN THOSE STAFF IT'S NOT SIMPLY A HIT THE GROUND RUNNING -- PROCESS THESE ARE VERY DENSE UP PLANS THAT WILL BE COMING TO US SO -- THE DEPARTMENT IS IS HOPING THAT THE THIS REQUEST IN ITS APPROVAL ALLOWS US TO BRING IN -- PROPERLY -- EXCUSE ME THE PROPER EXPERTISE FROM STAFF WHERE WE CAN TRAIN THEM TO THE PROGRAM -- AND THEN THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY START WITH -- EVALUATIONS WELL THAT'S THE SORT OF FOOT TOUCHES ON MY POINT OKAY -- IF -- AS WE WILL APPROVED FOR THE THE BUDGET. TO IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES AND WE REACH AGREEMENT ON THE BUDGET THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN UNTIL JUNE THEN YOU'RE GONNA START YOUR HIRING PROCESS WHICH TYPICALLY IS A A LOW RENT A RATHER LENGTHY -- UP PROCESS AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRAIN THOSE PEOPLE I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE THIS GOING TO BE TIME LEFT IN THE IN THE FOR THEM -- TO AT ADDRESS A IS WHERE MY RUN ON THE THANK YOU CHAIR AS I SHARE YOUR CONCERN -- ABOUT THE DEPARTMENTS READINESS AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES THESE POSITIONS ESSENTIAL WE ARE WORKING WITH CALLIE CHAR WITH US SECRETARY CROWFOOT. AND I HAVE. MET WITH THEM LAST WEEK -- TO DEVISE A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN RECRUIT. THE TALENT THAT WE NEED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE -- WE ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS AS APPROPRIATE TO BRING ON A PARTICULAR EXPERTISE ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES AS YOU MAY BE AWARE IS -- FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED -- AMOUNT OF MODELING AND NEW MODELING HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THESE PLANS AND THE NEED IS TO BRING. ESSENTIALLY FILL THESE NEW POSITIONS WITH THE MODELING EXPERTISE THAT CAN ENABLE US TO REVIEW THEM. BUT WE ARE TURNING OVER EVERY STONE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BRING -- THE EXPERTISE ON BOARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THE NINE POSITIONS -- WE'RE REQUESTING AS PART OF OR A PIECE OF THAT AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THAT. OKAY -- I I I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE -- I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD A MEETING. YEAH AND MAYBE SOMETHING WE CAN. DISCUSS IN MORE DETAILS OF THAT I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO GET THEY WANT THE SUPPORT OF THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- JUST OUTLINED IN LIMITED QUESTION MISTER CHAIR JUST AS A NOTE THERE HAVE BEEN POSITIONS PROVIDED FOR SEGMENTAL MEDITATION FOR PROPOSITION ONE HAND IN THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDED THROUGH PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT TWO AND ON THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL DO BUT SO THIS. IS THIS WOULD BE AN INCREASE SENATE TURNING UP BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME BASS STAFF THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY FUNDED FOR THESE ACTIVITIES RIGHT BY I THINK THAT DOESN'T. QUITE AT THAT ADDRESS THE THE CONCERNED AND A HALF SO IT'S NOT EVEN SO MUCH A CONCERN AS JUST A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND -- INCREASED HAPPENED A TIMELY FASHION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH MS RICE. LIVES I ASSUME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT AM I WRONG IN THE I EVEN ISSHIN ISSUE NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT THE KNOW WHERE -- I STILL IN ISSUE NUMBER. ONE I'LL BE READY I PROMISE YOU WILL GET THEIR THAT'S JUST BASED ON IN THE HISTORY -- WILL GET THROUGH THE ENTIRE REGION. YES LET'S SO LET'S MOVE ON TO TO PARKS. YOU'RE THE THIRD BULLET POINT. WE HAVE THAT CEDRIC MITCHELL HERE FROM STATE PARKS GREAT AND WHILE SHE'S -- WALKING UP OR JUST -- TAKE NOTE THAT -- WE HAVE A STAFF RECOMMENDATION HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN SO WE'LL BE ABLE -- TO A HEARING [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CEDRIC MITCHELL ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR THE PARCHMENTS GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. AND I WON THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TO TALK ABOUT PROP SIXTY EIGHT IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME -- I GUESS THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT THE LARGEST OF OUR PROGRAMS THE STATE WHAT PART PROGRAM WHICH HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE MILLION OF THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THAT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED AS CURRENTLY -- I THINK IT ALSO HELP -- BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS I'VE HEARD -- REGARDING ACCESS AND WE'RE GOING TO ABILITY TO HAVE THE TO APPLY FOR THE GRANTS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I CAN ADDRESS THAT BY STARTING WITH ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH WE STARTED THE PROCESS WHICH IS CUSTOMARY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT. TO TO ENGAGE IN FOCUS GROUPS AND PUBLIC SESSIONS TO DEVELOP THE GUIDELINES OF THOSE GUIDELINES -- INCLUDE -- PUBLIC HEARING HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS AS WE DEVELOP THE GUIDELINE ITSELF -- IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WE MADE PUBLIC THE FINAL GUIDELINE -- THE GUIDELINE -- HAS A DEADLINE OF AUGUST FIFTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR TURNING IN YOUR APPLICATIONS. AND SINCE THAT TIME WE ALSO HAD A SERIES OF OF BOB TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS -- WHICH WE CONCLUDED AS ACTUALLY AS OF FRIDAY -- WHERE WE HAD OVER -- FIVE HUNDRED THIRTEEN INDIVIDUALS FROM AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THOSE APPLICATION WORKSHOPS ARE DESIGNED SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING -- FOR BEAR SIX OUR WORKSHOPS INCLUDING ON THE PAGE BY PAGE LIES IN THE TOOLS TIME THE STATIONS TO HAVE THE TO A THE STATE IS YOUR WHERE IS AN EXTENSION OF PROPERTY. FOR AND PROPERTY FOR WE HAD TWO ROUNDS IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- WE HAD NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REQUEST OVER NINE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS CAME TO US -- FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE'RE ABLE TO FUND OVER HUNDRED NEW PARKS AS WELL AS DOZENS OF OTHER PARK IMPROVEMENTS AND EXPANSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR HOPE IS THAT WE'LL SEE THE SAME LEVEL OF COMPETITION. WAS SEALED SAME LEVEL OF INTEREST GIVEN THAT WE'VE HAD OVER FIVE HUNDRED THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED -- JUSTIN OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS BUT OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS COLLECTIVELY INCLUDING -- THOSE PUBLIC MEETINGS AND HEARINGS ADDITIONALLY WE DO WE'VE HAD CONFERENCE CALLS WITH A NEW DOZENS OF AGENCIES ON FACILITATED. FOR US -- HAVE BEEN OVER A THOUSAND JUST SINCE SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR OF SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE IS CLEARLY -- A COMMUNITY FOCUSED PROCESS THAT REQUIRES AGENCIES TO ENGAGE WITH THE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO LIVE WITH THE PUT PROS PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE TO BE IN THE COMMUNITIES -- ULTIMATELY -- OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AS WELL -- WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SEVERAL OTHER WAYS. ALL APPLICANTS A POTENTIAL APPLICANTS CAN CONTACT THE PROJECT OFFICERS AND OUR STAFF DIRECTLY WE ARE OUR PHONE NUMBERS ARE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE. YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS -- THAT THEY WOULD LIKE -- REGARDING -- REGARDING THE THE APPLICATIONS -- THEY CAN ALSO CONTACT US BY EMAIL THEY CAN ALSO AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE DEADLINE WITH WEIRD LIKELY IT IS CUSTOMARY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT TO HAVE. ONE IN ONE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE IN THE REGION AND THEY CAN COME AND WE CAN CHECK THE COMPLETENESS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS. SO AS FAR AS THE STATE WHY PARK PROGRAM THE CORE OF THAT PROGRAM WE ARE WELL UNDER WAY -- THERE'S BEEN -- BUT AMPLE AND ENGAGEMENT AND OUR HOPE IS THAT WE WILL SEE A RECORD NUMBER FOR US OF APPLICATIONS THAT WILL BE PROCESS. CONTAINED WITHIN THE STATE WHY PART PROGRAM IS A COMMITTEE ACCESS PROGRAM. THROUGH THE COURSE OF OUR PUBLIC MEETINGS AND HEARINGS AND THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED OUR AND WRITTEN WRITTEN FORM. WE DECIDED -- TO HAVE THE THE PROGRAM BE A SEPARATE EFFORT -- IS A STANDALONE PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT PROPOSING RIGHT NOW -- SEVENTEEN MILLION IN THE FIRST ROUND WILL LOOK AT THAT AS A PILOT BECAUSE THIS IS NEVER BEEN DONE WITH BOND MONEY BEFORE. ON WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS THAT WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY OR SO -- PEOPLE HELPING US TO CRAFT WHAT ARE THE VISION FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WILL BE -- WE'RE GOING TO BE CONCLUDING THAT IN COMING UP WITH A DRAFT FOR THE PUBLIC WITHIN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS OR SO. AT THAT POINT WE'LL HAVE IT OUT PUBLICLY LOOKING AT HOW THAT. THAT DOCUMENT CAN BE IMPROVED AND ULTIMATELY WE PLAN ON HAVING THE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND APPLICATIONS STARTING IN THE LATE SPRING -- ITS IT'S SO IN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS I THINK I'LL STOP AT THIS POINT AND IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER AS WITH. AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE BUT ALSO YOUR PRESENCE AND SANDRA DINO -- IT IN HELPING MY COMMUNITY HAVE BETTER ACCESS YOU WERE VERY IMPORTANT VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN THE COMMUNITY WAS -- MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE ATTENTION NOT JUST THE WORDS THAT ARE SAID ABOUT WE WANT ACCESS. BUT THE ACTIONS -- YOUR GREAT REPRESENTATIVE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE QUESTION WAS ASKED EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE AND I QUESTIONED ALSO. ON THE COMMUNITY ACCESS OPPOSE IT WILL BE FOR SEVENTEEN MILLION IS A STILL STAND ALONE. YES IT IS SO AND HOW WILL HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE -- TO BUT IF IT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY THEM WHAT'S THE PROCESS GOING TO BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALL OF THE THE AREAS THAT MOST NEED ACCESS OR THE ONES THAT DO GET IT. THAT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION -- IN COURT TO THIS WHOLE EFFORT HAS TO BE ON WE HAVE TO STICK BUT TAKE A STEP AWAY FROM BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN. AS SIMPLY FUNDING ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WITH THE CURRENTLY DOING WE START WITH THE PREMISE THAT. IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO TO DO MORE OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING THE MOVIE WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. IT'S AUTOMATICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS NEW AND CREATIVE CREATIVE WAYS OF ENGAGING THAT WILL INCLUDE -- HAVING THINGS SUCH AS A HOME BASE MAKING CERTAIN THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES NOT JUST THE WAY BUT THAT PEOPLE WERE ULTIMATELY IN ORGANIZATIONS COMING TO COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE LOOK FOR IN OUR PROCESS THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND WE ASKED A LOT OF OUR APPLICANTS BUT WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND THE TWO THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT HAPPEN OR ARE THESE ONE DAY EITHER RECEIVE A GRANT BUT ULTIMATELY TRANSFORMS OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE INSIST ON AUGUST. DODD IN DEPTH COMMUNITY ENGAGE PROCESS. OR TO THE COMMUNITY WILL BECOME CIVIC CONTRAST FROM THE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. BY DEVELOPING -- RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL PROVIDERS THAT INCLUDES NON PROFITS AND THAT INCLUDES PUBLIC AGENCIES SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU IT'S ULTIMATELY HOW ARE THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO TRANSFORM THOSE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ACCESS IS NOT JUST THE WAY IT'S ALSO AT HOME. AND ULTIMATELY THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE AND HAVE BENEFIT THAT THAT THAT -- FROM THESE DOLLARS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THEM TO HAVE AN ON GOING RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH ACTIVE RECREATION OR WHETHER IT BE THROUGH OPEN SPACES. SO STARTING WITH THAT PREMISE WE'RE CHALLENGING NON PROFITS AND PUBLIC AGENTS AGENCIES IN HELPING US TO DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM. THAT IT'S ONE THAT WILL BE LOOKED UPON HOPEFULLY AS A MODEL FOR THE NATION AND NOT JUST BUSINESS AS USUAL. ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO DEFINE AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT PUTTING FORTH THE ENTIRE THIRTY TWO MILLION WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WITH THE FIRST SEVENTEEN MILLION OF THIS WHICH WE NEED -- TO LIQUIDATE WITHIN BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO DOING THAT AND AND IDENTIFYING ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SHIFT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IS WHY WE'RE STARTING AS AS THE PRO AS THE MODEL AND THEN THE DIGITAL FUNDS WILL LOOK AT AND SEE IF WE NEED TO EXPAND ON PROGRAMMING OR WHETHER WE NEED. TO CREATE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT MAKES MISSION IF YOU FOLLOW THE PROCESS HE'S WITH ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A DISTRIBUTION THAT HAS A NATURAL ORGANIC AFFECT. WE DON'T GO INTO THE BUSINESS OF TRYING -- TO MANIPULATE THAT PROCESS ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IF YOU LOOK AT PROP -- EIGHTY FOUR THE STATE MY PROGRAM IF YOU LOOKED AT THE DISTRIBUTION THAT OCCURRED YOU SEE PROJECTS THAT WENT AS FAR NORTH AS READING AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO AND OUT INTO THE AND THEN. INTO THE COACHELLA VALLEY ACCESSORY. ULTIMATELY -- COMMUNITY ENGAGE PROCESS WHICH WERE VERY PROUD TO BE PIONEER HAS HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR REGION ENGAGING COMMITTED. TWENTY STATEWIDE. IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE THE POLITICAL FORCES IT DOES HOWEVER TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE THE THE MERITS OF THE PROJECT. THE SITUATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES AND INSIST THAT THERE BE -- MEETINGS THAT REFLECT THEIR THEIR VISIONS. FOR THE FIRST TIME UNDER PROPERTY FOR AND THE FIRST TIME IN AND WE BELIEVE IN STATE HISTORY. OVER FOUR THOUSAND MEETINGS TOOK PLACE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED AND FORGOTTEN. THOSE FOUR THOUSAND MEETINGS INCLUDED MULTIPLE MEETINGS THAT STARTED WITH AND CASES IN SOME CASES WITH BUTCHER PAPER AND JUST IDEAS AND ULTIMATELY BECAME PROJECTS THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING AND ENGAGING. ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT SIT SAYS THAT THIS PROCESS SEEMS TO WORK IS A COMMUNITIES ALSO IN THE SAME TIME FRAME BEGAN TO TAX THEMSELVES AND ULTIMATELY GIVE FEES TO THEMSELVES. FOR PROJECTS THAT WEREN'T FUNDED BUT ULTIMATELY ARE BECOMING FUNDED BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN THAT CIVIC PROCESS. SO WE COULD TAKE FULL CREDIT FOR THAT BUT SEEMS TO BE WORKING AS EVIDENCED BY WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH -- WITH PROJECTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THIS MON. THING WAS CHAIR TO ONE OF THE LABOR THIS ITEM TOO MUCH HERE BUT THIS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THIS IS A QUESTION FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND NOT SURE THE APPROPRIATE STAFF. FOR BUT MULTI BENEFIT STORM WATER PROJECTS. ARE OF A PARTICULAR INTEREST -- IN MY AREA THE CITY COUNTY ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IS INTERESTED IN THE STORM WATER RENO I GUESS THERE'S NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED OUT OF THE BOND FOR THAT IN THAT LINE ITEM. NOT A LOT OF DETAIL ON WHAT THE DESIGNS ARE WHAT THE PLANS ARE FOR THAT NINETY THREE MILLION. I DON'T KNOW IF THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS HERE TO SPEAK TO THAT IF NOT WE GETS REALLY FOLLOW UP -- OFFLINE BUT ANY GUIDANCE -- THAT'S JUST OF A PARTICULAR -- INTEREST TO FOLKS MY DISTRICT THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING SITE YOU'LL SEE -- PROGRESS THROUGH THE GUIDELINE PROCESS THERE'S GOING TO BE PUBLIC OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES THERE'S GOING TO BE WORKSHOPS SO WE'RE GONNA FALL OR NOBLE PROCESS AND DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM BUT THE EMPHASIS ON MULTI BENEFIT STORM WATER PROJECTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK GOD THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF SHE WON I THINK THE I THINK THE REMAINING ANGELS ARE PROBABLY MOVE FOR A A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY BUT THIS ONE WAS MORE OF A AN IN DEPTH -- DIVE INTO THIS PARTICULAR -- AREAS -- I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ON THIS ISSUE NOW -- AT AND THEN -- DO PUBLIC COMMENT DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT AS OPPOSED TO ISSUE BY ISSUE -- BUT THIS -- ONE IS IS SO BROAD AND SO BIG I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME -- TO TO PAUSE. AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- INTO THE RESOURCES AGENTS SECRETARY -- ANALYST AFTER HERE. SINCE THIS ITEM WAS A LONG ONE I THINK IT'S AN A NEW WAY OF APPROACHING THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT DISCUSSION I HOPE THAT IN THE UPCOMING HEARINGS AS OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES GOT 2% -- WE CAN REVISIT SOME OF THE PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT ITEMS JUST. TO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION SO YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME RIGHT NOW SOME A LONGER COMMENT THEN THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE HEARD OVER. A NUMBER OF HEARINGS SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME -- OF FEDERAL AND ON BEHALF OF LEVINE TO TO REALLY EMPHASIZE AND THANK THE SECRETARY FOR HIS COMMENTS A AROUND HIS INTENTION -- TO TO RELIEVE PRIORITIZE ACCESS ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS ACCESS TO PARKS -- AS A CORE COMPONENT OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE REALLY WANTS TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT'S REALLY GREAT TO HEAR -- WITH REGARD TO TO PROP SIXTY IMPLEMENTATION AS THE MEMBERS OF BACK OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED. THAT THE ISSUE OF COMMUNITY ACCESS IS ONE THAT IS IS IS BRAND NEW AS WAS. MENTIONED BY THE SECRETARY AND BY THE DEPARTMENT -- AND ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- ARE CAREFULLY CRAFTED SO THAT IT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT IS ACTUALLY MEETING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE SET OUT IN PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT AND AT THIS POINT THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT OF EXAMPLES STATE PARKS HAS BEEN DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB CENTER CAN HIS TEAM AND AND ALL THE WORKSHOPS THAT HE'S BEEN HOSTING UP AND DOWN THE THE STATE -- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO ENCAPSULATE THE THE GENERAL SENTIMENT OF OF RESIDENTS AND NGOS AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB OF HEARING THEM OUT. AND THEREFORE DEVELOPING -- THIS NEW PROPOSED APPROACH ON A ON A STANDALONE COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAM I'M SURE CENTER PROBABLY FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN STALKING HIM. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND A GOOD NUMBER THESE JUST A WITNESS THE WAY IN WHICH THE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ACTING ARE OR CONDUCTING THESE THESE WORKSHOPS -- THEM IN THE COAST CONSERVANCY ARE ARE TO THAT THAT REALLY COME OUT AS AS TO AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE APPROACHING THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY. WE WE DO AGREE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONCERN I'M NOT INCLUDING EVEN A REFERENCE TO COMMUNITY ACCESS AND IN THE GUIDELINES -- OR EVEN IF THEY DO IN DOING SO IN A VERY -- GENERAL MANNER THAT REALLY DOESN'T -- DOESN'T ARTICULATE WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE IS ON HOW COMMUNITY ACCESS IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE DEVELOPED TO INCLUDING GAUGE WHEN PROGRAMS. AND IT AND THAT AND GREAT AND BRINGS ME TO THE THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS AROUND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS -- ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT -- TYPICALLY -- CAPITAL OUTLAY HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF GEO BONDS -- BUT THE LEGISLATURE VERY INTENTIONALLY WROTE PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT WITH AN EQUITY FOCUS AND AND THAT EQUITY FOCUS IS WHAT DROVE THEM TO INCLUDE THIS TO ALLOW FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS PROJECTS THAT INCLUDING GIVEN PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE ARE CRITICAL TO GETTING SPECIALLY FOLKS WILL DISMISS COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- LESS RESOURCES TAKE TO GET OUT TO THESE PLACES ON TO BE ABLE TO DO SO AND ENJOY THESE THESE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING AS A STATE -- JUST AS MUCH AS BOOKS FROM MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES CAN. AND SO IN INDIA IN. YOU KNOW KIND OF A FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN I THINK -- ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S AND FOLKS AT THAT THE AGENCY -- WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE THAT CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY INTENDED -- WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGE IN PROGRAMS AND AND HOW IT WAS WRITTEN -- BY THE AUTHORS AND BY THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS THAT ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS TO TO PROVIDE THAT -- THAT RESOLUTION HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR. AND THEN CEDRIC MENTIONED -- THE LIQUIDATION PERIOD FOR THE COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAM -- FOR THIS FIRST ROUND THAT WAS APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH RAISES IT'S MORE LIKE A TECHNICAL ISSUE AROUND ENCUMBRANCE PERIODS AND AND HOW QUICKLY THE PROJECT COMPLETION NEEDS TO BE TURNED OVER. AND AND COMPLETED -- SO ONE SUGGESTION THAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING ARE DISCUSSING IS -- AROUND ALLOWING FOR AN ENCUMBRANCE -- PERIOD ADJUSTMENT TO ALLOW FOR ONE OR TWO MORE YEARS -- SPECIFIC TO THE COMMUNITY ACTS -- PROVISIONS IT IS A KNOWING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT PROJECTS OUT THERE THEY'RE READY TO BE. TO GET MOVED ON BUT FOR THIS COMMUNITY AXIS PEACE AS THE GUIDELINES ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED IN THIS NEXT YEAR -- UNDER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GRANTS WILL LIKELY NOT GO OUT UNTIL NEXT YEAR -- WANTING TO SEE THAT ADDRESSED IS IS A PRIORITY -- MORE BROADLY TO THOUGH -- YOU KNOW AN EARLY DISCUSSIONS WHEN THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT IN JANUARY -- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT -- A ENSURING THAT PROP SIXTY EIGHT IS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO SUPPLANT OTHER -- FUNDING FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND PARKS ISSUES -- THAT THE VOTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED PROP SIXTY EIGHT AS ADDITIONAL TO WHAT IS -- CURRENTLY BEING INVESTED BY THE STATE FOR ALL THESE GREAT RESOURCES -- AND THEREFORE WANTED TO TO KIND OF HARKEN BACK TO A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO AN IDEA THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THEN SECRETARY -- LAYERED -- ABOUT. IT AND AT THE ESTABLISHED DURATION FUND WHICH IS THERE IT'S IN THE STATUTE. AND WE WE BELIEVE IT'S USEFUL AS A DISCUSSION POINT WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PRIORITIES. THAT CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH THE NOT JUST BOND FUNDS -- BUT THROUGH OTHER FUN SOURCES INCLUDING POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW GENERAL FUND AND AND OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS -- CAN CAN YOU WRAP UP YES -- AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RELIEF ON THE JORDAN FORESTRY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PROP SIXTY EIGHT THEY IF THE FULL PREPARATION FOR URBAN FORESTRY WAS DONE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- AND THEY EXPECT TO METABOLIZE THAT COMPLETELY AND IN THE NEXT YEAR -- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BEING PROPOSED -- ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BUDGET -- FOR FOR URBAN FORESTRY -- WHETHER THROUGH YOUR AFTER OTHER FUN SOURCES SO ONE OF THE REYES ACTEDAS A CONCERN AND WE WILL BE BACK TO TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT TO MEET ON A WITHOUT A BY CALIFORNIA. FIRST OFF I WANNA ECHO -- WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER'S COMMENTS -- RELATED -- THAT NOTION. ON THE NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE WE ARE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF IDEA OF STAFFING UP D. W. R. -- TO IMPLEMENT SIGMA WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDITIONAL DETAIL TO THIS PROPOSAL -- WE WILL FURTHER ADD THAT FUNDING. THAT FUNDING. BE ALLOCATED FOR STAFFING POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR SEGMENT PLANTATION AS WELL -- THE CURRENT NUMBER POSITIONS THAT ARE AT DFW ARE RELATED TO SIGNAL IS -- ARTS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAFFED -- AND AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE'S CLEARLY A SIGNIFICANT A NUMBER OF WORK LOAD INCREASES THAT WILL BE SEEN AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT REFLECTED AS WELL. AT AT THE F. W. -- BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS NOT NECESSARILY -- AND THE NEXT. ITEM TO BE HEARD -- DFW AT LARGE AYE WE BELIEVE SHOULD -- THERE SHOULD BE. A DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING ONE TIME ALLOCATION MONEY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO -- TO CONTINUE DO ITS JOB EFFECTIVELY SO -- THE SERVICE BAY IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO COVER A PORTION OF THEIR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A NUMBER OF AREAS THAT ARE STILL THERE THEY'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING OR ENFORCING. LIKE LIKE CIGNA OR WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT. AS SUCH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THAT. IN THAT DEPARTMENT -- LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID WE WANT TO REINFORCE THE NOTION THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS STILL AS PROP BUDGET PROCESS DELIBERATIONS CONTINUE -- THAT FUNDING -- THAT THAT APPROPRIATIONS FROM PROP SIX CA SHOULD BE ADDITIVE TO NATURAL RESOURCES AND NOT. BE A WAY TO SUPPLANT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN -- IN THE STATE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PUBLIC GARCIA WITH ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FIND ANYONE SPEAK TO TWO ITEMS THAT YOU RECEIVE PRESENTATIONS ON AND I WILL ENDEAVOR TO BE BRIEF -- FIRST ON VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS DIRECTOR BONHAM ND DIRECTING THEM AS DESCRIBED THE PROCESS AND YOU WHAT THAT IS ABOUT VERY WELL AND ANGRY WITH WHAT THEY YOU THEIR DESCRIPTION. AND I THINK -- YOU'RE IN BERMAN RELATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND I THINK WE ARE. LIKE IT'S HAS A LOT OF GOOD MOMENTUM -- IMPORTANT MILESTONE IS REACHED LAST FRIDAY BUT THE CEMENT OVERDRAFT -- PROPOSAL TO THE WATER BOARD FOR EVALUATION. AND WE'RE OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL THAT BY THE IN THE YEAR WILL HAVE A GOOD AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND AND IT AND I THINK -- THE SEVENTY MILLION I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS IT'S A LITTLE BIT NONSPECIFIC. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND AGREEMENT BUT I HAVE SEEN THE PROJECT WAS THAT DIRECTOR NEMETH REFERENCED. IT'S PRETTY LONG AND SINCE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE. THE SEVENTY MILLION AVAILABLE ASSUMING AN AGREEMENT COMES TOGETHER TO BEGIN WORK IMMEDIATELY -- PART OF THE AGREEMENT IS FUNDING FROM THE WATER USERS AS WELL SO BUT IT WON'T THAT THOSE FUNDS WILL TRUE OVER TIME THEY WON'T BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND I THINK PART OF WHY A LOT OF A SUPPORT OF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT IS BECAUSE WE CAN START. TAKING ACTION AND IT SOON AS IT'S DONE IMMEDIATELY AND I THINK SO -- I THINK YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT APPROPRIATIONS -- SECONDLY I WANT TO SPEAK TO A SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER FROM ONE WITH OUT OF MIND THAT YOU. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND APARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE NEED MORE STAFF TO DEAL WITH THE DAY LOSE OF WORK COMING THEIRWAY -- THE MISS ROSIE ANY OUTLINE WHAT'S COMING THE PLAN REVIEW -- SO I THINK YOU'RE THERE BOTH TEAMS ARE LEAN AND MEAN AND THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH. THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE WITH AGAIN THE A LOT MORE AND IT'S NOT. THERE'S A PLAN REVIEW BUT IT'S ALSO JUST AN ONGOING NEED. THE ANNUAL REPORTS THE FIVE YEAR REPORT AND I THINK YOU HAVE IT EDF AS PART OF A GROUP CALLED THE GROUND WATER LEADERSHIP FORM THAT'S COMMITTED TO SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGNAL BECAUSE WE SEE THIS AS ONE MOST IMPORTANT INITIATIVES TO MAKE THE STATE MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS WE NEED WE DO NEED MORE STAFF BUT YOU NEED MORE DETAIL ON THE PROPOSAL -- AND I I JUST GIVEN THE LONG TERM YOU MIGHT IS TO START BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED ADDITION YOUR OTHER RESOURCES AND PROBABLY GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM. GOING FORWARD AGAIN IT'S TWENTY YEARS POTENTIALLY THIRTY YEARS. AND MY JOB IS ALWAYS KNOWING CAN RETIRE SO EVERYBODY STICK AROUND THANK YOU.

OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT THIS MONEY IS INTENDED FOR IT TO ACHIEVE EQUITY IN ACCESS ARE GONNA HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME FINISHING PROJECTS.

THE ISSUE OF THE ASSESSMENT BEING FINALIZED WAS AT THE CORE OF WHY IT WAS IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CLOSELY WITH WITH THE CONSERVANCY NOTE THE IN THE IN THE ASSESSMENT IS BEING FINALIZED NOW.

GOOD MORNING PAUL MESA PACIFIC FOREST TRUST I'M GOING TO SAY EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS SET IT -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF AND AND I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT CONCERN TIONS REALLY NEED TO BE ADDITIVE TO WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING OTHERWISE AND THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE ELIMINATED MOST OF THE NETWORKING LAND SORT OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE G. G. R. F. -- APPROPRIATIONS AND OF FILLING THOSE NEEDS WITH BOND FUNDING TO VERY EXPENSIVE WAY TO GO ABOUT MEANING THESE -- FOR ONGOING COSTS SO LET'S REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE USING BOND FUNDS TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND NOT JUSTICE FULFILLED FOR OF BASELINE -- WHAT WILL COME TO EXPECT IS BASS LINE APPROPRIATIONS THESE PROGRAMS THANK YOU? THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS -- IS GARCIA AND MISTER MALL AND YOU WERE ABSENT WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST AND ONLY VOTE TODAY ON THE VOTE ONLY COUNTY WHICH IS LIKE THAT ON THAT. KERN VOTE FOUR ZERO CHAIR VOTING AYE GARCIA [inaudible] MULLIN. THANK YOU SO -- GET A MOVE ON NOW -- TO ITEM NUMBER. TWO THE ITEMS TO BE HEARD -- IN MY CHOICE IT'S A A REGARDING DIGITAL MIGRATION. THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND SEVERAL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE MOVING INTO A NEW BUILDING -- IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AS PART OF THAT EFFORT TO USE THIS SPACE MORE EFFICIENTLY -- WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDS TO DIGITIZE A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLIONPAPER PAGES OF RECORDS SO FOLLOWING ALONG WITH THE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER USING LESS NATURAL RESOURCES -- THIS EQUATES TO ABOUT A SET 60% REDUCTION IF YOU INCLUDE ALSO THE ARCHIVING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING. AND IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE SQUARE FEET. OF THE SPACE THAT WE WON'T NEED IN THE NEW BUILDING FOR STORAGE SO -- ALONG WITH DIGITIZING THESE RECORDS WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THEIR DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR WORK CLOTHES SO THAT WE DON'T BUILD UP ANOTHER -- BACKLOG OF PAPER PRODUCTS AND INSTEAD WE WORK TOWARDS USING DIGITAL METHODS. THANK YOU LA. WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE F.. SO -- HI -- TAKE YOUR WORD ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE -- BUT A HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION RECORDS. HOW DO YOU GET THE KERR? WE SURVEYED ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS WE WENT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. AROUND THAT IS ALL IT YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE IF YOU WANT AROUND UPPER DEFINITELY WILL THAT WILL BE OKAY WITH THAT. THERE TIMES LEGISLATURE REALLY LIKES EXACT NUMBERS [inaudible] TOUGH -- THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE -- WILL -- UNLESS THERE'S A QUESTION -- THEN LET'S MOVE TO MOTION. CHECK THAT IS THE FIRST. GREAT [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] HI. FONG GARCIA THANK MULLIN. SENATE RACE BY. REQUEST. EXCELLENT WELL -- LESS PAPER IS A GOOD THING IS I GOT POINTED OUT BEFORE -- ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS -- THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- FUNDING FOR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS SO THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS -- TO FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR DEFERRED FIRE. THREE MILLION FOR EXPOSITION PARK AND ONE MILLION FOR THE CONSERVATION CORPS. ON EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE PRIORITIZING THE PROJECTS FOR THESE FUNDS BASED ON THE MOST IMMEDIATE. HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS AND ALSO -- OTHER OPERATIONAL NEEDS. THANK YOU HI LA -- I THINK OF SOME COMMENTS YES -- AND I WILL NOTE THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO MILLION FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE S WELL AT DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS SO MY COMMENTS ARE OVER ARCHING FOR ALL OF THESE. SIX RESOURCES DEPARTMENTS WE CERTAINLY THINK MAINTAINING AND TAKING CARE OF STATE FACILITIES AND ASSETS IS IMPORTANT BUT WE HAVE THREE OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST IS A LACK OF CLARITY ON HOW THE SPENDING WILL BE PRIORITIZED BY EACH DEPARTMENT SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDED LISTS FOR EXACTLY HOW THEY WOULD SPEND THE MONEY AND WHICH PROJECTS. AND SOME DID NOT FOR EXAMPLE -- PARKS PROVIDED A TWO HUNDRED PAGE LIST OF ONE PINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF NEEDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME CRITERIA FOR HOW THEY WOULD PRIORITIZE BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW. THEY'RE FORTY FIVE MILLION WILL BE SPENT WHEN THE NEEDS ARE THAT GREAT -- SECOND OVERARCHING COMMENT IS THAT -- PROVIDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY IS REALLY A SHORT TERM RESPONSE TO AN UNDERLYING PROBLEM AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE NEEDS. AND RESOURCES AND PRACTICES AT AND KIND OF AN ONGOING BLEEDING PROBLEM AND AND THAT THERE ARE ONGOING MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AT THESE DEPARTMENTS -- THERE WAS FUNDING EITHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FOR THREE OF THESE SIX DEPARTMENTS -- CONSERVATION CORPS CALIFORNIA PARKS BUT NOT FOR THE OTHER THREE AND SO -- WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN USING STATE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IS ALSO BEING ADDRESSED. AND THEN THIRD AT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSED A WAY TO TRACK THE OUTCOMES FOR THIS FUNDING HOW WILL THEY ACTUALLY BE SPENT AND HOW WILL THE LEGISLATURE KNOW THAT FUNDS WERE SPENT AS PROPOSED. SO AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA WE PROPOSE -- ADOPTING TWO PIECES OF SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE TO TRY AND GET AT SOME OF THESE CONCERNS -- REALLY REPORTS THAT DEPARTMENTS COME BACK AND DESCRIBE HOW THEY SPENT THE FUNDING SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE IT BUT ALSO WHAT THEIR OVERALL APPROACH IS ARE IN ADDRESSING THEIR MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AND WHETHER THEY'RE ADDRESSING THEIR BACKLOG OR WHETHER THE BACKLOG CONTINUES TO GROW TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT. UNDERLYING PROBLEM. THANK YOU THE SAID THE OIL COMPANY. GOOD MORNING. MICHAEL MCGINNIS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. INFORMATION RELATING TO THE REQUESTED FUNDS OF THE PROJECTS THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT. HOWEVER AT THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING IS USUALLY A COMPONENT OF THE DEPARTMENT SPACE BUDGET AND THAT SUCH REPORTING IS NOT REQUIRED FOR BASS BUDGET EXPENDITURES. SO IN LIEU OF THE HAVE. PROPOSED AT REPORTING LANGUAGE WE WOULD SUGGEST INSTEAD THAT THE INFORMATION BE MADE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO MORE SPECIFICALLY TARGET SIR. OKAY SEC THANK YOU -- DOES THE DEPARTMENT WANNA. RESPOND ANY OF THAT. I MISS INTO AND TOTAL THE COMMENTS FROM -- OF THE LA -- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE FEEL LIKE THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING TOWARDS -- MOST OF APARTMENTS ARE WORKING TOWARDS AT COMING UP WITH A LIST OF THE PROJECTS AMONG THE LARGE BACKLOG AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. CRITICS OF THANK YOU -- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SMITH PRESS. ON THE PRIORITIZING TO THE PARKS. IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY REASONABLE THING TO TO REQUEST FOR THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION. OVER FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE PROJECTS. HOW ARE THE HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE PRIORITIZE THAT WHEN TO PUT POINT ONE POINT TWO BILLION? YEAH SO -- BRAIN DOING -- CONFERENCE IT WORKS. SO WE HAVE THE FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WE GO THROUGH A PROJECTS ELECTION TEAM PROCESS WHEREBY -- THE PROJECTS ARE ARE PRIORITIZED BASED ON FOR LIFE SAFETY HEALTH SAFETY SHARED WITH WITH FOLKS. AND THE THE GROUP GOES THROUGH THOSE AND SELECTS THE HIGHEST STATEWIDE PRIORITIES AND EVEN SO -- WE WE COME UP WITH -- NUMBERS OF PROJECTS -- IN A HUNDRED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OF PROJECTS SO WE WOULD DO IS WE TAKE THAT LIST OF THE HIGHEST PRIDE PROJECTS. AND WE HAVE A RANKING -- PROCESS WHEREBY WE WE RANK IT BASED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY WE GIVE -- REVENUE GENERATION -- THIS IS -- NOT YOUR WHOLE AND MAY I ASK. ONE OF THE ISSUES HAS BEEN ABOUT CLARITY -- AND DETAILS WHO IS THIS AVAILABLE CAN IT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO US. THE THE LIST OF PROJECTS ONCE WE HAVE -- IDENTIFIED THAT LIST WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO EXPLAIN WHY THESE LIES PARTY PROJECTS THAT WERE SELECTED WE HAVE NOT SELECTED A A LIST OF PROJECTS AS OF YET -- BY LOOKING AT THE LIST OF PRODUCTS THAT WE FUNDED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE LARGELY WATER WASTEWATER. THOSE THOSE TIMES A PRIVATE WHO EXPECT THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS TO BE COMING FORWARD. EVEN AFTER FUNDING THE FOR THE THE HIGHEST FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE -- SO VERY HIGH PARTY PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA BE UNFUNDED. BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE POINT. TWO BILLION WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE PROJECTS RIGHT. THOSE FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE PROJECTS. CAN WE HAVE ACCESS SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT PROJECTS THOSE ARE YES WE'VE PROVIDED. A LIST OF THOSE THOSE PROJECTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS FAR AS AND IN THE FALL BUT ON BUDGET PROCESS DEVELOPMENT. THAT HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE THE LEGISLATIVE IN A L'OFFICE AND WE CAN PROVIDE COPIES OF AS WELL OF THOSE PROJECTS TO YOU. THANK YOU I I WOULD LIKE THAT OKAY SO -- PLEASE SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THEN -- MISTER CHAIR ON THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR APPROPRIATE NICE ESPECIALLY IF AGAIN WE'RE DEALING WITH A LACK OF CLARITY AYE AYE YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED NOT NEEDED. I THINK THAT -- FOR MYSELF AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOTION IT WOULD INCLUDE THOSE TWO REPORTS -- AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF. OKAY -- WILL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SO ON THIS -- ISSUE THEN LET'S PROCEED TO A VOTE. BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA. MULLIN PATTERSON RAY YES I REQUEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NECKS. TO ISSUE IS THE ISSUE -- FOR REGARDING GOT FUND APPROPRIATIONS AND TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH LAST YEAR IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROCESS THE AGENCY COMBINED ALL THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS SO LIKE RE APPROPRIATIONS EXTENSION OF LIQUIDATIONS WERE VERSIONS. INTO -- ONE BC P. ALONG WITH SOME OLDER BOND REQUESTS THERE'S SOME RATED RESIDUAL BOND FUNDING FROM OLDER BONDS -- THEN WE DID THAT FOR ONE B. C. P. IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE HEAR THAT SIMILAR TO IN PROP SIXTY EIGHT WE HEAR THE LA THOSE CONCERNS. ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH DETAIL WHEN NEW POSITIONS OR NEW PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED AND WE'RE WILLING TO WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH STAFF LIKE WE SAID EARLIER ON FIGURING OUT WHAT THE LEVEL OF EACH HAVE A MEETING SET UP NEXT WEEK FOR THAT. THANK YOU -- COMMENTS FROM. YEAH SAME COMMENT MOST OF THESE ARE OUR TECHNICAL BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND SO THEY ARE. AYE AYE SOME ISSUES HERE WHERE WE THINK YOU NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL HONOR TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THEY'RE JUSTIFIED. LED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S THAT OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION THE PURPOSE FINANCE. SIR DRAGON OVER THE PART OF FINANCE JUST TO REITERATE IT WAS A KIND OF STREAMLINED PROCESS SO THIS CONSOLIDATION APPROACH WAS TO TO THAT EFFORT BUT WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMENT FROM ALLEY ONLY JUST LATER STAFF AND WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN TO A COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT FUTURE ITERATIONS OF THESE RIPPLES WILL LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU -- AT CONSISTENT WITH ALL THAT -- WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD OPEN TO BE ABLE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH THIS ISSUE WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THAT OPEN MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- FIVE FOR WHICH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RADIO REPLACEMENT RADIOS THAT. WE WANT YOU ALL TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO ANOTHER SITE THE RIVER PREDICTABLE OUT. OUTCOME ME. TOO HI AGAIN MY NAME IS CHUCK BOND AMONG THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IN BY WAY OF BACKGROUND FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME. OUR DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF THE OLDEST DEPARTMENTS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND OUR JOB IS TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THE STATE'S. FISH WILDLIFE AND PLANTS ON LAND AND OUT IN THE OCEAN. AND WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT DIVISION IS COMPRISED OF WARDENS OR WILDLIFE OFFICERS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUR WILDLIFE OFFICER FORCE AS HIGH AS IT'S EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR DEPARTMENT WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MEMBERS OF THE DIVISION. AND I THINK WE AT ANY GIVEN TIME HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED AWARDS IN THE FIELD. THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS PRETTY SIMPLE. WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT SIX TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND. PER YEAR OVER THREE YEARS. TO REPLACE VEHICLE BASED AND HAND HELD -- PHONES WHY. THE RADIOS ARE OUTDATED. THERE AT THE END OF THEIR USED IN USEFUL LIFE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. AND THE CURRENT ONES DON'T INTEGRATE WELL INTO THE FEDERAL FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY WHICH IS WHAT ALL STATE AGENCIES ARE STRIVING TO DO. AND ON THIS SIDE OF DESERVE JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OUR WILDLIFE OFFICERS HAD BEEN DEPLOYED. IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF THE LARGE WILDLAND FIRES AND NATURAL DISASTER SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO THIS IS A PRIME MOTIVATOR FOR US. TO MOVE TO THE MORE MODERN. TECHNOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED. VEHICLE BASED AND HAND HELD RADIOS THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU -- NO CONCERNS WE THINK THAT THIS MAKES SENSE AND ALSO IT IS AS THE DIRECTOR NOTED PART OF A COORDINATED STATEWIDE EFFORT ACROSS VARIOUS DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO BE TO ENABLE THEM TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AS WELL AS WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. BRASS I REQUEST. OUR NEXT ISSUE IS NUMBER. SIX REVOCATION. AND CONTROL PROGRAM ALL ABOUT -- OUR OUR LEAST FAVORITE RODENT THIS. INDEED THESE ARE RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE. HOPING TO THAT. A MOMENT TO MAKE MORE THAN A FEW PEOPLE SQUIRM. SO THESE ARE LARGE RODENTS ON THERE ABOUT THIS BIG. THEY ARE NATIVE TO SOUTH AMERICA NOT. AMERICA -- AND DEFINITELY NOT CALIFORNIA -- THE DEPARTMENT HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE NO LONGER IN THE STATE PERHAPS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. BUT IN SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD A REPORT AND IDENTIFY THE NUTRI AND MERCED COUNTY. HERE'S THE PROBLEM -- THE ANIMALS EAT. LAND AND VEGETATION THEY BURROW INTO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THE BURROW INTO LEVEES THEY COMPETE WITH NATIVE SPECIES. THEY ARE AN INVASIVE SPECIES THAT PRODUCES GREAT RISK FOR THE STATE. JUST ON THE WATER SUPPLY FRONT ALONE. IMAGINE BURROWING INTO A LEVY WHICH PROVIDES FLOOD PROTECTION AND THIS ACTIVITY PROVOKING A LEVEE COLLAPSED. SO SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAVE FOUND ADDITIONAL ANIMALS IN MERCED IN STANISLAUS COUNTY TO WOLLEMI COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. AND MARIPOSA COUNTY. THEY'RE A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP FROM THE DELTA PROPER. I HAVE A CHART -- YOU WANT TO PASS AROUND TO YOU THROUGH THE SERGEANT WHICH ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE POPULATION MODELING WE'VE DONE JUST ROUGH ESTIMATES. FROM THE MOMENT OF INDICATION FIVE YEARS OUT. IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IN FIVE YEARS WE PROTECT A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PLUS. IN OUR WATERWAYS. SO THE PROPOSAL TODAY IS. FOUR ONE POINT. NINE FOUR NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. TEN POSITIONS. AND ONE FOR MILLION ON GOING. SINCE WE FIRST FOUND THE ANIMALS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HERE ARE THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY DONE. WITHIN A YEAR WE COULD WE STOOD UP AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE -- OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. WE WE DEDICATED OUR OWN STAFF OVER FORTY OF THEM FROM EQUALLY IMPORTANT WORK TO THIS TOPIC. WE'VE FOUND MATCHING FUNDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- THE DELTA CONSERVANCY. AND WE'VE A RADIC IT'D ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE NUTRIA AND WE'VE SURVEYED BUT TO AVOID THAT POPULATION CURVE PROBLEM WE NEED THIS INVESTMENT NOW -- TO KEEP ON THIS PROBLEM. HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF WHERE CALIFORNIA IS AT THIS MOMENT. NUTRIA WERE FOUND IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY. ON THE EAST COAST. OVER ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS -- OF VARIETY OF ENTITIES. REMOVED ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND ANIMALS. AND NOW CONCLUDE. THE CHESAPEAKE ECOSYSTEM IS RELATIVELY FREE FROM THE INVASIVE SPECIES. COMPARE THAT TO LOUISIANA. WHEN LOUISIANA HAD THE ANIMAL APPEAR IT DIDN'T DO MUCH EARLY? NOW. YEAR AFTER YEAR IT PAYS TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PEOPLE FOR BOUNTIES. JUST TO KEEP. THE POPULATION SUPPRESSED. NOT REMOVED. AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE VISUAL AREA AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE LOSS OF WETLANDS IN THE BY YOU COUNTRY IN LOUISIANA FROM THE NUTRIA. IT'S MIND NUMBING. SO WE WANT TO BE AHEAD OF THIS -- RELATIVE TO THIS INVASIVE SPECIES THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THIS SITE I'M SORRY LET'S GARCIA DID YOU SAY THAT WE IT WAS THE SEVENTIES WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE DONE WITH THE NUTRIA YES. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHY NOW WE DON'T. BUT SOMEONE BROUGHT THEM AS WITH. I'M ARE YOU COORDINATING WITH OTHER WESTERN STATES ARE WEST COAST STATES I'M SO THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY JUST TO HAVE THEM COME BACK FROM OTHER STATES YES. SO OUR PROPOSAL TODAY AND OUR WORK SINCE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HIS MM FORMED BY A COUPLE STEPS. WE CALLED UP OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS WHO ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE CHESAPEAKE EFFORT. WE'VE SPOKEN TO OUR COUNTERPARTS IN LOUISIANA. OUR STATE AGENCY IS PART OF A BROADER ASSOCIATION WHICH IS ALL OF THE FIFTY WILDLIFE AGENCIES. WE'VE GONE INTO THAT ASSOCIATION TO LEARN BEST PRACTICES. AND WHILE THIS IS CONTROVERSY ALLIED MEN. WE'VE ALSO BROUGHT INTO THIS PROGRAM -- AN ENTITY CALLED WHILE LIKE SERVICES WHICH IS WITHIN THE FEDERAL UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WHY? THEY WERE THE MAIN IT TO T. DOING THE PHYSICAL REMOVAL IN CHESAPEAKE BAY. ONE WAY TO IDENTIFY THE AND FIND THE ANIMALS AS THEIR DOGS TRACKING THE ANIMALS. AND WE'VE RELIED ON THEIR EXPERTISE IN THAT FIFTEEN YEAR ACT EFFORT IN CHESAPEAKE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE WENT OUT AND SURVEYED WHAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE TO INFORM WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO. CAN I TELL YOU TODAY THAT IF WE DO THIS EFFORT IN THE FUTURE. WHERE FREE FROM THE REST THAT SOMEONE MAY BRING NUTRIA BACK AND NO I CAN'T? I'LL BUT DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IT -- IF THE ANIMAL IS AN ORGAN OR ANY OTHER NEIGHBORING STATE -- IT IS NOT IN ARIZONA NEVADA. I ACTUALLY COULDN'T TELL YOU BUT I WILL CHECK ABOUT OR AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE SO BUT LET ME CHECK ON THAT. THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AND WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE. MOTION. TO HEAR SECOND SEC THANK YOU BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA. MULLIN. SEN RAY YES. REVERSE -- AND THE OF WILL TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. GOOD MORNING NO -- KRAMER'S OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER INTO THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BUT I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT -- FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR GEN AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS IS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO A RADIC KATE NUTRIA WE APPRECIATE THEIR OUTRAGE TO STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING. WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE WE WOULD. HOPE THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN A RADICALLY NUTRIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU A CAN YOU -- AT JUST -- AND HAVE BEEN OF THE A BRIEF COUPLE OF SENTENCES -- IDENTIFY -- WHY AG WHAT WHAT WHAT THE -- WHAT THE TREE I CAN DOING GOD -- THE AG IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT NUTRI BOTH CONSUME CROPS SO THAT'S OF LOS TO OUR MEMBERS BUT ALSO. THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE ON WATER DELIVERY SYSTEMS SO IF WE HAVE A LEVEE BREAK AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED AND THEN WE CAN'T. ONE THERE'S DAMAGE -- BUT ALSO THEN IF THAT. DAMAGES THE IRRIGATION. SUPPLY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME AND ACTUALLY THE FIRST QUESTION HE SAID WAS NUTRIA WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH NUTRIA SO IT IS DEFINITELY A BIG ISSUE -- DOES -- THE AG INDUSTRY -- HAVE -- US A SEPARATE FUNDING -- OR PROGRAM TO TRY AND ADDRESS THE FISH WE DON'T BUT I DO KNOW THAT I'M ONE OF OUR MEMBERS IS -- SUPPLYING SWEET POTATOES TO USE AS BATES -- TO HELP ATTRACT THE NUTRI INTO THE TRAPS -- SO THERE THERE DEFINITELY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TO PARTNER WHERE WE CAN AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WHERE WE CAN. THANK YOU FOR STATE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ROSIE THOMPSON WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH HAVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND WE REQUEST SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THOUGHT THANK YOU -- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON THANKS -- WE MOVE ON NOW -- TO WHICH BEGINS THE ITEMS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ISSUE SEVEN AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD -- PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT BRANCH [inaudible] FUNDING. GOOD MORNING TERRY BLOOM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS LESLIE GALLAGHER I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD I THINK THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR I'VE SEEN YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO. WE'VE BEEN COMING BACK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WITH SUMMER CLASS SO WE DO HAVE ONE TODAY I WOULD JUST MENTION -- SINCE WE'RE FOLLOWING UP WITH THE NEW TREE -- THAT THE COORDINATION AMONG STATE AGENCIES HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT ON THAT ISSUE WE ARE IN ADDITION TO OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY WERE ALSO PROPERTY. WE MANAGE OF A LARGE SWATH OF PROPERTY AND WE HAVE. GIVEN. HUNDREDS OF ENTRY PERMITS FOR THIS ERADICATION EFFORT AND WITHOUT COST TO THE STATE AGENCIES SO WE ARE ALL. SORT OF WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS LEE DU AND CAUSED DEVASTATION TO LEVEES AND THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MANAGE HERE -- BUT TODAY I'M TALKING ABOUT -- OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I DO APPRECIATE THE STAFF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT THEY WERE VERY THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME DETAILS IN YOUR STAFF REPORT BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE ME ABOUT TWO MINUTES OF CONTEXT AND THEN RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTIONS -- THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED -- MISTER BONTA MENTIONED ABOUT -- FISH AND WILDLIFE BEING ONE OF THE OLDEST AGENCIES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR ONE OF THE OLDEST DEPARTMENTS THE BOARD HAS ACTUALLY BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN A LAB AND IT WAS THE RECLAMATION BOARD BEFORE IT WAS. REIMAGINE DOES THE CENTER VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD AND WE'VE BEEN OVERSEEING THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL FACILITIES FOR ALL OF THAT TIME. SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE NOW -- WE ARE NOT THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SOMETHING WE CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR AND THEY PROVIDE STAFFING AND THEY ALSO OBTAIN THE BUDGET FOR THOSE PROJECTS. BUT WE DO MAINTAIN OUR REGULATORY ROLE THAT THAT IS THROUGH AT A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT IN OUR REGULATORY ROLE. WE MANAGE LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES THAT PERFORM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ON THE FACILITIES AND WE MANAGE THESE ENCROACHMENTS THAT ARE IN AND AROUND THE FACILITIES THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL. AND THAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS REQUEST THAT THE FEDERAL BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACTIVE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN CONGRESS ALLOWED APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO BE SPENT ON THIS PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN BY THIS PROJECT I MEAN WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE AMERICAN. RIVER COMMON FEATURES IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ON OUR RADAR FOR A LONG TIME THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT AND THE STATE AND THE LOCAL ENTITIES. HAVE ALL -- ALREADY GOTTEN THEIR SHARE OF FUNDING FOR THAT WHAT THIS INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDING DID THOUGH IS PROVIDE US WITH THIS. ABOUT EIGHTEEN TIMES WHAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY GET IN A YEAR AND THAT CAUSED THAT THE ARMY CORPS TO GO INTO. HI DEAR AND ON THE STATE SIDE WE WANTED TO CLEAR THE DECKS OF ANY -- THING THAT MIGHT BE IN THE WAY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING ABLE TO SPEND WITH THIS LARGE ASK BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN. THIRTY YEARS THIS IS NEVER HAPPENED SO WE WANTED TO BE ABLE WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE COULD LEVERAGE ALL THAT MONEY. MORE RECENTLY AND THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE QUESTIONS THERE'S BEEN SOME SPECULATION THAT THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION WILL INTERFERE OR RE DIRECT THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN. IDENTIFIED FOR THIS PROJECT IN AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. TO OBJECTS THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING DIDN'T MATERIALIZE. I'M. I I CAN'T SPECULATE WITH SPECULATE ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN -- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE STATE AND THE ARMY CORPS IF TAKEN -- SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO PROTECT THIS FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED THAT PROJECT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ARMY CORPS PUTS THIS IN A POT OF MONEY THAT'S ALREADY COMMITTED AND AND THEREFORE. MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT SPOT NOT DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN. A PROCESS FOR MOVING FORWARD. AND EVEN IF THIS FUND THIS FEDERAL FUNDING WERE TO BE RE DIRECTED THIS PROJECT WOULD STILL GO FORWARD IT WOULD JUST GO FOR IT AT AT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN THIS BREAKNECK SPEED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW -- IT IS POSSIBLE IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN THAT THESE FINDINGS MAY GO ARE THESE POSITIONS MAY GO ON FUNDED AROUND FILLED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME -- BUT I THINK THE GREATER RISK HERE IS IF WE ARE NOT PREPARED AT AND THIS PROJECT DOES MOVE FORWARD AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT'S REALLY THE GREATER RISK HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE WITH THIS REQUEST. FOR REIMBURSABLE FUNDING FIVE POSITIONS TO THE BOARD TO MANAGE OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY -- ON REMOVING ENCROACHMENTS AHEAD OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER EAST LEVY PROJECT AND THAT IS SCHEDULED TO START OUT EARLY NEXT YEAR -- THE SACRAMENTO FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY BOARD HAS ALREADY AGREED TO THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN OUTLINED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE COMMITTEE FOLLOW STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND APPROVED THAT THIS BUDGET AND WITH THAT I WOULD JUST TAKE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THIS ITEM IS BUDGET IF THEIR MOTION -- I FORGOT TO ASK A LA OVER YEAH NO CONCERNS WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF BENEFICIARY PAYS PRIVATE COMPANIES PARTNERSHIP NEXT TIME I MISSED THAT JUST YOU KNOW. TAKE A WHAT A PAPER FOR MY DRESS. TO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND AND TO WILL MOVE TO VOTE. BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA MULLIN -- SENT. RAY YES I REQUEST.

THANK YOU BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA [inaudible] ONE PATTERSON. YES I REQUEST. THANK YOU -- ISSUE NINE IS THE PARENTS DAM REMEDIATION PLAN. OKAY AS YOU MAY BE AWARE PARRIS DAM AND RESERVOIR ARE LOCATED IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. AND THEY SERVICE THE TERMINAL RESERVOIR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THE LAKE PARRIS OF STATE RECREATION AREA IS ALSO A HIGHLY POPULAR AND VISITED RECREATIONAL FACILITY AND HAS A MORE THAN ONE MILLION VISITORS ANNUALLY. AND THE FACILITY PROVIDES BOATING SWIMMING AND OTHER WATER BASED RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL SEISMIC SAFETY RISKS. IN A SECTION OF THE FOUNDATION OF PARIS DAY SAME YEAR WE MOVED AHEAD WITH EARLY PHASES OF THE REPAIR OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THIS SEISMIC RETROFITTING RECONSTRUCTION OF THE DAM ITSELF WAS COMPLETED IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT CORRECTED THE SOIL TYPE CONCERNS WITH FOUNDATION. IT'S STABILIZE THE DOWNSTREAM FACE OF THE DAM AND INSTALLED AS A SYSTEM OF RELIEF WELLS TO ADDRESS SEEPAGE AND OTHER ANCILLARY IMPROVEMENTS. TO PROJECT ELEMENTS STILL REMAIN THE PARRIS DAM OUTLET TOWER IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT AND THE PARRIS DAM EMERGENCY RELEASE FACILITY PROJECT. THESE TWO PROJECTS WILL FURTHER ADDRESS SEISMIC ISSUES RELATED TO THE RESERVOIRS ABILITY TO MAKE RELEASES WITHOUT CONTEXT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A A FUNDING REQUEST FROM PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR WHICH INCLUDED FIFTY TWO MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR RECREATION. AND FISH AND WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT COST OF STATE WATER PROJECT FACILITIES. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OF FOR PARIS DAM REQUESTS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS IN SUPPORT OF THE BENEFITS OF THE OVERALL SEISMIC REMEDIATION PROJECTS -- THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE RECREATION AND FISHING WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT COMPONENTS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

THANK YOU HELLO YEAH YOU SO YOU USUALLY WITH FOR A STATE WATER PROJECT THE USERS OF THE WATER PAY FOR MOST OF THE FACILITIES AND AM BUT THERE IS.

LOOK AT YOUR YOUR WINDOW IF YOU'RE SO SO HERE IN DAVIS IS -- A YELLOW BYPASS A FLOOD CONTROL FACILITY AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. IT IS FULL OF WATER IT IS DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IS AN ELEGANT PASSIVE A FLOOD MANAGEMENT -- FACILITY AND IT IS -- AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SEE FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT UP AND DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT PROTECTS URBAN AREAS ACROSS THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGRICULTURAL AREAS SMALL COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS. AND AND WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES. LOOKING AT WHERE IS THEIR EXISTING NEED SOMEWHERE TO THE FACILITIES CURRENTLY -- DEFICIENT TO OUR STANDARDS AND TO FEDERAL STANDARDS -- AND ALSO WHERE ARE WE GOING TO NEED THOSE INVESTMENTS TO DEAL WITH A CHANGING CLIMATE SO SEALEVEL RISE I CHANGED INLAND HYDROLOGY THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. AND FROM THERE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE VOTERS OF ON CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZED THIS NEED WHEN THEY PASSED PROPOSITION ONE PROPOSITION -- SIXTY EIGHT BUT THE SIGNIFICANT FLOOD FINANCING IN EACH OF THOSE THOSE THOSE MEASURES AND WHAT THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LINK ESPECIALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN FLOOD PROTECTION. AND SPECIES RESTORATIONS OF FISHERIES RESTORATION SO WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY AND IF I MAY -- ACTUALLY MY COMMENTS ARE COMBINED THE NEXT. TO I'M ITEMS BOTH TEN AND ELEVEN I BELIEVE -- SYSTEM WIDE QUOTE UNQUOTE AND URBAN FLOOD MEN'S BOTH LARGE AND SMALL WITH A.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR LAST ISSUE OF THE DAY -- UNDER A COMBINED DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. ON THIS ISSUE -- TWELVE REGARDING THAT MAKING WATER CONSERVATION CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE PROGRAM -- MAYBE I'LL TURN IT TO MS EILEEN SO BACK TO INTRODUCE HERSELF. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD OF MY NEWLY APPOINTED -- CHAIR OF THE BOARD JOAQUIN ASK OF ALL SENSES -- APOLOGIES -- BUT HE IS CHAIRING HIS FIRST -- WATER BOARD MEETING -- TODAY OR DAY TWO OF HIS FIRST WATER BOARD MEETING BUT HE LOOKS FORWARD TO APPEARING ON VERY SOON BEFORE THE CREDIT GRAY WILL A KIND OF A LITTLE SLACK. TODAY. IN ADDITION TO HIS LONG TITLE ON MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR TURN NOW ALSO MANAGES OUR OUR WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. HELP MAKE SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO THE TECHNICAL STAFF -- AND AND OF COURSE OF WATER POURED REPRESENT AND REPRESENTATIVES HERE AND AS MIGHT BE THE WILL OF THE COMMITTEE. SO I THINK THAT THE THE TITLE OF THIS AGENDA ITEM IS -- IS APT AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION THIS ADMINISTRATION -- FOR CERTAINLY SPANNING THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION CREATION AND THAT IS THIS QUESTION OF HOW TO MAKE WATER CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE. IN SOME WAYS THAT COULD BE SEEN AS KIND OF A OF A SIMPLE BUMPER STICKER TYPE STATEMENT IT'S ALSO I THINK. REALLY INDICATIVE OF A BURIAL ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO HERE WHICH IS MAKE REAL CULTURAL CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT JUST -- INVESTING PIECEMEAL IN WATER USE EFFICIENCY NOT JUST DOING THINGS AS ONE OFF APPROACHES BUT REALLY GETTING TO THE CORE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE START CHANGING THE CULTURAL DYNAMIC. IN THE STATE SO THAT WATER USE EFFICIENCY COMES PART AND PARCEL TO FOUNDATIONAL -- TO REALLY A BUILDING BLOCK OF A STRONG WATER SUPPLY -- PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. AND SO THIS COMMUNITIES BEEN OR THIS COMMITTEE RATHER'S BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THAT WORK TO DATE. THINGS LIKE -- PASSING BUDGET MATTERS WITH LOCAL ASSISTANCE FINANCING THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WATER BOARD USE FOR DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND MARK SUFFICIENCY. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AGAIN WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO EMPOWER US TO WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE REALLY TRICKY -- TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATED TO WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN THAT OF COURSE GOES FOR THE ON BOARD AS WELL I CAN BE SO BOLD AS TO SAY THAT. AND THIRDLY AND PUBLIC EDUCATION -- THERE IS THE THE THE THAT THIS COMMITTEE FUNDED -- WITH SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS LAST CYCLE I BELIEVE LAST YEAR AROUND BEFORE THAT THE REALLY AGAIN GETS AT THIS PUBLIC EDUCATION SIDE OF MAKING WATER USE -- EFFICIENCY A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE WATER CONSERVATION THE CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE. AND THERE'S THIS FOURTH COMPONENT AND THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE WE ARE REALLY HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT IS. WHAT ARE THE WHAT IF THE WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND THE PROGRESSIVE WATER USE EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE LOOK TO OUR LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO HELP US IMPLEMENT SO BE ON PUBLIC EDUCATION BEYOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BEYOND LOCAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE? WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE I REGULATORY IF YOU WILL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE NEEDLE I WORRY SUFFICIENCY? AND HOW TO THOSE FOUR PIECES FIT TOGETHER -- THE LEGISLATURE A PAST IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LAST YEAR TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION SB SIX OH SIX HERTZBERG AN A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT FRIEDMAN. BUT AGAIN REALLY GETS THIS FOURTH ASPECT -- IN MY VIEW OF WHAT THE SUFFICIENCY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND I WILL GIVE MY COMMENTS AT THAT BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. IS -- A MODEST BUT SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL FROM BOTH STATE AID AGENCIES I'M WHO IN WORKING EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER -- BEEN VERY CLOSE PARTNERSHIP ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO A MOVE THAT NEEDLE AND LASTING ALSO BEFORE I PASS IT OFF -- IS THAT I HAVE HERE -- FIND A WAY OF LIFE THE PRIMER -- OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION ON WATER CONSERVATION AND THIS IS REALLY A DOCUMENT CREATED FOR OURSELVES FOR YOU AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE PUBLIC. TO SEE EXACTLY HOW THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES OTHER STATE AGENCIES WE WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR PUBLIC AND AND PRIVATE PARTNERS.

OUR THIRTY DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES THAT ARTICULATING ANY ISSUES WITH IMPLEMENTING -- MEETING THE GOALS OF SB -- SIX SIX DAVEY. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT HOW DOES HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSED TO ASSIST IN THIS TRANSITION. SO I'LL PASS IT OFF TO TO PETERBOROUGH STRAM -- WHO STANDING BEHIND ME HERE TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS IT'S MY GENERAL UNDERSTANDING BEFORE I PASS IT OFF OF THAT? GIVEN WHERE WE ARE AT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LEGISLATION -- THAT WE ARE NOT HEARING SPECIFIC CONCERNS -- FROM OUR LOCAL AGENCY PARTNERS THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF THIS -- BUDGET PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT AS IMITATION REALLY GEARS UP THAT WE ARE FULLY STAFFED AND ABLE TO ANSWER AND ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND IF AND IF I MIGHT ADD FROM THE STATE WATER PORTS PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE REALLY WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH -- EMERGENCY MEASURES DURING THE DROUGHT AND THEN WHAT ARE NOW BALLING SOME VOLUNTARY REPORTING MEASURE SO WE HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED AND FOR WE REALLY WANT TO INCORPORATE THOSE GOING FORWARD. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY INCLUSIVE ROBUST. STAKEHOLDER -- PROCESS SO AT SO THAT IT IS -- AS A USER FRIENDLY AS IT AS IT CAN BE BUT WE ARE REALLY AT THE FRONT END OF THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IN THIS -- IN THIS IN THIS PACKAGE THE SPIRIT JOINT WELL COORDINATED PACKAGE IS THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT.
