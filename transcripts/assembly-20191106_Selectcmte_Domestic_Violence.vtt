panelists and part of the

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.025
resource fair. The theme of

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.526
this hearing centers on the

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.328
notion that domestic violence-

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:22.929
and intimate partner violence

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.697
affects people of all races

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:28.601
gender sexual orientations age

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:29.135
groups and social economic

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:32.505
statuses I'm are three panel

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:34.340
panels will highlight best

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.575
practices for law enforcement

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:37.209
local resources and how we can

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.212
specifically support the B. T.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.281
R. Q. plus survivors were as-

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:46.285

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.323
transsexual queer questioning

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.525
intersects a special ally and

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:56.329
sexual before we begin with

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:56.929
calls I would like to share

00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:04.470
some statistics. Provide

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.405
contact to the urgency of topic.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.741
Day on average twenty four

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.676
people per minute are victims

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:11.310
of rape physical violence or

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:11.944
stocking by an intimate partner

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:12.678
in the United States. More than

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:13.245
twelve million women and men

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:16.582
over the course of a year. Let

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.553
me just be really clear I. This

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.488
is my third year and the

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.457
assembly and- being part of the

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.392
domestic violence on committee

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.494
and when we have these

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.429
conversations it's been very

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.531
eye opening for me when we talk

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.567
about the mystic violence that

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.369
everyone really it just

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.003
automatically assumes that the

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:40.339
victim is a female. Now I want

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:44.243
to make clear that victims are

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.245
everywhere not just females we

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:46.846
have males are victims as well

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.647
and as I stated there's a list

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.750
of other folks that are victims

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.385
and the part- died really

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:52.818
frustrates me is the

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.553
conversation about children-

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.357
somewhere I read that- when

00:10:58.424 --> 00:10:58.924
there's an issue with the

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:02.128
mystic violence the statistic

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:02.762
automatically goes either to

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.563
the victim. Or the perpetrator

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.899
but if a child is involved in

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.601
that that householder an

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.703
altercation the children are

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.738
not designated as domestic

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.206
violence victims so the

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:16.342
statistics are skewed in my

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:20.146
opinion because yes domestic

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:20.679
violence a affects into my

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:24.250
partners and their. But while

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:24.884
the other partner but when the

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.484
children are present at these

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:26.352
these events and we all know

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.254
that this is very common-

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.322
somehow they're left out of the

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.525
conversation. And my fear is

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.360
that if we don't start

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.162
acknowledging in addressing the

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:36.729
issue of children in these

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.731
domestic violence situations we

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:42.234
are. Are not assisting in their

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.136
mental health- well being and

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:44.637
some of these our kits

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.772
unfortunately grow up to. To be

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:50.409
abusers themselves or be

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.043
victims because they saw that

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.346
it was normal played home and

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:54.947
so one of the things I want to

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.916
stress. And continue to stress

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:58.551
and hopefully we can do some

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.252
legislative work on it is that

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:00.820
kids are all part of this

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.688
conversation as well. And again

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.690
yes the resources are for the

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.427
victims and- and some cases for

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.496
or- the abusers but the kids

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.531
need our support as well-

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.567
watching their parents- fight

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.469
or their mom or dad being

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.804
victimized does not do the many

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.539
well. Plus I was a former

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:24.143
teacher and- it was unfortunate

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.046
that in the classroom you see

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.583
manifestations of this abuse I

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.183
enough short quick story I was

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.587
and. I Ste I taught fourth

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:36.522
grade my last- eight years- I

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.156
was a teacher for sixteen years

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.791
and no one of my students came

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.993
in and he's you know kind of.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.361
Not focusing on my care you

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.497
okay as a like no because my

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.632
dad was hitting my mom last

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.267
night very matter of fact I go

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:52.471
yeah you know my- so we weren't

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:53.105
able to sleep bye. Bye yeah but

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.207
I'll be fine. Very matter of

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:58.277
fact and it just hurt me

00:12:58.344 --> 00:12:58.878
because for him it was just a

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:02.348
normal occurrence. Right and I

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:02.915
was just like as a teacher I

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:06.552
don't know what to do. Do I say

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.219
sorry you do I you know so of

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.621
course I went to the

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:10.523
administration. But the point

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:12.825
is that what happens in the

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.894
household gets manifested in

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.829
the classrooms and sometimes we

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:18.430
wonder why kids are not

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:20.533
achieving. You know we expect

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.601
them to go in and be ready to

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:26.472
learn when. There eight have

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:27.072
witnessed domestic violence

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.440
either the night before or that

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.041
morning sometimes they don't

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.943
have food because a lot of the

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.611
domestic violence. Are symptoms

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:36.382
are also withholding- monetary-

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.049
or money or food or whatever it

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.684
may be and the kids are victims

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.686
of this as well no I went off

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:42.521
on a little tangent on that one

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:44.523
but I think it's very important

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.124
for us to also. I acknowledge

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.926
that that work also needs to be

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.761
done I'm not just in assisting

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:50.930
the kids but also in counting

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.098
him. As part of this is growing

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:56.669
up in the making as much work

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:00.406
as we've done in the last.

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:01.006
Decade I it just feels like we

00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:04.743
haven't even. Touched any you

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.178
know I just feels that way that

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:06.745
we haven't really done much

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:10.282
work I know we keep. Talking

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.484
about it- and again part of the

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.753
other reason that I see a

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.354
problem is we always try to

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:16.388
address and assist the victims

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:18.724
which is. Great right because

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.426
we want to help them right I

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:20.893
don't feel that we're

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.628
addressing the actual issue

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.563
which is the abuser if the

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.198
abuser has mental health issues

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.534
other it they have Tehama. And

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.502
we're not addressing that issue

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:31.136
we're helping the victims which

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.304
again is why what we want to do

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.473
but we're not curing were not

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.575
really helping the abuser not

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.611
abuse anymore so what's going

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.446
to happen is. We're going to

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.381
remove that family from that

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:42.948
particular abuser but he's

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.516
going to go and read that might

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.285
here she are it's going to go

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.187
be victimized. Another person

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:48.787
because we haven't addressed

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.489
their their issues or their

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.258
trauma and so it's a

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.460
complicated very very

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.595
complicated issue and- you know

00:14:56.662 --> 00:15:00.199
my hopes is that in the next.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:00.833
I'm nine years- if I continue

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.203
to be. Somebody that I will try

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:04.737
to address that issue in

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:08.374
particular because we can- help

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.442
victims unless we are helping-

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:16.215
the abuser well. So anyway the-

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.484
the panelists- thank you for

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.753
being here but also the

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:21.353
resources we have resources

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.688
outside and sometimes we don't

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.657
realize that you know it all

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:25.257
and sometimes it just takes a

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:28.360
phone call. We do have a twenty

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:28.961
four seven national domestic

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.596
violence hotline can be reached

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:36.402
at. 1-800-799-7233 and- that

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.737
should also be part of the

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:42.408
conversation- and- let's see

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.677
what else. So we'll go ahead

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:45.311
and get started with our first

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:46.679
panel joining us on the first

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.580
panel at law enforcement on

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:50.349
best practices for domestic

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.651
violence calls we can be

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:56.422
Espinoza- think he said- she is

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.022
from the city of bottom park

being here let's see. And I'm

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:51.036
some of you know kind of my

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.504
background I was a teacher for

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.606
sixteen years- prior to being

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:55.240
an assembly member I was a lot

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.608
of board member and then a

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.577
school board member at the same

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.512
time as I was teaching so I

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.113
have a lot of experience in

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.648
hearing the reports obviously

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.850
and seen some of these children

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.452
go through that. But I also had

00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:08.587
the experience of having my

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.389
sister be a victim of domestic

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.191
violence and so when I started

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.493
in the assembly three years ago

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.093
I made it my mission in the

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.361
assembly sites to make sure

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.664
that- we brought awareness to

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.468
that issue I've also passed-

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:24.470
several bills. That act- in my

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:26.538
mind have helped under the one

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.607
bill that well there's all the

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.676
bills I'm proud of but one of

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:32.611
them in particular- if a victim

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.580
of domestic violence is fleeing

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:38.317
from- from the situation and

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.419
are under cal works these to

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:41.019
get a voucher for candidates

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:44.289
cycle. I'm so that they can go

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:44.823
and tell them fully- their

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.592
abuser well if you're under-

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.560
trauma you know that ten days

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.796
is you know you're barely does

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:52.598
getting your your parents

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:53.198
together and trying to reach

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:54.600
her from whatever the truck but

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.268
you've been suffering soul- the

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.537
bill that I passed I extended

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.772
that to thirty days. Now they

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.374
have- vouchers for thirty days.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:02.941
You know obviously it's not

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.810
enough by the police it's more

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.378
than the ten days that- were

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.514
previous the are given to the

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.549
victims I also had a and my

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:12.518
police- mice public safety

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.586
friends can can help me with

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.688
this- there is a bill in

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.390
particular that was very

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.259
difficult I thought from. From

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:20.893
my perspective as though it was

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:24.696
a no brainer. So the federal

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:32.271
government have a life ban on-

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:38.343
a gun if you. Have a-

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:38.944
misdemeanor. Domestic violence

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:44.783
missed. On on owning a gun if

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.652
you've had a misdemeanor-

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:47.286
domestic violence and you know

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.554
I went in there with you know

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.522
all my statistics in LA county.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.123
I'm the to six are eighty nine

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.324
percent. 89% of the domestic-

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.426
the misdemeanor domestic

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:58.163
violence- with David. Webb and-

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.832
re offend and I become felonies

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.267
I was eating 9% something king

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:04.570
I got it I got this I've got

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.137
all the statistics and I was

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:08.574
met with. Resistance and- the

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.809
second amendment was in even

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.878
the issue. Which was surprising

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.279
to me because I was going to be

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:18.317
faced with you know. In the

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:18.917
second amendment you know and

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:19.451
that was not the issue the

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.721
issue what. Are the question

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.389
from those public safety

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.023
committee to me was the what if

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.091
these folks are rehabilitated.

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:30.329
What a have a- person that has

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.297
a domestic violence-

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.833
misdemeanor is rehabilitated

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.170
and I if you know me I'm tend

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:38.837
to be a little bit forward and-

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.872
straight forward a little bit

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.507
sarcastic sometimes I said the

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.643
shin one of the- why do you

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.177
need a gun if you're real

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:46.712
validated why do you need a

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:47.312
gun. And so we went back and

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.680
forth and- the bill barely

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.816
passed I- surprisingly got a

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:52.718
past- I needed for votes and I

00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:54.419
had to Republicans and two

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:58.323
Democrats that actually voted-

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.991
to pass that bill and I'm happy

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:00.225
to say that it did make it all

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:00.759
the way to the governor's

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:02.661
office and he signed it this

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:06.298
was last year. And it is- the

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:10.302
live California now now it is.

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:10.936
Our with the federal government

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:11.536
that there is a lifetime ban

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:12.537
on. Owning a weapon. Is me. If

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.740
you have a misdemeanor domestic

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.608
violence. But the reason that I

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.543
share. With you. Is because we

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.579
all think of these issues are

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:21.246
no brainer is right we all want

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.914
to protect. Families well want

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.516
to protect victims but when it

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.485
comes to the legislative

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.520
process- we have so many

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.455
different issues. That that

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.357
come into play that the things

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:32.858
that I thought were the

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.826
bringers are not. So when we

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:38.463
do- bills I to support domestic

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.432
violence. Victims I am asking

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.668
for your help. I know that I'm

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.536
not an expert and I have the

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:46.405
experts here. Why I'm going to

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.540
be calling on you for some help

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.275
I learned my lesson the last

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.310
time I went in. Thinking yeah I

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:52.944
got this is no big deal and it

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:53.478
is. Really a hard fought

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:54.646
battle. And when we go into

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.581
battle I would like you to be

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.450
part of my- my troops. And so

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:02.287
when we start the legislative

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:04.656
year. I rolled out of the

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:10.262
undoubtedly. Introduced bills

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:10.862
to support victims of domestic

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:11.496
violence and I'll be calling on

00:22:11.563 --> 00:22:12.597
all you to help me through that

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.332
process so. Anyway thank you-

fifteen years- also worked-

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.764

against persons- investigations

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.535
that it's active select tech

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.503
the power here Eklund PD- and

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.741
I'll get started as far as the

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:03.341
law enforcement response just

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:06.711
because. I'll give the patrol

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.380
aspect of it and then I could.

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:08.947
See as we get to after an

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:12.384
arrest I can hand over to

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:12.984
detective how who's currently

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:14.352
doing investigations. These

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:18.356
these crimes so for Covina more

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:18.990
talk of being in a specifically

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:19.491
to that's what I'm most

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:20.525
familiar with- in two thousand

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.294
nineteen we've had over two

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:22.861
hundred M. S. violence calls

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:24.629
for service. And those are the

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.131
calls that we get that's not

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:26.765
including unreported domestic

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:30.402
violence incidents it's not

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.370
including rapes not including.

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:34.573
Kidnappings stockings is just

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.508
purely domestic violence

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:38.476
incidents- so we had over two

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:40.679
hundred. For twenty nineteen.

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:42.214
One resulting in a murder

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.316
suicide at an apartment

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:48.353
complex. And it's at the age of

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:48.954
twenty eighteen we also had a

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.255
an officer involved shooting.

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:50.789
Resulting from a domestic

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:51.423
disturbance at one of our local

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:58.330
parks. So. The much the call

00:24:58.396 --> 00:24:58.930
starts when dispatch gets the

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:02.234
call there's a lot going on

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:02.801
people are highly emotional

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:06.304
these types of- incidents. And

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.573
dispatch what their job is

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.241
they're trying to identify from

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.575
a person who is in distress

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:12.544
whose emotional who screaming

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:13.078
he was yelling who's going

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:14.546
through a lot of stuff- in the

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.314
background there's children

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:18.316
screaming and our dispatchers

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:18.850
trying to figure out what

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.585
exactly is going on so they

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:21.152
could send units to that to

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:22.721
that residence- they're asking

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.623
questions such as is there any

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:28.426
weapons there is anybody hurt-

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:29.027
who's in the house. Is their

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.662
children there but what's the

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:34.232
address what's happening they

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:34.833
need to send medical attention

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.236
they need captions up

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:42.173
offenders. Or anyone involved.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.609
Already is anybody on the

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.311
influence of drugs or alcohol.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.346
Is there any prior history at

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:48.980
that address- has we have we've

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:49.514
been out there before for

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:50.048
similar incidents. Is a

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:50.949
restraining orders on file for

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.218
that person- does the person on

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:56.454
the phone eight are they able

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.156
to get to a safe place or leave

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:58.723
the house. You know hope it.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.357
Within their hopefully with the

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:02.460
children. And so they're

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:03.028
running the address for the

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:04.629
prior history- and are staying

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.264
on the line until the officers

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.033
get to the to the residents.

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.402
This is the most dangerous type

00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:10.969
of call that law enforcement

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.537
officers respond to. There's

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.773
just winner emotions are

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.274
running high with persons

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:16.908
especially persons that are in

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.610
relationships- things could get

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:22.147
violent quick. And there's been

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:22.781
times when officers have been

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:24.582
baited by people cooperating

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:26.518
very much and then there ends

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.653
up being a physical education-

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.155
so they're just they're very-

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:32.390
random and every incident is

00:26:32.457 --> 00:26:34.292
different there's no similar

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:34.859
incident when it comes to

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.628
domestic violence. So I'll talk

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.330
about the officers response now

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:38.863
we obviously a we send a

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.699
minimum of two units to these

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.299
domestic violence calls that's

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:44.636
a minimum. We need more we

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.203
could always ask for more if

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.573
they're available. Officers in

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.174
a park away from location so

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.308
there's not a suspect whiting-

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:52.644
waiting in line and- lying in

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.713
wait- hiding and then you know

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:58.483
to assault us- if no one

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.084
answers the door officers can

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.251
hear what they think is. A

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.587
struggle going on inside then

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.088
we have a we could use

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:06.591
existence circumstances to

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:07.192
basically force our entry into

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:10.729
their. Parties and the children

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.397
they're gonna be separated.

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:14.632
He's going to check for weapons

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.735
you know we don't know who's we

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.302
don't know who we get is a

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.570
suspect or the victim these

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:20.372
types of incidents. At source

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:20.972
separating them we're getting

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.607
away from any type of kitchen

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.342
where there's you know

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.876
potential weapons such as

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:26.611
knives in the bedrooms or there

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.646
could be guns- even even check

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:32.317
in the furniture sometimes a

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:32.951
living room just pictures not a

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.386
gun hidden in the sofa because

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:38.189
we want to be heard ourselves.

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:40.792
US statements are gonna be came

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:41.393
from both parties so they're

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:42.427
gonna be separated but still

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.061
our offices can see each other

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.295
in case something happens-

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:44.929
we're gonna try to establish to

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.331
the primary aggressors. And

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:46.831
identify that based on

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:48.566
statements from both both

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:50.635
parties as well as any children

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.971
witnesses or any independent

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.205
party's neighbors or people

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.474
that might have heard it. Or

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:56.975
you know just any other

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.443
witnesses that were there at

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.578
the time so when we gather all

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:04.182
the information. We're gonna

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:04.783
try we're gonna do our best a

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:05.383
terminal primary aggressor in

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.686
this. The primary aggressor

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:09.320
doesn't necessarily have to be

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:10.722
someone who you know who struck

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:12.657
someone first it could be you

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:14.426
know maybe of someone poked the

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.661
other person and then the other

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:17.295
person gets in the head with a

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:20.632
pot right the prime address is

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:21.266
gonna be the person who use the

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:22.267
pot to solve that person. This

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:26.504
depends on injury. Not on it

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.540
the statements are conflicting

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:29.140
which happens a lot of people

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.442
are going to you know say

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.042
what's beneficial to them so

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:32.644
that they don't get in trouble

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.279
if statements are conflicting-

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.681
officers they do their best to

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.483
is to establish based on it the

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:38.917
totality of all the

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:40.585
circumstances what evidence is

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.487
there well as more injuries you

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.389
know what the children say-

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.023
who's credible and when I say

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.658
credible and meeting who's you

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:48.460
know who's intoxicated and

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.328
who's not- who was there with

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:50.962
with them still it's all that

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.764
stuff gets taken into a- into

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:56.334
account to establish a primary

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.203
aggressor to make an arrest.

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:00.638
Disturbance when they're just

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:01.239
when their physical and more

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:02.574
than just a verbal- someone's

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.174
going to jail. For the penal

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.742
code- so we try to make that

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.311
determination the best we can

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:06.878
and arrest someone from that

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:10.748
residents if it's just a verbal

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:12.584
altercation we do our best to

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:13.118
separate the parties have

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:14.586
someone go with a family member

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.754
somewhere else. For the

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.556
evening- maybe a local motel if

00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:20.558
they don't have any family in

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.192
the area but we do our best to

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.560
we can't force them to leave.

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.696
But we do our best to try to

00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:25.296
get them to use. To have some

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:30.301
time to cool off. So in

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:32.637
California. What we have family

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.204
domestic finds a misdemeanor

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:33.771
domestic violence. The only

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:36.341
domestic violence. Is based on

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:36.975
injury if there is any type of

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.676
injury to the person so could

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:40.612
be a scratching him a scratcher

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:42.447
Bruce to. You know. Lacerations

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.549
anything that. You know is

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.284
consistent with any type of-

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:48.453
any trauma to the body. We

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.488
applies to people every day

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:52.290
relationship whether it's

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.392
current or prior. If they're

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.194
living together. Any children

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.763
common if they're married the

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.500
are separated or divorced. The

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:03.134
misdemeanor domestic violence

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.736
is an allegation of being.

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.671
Being struck or any type of

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:07.305
physical- altercation occurred

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:12.577
of happen. So maybe if someone

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.612
says yeah he punched me in and

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:15.213
I have a to show for it we're

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.548
still gonna rest. You know

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.148
whoever the offender was that

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:20.318
punch the other person. We also

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:20.919
have a two seven three six was

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:22.453
of violating a domestic

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.389
violence restraining orders of

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.391
something already happen. And

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:28.293
that and offender comes back

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.328
and violates restraining order.

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:30.962
Then they get arrested for that

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:34.365
as well. Officers are gonna

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:36.801
document everything in a police

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:37.235
report they're gonna

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:38.336
photographed the scene they're

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:40.338
gonna photograph both parties.

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:42.540
Just so that says that the

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.642
statements are consistent as

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.844
well. And they're going to

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:50.815
consider. Number C. protective

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:52.684
order which is a restraining

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.284
order that can be done right

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.686
then and there calling a judge

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.588
doesn't matter any time of the

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:58.356
night the judge gets called and

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:00.692
we tell the judge exactly what

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.293
happened verbally and days

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:02.894
either grant restraint or they

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.562
don't rather straining or based

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.231
on the totality of everything.

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.433
And then hopefully that person

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.201
is there so we can provide them

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:10.835
with their copy the restraining

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.670
order so that they know they

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:13.238
can't come back for believe

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.574
it's- thirty days. And days

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:22.513
three days. Seven seven days

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.782
ago. And then a that that put

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.618
that give the- victim sometime

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:27.051
to get rid their own

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:27.585
restraining order from the

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:32.190
courthouse. Zero so at these

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:32.824
were also doing department of

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.559
children's services- referrals

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.427
at these locations if there's

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.463
children there they have

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:38.997
children of their children

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.531
there. There's offices can

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.300
automatically do a referral to

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:44.569
DCFS. And at the edge Chen a

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.471
east cars will be generated and

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.506
they'll be some follow up to be

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.107
conducted by agents from that

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:52.277
department. So at that time. A

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:54.746
detective will be assigned a

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.481
case and the to they'll take it

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.383
the district attorney's office

00:31:58.449 --> 00:31:58.983
for consideration of a filing

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.287
for misdemeanor felony- and

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:02.820
then the judicial system

00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:05.056
basically takes over determines

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.724
jail prison- anger management

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:10.495
classes restraining orders. And

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.297
that's based work I'll give

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:12.797
that to the park to the

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.464
detective how lawyer from going

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:14.699
to a party but that's our

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.634
police patrol officer response

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.336
to these domestic violence

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:18.870
incidents which are very

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.371
extremely dangerous. One just

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.540
to point out- you know this

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:26.277
whole entire time the emotions

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:26.944
are are high not just on there

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:30.682
and by. The officers that are

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:31.316
responding to those calls also

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:34.519
have to be careful about what

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.119
happened you saw what happened

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.654
Sacramento to that that young

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.856
officer that responded to a

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:42.360
domestic violence- call and so.

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.295
That should not be overshadowed

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:44.896
either because that domestic

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.664
violence is happening within

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:48.366
that household but we have

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:48.866
other victims are other

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:50.635
potential victims in in our law

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.503
enforcement that's trying to

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.405
you know- deal with that

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:54.972
situation so I just. Want to

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.708
say that in thank you I know

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:58.810
it's a tough job and you know

00:32:58.876 --> 00:32:59.444
we want to make sure that we do

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.346
everything possible to support

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:02.980
law enforcement because at the

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:04.949
end of the day your support and

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:10.655
you also. Supports those

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:11.222
victims. Thank we appreciate

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:16.461
that thank you. What will said

00:33:16.527 --> 00:33:22.467
the project that. So. In my

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:23.134
opinion the most balanced cases

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.535
are actually very difficult to

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:28.639
investigate. First of all a lot

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.842
of times you have witnessed

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:32.510
there your time to on a he said

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.077
she said type of incidents.

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.679
Where you don't know it's hard

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.314
to tell who the primary

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:39.016
aggressor in it's hard for the

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:42.820
district attorney when either.

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:46.057
That the right tell who it is.

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.393
In without that witness or a

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:48.926
statement from the suspect

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.561
thing yeah I did this I did

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:52.397
that. It's hard them to

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:52.964
prosecute a lot of cases get

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.632
the client. And as the wait

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:58.536
wait is. Are we do have

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.371
witnessed available like a

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.306
child which is unfortunate but

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.675
a off my child will be there a

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.277
child will say what happened. A

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.246
lot times this district

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.481
attorney feels more comfortable

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:11.048
we have a witness like that

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:12.950
that says this is actually what

00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:13.551
happened. In a separate things

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:16.521
out. In being an investigator.

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.489
What I wanna say this that. You

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.691
have to have some understanding

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.427
and compassion these cases it's

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.060
going to understanding what the

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:24.529
female or male has been going

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:26.531
through your dinner stand that

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.266
they may have been married

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:28.866
twenty years five years what

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:30.535
are maybe. They may have

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.437
children- this is not an easy

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.104
thing for them to go through to

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.872
separate all and they want to

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.474
stay together and you. Will do

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.609
the best a cation you last the

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:42.480
victim male female. What do you

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:44.849
want to now. Do want that

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:45.416
person prosecuted for doing

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:48.519
this the time. You're talking

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:49.053
about a week later is the

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.755
answer is no they don't. You

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.723
have to understand why though

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:53.357
in the reason being is because

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:54.692
they're a is highly emotional.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:58.629
Feelings they have. Share bank

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:00.364
accounts share mortgage. On

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.667
their lan each other for to get

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:06.537
by so. Something happens in

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.473
often when a victim does not

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.308
want prosecution anymore the

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.477
district will not prosecute

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.145
that case unless we have a good

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:16.714
evidence or a victim that can

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:20.451
see otherwise for us. Thank you.

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.052
I'm just some statistics on

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.653
average it takes a person seven

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.822
times before they actually

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.624
leave an abusive relationship

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.326
so an officer's gonna respond

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.528
many times this is the tenth

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.062
time they've been to this

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:34.398
house- and the increase of

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.234
danger increases when that

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.436
person leaves the relationship

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.070
so within the first seventy two

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.571
hours that a person leases on

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.406
that their highest risk of

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:44.742
being killed. So those all have

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.410
to be taken into consideration

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:47.011
as well if that person knows

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.713
their partner better than

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.615
anybody else they know the

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.884
danger that they possibly can

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:53.451
be and if they try to leave

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.387
this situation- even if at the

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:58.556
moment it might be the best

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.725
situation the- danger really

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:04.662
increases for them. Thank you

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:08.766
any okay. I do want to add to

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.635
what you just said I'm there on

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.537
the for you know for the

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:13.170
officers the one thing that has

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:16.274
helped us having army there I

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:16.908
have the first contact with the

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.609
victim so when the Victor comes

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:19.143
in sometimes obviously she

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.511
doesn't want to talk to the

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:22.547
officers so- I go ahead and set

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:24.482
up an appointment with them.

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.250
There's going to be times when

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.386
she doesn't want to come in but

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:28.986
I persist on the call right I

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.388
you know tell them what I do I

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.456
let them know that I'm not an

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.157
officer but at that I'm here to

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.759
help so one of the things that

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:36.594
has helped us is that I never

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.829
ask why are you still there

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.598
because I know that it takes

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.667
many years I was actually a

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:44.368
victim of domestic violence it

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:46.437
took me over ten years to

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.038
actually get out. So I think

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.606
that helps us there with the

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.541
police department to have me

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.376
there because again I've relate

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.745
my re you know the past

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:55.413
relations with the victims so I

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:56.714
pretty much much know exactly

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.349
what they're thinking that-

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:58.916
half finance their own have

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.585
somewhere to go there are

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.587
afraid they're being threatened

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.522
with the kids so one of the

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:06.324
things that I always. I ate

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.693
here their story and I actually

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:12.597
went but I do. Tell them. Is I

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.130
let them know that I was a

00:37:13.197 --> 00:37:18.736
victim. And that I did it not

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:19.337
for myself for that I wasn't

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.538
thinking about everybody else.

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:21.172
But because I didn't want my I

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:23.107
have two boys. And I don't want

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:23.741
them to actually do the same to

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:24.475
other females. So I kinda go in

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.109
that direction where we have to

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.911
help. And cut the circle kind

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.646
of the cycle went to make sure

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:30.448
that. They understand if they

00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:30.881
continue being those

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:32.483
relationships. It's hard but

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.019
they're just going to continue

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:35.553
and their children will

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.621
continue doing the same thing

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:40.691
and accepting. In their lives.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:41.325
So that's what we do there.

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:44.562
That's what's easier for us to

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.029
go ahead and have that

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:48.366
relationship with the victim.

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.534
And then to that- comment or

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.403
those the information. I want

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.970
to ask in general because I

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.739
know that- senator Rubio just-

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:58.175
passed a bill about training-

00:37:58.242 --> 00:37:58.809
is there. And I'm don't want to

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:02.413
put you on the spot is there.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.382
Some kind of a training- that

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:06.651
assists- the law enforcement

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.252
officers because- you know. It

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.287
you're explaining all of this

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.256
but it right away I'm thinking.

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:12.890
What experience you know do you

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.659
have. And you know are you

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:16.394
treating this call. As you know

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.396
just another call and that you

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:18.996
know you did explain that it's

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:22.500
very different. But I guess my

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:26.537
own walk left already. He was

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.104
there the trainer of some of

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:54.365
those. At. Will work. Thank you

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.701
and then to that question as

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:58.569
well as you know what- do your

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.171
cities have in place right now-

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:00.738
in terms of support for the

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:04.375
officers and- training- when

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:04.909
assisting in these calls

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.243
because I can't again I just

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.844
can't imagine you know your

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.679
blood is pumping in your

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.314
adrenalin is pumping and having

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:10.881
to answers to some of these

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.750
calls not knowing if you're

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.652
going to be a victim of the

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.420
some something or you're gonna

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:18.522
find already somebody sees I

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.357
mean that would be my biggest

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.560
fear is that when I write that

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:26.864
you there's already people that

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:30.201
have been. You know injured.

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:32.536
Yeah we're very lucky to have

00:39:32.603 --> 00:39:33.104
Chen occurred our department

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.338
because she's a good liaison to

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.307
have with the with her

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:40.344
experience and where she works-

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:40.911
you know rather to jobs that

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:44.348
she has. So but we there is

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:44.949
specialized training that you

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.317
know officers could get sent to

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.385
as as- Mister Allen said

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:48.986
earlier you know the academy

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.554
there increasing your their

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.122
hours there's a block is a

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:52.456
forty hour block a plea for

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.558
domestic violence- but it's

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.192
great to have a liaison it you

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.794
know ballpark of you know it

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.295
you know. I'm sure week maybe

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.531
we could do something regional.

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:01.098
Where you know them sure not

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:02.433
every please park and have that

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.535
but- she's a regional resource.

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.637
And you know just providing

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.739
briefing trainings and talking

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:09.240
officers that alone is

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:12.476
beneficial she puts on formal

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:16.547
training as well- she expand on

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:17.181
that. Some of the training that

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:20.651
you give up. As I've been able

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.586
to do the briefings with

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:23.053
officers provide those

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.622
resources. When they'd go out

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.657
on calls and there's victims

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.325
and we have a direct link.

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:28.959
Where they can call our twenty

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.795
four hour helpline as well. And

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:34.398
places victims into- the

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.867
emergency shelter. That is the

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.569
local shelter in the San

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.136
Gabriel Valley area which is

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:42.506
the wings shelter. Thank you

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:43.040
and then so a follow up

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:46.443
question- what barriers. Do you

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.579
see our I mean I'm sure there's

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.447
a many by the way. What are the

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.516
top maybe one or two barriers

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:56.420
that you see- in. Assisting or

00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:56.954
serving domestic violence

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:02.760
victims. I know money is part

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.528
of it but. If we aye what are

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:08.132
the biggest barriers anything.

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:08.732
I think for us a ballpark I

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.868
think it's all the time I we do

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.937
I think I S. we both do

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.772
different in a way where

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.440
different nam hats there in the

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.542
city so it's a little bit hard

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.511
but I think one of the things

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.680
is all the training. For us I

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.849
think within often this out

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.517
enough but as far as barriers I

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.986
mean it's just more of the time

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:29.453
in the funding for the

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.656
departments. Thank you and

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.758
then. So barriers for the-

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.493
victims well and you providing

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.431
services for the victims. I

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:41.098
think one of the biggest things

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.867
is just like you mentioned

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.602
working with the kids and

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.537
helping to build that

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:47.104
prevention piece and working

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:50.174
with the entire family so we

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:50.641
really try to provide

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:54.645
education- to the community as

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.614
well as- helping to teach

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.081
people what a healthy

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:58.582
relationship looks like so that

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.818
that cycle stocks because it is

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.120
a learned behavior. Thank you

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:06.423
and then- one last question-

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.525
because I think- this is our

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.828
last- domestic violence hearing

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:11.362
of the ear so this is our

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.496
fourth line and what I also

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:16.734
have been- hoping to address is

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.369
the LGBTQ community because I

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:22.373
know all- being in Mexican- you

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.308
know being of Mexican. Just

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.110
facts a whole nother level of

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:28.445
barriers if you well you know

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:30.648
our our communities don't

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.383
necessarily accept LGBT Q. no

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:36.487
kids and so I feel like. And as

00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:37.087
a school board member I also

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.656
saw then specially in middle

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.224
school some of those kids- bore

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.726
suicidal- and then they got

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:44.962
involved in relationships that

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:45.496
were not healthy and they

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:46.597
continue to get the views

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.465
because they didn't feel

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:50.501
comfortable coming out to their

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:51.135
parents or you know whatever-

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.569
what have you a whole bunch of.

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:56.373
Of more more issues to the LG

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.642
to be a kid community because

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.377
you know if women and men are.

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:04.648
Ashamed of speaking out I am

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.383
trying to get help for domestic

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.452
violence I know the deal to Q.

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.554
community also as you know and

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:14.325
is more- prevalent especially

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.560
in Latino communities and I am

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.262
from ballpark so when I was a

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:18.762
little bit board member

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:19.296
involved in park I thought

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:22.666
that. Was a big issue is there

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:23.300
any you know anything else that

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:32.710
we can do a visual. Train any

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.310
partners just what the hell to

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:38.615
up. Community that we think we

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:39.216
can help with raging so that

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:39.817
you all have the resources for

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:40.384
that particular community as

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.720
well. I think one of the a good

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:43.387
idea that I think would be good

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.788
is actually trying to get into

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:45.422
the school districts like the

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.690
actual high school's. Junior

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.324
highs because we actually see

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.059
this happening at a younger age

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.461
I know that for a fact so I

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.696
think if we were to partner up

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:53.297
with the school districts and

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.533
start there. In you know bring

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.201
some of these programs and talk

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.836
about it I mean the talk about

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:00.637
everything else might as well

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.573
start talking about the- the

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:03.173
teen dating out the violence

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.610
behind it- and then you know

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:07.211
adding more of the other stuff

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:07.811
information that students need

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:10.514
to know. Perfect domestic

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.616
violence affects everyone so

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:16.520
it's no gender- and really it's

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:17.121
about building an inclusive

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.655
community so where everyone

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.624
feel safe to reach out for

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.626
resources and letting them know

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:24.428
where they're at so with the

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.296
officers they're able to

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:26.930
provide resources when they go

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.499
out on phone I mean out on

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.234
calls that were able to give

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.302
out numbers so that whoever it

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.471
is in the community that's

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:35.005
being affected has a place

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:35.506
where they can call when

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:38.208
they're ready. Thank you. Any

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:40.444
other comments that you think-

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.746
should hear about. Yeah I think

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:43.380
I think it's just report as

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:44.515
Walter mine officers is not

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.817
always he said she said anymore

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:48.519
you know it's you could have

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.454
been done if anybody's just

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.021
remember like eight but he

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:52.423
could be a victim- you know

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:54.591
when we're going to calls and

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.326
you see two males are two

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:58.395
females. It's not a battery

00:44:58.462 --> 00:44:58.996
it's a domestic violence yet

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.831
this that was that

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.332
relationship. And that's the

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.234
and I'm time I like the dating

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:04.802
relationship yes absolutely

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.503
ship as well as- a builder for.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.839
Now someone might you know they

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:09.406
might have some intuitions

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.808
about officers and we might you

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.609
know not. Be sure of what we're

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.344
dealing with exactly so- again

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.580
training- and just and you

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:20.284
asked earlier about some of the.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.488
The is like the- the problems

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.022
are the trump some of the

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:25.656
troubles was earlier question.

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:30.294
What the barriers there- and a

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.794
lot and a lot of it is

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.463
cooperation victim cooperation

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.598
it's hard to get a to get to

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:35.165
get a victim to cooperate

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.600
because you might you know a

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.435
month later they may be back

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:39.069
with that person and they don't

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.504
want anything done and then it

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.439
kind of puts you know the law

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:44.575
enforcement and the judicial

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:45.175
system out of. At a standstill

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:50.347
so to say. Wiseman and- that's

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:50.948
our whole other topic but you

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:54.318
know the- social media-

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.720
bullying and- stocking and I.

00:45:56.787 --> 00:46:00.557
Really is. I'm also domestic

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:01.158
violence even though it's been

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:02.526
there's no physical interaction

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.028
and I just social media brings

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.463
a whole nother level of. Of I

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.732
wish I love it but I hate it at

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:10.634
the same time because I see a

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.336
lot you know even within my

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.505
own- friends and I'm- barred

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.673
from the leading people because

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.475
I'm a state of officials I

00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:19.042
can't delete folks but I see

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.511
some of the things they post

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.312
and it's- it just makes me

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.248
cringe. Because where you are

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.517
modeling for kids really you

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.418
know some of these folks that

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:30.154
that start posting no

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:30.687
inappropriate content an

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:32.489
appropriate on pictures you

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:34.158
know they think it's no big

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:34.791
deal by they don't. You don't

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.593
realize that their kids are

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.595
watching our kids are watching

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.497
and you know it also adds

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.733
another layer of a of abuse and

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:44.735
sell but that'll be for another

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:46.603
conversation because I think we

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.372
can pull up a whole other on.

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:48.939
Day on bills to sit that

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.674
specific issues so I just want

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.676
to thank you for providing your

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.711
your comments and not thank you

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:56.680
for the work that you do and

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.749
again I want to be a partner

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.384
with you and I know that-

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.419
senator Susan would be as

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:06.590
office. No were. Were excuse me

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:12.696
for both. To ensure that we

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:13.330
make some kind of headway- with

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:14.565
domestic violence I think. You

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.165
know I wish I can say that we

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.733
can- completely. I'll get rid

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.569
of it but the unfortunate- part

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.304
is that we know that we can

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.573
sell- anyway would thank you

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.508
very much- and you know.

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:25.142
Hopefully you'll be around for

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.710
questions. The other thing that

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.378
I found in my previous-

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.347
meetings that some folks that

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:30.948
that may be here. That have

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.783
questions or not. I'm going to

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:36.353
ask in public so please be if

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.020
you can make yourself available

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:38.789
for anybody. We need to be

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.357
sources or just somebody to

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.526
talk to I really would

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:50.200

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:09.599
of the questions that you had

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:10.834
brought up earlier one of the

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:14.204
issues that we find is that

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.339
there is a huge lack of

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.642
language services- and because

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.544
of that- because a lot of our

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.279
clients that we serve for

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:24.414
immigrants as well- they're-

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:28.285
able or unwilling to access. On

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:32.889
the services. That we provide

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:36.626
for working on trying to. So I

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.929
have a little bit of a

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:42.299
different agenda- almost city

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:45.035
sorry from my age. I'm I had

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:45.669
one two and three that I wanted

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:46.336
to cover would that be okay

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:48.538
absolutely okay so first of all

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.172
it's an honor to meet you thank

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.640
you for the invitation. This

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:51.274
last minute I'm so grateful to

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:52.843
be here. The first thing I

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.811
wanted to talk about was a

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:55.412
little bit about my story and

00:51:55.479 --> 00:52:00.817
why I'm here- I actually was-

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:02.319
well I am an immigrant from

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:06.523
Mexico I came here at age nine.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:11.194
And. Had suffered a lot of

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:11.761
experience a lot of domestic

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:12.329
violence my own parents- we

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:14.564
were in Chicago. And my mother

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.533
my father in this you know I.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.702
Say about the male victim truly

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.871
believe in the male victim my

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:22.572
father was the male victim. I

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:26.309
only got four years of.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:26.943
Interaction my father but it

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.845
takes one parent. To raise a

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.349
stable person a stable child

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:36.419
and I hope that I'm semi stable.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:37.053
In a reflection of those four

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.522
years that I had but so my

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.357
mother kidnapped us and brought

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.492
us here to California- I don't

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.294
want to get too deep into the

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.429
story but just a little bit

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.030
about why I'm here because I

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:50.333
think it has substance- I came

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.536
here at age. Twelve to

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:56.806
California- with my mother and

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.642
eighty four month old brother-

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:02.245
my mother had a lot of issues

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:04.347
TV multi provisional pattern

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:06.583
for us well- in left me- here

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:10.387
as a child so I became a mom at

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.856
twelve years old of a four

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.524
month old baby and I struggled

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.526
I live the streets. Up is being

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:18.795
from DCFS I and I say I have

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:20.530
substance because I want to get

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.499
into when I get into the

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.868
resources and my request for

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.303
resources- so I actually

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.572
survived- out in the street

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:30.607
basically I work seven days a

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:34.144
week I went to school I hid

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.580
from the system. I had you know

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:38.315
my cheese also neighbors that

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:38.815
helped me- Reyes brother

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.550
sometimes they are you know

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:42.519
they're a great resource to you

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:46.256
are in so with that at age

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:48.625
fourteen ended up with- in high

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.427
school with my abuser so. I

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:54.564
ended up and he I was in the V.

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.165
for twenty six years with my

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:58.335
abuser and I can tell you the

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.337
in and out of Y. victim stay

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:00.937
and I fell up some framework

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:04.407
around that that work- I recall

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.643
being a child in sitting in a

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.313
corner. Of covering my ears and

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.482
telling myself that I was never

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:20.490
going to be anything. In life

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:24.260
and I had no hope for life.

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.429
Then I re experience that in my

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:28.465
own TV. I remember- living with

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.032
my abuser is sitting in a

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.700
bathroom corner by the toilet

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:33.103
saying just. I want in my life

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:33.703
you know but I guess I didn't

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.337
have enough courage to do that.

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:34.904
Or I had my brother to take

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:36.339
care of. So having said that

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.308
the second thing that I want to

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.477
talk about is how- it make his

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:44.247
angels got established- I

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.383
actually went to school- during

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:50.420
my TV. And I was hiding to go

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.422
to school supposedly I was

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:53.056
working in but I was actually

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.824
going to school behind the

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.660
scenes so that my abuser would

00:54:56.726 --> 00:54:58.628
not find out. I lived a lot of

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.597
terror in that relationship.

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.432
But is strengthened me and

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.467
that's reason why I'm here- I

00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:06.569
ended up leaving my abuser

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.738
after twenty six years. And I

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:12.642
give all the credit. To officer

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:18.782
Gus was sitting in the back.

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.382
Always here supporting me all

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:24.521
over there he moved. He

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:25.155
actually after I left my abuser

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:28.892
I met him. And he is the person

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:29.492
that Tami whether true love

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:30.927
less about and what a healthy

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.595
relationship less about he the

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.531
person that protected for my

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:36.733
abuser. And we ended up getting

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.367
married for a year but in all

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:38.234
the hopping from one

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.403
relationship to the other which

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.405
a lot of TV victims do doesn't

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.674
work out but we love each other

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:48.712
like. Family. He's always there

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.680
to support me and- you know he

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.849
he will be he will be what made

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.451
me who I am today. Because of

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:56.553
that I decided I want to go

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.354
back to school so I went and

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.957
got my a Sadie in France a

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.625
clinical psychology because I

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.394
wanted to work with the victims.

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:08.398
So in my internship I wanted to

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:10.467
understand the perpetrator. And

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.435
what I did is I actually did my

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:14.704
first internship là AB one day

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.439
where the twin palms. I

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.742
discovered a lot I discovered

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.777
that they are also victims and

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.779
I really appreciate what you

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.581
said earlier about not

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.516
addressing the aggressor they

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.685
are victims but I feel that

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.553
there is chemical issues

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.622
involved with the aggression

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.824
peace. And that is why the

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.426
aggressor is the aggressor I'm

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:40.296
in so Becky saying gills came

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:42.799
about on my second internship I

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:43.399
decided that- to put together

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:46.369
based on my own reflection

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.605
framework. The framework is

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:54.410
that if I knew my legal rights.

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:54.978
I would have gotten out wait

00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:58.648
earlier. I the second thing

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.517
would be therapy how do I deal

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.352
with my past traumas and stay

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:06.322
grounded in stable in the third

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.658
piece is formal education

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.493
because I it I am a former I am

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.662
a an educator I am actually a

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:14.464
college professor full and so

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:16.533
everything that I do is donated

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.501
time- with back his angels. And

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.503
I felt that having that

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.639
education is what really save

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:26.543
my life and that of my children

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.110
because I see that they are

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:28.311
breaking the cycle of violence.

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:32.482
So in terms of support- I am

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.617
here to say that one of the

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:36.419
biggest disappointments working

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:38.454
out in the community is a lot

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:42.325
of competitiveness among agency

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:44.260
rather than- being United and

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:46.362
not talking about this area I'm

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:46.963
talking about I do a lot of

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.166
work in LA. And so my mission

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.535
is to move out here because I

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.737
hear that there's a scarce you

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.439
know the resource are very

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:58.408
scarce on here it is something

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:00.176
this is where my heart started

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.378
in a hope to move out here

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.714
secondly everything that I do

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:05.348
with Becky's angels is out of

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.616
pocket and is extremely

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.718
difficult and stressful and I

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.653
have to tell you just two weeks

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.022
ago I wanted to close down the

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.424
clinic because I am tired. I

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.559
haven't funding I have a child

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:20.730
in college- you know to write

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:21.331
grants I'm the only one that

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:24.334
does all this work on my own.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:24.934
And so my phone is constantly

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:28.671
blowing up. Third thing is one

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.340
of my missions is to get

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:30.840
together with different

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:32.976
agencies to put victims first

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.711
and not funding to that's one

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:36.579
of the things that I discover.

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:37.113
Like I said it was a huge

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.316
disappointment that's white-

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:40.950
I'm working you know where I'm

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:44.320
working in so to put together a

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:46.356
group of agencies within their

00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:48.691
reach and- to get together at

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.193
least once a month to discuss.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.562
Best practices for the area

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:54.530
best practices how we can share

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.699
sources to help are victims in

00:58:56.766 --> 00:59:00.536
our community. Lastly I get

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.372
disappointed every October

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:06.109
because this is the second

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:06.676
awareness meeting that I at

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:10.546
ten- related to domestic

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.482
violence. We're not out in the

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.417
spotlight in October and I know

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:16.619
that cancer month it that's

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.655
also important but if you look

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:24.360
at stats. D. V. dads are higher.

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:24.894
Dodd then people die from

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.629
cancer breast cancer. And so

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.431
what does that tell you we need

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:30.566
more awareness in our community

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:32.669
we need more support and it

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:34.537
takes you guys to bring that

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:36.506
the know that support- there

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.908
was something else I wanted to

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:40.677
share. Add Becky singles how

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:42.378
that god created us in my

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:46.282
second internship- I did I put

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.451
my for work I develop

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:50.486
curriculum around it a lot of

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:50.987
what the officer set is

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:52.622
collaboration with the PD I can

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.791
connect with everything each

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.392
person said at this table in

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.561
the first panel. Because that's

00:59:58.628 --> 00:59:59.062
what it takes it takes

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.897
collaborative work between PD

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:04.667
and are agencies as well as the

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:06.369
community- one of the things

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.671
that I discover is- the officer

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:12.408
talked about the CFS. I deal

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.544
with most of the DCFS cases

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.946
where the children are removed

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.616
because the victim was in TV

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.452
that's such a punitive system

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.287
the children go to date go to

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.322
foster care because I work with

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:26.789
them all the way into

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.391
reunification. And they come

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.493
back for someone they left

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.094
there's something wrong with

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.628
the system and I went through

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.530
that myself so I know first

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.699
hand- the second thing that has

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.701
been extremely helpful and I've

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.903
been managing to kind of keep a

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.772
float in LA. Is a one stop

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.242
center what does that mean when

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.811
the victim- and the children

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.580
get removed the victim goes to

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.248
court is having an advocate

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.784
like the lady that was here and

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:58.588
this and- to talk to the victim

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.390
to will testify to hop in bed

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:04.494
processes because the dark very

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.662
dark tunnels call it a- whole

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:10.366
this lonely. For I and you have

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:11.000
no one by your side if I would

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.535
have somebody like her I would

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.771
done wonders. But I did and I

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.372
had to do everything by myself

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.775
was all he was a support. The

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:30.253
one steps their children- cord

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:40.163
will may take the individual.

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.632
To prevent losing their job

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:43.266
they go there and they get all

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:46.636
the resources in one day. They

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.538
learn they collaborate with

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:49.072
other people they become

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.706
friends and they help each

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.475
other as a community so I am

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.446
hoping that. You support me

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.247
what that are support us and

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:58.848
I'm hoping to mean more than

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.483
seize in this area and that I'm

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.385
welcome in this area because I.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.019
Everything I do is doesn't I'm

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:06.389
not looking for money I'm

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:06.923
looking for work and I'm

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:10.293
looking for results. Thank you.

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:10.860
Thank you thank you for your

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:14.597
story- you know and- it's true

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.399
that you know we all walk- and

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.634
talk to people and have no idea

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:19.235
what they've gone through or

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.703
what they're going through

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.505
right now. Once I really

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.440
appreciate you opening up- or

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.442
story- but it up and it also

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.411
makes as reflect again on the-

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.713
services that are not provided

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.348
and one of the issues that I

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.150
mentioned earlier. You know how

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:38.521
point is language. Appropriate

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:42.859
resources because. In this area

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.627
for example you know we have- a

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.729
Spanish is the primary language

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.833
but I commute back and forth

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:51.434
from San Diego on a we have a

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.871
big. Ending community care and

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:58.407
so that that- we are the need

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.041
for a different language there

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.476
is very different than it is

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.110
in. The center valley and soul

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.612
can you maybe speak on on what

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.614
you are all doing to provide

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.214
those language services and-

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.349
are you even able to meet the

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:10.553
demand- for those language-

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.857
services. Sure so- firstly

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:15.491
thank you for pointing that out

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.559
one of the biggest issues and

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:20.496
that we do find is that- cam

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.465
with language. If I am an

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:23.132
immigrant individual of English

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.600
is not my primary language. I'm

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.435
afraid to speak out because I

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.036
don't know what my resources

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.738
are I don't know if I go to

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:32.275
DCFS office if. By exposing

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:34.710
myself- and giving information

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.546
about my abusive partner

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.447
whoever they may be. If I may

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.783
be detained or deported that

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.620
kind of thing. And a lot of-

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:48.758
API. Survivors of domestic

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:54.430
violence and sexual stole.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.165
Personally because of the

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:56.732
cultural stick marketing our

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.801
dirty laundry but again because

01:03:58.868 --> 01:03:59.468
of that fear that they're going

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:00.636
to get out it they don't know

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.438
the resources are there. So

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.072
what seat half the agent's cam

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.907
phone was trying to accomplish

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.642
is- providing that kind of

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.511
intermediary a service where we

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.479
can help them navigate the

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:11.047
systems that we have here in

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.415
California in language- this

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:13.049
includes things like going to

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.784
DC fast going to court-

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.419
children supervision

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:20.323
accompaniments- we also do-

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:24.193
start a company. So sexual.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:24.827
Assault response team like when

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:28.764
he. I individuals at the

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.666
Medical Center getting the exam

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:32.602
done we are there to offer

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.470
emotional support and kind of

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:34.971
guide them through that

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.806
process- one of our issues is

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.574
that we are primarily based on

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.443
create town that's where a

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:41.077
community center is. But as I

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.079
think everyone here probably is

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.847
aware of so many Asian folks

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.649
are out here in the same people

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.784
Valley. And in fact a lot of

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.786
our- survivors that come to us

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:51.354
through a hotline or calling

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.690
from here. And the problem with

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.359
that is that some of them maybe

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.461
to drive- some are fearful to

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.630
do so. Traffic is awful- so

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:04.267
what we're trying to do is as

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.168
you were mentioning as well-

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.537
partner more with- individuals

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.506
and agencies in this area to.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.408
Choose firework farther east

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:14.277
work because that's definitely

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.679
where the need is- we have done

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:20.416
quite a bit of- recently

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:20.950
preventative work with API

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:24.420
youth. In think Iran all hambre

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.422
on in this is to hold break a

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:26.956
whole culture of violence

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.758
thing- so things like TV in the

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:30.693
home- teen dating violence.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.762
What we're wanting to spread

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.563
our case management and

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.499
counseling mental health TV

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:40.403
services for on this area. So

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:48.511
we're hoping that. You know

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:49.078
interested parties will come

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:52.415
reach out connect. Question so

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.884
when you're talking about- you

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.519
know collaboration do you guys-

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.321
have you know kind of a system

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:58.954
where you see a you know I can

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:00.723
call. And see if she they can

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:01.357
help me with this language that

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:04.327
we don't I mean if there. Is it

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.395
just you guys are doing in a

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.029
reserve some kind of a central

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:07.663
I mean I have no idea so that's

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.698
why I'm asking because it just

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.433
seems like. You know if you can

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:11.033
provide some of those- last

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.601
systems in that language that

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:13.169
you know some of the other

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.737
agencies can benefit from your

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.639
resources. To be able to help

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.507
folks navigate in their own

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.609
language so- one of the great

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.578
things about our program not

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.480
not to like puff it up or

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.349
anything is that you should you

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:26.949
should. Absolutely that's why

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.718
we're here. I think you it's we

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.619
have a twenty four hour

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:32.688
hotline. And we have a team of

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.824
about forty folks right now

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.425
we're very small- but the most

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.694
of a speak a secondary.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.663
Language so when someone calls

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.832
if the council. On the hotline

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.500
does speak that language we can

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.101
connect with a staff member

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:48.371
that does. If that's offer may

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.573
not be available we also have a

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.341
look like a huge volunteers

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.443
speak various languages and me.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.044
Connect to different services

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:56.345
that can provide an interpreter

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.514
over the phone. And so I think

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.148
they mean that I mean it makes

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:02.485
it. More accessible even if

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.754
it's just to inform the

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.322
survivor of research- and I

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:10.393
think role it is you know when

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.595
you call us. You don't have to

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:20.469
leave right now. Sometimes it's

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.036
impossible. And we have the

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:28.577
safety number. Makes so much

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:30.413
more welcoming and- how little

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:31.046
to even discuss TV in the first

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:36.852
place. You know I am sure that

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.654
the majority of the

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.222
constituency that I represent

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:40.856
its primary Spanish or Hispanic

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:44.427
and- do you have any of the

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.362
issues that that the Latino

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.230
immigrant community has I have

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:48.764
experience with some folks

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.366
that. Know the mother wouldn't

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:50.966
leave because the father was

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.568
like you know if you leave I'm

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:54.370
gonna report to all to

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.772
immigration and in I'm gonna

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:57.339
get you departed and so that

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:58.507
constant fear. Also as a you

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.309
know obviously a barrier by but

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.411
I don't want to assume because

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:04.513
I think you know what we talk

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.515
about with all of the right we

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:07.082
all this team that that the

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.617
immigration issues is papered

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.252
on aids is mainly for the I

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.621
Latino Hispanic community. But

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.857
I would like if you share the

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.792
issues that you will run into

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.296
in terms of- immigration and

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:20.896
you know being threatened- for

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:22.531
their immigration status as

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.567
well because again we all seem

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:25.167
to think that it's just a lot

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.235
in the community that's going

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:26.836
to this but I want. You know-

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.571
acknowledge that it's not just

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.473
that but the community so if

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:32.408
you can address or not sure of

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.477
your experience in that area

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:38.247
sure I mean definitely. In in

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:38.881
the entry media it it there's a

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.583
huge focus on the Latino

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.618
community in the immigration

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.286
issue. But definitely I think

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.789
just historically throughout

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:47.289
the years with the A. K.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:56.599
community- so many of us coming

01:08:56.665 --> 01:09:04.406
in. But sometimes it happens

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.509
sure I and whatever- but when

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:08.344
they get to the states- if

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.279
they're within the beast a

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.147
partner who is a citizen or-

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:12.748
someone who has some form of

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:16.519
status. Or or not even- they're

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:18.521
constantly getting the threat

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.623
of. If you do X. Y. Z. I'm

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.658
gonna call the police and

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.259
they're going to arrest you in

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:24.793
the many arrested again get

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.430
deported- you have no access to

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.031
services out here because you

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.633
don't have status. It's a very

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:32.735
very common feared I think a

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.403
lot of our clients have. So

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:38.140
actually most of my survivors a

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:38.774
common in house to our shelter

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.609
programs. In fact. Almost all

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.611
of them have immigration issues

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.346
that we have to sort through.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.482
Whether that's getting- their

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.049
own visa going through the

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:50.386
green card process accessing-

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:50.886
status through Volos of

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.354
violence against women act.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.823
Because they have to separate

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:58.427
their own immigration case from

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.429
their abusive partner. And then

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.598
our runner solo- and then we

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:03.198
have quite a few Israelis as

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:06.335
well- they fled their home

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:06.969
country and then they came here

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.604
and then. You know more stuff

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:12.374
happened. On so. Choose to

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:13.008
return your question it's very

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:20.583
very prevalent. I can actually.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:26.355
Thank you thank you for that.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:28.591
At the White ABC of San Gabriel

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.191
Valley we never deny anybody

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.826
based on language we've been

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.161
very creative in how we're able

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:32.728
to provide all the services

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.663
that we offer to any client

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.365
regardless of the language-

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:36.899
anything from bringing in

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.634
interpreters we- also use the

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.769
language line. That is this

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:41.337
with our crisis twenty four

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:44.473
hour hotline- in addition we

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:44.974
have worked with other

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.742
agencies- to be able to provide

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.410
our clients the services. I

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:48.944
didn't want to touch on

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.312
something that you mentioned

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.414
and that was- the need. For

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.350
funding for services for

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.452
clients oftentimes DCFS does

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:57.086
require. Individual counseling

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:57.653
parenting domestic violence

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.821
services and although all of

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.489
our services are free we found

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.424
it really difficult to connect

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:02.992
our clients with individual

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:04.560
casting and parenting that is

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.829
free. And especially if they

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.597
are leaving their home and the-

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.799
are already trying to figure

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.534
out housing. Then it makes it

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.670
really difficult to play an out

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.271
of pocket for the services so I

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.374
did want to touch back on them.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.542
Thank you for that- if I may.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.511
First I want to see thank you

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:25.014
see Pat is wonderful I have

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.384
worked with you guys- in LA-

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:32.388
and I don't know for. Me

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:40.262
personally I feel. Competent

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.331
enough culturally to be able to

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.700
serve- you know like the Asian

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.935
Pacific- community so we do do

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.604
a lot of work and they're very

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:50.339
responsive so I wanted to

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:50.906
publicly thank him for that

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.574
because I had a case. Not too

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.209
long ago where I was and I

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:56.278
think it was that LA community-

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.747
hospital. And the victim had

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.549
just gotten here and same thing

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.651
exactly what you said and I

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.285
made a call. And then they came

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:04.787
right to the hospital they took

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:08.557
over. Of for me personally what

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:10.292
we do because I can't stretch

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:10.893
out I mean very stressed out

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:14.463
already. Is I let them know

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.699
that I rather you know. That

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.600
transform over to a place where

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.636
they're going to understand

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:21.236
their needs more but I'm not

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:22.404
going to leave them. And I

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.540
remember this client holding my

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.475
hands couldn't make it with me.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.744
But she believe me you know I

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.479
wasn't gonna leave until

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:32.247
someone came. And just the

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:34.383
happened over was like a big

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.652
deal for her because she felt

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.854
that safety piece. Thank you so

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.389
much thank here your

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.524
administrators for the nice

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:52.401
work that you guys do in. LA

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:53.035
and I'm really hoping that they

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:58.440
get reported out here. Thank

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.609
you all and in terms of funds

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:02.177
you know it's always a battle

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:02.845
and- Sacramento with the budget

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.546
and- but I do think that

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:05.180
there's other ways that we can

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.715
support- I. Hope we have some

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:08.717
some local grant writers that

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:10.686
work for cities and school

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.454
districts all you know I want

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.423
to ask them to do. Pro bono the

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.057
eat you know how grant writing

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.558
arts eventually they get paid.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.192
Based on the grounds that they

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:18.727
receive except for what they do

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.095
in cities and in school

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:20.729
districts as they get a monthly

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.698
retainer for that. So there's

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.566
one in particular that I want

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.201
to- kind of talk to see if

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:26.835
they're willing to at least do

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.837
that I'm pro bono and then they

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.672
can get paid based on the on

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.341
the grounds that they received

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:32.975
because I think. You know even-

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.510
at the state level last year-

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.745
senator bell and I were eight.

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.614
Six twenty million dollars for

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.181
domestic violence right and

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.783
then because it was a big.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.484
Issue well apparently it wasn't

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.553
that big of issue this time we

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.490
only got forty five. Thousand

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:49.091
dollars think about that forty

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:49.658
five thousand for the whole

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:54.863
state. Forty five thousand for

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.865
the whole state and so is sold

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.367
the battle begins again. I

01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:59.001
thought I'd Hey we got twenty

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.602
million you know we were going

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.771
to keep getting this funding.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.706
Well lo and behold you know

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.408
that was on a per eighty this

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.610
year so it was forty five

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.244
thousand dollars. So the fight

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.579
begins and luckily for me I

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:12.447
have now another- ally in the

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.583
Senate- that we can.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.685
Collaborate with to try and get

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.387
and the these grants right

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:18.954

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.726

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.162
thousand dollars is not gonna

us and Rubio havoc- committed

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.738
to. To making that budget ask

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.273
again it's a long process. And

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.277
it's basically it's like you

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.580
know a cracks you know you

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:45.247
throw that if any hope that the

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:45.848
lands on where you want it to

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:46.849
be. But in the meantime I do

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.684
want to connect you with some

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.819
of these local fund a- grant

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.420
writers. And all make the page

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:52.821
and ask them to do. You know

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.857
something at and help you with

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.124
some of these grant writing-

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.327
because I know even writing a

01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:58.927
grant is just. You know hours

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:02.331
and hours of work in research.

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.266
And so I please commit to that

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.368
I'm committing to having a

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:06.969
budget ask a follow up here.

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:10.505
And hopefully we can you know

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.574
keep make. Asking your to the

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.109
point where they could they-

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:24.653
not. Leave them open and up to

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.390
one. Point five. Those who have.

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.459
Hold on community- baby in

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:32.294
reality it is and it's a it's a

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.329
you know. A California problem-

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.632
and- through the work that I

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.433
was doing I also found that-

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.101
domestic violence if we want to

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:42.337
talk about budget- costs.

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:42.871
Millions and millions of

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.640
dollars that if we put invested

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.408
in the prevention and the

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.077
support. We would be able to

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:52.714
not spend but that's a whole

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.148
again. You know that

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.549
conversation. Goals kind of.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.318
Out of sight out of mind with

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:56.885
some of these folks because

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.787
they they- look at. You know

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:02.391
budgetary- priorities like.

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:03.025
Parks which are important but-

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.826
you know. Sometimes we have to

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.395
balance that can I add

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.530
something now that you mention

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:12.234
parks. One of the biggest-

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.469
pieces for me facility. I

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:18.407
started LGBT open their doors-

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:20.909
to. In groups there and I a no

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.344
I don't in my time. I have on

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.780
an average of thirty to forty

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:28.650
people. Upper group we need

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:34.389
every Saturday. And part of

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:34.990
that work is because I was so

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:38.593
terrified. The police. When

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.963
they can feel comfortable they

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.597
make the police their friends

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:43.031
you know they start

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.666
collaborating- in every cities

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.535
region in those types of

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.169
resources so for me ideally my

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:48.870
dream would be to have all of

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.806
us in one building when we can

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.674
just say Hey who can serve this

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:56.511
victim. Thank you thank you

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:58.580
that- that is a great goal and

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.248
hopefully we can get to that

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:00.849
point so I want to thank you

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.417

public for over fifty years-

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.930
the started from the basement

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:58.467
of the cathedral and Adams in

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.402

on document it so from there-

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:06.842
that's where they started and

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:10.312
then within time we expanded to

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.881
sixteen clinics. So now our

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:16.351
focus the mission of the Johns

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:16.918

any part of. Of the U. S.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.858
because not only when we

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:23.458
started our transgender health

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:26.828
program. Which was five years

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.296
ago we started with eight

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.932
patients a transgender patients

01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:34.202
within the period of. Five

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.371
years we have expanded to

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:36.905
serving two thousand five

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:40.375
hundred trans gender. And

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.110
through our transgender health

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.412
program not only do we offer a

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.046
hormone replacement therapy we

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:48.383
offer meant mental health. And

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.420
we also focus on the public

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.489
because the chances of AB

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.324
papers clinic and we also serve

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.460
the undocumented population say

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.362
they don't have any health

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.397
insurance or or anything at

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.366
all- they would not be

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.735
discriminated or turn down

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.436
based on color race religion or

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:12.374
gender- everybody will be seen.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.509
And if you have private

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.511
insurance or if you have medi

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.547
cal or Medicare that's a plus

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.682
because to our transgender help

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.517
program. Our patients one of

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.486
the being patient of ours for

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.655
about a year not only do they

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:27.255
qualify for gender dysphoria

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:30.825
surgeries- that the medi cal or

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.527
the private insurance. Will

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:34.629
cover and that's reason why

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.998
would he have our therapist in

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.767
our clinicians because he comes

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:42.604
out of our clinic so. Our

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.171
clinicians they need to know

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:44.639
there are patients are mentally

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.641
stable in order to we see

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.710
whatever perjury that they're

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:50.478
seeking because there's certain

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.380
surgeries that they just cannot

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:52.981
be reverts. So through that

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.783
once they're done with their

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.751
therapy they submit the

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:57.385
referrals and they're ready to

01:20:57.452 --> 01:21:00.322
go and not only do we have. Our

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:02.357

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.459

program specifically for our

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:06.895
trans individuals we have been

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.730
victims of hate crime for

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.420
on that of putting myself out

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.656
there. Of survive means- doing

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.458
to sex work even though I do

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:37.092
have a high school diploma have

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.560
higher college education. It

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.629
was very difficult for me to

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.564
get a job or to be employed for

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.599
the simple fact of just being

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.301
who I am being a trans woman of

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.470
color. So things to think

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.805
John's opened up a lot of doors

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.207
a lot of players for myself. To

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.409
advocate not only for my

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.645
community but also advocating

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:57.178
for the public and for the

01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:03.251
undocumented- as an immigrant.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.287
I focus on the public because

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.656
it wouldn't be right for me

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:08.823
just. The focus on the LGBT

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.692
community N. are victims

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:14.562
advocate program. One of my

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.096
coworkers which is no the

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:18.967
cruise. He's our new with

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.169
avocat that he's Charlene and

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:23.138
he's willing to learn as much

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:27.008
as- not only for all but the

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:27.575
rest of the team. En us we

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.977
connect them with whatever it

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:31.446
is that they're speaking- not

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.047
only to mental health health

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:37.118
care. And whatever it is that

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:37.719
the need to go. To the right

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:42.590
date. Of what they're looking

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:43.224
for and throughout. Our program

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.194
we also have our Neiman Marcus

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:48.863
James which we help our transit

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.433
individuals. I'm to make their

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:52.634
lives but- changed their name

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:58.540
and mark on. Their driver's

01:22:58.606 --> 01:22:59.140
license in California ease in

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:04.579
all. Our transit parliament

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.080
program which helps our

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:10.618
patients. Excuse me on how to

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:11.252
create the resume needs are job

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.322
interviews and how to behave ed

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.824
themselves in a professional

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:20.495
work environment and what they

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:24.232
completed all. Of the big. An

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:24.833
opportunity where they would

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.634
not be given the who they are.

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.636
And on top of that we also have

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.505
our dental which is open and

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.340
available for everyone so if

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:32.874
example if we have an

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:34.709
undocumented patient the house

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:36.511
no kind of on employment

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:38.713
history or whatever it is that

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.682
they're doing to make the ends

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.484
meet they call based. On their

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.753
income so is there on a human

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:46.788
it is likely they will qualify

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:52.327
for my health LA which is-

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:52.927
it'll cover health care mental

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:56.564
in dental. And medication and

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.132
if it's a surgery that it's

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.333
medically necessary. It can

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.435
also be covered as long as as

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:01.069
their provider- does the refer

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:06.541
all. And based on that- I've

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.710
learned to grow so much through

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:12.514
the thing John not only that

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.382
they empowered me but- I was

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.851
one of their first patients and

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:20.488
employee who has gone. The

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.724
majority of- gender dysphoria

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:26.361
surgeries. Approved in other

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.530
words I have opened up a lot of

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:30.532
doors for our transit leans who

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:32.434
are seeking- third and

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.669
surgeries. And through my

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:38.706
advocacy- able to advocate more

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:39.207
through the transgender

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:40.842
advisory board counsel for the

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.744
city of Los Angeles being a

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.712
voice for five million people

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.381
and also in collaboration with

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:48.817
the LAPD IGBT working group.

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:50.618

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:54.322
advocating for my community and

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.291
through my higher education. I

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.326

you would like us to. Know and

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.090
then I'll ask a couple

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.293
questions as well say- so just

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:32.827
some quick history on the

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.195
center valley LGBTQ center

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:34.829
we've been around since twenty

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.631
eleven- started Pasadena as the

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.333
Pasadena pride center. And we

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:38.867
started simply with your

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.869
support groups and during those

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.804
work groups we discovered that

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:43.271
there were many many

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:46.541
underlining issues that each of

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:50.445
us face- as LGBT Q. people kind

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:52.313
of set up more interceptions

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:52.914
than most people. So we get a

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.716
lot of people of different

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:56.518
races different ethnicities

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.486
different classes- we didn't

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:02.490
get some survivors a DP- IPV on

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:02.991
is a part of our current

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:06.461
events- we don't get a lot of

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.061
them because we don't have. A

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:10.798
fake are programs that service

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.467
those people because we are

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.469
entirely volunteer based CA.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.704
Everyone that works all of our

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.606
board members nobody is paid

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.675
we're all their optical and

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:22.844
here basis- so a lot of the

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.646
work we do is. In addition to

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.548
our regular jobs- and don't

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:32.620
have a permit. Space right now

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:38.526
we partner with the. Arcadia

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.695
you see see. Around seventy

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.262
demos Tunis and they have a

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.430
they own historical mansion and

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:42.964
so we operate out of that

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.799
during our- hours are the only

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:45.366
times. That we are open we

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:46.668
don't have walking hours but we

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.770
do have- Google voice number

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.405
which is our phone. And anyone

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:50.972
can call anytime and we have

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.707
received TV calls IBV calls and

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:54.676
we do you refer them to the LA

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:55.310
LGBT centre. But I've gained so

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:58.346
much our knowledge today. So

01:26:58.413 --> 01:27:00.582
I'm so happy that I can- refer

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:01.215
them to other people. It might

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:02.550
be close there are might be

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:04.385
more willing to help very.

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:04.986
Interested in helping- some of

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.521
the things we deal with are

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.289
mostly about accessibility- so

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:12.727
we often find. That people are

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:13.227
worried about the legal

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:14.429
definitions of domestic

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:16.831
violence. The violence that has

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.299
been perpetrated upon them. The

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:20.568
considered sick Rylance they're

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:22.570
worried about being outed to

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:23.104
their family or to their

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:26.708
employer- there are a lot. Of

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:30.645
survivors so many people do not

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.413
talk about it that are LGBT Q.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:40.388
they are survivors of TV IPV.

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:46.494
And often times. Women in

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.763
particular on face higher DV

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.065
and IV V. and they are

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:51.699
instances of death- so they're

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.067
not a lot of survivors and even

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:56.270
in instances like- last April-

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:58.906
twenty eighteen. Lease teenage

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.875
couple and a money California-

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.844
they had an instance of DVD and

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:03.378
one of them instead of the

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:06.214
other to death. And there was

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.549
another incident it's not far

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:09.117
from there care where it is

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:10.385
right now but another it was

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.453
another gay couple and one of

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:12.954
them was killed in the

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.589
altercation. And so that kind

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.324
of ship the community and

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:16.991
thereof approached us and asked

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:20.495
us to give more- programs on

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:21.129
those sorts of things so right

01:28:21.195 --> 01:28:22.563
now we have up your support

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.532
groups. Are per support groups

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:28.569
are. Have a game night which is

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.203
considered a pre support group-

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.505
it's for all people under the

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:32.507
LGBT Q. umbrella we have. A non

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.742
binary your support group a

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.611
grief. Your support group a

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.312
transcript of workgroup. And

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.748
amends for support group in a

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.316
women's for support group- so

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.552
right now the mostly focus on

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.821
like meeting together and going

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.289
through like a grieving process

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:50.458
other. We also have like from

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:54.629
those- the people that have

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:58.366
grown and have. Got what they

01:28:58.433 --> 01:28:59.000
need they needed to get out of

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:00.368
our per support programs. They

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.570
started social groups and so

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:03.204
they're able to connect with

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:04.672
the community and that's really

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.607
what we as- a kid like a

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:10.244
community center there. Thank

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:12.714
you in- I'm going to ask on the

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.549
same question any additional

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:16.617
barriers aside from many

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:17.285
because we all know that that's

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:20.321
the number one- barrier for us

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.457
to be able to support by what

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.425
other barriers- or state my are

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.561
facing the LGBT. Community I

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.128
know we talked a little bit

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.663
about you know just a

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:32.366
culturally- it's you know it's

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:34.435
a stigma just in itself but

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.671
what other- issues do you see

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:38.606
that are facing the LGBT. One

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.308
of the barriers that we've-

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:42.810
recently for and was that a lot

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.278
of the programs are located in.

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.781
The city of Los Angeles- as

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:47.415
being in the San Gabriel Valley

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:50.818
and- a lot of our clients do

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:51.419
not have transportation and

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:52.687
that's a barrier. On it's very

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.188
difficult for them to access a

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:56.557
lot of the I'm services that

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.526
would specialized with the LGBT

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:04.332
Q. Q. plus community. And so-

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:06.400
for us specifically we are

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:08.503
always looking to branch out

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:12.573
and act I know that we have-

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:18.913
with. Some of the agencies

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:24.318
locally but- when we look.

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:24.919
Thank you for. Today all this

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.788
is a- close down- it it's

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:30.324
difficult when. It's not local

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:30.958
if it's an ongoing service such

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.593
as mental health services that

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.161
would be for example weekly

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:34.328
appointment and every week the

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:34.962
client would have to figure out

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.297
how to get and if it's in the

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:36.898
middle the Los Angeles it is a

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:40.201
commute from here. Thank you.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.470
Also a lot of the barriers not

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:44.772
only that we face. Through the

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:45.206
RGB TQ it's a lot of

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.743
homelessness. Specifically the

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:52.213
trans women because once-

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.282
before their transition or what

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:56.284
the this type of transition

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.851
when they come out to their

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:59.020
parents and tell them- this is

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:04.425
the way I feel. I'm now G. B.

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:06.194
T. or K. or transitioning what

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:06.828
are they doing instead of being

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:10.298
support at what they do they

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.533
throw money to the street. At a

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.502
younger age in nowadays the

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.136
trans coming up younger younger

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:16.771
so what we need to do is try to

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:20.441
educate the parents. Because

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.777
not only by throwing their

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.679
children into the street that

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.814
could lead to more trauma

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:32.186
drugs. Sex work. And

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:32.753
incarcerations and on top of

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:38.392
that. For education so not only

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:38.993
are they being bullied through

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:42.663
school but. They have to do

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.498
what they have to do in order

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:46.500
to survive and the next thing

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.603
you know they wind up in in

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.571
jail and imprisoned in there.

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.540
Nothing out there so what I ask

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.642
is this how to do something to

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.611
educate the parents. To learn

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:58.646
how to stand by their siblings.

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.815
Because that that's the reason

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.550
why there's a lot of

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:04.685
homelessness within the LGBT

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:07.054
community. And also along. This

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:10.358
try to work on funding to

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:10.825
empower. Not only is

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:12.360
specifically the kinds

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.695
community. Hello also a lot of

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:18.399
the LGBTQ communities. Because

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.635
for employment. Because a lot

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.570
of people does not a lot of

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:23.037
places I'm sorry a lot

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.772
employers does not want to

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:28.609
hire. LGBT Q. or trans

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:34.415
community just because. Trance

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:35.049
our community members they have

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:36.550
higher education degrees but

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.419
was holding them back it's-

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:40.721
just be who they are and they

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.556
have all the qualifications.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:43.124
That's what I advocate a lot

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.926
and- working with the

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.260
transgender advisory board. We

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:50.665
focus on and a lot of the

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.867
challenges that the community

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:54.769
our face the and in one of them

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.938
is the homelessness and

01:32:57.004 --> 01:33:02.310
employment. Well thank you very

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:02.977
much if you have any additional

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:04.812
comments but I the competition

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.714
is important again you know we

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.549
talked about- language barriers

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:10.851
and in this case we're talking

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.520
about just barriers you know

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.555
just the mobile- barriers and I

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.724
completely understand that was-

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.693
why made that comment earlier

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.695
about you know the Latino

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:24.699
Hispanic community- if you will

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:25.266
come out you know the first

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.801
thing. Is disown you and you

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.669
know as a parent I have a

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.236
twelve year old and in the

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:30.805
world and I always wonder how

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:34.775
is that I can love my children

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:36.644
so much. Like when they were

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.412
born I just love them so much

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:40.681
bye bye- the minute you say

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:46.354
something like I a M. you know.

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.556
Transgender out to be two then

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:49.056
all of a sudden you the

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:54.161
supplement it never on the.

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:54.762
Ballot I think the vision for

01:33:54.829 --> 01:34:00.801
the. Because they're still your

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.803
children. Now I am again. As a

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.638
mom you know I'm speaking as a

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:05.272
mother because I cannot see how

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.474
I can love them so much and

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.074
then they- tell me something I

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:08.376
don't want to hear. And then

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.411
can disown a child so the

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.012
education for parents I think

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:11.612
it's important but you know of

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:12.446
course. We can only do so much

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:13.047
of the services for the LGBTQ

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.582
community- is there are

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.617
important and I. Also one to-

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:20.221
acknowledge that the home. This

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:22.523
issue because I do see that a

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.692
lot- for LG Q. teens not Mister

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:28.662
the adults that teens are the

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:32.433
ones that can't find. Homes are

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.335
couch surfing and never mind

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:36.404
trying to find employment- so

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:37.038
there's at age fighting between

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:37.638
thanks there's some statistics

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:38.739
between the ages of. Somewhere

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:40.608
like around thirteen fourteen

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.410
to eighteen that they don't

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:44.345
really feel supported- by any

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:46.347
of our programs and so I think

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:48.416
we need to do more to try and

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.518
address those issues- with the

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:52.620
kids and so hopefully we can-

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.755
start- ask. For some help with

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.791
the tools arms up. Education

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.659
and incorporate you know

01:34:58.726 --> 01:34:59.226
because we're talking about

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.895
because you're right I'm a lot

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:04.398
of the issues- are. Different

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.967
but at the end of the day- you

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.402
know of being a sex workers

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:10.604
also it's- is by land right and

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.540
so. They get beat up so it may

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.642
not be intimate partner and the

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:16.744
sense of relationships but it's

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:20.614
still- being abused- because

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.583
they have no other choices all-

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:28.389
I want to thank you for that-

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:28.989
at this point I will. Open it

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:34.495
up if anybody. Wants. To come

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:34.962
state. I really would

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:40.701
appreciate it. When we can I am

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.536
not been talk from there. Can I

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:46.340
speak on yes absolutely. Down

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:46.907
with our parent education is

01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:48.709
that it's often nine that line

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:50.511
next people when I feel and

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:51.145
that's I mean let you know that

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:52.480
the now but the exes- gender

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:53.114
neutral marker so it's not that

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.248
the Lennox community is. More

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:54.849
homophobic another communities

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.483
I don't I don't want that to be

01:35:55.549 --> 01:35:56.250
like a source of confusion-

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.319
there is a huge clear line X.

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.821
community and they're very open

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.256
and they're very welcoming-

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:04.325
it's just that a lot of times

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.460
Lennix people tend to be very

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:08.362
religious and religion is very

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.664
hopeful. Right I'm- not

01:36:10.731 --> 01:36:14.535
necessary early. Next makes

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.437
them more home. As for the five

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.071
take. It just so happens that

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.472
that's kind of the way it turns

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:19.073
right we find many many line

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.441
experience that are. So willing

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:24.378
and- one hundred percent. Into

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:24.912
are you supporting their

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.914
children when they come to our

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.749
youth groups right when I think

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:32.386
thank you for clarification I

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.588
think that is true. And now we

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:38.792
have. There is light- father

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:40.661
Michael Griffin Johnson Baldwin

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:41.195
park that is very open to

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.496
supporting- communities he

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:44.465
doesn't care about you know

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:45.065
what date and finance and he

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:48.269
sees. Our people as people and

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.905
I think that that message needs

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:51.505
to get across that no matter

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:54.441
what it is or who you you you

are- the support as- well

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.812

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:03.117

believe that we're all children

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:18.432

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.638
and we're supposed to be

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:28.542
supporting. Each other but

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.109
thank you the clarification.

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:34.748
Any. Yes also monitor share on

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.517
part of my story and I could I

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.485
totally- connect with which is

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:40.454
that earlier about- is Tony

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.389
I've been this inherit it and

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:42.957
also based on what she said

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.458
based on religion- to begin

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.493
with- my mother- I transition

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.127
at the age of six sixteen years

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.829
old. US of a topic graduated

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:50.564
from high school I was over the

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:52.700
limit of the trans gender male

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.835
nature on. The one and by the

01:37:54.902 --> 01:38:00.674
way. And my era was the

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:01.242
eighties so the eighties era

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.243
was very difficult not only at

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:04.645
the aids epidemic- I did want

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.246
to have to do to survive not

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.914
only based on my education but

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:08.882
then could not in I guess I was

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:10.718
blessed. That even though I

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:14.321
did. A lot of sex work that's

01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:14.822
why advocate a lot of it

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.523
because I've been there I

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.124
walked in their shoes. And I

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:20.494
know what it's like to be in

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:24.732
their shoes- not only what they

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.467
have become a hate crime but

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:30.971
they've got that on your- neck.

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:31.505
Update all the years I've

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:34.608
started doing that. I was also

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.677
an escort for over ten years I

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.679
did what I have to do to you to

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.381
make my aunt's me I travel to

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:40.981
the whole United States making

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:42.583
a lot of money I'm would deny

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:44.785
what I did because- being. And

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:48.322
I'm not ashamed of it because.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:48.956
Doing the things that I did in

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:49.556
the past. That's what makes me

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:52.359
the person that I am now. To

01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:52.960
advocate and to look. For my

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.662
community or my other siblings

01:38:54.728 --> 01:39:00.501
and. And like when my father

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:03.470
passed away in the year two

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:04.571
thousand I already knew he

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:05.239
passed away a belt hammer thing

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:06.740
partners is disease so through

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:10.511
that. One wasn't able to

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:12.479
recognize why was I realized

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:16.417
that I lost my father. And my

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:17.017
father loved to meet my father

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:17.618
never laid a hand that me on

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:20.487
the contrary he encouraged me

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:21.021
to get higher education.

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.890
Because he said I already know

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.291
the path you're heading so I

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:26.527
advise you to try to get as

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:27.061
much education as you can

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.862
because that's the only in this

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.831
one empower you and left you.

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.766
Because the government can take

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.568
your material things the way

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.303
you might wind up in chaplain

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:40.607
president xterra but one thing

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:41.208
they can. Never take away from

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.676
you is your knowledge. And

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:47.014
through that I was blessed to

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.649
live in and to have a father

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.351
like that and once he passed

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.686
away right away I really knew

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:53.320
was going to inherit it in my

01:39:53.387 --> 01:39:56.590
mother disinherited means not

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.157
only for the simple fact of

01:39:57.224 --> 01:40:00.494
being why am. And learned to

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.763
improper myself and like I told

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.433
her you live your life I live

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.669
my life I won lift my truth we

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:14.641
only live one. And. It's up to

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.343
you but if you accept that or a-

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.545
get but I'm not going to be

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:19.079
miserable while you being

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:22.583
happy. So with that we just

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.183
live my truth and just let me

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:26.520
be white one. So and also on

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:28.422
top of that- we had a very

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:30.424
wonderful successful program.

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:32.292
That was funded by the federal

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:32.893
government which is found for

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.461
grant which was one of our

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:38.432
biggest grant. Fourteen Johnson

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:42.202
are seeking safety pro. And

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:44.405
they're seeking safety program.

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:46.473
It was supposed to be for three

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.040
years we started late but

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.776
within the two years that we

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:50.911
have that program we named it

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:52.646
project work have you E. R. K.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.815
which it stands for working in

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.517
power it resilient and

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.619
knowledgeable. And it was only

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:00.587
for transgender women of color

01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:01.221
if we have been living in or

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.656
experiencing trauma high risk

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.725
for HIV and aids and drug and

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:08.395
alcohol abuse. I raise the bar

01:41:08.462 --> 01:41:10.764
as the FAP because a lot of

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.666
organizations we have had.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:16.570
Grant in that program. A three

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.171
year grant they were able to.

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:20.374
Get twenty thirty individuals

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:22.309
to finish and graduate program.

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.478
I raise the bar and I had over

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:24.978
two hundred individuals

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:26.780
graduate my congratulations.

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:30.384
And after they would graduate

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:30.984
from my program not only with

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.619
the receipt a certificate. And

01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:34.655
a certificate. Opened up

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.557
employment opportunities for a

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:40.427
lot of mine. Graduates for HIV

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:41.028
and aids counselling and role

01:41:41.094 --> 01:41:46.567
in all. And en even though a

01:41:46.633 --> 01:41:47.167
lot of them were undocumented

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:48.402
and the successfully completed

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:50.571
at they were able to use that

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:54.374
to get political five. Thank

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:54.942
you. Thank you and with that

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.410
dumb if there's no other

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.545
questions or comments- I want

01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:00.547
to thank you again for your

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.249
participation in really-

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.785
hopefully we can- do what we

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:08.555
talked about as being more

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:09.156
awareness to domestic violence

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:18.665
yes. Such. I guess some

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:20.234
detective Paula and so it it

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.769
officer Rodriguez I am maybe I

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:26.540
got a little lost so. Domestic

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:30.444
abuse is that considered.

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.379
Demeanor a felony I got a

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:32.813
little lost with the

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.450
terminology I'm sorry. Well I

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.485
can try and- help but it

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:40.621
depends on the on the fence and

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:48.462
officer gas. Please I'm sorry.

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:50.464
The difference there's two

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.232
differences of misdemeanors

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:52.799
where there is no visible

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:56.470
injuries and up Allen is where

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:58.238
there is visible injuries so

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:00.574
the that's what differentiates

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:04.411
those. That's basically it.

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:20.394
Okay

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:24.498
. And I heard and no longer.

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:34.374
They have a cell phone. People

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:48.755
are. Well. The mystic violence

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:52.693
Los okay. Thank you and thank

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:54.661
you for that question because

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.363
it is important to- add to

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.432
differentiate and I think- I

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.434
officer how may have mentioned

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.469
that sometimes you know the

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:03.103
person that bad instigates the

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.638
fight doesn't necessarily

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:06.540
always become- the person that-

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:10.310
is held responsible because you

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:12.212
know obviously we all are no.

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:14.581
That some of these

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:15.182
relationships they knew which

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:18.385
by as to push and so they start

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:18.986
instigating so that they can

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.487
get some reaction and that's

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:22.589
how people get in trouble. But

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:26.526
I think you know the fact is

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:27.127
that they've been doing this

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:28.528
for a while at this not the

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:30.464
first offense and as as you

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.666
stated that he not ex what

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:34.334
times said before somebody

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:36.603
actually decides to leave cell

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:38.639
throw those are those both

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:40.807
times they may be you know a

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:41.341
few years it may be twenty

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:44.244
something you before the- the

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:46.513
fact is that you already know

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.315
how to get to them and the

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:50.317
dynamics have already been

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:52.552
built. You instigate- in order

01:44:52.619 --> 01:44:53.053
to get you know whatever

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.425
reaction so I think important-

01:44:58.492 --> 01:45:02.529
in terms of detectors five

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:04.364
posted this on my Facebook page

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:10.837
are. Fast so you by check on

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:12.239
some file on this server. No

01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:18.278
Sir I. The for posting it is-

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:18.845
somebody on my pages saying

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:20.280
that I'm only focusing. I'm

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:20.881
victims what about those that

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.382
have been falsely accused now I

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:22.916
I'm not going to respond

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:23.550
because it'll be a long little

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:24.551
conversation- but I think the

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:28.388
problem is that- yes there

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.657
there are instances of you know

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.659
accusing. Others and not

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.528
necessarily having enough

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.763
evidence to prosecute but the

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:37.364
fact of the matter is that I

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.934
need to we need to focus on on

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:41.435
what's happening now the

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:42.335
statistics are are.

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:46.339
Overwhelming that we have so

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:47.007
many people that are victims of

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.608
domestic violence at all as you

01:45:48.675 --> 01:45:50.711
know the victims have abusers

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:54.548
and so there's Tom on both

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.383
sides it's not just the

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.950
domestic violence victim but

01:45:57.017 --> 01:46:02.489
the abuser the aggressor also

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:02.989
has to aye and so we're

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:04.758
dealing. Is that we get a

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.727
handle on letter don't try to.

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.762
Figure out who's being accused

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:12.299
of falsely etcetera etcetera so

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.434
you know there's only so much

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:15.035
that we are capable of doing

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:16.503
but what they did I'm made it a

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.572
night I'm sure it does- senator

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:22.476
Susan ruby is also committed to

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:28.415
trying to at least make. Some

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:28.982
make some headway and assist

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:32.319
programs. I'm hoping that.

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:34.488
Where where is the- believe

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:36.189
transit into getting more more

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:36.823
funding from the state so again

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:37.424
I want to thank you for your

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:38.024

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:38.625
other questions my staff is

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:39.259
available I'm available but the

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:39.860

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:40.594
are available to at minimum

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.662
exchange cards so that we on

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:44.765
the that can leave here and

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.399
know who to call if we need

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.033
something which is a sense or

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.335
whatever it may be. So thank

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.470

Covina for hosting us and- I

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:56.409

victory for all of our
