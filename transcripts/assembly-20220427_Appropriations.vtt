01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:23.984
QUESTION JAAP- I THINK. SO THE

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:26.887
ACLU IS AGAINST THIS I THINK

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.589
MISTAKENLY SO. ARE THERE

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.724
CLAIMING IT CREATES A NEW CRIME

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:33.060
WHICH COURSE WOULD ADD COSTS. I

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:35.563
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE-

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.832

ENFORCEMENT OF AN EXISTING CRIME

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:04.859
AND I THEREFORE THINK THAT THE

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:07.728
ACLU IS WRONG IN THINKING THAT

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.597
