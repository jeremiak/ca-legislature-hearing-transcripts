ONE AND I SHE'S HERE BRIGHT AND EARLY READY TO GO. ARE YOU PREPARED TO BEGIN. I AM READY CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES MA'AM WE CAN. THEY ARE ABLE GOOD MORNING AGAIN MERRY WATCH NOT BE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MNAGED HEALTHCARE. I'M I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENTS PROVIDES DEBRIS FOR OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL RELATED TO CHILDREN IN YOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. DID THE DEPARTMENT HAS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS INITIATIVE BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A REQUEST FOR RESOURCES- OUR ROLE IS REALLY TO ENSURE ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEROES HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL. ANTHER SCHOOL AFFILIATED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER FACILITIES. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO COMMERCIAL AND ROWLEY'S. THE PROPOSED STATUTORY CHANGES OUT A NUMBER OF NEW REQUIREMENTS TO HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PLANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED AT SCHOOLS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAN HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL OR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. IF THE SCHOOL DOES NOT PROVIDE SERVICES ON CAMPUS THIS WOULD INCLUDE SERVICES LINKED TO THE SCHOOL. SUCH AS SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO STREAMLINE THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS AND REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON SCHOOLS WE ARE PROPOSING THAT HEALTH PLANS WILL REIMBURSE THE SCHOOLS. ARE SERVICES PROVIDED STUDENTS AT THE GREATER OF THE CONTRACTED RATE THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL FACILITY. FOR THE RATE SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDIC CALIBRATES. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY FORM OF CARSHARING. SUCH AS COPAYS COINSURANCE OR DEDUCTIBLES. HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO DENY A CLAIM. IF THEY REASONABLY BELIEVE THE STUDENT WAS NOT ENROLLED IN A HEALTH PLAN THE SERVICES WERE NEVER PERFORMED OR THEY WERE NOT PROVIDED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PROPERLY LICENSED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DETAILS THAT WE WILL NEED TO WORK THROUGH BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC SERVICES THE HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE. IN THE COMING YEARS WE WILL COORDINATE WITH THE HEALTH PLANS DEPARTMENT OF YOUR SERVICES. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE AND SCHOOLS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS INITIATIVE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PLANTS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE WILL ULTIMATELY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS- MONITOR CAN. DRUG OVERSIGHT PROCESS PROCESSES SUCH AS MEDICAL SERVICE FINANCIAL EXAMS AND MONITORING COMPLAINTS TO THE- HOPE CENTER. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AS YOU NOTED THIS IS A- THIS IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS AS WERE ALL TRYING TO PROVIDE A MORMON MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. AND TO OUR KIDS IN SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AS SEAMLESSLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH VARIOUS FUNDING STREAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CHILD BASICALLY IS LEFT BEHIND ON THIS. BERMAN OF- NOT ILLEGAL PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HIS YOU KNOW WITH THEL. A. ON THIS ISSUE- JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS HERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL APPEARS TO REPRESENT A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE- THAT ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER PROPOSALS WITHIN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE- WOULD LIKELY COME WITH ADDITIONAL ONGOING COSTS ESPECIALLY GIVEN LIMITATIONS ON- PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AS THE AS THE- THE ADMINISTRATION JUST NOTED- THE LEGISLATURE JUST MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE TRAILER BILL PROCESS- WOULD ALLOW FOR SORT OF SUFFICIENT LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATION ON THIS ITEM OR- WHETHER WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER THIS ITEM AND I'M SORT OF IN THE POLICY PROCESS. THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HAPPY HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. AND I WOULD GUESS A DIRECTOR BUT- IT'S ALSO WE'RE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH INFORMATION YET AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD- MORE INFORMATION WILL NEED TO BE. PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT. THAT BEFORE. ON ON NOT. A NEW KIND OF ROLES A NEW FOLKS. PROVIDING RESOURCES AND HELP. SO AS WE GO FORWARD WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS GOING TO BE JUST A BUDGET ASK OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE MOVED A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN. AS WE DEVELOP THE POLICY. ON ALL OF OUR GOALS I THINK ARE VERY ALIGNED AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO TAKE YOUNG PEOPLE. NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE AND NO MATTER THEIR PAYMENT SOURCE. BUT IT'S JUST A IN THE POLICY HOW OF THAT I THINK THAT THERE STILL ARE SOME QUESTIONS. AND OF. A GIFT. CANNOT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT GIVES US. RAY SOME. ISSUES THAT WE PERHAPS NEED TO. FIGURE OUT IN THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS BUT I THINK OVERALL CONCEPTUALLY IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE.

AUG TO OUT REACH SPECIFICALLY TO OUR BENEFICIARIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CONTINUITY- AND THAT- ANY COMPLEX CARE ALL WHO THAT IS UNDERWAY IS CONTINUED. WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION- QUESTION WAS POSED STIR PALM WHAT WE DON'T DO WE AN UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT MAY HAVE LED TO LOWER- UTILIZATION OF BROWN'S BECAUSE WE ARE WE DON'T ON STARTING A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGED WITH THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO ENCOURAGE THEM IN TERMS OF OUTREACH- YOU DID ACTIVITIES ALL ALSO OF ALLOWED THEM TO A GREATER DEGREE OF PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY THE WHOLE BECAUSE IT MIGHT. CHANGE THE OUTCOMES- BUT- AS WE OBSERVE OBSERVED IN. ALLEN TO YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN- UTILIZATION FOR ON THE ANNUAL DENTAL VISITS FOR CHILDREN BOB WAS SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER IN DENTAL MANAGED CARE THAN FEE FOR SERVICE ALL PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. WAS EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN DOUBLE MANAGED CARE AND THEN IN THE NOVEMBER TO OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY. OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS THE LAST. QUARTER FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALL FOR INFORMATION THE PATTERN CONTINUES ON AND THIS IS CONSISTENT- SO- LET ME STOP THERE AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I CAN RESPOND TO. HELLO I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COREY ISSUED A GAME WITH THE L. A. L. WE BROUGHT UP AN ANALYSIS OF THIS ISSUE WHEN IT WAS- PROPOSED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- AND REYES NO MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL- GIVEN YOU KNOW LOWER UTILIZATION DATA INTO MANAGED CARE AND THAT WAS- THAT WAS PRESENT- AND SO ASSUMING YOU KNOW NO FOR NO FURTHER REVISED DATA INDICATING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND DENTAL MANAGED CARE- WE WOULD SORT OF HAVE NO ISSUES TO RAISE WITH THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL. THANK YOU OKAY. THE CDVA. THANK YOU HAVE A PRE SHEET- THE PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY I HAVE SHARED THE CONCERNS ABOUT LOWER UTILIZATION FACT GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHEN I WAS IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COME OUT THAT OUR FIRST FIVE COMMISSION HAD PERFORMED- SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF WHERE. THIS IS COMING FROM BUT I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE THIS PROPOSAL AND I THINK MIGHT MY REMARKS IS THAT MY QUESTIONS OF PERHAPS MORE TARGET TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY I KNOW THIS IS THE SECOND ROUND LOS ANGELES. I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCES- SO FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE- THE EXPECTED. SAVINGS ARE YOU PROJECTING IT NOW TWENTY TWO. MILLION A REDUCTION AND- EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY- WHERE IS THAT TWENTY TWO MILLION COMING FROM SO FOR EXAMPLE. I HAVE C. SET THE RATES FOR THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLAN IF YOU SWITCH TO FEE FOR SERVICE ARE YOU EXPECTING IS THAT PROJECT IS THAT SAVINGS COMING FROM- UTILIZATION AS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MANAGED CARES HAVE NOW DO YOU PROJECTING AN INCREASE IN. REALISATION TO THE STATE AVERAGE OR ABOVE- AND SO WHEN YOU DID YOUR CALCULATION OF THE SAVINGS IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT- SO HE JUST PERHAPS SPECIFY A LITTLE MORE HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE TWENTY TWO MILLION IN SAVINGS AND WHAT WHAT'S PROJECTED UTILIZATION- IF ONCE YOU TRANSFER EVERYONE TO FEE FOR SERVICE THAT. YOU USE AND CREATING THIS PROJECTION. WELL THERE WILL ONLY BE SORT OF SIX MONTHS OR AFTER THE TRANSIT AND- BUDGET YEAR- THERE'S SORT OF A- UTILIZATION IS WHAT SORT OF SIGNIFICANTLY TAMPERED WITH FOR THAT SIX MONTH PERIOD SO REALLY WHAT DO YOU TO SAVINGS REPRESENTS- JUST THE SORT OF THE DELTA. DENTAL ACOSTA OF PROGRAM IT IS OUR GOAL TO HAVE ON BOTH COUNTIES SACRAMENTO COURSE IS MANDATORY HELLO- AND- BUT WITH THE KNOCKED OUT RIGHT AWAY WITH IT WOULD IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY UNLIMITED OFFICE. WHERE IS OF LOS ANGELES IS OFTEN ALL SO BUT OUR GOAL IS TO IS TO TRY TO YOU KNOW SMOOTH IT OUT ON OVER HELLO OF EUROPE TOO SO THAT WE GET TO. ON STATEWIDE AVERAGES SO THE SAVINGS IS ESSENTIALLY. THE APPLICATION RIGHT. OKAY AND THEN JUST THE OTHER I GUESS IN TERMS BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU NEGOTIATE THE RATE WITH THE DENTAL PLANS MANAGED CARE PLANS SO- SO SOME OF THAT. SO IN TERMS OF THE RATE WHICH IS NEGOTIABLE TO DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLAN SO IT BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING THE SAME UTILIZATION RATE BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S THE SAME HERE SO YOU DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY IF IT'S MIDWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. DEBT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT DISRUPTION AND WHAT THAT MAY DO. BUT THEN- BUT THEN YOU'RE ALSO SAYING THAT IN YOUR NEGOTIATION ON THE DOW MANAGED CARE PLANS BASICALLY- THAT- THAT YOU'RE- GIVING THEM. A HIGHER- RATE. RELATIVE TO- IN. IT WHEN WINDOWS WRITTEN NEGOTIATED. YEAH I MEAN TO BE HONEST. THE RATES WATERSHED JUST AS LONG BEFORE MY TIME ALONG. THAT THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT BUT WAS FANTASY CORD CUTTING HAIR COORDINATION BE INCREASED AND YOU LET ME KNOW PREVENTIVE REALIZE NATION MEMBERS THROUGH AN INVESTMENT YEAH THE STRUCTURE. AND- IT THE OFFICERS THAT HASN'T OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER THING QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT IN SACRAMENTO- THERE'S ACTUALLY- SACRAMENTO COUNTY- PARTNERED WITH THE DENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND DOING A PROGRAM CALLED EARLY SMILES. SACRAMENTO WAS SO THE DEALER COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND SO THAT. YOU KNOW THE REACHED OUT TO OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN AND TO DO DENTAL SCREENINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS- IS THAT I MEAN SO THEY'RE NOT THESE ARE VISITS SAID IN A DENTAL OFFICE IS THAT COUNTED IN THE UTILIZATION RATES ARE I MEAN HOW HOW AND IN WHAT HAPPENS THAT PROGRAM IF WE GO TO FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE SO I JUST YOU KNOW WE- WILL LOSE SOMETHING HERE. THAT WE'RE NOT COUNTING AND SO THAT'S JUST SO THAT THAT'S A SO THAT THE ISSUE. I MEAN STATEWIDE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE OPERATE THE SMILE CALIFORNIA RICH CAMPAIGNS AND- BURKE FOR EXACTLY THE SAME PURPOSE- AND FRANKLY TV CAMPAIGNS IN SACRAMENTO BASICALLY UTILIZED THESE ARE STATE WIDE SMILE- MATERIALS- SO. ARE YOU I DON'T SEE A- YOU KNOW ME JUST THERE ARE SO SUGGEST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE HE'S OUTSIDE. THERE SO YOU SAYING THAT THE EARLIEST. SACRAMENTO PROGRAM. WE'LL STILL CONTINUE. WHEN THE SWITCH TO THE FOR SERVICE HAPPENS SO THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS THE COUNTY BE SURE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NO IT WOULDN'T LET ME CLARIFY IT WHAT WILL BE IN ITS PLACE AS THE SMILE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW WILL CERTAINLY FOCUS IN TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IS. NO CONTINUES AND THEN THERE BEEN CONVERSATIONS THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY ABOUT THIS YET I DON'T THINK SO OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE YEAH I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY CONVERSATIONS EITHER SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT I HOPE THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED PRIOR TO ANY ACTION- BECAUSE WE WOULD HATE TO LOSE THAT. PROGRAM OR SOME ITERATION THAT PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE DOING OUTREACH TO FAMILIES AND GETTING THEM PLUGGED INTO- DENTAL CARE ACTUALLY THERE YOU MAKE REFERRALS FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IF THEY'RE UNINSURED AS WELL SO- SO I HOPE THERE WILL BE CONVERSATIONS WITH- THE FOLKS AT. IN MY CERTAINLY MY DISTRICT MY COUNTY ABOUT THIS BEFORE HE DESTRUCT THE PROGRAM LIKE THAT. JUST OVER IMPORTANT. SO I MEAN WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. COMMITTED THAT WE WILL KNOW. BECAUSE PART OF THE THIS TRANSITION WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH OKAY SACRAMENTO COUNTY HEALTH HELP TO BE SOME CONVERSATION BEFORE MAKING A DECISION SO- WE START A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THAT SO- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO HEAR BACK FROM MY LOCAL FOLKS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL SURE THAT WILL CONTINUE- IF THIS IS A DECISION THAT'S BEING. DECIMATED. OKAY THE INSTRUCTOR. OKAY OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. DO WE HAVE ON OUR SITE. WE NEED TO.

FOR A FACT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE- SO TO GET STARTED WE DO HAVE A- RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD- UPDATE FOR OUR- AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ESTIMATE. THE MAY REVISION IS REFLECTING AN OVERALL DECREASE OF ELEVEN POINT NINE. MILLION A DROP EXPENDITURE AT THE WORKING LOCAL SUBSTANCE. AND THE DECREASE YEARS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER PROJECTED- MEDICATION EXPENDITURES FOR MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS. AND THEN AND BUDGET YEAR WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR DECREASE OF THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION IN ATOPIC SPEND INSURER FORTY FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. AND THE PRIMARY REASON IS THE SAME REASON BEING EIGHTY PROJECTED DECREASE MEDICATION EXPENDITURE FOR MEDICATION ONLY FINANCE. THANK YOU PAUSE THERE- IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ON OUR I'M NAY REVISION PROJECTIONS AS MISS PEDICURE EVERYTHING. NO MA'AM THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING. THIS TIME I'M SURE. NOW OKAY AND WHAT AND CAN YOU JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT OF A BAR YOU THINK THOSE ARE GOING DOWN. YEAH SO- WE ARE ACTUALLY ADJUSTING OUR ESTIMATES WITH MORE REAL TIME- DATA THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE ONE TO NOVEMBER ESTIMATE. AND SO- ARE. UPDATED DATA SHOWS THAT- YOU MAY HAVE A SLIGHT DECREASE WE'RE STILL REALLY TRYING TO GAUGE WHAT HE- A POTENTIAL DRIVER BEHIND THAT IS WHETHER- EAT PANDEMIC HAD ANY INFLUENCE ON OUR- VIDAK AND ROMANTIC BUT IT'S- IT'S- TYPICAL THAT WE SEE SOME SORT OF AN ADJUSTMENT FOR. THE MAY REVISION AND REALLY WHEN WE LOOK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR- OVERALL BUDGET AND CLIENT CASELOAD IT'S RAW IT'S A RELATIVELY MINIMAL- UPDATE. HI I MEAN IT DIDN'T HAVE THE PROGRAM'S BEEN AS A AS I GUESS WE CAN SAVE THEM ASSEMBLY USE OR VIBRANT BUT AS AS A VIGOROUS AS USUAL JUST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND MAYBE PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES HAVE BEEN. OTHERWISE FOCUSED. RIGHT SO FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM WE TOOK A NUMBER OF STEPS EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO MEDICATION- I'LL BE PROVIDED- CLIENTS WITH LG ELIGIBILITY EXPANSIONS. ARE WE ALSO PUT A NUMBER OF PROCESSES IN PLACE TO FACILITATE REMOTE ENROLLMENT. SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT PERHAPS ANY IMPACT TO THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S RELATIVELY- ANYTHING HONEST ARE DIFFERENT THE OKAY. WE WANT ISSUE NUMBER TWO. DID YOU WANT ME TO COVER THE PROPER SYSTEMS PROGRAM TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL YES YES OKAY PERFECT- SO JUST VERY QUICKLY WE ARE PROPOSING A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE- TO ALLOW THE PRACTICE SYSTEMS PROGRAM TO PAY FOR IT SPECIFIED ANCILLARY SERVICES. OR PERSON WHO'S DISPENSED WORK BRITISH PROPER PAT I'M PURSUING TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE EXISTING LAW WHICH IS CODIFIED IN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SPECIFIES THAT IN ORDER FOR THE OFFICE OF AIDS TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF PREP AND PAP. PERSONS MUST POSSESS OR OBTAIN A PRESCRIPTION I'M SO I'M SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY NINE AND TWENTY NINETEEN MODIFIED BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. I'M AUTHORIZING A PHARMACIST TO DISPENSE ORPHANAGE PROPER PATH TO PERSONS WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION AND- THIS IN A DIFFERENT WE CREATED A SMALL CONFLICT BETWEEN- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES. I'M AS THE WORD PRESCRIPTION IS DEFINED VERY DISTINCTLY FROM FURNITURE DISPENSED- MEANING BACK THE PROPER SYSTEMS PROGRAM WOULD NOT TECHNICALLY BE FOLLOWING THE LETTER OF THE LAW TO BE PAID FOR SERVICES FOR PURCHASE MAP WIRES- PROVIDED PROPER BACK PURSUANT TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SO THIS IS REALLY HARMONIZED. WHAT WE KNOW IS YOUNG TALENTS ARE BETWEEN THESE TWO STATUTES. INCREASE ACCESS. OKAY THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE ALL RIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON TO NUMBER. TWO NUMBER ONLY DO YOU WANT TO START FOR ISSUE NUMBER TWO. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS RICHARD ONLY FROM THE GENETIC DISEASE SCREENING PROGRAM I'M THE DIVISION DIRECTOR. AND POSITION NUMBER TWO IS A PROPOSAL TO REMOVE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR H. HUMILITY DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN. IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE- GOING BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY THERE'S BEEN A STATE REQUIREMENT FOR PROVIDERS TO REPORT R. H. DISEASE STARTED PARDON. BUT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ROUTINE TESTING OF OUR EIGHT STATUS AND USE OF THE THERAPY KNOWN AS ROGAN HAS BECOME THE CLINICAL STANDARD OF CARE. SO WHAT WAS ONCE A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN HAS FORTUNATELY BECOME A RARE EVENT. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE ONLY STATES THAT COLLECTS DATA ON CASES AND SUSPECT CASES OF OURS DISEASE. THE ORIGINAL INTENT INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN A CHIU STATEWIDE AND NATIONALLY. AND CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS WILL CONTINUE. THIS CHANGE COULD ALLOW CITY PH AND BIRTH HOSPITAL STAFF TO FOCUS SURVEILLANCE RESOURCES SOME MORE IMPORTANT CAUSES SUCH AS PREVENTING OTHER EMERGING ISSUES. THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. THANKS FOR. THE VIOLATE JUST HOW MANY CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PAST YEAR TEN YEARS. YEAH IT'S- THAT USED TO BE- WELL OVER- C. WHICH OF MY FIGURES HERE WE USED TO HAVE- HUNDREDS OF CASES BUT- WHAT THE MORTALITY WAS ONCE- FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND NOW IT'S LESS THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. OKAY THERE ARE STILL A FIFTEEN ATTIRED EXPECTED ACTUALLY. YEAH IT'S A RARE EVENT THOUGH COMPARED TO WHAT IT USED TO BE- YEAH I'M DEFINITELY AS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW THAT BUT THOSE CURIOUS AS TO HOW MANY WE ACTUALLY ARE GETTING EVEN NOW BUT YEAH MOST OF THE CASES ARE REPORTED TO US OR ACTUALLY SUSPECT CASES- AND NOT THROUGH CONFLICT DISEASE OKAY ALL RIGHT THANKS. HI THANK YOU THAN NOT MOVING ON. OKAY SO- THIS IS RICHARD ONLY STONE NEXT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS- ARE MANY REVISIONS FOR THE GSP ESTIMATE. AND AS A REMINDER TO THE REMOTE AUDIENCE- ARE BUDGET SUPPORTS ACTIVITIES OF TWO MAJOR PROGRAMS. OUR FIRST THE MANDATORY CALIFORNIA NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM KNOWN AS AND THE US. BEYOND THE STATE WIDE VOLUNTARY CALIFORNIA PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS PNS. ARME REVISIONS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY TRENDS IN LIVE BIRTHS WHICH HAVE DECREASED NUMEROUS REASONS STATISTICS AND ARE PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO TREND DOWNWARD. THESE TRENDS WILL AFFECT BOTH AND THE S. AND P. AND ALSO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMBINED EFFECT. ON BOTH PROGRAMS TOGETHER. SO FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- IN THE MAY REVISION WE'RE NOW ESTIMATING ARE REQUESTED EXENDITURE AUTHORITY. AT ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY POINT FIVE MILLION. WHICH IS A VERY SLIGHT NOT CHANGED PARTLY DUE TO INCREASED EXPENDITURES ATTRIBUTED TO ON AND THEN BURSARY. BOB FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THERE IS A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE MAY REVISION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY. BRINGING THE TOTAL REQUESTED AUTHORITY FOR FY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWO. ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. AS EXPECTED WITH THE CONTINUING DROP IN THE BURST RATE WE CONTINUE TO SEE A DROP IN CASELOAD AND REVENUE. AND WE'RE ADJUSTING OUR CURRENT YEAR REVENUE DOWNWARD BY THREE POINT THREE MILLION AND THE BUDGET YOUR DOLLARS OR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. HOWEVER REVENUES ARE STILL SUFFICIENT TO COVER EXPENDITURES. ARE FINE CONDITION CONTINUES TO REMAIN STRONGER THAN EXPECTED BALANCE OF 4% BY THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. CHANGES IN THE MAY REVISION WITH OUR CELL FREE DNA BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND AS A REMINDER LABORATORY COST INCREASES AND FEE STRUCTURE CHANGES FIVE SEP THOSE COSTS WILL BEGIN IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DON'T SEE L. A. O.

THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND IT HAS EXPOSED SIGNIFICANT GAPS. IN THE ABILITY OF CDPH AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. YEARS OF LIMITED FUNDING OR FUNDING CUTS HAVE DISMANTLED THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING RESOURCES AND STAFF BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES THE EROSION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE NATION. HAS RESULTED IN A LACK OF TRAINED PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE ANTIQUATED DATA AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS. INCREASE CATEGORICAL FUNDING ALLOWING LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH STATE. AND ITS COMMUNITIES. AND ONE TIME FUNDING INJECTIONS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC EMERGENCIES WITH NO LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA FACES ENORMOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES INCLUDING RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH INEQUITIES HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY. INCREASING MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE PRUDENT SECURITY. AN AGING POPULATION CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS INCREASED MEDICAL CARE COSTS THREATS TO HELP THEIR HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND NOW THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TOO FAST THE EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND IDENTIFY RESOURCES NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC'S THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS LOCALS. THE KEY TO PROTECTING AND IMPROVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH LIES IN A STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED BY ADEQUATE AND STABLE FUNDING. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST BE READY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES THIS REQUIRES ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICAL DATA SOURCES ROBUST LABORATORY CAPACITY PREPAREDNESS OF POLICY PLANNING CAPACITY MODERNIZE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS STRONG COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMMUNICATIONS FIRST STRATEGIC HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIPS. AND A BREATH AND DEPTH OF SUSTAINED EXPERT STAFF WE MUST THINK NOT ONLY SHORT TERM NOT ONLY THE SHORT TERM NEEDS OF THE PANDEMIC BUT CONSIDER THE LONG TERM READINESS OF OUR STATE AND HOW AN IMPROVED BASELINE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CAN HELP WHETHER THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATE UNDERTAKE THIS REVIEW AND TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS ADEQUATELY RESOURCE. WE WILL ASSESS ONGOING WORKFORCE NEEDS LABORATORY CAPACITY CRITICAL RESOURCES AND WILL ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERS AND KEY STAFF. OF ALL OF THIS. BASIC STEP AND COMMITMENT TOWARDS BUILDING A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM CDPH WILL LEVERS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

I GUESS WE COULD GO THEM BACKWARDS OR I DON'T KNOW IF ELLIE- HASN'T ARE YOU HAVE SOME SORT MANAGER WHETHER. WE SHOULD. PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER OR ARE. WHATEVER YOU WISH BUT I WOULD MAKE AN OBSERVATION THOSE THREE SEEM TO BE ALL INTERLINKED OKAY. BUT SINCE HE JUST DID NUMBER EIGHT. MISTAKE ARE YOU PREPARED TO REMARK ON NUMBER EIGHT. I AM FOCUSED BUT WE JUST GRABBED THIS AND KEEP IT CLEAN AND BRIGHT THERE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN I'M SORT OF HEADED FROM THE L. A. O. WE JUST HAVE A FEW A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR SO I WE NOTE THAT THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSE REVIEW MENTIONS THREE KEY ASPECTS OF THE REVIEW. THE FIRST IS TO ASSESS THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH INTERESTS. I'M SORRY THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE SECOND IS TRUE VIEW. IS CENTRAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND- I NEEDS AND RESOURCES AND THEN THE THIRD IS TO ASSESS ROOT CAUSES OF THE DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COBIT- AND THE PROPOSAL STATES THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO INFORM. A. B. A PROPOSAL OUT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I OTHER YOU KNOW SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS REVIEWS SO FOR EXAMPLE% WHAT EXACTLY WILL THE PROCESS BE HAPPY WILL BE AND WHAT WILL THE DEIVERABLES BE ASIDE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND THEN WHAT WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE SPENT ON ASIDE FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF- PROCURING A VENDOR TO HELP CONDUCT THE RADIO. AND SO. YET BREEDING AGAIN HAVE A FEW KEY POINTS- FIRST WE KNOW THAT THE TIMING OF THIS- BUT THESE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL THAT OUR OUR REVIEW OF THE COMPANY EIGHTEEN RESPONSE. REALLY APPEAR KEEN TO AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW. AN AFTER ACTION REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A PUBLIC HEALTH EVENTS- JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE- AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CONDUCTED AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW JUST FIVE- WITHIN JUST FIVE MONTHS- IT'S REALLY HELPED MEANT TO HELP THE KEY PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS ACTIONS THEY TOOK TO RESPOND TO THE TO THE EMERGENCY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT WELL WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO I AM BASED ON ON THIS- WEEK WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW IN THE CASE OF CODE NINETEEN IS BOTH CRITICAL AND VERY IPORTANT. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS MUCH BROADER DESPITE THE VERY AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. I'M NOT ONLY WOULD THEY BE ASSESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO COVET BUT THEY WOULD ALSO BE SEEKING TAKE ANSWER A SET OF COMPLEX QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE NEEDS. AS WELL AS ASSESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES WHICH WERE EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. ANOTHER POINT WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME DUPLICATION WITH ANOTHER STUDY PROPOSED WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND THE AGENCY HAS PROPOSED ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO CONDUCT A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERVIEW INTERSECTION OF COVETED NINETEEN AND- DISPARITIES. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT LENS THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DUPLICATION AND I'M BETWEEN THE TWO EFFORTS. I'M SO THE ISSUES WE WOULD RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING SO FIRST- WE'D SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER BREAKING- THE REVIEW INTO TWO DIFFERENT STUDIES THE FIRST WOULD BE THE AFTER ACTION REVIEW IT WILL BE DONE QUICKLY IT COULD LIKELY BE DONE IN HOUSE THE COST COULD LIKELY BE ABSORBED- WITHIN THE EXISTING BUDGET- IT COULD HELP WITH NEAR NEAR TERM DECISION MAKING- AND CLOSING SOME OF THE IDENTIFIED GAPS. WE WOULD THEN SUGGEST A MOLD A MORE MULTI YEAR ASSESSMENT TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS WELL AS RESOURCE NEEDS OF BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL WE ALSO WOULD SUGGEST TO TAKE IT EVEN FURTHER AND LOOK AT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. TO HELP- AT HELP DECISION MAKERS FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT- THE DEPARTMENT TO DO. I WOULD SUGGEST CONTRACTING OUT FOR THIS STUDY SOTHAT IT'S AN INDEPENDENT AND UNBIASED ASSESSMENT. THE COST- IT DEPENDS REALLY ON THE SCOPE IT COULD SOMEONE EXCEED THREE THREE MILLION BUT WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE PROBABLY NOT BY A LOT MORE THAN THREE MILLION- AND THEN IN THE MEANTIME THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER TEMPORARY FUNDING TO BOLSTER DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL IS VERY COVERT SPECIFIC RIGHT NOW AND UNLIMITED. AND WHILE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IS UNDER WAY LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE ALONG WITH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THE STAFFING CAPABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND THEN ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETED THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING FUNDING FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BASED ON. SORT OF THE RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AND ANY FUTURE REQUIREMENTS. SO WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT TO ENSURE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS BOTH NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM NEEDS THE LEGISLATURE COULD NOT SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT MAKE THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS DEPENDING ON FINDINGS OF BOTH REVIEWS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. PUBLIC- WELL LOOK YOU'RE GOING TO I WOULD- AND- I WOULD SUGGEST MAYBE WAS. AN ACCIDENT THE PRESENT A NUMBER EIGHT FIRST BUT I THINK- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I THINK IN LIGHT OF WHAT MISS PEGGY SAID AND I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF US WAS BEEN FEELING THERE MAYBE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OR AS MUCH AS THAT WE THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE. GIVEN THE- PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE JUST COME OUT OF AN ARM AND THE ECONOMY WITHOUT THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND THEN WITH THIS FIRST CHANCE WITH THE BUDGET. SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO- A LOOK BACK AND A LOOK FORWARD- AND I THINK I THINK THAT FOR MY REMARKS ARE MORE. AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT WITH MENTAL HEALTH THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF GOOD PLANS FOR GOING FORWARD. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME. URGENCY NOW THAT WE THAT WE MAY BE OVERLOOKING- AND- AND SO I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH MISS PETTICOAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. BUT THEN GOING FORWARD REALLY RE ENVISIONING I THINK WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN CALIFORNIA. IS A IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA- ALL ASPECT PAN IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS BUT THEN I THINK THE BEST THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT. IN THE WORLD. WHAT WE ARE DOING- BUT I THINK ENOUGH. I THINK THAT I THINK WILL WILL WILL COME BACK WITH SOME IDEAS OF OUR OWN. ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE SOME MORE ASSISTANCE. IN A MOTOR THE MORE SHORT TERM. BUT DEPEND. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- SEVERAL QUESTIONS- SO FOR A FIRST OF ALL- YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT AS WE'RE TALKING WITH THIS ITEM THE PROPOSAL IS FOR THREE MILLION FOR OF YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE L. A. AS- ANALYSIS OF THAT BUT THIS IS THE PLAY ALSO THE PLACE AND I MADE REFERENCE ANNIE WE'VE IN SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WILL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE LATER WITH- SEVEN SIX AND SEVEN. IN THIS- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. SO I MEAN AND LET'S AND LET'S NOT PRETEND WE DON'T KNOW THERE ARE PROBLEMS. WE ARE YOU KNOW THEIR PROBLEMS. AND TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR. RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BUDGET YEAR FOR THREE MILLION THAT AND WE'LL GO INTO A GENDER PROPOSAL WHICH WE WON'T DECIDE UNTIL NEXT. JULY ACTUALLY LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND THEN AFTER IMPLEMENTED- I THINK IS THIS DANGEROUS FRANKLY- BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THE BY THE WAY THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT GONE AWAY I MEAN. VERY HOPEFUL THINGS ARE WINDING DOWN BUT IT'S NOT GOING AWAY IN FACT. EXPECT WE HAVE OUTBREAKS OF CODED HERE AND THERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY- NOT. LIKE WHAT WE SAW LAST HOLIDAY YOU KNOW LAST JANUARY BUT- WE WERE IT'S NOT GOING AWAY. AND- SO LET ME JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK WE KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY- AND THEN AGAIN I THINK THE ROLE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY- I. SURE WE CAN REIMAGINE IT BUT- I THINK OF A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT THE ROLE PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER SOCIETY AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN WE EXECUTE ON THAT- I'M NOT SAYING THAT- WE CAN'T MAKE IT BETTER WE CAN'T DO SOME RE IMAGINING BUT- I THINK- INVESTING IN WHAT WE KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOW IS NOT GOING TO BE WASTED. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN AROUND SAY WELL THAT ACTUALLY PUBLIC HEALTH IS NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE. CERTAINLY NOT CONTROL OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES NOT MANAGED YOU KNOW SURVEILLANCE OF CHRONIC DISEASES- LIMITING STDS- YOU KNOW- OVERALL I MEAN THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS THAT- PUBLIC HEALTH WE KNOW WHAT SUPPOSED TO DO. SO MAY JUST GO BACK AND SO FOR EXAMPLE- GOING ON- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY- YEAH SO WE KNOW THAT CAL READY- ESSENTIALLY COLLAPSED MID YEAR- WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE TO VASTLY RAMP UP OUR VACCINE- OR ITS MUSICIAN REGISTRY WHICH BY THE WAY- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S READY TO PROVIDE VERIFICATIONS ARE NOT- BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD. AS WELL- AND- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HOW ROBUST THOSE SYSTEMS ARE AND ALSO HOW WELL ARE WE ABLE TO INTERFACE BETWEEN NOT ONLY OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES WITH THE STATE AND THEIR REGISTRIES BUT ALSO WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS BECAUSE IS SAID TO. WE ERTAINLY HAVE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING A FAX INFORMATION OVER AND THEN INFORMATION BEING MANUALLY ENTERED INTO SYSTEMS AGAIN TYING UP RESOURCES TIME WORK FORCE AT CETERA- BUT IF THOSE ISSUES GONE AWAY OR THEY'RE STILL HERE BECAUSE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY TO ME THINGS WHICH IT'S OFF RIGHT NOW. CENTER PAN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THOSE ISSUES HAVE NOT GONE AWAY WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO GET. EMERGENCY FUNDING FROM THE STATE BUT ALSO FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A LOT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING DOWN IS BEING USED TO ADDRESS THOSE. ISSUES AND SO WE GOT TO COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL THIS ESPECIALLY THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS COMING DOWN SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN USE THAT AND IN A VERY FOCUSED WAY. IT'S A LONGER TERM ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL AND IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE- MORE ASSESSMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE ARGAN ARGAN INC. ARGAN BENEFIT US DOWN YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT OKAY SO AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THIS FUNDS ARE PRIMARILY. RESTRICTED TO KOVIN. RELATED THEY ARE IN A THINK I MEAN THE THAT WE SEE OF THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE WERE USING WERE USING THE COLORS FUNDING TO REALLY TO BUILD OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RESPONSE. YOU KNOW WE'RE BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE THE CAL READY WYCHECK CAL READY HANDLES NOT JUST CULTIVATING HANDLES. READY FOR ALL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THE CARE REGISTRY HANDLES NOT JUST A COVERT FAXING BACKS NATIONS BUT IT HANDLES- VACCINATIONS FOR ALL ALL ALL. ALL THE EXHIBITIONS FOR THE STATE AND SO IT IT'S SORT OF A- A CO BENEFIT OR DUAL PURPOSE WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FUNDING. TO REALLY TO REALLY IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW PART OF IT WE RECOGNIZE IT COST A LOT OF MONEY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WE DO IT RIGHT. WE DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT REALLY LOOKS TO THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE OTHER THING WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. IS HOW WE WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD. IS ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW THE WAY PUBLIC HEALTH WORKS IS THAT WE GET WE GET DATA FROM THE HELP WE GET DATA FROM A LABORATORY AND- HOUSE IS REPORTING TO US TO GO INTO OUR CAL READY. BUT SORT OF THE MODERN APPROACH REALLY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES AND WORKING WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND BEING ABLE TO GET REAL TIME DATA ACROSS THE STATE NOT DEPENDING ON PEOPLE TO REPORT TO US. SO WE HAVE. TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. THAT FUTURE SOLUTION THAT ARE MUCH. EASILY AND APPARENTLY ASK YOU SEE. HE KEEPS WITH ABOUT. AS THE POTTERY HOW. AND CAN WE JUST GO AND DO IT. I MEAN. SORRY ARE YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE TO KEEP THINKING ARE HAVE PEOPLE DO WE HAVE MODELS OF HOW PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT. AND SO WE JUST GO AHEAD I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE READY TO GIVE SOMEONE A YOU KNOW A CONTRACT SOMETHING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. BUT DO WE HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR. BEFORE WE START WORKING ON THIS I MEAN EIGHT BLACK PEOPLE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS I MEAN I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS. A LONG TIME CREE COVE IT SO. CAN WE JUST DO IT. YES I ALSO THE WAY THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT IS A WE- WE'VE WE'VE JUST STARTED PLANNING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS SO WE HAVE WORK GROUPS INVOLVING. HEALTH OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU'RE CORRECT IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS BACK KOBE MAY INCREASE BECAUSE WE'RE OPENING UP THE ECONOMY RIGHT MAYBE MORE TRANSMISSION. NOT EVERYONE IS VACCINATED SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING PLANNING FOR THAT. ROLE SO CONVENE A HIGH LEVEL GROUP. TO START DOING THAT THE MORE DETAILED LONGER TERM PLANNING. AS A WE'RE GONNA BE USING THE EXISTING MONEY THAT'S COMING IN TO DO THAT. AND TO BE PLANNING FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET TO HAVE MORE PERMANENT. FUNDING HAS THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND EMERGENCY FUNDS START GOING AWAY. SO WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY WE'RE WE'RE PLANNING TO MOVE TO MAKKAH MASTERS OUT. OKAY I KNOW YOU CAN'T DISAGREE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YEAR AFTER YEAR. DIRECTOR HAD BUT I I'M GOING TO SAY THAT YOU I THINK YOU CAN. I HAVE CONFIDENCE YOU AND YOUR PARTNERS CAN WORK FASTER THAN HAVING TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR FOR THE NEXT BUDGET- D. HOW MUCH FEDERAL MONEY ARE YOU GETTING FOR THE I. T. RIGHT NOW. AT THAT'S NOT DETAILED ANYWHERE SOME YOU SAID YOU'RE GETTING FEDERAL MONEY BUT HOW- HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDS ARE YOU. DEVOTING TO THIS- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND FOR THAT. ANSWER AND FOR STRUCTURE. ITSELF BOTH FEDERAL AND- EMERGENCY MONEY FROM THE STATE OF BRITAIN BRANDON NEWNESS. I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SUMMARIZE THAT FOR US. IN MINNESOTA HAND UP THERE. YES I CAN YOU. HEAR ME YES. OKAY THANKS FOR THE CALL CENTER AND- YEAH. PRIMARILY A LOT OF THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AND- ARE HAPPY AND LAUGHED ABOUT CITY GRANTS HAS BEEN GOING TO SOME OF THE UPDATES TO THE- ALREADY SYSTEM THE- NEW CODE REPORTING SYSTEM. AND THEN THE FIRST GRANT THAT WE RECEIVED FOR VACCINES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE AMOUNT AND KEEP IN MIND. THAT AMOUNT ROUGHLY HALF WENT OUT TO THE LOCALS- SO WE KEPT ABOUT HAPPENED AT THREE FIFTY SEVEN. AND I THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT ROUGHLY WAS GOING TO UPGRADE OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY SYSTEMS I CAN PROVIDE. SOME MORE DETAIL AS FAR AS WHERE WE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE- LOTS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR- I. T. RELATED SYSTEMS. BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO BIG ONES THAT POPPED TO MIND AS FAR AS THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE USE. OKAY AND FOR THE GREAT SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS NOW ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN- UNDER THE SAME A PUBLIC HEALTH AREA TALKING ABOUT. LABORATORY CAPACITY AND THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. OKAY YES MADAM CHAIR AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO I CAN GO BACK AND- TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND SEVEN AND I THIK WE'LL BE DOING THAT IN TANDEM WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU JUST WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR THAT. OKAY SO OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- POLICE I'VE- TALKED TO PEOPLE LOCALLY. SAID THEY'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES- ENTERING THINGS AND REGISTRY. SO AND I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE LET'S HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND HE'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY BUT ON I. T. PROJECT- THAT'S FAIRLY SMALL. HE'D SAY THAT BUT IT IT DON'T WANT IT IS WE'VE SEEN VARIOUS IT PROJECTS FOR STATE THE SCALE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S- THAT'S NOT A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR I. T. SO. IT'S AND JUST TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH OVERALL WE CAN TALK MORE THROUGH THE CODE SO WE TALK ABOUT TO IT SYSTEMS CAL READY AND THE IMPOSITION. REGISTRY BUT FRONTLINE JUST AND JUST TELL ME I GOT THIS- AND IS LIKE FOR. DIFFERENT IN. SYSTEMS IN SEAT. FOR VARIOUS SURVEY. AND SO. CORRECT DID I GET THE NUMBER CORRECT. THAT'S PROBABLY AT LEAST FOURTEEN OKAY AT LEAST FOURTEENTH OF JUST KEEP IN MIND WE'RE FUNDING ONLY TO AND AGAIN THOSE ARE THE MOST COVERT RELATED RIGHT I MEAN NO YOU HAVE A- ARE- CAL READY WHICH IS ABOUT- MEDIATION BY THE WAY- OUR DISCOUNT READY ABLE TO I MEAN WE SAID IT COLLAPSE WE HAD TO REBUILD IT. I CAN HANDLE IS IT IS IT ACTUALLY CONTAINING INFORMATION ON CONTACT FACING OR NOT YEAH SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAO CAO READY- IS THE IS A DATABASE FOR REPORTABLE DISEASES- IN ONE OF THE CHARGES CAL READY SET FOR COVE IT IS RECEIVING BOTH POSITIVE TEST IN NEGATIVE TESTS. FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IS USUALLY JUST POSITIVE TEST THAT WE HAVE CARE WHICH IS ORGANIZATION REGISTRY WE HAVEN'T CAL CONNECT WHICH IS OUR SYSTEM FOR- CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING. WE HAVE CAL BACKS WHICH IS A SYSTEM FOR PROVIDE VACCINE PROVIDERS TO REGISTER REGISTER- IN ORDER VACS THE WORKER VACCINES THAT'S ALL THAT INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND WE HAVE MY TURN WHICH IS MY TERM PUBLIC TO THE PUBLIC. IT'S A WEB BASED INTERFACE THAT PEOPLE GO GO AHEAD AND REGISTER FOR APPOINTMENTS AND THEN MY TURN CLINIC THAT ALLOWS CLINICS TO ACTUALLY JUST RUN OUT THE WHOLE CREDIT CAN DO APPOINTMENTS. AND SO THOSE EARLY SO I JUST MENTIONED FIVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY- DIRECTLY FOCUSING ON CO THEY DO OVERLAP BECAUSE- MY CARING CAL READY DEAL WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES. SO BUT BUT- YOU KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE. OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE ARE THE ONES AND WE HAVE A MANY. THAT ALSO LIKE. AND FOR- THAT WOULD BE A- SYSTEMS OUT THERE CANCER REGISTRIES- YOU KNOW ABOUT US REGISTRY OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS REGISTRIES YELLS AT THE NEWBORN SCREENING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW DATA ETCETERA AND- EVEN LIKE CHRONIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE WAS GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT THINGS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES AS WELL- THAT- THAT FRANKLY I THINK- WE HAVEN'T BEEN FUNDING VERY MUCH CORRECT- I. WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU TAKE A VITAL RECORDS CANCER REGISTRY AND THEY DON'T THINK OF. THE DATABASES ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE EACH JURISDICTION HAS OUR OWN SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING DATA. AND THEN THE INTO COULD THE COMMUNICATIONS WITHOUT THE LACK THE CLINICAL LABORATORY LABORATORIES IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY OKAY SO AND- I KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY BUT I'M- OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO AND SO IT CLEARLY NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS FUNDING COMING DOWN BUT IT'S VERY FOCUSED TOWARD COVERT RELATED ONES AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ONES- STACK THE STAFF AND WORKFORCE- I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT YEAH WE DO HAVE THAT PROPOSAL FROM- FROM LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. LOOKING FOR MORE LOCAL STAFF I KNOW- THAT- ALSO- EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THAT- WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF STAFF IN OUR LABS AND TIES A LITTLE BIT TO OUR LAB CAPACITY AND WE NEED A PIPE BUILD THE PIPELINE FOR TRAINING PEOPLE. MICROBIOLOGISTS- OF- SELF- ARE THERE IT IS ARE THERE PROPOSALS OUT THERE FOR I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD ARE UC'S OR OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION UNIVERSITIES BE. PARTNERING TO TRY TO BUILD THAT PIPELINE WE TALK ABOUT PIPELINE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIVE POINT FOR OTHERS HERE IN. THIS COMMITTEE- WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO STRENGTHEN THE PILOT ARE YOU ABLE TO HIRE THE PEOPLE YOU NEED. I MEAN I IT'S I MEAN THERE'S NO CULVERHOUSE HARD BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S A CRISIS BUT- EVEN DURING REGULAR TIMES UNDERSTAND THAT DOOR LABS THAT CLOSE BECAUSE THEY CAN HIRED PERSONNEL THEY NEEDED THAT YOU CAN GET A LAB DIRECTOR. YEAH THE- THE LABORATORY THE LABORATORY A LABORATORY HAS VERY SPECIAL ISSUES RELATED TO HOW LABS RUN. AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRAINING FOR THE FOR THE DIRECTORS. AND THEN THE MICRO BY BIOLOGISTS OFTEN TIMES THEY GET RECRUITED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE THEY CAN EARN SOME EXTRA MONEY. AND SO IT'S EASIER TO BRING THE MAN IT'S HARDER TO GET STARTED. TO KEEP THEM- IN TERMS OF HAPPY CAPACITY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I'M I'M A TIME IT I'M TRADING I WOULD HAVE DOCTOR LEVEL HAVE BEEN EMAILED YOU THERE'S A LOT OF WORK WE NEED TO DO THEIR- NOT JUST IN TERMS OF TRAINING BUT ALSO REALLY. SHORING UP OUR REGIONAL CAPACITY OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FROM A DISTANCE BECAUSE SOME OF THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PROVIDED FROM JUST SOMETIMES ANY FIELD TEAMS ANY PEOPLE IN THE FIELD. WHAT I OFTENTIMES JUST NEEDING AND- ANALYTIC POWER- THAT CAN BE DONE THAT CAN BE DONE TO DISTANCE. AND THEN THE LAST AREA I WANT TO MENTION THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. IS THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO RECRUIT RICK RECRUIT IN OUR ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. WE NEED TO RECRUIT PEOPLE FOR OUR FROM THE COMMUNITY AND CREATE PATHWAYS SO THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACTUALLY HAVE A PATHWAY TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE HAS A LARGE WE ARE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AT ALL LEVELS SO WE NEED TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPROVE THAT OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT. I WOULD I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THAT- WELL THIS IS WAIT- OUR SHORE OF LAUGHTER PASSAGE- WAS. IN THERE ARE OTHER I THINK CONCERN AS START OF THE PANDEMIC INABILITY TO KEEP UP I DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND STANDING UP THE VALENCIA LAB EVENTUALLY BUT THAT THAT WAS THAT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THE- ALSO- OUR ABILITY TO CONTACT RACING I THINK WAS CONSTRAINED AGAIN BY LACK OF STAFF. AS WELL- BUT BUT LET ME JUST AND POSE THIS QUESTION BACK AGAIN YOU YOU DO YOU RELATE TO ME ALL THE ISSUES- THESE ARE ISSUES BY THE WAY I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT PRIOR TO COPE AND WE WERE ENTERTAINING. A PROPOSAL- TO ACTUALLY INCREASE TO FUND ADDITIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGISTS- WASN'T INCOME FROM C. PH COME FROM FROM A STAKEHOLDER BUT SO WE KNOW THIS IS A- SO- DO WE NEED TO WAIT FOR A PLAN FOR THIS I MEAN WE ACTUALLY HAD A PROPOSAL PRE COVE IT TO GET MORE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND OTHER STAFF. IS ISN'T THERE WHAT WHY ISN'T THERE A PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW FROMTHIS COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW FOR THE STAFF WE KNOW WHAT. WE'RE DOING WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND THREE FIGHT WE NEED SPEND A WHOLE YEAR TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. NO WILL IT WILL. THE WHOLE YEAR IT'S REALLY GONNA BE THE NEXT THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND I AND I THINK OKAY SO IT IS. THAT PART OF THE BUDGET THEN AND WHERE. IS IT WILL IT WILL HAVE BEEN ABOUT THREE MONTHS WILL HAVE A- WILL HAVE A PROPOSAL- WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY LIKE I SAID WE- JUST STARTED MEETING WITH. STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS. THE STATE BECAUSE A PLANNED FOR JUNE FIFTEENTH SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT RELIGION OR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. OVER THE NEXT SIX SIX MONTHS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN COVE IT. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING AFTER JUST GEN FIFTEEN FOR PLANNING TO OPEN THINGS UP. AND WE'RE CONVENE A HIGHER LEVEL GROUP TO BE LOOKING BEYOND THAT. LOOKING BEYOND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY HAVE. A WELL ROUNDED PORTFOLIO THAT ADDRESSES CHRONIC DISEASES CHRONIC. STRESS BOB. CLIMATE CHANGE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. THERE'S REALLY JUST A VARIETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE AND GET PUBLIC UNPREPARED TO CALL AT ALL AS FOR. THE WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL HAZARDS APPROACH. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE PRINCIPLES OF FROM AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IN A LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE PUTS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO BILL DOT. INFUSION A WAY TO MAKE COMMUNITIES RECALL THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE IS GOOD IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO WE JUST DON'T. SORT OF LOCK IN OUR- RESOURCES JUST ON. DISEASES I'VE BEEN AROUND PUBLICHEALTH LONG ENOUGH. TO KNOW THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN WHERE A LOT GOES INTO ONE AREA. AND THEN ALL THE SETTINGS ARE CHRONIC DISEASES OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE ATTENTION IT NEEDS. AND THE THING IS WE REALLY DO NEED TO GO MORE UPSTREAM AND LOOK MORE CLOSELY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OKAY. AND AM PARTNERING WITH HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT'S THE OTHER AREA THAT WE- HAVE EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN THANK YOU I'M JUST SORRY I'M TRYING MOVED BECAUSE I WHAT. THE TAXES ARE TIGHT HERE TO US SO IT'S A TOTAL OF THREE MONTHS. PROPOSAL IS THIS BOTH C. PH AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS JUST C. PH SO JUST THE SCOPE. OF YOUR THREE THREE MONTHS. WELL CORRECTIVE. IT'S MORE CONVENIENT WE'RE CONVENING THE LOCAL HALL OKAY EVERY. WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP FOR IF THE WHOLE SYSTEM OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY THREE MONTHS ALL RIGHT AND- AND I REALIZE YOU SEE DON'T BE LOCKED IN BUT IS THERE A SENSE OF WHAT THE SCALE OF THIS WOULD BE I MEAN ARE WE TALKING I ASSUME IT'S MORE THAN A MILLION AND MILLIONS IT PRY TENS OF MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. DID TO IS AT LEAST A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT THE THIS IZE OF THIS SO WORKFORCE NEED IS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES. SO YEAH EARLY IN THIS IS PROBABLY NOT BILLIONS- BUT CAN WE GET YEAH I YOU KNOW I THINK YOU CAN GET AN IDEA JUST FROM LOOKING AT JUST DOES JUST FROM THE FEDERAL FUNDING WHAT IT WHAT IT TAKES TO JUST RESPOND TO COPE WITH OKAY SO IT'S GOING TO BE IT'LL BE IT'LL BE I THINK IT'LL BE. A SIX MINUTE IT'LL BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT I CAN'T TO I DON'T WANNA OKAY OKAY WELL SO I WON'T BE SURE WE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES READY AND NOT WAITING UNTIL NEXT JANUARY THE NEXT JULY OR JANUARY WHATEVER OKAY- AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE ACTUALLY JUST RELATED TO LAB YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO MANTRA VERY AND OTHER THINGS A LOT OF CODE RELEASE STUFF OBVIOUSLY THERE'S OTHER NON COVERED RELATED THINGS- FOR- OTHER THINGS WE NEED ON OUR LABORATORY FRONT- IN TERMS OF- INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES. WE APPRECIATE THE VALENCIA LAB- BUT- OTHER YEAH F THE SENATE VARIANTS SCREEN E. L. VARIANT GENERIC VALUATION AND. OTHER TYPES OF LAB CAPACITY ISSUES. YES RIGHT NOW WE'RE- FOR FUNDS FOR THAT WE INTEREST. THAT THE FIRM THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT THAT WILL INCREASE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM. IT HAS TO BE REALLY COORDINATED AT. THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE OTHER THING I WANT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD- REALLY GREAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S. BOTH STAFFERS THE UC'S- THIS THE STATE UNIVERSITIES TO REALLY HELP US. AND THEY'VE BEEN FANTASTIC PARTNERS IN BOTH FROM AND FROM PROVIDING ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVES. AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF RESEARCH A LOT OF RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE LONG TERM IMPACTS OF KOBE BUT ALSO HELPING US IN TERMS OF OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. OKAY SO AND I WASN'T ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT ASIDE FROM THE VALENCIA LAB AND SEE ANY DETAILS ON LABORATORY ON THE OTHER TO PRESS OTHER TWO ISSUES WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED ABOUT YET SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN ELABORATE. ON THAT SO I APPRECIATE THE VALENCIA LAP BUT SOME BUT- BEYOND OF THE LENS ALLOWANCE EVEN THAT MUCH. AND THEN FINALLY- A COMMUNICATIONS- THIS IS REALLY VITAL ANYTHING SOMETIMES WE OVERLOOK THIS AND I THINK. WE THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED COVE IT DOES A LOT OF CONFUSION OF SOME OF THIS WAS I THINK SOME CONFUSION BY CERTAIN POLITICAL LEADERS- SOME. AND PERHAPS A FORMER PRESIDENT UNITED STATES AND HIS SOME OF HIS FOLKS GOOD. SENDING OUT THE- INCORRECT INFORMATION BUT- BUT EVEN WHEN WE HAVE YOU KNOW HE JUST TRYING TO NAVIGATE SO EVEN NOW AS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT GUIDELINES AND- GET. THE PEOPLE ACTED INFORMATION- WHAT KIND OF CAN WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES ARE GOING TOWARD PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OR TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED WERE. TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT MASK WEARING NOT MASK WEARING SOCIAL DISTANCING IT CETERA. WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING PUT- THE CDPH GETTING TO DO COMMUNICATION- BY THE WAY WE ALSO KNOW THAT- IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT YOU CUT STDS WE CUT LOTS OF OTHER. YOU KNOW OTHER ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT WHAT WHAT SORT OF. COMMUNICATION RESOURCES THAT IS- CDPH NEED THAT- THAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A SO NOW THAT WE DO HAVE LARGE AND- IN TERMS OF A- MARKET MEDIA CAMPAIGN- PROMOTE FACTS AND- INCLUDING. BUT YET THEY HAD INTERVIEWS OVER OVER TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE HUNDRED PERSONS- BUT- IT DOESN'T LET ME FOCUS SORRY AND IF YOU GET PROJECTS FOR INTERRUPTING. MY FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE PART BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SO I GET WHICH I HAVE NO. MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE PAYING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA ADS PAYING FOR ADVERTISING SO FAR. THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD OUT THE MESSAGING SO YOU HAVE YOUR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS YOU HAVE YOUR YOU KNOW FILE TO. SAY OKAY WE'VE DECIDED THIS IS AND HOW DO WE TURN WHAT MAY BE A- AND AGAIN I'M A PHYSICIAN WITH A BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH HOW YOU TURN SOMETHING THAT COULD SOMEBODY RATHER TECHNICAL. INTO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY COMMUNICABLE TO THE PUBLIC WHAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE DO WE HAVE TO DO THAT. NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT THERE'S OTHER. ISSUES RELATED TO THAT AS WELL. YES SIR I. YEAH WE DID I MEAN WE DO HAVE A COMMUNITY OFFICE. HERE AT THE AGENCY LEVEL AND THEN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER YOUR- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE CAN. DEFINITELY USE THEM AGAIN IMPROVEMENT IN BEING ABLE TO REACH THE THEIR FIRST COMMUNITIES IN THE WAY. THAT REALLY ARE RESONATES WITH THEM. AND IT TAKES IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND WORK THAT'S ALL PART TO ME THIS IS ALL PART OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE TRUSTED MESSENGERS FROM THE COMMUNITY TO REALLY BE EFFECTIVE. IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON ADS OFTENTIMES THINGS HAPPEN GET HIGH HYPER LOCAL. YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH CHURCHES COMMUNITY CBO'S- IS NOT SUFFICIENT JUST TO JUST TO BE WORKING WITH THE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS. THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE GONNABE OKAY SO IS THAT SOMETHING IS GONNA TAKE YOU A WHOLE YEAR TO FIGURE OUT TO US WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH COVE IT AND OTHER THINGS ARE THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE MORE QUICKLY. WELL THE PLAN IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ALSO ALL THIS ALL COME TOGETHER. BY SEPTEMBER WE PLAN TO HAVE THIS- OUR PROPOSAL TO TOGETHER. OKAY SAN LIKE A FEW. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A LOT MORE. AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO SIT THERE AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL AND NOW WE'RE SITTING ON THIS. AND THEN WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO DECIDE ON FUNDING YET WHICH WON'T START TILL JULY FIRST. I THINK THAT'S I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR POINTS I'M TRYING TO MAKE AND SAID. A LOT OF THESE ISSUES IS TALKED ABOUT ARE NOT UNFAMILIAR ISSUES I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS. THAT WILL BE- SHE WILL ACT ON MORE QUICKLY IS NOT SOMETHING WE NEED TO SIT DOWN THINK FROM GROUND ZERO WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS FOR A LONG TIME. MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK ONE QUESTION OF L. A. L. THEN- GIVEN OUR CONVERSATION HERE- YOU KNOW I REALIZE YOU. YOU CAN YOUR REPORT- THE STATIC YOU TALKING ONLY ABOUT ACTION AFTER ACTION REPORT WHICH I AGREE WITH ALTHOUGH I THINK THE ACTION STILL HAPPENING SO IT'S PERHAPS A BIT ACTION REPORT- AND THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT A MULTI YEAR SUSSMAN. BUT TO ME I'M AFRAID A MULTI YEAR SUSSMAN JUST MEANS WE PUT THINGS OFF- WHAT. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR THAT PERHAPS IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS- BY SEPTEMBER. RELEASE WE'RE GONNA HAVE SINCE YOU KNOW SEVERAL. HOPEFULLY PROPOSALS FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OUT. I KNOW THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE EVEN PRIOR TO COVE IT PERHAPS EVEN POSITED BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT- WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST. IN TERMS OF US MOVING FORWARD. IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T WAIT A WHOLE YEAR. TO START ACTING OUT THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ACTIVE PANDEMIC STILL GOING ON. AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL OTHER. PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS THAT WE FACE. PERHAPS- WE'VE PAID LESS THE- TO BECAUSE OF COVER BUT THERE STILL ON. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR HAN AND I THINK- JUST BEFORE I ANSWER THAT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE- PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DEVELOPING BY SEPTEMBER AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING BASED ON READING THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- THAT. THAT SEPTEMBER PROPOSAL WILL BE PRESENTED AS PART OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY SO THE FUNDING WHEN ACTUALLY START TO FLOW INTO A JACK- JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO- YOU KNOW I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN BUT- YOU MIGHT WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- IN REGARDS TO YOUR QUESTION FOR US SPECIFICALLY- WE SUGGESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY FUNDING THIS YEAR. AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE VERY ISSUES THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHILE AT PERHAPS A MORE LENGTHY STUDY CAN TAKE PLACE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE IT'S SORT OF HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS FOR THINGS LIKE STAFFING AND PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. SO OUR SUGGESTION WAS SOME SOME AMOUNT OF TEMPORARY FUNDING RIGHT AWAY. COUPLED WITH THE LONGER TERM- ASSESSMENT TO SEE WHAT THE LONG TERM ONGOING INVESTMENT SHOULD BE.

SPECIFIED OR- DESCRIBED AND- SO WHETHER SUFFICIENT TIME OR OTHER TYPES OF PROCESSES THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING THROUGH TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT MUCH THEY'VE OVERSIGHT AND SAID- AND HOW THAT MATCHES UP WITH OUR DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE IN TERMS OF STATE FUNDS AS WELL SO WE- UNDERSTAND THE BALANCE BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE FUNDING AND THE TOTAL FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO. SUPPORT VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER ON THIS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND DR PAN I'LL BE SPEAKING ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE. ASSEFA CLEAN REGARDING THIS LARGE MULTI DEPARTMENT INITIATIVE ON THEIR OWN MY COMMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PORTION WHICH IS A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. MY NAME IS ROSE ANOTHER CHRISTIAN AND I SERVE AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY. ASIAN OF OUR OFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY IS THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. TO HELP FOR FULLER VISION WE'RE GRATEFUL TO JOIN THIS CROSS DEPARTMENT PARTNERSHIP. CHANGE THE ARC OF LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS A GENERATION THAT HAS SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS TRAUMA. WITH THIS PANDEMIC UPROOTING THEIR YOUTH THEIR EDUCATION. AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING CRITICAL YEARS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT. DOING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THROUGH THE HEALTH EQUITY PARTICULARLY A RACIAL EQUITY LANDS WE KNOW THAT STRUCTURAL RACISM AND ACCUMULATED SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE MEANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE BORN INEQUITABLE. BY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITIES PLACES WHERE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF MORE WIDESPREAD. EARLIER WE CAN INTERVENE IN THE LIFE COURSE BUT LESS SUFFERING AND THE LESS COST. SO LAST DECADE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A RAND STUDIED THE IMPACT OF THAT SIMILAR EARLIER STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND DEMONSTRATED THE PROMISE FOR SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS BY PREVENTING THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH NOT RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE UNTIL A CRISIS OCCURS. SAVING SUCH AS SCHOOL DROPOUT HOSPITALIZATION INCARCERATION HOMELESSNESS AND SUICIDE AND THEY RECOMMENDED A LONGER TERM COMMITMENT TO A COORDINATED P. E. I. STRATEGIES PREVENTIONAND EARLY INTERVENTION SOMETHING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALIZES IN. TO ADDRESS THEIR RECOMMENDATION THE NEW CHALLENGES POSED BY THE PANDEMIC ON OUR YOUTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REQUESTS CAN POSITIONS EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FROM THE CORONAVIRUS FISCAL RECOVERY FIND. A FIVE MILLION INITIALLY AND THEN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE IN FIFTEEN FORTY MILLION OVER THE SUBSEQUENT FOR YEARS. IF APPROVED THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CHANGE CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD BE STRATEGIC AND EVIDENCE INFORMED THROUGH THE LENS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE GOAL SHOULD BE RAISE HEALTH LITERACY ALL CALIFORNIANS ALL AGES MANY LANGUAGES NORMALIZING HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND WHERE TO GO FOR HELP. AND TACKLING INEQUITIES BY EMPOWERING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES SO WE WILL WORK CLOSELY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND MANY DEPARTMENTS ON THIS INITIATIVE PARTICULARLY THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ON A TOXIC STRESS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. AND THE NEW OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION HOUSE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY HAS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT COMPONENT. THREE COMPONENTS ARE THE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WITH A STRONG PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MARKETING COMPONENTS SOCIAL MEDIA EDUCATION CHANNELS. SECOND A CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS BUILDING ON EXISTING AND PROMISING LOCAL EFFORTS AND THIRD SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE SECRETARY AND GOVERNOR. YOUTH AND POWER MAKE PEACE AGENCY WILL HAVE A YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD THAT WILL PARTNER WITH TO CREATE POSITIVE CONTENT THAT'S DESIGNED BY YOUTH. FOR YOUTH THANK YOU. VERY MUCH A PART IN THE FINAL ANYTHING. DREXEL. HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATE HEADACHE L. A. OKAY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS OF THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF IFORMATION ABOUT THE BASIS FOR THE ESTIMATE OF FIFTY MILLION OVER THAT OVER THESE NUMBER OF YEARS IS QUITE A HIGH FIGURE AND WE JUST- WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT- HOW THOSE ESTIMATES WERE DERIVED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD JUST I WOULD WONDER IF THERE'S SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I'M WONDERING ABOUT HOW THE MEASURING THIS WATER ARE OUTCOMES WOULD HAVE WE- WERE TRYING TO. IMPROVE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH IQ- AND HOW HOW WILL WE KNOW. WHEN WE DO THAT AND I GUESS I ALWAYS AND JUST WONDER FOR. MAKING SURE PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH THAT IT'S ABLE THEN TO BE TIED TO RESOURCES SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY ANY MORE. INFORMATION ABOUT THIS- THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME OR- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON. ID FREQUENTLY OR SOON. AT A AND THEN I ALSO JUST WONDER. I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WAS JUST A PART OF THE OTHER THAT WE HAD THE AT REDUCING DISPARITIES THAT WE FUNDED IT WAS A GREAT PROGRAM AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND- DIDN'T SEEK TO FUND AGAIN THIS YEAR- THEN WHY DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND. HAPPY TO MADAM CHAIR SO- IN THE FIRST YEAR A LOT OF THE RESOURCES AND STAFFING WOULD BE FOCUSED ON DOING A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS BOTH NATIONALLY OF BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS- WORKING WITH PARTNERS ON VARIOUS CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT'S THE CORE TEN POSITIONS WE CERTAINLY WILL BE BUILDING ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT WHICH- WE VIEW HAS BEEN. VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT IS STILL UNDERGOING ITS EVALUATION SO THAT REALLY CHAMPIONS CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE AND ELEVATES THESE COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SO WHILE WILL LEARN FROM AND USE SOME OF THOSE APPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES THIS WILL BE A VERY DISTINCT AND SEPARATE CAMPAIGN FOCUSED PARTICULARLY ON. YOUTH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS WORKING UP THE WOODEN JUST SHIPPED ON A REAL REALLY QUICK. BUT PLANNING THING HONEST. NO I AGREE WITH YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE THAT WE'RE- MOVING TO SOMETHING NEW THAT I'LL GO GET WE ALL AGREE IN THEORY IT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DETAIL ABOUT IT AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME WORK ALREADY BEING UNDERTAKEN. OKAY SHALL WE MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN SUPPORT FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCH AWARENESS AND TRAINING. AND PER NIGHT JUST MEANT. GOOD MORNING FOR THE RECORD MONICA MORALES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND- TO THIS SPECIFIC ITEM OR AN AL SIMMERS AND IT IS AN INCREASE OF SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND WE WILL BE DIVIDING IT UP. FIVE FIVE SUPPORTING OUR STANDARDS OF CARE FOR DEMENTIA AND ALL OF THAT A LITTLE BIT- INTO WHAT WE NEED BYTHESE TWO COMPONENTS OF WHAT WE REALLY SEE IS TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WAY THAT WORKS DETECTING AND DIAGNOSING DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S IN OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS SO OUR GOAL REALLY IS TO TRY TO USE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW POTENTIAL ALGORITHM. OR HEALTH SYSTEMS WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE IT FOR THE PATIENTS WE HAVE THIS SIMILAR APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO DIABETES OR SOMETIMES YOU GO INTO CARE AND YOU KNOW YOUR PROVIDER ACTUALLY CAN SCREEN YOU BASED ON YOUR BMI SCREENING BASED ON YOUR HISTORY- AND LET YOU KNOW YOUR RISK CRITERIA BASED ON DIABETES AT THE SIMILAR APPROACH THAT WE'RE TRYING TO USE IT COMES REALLY ADVANCING FAN. CARE FOR- ALZHEIMER'S IN CALIFORNIA OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN SCREEN FOR HUNDRED IMPAIRMENTS PROMOTE INVALIDATE TOOLS FOR YOU KNOW COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION AND REALLY FOCUS ON BANK AND EDUCATION OF WOMEN OF COLOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS WHO WE KNOW ARE MOST IMPACTED FOR OUTSIDERS. I'M IN TERMS OF OUR- EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ISN'T REALLY TRYING TO DO MORE WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATING CALIFORNIANS ON OUR FRAMERS OUR GOAL IS READY TO ROLLOUT EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN BACKED UP FRONT AND SYMPTOMS OF ALZHEIMER'S BUT ALSO PROVIDES AND YOU KNOW A. LINCOLN SOME PEOPLE TO AXES LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MATERIAL AROUND DEMENTIA WE HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATION YOU'RE NOT COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SUCH AS LGBT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN OF COLOR AND EVEN YOUNG INDIVIDUALS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT OF DEMENTIA WHAT IT IS- NOW SIGNED. SO I'LL THERE. ABOUT GOOD MORNING AT JACKSON FINANCE- ON PAGE THIRTY- THE- ALMOST THE ENTIRE PAGE REFLECTS VARIOUS CHANGES IN THE EXPENDITURE OF THE AUTHORITY BONDS ARE THE MAIN DRIVER OF THIS IS- THE COMPLETION FASTER RECONCILIATION PROCESS GIVING IS A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND FUNDS IN THE AT THE LITTLE THAT WE MAY USE APPROPRIATELY TO. MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE FUND- AT THE END OF THE PAGE HOWEVER YOU'LL SEE A- EMERGENCY ADAM REIMBURSEMENTS- THIS IS ADDING LANGUAGE THAT WILL ALLOW THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TO TAKE AND- FEDERAL GRANTS FROM FEMA- WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS AND PROCESSES IT IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CREATE A NEW.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS EARLIER DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON THIS. DOCTRINE. YEAH THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR L. A- IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION- IN THE RED SEA LANGUAGE BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY OPINION ABOUT THAT. I THINK IT AFTER BEYOND YES WEEK WE NOTICED- THAT THIS NOTIFICATION. THIS NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO BE WITHIN TEN DAYS- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MAKING THAT A REGULAR THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION WE WOULD ASSUME FOR THESE- TYPES OF REIMBURSEMENTS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW TERE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT THE STATE SPENDING THAT'S GETTING REIMBURSED BY FEMA- BUT YEAH TYPICALLY WE WOULD- OUR OFFICE WOULD RECOMMEND A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION PERIOD. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M SURE THE JAIL BC IF THAT- IS FAIRLY NARROWLY CONSTRAINED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER FACTORS AND RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY OF ANY- ANYTHING IT'S FUNDING CUTS ONLY ACT MORE RAPIDLY THIRTY DAYS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE NET NATIONALLY HAVE TAKE THIRTY DAYS TO ACT BUT- IF THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS OR- ISSUES THAT WOULD GIVE TIME FOR. ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION AS WELL SO- HOPEFULLY IN THIS PARTNERSHIP WILL BE HAVE A OLD LOW ENOUGH OF A LEVEL OF TRUST THAT- THAT- THAT THE MINISTERS YOU CAN COUNT ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT MORE QUICKLY IS SUDDEN DEATH WHEN THE NEED ARISES.

HI THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM WHICH I WILL REFER TO YOU AS A CPR WE'RE REQUESTING TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IS ONE OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THE HIGHEST YOU WAIT LIST AS OF THE MAY REVISION THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR AND FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE OF. THREE HUNDRED AND TWO ADDITIONAL CBR BEDS TO BE ACTIVATED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AND FOUR AND A HALF POSITIONS ABOVE THE REQUEST PRESENTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE BINDING REQUESTED FOR THE CBR BEDS WOULD. ON BOTH HOUSING AND OR TREATMENT SERVICES- PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION IN START UP FUNDS FOR THESE NEW PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS CLINICAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND NAVIGATION SERVICES WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY JAIL IN REACH SERVICES IDENTIFY- AND STABILIZE PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. IN ADDITION THE SERVICES WOULD ALSO SUPPORT CREATE WHAT WE CALL PRE TRIAL PROBATION SERVICES TO ENHANCE THE OUR COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROPOSED FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND CREATE YOUR ACTIVATION TWO HUNDRED BEDS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AS WELL AS A BUDGET YOU'RE EXPANSION FIFTY BEDS AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE OTHER COUNTIES- ONGOING FUNDING FOR A MAJORITY OF THOSE TV OUR BEDS REQUESTED IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS ACTUALLY INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PROPOSAL WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN WITHDRAWN. AND THAT WAS REALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE C. C. P. PROGRAM. NOW WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE CCP PROPOSAL ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE CBR BEDS IS NOW INCLUDED AS PART OF- THIS REQUESTED ME RECOGNITION. I'M NOT MY TESTIMONY COMPLETED ACROSS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LMAO. NO NO CONCERNS MADAM CHAIR WE FIND THIS YEAR PROPOSED INVESTMENT TO BE REASONABLE GIVEN YOU KNOW THAT- GROWING DEMAND FOR ICY TREATMENT ON PARTICULARLY ON AT THE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL STUFF. NASSIM L. L. A. COUNTY HAS A CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AND- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS MANY BEDS. THROUGH ALL MEANS AS WE CAN THE CRAFT. SURVEIL YOU ASIAN COMPONENT OF THIS BUDGET CRISIS MANY FOR THESE POSITIONS BUT- GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT WE PULLED MONEY OUT HERE THAT ARE SO IN THE END EVER GONNA HAVE AN EVALUATION AS TO. HOW SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT IS I KNOW WE'VE STRUGGLED WITH THAT. WITH THAT. DEFINITELY BUT WE DO HAVE- FUNDS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT DATA TRACKING SO THAT WE CAN- YOU KNOW PRODUCE INFORMATION AND WE DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION. EVALUATIVE COMPONENT- SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WERE THINKING THROUGH ON ON THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT- WE DO HAVE A NOT A COUPLE OF YEARS A FEW YEARS AND- ABOUT WITH- THE LA COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM AND- AND SO REALLY. LOOKING TO BAD EXPERIENCE TO THEN BRING THAT TO THE OTHER COUNTY. OKAY CELL YEAH I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU SEE PULLED OUT THAT'S WHAT EVALUATION. WAS THAT MEANS THE VALUATIONS ARE THIS. WITHOUT PROGRAM. SO I'M THINKING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME OF VALUATION- OF. THIS INVESTMENT I MEAN IT SOUNDS GOOD ON THE SURFACE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. FOR SOME FEEDBACK LATER TO LEGISLATURE WE MADE THESE INVESTMENTS AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ICE TEAS AND WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO OR NOT. DECREASE THE CASELOAD RIGHT SO- I HOPE THAT THAT'S- THAT SHOULD BE BUILT IN. A IT INTO THE PROPOSAL'S ANTICIPATED EVALUATION AND REPORT BACK TO LEGISLATURE ON ON ON THE SUCCESS OR- OUR LACK OF SUCCESS OR THE DEGREE OF SUCCESS OF THIS OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. FOR THIS ITEM THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO DISCONTINUE THE STATE HOSPITALS AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE SHORT CIVILLY COMMITTED PATIENTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THESE PATIENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND HAS EXISTING LPS PATIENTS TRANSITION FROM THE STATE HOSPITALS TO THE COUNTY UTILIZE THOSE BEDS FOR RESTORATION OF COMPETENT COMPETENCY TREATMENT FOR ISPS. UNDER EXISTING LAW COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF LPS PATIENTS INDIA STAGE IS ONE OF THE TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES WHEN IT COUNTY REFERS AN LPS PATIENT TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR TREATMENT THEY REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT OR THE USE OF THE STATE HOSPITAL BED. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL FOR THE LOSS IN REIMBURSEMENT OTHERWISE RECEIVED THEM FROM COUNTIES FOR THE LPS PATIENT TREATMENT SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THESE BEDS FOR ICE TEA TREATMENT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST THREE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO MANAGE THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION OF THE LPS PATIENTS. AND SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THREE FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING. TO SERVE I S. T. PATIENTS. THE H. ALSO. BUDGET BILL TO BE ABLE ADJUST EXPENDITURES STORY AS NEEDED SHOULD THE LPS CASE THAT WOULD BE REDUCE QUICKER THAN THE PROJECTED IN THIS PROPOSAL. I REQUEST TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION TO ENACT THE NECESSARY STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL AND REMOVE THE S. H. AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR LPS. THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO ENGAGE THE COMPANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION BECOME PRETTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AUTHORITY AND COUNTIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSITION PLAN. TO FACILITATE THE TRANSITION OF LPS PATIENTS TO COUNTY TREATMENT OPTIONS WITH IN THE THREE YEARS. AND WE PROPOSED TO STOP ADMITTING NEW LPS PATIENTS BEGINNING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND STARTING JANUARY WITH ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO. BEGIN REDUCING THE LPS POPULATION FROM THE CURRENT CENSUS WITH THE TARGETED REDUCTION OF ONE THIRD OF THE LPS CENSUS EACH YEAR. THIS ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO DEDICATED SCHOOL BY CAPACITY TO FORENSIC PATIENTS. AND REFLECT THE SHS STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF THOSE FRIENDS LIKE PATIENTS WHILE ALSO BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE WEIGHTLESS. ONGOING REFERRALS AND LEGAL PRESSURE SURROUNDING INDIVIDUALS FOUND IN CONFERENCES STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES. AND REFERRED TO D. S. H. FOR RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY TREATMENT. THERE WAS ONE QUESTION IN THE AGENDA I'M FOR THIS ITEM IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF COUNTY CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT LPS POPULATION THIS COMMUNITY. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THIS PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED TO ACCOMPLISH THE TRANSITION OF LPS PATIENTS OVER THREE YEARS. WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS WILL BE EASIER TO TRANSITION TO TREATMENT OPTIONS WE CURRENTLY HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISCHARGED READY- AND THEY WILL BE EASIER TO. TRANSITION INTO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SPACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OTHERS DUE TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS MAY TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME TO EITHER IDENTIFY OR DEVELOPMENT DEVELOP PLACEMENT OPTIONS. THERE MAY NOT CURRENTLY BE PLACEMENT OPTIONS TODAY FOR THE ENTIRE L. YES I COLLATION. SO WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES. TO DEVELOP THE TRANSITION PLANS WHICH WOULD TAKE INTO A THOSE. SPACE TRANSIT OF PATIENTS ACCORDING IF THE YEARS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CAPACITY MEANS BUT STILL ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSAL BY THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND WE'RE COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM PROPOSED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. COULD BE AN OPTION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ASSIST THE COUNTIES IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE OUTCAST POPULATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A JUST A FEW COMMENTS FROM THE L. A- ON THIS ISSUE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WHILE WE DO FIND THAT- GROWING DEMAND FOR ICE TEA BEDS YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE LEGAL PRESSURES THE DEPARTMENT IS FACING TO. ADMIT I ISSUES IN A TIMELY MANNER MAKES PRIORITIZATION OF- INCREASING BED CAPACITIES FOR ICE TEA WARRANTED. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT FOR STATE HOSPITAL LPS BEDS OFFERED THIS THE HOSPITALS- LPS- DEMAND FOR LPS BATES APPEARS TO BE- INCREASING AS WELL AND- WE FIND THAT WHETHER COUNTIES HAVE CURRENT CAPACITY FOR TAKING ON- TREATMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LPS PATIENTS CURRENTLY IN DISH. REMAINS UNCLEAR- GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK ADMINISTRATION HOW IT WILL ENSURE THAT LPS STATIONS THAT ARE INTENDED TO LEAD PSH. WILL HAVE A PLACEMENT AVAILABLE TO THEM FURTHERMORE YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHY INCREASED RESOURCES FOR. COUNTY BASED ISP TREATMENT THROUGH JAIL BASED PROGRAMS COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAMS AND DIVERSION PROGRAMS INCLUDING YOU KNOW THOSE REQUESTS INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ENOUGH TREATMENT CAPACITY FOR ICED TEAS. ARE SUCH THAT THE S. H. COULD MAINTAIN LPS BEDS AT ITS FACILITIES- IN ADDITION WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT NO THERE IS ANOTHER D. S. H. PROPOSAL- THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE AGENDA WHICH WOULD REQUIRE. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO- TAKE BACK L. I SEE PATIENTS THAT ARE DEEMED UNABLE TO BE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY- ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION A SIZEABLE PORTION OF ITS CURRENT. IDEAS H. LPS PATIENTS ACTUALLY ENTERED THE U. S. H. AS ISPS BUT THEN. END UP AS LPS PATIENTS CIVILLY COMMITTED AFTER THEY ARE- SORT OF DEEMED UNABLE TO BE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY. YOU KNOW WELL THAT PROPOSAL COULD SIMILARLY FREE UP SPACE AND B. S. H. UNIT WE WOULD KNOW THAT IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE COUNTY CAPACITY- INCLUDING POTENTIALLY FOR ADDITIONAL LPS BEDS- FOR WHICH. COUNTY CAPACITY REMAINS UNCLEAR. I FINALLY THAT WE JUST SORT OF NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW THESE THAT WE ABOUT COULD PASS FOR TWO. LPS YOU KNOW DO NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT COUNTIES WOULD BE UNABLE TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW- AS AS NOTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION EARLIER THERE IS A MAJOR PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR'S- BUDGET FOR. YOUR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH DH CS- IN CONCEPT COUNTIES COULD HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS TO THAT PROPOSAL TO. BUILD OUT THEIR CAPACITY FOR TREATING LPS PATIENTS I'M GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR TIMELINE FOR COUNTIES TO BUILD OUT BED CAPACITY FOR LPS PATIENTS- MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH THE TIME LINES THAT ARE OUTLINED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE SORT OF HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- EL DIRECTOR I DID THIS I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THIS NEED AND I UNDERSTAND THIS DESIRE AS AS A MR SHE TO SAID I KNOW THAT THERE'S PRESSURE NOT JUST FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT TO BE ABLE TO- TO TREAT THESE FOLKS AND TO- MAKE THE I. S. T. TIMELINE- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THERE'S A GROWING WITH A CRISIS ON OUR STREETS WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MOVING FOLKS- FROM STATE HOSPITALS BACK DOWN. ON TO PUT IN EVEN MORE PRESSURE AND- COMPACTION OF WE SEE AT OUR BED SPACE AT THIS POINT. THAT MAKES MAKES SENSE- I'M BETTING CERTAINLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS A STATE HOSPITAL LEVEL. THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES A SICK PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICKER- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF FOR A LONG TIME BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WHERE WE ARE ALL. WORKING UP TO THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE THAT SO IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME AND I YOUKNOW I SORRY I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION. M. THERE ARE. THE REST ROOM FOR MORE. FUNDING IN THE IN THE LAST PRESENTATION TO. INCREASE SOME OF HIS BED SPACE. AND NOW WE'RE TAKING ASKING FOR THIS BIG MOVE. AT WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE. TO BEGIN TO PERHAPS WORK TOWARDS THIS GOAL BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IN BED SPACES THERE AS A MISTER SHE TALKED ABOUT. THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE I COULD YOU MOVE CARE BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS THAT'S COMING THROUGH SOME OF OUR PAYMENT RESTRUCTURING. THAT'S COMING THROUGH HOPEFULLY WE'RE WE'RE ALL MOVING- TOWARDS HIS GOAL OF INCREASING OUR CAPACITY ACROSS OUR SYSTEM- WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO WAIT TILL THOSE RESOURCES ARE IN PLACE. BEFORE WE MOVE A WHOLE NOTHER POPULATION UP FROM THE STATE LEVEL BACK DOWN TO COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM I WOULD JUST. SAY WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THIS IS A DIFFICULT PROPOSAL- UNFORTUNATELY WE AT THE DEPARTMENT ARE FACED WITH- A DELICATE CHALLENGE WE HAVE A- WAIT LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WHO AND CONSTITUTIONALLY NEED TO RECEIVE TREATMENT- AND THE DEPARTMENT IS FACING VERY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION PRESSURES WE CURRENTLY. I JUST RECENTLY- HAD AND THE PEEL HEARING WITH RESPECT TO OUR ORAL ARGUMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO OUR H. IN A MOST SIGNIFICANTLY GEISHA SURROUNDING THIS POPULATION AND I WHICH THE REQUIREMENT OF THAT- LITIGATION IS THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT- START- SUBSTANTIVE TREATMENT FOR ANYBODY THAT IS REFER TO IT WITHIN TWENTY EIGHT DAYS WE'RE CURRENTLY WELL BEYOND SIX MONTHS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE HAVE A VERY- SIGNIFICANT- THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ON THE ICE TEAS WE CERTAINLY HAVE AN ROPOSALS IN THAT HIGH MAY REVISION TO EXPAND COMMUNITY BASE RESTORATION COME PASS ANY AND JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT CAPACITY WE HOPE TO DO THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. BUT THAT ALSO IS WERE- ALSO REQUIRES US TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY CONTROL OVER THE TIMELINES THE PROCESSES OR THE NECESSARILY THEIR AGREEMENTS OF THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO STAY ON THAT PASSING A QUICKLY. I WE CERTAINLY WITH BEING- LPS A PROPOSAL ALL OF THAT CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH INCLUDED NOT ONLY COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION JOB IS COMPETENCY TREATMENT AS WELL AS EXPANSION OF DIVERSION AS WELL AS YOU HEARD ABOUT. THE PROPOSALS TO STEP MORE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THIS STATE HOSPITALS AND TO HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO BACKFILL FROM THE WAIT LIST OF IDEAS TO USE A WELL WE'RE CURRENTLY PROJECTING BASED ON ALL THAT CAPACITY- APPENDING PLACEMENT LIST AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE AYE AS TEENS. TODAY WE'RE CURRENTLY I'D- AT. FIVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR IS TO USE ON THE WAIT LIST IN THERE'S ABOUT THREE AND FIFTY NEW REFER THAT IN. SINGLE MONTH THE- THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A CONSTANT DEMANDS- AND SO WE NEED- STEPS AND THAT AND OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THAT OUR REFERRAL BASE CONTINUES TO GROW. AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ALSO PLANNED FOR POTENTIAL GROWTH IN THE REFERRAL BASED AS WELL SO AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW WELL IT IS A VERY- DIFFICULT PROPOSAL FOR THE AT THE TRANSITION OF LPS POPULATION OUT WE DO PLAN TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES TO HELP THEM WORK ON THIS TRANSITION PLANS TO AND- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYBODY THAT IS TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE STATE HOSPITAL GETS INTO THE CARE THAT THE- THAT THEY NEED- BUT WE ALSO DEFINITELY HAVE TO BALANCE THESE COMPETING PRIORITIES AND ULTIMATELY THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORTH IS TO ADDRESS. THOSE CHALLENGES. I HEAR YOU. I DON'T KNOW THEM I DON'T KNOW. CAN ANYTHING HONEST. I THINK YOU COVERED IT THANK YOU. OKAY THE. AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAN C.

WE'RE NOT SEEING OR NOT SEEING A SIGNIFICANT- DIFFERENCE IF WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE THAT THAT- VISUAL INTERVIEW CONDUCTED VIA THE VIDEO ME WE HAD AN ISSUE. BETWEEN BETWEEN THE EVALUATIONS THAT WE CONDUCT IN PRISON AND THEN THE VIOLATIONS THAT WE HAVE DONE- IN COORDINATION WITH. DIFFERENT JAILS ACROSS THE STATE NEEDS. FOUNDED JUST AS EFFECTIVE. I THINK- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE THAT THERE ARE SOME JAILS THAT ARE REALLY NOT SET UP TO DO SOME OF THIS THAT WE DIDN'T IS. A SMALL NUMBER WALL LIKELY HAVE TO OCCUR IN PERSON- BUT WE ALSO RECEIVE ALL OF THE RECORDS AND- VS RESEARCHER TRANSMISSION. EMAIL OR- ELECTRONICALLY ALREADY SO WE DO ALL THAT. WORK IN ADVANCE FOR BUYING- REVIEWING- THE CUSTODIAL RECORDS AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH IN. OUR RECORDS AND SO WE DEAL WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR- WORK LOAD- PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL INTERVIEW. ON THE SHOW. DO YOU THINK THIS IS ALL OF THEM I MEAN DO YOU THINK WILL TAKE A CHUNK OUT OF BEING ABLE TO MEET THAT DE BETTER. I INTEND WE ARE WE DEFINITELY NEEDED AS PART OF OUR PACKAGE OF SOLUTIONS AND ALSO TO HELP- BY SOME TIME. AS WELL AS- PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE ARE IN THE G. B. C. T. PROGRAMS. RAMP UP- MIGHT HANDED OVER TO THE DOCTOR WERE BURTON WHO IS OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND HE'S HAD SOME DIRECT EXPERIENCE. AROUND THIS. DR THANK YOU I'M CAN'T WORK ON OUR MATTER DIRECTOR AT THE ESTATE WE HAVE SEEN SOME SUCCESS AND WE ARE SEEING OUTCOMES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE IN HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO PATIENTS WHO ARE ALREADY COMPETENT OUR RESEARCH THREE C. DAVIS HAS INDICATED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT MAYBE ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE THAT WERE ADMITTING IS ACTUALLY COMPETENT WHEN THEY HIT THE DOOR AND IN THIS SORT OF VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WE'VE DONE A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY EVALUATIONS AND WE FOUND THAT ONE IN THREE ESSENTIALLY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE INTERVIEWED VIRTUALLY IS ALREADY CONFIDENCE SO- IN TERMS OF THAT OUTCOME IT'S COMPARABLE. I THINK FIVE CLINICALLY WHERE WE REALLY. S. NEED IS THE MEDICATION OF THESE FOLKS THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SENT TO US IS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL HAVE A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. AND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS IN A PSYCHOTIC MEDICATION AND- I THINK THE EVALUATION SERVICE. OUR COULD BE QUITE ROBUST IF WE FIND THE JAILS- WANTING TO PARTNER WITH US AROUND GETTING THAT MEDICINES THAT PATIENTS. SO AT THIS POINT THE JAILS ARE THE ARE OMPLYING WITH MEDICATION MANAGEMENT UNDER THEIR CARE. SOME ARE AND SOME AREN'T. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY- TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THAT AND PROVIDE WHATEVER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. BECAUSE I WOULD GUESS THAT IF- IF PEOPLE ARE EVALUATED THAT THE REAL KEY TO STAND TRIAL WITHOUT MEDICATION MANAGEMENT IF THEY REMAIN IN JAIL THAT CAN QUICKLY ADD DIGRESS. YES YES REALLY APPRECIATE THE BOTTOM LINE CLINICALLY IS COMPETENCY AND MEDICATION ARE PRETTY MUCH- THANKS RIGHT OKAY AS AS- MOST OF THESE FOLKS ARE PSYCHOTIC IF THEY'RE ON MEDICINE HOW WE CAN GET THEM COMPETENT AND IF THEY'RE NOT- THEY REMAIN INCOMPETENT OR- AND RETURN TO INCOMPETENCE IF THEY'RE NOT PROPERLY MEDICATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD I WOULD NOTICE STAFF THAT REMIND US TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COUNTY'S NON COMPLIANCE WITH- WITH MEDICATION MANAGEMENT- PLEASE KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON THE FRONT END ON ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON.

THIS PROPOSAL LARGELY REMAINS UNCHANGED AS THE S. H. CONTINUES TO CONTRACT OUT FOR A VARIETY OF MEDICAL TREATMENT SERVICES AREN'T THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN A STATE HOSPITAL. CURRENTLY EACH HOSPITAL IDENTIFIES CONTRACTS WITHIN PAYS PROVIDERS FOR SERVICES AND STANDARDIZED METHOD. ADDITIONALLY SOME PSH HOSPITALS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS SUCH AS ATASCADERO OR CALLING A WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FIND. OUTSIDE MEDICAL PROVIDERS WITHIN REASONABLE DISTANCE OR AT REASONABLE COST. ADMINISTRATIVELY YES H. INVOICES PAYMENT PROCESS LACKS. GATOR DATA CAPTURING ABILITY TO ENABLE THE S. H. TO ANALYZE TRENDS WITHIN OUTSIDE MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY DRIVE. AWESOME SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND DECISIONS BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING- AND SUMMARY A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS ONE ABLE D. S. H. TO GAIN ACCESS TO A MULTITUDE OF PROVIDERS.

IT FOR THIS ITEM THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THAT NON RESTORE WILL INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DEFENDANTS FOR WHOM THE DEPARTMENT HAS FILED A REPORT TO THE COURT. THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WILL REGAIN COMPETENCY OR WHO HAVE REACHED THEIR MAXIMUM- I S. T. TERM OF COMMITMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT BE RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE COUNTY WITHIN TEN DAYS. AND IF THE PATIENT IS NOT RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE COUNTY WITHIN TEN DAYS AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT TO CHARGE THE COUNTY AND DAILY BED RATE AS IT IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO DO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY BUT REMAIN IN INDIA S. H. BETTER AFTER TEN GAMES. CURRENTLY THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE STATUTE AS TO WHAT IS TO OCCUR AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL IS DEEMED NON RESTORE MALL OR REACHES MAX COMMITMENT IN DIFFERENT COMPORTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE STATUTE DIFFERENTLY. THE STATUTE CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD ARE TO BE RETURNED TO COURT WITHIN TEN DAYS HOWEVER THERE IS NOT AUTHORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CHARGE THE DAILY BED RATE IF THEY REMAIN OVER TEN DAYS AS CURRENTLY EXISTING STATUTE OR INDIVIDUALS RESTORED TO COMPETENCY. ADDITIONALLY SOME COURTS INTERPRET THAT AFTER BEING RETURNED TO COURT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE RETURNED TO THE DEPARTMENT OR REMAIN AT THE S. H. FUNDING THERE CONSERVATORSHIP INVESTIGATION. I THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEEMED UNLIKELY TO REGAIN COMPETENCY AND THERE REMAINED AND THE DSA SPENT LONGER THAN TEN DAYS HAS GROWN BY 12100% FROM TWENTY FOUR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHEN A NON RESTORE WELL I. S. T. REMAINS IN A STATE HOSPITAL BED IT. PREVENTS THE DEPARTMENT FROM ADMITTING NEW IC PATIENTS ARE AWAITING TREATMENT. SO THIS STATUTORY CHANGE IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE UTILITY LOOKING UTILIZATION OF OUR BED CAPACITY FOR ICE TEA TREATMENT. TO ADDRESS. THE ON GOING MEATLESS FOR ISPS.

ABOUT SEVENTY THINK IT'S SEVENTY FIVE OF THEM. ULTIMATELY STAYED IN A HOSPITAL BED AND BECAME BEEN CONVERTED TO LPS THE REST OF THEM WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE COUNTY. AND EVENTUALLY BUT THE SEVENTY THREE OR THE SOMEBODY FIND THAT CONVERTED AND ALSO CREATES AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE FIRST BECAUSE- THEY STAY IN A BAD- SO THERE YOU TYPE THE I. S. T. BAD DURING. THE COURSE OF THE TIME THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THEIR CONSERVATORSHIP. HEARING BUT THEN WHEN THEY CONVERT TO LPS BASED AND THEN ARE IN THAT BED AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AN LPS BED AVAILABLE THEY STAY IN THE I. S. T. BAD. I'M IN THE BY PASS THE I. S. T. WAIT LIST SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE WAIT LIST- AREN'T GETTING IN FOR LPS TREATMENT EITHER BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST STANDING BY PASSING THAT WAIT LIST SO IT CREATES A- UTILIZATION CHALLENGE FOR BOTH R.
