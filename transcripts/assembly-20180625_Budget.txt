SIX SEVENTEEN AS WELL THE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION FOR OUR HEALTHY RESILIENT FORCE PROPOSAL. AS WELL AS TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL FIRE RESPONSE WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. LAKE MISCAST ANY. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SOUGHT A QUESTION ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. CAN YOU GO THROUGH WITH US THE RATIONALE THAT YOU USED IN ALLOCATING MONEY TO DIFFERENT BY PROGRAMS FROM CAPITA RATE. SURE I'M I THINK GENERALLY YOU'LL SEE WHEN WE DO DISPLAYS WE LOOK AT AND THE ENACTING LEGISLATION HAD SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES LISTED FOR CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES IN THOSE THINGS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE AIR TOXIC AND CLIMATE AIR POLLUTANTS. AS WELL AS RESEARCH IS THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE CATEGORIES WHEN WE PUT TOGETHER THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN OF COURSE IT'S PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT WITH LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS SOME COMPROMISES WHILE SPARS SCENE OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS WITHIN THOSE. BROAD CATEGORIES BUT THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO USE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ZACHAREK THAT'S CORRECT. SO WHEN WHEN I LOOK AT SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. I THINK THAT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT MONEY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SPENDING AND IN THIS CASE EFFICIENCIES REALLY EASY TO CALCULATE BECAUSE YOU JUST TAKE A TOTAL COST OF A PROGRAM. IN DOLLARS YOU DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF TONS OF CARBON IT REDUCES AND YOU GET THE PRICE PER TONNE -- THAT ACOSTA REDUCE THAT AND I WAS JUST STRUCK LOOKING AT THE EXPENDITURE PLANET THE WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT EFFICIENCIES BECAUSE WE GOT SOME PROGRAMS WERE FUNDING THAT ARE VERY EFFICIENT I MEAN I HEALTHY FOREST A DAIRY DIE JESTERS -- ORGANIC RECYCLING ALL OF THOSE ARE UNDER TEN DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED BUT THEN WE GOT THINGS LIKE THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER TON THAT'S FOUR TIMES LESS EFFICIENT. AND THEN -- THE CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS VOUCHER INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH IS OVER FORTY AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER TON WHICH IS OVER TEN TIMES LESS WHAT NO FORTY FORTY TIMES LESS EFFICIENT SO. THAT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THE VARIETY OF EFFICIENCIES THERE WHY NOT JUST TAKE THE MONEY I MEAN IF IF THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES WITH THIS MONEY. AND THAT'S WERE CHARGED WITH DOING WHY NOT JUST ALLOCATE THEM TO THE MOST EFFICIENT USES USERS Y. WHILE THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OR PUTTING IT TOGETHER EXPENDITURE PLAN IS CURRENT EVENTS AND SO CLEARLY WE HAVE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN HEALTHY FORCE. THIS YEAR GIVEN WHAT HAPPENS ON RECENTLY ON PROBABLY -- HIGHER THAN WE HAVE IN PAST YEAR HE IS ONE LENDS TO LOOK THROUGH THE ALSO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT MORE RECENT EVENTS TO SEE IF THERE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT WE SHOULD BE MADE. ON AN FORCES CERTAINLY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT NIGHT FEEL GET NO ARGUMENT FROM ME BERMAN BECAUSE KURT WITH EVENTS WITH NOTWITHSTANDING. HEALTHY FORESTS ARE ONE OF MOST EFFICIENT USES OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS IN TERMS OF DOLLARS SPENT PER TONS OF CARBON REDUCED I JUST WONDERED WHY. WE'RE SPENDING ALL OF THIS TAXPAYER MONEY ON YOU KNOW VERY INEFFICIENT USES. WHEN WE LOOK TO YOU THROUGH THE LINES OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION BUT DOC I MEAN THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION I GUESS IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS I HAVE THOUGH? AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IN FUTURE YEARS WE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THAT EFFICIENCY WHEN WE ALLOCATE THIS MONEY BACK MISTER WHO OUGHT TO CRACK ANSWERED THE RHETORICAL QUESTION I THINK WE END UP -- SPENDING THOSE CATEGORIES BASED ON AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. FOR THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT. SO IF WE ONLY WERE TO FOCUS ON DIE JESTERS OR FOREST'S WE WENT TOUCH. ANY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT ON NOW WAS TENURE CARD EFFICIENCIES I THINK IS YOU KNOW WELL. WELL STATED AND I THINK THAT THIS IS -- THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS IS NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY WOULD JUST SIMPLY BE. TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO DO SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE MUST PRACTICAL WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT SO I THINK THAT WE DO. ARM HOW THESE PROGRAMS TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND AT TIMES -- FOR THEY GET TO BE -- MODIFY THE COMPLETE AND CONTINUE TO BE APPROVED THAT -- OBVIOUSLY THE MORE IMPROVEMENT THAT WE HAVE IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. THEN IT IT BECOMES HARDER AND HARDER TO MOVE INTOAREAS THAT WE HAVEN'T MADE AS MUCH PROGRESS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU DO SEE. OF A MENU OF OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD PUT A BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE DAIRY TIE JESTERS AND WHILE THEY ARE EFFICIENT ON THEY HAVE. A DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EFFICIENCIES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE FARMS AND WHERE THEY ARE PLACED SO AGAIN -- I THINK YOUR POINT IS POINT IS WELL TAKEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TO CONTINUE -- TO DELVE INTO AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL BUT LIKE AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S MISTER CHAIR NOTHING ON THAT WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THAT SPECIAL THE DIGEST HERS I THE MOST ADJUSTERS IN. CALIFORNIA MY DISTRICT. BECAUSE MONEY HAS VERY LOW RATES AND THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS WE'VE DONE FOR OUR DAIRY HERDS -- FARR'S FEW YEARS AGO AT ABOUT XP THOUGH LOIS AND ABOUT IT RATE IN THE NATION. BUT WE DON'T DRIVE OUR DEAREST OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE GARDEN MILK PRODUCTS FROM ELSEWHERE THAT IS A REAL ISSUE THE THREAT WITH THAT. AND THEN ALSO YOU CAN SEE V. RP THE MONEY WENT BACK TO RICH FOLKS FOLKS THAT. REALLY DIDN'T NEED THAT MUCH HELP AND IS GHOSTLY HOV LANE SO I MEAN RIGHT NOW YOU BY -- HYBRID AREA IN THE V. DRIVE THE CAR PULLING. H. O. V. LANES WERE MADE FOR HIGH UP IN THE VEHICLES. AND THE TERM HOV BUT NOW FOLKS ARE DRIVING IT TO COMMUTE TO WORK BASICALLY SO IF YOU CAN AFFORD MTV. NICOLA CARPOOLING IN THE MEANTIME VEHICLES THAT. ARE GAS GUZZLERS THAT ADMIT YOU KNOW [inaudible] A WE HAVE GAS EMISSIONS STUCK IN PLANES TWO THREE AND FOUR PUTTING UP THE WORLD SO IT'S KIND OF OUR BALANCE THESE DAYS LOOK AT A CAR PULLING. MODEST SINGLE VEHICLES DRIVING THROUGH THEIR SO I MEAN SOMETIMES I THINK WE GOT OUR PRIORITIES WRONG AND I DO AGREE WE NEED WHAT'S THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. AND FOR NOT GETTING THAN SOME THESE AREAS. THANK YOU LAW ALL POINTS WELL TAKEN. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NOT SEEING ANYBODY IN SUPPORT OF S. B..
