00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.600
WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS ENSURING

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.569
THAT THE PERSON WHOSE BODY IS

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.170
BEING OPERATED ON?

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.472
IS ACTUALLY A PART OF THAT

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:14.640
DECISION.

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:17.009
BECAUSE THE BABY BY DEFINITION

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:18.744
CANNOT BE PART OF THAT DECISION

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.946
RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:23.682
INVOLVED IS A PERSON WHOSE BODY

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.751
IS BEING PERMANENTLY CHANGE.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.586
THE PERSON WHO'S GENERAL'S WILL

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.521
BE PERMANENTLY IN YOUR REVERSAL

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:30.656
CHANGE.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:31.957
AND THE PERSON WHO MAY BE

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.359
PERMANENTLY STERILIZED.

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.961
MAY PERMANENTLY LOSE SEXUAL

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.996
SENSATION OR MAY HAVE PERMANENT

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:39.898
INCONTINENCE PROBLEMS THAT

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.034
PERSON SHOULD HAVE PARTICIPATION

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.769
AND A SAY.

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.904
IN THEIR FUTURE.

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.272
ALL WE'RE ASKING COLLEAGUES.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.740
IS THAT THE PERSON WHO'S BEING

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:52.544
OPERATED ON BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:54.246
IT'S NOT SIMPLE.

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:55.781
AND TO BE CLEAR.

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:57.716
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDICALLY

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.685
UNNECESSARY SURGERIES.

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:01.620
SURGERIES THAT CAN BE SAFELY

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:03.588
DEFERRED THE BILL IS VERY CLEAR

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.757
THAT IF THE SURGERY IS MEDICALLY

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:07.926
NECESSARY FOR EXAMPLE IF A CHILD

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.628
CANNOT URINATE.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.596
THAN THE SURGERY OF COURSE MAY

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.165
AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED.

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:15.000
ON THAT BABY.

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.968
SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.837
IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.806
SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES.

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:22.708
MEDICAL PRACTICE IN MANY CASES

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:24.609
HAS BEEN TO PERFORM POTENTIALLY

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.778
DANGEROUS SEX ASSIGNMENT AND

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.314
QUOTE ON QUOTE NORMALIZATION ARE

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:30.282

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.483
ON THE SEX CHARACTERISTICS OF

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.618
INTERSEX BABIES.

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:36.021
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM APPEAR

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.923
QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL.

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:40.358
THERE IS NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:41.893
TO SUGGEST THAT THESE VERY

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.829
PERSONAL DECISIONS NEED TO BE

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.263
MADE BY DOCTORS AND PARENTS SO

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.531
EARLY IN LIFE.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:47.933
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.701
RESEARCH INDICATING THE SUCH

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:51.670
PROCEDURES CAN HAVE DEVASTATING

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:58.477
LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES.

00:22:58.543 --> 00:22:59.678
WE ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWING

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:01.279
DOCTORS AND PARENTS TO MAKE

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:03.148
THESE DECISIONS AND WE WANT THE

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.383
CHILDREN TO BE INVOLVED.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.452
I WANT TO BE ALSO VERY CLEAR --

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.287
WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE SOME OF THE

00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:10.422

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.366
THIS IS NOT ABOUT AN ATTACK ON

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.702
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:26.037

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.641
I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE

MEDICAL PROFESSION.

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:33.111
AND I HAVE ON MANY CASES MANY

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:34.679
SITUATIONS BEEN ALLIED TO THE

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.448
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:38.283
INCLUDING ON SOME VERY VERY

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.685
DIFFICULT ISSUES.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:41.820
YOUR DOCTORS ARE NOT ALWAYS

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:43.288
RIGHT.

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.490
AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:48.360
NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.295
IN FACT WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:52.430

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:54.966
NOT SO PRETTY HISTORY.

MINORS FOR SIMILAR REASONS.

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:32.971
OVERWHELMINGLY WE SHOULD DEFER

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:35.473
TO PHYSICIANS MEDICAL JUDGMENTS.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.642
ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS.

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:38.977
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:40.545
AND THERE ARE RARE AND

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.047
EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.182
WHERE MEDICAL PRACTICES CAN

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:46.184

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.430
NEED FOR SURGERY.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.865
IT WAS A FEAR OF GAY AND

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.033
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE THAT LED TO

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.802
THE FIRST INTERVENTIONS ON A

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:33.271
TYPICAL GENITALIA.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.140
WOMEN WITH LARGE **** IS WHERE

HISTORICAL ROOTS.

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:51.322
IN SEXISM AND HOMOPHOBIA.

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:53.725
JUST AS LGBT PEOPLE FOUGHT

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:54.993
AGAINST BEING CLASSIFIED AS

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.694
MENTAL DISORDERS.

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:58.329
INTERSEX PEOPLE PEOPLE FIGHT

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:00.198

WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:09.107
WHEN THEY LEARNED THEIR SEXUAL

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:10.909

INFANT HYPOSPADIAS SURGERY?

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.214
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR YOUTH

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.783
WHO HAVE LOST SEXUAL SENSATION

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.685
TO INFANT CLITORAL REDUCTIONS.

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.053

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.122

VAGINOPLASTY IS.

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.794
FRANKLY WHAT HURTS THE MOST IS

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:31.629
NOT THE PHYSICAL PAIN BUT THE

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:33.498
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WERE ROBBED OF

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:37.135
OUR OWN MOST INTIMATE CHOICES.

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.738
LONGER HAPPENING.

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.140
IT'S BECAUSE THEIR OWN

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.375
DEFINITION OF INTERSEX IS

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:47.679
INTENTIONALLY NARROW.

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:49.047
A RECENT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.648

MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THE YOUTH

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:10.468
THAT I OVERSEE.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.070
IT HAS BECOME A GUIDING LIGHT A

00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:13.905
RECLAMATION THAT OUR BODIES OUR

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.240

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.348
BROKEN.

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:24.882

THE GREATEST ETHICAL FAILURES OF

MODERN MEDICINE.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.071
CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY PROTECTS

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:48.206

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.129
ALL PERFORMED ON THE IASED AN

UNPROVEN ASSUMPTION THAT MEETING

SURGERIES.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.811
THESE FEMINIZING PROCEDURES ARE

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.546
MOST COMMONLY DONE IN PATIENTS

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:40.058
MY DUTY AS A PHYSICIAN IS TO DO

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:41.693
NO HARM TO MY PATIENTS.

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:42.894
WHEN THE FDA ISSUED A WARNING

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.228
ABOUT A VAGINAL MESS PRODUCT

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.431
AFTER ONLY 5210% OF PATIENTS

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.112
NEVER HAVE APPROVED IT.

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:02.347
CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME ADULTS

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:03.614
WHO ARE SATISFIED THAT THESE

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.149

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:19.230
SAY IN MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:20.832
MEDICAL ABANDONMENT.

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:27.405
THE PATIENT.

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:29.273
THE ONLY WAY TO DO NO HARM IS TO

WAIT AND LET THOSE WHO MAY WANT

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.111

GENITALIA THAT WAS NOT

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.785

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:14.518
SURGERY WAS NOT INTENDED TO MAKE

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.453
ME HETEROSEXUAL OR CHANGE MY

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.921

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.591
INSTEAD SURGERY REDUCE NUMEROUS

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.960
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS AND

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.361
PREVENTED ME FROM STARTING MY

PERIOD THROUGH A SMALL URINARY

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.431

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:29.166
WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT ME IN PAIN

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.667
AND TREMENDOUS EMOTIONAL

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.836
DISTRESS.

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.972
SB TWO OH ONE IS AMBIGUOUS AND

NECESSITY AND AGE OF CONSENT.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.678
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS IN PLACE

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.813
WHEN I WAS BORN.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.581
THE ADVICE OF MY DOCTORS WOULD

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.383
HAVE BEEN SILENCED.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.618
I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO

START KINDERGARTEN KNOWING I

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.789
WOULD WET MY PANTS AT SCHOOL

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.957
BECAUSE I COULD NOT CONTROL WHEN

ACCORDING TO SB TWO OH ONE MY

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:01.932
SURGERIES WHAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.700
MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:06.470
WEDDING MYSELF UNCONTROLLABLY IS

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.672
NOT DISABLING OR CAUSING SEVERE

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.741
PAIN.

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:12.009
AND IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE MY

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:14.211
OWN PERSONAL TRAUMA BECAUSE THIS

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:15.979
BILL STATES PSYCHOLOGICAL

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:18.649
FACTORS DO NOT CONSTITUTE

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:21.118
MEDICAL NECESSITY.

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.653
I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.322

THE TRUE INTERSEX PEOPLE

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.793
EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR THEIR VOICE.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.296
YES SB TWO OH ONE WAS ORGANIZED

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.731
WITHOUT HEARING THE VOICE OF THE

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:37.034
C. H. COMMUNITY.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:38.902

H. WOMEN WHO HAD SURGERY EARLY

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:44.475

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.877
BOTH SIDES TOLD ME THEY DO NOT

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.246
WANT THIS BILL.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:51.048
I AM NOT A SURGERY ADVOCATE BUT

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:53.016
I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS THE WRONG

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:56.487
ANSWER TO A VERY COMPLEX MATTER.

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.422
I BELIEVE BUNCHING OVER THIRTY

THEY'RE ALL DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.394
AND EACH PERSON IS UNIQUE IS

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:06.830
CARELESS.

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.799
PERCY H. THERE MAY NEVER BE A

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:10.601
PERFECT ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS A

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:13.337
HEART CONDITION TO LIVE WITH.

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:15.072
BUT I KNOW SENATE BILL TWO OH

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:15.706

ADDITIONAL HARDSHIPS FOR ME AND

MY FAMILY.

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.612
I KNOW A BILL THAT BLOCKS ACCESS

AND DISCREDITS MENTAL HEALTH.

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:30.654

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.083
SIGNIFICANT HISTORY OF

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.819

INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OPINIONS ON

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:00.857
THIS I DON'T.

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.392
THAT'S DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF AN

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.593
ASSOCIATION.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.797

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:11.234
THAT EVERY PERSON WHO UNDERGOES

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.403
THE SURGERY WHETHER IT'S FROM CH

EVERYONE.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.976
IS DISSATISFIED CLEARLY THERE

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:23.480
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GLAD THAT

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:25.315
THEY HAD THE SURGERY.

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.017
BUT THE QUESTION AS ABOUT THE

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.253
PEOPLE WHO.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.288
AREN'T WHO EITHER WERE ASSIGNED

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:33.690

OR HAVE PERMANENT PROBLEMS AS A

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.328
RESULT OF THE SURGERY.

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:40.697
AND EVEN IF AND THERE ARE SOME

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.599
DISPUTES ABOUT THE DATA BUT EVEN

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:43.800
IF WE ASSUME.

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.468
THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:49.205
SATISFIED -- DOES NOT JUSTIFY

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:51.875
SUCH PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.176
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ASSIGNED

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:55.445
THE WRONG GENDER OR PERMANENT.

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:58.515
PROBLEMS -- AND IS THERE IN

00:56:58.581 --> 00:56:59.783
TERMS OF THE HARM.

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:01.417
OF WAITING UNTIL A CHILD CAN

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.520
EXPRESS FOR THEMSELVES.

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.588
YOU KNOW GIVING INFORMED CONSENT

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.223

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.435
IN ONE DIRECTION.

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:22.005
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO'S BEING

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.907
HARMED SO COULD CARRY A CLEAR

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.575

STANDING TO PROVIDE CONSENT SO

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.765

ENSURING THAT THE CHILD COULD

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:14.924
NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:17.260

HOW IT SHOULD BE.

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.396
BECAUSE SOME HAVE SUGGESTED

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.463
INCLUDING MEMBERS THE

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.932
LEGISLATURE MAYBE THERE SHOULD

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.800
BE A SPECIFIC AGE WHERE THE

DISARRAY THINK IT'S A BIT

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:52.889
PROBLEMATIC.

REQUIRES A SIGNATURE AND SOME

00:59:59.195 --> 00:59:59.963

THAT GIVEN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.266
STAGING THAT.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.068
THAT WOULD HOLD UP.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.203

PATIENTS.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.963
A HIGHER RATE OF COMPLICATION --

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.198
A HIGHER RATE OF INFECTION WHEN

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.666
KIDS GO THROUGH PUBERTY THINGS

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.334

AND THERE IS THIS IS DEFINITELY

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:40.903
A HIGHER RATE OF INFECTION ALL

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.374
THAT WE DO -- THERE'S A AND THEN

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.043
A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT THE

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.379
ONLY TO SECOND SURGERY -- KIDS

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.014
IT IN HAIFA STATUS THEY HAVE A

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.582
HIGHER RATE OF THE HOLDEN TIP

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.283
THE **** BECOMING THE AND SO I

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.351
ACTUALLY JUST TO CLARIFY THOUGH

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.153
I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.488
SEVERAL DIFFERENT -- YES.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.155
RIGHT ALL THESE INCREASED

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.690
INFECTION INCREASED BLEEDING

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.793
INCREASED PAIN -- BABIES OFTEN

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.395
DON'T NEED NARCOTICS AFTER

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.096
SURGERY -- WE HAVE AN OPIOID

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:08.998
CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY -- EARLY

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:11.334
EXPOSURE NARCOTICS LENDS ITSELF

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.036
TO MORE DRUG USE TEENAGERS DO

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.704
NEED NARCOTICS AFTER THE

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:18.274
SURGERIES -- AND A POOR OUTCOMES

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.511
REPEAT SURGERY -- ACROSS THE

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.712
BOARD.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:23.746
OKAY AND THEN OF THE

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.381
ENDOCRINOLOGIST THEN YOU'RE NOT

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:31.421
SURGEON SO WHITE WEDDING

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.389
ENDOCRINOLOGIST OPPOSED.

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:33.923
STATE HEARD FROM SEVERAL

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.458
PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.025
EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:36.659
THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND IS THAT

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:37.727
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:38.761
THERE'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:41.764
BIOLOGY SO THERE ARE MANY MANY

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.833
MOLECULAR RAMON ALL GENETIC.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.035
PROBLEMS THAT CAN LEAD TO

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.838
GENITAL DIFFERENCES AND I DON'T

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:49.472
THINK WE CAN TREAT THEM ALL THE

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.540
SAME.

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.941
THAT'S MY MAIN OPPOSITION WE

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.477
SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.878
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.113
DIAGNOSIS.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.048
AND FROM WORKING THERE -- IN

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.383
TERMS OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.486
MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT SOMETIMES.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.821
NOT OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES INVOLVE

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:05.922
SURGERY.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:08.091
AND SO I DON'T LIKE THAT WE'RE

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.859
TREATING EVERYTHING THE SAME.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.994
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.064
THE SERVER DOCTOR WONG ALSO

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.399
RESPOND TO THAT FOR SURE.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.068
I FIND IT A BIT SPUR YES -- FOR

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.003
MY COLLEAGUES TO REMARK ON ON

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:24.173
HOW ADULTS SURGERIES -- ARE MORE

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.741
MORE CHALLENGING -- BECUSE

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.844
THERE IS DOCUMENTED LITERATURE --

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.779
ON HOW CERTAIN IN CERTAIN HAND

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.247
TYPE OF SPEEDIEST REPAIRS HAVE

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:32.081
THE SAME.

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.050
RESULTS -- IN ADULTS AND

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.985
CHILDREN -- I HAVE A PAPER FROM

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.687
WARREN SNODGRASS HERE I'M FROM

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.422
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH SAYS

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.524
EXACTLY THAT DESPITE POPULAR

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.392
OPINION THAT IS THE CASE -- AND

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.961
WE ALSO HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT --

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.329
PEDIATRIC UROLOGISTS ARE NOT THE

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.997
ONLY PEOPLE WHO ALTER WHO

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:50.867
OPERATE ON GENITALIA -- THAT YOU

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.935
KNOW THERE IS A GROWING --

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.637
COALITION OF SURGEONS WHO ARE

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.372
ABLE TO DO TEENAGE AND ADULT

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.174
TRANSGENDER SURGERY -- IN THESE

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.109
PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:03.212
THEIR OWN BODIES -- AND WHO GO

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.914
THROUGH SURGERIES IN OUT NO

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.149
SURGERIES WITHOUT COMPLICATION

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.417
WE ALL KNOW THAT -- BUT THAT'S

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.086
TRUE ALSO OF INFERENCE SURGERIES

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.188
WHERE THERE ARE I I'VE HAD STORE

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.157
HEARD STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.591
BETUL PASSED HIS NERVE HAD THEIR

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.959
PARENTS HAD TO DILATE THEM.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.128
WEEKLY UNTIL THEY THIRTEEN AND

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:23.599
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:24.700
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND PAIN.

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:25.401
I I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.503
IGNORE THOSE STORIES AS WELL.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:31.040
OKAY BUT CLARIFY WE HEARD GUESTS

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:34.177
YOU MUST IS ON YES -- FIVE THANK

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:37.146
YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE AND JUST FIRST

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.081
OFF -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:40.583
SENATOR WIENER THE CARES

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.451
FOUNDATION IS NOT HOME OF THICK

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.954
I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE I WOULD GO

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.190
TO THEM FAT FOR THEM SO I JUST

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:47.690
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.226
THANKS -- AND THEN THE SECOND

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:52.728
PART IN TERMS THE NOTION AS I

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:55.698
SAID IN MY IN MY STATEMENT.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.133
THAT.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.467
IT'S NOT THAT I'M FOR OR AGAINST

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:01.204
SURGERY IT'S THE FACT THAT THIS

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.339
IS SUCH A COMPLEX.

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:05.775
MATTER THAT EITHER WAY IT'S A

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:08.344
TOUGH CALL -- EITHER WAYS

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.413
UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE'S GOING TO

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.615
HAVE THE EXACT PERFECT OUTCOME

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:16.052
BUT ASSUMING EVERYONE'S THE SAME

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.454
AND AND NEGLECTING THE MENTAL

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.122
HEALTH IMPACTS OF POSSIBLY

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.391
DELAYING SURGERY AT LEAST ALL I

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:25.328
CAN SPEAK FOR CH -- BUT I'VE

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:28.364
SPOKEN TO C. H. INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.800
HAVE SAID THAT WAITING.

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:33.502
TILL EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN WAS

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.204
THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.672
IMAGINE AND SOMETHING THEY WOULD

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:39.842
NOT WISH ON THEIR WORST ENEMY.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.612
SO THE FACT THAT WE LIKE I SAID

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.280
THAT IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT --

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.148
TO SIDE STEP ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.184
HAVE BEEN HURT BUT I THINK THIS

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:51.654
IS THE WRONG ANSWER TO A VERY

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.624
VERY COMPLEX MATTER.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.260
I AGREE WITH ADRIAN.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:59.328
CENTER AT THE FINISH.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.664
OKAY WELL I DIED.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.065
I GUESS ONE LAST GOOD FOR THE P.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.001
R. KERALA JUST BECAUSE IT IS A

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.068
SITE I I SUPPORTED THE

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.104
RESOLUTION AND I THINK WE SHOULD

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.972
TRY TO THE LADY.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.507
SURGERY WHEN THEY HAVE WILL FOR

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:14.877
ABLE -- TO THAT WHEN IT'S REASON-WAS THAT IT'S A COMPLEX DECISION

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:15.511
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:19.548
HERE AND THE CHALLENGE HERE IS

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:21.217
WE'RE TRYING TO LEGISLATE.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.419
PRACTICE MEDICINE AND THAT

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.387
ALWAYS YOU KNOW AND EVEN WITH

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.822
THE BEST INTENTIONS THAT OFTEN

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:29.325
DOESN'T -- YEAH PEOPLE GET

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:30.493
CAUGHT UP IN THAT.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.961
CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO WHERE

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.296
IS THE PEDIATRIC UROLOGY

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.531
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.566
THAT ARE THE THE THE THE BROADER

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.934
ISSUES ARE RAISED BY.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.369
A CENTER WINNER AND INTERSECTS

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.904
COMMUNITY I ANY I THINK THEY DO

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.073
HAVE A POINT -- IN TERMS OF%

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.508
WHERE WE WILL TRY TO GET TO AYE

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:46.942
AYE I'VE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:51.247
LEGISLATING IT BUT BUT CAN BE

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.381
PERHAPS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:52.882
HOUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:56.085
LEGISLATING MEDICINE -- THINGS

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.020
HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH TIME EVEN

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.089
WHEN IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.657
YEARS -- ALMOST EVERY MAJOR

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:02.858
CENTER HAS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:03.926
CLINIC.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.995
ON REALLY AND THE NUMBERS WERE

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:08.364
TALKING ABOUT TRUE DST PATIENTS

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.466
TRUE INTERSEX PATIENCE IS

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.668
ESTIMATED BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.036
KIDS IN CALIFORNIA YEAR.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.772
AN ADMITTEDLY THOSE VERY COMPLEX

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:17.740
PATIENTS.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.508
IT'S IT'S A HARD ANSWER WE DON'T

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.744
HAVE THE RIGHT -- ONE I CAN TELL

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.413
YOU THAT -- MY COLLEAGUES AND I

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.948
IN THE WHERE I TRAINED FOR

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.683
FELLOWSHIP AND EVEN WHERE I CAME

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.953
FROM FOR RESIDENCY.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.487
SURGERY WHICH IS NOT THE

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.722
IMMEDIATE ANSWER WE DON'T WANT

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.357
TO BURN BRIDGES WE DON'T WANT TO

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.225
DO THINGS TO KIDS THAT WE THAT

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.027
CAN'T BE REVERSED -- THE

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.061
SURGERIES THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:43.165
ABOUT LARGELY TODAY ARE -- FOR

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.667
NORMAL FUNCTION AND BETTER

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.936
OUTCOMES MEDICALLY LIKE REDUCED

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:49.171
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS -- AND

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:51.374
AND WE DO THOSE THINGS NOT TO

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.243
NORMALIZE -- A CHILD WE DO THOSE

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.113
THINGS TO HELP THEM FUNCTION --

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.081
AND SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.584
THOSE TRUE DST CASES -- WHICH I

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.052
THINK ARE ALSO IS ESTIMATED A

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.653
HUNDRED SURGERIES IN THE ENTIRE

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.756
UNITED STATES A YEAR.

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.526
I'M YOU YOU -- THOSE ARE

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:11.694
DIFFICULT I THINK EVERYONE'S

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.462
GONNA ADMIT THAT BUT I THINK THE

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.564
THING IS WE TRUST YOUR MEDICAL

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.433
PROVIDERS TRUST YOUR STATE BOARD

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.034
LICENSING PEOPLE THAT.

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.136
IN THESE MULTI DISCIPLINARY

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:22.471
CLINICS WERE IN A WORK TOGETHER.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.105
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE BEST

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.508
ANSWER -- EVERY SINGLE PHYSICIAN

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.309
THAT I KNOW ON THE QUESTION I

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.811
ALWAYS ASK EVERYBODY IS DO YOU

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.045
COME TO THE HOSPITAL YOU COME

PERFECT AND TO TAKE THE BEST

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:37.787
CARE POSSIBLE AND IN CHILDREN'S

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.221
HOSPITAL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.557
GONNA HAVE THAT UNANIMOUS ANSWER

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:42.191
EVERYWHERE.

HUMANS -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.065
DIFFERENT GAME.

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:25.734

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.838
SENATOR HILL.

IN HER MICROPHONE OF FIRST

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:32.374

THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.914
AUTHORING THE BILL AND I'VE CO

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.249
SPONSORED IT WITH YOU AND

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.618
ADMITTEDLY I KNEW VERY LITTLE

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:43.185
LIVE.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.720
ACTUALLY CLOSE TO NOTHING ABOUT

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.489
THIS ISSUE AND TELL YOU BROUGHT

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.457
THE BILL FORWARD BUT AS SOMEONE

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.025
FROM THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.093
SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN WITH

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.296
SCOLIOSIS A CURVE IN MY SPINE --

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.965
I KNOW I'M I'M JUST I'M

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:59.134
SENSITIVE TO THINGS THAT HAPPEN

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.937
AT BIRTH AND I WAS GOING TO ASK

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.305
THE QUESTION ORIGINALLY BUT I

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.673
THINK YOU SORT OF ANSWERED IT

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.609
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.178
MOST OF US KNOW THAT AS YOUNG

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.679
CHILDREN WE HAVE OUR TONSILS

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.014
TAKEN OUT.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.415
BECAUSE IT REDUCES INFECTIONS

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.817
WHEN WE'RE OLDER BUT THAT'S NOT

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.118
DONE IT BIRTH IT'S DONE.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.520
WHEN?

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:20.089
CHILDREN ARE OLDER FIVE SIX

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:22.458
SEVEN I SUPPOSE -- MAYBE YOU CAN

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.093
ONCE AGAIN SPEAK TO WHY WHY

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.561
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SO

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:28.697
COMMONLY DONE AND IT'S OKAY THAT

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:30.466
THAT GUY AND LATER.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.369
IN LIFE BUT THURMOND AND SO DID

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.703
HAVE IT'S SO DIFFERENT.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.605
WITH THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:37.640
RESPECTFULLY ON TO TRY TO SAY MY

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.941
LAN I'MNOT NEAR NOSE AND THROAT

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.609
SURGEON -- BUT BUT I AM SOMEONE

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.478
WHO ALMOST HAD A TONSILLECTOMY

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.113
AS A YOUNG CHILD -- THAT'S

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.881
USUALLY DONE FOR INFECTION --

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.817
FOR SNORING -- FOR SLEEP APNEA --

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:50.286
SUE THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S IT

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.487
TAT'S A DIFFERENT THAT'S A

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.588
DIFFERENT BALL GAME AND IT'S

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.156
AMAZING THAT YOU MENTION THAT

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.491
BECAUSE THE DECISIONAL THEM THE

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:56.992
MOST RECENT DECISION ALL REGRET

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:57.660
PAPER.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.361
ACTUALLY TALK TO PAY TO PARENTS

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.629
ABOUT DECISIONAL REGRET AFTER

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.964
TONSILLECTOMY.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.166
AND IT WAS 412409% OF PARENTS

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.935
HAD DECISIONAL REGRET AFTER

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.103
TONSILLECTOMY WHICH IF YOU LOOK

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.506
AT THE PAPERS FOR THE C. H. --

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:12.441
REGRET YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE FROM

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:15.311
20% 240% WHICH IS ACTUALLY LOWER

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.246
THAN PARENTS REGRETTING

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:20.249
TONSILLECTOMY SO -- THERE'S THAT

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.617
AT BUT I THINK THAT.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.585
THE THE QUESTION MEDICAL

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.120
NECESSITY AGAIN IT'S VERY STICKY.

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:27.089
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DEFINE AND

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.290
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.458
IT'S POSSIBLE.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.126
AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO DEFINE

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:37.199
THAT IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T HARM

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.834
SOME CHILDREN.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:39.868
AND THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.270
ARE DEFINITIONS OF MEDICAL

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:42.805
NECESSITY THIS ISN'T SOME SORT

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.173
OF VAGUE AMBIGUOUS THING.

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:44.907
AND YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HEARD

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:45.574
COMMENTS ABOUT A PERSON

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:48.010
STRUGGLES TO URINATE WERE.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.447
HAVING PHYSICAL PAIN OR HAVING

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.315
YOUR AND THAT'S THAT'S ODD

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.351
PULLING IN TRAPPED IN YOUR ****.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:56.919
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.221
ABOUT HERE DODD -- I THINK UNDER

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:01.256
ANY REASONABLE DEFINITION WOULD

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:05.794
BE MEDICAL NECESSITY AS I SAID

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.363
AT THE BEGINNING.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.032
IF IF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.133
THAT OPPOSING THE STOCK PRICE

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.002
AND SAY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.003
ARE OPPOSE THE BILL.

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:14.837
HAVE A CONCERN THEY ONCE YOU'RE

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:15.671
CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:16.639
MEDICAL NECESSITY THE WAY THAT

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.606
TYPICALLY WORKS IN THE

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.041
LEGISLATURE IS A COME FORWARD

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:19.608
AND SAY WE DON'T LIKE YOUR

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:20.676
DEFINITION.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.845
HERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.446
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF SOMEONE IS

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:27.082
IN PAIN IF SOMEONE HAS -- URINE

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.517
PULLING IN EVERY CHINA AND CAN'T

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.419
URINATE OR MIGHT URINATE WHEN

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.054
THEY DON'T WANT TO URINATE.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.156
IF SOMEONE -- IT IS REALLY

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.424
HAVING THOSE MEDICAL PROBLEMS

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.192
DOT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.460
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:41.830
ABOUT -- HERE -- AND I THINK

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:43.365
2240% REGRET IS ACTUALLY QUITE

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:46.168
SIGNIFICANT -- IN MY BOOK BRING

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.770
YOUR REVERSIBLE SURGERY -- AND I

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.238

CORRECTLY ABOUT QUOTE CHIU

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:53.776
INTERSECTS PATIENTS BEING --

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.844
THREE TO FIVE PER YEAR DOT DOTS

01:11:55.911 --> 01:12:03.085
ODD THAT'S NOT ACCURATE IT'S NOT

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.621
EVEN CLOSE DR.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.256
I HAVE A QUESTION.

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.357
ABOUT JOHNNY IT SEEMS LIKE MOST

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:08.957
OF THE DISPUTE IS AROUND WHAT

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:09.992
THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:10.826
NECESSITY IS AND PERHAPS.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.094
YOU WILL CONSIDER IN ADDITION TO

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.028
THE BILL NOT INSTEAD OF BUT IN

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:13.729
ADDITION TO HAVING AN ADVISORY

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:14.163
TASK FORCE.

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.497
OF SOME SORT THAT WOULD MAKE

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:17.433
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE MEDICAL

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.435

WE WILL BE OPEN TO THAT CAUGHT

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:27.076

OF IT IN IN I. N. ALSO IS A LOOK

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:32.100
THROUGH THE ANALYSIS THAT THE

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:33.735
THE VERY CAPABLE STAFF.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.437
PUT TOGETHER THE SAME QUESTIONS

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:36.405
THAT I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:37.840
ARE RAISED IN HERE IS SOME OF

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.441
THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WE HEARD

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.909

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.377
A DEFINING THE YOU KNOW

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.479
MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND HOW WE

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.547
WOULD DO THAT AND HOW HOW YOU

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.048
WOULD.

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:48.183
THE TERMINOLOGY -- OF MEDICAL

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.352
NECESSITY IT'S TOO LIMITING AND

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:53.255
THE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HOW WE

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:53.822
WOULD COME TO THAT AND WHICH

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:55.224
WOULD PROBABLY MOST TROUBLING S

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.392
THESE ARE DEFINITIONAL ISSUES

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.194
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE AN

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.362
CRAFT.

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.263
AND THEN AS I LOOK AT THE LETTER

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.297
FROM THE CALIFRNIA MEDICAL

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:03.665
ASSOCIATION IS PROBABLY WHEN I

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.033
HEAR THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.001
WILLING.

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.603
OR ANYONE HAS BEEN WILLING TO

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.104
SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE THEIR

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.606
PERHAPS THE CLARIFICATION OR THE

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:11.874
DEFINITIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.308
AT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.544
THERE'S ROOM HERE TO COME TO

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:19.014
SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT AND WHICH

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.515
TROUBLING TO IS A READ IT SAYS

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.017
ON BEHALF OF THE THIS IS THE

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.852
LETTER FROM THIS THE CMA.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.721
ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN FORTY

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:26.655
FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.423
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.259
THINK THEY'RE HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:33.862
FIVE THOUSAND LICENSE PHYSICIANS

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.097
IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY REPRESENT.

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.031
SMALL PORTION OF THAT NUMBER IS

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.532
THERE A GROUP SOMEWHERE.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.701
THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.336
AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING WORKING

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.939
WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE --

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.407
AND IN THE COMMITTEE THAT CAN.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.809
OF CRAFT THOSE DEFINITIONS I

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.444
THINK IF YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE TO

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.913
WALK AWAY FROM THAT ESPECIALLY

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.247
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT WITH THE

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.349
RESOLUTION CALLED FOR LAST YEAR.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.184
AND THE SUPPORT THAT I THINK --

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.920
WE HAVE FOR SOME.

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.355
SOME FUTURE OF SOME.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.324
SOME COMPROMISE IN THIS AND I

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.392
THINK THE DEFINITIONS AS MISS

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.726
MARCH WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MEAN

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.495
THEIR SOMETHINGS THAT APPLIANCE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.230
SOMETHING'S IT SHOULDN'T APPLY.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:09.097
OF ED IN HIGH DIED -- I'M GOING

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.332
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.267
BECAUSE I THINK I WANT TO MAKE

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.835
SURE THAT IT DOES MOVE SO THAT

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.037
WE CAN GET [inaudible]

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:16.004
THOSE.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.606
QUESTIONS THOSE DEFINITIONS

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:20.075
ANSWERED IN SOLVED IN SOME FORM

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.277
BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.178

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:27.182
CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION --

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.818
BUT IT -- IT IS A IT'S

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.253
UNFORTUNATE THAT WE CAN'T SIT

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.822
DOWN WITH THE PROFESSION -- THAT

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.924
IS -- RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:39.962
THESE DECISIONS AND AND GET TO

OUR FOLKS AND SO I WANNA SAID NO

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.937

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.278
CONCERN WAS THAT -- THAT THAT

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.747
THOSE WHO WE LOOK TOWARDS TO TO

BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:05.721
IF THEY HAVE NOT THAT'S THAT'S

THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL AS WELL

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.627
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:12.861
STAFF.

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:13.495
WE HAD TWO MONTHS OF TRYING TO

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:14.196
GET CA H. EXEMPTED FROM A SIMPLE

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.098
RESOLUTION LAST YEAR THAT THAT

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.265
THAT THE AUTHOR WOULDN'T TAKE IN

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.867
THAT RESOLUTION SO WE HAVE HAD

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.235
CONVERSATIONS I JUST WANT TO BE

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.803
CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT THAT WE

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.071
HAVE NEVER HAD CONVERSATIONS.

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:24.373
IT HAS COME UP IT'S A

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.141
COMPLICATED ISSUE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.377
THOUGH WE DO HAVE DIFFERENCES.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:29.711
OF THEY WANT TO LEGISLATE THE

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.946
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:33.515
CONSIDER THINGS LIKE HYPOSPADIAS

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.516
AND C. H. AS INTERSEX.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.685
THE REALITY IS WE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.253
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.222
THEY WANT TO ALLOW THEY DON'T

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.156
THEY DON'T WANNA HAVE PARENTS

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.991
INVOLVED IN THE DECISION WE

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.393
FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT.

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.761
THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.163
NECESSITY WE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.565
DISAGREE WITH THOSE TO CENTER

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.100
HELD YOU KNOW I I THINK A LOT

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:52.768
ABOUT YOU AND WE'VE WORKED A LOT

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:55.470
TOGETHER -- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.172
YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.006
OKAY AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.509
ISSUES OKAY -- I'M GONNA GO TO

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.044
IS CENTER LEYVA BUT BEFORE I DO

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.046
THAT I WANT TO LEAST RESPOND TO

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:07.382
WITH A THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:09.184
MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR HILL.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.585

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:10.886
HAVE SAID.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:11.486
AND I THINK IT'S A POINT OF

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:12.354
FRUSTRATION FOR ME.

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:14.489
AND I THINK FOR OUR THE

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:15.123
COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS IS

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.091
THAT.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.527
THERE SEEMS TO BE ROOM TO FIND

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.228
SOME COMMON GROUND HERE AND ALL

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.164
THE PARTNERS HAVE NOT BEEN

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.799
WILLING TO PUT THAT.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.133
THINGS ON THE TABLE AND TRY TO

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.234
CARVE OUT.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.203
DEFINITIONS MORE CONCISELY IT'S

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.738
PART OF WHY I THINK THIS.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.406
BILL IS IS NOT READY AT THE

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.309
MOMENT -- BUT I I AM I HAVE

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.944
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT IF WE CAN

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.279
KEEP WORKING ON IT THAT WE CAN

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.748
TRY TO FIND THAT THAT SPACE.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.083
BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THAT THE

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:43.051
COMMON GOALS WE ALL HAVE FOR THE

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:45.253
HEALTH OF OUR KIDS SO IT IS A

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.922
POINT OF FRUSTRATION -- EVEN

BATS WITH THE SURGERY SHOULDN'T

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.120
HAPPEN ON A CHILD'S AT WHICH A

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.125
BUT SO AND THEN MY QUESTION FOR

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.427

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:02.097
IT'S NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AT

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:05.467
THE TIME THE CHILD IS BORN WHY

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:08.737
IS WAITING A PROBLEM.

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.772
AND JUST TO REFER TO MY PREVIOUS

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:13.308
COMMENTS -- I THINK THE CHILDREN

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.709
EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN OR

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.912
COMPLICATIONS -- AND THEN THERE

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.713
NEED FOR SURGERY THE SECOND

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.515
SURGERY INCREASES -- AS THEY GET

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:23.118
OLDER IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:23.518
IN.

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:24.419
IN.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:25.420
A LOT OF OUR LITERATURE LE

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.255
HENSLEY PAPER I KNOW THAT YOU

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.990
KNOW THAT WHEN DOCTOR WONG --

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:30.759
AND EVEN IN MY MOST RECENT

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.427
RECENT EXPERIENCE AND GONNA WE

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.663
OPERATED ON KIDS THAT WERE THE

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.431
SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS OF AGE

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.899
OPERATE YOUNG KIDS UP -- TO

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:38.767
TWENTY AND THE KIDS WHO WERE

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.669
TEENAGERS OLDER EVEN THE THREE

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:41.836
AND FOUR YEAR OLDS HAD A HIGHER

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.773
RATE OF COMPLICATION -- AND

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.909
ALTHOUGH ANECDOTAL -- I THINK

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:49.177
THAT IT THE HENCE THE PAPER

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.378
SHOWED THAT DEMONSTRATED THAT

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.913
THERE IS ANOTHER PAPER I THINK

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.615
FROM CANADA THE DEMONSTRATED

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.751
THAT -- AND SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.420
HARDER FOR THE CHILDREN TO DELAY

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.621
SURGERY.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.456
IN RESPONSE TO HURT HER REMARK

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.158
TO ME I AM AWARE THAT PAPER AND

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.559
THAT THE PAPER FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:06.795
AND ONE USING -- TECHNIQUES THAT

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.096
ARE SOMEWHAT OUTDATED.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:08.863
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:09.931
THINK THEIR TOTAL THIRTY FIVE

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:10.765
PATIENTS IN THAT COUNTRY IN THAT

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.901
STUDY IN OVERALL THERE WAS A

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:14.269
HIGHER RATE EVERY OPERATION

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.404
EXCEPT IF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.606
SUBGROUP ANALYSIS.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.241
ONLY EIGHT OF THOSE PATIENTS

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:21.076
WERE ACTUALLY DINOVO HYPOSPADIAS

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:22.811
IN OTHER WORDS ONLY EIGHT HAD

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.813
NEVER HAD PREVIOUS SURGERY SO

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:25.847
EIGHT THOSE OF THOSE EIGHT

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:27.515
PEOPLE THERE WAS A 100% SUCCESS

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:28.617
RATE AFTER TWO SURGERIES WHERE'S

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.285
THE REMAINING PATIENTS WHO HAVE

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:31.286
HAD PREVIOUS.

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.388
INFANT SURGERIES YES THEY HAD

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.823
HIGHER COMPLICATION RATES WE

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:36.291
JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT AGAIN

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.425
THAT -- INTERPRETATION F

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.128
MEDICAL DATA CAN BE VERY BIASED

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:41.730
BASED ON PEOPLE'S PEOPLE'S OWN

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.265
OPINIONS THANK YOU AND I DID

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.966
WANT TO SAY ALSO THAT WE WE

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.101
HEARD I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:46.735
IT BUT SOMEONE WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:47.902
REFERRING TO STUDIES THIRTY

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.104
YEARS AGO FORTY YEARS AGO.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.405
EVERYTHING IN HERE HAPPENED

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.040
WITHIN THE LAST THREE TO FOUR

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.975
YEARS AND WHEN THEY YOU KNOW ONE

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.543
MOTHER TALKED ABOUT I I THINK

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.012
THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.346
I I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.216
CHILDREN I NEVER THOUGHT TWENTY

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:01.850
SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN OUR TWINS

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.285
WERE BORN THAT WE COULD HAVE AN

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.819
INTEREST TAX CHILD I WISH

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.288
SOMEONE HAD SAID THAT WE DIDN'T.

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:08.056
BUT WHAT WHAT IF WE DID AND WE

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.357
HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NO

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.059
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE SHOULD

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.193
OR SHOULDN'T DO FOR THIS CHILD.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.395
SO I THINK EDUCATION IS

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.530
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND TALKING

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:18.133
TO PARENTS WHEN THERE ARE ABOUT

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:19.634
TO HAVE A CHILD THAT YOUR CHILD

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:20.802
TO BE BORN EXIST OR WHEN YOUR

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:21.670
CHILD IS BORN LIKE THIS THE

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:22.170
FIRST THING YOU SAY IS

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:22.871
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:24.205
YOU HAVE A HEALTHY CHILD WHO

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.874
LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.509
SOME OTHER CHILDREN DO BUT WE'RE

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.710
GONNA WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:29.878
TOGETHER.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:36.718
MY WORRY IS THAT.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.786
IT WE'RE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:38.420
BETTER AS A SOCIETY AND WHEN I

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.922
READ SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT.

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:41.523
ABOUT CHILDREN WHAT WE PUT IN

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.157
THEM PUT THEM THROUGH AND THEY

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.858
HAVEN'T HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY I

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.627
THINK CA AT AGE IS A LITTLE

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:48.129
DIFFERENT -- I'D LIKE TO SEE US

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.631
I THINK WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.399
FOR OPEN TO WORKING ON THINGS.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.234
I WORRY THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.869
THAT SURGERY -- EARLIER THAN

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:55.970
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.572
COULD HAPPEN TO YOU CAN'T GO TO

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.373
KINDERGARTEN TO BE WAITING YOUR

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.674
PANTS ALL YOUR PEERS WITH THINK

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:00.975
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.544
YOU WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT -- SO

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.145
I HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:06.214
ASPECT BUT YOU KNOW.

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:10.418
I NGUYEN IN READING THE STUDY OF

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.087
ONE MOTHER SAID TO SHARE SIX

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.755
TOWN SHE JUST SAID SOMEONE ELSE

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:14.956
WHY HER SON LOOK DIFFERENT.

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.791
THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE WAS BORN

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:17.759
AND HE LOOKS DIFFERENT DOWN

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.560
THERE.

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.362
AND WHY DO WE SO AS A SOCIETY

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:21.863
WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:22.831
CONFORMS.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:24.499
WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU'RE BORN THE

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.567
WAY YOU ARE?

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.102
SO I I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.236
RAMBLING BUT I ALSO JUST THINK

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.038
AS AS A SOCIETY WE'RE SUPPOSED

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.740
TO GET BETTER WHEN YOU TALKED

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.375
ABOUT CONVERSION THERAPY I'M SO

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:34.943
GLAD THAT I WAS HERE TO GET TO

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:36.611
BE A PART OF BANNING THAT.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.413
AS A MOTHER OF A GATE CHILD IF

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.681
MY DAUGHTER BEEN BORN TWENTY

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.516
YEARS AGO SHE PROBABLY WOULD

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:42.150
HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WAS

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.184
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER --

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.152
WHICH OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.353
WRONG WITH HER SHE'S GETTING

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.521
MARRIED IN THE FALL TO A WOMAN

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.623
SHE'S JUST HPPY SHE CAN BE SHE

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.191
SIX SUCCESSFUL WOMAN.

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.260
BUT I WORRY THAT WE ARE DOING

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:55.263
THE SURGERIES UNNECESSARILY ON

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.432
THESE CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.300
HAVE ANY SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.268
AUTHOR HAS SAID.

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:02.771
SO ALL OF THAT TO SAY I WANT TO

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:03.938
SEE THE I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.273
TODAY I WANT TO SEE IT MOVE OUT

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.775
I HOPE THERE'S SOME WORK WE CAN

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.310
DO I HOPE THAT -- THAT CMA AND

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:10.912
AM A WILL COME TO THE TABLE

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.480
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THERE

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:13.982
SOMETIMES BUT FUNDAMENTAL

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.984
DISAGREEMENTS -- BUT THIS

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.752
AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.721
LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES SOME THANK

TO SENATOR WINNER TO CLOSE I

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:58.927
WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:02.030
FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DAY AS

01:25:02.096 --> 01:25:03.565
CENTER GALGIANI.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.066
YOU KNOW I I BROUGHT UP EARLIER

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:08.636
ABOUT WHETHER THE AUTHOR MIGHT

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:10.371
AN ADVISORY BOARD TO MAKE

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.508
RECOMMENDATIONS ON ON AND WITH

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:15.677
THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN THIS

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.846
SPACE HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:19.347
THE DEFINITION OF MEDICALLY

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:21.683
NECESSARY IN STATUTE OR WHATEVER

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:22.350
THAT IS.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.353
I THINK THIS CHALLENGE THAT --

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.322
MY COLLEAGUES ARE HAVING IS THAT

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:29.824
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT.

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.359
WHAT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:33.094
WHAT'S NOT CERTAINLY SENATOR PAN

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:35.430
HAS MUCH BROADER KNOWLEDGE THAN

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.564
MOST OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.799
HERE BUT?

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.567
I FEEL THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:42.203
SENATOR HILL SAID AND YOU WERE

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.506
WILLING -- TO CONSIDER PUTTING

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.074
TOGETHER AN ADVISORY BOARD IN

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.943
THIS CAPACITY TO ADVISE ON THIS --

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:51.145
SO I'M HOPING AND WOULD LIKE TO

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:53.948
ASK YOU IF IF YOU WOULD.

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:56.384
TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL TO

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.686
CREATE THIS ADVISORY BOARD SAID

01:25:58.753 --> 01:25:58.887
THAT.

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:01.289
WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS.

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.825
COMING UP WITH THOSE DECISIONS.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.426
I'M THERE THE ANSWER IS YES

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.028
CENTER  APPRECIATE THAT AND WE

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.197
ALSO OF COURSE STAND READY TO

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.298
WORK WITH THE MEDICAL

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:11.699
ASSOCIATIONS.

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.334
ON ANY SUGGESTIONS THEY HAVE

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:14.435
ABOUT THE FINING MEDICAL

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.271
NECESSITY IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.973
ABOUT THE EXISTING DEFINITION --

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.642
BUT THE ANSWER IS YES THANK YOU.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:23.945
SO -- I GUESS MY MY RESPONSE TO

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.680
THAT SENATOR THAT CONSTRUCTIVE

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:27.315

THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO FIND THE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.786
SPACE IS COMMON GROUND SPACE.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.054
AND I THINK IF IT MEANS THAT WE

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.023
TAKE IN ANOTHER WEEK AND WORK

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.424
THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS -- WITH

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:38.059
THE AUTHOR AND WITH WITH THE

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.093
COMMITTEE STAFF.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.194
WE CAN SEE WHETHER WE HAVE

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:41.896
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE IN THE

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:43.698
RIGHT FORM FOR US TO TO CONSIDER --

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:45.133
NEXT WEEK ON THIS ISSUE.

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:46.568
AT THAT IS THAT THE DIRECTION IN

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:47.936
WHICH YOU'RE HEADING.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.204
I THINK IT'S ONE THAT I CAN

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:51.973
SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.473
ALL RIGHT.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.608
ALL RIGHT WITHOUT THAT FURTHER

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.643
DO THAT LET'S FINAL COMMENT

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.779
CENTER PAN.

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.514
SO I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:02.450
IS THAT -- BASICALLY IN THE BILL

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:03.952
SAYS DOING THIS IS

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:04.953
UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHICH

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.354
MEANS YOU'RE THREATENING LICENSE

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.022
OF A PHYSICIAN AND EVEN.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.091
AND IT BUT FIRST THE TREATMENT

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.693
SO IT'S FAIRLY BROAD SO IT.

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:14.462
ALSO MEANS THAT -- I MEAN IT'S

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.030
NOT CLEAR I MEAN SOME OF THESE

01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:17.932
CAN SAY MEDICAL NECESSITY BUT

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:20.034
SOME OF IT ALSO -- I THINK

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.769
RACISM CHALLENGES FOR PHYSICIANS

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.705
TO KNOW YELP BUT WHAT POINTER

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:24.839
LICENSE MIGHTBE THREATENED --

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:28.376
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO REMOVE

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:28.977
THE SECTION ON A PROFESSIONAL

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.712

AND WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:40.888
MECHANISM IS IS -- AND MAKING

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:43.124

RESOLUTION ON IT -- AND WHAT

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.868
THAT AUTUMN A RESOLUTION WOULD

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:57.905
BE -- I'D I CAN SAY BUT AS A SAY

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.240
