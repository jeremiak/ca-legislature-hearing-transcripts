THIRTY TWO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE VAGUE THIS ONE OFTEN. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HERE FOR A HIS FIRST -- CLOTHING BUDGET EXPERIENCE OUR NEW LA JOH MR GAVE CREDIT THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US [inaudible] PERFECT. SO THE FIRST ITEM WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IS ISSUE THIRTY TWO JANITORIAL SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FACILITY. MR THIS ONE OFTEN. YES ALSO WERE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY CLASSES. EXCELLENT TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS AND THEY WILL OPEN UP THE IF THE LA -- HAS COME AS WELL CENTER NIELSEN WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH THIS LAST YEAR. AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG STANDING BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL CONTRACT WITH PRIDE INDUSTRIES ANOTHER ENTITY. ENTER THE PICTURE. AND THEY COMPROMISE WAS ROSS AT FIFTY FIFTY AND NOW I AM INFORMED THAT. ALTHOUGH THIS FIFTY FIFTY IS SUGGESTED TO CONTINUE THAT. GDC ARE CANNOT. FIND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. TO DO THIS JOB. WHY WOULD WE THEN CONTINUE THE? FIFTY FIFTY SO I'LL I'LL SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY AND FOR TURNING OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED. TO THE FIFTY FIFTY MODEL AND WE BELIEVE OUR PROPOSAL DOES PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW PRIDE TO PERFORM ANY DUTIES TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS REMAIN ON FAILED -- BUT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO INCLUDE YOU MEAN YOU PROCEED YOU WOULD GET THE JOB DONE LEAVING POSITIONS VACANT. WHAT WAS LEAVING BAKER? IF THE VISIT OF GOD PLEASE. CRYSTALS ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE FILLING THOSE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS AND US YOU SEE OUR CONTINUES -- TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS -- BUT AS YOU ALLUDED. TO ALTERNATELY -- THERE ARE VACANCIES CURRENTLY AND THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY IS SO THAT THE PRIDE CONTRACT -- COULD FULFILL THOSE WORKLOAD ACTIVITIES WALL THOSE POSITIONS ARE BEING FILLED. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE SOME LANGUAGE THAN IN THE BUDGET IF SAYING THAT IN EFFECT. PRIDE INDUSTRIES WILL FILL THOSE POSITIONS THEN THOSE ADDITIONAL ABOVE 50% POSITIONS UNTIL SUCH TIME. I THINK -- OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTRACT IS IT ALREADY PROVIDES THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY AS YOU SEE OUR FILL THOSE POSITIONS AND WE TRY TO REACH THAT FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT WHICH IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FOR PRIDE -- THAT WE WOULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT SPLIT I DON'T DISPUTE THAT WOULD GET ME THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS SUCH. IN A CONTRACT. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T ME RIGHT NOW. TO FOLLOW UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD IT IN HERE RIGHT NOW OKAY IT'S JUST AN ISSUE THAT'S TROUBLING LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY. TROUBLING OUT INVOLVED LAST YEAR. HOW IT GOT RESOLVED AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN TODAY SO? JUST TO GET THAT INFORMATION. FOR MORE LAW AND I'M SURE I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THIS WASN'T HEARD AND SEVEN FIVE WHAT WELL BEFORE SENATORS GET A RESPONSE. LET ME CLARIFY JUST PROCEDURALLY NOT EVERY ITEM IS A CHEN DIES IN EVERY SUBCOMMITTEE THAT IS. NOT WHAT WE DO BUT SENATOR KENNEDY ONE AT ONE MEETING AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD IT WHEN I MUST'VE BEEN ROOMS RIGHT. SENATOR SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND -- WE WERE WAITING FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE EXACT QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED AND WE WERE THEN -- WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE CLARIFICATION WE WE ALSO DID NOT WANT TO HAVE -- WORK BEING DONE. BUT THEN WHEN WE WERE AT WHEN WE GOT THE CLARIFICATION THAT THE CONTRACT WAS STRUCTURED SO THAT PRIDE COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. UNTIL THE CDC OUR POSITIONS WERE FILLED -- DID. WE'RE OKAY WITH PRECEDING BUT WE COULDN'T TAKE OUR ACTION SOME OTHER WORDS WITHIN CLOSE IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. BUT NOW WE DO WHICH IS WHY IT'S BEFORE THE WHOLE BODY. METRIC JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPTICS THIS WAS AWKWARD LAST YEAR -- SO WE HAVE SOME. WONDERFUL PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDING A SERVICE. AND THEN WE HAVE A UNION WHO'S SAYING WE WANT TO MAKE THOSE UNIONIZE POSITIONS WHICH ROUTE FINANCE STANDPOINT IS EXPENSIVE BUT BUT IT DISPLACES YOU KNOW GROUP THAT WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SO I I THINK THE OPTICS. DEPARTMENT FINANCES JUST CONSIDER THE OPTICS IT'S KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WHY. THIS WOULD BE DONE. OUR JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE IN IT IT'S IT'S IT'S SORT OF SIMILAR BUT NOT THE SAME BUT THE ASKED ME FILED A GRIEVANCE WITH THE WESTERN. MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIRED A DIFFERENT GROUP TO TAKE CARE OF THE POISON IVY. ON THE CAMPUS WELL THE FATHER THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE THEY HIRED HER TO GOATS. HIS ARMS KANSEN LET'S JUST LET'S NOT [inaudible] LOOK AWKWARD. WHEN WE WHEN WE DO CERTAIN THINGS SPECIAL PEOPLE LIKE? LIKE PRIDE THIS IS JUST. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IT'S ODD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS TO GET TO THIS SECTION NIELSEN IS THE DURATION THE CONTRACTS TO YOUR CONTRACT. I BELIEVE THE TERMS THE CONTRACTOR STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION. OKAY [inaudible] AND HOW. A CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE IN FACT FILLED BY PRIDE. IT'S A DURING THE TIME THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN PRODUCE OF THIS YEAH YOU CANNOT PRODUCE THE INDIVIDUALS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HAPPENS HOW DO YOU REPORT TO US IT IS THIS IS GETTING DONE YOU SAY THE JOB GET DONE OKAY? WE NEED TO KNOW THAT FOR SURE. HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT WE KNOW? THAT THAT JOB IS DONE. I PORTION LITTLE HARD BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS CAME DOWN EITHER I WAS MUCH MORE VOCAL LAST YEAR. JUST POWER PLAY BY UNION OKAY SIMPLE. AND DISABLED PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED BECAUSE OF SO LET'S GET SOME ANSWERS. THE ADMINISTRATION FULLY INTENDS ON IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED LAST YEAR TO GET TO THAT FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT. AND ULTIMATELY WITH CDC ARE CARRYING SOME VACANCY IS THAT WORK STILL NEEDS TO GET DONE IN ORDER. FOR US TO BEING -- FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE AND WITH LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND SO. BRIGHT HAS YEAH BUT KERRY THAT WORK FOR THE LAST SEVERAL -- A COUPLE YEARS AND AND THEREFORE AS WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND AGAIN MOVING FORWARD -- IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTION THIS WILL PROVIDE IT SHE SHE ALWAYS CARRIES HUNDREDS. A POSITIONS TO OUR SAVINGS ARE THESE POSITIONS TRADE AND CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE FUNCTION HERE. ARE THEY JUST GENERAL. ON FILL POSITIONS DR. THAT YOU HAVE STAFF. FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS ARE ARE TRAINED TO CARRY OUT THE DUTIES BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH PRIDE HAS BEEN A A GOOD ONE AND THAT THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL -- EXPERTISE -- FOR SOME OF THE SERVICES. SENATOR BAIL FOLLOWED BY THIRTY SKINNER -- ENGINE -- MEMBERS I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR I FIND THE CURRENT PROPOSAL CONSISTENT. WITH WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR. AND I SUPPORT THE PROPOSED BUDGET TO A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US -- SO I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE GREEN IT WAS LAST YEAR. I SUPPORT IT I WANTED TO SAY THAT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION -- THE THE WHOLE POLICY THAT THE STATE HAS ON NON OUR SPECIAL -- WORK FORCE PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR WORK FORCE FOR THE STATE THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP A SOCIAL NEEDS. OF DIVERSE -- ABILITIES WORKFORCE POLICY. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE CLARITY ON HOW THEY CAN BE INVOLVED IN THE WORK FORCE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN VARIOUS WAYS SO I THINK THAT SO. THAT'S THIS IS CONSISTENT ARE YOU I WOULD SUPPORT THIS RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'LL TAKE THAT AS A MOST OF SENATOR BAIL SENATOR SKINNER. YES I APPRECIATE -- MY SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SENATOR BILLS CLARIFICATION ON IT NOW I SHOULD'VE INCLUDED INTO MY ANSWER. PRIOR THAT. ARE JUST REMINDER TO THE COMMITTEE THAT IT WAS OUR SUBCOMMITTEE THAT. FIVE BASICALLY ADOPTED THE ACTION THAT ENABLE TO PRY TO HAVE 50% OF THE POSITIONS AND ENABLE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THIS WAS LAST YEAR. AND WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN FURTHER ASSURED THAT THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK WHICH OF COURSE THAN WAS ADOPTED BY THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ADOPTION OF LAST YEAR IS BEING CONTINUED. SO. WITH THAT I ALSO SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. XENON LA -- ANY COMMENT. MAYBE CALL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCERNS THIS PROPOSAL APPRECIATE THAT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. THIRTY TWO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE I WILL -- TAKE MISTER BILLS COMMENT AS A MOTION AND AGAIN THE MOTION IS APPROVED AS BUDGET PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MITCHELL HI NIELSEN HI WELL I'D RATHER. HELLO. JONES [inaudible] LEYVA [inaudible] I MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] MY LOCK [inaudible] MARA [inaudible] PAN HI [inaudible] ROTH HI. SKINNER. ALL RIGHT STERN [inaudible] JOHN [inaudible] NUMBER I'VE. HI KATHY I NIELSEN I DON'T KNOW. THE CASE. THAT. WITH A VOTE OF THIRTEEN THE FOR THAT MEASURE KERRY'S MOVING ON TO ISSUE. FORTY THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSION IN ADVANCE PAYMENT [inaudible] RIGHT. VERY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL. AGAIN COLLEAGUES -- THIS IS ISSUE. FORTY THE EITC EXPANSION. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT IT BE MOVED OVER FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS -- FINANCE I'M SORRY ALL THE MORE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST TAKE JUST A QUICK QUESTION IS IS IS REMOVING INTO THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND IS THAT. THE RATE OF FRAUD IN CALIFORNIA'S 19% FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL LEVEL APPARENTLY IT'S UP SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS BY BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS. ADEQUATE STAFFING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WERE REDUCING THE LEVEL OF FRAUD. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE J. CHAMBERLAIN IN OUR REVENUE UNIT -- SO. HI BUT AND I'VE I'VE NOT HEARD THE STATISTICS OF 90% FRIDAY -- BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THEM BUT WE HAVE. GIVEN -- FRIDGES SEX WORD WRAP A RESOURCES. TO TO VERIFY -- THAT THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT ARE ARE GOING PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY EARNED OF THE THE INCOME AND TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE. THAT THERE ISN'T -- ARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT IT ISN'T YOUR HAVING FRAUDULENT RETURNS WHERE SOMEONE TAKE SOMEONE ELSE SO SECURITY NUMBER FILE SO. OTHERS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF OF WORK AND AND RESOURCES PUT INTO -- PREVENT IT HAPPENING FRAUD AND AND WHICH CALL FRONT THERE'S THERE'S ALSO -- THERE ARE PEOPLE. WHO DO CLAIM -- THE CREDIT. THINKING THAT THE ARE YOU FOR INSTANCE THAT THEY THAT A CHILD. IS A DEPENDENT. BUT MEDIA JOINT CUSTODY CASE THE CHILD MAY BE MAY BE THE DEPENDENT. TECHNICALLY OF THE OTHER PARENT AND SO THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE -- AFTER WE WILL DENY A CREDIT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY THEY DETECT SOMETHING ON THEIR TURN THIS SHOWS THAT THAT. INDIVIDUALS NOT ENTITLED TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BUT I DON'T CONSIDER THAT FRAUD IN THE SENSE THAT THERE THERE'S MONEY GOING OUT -- THAT THAT ISN'T DESERVED UNDER THE CREDIT OR OR COULD JUST SURFACE WHEN WHEN IT RETURNS ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY WHICH IS SHOW UP THAT DAY YOU CAN'T EVEN DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PRESS THE DEPENDENT. YOU KNOW SQUARE RIGHT SO TRY BOUNCING OUT AUTOMATICALLY BUT I JUST WONDER IF. IF THAT THE LEVELS ARE THAT HIDE IT THAT THEY'RE SAYING IT'S 40% AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND YET IT'S A LOAN. NATIONWIDE IS IS I UNDERSTAND. IT SO BUT BUT THAT'S THAT THAT MEANS THERE'S COMMITTEE AT AN ADDED EFFORT TO LOOK AT THOSE. CREDIT SO WHICH MEANS THAT MAY BE. A LOT OF OUR LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A TAX AUDIT I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING. IF THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE A LOT OF PEOPLETHAT SHOULD BE TAKING THE CREDIT FROM DOING SO IF THAT. IS HAPPENING. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE -- A FULL TAX AUDIT IT WOULD BE MORE -- AN ANALYSIS OF THE TAX RETURN TO SEE IF. IF THEY HAVE ALL ALL THE CRITERIA AND THE THEY CAN YOU KNOW. IF THEY'VE GOT A AS A A QUALIFIED DEPENDENT QUALIFY INDEPENDENT OR MAYBE THEY'RE PREPARING IT MANUALLY THEN AND THE RATS WITH A TRIBUTE BECAUSE IF THERE WERE ELECTRONIC IT PROBABLY WOULD SELF CORRECT I WOULD [inaudible] SHE WHICH WOULD SORT ALL CASES BUT GENERALLY I THINK. THE FOR WHAT HAPPENED USE A PAID TAX PREPARER TO ORDER OR TURBOTAX OR SOMETHING. OKAY I I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF SEE MADAM CHAIR THAT. IT IS WE TRY TO DO GOOD THINGS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE FIND THAT SOME PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT THAT OFFICE AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE GETS CAUGHT IN THE NET NUMBERS. GET LETTERS IN WOULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE US THE FOLLOWING IN. THAT JUST SCARES A LOT OF PEOPLE AS WELL. THANK YOU VENTURE. N. S. INTERESTED IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT WE ARE AT LEAST BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CERTAINLY SHARE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERN TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE TRYING -- TO CIRCUIT INTEGRITY OF OUR EITC IT AGAIN I THINK -- MULTIPLE PEOPLE OF NOTED THAT IT'S THE MOST SUCCESSFUL -- MAYBE JUDGE THE SUCCESSFUL -- YOU KNOW INNOVATION THE TRIED AND TRIED -- TO TO HELP -- DRESS -- POVERTY BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE IRS HAS SAID PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED. THAT ESSENTIALLY THE OVER PAYMENT RATE IS ABOUT 2226% SO THAT'S NOT NESTLE OFF FRAUD EITHER SO I'M NOT SURE THE 40% CAME FROM. BUT THE IRS SAID 2226% OF OVER PAYMENTS AND THE THEY NOTE THAT MOST OF THE ERRORS ARE RESULTING FROM -- YELLED COMPLEXITY THE RULES AND AIRS AND FILING SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE THIS IS NOT INTENTIONAL. NECESSARILY -- SO I I THINK BY I WANT. TO BE SURE THAT WERE USING ACTION INFORMATION TRYING MAKE POLICY THANK YOU. PERFECT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BELIAU ANY COMMENT. ABOUT WILL OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] ISSUE. pMADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY.

I. T. C. -- WITH -- THE ANNOTATED CHANGES WE HAVE A MOTION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MITCHELL. HI. NO. DRAWS UP. HER TARA. JONES. LEYVA AYE MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] WARLOCK THEY LARA. CAN I RUN. GONNA DRIVE STERN [inaudible] STONE [inaudible] NUMBER [inaudible] I CASKEY [inaudible] HI. WE'LL LEAVE THAT ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE FORTY ONE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS SO. SO FOR OUR DMV PROPOSAL WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THERE ARE CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS. THEIR OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS CHANGES TO OUR IT SYSTEMS AND INCREASING TEMPORARY POSITIONS AND SUPPORT FOR THE INCREASE IN REAL ID DEMAND AT DMV FIELD OFFICES. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL. QUESTIONS ON THE DMB PROPOSAL ELLIE. BUT LET ME HAVE THE LA ALKALINE ELIA. THE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- NO COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE EXCELLENT SENATOR NIELSEN. QUESTION OF THE YOU PROVIDE PER PER PER PROPOSING A FURTHER OVER DRAFT IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. THE FUNDS. AND SUSPENDING SOME CONSTRUCTION. AS WOULD BE NECESSARY -- WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S A NEED TO SUSPEND THESE [inaudible] SAFETY IMPROVEMENT. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ACCIDENT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT REQUIRES A? WE BASICALLY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT WE BASICALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO FIND INCLUDING THIS TEMPORARY SPIKE IN REAL ID. WHILE ENSURING THAT THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT IS SOLVE AND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. MEN ARE DEPARTMENT FINNCE -- IN TERMS OF THAT WE DO OUR PROPOSAL DOES KEEP HIM OUT OF IT VEHICLE ACCOUNTS ALL THAT AND WE DON'T PROPOSE WE PROPOSE SHIFTING -- THESE PROPOSALS FROM CASH FUNDED AND THE A TO PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND IN ORDER TO KEEP A MOVE. MOVING FORWARD SO IN FACT YOU'RE JUST PUTTING FORTH THE RESERVE THERE CORRECT. OUR PROPOSAL MAINTAIN FEEL IF YOU WILL. WHAT WOULD YOU CAUGHT? FIFTY WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN BOTH FIND THIS TEMPORARY SPIKE AND WORKLOAD AT DMV FIELD OFFICES AS WELL AS MOVE FORWARD WITH. FUNDING -- SOME CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS ON A CASH BASIS AND SOME ON A PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND BASIS TO OUT THE PROJECTS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND IS IS IT BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THE REAL ID BECAME SUCH A FIASCO. THE NOW THAT [inaudible] TO READ. YOU GOT TO BACKFILL SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE OF THAT THERE OR OR DIFFICULTY JEALOUSY. THE THE REAL ID PROPOSAL IS THE REAL ID Là IS A FEDERAL LAW THAT -- WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND THE DEADLINE. FOR IT TO FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE A REAL ID BEFORE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FLY IS OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS FOR THAT PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA WEREN'T. FINALIZING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN EVEN THE LAW WAS PASSED PRIOR TO THAT SO WE DO HAVE TO ADJUST TO THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. IT AND HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR STAND NOW AND AS FAR AS THIS BUDGET IS TO STERN. CONCERN PROCEEDING WITH. THE COMPLETION THE REAL ID THAT'S A LONG AND COMPLICATED. AND BECOME MORE COMPLICATED ACTUALLY. SO WE RECOGNIZE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THERE WERE CHALLENGES WITH REAL ID AND THEN THERE ARE CHALLENGES AT THE DMV MORE BROADLY THAT ARE AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS IMPENDING DEADLINE. NEXT YEAR SO THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE SUGGESTING ARE PROPOSING FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT ARE BASICALLY TO PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO THE NEXT TWO YEARS. A LOT OF IT DRIVEN BY REAL ID BUT NOT ALL OF THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW EVEN WHEN RELY DE EVEN WHEN WE GET THROUGH IF AND WHEN WE GET TO THAT DEADLINES WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN. PEOPLE COME TO THESE FIELD OFFICES THEY KNOW WHAT DOCUMENTS THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BRING IN THEIR NOT SENT HOME AND CAN NEED TO COME BACK AGAIN. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN SWIPE THEIR CREDIT CARD AT A FIELD OFFICE SO ALL OF THESE TO REQUIRE SOME UP FRONT INVESTMENT AT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THE IMPENDING REAL ID DEADLINE. I'LL JUST BE LABOR THIS IS SECOND IS KIND OF A IN A RATING A COMPLAINT FROM THE FIELD. THAT IN THE OFFICES ONE THERE IS A BREAK TIME. A GIVEN WINDOW. WE'LL BE JUST VACATED. DURING THAT BREAK THERE'S NO ONE TO BACK FILL IT IS AT GENERAL STAFFING POLICY IT BMB. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC pPART OF THESE CHANGES WE ARE INVESTING A LOT IN TRAINING AND MAKING SURE AND NOT JUST MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC OFFICES BUT REGIONAL MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE. THAT PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE THERE. I UNDERSTAND THAT'S DESIRED. THIRTY WILL. FALL BY FILLMORE Là. JUST TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT -- THE TRANSPORTATION -- COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE AS HARD INTENTIONAL STAFF TO WORK JUST SPECIFICALLY ON THE DMV. SO WILL BE DEDICATING A LOT OF ENERGY -- REVIEWING AND WE'RE SUPPORTER OF THE DMV. BUT THE DMV CLEARLY NEEDS TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO MEET TO THE REAL ID WORKLOAD -- WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RESOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATELY. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS AND HAVE THE STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO TRACK. DMV PROGRESS IN MEETING THE CHALLENGE SO STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY BE CRITICAL. AND AFFECTED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE D. V. D. M. V. IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO THAT END THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND IMPROVE IMPLEMENTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON WAIT TIME HIRING TECHNOLOGY -- PROPOSALS AS WELL AS THE DMV'S RESPONSE. THE RESPONSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT. AND THE STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATION WILL BE CRITICAL WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE -- CONCERT REVIEW OF THE DMV -- AND IT IT'S CONCERNING ME THAT THE OCTOBER -- TWENTY TWENTY DATE -- FOR REAL ID -- WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE MONTHLY -- NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT THEY WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN PLACE. AND THE THE BASIC QUESTION IS -- THIS BUDGET PLAN IS BEING SUBMITTED -- WILL IT -- HAVE THE NECESSARY -- ADDITIONAL STAFF AND EFFORT -- WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE FOR REAL ID FOR THE TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT NEED TO RECEIVE THE GRILL ID -- BY OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY IS IS THAT A YES OR IS THAT A NO. I'LL JUST SAY BRIEFLY THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES AND THE FACT THAT BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY IT'S A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND CLOSE TO YOUR NAPA WE'VE GOT TWO SUMMERS AND SUMMERS TYPICALLY WHEN THE DMV FACES. THE MOST DEMAND BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL IS NEARLY TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY TEMPORARY BECAUSE THEY'RE DESIGNED TO MEET THIS NEED SO WE THINK IT'LL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SIMPLE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S WELL DESIGNED TO MEET. THAT NEED WILL ARE YOU MEET THE DEADLINE OF THE TWENTY MILLION. APPLICATIONS BY. OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY IS THIS PLAN IS A PLAN YOU HAVE. WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT THAT'S THE KEY QUESTIONS. THE PLAN WILL ACCOMPLISH IT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS INCLUDING AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY DEBT FIE. BECAUSE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO IF YOU HAVE A PASSPORT YOU DON'T NEED A REAL ID TO FLY YOU BRING YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU -- AND SO IT IS. NOT REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S EVERYONE GET A REAL ID IT IS OPTIONAL BUT WE BELIEVE THAT -- WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES -- FOR TO TO ADDRESS THOSE COMING IN AND PART OF YOUR BILL LANGUAGE MINING WILL. BOTH LEGISLATIVE MINISTRATION CONTINUE TO MONITOR. SO THEN THE QUESTION WOULD BE IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TWENTY TWENTY OCTOBER -- DEADLINE FOR THE TWENTY MILLION -- PEOPLE THAT NEED A REAL REAL ID HOW MANY. REAL IDEA APPLICATION SO YOU CAN COMPLETE BY. TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS YOU'RE RECEIVING. A IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. WINTERS A NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND BUDGET YEAR AT NINE POINT THREE MILLION IN BUT YEAR PLUS ONE THE PROXIMATE QUARTER OF THAT WOULD BE IN THE FIRST. QUARTER SO. TOP THIRTEEN MILLION. OKAY SO -- SO THE QUESTION IS IN THE OUT YEARS -- THE REAL ID EXTRA TEMPORARY. ALLOCATION WILL CONTINUE. AND WITH WE NEED IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN MONITORING THIS. HOW MUCH CHAU? HOW LONG THAT ADDED REVENUE WILL BE NEEDED? AND WHEN WILL THAT -- THAT OUT THE REQUESTED OF THE LEGISLATURE. BE REDUCED AT SOME POINT I IMAGINE WHEN YOU START TO TAIL DOWN. THE REAL ID EXPANSION IS SPECIAL EXPENDITURES AS I KHôNG. OUR PROPOSAL DOES HAVE THE HIGHEST RESOURCES IN BUDGET YEAR AND IT IT DOES RAMP DOWN DRAMATICALLY AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU AND I THINK THE I APPRECIATE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I'M A SUPPORTTHE RECOMMENDATION MANAGER WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION -- OR MAYBE A FOLLOW P BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE INCREASED COSTS FOR THE DMV. THAT THAT A PART OF THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WAIVE THE MERCHANT FEAR THE CREDIT CARD CONVENIENCE FEE WHEN THEY USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS IS THAT CORRECT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO ACTUALLY PASS ON THAT FEE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT SEVERAL OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS -- TO TO THE PERSON AT THE DMV -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT WITH THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S CONTINUING CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT [inaudible] CHAU. I IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WAVE. CONVENIENCE FEES WHEN I WAS A COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR SO I'M WONDERING DO YOU NEED LANGUAGE IN YOUR TRAILER BILL TO ALLOW THE DMV TO WAIVE. THAT POLICE HAD SORT OF A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. AND SO DO. A RE IF BARBIE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT IN IN IN. YOUR TRAILER BILL SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT WAIVE THOSE FEES -- IT PASSES THEM ON TO THE PERSON APPLYING FOR THAT RELY DEAR ENOUGH FOR ANY SORT OF BAD TRANSACTIONS OR CREDIT CARD. TO THEM MY FIRST QUESTION THE ANSWER IS THEY THEY ARE NOT BEING WAIVED CORRECT YES OKAY SO THEN I JUST HAD THAT INFORMATION. BUT THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OKAY I THINK IT COMES WITH IT. TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE THOSE SHADED. SO I I'D SPEAKING WITH THAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IDEAS AROUND THIS. IT WOULD BE NICE TO WORK WITH VISA AND SAY HEY WE WERE GOVERNMENT WE'RE NOT A STORE COMPETING WITH OTHER STORES. WATCH GIVES A GOVERNMENT CONVENIENCE FEE RATE WHICH IS LIKE SHOULD BE LIKE. POINT 1% SET UP TWO OR 3% IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO GET. GIVE YOUR HATS A LOT OF MONEY -- BUT IF IF WE'RE WORKING ON PRESCRIPTIONS AND PHARMACY BECAUSE THAT'S FOR CURRENT. VISA COSTS TO WITH THE POWER OF ALL OF OUR MUNICIPALITIES TO KIND OF MAKE A DENT IN THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SYNONYME OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

MR MADAM CHAIRMAN AND CHAIRWOMAN AND ENATORS THERESA START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE US SENATE VERSION TODAY AROUND THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN THE SUBSIDIES IN PARTICULAR I WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR THE LANGUAGE AROUND HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AS IT IS A REALLY% IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND IT WILL PROVIDE -- IMPORTANT AND ROBUST COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON A JENNIFER ALI WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS WE ALSO -- SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE EXPANSION THE SUBSIDIES THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS CUT THE MUSTER WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS A CALIFORNIA WESUPPORT THE SENATE MOTION TODAY NURTURES PART. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS ROSANNA CURVATURE HERE BEHALF OF THE LINES OF HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AS WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON ISSUE. FORTY TWO WHICH WILL EXCLUDE HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AS FROM THE EXEMPTIONS TO THE MANDATE REQUIREMENTS. SPECIFICALLY THE HEALTH OF THE ALLIANCE OF HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IT REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE REJECT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO EXCLUDE THE EXEMPTION TO THE MANDATE REQUIREMENT. AND INSTEAD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE MAY REVISE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH. FEDERAL LAW HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS OUR WAY FOR COMMUNITIES OF ALL FAITHS -- WHERE MEMBERS HELP OTHER MEMBERS WITH THE COSTS OF MEDICAL NEEDS THE ALLIANCE MEMBERS HAVE OVER THREE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AND FACILITATE MONTHLY SHARING OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MEDICAL NEEDS AMONGST THEIR MEMBERS -- HEALTHCARE SHARING IT HAS BEEN. AROUND IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE AMISH AND MENNONITES ARE THEY ARE THE BEST KNOWN PRACTITIONERS OF HEALTH CARE SHARING. AND THE DRAFTERS OF THE ACA RECOGNIZE THIS -- AS A VIABLE WAY TO ADDRESS HEALTHCARE COSTS BY EX INCLUDING THEM IN THE EXEMPTIONS AND THE FEDERAL MANDATE REQUIREMENTS. THE HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS JUST ONE OF NINE EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE A. C. A. I. SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN MARCH OF TWENTY TEN THE EXEMPTION FOR SHARING MINISTRIES -- IS NOT A CREATION OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JUST BY -- ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID IN THE PAST -- AND THEN IN ADDITION THEIR OR THEIR FIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE -- AN EXEMPTION AND OF HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AS THEY MUST BE NONPROFIT THEY MUST SHARE A COMMON SET OF ETHICS ETHICAL OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND SHARE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THEY ARE MUST RETAIN MEMBERSHIP EVEN AFTER A MEDICAL CONDITION IS DEVELOPED -- THEY AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE AT ALL TIMES SINCE DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF NINETY NINE WHICH AS YOU KNOW WAS PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THEY ALSO MUST CONDUCT AN ANNUAL -- INDEPENDENT ON IT AND THEN LASTLY CMS HHS AND I IN THE IRS ALL HAD TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA -- ONE OF THOSE WAS THAT CMS AND HHS HAVE TO CERTIFY THAT -- HEALTHCARE SCHERING MINISTRIES WERE EXEMPT FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH OF THE ALLIANCE OF HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AS HAVE THOSE CERTIFICATION LETTERS FROM CMS IN A TREE SAYS. ON THEIR WEBSITE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. TO ELIMINATE THE EXEMPTION OF THE MANDATE PENALTY FOR HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY IS AND AGAIN REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. BUT A LOT OF SPORTS [inaudible] LAST. ELIMINATES EXEMPTION. FOR HELP FOR YOUR NATIONAL BUSINESS MODEL YEAR. CAN WE HAVE A RESPONSE FOR STAFF TO THAT LAST -- DOCTOR PAN CERTAINLY IT WAS HURTING YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE DOCTOR PANEL RESPOND YES THANK YOU AND I THE FISH INCREASE SHAPE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THIS ISSUE I THINK THE THE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN -- THAT -- DESPITE THE SECTIONS THAT BASICALLY FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE STANDARDS THAT WE SET AN ANSWER FORCED BY THE FARM AND HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WHEN WE SAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY. PREMIUMS THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PLANS ARE THERE WHEN -- WHEN THEY NEED THEM RIGHT SO YOU ARE PAYING INTO A? POOL ARE YOU PAYING IT FOR INSURANCE YOU ON BE SURE THAT SERVICES THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AND AND HONORED THE ESSENTIALLY THE CONTRACT NOW THE CHALLENGE WITH HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES. CERTAINLY THEY ARE NOT INSURANCE. BUT THEY ARE IS A CLICK MEMBERSHIP FEES AND THEN THEY AND DATE PAY FOR SOME THE HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THE MEDICAL. BILLS WILL BE SHARED ARE PAID AND SO THE CHALLENGE HERE IS IS THAT -- THAT IN THAT -- HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE TO MEET -- THE SAME KIND OF STANDARDS OR EVEN CLOSE IN TERMS OF ENSURING DEFICIT FISCAL VIABILITY AND DISABILITY AND THERE'S A BIG CONCERN IS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT BY THE WAY WHENEVER YOU HAVE AN ENTITY THAT SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE -- COVERAGE WHEN SOMEONE PAYS INTO IT WHATEVER IT IS -- THAT IF WHEN THEY COLLAPSE OR THEIR NINETY WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS THAT EXPENSE ENDS UP BEING PASSED ON TO ALL THE REST OF US BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. THAT ENTITY WHETHER IT'S INSURANCE COMPANY OR HAVE CHEMISTRY THEY CAN'T PAY OUT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY OUT. THEN WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE COVERAGE THE FULL STILL BE SICK THEY'LL SHOW UP IN THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY. NO GO BANKRUPT BUT THEN THE THE THE EXPENSE GETS SPREAD OUT AMONGST EVERYONE ELSE SO I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE BEHIND -- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE -- COVERAGE THAT IS THERE AND AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND SO AND FORTY BECAUSE HEALTH CARE% MINISTRIES DO NOT FIT IN THE CONTEXT. OF ANY SORT OF FEEL THEY'RE NOT REGULATED -- THE THEY'RE NOT THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT UNLIKE WHAT WE REQUIRE FOR HEALTH PLANS AND THEY OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TO US HERE IN THIS VERY ROOM BUT THEY THEY HAVE TO MEET -- VERY YES THEY HAVE TO MEET -- FISCAL RESERVE REQUIREMENTS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ASSURE THAT THEY ARE PRESENT AND SO AT WE DO NOT FEEL THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO INCUDE ENTITIES THAT DID NOT HAVE THOSE -- THOSE PROTECTIONS -- TO TO COUNT -- AS AS HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PANTHER MORLOCK. SO I'M JUST CREATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT STATISTICS EARLIER TODAY -- TOO WE HAVE ANY. ORGANIZATION OF THIS NATURE THAT'S ACTUALLY. DEFAULTED RUBIO TWENTY YEARS OF HISTORY I'M JUST IF WE HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT HASN'T HAD A THE PROBLEM I'M I'M WONDERING WHY. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD SPUR. SOMETHING DISTRICT ADDICTS. WELL I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL -- IT MAINLY WE DON'T HAVE -- THAT WHILE THERE ARE SO I THINK THERE'S ONE COMPANY THAT MARKETS THE CALIFORNIANS WITH -- CALIFORNIA HASN'T HAD -- THAT MANY HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES IN OUR STATE -- THEY ARE MORE EXISTENCE AND OTHER PLACES BUT THERE AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME. BUT I THINK IT WAS CERTAINLY HEARD STORIES WHERE AGAIN SO FORGET THIS IS NOT INSURANCE SO WHAT HAPPENS THEY DON'T PROMISE THAT -- THE MEDICAL BILLS CAN BE PAID SO NOT TRULY COOPERATED IS I'M SURE THEY WERE RE INSURANCE TO COVER YEAH SO RIGHT SO HE TO TO THE CHALLENGES OF WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN'T COVER THAT ARE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO COVER. THAT THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PERSON WHO NEEDS CARE SPECIALLY FAIRLY EXPENSIVE CARE INSURANCE COMPANIES DO THAT TO YOU TOO WELL ACTUALLY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH CARE SO THEY CAN ONLY DENY CERTAIN THINGS AND IN FACT IF THEY DENY YOU -- AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL TO TEAMMATES SEE -- TO SAY LOOK YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THIS IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY I NEED TO HAVE THIS COVERAGE SO WE HAVE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO PROTECT PEOPLEWHEN THEY BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. I'M NOT SAYING TO ALWAYS PERFECT BUT WE HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS AND THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY FILE -- WITH THAT WITH THE REGULATOR PROOF OF THAT THEY HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESERVES AND SO FORTH -- THESE MINISTRIES DO NOT AND SO WE DON'T WE WE DO NOT -- NO OTHER DAY ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND THEY MAY BE HOPING THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T GET REALLY SICK. SO THEN ONCE YOU HAVE A FIVE YEAR PHASE IN TO SAVE YOUR YOU GOT A STARTED ACTING TO A REGULATORY MODEL AS OPPOSED TO JUST CUT THEM OFF. WELL CERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION WITH US ABOUT SAYING THAT THEY SEEK OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION BY TEAMMATES SEE SENATOR JONES. I'M SORRY -- SIR MARK READ READ AND I WANT TO CUT YOU OFF YOUR HONOR. I'M SORRY -- THE MANAGER I AM I AM AM HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW AND THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS. AND THE THE INFORMATION WE'RE RECEIVING FROM THE DíAS. I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THESE MEDICAL SHARE PROGRAMS AT BY ANY MEANS. I AM VAGUELY FAMILIAR WITH SOME. I'M CONCERNED THAT -- I MEAN I I JUST I'M. FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NO OVERSIGHT. OR THAT THERE'S NO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION ON THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO RIDE THE MEDICAL COVERAGE THAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT THEY DO COVER. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE MIGHT BE GETTING INTO SOME RELIGIOUS FREEDOM -- CHALLENGES HERE IN SOME FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGES -- ON THE U. S. CONSTITUTION SO I'M GONNA VOTE NO ON THAT THIS IS RIFE WITH -- POTENTIAL LEGAL PROBLEMS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS FULLY COOKED RIGHT NOW. AND I'M GOING TO VOTE NO I'M AND ENCOURAGE THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO. AND HAVE ENCOURAGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AN APARTMENT FINANCE TO COME BACK. WITH MORE ANSWERS -- THAT I THINK IS CENTER MORALE BROUGHT UP. THAT WERE NOT -- COMPLETELY ANSWERED FROM THE DíAS -- THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU. SO LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT THE THIS IS NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S. THIS ELEMENT IS NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OKAY THIS IS A PART OF THE SENATE PROPOSALS IN TERMS OF WHO WERE MAYBE WE NEED TO GET OUR DUCKS IN A ROW. TO SOLVE BUT LET ME JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT -- WHEN OUR DUCKS INITIALLY SURFACED OF THIS WAS HEARD ALL ADDITIONALLY IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND FULL BUDGET HEARING IT WAS REFERENCED OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD IT ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T TAKE ACTION? MARCH TWENTY FIRST I JUST WOULD BE CLEAR THAT THIS ISSUE HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WALLY DIDN'T TAKE ACTION UNTIL TODAY -- I OUR DUCKS HAD BEEN OUT THERE. THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FIRST TIME HEARING ABOUT IT -- MY READ MY CONCERNS REMAIN THE SAME OF THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM -- CONCERNS THE FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS AND MY APOLOGIES TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY CENTER MORLOCK WHO I KNOW IS NOT CENTER MORALE BECAUSE HE'S. THERE'S A QUITE A BIT OF A DIFFERENT. WEBSITE THANK YOU. GOT IT -- SENATOR ROBB AND THEN BACK TO THIRD OF PANTHERA. THANK YOU MAYOR RICHARD DID I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO MY COLLEAGUES DO WE KNOW. WITH RESPECT TO THESE RELIGIOUS MINISTRIES IF THE IF THE PARTICIPANTS ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE USE HOSPITALS. OR IF THAT'S AGAINST THEIR RELIGIOUS TENANTS IN FACT THEY PROVIDE THIS HEALTHCARE AMONG THE COMMUNITY. SO I WOULD FIRST OF ALL I POINT OUT THAT -- THIS -- WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET DOES NOT ACTUALLY BANNER ELIMINATE. THESE MINISTRIES -- WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THE HEALH CARE MINISTRY DOES NOT COUNT IN TERMS OF -- MEETING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FOR COVERAGE SO SOMEONE CAN STILL DO IT TAKE THE PENALTY AND STILL HAVE A HEALTH CARE MINISTRY RIGHT -- THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT I MEAN THERE VARIETY DIFFERENT ONE SO YOU ASKING QUESTIONS IT DEPENDS. IT DEPENDS AND SO AS I MENTIONED THEY'RE NOT REGULATED THEY DON'T DOWN THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES IN PLACE IN THE FIELD FEDERAL AGENCY ABOUT BUT I MEAN OTHER WITH THE TERMS OF WHAT TO WRITE WHAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED BUT THEY'RE NOT REGULATED. AND SO THE CHALLENGE AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY MOST RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY. USE INSURANCE THEY DON'T USE HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE INSURANCE THEY PROVIDE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR MINUTES YOU KNOW THAT THE MEMBERS WHAT AT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE FOLKS WHO WORK FOR THEMSELVES. THIS IS THIS IS AND WE'RE NOT BANNING THEM AT THIS IS NOT THE MAIN MECHANISM BY WHICH MOST PEOPLE GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE EVEN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO I I I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT WHAT BEING SURE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. PEOPLE HAVING COVERAGE THE DATE WE ARE SURE THAT THEY HAVE FORM OF COVERAGE THAT MEETS THE STANDARD ENSURES THAT THEY WILL HAVE -- THAT THE STANDARDS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA.% MEDICAL TO CLARIFY JUST ONE SECOND. ON THE DOG GO -- TO BACK YOU MISTER JONES AND THEN YOU SAID A ROCK BUT TO CLARIFY. THE ACTIONS BEING FOR POLLS DON'T THURMOND. THE HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES -- IT EXCLUDED EXEMPTS THEM FROM [inaudible] THE MANDATE. GOT IT ALL RIGHT LET ME GO BACK TO MISTER JONES AND THEN BACK TO SIT AROUND I APOLOGIZE A SINNER UP I THINK I KINDA IS THAT NOT ESSENTIALLY A BAND. AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT NOW BECAUSE THE BAND WOULD SAY THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE THE HEALTH CARE MINISTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE A BAND OKAY THAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU YOU CAN STILL HAVE. BE A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES BUT YOU MUST ALSO ACCORDING TO THE PORTABLE CARE ACT. HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WELL WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS IS THAT BASICALLY IF IN ORDER. TO ADD THAT THE TERMS OF A WHETHER YOU'D BE A PENALTY WOULD BE APPLIED -- UNDER DATE REQUIREMENT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT'S IN THE FEDERAL LAW WE'RE PUTTING A STATE PENALTY IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SAY THAT YOU DO NOT. THAT YOU WILL NOT GET A PENALTY -- AND WE WILL EXCLUDE BEING SAYING THAT YOU HAVE YOUR MEMBER HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES SO BE A MEMBER THE HEALTH CARE MINISTRY WOULD NOT. QUALIFY IS BEING EXEMPT FROM THE PENALTY -- THERE'S NOTHING THE BAND THE MINISTRIES THEY CAN STILL EXIST -- BUT YOU CAN'T IN YOUR TAX BY STATE TAX FILING SAY THAT WELL I WAS A MEMBER HEALTHCARE MINISTRY THEREFORE I AM EXEMPTED FROM THE PENALTY - SO THAT IS THE WITH THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT'S WHY THIS IS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THIS -- THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PORTION OF THE THIS BILL SO NOW I'M NOW I'M. ALERTED TO AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE -- SO I'LL GO BACK TO SO TWO THINGS BACK TO UNREGULATED I MEAN I JUST FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO ZERO REGULATIONS. ON THESE TYPE OF SYSTEMS WHEN THE ACA RECOGNIZES THEM AS A AS A PROPER -- MEDICAL COVERAGE TOOL FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY USE THESE -- BUT I KNOW IT'S A MARKET RESPONSE TO THE ACA THAT THE ACA KNOWLEDGES OKAY SO NOW LET'S GO BACK TO THE THE LAST POINT THE DOCTOR PAN MADE. ON THE ON THE TAX RETURNS OKAY SO NOW WE'VE GOT AS A TOOL THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE RES OF THE COUNTRY. THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE ON YOUR IRS TAX FORMS THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW SAYING ON OUR TAX FORMS WE'RE NOT GOING TO RECOGNIZE IT AND IT'S NOT. AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS -- BUT ON OUR FEDERAL TAX FORMS IT IS SO EIGHT AGAIN I JUST GO BACK TO THE THIS IS THIS IS GOT ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS -- AND I'M I'M. I WILL LET MAKE AS MY FINAL COMMENT I'M STILL VOTING NO APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST A DEPEND IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A FEDERAL MANDATE. HELLO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ACTUALLY. CONGRESS VOTED. TO ELIMINATE THE PENALTY ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SO TECHNICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS CONGRESS ACTED IN THE PRESIDENT SIGNED. A BILL THAT STILL RETAIN THE MANDATE ITSELF BUT MADE THE PENALTY ZERO SO THERE'S NO PENALTY SO -- SO THERE'S NO SO IN THIS CASE IF ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH -- I THINK BELIEVE UNDER A TRAILER BILL IF CONGRESS WOULD RESTORE THE PENALTY AGAIN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A STEEP PENALTY AND THE MINISTRY I GUESS WITH TOWN UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THERE'S NO REGULATORY BODY THAT REALLY THERE ARE STANDARDS IN THE LAW THAT IS NO REGULATORY BODY THAT OVERSEES -- THESE HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- YOU'RE OUT OF DIFFERENCE TO MY FELLOW -- BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR WHOSE FORMER EXPERT IN THESE AREAS AND I AM. I'M GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE THIS UP TO TODAY BUT I I WOULD LIKE PERSONALLY TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE. I GUESS WE'D SAY GRANULARITY ON THIS ISSUE -- AS IT MOVES TO CONFERENCE -- IS TO THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS ON THE SINCE IT HAS APPARENTLY BEEN A CONSIDER TO BE COVERAGE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL HOW MANY. FOLKS ARE COVERED IN THESE PARTICULAR. ASSURING MINISTRIES WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE IN. AND REALLY WHAT THE IMPACT ON THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS IF IF IN FACT. THERE LARGELY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WHO TREAT THEIR OWN AND DON'T TO DON'T -- TO BELIEVE IN ATTENDING HOSPITALS AND AND THE LIKE SO. I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR TO MOVE IT UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME THAT IT WILL BE IN CONFERENCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ACTION THE ASSEMBLY TOOK. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION -- WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT THAT IS THE MOTION IS. ON ISSUE. FORTY TWO THANK YOU THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE. PALM AND IT IS DETAILED ON PAGE FORTY THE AGENDA.
