WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF. SO YOU'RE YOU MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO SIT THROUGH A CONFIRMATION WITH YOU. WITH THAT I'M GOING TO LOOK TO MY LEFT AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD- SENATOR GROVE ARE YOU PREPARED. A YES MANAFORT AND THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS MONTGOMERY HOW ARE YOU TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER GROVE I'M VERY WELL THANK YOU. GET I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT YOU GAVE TO SENATOR LAYERED. ABOUT HOW YOU CAME. TO THIS POSITION AND SUPPORTING THEM. YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY FARMERS BUT ALSO IMMIGRANT FARMWORKER FAMILIES THAT WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE HAVE THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD. AND I THINK FOOD SECURITY IS A BIG ISSUE IN OUR FARMWORKERS- ARE A KEY PART OF MAKING THAT HAPPEN SO THAT WE HAVE FOOD ON OUR GROCERY STORE SHELVES. SO I REALLY APPRECIATED THOSE COMMENTS I'M GONNA FOCUS A LITTLE BIT TIME ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE YOU GOT THERE. IT IS STILL ON GOING AND GET SOME INFORMATION IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. A FEW YEARS AGO EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. I HELPED A GROUP OF FARMWORKERS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY COME UP TO THE STATE CAPITOL GET THEIR VOICES HEARD- SPECIFICALLY ON A VOTE. THAT THEY WERE WANTING TO DECERTIFY THE UFW WITHIN THIS ORGANIZATION AS- THE ASSEMBLY LOPEZ AND A GROUP OF HER FARMWORKERS AT COLLEAGUES GATHERED SIGNATURES THE FIRST TIME AROUND THIS INTERESTS WERE THROWN OUT- I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT. THEY DIDN'T GIVE UP THEY WANTED FREEDOM AND THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND- SO THEY GATHERED SIGNATURES AGAIN AND THERE WAS AN ELECTION HELD- SUPERVISED BY THE LRB AND DESCEND AT CURRENT DIR DEPARTMENT OF INVESTOR RELATIONS LITTLE BIT ON THAT I THINK SOME OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THE SENATE PRO TEM AND I WERE BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE. AND WE MIGHT RE ENTER SHE MIGHT REMEMBER I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND- COULD YOU. I'M I KNOW LIKE I SAID DID YOU INHERITED THIS CASE. YOU WEREN'T THERE WHEN THE ACTUAL SITUATION WAS GOING ON. BUT COULD YOU LET ME KNOW OR TELL ME WHETHER. YOU SUPPORTED OR OPPOSED THOSE LATINO IMMIGRANT WORKERS- HE WANTED THEIR VOTES COUNTED. FRIEND THE ELECTION- THAT THE LRB HELD. WELL REALLY I MEAN I THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS. EARLY WHAT. WHAT I BELIEVE IS AT THE HEART OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND WHAT WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING IS- FOR WORKERS TO BE EMPOWERED TO COME TOGETHER AND- I MAKE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR WORKPLACE- FORTY. UNION REPRESENTATION AS WELL AS WORKING CONDITIONS FREE FROM ANY SORT OF INTERFERENCE WHETHER THAT BE FROM EITHER AN EMPLOYER OR UNION OR OR ANY OUTSIDE PARTY SO REALLY THAT I THINK THE HEART OF THE ACT IS TO. ALLOW WORKERS TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE- MAKE A CHOICE- THAT THAT IS LIKE I SAID FREE FROM NOT INTERFERENCE AND SO THAT IS REALLY WHAT OUR PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO GET INTO ENSURE THAT WORKERS. HAVE A VOICE AND THEY CAN EXERCISE. THAT OPTION REALLY SO I WOULD JUST SAY I WASN'T HERE AS YOU POINTED OUT I WAS NOT IN ANY WAY INVOLVED WITH. I DATA. TO WORK IN THE OF THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO IT- HI OR OR EVEN THE CASE- THAT WAS- EDUCATED AT THE LRB THERE AFTER I CAME IN- WHEN IT WAS ALREADY GOING TO THE APPEALS PROCESS. AND SO I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PARTICULAR CASE- SO I DON'T I AM NOT SURE THAT IT'S YOUR QUESTION BUT THAT THAT'S REALLY WHERE I NEED AYE I WAS A PART OF IT I WANT TO PARTY BUT I DO SUPPORT WORKERS- ABILITY TO COME TOGETHER- AND MAKE FREE CHOICES. ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY WANT IN THE WORKPLACE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN I KNOW LIKE I SAID THAT YOU AND THAT YOU WERE NOT HERE- BUT THAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT THE CASE THAT IS STILL ONGOING SO YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE YOUR HANDS IN THAT THAT SITUATION THAT STILL ONGOING. AND WERE YOU AWARE- AND NOT SPECIFICALLY BUT WERE YOU AWARE THAT I'M NOT ASKING FOR COMPLETE DETAILS BUT IT'S VERY WIDELY KNOWN THAT. THE BALLOTS WERE- WERE THREATENED TO BE DESTROYED AFTER THEY WERE- COLLECTED. AND- WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT. NOI'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT THE BALLOTS WERE THREATENED TO BE DESTROYED I KNOW THEY WERE IMPOUNDED AND THAT IS. PART OF THE STANDARD PROCESS OF THE L. CHALLENGE TO THE VALIDITY OF AN ELECTION. THE BALLOTS ARE IMPOUNDED AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED SO I I'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY THREATSOR I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY THREATS OF DESTRUCTION BUT I BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY WERE IMPOUNDED. YOU KNOW HOW ARE THEY THEY WERE IMPOUNDED FOR. THEY WERE IMPOUNDED DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL SO I'VE SEEN I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW LONG THE APPEAL PROCESS TOOK BY. I IT WAYS I BELIEVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WHEN DOES THE SUPREME COURT THE CALPERS REPORT FINALLY TONIGHT HEARING OF THE CASE AND NOT. AND TO THAT MATTER SO THAT HE'S ACTUALLY IS NOT ON GOING- THAT IS CONCLUDED- AND SO I BELIEVE IT WAS UNTIL SOMETIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT THAT THEY WERE IMPOUNDED AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE INITIAL ELECTION HAPPENED AND IN THE FALL OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. YES THE REPUBLIC FIVE YEARS FIVE YEARS OKAY THANK YOU. AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE SPENT ON- THE REQUIRING THESE IN IMMIGRANT FARM WORKERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS- THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY DID. NO I DO NOT. OKAY ESTIMATES THAT I HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTS I HAVE SHOW IT'S OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS SPENT CAN YOU TELL ME F THERE'S ANY MONEY BEING SPENT- ON THIS PROCESS NOW. BUT LIKE I SAID THAT CASE WAS CONCLUDED- AND SO I'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY BEING SPENT ON THE PROCESS THAT SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO THE ELECTION AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ELECTION THERE THERE'S I THINK- AN ONGOING CASE INVOLVING GROWING FARMING- BUT BUT THAT THAT'S IN THE REMEDY PHASE SO JUST TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF REMEDIES NOT NOT SPECIFIC TO THE VALIDITY OF ELECTIONS- ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE- THAT AND FOR LABOR PRACTICE THAT WAS FILED BY EIGHTY- ONE OF THE MINORITY UNION- FARMWORKERS AT GROUND ONE IS THAT THE CASE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE STILL ONGOING HI THERE IS THERE IS A CASE WHERE THERE WAS A FINAL BOARD DECISION ISSUED AS TO LIABILITY AND IT WAS CONCLUSIVELY ADJUDICATED- THAT. THAT THEY ARE WRONG WAS LIABLE FOR SOMEONE FOR LABOR PRACTICES. AND RIGHT NOW WHAT'S WHAT'S PENDING THROUGH THE L. BAHASA SEEDS INSTANCE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE REMEDIES- TO THE WORKER SAID THAT IT THAT IS WHY IT'S ACTUALLY PENDING SO THAT. THE CASE INVOLVING LIABILITIES SPANISH AND WERE IN THE REMEDY PHASE OF THAT MAKES SENSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE I. THINK THERE'S ONE MORE CASEAND I COULD BE WRONG. BUT THERE WAS A- OF ONE OF THE FEW UNION WORKERS AT RON- GOING TO GO BACK DO YOU KNOW THE VOTE OUT CAN. FROM THE VOTES THAT WERE FINALLY COUNTED BY SEN I WAS ACTUALLY IS FIFTH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS THAT. AND THEN WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT TEN THE WORKERS KEPT FIGHTING TILL THEY GOT THE RULING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO COUNT THE BALLOTS THAT THEY VOTED. I'M DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT WAS. YES YES- THE OUTCOME WAS. THAT THE FARMWORKERS VOTED TO DECERTIFY THE UNION. M. WAS IT CLOSE NO IT WASN'T IT WASN'T CLOSE OKAY IT WAS IT WAS AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER BUT IT WAS IT WAS AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. THAT THOUGHT OF THE VOTES CAST- THAT WITH THE DAYBREAK DECERTIFYING SO ONE OF THE MINORITY MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT PER SE THEY WERE TWO SIDES OBVIOUSLY THE MAJORITY OF THEM WANTED TO DECERTIFY THE UFW IN LIFE ALL THE WAY TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT TO GET THAT- THEIR VOTES COUNTED. ONE OF THE MINORITY UNION WORKERS FILED A- FAIRLY FIRST ACCOUNT A COMPLAINT- AND FOR LABOR PRACTICE. AND AGAINST THE U. F. W. NOT THE COMPANY. AND IT WAS ABOUT THE UFW SENT A LETTER OUT TO TH- THREATEN BOYCOTT OF THE FARMING ORGANIZATION AT THE I GUESS THE- THE RETAILERS- I'M ASSUMING YOU KNOW GROCERY STORES THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THEY- HAVE THEIR PRODUCT. V. AS THE THREAT WAS ACTUALLY MADE AGAINST THE FORMER AT AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE THAT THREAT AT BUT THE U. S. W. SOUGHT TO TAKE THAT. DOWN AT- AS UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE AGAINST THE U. F. W. IS THAT CASE STILL ONGOING. I BELIEVE IT'S STILL PENDING AND I. YES I THINK IT'S THAT IS STILL PENDING AND- MAYBE AN ADVANCE RIGHT NOW BUT YES IT'S IT IS PENDING DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. SITTING HERE I DO NOT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A BACK DOOR TO RE OPEN THE VOTE COUNT AND GET THAT BOTH THROWN OUT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT THE CHARGING PARTIES INTENTIONS ARE I DON'T KNOW. AND IS IT UNUSUAL AT AGE EIGHTY A UNION WORKER WHO ACTUALLY HAD A PARTY THE DAY AFTER HE FILED THAT AND FAIR LABOR PRACTICE PARTYING WITH THE U. F. W. AT A BARBECUE WE HAVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO AND IS IT UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE TO FILE AS EARLY FOR PRACTICE AGAINST SOMEONE AND THEN GO TO AN EVENT OR BARBECUE A PARTY WITH HIM AND BE FRIENDS- AND THEN THERE'S NO WAY- THERE'S NO REAL ACTION AGAINST THE U. F. W. BUT IT DOES. OPEN UP THE IDEA THAT YOU GUYS COULD. KEEP THIS CLAIM OPEN AND THROW THOSE FARMWORKERS VOTES OUT IS THAT THE INTENTION IT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE. I'M SORRY HE DIDN'T MENTION THE ELLERBEE'S INTENTION YES IS IT THE ELLERBEE'S INTENTION TO THROW THE FARMWORKER VOTES OUT. I AGAIN I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY. THE STATUS OF A PENDING CASE HI- YEAH I JUST I IF THE CASE IS ONGOING I'M NOT I I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK OF THAT BY. YEAH I- YEAH I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT A PENDING MATTER JUST BECAUSE- BOB WALL CASES ARE PENDING WE HAVE HOUSE CONFIDENTIALITY. SO M. IN WHEN WE DO LEGISLATION THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED LEGISLATIVE INTENT LIKE THE LEGISLATORS INTENT ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATION- CAN I ASK YOU FIFTY ELLERBEE'S INTENT AFTER NOW I BELIEVE EIGHT YEARS OF FIVE YEARS THE BALLOT BALLOTS WERE LOCKED AT TWO TIMES THE FARMWORKERS THESE IMMIGRANT FARMWORKERS GOT SIGNATURES. IN ORDER TO HAVE A VOTE CAST THE FIRST SET OF SIGNATURES WERE THROWN OUT BY THE LRB. THIS AT A SIGNATURE WERE EXCEPT. THEY SET UP A- A VOTE SO THE FARMWORKERS COULD VOTE. IT WAS OVERSIGHT BY THE LRB AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INVESTOR RELATIONS SO. THEY COULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS DONE THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EVEN AFTER ALL THAT THE BALLOTS WERE LOCKED UP FOR FIVE YEARS IT TOOK TWO COURT CASES INCLUDING ONE AT THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA. TO ORDER THOSE BALLOTS TO BE COUNTED ON BEHALF OF THOSE FARMWORKERS. AND EIGHT WHEN I GO BACK TO LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS THERE AN INTENT OF THE LRB TWO. AT TO CONTINUE TO OPPOSE WHAT THE FARMWORKERS HAVE ALREADY VOTED ON. HAYLER BEING HIS INTENDED TO FOLLOW WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID WHICH IS THAT- THAT THE DECISION OF THE FIST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL- I THAT THE BALLOTS WERE TO BE COUNTED AND THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION NOT HELD THAT THAT IS WHAT THE PORT THE PARTS OF SPOKEN AND OF COURSE THE ELLERBEE'S INTENTION IS TO FOLLOW. I FOLLOW THE COURT'S RULING SAID THE COURT'S RULING SAID THAT THE FARMWORKERS ABOUT TO BE UPHELD SO THE A. R. L. I. L. R. B. IS GOING TO HOLD THAT VOTE WE ARE FOLLOWING WHAT THE COURT'S RULING YES YES. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE COURT SAID COUNT THE BALLOTS YOU COUNTED THE BALLOTS THE OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTED THE U. F. W. TO NOT HAVING ANY AND- I THINK NUMBER ONE BECAUSE- WERE YOU AWARE THAT THESE FARMERS WOULD TAKE A PAY CUT. IF THEY JOIN THE F. W. I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE I'M I'M NOT AWARE OKAY. SO IS IT THE ELLERBEE'S INTENTION- TO UPHOLD WHAT THE FIFTH FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. AND S. RULED THAT THE VOTE WOULD STAND AND THEY COULD DECERTIFY THE UNION. YES AND THE UNION HAS BEEN DECERTIFIED SO I MEAN ARB WILL APPLE THE RULING OF THE COURSE AND WE WILL WE'RE WE WILL FOLLOW AT THE COURTS RULING. OKAY AN. I'M SORRY- IS ANY NEW I THINK I ASKED YOU THIS BUT JUST TO VERIFY- JUST TO CONFIRM THERE IS ARE THERE ANY RESOURCES BEING SPENT NOW TAXPAYER RESOURCES WHERE HE SPENT TEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH COULD HAVE GONE. I MEAN JUST TO. BE FAIR VOTE IT COULD HAVE GOT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOUSES WE GET ABOUT FOR FARMWORKERS AND GIFTED IT TO HIM FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS- BUT AS- IS THERE ANY. RESOURCES NOW BEING SPENT ON. DECERTIFYING OR THROWING OUT THE VOTE OF THESE FARMWORKERS. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. COULD YOU CHECK FOR ME AND LET ME KNOW. CERTAINLY BUT I CAN PRETTY I CAN SAY NO THERE ARE I B. CURRENTLY BEING SPENT ON THAT ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU. M. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET THE EXACT DATE YOU STARTED- OVER FIVE AND A HALF YEARS. SO DURING THAT FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF YOUR TENURE HAVE YOU PUT ANYTHING IN PLACE LIKE IT SO P. OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. SO THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER GROUP OF FARM WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING HARD TO PRODUCE THE FOOD THAT WE EAT. WELL WE LOOK AT CASE SAYS ARE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH CASE INDIVIDUALLY THAT COMES BEFORE US IN AND OF COURSE THE GENERAL COUNSEL PROGRAM. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING- THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL FILE WITH US AND SO CERTAINLY WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT EACH CASE VERY CAREFULLY. AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- THE FACT WHICH- WOULD SUBSTANTIATE A VIOLATION OF THE LAW- AND SO I NEED THAT THAT IS MY EXPECTATIONS ARE REPEATERS I PUT IN PLACE ALL ARE. YOU INSURE THAT THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT IS NOT HELD AND THAT THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO PERCEIVE AND UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHASE THAT IS BECAUSE- WE HAVE- FOUND VIOLATIONS BASED ON THE FACTS AND WITH A LOT. WITH A LOT OF SENSE. SO ARE YOU CURRENT PROCESS THE AUGUSTINE- GARCIA CASE. NO YOU ARE NOT NOT CASE THAT AND- ARGERSINGER C. IS A UNION WORKER THAT FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE US W. FOR SENDING THE FARMING ORGANIZATION A LETTER THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO BOYCOTT YOU. THE YEAH AND I KNOW THE FARMER DIDN'T WANT TO PROSECUTE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ARE PROSECUTING THE CASE. SO YOU'RE NOT. WE HAVE NOT FILED A COMPLAINT IN THAT MATTER IN OR NOT- PROSECUTING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE NOT KIDS NOW. OKAY OKAY- I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO YOU KNOW WHETHER RESOURCES ARE BEEN MEANS BEING SPENT ON THAT- FOR THAT AUGUSTINE GARCIA CASE- I BELIEVE. I I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT I'M NOT SURE BUT- I HAVE TO SEE YEAH BUT BUT I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I MEAN CERTAINLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BEING PROSECUTOR. OKAY I'M I GUESS ONE FINAL QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- MAYBE I GUESS- WHAT'S THE END GOAL LIKE. D. DOES DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION OF WHAT EHLERS IN GOAL IS WITH THESE. FOUR THOUSAND PLUS FARMWORKERS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT. DIDN'T WORK SO HARD I MEAN EIGHT YEARS. I MEAN EIGHT YEARS TO CONTINUE TO. FIGHT EVERY SINGLE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT MEAN IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WAS LOCALLY ELLERBEE THE STATE L. R. L. R. B. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. AND THE D. I. R. E. DATE THEY WORK SO HARD TO GET THEIR VOICES HEARD. WHAT'S THE END GOAL AND NOT JUST IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR OR THIS YEAR ACTUALLY NOT WITH THIS PARTICULAR FARMER BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OF FARMWORKERS. THAT WANT TO FOLLOW THE SUCCESS THAT THE BEES FARMWORKERS HAD AND THERE'S A COUPLE THOUSAND OF- SO. ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH I MEAN IF THEY GET THE SIGNATURES ON YOUR IN CHARGE NOW BASICALLY AS THE LEGAL COUNSEL SO WELL THAT LET ME JUST. SAY SHE'S NOT A BOARD MEMBER- YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A DISTINCTION TO BE MADE A FAIRNESS HI. YOUR QUESTIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT AND LIVE THROUGH THIS PERIOD AS WELL. I WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A STAGE JUST TO THE PUBLIC NINE SHE IS COUNCIL TO THE A. L. R. B. THE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF I DON'T KNOW INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBER INTENT I DON'T EVEN GO THAT FAR BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT JUST WANTED TO CADA. INTERJECT THAT A LITTLE BIT- BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THE INDIVIDUAL BEFORE US CAN ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS- BUT GO AHEAD TO MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR PER OF GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU MADAM PRETENDING AND MISS MAKE EVERY PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I'VE STEPPED OVER. THE LINE THAT YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR- THIS IS A VERY VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I WORKED WITH THESE FARMWORKERS DIRECTLY FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN EASY PLACE TO TAKE IT BACK BECAUSE- OF LEGISLATION AND PEOPLE WERE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR FARMWORKERS. AND THEY WERE BASICALLY KICKED IN THE TEETH THE ENTIRE TIME AND I JUST APPLAUD THEIR COURAGE- FORESEEN IT THROUGH AND IF YOU EVER MET SIMPLY A LOPEZ ALL FOUR FEET FOREVER I'M SURE AB I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TALL SHE IS BUT SHE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER THAN I AM- SHE HAD A PASSION TO- YOU KNOW AND SO DID ALL THE FARMWORKERS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. SO I GUESS MIGHT MIGHT ASKING ALL THOSE. QUESTIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE'S SOME TYPE OF. SOME TYPE OF PROCESS. GO THROUGH THIS HORRIFIC EVENT THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS AND TWO COURT DECISIONS. JUST TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THEIR VOTE COUNTED OKAY AND I DID JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON IT WHAT ARE PROJECTS THAT IS THAT I AM THE LABOR AGRICULTURALLY RELATIONS BOARD AND SO I DO OVERSEE THE INVESTIGATION. AND PROSECUTION OF THE CHARGES AND THAT BUT THE BOARD ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE CASES. AT THE WHITE I DIRECT MY STAFF TO DO IT IS IF THERE IS A CHARGE FILED THAT WE INVESTIGATED IN A NEUTRAL FASHION. VERY THOROUGHLY AND COMPETENTLY TO AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A VIOLATION OF OUR LAW HAS OCCURRED AND CHAU REALLY THAT'S THAT'S THE PART THEY MIGHT PROGRAM HANDLES IS. THE CITING WHETHER OR NOT TO PROSECUTE A CASE- IF WE'RE AND CRIMINAL LAW CONTEXT IF YOU LIKE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY I THINK RIGHT AND SO WE'VE IT BE DO YOU ONLY MAKE DECISIONS TO PURSUE AND PROSECUTE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE VIOLATIONS. WHEN THE FACTS AND THE LAW SUPPORT IT AND THAT IS WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING HAPPENS DURING MY TENURE AT THE LRB. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU I DO AND- I GUESS LIKE I SAID THAT THE CONTRACT THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT AND- A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN THAT CASE THEY DID NOT SEEM RIGHT FOR GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE THE WAY THEY DID- IT APPEARED. IT APPEARED AND IN SOME CASES PROVE AND THAT THERE WAS- HI NOT COLLUDING BUT WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE U. F. W. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THESE EMPLOYEES- RETAIN THEIR UNION STATUS EVEN THOUGH THE EMPLOYEES OVERWHELMINGLY I THINK SIX TO ONE VOTED- NOT TO RETAIN IT. AND I GUESS MOVING FORWARD WHILE YOU'RE AT YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL AND IN YOUR CHARGE TO INVESTIGATE THESE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FARMWORKERS GET A FAIR SHAKE AND IF THEY ARE WANTING TO- DECERTIFY OR JOINT I MEAN IT SHOULD BE THEIR CHOICE BUT IF THEY WANT TO DECERTIFY OR JOIN THE UNION- THEY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO. AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE MOVING FORWARD. THAT ALLOWS THESE FARMWORKERS TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS. AND NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH LIKE I SAID THAT TO SIGNATURE GATHERINGS THE ELECTION THAT WAS OVERSEEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE L. R. B. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIALIZATION. AND AFTER ALL OF THAT STILL HAVE THEIR BALLOTS LOCKED AT. I'M INDIAN THE APPEARANCE OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT IS THE INVESTIGATION OF THE AUGUSTINE CASE. WHERE THERE IS A POTENTIAL TO HAVE THAT VOTE AND THROWN OUT AND THAT WOULD BE A VERY SAD SAD EVENT TO PLEASE FARMWORKERS TO HAVE TO START ALL OVER AFTER EIGHT YEARS AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE. DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THANKS OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE OF SENATOR COME LONGER DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND THANK YOU MISS MONTGOMERY I HAVE FOR YOUR SERVICE AND I DO LIKE YOUR EYEWEAR. THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- THAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT. CANNABIS AS THE EMERGING INDUSTRY. THAT THE HAS PROVEN TO OFFER LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEN ALSO LOTS OF CHALLENGES AND THEN I GUESS AS IT RELATES TO THE A. L. R. B. CHALLENGES WITH THE INDUSTRY AND ITS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WORKPLACE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS AND WANTED TO KNOW WITH WHAT FEEDBACK HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING- FROM THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. ABOUT A L. ARBY'S OUT REACH EFFORTS. AND DOES FEDERAL. PREEMPTION IMPACT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO WITH THE INDUSTRY. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. I WE HAVE AT THE LRB WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONDUCTED SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY I THERE IS A- COUNSEL FOR- THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE IF HE'S WORKING WITH THE BOARD HE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF OUTREACH SPECIFICALLY EACH YEAR TO CANNABIS GROWERS AND OPERATORS ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT AS THIS IS A REALLY NEW AREA- AND OF COURSE SAY. A BURBANK A RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN DOING EXTENSIVE OUR REACH TO THE INDUSTRY- AND FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN POSITIVE O THAT- M. AND WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PRESENCE IN IN DIFFERENT ARE DIFFERENT PLANS INVOLVING CANNABIS OPERATORS THE END. I AND SO I DO BELIEVE THE PART B. DOCTORS BEEN POSITIVE AS FAR AS I HEARD. REGARDING FEDERAL PREEMPTION AYE THAT HAS NOT IMPACTED OUR WORK THAT I HAD SEEN I'M- OF COURSE CANNABIS IS LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THEREFORE WHEN THE ALR BEAT RECEIVES AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE. WORK INVOLVING A CANNABIS OPERATION WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF THESE WE INVESTIGATED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CASE AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A VIOLATION IN THE SAME FASHION. AND SO WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF THOSE AND- YEAH AND THE FEDERAL TRANSHUMANISTS. THANK YOU ARE YOU MAY HAVE SAID IT AND I HAD A BRAIN FART DID YOU TALK ABOUT UNFAIR PRACTICES OR DID YOU TALK ABOUT ILLEGAL OPERATORS- I WAS SPEAKING OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE YEAH. HE DOESN'T REALLY GET INTO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OPERATORS ARE ILLEGAL OR NOT OKAY I WAS PROBABLY LOOKING AT THAT IN MY NOTES WHILE YOU WERE ANSWERING IN MY BRAIN CROSSED WIRES. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION ON THE ISSUE. MY PLEASURE SENATOR THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER MEADOW VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU AMANDA NARAL PRO TEM AND- THANK YOU A MISS MONTGOMERY FOR YOUR SERVICE OFTEN. NUMBER OF YEARS LOTS OF ISSUES AND I'M JUST BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THEM BECAUSE MY DISTRICT HAVE COASTAL EROSION ISSUES BUT NOT. NECESSARILY ANY OF THE BIG LABOR- BATTLES GOING ON AT THE MOMENT WE NEVER KNOW BUT I WAS NOTING IN THE AND I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS GETTING HERE A LITTLE LATE BUT I NOTICED IN YOUR ON. YOUR GOALS FOR ONE OF THE THREE GOALS THAT YOU MENTIONED FOR YOUR SECOND TERM ARE IS TO FURTHER INCREASE FARMWORKERS KNOWLEDGE AND UTILIZATION OF THE L. R. B. AND TO THAT END THERE WAS A COMMENT REGARDING THE- CONFUSION THAT MIGHT EXIST ARE BETWEEN THE STATE AND- ENTITIES THAT ARE THERE TO HELP. FARMWORKERS AND THERE'S A CONFUSION ON WHERE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. INSTEAD OF THE A LARGE E. L. R. B. WITH RESPECT TO OVERTIME PAY IN PARTICULAR SO- UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO HOPEFULLY. PROVIDE THE KIND OF EDUCATION RESOURCE SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WHEN THEY DO HAVE A COMPLAINT. ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S IN THE WORKS AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON A TO FURTHER WHAT ARE YOUR OBJECTIVES SIDE TO MEET YOUR GOAL. YEAH THANK YOU CENTER HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT. SO WE ACTUALLY THE ELLERBEE IS WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVELY AND CLOSELY WITH- WITH OUR SISTER. DASHA RELATIONS AND OTHER AND LABOR FOR STOPPING AGENCY AND- IMPLEMENT ELEMENTS PART MEANT. FOR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND OTHER PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE CAN COLLABORATE ON ON PROVIDING OUTREACH TO THE FARMWORKER COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT- ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND WE'VE GREATLY INCREASED THE OUTRAGE THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE'VE ALSO- MODIFIED OUR OUT REACH DURING THE PANDEMIC TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO STILL REACH WORKERS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND IN PART ABOUT OUR REGION IS PROVIDING A RESOURCE FOR FARMWORKERS CHU- CONTACT US. WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR ISSUES THEY HAVE ABOUT WORKPLACE ISSUES ARE RIGHT- AND THEY ARE BE HAS AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THAT WE HAVE OPEN DOT. FOR FARMWORKERS TO CALL ON ANY WORKPLACE ISSUE WHICH THEY NEED ASSISTANCE ON AND WE'VE TRAINED OUR STAFF HUGH- TO ANSWER THOSE CALLS AND- WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION AND REFERRALS AND RESOURCES FOR WORKERS THAT CALL YOU NEED HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A WARM. HAND OFF SO TO SPEAK WHEN OUT WHEN IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE LRB COUNTS DECEPTIVELY TRUST BECAUSE WE DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGE THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN NOT KNOWING WHO TO CALL WHERETO GO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- THE DO YOU ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS HAVE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS REALLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP TRACK. AT AND SERVE WITHOUT. I WHY DID THIS THIS HOTLINE IS EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THAT WE PUT ON OUR OUTREACH MATERIALS AND WORK WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITIES SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RESOURCE IF YOU CALL IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. AND- AND SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'VE DONE IN ADDITION TO JUST REALLY TRYING TO YOU COLLABORATE WORKS CLOSELY WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS NONPROFIT. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE- CLOSE CONNECTION IN CONTACT WITH THE FARMWORKERS IN THESE DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE STATE AND SO. I THANK BERSTEN BASSAM TURNS OUT THAT THE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS THE TYPE OF WORK THEY DO THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE WORKERS IT'S REALLY HARD FOR OUR TINY LITTLE BOARD. TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE YOU CAN'T SO WE NEED TO LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND SO REALLY THAT IS THE EFFORT THAT IS UNDERWAY ISSUE INCREASE THAT. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF US BY WORKING TOGETHER WORK LAB WE ON OUR REACH AND PROVIDING A CENTRALIZED RESOURCE FOR PEOPLE TO CALL. AND GET ASSISTANCE. WITH THE- OF AN OMBUDSMAN WHICH- IS SED IN IN MANY OF THE AGENCIES AND CERTAINLY PRIVATE PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE- THERE ARE MANY CONSUMERS SHALL WE CALL THEM. STAKEHOLDERS TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. OF THEM THAT PERSON USUALLY ARE HAVE. IT PROVIDES A DIRECT CONTACT ALMOST LIKE THE TRAFFIC COP WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO GET THE SERVICE WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT. OF YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD WORK OR- IF THE AGENCY SO DIVERSE THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND. AN OFFICE OF OMBUDSMAN- OR WOULD THAT BE JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE BUREAUCRACY PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW BUT- IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED VERY WELL- WHEN WE HAD MANY ISSUES WITH. THE- NURSING HOME. AGENCIES AND PEOPLE FINDING THE RIGHT PATH TO THAT SO. FAR JUST JUST A THOUGHT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA AND IN FACT THAT THAT IS A WALL THAT DATE- WELL IN TERMS OF JUST A PROVIDING. INFORMATION RESOURCES THAT IT'S A ROLE THAT I THINK SOME OF OUR STAFF HAVE. STILL I DON'T KNOW IF I CLICK ON BUTTON BUT WERE JUST- SOMEBODY TO RECEIVE. ALL AND- AND ASSIST PEOPLE IN GETTING WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE. BEEN WORKING TO. ACHIEVE THAT AND- THAT'S BEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- SINCE WE- SINCE WE'VE OPENED UP THIS EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER A LITTLE MORE BROADLY- TO FARMWORKERS. BUT I THINK CERTAINLY THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER MODELS- IDEAS THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED TO MAKE SURE THAT FARMWORKERS CAN. AND GET THE HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY CONTACT SOMEBODY. AND THEY DON'T WORK OUT. I LEFT QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THAT GOAL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR AGENCY HAVING SERVED AS- LONG AS YOU HAVE TO CERTAINLY BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON. BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY- LAST QUESTION- THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS A FIREWALL IF YOU WILL BETWEEN YOUR DECISIONS SANDALS OF THE BOARD. SINCE THOSE ARE THE TWO DISTINCT DIVISIONS WITH HANNAH- LRB AND- YOU SOMETIMES INSTITUTIONAL BUYER FOR THE DRIVES ONE. HI IN A DIRECTION- SO THE QUESTION IS DO YOU HAVE A FIREWALL BETWEEN THE BOARD FUNCTIONS ON BOTH THAT YOUR OFFICE- CONDUCT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STAFF THAT YOU BOTH ARE USING AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AN INTEGRATION OF STAFF. AND I MIGHT THAT NOT BE YOU MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT BUT THAT'S HOW IN READING THE BACKGROUND IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME SHARED- SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES. I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT SENATOR THANK YOU- THERE IS A VERY CLEAR AND DISTINCT FIREWALL BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL IN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD AND WE DON'T IN FACT- JOINTLY SUPERVISED STAFF. OTHER THAN. THAT THE BOARD CHAIR AND I JOINTLY SUPERVISED OUR CHIEF. EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION THAT'S ART ART ARE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIVISION CHIEF. PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR THE ENTIRE L. R. B. SO WE JOINTLY SUPERVISED THE pOTHER THAN THAT NONE OF THE STOCK IS JOINTLY SUPERVISED IN THEIR- YOU KNOW IN THEIR DUTIES AND- THE BOARD THE BOARD OVERSEES CERTAIN FUNCTIONS LIKE ELECTIONS I THINK WHICH IS A SMALL EXCEPTION BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER I SUPERVISE. THE GENERAL GENERAL COUNSEL PROGRAM AND BOARD CHAIR SUPERVISED SINCE THE BOARD STAFF. AND WE DO KEEP THOSE FUNCTIONS SEPARATE AND THEY HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE A FIREWALL AND SEPARATED BECAUSE- WE ARE BRINGING CASE SAYS IN GENERAL HEALTH PROGRAM IS BRINGING CASES BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WHO ISSUED THE DECISION THAT THE BOARD THEN NEEDS TO. REVIEW HERE WHEN IT'S APPEAL TO THEM AND MAKE A DECISION SO THEY ARE LIKE THE- APPEALS COURT ESSENTIALLY FOR ARCHIE. AND SO FOR THAT PROCESS ARE TO RUN PROPERLY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE DO NOT- SHARE ANY INFORMATION AND WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY AND WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THAT. THAT THAT CONFIDENTIALITY IS CLOSELY STATE PARTY. THANK YOU ARE. REPLIED TAKING ON THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY LAST QUESTION BUT IT RAISED BY ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED REGARDING THE TIMELINE. FROM THE TIME THAT YOU RECEIVE A COMPLAINT AND TAKE IT OUT THROUGH THE PROCESS- YEAH IS THERE A TIMELINE THAT YOU MUST MEET OR THAT DISCRETIONARY. FOUND OUT IF THERE IS A LONGER DELAY- WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LEAST AN EMERGING COMPLAINT. ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR- YOUR EFFORT TO YOU KNOW RAIN THAT IN. IN A MORE. TIMELY DECISION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO WE DON'T HAVE A- ABSOLUTE. LIKE DEADLINE OR THERE'S NOT A LIKE A LIMITATIONS PERIOD THAT TO FILE A COMPLAINT BY A TRUCK FROM THE TIME WE GET AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE BY WE DO YOU ENDEAVOR TO INVESTIGATE CASES ALLIES HOUSE THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT THAT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE AND CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY OF MINE ARE GOING FORWARD. IS JUNE. MAKE SURE WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE. SO THAT OUR STAFF HAVE THE TOOLS. THEY NEED AND THAT YOUR TRAINING RESOURCES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO. YOU PURSUE THE INVESTIGATION- EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND- AND I AM WORKING HARD TO ELIMINATE ANY UNNECESSARY DELAYS THROUGH OUR PROCESS SO THERE ARE NECESSARY DELAYS IN CASES SOMETIMES THAT ARE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THAT THE AGRICULTURE WORKFORCES MIGRATORY- THE WORK IS SEASONAL THAT DOES PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN IN BEING ABLE TO LOCATE CERTAIN WITNESSES AN pINFORMATION WE MAY NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE IT THE TERMINATION AND AN INVESTIGATION. AND SO SOMETIMES THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT DELAY A CASE AND SO THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF OUR CONTROL BUT BUT FOR THOSE WITHIN OUR CONTROL I AM VERY COMMITTED. TO ENSURING THAT THAT WE- BOB DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO MOVE THESE CASES FORWARD AS AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN GET A SWIFT RESOLUTION TO THESE MATTERS THAT'S IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES I WAS VERY INVOLVED WITH THE- THE FARMWORKERS IN HER DISTRICT I THINK THE DELAY IN A DECISION BY YOUR- PARTICULAR- DIVISION. JEFF SOMETIMES THAT THERE EVEN A FIREWALL. THE THREE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL BIAS IN DOUBT ABOUT BEING THE FINAL DECISION COULD BE INFLUENCED BY THAT. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS TO THAT. HI I THINK YOUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY- HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE PRODUCING OUR FOOD IN THE VALLEY. AND BEYOND AND I THINK THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF THE CONFIDENCE. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HEAR COMMENTS THAT THEIR SON ATTEMPT TO DO A WORK AROUND WITH THE DECISION ON THE ON. THE CEDAR POINT CASE WHERE. WORKERS ON YOU KNOW A UNION ORGANIZER SINGLE ON PEOPLE'S PROPERTY AND YOU KNOW FIVE FEET FIGMENT JURORS ARE TO UNIONIZE AND ON THAT WAS RULED IN FAVOR OF THE OF THE- EMPLOYERS LET'S SAY BUT STILL THEY'RE STILL CONFIDENT PUSH A TO DO WITH. IN DEPTH TROUBLING WHEN IT HIT THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND THERE HAS TO BE SOME BIAS GOING ON THERE AND I THINK YOU'RE IN THE POSITION THAT YOU CAN BE PROBABLY THE GATEKEEPER TO MAKE SURE THAT TO BUILD OF LESSER DEGREE OF POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS NOT A BRAND OF R. A. L. OR BE. WITHOUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE AND A LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING BACK FROM YOU ON MEETING THAT GOT BOTH GOALS AND THE OBJECTIVES YOU SET FORTH TO DO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. I YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- WILL LAST I AM A SEEMINGLY HAVE THREE VERY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS- I. MAINLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS I SIT AND LISTEN AND I GET TO PICK UP ON WHERE PEOPLE LEFT OFF- THE TO FOLLOW ALONG MEADOW VICE CHAIRS- COMMENTS- IN THE BEGINNING OF HER QUESTIONS CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOU. ARE FROM A FARMER FOR WORKERS PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF BRINGING A COMPLAINT TO AYLER B. VERSES DIR THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IF YOU CAN. OUR RESPOND TO THAT. YES I'D BE HAPPY TO THINK HERE AT CENTER. REALLY WHAT WHAT THE ALARM HE DOES IS- IS IT IS I WOULD SAY. WATER IT IN IN SOME WAYS THAN- THEN WHAT ANY OTHER SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT WOULD YOUR WHAT WE WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION OVER IN OTHER WORDS THAT AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF OUR FARMWORKERS. HERE COME TOGETHER AND RAISE ISSUES ABOUT ANY WORKING CONDITIONS- AND BE PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION FOR DOING THAT AND SO. IF THEY DON'T IF THERE IS NOT YOU SEE WHERE THEY COME TOGETHER THEY RAISED ISSUE AND- AND SOMETHING HAPPENED AS A RESULT. THEN IT IT COULD BE ANY IT COULD BE ANY KIND OF TOPIC LIKE IF YOU CAN BE THANK THEY WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT GETTING OVERTIME ARE THEY WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT. DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT OR NOT HAVING RESTAURANTS AND OF COURSE THOSE ARE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THAT EITHER DEPARTMENT US RELATIONS WERE DEPARTING FROM PERMANENT HOUSING COULD HANDLE AS WELL BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE L. R. B. IS LOOKING AT WHETHER- YOUR WET. WHETHER THEY WERE RETALIATED AGAINST FOR THOSE ACTIONS. AND THEN OUR REMEDIES ARE ARE UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT. THAN THAN WHAT ANY OF THOSE OTHER AGENCIES TO GET OF COURSE ALL ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TO GET. UNPAID WAGES ARE BACK WE JUST LOST WAGES OF SOMEBODY SAY FIRED UNLAWFULLY RATE THAT WE CAN ALL GET THOSE BUT THE L. R. B. HAS THAT AUTHORITY TO GO INTO WORK AND GET. OUR QUICK REMEDIES IF AN INJUNCTION IF NEEDED AND WE HAVE A CERTAIN PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WE ALSO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REMEDIES- OR OR AT. IMPARTING INFORMATION TO WORKERS AFTER A BOARD ORDER OR RENT- SETTLEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE WORKERS GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VIOLATION OF WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. DEAD I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS HOUSE SO I WOULD SAY- CERTAINLY THEIR TIME FOR READ MORE READ. BAY JOINTLY INVESTIGATED CASE BY I. THE OTHER DAMAGE I THINK APPOINTED L. R. V. FOR FARMWORKERS IS THAT. WE ONLY HANDLE FARMWORKER ISSUES AND FARMWORKER CASES- WE ARE NOT PULLED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO HANDLING ALL THE INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE AND WE ALSO OUR STAFF IS WELL TRAINED HAS THE EXPERTISE. TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FARMWORKER ISSUES NO THE CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING- ADDRESS COMMUNICATION BARRIERS AND OTHER BARRIERS ARE THAT THEY HAVE. AND THEY ALSO ARE BASED IN AGRICULTURAL REGIONS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THEY HAVE THAT SPECIFIC EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE AND WE REALLY DO YOU GO THE EXTRA MILE AND- PUT IT AT A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR EFFORTS INTO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN FIND. WORKERS AND WITNESSES AND GET THE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED WHICH DOES TAKE A LOT OF WORK IN ANY GIEN CASE- AND BECAUSE WE'RE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON AGRICULTURE WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S ONE WHAT REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT. THEY ARE FARMWORKERS WOULD HAVE IN GOING TO THE L. R. B. AND IN ADDITION EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF THE LAW- THEY'RE STILL PROTECTED AND SO OF COURSE UPDATE IF WORKERS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THEY'RE BEING MISTREATED BY THEIR FOR MEN BECAUSE HE- HE'S JUSTRESPECTFUL TO THEM OR SOMETHING. THAT MAY NOT VIOLATING THE LAW- AND NO OTHER DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY WOULD HAVE ANY ANY ABILITY OR JURISDICTION TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT THE L. R. B. GOOD AND- THAT AND DETERMINE WHERE THEY RETALIATED AGAINST FOR GOING TO THEIR BOSTON. AND COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TREATED AND SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER ADVANTAGE I WOULD SAY OF. GOING ARB. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AND NOT I KNOW THAT. AT ONE POINT AROUND. TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. 40% ARE VACANT POSITIONS BUT THAT HAS SINCE CHANGED OBVIOUSLY WERE WELL DOWN THE ROAD- AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE NEW STAFF THINGS IMPROVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL STABILITY AND LEAD TO QUICKER AND BETTER OUTCOMES I JUST WANT YOU TO CONFIRM THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE I KNOW YOU COMMENTED ON IT. A TO SOME DEGREE I PREVIOUSLY BUT- ARE YOU FINDING THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND HAVE. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE A QUICKER REVIEW- OF THE PRACTICES- AND RESOLUTION QUICKER I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM YOU EVEN COMMENTED ON THAT. YEAH YES SENATOR THAT THAT IS CORRECT WE HAVE- AS YOU MENTIONED WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR VACANCY RATES SINCE I'VE BEEN AT THE LRB AND WE DO HAVE MORE ORGANIZATIONAL STABILITY AS A RESULT I AND I AND OUR STAFF HAS BEEN- YOUR BEEN AT THE LRB MUCH. LONGER ITS WALLS AND THEN WHEN I AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF WORK STREET STOP AND WE GET WHEN I FIRST CAME ONTO THE L. R. B. AND THAT THAT HAS. HELPED US TO- TO DO BETTER WORK AND WE HAVE WE HAVE IMPROVED- WE HAVE WE HAVE INCREASED OUR- INVESTIGATION TIMELINE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M CONTINUING TO WORK ON. THANK YOU- THE LAST QUESTION REALLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH. THE SITUATION WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN RIGHT NOW WITH CODE BUT ALSO FIRES. TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE HAS THERE BEEN ANY WORK STOPPAGES RELATED TO SMOKE- ARE UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE ARE- HARMFUL WILDFIRE SMOKE EITHER OF THOSE ISSUES. HAVE THERE BEEN WORK STOPPAGES. YES CENTER AYE AYE THERE HAVE BEEN WORK STOPPAGES RELATING TO ISSUES REGARDING PUBLIC SAFETY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT WILDFIRE SMOKE WALKING ON BUT BUT I DO KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WORK STOPPAGES RELATED TO ISSUES- OF COCOA CHICKEN OR ICE. WELL THANK YOU- I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS FIVE FROM A FIFTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO GET QUESTIONS ABOUT ACROSS INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE STATE HAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT AND- AND WORK WORKER SAFETY AND PROTECTION- LET ME- LET ME JUST. SAY I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH BETWEEN THIS TIME- YOUR TIME BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT AND THE RE APPOINTMENT TO SEE SOME OF THE CHANGES IN TERMS OF- THE VACANCIES ARE EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH. ARM YOU KNOW CLARITY AND TO DEAL WITH THE CONFUSION BETWEEN ISSUES AROUND D. I. R. I. DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND- THE BOARD.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'M SORRY. AFTERNOON MADAM PRO TEM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN I WAS FIRST APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND TO SERVE AS THE W. C. A. B. C. CHAIR SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN I WAS GIVEN THAT DESIGNATION. I GOVERNOR BROWN I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY SEEKING CONFIRMATION OF A SECOND TERM ON THE BOARD FOLLOWING MY RE APPOINTMENT BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM LAST YEAR. I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY MY SPOUSE NIKKI SELASKY AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK HER FOR HER ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. I ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES WE'RE WATCHING THE HEARING REMOTELY TODAY. I SPENT ALMOST ALL OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE WORKING IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM I'VE BEEN A MANAGER IN SMALL LITIGATION SUPPORT BUSINESSES WORKING DIRECTLY WITH EMPLOYEES TRYING TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER ON THE JOB INJURIES. I'VE ALSO WORKED AS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING EMPLOYERS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES IN WORKERS COMPENSATION MATTERS I'VE BEEN A WORKERS COMPENSATION TRIAL JUDGE I'VE WORKED IN THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF BOTH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AND I NOW SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE W. C. A. B. THE W. C. A. B. SERVES AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE FIRST LEVEL APPELLATE COURT FOR PARTY SEEKING TO CHALLENGE DECISIONS ISSUED BY WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES. WHAT AE DECISIONS CAN BE APPEALED TO THE CALIFORNIA COURTS OF APPEAL AND TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT WE ARE OFTEN THE ONLY APPELLATE BODY TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THE CASE. WHICH MAKES US A COURT OF LAST RESORT IN THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CASES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR DECISIONS ARE ISSUED BY PANELS OF THREE COMMISSIONERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EACH CASE. THESE DECISIONS ARE ONLY BINDING IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IN WHICH THEY ARE ISSUED AND HAVE NO PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT BEYOND THAT. BUT EVEN THESE DECISIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO PARTIES WITH CASES WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUES DECISIONS AS A FORMER BOARD ON ISSUES OF WIDESPREAD IMPACT. THOSE DECISIONS ARE BINDING AND ALL WORKERS COMPENSATION CASES I MUST BE FOLLOWED BY THE TRIAL JUDGES AND OUR PANELS UNLESS AND UNTIL THEY ARE OVERTURNED OR ALTERED BY AN APPELLATE COURT OR THE SUPREME COURT. IN ALL OF THE CASES THAT COME BEFORE US WE STRIVE TO ISSUE DECISIONS THAT ARE CLEAR CONSISTENT WELL REASONED AND LEGALLY CORRECT. I HAVE WORKED WITH MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF ATTORNEYS TOWARD THIS GOAL FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE W. C. A. B. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FOCUS FOR ME GOING FORWARD. I APPRECIATED THE THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS POSED DURING THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS BOTH IN WRITING AND IN MY MEETINGS WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF MEMBERS. THEY PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO REVIEW AND REFLECT ON MY WORK OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. AND INSPIRED MY THOUGHTS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR ME THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE- OPENING COMMENTS I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR- SENATOR BATES AND LET HER GET IT STARTED. THANK YOU- METROTOWN AND THANK YOU- IF IT'LL LET ME SEE IF I MAY SAY THIS LITTLE. HELLO BLUESKY IT SKI BUT ALLOWING US I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO FIND I THINK YOU SAID. THAT THAT I THINK THE USE THAT RIGHT BUT I WASN'T LISTENING OF COURSE IF I SHOULD HAVE BUT ARE YOU COME TO A FIVE AND IT'S INTERESTING A LOT OF A LOT OF THUMBS UP IN A LOT OF HIGH FIVES AND A FEW OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE. BEEN PROVIDED- FOR BASED ON YOUR SERVICE TO DATE SO I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY ARE SAYS A WELL OF YOU AND- OF YOUR SERVICE TO DATE- SO- LET ME ASK YOU JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE'RE PART OF THE ORIGINAL INTERVIEWS YOU HAD WAS STAFF. ARE INTERESTING TO ME AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH ANY OF IT RELATED. APPEALS BEFORE THE BOARD OR ANY AB FIVE- INCREASE OR ANY OF THOSE COMING FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED. THAT THE BOARD COULD BE OVERWHELMED IF BOTH CALM AND MATH. AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE. STILL IN THE PANDEMIC AND WE'RE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING ADEQUATE STAFF. TO HANDLE OUR WORK YEAH CERTAINLY IN ANY AGENCY SO. IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT WITH US THAT WOULD BE ON QUESTION. ONE FOR ME AND I HAVE JUST ONE OTHERS. BOB IT WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR SERVICE TO DATE CERTAINLY HAVE. GOT YOU ON. AN A GRADE. MAYBE IN A MINUTE WITH SAM BUT- FROM MY READING IT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE A SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FIRST WITH RESPECT TO CALL COULD CLAIMS WE REALLY HAVE NOT SEEN. A CASES ON THE MERITS OF A CLAIM FILED BY A WORKER THAT THEY CONTRACTED COVERT AS A RESULT OF WORK ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE HAD SOME CASES CHALLENGING SOME OF THE PROCEDURES THAT WERE INSTITUTED TO KEEP CASES MOVING FORWARD DURING THE PAN. REGARDING REMOTE HEARINGS AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO GO FORWARD OR NOT- IN TERMS OF CASES ON THE MERITS OF COVED CLAIMS I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING THEM. YOU KNOW FIRST THERE ARE SOME PRESUMPTIONS IN PLACE AND THE POINT OF PRESUMPTIONS IS WILL BE TO REDUCE LITIGATION. AT LEAST AROUND THE THRESHOLD ISSUE OF AN INJURY ARISING OUT OF AN OCCURRING IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT. ALSO IT TAKES TIME FOR CASES TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR SYSTEM YOU KNOW THE CLAIM WAS FIRST MADE THE EMPLOYER HAS A NINETY DAY PERIOD TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ACCEPT OR DENY THE CLAIM. IF IT'S ACCEPTED THERE'S NO NEED FOR LITIGATION AT THAT POINT AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN COME INTO OUR LITIGATION SYSTEM UNTIL THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ONCE THE DISPUTE IS AYE DADDY DIED AND- WHAT THE- WORKERS COMPENSATION VERSION OF A COMPLAINT WHICH IS FILED AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICATA CLAIM. IS FILED THEN THERE STILL HAS TO BE A TRIAL PROCESS WE DON'T GET THE CASE UNTIL A DECISION ISSUED AND SOME PARTY IS AGGRIEVED BY IT SO I THINK JUST YOU KNOW GIVEN THE TIMING AND- SOME OF THE DELAYS THAT COME OF IT IS JUST AND GENDER AND THIS TIME WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE CASES. COME TO US. YET AB FIVE FROM. YOU KNOW. TWENTY TWO CHANGED RECOUP FIELD. THAT AND THERE'S OF COURSE ONGOING LITIGATION REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF PROP TWENTY TWO WHICH WE- BOB FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THANKFULLY ARE NOT PART OF. BLOOD AS A RESULT OF THAT I THINK PERHAPS THAT SLOWED SOME OF THOSE CASES DOWN AND AGAIN WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THEM WORK THEIR WAY UP TO US YET HAVE CONCERNING RIGHTS. WELL YES OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE GREAT UNKNOWN HOW MANY CASES ARE GOING TO COME OUT WHAT KIND OF ISSUES ARE THEY GOING TO- REYES HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM. YOU KNOW WE ARE AS PREPARED AS WE CAN BE WE'VE INCREASED OUR STAFFING OVER THE PAST. OF LESS THAN A YEAR WE'VE BROUGHT ON BOARD FIVE NEW STAFF ATTORNEYS WE HAVE A COUPLE POSITIONS COMING UP SO WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO BE READY SYSTEMICALLY FOR THOSE CASES WHEN THEY REACH US AND OF COURSE HOW WE ADDRESS THEM ON THE MERITS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON THE STATE OF THE LAW WHEN THEY GET TO US. GOOD I HAVE THAT'S REALLY ARGUE HERE THAT THERE IS. CERTAINLY I'D BE PREPARED TO ATTITUDE THAT'S GOING ON IN IN THE EVENT OF. A SECOND QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH OF THE PROCESS. AND HAVING PROBABLY ON THE FIRST STEP NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE AN AT. ISSUE I BELIEVE IF YOU GET A HUGE NUMBER COMING FORWARD IF THE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINER. REQUIREMENT IN THE FIRST STEP IN THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH. HAVING ENOUGH OF THOSE SO. I SHARE WITH ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE. Q. IN ME FOR A PART OF THE SYSTEM. WELL THE CERTIFICATION AND SELECTION PROCESS IS ACTUALLY OVERSEEN BY THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE W. C. A. B. BUT BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW AS A AS AN ADVOCATE AS A JUDGE AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED IN ADMINISTRATION THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WITH FINDING OUT OF QUALIFYING AND RETAINING DOCTORS TO SERVE IN THOSE ROLES AND I KNOW THE D. W. C. HAS QUITE A LOT OF EFFORT INTO EXAMINING HOW DO THAT- CHANGING FEE SCHEDULES INCREASING- SOME OF THE AMOUNTS THAT DOCTORS CAN BE PAID FOR VARIOUS PARTS OF THEIR SERVICES. I THINK I'VE ALSO DONE A GOOD JOB INCREASING OUR REACH TO DOCTORS TO TRY TO SOLICIT- THE INTEREST IN THAT PROGRAM SO HOPEFULLY THOSE EFFORTS BEAR FRUIT IF NOT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE STAKEHOLDERS COMING TOGETHER AND JUST TALKING ABOUT. ZERO TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER BOTTLENECKS AND LOGJAMS RESULT FROM NOT HAVING ENOUGH DOCTORS. YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF- MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS BUT I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE EXPANDED THROUGH LEGISLATION HERE ARE AT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THERE BEEN. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN M. D. BY BY DEFINITION OR BY BY BY LAW IT WILL CHIROPRACTORS CAN ACT AS Q. I MAYES OKAY THAT'S- ACTUALLY AN AREA OF SPECIALIZATION THAT PARTIES CAN REQUEST- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE SO BOB IT'S NOT LIMITED SPECIFICALLY TWO M. DIS WHICH I THINK DOES YOU KNOW HELP WITH BROADENING THE POOL OF PRACTITIONERS YOU CAN DRAW FROM. GOOD IDEA I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE WE NEED TO REACH OUR TO ANOTHER POOL OR EXPAND THE POOL SO THAT WE DON'T DELAY IN TERMS OF THE EXAMINATION WHEN WE HAVE OUR WORKERS WHO ARE INJURED AND AWAITING A DECISION ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU KNOW TO GET THE TREATMENTS THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN GET BACK. TO WORK OR JUST- YOU KNOW I'D THEIR DAILY LIVING ACTIVITIES AND SOME CASES ANYWAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR ANSWERS AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR I THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- SENATOR COME LONGER LET ME GO TO YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND- MISTER LUCKY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. I THINK IT WAS ON MONDAY FOR US TO HAVE A BRIEF CONVERSATION. WHEN YOU'RE COOPED UP THAT THE DAY'S KINDA WHO KNOWS WHAT DAY IT IS- I. JUST WANTED TO ASK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS WHEN WE- HAD OUR DISCUSSION AND YOU DID MENTION THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE STAFF ATTORNEYS I THINK YOU SAID FIVE. AND SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT JUST MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY- TO MANAGE THE CASE LOADS THAT YOU ALL- WE'RE FINDING YOURSELVES DEALING WITH THE S. FIVE NEW ATTORNEYS. JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU IF YOU ANTICIPATE ANY CASES. REGARDING WORKER MISS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN THE TNC INDUSTRY. GIVEN THE RECENT OVERTURNED OF PROP TWENTY TWO. AND YOU CAN BE AS SPECIFIC AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE TNC INDUSTRY FOR YOU CAN BE A LITTLE MORE GENERAL AND BROAD. BUT THE ISSUE IN GENERAL. WELL YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR US TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW ISSUES ARE GOING TO COME TO US IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR EVERY TIME I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO TEE UP I. MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF NICHOLS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AN INJURED WORKER. WHO HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BY THEIR EMPLOYER WHO'S BEEN DENIED WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS- BELIEVES THAT DATE YOU KNOW MEET WHATEVER THE STATUTORY DEFINITION. OILS DOWN TO AFTER YOU KNOW ALL OF THE DUST SETTLES. ON THE PROP TWENTY TWO AND EIGHTY FIVE- LITIGATION AND WE ARE WELL VERSED IN DOING THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS THIS ISN'T A NEW ISSUE THAT JUST CAME UP WITH THE YOU KNOW RISE OF THE SO CALLED GIG ECONOMY WE'VE HADTESTS IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME SO IT'S FOR US A MATTER OF TAKING WHATEVER THE NEW STATE OF THE LAW IS. AND APPLYING IT TO THE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS THAT COME BEFORE US. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT- I THINK I JOKINGLY. MENTIONED TAKE YOUR THAT I THOUGHT WORKERS COMPENSATION KIND OF ON ITS FACE SEEMS LIKE A RATHER DAHLE. ISSUE BUT THAT I APPLIED- ATTORNEYS AND INVESTIGATORS AND REGULATORS AND FOLKS LIKE YOURSELF WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY- BECAUSE- WORKER CLASSIFICATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HAS IS WORKER SAFETY AND PROTECTIONS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A DUE PROCESS THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION AND THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT ARE WORKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I JUST COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS COMMISSION AND LOOK FORWARD TO. VOTING I FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LONGER- SENATOR LAYERED EUROPE. ACTUALLY ARE I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE INFORMATION I GOT I THINK THIS IS A GREAT CANDIDATE I HAVE NO QUESTIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. THANK YOU PROBABLY QUESTION SENATOR KAMLAGER ABOUT WHAT'S BORING RATHER THAN. THE PERSON UP I FEEL CERTAIN THAT- CENTER LAYERED MY COMMENT ON THAT ACTUALLY- I HAVE ONE QUESTION I'M I'M COGNIZANT MAYBE- AND THAT WE HAVE ONE MORE COLLEAGUE A YET TO SPEAK I'LL GO AHEAD OF HER- BUT- IN TERMS OF- JUST A GENERAL QUESTION THAT KIND OF ALONG THE LINE THAT. SOMETHING YOU'VE HAD JUST ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION ON A COUPLE OF THINGS. YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOUR BACKGROUND. DO YOU THINK RECENT REFORM EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS HAVE STRUCK AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN COST TO EMPLOYERS. AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR INJURED WORKERS AYE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THINK OF THIS LATE AT NIGHT. ARE ALONG THE LINES OF EXCITEMENT MISS COM BLOGGER BUT OSCAR. BUT I WOULD LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. YES YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL TENSION I THINK WITHIN THE SYSTEM THE COSTS TO- CARRIERS IN TWO PLAYERS AND ALSO THERE'S A COST FACTOR TO INJURED WORKERS IN THE TIME TAKEN TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WHILE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE MAYBE NOT GETTING TREATMENT AND TO OR OF WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO BE APPROVED AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE NOT SHE'S SMARTER AND MUCH MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN I AM HAVE SPENT. YEARS PUZZLING OUT THE BEST WAYS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES I THINK- YOU KNOW THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OUT THERE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUILDING A BETTER MOUSETRAP A BETTER WAY TO ADDRESS THIS. I DO THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT EXPEDITES THE PROCESS ALSO HAS TO COME WITH IT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR HEARING OF THE CONCERNS RAISED ON BOTH SIDES. AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THINGS LIKE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW. TO INJECT OBJECTIVES OF MEDICAL DECISION MAKING IT INTO THE SYSTEM. BUT THAT CAN'T COME AT THE EXPENSE OF FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOU KNOW ANY INJURED WORKER AND WHAT THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS MIGHT BE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A HARD BALANCE TO STRIKE. WELL AGAIN I THINK GIVEN YOUR HISTORY ON THIS BOARD AS WELL AS- IT IN YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE I. I COULDN'T RESIST THE CHANCE TO ASK AND LET ME GIVE CREDIT TO STAFF I THINK THAT QUESTION CAME FROM SOME OF OUR INTERNAL RULES STAFF I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT- RECESSION QUESTION TO GET. FROM SOMEONE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE. THE LAST ONE I HAVE A SORT OF ALONG THOSE LINES. IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO SUGGEST CHANGES TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IF YOU FIND DEFICIENCIES OF LAW AND IF SO. HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THOSE SUGGESTIONS INTO HOME. WELL AS THE COURT YOU KNOW OUR ROLE IS TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT YOU THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. AND APPLY THEM IN INDIVIDUAL CASES AND INTERPRET THEM TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO THEN STEP OUT OF THAT ROLE AND SAY WELL. YOU KNOW WE THINK THE LAW SHOULD BE ACCESS I THINK. SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN IMPROVING THE SYSTEM COULD CERTAINLY SIT DOWN LOOK AT OUR DECISIONS AND IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE MAYBE YOU THINK WE'VE GONE. SIDEWAYS FROM WHAT YOUR INTENT WAS IN ANY PARTICULAR PART OF THE LABOR CODE. AND YOU KNOW TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT I WAS SIDE YEAH I WAS I WAS HOPING TO GLEAN FROM YOUR- THOUGHT PROCESSES YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY WELL VERSED IN IN IN- WHAT IS REQUIRED IF YOUR JOB. I DO APPRECIATE THAT THOUGH- AND- WITH THAT- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE ALREADY SPOKEN- WITH MY REGARDS TO THANKS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THE BOARD THAT YOU ARE LEADING. SO APPRECIATED- I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MA'AM FOR TIME I APOLOGIZE FOR STEPPING OUT MISSILE IN SKI I A LOT OF THE OTHER BOARD MAKE ARE THE OTHER ROLES MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- THE BALANCE THAT YOUBRING FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD. AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION A FOLLOW AT- THAT MY COLLEAGUE AT THAT COULD VICE CHAIR ASKED. SHE ASKED ABOUT KEY WHITNEY'S- AND THE INCREASING AS IT HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN AMY'S AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HELP. LIMIT SOME OF THE CASES THAT WOULD GO TO YOU. IF AMY SWEAR READILY AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO. ADDRESS AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT FACE OUR INJURED WORKERS SAY WHAT THAT HIS FELLOW ACTOR IN GREED MEDICAL THANK YOU. SO I GUESS FOR THE PURPOSES OF- PEOPLE WATCHING. AT CUNY'S ARE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND EACH SIDE WILL GET THEIR OWN QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINER- AND THEN THERE'S A DISPUTE IF THEY'RE DOING AGREES THAT THERE ARE ALSO AMY'S WHICH AGREED MEDICAL EXAMINERS WERE BOTH SIDES AGREE ON ONE PERSON AND THEN. TAKE THAT DECISION THAT THAT A MEDICAL EXAMINER AGREED MEDICAL EXAMINER- PUTS FORTH IN DIDN'T THAT HELPS ELIMINATE SOME OF THE CASES THAT MAY GO FORWARD. TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD. RIGHT- SO I NEED TAKE KERR ONE THING THE SAID. UNDER OUR CURRENCY EACH SIDE DOESN'T GET THEIR OWN CHU I MAY. EITHER SIDE IDENTIFIES A NEED. FOR ANOTHER- OPINION. FROM BEGINNER SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE TREATING DOCTOR THERE'S ACTUALLY A PANEL PROCESS WHERE A LIST OF THREE DOCTORS IS ISSUED BY THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. RT CAN IN NAME AND THEN BLAST STANDING SERVES AS THE TO AND ME OKAY. IN THE CASE ALL RIGHT OR THEY CAN AGREED TO ONE OF THE DOCTORS WHO IS ON THE LAST AGREED MEDICAL EVALUATORS- THE ARRANGEMENTS HERE SHE SAID ARE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THE PARTIES AGREED AT THE OUTSET THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE OPINIONS OF THIS DOCTOR. OUR BOARD HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY CASES JUST IN THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL INVOLVED AGREED MEDICAL EVALUATORS WE STARTED FORTY. CASES WHERE THERE ARE A AND THE USE OF THE PARTIES DISAGREE ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE DOCTOR'S OPINIONS OR MAYBE THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THEM SO IT'S NOT FOOLPROOF BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I THINK THE MORE ARE THE PARTIES CAN AGREE TO FOLLOW A PARTICULAR DOCTORS OPINIONS. BUT LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME INTO. OUR MITIGATION SYSTEM. OKAY THAT MUCH I'M SORRY I HAD THAT THAT MADE THE WRONG INFORMATION- I. E. AT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE PRESUMPTION UNDER CO THAT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THAT PERCEPTION WHEN IT CAME TO KIND OF IT. AND IN I ALSO LISTEN TO YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF THOSE CASES YET. AND IS. IN THIS MAY NOT IT MAY NOT BE IN YOUR PURVIEW AND IF IT'S NOT I'M I APOLOGIZE BUT I'M HOPING YOU DO HAVE THE ANSWER FOR IT. AND THAT PRESUMPTION IS THAT PRESUMPTION A NUMBER ONE STILL IN PLACE AND NUMBER TWO. DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE AND NUMBER THREE. IS IT GOING AGAINST THE EMPLOYERS- MODERATE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MODERATES THAT'S HANDLED BY THE WCI ARE BE WHICH IS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE RATING BUREAU THEY- YOU KNOW MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. ABOUT RATE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ON YOU KNOW THAT SIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE. RECENSIONS HAVE SHIFTED OVER TIME WE STARTED AS YOU MENTIONED WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THEN NOW THERE IS- SOMETHING CODIFIED IN THE LABOR CODE THAT YOU KNOW ALLOWS OR CREATES PRESUMPTIONS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO REVOLVE IS CORRECTED CELLS INVOLVES. THANK YOU VERY MATCH- WITH RESPECT TO AB FIVE AND WORKER I MISS CLASSIFICATION AND HAS A DIVVY CA BE ISSUED IN THE M. BACHER SIGNIFICANT PANEL DECISIONS I'M ASSUMING NOW BASED ON WHAT YOU CALL SENATOR BAY OUR SKIS ME MY COLLEAGUES. THE VICE HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THOSE CASES YET YES THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR REID WE HAVEN'T EVEN ISSUED PANEL DECISIONS LET ALONE DO YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT OR AND BOX. DO YOU BASED ON THEM I DON'T SEE SCUTTLED BUT BUT LIKE BASED ON WHAT'S COMING UP UNDERNEATH THE DO YOU- DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE THIS YEAR DO YOU THINK MAYBE MORE LIKE NEXT YEAR. YOU KNOW IT COULD BE THIS YEAR IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF CASES WHERE. THE EMPLOYER SIDE HAVE SAID THEY WANT TO WAIT ON MOVING FORWARD. UNTIL THE PROP TWENTY TWO. CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE IS WORKED OUT IF THAT CONTINUES TO BE. A TREND THAT- YOU KNOW TAKES HOLD IT'S GOING TO TAKE LONGER FOR THOSE CASES TO GET TO US BUT- YOU KNOW THERE THERE COULD BE A CASE WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM NOW. THAT PRESENTS THE ISSUES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ISSUE WHEN AND BONTA SO. IN MY CRYSTAL BALL IS A LITTLE CLARITY ON THE TIMING FOR THAT. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW AND- THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMITTEE THAT I'VE HAD THE HONOR TO SIT ON AND GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS ARE AT. I CAN TELL YOU FIFTY FIFTY AND THEN 50% THAT.
