GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SANTIAGO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANKS FOR THE TIME TAG OVER THESE CONTACTS TODAY MY NAME IS NATHAN VOCALLY AND I'M THAT GOVERNOR'S SENIOR ADVISER FOR TRIBAL NEGOTIATIONS PAST YEAR THAT I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER THE TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS. GAMING COMPACT FOR THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA. BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO THANK MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA CHAIR AS A SIMON FOR HIS TRIBE'S HARD WORK TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THIS CONTACT. I'LL BEGIN TODAY WITH A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACT IN PROCESS. AND THE REASON JUST APPROVALS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED. ALL OF THEM TURNED TO THE TERMS OF THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA COMPACT SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN PROPOSITION ONE A. APPROVED AMENDING THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. TO ALLOW TRIBES TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES BANKING IN PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES AND LOTTERY GAMES ON INDIAN LANDS. UNDER THE FEDERAL INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT OR A GROUND A TRIBE CAN OFFER THE SLOT MACHINES IN CLASS THREE GAMES IF THE TRIBE HAS NEGOTIATED A TRIBAL STATE CLASS THREE GAMING COMPACT. THEY WERE BROADLY LIMITS COMPACTS TO SUBJECTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF GAMING ACTIVITIES. PURSUANT TO PROP ONE EIGHTY AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THE GOVERNOR NEGOTIATES IN A TRIBE A TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT WITH THE TRIBE AND THEN PRESENT IT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR RATIFICATION COMPACT TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR FOR A FORTY FIVE DAY REVIEW. DURING THAT FORTY FIVE REVIEW THE SECRETARY CAN APPROVE THE COMPACT DISAPPROVE THE CONTACT OR NOT ACT ON IT IN WHICH CASE THE CONTACT IS DEEMED APPROVED. MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA IS CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A COMPACT SIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. SET TO EXPIRE IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA SIGNED A NEW TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT. I WAS RATIFIED BY THE LATE LEGISLATURE LAST AUGUST. MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIAS CONTACT ALONG WITH SANTA ROSA RANCHERIAS COMPACT THAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER. WAS ONE OF THREE CONTACTS DISAPPROVED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. INTERIOR ISSUED A LETTER AT THE TIME THAT IT EXPLAINED IN ITS VIEW WHY THE COMPACT EXCEEDED THE SCOPE OF TOPICS AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY. AS A RESULT OF THE SECRETARY'S DISAPPROVAL THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF PRIOR CALIFORNIA COMPACTS. NINTH CIRCUIT CASE LAW AND CONTACTS AND OTHER STATES. INFORMED BY THIS WORK THE STATE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA UPDATED ITS TWENTY COMPACT. MAJORITY OF THE TERMS IN MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIAS UPDATED CONTACT REMAIN THE SAME AS THAT PREVIOUSLY RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT REFLECTS EXISTING TRAVEL POLICIES AND THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT NATURE OF THE TRIBAL STATE RELATIONSHIPS. THE COMPACT IRMA'S FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND INCLUDES FORCE MEASURE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS REDUCED OPERATIONS OR CLOSURES FROM PANDEMICS. WILD FIRES AND OTHER EVENTS OUTSIDE OF THE TRIBES CONTROL. IT ALSO GRANTS THE TRIBE. THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR NEGOTIATE AN AMENDMENT IF THAT IF TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA LOSE THEIR EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO OPERATE GAMING DEVICES IN THIS UPDATED CONTACT WAS REVISED TO MORE CLOSELY TRACKED DEFINITIONS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR. THE SCOPE OF THE DEFINITION WAS NARROWED CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECENT CONTACTS THE FOCUS ON FACILITIES WITH THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF SERVING THE GAMING OPERATION. MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA COMMITTED TO OUR PRO RATA SHARE OF PAYMENTS TO THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND OR STF AS IT'S CALLED. WHICH IS USED TO REIMBURSE THE STATE ITS REGULAR AND OTHER DIRECT COSTS A TRIBAL GAMING. IN RECOGNITION OF PRIOR PREPAYMENT OF FEES FOR UNUSED GAME LICENSES MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIAS CONTACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A CREDIT AGAINST ITS STAFF STF OBLIGATION. THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA THROUGH ITS TWIN PINE CASINO IN LAKE COUNTY CURRENTLY OPERATES UNDER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY GAMING DEVICES. IF IT CONTINUES TO OPERATE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AS A LIMITED GAMING TRIBE IT'LL-REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR ONE POINT ONE MILLION ANNUALLY FROM THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND R. R. S. T. F. R. S. T. F. AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE. FOR THAT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DISBURSEMENT TEACH LIMITED AND NON GAMING TRIBES. IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE TRAVEL NAY FUND. THE TRIBE COULD EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS TO UP TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED GAMING DEVICES ACROSS TO FACILITIES. WITH NO ADDITIONAL ARE STF PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPACT INCLUDE STANDARDS FOR GAMING REGULATION LICENSING AND GAMING DEVICE TESTING AND INSPECTIONS. IT ALSO ADDRESSES HEALTH SAFETY AND LABOR PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES AND VISITORS. IN THIS APPROVING THE PRIOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE CONTACTS THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THE COMPACTS BROADLY REGULATED TOBACCO SALES. CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE STATE AND THE TRIBES. TWENTY ONE CONTACTS THIS UPDATED CONTACT THOSE THAT FOCUSES ON PROHIBITING TOBACCO SALES TO MINORS AT THE GAMING FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW. WHICH REQUIRES A PURCHASER TO BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD JUST AS FOR STATE LAW. ADDITIONALLY THE TRIBES AGREED TO CONTINUE ITS PRACTICE OF RECOGNIZING STATE SPOUSAL AND CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS. AGAINST NON TRIBAL MEMBER CASINO EMPLOYEES BUT THE UPDATED PROVISION HIGHLIGHTSTHE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AS A LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. THE CONTACTING CORPORATIONS TRAVELODGE RESTING PATRON DISPUTES TORTS AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS. THE TRIBE COMMITS TO ENSURING MINIMUM WAGE RATES AT LEAST AS STRINGENT AS CALIFORNIA'S AND TO MAINTAINING A TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE. IT ALSO AGREED TO REVISE LANGUAGE REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE TRIBE IN THE STATE. THAT BY AGREEING T MAINTAIN THE ORDINANCE THE TRIBE IS ALSO AGREEING TO COMPLY WITH IT. THE TLR OVER TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE TAKES EFFECT WHEN A TRIBE EMPLOYS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR MORE PEOPLE AT ITS GAMING RELATED FACILITIES. NOT COUNTING TRIBAL MEMBERS. THE TLR- FUNCTIONS AS THE MECHANISM FOR A BILATERAL CONTRACT BETWEEN THE TRIBE AND THE LABOR ORGANIZATION. WITH CORRESPONDING COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS BY EACH. LITTLE TOWN RANCHERIAS COMPACT ALSO INCORPORATES ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF GAMING PROJECTS BY IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPPOSITION IMPACTS AN APPROPRIATE MITIGATION. THE UPDATED CONTACT LIMITS THE SCOPE OF COVERED PROJECTS TO DEVELOPMENT TYPE ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE LIGHT STATES LONG STANDING APPROACH TO CONTACT IMPLEMENTATION. THE COMPACT PARALLEL STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESSES ALLOWING FOR CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS AND NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS. THAT DATACOM ALSO CLARIFIED WHO IN WHEN THE TRIBE MUST NOTIFY. DURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS WHICH ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO REQUEST A MEETING CONFER WITH THE TRIBE REGARDING MITIGATION. IF THE TRIBE IS NOT ABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY MITIGATE OR AVOID IMPACTS THAN THE TRIBE MAY COMPLETE A STREAMLINED TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT DOCUMENT. IT WILL BE OPERATING LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY GAMING DEVICES OR OTHERWISE IT WOULD NEED TO DO A FULL TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. THE TRIBE MUST ALSO COMMIT TO MITIGATION FOR IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL CITY COUNTY OR CALTRANS IN CERTAIN INSTANCES. IF AN AGREEMENT IS NOT REACHED ON MITIGATION. EITHER THE TRIBE OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY SEEK ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS TO ADDRESS ANY ALLEGED BREACH IN TO ENFORCE CONTACT TERMS. CONTACT IS TO ENCOURAGE GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE DISAGREEMENTS. BUT ULTIMATELY PROVIDES FOR COURT RESOLUTION IF NECESSARY. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES TIME TO GO OVER MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIAS UPDATED CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BELIEVES DRESSES THAT APARTMENT INTERIORS CONCERNS.

SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA LIKE MIDDLE RANCHERIAS CONDUCTING GAMING PURSUANT TO A NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPACT THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATIFIED ITS NEW COMPACT. BUT THAT CONTACT WAS ALSO DISAPPROVED IN NOVEMBER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WORKED IN CLOSE CORRECT COLOR COORDINATION WITH THE SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA TO UPDATE ITS TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPACT TO ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CONCERN EXPRESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. CONSISTENT WITH NINTH CIRCUIT CASE LAW IN OUR REVIEW OF PAST INTERIOR ACTIONS. THIS UPDATED CONTACT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE GREAT EFFORTS OF TE SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA TO NEGOTIATE A COMPACT THAT PROTECTS BOTH PARTIES INTERESTS AND ADDRESSES INTERIORS CONCERNS. SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA CURRENTLY OPERATES APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND GAMING DEVICES AT ITS TACHI PALACE CASINO RESORT IN KINGS COUNTY.

IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT ONLY GAMING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TRIGGER AT THE REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. BECAUSE SANTA ROSA RANCHERIAS ALREADY OPERATING WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY GAMING DEVICES THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS REQUIRES FULL TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR A GAMING PROJECT THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION OR NEGATIVE DECLARATION. AS FOR MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS IN SANTA ROSA RANCHERIAS UPDATED CONTACT CLARIFY WHO IN WHICH ENTITIES ARE NOTIFIED OF A NEW PROJECT. THE BACK OF SALES TO MINORS ARE SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED IN THIS COMPACT THE TRIBAL CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE STATE CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT ORDERS AGAINST NON TRIBAL MEMBER CASINO EMPLOYEES. SANTA ROSA RANCHERIAS UPDATED CONTACT INCLUDES THE SAME TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE FROM ITS TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPACT.
