00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:40.706
CARE SYSTEM AND I SAW THE AMOUNT

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.809
OF TRAUMA THAT THEY EXPERIENCED

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:47.546
AND HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND A

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.982
WAY THROUGH THE ACTS. AND NOT

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.750
JUST THE CHILDREN BUT ADDITIONAL

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:54.853
HEARINGS AS WELL THAT WHEN GIVEN

THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO FIND

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:03.228
WAYS- TO REUNITE THEIR FAMILIES

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.798
AND SO THAT IS KIND OF GUIDED

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:10.135
THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THE

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:12.338

FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT AND AS I

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.194
CONTINUED THROUGH MY CAREER WITH

COMMUNICATION- PROGRAMS THAT

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.777
WOULD. INTERVIEWING I SAW A LOT

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.745

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:19.491
THAT I CAN- IT WILL MAKE THESE

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:20.926
DECISIONS THAT ARE VERY

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:24.129

EXPERIENCE I HAVE. REPRESENTING

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.736

ACCOMPLISHMENTS ATTORNEY BUT

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.674
MORE IMPORTANTLY MARC PERSONAL

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.175
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WHAT I FIND

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:23.455
CONNECT WITH THEM AND ALSO IT

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.157

NEED NOT ONLY WORDS OF HOPE. BUT

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.331
A CONCRETE ROADMAP FOR CHANGE

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.599
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.901

MY EXPERIENCES THAT RESONATE

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.088
WITH ME IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.223
SENATORS QUESTION ONE IS. OVER

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.227
THE YEARS AND WORKING WITH

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:02.694
PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:06.331
BACKGROUNDS. THE BILL BOTH IN IN

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.733
THE MILITARY WHEN I SERVED IN

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:10.102

DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES AND

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:25.083
THAT HAS TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.519
RECOGNIZING THAT. AND WHEN I DID

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:28.954
TO PAROLE HEARINGS ARE IT

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:32.824

EVERYBODY. GROWS UP THE SAME WAY

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.429
OR IS EXPOSED TO THE SAME THINGS

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.664
. THE OTHER THING I'VE LEARNED

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.799
AS A IN MINISTRY LAW JUDGE HOW

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.768
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:45.570
HEARD BECAUSE- THEY WANT TO BE

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.073
HEARD THEY WANT TO BE HEARD AND

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.108
LISTEN TO. AND I HAVE FOUND

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:52.644
THAT- MY EXPERIENCE DOING THAT

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:57.149
OVER THE YEARS HAS BENEFITED ME.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.051
TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF.

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.219
OF PEOPLE WANTING TO BE HEARD

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:03.622

MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU AND THEN

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:16.034
ONE OTHER QUESTION AND I

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.502
REVIEWED THE MATERIALS LAST

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.137
NIGHT AND I'M SORRY ADDED MASS

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.673
THIS DURING THE MEETINGS BUT- I

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.775
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.712
TO HEAR- WE HAVE A CHARGER I DID

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:28.647
IN SOME OF THE MATERIALS

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.615
PROVIDED TO ME. OF THE PERIOD OF

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.918
DENIAL BEFORE AN INMATE BECOMES

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:35.754
ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEXT PAROLE

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.656
HEARING DATE. AND AN

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:39.558
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.960
WERE FOR THREE YEARS OR FIVE

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.062
YEARS THAT SEEMS TO BE PRO FORMA

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.131
. BUT FOR COMMISSIONERS DOBBS

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.467
LONG AND MINOR. THERE WERE A

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.935
CHUNK OF PEOPLE THAT WERE TEN

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:51.803
YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.841
WAS GONNA ASK WHAT ARM. WHAT WAS

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.476
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.277
BEFORE ALLOWING SUCH A LONG

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:02.314
PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.549
ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR NEXT PATROL

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.685
BOAT PAROLE HEARING AND THAT

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.220
WOULD BE DOBBS LONG AND MINOR

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.155
THOSE WOULD BE THE THREE OKAY

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:13.525
THANK YOU. LET ME START BY IN A

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:14.693
DIFFERENT ORDER AND GO WITH

COMMISSIONER MINOR FIRST AND

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.063
THEN I'LL GO TO LONG AND DOGS

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.831
BUT I'LL CALL ON YOU AGAIN

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.699
SEPARATELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.634
THE COURT REPORTER SO-

AHEAD. LONG LONG DENIALS ARE

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:30.942
BASED ON. NUMEROUS FACTORS AND

REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:35.380
A FENDER CHANGE. AND SO IF THERE

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:37.616
IS AN INMATE WHO HAS SHOWN. AT

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:40.152
PRETTY MUCH ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE

THERE THERE AND THERE ARE MANY

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:00.806
BUT THERE ARE SOME AND THERE ARE

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:03.241
SIGNS THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.509
DON'T WANT TO CHANGE WILL COME

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.444
INTO THE HEARING ROOM AND TELL

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:07.679
US. THAT THEY'RE NT CHANGING

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.114
AND THAT THEY'RE STILL INVOLVED

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.682
IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:11.950
INSTITUTION AND THAT THEY HAVE

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.752
NOT TAKEN ANY STEPS TOWARDS

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:15.921
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.023
SO IF WE DON'T FIND BY CLEAR AND

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.791
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT EIGHT

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:23.161
LENGTH OF TIME- READY SOONER IS

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:25.530
APPROPRIATE THEN WE ASSIGN. THE

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:30.769
APPROPRIATE TIME BASED ON ALL.

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:31.570
OF THE FACTORS THAT WOULD

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:33.738
REVIEW. THANK YOU ARE. SORRY IS

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:36.041

PERFECT I COMMISSIONER LONG. SO

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:43.882
I SIGNALED ROW NINETY- IS.

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:47.085
SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY- A

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.721
LOT OF THOUGHT INTO AND REALLY

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:52.290
THE MAIN FACTOR IS ARE THEY

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.325
STILL DANGEROUS CERTAINLY STILL

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.660
VIOLENT TYPICALLY- I DON'T

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:58.029
BELIEVE I'VE EVER SAID A FIFTEEN

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:58.997
YEAR TO UPGRADE BUT I HAVE HAD A

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:01.900
FEW TENURE TO NILES. IN THOSE

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:04.569
CASES- VOTERS TYPICALLY EXTREME

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:06.938
VIOLENCE AND EXTREME RECENT

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:12.310
VIOLENCE AND ARE ALSO- ALMOST

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:13.712
UNIVERSALLY WITH THOSE FOLKS

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.847
THAT ARE STILL ENGAGING IN A LOT

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:17.249
OF VIOLENCE IS THIS KIND OF

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.150
RESISTANCE TO CHANGE AND

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:23.421
PROGRAMMING. AND SO- DOES THE

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.790
FACTORS I THINK IT'S BATES DAYS

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.759
SIMPLY DON'T AREN'T READY YET TO

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:28.760
CHANGE AND THEY NEED A LOT OF

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.829
PROGRAMMING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.365
TO CONTROL THEIR IMPULSES INTO.

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:36.067
THIS- HE SAYS FROM THE VIOLENT

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:40.305
ATTITUDES AND- BEHAVIORS. THANK

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.740
YOU COMMISSIONER ODD AND

00:25:41.806 --> 00:25:45.777
COMMISSIONER DOBBS. YES SO I'D I

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:49.147
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING ALL OF MY-

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:52.450
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- AND THE

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:55.387
ONLY THING I COULD ADD IS THAT.

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:56.488
FIFTEEN AND TEN YOUR DENIALS ARE

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:59.024
EXTREMELY RARE AND IT'S USUALLY

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.993
A CASE THAT THE PERSON APPEARING

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.896
BEFORE US IS STILL INVOLVED IN A

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:07.465
HIGH LEVEL OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:09.668
SO THAT MAYBE TRACKING DRUG INTO

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.903
THE PRISON WARDEN ASSAULTS ON

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.407
OTHER INMATES- AND OF COURSE ALL

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:18.843
OF THAT PROVIDES A DIRECT LINK

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.512
TO THE THEM BEING CURRENTLY

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:23.381
DANGEROUS. AND ADDITIONALLY THE

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.884
OTHER ELEMENT IS THAT THEY OFTEN

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.185
HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:32.891
PROGRAMS- AND SO WE CHOSE THE

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:34.626
DENIAL LAND. IF IT'S HIGH DINNER

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:36.861
AND IT'S USUALLY THE ACCENTS OF

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:39.931

REWARDING AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.301
DENYING PAROLE OR GIVING A

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:53.004

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.378
SUSTAINABILITY ONCE THEY GET OUT

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:02.647
. OKAY LET ME START IN REVERSE

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.683
ORDER AND ASK COMMISSIONER HI

TYRA TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU THE

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:12.724
- REASONS TO GRANT OR DENY

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:15.260
PAROLE WE USE A STRUCTURED

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:18.897
DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK TO

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:22.267
LOOK AT THESE EMPIRICAL AREAS.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.836
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IN OUR

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:28.406
TRAINING THAT REFLECT OF THE OF

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.075
MITIGATING RAGER AGGRAVATING

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:34.646
FACTORS IN HOW WE REVIEW OF THE-

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.714
INMATES THERE THE- PERSONS OF

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.783
PEARL SAID ABILITY- SO THAT

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:44.189
COULD BE. THURMOND. CONDUCT

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.790
RELATED IT COULD BE HISTORIC

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:48.059
RELATED STATIC FACTORS WE KNOW

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.328
THAT STATIC FACTORS OVER TIME

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:53.431
MAY NO LONGER INDICATE THAT

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.366
DANGEROUS SO WE LOOK AT THE MORE

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.168
DYNAMIC FACTORS WHICH WOULD BE

00:28:57.235 --> 00:29:00.038
CONDUCT AKON DOCUMENTED CONDUCT

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.873
IN PRISON ABOUT HOW THEY

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.209
INTERACT WITH OTHERS WHAT

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.543
THEY'VE LEARNED IN THEIR GROUPS

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.613
AND PROGRAMS AND ADDRESSING WHAT

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.916
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE-

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.418
CHARACTERS. THAT LED THEM TO

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:16.321
MAKE THOSE. DECISIONS THAT

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:17.722
RESULTED IN THE A COMMITMENT

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.458
OFFENSES OR THEIR CRIMINALITY IN

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:25.029
GENERAL. BUT SO- WE LOOK AT

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:31.035
THOSE THINGS. OF YOUR RECENT

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:34.539
MISCONDUCT IS WAITED GIVEN MORE

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.709
WEIGHT THAN. MISCONDUCT IN

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:40.078
PRISON FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS YOU

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.714
KNOW. THAT HIS RECORD YOU KNOW

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.383
MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND SO ALL

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.920
OF THAT IS. IT CONTINUING

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:52.457
EVALUATION AND EVERY EVERY CASE

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.359
IS DIFFERENT WHICH IS THE

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.194
CHALLENGING PART FOR ME EVERY

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.363
CASE IS DIFFERENT EVERY ALL OF

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.398
THESE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:04.669
EVOLVED AND- BASED ON HOW HOW WE

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.804
REVIEW THE RECORD AND THE

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:09.107
RESPONSES AND WHICH INCLUDES THE

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:11.442
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THE

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:14.078
RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT- AND-

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.414
WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY. THE

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:21.686
SUSTAINABILITY. WE ALSO REVIEW

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.955
THINGS LIKE PEARL PLANS AND

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.957
WHETHER THE PERSON HAS PLANNED

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:28.893
FOR RELEASE WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.296
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:33.665
. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:38.570
TO FOR. TO DEVELOP. A PROGRAM ON

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:40.471
RELEASE THE DIVISION OF ADULT

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.507
PAROLE OPERATIONS WILL ALSO DO

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.575
THAT FOR INMATES WHO WHO HAVE

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.677
TROUBLE YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:48.079
HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT THE- AND-

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.447
BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND THEIR

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.049
THEIR CONNECTIONS THEY MAY NOT

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:52.884
HAVE SUPPORT OUT COMMUNITIES SO-

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:54.686
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT- THE

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.020
DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:58.623
OPERATIONS WILL HELP THEM WITH-

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.792
IT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. BUT WE

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.760
CAN ALSO ORDER THEM INTO THAT IN

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.529
TERMS OF HELPING THEM MAKE THAT

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.398
TRANSITION SO THOSE ARE THE

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.400
TOOLS THAT WE USE. THANK YOU

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:12.604
THANK YOU- COMMISSIONER REEF.

WHEN FOCUSING ON THE TOOL THAT

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.645
WE USE THE STRUCTURE DECISION

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.547
MAKING FRAMEWORK THERE'S

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:25.850
DIFFERENT DOMAINS WE INVESTIGATE

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:28.253
AND ANALYSE THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.588
DOMAIN IS THE MORE DYNAMIC

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:32.590
DOMAIN AND THAT'S A MAJOR CHANGE

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:35.126
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING THERE IS

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:36.561
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.663
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS INCARCERATED

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.398

ASKED. AND THE OTHER THING

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.626
THAT'S REALLY GREAT IS THAT IT

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.628

AS FAR AWAY AS IT IS EUROPE AND-

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.874
LATIN AMERICA THAT PROBABLY

SIGNIFICANT. IN THE OUTCOMES SO

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:48.058
I THINK OVERALL IT'S A BENEFIT

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:51.328
WE ALSO. ARE NOT. DRIVING THE

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:52.730

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.865
BURNING GAS AND- IT MEETING

CARBON EMISSIONS AND SO THERE SO

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:59.169

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:14.118
WE HAVE FOUND DOING REMOTE

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:15.419
PARTICIPATION HAS BEEN A LITTLE

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:18.022
BIT MORE CUMBERSOME AT TIMES BUT

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:19.890
I THINK WE HAVE NOTICED THAT

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.724
PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T ORDINARILY

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.559
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE HAVE DONE

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:25.362
SO. THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR-

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:27.831
COMMISSIONER TYRA YOU WANTED TO

OVERALL A BENEFIT FOR ALL AND IT

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:37.708
DID START WITH SOME TREPIDATION

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:40.144
AND A FEW HICCUPS- BUT OVERALL I

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.745
THINK THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:44.882
DRAWBACKS. OF BECAUSE WE DO SEE

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:47.551
INCREASE PARTICIPATION- WITH THE

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:48.986

I FIND THAT THAT IS A MUCH MORE.

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:17.681
REASONABLE AND MORE COMFORTABLE

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.783

COMES TO APPROVING OF FOLKS- AND

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.565

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.708
FOLKS AND TO ASSESS THEIR

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.610
SUCCESS IN THEIR REHABILITATION.

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:56.313
IT IS NOT TO SUBJECTIVELY GAUGE

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.181

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:16.960
INCREDIBLE HARM TO SOMEONE ELSE.

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.895

REASON TO BASE MY DECISION ON

THE VERY SMALL PROBABILITY THAT

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.735
