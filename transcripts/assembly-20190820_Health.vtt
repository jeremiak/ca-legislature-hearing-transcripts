HAS RAPIDLY BEEN INCREASING WE

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.540
ARE SEEN DEVICES ON THE MARKET

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:10.675
THEY LOOK LIKE USB FLASH DRIVES

FORMER EDUCATOR I CAN TELL YOU

THAT TODD THESE DEVICES ARE

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.317
VERY DIFFICULT TO TACT

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:21.453
ESPECIALLY THAT THEY'RE- USING

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:23.288

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.140
WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT TO

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.342

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.319
HARMLESS THIS FALSEHOOD WAS

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:03.621
TOLD TO BE TOLD TO ME BY MY

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:05.223

WERE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME. IT

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:23.041
WAS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.409
OF WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.111

CIGARETTES AS WELL AS WHAT I'VE

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.556
LEARNED ABOUT THEM. A FEW YEARS

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:46.224

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.562
CONSIDERED USING ONE MYSELF. I

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:52.197
BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE NEWER

ONE HELL TO GET A HEAD RUSH OR

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:58.036
A BUZZ FROM HIS BREEZES FIRE.

00:28:58.103 --> 00:28:59.604
THIS WAS A TINY METALLIC BOX

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.238
THAT FIT IN THEIR HANDS AND WAS

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:01.639
DISCREET ENOUGH TO HEAD IN

EVENTUALLY EVEN DURING CLASS.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.613
IT HONESTLY DID SEEM HARMLESS

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.214
REST OF THE TIME AND IT TAKES

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.416
OF THAT GREEN APPLE. WHAT I

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.417
DIDN'T REALIZE BACK THEN WAS

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.818
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CHEMICALS

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:14.419

SOME NICOTINE THAT I GOT

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.462
ADDICTED TO VERY QUICKLY. I

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:25.830
DIDN'T REALIZE OF THE RUSH I

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.765
THOUGHT WAS DUE TO NICOTINE

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:28.299

HEART RATE. AND I CERTAINLY

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.071
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD

EVENTUALLY NEED AFFECTS IN

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.107
ORDER FOR MY BODY AND BRAIN TO

FUNCTION NORMALLY. THERE'S SO

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:38.877
MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:39.944

TRADITIONAL RETAILERS SOME OF

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.809
THESE KIND MONTH POT TYPE

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.144
CONVENIENCE STORES AND SO THAT

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:10.848
WAS CONCERNING SO. MAYBE CAN

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:11.715
SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.650

WHAT IS STILL THERE WHAT WE'RE

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.292
DOING. WITH THE ENFORCEMENT

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:22.793
PIECE WITH THE STATE OF

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.130
CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR THE

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.932
QUESTION OUR FIRST PARTY THE-

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.134
YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.202
AS AS AN AUTHOR OF THE BILL IN

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:35.005
THIS SPACE EARLIER IN THE YEAR

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.774
WHEN I HAD SEVERAL BILLS BEFORE

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.342
THE JOKE COMMITTEE WE SAT DOWN

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.643
WITH ALL THE AUTHORS MASTER

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.778
GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN A

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.546
WORKING GROUP OVER SEVERAL

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:45.449
MONTHS TO DIVE INTO THE ISSUE.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.584
OF THIS YOUTH EPIDEMIC AS IT

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.853
RELATES TO YOU CIGARETTES AND

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.056
PART OF THAT PROCESS WAS

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:54.625
LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT WITH A

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:57.561
FINE TOOTH COMB AND I THINK THE

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:58.929
TAKE AWAY FOR MANY THE MEMBERS

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:01.198
PERHAPS INCLUDING YOURSELF WAS

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:04.068
THAT IT WASN'T AN AREA OF

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.303
STRENGTH ARE ENFORCEMENT.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.005
MECHANISMS AS RELATES TO

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:10.641
TOBACCO IN GENERAL RIGHT

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.777
CLEARLY A LOT OF. YOU KNOW

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:15.379
PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION HAD

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:17.614
BEEN EMPHASIZED IN THE SPACE

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.450
BUT A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:22.352
ACTIVITY TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.887
MEMBERS WE MET WITH THE PART OF

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.756
PUBLIC HEALTH AND A. B. C.

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:26.657
SEPARATELY WHICH TO

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.692
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONDUCTING

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:31.261
OPERATIONS IN A FOUR PART OF

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:33.130
PUBLIC HEALTH WASN'T ABLE TO

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:39.903
TELL US. HOW. OPTIONS ENGAGED

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:44.341
THEY WERE WHERE OF STE.

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:45.509
EDUCATIONAL REYES AND

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:46.076
PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAW

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.177
ENFORCEMENT BETTER BUT NOT AS A

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.846
ROBUST. SYSTEM AS WHAT WE FOUND

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:49.413
THE A. B. C. WHERE THERE IS

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:49.980
SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:50.514
FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND STING

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.915
OPERATIONS CONDUCTED STATEWIDE.

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.750
AND SEEM LIKE A MORE THOROUGH

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.919
EFFORT. TO ENSURE THAT THESE

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.154
PRODUCTS WERE BEING SOLD TO

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:57.921
UNDERAGE USE THAT OUR STORES

00:45:57.988 --> 00:46:00.858
NOW. I WALKED AWAY CERTAINLY IS

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.793
AS A CONSIDERATION FROM THOSE

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.994
MEETINGS THINKING THAT. WE MAY

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.329
WANT TO STREAMLINE SOME OF THAT

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:06.363
ENFORCEMENT I'M NOT SURE IT

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.598
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A B. C.

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:10.400
HAVE OFFICERS AT THE SAME

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.002
LOCATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO PART

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.669
PUBLIC HEALTH. TRYING TO

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:13.937
CONDUCT OPERATIONS I THINK

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:14.938
THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.640
IMPROVEMENT I ALSO THINK THAT

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:19.109
IS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING. BEYOND

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.377
WHAT WE'RE ABLE DOING THIS BILL

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.745
BUT I THINK SOMETHING THAT

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.947
REMAINS ON THE TABLE FOR

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:28.285
DISCUSSION. AND PERHAPS YOU

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:31.989
KNOW THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS.

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:32.556
EVEN THROUGH THE BILL LATER

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.023
SESSION WE MAY HAVE AN

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.459
OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS THAT

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:36.393
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.194
DO ADDRESS THAT THIS BILL

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:40.330
MANDATES A 20% TOTAL OF THE

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:41.431
RETAIL LOCATIONS TO HAVE A

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:44.034
STING CONDUCTED AND SO WE ARE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.169
GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.137
PRACTICAL REALITY OF HOW. HOW

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.206
THAT GETS DONE WHAT YOU

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:49.840
REFERRED TO MR CARS A DIFFERENT

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.276
YOU NOW CALL. AND TOBACCO

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:54.444
REMAINS THE SAME AS WE FIRST

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.680
DISCOVERED YOU COULD SELL.

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.715
TOBACCO TWO HUNDRED USE I

00:46:58.782 --> 00:46:59.650
BELIEVE FIVE TIMES IN FIVE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:00.617
YEARS WITHOUT LOSING YOUR

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:02.519
LICENSE. CURRENT LAW FOR

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.288
ALCOHOL WAS THREE TIMES IN

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.757
THIRTY SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.025
RECTIFIED THAT BROUGHT BOTH

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:11.495
STANDARDS DOWN TO THREE IN

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:12.095
THIRTY SIX IN THIS BILL BEFORE

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:16.567
YOU TODAY. AND THE PENALTIES ON

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:17.768
YOUTH OBVIOUSLY STILL EXIST IN

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.469
ALCOHOL WE CHOSE TO STRIKE THAT

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:20.337
FROM THIS BILL WHEN THE BILL

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:21.438
WENT TO JAIL COMMITTEE IS THAT

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.307
WAS AN AREA. THAT WE DIDN'T

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:25.142
FIND AGREEMENT AMONGST ALL THE

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.777
MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE ON THE

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:31.181
HOUSE. THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE I

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:33.083
DO REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE AND

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.885
PERHAPS IN YOU KNOW YOUR

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:35.719
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE BUDGET

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.487
MAVIS CARTY AND OTHERS WE CAN.

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:40.524
START TO ENGAGE THROUGH THAT

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:41.191
PROCESS TO SEE THAT WE GIVE THE

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.826
TOOLS. THE IT TOOK PART OF

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:44.628
PUBLIC HEALTH OR SOME TYPE OF

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.730
COLLABORATION WITH A. B. C. OR-

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.365
A REALIGNMENT OF DUTIES SO THAT

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:50.734
WE CAN EFFECTIVELY MAKE SURE.

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.936
THAT THESE RETAIL LOCATIONS ARE

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:53.770
IN FACT NOT SOUND TO YOU

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:56.006
BECAUSE THAT IS. ONE OF THE FEW

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.908
TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH YOU CAN

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:58.542
GAIN ACCESS TO SEE THEIR FROM

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.445
AN ADULT AN OLDER FRIEND ONLINE

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:07.451
OR FROM A RETAILER. YEAH AND-

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:08.485
THE FEES IS AN ISSUE I KNOW

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:09.486
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TODAY AND-

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.787
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.155
AT ESTABLISHMENT TO. TO PAY FOR

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:14.524
PROPER ENFORCEMENT. IT'S

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:15.993
OBVIOUSLY A VERY PROFITABLE

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:19.096
INDUSTRY. ON THE SALES WEEK I

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:19.696
ONE GOT GAS THIS MORNING AND I

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.965
TOOK A PEEK. AND IT'S- A MAJOR

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:23.800
ADVERTISING ON THE FRONT WINDOW

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:24.401
THE PROBLEM DISPLAY WHEN YOU

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.703
WALK IN SO THAT TELLS ME. THIS

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.971
PRODUCT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:31.742
FOR THAT STORE. SO IF WE NEED

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:32.476
TO INCREASE THE FEE STRUCTURE

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:33.810
LICENSING STRUCTURE TO PAY FOR

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:36.446
THIS. WE SHOULD BECAUSE THAT IS

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.715
CLEARLY HOW YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:39.950
GETTING THE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.618
WHAT THAT THAT THE STING.

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:44.221
OPERATION THAT COMPLETE CNN

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.856

MEASURES COMING FORWARD

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:55.365
RELATING TO. ONLINE SALES WHICH

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.266
IS ANOTHER PROBLEM HOW YOUNG

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.301
PEOPLE ARE GETTING A HOLD OF

00:48:57.367 --> 00:49:00.871
THIS. PRODUCT AND I REALIZE

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:01.471
THAT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:02.339

THESE FLAVORS ARE REALLY THE

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.981
HOOK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.949
THERE'S- POSITIONS THAT YOU YOU

TALKS ABOUT THE DOLLS MAKING.

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:21.124
DECISIONS BASED ON YOU KNOW HIM

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.392

OBVIOUSLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:19.282
SOME ASPECTS OF THE BILL THE

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.717
WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:25.122

THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND BEING

00:50:56.586 --> 00:50:59.856
PREEMPTED BY STATE LAW WAS ONE

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.291
OF THE BIG MOTIVATING FACTORS

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:04.261
FOR ME GETTING BEHIND. THE BILL

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.762

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.710
BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:21.745
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.780
RESTRICTIONS POTENTIALLY

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.882
COUNTIES CAN DO THEIR OWN STING

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:31.688
OPERATION CITIES COULD DO.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.222
THEIR OWN STING OPERATIONS

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:37.027
SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO IN THAT. I

00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.062
ACTUALLY AM WONDERING WHERE MY

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.297
INVITATION TO WORK WAS I WASN'T

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:40.897
INVITED HIM WE CLEARLY HAVE

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.599
JURISDICTION HERE. I WORK WITH

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.233
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.668
ON A REGULAR BASIS. I STOOD ON

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:45.435
THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:47.037
DOES FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.739
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I AM

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:51.141
DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE NOT BEEN

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:51.908
INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.210
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT.AND I

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.811
WILL AGREE WITH MR MCCARTY THE

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.413
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE IS

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.849
THE FLAVORS. THERE WAS A BILL

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:02.219
THAT WAS NOT HEARD THAT WOULD

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:03.553
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND WE

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.788
COULD I STILL WELCOME A ROBOT

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.656
DISCUSSED AROUND FLAVORS. WHICH

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.125
I BELIEVE IS THE SINGLE.

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:11.027
BIGGEST ISSUE ATTRACTING KIDS

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:14.965
TO USE THIS PRODUCT. STING

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:15.799
OPERATIONS ARE GONNA BE

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:18.034
DIFFERENT DPH HAS THEIR OWN

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.903
UNIT A. B. C. HAS OUR OWN UNIT

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.338
THEY ARE SEPARATE I DON'T SEE

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:24.875
HOW WE ULTIMATELY COMBINE THOSE

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:27.811
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I A

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.479
WE ARE GOING TO WHAT I DO A

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.647
RECOMMENDATION PASSED THE BILL

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.617
TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:34.584
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS IN THE

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.487
FUTURE AND IF YOU CONVENE

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:39.089
ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUP RUN

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.423
THIS ISSUE SINCE WE OBVIOUSLY

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.660
DO BOTH HAVE JURISDICTION I

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:44.261
WOULD APPRECIATE BEING A PART

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:49.332
OF THAT DISCUSSION. WHICH I.

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.201
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:54.204
COMMENTS WAS CHAIRMAN ONE POINT

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:54.771
A CLARITY THAT I THINK IT'S

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:55.405
IMPORTANT FOR THE CLARITY. OF

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:56.306
SOCIALLY WHAT WOULDN'T LEAVE

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.741
THE COMMITTEE OR THE PUBLIC

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.342
WITH THE IMPRESSION. THAT YOU

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:00.310
WERE SOMEHOW EXCLUDED FROM THE

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:01.611
PROCESS THE WORKING GROUP WAS

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.847
OF AUTHORS OF BILLS THAT WERE

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:07.017
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. BOTH IN

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.118
THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN OF COURSE

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:11.788
OF OUR SENATE COUNTERPARTS. I

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:15.225
BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A CO

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:18.194
AUTHOR TO ONE BILLS AND- WHAT'S

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.229
HOUSE THE JOINT AUTHORS MR

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:23.833
JOINT AUTHORS. TO CARD IN

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.434
MISTER ARE DID PARTICIPATE AS

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:28.905
DID. SO LAWCENTER CAR PASSED WE

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:29.706
DIDN'T GET ALL OF THE CO OF THE

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:31.508
CO AUTHORS OR JOINT AUTHORS FOR

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:32.842
THAT MATTER IN EVERY MEETING.

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.544
BUT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THAT

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.145
GROUP DIDN'T INTEND TO EXCLUDE

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:36.079
YOU AND AS WE- OPEN UP A

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.314
WORKING GROUP TO THE LARGER

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.149
TOPIC WHICH I THINK IS. THE

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.250
CIGARETTES PART PUBLIC HEALTH

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:41.484
ENFORCEMENT. IT'S ENTIRELY

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.419
DIFFERENT THING AND I THINK THE

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:43.720
APPROPRIATE. COMMITTEE CHAIRS

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.854
BE INCLUDED WOULD INDEED BE

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.122
APPROPRIATE AND THAT WOULD BE

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.624
MY RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.359
WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE. IN

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:51.061
THAT CAPACITY AS WE MOVE

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:55.165
FORWARD TOWARDS NEXT YEAR. BUT

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:55.799
IT TO THE WAS A POOR TO CLARIFY

00:53:55.865 --> 00:54:00.070
THAT. APPRECIATE YOU KNOW

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:00.670
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE DIFFERENCES

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.838
OF OPINION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:05.175
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN. OUR

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:05.942
MEMBERS ISN'T THE NOTION THAT

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:08.345
WE NEED TO. ELIMINATE ACCESS TO

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.480
THESE PRODUCTS FOR YOU WHERE WE

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.181
DO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT IS

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.782
LIMITING ACCESS TO PRODUCTS FOR

00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:17.053
ADULTS. RIGHT THOSE LEGITIMATE

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:17.721
YOUR MERIT MERITORIOUS

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:18.822
ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT

00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:22.792
QUESTION BUT I THINK THE ISSUE

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.127
IS TOO IMPORTANT TO OUR YOUTH

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:26.463
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SOMETHING I

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:27.597
THINK THAT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:30.600
WHAT WE'RE DOING. TODAY I'VE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:34.371
STATED VERY CLEARLY THIS BILL

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:38.408
COMING INTO THIS. WAS FOR. NOW

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:41.511
IS NOT THE FLAVORS WE'RE NOT

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:42.112
NAY TIRE ALIGNMENT ON THAT BUT

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.380
I THINK RATHER THAN STOP. THE

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:44.914
PROCESS OF ALL THE OTHER

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:46.249
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT ARE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.418
IMPORTANT AND COULD ELIMINATE

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:49.519
SOME OF THIS ACCESS IS PRODUCTS

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.020
WILL TO MOVE FORWARD IN

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:50.553
AGREEMENT ON THOSE AND-

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.588
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.356
WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENCES SO

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:54.491
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:55.091

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:10.473
MAKE. ONE MORE COMMENT OKAY

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.976
CHAIR GETS TO DO THAT. AND THAT

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:13.410
IS WHAT WE DO HAVE A

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:13.977
DISAGREEMENT ON THE FLAVORS

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.312
PORTION OF THAT I DID NOT FEEL

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:19.349
THAT I WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:21.351
IN STATUTE. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:24.688
BE OF LESSER AFFECTED THAN

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.756
WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE BY

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:29.292
CITIES AND COUNTIES OUT THERE.

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.327
AND ONE OF THOSE KEY FLAVORS TO

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:32.862
ME IS MEANT AND WHILE WE

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:35.165
DISAGREE THAT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.733
OLD OR A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.968
CALIFORNIA LAW IS THAT TWENTY

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:40.070
ONE IS THE LEGAL AGE.

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:41.838
UNFORTUNATELY MEANT IS ONE OF

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:44.808
THE MOST POPULAR FLAVORS FROM

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:45.375
THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:50.880
YEAR OLD. AND THE THX AGE

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.215
GROUP. AND I IF YOU LIKE THE

00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:53.249
STATISTICS WOULD BE HAPPY

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:54.417
PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT BUT IT IS

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:55.318
THE MOST POPULAR WITH THAT AGE

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.886
PARTICULAR AGE GROUP. SO I LOOK

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.655
FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.323
ABOUT THIS THE FLAVORS WILL

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.492
CONTINUE TO BE A HUGE ISSUE FOR

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.527
MOST OF US. I HAVE SERIOUS

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:07.197
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:10.066
THIS PRODUCT THE INDUSTRY

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:11.301
RECENTLY I BELIEVE HAS SUE THE

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:14.971
FDA. TO DELAY TESTING OF THE

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:17.373
PRODUCTS WHICH I FIND.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.342
DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.211
IT FEELS THAT EVERY DAY WE SEE

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:23.179
A AN ADDITIONAL STORY ABOUT

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.347
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.082
RELATED TO THIS INDUSTRY.

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:27.517
INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY WHAT

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.085
STARTED OUT AS THIRTY ONE

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:30.954

RESPIRATORY AILMENTS IS NOW

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:34.424
BLOWN UP TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED.

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:35.658
AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT NUMBER

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.794
WILL PROBABLY INCREASE AS

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:40.930
FURTHER REPORTS COMMENTS SO WHY

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.398
THE A WEEK CLEARLY HAVE A

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.601
PRODUCT THAT IS EXPLODED IN

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:49.372
POPULARITY. BUT THE HELL OUT

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:50.573
HEALTH EFFECTS OF THAT ARE

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.744
STILL VERY VERY MUCH QUESTION.

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:59.783
I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT.

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:00.650
THE INDUSTRY WOULD PUSH BACK ON

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:01.217
