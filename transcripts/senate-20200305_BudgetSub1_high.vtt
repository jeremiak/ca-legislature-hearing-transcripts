STATISTIC IN HERE AND I'M HAPPY

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.580
TO ASK KELLY- ABOUT IT WHEN I

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.214
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN A COUPLE

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.249
MINUTES. THAT REFLECTS A WEEK

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.785
AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.119

WE HAD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.590
NINETEEN- AND PRESUMABLY WE MAY

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.291
HAVE MORE OR LESS BUT- IT'S

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.493
RIGHT AROUND THE BALLPARK. AND

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.962
ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FTP

THAT STATISTIC HAS ANY VALIDITY

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.546
THAN WE IT APPEARS WE HAVE A

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.881
RATIO OF. ONE PRINCIPLE OR

TEACHER IN THE STATE. ANY IS

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.794
THAT AN ANALYSIS OR IS THERE

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.796
ANY SIMILAR ANALYSIS THAT GOES

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.698
ON WITHIN YOU WERE. A

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.233
DEPARTMENT AS TO WHETHER WE

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.701

THE CLASS ROOM. CENTER FOR

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.809
QUESTION AT JUST THAT WE SPEND

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.944
MOST OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.379
HOW SUPPORT DECATUR'S FROM ALL

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.847
BACKGROUNDS DR GREX IS GOING TO

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.883
TOUCH ON. THE RATIO BUT WHEN

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.386
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE BUDGET

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.654
CALLS FOR AROUND TRAINING. IT

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.089
SPLITS THE TRAINING FOR PERFECT

ADMINISTRATORS AND IF YOU THINK

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.561
ABOUT ALL THE RESEARCH ABOUT

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:26.065
WILL NEED TO DO TO CLOSE. THE

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.300
GAP IT TALKS ABOUT WE NEED TO

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:34.840
SUPPORT AB ONE ARMY. AND NOT.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.408
RIGHT AND HAVING I JUST AND

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:36.042
MANY PART OF THE ANALYSIS ABOUT

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:36.609
HOW DRIVE MY MONEY AND THE

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.377
CLASS. YOU KNOW STUDENT

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.845
SPENDING HOW MUCH MONEY

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.480
ACTUALLY FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.716
CLASSROOM AND WHETHER THERE.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:44.717
ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE IT

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:48.354
JUST CONSIDER AND I'M NOT BEING

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.525
CRITICAL I WHICH IS. IT CAUGHT

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:55.928
MY ATTENTION. TODAY AND I

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.830
THOUGHT I'D AT. I WOULDN'T TO

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.498
ADD ON WHAT ARE SUPER SPOKE

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:00.900
ABOUT YOU AS A FORMER PRINCIPAL

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:05.204
I HAD A SCHOOL SITE OF ABOUT

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.106
SIXTY TEACHERS AND I HAD AN

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:07.740
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL VERY LUCKY

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.175
BECAUSE I OVER A HUNDRED

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.744
STUDENTS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.746
EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL FIRE.

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:15.614
AND DISTRICT AND THE NEED TO BE

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:19.685
SIDE SCHOOL HOW. IRV DATE IT'S

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.020
REALLY HOW MUCH IS THE RACE

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:22.621
BETWEEN OUR STUDENTS AND OUR-

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:23.723
AND THEY ALSO DISTRICT

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.391
ADMINISTRATION SO THERE'S

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.025
DIFFERENT LAYERS. OF

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.360
ADMINISTRATORS WITHIN THE

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:30.162
SCHOOL IN A COUNTY LEVEL TO

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:31.163
REALLY HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.000
THAT. TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.369
RATIO BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.737
PINPOINT IT WHEN YOU HAVE

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.106
DIFFERENT CONTEXT AND

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:40.973
DEMOGRAPHICS THROUGHOUT THE

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.943
STATE WITH OUR BEST. HAVE IT

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.345
THE STATE ON THAT IT TO

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:49.315
BENCHMARK WHAT. RELY IT'S NOT A-

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.217
FIXED. RATE PRESUMABLY ANY

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:51.751
OTHER ENTERPRISE YOU HAVE

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.519
MANAGER SUPERVISORS IN THOSE

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.121
TWO ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.389
SUPERVISION AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.124
THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY. DO THE

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.394
WORK IN. AND THE WORKERS ARE

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.695
CERTAINLY VALUABLE IN THE

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:05.031
PROCESS AND- UNDOUBTEDLY NEED

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.832
TO BE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.434
OVER SEND SOME TO PROVISION BUT

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.938
IN THE EDUCATIONAL. ANY STUDY

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.509
IN A COMPETENT THE RIVER DONE.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.611
WHAT ARE IN PERHAPS BUT THEY

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.914
SHOULD BE IN EVERY. I DON'T.

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.849
THINK ABOUT THE RATE. PRINCE

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.284
PERSIST SURE OR DISTRICT

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.686
DIMINISH. AS A WHOLE I DO KNOW

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:30.122
THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES AROUND

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:34.827
PRINCIPLE ACTIVE WITH AND WHY.

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:39.765
THEY MEAN TO BE IN A PRINCIPLE.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.534
THAT THEY ARE PUTTING. BUT IS

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.071
THIS. MANY CPAS STUDY AGAIN I'M

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:45.905
NOT BE CRITICAL JUST WANNA A AS

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.606
THE I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF AN

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.709
INTERESTING- DATA POINT.

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.611
DEPENDING ON HOW WE DEFINE SOME

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.580
OF THOSE TERMS IS THAT YOUR

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:55.581

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.216

HIGHEST- PARTY DISTRICTS WHICH

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:08.833

PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.078
DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH THE

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:21.546
COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.348
GRANT WHICH AGAIN IS A MODEL

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:25.016
THAT HAS BEEN INNOVATIVE AND

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.484
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THAT WERE

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:30.788
SEEN IN OUR SCHOOLS. NEXT TO

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:32.123
I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.758
IN ADDITION TO THE SIX HUNDRED

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.360

EDUCATION PRESCHOOL EARLY INNER

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.833
GEN WHICH WILL GO TO DISTRICTS

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:43.201
THAT ARE CURRENTLY SERVING OUR

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:44.936
SCHOOLS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.504
NEEDS THIS IS SIMILAR IN FACT.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.406
NEARLY SOME ARE IDENTICAL TO

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:49.207
THE GRANTS THAT WE DID LAST

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.776
YEAR IN THE SAME THERE'S SOME

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:54.412
SLIGHT VARIATIONS THAT WILL BE

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:55.013
DISCUSSED ON THE NEXT PANEL.

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:57.849
THE WITH. OF ANY OTHER. YOU

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:58.816
KNOW WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:00.918
TO. THE BUT I'M SURE THEY CAN

00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:02.387
WAIT TO DIFFERENT. BUT IF YOU

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:05.757
ANY. I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER.

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:06.824
THANK YOU MA'AM YOU PROBABLY

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.760
YOU HEARD MY QUESTIONS OF THE

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.628
LAST PANEL JUST TO SORT OF. I

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:14.032
GUESS SET THIS UP BY I. IN

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:17.435
CURIOUS AS TO WHEN WE DECIDE TO

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.737
MOVE OUT WITH ONE TIME MONEY IN

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:23.608
VARIOUS PROGRAMS. IF THERE ARE

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:25.143
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.811
SAID THAT ARE SENT OUT AS TO

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.313
WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:29.681
THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY

00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:32.083
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. ALL OF THE

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.718
PROGRAMS IN THE LIST THAT I'VE

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.486
REVIEWED ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:40.825
AND THEY ALL HAVE A GROUP OF

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:41.626
STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:44.028
PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM AS- HAVE.

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:46.364
THAT THE- EXPECT SURE WE DON'T

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:46.898
SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.433
THINKING ABOUT THAT AND I THINK

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:51.169
MAYBE. IF WE DON'T DO IT THIS

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:53.471
YEAR ONE IF I'M STILL AROUND IN

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.006
THIS YEAR WE'LL DO IT NEXT YEAR

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:57.175
AND TAKE A LOOK BACK. AS TO HOW

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.609
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE SPENT

00:32:58.676 --> 00:32:59.344
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.045
ON ACTS AND SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:03.147
DOLLARS AND WHY AND WHAT WE GET

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:06.117
FROM IT SO. I'M THINKING MAYBE

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:06.751
WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THAT AT

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.619
THE FRONT END. KNOWING THAT AT

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:09.754
THE BACK AND IF I'M HERE I MAY

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.422
BE ASKING QUESTIONS AND I'D

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.091
HATE TO SURPRISE ANYBODY WITH

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:15.827
MY QUESTIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:17.528
IF THE EDUCATOR WORKFORCE

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:20.732
INVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM IS AN

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:21.766
EXTENSION. WE HAD IT LAST YEAR.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.068
I RECALL RIGHT. WHAT WHAT

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.104
RESULT DID WE GET FROM THE

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.574
EXPENDITURE LAST YEAR AND IS IT

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.442
TOO EARLY TO ASK THAT QUESTION.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.311
WHICH SOMETIMES IS THE CASE SO

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:35.580
THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER ONE OR

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:39.250
TWO. OR IS THE ISSUE WE DIDN'T

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:40.918
SET UP ANY METRICS TO BEGIN

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.987
WITH WITH THREE WITH RESPECT TO

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.989
THE PROGRAM. AND I COULD I

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:47.458
COULD GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM.

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:48.359
IN THE ONE TIME EXPENDITURE

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.927
CATEGORY AND ASKED THE SAME

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.329
QUESTION NOW THIS IS SORT OF

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:52.497
THE OVERVIEW AND WILL HAVE AN

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:54.065
OPPORTUNITY LATER TO GET INTO

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:55.933
IT BUT I'M HOPING WHEN WE COME

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.735
BACK AND REVISIT SOME OF THESE

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.871
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. EITHER AT

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:01.839
THE TIME THAT WE TAKE A VOTE OR

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.375
BEFORE THE WE CONDUCT THAT SORT

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:07.044
OF EXAMINATION BECAUSE MY THE

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:08.246
QUESTION YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.681
THE MILITARY SO. YOU KNOW GETS

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:14.652
MEASURE GETS. AND HOW ARE WE

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.088
DETERMINE WHETHER WE'VE ONE WAR

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.890
OR LAW. ABOUT WE AGREE WITH YOU

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.291
IN WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.325
LOT OF MONEY SPENT IN EDUCATION

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.394
OVER MANY YEARS THAT HAVE NOT

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:24.862
HAD THAT FOLLOW UP ON ABOUT

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.798
EVALUATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.699

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:41.846
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT. YOU

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:42.847
WE'RE TRACKING WHERE WHERE.

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.549
WHAT WORKS IF. WORTHY OF

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.017
INVESTMENTS AND WHAT DOESN'T.

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:47.919
THERE'S ALSO A DEEP COMMITMENT

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.420
TO CONNECT ALL OF THESE LESSONS

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.655
LEARNED FROM THESE PROGRAMS.

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:52.089
CONNECT THEM TO THE STATE

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.658
SYSTEM OF SUPPORT SO FOR

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.796
WELL. ON THE COUNTIES WILL BE

00:34:58.863 --> 00:34:59.897

THESE PROGRAMS AND ABLE TO HELP

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.401
OTHER SCHOOLS THAT MAY NOT

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:05.403
NECESSARILY RECEIVE THE GRANT.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.840
BUT SIMILAR PULLS IT JUST. IS

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:13.811
WHAT. BE OUT OF. WORK WITH

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:14.779

DEEP AND FILES BUT NONE OF THAT

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:18.349
IS IN ANALYSIS I'VE READ AND I

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:20.084

GUARANTEE IS LOWER WE WOULD

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:17.722
PROBABLY MAKE A LARGER

WITHDRAWAL FROM THERE IS IF. I

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.062

HUNDRED. DIFFERENT SO WHICH OF

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:39.910
THE IDENTICAL FOR A- STATE

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:43.314
BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.348
CONTINUING TO MY- SOME RISKS TO

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.853
GROWTH ISN'T AS FAST AS IT WAS

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:50.921
PREVIOUSLY- BUT BASED ON WHAT

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.022
WE NOTED NO TODAY WE THINK THE

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.524
GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORWARD A

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.992

FEW DAYS. BUT I THINK- WE

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.206
ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.641
DIFFERENCES WILL NARROW BY THE

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:11.876

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:16.380
MAY. TURNING TO PAGE FOR. ALL

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.081

POINT 29% COST OF LIVING IN.

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:37.001
WENT ONE TIME. IS FOR THAT

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.002
COULD DIMINISH AROUND EDUCATION

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:40.204
WORK FORCE. OR FOR IMPROVING

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.672
ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AT CERTAIN

LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS. PAGE

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.310

THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THEY

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:50.781
YOU GET INTO ALL OF THOSE LATER

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:53.984
THIS YEAR. I TURNING TO PAGE

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:54.585
SIX. I WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.986
BUDGET HAS SOME POSITIVE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:58.389

THERE'S A MIX. OF A ONE TIME AN

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:06.397
ONGOING PROPOSALS- WE THINK

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:08.299
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:08.866
GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:09.400
BUDGET CUSHION IN CASE THE

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.482
WHO'S MANY JUST TO WITH

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.117

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:38.963
PARTICULAR SOME OF I CAN ARE A

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.531
WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE-

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.132
WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE UNDER.

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.234
CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS THE GOV

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.604
IS CAN. OUR CONCERN THAT SOME

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.806
THE OLD NOT ALLOW WITH THE

HAVE VERY MUCH DETAIL A HOW THE

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.619
FOR WOULD BE YOU. IF THE TO

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:07.625
EVALUATE IT. GET ME SIR THAT

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.960
THE BUDGET DOES NOT PROVIDE.

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.095
ALL THAT MUCH IN FISCAL RELIEF

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:12.663
FOR DOES. DISTRICTS ARE FACED

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.231
HIGHER COST PER FOR VARIOUS

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:15.799
SOURCES PER HIGHER PENSION AND

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:16.333
GROWTH AND STUFF EDUCATION

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.335
COSTS. AT THE BUDGET DOES THAT

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:20.337
COLA BUT GIVEN ALL OF PRESSURE

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.705
WITHIN DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING AT.

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:26.143

RECKON YOU CAN TO BUILD A

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:32.883
BUDGET THAT RELY ON A MIX OF

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.952
ONE TIME AN ONGOING SPENDING.

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.153
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.488
BE THE EXACT SAME ACCESS WHAT

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:39.189
THE GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD BUT

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:41.425
THAT IS A REASON STARTING POINT.

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.226
I WOULD RECOMMEND FUNDING. WILL

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:44.161
GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME PROPOSALS

THERE'S OTHER ONE TIME

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.507
PROPOSALS. IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:57.841
ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.777
WOULD FREE UP ABOUT A BILLION

00:42:59.843 --> 00:43:01.845

BE TO HELP PAY DOWN DISTRICT

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.027
FUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES THAT

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.862

ASSISTING BASIS. IN ADDITION TO

PAYING DOWN ABILITY WE THINK

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.039
YOU COULD COME USING A PORTION

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.240

THE NEXT YEAR THEN COME DOWN A

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.982
LITTLE BIT THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.283
JUST COULD USE ABOUT THREE

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.518
MILLION TO SOME WITHOUT THAT

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.153

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.796
IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IN PRESCHOOL

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:42.232

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:50.907
CRITICAL. AND WE KNOW THAT

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.210
THERE ARE SOME IDENTIFIED

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:53.777
BARRIER. STUDENTS WHO

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.812
DISABILITY ARE NOT SIXTY TING

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.848
CATION. AND SOME OF THOSE ARE

00:51:57.914 --> 00:51:59.015
ALSO MENTIONED THEM IN THE

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:01.251

SECRET TO ANYONE THAT

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.390
SPECIALIZED FUNDING CONTINUES

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.893
TO BE- SOMETHING THAT TO OUR

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.461
ATTENTION IN EVERY DISTRICT

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:12.062
THAT WE GO TO ESPECIALLY WITH

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:12.696
THE DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:15.131
WORKING WITH AND- I WOULD SAY

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:17.067
BECAUSE OF- IN PART. THE

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.301
UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE HAVE

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.803
FROM THE FIFTH THAT'S BUT ALSO

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:22.205
BECAUSE- IT DOES WE DO HAVE

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:23.773
STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.143
AND REQUIRE A HIGHER LEVEL OF

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.047
SUPPORT AND SERVICE THAN OTHER

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.048
STUDENTS. TO BE ABLE. TO FOR ME.

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:34.417
AT THE LEVEL OF. IF CDS WHICH

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.819
IN OUR- SOME HAS MOVED FROM A

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.421

AND CARE AT SCHOOL SITES WHICH

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.585
THEN IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:09.653
BETTER OUTCOMES FOR ALL

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:10.453

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:13.189
TIMES YOU BRING IN SUPPORT.

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:15.058
THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY HAVE ON

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:16.226
A SCHOOL CAMPUS SO I THINK

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:19.629
THERE'S A LOT- TO BE HOPEFUL

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.431
FOR IN THE APPS AND WE STAND

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:23.466
READY. TO DO THE WORK AND ALSO

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:26.269
A PACK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.038
CONTINUE TO THE- FACT OUT IN

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:30.807
THE DESERT. I DO A LITTLE MORE

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:32.842
DATA CANNOT DO TELL ARE YOU

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:35.779
WELL I WILL THIS GOOD NOW WE

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:36.780
CAN PUT INTO THE NEXT PANEL.

00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:41.084
ARE YOU JUST BE. THIS MIGHT BE

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:44.020
A BEAST TO. OUR AS OPPOSED TO.

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:44.621
DOING AN OVERLY FOR MY- AND

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.890
SEVERELY. I'M ONLY SUGGESTING

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.291
THAT WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.926
FUNDING FORMULA IN GENERAL BUT

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.628
THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO SYSTEM.

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:53.463
AT LEAST TALK ABOUT TO SUSTAIN

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.399
A BASE THAT MORE EQUITABLE AND

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:59.369
THEN WE LOOK AT WHAT YOU KNOW

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:01.438
HOW WHAT ARE OTHER IT'S STILL.

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.974
HOW CAN WE SORT OF LOOK AT OUR-

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.042
OPTIONS. AND ALL A GRAPH.

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.210
REALLY THAT OVERLOOKED IN

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.912
POPULAR STUDENTS ABILITIES ARE

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:11.047
NOT JUST STUDENTS WITH THIS.

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:14.384
THEY'RE ALL FOSTER YOU. LEARNER

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:17.253
SINCE. BUT WE DON'T. MONEY THE

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.456
SPECIAL CAN I DON'T THINK MANY

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.624
DISPUTE ABOUT THE QUESTION IS

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:21.725
HOW THE WAY THE WAY WE

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:24.728
CURRENTLY ALLOCATED UNDER THAT

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:26.796
SIX OF TWO FORMULA. AND THE FAN

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:28.331
THE FUNDING ALLOCATION THAT WAS

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:30.667
LOCKED IN PLACE WHEN WE SET

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.902
THAT IN CONCRETE AND HOW WE

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:35.672
EQUALIZE THE YOU KNOW THE PER

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:38.041
STUDENT- DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.809
AND THAT NOW HOW DO WE DEAL

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.745
WITH THE FACT THAT THE

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.680
INCREASING NUMBERS OF

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:45.415
MODERATELY TO SEVERELY DISABLED

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:47.984
THIS. ACROSS IN A SETTING WHERE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.185
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T GET

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:51.621
ENOUGH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH THE

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.056
EDUCATE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.125
SO IT'S GONNA BE VERY INSTANT

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.826
CARS ISSUE MAY WE CAN STARTED

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:58.528
AT THE NEXT PANEL BUT I THINK

00:54:58.595 --> 00:54:59.129
WE'LL HAVE TO SCHEDULE LONGER

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.531

DON'T THINK IT WOULD

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.505

MARK THE ONLY. IF IN THIS

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.364
QUESTION ON THE TO A FIFTH

MILLION DOLLARS IN A WHISPER A

GONNA SAY JUST ABOUT EVERY

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.881
DISTRICT BUT EVERY DISTRICT. SO

WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.550
MILLION DOLLARS HOW DO YOU I

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.418
REALIZE IT'S ALSO SAYS IMPROVE

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.621

TIME SO THAT'S SORT OF A TWO

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.567
PART QUESTION AND THEN I'LL

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.768
GIVE YOU THE THIRD QUESTION IN

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.136
ADVANCE WHICH IS WHETHER WE

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.671
TAKE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.741
MILLION DOLLARS RECOGNIZE THAT

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:35.611
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA THREE

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:36.112
TO FIVE YEAR OLDS EARLY

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:38.114
INTERVENTION. I BELIEVE THE LA-

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.550
IS SUGGESTED BUT- REGARDLESS

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.451
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THAT AND JUST

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:45.087
CALL IT ON TIME. ONGOING RATHER

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.590
ONGOING FUNDING AND ALLOW THE

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.626
DISTRICTS TO SET UP AN RELY ON

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.762
A CERTAIN FUNDING STREAM. TO

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.697
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THREE TO

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:58.801
FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT. NO TO DATE

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.903
THEY'VE HAD DIFFICULTY DOING.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.672
THOSE ARE THE THREE QUESTIONS

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.507
PROJECTS THE TOTALS ONLY AS ONE

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.509
OF TIME BUT IN MOSCOW YOU GET

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:07.376
THREE OKAY HOPEFULLY I CAN

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:10.947
ANSWER THREE OF THEM ARE MEMBER

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.248
TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:14.283
ABOUT- HOW DO WE YOU KNOW

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.651
PROVIDE INCREASED IMPROVE

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:17.353
SERVICES. WITHOUT ADDING PERSON

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.488
NOW- I THINK THAT IN OUR SIDE

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:20.923
THIS IS A SUMMER AND WE HEARD

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.425
FROM A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE YOU

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.293
KNOW TRYING TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.062
TO THE PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN-

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:26.729
BUT THEY'RE COMING TO A LOT OF

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.097
BARRIERS WITH. EVEN FINDING

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.832
PERSONAL ALMOND SO THEY'RE

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:31.534
HAVING TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.035
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.238
GREAT EXAMPLE OF- CONTRACTING

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:36.639
FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.174
FOR EXAMPLE AS WE KNOW THERE'S

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.243
A SHORTAGE. A SHORTAGE THOSE.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.445
OF YOU SO THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:43.579
HIRE SOMEBODY SO WE GIVE THE

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:45.281
MONEY WE ALLOWED THEM TO HER.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.850
SO MAYBE THEY BUMP THE CUT THE

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.819
WAGE AND BENEFIT PACKAGE UP FOR

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.087
WHATEVER YOU CAN DO AND THE

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:54.757
EDUCATE ENVIRONMENT. SO PUTTING

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:57.226
ON A PER. IT'S ONE TIME MONEY

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.427
AND DOESN'T THAT MEAN IF THE

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.229
MONEY ISN'T THERE NEXT YEAR

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.231
THAT WE THEN DO WHAT WE LEYVA

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.600
PERSON OFF FOR WE SHIP FROM

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.936
SOMEPLACE ELSE OR WE CANCEL THE

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.571
PROGRAM I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.106
TO UNDERSTAND THE- THE LOGIC

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:14.310
HERE. BECAUSE THE USE OF THE

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:17.146
PHRASE INCREASED OR IMPROVED

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:21.417
SERVICES IS NOT MY PHRASE

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.318
THAT'S THE PHRASE THE

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:23.653
ADMINISTRATION USED IN PUTTING

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.888
FORTH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.523
THAT TO ME MEANS YOU'VE ADDED

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.891
SOMETHING AND YOU'VE ADDED

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.926
SOMETHING WAS ONE TIME MONEY

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.461
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AM

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.730
I MAKING IN MY MAKING SENSE YES

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.566
I THINK SO OF IT WHERE YOU CAN

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:40.870
SAY NO. I I'M UP. YOU KNOW I'M

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:42.872
A ONE YEAR IN A ROOM FULL OF

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.473
EXPERTS OF NOT EVERYTHING I SAY

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.709
MAKES SENSE GO AHEAD. OF ME

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.643
YEAH I KNOW AND I THINK THAT

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.012
THAT IS A GREAT- POINT AND WILL

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:50.946
DEFINITELY TAKE THOSE CONCERNS

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.416
INTO CONSIDERATION- AGAIN THE

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.551
FUNDING CAN ALSO BE USED AS FOR

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.919
EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES

01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:00.022
MORE BROADLY ON TO EXPAND AND

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.123
TSS RIGHT TO. THIS KIND OF

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.092
BUILD MORE SUPPORT BY THE

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.226
CONTRACTING WHETHER DOING

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:05.594
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.897
TENDS TO BE ONE TIME- COULD

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:10.099
REALLY HELP THOSE YOUNG

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.067
LEARNERS. BUT BUT WE DEFINITELY

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.637
YOU. DELIVERY OF QUOTE. IDEA

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.238
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE BUT

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.140
MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SELF

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.076
US US I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BOTH

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.411
OF YOU OR THE FIRST- LADY THAT

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.214
PRESENTED. I'M TRYING TO

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:26.582
UNDERSTAND WHY ONE OF MY SCHOOL

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.050
DISTRICTS DISLIKE SELFLESS SO

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:31.087
MUCH THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.389
FEEL THAT THE SELF WAS. FOR

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.858
ONLY THERE TO DENY SERVICES. TO

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.326
THE STUDENTS AND THE WIND UP IN

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.829
A LOT OF LAWSUITS AT- THIS

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.831
PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND I THINK

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.099
OTHER DISTRICTS TO I THINK THIS

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.734
DISTRICT JUST HAPPENS TO BE. A

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.435
BIT MORE. ALL SO DO YOU THINK

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.371
THAT. CHANGING THIS FORMULA

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.806
FROM THE A. B. SIX SO TWO

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:51.474
FORMULA THE EIGHTY A

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.376
CALCULATION WHICH CURRENTLY IS

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:56.112
AT THE SUPPLE LEVEL. CALCULATED

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:58.147
AT THE LA A LEVEL. WITH THAT

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:00.683
DAY IN DO YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.752
THAT ARE NOT HAPPY WITH SELF AS-

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:04.286
SORRY IT'S KIND OF A CONVOLUTED

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:08.991
QUESTION. THREE AND SO WHY

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.159
CAN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.328
DIRECTLY TO THAT PARTICULAR

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.197
ELEMENT IN THERE HELP US- WE'VE

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:17.733
HEARD JUST MAKES THINGS AND I

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.935
THINK THAT. SO THE REASON WHY

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.170
WE WANTED TO DO THESE

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.139
CALCULATIONS AT THE LA LEVEL IS

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:26.442
BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN-

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.344
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD AS A

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.013
CONCERN OF AND THE AS THE SB

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.882
SIX MODEL STANDS IT DOESN'T

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:33.849
REALLY REFLECT THE GROWTH OR

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:36.986
DECLINE- OF INDIVIDUAL ELEAZAR

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.854
REALLY JUST TAKES THE SALT INTO

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:42.158
ACCOUNT. AN AN **** OR YOU KNOW

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:45.795
THE ROLE OF AN REALIZE SERVICES

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:48.964
AND THAT RELATIONSHIP IT VARIES

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.866
SO MUCH ACROSS THE STATE WHICH

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.135
IS AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE WITH

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:55.471
PAYING WHY WE ARE. THIS

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:57.706
GOVERNMENT SO THAT WE EXAMINE

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.708
THIS BECAUSE OF THIS AND IS A

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.645
OF A BLACK THAT WE ARE NOT

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.847
QUITE SURE OF. THAT IS FAIR SO

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.316
YOU'RE BEING THAT CALCULATING

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:08.551
THE EIGHTY A CALCULATION OF THE

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:10.519
VALLEY A LEVEL WILL GIVE US

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.854
BETTER TRANSPARENCY THAN DOING

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.123
IT NOW WITH THE SELF LEVEL. YES

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.825
OKAY WELL TRANSPARENT IS ALWAYS

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.593
THANKS THANK YOU. THERE'S

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.229
ANOTHER STEP BECOMING OUT ISN'T

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.165
THERE IS PRIVATE STUDY GOING ON.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:27.837
AND SO THERE IS A- STUDY THAT

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.672
WAS PRIVATELY COMMISSIONED AND-

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.106
THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED BY WEST

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.175
ED AND THAT IS REALLY LOOKING

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.643
AT THE FINANCING OF SPECIAL

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:38.147
EDUCATION AND- SO FROM WHAT I

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.316
UNDERSTAND A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:42.418
I AM THE FINANCING OF SPECIAL

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:44.753
EDUCATION CALIFORNIA. HASN'T

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.789
REALLY BEEN DONE IN OVER TWENTY

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.457
YEARS SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.527
THEY'RE- JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:54.029
THINGS ARE AND GET SOME CLARITY

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.898
ON THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THINGS

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.067
STAND AT THIS CURRENT JUNCTURE

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.168
NOW WITH JUST WITH RESPECT TO

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.402
THE STUDY THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.037
BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IN

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.072
THE APPROPRIATIONS DO WE HAVE

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.174
SOME. CLEAR QUESTIONS THAT

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:08.277
WE'RE ASKING- BE ADDRESSED IN

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:11.380
THE CONTEXT OF THE STUDY SELF

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.615
OF WAS MENTIONED. SO I C&lt;c.cyan&gt; I&lt;/c&gt;

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:13.782
CAN TAKE BACK SO AGAIN

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.417
ADMINISTRATION VISION IS FOR TO

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.185
LOOK AT GOVERNANCE

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.220
ACCOUNTABILITY- YOU KNOW SINCE

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.421
THE CREATION OF SELFIES THERE

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.823
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AND

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.191
EDUCATION GENERALLY WITH THE

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:24.093
CREATION OF. ON THE AL CAPP

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.962
RIGHT THE DASHBOARD- ANDSO

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.163
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:28.964
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.266
PROPOSED BE LOOK AT IN THE

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.635
STUDY AGAIN WE ARE VERY OPEN TO

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:33.736
WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:35.070
STAFF. QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:37.640
LIKE TO SEE ANSWERED AROUND

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.240
GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.441
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. WELL I

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.076
ASSUME WOULD NOT. WITHOUT

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:43.479
SPECIFICALLY KNOWING. THAT PART

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.514
OF THE- RATIONALE FOR THE SELF

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.249
OF CREATION AND THE WAY BACK

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.984
WAS TO CENTRALIZE RESOURCES AND

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:52.621
PROVIDE SOME CENTRALIZATION OF

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.957
SKILLS AND RESOURCES THAT A

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.359
PARTICULAR DISTRICT MIGHT NOT

01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:00.029
BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MAINTAIN-

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.830
ON AN ON CALL ARE AS NEEDED

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:04.400
BASIS IS THAT. CORRECT YEAH

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:05.935
DEFINITELY SO THEY WERE CREATED

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.236
TO CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:10.539
RIGHT- IN PER CAPITA I SUPPORT-

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.308
SINCE YOU KNOW SINCE THEN THERE

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.742
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF- THE

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.110
CREATION OF SINGLE DISTRICTS

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.912
HELP US- AND SO THEY'RE JUST

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.080
BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AROUND

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.582
THAT ENDS THAT NEED TO BE

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.849
FURTHER LOOKED AT AND STUDIED.

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.485
RIGHT I SUPPOSE ECONOMIES SCALE

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:24.386
ONE THING THAT DOESN'T

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.655
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT MONEY

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:27.890
STILL HAS TO FLOW. IN THAT

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.558
DIRECT WHICH I ASSUME IS ONE OF

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.293
THE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED IN

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.163
THIS STUDY THAT YOU ARE GOING

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.764
COMMISSION. CORRECT YEAH

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.932
LOOKING AT THE FUNDING AND HOW

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.500
IT INTERACTS WITH EVIDENCE.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.502
THAT THE OTHER QUESTIONS

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:45.941
EARLIER. WHO'S NEXT. GOOD

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.476
MORNING SENATOR IS AMY LEE WITH

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.243
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.745
OFFICE THE SERGEANTS SHOULD

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.413
HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT FROM

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.716
CHILD SPEAKING WITH ON TODAY SO

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:55.451
TURNING TO PAGE ONE JUST

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.219
BRIEFLY BY WAY OF BACKGROUND

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:00.189
AND ELEVEN POINT 7% OF K.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.123
TWELVE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.758
RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.393
SERVICES AND THIS YEAR HAS BEEN

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.561
STEADILY INCREASING FOR THE

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:08.163
PAST DECADE ALONG WITH THE

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:09.098
INCREASE IN IDENTIFICATION

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:11.000
RATES HAVE. INCREASED IS IN

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.935
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS I'M SO

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:15.137
AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE FIGURE ON

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:18.040
PAGE ON. SO STATE AND FEDERAL

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.842
FUNDING LEVELS HAVE MAINLY ROOM

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.910
REMAINS THE SAME AS A RESULT

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.312
LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.647
MOSTLY THERE I'LL SEE IF I HAVE

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:25.314
HAVE BEEN COVERING A GROWING

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.149
SHARE OF THIS COST SUCH THAT

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.618
LOCAL FUNDING COVERS ABOUT 60%

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.553
OF COST COMPARED 250% A DECADE

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.857
AGO. TWO TWO FACTORS CONTRIBUTE

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.659
TO THESE GROWING COST. FIRST

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.160
THE SHARE OF STUDENTS WITH

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:39.695
RELATIVELY SEVERE DISABILITIES

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:42.064
HAS ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE TWO

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.699
THOUSAND AND NOW CONSISTS OF 3%

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:45.267
OF OVERALL STUDENT ENROLLMENT.

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:46.769
THESE DISABILITIES TYPICALLY

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:48.237
ARE MORE IN REQUIRE MORE

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:49.138
INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:51.206
SERVICES. AND THE MOST NOTABLE

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.776
RISES IN AUTISM WHICH AFFECTED

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.210
ONE IN SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS AT

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.845
THE TO TECH TWO DECADES AGO.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.047
COMPARED TO ONE IN FIFTY

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.182
STUDENTS TODAY SO THAT'S ALMOST

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.583
TWELVE FOLD INCREASE. ANOTHER

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.786
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS A RISE

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:04.586
IN TEACHER SALARY AND PENSION

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.422
COSTS ARE WHICH ARE ALL

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.290
AFFECTING GENERAL EDUCATION AS

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:12.061
WELL. MOVING ON TO EACH. OTHER

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:14.163
PHIL AT AT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.065
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.733
OBVIOUSLY PROVIDES FUNDING

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.333
BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.803
ATTENDANCE- AND STUDENT TENDONS

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.304
IS USED RATHER THAN A MORE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.939
DIRECT MEASURE OF COST. IN

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.207
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.176
THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.577
SCHOOLS HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.212
TO OVER IDENTIFY STUDENTS OR

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.513
SERVE STREETS AND UNNECESSARILY

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.682
EXPENSIVE WAYS WE THINK THIS

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:34.983
BREAKS THE FACT THAT HIGH

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.251
BETWEEN. BEING AN

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:37.853
IDENTIFICATION FOR STUDENTS.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.655
COVERED THE- ENDING AT THE PER

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:41.390
STUDENT FUNDING RATES UNDER AB

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:42.691
SIXTY TWO HAVE LARGELY VARIED

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.626
BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL REASONS-

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:45.694
AS FINANCE HAS ALREADY

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.197
MENTIONED IN THAT NINETEEN

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.798
TWENTY BUDGET AND THERE WAS A

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.500
DIRECTIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.435
MAKE STATUTORY CHANGES TO. THAT

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.503
WERE DESIGNED OF ACADEMIC

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.405
OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS- AS- A

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.607
REAL RESPONSIVE TO THAT DATE

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.042
MINISTRATION ENDED UP

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:01.677
IDENTIFYING SEVERAL CHALLENGES-

C. TO PROMOTE. THE PRACTICES.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:21.964
THIRTY ADDRESS THESE IT THE

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.298

EDUCATION PROPOSALS INTO THREE

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:35.911
GROUPINGS. SO ON THIS TABLE

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.913
HERE- WILL START COVERING I

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.148
WILL START WITH THE PROPOSED

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.949
BASED FUNDING CHANGES AND THIS

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.184
INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS WHICH

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.986
FINANCES ALREADY EXPLAINED- IN

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:49.358
TERMS OF THEM. THE LAST PAGE

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:50.559
THAT'S OKAY I'M JUST SLOW

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:54.496
APPROACH. AND THIS IS THE YEAH

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.297
THIS IS JUST A MEATY PART I

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.566
THINK WE'RE COUNTY RIGHT NOW-

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.868
SO IN TERMS OF THAT BASE

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.004
FUNDING INCREASES THIS WOULD

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.306
RISE GREAT RAISE RATES FOR A

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.141
MOST SELF AS TO SIX HUNDRED AND

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.509
SIXTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT WE%

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.644
FIND THIS PROPOSAL TO BE

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:09.878
CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:11.980
INTENT OF EIGHTY SIX OH TWO BY

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.315
ELIMINATING. RATHER ARBITRARY

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.950
DIFFERENCES IN BASE RATES AND

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.518
WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE ADOPT

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.120
THE PROPOSED I'M GOING BASS

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.522
AUGMENTATION. SECOND THE

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.191
GOVERNOR PROPOSES A THREE YEAR

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.292
ROLLING AVERAGE AND STUDENT

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.860
ATTENDANCE WE RECOMMEND ALSO

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.261
ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL AS IT

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:27.429
WOULD SMOOTH THE FUNDING FOR

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.630
DISTRICTS WITH DECLINING

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:29.965
ENROLLMENT WHICH IS THE CASE

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.266
FOR MOST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.001
WE DO HAVE A NOTE THAT GROWING

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.503
DISTRICTS MEETS THE SMALLER

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.772
ANNUAL INCREASES RELATIVE TO

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.307
THEIR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AS FAR

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.042
AS FINANCING REFORM GOES MORE

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.211
GENERALLY WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:43.579
SURE HOW THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.347
MINISTRATION CITED REALLY.

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.748
RELATE BACK TO THE SPECIAL

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.951
EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL ITSELF

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.319
WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX OF

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:52.521
TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.156
NECESSARY FRY FLEXIBILITY TO.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.624
FIND FUNDING IN WAYS THAT ALIGN

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.526
WITH STUDENT NEEDS AND THAT

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:58.227
INCLUDES THINGS LIKE PROMOTE

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.795
INCLUSIVE PRACTICES. AND

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:00.596
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STUDENT

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.130
SERVICES. AND WE THINK THAT

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.232
MENSURATION HAS YET TO

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.166
RIDICULOUS HOW THE CURRENT

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.101
FUNNY MONEY MODEL CONTRIBUTES

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.870
TO THE PROBLEM CITED. MAKING

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.304
IDENTIFYING WE ARE THOSE ISSUES

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.639
ARE ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL IN

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:13.208
TERMS OF GUIDING QUITE FUTURE

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.676
FUNDING REFORM LOOKS LIKE.

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:15.878
MOVING ON TO THAT SECOND ROLE

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.680
IN THE TABLE. WE DISCUSS THAT

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.249
STUDIES IN THE WORK GROUPS ARE

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:20.716
ALSO IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.718
PROPOSAL. AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:25.487
PROPOSAL PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:26.388
THOUSAND ONE TIME FOR STUDY AND

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.556
SPECIAL EDUCATION GOVERNANCE

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.291
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS A

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.260
COMBINED SIX HUNDRED MEN

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:31.927
THOUSAND ONE TIME TO CONVENE TO

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:34.663
BURKE GROUPS. HERE WE ARE

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.632
ENCOURAGED LEGISLATURE TO VIEW

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.866
THESE PROPOSALS AS

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.067
OPPORTUNITIES TO WEIGH AND

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.736
INFORM FUTURE PHASES OF SPECIAL

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.638
EDUCATION REFORM. THE TO THE

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.139
EXTENT THAT THESE PRIOR THESE

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.041
AREAS ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:48.143
PRIORITIES THAT'S FAIR BUT TO

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.077
THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.812
HAS OTHER PRIORITIES IN MAY

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.648
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT STUDIES

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.548
OR WORKGROUPS WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:54.349
IN PURSUING THOSE OTHER

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.551
PRIORITIES. SO FOR INSTANCE

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.853
MANY DISTRICTS ARE SEEN

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.354
INCREASES AND THEIR LOCAL

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:00.756
EDUCATION COSTS AS I MENTIONED

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:03.358
EARLIER. THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:07.462
CONSIDER FUNNY STUDY THAT WOULD

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:09.164
HELP I CAN'T AFFORD THE COST

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:13.101

DIRECTLY SUCH AS- THE

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:19.875
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER X.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.510
EGGS. IN TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:22.978
ASSISTANCE TO DISTRICTS

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:23.445

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:26.014
PRACTICES. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.050
PROPOSES BED TWO HUNDRED AND

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:29.284
FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR

PRESCHOOL AS DESCRIBED IN THAT

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:31.820
LAST ROOM THE TABLE. THIS

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.188
FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED IN

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.724
THE SAME- AS THAT NINETEEN

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:36.925

NINETEEN TWENTY. FUNDING THIS

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.235
FUNDING IS INTENDED TO INCREASE

OUR IMPROVE PROGRAM SERVICE

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:51.239
SAYS. AND SO ARE OUR CONCERNS

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.341
VERY MUCH A ONE TWO YEARS

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.642
SENATOR ROSS WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.177
SURE WHAT THE INTENTION IS WITH

IMPROVE IMPROVE OR INCREASE

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.216
PROGRAM SERVICES AND WE THINK

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.751
EXPECTING DISTRICTS TO DO SUCH

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:03.952
FRIENDS ARE RATHER CONFUSING

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.021
MESSAGES MESSAGE. DISTRICTS

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:06.688
WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:07.723
ADDITIONAL STAFF TO PROVIDE

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.191
MORE SERVICES WITH ONE TIME

EDUCATION. SERVICES AS- INTO

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.066
THE SLOT FUNDING AND FUTURE

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.034
UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THE WE READ.

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.268
THE LEGISLATURE SAD YOU THAT TO

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.303
PROPOSE TWO HUNDRED OF MILLION

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.604
INTO AN ON GOING BASIS

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.939
AUGMENTATION AND SETTING USE

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.908
THIS TO FIND INCLUDE A PRE

SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN INTO THE

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.044
BASE FORMULA. THE STATE DOES

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.246
NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDE ONGOING

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.180
FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS TO

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.648
SERVICE AGE GROUP DESPITE

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:34.816
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.118
DISTRICTS STARTS TO PROVIDING

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.519
SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:38.754
STARTING AND CAL TO THIRD

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.888
BIRTHDAY. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.857
EXPANDING THE BASE FORMULA TO

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:43.358
INCLUDE PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:44.292
WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:45.260
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE LOCAL

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.962
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.830
THIS AGE GROUP. WE ALSO WE

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.365
WOULD RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.034
BASE FORMULATO DOUBLE COUNT

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.201
FOR KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE AS

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:53.702
AN APPROPRIATE AND

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.704
STRAIGHTFORWARD METRIC THE

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:56.738
PROXY FOR PRE SCHOOL

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.939
ATTENDANCE. AND THAT CONCLUDES

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:59.174
OUR COMMENTS BUT I WOULD BE

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:00.709
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:02.677
SO WE HAVE FROM IF WE WERE

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.880
INTERESTED IN SWIMMING. WE WERE

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.314
ABLE TO REALLOCATE MONEY TO DO

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.150
THIS. IF WE WERE INTERESTED IN

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:12.020
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE- INCREASE

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.455
IN THE INCIDENCE OF MORE

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.390
SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENTS IN

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:16.758
THE MODERATE. TO SEVERELY

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:19.194
DISABLED CATEGORY. AND THE COST

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.662
INCREASED COST OF EDUCATING

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:21.997
THOSE STUDENTS TO BE ANY

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:24.166
IMPEDIMENT TO. US FOLLOWING

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.801
ADDITIONAL MONEY OUT TO THROUGH

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:28.003
THE SELFLESS TO THE DISTRICTS

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.137
FOR THAT PURPOSE ON TOP OF THE

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.906
BASE RATE. I THINK IT WOULD

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:33.041
JUST BE A FIX OUT AWAY TO MOST

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:34.609
APPROPRIATE ALLOCATE THAT MNEY

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.377
I THINK THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:36.511
CONSIDERATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.380
THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO THAT-

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.215
BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME MAIN

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.716
GUIDING PRINCIPLES THE

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:42.584
LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:45.287
HAVE IN MIND. FIRST IS HOW

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:46.521
CHANGES TO AB SIX OH TWO YOU

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.857
WOULD CHANGE INCENTIVES OVER

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:50.025
IDENTIFIER POTENTIALLY OVER

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.561
SERVE STUDENTS- IF WE DO FLOW

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.062
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:55.497
DISTRICTS AND FELL BUT AS THE

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.032
QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.433
CHANGES BEHAVIOR IN A WAY THAT

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.635
WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY INTEND TO

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:01.570
AS A STATE. ONLY HAS A

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:06.641
QUESTION- I'M UP I UNDERSTAND I

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.376
THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:11.313
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND. THE

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:13.849
CONCEPT IN THE IMPACT OF THE

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:14.816
CONCEPT IN THE CURRENT

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.918
SITUATION WHERE SCHOOL

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.087
DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING AN EXTRA.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:22.124
IS IT 40% OR SIXTY PERCENT. OF

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.825
THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:27.429
SPECIAL EDUCATION ANYWAY SO.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:28.964
OUR OUR AREN'T THEY GOING TO

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.532
HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY ANYWAY

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.668
AND- CAN I MAKING SENSE SO I

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.871
JUST GIVE THEM AN EXTRA. FIFTY

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.939
DOLLARS A ON IF IT'S DONE ON AN

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.941
EIGHTY A BASIS OR A STUN ON AN

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.043
EIGHTY A BASIS EIGHTY EIGHT. IN

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.212
TERMS OF MODERATE TO SEVERELY

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.113
DISABLED STUDENT IF WE CAN

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.415
FIGURE THAT OUT SO IS MY

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.251
QUESTION MAKE SENSE HOW DOES IT

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.952
REALLY MAKES HOW DOES THAT.

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.788
CONCERN MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.790
ENVIRONMENT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:56.858
WHERE IT'S NOT A 100% FUNDED

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.460
ANYWAY. SURE CITING THE

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:01.163
QUESTION THEN IS HOW YOU OUT

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:02.464
HOW YOU ALLOCATE THAT MONEY

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.332
RIGHT SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.768
HAVE. MORE MONEY THAT IS GOING

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.371
TO BE PROVIDED FOR A STUDENT

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.873
WITH FOR INSTANCE AUTISM. AND

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.875
YOU MADE IT IT MIGHT YOU MIGHT

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:14.943
AND SEE ADDITIONAL MONEY COMING

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.378
FROM THE STATE IF YOU HAVE

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:17.379
EIGHT CHILD'S THAT IS

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:18.847
CLASSIFIED IT WITH AN AUTISM.

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.116
ON DISABILITY THE QUESTION THEN

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.051
BECOMES WALL FROM A FISCAL

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.452
PERSPECTIVE DEAL YOU THINK THAT

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.154
THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL A

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.023
DIAGNOSTIC DIE DIAGNOSES AND

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.324
IDENTIFICATION OF THESE RATE.

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:32.260
HAS THIS BUT THEN COME WITH

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:35.397
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO I THINK

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.499
IT IS THAT A BAD THING SO I

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:38.300
THINK THAT IS A REALLY GOOD

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.968
QUESTION TO ASK- BUT I WOULD

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.703
SAY FIRST THAT IN TERMS OF THE

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.771
RESEARCH THERE HAVE BEEN VERY

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.072
STUDIES LOOKING AT STATES AND

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.240
HOW WHEN THEY TRANSITION OVER

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.676
TO. A MODEL THAT IS WHAT WE

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.910
CALL CONSENSUS SPACE WHICH IS

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.111
WHAT AB SIXTY TWO IS IT DOESN'T

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.646
TIED NECESSARILY TO A DIRECT

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:52.814
MEASURE OF COSTA JUST OVERALL

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.183
STUDENT COUNTY HAVE. OVERLY

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.384
OVERLAY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:57.452
YES EXACTLY HEARINGS THE

01:20:57.519 --> 01:21:00.889
DISMANTLING ABC TO EXACTLY- I

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:03.091
AND ENERGY STANDING THERE AND-

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:05.927
BUT AND- SORRY WE DO SEE IT

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:06.995
FROM OTHER STATES THAT.

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.496
CHANGING THE FUNDING MECHANISM

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:10.966
DOES CHANGE BEHAVIOR I THINK IS

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.701
A QUITE A I WANT TO MENTION-

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:17.339
DISPERSED BUT SECOND AND- IT'S-

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.374
I BECAUSE THIS IS MORE OF AN

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:20.942
ART THAN A SCIENCE YES IT

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.178
DEFINITELY AS YOU SAY JOHN HAS

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.813
IS ARTISTIC AND AT A CERTAIN

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:27.816
LEVEL YEAH I HAVE TO TAKE WHAT

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:30.252
YOU SAY IS GOSPEL BECAUSE IT'S

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:32.387
ART AND SCIENCE AND WHO KNOWS

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.155
WHAT WE'RE MORE JOHN IS ON THE

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:37.425
SCALE AND YES EXACTLY AND SO WE

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.426
I THINK WE ARE JUST VERY

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.328
COGNIZANT THAT THOSE MIGHT BE

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.896
MORE PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHEN

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:42.897
THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE BEING

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.399
MADE THEN THEY OUGHT TO BE

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:44.966
BECAUSE THERE IS ADDITIONAL

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.368
MONEY TIED TO A CERTAIN

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.769
CLASSIFICATION. AND THAT IS OUR

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.838
MAJOR CONCERN WELL I DON'T WANT

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:50.972
TO BELABOR THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:52.407
SUPPOSED TO BE AN OVERVIEW BUT

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:53.408
I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.610
THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:56.978
THERE ARE SOME AMIDST THIS

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:59.981
MONKS DOES- PERHAPS MAYBE THAT

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.850
WANT TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:05.854
THIS ISSUE AS WE MEET ME MOVE

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.522
FORWARD. AND THISIF. IN THE

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.225
SPECIAL EDUCATION ARENA- I WILL

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.393
MENTION THAT THERE ARE THERE

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:12.861
ARE MECHANISMS THAT WE ARE

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.195
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT AN OFFICE

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.563
THAT WOULD KIND OF AVOID

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.765
DISINCENTIVE ISSUES.

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.166
POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT HIGH A

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.635
HIGH COST RISK POOLS AND WHERE

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:21.736
IT WORKS ALMOST LIKE AN

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.172
INSURANCE MECHANISM. AND THAT

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.140
THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE TO

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:26.174
SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT BEFORE IT

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:27.375
GETS QUALIFIES FOR PARTIAL

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.710
REIMBURSEMENT TO THIS FROM THE

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.078
STATE OR LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:32.447
PROXY MEASURES DO NOT DIRECTLY-

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.683
FOCUSING AND FUNDING BASED ON

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.418
STUDENTS WITH MILD OR SEVERE

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.819
DISABILITIES. LOOKING AT

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:39.754
SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF MORE

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:41.289
CHALLENGING THE GAME AND SO I

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.223
THINK THOSE ARE CONTINUE

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.326
CONVERSATIONS DO YOU DO YOU

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.694
PLAN ON. PUTTING SOMETHING OUT

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.529
THAT SORT OF DETAILS SOME OF

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:49.964
THESE OPTIONS FOR US. I AM I

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.199
THINK IT IS GIVEN THE TIME LINE

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.167
IT'S MOST LIKELY THROUGH

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.002
CONVERSATIONS WITH. YOUR OFFICE

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.805
HAS GOT TO BE SUFFICIENT- BUT I

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:58.506
LOOK FORWARD TO. IF YOU'RE

01:22:58.573 --> 01:22:59.874
HAVING THE PRODUCT OF THOSE

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.343
CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:01.776
FORWARD WITH THEIR

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.345
DELIBERATIONS HERE. THANK YOU

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:07.382
FOR YOUR INPUT. MA'AM KRISTIN I

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.516
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.852
EDUCATION- I THINK JUST A DOVE

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.253
TAIL ON THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.523
HAVING- WITH LA- IS THAT THAT

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.992
IT'S A IT'S ALSO AN AREA OF

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:21.029
INTEREST AROUND THIS IDEA OF

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.931
HOW KIDS ARE IDENTIFIED AND

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.499
WHAT CLASS OF WHAT CAN'T

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.734
DISABILITY CATEGORY THERE

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.602
IDENTIFIED UNDER BECAUSE NOT

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.404
ONLY DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.772
AROUND PERCEIVED FUNDING AN

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.374
ACTUAL FUNDING COSTS BUT ALSO

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.608
IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED OUTCOMES

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.477
AND SO IT'S AN AREA THAT WE'RE

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:37.479
LOOKING AT- AND THAT WE LOOK AT

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:38.980
AROUND DISPROPORTIONATELY WHEN

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:41.616
YOU HAVE. CERTAIN MINORITY

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.551
STUDENT WORKS- THAT ARE OVER

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.953
REPRESENTED IN DIFFERENT

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:47.188
DISABILITY TYPES SO THERE'S A

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.757
LOT OF- THERE'S A LOT

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:50.592
UNDERNEATH THIS I THINK THE

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:51.960
FUNDING STUDY- FROM WHAT I

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.061
UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT BEING

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.329
COMMISSIONED IS GOING TO BE

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:57.165
LOOKING AT- THESE HOW THESE

01:23:57.232 --> 01:24:00.301
PLAY OUT AND I THINK THE FOLKS

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.302
THAT ARE DOING THE STUDY OF

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:01.870
JUSTIN AND STUDY OF ANOTHER

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.372
STATE TO REALLY LOOK THOSE

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.175
FORMULATIONS AND TO TRY TO AND

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:07.809
ASK SOME OF THAT SO THAT WE CAN

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:08.309
HAVE PERMISSION TO HAVE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.344
CONVERSATIONS. SO REALLY

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.845
LOOKING FORWARD AS WELL BECAUSE

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:13.214
THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:14.883
CONVERSATION ABOUT. IN A SYSTEM

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:17.152
THAT IS BASED ON LABELS WHAT

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:18.286
WE'RE REALLY AFTER IS TO TRY TO

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:19.320
GET STUDENTS WHAT THEY NEED

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.389
WHEN THEY NEED IT AND THAT- THE

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.724
MORE LABELS WERE PUTTING ON

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.225
STUDENTS. THE LESS YOU HAVE

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:25.093
ACCESS TO THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.594
SEEING THAT ACROSS ALL OF OURS

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:28.363
SORT OF INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.365
EVEN CROSSED DEPARTMENTS WELL

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:31.766
WE DO A LOT OF STUDIES ARE YES

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.002
HE HAS AND- I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.937
WE- DO MUCH WITH THE STUDIES

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:39.574
THAT WE- COMMISSION. A WOULD BE

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.709
ONE THING TO ME IF ALL THE

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:43.178
PLACES ON THE CHESS BOARD WERE

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.446
FULL ON WERE SIMPLY MOVING

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.614
PIECES AROUND BUT WE ARE

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:47.849
WORKING WITH A CHESS BOARD IT'S

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.818
GOT HALF THE PIECES ON IT AND

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:50.885
DISTRICTS ARE HAVING TO TAKE

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:52.420
THIS MONEY OUT OF SOME PLACE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.889
AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M IN FAVOR

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:58.226
OF MOVING. FORWARD RATHER THAN

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:00.128
NECESSARILY WAITING FOR STUDIES

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:00.895
WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.430
PROFESSIONALS IN THE EDUCATION

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:03.665
ARENA AND YOU WOULD. I WOULD

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.166
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.201
PROFESSIONALS MAKE THE

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.469
DECISIONS THEY MAKE FOR THE

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:08.703
RIGHT REASONS AND NOT SIMPLY

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.505
TO. PUT A FEW MORE DOLLARS INTO

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:12.173
THE GENERAL FUND ACCOUNT TO DO

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.843
WITH WHATEVER. AND I'M I'M

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.544
LEARNING THAT YOU KNOW YOU.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.646
THERE ARE VARIATIONS AND

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.914
APPARENTLY NOT EVERYTHING IS

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.583
CERTAIN AND FIXED IN THE AREA

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.852
OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND- IN

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.386
THE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS IN

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:27.021
THE CATEGORIES AND HOW WE-

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.756
ALLOCATE MONEY BUT I THINK WE

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:30.124
NEED TO TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.993
AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:32.894
NEED TO TRY TO DRIVE MORE MONEY

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.197
DOWN. TO ADDRESS- I NEED SO

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.632
THAT WE IN THE DEBT THE

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:38.967
DISTRICT LEVEL AND IN THE

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:41.336
CLASSROOM WE TAKE CARE OF. US

TERMS OF THE COST OF THE- HIT.

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.253
THE GENERAL FUND FOR THESE

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.622
DISTRICTS. BUT THE MONEY. HAS

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:44.492
TO BE THERE FOR STUDENTS WHO

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.894
NEED THE SERVICES RIGHT SO

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.162
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE MONEY'S

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.764
THERE AND IT'S NOT A MONEY

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:53.134
FUNDING ISSUE. HOW DO WE

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.903
ACCOUNT FOR THE FOR A- FOR THE

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.338
DIFFERENCE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.739
LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:01.909
STATISTIC. AND HOW ARE WE TO

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.978
PORT AND HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:05.980
THE FAILURE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.816
PROGRESS BETWEEN FIFTEEN

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:12.253
SIXTEEN AND- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.989
IN THE PROFICIENCY AREA. THE

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.691
CENTER FOR QUESTION IT IS IT IS

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.326
A QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:20.194
QUESTION THAT ARE THAT THAT'S

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.429
SORT OF THE ALL HANDS ON DECK

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:24.065
APPROACH IS- FIRST WE HAVE TO

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.733
HAVE A- GREAT FIRST TEACHING

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.601
WITH YOU KNOW AND GIVE OUR

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:28.636
EDUCATORS THE KIND OF

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.304
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.039
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:35.343
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK. AND BUT

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:36.344
I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.512
IT'S HARD TO IT'S HARD TO ARGUE

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:40.047
THAT KIDS WITH DISABILITIES CAN

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.148
GET ACCESS TO THAT IF THEY'RE

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:42.950
NOT THERE. IF THEY'RE IN

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.286
SEPARATE SETTINGS- AND NOT WITH

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.253
THEIR GENERAL APPEARS BECAUSE

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.356
WHAT WE'RE MAPPING TO HEAR IS

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:49.590
EMPLOYMENT AND COMMUNITY

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:50.758
INCLUSION BELONGING FOR EVERY

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:52.326
SINGLE STUDENT OUR STATE AND

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.427
WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.528
DIFFERENCE FOR AND FOR NOT

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:56.597
MAINSTREAMING AS OPPOSED. SOBRE

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.433
DAY SO EACH OF THOSE. EACH OF

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.168
THE EACH OF THIS IS A

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:02.003
COMPILATION OF INDIVIDUAL

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:03.904
STUDENT. YOU KNOW EDUCATION

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:06.073
PROGRAMS RIGHT SO THIS IS THE

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.641
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ENTITLEMENT.

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.744
SO EVERY THE PERFORMANCE ISSUE

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.879
SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THEBOWELS OF

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:13.681
THE DEATH OF THE DISTRICTS

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:14.615
INVOLVED. AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.650
AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCE. I

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:18.285
THINK IT'S BOTH I THINK IT'S A

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.488
COMBINATION OF THINGS RIGHT SO

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:23.424
IF YOU IF OUR STUDENTS. FIRST

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:24.859
OF ALL NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.394
GENERAL AND- THEN THAT'S GONNA

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.463
THAT TAKES A LEVEL OF SUPPORT.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:30.264
FOR THE TEACHER IN THE

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:33.768
CLASSROOM- IT ALSO IT TOUCHES

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.603
ON SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ALL

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.405
THE WAY FROM TRAINING AND SO

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:38.706
YOU KNOW WE CAN PUT WE CAN PULL

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:41.742
OUT THE IDEA AROUND- SPECIAL A

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.045
TEACHER SHORTAGE. AND HAVING A

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:46.514
SEASON TEACHER- ASSIGNED TO

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.848
EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS RIGHT WE

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.750
MAY HAVE. TEACHERS IN THEIR

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:51.685
FIRST YEAR OR TEACHERS ON SO

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:52.553
THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY IT'S

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.854
JUST THEY'RE NOT RIGHT IT WILL

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.056
TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THE TOOLS

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:56.357
THE MOST AFFECTED. SO THE

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:57.491
QUESTION IS AND THIS IS WHAT WE

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.325
GRAPPLE WITH ALL THE TIME IS

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.994
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUILD UP

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.262
CAPACITY IN THE STATE I THINK

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.397
IT CAME UP EARLIER AROUND THE-

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:05.466
THE CONTRACTING IN THAT. YOU

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:05.933
ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.001
CONTRACTING. WE DO HAVE TO

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.803
BUILD THAT CAPACITY IN OUR

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.504
SCHOOLS FOR THEM WE THEY NEED

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:13.340
ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:15.376
SUSTAIN. A SO THAT THEY DON'T

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.444
HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT BECAUSE

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:17.678
THE REALITY IS THEY HAVE TO

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.046
PROVIDE THE SERVICE ANYWAY.

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.581
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S AN

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.249
INDIVIDUAL ENTITLEMENT BE SUED.

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:23.117
THE SPENDING THE MONEY THE

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:24.085
QUESTION IS ARE THEY SPENDING

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.352
THE MONEY IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:26.854
WAY I GUESS AND AS OF ARE YOU

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.122
RIGHT AND SO WE WANT THEM TO

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:29.323
GET IN THE CYCLE WHERE THEY'RE

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:30.558
BUILDING THEIR OWN DISTRICT

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:31.425
CAPACITY THAT'S A LOT OF THE

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:34.195
WORK THE CARLA AS TO- AROUND.

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:36.430
BEING ABLE TO HAVE THOSE KINDS

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:38.432
OF ONE WELL SUPPORTED

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.367
CLASSROOMS AND WELL SUPPORTED

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:41.869
ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE HIGHLY

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.604
TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.239
THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.607
TEACHERS TO DO THEIR BEST WORK

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.442
AND FOR. AND SO PART OF THIS IS

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.177
IT'S A MINDSET AND MENTAL MODEL

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.480
PROBLEM THAT WE'VE CLASSICALLY

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:53.781
HAD STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:56.250
EXCLUDED. SO PART OF THIS IS.

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.119
YOU KNOW. AN ACCEPTANCE WHERE

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.954
WE WANT TO INCLUDE STUDENTS

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.921
WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE IT'S

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.890
THERE YOU KNOW IT'S THEIR RIGHT

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:05.326
AS PEOPLE TO BE INCLUDED. AND

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.627
WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRACKS

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.462
DIRECTLY IF YOU START OFF IN AN%

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.164
AS IN A SEGREGATED BETTING IN

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.732
PRESCHOOL YOU TYPICALLY END IN

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:12.733
THE SEGREGATED SETTING IN

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.068
SCHOOL OFTEN DON'T RECEIVE HER

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.569
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. SO FOR

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.938
BACKWARD MAPPING FROM WHAT WE

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:19.940
WANT FOR OUR STUDENTS WERE WE

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.509
WANT THEM TO START FROM THE

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:22.443
BEGINNING TO KNOW THAT THEY

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.845
BELONG AND THEN TO BUILD IN ALL

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.413
THOSE LEVELS OF SUPPORT THE FOR

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.548
SOME STUDENTS THAT'S A LOT OF

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.983
SUPPORT. YOU KNOW FOR MY

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:31.519
DAUGHTER THAT MAY MEAN. SHE

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:32.119
NEEDS FULL TIME. WORKING ALL

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.521
THE TIME TO INCLUDE HER IN THAT

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.022
CLASSROOM MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:36.957
ONE PERSON. BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.792
THE MORE SIGNIFICANT END OF THE

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:40.728
SPECTRUM AND WE GET THERE. SO

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:41.962
IT MAY NOT IS THIS HOW DOES

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.765
THIS SURE HOW DOES THIS. THAT

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.934
IS HOW DO WE GET THERE BECAUSE

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.269
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.037
INCREASED FUNDING- IN

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:52.673
PARTICULAR AREAS. RELIEVING IN

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.175
THEIR SPENDING THIS THE BOTTOM

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.409
OF THEIR PRESUMABLY SPENDING

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.244
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY NEED

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.846
TO SPEND OR THEY WOULD BE SUED.

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:00.714
ON SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE IS

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.683
A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO AND YOU

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.251
KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:06.053
PROBABLY IN LITIGATION SOME

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:09.290
DISTRICT BUNCH OF. AND WE CAN

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.559
REARRANGE THE MONEY TO TRY TO

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.294
GET IT TO THE HIGH COST AREAS

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.863
AND SHOULD. BUT WITHIN THAT

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:19.033
ENVIRONMENT WHATEVER THE MONEY

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:21.535
IS HOPEFULLY IT'S ENOUGH HOW DO

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:24.605
WE IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. AT THE

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.007
SCHOOL LEVEL. WHAT'S THE

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:29.677
PROCESS TO DO THAT. I MEAN DO

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:31.745
WE SEND OUT TEAMS OF INSPECTORS

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:33.647
AND SAY TO THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:37.117
AND THE PRINCIPLE. NO NO NO HI

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.552
SO HOW DO WE DO IT IF AND

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.087
FRANKLY JUST GIVE UP I DON'T

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:41.722
MEAN TO NO I THINK THE I THE

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:43.057
RIGHT CUT IS THAT IS THAT IT

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:44.525
BUT IT IS A COMBINATION OF MANY

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.492
ISSUES AND ONE OF THEM IS A

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:46.627
FUNDING ISSUE AND SO FOR IF WE

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.495
WANT THE IF WE WANT TO.

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:49.096
DISTRICTS BE ABLE TO BUILD UP

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:52.132
ALL THEIR- FUNDAMENTAL HERE ONE

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.068
BEST FIRST INSTRUCTION AND THE

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.070
MANDATE IS ON MAKING SURE TO

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.171
PROVIDE ALL THE RELATED

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:58.239
SERVICES IN THERE AND THERE'S

01:37:58.305 --> 01:38:00.107
NOT ENOUGH MONEY THERE THAN

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:02.776
THAT. MANDATE IT COMES TO THE

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.445
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOR

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:05.546
THOSE SERVICES BECAUSE THAT IS

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:06.981
SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED AND

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:07.881
YOU'RE RIGHT THEY WILL BE

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.650
LITIGATED BUT I THINK CARL CAN

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:10.985
SPEAK TO. MAKE IT TO THE

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:11.885
FUNDING ISSUE BECAUSE I'M SO

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:14.421
FASCINATED BY IT SO EVEN IF WE

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.957
PROVIDE AN OVERLAY TO THE V.

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.159
SIX A TWO FOUR FORMULA FOR THE

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:20.794
MODERN SEVERELY DISABLED.

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:23.230
STUDENTS IN WEEKS HELLO THAT

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:24.865
DOWN THE PIPELINE TO THE

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:28.369
SUBURBS IN THE ALLEYS. IT COSTS

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.571
MUCH ANYWAY THE DEAD RELEASE

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:31.605
PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:33.440
RIGHT. SO THEY ARE GETTING MORE

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.942
MONEY FROM US PRESUMABLY THEY

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:36.110
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE AS MUCH OF

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:38.245
THE GENERAL FUND. TO COVER THE

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:40.214
COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION IN

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:42.283
THE DISTRICTS. ARE WE ASSUMING

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:43.851
THAT THEY'RE GONNA. TAKE THE

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:45.853
MONEY THAT WE HAVE. THE

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:46.954
OBLIGATION THAT WE HAVE

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.589
SOMEWHAT RELIEVED THEM FROM IN

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.691
TERMS OF THERE'S GENERAL FUND.

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:51.625
AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:53.127
GENERAL FUND MONEY MOVING

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:55.129
TOWARDS SPECIAL ED. I THINK

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.230
WE'RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:57.364
THOUGH THAT THE FOUNDATION

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.966
AROUND UNIVERSAL EDUCATION FOR

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.668
ALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA FOR

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:01.735
EXAMPLE YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:02.703
NOT JUST STUDENTS WITH

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:03.837
DISABILITIES BUTTRESSING OVER

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:05.272
ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:07.675
STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN LA AND

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:09.877
MATHEMATICS ARE AREAS THAT WE

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:10.611
HAVE GREAT IMPROVEMENT THAT

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.446
NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO I DO THINK

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.014
THINK ABOUT HOW WE FIND JUST

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:15.282
ENSURING THAT THE GOOD FIRST

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.584
TEACHING. IS OCCURRING IN EVERY

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:18.786
CLASSROOM IN THE STATE OF

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:19.953
CALIFORNIA IS SOMETHING THAT

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.188
AROUND PER PEOPLE FUNDING WE'RE

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.923
GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.024
WOULD THAT TAKE WHAT IS THAT

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:27.561
LOOK LIKE- BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:30.564
LOOK AT SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.298
FUNDING AND SERVICES. OKAY THEN

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:35.636
WHAT THESE. SELECT FOR OUR

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:36.970
STUDENTS WITH. HOW DO YOU IT

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:39.106
WAS THAT HOW IN SAN. THAT

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.674
WITHIN THE SUBURB WITHIN THE

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.776
ELLIE A FOR EXAMPLE. IN MY

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:44.244
EXPERIENCE ARE FINDING AS WE

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.579
WORK AND PROVIDING DIRECT

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:47.514
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AS THE

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.116
AS THE DISTRICT- AND PLAY FOR A

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:50.684
LONG TIME. WHAT I'M FINDING IS

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.453
THAT FOLKS IN MANY SITUATIONS

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.154
DO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.723
HAPPEN. I THINK THERE'S A

01:39:55.789 --> 01:39:56.557
COUPLE AREAS WHERE THE

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:59.526
STRUGGLES BEGAN WINDING IS HOW

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:02.196
DO YOU BEGIN TO BUILD A

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:04.264
CONSENSUS ABOUT LOCAL LEVEL ON

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:05.899
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO WHEN WE

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.101
TALK ABOUT EDUCATING ALL KIDS.

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:08.969
EACH COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN VIEW

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:10.637
AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.473
HOW DO YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE TO

01:40:12.539 --> 01:40:13.707
CREATE GOOD STRONG PLANS OF

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:14.975
ACTIONS WITH SOME BENCHMARKS.

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.510
KNOWING THAT THAT WORKS WILL

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:17.644
NOT WORKING AND BEING ABLE TO

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.346
COURSE CORRECT IT'S SOMETHING

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:20.147
THAT DISTRICTS ARE STILL TRYING

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:21.181
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:22.783
TO DO. THE NEXT PIECE THOUGH

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.085
AND THE REPORTING OUT TO

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:27.121
PUBLIC. BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.155
CAP FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT WE KNOW

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:28.922
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.257
SHOULD BE REALLY DRIVING THE

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:31.492
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITHIN

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:32.659
THE DISTRICT. BUT DISTRICTS

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:34.361
STILL ARE REALLY TRYING TO BE

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:35.729
REFLECTIVE OF HOW TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.197
DO THAT JURY STILL OUT ON

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:38.499
WHETHER THAT WORKS OR IS THIS

01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:39.466
PART OF THE DASHBOARD FOR

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:40.901
EXAMPLE I MEAN YOU CAN BEING

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.136
RESPONSIVE TO THE DASHBOARD

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.670
DATA IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.005
THAT. BUT IN THIS AREA SO YEAH

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:47.541
HE'LL ACTUALLY 57% OF OUR

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:49.543
DISTRICTS THAT ARE- QUALIFY FOR

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.378
DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE.

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:53.080
UNDER THE DASHBOARD FOR THEIR

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:54.481
WHAT THEIR DATA IS TELLING US

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:55.682
IS FOR THE STUDENTS WITH

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:58.118
DISABILITIES. GROUP SO THAT'S

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:58.652
WHY I'M SAYING IT IS THIS

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.020
THERE'S ALL NAMES ON. EFFORT

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.455
THERE IS A DEEP CONNECTION

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:02.556
BETWEEN THAT GOOD FIRST

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:03.857
INSTRUCTION AND THEN WHAT

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.559
HAPPENS. AFTER BECAUSE

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:07.194
TECHNICALLY EVERY STUDENT AS A

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:08.562
GENERAL AT STUDENT THERE'S NOT

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:09.563
SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IN GENERAL

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:10.831
ITS STUDENTS THEIR STUDENTS

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.800
THAT ARE THEIR STUDENTS THEN

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:13.600
THEIR STUDENTS WHO ALSO RECEIVE

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.436
SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SO WE

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:16.937
THAT'S THE PIECE THAT WERE

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:18.939
REALLY TRYING TO. MEMORIALIZE

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:21.542
OF YELLOW I WAS THE SECOND

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:22.075
PIECE OF THAT IS ALSO THE

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.710
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS TO WELL TO

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:25.779
SUPPORT ON THE GROUND. SO IN

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:28.248
THE CLASSROOM THE STUDENTS YEAR

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:29.483
EVERY YEAR EVERY DAY THEIR

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.418
CONSTANT. IN THE SYSTEM IT'S A

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:33.554
NEAT. GILLES BILL TO PRESS.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.389
CONTEMPLATING SO THE TYPES OF

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:40.961
THE ARTS AVAIL OKAY. AT FROM.

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:41.695
THE CLOSEST SINCE STATE WHY

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:42.963
TECHNO SYSTEMS ALSO A LOCAL LAW.

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.597
IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NEEDS BE

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:44.965
ABLE TO GROW AND CHANGE BECAUSE

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:45.699
THAT KIND OF COACHING AND

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.634
IMPLEMENTATION. IS REALLY WHAT

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.169
DRIVES THE CHANGE IT'S WHAT

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:50.671
TEACHERS AND FEEL LIKE I HAVE

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.172
THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS I CAN

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.974
DO THIS WHAT ARE THE SUPPORT

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.108
SENATE DISTRICT NEEDS TO BE

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:56.677
AWARE OF IN UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:58.378
SHIFTING NEEDS NEED ALSO THEM

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.247
TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT. THOSE KIND

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.582
THAT KIND OF SUPPORT TO KNOW

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.217
HOW TO DO THAT. IS NOT AN EASY

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:04.585
THING TO BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:05.819
SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:06.954
SUPPORT. I THINK ONE OF THINGS

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.622
I SEE IT ON IS AROUND LIKE

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:09.189
CREEK BEING ABLE TO CREATE

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.657
CONTINUUM'S OF SUPPORT THROUGH

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:13.627
MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS- BEHAVIOR

01:42:13.694 --> 01:42:14.962
IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS SOCIAL

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:16.497
EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:17.998
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:19.600
CULTURE AND CLIMATE AT A SCHOOL

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:21.068
THAT REALLY FEELS WELCOMING AND

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.469
SAFE. AND AT THE SAME TIME BE

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:23.770
ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:25.072
INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT FOR

01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:26.707
CERTAIN STUDENTS AND FAMILIES.

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:28.008
HOW DOES ONE SCHOOL BE ABLE TO

01:42:28.075 --> 01:42:29.176
OFFER THAT HOW DOES ONE

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.278
DISTRICT BILL THAT- THIS IS WHY

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.679
SOMETIMES I'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.481
COSTS. AROUND THESE KINDS OF

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:36.216
CONTINUUM'S OF SUPPORT. OF

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:38.385
BECOME QUIT THEIR PRIMARY BIG

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:39.586
IN THE REASON WHY THE PEOPLE

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:40.921
REALLY FEELING IT AT THE

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:41.922
DISTRICT LEVEL IS BECAUSE-

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.423
BEING ABLE TO BUILD THAT KIND

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.192
OF CONTINUING CANNOT JUST BE ON

01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:46.627
ONE END OF. INDIVIDUALIZED

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.161
SUPPORT IT ALSO HAS TO BE

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:50.731
PROACTIVE IT ALSO HAS TO BE FOR

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:51.331
THE MANY KIDS WALKING TO THE

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:52.299
GATE OF THE SCHOOL THAT THEY'RE

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:53.967
FEELING THAT. TEACHERS YOU KNOW

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:56.703
AND THEN- SUPPORT STAFF AS WELL

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:57.804
AS PRINCIPLES ARE ABLE TO

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.239
REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.874
THAT THESE KIDS ARE READY TO GO

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.376
FROM THE MINUTE THEY WALK INTO

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:03.544
THE SCHOOL AND- REALLY MOVE

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.445
OUTSIDE THE- THIS. I WILL HAVE

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.381
BEEN FOCUSED ON TODAY WHICH IS

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:11.285
THE SILO AND AT LEAST IN PART.

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.653
THE SILO INVOLVING SOCIAL

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:15.022
CATION FUNDING YOU MOVE INTO.

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:16.757
FOR AND GENERALLY. A LIST THE

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:19.793
CASE TWELVE EDUCATE WHETHER.

FIVE SUN THE YOU LOOK AT THE-

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:28.602
IF THE SECOND. GROW OF THE

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:30.671
SECOND GRAPH. REALLY WHAT

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:31.872
THAT'S US IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:32.973
TO ABOUT WHICH IS R. C. WITH

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:33.674
DISABILITIES ARE NOT JUST USE

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.309
WHICH IS A FOR THEY EARNED

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.877
DOLLARS AS GENERAL AS STUDENTS

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:38.512
RIGHT WE'RE NOT JUST- SAYING

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:39.680
THERE SOON WITH THIS BUILDING

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.114
AND CHARGING EVERYTHING AGAIN

01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:42.616
SPECIAL ED RIGHT. GET THAT THEY

REALLY ARE ENTITLED TO THOSE

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.053
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A HIGHER

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:47.354
NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS WITH

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:48.956
DISABILITIES REPRESENTED IN OUR

RECEIVE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:58.699
MEALS. SO OVERALL MORE 70% OF

01:43:58.765 --> 01:43:59.833
OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.435

LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.972
STUDENT GROUPS AS WELL. MEANING

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.907
THAT THIS IS ALL SO

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:07.774
INTERCONNECTED AND IT'S NOT

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.643
JUST ABOUT GETTING SPECIAL

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:12.212
LOWER YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT AN

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.947
ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT ABOUT.

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:16.249
WHAT WE BELIEVE IN KIDS- THAT

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:18.719
IT'S EACH AND EVERY KID AND

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:20.053
THAT WERE REALLY THE- DISTRICT

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.489
THAT WERE WORKING WITH THAT

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:23.457
WE'VE SEEN. SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:25.158
OVER TIME- WITH GENERATION

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:26.393
RATES FOR STUDENTS WITH

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.327
DISABILITIES AND OTHER THINGS

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:28.462
ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:30.497
INTENTIONALLY BACKWARD MAPPED.

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:32.232
TO PRESCHOOL. AND STARTED WITH

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:34.267
A SHIFT IN MINDSET AND MENTAL

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:35.802
MODELS ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:37.571
ABOUT ALL KIDS. AND THAT

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.473
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:41.808
NOT. KIDS WHO CAN'T LEARN SINCE

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:42.676
THE DISABILITIES ARE KIDS WITH

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:43.944
UNIQUE LEARNING NEEDS THAT YOU

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.812
KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT. THE

01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:47.848
SYSTEM AND SO PART OF THAT IT

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:49.316
INTO CARLOS WHEN IT'S WE'RE

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:51.118
JUST WE'RE JUST. SEEING THAT WE

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.085
NEED TO PROVIDE A LOT OF

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:53.920
SUPPORT AND SO ALL THESE

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:54.454
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE

IT'S JUST LIKE REALLY

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.695
COMPLICATED PUZZLE. THAT WE ARE

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:02.996
STARTING TO I THINK IT HAS THE

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.131
MOMENTUM ON BUT WE NEED TO

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.266

OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.434
SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS. LEDS

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.536
DO WANT AND BUT THEY ALSO NEED

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.838
EVEN DEEPER THEY WANT TO BE

YOU WE CAN SEE AS A LAY ALSO

01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:56.550
BEGIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:58.018
BUILDING THAT CAPACITY FROM THE

01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:59.920
ROOTS UP. AS WERE ALSO BUILDING

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:02.155
THAT TYPE OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS

THAT FOLKS ARE JUST GONNA NEED

01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:08.729
AS THEY TRY TO IMPLEMENT THEM.

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:11.798
I'M IMPORTANT BUT A VERY

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:12.566
COURAGEOUS WORK THAT THE TAP.

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:17.671
IS A BRAND TING IN THE SHIP IN.

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:21.408

CONCENTRATION GRANT DOLLARS ARE

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.112
READ THE STEW IN THIS THAT OF

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:25.779
THE GREATER NADER THEY'RE

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:27.547
SIMPLE ELSE AND THE HOLY ABOUT

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:28.849
THIS BETWEEN SCHOOL A IN SCHOOL

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:31.084
AND BECAUSE THEY PREDICT DOES

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:34.788
HAS YOU KNOW. THE 55% OVER 55%

01:46:34.855 --> 01:46:36.223
ANSWERED CENTERS SO VERY

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:37.624
INTERESTING AND YOU DON'T KNOW

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:40.060
HOW OFTEN. YOU'RE ALWAYS THINK

01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:41.161
ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:43.196
JUST TALKING ABOUT SPECIAL

01:46:43.263 --> 01:46:45.298
EDUCATION DOLLARS. SENDING

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:47.334
THOSE DOWN A PIPELINE IT'S ALL

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.302
OF THE OTHER EDUCATION DOLLARS

01:46:49.369 --> 01:46:50.904
THAT FLOW TO A PARTICULAR

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.306
SCHOOL CAMPUS. AND WHETHER

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:54.875
THOSE ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:56.943
SERVICES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:58.845
THE EDUCATION OF A STUDENT WITH

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.280
SPECIAL NEEDS BUT ARE NOT

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.549
DIRECTLY RELATED- IN THE WAYS

01:47:02.616 --> 01:47:04.351
THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT

01:47:04.417 --> 01:47:06.520
AROUND. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY-

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.455
CONVICTING A WORKER RIGHT NOW

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:10.991
FROM THE BUDGET FROM SB SEVENTY

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.259
FIVE FROM WHAT. LAST BUDGET

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:16.329
CYCLE OF AROUND. FAQ TO- MEDI

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.031
CAL DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL BASED

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:20.400
HEALTH. AND ABSENCE IS ALSO A

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:21.735
BIG PART OF THAT CONVERSATION

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:22.602
BECAUSE THE STUDENTS THAT

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:23.537
YOU'RE SEEING IN THOSE GRAPHS

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:25.672
ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT WE CAN

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:27.107
DRAW DOWN DOLLARS FOR THE

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.608
SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE.

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:30.043
PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY AS WELL

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:31.812
BY THE WAY YES. SO THIS ALL

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:32.979
THIS IS SUCH AN INTERCONNECTED

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:34.948
CONVERSATION AND WHAT WERE

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:36.883
SENSING AND WE'RE BEEN PART OF

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:38.185
A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

HOW DO WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:42.255

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.199
OF WORK THAT WE HAVE FOUND TO

01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:52.866
BE REALLY HELPFUL SUCH AS

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:54.267
WORKING WITH DISTRICTS AND IT'S

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:55.202

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:01.474
ABLE TO DO THIS WORK. HAVE BEEN

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:02.008
THINGS LIKE THAT THE PARTY

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.310
INCLUDES OF PRACTICES WERE AND

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.312
I WANT TO THANK THE CD E. FOR

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:05.846
MAKING THEMSELVES ALWAYS

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.647
AVAILABLE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.082
BEST WAY TO REALLY EDUCATE OUR

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:10.250
STUDENTS WITH THIS PLACE TO SEE

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.418
THE OUTCOMES WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:12.786
OUR THROUGH INCLUSIONARY

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:14.721
PRACTICES. BUT IT'S NOT

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:15.822
SOMETHING THAT'S SO EASY TO

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:18.091
JUST BE ABLE TO TURN KIßM

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.427
MAKE HAPPEN. AND SO BEING ABLE

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:21.661
TO HAVE FOLKS LIKE TEAM INCOME

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:23.029
AT ALL AND WERE. THE DISK IN

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:24.097
THE SCHOOL. IT ANOTHER PER

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:25.866
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE FOLK THAT'S

01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:27.000
THE KIND OF SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:28.501
LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO ALSO SEE.

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:30.904
FROM THE STATE. BUT HOW DO WE-

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:33.173
MAYBE YOU MENTIONED THE SENATE.

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.341
BECAUSE I MOLD IT FLEW OVER MY

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:38.144
HEAD BUT- HOW DO YOU. HOW DO WE

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:43.183
THE DATA. THE BILL THAT. IN A-

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:47.153
GOOD WAY ABOUT THE NUNS ED.

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.823
IMPACT ON THE EDUCATION OF

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:52.292
THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ON THE

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:53.894
SCHOOL CAMPUS IS THAT A FAIR

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.996
QUESTION IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:58.498
DO THINK ES WHAT IS I MEAN THIS

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:00.400
IS REGARDING THAT I MEAN IT'S A

01:49:00.467 --> 01:49:03.136
RATHER GENERALIZED APPROACH. TO

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:04.137
AND I THINK THE THING THAT WILL

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:05.538
BE TRICKY THINGS IT'S A GOOD

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:06.740
QUESTION I THINK WHAT'S TRICKY

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:07.874
IS ALWAYS EACH PLACE IS SO

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:09.910
DIFFERENT AND TRIES TO DEFINE

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:11.811
THEIR PROGRAMMING IF I WAS JUST

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:12.345
AT A DISTRICT THAT WAS THE

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.580
FINING. TEACHING IN ONE WAY

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.649
WHEN ACTUALLY AS THE RESEARCH

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.783
AND OTHERS WOULD DEFINE IT IS

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.518
NOT NECESSARY PERFECTLY ALIGNED

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.654
AND SO WHERE WHERE DO YOU START

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.489
TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT HOW

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:24.124
PEOPLE DESCRIBE CERTAIN

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:25.825
PROGRAMMING OR FRAMEWORKS

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:27.260
THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING. MAKING

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.397
SURE THAT THERE ARE- BEING

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:32.032
DESCRIBED IN THE SAME WAY SO

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:32.933
YOU CAN MEASURE WHETHER

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:34.100
SOMETHING IS ON THE ALLEGED

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:35.535
CATION SIDE OF MAKING SURE ALL

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:36.937
KIDS HAVE ACCESS IS THIS IDEA

01:49:37.003 --> 01:49:39.306
OF. UNIVERSAL EDUCATION FOR ALL

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.707
OF VERSES THOSE THINGS THAT

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:42.175
REALLY SHOULD BE UNIQUE AND

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:44.911
SPECIALIZED TWOS YES WITH

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:46.880
SPECIAL NEEDS SO WHAT'S SPECIAL

ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION. RIGHT

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:50.917
ABOUT COORDINATING THEY CARE

THE WE HAVE A LOT OF ENTITIES

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.221
EVEN AMONGST THOSE STUDENT

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.890
GROUPS THAT YOU SAW THE OVERLAP

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:58.224
IN WE'RE DOING AND THAT

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.159
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK

AROUND FOSTER YOUTH AND THE A

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:03.463
CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. SO

TIME ISSUE FOR MEASUREMENT IS

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.436
USUALLY VERY SPECIFIC IN TIME

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.937
LIKE YOU HAVE FOUR YEARS TO DO

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:19.205
