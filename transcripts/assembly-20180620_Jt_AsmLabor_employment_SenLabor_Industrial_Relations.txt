TO WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY LABOR COMMITTEE AND ALSO JOINT -- HEARING OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF LABOR COMMITTEES I'M HONORED. THAT MY COLLEAGUE HERE THE CHAIR OF SENATE LABOR AND TODAY WILL HAVE A SPECIAL HEARING. ON A MATTER THAT WILL BE BEFORE THE BALLOT BEFORE WE BEGIN. I'D LIKE TO OFFER OUR MY CO CHAIR AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS. THANK YOU. GREAT TO BE HERE AND LET'S GET THE BALL ROLLING ASSIDUOUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ALWAYS -- ON TOP OF IT AND LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT -- BILL SAID OTHERS CALL OUR FIRST WITNESS TODAY -- THIS IS -- A HEARING -- FOCUSED ON ISSUES RELATED -- TO AMBULANCE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR BREAKS -- WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE LEOS OFFICE. CHAS ALAMO WHO IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW. OF THE INITIATIVE AS PROPOSED WELL WELCOME AND WE ARE READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER MISTERS CHAIRS -- I'M JAZZ ALMA WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- AS WAS SAID WE RATS TO PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS INITIATIVE. ARM AND AND WE COULD PUT TOGETHER A HANDOUT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU THAT THAT THIS TESTIMONY WILL BE WORKING OFF OF BEFORE GETTING INTO THE HAND OUT SPECIFICALLY STE A BIT. OUR OFFICE HAS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO INITIATIVES -- IT'S UNLIKE ARE SORT OF POLICY AND BUDGET ROLE WHERE WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE LIKE I'M WITH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS WERE TASKED MORE IS AN IMPARTIAL THIRD PARTY. WE REVIEW THE INITIATIVE ASSESS WHAT IT'S FISCAL AFFECT WOULD BE FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT DON'T MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OR PINE ON THE MERITS OF THE INITIATIVES -- SO IF WE TURN TO PAGE ONE WITH THAT CONTEXT IN MIND. OUR ROLE AS AN OFFICE IS. TO EVALUATE EVERY INITIATIVE THAT SUBMITTED OUR ALONGSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT EVALUATION -- GOES ALONG WITH THE PETITIONS THAT HOG GO OUT BEFORE REGISTERED VOTERS DURING THE SIGNATURE GATHERING PROCESS MONTHS INTO AN INITIATIVE HAS GATHERED ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY. FOR FOR THE BALLOT ARE OFFICE AGAIN REVIEWS AND INITIATIVE PROVIDES A BACKGROUND -- EVALUATES WHAT THE INITIATIVE DOES AND ASSESSES ITS FISCAL IMPACTS ON WERE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT RIGHT NOW FOR THIS INITIATIVE FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT -- TURNING TO PAGE TWO THIS HANDOUT BEGINS WITH THE BACKGROUND SECTION. DESCRIBES THE PROPOSAL ITSELF AND DISCUSSES THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF MEASURE ON AS YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA. OUR AMBULANCES ARE DISPATCHED TO LOCATION OF A NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY CALL TYPICALLY AN AMBULANCE HAS A TWO PERSON CREW WITH AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN OR EMT AND A PARAMEDIC. THEY PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THEN TRANSPORT THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL -- IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION ARE PROVIDED BY FOR PROFIT AMBULANCE COMPANIES ON THE REMAINING QUARTER TYPICALLY IS AN AMBULANCE IT'S OPERATED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY -- AND TO ENSURE THAT AMBULANCE TRANSPORTATION IS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE COUNTIES COORDINATE THE SYSTEMS OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. IN A COORDINATED SYSTEM BY CENTRALLY IN THEIR IN THEIR COUNTY REGION SEPARATING THE COUNTY INTO ZONES AND IN EACH ZONE THE COUNTY. THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS SELECTS A PRIMARY AMBULANCE COMPANY PRIMARY AMBULANCE PROVIDER TO SERVE THAT AREA. AND THIS IS SORT OF A A CONTRACTUAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE AMBULANCE PROVIDER. ARE ON THE ONE HAND THE COUNTY KNOWS THAT AMBULANCE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THAT REGION. AND IT ALSO ENSURES THAT MOST AND HARD SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITH IN AT A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT SO THERE'S THERE'S A TIME REQUIREMENT ON ON NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE THE AMBULANCE HAS TO GET TO THIS TEAM'S TYPICALLY WITHIN. EIGHT TO TWELVE MINUTES AN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CONTRACTUAL CHANGE FOR THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS THIS SORT OF A GUARANTEED INSURER REVENUE STREAM BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE RESPONDING TO ALL THE CALLS ON HIS OWN. AND THEREFORE ROOM WILL RECEIVE -- BILLING CHARGES FOR ALL THOSE ALL THOSE TRANSPORTS ON IN MOST CASES EITHER GOVERNMENT PROVIDED OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PAYS FOR THE COST OF AMBULANCE TRIPS ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AMBULANCE TRIPS ARE FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICARE OR MEDICAID HOW. IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 20% ARE FOR PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE REST ARE FOR PATIENTS WITH WITH NO HEALTH INSURANCE WHATSOEVER -- TURNING TO PAGE. THREE DESCRIBE BRIEFLY SOME OF WHAT A TYPICAL AMBULANCE TRIP COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS ON AVERAGE PER TRIP -- MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW -- ARE BUILD A SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT THERE REIMBURSEMENT FOR AMULETS PROVIDERS IS LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE COST OF AN AMBULANCE TRIP IN THE STATE. SO TO MAKE UP FOR THESE LOSSES A PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES ACTUALLY BILL COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURERS MUCH MORE THAN THE AVERAGE COSTS ARM UP TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TRIP ON AVERAGE -- FOR FOR THESE SERVICES AND IN THIS WAY AMBULANCE PROVIDERS BALANCE OUT THERE THEIR PAYER MAX IN ORDER TO COVER THEIR COSTS. I'M TURNING TO THE TOP OF PAGE FOUR WILL GET INTO EMTS AND PARAMEDICS THEMSELVES AND THEIR RESTING MEAL BREAK STRUCTURES. THEY'RE ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EMTS AND PARAMEDICS CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THE STATE. AND MOST AMBULANCE CREWS ARE CONSIST OF ONE EMT AND ONE PARAMEDIC THEY TYPICALLY WORK TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS THOUGH IN SOME CASES THEY WORK TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFTS TOGETHER -- AND LIKE MOST OTHER EMPLOYEES -- AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO PRIDE BEYOND REST BREAKS TO THEIR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. BUT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE THE BUSINESS -- EMTS AND PARAMEDICS HAVE TRADITIONALLY REMAINED ON CALL DURING THEIR RESTING MEAL BREAKS SO THEY MIGHT GO AND TAKE A SCHEDULED MEAL BREAK. BUT THE NINE ONE ONE CALL COMES AND THEY'LL TAKE THAT CALL RESPOND TO THE CALL AND THEN TRY TO RESCHEDULE THEIR MEAL BREAK LATER. AND AS A RESULT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS TO SCHEDULE THEIR PRICKS PROFT INTERRUPTED AND SOMETIMES THEY WON'T RECEIVE THEIR THEIR MEAL BREAK DURING THEIR SHIFT. THOUGH IT AT THE SAME TIME MOST EMERGENCY AMBULANCE CREWS HAVE SUFFICIENT WORK SIGNIFICANT DOWNTIME DURING THEIR SHIFT THEY ARE THEY'RE POSTED AT THEIR LOCATION AND AND WAITING FOR A NINE ONE ONE CALL TO COME AND BUT MAYBE THERE'S AN HOUR TO IN BETWEEN CALLS. SO DURING THESE TIMES THESE PERIODS OF DOWNTIME CREWS CAN TYPICALLY TAKE A BREAK. EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MAYBE PRE SCHEDULED AND THAT IT COULD BE INTERRUPTED THEY DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT IT WON'T BE INTERRUPTED -- AND TURNING TO TO THE NEXT PAGE -- THIS LONGSTANDING INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF HAVING EMTS AND PARAMEDICS STAY ON CALL DURING BREAK -- COULD BE AFFECTED BY RECENT STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION I AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT ON CALL BREAKS OF THIS NATURE ACTUALLY VIOLATE STATE LABOR LAW. AND INSTEAD THE COURT FOUND THAT EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE OFF DUTY BREAKS THAT ARE UNINTERRUPTIBLE SO THE CASE WAS A JUSTICE V. AB AND SECURITY SERVICES. CHATTED WITH PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS THAT WERE REQUIRED AT THE TIME TO KEEP A WALKIE TALKIE ON THEM DURING THEIR BREAKS AND THE COURT FOUND THAT THIS ACTUALLY VIOLATED STATE LAW. AND IT DID DID NOT QUALIFY AS A BREAK BECAUSE THEY WERE ON CALL ON THE LABOR LAWS AND WAGE ORDERS THAT RELATE TO PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS ON THE A JUSTICE CASE ARE PRETTY SIMILAR. TO THOSE THAT APPLY TO EMTS AND PARAMEDICS AND AS A RESULT IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT THE THE DECISION AND THE AT JUSTICE CASE WHAT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. BE FOUND TO APPLY TO EMTS AND PARAMEDICS BY THE STATE'S COURTS -- SO MOVING TO THE NEXT SO THE PIECE OF BACKGROUND. ON PAGE. SIX WE HAVE TO ASSESS. WHAT THE LIKELY OUTCOME WOULD BE FOR THE CURRENT -- CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICE IF EMT AND PARAMEDICS ARE PROVIDED OFF DUTY BREAKS UNDER THIS EXHAUSTIVE DECISION AND WE SEE THAT THIS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE COSTS FOR PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES. ON BECAUSE IN ORDER TO BRING MEET MEET THE RESPONSE TIME REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THEIR CONTRACTS WITH COUNTIES -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO LIKELY AT AN ADDITIONAL AMBULANCE UNIT OR PERHAPS PERHAPS TO IN SOME AREAS SO THAT SOME COULD GO ON BREAKS ESSENTIALLY TURNING THEIR RADIOS OFF FOR THAT THIRTY MINUTE PERIOD. AND THEY WOULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL AMBULANCE IN THE AREA TO RESPOND TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL THAT WOULD COME DOWN -- STATEWIDE WE THINK THAT THESE NEW COSTS POTENTIALLY BE IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEW COSTS AMBULANCE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMAIN PROFITABLE COULD MAKE CERTAIN. COULD RESPOND IN IN A VARIETY OF WAYS ON WE GOT THEM LISTED HERE FIRST WE WE THINK THAT SOME AMBULANCE COMPANIES COULD NEGOTIATE. COMPROMISE AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR LABOR UNIONS ARE WHICH WOULD SUPERSEDE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A JUSTICE AND SORT OF BE A MIDDLE GROUND TO FULL COMPLIANCE AND THEREFORE. REDUCE SOME COSTS. SECONDLY AMBULANCE COMPANIES COULD ATTEMPT TO BILL COMMERCIAL INSURERS AT HIGHER AMOUNTS TO RECRUIT ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS. MON THIRD AMBULANCE COMPANIES COULD LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS SO FOR INSTANCE THEY COULD TRY DOING MORE CASES HAVE AN AMBULANCE STAFF WITH TO IT EMTS. SUPPOSED TO AN EMT AND A PARAMEDIC HIM TEASED WAITERS ARTS ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FOR PARAMEDICS SO THAT SORT OF OPERATIONAL CHANGE MIGHT REDUCE SOME OF THEIR COSTS. A OPERATIONAL CHANGES SUCH AS THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE RENEGOTIATED WITH THE COUNTIES BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD CHANGE THEIR CONTRACTS -- AND FINALLY. WE THINK THAT IN MANY INSTANCES AMBULANCE COMPANIES WILL WILL SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR CONTRACTS WITH THE COUNTY. I EMERGENCY SERVICES AGENCIES AND BY RENEGOTIATE I MEAN IN ORDER TO REMAIN PROFITABLE. THEY MAY SAY TO A COUNTY. THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO CONTINUE PAYING THE ANNUAL FEE THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT IN THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO REDUCE THIS ANNUAL FEE -- IN SOME CASES EVEN THEY MAY NOW BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS THE COUNTY WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT OF THESE NEW COSTS AND THE COULD IN THESE CASES. REQUIRE OR SEEK A SUBSIDY FROM THE COUNTY TO THE AMBULANCE PROVIDER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA. ODD GIVEN THE NEW COSTS -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGES SEVEN MOVEON DEBT TO THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY. AND IT WOULD. REQUIRED THAT HE M. TEAS AND PARAMEDICS REMAIN ON CALL DURING THEIR ENTIRE WORK SHIFT SO IN EFFECT IT WOULD BE A CONTINUATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF LONGSTANDING INDUSTRY PRACTICE. IT WOULD ALSO SEEK. TO TAKE THIS REQUIREMENT BUT DANTE AND PARAMEDICS STAY ON CALL AND APPLY RETROACTIVELY. TO LEGAL CASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE COURTS THAT EMTS AND PARAMEDICS HAVE BROUGHT AGAINST PRIVATE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS -- SEEKING. DAMAGES FOR FOR ALLEGED VIOLATION OF OF ME ON BREAK LOS. ADDITIONALLY THE MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS PROVIDE IMPROVED BREAK SCHEDULES FOR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS AND THAT THEY IMPLY. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND MAKE AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THEIR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS -- TURNING TO THE THE FINAL PAGE. WHERE WE ASSESS? THE LIKELY FISCAL AFFECTS OF THE INITIATIVE. THIS MEASURE IS SOMEWHAT COMPLEX BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE. TO ASSESS WHAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE IN THE AMBULANCE INDUSTRY UNDER THE ACOSTA DECISION. AND COMPARE THAT TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AYE IF VOTERS WERE TO APPROVE THE MEASURE. SO BECAUSE THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN NEW COSTS FOR AMBULANCE COMPANIES. AND THEREFORE NEW COSTS FOR FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENTS -- A CONTINUATION OF CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THIS MEASURE WOULD WOULD LIKELY RESULT. IN ARE FISCAL BENEFITS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND WE USED THE PHRASE FISCAL BENEFITS BECAUSE IN SOME CASES IT COULD BE ADDITIONAL FEE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTY. BUT IN OTHER CASES IT COULD BE A SMALLER SUBSIDY FROM THE COUNTY TO THE AMBULANCE PROVIDER IT COULD BE ANSWERED OF EITHER SIDE THE LEDGER SO WE TURN THAT FISCAL BENEFITS AGAIN AND IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ONLY. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THIS TIME. I THANK YOU MISTER ALAMO -- WAS ONE THING YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FOLLOWING -- WHAT WAS RECOMMENDED IN OF THIS LAW -- AUGUSTA SO COULD. RESULT IN COST OF HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHAT WHAT POLICE OFFICERS DO WHEN THEY WANT A MEAL BREAK I I DON'T POLICE OFFICERS? GET TO TAKE A DESIGNATED MIL BREAK WHETHER OR NOT ON CALL IN WITNESSES BE FOLLOWING THAT SAME PRACTICE. YOU KNOW I I WOULD BE ABLE TO TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC MEAL PROVISIONS OF OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND APOLOGIZE THAT. ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- STATE NEARBY IF YOU CAN THE MAYBE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS ABOUT HEARING -- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL MOVE FORWARD TO CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ENDLESS ASSOCIATION KIRK ON NATO LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE EMERGENCY AMBULANCE EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS ACT WELCOME -- MYSTERY KILLER YOU ALSO I KNOW THAT -- STAFF REACHED OUT TO A AMAR TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY ARE YOU REPRESENTING A MARK TODAY'S WELL I'M NOT I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION. VERY GOOD ARE THANK YOU PLEASE PRETTY SURE OF MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK I JUST BRIEFLY OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDS ASSOCIATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DID VOTE TO SUPPORT OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE AND I THINK YESTERDAY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD -- INDEED THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO BE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. BUT OUR ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS PRIVATE SECTOR. AYE EMS PERSONNEL THE EMTS AND PARAMEDICS THAT THE LA O. WAS TALKING ABOUT OR A OUR EMPLOYEES. WE CERTAINLY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND IN SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS A LOT OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES LIKE TO SAY WE ARE ACTUALLY THE ONLY. A RESPOND HERS IN THE END -- QUITE OFTEN. BECAUSE WHEN INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE STATE DIAL 911- THESE ARE THE FOLKS WHO I GET THERE -- TO SERVICE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS THE LA O. NOTED -- OUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE OR SO PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A RESPOND 275% OR THREE QUARTERS OF ALL OF THOSE NINE ONE ONE CALLS THAT COME THROUGH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TREATING AND RESPONDING TO THOSE NINE ONE ONE CALLS WHETHER THEY ARE. YOU KNOW A SLIP AND FALL WITH A BROKEN BONE OR OBVIOUSLY INDIVIDUALS WHO FACE MORE LIFE THREATENING -- CASES. WE ALSO I THINK ARE VERY GOOD -- COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IN THAT WE PROVIDE A TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE TO INDIVIDUALS -- WE ALSO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW CPR IN TRAINING TO SCHOOLS AND SENIOR CENTERS AND ELSEWHERE. SO HOW DID WE GET HERE ALLIES THE LA OWE INDICATED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION CAME DOWN. NOW WHILE AUGUSTA'S DID DEAL WITH SECURITY GUARDS AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAGE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAGE ORDERS IN THE STATE. THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SORT OF LANGUAGE. AND SO OUR INDUSTRY QUICKLY LOOKED AT IT AND THOUGHT WELL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO INTERPRET THAT EXACT SAME LANGUAGE IN OUR WAGE ORDER AS IN THE OTHER WAGE ORDER APPLICABLE TO SECURITY GUARDS. THAT SAYS WE CAN'T CONTACT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY ARE ON BREAK. THAT COULD HAVE SERIOUS -- PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSEQUENCES FOR THE AMBULANCE INDUSTRY. AND SO AS A RESULT WE ACTUALLY CAME FIRST TO THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU ON MISTER CHAIRMAN THURMAN. OF MIGHT RECALL THAT THERE WERE TWO MEASURES A YOUR VICE CHAIR -- HEATH FLORA INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION. AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL THE OPPONENTS TO THIS MEASURE THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM SHORTLY WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE SECOND MAJOR. ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ IS AB. TWO SIXTY THREE AND WE PURSUED LEGISLATION HAD LEAST INITIALLY BECAUSE AGAIN WE THOUGHT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ON A BREAK. THAT THEY BE A OF THAT WE BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE WE SIMPLY CAN'T. LET ME LET ME POINT SOMETHING OUT ONLY HOSPITALS. AND THE AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW. I TREAT EVERYONE. WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS 911- WE DON'T ASK HOW CAN YOU PAY FOR THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT? WE RESPOND HOSPITAL ER'S DUE. TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US SO ALL THOSE OTHER LIKE MEDI CAL PROVIDERS DOCTORS DENNIS. THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR PATIENTS WE CAN'T. WITH THE HOSPITAL ER THOUGH THEY GET TO YOU WHEN THEY GET TO YOU WE BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO DO SO WITHIN THE CONTRACTED PERIOD OF TIME. SO WE ARE VERY UNIQUE. AND AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES GET THE BRAKES THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED. TO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE INTERRUPTED. AND SO WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ AND THE SPONSORS OF THAT MEASURE THAT. WHILE IT PASSED THIS HOUSES NOW HAS BEEN SITTING THE PAST THREE QUARTERS OF A YEAR IN THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE -- AFTER PASSING THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE AND THE ISSUE THERE AND THAT HAS BEEN ALL ALONG IS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES GET THEIR BREAK. IF THEY ARE -- INTERRUPTED. THEY SHOULD BE RESCHEDULED. AND IF THEY CAN'T BE RESCHEDULED. THEN THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT ONE HOUR PENALTY PAY. THAT'S WHAT EXISTING LAW HAS BEEN FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS THAT'S WHAT IT CONTINUE SHOULD THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE. NOW THAT IS WHAT WE ATTEMPTED TO DO LEGISLATIVELY AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT DID NOT COME TO FRUITION. IN THE MEANTIME OR DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESSENTIALLY SAID THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION IS APPLICABLE TO EVERYBODY WHICH WHETHER I PERSONALLY LIKE IT OR NOT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A LOGICAL PLACE FOR THEM TO END UP BECAUSE AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER ALL THE WAGE ORDERS HAVE THE SAME SORT OF LANGUAGE THAT WAS INTERPRETED. IN THE AUGUSTA'S DECISION. I'M JUST A QUOTE FROM THAT DECISION ONE SENDS DURING REQUIRED REST PERIODS. EMPLOYERS MUST RELIEVE THEIR EMPLOYEES OF ALL DUTIES AND RELINQUISH ANY CONTROL OVER HOW EMPLOYEE SPEND THEIR BREAK TIME. SO AGAIN THAT MEANS RADIOS TWO WAY COMMUNICATION DEVICES PAGER CELL PHONES THAT WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE OFF AND AGAIN. WHEN WE HAVE TO RESPOND WITHIN MINUTES GENTLY FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES OR CONTRACTED TIME DEPENDING ON JURISDICTIONS AND ALL? WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T BE CONTACTED AND I THINK QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT POINT. BUT NONE THE LESS BECAUSE THE COURT INTERPRETATION OF THIS. THE APPLICATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AS TO ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES AND THE FAILURE OF A LEGISLATIVE FIX LAST YEAR. DROVE THE PROPONENTS OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE TO PROCEED TO THE BALLOT -- AND I THINK THAT IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. IS ADEQUATELY INSURED --% IT'S JUST UNREALISTIC FROM OUR HUMBLE PERSPECTIVE TO THINK THAT THAT -- INTERPRETATION WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OUR INDUSTRY AGAIN WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS 911- THEY EXPECT PROMPT SERVICE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CONTRACTED AND LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DO -- IT DOES HAVE SOME OTHER PROVISIONS. BUT IN THE BILL IT HAS THREE MAIN PROVISIONS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WHY WE ENDORSED THE BALLOT MEASURE. THE FIRST IS TRAINING ANNUALLY FOR MASS CASUALTY ACTIVITIES. A ACTIVE SHOOTERS AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS -- HAVING THAT ANNUAL TRAINING IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR PERSONNEL OF COURSE IT'S APPROPRIATELY EMPLOYER PAID. THE SECOND MAJOR PROVISION IS EMPLOYERPAID -- MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS A EDUCATION AND COVERAGE. UP TO TEN MENTAL HEALTH VISITS PER YEAR AGAIN EMPLOYER PAID. AND THEN OF COURSE TO CONTINUE THE FIVE DECADE PLUS APPROACH -- IN TERMS OF MEAL AND REST BREAKS WHICH AGAIN. A THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO WE WANT OUR EMPLOYEES ENTITLED TO IT. AND IF WE HAVE TO INTERRUPT THOSE MEAL REST BREAKS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RESCHEDULED AND IF WE CAN'T THEY SHOULD BE COMPENSATED TO DO SO UP FOR FOR US BEING UNABLE TO RESCHEDULE THEM. THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHAT IT CONTINUE SHOULD BE. UP BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS SORT OF AN EFFORT THAT'S ENCAPSULATED IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IF WE CAN ACHIEVE A LEGISLATIVE FIX. AND OF THE COURTS OBVIOUSLY VIEW THIS LANGUAGE IN A CERTAIN WAY WHICH IS NOT ASCERTAIN IS NOT -- IN PRIVATE -- EMT SERVICE SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OTHERWISE I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME -- QUESTION AT THIS TIME -- COMMITTEE NOTES THAT -- SPEAK IT LEAVES A FREQUENT PARTICIPATOR IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER TRIPS OUT WE WILL HEAR FROM SO NATO. I I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD OF THE NON THIS MCKINLEY'S POINTS I WOULD JUST -- REITERATE THAT IT ARE THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A FIFTY YEAR -- INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND THAT THE MEASURE PROVIDES IN UNIFORM STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND TRAINING FOR EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE APPRECIATES BREVITY THANK YOU -- QUICK THANK YOU WILL NOT HEAR FROM THE OPPONENTS -- WHO ALSO HAVE TEN MINUTES OF THE COMMITTEE WELCOMES BACK -- JASON BRITTANY WHO HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE WELCOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR UNITED EMS WORKERS ASKING LOCAL. FORTY NINE ELEVEN TOM GO TO HELL -- GOTHAM GOT I THINK I TOM THANK YOU LEGAL COUNSEL TO UNITE EMS WORKERS ASK ME LOCAL. FORTY NINE ELEVEN IN JUST WILL GO GO LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MANAGER OF FROM ASK ME. WE ARE READY WHEN YOU AYE SIR APPRECIATE IT -- AT THANK YOU BOTH CHAIRS RAVENOUS TODAY THE REST THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF'S SECTARIAN TEASING PARAMEDICS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF ALSO A TWENTY FIVE YEAR PARAMEDIC IN THIS -- COUNTY SANTA CLARA. I FIND MYSELF IN AN INTERESTING POSITION TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING HERE IN THE OPPOSITION TABLE BUT YET WE ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY SUPPORT PORTIONS OF THIS INITIATIVE. AND CONCEPTUALLY -- SUPPORT MOST OF THE INITIATIVE BUT LET'S MAKE NOT NO MISTAKE ABOUT THIS. THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL DID NOT MENTION THAT THIS IS A LIABILITY PROTECTION ISSUE. ON THE CIVIL LITIGATION THAT THE LA THOSE OFFICE. REFERENCED IN HIS [inaudible] THAT TESTIMONY. LAST YEAR TO SIX THREE WAS A FILTER. REMEDY THE ISSUES WITH THE INDUSTRIAL WAGE ORDER BECAUSE WE SUPPORT AN ON DUTY MEAL PERIOD AS WELL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS. THE INDUSTRIAL WAGE ORDER THE IT JUSTICE RULING. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY TO OUR SEX. IT LEADS TO SAFETY ISSUES AND RESPONSE ISSUES AND WE AGREE WITH THAT. AS AN AFFECT WE HAD LEGISLATION AND WE WERE NEGOTIATING. TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES AND THAT COURT RULING. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN WITH THE AUTHORS OF THIS INITIATIVE WHEN WE WERE NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE THEM THE LIABILITY PROTECTION THAT THEY WERE SEEKING. WE ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE ON ACTIVE SHOOTER AND AND MASS CASUALTY TRAINING. UNFORTUNATELY THAT REALLY IS NON SUBSTANTIVE IN THIS ISSUE. AND THIS INITIATIVE. COUNTY LENDS THROUGH WHAT U. AUSSIE PROGRAMS FUND MASS CASUALTY TRAININGS ON A YEARLY BASIS THAT IS A CONTINUED PROCESS THAT I PARTICIPATED IN THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. THIS INITIATIVE DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADD. ANYTHING TO THAT PROCESS. I SAID AS A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE AUTHOR WITH THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION ON CROSS. FUNCTIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE MITIGATION FOR ACTIVE SHOOTER HOSTILE ADVANCE. THE ARTICLE ON ACTIVE SHOOTERS IS NOT SPECIFIC IT DOESN'T ADD ANY DETAILS AS TO WHAT THAT LEVEL OF TRAINING WILL BE. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TRAINING I GET FROM THE AUTHOR THE COMPANY THAT I WORK. FOR WILL BE SUB STANDARD OF THAT AND SO I APPROVED -- STAND. SO FUNDAMENTALLY WE AGREE ON A LOT OF THIS WE AGREE ON THE EAP STANDARDS WE AGREE ON IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. FOR OUR PROVIDERS AYE WE WOULD NEVER STAND THE WAY OF MORE. I SERVICES FOR THAT. BUT AGAIN EAP IS A STANDARD. THAT IS SUB STANDARD TO THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE. WE HAVE ISSUES OF Q. CRITICAL STRESS OFTENTIMES MY PROVIDERS GO TO EAP COUNSELORS THEIR MARRIAGE AND FAMILY COUNSELORS. WHICH ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PTSD IN THE CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT THERAPY THAT WE NEED SO AGAIN. IT'S SUB STANDARD BUT IT IS AN INCREASE THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IN CONCEPT. BUT AGAIN WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS THAT THIS INITIATIVE SEEKS FOR PRIVATE PROVIDERS FOR VIOLATING THE WAGE ORDER WHICH WAS AFFIRMED BY THAT'S THE COURTS. AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGHOUT THE NEXT COMING YEARS TO CREATE A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. BUT THAT PROCESS BROKE DOWN WHEN THE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS WERE NOT GUARANTEED A HIGH BEHALF DURING THE NEGOTIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GOTTA. THANK YOU. ARE. THANK YOU TO THEIR COMMITTEE CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE LEGAL BACKGROUND THAT LED TO THIS INITIATIVE -- ONE THING I'D LIKE TO START WITH IS THAT THE A JUSTICE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DID NOT CHANGE THE LAW THESE PRACTICES HAVE BEEN UNLAWFUL SINCE THEY WERE INITIATED IT. IN IT INTERPRETED. LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN IN THESE WAGE ORDERS FOR DECADES. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS INITIATIVE IS IT'S NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURE IT'S A MEASURE TO FOR AND ARE IN PARTICULAR TO AVOID LIABILITY THIS IS A MARGIN ISSUED OF THEIR SPENT OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER -- SOLICITING SIGNATURES ALREADY. I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THERE OF ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS CAMPAIGN. NOW AMHERST TO DEFEND THE NORWEGIAN OUR CASE THAT. IS THAT THREATENS TO IMPOSE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LIABILITY ON THEM. FOR THERE PRACTICES INVOLVING REST BREAKS AND MEAL BREAKS OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE. NOW THAT LIABILITY HAS INCREASED BECAUSE AMHERST LITIGATION STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DELAY THAT CASE FOR A DECADE. AND IT'S NOW FINALLY APPROACHING TRIAL IN THE US WE HAVE THE URGENCY THAT IS RAISED BY THIS INITIATIVE. AND IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT THE POSITION OF THE PROPONENTS IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT. THE THE PRIVATE AND THOSE INDUSTRIES SPENT A DECADE ARGUING THAT THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OFF DUTY REST NO BREAKS. IF THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO THEN THERE'S NO PURPOSE TO THIS INITIATIVE IF THEY DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO THEN THE INITIATIVE IS MAINLY HERE TO FOR THEM TO AVOID THEIR OWN LIABILITY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE WE DISAGREE WITH THE LA WAS ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFIT TO COUNTIES BECAUSE WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THAT. CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED IN PRACTICE WE THINK THAT. THESE ARE COSTS THAT. HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND THEY AND THE BASICALLY IF IF AMHERST CORRECT THAT THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BREAKS UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. THEN THERE WILL BE NO FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS INITIATIVE IT WILL DO NOTHING. IF I AM ARE IS CURRENTLY IN VIOLATION OF THE WAGE ORDERS. AND THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS THAT. THERE IS UP -- SECTION EIGHT EIGHT NINE OF THIS INITIATIVE CREATES A PROPORTIONATELY IN A RETROACTIVE LIABILITY SHIELD. AND IT'S IT'S QUITE EXPLICIT ABOUT IT'S IN TOWN IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THAT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE AND IT WOULD BE THE SOURCE OF LITIGATION. BUT IF AMHERST CURRENTLY A VIOLATION OF THE WAGE ORDER AND THAT RETROACTIVE LIABILITY SHIELDS ENFORCEABLE. TEN AM ARE WOULD BENEFIT AM ARE RECEIVABLE WINDFALL THAT IS ESSENTIALLY DERIVED FROM THE EARNED WAGES OF THE EMMAUS WORKERS. NOW THESE ARE RELATIVELY LOW PAID WORKERS AND CRITICAL HIGH STRESS JOBS. THE USER PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TIME OFF TO REST AND RECOVER FROM IT CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL PROFESSIONS. AND WE FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE THAT EMS WORKERS SHOULD RECEIVE IMPROVE TRAINING AND IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE WE SIMPLY DON'T THINK THAT. CAMERAS UNILATERAL INITIATIVE IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. THANK YOU I DON'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. I THINK YOU -- STROKE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THURMOND AND SENATOR LARA ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA JOSH WILL GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES OF CHINA TO REHASH ANYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE COLLEAGUES HAVE COVERED. I WILL SAY THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE AND MARK DIDN'T SEE FIT TO COME A SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEIR OWN INITIATIVE I THINK MY COLLEAGUE COVERED THAT THIS IS REALLY JUST AN ATTEMPT. A VERY CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES OF DECADES OF LIABILITY -- THE LA O. CALLED IT A LONG STANDING PRACTICE -- MR MCKEE LEE SAID IT WAS A FIVE DECADE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISN'T THE NEW COSTS REFERRED TO BY THE LA JOH. THESE OF WAGES THAT BEEN STOLEN FROM EMPLOYEES OVER DECADES AND SO THE APPROACH THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE SOME NEW COSTS FOR THE COMPANIES ARE FOR COUNTIES MISGUIDED BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY JUST AN ATTEMPT. TO RELIEVE LIABILITY FOR THESE COMPANIES FOR NOT PAYING THEIR EMPLOYEES. OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND IT THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE ASPECT OF THIS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO HIDE IT BY PROVIDING. THE SOME BENEFITS -- THAT COULD ARGUE PROVIDED UNDER CONTRACTS IN THAT WERE PROPOSED IN LEGISLATION THAT WE GOT FOR LAST YEAR. A AND BECAUSE OF THAT WHEN OPPOSITION. NOT I WILL ALSO SAY -- THAT WE APPRECIATE THE APPROACH OF THIS COMMITTEE -- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS WERE HAPPY ANSWER. THANK YOU ARE TRYING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. A SEEN NONE -- WE WILL HEAR OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC TESTIMONY ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU -- TO THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UMRIGAR YES YOU ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. AGREE WITH -- WITH THEIR OPPONENTS SAID HERE ARTERIES WERE INVOLVED IN THAT JUSTICE DECISION AND AGREED THAT IT WAS NOT A CHANGE IN LAW AND THAT -- WE THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY PROBLEMATIC THAT THESE BALLOT INITIATIVES ARE TRYING -- TO ALLOW AND THESE EMPLOYERS TO ESCAPE LIABILITY FOR CLEAR VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW SO WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. PERSONS WISHING TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED MEASURE. ANYONE ELSE WISHING GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT -- THIS COMMITTEE THIS JOINT HEARING -- IS FOR TO HELP MEET THE REQUIREMENTS -- THAT THERE BE SUCH A HEARING FOR ANY MEASURE THAT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT. AS THIS -- MEASURE APPARENTLY HAS QUALIFIED IT'LL BE UP TO THE VOTERS EYES TO THE DIRECTION THAT THIS WILL TAKE A SEEING NOTHING FROM THE MEMBERS AND SEE NOTHING FROM PUBLIC COMMENT. AT THIS CONCLUDES AT THE HEARING ON THE BALLOT MEASURE WILL ADJOURN THE JOINT SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LABOR [inaudible] COMMITTEE HERE. I THINK YOU. OUT WE INVITE THOSE VIEW WHO ARE HERE FOR ARE NORMALLY SCHEDULED TO US ON THE LABOR COMMITTEE -- TO REMAIN WITH US AND OUR WE WILL CALL AUTHORS AS THEY MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE
