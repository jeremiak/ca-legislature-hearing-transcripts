THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE FOR AB THREE SEVEN ONE WHICH EXTENDS EXISTING LIABILITY PROTECTIONS TO PEDESTRIANS IF THEY'RE INJURED BY ELECTRIC SCOOTER ELECTRIC BIKE COLLECTIVELY E. DEVICES. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF BRAILLE AND TACTILE LET US. TO THESE DEVICE SO NON VISUAL PEDESTRIANS HAVE CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE AN INJURY REPORT IF THEY EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT SUCH AS TRIPPING OVER AN ABANDONED P. DEVICE ON THE SIDEWALK. MY FIRST APPROACHED BY THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF BLIND I NEED TO REACH OUT TO MY BROTHER DR FRED JONES AS HE IS ALSO NON VISUAL. I RECALL A TIME WHEN I HELPED MY BROTHER. INTO A BATHROOM WHEN I GOT MARRIED. LIKE TO NOTE THAT RECENT AMENDMENTS ADDED DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT. INSURANCE CARRIERS WHO PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO BY THE TIME OF ENACTMENT. AN EXAMPLE OF THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO BROAD COVERAGE FOR EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION MODELS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THE PARENT COMPANIES OF MANY OF THE DEVICE PROVIDERS RELIED ON ON THE SAME INSURANCE CARRIERS. TO CREATE AND PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WHEN THEY FIRST. BEGAN OPERATIONS FURTHER AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE LIABILITY WOULDN'T WHAT'S THIS WHICH NOT SOLELY. FALL ON THE KEY DEVICE PROVIDERS FOR INJURIES AND DAMAGES CAUSED BY USERS AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN AND PREVIOUS COMMITTEES TO INDEMNIFY. TO INDEMNIFY PROVIDERS FOR USER NEGLIGENCE. SUCH AS INTOXICATED RIDING ARE TEXTING WHILE RIDING THE SCOOTERS. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE USER HAS LIABILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY AB THREE SEVEN ONE REMOVES THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM ACCIDENT VICTIMS BY ENSURING PEDESTRIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE NOT VISUAL THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE A METHOD TO BE COMPENSATED IF INSURED BY IMPROPER USE OF STORAGE DEVICES. IN ADDITION BY STAFF HAS FOUND THAT MANY OF YOU ON THIS FLOOR HAVE ASKED ME. IS THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDER WE'VE PROVIDED TO INSURANCE PROVIDERS. MIGHT NOT BE MY STAFF HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIND TO INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND I WHAT I LIKE THE INDUSTRY TO DO. UBER AND LIFT THE PARENT COMPANY'S IN THE OTHERS IS TO COME TO ME COULD YOU DO NOT WANT. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DEPARTMENT INSURANCE OR GOVERNMENT THIS SET BACK INSURANCE RATE AND SO I WILL WORK WITH THEM IF THE BILL MOVES OUT HERE WE GET TO THE OTHER HOUSE. TO NOT ONLY IN PUT IN LANGUAGE THAT GIVES HIM SOME COMFORT THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIABLE FOR. BUT MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A INSURANCE VEHICLE THAT WON'T BANKRUPT. THAT IT WILL BE WITHIN SOME GOOD GUIDELINES THAT MAKES SENSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MISS CHANCELLOR'S. USE SEEING MR FRAZIER WITH HIS MICROPHONE UP THIS FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IN THIS BILL IS THE OPPORTUNITY AND IT'S THE SAME MODEL AS THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES WHERE THE USER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR ANY KIND OF- OF NEGLIGENCE OR WHATEVER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO CREATE A HOPE THE AUTHOR IS ABLE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND ON THIS IS NOT CREATE A MONOPOLY ON ENSURING THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE GOING FORWARD BUT AGAIN WE ALREADY HAVE A MODEL. IT'S AN APP BASED KIND OF PROGRAM THEY CAN OPT OUT OR OPT FOR BUT ULTIMATELY THE USER SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. GOING FORWARD IN ANY OF THESE APPLICATIONS I REQUEST ARRIVAL WITH THAT CABBIE OUGHT THAT THEY GO THROUGH AND THE AUTHOR MAKES OF THE EFFORTS TO VERY CLEARLY DEFINING INTENT. THANK YOU. THANK U. S.

OF A MAN WHO HAS A PIZZA PARLOR IN HE ACTUALLY ORDERED HIS OWN PIZZA TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE CHARGING TEN DOLLARS MORE FOR THE PIZZA THEN HE CHARGES AT HIS STORE THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY RIGHT NOW FOR RESTAURANTS FOR CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW MUCH THE COST ATTRACT THE PAIN ON DELIVERY AND WHERE THOSE COSTS ARE HIDDEN. THE OTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IS IT ENSURES THAT TIPS THAT ARE GIVEN- BY A CUSTOMER ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO THE- WORKER DOING THE WORK SO THERE'S BEEN EXAMPLES UNFORTUNATELY OF COMPANIES- TAKING THEIR DRIVER STEPS IN THIS WOULD JUST ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR TIPS LIKE THEY WOULD IN ANY OTHER JOB. THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THEIR LOCAL CHAMBERS HAVE REMOVED OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FALLING AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN PRIVACY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THIRTY NINE WOULD CODIFY AND RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA CHINA CLIMATE INSTITUTE TO ACCELERATE CLIMATE ACTION THROUGH COOPERATIVE EFFORTS AND EXCHANGES. BETWEEN TWO OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMIC POWERS AND MAJOR EMITTERS OF GREENHOUSE GASES CALIFORNIA AND CHINA. CHINA CURRENTLY ADMITS DIOXIDE BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S PROXIMITY TO CHINA IT BENEFITS OUR STATE GREATLY OF CHINA IS ABLE TO REDUCE IS GHG EMISSIONS. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THE SMOGGIEST OF METRO AREA IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE TWENTY FIRST TIME IN TWENTY TWO YEARS. NINE OF THE TEN SMOGGIEST COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE IN CALIFORNIA WITH SAMPOERNA DINO RIVERSIDE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES BEING THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD WORST IN THE NATION. TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND REDUCE EMISSIONS WE MUST ALSO HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN JUNIOR HELPED LAUNCH THE CALIFORNIA CHINA INSTITUTE. TO PROMOTE CLIMATE ACTION THROUGH JOINT RESEARCH TRAINING AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND CHINA. THE INSTITUTE IS PARTNERING WITH LEADING ACADEMIC AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN CHINA AND PROVIDING A PLATFORM TO BUILD THESE URGENTLY NEEDED PARTNERSHIPS. THE INSTITUTE ADVANCES JOINT POLICY RESEARCH ON MAJOR CLIMATE ISSUES INCLUDING LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES CARBON PRICING CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE SUSTAINABLE LAND USE AND CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND AND POLICY ENFORCEMENT. I PASSING AB THIRTY NINE AND FORMALIZING THE INSTITUTE IN STATE LAW THE LEGISLATURE CAN SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY TO REVERSE CLIMATE CHANGE BY ADVANCING JOIN CLIMATE RESEARCH THROUGH COLLABORATION. THROUGH THE INSTITUTE. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU MR CHILD. MR LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. HI I HAVE. RISE IN OPPOSITION NOT BECAUSEIT'S UNNECESSARY WHICH IT IS UC CAN CONTINUE DOING WHATEVER PARTNERSHIPS IT WANTS REGARDLESS OF TODAY'S ACTION. I'M I'M RISING BECAUSE IT IS- CONDONING I IN DOING THIS PARTNERSHIP. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA TODAY. THAT A STATE THAT IS FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS A LEADER ON SO MUCH THAT WE LEAD ON VALUES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT. WE WANT TO CODIFY IN LAW A PARTNERSHIP. WITH A COUNTRY THAT UNDER THE PAST PRESIDENT SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO HAD DESCRIBED WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO UIGHUR MINORITIES. THREE MILLION IN SLAVE IMPRISONED IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. WOMEN FORCIBLY STERILIZED TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES. THAT MIGHT COMPEL CALL THAT GENOCIDE AND THAT NOW UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN SECRETARY BLANK AND HAS ALSO DESCRIBED. AS GENOCIDE. THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY BILL. WE PASS EVERY YEAR HOW MANY BILLS NO MORALIZING A GENOCIDE THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE PAST HOW MANY RESOLUTIONS SYMBOLIC IN NATURE PERFORMATIVE AT BEST AND THEN HERE WE ARE. MIGHTY CALIFORNIA WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CHINA RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW WHAT IS OCCURRING TO WOMEN AND MEN THAT ARE THERE AS SLAVES. AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE HAVEN'T KNOWN ABOUT GENOCIDES IN THE PAST AND DONE NOTHING AS WELL. ON YOM HASHOAH HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY SECRETARY BLINKING TALKED ABOUT HOW LEADERS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY TRIED TO SCRUB AWAY THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLOCAUST SO THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE IT BE SIGNED ON TO LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT HERE WE ACTUALLY DO KNOW IT. SO WILL THIS JUST BE ANOTHER BENIGN BILL. THAT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT WE PASS AND THAT THE WORLD WATCHES AND SAYS. WHAT DID CALIFORNIA DO WHAT DID ANY NATION DO WHEN THEY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CHINA. ARE WE JUST GOING TO RUBBER STAMP THIS. RIGHT NOW IT'S NIGHT TIME IN JOHN J. WORTH THREE MILLION PEOPLE ARE IMPRISONED. AND THERE IS A YOUNG LADY THERE WHO IS AFRAID FOR HER LIFE. AND SHE'S WONDERING IF SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IN A DISTANT CAPITAL HERE'S HER CRISIS. I HEAR HER CRIES. BUT YOU KNOW WHO'S LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS THE SCARY THING. CHINA BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE RUBBER STAMP THIS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GET AWAY WITH IMPRISONING UIGHURS. AND DOING MEDICAL. EXAM YEAH OF. FORCIBLY STERILIZING WOMEN AND WE WILL JUST CONTINUE TO VOTE FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEM NO NO NO NO NO I AM DONE WITH THESE RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING ATROCITIES NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO ACTUALLY USE OUR VOTES TO SAY NEVER AGAIN WE ARE NOT RUBBER STAMPING WE WILL WE DO NOT NEED TO REQUIRE THIS IN LAW IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE REQUIRED. IT CAN GO ON MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T. BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THIS BILL PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING NOW. THANK YOU MR LEVINE SAYING NO. ADDITIONAL DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MR SHOUT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER SPEAKER I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES POSITION AND SENTIMENT AND I'M SURE THAT CHINA IS POLICIES THAT NOT ALL OF US AGREE WITH. BUT YET I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ISOLATE AND SEPARATE ISSUES AND IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEM ON AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. WHICH IS ALSO IN LINE WITH WHAT THE BITING ADMINISTRATION IS DOING IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA AND AS I STATED IN MY OPENING REMARKS- CHINA CURRENTLY IN ITS 20% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON DIOXIDE. END UP. THAT TRANSLATES TO ABOUT TEN BILLION. METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE AIR THAT'S WHAT WOOD BRIEFING TODAY. STILL THE SOONER THEY CAN GET THAT NUMBER DOWN THE SOONER WE CAN BE THERE CLEANER AIR. SO WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN HELPING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO WE GOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. HEY MICHELLE AND WITH THAT CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. ALL MEMBERS OF. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. IT IS AT ABOUT. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. YEAH THE CALL. MISTER SHALL MOVE THE CALL. I CAN FILE ORDER FILE ITEM SIXTY NINE THROUGH. EIGHTY ONE ASCERTAIN. WE ARE AT FILE ITEM EIGHTY TWO. AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT BY MR MAYES. CORKERY ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES AN ACCOLADE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MR MAYS YOU MAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT IS RATHER SIMPLE AND STRIKES AT THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. WE MUST ENSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT LEADS TO THE BEST ELECTED REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE. THIS BILL GUARANTEES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTY SUPERVISORS BY ALLOWING THEM TO STAND FOR RE ELECTION AND GAIN EXPERTISE ON THE JOB THROUGH A MINIMUM OF TWO ELECTED TERMS IN OFFICE. WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IS LAID OUT IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SO WE HAVE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE THAT ARE NOT JUST INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. LET ME BE CLEAR. AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT DOES NOT CONTAIN A RETROACTIVE CLAUSE NOR WILL I ALLOW ONE TO BE AMENDED INTO THE BILL. THEREFORE THIS BILL DOES NOT DIRECTLY OVERTURN ANY LOCAL MEASURE NOR IS IT SUPPOSED TO. HOWEVER A RECENT LOCAL MEASURE HIGHLIGHTED A DEFICIENCY IN STATE LAW THAT WE MUST ADDRESS RESULTING IN THIS BILL BEFORE US TODAY THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY LABOR AND PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS ALL THREE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD REPRESENT ALL THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER MESS. MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YEAH THANK YOU MEMBERS IT AND MISTER SPEAKER- YEAH THIS BILL IS NOT RETROACTIVE- I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD PROACTIVELY HERE. GOING INTO THE FUTURE TELL LOCAL VOTERS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITH REGARD TO THEIR LOCAL ELECTED THEIR LOCAL ELECTED. AND WHAT TYPE OF TERM LIMITS THEY SHOULD HAVE. IS NOT FOR US OF THE STATE TO DETERMINE THOSE THINGS RIGHT. IT SHOULD BE UP TO LOCAL VOTERS TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY WANT IN TERMS OF. THE TERM LIMITS THE PAY THE COMPENSATION- AND WHATEVER LOCAL RULES THAT THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES FOR INSTANCE- THAT THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR THEIR LOCAL ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IT SHOULD BE US AT THE STATE LEVEL TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO. AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD ASK THAT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THEY WERE SKELETOR MISTER RAMOS YOU HAVE RECOGNIZE FROM HER DESK THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN. STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- I SPOKE UP AGAINST HIS BILL LOCAL GOVERNMENT- WITH THE AUTHOR- CONTINUE. TO OFFER TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE. THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS IN THIS BILL ONE DEALS WITH THE TERM LIMITS IN THAT PART OF THE BILL TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK INTO THE ELECTORATE. THERE'S A SECOND PART OF THE BILL THAT HAS CAUSED ME GREAT CONCERN. IN THAT SECTION TWO. THAT ADS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. TO THE COUNTY BOARD THE COUNTY BOARD AUTHORITY TO SET THEIR OWN SALARY. IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY CURRENTLY THERE'S BEEN THREE REFERENDUMS THAT HAVE DEALT WITH TERM LIMITS. AND SALARIES CURRENTLY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RECEIVED PLUS BENEFITS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL THE EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES IN SEMINOLE COUNTY LIVE FAR BELOW THAT AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME. ALLOWING THOSE TO SET THEIR OWN SALARY IN ANY BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE STRONG OPPOSITION TO. AND NOT ONLY THAT. THAT WE ALSO SEE THAT THE VOTERS OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY VOTED SIXTY SIX PERCENT. ON THIS ISSUE OF TERM LIMITS AND SALARY AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME. THERE IS A SERIES OF ELECTION SERIES OF REFERENDUMS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. N. NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING OUT IN THE WAY THAT SOME WOULD LIKE. COME TO THE STATE THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE AT ITS FINEST HOUR THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE THAT SHOULD GO BACK. TO THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED BECAUSE AFTER ALL. IS THAT GENERAL FUND THAT'S PAYING THE SALARIES THE SALARIES OF EMPLOYEES THE SALARIES OF ALL THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND IT ALSO IS THEIR VOICE THAT WAS HEARD WITH OVERWHELMING OVER WHILE MEAN PARTICIPATION OF 77% OF THE LECTERN. THE OF THE AUTHOR WILL SAY THIS HAS NO BEARING ON OVERTURNING THAT REFERENDUM HOWEVER IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD IT WILL BECOME THE LAW IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ELECTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH ME ON THIS. BAKER WAS WRONG NEVER. PLEASE KEEP YOUR CONVERSATIONS TO A MINIMUM. PLEASE THE RETENTION OF HIS RACE WAS RAMPS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER I REGRETTABLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. FOR ME THIS IS A BILL THAT SPECIFICALLY AFFECTS THE VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT AND IN GREATER SAMBAR TO DINO COUNTY IT AFFECTS THE VALUE OF THEIR VOTE. AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT WOULD UNDO THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN ST BERNARD DINO COUNTY WHO JUST LAST YEAR IS MY COLLEAGUE FROM HIGHLAND NOTED. JUST LAST YEAR VOTED TO APPROVE MEASURE K. BY A TWO THIRDS MARGIN WHICH PLACES TERM AND SALARY LIMITS ON MEMBERS OF THE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY IS THE ONLY COUNTY IN WHICH THE VOTERS SPECIFICALLY VOTED ON THESE ISSUES. ALTHOUGH THIS BILL WOULD APPEAR TO BE BROADER IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS BILL AFFECTS THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE RELATED TO THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNADINO. WHILE I MAY AGREE WITH SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OF THE AUTHOR. AS TO WHY SUCH LIMITED TERMS IN PUBLIC OFFICE WOULD AFFECT OUR GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE. I MUST OPPOSE BECAUSE THIS WOULD UNDO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN FEEL. THEY ARE WITHOUT A VOICE THIS BILL SENDS A MESSAGE TO PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT THAT IN SPITE OF THEIR OVERWHELMING VOTE THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S GOING TO REVERSE THEIR DECISION WITHOUT ANY INPUT OF THE COMMUNITY NOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW ELECTION TO REVISIT AND DECIDE THE ISSUE A NEW. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS BUT I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISS REYES MISTER MATHIS WE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS I I'VE LOOKED AT THE BILL I'VE LOOKED AT A DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT I REALLY WANT TO READ FROM ALL RC RC FROM A RURAL COUNTIES- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM THAT'S WHAT I REPRESENT AND I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY IS IMPORTANT HERE. SAYS WRITING TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT. FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. FOUR TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD ENSURE. THAT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO TERM LIMITS. ARE LIMITED TO NO FEWER. THEN TO TERMS. MEMBERS MANY OF US CAME IN WHEN TERM LIMITS CHANGED WE SAW A DROP IN SHRINK OUR STATE LOST ABILITY. THE PEOPLE LOST POWER THIS IS JUST TRYING TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTY SUPERVISORS HAVE LONGEVITY. THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE STAYS THERE. IN THAT ARE COUNTIES CAN MAINTAIN STRONG WITH THAT I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM. MR MAYS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- AND MEMBERS I REALLY GENUINELY ENJOY THE DEBATE IN FACT I KNOW HERE ON THE FLOOR A WE OFTEN DON'T DEBATE THE ISSUES I'M SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ESPECIALLY- IN THE COMMENTS OF MY TWO COLLEAGUES FROM SENATOR DINO- I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THEM- ON.

LET ME DEAL WITH THE PAY QUESTION FIRST THE PAY QUESTION. IS AND I DON'T I'VE NEVER VOTED FOR A BILL IT SAID ITS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW THIS JUST CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW AND CLARIFIES WHAT IS IN THE CONSTITUTION. IN ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTION ONE IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY CLEAR SO THE STATUTE IS JUST CLARIFIES THAT SO LET'S DISPENSE WITH THE SECOND THE SECOND PART OF IT THE FIRST THE FIRST PART OF IT. IS IN REGARDS TO TERM LIMITS. AND ALTHOUGH A MY CALL IT COLLEAGUES FROM JUST UP THE ROAD HERE IT HAD SAID THAT WE SHOULDN'T LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I THINK ALL OF US AGREE. HERE IN THIS BUILDING THAT WHEN WE ARE AT SIX YEAR TERMS. FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MAXIMO SIX YEARS IT WAS A DISASTER. AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER AND THAT TWELVE YEARS IS A MUCH BETTER AMOUNT OF TIME THIS BILL SAYS THAT YOU GET. TO TERMS A MINIMUM OF TWO TERMS EIGHT YEARS AND THE VOTERS CAN STILL DO TERM LIMITS IT'S JUST THAT THEY GET.

B. SEVEN SEVEN THREE AUTHORIZES LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT A RULE OR REGULATION TO DESIGNATE A LOCAL STREET WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION AS A SLOW ST. THE TWENTY THE IDEA WAS TO IDENTIFY STREETS WERE THROUGH TRAFFIC WOULD BE BANNED LIMITING STREETS SO PEOPLE COULD USE THE PAVEMENT FOR EXERCISE AND RECREATION DURING THE TIME OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS IMPLEMENTED TEMPORARY PROGRAMS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THAT HAVE CREATED MORE THAN FIFTY MILES OF SLOW STREETS FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED IT MOST SIMILAR TO OTHER CITIES ACROSS THE NATION AND ABROAD WE PURPOSING STREETS TO PRIORITIZE COMMUNITY NEEDS HAS BEEN A WINNING CONCEPT CREATING MORE OPEN SPACE FOR BICYCLING WALKING. RECREATING WHILE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES TO SPEND TIME THE SLOW STREETS PROGRAM HAS BEEN MET WITH AN OVERWHELMING DEMAND FROM RESIDENTS AND DOZENS OF NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WAITING ON LOCAL INSTALLATIONS TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND TO REALIZE THE FULL LONG TERM BENEFITS LOW STREETS NEEDS PERMANENCE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

I AGREE ASSEMBLY RULE THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN AND AFTER LIVING HEALING ARTS MEASURE WHEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WILL AUTHORIZE PHARMACISTS TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES LIKE HEALTH SCREENINGS AND ALLOW THEM TO ADMINISTER MANY CLIA WAIVED TESTS. PHARMACISTS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM BY UTILIZING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ACCESSIBILITY TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY PATIENT CARE. PHARMACISTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY PERMITTED TO PROVIDE MORE THAN A FEW CLIA WAIVED TESTS EVEN THOUGH THESE TESTS ARE DEFINED BY THE FDA AS SIMPLE TESTS WITH A LOW RISK FOR AN INCORRECT RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY PHARMACISTS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWED TO PROVIDE HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR CONDITIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MEDICATION REGIMES. THIS FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE KEY ROLE PHARMACISTS CONSERVE TO PREVENT REDUCE OR MITIGATE PROGRESSION OF DISEASE BY CONDUCTING SCREENING IS THAT REFERRING PATIENTS TO IDENTIFIED HEALTH ISSUES WITH IDENTIFIED HEALTH ISSUES WITH POSITION. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT MINIMISES BARRIERS AND RESTRICTIONS AND CURRENT LAW BY PERMITTING PHARMACISTS TO ADMINISTER CLIA WAIVED TESTS WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS AND TO NOTIFY THE PATIENT'S POSITION OF ANY OF NORMAL RESULTS. IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICIAN THE PHARMACIST WILL PROVIDE THE PATIENT WITH A LIST OF PHYSICIANS CLINICS OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WE EXPAND PROXIMITY TO CARE PREVENTION AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISEASE AND THAT WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND LENGTH OF LIFE WHILE REDUCING ECONOMIC BURDENS AMENDMENTS AND VIP THIS TEST THAT PHARMACISTS WILL NOT PERFORM.
