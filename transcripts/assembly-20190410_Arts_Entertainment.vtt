NONTRADITIONAL SPORTS.

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.772
IS THAT WOMEN ARE PAID

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.340
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN MEN

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:25.977
ACROSS THE BOARD AND IN --

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.045
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS --

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:29.614
VERY -- IMPORTANT STATE LANDS

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.582
COMMISSION DECISION THAT

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.217
REQUIRED THE MAVERICKS SURF

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.053

CHAMPIONS AND THIS WAS A GAME

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:41.226
CHANGER SO OUR BILL IS ELOQUENT

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:42.094
IN ITS SIMPLICITY.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.995
IT SAYS IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE

00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:45.864
GIVEN A LAND USE PERMIT OR A

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.166

PAY EQUITY FOR MEN AND WOMEN

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:51.503
DIVISIONS.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.906
AND THAT IS SO SIMPLE AND IT IS

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:57.242
SO ELOQUENT AND I THINK IT'S

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:58.710
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:01.079
THAT WE CODIFY THIS DECISION.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.081
INTO STATE LAW BECAUSE THIS WILL

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:04.616
AFFECT NOT ONLY THE SURFING

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.952

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:12.958
ON STATE LANDS.

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:15.227
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT IT I THINK

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:17.629
OUR ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS IN THE

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.564
STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO LOOK

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:20.966
TO THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS I

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:23.401
KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACKS.

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:24.936
THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:26.538
EQUALITY EQUITY IN ALL FORMS AND

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.940
I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT.

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.842
THESE ATHLETES COMPETE ON OUR

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.844
STATE LANDS THIS IS WHERE THEY

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:35.413
WORK THIS IS WHERE THEY COMPETE

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.816
RESERVOIR PERFORM THERE'S WHERE

ALLOW.

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.421
PAY IN EQUITY AND SO THIS BILL

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:46.558
CODIFIES A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLE.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.260

AND IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING

00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:59.390
QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED BECAUSE

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:00.524

SLIGHTLY TO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.456
POSITIONS LIKE SURFING IS NOT

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:33.991
THE ONLY SPORT THAT COULD BE

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.326
HELD IN A PUBLIC LAND SO THAT'S

00:41:35.392 --> 00:41:36.994
CORRECT SO IF IF THE BILL WAS

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.662
CRAFTED SO THE BILL'S NOT JUST

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.231
BEING CRAFTED FIRST FOR SURFING.

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.432
SO ASSUMING THAT THERE COULD BE

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:42.600
BECAUSE IS A STATE WIDE THIS

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.868
COULD BE ANY PUBLIC LAND IT

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.469
MIGHT NOT BE A COASTAL PUBLIC

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:46.403
LAND IT COULD BE COMPLETELY

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.504
OTHER SPORTS.

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.273
WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH SOMETHING

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.341
WHERE A SPORTING EVENT COULD DO

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:52.610
OF MAN AND MAN AND A WOMAN EVENT

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.078
OR JUST AN OPEN EVENT FOR

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:56.413
WHOEVER IT COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.616
THAT SPORT SO IN CYCLING I WOULD

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:00.284
SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE NEEDS

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.318
TO BE.

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:04.321
A MEN'S DIVISION OR CATEGORY AND

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.056
A WOMEN'S CATEGORY OR DIVISION

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.158
AND THERE WOULD BE A MEN'S RACE

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.793
OR A WOMEN'S RACE OR SUGGEST

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.362
THEN THAT THE BILL.

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.930
ACTUALLY LIST EVERY ALL THE

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:15.266
DIFFERENT SPORTS AND THEN SAY

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.634
WHETHER OR NOT AN OPEN.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.903
CATEGORY WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.371
FOR THAT SPORT AS OPPOSED TO A

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.505
SEPARATE MEN BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.507
SPORTS WHERE WOMEN ACTUALLY WANT

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:27.578
TO COMPETE.

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:28.746
WITH THE MEN IN AN OPEN --

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:29.813
COMPETITION WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.447
SPORTS LIKE THAT THAT ARE HELD

I DON'T KNOW THE LIST OF ALL THE

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.487

PROFESSIONALLY ON PUBLIC LANDS

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:03.113
LEAKS THAT WANT TO PLAY WITH

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.581
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SAME

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:09.019

THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN'T COMPETE

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.267
AGAINST MEN BECAUSE IF THEY DO

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.535
THAT THEY WON'T WIN AND THEY

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:25.869
WON'T GET THE PRIZE MONEY THAT

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.905
THEY NEED. TO FURTHER THEIR

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.406

WANTING TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.517
EXPENSE AND CUTTING THE WOMEN'S

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.752
EVENTS OUT OF THEIR PROGRAMS.

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.320
AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.055
NOT YOUR INTENTION BUT IT COULD

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.390
BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.092
FAR AS I SEE IT AND INTENT

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.226
LANGUAGE ISN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.761
TO STOP SOMEONE HAS TO THERE HAS

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.129
TO BE A STRONGER WAY OF MAKING

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.430
SURE THAT THAT'S PROHIBITED.

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:41.331
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:42.866
POLICE EVERY EVENT ACROSS THE

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:45.302
STATE IN EVERY -- STATE LAND SO

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.603
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.638
KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.673
ADDRESS AS YOU MOVE THE BILL

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.875
FORWARD -- I DO THINK THAT THERE

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.243
SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.745
TO DO THE MIX STANDARD EVENTS IN

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.180
CERTAIN SITUATIONS ONE THAT'S

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.315
APPROPRIATE I PLAY PROFESSIONAL

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.018
SPORTS IN A SPORT WHERE WOMEN DO --

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:03.020
NOW ARE NOW BEGINNING TO PLAY ON

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:04.354
EQUAL FOOTING WITH MEN CERTAINLY

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.989
NOT EVERY WOMAN NOT EVERY

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.124
CATEGORY BUT WE HAVE SOME WOMEN

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.091
THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BREAK

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.092
THROUGH AND WANTED TO PLAY WITH

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.360
THE MEN AND HISTORICALLY WE'VE

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:11.795
HAD A COUPLE OF WOMEN.

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:12.596
WHO WERE DENIED THE ABILITY TO

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.298
DO THAT SO I THINK WE'RE WE

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.332
DON'T WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:16.800
THAT WHEN SPORTS CAN BE

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:17.901
INTEGRATED IN THAT WAY THAT WE

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.836
DON'T STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.438
THAT WE HELP ENCOURAGE THAT?

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.606
SO THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OF

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:23.874
WRITING THAT IN WHEN IT'S

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:26.877
APPROPRIATE FOR CERTAIN AREAS --

00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:28.178
BUT AS SOMEONE WHO DID PLAY ON A

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:30.047
PROFESSIONAL LEVEL I ABSOLUTELY

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:32.182
EXPERIENCE -- TO KIND OF THE

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.784
SHAME OF THE PAY AND EQUITY.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.086
AND OF ALWAYS BEING KIND OF THE

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:38.822
SECOND CLASS YOU KNOW JUST YOU

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.390
