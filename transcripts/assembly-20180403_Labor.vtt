00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:43.107 region:rollup2
FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT RESEARCH

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:44.709 region:rollup2
JUSTICE NOT SUBSIDE PORT.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:46.477 region:rollup2
WEEBLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:48.379 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE BIASES THAT ARE BUT

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:49.914 region:rollup2
BUILT BAKED INTO WORKPLACES AT

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.316 region:rollup2
TECH COMPANIES THAT SERVE TO

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:53.084 region:rollup2
AMPLIFY BIAS.

00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:55.053 region:rollup2
AND REINFORCE THE LACK OF WOMEN

00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:56.788 region:rollup2
IN TACT YEAR AFTER YEAR.

00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:58.389 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SECOND SIXTEEN DATA

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:59.590 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:01.526 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.528 region:rollup2
COMPUTING OCCUPATIONS. AND THIS

00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:05.296 region:rollup2
IS A DROP FROM EARLY NINETIES

00:41:03.528 --> 00:41:06.764 region:rollup2
DATA THAT SHOWS THAT WOMEN WERE

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:08.666 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT SO

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:10.535 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DROP IN WOMEN'S

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:11.869 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION INTACT. THAT'S

00:41:10.535 --> 00:41:13.371 region:rollup2
BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THE

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.905 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETIES WHEREAS IT'S

00:41:13.371 --> 00:41:15.540 region:rollup2
BEEN AN INCREASE IN OTHER

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:17.675 region:rollup2
FIELDS.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.177 region:rollup2
WHAT WE LOOK FOR SPECIFIC DATA

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:21.779 region:rollup2
ON TACK

00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:22.981 region:rollup2
I IN THE SILICON VALLEY? THAT

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:24.048 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT REALLY

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.483 region:rollup2
READILY AVAILABLE BECAUSE

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:27.151 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GENERALLY VOLUNTARILY

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:29.654 region:rollup2
GIVEN. BUT.

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:30.922 region:rollup2
OR REQUIRED BY E. OC BUT

00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:32.957 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC COMPANIES SUCH AS

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:34.692 region:rollup2
GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK MICROSOFT

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:36.527 region:rollup2
TWITTER EXCEDRIN. OFTEN

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:38.262 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARILY REPORT OF THEIR

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:39.797 region:rollup2
GENDER AND OTHER DIVERSITY

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:41.032 region:rollup2
METRICS AND WOMEN MAKE UP

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:42.333 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:43.901 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO CLOSE TO FIFTY

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.502 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THEIR OVERALL WORK

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:45.837 region:rollup2
FORCE.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:47.772 region:rollup2
YET THE ONLY HOLD BETWEEN

00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:49.574 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY SEVEN

00:41:47.772 --> 00:41:51.109 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF TECHNICAL ROLES.

00:41:49.574 --> 00:41:53.111 region:rollup2
WITHIN THESE COMPANIES AND WOMEN

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:54.746 region:rollup2
HOLD BETWEEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT

00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:56.347 region:rollup2
AND THIRTY PERCENT OF LEADERSHIP

00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:57.548 region:rollup2
ROLE THAT THESE COMPANIES.

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.983 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN RESEARCH BY

00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:00.218 region:rollup2
ANITA BORG A

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.819 region:rollup2
IT'S THE THREE SILICON VALLEY

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:03.221 region:rollup2
TECH COMPANIES FOUND THAT THE

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:05.089 region:rollup2
BIGGEST AREA OF GROWTH FOR WOMEN

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:06.557 region:rollup2
INTACT WITHOUT THE ENTRY LEVEL

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:08.326 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS TWENTY TWO PERCENT AND

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:09.861 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THAT RISEN

00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:10.962 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE AND

00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:12.430 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:13.998 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THE PIPELINE IS IN

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.700 region:rollup2
FACT IMPROVING.

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:17.468 region:rollup2
BUT AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WOMEN

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.837 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:21.472 region:rollup2
AT THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE LEVELS.

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:23.641 region:rollup2
CONSISTING OF NINETEEN PERCENT

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:25.176 region:rollup2
AND FIFTEEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:26.844 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.912 region:rollup2
THE BEST WAY FOR WOMEN TO

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.747 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE THE CULTURE OF THESE

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:31.649 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS. AND TECH MORE

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:34.652 region:rollup2
BROADLY IS BY INCREASING THE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:36.320 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION IN LEADERSHIP.

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:37.722 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE SURPRISING IS THAT

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.524 region:rollup2
WOMEN WORKING IN TECH COMPANIES

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:41.159 region:rollup2
LEAVES AT TWICE THE RATE OF

00:42:39.524 --> 00:42:42.560 region:rollup2
THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES.

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:44.095 region:rollup2
FORTY ONE PERCENT OF WOMEN WILL

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.430 region:rollup2
LEAVE TECH AT MID CAREER

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:47.098 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO ONLY SEVENTEEN

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.332 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF MEN.

00:42:47.098 --> 00:42:49.567 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF FEMALE ATTRITION AND

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.969 region:rollup2
TECH IS HIGHER THANOTHER STEM

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:53.271 region:rollup2
FIELDS SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:54.972 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT ALL SCIENCES

00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.274 region:rollup2
SUFFER FROM BUT SOMETHING ABOUT

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:58.209 region:rollup2
TECH IN PARTICULAR.

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:59.811 region:rollup2
MANY QUALITATIVE STUDIES SUGGEST

00:42:58.209 --> 00:43:01.312 region:rollup2
THAT MANY WOMEN DON'T FEEL

00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:02.847 region:rollup2
WELCOME OR INCLUDED IN TACK

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:04.348 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD FROM MALE MANAGERS

00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:05.783 region:rollup2
WHOSE ALL MAIL ME MALE

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:07.518 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING TEAMS WILL SAY THEY

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:09.387 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DO NOT WANT TO HIRE

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:11.222 region:rollup2
WOMEN ONTO THEIR TEAMS. AS THEY

00:43:09.387 --> 00:43:12.423 region:rollup2
SERVICE A BUZZ KILL OR AS ONE

00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:14.592 region:rollup2
WOMAN I HEARD FROM IN A FOCUS

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:16.727 region:rollup2
GROUP STATED SHE COULD CARE LESS

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.962 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL BENEFITS.

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:19.430 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OFFERED AT TECH

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:21.699 region:rollup2
COMPANIES SUCH AS GO CARTS ARE

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.934 region:rollup2
PING PONG TABLES AND INSTEAD

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:25.736 region:rollup2
WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT MATERNITY

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:27.438 region:rollup2
LEAVE AND LACTATION ROOMS.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:29.307 region:rollup2
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE IN OUR WORK

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:31.008 region:rollup2
WITH ACTUAL TECH COMPANIES WERE

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:31.509 region:rollup2
TESTING A CHANGE MODEL THAT'S

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:33.311 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON A SMALL WINS

00:43:31.509 --> 00:43:34.245 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:36.247 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS RATHER THAN

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:37.782 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING LARGE SCALE DENY

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:39.317 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES WE RECOMMEND THAT

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:40.952 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:42.453 region:rollup2
START OFF SMALL RUNNING TEAM

00:43:40.952 --> 00:43:44.755 region:rollup2
BASED INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:45.957 region:rollup2
DISRUPT THE BIASES THAT ARE

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.158 region:rollup2
HURTING WOMEN AND OTHER UNDER

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:49.093 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED MINORITIES

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:51.229 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:52.797 region:rollup2
R. CHANGE MODEL IS FAIRLY SIMPLE

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:55.299 region:rollup2
STARTING OFF TO WORK WITH TEAMS

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:57.435 region:rollup2
OF MANAGERS TO CO DEVELOP TOOLS

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:59.170 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO REDUCE BIAS.

00:43:57.435 --> 00:44:00.972 region:rollup2
IN SPECIFIC EVALUATIVE PROCESS

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.573 region:rollup2
HE'S SUCH AS HIRING PERFORMANCE

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:03.941 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS OUR TALENT ABUSING

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:06.577 region:rollup2
CALIBRATIONS.

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:08.179 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE DIAL WOMEN AND

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:09.580 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES TEND

00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:12.083 region:rollup2
TO GET LOWER RATINGS AND THEN

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.151 region:rollup2
THAT IN TURN HURTS THEIR CHANCES

00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:15.353 region:rollup2
OF MOVING UP THE LADDER. FIRST

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.321 region:rollup2
MANAGERS NEED TO BE EGGED

00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:18.689 region:rollup2
EDUCATED ON STEREOTYPES AND

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:20.725 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:22.927 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN RECOGNIZE BIAS AND

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:24.228 region:rollup2
AVOID BUILDING IT INTO NEW TOOLS

00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:26.264 region:rollup2
AND PROPHECIES.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:28.399 region:rollup2
SECOND ORGANIZATIONS IN NEED TO

00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:30.168 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THEIR DIVERSE CITY DATA

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:31.702 region:rollup2
MANY COMPANIES WE TALKED TO

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:33.538 region:rollup2
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WOMEN WERE

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:34.906 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ARE

00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:36.641 region:rollup2
FALLING OUT OF THEIR PIPELINE.

00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:37.508 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW AT WHAT LEVEL

00:44:36.641 --> 00:44:38.910 region:rollup2
WOMEN ARE STE.

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:41.245 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT HAVING SERIOUS

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:43.014 region:rollup2
RETENTION PROBLEMS SO WE REALLY

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:45.349 region:rollup2
TOUGH ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS OF

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:46.984 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO KNOW WHERE WOMEN AND

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.653 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:49.987 region:rollup2
ARE IN THEIR COMPANY WHERE

00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:51.422 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FALLING OUT AND WHAT

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:52.924 region:rollup2
WHERE THEN THEY NEED TO MAKE

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.926 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCERTED EFFORTS ON

00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:57.161 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY RATHER THAN TRYING TO

00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:58.763 region:rollup2
DO. A SHOTGUN APPROACH.

00:44:57.161 --> 00:45:00.498 region:rollup2
NEXT TO WORK OF MANAGERS TO

00:44:58.763 --> 00:45:01.799 region:rollup2
THEN DEVELOP A TOOL THAT CAN

00:45:00.498 --> 00:45:02.300 region:rollup2
SPEAK THE PROCESS WERE BIAS

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:04.302 region:rollup2
APPEARS TO BE IMPACTING

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.437 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:08.406 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAVE

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:10.875 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR OR AMBIGUOUS CRITERIA

00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:12.843 region:rollup2
AROUND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.

00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:14.712 region:rollup2
THAT IS LEADING TO MEN AND WOMEN

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.912 region:rollup2
BEING EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY.

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.515 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:19.517 region:rollup2
THEY CAN WE CAN WORK WITH THEM

00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:21.452 region:rollup2
TO MAKE MUCH CLEARER CRITERIA

00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:23.020 region:rollup2
THAT IS BET METRIC BASED RATHER

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.956 region:rollup2
THAN BASED ON.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.724 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:28.226 region:rollup2
OR THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.527 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUAL IS CAPABLE OF

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.995 region:rollup2
RATHER IT'S BASED ON HARD

00:45:29.527 --> 00:45:32.597 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OR METRICS OF

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:33.831 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:36.133 region:rollup2
THEN THIS INTERVENTION OCT AND

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:37.735 region:rollup2
TOOLS ARE STE DESIGNED TO SERVE

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:39.604 region:rollup2
AS A MEASURABLE CHANGE THAT

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.905 region:rollup2
MANAGERS CAN THEN SEE. AND BE

00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:42.473 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED BY IN THE HOPES THAT

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.675 region:rollup2
THEY'LL WANT TO DO MORE TO ROOT

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:46.110 region:rollup2
OUT BIAS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.845 region:rollup2
CREATE BETTER PROPHECIES.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.981 region:rollup2
FINALLY WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:51.616 region:rollup2
OF THE CHANGE OR INTERVENTION

00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:53.050 region:rollup2
OFTEN SHOWING MEN AND WOMEN SAY

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.418 region:rollup2
RECEIVING SIMILAR FEEDBACK OR

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:56.387 region:rollup2
SHRINKING THE SIGNIFICANT GENDER

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:58.422 region:rollup2
GAP IN PERFORMANCE RATINGS THAT

00:45:56.387 --> 00:46:00.625 region:rollup2
HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. AND THIS

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:03.060 region:rollup2
CAN GIVE MANAGERS A FEELING OF.

00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:04.562 region:rollup2
EXCITEMENT AND FEELING THAT

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.097 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE CHANGE

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:08.132 region:rollup2
UP THEIR COMPANY AND THEY MIGHT

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:10.368 region:rollup2
THEN WE HOPE THAT THEY'LL THEN

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:11.669 region:rollup2
IT TALK TO OTHER MANAGERS ABOUT

00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:13.838 region:rollup2
THAT. INTRODUCE IT TO OTHER

00:46:11.669 --> 00:46:14.872 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES AND THEN THAT WILL

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:17.408 region:rollup2
LEAD TO.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:19.343 region:rollup2
A FEW CHANGES AT THE COMPANY

00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:20.878 region:rollup2
FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS SHARING

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:21.479 region:rollup2
THEIR AYE.

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:23.481 region:rollup2
IDEAS BECAUSE IT ALSO DOESN'T

00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:25.583 region:rollup2
RELY ON LEADERSHIP WHICH CHANGES

00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:26.183 region:rollup2
A LOT SO IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:28.085 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO'S COMMITTED TO THE

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:29.520 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. IF THAT PERSON LEAVES

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:31.188 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES DIVERSITY FALLS TO

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.923 region:rollup2
THE WAYSIDE.

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:34.392 region:rollup2
IN OUR RECENT WORK WITH GO DADDY

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:36.193 region:rollup2
WE WORKED WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE

00:46:34.392 --> 00:46:37.662 region:rollup2
LEADERS TO SIMPLIFY THEIR VALUES

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:39.163 region:rollup2
AND CREATE A SCORECARD THAT

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:40.197 region:rollup2
MANAGERS COULD USE WHEN MEETING

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:42.266 region:rollup2
IN CALIBRATING EMPLOYEE

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:44.335 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE. RATINGS THAT AFFECT

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:45.636 region:rollup2
PAY AND PROMOTION DECISIONS

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:47.238 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THE SCORECARD

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:48.839 region:rollup2
REQUIRED CREATING MEASURABLE

00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:50.207 region:rollup2
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:52.143 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT WERE ALIGNED WITH

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:53.277 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY'S VALUES. AND COULD

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:54.645 region:rollup2
BE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:56.547 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.715 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE CONSISTENCY IS ONE OF

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:59.083 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST WAYS MANAGERS CAN

00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:01.285 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT ALL EMPLOYEES

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:03.287 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF GENDER RACE ARE

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:05.289 region:rollup2
BEING EVALUATED AGAINST THE SAME

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:07.191 region:rollup2
CRITERIA. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:08.759 region:rollup2
BEING IN THE MERITOCRACY THAT WE

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:10.027 region:rollup2
ALL WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WITHIN

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.195 region:rollup2
TACK.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.863 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THE SCORECARD

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:14.732 region:rollup2
PRODUCED IMMEDIATE REDUCTIONS IN

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:16.867 region:rollup2
THE GENDER GAP PREVIOUSLY FOUND

00:47:14.732 --> 00:47:18.569 region:rollup2
IN PERFORMANCE RATINGS USED IN

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:20.304 region:rollup2
PROMOTION DECISIONS AND THIS

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:22.173 region:rollup2
TYPE OF A SMALL WHEN AS WE HAVE

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:23.341 region:rollup2
SHOWN CAN MOTIVATE FURTHER

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:25.576 region:rollup2
ACTIONS THAT LEAD TO LARGER

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:27.011 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION.

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:28.145 region:rollup2
SUCH AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:30.414 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY ADOPTING SIMILAR

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:32.283 region:rollup2
CRITERIA FOR THEIR EVALUATIONS.

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:33.584 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS MAKING A CONCERTED

00:47:32.283 --> 00:47:34.652 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO HIGH MORE HIRE MORE

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:36.987 region:rollup2
WOMEN AMONG THEIR NEW

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:38.322 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING GRADUATE HIRES.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:39.657 region:rollup2
THERE WERE MANY NAY SAYERS IN

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:41.292 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY AND LEADERS WHO

00:47:39.657 --> 00:47:42.827 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO BE BROUGHT ALONG BUT

00:47:41.292 --> 00:47:44.762 region:rollup2
IN THE END AS IS USUALLY THE

00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:46.163 region:rollup2
CASE. PARTICIPATING LEADERS

00:47:44.762 --> 00:47:47.531 region:rollup2
REPORTED FEELING THAT TAKING

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:50.468 region:rollup2
THOSE EXTRA FEW MINUTES TO

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:52.703 region:rollup2
CLARIFY CRITERIA. MADE THEM

00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:55.639 region:rollup2
BETTER MANAGERS MADE THEM BETTER

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:57.007 region:rollup2
OF MORE MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:58.442 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THEY WERE EVALUATING

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:59.844 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FAIRLY WHICH WAS THEIR

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:01.379 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE GOAL AS A MANAGER IN

00:47:59.844 --> 00:48:03.080 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE.

00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:04.982 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROUD TO SHOW THAT THROUGH

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.450 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL AND MANAGEABLE CHANGE

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:08.085 region:rollup2
ACCOMPANY LIKE GO DADDY WHO HAD

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.220 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY BEEN BEEN KNOWN FOR

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:11.288 region:rollup2
ITS SEXIST TELEVISION

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.057 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALS. IS NOW INCLUDED ON

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:14.558 region:rollup2
LISTS OF THE BEST COMPANIES FOR

00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.860 region:rollup2
WOMEN TO WORK FOR.

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:17.428 region:rollup2
THEREFORE AS AN INSTITUTE WE

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.796 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT CHANGE IS POSSIBLE

00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:20.197 region:rollup2
BUT THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE ON

00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:21.799 region:rollup2
CREATING TRULY MERITOCRATIC

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:24.001 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES WERE ALL PEOPLE

00:48:21.799 --> 00:48:25.603 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF GENDER. TRULY HAVE

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:26.704 region:rollup2
AN EQUAL CHANCE OF SUCCESS

00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:28.005 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLY BY REDUCING THE

00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:30.241 region:rollup2
AFFECTS OF BIAS IN THE

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:35.880 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT TRUE CHANGE AND

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:37.014 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY IN TECH WILL OCCUR.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.150 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DOCTOR WINNER.

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:40.885 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO NOT HEAR FROM MS

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.586 region:rollup2

MAKE AN IMPACT IN OUR BEAUTIFUL

00:48:58.135 --> 00:49:02.106 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.774 region:rollup2
AYE CURRENTLY AND THE DIRECTOR

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:05.142 region:rollup2
OF AN INSTITUTE CALLED THE

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:07.077 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING.

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:09.213 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND CULTURAL

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.680 region:rollup2
COMPETENCE WHICH IS BASED AT THE

00:49:09.213 --> 00:49:11.582 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.384 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. IN THE VITERBI

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:15.319 region:rollup2
SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING.

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:18.088 region:rollup2
AND THE WORK THAT I DO THERE WAS

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:19.423 region:rollup2
BORN OUT OF MY RESEARCH ON.

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.924 region:rollup2
ACADEMICALLY HIGH ACHIEVING

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:22.092 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE

00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:24.061 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:25.663 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OTHER SO MUCH RESEARCH

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:27.598 region:rollup2
ON WHAT'S NOT WORKING.

00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:29.200 region:rollup2
WITHOUT POPULATION.

00:49:27.598 --> 00:49:31.502 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS IN

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.104 region:rollup2
FACT WORKING AND SO I'VE NOW

00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:35.506 region:rollup2
PARTLY MY RESEARCH TO WORKING IN

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:37.308 region:rollup2
THE ENGINEERING SCHOOL. TO

00:49:35.506 --> 00:49:39.109 region:rollup2
PROVIDE OUTREACH TO MIDDLE

00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:40.611 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GIRLS WHO ARE AFRICAN

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.979 region:rollup2
AMERICAN AND LATINA. FROM

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.479 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED LOW INCOME

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.881 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:45.416 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:45.816 region:rollup2
AND SOME HERE TO TALK TO YOU A

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:47.518 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:49.553 region:rollup2
.

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:51.322 region:rollup2
SOME OF MY RESEARCH FINDINGS AND

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:54.058 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:54.558 region:rollup2
A SCENE WORKING SINCE WE WANTED

00:49:54.058 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
USE AND HOT ASSET BASED

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:59.296 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.997 region:rollup2
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:02.233 region:rollup2
INSIDE LIKE TO.

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:04.468 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT ONE ISSUE THAT IS OF

00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:08.339 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED AND AS

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:09.540 region:rollup2
OTHER FOLKS HERE MENTIONED. A

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.242 region:rollup2
GROCER JUST AS.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
CAPABLE IN GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE

00:50:11.242 --> 00:50:14.879 region:rollup2
JUST AS CAPABLE AND IN FACT

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:17.481 region:rollup2
MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS ARE JUST AS

00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:19.383 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN STEM AS BOYS ARE.

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:20.618 region:rollup2
BUT THERE TENDS TO BE A DROP OFF

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:22.386 region:rollup2
EIGHTH GRADE NINTH GRADE WHERE

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:24.989 region:rollup2
THEY JUST.

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:27.124 region:rollup2
GO FROM LIKING MATH LIKING

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:28.292 region:rollup2
SCIENCE LIKING TECHNOLOGY AND

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:30.294 region:rollup2
THEY LOSE ALL INTEREST.

00:50:28.292 --> 00:50:30.928 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE SOME.

00:50:30.294 --> 00:50:32.930 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION HERE TO SHARE WITH

00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:34.632 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:36.233 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REALLY IN MY RESEARCH

00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:39.069 region:rollup2
I FOUND THERE'S THREE REASONS

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:41.772 region:rollup2
WHY. THERE'S THIS DROP OFF.

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:43.474 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:45.676 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT REASONS IS.

00:50:43.474 --> 00:50:47.912 region:rollup2
THE GIRLS FEEL AND EXPRESS

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:49.613 region:rollup2
A LACK OF.

00:50:47.912 --> 00:50:52.116 region:rollup2
CONNECTION A LACK OF RELEVANCE

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:53.484 region:rollup2
TO THEIR DAILY LIVES.

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:54.685 region:rollup2
SURE THEY ALL HAVE IPHONES BUT

00:50:53.484 --> 00:50:57.421 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T THEY MAY NOT SEE THE

00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:59.056 region:rollup2
VALUE. OF HAVING THAT KNOWLEDGE

00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:00.724 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY CAN YOU BE A

00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:02.359 region:rollup2
CONSUMER OF THAT IPHONE YOU CAN

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:03.961 region:rollup2
ALSO BE A PRODUCER TECHNOLOGY

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:05.129 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE THAT I.

00:51:03.961 --> 00:51:07.197 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL ISSUE

00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:08.299 region:rollup2
A LACK OF RELEVANCE.

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:11.101 region:rollup2
SECONDLY.

00:51:08.299 --> 00:51:13.537 region:rollup2
IN THE RESEARCH IT STATES THAT.

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:15.005 region:rollup2
THERE'S A. THERE'S A REAL ISSUE

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:16.807 region:rollup2
AROUND GIRLS HAVING WHAT'S

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:19.209 region:rollup2
CALLED A FIXED MINDSET.

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:21.178 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY SAY I'M JUST NOT GOOD

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:23.180 region:rollup2
AT THAT I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH?

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:24.848 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THOSE FIX MINDSET

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.817 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS ARE. DETERMINED

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:27.785 region:rollup2
BY STEREOTYPES

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:29.620 region:rollup2
AND GROWTH SUCCUMBING. TO THOSE

00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:30.721 region:rollup2
STEREOTYPES

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.522 region:rollup2
GIRLS AND GIRLS OF COLOR IN

00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:33.190 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:35.693 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:37.194 region:rollup2
ARE SUSCEPTIBLE

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.796 region:rollup2
TO THE THAT MINDSET WHICH REALLY

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:40.931 region:rollup2
IS.

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:41.799 region:rollup2
SCOURGING AND CAN DISTRACT THEM

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.901 region:rollup2
FROM EVEN HAVING THAT.

00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:45.202 region:rollup2
A.

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:47.004 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SELF OR VIEW ABOUT

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:48.606 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SELF AS BEING A

00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:50.207 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIST SO THAT SECOND.

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:51.308 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:53.177 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES SUPPORTED

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:53.944 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY BY THEIR SCHOOL AN

00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:56.046 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC SETTING.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:59.216 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:51:56.046 --> 00:52:01.452 region:rollup2
AND THIRD THERE'S A LACK OF

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:04.154 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:06.190 region:rollup2
TO EXPLORE. AND MAKE MISTAKES

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:08.225 region:rollup2
TINKER BUILD AGAIN.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:09.693 region:rollup2
SO.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:11.595 region:rollup2
AND AS MY.

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:13.731 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IN AS A

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:14.798 region:rollup2
RESEARCH OF MANY OTHER RESEARCH

00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:17.735 region:rollup2
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE AND OTHERS

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:19.236 region:rollup2
HAVE SHOWN. I'M THERE'S WAYS TO

00:52:17.735 --> 00:52:20.471 region:rollup2
WORK COLLABORATIVELY.

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:23.007 region:rollup2
TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE

00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:24.541 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:26.276 region:rollup2
AND ONE MODEL I WANNA HIGHLIGHT

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:28.145 region:rollup2
IS.

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:29.313 region:rollup2
PRODUCT OF MY RESEARCH.

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.648 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY ABOUT BRINGING

00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:32.282 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS TOGETHER THAT EXIST

00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN THE AND THE

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:35.986 region:rollup2
RESEARCH BUT BRING IT TOGETHER

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:37.321 region:rollup2
FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.323 region:rollup2
FEMALE STEM ENTREPRENEURS OF THE

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:41.592 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:45.429 region:rollup2
BASED ON NUMBER ONE ENCOURAGING

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:47.364 region:rollup2
IN FEMALE STUDENTS OF COLOR.

00:52:45.429 --> 00:52:49.700 region:rollup2
AND AFFIRMS.

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:50.634 region:rollup2
FUND OF KNOWLEDGE.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.169 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS IT COMES FROM

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:54.538 region:rollup2
ANTHROPOLOGY?

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:56.040 region:rollup2
BUT THE TERM MEANS.

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:57.808 region:rollup2
HELPING STUDENTS AFFIRM THEIR

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.309 region:rollup2
SOCIO CULTURAL THEIR LINGUISTIC

00:52:57.808 --> 00:53:00.978 region:rollup2
BACKGROUNDS.

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:03.180 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY KNOW PLACING THEM IN

00:53:00.978 --> 00:53:03.781 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF EXPERTS?

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.282 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:07.651 region:rollup2
STEM.

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:09.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE VERY CLEAR

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:10.454 region:rollup2
WAY TO HELP THEM SEE THE

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:12.523 region:rollup2
RELEVANCE.

00:53:10.454 --> 00:53:13.123 region:rollup2
OF STEM

00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:14.558 region:rollup2
THE DIRECT RELEVANCE TO THEIR

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:16.093 region:rollup2
LIVES.

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:17.995 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY INCREASING THEIR

00:53:16.093 --> 00:53:19.730 region:rollup2
GROWTH MINDSET.

00:53:17.995 --> 00:53:22.633 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY CAN SEE I MAY NOT

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:25.169 region:rollup2
BE GOOD AT MATH RIGHT NOW.

00:53:22.633 --> 00:53:27.538 region:rollup2
BUT HONESTLY WHOEVER WAS IN THE

00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:29.673 region:rollup2
BEGINNING LIKE NO AND RIGHT.

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:31.475 region:rollup2
EVEN MATHEMATICIANS YOU NO I

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:33.010 region:rollup2
WORKING AT USC AND I MEET REALLY

00:53:31.475 --> 00:53:34.845 region:rollup2
SMART FOLKS.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:36.580 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE LEADING INITIATIVES

00:53:34.845 --> 00:53:38.816 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE MYSELF.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:39.850 region:rollup2
IN MATH AND ENGINEERING IT'S

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:42.019 region:rollup2
ULTRA AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.454 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO IT'S

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:45.389 region:rollup2
REALLY ABOUT STRESSING THE VALUE

00:53:43.454 --> 00:53:46.824 region:rollup2
A FAILURE. IN THE VALUE OF

00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.459 region:rollup2
MAKING MISTAKES AND IT'S OKAY.

00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:49.526 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRD GIVING THEM HANDS

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:52.062 region:rollup2
ON OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY AND

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:53.931 region:rollup2
EXPLORE.

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:58.068 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO

00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:58.669 region:rollup2
MOVE FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE.

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.471 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:53:58.669 --> 00:54:02.606 region:rollup2
TO.

00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:05.576 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE NEEDS NOT ONLY OF

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:06.143 region:rollup2
THE CHILD'S BUT ALSO THE

00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:07.211 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY FIND

00:54:06.143 --> 00:54:09.747 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:11.749 region:rollup2
AND THE FAMILY STRUCTURE.

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup2
SO BY GIVING CONTENT PROVIDING

00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:14.952 region:rollup2
CONTENT TO.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:16.620 region:rollup2
THE YOUNG GIRLS THEMSELVES BUT

00:54:14.952 --> 00:54:18.522 region:rollup2
ALSO ENGAGING THEIR PARENTS IN

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.390 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS.

00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:22.392 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A STEM FAMILY.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:23.660 region:rollup2
SO IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL.

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.962 region:rollup2
WE ALL SEE PARENTS GOING TO

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.830 region:rollup2
BASEBALL GAMES

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:29.099 region:rollup2
SOCCER GAMES.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.868 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHY COULDN'T WE SEE

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:33.771 region:rollup2
MORE PARENTS SUPPORTING THESE

00:54:30.868 --> 00:54:35.806 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING. CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU

00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:37.875 region:rollup2
KNOW THESE MATH OLYMPICS JUST AT

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:40.043 region:rollup2
THE SAME LEVEL RIGHT.

00:54:37.875 --> 00:54:41.979 region:rollup2
I AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:44.915 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU. A LITTLE.

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:47.584 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL. EXAMPLE.

00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:48.785 region:rollup2
SO BRING THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.854 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE GROWTH

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:51.855 region:rollup2
MINDSET IN HANDS ON LEARNING.

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:53.991 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE CONTENT FOR MIDDLE

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:56.360 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GIRLS OF COLOR.

00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:56.960 region:rollup2
A LAST SUMMER. I HAD A GREAT

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.262 region:rollup2
SUCCESS I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.164 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:54:58.262 --> 00:55:02.032 region:rollup2
THEIR ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRLS AND

00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:03.367 region:rollup2
EACH SUMMER WE WORK ON A

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:05.102 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING

00:55:03.367 --> 00:55:07.471 region:rollup2
GRAND CHALLENGE.

00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:08.672 region:rollup2
SO LAST YEAR'S CHALLENGE WAS

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:11.375 region:rollup2
IMPROVE URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:12.009 region:rollup2
WHETHER ELEVEN SO YOU HAVE TO

00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:13.677 region:rollup2
SAY IT LIKE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:15.279 region:rollup2
IT SO. WE SAY IMPROVE YOUR

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:17.514 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:55:15.279 --> 00:55:19.249 region:rollup2
SO FIRST STEP WAS PLACING THEM.

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:20.017 region:rollup2
IN THE ROLE OF EXPERTS

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:22.452 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE FUNDS OF

00:55:20.017 --> 00:55:24.688 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE ASKING THOSE GIRLS

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:25.756 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.256 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE DIFFERENT WHAT DO

00:55:25.756 --> 00:55:28.292 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE.

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:29.960 region:rollup2
SECONDLY GIVING THEM THE HANDS

00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:31.261 region:rollup2
ON TOOLS SO IN THIS CASE IT WAS

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.262 region:rollup2
OUT DEVELOPMENT.

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:35.265 region:rollup2
AND THEN GIVING THEM GROWTH

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:36.600 region:rollup2
MINDSET TRAINING SO THEY CONCEDE

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.167 region:rollup2
THAT THROUGH EFFORT AND YOUR

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.868 region:rollup2
MISTAKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.169 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:41.638 region:rollup2
WELL THE WINNING TEAM THE

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:43.707 region:rollup2
OUTCOME THERE ELEVEN YEARS OLD.

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:46.276 region:rollup2
AND THESE GIRLS MADE AN ANTI

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:48.845 region:rollup2
HUMAN TRAFFICKING UP.

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:49.413 region:rollup2
THAT WORKED AT A GEO LOCATION

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.681 region:rollup2
IT'S READY TO GO ON THE APP

00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:51.014 region:rollup2
STORE.

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:52.883 region:rollup2
IT'S READY FOR

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:54.351 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALIZATION.

00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:55.819 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE PRODUCT OF

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.987 region:rollup2
PLACING GIRLS AND THE ROLE OF

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.456 region:rollup2
EXPERTS.

00:55:56.987 --> 00:56:00.724 region:rollup2
IN THEIR WORLDS.

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:02.025 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE TOOLS AND

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:04.194 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY ARE NO LONGER A

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:05.495 region:rollup2
HINDRANCE

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.096 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO THEY'RE JUST THAT

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:06.697 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.632 region:rollup2
TOOL.

00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:09.633 region:rollup2
TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.

00:56:08.632 --> 00:56:12.135 region:rollup2
THEY'RE YOUNG GIRLS BUT THEY

00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:15.038 region:rollup2
HAVE LOTS TO SAY AND SO. THIS IS

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:16.573 region:rollup2
ONE WAY I BELIEVE TO REALLY.

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:19.009 region:rollup2
HELP UNDERSERVED GIRLS AND

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:20.043 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS.

00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:20.944 region:rollup2
FIND THEIR WAY IN TECHNOLOGY AND

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:23.180 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THEM.

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:24.715 region:rollup2
SO.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.984 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO SAY

00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:28.685 region:rollup2
THERE'S ROOM TO SCARE ALL.

00:56:26.984 --> 00:56:30.254 region:rollup2
THERE'S ROOM TO COLLABORATE.

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.722 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS IS

00:56:30.254 --> 00:56:33.557 region:rollup2
SO SO VERY CRITICAL THAT WE'RE

00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
ALL HERE TALKING.

00:56:33.557 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ACADEMICS BUT.

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:41.164 region:rollup2
POLICY LEADERS.

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:42.232 region:rollup2
LEADERS IN THE K. TWELVE SPACE.

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:44.434 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TECH LEADERS WHO ARE

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:46.770 region:rollup2
GOING TO SPEAK.

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:47.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BY WORKING TOGETHER. AND

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.474 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE FUNDS OF

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF OUR POPULATIONS.

00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:54.344 region:rollup2
AN INCREASING A AND OUT TIGHT

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:56.446 region:rollup2
FOR GROWTH MIND SADDENED WITH

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:57.581 region:rollup2
TRIAL YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:58.448 region:rollup2
OF THIS GAME AND STAY IN IT.

00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:00.317 region:rollup2
AND THEN GIVING PEOPLE THE

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:02.185 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TOUCH THINGS AND

00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:04.187 region:rollup2
EXPLORE I THINK WE REALLY ARE ON

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:08.225 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT PATH TO MAKING SOME

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:10.861 region:rollup2
CRITICAL CHANGES THANK YOU.

00:57:08.225 --> 00:57:13.497 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DR FLOWERS TAYLOR VERY

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:14.064 region:rollup2
MUCH OUT OF THEM TEND TO THE

00:57:13.497 --> 00:57:15.832 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE IT'S IF

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:18.168 region:rollup2
THERE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:19.836 region:rollup2
SOME OF COLOR BUT JUST I WANT

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:23.073 region:rollup2
THANK BOTH YOU A DOCTOR FLOWERS

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:23.941 region:rollup2
TAYLOR. AND IN REGARDS TO.

00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:26.109 region:rollup2
AND THE FOR THE I. E. C. THREE

00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:26.443 region:rollup2
MODEL. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.778 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT.

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:29.646 region:rollup2
.

00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:31.281 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:33.317 region:rollup2
IN NOTHING STIR IT YOU HIT ON A

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:35.419 region:rollup2
LOT OF THEM NOTHING WE'VE HEARD.

00:57:33.317 --> 00:57:36.753 region:rollup2
THINK THE ON STEREOTYPES FOR

00:57:35.419 --> 00:57:40.424 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THAT IT DOESN'T LOT OF

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:43.560 region:rollup2
SOCIETAL ISSUES STARTS EVEN IN

00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:44.461 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY OFTENTIMES.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.796 region:rollup2
RIGHT WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS

00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:46.430 region:rollup2
ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS

00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.998 region:rollup2

ACCESS TO HANDS ON STEM LEARNING

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.569 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES I SEE IT YOU KNOW

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:54.204 region:rollup2
YOU GO TO MIDDLE SCHOOLS.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:55.305 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU LOOK AT EITHER OF

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:57.808 region:rollup2
THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ARE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:59.509 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIES. YOU'LL SEE

00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:01.178 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A SUCH A SCIENCE FAIR OR

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:02.112 region:rollup2
A ROBOTICS COMPETITION IS PRETTY

00:58:01.178 --> 00:58:03.814 region:rollup2
MUCH EVEN SPLIT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:05.916 region:rollup2
AND THEN HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR

00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:08.585 region:rollup2
SENIOR YEAR THE SAME. ACTIVITIES

00:58:05.916 --> 00:58:11.922 region:rollup2
AS ALMOST ALL BOYS RIGHT AND SO

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:13.523 region:rollup2
I I I HAVE SEEN AND ADORED ME

AGAIN.

00:58:16.126 --> 00:58:18.762 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS ON.

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:20.430 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT A TECH CAMPS LARA

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:21.231 region:rollup2
SCIENCE COUNTS NOW THAT A LOT OF

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.566 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING ABOUT THE

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.533 region:rollup2
PARENTS GOVERNMENT AND THE

00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:25.869 region:rollup2
REALLY EXPENSIVE.

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:27.270 region:rollup2
AND SO. ALL AND SOME OF THEM

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:29.573 region:rollup2
ARE FOCUSING ON WHAT NOT ON

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.907 region:rollup2
GIRLS. AND YOUNG GIRLS AND AND

00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:33.610 region:rollup2
AND YOUNG LADIES AND WOMEN.

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:35.479 region:rollup2
AT THEM BUT STILL ON THE ACCESS

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.047 region:rollup2
IS IN THERE I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:37.781 region:rollup2
DOING HOW DO WE SKILLED THAT IN

00:58:37.047 --> 00:58:40.917 region:rollup2
PARTNERING WITH OUR TECH

00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:42.386 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SO THAT EVERY. YOUNG

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:43.420 region:rollup2
GIRL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:58:42.386 --> 00:58:44.855 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.390 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:47.457 region:rollup2
I REALLY APPRECIATE.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:48.358 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ASKING

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:51.161 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:52.796 region:rollup2
MONETARY CONCERNS I MEAN THAT'S

00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:54.064 region:rollup2
A REAL HUGE ISSUE.

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:55.932 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:58.935 region:rollup2
BIGGEST.

00:58:55.932 --> 00:59:00.771 region:rollup2
AREAS AND. FOR COLLABORATION.

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:02.472 region:rollup2
I'M HONESTLY I THINK

00:59:00.771 --> 00:59:03.740 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TECH LEADERS

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:05.342 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT ACADEMIA IN

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:07.144 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WE HAVE A

00:59:05.342 --> 00:59:08.812 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO THOSE KIDS.

00:59:07.144 --> 00:59:10.614 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:59:08.812 --> 00:59:12.716 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR.

00:59:10.614 --> 00:59:15.052 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SOME SUPPORT.

00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:16.186 region:rollup2
RIGHT ARM WEEKEND GREATLY BY

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.521 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THOSE KIDS WITH THIS

00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:20.457 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:22.426 region:rollup2
SO WHY NOT INVEST IN THAT IT'S A

00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:24.161 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE IN DEVELOPMENT.

00:59:22.426 --> 00:59:25.228 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AND IT'S NOT IT'S

00:59:24.161 --> 00:59:25.796 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IT IN THAT

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:28.965 region:rollup2
CONTEXT IS NOT A SHORT TERM

00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:30.400 region:rollup2
GAIN.

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:32.335 region:rollup2
IT'S A LONG TERM GAIN SO WE HAVE

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.803 region:rollup2
TO INVEST IN THE LONG TERM AND I

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.971 region:rollup2
THINK I SPEAKING AS A

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:36.506 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:38.108 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REPRESENTATIVE I THINK

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:39.209 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNIVERSITY WE HAVE A

00:59:38.108 --> 00:59:40.644 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE

00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:42.679 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND THAT COULD MEAN

00:59:40.644 --> 00:59:43.747 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIPS THAT COULD MEAN.

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:45.715 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:47.117 region:rollup2
THAT COULD MEAN PROVIDING LOW IN

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.952 region:rollup2
FREE RESOURCE OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:50.287 region:rollup2
COLLABORATING WITH SCHOOLS AND

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:52.222 region:rollup2
TECH LEADERS TO ACTUALLY.

00:59:50.287 --> 00:59:53.757 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO

00:59:52.222 --> 00:59:55.859 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THAT ORDINARILY WOULD

00:59:53.757 --> 00:59:58.028 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I LIKE

00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:59.329 region:rollup2
THREE FOUR FRAMED AS WORKFORCE

00:59:58.028 --> 01:00:00.797 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT FOR BOTH.

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.832 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT AND

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:03.266 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:05.602 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS FOR THE

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.736 region:rollup2
TECH SECTOR AS OPPOSED TO

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.171 region:rollup2
CHARITY.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:09.973 region:rollup2
YOUNG THIS OF NOT SO THAT AS AN

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:11.341 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.342 region:rollup2
I WILL MEET WHEN WE TALK ON THE

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.643 region:rollup2
TERMS IN WHICH YOU'RE TALKING

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.377 region:rollup2
ABOUT AS A THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:16.513 region:rollup2
AND AND DOCTOR WIENER.

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:19.282 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF THE WORK FORCE

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:21.651 region:rollup2
BOTH HIRING AND RETENTION. THERE

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:24.554 region:rollup2
WAS A BILL LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:26.089 region:rollup2
VETOED BY MISS A VICE A MEMBER

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.224 region:rollup2
EXHAUST FLETCHER. THAT WOULD

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.659 region:rollup2
REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS.

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:32.295 region:rollup2
NEED TO DISCLOSE SPECIFIED INFO

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:34.931 region:rollup2
ON GENDER WAGE DIFFERENTIALS TO

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.332 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.133 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:39.069 region:rollup2
I'M WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:41.004 region:rollup2
KNOWING NUMBERS IS EXTREMELY

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:42.572 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THE MORE TRANSPARENCY

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:44.374 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT THESE COMPANIES

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup2
THE BETTER BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:49.146 region:rollup2
IT JUST BECOMES A. ISSUE OF WELL

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:52.015 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.716 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE DOING ALL THESE

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.684 region:rollup2
EFFORTS BUT?

01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:56.186 region:rollup2
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:58.555 region:rollup2
ANYTHING IS ACTUALLY PRODUCING

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:59.823 region:rollup2
CHANGE WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:01.158 region:rollup2
WORKING ARTS NOT WORKING OR IS

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.926 region:rollup2
JUST WINDOW DRESSING FOR OR NOT

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.261 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PRODUCING ANY CHANGE SO

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:07.731 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEFINITELY.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:10.233 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS OF MORE TRANSPARENCY

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:11.201 region:rollup2
IN DIVERSITY NUMBERS AND WHAT

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.069 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:18.308 region:rollup2
IS HAPPENING WITHIN TECH

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:18.909 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

ABOUT.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:36.927 region:rollup2
HOW TO EXPAND THOSE HANDS ON

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:32.309 region:rollup2
RESPECTIVE IN SOME ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:33.243 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAD A PROBLEM. THAT WAS

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.211 region:rollup2
AFFECTING THE USERS OF OUR

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:37.380 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:39.382 region:rollup2
BUT IMAGINE BEING BLACK AND NOT

BEING SELECTED FOR AIRBNB BASED

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.620 region:rollup2
NICOLE OF YOUR SKIN.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:45.088 region:rollup2
OR BEING GAY AND SHOWING UP TO

AN AIR BEING BEING BEING TOLD

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.489 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY YOU CANNOT STAY IN MY

HOME.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.792 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE BUILT A PLATFORM

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.292 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.727 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL BUYERS ON THAT

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.961 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:53.096 region:rollup2
SO CONCURRENT LEADS TO THE WORK

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:54.331 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING INTERNALLY

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.165 region:rollup2

A PLATFORM.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:15.852 region:rollup2
WE MADE A BOLD STATEMENT IN LATE

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:17.554 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO OUR

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:20.323 region:rollup2
ENTIRE COMMUNITY BASICALLY

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:21.658 region:rollup2
STATING THAT IF YOU DO NOT.

WE'LL LEAVE AND THE

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:24.961 region:rollup2
UNDERPINNINGS OF WHY WE EXIST WE

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:26.463 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT ONE A PLATFORM AND

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:27.731 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE DID LEAVE. SOME

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:29.899 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FRANKLY LEFT THE PLATFORM

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:32.502 region:rollup2
SAYING I WANT TO LET ANYONE IN

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:33.703 region:rollup2
MY HOME BUT I CHOOSE TO BE MY

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:36.306 region:rollup2
HOME VERSES WHO USE AN

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.640 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION SAY CAN BE A MILE.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.008 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS TOUGH BUT WE REALLY

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.143 region:rollup2
DID HAVE A PLAYBOOK.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.378 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NOT A COMPANY OUT

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.846 region:rollup2
THERE IT REALLY ADDRESS THIS

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.147 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE HEAD ON.

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.849 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:47.183 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF CHATTER OF IT YOU

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.017 region:rollup2
TOLD THE WORLD WE YOUR IS A

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.586 region:rollup2
COMPANY THAT WAS A SUPERBOWL

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.187 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL ETCETERA BUT WOULD

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:52.422 region:rollup2
YOU DOING INSIDE. THE

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:54.791 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

YOU ADVANCE DIVERSITY CONSTRUCTS

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.593 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION THE

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.260 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.962 region:rollup2
A THE FIRST THING WE DID FRANKLY

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:00.397 region:rollup2
WAS BUILT AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:02.332 region:rollup2
AND DIVERSITY TEAM.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:04.100 region:rollup2
SO THE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE GOING

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:05.468 region:rollup2
BACK TWO YEARS THERE IS NOW AN

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.403 region:rollup2
EVERGREEN TEAM IN PLACE WHOSE

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:09.038 region:rollup2
JOB IT IS TO LOOK AT OUR

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.539 region:rollup2
PLATFORM DALY. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.273 region:rollup2
WERE EXTRACTED BY SUMMER

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:12.442 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:14.043 region:rollup2
BUT INCLUDES ENGINEERS DATA

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:15.211 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS PEOPLE GLOBALLY

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:17.113 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:19.549 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHO'S BEING

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:20.850 region:rollup2
ACCEPTED. WHO'S NOT WHY IN IF

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.252 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PROBLEMS MAKING SURE

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:23.753 region:rollup2
WE ADDRESS THEM IN A RADICALLY

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.021 region:rollup2
BIAS IN THE PLATFORM WE FIND OUT

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.423 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTS.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.791 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY THERE IS A A GROUP OF

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.392 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:30.794 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY ON THE DIVERSITY AND

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:32.295 region:rollup2
BELONGING TEAM BUT FOR ME IT'S

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:33.396 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:35.031 region:rollup2
S. GALVANIZING THE ENTIRE

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:36.699 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:38.468 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.035 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY AS AN ORG.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.770 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:42.439 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IS TO ATTRACT BY SOME

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS PERFORMANCE REVIEWS

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.308 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PEOPLE PRACTICES THAT

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.910 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD FROM MY CLAIMING

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.677 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE EARLIER.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.312 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A DIVERSE CANDIDATES

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.612 region:rollup2
SLATE SIN IN PLACE WHICH IS

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.781 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.483 region:rollup2
THE ROONEY RULE THAT THE NFL

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:55.351 region:rollup2
ADOPTED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:57.320 region:rollup2
STATING THAT WE MUST HAVE

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:59.289 region:rollup2
DIVERSE SLATES OF CANDIDATES OR

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.324 region:rollup2
INSIGHTS ONE SITE FOR INTERVIEWS

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.592 region:rollup2
AND IF NOT. YOU NEED TO GO BACK

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:05.261 region:rollup2
AND FIND THAT DIVERSITY AND IS

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:06.496 region:rollup2
AN ALGORITHM USED TO DEFINE

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:07.564 region:rollup2
WOULD ADVERSELY IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.832 region:rollup2
I WE HAVE TRAINING THAT ARE IN

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.400 region:rollup2
PLACE WHICH LIKELY MADONNA.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:12.035 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.570 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WHICH A LOT OF

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:14.904 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING. ROSSO

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.806 region:rollup2
DOING ALLY SKILLS TRAININGS

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:17.507 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.042 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK IS REALLY

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:20.910 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:22.745 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE DIVERSE CONSTRUCTS AND

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:24.180 region:rollup2
TO ALL TRAININGS. SO DIVERSITY

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:26.082 region:rollup2
TRAININGS ARE NOT SEEN AS THIS

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.451 region:rollup2
ONE OFF THING OVER HERE WERE YOU

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:29.652 region:rollup2
TAKEN UNCONSCIOUS BY TRAINING

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.620 region:rollup2
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE OKAY.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.522 region:rollup2
YOU'RE FREE OF BIAS AND YOU'RE

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.556 region:rollup2
GOOD TO GO MAKING SURE THAT ALL

OF OUR TRAININGS WE'RE LOOKING

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.992 region:rollup2
AT ALL OVER TRAINS TO MAKE SURE

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.627 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DIVERSE CONSTRUCTS

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.828 region:rollup2
EMBEDDED. IN THAT BUYS IS

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.830 region:rollup2
EXTRACTED.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:43.366 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS WE

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.400 region:rollup2
ARE WE DO PULL SURVEYS AN ANNUAL

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:46.002 region:rollup2
SURVEYS OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.003 region:rollup2
I WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN QUESTIONS

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.805 region:rollup2
GEARED DIRECTLY TOWARDS

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:50.206 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY IN BELONGING.

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:51.541 region:rollup2
AND FOR YEARS FOR THE FIRST

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:53.309 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS AGO IN THAT SURVEY

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:55.011 region:rollup2
THE DIVERSITY RESPONSES WERE

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.713 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:58.414 region:rollup2
BUT THESE WERE NOTS OF THE MOST

01:06:56.713 --> 01:07:00.283 region:rollup2
DIVERSE POPULATIONS RESPONDING

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:02.185 region:rollup2
TO THE SURVEY SO THIS PAST YEAR

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:03.553 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE TOOK THAT

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:04.954 region:rollup2
SURVEY DATA AND BROKEN DOWN BY

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:06.689 region:rollup2
RACE

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:08.324 region:rollup2
GENDER AND ETHNICITY AND WE

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.926 region:rollup2
SOLVE CHALLENGES.

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:11.027 region:rollup2
WE SAW THAT BLACK EMPLOYEES DID

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:12.629 region:rollup2
NOT FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG TO ANY

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:14.130 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION TO THE SAME LEVEL

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.265 region:rollup2
THAT WHITE EMPLOYEES DID. THAT

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.966 region:rollup2
WOMEN DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:18.768 region:rollup2
BELONG TO THE SAME LEVEL THAT

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:20.336 region:rollup2
MEN DO. SO MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:22.205 region:rollup2
TAKE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE PRACTICES

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:23.940 region:rollup2
AND BREAK IT DOWN BY ALL THE

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:26.042 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.443 region:rollup2
TO ALSO INCLUDE EQUAL PAY.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.479 region:rollup2
EQUIPED HOUSES WE DO ANNUALLY

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:30.880 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE TOLD OUR EMPLOYEES IF

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:32.482 region:rollup2
WE SEE ANY GAPS WE WILL ADDRESS

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.783 region:rollup2
THOSE ACCORDINGLY. BUT ONE THING

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:36.386 region:rollup2
WE STARTED ON THIS PAST YEAR IS

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:37.520 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE. THAT WE LOOK AT

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.255 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY AND RACE

AS WELL AS GENDER I THINK WE ALL

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:42.592 region:rollup2

THAT MENTORSHIP PROGRAM WAS

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.825 region:rollup2
PILOTED WITH OUR EMPLOYEE

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:30.026 region:rollup2
RESOURCE GROUPS

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.561 region:rollup2
OF WHICH IT'S A VERY DIVERSE

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.762 region:rollup2
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:34.063 region:rollup2
WILL GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.664 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION AS WE MOVE

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.032 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT BEYOND TWO THOUSAND

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.966 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN.

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:38.668 region:rollup2
AND THAT EMPLOYER RE SCORE

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:40.303 region:rollup2
SOURCE GROUP SPACE WE HAVE

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:42.305 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN GROUPS TOTALING FIFTEEN

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:43.906 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MEMBERS. AND THOSE

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:45.308 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE TIED TO A SENIOR

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.775 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATION MOVING FORWARD.

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.048 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:53.416 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP EARLIER THAN I'D LIKE

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:55.351 region:rollup2
TO JUST TOUCH UPON BEFORE WE

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.986 region:rollup2
HAVE A FEW NAY LATER. IS ARE

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:58.321 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN SPACE.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.789 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:01.023 region:rollup2
THAT QUITE OFTEN HAPPENS WITH

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.992 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS IS PLAYING WHAT I

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:04.594 region:rollup2
CALL THE DIVERSITY OLYMPICS.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:07.663 region:rollup2
QUITE OFTEN ORGANIZATIONS LOOK

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
AT WOMEN WOMEN IN TECH FIRST.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.466 region:rollup2
AND THEN SECONDARILY BLACK LET

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:13.169 region:rollup2
NEXT BOB RELATIONS

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:14.737 region:rollup2
AND THEN MAYBE LGBTQ MAYBE

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.638 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND I THINK

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.405 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF MAKING

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:19.108 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:19.709 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS CONCURRENTLY. AND

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.077 region:rollup2
THERE WERE NOT PITTING GROUPS

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:22.278 region:rollup2
AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT WE'RE

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:23.045 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE INTERSECTION AUDI

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.248 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE GROUPS BRING TO THE

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.616 region:rollup2
TABLE. AS BEING THE LEADING

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:28.584 region:rollup2
VOICE SO TO SPEAK AS OPPOSED TO

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.018 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCES THOSE GROUPS

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.419 region:rollup2
BRING TO THE TABLE.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.322 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY IN MERGERS AND

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.424 region:rollup2
ACQUISITIONS ARE QUITE OFTEN IF

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:37.293 region:rollup2
WE ARE LOOKING. AT OTHER

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:39.362 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE THOSE

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.896 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:40.963 region:rollup2
THAN OUR EXISTING COMPANY

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:42.365 region:rollup2
AIRBNB.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:45.501 region:rollup2
AND TYPICALLY LESS DIVERSE SO

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:46.736 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HAVE. OF THOUGHTFUL

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.370 region:rollup2
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WHILE

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.704 region:rollup2
TAKING DIVERSITY IN

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.705 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IS UNDOUBTEDLY A

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.773 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.774 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING I TOUCHED UPON

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:53.242 region:rollup2
EARLIER WAS EXPANDING OUR

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:54.310 region:rollup2
EFFORTS GLOBALLY.

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.312 region:rollup2
BUT GLOBALLY FOR ME FRIENDLY

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.014 region:rollup2
MEANS OUTSIDE OF THE BAY.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:59.582 region:rollup2
OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:01.184 region:rollup2
WITH EMPLOYEES AND IN NEW YORK

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:02.618 region:rollup2
LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:04.020 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN SEATTLE WHICH LOOKS

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.655 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN LONDON LOOKS

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN SOUTH AFRICA. SO

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:08.291 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HAVE GLOBAL

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.726 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.960 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT DIVERSITY THAT VARY BY

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:14.463 region:rollup2
REGION.

I WILL THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:24.473 region:rollup2
MEETING TODAY THINK IT'S SUCH AN

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:26.008 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP TO TAKE THAT. A

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
PERSONAGE OF TO HAVE THESE KINDS

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.678 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSATIONS AND I CAN BRING

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:29.278 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:30.813 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN EARLY STATE START

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.714 region:rollup2
UPS ARE REDUCED TO AND A HALF.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:33.583 region:rollup2
YEARS IN WE HAVE LESS THAN

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:35.151 region:rollup2
TWENTY EMPLOYEES BUT I'VE KIND

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.719 region:rollup2
OF BEEN ON BOTH ENDS SO I WENT

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:37.820 region:rollup2
TO UC DAVIS FOR UNDERGRAD. SO

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:39.322 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN A RECIPIENT OF

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.790 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IN EXPANDING MY MIND

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:42.491 region:rollup2
SET TO NOW BE WHERE I AM TODAY

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.893 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW A LOT OF MY FOCUS IS

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:46.329 region:rollup2
ON. ENCOURAGING IN ADVANCING

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:50.600 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITIES AND

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:52.134 region:rollup2
STEM. SO I AM ALSO THE FOR A CAN

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.802 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THE FOUNDING CO CHAIRS

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.136 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL BE

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:58.407 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED LATER ON TODAY. BUT MY

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.642 region:rollup2
START UP IS DURING THE THAT AND

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:01.410 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEALTH TECH COMPANY

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:03.713 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE EDUCATION GAP

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:06.782 region:rollup2
BETWEEN AND PHYSICIANS AND

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:07.416 region:rollup2
PATIENTS. INTERMETALLIC G..

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:08.050 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED ARE

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.885 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY I REALLY HONESTLY

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.719 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT RECRUITMENT AND

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.187 region:rollup2
RETENTION WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.188 region:rollup2
THAT JUST CAME REALLY NATURALLY

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:13.723 region:rollup2
HOME I WAS NAIVE. IT ACTUALLY

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:14.690 region:rollup2
TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND FOCUS

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.591 region:rollup2
ON BUT IT'S REALLY JUST BUILT

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.492 region:rollup2
INTO MY DNA SO I THINK FROM THE

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.994 region:rollup2
GET GO WITHOUT A CULTURE AND

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:19.161 region:rollup2

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:21.163 region:rollup2
MAKE IT AN AND WELCOMING

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:24.066 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AND TO ME THAT MEANS

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:25.167 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY FOR IT NO MATTER

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.602 region:rollup2
WHO'S WHAT SOMEBODY'S BACKGROUND

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:28.104 region:rollup2
IS TO BE ABLE TO COME IN. HAVE

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:30.373 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO RESOURCES ON GROWTH

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:31.707 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AND ENGAGEMENT WE

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:33.309 region:rollup2
DO THINGS LIKE INSTEAD OF GOING

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.844 region:rollup2

THERE'S TWENTY SCHOOLS IN THE

01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:24.359 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M

MAKERS SPACES DUE TO THE WORK

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:30.031 region:rollup2
THAT HACKER LAB IS DONE.

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:32.200 region:rollup2
CODE FOR HOOD I'M GOES INTO.

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:34.669 region:rollup2

AND WE DO HACKATHONS WORKSHOPS

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:39.741 region:rollup2
AND BOOT CAMPS WE OFFER AFTER

01:29:36.638 --> 01:29:42.310 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ON SERVICES AS WELL AND

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:43.979 region:rollup2
WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON. ON LOW

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:45.380 region:rollup2
INCOME AND CHILDREN OF COLOR

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:46.848 region:rollup2
ITEM AND OFFER THEM A QUALITY

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.750 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:49.284 region:rollup2
FOR THREE YEARS NOW AND HAVE

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.920 region:rollup2
SERVED OVER TWO THOUSAND

01:29:49.284 --> 01:29:54.723 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. ON AND THIS IS THIS IS

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:57.325 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO AND IT IS VERY IT'S A

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:58.994 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH NEEDED. AYE AND.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:30:01.263 region:rollup2
MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES IN THESE

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:04.199 region:rollup2
AREAS AND IN REGARDS TO.

01:30:01.263 --> 01:30:04.900 region:rollup2
LACK OF EDUCATION IN STEM LACK

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:07.302 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES AND.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:08.236 region:rollup2
.

01:30:07.302 --> 01:30:10.205 region:rollup2
LACK OF PARENTAL SUPPORT AS FAR

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:11.506 region:rollup2
AS THEIR EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.475 region:rollup2
OF HOW IMPORTANT STEM IS FOR

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:15.610 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILDREN. ON IT STARTS AT

01:30:13.475 --> 01:30:16.411 region:rollup2
HOME AYE I DO SEE THERE'S A BIG

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:18.179 region:rollup2
BARRIER.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.414 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTS

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:20.181 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THINKING THAT THEIR

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.449 region:rollup2
CHILDREN CAN ACCOMPLISH THE

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:22.550 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ACTUALLY DOES

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:24.753 region:rollup2
STARTED HOME ESPECIALLY THE

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:26.054 region:rollup2
HISPANIC COMMUNITY COMING FROM A

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:28.556 region:rollup2
VERY BLUE COLLAR BACKGROUND.

01:30:26.054 --> 01:30:30.959 region:rollup2
ITEMS STATING FACTS LIKE OWE ME

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:31.559 region:rollup2
HOW YOU'RE SO. A YEAR SO YOU

01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:33.528 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE SUCH A BIG CHIN

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:35.363 region:rollup2
GOING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BECOME

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:37.065 region:rollup2
AN ENGINEER AND SO THEY ACTUALLY

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:38.033 region:rollup2
GET CHASTISED AND MADE FUN OF

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:39.601 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ONE ACTUALLY GO TO

01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:42.437 region:rollup2
COLLEGE YOU BECOME AN ENGINEER.

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:43.305 region:rollup2
OR BECOME AND ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:45.073 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER WHO WENT TO THE

01:30:43.305 --> 01:30:47.509 region:rollup2
MILITARY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:50.245 region:rollup2
TO COLLEGE TO BECOME AN AERONAUT

01:30:47.509 --> 01:30:51.613 region:rollup2
ERIC. ARROW NOT ACHE.

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.814 region:rollup2
I ENGINEER AND HIS FATHER

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:54.249 region:rollup2
TOTALLY LAUGHED AT HIM AND HE

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:55.884 region:rollup2
ENDED UP BECOMING.

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:57.485 region:rollup2
BOB MILITARY POLICE AND ARMY THE

01:30:55.884 --> 01:30:58.653 region:rollup2
HIGH PATROLMAN BUT HE WANTED TO

01:30:57.485 --> 01:31:00.255 region:rollup2
BE AN ENGINEER

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:02.424 region:rollup2
SO ON THESE THINGS ACTUALLY DO

01:31:00.255 --> 01:31:03.958 region:rollup2
STARTED HOME. THERE'S OF HUGE

01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:05.393 region:rollup2
LACK OF RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:06.895 region:rollup2
TO ON PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:08.530 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THE FUNDS

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:09.898 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS. THAT IS NEEDED TO

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:13.802 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING TO THESE THE

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:15.370 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND PERFORM EDUCATION ON

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.237 region:rollup2
IT. WHICH STEM CURRICULUM.

01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:17.539 region:rollup2
SO.

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:19.607 region:rollup2
WERE HOPING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:20.875 region:rollup2
TO ADD MORE RESOURCES AS WE GO

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:22.010 region:rollup2
WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORK

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:23.178 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET INTO THE FRIDGE

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:24.579 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CENTER SOMEWHERE IN

01:31:23.178 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2
SOUTH SACRAMENTO. SO WE ACTUALLY

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:28.049 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE A MAKERS SPACE FOR

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.317 region:rollup2
THE YOUTH IN THOSE AREAS ON

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:31.953 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM ALLEN

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:33.722 region:rollup2
LATER HE ACTUALLY TEACHES ON THE

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:35.824 region:rollup2
STUDENTS EVERY WEEKEND. ON I

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:37.425 region:rollup2
JUST I JUST DO THIS THING AND

COMMISSION OF MY INTEREST IN

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:03.518 region:rollup2
LOVE OF STEM EDUCATION AND

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:05.053 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY GIRLS AND

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:06.588 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH THAT WAS.

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:08.023 region:rollup2
BORN FROM MY TIME SPENT THE

01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:10.058 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ABOUT

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:11.292 region:rollup2
TWELVE YEARS THERE LAST SERVING

01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:12.861 region:rollup2
AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.928 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION AND LEARNING. UP I

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.263 region:rollup2
JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBER SO WHAT

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:17.032 region:rollup2
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY'S

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:18.233 region:rollup2
REALLY QUICK ABOUT GROUND ZERO A

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:19.934 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD BE IN THE HOME BUT

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:22.237 region:rollup2
ALSO IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:23.471 region:rollup2
THE DISPARITY. IN EQUITIES START

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:25.140 region:rollup2
REALLY YOUNG.

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.642 region:rollup2
IN COURSEWORK AND SO I KNOW

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:28.777 region:rollup2
THAT I PASSED OUT A A LITTLE

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.744 region:rollup2
POWER POINT AND YOU CAN'T SEE

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:32.447 region:rollup2
AND I APOLOGIZE BUT I'LL READ

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:33.214 region:rollup2
YOU WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE.

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:34.349 region:rollup2
.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.949 region:rollup2
WE'VE AYE AT THE AS THE

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:36.384 region:rollup2
COMMISSION OF THE SETTLEMENT

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:38.286 region:rollup2
GROWTH WE FOCUS ON STEM

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.821 region:rollup2
EDUCATION NOT. OF JUST BECAUSE

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:41.322 region:rollup2
OF MY INTEREST BUT THE ENTIRE

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.557 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS INTERESTED THROUGH

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.658 region:rollup2
OUR CO SPONSORSHIP FOR THE STEAM

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:45.794 region:rollup2
SYMPOSIUM WITH DEPARTMENT OF

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:47.095 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. OF AS WELL TOWN HALL

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:48.263 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT'S

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:50.065 region:rollup2
IN MY PRESENTATION BUT IF YOU

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:51.466 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SLIDE THREE. AND YOU

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:53.134 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA MALE TO

01:32:51.466 --> 01:32:54.636 region:rollup2
FEMALE STUDENT RATIOS WE COULD

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:56.838 region:rollup2
HAVE THE VERY SAME SORT OF

01:32:54.636 --> 01:32:57.972 region:rollup2
RATIOS BUT WORSE IF YOU COMPARED

01:32:56.838 --> 01:32:59.641 region:rollup2
TO UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH AND

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:01.242 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OF COLOR. SO WHAT WE'RE

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:03.344 region:rollup2
SHOWING HERE IS THAT THERE ARE

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:05.747 region:rollup2
GENDER STEREOTYPES EVEN AS EARLY

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:08.149 region:rollup2
AS K. TWELVE EDUCATION NOW THE

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:09.818 region:rollup2
RATIO OF MALES TO FEMALES TURNS

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:12.253 region:rollup2
OUT IT'S ONE POINT ZERO FOUR TWO

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:12.921 region:rollup2
ONE. SO THE SCIENCE IS ABOUT

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.022 region:rollup2
ACCURATE.

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:15.690 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT COMPUTER

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:17.058 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING I'VE BEEN STUDYING

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:18.726 region:rollup2
THIS FOR FOUR YEARS.

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:19.227 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS OUR CURRENT NUMBERS

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.795 region:rollup2
OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:33:19.227 --> 01:33:22.430 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:23.898 region:rollup2
IT'S TWO POINT SIX THREE TWO ONE

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:26.067 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ABOUT NUMBER SAYS

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:27.869 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL MORE THAN DOUBLE

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:29.370 region:rollup2
MALE TO FEMALE RATIO IF YOU LOOK

01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:30.972 region:rollup2
AT COMPUTER EDUCATION ABOUT ONE

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:32.340 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE SEVEN TO ONE.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:34.642 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING IS ONE POINT FIVE

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.610 region:rollup2
SEVEN ONE WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:37.045 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'VE.

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:38.413 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:39.514 region:rollup2
IS AND COMPUTER EDUCATIONAL LAST

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:42.050 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN CREWS ABOUT

01:33:39.514 --> 01:33:43.618 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND GIRLS IN COMPUTER

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:45.453 region:rollup2
EDUCATION? ENGINEERING WE'VE

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.321 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INCREASED ABOUT EIGHT

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.223 region:rollup2
THOUSAND GIRLS.

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:48.723 region:rollup2
OF SCIENCE IS ABOUT THE SAME

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:49.891 region:rollup2
WOULD ON AN INCREASE BUT

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:51.759 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONALLY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:53.361 region:rollup2
MORE ENROLLMENT AND STUDENT WITH

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:54.829 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND.

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:56.698 region:rollup2
MORE GIRLS A COMPUTER

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:58.500 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING HAS GONE FROM THREE

01:33:56.698 --> 01:34:01.102 region:rollup2
POINT ZERO SEVEN TO ONE THAT WAS

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:03.271 region:rollup2
FOUR YEARS AGO. TO TWO POINT SIX

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:04.706 region:rollup2
FIVE TO ONCE A WEEK THERE'S BEEN

01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:05.907 region:rollup2
ONLY A FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:07.842 region:rollup2
GIRLS INCREASE.

01:34:05.907 --> 01:34:09.244 region:rollup2
NOW THERE HAS ALSO TO DO WITH A

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:10.645 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED COURSES HAVE BEEN

01:34:09.244 --> 01:34:12.447 region:rollup2
CREATED LIKE INFORMATION

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:14.249 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES WHICH

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:15.550 region:rollup2
ARE SKEWED THAT THAT NUMBER

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:18.019 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO

01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:19.154 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IS THAT THOSE BIASES

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:21.089 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:23.057 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS FOR SUSPENSIONS AND

01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:24.592 region:rollup2
EXPULSIONS ONCE THOSE NAY IN

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:26.661 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS COME TO LIFE BY

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:28.229 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY. IT'S AMAZING HOW

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:30.098 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TAKE PAY ATTENTION RIGHT

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.698 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE I HAVE THESE

01:34:30.098 --> 01:34:35.436 region:rollup2
NUMBERS COURSE WORK SO WE CAN

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:37.272 region:rollup2
GET A

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:38.306 region:rollup2
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE

01:34:37.272 --> 01:34:39.841 region:rollup2
IT'S HAPPENING AND HOW EARLY

01:34:38.306 --> 01:34:41.176 region:rollup2
IT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF.

ALL BUT MYSELF BEING AN ENGINEER

01:41:50.972 --> 01:41:55.042 region:rollup2
I DON'T DEAL WITH THE WORDS I

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:57.478 region:rollup2
LIKE IT TO BE I DEAL WITH THE

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:58.346 region:rollup2

AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE HERE IN

01:41:58.346 --> 01:42:01.248 region:rollup2
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND WE NEED

THE KIDS WHO ARE WHO WHO BUILT

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:50.297 region:rollup2
OF WHO WHO BUILT ON ACT AND

01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:54.135 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:54.769 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FLASH AND SIZZLE WHEN

01:42:54.135 --> 01:42:56.437 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO TECH BUT FOR ME I'M

01:42:54.769 --> 01:42:57.071 region:rollup2
IN THE TREE.

01:42:56.437 --> 01:42:57.705 region:rollup2
I AM VERY THANKFUL TO THE TO

01:42:57.071 --> 01:42:59.607 region:rollup2
EFFORTS LIKE THE RAILS PROGRAM

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:00.741 region:rollup2
WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO A TWELVE

01:42:59.607 --> 01:43:01.909 region:rollup2
WEEK PROGRAMMING CLASS WITH

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:02.543 region:rollup2
QUEEN TICKET FOR RISKING THE

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:04.412 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE. ALTHOUGH BECAUSE

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:05.880 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THEM.

01:43:04.412 --> 01:43:06.781 region:rollup2
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.448 region:rollup2
WERE UNABLE TO MEET IN TIME I

01:43:06.781 --> 01:43:09.150 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

01:43:07.448 --> 01:43:10.551 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS YEAR BUT STILL THAT

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:12.520 region:rollup2
OF THAT GRANT HAS ALLOWED US TO

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:14.055 region:rollup2
PUT THAT NETWORKING EQUIPMENT

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.255 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY BUILDING

01:43:14.055 --> 01:43:15.122 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:43:14.255 --> 01:43:16.657 region:rollup2
SOME SOME NETWORKING

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:18.559 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY IS

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:20.027 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REALLY BIG THING SO I

01:43:18.559 --> 01:43:21.729 region:rollup2
MEAN I MEAN AT THE END THE DAY

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:23.931 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE GET THE

01:43:21.729 --> 01:43:24.498 region:rollup2
CASH OR NOT I'M GONNA KEEP DOING

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:25.766 region:rollup2
THIS FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.734 region:rollup2
BUT THE THING IS IS THAT.

01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:28.102 region:rollup2
REALLY TO HAVE THESE

01:43:26.734 --> 01:43:30.037 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I MEAN YOU CAN

01:43:28.102 --> 01:43:32.239 region:rollup2
LOOK AT JUST THE.

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:33.874 region:rollup2
IN THIS ROOM I MEAN AND I THINK

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:34.675 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POINT WHERE THE THING

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:36.711 region:rollup2
I LIKE ABOUT TEACHING KIDS IS

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:38.312 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT.

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:40.114 region:rollup2
NOBODY REALLY HE DISAGREES WITH

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:41.749 region:rollup2
IN THEORY BUT WHEN IT ACTUALLY

01:43:40.114 --> 01:43:43.417 region:rollup2
COMES DOWN TO WHAT IT COMES DOWN

01:43:41.749 --> 01:43:44.952 region:rollup2
TO GETTING TO IT WILL BE HARD TO

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:45.986 region:rollup2
DO AND AS YOU KNOW I CAN'T PAY

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:47.655 region:rollup2
MY RENT RIGHT NOW.

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:49.023 region:rollup2
SO.

01:43:47.655 --> 01:43:50.825 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS THE TAKE AWAY IS IS

01:43:49.023 --> 01:43:52.193 region:rollup2
THAT NOW THAT ONCE WE. ESTABLISH

01:43:50.825 --> 01:43:52.827 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT EQUITY WHILE THAT

01:43:52.193 --> 01:43:54.361 region:rollup2
IS THE GOLD IS NOT WE'RE GOING

01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:56.263 region:rollup2
TO GET TO. DEALING WITH THE

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:57.765 region:rollup2
WORLD CITY IS TECH DOESN'T

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:59.233 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE EXPERT.

01:43:57.765 --> 01:44:00.768 region:rollup2
ON THERE ARE A LOT OF OPEN

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:02.103 region:rollup2
SOURCE TOOLS OUT THERE THERE ARE

01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:05.005 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE AND IT

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:05.806 region:rollup2
IS FROM THAT. IT IS FROM THAT SO

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.374 region:rollup2
THAT BACKYARDS WHICH FROM I

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:08.642 region:rollup2
TEACH.

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.944 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE COMPUTERS ARGUES

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:11.245 region:rollup2
THAT PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY

01:44:09.944 --> 01:44:12.246 region:rollup2
LAPTOPS WHICH WE USED TO GOING

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:13.781 region:rollup2
INTO FIVE MOST OF THEM ARE

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.249 region:rollup2
SECOND HAND SOME OF THEM UP A

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:18.419 region:rollup2
LOT OF THEM. ARE PAID OUT OF MY

01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:19.520 region:rollup2
OWN POCKET SOME OF THEM SOME OF

01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:20.287 region:rollup2
OUR EQUIPMENT HAS A CAN MEAN

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.789 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:23.257 region:rollup2
TO WORK TO BUILD THAT THROUGH

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:24.825 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OF FUNDING THAT

01:44:23.257 --> 01:44:26.660 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOTTEN. ARM AND SO WE AND

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:27.228 region:rollup2
SO IT'S ALWAYS JUST AS ALWAYS

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.062 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN MY LIFE WITH THE

01:44:27.228 --> 01:44:29.396 region:rollup2
ATTITUDE THAT GOT ME THROUGH

01:44:28.062 --> 01:44:30.798 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT'S GOT ME THROUGH A

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:33.234 region:rollup2

THE BEST THAT I CAN WITH.

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:39.640 region:rollup2
BUT I'M I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:41.108 region:rollup2
A SHIFT IN HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.042 region:rollup2
STUFF BECAUSE HONESTLY WE ALWAYS

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.776 region:rollup2
WANT TO GET THE CHINESE NEW

SLAP AND HAVE THE KIDS IN THEIR

01:44:43.878 --> 01:44:46.046 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF TIMES WE NEED TO

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:47.014 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:48.916 region:rollup2

THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:30.984 region:rollup2
TECH THAT WAS A CO SPONSOR OF

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:31.885 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATION AB TWENTY THREE

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:34.788 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE PASSING TWENTY

01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:36.523 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN. AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:37.991 region:rollup2
WOMAN BO DNIA.

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.493 region:rollup2
WHICH CREATES A COMPUTER

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:41.094 region:rollup2
SCIENCE STRATEGIC ADVISORY BOARD

01:51:39.493 --> 01:51:42.563 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDER

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:44.431 region:rollup2
WAY AND WE HAVE ONE YEAR TO

01:51:42.563 --> 01:51:46.066 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHERE THE GAPS ARE

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:48.202 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE IN

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:49.069 region:rollup2
THE AREA OF THE UNDERSERVED

01:51:48.202 --> 01:51:51.238 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:52.973 region:rollup2
AND DIVERSITY EXPOSURE TO

01:51:51.238 --> 01:51:56.076 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENCE SO THAT'S AN

01:51:52.973 --> 01:51:58.712 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE BUT SORT OF THAT PROCESS

01:51:56.076 --> 01:52:01.448 region:rollup2
AND THAT GETS TO I'M CREATING

01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:04.051 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITIES.

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:06.687 region:rollup2
TEACHER TRAINING RESOURCES

CURRICULUM ENHANCEMENT.

01:52:06.687 --> 01:52:12.259 region:rollup2
INCREASE THINKING SOFT SKILLS

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:13.193 region:rollup2
THE LIST GOES ON AND THE FOURTH

01:52:12.259 --> 01:52:15.829 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THAT.

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:17.998 region:rollup2
IS DIVERSIFICATION IN THE

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:21.668 region:rollup2
SUPPLY CHAIN SO.

01:52:17.998 --> 01:52:22.970 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT VERIZON HAD ALLUDED

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:24.938 region:rollup2
TO THIS AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF

01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:26.540 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ALSO LOOK

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:29.009 region:rollup2
AT NOT ONLY THEIR OWN INTERNAL

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:29.676 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES BUT HOW ARE THEY

01:52:29.009 --> 01:52:32.346 region:rollup2
PARTNERING.

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:34.681 region:rollup2
ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WHAT

01:52:32.346 --> 01:52:38.285 region:rollup2
ARE THEIR THAT BEING THE SUPPLY

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:41.088 region:rollup2
CHAIN FOLKS BEST PRACTICES

01:52:38.285 --> 01:52:41.722 region:rollup2
AROUND DIVERSE CITY.

01:52:41.088 --> 01:52:48.929 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE SORT OF THE FOUR SO

01:52:41.722 --> 01:52:50.397 region:rollup2
IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA IN

01:52:48.929 --> 01:52:52.132 region:rollup2
WHICH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH MORE

01:52:50.397 --> 01:52:53.734 region:rollup2

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:56.703 region:rollup2
BETTER A BIGGER FLOW OF FUNDS

01:52:53.734 --> 01:52:57.804 region:rollup2
GOING INTO YOUR SCHOOLS. AND

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:58.772 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ALSO LEADS INTO THE

01:52:57.804 --> 01:53:01.275 region:rollup2
FAMILY DEMOGRAPHICS AS FAR AS

01:52:58.772 --> 01:53:03.110 region:rollup2
HOW ACTIVE THEY ARE BECAUSE WE
