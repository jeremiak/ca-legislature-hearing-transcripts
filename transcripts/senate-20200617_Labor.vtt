SECOND OF ALL- I DO HEAR AND

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:39.664
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A

02:25:39.730 --> 02:25:42.533
SEGMENT OF THE API COMMUNITY.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.469
EARLIER CHINESE AMERICANS WHO

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:48.773

TELL YOU I'M A FATHER I HAVE.

02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:54.479
CHILDREN I REMEMBER FLYING

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:57.115
COLLAGEN HEARING RUMORS ABOUT

02:25:57.181 --> 02:26:00.485
QUOTAS AND- CERTAINLY-

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:02.920
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

02:26:02.987 --> 02:26:03.855
APPLICANTS TO OUR- CHINESE

02:26:03.921 --> 02:26:07.525
AMERICAN. ASIAN SOME OF THAT

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:11.362
PERHAPS GROUNDED IN. HERE THEIR

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:13.030
MEDIUM DUTY BEEN SOME TRUTH TO

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:17.001
THAT. BUT IT WASN'T BECAUSE

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:20.538
BLACK OR BROWN APPLICANTS WE'RE

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:22.707
GOING TO TAKE AWAY MY SPOT THE

02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:25.209
FACT I WOULD SAY THAT

02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:27.145
REALISTICALLY IS GOING TO BE

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:30.148
THE ALUM FRIENDS OR THE WHO HAD

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:33.050
THE WHERE WITH ALL TO

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:36.354
PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN SUPPORT.

02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:39.624
THAT APPS WITH. RELIEVED CAN

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:42.293
AGAINST NOT BASED ON OUR MERITS

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.829
BUT BASED ON THEIR PRIVILEGE

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:48.032
AND WELL. AND SO CERTAINLY I

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:51.435
HERE'S THE FEAR THAT. SOME OF

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:54.405
THE- AT WHO ARE AND OPPOSITION-

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:55.973
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.842
OWN CHILDREN'S CHANCES OF

02:26:57.909 --> 02:26:59.944
GETTING A SO CALLED TOP SLOTS

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:03.014
ARE TOP COLLEGE AND BUT I THINK

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.649
WE NEED TO REALLY EXAMINE WHAT

02:27:04.715 --> 02:27:08.019
THE ISSUE IS WHEN IT COMES. THE

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:09.353
THING THAT I ALSO WANT TO

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:11.055
MENTION IS. I'M CERTAINLY I

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:12.490
THINK MANY OF US WANT TO

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.058
EMBRACE THIS IDEA OF A

02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:16.894
MERITOCRACY. BUT HOW DO YOU

02:27:16.961 --> 02:27:18.262
HAVE A MERITOCRACY WHEN WE HAVE

02:27:18.329 --> 02:27:20.565
STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND I WANT

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:23.334
TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:26.304
API COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OF ALL I

02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:28.873
THINK MANY OF US- EXPERIENCE NO

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:31.809
MATTER HOW MANY GENERATIONS OUR

PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ELECTED

FISH OF JUSTICE AND

02:48:04.073 --> 02:48:05.975

WERE LATER FOUND NOT GUILTY. I

02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:28.465
REMEMBER HOW DARRYL GATES

02:48:28.531 --> 02:48:29.899
PARADED HIS RACISM AND

02:48:29.966 --> 02:48:33.503
MISMANAGEMENT FOR ALL TO SEE.

02:48:49.552 --> 02:48:51.488
SIX. TODAY CALIFORNIA IS IT A

02:48:51.554 --> 02:48:55.558
SIMILAR CROSSROADS. JUST AS

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:56.192
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND

02:48:56.259 --> 02:48:56.793
NINETEEN NINETY TWO PEOPLE OF

02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:59.762

02:48:59.829 --> 02:49:00.930
LONG HISTORY OF

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:03.333
INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND

02:49:03.399 --> 02:49:05.001
POLICIES THAT SAY YOUR LIFE

02:49:05.068 --> 02:49:09.172
DON'T MATTER. JUST LIKE IN

02:49:09.239 --> 02:49:10.039
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN NINETEEN

02:49:10.106 --> 02:49:11.341
NINETY TWO. THE PEOPLE OF

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:13.510

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:15.078
RACISM. REJECTED

02:49:15.144 --> 02:49:17.146
INSTITUTIONALIZED OPPRESSION

02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:20.250
AND SAY. BLACK LIVES MATTER.

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:22.719
BROWN LIVES MATTER THE LIVES OF

02:49:22.785 --> 02:49:25.355
PEOPLE OF COLOR MATTER. TWENTY

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:27.624
TWENTY NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT.

02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:28.858
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US OF

02:49:28.925 --> 02:49:31.194
THAT SENATOR MITCHELL WE NEED

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:33.296
TO CHECK IMPLICIT BIAS IN

02:49:33.363 --> 02:49:35.765
INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN ALL

02:49:35.832 --> 02:49:38.001
AREAS OF OUR LIVES. WE NEED TO

02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:41.871
DO WHAT WE FAIL TO DO IN

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:43.673
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN NINETEEN

02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:44.741
NINETY TWO AND THREE HUNDRED

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:46.543
YEARS BEFORE THAT. I BELIEVE

02:49:46.609 --> 02:49:48.578
THAT A CA FIVE IS A SMALL PART

02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:50.914
CRUCIAL STEP. TOWARDS HEALING

02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:52.248
AND ADDRESSING THE DUBIOUS

02:49:52.315 --> 02:49:56.452
ASPECTS OF OUR STATES LEGACY. I

02:49:56.519 --> 02:49:57.153
BELIEVE IT SENDS THE MESSAGE

02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.354
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:00.590
MEET THIS. FREE ONE CALIFORNIA

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:02.792
YIELDED TO RACISM AND WHERE WE

02:50:02.859 --> 02:50:05.461
FAIL TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT. AND

02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:06.596
SHOULD THE VOTERS APPROVE AC

02:50:06.663 --> 02:50:09.098
FIVE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:50:09.165 --> 02:50:10.934
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. COULD

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.001
BE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:15.104
VERY IMPORTANT. CONFRONTING OUR

02:50:15.171 --> 02:50:17.740
STATE'S LEGACY OF RACISM AND

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:19.776
OPPRESSION AND BEGINNING THE

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.311
DIFFICULT PROCESS OF

02:50:21.377 --> 02:50:23.313
RECONCILIATION AND CHANGE YOU

02:50:23.379 --> 02:50:24.547
KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:26.649
ALL KIND OF PERSON ICE THESE

02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:28.818
ISSUES AS THEY COME BEFORE. I

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:30.620
LOOK AT MYSELF AFTER THE EVENTS

02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:32.388
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIDN'T

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:35.925
AND WITH ITS NINETEEN SIXTY

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:36.559
FIVE NINETEEN NINETY TWO OR TO

02:50:36.626 --> 02:50:38.328
SEEING WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT. IT

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:40.129
UNTIL THE- I FIND THAT I AM

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:42.899
TRULY GUILTY BECAUSE I THOUGHT

02:50:42.966 --> 02:50:44.901
EACH ONE OF THESE EVENTS. THAT

02:50:44.968 --> 02:50:47.236
LIFE WOULD CHANGE AFTER THAT IT

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.872
WAS AN ANOMALY IT WAS A BAD COP

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:52.308
HERE OR BAD OFFICER OR- THE

02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:53.876
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WERE

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:55.612
DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT

02:50:55.678 --> 02:50:57.480
REALLY WAS. THAT WE CAN LEARN

02:50:57.547 --> 02:50:59.749
FROM THESE ACTIONS AND WE'D SEE

02:50:59.816 --> 02:51:03.786
CHANGE. HI VANTAGE POINT. I

02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:07.023
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT.

02:51:07.090 --> 02:51:08.424
FORTUNATELY I GREW UP IN SAN

02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:10.093
FRANCISCO MY PARENTS WERE THE

02:51:10.159 --> 02:51:11.628
BEST THINGS THEY EVER GAVE ME

02:51:11.694 --> 02:51:13.763
WAS THAT CULTURAL DIVERSITY

02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:16.499
THAT I EMBRACED IT ENJOYED AND

02:51:16.566 --> 02:51:18.267
FELT THAT THAT'S HOW IT WAS

02:51:18.334 --> 02:51:21.671
EVERYWHERE. IT WAS AND OFTEN

02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:23.773
THOUGHT WHEN I WAS- PULLED OVER

02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:26.809
BY A POLICE OFFICER IN DRIVING.

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:27.977
THE COUPLE THINGS GO THROUGH MY

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:31.080
MIND FIRST ONE IS. HOW MY GONNA

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:34.984
TALK MY WAY OUT OF THIS. SECOND

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:38.655
AM I GONNA GO TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:40.289
OR AM I GOING TO PAY THE TAKE.

02:51:40.356 --> 02:51:42.625
THE AREA I WOULD HAVE TO. IN

02:51:42.692 --> 02:51:46.062
THE REAL WORLD A REAL PEOPLE

02:51:46.129 --> 02:51:49.699
FULL OF COLOR. SO I COULD FOR

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:51.067
ME I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE ONLY

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.669
THING THAT WENT THROUGH

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:57.874
ANYONE'S MIND. SO I AM GUILTY.

02:51:57.940 --> 02:52:06.616
THE. LITTLE DID I KNOW. MAYBE

02:52:06.683 --> 02:52:10.653
LITTLE IS ALL I WANTED TO KNOW.

02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:11.220
TO MY ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN

02:52:11.287 --> 02:52:14.357
WRONG NOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE.

02:52:14.424 --> 02:52:17.293
AND WE MUST TREE. ENOUGH IS
