HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN REDUCING

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.905
RECIDIVISM THE CDC ARE SHOULD BE

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:23.207
COMMENDED HOWEVER IN DECEMBER

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.876
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO LA AND

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.377
REPORT THE ALEJO IDENTIFIED

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.680
SEVERAL. SHORTCOMINGS IN IN THE

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.148
IMPLEMENTATION OF CDC OURS

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.883
VARIOUS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:32.517
THAT COULD LIMIT THE

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.585
REHABILITATION PROGRAM SUCCESS.

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.120
FIRST IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER EACH

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:37.789
PROGRAM IS READ RESEARCH BASED

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:38.890
AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE SAME

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.525
MANNER AS THE MODEL PROGRAM

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.093
SECOND REHABILITATION SLOT TO DO

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.594
NOT APPEAR TO BE ALLOCATED OR

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.530
USED EFFECTIVELY. TO MEET IN MAY

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.799
NEEDS FINALLY THE REPORT NOTES

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.701
THAT CDC ARE USES.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.235
LOTT APPROACHES FOR MEASURING

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.171
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE THAT MAKE IT

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:54.539
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:56.274
EXISTING PROGRAM RESOURCES ARE

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.109
BEING USED EFFECTIVELY PRIOR TO

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.444
PURSUING ANY LEGISLATION

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.579
RECOMMENDING CHANGES. TO ANY IN

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.181
PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:04.849
WE BELIEVE AN AUDIT IS NECESSARY

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.718
TO UNDERSTAND CDC OURS.

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.586
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES FOR

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.121
IMPLEMENTING THE REHABILITATION

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.590
PROGRAMS AS THE STATE PRIORITIZE

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.257
AND INCREASES FUNDING FOR

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.592
REPLAYABILITY ASIAN PROGRAMS

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.094
BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.261
ENSURE THAT STATE FUNDS ARE

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:19.063
BEING USED. AS EFFICIENTLY AS

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.665
POSSIBLE WE SIMPLY NEED MORE

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.467
INFORMATION BEFORE DISCUSSING

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.135
FUNDING LEVELS OR ANY

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.737
LEGISLATIVE FIXES TO SEE YOU SEE

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:26.704
OURS INCREASE PRISON

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:27.939
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.307
BELIEVE THIS AUDIT WILL PROVIDE

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.809
ENOUGH. INFORMATION TO MAKE MORE

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.510
INFORMED DECISIONS ON THESE

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:34.379
PROGRAMS ESSENTIALLY WE SPENT

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:34.912
OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:36.614
DOLLARS A YEAR ON REHABILITATION

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:37.949
PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:38.616
IS WORKING AND WHAT ISN'T

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.284
WORKING. I BELIEVE IN EVIDENCE

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:41.886
BASED PROGRAMS ARE ALSO THE SAME

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:42.954
TIME THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.156
THERE ARE NOT PROGRAMS FOCUSED.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:46.758
WITH ARTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:47.959
HELP OTHERS.

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.560
WITHIN THE SYSTEM.

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:51.262
REHABILITATING KEEP THEM FROM

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.164
RECEIPT OF AIDING A BUT THIS IS

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.233
AN ISSUE THAT I THINK IS REALLY

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.834
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:59.337
KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE OUR MONEY.

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.872
AYE EFFECTIVELY ARE MONIES BEING

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:01.839
USED IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:02.673
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO REDUCE

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.242
RECIDIVISM WHICH IS IMPORTANT

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:05.476
FOR US.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:09.147
THEN WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME.

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.214
TO DO THAT AND TO LEARN THAT AND

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.816
UNDERSTAND IT SO THAT IS WHY

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.018
WE'RE HERE TODAY AND WE AND I

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.320

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:24.869
ONE AREA WHICH SUGGESTS THE

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:27.838
JUSTICE THAT GO INTO IT DESERVE

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.206
THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

WHERE THEY GO OR THEY HOME

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:48.025

THING THAT I'VE ALWAYS BROUGHT

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.142
UP.

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.277

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:01.685
RELATIONSHIP.

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.287
BUT I'M HERE WITHOUT GUILE TO

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.990
BASICALLY SAY THAT IN THE LAST

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:08.058
COUPLE OF YEARS. AYE THIS

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.127
DEPARTMENT HAS REALLY STEPPED

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.495
FORWARD PARTICULARLY THEIR

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:13.197
REHABILITATION SECTION. THEY'VE

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.165
REHIRED MANY OF THE TEACHERS

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.400
THEY'VE TAKEN MANY OF THE

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.369
SUGGESTIONS THAT THE UNION PUT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.237
FORWARD AND DR CHOATE WHO'S

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.373
RUNNING THE REHABILITATION IS

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.642
REALLY UNINSPIRED LEADER. IN SO

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.710
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE OPPOSE

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:29.213
THE IDEA THAT WE THINK THAT WE

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.281
NEED TO REWARD.

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:32.082
PEOPLE OVER AND CDC ARE THAT ARE

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.417
REALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.052

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:38.756
WE'VE SEEN AND IT'S NOT JUST.

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:41.325
RECIDIVISM WILL NOT JUST BE.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.727
WHAT HAPPENS IN REHABILITATION

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.596
WILL NOT BE THE ONLY INPUT TO

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:47.398
REDUCING RECIDIVISM? WE'VE SEEN

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:49.233
THE RATE OF RETURN TO PRISON GO

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.701
FROM SIXTY SIX TO PERCENT TO

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.503
TWENTY TWO PERCENT.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.171
WE THINK THAT'S AWESOME WE THINK

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.640
THAT THERE THE FORTY SIX PERCENT.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:57.875
IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE OVER

00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.877
SIXTY PERCENT RATE THAT WE HAD

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.313
BEFORE IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM SO

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.181
THEY ARE DOING A DECENT JOB

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.816
THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD. AND

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.351
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO SAY WE

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.520
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS AUDIT

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:11.121

ON I'VE BEEN IN SOMEWHERE.

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:58.435
DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS DD

SO NUMBER ONE I'M GLAD THAT CDC

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:08.579
ARE IS WILLING PARTICIPANT IN

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:09.646
THIS BECAUSE THIS IS RE IS

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.215
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:13.450
THEM ARM FOR BOTH PARTIES TO

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:16.253
WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE ANSWERS.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.855
MY COLLEAGUE AND I WILL BE ONE

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:19.356
OF THE MAIN REASONS WHAT WE'RE

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.492
DOING THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MY

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:23.827
UNION SEIU IS TALKING ABOUT.

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:26.563
WHENEVER WE ASK WHENEVER PEOPLE

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.631
WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS.

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:30.100
ASK ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.502
I'M WE SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.203
NUMBERS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT A

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.304
RETURN ON INVESTMENT WE DON'T

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:36.140
GIVE THOSE.

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.808
I BELIEVE THIS AUDIT WILL NOT

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.210
ONLY HIGHLIGHT ON HIM SOME AREAS

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:42.413
WE CAN IMPROVE.

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.914
AND I DON'T USE THE WORD WRONG

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.582
OR PROBLEMS BUT AREAS WE CAN

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.017
IMPROVE.

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.585
BUT I ALSO THINK WILL HIGHLIGHT

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.487
UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESSES IN AREAS

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:51.889
THAT WE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT.

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:54.324
LIKE I THINK YOU MENTIONED.

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.827
WAS THE ACTORS GANG I'M I DON'T

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.695
KNOW OF ROCK CLIMBING WORKS AND

00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:01.832
IMPRISONS BUT WHAT IF IT DOES.

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.167

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.724
THERE'S PROBLEMS AND ALISON THE

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.826
NUMBERS WHO ARE DOING VERY WELL

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:36.894
GOAL DRAMATICALLY DOWN. BUT IT'S

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.128
NOT.

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.429
SHOULD NOT BE A REFLECTION ON

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:42.432
THE PROGRAM SHABBY REFLECTION ON

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.201
ON VIA THE DIRECTOR WHO'S DOING

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.636
IT SHOULD BE IN A BAD REFLECTION

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.571

BAKED A DAY EXPERIENCING

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.448
CHALLENGES THAT HOPEFULLY WE

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.117
NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.852
AND THAT THEY INCORPORATE THAT.

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.587
IN THE AUDIT AND I THINK THAT

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.655
SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:08.025
THAT THE CI USE IS IS SAYING

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:09.726

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.662
ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND AGAIN.

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.697
AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE WILL

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.366
AGREE. I LOOK AT THIS IS A WAY

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:19.102
TO HIGHLIGHTED SUCCESSES NOT TO

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.671
BE DEPARTMENT UP.

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.940
AND AND AND AGAIN WHEN WE FINISH.

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.741
GET FINALLY GET THE ACCOLADES

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.577
THAT THEY NEVER GET.

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.145
AND AND I'LL JUST HAVE MYSELF IS

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:29.446
THAT IT IS OUR JOB AS A

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.614
LEGISLATIVE BODY.

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.249
TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT I MEAN

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.251
THAT IS A HUGE PART OF OUR ROLE

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.419
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND IT'S

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.420
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:37.287
CONFIDENCE IN WHAT WE'RE

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.523

BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:44.828
AND THE IMPORTANCE AND I THINK

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:45.696
IT'S ONLY.

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.664

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.517
PERCENT.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.019
NOW AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE NEARLY

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.487
ALL LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE STATE

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:39.688
ARE EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.134
THE CITY PAYS IT'S REQUIRED

PAY ITS RETIREE OBLIGATIONS.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.355
THE FINAL FINANCIAL INDICATOR IS

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:14.523
WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY HAS

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.458
SOUND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.426
I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S BEEN

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.027
DEMONSTRATED BY THE INFORMATION

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.463

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.368
INVESTMENT GOAL.

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:27.936
FURTHER THE CITY HAS A NUMBER OF

CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PLACE TO

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.539
MONITOR THIS IS THE CITY'S

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.374
FISCAL OUTLOOK. NOT ONLY IS THE

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.042
ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS VERY

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.511
TRANSPARENT.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:36.945
AND PROVIDES FOR A NUMBER OF

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.147
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:40.582
PARTICIPATE THE CITY ALSO HAS A

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.317
FISCAL INVESTMENT IN OVERSIGHT

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.552
COMMITTEE THAT IS COMPOSED OF

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:44.920
TWO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THE

MEMBERS AND TO CITIZENS AT LARGE.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.795
BASED ON THIS FACT.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:53.762
BASED ON THE FACT THAT I'VE GONE

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:54.363
OVER.

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.265
THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT CITY

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:57.866
OF LINCOLN IS AT RISK OF

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.635
BECOMING AN AT RISK CITY.

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.303
NOW OTHER ISSUES THE SENATOR

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.503
GAMES.

OUR CHALLENGES CITY IS ALREADY

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:07.876
TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.478
RESOLVE.

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.146
LIKE NUMBER CITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.481
THE CITY DID HAVE A LEGAL ISSUE

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:13.816
RELATED TO TIERED WATER RATES

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.617
STRUCTURE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.419
THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED THE

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:19.621
ISSUANCE OF REFUNDS TO CUSTOMERS.

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:20.489
LIKE MANY OTHER CITIES IN

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.690
CALIFORNIA THE CITY WAS

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.192
HISTORICALLY NOT PAYING FOR MEN

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.694
IS MUNICIPAL UTILITIES THIS

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:27.196
ISSUE WAS RESOLVED AT THE

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:28.630
BEGINNING OF THIS FISCAL YEAR.

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.599
THE CITY EVEN WENT FURTHER AND

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:31.667
AUTHORIZED A FACT FINDING

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.669
INVESTIGATION. WHICH THE OTHER

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.938
WITNESSES SPOKE TO A ON THIS

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:37.773
ISSUE RESULTING IN A REPORT THAT

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.842
WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.310
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:43.078
CAPPER REPORT THAT WAS MENTIONED

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.913

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.716
LAST COUNCIL MEETING.

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:49.284
SO AS I'VE DEMONSTRATED THE

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.285
CITY OF LINCOLN IS NOT ONLY

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.387

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:53.889

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.824
WHEN AN ISSUE ARISES.

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.192
ALTHOUGH AN AUDIT CAN BE VERY

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.094
BENEFICIAL TO IDENTIFY ISSUES

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.429
THE CITY OF LINCOLN SIMPLY DOES

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:02.998
NOT HAVE THE STAFF RESOURCES.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.266

REQUESTING DOING SO WOULD

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.804
PREVENT STAFF WORKING ON MUCH.

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:12.374
NEEDED PROJECTS THAT WILL

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:13.008

OR WOULD YOU GO TO THE WHOLE I

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:14.562
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:15.463
FIVE.

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.831
WERE SIX IN THE STATE THAT WOULD

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.299
FALL WITHIN THE S..

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.368
REQUEST

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:22.236
YEAH AND THANK YOU MISS MS BAKER

THAT I'VE LOOKED AT IT I'VE SEEN

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.308
A RANGE BETWEEN NINE AND TWELVE

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.242
DIFFERENT FACILITIES IN THE

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.277
STATE.

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.544
I ALSO LOOKED AT SOME

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:31.913
INFORMATION THAT THE FEDERAL

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:32.747
GOVERNMENT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.148
HOMELAND SECURITY THE INSPECTOR

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.716
GENERAL DID SOME.

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.551
UNANNOUNCED VISITS AND THERE

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:38.786
WERE TWO FACILITIES IN

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:39.787
CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAD SOME

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.822
VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.791
CONDITIONS I THINK WE WOULD WANT

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:45.393
TO INCLUDE THOSE TWO FACILITIES.

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:46.694

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.663
A HANDFUL OF ADDITIONAL

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.465
FACILITIES TO GET REGIONAL AS WE

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:53.167
OFTEN DO NOW NORTH SOUTH.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.236

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.771
NUMBER OF DETAINEES IN THOSE

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.539
DIFFERENT FACILITY SO WE WOULD

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:00.107
TRY TO PICK A REPRESENTATIVE

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:01.876
SAMPLE ACROSS THE STATE BUT.

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.277

AGAIN DID AN UNANNOUNCED VISIT

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.216
AND REALLY WAS VERY CONCERNED

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:10.284
ABOUT THE CONDITION SO I THINK

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.452
WE WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:13.254

PRIVATE FOR PROFIT.

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.900
DETENTION CENTERS THIS IS

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.368
FOCUSING ON OUR PUBLIC

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:09.170
FACILITIES WHERE.

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:11.305

CONDITIONS IN THESE AND MORE

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:21.615
IMPORTANTLY TRYING TO LOOK AT.

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:23.384
THE THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:24.919
COMING DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.020
GOVERNMENT.

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:27.588
AND THEN HAVING LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS COME TO US AND

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:29.924
SAYING WE WE NEED MORE MONEY FOR

SAYING THAT THE MONEY IS A MONEY

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:36.163
OFFSETTING. THEN THE POSSIBILITY

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.264
OF ACTUALLY DETAINING PEOPLE WHO

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:39.233
ARE ACTUAL CRIMINALS IN THE

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.935
SYSTEM SO IT WE FEAR OF

01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:42.603
COMPLEMENTARY WE ACTUALLY.

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:43.604

DUPLICATIVE IN THEIR WORK AND

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:51.912
SO THEY THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:52.713
COMPLEMENT YOU TO THE WORK THAT

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.914
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING GIVEN THAT

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.316
THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE THE

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.317
PUBLIC.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.085
FACILITIES AND I I DON'T KNOW

01:35:58.152 --> 01:35:59.253
THAT THERE'S ANYONE FROM AGES

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.921
OFFICERS HERE IMAGINE THAT IF

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.990

OFFICE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.827
THAT. WHAT WE DIRECTED THEM TO

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:09.296
DO JUST LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:11.966
BUDGET? WHICH I SUPPORTED WAS TO

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:12.500
HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:16.670
COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:17.238
OF COUNTY.

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.939
JAIL FACILITIES AND PRIVATE SO

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:20.508
THAT IT IS.

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:21.775
A LOOKING AT THE VERY SAME

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:22.977
ENTITIES THAT COULD BE COVERED

01:36:23.043 --> 01:36:24.745
BY THIS AND THAT THE AG ISN'T

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.514
JUST LOOKING AT PRIVATE RECENT

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.715
THAT YOU'RE UNDERSTAND IS THE

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:29.083
AGES LOOKING ONLY A PRIVATE WELL

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.918
WE. WE'VE FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:31.552
THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.821
GO INTO THE PRIVATE FACILITIES

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:34.989
WHICH THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:37.625
NOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:39.393
AGE IS GOING TO GO IN AND LOOK

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.828
AT THE HONG GOING CURRENT

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:43.230
SITUATION OF. NOT ONLY WHAT THE

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:44.899
CONDITIONS ARE WHAT THE.

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:46.901
ICE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE WHEN

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.870
IT CAME TO ACCESS TO MEDICATION

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.305
ACCESS TO.

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:54.508
DUE PROCESS ACCESS TO SHELTER.

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:56.110
AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:58.345
THE HUMAN CONDITIONS AND WHAT

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.680
WE'RE ASKING THE AUDITOR'S TO GO

01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:01.815
MUCH MORE BEYOND THAT IN TERMS

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:04.552
OF WHAT IS A TO STATISTICAL DATA.

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.487
THOUGH HISTORIC DATA OF HOW MANY

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.289
FOLKS ARE ARE BEING HELD HOW

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:09.557
MANY UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.258
THERE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:12.927
THERE'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED.

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.929
CHILDREN THAT ARE MISSING AND WE

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:16.764
HAVE AND THE US GOVERNMENT HAS

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:18.399
NO IDEA WHETHER AT WHERE THEIR

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:21.001
PLACE SO WE'RE ASKING WHERE.

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.969
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE KNOW IF

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.637
THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE ARE

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:25.673
THEY ARE THE BEING PLACED ON THE

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:27.174
WHAT THE DEPORTED. HAVE THE

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.143
PASSED AWAY WE DON'T THERE'S NO

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.211
DATA TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.812
WHETHER THAT SO WE'RE ASKING THE

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:33.347
AUDITOR TO GO IN AND HAVE A

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.782
DEEPER LOOK INTO A MORE

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.750
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:40.187
DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OF WHERE

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:40.821
WE KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.289
BECAUSE THAT'S. ALL THE

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:42.923
INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.524
GET.

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:45.659
BEFOREHAND HAVE BEEN EITHER TO

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:46.860
ADVOCATES OR TO THE FREEDOM OF

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:48.596
INFORMATION ACT. SO THIS WILL

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.364
GIVE THEM A BETTER COMPREHENSIVE

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:52.266
LOOK AT ONLY THE FINANCING OF

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:53.634
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF.

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:54.935
THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHERE THEY'RE

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.604
GOING TO ARE THEY ACTUALLY GOING

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.439
TO SERVICE THIS COMMUNITY.

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:00.841
OR ARE THE YOU KNOW BEING USED

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.843
TO SUPPLANT FUNDS FOR.

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.545
GROWING THAT THE PRISON THE

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.447
LOCAL PRESENTER JAILS OF SELF

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.081
THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT WHERE

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:07.881
WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT ARE

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:09.917
DIFFERENT AND AGAIN THE AG DID

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:11.719
LOOK AT OUR LETTER. AND THOUGHT

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.020
IT WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO WHAT WE

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:14.288
WERE WHAT THEIR WORK TO DURING

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:15.189
THANK YOU AYE.

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:17.758

THAT THAT MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.900
BUT ALSO DUPLICATIVE SINCE THE

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:27.534
RESOURCES TO BE GOING INTO THE

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.470

AUDITOR LOOKING INTO THIS AND

01:38:46.453 --> 01:38:47.688
THE DISRUPTION THAT IT HASN'T

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:48.889
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.924
FACILITIES THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.493
THIS ISN'T DATA THAT CAN BE

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:54.094

LIKE BEEN IT'S BEEN VERY

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:04.038
PATCHWORK AND IT'S BEEN VERY

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.406
PIECEMEAL WHICH TAKES A LOT OF

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:06.874
TIME FROM THE ADVOCATES AND.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.675
WITH THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:08.609
WITH THEM.

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:11.612
DAVID HAD VERY LIMITED ACCESS

01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:12.079
TO SOME OF THESE.

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:15.883
.

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:16.850
FACILITIES AND IN ONE OF THE

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:17.518
INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE ON ONE OF

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:19.186
OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JAILS.

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:20.054
THEY WERE HOUSING HOW MANY

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.323
CHILDREN.

THEY WERE HOUSING TWENTY FOUR

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:25.726
CHILDREN THAT WE HAD NO IDEA I

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.161

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:35.035
COUNTY.

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:37.104
A AND

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.472
SO THE FOYER RICK HAVE BEEN A

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:39.340
LITTLE I MEAN THEY ARE DIFFICULT

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:40.274
FOR FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:41.709
EASY BUT THEY ARE ARE THEY ARE

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.644
PART OF THE PUBLIC INFORMATION.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:44.945
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ALSO THAT.

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:46.680
MUCH OF THE INFORMATION MAY BE

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.582
REQUESTED IT LISTED SOME OF THE

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.217
LOCATIONS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:51.051
THEY TRACK IT SOMETHING THAT ICE

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:52.486
HOUSE.

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.854
HAVE YOU ARE OR THESE

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:56.023
ORGANIZATIONS REACHED OUT TO ICE

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:58.025
TO GET THAT INFORMATION AGAIN

01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:00.461
IT'S BEEN THROUGH FOIA REQUEST

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:02.129
WHICH AGAIN TAKES TIME.

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:04.465
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IS

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.632
THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.233
THREE HAVE BEEN OVER A HUNDRED

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.167
DEATHS.

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:08.769
OF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.471
DETAINED AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.339
KNOW IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT OF

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:13.741
THEIR SOME TRENDS AND PATTERNS

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:14.541
IN WHERE.

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:16.210
WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:17.544
REALLY HAPPENING SO IT'S BEEN

01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:19.179
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT.

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.215
JOURNEY TRYING TO GET

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.183
INFORMATION AND GIVEN THAT THE

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:24.985
POPULATION FLUCTUATES AND OUR

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:26.553
CONCERT MOVING WE WERE TIME MAKE

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.821
SURE WE GET THE DATA AND THE

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:29.990
STATISTICS AGAIN. THE HG IS

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:32.025
LOOKING AT THE CURRENT. HEALTH

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:34.361
AND CONDITION OF OUR IMMIGRANT

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:35.562
POPULATION AND.

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:36.964
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:39.066
REFUGEES THIS AUDIT WILL GO MORE

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:40.601
IN DEPTH THAN LOOKING AT.

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.836
STATISTICAL DATA ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.304
FOUGHT BACK FIVE YEARS THIS IS

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:46.940
WHY. THE THE THE HONORS THE

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.609
AUDITS LOW PRICEY BUT IT'S

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.511
INFORMATION WE DON'T HAVE NOW WE

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:52.613
HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY FOLKS ARE

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:54.081
BEING HELD WHAT THEIR STATUS IS

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.383
OF THEIR. THEIR IMMIGRANT CASE.

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.018
ARE THEY BEING.

01:40:58.085 --> 01:40:59.620
ACASO BEFORE SOME OF THOSE

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:00.821
CHILDREN HAD REALLY WANT ASYLUM

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:02.489
CASE BUT WERE STILL BEING HELD

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.525
TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:05.559
SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:07.094
NEED TO KNOW I MEAN DEPENDING ON

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:08.128
ONCE WE GET THAT INFORMATION

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:09.963
WILL BETTER KNOW AND DO WHAT WE

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:11.999
NEED TO DO ACCORDINGLY. SO AGAIN

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.033
WE FEEL THAT THIS IS

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.635
COMPLIMENTARY BUT I I RETORTED

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:15.936

TO. REDUPLICATED WORKED AT THE

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:21.475
AGE IS DOING AGAIN THIS IS WHY

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.544
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WE CHECK

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:24.912
WITH WITH THEIR OFFICE FIRST AND

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:26.413
THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AND IS

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.281
MY AGE AND IT IS A VERY

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.082
COMPREHENSIVE TASK THAT THE AG'S

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:30.818
OFFICE HAS BEEN GIVEN. AND AN

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:33.253
AMOUNT OF TIME TO WHICH IS MARCH

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.488
OF TWENTY NINETEEN OR SPRING YOU

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.523
KNOW YEAR FROM NOW. TO TO GET

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:38.058
THAT AND IT DOES MAKE ME

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:40.794
HESITANT TO TO THEN HAVE ANOTHER

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.196
PROCESS WE'VE WE'VE APPROVED

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.931
DIES BEFORE MANY TIMES A

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:44.898
DIFFERENT AGENCIES WE END UP

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.533
WITH THEM SPENDING A WHOLE LOT

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.235
OF TIME. AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:49.403
THE DELAY TO GET THE INFORMATION

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.071
THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR

INTO THIS AT IS THE AUDITOR HAVE

01:41:58.846 --> 01:41:59.379
A CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE

01:41:59.446 --> 01:41:59.813
TWO ENTITIES WERE.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.781
RIGHT TO TO FACILITY SANTA ANA

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:01.582
CITY JAIL WAS ONE FACILITY

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:02.149
ACCORDING TO THE IG REPORT

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:02.783

THEO LACY WHICH IS AN ORANGE

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:08.589
COUNTY. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:09.990
FACILITIES THAT THE INSPECTOR

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.758

01:42:41.388 --> 01:42:42.523
INFORMATION IS WORTH HAVING.

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:44.224
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE LOOK AT

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.158
IT AND ALSO THAT THERE IS A

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:46.927
GEOGRAPHIC BALANCE POPULATION

FIND A BALANCE FOR THAT AND HOW

01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:56.470
IT MAY PRIORITIZE SO THANK YOU

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:57.905

SO I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.452
WE ALREADY HAVE THIS.

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:14.955
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BEING

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:16.723
INVESTIGATED.

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.625
AND OUR CALLING FOREIGN AUDIT

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.761
BUT THE AUDIT DESCRIPTION SOUNDS

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:21.895
LIKE AN INVESTIGATION MORE THAN

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.931
A NOT IT.

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:28.468
AND SO WOULD YOU CLARIFY THAT

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:30.837
DIFFERENCE TWO NECESSARILY SO

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:33.440
THE HG. AND I APOLOGIZE IF I

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:35.742
MISSPOKE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:36.376
HAVING YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF NEXT

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.578
TO YOU. INTO.

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:40.647
THE EIGHTY G. OTHER LE ARE

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:42.449
LOOKING INTO PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:44.318
FACILITIES AND THEY'RE LOOKING

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:46.219
AT TWO BEINGS THE STANDARD OF

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:47.854
CONDUCT THE STANDARD OF CARING

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:50.257
CONDITION. OF THE CONFINEMENT.

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:52.759
SO THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.695
WOULD CALL AN INVESTIGATION.

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:57.764
THE A PUBLIC ART IT IS MORE ON

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.633
DATA FISCAL ANALYSIS ON WHERE

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.034
THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY BEING

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:01.935
USED.

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.904
FROM THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THE

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:04.504
FEDERAL FUNDS ARE BEING DRAWN

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:06.740
DOWN ON THE ACTUALLY BEING USED

DETAINED AND THE REFUGEES.

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:14.514

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:17.985
WHETHER HOW MANY WHAT TYPE OF

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:19.319
IMMIGRANT THEY ARE WHAT WHETHER

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:21.154
CASES SO THAT THOSE ARE THE

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:27.060
DIFFERENCES THAT IS AN AUDIT.

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:27.961
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT.

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:30.097
.

01:44:30.163 --> 01:44:32.132
GIVEN THE COST OF THIS AUDIT.

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:33.800
IT HAS SOME GOOD INTENTIONS BUT

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.035
IT WOULD BE BETTER LAYERED ON

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:35.569
TOP.

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.371
AFTER.

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:38.505
CURRENT INVESTIGATION IS

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:40.540
FINISHED

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:42.976
AND WHEN THERE WE COULD MAY BE.

01:44:43.043 --> 01:44:45.445
A TIME LIMIT OR.

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:48.982
NARROWER FOCUS.

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:51.952
THE AUDIT REQUEST.

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:54.821
RIGHT NOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.556
THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF OVERLAP.

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:57.624

I REALLY DON'T. HIT I DON'T

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:01.762
THINK IT'S.

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:03.063
WE DON'T WE RARELY HAVE ENOUGH

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:05.499
BY THE TIME FOR OUR AUDITOR TO

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:09.036
AUDIT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED.

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:12.572
SAYS IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT.

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.708
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO STREAMLINE

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:16.710
THIS. AUDIT AT A LATER DATE

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:19.813

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:32.793
QUESTION.

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:34.161

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:39.199
FUTURE. A IN OTHER VENUES ANYWAY

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:41.435
AND SO MAYBE. WE WOULD GET DOWN

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.003
TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MAY

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.938

BECAUSE. I I WAS UNDER THE THE

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.979
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN SOMEBODY

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:33.379
IS A LITTLE PREMATURE.

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:34.447
WHAT WE LEARNED THAT HAVE

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.416
SENATORS AND TEND TO REQUEST NOT

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:38.151
IT WE MET WITH THE SENATOR? AND

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:39.919
WE ACTUALLY AGREED WITH HER THAT

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.354
EVERY DOLLAR MATTERS AND WE MUST

01:57:41.421 --> 01:57:43.956

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:45.191
OF PUBLIC DOLLARS

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.192
WE FOLLOWED UP WITH THE

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.827
SENATOR'S OFFICE COUPLE TIMES

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.929

INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED.

01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:58.137
IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER

01:57:58.204 --> 01:57:59.605
SANDERS OFFICE HAS TRIED TO GET

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:01.507

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:03.242

SUBCOMMITTEE THREE ON HEALTH AND

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:16.856

LA TIMES ARTICLE REFERENCING

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:22.862
QUESTION NUMBER ONE. OF THE

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:25.398
AUDIT REQUEST.

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:26.365
I'M PREPARED TO.

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.100
ADDRESS ALL OTHER QUESTIONS

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.602
OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT BUT OF

COURSE GIVEN THE TIME LIMIT.

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:32.772
I CAN DEFER TO THAT.

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:35.641
COMMITTEES AND QUESTION PERIOD.

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:37.810
AND THAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR

01:58:37.877 --> 01:58:39.545
THE FISCAL YEAR IN QUESTION I'M

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.714

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:44.484
PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL BUDGET.

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:46.018
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SMALL

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.054
AMOUNT LIKE TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.989

01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:10.543
LITTLE PREMATURE AND AND AT

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.078
BASED ON A LOCAL ISSUE.

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:14.614

RESPONSIVE TO SANDERS REQUEST.

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.286

SOME OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:42.121
ARE BECAUSE OF THE.

02:07:42.187 --> 02:07:45.324
PREVALENCE OF MATH HOUSES AND

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:48.193

NORTH COUNTY TO SAN DIEGO IS.

02:08:02.808 --> 02:08:04.910
MARGINALLY HIGHER BUT THE

THOSE FACILITIES IS MUCH HIGHER.

02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:17.689
NONE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

THE TIMING OF THIS BEING

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:01.773
NECESSARY. MAY BE.

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.908

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:13.752
THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE NOT

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:14.986
OBJECTING TO THIS PARTICULAR

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:16.121

HAPPEN YOUR DISTRICT TO.

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.061
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE SHOULD

02:18:23.128 --> 02:18:25.096
ARMY WAS MUCH INFORMATION AS

WE HAVE SAID THANK YOU.

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:30.869
SO WITH REGARD TO TIMING OF

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.370
THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT A MISTAKE

02:18:32.437 --> 02:18:33.405
I HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:34.773
YOU DURING THE MIDST OF THIS

02:18:34.839 --> 02:18:35.807
CRISIS THERE WAS A LOT OF FINGER

02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:37.475
POINTING THAT HAPPENED. AND WE

02:18:37.542 --> 02:18:38.943
ALL MADE AGREEMENT AT THE TIME

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.679
TO SORT OF SET THAT STUFF ASIDE

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:41.312
AND RESPOND TO THIS IS

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:43.248
GRASSLEY'S POSSIBLE. AND THEN

02:18:43.314 --> 02:18:45.917
COME BACK TO IT AFTER THAT

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:46.751
MARKETS HE HAS PASSED

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:47.285
EMERGENCY HAS PASSED THE

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:48.486
DECLARATION HAS BEEN REMOVED.

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.588
AND AFTER ACTIONS ARE HAPPENING

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:52.390
BUT I THINK PRECISELY BECAUSE OF

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:53.992
THE NATURE OF WAS MISS A TOP WAS

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:55.260
MENTIONING THE CITY THE CITY

02:18:55.326 --> 02:18:56.594
DOESN'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:57.495
OFFICER.

02:18:57.562 --> 02:18:59.564
THERE BEEN A MULTITUDE OF THE

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:00.932
COMMENTS THAT I THINK REALLY.

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:02.667
MAKE THE STATE'S AUDITING OF

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:05.537
THIS A VERY IMPORTANT UM THE IN

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:06.871
THE STATE IS A THIRD PARTY

02:19:06.938 --> 02:19:08.506
INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF THIS IT

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:09.841
IS NOT EITHER THE ACTORS THAT

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.176
WERE INVOLVED THE IMMEDIATE.

02:19:11.242 --> 02:19:13.712
RESPONSE AND I THINK AS A RESULT

02:19:13.778 --> 02:19:15.213
HAS ADDED A. HEIGHTENED

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.682
CREDIBILITY THAT CAN HELP REALLY

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:19.150
AGAIN BRING OUT THE LESSONS

02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:20.018
LEARNED THAT ARE IMPORTANT FROM

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:21.419
THIS AND REALLY SPEAK.

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:23.755
FOR WHAT I THINK MAY BE A NEW

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:25.223
NORMAL GOING FORWARD BUT ANYWAY

02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:26.725
I THINK THAT THE VALUE HERE IS A

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.159
THIRD PARTY THAT WAS NOT

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:29.661
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO

02:19:29.728 --> 02:19:30.995
DAY RESPONSE FOR WHICH FOR

02:19:31.062 --> 02:19:32.497
QUESTIONING. AND I THINK THAT

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:33.898
KIND OF IMPARTIALITY.

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:36.634
IS VALUABLE THANK YOU AND THEN

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:37.435
IT DOES BRING ME TO MY NEXT

02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:39.671
QUESTION THE OTTERS HIS HOW CAN

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:42.707
IT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE BEING

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:43.274
ABLE TO STRUCTURE.

I WOULD REALLY WANT YOU HAVE THE

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:50.148
BENEFIT OF ALL THESE OTHER

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:51.349
REPORTS RATHER THAN ON A

02:19:51.416 --> 02:19:53.618
PARALLEL TRACK. KNOWING THAT ONE

IS EXPECTED OUT IN JULY JUST A

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:57.188
COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW THINK THE

THE POINT MISTER COLOR MAKES

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:09.667
THAT THIS IS A. AN INDEPENDENT

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:10.301
THE DIDN'T HAVE A.

02:20:10.368 --> 02:20:12.971
THE A FINGER POINTED OUT AT THE

STATE OR THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.441
BUT HOW WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE.

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:17.976

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:20.645
RESOURCES GIVEN THE.

02:20:20.712 --> 02:20:22.680

RIGHT THANK YOU MS BAKER UP WE

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:26.317
ABSOLUTELY WOULD WANT TO TIME

02:20:26.384 --> 02:20:28.319
OUR WORK NOT BASED ON SOME OF

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:30.021
THESE REPORTS IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.122
THIS AFTER ACTION REPORTS VERY

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:32.957
COMPREHENSIVE THAT'S ALREADY OUT

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:34.292
THERE WHAT STAFF WOULD START

02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:36.227
WITH. IS LOOKING AT THAT WE WE

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:37.629
ALSO HAVE AN AUDIT WE ARE

02:20:37.695 --> 02:20:39.297
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING. OFFER

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:41.232
CENTER KOISO ON PUBLIC HEALTH

02:20:41.299 --> 02:20:43.101
NURSES AND THE STAFFING AND ONE

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:44.302
OF THE ELEMENTS HE ASKED US TO

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:46.004
LOOK AT WITH STAFFING RELATED TO

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.705
THE HAVE BAY OUTBREAK SO WE HAVE

02:20:47.772 --> 02:20:48.840
SOME INFORMATION THAT WE'VE

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.275
CLEAN FROM THAT AUDIT.

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:52.177
BUT CERTAINLY AN AUDIT OR AT A

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:53.278
REPORT THAT'S COMING OUT IN JULY

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:54.879
THAT'S A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:56.281
THAT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT

02:20:56.347 --> 02:20:57.982
ONCE IT COMES OUT. WE WOULD

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:59.617
CERTAINLY NOT WANT TO TAKE A

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:00.752
LOOK AT IT IF THERE'S

02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:02.253
INFORMATION THAT'S IN DRAFT I

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:03.488
WOULD ASSUME WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:04.656
LOOK AT THAT NOW.

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:06.891
THE CITY WOULD COOPERATE IN

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:07.592
HAVE.

02:21:07.659 --> 02:21:08.693
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN THE

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.093
ASSURANCE FROM THE

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.495
REPRESENTATIVES HERE SO WE WOULD

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:12.163
WANT TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:13.898
LOOK AT THE SUPPORT BEHIND IT SO

02:21:13.965 --> 02:21:15.600
THAT WE ARE DUPLICATING EFFORT

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:17.168
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT

02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:18.269
LOOK AT IT FROM WITH A CRITICAL

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:20.138
EYE. SO ABSOLUTELY ANY OF THIS

02:21:20.205 --> 02:21:21.639
INFORMATION WILL BE VERY HELPFUL

02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:23.641
TO US AND HOPEFULLY TO THE

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:24.876
EXTENT WE CANRELY ON THAT

02:21:24.943 --> 02:21:26.511
INFORMATION IT'LL CUT BACK THE

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:27.712
NUMBER OF HOURS WE HAVE TO

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:28.580
INVEST IN HOW MUCH THIS AUDIT

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.615
WILL COST I HOPE SO AND I THINK.

02:21:30.682 --> 02:21:32.350
EVEN HAVING A CIVIL GRAND JURY

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.284
LOOKING AT THIS MEAN THEY'RE

02:21:33.351 --> 02:21:34.586
FAIRLY INDEPENDENT THEY'RE

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:35.220
SUPPOSED TO BE OF EARLY

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:36.721
INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT CAN TAKE

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:37.522
A LOOK AT IT SO I DON'T KNOW

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:39.357
WHEN THAT. IS TIMES WHEN THAT'S

02:21:39.424 --> 02:21:40.859
COMING OUT BUT THAT WOULD BE

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.327
IMPORTANT TO TO LOOK AT AS WELL

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:44.863
WITHOUT REINVENTING. THE WORK

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:45.496
THAT THEY'RE DOING OF JUST TWO

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:47.298
MORE QUICK ONES BAKER CAN I JUST

02:21:47.365 --> 02:21:47.932
LOOK TWO BITS OF INFORMATION MY

02:21:47.999 --> 02:21:50.635
UNDERSTAND IS THE THE THE GRAND

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:51.603
JURY REPORT IS.

02:21:51.669 --> 02:21:52.804
THURSDAY I'M AND I WOULD POINT

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:53.872
OUT THE GRAND JURY.

02:21:53.938 --> 02:21:55.640
HIS FUNDED HOUSE WITHIN THE

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.308
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND I DON'T

02:21:57.375 --> 02:21:58.142
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE

02:21:58.209 --> 02:21:59.777
RESOURCES THE AUTHOR HAS.

02:21:59.844 --> 02:22:01.646
AVAILABLE NOR SOME OF THAT

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:02.847
SUBPOENA POWER TO SUBMIT THAT

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.415
I'M ACCESSING OF OF MORE

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:05.516
CONFIDENTIAL DOT.

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:06.718
THAT THAT MAY BE THINKING THAT

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.953
MAYBE THE CASE I I KNOW I'M HOW

02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:09.821
WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL FOR

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:10.655
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE A

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:11.990
CIVIL GRANGER IT'S A THANKLESS

02:22:12.056 --> 02:22:13.024
TASK AND AND IT DOES.

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:14.759
HAVE TO DO A LOT OF

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:16.828
INVESTIGATIVE WORK. AM I DO

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:19.163
WANNA ALSO THIS I GUESS IS FOR

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.797
THE AUDITOR BUT ALL THIS TO BE

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:22.100
MINDFUL OF WHEN A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:22:22.166 --> 02:22:23.501
CRISIS HAPPENS.

02:22:23.568 --> 02:22:25.503
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO DO BOTH

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.438
AFTER ACTION AND WHAT CAN WE DO

02:22:27.505 --> 02:22:30.275
BETTER TO PREVENT IT AGAIN AND.

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:32.210
AND HAVE A BETTER RESPONSE IF

02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:33.878
FUTURE THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:35.280
OF HINDSIGHT.

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:37.315
AND I I KNOW YOU CAN'T

02:22:37.382 --> 02:22:38.416
INCORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:39.684
REPORT I KNOW THAT WHATEVER PART

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:40.618
YOU HAVE I FOR ONE WILL BE

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:41.853
LOOKING THAT WERE VERY CAREFUL

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.187
NOT TO BE HAVING THE BENEFIT OF

02:22:43.254 --> 02:22:44.355
HINDSIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:46.157
DONE A CONTRACT THIS WAY. YOU

02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:46.891
SHOULD HAVE USED THAT THE

02:22:46.958 --> 02:22:48.526
RESOURCES THAT WAY BUT THIS WAS

02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:50.561
A VERY TENSE TIME AND A MAJOR

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:51.996
PUBLIC HEALTH. ISSUE.

02:22:52.063 --> 02:22:53.498
I THINK IT'S MORE OF A

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:54.666
STATEMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE A

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:56.401
CAUTION FOR US THAT WE ARE JUST

02:22:56.467 --> 02:22:57.235
GOING TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT

02:22:57.302 --> 02:22:58.503
HAPPENS IN HINDSIGHT WHEN

02:22:58.569 --> 02:22:59.737
THERE'S BEEN AN AN URGENCY.

02:22:59.804 --> 02:23:01.806
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A

02:23:01.873 --> 02:23:02.407
QUESTION BUT I DO HAVE ONE FOR

02:23:02.473 --> 02:23:03.441
YOU.

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:06.778
MANY OF THE ISSUES. THAT I OR

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:07.679
QUESTIONS ARE RAISED IN THE

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:10.014
AUDIT. OF ALL GOOD ONES.

02:23:10.081 --> 02:23:12.684
TO ME LOOK VERY MUCH DIRECTED SO

02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:13.751
MUCH WHERE THE COUNTY WOULD

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:15.086
TRADITIONALLY BE AN AUTHORITY

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.688
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE

02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:17.889
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS YOU SEE

02:23:17.956 --> 02:23:20.625
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF MANY

02:23:20.692 --> 02:23:21.492
SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOR

02:23:21.559 --> 02:23:22.894
EITHER FUNDED BY THE STATE OR

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:25.897
SEPARATELY. AND LESS SO THE CITY

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:27.765
AND YET THE AUDIT DOES SEEM TO

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:29.167
HAVE SORT OF EQUAL I WAS EQUAL

02:23:29.233 --> 02:23:30.868
TIME BUT IT WILL FOCUS ON THE

02:23:30.935 --> 02:23:33.037
CITY AND THE COUNTY.

02:23:33.104 --> 02:23:34.038
.

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:35.206
I I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD

02:23:35.273 --> 02:23:36.607
CHANGE THE WAY THE AUDITOR LOOKS

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:37.675
AT THIS KNOWING THAT MOST

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:39.444
COUNTIES ARE NOT. ARE ARE THAT

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:40.878
MORE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL FOR

02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:42.814
REGION AND NOT SO MUCH A CITY.

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:44.782

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:46.250
I CAN GIVE YOU JUST SORT OF SAY

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:49.253
RESOURCES ON THAT OR.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.588
MAKING SURE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:52.023
WHERE IT'S FAIR I MEAN FRANKLY

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.124
THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:54.692
PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:56.794

WITHOUT WATERS IN MY DISTRICT

03:07:59.735 --> 03:08:01.336
AND I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSE TO

03:08:01.403 --> 03:08:02.437
THAT WATER FOR SOMETIME AND AND

03:08:02.504 --> 03:08:03.905
OTHERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT

03:08:03.972 --> 03:08:05.107
THEIR FINANCES.

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:07.442

GOV BINDER HAVE BEEN GOING

03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:18.220
THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM.

03:08:18.286 --> 03:08:19.388
I THINK WE'RE ASKING FOR SYSTEM

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:21.590

THE WORST CASE THERE'S GONNA

03:08:25.894 --> 03:08:27.629
HAPPEN IN THREE MONTHS BUT. IF

03:08:27.696 --> 03:08:28.864
THEY HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED TO

03:08:28.930 --> 03:08:29.965
THE AUDITOR THEY'VE GOT THEIR

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:31.166

THOUSAND HOURS TO THE CITY ABOUT

03:08:36.638 --> 03:08:38.206
WATER. I THINK IT'S BETTER IF

03:08:38.273 --> 03:08:39.941
THEY USE THAT TIME IN THE NEXT

03:08:40.008 --> 03:08:40.642
THREE MONTHS TO GET THEIR

03:08:40.709 --> 03:08:41.777
FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER IF IT

WHAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO

03:08:55.791 --> 03:08:58.593
WOULD BE THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS.

03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:00.195
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY HAVE

03:09:00.262 --> 03:09:02.064
RUN A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THEY

03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:03.899
HAD BUT THE CITY OF WHAT THAT

03:09:03.965 --> 03:09:05.033
WATER HAD A RESERVE AMOUNT OF

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:06.368
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT EIGHT

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:08.570

HAD TO DO IS CUT BACK ON VARIOUS

03:09:13.809 --> 03:09:16.011

HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO WORK

03:10:02.624 --> 03:10:04.526
NOW SARAH CANNELLA IT JUST

03:10:04.593 --> 03:10:06.294
JUSTICE BUT I DON'T WANT TO

03:10:06.361 --> 03:10:06.928
DEBATE OUR HONOR BECAUSE I WOULD

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:07.629

03:10:18.273 --> 03:10:19.674
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE DOING

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:41.429
HARD TO PUT PREDICT WHAT THE

03:10:41.496 --> 03:10:42.430
WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT

03:10:42.497 --> 03:10:43.698
I THINK WE DID A FROM MONTEBELLO

03:10:43.765 --> 03:10:44.666

IN ORDER. AND.

03:10:49.437 --> 03:10:51.173
IF THE COMMITTEE SO WHICH IS I

03:10:51.239 --> 03:10:53.341
THINK IT WOULD BE A APPROPRIATE

03:10:53.408 --> 03:10:55.477
TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY NOW.

03:10:55.544 --> 03:10:57.712
IF WE DO THIS.

03:10:57.779 --> 03:10:58.313
I DON'T WANT TO EAT MY WORDS

03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:00.148
LATER AND SOMETHING TRAGIC

03:11:00.215 --> 03:11:01.883
HAPPENS SO IF YOU CAN ASSURE ME

03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:03.718
THAT THIS IS BEING DONE THEN I

03:11:03.785 --> 03:11:04.786

CITY OF MONTEBELLO ALSO THAT

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:19.868
BECAUSE THERE CITY MANAGER WHO

03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:23.305

AND THE AND THE AND I'M OPEN TO

03:11:44.759 --> 03:11:48.430
IDEAS SENATOR ALAN.

03:11:48.496 --> 03:11:50.765

THINGS MADE RIGHT IN THE CITY

03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.108
ITEM I GUESS IF IF WE'RE GOING

03:12:00.175 --> 03:12:01.810
TO SUPPORT A DELAY I THINK WE

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:03.044
WOULD ALL ASK YOU PERSONALLY TO

03:12:03.111 --> 03:12:04.646
MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THERE'S

03:12:04.713 --> 03:12:05.914
GOOD PROGRESS BEING MADE IN.

03:12:05.981 --> 03:12:08.950
BUT I I WOULD.

03:12:09.017 --> 03:12:10.752
MATT.

03:12:10.819 --> 03:12:11.920
YEAH CON THOUGH THEN AND THEN A

03:12:11.987 --> 03:12:13.722

THE AUDIT BUT FOR IT TO BEGIN IN

03:12:17.092 --> 03:12:18.693
AUGUST HOUSE THAT. THE PROBLEM

03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:20.028
IS THAT IT'S OUR GOAL IN AUGUST

03:12:20.095 --> 03:12:21.529
THAT THERE'S NOT ONE REQUIRED SO

03:12:21.596 --> 03:12:23.398
FEW PROVE THE AUDIT STARTING IN

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:24.065
AUGUST AND THEY'VE MADE

03:12:24.132 --> 03:12:26.701
SUBSTANTIAL. IMPROVEMENT THEN

03:12:26.768 --> 03:12:28.003
THEN AUDIT GOES FORWARD I I

03:12:28.069 --> 03:12:29.938
THINK OUR GOAL IS FOR THEM TO TO

03:12:30.005 --> 03:12:30.872
GET THEIR HOUSE OVER SO THAT IT

03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:32.307
OUGHT IS NOT NECESSARY AGAIN IF

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:34.342
IT IS. THEN THEY START AUGUST WE

03:12:34.409 --> 03:12:35.410
HAVE A MEETING IN AUGUST WE CAN

03:12:35.477 --> 03:12:36.845
APPROVE AND I WILL I WILL

03:12:36.912 --> 03:12:37.812
SUPPORT OUT AT THAT TIME

03:12:37.879 --> 03:12:40.115
DIFFERENT SENATOR LARA THEN BY

03:12:40.181 --> 03:12:41.283
SARAH.

03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:42.350
I THINK YOU I'M INTRIGUED ABOUT.

03:12:42.417 --> 03:12:45.320
CHAIRMAN YOUR YOUR MOTION OF.

03:12:45.387 --> 03:12:46.922
OUR OR.

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:49.424
OF DISCUSSION ABOUT APPROVING

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.726
NODDED WITH CONDITIONS IF THEY

03:12:51.793 --> 03:12:52.127
HAVE AN MATT.

03:12:53.295 --> 03:12:54.930
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT

03:12:54.996 --> 03:12:55.897
THAT WOULD BE.

03:12:55.964 --> 03:12:59.234
BUT CERTAIN ALLOWS US SOMETHING.

03:12:59.301 --> 03:12:59.801
THAT'S CONSIDERED THAT WE WE

03:12:59.868 --> 03:13:01.236
DON'T.

03:13:01.303 --> 03:13:03.438
YOU KNOW IT BELIEVE.

03:13:03.505 --> 03:13:06.641
IT GIVES YOU THE INSURANCE THAT

03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:09.311
YOU KNOW NOT THAT. TO YOU KNOW.

03:13:09.377 --> 03:13:11.446
CUP POLICE ANY BLAME GIVEN THAT

03:13:11.513 --> 03:13:12.013
DOESN'T AN EXECUTIVE TEAM

03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:13.415
LOOKING AT I MEAN THAT THEY

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:14.683
PROTEST TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS

03:13:14.749 --> 03:13:15.750
RIGHT SO THAT.

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:18.420
ON IT WILL KICK IN.

03:13:18.486 --> 03:13:20.322
I I MEAN I I THINK THAT'S ALSO

03:13:20.388 --> 03:13:22.157
SOMETHING WORTHY OF LOOKING OUT

03:13:22.223 --> 03:13:24.125
BECAUSE THERE'S NOW THE THE.

03:13:24.192 --> 03:13:26.328
THAT MAY NOT A THREAT BUT YOU

03:13:26.394 --> 03:13:26.962
KNOW THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S

03:13:27.028 --> 03:13:28.063
GONNA BE.

03:13:28.129 --> 03:13:29.397
YOU KNOW I'M NOT IT LOOMING IF

03:13:29.464 --> 03:13:30.899
WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT I MEAN I

03:13:30.966 --> 03:13:33.168
THINK. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE

03:13:33.234 --> 03:13:34.035
HIGH RISK ON IT.

03:13:34.102 --> 03:13:36.905
PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO BE EVER

03:13:36.972 --> 03:13:37.706
CATCHES AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS

03:13:37.772 --> 03:13:39.708
A FAULT. THAT TO KERN FOLKS BUT

03:13:39.774 --> 03:13:41.810
AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT

03:13:41.876 --> 03:13:42.844
THE CITIZENS OF THAT WATER WHICH

03:13:42.911 --> 03:13:45.280
IS ALSO EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT SO

03:13:45.347 --> 03:13:46.414
ARE IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. MISTER

03:13:46.481 --> 03:13:48.416
CHAIRMAN IF I MAY I GUESS IT

03:13:48.483 --> 03:13:49.851
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER RIGHT SO

03:13:49.918 --> 03:13:51.920
IF WE APPROVE THAT THE OTHER

03:13:51.987 --> 03:13:52.921
STARTS IN AUGUST IN LEICESTER

03:13:52.988 --> 03:13:54.789
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. AND THE

03:13:54.856 --> 03:13:55.790
AUDITOR AT THAT TIME SAYS WE

03:13:55.857 --> 03:13:56.691
DON'T NEED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS

03:13:56.758 --> 03:13:58.393
ARE REAT THAT WE COULD JUST I'M

ASSUMING CANCEL AT THE AUGUST

03:13:59.094 --> 03:14:02.330

03:14:02.397 --> 03:14:02.931
WHAT HAPPENED AS THE OTHER AYE

03:14:02.998 --> 03:14:03.932
AYE.

03:14:03.999 --> 03:14:04.866
I THINK THAT'S WHAT RIGHT IF I

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:05.533
COULD WE WOULD WOULD JUST WANT

03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:06.434
TO KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA WOULD

03:14:06.501 --> 03:14:07.936
BE BECAUSE I'M WHAT WE CAN

03:14:08.003 --> 03:14:09.437
DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN HAVE A A

03:14:09.504 --> 03:14:11.406
BUDGET GOING FORWARD. AND WE CAN

03:14:11.473 --> 03:14:12.707
SHOW WHEN DEMONSTRATE HOW WE

03:14:12.774 --> 03:14:14.909
WOULD SET ASIDE RESERVE FUND IS

03:14:14.976 --> 03:14:16.811
WEALTH COMMITMENTS TO. OPEC

03:14:16.878 --> 03:14:17.912

03:14:20.515 --> 03:14:21.282
THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:23.151
RESERVE IT'S PROBABLY NOT

03:14:23.218 --> 03:14:24.552
REALISTIC APPOINTS WHAT I CAN DO

03:14:24.619 --> 03:14:25.620
IS READ IT REVERSED SHOW THAT

03:14:25.687 --> 03:14:27.288
WERE REVERSING THE TREND. AND I

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:28.456
WOULD JUST ASK THAT THAT MAY NOT

03:14:28.523 --> 03:14:30.125
BE AT THE AUDITOR'S DISCRETION

03:14:30.191 --> 03:14:31.459
BUT IT BE AT THIS COMMITTEES

DISCRETION WELL BECAUSE WHILE

03:14:33.194 --> 03:14:36.064
THE OTHER PERSON WHETHER OR NOT

03:14:36.131 --> 03:14:36.765
IT WOULD MAKE DIRECTLY I.

03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:39.134
THE AUDITOR.

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:41.236
IT WOULD BE INCLUDED.

03:14:41.302 --> 03:14:41.836

EXPECT YOU TO ALICE HAVING COME

03:14:48.043 --> 03:14:49.711
UP WITH AS MONEY BECAUSE THEN

03:14:49.778 --> 03:14:51.046
YOU WOULD REALLY NEED ABOUT IT.

03:14:51.112 --> 03:14:52.614
A LOT THAT.

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:53.848
AYE SHOWING THAT WHERE YOU WERE

03:14:53.915 --> 03:14:56.151
REVERSING THE TREND ISN'T AS

03:14:56.217 --> 03:14:56.718
IMPORTANT.

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:58.853
BEFORE WE CALL ON THE VICE CHAIR

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:00.021
AYE IT.

03:15:00.088 --> 03:15:02.190

I I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:08.363

ASSESSMENTS.

03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:16.137
BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLYING FOR.

03:15:16.204 --> 03:15:17.739
AND AUDIT APPROVED BY BUDGET IN

03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:19.340
JAIL LIKE IS THAT CORRECT WELL I

03:15:19.407 --> 03:15:20.875
I THINK MISTER CHAIR IF THE

03:15:20.942 --> 03:15:23.311
COMMITTEE DECIDES TO APPROVE AN

03:15:23.378 --> 03:15:24.813

THE COMMITTEE AND SAY WE'VE

03:15:35.056 --> 03:15:36.291
LOOKED AT MATERIALS THAT THE

03:15:36.357 --> 03:15:38.226

03:15:38.293 --> 03:15:40.662
US RECENTLY WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED

03:15:40.728 --> 03:15:42.430
WITH IF THE CITY'S WILLING TO DO

03:15:42.497 --> 03:15:43.965
THAT ENGAGE WITH THEM OVER THE

03:15:44.032 --> 03:15:45.967
NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS SIMILAR TO

03:15:46.034 --> 03:15:47.035
WHAT WE DO WITH TENNIS INITIAL

03:15:47.102 --> 03:15:48.436
ASSESSMENT WHEN WE CONDUCT OUR

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:50.472
INITIAL ASSESSMENTS. WE ARE

03:15:50.538 --> 03:15:52.440
ENGAGING WITH LOCALS.

03:15:52.507 --> 03:15:54.576
IT AND NOW IT'S VOLUNTARY IT'S

03:15:54.642 --> 03:15:55.710
PUBLIC INFORMATION HIS WAY ON

03:15:55.777 --> 03:15:56.811
ABSTRACT STORY AUTHORITY TO

03:15:56.878 --> 03:15:58.613
CONDUCT AN AUDIT BORE CERTAINLY

03:15:58.680 --> 03:16:00.915
LOOKING TO SEE. YOU MAY BE IN A

03:16:00.982 --> 03:16:03.318
DEFICIT SITUATION RIGHT NOW BUT

03:16:03.384 --> 03:16:04.853
DO YOU HAVE PLANS AND DO THOSE

03:16:04.919 --> 03:16:06.855
PLANS LOOK REASONABLE AND THAT'S

03:16:06.921 --> 03:16:08.389
THE CRITERIA THAT WE WOULD BE

03:16:08.456 --> 03:16:10.058
USING. DURING THE COURSE OF THE

03:16:10.125 --> 03:16:11.759
NEXT FEW MONTHS IN WORKING WITH

03:16:11.826 --> 03:16:13.761
THE CITY OF ATWATER. ARM IN

03:16:13.828 --> 03:16:15.130
PREPARATION TO COME BACK TO THE

03:16:15.196 --> 03:16:16.865
COMMITTEE AND SAY YOU KNOW THE

03:16:16.931 --> 03:16:18.566
COMMITTEE COULD RESEND THE AUDIT

03:16:18.633 --> 03:16:19.601
IN AUGUST

03:16:19.667 --> 03:16:21.402
SAYING THAT BASED ON THE

03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:23.271
ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE IN. THE

03:16:23.338 --> 03:16:24.706
ABILITY ENGAGE WITH THE CITY

03:16:24.772 --> 03:16:26.641
THAT. THE RISKS THAT WE'VE

03:16:26.708 --> 03:16:28.643
IDENTIFIED MAY STILL BE THERE

03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:31.613
BUT THE PLANS AND PROTOCOLS THAT

03:16:31.679 --> 03:16:33.381
THE CITY HAS PUT IN PLACE WE

03:16:33.448 --> 03:16:34.916
THINK ARE REASONABLE SO WHAT WE

03:16:34.983 --> 03:16:36.618
WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD DO. IN

03:16:36.684 --> 03:16:37.886
THAT SITUATION IF WE DON'T

03:16:37.952 --> 03:16:39.354
CONDUCT AN AUDIT WE WOULD STAY

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:40.522
THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

03:16:40.588 --> 03:16:42.557
MONITOR THE CITY OF THAT WATER

03:16:42.624 --> 03:16:43.124
AND IF WE FELT THERE WERE

03:16:43.191 --> 03:16:45.293
CONCERNS WE MIGHT COME BACK TO

03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:46.694
THE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR.

03:16:46.761 --> 03:16:49.364
AND AND REQUEST AN AUDIT AGAIN

03:16:49.430 --> 03:16:51.266
SO I THINK WE CERTAINLY COULD DO

03:16:51.332 --> 03:16:52.567
THAT I DON'T KNOW IF MY GENERAL

03:16:52.634 --> 03:16:54.135
COUNSEL. YOU AGREE WITH ME.

03:16:54.202 --> 03:16:55.670
MIGHT NOT SO MY I'M DEFERRING TO

03:16:55.737 --> 03:16:57.138
MY CHIEF COUNSEL HAS UNDERSTANDS

03:16:57.205 --> 03:16:59.240
OUR REGULATORY. AUTHORITY S.

03:16:59.307 --> 03:17:00.475
THINK IF THE COMMITTEE MAKES A

03:17:00.542 --> 03:17:02.844
DECISION TO BASICALLY

03:17:02.911 --> 03:17:04.345
CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE AUDIT.

03:17:04.412 --> 03:17:05.847
AND EXPECT THAT MY OFFICE

03:17:05.914 --> 03:17:08.283
REPORT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE IN

03:17:08.349 --> 03:17:09.150
AUGUST I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.

03:17:09.217 --> 03:17:10.652
BY SARAH.

03:17:10.718 --> 03:17:12.287
WELL.

03:17:12.353 --> 03:17:14.622
LET ME.

03:17:14.689 --> 03:17:15.623
IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:17.058
MEETING IN AUGUST IN MY POSITION

03:17:17.125 --> 03:17:19.060
ON THIS WOULD CHANGE.

03:17:19.127 --> 03:17:20.528
BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ART

03:17:20.595 --> 03:17:21.696
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIXTEEN

03:17:21.763 --> 03:17:23.031
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HOURS

03:17:23.097 --> 03:17:24.766
WHICH IS WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS SO

03:17:24.832 --> 03:17:26.701
I WON'T BE DONE TOMORROW ANYWAY.

03:17:26.768 --> 03:17:28.469
IT PROBABLY CAN'T START TOMORROW

03:17:28.536 --> 03:17:29.837
SO THERE'S SOME SPOOL UP TIME

03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:31.639
FOR THIS THING.

03:17:31.706 --> 03:17:32.941
BUT APPROVAL OF AN AUDITS HAS

03:17:33.007 --> 03:17:34.609
CONSEQUENCES

03:17:34.676 --> 03:17:36.010
SO IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:17:36.077 --> 03:17:37.812
HERE IS TO GIVE.

03:17:37.879 --> 03:17:39.247
THE CITY THAT'S ATTEMPTING TO

03:17:39.314 --> 03:17:41.115
RIGHT THE SHIP IN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:17:41.182 --> 03:17:42.884
DO SO BEFORE WE LAUNCH AN AUDIT

03:17:42.951 --> 03:17:44.652
TEAM IN THERE THEN.

03:17:44.719 --> 03:17:46.521
CONDITIONALLY APPROVING AN AUDIT

03:17:46.588 --> 03:17:49.190
HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT.

03:17:49.257 --> 03:17:50.959
MAY NOT BE REVERSIBLE.

03:17:51.025 --> 03:17:53.094
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THIS ON

03:17:53.161 --> 03:17:55.029
THIS DIRE AS CAN SET SPECIFIC

03:17:55.096 --> 03:17:56.931
ENOUGH CONDITIONS ON A LOT OF

03:17:56.998 --> 03:17:59.334
APPROVAL TO MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT.

03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:00.335
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK

03:18:00.401 --> 03:18:01.936
HERE WITH THIS ITEM AGENDA IT

03:18:02.003 --> 03:18:04.138
ANYWAY IN AUGUST WOULD BE MY

03:18:04.205 --> 03:18:06.074
GUESS EITHER BECAUSE. THE

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:07.508
AUDITOR DECIDES IT OR NOT IT'S

03:18:07.575 --> 03:18:08.910
NOT REQUIRED WITH THE CITY

03:18:08.977 --> 03:18:10.678
DISPUTES THE AUDITOR'S POSITION

03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:12.313
ON WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.

03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:13.014
SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD

03:18:13.081 --> 03:18:15.850
SUGGESTIVE IS IF THE INTENT.

03:18:15.917 --> 03:18:18.219
AND THE SPIRIT IN THE INTEREST

03:18:18.286 --> 03:18:19.887
OF THOSE OF US ON THE DYESS IS

03:18:19.954 --> 03:18:21.723
TO GIVE THIS THIS YOUR LOCAL

03:18:21.789 --> 03:18:23.258
JURISDICTION AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:24.926
GET THE WATER OUT OF THE BOAT

03:18:24.993 --> 03:18:26.361
BEFORE WE CAN MEN.

03:18:26.427 --> 03:18:27.895
AS A STATE THEN LET'S GIVE THEM

03:18:27.962 --> 03:18:28.863
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE WATER

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:30.632
OUT OF THE BOAT.

03:18:30.698 --> 03:18:32.867
GEN DID IN AUGUST IS NECESSARY

03:18:32.934 --> 03:18:34.168
AND THAT THE AUDITOR STOPPED

03:18:34.235 --> 03:18:36.271
START THE ON IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT.

03:18:36.337 --> 03:18:37.572
THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION

03:18:37.639 --> 03:18:39.040
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA BE

03:18:39.107 --> 03:18:40.475
TRYING TO.

03:18:40.541 --> 03:18:42.944
DESIGN CONDITIONS ON AUDIT

03:18:43.011 --> 03:18:44.012
APPROVAL HERE THAT ARE GONNA BE

03:18:44.078 --> 03:18:46.114
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DESIGN.

03:18:46.180 --> 03:18:48.716
ANYWAY.

03:18:48.783 --> 03:18:50.184
