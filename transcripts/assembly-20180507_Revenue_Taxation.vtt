IN TWENTY SIXTY SIX BY

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.115
HARNESSING EXISTING MECHANISMS

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:38.450
LIKE THE FEDERALLY ASSIGNED

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.617

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.962
NUMBER AND THE USE OF THE A TENS

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.497
ALLOWS THE FOR IRIS TO BRING IN

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.232
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.900
YEAR AND FACT. AND TWENTY

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:57.502
SIXTEEN THE R. S. THAT'S WHY I

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.070
TEN FILERS PAID OVER TWENTY FOUR

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.473

SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND I TEND TAX

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:06.377
FILERS. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:07.712
THE MAJORITY OF THESE FILERS ARE

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:08.913
RESIDENTS OF REGIONS WITH HIGH

SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATIONS

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:13.485
WHICH CERTAINLY ARE

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.286
CHARACTERISTICS THAT MATCH

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.688
NUMBER OF COUNTIES. IN OUR STATE

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:17.655
SO UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:18.723
NUMBER PROVIDES THESE

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.924

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:32.937
TWO DECADES.

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:33.538
IN FACT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.006
HARNESSING THE OPPORTUNITY OF

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.275

FRANCHISE TAX BOARD COMMENTS IN

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.825
THE ANALYSIS I THINK DEMONSTRATE

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:55.960
THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:56.895
STRENGTHEN OUR ANTI POVERTY

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.030
EFFORTS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE OUR

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.398
TAX SYSTEM BY INCORPORATING

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:01.866
NECESSARY MECHANISMS THAT

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.501
REFLECT THE FULL BREADTH OF WHO

INCLUSION ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:10.475
ADVANCING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:11.843
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PARTY

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.645
AFFECTS MANY WORKERS REGARDLESS

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.446
OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IN

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.748
FACT FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:18.016

ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR SO

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.255
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT AT

THIS ALSO COMES AT A REALLY

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.667
CRITICAL TIME WHEN FEDERALLY THE

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.734
GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:38.169
STRIPPING AWAY ALL FORMS OF

TO HAVE A FEDERAL IF I SO

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:46.678
SECURITY NUMBER BUT THEY WILL BE

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:48.846
CUT OUT OF THE EITC MOVING

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:50.248
