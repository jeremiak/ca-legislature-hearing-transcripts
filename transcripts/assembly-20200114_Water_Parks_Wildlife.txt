SO OF SUMMER PLEASE COME FOR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB FIVE FIVE NINE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY. THE VISION OF THE CONSERVANCY WAS TO CREATE A TWENTY TWO MILE NATURAL AND RECREATIONAL AREA IN THE FLOOD PLAIN EXTENDING FROM PRYING DAM TO HIGHWAY NINETY NINE. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY SIX YEARS THIS CONSERVANCY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES OF FRESH OWN MADERA AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STATE. WORKED HARD BOOK. ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIPS TO MAKE THIS PARKWAY A REALITY. HOWEVER MUCH WORK STILL REMAINS IN ORDER TO FULLY OPERATE AND MANAGE THE PARKWAY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS A SEVERELY UNDERSERVED AND CONTINUES TO FALL FAR BEHIND IN. THE RATE OF PARKS PER CAPITA AS A POSITION I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF SPENDING TIME OUTDOORS DIABETES HYPERTENSION OBESITY THESE COULD ALL BE ALLEVIATED SIMPLY BY SPENDING MORE TIME OUTDOORS IF ONLY WE COULD PROVIDE THE SAFE AND AVAILABLE RECREATIONAL AREA FOR ALL TO ENJOY. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH. AB FIVE FIVE NINE NAMED FOR THE AREA CODE IN WHICH I REPRESENT WOULD ALLOW THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE PARKS AND WOULD PROVIDE FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TRAILS AND SPACES. THAT THE PARK HAS ACQUIRED. AB FIVE FIVE NINE WILL HELP PROVIDE HEALTHY RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO A PART OF THE STATE THAT IS SEVERELY LACKING GREEN SPACE. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE CLOSEST STATE PARK I HAVE IS EIGHTY SIX MILES AWAY. I HAVE A RECREATIONAL AREA AND A HISTORIC SITE CLOSE TO US BUT I HAVE NO STATE PARK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS SHARON WEAVER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY TRUST.
