FIRST TODAY PRESENTS. AB ONE OH SEVEN WHICH EXPANDS AND IMPROVES THE TEMPORARY LICENSURE PROGRAM. FOR SPOUSES OF ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS. MILITARY SPOUSES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED AND UNDER EMPLOYED WITH MOVING TO A NEW STATE. AND BURN THROUGH THEIR SAVINGS AND ARE FORCED TO CUT CORNERS WHILE THEY WAIT TO FIND. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA. THEIR MILITARY SPOUSES. WHO HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS TO RECEIVE A LICENSE THAT THEY'RE FULLY QUALIFIED FOR. MEANWHILE THEY LOSE OUT ON POTENTIAL INCOME AND ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AB ONE EIGHTY SIX WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO CREATE A TAB FOR. TEMPORARY LICENSURE PROGRAM. QUICKLY AND EASILY GET LICENSES IT'S AMANDA TO RESPONSIBLE BOARDS COMPLETED THEIR BACKGROUND CHECKS. BUT IT WAS LIMITED IN THE NUMBER AND SCOPE OF THE BOARDS OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS A BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION NOT WORKING WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. AND TRYING TO GET TO SPOUSES EMPLOYED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES- YOU KNOW THE MILITARY NATIONAL SECURITY ACTIVITY CALIFORNIA GENERATED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE POINT. TWO BILLION WITH A B. BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. BEGINNING THIS YEAR. THE MILITARY SERVICES ARE NOW REQUIRED TO INCLUDE MILITARY SPOUSE PORTABILITY. AND EMPLOYMENT AND THEIR MISSION BASING DECISIONS. FOR THIS BILL IS VERY TIMELY- AND AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENTS WORKING WITH OUR TEAM. AND AT THIS TIME I DO HAVE.

THERE ARE TWO LEADING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KELLY MAY DOUGLAS AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY CHANGES PROPOSED WITHIN AB ONE OH SEVEN. ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE DOCTOR. TO THE DEPARTMENT IS TO HELP MILITARY SPOUSES BUT IT'S CLEAR PORTABILITY. MORE THAN A THIRD OF MILITARY FATHERS WORK AND LIFE AND PROFESSION. HOWEVER STATE THE DIFFICULT TO HIRE MEN AND PRACTICES FOR RE LICENSURE OFTEN BURDENSOME. REDUNDANT AND TIME CONSUMING FOR THEM AND DO NOT ALLOW FOR THEM TO FIT YOUR TIMELY EMPLOYMENT UPON. ARRIVING TO THEIR NEW DUTY STATION. FOLLOWING MY COME. AND ECONOMIC ISSUES FROM CAL SEPARATE HE REDDING ISSUE THAT TRANSLATE INTO A BROADER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ISSUE CAN UNDERMINE PERSONAL NUMBERS AND THEREFORE OUR NATION'S SECURITY THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS MEMBERS FREQUENTLY FIGHT ECONOMIC CONCERNS AT THE TOP REASON WHY THEY DISCONTINUED MILITARY SERVICE. NOT VERY FAMILIES LIKE MOST FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE AFTER REQUIRED TO INCOME TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND AS A RESULT OF THE STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC BARRIERS STATE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN MILITARY THOUGHT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA OTHER SPOUSES ARE STATIONED HERE. NUMBER COULD BE PUT IN A DIFFICULT POSITION CHOOSING BETWEEN THIRTEEN THEIR COUNTRY OR THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THEIR FAMILY AND DECIDES TO LEAVE SERVICE. DEPARTMENT IS GRATEFUL FOR THE INITIATIVE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY I'M HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO EVEN MORE ON AL GORE THE COMPELLING PERSONAL STORY TO SHARE EMPATHIZING THE CHALLENGES EXPERIENCED BY THE MORE THAN SIXTY TWO THOUSAND MILITARY AND PROFESSIONAL IN THE STATE.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHARGE A LETTER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TRACY BURNS AND I'M THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS BOARD. THE BOARD ADOPTED A PRO THE MOST AMENDED CONDITION ON AB ONE OH SEVEN WELL THE BOARD TO COURT FOR MILITARY VETERANS AND SPOUSES WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE INDIVIDUAL COULD WORK IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWELVE MONTHS WITHOUT MEETING THE STATE FLAG IN QUALIFICATION.

BOARDS STILL HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING ISSUANCE OF A TEMPORARY LICENSE TO THERAPISTS FROM OTHER STATES BEFORE THEY HAVE TAKEN THE REQUIRED CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC COURSEWORK DESIGNED TO PREPARE THEM TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA THE UNIQUELY DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT. A GREAT AREA OF MAJOR CONCERN CITED BY THE BOARD AS AN EXAMPLE IS THE FACT THAT SOME OTHER STATES ALLOW REPAIRED OF THERAPY WITH CHILDREN WHILE CALIFORNIA PROHIBITS THAT. NOT BEING AWARE THAT THIS IS PROHIBITED COULD CAUSE HARM TO CLIENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO COMPLETE THE PRACTITIONER'S LICENSE IN JEOPARDY IF THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THE PROHIBITION. THE BOARD HAS ALREADY RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A STREAMLINED LICENSURE PROCESS FOR OUT OF STATE LICENSEES AND ABOUT THAT IS WORKING WELL TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO LICENSURE FOR OUT OF STATE LICENSE APPLICANTS. COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE BOARD ALREADY EXPEDITE MILITARY SPOUSE APPLICATIONS IT BELIEVES THAT THE BOARD ALREADY HAS A PROCESS IN PLACE THE BALANCES EASE OF LICENSURE WITH PUBLIC PROTECTION.
