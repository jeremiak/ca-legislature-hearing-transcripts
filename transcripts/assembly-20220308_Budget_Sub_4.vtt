00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.465
US WENT ON A HOUSING TOUR. THIS

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:18.301
PAST FALL- WE WERE ALL OVER THE

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:21.304

MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE-

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.876
AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM OVER AND

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:28.077
OVER AGAIN IS THE FACT THAT

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:30.280

CAPACITY THAT HE HAS- BUT I ALSO

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.294
BELIEVE THAT OUR BUDGET IS OUR

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.796

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:47.730

TO ME SAYS THAT THAT'S AN AREA

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.702
WHERE WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED- AS

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.337

THAT FIELD- I CAN GET BACK TO

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.244
YOU BUT ONE THING I WOULD NOTE

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:49.912
IS THIS TYPICALLY- FUNDING FOR

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:52.882
HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE. I WOULD

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:55.351

SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. WE DO

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.327
HAVE AN LA A COLLEAGUE WITH MORE

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.195
EXPERTISE IF YOU'D LIKE TO SORT

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.664

YOU- AND- I CAN ANSWER YOUR

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.772
QUESTION AS SORT OF A BIT

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.742
BROADLY. BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON A

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:20.209
LOT OF MOVING FACTORS

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.011
UNFORTUNATELY THEY- THE STATE

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:23.512
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS VERY

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.214
COMPLICATED AND- IT SORT OF

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.683
DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW WHAT'S

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:28.250
HAPPENING WITH REVENUES ARE

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.152
HAVING A SPECIAL FUNDS IT'S ON

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:32.288
TRACK- BUT PROBABLY WHAT I CAN

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:33.055
SAY IS. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:37.493
BUDGET INCLUDES- I BELIEVE IT'S

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.562
ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.897
WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER AMOUNTS

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:43.632
THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.167
MEET THE SAU REQUIREMENTS AND SO

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:47.169
THIS IS- SPENDING ON CAPITAL

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.537
OUTLAY FOR EXAMPLE ADDITIONAL

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:50.639
SPENDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.074
AND THOSE ARE THE AMOUNTS THAT

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.309
WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE RE

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.711
PURPOSED FOR OTHER TYPES OF CELL

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:57.313

IT SHE IS THE APPROPRIATE AFTER

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.088

WITH THE ACCELERATOR FUNDS- ONE

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.103
OF THE THINGS THAT WAS OCCURRING

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.137
WITHIN THE FINAL PIECE OF

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.539

THOSE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO SEEK

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.812
THE FINAL THE FINANCING. IS

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:19.847
THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS OR

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:22.049
HOUSES ASSEMBLY PROJECTS TEND TO

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.551
BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE

ONLY THE ONLY WAY THE TIEBREAKER

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:44.004

OTHER FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS SO

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.098
THAT THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:52.366
AND ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TO

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:53.300
STREAMLINE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.236
MAKE THE PROGRAMS MORE EFFICIENT

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:56.971
TO GET THE MONEY OUT FASTER AND

01:37:57.037 --> 01:37:58.439
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS AS QUICKLY

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:00.541
AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. THE BUDGET

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:02.509
PROPOSES CREATING A NEWER

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:03.978
ADAPTIVE REUSE PROGRAM WHICH

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:06.981
RUNS COUNTER TO THAT GOAL WHITE

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:10.384
WHY DO WE NEED A NEW PROGRAM. WE

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:12.720
DON'T BELIEVE IT CALPERS THE

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:14.788
GOAL- AT ALL IN FACT. THE FIRST

01:38:14.855 --> 01:38:16.123
BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.992
SUGGESTED HERE WHAT ALLOW US TO

APPLY IT. TO ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.962
SO THAT WE CAN GET THE MONEY OUT

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:24.031
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. IF SO WE

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:25.966
WOULD BE TYING IT TO OTHER

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.968
PROGRAMS- NOW THE REASON WHY I

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:29.770
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE-

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.338
I'M A LITTLE BIT OF THE ESSENCE

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.873
HERE. WHEN IT COMES TO A DOCTOR

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:37.044
PREVIOUS. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT-

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.046
EARLIER RIGHT ABOUT. CLUNKY AND

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:41.382
WE REALLY ABLE WITH SWIFT ACTION

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.784

WERE DISTRESSED BECAUSE AND- IT

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:51.525
SO WE MAY BE IN THAT SIMILAR

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.527
SITUATION RIGHT NOW. WHERE THERE

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.162

WOULD COME OUT THIS FALL. THAT

01:39:43.944 --> 01:39:45.612
WOULD BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:48.248
WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAR. OKAY AND

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.050
LAST YEAR AB EIGHT SIXTEEN

STRATEGIES THAT THE COMMUNITY IS

02:10:58.050 --> 02:11:00.452
GOING TO CARRY OUT- THE EAT

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:02.087
LOCAL RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:03.522
ABLE TO LEVERAGE SO IN SOME

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:04.489
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE

OTHER PARTNERSHIPS ARE

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:06.892
RESOURCES. THAT THEY CAN

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:07.993
LEVERAGE THAT WILL HAVE AN

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.161
IMPACT ON THE COST PER

02:11:09.228 --> 02:11:11.863
INDIVIDUAL START- BUT OF COURSE-

02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:15.334
THE INTENT BEHIND THIS PROGRAM

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.069
IS TO ESTABLISH DEMONSTRATE

02:11:17.135 --> 02:11:18.870
PROJECTS. I UNDERSTAND.

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:20.505
TRAGEDIES ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:23.141
AND WHAT IS THE TRUE COST. FOR

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:25.244
SERVING INDIVIDUALS AND YOU KNOW

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:28.180
WHAT OF COURSE IS. OPEN HIGHEST

02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:30.048
HOUSING COSTS STATES IT IN THE

NATION AND SERVING INDIVIDUALS

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:33.552
WHO OFTEN HAVE AMONG THE MOST

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:35.187
COMPLEX CONSTELLATION OF

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.822
OVERLAPPING NEEDS AND THEN OF

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:38.190
COURSE CORRESPONDING SERVICES

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:41.360
THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:44.730
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS. SO I

02:11:44.796 --> 02:11:46.164
GUESS I GUESS IT MUST VERY SOME

02:11:46.231 --> 02:11:48.400
LOOKING AT THIS TWENTY FOUR

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:50.235
POINT EIGHT MILLION TO RE HOUSE

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:51.336
A HUNDRED AND TWO INDIVIDUALS

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:53.138
THAT'S A- THAT'S AT A COST OF

02:11:53.205 --> 02:11:55.574
ABOUT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PER

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:56.408
INDIVIDUAL. WHAT IS THE

02:11:56.475 --> 02:11:57.309
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:59.978
RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:01.313
INDIVIDUALS FROM VARIOUS

02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:03.215
DIFFERENT PLACES ARE RECEIVING.

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:06.018
AND WHAT LIKE TO. I GUESS TO IN

02:12:06.084 --> 02:12:09.254
MANY WAYS UNDERSTAND THIS VAST

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:12.391
COST DIFFERENCE. THE DIFFERENCES

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:15.060
ARE OFTEN WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:16.528
EXISTING PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:17.696
THAT THEY PLAN TO LEVERAGE SO

02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:19.698
THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:21.300
THERE'S A COMMUNITY ALREADY HAS

02:12:21.366 --> 02:12:23.235
A STRONG HOUSING PROJECT THAT

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.203
THEY'RE PREPARING TO BRING. AND

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:27.472
THE PRIMARY NEED THAT THEY HAVE

02:12:27.539 --> 02:12:29.675
IS STREET OUTREACH SERVICES AND

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.576
HOUSING NAVIGATORS SO RELATIVELY

02:12:31.643 --> 02:12:33.145
LOWER COSTS NEEDS THAT ARE

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:35.213
SUPPORTED BY DISCREET. THERE MAY

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.282
BE SOME INSTANCES WHERE SOME OF

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:39.217
THOSE ON THE GROUND SERVICES ARE

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:41.286
ALREADY AVAILABLE BUT IT'S MORE

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:42.821
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WITH REPORT

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:44.956
WILL BE MORE COSTLY. THAT THAT'S

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:46.425
THE WHOLE THAT A FLEXIBLE GRANT

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:49.194
LIKE THIS IS ABLE TO FILL IN SO

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.430
THAT'S PART OF WHY USED IN THE

02:12:51.496 --> 02:12:53.765
WIDER. IN THE RIGHT. COSTS THAT

02:12:53.832 --> 02:12:55.600
ARE BEING FUNDED AND OF COURSE

02:12:55.667 --> 02:12:56.868
PART OF THE INTENT BEHIND THIS

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:59.404
PROGRAM IS TO DO AN EVALUATION

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:01.173
OF THESE DIFFERENT DEMONSTRATION

02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:07.212
MODELS. TO TEST FOR ADVOCATES.

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:09.381
SO IF I WERE TO ASK YOU WHAT

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:11.783
WERE THE RESOURCES IF MAYBE

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:13.418
PERHAPS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:15.187
SERVICES THAT WERE OFFERED TO

02:13:15.253 --> 02:13:17.456
THESE INDIVIDUALS DO YOU HAVE

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:20.692
THAT DATA AVAILABLE. NOT YET WE

02:13:20.759 --> 02:13:22.060
WILL HAVE THAT DATA AVAILABLE

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:23.362
ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:25.530
PROGRAMS AND ARE ABLE TO DO AN

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:27.933
ASSESSMENT OF THE INITIAL DATA

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.301
AND REPORTING BACK. AND THAT

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:31.536
WILL THAT WILL BE UNTIL THE END

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:35.507
OF THE YEAR. APPROXIMATELY YES

02:13:35.574 --> 02:13:37.242
I'D OKAY I JUST I WANT TO BE

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:40.746
CLEAR THAT YOU'RE ASKING YOU HAD
