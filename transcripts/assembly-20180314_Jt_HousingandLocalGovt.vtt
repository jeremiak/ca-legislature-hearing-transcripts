I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:32.765 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT WAS ONE OF THE

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:35.000 region:rollup2
MAIN TOOLS USED BY LOCALS TO

00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:37.302 region:rollup2
FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MANY

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.670 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS. AND IT'S A LOSS

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.538 region:rollup2

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.944 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME OF DISSOLUTION

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.846 region:rollup2

LOSS OF THESE FUNDS HAS

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:57.756 region:rollup2
ACCOMPANIED A RISE IN

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:59.758 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND THE CRISIS THAT

00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:26.185 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IS

00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:28.554 region:rollup2

STATEWIDE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:07.299 region:rollup2
AND NOT MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTED

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:09.468 region:rollup2
TO A MAKING RTA AN ATTRACTIVE A

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:11.103 region:rollup2
TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL OF

00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:12.604 region:rollup2
IT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A TWO.

00:31:11.103 --> 00:31:14.172 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF FREE DISCUSSION

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:15.373 region:rollup2
TODAY THE FIRST IS.

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:18.110 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL WHEN.

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:19.811 region:rollup2
CITY OR COUNTY WANTS TO PUT

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.446 region:rollup2
FORWARD A BOND THAT IS BACKED BY

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:22.314 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES TO FUND

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.949 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AFFORDABLE

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:26.084 region:rollup2
HOUSING. IN GENERAL THAT

00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:28.687 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THEM TO RECEIVE A TWO

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:30.389 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE OF THEIR A LOCAL

00:31:28.687 --> 00:31:31.022 region:rollup2
ELECTORATE TO MOVE THAT BOND

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:33.024 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:34.292 region:rollup2
UNDER REDEVELOPMENT A CITY OR

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:35.994 region:rollup2
COUNTY COULD THROUGH THE

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:38.497 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY ISSUE A

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:39.030 region:rollup2
BOND THAT WAS BACKED BY THE

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:41.199 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAXES.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.502 region:rollup2
AND AND THE ISSUANCE OF THAT

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:44.169 region:rollup2
BOND I DIDN'T REQUIRE A FURTHER

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:46.204 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FROM.

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:48.607 region:rollup2
VOTERS.

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:50.442 region:rollup2
A SECOND ELEMENT IS THAT

00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:51.910 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT GAVE A.

00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:53.545 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES ACCESS TO

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.313 region:rollup2
REVENUES THAT THEY OTHERWISE

00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:56.615 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO. ON

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:58.483 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT

00:31:56.615 --> 00:32:00.051 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION A WORKS

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:02.120 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:03.722 region:rollup2
A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.223 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY TO INDEPENDENTLY

00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:07.259 region:rollup2
LEVY A TAX READING COLLECT.

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:08.660 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FROM THE

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.428 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES THEY SERVE INSTEAD.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.063 region:rollup2
EACH PROPERTY PAYS A SET ONE

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:14.366 region:rollup2
PERCENT RATE.

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:15.267 region:rollup2
AND THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:16.868 region:rollup2
THAT ONE PERCENT RATE ARE

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:17.969 region:rollup2
DIVVIED ACROSS ALL THE LOCAL

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:20.038 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS THAT SERVE THAT

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:22.274 region:rollup2
PROPERTY SO USUALLY A CITY.

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:23.608 region:rollup2
A COUNTY A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:24.810 region:rollup2
VERY SUCH A SPECIAL DISTRICT ME

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:26.144 region:rollup2
LIKE A FIRE DISTRICT OUR LIBRARY

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.512 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:28.680 region:rollup2
AND THE DIVVYING UP OF THOSE

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.882 region:rollup2
REVENUES ACROSS LOCAL

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.551 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS IS DETERMINED BY

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.151 region:rollup2
FORMULA SUDDEN STAY LOST OF

00:32:32.551 --> 00:32:33.952 region:rollup2
THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.787 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:37.456 region:rollup2
TROLL OVER THE ALLOCATION OF

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:40.292 region:rollup2
THESE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES.

00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:42.994 region:rollup2
UNDER REDEVELOPMENT A A CITY OR

00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:45.130 region:rollup2
COUNTY COULD AGAIN CONTROL OVER.

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:46.364 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THEIR SHARE OF THE

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.999 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.733 region:rollup2
FROM A SET OF PROPERTIES. ABOUT

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:50.035 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE.

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:52.304 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR'S REVENUES THAT WOULD

00:32:50.035 --> 00:32:52.571 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE A TO OTHER LOCAL

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.639 region:rollup2
ENTITIES.

00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:55.307 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:57.375 region:rollup2
AND.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:59.144 region:rollup2
THIS DID HAVE FISCAL

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:01.279 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OTHER A

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:02.647 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A. AND IT HAS

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.648 region:rollup2
FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:05.450 region:rollup2
STATE AS WELL.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:07.786 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE STATE DOESN'T

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.721 region:rollup2
RECEIVE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:11.256 region:rollup2
STATE FINANCING SCHOOL FINANCING

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:12.624 region:rollup2
LAWS REQUIRE THAT SCHOOL

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:14.059 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS RECEIVE A MINIMUM

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:15.393 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF FUNDING THROUGH A

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:17.262 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF LOCAL PROPERTY

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:18.630 region:rollup2
TAX REVENUE. AND ST JOURNAL FUND

00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:20.999 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.801 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN A LOCAL PROPERTY TAX

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.636 region:rollup2
REVENUES ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS.

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:25.437 region:rollup2
ARE REALLOCATED TO OTHER

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.638 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:33:25.437 --> 00:33:27.272 region:rollup2
LIKE.

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:28.373 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT A COMMUNITY

00:33:27.272 --> 00:33:30.342 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:31.376 region:rollup2
THEN STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.978 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO THE BACK

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:34.045 region:rollup2
FILL THOSE THOSE PROPERTY TAX

00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:37.048 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:37.983 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE LAST YEAR BEFORE

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.417 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST YEAR OF

00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:41.119 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:42.654 region:rollup2
THIS AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:44.222 region:rollup2
REVENUE REALLOCATED FROM SCHOOLS

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:46.458 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:48.193 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE WHICH NECESSITATED. A

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:51.029 region:rollup2
TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND.

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:53.298 region:rollup2
BACKFILL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:54.833 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE THIS ó THIS WAS

00:33:53.298 --> 00:33:56.368 region:rollup2
AN ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF

00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:58.703 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FOR MANY

00:33:56.368 --> 00:34:00.038 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES. IT ALSO A

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.940 region:rollup2
CREATED SOME TENSIONS BECAUSE

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:03.208 region:rollup2
YOU HAD IN MANY CASES ONE ACTOR

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.076 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MAKING A DECISION THAT

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:06.378 region:rollup2
HAD FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MANY

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:08.013 region:rollup2
INTERESTED PARTIES.

00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:09.881 region:rollup2
A AND THIS IS.

00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:11.416 region:rollup2
ATTENTION THAT CREATED OTHER

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:13.285 region:rollup2
DROVER FORMS OR REDEVELOPMENT

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:15.720 region:rollup2
WAS IN PLACE AND ULTIMATELY.

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:16.421 region:rollup2
LEAD TO CONTRIBUTED TO ITS

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.090 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION.

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:20.892 region:rollup2
.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.028 region:rollup2
AND A.

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.663 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THIS TENSION IS ONE

00:34:23.028 --> 00:34:26.431 region:rollup2
OF THE THE KEY DIFFERENCES THAT

00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:28.099 region:rollup2
SEPARATES OF REDEVELOPMENT

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:30.168 region:rollup2
AGENCIES FROM THE CURRENT TAX

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:31.770 region:rollup2
INCREMENT FINANCING. TOOLS THAT

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:34.139 region:rollup2
ARE IN PLACE TODAY.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:36.908 region:rollup2
WHERE IS REDEVELOPMENT ALLOWED

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.543 region:rollup2
A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A GAIN?

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:40.512 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ALL OF THE PROPERTY

ALL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.717 region:rollup2
THE NEW TOOLS WHAT YOU'LL HEAR

MORE ABOUT FROM THE LATER PANEL

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:48.219 region:rollup2
SUCH AS THAT IT ENHANCE

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:49.754 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:52.157 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IN THE QUEUE COMMUNITY

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:55.560 region:rollup2
REVITALIZATION INVESTMENT AREAS.

00:34:52.157 --> 00:34:57.429 region:rollup2
THEY ARE MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.431 region:rollup2
ALLOWING ESSENTIALLY A CITY OR

00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:00.832 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THEIR

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.100 region:rollup2
SHARE OF GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:04.069 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.236 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE SHARES OF ANY

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:06.404 region:rollup2
NON EDUCATIONAL LOCAL

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.606 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD WANT TO

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:10.208 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:11.376 region:rollup2
IN THE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS OF

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:13.278 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NOT ALLOW.

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:15.380 region:rollup2
THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO GAIN

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:16.381 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THIS THE SCHOOL SHARE

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.849 region:rollup2

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:41.866 region:rollup2
BOND.

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.134 region:rollup2
IF THERE WERE BROWNFIELDS RATHER

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.769 region:rollup2
SORT OF PROBLEMS.

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.504 region:rollup2
IT END IN MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:49.774 region:rollup2
ACTED ALONE SO THAT WAS KIND OF

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:50.308 region:rollup2
THIS THING THAT WE WE REALLY

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:52.243 region:rollup2
NEED TO A POWERFUL TOOL.

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:52.844 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA OF A IN SO ANYWHERE

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.344 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS IDEA BUT FOR AND

00:36:52.844 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
SO.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:57.982 region:rollup2
INTO IN THE IN THE PIE CHART

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:59.651 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT FROM THE PRIOR ALREADY

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:01.619 region:rollup2
A FUNDING HOME THE ELLIS IS

00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:04.155 region:rollup2
CORRECT WHEN YOU SET UP ONE OF

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:05.957 region:rollup2
THESE ON ONE OF THESE AREAS YOU

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:08.793 region:rollup2
COULD TARGET A SIGNIFICANT

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:09.661 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL LIFT INTO INTO FIXING

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:11.229 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE PROBLEM WAS.

00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:13.031 region:rollup2
NO THERE WAS A PROVISION IN THE

THROUGHS TO BE NEGOTIATED AT IN

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:17.202 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES SO THEY THEY WERE

00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:19.404 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET MONEY.

00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:20.705 region:rollup2
AS AS THE PROJECT GREW

00:37:19.404 --> 00:37:23.007 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES WAS WERE NEGOTIATED

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:24.309 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THEIR WORK OR NOT BUT

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:26.211 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE SCHOOL SHARE AND

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:27.979 region:rollup2
THE IMPLICATIONS ON ON PROP

00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:29.581 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT WERE WERE WERE PART

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:31.015 region:rollup2
OF THE ISSUE. NOW.

00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:32.517 region:rollup2
WE'VE ENTERED INTO.

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.319 region:rollup2

AND.

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:43.461 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANNA I

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:45.130 region:rollup2
WANNA POINT OUT WITH YOU COULD

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:46.965 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES ESPECIALLY

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.166 region:rollup2
WITH ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:37:46.965 --> 00:37:51.069 region:rollup2
FINANCE DISTRICTS WILL GET INTO

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:53.037 region:rollup2
THAT IN IT A BIT MORE. BOOK BUT

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:54.606 region:rollup2
WITH REDEVELOPMENT IT WAS ABOUT

BLIGHTED DID IT MEET CERTAIN

00:37:56.574 --> 00:38:00.145 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THAT WORK THAT ALLOW

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:01.846 region:rollup2
THIS TOOL TO BE USED SO SO THE

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:05.316 region:rollup2
WHERE MATTERED A LOT.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:08.486 region:rollup2
WITH E. IFD ARM YOU YOU REALLY

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:09.154 region:rollup2

WITH THE RURAL AREAS IT THIS IS

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.929 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND ACTUALLY I THINK

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:20.098 region:rollup2
HELP FOR IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:21.199 region:rollup2
IN RURAL AREAS IT AND HENCE

SOLVING MAY SURGICAL

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:24.202 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. BECAUSE

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.537 region:rollup2
IT WAS AT THIS

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:27.939 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT BE TRYING

00:38:25.537 --> 00:38:29.541 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:30.708 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING IN IN A RULER YOU

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:32.443 region:rollup2
MAY BE JUST TRYING TO FIX A LEVY

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:35.113 region:rollup2
OR DO SOMETHING ELSE SO. YEAH I

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:36.915 region:rollup2
IF DIS OR FLEXIBLE ON THE WHERE.

00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:39.484 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE SO THAN THAN THE

00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:41.920 region:rollup2
FORMER TOOL AND AND THE CREEL

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:43.755 region:rollup2
LAW IS IS BACK TO THE OLD A

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.123 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT IDEA OF IF WE'RE

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:47.625 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE THESE MORE POWERFUL

00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:50.528 region:rollup2
TOOLS. THEN YOU KNOW THERE HAS

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:51.062 region:rollup2
TO BE SOME FOCUS ON ON WHERE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:52.630 region:rollup2
THOSE TOOLS ARE APPLIED.

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:53.998 region:rollup2
.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.500 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS ARE OR THE

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.568 region:rollup2
THING ALL THESE TOOLS HAVING

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.570 region:rollup2
CARMEN IS.

00:38:56.568 --> 00:39:00.305 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN TALK TO THE OTHER

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.207 region:rollup2
TAXING ENTITIES AS A CITY I CAN

WHETHER OR NOT. THEY BE WILLING

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:08.346 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN AND WHATEVER

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.781 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.950 region:rollup2
TOGETHER A WITH ANY OF THESE

00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:13.718 region:rollup2
TOOLS. BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.553 region:rollup2
TALK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:16.988 region:rollup2
REALLY IT'S REALLY A STATE ISSUE

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:19.057 region:rollup2
WITH WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT SO

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:21.259 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY SO FIFTY PERCENT OF

00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:23.027 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE IF YOU WILL IS SORE

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:24.963 region:rollup2
OFF THE TABLE EVEN FOR. A FROM

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:26.264 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE FROM FROM JUST

00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:30.001 region:rollup2
EVEN THE DISCUSSION.

00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:31.436 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO TAX INCREMENT

GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX THERE'S A

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.674 region:rollup2
COUPLE WRINKLES THAT DID BUT

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.076 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:40.511 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:42.914 region:rollup2
AT IT INTO IN TERMS OF REVENUE

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:44.983 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT THAT HE AYE OF G.

00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:46.885 region:rollup2
KOREA AND THIS A AFFORDABLE

00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:48.653 region:rollup2
HOUSING AUTHORITY TOOL HAVE. IN

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:50.455 region:rollup2
IN SO IN ADDITION JUST TO THE

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:52.023 region:rollup2
GROWTH THE PROPERTY TAX THERE

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.424 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER REVENUES THAT THAT

00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:55.760 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED IN THOSE TOOLS.

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:57.695 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE PROPERTY TAX THAT

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.031 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES GET. UP IN

00:39:57.695 --> 00:40:02.433 region:rollup2
LIEU OF THE VLF THAT THE USED TO

00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:03.534 region:rollup2
GET SO SO THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:04.502 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT SO THEY

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:06.638 region:rollup2
GET AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:09.140 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX IN LIEU OF THIS VLF

00:40:06.638 --> 00:40:11.142 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT WE USE TO GET ALL

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.544 region:rollup2
ALSO AS REDEVELOPMENT DEBTS WERE

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:15.013 region:rollup2
PAID OFF THESE RIDGES RESIDUALS

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:16.714 region:rollup2
IT'LL COME BACK TO A CITY COUNTY

00:40:15.013 --> 00:40:20.084 region:rollup2
OR SPECIAL DISTRICT THESE TOOLS

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:22.220 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH ALSO AUTHORIZE. A THOSE

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:25.089 region:rollup2
ENTITIES TO DIRECT SOME OF THOSE

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:29.427 region:rollup2
SUMMER ALL THOSE PORTIONS INTO.

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:30.094 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFER OUT. AND ARM.

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:30.695 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS AND OTHER

00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:34.198 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:36.200 region:rollup2
OTHER LAWS IT AND ALL THREE OF

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.968 region:rollup2
THESE LAWS E. AYE IF DE KOREA

THOSE OTHER.

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:43.641 region:rollup2
TOOLS NOW OF COURSE WHATEVER

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING HAS TO BE

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.312 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE LAWS BUT

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:48.980 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOW SOME COORDINATION SO

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:50.882 region:rollup2
THAT'S DIFFERENT IN A LITTLE

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.217 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THE OLD. ARE ALREADY A

00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:55.186 region:rollup2
TOOL HAD HAD BY ITSELF.

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:56.220 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:58.356 region:rollup2
OF  <u><c.green>I A FIFTIES</c></u>

00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.325 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THEY ALSO CAN

00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:01.626 region:rollup2
FINANCE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IF

00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:03.227 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT MY LIST.

00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:06.130 region:rollup2
UNDER THE UNDER THAT YOU CAN.

WHATEVER INTEREST ENTRANCE OR

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.970 region:rollup2
IN DEVELOPMENT HERE PROJECTS

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:15.106 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.642 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY STRATEGY YOU COULD

THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
MORE THAN MAYBE SOME PEOPLE

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.358 region:rollup2
REALIZE AS I SAID ONE OF THE

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:34.959 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT REALLY STANDS OUT

00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:37.095 region:rollup2
WITH THE I FD IS A REALLY IT

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.596 region:rollup2
ISN'T ABOUT THE. THE WHERE IS

00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:40.331 region:rollup2
POLITICAL AGREEMENT YOU COULD

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:41.799 region:rollup2
HAVE HALF YOUR CITY YOU WOULD

ENTIRE COUNTY IN EVERY CITY AT

00:41:43.301 --> 00:41:46.104 region:rollup2
IT I MEAN JUST DEPENDS ON ON

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:48.473 region:rollup2
POLITICAL AGREEMENT.

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:51.309 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WRINKLE THOUGH IF

00:41:48.473 --> 00:41:52.610 region:rollup2
THE E. IFT ISSUES ARM PONCE

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:53.678 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE TO BE A FIFTY FIVE

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.879 region:rollup2
PERCENT VOTE.

00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:56.514 region:rollup2
THE THEY HAVE A LITTLE MORE

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.715 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY BEYOND BONDS BUT

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:59.450 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:01.085 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINS THE WHERE. IS THE

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.486 region:rollup2
VOTE REQUIREMENT.

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:03.187 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:04.555 region:rollup2

BRING BACK REDEVELOPMENT.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.430 region:rollup2
WILL KOREA IS REDEVELOPMENT NOW

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:13.131 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHAT

00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:21.172 region:rollup2
ALL THERE THEY'RE ALL IN IN THE

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:24.809 region:rollup2
CREEL LAW.

00:42:21.172 --> 00:42:27.011 region:rollup2
THE OUR ABILITY TO.

00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:28.479 region:rollup2

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:29.313 region:rollup2
REQUIRING A PUBLIC VOTE IT'S

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:31.382 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:33.751 region:rollup2
IMMINENT DOMAIN TO DO WHAT

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:35.153 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY IT'S THERE SO THE

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:36.888 region:rollup2
POWERS A REDEVELOPMENT OR THEIR.

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:38.856 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THERE WERE SOME

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:41.559 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT WERE

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:43.461 region:rollup2
INSERTED INTO LAW TO TRY TO.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:45.530 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE BALANCE BETWEEN

00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:47.832 region:rollup2
THOSE AFFECTED IN THE COMMUNITY

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.934 region:rollup2
ON BY BY THIS TOOL IT AND THOSE

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:52.103 region:rollup2
IN CHARGE AND AND MEET MAYBE

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:53.204 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME YOU KNOW.

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:54.839 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT TO THE LAW TO MAKE

00:42:53.204 --> 00:42:57.008 region:rollup2
IT MAYBE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:59.343 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING

00:42:57.008 --> 00:43:01.279 region:rollup2
AT RDA AUTHORITY THERE'S A LOT

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:02.647 region:rollup2
TO BUILD ON. A IN THAT LAW

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:04.949 region:rollup2

CONDITIONS ARE THAT REQUIRE THAT

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.889 region:rollup2

THIS ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.826 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY A LAW THAT WENT

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:16.260 region:rollup2
THROUGH LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S

00:43:14.826 --> 00:43:18.095 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A VERY FLEXIBLE TOOL

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.831 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK IT'S IT'S UP IT'S

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.731 region:rollup2
GOT A NUMBER AND I KNOW THERE.

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:22.900 region:rollup2
WAS GOING TO BE A SPEAKER ON

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:25.236 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I DO THINK OF THEIR

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.437 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS TO. TO WORK WITH IN

00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:27.738 region:rollup2
IN THAT LAW.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.707 region:rollup2

SIXTY EIGHT WHICH IS REALLY A AN

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:36.514 region:rollup2
OFFSHOOT OF THE I FD LAW. OF IT

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:39.484 region:rollup2
SAYS IF YOU CAN GET YOU CAN

00:43:36.514 --> 00:43:42.320 region:rollup2

OF YOUR OF YOUR CITY AND. BACK

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.835 region:rollup2
TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE FIFTY

00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:59.270 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT VOTE AND THINGS

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:01.139 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.806 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:03.741 region:rollup2
COTERMINOUS.

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:04.342 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:06.177 region:rollup2
SURE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO

00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:07.645 region:rollup2
EXPLORE THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER

00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:09.480 region:rollup2
THINGS ON THE SHELF ARE THERE IN

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:12.316 region:rollup2
THE LAW.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.551 region:rollup2
ANNEXATIONS BETWEEN CITIES AND

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:15.486 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ESPECIALLY OF

00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:16.554 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED AREAS ONE OF THE

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.888 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WHEN CITIES LOOK TO

00:44:16.554 --> 00:44:18.322 region:rollup2
IT.

00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:19.690 region:rollup2
ANNEXING AREA IS THE

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:21.592 region:rollup2
DETERIORATED INFRASTRUCTURE HOW

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:24.061 region:rollup2
YOU GONNA CLEAN THIS UP THERE'S

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:25.630 region:rollup2
A OF A BILL IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:27.632 region:rollup2
A CITY AND COUNTY AS PART OF THE

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.100 region:rollup2
LAUGH CHO PROCESS. TO AGREE TO A

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:30.301 region:rollup2
TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.302 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO FIX THE

INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:34.805 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE SOME THAT'S

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.406 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LAW I THINK THAT WILL

00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:37.241 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY BE BUILT ON IN THE

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.743 region:rollup2
FUTURE. HOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:40.778 region:rollup2
OTHER THERE'S A SEAPORT AND

00:44:38.743 --> 00:44:41.546 region:rollup2
MILITARY I INFRASTRUCTURE LOS

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:43.915 region:rollup2
WELL?

00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:46.117 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:44:43.915 --> 00:44:48.352 region:rollup2
TOOLS I I WANT TO POINT OUT

00:44:46.117 --> 00:44:49.120 region:rollup2
THERE SOME OTHER TOOLS OUT THERE

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:51.722 region:rollup2
IN THE LAW.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.291 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA COMPETES A

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:55.259 region:rollup2
IT'S A THROUGH GOBIZ THERE'S A

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:55.760 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TAX CREDITS ALLOCATED

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.595 region:rollup2
ON VIA COMMUTE OUT STATE

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.496 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:44:57.595 --> 00:45:00.398 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS.

00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:02.033 region:rollup2
THE ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM

00:45:00.398 --> 00:45:04.302 region:rollup2
WHICH ALSO USED TO EXIST WAS

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:05.469 region:rollup2
STATE APPROVED FORTY TWO SOUNDS

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:08.472 region:rollup2

TO GET JOBS INTO A COMMUNITIES

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:11.442 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:13.010 region:rollup2
OF THAT THAT PROGRAM NO LONGER

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
EXISTS THE HIRING TAX CREDIT

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.379 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.981 region:rollup2
SORT OF REPLACED IT HAS BEEN

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:18.382 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDER UTILIZE I THINK

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:20.151 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE SOME IMPROVEMENTS

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.118 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:21.986 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:23.921 region:rollup2

IT NO SIX COUPLE YEARS AGO

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:31.662 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:33.431 region:rollup2
EXISTING CITIES AND COUNTIES IN

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.665 region:rollup2
TERMS OF OF OF DOING SOME

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:36.667 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:38.936 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.204 region:rollup2
HOW THAT MOVES FORWARD. HARM IT

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:42.506 region:rollup2
IS SO I KNOW THERE ARE SOME

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:43.441 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL OKAY WE'VE

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:44.875 region:rollup2
GOT ALL THESE TOOLS AND AND.

00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
OKAY OR SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:48.245 region:rollup2
CITIES HAVE BEGUN TO USE SOME.

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:50.281 region:rollup2
Y. THE USE THE MORE.

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:52.483 region:rollup2
THERE IS SET THIS UP THE LOSS

00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:54.518 region:rollup2
TO REDEVELOP WAS PRETTY TOUGH ON

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:54.719 region:rollup2
OUR CITIES ARE WE LOST MOST OF

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:57.188 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:58.055 region:rollup2
EXPERTS ON COMMUNITY ECONOMIC

00:45:57.188 --> 00:46:00.324 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NOT A LOT

00:45:58.055 --> 00:46:01.692 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LEFT IN IN CITY HALL THAT

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.526 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TO DO SOME OF THIS

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:04.695 region:rollup2
STUFF BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:06.330 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED. ARM A LOT OF THE

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.698 region:rollup2
STAFF WE HAD LEFT WERE FOCUSED

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.100 region:rollup2
FOR ABOUT A FIVE YEAR BATTLE

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:10.534 region:rollup2
WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.003 region:rollup2
TRYING TO HANG ON TO DIFFERENT.

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:14.472 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT IN

00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:16.307 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITY OF LITIGATION

00:46:14.472 --> 00:46:17.074 region:rollup2
ALL SORTS OF THINGS AREN'T SO A

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:18.442 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE.

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2
WHO HOPE A LOT OF CITY

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.679 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS REALLY HAVEN'T HAD

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:23.648 region:rollup2
MUCH MET MUCH BAN WITH TRULY

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:25.483 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THESE NEW TOOLS? NOW

00:46:23.648 --> 00:46:27.385 region:rollup2
THAT THE SORT OF THE DUST IS

00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:28.219 region:rollup2
SETTLING FROM THE RDA PROCESS I

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:29.453 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:32.056 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LOOKING AT IT.

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:34.825 region:rollup2
AND THEN I DID MENTIONS SOME

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:36.227 region:rollup2
TRUST ISSUES ARE YOU KNOW THESE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.795 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TOOLS ARE REALLY

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:40.498 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT MAYBE ARE A FORTY

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:41.766 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR INVESTMENT AND AND IF

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:43.334 region:rollup2
THE CITY'S GONNA PUT ITS

00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:45.336 region:rollup2
RESOURCES INTO SOMETHING FOR THE

00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:46.270 region:rollup2
LONG HAUL. BUT THEY REALLY DON'T

00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:50.341 region:rollup2
WANT THE RULES CHANGED ON AND.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:53.411 region:rollup2
A LOT BECAUSE IT JUST IT IT WAS

00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:55.479 region:rollup2
SO I THINK AS WE WORK ON THIS I

00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:58.015 region:rollup2
THINK UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THERE

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:58.482 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE A LITTLE MORE.

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.450 region:rollup2
.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.418 region:rollup2
WE'RE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP THAT

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.085 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU EMBARK IN INTRO TO

00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2
USE ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT THE

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:02.887 region:rollup2
RULES ARE GONNA BE RADICALLY

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:05.056 region:rollup2
CHANGED ON YOU.

00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:06.657 region:rollup2
HALFWAY INTO THAT PROCESS OR

00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:09.126 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS GOING ON WITH

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:10.361 region:rollup2
CITIES ARM OR THERE'S THAT WHILE

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:11.562 region:rollup2
THE STATE BUDGET IS DOING BETTER

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:13.664 region:rollup2
THAN A LOT OF OUR CITIES OUR

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:14.765 region:rollup2
TIMES ARE NOT SO GOOD. ON A LOT

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:16.167 region:rollup2
OF OUR CITIES HAVEN'T REALLY

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:18.502 region:rollup2
REBOUNDED IN TERMS OF STAFFING

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:19.303 region:rollup2
SINCE THE RECESSION THEY REALLY

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:21.105 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T REFILL THOSE JOBS.

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:21.939 region:rollup2
YOU'VE ALL READ ABOUT SOME OF

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:23.441 region:rollup2
THE PENSION.

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.775 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF MANY OF OUR

00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:26.844 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE FACING.

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:28.813 region:rollup2
THAT'S KINDA TIGHTENING UP ON

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:30.414 region:rollup2
ON A ON A FLEXIBILITY OF

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:31.716 region:rollup2
EXISTING REVENUE.

ECONOMY MARKET CHANGES OR OR

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.490 region:rollup2
KIND OF CHANGING WHERE THOSE

DOLLARS GO. PROPERTY TAX REALLY

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.761 region:rollup2
HASN'T REBOUNDED ARE IN A LOT OF

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:44.161 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I WAS WORKING WITH

00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:46.630 region:rollup2
ON.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:48.199 region:rollup2
AS A ANALYSTS FROM C. SOCK ON A

GIVE LATER THIS WEEK.

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:52.536 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:54.672 region:rollup2
C. SECOND SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:56.440 region:rollup2
OF COUNTIES THE PROPERTY TAX

00:47:54.672 --> 00:47:58.542 region:rollup2
REALLY HASN'T REBOUNDED SENSE

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.511 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE HEIGHTS OF OF OF.

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:02.346 region:rollup2
THE THE PRIOR ON A IN TWO

00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.948 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO WELLS IN

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:04.849 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES IN SOME AREAS THE

00:48:03.948 --> 00:48:06.584 region:rollup2
STATE ECONOMY IS GOING REALLY

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.219 region:rollup2
WELL THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK

00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:10.721 region:rollup2
TO A LOT OF OTHER SITUATIONS

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:11.322 region:rollup2
GOING ON. A IN THE STATE THERE'S

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:13.224 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF.

00:48:11.322 --> 00:48:14.759 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURES OUT OUTSIDE OF

00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:16.293 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING THAT IF THEY WENT

00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:17.027 region:rollup2
THROUGH CAN EVEN LIMIT OUR

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:18.362 region:rollup2
ABILITY.

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:21.065 region:rollup2
ARE EVEN MORE.

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:22.032 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING GOING ON WITH

00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:23.234 region:rollup2
WITH CITIES WHEN LOOK AT THESE

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:25.169 region:rollup2
TOOLS IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:26.570 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF. OF WHAT'S THE

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:28.439 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THE SALES ARE A

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.974 region:rollup2
PART OF THE THE PROPERTY TAX

00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:32.109 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARMED COMMUNITY GETS

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:32.610 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF CITIES MAY GET

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:35.479 region:rollup2
FIVE TEN PERCENT FIFTEEN

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:38.215 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:40.050 region:rollup2
SO IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT YOU

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:42.853 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU ALL

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:45.089 region:rollup2
VERY LONG TIME BEFORE YOU OFTEN

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:47.091 region:rollup2
OF FINANCIAL LIFT TO GET

00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
ANYTHING DONE SO.

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:53.063 region:rollup2
OTHER YOU KNOW IT IT IN LESS

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.430 region:rollup2
YOU CAN REALLY PARTNER WITH

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.665 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ENTITY.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.699 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO A A DETERRENT.

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.400 region:rollup2
AND SAW IT IN THE END I THINK

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:56.901 region:rollup2
WE'LL PROBABLY HEAR FROM SOME OF

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.501 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES AND SPECIAL

00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:58.135 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS A LITTLE BIT LATER

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:58.803 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN MISSIONS

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.637 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CHALLENGES

00:48:58.803 --> 00:49:01.338 region:rollup2
AND OBLIGATIONS.

00:48:59.637 --> 00:49:03.774 region:rollup2
AND AND THEY'RE GONNA BE CAREFUL

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:05.609 region:rollup2
AT AS TO WHAT THE INVEST IN IT

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.944 region:rollup2
IT IN WHEN IT COMES TO I THINK

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.479 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:10.448 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA SEE BETWEEN. THE I

00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:11.582 region:rollup2
F. DE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CUT IT

00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.783 region:rollup2
AS I SAID THE WHERE DOES IT

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:14.018 region:rollup2
REALLY MATTER ITS POLITICAL

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.252 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT IT COULD BE ONE

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:17.221 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE OR

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:18.923 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX.

00:49:17.221 --> 00:49:20.791 region:rollup2
I SEE MAYBE MORE PARTNERSHIP

00:49:18.923 --> 00:49:22.326 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN CITIES AND

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.427 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.296 region:rollup2
ON ON SOME E. I. F. DE

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:26.797 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE THINGS. IT'S

00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:29.600 region:rollup2
HARDER FOR ME TO SEE.

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:31.202 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.704 region:rollup2
YEAH IT WOULD YOU KNOW WORKING

00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:35.039 region:rollup2
ON FIXING DOWNTOWN I MEAN THAT

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:37.174 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE TRADITIONAL

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:39.009 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT. ARM.

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:41.011 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES GOING

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:42.613 region:rollup2
FORWARD THERE'S A?

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.848 region:rollup2
WITH ANY OF THESE NEW TOOLS YOU

00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:45.115 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE TO USE

00:49:43.848 --> 00:49:46.217 region:rollup2
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND COMMON

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:49.053 region:rollup2
GROUND WITH THE COUNTY SEE IF

00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:51.021 region:rollup2
YOU CAN FIND. COMMON GROUND WITH

00:49:49.053 --> 00:49:52.256 region:rollup2
SPECIAL DISTRICT. I THINK WE'RE

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.591 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WE LIKE TO SEE

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:55.125 region:rollup2
WHERE WE COULD FIND COMMON

00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:56.627 region:rollup2
GROUND WITH THE STATE. AND WHAT

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:57.928 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE AREAS THAT THAT WE

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:59.997 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S COMMON GROUND

00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:01.532 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CITIES AND WHAT WE DO AS

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.867 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE URBAN CORES OF THE

00:50:01.532 --> 00:50:04.735 region:rollup2
STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:06.103 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED AREAS TRANSITORY

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:07.438 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT CARBON REDUCTION

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:09.006 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC

00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:11.008 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
IN ALSO SCHOOLS BUT WHEN YOU

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:14.712 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT ON A SMART GROWTH

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.513 region:rollup2
INFILL DEVELOPMENT ONE OF THE

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:17.014 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT'S ALWAYS WAS

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:18.382 region:rollup2
FORGOTTEN EVEN IN THE OLD

00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:19.850 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT TOOL WAS THE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:21.819 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF SCHOOLS BUT THEY WERE

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.120 region:rollup2
KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT SILO. SO

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:25.356 region:rollup2
IS I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD WITH

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.790 region:rollup2
THESE NEW TOOLS IS MAKING SURE

00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:28.192 region:rollup2
THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING A

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.160 region:rollup2
HAVING A REALLY GOOD QUALITY

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:31.762 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE A KEY TO

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.497 region:rollup2
KIND OF AN INFILL STRATEGY

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:34.431 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. IT REALLY BECOMES A

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:36.700 region:rollup2
MAGNET TO.

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:38.502 region:rollup2
TO TEQUILA TO ATTRACT AND

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.638 region:rollup2
RETAIN.

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:42.306 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO AND FAMILIES TO

00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:44.008 region:rollup2
LIVE IN THOSE AREAS SO THE

00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:45.509 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IS I THINK

00:50:44.008 --> 00:50:47.544 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF REALLY

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:49.513 region:rollup2
GOOD THINGS. THAT THAT ARE OUT

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:50.915 region:rollup2
THERE THEY CAN BE IMPROVED THESE

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:53.550 region:rollup2
TOLLS KOREA YA THEY CAN BE

00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:54.618 region:rollup2
IMPROVED. BUT LOOK LOOK FOR WAYS

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.086 region:rollup2
TO CONDUCT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.788 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HELP TO HAVE A BRAND NEW

00:50:56.086 --> 00:51:00.658 region:rollup2
TOOL YOU CAN BUILD OFF SOME OF

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:01.258 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK

00:51:00.658 --> 00:51:03.260 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY.

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER THING IS THE GAME

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.698 region:rollup2
CHANGER IN IS GOING TO BE.

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE IS

00:51:07.698 --> 00:51:12.570 region:rollup2
WILLING TO OPEN UP. A DISCUSSION

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:15.439 region:rollup2
OF ACCESSING THE SCHOOL SHARE

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.974 region:rollup2
ALL ON PROJECTS WHERE THEY WILL

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:18.108 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S COMMON GROUND IF

00:51:16.974 --> 00:51:19.610 region:rollup2
IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:21.145 region:rollup2
OF ITS TOT PROJECT OF ITS

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.080 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE THE

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:24.682 region:rollup2
AREAS OF COMMON GROUND. THE LET

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.849 region:rollup2
JUSTICE WE TALK AND TALK TO A

00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:27.117 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND THE COUNTY

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.986 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS OR THE SPECIAL

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:30.688 region:rollup2
DISTRICT BOARD CAN MAKE UP THEIR

00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:32.056 region:rollup2
OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEIR

00:51:30.688 --> 00:51:33.524 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES ARE AND WHETHER AND

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:35.125 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IS WORTH IT WOULD

00:51:33.524 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2
LIKE TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY THAT

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.962 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.563 region:rollup2
WITH. SOME ENTITY AT THE STATE

00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:41.699 region:rollup2
LEVEL STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:43.367 region:rollup2
IBEC SOME ENTITY WHERE IT WAS

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:45.436 region:rollup2
UNDER SOME PARAMETERS WE CAN

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:47.538 region:rollup2
MAYBE GET BACK TO SOMETHING

00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:49.106 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO THE OLD A CONCENTRATED

00:51:47.538 --> 00:51:50.608 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL LEFT. BEGIN WHAT'S

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:52.142 region:rollup2
GONNA BE DIFFERENT IT'S GONNA BE

00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:53.944 region:rollup2
ON SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE ON

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:55.212 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THIS ARE WE DO

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.513 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND PEOPLE CAN DEBATE

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:58.482 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD. THOSE

00:51:56.513 --> 00:52:02.219 region:rollup2
ARE MY COMMENTS HAPPY ANSWER

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:04.188 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:05.689 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU AT MISS KERRIGAN

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:06.223 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT THE

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:08.559 region:rollup2
SUMMARY.

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:09.927 region:rollup2
I'VE A QUESTION REALLY MORE TO

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:11.528 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PANELISTS BUT.

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:12.763 region:rollup2
THERE WAS ONCE THE ONE THING I

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:15.265 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO MENTION FROM WHAT I

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:17.234 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. FOR E. IFT SINCE TWO

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:18.335 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY A HANDFUL

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:20.638 region:rollup2
OF CITIES HAVE ACTUALLY FORM

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:22.406 region:rollup2
THESE IN. THE CITY'S UNAWARE OF

00:52:20.638 --> 00:52:25.309 region:rollup2
OUR WEST SACRAMENTO LAVERNE AND

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:27.311 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO AND THEN FOR CREA.

00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:29.046 region:rollup2
SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWENTY

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:29.947 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN NO CITIES HAVE TAKEN

00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:32.182 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:33.350 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER TWO LAWS AJ'S

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.252 region:rollup2
IN THE FIFTIES.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.388 region:rollup2
THEY WERE BOTH OF FOR LAST

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:39.857 region:rollup2
YEAR'S SO THAT THE JURY IS STILL

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:40.924 region:rollup2
OUT. ARM I KNOW DAN YOU YOU LAID

00:52:39.857 --> 00:52:41.492 region:rollup2
OUT SO THE REASONS WHY THIS

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.460 region:rollup2
HASN'T HAPPENED BUT I WOULD

00:52:41.492 --> 00:52:44.128 region:rollup2
LOVE.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.629 region:rollup2
AND LET'S SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE

00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:47.097 region:rollup2
TO ADD HERE WITH THE OTHER

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:48.766 region:rollup2
PANELISTS JUST WHAT YOU THINK

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:50.234 region:rollup2
ARE THE BARRIERS FOR WHY THIS

00:52:48.766 --> 00:52:51.635 region:rollup2
HASN'T HAPPENED I HAVE WONDERED

00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:53.570 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE.

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:55.806 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE SET UP ARE

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.107 region:rollup2
TOO COMPLICATED. IF THE LACK OF

00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:58.642 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL SHARE HOW MUCH WHAT

00:52:57.107 --> 00:53:01.478 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT HAS HAD.

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:03.447 region:rollup2
I HAD NOT HEARD THE THE THE

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:05.549 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF OF STAFFING AND SORT

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:06.684 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE BUT

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:08.419 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT MUST BE AN

00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:10.187 region:rollup2
ISSUE BUT. JUST LOVE TO

00:53:08.419 --> 00:53:12.022 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT HAS BEEN.

00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:13.557 region:rollup2
WHAT IS BEEN THE REASON WHY

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
THESE POSTS REDEVELOPMENT TOOLS

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.660 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN THAT THE

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:18.195 region:rollup2
PICKUP AND I KNOW DAD YOU SPENT?

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.530 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME GOOD TIME EXPLAINING

00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.531 region:rollup2
THAT BUT BUT WHAT I'M REALLY FOR

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.732 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WANT ONE QUICK

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:24.168 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ARE I MEAN.

00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:25.269 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF IT IS ALL THE

00:53:24.168 --> 00:53:26.070 region:rollup2
THINGS I SAID.

00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:27.705 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.074 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT THOUGH THE

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:32.709 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SHARE IS IS IS A KEY

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:33.711 region:rollup2
INGREDIENT. AND ARM I REALLY

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:35.846 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT

00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:37.414 region:rollup2
THE GAME CHANGER IN IN TERMS OF

00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:39.616 region:rollup2
GETTING INTO SOME OF THESE TOOLS

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:42.052 region:rollup2
ALL THE OTHER THING IS. IT TAKES

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:43.253 region:rollup2
AWHILE IF IF IT IS A CITY IS

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:45.022 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO GO TALK TO THE

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:46.223 region:rollup2
COUNTY. TALK TO A SPECIAL

00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:47.658 region:rollup2
DISTRICT TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF

00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:49.226 region:rollup2
THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT CAN TAKE

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:50.994 region:rollup2
A WHILE TALK TO YOUR COMMUNITY

00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:52.329 region:rollup2
SO SO EVEN THOSE WHAT THESE LAWS

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:54.264 region:rollup2
ARE YOU KNOW MAYBE A COUPLE

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:56.133 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD. THAT PROCESS THE OF

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:57.735 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRYING

00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:59.503 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF THERE'S COMMON GROUND

00:53:57.735 --> 00:54:00.537 region:rollup2
TAKES A WHILE THERE'S A LOT WELL

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:01.905 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO OR THREE MAYBE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:04.108 region:rollup2
FORMED THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:05.476 region:rollup2
UNDER EXPLORATION BUT BUT I DO

00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:08.278 region:rollup2
THINK IT WILL TAKE AWHILE. ARE

00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:10.747 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR EVEN IF ALL IT EVEN IF

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:13.817 region:rollup2
THE WILL WAS THERE BECAUSE I I

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:16.653 region:rollup2
THINK THIS REQUIRES MORE UP

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:22.159 region:rollup2
FRONT COOPERATIVE DISCUSSIONS

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:22.693 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE OTHER TOOL WHICH YOU

00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:23.427 region:rollup2
JUST FOLLOWED A STATUTE.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.128 region:rollup2
AND ONE SUMMER THAT WOULD BE

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:24.728 region:rollup2
GREAT AT SOME POINT IF YOU DON'T

00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:25.829 region:rollup2
HAVE THE INFORMATION TODAY I'D

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.830 region:rollup2
LOVE TO SEE IF YOU KNOW. WHAT

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.464 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ENGAGING

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.465 region:rollup2
AYE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS SUCH

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.600 region:rollup2
THAT IN A FEW YEARS MAYBE OTHERS

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.901 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOUGHT

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.937 region:rollup2
YEAH I HAVE TO EASE OUR CREUS?

00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:34.471 region:rollup2
SO WE AYE. SERVED IT JUST A

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.372 region:rollup2
GENERAL QUESTION AS WE GO

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.373 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PANEL.

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:37.674 region:rollup2
SO NEXT SAW WELCOME ERIC

ARE.

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:51.021 region:rollup2
A LOT OF MY COMMENTS ARE GONNA

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:51.789 region:rollup2
ACCO VERY CLOSELY THAT THE

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:56.260 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT.

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:58.962 region:rollup2
DAN JUST MADE AS IT RELATES TO.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.531 region:rollup2
MOST SPECIFICALLY THE EF I D.

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SEEN

00:55:00.531 --> 00:55:05.068 region:rollup2
DIEGO WHY WE CHOSE TO USE IT.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:07.137 region:rollup2
WHY WE'VE CHOSEN TO USE IT AND

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:08.472 region:rollup2
JUST ONE SPECIFIC AREA AND OF

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.973 region:rollup2
COURSE I AM HAPPY TO SPEAK TO

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:11.642 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES?

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.976 region:rollup2
RELATED TO CREATE AS WELL I

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:15.312 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD DAM DID AN EXCELLENT

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
JOB OF SUMMARIZING IS THAT WITH

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:18.081 region:rollup2
THE LANDSCAPE IN TERMS OF

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:19.883 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:20.250 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT POSED DISSOLUTION OF

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:22.019 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.020 region:rollup2
AFTER WE.

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:24.521 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:26.757 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS WHAT THROUGH THE

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:28.725 region:rollup2
STAGES OF GRIEF WHAT THE END OF

00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:31.495 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT IT REALLY FORCED

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:33.831 region:rollup2
US TO BE MORE CREATIVE. AND MORE

00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:34.932 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE AND TO WHAT I LIKE TO

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:37.401 region:rollup2
CALL STACK

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:38.969 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND TOOLS WAS

00:55:37.401 --> 00:55:41.271 region:rollup2
NO LONGER ONE TOOL IN THE

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:43.807 region:rollup2
TOOLBOX THAT WE COULD GO TO. AND

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:45.809 region:rollup2
TIME AFTER TIME AGAIN USE IT AS

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:47.444 region:rollup2
A MULTI TOOL TO SOLVE A WIDE

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:50.080 region:rollup2
ARRAY OF PROBLEMS

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:51.348 region:rollup2
NOW REQUIRES YOU TO LOOK AT THE

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.217 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE

00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.985 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE. AND THEN LATER

00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:56.086 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TOOLS THAT THE STATE

00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:57.454 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THAT THE FEDERAL

00:55:56.086 --> 00:56:00.057 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES IN

00:55:57.454 --> 00:56:03.193 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING OUR CBG DOLLARS AND

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:04.728 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT. HOW WE LEVERAGE JE

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:05.996 region:rollup2
LOCAL INCENTIVES MANY

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:08.031 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE CITY

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:09.132 region:rollup2
OF SAN DIEGO HAVE CREATED NEW

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:10.167 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND LOAN

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:11.835 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS

00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:13.070 region:rollup2
ALL FOCUSED ON CREW REBUILDING

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:15.105 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:16.607 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT TOOL BOX?

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:18.642 region:rollup2
INTO SOMETHING THAT IS

00:56:16.607 --> 00:56:21.044 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL AND USEFUL.

00:56:18.642 --> 00:56:22.479 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO OUR E. FID

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:25.282 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND WE CREATED

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:27.217 region:rollup2
OUR YOU HAVE ID AND JULY OF

00:56:25.282 --> 00:56:28.919 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE EXPECT THE

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:31.355 region:rollup2
FIRST TEE I TAX INCREMENT

00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:33.190 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO FLOW INTO THE CITY.

00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:34.458 region:rollup2
IN JULY OF THIS YEAR WERE

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:35.792 region:rollup2
EXPECTING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.628 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:38.595 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS THAT RAMP UP TO ABOUT

00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:41.598 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION.

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:43.133 region:rollup2
WE ARE USING IF ID'S AND WERE

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:46.370 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

00:56:43.133 --> 00:56:48.338 region:rollup2
TOOL. BUT WE'RE USING IT AS A

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:49.706 region:rollup2
AYE I ACTUALLY WROTE THIS DOWN.

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:51.041 region:rollup2
WOULD DAM CALLED STRATEGIC

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:52.876 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OR

00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:54.111 region:rollup2
SURGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:55.379 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S VERY MUCH OF THE WAY

00:56:54.111 --> 00:56:56.747 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:59.416 region:rollup2
SO FOR US THERE'S A COMMUNITY

00:56:56.747 --> 00:57:01.051 region:rollup2
ALL TIME MESA IN SAN DIEGO. JUST

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:03.520 region:rollup2
RIGHT ALONG THE BORDER LARGE

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:05.389 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF UNDER DEVELOPED

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.357 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL LAND.

00:57:05.389 --> 00:57:09.259 region:rollup2
WE TOOK FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:11.728 region:rollup2
ACRES OF THAT LAND AND PUT IT

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:13.230 region:rollup2
INTO A E. F. I. D..

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:15.265 region:rollup2
AND WERE ESSENTIALLY FUNDING

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.667 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:18.535 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT COMMUNITY A BETTER

00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:20.070 region:rollup2
PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE BETTER

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.704 region:rollup2
PLACE IN WHICH AND VAST. BUT

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:24.708 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:27.678 region:rollup2
.

00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:28.979 region:rollup2
IT IT'S I WOULD SAY THE DEEP.

00:57:27.678 --> 00:57:30.414 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE CHALLENGE FOR US WOULD

00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:31.748 region:rollup2
BE FID.

00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:33.083 region:rollup2
AND WHY IT WORKED IN THAT

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.551 region:rollup2
LOCATION BUT NOT AND OTHER

00:57:33.083 --> 00:57:35.752 region:rollup2
PLACES IN THE CITIES BECAUSE THE

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:37.688 region:rollup2
CITY.

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:39.022 region:rollup2
HAD A VESTED INTEREST IN MOVING

00:57:37.688 --> 00:57:40.791 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH THAT THAT

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:42.859 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ANYWAY.

00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:44.328 region:rollup2
IBF IDEAS A TOOL THAT

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:45.762 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS US TO TAKE

00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:48.131 region:rollup2
OUR OWN REVENUES THAT ARE COMING

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:49.566 region:rollup2
IN. AND SIPHON THEM OFF PUT THEM

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:50.767 region:rollup2
INTO A BOX THAT CANNOT BE

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:52.469 region:rollup2
TOUCHED.

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:53.570 region:rollup2
AS THE CITY AND ENCOUNTERS

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:55.138 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN THE

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.974 region:rollup2
FUTURE SO THAT IS DEDICATED

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:57.908 region:rollup2
TOWARDS SCHOOLS THOSE.

00:57:56.974 --> 00:57:59.910 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT.

00:57:57.908 --> 00:58:02.012 region:rollup2
WE LAID OUT IN THE FORMATION.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:04.181 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:58:02.012 --> 00:58:04.815 region:rollup2
IN THE FORMATION OF OUR IF ID WE

00:58:04.181 --> 00:58:06.283 region:rollup2
DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:07.985 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:10.721 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME TO

00:58:07.985 --> 00:58:12.089 region:rollup2
THE TABLE AND EVEN EXPAND THE

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:14.057 region:rollup2
BORDERS OF THE DISTRICT INTO THE

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:15.859 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED AREA WHICH

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:18.161 region:rollup2
BORDERS THE AREA.

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:19.763 region:rollup2
AND OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.932 region:rollup2
UNSUCCESSFUL I THINK THAT THAT

00:58:19.763 --> 00:58:23.467 region:rollup2
IS A DEFINITIVELY APPOINT AS THE

00:58:21.932 --> 00:58:26.503 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

00:58:23.467 --> 00:58:29.172 region:rollup2
THINKS ABOUT HOW TO REFORM THIS

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:31.675 region:rollup2
TOOL. AND DANCE COMMENTS WERE I

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:33.410 region:rollup2
THINK SPOT ON IN THE SENSE THAT.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:35.178 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN AGREE

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.680 region:rollup2
I AM AND PRIORITIES THAT MAYBE

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:37.981 region:rollup2
REGIONAL IN NATURE STATEWIDE IN

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.183 region:rollup2
NATURE.

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:42.252 region:rollup2
AND HOW OF THE.

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:45.188 region:rollup2
BOTH MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL AS

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:46.623 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND THE STATE ALL

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:48.191 region:rollup2
AGREED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:50.026 region:rollup2
SOME SHARING OF REVENUE.

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:52.362 region:rollup2
AND ORDERED THERE'S IT LEAST

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:54.030 region:rollup2
MORE OF AN INCENTIVE.

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:55.799 region:rollup2
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IF THE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:57.167 region:rollup2
ROLES WERE BEEN REVERSED AND THE

00:58:55.799 --> 00:58:59.269 region:rollup2
COUNTY CAME TO US AND SAID WE

00:58:57.167 --> 00:59:00.437 region:rollup2
WANT TO FOR MANY IF ID AND WE

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:02.939 region:rollup2
WANT SOME OF THE CITY'S REVENUE.

00:59:00.437 --> 00:59:04.341 region:rollup2
FOR OUR PRIORITIES THAT ARE

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:06.410 region:rollup2
ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN YES.

00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:07.544 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:08.979 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS ARE LOOKING OUT

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:09.846 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR THEIR OWN INTERESTS

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:11.848 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:13.383 region:rollup2
IN THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:15.018 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN TELL YOU IF THERE WAS

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.753 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE FOR US TO SIT DOWN

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WHERE WE

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:19.790 region:rollup2
COULD SAY LET'S THINK REGIONALLY

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:22.059 region:rollup2
LET'S THINK ABOUT.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.527 region:rollup2
MAYBE WHAT AND AFFORDABLE

00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:26.129 region:rollup2
HOUSING PROJECTS OR.

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:27.431 region:rollup2
BRINGING IN A LARGE EMPLOYER

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:28.765 region:rollup2
AND BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:31.301 region:rollup2
THAT THAT EMPLOYER NEEDS OR

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:33.270 region:rollup2
COMPLETING ROADS AND AND SORT OF

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:34.805 region:rollup2
LIKE WE ARE AND AN ALL TIME MESA

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:36.573 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WOULD HAVE ON OTHER

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:38.275 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN AREAS OUTSIDE

00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.875 region:rollup2
OF THE DISTRICT. I THINK THAT

00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:39.843 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A HELPFUL THING

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:41.344 region:rollup2
TO.

00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:43.346 region:rollup2
TO CONTEMPLATE.

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:44.714 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY.

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:44.915 region:rollup2
WHEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:47.384 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:59:44.915 --> 00:59:49.186 region:rollup2
.

00:59:47.384 --> 00:59:50.554 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT HAVING ANY IF ID

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:52.622 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:53.790 region:rollup2
OTHER INSTANCES OF POTENTIALLY

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:55.725 region:rollup2
HOW TO USE THIS IN THE CITY OF

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:57.661 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE MAJOR

00:59:55.725 --> 01:00:00.130 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THAT I I WON'T NAME

00:59:57.661 --> 01:00:01.798 region:rollup2
ENDS AND RIGHT NOW BUT. THAT

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.799 region:rollup2
HAVE LOOKED AT COULD THEY USE

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:04.034 region:rollup2
THIS ON THEIR CAMPUS TO

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:05.102 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE TRAFFIC

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:07.971 region:rollup2
ISSUES

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:09.639 region:rollup2
THAT. THEIR EMPLOYEES MAY BE AND

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.841 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTERING AS I GET OFF THE

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:12.175 region:rollup2
FREEWAY AND AND AND TRY TO GET

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:14.311 region:rollup2
TO WORK.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:16.146 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A ONE STOP TOOL I THINK

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.647 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT.

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:19.382 region:rollup2
STACKING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:21.885 region:rollup2
AS THE ASSEMBLY CREATES NEW

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:23.720 region:rollup2
TOOLS REFINES TOOLS I THINK IT'S

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:24.321 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS DAN MENTIONED TO

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.490 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TOOLS ARE

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:27.924 region:rollup2
WORKING. IN CONCERT WITH EACH

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.160 region:rollup2
OTHER THAT CITIES HAVE THE

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:32.129 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TAILOR THEIR TOOLS.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.662 region:rollup2
AND LEVERAGE FEDERL DOLLARS TO

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.598 region:rollup2
WORK IN CONCERT WITH THESE

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:36.032 region:rollup2
TOOLS.

01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:38.969 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT DOES WORK

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:40.504 region:rollup2
WITH THE F. ID IS THAT.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.605 region:rollup2
THIS IS DEFINITELY A TOOL THAT

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:43.373 region:rollup2
GIVES WHAT I CALL SUB LOCAL

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:44.774 region:rollup2
CONTROL.

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
IT IS GIVING AN EMPOWERING

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.911 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WERE SMALLER

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.346 region:rollup2
PORTIONS WITHIN A COMMUNITY.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:51.114 region:rollup2
IT LEAST IN THE IN SAN DIEGO'S

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:53.550 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION INSTANCE THE

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:54.951 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO SET A PATH WHERE

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.686 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PROJECTS HAVE A

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:58.155 region:rollup2
DEFINITIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.523 region:rollup2
INTO THE FUTURE REGARDLESS OF

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.857 region:rollup2
HOW POLITICS MAY CHANGE

01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:03.226 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF HOW PRIORITIES

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:04.828 region:rollup2
CHANGE IT GIVES US A MECHANISM

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.228 region:rollup2
TO LOCK BOX THAT IN.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.631 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY GOOD.

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:09.466 region:rollup2
.

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.934 region:rollup2
IN IN CLOSING.

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:13.169 region:rollup2
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE F. ID

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT IS A VERY SPECIAL

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:17.507 region:rollup2
SURGICAL TOOL. IT IS A GOOD TOOL

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:19.709 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:21.478 region:rollup2
GIVING INCENTIVES TO

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:22.579 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES IN THE COUNTY AND

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:24.281 region:rollup2
OPENING THE DOOR FOR A

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE IS

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:26.883 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULD GREATLY

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.385 region:rollup2
ALLOWS TO USE THAT TOOL EVEN

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.753 region:rollup2
MORE. WHEN.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.921 region:rollup2
.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:33.223 region:rollup2
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CREE IRON

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:34.958 region:rollup2
Y. THE CITY HAS AND USE CREA

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:36.459 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A TOOL THAT WE WE DID

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:38.562 region:rollup2
AN EXTENSIVE STUDY IN THE LATTER

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:40.497 region:rollup2
PART OF LAST YEAR. LOOKING AT

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:43.700 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL USING THAT TOOL NOTS

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:44.267 region:rollup2
MEDLEY IT IT. WAS AN ISSUE OF.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.138 region:rollup2
TAKING FUNDS JUST CITY FUNDS

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:49.506 region:rollup2
AND.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:51.007 region:rollup2
PRESUMING THAT WE COULDN'T GET

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:52.676 region:rollup2
TO AN AGREEMENT WHAT ARE COUNTY

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:55.879 region:rollup2
IT WOULD JUST LOCK BOX ARE FUNDS

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:57.247 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT CASE YOU HAVE A MORE

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.448 region:rollup2
COMPLEX GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.617 region:rollup2
THAT ESSENTIALLY WOULD BE TAKING

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.618 region:rollup2
CITY FUNDS FOR CITY PRIORITIES

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:03.420 region:rollup2
AND TURNING THEM OVER TO A

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:05.121 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT IS

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.790 region:rollup2
LARGELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL.

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:08.091 region:rollup2
SO IN CLOSING I.

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:10.460 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:15.625 region:rollup2

JURISDICTIONS FUNDING. AND IF

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:36.746 region:rollup2

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:45.281 region:rollup2
OLD DAYS WHEN I'M HEARING IS THE

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:46.616 region:rollup2
US IN THESE OTHER TOOLS ARE AS

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.851 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.352 region:rollup2
AS I THOUGHT THEM TO BE IN GIVE

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:50.487 region:rollup2
ME THAT'S MY OWN PERSONAL BIAS

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.588 region:rollup2
HAVING REMEMBERED WHAT IT IS TO

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.223 region:rollup2
HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:56.025 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF TAX INCREMENT.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:56.526 region:rollup2
BY TAKING AWAY THAT MAYBE THIS

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.961 region:rollup2
IS BETTER AND PERHAPS.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF WHAT I SEE IS ACTUAL

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.764 region:rollup2
RESULTS IS PRACTICE THESE ARE

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:01.264 region:rollup2
STILL IN THEIR INFANCY IS THAT A

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:04.033 region:rollup2
FAIR TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.567 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.170 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:08.571 region:rollup2
JUST TO GREAT EXTENT YES WE ARE

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.506 region:rollup2
STILL FIGURING OUT HOW THESE

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.974 region:rollup2
TOOLS WORK WHERE THEY WORK

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:14.210 region:rollup2
PASSED.

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:15.712 region:rollup2
ANY DAN AS AS.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.280 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERYONE LOOKED AT

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:18.848 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AS IF WE'RE

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.382 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.683 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOOL

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:22.485 region:rollup2
CHEST.

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:24.120 region:rollup2
IT WAS THE POWER SAW YOU KNOW

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:26.589 region:rollup2
THAT COULD CUT THROUGH ANYTHING.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.690 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEFT WORK

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.858 region:rollup2
SINCE THE DISSOLUTION OF

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.827 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT ARE SOME REALLY

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:32.495 region:rollup2
FINE HAND TOOLS.

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:34.330 region:rollup2
YOU CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH IT BUT

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.832 region:rollup2
NOW YOU MIGHT NEED TO USE TWO OR

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.867 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:39.402 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:41.805 region:rollup2
WOULD WE'D JANET MENTIONED IN

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:43.173 region:rollup2
HIS PRESENTATION THAT ASSEMBLAGE

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:44.674 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW USING EMINENT DOMAIN

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:46.409 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLING PROPERTIES BEING ABLE

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:48.511 region:rollup2
TO SIT ON THOSE PROPERTIES WHILE

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:49.846 region:rollup2
YOU. YOU ASSEMBLE ADDITIONAL

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:53.616 region:rollup2
PARCELS AND THEN BRING IT

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:53.616 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND OFFER IT TO A

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.619 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BILL THAT AFFORDABLE

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:59.222 region:rollup2
HOUSING WITH SOME DEGREE OF

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:01.257 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT OR FAVORABLE TERMS? IT

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:02.559 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT UNDER

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:03.927 region:rollup2
ANY IF ID YOU CAN BUILDING

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:06.296 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE YOU

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:07.297 region:rollup2
CAN. WORK ON AN EXISTING PROJECT

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.998 region:rollup2
WHEN I TALK TO AFFORDABLE

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.532 region:rollup2
HOUSING DEVELOPERS TODAY

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.868 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLAGES THE NUMBER ONE

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.402 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.403 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE FACING IN SAN

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:15.271 region:rollup2
DIEGO.

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:16.906 region:rollup2
I LOVE THE ANALOGY SO THANK YOU

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.908 region:rollup2
FOR HAVING. CONVERTED TO THAT

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:20.210 region:rollup2
FAIRLY QUICKLY ARM MAYBE JUST A

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:22.045 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP IN AND I REALIZE THIS

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.112 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE AS A BENEFICIAL TO MY

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:24.414 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES ARE GOING UP HIS

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:27.283 region:rollup2
FAVOR A FAMILIAR WITH A TEN MESA

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:27.851 region:rollup2
OTHER AFTER YESTERDAY PUBLIC ARE

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:28.084 region:rollup2
FAIRLY WELL FAMILIAR AT THIS

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:28.618 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:29.886 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:31.654 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:33.756 region:rollup2
AIR KEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEING

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.624 region:rollup2
BUILT WITH THIS WAS NO THAT WAS

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:36.459 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TRUMP BORDER WALL

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:38.394 region:rollup2
THING INSIDE OUT. INSIDE JOKE

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:39.395 region:rollup2
COMEDY ROUTINE.

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:41.364 region:rollup2
ERIC KNOWS THIS YET EIGHT YEARS

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:42.031 region:rollup2
OF IT WITH ME AT. ALL

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.966 region:rollup2
GITA WHICH A BUILDING DOWN AND I

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:45.335 region:rollup2
GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:46.402 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE EF

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.071 region:rollup2
ID ON ATTENDANCE.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.873 region:rollup2
SO THIS WAS AN AREA THAT HAD

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:50.840 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER INVESTED

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:52.842 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO CITY

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.409 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SO LOOKING AT OUR

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.512 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FACILITIES FINANCING

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:57.680 region:rollup2
PLAN.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.882 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY IS

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.184 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT YOU HAVE

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:03.620 region:rollup2
IDEAS FINANCING SO NO LONGER

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.954 region:rollup2
WILL WE BE ABLE TO NOT FINANCE

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.323 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS WE HAVE A DEDICATED

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:09.359 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCE. TO BUILD ROADS

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:11.394 region:rollup2
AND SEWERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:13.396 region:rollup2
AREN'T CHEAP TO YOUR POINT THIS

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.330 region:rollup2
AREA BEING ALONG THE US MEXICO

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.632 region:rollup2
BORDER.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:17.500 region:rollup2
IT IS FIVE HUNDRED TEN ACRES OF

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:19.402 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.871 region:rollup2
LAST REMAINING PARCELS WHERE YOU

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:23.339 region:rollup2
CAN BILLS INDUSTRIAL IN THE CITY

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:26.042 region:rollup2
OF SAN DIEGO.

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:27.110 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF IT IS RAW LAND A LOT

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.779 region:rollup2
OF IT IS VACANT.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:31.548 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT WAS JUST RECENTLY

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.582 region:rollup2
ZONE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME SO

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:34.017 region:rollup2
BUILDING UP TO SEWER IN THE

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.952 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:37.320 region:rollup2
IS GREATLY NEEDED. AND THAT'S

01:07:35.952 --> 01:07:38.855 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE REASON THESE FUNDS FOR

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.123 region:rollup2
LIVE SUPER HELPFUL BECAUSE AND I

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.157 region:rollup2
THINK IT AND GET IN THE OLD DAYS

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.659 region:rollup2
ON PROJECT AREA YOU'RE THINKING

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:43.960 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT PROJECT WHAT PARK

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:45.261 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU TRY TO BUILD.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.262 region:rollup2
MYSTIFICATION BILLION UP OF

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:48.264 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:49.599 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT IN

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.466 region:rollup2
MEMORY SERVES YOU COULDN'T THERE

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.001 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ROADS WE COULDN'T

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.102 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:54.504 region:rollup2
DRAINAGE AND OTHER ISSUES THAT

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:56.105 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT WERE BARRIERS TO

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:57.373 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT SO.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.608 region:rollup2
THAT A IF ID DELIVERS HIS

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.976 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THING YOUR HOPE

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:01.544 region:rollup2
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THIS PRIME

01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:03.212 region:rollup2
LOCATION IN ITS IN ITS POTENTIAL

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:04.581 region:rollup2
USE THAT TO GET THE PRIVATE

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.748 region:rollup2
SECTOR DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WORTHY

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:08.384 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE OF THAT. THE

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.319 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES INVESTMENT IN THIS

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.053 region:rollup2
DISTRICT CRAP.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.454 region:rollup2
BOB WELL AGAIN I WOULD JUST

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:12.055 region:rollup2
MENTION TO BOTH MY COLLEAGUES TO

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:12.956 region:rollup2
CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE I MEAN

I THINK I I IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.295 region:rollup2
HELPFUL HERE AGAIN OF THIS MAY

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.330 region:rollup2
BE MORE USEFUL THAN I THOUGHT IT

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.698 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.298 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.434 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:26.302 region:rollup2
WONDERFULLY FIXATED ON YOUR

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.970 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THE POWER TOOL A

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:29.672 region:rollup2
NEVER HEARD.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:31.407 region:rollup2
EFTS DESCRIBED THAT WAY ONE OF

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:32.575 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD AS

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.676 region:rollup2
TO WHY IT HASN'T BEEN MORE

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:35.511 region:rollup2
WIDELY USED IS IS JUST NOT

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:37.580 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INCREMENT ORDER PUT USING

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
ALGAE. IT'S ONE POWER TOOL TO

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.217 region:rollup2
TRY TO BUILD THOUSANDS OF UNITS

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:43.786 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING IS JUST NOT ENOUGH.

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:45.188 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.724 region:rollup2
INSIEME DIEGO'S.

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:48.791 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:50.126 region:rollup2
ON WHEN YOU LAUNCH IT IN WHERE

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.728 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ESTABLISHING THAT BASE

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.895 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT THAT WAS AN ISSUE AS

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:54.530 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT YOU HAVE ID

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.399 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OTHER PARTS OF

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:58.067 region:rollup2
THE CITY. SPEND EVEN MORE OF AN

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.601 region:rollup2
ISSUE AS WE LOOKED AT CREE UP.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:01.571 region:rollup2
AND WE DID OUR ANALYSIS OF

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:03.172 region:rollup2
EVERY.

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:04.707 region:rollup2
CENSUS TRACT THAT WE COULD PUT

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.875 region:rollup2
INTO A CREA AND ULTIMATELY

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:09.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP WITH

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:10.246 region:rollup2
USING BIDS JUST OUR OWN DOLLARS

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:10.713 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE CITY OF SAN

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.448 region:rollup2
DIEGO.

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:14.650 region:rollup2
AT

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.985 region:rollup2
IT IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH NEW

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:18.521 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL JUSTIFY THE CREATION

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:19.756 region:rollup2
OF THE ENTITY.

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.790 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU THAT SAID THAT'S

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:22.458 region:rollup2
FOR HELP AGAIN EDGE OF HER

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.427 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES THE FACT THAT. NOT A

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:25.128 region:rollup2
SINGLE CITY HAS FORMED A CREA

01:09:24.427 --> 01:09:27.497 region:rollup2
SINCE IT WAS.

01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:28.564 region:rollup2
STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.299 region:rollup2
I THINK IS A. BIT OF A FLAG

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.834 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH AGAIN IF YOU WERE IF IF

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:33.569 region:rollup2
THE PANELS AWARE OF CITIES THAT

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.971 region:rollup2
ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.205 region:rollup2
CREATORE I'VE HE'S BE HELPFUL

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.473 region:rollup2
FOR US TO KNOW THAT I KNOW

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.108 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AGO WAS LOOKING AT IT AND

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:40.243 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE SALINAS WAS LOOKING AT

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:42.278 region:rollup2
IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BUT I AGAIN I THINK

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.581 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU IT IT GETS. SOME OF THE

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:49.352 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS COMES BACK TO THE

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:50.386 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL LEFT ISSUE AND AND.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:52.255 region:rollup2
IT AND I AYE ON THESE

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:54.690 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER TAXI

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:56.059 region:rollup2
ENTITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:58.494 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS I MEAN.

01:09:56.059 --> 01:10:00.029 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T IT.

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:01.831 region:rollup2
S. STARKLY THERE NEVER WERE SUCH

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.132 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS SO THIS IS A BRAND

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:04.667 region:rollup2
NEW CONVERSATION THAT'S BEING

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:06.002 region:rollup2
OUT AND REMEMBER WE'RE JUST

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:07.103 region:rollup2
FINISHING UP THE REDEVELOPMENT

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:08.404 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHICH WAS PRETTY

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:10.273 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL AND THERE'S A LOT

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:11.207 region:rollup2
ATTENTION SO. I THINK THERE

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.208 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BUILD A BIT MORE

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:14.043 region:rollup2
BREATHING ROOM AT MAYBE IN THE

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.211 region:rollup2
FUTURE A COUNTIES AND AND

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:23.720 region:rollup2
SPECIAL DISTRICTS MARTZ MIGHT

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:25.655 region:rollup2
START SEEING OPPORTUNITIES THAT.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.823 region:rollup2
BUT SOME IT IT I THINK WITH ALL

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.924 region:rollup2
THESE TOOLS I THINK IT'S A

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:30.093 region:rollup2
LITTLE EARLY THAT THEY'RE THAT

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:32.161 region:rollup2

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:33.529 region:rollup2
UP IN AND GET THE BY AND.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:35.398 region:rollup2
ONE LAST QUESTION FOR HIS FATHER

BUT IT DOES REQUIRE VOTER

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:39.515 region:rollup2
APPROVAL AND SO YOU REALLY NEED

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:41.117 region:rollup2
LARGE. AREAS OF LAND WE HAVE

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:43.552 region:rollup2
ELEVEN REGISTERED VOTERS ARE

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
FEWER. AND WE HAD ONE LANDOWNER

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.388 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN A

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.089 region:rollup2
LOT OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT OVER

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:48.257 region:rollup2
TIME TO REALLY BE ABLE TO PAY

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.592 region:rollup2
OFF THOSE THOSE BONDS THAT YOU

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.960 region:rollup2
DO ISSUE SO THAT. THE BOTTOM

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.862 region:rollup2
LINE FOR US IT'S IT'S LONG ONE

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.963 region:rollup2
PROCESS IN SHORT ON REVENUES

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:55.398 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GENERATING IN MOST

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:56.832 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE DOES WORK IN

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:59.302 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR I THINK IS A MILITARY

01:13:56.832 --> 01:14:01.070 region:rollup2
REUSE KINDS OF A PLAN. WE WE'RE

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:02.438 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE A LARGE OPEN SPACE

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.307 region:rollup2
WITH ONE LANDOWNER HAVE

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:06.175 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY LOTS OF VERY.

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
LUCRATIVE INVESTMENT COMING IN

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.811 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THAT YOU CAN THEN

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.379 region:rollup2
FUND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE KNOWING

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:11.914 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THAT TAX INCREMENT IS

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:14.016 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE GENERATED. BUT THERE

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:15.351 region:rollup2
WAS NO LO LO MAS SET ASIDE EVEN

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:17.053 region:rollup2
IN THE I FD BELIEVE IT OR NOT

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:18.888 region:rollup2
AMAZINGLY ENOUGH AFTER THE

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:20.523 region:rollup2
DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:21.457 region:rollup2
AND SO IT WAS BASICALLY OPTIONAL

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:25.094 region:rollup2
YOU COULD DO IT OR NOT SO WE'RE

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:25.528 region:rollup2
VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT IS

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.362 region:rollup2
THE I FD AS A TOOL.

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:27.196 region:rollup2
AND SO THEN WE LOOKED AT THE

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:29.131 region:rollup2
CREATES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.999 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT DAN AND OTHERS IN

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.300 region:rollup2
THE CBA.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:33.169 region:rollup2
DID WITH WITH FORMER

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.937 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS ALEJO WAS IT

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.339 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY GOOD WORK ON THE

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:37.373 region:rollup2
GROUND NAY KIND OF GRIND IT OUT.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:39.675 region:rollup2
I DID A YEOMAN'S JOB ON GETTING

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:40.109 region:rollup2
HIS CREOSOTE UP THE LIMITS OF

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.243 region:rollup2
THE CREE AS THOUGH.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:42.378 region:rollup2
.

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:44.046 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T OF DEAD MENTION THIS

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:45.247 region:rollup2
OR NOT BUT THERE REALLY TARGET

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:46.749 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:48.117 region:rollup2
HIGH INDICES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.318 region:rollup2
CRIME STATISTICS.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.953 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:52.188 region:rollup2
REALLY CAN'T BENEFIT FROM THEM

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:53.689 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:54.757 region:rollup2
THAT THEY TOOK THE LEAD TO BUILD

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.992 region:rollup2
A TOOL AND WORK WITH THE

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:57.593 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SEE WHAT THE

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.227 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR WAS WILLING TO SIGN.

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:59.595 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT WAS REALLY

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:01.530 region:rollup2
VALUABLE WORKS THAT'S WHY WE

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:02.565 region:rollup2
CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR WITH AB

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:04.200 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN NINETY ABLE ASSEMBLY

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:05.301 region:rollup2
MEMBER MULLIN. TO DO THESE

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.470 region:rollup2
HOUSING AUTHORITIES WHICH

01:15:05.301 --> 01:15:08.704 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY BUILT ON THE CREATE

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:10.473 region:rollup2
CONCEPT BUT THERE REALLY

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:12.007 region:rollup2
TARGETED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:14.010 region:rollup2
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELATED

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:15.144 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT DOESN'T

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.379 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.813 region:rollup2
LARGER KIND OF CAPITAL

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.215 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT PLANS THAT THE

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:20.716 region:rollup2
CITY'S HABIT SEPARATELY ALSO A

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:22.551 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS NEEDS THERE. AND A

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:24.020 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE THOSE COST BURDENS

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:25.187 region:rollup2
GET SHIFTED TO NEW DEVELOPMENT.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.622 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.490 region:rollup2
FUND THESE KIND A MAJOR

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:30.426 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.893 region:rollup2
CITIES NEED TO UNDERTAKE THAT'S

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:32.528 region:rollup2
BEEN EXACERBATED BY.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:34.663 region:rollup2
THE SLASHING OF OF THE HOME IN

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:36.098 region:rollup2
CBG FUNDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:37.666 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY EVEN MORE THAN EVER.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.701 region:rollup2
WE TO STRONG STATE PARTNER TO

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.035 region:rollup2
STEPIN AND HELP US TO DO

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.237 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.304 region:rollup2
THE FEDS ARE NOT HERE TO HELP

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:43.339 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S GOING IN

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:45.474 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU KNOW

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:46.942 region:rollup2
EXPECT. EVEN DEEPER CUTS TO

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.511 region:rollup2
TEHAMA CITY BG IN TERMS OF OF

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:50.279 region:rollup2
THOSE KEY TOOLS ANDFINANCING

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:51.614 region:rollup2
FOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.548 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:15:51.614 --> 01:15:53.883 region:rollup2
LOCALLY THOUGH SOME

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.518 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS HAVE HAD THAT THE

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:57.353 region:rollup2
WILL POLITICAL WILL TO STEP UP

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:59.188 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE JURISDICTIONS TO DO

01:15:57.353 --> 01:16:00.222 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE TAX.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.891 region:rollup2
AND VOTERS HAVE ACTUALLY VOTED

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:04.260 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE IN OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.494 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF SAN MATEO. TO TRY

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.029 region:rollup2
TO HELP BACKFILL SOME OF THAT.

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:08.230 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SAW ON THE PENINSULA

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:10.399 region:rollup2
IN THE BAY AREA.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.934 region:rollup2
IS TREMENDOUS NEW COMMERCIAL

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.468 region:rollup2
OFFICE DEVELOPMENT COMING ONLINE

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.702 region:rollup2
SO WASN'T A QUESTION ABOUT

01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:15.004 region:rollup2
BLIGHT.

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:16.972 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE INVESTMENTS COMING AND

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:18.174 region:rollup2
THESE WERE GENTRIFYING AREAS AND

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:19.875 region:rollup2
AS A LAW AND THERE'S A LOT OF OF

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:20.409 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY MOVING INTO THE AREA

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.744 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.345 region:rollup2
HOUSING GAP WAS GETTING WORSE

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.914 region:rollup2
AND WORSE AND SO THE IDEA OF AB

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:26.015 region:rollup2
FIFTY NINETY EIGHT WAS. WE

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.016 region:rollup2
HARDLY GOT THIS INVESTMENT

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:28.818 region:rollup2
COMING AND BOTH FOR THE

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:30.619 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ON AND ON THE

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:32.054 region:rollup2
JOB SITE. COULD WE CAPTURE A

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:34.090 region:rollup2
BILL THAT INCREMENT ONE ON THE

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:35.658 region:rollup2
PENINSULA UNLIKE OTHER PARTS THE

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.959 region:rollup2
STATE PERHAPS. HOW WE HAVE

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:38.360 region:rollup2
LISTENED TO PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:40.296 region:rollup2
WERE SEEN ASSESSED VALUES OF

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.364 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES TEN PERCENT YEAR OVER

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:44.166 region:rollup2
YEAR INCREASES IN ASSESSED VALUE

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:45.034 region:rollup2
AND PROPERTY TAX INCREASES FOR

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.668 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS?

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:47.136 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE FEELING PEER PRETTY

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:48.704 region:rollup2
POSITIVE OUT THAT THE ISSUE IS

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.672 region:rollup2
CAN WE CAPTURE SOME OF THAT FOR

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:51.574 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S WERE

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:52.842 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO DO. SOME OF THE

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:53.809 region:rollup2
OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE DID SEE

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.144 region:rollup2
WE ALSO DID WORKED ON.

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:57.213 region:rollup2
A BOOMERANG BILL.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:59.081 region:rollup2
WAS A MEMBER BONTA WERE SOME OF

01:16:57.213 --> 01:17:00.249 region:rollup2
THOSE REVENUES TO COME BACK.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.983 region:rollup2
FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.585 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT BACK TO

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:03.586 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS COULD YOU BOND

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:05.020 region:rollup2
AGAINST THOSE REVENUES.

01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:06.188 region:rollup2
SANTA SITTING KIND OF SAN

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.289 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO HAS DONE THAT MOTHER

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:09.124 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION OF ACTUALLY

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:11.127 region:rollup2
DEDICATED SOME OF THOSE. THOSE

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.461 region:rollup2
LAWS ARE REVENUES COMING BACK

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.762 region:rollup2
THE WILD WHY MANY JURISDICTIONS

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT DONE IT DOWN KIND OF

01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:16.132 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO THIS WITH THAT THEY

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:17.600 region:rollup2
DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PENSION

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.767 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS THERE'D THERE'D

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.402 region:rollup2
WRESTLING WITH AND ON GOING

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:21.904 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. THAT

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:23.439 region:rollup2
EXISTED PRIOR TO THEIR THEIR A

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:24.673 region:rollup2
DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:26.442 region:rollup2
BONDS IS THEY STILL NEED TO PAY

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:27.877 region:rollup2
OFF BUT WE THINK THAT OVER TIME.

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:29.578 region:rollup2
HAS ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:31.380 region:rollup2
PAID OFF AS WE ADDRESS THE

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.214 region:rollup2
PENSION OBLIGATIONS THERE WILL

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.782 region:rollup2
BE ADDITIONAL.

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:35.351 region:rollup2
REVENUES ARE POTENTIALLY IF WE

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.719 region:rollup2
HAVE THE BONDING AUTHORITY

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.987 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH YOU KNOW.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.955 region:rollup2
A ROOF GOAL OF OUR ECONOMY

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:41.423 region:rollup2
GOLDBERG KIND OF MECHANISM. AND

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.057 region:rollup2
JUST BE ABLE TO ISSUE DEBT

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.292 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT INCREASING

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:45.027 region:rollup2
TAXES BUT YOU'RE TAPPING INTO

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:45.861 region:rollup2
SOME THOSE RESOURCES ARE COMING.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.496 region:rollup2
UP FROM THE PARK PRIVATE

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:48.564 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT SO HAVING SAID ALL

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.266 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS I WOULD SAY WE DO

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:51.233 region:rollup2
NEED THE LEGISLATURE STEP IN A

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup2
HELP US WORK THROUGH THE

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:54.436 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. ONE THE

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.437 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BEEN INCREMENTAL IS

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.872 region:rollup2
ONE TO MAKE SURE HE GOT IT RIGHT

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:58.407 region:rollup2
WITH DAN WITH THE CITY'S FIRST

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.875 region:rollup2
AS WE BUILT ON THAT. AND IT HAD

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.076 region:rollup2
A TOOL THAT WE COULD THEN TRY TO

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.877 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THE COUNTIES ON. AT

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:03.445 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:04.346 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL AND NOW WE THINK WE'RE

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.447 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SOME SIGNIFICANT CLEAN

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.549 region:rollup2
UP THE SURE TO FIFTEEN NINETY

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.816 region:rollup2
EIGHT WITH WAS WITH SUMMER

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:08.751 region:rollup2
MULLIN AND WE HOPE THAT THE

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:11.153 region:rollup2
LEAGUE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WITH

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:11.687 region:rollup2
US. WE ALSO NEED TO GET SEE SACK

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.088 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WE GOT COUNTIES

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:14.590 region:rollup2
APPROACHING US SAYING THAT WE

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.157 region:rollup2
LIKE TO LOOK AT THESE TWO ALSO

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WILL BE

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:19.195 region:rollup2
BRINGING FORWARD. WILL BE INPUT

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.195 region:rollup2
FROM CITIES FROM FROM COUNTIES

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:20.996 region:rollup2
AND ALSO FROM BOND COUNSEL

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:22.231 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:23.132 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NEED TO WRITE THOSE

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:23.832 region:rollup2
OPINIONS TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.000 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:26.302 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.902 region:rollup2
GET THAT LANGUAGE RIGHT TO BE

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:28.571 region:rollup2
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AS WE THINK

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:31.907 region:rollup2
REALLY CLOSE AND NOW'S THE TIME

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:32.575 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TO TALK ABOUT AARTI

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.108 region:rollup2
AARTI TO POINT ON EVEN.

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:34.343 region:rollup2
PERHAPS HAVING THE STATE

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:35.911 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE FIRST ALL GIVEN THE

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:37.613 region:rollup2
SAME PAGE WE GOT ALL THESE TOOLS

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
AND I GOT THIS LANGUAGE NOW. IN

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:40.216 region:rollup2
IN THE CODE US MAKE SURE IT'S

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:41.750 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT AND LET'S MAKE SURE%

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.953 region:rollup2
TOLD A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.553 region:rollup2
THE FLEXIBILITY AND USER

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:46.922 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.723 region:rollup2
STAND THE SUB. IT IMMEDIATELY

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.390 region:rollup2
AND ACTION ARE BILL ANOTHER

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.425 region:rollup2
PIECE THE LANGUAGE WILL BE THAT

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.927 region:rollup2
YOU CONNECT THE BASED YOUR COULD

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:53.329 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:55.364 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR SHE COULD GO BACK. A

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:56.198 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM OF FIVE YEARS SO THAT

01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:57.866 region:rollup2
ALL THAT GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:59.335 region:rollup2
ATTACKS OCCUR WE TRY TO CAPTURE

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.902 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT NOW. AND BEGIN

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:01.170 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT THAT RIGHT AWAY

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.704 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TAKE LOANS FROM

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.639 region:rollup2
THE CITY THAT NEED TO BE.

SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.209 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS MCCARTY TWO POINT

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:23.418 region:rollup2
IT JUST MAKE DECISIONS BUT THEY

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:25.087 region:rollup2
COULD USE IT.

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:26.622 region:rollup2
UP THE CREEL LOG MAYBE NOT SO

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:28.423 region:rollup2
MUCH BECAUSE OF THE INCOME

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:30.926 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE THE CREEL

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:32.661 region:rollup2
LAW WAS TRYING TO AT LEAST GET

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:35.130 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE WHAT WAS THE COR

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:36.798 region:rollup2
IDEA OF REDEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.333 region:rollup2
YOU HAD A TRASHED AREA AND YOU

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:39.935 region:rollup2
WANTED TO FIX IT UP YOU KNOW AND

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:42.137 region:rollup2
AND AND TO THE EXTENT THE OLD

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:44.006 region:rollup2
ALREADY A WAS. WAS A CRITICIZED

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.173 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:46.742 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE CRITICIZED

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:48.477 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MAYBE THE AREA WASN'T.

01:25:46.742 --> 01:25:50.545 region:rollup2
WAS INVITED AND THAT NOT WAS

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:51.880 region:rollup2
PART OF THE ISSUE SO YOU HAVE IF

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:53.315 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO DO REGULAR

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.050 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ECONOMIC

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:56.785 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN GO TO ANY

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:58.654 region:rollup2
AYE FD GO FOR IT. IF YOU'RE

01:25:56.785 --> 01:26:01.156 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO URBAN DOWNTOWN

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.791 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT THEN SOMETHING

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.258 region:rollup2
LIKE A CAREER OR MAYBE A WERE

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:05.193 region:rollup2
WERE IMPROVED KOREA IS

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:06.695 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:07.796 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD USE.

01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:09.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THE.

01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:12.234 region:rollup2
THE OUSING AUTHORITY IDEA

01:26:09.798 --> 01:26:13.602 region:rollup2
AGAIN THERE IS NO NO INCOME

01:26:12.234 --> 01:26:16.438 region:rollup2
LIMITATION IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:18.407 region:rollup2
THE YEAH E. FID. AND YOU HAVE A

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:20.175 region:rollup2
LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHERE

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:22.677 region:rollup2
YOU CAN USE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:23.812 region:rollup2
TO GET SALES TAXES THOUGH YOU

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:26.448 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:27.682 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION IN ONE. BUT BUT YOU

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:29.217 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE IT ISN'T IT THERE

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:31.153 region:rollup2
ISN'T A RESTRICTION OF HOW MUCH

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:32.054 region:rollup2
SALES TAXES YOU DONATE SO I

01:26:31.153 --> 01:26:32.654 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT AFFORDABLE

01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:35.023 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:35.924 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IS GOING TO BE A VERY

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.092 region:rollup2
USEFUL TOOL.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:38.794 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD LOOK

01:26:37.092 --> 01:26:40.562 region:rollup2
AT AND.

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:42.197 region:rollup2
DAMN IT'S IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:43.432 region:rollup2
SINCE WE DID OUR CREE ANALYSIS

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:45.367 region:rollup2
BUT I BELIEVE WHEN WE DID OUR

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.501 region:rollup2
CREATE ANALYSIS.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:48.270 region:rollup2
WELL LIBERTY STATION WHICH

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:49.805 region:rollup2
HASN'T SEEN DIEGO IS A FORMER

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:52.607 region:rollup2
NAVY BASE

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:54.743 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:56.611 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THAT INTO THAT ANALYSIS

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:57.913 region:rollup2
AS AN ELIGIBLE CENSUS TRACT. BY

01:26:56.611 --> 01:27:00.015 region:rollup2
THE MERE FACT THAT IT WAS OF A

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:02.084 region:rollup2
CLOSED MILITARY FACILITATORS

01:27:00.015 --> 01:27:02.684 region:rollup2
FACILITIES SO I BELIEVE THERE IS

01:27:02.084 --> 01:27:03.985 region:rollup2
A.

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:05.554 region:rollup2
A CARVE OUT IN THE CREEL

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.788 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FORMER

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:08.490 region:rollup2

I'VE. I'VE LET OUR WORK LOOKING

AT THE FUTURE OF THE THREE

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:26.334 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWNS IN THE BAY AREA BUT

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.702 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN PART TODAY WHAT I'M

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:29.171 region:rollup2
HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS SOME

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:31.139 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS AND WORK WE DID OVER

01:28:29.171 --> 01:28:31.973 region:rollup2
THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. REALLY

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:34.109 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:35.977 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AMONG THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:37.279 region:rollup2
REVITALIZATION AROUND ON THE

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.980 region:rollup2
RAIL STATIONS BOTH THE HIGH

01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:40.248 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL I'M WILL BE MANAGING

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.483 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY BROADLY THINKING

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:43.084 region:rollup2
ABOUT RAIL IN THE OPPORTUNITY

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:44.419 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THERE ARE COPIES.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:46.588 region:rollup2
OF THIS REPORT.

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:48.089 region:rollup2
AROUND YOUR DESK AND AND I

01:28:46.588 --> 01:28:49.157 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW SOME VERY

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.458 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT RURAL

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.194 region:rollup2
AREAS THIS IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:53.895 region:rollup2
ABOUT A VARIETY OF PLACES AND SO

01:28:52.194 --> 01:28:55.497 region:rollup2
WHAT I HOPE I CAN SPEAK TO IS A

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:56.965 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF SOME DISTINCTIONS.

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:59.000 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE

01:28:56.965 --> 01:29:00.602 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING AT HERE FROM FROM

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.937 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR OR ADDITIONS.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:04.472 region:rollup2
FROM SOME OF THE PRIOR PIECE

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:06.641 region:rollup2
THEN REALLY ALSO I'M APPLYING

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:07.375 region:rollup2
THIS THINKING ABOUT

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.476 region:rollup2
REVITALIZATION.

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.511 region:rollup2
IN A LITTLE AHEAD OF A BROADER

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:11.112 region:rollup2
WAY ABOUT REALLY WHAT WE TRYING

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:12.581 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH FOR THE BIG GOALS

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.949 region:rollup2
OF OVER TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AS

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:16.218 region:rollup2
A STATE I'M AND IN PARTICULAR

01:29:13.949 --> 01:29:17.552 region:rollup2
PLACES. AND SO THE SO THE REPORT

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:18.420 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE DID WE WORK WITH

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.554 region:rollup2
THE WITH A HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:21.289 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IN THE STRATEGIC

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:23.258 region:rollup2
GROWTH COUNCIL AND A VARIETY OF

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:24.626 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE. I'M BUT IN PART

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:27.229 region:rollup2
THE THE QUESTION THAT WE WERE

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:28.563 region:rollup2
ASKING WAS WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.465 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:32.267 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FROM THIS MASSIVE

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
STATE INVESTMENT IT IS NOT JUST

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:35.503 region:rollup2
A TRANSPORTATION PROJECT. IT IS

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:37.205 region:rollup2
REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:39.207 region:rollup2
HOW THE STATE GROWS WHERE IT

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:40.375 region:rollup2
GROWS AND TO BRING ECONOMIC

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:42.043 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTS OF THE

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.511 region:rollup2
STATE SO IN PART VII THE

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:45.280 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON THE THINKING HERE

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:46.348 region:rollup2
WERE. THE INTERMEDIATE STATIONS

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.149 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE SAN

01:29:46.348 --> 01:29:49.684 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN VALLEY AMID TO A CERTAIN

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:51.419 region:rollup2
EXTENT GILROY IN AND AND SANTA

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:53.455 region:rollup2
CLARA COUNTY THE PLACES WHERE

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:54.222 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF RAIL INVESTMENT IS

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:55.357 region:rollup2
NOT AS OBVIOUS

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.858 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN IF YOU LOOK

01:29:55.357 --> 01:29:58.593 region:rollup2
AT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

01:29:56.858 --> 01:30:00.495 region:rollup2
RAIL INVESTMENT ACTUALLY THE

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:01.596 region:rollup2
BENEFITS CAN SOMETIMES A CREW

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.098 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT TO THATTODAY.

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:04.1000 region:rollup2
CENTRAL CITIES BUT WE WANTED TO

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:06.034 region:rollup2
SAY IN CALIFORNIA WHAT'S GONNA

01:30:04.1000 --> 01:30:07.269 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WEARING THE BENEFITS AND

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:09.104 region:rollup2
BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AMBER

01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:10.538 region:rollup2
SAID AND SO IN A LOT OF THAT THE

01:30:09.104 --> 01:30:11.940 region:rollup2
WORK WE DID HERE WE HAD WE

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:13.375 region:rollup2
CONVENED. A MEMBERS AND

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.777 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HIGH

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:16.711 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL STATION CITIES INTO A

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.679 region:rollup2
SERIES OF DIALOGUES

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.880 region:rollup2
THAT SAID I THINK A LOT OF THE

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:20.115 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I SHARE

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.450 region:rollup2
WITH YOU AT A HIGH LEVEL. ARE

01:30:20.115 --> 01:30:24.119 region:rollup2
VERY APPLICABLE TO SAN JOSE AND

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:25.453 region:rollup2
APPLICABLE TO OAKLAND APPLICABLE

01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:27.155 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TO SAN DIEGO AND LOS

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:28.290 region:rollup2
ANGELES ON AND OTHER PARTS OF

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.791 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:31.359 region:rollup2
CITY BEGIN A COUPLE OF MAYBE

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:33.094 region:rollup2
POINTS OF OF OF.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.930 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION BEYOND WHAT WE WE

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:37.065 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE BEFORE I'M

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:38.900 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM IS REALLY THE IDEA

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:40.502 region:rollup2
OF INSURING THAT THE STATE GETS

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.469 region:rollup2
A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT FOR A

01:30:40.502 --> 01:30:42.504 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE WORK THAT IT'S DOING

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:43.939 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE LEAGUE

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:45.106 region:rollup2
OF CITIES THE NOTION OF. IT

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:47.275 region:rollup2
BEING APPROPRIATE FOR THERE TO

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:48.710 region:rollup2
BE SOME LEVEL OF STATE OVERSIGHT

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:50.245 region:rollup2
TO MEET STATE GOALS BUT TO KIND

01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:51.112 region:rollup2
OF TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER WHEN

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.447 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS MAKING AN

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.149 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT HOW DOES THE STATE

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.550 region:rollup2
ALSO PARTICIPATE. I'M IN SOME OF

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:56.418 region:rollup2
THE UPSIDE.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.953 region:rollup2
A SECOND POINT IS REALLY

01:30:56.418 --> 01:30:59.054 region:rollup2
THINKING AROUND THE IDEA OF

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.922 region:rollup2
JOINT GOVERNANCE OF KIND OF

01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:03.224 region:rollup2
LOCALS AND THE STATE

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:05.093 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY WORKING TOGETHER TO

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:06.528 region:rollup2
IMAGINE THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:07.696 region:rollup2
PLACES SOMETHING WE DIDN'T DO IN

01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:09.497 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT REDEVELOPMENTS

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:10.498 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH. ON THE LOCAL PROGRAM

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:12.133 region:rollup2
THERE'S A QUITE A VARIETY OF

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.535 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.970 region:rollup2
I'M A THIRD POINT THIS WAS

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:16.538 region:rollup2
REFERENCE A LITTLE BIT FROM THE

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:17.972 region:rollup2
FROM THE OTHERS SPEAKERS WAS

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:19.607 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOOLS WE HAVE HAVE

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:21.343 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS BUT IN MANY WAYS ARE

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:23.111 region:rollup2
NOT MANDATORY SAYS WE THINK

01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:24.079 region:rollup2
ABOUT ADDITIONAL TOOLS. TO WHAT

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:25.814 region:rollup2
EXTENT DO WE WANT THE

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:28.350 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THEM.

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:30.352 region:rollup2
TO TO BE MANDATORY.

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:31.853 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WOULD ALSO KIND OF

01:31:30.352 --> 01:31:33.588 region:rollup2
ADD ADD TO THAT TWO ADDITIONAL

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:34.956 region:rollup2
POINTS ONE IS THAT WE'RE

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:36.825 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:39.194 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT COMMUNITY.

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:40.495 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT REVITALIZATION AS

01:31:39.194 --> 01:31:41.930 region:rollup2
BEING A LOT BROADER THAN

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:43.465 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOLS IN

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.833 region:rollup2
FACT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:31:43.465 --> 01:31:46.234 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:48.436 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THE STATE WATER SOME

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:49.437 region:rollup2
OF OUR LARGER POLICY GOALS. AND

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.538 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE SOME LARGER APPROACHES

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:52.741 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTIONS

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:54.509 region:rollup2
AROUND I'M REGIONAL LAND USE

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:56.244 region:rollup2
AND IN A SENSE CAPTURING GROWTH

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.812 region:rollup2
WITH IN URBAN AREAS WRIT LARGE

01:31:56.244 --> 01:32:00.215 region:rollup2
PRESERVING FARMLAND AND

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:01.783 region:rollup2
PROTECTING. I'M OPEN SPACES IS

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:03.318 region:rollup2
RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:04.953 region:rollup2
COURSE OF THE CITY'S

01:32:03.318 --> 01:32:06.588 region:rollup2
I'M WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA WHAT

01:32:04.953 --> 01:32:08.156 region:rollup2
KIND OF PLANNING CRITERIA SHOULD

01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:10.058 region:rollup2
WE BE APPLYING TO PARTICULAR

01:32:08.156 --> 01:32:12.694 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SHOULD THE STATE BE

01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:13.895 region:rollup2
SETTING THOSE CRITERIA. ARE I'M.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.296 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION KIND OF TWO LAST

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:16.865 region:rollup2
POINTS AROUND THE SORT OF AN

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:18.600 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PIECE IS.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.467 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTATION IS OFTEN

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.002 region:rollup2
FORGOTTEN WE HEARD ABOUT

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.871 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IS HUGE

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:25.073 region:rollup2
LOSS OF HUMAN CAPITAL WITH WITH

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:25.840 region:rollup2
THE END OF THOSE SYSTEMS WE ALSO

01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:28.443 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.577 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANS.

01:32:28.443 --> 01:32:30.612 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS IN CREATING SOME

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:32.147 region:rollup2
KIND OF IN.

01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:33.815 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OR SOME

01:32:32.147 --> 01:32:35.483 region:rollup2
SORT OF ENTITY THE AND THEY CAN

01:32:33.815 --> 01:32:37.352 region:rollup2
CARRY IT OUT AND I WOULD ALSO BE

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:38.420 region:rollup2
REMISS BY NOT BRINGING UP THE

01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:40.155 region:rollup2
ROLE OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.890 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION OF ALL THE VARIOUS

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:43.858 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS. IN TRANSPORTATION

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:45.427 region:rollup2
IN OUR DOWNTOWNS I MEAN OUR

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:46.761 region:rollup2
STATION AREAS AND SO THE

01:32:45.427 --> 01:32:47.362 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE I'M BRINGING A

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.430 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT AND HERE IS HOW DO

01:32:47.362 --> 01:32:49.764 region:rollup2
WE.

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.832 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THIS CONVERSATION

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:52.801 region:rollup2
REALLY WORKS.

01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:55.003 region:rollup2
FOR RAIL STATIONS REALLY WORKS

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:57.038 region:rollup2
FOR TRANSIT FACILITIES.

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:57.839 region:rollup2
SO LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.640 region:rollup2
KIND OF ABOUT THE RAIL

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:00.475 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.143 region:rollup2
AND AND KIND OF SOME VERY

01:33:00.475 --> 01:33:02.744 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC A TARGETED

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:04.746 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT TO DO

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:06.247 region:rollup2
SO.

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:07.649 region:rollup2
WE ARE WE ARE MAKING A MAJOR

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.983 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT RAILING CALIFORNIA

01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:10.518 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A PIECE ABOUT

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:12.220 region:rollup2
THE STATE RAIL PLAN IS ANOTHER

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:13.788 region:rollup2
ONE AND SO WE HAVE DOZENS OF

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.322 region:rollup2
PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:15.390 region:rollup2
GONNA BE CONNECTED TO EACH

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:17.092 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:17.959 region:rollup2
AS PART OF A NETWORK AND SO

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY HELP

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:21.396 region:rollup2
REALIZE THE STATE'S CLIMATE

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:23.765 region:rollup2
GOALS UNHOOK SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY

01:33:21.396 --> 01:33:25.100 region:rollup2
FROM FROM AUTOMOBILES AND IT'S

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:26.768 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE THINK A

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.436 region:rollup2
LOT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.971 region:rollup2
HOUSING AROUND THIS PLACES. IT

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.739 region:rollup2
IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:33.575 region:rollup2
ABOUT COMMERCIAL OF ELEMENT AND

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:35.210 region:rollup2
JOBS AND DESTINATIONS AROUND

01:33:33.575 --> 01:33:37.345 region:rollup2
RAIL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:39.013 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN I'M INTERNATIONALLY

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:40.148 region:rollup2
AND SEEN IN THE BAY AREA THAT.

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:41.950 region:rollup2
IF RICHEST IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT

01:33:40.148 --> 01:33:43.885 region:rollup2
OF THEIR CARS GETTING PEOPLE ON

01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:45.787 region:rollup2
TO TRANSIT ON TO RAIL WE GOT A

01:33:43.885 --> 01:33:47.055 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF JOBS AND DESTINATIONS

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:48.656 region:rollup2
AROUND THE RAIL STATIONS.

01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:50.425 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:51.759 region:rollup2
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TOOLS

01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:52.327 region:rollup2
AND IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:54.529 region:rollup2
TRANSIT ON THAT SIDE OF LAND

01:33:52.327 --> 01:33:56.431 region:rollup2
USE.

01:33:54.529 --> 01:33:57.732 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE

01:33:56.431 --> 01:33:59.234 region:rollup2
A PART OF THAT.

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:00.835 region:rollup2
AND THEN I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:02.070 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.004 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:04.672 region:rollup2
THE STATE GETS A RETURN ON ITS

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:05.540 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.341 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.675 region:rollup2
THESE CHALLENGES.

01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:09.043 region:rollup2
AND IN PARTICULAR THE THE THE

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:10.678 region:rollup2
AREA THAT I WANT TO BE OUT A

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:12.113 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT TOO IS THINKING ABOUT

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:14.382 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES OF OF PLACES

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:15.550 region:rollup2
WHERE THE MARKET. CONTEXT IS IS

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:17.252 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT CERTAINLY.

01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:18.887 region:rollup2
THE PARTS OF SAN DIEGO WE'RE

01:34:17.252 --> 01:34:20.488 region:rollup2
HEARING ABOUT THERE'S A NEED FOR

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:21.589 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO KIND OF GET

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:23.458 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE MARKET TO COME IN

01:34:21.589 --> 01:34:24.926 region:rollup2
LATER THAT'S ONE SET OF MARKET

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:26.461 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THERE'S ANOTHER SET

01:34:24.926 --> 01:34:27.962 region:rollup2
OF MARKET CHALLENGES WE TAKE A

01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:29.831 region:rollup2
PLACE LIKE A DOWNTOWN FRESNO.

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:31.132 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:32.433 region:rollup2
OF INVESTMENT THERE'S GOING TO

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:33.768 region:rollup2
BE PLANNED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:35.737 region:rollup2
STATION THERE'S AN EXISTING

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:37.372 region:rollup2
AMTRAK STATION A BUT UNDER

01:34:35.737 --> 01:34:39.207 region:rollup2
CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS? A AN

01:34:37.372 --> 01:34:40.108 region:rollup2
OFFICE BUILDING THAT SAY COULD

01:34:39.207 --> 01:34:40.441 region:rollup2
GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:42.343 region:rollup2
EIGHTY BUCKS.

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:43.945 region:rollup2
IN SCHOOL A KIND OF SQUARE FOOT

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.647 region:rollup2
OF HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS OUT OF

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:46.414 region:rollup2
A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS

01:34:45.647 --> 01:34:47.649 region:rollup2
SQUARE FOOT COST

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:49.651 region:rollup2
TO BUILD A NEW OFFICE BUILDING

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:50.485 region:rollup2
SOLELY ABOUT HALF. OF THE VALUE

01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:51.853 region:rollup2
OF THAT BUILDING CAN BE

01:34:50.485 --> 01:34:53.221 region:rollup2
GENERATED BY THE CURRENT MARKET

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:54.722 region:rollup2
RENT SO YOU HAVE A GAP.

01:34:53.221 --> 01:34:56.724 region:rollup2
I'M A MAJOR GAP AND THAT'S IN

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:57.859 region:rollup2
FACT WHY YOU DON'T SEE MARKET

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:59.694 region:rollup2
RATE DEVELOPMENT I'M IN THAT

01:34:57.859 --> 01:35:00.528 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:02.630 region:rollup2
EVEN A PLACE LIKE DOWNTOWN

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:04.666 region:rollup2
OAKLAND ON WHICH FOR FOR DECADES

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:06.467 region:rollup2
HAS HAD BART HAS STRUGGLED TO

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:07.702 region:rollup2
GET MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT OVER

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:09.837 region:rollup2
A HUGE AMOUNT OF THIS TIME

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:11.072 region:rollup2
PERIOD SO WE KNOW THAT. RAIL ON

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:12.840 region:rollup2
ITS OWN AND SOME OF THESE

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:14.609 region:rollup2
EXISTING TOOLS WE HAD ON ITS OWN

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.910 region:rollup2
WERE INSUFFICIENT SO WE HAVE TO

01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:18.012 region:rollup2
THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:19.113 region:rollup2
ARM AND IT TO ENSURE THAT THAT

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.381 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE.

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:22.016 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE'VE ALSO

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.751 region:rollup2
SEEN IS THAT SOME TO THAT THERE

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:25.453 region:rollup2
ARE TIMES THAT THE VISION THAT A

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:26.788 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS FOR WHAT

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:28.489 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAPPEN IN THEIR RAIL

01:35:26.788 --> 01:35:30.258 region:rollup2
STATION OR IN THEIR DOWNTOWN.

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:32.226 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT REINFORCE OVERALL

01:35:30.258 --> 01:35:34.329 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE GOALS AND THERE MIGHT

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:36.064 region:rollup2
BE THE DESIRE FOR I'M ONE STORY

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:37.665 region:rollup2
TOWN HOMES AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:39.200 region:rollup2
ARE. ACROSS THE STREET FROM A

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.301 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION ORB

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.103 region:rollup2
SURFACE PARKING LOTS ARE

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:43.738 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PARKING OR

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.305 region:rollup2
OTHER KIND OF VISIONS THAT THAT

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:45.073 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.474 region:rollup2
DAY.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.009 region:rollup2
ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THE BEST

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:50.011 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF THE STATE IF WE LOOK

01:35:48.009 --> 01:35:50.845 region:rollup2
FORWARD SEVERAL DECADES

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:51.846 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:53.748 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SORT OF

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:55.049 region:rollup2
RISING TO THE CHALLENGE. OF THE

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:57.018 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AND THAT THE STATE

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:59.287 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ENSURE THAT IT GETS A

01:35:57.018 --> 01:36:00.221 region:rollup2
RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT ON THAT

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:01.356 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S PUTTING INTO THESE

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:03.091 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS.

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:04.459 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE WE WE ALSO KNOW

01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:05.493 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOOLS THEMSELVES AS

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:06.794 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.529 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON THINKING ABOUT ARE

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:10.131 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT TO THE TASK AND I

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.732 region:rollup2
THINK TO CUT TO THE CHASE ON

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.100 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT

01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:13.968 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY. WHEN YOU TAKE THE

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.303 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE THE VOLUNTARY

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.638 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION YOU KNOW THE CITY

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:18.006 region:rollup2
COULD DO IT BUT THEN THE COUNTY

01:36:16.638 --> 01:36:19.307 region:rollup2
MAY NOT PARTICIPATE.

01:36:18.006 --> 01:36:21.009 region:rollup2
.

01:36:19.307 --> 01:36:22.343 region:rollup2
AND AND AND I WOULD ARGUE ONE

01:36:21.009 --> 01:36:23.745 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT THAT A LOT

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:25.280 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:36:23.745 --> 01:36:26.681 region:rollup2
SIMPLY THE LOCAL PORTION.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.016 region:rollup2
OR THE VARIOUS PARTS A LOCAL

01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:29.784 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:31.819 region:rollup2
STATE COULD BE A PARTICIPANT I

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:32.954 region:rollup2
THINK THE NIFTY I'M CONCEPT FROM

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:34.756 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR IS A VERSION OF THE

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.823 region:rollup2
LOCAL PORTION OF THE SALES TAX

01:36:34.756 --> 01:36:37.058 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE IT A

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:38.893 region:rollup2
STEP FURTHER AND IMAGINE SOME

01:36:37.058 --> 01:36:40.762 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE INVESTMENTS.

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:42.063 region:rollup2
SO LET ME CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF

01:36:40.762 --> 01:36:44.098 region:rollup2
KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:45.600 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WE SEE ARE COMING OUT

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:47.235 region:rollup2
HERE IN THIS I WOULD SAY THESE

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.970 region:rollup2
REALLY BUILD FROM WHAT WE WHAT

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:50.505 region:rollup2
WE LEARN FROM FROM REDEVELOPMENT

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:52.240 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:53.808 region:rollup2
IT. ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.343 region:rollup2
FIRST POINT AND AND ALL I WANNA

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:56.711 region:rollup2
GET TO THE TOOL SPECIFICALLY BUT

01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:58.413 region:rollup2
I WANNA MAKE KIND OF THIS OF THE

01:36:56.711 --> 01:37:00.014 region:rollup2
BROADER PIECES IS THAT THE LOCAL

01:36:58.413 --> 01:37:01.516 region:rollup2
PLANS FOR THESE DISTRICTS FOR

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.650 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS WHAT HOWEVER THERE

01:37:01.516 --> 01:37:04.218 region:rollup2
TO FIND I'M I'M PARTICULARLY

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.987 region:rollup2
FOCUSED YOU'RE ON SORT OF RAIL

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:07.855 region:rollup2
STATION AREAS. BUT WE CAN HAVE

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:09.090 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS OF ANY KIND THROUGHOUT

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:10.825 region:rollup2
THE STATE. THEY OUGHT TO BE

01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:12.260 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED IN LINE WITH SOME KIND

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:13.361 region:rollup2
OF STATE OVERSIGHT GOALS OR IS

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.929 region:rollup2
IT SOME SORT OF VISION OF WHAT

01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:15.897 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO WHETHER

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:17.231 region:rollup2
THAT'S REDUCING OUR IMPACT ON

01:37:15.897 --> 01:37:18.1000 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE OR PRESERVING

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:19.967 region:rollup2
FARMLAND. ENSURING TRANSIT

01:37:18.1000 --> 01:37:21.969 region:rollup2
RIDERSHIP THESE ARE IMPORTANT

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:23.304 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE GOALS SO WHAT'S BEING

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:24.572 region:rollup2
PRODUCED LOCALLY SHOULD SHOULD

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.873 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THAT.

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:27.342 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS THAT WE NEED SOME

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.276 region:rollup2
KIND OF A DELIVERY ENTITY

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:30.545 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A DEVELOPMENT

01:37:28.276 --> 01:37:32.046 region:rollup2
CORPORATION THAT YES MIGHT HAVE

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:33.381 region:rollup2
THESE POWERS OF EMINENT DOMAIN

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:34.949 region:rollup2
BUT IT MIGHT ALSO HAVE BONDING

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:36.851 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY MIGHT ALSO BE HAVE THE

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:38.653 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE. OF PEOPLE WHO CAN

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:40.455 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKE A DEAL HAPPEN I'M

01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:41.522 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE WHATEVER

01:37:40.455 --> 01:37:43.191 region:rollup2
TOOLS WE WANT BUT YOU NEED YOU

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.625 region:rollup2
NEED YOU KNOW THE EXPERTISE BUT

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.294 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT KIND OF. POWERFUL

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:47.628 region:rollup2
ENTITY THAT CAN REALLY AREN'T

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:48.563 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THEN OF

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:50.832 region:rollup2
COURSE WE NEED TO REALLY THINK

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:51.099 region:rollup2
ABOUT ABOUT MODIFICATIONS TO THE

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:52.734 region:rollup2
TOOLS SO.

01:37:51.099 --> 01:37:54.068 region:rollup2
.

01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:55.903 region:rollup2
FIVE VERY BRIEF MODIFICATIONS

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:57.271 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:58.439 region:rollup2
THE SHARING IS NOT VOLUNTARY

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.340 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:01.909 region:rollup2
MANDATORY.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:03.277 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION SOAP CITIES AND

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:05.279 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TOGETHER ARE BOTH

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:06.881 region:rollup2
PUTTING IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:09.617 region:rollup2
INCREMENT IS AN EXAMPLE.

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:12.086 region:rollup2
AND IF THEIR THEIR DISTRICT.

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:13.387 region:rollup2
SECOND KIND OF UP MODIFICATION.

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:15.022 region:rollup2
AND AND WHEN I SAY MODIFICATION

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:16.524 region:rollup2
THESE COULD BE LEGISLATIVE

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:18.292 region:rollup2
MODIFICATIONS TO THE E. AYE

01:38:16.524 --> 01:38:20.695 region:rollup2
FDA'S COULD BE A NEW PIECE OF

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:21.295 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:38:20.695 --> 01:38:21.963 region:rollup2
THE REDEVELOPMENT LAW IS STILL

01:38:21.295 --> 01:38:23.264 region:rollup2
ON THE BOOKS.

01:38:21.963 --> 01:38:25.133 region:rollup2
SOME THAT STUFF COULD COME BACK

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:27.201 region:rollup2
BUT JUST IN TERMS OF PARTICULAR

01:38:25.133 --> 01:38:29.003 region:rollup2
CHANGES I'M POINT TO. THAT THERE

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:30.705 region:rollup2
IS BOTH STATE AND LOCAL

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:31.939 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION THAT IF THE LOCALS

01:38:30.705 --> 01:38:33.908 region:rollup2
ARE PUTTING UP THE INCREMENTAL

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:35.143 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX. MAYBE THE STATE'S

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.210 region:rollup2
ALSO PUTTING UP ITS INCREMENT IN

01:38:35.143 --> 01:38:37.545 region:rollup2
THE SALES TAX

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:38.546 region:rollup2
NOT THE LOCAL PORTION BUT THAT

01:38:37.545 --> 01:38:39.814 region:rollup2
BUT THE PORTION GOES TO THE

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:41.349 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND.

01:38:39.814 --> 01:38:42.583 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THEN THE LOCALS ARE

01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:43.985 region:rollup2
ALSO PUTTING UP THE GROWTH IN

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.286 region:rollup2
THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:47.255 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT YOU KNOW THE HOTEL TAX

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:49.023 region:rollup2
OR OTHER TOOLS SO WE CREATE A

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.158 region:rollup2
VEHICLE. OR MULTIPLE REVENUE

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:51.926 region:rollup2
STREAMS CAN COME IN AND IT GETS

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:53.561 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:54.629 region:rollup2
POINT THREE THAT THE STATE IS

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:56.097 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:58.1000 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

01:38:56.097 --> 01:39:00.435 region:rollup2
NOT JUST SETTING SOME CRITERIA

01:38:58.1000 --> 01:39:02.303 region:rollup2
BY WHICH A LOCAL DISTRICT PLAN

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:03.638 region:rollup2
PASSED TO IT HERE BUT MAYBE

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:05.206 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SEAT ON THE LOCAL

01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:06.174 region:rollup2
BOARD FOR.

01:39:05.206 --> 01:39:08.009 region:rollup2
SOME MEMBER OF THE STATE FROM

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:10.311 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL OP

01:39:08.009 --> 01:39:12.647 region:rollup2
ARE AND THEIR THERE'S A SHARED

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:14.615 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE IDEA LOCAL COUNTY

01:39:12.647 --> 01:39:16.150 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE MPO MAYBE THE TRANSIT

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:17.752 region:rollup2
OPERATORS APPROPRIATE. THAT

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:19.153 region:rollup2
THERE'S SHARED GOVERNANCE AND

01:39:17.752 --> 01:39:20.288 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE PIECES.

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:22.323 region:rollup2
AND THEN POINTS FOR AND FIVE A

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:24.225 region:rollup2
MUCH SMALLER ONE IS THAT IN SOME

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:25.726 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE REALLY

01:39:24.225 --> 01:39:27.361 region:rollup2
NEED SOME EARLY STAGE FINANCING

01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:28.296 region:rollup2
TO GET PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.764 region:rollup2
TO KICKSTART TAX INCREMENT

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:31.899 region:rollup2
FINANCING.

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:33.100 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT THE PLACES THAT ARE

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:34.302 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE GENERATING AS MUCH

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.970 region:rollup2
LOCALLY WE NEED WE NEED TO KIND

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:37.138 region:rollup2
OF JUMP START THEM AND MAYBE

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.773 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE STATE REVENUES ARE

01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:39.674 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:39:38.773 --> 01:39:41.709 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND THEN FINALLY A

01:39:39.674 --> 01:39:42.677 region:rollup2
SMALLER ONE THIS EXISTS IN SOME

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.045 region:rollup2
OF THE BILLS BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:39:42.677 --> 01:39:45.213 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE THE BONDS THAT CAN

01:39:44.045 --> 01:39:46.948 region:rollup2
BE APPROVED WITH WITHOUT A

01:39:45.213 --> 01:39:48.015 region:rollup2
PUBLIC VOTE. I'M KIND OF MAKE

01:39:46.948 --> 01:39:49.317 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THIS PROCESS GOES

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:51.652 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:53.321 region:rollup2
BUT SO LONG AS WHAT'S BEING

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.789 region:rollup2
PLANTED ENVISIONED IS MATCHING

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:56.224 region:rollup2
UP WITH.

01:39:54.789 --> 01:39:58.292 region:rollup2
THOSE STATEWIDE GOALS FROM THE

01:39:56.224 --> 01:39:59.927 region:rollup2
OUTSET AND IS A HEARING WITH THE

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:01.462 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT WAS REALLY DEVELOPED

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:02.296 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOT A BROAD VISION OF

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:03.698 region:rollup2
OF WHAT TO HAPPEN IN THOSE

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:05.900 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:07.702 region:rollup2
SO IN CONCLUSION WHAT WHAT WE'RE

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.371 region:rollup2
ARGUING WHAT WE SEEING IS IT

01:40:07.702 --> 01:40:11.606 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A SET OF IDEAS THAT WE

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.607 region:rollup2
SAW AS WE WERE THINKING ABOUT

01:40:11.606 --> 01:40:14.408 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION FROM THE

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:15.943 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT OF WHAT SHOULD WE DO

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:18.079 region:rollup2
ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL STATIONS.

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:19.380 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN BROADEN FROM THAT AND

01:40:18.079 --> 01:40:21.816 region:rollup2
EXTRAPOLATE FROM THAT THAT THIS

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.617 region:rollup2
IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AS WELL

01:40:21.816 --> 01:40:24.051 region:rollup2
FOR MANY RAIL STATIONS IN

01:40:22.617 --> 01:40:26.320 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:28.055 region:rollup2
AND INDEED SOME OF THESE IDEAS

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.290 region:rollup2
GENERALLY APPLIED.

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:30.825 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO BE TARGETED AND

01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:32.126 region:rollup2
KIND OF TWEAK TO DIFFERENT KINDS

01:40:30.825 --> 01:40:34.428 region:rollup2
OF CONTACTS BUT SOME OF THE

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:36.831 region:rollup2
POLICY PRINCIPLES OF STATE AND

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:38.065 region:rollup2
LOCAL SHARING AND PARTICIPATION

01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:39.600 region:rollup2
IN MEETING THESE SORT OF GOALS I

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:41.535 region:rollup2
THINK APPLIED. DIFFERENTLY TO

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.404 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AMONG OTHER PARTS

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:45.940 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO HABITAT QUESTIONS

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:47.241 region:rollup2
OR COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:51.579 region:rollup2
BUT A QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES.

IMAGINING HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:41.188 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE IDEAS TO REALLY

01:42:39.954 --> 01:42:43.224 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT OUT

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:44.325 region:rollup2

RAIL LINE.

01:43:40.748 --> 01:43:45.052 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE DID ON ALL THE

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:47.321 region:rollup2
STATIONS WAS A SIMILAR PLANNING

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:49.457 region:rollup2
CONCEPT YOU KNOW. REALLY WORKING

.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:04.338 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE PLANNING WE WORKED

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:06.373 region:rollup2
WITH EACH CITY INDIVIDUALLY AND

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:07.875 region:rollup2
WE WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW DO A

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:09.343 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE GOALS AS FAR AS THE

01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:12.246 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:13.514 region:rollup2
BUT THE DISTRICT ITSELF.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.316 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED WHAT IT DID ON THE

01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:16.817 region:rollup2
LAND THAT OWNED IT HAD ACTUALLY

01:44:15.316 --> 01:44:18.252 region:rollup2

IN KNOW FOR PEOPLE GETTING THE

01:44:28.062 --> 01:44:33.200 region:rollup2
WORK STUDENTS WE EVEN A. CREATED

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:33.467 region:rollup2
A SEPARATE. BYPASS OF THE LINE

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
TO GO TO.

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:36.470 region:rollup2
.

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:37.238 region:rollup2
CAL STATE SAN MARCUS.

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:39.840 region:rollup2
WHICH THE STUDENTS USE.

01:44:37.238 --> 01:44:41.675 region:rollup2
.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.310 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST WONDERING I GUESS

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:45.079 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS ONE YOU KNOW.

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:46.947 region:rollup2
I HEADS OF JUGGLE BETWEEN BEING

01:44:45.079 --> 01:44:49.350 region:rollup2
A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND WORK

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:50.551 region:rollup2
ON THE TRANSIT BOARD. WAS THE

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:52.386 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:54.622 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:56.490 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF THE STATE.

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:57.858 region:rollup2
HAS OVERSIGHT JUST LIKE WE AT

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:59.994 region:rollup2
THE TRANSIT DISTRICT HAD

01:44:57.858 --> 01:45:02.196 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT WE OWNED

01:44:59.994 --> 01:45:04.565 region:rollup2
BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. DICTATE

01:45:02.196 --> 01:45:05.933 region:rollup2
TO THE CITIES YOU KNOW WHAT THEY

01:45:04.565 --> 01:45:07.968 region:rollup2
COULD DO WE COULD WORK WITH THEM

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:10.704 region:rollup2
AND I'M WONDERING. YOU KNOW

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:13.407 region:rollup2
WITHOUT BYPASS AND LOCAL CONTROL

01:45:10.704 --> 01:45:15.142 region:rollup2
WHICH CITIES WANNA KEEP HOW CAN.

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.911 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE CONCEPTS THE STATE

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:19.180 region:rollup2
OPERATE LIKE A CARROT ON THE

01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:21.382 region:rollup2
STICK KIND OF OMAR AND INCENTIVE

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:22.650 region:rollup2
TO BRING THE CITY'S.

01:45:21.382 --> 01:45:24.652 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S SHOULD BE AN

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:26.220 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE FOR THEM. I MEAN THEY

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:27.555 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THE GOALS OF THE OF THE

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.589 region:rollup2
TAX INCREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE

01:45:27.555 --> 01:45:30.791 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:32.359 region:rollup2
AND THEY UNFORTUNATE THING WAS

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:34.328 region:rollup2
THE AREA WHERE ARE TRANSIT

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:36.130 region:rollup2
STATION IS WAS IN THE CENTER OF

01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:38.332 region:rollup2
OUR REDEVELOPMENT AREA WHICH WAS

01:45:36.130 --> 01:45:40.668 region:rollup2
JUST. YOU KNOW BEGGING TO BE

01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:43.537 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEVELOPED SO WHEN WE LOST

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:44.104 region:rollup2
THAT IT REALLY KILLED US SO I

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:44.972 region:rollup2
JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:47.174 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA.

01:45:44.972 --> 01:45:48.175 region:rollup2
OVERRIDING LOCAL CONTROL ALSO I

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:48.842 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING A

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:51.078 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD POINT BUT IT BUT ON

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:52.213 region:rollup2
A IF WHAT I HEAR FROM YOUR

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:53.547 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IS SOMETHING WE SEE

01:45:52.213 --> 01:45:55.349 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:57.017 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE OF FRAGMENTED DECISION

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:58.586 region:rollup2
MAKING THAT LOCAL CONTROL OFTEN

01:45:57.017 --> 01:46:00.254 region:rollup2
REFERS SIMPLY TO THE KIND OF

01:45:58.586 --> 01:46:02.122 region:rollup2
LAND USE DECISIONS AT THE LOCAL

01:46:00.254 --> 01:46:03.858 region:rollup2
CITY OR COUNTY HAS. BUT THEY'RE

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:06.060 region:rollup2
ALSO A SERIES OF OTHER DECISIONS

01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:08.329 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHERE'S THE TRANSIT SYSTEM

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:09.396 region:rollup2
GONNA PUT ITS TRAIN AND WHO HAS

01:46:08.329 --> 01:46:10.998 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY ON THE TRACKS AND

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:12.1000 region:rollup2
THERE'S SEVENTY FIVE OTHER

01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:13.500 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ARE OFTEN MADE BY OF

01:46:12.1000 --> 01:46:15.636 region:rollup2
KIND OF IN A FRAGMENTED

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.804 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. AND WHAT I

01:46:15.636 --> 01:46:19.273 region:rollup2
THINK PART OF WHAT WHAT WE'VE

01:46:16.804 --> 01:46:20.908 region:rollup2
LEARNED AND WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT

01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:22.209 region:rollup2
UP A GROUP OF LEADERS FROM SAN

01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:24.478 region:rollup2
JOSE LAST SUMMER TO LOOK AT RAIL

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:26.347 region:rollup2
STATIONS IN. AND FRANCE AND AND

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:27.348 region:rollup2
THE NETHERLANDS TO UNDERSTAND

01:46:26.347 --> 01:46:28.716 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION YOU'RE

01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:30.017 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT AND WE HEARD A VERY

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:31.252 region:rollup2
GOOD POINT FROM ONE OF THE

01:46:30.017 --> 01:46:31.819 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DONE STATION ABOUT

01:46:31.252 --> 01:46:32.720 region:rollup2
MEN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHICH

01:46:31.819 --> 01:46:34.521 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.791 region:rollup2
ALL THESE ENTITIES INVOLVED THE

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:38.425 region:rollup2
RAIL SYSTEM TO LOCAL CITIES THE

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:38.726 region:rollup2
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THE REGIONAL

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.494 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:42.062 region:rollup2
THEY ALL PARTICIPATED TOGETHER

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:44.932 region:rollup2
IN FORMING A JOINT GOVERNING

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:46.700 region:rollup2
BOARD TO DEVELOP THE STATIONS.

01:46:44.932 --> 01:46:48.569 region:rollup2
THEY ALL GOT

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.437 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THEY WANTED.

01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:52.072 region:rollup2
BUT MORE THAN THEY EXPECTED.

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:53.040 region:rollup2
SO BY JOINTLY GOING IN AND

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:54.408 region:rollup2
SAYING WE ARE GONNA MAKE

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.877 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BIG HAPPEN IN THIS

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:57.945 region:rollup2
PLACE YET MAYBE GOT TO GIVE UP A

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:59.246 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT IF WE WORKED

01:46:57.945 --> 01:47:01.315 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENTLY.

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:01.849 region:rollup2
BUT WE ACHIEVE SOMETHING MUCH

01:47:01.315 --> 01:47:03.918 region:rollup2
BIGGER BY COMING TOGETHER

01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:05.386 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:47:03.918 --> 01:47:06.287 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE BROADER

01:47:05.386 --> 01:47:08.289 region:rollup2
THAN THE REVITALIZATION

01:47:06.287 --> 01:47:09.857 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THIS AFTERNOON BUT

01:47:08.289 --> 01:47:11.759 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:12.559 region:rollup2
SHARED GOVERNANCE AROUND

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:14.662 region:rollup2
STATIONS WHERE YOU'VE GOT UP A

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:15.629 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF PEOPLE. PUTTING MONEY

01:47:14.662 --> 01:47:17.097 region:rollup2
AND THAT MIGHT LEAD TO WEAR HIM

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.965 region:rollup2
OF THE TRACKS HOW DO YOU GET THE

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:20.434 region:rollup2
TRAINS TO CONNECT WITH EACH

01:47:17.965 --> 01:47:21.936 region:rollup2
OTHER WHO BUILDS RUNS A STATION.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:23.570 region:rollup2
WHO BUILDS THE BUILDINGS ON IT

01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:24.838 region:rollup2
WHAT REVITALIZATION TOOLS HELP

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:26.206 region:rollup2
THE NEW HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:28.142 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING ALL OF

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:29.877 region:rollup2
THOSE PIECES TOGETHER SO I THINK

01:47:28.142 --> 01:47:31.278 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE DONE? ABSOLUTELY

01:47:29.877 --> 01:47:32.646 region:rollup2
WITHOUT UNDERMINING LOCAL

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:34.281 region:rollup2
CONTROL BUT ACTUALLY HELPING

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:36.116 region:rollup2
REALIZE THE VISION THAT THE

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:38.485 region:rollup2
LOCAL CITIES HAVE BY GIVING THEM

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:39.553 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND OTHER

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:41.488 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THEY'RE WORKING IN

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:42.990 region:rollup2
A MORE COORDINATED WAY. WITH

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:45.125 region:rollup2
TRANSIT WITH THE STATE WITH

01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:46.493 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER ENTITIES.

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:48.262 region:rollup2
BOB WOODWORKING NO IN LA

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:50.331 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T WORK IN ESCONDIDO OR

01:47:48.262 --> 01:47:53.467 region:rollup2
WINTERS ARE YOU KNOW RIGHT SO

01:47:50.331 --> 01:47:55.569 region:rollup2
AND NEEDS COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:57.004 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ULTIMATE VISION.

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:58.572 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO I IT'S KIND OF LIKE A

01:47:57.004 --> 01:48:00.207 region:rollup2
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES TYPE OF

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:02.142 region:rollup2
THING.

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:03.677 region:rollup2
THAT CAN DO FINANCING YEAH I CAN

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:04.778 region:rollup2
DO FINANCING BUT I ALSO THINK

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:06.447 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S THE

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:07.948 region:rollup2
COORDINATION OF. WHERE'S THAT

01:48:06.447 --> 01:48:08.816 region:rollup2
BUS STOP IS THE BUS STOP GOING

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:10.351 region:rollup2
TO BE ON WHAT SIDE OF THE

01:48:08.816 --> 01:48:11.952 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST

01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:13.420 region:rollup2
THE FINANCING IT'S ALSO SOME OF

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:14.755 region:rollup2
THE. THE TRANSPORTATION

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.557 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN THE LOCATION OF

01:48:14.755 --> 01:48:19.326 region:rollup2
PARKING AND I THINK TO MAKE

01:48:16.557 --> 01:48:20.928 region:rollup2
THESE DISTRICTS WORK HAVING. ALL

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.696 region:rollup2
THOSE ENTITIES AT THE TABLE IN A

01:48:20.928 --> 01:48:25.466 region:rollup2
COORDINATED WAY CAN HELP MAKE

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:26.734 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPEN.

01:48:25.466 --> 01:48:28.569 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:48:26.734 --> 01:48:31.972 region:rollup2
YOUR PRESENTATION MOVE ON TO.

01:48:28.569 --> 01:48:33.240 region:rollup2
FISH KELLY SHE IS THE MANAGING.

01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:33.807 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR AT VALLEY VISION

CHILDREN. I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE

01:48:38.178 --> 01:48:40.948 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY VALLEY VISION IS OF

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:42.583 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CIVIC LEADERSHIP

01:48:40.948 --> 01:48:45.285 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION WERE BASED HERE IN

01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:47.454 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AND IN. STOCKTON AND

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:48.522 region:rollup2
WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH MANY

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:50.557 region:rollup2
PARTNERS ACROSS

01:48:48.522 --> 01:48:52.159 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE PART OF

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:54.161 region:rollup2
A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF REGIONAL

01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:56.030 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIONS CALLED.

01:48:54.161 --> 01:48:57.498 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STORAGE OF NETWORK.

01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:59.066 region:rollup2
SO MY OWN BACKGROUND IS THAT

01:48:57.498 --> 01:49:00.934 region:rollup2
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:48:59.066 --> 01:49:02.836 region:rollup2
CONSULTING AS AN ECONOMIC

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:04.271 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONER WITH

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:05.039 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES I'VE DONE A

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:06.206 region:rollup2
LOT OF RURAL ECONOMIC

01:49:05.039 --> 01:49:08.475 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES I

01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:10.511 region:rollup2
PREPARED GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:11.945 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SO. I'VE

01:49:10.511 --> 01:49:13.480 region:rollup2
SEEN FIRST HAND THAT THAT

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:15.482 region:rollup2
CAPACITY ISSUE A LOT OF TIMES

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.316 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS ARE HIRED ESPECIALLY

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:18.185 region:rollup2
IN RURAL AREAS BECAUSE THEY DO

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:21.188 region:rollup2
NOT. HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:22.990 region:rollup2
PREPARE. AND COMPETE FOR FUNDING

01:49:21.188 --> 01:49:24.491 region:rollup2
FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE.

01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:25.793 region:rollup2
TELEVISION ALSO MANAGES THE

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:27.361 region:rollup2
REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSORTIUM

01:49:25.793 --> 01:49:28.929 region:rollup2
WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC

01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:30.864 region:rollup2
UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THAT

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:32.633 region:rollup2
IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE OUT FUNDING

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:34.601 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTEEN CONSORTIUM ACROSS

01:49:32.633 --> 01:49:36.136 region:rollup2
THE STATE. SIMILAR TO OURS TO

01:49:34.601 --> 01:49:38.872 region:rollup2
TRY TO ADDRESS OUR BROADBAND

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:41.008 region:rollup2
GAPS AND SO. WE HAVE LOOKED AT

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:43.243 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE YAHYA YAHYA PHDS.

01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:45.546 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:46.180 region:rollup2
UPTAKE FOR SOME OF THE REASONS

01:49:45.546 --> 01:49:46.346 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD IN WHICH WE'D LIKE

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:47.981 region:rollup2
TO.

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:49.650 region:rollup2
DISCUSS TODAY.

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:50.551 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE A FEDERAL GRANT TO

01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:52.086 region:rollup2
PROMOTE FOOD BEVERAGE

01:49:50.551 --> 01:49:54.755 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING IN THE CENTRAL

01:49:52.086 --> 01:49:56.290 region:rollup2
VALLEY WITH OTHER PARTNERS AND

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:58.826 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:49:56.290 --> 01:50:00.327 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND CHALLENGES AND SO

01:49:58.826 --> 01:50:01.662 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE FACE A LOT OF THESE

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:03.630 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND WIDE THESE TOOLS

01:50:01.662 --> 01:50:04.665 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. TO BE UP TO

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.866 region:rollup2
SPEED YET.

01:50:04.665 --> 01:50:07.468 region:rollup2
SO ONE THING I'D LIKE TO

01:50:05.866 --> 01:50:08.936 region:rollup2
REFERENCE IS THE CALIFORNIA

01:50:07.468 --> 01:50:10.637 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION FOR LOCAL ECONOMIC

01:50:08.936 --> 01:50:12.439 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PREPARED A PRIMER ON

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:14.341 region:rollup2
THESE NEW FINANCING TOOLS WHICH

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:16.343 region:rollup2
I THINK IS VERY VALUABLE. WILL

01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:17.978 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT AND SOME OF MY

01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:20.147 region:rollup2
REMARKS TODAY ARE FROM.

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:21.682 region:rollup2
FROM THIS PRIMER AND THEY DID A

01:50:20.147 --> 01:50:24.251 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD FACT SHEET AS WELL.

01:50:21.682 --> 01:50:25.886 region:rollup2
SO. THEIR BIGGEST OUR FOCUS IS

01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:27.187 region:rollup2
THAT THESE TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE

01:50:25.886 --> 01:50:28.589 region:rollup2
VERY USEFUL AND WE NEED TO PUT

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:29.857 region:rollup2
THEM IN PLACE NOW TO PREPARE FOR

01:50:28.589 --> 01:50:31.692 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE BUT THERE ARE A LOT

01:50:29.857 --> 01:50:33.160 region:rollup2
OF CHALLENGES. FOR BOTH THE

01:50:31.692 --> 01:50:35.128 region:rollup2
PLANNING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.363 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED AND SO ONE OF

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:38.298 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES ARE ARE THAT

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:40.167 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE TO SET UP SO

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:42.669 region:rollup2
INCLUDE STAFF TIME CONSULTANTS

01:50:40.167 --> 01:50:43.904 region:rollup2
SPECIAL COUNSEL. AND YOU NEED TO

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:45.672 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE TIME IN THE COSTS

01:50:43.904 --> 01:50:47.474 region:rollup2
FOR THINGS LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:49.376 region:rollup2
REVENUE ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:50.611 region:rollup2
FISCAL FEASIBILITY. UNIT OUT%

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:52.913 region:rollup2
REACHING NEGOTIATIONS WITH

01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:55.015 region:rollup2
FINANCING AUTHORITIES FORMATION

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:57.551 region:rollup2
OF A PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCY OR

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:59.520 region:rollup2
JPA IF NECESSARY YOU HAVE TO

01:50:57.551 --> 01:51:01.054 region:rollup2
DRAFT A PLAN FOR ADOPTION. AND

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.422 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THESE ARE SUBSTANTIVE

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:04.258 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:07.361 region:rollup2
SEEK WORK AND THEN IN THE CASE

01:51:04.258 --> 01:51:07.661 region:rollup2
OF A SEE OUR. OUR AYE A YOU MAY

01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:09.496 region:rollup2
NEED A BOAT

01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:11.298 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF MECHANICS

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:14.067 region:rollup2
TO PUTTING THESE TOOLS TOGETHER

01:51:11.298 --> 01:51:15.369 region:rollup2
THAT DO HAVE A COST IMPLICATION.

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:17.070 region:rollup2
IN A CAPACITY IN STAFFING

01:51:15.369 --> 01:51:18.672 region:rollup2
IMPLICATION FOR COMMUNITIES.

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:20.641 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED

01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:21.742 region:rollup2
WAS ABOUT THE FINANCING PIECE SO

01:51:20.641 --> 01:51:23.277 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A SHOVEL READY

01:51:21.742 --> 01:51:25.178 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN YOU READY TO GET INTO

01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:26.613 region:rollup2
THE GROUND BUT YOU HAVE A BILL

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:28.148 region:rollup2
YOU TAX INCREMENT FINANCING UP.

01:51:26.613 --> 01:51:30.484 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU GET THAT PROJECT

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:31.818 region:rollup2
GOING SO THIS IS WHERE THE IDEA

01:51:30.484 --> 01:51:33.554 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:35.322 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH OTHER INVESTORS TO

01:51:33.554 --> 01:51:36.690 region:rollup2
COMMIT ON THE FRONT END? IS

01:51:35.322 --> 01:51:38.592 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE WHAT YOU NEED TO GET

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:40.727 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT GOING AS YOU BUILD

01:51:38.592 --> 01:51:41.929 region:rollup2
THE INCREMENT. BUT WITH THE

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:43.964 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT ONE OF THE FINANCING

01:51:41.929 --> 01:51:45.432 region:rollup2
TOOLS CAN BE THE BONDS BUT IF

01:51:43.964 --> 01:51:46.934 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO GO FOR VOTER

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:48.468 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FOR FIFTY FIVE PERCENT

01:51:46.934 --> 01:51:49.736 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T GET THE BOND

01:51:48.468 --> 01:51:51.772 region:rollup2
APPROVAL THEN YOU LOSE THE

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:52.806 region:rollup2
FUNDING ALSO. SO YOU KNOW YOU

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:54.575 region:rollup2
SORT OF YOU DON'T HAVE AN

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:55.342 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT OF YOUR FUNDING

01:51:54.575 --> 01:51:56.843 region:rollup2
SOURCES SO.

01:51:55.342 --> 01:51:58.378 region:rollup2
WHAT THE OF PRIMER BASICALLY

01:51:56.843 --> 01:52:00.113 region:rollup2
SAID IN CONSULTATION WITH A LOT

01:51:58.378 --> 01:52:01.315 region:rollup2
OF PRACTITIONERS IS THAT THESE

01:52:00.113 --> 01:52:03.083 region:rollup2
TOOLS HAVE THE GREATEST

01:52:01.315 --> 01:52:04.418 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS? WHEN

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:05.552 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF

01:52:04.418 --> 01:52:07.721 region:rollup2
FINANCING AUTHORITIES

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:09.256 region:rollup2
COLLABORATING TOGETHER WHO WHICH

01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:11.258 region:rollup2
OR HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO MOVE THE

01:52:09.256 --> 01:52:12.359 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TOGETHER FOR FORWARD

01:52:11.258 --> 01:52:14.695 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE STRONG

01:52:12.359 --> 01:52:15.562 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND I THINK

01:52:14.695 --> 01:52:16.163 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:18.265 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IS THE

01:52:16.163 --> 01:52:18.765 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION BUT AGAIN IT TAKES

01:52:18.265 --> 01:52:19.967 region:rollup2
TIME TO PUT PARTNERSHIP

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:21.335 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:52:19.967 --> 01:52:22.836 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST A

01:52:21.335 --> 01:52:23.937 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:25.906 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:27.841 region:rollup2
.

01:52:25.906 --> 01:52:29.409 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SUGGESTION WAS THAT YOU

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:31.411 region:rollup2
NEED TO THINK OF THE I HAVE TO

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:33.046 region:rollup2
USE AS BEST USED AS PART OF A

01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:33.947 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND NOT AS A

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:36.116 region:rollup2
ONE OFF.

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:37.884 region:rollup2
FOR PROJECT LEVEL FINANCING

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:39.853 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:42.022 region:rollup2
FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF. A

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:43.757 region:rollup2
FUNDING STRUCTURES AND IT DOES

01:52:42.022 --> 01:52:45.926 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF

01:52:43.757 --> 01:52:47.160 region:rollup2
ANY IFD CAN BE CUMBERSOME AND

01:52:45.926 --> 01:52:49.296 region:rollup2
COSTLY BECAUSE OF JUST

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:51.031 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE TIME. PROJECT

01:52:49.296 --> 01:52:53.567 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT PROJECT FINANCING IN

01:52:51.031 --> 01:52:55.435 region:rollup2
FUNDING TRACKING AND THE LOCAL

01:52:53.567 --> 01:52:57.537 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:58.972 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES. KNOW WE HAD TALKED

01:52:57.537 --> 01:53:00.007 region:rollup2
IN THIS REGION WITH THE RAIL

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:01.875 region:rollup2
YARDS IT'S THE BIGGEST INFILL

01:53:00.007 --> 01:53:03.010 region:rollup2
PROJECT WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:04.945 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO ANY I

01:53:03.010 --> 01:53:06.446 region:rollup2
HAVE DE THEIR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:04.945 --> 01:53:08.782 region:rollup2
INCLUDING BROADBAND. AND YOU

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:09.716 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT

01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:11.151 region:rollup2
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO.

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:12.519 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL BUT WE

01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:13.854 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:15.656 region:rollup2
IT TAKES TO PUT THESE PIECES

01:53:13.854 --> 01:53:17.391 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:53:15.656 --> 01:53:18.692 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF OUR OBSERVATIONS ARE

01:53:17.391 --> 01:53:20.527 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:53:18.692 --> 01:53:21.662 region:rollup2
THE THE PROCESS CAN BE

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:23.530 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE.

01:53:21.662 --> 01:53:24.698 region:rollup2
.

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:26.566 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE ISSUE OF

01:53:24.698 --> 01:53:28.235 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:29.403 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:53:28.235 --> 01:53:31.038 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF CAPACITY TO

01:53:29.403 --> 01:53:32.873 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS AND PARTNERS TO

01:53:31.038 --> 01:53:34.041 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS. WOULD BE

01:53:32.873 --> 01:53:35.976 region:rollup2
REALLY USEFUL IN THIS IS WHERE

01:53:34.041 --> 01:53:38.045 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH.

01:53:35.976 --> 01:53:39.579 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTIONS AND THE WEEK

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:40.981 region:rollup2
GROUPS LIKE CAL LEAD WHICH HAVE

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:41.682 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A FINANCING

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:43.316 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO COULD BE VERY

01:53:41.682 --> 01:53:44.885 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:46.286 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONSIDER MARKET

01:53:44.885 --> 01:53:47.821 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AND ADDRESSING THE

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:49.122 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WHEN MARKETS DOWNTURN

01:53:47.821 --> 01:53:50.891 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE TAX

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:52.225 region:rollup2
INCREMENT REVENUES AND HOW THAT

01:53:50.891 --> 01:53:53.160 region:rollup2
MATCHES TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:54.361 region:rollup2
COSTS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.829 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

01:53:54.361 --> 01:53:57.597 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:59.499 region:rollup2
HAVE CONSIDERATION FOR LONG TERM

01:53:57.597 --> 01:54:01.601 region:rollup2
FINANCING OUT FOR PROJECTS

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:03.403 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL ON A LONG

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:05.439 region:rollup2
TERM TIME CYCLE.

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:07.240 region:rollup2
SO THE IDEA PARTNERSHIPS AND

01:54:05.439 --> 01:54:09.743 region:rollup2
INVESTORS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:11.144 region:rollup2
FOR RURAL AREAS. THIS BURLY

01:54:09.743 --> 01:54:13.113 region:rollup2
AREAS HIGH CAPACITY CHALLENGES

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:14.147 region:rollup2
BEFORE. REDEVELOPMENT EVER WENT

01:54:13.113 --> 01:54:16.083 region:rollup2
AWAY.

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:18.452 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO CONSIDER TO THAT

01:54:16.083 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS IN MANY PARTS OF THE

01:54:18.452 --> 01:54:21.421 region:rollup2
STATE INCLUDING THIS REGION CAN

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:23.023 region:rollup2
ALSO NOT USE MANY OF THE

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:24.091 region:rollup2
FINANCING TOOLS THAT THAT ARE

01:54:23.023 --> 01:54:25.292 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:54:24.091 --> 01:54:26.460 region:rollup2
AGENCIES BECAUSE OF WORLD

01:54:25.292 --> 01:54:27.761 region:rollup2
DEFINITION ISSUES.

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:29.296 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ABOUT TRYING

01:54:27.761 --> 01:54:30.530 region:rollup2
TO LAYER MULTIPLE SOURCES OF

01:54:29.296 --> 01:54:31.998 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT'S REALLY BEEN A

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.700 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINT FOR US.

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:35.469 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:37.571 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS DO HAVE TECHNICAL

01:54:35.469 --> 01:54:39.106 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE A CAPACITY BUILDING.

01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:40.107 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF WE COULD LEVERAGE

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:41.708 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE THAT WOULD BE

01:54:40.107 --> 01:54:43.777 region:rollup2
VALUABLE VOTE WE MIGHT LOOK AT

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:46.313 region:rollup2
REPLICATING SOME OF THOSE TOOLS

01:54:43.777 --> 01:54:48.448 region:rollup2
ON OUR OWN. OF FINANCING

01:54:46.313 --> 01:54:49.583 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:51.718 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

01:54:49.583 --> 01:54:53.253 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT IN RURAL AREAS

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:54.921 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT BUILD HOUSING

01:54:53.253 --> 01:54:55.756 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:57.758 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WITHOUT SOME CORE

01:54:55.756 --> 01:54:59.092 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING WATER

01:54:57.758 --> 01:55:01.128 region:rollup2
AND SEWER AND WASTE WATER

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:03.263 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROADBAND.

01:55:01.128 --> 01:55:05.132 region:rollup2
SO. AGAIN RURAL AREAS HAVE

01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:06.366 region:rollup2
FURTHER CONSTRAINTS EVEN GET

01:55:05.132 --> 01:55:07.768 region:rollup2
INTO THE REVITALIZATION AND

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:10.103 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT PROCESS THESE ARE

01:55:07.768 --> 01:55:12.072 region:rollup2
BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:13.774 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN DIRE CONDITION IN

01:55:12.072 --> 01:55:15.075 region:rollup2
MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA.

01:55:13.774 --> 01:55:16.176 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A NEW REPORT THAT JUST

01:55:15.075 --> 01:55:18.245 region:rollup2
CAME OUT FROM THE CENTER FOR

01:55:16.176 --> 01:55:19.946 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CHANGE CHANGE YOU ARE

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:21.515 region:rollup2
WELL AWARE OF THE UP TO WATER

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:23.950 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS IN THIS AND WE CAN

01:55:21.515 --> 01:55:25.285 region:rollup2
VALLEY. AND THAT'S A BARRIER TO

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:26.686 region:rollup2
USING ANY KIND OF THESE TOOLS

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:29.823 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BASELINE CONDITIONS

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:30.690 region:rollup2
ARE SO ARE ARE SO IMPAIRED.

01:55:29.823 --> 01:55:32.726 region:rollup2
SO.

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:35.328 region:rollup2
JUST AS A FEW.

01:55:32.726 --> 01:55:37.030 region:rollup2
OTHER INSIGHTS LAST IN THE LAST

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:39.332 region:rollup2
DECADE WE DID A LOT OF WORK WITH

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:40.634 region:rollup2
THE WITH THE CABINET AND THE US

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:42.169 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL LOOKING

01:55:40.634 --> 01:55:43.236 region:rollup2
AT.

01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:45.005 region:rollup2
KIND OF URBAN AND RURAL

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:46.873 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES IN DIFFERENCES IN

01:55:45.005 --> 01:55:48.041 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND.

01:55:46.873 --> 01:55:49.876 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER AS A

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:51.678 region:rollup2
STATE THAT RURAL AREAS CONTINUE

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:53.346 region:rollup2
TO GROW LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:55.382 region:rollup2
ADDED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:56.516 region:rollup2
THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND. THE SOME

01:55:55.382 --> 01:55:58.018 region:rollup2
OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ARE AMONG

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:59.553 region:rollup2
THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN

01:55:58.018 --> 01:56:00.987 region:rollup2
THE STATE SO WE WE ALL HAVE AN

01:55:59.553 --> 01:56:02.689 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:04.124 region:rollup2
CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS GROWTH AND

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:05.592 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE WAY.

01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:07.527 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING CHALLENGES WILL BE

01:56:05.592 --> 01:56:08.829 region:rollup2
FURTHER EXACERBATED WITH THE

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:09.996 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THE FIRES IN THE

01:56:08.829 --> 01:56:11.164 region:rollup2
FLOODS IN THE OTHER NATURAL

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:13.467 region:rollup2
DISASTERS.

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:15.068 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO BE REALLY

01:56:13.467 --> 01:56:16.970 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF HOW WE

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:18.672 region:rollup2
CAN ACCELERATE THE ABILITY OF

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:20.607 region:rollup2
THESE TOOLS TO HELP US RECOVER.

01:56:18.672 --> 01:56:21.741 region:rollup2
AND BE RESILIENT IN TERMS OF OUR

01:56:20.607 --> 01:56:23.777 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS.

01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:25.812 region:rollup2
.

01:56:23.777 --> 01:56:27.080 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO THINK I THINK

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:29.015 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.518 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING EQUITY IN OUR

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:32.118 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FROM

01:56:31.518 --> 01:56:34.621 region:rollup2
STATE LEVELS NOT JUST THROUGH

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:36.423 region:rollup2
THE. TAX INCREMENT TOOLS BUT

01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:37.891 region:rollup2
OTHER KINDS OF BONDS AND AND

01:56:36.423 --> 01:56:39.392 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THEY OFTEN

01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:41.428 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED RURAL AREAS IN

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:43.263 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION CRITERIA

01:56:41.428 --> 01:56:43.864 region:rollup2
AND THE PROGRAM GUIDELINES WITH

01:56:43.263 --> 01:56:47.133 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE.

01:56:43.864 --> 01:56:49.169 region:rollup2
MATCH REQUIREMENTS POPULATION

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:51.571 region:rollup2
THRESHOLDS AND EXCLUSION OF

01:56:49.169 --> 01:56:53.406 region:rollup2
RURAL OR SMALLER COMMUNITIES.

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:55.642 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:57.043 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR US I THINK WE COULD

01:56:55.642 --> 01:56:58.712 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOK AT.

01:56:57.043 --> 01:57:00.881 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS LIKE CAP

01:56:58.712 --> 01:57:02.449 region:rollup2
AND TRADE BOND MEASURES AND HOW

01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:04.184 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE LEVERAGED.

01:57:02.449 --> 01:57:05.719 region:rollup2
SO THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:06.853 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE TO

01:57:05.719 --> 01:57:08.255 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME INFRASTRUCTURE

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:09.756 region:rollup2
NEEDS THAT SOME CORE NEEDS CAN

01:57:08.255 --> 01:57:11.658 region:rollup2
BE MET AND THEN THE COMMUNITIES

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:12.559 region:rollup2
CAN WORK ON. KIND OF THE VALUE

01:57:11.658 --> 01:57:14.094 region:rollup2
AT AROUND REVITALIZATION

01:57:12.559 --> 01:57:15.462 region:rollup2
PROJECTS

01:57:14.094 --> 01:57:17.330 region:rollup2
I THINK PROVIDING CAPACITY

01:57:15.462 --> 01:57:18.899 region:rollup2
BUILDING TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:20.300 region:rollup2
AND ACCESSING IN LEVERAGE OF

01:57:18.899 --> 01:57:21.835 region:rollup2
BEING THE FUNDING IN PUTTING.

01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:23.470 region:rollup2
THE TI OF STRUCTURES IN PLACE

01:57:21.835 --> 01:57:24.304 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE ALONG

01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:26.539 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER VEHICLES AND

01:57:24.304 --> 01:57:28.074 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS AYE UNLIKE THE IDEA

01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:30.210 region:rollup2
OF THE. THE INVESTMENT VEHICLES

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:30.677 region:rollup2
THESE KIND OF MECHANISMS CAN

01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:32.712 region:rollup2
HELP ALL COMMUNITIES.

01:57:30.677 --> 01:57:35.615 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:36.583 region:rollup2
PAST THERE UPSTATE PROGRAMS LIKE

01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:37.984 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

01:57:36.583 --> 01:57:39.753 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT USE TO

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:41.421 region:rollup2
HAVE CIRCUIT RIDERS WHO WOULD GO

01:57:39.753 --> 01:57:42.355 region:rollup2
OUT AND ASSIST RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:57:41.421 --> 01:57:44.157 region:rollup2
AND PUTTING PROJECTS AND

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:46.159 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS TOGETHER. AND HELPING

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:46.860 region:rollup2
THEM GET READY TO TO PUT THE

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:48.461 region:rollup2
TOOLS IN PLACE

01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:51.298 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THOSE KIND OF.

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:52.799 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS COULD BE LOOKED AT.

01:57:51.298 --> 01:57:55.068 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ANOTHER THING

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:56.436 region:rollup2
THE STATE COULD DO IS ADVOCATE

01:57:55.068 --> 01:57:58.204 region:rollup2
FOR CHANGES IN RURAL DEFINITION

01:57:56.436 --> 01:57:59.172 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT

01:57:58.204 --> 01:58:01.174 region:rollup2
WOULD UNLOCK A FUNDING SOURCE

01:57:59.172 --> 01:58:02.342 region:rollup2
FOR US.

01:58:01.174 --> 01:58:04.110 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR PLANNING AND

01:58:02.342 --> 01:58:06.313 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION FOR BUT THIS FOR

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:07.581 region:rollup2
CAPACITY BUILDING PEACE.

01:58:06.313 --> 01:58:07.781 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT

01:58:07.581 --> 01:58:09.549 region:rollup2
THE.

01:58:07.781 --> 01:58:11.851 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:13.553 region:rollup2
WHICH IS COMPRISED OF REGIONS

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:16.122 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE WORKING ON.

01:58:13.553 --> 01:58:18.158 region:rollup2
PROSPERITY AND OF HOUSING WATER

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:20.660 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WELL AS

01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:21.695 region:rollup2
SKILLS DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE A

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:23.530 region:rollup2
NEW STRATEGY CALLED A WILL BE

01:58:21.695 --> 01:58:25.699 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THEY REALLY ARE

01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:26.833 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON. WORLD PROSPERITY

01:58:25.699 --> 01:58:28.101 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:30.303 region:rollup2
RURAL CALIFORNIA'S NOT LEFT

01:58:28.101 --> 01:58:32.505 region:rollup2
BEHIND SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:32.973 region:rollup2
THAT A VERY GOOD PARTNER IN

01:58:32.505 --> 01:58:33.974 region:rollup2
ADVANCING SOME OF THE

01:58:32.973 --> 01:58:36.242 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE.

01:58:33.974 --> 01:58:37.711 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES AND PROPOSALS.

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:40.080 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY.

01:58:37.711 --> 01:58:41.748 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN BROADBAND

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:43.083 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A BROADWAY

01:58:41.748 --> 01:58:44.284 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IF WE COULD LEVERAGE

01:58:43.083 --> 01:58:45.552 region:rollup2
SOME CAP AND TRADE MONEY WOULD

01:58:44.284 --> 01:58:47.053 region:rollup2
HELP US MEET SOME OF OUR

01:58:45.552 --> 01:58:48.588 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS REDUCE.

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:50.323 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:51.558 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:53.860 region:rollup2
US TO USE OTHER KINDS OF.

01:58:51.558 --> 01:58:55.695 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:57.063 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY THAT ARE RURAL AND

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:59.332 region:rollup2
URBAN AREAS ARE INTO JAPAN

01:58:57.063 --> 01:59:00.867 region:rollup2
INTERDEPENDENT OUR LOCAL COUNCIL

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:02.902 region:rollup2
OF GOVERNMENTS HAS DONE RESEARCH

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:04.904 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY JOB.

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:07.374 region:rollup2
IN THE OFF ON FIRM AREA IT

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:09.175 region:rollup2
GENERATES TWO JOBS OFFER SO WE

01:59:07.374 --> 01:59:11.077 region:rollup2
ALL NEED TO RISE TOGETHER AND WE

01:59:09.175 --> 01:59:14.381 region:rollup2
ALL HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

01:59:11.077 --> 01:59:15.415 region:rollup2
KEEPING RURAL CALIFORNIA STRONG.

01:59:14.381 --> 01:59:18.118 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THIS KILLING SUSAN.

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:23.556 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:25.558 region:rollup2
WE MAKE SURE THAT. REAL

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:27.627 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE TABLE.

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:28.928 region:rollup2
AND HOW. THE O. SEEMS LIKE MANY

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:30.764 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:32.098 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THERE. AND HOW DO WE.

01:59:30.764 --> 01:59:33.967 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:35.502 region:rollup2

THROUGH LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS

01:59:39.973 --> 01:59:43.143 region:rollup2
LIKE C. SACK IN THE LEAGUE IN RC

01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:44.677 region:rollup2

THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTED

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:53.987 region:rollup2
PARTIES THAT WANT TO HELP AND

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:55.855 region:rollup2
THAT CAN HELP GET THE RURAL

01:59:53.987 --> 01:59:57.090 region:rollup2
VOICE I THINK TO THE TABLE. AND

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:59.659 region:rollup2
I THINK WE DO NEED TO BE MINDFUL

01:59:57.090 --> 02:00:02.095 region:rollup2

01:59:59.659 --> 02:00:03.930 region:rollup2

02:00:02.095 --> 02:00:05.365 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:06.733 region:rollup2
VOICE IS HEARD AND I THINK WE

02:00:05.365 --> 02:00:09.736 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE

02:00:06.733 --> 02:00:10.403 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE AGENCIES AS WELL

02:00:09.736 --> 02:00:11.871 region:rollup2

VOICE NEEDS TO DEFINITELY BE

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:18.378 region:rollup2
PRESENT.

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:20.480 region:rollup2
SO.

YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION IT'S

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:26.252 region:rollup2
CUT HIM MAYBE THINK ABOUT A FEW

02:00:26.019 --> 02:00:27.854 region:rollup2
THINGS.

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:29.222 region:rollup2
.

02:00:27.854 --> 02:00:30.924 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS SOUTH

02:00:29.222 --> 02:00:33.193 region:rollup2
WAS RIVERSIDE AND.

02:00:30.924 --> 02:00:34.794 region:rollup2
NORTH INLAND SAN DIEGO SO IT'S

02:00:33.193 --> 02:00:37.297 region:rollup2
KIND OF A MORE.

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:38.798 region:rollup2
RURAL AREA. BUT.

02:00:37.297 --> 02:00:39.199 region:rollup2
THE ONE OF THE BIG CITIES

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:40.467 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ESCONDIDO.

02:00:39.199 --> 02:00:42.569 region:rollup2
.

02:00:40.467 --> 02:00:44.838 region:rollup2
IS AN OLDER CITY INCORPORATED IN

02:00:42.569 --> 02:00:46.573 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE

02:00:44.838 --> 02:00:49.075 region:rollup2
PIPES ON THE GROUND. ARE

02:00:46.573 --> 02:00:50.643 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:52.412 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:54.347 region:rollup2
REVITALIZATION AND.

02:00:52.412 --> 02:00:56.116 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EVEN WHAT WE WERE

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:57.851 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO IT WE DEVELOPMENT

02:00:56.116 --> 02:00:59.119 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

02:00:57.851 --> 02:01:01.354 region:rollup2
AROUND THEIR SPECIALLY AROUND

02:00:59.119 --> 02:01:02.722 region:rollup2
THE RAIL STATION. WITHOUT.

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.957 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING ALL THE

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:04.891 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE UNDER

02:01:03.957 --> 02:01:06.426 region:rollup2
THE GROUND THE WATER AND THE

02:01:04.891 --> 02:01:08.995 region:rollup2
SEWER.

02:01:06.426 --> 02:01:10.396 region:rollup2
TOM WE'VE GOT POWER LINES THAT

02:01:08.995 --> 02:01:12.398 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE UNDERGROUND LETS YOU

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:13.900 region:rollup2
KNOW MULTI MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:14.801 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT ALONG

02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.304 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:19.038 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING. TO GET US. IN

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:20.740 region:rollup2
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE.

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:22.442 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THE AREA BECAUSE

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.310 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME WE GET YOU KNOW

02:01:22.442 --> 02:01:27.413 region:rollup2
WILLING PEOPLE COMING IN TO LOOK

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:28.715 region:rollup2
AT. REVITALIZATION EVERYONE WAS

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:29.949 region:rollup2
STOPPED AND TURNED AWAY BECAUSE

02:01:28.715 --> 02:01:31.718 region:rollup2
OF THE COST OF THAT

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:33.286 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW.

02:01:31.718 --> 02:01:34.487 region:rollup2
UPGRADING.

02:01:33.286 --> 02:01:36.089 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:38.424 region:rollup2
HAVE SOUTH OF THE GRAPEVINE

02:01:36.089 --> 02:01:40.527 region:rollup2
WHICH ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:42.128 region:rollup2
BEING IN SACRAMENTO IS.

02:01:40.527 --> 02:01:44.130 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SELL WELL IN ORANGE

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:44.697 region:rollup2
COUNTY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR LA

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:46.1000 region:rollup2
WELL WE'RE FURTHER. AND YOU

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:49.669 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:01:46.1000 --> 02:01:50.203 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO INLAND AND IMPERIAL

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:52.639 region:rollup2
EVEN ARE KIND OF THE BACK

02:01:50.203 --> 02:01:55.175 region:rollup2
BURNER.

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:57.477 region:rollup2
WE HAVE. A LACK OF RELIABLE

02:01:55.175 --> 02:01:58.111 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY SO IF WE WANNA

02:01:57.477 --> 02:02:00.180 region:rollup2
START TALKING ABOUT

02:01:58.111 --> 02:02:01.848 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING AND

02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:03.683 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE THINGS OF THAT

02:02:01.848 --> 02:02:06.486 region:rollup2
REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:08.755 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU WE GO TOO FAR SO IT'S

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:10.657 region:rollup2
ALMOST LIKE THESE THINGS HAVE TO

02:02:08.755 --> 02:02:12.025 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE YOU CAN

02:02:10.657 --> 02:02:12.292 region:rollup2
EVEN GET TO THAT SO.

02:02:12.025 --> 02:02:14.194 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:16.029 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE AT THE PROCESS

02:02:14.194 --> 02:02:17.764 region:rollup2
EASIER WHEN WE DID THE BONDS IN

02:02:16.029 --> 02:02:18.865 region:rollup2
THE LAST DECADE PEOPLE LOOKED AT

02:02:17.764 --> 02:02:21.234 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE CREATES A

02:02:18.865 --> 02:02:22.635 region:rollup2
COURSE OUR CROP ACROSS OUR CORE

02:02:21.234 --> 02:02:23.970 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SO.

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:25.271 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT EVERY TIME PEOPLE

02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:26.773 region:rollup2
DIG INTO THE GROUND AND THEY GET

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:28.942 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CONDITION OF THINGS

02:02:26.773 --> 02:02:30.376 region:rollup2
IT'S A BARRIER AND IT ADDS A LOT

02:02:28.942 --> 02:02:32.445 region:rollup2
OF COSTS TO REDEVELOPMENT

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:33.913 region:rollup2
PROJECTS SO. I THINK THE OTHER

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:34.714 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THAT THAT WE COULD BE

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:36.482 region:rollup2
LOOKING OUT HIS WATER NEW

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:37.550 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED

02:02:36.482 --> 02:02:39.352 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BUILD RESILIENCE

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:41.354 region:rollup2
INTO BUILDING SUPPLIES AND AND

02:02:39.352 --> 02:02:42.956 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT DOUBLE.

02:02:41.354 --> 02:02:44.858 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IN BETTER SAID IN THE

02:02:42.956 --> 02:02:47.126 region:rollup2
FUTURE FOR RESILIENCE BECAUSE

02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:49.395 region:rollup2
THESE THESE DISASTERS ARE

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:50.496 region:rollup2
POINTING OUT THAT THE NEED FOR

02:02:49.395 --> 02:02:51.531 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE AND ARE PLANNING.

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:53.066 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FROM AN ECONOMIC

02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:54.534 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT STANDPOINT WE TRY TO

02:02:53.066 --> 02:02:55.802 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT AS DRIVERS OF

02:02:54.534 --> 02:02:58.371 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AROUND NEW

02:02:55.802 --> 02:03:00.073 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESS SEASON.

02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:02.208 region:rollup2
BUILDING MATERIALS THAT CAN ALSO

02:03:00.073 --> 02:03:03.610 region:rollup2
BE MAY BE SOMETHING WITH THAT WE

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:04.110 region:rollup2
CAN BUILD OUR OWN. OUTLET

02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:08.514 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING AND OTHER

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:10.617 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:11.985 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION JUST

02:03:10.617 --> 02:03:12.185 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT YOU WATCHING

02:03:11.985 --> 02:03:14.020 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:03:12.185 --> 02:03:17.156 region:rollup2

CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN BECAUSE I

02:03:18.658 --> 02:03:21.761 region:rollup2
THINK MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:23.730 region:rollup2
THAT IS A BARRIER FOR MANY OF US

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:25.031 region:rollup2
WHO.

02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:27.033 region:rollup2
THERE FEDERAL AGENCIES

02:03:25.031 --> 02:03:28.134 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY YOU STA DEPARTMENT OF

02:03:27.033 --> 02:03:30.203 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY FACILITIES BUT WE ARE

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:37.443 region:rollup2
LOCKED OUT OF THAT FUNDING. IN

02:03:35.375 --> 02:03:39.512 region:rollup2
MOST OF OUR AREAS OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:37.443 --> 02:03:40.880 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE. ARE TOO CLOSE TO

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:42.715 region:rollup2
URBAN OR METROPOLITAN AYE

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.250 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THOSE DEFINITIONS WERE

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:47.253 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED REALLY FOR THE MIDWEST

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:48.755 region:rollup2
WHERE. WERE OF RURAL AREAS OR.

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:51.291 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM CITIES

02:03:48.755 --> 02:03:52.825 region:rollup2

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:59.299 region:rollup2
OF IT AS SUCH AS RURAL IN

02:03:57.664 --> 02:04:00.566 region:rollup2
CHARACTER SO A COMMUNITY LIKE

WINTERS WOULD THEREFORE BE

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:04.037 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS

02:04:02.502 --> 02:04:05.605 region:rollup2

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:42.335 region:rollup2
THAT REPORT.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.870 region:rollup2

IS A CHART.

02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:47.006 region:rollup2
IN TIED TO THE ELIMINATION OF

SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN.

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:57.984 region:rollup2
AND THAT CHART.

02:05:55.281 --> 02:06:00.386 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE

02:05:57.984 --> 02:06:01.320 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR LOW AND

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:03.923 region:rollup2
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WERE

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:04.957 region:rollup2
REDUCED THEY WERE ELIMINATED IT

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:06.592 region:rollup2
WAS ZERO.

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:08.061 region:rollup2
.

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:10.263 region:rollup2
FROM A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO

02:06:08.061 --> 02:06:12.532 region:rollup2
NONE. AND SO CUMULATIVELY.

02:06:10.263 --> 02:06:13.699 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOST SOME SIX BILLION

02:06:12.532 --> 02:06:15.168 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT WERE DIRECTED FOR

LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING

02:06:15.168 --> 02:06:18.337 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:20.173 region:rollup2
THAT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:22.975 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR.

02:06:20.173 --> 02:06:24.844 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT TO DO. DISSOLUTION

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:26.112 region:rollup2
ACT DOESN'T DIRECT ANY OF THE

02:06:24.844 --> 02:06:27.947 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO GO FOR LOW AND MODERATE

02:06:26.112 --> 02:06:29.015 region:rollup2

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:31.551 region:rollup2
AND.

02:06:29.015 --> 02:06:33.219 region:rollup2
SO THEN I'M I'M GONNA TALK A

02:06:31.551 --> 02:06:35.855 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE

02:06:33.219 --> 02:06:37.957 region:rollup2
EXISTING TAX INCREMENT IS USED.

02:06:35.855 --> 02:06:38.758 region:rollup2
STARTING WITH THAT I HAD THIS

ONE PAGER.

02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:41.494 region:rollup2
WHICH.

02:06:39.792 --> 02:06:42.862 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH WOULD BETTER IN

02:06:41.494 --> 02:06:44.297 region:rollup2
COLOR A HUFF.

02:06:42.862 --> 02:06:46.999 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT DESCRIBES HOW.

02:06:44.297 --> 02:06:49.802 region:rollup2
W. AS AS WE ALL KNOW.

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:51.270 region:rollup2
NO ONE PAGE OF TAX INCREMENT

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:53.906 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION BEFORE DISSOLUTION

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:54.440 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WENT

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.374 region:rollup2
TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.510 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:59.846 region:rollup2

REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:05.318 region:rollup2
WITH GIVING LARGE JUST LARGE

DISCRETION TO THE LOCAL

02:07:05.318 --> 02:07:08.120 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THE LOCAL

AND.

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:20.466 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF AGENCIES DIDN'T

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:21.701 region:rollup2
EXPEND THOSE LOW AND MODERATE

CREW SO MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS AND

02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:31.410 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO BE EXPANDED BECAUSE

02:07:30.243 --> 02:07:33.412 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WERE EXPENDING THEM.

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:35.014 region:rollup2
WELL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:37.083 region:rollup2

02:08:22.328 --> 02:08:26.732 region:rollup2
DOWN AB TWENTY SEVEN.

02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:28.701 region:rollup2
AND SURPRISING TO ALL OBSERVERS

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:30.469 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE PRACTITIONERS NOT

02:08:28.701 --> 02:08:31.771 region:rollup2
ONLY. WE THOUGHT A FEW THE

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.805 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WOULD GO

02:08:31.771 --> 02:08:34.307 region:rollup2
WAY WE LOSE SOME OF THE SLOWING

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:35.841 region:rollup2
MUCH FUND WE LOST A HUNDRED

02:08:34.307 --> 02:08:37.176 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF IT. ALL FOUR HUNDRED

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:39.812 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN AGENCIES WERE

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:41.614 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED UNDER SCHEME THAT WAS

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:43.349 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY DESIGNED FOR STATE

02:08:41.614 --> 02:08:45.551 region:rollup2
WIDE APPLICATION.

02:08:43.349 --> 02:08:47.286 region:rollup2
AND IT DID SPAWN LITIGATION

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:49.322 region:rollup2
THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED CASES WERE

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:50.756 region:rollup2
BROUGHT. ONLY A HANDFUL OF THOSE

02:08:49.322 --> 02:08:52.124 region:rollup2
CASES HAD TO DO IT LOW AND

02:08:50.756 --> 02:08:54.994 region:rollup2
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING THOUGH

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:57.163 region:rollup2
SO JUST A TINY FRACTION. HAD TO

02:08:54.994 --> 02:08:58.130 region:rollup2
DO WITH HOUSING AND.

02:08:57.163 --> 02:08:59.565 region:rollup2
.

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:00.566 region:rollup2
ALL OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:02.902 region:rollup2
HOUSING FUNDS THAT WERE

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:04.270 region:rollup2
REMAINING WERE SWEPT.

02:09:02.902 --> 02:09:05.271 region:rollup2
SO NONE OF THE THE REMAINING LOW

02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:08.107 region:rollup2
AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING

02:09:05.271 --> 02:09:09.642 region:rollup2
FUNDS WERE LEFT SO WE ARE IN A

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:10.409 region:rollup2
SITUATION NOW IN THIS IS THE

02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
KIND OF SECOND.

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:14.513 region:rollup2
SLIDE THAT I HAVE OF WHERE

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.015 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE

02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:18.284 region:rollup2
BEING PAID BY THE BY THE

02:09:16.015 --> 02:09:19.785 region:rollup2
SUCCESSOR AGENCIES EVERY YEAR

02:09:18.284 --> 02:09:21.287 region:rollup2
THE SUCCESSOR AGENCIES CREATE A

02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:23.122 region:rollup2
LIST OF IMPORTS OF OBLIGATIONS.

02:09:21.287 --> 02:09:24.590 region:rollup2
AND TYPICALLY THE EIGHTY PERCENT

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:27.360 region:rollup2
CITE THE COMMERCIAL

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:28.461 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT WITH. WAS SECURED

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.296 region:rollup2
TO BONDED INDEBTEDNESS

02:09:28.461 --> 02:09:31.364 region:rollup2
AND THOSE BONDS HAVE PRIORITY

02:09:30.296 --> 02:09:32.331 region:rollup2
ENTERED THE DISSOLUTION ACT IN

02:09:31.364 --> 02:09:33.733 region:rollup2
THOSE BONDS ARE GENERALLY

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:36.135 region:rollup2
GETTING FUNDED.

02:09:33.733 --> 02:09:38.304 region:rollup2
BUT FOR MOST AGENCIES

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:40.106 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T ENGAGE IN BONDING ON

02:09:38.304 --> 02:09:42.174 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING SIDE THAT MONEY A

02:09:40.106 --> 02:09:42.341 region:rollup2
CRUDE SAT.

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:44.443 region:rollup2
AND.

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.910 region:rollup2
GOT SWEPT AND NOW IT'S NO

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:47.146 region:rollup2
LONGER AN ENFORCEABLE

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:48.314 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION.

02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:49.582 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN SEE IN THIS TREE IN

02:09:48.314 --> 02:09:51.050 region:rollup2
THIS CHART WHERE MOST THAT

02:09:49.582 --> 02:09:53.185 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT MONIES COVER TO

02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:54.687 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS AND THAT

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:56.889 region:rollup2
BOOMERANG FUNDS THAT IS COMING

02:09:54.687 --> 02:09:58.557 region:rollup2
BACK. SOME GOING TO THE SCHOOLS

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:59.859 region:rollup2
A BENEFITING STATE GENERAL FUND

02:09:58.557 --> 02:10:00.793 region:rollup2
MOST OF THAT IS THE TWENTY

02:09:59.859 --> 02:10:02.094 region:rollup2
PERCENT MONEY.

02:10:00.793 --> 02:10:03.663 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:05.431 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:10:03.663 --> 02:10:08.968 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE DISSOLUTION LAW.

02:10:05.431 --> 02:10:11.704 region:rollup2
AND SO BECAUSE THE THE THE

02:10:08.968 --> 02:10:13.572 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT.

02:10:11.704 --> 02:10:14.407 region:rollup2
HOUSING OBLIGATIONS

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:16.175 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT PRINT WE'RE WE'RE

02:10:14.407 --> 02:10:18.010 region:rollup2
WE'RE PROVIDING VERY VERY LITTLE

02:10:16.175 --> 02:10:19.945 region:rollup2
FUNDING AT ALL.

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:21.447 region:rollup2
SO. WE.

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:23.049 region:rollup2
SOME REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

02:10:21.447 --> 02:10:24.383 region:rollup2
TURNING TURNING OVER ARE IN THE

02:10:23.049 --> 02:10:25.751 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:27.119 region:rollup2
DON'T GET ENOUGH.

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:28.554 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS THE

02:10:27.119 --> 02:10:30.089 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY TAX TRUST

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:31.657 region:rollup2
FUND AMOUNTS.

02:10:30.089 --> 02:10:33.025 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THE EXISTING

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:35.161 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS.

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:36.829 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THOSE SUCCESSORS ARE

02:10:35.161 --> 02:10:37.329 region:rollup2
UNDER WATER BUT THAT'S THE RARE

02:10:36.829 --> 02:10:39.231 region:rollup2
CASE.

02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:41.367 region:rollup2
MOST SUCCESSORS HAVE

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:43.569 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

02:10:41.367 --> 02:10:44.870 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY TAX TRUCK

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:45.271 region:rollup2
TRUST FUNDS TO ALLOCATE.

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.839 region:rollup2
AND.

02:10:45.271 --> 02:10:48.774 region:rollup2
AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE

02:10:46.839 --> 02:10:50.743 region:rollup2
INCREASING FROM THE EXISTING

02:10:48.774 --> 02:10:52.144 region:rollup2
PROJECT AREAS AND THE REASON FOR

02:10:50.743 --> 02:10:53.346 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT THE THE

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:54.780 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE

02:10:53.346 --> 02:10:56.649 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED BUT THE PROJECT AREAS

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:58.651 region:rollup2
WERE NOT. THIS PROJECT AREAS

02:10:56.649 --> 02:11:00.720 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO TO GENERATE

02:10:58.651 --> 02:11:02.088 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR AS

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.289 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO REPAY THE ENFORCEABLE

02:11:02.088 --> 02:11:04.523 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS.

02:11:03.289 --> 02:11:06.559 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO CREATING THESE

02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:07.426 region:rollup2
OTHER FUNDS NONE OF WHICH ARE

02:11:06.559 --> 02:11:08.794 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BEING ALLOCATED FOR

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:09.695 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:12.231 region:rollup2
SO.

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:13.599 region:rollup2
.

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:15.468 region:rollup2
I THINK BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:18.070 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL WAY THAT WE ENDED UP

02:11:15.468 --> 02:11:21.540 region:rollup2
pTHERE HASN'T BEEN.

02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:23.242 region:rollup2
THE CAREFUL DEBATE AND DECISION

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:24.977 region:rollup2
MAKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:27.313 region:rollup2
SCHEME WHERE NONE OF THE MONEY

02:11:24.977 --> 02:11:28.347 region:rollup2
GOES FOR HOUSING IS THE SCHEME

02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:29.982 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED.

02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:32.852 region:rollup2
SO.

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:33.352 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL

02:11:32.852 --> 02:11:34.053 region:rollup2
POINT THAT I WANTED TO.

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:36.822 region:rollup2
.

02:11:34.053 --> 02:11:38.924 region:rollup2
BRING TO THE COMMITTEE.

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:40.893 region:rollup2
THEY WERE HAVING QUESTIONS YEAH.

02:11:38.924 --> 02:11:43.129 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS.

02:11:40.893 --> 02:11:45.564 region:rollup2
THANK YOU* ESCONDIDO HAD A

02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:47.533 region:rollup2
VERY ROBUST LOW INCOME HOUSING

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:48.901 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. WE WON QUITE A FEW

02:11:47.533 --> 02:11:51.036 region:rollup2
AWARDS FOR IT.

02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:52.371 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO USE OUR CD BG

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:54.974 region:rollup2
MONIES.

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:56.942 region:rollup2
TO HELP. OFFSET AND WE DEVELOP

02:11:54.974 --> 02:11:58.444 region:rollup2
USING THAT FOR SOME OF THE

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:58.744 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:11:58.444 --> 02:12:00.312 region:rollup2
ONE AROUND.

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:01.781 region:rollup2
.

02:12:00.312 --> 02:12:03.349 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE AN OLDER CITY WE

02:12:01.781 --> 02:12:05.151 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO REALLY.

02:12:03.349 --> 02:12:06.685 region:rollup2
ROOM MAKE AN IMPACT WITH INFILL

02:12:05.151 --> 02:12:08.721 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:12:06.685 --> 02:12:10.589 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS GREAT AND WE CAN ALSO

02:12:08.721 --> 02:12:12.892 region:rollup2
GO IN AND RE DO ALTER.

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:14.160 region:rollup2
.

02:12:12.892 --> 02:12:16.495 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:18.130 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AND CLEAN THE MOP AND

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:19.899 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND WAS AS WE WENT

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:21.467 region:rollup2
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:12:19.899 --> 02:12:24.703 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD LOW INCOME HOUSING.

02:12:21.467 --> 02:12:26.439 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS YOU KNOW UP THERE TO

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:28.374 region:rollup2
WHAT WONDERFUL PROGRAM.

02:12:26.439 --> 02:12:30.209 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GO WHEN WE WILL CLEAN

02:12:28.374 --> 02:12:31.777 region:rollup2
UP AREAS AND THE SURROUNDING

02:12:30.209 --> 02:12:33.546 region:rollup2
AREAS WILL ALSO JOIN IN

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:34.447 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES WITH SPROUT UP

02:12:33.546 --> 02:12:36.549 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH STAR PAINTING

02:12:34.447 --> 02:12:39.685 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST NOT ONLY AREA WE DID.

02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:41.120 region:rollup2
IT REALLY EXPANDED BEYOND THAT

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:43.022 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BEEN SUCH A LOS.

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:45.090 region:rollup2
TO OUR CITIES TO NOT HAVE THAT

02:12:43.022 --> 02:12:46.025 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO KEEP.

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:48.928 region:rollup2
KNOWN DOING ADS.

02:12:46.025 --> 02:12:50.396 region:rollup2
IT'S MY COMMENT.

02:12:48.928 --> 02:12:52.364 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT

02:12:50.396 --> 02:12:53.332 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT DOES THOSE PROJECT

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.900 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT WERE DEVELOPED.

02:12:53.332 --> 02:12:56.368 region:rollup2
GENERATING THE TAX INCREMENT AND

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:58.204 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW ESCONDIDO

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.272 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BUT IN GENERAL DOES

02:12:58.204 --> 02:13:01.640 region:rollup2
PROJECT AREAS ARE ARE CONTINUING

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:04.043 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP THE TAX INCREMENT.

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:05.945 region:rollup2
AND SO DOES FUNDS.

02:13:04.043 --> 02:13:08.781 region:rollup2
COULD BE ALLOCATED.

02:13:05.945 --> 02:13:11.116 region:rollup2
FOR CONTINUING BOTH.

02:13:08.781 --> 02:13:12.585 region:rollup2
THE CITIES AS A TAXING ENTITY

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:13.919 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:13:12.585 --> 02:13:15.688 region:rollup2
MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT.

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:21.227 region:rollup2
HOW HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE

02:13:15.688 --> 02:13:23.162 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED?

02:13:21.227 --> 02:13:24.029 region:rollup2

GIVEN THAT I COUNTIES ROLE IN

NEED FOR HOUSING SOLUTIONS SO

02:13:52.191 --> 02:13:54.560 region:rollup2
WE'VE. WE'VE GOT IN DEEP ON A

02:13:53.726 --> 02:13:55.895 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES

02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:58.030 region:rollup2
AND MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO

02:13:55.895 --> 02:13:59.598 region:rollup2
TAKE IT BACK UP ABOUT THE THIRTY

02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:00.799 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL.

02:13:59.598 --> 02:14:02.001 region:rollup2
RHONDA AND REALLY I LOOKING AT

02:14:00.799 --> 02:14:03.569 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND

02:14:02.001 --> 02:14:05.204 region:rollup2
THESE TOOLS AND THE USE OF

02:14:03.569 --> 02:14:07.072 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT FROM THE

02:14:05.204 --> 02:14:08.440 region:rollup2
COUNTY'S PERSPECTIVE SO.

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:10.009 region:rollup2
WE OF COURSE BELIEVE THAT.

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.442 region:rollup2
COMMITTED ON THE TOOLS CAN BE

02:14:10.009 --> 02:14:20.052 region:rollup2
USEFUL AND CLEAN UP

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:20.920 region:rollup2
REVITALIZATION AND

02:14:20.052 --> 02:14:22.388 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:23.255 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT

02:14:22.388 --> 02:14:24.657 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:25.491 region:rollup2
COUNTIES

02:14:24.657 --> 02:14:28.193 region:rollup2
I DO PROVIDE TO THE SAME

02:14:25.491 --> 02:14:29.595 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:30.796 region:rollup2
KINDA GOING BACK TO LOCAL

02:14:29.595 --> 02:14:31.263 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT FINANCE ONE A ONE A

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:33.632 region:rollup2
LITTLE THAT.

02:14:31.263 --> 02:14:35.267 region:rollup2
SO PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WAS UP

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:37.970 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTIES

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:38.971 region:rollup2
BUDGET I'M SECOND ONLY AFTER

02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:40.306 region:rollup2
STATES OF PENSIONS IT IS THE

02:14:38.971 --> 02:14:42.308 region:rollup2
LARGEST SOURCE OF DISCRETIONARY

02:14:40.306 --> 02:14:44.176 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR COUNTY AND SO. IT'S

02:14:42.308 --> 02:14:45.611 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:47.880 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND QUALITY LIFE SERVICES

02:14:45.611 --> 02:14:49.648 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDE AND IT'S NOT

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.283 region:rollup2
JUST OF COURSE TO RESIDENTS OF

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:52.584 region:rollup2
COUNTIES BUT THOSE SERVICES ALSO

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:54.653 region:rollup2
ARE PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS OF

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:56.588 region:rollup2
CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS

02:14:54.653 --> 02:14:57.756 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:59.158 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:14:57.756 --> 02:15:00.893 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES FOR FORMER

02:14:59.158 --> 02:15:01.827 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND I FTA

02:15:00.893 --> 02:15:02.361 region:rollup2
USER CREE AS ARE ALL THE OTHER

02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:03.228 region:rollup2
NEW TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:15:02.361 --> 02:15:04.964 region:rollup2
PROVIDED.

02:15:03.228 --> 02:15:05.998 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT

02:15:04.964 --> 02:15:08.033 region:rollup2
COULD BE CONSIDERED THE GOLD

02:15:05.998 --> 02:15:09.969 region:rollup2
STANDARD RATE BECAUSE I IT WILL

02:15:08.033 --> 02:15:11.503 region:rollup2
RELIABLY INCREASE OVER TIME AND

02:15:09.969 --> 02:15:13.205 region:rollup2
THE COROLLARY IF YOU INVEST IN

02:15:11.503 --> 02:15:15.474 region:rollup2
THAT PROPERTY IT WILL ALSO

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:16.408 region:rollup2
INCREASE. A THE THE ASSESSED

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:18.510 region:rollup2
VALUE.

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:21.046 region:rollup2
SO BECAUSE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:22.481 region:rollup2
IS DISCRETIONARY IT'S RELIABLE.

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:24.516 region:rollup2
BUT THE LOCAL FUNDING SOURCE

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:26.585 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND UNIQUE

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:28.220 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THOSE REASONS.

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:30.489 region:rollup2
AMONGST OTHER COUNTY BOB

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:31.824 region:rollup2
REVENUE STREAM SO. AT THE TWO

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:34.193 region:rollup2
PRINCIPALS ARE CONCEPTS I WANT

02:15:31.824 --> 02:15:35.160 region:rollup2
TO SHARE MAY SEEM VERY BASIC MAY

02:15:34.193 --> 02:15:37.196 region:rollup2
SEEM OBVIOUS BUT THEY HAVE TO BE

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.130 region:rollup2
SAD IF THERE'S ANY CONVERSATION

02:15:37.196 --> 02:15:40.299 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE USE.

02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:41.767 region:rollup2
OF TAX INCREMENT IN PURSUING

02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:43.369 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT I COMMUNITY

02:15:41.767 --> 02:15:45.204 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND FIRST AND

02:15:43.369 --> 02:15:46.338 region:rollup2
FOREMOST THERE MUST ABSOLUTELY

02:15:45.204 --> 02:15:48.340 region:rollup2
BE CONSENT AMONGST ALL

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:50.476 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING AGENCIES ALL THE

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:51.877 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDERS. OTHERWISE YOU

02:15:50.476 --> 02:15:54.747 region:rollup2
ARE TRAINING CRITICAL REVENUE

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:56.448 region:rollup2
FROM ONE AGENCY FORSAKING THEIR

02:15:54.747 --> 02:15:58.283 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT FOR ANOTHER.

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:59.885 region:rollup2
I. AND THE CONCERN ABOUT

02:15:58.283 --> 02:16:00.919 region:rollup2
COMPELLED PARTICIPATION.

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:02.921 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TELLING THE PUBLIC

02:16:00.919 --> 02:16:06.258 region:rollup2
TAX INCREMENT INTERLOCKING AND

02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:07.559 region:rollup2
ONE AGENCIES FUNDING LEVEL. FOR

02:16:06.258 --> 02:16:09.294 region:rollup2
DECADES POTENTIALLY WHEN THEY

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:11.397 region:rollup2
HAVE ADDITIONAL PROGRAM DEMANDS

02:16:09.294 --> 02:16:13.232 region:rollup2
AND POPULATION CHANGES WELL INTO

02:16:11.397 --> 02:16:14.967 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE AND SO HOW CAN I

02:16:13.232 --> 02:16:15.968 region:rollup2
COUNTY MEET THOSE CHANGING NEEDS

02:16:14.967 --> 02:16:18.337 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

02:16:15.968 --> 02:16:19.838 region:rollup2
GIVEN SUCH LIMITED REVENUE

02:16:18.337 --> 02:16:21.306 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IN OTHER AREAS.

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:21.840 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE DAN CARRIED

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:23.909 region:rollup2
FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.411 region:rollup2
MENTIONED A SEVENTY PERCENT A

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:28.080 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE RECEIVING LESS

02:16:25.411 --> 02:16:29.248 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX TODAY THAN THEY

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.115 region:rollup2
WERE PRE GREAT RECESSION.

02:16:29.248 --> 02:16:31.884 region:rollup2
THAT'S PRETTY STARLINGS OVER

02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:33.318 region:rollup2
THREE FOURTHS OF COUNTIES.

02:16:31.884 --> 02:16:34.553 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND PRINCIPLE WE

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:36.188 region:rollup2
WANT TO SPEAK TO IS

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:37.723 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THIS ISN'T

02:16:36.188 --> 02:16:40.092 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY REPORTING TO STATE

02:16:37.723 --> 02:16:40.893 region:rollup2
AGENCIES OR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT

02:16:40.092 --> 02:16:42.428 region:rollup2
BODIES.

02:16:40.893 --> 02:16:44.063 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF

02:16:42.428 --> 02:16:45.664 region:rollup2
LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE

02:16:44.063 --> 02:16:47.232 region:rollup2
INVESTING THOSE RESIDENTS

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:50.502 region:rollup2
DOLLARS INTO PROJECTS AND MAKING

02:16:47.232 --> 02:16:52.237 region:rollup2
SURE. THAT IF A LOCAL AGENCY IS

02:16:50.502 --> 02:16:53.405 region:rollup2
COMMITTING TAX INCREMENT OR IN

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:55.307 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES PERHAPS SALES TAX

02:16:53.405 --> 02:16:56.175 region:rollup2
TOT WHATEVER REVENUES ON THE

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:57.876 region:rollup2
TABLE.

02:16:56.175 --> 02:16:59.711 region:rollup2
THEY OF THE MECHANISMS TO

02:16:57.876 --> 02:17:00.779 region:rollup2
REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THOSE

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:03.615 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS.

02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:03.615 region:rollup2
UNTIL THERE WAS A QUESTION

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:07.386 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT AREAS ARE USING.

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:09.054 region:rollup2
THE NEWER TOOLS YEAH AFTER HE'S

02:17:07.386 --> 02:17:10.722 region:rollup2
CREE AS X. THAT ARE.

02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:12.458 region:rollup2
AND WHY HAVEN'T MORE BEEN USING

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:14.326 region:rollup2
A AND YES I WILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY

02:17:12.458 --> 02:17:15.561 region:rollup2
AGREE THEY'RE VERY NO.

02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:17.129 region:rollup2
SEE SACK HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:18.464 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTIES TO EDUCATE THEM ON

02:17:17.129 --> 02:17:20.432 region:rollup2
WHAT IS AND ISN'T ALLOWABLE

02:17:18.464 --> 02:17:21.934 region:rollup2
PERMISSIBLE. WORKING WITH

02:17:20.432 --> 02:17:24.303 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANTS

02:17:21.934 --> 02:17:25.337 region:rollup2
HOLD WEBINARS AND SHARE WHAT IS

02:17:24.303 --> 02:17:26.872 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY ON THE

02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:30.209 region:rollup2
TABLE FOR COUNTIES.

02:17:26.872 --> 02:17:33.078 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL ALSO AND SAY IN

02:17:30.209 --> 02:17:33.645 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO IT BEING VERY NEW

02:17:33.078 --> 02:17:34.079 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO STILL SOME OF

02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:35.614 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:36.748 region:rollup2
POSTER MATIC STRESS FROM RDA

02:17:35.614 --> 02:17:39.051 region:rollup2
DISSOLUTION.

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:40.018 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA OF TRUST OF WHAT

02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:42.020 region:rollup2
ARE WE GETTING OURSELVES INTO

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:43.722 region:rollup2
HOW LONG EVERY TYING THE HANDS

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:46.191 region:rollup2
OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:47.059 region:rollup2
OF OUR OF OUR COUNTY. ON IN ONE

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:48.560 region:rollup2
OF THESE.

02:17:47.059 --> 02:17:50.229 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.997 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF OTHER COMMUNITY

02:17:50.229 --> 02:17:53.665 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING

02:17:51.997 --> 02:17:54.766 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW COUNTIES

02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:56.168 region:rollup2
ARE COMPETING FOR FUNDING FROM

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:57.569 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:17:56.168 --> 02:17:59.138 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE COMMITTEES PROGRAM.

02:17:57.569 --> 02:18:00.672 region:rollup2
AND STATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES

02:17:59.138 --> 02:18:02.107 region:rollup2
TO PROVOKE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:03.142 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:04.276 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE SUPPORT

02:18:03.142 --> 02:18:06.879 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS

02:18:04.276 --> 02:18:08.080 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW STATE

02:18:06.879 --> 02:18:09.581 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES ARE MASSIVELY

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:12.084 region:rollup2
OVERSUBSCRIBED THIS IS AT THE

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:13.552 region:rollup2
SAME TIME WHEN FEDERAL FUNDING.

02:18:12.084 --> 02:18:14.553 region:rollup2
IS DECREASING TO SUPPORT THESE

02:18:13.552 --> 02:18:16.889 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:18:14.553 --> 02:18:18.791 region:rollup2
AND SO AND RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY

02:18:16.889 --> 02:18:20.459 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN LOCAL SOLUTIONS FOR

02:18:18.791 --> 02:18:21.360 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUNDING TO BE PURSUED BY

02:18:20.459 --> 02:18:24.062 region:rollup2
THE RATS.

02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.665 region:rollup2
OF BONDS OF WHETHER IT'S A.

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:28.267 region:rollup2
PORTION OF LOCAL TO UT I'M

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:30.202 region:rollup2
FINDING OTHER WAYS TO GROW THE

02:18:28.267 --> 02:18:32.838 region:rollup2
PIE SIMPLY THAN PEELING AWAY

02:18:30.202 --> 02:18:35.908 region:rollup2
FROM THE PROPERTY TAX BASE.

02:18:32.838 --> 02:18:37.442 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHILE THESE

02:18:35.908 --> 02:18:38.877 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ARE PROMISING.

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:40.412 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STILL AGAIN THOSE

02:18:38.877 --> 02:18:42.848 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH VOTER THRESHOLDS THAT

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:44.216 region:rollup2
MAKE THEM LESS ATTAINABLE.

02:18:42.848 --> 02:18:46.185 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:18:44.216 --> 02:18:47.986 region:rollup2
THE THE UNFORTUNATE THING HERE

02:18:46.185 --> 02:18:49.288 region:rollup2
TOO IS THAT THE ALTERNATIVE A TO

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:50.389 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE AGAIN RELYING ON

02:18:49.288 --> 02:18:51.690 region:rollup2
PARTY TAX INCREMENT.

02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:53.192 region:rollup2
.

02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:53.892 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY

02:18:53.192 --> 02:18:55.694 region:rollup2
IMPEDE DEVELOPMENT.

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:57.095 region:rollup2
.

02:18:55.694 --> 02:18:58.964 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STUDY FROM THE TURNER

02:18:57.095 --> 02:19:00.699 region:rollup2
CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION.

02:18:58.964 --> 02:19:02.534 region:rollup2
FROM JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR

02:19:00.699 --> 02:19:04.169 region:rollup2
THAT SAID BY REDUCING REVENUES

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:05.604 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FROM POPPY TAXES IT

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.939 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PUT INCREASING PRESSURE

02:19:05.604 --> 02:19:09.308 region:rollup2
ON DEVELOPMENT FEES.

02:19:06.939 --> 02:19:10.142 region:rollup2
AND A CURRENT FINANCING SYSTEM

02:19:09.308 --> 02:19:11.276 region:rollup2
THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON NEW

02:19:10.142 --> 02:19:12.978 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT TO FUND PUBLIC

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:13.979 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE DRIVES UP THE

02:19:12.978 --> 02:19:14.479 region:rollup2
COST OF DEVELOPMENT AND AYE

02:19:13.979 --> 02:19:16.582 region:rollup2
EXACERBATES THE HOUSING

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:19.051 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE.

02:19:16.582 --> 02:19:20.652 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW IN CLOSING I AM I

02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:23.455 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT.

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:25.324 region:rollup2
DIVERTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:26.959 region:rollup2
AS MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS SEEK

02:19:25.324 --> 02:19:28.894 region:rollup2
TO DO AND LUCKILY WITH THE

02:19:26.959 --> 02:19:30.829 region:rollup2
CONSENT OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES.

02:19:28.894 --> 02:19:33.498 region:rollup2
IT MAY HELP HIGHLY LOCALIZED

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:35.100 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BUT WE NEED TOO AT ALL

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:36.635 region:rollup2
COSTS ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:38.937 region:rollup2
PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON

02:19:36.635 --> 02:19:40.372 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.

02:19:38.937 --> 02:19:41.840 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR AGENCIES WERE
