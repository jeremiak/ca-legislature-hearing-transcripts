00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.220
WE ARE WORKING ON TO IMPROVE IT

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:52.456
I THINK AS WE REACHED OUT

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:53.357
THROUGH THE STATE WATER

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:56.159
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- WE DID

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:58.228
NOT RECEIVE A FEEDBACK WE WERE

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:00.430
HOPING FROM THE UTILITIES-

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:02.699
ESPECIALLY WELL WATER

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:03.800
WASTEWATER FACILITIES TO

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:04.935
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:07.804
VULNERABILITIES MAYBE- IN IN

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.706
SOME KEY. AND THIS WAS NOT

NECESSARILY WIDESPREAD THERE

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:14.211
WAS THINK THERE WAS A CONFIDENT.

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:15.879
ONE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY COULD

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.781
MAINTAIN OPERATIONS BUT

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:18.915
CERTAINLY WHAT WE EXPERIENCED

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.684
IN THE LATE OCTOBER THAT'S WAS

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.319
ON THE SCOPE AND SCALE THAT WAS

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:24.821
MUCH GREATER THAN- MANY OF

THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT DEALT

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.325
WITH PREVIOUSLY AND SO WE WANT

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:29.960
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:32.929

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.245
WE ESTIMATED THAT ARE TREATED

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:50.846
WATER STORAGE WOULD LAST ABOUT

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.183
TWENTY FOUR HOURS. MORE

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.018
IMPORTANTLY AND I REALLY CAN'T

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.319
STRESS THIS ENOUGH BUT LIKE

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.320
MOST WATER SYSTEMS IN

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:00.255
CALIFORNIA THE FIRE HYDRANTS IN

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:01.924
COMPARABLE IS ALSO RELY ON THAT

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.459
TREATMENT PLANT AND THAT JUST

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:04.960
THAT SAME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:06.729
FOR WATER PRESSURE. SO WHILE

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:08.130
ARE TREATED WATER STORAGE WOULD

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:09.398
HAVE LASTED ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:10.899
HOURS SIMPLY FOR CONSUMPTIVE

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:13.302
PURPOSES IF A FIRE HAD BROKEN

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:14.203
OUT IN THAT COMMUNITY ON THAT

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.938
DAY. THE FIRE THE WITH THE

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.107
WATER WOULD NOT IT WOULD OUR

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:18.707
TANKS WERE DRAINED MUCH FASTER

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.076
THAN THAT. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:23.379
ALL THERE IS FOR WHAT FOR FIRE

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:24.013
FIGHTING WATER IN THAT

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:26.949
COMMUNITY- THERE'S NO BACK UP

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.350
WATER SUPPLY FOR FIRE HYDRANTS.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.719
AND THIS IS ON A DAY OF COURSE

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.321
THAT P. JEANNIE HAD DETERMINED

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.256
TO BE A RED FLAG WARNING. FOR

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:37.626
SEVERE WILDFIRE RISK. AND THE

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.962
HYDRANTS VERY WELL COULD HAVE

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:40.529
RUN DRY SHOULD HAVE FIRE OF

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.364
OCCURRED. AND THE CONSEQUENCES

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.900
IN CATASTROPHIC WE SOUNDED THE

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:45.834
ALARM TO EVERYONE WHO WOULD

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.404
LISTEN- EARLY THAT AFTERNOON

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.472
CALLOW YES WHO WOULD IT

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.907
CALAVERAS SO YES IS AND CAL

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.776
CALIFORNIA- YES AND SCOURED THE

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.644
STATE FOR GENERATORS INFORMED

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.945
US THAT THEY HAD FOUND A TWO

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.013
MEGAWATT TRAILER MOUNTED

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.482
GENERATOR THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.050
THAT THEY COULD FIND IT WAS

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:02.584
AVAILABLE AND UNFORTUNATELY IT

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:05.087
WAS A TEXT AND- WOULDN'T BE

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.122
HERE IN TIME. OUR NOR RELIABLE

THE ONLY AVAIL AVAILABLE

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.061
GENERATOR THAT THEY COULD FIND

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:13.262
WAS AN EIGHTY TOTAL WATT

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.930
GENERATOR. AND SAN DIEGO WHICH

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.832
WAS NOT NEARLY LARGE ENOUGH OR

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.634
CLOSE ENOUGH. THE AVAILABILITY

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.302
BACKUP GENERATORS IS ONE OF THE

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:21.770
KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN P. S.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.005
P. S. EVENTS AND A TYPICAL

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.107
POWER OUTAGE. IN THE END IT WAS

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.475
P. GINNY THAT EVENTUALLY CAME

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:27.609
THROUGH WE LEARNED THAT

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.744
AFTERNOON THE P. JEANNIE HAD

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.012
CONTRACTED WITH CERTAIN

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.547
GENERATOR VENDORS TO MAKE

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:34.116
BACKUP GENERATORS AVAILABLE. OF

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.084
FOR CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.885

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.754
GINNY DELIVERED A SIX HUNDRED

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.621
KILOWATT GENERATOR THAT NIGHT

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:42.524
AND OUR TREATMENT PLANT BACK ON

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:43.692
LINE AROUND TEN PM. OUR PARENTS

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.094
AND PROP LAST YEAR. WE

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.228
HIGHLIGHTS THE VULNERABLE

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.230
POSITIONS OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.998
WHEN WATER AGENCIES ARE FORCED

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.334
TO OPERATE ON BACKUP GENERATORS

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.335
BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A CASE

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.571
STUDY IN THE LIABILITY SHIFTING

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.005
THAT OCCURS DURING P. S. P.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.241
EVENTS. DID YOU NEED THE OTHER

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:00.709
NOBODY'S IMPLEMENTING P. S. P.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.244
S. IN PART TO REDUCE THEIR

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.012
EXPOSURE FROM LIABILITY TO

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:05.314
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. FOR

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.815
THEIR SHORT SHAREHOLDERS AND

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:07.950
FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE BUT THAT

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.385
LIABILITY DOESN'T DISAPPEAR IT

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.588
SHIFTS THE CHIPS TO. PUBLIC

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.090
AGENCIES IN THIS CASE. AND

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.458
CALVET AND CALIFORNIA WATER

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.360
AGENCIES FACE STRICT LIABILITY

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.829
FOR FIRE DAMAGE THAT OCCURS- IF

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:21.797
THE FIRE SPREADS AS A RESULT OF

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.565
LOS A PRESSURE OF FIRE HYDRANTS

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.534
EVEN IF THE WATER AGENCY WAS AT

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.169
NO FAULT AT ALL. SO IF A FIRE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.071
HAD SPREAD. POPULOUS IN OCTOBER

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.839
TENTH LAST YEAR. THE LIABILITY

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.007
COULD WEAR IT VERY WELL HAVE

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.343
BEEN SEA CWD IN OUR RATE PAYERS

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.779
NOT BE GINNY. WHETHER OR NOT.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.480
SUBJECT WATER AGENCIES DISTRICT

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.716
LIABILITY FOR FIRE DAMAGE. THAT

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.384
IS NOT THEIR FAULT IS A TOPIC

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:43.986
THAT DESERVES ITS OWN SEPARATE

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:44.853
HEARING BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.855
FUTURE I BELIEVE IT'S FAIR

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:47.990
TODAY AND MORE ASSISTANCE. FOR

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:49.424
CRITICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.293
FROM INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.528
THEIR BOTTOM LINE IMPROVES BY

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.396
SHIFTING ABILITY FROM THEM ON

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.565
TO US. AND WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.400
FOR FREQUENT ALONG TO PSP S.

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.202
EVENTS. WE NEED MORE

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.703
GENERATORS. AND WE NEED

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.438
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE

ADDITION TO GENERATORS.

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.979
RESOURCES WE SHOULD EMPLOY THE

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.481
I USED TO FOCUS THEIR

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:13.315
INVESTMENT IN HARDENING THEIR

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:15.651
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE CIRCUITS

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:16.285
THAT SERVE THE CRITICAL PUBLIC

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.720
INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:19.288
HOSPITALS PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:20.889
WATER. FOCUSING EFFORTS ON

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:21.924
THOSE SIR COULD REDUCE THE

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.358
DOWNTIME FOR A CRITICAL PUBLIC

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.427

HELPS BRING IT IN PERSPECTIVE-

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:48.517
WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE IDEA OF

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.220
REQUIRING THE LEAST PAY FOR

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.087
SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE ALL OF

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.155
THESE COSTS IN IT I THINK

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:56.124
YOU'RE THE EP MADE A COM AT THE

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:59.027
STATE HELPING WITH THESE COSTS

IS THAT YOUR HOPE. I'LL AT THE

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.732
STATE WILL HELP MAN. SEE LIKE

NOT I THINK THERE'S A BIRTHDAY

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.639
TO LOOK AT THIS BUT YOU KNOW

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:11.807
ONE POSSIBILITY IS FOR THE I.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.008
O. U. S. TO REIMBURSE THE

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.411
UTILITIES OF OUR UTILITIES FOR

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.112
THE COSTS THAT WE IN HER. AND

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:20.215
THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WITH HE-

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:22.284
IF YOU'RE FACILITIES RUNNING

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.519
LIKE IT'S NORMALLY DO TO RUN.

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:25.721
VERSUS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.556
DIESEL OUR GENERATORS I'M JUST

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:30.192
CURIOUS ABOUT. DO WE HAVE A LOT

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.193
MORE EMISSIONS ARE TALKING

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.461
ABOUT AS WELL AND THERE IS A

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.795
LOT MORE PARTICULAR MATTER

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:34.730
CARBON AND SO FORTH TO THESE

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:37.799
COMMUNITIES. AND DO WE HAVE A

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:41.136
LOT OF RESIDENTS IN THERE SO

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:41.737
FORTH AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:42.938
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED STARK WALL

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:46.475
OVER. TO FIND THE PROBLEM. YOU

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:49.077
KNOW THAT. CRITICAL ISSUE AND

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.579
AN MORE URBAN A BUT IT IT

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.047
CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE FOR US AS

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:54.383
WELL AND NOT JUST THE IMMEDIATE

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:55.817
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS BUT ALSO

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.886
OBVIOUSLY- EMITTING MORE

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:59.021
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:01.056
ANY OF US WOULD LIKE- AND

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:03.692
THAT'S NOT A SITUATION I DON'T

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.394
THINK ANY WATER AGENCY WANTS TO

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.130
BE ME- RUNNING THERE IS OFTEN

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.097
DIESEL DIESEL GENERATORS- BUT

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.700
THERE REALLY IS NO CURRENT THE

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:15.037
ALTAR TO THAT AT THAT THIS TIME

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:19.741
IN AND- YOUR PRE POINT. THANK

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:24.579
EITHER OR BOTH. IT'S ALL. I

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.147
BELIEVE THAT THE I. O. U.'S

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:25.747
SHOULD SHARE THE COST OF THIS

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:28.050
RISK OF THESE IMPACT BUT WHAT

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:29.685
THE STATE MAKING GRANT MONEY

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:30.953
AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR TERM

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.120
WOULD ALSO BE INCREDIBLY

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:34.523
HELPFUL AND ESPECIALLY- MAKING

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:35.490
SURE TO OPEN THAT GRANT THOSE

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.025
GRANT FUNDS UP TO SPECIAL

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.627
DISTRICTS IN ADDITION TO CITIES

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:42.364
AND COUNTIES. AND ONE OTHER

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.732
QUESTION FOR THE EAST BAY SO

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.434
THESE THESE NUMBERS ARE.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.069
HELPFUL TO PURCHASE THESE TWO

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:49.938
INCIDENCES. THEY HAD A HERO. WE

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.440
HAVE A BUT THE MY LOOK LIKE IF

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:52.941
IT AS THE GETS PASSED TO THE

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.376
RATE PAYERS LIKE ARE WE TALKING

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.877
ABOUT A COUPLE DOLLARS FOR EACH

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.379
OF THESE INCIDENTS ARE TALKING

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.849
ABOUT. BUT I CAN SPEAK TO IN

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.150
TERMS OF UP PERCENT RATE

MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.521
OPERATING COSTS REPRESENTS

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:09.057
ABOUT A POINT 3% RATE INCREASE

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.792
FOR OUR WATER CUSTOMERS- ON AN

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:13.929
ANNUAL BASIS. THANK YOU. IF YOU

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.497
DON'T MIND AGAIN A SIMILAR

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.798
LIMITED LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:17.532
ANSWER THAT SAME QUESTION

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.368
BECAUSE FOR MUCH SMALLER THE

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.036
NEWSPAPER BUT OBVIOUSLY- AND

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.171
FOR. US THAT TO OF THE TOTAL

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.773
COST LAST YEAR NOT INCLUDING

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.575
PURCHASING NEW GENERATORS CAME

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:28.210
TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.978
THOUSAND DOLLARS- FOR US OF

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:30.846
WHAT PERCENT INCREASE IT. ON

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.814
WASTE WATER RATES IS ABOUT A

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:34.282
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:34.716
IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:36.752
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR OUR

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:37.786
OPERATING BUDGET THAT THAT WE

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:41.690
ALSO DIDN'T BUDGET FOR. AND

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:45.794
HAVING TO BUDGET FOR THAT GOING

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.229
FORWARD. IS ESSENTIAL. OF THE

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.031
INCREASE WE HAD A SCHEDULED.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:51.833
JUST FORTY. S. THANK YOU. MAY

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.004
YOU. THE QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:56.805
THREE OF IS YOUR ANTI SERVER

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.407
CENTER SERVICE AREAS BY P.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:02.978
JEANNIE WITHIN THE SPACE IN TO.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:06.615
JUST JUSTIN IS BACK. THANK

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:09.951
THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. THIS

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:13.088
IS SO YOU ARE. MOSTLY FROM

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:15.090
WATER DISTRICTS SO OTHER THAN

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:20.262
IS A MUD IS INCLUDING. HOWEVER

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:23.331
ELECTRICITY'S UNDER YOU WILL

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:27.269
JURISDICTION. IT IS SPACE ARE

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:30.372
NOT JUST THE WATER WHY IS SO A

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.641
LUXURY CITY AS WELL. WE OUR

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.109
WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY WE

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:36.578
DO TO GENERATE POWER- ARE UP

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.180
COUNTRY FACILITIES THAT WE SELL

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.948
BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T SELF

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.783
SERVE ANY OF OUR POWER- EXCEPT

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.552
FOR OUR WASTE MARK. CAN SELF

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.720
SERVE SOME POWER. WE DO HAVE

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:48.023
SOME- AFFORDABLE TEXT AT SOME

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:50.425
FACILITIES THAT CAN OFFSET SOME

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.527
OF OUR LOAD- BUT NOT THE LOAD

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:55.564
ENTIRELY. MRS SO YOU COULD WITH

01:18:55.630 --> 01:19:00.035
ENOUGH. I HEARD. THERE IS A

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:04.673
SOME. BUSINESS MODELER A

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.408
COMPANY IS A PROPOSED LETTER

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.976
KNOW WHETHER YOU HEARD ABOUT IT

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:14.549
THE SINCE MANY HOMES ARE ARE

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:19.621
USING SOLAR PANEL. IS SET GROUP

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.990
DISTRICT OR EVEN HOMEOWNERS

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:27.929
ASSOCIATION OR CD COULD.

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:35.003
DEVELOPER A SYSTEM THAT THE-

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:39.574
THEY TIME REGULAR TIME ENERGY

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:42.711
EXCESS ENERGY CAN BE STORED. IN

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:48.116
THE BATTERY. AND THE BATTERY

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:52.954
SYSTEMS OR BE ORDER. CONNECTED

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.824
AND IT BECOMES A SHOE WHICH

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:59.227
ENERGY SOURCE. FOR EMERGENCY

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.898
SITUATIONS HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:06.768
IT WILL IS TO ME THAT IS A

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.203
EXCELLENT IDEA RATHER THAT

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:11.540
USERS. THE BOTTOM PORTABILITY

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:14.876
AND THE LIMITED AND THEN ALSO.

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.811
IN ALMOST WONDERING IN WHAT

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.480
KIND OF A POLLUTION IT IT

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.482
GENERATES- IF FOR SO MANY

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:23.351
GENERATORS SAW. IN A WIN

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:26.254
CALIFORNIA A SO SENSITIVE TO

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:29.491
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SO I THINK

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:34.829
GOOD THIS. IDEA OF A CONNECTING

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:37.098
THE NETWORK OF A STORAGE

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:39.935
ELECTRICITY STORAGES SYSTEMS

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:43.338
THAT THE EACH HOUSE WOULD HAVE

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:44.906
I HAVE A SOLAR SYSTEM BUT I

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.709
DON'T HAVE SOLAR BATTERY. MAY

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:52.347
BE THE STATE. CAN PROVIDE THE

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:55.016
SOME INCENTIVES OF FOUR OR

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.518
HOMES TO HAVE FULL.

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:59.020
ELECTRICITY'S STORAGE BATTERY

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:03.592
SYSTEMS. AND IN EMERGENCY

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:06.828
SITUATION AND THAT PARTICULAR

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:09.231
AREA IF THIS A HOMEOWNERS

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:12.634
ASSOCIATION OR CD OR UTILITY

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.970
DISTRICT. OUT WOULD HAVE WHAT

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.906
ORDER POWELL CONNECTED AND DO

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:19.441
YOU HAVE EXCESS POWER YOU CAN

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.876
USE TO THE FULL WATER PUMPING

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:24.846
ETCETERA YEAH I YEAH I THINK

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.481
THE IDEA OF THE MICROGROOVE

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.282
SOME IT CERTAINLY IS A

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:30.252
POSSIBILITY AND IF AN I OR YOU

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:32.387
CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT A

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:33.855
SOLUTION LIKE THAT- WITH THE WE

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:36.391
ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEM TO DO

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.727
THAT WE DID LOOK AT YOUR

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:42.964
WEATHER OR NOT- ABOUT. HIS

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:45.333
BIGGEST. IS A FEW INCHES WE-

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.769
ARE FIRST WHAT IS VERY HEAVY

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:48.703
OBJECT TO PAY IN PER. EVERY DAY

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.038
BAY MY MOVED ONE POINT THREE

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.641
BILL POUNDS WATER. WE LOOK OUR

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.342
FACILITIES ARE PUMP FACILITIES

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.310
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:56.511
THESE AREN'T VERY LARGE

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.413
FACILITIES SO WHEN WE SCOPED

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.117
OUT ON TV SYSTEM. TV PANELS.

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:04.619
WOULD COVER AN AREA MUCH LARGER

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:05.453
THAN THE PROPERTY THAT WE

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.123
ACTUALLY OWN- IN ADDITION- YOU

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:09.291
HAVE THE BATTERY SO YOU NEED A

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.458
SYSTEM THAT CAN CHARGE THE

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.394
BATTERIES DURING THE DAY. AND

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.863
OPERATE YOUR PUMPS AT NIGHT ON

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.498
THESE PUMPS ARE FAIRLY LARGE TO

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.500
MOVE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN OUR

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.635
SPACE IS LIMITED SO FOR A

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:22.103
UTILITY TO IMPLEMENT PUSH LIKE

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:25.507
THAT- IF EITHER ON JUST NOT

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.375
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.278
THE SPACE- BUT MAYBE YOU TO.

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:31.646
BYE HE JIMMY. THERE ARE MICRO

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.682
GRADES AND SUPPLY MORE RELIABLE

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:35.583
POWER BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.452
WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.821
SPACE- OR THAT AND COSTS ARE

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:44.793
PRETTY HIGH TO IMPLEMENT A- SO.

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:47.262
I THINK COME MY BEST. I'D LIKE

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.296
CAN I CAN I AM TO THAT THAT

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:50.365
WOULD IS A NICE NEW TO ME IS A

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:52.300
VERY LISTENING TO THE I RIGHT

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.370
NOW. THE EMERGENCY SAYS SO YOU

01:22:55.437 --> 01:23:01.409
pSOURCES TWO OF SUPPLY WATER AND

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.378
I THINK ENERGY SOURCE OF WE HAD

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:05.613
TO WE RELY ON THEM WHEN THE

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.951
PIZZA THE GENERATOR'S GO UP

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.553
THIS KIND OF WORK. THE NEW

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.621
SYSTEM MAY IN A CALL THE- AS

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:16.825
SHOWN PANEL NO AS ALMOST ALL OF.

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:19.294
IMAGE MACROS. OR NETWORK SYSTEM

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.563
OR WHATEVER NAME WE CAN COME UP

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:24.265
WITH A IN A I FEEL THAT HAS A

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.900
SOME POTENTIAL TO ME. I'M A

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:28.670
DIRECTLY I'LL JUST ECHO A LOT

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:29.437
OF WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE JUST

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:32.140
MENTION BUT- BY I DO BELIEVE

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:33.241
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS COME A

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:35.977
LONG WAYS- IN RECENT YEARS AS

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:39.180
FAR AS- STORAGE AND THOSE SORTS

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:40.815
OF THINGS BATTERY STORAGE FOR

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:42.684
THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. THE

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.352
POWER REQUIRE IS FOR WATER

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:45.420
WASTEWATER UTILITIES IS

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:47.789
ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS- IN

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.125
COMPARISON. AND JUST TO GIVE

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.394
YOU SOME INSIGHT WE ACTUALLY OF

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.196
THE NWT HOUSE A ONE MEGAWATT

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:58.433
SOLAR. FARM OBVIOUSLY IT

01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.300
DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY ELECTRICITY

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.269
AT NIGHT SO THAT'S A PROBLEM IF

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:03.104
YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A-

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.973
PROLONGED KISS PIASTRE OF AN

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:08.042
OUTAGE FOR. A DAY OR LONGER SO

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:09.778
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC THERE AND

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:12.847
LEADS TO THE NEED FOR YOU KNOW

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.215
A BATTERY BACKUP. THE THIS SO

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:16.151
SOLAR FOR. ENOUGH POWER FOR ONE

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:19.421
POP. ONE STE IT'S A ONE

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:22.223
MEGAWATT TAKES UP FIVE ACRES.

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.159
AND WE HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.161
OF PALM THROUGHOUT A HUNDRED

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.129
TWENTY SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:30.732
SO THE ONLY PRACTICAL BACK UP

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.667
POWER FOR UTILITIES AT THIS

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:37.639
POINT IS DIESEL GENERATION. I'D

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.008
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT IT IS

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.109
MUCH AS WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.343
BROTHER RELIABLE MICHAEL GRADE

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.045
SOLUTION AVAILABLE TO US WAS

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:46.748
CLEANER IT'S THE STATE A

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:48.783
TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW IS SIMPLY

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:49.584
NOT THERE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:51.453
IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE AND THE AND

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:55.023
YOU SIMPLY. ESPECIALLY FOR. AN

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:57.258
ARTS IN OURWE HAVE FACILITIES

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.893
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE THOUSAND

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.896
MILE. SQUARE MILE COUNTY- WITH

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.131
WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.799
COMPARED LIAM RELATIVELY SMALL

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.301
NUMBER OF RATEPAYERS. AND THE

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:07.902
COST OF TRYING TO FIND A MIKE

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.037
GETS SENT TO ALL OF THOSE

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:12.707
FACILITIES- IT JUST IT JUST

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.310
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT PRACTICAL.%

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:18.746
RIGHT PLEASE. SO DURING THE PS

01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:21.115
PS IS ARE YOU FACED WITH FINES

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:23.585
RIGHT NOW AND RUN TIME.

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.554
RESTRICTIONS DOES THAT. ABOUT

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.657
SO L. B. M. W. D. WE HAVE NOT.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.025
BEEN SUBJECT TO ANY FINES

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:34.028
FORTUNATELY WE'VE COME CLOSE.

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:36.231
THE TO SPEAK TO THE RUN TIME

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:38.466
RESTRICTIONS- OLDER GENERATORS

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.235
TO DEPENDS ON THE SIZE AND HOW

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:41.636
OLD THE GENERATOR IS AND WHAT

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:44.339
CLASS RAN. WE HAVE A TWENTY

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.041
HOUR PER YEAR MAXIMUM RUNTIME

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:49.177
FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES JUST

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.812
TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA BE

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:51.579
OPERATIONAL WHEN THERE IS AN

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.015
EMERGENCY. SO WE'VE MANAGED TO

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.383
AVOID FINES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:57.752
THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED LONGER

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.621
RUN TIME FOR TESTING AND

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.322
MAINTENANCE AND THAT'S PART OF

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.157
OUR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. AS

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:05.527
FAR AS ACTUAL EMERGENCY WILL

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:10.765
SEE WE IN OUR SITUATION THE ONE

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.934
LOOK THE ONE FACILITY THAT. WE

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:15.904
LOST POWER FROM LIKE RED FOR A

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:18.540
PROLONGED PERIOD TIME. A IN HIS

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.942
OLDER GENERATORS THERE'S A TWO

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:24.045
HUNDRED HOUR MAX RUNTIME CáC.

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.380
THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.382
FORTUNATELY WE GOT A MOBILE

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:29.551
GENERATOR THAT WAS. PERMITTED

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:32.554
THROUGH- AT THE STATE LEVEL SO

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.188
NOT THROUGH THE LOCAL REGIONAL

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:35.990
AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARD DOWN

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:39.594
SOUTH- BUT SO FORTUNATELY WERE

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.229
ABLE TO GET A GENERATOR RUN THE

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:43.131
FACILITY THAT TILL HE WAS DOWN

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:44.832
SIX. WHICH FAR AS TO HUNDRED

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:46.568
HOURS. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:47.769
TO KEEP IN MIND THERE IS A LOT

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.437
OF COMPLICATIONS WITH. WITH

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:54.008
THESE GENERATORS AND JUST SOME

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:54.609
OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:57.579
FACED WITH. Q. I DO HAVE A

01:26:57.645 --> 01:26:59.213
COUPLE QUESTIONS IN ALL START

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.783
WITH THE MICHAEL OF KIND OF

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.618
WITH A CONTRAST TO THE

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:05.119
CHALLENGES THAT MAY BE THE

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.655
BIGGER URBAN AREAS HAVE VERSUS

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.424
SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.925
CAN YOU MAYBE HIGHLIGHTS SOME

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:13.995
OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT YOU

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:14.596
SEE BEFORE YOU THAT ARE A BIT

01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:17.865
DIFFERENT. HI THE BROKEN UNITY

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.767
CHALLENGES AGAINST AND YOU

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.169
MENTIONED SOME OF COSTS RIGHT

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.770
AND- BEING ABLE TO KIND OF

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.039
SPREAD THAT DROP OUT BUT- ARE

01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:27.075
THERE ANY OTHER. AREAS A YUBA

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:28.209
COULD POTENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:30.011
THAT WOULD REFLECT OTHER WATER

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:32.013
AGENCIES AND FIND THEMSELVES IN

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.848
MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.450
IT COST IS DEFINITELY A BIG

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.852
ONE- ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE I AT

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.220
A LOT OF THE EXAMPLES THAT MY

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.422
COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED SOUND

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:42.557
VERY FAMILIAR TO ME WE'VE WE'VE

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.726
WE'VE HAD ALSO. HOW WE MAINTAIN

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:47.128
AND OPERATE. OUR GENERATOR- A

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:49.397
LOT OF THE SAME EXPERIENCES- I

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.832
WOULD SAY THE OTHER CHALLENGE

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:54.469
FOR US STAFFING WE HAVEN'T.

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.504
COMPLY OUR OUR FULL TIME STAFF

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.040
IS SIXTY SIX EMPLOYEES. ABOUT

01:27:59.107 --> 01:27:59.540
FORTY FIVE OF THOSE ARE

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:03.778
OPERATIONAL- AND THE EFFORT

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.180
THAT WOULD STICK BALL CAN KEEP

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:08.583
ALL OF OUR GENERATORS FUELED.

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:09.717
PUMPING NOW ALL OF OUR WASTE

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:13.521
WATER. IT PUTS AN INCREASE. IN

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:15.023
ON A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF YOUR

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:15.957
MAKE AND ELECT. AND THAT WE

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.959
HAVE AND SO THEY ENDED UP

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.094
WORKING EXTREMELY LONG DAYS-

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.096
DURING THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.898
AND SO NOT ONLY THE OVERTIME

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.367
COSTS TO THE DISTRICT- BUT IT

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:27.635
AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU START TO

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:30.104
WORRY ABOUT SAFETY. AND THE

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.906
IMPACT ON YOUR CRUISE. IT EAST

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.941
BAY THE MEAN. UTILITIES ANY ERA

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.777
OTHER IT. LONG TERM INVESTMENTS

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:37.178
THAT- THE AGENCY HAS BEEN

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.947
MAKING ARE. PROJECTING TO MAKE.

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:43.618
RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND.

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:44.719
YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:45.887
WORTH CERTAINLY LOOK AT ALL OUR

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.321
PUMP STATIONS WE DO HAVE

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.023
PERMANENT BACKUP POWER AT ALL

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.358
OF OUR TREATMENT PLANTS IN OUR

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:52.527
MAJOR PUMPING PLANTS- AND YOUR

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:54.696
WE DIDN'T KNOW GOING INTO THE

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.297
TWENTY THAT LAST YEAR'S YES PS

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:59.701
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PEACE IN A-

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:00.168
DID A LOT ANALYSIS TO

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:01.069
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IN. WOULD

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.704
BE POWER OUTAGES AND I THINK

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.005
IT'S CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTED

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:05.006
CERTAIN FACILITIES THAT WE

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.974
MIGHT WANT TO INSTALL PERMANENT

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.643
BACKUP POWER OUT- BUT WE STILL

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.411
BELIEVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IT'S

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.979
ALL JUST BETWEEN THE OCTOBER

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:16.317
NINTH IN THE OCTOBER TWENTY.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:17.385
THE CONDITIONS CAN CHANGE QUICK.

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:18.386
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:19.520
BE VERY NIMBLE AND MOVE

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:21.656
EQUIPMENT AROUND- THE RISK OF

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.524
INSTALLING PERMANENT. PORTABLE

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:24.525
POWER IS THAT WE CAN'T MOVE

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:25.960
PERMANENT PARTIAL POWER.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.029
PERMITTED POWER AROUND SO WE DO

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:29.931
NEED THAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.232
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:36.404
WERE WILL PROBABLY INVEST.

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:38.072
PERMANENT POWER. QUESTION FOR

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.241
ANY AND ALL. OF THE SOME OF

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:41.342
THESE ON THE PREVENTIVA SIDE

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:43.911
FROM STATE ARE THERE SPECIFIC

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:46.714
UP PROGRAMS POTS OF MONEY THAT

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:48.216
YOU LOOKED AT IN OF SOUL WHAT

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:51.686
ARE THE- DIFFICULT TO ACCESS

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.788
AND THAT WOULD CARRY WE WERE

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.823
TALKING ABOUT MORE RESOURCES

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:58.059
ACROSS THE BALLROOM HAVE THIS

01:29:58.126 --> 01:29:58.793
CONVERSATION BUT- CIVIC

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.128
PROGRAMS ALREADY. OUT THERE

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:02.130
THAT THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT A

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:04.732
TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.701
ENHANCING THOSE- BUDGETARY.

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:09.237
LINE ITEMS OR ARE THERE

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.706
CHALLENGES EVEN FOR THAT MATTER

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:12.206
ACCESSING THOSE PROGRAMS

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.142
WHETHER BE A SMALLER ROLE. FOR

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.310
THAT MATTER. SOME OF THE MORE

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.079
URBANIZED THAT WATER AGENCIES.

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:20.548
THE ONE THAT COMES AMONG THE IS

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.350
IT. THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.451
DOLLARS AT THE GOVERNOR'S BALL.

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:26.587
INCLUDED LAST YEAR- FOR PS PS

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.256
RESPONSE WITH LIMITED TO CITIES

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:32.360
AND COUNTIES- TO DISTRICTS NOT

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.394
ABLE TO LIVE FOR THAT MAY OKAY.

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:36.497
THIS UNDER IS. THAT THEY HAVE

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.098
BEEN A GOV PROPOSED BUDGET IN

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:41.936
ITS WITH A FIFTY NINE DOLLARS

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:52.880
FOR P. PS. OPEN SPECIAL. IN

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:56.050
THAT SAME- PART OF MONEY SO- IN

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.652
MY OPINION I THINK FIFTY

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.786
MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO GO

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:02.089
VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THAT. I

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:05.293
THINK IT WOULD BE. A GOOD- USE

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.928
OF RESOURCES TO INCREASE THAT

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:09.730
THAT. IN THE BUDGET WHO KNOWS.

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.599
THAT WELL I'M I'M AWARE SOME

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.834
FUNNY AND GRANT FUNDING THROUGH

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.769
FEMA- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.771
THE STATE LEVEL SO WE'VE WE'VE

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:18.272
BEEN SEEKING OUT SOME OF THAT

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:19.807
WE ARE ACTUALLY INSTALLING

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.375
SEVERAL FIX EMERGENCY

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:23.644
GENERATORS THAT ARE MORE

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.246
CRITICAL FACILITIES AND- WE ARE

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:28.783
ACTUALLY BANG OR TOLL REFORM.

IT GAVE MEGAWATT SOME ANOTHER

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:33.087
TWENTY. BUT AGAIN THAT THAT HAS

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:35.656
LIMITATIONS. YEAH I WOULD JUST

DEVASTATED PART OF THE AREA AND

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:52.993
THEN THE WATER SYSTEMS NEAR

LAYERED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:11.912
THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:14.081
DIFFERENT THIS IS ACTUALLY WAS

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.916

LOOKING AT THIS PARTICULAR MAP

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.736
THE CENTER PORTION IS

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.671
UNFORTUNATELY PARADISE. ALL

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.873
BURNED OUT BUT TO THE LEFT IS

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.176
CHICO AND SO YOU CAN TELL THAT

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:44.478
MAYBE AND NEXT CONCERN ON THIS

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:46.580
MIGHT BE THE CHICO SO. THOSE

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.449
ARE BOTH A TOOLS THAT ARE

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:51.952
AVAILABLE WITH THAT WATER SAFE.

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:53.520
SAFETY SECTOR POSITION. IN

YOU NEED TO WATER AGENCIES AND

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.811
THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:19.312
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THIS YEAR

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:20.414
TO LOOK AT THE IMPROVEMENTS

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.815
THAT ARE NEEDED ON THE ELECTRIC

APPROPRIATE WILL WAIT. ON THAT.

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.220
AND ONE OTHER PIECE THAT WAS.

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:29.356
BY THE LAST PANEL IS THE STRESS

WATER AGENCIES RAN INTO ISSUES

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:41.802
WHERE THEY COULDN'T COMMUNICATE

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:43.203
BECAUSE THEY'RE RLIANT UPON

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.670
NETWORKS THAT WEREN'T

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:45.505

ALSO BEING PROACTIVE HOWEVER

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:50.110
OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATORS FEAR

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.378
NOT ALL OF THESE TO BE SOLVED

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:55.115

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:25.038
MORE SPECIFIC IF POSSIBLE ON

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.973
SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.542
TERMS OF SOME OF THE FUNDING

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:30.577
BACKS A LEXUS IN THE SIDE FROM

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:32.813
THE AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE YES

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:36.817
I THINK SO- SO WE WERE AT

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:37.851
ACCESS TO THE FUNDING THAT WAS

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.586
IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR'S

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:42.422
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A CHALLENGE I

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:47.027
THINK. THE RECORD AND THIS YEAR.

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:49.896
CONVERSATIONS AS A PRO. AND

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:50.530
OTHER FUNDING THE ALREADY SORT

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:51.565
OF OUT THERE AVAILABLE THE WHAT

01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:52.432
REVOLVING FUNDS THAT I MENTION

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:54.501
I THINK. WITH THEIR VENDORS

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:55.268
WITH THOUGH WHY RESOURCES BOARD

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:56.670
THIS FUND WOULD BE AVAILABLE

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.971
FOR THAT I THINK THAT THAT

01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:59.206
FUNDING IS ALSO INTENDED FOR A

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:00.707
MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS. SO

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:01.975
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:03.643
COMPETING INTERESTS FOR US YOU

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.045
KNOW AS A CERTAIN PART OF

01:48:05.111 --> 01:48:06.847
MONEY. AND THAT FLOWS THROUGH

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:08.615
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:10.317
STATE TO ADMINISTER SO I THINK.

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:12.152
THERE ARE FUNDING STREAMS. BULL

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:14.688
BUT- THERE'S THOSE ARE ALREADY

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:17.457
CUT MARCH FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:20.227
TWELVE. THERE'S JUST LOOK COME

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:21.628
TO MODIFY WHICH THE START OF

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:25.999
PUBLIC AGENCIES AND GENERAL.

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:28.535
OKAY REGARDING REGIONAL LOOK

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:30.871
WORK AT COORDINATION WHAT'S

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:33.306
THAT LOOK FROM REGION TO REGION

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.308
SEVERAL BASS THEY TRY TO BE THE

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:37.377
THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIVIDED WITH

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:39.246
THE FIVE REGIONS AND THROUGHOUT

01:48:39.312 --> 01:48:41.882
THE STATE- THEY TRY TO FIRST

01:48:41.948 --> 01:48:44.885
LOOK. AT THE PART OF THE STATE

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.987
MEDIA YOU KIND OF COLLECTIVELY

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.855
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.056
WE HAVE THAT TYPE THE METHODS

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:52.259
THROUGH MY SO THERE'S SOME OF

01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:56.029
THAT AGENCIES ASSISTANCE UP

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:58.965
THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE IS BASED

01:48:59.032 --> 01:49:04.771
THAT I YEAH YEAH SHOP TO THE-

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.006
FOR. THE NEXT NEED THEM THE

01:49:06.072 --> 01:49:09.609
OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL I.

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:10.210
SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP QUITE

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:11.878
A IS THE ISSUE JENNA. YES AND

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.546
DOM WATER AGENTS LOOKING AT

01:49:13.613 --> 01:49:16.750
OTHER. ALTERNATIVES TO

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:19.052
GENERATORS IN OF SO WHERE THEY

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:22.789
LOOK LIKE AND- MAYBE IDEA OF

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:27.494
COST COMPARISONS- SO WE THE

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.229
CITY OF SACRAMENTO IS BAD HAS

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:30.463
MOST OF THEIR PART POWER BASED

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:34.034
ON SPOTTED. A WE ARE USUALLY A

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.702
ONE YEAR OLD USUALLY THE ONE

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:38.204
THAT THEY REACH OUT TO FORTY

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:41.007
READY YET AS FAR AS A DIFFERENT

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:44.377
SORT FOR ALTERNATIVES. I CAN

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:49.282
GET NOW I'M NOT SURE. IT WHAT

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:50.450
ARE YOU SEE YES SO FROM LAST

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:53.320
THE RIGHT. ABOUT IT PROBLEM AND

01:49:53.386 --> 01:49:54.487
SO. FOR AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:55.655
CAN BE PRETTY AND PUT IN PLACE

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:57.057
I THINK SOME OF THEM TOUCH ON

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:57.824
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE

01:49:57.891 --> 01:49:59.192
TECHNOLOGY STILL ISN'T QUITE

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:01.895
THERE- AND I THINK. YOU'RE

01:50:01.962 --> 01:50:03.797
DOING IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.131
SOME ESPECIALLY SOME OF THESE

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:06.099
ARE AGENCIES AND OVER A HUNDRED

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:08.034
YLIDES W. FOR DIFFERENT

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:10.036
MICROGRAMS THAT YOU NEED TO

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.671
INVEST IN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:14.240
THE KIND OF IT THAT WOULD NEED

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:16.076
TO GO INTO. THE THING THAT WE

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:19.312
NEED TO GO. SB BACK. LONG

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:20.447
HAITIAN TO GET THAT IN

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:21.614
POTENTIAL I'M A LOT OF ROOM

01:50:21.681 --> 01:50:22.949
HAVE ANGRY AS INVEST IN A LOT

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:26.252
OF TECH I WILL SAY THAT I. THE

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:27.821
MINDSET THAT THEY NEEDTO BE

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:28.888
THEIR OWN ALL BURKE PROVIDER

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.156
WAS NOT REALLY PART OF THAT

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:31.825
DISCUSSION AT THE TIME IT WAS

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:33.927
MORE ABOUT- SELLING BACK TO THE

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.762
GRANTED OVER CUTTING COSTS AT

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:38.098
PEAK TIMES. AND SO ALMOST ALL

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:40.033
OF THE MEMBERS AWARE OF THE

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.301
HAVE INVESTED IN THESE KINDS OF

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:43.403
YOU KNOW EITHER STROLLER OR

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:45.772
BATTERY OR- COMBINATION. IT'S

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:46.673
NOT SET UP TO BE BEHIND THE EAR

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:48.174
OR ISLAND IT. SO DURING THESE

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:50.210
POWER OUTAGES THEY ACTUALLY

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:50.977
DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAT

01:50:51.044 --> 01:50:54.881
ELECTRICITY AND NOT BACK UP. SO

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:59.152
IS THE POTENTIAL TO CONVERT

01:50:59.219 --> 01:50:59.686
SOME OF THAT AND MAYBE AT

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.721
CERTAIN VESSEL. PROBE BUT I

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:04.391
THINK THAT FOR THE- PART- THAT

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:05.825
THAT GENERATED REALLY THE BEST

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:11.264
SOLUTION. BASED SO DO YOU HAVE

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.199
ANY IDEA WHAT KIND OF A

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:14.567
INVESTMENT YOU WOULD NEED AS

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.736
FAR I MEAN I KNOW FOR A MILLION

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:19.506
DOLLARS. LIKE A LOT OF. IN

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:20.774
REALITY IT'S NOT DO YOU HAVE

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:24.044
ANY IDEA WHAT. THE NEED IS- I

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:25.178
THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:26.646
WORK WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP TO GET

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:29.082
A BETTER SENSE OF EXACTLY WHAT

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:31.184
THEY NEED IS I THINK THE OTHER

01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:31.684
THING ABOUT AT LEAST AS

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:32.252
POSSIBLE OUT OF MONEY. THAT

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:32.886
CITIES AND COUNTIES AND OTHERS

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:35.388
BUT- ALSO PROBABLY HAVE THAT.

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:36.022
NEEDS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:37.657
WORKING ON. AND JUST TO GIVE

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.492
YOU A SENSE MOST OF THESE

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:40.794
ESPECIALLY LARGER GENERATORS

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.896
ARE CUSTOM BUILT. AT THEIR

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.998
ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:45.598
THOUSAND TO OVER IN THE-

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:48.101
GREATER- AND THEY TAKE.

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:49.803
PROBABLY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR

01:51:49.869 --> 01:51:50.570
TO ACTUALLY HAVE DESIGNED AND

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.439
BUILT OUT. SO I THINK WE

01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:54.140
PROBABLY DO NEED SOME BETTER

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.042
NUMBERS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:51:56.109 --> 01:52:00.914
NEED IS. BUT IN FIFTY IN. A LOT

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:03.116
LESS. BAR THAT ONE TAKE THAT I

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:05.885
MIGHT. SO HAVE WHAT WHAT RETAIN

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:09.322

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.571
CAPACITY AND SO IT DEPENDS

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:29.342
INDIVIDUAL THE TRYING ON WITH.

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:30.844
FOR A TREATMENT PLANT WENT

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:33.480
