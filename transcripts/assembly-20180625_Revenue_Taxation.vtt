ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY WE DO

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:39.071
HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE WE

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:41.073
DO UNDERSTAND THE CREATIVITY AND

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:43.041
THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO USE

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:45.010
IN ORDER TO TRY TO PROTECT

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.111
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.879
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO BELIEVE THAT

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.047
THIS PROTECTION WOULD COME AT

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:51.450
THE COST OF EDUCATIONAL FUNDING.

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:53.885
AND WE HAVE BEGUN TAKING A VERY

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.354
DEEP LOOK AT THIS AS WELL AS A

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.521
NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES AND

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:57.990
UNFORTUNATELY THIS COULD HAVE A

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:59.691
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

OUT WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:06.131
IN YOUR WERE BEGINNING TO HAVE

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.466
AS A POSITIVE TREND MOVING

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.401
FORWARD IN EDUCATION FUNDING

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.135
THAT WHILE WE'RE GETTING MORE

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:11.470
FUNDING FOR EDUCATION IN THE

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:12.404
BUDGET.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.972
MEASURES SUCH AS THIS COULD NOT

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.741
ONLY ON DO ALL THE SIGNIFICANT

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.609
THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:18.977
EDUCATION FUNDING BUT COULD

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.712
ACTUALLY DECIMATED AND A MUCH

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.414
GRANDER LEVEL SO WE DON'T

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:23.548
SUPPORT THE MEASURE MOVING

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.550
FORWARD WHILE WE DO APPRECIATE

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.119
THE ATTEMPT IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.286
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:30.155
THAT IS ONLY GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.124
ON IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.392
FUTURE TAXPAYERS IF IT'S AT THE

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.526
COST OF OUR CHILDREN'S

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.629
EDUCATIONAL FUTURE WE WOULD

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.564
ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE AT THIS TIME.

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:40.866
THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:43.135

SEEING NONE COMMENTS QUESTIONS

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.571
FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible]

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:49.341
MR MATHIS.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.443
SENATOR YOU SAID EARLIER TAKING

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.878
THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.079
COMMITTEE --

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.048
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ARE YOU

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:58.016
WILLING TO TAKE A AN AMENDMENT.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.351
THAT IS GOING TO FOR TAX CUTS

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.920
CALIFORNIANS FROM THE IRS IF

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.088
THEY COME BACK AND ROLL

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:03.388
[inaudible]

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.957
AGAINST THIS.

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:07.392
IF IF I KNOW IT'S BEEN PART OF

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.493
THE DEBATE ARMS LIKE OR ARE YOU

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.294
ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THAT

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.163
AMENDMENT TO PROTECT THEM IN

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:12.597
CASE IT COMES BACK.

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:13.498
BECAUSE I MEAN I I THINK THE

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.299
LAST THING ANY OF US WANT TO SEE

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:14.633
IS PEOPLE GET.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.069
PENALIZED. FOR SOMETHING AND I

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:17.869
KNOW THEY'RE WORKING ON THIS

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.838
RIGHT NOW SO MY CONCERN IS THAT

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.606
IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE --

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.775
AND THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.712
AND TELL THEIR IRIS RULINGS DON --

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:28.447
VERSES ROLLING THIS OUT NOW BUT

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.981
IF YOU TOOK AN AMENDMENT TO

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.216
PROTECT THEM.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.184
YOU KNOW A AGAINST THE NEGATIVE

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.618
RULING.

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:34.619
THEN THAT I'D BE WILLING TO

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.555
SUPPORT IT BUT MY CONCERN IS

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:37.889
THAT IF IT COMES AYE NEGATIVELY

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.224
THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:40.525
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR TAXPAYERS

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.227
INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HELPING THEM.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.162
INTERNAL ORGAN HARM THEM

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:45.030
ACTUALLY LIVE WITH I COULDN'T

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:46.064
ACTUALLY FLIP IT AROUND I THINK

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:46.932
RIGHT NOW.

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.500
YOU CAN TRY THERE'S HARM BEING

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.603
DONE TO THE TAXPAYERS WHY NOW IF

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.371

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:55.407

IF THERE IS NO ONE IS MEASURED

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:59.177
THERE'S A VOTE. TO TAX THREE

SOLUTION DOESN'T DO ANY HARM TO

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.647

TOUCH THAT PROPOSITION NIKE

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:29.895
BUT LET ME SAY THE FOLLOWING IS

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.897

ESTABLISHED BY MY FORMER

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.513
COLLEAGUE FROM COULD CHALLENGE

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:06.314
LEGISLATION TWENTY THIRTEEN IN

THIS NEW LEGISLATION JUST TORN

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.750
UNDERSTAND.

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:10.352
WOULD YOU HAVE ALMOST DONE.

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.087
IDENTICAL OVERLAP WITH THE

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.990
AGENCIES IN DOING THIS ARE I

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:15.957
THINK THIS ISSUE IS

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.025
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT I

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.093
DON'T I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:18.960
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.262
SHOULD BE TACKLING.

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:24.166
BUT ON NOT REALLY SURE WHY.

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.967
THIS NEW APPROACH.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.904
VERSUS THE OLD APPROACH.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:29.738
THE SAME AGENCIES JUST IT JUST

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.807
SEEMS LIKE.

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:32.641
YOU KNOW WE JUST CHANGE

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.409

ANY DIFFERENT RESULTS ATTRACTED

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.446
A BETTER STATE OF WHAT'S BEEN

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.013
DONE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE IN

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:38.313
[inaudible]

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.915
WHY WE?

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.049
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.885
CHANGE.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:44.953
BUT CIVIC EXCEPT FOR THE ONE

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.023

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:51.693
I'M WHEN I STARTED WITH THIS

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.862
BILL THE IDEA WAS TO EXPAND

BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY IT HAD BEEN

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:56.598
FOR SACRAMENTO.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.066
AND LOS ANGELES SO WE WANTED TO

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.868
MAKE A PERMANENT AND WE WANTED

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.336
TO EXPAND IT TO FRESNO AND THE

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.304
BAY AREA.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:05.640
AND SAN DIEGO AND WE PARTNERED

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:08.009
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.978

THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.385
SUBSEQUENTLY THE TRACE PROGRAM

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:20.755
WAS ESTABLISHED --

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:21.857
TO ESSENTIALLY --

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:22.991
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.259
INFORMATION SHARING THAT WAS

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.861
AUTHORIZED BY RACE BUT BRINGING

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:28.230
THE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.598

SUNSETS.

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:47.816
I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE TRACE

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.918
REALLY PROVED TO BE AN EFFECTIVE

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:52.554

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:08.103
[inaudible]

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.373
AND WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IT

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.674
CONTINUE --

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.843
IT'S BROUGHT UP FOURTEEN MILLION

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.878
DOLLARS IN USING EXISTING

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.880

AND WE THINK THAT BY --

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.791
STRENGTHENING THE TEAMS IN

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.726

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.461
EXPANDING TO THE OTHER MAJOR

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:34.362

AND SHOULD CONTINUE AND IN FACT

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.816
THEIR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT IT

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:49.738
ODD.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.106
THAT THE TRACE WOULD BE

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.173
RECOMMENDED SINCE IT WAS ONLY

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.177

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:31.946

GONNA DIFFER BY REGION --

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.667
BAY AREA CERTAINLY GONNA HAVE

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.636
DIFFERENT FACTORS AND AND CRIMES

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:57.906
I THINK.

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:58.707
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.375
SACRAMENTO IN LA TEAMS DIDN'T

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.544
COVER THE ENTIRE STATE THEY DID.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:03.878
ON THEY WERE JUST KIND OF SPREAD

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:06.247
THEN US.

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.982
HAVING HEADQUARTERS IN THOSE

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:08.850

MAIL CENTER --

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.227
THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT THAN

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:20.729
WHAT YOU GET IN FRESNO AND SO

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.497
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROGRAM

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.465
THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:28.870
TAILOR ITSELF. TO THE REGION AND

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.672
AND REALLY ACT AS A DETERRENT

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:31.639
FOR SOME OF THE BIG MAJOR

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:32.540
UNDERGROUND ECONOMIC CRIMES IN

THAT AREA.

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.312

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.747
MUCH APPRECIATE --

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.048
SENEGAL JOHNNY FOR BRINGING THIS

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.183
BILL FORWARD ALL WANT ONE OF MY

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.287
CONCERNS WITH THE TRACE PROGRAM

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.022
AS IT WAS --

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.524
MOVING FORWARD WAS THAT IT WAS

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.192
ACTUALLY IN COMPETITION WITH THE

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.627
LEGISLATURE'S PROGRAM WHICH WAS

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:53.862
RACE.

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:54.829
IT'S ON GLAD THAT YOU'RE

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:55.697
ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.899
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO IT TO GET

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.701
A CODIFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.870
THAT WAS ON WITH SOME OF THE

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.339
TENSION THAT WAS GOING ON SO.

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:04.973
MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT WOULD

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:10.044
BE ON GOOD TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.446
THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.348
INTERFACE WITH THE AGENCIES THAT

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.250
WERE PART OF RACE AND HOW THAT.

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.619
ON HOW HOW ARE REALLY IS MORE OF

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.621
A COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM THAT

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.489
REALLY WASN'T MY IMPRESSION.

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.024
LA I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.593
BUDGET REQUEST THIS YEAR.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.128
THAT I DIDN'T GET FUNDED BECAUSE

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.196
OF I BELIEVE SOME OF THE

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.731
CONCERNS REGARDING HOW

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.399
COLLABORATIVE THIS PROGRAM IS IT

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.034
IS CONCERNING THAT MYSTERIES

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.702
HERE FROM CH P. AND THAT.

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:37.305
ON THE HOPE IS THAT THE THE

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:38.606
PROGRAM LEARNS FROM SOME OF THE

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:40.275
HISTORYLARA'S TO WORK WITH A

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:42.977
WIDE VARIETY OF AGENCIES ACROSS

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.112
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.713
THAT THIS IS TOLD THAT NOTHING

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.783
TO DO WITH AN UGLY THE SENATORS --

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:49.551
LEGISLATURE SOLUTION BUT I

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:50.952
BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAD

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:51.653
INTENTION.

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.421
WESTERN AGENCIES TO BE WORKED

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:54.522
WITH -- I

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.291
HOPE THAT THAT INTENTION WILL BE

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.259
RESPECTED MOVING FORWARD EVEN

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:59.527
THOUGH THE PROGRAM SUNSETS.

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.563

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.399

AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR COST

IF WE HAVE A MODEL LANGUAGE.

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:37.625

COMPLIANCE BURDEN AND ACTUALLY

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.329

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.166
