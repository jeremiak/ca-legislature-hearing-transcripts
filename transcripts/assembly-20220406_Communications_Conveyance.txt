TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A DIGITAL EQUITY BILL OF RIGHTS WOULD MAKE. MAKE IT A POP THE POLICY THE STATE FOR BROADBAND TO BE SUFFICIENT RELIABLE AFFORDABLE AND UBIQUITOUS EVERYWHERE. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ADOPT RULES THAT FACILITATE EQUAL ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE. CUPBOARD NINETEEN HIGHLIGHTED HOW WIDE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS IN CALIFORNIA HOW CRUCIAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BECOME TO MODERN LIFE. CLICK AGENCIES AND SERVICES REQUIRED A STRONG INTERNET CONNECTION TO ACCESS THEM. WE SAW WORKING FAMILIES. STRUGGLE IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES WITH HAVING THEIR CHILDREN LEARN FROM ZOOM BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE INTERNET SERVICE. IT IS CLEAR THAT ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS BECOMING A NECESSITY IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE WILL MAKE BROADBAND MORE AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE BY FIRST ESTABLISHING THE POLICY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE DIGITAL EQUITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. SECOND TO DECLARE THAT ALL RESIDENTS OF THE STATE HAVE A RIGHT TO BROADBAND THAT IS SUFFICIENT RELIABLE AFFORDABLE AND UBIQUITOUS. AND THIRD REQUIRING THE CPUC TO ADOPT RULES TO FACILITATE EQUAL ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND INTERNET SERVICE AND ACCOUNT FOR TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY PRESENTED PRESENTED BY EQUAL ACCESS. IT IS CLEAR THE BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES ARE THE DEFINING TRAIT OF THE DIGITAL AGE WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THE STATE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT BEYOND THESE INVESTMENTS CALIFORNIANS DO HAVE RELIABLE. IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CIVIL RIGHT AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE SENATOR RICHARD POLANCO WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FUND AND JAN GOING ONTO STUDENT TRUSTEE FOR THE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. WELCOME MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU- I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FUND AS WELL AS THE DIGITAL EQUITY COALITION WE ARE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE A BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FUND IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION. IT IS DEDICATED TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN OUR RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE- THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THAT THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO BROADBAND IN VARIOUS FORMS. AND FUNCTIONS AND TO ENSURE DIGITAL EQUITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. THE ANALYSIS- BY COMMITTEE STAFF POINTS OUT THAT THE FCC WILL ADOPT THEIR RULES ON HOW TO PREVENT AND ELIMINATE DIGITAL DISCRIMINATION. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET WE APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS HOWEVER THESE RULES AT THE FCC C. CAN BE CHANGED WHEN A NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS ESTABLISHED. AND THEREFORE THIS BILL BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIANS THE MEASURE WILL ENSURE. THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PROVIDED EXTRA PROTECTION BY REQUIRING THE P. YOU SEE. TO REVISE ITS COMPLAINT PROCESSRELATING TO. DIGITAL DISCRIMINATION. IT WILL REQUIRE THE CPUC TO ADOPT RULES THAT WILL PROMOTE EQUAL ACCESS TO ROBUST. BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE BY PROHIBITING DEPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THIS BODY HAS A HISTORY OF STEPPING UP TO ENSURE THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIANS THEY DID IT WITH THE JESS UNRUH ACT THEY'VE DONE IT WITH THE RALPH. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE RECENTLY DID WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THIS PARTICULAR PANDEMIC ILLUMINATED. THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BOTH IN RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH I LIVE. APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT THREE MILLION. L. A. COUNTY RESIDENTS CAN ONLY ACCESS. USING SMARTPHONES ONE POINT TWO MILLION UP L. A. COUNTY RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE ANY WAY TO ACCESS THE INTERNET ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE BERKELEY INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENT STUDIES. BANISHED THE ASSEMBLY WEB BASED US OF A THE AUTHOR. STATES BROADBAND IS THE IS ESSENTIAL FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS DIGITAL EQUITY IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ISSUE ON BEHALF OF THE EMERGING ECHNOLOGY FUND THE FORTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PETITION SIGNERS WHO WHOEVER ASKS THAT YOU CONTINUE THE LEGACY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY CENTER FOR ONE GIRL GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS JUNGLE NOT I'LL EVEN THAT MY TITLE WAS STATED EARLIER TODAY I'M COMING TO YOU AS A STUDENT FROM SACRAMENTO CITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FROM AT THE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WHICH SERVES ANY ANYWHERE BETWEEN FOR COLLEGES I CURRENTLY AM ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS AND LAST YEAR I WAS A STUDENT FELLOW WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FIRMWARE SEVERAL MY PEERS AND I LED A STUDENT OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. I SUPPORT ABC TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE BECAUSE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS BROADBAND SERVICES EQUALLY AND EQUITABLY WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGHOUT THE TIME IN THE KOBE PANDEMIC WE ARE HEADING INTO OUR THIRD YEAR STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS AND THEREFORE IN IN. CABLE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THE CLOSING OF THE DIVOT DIGITAL DIVIDE I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH COULD TRANSITION TO AN ONLINE LEARNING BECAME A PLOT THAT CAME A PLETHORA STUDENTS HER FIRST BUT THEIR EDUCATION ON HOLD STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF I'M HEADING INTO MY THIRD YEAR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT INTERNET RESOURCES EXPRESSLY GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN THE COPA PANDEMIC THE THIRTY YEAR MAY I EMPHASIZE. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE CTF FOUND AT THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS FROM HOME AND FIVE POINT NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER OR TABLET IMAGINE THAT BEING THE CASE FOR ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN CALIFORNIA CAN BE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND I'M ONE OF THOSE CALIFORNIA CAN COLLEGE STUDENTS. ANOTHER REPORT FROM THE MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC FOUND THAT WE WANT ONE HUNDRED THAT. CALIFORNIA CAN YOU STILL LIKE INTERNET. A I'M ONE OF THOSE TEAMS AS WELL. CALIFORNIA CANNOT RISK. A JOB. OF STUDENTS AND THE WORK. AND FUTURE WORKFORCE OVER BROADBAND INEQUITIES. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN A BOLD ACTION TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND BECOME A LEADER. AND AMONGST THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND DIGITAL EQUITY BUT THEY'RE STILL YET A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. WE CAN CELEBRATE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE WHILE REMAINING REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT. AND EVERY RESIDENT HAS ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE INTERNET WE ALSO NEED PERMIT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONNECTS ALL STUDENTS. TO THE DIGITAL CLUSTER MANAGERS THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN CONNECT TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. VOTE YES FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE THANK YOU. Q. WE ALSO HAVE ONE OPPOSITION WITNESS WE WOULD INVITE BERNIE OROZCO WITH C. C. T. H. PLEASE APPROACH THE WITNESS TABLE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BERNIER OSCAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE NOT THAT WERE OPPOSED TO DIGITAL EQUITY WE TOTALLY SUPPORT DID YOU EQUITY WE'RE WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE APPROACH THAT THIS BILL TAKES SO THERE'S TWO PARTS TO THIS BILL SO FIRST IT ESTABLISHES A RIGHT FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN TO HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS AND IS THAT RIGHT THAT SETS A LITIGIOUS FRAMEWORK FOR SUING SOMEONE EVERY EVERY EVERY LAW CENTER PARK THAT YOU MENTIONED. CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN VIOLATED SO SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET SUED ESTABLISHED IN THIS RIGHT NOT FROM IT BUT THAT'S A JURISDICTION OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CELL BUT THAT IS OFF TO THE SIDE THE SECOND ISSUE OF THIS BILL IS THE DUPLICATE DUPLICATIVE PROCESS THAT THE P. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED ESTABLISHING SOME NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. WITH THE GOAL OF LOOKING AT WHY OUR COMMUNITIES- MISSED IN BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT OR MISTER BROADBAND SERVICE AS A REDLINING IF YOU WILL- THE FCC HAS JUST OPENED A NEW PROCEEDING ON REDLINING ISSUE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY DO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES LACK BROADBAND ACCESS OR WHY DO CERTAIN CONSTITUENCIES LACK ACCESS TO BROADBAND FROM AN ADOPTION STANDPOINT BUT THE PC HAS HAD A TWO YEAR PRECEDING AND THE MAKING OF LOOKING AT THESE VERY SAME QUESTIONS. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS KIND OF JUMPING THE GUN OF THAT RESULTS FROM THOSE TWO STUDIES I THINK IT'S A WORTHY DISCUSSION TO HAVE THOUGH BECAUSE WE DO WONDER WHY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTEEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS ACCORDING TO THE PC FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS LACK BROADBAND SERVICE AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE AND THREE. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR THE HOUSEHOLD I THINK COMPLEMENT TO THE CABLE AND TELCO INDUSTRY FOR REACHING TO HAVE BROADBAND. BUT YET THEY'RE STILL ONE POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND WHO DON'T SIGN UP FOR THAT SERVICE STATE THE H. THEY DON'T ADOPT. THAT BROADBAND SERVICE SO WHEN WE LOOK AT DIGITAL ACTIVE EQUITY. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT LAND SO LASHER SIX BILLION DOLLARS WAS APPROPRIATED FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WEIGH IN ON HOW THAT SHOULD GO IT WAS TO UN SERVED AREAS OR AREAS FOR COMPETITION. I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE BEST DIGITAL EQUITY PLAN TO PUT FORWARD YOU DIDN'T PUT YOUR STAMP ON IT I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE. WE HAVE SOME FUNDS ARE GONNA BE COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS ON TOP OF THE ONES THAT WE RECEIVED. CALIFORNIA CAN GAIN BOUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM D. INVESTMENTS- THE I. I. J. A. D. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT JOBS ACT. SO ROUGHLY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS INCOME IT. SMARTLY THOUGH THIS TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS STATES BEFORE YOU RECEIVE THAT MONEY YOU MUST DEVELOP A DIGITAL EQUITY PLAN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOUR PROPOSAL ON ESTABLISHING THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THAT. BEFORE ANY STEPS GO FORWARD WE SHOULD HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE. TO GET THOSE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED TO GET THOSE ONE POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WHO COULD ACCESS BROADBAND WHO DON'T THAT WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY THEY DON'T AND LET'S GET THE- SHARE. ARE SOME- RACE WE SHE YOUR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL EQUITY WE JUST DON'T THINK THE BILL ABSTRACTED HERE. DOES THAT WE THINK THE BETTER WAYS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT TO PARTNER LASHER WE CARRIED UP LEGISLATION BY MR DALY- THAT WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SHARE WITH LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST BROADBAND PLANS THAT WE OFFER WHICH WE HAVE BEEN OFFERING FOR OVER TEN YEARS WE HAVE OFFERED LOW COST BROADBAND PLANS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. BUT THE HARD PART IN CTF NOTICES THE HARD PART IS GETTING THOSE FAMILIES AWARE OF THOSE THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PROGRAMS SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO RESOLVE THAT. AND THEN WE CARE LEGISLATION TO GET PUBLIC HOUSING- CONNECTED TO GET THE COMPUTERS THERE DIGITAL LITERACY LABS THAT WAS HELD IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. SO WE WANT TO JOIN YOU AND WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND HELP CLOSE. OUT BUT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO DIRECTLY JUST THE APPROACH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO SUPPORT WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE IN THE ROOM- YOU CAN. JOIN US AT THE MICROPHONE. SUPPORT WITNESSES ALL RIGHT NOT SEEN ANY WE WILL INVITE UP OPPOSITION WITNESSES. NOT SEEN ANY IN THE ROOM WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES- I'M NOT SURE MODERATOR IF THEY'RE SEPARATED BY SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION BUT WILL JUST OPEN THE PHONE LINES. Q.

IF YOU'D LIKE TO STATE OPPOSITION IN MARIN AND THE PREVIOUS Q. ME PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. DO YOU TURN ONLINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. RIGHT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO MY MEMBER BONTA. I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL IT IS VERY MUCH A COMPANION BILL FOR ME- FOR THE DIGITAL EQUITY PLAN. THAT WE WILL BE HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD AS WELL AB I REALLY LOVE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY STATES TO HAVE ENUMERATED A RIGHT TO. EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND I BELIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF TWENTY N. TYPE IN TIMES OF PLENTY. THAT WE ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT. WE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE THERE AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCEPTABLE BROADBND FOR ALL. AS ENUMERATED STATUTORY RATE IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS A RIGHT TO IT'S AS IF WE ARE OFFERING. DIGNITY REQUIRING DIGNITY AND DIGITAL ACCESS SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING FOR THIS BILL AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES. WITHIN ANY OTHER COMMENTS. REMEMBER LOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MANAGER- LIKE TO ECHO MY COMMENTS AS WELL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL DISTRICT THE DISTRICT I WORK FOR AS IN SILICON VALLEY BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IN THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MIGHT JUST ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE TESTIMONY YOU HEARD WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL AND- AS A AS A RIGHT- SIR. THEN IF THE HAD THE- RESIDENT WHO DESIRED TO- TO THE STATE IS THAT IS THAT HOW YOU WOULD FOR SEE THIS TO BE FUNCTION KEYS HELP CLICK CLARIFY. WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN THEN THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE TEETH IN THE MECHANISMS THAT WE WOULD HELP IMPLEMENT TO ENSURE THAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTENTIMES AS WE ALL SHARE HERE WE PASS. LEGISLATION BUT THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SEEMS TO GET AWAY FROM US AND I'M WE'RE REALLY. CLOSE TACKLING IT WERE TURNED OUT SO PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP IN LINE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THE BILL DOESN'T JUST SAY YOU WON'T HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO BROADBAND. IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY TO THE EXTENT TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. SO IF THE CABLE COMPANY SAYS IT TECHNICALLY TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IT CANNOT BE DONE. THEY CAN SHOW THAT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE JUST HAD THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS INVESTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THIS AND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR EVERY CHILD GOING TO SCHOOL AND FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD THAT NEEDS TO CONNECT THROUGH THE INTERNET- ANOTHER THING THAT IF I MAY THAT WAS. THAT WAS MENTIONED IS THE FACT THAT TO. WHAT THE C. P. U. C. WILL BE IS STUPID. IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLEMENTARY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. WHAT WE PASS HERE WILL BE FOR NAUGHT. WHITE HOUSE OF A BILL OF RIGHTS IF YOU CANNOT ENFORCE IT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE MECHANISM TO ENFORCE IT AND THAT'S AN EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF IT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR HANDS UP WILL GO AHEAD AND ASK YOU TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR SORRY DID YOU HAVE A- ONE MOVED BILL. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND SECOND.

IS SCHEDULED TO DROP THE FINAL PROGRAM RULES FOR THE TWO BILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WAS ALLOCATED. TO THE C. P. U. C. AND LAST YEAR'S SB ONE FIFTY SIX SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THIS IS THE TIME TO SPEAK UP- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION- AS THE RULES- THAT ARE ADOPTED. WHAT FOR APPLICANTS WILL ALSO- THE THESE FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE TIME LIMITS ON THEM SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THESE APPLICATIONS IN AND THEY GET OUT- AS A STATE IF WE DO NOT GET THIS RIGHT WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE OUT ON TIME SENSITIVE. FUNDING RESULTING AND UP WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE WHICH IS RETURNING FUNDS BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE DO NOT WANT TO SEND MONEY BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO. EXPLAIN THAT I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I PLANNED IT EXERCISE. VERY VIGILANT OVERSIGHT OF ALL THE AGENCIES IMPLEMENT SB ONE FIFTY SIX. BECAUSE AS WE KNOW WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND AS MANY OF THAT THAT MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THIS RIGHT WITH THE- THESE HUGE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FROM THE STATE. ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS IN THIS REPORT- WHICH MIGHT SURPRISE SOME OF US IS THAT EVERY MEMBER HERE. IN EVERY MEMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT ALL OF OUR- DISTRICTS HAVE UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS DONUT HOLES SOME DISTRICTS HAVE MORE UNSERVED AREAS THAN OTHERS- BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT. THIS BUT THERE IS AN ESTIMATED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS AND NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE. RURAL AND URBAN. IN THIS AFFECTS ALL OF US AS WAS NOTED FROM THE LAST PRESENTATION THAT IS HY WE ARE TO HERE TODAY TO DO OUR PART TO GET. THOSE UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED AND WE WANT TO DO THIS AS SUFFICIENTLY AND SMARTLY AS POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN AGREE ON THAT WITH THAT I'M GOING TO ASK IF OUR VICE CHAIR HAS ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE. HE DOES NOT THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND NOW WE WILL INNER DEUCE- FROM MR ROBERT OSBORNE THE FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- I KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY BUT WELCOME AND WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE. YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS HANDOUT- AT YOUR HANDS IF YOU DON'T JUST KIND OF RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE'LL GET IT TOO. WELCOME THANK YOU CHUCK QUIRK-SILVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE CPC'S LAST MILE BROADBAND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. MY NAME IS ROBERT OSBORNE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I'M HERE TO PROVIDE AN AN INFORMATION ON THE STATUS ON WHAT HAS CHANGED AND THOUGH I DEFERRED TO OUR FIVE COMMISSIONERS. ON WHO ARE EVALUATING THE RECORD AND VARIOUS POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION IN HERE AND IF WE RUN OUT OF TIME WILL BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MEMBERS LATER. THE BROADBAND LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR'S SPECIFICALLY SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN AND SENATE BILL FOUR DEMONSTRATED THE STATE SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. BY LEVERAGING FEDERAL RECOVERY FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT A STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK AND FUND LAST MILE BROADBAND NETWORKS. THE CPC RESPONDED QUICKLY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE HISTORIC LEGISLATION BY SKIPPING THE VARIOUS FUNDING PROGRAMS INTO TO CRITICAL. RULEMAKINGS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE'RE ON SLIDE TWO. SO THIS SLIDE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE VARIOUS BROADBAND INITIATIVES ENACTED WITH LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IN WHICH THE CPC IS INVOLVED. THE BOX IN THE LEFT SUMMARIZES THE CPC'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR MIDDLE MILE INITIATIVE LED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THE GREEN BOX IN THE MIDDLE IS THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS LAST MILE INITIATIVE KNOWN AS THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT. A PROPOSED DECISION ON THE RULES FOR THIS ACCOUNT SCHEDULED FOR VOTE TOMORROW BY THE COMMISSIONERS. THE BOX ON THE RIGHT SUMMARIZES THE OTHER SUPPORTING PROGRAMS TO TRY WILL GO INTO INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND WOULD PROVIDE UBSIDIES FOR THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. OF BROADBAND ADOPTION PUBLIC HOUSING AND TRAVEL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEXT IS THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE ACCOUNT WHICH PROVIDES UPFRONT CAPITAL FOR DEBT SECURITIZATION. AND FINALLY THE LOCAL AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING TO LOCAL AGENCIES FOR BROADBAND PLANNING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT TIMELINE AND I APOLOGIZE THE TEXT IS RATHER SMALL BUT I'LL JUST. GO THROUGH SOME KEY UPDATES HERE SO IS SHOWN IN THE TIMELINE IN AUGUST THE CPC SCOPE TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT INTO THE BROADBAND PROCEEDING. BETWEEN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER THE CPC DRAFTED THE PROPOSED PROGRAM RULES. IN JANUARY THIS YEAR THE US TREASURY RELEASED THEIR FINAL RULE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AND TOMORROW AS I SAID THE CBC'S SCHEDULED TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSED DECISION ON PROGRAM RULES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEGISLATIVE BROADBAND PACKAGE REMOVED A NUMBER OF LONG STANDING BARRIERS TO DEPLOYING BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UNSERVED AREAS. THE TOTAL FUNDING IS THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION APPROPRIATED BY AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. THE FUNDS ARE NOT LIMITED BY COORDINATION OR DISTRIBUTION BY FEDERAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CONNECT AMERICA FUND- THE RURAL DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY FUND. ON THE PACKAGE MODERNIZE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY BY INCREASING THE SPEED FOR WHAT'S DETERMINED AS UNSERVED. FROM SIX ONE TO TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THE TWENTY FIVE THREE AS WIRELINE ELIGIBILITY. THAT IS CONSIDERED RELIABLE. SO IT IN ADDITION THERE'S NO- RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO LET DELAYS- IT ALSO ALLOWS ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OBJECTION PROCESS WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY CAUSED DELAYS IN EVALUATING APPLICATIONS. APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN PARTIES FILED COMMENTS REPRESENTING A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS INCLUDING PUBLIC ENTITIES INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THE CALIFORNIA TRIBE IN A RANGE OF PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS RATEPAYER ADVOCATES AND NONPROFITS. I WILL GO NOW INTO SOME OF THE PROPOSED RULES AND REVISIONS IN MORE DETAIL NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SB ONE FIFTY SIX TASK THE CPC WITH DIVIDING TWO BILLION BETWEEN AND AMONG URBAN COUNTIES AND RURAL COUNTIES SO ONE BILLION TO URBAN COUNTIES AND ONE BILLION TO RURAL COUNTIES. THE ALLOCATION AND STATUTES STATES THAT EACH COUNTY RECEIVES A BASE AMOUNT OF FIVE MILLION WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS APPORTIONED BY THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS SERVED AT A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND BASED ONHISTORICAL AND FIXED IN TIME AT THE END OF THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT DATA. SO THE CPC MUST MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT QUALIFIES AS URBAN OR RURAL IN THE STATUTE. THE PROPOSED DECISION ADOPTS THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORKS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SEVEN METHODOLOGIES IN THE RECORD. THOSE INCLUDE THE CENSUS BUREAU THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE UTILITY FRONT REFORM NETWORKS PROPOSAL BALANCES THE TO SIGNIFICANT REALITIES FIRST. RURAL AREAS HAVE HIGHER CONSTRUCTION COSTS DUE TO MORE RUGGED TERRAIN POLLS WITH GREATER FAILURE RATES AND LOWER POPULATION DENSITY. URBAN COUNTIES BY CONTRAST HAVE A HIGHER NUMBER OF UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. AND A PROPOSED DECISION DISCUSSES THE METHODOLOGIES AND RATIONALE IN MORE DETAIL. NOW I'LL SPEAK ABOUT PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE PROPOSAL PROPOSED DECISION DEFINES ELIGIBLE AREAS AS THOSE THAT ARE UNSERVED BY WIRELINE PROVIDER THAT CAN RELIABLY PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND% DOWNLOAD THREE MEGABITS PER SECOND UP OR GREATER- AND WIRELINE PROVIDER EXCLUDES FIXED AND MOBILE WIRELESS SERVICE A RELIABLE EXCLUDES LEGACY DSL AN OLDER CABLE NETWORKS AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE U. S. TREASURY FINAL RULE. THE PROPOSED DECISION ESTABLISHES PRIORITY PROJECT AREAS AS LARGE PORTIONS OR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OFUNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. THIS WILL HELP MITIGATE PAST ISSUES WITH APPLICANTS CHERRY PICKING ONLY WEALTHY PARTS OF COMMUNITIES. THE PROPOSED DECISION ALLOWS APPLICANTS TO PROPOSE THE ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION OF OTHER HOUSEHOLDS BASED ON A DEMONSTRATION OF BROADBAND NEED CONSISTENT WITH THE US TREASURY RULES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW COVERED THE SLIDE- THE TITLE THE VALUATION CRITERIA SO THE PROPOSED DECISION SETS OUT SCORING CRITERIA FOR APPLICATIONS TOTALING A HUNDRED POINTS AS DETAILED IN THE SLIDE. SO BUILDING A PUBLIC NETWORK GETS TWENTY POINTS SERVING A COMMISSION IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS TWENTY POINTS PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS TEN POINTS BUILDING FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE TEN POINTS. PROVIDING LIFELINE SERVICE TEN POINTS APPLICANT EXPERIENCE TEN POINTS PROJECT VIABILITY TEN POINTS AND LEVERAGING STATE MIDDLE MILE ALSO REQUIRES THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION TO INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY STATUS IN DEVELOPING PRIORITY AREAS AND ONE OF THAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT LIST OF SCORING CRITERIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE PROPOSED DECISION INCLUDES TWO REQUIREMENTS BASED ON US TREASURIES FINAL RULE. FIRST THE PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC'S AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM. AND THAT ANY ADDITIONAL LOW COST OPTION BE WITHOUT DATA CAPS AND AT SUFFICIENT SPEEDS. THE PROPOSED DECISION REQUIRES A LOW COST OPTION FOR- FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SORRY FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A FIFTY MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWN AND FIFTY MEGABITS PER SECOND UP WITH THE FLEXIBILITY IF NEEDED BY AN APPLICANT. IT OFFERS EXTRA POINTS IF PARTICIPATING IN MY FIND AND THAT AFFORDABLE PLANS BE OFFERED FOR THE LIFE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. PLAN PRICES CAN BE LOWERED BUT CANNOT INCREASE FOR TEN YEARS WITHOUT COMMISSION APPROVAL. THERE'S A WAIVER PROCESS- THE FOR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES OR FOR A MODEL SUCH AS SERVICE BASED COMPETITION MODEL THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED MORE SPECIFICALLY- DOWN THE ROAD BUT THIS WAIVER PROCESS THAT I'M MENTIONING IS SOMETHING THAT. HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE REVISED PROPOSED DECISION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE PROPOSED DECISION OUTLINES THE PROCESS FOR ENTITIES TO OBJECT TO A PROPOSED PROJECT AREA IS ALREADY SERVED FOR HAVING DEMONSTRATED BROADBAND NEED THAT IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE BROADBAND MAPPING DATA. THE PROPOSED DECISION REFORMS THE PROCESS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS CHALLENGE PROCESS WHICH CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND JUST TO NOTE THAT THE US TREASURY'S FINAL RULE ENCOURAGES FUNDING PORTIONS OF CERTAIN AREAS IF NEEDED FOR CONDIMENTS OF SCALE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE PROPOSED DECISION DELEGATES TO THE CPC COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION STAFF THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE STRAIGHTFORWARD NON CONTROVERSIAL APPLICATIONS THAT MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. IN ORDER TO EXPEDITIOUSLY GRANT FUNDS. THE REQUIREMENTS WERE INFORMED BY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA VENTS SERVICES FUND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM MINISTER OVERVIEW THE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MINISTERIAL REVIEW AN APPLICATION NEEDS TO MEET THE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FIRST- CANNOT RECEIVE ANY VALID OBJECTIONS OR COMPETING APPLICATIONS. OF THE TOTAL PROJECT VALUE MUST BE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION- IT CANNOT REQUIRE ANY SEEK FOR REVIEW- THE TOTAL COST PER HOUSEHOLD NEEDS TO BE- BELOW THE NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A PER HOUSEHOLD THRESHOLD. AND THERE CAN'T BE ANY WAIVER OR OTHER- OTHERWISE ANY DEVIATION FROM PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. BACKSLIDE PLEASE. SO THE REVISIONS THAT WERE PUBLISHED YESTERDAY MAKE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE PROPOSED DECISION IN RESPONSE TO PARTY COMMENTS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE PROPOSED DECISION IS SCHEDULED FOR VOTE TOMORROW SUMMARIZING THE REVISIONS SO ON AFFORDABILITY THE REVISIONS DO NOT CHANGETHE TENURE PRICE CAP AND- THE FORTY DOLLAR LOW COST PLAN. THESE CAN BE MODIFIED BY WAIVERS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE REVISIONS CLARIFY THE WAIVER PROCESS AND ADDED LANGUAGE TO SHOW POSSIBLE CRITERIA FOR WAIVER INCLUDING INFLATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE LETTER OF CREDIT REQUIREMENTS THE PROVISIONS REMOVED THE LETTER OF CREDIT REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. I'M PRIORITY AREAS- THE- REVISED- PROPOSED DECISION ADDS DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS A FACTOR FOR PROJECTS SELECTION. AND FINALLY ON THE OBJECTION- CHALLENGE PROCESS THE REVISIONS CLARIFY THE OBJECTION PROCESS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS PROVIDER CONCERNS WITH SUBMITTING CONSUMERS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO VERIFY THAT IN AREAS ALREADY SERVED AND AT ITS WORST- STREAMLINED THE INFORMATION THAT'S TO BE FILED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IT'S NOT GOING TO SWITCH TO THE LOCAL AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY DATES- IN SEPTEMBER THE CPC ISSUED A STOP PROPOSAL WITH PROGRAM ROLES RELEASED SOLICITED COMMENTS AND REPLY COMMENTS IN JANUARY THIS YEAR THE CPC RELEASED A PROPOSED DECISION SOLICITED COMMENTS AND REPLY COMMENTS AND AT THE END OF FEBRUARY THE CPC ADOPTED FINAL PROGRAM ROLES.

ON THE IMPLEMENTATION SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE BROADBAND PACKAGE TASK THE CBC WITH THE WARNING FIFTY MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- TO PUBLIC ENTITIES AND NONPROFITS TO PREPARE- TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY SO A LOCAL AGENCY IN THIS IS COME UP SEVERAL TIMES WHAT IS A LOCAL AGENCY IT'S LISTED AND IN THE DECISION SO.

NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NEXT WE'RE GONNA SWITCH TO THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE AND HERE'S SOME KEY MILESTONES JUST TO RECAP THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE IS A FUND INTENDED TO PROVIDE UPFRONT CAPITAL TO SECURITIZED DEBT. FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT SO IN SEPTEMBER THE PC ISSUED AN AMENDED SCOPING ROLLING TO INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM IN MARCH THE PC ISSUED A RULING REQUESTING COMMENT ON LOAN LOSS RESERVE STRUCTURE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FINANCING REPORTING A STEP PROPOSALS PLANNED FOR AUGUST OF THIS YEAR FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'RE TARGETING THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOUR- BEGINNING TOWARD FUNDS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE BRIEFLY OUT SNAPSHOT OF THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE- THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- OVER THREE YEARS COMMITTED FOR THE PROGRAM. AS I SAID THE PURPOSE IS TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES TO FINANCE AND BUILD OUT THEIR OWN LAST MILE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE LAW MUST RESERVE FUND WILL PROVIDE COLLATERAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENABLE BETTER BORROWING RATES AND TERMS FOR BONDS ISSUED TO DEPLOY BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS COMMENTS OF THE PROGRAM- WE'RE DUE MARCH FIRST NO WE HAD OPENING COMMENTS REGARDING QUESTIONS ON THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION WERE DUE LAST FRIDAY. AND REPLY COMMENTS ARE DUE APRIL TWENTY SECOND. WERE AIMING TO ISSUE A STAFF PROPOSAL FOR COMMENT BY AUGUST OF THIS YEAR. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO FINALLY THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND SO BRIEFLY ALL THE CASF CALIFORNIANS ARE SENT SERVICES FUND INFRASTRUCTURE APPLICATIONS WERE ACTED ON BEFORE THE END OF LAST YEAR. IN JANUARY THE CPC DEVELOPED DRAFT PROGRAM ROLES A PROPOSAL FOR LEGACY CASF SUB ACCOUNTS AND SUB ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS ASSIGNING RESOURCES TO PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. A MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY RULING PROPOSED RULE MODIFICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HOUSING ACCOUNT THE ADOPTION ACCOUNT AND THE CONSORTIA COUNT. THE RULING ALSO PROPOSED CASF SUB ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND INVITED PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT PROPOSAL FINAL ROLES AND ALLOCATIONS WILL- BE ADOPTED BY DECISION AS EARLYAS- JUNE AND THOSE INCLUDE- THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FOR THE SUB ACCOUNTS.

EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF ELIGIBLE COSTS OFF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE MORE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS- THE PUBLIC HOUSING ADOPTION CONSORTIUM. SO I REALIZE IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT I WENT THROUGH AND- THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU EXCELLENT- HAND OUT AND INFORMATION IN AS THE MEMBERS MIGHT AGREE THERE IS QUITE A BIT TO TAKE CAN AND WE APPRECIATE. YOUR HARD WORK- I THINK I'M GONNA OPEN UP TO OUR VICE CHAIR FIRST IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO AND WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES I APPRECIATE YOUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT YOU REFER ON THE SET UP HEARINGS TAKING US VERY METHODICALLY THROUGH IT. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS NONE OF MY CITIES ARE TRYING TO DO A PUBLIC AND YOU KNOW BROADBAND RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY THE CITIES DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT IT- I'M CONCERNED I'M NOT CONCERNED I'D LIKE TO HEAR AN EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU THINK- SOME OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL COME INTO OCEANSIDE'S SPECIFICALLY THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT- WITH THE TEN YEAR PRICE FREEZE ACTIVATE YOU CAUGHT A CAP. THE CONFERENCE BUT WITH THE TAKING OF THE TEN YEAR CAP JUST KNOWING HOW TECHNOLOGY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE ADVANCED IT SEEM AN LOOKING AT INFLATION AND SOME OTHER- ASPECTS IT SEEMS TENURE SEEMS A VERY LONG TIME TO EXPECT THAT ANYBODY WOULD FIND THAT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE EVEN WITH PUBLIC FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT I THINK I NEED AN OCEANSIDE CAN YOU WALK THROUGH YOUR LOGIC OF THE CAP AND HOW TO HOW ARE YOU ACCOUNTING. FOR ON THE INCREASE GIVEN EITHER TECHNOLOGICAL INCREASES OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS OR INFLATION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW ONE ONE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR INFLATION IN THE CAP OVER TEN YEARS IF YOU'RE GONNA GO THAT LONG SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GUYS GONNA DO THAT SOME OF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE CERTAINLY FIRST I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT THE INTEREST BY THE MAJOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THIS TOPIC IT MAY BE DEMONSTRATE THEIR INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD- PROBABLY THREE A THREE HEADED THE FIVE MAJOR PROVIDERS THAT ACCOUNT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND OVER THE PAST DECADE SETTLE I'M- THE CASE TWELVE. THE MAJOR PROVIDERS- SECOND OF ALL I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT- THE PC'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE PAST TEN YEARS IS THAT THE YIELD ON THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY LOW BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY AND MIGHT SAY FORD ABILITY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS NOT THE LOWING ARE YOU ABLE TO CALL FOR THE. ATP CONTACT THE PER PEOPLE WHO FALL OUT OF THAT TWO HUNDRED POPULAR WHICH IS A SIX PORTION THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR LIFE LINER FOR SNAP SO THAT'S READ THE LOGIC BEHIND HAVING AN AFFORDABLE PLAN THE IDEA BEHIND HAVING THE TENURE IS WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE FEDERAL MONEY IN THE INVESTMENT. REALLY TRYING TO GET THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK SO- THAT'S THE IDEA BUT BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT AS AS YOU SORT OF ALLUDED TO WE HAVE INTRODUCED THIS WAIVER CAPABILITY AND WE HAVE WE HAVE IN THE PAST UNDER CASF HAVE PROVIDERS APPLY FOR A WAIVER FOR THINGS SUCH AS A PRICE FOR A PRICE CAP- OVER A PERIOD AND CASF IT'S FOR TWO YEARS BUT WE'REINCREASING THAT TO TEN SO THERE ISN'T. AN ABILITY FOR PROVIDERS TO COME IN AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE IN LIEU OF WHAT YOU HAVE IS A REQUIREMENT. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE OF. SORRY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AFFORDABILITY IF I COULD TO THE CHAIR. WE LOOK AT THE FORT ABILITY. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO'S AT 4100% OF THE FIVE POVERTY LEVEL. AND SOMEBODY LIKE MAYBE SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS AN INFINITY. AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE LOOK FOR THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK. THAT WE USED TO HAVE SOME. CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM TODAY MISS SAID THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AFFORDABILITY. THAT'S CORRECT AFFORDABLE PLAN DOES NOT HAVE ANY REQUIREMENTS- THE IDEAS THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE A BASIC PLAN THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF INCOME LIMIT- BASED ON THE- INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IN THE NETWORK SWITCHES UP TO A 100% OF THE NETWORK WERE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING. FREE NETWORKS TWO CARRIERS. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING FOR GOING TO BE PROVIDING YOU WITH THIS FREE NETWORK OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OPERATING COSTS BUT- WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME BASIC. STANDARD PLAN THAT PEOPLE CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT AS YOU WERE JUST SAYING THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT THREE OF THE FIVE HAVE NEVER APPLIED FOR CASH THE FUNDING. AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE CREATING A PLAN WHERE THOSE THREE OR FIVE. PROBABLY WON'T EVER APPLY FOR THIS BECAUSE IF I WERE RUNNING THESE COMPANIES I WOULDN'T APPLY FOR IT. IF I ADDED A YOU KNOW A TWO YEAR. CAP MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU YOU GENERALLY IN THE INDUSTRY CAN PROJECT OUT WHAT ARE YOUR COSTS FOR TWO YEARS. REAPPLY READJUST- AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN INCOME REQUIREMENT ON IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM SO IF YOU'RE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS 95% THE NETWORK. AND IN CITIES LIKE MINE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC. OPTION DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM THAT I BASICALLY THINK. PLACES WITH PUBLIC OPTIONS WILL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. THE I. S. B. THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL NOT BUILD OUT IN OCEANSIDE. AND OCEANSIDE WILL BE LEFT BEHIND AT OCEANSIDE IS TYPICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND. SO I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS IS CONSTRUCTED I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE PC. TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT. SETTING SOME SORT OF INCOME AVAILABILITY AROUND THIS. AND THINKING ABOUT CITIES THAT DO NOT WILL NOT HAVE A PUBLIC OPTION ON MY CITIES WILL EVER HAVE A PUBLIC OPTION THAT'S NOT ANYTHING TO DO- SO. REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE CONSIDER A FIVE YEAR CAP. RATHER IT RATHER THAN A TEN YEAR TENURE JUST SEEMS LIKE. FAR TOO LONG IN THE FUTURE AND THIS TOO MANY OPTION. THIS TOO MUCH UNPREDICTABILITY A TEN YEAR CAP. THAN  TWO YEAR CAP. SO MAYBE YOU NEED TO INCREASE OF FROM TWO I TOTALLY GET THAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING THEM YOU KNOW BASICALLY. PUBLIC FUNDING YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT PUBLIC BENEFITS I GET. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT CALCULATION. I THINK MAYBE YOUR NUMBERS OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OFF. AND REALLY CONSIDER THE PSC. WE CONSIDER. THE TIME FRAME. AND ADDING AFFORDABILITY LIMIT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED THE FORD ABILITY. WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND pPEOPLE WHO DO NEED THE AFFORDABILITY LIKE IN OCEANSIDE WON'T GET IT. AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE OBJECTIVE THAT I THINK WE HAS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE GIVEN- OR THAT I WOULD WANT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I. BEFORE IT'S ANOTHER TOPIC I DID WANT TO CONCUR WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FROM THE SOUTH BOERNER HORVATH I WANT TO SIT AROUND WHERE BOERNER HORVATH. COULD YOU GET OKAY BOERNER HORVATH- I D. I TO HAVE THAT FIRST I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRE THAT APPLICANTS BE OFFERED A LOW COST COST PLAN TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD. THE TREASURY FINAL ROLE- SAYS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LOW COST PLAN DOESN'T SAY TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD BUT IT DOES SAY THE VAST TO BE OFFERED. BECAUSE MY CONCERN- AND I'VE EXPRESSED THIS BEFORE IT IS FOR SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE. MOST NEEDING THIS PROGRAM THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO GET THE PROGRAM- OR INFORMATION AND THEN FOR OTHERS WHO ARE- YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THEY MAY IN FACT GET THOSE- BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH THE FIVE YEAR I MEAN IN THIS CLIMATE THAT W ARE WITH INFLATION ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE SEE AS FAR AS PRICE CHANGE IN A TEN YEAR PRO. AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT USING- YOU DID MAKE A CHANGE FROM NOT USING FREEZE TO WHAT YOU CHANGED IT TO A TO A CAP BUT I MAY BE A FIVE YEAR REVIEW WOULD BE SOMETHING I THINK COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF THE MIDDLE GROUND THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER P. I WANT TO JOIN WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THIS KIND OF CONCERNED. ABOUT A TAPE BUT LITTLE BIT OF A STEP FURTHER I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF SOME OF THESE- GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. OUR ATTEMPT WITH A TEN YEAR AND A CAP THAT I THINK IT'S FORTY. I THINK WE MAY END UP WITH- GOOD INTENTIONS AND BANKRUPTCIES. THIS IS REALLY A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND WE HAVE BEEN HERE NOW AT LEAST THE SECOND. TIME WE'VE SAT AND TALKED ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT A- AT A RATE. FREEZE CAP FOR TEN YEARS THAT'S NUMBER ONE I MEAN NUMBER TWO I CONCUR WITH THE CONCERN THAT YOU ARE CREATING A TEMPLATE WHICH IS A DISINCENTIVE TO THE VERY PRIVATE SECTOR GROUPS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT. AND I THINK THAT THE IF THIS IS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER IT AT BOTH AT THE RATE M. VIA THE TIME PERIOD- I THINK THERE'S A GENERAL CONSENSUS HERE THAT THIS IS A THIS IS AN ONGOING CONCERN. AND THIS IS THE SECOND HEARING I'VE SAT THROUGH I DON'T SEE ANY FIX TO THIS HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TELL YOU TO PROBLEM. WE'RE JUST HOPING MAYBE THERE THERE COULD BE SOME GOING BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION I KNOW THAT THERE IS A VOTE TOMORROW AND WE- WERE KIND OF IN. THIS SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE THIS URGENCY WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO MOVE FORWARD- IF WE'RE NOT CONFIDENT ON SOME OF THE MEASURES. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE CONFLICTING MESSAGES THAT YOU. AND OTHERS THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS ARE GETTING AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE- YOU KNOW OVERBEARING WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY WE'RE NOT. WHERE WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH- THE FORTY DOLLAR AND THE TEN YEAR- BUT AGAIN I THINK WE'VE EXPRESSED THAT SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO A QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING. WELL I WAS GONNA HAMMER HAMMER IT HOME AGAIN I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT THE OTHER CONCERN ISAROUND THE- LONGER TERM INFRASTRUCTURE I IN THIS WORLD UNLIKE OTHER. OTHER AT UTILITIES IT'S CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING RIGHT WE'VE LIVED IN A VERY SHORT TIME. FROM GOING FROM THREE G. TO FOUR G. TO FIVE G. IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF RATE OF SPEED THAT'S- THAT'S REQUIRED OR AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND WHAT I WOULD HATE TO SEE HAPPEN. IN EVEN IN URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE- IN OAKLAND WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOR- THAT PRIVATE ENTITIES WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO. A TO PROVIDED SO I DO SEE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A LONGER TERM- CONCERN IT IN TERMS OF ONGOING INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE- THROUGH A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AS THIS IS INTENDED TO BE. A TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS GRANT PROGRAM IF WE ARE- THAT. NOT PROVIDING THE CAPACITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHIN. A GIVEN THE LONG TIME RANGE THAT WHERE ASSOCIATING WITH THIS SO I WOULD. HOPE THAT WE CONSIDER AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR BE PARITY BETWEEN. THIS PROGRAM- AND THAT THAT THE OTHER PROGRAM THAT HAS A TWO YEAR LIMITATION. THANK YOU I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARTNER HERE HORVATH I'LL GET IT TBH TASHA. I OF ALL NAMES I AM INTERESTED. TO MAKE SOME FURTHER COMMENTS FIGHTERS- SOMMAIRE PATTERSON REMINDED ME ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I READ THE PROPOSAL THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THE FOR EXCLUDING SOME OF THE START UPS THAT COME AND TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. ARM BUT I REALLY DO THINK WITH A CAP OVER TEN YEARS WHAT WHAT I DON'T SEE IS A CONTROL FOR THE VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY. SO THAT THEY DON'T GO BANKRUPT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE THE WORST OUTCOME FOR US IS OF A SMALL COMPANY COMES IN. RIGHT AND THE ABSENCE OF THE BIG COMPANIES GOING IN SMALL COMPANY COMES IN ALWAYS SUPPORTER SMALL START UPS RIGHT THAT'S GREAT THAT'S THAT'S GREAT COME COMPETITION THAT'S FINE. BUT THEY WOULD COME AND THEY WOULD BE OVER AMBITIOUS AND WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GO FOR THE TEN YEARS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT SO FIVE YEARS THEN. THEY GO BANKRUPT DO WE HAVE A PLAN FOR ONE OF THESE COMPANIES TO GET THE FUNDING GO BANKRUPT WE HAVE. IS THERE SOME FEEL SAFE THAT IS BUILT INTO YOUR PROGRAM. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BANKRUPTCIES THAT MAY HAPPEN. WHAT WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON COMPANIES GOING BANKRUPT I TAKE YOUR POINT. THAT YOU SHOULD PLAN FOR COMPANIES GOING BACK UP WE SHOULD ALWAYS PLAN FOR COMPANIES. ESPECIALLY WITH SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AROUND THE TEN YEAR CAP AT FORTY DOLLARS YOUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT WORKS. OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THE MAINTENANCE OF THOSE LINES AND YOU KNOW SO WHETHER WE HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE AND- AN OCEAN SIDE OF MY DISTRICT ARE YOUR FIRES OR FLOODS YOU HAVE. OTHER THINGS THAT WILL REQUIRE MAINTENANCE AND THE SMALLER COMPANIES WILL JUST NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO KEEP THAT OVER TIME SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE SOME THOUGHT TO BE GIVEN. ON THE VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND IF THEY WERE ABLE ARE THE FULL VIABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATION HOWEVER IS PROVIDED. THE FUNDING. HOW LIQUID THEY ARE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND COST OVER TIME. RIGHT MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD JUST MAKE. HEALTH POINTS COURTS FIRST IS THAT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE COST PER MEGABIT DECLINED 90% SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTY MEGABITS PER SECOND. THE COST PER MEGABIT DECLINING 90% OVER TEN YEARS. THIS COULD BE AN ACADEMIC ISSUE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN. INFLATION YOU HAVE LABOR COSTS CETERA IT SECOND POINT IS THAT THERE IS A WAIVER PROCESS THAT WE INCLUDE IN THE PROPOSED DECISION AND THE COMMISSION COULD CERTAINLY TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND PROVIDE WAIVERS TO COMPANIES. I WOULD OVER TO YOU NEXT I JUST WANT REAL QUICKLY ON THE WAIVER- I KNOW KNOWS THAT IN THE INFORMATION YOU PUT THAT THIS- C. P. U. C. IS REQUESTING 46% OF POSITIONS TO. IMPLEMENT ON THE WAY. ALSO ACTED MINISTER THE WAIVER PROCESS- I'M JUST WANTING TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE POSITIONS RELATED TO THE WAIVERS AND WHAT HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT- THE FORTY SIX POSITIONS ARE NOT TO IMPLEMENT THE WAIVER PROCESS THERE TO IMPLEMENT THE VARIOUS FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT I WENT THROUGH. SO IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE WAIVER NOW BECAUSE I WAS GETTING VERY NERVOUS THEY GET A FAIR EXPECTED A LOT OF WAIVERS- ALL RIGHT SO IT'S FOR ALL OF THE WORK FOR ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JUST AS A GENERAL. BACK COMMENT HERE TO LET. EVERYBODY ON THIS DIET WANTS THIS DONE. THE PRIVATE SECTOR ONCE THIS DONE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE GOING ON TEN YEARS NOW AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WE BANNED NOT TAKING MONEY FROM RATEPAYERS PUT IT IN FUNDS WE WANT THIS DONE. HOW CAN YOU ASSURE MEMBERS HERE THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT GOING TO BE. OUR THE S. HOLD UP IN ALL OF THIS. M. IN MIKE ALMOST TEN YEARS HERE BUT THE PC'S BEEN MORE THE PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN A SOLUTION. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY WE HAVE LOTS OF INTEREST LOTS OF MONEY. AND YET I JUST SAT THROUGH A BUNCH OF SLIDES AND A BUNCH OF. TIMELINES AND A BUNCH OF. BUREAUCRATIC. HOW CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET THIS GET DONE INSTEAD OF BEING THE STICK IN THE MUD. WELL I WOULD POINT TO OUR TRACK RECORD WITH THE CALIFORNIA VANCE SERVICES FUND IN ISSUING GRANTS. TO PROVIDE LAST MILE FUNDING. AND GETTING PROGRAMS UP AND GOING IN CALIFORNIA. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FORTY DOLLAR PLAN FOR FIFTY MEGABITS PER SECOND. IN BORING CALIFORNIA THERE'S A COMPANY THAT WE FUNDED THE PROVIDES GIGABIT SERVICE. FOR SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH USING FIBER OPTIC. AND THAT IS A PRODUCT OF THE CALIFORNIA EBT SERVICES FUND. WELL WE WILL SEE HOW THIS ALL GOES MY GUESS IS WE'LL BE BACK HERE. ASKING SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS ARE IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP WE WILL THANK YOU WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT- COMPLEX- MANDATE THAT HAS BEEN UP. MOVE FOR FORWARD BY THIS LEGISLATION AND WE I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE SAME- THING IN MIND WHICH IS. LET'S JUST GET THIS DONE AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU BUT AFTER THINKING MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE WILL COME TO OUR NEXT PART OF THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING OR LAST MILE BROADBAND CONNECTING THE UNSERVED AND THAT IS ITEM NUMBER THREE THE LAST MILE FUNDING. WE HAVE COMING TO US FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY. CALAVERAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR JACK GARAMENDI. AND KERRY ASK YOU BAILEY WHO IS- THE GROUP VICE PRESIDENT OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS- I WILL JUST EXTEND I BELIEVE IT'S HE'S YOUR UNCLE FATHER FATHER OKAY WELL I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING HIM ONE TIME MANY YEARS AGO UP HERE- WELCOME. AND ARE YOU LEADING US OFF I WASN'T SURE WHAT I WAS GOING FIRST I THINK WE HAVE YOU GOING FIRST SUPERVISOR ALL RIGHT WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SPORT MY NAME IS JACK ARMENIAN I AM COUNTY SUPERVISOR FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY SPOTTER OUR IN HOUSE SOUTH EAST OF SACRAMENTO- I REPRESENT THE SECOND. DISTRICT THERE. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE NEWLY CREATED JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY GOLDEN STATE CONNECTED STORY WHICH I WANT TO EXPLAIN FURTHER IN OUR COMMENTS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO BUILD INTERNET. ACCESSIBILITY FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA I APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE SCREEN TODAY ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SAID BEFORE US. I WANT TO ADDRESS HOW THE INFLUX OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR THE MONUMENTAL SHIFT IN STATE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT POLICY COMBINED WITH THE INNOVATION THAT IS GOING WITH INNOVATION. IS GOING TO MAKE A REAL MEANINGFUL CHANGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AS A SUPERVISOR REPRESENTING A RURAL AREA AND MEMBER OF THE RULE. COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA CHINOS RC RC MY COMMENTS HERE TODAY WILL FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN. THESE CHANGES PROVIDE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY COVER 50% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS THE LACK RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. PROVIDING EQUITABLE INTERNET ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT REGARD TO INCOME OR LOCATION IS A GOAL THAT I SHARE WITH THE STATE. AND THIS PANEL AND I AM EXCITED TO TELL YOU HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CAN BE AND WILL BE LEADING PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT. THE NEED FOR RELIABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS FOR EVERY RESIDENTS IN THE STATE IS SELF EVIDENT. THE INTERNET IS NOW PUBLIC NECESSITY AND A VITAL SERVICE IT DRIVES OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEALTH EDUCATION AND MANY WAYS OUR FUTURE. AND THAT IS WHY WE AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FOCUSING FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE WAYS TO UTILIZE THE GOOD WORK THAT THIS BODY DEAD LAST YEAR TO BRING FORWARD QUALITY INTERNET TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. HEY MR OSBORNE CENTER BEFORE'S DETAILED HIS PRESENTATION SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH BUDGET SB ONE FIFTY SIX LAST YEAR. I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS PRIMARILY ON TWO OF THOSE FUNDING PROGRAMS THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT. FF A PER GRANT PROGRAM AND THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT LOL ARE PERFECT OUT. AND HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BEST LEVERAGE THOSE INVESTMENTS THE FIRST I WANTED US TO POLICY CHANGE MADE LAST YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING AND HOW THOSE THINGS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO CREATE A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW THE STATE SUPPORTS BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. I BELIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POLICY CHANGES PARALLELS A PROCESS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH AND THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN BETTERING THE LIVES OF MANY RURAL. AMERICANS THE RULE ELECTRIFICATION ACT. IN STATES LACKED ELECTRICITY. MANY OF THESE FORMS ORIGINAL HOMESTEADS INCENTIVIZE CULTIVATED LAND IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HOMESTEAD ACT. AS ELECTRICITY. BECAME MORE COMMONPLACE IN CITIES. THE RULE AREAS BIG. CONSEQUENTLY MORE DARK AS PRIVATE ELECTRICAL COMPANIES SKEPTICAL ABOUT RECOUPING COSTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE CHOOSE NOT TO DELIVER POWER TO THESE AREAS. TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF ROLE HAVING PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ESTABLISHED THE RULE ELECTRIFICATION ACT. WHICH PROVIDED LOW INTEREST LOANS TO BUILD LINES AND PROVIDE SERVICE WHERE FOR PROFIT UTILITIES WOULD NOT. EARLY ON IN THIS PROGRAM IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WERE NOT INTERESTED IN FEDERAL LOANS. BUT HOWEVER LOCAL COMMUNITY COOPERATIVES WORK. MOST OF THE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNITED STATES TODAY IS A PRODUCT OF THESE LOCALLY OWNED NOT FOR PROFIT RULE ELECTRICAL COOPS. HISTORICALLY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ATTEMPTED TO INCENTIVIZE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY SUBSIDIZING INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICE AND HIGH COST UNDERSERVED AREAS. UNFORTUNATELY ALTHOUGH THE STATE HAS BEEN FUNDING DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THE BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. WE ARE HERE AGAIN. STILL TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. I BELIEVE THAT IS WHY THIS BODY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AS PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DID OVER EIGHTY YEARS AGO UNLIKE THE RULE AMERICANS THAT BANDED TOGETHER TO BRING ELECTRICITY TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE JOINED TOGETHER NOW TO LEVERAGE THE PUBLIC FUNDING AND PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR TO FINALLY BRING BROADBAND TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE POLICY CHANGES MADE LAST YEAR EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE BROADBAND SERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS LEGISLATION REMOVE BARRIERS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RECEIVE CALIFORNIA ADVANCE SERVICES FUNDS GRANTS FOR LAST MILE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IT CREATED. THE LOCAL AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSIST ON THE CLEATED ADMITS AND PREPARING. FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT IN THE RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS AND MADE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNT. SB ONE FIFTY SIX ALSO ESTABLISHED A LOAN LOSS RESERVE FUND CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AND JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY'S JPA IS. TO LEVERAGE. THE CAPITAL FOR PRIVATE FUNDING A BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. TOGETHER THESE CHANGES HAVE ALLOWED THE FORMATION OF THE GOLDEN STATE CONNECT THE THORGY JPA WHICH COMPRISES OF THIRTY NINE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. WITH THE MISSION TO BUILD OPEN ACCESS PUBLICLY FUNDED PUBLICLY OWNED FIBER CONNECTIONS TO THE HOME OF UNDERSERVED RESIDENTS GOLDEN STATE CONNECTED STORY OR GS CA ISN'T INNOVATIVE MODEL FOR DEPLOYMENT US WILL BROADBAND. OUR BASED UPON A PIONEER PROGRAM IN UTAH CALLED UTOPIA FIBER WHICH HAS SUCCESSFULLY DESIGNED BUILT AND OPERATED OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FIBER PROJECTS IN FIFTY DIFFERENT CITIES. RC RC STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS WITH UTOPIA. REPLICATE A MODEL THAT WILL WORK IN CALIFORNIA. PROBLEM THE PROGRAM IS QUITE SIMPLE IN CONCEPT GOLDEN STATE CONNECTED THIRTY WILL USE FUNDS AWARDED FROM THE CPUC LOAN LOSS RESERVE FUND TO SECURE REVENUE BONDS ISSUED BY OUR GPA TO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS GOLD STAY CONNECTED TOWARD TO LEVERAGE PUBLIC LOW MUST RESERVE FUNDS TO SECURE FIVE EIGHT TIMES THE LAST LOAN LOSS RESERVE AMOUNT THROUGH BOND ISSUANCE. AS I STATED THIS IS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A OPEN ACCESS PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. MEANING THAT MANY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CREATING COMPETITION IN OPTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. PUT SIMPLY THIS MODEL WILL ALLOW PRIVATE CAPITAL. TO BUILD BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO THE FULLY SUBSIDIZED PATIENT BOUGHT. THAT THE STATE HAS TYPICALLY AND TRADITIONALLY USED. IN ORDER TO START CONSTRUCTION FAST AND I KNOW THAT WAS THE ISSUE EARLIER IN THIS COMMITTEE. GOLDEN STATE CONNECT THE TORTILLAS LOOKING AT PROJECT AREAS THAT WILL BE IT THAT WILL BE VIABLE BUT THE FEDERAL FUND OUT ACCOUNT GRANTS ALONE WELL THE CPUC CONCERT CONTINUES TO CONSIDER. THE LOAN LOSS RESERVE. AUTISTIC CONNECT IS ALSO WORKING TO MAKE SURE COUNTIES ARE PREPARED FOR BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT. AS THE FUNDING BEGINS TO FLOW. WE ARE OFFERING APPLICATION SUPPORT TO MEMBER COUNTIES FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANT GRANT FUND WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP FUND PRE DEVELOPMENT WORK. SUCH AS SPEED OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. LASTLY RC RC HAS APPLIED FOR FEDERAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY FUNDING ON BEHALF OF ITS MEMBERS. TO COMPLETE BROADBAND PLAN THE TWENTY SEVEN REMAINING. MANY MEMBER COUNTIES WITHOUT A CURRENT BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT PLAN. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS GOLDEN STATE CONNECT THIRTY TODAY. WE INVEST MUCH THE LAST TWO YEARS AND PREPARING. FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE RIGHT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE READY TO START BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND GET OUR COMMUNITIES CONNECTED. IMMEDIATELY THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE TO. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX TO RURAL ELECTRIFICATION. GOOD GOOD- INFORMATION AND TIMELY IN THE SENSE THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENROLL A BIG INITIATIVE HERE- WITH THAT JUST I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS- THAT YOU HAVE DONE A PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES. RELATED TO. OUT WRONG WRONG PERSON. BUT I WILL BE ASKING THAT QUESTION AT THE LOS ANGELES PROP- PRODUCT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS HERE WE HAVE MEMBERS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO COMMITTEE SO WE'RE LOSING SOME PEOPLE HERE SO I APOLOGIZE- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NOT SEEN ANY WE WILL MOVE TO OUR NEXT WITNESS THAN WE HAVE KERRY ASK YOU BAILEY. WELCOME THANK YOU THAT MADAM CHAIRWOMAN IN MEMBERS IT IS AN HONOR TO REPRESENT CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS TODAY CHARTER IS A LEADING BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY COMPANY AND CABLE OPERATOR WE SERVE MORE THAN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS ACROSS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE WE EXPANDED OUR NETWORK TO REACH AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. WHERE AN OVERALL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND OUR NETWORK IS SUPPORTED BY JUST OVER EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES HERE IN THE STATE WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING LOCALLY AND ACROSS THE NATION AND ARE FORTY ONE STATE FOOTPRINT THE STATE'S BROADBAND EXPANSION EFFORTS HAVE ACTUALLY BANNED IN OUR OPINION FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL- ACCORDING TO THE FCC'S MOST RECENT DATA OVER TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. AND NOW WE REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS- IN CONNECTING MORE RURAL CALIFORNIANS A ONLY CONNECTING THESE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNSERVED CALIFORNIANS WILL REQUIRE A SUSTAINED PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP SINCE I'D CHARTER HAS BEEN AT AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE STATE'S BUILD OUT EFFORTS SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH THE CASTS OF PROGRAM WHICH WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TODAY- WE'VE PARTICIPATED IN MORE THAN SIXTEEN CATHOLIC INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROJECTS INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING THIRTEEN MILLION OF GRANT FUNDING FROM THIS PAST CYCLE ALONE. WE ALSO ASSIST STEEP IN IT. AT TO VERIFY THAT THERE ARE- THAT THEY ARE TRULY FOCUSING MONEY ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE DO THAT THROUGH THE CHALLENGE PROCESS IN KASA. IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CHALLENGE THAT CHARTER HAS SUBMITTED WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN HELPING THE P. YOU SEE- AND THAT'S EITHER THROUGH- RIGHT SIZING PROJECTS TO FOCUS ON UNSERVED AREAS OR THROUGH OTHER MEANS- JUST TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING PROCEEDING I'LL I'LL MOVE THAT UP TO THE FRONT OF THE COMMENTS HERE ON THE F. FEDERAL FUNDING TO COUNT MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM ACTUALLY HELPED CREATE THAT ACCOUNT AND IT REALLY DOES. PRESENT AND AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONNECT UNSERVED CALIFORNIANS BUT ONLY IF A WIDE VARIETY OF ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND- LET ME BE CLEAR AFTER REVIEWING. THE RED LINE CHANGES RELEASED YESTERDAY- IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT OUR COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM- WE BELIEVE THERE ARE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL- WE WOULD URGE THE P. YOU SEEK TO DELAY TOMORROW'S ACTION AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS AND REMOVE. THE BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION THAT WE SEE IN THE CURRENT DRAFT A HIGHLIGHT THREE OF THEM FOR YOU QUICKLY- FIRST OF ALL THE PROPOSED MANDATE FOR A GENERALLY AVAILABLE AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED EVEN TO WEALTHY CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. LOW COST PLAN AT SPEEDS OF FIFTY OVER FIFTY FOR FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR THE LIFE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE REPLACED. IT IS AN UNNECESSARY REQUIREMENT GIVEN CHARTER AND MANY OTHER. ALREADY OFFER TO PULL LOW COST PLANS AVAILABLE TO A BROAD GROUP OF HOUSEHOLDS. IN ADDITION CHARTER ALONG WITH MANY OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED MEGABITS DOWNLOAD SERVICE THAT WILL BE FREE TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT QUALIFY UNDER THE ACP PROGRAM. IF HERE'S CONCERN THAT THE PUBLIC IS NOT BENEFITING ENOUGH FROM THE ATP CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO FUND AN EXPANDED SUBSIDY FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLDS. IT IS MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC HAVE BROADBAND AVAILABLE THANKS MICROMANAGE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED AND FORCE DISCOUNTS BE MADE AVAILABLE TO WEALTHY HOUSEHOLDS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES. ON ENTITIES. THE SECOND THING THE CPUC NEEDS TO ADDRESS IS- WE WOULD ARGUE THEY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE EXISTING PASSIVE TWO YEAR PRICE FREEZE INSTEAD OF THE PROPOSED TEN YEAR CAP THAT WOULD IN FACT LIMIT PARTICIPANTS ABILITY TO SUPPORT NETWORK MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES CHARTER HAS A NATIONAL PRICING AND PACKAGING STRUCTURE CONSUMERS IN AREAS THAT HAVE LESS COMPETITION BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THAT MODEL AS IT IS ORIENTED TOWARD ENSURING OUR PRICES IN PACKAGING IT ARE COMPETITIVE IN THE MOST WELL SERVED AND COMPETITIVE MARKETS. AND THIRD WE BELIEVE IN CREATING THE STREAMLINED CHALLENGE PROCESS THE CPUC REALLY NEEDS TO BALANCE SPEED WITH ACCURACY WHILE ARGUABLY THE REDLINE- THAT WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY IS SOMEWHAT IMPROVED FROM THE INITIAL DRAFT WE STILL BELIEVE THE PROPOSED PROCESS IS OVERLY BURDENSOME AND WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FOCUS PUBLIC RESOURCES ON AREAS THAT LACKS. THIS IN THE VOLUME OF DOCUMENTATION THAT WILL BE REQUIRED WE THINK WILL TAKE LONGER TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE RATHER THAN ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF STREAMLINING. OUR BUILD OUT EXPERIENCE EXPANDING AND UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM HAS REVEALED INSIGHTS INTO THE CHALLENGES THAT CAN EXIST WITH LAST MILE CONNECTIVITY. WE OFTEN SAY THAT IN EVERY UNSERVED AREA THERE IS A STORY AND WHETHER THAT'S AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT SON SERVED A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S UNSERVED OR A DONUT HOLE THAT WAS SPOKEN OF BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS OFTEN NOT- ONE A STORY OF THE PROVIDERS MAKING. FOR EXAMPLE FOR OVER FOUR YEARS CHARTER TRIED TO NAVIGATE THE CALTRANS RIGHT OF WAY PERMITTING PROCESS TO REACH THE COMMUNITY OF ALL TERRORISTS IN MODOC COUNTY. RESIDENTS THERE COULD HAVE ENJOYED ACCESS TO OUR NATIONAL PACKAGING AND YOU THINK PUTTING BROADBAND SPEED OF UP TO A GAG UNFORTUNATELY AS I SIT HERE TODAY WE ARE NO CLOSER TO CONNECTING ALTURAS. IN OTHER INSTANCES WE ROAD WE RUN INTO ROAD BLOCKS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHERE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES ASK US TO BRING THEM SERVICE. AND YET WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THAT DEMAND DUE TO LENGTHY PERMITTING PROCESSES AND THE THESE. INSTANCES THOSE BUT IT'S FAR OVERSTEPPED THE IMPACTS ON ACCOUNT ACCESSING THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. IN ADDITION ARE FACING AN EVER CHANGING IT LITORIA ENVIRONMENT WITH EVER INCREASING REQUIREMENTS DOES CREATE BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY AND ACCIDENTS A DISINCENTIVE FOR GREATER INVESTMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN CHARTER BUILDS TO OR UPGRADES AN AREA WE DO SO TO THE WHOLE AREA DECISIONS ARE BASED ON THE COST TO BUILD AND THE DENSITY OF THE AREA NOT INCOME LEVELS WELL URBAN AND RURAL PROJECTS FACE THEIR OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES I WILL HIGHLIGHT AND NOTE THAT RURAL AREAS UNFORTUNATELY ARE OFTENTIMES SIMPLY MORE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO REACH- THEY AND BARBARA INVOLVED VAST. LARGER PROJECTS THEY HAVE MUCH LOWER POPULATION DENSITIES AND THEY DO REQUIRE GREATER OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FROM TECHNICIANS GIVEN THE LARGE GEOGRAPHIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ALSO MEANT REALLY MENTION REALLY QUICKLY THE NEED TO ATTACHED TO UTILITY POLES. MAYBE THE BEST OPTION BUT IT'S OFTEN A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF DELAY AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR URBAN AREA YOU MAY BE ABLE TO REACH TEN HOMES BY ATTACHING TO IT THANGAL ALL. IN OUR AREA THAT CAN BE FLIPPED LET'S HEAD AND IT COULD TAKE ATTACHING TO TENTPOLES TO REACH ONE HOME AND NOT PULL IT UP TO MY PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY. I THANK YOU FOR BEING US DEPART. DAY AND I WILL BEG YOUR INDULGENCE I DO HAVE ONE OF OUR REGULAR- EXPERT TOWARD FIRST HERE WITH IF WE- VERY TO AREAS MORE HIS EXPERTISE AND QUESTIONS I'LL ASK THAT HE- JOIN US. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY OFFENSIVE AND I THINK WE ALL CONTINUE TO LEARN ON THIS COMMITTEE- ALL OF THE EXTENSIVE PROCESSES AND SCOPE YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH- I WILL OPEN IT UPTO QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT- ALLOW THE MEMBERS. SO RELATED TO CHARTER THAN- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THESE GRANTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW IS- THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR THE GRANTS IN URBAN AREAS YOU DID HAVE A PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES TO CONNECT TO A TRAILER PARK SERVICE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW IT WOULD IDENTIFIED THAT AREA AS A PROJECT AND HOW WAS THAT THE NATION WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER AS WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN SOME OF THE- SENATE SOMETIMES- IF YOU WANT THE SAME UP HOMES THE CHOSEN NOT TO MOVE FORWARD YEAH SO WE YOU WILL. WE WILL NOTICE I MEAN ALL OF IT IS PUBLIC RIGHT- OUR FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WERE SOMEWHAT HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD MOBILE HOME PARKS OBVIOUSLY WE THOSE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE CONNECTED JUST LIKE ALL OF. BUT OF THAT WAS DUE TO CHALLENGES IDENTIFYING ELIGIBLE AREAS SO THE PRIOR ELIGIBILITY WAS SIX HAVE BUY ONE. SERVICE AND THE NEW ELIGIBILITY IS TWENTY FIVE BY THREE SO IT IT WE BELIEVE GOING FORWARD THERE WILL BE MORE AREAS THAT THAT WILL BE IDENTIFIED- WE DID HAVE TO RETURN SOME OF OUR GRANT OF FUNDS. BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS PROPERTY BASED ON RIGHT OF ENTRY WE CAN'T ACCESS PROPERTY UNLESS WE HAVE PERMISSION- AND IN A FEW INSTANCES IN THOSE MOBILE HOME PARKS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THAT WITH. THE PARK OWNERS SO IT IT CAN CREATE A BARRIER WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC PROPERTY WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES GOING ON AND- IN SOME AREAS AROUND PUBLIC PROPERTY AND CHALLENGES TRYING TO GET PERMISSION BUT BUT RIGHT OF ENTRY CAN BE AN ISSUE. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA JUST ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST LOOKING OUT MOBILE HOMES- ANY TYPE OF PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO ARE CONNECTED VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONNECTED. I DO NOT. THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE IF YOU WANT TO SAY SENIORS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THEIR YOUNG FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING AND SOME OF THESE BUT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR US TO RESEARCH. AND THEN ONE A QUESTION ABOUT CALAVERAS- WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO CRITICS WHO WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED IN BROADBAND- I WOULD SAY THAT. I WOULD I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE HAPPIER IF WE KNEW THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CONSERVE ALL THE PARTS CALIFORNIA BUT AS AS MISS BAILEY POINTED OUT. IT'S NOT LIKELY FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS SO WE COULD ASK THE SAME QUESTION WHY WOULD. NONPROFIT CLUBS BE PART OF ELECTRIFICATION. THE JOBS NEEDED TO HAPPEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS RURAL AND URBAN. AND SELL- UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO HAVE TO STEP INTO THIS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE GOOD PRACTICE AT PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE. ROADS PLAN MONEY FEDERAL STATE LOCAL MINING. WE BUILD FEDERAL THE HIGHWAYS YOU BUILD THE HOT YOU BILL THE STATE HIGHWAYS WE BUILD THE LOCAL ROADS AND WE LET. INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES RUN STOREFRONTS. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO OUR PEOPLE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BOULDERS- YES- MISS BAILEY WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE P. YOU SEE- OF THE PUC'S RULES ARE DISCOURAGING YOUR PARTICIPATION OF I MEAN I THINK WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED- IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY ARBITRARY. PRICE CAPS THAT BEN ARE FIXED IN TIME AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE MAY BE A WAIVER PROCESS I THINK YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT A LOOK AT THAT YESTERDAY- I THINK WE STILL. OBVIOUSLY IT IS A DISCRETIONARY IF YOU WILL SO THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT APPLYING FOR A WAIVER YOU'RE GOING TO GET ONE- WE ALSO THINK IN SOME WAYS IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFUSING PROCESS AND TORY COULD DRILL DOWN. ON DETAILS MORE IF YOU WOULD LIKE- BUT ALSO- I THINK WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW WITH THE BEAT PROGRAM ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S COMING DOWN YOU'RE SETTING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT PC IS ATTEMPTING TO SET. ONE PARAMETER WITH THIS BUCKET OF MONEY CAST IF ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING TWO YEAR PRICE FREEZE THAT WE THINK IS WORKING WELL THERE MAY BE SOME ROOM TO GO BETWEEN TWO YEAR AND TEN BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TWO YEAR AND THEN THIS BUCKET OF MONEY. IS GOING TO BE A TEN YEAR AND THEN. MAYBE THE STATE PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUTS TOGETHER THREE LEGISLATION HAS A DIFFERENT VISION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GO BACK TO THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY ISSUE AND- WHICH BUCKET ARE WE APPLYING FOR AND HOW AND HOW DO YOU. REGIONAL LIES THAT- AS A COMPANY- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S A CHALLENGE AND IT'S UNNECESSARY. BECAUSE COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE. LOW COST PROGRAMS IN THE MARKET PLACE AS I MENTIONED COMPANIES HAVE COMMITTED. TO ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH HIGHER SPEEDS FOR ACP QUALIFIED HOMES AND THE STATE ABSOLUTELY HAS THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THROUGH ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES IF. THE CONCERN IS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ON THE CUSP AND MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. MAY NEED A LITTLE HELP IT'S BETTER TO REALLY GO IN AND SURGICALLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THEN JUST CREATE THIS SWEEPING- MANDATE THAT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT- HIGHLY UNLIKELY I WILL SAY THAT COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. YEAH I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW- BALA TILE THE ECONOMY IS RIGHT NOW WITH INFLATION THAT IT WOULD BE SCARY FOR ANY BUSINESS TO. BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO A TENURE- PRICE FREEZE SO USING. DATA AND INFORMATION AND PROGRAMS ALREADY EXIST THAT WE KNOW SUCH AS MAYBE TO YOUR FEES WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK INTO DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO. FOR MONEY FROM- GONE SICKENING THREAT I WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME CONSTRAINTS IS A PRIVATE COMPANY DOES. WE DON'T HAVE TO RETURN HAVE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR INVESTORS. WE REPRESENT THE PUBLIC SO WE WILL RECEIVE THIS THIS BOND. ISSUE AND THAT IS FIXED PRICE SO WE ARE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP SO WITH THAT- I'M SORRY WAS THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A REVENUE BASE BOND YES SIR OKAY WELL THEN YOU GOT TO HAVE THE REVENUE TO PAY THE REVENUE BASE BOND THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON. ADOPTION AND ALL KINDS OF MARKET FACTORS AS WELL SO THERE'S A RISK THERE. YES SIR. WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE FROM PUBLIC COMMENT AND FIRST WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES.

HI MY NAME IS MARY BAGDASARIAN AND I'M WITH THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO LIGHT WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY DURING COLD IT HOW IMPORTANT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS AND- WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN MENTIONED BY OTHERS DURING THIS HEARING AND I'M HERE TO ASK THE COMMITTEE TO URGE THE CPUC TO DELAY ACTION REGARDING THE FAA RULES. DURING THEIR MEETING TOMORROW AND DOING ANY DECISION MAKING UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MEETING APRIL TWENTY FIRST TO GET STAKEHOLDERS MORE TIME TO ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THEY BRING OUT CURRENTLY WRITTEN. WHAT THEY ARE SET TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE ON TOMORROW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INHIBIT ACCESS OF BROADBAND TO THOSE IN OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS- BETTER CURRENTLY DRAFTED WITHIN THE RULES THEY'RE THE TWO THAT I WANT TO MAKE NOTE ON WHICH IS THE PROGRAM IS NOT LIMITED TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE THIS MEANS THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD BE POTENTIALLY EXPLOITED BY MULTI MILLIONAIRES. SO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MEANT FOR THERE FOR THOSE WHO THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT FOR WILL END UP SUBSIDIZING FOR EVERYONE ELSE IT SETS A TEN YEAR CAMP CAP AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ON THE PRICE OF ACCESS. FOR THE CPUC TO ARBITRARILY PUT A CAP WITHOUT LOOKING INTO THE FULL SCOPE OF SERVICE AND ACCESS WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AN ADJUSTMENT. IT WILL INCREASE THE COST IN HER ACCESS IT IS MEANT TO PROVIDE. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR NEEDS TODAY AND AGAIN I ASK YOU TO URGENCY PC TO DELAY ANY ACTION AND DECISION MAKING FOR THOSE JUST TWO MORE WEEKS.
