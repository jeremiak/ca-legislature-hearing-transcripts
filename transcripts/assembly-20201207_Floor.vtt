TAKENPUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.621
NEW HEIGHTS. THESE

ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE JUST ON THE

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.357

FIRST BECAME SPEAKER WE ARE OF

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:54.162

TOOK A DRAMATIC STEP FORWARD IN

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.532
THE FIELD OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:58.900
WE ENACTED A BILL TO LIMIT

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:01.403
POLICE USE OF FORCE. IN TWO

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.971
THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT WAS A

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.673
STRUGGLE TO GET THERE BUT I

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.775
THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE THAT

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:09.244
WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.046
WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH GOALS ON

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.014
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION THAT

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:13.782
PEOPLE ONCE THOUGHT WERE

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.584
IMPOSSIBLE. AND WE CREATED

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.953
MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW US TO

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:18.487
WORK TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:20.589
JUSTICE. OUR HOUSE WAS

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:21.890
INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.859
FUNDING FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.560
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE STOOD

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:26.862
TOGETHER TO PASS MORE

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.130
EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.699
EXPLOITED GIG WORKERS AND

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.834
OVERTIME FOR FARMWORKERS. THOSE

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.302
FARMWORKERS ARE STILL

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.571
CULTIVATING THE NATION'S FOOD

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:37.672
IN THE FACE OF HIGHER THAN

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:41.243
AVERAGE COVE INFECTION RATES.

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.511
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.479
RECOGNIZE THE WORK WE HAVE DONE

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.681
TO GET OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.682
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.518
CALIFORNIA NATION EMBRACE THE

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.286

OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:55.991
EXPLOITATION BY THOSE IN POWER.

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.292
THIS WAS A CALL FOR US TO

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.060
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PAST

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.496
OPERATIONS WERE NOT ENOUGH. TO

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.231

IN THE END WE CHANGED

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.005

INCLUSION CONSULTANT TO EXAMINE

THE ASSEMBLY IS POLICIES AND

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.185
PROCEDURES SO WE CAN ACHIEVE

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.087

HAVE BROUGHT COMPLETE EQUITY TO

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:40.528
OUR STATE. AND ALLOWED US TO

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:41.162
SOLVE THE POVERTY PUZZLE

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.864
CALIFORNIA BUT WE KNOW THAT'S

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.166
NOT THE CASE. WE KNOW THAT IN

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.701
THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES THE

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.937
ECONOMIC GAPS HAVE GROWN WIDER

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.005
IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:53.208
CALIFORNIA. NOW DESPITE A

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.644
BOOMING STOCK MARKET THOSE ARE

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.712
LOWER TIERS ARE STILL FACING AN

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.681
ECONOMIC STRUGGLE AS KOBE

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:02.450
DRIVES MORE AND MORE AND MORE

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.286
CALIFORNIANS TO OUR PROPERTY. A

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.121
QUARTER MILLION AMERICANS HAVE

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.490
DIED FROM CODED IN CALIFORNIA

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:12.727
THE TOTAL STANDS ABOUT TWENTY

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:13.561
THOUSAND. IT IS TRUE THAT THE

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.497
LAST TIME WE MET IN SACRAMENTO

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.798
IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY BACK

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.466
IN AUGUST WE WERE ALREADY

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.168
FACING THE NEW AND TERRIBLE

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.970
DEMANDS PRESENTED BY A GLOBAL

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:25.407
PANDEMIC. THE PAST FEW MONTHS

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.775
AWAY FROM SACRAMENTO HAVE GIVEN

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:29.010
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROCESS

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:31.079
THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING UNDER

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:33.415
PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. I WILL

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:35.183
ASK YOU TODAY TO USE THAT

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.652
EXPERIENCE TO FOCUS THIS BODIES

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.155
VISION FOR THE FUTURE. THOSE OF

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.222
YOU WHO ARE NEW TO THE ASSEMBLY

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:43.925
CONGRADULATIONS YOU WILL NOW

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.493
HELP US TO FACE THAT CHALLENGE.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.995
WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:49.030
LEGISLATE COBIT AWAY BUT WE CAN

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.765
USE CO THAT IS A LENDS FOR

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.467
CHANGING THE WAY WE LOOK AT HOW

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:55.070
WE LEGISLATE. AS A RESULT OF

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.971
CODE WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:59.074
THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS I

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.142
NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN DIRE

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:01.676
CIRCUMSTANCES FROM BEING

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.012
EVICTED. WE'VE SEEN A NEED TO

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:05.814
PROVIDE GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.849
BENEFITS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.918
WE'VE SEEN AN UPSURGE IN RACIAL

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.953
TENSIONS AND BIGOTRY. AS

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.888
SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION ARE

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.824
UNFAIRLY SINGLED OUT AND

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.259
IGNORANTLY BLAMED FOR STARTING

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.695
OR SPREADING THE VIRUS. AND

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.364
WE'VE SEEN A NEED TO PROTECT

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.666
EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S HOUSE. IN

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.134
ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.136
THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE SEEN THE

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:31.206
VIRUS AMPLIFIED LONG STANDING

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.507
HEALTH DISPARITIES AND

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.509
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.911
NATIVE AMERICANS BLACKS LATINOS

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:39.414
NATIVE HAWAIIAN. AND PACIFIC

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:41.416
ISLANDERS. CARBON SHOULD

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.650
TEACHERS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:45.720
LACK OF ECONOMIC MEANS IS NOT

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.689
THE SAME AS A LACK OF CHARACTER.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:50.158
NOW MORE THAN EVER LET US

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.327
REMEMBER THE SOCIAL CONTRACT.

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:54.129
IT SHOULD INFORM HOW WE BEHAVE

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:57.232
AT ALL TIMES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.534
BE UNITED AGAINST POVERTY AT

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.035
ALL TIMES NOT JUST WHEN WE'RE

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:04.272
AT WAR WITH CODE. SOON THERE

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:05.473
WILL BE A KEY CHANGE THAT WE

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.575
CAN COUNT ON I BELIEVE IN OUR

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.778
FAVOR THAT IS THE UPCOMING

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:10.178
CHANGE OF FEDERAL

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.814
ADMINISTRATIONS. ALTHOUGH THERE

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.315
WILL SURELY BE A DISAGREEMENT

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:15.884
FROM A FEW OF OUR COLLEAGUES I

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.951
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.620
VERY GOOD CHANGE FOR EVERY

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.822
DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.557
BE A REMARKABLE THING TO HAVE A

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:25.226
CALIFORNIAN ADVOCATING FOR US.

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:27.128
A CALIFORNIA WHO HAS EXPERIENCE

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.997
IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND HAS

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:30.799
ALREADY WORKED ON OUR BEHALF

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:32.934
AND CONGRESS. SHE IS A

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.369
CALIFORNIAN WHO REPRESENTS THE

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.070
RICHEST OF OUR DIVERSE NATION

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:38.106
SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN THE FIRST

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.841
AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THE FIRST

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.476
SOUTH ASIAN VICE PRESIDENT IN

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:45.680
US HISTORY. FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.449
THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT TO THE

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.884
WHITE HOUSE. I URGE US TO STAY

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.152
FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:54.556
CALIFORNIA. IT WAS BY FOCUSING

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:55.657
ON THE ISSUES THROUGH OUR

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:56.958
PRISON THAT I SAID WE COULD

01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.595
SUCCEED. FOCUSING ON CALIFORNIA

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.964
REMAINS THE RIGHT STRATEGY THIS

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.265
TIME WE WILL NOT FACE

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.900
OPPOSITION AT EVERY STEP WHEN

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:07.802
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THE

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:08.670
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS CARE

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.405
ABOUT. THINGS LIKE CLIMATE

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.874
CHANGE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AT

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.310
ALL LEVELS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.045
WOMEN'S RIGHTS HEALTH CARE FAIR

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:19.047
TREATMENT FOR IMMIGRANTS. BUT

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:20.548
WE STILL NEED TO IDENTIFIED

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.550
CALIFORNIA'S PRIORITIES AND WE

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.519
WILL STILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:25.119
THOSE PRIORITIES TO THE WHITE

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:27.288
HOUSE. PRESIDENT BIDEN OF

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:29.491
COURSE WILL HAVE MANY MORE

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.358
PEOPLE SEEKING HIS HERE BESIDE

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:32.560
US. I'M EANWHILE INTENT TO

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:34.629
CONTINUE LISTENING TO YOU AS WE

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:37.398
CHART OUR COURSE. I THINK

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.334
INTENDED TO CONTINUE INSURING

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.036
THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS HAVE POWER

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.506
TO PURSUE THEIR POLICY GOALS.

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.541
SIX S. IN THE COMING SESSION

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:47.108
WILL DEPEND ON THAT

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.677
COLLABORATION BUT WILL ALSO

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:50.545
TAKE A FOCUS ON SOME KEY

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:53.248
ISSUES. ONE OF THOSE ISSUES

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.550
THIS POLICE TO CERTIFICATION.

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.185
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OUR

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:59.120
DRIVE TO MAKE PUBLIC SAFETY IN

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.155
CALIFORNIA TRULY ABOUT THE

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:03.558
SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC KNOCKED

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:05.693
OUT OF ANY SPECIAL INTEREST.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.563
YOU AND I DO NOT HAVE IMMUNITY

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.230
FOR OUR BEHAVIOR OUR

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:12.300
MISBEHAVIOR. IN FACT WE ARE

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.402
UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY. BRITNEY

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:15.904
IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.071
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS WHO

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.606
CALIFORNIANS TRUST WITH OUR

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:21.376
LIVES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.378
THEY DO NOT HAVE IMMUNITY FOR

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.413
THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS I'M NOT

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.714
TALKING ABOUT MISTAKES I'M

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.082
TALKING ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:30.885
MISDEEDS. POLICE TO

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.020
CERTIFICATION IS ABOUT

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:34.322
PROTECTING GOOD PEOPLE FROM BAD

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:36.157
BEHAVIOR AND WE NEED TO SEE

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.326
THAT POLICY ENACTED IN THE

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:41.396
CURRENT SESSION. CALIFORNIA

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.264
ALSO MUST BUILD ON THE WORK

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:44.265
THAT WE'RE DOING ON CLIMATE

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.534
CHANGE THERE IS NO QUESTION

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:47.969
THAT WE ARE ALREADY A NATIONAL

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.537
LEADER WITH AMBITIOUS PLANS TO

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:50.805
CONDUCT CONTROLLED GREENHOUSE

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.874
GAS EMISSIONS. AND CHANGE THE

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:55.376
MODELS FOR OUR ENERGY ECONOMY

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.912
BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. I WANTED

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.714
TO PUSH HARDER TO KEEP THAT

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.683
PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD. THIS

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:02.917
IS SOMETHING MADE EVEN MORE

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:05.887
URGENT BY ANOTHER RECORD

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:07.589
BREAKING YEAR OF WILDFIRES.

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:09.057
THOSE FIRES PUT IMMENSE

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.059
QUANTITIES OF CARBON INTO THE

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:11.659
ATMOSPHERE THAT'S TRUE WE KNOW

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:13.995
THAT. SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.697
HEARD ME POINT OUT THAT IT IS

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:18.499
NOT AN EXCUSE TO RELAX ON

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.033
GREENHOUSE GASES CAUSED BY

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.203
HUMANS. NEGLECTING THE IMPACTS

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:23.838
VEHICLES AND FACTORIES AND

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.107
ENERGY GENERATION CREATED THAT

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.042
NIGHTMARES FIRE CONDITIONS WE

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:30.411
EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.379
OUR MISSION TO RAISE

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:32.847
TEMPERATURES AND WRECKED HAVOC

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:36.250
WITH RAINFALL TOO LITTLE HERE

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.919
TOO MUCH IN HURRICANE REGIONS.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:40.555
MORE DISASTER IS INEVITABLE IF

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:44.225
WE DON'T CONTROL EMISSIONS. IT

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.493
MAY BE TRUE THAT WE CANNOT

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.028
SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTING

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.097
ALONE IN CALIFORNIA BUT DON'T

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:52.133
FORGET CALIFORNIANS ARE LEADERS

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.168
SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:55.503
CALIFORNIA GOVERNORS AND

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.105
LEGISLATORS OF BOTH PARTIES

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.640
HAVE CREATED SOLUTIONS FOR

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.775
CLEAN AIR AND WATER. OTHER

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:03.111
STATES A NATIONAL MINISTRATIONS

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:03.611
HAVE FOLLOWED AND SO HAS

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.880
INDUSTRY. THERE IS SOMETHING

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.181
ELSE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.650
MODEL AND THAT IS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:11.219
JUSTICE. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:28:11.285 --> 01:28:12.854
MEANS TWO THINGS FIRST IT MEANS

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.422
THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.391
BENEFIT ALL COMMUNITIES. AND

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.692
THAT WE'RE DEVOTING EQUAL

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:18.960
ATTENTION TO POLLUTION AND

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.395
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.863
PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.766
BENEFITS LIKE PARKS AND TRAILS

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:25.266
AND BIKE PATHS IN THOSE

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.468
COMMUNITIES. SECOND

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.536
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MEANS

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.304
THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:32.807
GREEN INDUSTRY ACCRUE TO THOSE

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:35.176
WHO NEED THE MOST. AS WE

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.045
LEGISLATE TO MOVE TO A CLEANER

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:39.580
ECONOMY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:40.948
ECONOMIC INEQUALITY DOES NOT

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:44.619
GROW. CALIFORNIA CAN NOT PUT

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.287
THE BRAKES ON CARBON GENERATING

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.455
INDUSTRIES WITHOUT HAVING A

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:48.990
STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.591
CALIFORNIA'S WORKING IN THOSE

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:55.997
INDUSTRIES. LIKEWISE. WHY WHY

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.165
DO WE NEED TO GUARANTEE THAT

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:58.533
THE PEOPLE OF LOWER INCOME

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:00.702
DISTRICTS LIKE MINE ARE

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:02.136
BENEFICIARIES OF CALIFORNIANS

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.705
INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:06.174
SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO RAISE

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.710
THOSE INEQUITIES BOTH IN JOBS

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.745
AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. I

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:13.081
HAVE A THIRD GOAL A GOAL THAT I

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:13.715
KNOW WE SHARED WITH OTHERS IN

01:29:13.781 --> 01:29:16.751
THIS ROOM. AND ACTIVISTS THAT'S

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:17.285
THE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:21.789
SERVICES. OUR WORLD TODAY IS

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.357
DEPENDENT ON THE INTERNET

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:25.326
PROBABLY MORE THAN EVER

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.061
DEPENDED ON TELEPHONE SERVICE.

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:28.863
AS WE RETREATED TO OUR HOUSES

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.331
TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF CARE OF

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.066
THE PEOPLE BECAME DEPENDENT ON

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.168
HOME ACCESS FOR EVERY FACET OF

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:36.270
THEIR LIVES. WE SAW UNEVEN

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.239
DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNET ACCESS

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.241
WHEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:41.042
WERE ABLE TO GET ONLINE

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.444
INSTRUCTION. WE SAW THAT ACCESS

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.513
WAS NOT UNIVERSAL WHEN PEOPLE

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.315
IN WILDFIRE REGIONS WERE UNABLE

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:48.816
TO GET EMERGENCY UPDATES THAT

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.185
WERE LITERALLY MATTERS OF LIFE

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.888
AND DEATH. THIS IS NOT JUST A

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:56.090
QUESTION OF RICH AND POOR. ANY

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.792
OF OUR RURAL CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.227
UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THIS

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:00.661
UTILITY THAT PROVIDES

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:02.630
INFORMATION EDUCATION

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.333
ENTERTAINMENT MEDICAL ACCESS

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:07.368
AND WILDFIRE INFORMATION.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.504
CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLE HUB FOR

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.639
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND YET MANY OF

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.641
OUR RESIDENTS FIND THEMSELVES

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.476
LEFT OUT OF BASIC INTERNET

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.645
ACCESS. WE NEED TO TACKLE

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.881
EXPANSION OF BROADBAND ACCESS

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.582
NOW IT HAS TO HAPPEN THIS

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:24.418
SESSION. THESE ARE ALL

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:26.320
CALIFORNIA PRIORITIES THEY'RE

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.789
THE THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE OF

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:30.558
THIS STATE NEEDS. I'M ALSO

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:31.459
MINDFUL OF THE CHALLENGES WE

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.694
FACE. WE COULD TALK OVER THE

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.263
BARRIER TO GETTING WORK DONE WE

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:37.231
COULD CALL CODED AND IT'S- THE

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.667
ATTENDANT. FISCAL SITUATION AS

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:42.170
A BARRIER TO GETTING WORK DONE

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:44.172
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT.

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:46.507
THEY ARE SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.775
FOR CERTAIN BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.277
GREATER THAN THE CHALLENGES

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.945
CALIFORNIANS HAVE FACED

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.814
THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. OUR

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.015
CHALLENGES INCLUDED THOSE OF

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.117
NATIVE THE NATIVE AMERICANS WHO

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.185
SUFFER FROM DISEASE AND

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.653
MASSACRES. THEY INCLUDED THE

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.188
CHALLENGES OF SOUTHEAST ASIANS

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.756
WHO FLED VIOLENCE LIKE MY WIFE

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.891
AND HIS FAMILY OR WORKING CLASS

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.960
MEXICAN SEEKING OPPORTUNITY

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:07.695
LIKE MY OWN FAMILY. WE HAVE

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.497
BUILT. TODAY'S CALIFORNIA

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.299
COLLECTIVELY BY FACING THOSE

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:14.235
CHALLENGES. I AM CONFIDENT WE

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.704
CAN FACE TODAY'S CHALLENGES.

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:17.305
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.340
DO EVEN MORE. I WILL NOT TAKE

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.309
COVIDIEN ARE UNCERTAIN REVENUE

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:23.711
PICTURE AS AN EXCUSE TO SAY WE

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.746
HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.415
FEWER RESOURCES WITH FEWER

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.283
OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN THE

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.586
STATE HAS LESS THAT'S A TIME

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:34.722
WHEN PEOPLE HURT. MOST THAT'S

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:35.990
THE TIME WHEN WE HAVE TO DO

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.259
MORE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.094
POSSIBLE IF WE MAKE THEM OUR

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.096
PRIORITY INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:45.066
WHAT'S LEFT OVER. I THINK WE'RE

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:47.034
MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. WE

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:48.903
THOUGHT WHEN WE PASSED ONE OF

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:51.105
THE MOST DIFFICULT BUDGETS IN A

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.608
