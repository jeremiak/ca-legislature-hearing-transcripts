COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THE FIRST

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.097
EXAMPLE IS THAT THIS BILL

IMPLEMENTS A FULL PROGRAM FOR

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.968

TRADITIONAL FOR WILL PROGRAM.

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:01.004
THIS BILL COMPENSATES STATE

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.539

EMPLOYEE'S NAME. THE THAT WE

IT'S PAID OUT AT THEIR HIGHEST

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.456
SALARY NOT AT THE SALARY AT

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.658
WHICH HE WAS GRANTED. SO THIS

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:23.226
IS IN EFFECT NOT A COST SAVINGS

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:24.494
TO THE STATE BUT A HIGH

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:26.096
pINTEREST ALONE AT THAT WE ARE

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:28.365

RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING. CAN BE

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.271
FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THIS

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.307
TRAILER BILL SUSPENDS. THE

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:39.743
EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION FOR POST

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:42.212
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR A

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:42.879
NUMBER OF STATE BARGAINING

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:45.048

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.750
WE HAVE A HUGE UNFUNDED STATE

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:52.489
LIABILITY. KHLOE RETIREE HEALTH

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:54.591

MILLION WITH AN M. OUT OF THE

GENERAL FUND. BUT I FEAR THAT

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.545
IT WILL CAUSE FAR GREATER HARM

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.447

CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:27.121
THE FIRST THING TO NOTE ABOUT

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.856
THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT IT'S

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.292

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.695
THIRD AFTER THE ASSEMBLY HAS

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.364

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.966
FIFTEEN WEEKS. A PROXY OR

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:40.968

WE DO IT MONTHS AGO SO WE COULD

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:44.105
HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.740
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS WHOLE

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:48.910
TIME. INSTEAD FOR TWELVE OF THE

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:50.578

RUN THIS CAPITAL. WE DIDN'T

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.319
MEET IN ANY MANNER AT ALL. WE

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.789
DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO WHY IS IT

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:02.924
THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING THIS NOW

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.358
WILL ONE ANSWER WAS ALLUDED TO

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:08.296

EIGHT TWENTY FIVE DIDN'T MAKE

WAY TO ESTABLISH PROXY VOTING

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:15.102
IF WE'RE GONNA DO IT. WAS A

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.971
REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE SENATE

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.072
AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE HOUSE

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.808
RESOLUTION. REQUIRES NEITHER OF

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:23.578
THOSE THINGS. IT'S HARD TO

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.346
IMAGINE A MORE WILLFUL

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:27.715
VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.684
BY THIS BODY BUT YOU DON'T NEED

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.952

SACRAMENTO BEE ON APRIL SIXTH

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:37.525
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:40.027
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WITH

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:42.330

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.304
THE CONSTITUTION NECESSITATES

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.806
THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF

01:31:51.873 --> 01:31:53.875

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:55.877
RIGHT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ATTEND

THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS IN

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.281
PERSON. THIS IS BEEN A LONG

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:01.816
STANDING OPINION OF OUR

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.618
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.453
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:07.955
REQUIRES PHYSICAL PRESENCE FOR

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.023
LEGISLATOR VOTING AND THAT

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.792
POSITION WAS AFFIRMED IN A MAY

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.728
ELEVENTH OPINION BY THE

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.363
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. WHICH SAID

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:16.497
THAT VIRTUALLY ALL THE

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:17.965
PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE FOUR OF

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:19.967
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.536
ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACT

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:23.504
BY MEANS OF PHYSICALLY

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.374
CONVENING MEMBERS IN THE SAME

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.343
PLACE. AT THE SAME TIME. SO

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.978
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.647
PASS THIS RESOLUTION AND

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:35.249
PROCEED WITH PROXY VOTING WELL

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.417
THAT'S GOING TO CAST A CLOUD.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.119
OF UNCERTAINTY OVER EVERY

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:39.520
SINGLE BILL THAT WE PASSED

01:32:39.587 --> 01:32:41.155
BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.424
SESSION. AND AGAIN YOU DON'T

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.626
NEED TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT.

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:46.327
POLITICO REPORTED ON APRIL

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.696
THIRTIETH. THAT THE ASSEMBLY

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:51.399
SPEAKERS OFFICE. FEELS THERE'S

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:51.966
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF RISK THE

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.601
POSSIBILITY OF A LAWSUIT

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.736
CHARGING THE REMOTE NOTES

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.305
VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. IF

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:58.806
SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR FILED AND

01:32:58.873 --> 01:32:59.807
PREVAILED RENDON'S OFFICE

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.610
REASONS LAWS PASSED REMOTELY

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:04.145
COULD BE THROWN OUT. AS IF

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.079
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.815
UNCERTAINTY AHEAD OF US IN THE

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.517
COMING MONTHS. HAVING

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.485
POTENTIALLY DOZENS OR HUNDREDS

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.587
OF BILLS WITH AN UNCERTAIN

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:15.756
LEGAL STATUS IS SOMETHING OF

01:33:15.823 --> 01:33:16.324
THAT OUR STATE SIMPLY CANNOT

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:19.493
AFFORD. BUT MY BIGGEST

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.495
OBJECTION TO THIS PROPOSAL. IS

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:22.763
THE PROXY VOTING IS SIMPLY

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:27.301
INCOMPATIBLE WITH.

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:27.902
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT AND

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:28.436
THIS AGAIN IS PART OF OUR

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:29.036
LEGISLATOR COUNCILS MAY

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.304
ELEVENTH OPINION WHICH STATES

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:30.938
NOT ONLY DOES REMOTE

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.807
LEGISLATING CONTRADICT THE

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.475
COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:35.876
WORDS USED IN THE CONSTITUTION

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.812
BUT IT RUNS COUNTER TO HOW

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:39.580
DELIVERED OF BODIES HAVE A

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.816
STORE HISTORICALLY BEEN

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.217
UNDERSTOOD. TO OPERATE.

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:44.852
CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:45.886
LEAST REPRESENTATIVE

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.655
LEGISLATURE BY ANY MEASURE IN

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:50.758
THE COUNTRY. PROXY VOTING WOULD

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:53.094
DO AWAY WITH THE ONE THING THAT

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.929
KEEPS US A DEMOCRACY IN MORE

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.598
THAN JUST NAME. WHEN YOU HAVE

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:58.766
PROXY VOTING THERE'S NO

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.901
OPPORTUNITY FOR DEBATE FOR

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:02.770
DELIBERATION TO HAVE YOUR MIND

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.872
CHANGED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.140
POINTS OF VIEW THE VOTE. IS PRE

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.909
COOKED. HERE'S WHAT THE

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.578
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.780
FOR THE ACLU SAYS. THIS IS ONE

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.715
OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:16.851
HAVE TO ASK IF THE CURE IS

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.652
WORSE THAN THE DISEASE WHAT

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.521
DOES IT MEAN TO OPEN THE DOOR

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.456
TO SUCH DRAMATIC DEPARTURES FOR

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:23.724
MORE DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATIC

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:27.561
TRADITIONS. AND IS IT WORTH IT.

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:30.364
NOW I FEEL FOR THE MEMBERS WHO

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.234
CANNOT BE WITH US. BECAUSE OF

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.236
ALL OUR ABILITY TO THIS VIRUS.

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.438
IT'S A LOSS FOR THEM IT'S A LOS

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.672
THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT IT IS NO

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.508
MORE OF THE LOS THEN

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.209
LEGISLATORS WHO FOR A CENTURY

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:44.078
AND A HALF AND HAD TO MISS

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.913
SESSIONS BECAUSE OF INJURY.

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:48.382
ILLNESS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:50.351
THIRTY SECONDS. AT THE END OF

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.986
THE DAY ARE VOTES ARE NOT OUR

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.588
PERSONAL PROPERTY. THEY'RE NOT

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:56.891
TRANSFERABLE THEY'RE NOT OURS

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.526
TO GIVE AWAY THE VOTES ON THAT

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.194
BOARD DON'T BELONG TO US. THEY

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:03.197
BELONG TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:04.131
WHOLE IDEA. OF POPULAR

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.333
SOVEREIGNTY. WE ARE MERE

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.170
STANDINGS. BUT THAT REQUIRES US

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:11.439
TO ACTUALLY STAND IN AND IF WE

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:13.574
DON'T THEN THE ENTIRE CONCEPT

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.076
OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:17.278
BREAKS DOWN SO I ASK YOU. TO

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:17.978
USE THE VOTE THAT'S BEEN

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:20.548
ENTRUSTED TO YOU TODAY TO MAKE

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:22.550
SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THE

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:25.453
FIGURES KILEY SAYING NO

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.555

JUST SAY THAT THE COURTS HAVE

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:39.633
CONSISTENTLY RECOGNIZED THAT

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.502
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE SOLE

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.403
AUTHORITY TO GOVERN ITS

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.772
