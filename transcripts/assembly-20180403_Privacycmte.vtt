PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:27.592 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO BASIS

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:30.028 region:rollup2
FOR ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SEXUAL

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:32.130 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION FOR FOUR MAIN

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:33.765 region:rollup2
REASONS. FIRST THAT SAME SEX

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.700 region:rollup2
ATTRACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ARE

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:36.835 region:rollup2
NOT A FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.403 region:rollup2
REQUIRING TREATMENT.

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:40.472 region:rollup2
SECONDLY THAT SO CALLED

00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:42.540 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY IS NOT REALLY

00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:44.009 region:rollup2
A LEGITIMATE FORM OF THERAPY

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.310 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:46.644 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.813 region:rollup2
IT.

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:50.982 region:rollup2
THREE THAT THESE METHODS POSE A

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:53.551 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM TO THE

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:55.353 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THAT THERE

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.888 region:rollup2
ARE NUMEROUS FERRIC UNIQUELY

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:58.657 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE METHODS FOR

00:35:56.888 --> 00:36:00.992 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS. OF

00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:03.194 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE QUESTIONING THEIR

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:05.096 region:rollup2
SEARCH SEXUAL ORIENTATION

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:06.498 region:rollup2
WITHOUT RESORTING TO CONVERSION

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:08.433 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:09.701 region:rollup2
FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I HAVE

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:11.803 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND WRITTEN

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:12.771 region:rollup2
POLICY IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:15.273 region:rollup2
HAVING MAINTAINED A CLINICAL

00:36:12.771 --> 00:36:17.175 region:rollup2
PRACTICE. THAT INCLUDED HUNDREDS

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:19.678 region:rollup2
OF BOYS AND MEN WHO HAD GOT

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:21.413 region:rollup2
UNDERGONE SOME FORM OF SO CALLED

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:23.114 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY INCLUDING

00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:25.216 region:rollup2
AVERSIVE INTERVENTIONS

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:27.519 region:rollup2
SUCH AS GENERAL ELECTRIC SHOCK

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:29.954 region:rollup2
AND NAUSEA INDUCING DRUGS.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:31.656 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL METHODS

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:34.092 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENTS INVOLVING

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:37.062 region:rollup2
FORCED ISOLATION FROM FAMILIES

00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:38.029 region:rollup2
HUMILIATION AND SO FORTH.

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:40.031 region:rollup2
NONE OF THESE METHODS WERE

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:42.967 region:rollup2
AFFECTED IT CHANGING ONE SEXUAL

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:45.236 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION AND IN FACT USUALLY

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:46.638 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED THE PERSON'S ALREADY

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:48.206 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL GUILT AND SELF

00:36:46.638 --> 00:36:49.574 region:rollup2
LOATHING.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:51.409 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DOCUMENT ALL

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:52.544 region:rollup2
OF THE HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:54.446 region:rollup2
THESE METHODS THAT I HAVE

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:55.013 region:rollup2
OBSERVED OVER THE YEARS IN SHORT

00:36:54.446 --> 00:36:57.315 region:rollup2
TIME. BUT ONE PATIENT STANDS

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:58.716 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:00.051 region:rollup2
WHO WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:01.486 region:rollup2
GUILT FOR HIS INABILITY TO

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.921 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:04.823 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE GRIEF THAT CAME

00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:06.991 region:rollup2
FROM HAVING BEEN OSTRACIZED BY

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:08.059 region:rollup2
HIS FAMILY AND COMMUNITY? THAT

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.095 region:rollup2
HE STRUGGLED WITH CHRONIC

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:13.131 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:14.499 region:rollup2
AND SUICIDAL IDEATION FOR YEARS.

00:37:13.131 --> 00:37:16.267 region:rollup2
WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:18.203 region:rollup2
TRIED SO HARD TO CHANGE TWO

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:20.638 region:rollup2
YEARS HE REPLIED

00:37:18.203 --> 00:37:22.407 region:rollup2
QUOTE. IN MY WORLD I FELT IT WAS

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:24.109 region:rollup2
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO STAY

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:25.577 region:rollup2
ALIVE.

00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WHAT I'M LIVING NOW

00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:29.380 region:rollup2
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE MUCH OF A

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:31.049 region:rollup2
LIFE.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.550 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO CHANGE SEXUAL

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:34.886 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION DON'T WORK AND THEY

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.421 region:rollup2
POSE SUBSTANTIAL RISK

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:39.457 region:rollup2
TO VULNERABLE PERSONS

00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:42.160 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY CPA BELIEVES THAT IT

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:43.027 region:rollup2
IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.229 region:rollup2
IN FACT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:46.831 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE TO ACCURATELY

00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:49.200 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THESE PRACTICES AS

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.335 region:rollup2
CONSUMER FRAUD. PLACING SUCH

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.036 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONSUMER

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:53.838 region:rollup2
LEGAL REMEDIES ACT SERVES TO PUT

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:55.140 region:rollup2
THE PURVEYORS OF CONVERSION

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:56.608 region:rollup2
THERAPIES ON NOTICE.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.675 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER GET AWAY

00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:59.310 region:rollup2
WITH MARKETING THESE DANGEROUS

00:37:57.675 --> 00:38:00.912 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.514 region:rollup2
BUT IT SERVES ANOTHER EQUALLY

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:04.949 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FUNCTION

00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:08.086 region:rollup2
SENDING A MESSAGE TO LGBT AND

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:09.220 region:rollup2
QUESTIONING PERSONS OF ALL AGES.

00:38:08.086 --> 00:38:10.955 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.123 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:13.858 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA ONCE AND FOR ALL TO

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:17.162 region:rollup2
PUT AN END TO THESE DECEPTIVE

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:19.764 region:rollup2
AND DANGEROUS PRACTICES. I THANK

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:01.206 region:rollup2
I SHARE ALL OF THIS FOR THE

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.974 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF EMPHASIZING THAT I'VE

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
BEEN LIFELONG COMMITTED TO THE

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:07.345 region:rollup2
METHOD AS IT'S APPLIED TO HUMAN

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:09.147 region:rollup2
NATURE.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:10.849 region:rollup2
YET IN SPITE OF MY SCIENTIFIC

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:13.818 region:rollup2
LIFE RESUME I AM SORRY I'M

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:15.286 region:rollup2
FRANKLY EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:15.787 region:rollup2
I WAS SUCKED IN AND DO. BY THE

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:18.656 region:rollup2
CHARLATANS OF CONVERSION

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:19.924 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:21.292 region:rollup2
AS A YOUNG MAN I GREW UP WITH

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:22.961 region:rollup2
THE CLOSE FAMILY CONNECTION TO

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:25.463 region:rollup2
MY PARENTS AND MY SIBLINGS.

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:28.600 region:rollup2
HOWEVER CONVERSION THERAPISTS

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:29.934 region:rollup2
SHATTERED THESE RELATIONSHIPS.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.768 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPIST TOLD ME

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:33.137 region:rollup2
THAT MY PARENTS WERE AT FAULT

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:34.072 region:rollup2
FOR MY HOMOSEXUAL NATURE THIS IN

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:35.073 region:rollup2
MY FATHER FAILED ME BY BEING TOO

00:39:34.072 --> 00:39:36.608 region:rollup2
DISTANT MY MOTHER FAMILY BY

00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:38.042 region:rollup2
BEING TOO CLOSE.

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:40.378 region:rollup2
AT A TIME MY LIFE WHEN I NEEDED

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:41.880 region:rollup2
MORE THAN EVER TO RUN TOWARD.

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:43.014 region:rollup2
AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEM

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.982 region:rollup2
THAT MY FAMILY COULD HAVE

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:45.583 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO ME.

00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:47.785 region:rollup2
I WAS INSTEAD ADMINISTERED

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:49.120 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL POISON.

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.855 region:rollup2
AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FEEL OUTRAGE

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.657 region:rollup2
HOSTILITY AND ANGER TOWARD MY

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:54.559 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS FOR SUPPOSEDLY

00:39:52.657 --> 00:39:55.560 region:rollup2
MAKING ME GAY.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.195 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LIES OF

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.030 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY.

00:39:57.195 --> 00:40:02.500 region:rollup2
I BECAME FILLED WITH BITTERNESS

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.134 region:rollup2
TOWARD MY PARENTS MY FAMILY OF

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.269 region:rollup2
BITTERNESS AT A STRANGE TO US.

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:05.703 region:rollup2
BUT MULTIPLIED OUR SORROWS

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:07.338 region:rollup2
AND THE PUSHED ME FURTHER AND

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:09.140 region:rollup2
FURTHER INTO THE DARK NIGHT OF

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:10.375 region:rollup2
PATHOLOGICAL LONELINESS

SIXTH GRADE ON I LIVED IN

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:30.688 region:rollup2

TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.559 region:rollup2
OLD AND IT WAS DURING THAT TIME

00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:37.128 region:rollup2
I STRUGGLED WITH SAME SEX

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:39.096 region:rollup2
ATTRACTION AND.

00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:39.597 region:rollup2

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:46.871 region:rollup2
EMBRACE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:49.740 region:rollup2
MY OWN SENSE OF WELL BEING

00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:52.043 region:rollup2
DECLINE AS I FOUND PEOPLE TO

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.544 region:rollup2
SUPPORT MY HOMOSEXUAL DESIRE MY

00:46:52.043 --> 00:46:56.547 region:rollup2
HOMOSEXUAL IDENTITY.

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:58.449 region:rollup2
I FELT LESS STABLE THAN PRIOR.

00:46:56.547 --> 00:47:00.318 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:01.919 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO

00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:03.254 region:rollup2
RESTORED HOPE WHICH IRAN NOW I'M

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:05.256 region:rollup2

THAT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.966 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES DEALING WITH

UNWANTED.

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:19.770 region:rollup2
SAME SEX ATTRACTION.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:21.906 region:rollup2
THEN I FIND THAT TO BE A SUBSET

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.474 region:rollup2
OF THE OVERALL GLBT COMMUNITY

00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:24.909 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:27.411 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO

00:47:24.909 --> 00:47:27.878 region:rollup2
ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THEIR OWN

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:29.980 region:rollup2
SAME SEX ATTRACTION.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:31.949 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.018 region:rollup2
SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF WITNESSES

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:35.553 region:rollup2
THAT SAY YOU MUST EMBRACE THIS

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.188 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL DESPONDENT. AND

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:39.690 region:rollup2
SUICIDAL.

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:41.692 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD THREE SUCH INDIVIDUALS

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.361 region:rollup2
RECENTLY COME TO ME SAYING. YOU

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.695 region:rollup2

00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.930 region:rollup2
IN A LONG TIME.

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:47.531 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A HOPE THAT I

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.867 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY OF EXPERIENCED

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.936 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF DEALING WITH MY OWN

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:53.237 region:rollup2
UNWANTED SAME SEX ATTRACTION.

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:56.407 region:rollup2
I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BECOME A

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:58.175 region:rollup2
MOTHER OF THREE SONS YOUR NOTE

00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:59.043 region:rollup2

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:01.078 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD.

00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:02.913 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE DOING QUITE WELL BUT

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:04.515 region:rollup2
WHAT A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:06.550 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD HAVE FORFEITED HAD

00:48:04.515 --> 00:48:08.753 region:rollup2
I PURSUE THE ROUTE I WAS GOING

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.888 region:rollup2
AND. HASN'T STABLE AS I WAS

00:48:08.753 --> 00:48:12.189 region:rollup2
PERHAPS COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WAS

00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:13.524 region:rollup2
VERY TROUBLED BY WHAT I WAS

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:14.425 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH.

00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:15.893 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY AROUND ME WAS

00:48:14.425 --> 00:48:16.994 region:rollup2
AFFIRMING IT.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.596 region:rollup2
IT WAS IN A MATTER OF LACK OF

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:20.731 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATION.

00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:22.933 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:24.702 region:rollup2
ALL THESE RESOURCES THAT WERE.

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:26.237 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHICH WERE AROUND BUT

TO BE DRACONIAN IN THIS MEASURES

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:43.948 region:rollup2
IT'S AN OVER REACH IT NO LONGER

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:45.416 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T RESPECT THOSE WHO ARE

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:50.421 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS A DISRESPECT THOSE

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:09.974 region:rollup2
IF THEY SO WISH.

00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:11.675 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE PROHIBITING IS THE

00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:13.544 region:rollup2

THESE EXPERIENCES WERE ONLY ONE

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:35.092 region:rollup2
OF THE ABUSES THAT LED TO

AS AN APPROPRIATE PRACTICE.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:55.111 region:rollup2

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:33.043 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL INTERVENTIONS.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:34.244 region:rollup2
AND SO. THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:36.680 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE HAD BETWEEN YOUR

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:38.114 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT AND THE THERAPISTS

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.616 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOMENT THE THERAPISTS

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:41.518 region:rollup2
SEEKS TO CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:42.786 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION. EVEN IF IT'S

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:45.322 region:rollup2
AT THE REQUEST.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:46.523 region:rollup2
OF THE PATIENT.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:49.192 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THIS.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:50.760 region:rollup2
A BILL WOULD APPLY.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.629 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO SEEK RESTITUTION

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:56.266 region:rollup2
MEANING RECOVERY. OF THE A OF

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:58.702 region:rollup2
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THEY

01:03:56.266 --> 01:04:00.904 region:rollup2
SPENT FOR THOSE SERVICES AND SO

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.405 region:rollup2
AND YOUR BELIEF THIS IS NARROW

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:05.408 region:rollup2
THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED THAT

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:06.943 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S JUST IF THERE IS ANY.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:08.978 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO ENGAGE IN.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:11.581 region:rollup2
FULL CHANGE.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:13.416 region:rollup2
BUT OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ALREADY

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.551 region:rollup2
IN STATUTE IS ACCEPTED I'M

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:16.386 region:rollup2
INSIDE ACTUALLY AN AMENDMENT

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.021 region:rollup2
YOUR BILL ISN'T CHANGES IS A

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.589 region:rollup2
CURRENT DEFINITION OF COPING.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:22.559 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING STRATEGIES

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:24.961 region:rollup2
FOR EXPLORING. AND THAT IS ALL

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:27.297 region:rollup2
STILL ALLOWED AS A TRANSACTION

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:28.365 region:rollup2
UNDER YOUR BELT. THAT'S CORRECT

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:29.866 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S UNDER AN

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.634 region:rollup2
EXEC YOU I THINK I THINK STATURE

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:34.771 region:rollup2
OKAY AND AND AND YOU KNOW TO GO

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:36.506 region:rollup2
EVEN. FURTHER AGAIN A A LOT OF.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.708 region:rollup2
OF THE OPPOSITION REYES FIRST

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:40.777 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT ISSUES. AND THOSE ARE

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.711 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUES TO RAISE YES

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:42.812 region:rollup2
OTHER SIGNIFICANT.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:44.280 region:rollup2
AND THE THE COMMITTEE SHOULD

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.748 region:rollup2
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY BUT I THINK

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.149 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DO TAKE THEM

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:47.550 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:50.053 region:rollup2
THEY WILL FIND THAT WHEN.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.187 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION'S YOU KNOW STOP

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.189 region:rollup2
BOOKS UP FOR EXAMPLE.

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:56.659 region:rollup2
AGAIN INDIVIDUALS CAN EXPRESS

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.862 region:rollup2
THEIR OPINION.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:05:02.165 region:rollup2
ABOUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:04.167 region:rollup2
CAN IN DORSET IF THEY SO CHOOSE

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:04.734 region:rollup2
IN A PUBLISHED BOOK.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.069 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO SELL

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.637 region:rollup2
BOOKS

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.205 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOMENT AGAIN THAT

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.639 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF SEEKING TO CHANGE

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.774 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.609 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:14.010 region:rollup2
TRIGGERS.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.345 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:17.247 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL AGAIN

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:18.114 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.449 region:rollup2
SO HE SIMPLY SPEAKING ABOUT YOUR

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.017 region:rollup2
POSITION ON THE ISSUE IS

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.085 region:rollup2
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.820 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE'S ABILITY TO

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:25.588 region:rollup2
EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.423 region:rollup2
RIGHTS OKAY BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.457 region:rollup2
ANYONE MY QUESTIONS IS.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.025 region:rollup2
AND IF I HAD A CONSTITUENT WHO

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:31.060 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUST.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:32.328 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.563 region:rollup2
THOSE BOOKS IN ARE ON THE TABLE

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:35.565 region:rollup2
I'M NOT MAKING YOU I'M LOATH TO

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:37.167 region:rollup2
MAKE CHOICES FOR PEOPLE.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.902 region:rollup2
BUT IF THEY WOULD STILL HAVE

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:40.537 region:rollup2
UNDER YOU YOUR UNDERSTAND IN THE

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:42.238 region:rollup2
STATUTE THEY WOULD STILL HAVE

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:43.606 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.974 region:rollup2
BOOKS ABOUT THIS RIGHT THE LID

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.109 region:rollup2
THE LITERATURE ON SEXUAL

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.710 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY CAN STILL

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.611 region:rollup2
EXIST.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.146 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL PEOPLE CAN

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:52.348 region:rollup2
PURCHASE.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:55.251 region:rollup2
LITERATURE ABOUT CONVERSION

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:57.387 region:rollup2
THERAPY IT IS THE MOMENT THAT.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:58.988 region:rollup2
THAT AND THE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:01.157 region:rollup2
WRITING THE BOOK OR THE

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.692 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL THE THERAPIST AGAIN

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.194 region:rollup2
MEETING WITH THE PATIENT.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:06.629 region:rollup2
SEEK TO CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:08.231 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.766 region:rollup2
THAT'S AGAIN WHERE THE THE BILL

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.133 region:rollup2
TRIGGERS.

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:12.535 region:rollup2
SO.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:14.938 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS A VERY OVERLY

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:17.207 region:rollup2
BROAD POSITION TO SUGGEST THAT

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:18.975 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW THE LITERATURE ON SEXUAL

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:20.009 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY IS GONNA BE

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.878 region:rollup2
REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES AS A

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:23.746 region:rollup2
RESULT. IN IT THERE'S A I I

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.881 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH.

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.416 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THERAPY I DO HAVE

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.585 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE STATUTE

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.719 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T AS A LAWYER AND THIS

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:31.588 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR STATUTE AT.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:33.523 region:rollup2
.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:35.391 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARGUE.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.526 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.561 region:rollup2
ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED UNDER

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:40.730 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW BECAUSE THE STATUTE

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:42.465 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA?

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.632 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.701 region:rollup2
IF.

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.902 region:rollup2
.

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:47.971 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYING YOU'RE GONNA

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:49.205 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.673 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN'T A IN A IN A

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.741 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION AS A FOR

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.375 region:rollup2
A BECOMES A FRAUDULENT

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:54.410 region:rollup2
TRANSACTION.

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.278 region:rollup2
.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.779 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS A LITTLE

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:58.147 region:rollup2
BIT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THE REASONS

01:06:56.779 --> 01:07:00.750 region:rollup2
AYE I'LL AYE WAS LOOKING INTO

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:02.685 region:rollup2
THIS WHY THIS IS NECESSARY.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.853 region:rollup2
TO PUT THIS IN THAT LEGISLATION

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:06.656 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE EXISTING

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:08.224 region:rollup2
STATUTE WHICH BY THE WAY. WHEN

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:09.559 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LAWSUITS.

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:11.928 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE OF THE THREE OR FOUR

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:13.296 region:rollup2
STATUTES THAT'S ALWAYS CHARGED

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.797 region:rollup2
AT IT YOU ALWAYS AND MADE

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.265 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.267 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:18.334 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL SEE A LOT OF CASES

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.904 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:23.139 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S NECESSARY?

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:24.607 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THIS PARTICULAR AT M.

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:26.109 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO IT GIVEN THAT THERE

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:27.777 region:rollup2
ARE SOME WHO ARGUE IT ALREADY

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:29.646 region:rollup2
CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME YOU TRY TO.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:31.014 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING AND AND AND

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.448 region:rollup2
MARKET AND SELL SOMETHING IN THE

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:33.983 region:rollup2
CONSUMER TRANSACTION THAT YOU

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:37.086 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS FRAUDULENT.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:39.055 region:rollup2
DO YOU ARE OPEN TO. BEING SUED

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:41.457 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STATUTE RIGHT AND SO

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:43.092 region:rollup2
FROM THERE WOULD HAVE TO ENSUE

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:44.594 region:rollup2
EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS WITH

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:47.230 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:49.532 region:rollup2
SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.833 region:rollup2
AND EXPERT TESTIMONY THE

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:52.268 region:rollup2
QUESTION I THINK FOR THE

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:54.137 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:56.773 region:rollup2
FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PIECE OF

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:58.074 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WHETHER THAT SEXUAL

01:07:56.773 --> 01:08:00.910 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:02.812 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE A

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.080 region:rollup2
DECEPTIVE PRACTICE.

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:05.615 region:rollup2
BY THE VERY TERMS UNDER THE

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.283 region:rollup2
CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AND

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:09.485 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:10.453 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING TODAY. I'M AND YOU

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.755 region:rollup2
SAID THE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:14.557 region:rollup2
IS SURE. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.558 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND WIN OR

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:17.460 region:rollup2
LOSE IN COURT.

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:18.861 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.931 region:rollup2
LITIGATION PROCESS.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE SEXUAL CONVERSION

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:25.468 region:rollup2
THERAPY IS NOT CALLED OUT AS A

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.336 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE.

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:28.538 region:rollup2
IN THE LAW.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT DEBATE WOULD HAVE TO

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:32.375 region:rollup2
BE HAD IN LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:33.977 region:rollup2
WEARS UNDER THIS ON THAT WOULD

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:35.378 region:rollup2
BE CONSIDERED TO BE FRAUDULENT

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:36.679 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW MEASURE I DON'T

01:08:35.378 --> 01:08:37.380 region:rollup2
THINK YOU CAN AND LIKE TO LOOK

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.849 region:rollup2
INTO THIS BUT YOU CAN GET

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.184 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY'S FEES. AND THINK UNDER

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.018 region:rollup2
SEAL ARE A.

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:43.920 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE SITTING UP YOU CAN

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.855 region:rollup2
GET PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.257 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOT SHOULDN'T OF UNITIVE

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:50.360 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE CONDUCT.

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:52.295 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THE WAY

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.164 region:rollup2
OF TAILORED THIS.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:56.466 region:rollup2
TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO A IN A

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:58.601 region:rollup2
VERY SAYS SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO

01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.637 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:01.170 region:rollup2
AS A BECAUSE I WANT I WANT A

01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:02.138 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT MIGHT HAVE A

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.339 region:rollup2
CHILLING EFFECT AS THEY'RE GOING

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.641 region:rollup2
THROUGH WHATEVER THEY ARE TRYING

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:06.976 region:rollup2
TO EXPLORE. WE DON'T WANT THE

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.411 region:rollup2
JUST THE OPPOSITE TO HAPPEN

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:10.179 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T.

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:11.781 region:rollup2
GO TO SOMEONE WHO IS AT LEAST BE

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:13.383 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.785 region:rollup2
OR FOR THE PROFESSIONAL.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:17.220 region:rollup2
REPUTABLE THERAPISTS TO BE ABLE

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.388 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
AND SAID THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:22.225 region:rollup2
TRYING TO HAVE THIS IS NARROWLY

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:23.459 region:rollup2
TAILORED AS POSSIBLE IS IS KEY.

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:25.094 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE ARE

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:27.497 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS ALREADY IN EXISTING

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:29.265 region:rollup2
LAW THAT HAVE BEEN DECIDED BY.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:32.769 region:rollup2
THE SUPREME COURT.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:34.103 region:rollup2
OF I BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.104 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN AFFIRMING THE NIGHT

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.538 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE NIGHT

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.106 region:rollup2
CIRCUIT'S DECISION.

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:38.875 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT OPTION TO

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:41.878 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:43.379 region:rollup2
SO I I AM COMFORTED BY THAT.

01:09:41.878 --> 01:09:44.914 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IS THAT YOU HAVE

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.949 region:rollup2
ADULT CONSTITUENTS TO.

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:47.984 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.685 region:rollup2
FOR THEMSELVES AS THEY GO

01:09:47.984 --> 01:09:49.919 region:rollup2
THROUGH A JOURNEY I AM

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.788 region:rollup2
UNFAMILIAR WITH BUT I DON'T WANT

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.689 region:rollup2
TO TIE THEIR HANDS.

01:09:51.788 --> 01:09:54.624 region:rollup2
SO MY FINAL QUESTION GOES TO THE

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.559 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS CONSTRUED THE CONCERNS

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:59.362 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WILL.

01:09:56.559 --> 01:10:00.830 region:rollup2
SQUELCH RELIGIOUS SPEECH.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:02.732 region:rollup2
AND I I WOULD LOVE THAT IS

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:04.400 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS WELL. I WOULD BE

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:06.002 region:rollup2
SURPRISED IF THIS DOESN'T HAVE

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.403 region:rollup2
SOME CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE AT

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:08.671 region:rollup2
SOME POINT BECAUSE HE'S A REALLY

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:10.173 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS.

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:11.641 region:rollup2
IF ANY OF THE PROPONENTS CAN

01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:12.975 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT IS

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:15.278 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:16.679 region:rollup2
SOMEONE CAN STILL GO TO CLERGY.

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:18.381 region:rollup2
OR A OUR ANYONE WHO DOES NOT

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:19.916 region:rollup2
CHARGE.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.351 region:rollup2
TO HAVE HAD THIS THEY CAN STILL

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:23.486 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT. SO THAT IF SOMEONE

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO CLERGY

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:26.923 region:rollup2
THEY CAN STILL GO TO SOMEONE

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.524 region:rollup2
ELSE BUT IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:30.526 region:rollup2
POINT I WOULD BE GRATEFUL.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:33.162 region:rollup2
IF THEY IF A CHURCH.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:35.598 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE SERVICES THAT IT

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:37.500 region:rollup2
PROVIDES TO ITS MEMBERS INCLUDES

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:40.403 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:43.673 region:rollup2
THEY MAY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
THAT SERVICE UNDER. THIS LAW.

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:47.176 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT. BECAUSE THAT

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.145 region:rollup2
TRANSACTION HAVE TO TAKE PLACE.

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:50.980 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE THAT THE TRANSACTION

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.448 region:rollup2
OF HAVING TO PAY FOR THAT

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.951 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SERVICE UNDERSTOOD

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:56.686 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO AGAIN IF IT IS FREE

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.186 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.621 region:rollup2
IF IT IS PROVIDED TO ITS

01:10:57.186 --> 01:11:00.790 region:rollup2
MEMBERSHIP.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:03.025 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT IS PERFECTLY

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:04.827 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. UNDER THE LAW IN

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:06.229 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR THE CONSUMER LEGAL

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:08.064 region:rollup2
REMEDIES ACT APPLY YOU HAVE TO

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:10.233 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT EXCHANGE. IN.

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:10.867 region:rollup2
YET AT THAT TRANSACTION AND IN

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.301 region:rollup2
MANY CHURCHES PROVIDE MINISTRY

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.469 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS SO

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:16.272 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS WELL THAT YOU DON'T

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:18.074 region:rollup2
LIMIT IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.542 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AT YOU BUT YEAH EXACTLY

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.910 region:rollup2
I. AM.

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:22.545 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I FINALLY AYE AYE SORT

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:24.180 region:rollup2
OF THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS

01:11:22.545 --> 01:11:26.048 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD NOT

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.950 region:rollup2
WANT A PERSON WHO IS EXPLORING

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:30.253 region:rollup2
OPTIONS OF THEIR. GENDER

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.687 region:rollup2
IDENTITY TO BE FINE THE ONLY

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.656 region:rollup2
AVENUE THEY CAN GO TO IS ONE

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:35.825 region:rollup2
THAT IS FAITH BASED.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:40.463 region:rollup2
SO FOR MY CONSTITUENT WHO DOES

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:43.533 region:rollup2
NOT WANT TO GO TO A FAITH BASED.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:45.902 region:rollup2
PERSON FOR CONVERSATION AND

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:47.803 region:rollup2
COUNSELING. ON THIS WHAT DOES

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:49.672 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON DO IF THIS BILL

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:52.475 region:rollup2
PASSES I'M JUST LOOKING OUT FOR

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:53.776 region:rollup2
MY CONSTITUENTS HERE SO.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.244 region:rollup2
I NEVER OF A MIGHT TO THAT OF

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:56.479 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR RECOGNITION THAT

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.613 region:rollup2
DOCTOR HOLDEN FORMER PRESIDENT

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.781 region:rollup2
OF THIS AYE KHALFAN

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.649 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION IS

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:02.618 region:rollup2
ALSO HERE.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:03.352 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.353 region:rollup2
MIGHT THINK OF SNOW.

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:06.222 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU SAID

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
SOMETHING A A FEW MOMENTS AGO

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:08.891 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY BELONGS IN THIS

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.193 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I THINK YOU SAID

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:12.495 region:rollup2
WORDS TO THE EFFECT OF I AM

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:14.964 region:rollup2
LOATH TO MAKE CHOICES FOR OTHER

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:16.866 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THEM.

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:19.402 region:rollup2
THAT FITS HERE BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:20.937 region:rollup2
ARE ADDRESSING IS NOT.

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:22.471 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY AT ALL OF THE

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:24.140 region:rollup2
THERAPIST WO IS ENTERTAINING

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.474 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH REFLECTIVE

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.009 region:rollup2
INQUIRY FOR ALL THE COMPLEX

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.911 region:rollup2
REASONS

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.079 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WOULD WANT. TO CONSIDER

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:32.348 region:rollup2
CHANGING THEIR SEXUAL

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:34.650 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION BUT RATHER.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:36.953 region:rollup2
THIS FOCUSES ON THE ROLL OF THE

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:38.888 region:rollup2
THERAPIST WHO IS MARKETING

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:41.324 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT OP PRIORI.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:43.559 region:rollup2
IS SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO CHANGE

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:46.229 region:rollup2
YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION THROUGH

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:47.697 region:rollup2
WHATEVER MEANS AND SO THE ONUS

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:50.466 region:rollup2
REALLY IS ON THE PRACTITIONER TO

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:53.436 region:rollup2
TO. DEMONSTRATE THAT SHE OR HE

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:54.770 region:rollup2
IS ABLE TO FOUGHT FULLY ENGAGE

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:56.873 region:rollup2
THE PERSON ALL OF THAT THAT WHO

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:59.208 region:rollup2
CRIES RATHER THAN A KNEE JERK.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.911 region:rollup2
REFLEXIVE REACTION BECOMES FROM

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.379 region:rollup2
THIS LONG DISCREDITED NOTION

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:05.481 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:07.550 region:rollup2
PATHOLOGICAL OR WRONG ABOUT

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:10.253 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THAT.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:11.587 region:rollup2
ONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION DERIVES

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:14.257 region:rollup2
FROM EARLY LIFE DRAMATIC

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:15.524 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THAT IS SO OLD AND

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:17.260 region:rollup2
DISCREDITED BY THE PROFESSION

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:19.028 region:rollup2
I'M SURPRISED IT EVEN COMES.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:21.130 region:rollup2
INTO THIS ROOM TODAY BUT THE

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:21.631 region:rollup2
REALLY THE FOCUS IS ON AND SO IF

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.633 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A CONSTITUENT.

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.467 region:rollup2

TO ME ABOUT THIS THIS LAW DOES

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:36.312 region:rollup2
NOT. AFFECT THAT AS LONG AS THE

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:38.681 region:rollup2
PERSON IS IS NOT MARKETING HER

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:40.983 region:rollup2
OR HIMSELF AS A PURVEYOR. OF.

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:42.685 region:rollup2
CHANGING YOUR SEXUAL

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:43.552 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION.

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:45.121 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT AND THINK YOU

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:47.957 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:50.359 region:rollup2
I'VE STATUS VERY VERY CAREFULLY

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.927 region:rollup2
WITH NO PARTICULARLY IDEOLOGY

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.396 region:rollup2
IDEOLOGICAL WINDOW ON HERE.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:55.197 region:rollup2
AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:56.565 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.066 region:rollup2
TO SOMEONE GOING THROUGH A

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.901 region:rollup2
JOURNEY THAT I HAVE NOT

EXPERIENCED.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:01.904 region:rollup2
AND.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.406 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THIS IS MUCH MORE

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:05.041 region:rollup2
NARROWLY TAILORED THAN EVEN THE

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.509 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME I READ IT I THOUGHT

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.277 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME I READ. THAT IS

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:09.745 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BROADEST OVERBROAD

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.480 region:rollup2
THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:13.816 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR FOR A STATUTE THAT

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:16.085 region:rollup2

SINK THAT YOU THROW IT IN COURT.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.823 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IT DOES PROVIDE

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:22.625 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:23.726 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD WHO ARE

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.294 region:rollup2

BILL BUT BECAUSE OF THE RESPECT

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:57.760 region:rollup2
I HAVE FOR YOU. AND THE CO

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
AUTHORS ON THE BILL I THOUGHT

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.428 region:rollup2
I'D TAKE A MINUTE AND EXPLAIN

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:01.564 region:rollup2
WHY.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
SO. TO ME WHEN I READ THROUGH

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:05.768 region:rollup2
THE BILL THE OPERATIVE PARTS OF

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:07.470 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS THAT SEEKS TO.

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:08.971 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH SEXUAL CONVERSION

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.672 region:rollup2
THERAPY AS WHAT IT CALLS A

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.508 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OF QUESTIONABLE

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:14.677 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.311 region:rollup2
AND OUT THERE FOR A FRAUDULENT

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.112 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT SHOULD BE

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:16.712 region:rollup2
OUTLAWED.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE BILL

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:19.915 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.217 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD A SPIRITED DISCUSSION

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:22.218 region:rollup2
HERE OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:24.653 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SEXUAL

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:25.154 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY IS OF

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:27.723 region:rollup2
VALIDITY.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:29.158 region:rollup2
BUT TO ME THAT ENTIRE DISCUSSION

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:30.426 region:rollup2
IS MISPLACED BECAUSE THE

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.894 region:rollup2
OPERATIVE POINT OF THE BILL IN

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:34.296 region:rollup2
MY OPINION.

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:35.598 region:rollup2
IS IF A HEALTH RELATED PRACTICE

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:36.999 region:rollup2
IS OF COURSE QUESTIONABLE

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:39.068 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY SHOULD IT BE

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:40.302 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE LAW.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.704 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS A VERY

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:43.539 region:rollup2
SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:45.541 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FEEL

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.475 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.077 region:rollup2
THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:50.212 region:rollup2
HEALTH PRINT PRACTICES.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.514 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PRACTICED BY MILLIONS

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.015 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS THAT NINETY

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:54.350 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF US HERE IN THE ROOM

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:56.152 region:rollup2
WOULD AGREE ARE OF QUESTIONABLE

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:57.920 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY AND YET WE

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:59.855 region:rollup2
RESPECT THE RIGHTS. FOR

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.257 region:rollup2
CONSENTING ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:03.225 region:rollup2
THOSE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.693 region:rollup2
BASED LEVEL OUR SOCIETY BELIEVES

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
IN FREEDOM AND LIBERTY.

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:07.430 region:rollup2
SO IF WE ARE GOING TO SAY.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.697 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS OF QUESTIONABLE

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:11.400 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC ABILITY AND SHOULD BE

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:13.235 region:rollup2
OUTLAWED WORD WE STOPPED WE CALL

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.937 region:rollup2
THESE PRACTICES. INTO THIS

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.938 region:rollup2
CHAMBER ONE BY ONE AN OUTLAW

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:18.040 region:rollup2
THEM DECLARE THAT THEIR KIDS

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.707 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE LAW REGARDLESS OF

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.543 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THEIR PRACTICE BY

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.110 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO ME

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.244 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE BILL

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.412 region:rollup2
AND.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.780 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILLS THAT

WOULD ONLY BAN ADVERTISING OR

ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:47.203 region:rollup2
CHANGE THERAPY WHERE THERE IS A

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.270 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION WITH THE

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.905 region:rollup2
GOAL OF CHANGING A PERSON'S

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.340 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION. IT WOULD NOT

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:52.875 region:rollup2
IMPACT INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.477 region:rollup2
SEEK COUNSEL FROM FAITH LEADERS

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:57.046 region:rollup2
OR EVEN THERAPY FROM RELIGIOUS

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:59.181 region:rollup2
GROUPS SO LONG AS. THE GOAL IS

01:16:57.046 --> 01:17:00.850 region:rollup2
NOT TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:02.351 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NO TRANSACTION AND

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:05.187 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ACCEPTANCE SUPPORTER

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.455 region:rollup2
FACILITATE COPING. IDENTITY

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.189 region:rollup2
EXPLORATION OR SEXUAL

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.824 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION NEUTRAL

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.259 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.461 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:14.363 region:rollup2
DO NOT SEEK TO CHANGE SEXUAL

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.632 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION AS WELL AS THE FACT

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:17.533 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS COURT PRECEDENT

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.802 region:rollup2
THAT HAS UPHELD THE CALIFORNIA

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:21.871 region:rollup2
LAW. BANNING CONVERSION THERAPY

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:24.173 region:rollup2
FOR MINORS MAKING IT UNLIKELY IN

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:25.574 region:rollup2
MY OPINION A THAT COURTS WOULD

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:29.311 region:rollup2
FIND THIS BILL.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:31.847 region:rollup2
NOT TO INFRINGE ON FREE SPEECH

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:35.284 region:rollup2
OR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS I'M I I I

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:36.719 region:rollup2
THINK YOU KNOW. IS SLIPPERY

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:38.154 region:rollup2
SLOPE BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.787 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT KIND OF ARGUMENT

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:44.860 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SEEN THE BILL THE

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:45.828 region:rollup2
REALITY IS IS THAT

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.863 region:rollup2
THE MESSAGE TO US IS THAT

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:49.398 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TOMORROW

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:51.634 region:rollup2
IF THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS OR OF

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:52.201 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES PASS. AND I THINK

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:53.903 region:rollup2
IT'S INTERESTING TO MAKE A

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:55.571 region:rollup2
SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT BECAUSE.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:57.540 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ARE YOU CAN MAKE THAT

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:59.608 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT I THINK FOR ANYTHING

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.177 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THIS WAS

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:03.512 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY GONNA. GONNA LEAD TO

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.713 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.714 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CAN THAT THAT WE'RE

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.215 region:rollup2
NOT TRYING TO GET OUT WELL I

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.016 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BILL IS VERY

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:08.751 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD. WHEN IT COMES

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.251 region:rollup2
TO SPECIFIC PRACTICES WITH

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:12.188 region:rollup2
REGARD TO.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:13.389 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:15.190 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY AS A MEANS

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:15.758 region:rollup2
TO FIX IT WHICH I'M NOT EVEN

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.793 region:rollup2
SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:18.894 region:rollup2
MEANS OR THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE I

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.529 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE THAT THIS BILL WHICH

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.964 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT TO ME. ARE

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:25.701 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS ANY INDIVIDUAL FROM

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:27.036 region:rollup2
SEEKING OUT ANY TYPE OF OF HELP

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:29.038 region:rollup2
OR OR.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.874 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:34.143 region:rollup2
THAT WITH A A THERAPIST IN ANY

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:35.277 region:rollup2
WAY SHAPE OR FORM.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:37.379 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT.

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:39.315 region:rollup2
YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME TO

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:41.550 region:rollup2
TOO NARROWLY TAILOR THE BILL TO

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:43.819 region:rollup2
STE TO AFFECT A SPECIFIC. ARE

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.920 region:rollup2
ISSUE I AND AND AND AND THAT'S

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:47.323 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE LIKE INDIVIDUALS LIKE

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.923 region:rollup2
MYSELF TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS IDEA

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:48.791 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSION THERAPY I DON'T

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.759 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IN IT.

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:52.695 region:rollup2
OUR A OUR AND BE.

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:55.598 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT.

01:18:52.695 --> 01:18:58.100 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. WHEN I LOOK AT THE

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:59.268 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL GROUPS THAT ARE IN.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:02.071 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:02.438 region:rollup2
IT DOES IT DOES SADDEN ME I

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.872 region:rollup2
MEAN I I THINK.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:05.874 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.109 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE BIBLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.676 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SOMEHOW THIS BILL'S

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.877 region:rollup2
GOING BRAVE I THINK THAT'S

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.845 region:rollup2
RIDICULOUS CLAIM.

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:12.147 region:rollup2
AND.

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:14.783 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF CHURCH

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:15.050 region:rollup2
FIRST I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:15.784 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:18.053 region:rollup2
.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:19.555 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. WE ARE ALL CREATED IN

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:21.457 region:rollup2
GOD'S IMAGE WILL GO BROKE IMAGE

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:23.292 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF HOW WE ARE.

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:25.427 region:rollup2
BORN WHETHER THAT IS WORK DAY

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:27.329 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT TRANSGENDER BISEXUAL

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:29.164 region:rollup2
WHATEVER I THINK IT IS ALL

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:30.399 region:rollup2
PURPOSEFUL. I THINK IT IS ALL

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:33.369 region:rollup2
MEANT TO BE.

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:35.404 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS ALL BY DESIGN.

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:36.739 region:rollup2
I AND AND TO SEE SO MANY

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:38.107 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS GROUPS.

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:39.908 region:rollup2
IN OPPOSITION IT.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.776 region:rollup2
IT DOES MAKE ME SAD BECAUSE A

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:42.544 region:rollup2
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:44.279 region:rollup2
HURT. ARE BY THESE TYPES OF

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:45.848 region:rollup2
THERAPIES RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.516 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE HAVE BETTER ACTORS I

01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:49.218 region:rollup2
MEAN WE HAVE MORE GENTLE ACTORS

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:50.786 region:rollup2
IN INDIVIDUALS TAKING THE TIME.

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:52.588 region:rollup2
OUT TO CONDUCT THIS THERAPY IN A

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.188 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY OF IT IN OTHER

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:54.390 region:rollup2
AREAS I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:56.525 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SHIRT CONVERSION

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.559 region:rollup2
THERAPY PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.961 region:rollup2
PROBABLY LODGE EVERYTHING

01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:01.430 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPIES. PER AND

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:05.601 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IN THE SOUTH SO.

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:07.670 region:rollup2
YA I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE.

01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:09.905 region:rollup2
THE TIME THAT EVERYBODY HAS

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:11.807 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO TRY TO CRAFT THIS BILL

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:13.575 region:rollup2
IN A NARROWLY TAILORED WAY.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:16.612 region:rollup2
AND.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:54.183 region:rollup2
ON THE BASIS THAT IS NOT

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:56.218 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED AND IS

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:57.920 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL.

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:59.655 region:rollup2
TO A PATIENT'S MENTAL HEALTH.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.956 region:rollup2

AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:25.347 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.982 region:rollup2
ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:29.551 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE

SO IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOU

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:39.228 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT OR DON'T BELIEVE IT.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:41.764 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT US

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:43.999 region:rollup2
PROTECTING CONSUMERS WHICH IS

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:46.301 region:rollup2
MUCH OF WHAT WE WE DO IN THE

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:48.170 region:rollup2

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:53.809 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS BEING GIVEN TO

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:55.444 region:rollup2
THOSE OF US THAT ARE CONSTANTLY

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:57.513 region:rollup2
CONSUMING IN THAT IT'S.

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:59.782 region:rollup2
THAT'S FAIR ITS OPENNESS

01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:03.118 region:rollup2

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:04.419 region:rollup2
MEETS A MEASURE OF. CONSUMER

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:07.089 region:rollup2

THERAPY HELPED ME.

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:55.864 region:rollup2

PERSON YOU LOVED I SERVED.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:10.111 region:rollup2
AS LOCAL OFFICES MANY OF YOU DID

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:10.679 region:rollup2
AS MAYOR I COULD OFFICIATE A

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:12.614 region:rollup2

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.015 region:rollup2

A GOOD HOST A BLOOD DRIVE BUT

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:20.822 region:rollup2
COULD NOT DONATE BLOOD MYSELF.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
I CAN LOOK IN THE BOY SCOUTS TO

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:25.694 region:rollup2
CITY HOLDER IN THE MERIT BADGE

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:27.195 region:rollup2

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:28.864 region:rollup2
IN THE BOY SCOUTS.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:31.933 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN HEARING ABOUT THE.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:33.768 region:rollup2
THE PAIN SUFFERING OF.

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:34.102 region:rollup2
WITH THESE PRACTICES WILL DO TO

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.904 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:36.538 region:rollup2

THE SAME SENTIMENT AND FEELING.

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
AND THE AYE.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.480 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:45.981 region:rollup2
STAND BEFORE YOU AS A STRONGER

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.349 region:rollup2

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.750 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS

01:29:47.349 --> 01:29:52.487 region:rollup2

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:54.155 region:rollup2
ALSO EQUAL PEOPLE.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:56.725 region:rollup2

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:59.261 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED TO CONVERT.

01:29:56.725 --> 01:30:00.095 region:rollup2
PROUD OF YOUR IDENTITY.

01:29:59.261 --> 01:30:01.563 region:rollup2

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:03.331 region:rollup2
THAT WE CELEBRATE.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:04.833 region:rollup2

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:08.436 region:rollup2
YOURSELF.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.805 region:rollup2
AND.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:12.974 region:rollup2
THIS RECOGNITION OF THIS IS A

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:14.109 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE.

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:16.544 region:rollup2
HELPS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:17.612 region:rollup2

SINCERELY.

01:30:24.953 --> 01:30:28.890 region:rollup2

THESE ADVERTISERS HAVE ARGUED

01:39:57.558 --> 01:40:02.730 region:rollup2

01:40:56.918 --> 01:41:01.022 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LOOPHOLE AS THE BILL

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.623 region:rollup2
DOESN'T A DRAFT OF THE CURRENT

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:04.191 region:rollup2

CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT

01:41:09.664 --> 01:41:14.368 region:rollup2
AT ALL. SO THIS BILL WOULD

01:41:11.966 --> 01:41:20.374 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT AND MAKE FALSITY IN

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:23.678 region:rollup2
THE BODY. UNLAWFUL JUST AS

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:29.116 region:rollup2
AS A MISTER CHAO SAID INJUNCTIVE

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:30.151 region:rollup2
RELIEF WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:32.253 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ADDED.

01:41:30.151 --> 01:41:32.486 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW QUARTS TO STOP BAD

01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:34.789 region:rollup2

WHILE WE MAY NOT QUARREL THAT

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:57.725 region:rollup2

TECHNICAL AND PLEASE STOP ME IF

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:22.316 region:rollup2
THIS IS TOO DETAILED THERE IS A

01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:24.017 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DATABASE WE CAN LOOK UP

01:50:22.316 --> 01:50:26.453 region:rollup2
TO SEE WHO OWNS A DOMAIN NAME.

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:28.555 region:rollup2
AND SPAMMERS DON'T LIKE PEOPLE

01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:29.923 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO WHAT

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:31.525 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IS THEY DO WHAT'S CALLED

OF THEIR DOMAIN NAME TO A PROXY

01:50:35.329 --> 01:50:39.066 region:rollup2

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:41.034 region:rollup2
OF THE DOMAIN NAME BACK TO THE

01:50:39.066 --> 01:50:42.703 region:rollup2
ACTUAL SPAMMER. THE RESULT IS

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:44.204 region:rollup2
THAT THE SPAMMER CAN SPAM AWAY

01:50:42.703 --> 01:50:45.405 region:rollup2
BUT A PERSON CLEARING THE

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:46.640 region:rollup2

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:48.475 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SEE AS THE PROXY

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.711 region:rollup2

AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT IS A

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:07.361 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE AND SHOULD

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:09.062 region:rollup2
BE OUTLAWED BUT OTHER PARTS OF

01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:10.464 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALREADY DO THAT. BY

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:12.933 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:51:10.464 --> 01:51:13.800 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMER

01:51:12.933 --> 01:51:15.202 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.803 region:rollup2
LOOK UP THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO

01:51:15.202 --> 01:51:17.838 region:rollup2
OWNS A DOMAIN USING A

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:19.139 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION SERVICE SUCH AS WHO

01:51:17.838 --> 01:51:20.807 region:rollup2
IS.

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:21.708 region:rollup2
AND. MY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:23.210 region:rollup2
THAT MOST COMMERCIAL

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:25.612 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION SERVICES.

01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:26.513 region:rollup2
BY DEFAULT ALREADY PROXY THOSE

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:28.916 region:rollup2
ARE REGISTRATION NAMES IF YOU

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:31.151 region:rollup2
USE REGISTER DOT COM TODAY TO GO

01:51:28.916 --> 01:51:32.019 region:rollup2
REGISTER A NEW DOMAIN NAME BY

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:34.054 region:rollup2
DEFAULT UNLESS YOU UNCHECK THE

01:51:32.019 --> 01:51:36.390 region:rollup2
BOX WILL BE PROXY THROUGH THEM

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:39.626 region:rollup2
SO. ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO OWN

01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:41.995 region:rollup2
DOMAINS HELP PRIVACY REASONS WHY

01:51:39.626 --> 01:51:43.497 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PUBLISH THE THOUGH

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:44.798 region:rollup2
THERE IF THERE ARE OWNERSHIP

01:51:43.497 --> 01:51:45.866 region:rollup2
LISTINGS OF REMAINS THAT HAVE

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:47.267 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO DO WITH A FRAUDULENT

01:51:45.866 --> 01:51:48.936 region:rollup2
INTENT SO. I WOULD HIGHLY

01:51:47.267 --> 01:51:50.003 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOU MISTER CHAIR AS

01:51:48.936 --> 01:51:51.772 region:rollup2
YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:54.808 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT WHY

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:55.442 region:rollup2
THAT PROVISIONS IN HERE. BECAUSE

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:55.909 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT THAT IT BELONGS

01:51:55.442 --> 01:51:58.345 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:59.680 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN WITH

01:51:58.345 --> 01:52:01.782 region:rollup2
SECTION BE NINE OF THE BILL

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:03.584 region:rollup2
CONCERNING THE USE OF THE WORD

01:52:01.782 --> 01:52:04.751 region:rollup2
FREE AND I UNDERSTAND THE

01:52:03.584 --> 01:52:07.754 region:rollup2
INTENT HERE.

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:08.155 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO.

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:10.924 region:rollup2
DO SOME SERIOUS.

01:52:08.155 --> 01:52:12.726 region:rollup2
SOUL SEARCHING ABOUT WHAT THE.

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.694 region:rollup2
WELL WHAT THE GOAL IS AND HOW

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:15.128 region:rollup2
BEST TO ACHIEVE IT BECAUSE THE

01:52:13.694 --> 01:52:16.863 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS IN A SUBJECT LINE I

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:18.832 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S.

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:20.067 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:21.668 region:rollup2
SOMEONE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:24.004 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN ALL OF THE TERMS AND

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:25.405 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER. AND USE

01:52:24.004 --> 01:52:26.440 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY SAID THE LANGUAGE YOU

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.307 region:rollup2
CAN'T PUT AN ABSTRACT AND

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.575 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN IT ELSEWHERE SO

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:29.943 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:31.445 region:rollup2
NOT SAYING THE FREE HAS TO BE

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:33.146 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED YOU'RE SAYING. THAT

01:52:31.445 --> 01:52:34.281 region:rollup2
FREE IS OUTLAWED.

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:34.982 region:rollup2
BUT I WHICH I DON'T THINK IS A

01:52:34.281 --> 01:52:36.416 region:rollup2
REASONABLE THING TO DO IN A

01:52:34.982 --> 01:52:37.851 region:rollup2
SUBJECT LINE AND ALSO I THINK

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:39.519 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO NEED TO CLARIFY. WHAT

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:41.255 region:rollup2
EXACTLY?

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:43.323 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF FREE THAT YOU'RE

01:52:41.255 --> 01:52:44.358 region:rollup2
OUT LONG IS BECAUSE IF YOU SAID

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:46.426 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE SUGAR FREE.

01:52:44.358 --> 01:52:47.728 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD NOT MEET

01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:48.829 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND YET.

01:52:47.728 --> 01:52:50.764 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEGAL

01:52:48.829 --> 01:52:51.398 region:rollup2
DEFINITION RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:51.932 region:rollup2
A TERM THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

01:52:51.398 --> 01:52:54.034 region:rollup2
USED SO I WOULD ASK IF YOU

01:52:51.932 --> 01:52:55.435 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:52:54.034 --> 01:52:56.937 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THE BILL

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:58.505 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD.

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:58.705 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WILL DO JUST THAT IN

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:00.274 region:rollup2
FACT.

01:52:58.705 --> 01:53:02.275 region:rollup2
.

01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:03.944 region:rollup2
WELL WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:06.747 region:rollup2
THE WORD FREED INTENT OBVIOUSLY

01:53:03.944 --> 01:53:08.482 region:rollup2
IS TO STOP THE USE OF THE WORD

01:53:06.747 --> 01:53:09.216 region:rollup2
FREE IF THE ITEM IS NOT FREE.

01:53:08.482 --> 01:53:11.652 region:rollup2
SO.

01:53:09.216 --> 01:53:14.554 region:rollup2
THE.

01:53:11.652 --> 01:53:15.422 region:rollup2
I THINK A. YOU KNOW EXAMPLES OF

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:17.224 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WOULD.

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:18.892 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW BASICALLY BE OKAY

01:53:17.224 --> 01:53:21.261 region:rollup2

ALL FREE IF YOU DO ACTS IN ON

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:23.997 region:rollup2
THE SUBJECT LINE I THINK THOSE

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ALLOWABLE ACCEPTABLE

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:26.833 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW. AND BUT WILL BE

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:30.137 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO LOOK TAKE A LOOK AT IT

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:32.306 region:rollup2
AS WELL ARE WE WERE GONNA AT THE

01:53:30.137 --> 01:53:33.940 region:rollup2

WORD FREE OR IN. TO ADDRESS THAT

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:37.077 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT WILL TAKE A

01:53:35.509 --> 01:53:38.345 region:rollup2
SECOND LOOK AT THE UP DISSECTION

01:53:37.077 --> 01:53:40.280 region:rollup2
THAT'S A. SECTION SIX AS YOU

01:53:38.345 --> 01:53:41.782 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ARE MORE CLOSELY AS WE

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:43.583 region:rollup2
GO BUT I DO WANT ADDRESS SOME OF

01:53:41.782 --> 01:53:45.152 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY

OPPOSITION AND. AND ALL ONE AT A

01:53:45.152 --> 01:53:49.222 region:rollup2
TIME AND A WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:50.590 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF PREEMPTION. OF FEDERAL

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:51.191 region:rollup2
LAWS PRETTY CLEAR IN FACT A

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:52.092 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW SAYS THAT THERE IS

01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:53.860 region:rollup2
A%

01:53:52.092 --> 01:53:54.861 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PREAMP THERE DURING

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.663 region:rollup2
SPRING I'M XIN OF STATE LAW

01:53:54.861 --> 01:54:00.367 region:rollup2
EXCEPT. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY

01:53:56.663 --> 01:54:01.401 region:rollup2
SUCH STATUTE REGULATION OR RULE

01:54:00.367 --> 01:54:02.969 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.637 region:rollup2
FALSE THE OR DECEPTION IN ANY

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:05.305 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE COMMERCIAL

ELECTRONIC EMAIL. AND THAT IS

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:09.109 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT AB TWENTY FIVE

01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:10.644 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX IS OPERATING UNDER IN

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:12.412 region:rollup2
FACT THAT'S TOTALLY CONSISTENT

01:54:10.644 --> 01:54:14.347 region:rollup2
WITH EXISTING LAW AND NOT SO.

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:16.049 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE THE CODE

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:18.652 region:rollup2
SECTION THAT I CITED EARLIER AW

01:54:16.049 --> 01:54:19.853 region:rollup2
IS IN FACT A WITHIN THE CONFINES

01:54:18.652 --> 01:54:21.555 region:rollup2
OF DOT TO EXCEPTION.

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:23.857 region:rollup2
NOW WITH RESPECT ALSO WE HOW THE

THAT'S BILLION SO IN THE EVENT

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:28.795 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS ANY QUESTIONS ARE

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:30.297 region:rollup2
WE COULD. A TAKE OUT ANY

01:54:28.795 --> 01:54:32.733 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT MAY BE DEEMED A

01:54:30.297 --> 01:54:34.868 region:rollup2
PREEMPTIVE. AND WITH RESPECT TO

01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:36.603 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF DUPLICATION. OB

01:54:34.868 --> 01:54:37.170 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:39.339 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:41.341 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ALREADY ARE CURRENTLY.

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:42.809 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:45.512 region:rollup2
STANDING TO BRING AN ACTION ARE

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:45.846 region:rollup2
ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD

01:54:45.512 --> 01:54:46.646 region:rollup2
DO THAT. AND.

01:54:45.846 --> 01:54:48.715 region:rollup2
.

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:49.783 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT DID THE ATTORNEY

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:52.686 region:rollup2
GENERAL HAS NOT BROUGHT FORTH A

01:54:49.783 --> 01:54:54.087 region:rollup2
LOT OF CASES OVER THE YEARS AND

01:54:52.686 --> 01:54:55.522 region:rollup2
THE FTC HAS ALSO BEEN MISSION.

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:58.725 region:rollup2
ONLY BRINGS A HANDFUL OF CASES

01:54:55.522 --> 01:55:00.093 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR SO THIS LAW WILL GIVE

01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:02.429 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL OR THAT THE

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:03.530 region:rollup2
VICTIM OF THE YOU KNOW STANDING

01:55:02.429 --> 01:55:05.665 region:rollup2
TO BRING A LAWSUIT.

01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:08.068 region:rollup2
TO RECOVER DAMAGES NOW WITH

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:10.804 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:55:08.068 --> 01:55:11.471 region:rollup2
ACTION THAT IS ALREADY EXISTING

01:55:10.804 --> 01:55:11.805 region:rollup2
LAW I MEAN WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:13.774 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO.

01:55:11.805 --> 01:55:16.476 region:rollup2
TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:55:13.774 --> 01:55:16.877 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE NOW TO

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.278 region:rollup2
THE POINT BEING.

01:55:16.877 --> 01:55:20.881 region:rollup2
AT SEA.

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:23.150 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A FOURTH POINT OF THE

01:55:20.881 --> 01:55:24.418 region:rollup2
OUR. IMPACT ON THE.

01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:26.153 region:rollup2
.

01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:27.854 region:rollup2
OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS FOCUSING ON

01:55:26.153 --> 01:55:29.856 region:rollup2
THE UNSOLICITED EMAILS NOT NOT

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:32.826 region:rollup2
SO MUCH THE SOLICITED ONES. ARE

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:35.395 region:rollup2
NOW IN FACT I THINK GO BACK A

01:55:32.826 --> 01:55:37.431 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AGO THE IT.

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:39.199 region:rollup2
SIDE THEY DID A STUDY I THINK OF

01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:40.033 region:rollup2
ALL THE EMAIL TRAFFIC SIXTY FIVE

01:55:39.199 --> 01:55:42.602 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE TRAFFIC

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:43.170 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTE A SPAM EMAIL.

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:45.972 region:rollup2
SO THAT GOES TO SPEAK TO THE

01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:47.440 region:rollup2
OUR.

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:49.176 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE STILL HAVE ON

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.976 region:rollup2
OUR HANDS.

01:55:49.176 --> 01:55:50.844 region:rollup2
AND.

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:53.280 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:55:50.844 --> 01:55:54.481 region:rollup2
DOES BUT I AM COMMITTED TO

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:57.617 region:rollup2

ADDED I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:10.363 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE BILL BUT BECAUSE IT

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:11.598 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY A PART OF STATE LAW

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.766 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT'S NOT PART OF THE

01:56:11.598 --> 01:56:13.667 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING BUT. I

THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE I

01:56:26.446 --> 01:56:28.448 region:rollup2
THINK A LOT OF THE COMMENTS

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:30.116 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:32.052 region:rollup2
MISTER WANT OBERNOLTE MADE.

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:33.086 region:rollup2
WERE VERY VALID I THINK THERE'S

01:56:32.052 --> 01:56:34.321 region:rollup2
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:35.856 region:rollup2
BILL BUT I THINK THAT A LOT SOME

01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:37.224 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY

01:56:35.856 --> 01:56:39.626 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION. ARE VALID.

01:56:37.224 --> 01:56:40.861 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:56:39.626 --> 01:56:42.429 region:rollup2
WHILE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE

01:56:40.861 --> 01:56:43.330 region:rollup2
BILL TODAY IF THIS WERE THE

01:56:42.429 --> 01:56:43.897 region:rollup2
VERSION ON THE FLOOR I PROBABLY

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:45.699 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T.

01:56:43.897 --> 01:56:47.100 region:rollup2
AND SO REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:56:45.699 --> 01:56:48.468 region:rollup2
YOU TO WORK WITH.

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.136 region:rollup2
IN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS.

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:51.872 region:rollup2
TO HEAR THEM OUT AND SEE WHAT

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:53.373 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO TO ALLEVIATE.

01:56:51.872 --> 01:56:55.375 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:58.245 region:rollup2
RAISED WILL DO JUST THAT AND

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:58.945 region:rollup2
WILL REACH OUT YOUR OFFICE AS

01:56:58.245 --> 01:57:01.114 region:rollup2
WELL PERFECT THAT THANK YOU*

01:56:58.945 --> 01:57:02.582 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:03.250 region:rollup2
ONE CLARIFICATION SO THERE SEEMS

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.351 region:rollup2
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISPUTE

01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:06.653 region:rollup2
AS TO WHETHER THIS BILL CREATES

01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:08.088 region:rollup2
A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS

01:57:06.653 --> 01:57:10.457 region:rollup2
IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING MR CHOW

01:57:08.088 --> 01:57:13.026 region:rollup2
THAT IT. THAT IT DOES. NO IT

01:57:10.457 --> 01:57:13.827 region:rollup2
DOES NOT THAT'S IN EXISTING LAW.

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:14.728 region:rollup2
MINE DOES MY UNDERSTANDING AND

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:17.163 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION DO YOU AGREE WITH

01:57:14.728 --> 01:57:18.865 region:rollup2
THAT OR NOT.

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:21.801 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK THAT IT IN MY

01:57:18.865 --> 01:57:24.170 region:rollup2
VIEW OF AS WE LOOK AT IT.

01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:26.606 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE LAW CAN BE

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:27.807 region:rollup2
ENFORCED THROUGH EXISTING STATE

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:29.042 region:rollup2
LAW SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH

01:57:27.807 --> 01:57:30.410 region:rollup2
IS.

01:57:29.042 --> 01:57:30.911 region:rollup2
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:32.345 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:57:30.911 --> 01:57:35.015 region:rollup2
.

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:36.550 region:rollup2
WHAT? I THINK THE CONCERN THAT

01:57:35.015 --> 01:57:38.118 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ON HERE IS THAT WE HAVE

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:40.787 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR

01:57:38.118 --> 01:57:41.021 region:rollup2
WHICH NO DAMAGES NEED.

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:43.023 region:rollup2
PROVEN.

01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:43.990 region:rollup2
UNDER SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED YOU

01:57:43.023 --> 01:57:46.259 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOW DAMAGE.

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:47.928 region:rollup2
.

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:49.429 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE WELL I'M WRESTLING

01:57:47.928 --> 01:57:51.565 region:rollup2
WITH THAT NIGHT I BELIEVE THAT

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:52.999 region:rollup2
THAT IS A CONCERN THAT THAT SEE

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:55.302 region:rollup2
YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ADDS

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:57.037 region:rollup2
STATUTORY DAMAGES TO AN EXISTING

01:57:55.302 --> 01:57:58.071 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHERE

01:57:57.037 --> 01:57:58.605 region:rollup2
THOSE DAMAGES ARE NOT CURRENTLY

01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:00.206 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. THAT'S WHAT WE

01:57:58.605 --> 01:58:01.207 region:rollup2
BELIEVE.

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:02.275 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THAT MR TRUMP WE

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:04.377 region:rollup2
ARE GIVING STANDING TO

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:05.512 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ON THE LAW AND THE

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:07.414 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW WOULD NOT ADDING ANY

01:58:05.512 --> 01:58:08.949 region:rollup2
PRIOR WRITER ACTION TO. TO THE

01:58:07.414 --> 01:58:10.183 region:rollup2
BILL I MEAN YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN

01:58:08.949 --> 01:58:12.018 region:rollup2
NOTICING THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:13.086 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:14.688 region:rollup2
THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOR RIGHT NOW

01:58:13.086 --> 01:58:16.323 region:rollup2
PRIDE RIGHT I THINK HIS POINT IS

01:58:14.688 --> 01:58:18.425 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ABOUT CREATES A NEW

01:58:16.323 --> 01:58:19.225 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATUTORY

01:58:18.425 --> 01:58:21.261 region:rollup2
DAMAGES AYE EE.

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:22.963 region:rollup2
DAMAGES THAT PROOF OF HARM

01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:24.364 region:rollup2
EITHER NOT AVAILABLE UNDER THE

01:58:22.963 --> 01:58:27.367 region:rollup2
EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:58:24.364 --> 01:58:28.768 region:rollup2
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT.

01:58:27.367 --> 01:58:29.970 region:rollup2
I.

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.637 region:rollup2
I CAN LOOK INTO SOME MORE BUT I

01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:31.304 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS

01:58:30.637 --> 01:58:33.306 region:rollup2
THE CASE BUT THAT THAT SEVENTEEN

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:34.207 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED IS A. IS.

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:36.209 region:rollup2
WHAT GIVES?

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:39.846 region:rollup2
?

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:41.748 region:rollup2
DID YOU HAVE THE PROGRAM AGES.

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:42.716 region:rollup2
RIGHT PASSED SO DOES THAT

01:58:41.748 --> 01:58:42.916 region:rollup2
RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS OF THAT

01:58:42.716 --> 01:58:44.751 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:58:42.916 --> 01:58:45.652 region:rollup2
.

01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:47.988 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS WHAT WE'VE

01:58:45.652 --> 01:58:50.423 region:rollup2
EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF

01:58:47.988 --> 01:58:51.858 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA CANSPAM ACT FAIRLY

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:52.792 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT MAKE BY ADDING THAT

01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:54.527 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK TRIGGERS RIGHT

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:56.029 region:rollup2
WHICH. AGAIN WE BELIEVE IT IS

01:58:54.527 --> 01:58:58.565 region:rollup2
ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE

01:58:56.029 --> 01:58:59.199 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW MOVIE THINK THOSE

01:58:58.565 --> 01:59:00.133 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE COVERED UNDER FEDERAL

01:58:59.199 --> 01:59:01.768 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:59:00.133 --> 01:59:03.436 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:59:01.768 --> 01:59:05.205 region:rollup2
.

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.405 region:rollup2
IT CAN ONLY BE ENFORCED UNDER.

01:59:05.205 --> 01:59:07.207 region:rollup2
UNDER.

01:59:05.405 --> 01:59:08.241 region:rollup2
.

01:59:07.207 --> 01:59:10.343 region:rollup2
AND UNDER THE CAN SPAM ACT BY

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:11.811 region:rollup2
THE AG EMAIL PROVIDER AND A

01:59:10.343 --> 01:59:13.713 region:rollup2
RECIPIENT OF THE EMAIL THIS

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:15.181 region:rollup2
EXPANDS THE UNIVERSE OF THOSE

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:17.684 region:rollup2
WHO CAN BRING ACTIONS.

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:19.452 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK THEY HAD ALWAYS

01:59:17.684 --> 01:59:21.521 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO BRING ACTIONS UNDER

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:22.989 region:rollup2
THE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES

01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:24.124 region:rollup2
STATUTES SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:26.359 region:rollup2
WHICH REQUIRES A SHOWING OF

01:59:24.124 --> 01:59:29.362 region:rollup2
DAMAGES MIGHT. CONCERN HERE IS

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:32.465 region:rollup2
THAT THIS NEW THIS. LANGUAGE

01:59:29.362 --> 01:59:34.768 region:rollup2
HERE ALLOWS AN ACTION TO BE

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:35.368 region:rollup2
BROUGHT WITHOUT. HIM THAT'S

01:59:34.768 --> 01:59:36.870 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I'M WRESTLING WITH

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:39.873 region:rollup2
THE LIGHT.

01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:41.408 region:rollup2
IF I COULD ASK MY WHEN IT'S

01:59:39.873 --> 01:59:42.108 region:rollup2
TAKEN REFUSER US I TWENTY BE

01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:42.776 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:43.910 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW ALREADY HAS A

01:59:42.776 --> 01:59:45.712 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:47.347 region:rollup2
STATUTORY DAMAGES IT'S ALREADY

01:59:45.712 --> 01:59:48.248 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:59:47.347 --> 01:59:50.083 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS AMENDMENT DOES IT DOES

01:59:48.248 --> 01:59:51.851 region:rollup2
NOT ADD STANDING IT DOES NOT ADD

01:59:50.083 --> 01:59:54.354 region:rollup2
STATUTORY DAMAGES THE ONLY THING

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:56.256 region:rollup2
IT DOES IS PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES

01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:58.658 region:rollup2
AND CLARIFICATIONS OF WHAT WOULD

01:59:56.256 --> 02:00:00.226 region:rollup2
VIOLATE THE STATUTE? ARM AND IT

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:02.228 region:rollup2
HOLDS THE SENDER'S LIABLE FOR

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:03.229 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HITTING THE SEND BUTTON

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:05.465 region:rollup2
WITH THESE FALSE DIDN'T

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:07.067 region:rollup2
DECEPTIVE CLAIMS. THERE'S SIMPLY

02:00:05.465 --> 02:00:07.634 region:rollup2
NO ADDITIONAL STANDING.

02:00:07.067 --> 02:00:09.669 region:rollup2
BEING PUT INTO PLACE BY THE

02:00:07.634 --> 02:00:10.270 region:rollup2
SPELL.

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:12.472 region:rollup2
I I I UNDERSTAND THAT POINT I

02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:13.540 region:rollup2
DO.

02:00:12.472 --> 02:00:15.275 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S.

02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:16.276 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE BILL

02:00:15.275 --> 02:00:18.144 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF

02:00:16.276 --> 02:00:19.412 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL LITIGATION.

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:21.247 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION.

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:21.981 region:rollup2
HAVING NO CONSUMER ATTORNEYS

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:22.816 region:rollup2
USUALLY DON'T SHOPPERS FOR

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:24.284 region:rollup2
THINGS THE RESULT IN LESS

02:00:22.816 --> 02:00:25.985 region:rollup2
LITIGATION AND.

02:00:24.284 --> 02:00:26.953 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THIS DOES NOT

02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:28.088 region:rollup2
CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:00:26.953 --> 02:00:29.656 region:rollup2
ACTION OR EVEN IF IT DOESN'T

02:00:28.088 --> 02:00:30.990 region:rollup2
CREATE A NEW TYPE OF DAMAGES IT

02:00:29.656 --> 02:00:32.092 region:rollup2
DOES.

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:33.626 region:rollup2
WHY DID THE AMBIT OF THE

02:00:32.092 --> 02:00:35.795 region:rollup2
EXISTING CAUSE OF ACTION?

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:37.363 region:rollup2
AND THAT SO MISTER I CHAO FROM

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:39.065 region:rollup2
A YOU KNOW.

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:40.800 region:rollup2

ALTHOUGH MY G. MALES SPAM

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:45.338 region:rollup2
FILTER SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY

02:00:44.838 --> 02:00:48.074 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:49.509 region:rollup2
BUT I I YOU KNOW AND THERE ARE

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:51.578 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF NICE LITTLE HOOKS

02:00:49.509 --> 02:00:52.812 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THE LAW FOR AND YOU

02:00:51.578 --> 02:00:54.614 region:rollup2
KNOW ATTORNEYS TO GO OUT THERE

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:55.448 region:rollup2
AND MAKE MONEY OFF OF SPAM I'VE

02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.516 region:rollup2
SEEN AT THERE'S A COTTAGE

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:58.017 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP

02:00:56.516 --> 02:00:58.985 region:rollup2
AROUND IT. AYE THEY GO OUT THERE

02:00:58.017 --> 02:01:00.954 region:rollup2
AND SEARCH FOR POTENTIAL

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:02.655 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO

02:01:00.954 --> 02:01:04.190 region:rollup2
A POTENTIAL VIOLATION AND THEY

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:05.325 region:rollup2
SAY WITHOUT ANY NEED TO REALLY

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:07.260 region:rollup2
PROVE THERE'S BEEN.

02:01:05.325 --> 02:01:08.561 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON A SUFFRAGAN ANYWAY

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.929 region:rollup2
AND I REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD IN

02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:12.132 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HAVE SOME.

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:14.033 region:rollup2
CRISIS OF OF PEOPLE BEING

02:01:12.132 --> 02:01:15.935 region:rollup2
DEFRAUDED BY BY SPAM GOING ON IN

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:17.704 region:rollup2
THE STATE SO WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:18.738 region:rollup2
PROOF OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS

02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:20.940 region:rollup2
I'M PRETTY WARY.

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:22.809 region:rollup2
TO OPEN UP EVEN MORE AVENUES

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:24.077 region:rollup2
FOR OUR WHAT IS OFTEN QUITE

02:01:22.809 --> 02:01:24.744 region:rollup2
FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION SO I DO

APPRECIATE.

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:27.747 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE BILL

02:01:26.713 --> 02:01:30.049 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND

02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:40.760 region:rollup2
A NO VOTE AND.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:42.328 region:rollup2

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:55.661 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

02:08:54.594 --> 02:08:57.697 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:58.998 region:rollup2
ITS IMPRINT THE NEW MARK UP THAT

02:08:57.697 --> 02:09:01.601 region:rollup2
YOU SEE TODAY.

02:08:58.998 --> 02:09:02.835 region:rollup2

HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO FULLY VET.

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:05.771 region:rollup2
EVERY PIECE OF THAT MARKUP.

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:07.673 region:rollup2
.

02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:09.041 region:rollup2
AND THE NEW FOCUS IS MORE ON THE

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:10.576 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SERVICE OF WHAT THE

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:12.144 region:rollup2
SENATE PLATFORMS DO.

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:13.479 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:15.181 region:rollup2
THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THE

02:09:13.479 --> 02:09:15.681 region:rollup2
COMPANIES CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR

02:09:15.181 --> 02:09:17.316 region:rollup2
VIOLATING THEIR TERMS OF

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:19.485 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:20.586 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO WITH THIS VERSION

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:22.722 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TO DO SO THAT'S ALREADY

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:23.022 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

02:09:22.722 --> 02:09:24.724 region:rollup2
IN FURTHER.

02:09:23.022 --> 02:09:26.559 region:rollup2
.

02:09:24.724 --> 02:09:28.461 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH OF FOCUSING ON

02:09:26.559 --> 02:09:28.661 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SERVICE MAY FORCE.

02:09:28.461 --> 02:09:30.830 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:09:28.661 --> 02:09:32.431 region:rollup2
.

02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:33.499 region:rollup2
POLICIES TO BE LONGER AND WE'RE

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.067 region:rollup2
NOT SURE THAT THAT WILL REALLY

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:36.969 region:rollup2
RESULT MORE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:37.837 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS.

02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2

02:09:44.477 --> 02:09:48.514 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN

MEMBERS WE DO STILL HAVE

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.170 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WERE AS WHETHER THEY

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:13.773 region:rollup2

JAMES I.

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:25.451 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOU WAITING IN THIS

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.819 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IT IS AN IMPORTANT

02:10:25.451 --> 02:10:27.586 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I WHAT I WILL SAY

02:10:26.819 --> 02:10:30.089 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL RAISES.

02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:31.557 region:rollup2
.

02:10:30.089 --> 02:10:33.325 region:rollup2
THIS NEED TO BE DISCUSSED.

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:34.193 region:rollup2
WE NEED A LARGER CONVERSATION

02:10:33.325 --> 02:10:35.761 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT ROLE WEBSITES A

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:36.896 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:38.297 region:rollup2
SHOULD PLAY IN MAINTAINING

02:10:36.896 --> 02:10:40.333 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FORMS. OF WHAT

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:41.867 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY DO THEY HAVE FOR

02:10:40.333 --> 02:10:43.369 region:rollup2
FALSE OR MISLEADING CONTENT WHAT

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:45.037 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY DO THEY HAVE TO

02:10:43.369 --> 02:10:46.505 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SPACE FOR THOUGHTFUL

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:48.374 region:rollup2
FACT BASED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:49.575 region:rollup2
POLITICS AND POLICY. WHAT DOES

02:10:48.374 --> 02:10:51.677 region:rollup2
THAT MEAN FOR CONTENT THAT

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:54.113 region:rollup2
DISTRACTS FROM? THAT DISCUSSION

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:55.481 region:rollup2
OR IS FALSE OBSCENE OR IS BASED

02:10:54.113 --> 02:10:57.383 region:rollup2
ON HATRED.

02:10:55.481 --> 02:10:58.884 region:rollup2
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE

02:10:57.383 --> 02:11:01.454 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH.

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:04.557 region:rollup2
WHICH I DO HOPE THAT THIS BILL.

02:11:01.454 --> 02:11:06.459 region:rollup2
LEADS TO PASS SOME CONCERNS

02:11:04.557 --> 02:11:06.992 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE ABOUT THIS BILL IS

02:11:06.459 --> 02:11:08.427 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN IT COMES THAT

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:09.862 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS THIS BILL

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:11.030 region:rollup2
ADVANCING THAT CONVERSATION AND

02:11:09.862 --> 02:11:12.832 region:rollup2
SO I WHILE I PREVIOUS.

02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:14.066 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT

02:11:12.832 --> 02:11:16.936 region:rollup2
REMOVE SEARCH ENGINES.

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:19.138 region:rollup2
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

02:11:16.936 --> 02:11:21.073 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMILARLY ON WORKABLE FOR

02:11:19.138 --> 02:11:22.308 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND SO MY

02:11:21.073 --> 02:11:24.009 region:rollup2
FEAR IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN

02:11:22.308 --> 02:11:24.944 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:26.712 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKING IT MORE

02:11:24.944 --> 02:11:28.948 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO REMOVE OBSCENE

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:30.516 region:rollup2
HATEFUL OR VIOLENT OR. A VIOLENT

02:11:28.948 --> 02:11:31.984 region:rollup2
OR OTHER CONTENT THAT VIOLATES

02:11:30.516 --> 02:11:33.953 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

02:11:31.984 --> 02:11:35.221 region:rollup2
IN MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT

02:11:33.953 --> 02:11:36.856 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE COULD FORCE

02:11:35.221 --> 02:11:38.524 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS TO MAINTAIN CONTENT

02:11:36.856 --> 02:11:39.625 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DISAGREE WITH. WHICH

02:11:38.524 --> 02:11:41.327 region:rollup2
WOULD SEEM TO ME AT GOVERNMENTAL

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.961 region:rollup2
REGULATION OF SPEECH AND SO I

02:11:41.327 --> 02:11:44.163 region:rollup2
THINK THE POINT I'M TRYING TO

02:11:41.961 --> 02:11:45.865 region:rollup2
MAKE IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE YOU

02:11:44.163 --> 02:11:47.400 region:rollup2
KNOW THE FREEDOM. YOU KNOW THE

02:11:45.865 --> 02:11:48.834 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH TO SAY YOU

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.136 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT WE WHAT WE LIKE

02:11:48.834 --> 02:11:51.771 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A FREE SPEECH SSUE

02:11:50.136 --> 02:11:52.371 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE COMPANIES

02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:53.172 region:rollup2
IN THESE PLATFORMS BEING ABLE

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:55.541 region:rollup2
TO.

02:11:53.172 --> 02:11:56.842 region:rollup2
ARE NOT. LET THEIR PLATFORM

02:11:55.541 --> 02:11:58.544 region:rollup2
PROMOTE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:59.078 region:rollup2
JUST THAT THAT THAT THEY DON'T

02:11:58.544 --> 02:12:01.013 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH.

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:01.981 region:rollup2
IN THAT I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN

02:12:01.013 --> 02:12:03.048 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN ITCOMES TO BULLYING

02:12:01.981 --> 02:12:05.484 region:rollup2
THREATS.

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:07.286 region:rollup2
HATE SPEECH.

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:10.389 region:rollup2
WHAT I DON'T ONE IS I I THINK

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:11.590 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE IN THIS

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:13.626 region:rollup2
ROOM YOU INCLUDED THAT?

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:15.628 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT OUR TO CREATE A

02:12:13.626 --> 02:12:17.463 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD THESE

02:12:15.628 --> 02:12:19.465 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS COULD BE SUED. BOB

02:12:17.463 --> 02:12:22.568 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY REMOVED CONTENT

02:12:19.465 --> 02:12:24.303 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A SPECIFICALLY MEANT TO

02:12:22.568 --> 02:12:26.972 region:rollup2
BE A SOME TYPE OF HATE SPEECH

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:28.207 region:rollup2
WILL MORE THREATENING OR WAS.

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:31.010 region:rollup2
WAS A BULLYING.

02:12:28.207 --> 02:12:32.912 region:rollup2
INCIDENT I AND SO THAT IS A

02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:35.080 region:rollup2
MAJOR CONCERN THAT I HAVE.

02:12:32.912 --> 02:12:36.515 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I I'VE

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.883 region:rollup2
HEARD SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS.

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:39.952 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WHAT ABOUT ALL THE

02:12:37.883 --> 02:12:40.586 region:rollup2
POSITIVE STUFF ON TRUMP OUT

02:12:39.952 --> 02:12:41.687 region:rollup2
THERE JUST KEEPS GETTING VERY

02:12:40.586 --> 02:12:43.422 region:rollup2
BLACK TIGHTS NOT THERE BECAUSE

02:12:41.687 --> 02:12:45.558 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T EXIST BUT. I WILL SAY

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:50.396 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:12:45.558 --> 02:12:50.830 region:rollup2
YOU SAY SO THAT.

02:12:50.396 --> 02:12:54.300 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:56.669 region:rollup2
BUT BUT IF YOU KNOW.

02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:57.903 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT IDEA OR THAT

02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:59.672 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF POLITICAL.

02:12:57.903 --> 02:13:01.040 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:12:59.672 --> 02:13:03.275 region:rollup2
POLITICAL RELEVANCE THAT

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.211 region:rollup2
POLITICAL SPEECH WHAT DOES THAT

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:07.713 region:rollup2
MEAN BECAUSE SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW

02:13:05.211 --> 02:13:09.548 region:rollup2
WHO IS IS ENGAGING IN HATE

02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:12.384 region:rollup2
SPEECH OR OR RHETORIC THAT'S

02:13:09.548 --> 02:13:14.253 region:rollup2
GOING TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE.

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:16.555 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE THIS PLATFORM MAY

02:13:14.253 --> 02:13:17.590 region:rollup2
THINK OKAY THIS NEEDS TO BE

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:20.059 region:rollup2
REMOVED BECAUSE THERE CAN BE

02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:21.994 region:rollup2
HARM A NOW THEY'RE. THEY'RE

02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:25.397 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE ARGUED WHILE I'M

A CONVERSATION THAT'S REALLY

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:48.280 region:rollup2

THAT THAT THEY DO THAT TO ME

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:19.611 region:rollup2

02:18:31.003 --> 02:18:34.006 region:rollup2
IS SOME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE ARE

02:18:32.538 --> 02:18:36.175 region:rollup2
THOSE LINES ARE CONTINUALLY

02:18:34.006 --> 02:18:37.509 region:rollup2
BEING DRAWN RIGHT. BUT WHAT WE

02:18:36.175 --> 02:18:38.844 region:rollup2
DO OPEN UP A PUBLIC FORUM WE

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:39.978 region:rollup2
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT SPEECH

02:18:38.844 --> 02:18:41.280 region:rollup2
IS PROTECTED.

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:43.649 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO ALREADY HAVE THE

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.617 region:rollup2
LEGAL PARAMETERS IN PLACE TO TO

02:18:43.649 --> 02:18:47.286 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT THINGS AND PRIVATE

02:18:45.617 --> 02:18:48.921 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES WOULD BE. WELL WITHIN

02:18:47.286 --> 02:18:51.924 region:rollup2
THEIR RIGHTS TO PROHIBIT THINGS

02:18:48.921 --> 02:18:54.126 region:rollup2
THAT ARE INCITEMENT OBSCENITY.

02:18:51.924 --> 02:18:55.827 region:rollup2
AND DEFAMATION.

02:18:54.126 --> 02:18:57.496 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THERE'S THERE'S THINGS

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:59.031 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT PROTECTED SPEECH

02:18:57.496 --> 02:18:59.665 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE

02:18:59.031 --> 02:19:01.366 region:rollup2
ALREADY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO

02:18:59.665 --> 02:19:02.701 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT. AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO

02:19:01.366 --> 02:19:04.503 region:rollup2
BUILD AN ADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:06.238 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR TERMS.

02:19:04.503 --> 02:19:07.573 region:rollup2
A OF SERVICES LONG AS THAT'S

02:19:06.238 --> 02:19:09.341 region:rollup2
CLEAR SO THE CONSUMER KNOWS HEY

02:19:07.573 --> 02:19:10.442 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M USING THIS.

02:19:09.341 --> 02:19:11.977 region:rollup2
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:13.912 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PROHIBITED.

02:19:11.977 --> 02:19:16.615 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE

02:19:13.912 --> 02:19:17.916 region:rollup2
IS AN OPEN FORUM BUT THEN IF WE

02:19:16.615 --> 02:19:18.483 region:rollup2
DON'T LIKE IN CERTAIN CASES

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:20.052 region:rollup2
MAYBE IF WE DON'T LIKE YOUR

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:21.220 region:rollup2
SPEECH.

02:19:20.052 --> 02:19:22.521 region:rollup2
WILL SUPPRESS IT AND THAT

02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:24.022 region:rollup2
BECOMES DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN

02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:25.591 region:rollup2
OUR MODERN ERA.

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:27.693 region:rollup2
WELL WE WANT A FREE FLOWING

02:19:25.591 --> 02:19:29.795 region:rollup2
DEBATE RIGHT WE WANT TO HAVE A

02:19:27.693 --> 02:19:31.029 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF IDEAS EXPRESSED.

02:19:29.795 --> 02:19:32.631 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE THOSE THAT ARE NOT

02:19:31.029 --> 02:19:34.166 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEAS CAN ALSO BE CALLED

02:19:32.631 --> 02:19:36.235 region:rollup2
OUT RIGHT IN THE MARKETPLACE OF

02:19:34.166 --> 02:19:37.436 region:rollup2
ABOUT A OF IDEAS WILL FIND THE

02:19:36.235 --> 02:19:39.504 region:rollup2
FALSE.

02:19:37.436 --> 02:19:41.406 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S ALSO

02:19:39.504 --> 02:19:42.841 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM OF PEOPLE BECOMING

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:44.543 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY MORE INSULAR ON

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:45.844 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES RIGHT YEAH LIKE THEY

02:19:44.543 --> 02:19:47.846 region:rollup2
WERE ONLY WANT TO HEAR THIS.

02:19:45.844 --> 02:19:48.680 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE

02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:50.916 region:rollup2
THIS MORE LAUGHTER IT'S MORE

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.584 region:rollup2
RIGHT. AT LEAST ONE THING THAT

02:19:50.916 --> 02:19:54.353 region:rollup2
WE SAW WITH THE WHOLE. NOT YOU

02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:55.988 region:rollup2

02:19:54.353 --> 02:19:57.789 region:rollup2
A DATE THEY FOOLED PEOPLE ON

02:19:55.988 --> 02:19:59.958 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES RIGHT WITH WITH FALSE

02:19:57.789 --> 02:20:00.993 region:rollup2
STORIES THEY GOT PEOPLE FIRED UP

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:04.062 region:rollup2
ON THE LEFT AND THEY GOT PEOPLE

02:20:00.993 --> 02:20:05.330 region:rollup2
FIRED UP. ON THE RIGHT IN AND

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:06.965 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OUT OF WE HAVE TO BE

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:09.268 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF HALEY SINGS ARE BEING

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:10.636 region:rollup2
USED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE.

02:20:09.268 --> 02:20:12.170 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

02:20:10.636 --> 02:20:14.873 region:rollup2
PROTECT A FREE FLOWING.

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:15.707 region:rollup2
DEBATE OF IDEAS AND THAT'S WHY

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:17.276 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO GO AT THIS BILL.

02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:18.944 region:rollup2
.

02:20:17.276 --> 02:20:20.245 region:rollup2
WHILE ALSO PROTECTING AGAINST

02:20:18.944 --> 02:20:22.581 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW OUR ARE

02:20:20.245 --> 02:20:23.382 region:rollup2
NOT PROTECTED SPEECH.

02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:24.449 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAYBE A QUESTION FOR

02:20:23.382 --> 02:20:26.451 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION YOU DON'T MIND

02:20:24.449 --> 02:20:27.886 region:rollup2
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MONOPOLIZING

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:29.254 region:rollup2
THE TIME HERE FROM THE UP TO THE

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:30.489 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW WHAT WITH

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:31.390 region:rollup2
WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE TERMS

02:20:30.489 --> 02:20:33.458 region:rollup2
AND USES.

02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:33.959 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THE SERVICE

02:20:33.458 --> 02:20:35.360 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

02:20:33.959 --> 02:20:36.995 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T DOES THAT CHANGE THE

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.663 region:rollup2
CALCULUS WHEN IT COMES TO

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:39.298 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:20:37.663 --> 02:20:39.865 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WE

02:20:39.298 --> 02:20:41.099 region:rollup2
NEED TO EXAMINE THIS MORE I

02:20:39.865 --> 02:20:41.767 region:rollup2
MEAN.

02:20:41.099 --> 02:20:42.434 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE DOES THAT PUT YOU

02:20:41.767 --> 02:20:45.103 region:rollup2
GUYS.

02:20:42.434 --> 02:20:47.272 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MOST LIKELY ON THE

02:20:45.103 --> 02:20:49.207 region:rollup2
BILL. YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THAT.

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:50.242 region:rollup2
WELL THE.

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.843 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS ON TERMS SERVICE I

02:20:50.242 --> 02:20:52.477 region:rollup2
THINK IS A POSITIVE CHANGE FOR

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:54.680 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:56.715 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO PIECES OF THE BILL

02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:58.150 region:rollup2
ONE ON CENSORING REMOVING

02:20:56.715 --> 02:20:59.117 region:rollup2
CONTENT WHICH SEEMS TO BE MOST

02:20:58.150 --> 02:21:00.852 region:rollup2
OF THE DISCUSSION DAYS FOCUSED

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:03.221 region:rollup2
ON. THE SECOND PIECE IS

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:03.755 region:rollup2
MANIPULATING THE CONTENT AND

02:21:03.221 --> 02:21:04.856 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PART OF HIM STILL

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.657 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:07.826 region:rollup2
HAS AN ISSUE.

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:09.394 region:rollup2
WITH THE TERMS OF SERVICE

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:11.296 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANIPULATING CAN MEAN

02:21:09.394 --> 02:21:11.897 region:rollup2
ONE THING FOR THE AUTHOR'S

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:13.231 region:rollup2
INTENT BY I THINK WHERE HE'S

02:21:11.897 --> 02:21:15.233 region:rollup2
GOING.

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:17.302 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO COULD BE JUST WHAT

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:18.937 region:rollup2
THE PLATFORM SHOW CUSTOMERS WHAT

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:21.106 region:rollup2
THESE USES THE PLATFORM'S WANT

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:22.574 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW THE ALGORITHMS WORK

02:21:21.106 --> 02:21:23.709 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I SEEN.

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:25.010 region:rollup2
SO.

02:21:23.709 --> 02:21:26.178 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THE TERMS OF

02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:28.513 region:rollup2
SERVICE TODAY REALLY GET INTO

02:21:26.178 --> 02:21:30.182 region:rollup2
ALL THAT.

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:31.483 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE THING I MOVED

02:21:30.182 --> 02:21:32.317 region:rollup2
TO MY OPENING.

02:21:31.483 --> 02:21:34.086 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:35.821 region:rollup2
THE TERMS OF SERVICE MAY HAVE

02:21:34.086 --> 02:21:37.889 region:rollup2
TO BECOME MUCH LONGER WHICH IS

02:21:35.821 --> 02:21:40.258 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY. HAS.

02:21:37.889 --> 02:21:40.926 region:rollup2
HAD ISSUES WITH IN THE PAST.

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:42.627 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT SURE THAT REALLY

02:21:40.926 --> 02:21:44.363 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHED TRANSPARENCY I

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:45.764 region:rollup2
THINK THE AUTHORS GOING AFTER SO

02:21:44.363 --> 02:21:48.133 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO

02:21:45.764 --> 02:21:49.334 region:rollup2
LOOK AT GOING FORWARD.

02:21:48.133 --> 02:21:50.402 region:rollup2
MARIAH AT MA'AM I IT I KEEP

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:52.137 region:rollup2
GETTING HUNG UP ON YOU KNOW

02:21:50.402 --> 02:21:53.805 region:rollup2

02:21:52.137 --> 02:21:54.773 region:rollup2
WHAT QUALIFIES UNDER POLITICAL

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:57.743 region:rollup2
SPEECH AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S

02:21:54.773 --> 02:21:59.311 region:rollup2
REALLY BROAD. AND OPENS UP A LOT

02:21:57.743 --> 02:22:01.613 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSATION.

02:21:59.311 --> 02:22:03.281 region:rollup2
OR A POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW I

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:05.384 region:rollup2
LITIGATION THAT AND THAT IS MY

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:07.586 region:rollup2
CONCERN I'D LIKE I JUST I DON'T

02:22:05.384 --> 02:22:09.454 region:rollup2
WANT US TO HANDCUFF OURSELVES.

02:22:07.586 --> 02:22:10.055 region:rollup2
AND HANDCUFF OUR STATE IN

02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:11.456 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

02:22:10.055 --> 02:22:13.792 region:rollup2
FOR BEING ABLE TO REMOVE

02:22:11.456 --> 02:22:15.961 region:rollup2
ATTENTION A DANGEROUS.

02:22:13.792 --> 02:22:16.962 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ONLINE I AM WITH YOU

02:22:15.961 --> 02:22:18.163 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GODLESS OF

02:22:16.962 --> 02:22:19.364 region:rollup2
WHAT SIDE IT'S ON YOU SHOULDN'T

02:22:18.163 --> 02:22:20.465 region:rollup2
BE SUPPRESSING.

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:22.401 region:rollup2
ANY TYPE OF.

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:23.602 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INFORMATION JUST

02:22:22.401 --> 02:22:24.169 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH IT

02:22:23.602 --> 02:22:25.537 region:rollup2
BEING WHAT YOU KNOW RIGHT OR

02:22:24.169 --> 02:22:27.272 region:rollup2
LEFT.

02:22:25.537 --> 02:22:29.041 region:rollup2
BUT I MEAN THAT BUT THAT'S NOT

02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:30.809 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WHAT MY CONCERN IS

02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:32.444 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE ARE WE HANDCUFFING

02:22:30.809 --> 02:22:35.414 region:rollup2
OURSELVES FROM BEING ABLE TO TO

02:22:32.444 --> 02:22:39.184 region:rollup2
REMOVE. THAT TYPE OF SPEECH ARE

02:22:35.414 --> 02:22:39.718 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD CAUSE HARM.

02:22:39.184 --> 02:22:41.620 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERY TIME IT WAS

02:22:39.718 --> 02:22:42.788 region:rollup2
BERMAN.

02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:44.189 region:rollup2

BILL IT'S IT IS A CRITICALLY.

02:22:46.091 --> 02:22:49.428 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:49.661 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I AND ONE

02:22:49.428 --> 02:22:51.763 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

02:22:49.661 --> 02:22:53.465 region:rollup2
.

02:22:51.763 --> 02:22:54.933 region:rollup2
STILL VERY CONFUSING.

02:22:53.465 --> 02:22:56.201 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW WE ADDRESS A

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:57.736 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE

02:22:56.201 --> 02:22:58.637 region:rollup2
YOUR RIGHT ARM. CHAIR OF THE

02:22:57.736 --> 02:23:00.305 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING

02:22:58.637 --> 02:23:00.839 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:02.841 region:rollup2
WE HAD THAT.

02:23:00.839 --> 02:23:05.343 region:rollup2
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING WITH

02:23:02.841 --> 02:23:06.578 region:rollup2
THE SENATE SIDE ON CYBERSECURITY

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:07.546 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND ELECTIONS AND A

02:23:06.578 --> 02:23:08.847 region:rollup2
LOT OF THAT IS THE

02:23:07.546 --> 02:23:10.415 region:rollup2
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. THAT

02:23:08.847 --> 02:23:11.450 region:rollup2
VARIOUS NEFARIOUS ACTORS ARE

02:23:10.415 --> 02:23:13.418 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA

02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:15.987 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS.

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:17.155 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS.

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:18.056 region:rollup2
THE HIGH LEVEL CONCERN I HAVE IS

02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:19.257 region:rollup2
I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:20.192 region:rollup2
DIGEST THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:22.394 region:rollup2
MADE THIS MORNING.

02:23:20.192 --> 02:23:23.028 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT GETS ME A LITTLE

02:23:22.394 --> 02:23:25.497 region:rollup2
BIT A PAUSE.

02:23:23.028 --> 02:23:27.966 region:rollup2
ON SUPPORTING SOMETHING TODAY.

02:23:25.497 --> 02:23:29.134 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IT'S UP.

02:23:27.966 --> 02:23:31.303 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO.

02:23:29.134 --> 02:23:32.871 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE I AGREE WITH THE GOAL

02:23:31.303 --> 02:23:35.307 region:rollup2
OF NOT WANTING TO?

02:23:32.871 --> 02:23:36.408 region:rollup2
INFRINGE ON ON POLITICAL SPEECH.

02:23:35.307 --> 02:23:37.876 region:rollup2
I STILL NEED TO WRAP MY HEAD

02:23:36.408 --> 02:23:40.645 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS IDEA THAT A SOCIAL

02:23:37.876 --> 02:23:43.048 region:rollup2
MEDIA SITE IS A PUBLIC FORUM.

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:43.648 region:rollup2
AND AND I DON'T YEAH IT IT'S A

02:23:43.048 --> 02:23:44.850 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I'D LOVE TO HAVE

02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:46.184 region:rollup2
MORE OF AND GET A BETTER

02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:47.552 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF BECAUSE I DON'T

02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:50.188 region:rollup2
THINK I'M FULLY THERE YET.

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:52.190 region:rollup2
BY BUT THEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:23:50.188 --> 02:23:53.058 region:rollup2
WE ARE ASKING OUR SOCIAL MEDIA

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:56.828 region:rollup2
COMPANIES

02:23:53.058 --> 02:23:58.163 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE DISCERNING. IN IN

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:59.865 region:rollup2
THAT TYPES OF OF

02:23:58.163 --> 02:24:01.867 region:rollup2
POSTS

02:23:59.865 --> 02:24:03.969 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING ON THEIR

02:24:01.867 --> 02:24:06.138 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS AND BOOSTING ON THEIR

02:24:03.969 --> 02:24:07.305 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS BECAUSE WE SAW. ON

02:24:06.138 --> 02:24:08.673 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES OF THAT.

02:24:07.305 --> 02:24:09.274 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS

02:24:08.673 --> 02:24:11.076 region:rollup2
MANIPULATION OF VOTERS ON BOTH

02:24:09.274 --> 02:24:13.145 region:rollup2
SIDES.

02:24:11.076 --> 02:24:15.480 region:rollup2
AND.

02:24:13.145 --> 02:24:16.515 region:rollup2
IN THEORY I LOVE THIS IDEA THAT

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.883 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF HE GETS OUT THERE

02:24:16.515 --> 02:24:19.351 region:rollup2
THAN PEOPLE WE WILL BE ABLE TO

02:24:17.883 --> 02:24:20.652 region:rollup2
TELL WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG. BUT

02:24:19.351 --> 02:24:22.387 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT WASN'T BORN

02:24:20.652 --> 02:24:24.055 region:rollup2
OUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN RESULTS

02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:25.257 region:rollup2
AND AND A LOT OF THE. THINGS

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:26.725 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED AFTER THE FACT AND

02:24:25.257 --> 02:24:27.559 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET

02:24:26.725 --> 02:24:29.494 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

02:24:27.559 --> 02:24:31.129 region:rollup2
MORE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:32.264 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE

02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:33.532 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

02:24:32.264 --> 02:24:37.369 region:rollup2
TO BETTER.

02:24:33.532 --> 02:24:38.570 region:rollup2
KIND OF REVIEW AND REGULATE.

02:24:37.369 --> 02:24:39.905 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE POSTS THAT ARE BEING

02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:41.640 region:rollup2
MADE THAT ARE WHO THAT I MADE

02:24:39.905 --> 02:24:42.807 region:rollup2
SOLELY WITH THE GOAL OF

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:45.810 region:rollup2
CONFUSING PEOPLE.

02:24:42.807 --> 02:24:48.246 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU KNOW MISINFORMING

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:49.681 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SO.

02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:50.782 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER SAYS WELL YOU

02:24:49.681 --> 02:24:53.685 region:rollup2
CAN'T YOU CAN'T.

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:55.020 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN'T. DIE

02:24:53.685 --> 02:24:56.288 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE EXACT TERMINOLOGY

02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:58.056 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE SOMETHING OR PULL IT

02:24:56.288 --> 02:24:58.924 region:rollup2
DOWN BY SOME POLITICAL SPEECH SO

02:24:58.056 --> 02:25:00.392 region:rollup2

THEN THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT TO

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:07.499 region:rollup2
DO IDEA HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:09.000 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL ON ABILITY AND

02:25:07.499 --> 02:25:11.102 region:rollup2

RIGHT AND AND I GUESS.

02:25:26.351 --> 02:25:30.522 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE STATUS QUO IS IS

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:32.857 region:rollup2
REALLY THAT DID THE COMPLETE AND

02:25:30.522 --> 02:25:33.892 region:rollup2
TOTAL THE SERMON IS IN THE HANDS

02:25:32.857 --> 02:25:36.161 region:rollup2
OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE

02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:37.529 region:rollup2
COMPANY. RAY I MEAN THEY DECIDE

02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:39.164 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO EITHER

02:25:37.529 --> 02:25:41.233 region:rollup2

02:25:57.649 --> 02:26:00.185 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:02.120 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY YOU KNOW IN OUR

02:26:00.185 --> 02:26:03.788 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS THAT WOULD WE ALLOW

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.957 region:rollup2
FREE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS

02:26:03.788 --> 02:26:08.193 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE THE FREE MARKETPLACE

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:10.428 region:rollup2
WILL EXPOSE THOSE IDEAS THAT.

02:26:08.193 --> 02:26:12.897 region:rollup2
ARE LESSER THEN AND WILL PROMOTE

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:14.666 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY.

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:15.967 region:rollup2
YOU THE GREATER GOOD RIGHT NOW

02:26:14.666 --> 02:26:17.569 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY PEOPLE WILL

SEE THAT THESE ARE THE.

02:26:17.569 --> 02:26:21.473 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE BETTER IDEAS IN

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:23.008 region:rollup2
THE WORKABLE IDEAS. AND YOU KNOW

02:26:21.473 --> 02:26:25.043 region:rollup2
THOSE WHEN THE DAY HOWEVER. YOU

02:26:23.008 --> 02:26:26.478 region:rollup2

02:26:25.043 --> 02:26:28.213 region:rollup2
WHERE FALSE THINGS HAVE BEEN PUT

02:26:26.478 --> 02:26:29.581 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:31.516 region:rollup2
I AM POLITICS THAT CERTAINLY

02:26:29.581 --> 02:26:33.585 region:rollup2
NOTHING NEW RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE

02:26:31.516 --> 02:26:35.153 region:rollup2
SEEN OF. AYE I THINK GOING BACK

02:26:33.585 --> 02:26:36.855 region:rollup2
TO OUR FOUNDERS WE HAD LETTER

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:37.956 region:rollup2
WRITERS WHO WOULD WRITE THINGS

02:26:36.855 --> 02:26:39.691 region:rollup2
THAT WERE.

02:26:37.956 --> 02:26:41.292 region:rollup2
NOT TRUE ABOUT CANDIDATES AND

02:26:39.691 --> 02:26:42.794 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT NOW EXISTS IN

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:44.863 region:rollup2

MUCH MORE EXPOSURE RIGHT. AND

02:26:51.136 --> 02:26:53.538 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER THING TO THINK

02:26:51.736 --> 02:26:55.740 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS LIKE IN IN TERMS OF A

02:26:53.538 --> 02:26:56.975 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FORUM.

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:58.376 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT

02:26:56.975 --> 02:26:59.878 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW LIKE FACEBOOK FOR

EXAMPLE IS MUCH MORE OF A PUBLIC

02:26:59.878 --> 02:27:02.514 region:rollup2
FORUM.

02:27:01.246 --> 02:27:04.182 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THEN THE STEPS OF THE

02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:06.618 region:rollup2
CAPITOL RIGHT. THE PEOPLE HAVE

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:07.185 region:rollup2
RALLIES HERE ALL THE TIME BUT

02:27:06.618 --> 02:27:08.319 region:rollup2
YOU PROBABLY SEE A LOT MORE

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:10.622 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:12.691 region:rollup2
IDEAS BEING EXPRESSED AND THINK

02:27:10.622 --> 02:27:14.292 region:rollup2
COMING BACK AND FORTH MORE SO IN

02:27:12.691 --> 02:27:15.694 region:rollup2
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD AND

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:17.262 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING WHAT PEOPLE THINK

02:27:15.694 --> 02:27:19.531 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:27:17.262 --> 02:27:21.366 region:rollup2
POLITICS AND ISSUES MUCH MORE SO

02:27:19.531 --> 02:27:22.634 region:rollup2

BE INTERPRETED AS FREE SPEECH

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:54.085 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGICAL. DEVELOPMENT.

02:38:15.219 --> 02:38:17.855 region:rollup2
BLOCKING TECHNOLOGY IS IT IS IN

02:38:16.354 --> 02:38:19.557 region:rollup2
ITS INFANCY.

02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:22.093 region:rollup2

ITSELF.

02:38:23.995 --> 02:38:27.231 region:rollup2
AS WITH WEB TECHNOLOGY

02:38:25.062 --> 02:38:29.033 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS OF THE FOUR MOST

02:38:27.231 --> 02:38:30.534 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION.

02:38:29.033 --> 02:38:31.502 region:rollup2
WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE

INNOVATION PROCEEDS

02:38:36.707 --> 02:38:42.713 region:rollup2
AT ARE EVER INCREASING US BEAT.

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:44.482 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION EXPANDING YOU ETS

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:45.816 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OFF THAT TRACK RECORD

02:38:44.482 --> 02:38:47.752 region:rollup2

INCLUDE AND RECORD OUR SIGNATURE

02:38:47.752 --> 02:38:50.187 region:rollup2
THAT IS SECURE THROUGH THE

02:38:48.319 --> 02:38:51.222 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. THE NO

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:53.090 region:rollup2
BRAINER.

02:38:51.222 --> 02:38:54.658 region:rollup2
WIFE BECAUSE BLOCKCHAIN IS

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:56.894 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY IMMUTABLE AND

02:38:54.658 --> 02:38:58.763 region:rollup2
AUDITABLE.

02:38:56.894 --> 02:39:00.097 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS ONCE A WRECK IT

02:38:58.763 --> 02:39:01.999 region:rollup2
IS WRITTEN TO A BLOCKCHAIN. IT

02:39:00.097 --> 02:39:03.534 region:rollup2
IS THEREFORE EVER.

02:39:01.999 --> 02:39:04.969 region:rollup2
IT CANNOT BE ALTERED AND IT IS

02:39:03.534 --> 02:39:07.104 region:rollup2
VISIBLE TO ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO

02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:08.305 region:rollup2
THE CHASE.

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:10.574 region:rollup2
A BLOCKCHAIN IS A DATABASE THAT

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:12.076 region:rollup2
GOD BE HACKED.

02:39:10.574 --> 02:39:14.845 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE SECURITY IS BAKED

02:39:12.076 --> 02:39:15.513 region:rollup2
INTO THE CRYPTOGRAPHY.

02:39:14.845 --> 02:39:18.382 region:rollup2
WHEN I SIGNED THE RECORD WITH MY

02:39:15.513 --> 02:39:18.916 region:rollup2
PUBLIC KEY IT IS UNALTERABLY

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.151 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTE IT TO ME ON THE

02:39:18.916 --> 02:39:21.352 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN.

02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:23.988 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE A CRYPTOGRAPHY

02:39:21.352 --> 02:39:26.290 region:rollup2
KEY IS ACTUALLY A PAIR OF KEYS.

02:39:23.988 --> 02:39:27.358 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC KEY SEEN BY EVERYONE

02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:28.926 region:rollup2
GIANT MATHEMATICALLY TO A

02:39:27.358 --> 02:39:31.228 region:rollup2
PRIVATE KEY.

02:39:28.926 --> 02:39:32.596 region:rollup2
SEEN ONLY BY ME.

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:34.198 region:rollup2
SO I BAD ACTOR CANNOT HACKETT

02:39:32.596 --> 02:39:35.299 region:rollup2
DATABASES TO MY PASTOR BECAUSE

02:39:34.198 --> 02:39:37.234 region:rollup2
MY PRIVATE KEY NEVER LEAVES MY

02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:39.737 region:rollup2
COMPUTER.

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:41.772 region:rollup2
HOWEVER. I SUGGEST CAUTION

02:39:39.737 --> 02:39:44.175 region:rollup2
REGARDING SMALL CONTRACTS.

02:39:41.772 --> 02:39:45.209 region:rollup2
WRITTEN CONTRACTS ARE ALL OFTEN

02:39:44.175 --> 02:39:46.610 region:rollup2
ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BUT

02:39:45.209 --> 02:39:48.279 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:49.780 region:rollup2
BERKELEY ASSEMBLY THEORETICALLY

02:39:48.279 --> 02:39:50.681 region:rollup2
HUMAN READABLE.

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:52.083 region:rollup2
SMART CONTRACTS ON THE OTHER

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:54.819 region:rollup2
HAND.

02:39:52.083 --> 02:39:55.352 region:rollup2
ARE WRITTEN IN COMPUTER CODE.

02:39:54.819 --> 02:39:56.587 region:rollup2
AS A PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:58.355 region:rollup2
ENGINEER.

02:39:56.587 --> 02:40:00.091 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

02:39:58.355 --> 02:40:01.926 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE.

02:40:00.091 --> 02:40:03.394 region:rollup2
TO SAY NOTHING OFTEN. ABILITY TO

02:40:01.926 --> 02:40:05.095 region:rollup2
DO SO.

02:40:03.394 --> 02:40:06.664 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE COURT OFTEN HAS

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:08.265 region:rollup2
BUGS WHICH CAUSED UNINTENDED

02:40:06.664 --> 02:40:09.834 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:11.602 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT THERE'S A GREATER

02:40:09.834 --> 02:40:13.270 region:rollup2
RISK FOR IT OFFICE PERSON

02:40:11.602 --> 02:40:14.939 region:rollup2
COMMITTING TO ESPOT CONTRACT

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:16.207 region:rollup2
THAT HAS PROVISIONS THAT THERE

02:40:14.939 --> 02:40:17.808 region:rollup2
ARE EVEN THE CONTRACT WE SURE DO

02:40:16.207 --> 02:40:19.310 region:rollup2
NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND.

02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:21.112 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION LEGISLATION

02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:21.612 region:rollup2
REGARDS WHAT CONTRACTS MUST.

02:40:21.112 --> 02:40:22.746 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THESE IMPORTANT

02:40:21.612 --> 02:40:24.048 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS

02:40:22.746 --> 02:40:25.616 region:rollup2
SO I SUPPORT THE AMENDMENTS TO

02:40:24.048 --> 02:40:27.184 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

02:40:25.616 --> 02:40:28.185 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

02:40:27.184 --> 02:40:29.787 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I

02:46:06.457 --> 02:46:09.193 region:rollup2
PROVIDE GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY

02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:10.694 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE BILL AS IT'S

02:46:09.193 --> 02:46:12.095 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:14.631 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY.

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:15.432 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT IT DOES NOT DO

02:46:14.631 --> 02:46:17.301 region:rollup2
THAT FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:19.470 region:rollup2
REASONS AS THE ANALYSIS POINTED

02:46:17.301 --> 02:46:21.038 region:rollup2
OUT THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A AND

02:46:19.470 --> 02:46:22.606 region:rollup2
A UNIFORM ESTABLISHED.

02:46:21.038 --> 02:46:24.274 region:rollup2
STANDARD FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES

02:46:22.606 --> 02:46:25.843 region:rollup2
PLOTTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE SIX

02:46:24.274 --> 02:46:28.011 region:rollup2
OR SEVEN BILLS. THAT OTHER

02:46:25.843 --> 02:46:29.413 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE HAVE STARTED DOWN

02:46:28.011 --> 02:46:30.714 region:rollup2
THIS ROAD THEY USE DIFFERENT

02:46:29.413 --> 02:46:32.649 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGIES THE UNIFORM LAW

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:33.784 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS NOT. ENGAGE IN

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:35.619 region:rollup2
THIS EFFORT.

02:46:33.784 --> 02:46:36.987 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

02:46:35.619 --> 02:46:37.621 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH.

02:46:36.987 --> 02:46:40.157 region:rollup2
TO.

02:46:37.621 --> 02:46:41.658 region:rollup2
TO DEFINE THE TECHNOLOGY SO

02:46:40.157 --> 02:46:43.727 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS ONE OF OUR CONCERNS

02:46:41.658 --> 02:46:44.127 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IS THAT. IN VERMONT IN

02:46:43.727 --> 02:46:45.362 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WHERE.

02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:47.598 region:rollup2
.

02:46:45.362 --> 02:46:49.733 region:rollup2
WHERE ELISE THAT FORMED THE

02:46:47.598 --> 02:46:50.901 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR THE IDEA BEHIND THE

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:52.469 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT? THE

02:46:50.901 --> 02:46:53.737 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED THERE

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:55.739 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING ABOUT A TWO YEAR.

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:57.040 region:rollup2
UNSTEADY WE'D WE DON'T HAVE THAT

02:46:55.739 --> 02:47:00.177 region:rollup2
HERE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.478 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHEN YOU JUST LOOK UP

02:47:00.177 --> 02:47:02.779 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AROUND BLOCKCHAIN. YOU

02:47:01.478 --> 02:47:04.014 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:04.982 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS OF COURSE OF THE

02:47:04.014 --> 02:47:06.283 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND THERE ARE A

02:47:04.982 --> 02:47:07.918 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CONCERNS INCLUDING

02:47:06.283 --> 02:47:09.653 region:rollup2
PRIVACY CONCERNS.

02:47:07.918 --> 02:47:11.588 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE IMMUTABLE NATURE.

02:47:09.653 --> 02:47:12.789 region:rollup2
OF IT I'M.

02:47:11.588 --> 02:47:14.358 region:rollup2
MY COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED THE

02:47:12.789 --> 02:47:15.893 region:rollup2
BILL IS MADE UP OF COMPLEX

02:47:14.358 --> 02:47:17.127 region:rollup2
LITIGATION JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS

02:47:15.893 --> 02:47:18.362 region:rollup2
VERY SOPHISTICATED THESE ARE NOT

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:19.363 region:rollup2
LET AYE IT'S.

02:47:18.362 --> 02:47:21.565 region:rollup2
AND THEY LOOK AT THE CURRENT

02:47:19.363 --> 02:47:22.065 region:rollup2
DEFINITION AND DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:47:21.565 --> 02:47:23.200 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:24.701 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THAT.

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:26.003 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK A

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:27.037 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:47:26.003 --> 02:47:29.339 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE.

02:47:27.037 --> 02:47:31.341 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION TO TO TO MEET

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:32.442 region:rollup2
THE GOAL. AND THE OTHER THING

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:33.477 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED

02:47:32.442 --> 02:47:35.779 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THAT WE'VE NOT HEARD

02:47:33.477 --> 02:47:37.714 region:rollup2
YET ANY REAL WORLD EXAMPLES OF

02:47:35.779 --> 02:47:39.883 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFORNIA A CASE.

02:47:37.714 --> 02:47:41.785 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NOT ABLE TO BE BROADER

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:43.287 region:rollup2
HAD SOME CONFUSION IN TERMS OF

02:47:41.785 --> 02:47:45.088 region:rollup2
HOW WAS LITIGATED BECAUSE OF THE

02:47:43.287 --> 02:47:46.623 region:rollup2
LACK. OF A DEFINITION OF WHAT

02:47:45.088 --> 02:47:48.125 region:rollup2
TRAIN TECHNOLOGY IF WE CAN GET A

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:49.927 region:rollup2
BETTER SENSE.

02:47:48.125 --> 02:47:51.862 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THEIR REAL CONCERN IS IN

02:47:49.927 --> 02:47:54.031 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL WORLD.

02:47:51.862 --> 02:47:55.933 region:rollup2
A ABOUT THAT. ABOUT THE NEED

02:47:54.031 --> 02:47:57.234 region:rollup2
THEN PERHAPS WE COULD HELP WITH

02:47:55.933 --> 02:47:58.468 region:rollup2
WHERE IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE

02:47:57.234 --> 02:48:00.304 region:rollup2
CODES HOW TO BETTER DEFINE IT.

02:47:58.468 --> 02:48:00.804 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THE CERTAINTY THAT

02:48:00.304 --> 02:48:01.872 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW THAT YEAR.

02:48:00.804 --> 02:48:04.041 region:rollup2
.

02:48:01.872 --> 02:48:05.242 region:rollup2
SEEKING THE FINAL THING THAT M.

02:48:04.041 --> 02:48:07.511 region:rollup2
THAT MY FOLKS WANTED TO BRING

02:48:05.242 --> 02:48:08.645 region:rollup2
OUT IS THAT THAT WE KNOW THIS IS

02:48:07.511 --> 02:48:10.147 region:rollup2
AN EMERGING IN REALLY IMPORTANT

02:48:08.645 --> 02:48:11.081 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GETTING A LOT

02:48:10.147 --> 02:48:12.482 region:rollup2
OF ATTENTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER

02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:12.983 region:rollup2
NEW TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:13.750 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TOLD ME I SHOULD

02:48:12.983 --> 02:48:14.585 region:rollup2
MENTION.

02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:15.786 region:rollup2
CUBIT

02:48:14.585 --> 02:48:17.688 region:rollup2
WHICH I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW

02:48:15.786 --> 02:48:20.057 region:rollup2
EVEN WHAT IT MEANS BUT I'M TOLD

02:48:17.688 --> 02:48:22.025 region:rollup2
THAT IT COULD REPLACE OR BE A

02:48:20.057 --> 02:48:23.727 region:rollup2
NEW AND DIFFERENT. WAY OF

02:48:22.025 --> 02:48:25.529 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING YOU KNOW THESE KINDS

02:48:23.727 --> 02:48:27.597 region:rollup2
OF TRANSACTIONS ARE WE GOING TO

02:48:25.529 --> 02:48:28.131 region:rollup2
UPDATE OUR CODES. EVERYTIME

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:29.700 region:rollup2
THERE IS ONE OF THESE NEW

02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:31.201 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES SO FOR ALL THOSE

02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:33.036 region:rollup2
REASONS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS BUT

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:34.304 region:rollup2
WE LOOK FORWARD. TO TO WORKING

02:48:33.036 --> 02:48:35.839 region:rollup2
WITH THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF YOUR

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:37.174 region:rollup2
POLICY COMMITTEE STAFF AND

02:48:35.839 --> 02:48:39.242 region:rollup2
OTHERS AS THE BILL MOVES. THANK

02:48:37.174 --> 02:48:41.078 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OF IF I

02:48:39.242 --> 02:48:42.212 region:rollup2
JUST TO MAKE SURE OF IS THAT OUR

02:48:41.078 --> 02:48:43.580 region:rollup2
FI I RESPECT THE POSITION.

02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:44.247 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL I ABSOLUTELY

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:45.749 region:rollup2
AM GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:47.217 region:rollup2
THEM I MEAN APART THE PROBLEM IS

02:48:45.749 --> 02:48:47.784 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT

02:48:47.217 --> 02:48:49.152 region:rollup2
OF LANGUAGE OUT THERE WITH

02:48:47.784 --> 02:48:50.721 region:rollup2
REGARDS THIS TECHNOLOGY WE'RE

02:48:49.152 --> 02:48:52.255 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO WAS. AS HONE IN ON

02:48:50.721 --> 02:48:53.290 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO WAS ALSO

02:48:52.255 --> 02:48:54.825 region:rollup2
CREATED A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN

02:48:53.290 --> 02:48:56.560 region:rollup2
UNABLE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO AT

02:48:54.825 --> 02:48:58.028 region:rollup2
LEAST YOU KNOW BE. BE WORKED ON

02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:58.929 region:rollup2
HERE CREATED HERE AND CREATE THE

02:48:58.028 --> 02:49:00.697 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A

02:48:58.929 --> 02:49:01.765 region:rollup2
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN

02:49:00.697 --> 02:49:03.033 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE APPARENTLY

02:49:01.765 --> 02:49:04.434 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EXIST ONE THERE THERE'S

02:49:03.033 --> 02:49:06.036 region:rollup2
NOT ONE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:06.837 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HERE IN

02:49:06.036 --> 02:49:08.071 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO SET A

02:49:06.837 --> 02:49:09.573 region:rollup2
STANDARD. I'M NOT JUST

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:10.340 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY BUT WORLDWIDE BECAUSE

02:49:09.573 --> 02:49:11.041 region:rollup2
THERE REALLY IS NO FRAMEWORK

02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:12.509 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE

02:49:11.041 --> 02:49:14.011 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND THE REASON WHY

02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:15.712 region:rollup2
WE ARE FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE

02:49:14.011 --> 02:49:17.447 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CHARACTER

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:18.582 region:rollup2
CURRENCY AS AS A BIT BIT POINT.

02:49:17.447 --> 02:49:20.350 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL

02:49:18.582 --> 02:49:21.785 region:rollup2
MARKET WHERE A LOT OF DOLLARS

02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:23.253 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

02:49:21.785 --> 02:49:24.021 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY AND A

02:49:23.253 --> 02:49:25.756 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION IS

02:49:24.021 --> 02:49:27.791 region:rollup2
BEING PLACE TO IT AND SO. YOU

02:49:25.756 --> 02:49:29.726 region:rollup2
KNOW IF THE IF YOU KNOW IF IF WE

02:49:27.791 --> 02:49:31.695 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE THIS

02:49:29.726 --> 02:49:33.964 region:rollup2
INNOVATION HA BAY INNOVATION HUB

02:49:31.695 --> 02:49:35.465 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO START COMING UP WITH

02:49:33.964 --> 02:49:37.300 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ABOUT

02:49:35.465 --> 02:49:38.969 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITIONS ARE KIND OF THE

02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.469 region:rollup2
START OF THAT SO I LOOK FORWARD

02:49:38.969 --> 02:49:40.404 region:rollup2
TO WORKING WITH JUDICIAL

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:41.805 region:rollup2
COUNCIL.

02:49:40.404 --> 02:49:43.240 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE NEXT COMMITTEE

02:49:41.805 --> 02:49:44.675 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:45.642 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO HELP US KIND OF HONE IN

02:49:44.675 --> 02:49:46.710 region:rollup2
ON THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:48.211 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:49.379 region:rollup2
TO GET BACK IS AGAIN THAT

02:49:48.211 --> 02:49:51.515 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE

02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:53.283 region:rollup2
FOR US TO LOOK TO TRY TO DEFINE

02:49:51.515 --> 02:49:54.484 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT IS IT'S WHAT WE YOU

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:56.353 region:rollup2
KNOW WE ARE CREATING AN.

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:59.956 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:49:56.353 --> 02:50:01.224 region:rollup2

OPPOSITION OR NEUTRAL.

02:50:01.224 --> 02:50:02.626 region:rollup2
YES I HAD.

02:50:01.525 --> 02:50:03.226 region:rollup2
HIGH ON MY NAME IS ANDREW

CLINTON.

02:50:03.226 --> 02:50:05.562 region:rollup2
I REPRESENT A BLOCKCHAIN AT

02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:06.063 region:rollup2
BERKELEY LAW. I AM THE HEAD OF

02:50:05.562 --> 02:50:06.763 region:rollup2
LEGAL RESEARCH THERE.

02:50:06.063 --> 02:50:08.198 region:rollup2
I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF.

02:50:06.763 --> 02:50:09.132 region:rollup2
AN INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP.

02:50:08.198 --> 02:50:11.101 region:rollup2
ON.

02:50:09.132 --> 02:50:12.135 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE LEISURE TECHNOLOGY

02:50:11.101 --> 02:50:13.003 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOWN AS BITCOIN PARA

BLOCKCHAIN.

02:50:13.003 --> 02:50:16.106 region:rollup2
.

02:50:15.605 --> 02:50:18.775 region:rollup2
AND.

02:50:16.106 --> 02:50:20.644 region:rollup2
I I'M RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT I

02:50:18.775 --> 02:50:21.344 region:rollup2
OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE I

02:50:20.644 --> 02:50:22.979 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

02:50:21.344 --> 02:50:24.681 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

02:50:22.979 --> 02:50:27.250 region:rollup2
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

02:50:24.681 --> 02:50:30.754 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IN UP PROMOTING.

02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:32.255 region:rollup2
LEGAL AND REGULATORY CERTAINTY.

02:50:30.754 --> 02:50:35.892 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THIS TECHNOLOGY.

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:37.360 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF FAIRLY

02:50:35.892 --> 02:50:38.962 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:41.798 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF THE BILL.

02:50:38.962 --> 02:50:41.965 region:rollup2
AM FIRST AND FOREMOST A LOT OF

02:50:41.798 --> 02:50:44.668 region:rollup2
THE.

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:47.537 region:rollup2
LEGAL CHALLENGES.

02:50:44.668 --> 02:50:49.573 region:rollup2
THAT DIGITAL ASSETS FACE.

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:49.973 region:rollup2
ARE NOT PRIMARILY AT THE STATE

02:50:49.573 --> 02:50:53.410 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:54.244 region:rollup2
THEY THERE ARE CERTAINLY SO IT

02:50:53.410 --> 02:50:56.580 region:rollup2
IS KIND OF A MYTH THAT.

02:50:54.244 --> 02:50:57.914 region:rollup2
DECLINE IS UNREGULATED IT IT IS

02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:59.850 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REGULATED.

02:50:57.914 --> 02:51:01.585 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY UNDER MONEY

02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:03.186 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION STATUTES.

02:51:01.585 --> 02:51:04.054 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF FINS

02:51:03.186 --> 02:51:06.289 region:rollup2
AND.

02:51:04.054 --> 02:51:10.026 region:rollup2
AND UNDER THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

02:51:06.289 --> 02:51:12.763 region:rollup2
.

02:51:10.026 --> 02:51:14.865 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THAT HAS RESULTED IN THE

02:51:12.763 --> 02:51:17.634 region:rollup2
REGULATORY REGIME ARE BEING VERY

02:51:14.865 --> 02:51:18.969 region:rollup2
FRACTURED THE PATCHWORK OF STATE

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:21.738 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL REGULATION.

02:51:18.969 --> 02:51:23.907 region:rollup2
INVOLVING FENCE AND THE CFTC

02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:26.443 region:rollup2
THE SEC THE IRA S..

02:51:23.907 --> 02:51:29.212 region:rollup2
AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES

02:51:26.443 --> 02:51:30.547 region:rollup2
AND SO. ARE THE BASIC CONCERN IS

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:32.549 region:rollup2
THEY THE YOUNG THE LEGAL

02:51:30.547 --> 02:51:33.783 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY THAT EXISTS IS

02:51:32.549 --> 02:51:35.752 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:51:33.783 --> 02:51:36.319 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK THERE ARE THINGS AT

02:51:35.752 --> 02:51:37.187 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL THAT CAN BE

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:39.489 region:rollup2
DONE.

02:51:37.187 --> 02:51:42.025 region:rollup2
BUT HONESTLY DEFINING A

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:43.693 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN IS NOT REALLY THAT

02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:46.163 region:rollup2
THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE.

02:51:43.693 --> 02:51:47.264 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRONIC RECORDS ACT AS

02:51:46.163 --> 02:51:49.099 region:rollup2
IT CURRENTLY ALREADY EXISTS.

02:51:47.264 --> 02:51:51.568 region:rollup2
.

02:51:49.099 --> 02:51:53.303 region:rollup2
IS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS

02:51:51.568 --> 02:51:55.005 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.

02:51:53.303 --> 02:51:56.239 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT THE

02:51:55.005 --> 02:51:57.240 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IS VERY.

02:51:56.239 --> 02:51:58.675 region:rollup2
CONCERNING TO ME.

02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:00.443 region:rollup2
.

02:51:58.675 --> 02:52:02.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT USES TERMINOLOGY LIKE

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:04.114 region:rollup2
A A DECENTRALIZED SHARED AND

02:52:02.612 --> 02:52:07.450 region:rollup2
RECIPROCAL LEDGER.

02:52:04.114 --> 02:52:09.653 region:rollup2
WELL DECENTRALIZATION CAN IS A

02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:10.954 region:rollup2
PARAMETER THAT IS EXIST ON A

02:52:09.653 --> 02:52:12.489 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM ITS NOT A BINARY IT'S

02:52:10.954 --> 02:52:13.156 region:rollup2
NOT IT IS DECENTRALIZED OR IT'S

02:52:12.489 --> 02:52:14.691 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:52:13.156 --> 02:52:16.760 region:rollup2
.

02:52:14.691 --> 02:52:18.161 region:rollup2
IT IS.

02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:19.696 region:rollup2
IF THINGS CAN BE MORE OR LESS

02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:21.865 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED ON A NUMBER OF

02:52:19.696 --> 02:52:22.599 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS.

02:52:21.865 --> 02:52:25.435 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY.

02:52:22.599 --> 02:52:27.470 region:rollup2
I AM NOT QUITE CLEAR ON WHAT A

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:30.207 region:rollup2
RECIPROCAL LEDGER MEANS.

02:52:27.470 --> 02:52:32.642 region:rollup2
.

02:52:30.207 --> 02:52:33.977 region:rollup2
THE BILL SAYS THAT A BOXING IS

02:52:32.642 --> 02:52:34.811 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY TALKING I SCRIPT OF

02:52:33.977 --> 02:52:36.646 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS.

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:37.214 region:rollup2
THE TERM CRYPTO ECONOMICS IS

02:52:36.646 --> 02:52:40.483 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS EVER

02:52:37.214 --> 02:52:41.852 region:rollup2
BEEN.

02:52:40.483 --> 02:52:42.652 region:rollup2
HOUSTON AS STATUTE I'M NOT SURE

02:52:41.852 --> 02:52:44.020 region:rollup2
ANYONE KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS TO

02:52:42.652 --> 02:52:46.056 region:rollup2
BE HONEST.

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.856 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY IN THE IN THE

02:52:46.056 --> 02:52:47.958 region:rollup2
SECOND SENTENCE ARE DESCRIBING

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:49.826 region:rollup2
BLOCKING TECHNOLOGY.

02:52:47.958 --> 02:52:51.428 region:rollup2
IT SAYS THE DATA ON THE LEDGER

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:53.730 region:rollup2
IS PROTECTED WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY.

02:52:51.428 --> 02:52:55.298 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT.

02:52:53.730 --> 02:52:58.034 region:rollup2
IS IMMUTABLE.

02:52:55.298 --> 02:53:00.370 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY.

02:52:58.034 --> 02:53:01.938 region:rollup2
IS AUDITABLE IT MAY NOT BE

02:53:00.370 --> 02:53:03.306 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A PROTOCOL SUCH AS HE

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:04.641 region:rollup2
CASH IN THE NARROW WHICH OUR

02:53:03.306 --> 02:53:05.742 region:rollup2
PRIVACY PRESERVING.

02:53:04.641 --> 02:53:07.110 region:rollup2
AND WHICH ARE NOT IN FACT

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:08.645 region:rollup2
AUDITABLE.

02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:10.747 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDES AN UNCENSORED

02:53:08.645 --> 02:53:12.782 region:rollup2
TRUTH AND I THINK THAT IT CAN BE

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:13.850 region:rollup2
VERY MISLEADING BECAUSE A

02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:15.652 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN CAN RECORD.

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:17.354 region:rollup2
.

02:53:15.652 --> 02:53:19.356 region:rollup2
CAN RECORD THAT A STATEMENT OR

02:53:17.354 --> 02:53:20.657 region:rollup2
TRANSACTION WAS MADE BUT NOT THE

02:53:19.356 --> 02:53:23.126 region:rollup2
TRUTH NOT THE UNDERLYING TRUTH

02:53:20.657 --> 02:53:25.295 region:rollup2
OF THAT. SO I CAN SAY THE SKY IS

02:53:23.126 --> 02:53:27.964 region:rollup2
PURPLE AND A BLOCKING CAN RECORD

02:53:25.295 --> 02:53:29.266 region:rollup2
THAT IN ALMOST PERPETUITY. THAT

02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:31.034 region:rollup2
I SAID THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY WOULD

02:53:29.266 --> 02:53:32.602 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:53:31.034 --> 02:53:34.571 region:rollup2
IN FACT MAKE THE SKY PURPLE.

02:53:32.602 --> 02:53:36.573 region:rollup2
.

02:53:34.571 --> 02:53:37.874 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS.

02:53:36.573 --> 02:53:40.010 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

02:53:37.874 --> 02:53:42.245 region:rollup2
.

02:53:40.010 --> 02:53:43.513 region:rollup2
AND I A I HEARD THAT THE BIT

02:53:42.245 --> 02:53:45.916 region:rollup2
ABOUT SMART CONTRACTS.

02:53:43.513 --> 02:53:46.583 region:rollup2
WAS WAS STRUCK SO I I GUESS I

02:53:45.916 --> 02:53:47.317 region:rollup2
WANT.

02:53:46.583 --> 02:53:49.786 region:rollup2
COME INTO THAT.

02:53:47.317 --> 02:53:50.520 region:rollup2
BUT I DO HAVE ALTERNATIVE

02:53:49.786 --> 02:53:53.823 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:55.458 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD BE ADOPTED.

02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:59.863 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:53:55.458 --> 02:54:00.997 region:rollup2
I AM ABLE TO IDENTIFY ABOUT A

02:53:59.863 --> 02:54:03.033 region:rollup2
HALF DOZEN.

02:54:00.997 --> 02:54:05.368 region:rollup2
AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THAT

02:54:03.033 --> 02:54:05.769 region:rollup2
COULD BE AMENDED THAT WOULD

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:08.004 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROVIDE.

02:54:05.769 --> 02:54:09.806 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CLARITY AND

02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:11.708 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:14.010 region:rollup2
FOR THE INDUSTRY ON WHICH I'M

02:54:11.708 --> 02:54:14.544 region:rollup2
HAPPY GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON ALL

02:54:14.010 --> 02:54:16.579 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:17.881 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE COMMITTEE WISH.

02:54:16.579 --> 02:54:20.317 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO INVITE

BILLS ARE HURT THE BILL AND.

02:54:28.792 --> 02:54:32.495 region:rollup2
MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO MOVE A

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:33.830 region:rollup2
FORCE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

BRING THE BILL FORWARD I'M

02:55:47.704 --> 02:55:51.641 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY JEALOUS THAT I DIDN'T

02:55:49.072 --> 02:55:54.310 region:rollup2
THINK OF IT FIRST.

02:55:51.641 --> 02:55:56.479 region:rollup2
BOB I TOGETHER.

02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:58.948 region:rollup2
WHAT SURE PEPPY CO AUTHOR FEEL

02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:59.582 region:rollup2
I'D? LIKE ARCHITECT I'M AUTHORS

02:55:58.948 --> 02:56:00.583 region:rollup2
DONE.

02:55:59.582 --> 02:56:01.618 region:rollup2
I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF BEEN

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:03.219 region:rollup2
RAISED ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF

02:56:01.618 --> 02:56:04.988 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY RELIES

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:06.523 region:rollup2
APOLOGIST TOOK THE DEFINITION OF

02:56:04.988 --> 02:56:07.791 region:rollup2
THE ARIZONA BILL. A BUT I THINK

02:56:06.523 --> 02:56:09.125 region:rollup2
IT DOES NEED SOME REFINEMENT

02:56:07.791 --> 02:56:10.460 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN THE TECHNICAL

02:56:09.125 --> 02:56:11.795 region:rollup2
ASPECTS TO MAKE IT MAKE SURE

02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:13.463 region:rollup2
THAT WERE BEING VERY SPECIFIC

02:56:11.795 --> 02:56:15.231 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN. WHEN WE SAY

02:56:13.463 --> 02:56:16.599 region:rollup2
BLOCKCHAIN BUT I WITH THAT COPY

02:56:15.231 --> 02:56:18.435 region:rollup2

DEVELOP A BETTER PROGRAM OR A

02:56:25.008 --> 02:56:29.579 region:rollup2
BETTER DEFINITION WHEN IT COMES

02:56:27.010 --> 02:56:30.213 region:rollup2
TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:52.295 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO THEY COULD BUILD ON

03:02:50.726 --> 03:02:53.830 region:rollup2
WHAT'S OUT THERE ALREADY BUT

03:02:52.295 --> 03:02:55.731 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS YOU KNOW AN

03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:56.199 region:rollup2
AREA THAT WE WANT TO CUT IT.

03:02:55.731 --> 03:02:58.234 region:rollup2
KINDA UNTIL NEW LAUNCH

03:02:56.199 --> 03:02:59.068 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

03:02:58.234 --> 03:03:00.436 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS TO ME OF THAT GOAL

03:02:59.068 --> 03:03:02.071 region:rollup2
IS TO DO NEW RESEARCH MAYBE

03:03:00.436 --> 03:03:02.505 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THE BEST AND THE DEED

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:03.806 region:rollup2
TO BE.

03:03:02.505 --> 03:03:06.375 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

03:03:03.806 --> 03:03:07.643 region:rollup2
MAKING THAT HAPPENED I I MEAN

03:03:06.375 --> 03:03:08.744 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT SOME OF

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:09.812 region:rollup2
THE SITUATIONS YOU MAKE IT SEEM

03:03:08.744 --> 03:03:12.215 region:rollup2
LIKE THERE'S BEEN WORK DONE

03:03:09.812 --> 03:03:13.249 region:rollup2
ALREADY SO. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

03:03:12.215 --> 03:03:14.984 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO THAT

03:03:13.249 --> 03:03:16.385 region:rollup2
WHATEVER PROFESSORS AT VARIOUS

03:03:14.984 --> 03:03:17.186 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD

03:03:16.385 --> 03:03:18.554 region:rollup2
ARE DOING ON THIS IF WE COULD

03:03:17.186 --> 03:03:20.022 region:rollup2
AGGREGATE WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND

03:03:18.554 --> 03:03:21.023 region:rollup2
THEN SORT OF MAKE IT USEFUL FOR

03:03:20.022 --> 03:03:22.325 region:rollup2
US THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DATE

03:03:21.023 --> 03:03:24.060 region:rollup2
FUNCTION? NOW I'M GONNA ASK MY

03:03:22.325 --> 03:03:25.995 region:rollup2
NGUYEN IS TO ADD TO THAT AGAIN

03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:27.897 region:rollup2
THIS COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION

03:03:25.995 --> 03:03:30.233 region:rollup2
HAS DONE A. QUITE A LOT OF

03:03:27.897 --> 03:03:31.834 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND PULLED ON RESEARCH

03:03:30.233 --> 03:03:33.936 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING. THIS

03:03:31.834 --> 03:03:36.239 region:rollup2
THIS RESEARCH HAS ONLY RECENTLY

03:03:33.936 --> 03:03:37.807 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE SO WHAT WE NEED TO BE

03:03:36.239 --> 03:03:39.308 region:rollup2
DOING WHAT WE FEEL THAT THE BILL

03:03:37.807 --> 03:03:41.811 region:rollup2
WOULD DO IS TO LOOK AT CURRENT

03:03:39.308 --> 03:03:43.412 region:rollup2
RESEARCH EXPAND UPON NOT. AND

03:03:41.811 --> 03:03:44.981 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT LONGITUDINAL DATA

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:47.717 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T JUST RELY ON DATA

03:03:44.981 --> 03:03:48.384 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE.

03:03:47.717 --> 03:03:49.952 region:rollup2
SO SHE IS TECHNOLOGY IS

03:03:48.384 --> 03:03:51.921 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING KIDS ARE USING

03:03:49.952 --> 03:03:53.222 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY

03:03:51.921 --> 03:03:55.424 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE OF IT.

03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:56.893 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN NOT LONGITUDINAL DATA

03:03:55.424 --> 03:03:58.494 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

03:03:56.893 --> 03:04:00.696 region:rollup2
GET OUT.

03:03:58.494 --> 03:04:03.499 region:rollup2
YEAH.

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:06.502 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR.

03:04:03.499 --> 03:04:07.770 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE A. MISTER CHOW I'M

03:04:06.502 --> 03:04:10.139 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:11.874 region:rollup2
A AND I AM. VERY THANKFUL THAT

03:04:10.139 --> 03:04:13.576 region:rollup2
IN THE PREAMBLE YOU POINTED OUT

03:04:11.874 --> 03:04:15.444 region:rollup2
THAT THE PURPOSE THE REPORT IS

03:04:13.576 --> 03:04:16.612 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS BOTH. NEGATIVE AND

03:04:15.444 --> 03:04:18.147 region:rollup2
POSITIVE OUTCOMES

03:04:16.612 --> 03:04:21.017 region:rollup2
EXOTIC IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE

03:04:18.147 --> 03:04:22.551 region:rollup2
UNBIASED AND NOT SEEK A A

03:04:21.017 --> 03:04:23.052 region:rollup2
PREDETERMINED CONCLUSION WHEN WE

03:04:22.551 --> 03:04:24.086 region:rollup2
ADDRESS REPORT LIKE THIS

03:04:23.052 --> 03:04:27.023 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

03:04:24.086 --> 03:04:28.157 region:rollup2
IT IN THAT VEIN I WOULD ASK THAT

03:04:27.023 --> 03:04:30.226 region:rollup2
YOU CONSIDER PUTTING IN SOME

03:04:28.157 --> 03:04:31.794 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TOPICS TO RESEARCH

03:04:30.226 --> 03:04:32.862 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF

03:04:31.794 --> 03:04:34.263 region:rollup2
THINGS WE'RE LOOKING INTO.

03:04:32.862 --> 03:04:35.431 region:rollup2
PARKED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IN

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:36.566 region:rollup2
A SENSE NEGATIVE HEALTH

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:37.833 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES

03:04:36.566 --> 03:04:38.568 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:39.735 region:rollup2
SINCE WE'RE IN FOR BEING

03:04:38.568 --> 03:04:41.504 region:rollup2
UNBIASED WE ALSO NEED TO WEIGH

03:04:39.735 --> 03:04:42.838 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE. OF THE EFFECT OF

03:04:41.504 --> 03:04:44.941 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH DIGITAL DEVICES

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:47.276 region:rollup2
AS CHILDREN ON LIFETIME EARNINGS

03:04:44.941 --> 03:04:49.245 region:rollup2
ON PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS SO THAT

03:04:47.276 --> 03:04:50.947 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN REALLY MAKE. AN

03:04:49.245 --> 03:04:52.815 region:rollup2
INFORMED DECISION ABOUT BOTH THE

03:04:50.947 --> 03:04:55.184 region:rollup2
DANGERS AND THE ASSETS OF THAT

03:04:52.815 --> 03:04:56.285 region:rollup2
TYPE OF INTERSECTION AS A CHILD.

03:04:55.184 --> 03:04:57.353 region:rollup2
YES ACTUALLY THANKS FOR THE

03:04:56.285 --> 03:04:58.287 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION IN FACT OF THE

03:04:57.353 --> 03:04:59.755 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT

03:04:58.287 --> 03:05:01.257 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN STUDY BOTH THE

03:04:59.755 --> 03:05:02.358 region:rollup2
POSITIVE NEGATIVE ROSE. ALL

03:05:01.257 --> 03:05:04.460 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE SECTION SIX AYE

03:05:02.358 --> 03:05:06.529 region:rollup2
VOTE FOR TO A FOUR ZERO POINT

03:05:04.460 --> 03:05:08.230 region:rollup2
ONE SIX BE. SO WE WILL LOOK AT

03:05:06.529 --> 03:05:08.998 region:rollup2
BOTH BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN AND

03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:09.999 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOK AT.

03:05:08.998 --> 03:05:11.834 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT.

03:05:09.999 --> 03:05:13.235 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAY NEED ME DEMAND

03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:15.604 region:rollup2
MORE MORE RESEARCH I THOUGHT I

03:05:13.235 --> 03:05:17.773 region:rollup2
SAW THAT IN THE THE LANGUAGE BUT

03:05:15.604 --> 03:05:18.441 region:rollup2
THEN WHEN WE.

03:05:17.773 --> 03:05:19.342 region:rollup2
.

03:05:18.441 --> 03:05:20.776 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ITEMIZE ALL THE

03:05:19.342 --> 03:05:21.477 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A REPORT IS

03:05:20.776 --> 03:05:23.145 region:rollup2
GOING TO LOOK INTO TRAIN.

03:05:21.477 --> 03:05:25.314 region:rollup2
I'M SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE WE

03:05:23.145 --> 03:05:26.882 region:rollup2
ADD SOME AVENUES OF RESEARCH

03:05:25.314 --> 03:05:28.317 region:rollup2
THAT COULD YIELD SOME POSITIVE

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:29.518 region:rollup2
DATA HERE INSTEAD OF JUST

03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:30.786 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THE ONES THAT

03:05:29.518 --> 03:05:32.555 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL YIELD NEGATIVE HERE

03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:33.456 region:rollup2
JUST TO BE UNBIASED ABSOLUTELY

03:05:32.555 --> 03:05:34.290 region:rollup2
