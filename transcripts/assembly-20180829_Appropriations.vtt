TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.190 region:rollup2

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.727 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED BURNS SAN.

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:48.661 region:rollup2
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ONE OF THE

OTHER ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:52.031 region:rollup2
HEARING ABOUT QUITE A BIT IS

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.299 region:rollup2
HARDENING OF NOT ONLY THE

INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR UTILITY

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.869 region:rollup2

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:58.437 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR HOMES.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.606 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE KNOW IS AN IMPORTANT

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:02.775 region:rollup2
ELEMENT RIGHT NOW WE REALLY

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:04.210 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO DOING

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:06.178 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THINGS

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.279 region:rollup2

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.583 region:rollup2
I END DOUBLE PAINTING WINDOWS

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.918 region:rollup2
ARE JUST SIMPLE THINGS THAT WE

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:15.154 region:rollup2
