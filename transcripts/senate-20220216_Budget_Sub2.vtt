ALMOST A HUNDRED YEAR OF.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.821
STOPPING FIRE IN THIS YEAR'S

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.356
THAT'S NOT NATURAL THAT'S

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.892
MILLION COST. ON TOP OF CLIMATE

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.961

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.115
TWENTY MILLION BOARD FEET. SO

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.084
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT FORCES

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:35.953
CONTINUALLY GROWING ALL THE TIME

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.621
AND IT'S STRESSING THE TREES WE

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.789

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:41.091
ALL THOSE ISSUES SO I WANT TO

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.559
OUT THE PICTURE OF THE- SIZE OF

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.228
THE- PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:45.662
YEAR'S. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.431
CONTINUE TO HAVE FIRES LIKE THE

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.633
DIXIE AND THE CALDOR. INTEL WE

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.002
DO. MANAGEMENT NOW WHY CAN'T WE

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.937
DO MANAGEMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:55.939
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TODAY IS

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.776
MAINLY- PACIFIC INDUSTRIES AS A

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:02.212
FEW. OTHER PRIVATE. THAT

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.814
FACILITIES THAT DO MANUFACTURING

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.251
OF LUMBER. WE'VE TRIED SO WE'VE

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.687
LOST SEVERAL MAYBE FIFTY OR

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.189
SIXTY BIOMASS STAND ALONE

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.524
BIOMASS PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:17.027
SEARS AND THE REASON WE DON'T

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:18.028
HAVE THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS TODAY

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.097
IS BECAUSE- THEIR POWER PURCHASE

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:23.433
AGREEMENTS. WERE NOT EXTENDED BY

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.002
THE UTILITIES BECAUSE THEY CAN

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.870
GET SOLAR AND WIND AT A CHEAPER

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.740
RATE FOR RENEWABLESSO I HAVE

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:32.542
POWER PLANTS SITTING IN CHESTER

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.711
I HAVEN'T I USED TO HAVE AN ALL

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.046

ARE TRYING TO BE RE PERMITTED.

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:42.019
TO COME BACK ONLINE. SO THERE'S

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:44.354
PLENTY OF MATERIAL OUT THERE BUT

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.889
NO PLACE TO TAKE IT. AND SO WHAT

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.357
WE'RE DOING WITH ALL THE MONEY

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.126
THAT YOU THIS LAID OUT WITH HIGH

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:50.761
BANK THE REASON WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.529
AYE BECAUSE BECAUSE A PRIVATE

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:53.997
LENDER WILL NOT LAND. AND YOU

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.365
WANT TO THE REASON WHY IS

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.800
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:59.202
CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF MATERIAL.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:02.873
TO DO THE BUSINESS MODEL. NOW TO

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:06.643
MY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO ASK THE

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.712
SECRETARY AND I WANT TO PREFACE

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.814
THIS WAS SAYING THIS IS TOUGH

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.783
THIS IS NOT EASY TO DO BECAUSE

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:16.653
WE HAVE TO AGENCIES. MANAGING

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.455
THE LANDSCAPE NUMBER ONE THE

00:49:18.522 --> 00:49:20.223
LARGEST AGENCY IS THE FEDERAL

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.893

RESOURCES FOR THE REST OF IT. SO

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:30.133
MY QUESTION IS. HOW ARE WE GOING

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.035
TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.771

NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO SO

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.877
THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE. OF A-

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.447
THE- PRODUCT IS COMING OUT- SO I

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:44.715
THIS IS A POLICY QUESTION

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:46.283
BECAUSE WE CAN THROW MONEY AT IT

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.251
ALL DAY. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.252

WHILE THEY WERE BURNING AND THE

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:53.503
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FOREST

THE STATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:20.931

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:28.872
FIRE WHICH WAS IN SISKIYOU

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.473
COUNTY WAS A SINGLE. LIGHTNING

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.542
STRIKE THREE. THAT THE POOR

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.110
SERVICE PUT A LINE AROUND DIDN'T

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:36.012
COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH IT LEFT.

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.048
AND THE WIND BLEW THE TREE OVER

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:40.016
AND IT AND THEN CALIFORNICUM

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:42.085
RESPOND BECAUSE WE HAD. WE LOST

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:44.187
WE LOST HOMES. BECAUSE THAT

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.623
POLICY. I WANT TO COST RIGHT NOW

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.725

FOR SOLUTIONS BUT I'M SURE I'M

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.165
POINTING OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.100
WE HAVE. THAT CANNOT CONTINUE IN

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.168
THE WILL THE FIRE WAS THE SAME

00:53:58.234 --> 00:53:59.402
WAY IT BURKE FOR FOUR DAYS

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.371
BEFORE THE FOR SERVICE RESPONDED

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:03.273
TO IT. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.375
TO SEE MILLION ACRE FIRES. UNTIL

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:07.310
WE START EXTINCTION AND I KNOW

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:09.679
IT'S TOO COLD YOU HAVE TO. GET

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:10.480
TO FIGHT FIRE. AT THE SAME TIME

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:12.148
YOU HAVE TO PREVENT. DO DO MADE

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:13.683
AS WE ARE HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND.

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:19.255
YOU. THAT THE FOR SERVICE COUNTS

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.757
TREATED ACRES AS ACRES BURNED.

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:22.292
THAT MEANS IF A WILDFIRE CAME

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.593
AND DESTROYED IT THEY COUNT THAT

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.894
IS TREATED. THAT'S THE WRONG

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:25.962
POLICY DISTRICT ARE NOT TREATED

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.964
THAT'S DESTROYED. TREATED ACRE

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.532
SHOULD BE. ACRES THAT WE'VE

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.901
ACTUALLY THE END. AND- AND FIRE

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:32.936

I CAN'T. STAND TO WATCH OR

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:43.747
FORCED CONTINUE TO BURN BECAUSE

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.482
WE CAN'T GET ALONG WITH THE FOR

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:47.684
SERVICE AND THEY NEED TO BE AT

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:49.052

THE INTENSITY OF THOSE FIRES. I

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.452
DO THINK ARE ARE OUR

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.920

DID NOT GET FUNDED THAT WE'RE

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:33.449
SEQUEL READY PROJECTS AT

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:34.651
THROUGHOUT MY DISK IS ROCK

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:36.352

SEQUEL READY PROOF PROJECTS. AND

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.337
YOU KNOW TOM PORTER LAST YEAR

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.473
SAID THEY COULDN'T GET THE MONEY

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:00.476
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN LOOKING

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.611
FOR MONEY. TO DO PROJECTS AND

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.446
NOW WE GOT MONEY WE CAN'T GET IT

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:04.214
DONE SO THERE'S OTHER AVENUES I

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.348
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.517
MONEY GO. TO THOSE AGENCIES THAT

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.786
CAN THAT DEL ALONG WITH CAL FIRE

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.387
BUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.388
READY. TO DO AND HOW THE

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:13.790
CONTRACTORS IN PLACE TO DO IT.

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:14.924
THANK YOU. WE WILL CERTAINLY

MISS CHIEF PORTER. WHO WAS A

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.862
FORCE FOR FIRST. AND HE DID HIS

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.897
JOB AS FIREFIGHTER CENTER

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.933
MCGUIRE. IF SOME QUESTIONS.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.869
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:26.436
IT'S JUST- IT'S GONNA DO A

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:28.838
COMMENT HERE IN IN THAT'S ON THE

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:31.174
ISSUE OF BIOMASS LOOK- YOU TAKE

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.575
A LOOK AT THE NORTH COAST. IN

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.110
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH BIOMASS AND

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.479
IN PARTICULAR. WHERE A DEPUTY

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.147
SECRETARY AND I'M O GRATEFUL

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.215
FOR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY'S

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.984
LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE SHE

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.819
COMES FROM VERY SIMILAR REGION-

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:45.121
EAST OF US AS WE LOOK AT IN

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.357
REGARDS TO. THAT HERE ON THE

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.292
NORTH COAST BUT- THERE'S TWO

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.227
ISSUES ON WHY BROWN AT BINANCE

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:53.029
IS NOT WORKING IN THE STATE.

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:55.331
NUMBER ONE. BUT WE DO NOT GIVE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.867
ASSURANCES. TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:00.703
WHO A BIOMASS PLANT THAT THAT

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:01.638
ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO BE

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:04.007
PURCHASED. AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:07.610
ABOUT. MAKING OUR FORESTS MORE

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:10.413
FIRE SAFE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.852
HAVE A RECIPROCAL. TO THAT STOCK

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.888
THAT IS IN THE FOREST. SECOND

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:21.257
ISSUE ON WHY VIOLENCE IS NOT AS

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:22.625
SUCCESSFUL AS IT COULD BE IN THE

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:25.595
STATE IS TRUCKING COSTS WE NEED

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.763
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE BIOMASS

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.731
POWER PLANTS LOCATED NEAR WHERE

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:31.234
THIS WORK IS HAPPENING AND IT'S

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:33.836
NOT HAPPENING AT THE OMENT SO

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.838
I'M ALL FOR TAKING A LOOK AT

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:38.341
INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN- USE

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:41.344
DOLLARS ON. FOR TIMBER BUT I'D

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.779
ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:45.214
BRASS TACKS OF IT NUMBER ONE WE

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:48.751
HAVE BIOMASS PLANTS ARE ON THE

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:50.386
NORTH COAST IN CENTER DOLLARS

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:53.323
DISTRICT BY THAT COULD EXPAND WE

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.590
HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKE

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.925
TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN EXPAND

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:58.261
BIOMASS IN NON IMPACTED AIR

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.130
BASINS I MIGHT ADD AS WELL. YET

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.666
WE ARE NOT A GUARANTEE COSTS FOR

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.369
A MEGAWATT HOUR IN NUMBER TWO

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.403
TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.238
BUDGET IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:10.206
WHEN IT COMES TO TRUCKING COSTS

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.274
SO I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.775
PIECE AND I KNOW THAT BY THE

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.477
CHAIR IS VERY FOCUSING ON THAT I

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:15.411
JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:17.280
COMMENT. CAN WE HAVE A RESPONSE

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.982
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND CAN

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:21.184
YOU EXPAND ON THE BIOMASS

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.353
FACILITIES THAT ARE DISTINCT ME

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.254
TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AND WHAT

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.357
IT WOULD TAKE IT'S AN INVESTMENT

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:30.626
TO ALLOW THEM TO MAKE. UP FUEL

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:32.428
IF THAT WORKS IF THAT WERE MORE

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:34.564
DESIRABLE OR SOME COMBINATION

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:39.769
THERE OF WITH THE. WITH THAT-

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.304
PRODUCT THAT COMES IN. YEAH I

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.272
WOULD THINK BROUGH SPEAKING. WE

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.874
KNOW WE NEED MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:47.643
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ZERO ONE ONE

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.012
DEATH PRESENTATION OUT OF THE

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:52.048
FOURTH. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.017
REMARKABLE FUNDING WILL NEVER

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.085
HAD BEFORE THANKS IN LARGE PART

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.553

MEETING THIS HEARING TODAY BUT

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.857
WE KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.592
PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN BEEN

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:05.762
REMOVING THE VEGETATION AND

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.863
ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY.

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:10.800
AND WHILE WE ARE REALLY BULLISH

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:13.469
ON NOON WHEN PRODUCTS LIKE THIS

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:14.804
MASK JIM BURKE CROP LAMINATED

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:17.607
TIMBER- WE RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.909
THE POINTS YOU MAKE WHICH AND

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:22.011
BIOMASS. YOU KNOW- THE FACILITY

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:25.081
EXIST TODAY ACTUALLY UTILIZE

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:29.318
THAT- UTILIZED THAT. EDUCATION I

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:30.553
THINK CENTER DOLLY YOU KNOW HIT

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.055
THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THERE'S

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.190
ATTENTION WHICH IS. YOU KNOW

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.224
SORT OF THE SOBRE LINING

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.593
RENEWABLE ARE BECOMING SO

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.729
INEXPENSIVE LIKE SOLAR AND WIND

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.465
IT IS- BIOMASS IT MUCH MORE

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.768
EXPENSIVE- TO GENERATE ENERGY

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:46.903
THAN THOSE CLEAN FORMS OF

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:49.972
ENERGY. AND THAT THEY'RE YOU

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.741
KNOW PPA IS FROM WE HEAR FROM

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.010
THE UTILITIES THAT- ARE

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.378
EXPENSIVE AND LEAD TO INCREASE

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:58.714
IN IN CONSUMER ELECTRIC

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:01.451
ELECTRICAL REYES. SO I THINK I

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:04.087
RECOGNIZE THAT FILE MATH PLANTS

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.155
YOU KNOW WHAT CLAIRE MORTON

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.690
ROLLED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.926
SPEAKS DOT COM AT THE SAME TIME

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.728
THE CHALLENGES- EXACERBATING

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.230
RATE INCREASES AND IN SOME

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.934
PLACES YOU KNOW USING LEGACY

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:18.468
TECHNOLOGIES GRADING CARE

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.635
POLLUTION. SO I THINK YOU KNOW

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.404
WHAT I'LL SAY SENATORS IN THIS

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:22.839
IS A POINT WELL TAKEN WHICH WHAT

ADMINISTRATION POSITION I MEAN

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.113
YOU KNOW I THINK THE BEST THING

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:33.749
BIOMASS PLANTS AND FINDING A WAY

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.552
TO ENABLE THEM TO OPERATE- YEAH

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.653
. BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS OR DO

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.021
YOU KNOW CREATING MANIFESTO.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.290
THIS OUT OF THE FOUR WE DO THE-

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.559
WILDFIRE. TO ALLOW I'LL TAKE

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:47.597

HAVE YOU NOTICED JUST A FOR OUR

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:56.739
- DATE WITH. THAT DIALOGUE WITH

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.074
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EACH CAN

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:03.713
AND OTHERS. ALSO ADAM THAT AND

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:04.614
THAT IF YOU AT OUR STRATEGY OR

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.617
HOW DO SHOULD MOVED MACHINE. OUT

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:11.087
OF THE COURT IN A CON- IT'S

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.555
ALMOST REFRESHING ARE TECH

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.090
AGNOSTIC IN CURRENTLY WHAT YOU

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.125
WITH TREAT AS TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.593
PART OF THAT TREAT COULD

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.262
POTENTIALLY GO TO LUMBER ARE THE

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.396
TOP OF THE TREE COULD GO TO

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.398
BIOMASS PART OF THREE CAN GO TO

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.133
PARTICLE BOARD. AND SO BECAUSE

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.502
THERE'S MULTIPLE USES FOR THE

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.271
WORD EVEN IN A SINGLE TREE THAT

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.272
YOU'RE REMOVING WE WANT TO MAKE

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.207
SURE THAT THAT WE ARE. THAT WE

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.009
ARE CREATING A FOUNDATION FOR

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.877
THAT ENTIRE ECONOMY AND THE BEST

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:38.281
USED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AND SO

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:39.715
WHETHER THAT'S A CRIME A%

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:40.216
CATALYST. OUR BUSINESS

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.018
DEVELOPMENT LOANS THIS OUTRAGE

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.686
PETITIONS SUBSIDIES TO GET THAT

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.254
MOVING OR THE FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.989
GUARANTEES WE'RE TRYING TO

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.824
CREATE STABILITY CONFIDENCE AND

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.093
ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN THE MARKET.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.595
SO THAT THE ECONOMY CAN HELP

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:53.896
DRIVE THAT AND YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.132
ABSOLUTELY- THAT AND SO I HOPE

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:57.767
THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM US

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.768
IS THAT WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.503
OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT I AM

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.438
TRYING TO FACILITATE AND EXPAND

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.973
ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES. THAT

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.676
CAN USE THAT MATERIAL AS OPPOSED

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.544
TO TRYING TO CREATE ONE SILVER

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:09.812
BULLET OR DRAG THE FORCED AN

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:13.816
ECONOMY IN ONE QUESTION- AND YOU

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.218
KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT AND YOUR

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:17.153
POINT YOU KNOW WIRE SOME OF

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.754
THESE. AND THE BIOMASS

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:19.889
FACILITIES ARE EXISTING

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:27.997
FACILITIES. THAT CAN. ALLERGY

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:31.033
THAT. OUR ARMED. YOU KNOW AND

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.535
WHEN WE'RE TO GET A LOOK SORT OF

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.103
CASE STUDIES THE ONE TO

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.771
DISTILLATE AND SENATOR DOLLARS.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:40.309
WHICH A WOULD BE. IS OF. THAT- A

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.011
- YOU KNOW IT IS NOT. SORT OF.

ENERGY I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:35.791
SERIOUSLY LOOK. AT EXPANSION OF

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:38.194
BIOMASS IN NON IMPACTED AIR BASE

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.328

NEEDS SERVED BUT I CAN'T GET A

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.202
PPA. POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT SO

CAN COME IN AND HELP. LOOK YOU

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:24.840
TALK ABOUT WIND AND SOLAR IS

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.376
CHEAPER GREEN ENERGY BUT THE

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.211
PUBLIC BENEFIT TO DO BIOMASS IS

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:31.514
THE- STOPS THESE CATASTROPHIC

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.149
FIRES IT HELPS WILDLIFE HELPS

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.283
OUR WATERSHED. THE PUBLIC

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.085
BENEFIT IS WAVING A BIGGER

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.020
BENEFIT THE COST MAY BE MORE ON

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.422
ELECTRICITY SIDE BUT THE PUBLIC

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.490
BENEFIT THIS IS. ENORMOUSLY

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.325
BETTER THAN WIND AND SOLAR AND

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.960
THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO THE

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.529
CALCULATION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT-

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:47.696
PERMITTING THESE PLANTS IT'S THE

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.365
PERMITTING PROCESS AND THE PPAS

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.033
THAT NEED TO BE AND WHAT SUPPLY.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.535
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS LOOK.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.836
SERVICES BECAUSE IT HAS CAN'T

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.271
TAKE ANYMORE LAWMAKERS ARE

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:56.772
CUTTING THEIR CUTTING ALL THE

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:57.807
DEAD TREES THAT THEY HAVE ON

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:58.874
THEIR OWN LAND THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.376
THE ISSUE TODAY. WE CAN MAKE

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.811
WOULD OUT OF WE CAN MAKE BOARDS

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.279
AND WE CAN MAKE BY MASS AT THE

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:04.313
SAME TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.648
STEADY SUPPLY. TO THESE PLANS

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:08.117
WHEN THEY'RE PLACED. CAN CAN RUN

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.152
FOR FORTY YEARS SO THEY CAN GET

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:10.753
BACK THEIR INVESTMENT. THAT'S

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.321
THE ISSUES. AND THAT'S IT'S GOOD

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.589
COMMONSENSE APPROACH WE'VE GOT

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.224
TO GET THAT REGULATORY PEOPLE

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:16.659
OUT OF THE WAY. GET CONTRACTS

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.594
AND THEN GO FOR PUTTING TEN

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:19.762
MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE FOR

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.530
HAULING IS GONNA DO. KEEP IN THE

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:22.798
A FEW THAT ARE OUT THERE RUNNING

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.467
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO. TAKE CARE

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.535
OF THE LONG TERM- PROBLEM THAT

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:29.038
WE HAVE WHICH IS A HUNDRED YEARS

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:29.672

AROUND FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING-

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:34.330
I THINK THE LANGUAGE SAYS- THAT

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:36.865
IN A WAY THAT PRIORITIZES

BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; OP CONDUCTING OUTREACH- IN&lt;/c&gt;

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:51.013
AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE HAD

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.982
HISTORIC HAVE HAVE HIS. WE HAD A

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:55.784
LOW APPLICATION OR PARTICIPATION

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.853
RATE. IN THE FIRE PREVENTION

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.023
GRANTS PROGRAM- AND THAT BY

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.191
FEBRUARY FIRST WE WERE GOING TO

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:06.362
HAV. A REPORT FROM CAL FIRE-

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.564

AWARDED SO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.705
DISPARITY OVER TIME AND THE

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:19.408
DIFFICULTY OF PREVENTING FIRE.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.543
IN THESE NOT JUST SOUTHERN

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.978
CALIFORNIA AREAS BUT THESE SORT

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.246
OF MORE DENSELY POPULATED

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.981
REGIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.950
FORESTRY CHALLENGES BUT- HAVE

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.219
MUCH MORE SORT OF COMPLEX IN THE

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:31.887
WEEDS CHALLENGES ARE IN THE

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.022
GRASS CHALLENGES IF YOU WILL

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:34.189
COULD BE IN THE BERKELEY HILLS

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:36.325
ARE IN ALAMEDA- COULD BE

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:37.793
RIVERSIDE COUNTY YOUR SAMBAR TO

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.328
DINO WE'RE DOWN IN ORANGE

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:43.666
COUNTY- BUT I ONLY. YOU KNOW I

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:47.302
SEE- A DROP OFF IN THE- PROPOSAL

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:50.839
FOR. FIRE PREVENTION ROGIC

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.308
FUNDING AND FROM THE ANALYSIS I

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.444
GOT FROM MY STAFF EVEN FOR THE

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.546
FORTY MILLION WE DID LAST YEAR-

01:11:57.613 --> 01:12:00.649
THERE'S STILL A PRETTY DRAMATIC

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.918
DISPARITY- WHERE WORST YOU'RE

OUT OF THE FLOOD CONTROL

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:16.349

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:54.120

OTHERS TODAY IN TERMS OF THE

01:59:58.824 --> 02:00:01.661
IMPORTANCE. OF BALANCING FIRE

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:02.828
SUPPRESSION WITH FIRE PREVENTION

02:00:02.895 --> 02:00:05.498
AND- FIRE PROTECTION- I THINK

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:06.999
WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO TALK MORE

02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:09.902
ABOUT- THAT PROTECTION. IT IS

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:11.137
SUPPOSED TO SUPPRESSION SO MUCH

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:12.872
IN IN THE SENSE THAT THE A FIRE

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.840
IN SOME CASES IS A GOOD THING

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:15.308
AND THAT'S PART OF THE

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:16.876
PREVENTION AND FORCED HEALTH-

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:19.111
SIDE OF THINGS AND SO. THERE

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:22.582
THERE IS NEED TO BE BALANCED BUT

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:28.187
REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO MAINTAIN

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:30.222
EXISTING CAPACITY. I THINK IT'S

02:00:30.289 --> 02:00:31.724
BEEN KIND OF WELL DOCUMENTED NOT

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.326
PARTY TO LEARN ALL THE DETAIL.

02:00:33.392 --> 02:00:34.460
THE CONDITIONS THAT OUR

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:36.762
FIREFIGHTERS ARE DEALING WITH

02:00:36.829 --> 02:00:38.664
YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. ARE JUST

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.066
NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE NEED TO

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:41.801
DO SOME THINGS TO SUPPORT. THE

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.002
FIREFIGHTERS SO THAT WE CAN

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:44.937
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN. EVEN JUST

02:00:45.004 --> 02:00:47.173
THE LEVEL OF. CAPACITY WE HAVE

02:00:47.239 --> 02:00:50.643
NOW. FOR FIRE PROTECTION- FROM

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.144
FIRE PREVENTION STANDPOINT WE

02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:53.512
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THIS IS A

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:55.448
IT'S A LONG TERM. ISSUE IT'S

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:56.215
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO THE

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:57.450
STATE'S GOING TO HAVE BEEN

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:59.118
WORKING ON FOR YEARS TO COME. OF

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:00.786
THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT IS

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:01.887
THERE IS THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:03.756
DOLLARS YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.257
G. G. R. AFTER HE'S BEEN CAN

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:06.459
CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE NOW AS A

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:07.727
PART OF LAST YEAR'S TRAILER

02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:10.129
BILL. EFFORTS SO THERE'S A

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:12.264
DEGREE OF ONGOING FUNDING THERE

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:14.066
AND THEN A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:16.168
ARE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. WE'RE

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:17.503
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET A GOOD

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.538
HANDLE I THINK. ON THE LEVEL OF

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:21.374
FUNDING THAT'S NECESSARY TO

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:24.076
SUSTAIN IT. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.045
SCENERY DID A GOOD JOB TALKING

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:26.545
ABOUT THE SPRINT VERSUS

02:01:26.612 --> 02:01:30.850
MARATHON. AND I MISS MORRIS

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:32.118
REALLY WORK. TALK ABOUT THAT

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.119
ANALOGY I THINK WERE LOOKING

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:35.421
DOING. FIGURE OUT. WITH A COUPLE

02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:37.323
OF YEARS OF INVESTMENT AND THE

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:39.291
OUTCOMES THAT COME FROM THAT AS

02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:40.326
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT.

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:41.727
MEASURE THAT. THAT WE'LL GET A

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:43.629
BETTER IDEA OF THE LEVEL SUSTAIN

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:45.164
FUNDING THAT'S NECESSARY AN ON

02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:49.268
GOING BASIS. TO MEET OUR GOAL OF

02:01:49.335 --> 02:01:49.835

AND I'M GOING TO. HAPPEN IS I

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:53.572

OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN TRYING

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:56.275
TO GET THEIR- INVESTMENTS IN

02:01:56.342 --> 02:01:58.444

REALLY IS THE TRUE BASELINE

02:02:08.387 --> 02:02:09.822
AMOUNT FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED NON

02:02:09.889 --> 02:02:11.457

WELL WE CAN'T FIRE FIGHTER WAY

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:11.650
OUT OF THEM. THAT SEEM LIKE THIS

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:13.185
IS AN AREA THAT THAT COULD USE

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:15.121
SOME ADDITIONAL FOCUS. AND WE'VE

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:16.388
CERTAINLY SEEN AS AS WAS

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:18.023
MENTIONED- BY THE PREVIOUS

HOWEVER WE DO FIND OVERALL THAT

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:27.466
THE PROPOSAL'S ON. DO YOU RESULT

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:29.769
IN A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN THE

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:45.184
CLEAR TO US THE EXTENT TO WHICH

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:46.051
SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WOULD

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.853
ENHANCE RESPONSE CAPACITY AND

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:48.954
OVER WHAT TIME FRAME AND WE

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:50.089
THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPOTANT

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.357
QUESTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:03:51.423 --> 02:03:52.358
MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING. KIND OF

02:03:52.424 --> 02:03:54.593
MOST FOR ITS DOLLARS. AND

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:56.128
FINALLY WE THINK THAT IT'S

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:58.664
IMPORTANT. FOR THE STATE TO HAVE

02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:00.232
THE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE PLAN TO

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:02.401
GUIDE ITS FUNDING ALLOCATIONS-

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:04.403
AND ASTHMA'S MENTIONED- YOU KNOW

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:06.438
IN THIS CONVERSATION. ON THE

02:04:06.505 --> 02:04:07.840
LEGISLATURE DID TAKE SOME

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:09.441
ACTIONS TO TRY TO GET THAT

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:11.243
INFORMATION THIS- BY REQUIRING

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.978
REPORT IS PART SOMEONE RECORDING

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.547
LANGUAGE. AND NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:15.948
TO IDENTIFY RESPONSE CAPACITY

02:04:16.015 --> 02:04:18.651
GAPS COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:20.953
AND GOALS FOR THE STATE I THINK

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:28.093
THAT'S REALLY- WOULD BE REALLY

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.862
VALUABLE STILL. ASSEMBLY REALLY

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:30.863
ANY OTHER OF THAT PLANET IT'S

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:31.931
ALL THAT CHALLENGING THE

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:32.698
LEGISLATURE WE STAY THINK YOU

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:34.133

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.367
DECISIONS- WE DO PROVIDE SOME

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.102
SPACE. WHEN WE CAN GROUP

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:02.294
MILLION. AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:03.929
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND THEN-

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:05.130
THERE'S SOME INFORMATION WE

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.832
RECOMMEND JOHNSON PROPOSAL VERY

02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:07.967
RECOMMEND HAVING DEPARTMENTS

02:05:08.033 --> 02:05:09.435

WE ARE COMMITTED PRETTY WITH A

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.974
CONTRACT COUNTY PROPOSAL I DON'T

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.442
THINK THERE AND THAT ONE MAY NOT

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.710
OF BEEN SUMMARIZED FOR THAT. FOR

02:05:17.776 --> 02:05:20.012

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:33.492
THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THE.

02:05:33.559 --> 02:05:34.093
STATE HAS HISTORICALLY DONE.

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:35.461
EXPAND THE STATE'S. ROLE IN

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:36.896
FINDING. CRAZY THINK THAT.

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:37.930
UNREASONABLE OF THE SCREENS FOR.

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:40.399
TO MAKE SOME LAMP- FUNCTIONS FOR

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:41.433
THE STATE ASSEMBLY. FIFTY WE

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.835

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.103
STATE OF OUR- SOME FUNDING THIS

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:47.706
. THOSE AND TWO PROPOSALS WERE

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:50.042
WITHHOLD ACTION BECAUSE THEY-

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.676
TWO GROUPS OF PROPOSALS BECAUSE

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:51.777

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.345
MILLION WE TALK ABOUT THEM JUST

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:54.446
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL. ON

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:56.181
IT'S REALLY HARD TO. SORT OF GET

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.317
OUR HEADS AROUND HIM. IT'S HARD

02:05:58.384 --> 02:05:59.285
TO SORT OF PROCESS- BECAUSE WE

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:00.653
DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH IN THE

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:01.553
WAY DETAILS WERE EXPECTING THAT.

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.322
HOPEFULLY IN THAT SPRING- BUT

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.423
THOSE PROPOSALS INCLUDE THE

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:05.391
EMERGENCY SEARCH CAPACITY

STAFFING FOR THE HELICOPTERS IS

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:17.636
INCLUDED IN THAT OTHER FOUR

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.004
HUNDRED MILLION. I THINK ABOUT

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:20.406
THOSE TOGETHER YEAH CAN I TAKE

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.441
ACTION ON THE ON THE HELICOPTERS

NOT AND YOU KNOW THE FUNDING I'M

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:27.379
KIND FOR STOPPING THEM. AND WE

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:28.514
ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S A

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.448
PARTICULARLY TOUGH ONE AND WE IN

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:31.517
OUR MINDS TO IT REALLY. FAST

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:32.551
WITHOUT THIS KIND OF STRATEGIC

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:34.887
WELFARE PLAN. SO WE SIT WE

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:35.988
RECOMMEND THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:37.690
GOING TO TAKE YOU THINK ABOUT IT

IN WHOLE OR IN PART. AND THEN

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:44.229
THERE. ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES FOR

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:45.764
EXAMPLE ONE POTENTIAL THING

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:47.499
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS.

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:49.034
APPROVING SOME OF THE- SOME OF

02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:51.437
THEM RESOURCES NOW HOLDINGS I'M

02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:52.371

HELICOPTERS WILL TAKE ABOUT A

02:06:57.543 --> 02:06:59.244

SLOW DOWN THE ACQUISITION OF

THOSE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE

02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:09.688
US. TWO YEARS TO GET TO THE

02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:11.423
BOTTOM AND THEN FOUR YEARS TO

02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:13.859
GET FORM EITHER WAY- SO THE

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:15.160

THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN USE

MIGHT BE SURPLUS OTHERWISE. I'M

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.695
TO MEET THAT PURPOSE- WE THINK

02:08:23.762 --> 02:08:24.496
THAT DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE

02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:26.799
TO ARTICULATE THE SPECIFIC-

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.834

REPLACED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND

02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:21.847
ALSO REFRESHING- KEPT THEIR CAD

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:24.082
SYSTEM AS WELL- ON THAT ONE

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:25.217
RECOMMENDING THE DEPARTMENT

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:26.785
REPORT ON THE BENEFIT. OF

THEN ACTINIUM NOTE THE ADL'S

02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:36.728
ADDED WHEN YOU CARDS ARE

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.530
PURCHASED SO I'M YOU KNOW

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:39.665
THERE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE EVERY

02:10:39.731 --> 02:10:42.034
FRESH AS PART OF THAT- REFRESH

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.802
AND JUST WHEN YOU KNOW CARS ARE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:44.836
CHANGED OUT BECAUSE THEY GOT

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:46.438
OLDER SO. IT'S NOT GOING TO ASK

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:48.240
WHY- THAT REFRESH RATE WOULD BE

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:50.375
NECESSARY AND- NO REALLY IT'S

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:50.809
PRETTY EXPENSIVE ARE

02:10:50.876 --> 02:10:52.077
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IT'S MORE

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:53.779
THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:54.446

REFRESHING EVERY FIVE YEARS IT

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.555
STARTS ADDING UP QUITE A BIT. SO

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:04.957
WE THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING THE

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:06.225
LEGISLATURE SEEING IT OPTIONS ON

02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:07.926

THOSE ARE AT ARMS OVERALL AND I

02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:28.046

THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS PROGRAM

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:15.853
IS THAT- WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:17.488
THESE ENGINES ARE ALL RISK ALL

02:28:17.555 --> 02:28:19.357

PARTNERSHIP WE ASSIGN THEM TO

02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:25.496
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:27.798
DEPARTMENTS SO BASICALLY THE

02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:28.933
LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATION WE HAVE

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.368
AN AGREEMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN USE THE

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:33.471
ENGINE AS A SECONDARY ENGINE IF

02:28:33.537 --> 02:28:35.673
THEY NEED TO PART LOCAL RESPONSE

02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:37.241
BUT IN ESSENCE WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:40.344
THAT WHEN I'M DISASTER OR

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:41.746
EMERGENCY OCCURS THE STATE OF

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:43.681
SIGNIFICANCE. WHAT WE NEED TO

02:28:43.748 --> 02:28:45.616

LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIREFIGHTERS SO

02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:05.736
THEY BECOME NOW. QUOTE UNQUOTE

THE STATE'S FIRE. SURE AND WE

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:09.774
MOVED. AROUND THE STATE TO

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.809
ADVANCE WHATEVER THEY ARE AND WE

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:13.978
TYPICALLY REIMBURSE THOSE FIRE

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:16.447
DEPARTMENTS FOR THEIR PERSONNEL

02:29:16.514 --> 02:29:18.783
ONLY WHEN WE USE THAT- AND WE

02:29:18.849 --> 02:29:20.418

PROGRAM OR U. S. FOREST SERVICE.

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:35.499
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:29:35.566 --> 02:29:37.068
WAYS TO REIMBURSE THE

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:37.968
FIREFIGHTERS WHEN THEY'RE

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:40.137

VEHICLES RIGHT AND THOSE ARE

02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:12.136
THOSE ARE DESIGNED ALL TO

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:13.971

THAT WE ARE STILL SHORT. BEYOND

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:31.922

THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS WORK WEEK

02:50:48.237 --> 02:50:49.839

FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. SO THE IDEA

02:50:56.779 --> 02:50:58.715
OF MOVING TO A FIFTY SIX HOUR

02:50:58.781 --> 02:51:00.683
