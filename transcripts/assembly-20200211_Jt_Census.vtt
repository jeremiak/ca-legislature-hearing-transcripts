00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.376
THEY MADE ME A PROMISE- WOULD

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.178
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:52.678
PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.347
REQUESTED THAT THE STATE PUT UP

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.082
I THINK IT WAS AT THAT TIME.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.084
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SAID

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.786

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.554
OTHER STATES BUT OF A HUNDRED

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.455
EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION. SO I

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:03.656

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.764
NEED TO BECAUSE THE STATE HAS.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.332
PUT SO MUCH MONEY TOWARDS IT BY

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.867
NO THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.036
JUST AS- DOING A LOT OF TO FILL

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.204
IN THE GAPS WHERE THE STATE

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.106

CALIFORNIANS- THAT ARE THE

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.832
HARDEST TO COUNT SO THAT IS

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:37.702
THAT INDEX THAT WE'VE REFERRED

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.236
TO IT AS SOMETHING UNIQUE.

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:40.138
FORMULA THAT WE REALLY USE DOES

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.240
THAT IS FOR THAT DATA I'M

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:44.475
TAKING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

TO POINT THAT OUT- AND IT WILL

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.384
SHOW YOU HOW THOSE TEN REGIONS

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:56.020
ARE DIVIDED- AND SO WITH THAT

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:58.356
WORK SORT OF THE FIRST SLAYER-

00:30:58.423 --> 00:30:59.557
IS REALLY THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:02.126
COMMUNITY BENEFIT-

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.528
ORGANIZATION- WHO IS HELPING

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.897
TO. COURT ACTIVITIES ON THAT

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:06.664
ARE HAPPENING IN ANY GIVEN

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.434
REGION- YOU BECAUSE OF THE

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.768
COMPLEXITY OF OUR STATE. I'M

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.503
BOTH WITH POPULATION IN

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.539
GEOGRAPHY AND SO ON- THEY ARE

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.341
MUCH DIFFERENT. I'M FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.643
REGION EIGHT- LOS ANGELES IT IS

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.179
THE COUNTY IN AND OF ITSELF- AS

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.880
WELL AS THE SINGLE COUNTY WHERE

00:31:22.947 --> 00:31:25.116
IS IN REGION ONE- IT IT. IT IS

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.651
THE RETURN WHICH IS COMPRISED

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.386
OF THAN SEVENTEEN COUNTIES. AND

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:30.622
SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:33.758
CHALLENGES THAT EACH OF. ARE

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.494
ORGANIZING OF LAYERS HAVE IN

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:37.695
COORDINATION ARE DIFFERENT AND

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:40.164
UNIQUE- SO WE REALLY KNOWLEDGE

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.433
THAT YOU KNOW I COME FROM THE

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.035
SPACE FOR I GOT TO WORK- WITH

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.370
FAIR GROUNDS. AND WHILE THEY

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.938
ARE SO SIMILAR THEY ARE ALSO

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.440
UNIQUE- AND SO INCREASING THAT

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:51.743
UNIQUENESS- EACH OF THOSE-

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:54.846
REGIONS- THEN PARTNER WITH. FOR

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:57.649
EXAMPLE THE COUNTY OFFICES OF

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.617

BE HELPFUL IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:05.685
COMMUNICATE WITH PROBABLY A

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:08.254
DISTRICT OFFICES IN THE

THAT'S IN A STRICT THERE

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:24.671
SOMETHING LKE THAT I REALIZE

01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:27.207
IT'S A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO DO

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:31.644
BUT- THIS. IS NOT. RISING

01:52:31.711 --> 01:52:33.913
TARGET ARE THE COUNT FIVE. THAT

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.481
TRYING TO FIGURE HOW TO MAKE

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:36.916
THAT. MORE THE OTHER THING THAT

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:38.618
I JUST WANNA SAY IS THAT IT'S

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:41.020

THINK. PEOPLE GET EARNERS LIKE

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:02.542
WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:05.078
GOING ON AND THEY'RE NOT.

ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE WHAT WE'RE

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:13.686
WORKING ON IT AND- GREAT. DANTE

01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:19.859
AND TO WORK OUT BUT. FOURTH

01:53:19.926 --> 01:53:21.094
BECAUSE PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE

ALL THE RESOURCES TO FIGURE OUT

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.635
HOW TO MAXIMIZE. EVERYBODY IT'S

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.236
NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.905
PERFORMANCE IN THE END IT'S

01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:32.839
ABOUT OUR COLLECTIVE

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:33.940
PERFORMANCE WHICH IS GONNA BE

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:35.141
RESPECTED BY WHAT THE FINAL

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.609
COUNT IS. ONLY FINISH YOUR

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:39.078
SENSES AT A AT ULTIMATELY

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.813
THAT'S THE TRUE MEASURE OF OUR

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.948
SUCCESS WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE-

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:44.050
METRIC IN WHICH IS WHY. THE

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:45.251
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WHO IS

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:46.386
THIS THING ROLLS OUT WITH THAT

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:48.188
IF I GAPS AND HOLES HOW WE

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:50.623
BECAUSE IN THE END. YOU'LL IT

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.157
REALLY MATTERS IS THAT WE

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:52.992
CANNOT EVERYBODY ARE NOT. HOW

01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:54.627
