ON THE INTERNET AND THE GOAL OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SECURITY IS TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND HER WEAKNESSES AND CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE HUMAN SECURITY FOR ITS RESIDENTS. AND PRODUCE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE WEAKNESSES AND HELP US PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WHILE THE WORLD AROUND US IS SHE IS SHAPING US LESS AND WE ARE IMPACTING THE WORLD MORE AND BY DOING SO IT IS DESTABILIZING MANY SYSTEMS WE DEPEND ON FOR SURVIVAL. THE SELECT COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT TOPICS INCLUDING ADEQUATE ACCESS TO WATER FOOD HEALTH CARE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC SECURITY THROUGH THE LENS OF HUMAN SECURITY. HUMAN SECURITY TAKES AN ALL ENCOMPASSING VIEW TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO THESE NEEDS COLLECTIVELY EVALUATED THE NECESSARY RESPONSE AND MITIGATION TACTICS TO SUPPORT THE SURVIVAL OF LIVELIHOOD. AND DIGNITY OF ALL PEOPLE. RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF SUCH AN APPROACH OUR FIRST TEAM WILL FOCUS ON THE HIDDEN HUMAN IMPACTS THE DROUGHT HAS HAD ON A TWO CALIFORNIANS. DROUGHTS HAVE FAR REACHING IMPACTS INCLUDING THE WELL BEING OF COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL. AND TOO OFTEN. THESE HUMAN IMPACTS ARE OVERLOOKED WELL WE ASSESS THE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF WATER TO CITIES AND TOWNS. WE SOMETIMES MISS THE IMPACTS THAT DROUGHT HAS ON FOOD SECURITY HEALTH LABOR AND THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES. CLIMATE CHANGE WILL EXACERBATE THESE IMPACTS PARTICULARLY IN THE MOST VULNERABLE REGIONS AND AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS THAT ARE FACING POVERTY AND ON EQUAL ACCESS TO WATER AT THE SAME TIME AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE WORSE EXISTING WATER STORAGES. THE WESTERN STATES WILL BE HIT THE HARDEST AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING THIS. AS WE ALL KNOW WATER ISSUES ARE ALSO FOOD ISSUES. CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO LEGALLY RECOGNIZED THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. DESPITE THIS OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. ACCESS TO FOOD AND WATER WILL HAVE GREAT IMPACT ON OUR- FUTURE HUMAN SECURITY DICTATING WHERE PEOPLE MOVE AND LOVE. THEIR DIETS AND OUR ECONOMY. THE IMPACTS OF WATER SHORTAGES WILL BE FELT IN OUR GROCERY STORES AS MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ALREADY EXPERIENCING AS FOOD PRICES SKYROCKET AND FOOD VARITY AND AVAILABILITY PLUMMETS. PRIOR TO THE COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE FOOD INSECURITY. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE THE DEEPLY ROOTED INEQUITIES THAT ENDANGER THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS HEART DISEASE DIABETES AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE. NOT HAVING ENOUGH HEALTHY FOOD CAN HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR EIGHT ONE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND FUTURE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE PRODUCE TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION'S FRUITS AND NUTS AND ONE THIRD OF ITS VEGETABLES. IMPACTS OUR WHOLE COUNTRY AS CALIFORNIANS. AS CALIFORNIA WORKS TO IMPROVE WATER ACCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY. AN OVERRIDING CONCERN IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE TO MAGNIFY MANY OF THE ISSUES WE'RE CURRENTLY FACING AND- THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL NOT BE ENOUGH THE BILITY TO PLAN EFFECTIVELY WILL BE ESSENTIAL. BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO BURST TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IT NOW FREESTYLE ONCE AGAIN THE NUMBER IS 844-291-4364 WHAT PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE THREE FIVE THREE. ONE TWO EIGHT THREE. NOW BEFORE WE MOVE IT GET STARTED WITH OUR PANEL I WANT TO. GIVE AT THE OPENING REMARK OPPORTUNITY TO SENATOR MELENDEZ WHO IS PART OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE KNOWN AS THE- SELECT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SECURITY AND I BUT I DID MAKE A JOKE AWHILE BACK ABOUT IT BEING THE- THE COMMITTEE A ON THE TICKET OF US SENATOR MELISSA. GETS RIDICULOUS IS ON THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND CENTER MELINDA'S. PEACEFUL TO. HAVE SOME OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT. OKAY YES IT IS THE MELISSA CAUCUS TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ASKED ME TO BE PART OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN TAKING A LOOK AT THE MANY PROBLEMS FACING EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS. TO INCLUDE HOUSING ECONOMIC STABILITY PUBLIC SAFETY AND ESPECIALLY WATER. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN TRULY SHED LIGHT ON THE NEGLECTED PROBLEMS IMPACTING SO MANY PEOPLE. IN INDUSTRIES IN OUR STATE AND HOW THE POLICIES WE ENACT HERE MAY EXACERBATE OR HELP SOLVE. THOSE PROBLEMS AND LIKE YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A VERY LARGE AGRICULTURAL AREA IN MY DISTRICT. THAT RELIES ON SUSTAINABLE WATER SUPPLY TO GROW ALL OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO EAT IN CALIFORNIA AND SENT TO OTHER STATES. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE STATE WATER COMMISSION APPROVAL OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE SITES RESERVOIR PROJECT THAT WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO AVOID DROUGHTS AND WATER SHORTAGES BUT WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT MORE IS NEEDED. THOSE FARMS EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF WORKERS EVERY YEAR. BUT WITHOUT WATER THOSE FIELDS REMAIN FALLOW AND ARE FROM WORKERS KILLING HIM FLOYD. THIS ONE EXAMPLE THE LACK OF WATER AFFECTS NOT JUST THE FOOD BEING GROWN IN THESE AREAS BUT THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT JOBS WORKERS CAN'T PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES OR HOMES OR FOR THEIR CHILDREN ARE HOME FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP IN. SO IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THESE TOPICS. AND SEE HOW WE AS POLICYMAKERS CAN LESSEN THE BURDEN SO MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE. STARTING A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS HARD AND IT IS GROWING INCREASINGLY ON AND TRACK UNATTRACTIVE TO ENTREPRENEURS WHICH IS WHY WE SEE BUSINESSES FLEEING OUR STATE. EVEN AS EXISTING BUSINESSES SUFFER FROM LOOTING AND RANDOM ACTS OF CRIME. THAT TOO OFTEN GO UNPUNISHED. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE LACK OF GROCERY STORES CONTRIBUTING TO FOOD AND SECURITY BUT AS CRIMINAL ACCOUNT ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO RISE MORE OF THESE STORES ARE GOING TO REFUSE TO GO INTO THESE COMMUNITIES WHO SO DESPERATELY NEED THEIR SERVICES. WE CANNOT HAVE A VIABLE ECONOMY WITHOUT JOBS WE CANNOT SOLVE FOOD INSECURITY WITHOUT BUSINESSES FEELING SAFE AND IN ORDERTO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO IMPROVING OUR BUSINESS CLIMATE. HOUSING IS UNAFFORDABLE PARTIALLY BECAUSE ALL OF ALL THE COSTS WHICH INCLUDE LABOR AND THE PERMITTING IN THE ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS EQUAL EDUCATION GREEN BUILDING INITIATIVES AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. AND ALL THESE THINGS GOING TO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT BEFORE SHOVEL IS EVEN TURNING THE EARTH. AN ENERGY IS EXPENSIVE IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE IT'S PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE. YOU KNOW WE NEED AIR CONDITIONING IN THE IN THE DESERT PART OF MY DISTRICT IT'S- A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN THE SUMMER PEOPLE CAN'T GO WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING BUT OF COURSE THAT PLAYS. PLACES A LARGE BURDEN ON OUR ELECTRICAL GRID. WE HAVE TRIED TO USE AN INCENTIVIZED GREEN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND AND SOLAR WHICH WE HAVE MUCH OF. IN MY DISTRICT BUT THEY SIMPLY DON'T PRODUCE ENOUGH ENERGY WHEN THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING. OR THE SUN ISN'T SHINING SECRETING AN ENERGY RELIANCE AND OTHER STATES AND MAKING ELECTRICITY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS. IS LIKELY NOT THE PATH WE WANT TO CONTINUE DOWN. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO HAVE A RELIABLE ENERGY GRID SYSTEM AND SO I DO HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US. TO ENSURE THAT ROLLING BLACKOUTS BECOME LESS FREQUENT IF NOT. NONEXISTENT AS A COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO INFLATION I THINK THE TIMING OF THIS HEARING. AND THE MANY TOPICS WE WILL COVER THIS SESSION WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKING CALIFORNIA MORE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. SO I DO LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY ON WATER TO HELP THE OTHER TOPICS ARE BROUGHT FORWARD CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE. TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES CAN BE VIABLE PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK FOR EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR MELENDEZ AND- AS YOU ALL HEARD TODAY I MEAN. THERE IS A LOT OF- IT'S GOING TO JUST ADD THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY HEARINGS YET TO COME THAT WILL FOCUS ON HUMAN SECURITY THAT WILL BE FOCUSED ON. PROTECTING MANKIND AND I'M SO EXCITED TO. HAVE SENATOR MELINDA IS WITH ME HERE TODAY BUT I AM ALSO EXCITED FOR ALL OF OUR- GUEST SPEAKERS WHO WILL AND EXPERTS. IN IN B. AREA FULL OF WATER AND FOOD. AND HEALTH. HOW ARE HUMAN SECURITY IS- IMPACTED BY BY THE DROUGHT. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. AT AND THAT WE HAVE THE STATE OF WATER WHERE ARE WE NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER RACHEL OWNS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WELCOME. Q. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR MELINDA'S RACHEL EHLERS WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GONNA TRY AND SHARE MY SCREEN HERE THIS IS ALWAYS THE SCARY PART YOU CAN GET IT WORKING. AND THEN IT KICKED OFF LET'S SEE. YES. YES WE CAN OKAY- WELL THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME I THINK MY JOB HERE TODAY IS JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT SETTING ON THE KIND OF STATUS OF THE DROUGHT THAT WERE IN AND SOME BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND WHERE WE'VE BEEN OVER THE PAST SORT OF A DECADE OR SO HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL- TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR YOUR SUBSEQUENT SPEAKERS SO HERE'S MY PLAN FOR WHAT I'LL TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES- FIRST JUST IN HISTORY OF THE MORE OF THE MOST RECENT DROUGHT AND WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT DONE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE DROUGHT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW SH- TALK ABOUT SOME FACTORS THAT EXACERBATE DROUGHT IMPACTS WHY IS IT GOTTEN SO BAD SO FAST. THIS TIME AND THEN- HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF SOME RECENT LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. SO FIRST THIS IS THE GRAPH OF OUR PRECIPITATION OVER THE PAST FIFTY YEARS AND YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE LOTS OF UPS AND DOWNS OF DROUGHT IS NOTHING NEW IN CALIFORNIA- BUT I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT. THE MOST RECENT FIFTEEN YEARS SO YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE SMART. OR DOWN THEN UP AND THIS AND THIS PERIOD. WE TALK ABOUT HAVING A SERIOUS DROUGHT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND SIXTEEN AND THEN NOW AGAIN IN TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE. BUT ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS WE'VE HAD A REALLY DRY FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH FIVE WAIT YEARS SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THERE. SO I THINK THAT SOME HELPFUL PERSPECTIVE TO THINK ABOUT CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND- WELL YOU KNOW AGAIN WHY THINGS GOT SO BAD SO QUICKLY HERE IS THAT WE REALLY HAVE HAD A PRETTY DRY PERIOD OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO. LUCKILY IF YOU WAIT YEARS IN BETWEEN THERE BUT BUT BUT IT DOES HAVE CUMULATIVE CHANCE OF SACKS- SERVICE I JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE LAST DROUGHT AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT PROGRESSED AND GOT WORSE INSTEAD OF BUNCH OF RECORDS. I'M NOT POSITIVE ONES. I HAD TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS THE DRIEST CONSECUTIVE FOUR YEAR STRETCH ON RECORD. AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS THE THIRD DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD AT THE TIME IN TERMS OF PRECIPITATION- SO PRETTY SEVERE DROUGHT. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FROM THAT DROUGHT WERE. THAT THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS LOSING WATER THEIR DOMESTIC WELLS GOING DRY OR BECOMING CONTAMINATED. THAT VERY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SURFACE WATER DELIVERIES FROM OUR STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS WHICH LED TO A DECREASE IN AGRICULTURAL CROP. CROP PRODUCTION AS WAS REFERENCED BY ON BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS AND I'M SURE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN YOUR SUBSEQUENT PANELS- WHAT ACTS OF BATCH- WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALWAYS USED OUR GROUNDWATER IS OUR SAVINGS BANK WHEN WE HAVE DRY YEARS WE GO WITH THE DRAW FROM OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN THE GROUND AND THEN IN WHAT YEARS. REPLENISH BUT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE DROUGHT AND AGAIN SOME OF THESE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS WE HAVEN'T BEEN REPLENISHING- SIGNIFICANTLY OR UP TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE BEEN PUMPING WHICH IS LED TO OVER DRAFT IN SOME AREAS AND SOME SIDE ENDS WITH THE GROUND. YOU KNOW DROPPING AND CAUSING DAMAGE AND WE SAW THAT- VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST DROUGHT. IN THE URBAN SAID THE BIGGEST IMPACT IN THE LAST ROUTE WAS INCREASED CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS TO USE LAST GOVERNOR BROWN. HAD A 25% MANDATORY REDUCTION DURING THE LAST DROUGHT AND WE SAW THAT WHERE YOU STRAP AND NOT SOME OF THAT WATER USE DROP HAS BEEN SUSTAINED SINCE THEN THERE WERE SOME PERMANENT REDUCTIONS FROM THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW TAKING OUT LINES ARE REPLACING SHOWER HEADS ARE TOILETS IN URBAN SETTINGS WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT REDUCTION IN USE OF SUSTAINED. DURING THE LAST YEAR WE HAD SEVERAL VERY SEVERE WILDFIRES THAT WERE. FUELED IN PART BY A HISTORIC TREE DIE OFF IN OUR FORESTS. WE LOST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FROM DRY CONDITIONS AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A- WIDE SCALE INFESTATION OF. BARK BEETLES WHICH KILLED- CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THAT TREE DIE OFF. AND THAT CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO THOSE FIRES- AND THEN I HAVE SOME PRETTY SEVERE IMPACTS TO HABITAT IN PARTICULAR PRODUCT HABITATS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. SO IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOOK SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ACTIONS DURING THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DROUGHT AND IN A COUPLE YEARS FOLLOWING THAT THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE INFLUENCING THE CONDITIONS WERE IN RIGHT NOW- SO THE FIRST WAS. VERY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING A LOT OF IT FROM PROPOSITION ONE WHICH VOTERS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR WATER SUPPLY AND STORAGE. SO THAT WHY THAT THOSE FUNDS HAVE WERE APPROPRIATED MOST NOT ALL BUT MOST DURING THE LAST DROUGHT BUT THOSE PROJECTS TAKE A LONG TIME TO. KIND OF GET PERMITTED GET CONSTRUCTED GET GET ON THE GROUND SO- I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE FRUITS OF THOSE PROJECTS NOW IS THAT SOME OF THEM ARE STARTING TO BE COMPLETED. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ALSO SOUGHT PASSAGE OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OR SIGMA WHICH WAS THAT HISTORICAL AS AS YOU ARE NOW- FIRST STATEWIDE EFFORT TO REGULATE GROUNDWATER. THERE WAS ALSO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. WATER CONSERVATION LEGISLATION A LITTLE BIT LATER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TRY AND SUSTAIN SOME OF THAT BUT GOALS AND TARGETS THAT WERE SET UP DURING THE LAST ROUND AND LEAD TO MORE. PERMANENT WATER EFFICIENCY PRACTICES. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE STOPPED PASSAGE OF THE SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND LEGISLATION SB TWO HUNDRED WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR TEN YEARS. FOR A DRESSING SOME OF THE DRINKING WATER ISSUES THAT WE SAW HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE LAST DROUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT THE DROUGHT EXACERBATED TO SOME OF THOSE DRINKING WATER ISSUES BUT SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY LONG STANDING ISSUES. THAT WERE JUST HIGHLIGHTED. DURING THE LAST ROUTE SO THAT THAT NEW PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE LONG TERM ISSUES ARE WITH SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IT WAS ALSO LEGISLATION PASSED THAT PROVIDED THE STATE WITH AUTHORITY NEW AUTHORITIES TO HELP CONSOLIDATE SOME WATER SYSTEMS POORLY PERFORMING WATER SYSTEMS. IN CASES WHERE VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS ARE HAPPENING THE STATE NOW HAS ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO TRY AND MAKE THOSE HAPPEN IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT. PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE SMALLER MORE RURAL WATER SYSTEMS. THAT JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE TO OPERATE AND AREN'T FUNCTIONING WELL ON THEIR OWN CAN BE PART OF A LARGER SYSTEM- AND THEN FINALLY SOME NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED FOR WATER USERS JUST SO WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE OF THIS IS AS A STATE. AS A STATE OF WHO'S USING HOW MUCH WATER WHERE THAT REALLY HELPS INFORM WHEN THERE ARE CURTAILMENTS- NEEDED JUST TO GET A BETTER SENSE. SO I HAD A LADIES IN PART BECAUSE THEY ARE HELPING US HOPEFULLY IN THE CURRENT DROUGHT BUT ALSO JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT EMERGENCY THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT THE STATE AND LEGISLATURE CAN DO OTHER THAN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE YOU KNOW GETTING BOTTLES OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES I DON'T HAVE THEM. BUT IT REALLY WHAT. IS IMPORTANT TO KIND OF HAVE THAT I. ON WHAT'S THE NEXT ROUTE THAT WILL COME IN FUTURE YEARS WHAT CAN WE DO NOW BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CHANGES REALLY DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO PUT IN PLACE WHETHER IT'S- PROVIDING FUNDING FOR. A NEW WATER RECYCLING. FACILITY TO INCREASE WATER SUPPLY- OR OR CONSOLIDATING WATER SYSTEMS YOU KNOW THAT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN WITHIN A WEEK OR A MONTH THAT TAKES YEARS AND SO. SOME OF THE POLICY SETTING UP NEW WATER CONSERVATION TARGETS YOU KNOW THESE THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS CAN TAKE YEARS. SO LUCKILY WE HAD SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS DURING THE LAST STRAW THAT HAVE WE'RE HELPING US NOW BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THING FOR. THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND I HAVE- THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE KIND OF A LONGER. TERM VIEW AND THEN SOME OF THESE CASES. TEN OUT TO THE DROUGHT WERE IN MIDST OF IT NOW- AT TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE OR GET EXCEPTIONALLY WARM AND EXCEPTIONALLY DRY- WE- WE BROKE THE RECORD AGAIN WITH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- IN TERMS OF PRECIPITATION OUTS THE THIRD DRIEST. ON RECORD THE SECOND DRIEST BASED ON HOW MUCH RUNOFF WE HAD. SO IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY I THINK ACTUALLY THREE DIFFERENT STATES OF EMERGENCY ADDING ADDITIONAL COUNTIES. IN EACH ONE SO THAT NOW EVERY EVERY FIFTEEN ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IS COVERED BY THE STATEWIDE- DROUGHT STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS FIGURE HERE IT SHOWS YOU ABOUT WATER RUNOFF- EXCUSE ME- WATER FLOW FOR VARIOUS RIVERS IN THE STATE AS OF SEPTEMBER SO IT'S NOT CREDITS IT'S A FEW MONTHS OLD. BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO SEE HERE IS IF YOU LOOK IN THE LEFT COLUMN SAYS TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. THE MIDDLE EAST TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THE RATE IS TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. SO FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN WHERE THE FOURTH AND FIFTH YEARS EIGHT OF THE OF THE LAST DROUGHT- THIRTY FOURTH YEARS YOU KNOW THE LATTER END OF THE LAST DROUGHT. AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IS ONLY THE SECOND YEAR OF THIS TRIAL AND IT'S ALREADY AT AT COMPARABLY LOW LEVEL SO I THINK THAT POINT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS. IS AGAIN HOW QUICKLY IT GOT BAD WE'RE ONLY IN YEAR TWO OF THIS DROUGHT BUT IT- THAT THE LEVELS GOT PRETTY BAD PRETTY QUICKLY. I'LL TALK IN A MINUTE. ABOUT WHY THAT MIGHT BE- SO TURN TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS CURRENT DROUGHT AND AGAIN I KNOW YOUR PAIN NEXT COUNCIL GET INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL BUT JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL. AGAIN WE'VE SEEN SURFACE WATER ALLOCATIONS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE STATE WATER PROJECT ONLY DELIVERED 5% OF THAT CONTRACT AMOUNTS. LAST YEAR AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT NO WATER DELIVERIES FOR SOME OF THE- AGRICULTURAL. CONTRACTORS SOUTH OF THE DELTA SH- WE SAY GROUNDWATER LEVELS DROPPING AGAIN SO THAT'S WHAT THIS PICTURE HERE IN THE SLIDE SHOWS- THIS IS A COMPARISON OF SPRING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GROUNDWATER LEVELS SO. THE CONCLUSION OF THE LOVE THAT. STRAIGHT AFTER WE HAD A COUPLE OF THOSE REALLY WENT YEARS IN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. SO SPRING TWENTY EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO SPRING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS- ALL OF THAT RED AND ORANGE TRIANGLES AND BARS UP IN THE CORNER. OUR GROUNDWATER BASINS THAT DECLINES TO THE ROUND WATER LEVELS DROPPED BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. SO IT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD ABOUT 30% OF THESE MONITORING WELLS SHOWED LOWER LEVELS BUT- BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE JUST OVER THAT SHORT. AND WE'RE ALREADY DO YOU KNOW JUST TWO YEARS IN THE DISTRAUGHT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING DECLINES IN THE GROUNDWATER LEVELS. AND THIS WAS FROM THE SPRING SO IT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE USAGE THAT HAPPENED IN THIS VERY HOT SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEXT- SET OF READINGS WILL. WILL SHOW EVEN FURTHER DECLINES. AT ONE POINT TO JUST MAKE IS THE- AND I THIS WAS IN THE QUITE A BIT SO YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS. AT LEAST DURING THE SUMMER THE WATER CONDITIONS IN SOME CALIFORNIA ARE ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER THAN IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WHICH- MIGHT SEEM SURPRISING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MOST OF OUR PRECIPITATION ACTUALLY FALLS IN THE NORTH SO WHY WAS IT BETTER IN THE SOUTH COMPARED TO THE NORTH. SH I THINK PART OF THE STORY THERE WAS RELATED TO THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT WE STOP FROM PROPOSITION ONE. A FEW YEARSAGO THERE THERE HAD BEEN A LIST HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SPENDING A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BOTH ALTERNATIVE WATER SUPPLIES- LIKE WATER RECYCLING AT AND ALSO STORAGE. AND SO BAD THEY THEY HAD BETTER WATER WATER SUPPLIES ON HAND THAT IN IN THE SUMMER. THAT STARTED CHANGING AND THE LONGER THAT THE DRY PERIOD WAS GOING ALONG. AGAIN JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS RECENT DROUGHT WE ARE SEEING HOUSEHOLDWATER SHORTAGES AGAIN SO THAT'S WHAT THIS GRAPH SHOWS. THESE ARE HOUSEHOLD WATER SHORTAGES REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. SO YOU CAN HAVE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THIS IS PROBABLY UNDER COUNTING BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY CALLS OF THAT STATE TO TELL THEM. WHEN THEY'RE WELL GOES DRY. BUT BUT THIS REFLECTS THE REPORTED SHOULD THAT REPORTING THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID GET SO I YOU CAN SEE THE HIGH SPIKES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. OR SIXTEEN. AND THEN NOT SO MANY SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWENTY AND THEN NOW IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE SEEING. A LOT MORE REPORTS OF CASH FAST DRY WELLS BEGAN HOUSEHOLD SHORTAGES- ALL SEEN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE SEVERE WILDFIRES THAT BREAKING RECORDS AGAIN THIS SUMMER FROM DRY CONDITIONS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE DROUGHT. AND THEN AGAIN REALLY HIGH FISH MORTALITY I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS FOCUSED ON HUMAN IMPACTS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE HEALTH OF THE ECOSYSTEMS- AND FOOD WEBS. CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF HUMANS AS WELL BUT ALSO OF COURSE THE HUMANS WHO WORK IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FOR HIM YOU KNOW SALMON ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CULTURAL RESOURCE FOR EXAMPLE- CERTAINLY AFFECTIVE BI- THE HEALTH OF OR ECOSYSTEMS AND NATIVE FISH SPECIES AS WELL. SO WHY DID THE DRIVER GET SO BAD SO QUICKLY. TEMPERATURES ARE A BIG PART OF IT WE BROKE RECORDS THIS SUMMER FOR THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURES FOR JUNE JULY AND AUGUST ON ON RECORD. AND THAT CERTAINLY HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO WHY THINGS GOT SO DRY YOU KNOW OUR OUR SNOW PACK IN FEBRUARY ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT BAD IT WASN'T THAT DRY MATTER OR THAT LITTLE COMPARED TO. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. BUT WHEN THAT SNOW MELTED IT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO A RESERVOIR ST THAT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT THE SOILS WERE SO DRY. THE SNOW MELTED INTO THE SOIL AND DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE RESERVOIR SO. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DOES FORECASTS OF HOW MUCH WATER THERE EXPECTING WILL COME IN AND THEY OVER ESTIMATED THAT THE RAN OFF. IN THAT- SACRAMENTO BASIN WAS LIKE BY 65% AND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN IN TULARE LAKE LIKE 45% SO. REALLY OVER ESTIMATED. AT HOW MUCH WATER WE WOULD GET FROM THAT SNOW BACK- BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE IT WOULD SOAK INTO THE SOIL THAT WAY SO. SO IT GOT BAD REALLY QUICKLY AND IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THOSE TEMPERATURES- THE OTHER PART OF THE STORY I THINK THAT'S WHY IT GOT SO BAD SO QUICKLY IS RELATED TO GROUNDWATER SO- THIS IS THE SAME PICTURE THAT WE SAW EARLIER BUT THIS IS A TEN YEAR COMPARISON INSTEAD OF A THREE YEAR COMPARISON SO LOOKS AT SPRING TWENTY ELEVEN. COMPARED TO SPRING TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU CAN SEE A LOT MORE RED AND ORANGE HERE. SO THIS IS WHAT THIS IS SHOWING IS THAT FROM BEFORE THE LAST DROUGHT. TEN NOW ON NET. WE ARE THE GROUND WATER LEVELS ARE BELOW- WHAT WHAT THEY WERE. SO OLD THAT THE ORANGE BARS ARE DROPPED BY AT LEAST. FIVE FEET AND THE RED IS DROP BY AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE FEET. SO MONITORING WELLS HAVE SHOWN DECLINE. SINCE THE LAST STRAW. SO KIND OF WE INTO DROUGHT WITH THE DEFICIT IS WHAT THIS IS SAYING AND THEN AND HADN'T FULLY RECOVERED OR- NOT TO GO BACK TO THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND DEPEND ON IT SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE STORY OF WHY THINGS GOT SO BAD. SO QUICKLY IS OUR GROUND WATER LEVELS WERE ALREADY DEPLETED. SO NOW TIME FOR SOME GOOD NEWS- IN SWITCH SWITCHING TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE ABOUT THIS THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THAT YEAH MOST RECENT BUDGET PACKAGE PASSED THIS SUMMER AND THEN INTO SEPTEMBER. THE DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE BUDGET PACKAGE AS YOU CAN SEE THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE LEVEL AS WELL AS INTENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE COMING TWO YEARS THAT STILL NEED TO BE APPROPRIATED BUT THERE'S INTENT TO PROVIDE THAT. FOR A VARIETY OF WATER- SUCH A LAG RESILIENCE DROUGHT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. THE IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSE YOU CAN SEE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. PART OF THAT IS FOR THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROVIDING BOTTLED WATER OR TANKS OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT- BUT ALSO A NEW COMMUNITY WATER PROGRAM THAT I THINK THE SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS- MISS MESSER FROM D. W. R. WE'LL TALK ABOUT. THAT PROGRAM. A LOT OF INVESTMENT FOR DRINKING WATER AS YOU CAN SEE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. I THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THIS FINDING IS THAT IT'S MOSTLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND NEARLY ALL OF IT IS FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS DIFFERENT. FROM WHAT THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY PROVIDED BOND FUNDING. SO THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING INTEREST SO IT'S- IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE BUT ALSO OFFERS A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW THE FUNDS CAN BE USED BECAUSE BOND FUNDS TYPICALLY ARE LIMITED TO. CAPITAL OUTLAY INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TYPE PROJECTS IN HERE THERE'S A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY CAN BE USED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT CAN BE USED FOR- YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND KIND OF HELPING HELPING PEOPLE. RESOLVE WHATEVER THE ISSUES ARE RATHER THAN JUST BUILDING STUFF SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD NEWS THAT WE HAD STATE SURPLUS THAT ALLOWED FOR THIS TYPE. I ALSO FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA- AND HELPING DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS TO SUPPORT ABOUT THAT GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS. THERE WAS ALSO SOME LEGISLATION- THIS YEAR TO HELP WITH IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSE I THINK I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THESE AS- WAYS TO EXPEDITE PROJECTS IN SPEED UP PROCESS SEES. SO NORMALLY WHEN WE'RE ALLOCATING STATE FUNDS IT'S OFTEN THREE- COMPETITIVE GRANT PROJECTS OUR CURRENT CREDIT COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS SEES AND SEVERAL LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO PUT TOGETHER GRANT APPLICATIONS AND MAYBE COME UP WITH MATCHING FUNDS AND IT'S A MUCH LONGER PROCESS SO. THIS LEGISLATION ALLOWS THE STATE TO PROVIDE DIRECT EXPENDITURES IF THE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT TOGETHER A GRANT APPLICATION YOU DON'T NEED TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST OTHERS THE STATE WILL COME IN AND HELP FIX THAT SO. AGAIN THAT'S EXPEDITING FOR MORE OF THAT EMERGENCY CONDITIONS AND THEN SIMILARLY IT'S OFTEN USUALLY STATE PROGRAMS ARE SET UP ON A REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. WHICH CAN BE HARD FOR ESPECIALLY SMALL LOCAL AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH ALL THE UP FRONT CASH TO UNDERTAKE A PROJECT AND WAIT FOR STATE REIMBURSEMENT SO- THIS LEGISLATION ALLOWED FOR THE EMERGENCY DROUGHT PROJECTS THAT- UP 225% OF IT CAN. JUST BE FRONTED MEDIA. LEE WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR REIMBURSEMENT HIS MASTER THAT SHE GETS TO DO THE REALLY GOOD NEWS OF. UPDATING ON CURRENT CONDITIONS BUT- I GUESS. I GUESS TALK ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR WATER SO THAT SOME GOOD. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. PANELIST FOR THE SECTION AND THAT'S- CINDY MASTERED THE LEAD DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AS MY FELLOW PANELISTS SAID I'M GONNA TRY AND SHARE MY SCREEN AND THAT IS THE SCARIEST PART SO. LET ME SEE I SEE IT HERE. JUST. ALL RIGHT WELL I'M GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR MELINDA BUSH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF A PANEL OF THIS AFTERNOON AND TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT CURRENT WATER CONDITIONS AND RELATED DROUGHT CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I DID WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRAPHIC THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT BUT I ALSO THINK MOST ELDERS ALSO CONFIDED THAT IN HER PRESENTATION THAT'S THE GRAPHIC THAT SHOWS DROUGHT SEVERITY THROUGH THE ENTIRE STATE OF THAT PARTICULAR ILLUSTRATION REALLY JUMPED OUT FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IT SO EFFECTIVELY SHOWS IS. THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO WHERE SHE'S CURRENTLY IN OUR STATE THAT IS UNTOUCHED BY DROUGHT THE DEGREES OF SEVERITY MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT EVERY PORTION OF THE STATE IS DEFINITELY AFFECTED IN SOME WAY THIS AFTERNOON OR A COUPLE DIFFERENT AREAS- I WANT TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON HYDROLOGIC AND WATER SUPPLY CONDITIONS AS THEY CURRENTLY STAND. AND I THINK I WILL PROBABLY DUPLICATE A LITTLE BIT- WITH MY FELLOW PANELISTS BUT I WON'T DWELL ON ON SOME OF THOSE POINTS- JUST. WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT. ITEMS THAT ARE PROBABLY WORTH REPEATING AS I GO THROUGH MY CREATION TATIAN- I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE STATE'S APPROACH- SPECIFICALLY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AS WE MANAGE. THE STATE WATER PROJECT. OF OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CURRENT WATER SUPPLIES AS WE MOVE INTO THIS NEW WATER YEAR. STARTED ON OCTOBER FIRST SO WE'RE NOT TERRIBLY FAR INTO THE WATER YOU'RE JUST YET- AND WE ARE ENTERING WHAT I KNOW WE ALL HOPE WILL BE THE WEIRDEST PART. PORTION SORRY OF THE WATER HERE SO STARTING WITH THIS MONTH OF DECEMBER AND MOVING INTO. JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THAT IS TRADITIONALLY THE WETTEST PORTION OF OUR WATER HERE. AND SO I KNOW WE ARE ALL. ROSS THIS WEEK HAS. A GREAT AT HOME FOR GETTING SOME PRECIPITATION MUCH NEEDED SNOW- BUT WE ARE WE DO STILL HAVE MONTHS AHEAD OF US THAT BRING. HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THIS TYPE OF WEATHER WILL PERSIST THROUGH WALMART- SO WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HOW WE ENTERED THIS WATER YEAR IN OUR APPROACH TO. MANAGING SUPPLIES. AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED TO JUST HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL EFFORTS. ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES FOR THE STATE IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING. AND THESE ARE MEANT TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES LOCAL WATER SUPPLIERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE ROUGHLY THESE ACTIVITIES FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DATA. PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND PROVIDING COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION SERVICE ARM AND JUST BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF FUN RITUALS. SOME OF THE INFORMATION SHE PROVIDED. THESE INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS. FALL INTO BOTH- A PREVIOUS THE PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTED. AND THOSE ACTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THE LAST ROUTE BUT WE'RE ALSO IN AND THAT IS KIND OF A POSITIVE PART OF MY PRESENTATION WERE ALSO- CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING. ACTIVITIES THAT CAME OUT OF THE RECENTLY PASSED STATE BUDGET- SO- JUST KIND OF TOUCH UPON BOTH OF THOSE TYPE OF AREA. HOME WHEN WE MOVED INTO WATER CONDITIONS SO- FOR CONTEXT AND AGAIN TO MAYBE ECHO WHAT MY TROUBLE PANELIST KEYED UP- WE ARE WE HAVE STARTED THIS WATER YEAR WITH HISTORIC LOW LEVELS OF WATER STORED IN OUR RESERVOIRS BUT ALSO OUR GROUNDWATER AND BOXERS AND THIS IS IN LARGE PART TO COMING OFF OF A TWO YEAR PERIODS WILL LAST YOU CONSECUTIVE YEARS COMBINED WHERE THE SECOND DRIEST IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS SO WE HAVE ENTERED THIS WATER YEAR WITH THE DEFICIT- AND A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT LIES AHEAD. SO BASED ON THAT WE ARE APPROACHING THE YEAR AND MANAGING CURRENT OUR SUPPLIES IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THATJUST A SECOND- AS I MENTIONED WE ARE. CAN OF ENTERING THE CAP KELAPA WEATHER MONTHS- SO WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN AND FEBRUARY. THANKS FOR THE REST OF THE WATER HERE AND HOW WE MANAGE SUPPLIES MOVING THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORLD TWENTY TWO. SO CURRENT CONDITIONS THAT WAS STRAIGHT THE VERY ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER CONDITIONS AT A LOCAL LEVEL- AND THE GRAPHIC THAT I'M SHOWING RIGHT NOW OUR THE SLIDE THAT I'M SHOWING IS MEANT TO ILLUSTRATE THAT VERY ABILITY. SO ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW- IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE OVER THE LAST ROUGHLY TWO MONTHS. AND IN TERMS OF PERCENT OF AVERAGE PRECIPITATION WE ARE DOING WELL WE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND 50% OF AVERAGE AGAIN THIS IS KIND OF A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. IN TERMS OF AVERAGE PRECIPITATION. BUT AS YOU MOVE FURTHER SOUTH- DOWN THE STATE WILL GET THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE STATE. THEY'RE AT A LOWER AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF PRECIPITATION AND YOU MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE. SOME OF THOSE WATERSHEDS OR ONLY AT ABOUT 4250% OF AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SO VERY ABILITY VERY KEY TO THE TO THE STAGE AND THEN AGAIN THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CONDITIONS THAT LIE AHEAD OF US- SORRY. ALL BACK P FOR JUST A SECOND HERE- I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELCOMING OF THIS WEEK'S STORMS ARE MUCH NEEDED SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS MUCH NEEDED PRECIPITATION IN PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHAT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL THAT THE STORMS ARE BY NO MEANS A DROUGHT BUSTER WE WILL NEED MANY MORE OF THESE TYPES OF STORMS EVENTS THROUGH THE SEASON TO REALLY MOVE US PAST DIRE CONDITIONS THAT WE TRIED- OURSELVES AND- HAVE FOUND OURSELVES AND AS WE ENTER THE LAST. LAST PART OF THIS YEAR. OUR FORECASTS AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- ABOUT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION ON THIS YEAR'S WEATHER FORECASTS. DO YOU SUGGEST TO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. COULD RECEIVE ABOVE AVERAGE PRECIPITATION FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. BUT THEY'RE ALSO SHOWING THE POTENTIAL THAT THIS PRECIPITATION DROPS OFF OVER THE REST OF THAT SEASON SO SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY. AND OBVIOUSLY WILL BE FACTORING INTO OUR DECISIONS AROUND WATER ALLOCATION WATER STORAGE PRESERVATION AS WE MOVE INTO THE SPRING MONTHS. SEVERAL SWITCHING GEARS I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH UPON VERY BRIEFLY WATER STORAGE I THINK THIS IS- AN ILLUSTRATION THAT IS SIMILAR AND IN SOME WAYS TO THE GRAPHIC THAT. RACHEL SHOWED EARLIER- WHAT THIS ILLUSTRATION IS MEANT TO SHOW YOU IS THAT LOOKING AT ALL OF THE MAJOR WATER STORAGE RESERVOIRS WITHIN THE STATE WHAT YOU QUICKLY NOTICE IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WELL BELOW AVERAGE- WELL BELOW AVERAGE HISTORICAL ALL CAPACITY. IN THEIR CURRENT CAPACITIES ARE VERY LOW OF THE TWO THAT I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. OR LAKE OR A BILL WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF THE CRAFT IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE YOU'LL SEE AS OF DECEMBER FOURTEENTH SO JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO. MAKE YOUR BILL WAS ABOUT. 31% OF ITS CAPACITY. AND OTHER. AND DRAW YOUR TO THE SAINT LOUIS RESERVOIR MIDDLE OF THE STATE THE CHART IS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. AND AS OF A COUPLE DAYS AGO THAT RESERVOIRS ABOUT 24% OF CAPACITY SO. SO AS I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A CODE- EACH OTHER WE HAVE STARTED THIS YEAR WAS A GREAT DEFICIT IN TERMS OF THE WATER WE HAVE AVAILABLE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE COVER SLIDE TO MY PRESENTATION IS SAM WAS RESERVOIR I THINK A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS AND JUST LOOKING AT THAT YOU CAN. SEE THAT INDEED 24% MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WATER LEVELS. ALONG SURE. I WOULD ALSO JUST KNOWN SUMMARY THAT STATEWIDE RESERVOIR STORAGE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER SO JUST LAST MONTH WHAT'S THAT 66% OF AVERAGE. AND THAT'S IN COMPARISON 287% OF AVERAGE FOR THIS SAME TIME LAST YEAR SO AGAIN THE TREND HAS BEEN DOWNWARD AGAIN WE HAVE STARTED THIS YEAR WITH MUCH LESS WATER. AND I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH AT THIS POINT ON GROUNDWATER LEVELS I THINK WE HAVE MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS ALSO ANOTHER PART OF THE EQUATION COMING INTO THIS WATER YEAR. OVER THE LAST BULLET PAST SUMMER WE DID OBSERVE DRAMATIC DROPS IN GROUNDWATER LEVELS ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THIS REFLECTS INCREASES IN PUMPING AS WATER USERS IN THESE AREAS A LITTLE OR NO SURFACE WATER ALLOCATIONS LAST YEAR. SO FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT OVER THIS LAST YEAR OR ALLOCATIONS WILL ROLL AROUND FIVE PERCENT. SIR WATER USERS NEEDED TO TURN TO OTHER SOURCES- COUPLE MET IN AND TO ADDRESS THE WATER DEMANDS THAT THEY HAD. SO. SORRY I'M GONNA BACK UP JUST A MINUTE HERE I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MANAGING WATER SUPPLY SO AGAIN THIS IS FROM THE STATE WATER PERSPECTIVE. AS WE BEGIN A WET SEASON AS WE SAID WITH EXTREMELY CHALLENGING WATER SUPPLY CONDITIONS STATE WATER PROJECT INITIALLY WILL REALLY ONLY PLANNING TO DELIVER MINIMUM RESIDENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY WATER NEEDS SO I'M SURE MANY OF YOU SAW IN THE MEDIA ON DECEMBER FIRST WE DID OUR INITIAL STATE WATER PROJECT ALLOCATION AND THAT WHAT OUR ALLOCATION WAS 0% WE ARE STILL PROVIDING WATER TO SOME OF OUR STATE WATER CONTRACTORS FOR HUMAN HEALTH HOME GYM AND HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS. BUT THE ALLOCATION IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE IS THE LOWEST WE HAVE NOT HAD A 0% ALLOCATION. BERRY BEGINNING IN NINETEEN NINETY SO IT IS- AND DID A VERY HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR OUR PROCESS- AS WE- BEING INTO FURTHER INTO THE WET SEASON WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR WATER AGENCIES TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS THAT THEY MAY HAVE IN THEIR SERVICE AREAS CURRENTLY WE HAVE EIGHT OF OUR STATE WATER CONTRACTORS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH SHOE PROVIDE. US SOME WATER FOR THOSE TYPES OF NEEDS- TO HELP THEM MEET THOSE COMMITMENTS AND DELIVER WATER FOR AGAIN HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS SERVICES DOMESTIC USE USE FOR SANITATION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION. WE ARE ALSO COORDINATING WITH U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WHO IS IN CHARGE OF OPERATING THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. H. YOU ARE WORKING WITH THEIR MUNICIPAL WATER CONTRACTORS IN THEIR SERVICE AREAS TO IDENTIFY SIMILAR. CRITICAL RESIDENTIAL. AND HEALTH INSURANCE SAFETY NEEDS TOGETHER WERE ARE LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WORKING WITH OUR WATER CONTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY WHO'S MOST AT NEED AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT AS I MENTIONED WERE WERE ERRING ON THE SIDE OF BEING VERY CONSERVATIVE THIS EARLY IN THE WATER YEAR BASED ON STARTING WITH SUCH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF WATER IN STORAGE. THERE ARE CERTAIN CRITICAL AREAS THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ADMISSIONS. HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS ONE THING I WOULD HAVE A LINK TO THIS JUST MAYBE FOR SOME CONTEXT TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT BE SEEN THROUGH THE MEDIA- READING OR HEARING ABOUT NO OTHER PLACES. IS THAT PART OF- BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE WATER AND WATER QUALITY THAT IS SAFE FOR DRINKING WATER AND DOMESTIC USE- WE NEED TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY IN THE DELTA REGION. SO ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND THAT WE DID AGAIN FOR THIS DROUGHT IS TO INSTALL. A ROCKET TEMPORARY WALK. DELTA BUT IT'S- IS USED REPEL- SALT WATER WORKS SALTIER WATER COMING IN FROM THE OCEAN AND THE BABY INTO THE DELTA. AND PRESERVING THE FRESH WATER THAT IS FLOWING. THROUGH THE DELTA REGION SO THAT'S OUR TEMPORARY BARRIER IT IS STAYING IN PLACE FOR THE MOMENT. BUT WE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE EVALUATING THE NEED FOR THAT YOUR POTENTIALLY OTHER BARRIERS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE HYDROLOGY GETS US AS WE MOVE INTO THE SPRING. ANOTHER CATEGORY OF CRITICAL NEED THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE APPROACHING WHAT WATER MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS OF STATE WATER PROJECT. IS WATER NEEDED FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES OUR I KNOW THAT RACHEL TALKED ABOUT- THAT NEED FOR FISHERIES- WE'VE ALSO BEEN HELPING IN DIFFERENT WAYS WITH SOME OF THE CITRIX Y. WAY. EFFORTS TO PRESERVE NATIONAL WET AREAS FOR BIRDS THAT ARE MIGRATING THROUGH THE STATE. SO THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL AREA THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WATER OPERATIONS. OVERALL OUR- ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS IS TO PRESERVE STORAGE IN OUR IN THE RESERVOIRS ARE KEY RESERVOIRS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE WILL BRING. AND SO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE GRAPHIC I HAVE UP NOW AND AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE STARTING AT LOWER LEVELS. REALLY TRYING TO PRESERVE THOSE TO GET US THROUGH THE YEAR- AND HOPING THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE STORMS LIKE WE DO THIS WEEK HOME I THINK REALLY MAYBE GOING BACK TO THE OCTOBER THE BIG ATMOSPHERIC RIVER AND THEY CAME THROUGH THE STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT DID THAT WILL BE HELPFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS TO. TUNE HIDE- ADDITIONAL MOISTURE INTO THE SOIL SO TO BUILD THE SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT THAT SORT OF REALLY FAST AND FURIOUS AND BAD EVENT THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW THIS LAST YEAR WHERE THE SOILS WERE BONE DRY DRY AND THE WATER THAT WE GOT WAS JUST IMMEDIATELY SUCKED UP INTO ONE SO THAT. HELPS PUT US ON A LITTLE BETTER FOOTING- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY MANAGING TO SHOOT THESE LOW LEVELS. AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I THINK I PROBABLY SAID IT A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HYDROLOGY WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL CLIMATE INDUCED IMPACTS LIKE WARMER TEMPERATURES. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT REALLY EXASPERATED THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THIS LAST YEAR SO WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW OUR TEMPERATURES AIR TEMPERATURES LOOKING NORMAL QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR THIS MONTH FOR JANUARY. FOR FEBRUARY- AND KIND OF PUT ALL OF THIS AND- TO. AND AS THE HYDRO. OF FOR IT AS WE HAVE WE'RE NOT COMING IN. EACH THE RESERVOIRS ARE WE SEE THE TREND MAY BE MOVING UP IN TERMS OF STORAGE WE WILL BE ADJUSTING ALLOCATION. OF WATER TO OUR CONTRACTORS- HOPING THAT YOU KNOW WE CANNOT SUPPLY WATER FOR PURPOSES. IN ADDITION TO JUST THAT YOU WILL HELP HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY MEETINGS- BUT IT WILL BE A VERY DYNAMIC PROCESS AND AGAIN WE WILL HAVE TO ADJUST YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS ON A DAILY WEEKLY MONTHLY BASIS. I'M AN ADJUSTING OUR DECISIONS AS WE GO THROUGH. THIS GO THROUGH THE SEASON AND GO THROUGH OUR PROCESS SEES. SO NOW WITH. THE NEXT LIGHT ONLY HAVE FIVE SLIDES ARE GOING TO MAKE A LAST I GUESS- BUT JUST AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED GROUNDWATER. VERY CRUCIAL RESOURCE DURING DROUGHTS CRITICAL RESOURCE DURING ALL TIMES BUT ESPECIALLY DURING DROUGHT CONDITIONS- AND WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME MOVING SORRY MOVING KIND OF INSURE AREAS OF ASSISTANCE THAT THE STATE IS PROVIDING SEVERAL THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF. INFORMATION AND DATA SYSTEMS- WE JUST RECENTLY RELEASED OUR GROUND STATEWIDE GROUNDWATER REPORT THAT SUMMARIZES GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS. ON THE GROUND WATER. RESOURCES ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE. PART OF THIS. WE NEED WATCHED THIS NEW TOOL HELLO THE GROUNDWATER WHAT HAPPENED SORRY CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER LIKE TO- WE ARE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOOL IT'S WEB BASED SO ANYBODY CAN ACCESS IT IT'S VERY USER FRIENDLY IT CONTAINS A LOT OF CRITICAL BROWN WATER RELATED DATA AND INFORMATION. THAT USERS CAN CUSTOMIZE AND THEN VISUALIZE THE EXAMPLES I HAVE HERE AND USED TO HELP IN GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS THEY MAY HAVE SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE TODAY YOU CAN ACCESS IT THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. IF YOU GO TO DETER YOUR WEBSITE TO THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PAGE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THIS TOOL- JUST WANTED TO MENTION IN LOOKING AT THE SLIDE THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE TOOL. AND I THINK IT IS NEAR SOME OF THE INFORMATION WE'VE ALREADY HEARD. ALL THE- GRAPHIC ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS CURRENT WATER LEVELS IN WELLS SO THIS GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW- FROM OUR MONITORING WELLS WHAT A WHAT WHAT DO WATER LEVELS LOOK LIKE. SO THAT YOU CAN SEE 74% OF THE WALLS THAT WE MONITOR THE LITTLE NORMAL SO THE WATER LEVELS ARE LOW. ABOUT 17% OR IN THE NORMAL RANGE AT 9% OR ABOVE NORMAL. ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE YOU CAN TAKE THAT SAME INFORMATION AND LOOK FOR TRENDS SO THIS IS ABOUT A TWENTY YEAR. CYCLE THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THE SAME INFORMATION JUST JUST A SEAT OVER TIME WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF WATER LEVELS IN WELLS. AND YOU CAN SEE IT FOLLOWS SOMEWHAT THE SAME PATTERN I'M A LITTLE LESS SEVERE OVER TIME WITH 58% OF THOSE WALLS HAVING A DECREASE IN WATER LEVEL. THIRTY SIX REMAINING STABLE AT ABOUT 6% SHOWING AN INCREASE IN WATER LEVEL. SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT THIS TOOL AND AGAIN WERE VERY EXCITED AND I THINK IT. WILL BE VERY HELPFUL. IN TERMS FOR COMMUNITIES FOR GSA'S FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WATER SUPPLIERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION- JUST AT HAND. AS THEY NEED TO LOOK AT AND ADDRESS DIFFERENT. QUESTIONS AND DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. SO NOW- WANTED TO SWITCH GEARS AGAINST YOU MORE OF THE CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT I MUST SAY WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO BE A PART OF VERY HAPPY THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE. SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET- THERE. YOU HAVE YOU ARE WAS MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR- PROVIDING SMALL COMMUNITY TRAVEL SH AND SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FIVE ROUNDS OF FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO THE TOTAL ABOUT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS IS FOR FORTY EIGHT PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS SMALL COMMUNITY DROUGHT WEEKS- IN FACT ENOUGH PENDING APPLICATIONS IN THIS PROGRAM TO COMMIT THE REMAINING NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THIS FISCAL YEAR. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL BE PRIORITIZING EMERGENCY DROUGHT RESPONSE PROJECTS IN TROUBLE PROJECTS. SO THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES REPLACE THINGS LIKE LEAKING- SHALE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS STRUCTURE DRILLING NEW WELLS IS NEEDED FOR PROVIDING BULK AND BOTTLED WATER FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE IN MOST NEED OF BEING ABLE TO GET. DRINKING WATER A DOMESTIC USE WATER AND SO ON. SO LOOKING AT THE GRAPHICS I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE DIFFERENT COLORED CIRCLES ARE THE FIVE PHASES OF THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE. TO GET OUT THE DOOR IF YOU WILL- THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT GO WITH THOSE- YOU CAN SEE THE DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE A WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND SO FAR. I WOULD NOTE THERE ORANGE ANY DOTS IN THE VERY SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE- AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE IN COORDINATION WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WHO ALSO RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THIS LAST STATE BUDGET ROUNDED WHO ARE ALSO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF. PROJECTS THAT WORK WITH SMALL COMMUNITIES AND HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR THEIR DRINKING WATER ISSUES WATER QUALITY ISSUES THEY HAVE BEEN FOCUSING A LOT OF THEIR EFFORTS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE SO IN ORDER TO NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS. BUT TO BE COORDINATED IF YOU WERE TO PUT THEIR PROJECTS INTO THIS GRAPHIC YOU WOULD SEE MORE JOBS IN. IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF STATE SO. ONE AND THEN MY LAST SLIDE IS ON THE- URBAN MALL BENEFIT DROP GRANTS PROGRAM AGAIN THIS IS FUNDING THAT IS. WAS MADE AVAILABLE WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET- D. W. R. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS GRANT PROGRAMS AND GETTING THESE AWARDS OUT. WE HAVE SO FAR TO FUNDING PHASES ONE THAT WERE JUST ABOUT TO WRAP UP IN ANOTHER ONE THAT WE'RE IN MID PROCESS WITH. THERE'S A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR THESE GRANT AWARDS WE HAVE DONE A SET ASIDE FOR UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND TRIBAL PROJECTS. TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO OUR FIRST PHASE HI THESE GRANT AWARDS WILL BE RELEASED IN LATE DECEMBER SO JUST AROUND THE CORNER- THESE WERE GRANTS THAT IN APPLICATIONS RECEIVED IN MID NOVEMBER WE REVIEWED THEM AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO. MAKE THOSE AWARDS THE SECOND PHASE WE HAVE OPEN NOW- IT'S CURRENTLY OPEN THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL REVIEW THOSE GRANT APPLICATIONS AND ANTICIPATE MAKING AWARDS- BY MARCH OF NEXT YEAR SO FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THIS FLIGHT JUST GIVES YOU THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE URBAN COMMUNITY FUND AND THE MULTI BENEFIT- PROJECT FUND. SO AGAIN THESE ARE PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO OTHER PROJECTS BUT FOR THE URBAN COMMUNITIES AND FOR MULTI BENEFITS DROP PROJECTS THAT HELP- ADDRESS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES. OF DRUG RELATED IMPACTS. SO TO LAST POINT AND THEN I WILL BE I'M AND I WANT TO JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE COMMUNICATION COORDINATION ASSISTANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON. AGAIN NOT ALWAYS BY YOURSELF DEFINITELY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHERS. FIRST ONE I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT WE WILL BE SHORTLY VERY SHORTLY RELEASING A SET OF DRINKING WATER WELL CONSOLES AND STRATEGIES. RIGHT A FRAMEWORK FOR GUIDING STATE ACTIONS IN ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM SUCH AS THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE STATE BOARD'S SAVER PROGRAM. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES RECOGNIZE IMPORTANCE OF GROUNDWATER AS A DRINKING WATER SOURCE FOR PRIVATE WELLS AND PUBLIC SMALL PUBLIC SYSTEMS SO THIS IS A SET OF PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES THAT HELP FURTHER INTEGRATE THE STATE AND OUR ACTIONS WERE ADMINISTRATION. OF VARIOUS EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES WITH THE LOCALS NON NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS GSK'S AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES SO THESE ARE MEANT TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. TO BUILD MORE RESILIENCE- SPACE A DRINK IT FOR SMALL WORLD PRIVATE WELLS AND SMALL SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE DRINKING WATER. ARND ARM THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS ON OUTREACH SO- AS YOU ALL MAY REMEMBER WE UTILIZED SAVE OUR WATER- OUTREACH CAMPAIGN WE UTILIZE THIS DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WE ARE UTILIZING IT AGAIN WE HAVE GREAT SUCCESS WITH IT LASKO AROUND. SO WE ARE ONCE AGAIN- USING THE SAME OR WATER AFTER PLATFORM. IF YOU WILL RECALL IT'S MEANT TO REALLY- IT'S TARGETED AT RESIDENTIAL WATER USERS SO IT'S MENTOR PROVIDES REALLY SIMPLE WAYS THAT RESIDENTIAL RESIDENTS CAN. REDUCE THEIR WATER USE WITHIN OUR HOUSE AROUND THE HOUSE WAYS TO KINDERGARTEN GOING- BUT WITH LESS WATER. SO WE HAVEN'T DONE A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENTS TODAY WE WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO GET MESSAGING OUT WE ARE DOING THIS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WE ARE TARGETING DIFFERENT TYPES OF MARKETS I'M IN COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZING THAT PRIORITIES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT INFORMATION NEEDS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. SO WILL BE MORE TO COME ON THAT AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEW YEAR BUT THAT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE- IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION THAT THE STATE IS APPROACHING AGAIN. A STATEWIDE. USING THIS TOOL TO ACHIEVE THAT. SO THINK THAT I AM- MY PRESENT AND HAPPY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS WORLD THE TIME IS RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AT THIS MOMENT I WILL OPEN UP- THIS PART OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE PROVIDE FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SO WHEN IT JUST AFRAID OF SUNDERLAND SEARCHES QUESTIONS FOR THE- TWO SPEAKERS. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO I WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS FOR THE INFORMATION THERE SAID BREADTH OF INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARED SOME OF WHICH YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL AWARE OF- BUT A LITTLE MORE DETAIL- ON THOSE WHICH I APPRECIATE BUT WE TALK A LOT. ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF. NOT HAVING ENOUGH WATER BUT I WONDER IF SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THIS VERY SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH IS. WHAT WOULD THE COST BE. IF WE WERE TO- BUILD THE. RESERVOIRS IN AND EVERYTHING WE WOULD NEED TO CONSERVE MORE WATER FOR CALIFORNIANS WHAT WOULD THAT COST BE IF WE WERE TO DO THAT SO THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THE SEVERE DROUGHT YEARS. CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE ENSURED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE WATER THAT THEY NEED CAN ANYONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME BY ANY CHANCE. THIS IS RACHEL EVANS WITH THE LA OUT- I THINK THE INFORMATION AND I DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEND IT THAT THAT WE HAVE IS ESTIMATED COSTS OF THE PROPOSED. KIND OF RESERVOIRS AND- AND GROUNDWATER PROPOSALS FOR THE PROPOSITION ONE WATER STORAGE FUNDING. SO WE HAVE COST ESTIMATES FOR THAT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO KIND OF ADDRESS ALL CALIFORNIA'S WATER NEEDS AND THAT IS NOT A NUMBER I'VE SEEN IT NOW OR AN ESTIMATE THAT I'VE SEEN- BUT WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE ESTIMATES FOR. PROPOSED THAT TOTAL COST OF SOME OF THAT PROPOSED WATER STORAGE PROJECTS OF THAT- AND THEN THAT WOULD BE IN THAT KIND OF- MULTIPLE BILLION DOLLAR. RANGE BUT HAPPY HAPPY I THINK YOU KNOW I WANT TO SAY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD FOR THOSE PROP ONE THE TOTAL COST OF THOSE PROPOSED PROP ONE STORAGE PROJECTS BEAT THEIR EIGHT OF THEM- BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE WITH MORE SPECIFIC THAT THAT'S- KIND OF THE- THE BEST ESTIMATE I HAVE I DON'T KNOW IF MISS MESSER. HAS HAS MORE TO OFFER. I'M NOW MUCH MORE IN I WOULD I THINK THOSE ARE PROBABLY OUR BEST AND GIVE THEY GIVE US THE BEST IDEA OF WHAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS COST AND- YOU KNOW THEY- WERE LIMITED. IN THE AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN INSTALL THESE KIND OF PROJECTS SO THERE'S ALSO THAT THE IDEA THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE IT. THE LEASE FOR NOW ON SORT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE. I WOULD ALSO SAY TO THERE'S THERE STORAGE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT. TO BE GAINED ON THE CONSERVATION SIDE AND I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE HARDER TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON BUT I THINK THAT'S- PART OF THE SUPER WATER CAMPAIGN- WE HAVE VARIOUS WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS- THAT. YOU KNOW WE LOOK TO THE LOCAL WATER SUPPLIERS TO IMPLEMENT WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR BROWN HAD THE ASKING FOR FIFTEEN PERCENT. ABOVE THOSE LEVELS BUT I THINK THERE ARE AREAS IN THE HOLE IN MY MIND THE WHOLE THING IS AN EQUATION SO YOU'VE GOT SUPPLY. WE'VE GOT SOME DEMAND BUT SOMEWHERE IN THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT MEASURES YOU CAN TAKE TO REALLY KIND OF. IF YOU WILL. IT. INCREASED WATER THAT WE HAVE FOLLOW UP ON SURE SOME OF OUR FOLKS WILL HAVE TO MEDICINAL PERMISSION YOU CAN PACKAGE FOR. HOURS AND PERMISSION. THANK YOU LADIES I APPRECIATE THAT IN THE END IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE CLEARLY- I JUST YOU KNOW I'M LEFT TO WONDER. IF WE WOULD JUST INVEST THE MONEY PARTICULARLY IN YEARS LIKE THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR WHERE WE HAD- A BUDGET SURPLUS AND IF WE COULD PERHAPS INVEST THAT MONEY IN. SOME OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT YOU KNOW IT WE WOULD HAVE IT IN PLACE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. THE LONGER YOU WAIT THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT. BECOMES TO DO PROJECTS LIKE THIS AND IT'S A BIG TICKET ITEM FOR SURE AND I THINK. YOU KNOW. ADMINISTRATION'S OFTENTIMES ARE HSITANT TO. KIND OF SPEND EVERYTHING IN THE ACCOUNT BUT- I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE NOT YET DONE- EVEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST OF OUR WATER USE IS NOT FROM RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS BUT REALLY FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER WE- FEED THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW WITH OUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND I THINK IT'S- WHAT TWO THIRDS. COMES FROM CALIFORNIA SO. WE CERTAINLY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST NOT ONLY IN THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS BUT IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHO DEPEND ON US. AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO. INVEST IN THE THINGS WE NEED TO INVEST IN TO MAKE SURE THAT. NOT ONLY A RESIDENTIAL USERS HAVE THE WATER THAT THEY NEED BETTER AGRICULTURAL USERS TO BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. YOU KNOW FOR SURE I MEAN THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION OUT THERE THERE'S- CERTAINLY- SOME INNOVATION THAT HAS COME FROM THE PAST AND CONTINUES TO COME FROM ISRAEL WITH RESPECT TO WATER CONSERVATION MAKING BETTER USE OF THE SUPPLY THAT WE HAVE BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT. WE CAN DO MORE WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT- FOR A FOR A NUMBER O REASONS BYE I THINK THE- THE CHAIRWOMAN PROBABLY M. SHARES. SOME OF THAT STUFF OPINION I WOULD IMAGINE- PARTICULARLY FROM THE AREA THAT SHE LIVES AND I KNOW MY SON WHO'S IN THE NAVY STATION AND LEARN MORE AND YOU KNOW I TALKED HIM THE OTHER NIGHT AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAVE TO BUY WATER WHEN THEY CAN'T DRINK THE TAP WATER WHICH IS. I MEAN THAT'S IT'S FOREIGN TO MANY PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TURN ON YOUR TAP AND DRINK THE WATER BUT THEY CANNOT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ON SOME THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THAT SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA FOR GOODNESS SAKE- SO. I THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION- THE FOURTEEN BILLION OR YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT THAT YOU ESTIMATED IT WOULD COST TO PUT WHAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- NOW I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAD THAT IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR ON THAT WE COULD HAVE SPENT BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS IN THE REGULATORY INTERESTS THAT COME INTO PLAY THAT OFTEN TIMES STOP PROJECTS LIKE THIS FROM GOING FORWARD BUT PERHAPS. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS AND POLICIES AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN BE ADJUSTED SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE WATER- ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THINKING MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S AND THANK YOU FOR ON POINTING OUT THAT. THE CHALLENGES THAT- THAT MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN AND LACK OF ACCESS TO WATER VERTICAL LAMAR PORCELAIN MARS AND MY SENATE DISTRICT AND- IT'S LIKE AS YOU SAID IT'S NOT SOME THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CALIFORNIA THE- YEAH ONE OF THE TOP FIVE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD- THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING AND THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE ARE YOU KNOW HERE TODAY AND- WORKING ON HUMAN SECURITY ISSUES BECAUSE IT'S- IT GOES BEYOND THAT TEND. AND I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- FOR OUR OUR TWO SPEAKERS- I HAVE ONE FOR OUR FIRST SPEAKER AND A COUPLE COUPLE OF OTHER. QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE THEY CAN ANSWER ON THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE THE FIRST ONE IS- ANOTHER WAS MENTION OF A LOT OF FUNDS FROM PROP ONE FOR STORAGE THAT WERE USED- AND IN PART AND YOU KNOW PLEASE FEEL FREE TO- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. KIND OF ATTRIBUTE IT TO. THE REASON WHY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PART WAS DOING WELL IN TERMS OF- NOT REALLY TAPPING A HOLE LOT INTO THE GROUND WATER. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE ALLEY- IS THE ALIENS OFFICES DO WE HAVE REALLY AN EQUITABLE. A WATER WATER STORAGE THROUGHOUT EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA WHERE COMMUNITIES. ARE LIVE- IF YOU HAVE IT QUICKLY FEEL FREE YOU ARE STRONGER I'M- YEAH I THINK ONE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT- DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE DEPEND ON DIFFERENT SOURCES OF WATER SO THERE ARE THERE IN THE TIME ALLOWED FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A GREAT DEPENDENCE ON GROUNDWATER. I'M IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUR CULTURES THAT HAVE HSTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO STORM WATER AND BE WITHDRAWN AND THEN RESELL THAT'S NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THERE ISN'T MUCH DEPENDENCE ON GROUNDWATER AT ALL IT'S ALMOST ALL IN SURFACE WATER FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN THE- SANDIEGO THERE'S NOT MUCH GROUNDWATER- PUMPING OR USAGE. THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THINKING IN THE VENTURA AREA WHERE THERE IS A QUITE A BIT OF A GROUNDWATER USAGE BUT OTHER AREAS THAT AREN'T SO AND THAT MAKES IT COMPLICATED- AND THE NEED FOR ABOVE GROUND STORAGE VERSES WITH UNDERGROUND STORAGE VARIES AROUND THE STATE- THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE TO GET A LOT OF PRECIPITATION THERE OTHER BIRDS THAT DON'T GET A LOT OF PRECIPITATION SO. WE DO NEED TO PAY A VARIED APPROACH ACROSS THE STATE ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL I AM GIVING MONEY FOR GROUNDWATER TO EVERY AREA OF THE STATE WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE DON'T HAVE GROUND WATER AND DON'T USE IT SO. I THINK THAT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF- A REGIONAL APPROACH AND ENSURING THAT EACH REGION GETS WHAT THEY NEED I WILL SAY SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS IN STORAGE ABOVE GROUND STORAGE IN PARTICULAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN FUNDED LOCALLY NOT BY THE STATE- BY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT HAS HAS SOME ABOVE GROUND- RESERVOIRS THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE REPAIRS TO PAY FOR NOT NOT AND NOT PRIMARILY THROUGH THE STATE- SO I THINK YOUR POINT SENATOR ABOUT EQUITY IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. I THINK THE POINT THAT I WOULD HIGHLY IN RESPONSE IS THAT WE CAN'T TAKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE THAT WILL INHERENTLY BE AN EQUITABLE- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF EACH REGION WHERE THEIR WATER SUPPLY COMES FROM WHAT THE REPAIRS ARE ABLE TO SUSTAIN VERSUS AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE A RATE BASE THAT CAN'T SUSTAIN IT- M. AND WHERE THEY MIGHT BE WORSE THE STATE ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO MEET OUR HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER- BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY COMPLEX PICTURE ACROSS THE STATE AS DIVERSE AS OURS. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT YES IT'S IT IS COMPLICATED AND AT DIFFERENT- IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT SOMETHING I ALWAYS SAY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT ANSWER AND. I HAVE A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS- THERE ARE A ALSO MENTION OF IRAQI HEALTH YOUR WATER FOR HUMAN HEALTH. IT REALLY INTERESTED AND KNOWING- A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT EXACTLY MEANS FOR THAT DAY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES- I ALSO ASIDE FROM. THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WHAT OTHER AENCIES IS AT D. W. ARE WORKING WITH TO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE CHALLENGES FACING DELTAS- AND OR SUBSIDENCE. ISSUES THE OTHER QUESTION WHAT MACRO CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER SYSTEM. AND THE REALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON WHETHER WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND- HUMAN FOOD INSECURITY. AND HOW DO WE DO WE NEED DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT MAJORY OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM OR CAN WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPTURE MORE WATER. MORE EFFICIENTLY FROM LIKE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS RIVERS. R. L. SO WONDERING- HOW DO WE MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE WATER SYSTEM FOR PROTECTION DURING THE WINTER MONTHS BUT ALSO FOR WATER SUPPLY FOR FARMS PEOPLE AND OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN SUMMER MONTHS. AND IF THE OTHER QUESTION ARE ALL TRIED TO STOP THERE AFTER AND WHATEVER YOU DO YOU CAN ANSWER CRATE AND WHATEVER YOU CAN'T- UP AT ANY ANY INFORMATION DUMPED ON THE ROAD IT'S UP GREATLY APPRECIATED AS WELL. BUT THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS THE ERROR THERE WAS A REPORT BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE ON THE GLOBAL OUR WATER SECURITY AND APPOINTED TO WATER AS- THE POTENTIAL USE OF THE WEAPON AND I'M I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW TO WHAT EXTENT YOUR DEPARTMENTS ARE. B. ALLELES OFFICE IS DOING TO COMBAT THINGS. THAT COULD BE USED AS AS- YOU'LL LOVE OUR AS A WEAPON OR AS LEVERAGE- ARE WE LOOKING AT WHAT MORE WE DOING IN TERMS OF WATER THEFT WHAT ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF CYBER THREATS TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE- AND OF COURSE THERE FOR TWO ALSO OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN- AT THOSE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ALSO IF YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT ANY OF THEM. FEEL FREE. TO LET ME KNOW. ALL RIGHT. I'LL JUMP IN FIRST AND I MAY NEED YOU TO REPEAT SOME OF THOSE ARE TRYING TO JOT DOWN AS MANY AS I COULD BUT- THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- HONESTLY THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION MY LAST RESPONSE BUT THIS KIND OF I THINK I COULD PULL IT. INTO INTO A DRESS BUT- SO I THINK MAYBE THE KIND OF COVER THIS IDEA OF. OPERATING THE SYSTEM HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE WATER WHEN WE HAVE THOSE WET EVENTS. THAT ALSO KIND OF FACTORS INTO SOME OF THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT- PIECES ONE THING I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I DIDN'T WAS- AS PART OF. THE STATE. BUDGET THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED. SLASH BUDGET OF PASSED- THE- STATE WAS AWARDED OVER THREE GW ARE WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS- SLATED FOR WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE CONVEYANCE OF SCIENCE PROGRAM. AND SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE- FLOOR OF THE MAJOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IN THE STATES OF THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT THAT'S PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT- THE- ST LOUIS ADULT. SORRY ST LOUIS CANAL DELTA MENDOTA CANAL IN THE CURRENT TRYING CURRENT CANAL. SO MAJOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. HAS SUFFERED FROM SUBSIDES. THE SO HE YOU CAN. AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS THE CAPACITY TO MOVE WATER HAS BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED OVER THE YEARS AND SO- THE STATE HOUSE IS PROVIDING FUNDING IT'S A CULTURE MECHANISM- SO THE STATE IS PUTTING A PORTION THE LOCALS AND THE FEDS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALSO PUTTING IN THEIR SHARE SHE- WE BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT. THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION FROM THIS BUDGET YEAR THEY'LL BE A HUNDRED MILLION MORE IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR THAT GO TOWARDS THIS PARTICULAR EFFORTS- AND WHAT THAT DOES OVER IN A COUPLE COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS IS. IT WITHIN TEN YEARS WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF WATER THAT MOVES IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS IT'S BEEN DIMINISHED BY SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE WATER BUT WE HAVE IT MOVE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. WILL HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AROUND THAT. WHAT WE'RE ALSO WILL AT THAT I THINK IS KIND OF IN CONJUNCTION TO THIS IS GROUND WATER RECHARGE SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THIS IS A BIG PART OF. FALLS UNDER THE CIGNA A BRAWL IN SOME WAYS BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY ITS OWN ENTITY I THINK UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY DROUGHT RESILIENCY. ON FLOOD MANAGEMENT IS FINDING WAYS TO TAKE WATER TAKE THAT EXCESS WATER GET IT BACK INTO GROUNDWATER- AUTHOR YES GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS SH SO THAT WE ARE BUILDING BACK THAT STORAGE SO WE HAVE RESILIENCY WHEN AGAIN THE WEATHER TURNS TRY INSTRUCTORS WATER IS. LIMITED SO THAT THESE ARE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON NEW CONSTRUCTION WITH SEVERAL OF OUR STATE PARTNERS THE STATE WATER BOARD. HELLO FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE STREAMS AND- WILDLIFE HABITAT AND MAKING SURE THAT'S PART OF THE FACTOR IN ADDITION TO THE- THE HUMAN NEED FOR WATER- WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH. A LOT OF THE LOCAL ENTITIES SO THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES NGOS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES. WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION BEING ONE. OF THOSE PARTNERS SO IT'S KIND OF A NETWORK IF YOU WILL A BUS. OR WALKED AS WATER AND GIGI'S IN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO COME TOGETHER. TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY AND RESILIENCY I THINK THOSE ARE THE KEY WORDS REALLY FOR ME AS I LOOK AHEAD- IN TERMS OF HOW TO. GET THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK DURING THE WET. FLOOD PERIOD CERTAIN OPTION APPEARS BUT THE WET. WEATHER YEARS AND THEN HOW TO BE RESILIENT AND MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THOSE DRIER PERIODS. IN TIME OUR OWN. OPEN FOR CASTING I THINK THE OTHER PIECE OF IT I DON'T TALKED A LOT BIT OF- VW ARE YOU DON'T AS A- IN. OF LOOKING AT RAINFALL AT SNOW PACKED LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES WERE RELEASED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF LAST YEAR WERE REALLY STARTING TO FIND WAYS TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT- SO WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE OUR FORECASTING ABILITIES. BUT I THINK ALLOW US TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT MATCHES THE CONDITIONS. AND WE KNOW THE CONDITIONS OF EXTREME AND THEIR DYNAMIC BUT THE- FORECASTING WILL BE A KEY ELEMENT THAT I THINK HELPS US BE ABLE TO OPERATE AND ADJUST THOSE OPERATIONS AS NEEDED- GIVEN WATER THE WATER YEAR BRINGS US. SO I'M SURE I AM MISSING SOME ELEMENTS BUT- WANTED TO SHARE THOSE TOPPLING STRINGS AND WILL GLADLY TURN IT OVER TO. THE SELLERS FOR STOCKS. I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD OTHER THAN- SENATOR I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED FLOOD IN A DROUGHT HEARING. BECAUSE THEY DO GO TOGETHER YEAH I. IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CTY OF SACRAMENTO HAD SET THE RECORD FOR THE MOST NUMBER OF DRY DAYS WITHOUT PRECIPITATION. IN ON RECORD TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DAYS AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER SET THE RECORD FOR THE MOST RAINFALL WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. SO WE JUST A FEW DAYS APART THOSE TWO DIFFERENT. RECORDS SO I THINK THAT JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE EXTREMES THAT WE ARE FACING UNDER UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND- IN ORDER TO PREPARE AND SUSTAIN THROUGH DROUGHTS WE HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE REALLY FLASHY WENT STORMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF SO- I. GO AWAY AND THIS SEMESTER SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGED AQUIFER RECHARGE HOW DO WE GET THOSE FLOOD WATERS NOT ONLY NOT CLEANING PEOPLE'S HOMES BUT ALSO IN THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN SLOW THEM SPREAD THEM SYNC THEM TO GET THAT WATER INTO THE GROUND. AND THEN ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF FORECASTING SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING WHEN IT'S COMING SO THAT WE'RE NOT DRAINING OUR RESERVOIRS TO CREATE RANDOM. FOR FLOOD CONTROL WHEN WE'RE NOT GONNA GET STOPPED BECAUSE I MEAN THAT WE DON'T NEED TO. CREATE THAT EMPTY ROOM IN THE RESERVOIRS WE CAN STORE THAT WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A STORM COMING- AND THEN WHEN A STORM IS COMING HOW CAN WE PREPARE FOR AND HOW CAN WE BUILD THE FACILITIES AND IT AND IT IS GONNA TAKE CONSTRUCTION- AN INFRASTRUCTURE. OF WEIGHT HOW DO WE GET THE WATER WHERE IT CAN BE SUNK AND THEN HOW DO WE GET THE WATER FROM THERE TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED SO- IN THINKING ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST A BIG ABOVE THE GROUND DAMS AND RESERVOIRS ANYMORE I THINK THAT THAT FUTURE IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT- THIS CONJUNCTIVE USE SPAN. AND IN PARTICULAR FLOOD WATERS AND GROUNDWATER AND HOW DO WE. CAPTURE THAT WATER AND THEN YOU SAID. WELL I WILL. LEAVE MY QUESTION IN THT THAT- THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU BOTH- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU'VE TAKEN- HERE. NEAR THE HOLIDAYS- TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT WATER AND THAT THE DROUGHT OF COURSE AND- AND REALLY LIKE INCENTIVE BUT THIS REALLY IS ABOUT- THE HUMAN IMPACTS THAT- THAT. THAT THE DROUGHT- AND THE CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO BOTH BUT BUT ONE LAST THING THAT A LOSS FROM THIS- PANEL IS IF I COULD HAVE COPIES OF THE SLIDE DECK SO WE CAN. REVIEW OUR- DOWN THE DOWN THE ROAD. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY OUR NEXT STOP ISN'T PANEL OVER TO THE KID AND HUMAN IMPACTS OF FOOD HEALTH AND LABOR WE HAVE OUR FIRST STOP- LESLIE LIPPER A NATURAL RESOURCE ECONOMIST SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL COLUMNIST FOR FOOD FOR THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION THE UNITED NATIONS THE RETIRED- LOVELY WELCOME. AND FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW OKAY GOOD. THANK YOU. I MUST SAY I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THE WIFI HERE IS A LITTLE BIT UNSTABLE SO I'M JUST CROSSING MY FINGERS THAT IT'LL STAY FOR THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION- THIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THIS IN MY PRESENTATION AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA'S REALLY INTERESTING. L. EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CALIFORNIA WATER CALIFORNIA DROUGHT. AND TO MOVE TO A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT POINT OF PERSPECTIVE. OKAY PUT THE SOCK. OKAY. S. S. THAT OKAY GET READY SET. YES WE CAN OKAY GOOD SO LIVING AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE SORT OF TAKING A PERSPECTIVE OF FOOD SECURITY AS USED BY THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS. LOOKING FOR USE IN THAT PERSPECTIVE TO LOOK AT. WHAT ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DROUGHT IMPACTS AND WHAT WE SING ALSO WHAT'S CHANGING ABOUT IT. S. SOME OF WHICH WILL BE OF COURSE NOT AS RELEVANT CALIFORNIA SOME OF THAT WILL BE VERY RELEVANT BUT IN BOTH CASES I THINK WILL HELP. SORT OF CLARIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES OF HUMAN IMPACT SINK IN CALIFORNIA BIT OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT CAME UP THIS YEAR IN THE FATHER WAS A U. N. FOOD SYSTEM SUMMIT. WERE ALSO SOME OF THE DROUGHT AND WATER MANAGEMENT AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN IMPACTS. GOT A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS GOING TO BRING IN A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. SO THIS FRAMEWORK THE FOODSECURITY FRAMEWORK IS ONE THAT'S VERY WIDELY USED WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS CERTAINLY WITH A VERY BIG INTO FOOD RAGER CULTURE WORLD. IT STARTED IN- THE SEVENTIES IN AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETING WHERE THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ON WHAT HOW SHOULD WE DEFINE. WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. AT A DATE THERE WAS A GOOD AGREEMENT ON A DEFINITION WHICH IS NOT THE ONE THAT'S ON THE SLIDE. THE ONE THAT'S ON THE SLIDE IN GREEN IS WHAT THE CURRENT DEFINITION. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF- EVOLUTION IN THE THINKING. IN PARTICULAR AROUND THE FOUR PILLARS THAT IT YOU CAN SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE. AVAILABILITY ACCESS UTILIZATION INSTABILITY. BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THINKING ABOUT. FOOD SECURITY IN GENERAL NOT SPECIFIC TO DRUG TEST FOOD SECURITY THE REAL EMPHASIS WAS ON SUPPLY AVAILABILITY LIKE DO CAN WE PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD FOR THIS GROWING POPULATION. AND THEIR FOOD NEEDS. BUT BY THE EIGHTIES IT BECAME PRETTY CLEAR THAT. ACCESS WAS UNLESS IT WAS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AN ACCESS MEANS COULD YOU GET THE FOOD IF IT'S EVEN IF IT'S THERE EVEN IF IT'S IN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET CAN YOU AFFORD TO BUY IT. BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE MORE EVIDENCE OF. THERE IS PLENTY OF FOOD AROUND BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING HUNGRY BECAUSE THEY LACK ACCESS AND THE REASON THEY LACKED ACCESS WAS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INCOME. OR BECAUSE FOOD PRICES. MORE RISING UP TO EIGHT AND OF COURSE IT'S RELATIVE FOOD PRICE TO INCOME SO THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. FILLED IN THE AXIS DIMENSION IT WAS VERY MUCH A LOT OF CONCERN AROUND THROUGH PRICES AND ALSO. INCOME OF THE POOREST PEOPLE. OF IRAN WHICH IN THE WORLD IS OFTEN IN AGRICULTURE AND I THINK ALSO IN CALIFORNIA. NOT EVEN CALIFORNIA IS QUITE A DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN MANY OF THE YOU KNOW AGRICULTURAL DOMINANT ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD. BUT GLOBALLY THE ROOM MATE IN MOST MOST POOR PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE STILL LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS AND HAVE SOME KIND OF DEPENDENCE ON AGRICULTURE SO THE AXIS DIMENSION IS REALLY KEY IN LOOKING AT AGRICULTURE. INCOME N. WORKERS THEN ALONG CAME UTILIZATION WHICH IS IT STILL YOU KNOW BEING DEVELOPED THEY DISCUSSED A LOT NOW IN CONTEXT OF NUTRITION UTILIZATION REFERS TO CONSUMING FOOD PREPARING IT CHILLED FOOD STORAGE AND FOOD SAFETY. AND MORE RECENTLY THIS BIG EMPHASIS ON LOOKING ON IT IT'S THE NUTRIENT CONTENT. BECAUSE WHEN ED IT YET DID THE SAME THING SO FROM THE NINETIES ON WHEN YOU HAD ENOUGH CALORIES BEING PRODUCED. IN FACT TOO MUCH SO THAT YOU GOT PROBLEMS WITH OBESITY BUT LACK OF MICRONUTRIENTS PEOPLE WERE UNHEALTHY THIS CAUSED REALLY SERIOUS. THAT NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PROBLEMS BIG HEALTH COSTS AND MORTALITY SO UTILIZATION IS SORT OF LOOKING AT THAT THE NUTRITIONAL SIDE OF FOOD SAFETY. AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS STABILITY WHICH IS- GOT MUCH MORE ATTENTION I WAS FINALLY CHANGED AND THIS IS WHERE YOU SEE A LOT ABOUT DROUGHT TOO BECAUSE THEY INCREASE INCIDENCE AND- FREQUENCY AND THE DEPTHS OF EXTREME EVENTS. SO THAT HE WOULDN'T BE FOOD SECURE IF YOU HAD TO. HEY YOU KNOW I AVAILABLE SUPPLY AND YOU COULD AFFORD IT BUT IT WAS UNCERTAIN IT WAS UNRELIABLE SO THAT'S WHAT THIS LAST MENTIONS ABOUT. SO IN THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION I WANT TO DO WITH FOR THE NEXT PART IS JUST WALK A BIT THROUGH THESE- MENTIONS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO DATE IT TO DROUGHT IN IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. BUT FIRST ACTUALLY- FROM THIS SIDE. THIS IS A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT OF THE PHARAOH THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION THIS YEAR LOOKING AT IMPACTS OF DISASTERS AND CRISES ON AGRICULTURE I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING THAT DROUGHT STICKS OUT LIKE THIS IS THE ONE THIS 34% IT HAS THE LARGEST SHARE. I WISH. IS THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF LOSS OF CROP AND LIVESTOCK. COMPARED TO ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF DISASTER CROP BRETT PESCE STORMS EARTHQUAKES FLOODS EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND WILDFIRES. HEY I WAS ACTUALLY NOTICED PRESENCE OF FLOODS WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER THAN DRUGS BUT- DROUGHT IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM FOR AGRICULTURE IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE LOSS IN AGRICULTURE IS THE S. SECTOR GLOBALLY. AREAS BY DIFFERENT PLACES BUT I WILL CHOOSE A SECTOR THAT REALLY ABSORBS THE COST OF DROUGHT MUCH MORE THAN OTHER SECTORS SAY FLOODING OR SOME OF THESE OTHER. EXTREME EVENTS. THE DAMAGE THE COST OF THE DAMAGE IS SPREAD ACROSS IN A DIFFERENT SECTOR SAY INDUSTRY URBAN. OR AS DROUGHT HAS A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE COST IS IN AGRICULTURE. OKAY SO. JUST GOING THROUGH THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF FOOD SECURITY FOR STARTING WITH AVAILABILITY I PUT THIS A SLIDE UP IT'S FROM GUARDIAN ARTICLE FROM SEPTEMBER IT'S KIND OF THE CLASSIC DROUGHT SLIDE OF. THE DROUGHT KENYA. TWO POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK OF STARVATION BUT IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE HERE THIS IS FROM NORTHERN KENYA THIS IS THE PLACE THAT IS TOTALLY RELIANT ON RAINFALL IT'S VERY ISOLATED NOT LINKED TO OTHER MARKETS. VERY FEW OPTIONS IN TERMS OF GETTING FOOD. ANDIT GROWING FOOD IN THE PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD IS MOSTLY PASTORALIST AND THERE'S VERY FEW OPTIONS THERE SO. THIS IS WHERE YOU HAD TO SORT OF LIKE OLD SEVENTIES KIND OF REALLY BIG CONCERN THAT WHEN YOU WERE IN THESE KINDS OF VERY. LIMITED COMMUNITIES LIMITED OPTION COMMUNITIES. AT THE END OF THEIR RAINFALL DEPENDENT AND THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF- THAT- DROUGHT. REDUCING THE FOOD PRODUCTION IN THAT AREA IS A DISASTER. BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ASPECT ON AVAILABILITY IN DROUGHT IMPACTS THEIR SPECIFICITIES DISS THE SLIDE THAT COMES FROM A STUDY THAT WAS DONE LOOKING AT AUSTRALIA WHICH HAS. YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT AND MUCH MORE INDUSTRIALIST TYPE OF AGRICULTURAL MODEL NOT. IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR I THINK IN SOME WAYS CALIFORNIA BUT- THE POINT OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS. THE AUTHOR IS ESTIMATED TO WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURE TO BE THE PRODUCTIVITY BEING THAT THAT HERE YOU ARE USING A MEASURE CALLED TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY SO- WHAT YOU WOULD GET. OUT IT IS IT IS IT FORCES EVERYTHING THAT YOU PUT IN SO FOR ALL THE LABOR THE WATER THE TIME DELAY AND HOW MUCH OUTPUT YOU GET IS. IT SO ACCORDING TO THE MODEL OF WHAT WAS BEING USED IN THE LAND QUALITY ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS THE DOTTED LINE IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE SEEN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURE COURSE PRODUCTIVITY IS REALLY RELATED TO THE RETURNS. AND TODAY TODAY PROFITABILITY OF AGRICULTURE. INSTEAD IT DAVID THE SOLID LINE IS WHAT THE ACTUAL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES WORK AND THIS WAS DURING A PERIOD OF DROUGHT. BUT ALSO AFTER. SO THAT THERE'S- SOME SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S LONGER TERM IMPACTS EVEN ON PRODUCTIVITY AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN IN IMPLICATIONS FOR. OVERALL FOOD PRINT PRODUCTION IN THE WHERE THE VEIL ABILITY DIMENSION OF FOOD SECURITY. THE TO- ACCESS OKAY SO AN ACCESS YOUR MEMBER IS LIKE YOU CAN YOU AFFORD TO GET THE STUDENTS AND- THEY HAVE THINGS TO LOOK AT THERE IS FOOD PRICE. WILL AFFECT ALL CONSUMERS AND FOOD PRICES ARE ON AN UPWARD TREND BUT THERE'S A LOT O BIG DIFFERENCES AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE. BUT THE OTHER BIG IMPACT OF ACCESS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT CLOSELY AS AG AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE REMEMBER THAT'S PART OF IT IF YOU IF YOUR INCOME. IS REDUCED. YOU WILL HAVE LESS ABILITY TO BUY FOOD IMPORT PEOPLE. AND A MUCH LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON FOOD SO IT'S A IT'S A GOOD PRICE. N. EIGHT CAN DECREASE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR IMPACT ON POOR PEOPLE. WHAT WE SEE HERE I WAS LOOKING ACROSS A LOT OF DIFFERENT STUDIES BUT- BECAUSE I JUST EXPECTED THAT YOU WOULD NEVER NORMALLY SEE THAT. DURING A DROUGHT IN A PLACE THAT IS EXPERIENCING DROUGHT IN AGRICULTURAL LOCATION YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE LESS EMPLOYMENT PEOPLE LOSING JOBS ARE LOSING OURS. IT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON IS IN SOME CASESTHAT YOU SAW THE RESPONSE TO DROUGHT WAS THAT FARMERS WERE PUTTING IN MORE LABOR INTENSIVE TYPES OF CROPS. SO THAT ACTUALLY DREW IN MORE LABOR. I THINK ANOTHER ISSUE THOUGH IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE STUDIES THIS- IT TAKES TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT THAT DATE THEY BUILD UP OVER TIME SO. FOR EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE STUDIES FROM BRAZIL IS LOOKING OVER THE PERIOD F NINETEEN SEVENTY TWENTY TEN SO THEY HAD A REALLY LONG PERIOD AND THEY REALLY DETAILED LOOKING AT. THE DROUGHT IN THESE LITTLE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY FOUND BIG IMPACTS THEY FOUND BIG COMMUNITY LEVEL IMPACTS. OF THAT FIRST ON THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR. THIS IS SOME OF THE BUSINESSES GO BROKE. YOU SEE THIS KIND OF- ABANDONMENT OF HOUSES AND TOWNS ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AN UNAMBIGUOUS THING THAT DROUGHT WILL ALWAYS GIVE YOU LOWER- AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE LOWER INCOME. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS MAYBE IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE FULL IMPACTS ARE AND THEY CAN BE QUITE IMPORTANT IN LOOKING AT THE OVERALL FOOD SECURITY IMPACTS. ANOTHER STUDY FROM AUSTRALIA WAS LOOKING AT. SEVERAL INDICATORS. OF INCOME AND THEY ALSO WERE LOOKING AT MENTAL HEALTH AND MEDICATION AND DRINKING WHICH I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO I THINK OTHERS WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT BUT- THE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING HERE IS THAT. THIS SITE HAS THREE COLUMNS SO THIS IS THE ONE TO FOR THIS TO THE LEFT HERE IS. LOOKING AT THE HIGHEST THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT THIS IS KIND OF PRETTY BAD DROUGHT IN THIS IS BAD BUT BUT THE LEAST BAD. SO WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT IN TERMS OF INCOME AFFECTS IT'S ONLY IN THE REALLY REALLY BAD DROUGHT. YOU GET A HUGE NEGATIVE HIT ON INCOME AND THERE'S ASTERIX KENO INDICATING THAT IT'S STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WHAT IS ITS NEGATIVE HERE IN THE BAT PRETTY BAD. BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT SO THE RIGHT THE RESULT ON INCOME IS REALLY LIKE OKAY. IT MAKES YOU THINK. YES DRUGS SEEMS TO BE HAVING. IT IMPACTS ON INCOME THEY WERE LOOKING AT REAL INCOMES AS WELL AS NON RURAL- THEY THEY FIND FURTHER IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL STRESS ACROSS THIS PRETTY BAD PLACE. BUT THE IN THE ACTUAL IMPACTS AN INCOME DIDN'T SHOW THROUGH HERE AND THAT COULD ALSO BE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE SAVINGS IN THAT IT'S AGAIN A TIME THING LIKE I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT OVER TIME. BUT AGAIN ON THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. CERTAINLY I THINK IF YOU TALK TO CALIFORNIA FOR RESEARCH THAT DROUGHT WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT ON FARMING. A MOVE INTO THE FOURTH THE FIFTH THIRD DIMENSIONAL STABILITY. AT THE END I JUST PUT THE SLIDE HERE SHOWING THAT THE INCREASING NUMBER OF EXTREME EVENTS STABILITY ISN'T A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE THERE'S JUST BEEN SO MANY HITS TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. L. AND S. TROOPS EXTREME EVENTS AND THAT'S IT IT'S BECOMING MUCH FOR- MUCH MORE PRIORITY INSISTED SECURITY PROGRAMS. AND THE LAST ONES ON UTILIZATION AND A LOT OF STUDIES AND DROUGHT IN DROUGHT AREAS WITH AGRICULTURAL POPULATION WHICH SHOW THAT PEOPLE START TO SHIFT TOWARDS LESS NUTRIENT DENSE DIETS AS THEY BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING INCOME OR THEY'RE LOSING PRODUCTION. SO THEY TEND TO EAT WORSE NUTRITIONALLY AND THEN THIS HAS LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS. THERE'S ALSO INCREASE OF FOOD SAFETY PROBLEMS DUE TO LACK OF GOOD WATER DRINKING WATER WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT THAT'S THAT'S SUCH AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. AT INCREASED RISK OF WATER CONTAMINATION AND ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED INCIDENCE OF PARASITES BACTERIA VIRUSES. AT A. POSSIBILITY IN NIGHT THIS IS NOT A DISEASE TRANSMISSION SO FOOD SAFETY IS THE REAL CONCERN AROUND. THE S. SCARCITY OF WATER. SO WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING IN THIS IS REALLY A QUICK IN AND OUT A QUICK AND DIRTY ANALYSIS BUT JUST LOOKING THROUGH THOSE FOR- DIMENSIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY WHAT I THINK I HEAR A LOT OF. CALIFORNIA IT'S ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE IT'S BUILDING STORAGE IS FILLING IN FOR IRRIGATION- THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK ON BUILDING AT YOU KNOW GETTING FARMERS TO USE DROUGHT TOLERANT VARIETIES. AND THEN. IN SOME CASES PARTICULARLY. IN SAY LIKE AFRICA RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR NEW MARKET SOURCE TO GET FOOD. AS AS THE DAY TRADITIONAL ONES BECOME LESS RELIABLE I MEAN IN THE CASE OF THE KENYA'S LETTER SHOWED EARLIER THIS SOURCE OF TRUTH EMERGENCY FOOD RELIEF FROM. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM- THE NEW MARKET SOURCES CAN BE KIND OF PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE TO ACTUALLY IMPORT FOOD FIRST OF ALL BUT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGH DEBT. OF FOOD IMPORTS ALREADY AND IT'S IN THERE PAYING INTEREST ON IT SECONDLY YOU NEED A PRETTY ADVANCED INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET. FOD OUT TO PEOPLE LIKE IN THAT THAT PASTORAL AREA. BUT NONE THE LESS THE- THE OF INVISIBILITY THERE'S A FOCUS ON- IMPROVING. THE RESILIENCE OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. AT THE END OF CLIMATE OUT OF. THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF INCREMENTAL ADAPTATIONS FOR THAT YOU'RE DOING KIND OF. WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN DOING THAT BETTER SELECT SAY A GROWING- YOU RICE THAT DROUGHT TOLERANT RICE ARE YOU USING A DIFFERENT KIND OF IRRIGATION METHOD THAT'S FOR. IT YOU KNOW WATER. EGG EFFICIENT. L. BUT THERE'S THE INCREASING CALLS FOR MORE TRANSFORMATIVE FORMS TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THE MAJOR SHIFTS THAT ARE BEING IMPOSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT IS ONE OF THEM. AND THE ACCESS SIDE WHAT'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL IS SOME SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THEN THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES IS FOOD FOOD TRANSFERS BUT ALSO CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME VERY POPULAR. I MEAN THIS ISN'T THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY WHEN IT DEPENDING ON LOCAL FOOD SUPPLIES. AND SO THEIR THEIR THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM HAS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE. BUT OVERALL THERE'S BEEN A HUGE EXPANSION IN SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IN IN AFRICA. AND SOUTH ASIA ALSO IN LATIN AMERICA WAS STILL ONE OF THE PIONEERS AND BRAZIL. AND IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING CERTAIN LEVELS OF FOOD SECURITY- BUT NOW LOOKING AT THE AG EMPLOYMENT ISSUE LIKE SO. BUT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES I THINK COME AND THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE FOOD SYSTEM SUMMIT. THEY'RE STILL HIT A BILLION WHERE. HUGE NUMBER OF VERY POOR PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE RELATED AND- ACTIVITIES IN THIS IS ALSO WHERE THERE'S STILL REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF POPULATION GROWTH. THE AG PRODUCTIVITY ON THOSE FARMS FARMS VERY SMALL FIVE FARM SIZES ARE GETTING UNDER ONE ACTOR. IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR THAT YOU CAN DO ANY KIND OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY OR MARKETING SCHEME THAT WOULD REALLY LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND SO THERE'S A LOT MORE FOCUS ON TRAINING AND LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT BUT PARTICULARLY IN AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS. WHICH UP TO IN THE PAST IT HAS BEEN MUCH MORE OF A FOCUS ON SAY LABOR SUBSTITUTION AS YOU. MOVE INTO FOOD PROCESSING YOU LOOK FOR EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE PLACED LABORS INSTEAD OF LIKE SAY EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD LABORS WOULD USE TO INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY SO THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION THERE ABOUT- SAFETY NET PROGRAMS CAN ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR IN SO LONG. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT- NOT MAYBE ON THE FARM MAYBE NEAR THE FARM. ON STABILITY ALSO QUITE A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON REGIS MANAGEMENT THINGS STABILIZING FOOD PRICE PROGRAM STATE STORAGE BUFFER STOCKS ALSO AGREEMENTS TO AVOID SAY EXPORT BANS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE FOOD PRICE BY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EXPERIMENTAL INSURANCE LIKE THE INDEX INSURANCE PROGRAM SET FOR. FULL SCALE FARMERS THAT'S HAD KIND OF MIXED. RESULTS THAT DIDN'T COME IN A COUPLE OF CASES HAS WORKED A LOT OF CASES AND PROBLEMATIC. TRADE TRADE HAS BEEN INCREASING TRADE NETWORKS HAS BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFUL WAY OF STABILIZING FOOD SUPPLIES AND FOOD PRICES. FINALLY ON UTILIZATION THERE'S- YOU KNOW USING SUBSIDIES ON VOUCHERS TO GO TO MAKES THIS COULD INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO YOU. CONSUME NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS OF LAKE CALIFORNIA AND SAM THAT'S NOT SO FOR IT'S JUST. THAT KIND OF THING WHICH IS MY OFFICE- MORE EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO THE SORT OF BASIC GRAINS- THEN IN TERMS OF LIKE THE FOOD SAFETY ISSUES THAT'S A LOT OF THE FOOD PREPARATION. IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR IT'S NOT LICENSED IT'S NOT. YET IT'S NOT UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL. IT'S IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR AND THERE'S A LOT OF THE FOCUS LOT MORE FOCUS TO WORKING IN THAT SECTOR T. EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE DANGERS OF FOOD. CONTAMINATION AND TO IMPROVE IT. OKAY LET AT THESE TWO KINDS OF. AND ALSO JUST LISTENING TO SOME OF THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS. I THINK THE- IN LOOKING AT DROUGHT IN THE IMPACTS ON HUMANS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF LOOK AT WHICH HUMANS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN AGRICULTURE BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S A VERY CLEARED DEFINED GROUP THAT HAS A SET OF. FAIRLY CARD THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THERE'S ALSO FARMERS BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT A SMALL FARMER RECEIVES A LARGE FARMER AND OF COURSE IN ANY FOOD CONSUMER. ANY CONSUMER SAY CALIFORNIA FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN SOME WAY BY CALIFORNIA DROUGHT. AND THEN I THINK ALSO- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED QUITE A LOT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SHORT RUN SOLUTIONS AND WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM ONES. AND SO IN THE SHORT RUN AS THEY DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS SIDE THAT YOU KNOW THE SAFETY NETS LIKE A CASH PAYMENTS FROM PAYMENTS. BUT THE LONG TERM ONE IS. WHAT IS A VIABLE. AND STABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR DECENT LIVELIHOODS FOR PEOPLE. AND HOW AT N. ALSO SORT OF RECOGNIZING TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE CURRENT LIVELIHOOD YOU JUST NEED A TIDE OVER SO THE NEXT TIME IS TO GET TO THE NEXT TIME OR YOU SHOULD YOU REALLY BE LOOKING FOR CHANGE A REALLY BIG CHANGE. AND THAT'S GOES FOR THE FARMERS AS WELL LIKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT- BUILDING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS THE IMPROVING STORAGE IMPROVING IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SOME FARMERS NEED GOING OUT OF PRODUCTION. AND SO RAISED IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS IN AUGUST AND THE ANSWERS ARE DIFFERENT DEPENDING WHERE YOU WORK- AND SAME THING ALSO ON THE CONSUMERS THE SHORT TERM IS THIS KIND OF SUBSIDY OR EDUCATION PROGRAM SO THAT THE LONG TERM MAY BE MORE IT. MAJOR CHANGES IN FOOD SUPPLY SOURCES IN WHAT THEY CALL FOOD ENVIRONMENTS LIKE WHERE YOU GET YOUR FOOD SUPERMARKETS BUT ALSO RESTAURANTS AND FOOD STANDS. SO THERE'S NO NEED TO CONSIDER WHICH GROUP. OF IMPACT OF PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF IMPACTS. AND OVER WHAT TIME FRAME. THE LAST SLIDE- AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE STUFF- SOMEONE'S MOTIVE IS TALKING ABOUT AND ALSO WHAT'S COMING OUT. OF MORE RECENT DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THAT FOOD SYSTEM SOME CLEAR ACROSS ALL THOSE STUDIES IS EVIDENCE CERTAINLY WAS NOT GONNA SURPRISE ANYBODY. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HARDEST HIT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY IN DEFICIT AS THE HECK. IT ACT LIKE THEY'RE LIKE CALIFORNIA AND GROUNDWATER GUARDIAN DEFICIT THAT'S WHERE THEY TAKE IT EVEN HARDER. SO IN A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN AGRICULTURE IN THIS IS GLOBALLY I MEAN. L. UNDER LOW INCOME PEOPLE THEY CAN BE MINORITY PEOPLES AND A LOT OF THEM ARE. AGRICULTURAL WORKERS THEY'RE NOT USUALLY LANDOWNERS BUT LET THEIR LABORS- ONE ANOTHER COME WITH CONCERT CLICK CONSISTENTLY IN THIS CONTEXT IS. THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE EXPOSED TO LIKE THE EMERGENCY RELIEF BRINGING IN FOOD. AND I THINK THIS WAS ALSO RAISED AT THE BY THE SENATOR AT THE BEGINNING OF LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. DOING MORE OF THE EX ANTE. THE INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCE AND LESS OF THE EMERGENCY IS CERTAINLY A LOT CHEAPER. TO PREPARE WELLS COURSE IS FLOODED IT'S KIND OF TRICKY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE FACING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT- THIS IS A- PRETTY CLEAR. THING THAT IS THE WORST SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH ON THAT THE EMERGENCY EXPOSED ENOUGH. IN ADVANCE- AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH TRANSFORMATIONAL ADAPTATION THOSE LONG TERM CHANGES WHERE THERE'S RECOGNITION THAT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING. GOING ON A LEASH DAVE ARM IT WAS CLIMATE CHANGE WITH POPULATION PATTERNS IT REALLY IMPLIES. A MAJOR MAJOR CHANGE. IS SO FAR WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS MOSTLY INCREMENTAL CHANGE PEOPLE SORT OF STAYING IN THE SAME. OVERALL PICTURE ABOUT AGRICULTURE I MEAN- BUT NOT A MAJOR SHIFT AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PUSHING TO DO THAT BECAUSE- THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR THAT IF WE DON'T DO THAT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE. IN VERY BAD SHAPE. THAT PARTICULAR SUBSAHARAN AFRICA AND SOUTH ASIA. BUT I THINK THAT'S RELEVANT IN OTHER PLACES AS WELL. I DID ALREADY MENTIONED THIS THING ABOUT THE DECENT JOBS THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON LOOK IN THE OLD AGRICULTURAL MODEL AND STILL THERE'S LIKE THE VIEW OF TECHNOLOGY A LOT OF TIMES IS THAT IT SUBSTITUTES FOR LABOR IT REDUCES. THE OVERALL PRODUCTION COSTS THAT'S GREAT. BUT IT'S NOT GREAT IF YOU YOU END UP. GENERATING HUGE BODY OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE THE DAY SORT OF LOVE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. AND THAT THEREFORE THINKING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF- TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT. ENHANCE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY. AND THAT COULD. GENERATE DECENT EMPLOYMENT OVER A LONG TERM. IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS IT'S A CHANGE FROM HOW THINGS WERE. VIEWED IN THE PAST. AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING IN SOME MONEY GOING INTO INVESTING IN THAT. AND THEN A LOT OF FUN IS THIS GREAT RETHINKING AND REDEFINING SUCCESSFUL OR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE NOTHING GOING ON FOREVER. WELL SIMPLY RESET YOUR REFINING AND RETHINKING. BUT ONE THING I THINK IS PROBABLY MOST RELEVANT IN THE CALIFORNIA CONTEXT IS. THERE'S REALLY BIG PROBLEMS WHEN YOU'RE SHORT TERM. SOLUTION BLOCKS THE LONG TERM ONE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE ONE. AND I THINK THAT'S COMING UP LIKE YOU KNOW SUPPORT FOR UNSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION METHODS. FOR IS A PROBLEM IT KEEPS YOU FROM MOVING TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TRANSITION PERIODS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP A LITTLE AND- THAT WAS A BIG. ISSUE IN THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT. ALTHOUGH NOT A LOT OF SOLUTIONS I WAS STILL IN WHAT DO YOU DO BECAUSE. THE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS- I SOMETIME IN THEY ARE. TO IN THEY DO. TO THERE IS A VERY STRONG URGENCY TO THOSE KINDS OF. MEASURES SO. I THINK PART OF THE DISCUSSION THERE THOUGH IT IS LIKE THIS LONG TERM IT GET THE LONG TERM. INVESTMENTS IN PLACE FASTER THAN WE'RE DOING SO FAR. OKAY AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS THEY COME UP. THANK YOU LOVELY PLEASE STAND BY WHAT WILL I BE HEARING FROM OUR NEXT PANELIST FOR THE SECTION AND THAT'S DR JASMEET BAYNES. SHE'S A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND DOCTOR BAINES FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY.GOOD AFTERNOON- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TERROR ON MADAM CHAIR CENTER TOWN CENTER MELINDA'S- I THINK THIS IS. A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AREA DISCUSSION SO I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING AN ORGANIZING THIS PANEL TOGETHER- I AM A BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN- IN ADDITION TO WORK IN ADDICTION MEDICINE- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I CURRENTLY PRACTICE IN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA. THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF THE DROUGHT ARE VERY REAL- THEY ARE VERY APPARENT TO THOSE OF US IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS WE WITNESS IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN OUR PRACTICES AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE NEED TO WAKE UP WE NEED TO WAKE UP TO THE REALITY OF THE BIGGEST LACKS OF AXIS OUR PEOPLE SUFFER- AS A PHYSICIAN I HAVE SPENT MANY YEARS WORKING ABROAD. INCREASING HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO QUOTE ON QUOTE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND I HAVE TO SAY. I'VE SEEN VERY MANY SIMILARITIES OF MY OWN COMMUNITY HERE TEN VITAMINS I HAVE SEEN ABROAD. AND IN MANY SITUATIONS MY COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO SUFFER THE MOST DEVASTATING RESULTS OF CHANGES THAT ARE. HAPPENING IN MANY MANY WAYS. THE CDC OR- THAT. THE DROUGHT IS INCREASING READ. DRAW IS CAUSING REDUCED STREAM AND RIVER FLOWS THAT CAN INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION OF POLITICS AND WATER- AND THEN THE FURTHER STAGNATION OF WATER AS WELL HIGHER WATER TEMPERATURES IN LAKES AND RESERVOIRS LEADING TO REDUCED OXYGEN LEVELS THAT CAN IMPACT FISH AND OTHER AQUATIC LIFE IN WATER QUALITY. A RUNOFF FROM DROUGHT RELATED WILDFIRES CAN CARRY EXTRICITY MEN ASKED HER GOAL AND WE NEED TO BREED TO SURFACE WATERS KILLING FISH OTHER QUANTIC LIFE BY DECREASING THE OXYGEN LEVELS IN THE WATER. MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES DEPEND ON THE GROUND WATER AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE. OF THE- WATER AS WELL. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND TALK ABOUT FOOD I THINK LESLIE DID A GREAT JOB TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL- AND THE- LOT OF THE PANELS FOR TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL THE DRUG COULD LIMIT GROWTH OF FOOD RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OF FOOD. AND SHORTAGES WHICH WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING THE HEALTH IMPLICATION OF MALNUTRITION WHICH WAS ALSO DISCUSSED EARLIER IS ALREADY BEING WITNESSED IN CLINICS ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY I'M IN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL- AND IT'S FURTHER BE EXACERBATED BY DISTRAUGHT WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR PATIENTS- IN ADDITION TO INCREASING ON HEALTHY EATING AS WELL. I'LL LET'S GO AHEAD TALK ABOUT AIR QUALITY DURING THE DROUGHT THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR WILDFIRES WHICH WE ALL KNOW AND DUST STORMS AS WELL I'M LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY VALLEY FEVER IT'S A BIG CONCERN THERE- PARTICULATE MATTER SUSPENDED IN THE AIR FROM THESE EVENTS CAN IRRITATE THE BRONCHIAL PASSAGES OF. AND ONES AND THIS IS LEADING TO INCREASED CASES OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES WHICH WE ARE EXPERIENCING AND SEEING AND WORSENING DAY BY DAY- THE INCREASED RISK FOR RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA AND OF COURSE CODE NINETEEN. IS INCREASING AND BEING EXACERBATED BY OUR DROUGHT AS WELL- WITH INCREASED DUST AND DRY CONDITIONS CREATED OTHERS- JUST CREATING IT'S CREATING A EIGHTY ATMOSPHERE FOR MORE WILDFIRES AND THE SOMEWHAT KEENE VALLEY AIR DISTRICT- OUR RESEARCH TEAMREPORTS THAT AIR QUALITY IS BEING MAJORLY AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES- WHICH IS FURTHER EXACERBATING CHRONIC. OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASES IN OUR PATIENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH IS WHERE I PRACTICE- AND ESPECIALLY SOMEONE- AS ME I PERSONALLY SUFFER FROM ASTHMA MYSELF- SO I EXPERIENCE A DAY TO DAY IN ADDITION TO SEEKING THE INCREASES IN MY PATIENTS AS- WELL. DROUGHT BECAUSE THE INCREASED. OF- PER. AND AIRBORNE TALK AS WELL WHICH IS STUDY WELL AS WELL- THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE HAVE SEEN WHENEVER THERE IS A WATER SHORTAGE- SANITATION AND HYGIENE OR CHALLENGE CREATING MORE DISEASE AND INFECTIONS SPREAD. INCLUDING HAND WASHING SO HANDWASHING IS ACTS ACTUALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE DETERRENT FOR KOBE NINETEEN ASCO NINETEEN IT'S AN ENVELOPED VIRUS- COMPROMISING HANDWASHING SPELLS NIGHTMARES FOR KOBE NINETEEN ECONOLINE SALMONELLA SPREAD AS FAR. THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASES RAINFALL DECREASES VERY WELL STUDIED AS BACTERIA AND VIRUSES CAN POLLUTE BOTH- SURFACE OF SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER FROM STAGNATION I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ALSO GONE OVER THIS AS WELL- STAGNATION OF WATER CAN ALSO INCREASE MOSQUITO BREEDING GROUNDS- WHICH CARRY DISEASES LIKE WEST NILE. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS HUGE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CASES ARE ALSO RISING. TO STOCK UP ON VALLEY FEVER- THE DROUGHT INCREASES FUNGAL INFECTION SPREAD INCLUDING- IT SPREADS THE COXETER MY NKOSI'S FUNGUS RESPONSIBLE FOR VALLEY FEVER ON TOP. OF THE ALREADY RISING CASES OF VALLEY FEVER IN OUR VALLEY- WE HAD A BLAST I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH UPON MENTAL HEALTH- THE PANDEMIC HAS PROVEN- THE IMPACT AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS- THAT WE ARE IN IS MORE SECURE THAN WE THOUGHT- THE FINANCIAL RELATED STRESS THE WORRIES- JUST WORSENS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY WE SEE IT. EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY IN CLINICS- IN ADDITION TO INCREASING ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SADLY INCREASE IN THE SUICIDE RATE- I AM IN THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR BUT YOU'RE STILL RECOVERY SERVICES AND WE ARE SEEING IN VERY ALARMING INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. IN ADDITION TO SUICIDE RATE AS WELL HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- MENTAL HEALTH IS BEING IMPACTED FROM VERY MANY ASPECTS- AND THE DROP IS DEFINITELY NOT HELPING- AREAS OF FOCUS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- INCLUDING RESEARCH IS. YOU KNOW THE DIRECT EFFECT OF THE DROUGHT ON OUR WORKERS OUT IN THE FARMS ON OUR OUTDOOR WORKERS AND THEN OF COURSE OUR CHILDREN AS WELL AS WE HAVEN'T- AS MANY PEOPLE. HAVE- DESCRIBED BEFORE INADEQUATE TO WATER. INTO OF THE HEALTH OF KIDS- ARMOR AND LASTING I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION IS A LOT OF THIS ALSO AFFECTS OUR WILDLIFE OF WILDLIFE AND OUR DEAR USER AND TO OUR LIVESTOCK THAT WE HAVE- WHAT'S NOT VALLEY FEVER ALSO AFFECTS ANIMALS AS IT DOES AFFECT. HUMANS AS WELL SO WITH THAT THAT WAS ALL I WANTED TO ADD- AND- ALL CUSTOMERS NEXT WEEK OR- THANK YOU DR BRAINS AND OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS- CHRISTINA GREENE ASSISTANT RESEARCH SCIENTIST A CLIMATE ASSESSMENT FOR THE SOUTHWEST. A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I AM A HUMAN GEOGRAPHER AND I STUDY THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF DROUGHT AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING PEOPLE'S ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. AND TODAY I WANT TO PRESENT ON RESEARCH THAT I CONDUCTED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY DURING THE. 200-012-2000 SIXTEEN DROUGHT. AND AS WELL AS OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE ADDRESSED DROUGHTS ARE REALLY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER NATURAL HAZARDS. DESCRIBED AS SLOW MOVING HAZARDS. AND SO- SOCIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT WE SEE FROM DROUGHTS HAVE A LONG LAG TIME. AND THEY OFTEN PRESENT LONG AFTER THE DROUGHT IS OVER. WE HAVE. A HUGE SUITE OF TOOLS AND INDICATORS THAT MONITOR THE PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF DROUGHT SO HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS HOW MUCH PRECIPITATION BUT WE REALLY HAVE A WAYS TO GO AND IDENTIFYING AND TRACKING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DROUGHT AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE. ONGOING SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC PROCESS SEES THAT- IMPACT LIVELIHOODS AND WELL BEING. AND- FORMER KURDISH HAVE REMAINED LARGELY INVISIBLE DURING DROUGHT A LOT OF ATTENTION IT'S PAIN TO THE FARMERS THEMSELVES BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR WORKERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. A LOT OF THIS. HAS TO DO WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED STATUS OF MANY FARM WORKERS AND THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO REPORT ON THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND SO TODAY I AM PRESENTING ON THE RESEARCH THAT I CONDUCTED IN THE SN JOAQUIN VALLEY OVER SEVERAL YEARS. AND I INTERVIEWED A LOT OF FARM WORKERS FARMERS SOCIAL WORKERS. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHO ARE WITNESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT- I ALSO CONDUCTED HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS. INVOLUNTARILY DISTRIBUTION AND FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES. AND I CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT UNEMPLOYMENT AND WILL BE THAT IS HOW IS IT IMPACTING FOOD SECURITY HOW IS IT IMPACTING WATER SECURITY AND HEALTH. IN SOME CONTEXT SOME OF THIS HERE'S A QUOTE FROM A NONPROFIT DIRECTOR WHO SPENT DECADES IN THE REGION. STROUT IS A CANCER I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVEN MAJOR DISASTER RESPONSES WILL FREEZE WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. WE LOSE THE ORANGES AND THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK. RIGHT WITH AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. WE HAVE A DROUGHT IT IS A SLOW KILL EACH YEAR IT IS LIKE A CANCER RATHER THAN HEART ATTACK. WE HAVE A HEART ATTACK IT IS IMMEDIATELY DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IT GOES ON KILLING YOU UNDETECTED. AND ONE OF THE MAJOR AREAS THAT. DROUGHT IMPACTS FARM WORKERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL HAS TO DO WITH LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT. AND A COMMUNITY WORKER THEY INTERVIEWED SHE DESCRIBED IT AS A CONDITION OF UNDER EMPLOYMENT. SO FARMERS DON'T HAVE ONE JOB THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THEY'RE OFTEN TAKING VERY SHORT. JOBS ONE AFTER ANOTHER SO I AM SO I SPOKE WITH ONE FARMER CRAIG SHE DESCRIBED HER HERE TO ME AND SHE SAYS. IT ALL IN A COUPLE WEEKS PICKING GRAPES AND THEN I'LL GO AND SPEND ANOTHER WEEK COUPLE WEEKS FIGHTING TO MALES AND IT'S CONTINUOUS SO WHILE THEY STILL HAD SOME LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT DURING THE DROUGHT. OVERALL THERE WAS LESS WORK. I AM I CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN TULARE AND FRESNO COUNTY AND 76% OF THE PEOPLE SURVEYED SAID THERE WAS LESS WORK AVAILABLE IN 65% DECREASED AND THE REPORTED. A DECREASE IN INCOME DURING THE DROUGHT. A LOT OF FARMWORKERS EXPLAINED IF THEY HAD A TROUBLE A LOT FARTHER DID YOU FIND WORK SO. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES IN MENDOTA. HEIGHTS NEAR FRESNO WERE TURNED IN DURING THIS TIME WERE TRAVELING TWO TO THREE HOURS EACH WAY TO FIND WORK IN REGIONS LIKE SALINAS VALLEY. A LOT OF THE FARM WORKERS ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE CLOSURE FOR PACKING PLANTS IS NOT ONLY NECESSARILY. WORK BUT ON THE ON THE FARM ITSELF ALONG THE- PRODUCTION PROCESS. IT INTO THE REGION ALSO WITNESSED A DECREASE AND MIGRATORY WORKERS ARE KIND OF TWO CATEGORIES THE FARMWORKERS THEIR FARM WORKERS WHO LIVE IN THE REGION YEAR ROUND. AND THERE ARE FORMER BECAUSE YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING BETWEEN WASHINGTON STATE OREGON AND ARIZONA AND SO DURING THIS TIME PERIOD THEY JUST SKIPS SEVENTEEN VALLEY BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH WORK AVAILABLE. AND THIS HAD IMPACTS ON LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT WERE SET UP TO SUPPORT THEM DURING THIS TIME PEOPLE TALK TO ME- ABOUT NORMALLY IT DURING A CITY LIKE WINDOW THAT. WOULD SWELL BY EMAILING NUMBERS BY THOUSANDS WHEN THESE MIGRATORY WORKERS COMMAND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HOUSING AND- BUSINESSES THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT THEM AND SO THEY HAVE AS BIG IMPACTS DURING THIS TIME. AND THIS WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER AND DOCTOR LIPPER'S PRESENTATION. BEING DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT ON FARM WORKERS HAS TO DO WITH THE- LABOR DEMANDS OF EACH CROP. AND HERE IN THIS GRAPH WE CAN SEE HOW MANY JOBS EACH ACRE OF CROPS PROVIDES FOR FARM WORKERS AND THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THIS NUMBER COMES FROM A STUDY DONE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND SO IT REALLY DEPENDS WHAT. FARMERS ARE DECIDING TO NOT PLAN DURING YOUR DURING A ROUTE THAT IMPACTS FARM WORKERS SO IF YOU'RE IN A PASTURE WHICH IS ONLY PROVIDED ONE OR TWO JOBS ON AVERAGE. ARE FOLLOWED IT DOESN'T HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON FARM WORKERS BUT- WHAT WE SEE IS THAT DURING THE DROUGHT OFTEN THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT HAVE A HIGH LABOR DEMAND ARE FOLLOWED. SO THIS WOULD BE THE SITE MELONS AND SQUASH AND CUCUMBERS AND MELONS PROVIDE ON AVERAGE IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO JOBS PER ACRE FOR FARM WORKERS- AND- DURING THIS TIME WE ALSO SAW THAT FARMERS WERE BEING ACTUALLY INCREASING. THE NUMBER OF ALMONDS PISTACHIOS AND TREATMENTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY AREN'T VEN THOUGH THEY DO REQUIRE MORE WATER. THEY WERE HAVING HIGHER RETURNS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS SO I'M A RESERVIST TIMER KIND OF DOUBLE HIT ONE BECAUSE THERE WAS LESS- THE DROUGHT LEADING FARMERS TO NOT PLANT TOMATOES AND STUFF BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS THERE IS A DECREASE IN JOBS AVAILABLE FOR ALL. AND SO HERE'S WELL FROM A- STAFF MEMBER FROM NONPROFIT YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH FARMERS. AND SHE TOLD ME MORE INFORMATION IS GETTING BACK TO US FOR A FARMER WHO COMMUNITIES IMPACTS SUCH AS LOWER HOURS AND SHIELDS WORK CHANGING SPORADICALLY ACTUALLY GETTING THREATS FROM FARMERS SAYING IF IT DOESN'T RAIN. THEY'RE GOING TO LAY OFF OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. THE SECOND I MENTIONED THAT I STUDY DURING THE DROUGHT HAD TO DO WITH THE IMPACT OF THE DROUGHT ON. FARMWORKER ENROLL RESIDENTS OVERALL WELL BEING. THE COMBINATION OF UNDER EMPLOYMENT AND INCREASED GROUNDWATER PUMPING DURING THE DROUGHT HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON THE WELL BEING. OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO FOOD AND SECURITY WATER AND SECURITY AND HEALTH. PEOPLE INTERVIEWED REPORTED INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR FOOD PAY FOR UTILITIES AND PAY FOR RENT. AND THEY ALSO REPORTED. I'M HAVING JUST LESS FOOD IN THE HOUSE OVERALL. THE BIGGEST AND MOST DRAMATIC IMPACT WAS ON WATER AND SECURITY. IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE REGION ARE DEPENDENT ON DOMESTIC WATER WELLS BETWEEN DRY DURING THE DROUGHT. AND IN THE MEDIA THIS IS- THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTS OF A COMMUNITY SUPPORTER BELT WHERE MANY OF THE HOUSES WENT FOR YEARS WITHOUT ANY RUNNING WATER. AT FRESNO COUNTY THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY. WELLS REPORTED DRY INTO LARRY COUNTY IT'S JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND. BUT AS THIS IS VASTLY UNDER REPORTED. BECAUSE MANY RURAL RESIDENTS ARE HESITANT TO REPORT FOR FEAR OF BEING DEPORTED. FOR BEING EVICTED BY THEIR LANDLORDS OR FOR HAVING THEIR TAKEN CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY BY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR LIVING IN A HOUSE WITHOUT RUNNING WATER. PEOPLE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ON WATER QUALITY. SOME OF THE FAMILIES I SPOKE WITH HAD STOPPED DRINKING THEIR WATER BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT SMELLED AND TASTED. AND A LOT OF REPORTS AND STUDIES THAT ANALYZE THE WAY THE DROUGHT IMPACTS WATER QUALITY OVERALL. AND MANY OF THE FARM WORKERS AND RURAL RESIDENTS ALSO SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THE WAYS CHALLENGE AND RESPECTED HEALTH. PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER AFFORD HEALTH CARE AND THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BY CRITICAL MEDICINES. IN COPING WITH DRY WELLS WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. I SPOKE WITH ONE WOMAN WHO IS PART OF L. WHO HAD BEEN UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER. AND SHE'S GOING TO CHEMOTHERAPY. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE RUNNING WATER AT HOME IT'S JUST SO YOU KNOW ABOUT GROWING UP IN MEXICO WHERE SHE DIDN'T HAVE RUNNING WATER BUT SHE MOVED TO THE U. S. AND THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING SHE HAD. SHE WOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN. SORRY THIS IS ANOTHER WOMAN WHO LIVED IN PORTERVILLE AND WENT THREE YEARS WITHOUT WATER. AND SHE SAYS FOR THIS TRIAL I HAD TO HUMBLE MYSELF MY HUSBAND HAD A STROKE AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO LIFT THE WATER JUGS. WE CANNOT USE OUR LAUNDRY MACHINE AND HAD TO GO TO A LAUNDROMAT. I LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT FROM THE STRESS OF THE STRAP I WOULD FLUSH THE TOILETS WITH RAIN WATER. I READ IT IS LEGAL TO CATCH THAT RAIN WATER BUT I WOULD SECRETLY DO IT THIS TRIAL HAS BROUGHT ME TO MY NEEDS OF THE WATER DISTRIBUTION POINTS- HERE THE WATER JUGS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE WIDER CARDS SO PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THESE PUNCH CARDS. AND ONCE A WEEK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COME IN AND PICK UP BOTTLED WATER. THE PICTURE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS. THANKS ANOTHER WATERSHED. AND THIS IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF WATER IN THE KITCHEN THE WOMAN'S HOUSE. AND IT WAS JST INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TIME FOR PEOPLE AND A VERY EMOTIONAL TIME FOR THEM AS WELL. FINALLY A MESSAGE I HEARD SEVERAL TIMES FROM FARM WORKERS AND RURAL RESIDENTS WITH THE NEED FOR MORE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT. AND MORE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND FOREIGN JOBS. I MENDOTA FARM WORKER THAT I MET DURING THE DISTRIBUTION EXPLAINED. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THEY BRING THIS FOOD BUT WE WANT MORE WORK TO GET MORE FIT TO GET MORE RESOURCES TO GET MORE FOR THE FAMILY I NEED TO PAY RENT I NEED TO GET MY KIDS CLOTHES I NEED TO GET SOMETHING BETTER TO MY KIDS AND WE DON'T HAVE IT IN JUST BRING FOOD. AND SHOPS. AND SO THESE ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS FROM MY RESEARCH. DROUGHT RELIEF REQUIRES CLEAR COORDINATION GUARD WORKING RELATIONSHIP pACROSS DIVERSE AREAS OF EXPERTISE. IT'S NOT. DROUGHT WASN'T JUST ABOUT LABOR AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT WATER AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT HELP. IT IS ALL THOSE THINGS COMBINED. AT A LAPTOP TONIGHT SPOKE WITH SOCIAL WORKERS IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND THEY WERE OVERWHELMED DURING THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THOUSAND EXTREME DROUGHT. THEN THEY JUST STATEMENT. PREPARATION COORDINATION AMONG PEOPLE. THERE'S ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE MORE DIVERSE VOICES IN WATER MANAGEMENT DROUGHT PLANNING NOT JUST A FARM WORKERS BUT ALSO THE FARM WORKERS. FINALLY THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED FOR MORE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT IN BOTH COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE DROUGHT RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND NOT JUST DEPENDENCY ON JOBS THAT COME IN GOD'S WHICH IS WHAT. YOU GET IN THE FIELD. I'M SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE A LOT OF THIS WORK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES BUT- THE STATE WIDE. THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THAT. AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND FEEL FREE TO SPEAK UP IF YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE- I'M- VERY THANKFUL TO YOU ALL- TO YOU EACH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- YEAH YOU'RE FOR DOCTOR LIPPER I. YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES ABILITY TO GROW FOOD WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE- WHAT IS A DROP IN CALIFORNIA MEAN FOR A FOOD SECURITY GLOBALLY. WELL THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION TO ANSWER. BUT THE- CALIFORNIA IS A MAJOR SUPPLIER I HAVE IT PRETTY GOOD THESE NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS THAT ARE NOW BEING REALLY HIGHLIGHTED AS IMPORTANT FOR FOOD SECURITY. SO IT THE IMPLICATIONS AND IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH OTHER PRODUCERS AT FIRST WELL DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES BUT ITS OWN PRODUCTION HOUSE HOW IS CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION GET IT CHANGED. IN THIS CONTEXT THIS. AT THE END OF THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO OTHER GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CHANGE. AND IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION FROM CALIFORNIA SOURCES ARE THERE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY. AS THAT THERE'S SOME ANALYSIS LOOKING AT YES THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES BUT- I'VE NOT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA BUT JUST POSSIBILITIES OF NEW AREAS COMING INTO PRODUCTION WITH DIFFERENT KINDS O CROPS. BUT ALSO SOME OF THE CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER EXPERTS LATER ON MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT. YEAH THESE ARE BIG BIG CHANGES SO LIKE THE INCREASED INCIDENCE OF EXTREME EVENTS IS CHANGING IT FOR EVERYBODY EVEN IF YOUR CONDITIONS. OF PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA. BILL THE IT'S- IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT YOU WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO AND IT'S STILL ABLE TO DO. IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE SUBSTITUTED IF IT. TURNS OUT THAT THAT CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. I I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE NET AND AREA TO TELL YOU LIKE WHAT I WHAT ARE THE MODELS TELLING US ABOUT HOW HOW FEASIBLE IS IT TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S. CURRENT STATE OF PRODUCTION. BUT I DO THINK A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT IS WHAT IT IS SUBSTITUTION POSSIBILITIES YES THERE MAY BE BUT EVEN THESE ARE GOING TO BE HIT BY SOME OF THE SAME I DO IS MAYBE NOT THE SAME BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HIT BY PROBLEMS AND IT WON'T BE THE SAME LEVEL. AS WE SAY IN THE PAST AND SO THEREFORE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ALSO AND ARE WE LOOKING AT A LONG TERM INCREASE IN FOOD PRICES AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. OVERALL AND THAT'S THAT'S GOT A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS FOR POOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT- ACTUALLY FOOD PRICES AND- OBVIOUSLY IT'S- PAYING A LIVING WAGE AND BEYOND FOR EMPLOYEES ARE AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES FOR FARM WORKERS- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT- HOW HOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR THOUGHTS OR IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN. WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS PRESENTING ON US- ON IT HOW DO HOW DO WE BALANCE AT ALL IN TERMS OF KEEPING FOOD PRICES DOWN BUT- CONTINUING OR IF NOT IMPROVING ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO IMPROVE WE NEED TO IMPROVE ON. PAIN BEYOND THE EIGHTY EIGHT- LIVING WAGE TO TWO FARM WORKERS AND AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR IDEAS AND- IN THAT REGARD. I CAN JUST TELL YOU SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS AS **** CLICK IN THE- FOOD SYSTEM SOME OF BUT ALSO TO SENIORS WORKING OUT FILE JUST LOOKING ON. THE RETURNS TO CAPITAL VERSUS RETURNS TO LABOR SO THAT INVESTMENTS CAPITAL IT IT IT DID THERE'S DISCUSSION AROUND MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE A OF MORE. EQUAL SHARING OF THE BENEFITS BETWEEN THE INVESTMENT CAPITAL AND SAVE X. WHAT EQUITY CAPITAL PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN INDUSTRIES IN PARTICULAR AGRICULTURE THIS IS BIG DISCUSSION. SO HOW TO DO THAT AND IS ANYBODY DOING IT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S ACTUALLY HAD A SUCCESSFUL. BUT AT THE HAVE SAID DON'T KNOW BUT- IT'S- ONE OF THE SORT OF IT VERY BASIC THING THAT THERE'S BEEN THIS HIGHER RETURN TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST. FINANCIAL CAPITAL WHERE IS THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SAY HAVE THE LABORS ARE GETTING A LOWER SHARE OF THE BENEFITS AND THAT'S CHANGED OVER TIME IT USED TO BE HIGHER. THAT THE THERE WAS A MORE EQUAL SPLIT BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE RETURNS AND SO THEREFORE WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH HOW THAT WORKED IN THE PAST YOU COULD LOOK AT THOSE MODELS AND TRY TO. GO BACK USE SOME OF THOSE TECHNIQUES TO. TO GET A MORE EQUITABLE. DIVISION OF THE RETURNS FROM THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU AND THE OTHER QUESTION- EITHER PRODUCTIVE INTERACTIVE PREEN- AND IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE GET YOUR DOES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE DROUGHT. ANOTHER'S DOCTRINE PROVIDED A LOT OF EXAMPLES ARE I MEAN IT WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU HEARD OR HAVE YOU SEEN IN TERMS OF. IT'S NOT JUST THE DROP IN EXTREME HEAT BECAUSE AS WE MENTIONED HE HAS MENTIONED EARLIER AT. THE DROP THIS DOES IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T COME ALONG YOU ALSO SEE EXTREME HEAT EXTREME. TEMPERATURES AND- WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF- THE IMPACTS TO HEALTH OR THE WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THESE TWO. HE DEFINITELY DID COME UP IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH FARM WORKERS. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY A A FARM WORKER CAN STAY IN THE FIELD DEPENDING ON- THE TEMPERATURE AND THEY DID SAY THEY WOULD GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BREAKS IF TEMPERATURES FOR. OVER A HUNDRED AND- THEY'RE ALLOWED TO WATER BREAKS I THINK DONE ON THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY RANGE FOR IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW CLIMATE PROJECTIONS ARE TO GET HIGHER TEMPERATURES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. ENSURING THAT A LOT OF FARM WORKERS KNOW ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS- DURING THIS TIME I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YEAH I JUST I WANT TO TACKLE- THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AS A FEW OTHERS- YES SO IN IN THE PSYCHIATRIC WORLD WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS CAN MESS WITH THE AUTO REGULATION WE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE HOW OUR BODY REGULATES THAT TEMPERATURE. SO YEAH I KNOW IT'S A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE WINTER'S EXTREME HEAT PEOPLE ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS WILL RESPOND TO IT DIFFERENTLY THEY MIGHT- ACTUALLY IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED YEARS FOR US BUT IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FOR THAT SO- THAT'S A REAL IMPLICATION FIRM ON THE PSYCHIATRIC ASPECT OF PATIENTS AND OF COURSE MENTAL HEALTH- BUT YEAH NO IT'S OF EXTREME CONCERN HEAT STROKES- ARE REAL THEY'RE ON THE RISE. I AM AND I REALLY REALLY WORRY ABOUT OUR ELDERLY POPULATION BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM- AS YOU GROW OLDER YOU DON'T YOU CANNOT RETAIN YOUR BODY HEAT AS WELL ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG BABIES SPECIALLY AT AT YOUR EXTREME AT YOUR EXTREME AGES SO YEAH- IT'S GONNA DEFINITELY A FACTOR ELDERLY POPULATION AS WELL AND IT HAPPENS- IN IN VERY MANY WAYS AND WE SEE THAT. IN OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AS WELL SO THERE'S A VERY. EXTREME- THE EMPLOYEE. OF THE DRAW AND THE EXTREME WEATHER AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR SECOND SECOND PANEL I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU'VE DONE AND YOU CONTINUE TO DO AND THE SPACE. R. AND- WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO OUR THIRD PANEL OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL. AND IT'S HARD TO MOVE FORWARD. TO IT AND THE FIRST SPEAKER THAT WE HAVE IS LOUDER ROMMEL'S ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA WATER INSTITUTE AT FRESNO STATE AND MODEL WALK COMPLETES UP FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AND IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M GONNA SHARE. ONE OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS AS WELL AS A RECENT STUDY THAT. FOCUSES ON HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN. ERIC I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M SO WE BUT WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM- THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IS THAT WATER SHORTAGE IS GOING TO CAUSE A LOT OF CHANGES AND PROBLEMS MOVING FORWARD AND SOME OF THOSE ARE BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION GROWTH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CHANGES IN CLIMATIC AGING OR DETERIORATING INFRASTRUCTURE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT ENDANGERED SPECIES DECLINES AS WELL AS- FRAGMENTED CALIFORNIA WATER INSTITUTE AT FRESNO STATE BEGAN AND THIS EFFORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND IT WAS ACTUALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESILIENT PORTFOLIO INITIATIVES ARE CENTER HAD TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS ON TWO SATURDAYS THAT INCLUDED URBAN AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENTAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY ADVOCATES FROM THOSE SESSIONS THEY MADE. FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE SHOULD CREATE A SHARED VISION FOR WATER IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. PREPARE A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL WATER INVESTMENT PLAN. THAT INCLUDED THAT SHARED VISION CREATED AN ORGANIZATIONAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STRUCTURE FOR IMPLEMENTING THAT VISION. DEVELOPING AND FINANCIAL STRATEGY TO FUND THE SHARED VISION AS WELL AS DEVELOP A PROJECT DELIVERY PLAN. AS LESLIE MENTIONED EARLIER- DURING HER PRESENTATION ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN DROUGHT STUDY. THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON INCOME DUE TO WATER SHORTAGES AND AS- CHRISTINA MENTIONED THERE WILL ALSO BE IMPACTS TO EMPLOYMENT IN THE SANFORD CAME VALLEY. FROM OUR STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WILL BE AN ESTIMATED FARM RECEIPTS DECLINE OF ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT WATER SHORTAGES WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE IF WE DO NOTHING- THE OTHER IMPACTS THAT IT WILL HAVE INCLUDE STATE WATER OPERATING INCOME LOSSES. AS WELL AS STATE WIDE EMPLOYEE INCOME LOSSES AND STATEWIDE EMPLOYEE INCOME LOSSES AND THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO AS AS CHRISTINA MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS NOT JUST THE AG JOBS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPORTING INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT DEPEND ON THOSE WORKERS SUCH AS STORES GROCERY STORES AND OTHERS. AND SO WE ESTIMATE OUR STUDY ESTIMATED THAT THERE WILL BE A TOTAL OF STATEWIDE TOTAL LOSSES OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND- JOBS AGAIN IF WE DO NOTHING TO CORRECT OR TO IMPROVE THE WATER SHORTAGE CONDITIONS. AND THIS WILL HAVE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL TAX LOSSES OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE BECAUSE ALL OF THESE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT- WILL NOT BE. WORKING AND SO- IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR MILAN DAYS- QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO DO SOMETHING. RACHEL MENTIONED THAT IT WAS AN ESTIMATE OF FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE CONDUCTED A STUDY AND OUR ESTIMATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN WAS THAT IT WOULD COST AN ESTIMATED SEVEN BILLION FOR A ONE TIME WATER INVESTMENT PROGRAM- AS RACHEL ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER. WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD LATELY DURING THIS DROUGHT AT EMERGENCY RESPONSE BUT WE NEED TO STOP THINKING OF EMERGENCY HOW TO RESPOND IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY WE NEED TO START PLANNING NOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. AND SO OUR STUDY INCLUDED A PLAN FOR. FUNDING OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NEXT FORTY YEARS AND CREATED THESE CHANGES AS WAS MENTIONED I BELIEVE FROM SEVERAL EARLIER THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL IT IS NOT JUST NEW SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS IT IS NOT JUST- ONE OR ANOTHER IT IS A BUFFET OF ITEMS THAT ARE NEEDED. AND IT ALL STARTS FROM WATERSHED MANAGEMENT WE CA'T THINK OF IT AS MANAGING THE WATER FROM THE RIVER OR FROM THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO THINK OF IT. AS THE ENTIRE WATERSHED STARTING FROM THE HEADWATERS FIRES IS CAUSING HIM. PROBLEMS WHEN IT RAINS WITH WATER QUALITY AND JUST DEBRIS THAT IS GOING AND THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING TO BE TREATED SO IT COSTS MORE MONEY TO TREAT THE WATER SO IT IS- MAKING CHANGES THAT COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE HEADWATERS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. AND SO- THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE AGAIN- WATERSHED AS A WHOLE THEY NEED TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOSYSTEM RIGHT- RESOURCES AS YOU SEE FROM. THE GRAPHIC IT INCLUDES- READ. SOME RECHARGE BASINS AND MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IT INCLUDES SURFACE AND GROUND STORAGE. IT INCLUDES NEW AND REFURBISHED CONVEYANCE WE- THE FIRST PANEL DISCUSSED. POTENTIAL NEW SURFACE STORAGE. PERSONALITIES AND SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT IS BOTH NEW AND EGGS- REPAIRING EXISTING OR EXPANDING THEM AND STILL FOR EXAMPLE EXPANDING THAT SELLERS RESERVOIR AND THEN POTENTIALLY A NEW- RESERVOIR SET INCLUDES BOTH ALSO WE WILL NEED NEW SURFACE SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANT FACILITIES AS WELL AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES IN MULTIPLE AREAS SO AGAIN IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND IT IS NOT JUST NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IT IS IMPROVING AND OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU SEE FROM THE GRAPHIC ALSO THERE ARE- THE EXCLAMATION MARKS ARE WHERE THERE IS DAMAGE TO OUR CANALS DUE TO SUBSIDENCE SO OUR PLAN AND OUR ESTIMATE ALSO INCLUDES. MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES SO THAT THOSE CANALS CAN TRANSPORT THE WATER THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO. AND SO YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT DOES THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCLUDES SO IT INCLUDES THAT THAT SORRY THE SEVEN BILLION OUT OF THAT SEVEN BILLION FIVE BILLION WOULD GO TO A LOT OF DEBT. INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS GROUNDWATER FACILITIES RECOVERY FACILITIES SURFACE DRINKING WATER FACILITIES CANALS AND THEN THE REST WOULD INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL EXPENSES THAT GO WITH CONSTRUCTION SUCH AS LAND ACQUISITION FACILITY PLANNING DESIGNING SEEKER AND SO ON. AND ALSO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THESE ARE TWO THOUSAND NINE NUMBERS AND- I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT THIS IS MORE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT NINE AT THE MOMENT. AND SO- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEVEN BILLION IS A PRETTY BIG. PRICE TAG EVEN IF IT IS A ONE TIME OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS AND SO WHAT OUR STUDY CONCLUDED IS THAT THE STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CANNOT DO IT ALONE AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD TAKE ALL. OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THIS AND MAKE A AN EFFORT TO DESIGN AND A PLANET TOGETHER AND COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER SO WE BELIEVE THAT. SOME OF THE MONEY SHOULD COME FROM THE STATES SOME FROM THE FEDERAL SOME FROM GREENHOUSE REDUCTION FUND- POTENTIAL WATER SURCHARGES AS WELL AS- A SPECIAL TAX ADD TO THE- TO CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT WOULD. MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE ARE ALL INVOLVED IN IN THIS EFFORT BUT WE ALSO MUST MAKE SURE THAT IT. TO USE AN ANALOGY OF BUILDING A HOME- SO WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A HOME YOU PUT UP A WALL AND YOU LEAVE THE SPACE FOR IT BUT WHERE YOU KNOW A DOOR MIGHT BE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THAT DOOR AT THE MOMENT. YOU'RE PREPARING EVERYTHING AROUND ITFOR WHEN THAT DOOR IS GOING TO BE BUILT SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD NEW INFRASTRUCTURE REFURBISHED WE NEED TO COORDINATE SO WE KNOW THAT. IN THIS WALL THERE WILL BE A DOOR SO THAT WE DON'T BUILD A WALL AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE WALL TO FIT THE DOOR INSTEAD WE'RE COORDINATING ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. A HEY CORD A ONE BIG. EFFORT THAT WORKS TOGETHER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ENTIRE WATERSHED. AND SO HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN OR WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP- SO THE NEXT STEPS ARE PHASE ONE WHICH WOULD JUST INCLUDE PLANNING ORGANIZING AND GOVERNANCE AND IT WOULD BEGIN WITH CREATING A SHARED VISION FOR ST HIKING VALLEY WATER MANAGEMENT. FOLLOWED BY. A PROJECT FINANCING WHICH COULD INCLUDE A BALLOT MEASURE AND THEN THE PHASE THREE WOULD BE THE PROJECT DELIVERY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE- INITIATING FACILITY PLANNING AND PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING EFFORTS. AND SO- SENSE OUR- INITIAL STUDY WE'VE THEN. FORMED A GROUP THAT IS HELPING TO MOVE SOME OF THESE ITEMS FORWARD THERE ARE SOME- EMERGING COLLABORATIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SPECIFIC I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT- THIS ONE AND SO IT CAME FROM AN EFFORT OR A PAPER WRITTEN BY TIM CLAN. AT ABOUT WHAT HE LEARNED IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS OF WORKING IN THE WATER INDUSTRY AND WATER POLICY INSTITUTE CONSISTS OF SOME OF THE HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE AND FACILITATED LEADERSHIP THAT NEEDS TO HAVE FACILITATED LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS BE A COLLABORATION. AND SO- THERE'S AN EMERGING COLLABORATION GOING ON AT THE MOMENT AND IT BEGAN WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM FRESNO STATE STANFORD AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. IT IS CURRENTLY CO CHAIRED BY BUZZ THOMPSON AND ASHLEY SORENSEN AND THE FIRST SESSION INCLUDED OVER FIFTY PARTICIPANTS TODAY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WATER COLLABORATIVE ACTION PROGRAM WHICH I WILL CALL CAP FOR SHORT DURING THIS PRESENTATION. IS MADE UP OF OVER SEVENTY MEMBERS OF WHICH WE ASKED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO BE- AND THE PLANNING GROUP WHICH TODAY INCLUDES OVER TWENTY MEMBERS AND THAT PLANNING GROUP IS THE ONES THAT DO A LOT OF THE INITIAL WRITING REVIEWING. PARTICIPATE IN WORK GROUPS- TO MOVE SOME OF THIS EFFORT FORWARD AND THE PLANETARY GROUP WHICH IS- OVER SEVENTY MEMBERS IS THE FINAL DECISION BODY AND THEN WE HAVE A STEERING GROUP OF NINE MEMBERS WHO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE EFFORT IS MOVING FORWARD FOR PRESIDENT AS SCHEDULED MEETINGS. AND WE HOPE THAT EVERYBODY THAT IS PARTICIPATING IS ABLE TO COME TO A UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS. OF WHAT THE VISION SHOULD BE FOR THE VALLEY AND THE NEXT STEPS- THE CAP STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE SAFE DRINKING WATER ADVOCATES ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS LOCAL GOVERNMENT FODDER FARMERS AND THE AG INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS WATER AGENCIES. I'M SENSE. OF CAP WE'VE CREATED A VISION STATEMENT WHICH STATES THAT WE WILL ENSURE A SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT WATER SUPPLY FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR MULTIPLE BENEFITS BY SECURING A SAFE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO WATER FOR DRINKING. SUSTAINABLE AND PRODUCTIVE FARMS AND RANCHES HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND THRIVING TERRITORIAL TERRA. KERIS DRILL AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS. WE BEGAN THAT AND ARE CLOSE TO BEING DONE WITH THE PHASE ONE ACTION PLAN WHICH INCLUDES A COMMON PROBLEM STATEMENT A COMMON SOLUTION SET AND IT FOCUSED ON A COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED SET OF SOLUTIONS TO TRANSFORM THE BLACK VALLEY TO THE SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. AND SO MMHM THE CAP HAS COMPLETED AND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT IS- HAS FIVE MAIN CATEGORIES WHICH ARE THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT IT. SOME LACK OF ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER THERE'S A DEMAND GAP. THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY. THERE HAS BEEN LOST TO HISTORICAL ECOSYSTEMS HABITATS. THERE IS INADEQUATE PHYSICAL AND NATE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENT LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES ALL OF THE CAUCUSES WHICH ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS AGREE WITH THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE OTHERS. FROM THE DEVELOPING OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT THE FIVE CATEGORIES WE CAME UP WITH FIVE. THE DESIRED OUTCOMES SO WE WOULD LOVE A SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL VALLEY RESIDENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER A SUSTAINABLE WATER SUPPLIES FOR FARMS COMMUNITIES ECO AND ECO SYSTEMS INCREASED FLOOD PLAIN ECOSYSTEM HABITATS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE LOOP THE USE OF LAND IN THE VALLEY. AND THEN THE MORE CONSISTENT LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES AND TO DEVELOP A LIST OF SOLUTIONS WE CREATED FIVE WORKING GROUPS THAT WERE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND WE MADE SURE THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE GROUPS INCLUDED AT LEAST ONE FROM ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THE M. THE WORK GROUPS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH MORE THAN NINETY ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO TRANSFORM THE VALLEY FROM UNSUSTAINABLE TO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND- SO WHAT IS NEXT FOR CAP OR WHAT WILL YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE FOR HIM CAT IS THAT IN MID JANUARY WE'RE GOING TO FINALIZE THE CAP STAYS ONE ACTION REPORT AND HOT HOUSE AND A LOT MORE DETAILED IN MY PRESENTATION TODAY. WHAT THE PROBLEM STATEMENT IS AS WELL AS THE LIST OF NINETY SOLUTION SEPARATED INTO EACH OF THE CATEGORIES N. FEB JANUARY OR FEBRUARY WE WILL CONDUCT MORE OUTREACH EFFORT TO EDUCATE EVERYONE ABOUT THIS EFFORT AND HOW THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR PHASE. TWO IN MARCH WILL LAND SPACE TO WHICH INCLUDES SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS OF SOME PROJECTS AND THEN IN SEPTEMBER COMPLETING A DETAILED PROGRAM. FOR DEMAND REDUCTION AND ADDITIONAL- SURFACE WATER SUPPLY AND HOPEFULLY BY SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY THREE COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE DETAILED SUSTAINABLE ACTION PLAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE IT WAS INFORMATIVE ANSWERED SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND I WILL PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER AND WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS- LATER ON IN THE SESSION. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FLORA AND UP NEXT WE HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE SIR A DOCTOR DOING ALL SIR I APOLOGIZE CHIEF SCIENTIST OF THE EARTH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS A DIRECTOR AT NASA'S JET PROPULSION LABORATORY. PLEASE R. AND I'M SORRY IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. AS I LOOK. IT LOOKS GREAT OKAY MADAM CO CHAIR AND SENATOR BLENDERS FOR POSTING THIS SESSION AND INVITING A GPO PARTICIPATION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MARC SIMARD WILL GO NEXT. WE'RE GONNA TRYING CONVEY THE SORTS OF THINGS THE GPL DOES ON BEHALF OF THE NATION AND THE CALIFORNIAN THE- YOUNGER DUTERTE'S THAT WE'VE TAKEN ON RELATIVE TO TRYING TO DO MORE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND THAT KIND OF CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SO NICELY BY OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THIS COVER SLIDE SHOWS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF ART MUSEUM THAT HIGHLIGHTS ON THE RIGHT YOU KNOW MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD JPL DOES GOES TO MARS AND OTHER PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. WITH GREAT SUCCESS- BUT WE ALSO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO DETAIL ON- CENTER SCIENCE CENTERS APPLICATIONS AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HOST ANY AND ALL OF YOU AT JPL SOMETIME- WHEN THINGS GET BACK TO NORMAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE. TAKE ME UP ON THAT OFFER IN THE MEANTIME OUR PUBLIC. RELATIONS. FOLKS HAVE CREATED A REALLY NICE. VIRTUAL TOUR AND THE THAT RITUAL TO. THERE IN THAT YELLOW. AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH JPL JPL AS ONE OF TEN NASA CENTERS. IT'S OWNED BY NASA AND MANAGED BY CAL TECH. IT'S KNOWN AS A FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER SO- MMHM OUR MAIN MANDATE IS A ROBOTIC EXPLORATION SPACE AND THAT ALSO APPLIES TO- EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND TRYING TO HELP. WITH THE NATION'S CHALLENGES RISK RESPECT- SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS RESEARCHERS THINGS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. THERE ARE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OBJECT ON ANY GIVEN TIME AND ARE THE BUSINESS SPACE IS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF. BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S A LABORATORY SITTING THERE- THANKS TO THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS. IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF PASADENA. SO AS I SAID WE DO A LOT ON BEHALF OF LOOKING A THE EARTH- WE ACTUALLY. SUPPLYING MASTER WITH ABOUT HALF OF THE SATELLITES THAT ARE USED TO OBSERVE THE PLANET- THE OTHER HALF. MOSTLY PROVIDED BY GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT INSTITUTE IN MARYLAND. AND THIS IS JUST A FEW OF THE SNAPSHOTS OF OUR FIRST DOING SATELLITES AND QUANTITIES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY. I'M GONNA JUST START IN THE UPPER LEFT AND GO TO THE RIGHT- THERE ARE A FEW REALLY RELEVANT TO THE DROP CONSIDERATIONS AND OUR CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW FORCING. FUNCTION THAT THAT IS IN. ADDING TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERTAKE SO IN THE UPPER LEFT IS A GLOBAL PICTURE OF. SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE. WHICH WE KNOW HAS BEEN RISING OVER TIME- CARBON DIOXIDE IS ONE. THAT WE NOW HAVE A VERY NICE OBSERVATIONS OF THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THEATMOSPHERE AND HOW IT CHANGES. HOW IT'S CHANGING WITH TIME. AND WE ALL KNOW IS INCREASING WITH TIME BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE FROM SPACE. WE CAN START TO SEEM FAIRLY SMALL EMISSION SOURCES. WITHIN THE STATE WITHIN A CITY. WELL ALMOST NARROWING DOWN TO LARGE FARMS AND FACTORIES TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THAT'S A MISSION THAT'S- WE ACTUALLY. PROTOTYPE THROUGH AIRCRAFT- THROUGH METHANE SURVEYS AND SO FORTH WITHIN THE STATE THAT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT ACTUALLY HELPED DEVELOP INTO A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO PUT. SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS LIKE THAT INTO SPACE IN ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO AND TO HELP MONITOR THE EMISSION SOURCES OUT. OF METHANE IN THAT CASE. CARBON MONOXIDE IS ANOTHER POLLUTANT THAT WE KEEP TRACK OF SOME SPACE- THE ONE IN THE UPPER RIGHT THERE IS THE GRAVITY FIELD AND THAT'S GOING TO COME UP IN A NUMBER OF TIMES BECAUSE- IT'S A REALLY USEFUL MEASURE TO TRACK WATER. AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE PLANET- FROM MELTING ICE SHEETS TO. GROUND WATER AND SO FORTH AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT IN IN IN THE COMING SLIDES AND THEN MARCH PRESENTATION AS WELL. NOW MOVING DOWN TO THE LOWER LEFT WE KNOW ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE'S RISING SEA LEVELS. NASA WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FROM FRANCE AND THE EUROPEAN. SPACE AGENCY HAS DEVELOPED A LONG RECORD OF SPACE BASED SEA LEVEL MEASUREMENTS THAT HELP US TRACK LOCAL. SEA LEVEL RISE. ANOTHER CALL REALLY RELEVANT TO THE DISK SUGGESTS. INSTRUMENTS IN SPACE MONITOR SOIL MOISTURE AND HOW IT CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO RAINFALL OR DROUGHT CONDITIONS. OZONE IS INTERESTING IN THE SENSE THAT- FOR. DECADES AGO WE HELP. INSTRUMENTS IN SPACE THAT HELPED US UNDERSTAND WHY THE OZONE HOLE. WAS CREATED. AND THE REASON I BRING IT UP HERE IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MONTREAL PROTOCOL SOMETHING PUT IN PLACE AND THAT'S INTERNATIONAL SETTING. TO TRY AND REDUCE THE CHEMICALS THAT WERE BEING AMENDED TO. TO PRODUCE AT ALL AND NOW THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BEING USED TO MONITOR THE RECOVERY. AND SO IN THE SAME WAY AT SOME POINT WE'LL WE'LL KEEP TRACKING. WILL KEEP TRACK. OF CARBON WILL PLAY IN THE SAME WAY TO HOPEFULLY. YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE SORT OF MITIGATION- AND REGULATION THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA EXACTLY LEADING THE WAY IN- AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A- WATER RATE REMAINS THERE ON THE RIGHT WHICH IS. IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS WAS A GREENHOUSE GAS ACTUALLY ALONG WITH CARBON DIOXIDE. BUT AS YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO THE FUEL FOR MANY OF THE STORMS AND RAINFALL. THAT WE SEE SO WELL. AND BUSTER WERE POURED INTO. OUR ECONOMY AND SO FORTH. AND SO I'M I'M ALSO HIT ON THAT FACT THAT ALL OF NASA'S PART PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL- FOR MORE AND IT IS AVAILABLE YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES AND APPLIED SCIENCES PURPOSES. BUT THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF GETTING AT IT FROM A MORE LATE PERSPECTIVE. I HIGHLIGHT THE WEBSITE UP THERE AT THE TOP CLIMATE DOT NASA DOT GO WHICH IS A NICE. ENTRY POINTS TO BOTH LEARNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO GET. CERTAIN KINDS OF DATA THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU IN A FORMAT THAT'S RELEVANT TO LOOKING. AT FROM A CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE. ON THAT LAST FIGURE IS THAT WEBSITE IS SEXY ON AWARD WINNING. AWARD WINNING WEBSITE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. ARE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THE WEBBY AWARDS IT'S ACTUALLY GARNERED THREE OR FOUR WHEN THE AWARDS- THAT'S A THAT'S A FANTASTIC SITE. AND AT THE BOTTOM WITH THOSE RED ARROWS YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IT HAS. A SET OF CLIMATE VITAL SIGNS FIRST FIND OUT VITAL SIGNS FROM. WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE GLOBAL CARBON DIOXIDE BURDEN. THE GLOBAL SURFACE TEMPERATURE. HOW WAS THE SEA ICE EXTENT CHANGING IN HIGH LATITUDES. WHAT'S HAPPENING THE ICE SHEETS IN THERE MOSTLY BENCH. MELTING AND IN PREVIOUS DECADE OR SO AND THEN SO MUCH THE C. LEVEL RISE. AND THEN THE FIGURE ON THE RIGHT IS TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT I DIDN'T GIVEN TIME YOU CAN SEE ACTUAL. THE LAST COUPLE DAYS OF ALMOST ANY OF THOSE PARAMETERS I JUST SHOWED YOU ON THAT PREVIOUS PAGE. IT'S A- IT'S AN APPLICATION CALLED EYES ON EARTH YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM YOUR- COMPUTER LAPTOP OR YOU CAN GET IT ON YOUR PHONE. AND YOU COULD LOOK ATFOR EXAMPLE THAT ONE IMAGE THERE SHOWS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SATELLITES ORBITING THE EARTH. YOU CAN PICK ONE N. OR OR PARAMETERS LIKE TEMPERATURE SEA LEVEL. CARBON DIOXIDE AND THEN SEE IT DISPLAYED AS YOU SEE THERE ON THAT COLORFUL IMAGE TO THE RIGHT. AND THAT COULD BE VERY RECENT RIGHT UP TO A GIVEN DATE LIKE AS OF YESTERDAY OR THIS WEEK. SO THERE'S THAT'S THE ENTRY POINT OF MAYBE FINDING. MORE DATA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE GLOBAL GLOBAL VIEWS- EARTH DAY FROM NASA. AND THIS IS JUST IN THE OF WALK THROUGH IT A LITTLE BIT SO BUT WERE WE'RE ALL WE BUSY WORKING ON THE NEXT MEASUREMENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE US GUIDANCE ON BOTH THE SCIENCE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS RESPECT THE EARTH WHICH HAS SOME FIDELITY AND SING DOWN AT A LEVEL OF CALIFORNIA AND REGIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA EVEN CITIES- STARTING ON THE LOWER MIDDLE. THAT'S OKAY OUR NEXT LINE SHE'S GONNA LUNCHEON IN TWO WEEKS- FROM KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IS ACTUALLY UP A SET OF SENSORS THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE AIR FORCE IN THIS CASE IT'S GOING TO GO UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND AND DO BETTER WITH MARINE WEATHER AND EXTREME EXTREME WEATHER THERE- MOVING TO THE LEFT IS A SMALL INSTRUMENT THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE PLACED ON THE SPACE STATION. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO UNDERSTAND DUST SOURCES AROUND THE PLANET- MAINLY DUST CAN INFLUENCE ACTUALLY THE DEVELOPMENTS LAOS AND IT CAN ALSO REFLECT SUNLIGHT BACK TO SPACE IT CAN ALSO BE AN ON AIR QUALITY SOURCE AMERICAN WALLY HAZARDS. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT MACHINE JUST FOR. THAT WAS NEXT BE ABLE ON THE OR WHAT WE REFER TO AS FLAGSHIP MISSIONS THEY'RE VERY BIG MISSIONS THEY HAVE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND THE SUCCESS OF NASA. IN SOMEBODY'S MISSIONS MANAGERS ON REALLY SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS IN THE CASE OF THAT- ITEM CALLED SUAT WHICH STANDS FOR SURFACE WATER AND OCEAN TOPOGRAPHY. IT'S A LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FRENCH SPACE AGENCY AND IT'S DESIGNED. TO ACTUALLY MEASURE FINE SCALE FEATURES OF THE OCEAN SURFACE SITES. BUT MORE PARTICULARLY IT MAKES A HUGE ADVANCE RELATIVE TO PAST MISSIONS LIKE THIS. BECAUSE IT'S GOT FINE ENOUGH SKILLS TO MONITOR LAKE LEVELS AND RIVER LEVELS AND SO AROUND THE GLOBE WE CAN WE CAN GET REALLY S. FIRST MAJOR OF THE GLOBAL AMOUNT OF. WATER AND MEASURE RIVER. RIVER BOUND ELEVATIONS AND MONITOR SLIDES- IT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN IT'S SLATED TO LAUNCH IT SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SPOT MISSION. CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GET INSIGHTS INTO. LAKES AND RIVERS THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE. THAT NICER MISSION WITH THAT BIG AND- IS GOING TO BE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT'S VIBRATION WITH THE INDIAN SPACE AGENCY- IT HAS A LOT OF APPLICABILITY AND MARK'S GONNA TALK. QUITE A BIT ABOUT WHAT A MISSION LIKE THIS CAN DO IN TERMS OF- I THINK FROM WHAT. I MEAN THIS NATIONAL HELP WITH ALL KINDS OF HAZARDS AND THAT'S WHAT'S MARKED AND TALK ABOUT IT ALSO HELP US MONITOR THE ICE SHEETS AND KEEP TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF BIOMASS- WHICH IS RELEVANT TO YOU KNOW. UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON EMITTED AND THE SINK. OF CARBON IN IN THE LAND SURFACE SO MARKLE HIT ON THAT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HAZARDS LIKE SUBSTANCE AND THOSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO GREAT DROUGHT AND GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION. MAYA THE MISSION THERE IS RELATED IS. IS A REALLY UNIQUE MISSION CALIFORNIA PLAYS A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS- MY AS A MISSION TO STUDY. ERA SOULS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEIR IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY AND THE AND THEN TURN ON PUBLIC HEALTH. THE MISSION TEAM IS COMPOSED OF BOTH. AIR QUALITY SCIENCES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. SCIENCES AND IT'S GOING TO. IT'S DESIGNED TO STUDY THE AIR QUALITY ON BIRTH OUTCOMES. AND CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS A NUMBER OF STATIONS THAT WILL PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING HELPING THOSE TEAMS TAKE TAKE ON THAT SEVEN. OTHERS ANOTHER MISSION THAT'S A VERY KIND OF HIGH AND VERY DETAILED SCIENCE QUESTION RELATED TO HIGH LATITUDES OF NIGHT SHOOTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN THAT LAST ONE. CURRENT CONCERNING SEA LEVEL IS JUST THE LAST OR THE MOST RECENT ADDITION TO THAT LONG STANDING LINE AT SEA LEVEL MISSIONS TO HELP US MONITOR HOUSE THE LEVEL IS CHANGING AROUND THE GLOBE AND THAT'S- AGAIN THAT IT'S PART OF A VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP WITH. FRIGID SPACE AGENCY AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING. US BUSY A LOT AT JPL- IN COULD JUST ON THIS IS A DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS. A SATELLITE OBSERVATION I MENTION THAT GRAVITY MISSION- WE REFER TO IT AS GRACE AND THEN THE FOLLOWING GRACE FOLLOW ON. AND IT HELPS US MEASURE AND KEEP TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER ON WHITE. AND SO IT IT ADDS UP. IT IS ABLE TO ADD TOGETHER ALL THE GRAMMAR GROUNDWATER SURFACE WATER AND SNOW PACK AND JUST GIVE HIM AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT- WHAT THE LANDSCAPE HAS IN TERMS OF. WATER STORAGE AND THIS IS THE TIME SERIES SINCE THE FIRST. LAUNCH OF THE FIRST RACE MISSION STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND BLUE COLORS ARE SHOWING PERIODS WHERE THE WATER. THE WATER IS SORT OF EXTRA ABOVE NORMAL RELATIVE TO THAT TIME PERIOD. AND THE RED IS SHOWING SORT OF OUR DROUGHT TEN FOLLOWING WHAT- NICELY AS CINDY AND RACHEL PROVIDED SOME BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE WE JUST WENT THROUGH THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN GROUND EVERYTHING TURNED RED. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO LAND ON A PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT READ PERIOD WHICH IS A YOU KNOW A VERY STRONG DROP AND THE NUMBERS THERE IT'S FAIR IN TERMS OF MILLIMETERS SO OVER THIS LARGE LANDSCAPE. YOU KNOW THESE REGIONS ARE JUST DEFICIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF WATER THROUGH THOSE LAYERS UP GROUNDWATER SURFACE WATER AND STILL BACKED BY THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT A- THIRD OF A METER. AND SO MOVING ON ON THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS A MORE OF A CLOSED DOOR GETTING MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE DO RELATIVES ARE WATER RELATED RESOURCES OBSERVATIONS THAT MAY THE BULLS HELP US CARRY OUT SCIENCE AND UNDERSTAND CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER THINGS THAT AFFECT CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF WEATHER AND OTHER HAZARDS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES IN MANY CASES INFORMATION TO HELP US START TO PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT FOR FOLKS LIKE YOU IN THIS ROOM- JUST AND A LOT OF NEPHEW WITH THESE. ARE PART AND PARCEL OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE COLLABORATION AND PROVIDE DATA FOR SOME CASES OF SERVING UP TO NEW YORK YOUR DECISION MAKING AGENCIES STARTING AT THE UPPER LEFT. WE ACTUALLY STUDY- EXTREME STORMS AND RAIN FALLING ANOTHER ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS ARE A BIG PART OF THAT THAT IMPACT THE WEST COAST. AND WE- STUDY THOSE RIVERS AND HOW THEY'D CHANGE WITH TIME CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED THINGS AND ALSO YOU MENTIONED BEFORE DELIVERY ARE AND THEIR FOCUS ON. FORECASTING AND TRYING TO DO THE MOST ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH JEAN JONES FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND TRYING TO IMPROVE. SUB SEASONAL AND SEASONAL FORECASTING EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DECISION MAKING IT SIR REALLY OUR PROBLEM- THERE IN THE MIDDLE IS SIERRA SNOWPACK AND WE HAVE MEASURES OF- BILLY BEANE. YES HI FIDELITY MEASURES OF SNOW BACK YOU KNOW THEY GO OUT BUT HOLD. ON A FEW PLACES AND TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE TOTAL SNOW PACK IS OVER A PLACE LIKE THIS- TRYING TO REMEMBER THE NAMES FOLLOWING BASIN- AND WITH SO THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO THAT WE ARE WE NORMALLY ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF SNOW IN A REGION LIKE THAT THIS BIG WATERSHED BASIN. USING UP ALL AND YOU KNOW DOZENS OF POINTS THROUGH. REMOTE SENSING- BASED ON A ON AN ON AN AIRCRAFT WE CAN GET IN THE SYSTEM AND OF THE ENTIRE WATERSHED AND THE AMOUNT OF SNOW IN THAT WATER SHOULD PRETTY PRETTY EFFECTIVELY AND- NASA IS WORKING HARD ON THE NEXT SOLICITATION TO TRY AND DEVELOP A SPACEBORNE MEASUREMENTS. THAT WOULD WORK AS EFFECTIVELY INSTANCE. I'M ON THE RIGHT IS THIS CENTRAL GROUND. SHE'S FINE I SHOWED YOU THAT IN THE LAST ANIMATION SO I WILL GO OVER THAT DETAIL. THAT BIG RADAR MISSION THAT I MENTIONED- NICE EITHER WHICH IS THE CALIBRATION WITH THE INDIANS THERE ARE A FEW- MEASUREMENTS LIKE THAT IN SPACE AND THAT ARE ALSO FLOWN ON AIRCRAFT. THE MAP ON THE LOWER LEFT IS USING DATA LIKE THAT FOR HAZARD RESPONSE IN THIS CASE IT'S DETECTING WHERE THE SERVICE IS FLOODED IN THOSE REGIONS- AND THERE'S A RESPONSE PRODUCTS. PRODUCED BY SOMETHING WE CALL ARIA BUT USED BY CALIFORNIA AND OTHER NASH STATE AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRY IN THE NATION TO HELP- INFORMS LIKE RESPONSE ALL THE WAY FROM NOT ONLY FLIGHTS THAT FLOODS EARTHQUAKES. FIRES. AND SO FORTUNATELY IS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN THE BOTTOM WE HAVE A SATELLITE- A SENSOR ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THAT IS USED TO MEASURE- PLANT WATER USE IT. IN SS IS BASED ON HOW WARM AND HOT WITH THE PLANTS ARE JUST JUST HOW MUCH WATER IT NEEDS AND HOW MUCH STRESS IS UNDERTAKING AND YOU CAN SEE. THAT IT HAS A FIDELITY TO ALMOST SEE FARM LEVEL FARM SIZE LAW. AND UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WATER IS BEING USED FROM A FARMING PERSPECTIVE WE REFER TO THAT AS A BACKWARD TRANSPIRATION IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT TERM. FINALLY ON THE RIGHT. IS SOMETHING REFERRED TO AS BROWN SUBSTANCE YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT WHEN YOU EXTRACT GROUNDWATER AND YOU EXTRACT ENOUGH OF IT THE GROUND CAN ACTUALLY SING. AND THAT'S A MEASURE OF SOMEONE THAT SINKING IN MARK'S GONNA TALK ABOUT. THAT MUCH MORE DETAIL IN THE STOCK. SO THIS LAST TIME IT IS JUST A HIGHLIGHT THAT- FROM SERVING NASCENT AND THAT'S- DETAILS PRIMARY MISSION ABOUT 90% OF OUR WORK IS DIRECTLY TO DO THAT NASSAR RELATED WORK WHETHER IT'S PLANETARY OR SCIENCE THE SORT OF THING I'M SHOWING YOU HERE WITH THE SATELLITES- ABOUT 10% OF OUR WORK IS WITH NON ASSET AGENCIES INCLUDING. CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD SOME VERY EFFECTIVE COLLABORATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA. ON THE LEFT THERE IN THE PAST AND CURRENT. ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN. REALLY SUCCESSFUL I THINK TO A GREAT DEGREE WITH CALIFORNIA AGENCIES YOU SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT THERE'S THAT REGIONAL METHANE SURVEY THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER- THE FORECASTING THAT I ALSO MENTION IN RELATION TO ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS IN SEASONAL DROUGHTS. CENTRAL VALLEY SUBSTANCES ON AS A PROJECT THAT WAS CONNECTED WITH. WHEN THE WATER RESOURCES THE AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND THAT MY AMBITION I TALKED ABOUT THAT'S RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES ZERO WATER SNOW PACK AND RELATED TO THAT- SUBSTANCES LEVY INTEGRITY MONITORING WHICH MARK IS GOING TO COVER IN MORE DETAIL AND THAT'S THAT THINKS THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THEY STIRRED UP BY. NASA WESTERN WATER APPLICATIONS OFFICE. TO TRY AND INFUSE NASA DATING CAPABILITIES MORSE MORE- CHANCE OF LATE INTO INTO WESTERN WATER STAKEHOLDERS AND DECISION MAKERS HANSON SO THAT'S HOW'S THE GPL AND THERE'S ALWAYS ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO THAT KIND OF A AN APPLIED SCIENCE BASIS AND TRYING TO BRING DATA. TO DECISION MAKING SO WE HAVE THESE LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE AGENCIES ON THE RIGHT AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT SOME OF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT GOING FORWARD AT JPL AND CALIFORNIA SIGNED A MEMO YOU ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO- SPECIFICALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. CAL EPA AND CALIFORNIA FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES AND MOVED IN THE FUTURE AND HELP WITH THE KIND OF PROBLEMS WITH FOR TODAY AND WITH THAT I'M. GONNA MOVE. ON MARK DO YOU WANT TO SHOW YOU SLIDES ARE YOU WANT ME TO- I WILL DO IT. OKAY ALL AND ALL AT THIS POINT I'LL GO AHEADAND INTRODUCE- MARK SIMMERED DUCK DOCTOR MARK SIMMERED PRINCIPAL SCIENTIST ALSO FROM THE NASA JET PROPULSION LABORATORY. WELCOME MARK. THANK YOU MY FIRST SLIDE HERE- WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU- AND- SO I WILL MAYBE GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILS ON OUR WAY TO DOING WHAT IS FOR MY COLLEAGUE JUST THE- I WENT TO- SOAK. IN IN ADDITION TO ALL THAT NOW THEY CAN DO FROM SPACE WE CAN ALSO DO THINGS- FROM THE AIR MOST OF THE SATELLITES AND INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU SEE. THAT WILL BE LAUNCHED TO SPACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED ON THE AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS FOR TESTING AND ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR STUDYING THE LANDSCAPES AND THE WATER. SO SO THE TITLE YOU'RE TALK IS THE FOLLOWING TO WATER SO I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE RESERVATIONS OF. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA AND- CENTRAL BODY SO I'M A PRINCIPAL SCIENTIST ALSO LEAD DOES NOT EXIST DELTA X. THE MISSION WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN. A CAMPAIGN WITH AIRCRAFTS. IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA. SO A HERE I'M SHOWING YO THE PART OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA- WEEKENDS FOLLOW. THE LAND LOST USING TIME SERIES OF SATELLITES. THE NEW LET ME MENTION HERE SHOWS LOSS OF LAND IN RED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT SOME PARTS OF THE DELTA OR LOSING LAND WHILE OTHERS ARE GAINING LAND THAT SO THOSE ARE THE ONES IN THE WEST THE GREEN PARK. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOSS OF LAND IN THIS AREA. NO COASTAL LOUISIANA. IT'S A QUIVER LAND TO LOSING THAT. ONE FOOTBALL FIELD EVERY SINGLE HOUR SO THERE'S A LOT OF LAND THAT IS BEING LOST IN THAT REGION AND THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IN THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN. DELTA BUT- IN THE INTEREST OF- NOW UNDERSTANDING THE HOLLIES DEALT US CAN'T KEEP UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE- I'M GOING TO JUST SHOW YOU THIS LITTLE ANIMATION HERE SO THERE ARE TWO PERSON SEES BY WHICH DEALT US CAN KEEP UP WITH THE SEA LEVEL RISE SO WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DELTAS RIGHT THAT NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BAD THAT. SOMEONE CAME BY THE END OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA SO THERE ARE TWO PROCESSES BY WHICH THE KEEP UP WITH C. LEVEL RISE THE FIRST ONE IS THROUGH A SENTIMENT THAT THE POSITION SO THE REVERSE COME DOWN FROM THE WATERSHED. AND THE DEPOSIT SENTIMENTS AT ITS MACH THIS BUILDS SOIL AND THAT WE CAN KEEP UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE BUT ON THIS MOST OF THE TIME IS NOT SUFFICIENT. SOME OF THE OTHER A PROCESS BY WHICH YOU CAN GAIN LAND ELEVATION TO KEEP UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE IS THROUGH THE PLANT AND PRODUCTION SO THE PLANTS OF COURSE. GREW THESE ROOTS IN THE GROUND- THE- THE SENATE SIDE THERE IN THE FALL THEY DIE AND ALL THIS MATERIAL ACCUMULATES ON THE GROUND AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO ELEVATING THE SOUL AND KEEP UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE SO THESE ARE THE TWO PROCESSES BY WHICH A NATURAL. ADULT BAG SYSTEM. CAN SURVIVE TO ARISE. SO OKAY THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA OF COURSE HAS A LOT OF WATER- SO THIS MAP HERE- WEST'S- NOW GENERATED USING THE GRACE THAT A SYSTEM WHICH IS THE ONE THAT THE- DOING IT INTRODUCED EARLIER SO. IT BASICALLY MEASURES. THE MASS THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AROUND THE PLANET AND YOU CAN SEE HERE IN BLUE THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA AND ITS WATERSHED IS FULL OF WATER WHICH IS KIND OF. CONTRASTING TO WHAT WE FIND OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ARE LOSING WATER RIGHT BUT THE SIMILARITY IN THESE TWO SYSTEMS IS THE NEED. FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOURCES RIGHT SO WE CAN OBSERVE ALL OF THIS STUFF FROM SPACE AND HEAR WHAT I'M DISCUSSING OR INTRODUCING TO YOU ARE WAYS. TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS THAT. WITH THE USE OF SATELLITE AS WELL AS YOU WERE BORN OR AIRCRAFT THE. REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES. SO IT IT ALSO SHOWED THIS WAS IN A MUCH SMALLER IMAGE BUT HERE WE ARE SHOWING THE LOSS OF WATER IN THE AREAS OF ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. SO THE GREEN- GOING TO THE RED INDICATES THE LOSS OF WATER SO AGAIN THIS IS FROM THE GRACE MISSION. SO THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT IS SHOWN HERE AND THAT IS BEING LOST THROUGH THE YEARS. IS DETECTED FROM THE WEIGHT OF THAT WATER SO IT'S A DIFFERENCE IN GRAVITY. THAT WE'RE MEASURING FROM SPACE SO WE CAN DO THIS FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE PLANET AND THIS IS THAT YOU WERE SHOWING ONLY CALIFORNIA WHICH IS LOSING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER. AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND DISSECTING OR. SO I THINK MY POSITION IS SLIGHTLY HEAVY SO- IT TAKES AWHILE FOR ME TO SWITCH THE SIDES- SO. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOSE WATER THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THERE ARE A- IT HAS IMPACTS ON THE LAND AND- WE CAN OBSERVE THAT FROM SPACE AND IT WAS ALSO. A NEW DID BY- DOING WANT TO SERVE BUT ALSO- YOU'RE BIASED CINDY MESSER. SO HERE IS A MAP OF THE LARGE FIGURE THAT YOU SEE HERE WITH THE COLORS IS A MAP OF GROUND SUBSIDENCE. AND DE COLORS THAT YOU SEE GO FROM ABOUT THE BLUE TO RED WHERE RED INDICATES SUBSIDENCE. WITH RATES OF ABOUT ALMOST ONE FOOT PER YEAR. SO THESE ARE HUGE SUBSIDENCE RATES SO THE GROUND IS BASICALLY GOING DOWN. SO THE HOUSE THAT HAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT REPERCUSSION ON INFRASTRUCTURE- LADIES AS WELL AS THE BACK WINDOW. IN FACT- BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE WATER FLOWS DOWN THE RIVER IT FLOWS DOWN THE SLOPES SO IF YOU CHANGE THAT SMOKE. YOU WILL ALSO CHANGE THE FLOW OF WATER SO IT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES AND WE CAN OBSERVE THAT. EXTREMELY ACCURATELY FROM SPACE AS WELL AS WITH OUR SPACE BORNE INSTRUMENTS. AND ALSO I JUST WANTED TO. YOU USED TO KNOW THAT THE DISTRICT KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ACTUALLY. BEEN I GUESS ACCEPTED BY. THAT AND THE CALIFORNIA'S GROUNDWATER LIFE THAT- CINDY MESSER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ACTUALLY HAS A MAP BOTH FROM SUBSIDENCE THAT ON IT'S A GREAT SITE. SO I DID NOT MENTION SO IT HAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE- SUBSIDENCE HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES- IN PARTICULAR- I QUIT SO HERE WITH OUR INSTRUMENT THE U. S. R. WHICH IS INSTALLED ON AN AIRPLANE- WE COVERED THE- CALIFORNIA I COULD LOOK. SEVERAL TIMES AND HERE'S ONE OF THE IMAGES THAT WERE RETRIEVED HER FROM THIS ERA CROPS SHOWING AGAIN SUBSIDENCE SO BECAUSE IT IS AN AIRCRAFT IT'S NOT ONLY GET ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA. BUT IT'S ALSO ON THE MEND- SO YOU WE CAN FLY AT ANY TIME SO WE DECIDED TO LIVE TO BE DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE OR THE- THE REPEAT OF THE MEASUREMENT IT CAN CAN BE FOR US A MONTH FOR A YEAR SO WE DEMOCRATS IT'S REALLY- WEEKEND THAT IT'S ON DEMAND- REMOTE SENSING THAT. WE CAN ACHIEVE SO HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE SUBSIDENCE MEASUREMENTS- THAT- WE- CAPTURED. THIS IS BETWEEN- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO QUITE AWHILE ALREADY. AND THAT IT SHOWS THAT ONE OF THESE A SMALLER AREA- SMALL AREAS WHICH IS JUST ALONG. THE AQUEDUCT. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE UPWARD UP IN THIS AREA IN PARTICULAR IS UNDERGOING- SUBSIDENCE RATES. OF NEARLY ONE. ONE FOOT IN THAT YEARS SO THIS IS A- COURTING TO MONITOR BECAUSE IN FACT IT WILL IMPACT THE SLOPE OF THAT THAT PRODUCT AND THEREFORE TO SLOW WATER. OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO WITH- OUR AIRBORNE REMOTE SENSING INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE SPACEBORNE ONES. IS TO MONITOR THE HEALTH OF LADIES THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE IN THE SUMMER CAME AND I SUBMIT TO SOME WORK IN DELTA. AND BC IS THE INSURER ON SHERMAN ISLAND SO WE HAVE OBSERVED USING THIS UAV SUBSYSTEM AGAIN. BREACH IN THE LEVEE- WHICH WAS DETECTED DRESSER FROM- DEED TO SUSPECT MOTOR G. THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE- AND AGAIN THIS IS SO THIS ONE IS FROM. AN AIRCRAFT AND WE CAN. ALSO DO THAT NOT FROM SPACE. AS WE KNOW SO MANY. WE CAN LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE LANDSCAPE DON'T IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF WATER. UNDERGROUND WATER IN ON THE LANDSCAPE BUT WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT D. S. STORAGE FOR WATER IN OUR- SNOW PACKS AND MOUNTAINS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT- WE'RE SHOWN BY DOING EARLIER. BUT BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND OF THE JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY TO THE POINT FROM. THAT ABOUT THIRTY CENTIMETERS OVER THE WEEK TO. ABOUT. A METRE OF SNOW HERE SO- THIS IS ONE OF- THE EXAMPLES THAT BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALSO DO. WITH AIRCRAFT MEASUREMENTS. BUT SOON WILL HAVE THREE MISSIONS THAT MIGHT BE LAUNCHED- THAT WILL FACILITATE MEASUREMENTS OF FLOWS OF WATER GLOBALLY AND- WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLY THESE SEVEN EWE MEASUREMENTS TO CALIFORNIA- WATER RIVER. WATER MANAGEMENT SO- SWALLOW THE SURFACE WATER AND OCEAN TOPOGRAPHY WHICH IS- SHOWN HERE AS AN ANIMATION WILL BE LAUNCHED NEXT YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WOULD PROVIDE. NOT ONLY WATER SURFACE ELEVATION OF THE SEA BUT IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE US WITH THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING A MEASUREMENT. OF REFURBISHED CHARGE. AND ALSO- PROVIDED A WEEK TO MONITOR ALL THE HYDROLOGY ALONG THE COAST ITSELF. AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN RESERVOIRS AND LAKES SO- DAN THIS IS GLOBAL BUT OF COURSE IT DEFINITELY WORKS IN CALIFORNIA ITS SECOND MISSION HERE WHICH WILL BE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS MY SORRY- THAT IS THE ONE THAT'S BEING. BUILT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INDIAN SPACE AGENCY. AND WITH THIS MISSION WE WILL BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE FLOW OF WATER. UNDER THE VEGETATION. SO THIS IS ONE OF THE- THE- MEASUREMENTS THAT HAS NOT BEEN. EXTENSIVELY USED YET NOR FOR SCIENCE OR FOR APPLICATIONS FOR THE WATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE I SEE A GREAT POTENTIAL IN THIS MISSION HERE THE- OTHER- THE MEASUREMENT WILL THIS MISSION WOULD PROVIDE. IS GROUND SUBSIDENCE SO IT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GROUND SUBSIDENCE AGAIN HOPEFULLY. AND THIS ONE WILL PROVIDE US OF COURSE AND ALL THE DATA WOULD BE FREE AS THE WIND SAID EARLIER AND WE PROVIDE RADIUS- YES VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER RESOURCES THE LAST MISSION HERE IS B. G. WHICH STANDS FOR SIR FIRST BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH- IS MOST LIKELY A LONG STAY IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT AND MAYBE LATER. AND THIS ONE WOULD PROVIDE MEASUREMENTS OF WATER QUALITY IN ADDITION TO ENABLING- MONITORING. OF THE HEALTH OF VEGETATION. SO I WILL STOP HERE I WILL LEAVE YOU AND THIS ANIMATION AND THE- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. FULL THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO I IT JUST. THIS IS AN AREA THAT- JUST REALLY I'M PERSONALLY REALLY INTERESTED AND I THINK THAT IT IS A HUMAN SECURITY ISSUE IT'S A- OUR- CLEAN WATER ISSUE IT IS A FOOD ISSUE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND- THE FASCINATED BY THE WORK THEY IF IT YOU'RE ALL DOING AND ALSO THE WORK THAT. IS THAT YOU. LOOKING AHEAD OF US AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT- FRESNO STATE AND THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS. COLLABORATORS WITH FRESNO STATE AND ALONG WITH AT NASA. I- I HAVE IN DISTRICT I THINK. NOT TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN AND OF A SENSE OF WHAT NASA. IN TERMS OF SUBSIDENCE AND IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF DELTA'S. WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU KNOW. THAT WE DON'T KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT AROUND THE WORLD IN OTHER ARTS OF THE US AND CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN REPORTS ABOUT SUBSIDENCE OCCURRING. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE LOOKING INTO THAT ARE AT A GLOBAL SCALE. BUT I MEAN WHAT IS IT THAT THAT KIND AND- WHAT QUESTIONS ARE NOT HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED YET IN TERMS OF SUBSIDENCE IN TERMS OF- THE FUTURE OF DELTAS WHAT WHAT. ARE WE LOOKING AT WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT. YEAH I DON'T MAYBE I START SO I- LAURA MENTIONED THAT EARLIER WE NEED TO HAVE A COORDINATED A WAY OF MANAGING THE RESOURCES- THE WATER RESOURCES IN THIS CASE. AND- WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND REALLY IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ALL OF THE D. DISPOSAL WHICH IS THE LANDSCAPE RIGHT SO WE GO FROM THE UPPER WATERSHED ALL THE WAY. TO THE CITY. AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS SEES WHICH- ARE DUE TO IT BEING A- ACTIVITY OF- HUMAN. AT ALL THE WAY TO A GEORGE COLLECTIVITIES- BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES SO WHEN'S THE INTERACTION. OF THE WATER WITH THE- LANDSCAPE BASEL BUT I THINK WE STILL DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND OR- ACTIVITIES THAT QUANTITATIVELY WE HAVEN'T YET QUANTIFIED EVERYTHING THERE AND I THINK NOW WITH THESE TOOLS THAT. YEAH WE HAVE- IT'S POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS THIS- THIS GAP IN KNOLEDGE. BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE THIS THIS VERY LARGE SCALE VIEW- WE USED TO HAVE JUST A LITTLE GAUGE A LITTLE WATER LEVEL GAUGE HERE ANOTHER ONE THERE BUT NOW WE SEE EVERYTHING WE SEE THE CONNECTION- ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WATER SEAS OR THAT I THINK ONLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AND- WE- HAVE A COORDINATED MODEL CAN WE UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. R. S. AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I ACTUALLY- BECAUSE REALLY BECAME AWARE AND FASCINATED LIKE YOU WERE RECENTLY QUOTED AND- IT COULD BE A P. ST AND ASSOCIATED PRESS AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING I DISCOURAGED TO KNOW FROM YOU- KIND OF A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT YOU MEAN BY IT BUT YOU SAID. IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SAVING AN AREA LOSING ANOTHER INSTEAD OF LOSING EVERYTHING HE WANT TO KNOW WHERE-TO PUT YOUR RESOURCES TO WORK TO SAVE THE LIVELIHOOD. OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE AND- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THIS COMMITTEE I MEAN IT THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGHT IT'S ABOUT HUMAN SECURITY IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE LIVELIHOOD OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE AND- WHAT. YOU KNOW NOT JUST THAT THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT BUT ALL CALIFORNIANS IN PURE BILLY PEOPLE ACROSS. IT JUST AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT OBVIOUSLY CLIMATE CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST IMPACTING MY SENATE DISTRICT IT'S IMPACTING MANKIND ANYTHING- ELSE THE TWO- A DOCTOR SUMMER ONE TO KIND OF ADD TO THE QUOTE THAT YOU PROVIDED. YEAH I DIDN'T DO THAT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD ENCAPSULATE MOST OF MY THOUGHTS HERE. IT'S REALLY THE WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT. OF HUMAN ACTIVITY AND ALSO THE FEEDBACK OF NATURE ON THAT YOU MEANT ACTIVITY SO WHEN YOU LOSE- SOMETHING IN A LANDSCAPE BE PROCESSED YOU ALSO LOSE OR ENDANGERED OR THREATENED ALIVE YOU. WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT THAT AND WE I THINK WE CANNOT. TALK ABOUT THE DELTAS AND VALLEYS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE- THE AVARICE IN A ROW IN THERE AND THEY ARE IMPACTED BY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. SO AGAIN MY- CITING LAURA- WITH THE COSTS YOU KNOW SEVEN SEVEN BILLION SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECIDES TO GIVE US FIVE BILLION AND THAT'S SEVEN. WHAT DO YOU DO SO HOW DO YOU OPTIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO MOST PEOPLE. BEFORE I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF U. S. MAIS BENEFITS SO THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY MY BUSINESS I PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT- I HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE. CAN BE USED TO MAKE S. N. O. SMARTER DECISIONS AND MORE- YOU KNOW OPTIMIZE SPEED THAT IS. YOUR RESOURCES I USE THAT FIVE MINUTES FIVE BILLION. IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AND- THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND ARE ALL ALL. THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL I KNOW THAT WE- HAVE UP WITH SOME PEOPLE WAITING IN THE QUEUE FOR WORK BACK FOR COMMENTS. FOR THIS HEARING AND SO I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP TO A PUB PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO THANK YOU THAT'S ONE THING THE THIRD PANEL ONCE AGAIN FOR JOINING US FOR ALL THE INFORMATION AND- I WILL TAKE UP- YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER AT SOME POINT WHEN IT IS- ALLOWED AND SAFE TO DO SO TO. TO GO FOR A VISIT- TO YOUR STATION AND- I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT EXPLORATIONS THAT ARE UPCOMING THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESEARCH THAT YOU'RE DOING AND IN REGARDS TO. PROTECTING HUMANS AND- MAKING SURE WE EAT THERE IS HUMAN SECURITY FOR ALL SO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND I'LL GO AHEAD AT THIS POINT OPEN IT UP TO- UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. IN LATE IN GERMAN ON THE PHONE LINE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. NOT VERY WILL PROVIDE YOU A NUMBER. AND I WILL ANNOUNCE YOU BY THAT NUMBER. ONCE AGAIN DID LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.

AND WE'LL START WITH THE LINE NUMBER TWELVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I LEARNED HOW CAN I BE HEARD- IN A DROUGHT COMMITTEE. TROUBLE CALLING IN YES THIS IS ACUMEN SECURITY- LOOKING GREAT- GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TAKING COMMENT YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW THE COURT HEARING THEY DIDN'T HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT- I WAS HEARING THEY DIDN'T TAKE PHONE COMMENT LEARNING ON DOLLARS SHE- GETS COMMENTS. I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING COMMENT- THAT BEING SAID READING FROM- CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE BY A KEY CRIMES FROM DECEMBER SIXTH. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SQUANDERING ITS PRECIOUS WATER. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED SEVEN POINT ONE TWO BILLION IN BONDS FOR STATE WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. I'M NOT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION WAS DESIGNATED FOR WATER STORAGE PROJECTS. BUT NEARLY EIGHT YEARS LATER THERE ARE NO NEW DAMS OR RESERVOIRS OR OTHER WATER PROJECT. WHAT'S IN STORE CALIFORNIA'S WINTER RUNOFF IN CALIFORNIA IS IN YET ANOTHER DROUGHT. THE STATE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE BOW TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS BY ALLOWING HALF OF THE STATE'S WATER TO FLOW OUT TO THE OCEAN LEAVING FARMERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGHT FOR THE OTHER FIFTY PERCENT. THE STATE USES ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF IT THE LOCAL WATER SUPPLY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING WILD RIVER FLOWS MANAGED WETLAND. AND WILDLIFE PRESERVE HABITAT AND WATER QUALITY CONTROL FOR FISH AND REQUIRED TO DELTA OUTFLOWS ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. WATER IS DIVERTED IN TIMES OF DROUGHT TEN TIMES OF PLENTY TO THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA LEAVING MUCH LESSER IRRIGATION OVER CALIFORNIA TO DRINK APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE REMAINING WATER IS USED BY CITIES AND 40% USED BY AGRICULTURE. YET IT IS ALWAYS URBAN USE AND AGRICULTURE FORCED YOU CONCERN. IS WHY THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS WRITTEN AND HAS BEGUN TO QUALIFY AS A STATE BALLOT PROPOSITION MORE WATER NOW AS IT IS KNOWN WILL BE A BIPARTISAN PARTISAN INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SINCE YOUR TWO THOUSAND. CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE APPROVED A WATER BONDS TOTALING MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT THE STATE BUREAUCRATS EMPOWERED TO GET THESE PROJECTS HELLO. I HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND LOOK FOR TO GAUGE AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS FROM DOZENS OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES INSTEAD THE SUCCESSFUL BUREAUCRATS KEEP THEIR JOBS BY CONDITIONING PEOPLE TO THINK THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS TO BUILD A RESERVOIR OR REPAIRING AQUEDUCT ONE WATER EXPERT TOLD THE GLOBE. THEY'RE DEAD WRONG. BUT THEY ARE IN CHARGE. WATER MEAN MORE WHAT BILL FOR WHAT. MORE WATER OF THE FOR THE DELTA ECO SO AND MORE. TO MANAGE CHRONIC DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE MORE WATER NOW SAYS. AND TO STATE WHAT OUGHT TO BE OBVIOUS MORE WATER PROJECTS ALSO MEANS LESS IMPORTED FOOD AND MORE AFFORDABLE FOOD. L. U.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIN I'VE BEEN HERE DONE AND I'M REPRESENTING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT. WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS VALLEY WATER. VALLEY WATER FACES A CHALLENGE WITH WATER AFFORDABILITY FUTURE CONFERENCE THE CALL. IS NOT INCLUDED. CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT THAT'S MAKING URGENT THE NEED FOR A CLAIM FOR A LOSS THE IRISH NO BLACKS. NO PACKED WITH MORE COSTLY IN COUNTY STORAGE. SECONDLY HIGH COST RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE WATER I'M MORE RESILIENT WITH THEM OR IN DROUGHT INDUCED COST OF EMERGENCY WATER TRANSFERS AND THE EXHILARATION OF CONSERVATION PROGRAM. THAT STATE AND FEDERAL WATER CONVEYANCES ARE COSTLY TO REPAIR AND SUBJECT OUTAGES AND FAMILY REGULATORY DELAYS THAT CAN INFLATE THE COST OF WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THESE COSTS ARE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE STILL HIGH FOR A WATER DISTRICT RATEPAYERS IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS HE JUST THERE ON THEIR OWN. SOME OF THE LARGEST POPULATIONS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIVE IN MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS. WHERE WATER AFFORDABILITY IS BECOMING A SERIOUS CHALLENGE.
