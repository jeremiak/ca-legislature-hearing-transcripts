YOU COLLEAGUES.

FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY I

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:58.283
APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU AND YOUR

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.017
DEEP CONSIDERATION OF THESE

00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:00.552
ISSUES AND LET ME START WITH THE

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:01.586
FOLLOWING.

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:02.887
EVERYONE OF US IN THIS ROOM KNOW

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:04.789
THAT IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS TIME

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:07.092
IN HISTORY IT'S ALMOST A CLICHE

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:08.293
TO SAY THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.794
OF A HOUSING CRISIS.

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:10.929
THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.430
STATE'S HISTORY.

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:13.832
BUT WE ARE.

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:15.533
WE'RE NOT ONLY A HOUSING CRISIS

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.202
WHEN HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:19.170
AND WHEN ATTENDED CRISIS AND

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.505
INNOVATION CRISIS.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.108
MOST OF CALIFORNIANS SEVENTEEN

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.809
MILLION TENANTS DO NOT HAVE SAFE

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:26.578
SECURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:27.979
WE HAVE MILLIONS OF TENANTS WERE

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:29.647
ONE RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM

00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:30.248
BEING ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.649
TABLE.

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:33.885
GET HEALTH CARE OR AT THE RISK

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:35.286
OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:37.088
I OFTEN SAY THAT THE WAY OUT OF

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.857
THIS PROBLEM REQUIRES THE THREE

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.792
PIECE THAT WE NEED TO PRODUCE A

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:41.826
LOT MORE HOUSING.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:42.894
PRESERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:46.164
WE HAVE AND PROTECT VULNERABLE

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:46.765
CALIFORNIANS FROM LOSING THEIR

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:47.966
HOUSING.

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:49.100
THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY WE SHOULD

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.002
ONLY FOCUS ON PRODUCTION.

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:53.238
BUT I WOULD SAY EVEN IF TODAY WE

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.040
COULD ENTITLED ALL OF THE THREE

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:55.974
AND A HALF MILLION UNITS OF

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.475
HOUSING THAT WE ARE SHORT ON IN

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.376
CALIFORNIA.

00:27:58.443 --> 00:27:59.744
IT WILL TAKE YEARS IF NOT

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.279
DECADES TO BUILD.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.081
AND IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:06.418
PROTECTIONS NOW FOR CALIFORNIANS.

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.053
THIS BILL OUR BILL.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:08.987
IS A BILL TO ADDRESS RENT

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:10.688
GOUGING.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.057
OUR ANTI REGARDING BILL IS A

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:13.591
CRITICAL PROTECTION THAT WILL

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.593
HELP RENTERS WHILE STILL

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.228
ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO MAKE A

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.330
HEALTHY RETURN.

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.399
IT IS NOT RENT CONTROL.

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:22.867
IT IS MEANT TO PROTECT TENANTS

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:24.369
AGAINST THE MOST EGREGIOUS RENT

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.438
INCREASES NO MATTER WHERE THEY

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.072
RENTS ARE WHAT KIND OF UNIT THEY

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:28.740
LIVE IN.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:31.109
OUR BILL IS BASED ON A LAW THAT

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:33.111
HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:34.879
EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES FOR NEARLY A

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:35.880
HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS.

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:37.749
AN ANTI PRICE GOUGING LAW.

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.350
THAT PREVENTS INCREASES IN RENT

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.686
OR OTHER PRICES OR GOODS BY MORE

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:43.421
THAN 10%.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:46.057
AFTER AN EMERGENCY A DAD'S ASTOR

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:49.194
OR A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.562
GIVEN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:51.930
ARE STRUGGLING EVERYDAY IT'S

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:53.665
CLEAR THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING

00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.066
EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO ACT

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.469
ACCORDINGLY.

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:58.103
MORE TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHO

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:58.903
THIS BILL [inaudible]

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.438
WOULD HELP.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.606
OF CALIFORNIA SEVENTEEN MILLION

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.174
RENTERS.

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.476
WE HAVE TWO MILLION WHO ARE

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.478
PROTECTED BY RENT CONTROL.

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.147
BUT FIFTEEN MILLION WHO ARE NOT.

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:10.348
THIS IS A BILL THAT FOCUSED ON

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.083
THOSE FIFTEEN MILLION.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.251
WE ALL KNOW THAT RENTS HAVE BEEN

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:14.519
INCREASING MUCH FASTER THAN

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.387
INCOMES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS

00:29:16.454 --> 00:29:17.589
ALONE THE MEDIAN RENTS IN

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:18.690
CALIFORNIA.

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:21.092
HAS INCREASED BY OVER A THIRD

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.560
WHILE THE MEDIAN INCOME HAS

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:23.695
REMAINED FLAT.

00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.530
AND IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASED FOR

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:26.865
MANY CALIFORNIANS.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.234
AS A RESULT OVER HALF OF RENTERS

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.769
OVER 80% OF LOW INCOME RENTERS

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:32.804
ARE RENT BIRD.

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.906
WHICH MEANS A PAY OVER A THIRD

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:36.574
OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD RENTS.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:37.775
ACCORDING TO RECENT MCKINSEY

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.410
GLOBAL INSTITUTE STUDY.

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.912
EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:42.614
PAYING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.115
MORE FOR HOUSING THEN THEY ARE

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:45.984
ABLE TO AFFORD.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.051
THIS MEANS CHOICES THAT NO

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:49.020
FAMILY SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:50.388
WHETHER TO KEEP A ROOF OVER

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.990
THEIR HEADS OR KEEP THEIR

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.358
FAMILIES FED HEALTHY AND

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.193
EDUCATED.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.628
NOW LET ME SAY THIS.

00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:59.197
THIS BILL IS NOT A SILVER BULLET

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:01.232
FOR ALL OF THESE CONCERNS BUT WE

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.667
DO THINK THAT WILL GO A

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:03.434
SIGNIFICANT WAY TOWARD

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:04.936
PROTECTING.

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:06.771
THOSE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:09.541
THAT DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL.

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:10.008
EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY TWO

00:30:10.074 --> 00:30:11.509
ESTABLISHES A MAXIMUM RENT

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:12.977
INCREASE IN RENTS.

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:15.013
THAT IS SET OUT THE CONSUMER

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.849
PRICE INDEX PLUS 5%.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.350
GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:21.386
INCREASE IN CPI IS BEEN BETWEEN

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:23.121
TWO AND A HALF 23%.

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.756
IT FLUCTUATES WITH THE ECONOMY

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.624
SO IN HARD TIMES THIS CAP COULD

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:29.027
BE AT 5% IN A HOT ECONOMY LIKE

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:30.261
THE ONE WE HAVE TODAY

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.563
POTENTIALLY 10%.

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:33.298
AND IN KEEPING WITH THE PRICE

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:34.132
GOUGING LAW THAT I MENTION

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.168
BEFORE WE ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:39.837
INCREASE IN ANY YEAR OF 10%.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.906
WHAT THIS CAP DOES IS PREVENT

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:44.309
THE MOST EGREGIOUS INCREASES IN

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:45.143
RENTS?

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:50.448
A 15% 25% 50% A 100% 2100% THAT

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:51.082
WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT ALL TOO

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.816
COMMONLY.

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.718
IT PROVIDES A SENSE OF CERTAINTY

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.386
AND STABILITY SO FAMILIES WOULD

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:57.021
NOT NEED TO LIVE IN THE FEAR OF

00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:59.157
A GIANT UNKNOWN INCREASE OF RENT

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.892
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:01.459
THAT COULD FORCE THEM OUT OF

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.429
THEIR HOME. FOR LANDLORDS THIS

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:06.397
BILL WOULD STILL ENABLE THEM NOT

00:31:06.464 --> 00:31:08.433
JUST A FAIR RATE OF RETURN BUT A

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:08.933
HEALTHY RETURN ON THEIR

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.401
INVESTMENT.

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:11.469
WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED THIS

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.471
BILL WE INTRODUCED IT AT CPI

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.873
PLUS BLANK WE DID NOT PUT A

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.941
NUMBER IN?

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.276
I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:20.311
ALL STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT THE

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:21.579
APPROPRIATE NUMBER WAS.

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.982
LET ME SAY THAT CPI PLUS FIVE

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.683
CAME FROM THREE SOURCES.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.085
FIRST THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL AND

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:28.853
THE CONCEPT OF CPI PLUS FIVE

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.188
CAME FROM A PAPER.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.856
BY THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:33.358
FOR HOUSING INNOVATION CALLED

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:34.826
FINDING COMMON GROUND AND RENT

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.294
CONTROL.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:38.062
SECOND ALMOST IN ALL AFTER

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:39.664
ALMOST A TWO YEAR NEGOTIATION OF

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.499
THE BAY AREA BETWEEN TYPICALLY

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:42.967
WARREN STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:45.303
RENTS HOUSING INDUSTRY PLAYERS.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.771
TENANTS AND PROGRESSIVE EQUITY

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.073
ADVOCATES LABOR PRIVATE AND

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.708
NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.677
BAY AREA CASA COMPACT ALSO

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:55.079
PROPOSED CPI PLUS FIVE AS

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:57.015
SOMETHING THAT WAS AGREED UPON

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.116
BY THE PARTIES.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.784
THIRD I'VE ASKED BOTH SIDES OF

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:01.219
THIS DEBATE FOR DATA TO JUSTIFY

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.120
NUMBER.

00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:03.888
I WAS PROVIDED DATA FROM HOUSING

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.189
NOW.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.324
DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:08.693
STATISTICS THAT SHOWS THAT CPI

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.496
PLUS 5% IS ON AVERAGE.

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:13.965
A 100% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:15.967
MEDIAN RENTS INCREASE FOR EACH

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:18.636
OF THE STATE'S LARGEST REGIONS.

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:20.038
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AN

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:22.040
ANNUAL RENT INCREAE OF CPI PLUS

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.509
5% WOULD HAVE CUMULATIVELY

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:27.045
INCREASED RENT. FOUR TIMES

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.813
FASTER THAN THE ACTUAL.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.382
REGIONAL MEDIAN RENT INCREASE IN

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:32.750
CALIFORNIA.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.785
LET ME JUST CLOSE BY THANKING

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.586
EVERYONE FOR THIS CONVERSATION I

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.155
WANT TO THANK BOTH SIDES.

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:38.389
I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:39.357
CONVERSATION.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:40.892
BUT AT THE END THE DAY MY

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.227
PROFOUND HOPE IS THAT WE PROVIDE

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:44.395
THE CERTAINTY THE CALIFORNIA

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:45.463
RENTERS NEED.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.332
SO THAT THEY WON'T RECEIVE AN

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:49.067
EXORBITANT RENT INCREASE WELL WE

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.602
ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE A

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:52.170
FAIR RATE OF RETURN ON THEIR

IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.638
THE RENT AND THE HIGH COST OF OF

FROM OUR MEMBERS NOT ONLY -- IN

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.229
HAVE ONE DEVELOPER THAT IS NOW

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.731
TAKING HIM THIRTEEN YEARS. TO

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.000
GET TO THE TIME IN WHICH SHE

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.769
WILL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO START

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.604
CONSTRUCTION.

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.239
NO PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.474
OF HOUSING WE ARGUE IS TRULY THE

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:58.642
ANSWER.

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.344
DESPITE THE FACT IT TAKES WAY

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.613
TOO LONG BUT IT IS THE WAY TO

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.782
PROTECT TENANTS BOTH EXISTING

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:08.152
TENANTS AND FUTURE TENANTS.

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:09.787
NOW WITH THAT SAID.

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.422
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT OWNERS WHO

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:12.890
ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.693
BY THEIR TENANTS WOULD VIOLATE.

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:18.095
THE STANDARDS SET OUT.

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.997
IN THIS LEGISLATION.

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.032
HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS NOT AS

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:24.435
MUCH ABOUT.

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:25.736
THIS CURRENT.

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:28.072
BILL BUT THE FUTURE TEMPTATION

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.873
AND DEMANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.475
WILL FACE TO LOWER THE STANDARD.

00:43:31.542 --> 00:43:33.377
MOST RENT CONTROL CITIES STARTED

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.045
OUT WITH THE STANDARD SIMILAR TO

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:35.779
THIS.

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:39.383
BUT TODAY WE HAVE 60% OF CPI IN

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:43.253
SAN FRANCISCO 65% OF CP I AM

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.956
BERKELEY AND 75% OF CP I IN

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:47.224
SANTA MONICA.

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.360
AS HOUSING COSTS CONTINUE TO

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:51.261
RISE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A A HUGE

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.363
CONCERN.

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:53.464
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES FOR

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.432
EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES WENT UP

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.900
WITH RECYCLING OWNERS ARE FACING

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:59.670
A 3100% INCREASE IN IN RECYCLING

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.671
COSTS.

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.306
THEY CAN'T RECAPTURE THAT OF

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.173
COURSE.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.875
OWNERS DON'T OR OWNERS AND

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:07.077
TENANTS TO TENNIS DON'T MOVE

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.046
UNDER THOSE SITUATIONS.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.849
BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO LET

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.484
CITIES AND COUNTIES OFF THE HOOK.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.718
LACING BLAME OF COURSE ON THE

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:15.953
RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY IS AN

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.855
EASY ANSWER.

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:20.657
BUT PROVIDING PLACES FOR PEOPLE

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:25.062
TO LIVE IS THE REAL SOLUTION.

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:25.662
WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:26.597

PRICE INDEX. FOR CALIFORNIA TO

PROVIDE A LOWER CAP CERTAINLY IS

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.213
QUESTIONABLE OF COURSE OUR COST

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.248
OF LIVING HERE.

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.450
LAND PRICES CONSTRUCTION AND

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.886

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.321

WE ALL AGREE CALIFORNIA IS IN

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:36.026
THE MIDST OF A SEVERE HOUSING

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.761
CRISIS THE STATE WIDE FAILURE TO

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.129
KEEP UP WITH NEW DEMAND FOR

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:39.930
HOUSING.

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.265
EVEN THROUGH RAPID ECONOMIC

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:43.200
GROWTH AND NOW HISTORIC LOW

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.334
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES.

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:45.969
HAS RESULTED IN A SEVERE

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.671
SHORTAGE OF AVAIL HOUSING UNITS

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:49.206
AND CORRESPONDINGLY.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.741
RAPIDLY RISING HOUSING AND

RENTAL COSTS.

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.377
WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE A ROLE

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:54.845
IN DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.014
HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE MOST

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.149
IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT FACTOR

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.185
IS A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING.

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.819
THIS IS NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:03.921
THIS IS THE CONCLUSION FROM A

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.222
SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF ECONOMIC

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:07.191

DISINCENTIVE EYES IS DESPERATELY

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.175

RENT CAPS ON NEW CONSTRUCTION

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:31.648
SIMPLY DO NOT PENCIL OUT.

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:33.951
EVEN IN OREGON'S RECENTLY PASSED

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:36.053

RENT CAP WITH THE REALITIES OF

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:47.965
RISING COSTS ON LANDLORDS.

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:49.499
A PASS THROUGH PROVISION WHICH

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.001
WAS INCLUDED IN THE CASA COMPAQ

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.569

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.912
NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE HEALTH

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:02.479

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.480

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.982
ON TO THEIR TENANTS.

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.550
THE CASA COMPAQ ALSO RECOMMENDS

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.385
A SUNSET PROVISION TO PROVIDE

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.920

THIS NEW POLICY.

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:16.426
WE OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:17.527
NOT BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH THE

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:18.929

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:24.334

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:46.245
DURING THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.380
AND ONE OF THE THINGS ALL SAY IS --

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:50.516
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I THINK

02:09:50.582 --> 02:09:52.050
THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HAS

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.986

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:57.789

SO I HEARD FROM CA -- THE

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.160

CPI PLUS SEVEN THE OREGON MODEL --

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:06.431
THINKING ABOUT ASKING FOR A

ABOUT ALL OF THAT I'M NOT

AND I THINK WE WILL CERTAINLY BE

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.794
HAVING DISCUSSIONS -- IN THE

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:38.130
COMING DAYS AND WEEKS -- AS WE

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:41.967
AS WE HOPE TO MOVE THIS.

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:42.634
FOR I THINK JUST EXPLAINING THAT

02:10:42.701 --> 02:10:43.535
PARTICULARLY NOTING THIS THE

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:44.736
FIRST COMMITTEE -- HEARING FOR

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:46.305
THIS BILL -- IS IMPORTANT IS

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:48.006
SORT OF INDICATE WE AWARE ARE

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:49.641
AREAS OF GIVE IN I WANT TO

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:51.210
ACKNOWLEDGE -- CERTAINLY FOLKS

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:53.245
FROM -- THE BUILDING OWNERS ARE

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.613
PROPERTY MANAGERS FOR BEING AT

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:56.548
THE TABLE AND INDICATING THE

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:58.550
LEVEL OF OPENNESS THAT FRANKLY

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:01.486
IS NEW -- AND THAT SHOULD BE

02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:04.089
APPRECIATED A KNOWLEDGE -- AND

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:07.159
AND THIS MY GRATITUDE FOR THAT I

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:07.993
RECOGNIZE THAT OF A SHIFT IN

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.262
PERHAPS PREVIOUS -- EFFORTS --

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.363
INDEED YEAH I THINK EVERY

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.930
MEMBERS COMMITTEE -- WOULD

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:12.497
PROBABLY BE GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:14.166
WILL IS TO BE AT THE TABLE TO

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:15.500
HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS IDENTIFY

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:17.035
THINGS THAT NEED WORK AS OPPOSED

02:11:17.102 --> 02:11:18.003
REFLECTS OF NO.

02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:19.004
I THINK IT SIGNALS THAT WE ALL

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:20.572
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A CRISIS

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.674
IN THE STATE THE RENT IS TOO

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:23.475
HIGH AND WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:24.576
ABOUT IT.

02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:26.078
AND WHEN BOTH SIDES OF THIS

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:27.646
ISSUE -- ARE SAYING THAT THAT

02:11:27.713 --> 02:11:29.081
GIVES ME A SENSE AS A DECISION

02:11:29.147 --> 02:11:29.648
MAKER THAT THERE'S SOMETHING

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:32.150
THAT CAN BE DONE HERE -- SO I

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.285
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:34.419
CONTINUE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:35.687
CERTAINLY PERCENTAGES I THINK A

02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:37.556
REALLY IMPORTANT -- I THINK AN

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:39.358
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT THE THIS

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:40.592
SHOULD NEVER BE ABOUT --

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:42.394
STIFLING PRODUCTION -- WE

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:43.829
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY AN

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:46.565
ISSUE ABOUT A SUPPLY -- THAT WE

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:47.899
HAVE NOT BUILT ENOUGH HOMES IN

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:49.434
THE STATE FOR DECADES AND

02:11:49.501 --> 02:11:51.370
DECADES -- AND THAT WE THAT IS

02:11:51.436 --> 02:11:52.938
THE TRUE SOLUTION IN THE LONG

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:54.673
TERM BUT THEY ARE SHORT TERM

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.009
PAIN THAT SO MANY OF US FEEL --

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:58.644
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TAKE

02:11:58.710 --> 02:11:59.811
ACTION UPON AND I NOTE THE

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:00.846
COMMENTS OF THE BUILDING TRADES

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.347
SO I THINK THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:03.081
AWAY THEY'RE TALKING.

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:05.017
I THINK AS WORKING MIDDLE CLASS

02:12:05.083 --> 02:12:06.251
PEOPLE OF WILL BUILD A LOT OF

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:07.085
STUFF I KNOW THIS PROBABLY FEW

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:08.920
FOLKS BETTER SUITED TO EXPLAIN --

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:10.989
WHY WE NEED PROBABLY A NOT AN

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:17.396
EITHER OR BUT A A BOTH A AND

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:23.635
APPROACH -- ON I ASSEMBLY SO I

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:24.903
PREACH THE THE OF THIS OR NOT

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.238
STIFLING DEVELOPMENT I THINK THE

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:26.772
BILL CURRENTLY IS SILENT.

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.640
ON HOW THIS MIGHT APPLY TO NEW

02:12:28.707 --> 02:12:29.608
CONSTRUCTION IS THAT RIGHT IT IS.

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.275
AND SO THAT I THINK IS NECESSARY

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:31.476
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT FROM MY

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:31.977
EXPERIENCES AS A HOUSING

02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:32.844
COMMISSIONER THE PHARMACY

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:34.413
COUNCILMEMBER FORMER MAYOR OF

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:35.580
SAN DIEGO I GET.

02:12:35.647 --> 02:12:37.182
THAT -- I UNDERSTAND IT LANDED

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.250
ON THE TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:39.785
THAT AROUND -- I THINK THE THE

02:12:39.851 --> 02:12:41.219
PERFORMERS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:43.689
FINANCE NEW CONSTRUCTION -- DO

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:45.824
NOT RELY UPON RENTAL EIGHT YOU

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:49.695
OF YOUR ANNUAL RENT INCREASES OF

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:50.896
AT THE ARE UNDER THIS BILL YOU

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:51.563
CAN BE A MAXIMUM ABOUT 8% MORE

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:52.331
OR LESS.

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:53.165
I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.566
NEEDS THAT TO GET FINANCING AND

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:56.134
SO I THINK THAT YOUR CURRENT

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:57.202
POSITION IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT

02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:57.602
TODAY.

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:59.237
IF WE CAN SEE DATA THAT

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:00.439
SUGGESTED DIFFERENT APPROACH --

02:13:00.505 --> 02:13:02.174
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THIS

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.375
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD BE

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:05.811
INTERESTED IN -- IN TERMS OF THE

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:08.413
REST OF THE BILL -- I CAN CHECK

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.415
MY SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL WILL --

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:11.817
WILL UPON FURTHER.

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:14.052
HI I WOULD JUST I GUESS I'D WRAP

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:15.220
UP BY SAYING SO RECOGNIZE TIME

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:16.655
IS OF THE ESSENCE.

02:13:16.722 --> 02:13:17.889
IS THAT I WOULD WANT TO

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:19.324
APPRECIATE AND THANK THE TURNER

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:21.326
CENTER FOR I THINK REALLY

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:22.027
HELPING.

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:23.795
TO START THIS CONVERSATION -- IN

02:13:23.862 --> 02:13:25.464
THE AFTERMATH OF LAST YEAR'S

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:27.666
PROPOSITION -- TEN THAT COULD

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:28.633
NOT BE THE END OF THE

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:29.134
CONVERSATION AND REALLY

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:31.970
PROVIDING -- I THINK A A VERY

02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:34.272
REASONABLE APPROACH -- THERE WAS

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:36.274
A NEW STORY -- IN MY IN SAN

02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:38.009
DIEGO -- THIS PAST WEEK OF A

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:39.411
PROPERTY OWNER.

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:40.579
IN I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:13:40.645 --> 02:13:43.849
GONZALEZ IS DISTRICT -- WITH --

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:45.384
75% RENT INCREASE.

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:45.984
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.052
ANYONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.286
ISSUE TODAY THEY COULD STAND UP

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:50.789
OR DEFEND THAT KIND OF INCREASE.

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:51.890
AND WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:53.925
IS THAT WE KIND INCREASE WOULD

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:55.227
BE ILLEGAL -- IF IT WERE TO BE

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:57.396
LAW -- THAT KIND OF GOUGING HAS

02:13:57.462 --> 02:14:00.232
NO PLACE -- IN CALIFORNIA -- AND

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:00.866
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO STOP

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:01.967
THAT -- I THINK THE INDUSTRY

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:04.403
DOES A FINE JOB OF OF OF TRYING

02:14:04.469 --> 02:14:05.303
TO GET AMONG SOME SORT OF

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.705
RECOGNIZES OUR OUT LIARS -- BUT

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.306
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO BUDGET FOR

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:09.074
THAT AND I THINK ONE OF THE

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:12.310
WITNESSES SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY --

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:15.614
TO THAT -- IS SO -- I THINK THAT

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.282
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD TO SAID

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:22.921
SUPPORT HERE I GO I THINK THE I

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:23.555
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:24.956
LEGISLATION.

02:14:25.023 --> 02:14:25.590
IS A STATE WIDE NATURE OF IT --

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:26.558
I RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVEN IF

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:27.692
COSTA HAWKINS WERE REFORM TO

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:29.394
REPEALED NOT EVERY COMMUNITY

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.295
WOULD ADOPT IT -- INTO THAT

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:31.229
WOULD LEAVE US MAYBE PROBABLY A

02:14:31.296 --> 02:14:32.431
GOOD NUMBER CITIES I REPRESENT --

02:14:32.497 --> 02:14:33.932
UNPROTECTED FOR THEIR TENANTS --

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:35.133
THIS BILL TAKES A DIFFERENT MORE

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.668
UNIVERSAL APPROACH -- THAT I

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:38.870
THINK IS -- BENEFICIAL WHEN WE

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:40.539
KNOWLEDGE IS A STATE WIDE CRISIS

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:43.175
AND SO THAT'S AN INHERENT VALUE

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:45.777
IN THIS BILL -- SO THERE'S A LOT

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:46.611
TO SUPPORT HERE TODAY MISTER

02:14:46.678 --> 02:14:48.146
CHAIRMAN I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:50.282
MOTION -- TO ADVANCE THIS BILL

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:51.683
WITH YOUR ASSURANCES THAT THIS

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.718
IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS --

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:54.753
AND THAT STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:55.821
SIDES ARE WILLING TO KEEP THIS

02:14:55.887 --> 02:14:58.390
CONVERSATION GOING -- AS A

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:00.125
TENANT I UNDERSTAND THIS -- BUT

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:01.326
I'M A TENANT WHO HAS A PRETTY

02:15:01.393 --> 02:15:02.961
DECENT SALARY -- AND SO I

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:04.496
RECOGNIZE THAT I EVEN IF I MAY

02:15:04.563 --> 02:15:05.564
NOT BE A PROPERTY AND I STILL

02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:07.132
SIT HERE TO PRIVILEGED POSITION --

02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:08.099
BUT I DO WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF

02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:09.768
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO EVERY

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:10.769
TIME THEY GO TO THE DOOR THEIR

APARTMENT AND THEY SEE A NOTICE

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.371
FROM THEIR PROPERTY.

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:14.706
MANAGER ON THE DOOR -- THEIR

02:15:14.773 --> 02:15:16.842
HEART SINKS A LITTLE BIT -- THEY

02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:18.376
GET VERY VERY NERVOUS IN IF

02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:19.778
YOU'RE LIKE ME MOST THE TIME

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:20.378

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:21.112
BUILDING.

02:15:21.179 --> 02:15:22.747
BUT A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME IT'S

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:24.282
ABOUT A RENT INCREASE AND YOU

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:25.050

POSITION THAT GENERALLY I CAN --

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:30.822

02:15:30.889 --> 02:15:31.656
FOR MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS I

02:15:31.723 --> 02:15:32.390

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:38.630

02:15:38.697 --> 02:15:40.365
CONTINUE DIALOGUE I HOPE MY

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:56.314
WEEK IN THE BUILDING AS WE SAY

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:59.718
THE CAPITAL THERE IS BEEN MANY --

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:01.453

AND I THINK THIS PIECE OF

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:26.545
LEGISLATION IS THE SAME IN THE

02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:28.346
SENSE THAT WE COULD CLEARLY SEE

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:30.315

02:17:35.113 --> 02:17:36.748
IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.550
WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE SOME KIND

02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:41.586
OF STABILITY NOT ONLY FOR OUR

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:43.355
THE RENTERS BUT FOR THE ROAD THE

02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:45.323

THAT.

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:09.280
AND PERHAPS REALLY LOOKING AT

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:10.849
LOOKING AT THE BALLOT GOING

02:18:10.915 --> 02:18:13.051
TOWARDS A POINT WHERE WE KNOW WE

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:15.020
JUST LEFT THE BALLOT ON A AND

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:16.655
E'S MY DISTRICT IT WAS A VERY

02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:19.758
SPLIT -- OPINION -- ACTUALLY

02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:22.193
MORE OPPOSED TO ON RENT CONTROL

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:25.563
THEN -- SUPPORTING IT -- BUT

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.766
JUST THIS WEEK THINGS CHANGE

02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:32.637
CONSTANTLY -- WE HAD AND MY OWN --

02:18:32.704 --> 02:18:36.174
DISTRICT FULLER TEN AND ANAHEIM --

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:39.344
MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER KNEW WHO

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:42.781
CAME IN AND DID ALMOST A 3100%

02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:45.250
NOW THIS WAS OF COURSE CONTESTED

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:46.217
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THE

02:18:46.284 --> 02:18:47.552
CITY COUNCIL'S FULLER CAN ADD

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:48.720
ANAHEIM.

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.622
AND I KNOW THAT THIS OPERATOR IS

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:53.825
NOT ONE OF THE OPERATORS -- THAT

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.527
MANY OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:58.163
CALIFORNIA HAVE HE IS AND IN

02:18:58.229 --> 02:19:00.832

THIS BILL FORWARD.

02:19:05.503 --> 02:19:07.072
BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL ALL OF

02:19:07.138 --> 02:19:10.041
THOSE SO WITH THIS BILL MY HOPE

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:12.277
IS THAT THERE CAN BE SOME KIND

02:19:12.343 --> 02:19:15.146
OF ASSURANCE.

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:18.516
THAT AS IT MOVES FORWARD AGAIN.

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:20.151
WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE CENTER

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:21.653
AND WE MOVE TOWARDS THE CENTER

02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:23.154
WE OFTEN SEE.

02:19:23.221 --> 02:19:25.090
NEED EITHER SIDE ARE NOT

THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA END UP

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:31.196
HAVING TAKEN STEPS TOWARDS THE

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:33.398
MIDDLE SO WITH THAT I WOULD TO

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:09.260
LABOR STATISTICS SHOWS THAT CPI

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.763
PLUS 5% IS A 100% HIGHER.

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:13.298
THAN THE ACTUAL MEDIAN ANNUAL

02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:15.099
RENT INCREASE IN EACH OF THE

02:21:15.166 --> 02:21:16.734
STATE'S LARGEST REGION'S CPI

02:21:16.801 --> 02:21:18.570
PLUS FIVE OVER THE PAST TEN

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:19.704
YEARS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED RENT

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:22.273
INCREASES FOUR TIMES FASTER.

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.509
THAN SIMILAR RENT INCREASES IN

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:25.910
OUR STATE SO.

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:27.712
WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT BUT

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.080
IF THERE IS DATA THAT SHOWS A

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:30.548
JUSTIFICATION FOR A HIGHER

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:32.250
NUMBER OR FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION I

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:33.785
WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:36.087
WITH THE COPY OUT THAT IN THE IN

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.322
A MAJOR SHIFT IN A LITTLE BIT

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:38.690
BUT USING THE EXAMPLE.

02:21:38.756 --> 02:21:40.859
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.393
COSTA HAWKINS WAS DEBATED THE

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.295
IDEA WAS TO EXEMPT OUT NEW

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:45.730
CONSTRUCTION.

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:47.298
AND WHAT THAT STORY IN IN IN THE

02:21:47.365 --> 02:21:50.902
pTHEY DID IN MOST RENT CONTROL

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.437
CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO.

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:54.839
IS IT FROZE THE APPLICATION OF

02:21:54.906 --> 02:21:56.641
RENT CONTROL -- TOO BUILDINGS

02:21:56.708 --> 02:21:58.810
THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE A CERTAIN

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:01.679
DATE AND MIGHT CITIES EXAMPLE.

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:02.614
NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THAT IS

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:04.349
HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:06.317
IMPACTS AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS

02:22:06.384 --> 02:22:07.452
IS NOT RENT CONTROL THIS IS A

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.887
DIFFERENT CONTEXT.

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:09.787
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:11.155
IN HOW WE GO ABOUT IT BUT ALL

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:15.493
THAT BEING SAID IF THEY'RE FACTS

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:17.328
AND DATA THAT UNDERPIN THIS.

02:22:17.395 --> 02:22:18.162
WE VERY MUCH WANT TO GO TO

02:22:18.229 --> 02:22:19.163
RECEIVE THAT I'VE I'VE ASKED

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.231
INDUSTRY FOR THAT INFORMATION

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:21.599
AND AND HOPE THAT THAT WILL

02:22:21.666 --> 02:22:22.734
INFORM THE DISCUSSION THAT'S

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:24.269
WHAT I WANT. TO TO DRIVE THIS

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:25.870
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASY TO

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:26.771
ALLOW.

02:22:26.838 --> 02:22:28.473
IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES OR

02:22:28.539 --> 02:22:30.475
WHERE WE WANT TO SIDE ONE WITH

02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:32.477
THE OTHER TO DRIVE IT BUT WE ARE

02:22:32.543 --> 02:22:34.012
JOB AS DELIBERATE OF

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:35.980
POLICYMAKERS IS TO USE FACTS AND

02:22:36.047 --> 02:22:38.416
DATA. TO GET TO THE RIGHT ANSWER

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:39.350
TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE

02:22:39.417 --> 02:22:41.019
PROTECTS OUR RESIDENTS BUT ALSO

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:41.953
PROTECTS.

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:45.056
THE ABILITY OF OF THE HOUSING

02:22:45.123 --> 02:22:47.058
MARKET TO TO FUNCTION WELL.

02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:49.193
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:54.432

IMPORTANT ISSUE -- I KNOW IT'S

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:06.978
IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING IT'S

02:23:07.045 --> 02:23:08.413
LATE IT'S THURSDAY EVERYBODY

02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:09.714
WANTS TO GET BACK HOME AND TO

02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:11.616
THEIR DISTRICTS -- SO I WILL BE

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:13.418
BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS AND I WOULD

02:23:13.484 --> 02:23:15.553
ALIGN MYSELF A VERY CLOSELY WITH

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:17.655
THE COMMENTS OF MY FRIEND AND

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:19.123
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO.

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:21.459
I THOUGHT WAS SPOT ON A HIT IT

02:23:21.526 --> 02:23:22.427
OUT OF THE PARK ABOUT YOUR

02:23:22.493 --> 02:23:23.995
COMMENTS WERE GREAT AND AND I

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:25.630
WOULD BASICALLY SAY DITTO TO

02:23:25.697 --> 02:23:27.598
EVERYTHING THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:32.437
SAID -- BUT I I WANT -- TO MAKE

02:23:32.503 --> 02:23:33.237
SOME SLIGHT ADDITIONS AND JUST

02:23:33.304 --> 02:23:36.307
SAY I TO SUPPORT THIS NOTION OF

02:23:36.374 --> 02:23:37.742
STABILITY I THINK IT'S

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:39.344
SIGNIFICANT.

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:40.278
AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF REASONS

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:41.980
ONE IS OP FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

02:23:42.046 --> 02:23:43.481
JUST AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ON A

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:45.049
REAP REVISITING THIS EVERY

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:46.617
SINGLE YEAR -- BUT CERTAINLY I

02:23:46.684 --> 02:23:48.252
THINK PEOPLE ON ON ON EITHER

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:50.121
SIDE OF THIS ISSUE ARE ALL SIDES

02:23:50.188 --> 02:23:52.056
OF THIS ISSUE DON'T WANT SOME

02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:53.424
PING PONG UNITS BACK IN OUR UP

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:54.292
DOWN UP DOWN.

02:23:54.359 --> 02:23:55.827
YEAR IN YEAR OUT THERE'S A LACK

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:59.030
OF CERTAINTY AND THAT I THINK

02:23:59.097 --> 02:23:59.597
THAT LACK OF CERTAINTY HURTS

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:01.132
EVERYBODY -- I'M GLAD TO HEAR

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:02.700
YOU SAY YOU KNOW YOU YOU AND YOU

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:04.135
YOU HAVE SUFFERED YOU SAY IT A

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:06.471
NUMBER OF TIMES -- THAT YOU WANT

02:24:06.537 --> 02:24:07.638
THIS TO BE DATA DRIVEN YOU WANT

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:09.107
PEOPLE TO BRING IT OUT I THINK

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.575
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE IT BE.

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:11.876
HAVE SOMETHING LEGISLATION BE

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:15.513
DONE BY FAX -- I THINK IS IS --

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.582
IMPORT I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU --

02:24:17.648 --> 02:24:19.484
SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY REAL

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.985
ISSUE FOR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.453
AND PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS.

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.522
THERE OFTENTIMES ONLY A PAYCHECK

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:26.924
AWAY OR A NOTICE LITTLE BACK YOU

02:24:26.991 --> 02:24:27.959
KNOW PIECE OF PAPER ON THEIR

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:30.361
DOOR AWAY FROM FROM LOSING THEIR

02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:31.462
RENTAL PROPERTY FROM LOSING

02:24:31.529 --> 02:24:33.197
THEIR ABILITY TO HOUSE

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:34.198
THEMSELVES.

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:39.003
AND THEIR FAMILY AND I THINK TO

02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:41.939
YOU KNOW TAKE A IT'S SORT OF

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:42.507
BEEN BEATING LIKE A DRUM.

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:43.141
BUT IT DOES BEAR REPEATING THAT

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:43.741
THAT THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPLY

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:44.842
ISSUE BUT ALSO TO BE ADDED TO

02:24:44.909 --> 02:24:45.743
THAT TOO IS THERE'S A LACK OF

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:46.878
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE BECAUSE

02:24:46.944 --> 02:24:49.280
WHAT GOES WITH SUPPLY OF HOUSING.

02:24:49.347 --> 02:24:50.615
IS THERE HAS TO BE THE

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:52.183
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:54.252
SUPPORT THAT HOUSING THERE HAS

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:54.852
TO BE ROSE RECIPE WATER THERE

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:55.887
HAS TO BE.

02:24:55.953 --> 02:24:57.655
A QUALITY OF LIFE IF YOU'RE EVEN

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:58.956
IF WE WERE TO BUILD ALL THESE

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.825
UNITS WITHOUT THE FOR EXAMPLE

02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:02.727
THE ROADS TO SUPPORT THOSE UNITS

02:25:02.794 --> 02:25:04.529
FOR THE TRANSPORTATION. TO

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:06.364
SUPPORT THOSE UNITS THIRTY

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:07.665
SECOND TRAFFIC THE QUALITY OF

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:08.900
LIFE SO I THINK IT.

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:10.568
IT'S MORE WHEN WE NEED TO BE

02:25:10.635 --> 02:25:12.103
SICK TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN

02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:13.738
JUST SUPPLY IT'S CLEARLY A

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:16.674
SUPPLY -- BUT WITHOUT SUPPLY

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:17.675
COMES.

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.777
A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:22.013
THE STATE -- IN THE STATE NEEDS

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.114
TO BE PREPARED INVEST IN OR

02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:24.482
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE PEOPLE

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:28.486
THAT MAYBE HAVE A HOUSING UNIT

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:30.455
BUT THEY CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.

02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:31.055
IS A CAN'T THE THE THEY'RE NOT

02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:31.889
NEAR MASS TRANSIT THEY DON'T

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.091
HAVE MASS TRANSIT OPTIONS.

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:34.826
THEY'RE TRAPPED THERE ROADS ARE

02:25:34.892 --> 02:25:36.027
STUCK IN GRIDLOCK.

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:37.328
WATER IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:38.629
ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:39.831
THINK TO WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:41.432
AS A BODY BE THINKING OF THAT AS

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:42.333
WELL SO.

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:44.068
I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:25:44.135 --> 02:25:45.703
MEASURE AT TODAY LOOK FOR TO

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.972
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS IT.

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:51.709
HEADS TO THE FOUR THINGS AMONG.

02:25:51.776 --> 02:25:52.310
THANK YOU.

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:53.077
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A VERY

02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:55.046
HEFTY CONVERSATION -- AROUND

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:56.948
HOUSING ISSUES NOT JUST THIS

02:25:57.014 --> 02:25:59.050
WEEK BUT I MEAN OVER THE YEARS --

02:25:59.117 --> 02:26:00.751
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I GOT

02:26:00.818 --> 02:26:02.653
ELECTED I ASKED AND REQUESTED TO

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.056
BE ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:05.823
BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:07.625
IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO MY

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.160
DISTRICT BUT TO THE ENTIRE STATE.

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.395
AND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE

02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:13.531
HAVE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:17.001
ABOUT HUNDREDS OF BILLS RELATED

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:18.002
TO HOUSING.

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:20.471
AND APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

02:26:20.538 --> 02:26:21.472
FORTY SEVEN OF THOSE PASSED OUT

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:22.807
OF THIS HOUSE AT AT THE STATE

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:24.041
ASSEMBLY.

02:26:24.108 --> 02:26:26.944
WE MOVED THEM FORWARD SO.

02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:28.946
WHAT WE TAKE FROM THAT IS THAT

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:31.816
THERE IS NOT ONE SOLUTION TO

02:26:31.883 --> 02:26:33.251
SOLUTIONS OR THREE SOLUTIONS IT

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:35.553
TAKES YEARS OF DISCUSSION TO

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.155
ADDRESS THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.256
ECONOMY?

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:40.525
AND FIFTY EIGHT STATES AND FORTY

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:43.327
MILLION PEOPLE -- FIFTY SIX

02:26:43.394 --> 02:26:45.229
COUNTIES AND FORTY MILLION

02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:46.731
PEOPLE LIVING IN THE STATE THE

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:48.599
HOUSING CONVERSATION IS MUCH

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:50.902
MORE COMPLICATED THAN ONE SINGLE

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:51.602
BILL.

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:54.005
I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE PERSON

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.473
WHO HAS REACHED OUT TO OUR

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.241
OFFICES.

02:26:57.308 --> 02:26:59.810
WHO HAS TAKEN THE TIME? TO

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.812
EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN OVER

02:27:01.879 --> 02:27:05.183
AFFORDABILITY -- OVER.

02:27:05.249 --> 02:27:08.252
AT HOUSING OVERALL IN THE STATE.

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:10.221
IT IS ALSO CLEAR TO ME THAT AT

02:27:10.288 --> 02:27:13.057
EVERY COUNTY LOOKS AND ADDRESSES

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:14.525
THIS IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:16.928
BECAUSE OUR NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT --

02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:17.895
EIGHTY IN THE COUNTIES THAT I

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:19.897
REPRESENT I THINK A LOT ABOUT

02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:22.600
WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:23.901
SEVENTEEN AND WHAT RANK DOUCHING

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:28.306
MEANT. TO FIRE STRICKEN AND

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:30.641
DEBRIS FLOWS STRICKEN

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.743
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LOST. TOO

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:34.111
MANY HUMAN LIVES.

02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:36.247
ARE IN I KNOW THAT WHEN WE

02:27:36.314 --> 02:27:38.282

COUCHING IT HELPED KEEP PEOPLE --

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:47.225
IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE WE HAD

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:48.759
LOST SO MANY HOMES AND IT ALSO

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:50.494
GAVE THOSE THAT HAD LOST HOMES

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:51.996
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:54.298
SOMETHING -- THAT.

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:56.367
WAS GOING TO HELP THEM NOT JUST

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:58.236
IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT A IN THE

02:27:58.302 --> 02:27:59.770
FAR FUTURE AS WELL.

02:27:59.837 --> 02:28:01.005
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:28:01.072 --> 02:28:03.608
RECOGNIZE -- THAT OUR WORK IS

02:28:03.674 --> 02:28:05.142
NOT DONE WITH THIS BILL I

02:28:05.209 --> 02:28:07.211
APPRECIATE THAT THEIR HAT WHAT

02:28:07.278 --> 02:28:09.080
I'VE HEARD AND TAKEN AWAY FROM

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:11.449
THE CONVERSATIONS THE AUTHOR --

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:13.918
IS THAT THIS IS A WORK IN

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.386
PROGRESS AT THE CONVERSATION

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:16.654
CONTINUES THAT THERE IS AN

02:28:16.721 --> 02:28:18.556
UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS THAT

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.258
ARE COUNTIES ARE DIFFERENT --

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:21.592
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:23.594
ADDRESS THIS IN MANY DIFFERENT

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.364
FORMS AND BILLS -- BUT ALSO THAT

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:29.000
WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN NOT

02:28:29.066 --> 02:28:30.034
BRINGING.

02:28:30.101 --> 02:28:33.204
THIS PARTICULAR -- PERCENTAGE

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:35.306
CONVERSATION BACK ON A REGULAR

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.875
BASIS THAT WE COULD.

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:42.213
PERHAPS FIND A WAY TO COMMIT --

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:43.714
TO NOT REVISITING THIS ON A

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:46.317
REGULAR BASIS I WANT THE PEOPLE

02:28:46.384 --> 02:28:48.286
OF CALIFORNIA TO KNOW THAT THE

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:49.120
CASE THAT.

02:28:49.186 --> 02:28:52.590
THE STATE LEGISLATURE CARES AND

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:53.190
WE WOULDN'T CARE IF WE WEREN'T

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:53.724
REALLY.

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:55.860
LOOKING AT THE THE NUMBER OF

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:57.361
BILLS THAT WE HAVE AND IF WE

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:58.095
WOULDN'T HAVE PUT ANY THOUGHT

02:28:58.162 --> 02:29:00.531
INTO IT -- I KNOW THAT I HAVE

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:03.401
SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF MY

02:29:03.467 --> 02:29:05.236
COLLEAGUES ON THIS DíAS. TO

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:08.839
EXTENSIVE LINKS UP ABOUT WHAT

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:11.075
CALIFORNIA CAN DO -- NOT JUST

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.710
THIS WEEK BUT IN IN THE WEEKS

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:14.412
COMING AND WE DON'T WHETHER

02:29:14.478 --> 02:29:15.813
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.448
AISLE ARE NOT WE DON'T ALWAYS

02:29:17.515 --> 02:29:19.984
AGREE AND SOMETIMES WE AGREE.

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:21.952
BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR EXPERIENCE --

02:29:22.019 --> 02:29:23.154
AND THE VOICES OF OUR DISTRICT

02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:25.323
SHAPE HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:29.827
ISSUES -- SO I WILL BE

02:29:29.894 --> 02:29:30.528
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:31.329
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:29:31.395 --> 02:29:32.363
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA KNOW THAT

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:34.498
WE CARE THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:35.933
SERIOUSLY THAT THESE ARE HARD

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.436
CONVERSATIONS AND THAT OUR STATE.

02:29:38.502 --> 02:29:39.904
IS SUCH A BIG STATE AND

02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:42.340
COMPLICATED IN SO MANY WAYS --

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:44.241
BUT THAT WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:45.443
TO LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.011
THAT'S EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:48.546
OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:53.584
AND THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:55.519
THIS HOUSE HAS MOVED FORWARD.

02:29:55.586 --> 02:29:56.187
IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF

02:29:56.253 --> 02:29:57.555
COMMENTS -- RELATED TO THAT SO --

02:29:57.621 --> 02:29:58.489
YOU REFERENCED YEAR ON DISTRICTS

02:29:58.556 --> 02:29:59.090
AND THE CHALLENGES YOU'VE HAD

02:29:59.156 --> 02:29:59.724
WITH WILD FIRES AND MUD SLIDES

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:02.760
AND IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I

02:30:02.827 --> 02:30:04.528
MOVE FOR THE BILL THAT WAS

02:30:04.595 --> 02:30:06.997
SIGNED INTO LAW -- TO I WOULD

02:30:07.064 --> 02:30:08.466
DESCRIBE STRICTLY SLIGHTLY

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.800
STRENGTHENED THE PRICE GOUGING

02:30:09.867 --> 02:30:11.302
STATUTE THAT I REFERENCE THAT

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:13.537
CAN ONLY BE INVOKED IN THE EVENT

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:15.239
OF A NATURAL DISASTER OR SOME

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.607
SORT OF DECLARED EMERGENCY AND

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:17.541
AND THAT WAS.

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:18.843
WHEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT A

02:30:18.909 --> 02:30:20.444
MODEL LIKE THIS OF OF OF SOME

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:22.279
SORT OF ANTI?

02:30:22.346 --> 02:30:26.083
GOUGING STATUTE -- MR GLORIA

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:27.118
REFERENCE THE FACT THAT IT'S

02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:28.486
GOOD TO HAVE A STATEWIDE

02:30:28.552 --> 02:30:29.787
STANDARD ONE THING I WANT JUST

02:30:29.854 --> 02:30:32.056
POINT OUT ABOUT THIS BILL IS WE

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:33.557
AMENDED THE BILL WITH THE RECENT

02:30:33.624 --> 02:30:35.326
AMENDMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:37.361
CONCEPT OF A REGIONAL CPI WHICH

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:38.863
ARE NUMBERS THAT EXIST.

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:41.165
BUT TO ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:41.966
OF HOW.

02:30:42.032 --> 02:30:44.101
UP MORE REGIONAL ECONOMIES

02:30:44.168 --> 02:30:46.303
AROUND THE STATE ARE ARE DOING --

02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:47.405
TO RELATE TO THE CAP THAT'S

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:48.873
APPROPRIATE FOR THAT REGION AND

02:30:48.939 --> 02:30:49.874
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS.

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.575
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE I'LL JUST

02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:52.410
MENTION.

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.912
WE HAD CONTEMPLATED JUST SO YOU

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:55.479
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:56.113
SENSE OF THIS.

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.181
ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD GO WITH

02:30:57.248 --> 02:30:59.016
SAY SINGLE NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:01.485
A CPI PLUS NUMBER AND REALIZE

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:04.021
THAT CPI PLUS JUST PROVIDED MORE

02:31:04.088 --> 02:31:05.956
OF THE ECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY. TO

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:07.858
TO ADDRESSES WE COULD HAVE SAID

02:31:07.925 --> 02:31:09.693
AND A PERCENT CAP WHICH AT THIS

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:10.928
MOMENT IS EQUIVALENT OF SAY

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.696
STATEWIDE CPI PLUS FIVE BUT IT

02:31:12.763 --> 02:31:14.298
JUST MADE MORE SENSE FOR US TO

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:15.332
TAILOR IT THIS WAY SO.

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:16.233
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:19.069
IS SET A STATEWIDE POLICY BUT

02:31:19.136 --> 02:31:19.904
WITH ENOUGH.

02:31:19.970 --> 02:31:21.639
REGIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO TO TO

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:54.405
STEP FORWARD -- IN THIS HAS THE

02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:55.272
POTENTIAL TO REALLY MOVE THE

NEEDLE IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY AND

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:58.676

BECAUSE IT'S GOING.

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:05.349
TO AFFECT COMMUNITY STATEWIDE

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:07.017
MUCH BROADER THAN RENT CONTROL.

02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:08.118
WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL BECAUSE

02:32:08.185 --> 02:32:08.619
IT COULD HAVE UNINTENDED

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:10.488
CONSEQUENCES AND IF IT'S NOT

02:32:10.554 --> 02:32:11.522
DESIGNED CORRECTLY COULD MAKE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:12.957
THE PROBLEM WORSE A COULD

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:14.425
EXACERBATE OUR SUPPLY PROBLEM SO.

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:16.093

IS A REALLY REALLY.

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:24.568
POSITIVE ONE I THINK THAT WE

02:32:24.635 --> 02:32:25.769
SHOULD BE MAKING DATA ARE WE

02:32:25.836 --> 02:32:27.304
SHOULD BE MAKING POLICY BASED ON

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:29.106
EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH AND DATA.

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:29.940

DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.712
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECIFIC

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:36.146

DESERVE THAT I THINK THAT IT'S

02:32:46.924 --> 02:32:49.026
UNFAIR TO RENTERS TO HAVE THINGS

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:49.593
PING PONG AROUND I THINK IT

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:50.494
WOULD SEND.

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:51.629
TERRIBLE MARKET SIGNALS AND

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:53.397
COULD EXACERBATE OUR SUPPLY

02:32:53.464 --> 02:32:53.998
CHALLENGES THE FOR PING PONG

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:54.999
