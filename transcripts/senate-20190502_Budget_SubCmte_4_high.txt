IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M GOING SUPPORT FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO CONTINUE THE EXISTING HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES PROGRAM AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. ALSO KNOWN AS HIGH UP. I THE HIGHER PROGRAM IS BEEN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN PHILANTHROPY AND THE STATE SINCE IT'S A SEPT INCEPTION ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. THE INTENTION OF THIS COLLABORATION HAS BEEN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW COLLABORATIVE CROSS AGENCY PARTNERSHIP CAN ADVANCE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. BY TOUCHING ON ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH. ALSO KNOWN AS THE SOCIAL TO DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. BECAUSE OF ITS CROSSCUTTING NATURE EXECUTIVE ORDER S. O. FOR TEN ESTABLISH THE HEALTH NOT POLICIES TASK FORCE.

TO ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE AND HEALTHY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA. SINCE THAT TIME THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE HAS SERVED AS A FISCAL AGENT AND PROVIDED HIDEOUTS STAFF. TO THE STATE USING PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS. THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS ENABLED THE PROGRAM TO BE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ENGAGE IN SUPPORT THE STATE. HOWEVER THE LONG TERM GOAL OF BOTH PHILANTHROPY AND AS SHE SEE HAS BEEN TO SEE THIS COLLABORATIVE APPROACH INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE STATE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER SAID WE KNOW NOW THAT STAFFING FOR THE PROGRAM WILL NOT CONTINUE BEYOND TO SUMMER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS FUNDING WILL NO LONGER BE PROVIDED TO PH I HEARD PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. BY FOUNDATION PARTNERS. THE FOUNDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HIGHER PROGRAM. THAT HAVE BEEN CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THEIR INVESTMENT HAS BEEN INTENDED TO SUPPORT START UP AND NOT LONG TERM PROGRAMMANAGEMENT AND THE STATE PROGRAM. FOUNDATIONS HAVE INVESTED OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TODAY. IN RCENT COMMUNICATIONS THEY NOTED THAT HIGH UP HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIANS INCORPORATING HEALTH AND EQUITY IN IMPLEMENTING STATE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROGRESS THIS YEAR IN INSTITUTIONALIZING HI IT PROGRAM AS AN ONGOING FUNCTION WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT. WITH STATE RESOURCES. AT AS SHE SEE HAIFA SUPPORTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT INITIATIVES THAT ARE HELPING FOR FILL OUR STATUTORY DIRECTION IN MISSION TO SUPPORT CROSS AGENCY COLLABORATION.

QUESTION THIS YEAR CHIEF MUCH THUS FAR THE BENCH MARKS HE ACTUALLY CHIEF MUCH DO YOU HAVE A LIST OF FIVE TEN TWO THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN DONE AND ACCOMPLISHED IN THE BANK WORK. BILL FROM. WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ASK ABOUT -- WELL IT IT WAS REALLY A SPEAK TO SOME OF THE SPECIFICS A LOT OF THE WORK HAS BEEN REALIZED THROUGH ACTION PLANS -- THAT HAVE LOOKED ACROSS STATE PROGRAMS IDENTIFY WAYS TO IN BAD HEALTH AND REALLY. LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF THE PH I TEAM -- AND OTHER PARTNERS AND SO IT'S BEEN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO START INFUSING HEALTH THROUGH IT THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND SO DELAYED CAN PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLE YEAH I CAN PROVIDE A FEW EXAMPLES IN IN THAT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. ONE OF THE APPENDIX DOCUMENTS AT THE TABLE THAT LISTS SOME SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS. BUT A FEW OF THEM HAVE BEEN AND REALLY THAT THE PURPOSE OF HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES IS NOT TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS IT'S REALLY. TO ENHANCE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND HELP THOSE ACHIEVE MORE GOALS WITH THE SAME DOLLARS AND SO. OUT OUR TEAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE INPUT TO GRANT PROGRAMS ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS BRINGING HEALTH AND EQUITY OPPORTUNITIES AND LANDS TO OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS THAT HAVE GONE OUT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE PROVIDED HEALTH INPUT INTO THE STATE'S THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IS. GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES WHICH ARE THEN USED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR GENERAL PLANS AND SIMILARLY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT. HEALTH AND EQUITY CONSULTATION TO YOU THAT CTC AND CALTRANS AROUND THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION. PLANNING GUIDELINES SO IT'S BEEN A LOT OF BRINGING THESE HEALTH AND EQUITY PRINCIPLES IN TO WORK THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND STRENGTHENING. THOSE PARTNERSHIPS OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE ELEMENTS OF THE QUOTE ACTION PLAN CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT AND IS THE ACTION PLAN PUT FORTH IN THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT OPERATION MANUAL OR IS IT A REGULATION OR HOW DOES IT. WORK WITH THEM AS WELL AS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR PRIORITIES LIE AND WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES LIE IN TERMS OF IMPROVING. PROMOTION OF HEALTH AND EQUITY OUTCOMES. AND THEN WE DEVELOP ACTION PLANS WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH UP UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN VOLUNTARY. SO IT'S REALLY LOOKING FOR THESE AREAS OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS OR WHERE SOME DEPARTMENTS HAVE STRENGTHS THAT OTHERS DON'T AND WE PROVIDE A FORUM FOR SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES SHARING OF TOOLS. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ABOUT MEASUREMENT STRATEGIES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THE ACTION PLANS ARE -- WAY OF SUMMARIZING WHERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND BASICALLY OUTLINING AT STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN FORWARD AND THEN OUR STAFF ASSISTED APARTMENTS IN FULFILLING THE STEPS IN THOSE PLANS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEBODY FALLS DOWN ON SOME GIVEN ELEMENT. WHAT HAPPENS THAT SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING? THE PLANS ALSO I SHOULD ADD OR IN ARE BROUGHT TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL TO OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO ENDORSED THE PLAN -- AND THEN WE REVISIT THEM SO IF I THEY NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED WE CAN DO THAT OR MODIFIED IN ADJUSTED THEY USUALLY HAVE ABOUT A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. AND THEN WE WILL ADJUST AS NEEDED OR IF A NEW OPPORTUNITIES ARISE -- AND BRING THAT BACK TO THE COUNCIL AND WHAT IS IT JUST LOOK LIKE WOULD THAT BE LIKE NEW EQUIPMENT NEW TRAINING NEW PEOPLE KNEW WHAT. WELL FOR INSTANCE ONE EXAMPLE WAS AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT LOOKED AT HOW -- TO IN BED YOU KNOW AND THEN BRING ACTIVE AT ACTIONS AROUND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION TOGETHER. THAT IS BEING REVISITED ACTUALLY TO STRENGTHEN AND BROADEN THE SCOPE TO A BROADER HEALTHY TRANSPORTATION PLAN -- AND SO IT REALLY IS A PROCESS OF LEARNING AND GROWING THAT THE PLAN AS POTENTIALLY NEW FUNDING SOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE TO PARTNERS ARE AVAILABLE TO DO THE WORK. AND DO YOU HAVE THE VENT MARK BENCHMARKS OR MILESTONES IS THAT HAVE TO BE MET. AND SIX MONTHS THIS HAS TO HAPPEN IN EIGHT MONTHS THIS HAS TO HAPPEN IS THERE SOME KIND OF A SCHEDULE IF YOU WILL OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. YEAH THE ACTION PLANS TO INCLUDE TIME LINES AND DELIVERABLES WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS INTO HOW THESE ACTION PLANS ARE TRACKED AND HOW PROGRESS AS MEASURED.

OKAY -- IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. ALL RIGHT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. GOOD MORNING. I'M SORRY GOOD MORNING. RIVER WANTED ME TO GO YES. I WAS JUST TRYING -- TO THEY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- WELCOME AND TAKE IT AWAY. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERRY BARCELONA ENGINEER NOW AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO START BY THINKING EACH OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME THIS WEEK -- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE WAY CALIFORNIA DOES BUSINESS -- SO IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THANAN I. T. PROJECT AND AS I'VE TESTIFIED TO IN THE PAST THE BULK OF THE I. T. PROJECT ITSELF IS IS COMPLETED 98% OF THE ITEMS THAT WE HAD SET TO DEPLOY A HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN ARE IN PRODUCTION. AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY. IS -- REALLY PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY FTP AND OTHERS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY. WE ONLY HAVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS TOTAL REQUEST TO EXTEND THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FINAL AT TECHNOLOGIES THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND FOR THE CASH. FUNCTIONALITY COMING INTO THE STATE. THE REMAINING. DOLLARS IN THIS B. C. P. REALLY ARE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS TO IDENTIFY AND WORK WERE REALLY GONE FROM DEVELOPING A SYSTEM TO OUR DEVELOPING THE PEOPLE TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM. TO MAKING SURE THAT -- THE ERRORS THAT AFTER HE BE YOU KNOW. RAISED AS A CONCERN THAT WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY THEM IN OUR EXPEDITIOUSLY ABLE TO TO PUT THEM IN -- TO PRODUCTION AND TO TO STOP THEM FROM HAPPENING IN SOME CASES IT'S GUARD RAILS BECAUSE WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS UTILIZING THE SYSTEM. AND THERE ARE THERE ARE RULES AND SOMETIMES YOU YOU YOU DON'T FOLLOW THEM AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT WE WILL BE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS -- BUT WE WILL BE PROVIDING THESE RESOURCES. SOLELY FOR THAT FUNCTION THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IMPROVING OUR REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY I WITH THESE DOLLARS AS WELL AS DRESSING. THOSE VERY CRITICAL NEED TO THE DEPARTMENTS. THESE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE US WE BELIEVE TO GET ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS MONTHS AND CLOSED IN OUR SYSTEMS THERE'S THAT THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT TO THEIRS. THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THOSE DONE AND COMPLETED THROUGH THE OCTOBER. DEADLINE THAT THE CONTROLLER HAS NOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY PHYSICALLY ARE A 100% CLOSE ON THE ACCOUNTING SIDE. THAT LEAVES THE SYSTEM CONTROL AND IS AN ACCOUNTING EXERCISE AND SO WHILE. THESE DOLLARS WILL HELP ELIMINATE ALL OF THE SYSTEM ISSUES THE SYSTEM CONCERNS. THE ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE HAVING JUST UTILIZING THE SYSTEM. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. T. THAT I THE DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE A PERCENT CLOSE THEIR MONTHS. SO THAT'S WHAT THESE RESOURCES ARE FOR EONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S WE ARE LOOKING TO DO A LONGER. MORE IN DEPTH -- REVIEW OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM ITSELF TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED IN IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN TALKING ABOUT REALLY THE ACCOUNTING COMPLEXITIES THAT I FACE THE DEPARTMENTS. OF THIS ALLEY -- HAVE ANY COMMENTS PLEASE. A BRIAN METZGER LA -- WE AGREE WITH THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- WE DID WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN OUR LAST HEARING WE MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE A NEW PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE PROJECT THAT IT'S SINCE BEEN CHANGED -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING ON A NEW SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT TO UPDATE. THE PROJECT'S COST -- SCHEDULE IN SCOPE -- THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESSES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE -- AND SO WE WANTED KNOWLEDGE AT FIRST HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO OUTLINE THE SHORT TIME LINE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER AND TAKE ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL ONCE IT RECEIVES THAT NEW SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT -- THE FISCAL PROJECT TEAM EXPECTS TO SUBMIT A NEW S. P. R. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN MID MAY -- AFTER WHICH C. T. S. SAID IT WILL NEED AT LEAST TEN DAYS -- TO APPROVE THE S. P. R. AND THAT LEAVES THE LEGISLATURE LIKELY NOT HAVING A UPDATED PROJECT PLAN UNTIL MID TO LATE MAY. I'M WITHOUT THAT UPDATED PROJECT PLAN THE LEGISLATURE'S MISSING SOME INFORMATION THAT IT WOULD NEED TO EVALUATE THIS PROPOSAL -- SUCH AS FINANCIAL ANALYSIS WORKSHEETS THAT SHOW HOW THE ADMINISTRATION ARRIVED AT THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE REQUESTED AND THAT'S THIS BCP -- OUR OFFICE WILL DO ITS BEST TO REVIEW THE S. P. R. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO MAKE A DECISION -- IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER -- REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY AND CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED BY DEPARTMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO TRANSACT IN FRISCO -- THE REASON WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT IS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THERE ARE AT LEAST NINE DEPARTMENTS AS YOU'VE SEEN HERE TODAY WITH THAT TO BE THAT ARE REQUESTING THESE RESOURCES. I'M AND NOW DEPARTMENT OF FISCALES REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND WITHOUT THE INFORMATION FROM THE S. P. R. TO KNOW WHAT FUNDING OF POSITIONS -- COMPLEMENT OR DO NOT COMPLEMENT THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REQUESTED AS WELL AS KNOWING WHAT PREVIOUS POSITIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED IT'S HARD TO CROSSWALK THAT. TOO AND SO WITH THAT ALL ALL TAKE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE A QUESTIONS [inaudible] NUMBER FINANCE. VETERAN PARMA FINANCE BE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL IS BUDGETED. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE VITAL FOR TO ENSURING THAT THE DEPARTMENTAL STAFF -- FOR CONTINUE TO RECEIVE EDUCATION ON HOW TO CLOSE -- MONTH AND YEAR AND PROPERTIES. WHAT WAS THE KEY? MAYBE YEAH WHAT IS THE KEY IS IT TRAINING OF PEOPLE OR IS IT DEVELOPING MANUALS OR YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT WE'RE TRYING? TO COME UP WITH HERE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP TRACK OF IT. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO WORK. DID YOU HAVE PLANNED. SO WE DO WE DO HAVE A PLAN SENATOR AND WHAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO DATE HAS BEEN A TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL WHERE FOLKS HAVE COME INTO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISCALE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF ONLINE TRAINING. AND WE'VE RECENTLY IN THE PAST YEAR BROUGHT NEWS CREATED THESE THINGS BECAUSE OF SUPPORT LABS WERE DEPARTMENTS COME IN WITH THEIR WORK. AND SIT IN OUR OFFICES AND WE HELP THEM GET THROUGH IT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WELL WE'VE STANDARDIZED THE SYSTEM TO THE EXTENT WE CAN. WE STILL REMAIN. THE FACT STILL REMAINS THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS. THESE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO GO AND HELP. THEM. LEARN THEIR PROCESSES AND READ RIGHT THERE PROCESSES TO FIT WITHIN THE SYSTEM WE CAN. YOU KNOW PUT THE GUARD RAILS HAPPEN WE CAN TELL THEM THIS IS YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. BUT THERE IS THIS DISCONNECT pBETWEEN. OKAY THEY'RE THE ONLY DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE THAT DIES. THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM. IT'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES WITH THIS IS HOW NOW WITHIN THE FISCAL SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S A LOT THAT'S WHY AGAIN THESE RESOURCES ARE NOT. FOR MORE SYSTEM WORK IN MORE IN YOU KNOW DEVELOPING MILESTONES IT REALLY IS DEVELOPING THE PEOPLE HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY ARE DEPARTMENTS STRUGGLING IN CERTAIN AREAS. WHERE OTHERS? ARE CLOSING THEIR MONTHS REALLY EASILY SO WHAT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION AND HOW CAN WE AS AN ADMINISTRATION. COLLECTIVELY COM -- TO A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO HOW CAN WE IF IT'S MANUALS FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT MIGHT HELP THEM PRODUCE THE MANUALS FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS. IF IT'S MORE TRAINING OR SPECIFIC HANDS ON KEYS WE'RE LOOKING TO MOVE OUR ENVIRONMENT UP INTO -- THE THE CLOUD. SO THAT WE CAN SPIN UP TESTING ENVIRONMENTS MUCH MORE QUICKLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO WAIT. I'M IN TAKE TURNS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN CAPACITY ON OUR PROMISES SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITH. THIS WITH THESE RESOURCES SO MOVE MORE OF OUR SYSTEM INTO THE CLOUD TO ALLOW FOR THE TRAINING AND TESTING THE DEPARTMENT SO DESPERATELY ARE ASKING US -- FOR AS WELL AS THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS. JUST TO CLARIFY WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL -- F. T. EASE ON THE STATE SIDE THESE ARE ALL CONTRACT DOLLARS WE'RE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE AGAIN WE LOOK. TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING PROVIDE THE RESOURCES BE THEM HARD COPIES OR THROUGH BETTER ROBUST TRAINING BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR RESOURCES AT FISCAL ON GOING OKAY. QUESTIONS HELLO WE THANK YOU ALL FOR ENGAGING IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD -- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BUT WELL I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION. OF BUT THIS. THIS BILL DOES DOES BEG FOR A DEEPER DIVE THANK YOU YEAH -- I GUESS AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD TO SAY OF YOU WANT TO DO. YOU KNOW FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO SEE WHAT IS THERE. WHAT IS THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM FACING THEM INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS? THE BY NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. FOR MANY DEPARTMENT SO I'M NOT SURE 80% OF THE TICKETS THAT COME INTO MY SYSTEM TODAY. OUR HOW TO QUESTIONS SO HOW DO I DO X. Y. Z. OKAY SO THEY ARE NOT THE SYSTEM IS KICKING OUT THIS ERROR I DO GET SOME OF THE WHAT DOES THIS. MEAN AND SOMETIMES THAT ERROR IS. YEAH YOU YOU ENTERED SOMETHING IN THE WRONG COLUMN YOU KNOW SO SOMETIMES IT'S HUMAN ERROR AND SOMETIMES I DO HAVE AN AREA THAT WE HAVE TO GO IN AND FIX. IT SO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THE BOULDER THE TICKETS ATMIAMI DEPARTMENT RECEIVES FROM. THE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO CLIENTS ARE REALLY ON HOW TO DO THEIR JOBS. AND SO WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE AGAIN THEY HAVE THE THE ACCOUNTANTS FOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH -- SOME OF THAT THE STAFF AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. WE ARE DEALING WITH THOSE HOW TO ACCOUNTING AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP US IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO DO WHATEVER TRAINING ON NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON HOW TO UTILIZE THIS SYSTEM. REMEMBER WE'RE GOING FROM A TRANSACTIONAL BASED SYSTEM. TO AN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM S THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS THAT MANY OF THE ACCOUNTANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD TO BALANCE LEDGERS AND TO DO THE ACCOUNTING -- ALL UP FRONT. AND FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW EACH OF THESE LETTERS WORK SO. WE JUST NEED TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL. THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT SO THAT AGAIN. THE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED. AND WOULD YOU SAY. IN YOUR OPINION [inaudible] THAT. YOUR SEEN ENOUGH OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS. BY THE STATE. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT WERE. DOING THE RIGHT THINGS OR ARE WE STILL. SORRY TESTING TO SEE WHAT NOW I I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BUDGET HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE. AND YOU RECEIVED A CREDIBLE BENEFITS ONLY A BUDGET THAT IS BEFORE YOU WAS CREATED. THROUGH THE USE OF THAT THE HYPERION THAT THE FISCAL SYSTEMS OKAY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE A BUDGET FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN FOR THE PUBLIC. AS ENACTED WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU GET IN JANUARY SO OF COURSE JANUARY IS THAT FIRST SALVO FROM THE GOVERNOR SAYING THIS IS WHAT I THINK THE BUDGET SHOULD BE. BUT THEN AFTER ALL OF THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIES THERE IS OT -- THERE HAD NOT BEEN A SINGLE DOCUMENT THEY COULD SHOW YOU THIS IS THE GOVERNING DOCUMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU HAD TO GO TO CHANGE BOOK YOU HAD TO GO TO THESE OTHER SYSTEMS. FISCAL NOW PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND IT IS AVAILABLE TO BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC I THE WE SO WE HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE BUDGETING SYSTEM WE HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO NOT ONLY CAN YOU -- DEPARTMENT SOLICIT BIDS -- FRAUD GOODS AND SERVICES FROM VENDORS THROUGH THE SYSTEM. NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND VENDORS HAVE UTILIZED THE SYSTEM TO REGISTER. AND ALL OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND DISABLE BUSINESS VETERAN ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CERTIFY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THIS SYSTEM -- INSTEAD OF A PAPER PROCESS SO THE KELLY PROCURE WHICH WHAT WITH WHAT THEY CALL. THE CALIPERS GENERAL SERVICES IS COMPLETE. THE MODIFIED A CRUEL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ACCOUNTING PIECE OF THE DEPARTMENT -- ACCOUNTING IS BUILT AND IS BEING UTILIZED BY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND USERS. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE STRUGGLES AND SOME OF THE EDUCATION IN THE LEARNING CURVE. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE YOU KNOW IT'S WITH A LARGE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SHIFT. ON SOME OF THE BUGS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT ALL IN ALL WE HAVE PRODUCED YET THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA IS A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED HYPERION. SUCCESSFULLY. PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES UTILIZES FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CALLED PRIME. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THE PROCUREMENT SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT. HUGE IT PROJECTS THEY ARE HUGE PROJECTS THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED IN ARE BEING UTILIZED TODAY. SO WHAT REALLY REMAINS IS THE CASH BOOK OF RECORDS. AND NOT KEYS ARE IS WHAT WE ARE EXTENDING OUT SO AGAIN OF THE PROPOSAL THAT IS BEFORE YOU THERE'S SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ARE ASKING. FOR TO EXTEND BASICALLY TO EXTEND CONTRACT RESOURCES. TO ALLOW FOR THE ADDITIONAL TESTING BUT TE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE -- WANTS TO HAVE IN THE SYSTEM BUT THEN ALSO TO ALLOW FOR DEPARTMENTS TO COME IN AND DO SOME ADDITIONAL TESTING ON THE NEW FUNCTIONALITY BEFORE IT IS RELEASED. SO. LIKE I SAID THE BULK OF THESE DOLLARS ARE REALLY. FOR THAT EDUCATION AND HOW DO WE REALLY MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM THE OTHER THING THAT IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS. FOR THE FISCAL SYSTEM THAT -- IS I BELIEVE CHANGING A LOT OF THE DIALOGUE ON HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. FINANCE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS OUR TRANSPARENCY WEBSITE. SO IF YOU'RE OPEN FISCALE WORK TO MY WEBSITE FISCALE LOTS YET YIELDING YOU CLICK ON IT YOU CAN SEE EXPENDITURE DATA. FOR IT'S NOT A 100% OF THE DEPARTMENT'S YET BECAUSE THE SIXTY FOUR AREN'T OP THAT JUST CAME ON IN JULY. BUT I BELIEVE I'VE GOT EIGHTY EIGHT THE BULK OF EIGHTY EIGHT DEPARTMENTS -- UP. ON THERE ALREADY WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING ON THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS THE TARGET IS THE SUMMER THIS SUMMER. AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AN ANYBODY AGAIN CAN UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION THEY CAN DOWNLOAD THE DATA THAT THEY CAN SLICE IT AND DICE IT THE WAY THAT THEY SEE FIT. BUT THIS IS HUGE HUGE IMPROVEMENTS. IN BOTH TRANSPARENCY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE ABILITY TO BETTER MANAGE FOR OUR AGENCIES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SO MY SENSE AS NOT KNOWING. TECHNOLOGY THE WAY THAT YOU DO BUT MY SENSE IS THAT. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT MORE SOPHISTICATED. PROGRAM. BUT THE DOWNSIDE HAS BEEN. THAT -- THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WERE NOT PREPARED VARYING DEGREES OF OF SUCCESS IN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS MATT WOULD SAY THAT. AT THIS POINT MOVING FORWARD -- YOU KNOW DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. TO OPERATE FISCAL. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE ESTIMATING FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THIS THIRTY SAYS THAT THIS THIRTY ONE PLUS YEAH -- RIGHT AND IT'S IT'S A THREE YEAR PROPOSAL SO IT'S THIRTY SEVEN IN THE FIRST YEAR TWENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN IN THE SECOND AND NINETY POINT FOUR IN THAT THIRTY YEAR. AND AGAIN THAT IS. WHAT WE ARE ASKED? TAKE FOR BOTH THE ART DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE A BETTER FLOW IN UNDERSTANDING OF OF THE SYSTEM FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BETTER TRAINING. PRESS TO GET BETTER TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR OUR OWN STAFF IN PLACE BECAUSE REMEMBER THIS IS A NEW SYSTEM STATEWIDE MY STAFF ONLY HAVE FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE UTILIZING IT SO WE'VE BEEN GROWING AND LEARNING. WITH THE SYSTEMS DEPLOYMENT OUR CONTRACTORS HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE UTILIZING PEOPLE SOFT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- AS WE BRING ON NEW EMPLOYEES INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS OUR GRADUATING IN COMING TO THE STATE FROM. I'M VERY STATE SCHOOLS SACKS STATES A GREAT EXAMPLE THEY TRAIN ALL OF THEIR ACCOUNTS USING PEOPLE SAW. THESE FOLKS THAT ARE COMING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME ARE WALKING IN THE DOOR AND HELPING THESE DEPARTMENTS. WITHOUT ANY WITHOUT ANY ISSUES SO SO THERE IS THIS CHANGE MANAGEMENT PART. BUT WHEN YOU'RE COMING IN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM WE NOW ARE WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM. DOES IN FACT. DO YOU SIR CAN PRODUCE -- FASTER RESULTS AND MORE. YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS OF THE MORE DETAIL WITH WITHOUT THE STRUGGLES AT SOME OF SOME OF OUR CURRENT STATE STAFF HOUSE. AND THIS IS A HUGE MORE THAN AN I. T. IMPLEMENTATION THIS HIS. LIGHT I I CAN'T STE STRONGLY SAVE ENOUGH THAT WE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DO THEIR JOBS. EVERY SINGLE DAY WHAT THEY DO COMING AND WE'RE CHANGING HOW THEY GO ABOUT DOING IT. SO -- YES SO I I'M NOT LOOKING. TO YOU KNOW ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR AT FOR WHAT FOR WHAT THE PROJECT IS TODAY. I WILL NOTE FOR THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT WE DO HAVE NINE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE DEFERRED CURRENTLY FROM BEING INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM. WHEN THOSE DEPARTMENTS DO COME ON WHEN THERE'S THE USEFUL LIFE OF THEIR SYSTEMS COME TO AN END AND THEY LOOK TO TRANSITION? TO TO THE FISCAL SYSTEM I DON'T HAVE A CHRIS. VENTURE A GUESS THAT I WOULD NEED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE ON BOARDING THE CONFIGURATION AND THAT THE TRANSITION OF THESE BECAUSE THESE ARE BIG DEPARTMENTS. CALTRANS CDC OUR WATER RESOURCES THE ON THE YOUR SOME OF THAT. SOME OF THE LARGER -- DEPARTMENTS SO WE CAN EXPECT A REQUEST FOR RESOURCES TO COVER THOSE NINE ADDITIONAL READY PART FOR THE ON BOARDING PASS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO ME IS. THERE'S RESOURCES TO FISCALE BUT THEN THERE'S INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS THAT ALSO COME TO US REQUESTING MONEY TO STAFF UP RIGHT -- SO DO YOU EXPECT. THAT WE WOULD ALSO HEAR FROM. EITHER OF DEPARTMENTS ARE ALREADY ON BOARD OR THE NINE ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY WILL ALSO COME INDIVIDUALLY. TO ASK FOR RESOURCES. TO CARRY OUT THE FISCAL. I HAVE IMPLEMENT YEAH I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THAT. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR ARCH SUPPORT THAT THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM. AND WHAT I HEARD FROM. HAVE LIKE IF TO BE. IN READING SOME OF THE OTHER BE CITIES IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING -- FOR RESOURCES THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO DEAL WITH THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT IS -- IN SOME CASES REQUIRED. IN THAT IN THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE KEY ONES IS SMALL TO SMALL MEDIUM DEPARTMENTS -- WILL HAVE VERY SMALL ACCOUNTING SHOPS AND AS A RESULT. FISKE OUT NOW IT'S NOT A NEW REQUIREMENT BUT FIST CALLIN FORCES YOUR SEPARATION OF DUTIES SO I CANNOT GO IN AND PUT IN A REQUISITION AND BUY SOMETHING. AND THEN ALSO BE THE APPROVER. THERE NEEDSTO BE A SEPARATE BODIES TO BE ABLE TO DO PROPER ACCOUNTING. I SAW SOME OF THEM. ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE ASKING FOR RESOURCES FOR THAT TYPE OF THING BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I CAN'T SPEAK TO IT. THE CONDITION OF THE ACCOUNTING OFFICE IS A AND THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. A SO WE EVALUATE REQUESTS FROM APARTMENTS RELATED DEFENSE GODS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND IF THEY HAVE A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT DOES REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES WE RECOMMEND THOSE FOR APPROVAL -- BUT WE WE CAN'T REALLY PROJECT OUT THAT WE KNOW TODAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE ANY DEPARTMENTS ARE WE GONNA BE COMING FORWARD IN FUTURE YEARS. MORE RESOURCES RELATED TO FRISCO -- AND RELATED TO THE REPORTING THAT ELLIE I MENTIONED EARLIER -- THERE IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINTEEN BUDGET ACT. THAT DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO REPORT ON OTHER COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED RELATED TO FIX GAL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOUTS BUT SO THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE COLLECTED AFTER THE AFTER THE PROJECT IT IS IS OVER AND WE CAN. ACTUALLY GET A FULL. THE HOTEL. WHEN IS THAT -- IT'S GONNA BE THAT THE THE PROPOSAL WAS FOR THAT THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN. NINETEEN TWENTY SO IN. TWENTY IS WHEN WE CAN HEAR THAT BUT THAT WILL BE AFTER IT'S ALL. YES BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO THE BILL THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT WE WE PROVIDE ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND I CAN PROVIDE ALL OF WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION UNTIL THE PROJECT IS. COMPLETE [inaudible] YES. JUST TO CLARIFY THAT -- THE THE SUPPLEMENT REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT -- FINANCES REFERRING TO DOES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION I BELIEVE COSTS FOR DEPARTMENTS TO TRANSACT IN FISCAL. WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FINANCES APPROACH TO TO DOING THIS IS TO LET THE PROJECT INTER KIND OF THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS PHASE AND THEN START AGGREGATING THOSE NUMBERS. IS IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE ART LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SAYS SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT IN SUPPLEMENT REPORTING LANGUAGE COULD DO SO. ACTION ITEM TO WRESTLE WITH THE HOST OF WE DO GET SOMETHING CLEAR -- UNIT. TOO MUCH IS TOO VAGUE. FOR ME TO GET MY HANDS ON IT RIGHT NOW [inaudible] YEAH. YEAH I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE THE ON GOING IF IT WAS ALL COMING THROUGH FISCAL SAYING. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED THIS IS HOW EVERY DAY. BUT EVERY DEPARTMENT NEEDS WITH THE RESOURCES ARE THEY GOING TO BE NEEDED. WHETHER IT'S TRAINING THE DEPARTMENT STAFF FOR YOUR OVERSIGHT OR YOU KNOW. RESOURCES FOR YOUR ROLE. IT JUST SEEMS TO BE COMING IN. ADDISON DIFFERENT. FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES RATHER THAN. HERE'S HERE'S THE TOTAL PICTURE. AND THIS IS HOW WE AIM TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT AND I THINK THAT'S AS PART OF MY SORT OF FRUSTRATION. AND WANTING TO BE HELPFUL. BUT JUST YOU KNOW ONE WEEK IT'S THIS AND OTHER WEEK IT'S THAT DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT AND THEN ALL COMING. FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU TO SAY YES THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED AND AFTER ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE -- COME ON BOARD SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULD HAVE A BETTER IDEA AT LEAST OF THE REMAINING. AFTER ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. SO DISTANT ISSUE [inaudible] TO ANYMORE. OKAY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK -- STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD ITS OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. HEARING NONE. OKAY CLICHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY EFFICIENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY
