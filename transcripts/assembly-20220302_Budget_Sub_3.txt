SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE AND THE SECRETARY CROWFOOT I ASSUME YOU'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLUE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME OUR DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT WATER IN DROUGHT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN RECENT YEARS ALLOCATING IMPORTANT FUNDING TO BUILD OUR DROUGHT RESILIENCE. WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE DRIVEN EXTREMES CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVEN EXTREMES ARE TESTING CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEM. AT TWO YEARS FOLLOWING JULY TWENTY TWENTY RANK AMONG THE HOTTEST AND DRIEST IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. WE ARE EXPERIENCING A REMARKABLE WINTER WINTER WEATHER HAS SEE SAWED BETWEEN POWERFULLY WET STORMS IN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER AND THEN EXTREMELY DRY WEATHER THE REST OF THE MONTH. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES JUST CONDUCTED THEIR MOST RECENT SNOW SURVEY IN THE SIERRA NEVADA AND SHARED WITH US THAT IT IS JANUARY AND FEBRUARY IS THE DRIEST IN OVER A CENTURY OF RECORD KEEPING. THE EXTENDED RUN OF DRY DAYS HAS OBVIOUSLY STRONGER SIERRA SNOW PACK THAT WE RELY ON FOR WATER SUPPLY FROM WELL ABOVE AVERAGE TO BELOW AVERAGE. AND NOW MOST MAJOR RESERVOIRS FALL BELOW AVERAGE STORAGE SO IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARING FOR A THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR UP DROP. WE ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO DROUGHT EMERGENCIES FROM SMALL ISOLATED COMMUNITIES WITH WATER SUPPLY ISSUES TO SPECIFIC SPECIES IMPACTED BY THESE CONDITIONS. AT THE SAME TIME WHILE WE RESPOND TO THOSE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WE'RE KEEPING OUR EYES FOCUSED ON HELPING REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE THE OLD LONG TERM RESILIENCY. TO DROUGHT AND ADJUST TO THIS NEW NORMAL WITH MORE FREQUENT AND HARMFUL DROPS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE NEAR TERM ACTIONS AND THE LONGER TERM ACTIONS. WHAT YOU KNOW LAST SUMMER AND FALL WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP WE ARE ALLOCATED APPROVEDFIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO RESPOND. TO DROUGHT AND FLOOD TO BUILD WATER RESILIENCE REMARKABLE HISTORIC AMOUNT OF MONEY. HE'S INVESTMENTS THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRACK THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE CALL OUR WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO IT'S OUR ROAD MAP IN THE NEW CIVIC MINISTRATION TO ADDRESS DROUGHT AND FLOOD. AND BUILD RESILIENCE WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S WATER CHALLENGES IT'S REALLY A CASE YOU TO THE REALLY A CASE OF ALMOST SILVER BUCKSHOT. ALL SORTS OF INVESTMENTS I AM CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TO MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM WITH A FOCUS ON BUILDING REGIONAL WATER RESILIENCE WE CANNOT PURSUE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A BIG AND DIVERSE STATE. DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE EXPERIENCED THESE CHALLENGES DIFFERENTLY SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS THAT BUILD THAT'S WATER RESILIENCE I REGIONALLY. B. AS IN. THAT ARE BEING MADE THIS YEAR INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT'S ALREADY GOTTEN OF THE DOOR IN BEING PLANNED FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WILL PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION. BOTH IN DESTRUCTION SUBSEQUENT DROUGHTS. I TALK ABOUT FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLARS AGREED UPON BY THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS THAT INCLUDES PROPOSED FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR WATER RECYCLING AND GROUNDWATER. NOPE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE REGIONAL WATER CONVEYANCE. A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR FOUR DOORS IN JANUARY PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD OUR WATER RESILIENCE AND RESPOND TO DROUGHT. AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND FRAME THAT HOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO SPEND OUT SOME OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF PROPOSED FUNDING. YOU KNOW AND MANY OF YOU HELP LEAD OUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION CALLED MAKING CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE. FOCUSED ON ON NOT ONLY TAKING TEMPORARY ACTIONS TO REDUCE WATER USAGE BY BUILDING OR LONG TERM WATER EFFICIENCY AND WHILE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS WE RECOGNIZE STATE INVESTMENT CAN SUPPORT NOT PROGRESS BUILDING OUR WATER EFFICIENCY. SO THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSED FUNDING INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO SUPPORT LOCAL WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN BOTH LARGE CITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION. AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE AIM OF HELPING LOCAL AGENCIES REPLACE ORNAMENTAL TURF. KIND OF A LONG THAT NO WALKS ON EXCEPT TOMORROW IN AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUE SECRETARY ROSS HERE TO. HIGHLIGHT THAT SIMPLY PUT WE KNOW THAT RESILIENT PLANTS THE CLIMATE APPROPRIATE TREES USE LESS WATER. EACH SQUARE FOOT OF TURF REPLACED SAVE THIRTY SIX GALLONS OF WATER PER YEAR ON AVERAGE WE KNOW WE CAN CITY WATER WHILE I. A BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITIES BUILDING GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SHADES AND COOLS US. AT SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE INVESTMENTS HELPING GROUND RECHARGE WE KNOW PART OF THE SOLUTION TOWARD BUILDING RESILIENCE IS GETTING WATER IN THE WINTER WHEN IT DOES COME IN THESE BIG STORMS AND STORING IT UNDERGROUND TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER BASINS. AND SO THIS PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT PLANNING ENGINEERING ANALYSES AND CONSTRUCTION THE CAPTURE THOSE WINTER STORMS UNDERGROUND AND RECHARGE GROUNDWATER BASINS. I AM DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES IS DOING A REMARKABLE JOB IMPLEMENTING SICK MOM THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT AND MY COLLEAGUE KARLA NEMETH WHO DIRECTS THE W. OURS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ON THE- BYE IT'S- THAT NOT ONLY THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE THAT IT'S FOCUSED ON STAYING ON SIGNUP- WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS. HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED IN IN PAST YEARS- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP LOCAL GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES IMPLEMENT SIGMA SIGMA. BUT WE KNOW THAT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ALONE IS NOT GOING TO BRING TO STAND UP THE SUSTAINABILITY OR SUSTAINABLE YIELD TO BASINS IN OTHER WORDS BRING BASINS TO. A POINT WHERE THEY CAN SUSTAIN WATER USAGE THROUGH UNDERGROUND OUR WATER USAGE IN COMING DECADES WE ALSO NEED TO REDUCE GROUNDWATER PUMPING. AND THIS BUDGET WOULD HELP COMMUNITIES PREPARE TO REPURPOSE FARMLAND WHERE GROUNDWATER USE IS UNSUSTAINABLE. YOU KNOW THAT LAST YEAR AGAIN THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP THE BUDGET INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP COMMUNITIES PLAN FOR CHANGES IN LAND USE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WITH IN OUR AGENCY EXPECTS TO AWARD GRANTS IN MAY ARE TO ALLOCATE THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS PROPOSED ANOTHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO EXTEND THIS EFFORT TO HELP RURAL COMMUNITIES PROSPER EVEN AT SOME OF THIS LAND GOES OUT OF FARM PRODUCTION. OUT TO BRING GROUND USAGE INTO BALANCE. OTHER NEWS THE ALSO. A SOME FIVE DOLLARS TO HELP OUR DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO YOU AND GET AHEAD OF DROUGHT IMPACTS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. ON IT WOULD WOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE HATCHERIES AND ECOLOGICAL PRESERVES. ADDRESSED HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS INCLUDING THE BERIKAN BEAR HUMAN CONFLICTS THAT I'VE GOTTEN SO MUCH ATTENTION IN TAHOE. HELP PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TAKE ACTIONS TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE. REMOVE OBSTACLES TO FISH PASSAGE LIKE OBSOLETE DAMS AND BARRIERS AND RESTORE HABITAT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY SO IMPORTANT. AND CHUCK BONHAM OUR COLLEAGUE WHO NEEDS AN APARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE IS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IT'S REMARKABLE WITH DFW CONTINUES TO DO. IT IN ADDITION TO THAT THOSE PROPOSED FUNDING WITHIN THE SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO REPLENISH TWO REALLY IMPORTANT DROUGHT RESPONSE PROGRAMS. I WANT URBAN LARGER URBAN WATER AGENCIES WANT A SMALLER WATER AGENCIES- SIGNIFICANT FUNDING WAS. ALLOCATED TO THOSE PROGRAMS IN THE LAST- LAST FALL AND LAST SUMMER AND FALL. IN OTHER WORDS ABLE TO BE SPENT THIS YEAR AND SO FAR THIS YEAR D. W. R. HAS RELEASED FIVE ROUNDS OF GRANT FUNDING. NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES LEAKING PIPELINES AND STORAGE AND STOP STORAGE TANKS AND OTHERWISE KEEP DRINKING WATER FLOWING WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. NDW ARE HAS AWARDED AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN MULTI BENEFIT DROPPED REALLY PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT WATER LARGER WATER SUPPLIERS. SO AGAIN THIS COMBINATION OF FUNDING FOR A CUTE DROUGHT RESPONSE. ALL BUILDINGS ARE. RESILIENCE MY CHAIR THEY SEVEN ON FIFTY DOLLAR INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF CONTINGENCY THAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE ALLOCATED AS PART OF THE SPRING BUDGET PROCESS OF COURSE WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THE JAN TEN BUDGET IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW CONDITIONS WOULD FALL THIS WINTER AND WE WANTED TO MAINTAIN A THIRD OF OUR PROPOSED ALLOCATION THE NEW ALLOCATION OF SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO. A CONTINGENCY THAT THEN WILL BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL THROUGH THE SPRING BUDGET PROCESS GIVEN THE EVOLUTION OF HYDRO PRODIGY THIS WINTER ARE VERY CLEAR AGAIN THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO THE THIRD YEAR OF WORSENING DROUGHT AND IT'S VERY LIKELY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE QUITE HELPFUL TO HELP US RESPOND TO DROUGHT. AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S HAS NOTED AND WE AGREE FUNDS USED TO PROPEL DROUGHT RESILIENCE ARE GOOD INVESTMENT. EVEN IF EVEN IF THE SPECIFIC FUNDS DON'T ALLEVIATE DROUGHT IMMEDIATELY. IT'S TRULY YEAR ROUND WORK AND IT'S I WOULD SAY CHANGE HAS CREATED A NEW NORMAL WITH OUR WATER SYSTEMS AND WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR WATER SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. BOTH TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS NATURE I AND FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OF COURSE OUR OUR ECONOMY INCLUDING. AGRICULTURE SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO PRESENT THIS IS BUT- BUT AGAIN BOTH DIRECTOR NEMETH AND DIRECTOR BONHAM ARE HERE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS. THANKS SO MUCH. GREAT EXCUSE ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PRESENTATION AND FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE MANY ISSUES THAT YOU'RE- AGENCY NEEDS TO ADDRESS MANY OF THEM- AND CRISIS MODE. IF WE COULD GET- HOLD QUESTIONS I THINK IT TO ALL THE PRESENTATIONS OF THE DATE THAT WOULD BE GREAT- SO I THINK WE HAVE US SECRETARY ROSS SAID DITA NEXT TO PRESENT. TURNING CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES. SECRETARY CRAWFORD WHO ALWAYS DOES SUCH A GREAT JOB OF SETTING THE FRAME FOR OUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURE- CDFA IS REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM ARE SWEET PROGRAM- THIS IS ONE THAT WAS ONE OF OUR VERY FIRST CLIMATE SMART AT PROGRAMS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THE LAST DROUGHT- IT HAS INVESTED A TOTAL OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND HAS RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL WATER SAVINGS OF OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER IN ADDITION TO REDUCING ENERGY USE AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS SECRETARY CRAWFORD HAS POINTED OUT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FAIRLY TOUGH WATER HERE- THAT LAST TWO YEARS IN PARTICULAR AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HEADING INTO A PRETTY SEVERE SITUATION AGAIN THIS YEAR. JUST LAST WEEK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED- ISSUED A PRELIMINARY REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THANKS TO THE FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. MADE AVAILABLE TO US LAST YEAR. ON ITS FINDINGS FOR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE WATER YEAR. IS THAT THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES THAT WORK BALLOT- THE- PRIMARY BELLOWING FOR CRUDE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT THERE WAS ALSO CAN. RICE PAPERS THAT WAS VALID IN THE SACRAMENTO- RIVER VALLEY. AND THAT RESULTED IN A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR LOSS OF REVENUES ON. FARM INCOME. WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES THAT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF LEFT ANTI ACTIVITY AND HARVESTING ACTIVITY. THE TOTAL OF A HUNDRED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL LAST REVENUES. I'M FINE JOBS THAT LOST BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING. FOR ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED JOBS AND TOTAL LOST JOBS IS UP OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND TOPS. SO THE PRIMARY- ACREAGE THAT WAS FELLOW PRESS. COTTON FIELD CROPS THAT'S A LOT OF THE FORAGE CROPS WITH THE DAIRY SECTOR. AND THEN ANNUAL ROW CROPS LIKE MELONS POTATOES GARLIC AND ONIONS- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM FOR ON FARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAM. BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING TO REALLY HELP FARMERS USE EVERY DROP OF WATER AS CAREFULLY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. WATER USE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY ON OUR STATE BOARD OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- HEARING. YES PROP A LOT OF THAT THAT BROWN BUT SYSTEM. AGENCY THEY'RE FOCUSING ON IMPROVING WATER EFFICIENCY FIRST AND FOREMOST IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH FOR DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND REDUCING DEMAND ON OUR GROUNDWATER BASINS. THIS IS FUND WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE A PROGRAM THAT IS CONTINUALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED WE HAVE JUST FINISHED- OF THE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO CDFA FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. WE WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED WE HAD APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE AND WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND REQUEST. SO WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FULLY ALLOCATE NOT ONLY THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT. WERE MADE AVAILABLE AND THE BUDGETAGREEMENT LAST YEAR FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. BUT IF THE TWENTY MILLION THAT BEEN PRETTY FOR THIS WEEK PROGRAM. THE OTHER BECAUSE FROM THIS FIVE MILLION FOR TO WRAP RELIEF SOURCE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS. WE KNOW THAT THESE KINDS OF CRISIS ARE HARDER FOR OUR SMALLEST. AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THIS KIND OF SHOCK IT'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL ALLOW FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DIRECT RELIEF TO THOSE FARMERS WHO ARE ABSORBING INCREASED WATER COSTS INCREASED ENERGY COSTS INCREASED INPUT COSTS. AND SO IT'S PLAN DOLLARS WILL FOLLOW A PATTERN THAT WE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR IT'S OUR CALIFORNIA UNDERSERVED PROGRAM THAT REACHES FARMERS AND THE MOST HARDEST TO REACH COMMUNITIES. TO DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCTIVE. AND WHAT'S THAT- I WENT. THAT'S WHAT QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE I'LL HAVE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE TECHNICAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT UP WE HAVE- I LEAN SO BACK THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- GOOD MORNING- CHARTWELLS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND TESTIFY TO THAT. COULD I ASK YOU TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOUR MICROPHONE OR FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT THE VOLUME. AND COULD YOU ASK THEM TO TURN THE CAMERA INTO IT'S A LOT EASIER TO BE TO READ A LOT ALSO- THANK YOU YOUR CAMERA AND IF THAT'S POSSIBLE- LIKE NUMBER IS ON IT'S SHOWING. IT'S SHOWING MY VIDEOS BEING ON EITHER YOUR PHONE NOW. IT CAN YOU HEAR ME BETTER NOW A LITTLE BIT BETTER IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT ON THE QUIET SIDE. I WILL I WILL SHOUT- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY- THE HE ASKED- BUT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD TODAY- AND LET ME JUST INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M EILEEN SUFFOLK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. ARE ASKED TODAY IS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL LISTINGS FUNDS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND REGIONAL COUNTY BASED DROUGHT EMERGENCY PROGRAMS AND TO SUPPORT INTERMENT PROMINENT SOLUTIONS FOR DRINKING WATER AND DROUGHT AND ESPECIALLY. FOR WHAT IT WATER OUTAGE EMERGENCIES SO OUR FUNDING REQUEST AT THIS POINT IS TO- AUGMENT THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THIS YEAR OF. WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERS ARE LIKELY IS LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER- VERY CHALLENGING YEAR. IT'S MODEL AFTER OUR EXISTING SUCCESSFUL FUND AND PROGRAMS RUN BY SELF HELP ENTERPRISES IN EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. I'M IN WHICH WE HAVE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS- AND ROLLED WHEN WE HAVE EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS I'M IT IS OFTEN INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLD WELLS THAT BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT. AND ART- OUR GOAL IS TO- IDENTIFY THE PLACES THAT THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- HE- NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT HOUSEHOLD ABLE TO. HAVE ACCESS TO STATE THE CLEAN DRINKING WATER DURING THE DROUGHT THESE ARE INTERIM MEASURES- THAT WILL BE FUNDED BY THIS REQUEST. WE ARE WORKING ON MORE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS WE'VE RECEIVED FUND IN THE PAST FROM THE STATE IT. ALSO FROM FEDEAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS- WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO WORK- DILIGENTLY ON LONG TERM RESILIENCE MEASURES- SUPPORTING THE. THE CONSTRUCTION OF- DEEPER WELLS OR- I HAVE HOMES TO WATER- AND THIS FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IS TO- BRIDGE THE GAP DURING DROUGHT YEARS UNTIL THOSE MORE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS ARE IN PLACE. THANK YOU THAT THAT CAN CAUSE YOUR REPORT. YES SIR I'M HERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ALONG WITH- MEMBERS OF MY STAFF EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE FOR A REPORTER ANYTHING TO ADD. GOOD MORNING CHURCH MEMBERS BRYAN FULLER DEPARTMENT FINANCE AT NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS POINT BUT PROVIDENCE HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU I'M FINALLY WE HAVE- RACHEL ELLERS- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ON MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RACHEL EHLERS WITH THAT. ANALYST'S OFFICE NICE TO SEE YOU ALL- WE THINK IN THINKING ABOUT THIS PACKAGE IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO USE THE FRAMING THAT SECRETARY CROWFOOT SET UP ABOUT. HOW MUCH IS FOR IMMEDIATE URGENT DROUGHT RESPONSE AND THEN HOW MUCH IS FOR KIND OF LONGER TERM. I DROUGHT RESILIENCE SO CLEARLY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS SET ASIDE. BY THE GOVERNOR IN HIS PROPOSAL IS. SEEMINGLY KIND OF MORE TARGETED THAT IN. TERM BACK IN JUNE AND WE WEREN'T SURE WHETHER THAT WOULD EVEN BE NEEDED I GUESS ONE SILVER LINING WE CAN FIND IN CURRENT CONDITIONS IS BUT AT LEAST BY THE TIME YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS WE DO HAVE MORE CLARITY TYPICALLY ABOUT WHAT THE HYDROLOGY. IT'S GOING TO BE FOR THE COMING YEAR AND IT'S- AS THE SECRETARY NOTED NOT LOOKING GREAT SO KIND OF KEEPING YOUR EYE ON THAT ON THAT FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR FUTURE DECISIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS PROBABLY THAT WILL BE MERITED. BUT OF THE FIVE MILLION IN SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IT'S REALLY IN OUR CHARACTERIZATION OF PRETTY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT THAT IS FOR THE IMMEDIATE- URGENT. WE HAVE. AROUND SIXTY FIVE. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE FOR MORE. SENATE URGENT. BUDGET YEAR. THE BEST MY- OF IT IS FOR A LONGER TERM. DRIVERS ON. THAT NOT A BAD THING AS THE SECRETARY NOTED I MEAN IS THAT THE BEST TIME TO. PREPARE FOR A DROUGHT AND RESPOND TO DROUGHT IS BEFORE IT HAPPENS BECAUSE THE PROJECTS TYPICALLY DO TAKE. PART IN SOME KEY YEARS TO DEVELOP AN PERMIT AND CONSTRUCT OR IF THERE ARE POLICY CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE- THAT SAID THAT YOU MADE A VERY SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENT AND DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE IN THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDING FUNDING EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION THAT WILL BE FOR THAT UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. SO EVEN IF YOU APPROVE NONE OF THESE NEW PROPOSALS THE STATE WOULD STILL BE MAKING REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THAT GOAL. TOWARDS BUILDING GREATER DROUGHT RESILIENCE. SO WE WOULD JUST ADVISE YOU TO WEIGH THIS AMONGST ALL OF YOUR OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES. SHOULD YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE GOALS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGES THE ONLY A BRIBE. OPTION AVAILABLE FOR YOU YOU CAN ALSO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THAT TO REFLECT YOUR PRIORITIES. IN PARTICULAR- WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE IT'S A PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT IN THIS PACKAGE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT- KIND OF ACTIVITY. WHICH AS THIS IS A VERY PROMISING FOR BOTH THE WATER SUPPLY AND WATER STORAGE. APPROACH BUT ALSO FOR OTHER BENEFITS LIKE FLOOD CONTROL SO THINKING ABOUT IF YOU WANTED TO DO PERHAPS GREATER INVESTMENT IN GROUNDWATER STORE AT RECHARGE PROJECTS. IN CONTRAST YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A SMALLER INVESTMENT IN WATER CONSERVATION GIVEN HOW MUCH WORK THE STATE HAS DONE. EIGHTY THREE POLICY CHANGES AND HOW MUCH PROGRESS. WE HAVE SEEN IN REJECT AND IN WATER USE AND IN. EFFICIENCY IN THE URBAN. AND GIVEN THAT THE URBAN SETTING IS ROOM IS ABOUT. SMALL SHARE OF OVERALL WATER USE AS COMPARED TO AGRICULTURE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE. OF THE LABOR PURPOSING PROGRAM THAT THE SECRETARY MENTIONED IT SHOWS A LOT OF PROMISE BUT WAS JUST STARTED LAST YEAR WE STILL DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF. HOW THAT PROGRAM WILL SHAPE UP WITH THE DEMAND IS SO YOU COULD THINK ABOUT KIND OF WAITING TO SEE HOW THE FIRST ROUND AND FIRST YEAR ON THAT PROGRAM GOES BEFORE MAKING FURTHER INVESTMENTS. SO IS IT REALLY A LOT OF OPTIONS BEFORE YOU AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR ACHIEVING THESE IMPORTANT GOALS ARE. WE WOULD OF COURSE ALSO REMIND YOU THAT THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR GAN LIMIT IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AGAIN THIS YEAR SO THINKING ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT CATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE. HOW THAT WILL FOCUS AFFECT YOUR OVERALL GAN OR SELL THEM THE PACKAGE AND REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT THAT WE WOULD MAKE IS JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT. AT WHEN THE STATE HAS IN THE PAST PASSED A LARGE WATER BONDS THERE'S A LOT OF OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE TYPICALLY. THIS WAS ALMOST LIKE A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR WATER BOND THAT WAS PASSED. IN IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR BUT DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING LANGUAGE BUILT IN. SO THAT'S WHY THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL ABOUT PROVIDING A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH FUNDING HAS HAS BEEN COMMITTED ALREADY BUT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF REPORTS THAT WE WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE REQUESTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION NOT JUST BECAUSE GOOD OVERSIGHT OVER SPENDING IS GOOD GOVERNMENT TO AND ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION CAN REALLY HELP GUIDE YOUR FUTURE DECISIONS NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR BUT IN THE COMING YEARS ABOUT. WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES WHERE IT'S HARD GETTING FINDING OUT THE DOOR- WHERE THERE MAY BE VERY OR REAL SUCCESS. AND I CAN'T IT. AS YOU'RE MAKING FUTURE. SPENDING DECISIONS. SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT REPORT AND- LET ME BEGIN BY AGREEING WITH YOU I THINK THAT HAVING THAT- INFORMATION. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND IMPORTANT. AND- LET'S JUST- PUT IT OUT THERE THAT I'M TAKEN THAT REQUEST. NOW A SECRETARY CROWFOOT I DO HAVE A COMMENT- ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. ORDER OF A BILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY- ON DROUGHT I- COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH RESPECT TO THE DROUGHT BUT- ON THE FLIP SIDE. BOB IF WE WAIT UNTIL MAY REVISE TO- THINK ABOUT AND DISCUSS- WHAT THIS QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED FOR THAT'S PRETTY LATE IN THE GAME I MEAN MAY REVISE IS ALREADY- A BIG RUSH TO THE BIG COMMENCES A BIG RUSH TO THE- TO THE FINISH LINE- ON IT IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THIS CONTINGENCY FUND IF WERE. WAITING TO UTILIZE IT FOR- TO ADDRESS WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE AT. A LATER TIME THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS FOR URGENT NEAR TERM USES. AND THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST SOME UNDERSTANDING GOING INTO- AND THE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE MAY REVISED. WHAT THE TRIGGERS ARE WITH THE METRICS ARE FOR THE USE OF- OF THAT MONEY IS THAT SOMETHING. THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN GET TO US- SHORTLY. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL MAY. WELL THANKS FOR THE COMMENT AND POINT WELL TAKEN THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO IS JAM THE DISCUSSION ON SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING- AT THE SAME TIME OBVIOUSLY WE WANTED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE EVOLVING AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BACK IN DECEMBER AS WE ARE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. IT WAS THE ONE OF THE SNOW YES AND WHAT IS DECEMBER THAT WE HAD SO WE JUST WEREN'T SURE YOU KNOW HOW AND IF AND HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE NEEDED THAT BEING SAID I WILL WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON YOUR REQUEST TO AS I UNDERSTAND IT SORT OF FRAME OUT ARE FLUSH OUT. OUR APPROACH ON THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE THE MAY REVISED PROCESS SO YOU CAN PROVIDE INPUT AND ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE DIRECTION WE'RE MOVING ON A TWO FIFTY APPROPRIATE SO I WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT AND I WILL TAKE THIS MESSAGE TO THE TOP OF. THE FOOD CHAIN HERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCED I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN. WELL WE HAVE. AS YOUR- WE HAVE OUR I MEAN NO ALTERNATE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SET AN EXPECTATION THAT WE CAN'T MEET AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE ARE OBVIOUSLY ARE KEY PARTNERS ON. ALL HEALTH RELATED TO THE BUDGET. AT IT WITH. A AN ATTEMPT AT HUMOR SECRETARY SAID OKAY. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING RISK- A TO THAT REQUEST. MISTER BENNETT I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WHAT YOU PICK UP FROM HERE. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR BLOOM- AND I PARTICULARLY SECTOR CROW PUTS SERVE OPEN US IN TERMS OF TRYING TO WORK- WITH THE COMMITTEE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO- JUST WOULD ADD ONE THING- THE FOLLOW UP IN A CHAIR BLOOM SAID COMMENTS AND THAT IS- YOU KNOW THE QUARTER OF BILLION DOLLARS SAID THAT SHE'S REFERENCING. IN DECEMBER WE CERTAINLY HAD A VERY WET DECEMBER AND IF WE WOULD HAVE HAD YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS OF THAT WE WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION NOW BUT- I THINK WE'RE PRETTY LATE IN THE RAIN CYCLE AT THIS POINT TIME. AND SO WE KNOW WE HAD TO WHICH YOU KNOW VERY DRY- JANUARY AND FEBRUARY- SO WITH IT SEEMS THAT. WE WOULD WISH IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD HAVE- BE A BETTER A NOW. IN OTHER WORDS UNLESS SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT SEEMS LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO START TO. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SITUATION IS WHICH IS IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO. I'LL LEAVE THAT THERE- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ROAD- THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE- AND IT YOU KNOW IN THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING- THAT IS OUT THERE IT'S IDENTIFIED THAT- THERE IS JUST- INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY- IN TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO ADMINISTER ALL THINGS WE HAVE TO DO AND AS A RESULT. WE DO HAVE- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS FOR CONSULTING. AND IS THERE A- HIT I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHY WE INVEST THAT WAY AND NOT JUST BUILD UP THE CAPACITY. AND I HAVEN'T NUMBER QUESTIONS ALONG THIS LINE. AND I GUESS I WOULD BUT PREFACE THAT MALL BY SAYING THIS. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE CALIFORNIA IS NOT JUST IN A DROUGHT BUT IS IN A PERIOD OF CHARACTERIZATION. OF WHICH THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT DROUGHT BEING TEMPORARY AND WE'RE GONNA GET BACK TO QUOTE NORMAL. AND THERE IS ASIAN BEING THIS IS THE NORMAL. WHERE WHERE ARE RIGHT NOW. IF THAT'S THE CASE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO REALLY HAVE TO BEEF UP. ALL OF OUR- WHEN IT COMES TO WATER AND THAT MEANS ALL OF THESE AGENCIES I THINK NEED TO BE MORE ROBUST- AND BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL OF THIS AND SO- IS THIS THE TIME FOR US TO BEGIN TO AN- INCREASE CAPACITY. IN THESE AGENCIES- BECAUSE MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN- WHEN WE RELY ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS- WE HAVE. SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT WE ALSO LOSE ALL THE EXPERTISE- BECAUSE THE CONSULTANTS CHANGE EXCEPT OR A- THEY DON'T HAVE THE LONG TERM INTEREST- NECESSARILY OF- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THINGS WORK SO- THAT WOULD BE- I'D- I'D LIKE TO HEAR. A RESPONSE IF I COULD ABOUT. THOUGHTS ON IN IN INCREASING CAPACITY VERSUS- HAVING A ONE TIME FUNDING GOING FOR EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS. AND I KNOW CAPACITY MEANS GOING FROM ONE TIME FUNDING TO ONGOING FUNDING- SO DEPARTMENT FOR. I SEE IF I COULD. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR IF I MIGHT. AND IT MAY TAKE A MINUTE FOR THIS IS CHUCK BOND THERE'S THE VIDEO I CAN SEE IT. BUT SO MY NAME'S CHUCK BONHAM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND THEN ALSO REFER- TO DIRECTOR NEMETH TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS SO CALLED NEW NORMAL WE'RE SAYING. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT THREE RESPONSES FROM MAY FIRST SIGN ME UP THAT'S THE BUILDING AND THAT IS AT THE CORE OF OUR SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EXERCISE. WHICH IN A COUPLE OF AGENDA ITEMS I'M GOING TO GIVE A FULLER PRESENTATION ABOUT. SECOND IN THE CONTEXT OF DROUGHT THOUGH I WOULD ARGUE. YOUR PAST INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR. CAN YOUR POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OF ANOTHER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO OUR DEPARTMENT. TAGS A NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING HERE'S HOW. YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED FUNDING FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER THE DROUGHT WE HAVE. REDUCED OUR WATER USE ON OUR ARE MORE EFFICIENT WATER USE ON OUR OWN ECOLOGICAL RESERVES WE'VE CONVERTED A LOT OF OUR DIESEL PUMPS TO SOLAR ARRAYS. WE'VE MODERNIZED OUR HATCHERIES AND ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE FUTURE PROOFING STATE ASSETS FOR THE NEW NORMAL AND WHEN YOU TAKE A ONE TIME CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN YOU MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE HELPING US BRIDGE OUR GAP IN OUR SERVICE THAT'S A PROVEN TACTIC THAT DELOITTE. ANALYZED IN THE SERVICE BASED BUDGET PROCESS OUR POINT. ASKED TO CONSULTANTS. LET ME CLARIFY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED ADDITIONALLY FIRE DEPARTMENT. WE VALUE PARTNERSHIPS AND THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN REALLY I THINK MORE THAN CONSULTANTS HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES. CURRENTLY WE'RE ENGAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO DO SOMETHING CALLED REVERSE AUCTION BIDS. WORKING WITH RICE GROWERS AND KIND OF THE LOWEST BID STRUCTURE REVERSE AUCTION TO HELP FUND THE WEDDING UP OF SOME WEAPONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR PACIFIC FLYAWAY BENEFIT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PARTNERSHIP THE BIGGEST CONTIGUOUS WETLANDS SOUTH OF THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA IS OWN AND MANAGED BY A DISTRICT CALLED GRASSLANDS ARE DISHING DISTRICT. WE ARE USING SOME OF THE CURRENT FUNDING YOU SUPPORTED TO HELP MANAGE THEIR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BIRDS PACIFIC FLYWAY TO SEND OUT CAPACITY THROUGH CONSULTING AND IT'S MORE WE'RE PROPOSING PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE STRATEGIC AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING TOOLS IDENTIFIED BY DELOITTE. THERE FOUR WAYS YOU CAN BRIDGE OUR CAPACITY GAP. YOU CAN INVEST IN LABOR HOURS. YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL OF OUR MANDATES AND DETERMINE THAT SUMMER OLD NOT RELEVANT IT COULD BE CHANGED THIRD YOU CAN MAKE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOURTH YOU COULD INCREASE YOUR PARTNERSHIP FOR. SO THE DROUGHT FUNDING WE SEE REALLY FOCUSES IN ON THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPANDED OUR PARTNERSHIPS WHICH BUILD CAPACITY IN THE LONG RUN. I LOVE A CHANCE TO COME BACK LATER PERHAPS ONE ON ONE IF YOU HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS JUST ABOUT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT MORE. THAN A COUPLE OF AGENDA ITEMS IF I COULD CHAIR I'D LIKE TO REFER TO DIRECTOR NEMETH. JUST FOR A QUICK SNAPSHOT ON THIS NEW NORMAL WHICH IS. YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF HYDROLOGICALLY AND MEDIA ARE LOGICALLY TERRIFYING AND I THINK THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT. THE BETTER EVERYONE WILL BE. YES PLEASE. GOOD MORNING- ASSEMBLY MEN AND- CHERRY BLOOM- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY THERE I ON VIDEO- VERY QUICKLY THE DEPARTMENT- IS DOING QUITE A BIT OF WORK AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S FUNDING LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY- FRANKLY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEW NORMAL AND IT THE LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION UP TO OUR WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO A COUPLE OF THE THINGS. OF THE ONE IS WE ARE INVESTING IN IMPROVEMENTS TO FORECASTING FROM THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY THROUGH ITS FLOOD MANAGEMENT- CANDLES FORECASTING- BEFORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT- NOT JUST TO- D. W. ARE THE STATE WATER PROJECT BUT ALSO MANY MANY LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL WORK THEMSELVES THEY RELY ON THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE THEIR OWN WATER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD OF LAST YEAR- AS YOU KNOW AND THIS YEAR- IN TERMS OF DROUGHT RESPONSE THERE'S- AT ALL LIKELIHOOD WHEN THE HYDROLOGY DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH WATER FOR ALL LEGITIMATE WATER NEEDS OF TYPICALLY THE WATER BOARD GOES THROUGH OUR A CURTAILMENT PROCESS AND ALL OF OUR FORECASTING INFORMATION HELPS THE WATER BOARD ALSO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DETERMINATIONS SO THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR FRANKLY IN REAL TIME IS MOVING TOWARDS- ARIEL SNOW OBSERVATION. SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE- YOU KNOW WE'VE RELIED ON- BOTH OUR PHYSICAL- OUR OUR PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF SNOWPACK THAT'S THE THING THAT REALLY ATTRACTS A LOT OF- SORT MEDIA IT'S JUST VERY ACCESSIBLE WHERE WE GO WITH THESE TOOLS AND. WE- WE MEASURE THE SNOW WHY CON. THE DEPARTMENT BEEN DOING THAT- FOR. WE HAVE AN AND- A RESOURCE OF DATA- I'M GOING BACK TO- ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED YEARS WERE WERE- WE'RE MEASURING PHYSICALLY AND ALL THE SAME LOCATION SO WE UNDERSTAND SNOW PATTERN WITH THIS YEAR- BUT WE ALSO- YOU SNOW SENSORS- WHAT WE LEARNED LAST YEAR- WHAT IS THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. I'M LAST YEAR WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE- IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING SNOW PACK AND- WHAT IT WOULD TRANSLATE IN TERMS OF- RUN OFF INTO RIVERS STREAMS AND RESERVOIRS SO THIS YEAR WE'VE ADDED- THIS ARIEL SNOW OBSERVATORY. THAT CAN LOOK AT THE SIERRA- ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP- IN PARTICULAR WATERSHEDS AND IT ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY- HOUSE OF THE LINE FOR SNOW PACK IS RETREATING FURTHER UPS UP THE SLOPES OF THE SIERRA. AND WE CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVELY ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND WE CAN ALSO ANALYZE IN THREE METER GRIDS THE SNOW WATER CONTENT DOWN TO ABOUT AN INCH OR TWO. SO IT'S AN AWESOME- A SET OF TOOLS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DEPLOYING MORE WIDELY THIS YEAR TO INTEGRATE INTO OUR FORECASTING. OF THE SECOND THING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THE THREE YEARS OUT. BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMPLEX IS INTEGRATING INTO OUR MODELING SYSTEMS THAT SOIL MOISTURE IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY CAPTURE WHAT'S HAPPEN WHEN WE HAVE THE SNOW PACK. WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT'S GOING TO SEEP INTO THE GROUND AND EVAPORATE AMIDST- INCREASING AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND FRANKLY INCREASING LOW TEMPERATURES ON AVERAGE AND WE'RE VERY MUCH. SEEING THAT TREND- THAT WILL REQUIRE A PEER REVIEW- THAT. IS A REAL ADJUSTMENT TO IN HISTORY STAND- CAL IS VERY MUCH THE- IN THAT KIND OF WORK HAVE A LOT OF PARKER IN THAT WORK. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PARTICULARLY IN DENVER BUT ALSO- AT. AND U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING I THINK THE NEXT SET OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING WHICH IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL A PARTICULARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT- SOME OF THE PRODUCT CHALLENGES THAT. WE HAVE THE OVERDRAFT IN THE VALLEY OF CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO- REVERSE THAT TREND- LAST YEAR- THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT. WITH MONEY TO BUILD UPON SOME IMPORTANT PILOT WORK THAT WE STARTED- IN THE MERCED WATERSHED IN THE TWELVE. WOLLEMI RIVER WATER. WHERE WE GO S. HEADWATERS TO FLOODPLAIN AND WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND OTHER RISKS ON. ON WATER QUALITY ON THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE ON WATER SYSTEMS ON FLOOD- AND HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THAT WATER- TO MEET ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF. CLIMATE DRIVEN INTENSE DEMANDS BOB THE DEPARTMENT IS EXPANDING THAT RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS TO ALL WATERSHEDS THAT FEED INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL OF THOSE MAJOR WATERSHEDS. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION- NOT ONLY TO THE- GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES BUT ALSO THE SURFACE WATER- WATER SUPPLY DISTRICT IN THAT AREA. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT AND- AND EVERYONE'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT WATER. SCENE GOING TO BE A VERY PROMINENT THEME IN OUR- A CALIFORNIA WATER PLANTS WE ARE JUST STARTING THE UPDATE. ON THAT AS YOU KNOW THAT'S- THAT'S MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND YOU'LL SEE ALL THAT KIND OF ADVANCE PLANNING WORK. ON THAT HELPS US REALLY ADAPT THE NEW NORMAL IT WILL BE HUGELY IMPORTANT- AND WORKING- BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATIVE. BRANCH TO REALLY TARGET THOSE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. DESCRIBE THAT OR DETAIL. WELL THANK YOU FOR YOU VERY MUCH THAT I I'VE I APPRECIATE AS A SERIOUS A TOP AS IT SITS WORTH IT TO HAVE. A AUTHOR ANSWER WELL WITH REGARDS TO THE NEW NORMAL YOU'RE A DIRECTOR BOTTOM DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING THERE I THINK EMAIL THIS IS SECRETARY CRAWFORD I WOULD SIMPLY SAY AND APPRECIATE. CHUCKING CARLA'S YOU KNOW A DETAILED RESPONSE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN VERY LEAR WITH US WHICH IS YOU KNOW WE ARE NOW LIVING IN A NEW NORM ALL OF THESE CLIMATE EXTREMES AND WE HAVE TO MOVE FROM. DROUGHT RESPONSE TO DROUGHT MANAGEMENT. WE CAN NO LONGER DO WHAT WAS DONE IN RECENT DECADES WAS THINK ABOUT DROUGHT ISN'T AS AS AN EPISODE THAT HAPPENS ONCE A DECADE OR TWO. BUT RATHER- ESSENTIALLY- CONSISTENT OR CONSISTENT THREAT- ON OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT'S WHY ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS BOTH THE FISH AND WILDLIFE NDW ARE ARE SO IMPORTANT SO PLEASE KNOW. THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY RESPONDING TO THE ACUTE CONDITIONS IN THIS DROUGHT BUT ESSENTIALLY MODERNIZING OUR SYSTEMS TO ADJUST. TO THIS NEW NORMAL. THANK YOU I REALLY THAT. CROWFOOT AN IF I COULD MAKE THESE TO GENERAL COMMA AND ONE IS THAT. DEMOCRACY IS JUST DON'T NORMALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF PLANNING AHEAD. YOU KNOW WE ARE SO RESPONSIVE TO END UP AND THE PUBLIC DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO LOOK AHEAD. AND THE PUBLIC DOES WANT TO HEAR YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THIS HARD THING NOW THINGS WILL BE BETTER FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW AT THAT JUST DEMOCRACY DON'T DO THAT VERY WELL. IN THOSE OF US IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO DO AS MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE SO I APPRECIATE. THE GOVERNOR'S POSITION AND I APPRECIATE YOU COMMUNICATING THAT- THE- THE SECOND THING THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT AS YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL AND- THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE AS WE TALK ABOUT CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE HAVE TO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE HEARD OF OUR PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT SUSTAINABLE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE WEREN'T SUSTAINABLE. BEFORE THE NEW NORMAL. AND SO WE SORT OF HAVE A DOUBLE THE DOUBLE PROJECT AHEAD OF US WE NEEDED TO GET TO SUSTAINABLE IF WE WOULD HAVE STAYED IN THE OLD CONDITIONS AND NOW WE HAVE EVEN THE MORE EXTREME ISSUE OF. HAVING A NEW NORMAL HIT US ON TOP OF THAT SO THE URGENCY. IS- IT IS GOOD TO. COME AND IT IS LIKE THAT KIDS AND- OF THE LILIES ON THE THING THAT. THE DID DID DID NEED THE PUBLIC'S GONNA BE ON TOP OF THIS REALLY FAST- IF THE DIRE PROJECT PROJECTIONS- COME FORWARD. SO WITH THAT I HAVE I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY OTHER QUESTIONS VERY BRIEF- THAT IS FOR DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES- SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SMALL WATER SUPPLIERS DROUGHT RELIEF PROGRAM- I'M CONCERNED. THIS IS A CLASSIC WE WANT SMALL OR WATER SUPPLIERS ARE NORMALLY PROVIDING DRINKING WATER- TO COMMUNITIES- OF SMALL FARMS- RELY ON THIS. AND- IT HE SEEMS THE L. GREAT INVEST WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- HAVE ARE HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR- THE NEW NORMAL AND SO IS SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AND OFF TO MEET. ALL OF THE PROJECT APPLICANTS- APPLICATION TO FULFILL ALL THE APPLICATIONS CAN YOU GIVE ME A SCALE. THERE ON THAT- WHERE ARE WE ON PROJECT APPLICATIONS VERSUS- AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE. YEAH SO- IN TERMS OF- PROJECT APPLICATIONS SO WE HAVE- FUNDED THE SEVENTY ONE PROJECTS IN TOTAL- ABOUT A FIFTY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS SMALL PROGRAM- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE TWO MORE ROUNDS OF GRANTS AND SO WE WILL- I HAVE EXPENDED AND AWARDED ALL THE DOLLARS THAT WERE PART OF LAST YEAR'S APPROPRIATION. OF THE SIXTY MILLION MORE IN ADDITION- IT SHOULD BE- CONSIDERED IN COMBINATION WITH FUNDING THAT THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ALSO PASSED IN TERMS OF- RESPONDING TO SOME OF THESE- SOME OF THESE SMALL WATER SYSTEM ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY MEN. I'M A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO- IN RELATIONSHIP- WITH THE WATER BOARD IS FOCUSED ON- THAT DOLLARS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM COMPLIMENTING OR OR WORKING IN TANDEM WITH DOLLARS THAT THE WATER BOARD- HAS TO PUT TOWARDS SMALL SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION FOR EXAMPLE OR OTHER KINDS OF DRINKING WATER FOCUSED- DROUGHT RESILIENCE DOLLARS- INTERN. OF WHAT WE THINK YOU KNOW THE OVERALL- SORT OF APPETITE IS FOR THOSE THAT FUNDING- I WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU WHAT A DOLLAR ANSWERED TODAY BUT- AND WE CAN COME BACK AND TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. BUT WE THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT. AN ASSESSMENT OF- DROUGHT VULNERABILITY FOR THESE SMALL SYSTEMS AND WE EXPECT THAT ON THE THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE THAT WE WILL. ESSENTIALLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ABOUT THE TOP 10215% OF THOSE IDENTIFIED THAT SMALL SYSTEMS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND THEN TOGETHER WITH THE WATER BOARD- THERE'S PROBABLY IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OF. A SMALL AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS BEING. UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS SO WE THINK THAT THE SIXTY MILLION- WILL ENABLE US TO GET. A WHOLE LOT FURTHER- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS IMPLEMENTING- SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE TWO WHICH IS PUTTING TOGETHER A TASK FORCE- OF- NOT JUST STATE AGENCIES BUT LOCAL AGENCIES TO HELP DIRECT THE- D. W. R. AND- ALSO SOME OF THE WATER BOARD'S EFFORTS- TO. BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE- WATER SUPPLY NEEDS- FOR THOSE WERE ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITIES SO WE WOULD EXPECT- GETTING THAT- TASK FORCE UP AND GOING IT WAS- I'M STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF. JANUARY ONE- WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT- UP AND GOING AND AS- A MECHANISM TO HELP DIRECT FUTURE FUNDING- THAT MIGHT BE. NEEDED IN THESE KINDS OF COMMUNITY THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT PUSH TO AND CHAIRMAN GOOD A BLUE SAYS GOOD GREAT INTER ACROSS SO- I I'VE THIS IS THIS IS. THIS ISN'T A COMBINATION OF A QUESTION THAT THEY'LL DO IT IN THE FORM OF A COMMENT AND HOPE THAT- OF AGENCY- OVERALL WILL CONSIDER THIS BUT WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER- NOW- ARRANGE PAYMENT PROGRAM- AND I. I JUST WONDER WHETHER SOME OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION COULD INSTEAD BE USED IT TO SUPPLEMENT. A SIXTY MILLION GOING TO THE AND SMALL. DROUGHT RELIEF. THAT ACTUALLY- TO MILLION FOR WANTED SIXTY MILLION FOR THE OTHER BUT- AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THE LARGE- PUMPERS ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY SUCCESSFUL- AT- LOBBYING HERE BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THE SMALL WATER AGENCIES IN THE SMALL FARMERS THAT ARE- THAT WE WERE ALREADY SEEING STORIES OF YOU KNOW IF THE COMMUNITIES OF YOU KNOW THOUSAND FARM WORKERS AND- THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. DEEP IN THERE WELL THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THEY'RE LITERALLY OUT OF WATER I WANT TO MAKE SURE SO I HOPE THAT WE COULD INCREASE THE CAPACITY THERE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WITH THAT I'LL JUST JUMP OVER TO- TWO OTHER QUICK THINGS I HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF- CONSERVATION- WHEN THEY'RE AROUND LOOKING AT THE MULTI BENEFIT RE PURPOSING OF LAND- WOULD CONSIDER SOLAR FARMS ON THAT LAND IF WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW. FARMLAND WE HAVE HUGE ENERGY NEEDS AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR ENERGY NEEDS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE PLACES- FOR YOU KNOW FIGHT FINDING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LAND- AND IN APPROPRIATE PLACES AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CAREFULLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A WIN WIN ON BOTH SIDES SOLAR PANELS. AND FOLLOWING THE LAND- TO TRY TO HELP US WITH- THE WATER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND THEN- HE GIVEN HOW LONG THIS IS GOOD IT THE RIDGES BOXES OF BENTON AND DISK BEST PART A CONVERSATION I JUST WOULD SAY I AM VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT- SIGMA AND THE- PUMPING THAT IS STILL GOING ON AND SO. OF THESE THESE PLACES AND WE'RE HAVING OVER PUMPING AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE HAVING- DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES LITERALLY RUNNING OUT OF DRINKING WATER. AND- IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH WITH CIGNA- SO THAT WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE WITHOUT THOUSAND DOMESTIC WELLS GO DRY LAST YEAR- THAT. THIS COULD BE MANY THOUSANDS MORE THAN THAT IF THE NEW NORMAL CONTINUES- AND WE DON'T PUT A PRIORITY ON THAT SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN REALLY WE'D I DID JUST THINK THAT. OF THE TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME AND SIGMA IS- IS VERY GENEROUS AND TO WITH THE NEW NORMAL OUT THERE IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL PROBLEM FOR DRINKING WATER SO- THEY'LL BE MORE THINGS ON THAT THAT'LL BRING UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INDULGENCE OF JEROBOAM. YOU'RE WELCOME MISTER BENNETT- LET'S JUST QUORUM AND THEN WILL PURSUE WITH THE AS FRIEDMAN SCHOOL. WELL HERE SENATE HERE FRIEDMAN HERE QUESTION MULLIN. PATTERSON RIVAS SMITH YES. THIS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU I'LL BE HOME AT I HAVE A COMMENT AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION ONE QUESTION AND FOR I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING I WANT TO ON PARTICULARLY THINK THE SECRETARY WHO I THINK IT'S REALLY BEEN A AMAZING LEADER IN ALL THINGS RESOURCES AND IT'S ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM HERE- FIRST MY COMMENT IS THAT WE I THINK THAT AS WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WE REALLY DO NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER. THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WITH CLIMATE. AND WITH DROUGHT WHICH IS THE NEW NORMAL IS THE RESULT OF HUMAN. CAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S UNDENIABLE IF YOU BELIEVE IT ALL IN SCIENCE IF YOU THINK THAT NASA JPL- HAS ERA- IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PUT. A ROVER ON MARS LITERALLY ONE FOOT FROM WHERE THEY HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED YOU ALSO SHOULD TRUST THEM WHEN THEY HAVE THE MOST ADVANCED SENSING EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. ALL AROUND THIS PLANET AND SAY THAT THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE OF US HEATING UP OUR CLIMATE. AND SO ALL OF THE ALL OF US. WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SEE THE COST THE FINANCIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED. WITH THESE CHANGES. NEEDS TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT. ANYTHING THAT WE DO FOR RESILIENCY OR TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BEING TOO EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE THE COST OF DOING NOTHING OR CONTINUING AS WE ARE IT'S ASTRONOMICAL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO CALCULATE SO THAT'S MY COMMENT FIRST. SECONDLY I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT THE SECRETARY I THINK HE MAY HAVE REFERENCE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT LEGISLATION. MY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND SIX OH SIX. WHICH MOVED US AWAY FROM DROUGHT PLANNING INTO EFFICIENCY AWAY FROM CONSERVATION AND MORE TOWARDS INVESTING IN EFFICIENCY. AND MY QUESTION IS WHETHER. THE DO YOU HAVE YOU ARE IN THE STATE BOARD'S NEEDS MORE RESOURCES TO HELP. ROLL OUT THOSE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND JUSTICE CHECKED BACK TO SEE IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO. WORK TO QUALIFY THOSE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IN THIS BUDGET TO. REALLY GIVE OUR AGENCIES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN SO THAT WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY IN THIS. BILL OF TELLING EVERYBODY TO CUT BACK WHEN IT FOR MORE EFFICIENT WE HAVE MORE WHAT MORE WATER TO USE FOR THE THINGS WE REALLY NEED TO USE IT FOR. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WILL GO OFFLINE AND WITH YOUR ANSWER. ASSEMBLY I WANT TO TURN TO THEIR NAME AND POSSIBLY EXACT OFFERS SO BACK IN MOMENT BUT I JUST WANT TO. FIRST OF ALL COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AN UNDERSCORE YOUR POINT ON THANK YOU FOR CONNECTING THE DOTS. ON ACCELERATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THIS DROUGHT- A SCIENTIFIC STUDY FROM THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE- SEMINAL BODY OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS WEEK AND IT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE. A SMALL AND NARROWING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC WHILE WHILE. A CONSTRUCT A CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THIS IS NOT ONLY AN ISSUE OF SURVIVING AND THRIVING ACROSS THE PLANET BUT IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CONNECT THE DOTS SO EFFECTIVELY ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE AND EXTREME HEAT. OR SEA LEVEL RISE AND FLOOD SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE VISION AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION. CONSERVATION AS A WAY OF LIFE- PRESS IN BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE WORKING TO GET AWAY FROM HIS TEMPORARY CHANGES IN WATER USE AND MORE TOWARD. DURABLE WATER EFFICIENCY. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE WANT EVERYBODY TO DO IN CALIFORNIA IS B. AS EFFICIENT WITH WATER AS WE ARE WITH ENERGY. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF OUR POLITICAL IDEOLOGY NO ONE WHATEVER YOU KNOW LEAVE THEIR HOUSE WITH ALL OF THE LIGHTS ON THAT'S BECOME- YOU KNOW- INGRAINED IN ALL OF US TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. WE NEED TO BECOME MORE WATER EFFICIENT YOUR LEGISLATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT AND- DIRECTOR NAME AT THE QUESTION OF. WHETHER YOU IN THE WATER RESOURCE DEPARTMENT WATERBOARDING MORE RESOURCES. SURE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY- WE ARE ASSESSING- RIGHT NOW FRANKLY AS WE- CONTINUE TO PUT TOGETHER- OUR OUTDOOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS- AS YOU KNOW- THIS IS A- COMPLEX ARE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT- WAS MEANT TO- SET SOME STANDARDS- IN MULTIPLE WAYS ONE FOR INDOOR. ONE FOR OUTDOOR BUT THEN ALSO- PROVIDE WATER DISTRICTS WITH MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO WORK BETWEEN THOSE TO MEET AN OVERALL BUDGET- SO A COUPLE OF THINGS- ONE- IN TERMS OF THE OUTSOURCING- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING- IS THAT. THERE ARE SOME- START SIMILARITIES TO SIGMA IN THAT- WE DO HAVE A NEED TO COLLECT DATA ACTUALLY AS WE GO THAT INFORMS WATER USE EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES SO YOU WILL SEE IN- ARE. BUDGET FOR- A FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION PROGRAMS WE DO HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR- THAT SORT OF SET ASIDE IF YOU WILL FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO ADDITIONAL MAPPING- TO REALLY UNDERSTAND- ON SOME OF THESE LANDSCAPE ISSUES PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES WHERE I THINK WE THINK THERE'S SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING DOWN- OR TO IMPROVE WATER USE EFFICIENCY- ACROSS THE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S INFORMATION THAT WE YOU KNOW WE- NEED TO DEVELOP- AS WE MOVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING NEW STANDARDS- THAT MAY IN FACT- TRIGGERING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ONCE WE GET MORE DEEPLY INTO- INTO ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION- BOTH OF OUR- APPROACHES I THINK TOWARDS. INDOOR ARE INDOOR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT ARMOR OUTDOOR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE TO THE WATER BOARD HAVE KIND OF A TO A STUDENT THAT TWO STEP APPROACH ONE IS AN INTERIM EFFICIENCIES. AND THE TWENTY FIVE AND THEN A NEW STANDARD. IN TWENTY THIRTY TO HELP WATER- REALLY MAKE A PRETTY SICK. EVENTS TO OPTUM ALL THERE'S MORE EFFICIENT- AS WE SAY- THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. TO ACT IMPLEMENT THOSE- NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS- WE WILL CERTAINLY BE BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THOSE RESPONSES AND- LET ME ALSO CHIMED IN ON THE- IMPORTANCE OF- ADDRESSING THE- CLIMATE CRISIS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CHANGE THE NAME OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT- ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS REALLY IS REALLY- THE CORE BUSINESS. OF OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. I'M SORRY I COULDN'T AGREE MORE- WITH THE COMMENTS FROM LAST SECTOR CROWFOOT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FRIEDMAN WILL MOVE NOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH QUESTIONS UP FOR SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. THERE'S HARDLY ANY MONEY IN THIS BUDGET FOR STORAGE IN A WHAT POINT EVER GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT WARMER TEMPERATURES CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOW SNOW PACK. IN MORE PROLONGED DRY STRETCHES. WHEN IS THE STATE. GOING TO DO FOR MORE FOR WATER STORAGE AND CAPTURE WHEN WE DO HAVE WHETHER YEARS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT POINT AND LET ME BE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT MORE SMART STORAGE IS IMPORTANT I'M BY SMART STORAGE CERTAINLY WE MEAN UNDERGROUND STORAGE WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF CAPACITY IN OUR UNDERGROUND AQUIFERS. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO GET DEBATE THESE WINTER RAINS THIS WINTER STORM WHAT FLOWS UNDERGROUND. AND AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES DO THAT WE HAVE MILLIONS OF ACRE FEET OF CAPACITY OUR IN OUR UNDERGROUND WATER BASINS AND WE KNOW WE NEED TO RECHARGE THEM TO IMPLEMENT- SIGMA SO. BUT MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE NO BRAINER. IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE BECAUSE WE NEED TO ENABLE OR THE LOCALS NEED TO DO THIS RECHARGE IN WAYS THAT DON'T. IMPAIR WATER RIGHTS OF OTHER WATER USERS SO THERE IS A WATER RIGHT PROCESS THAT CAN BE COMPLICATED BUT- THE WATER BOARD'S DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE W. R. OF TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. I IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING SO UNDERGROUND STORAGE IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS REGIONAL STORAGE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY GREATER LOS ANGELES. IS A LOT MORE DROUGHT RESILIENT THAN IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO IS THEY INVESTED IN REGIONAL SERVICE STORAGE I INCLUDING DIAMOND VALLEY LAKE I BELIEVE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT REGIONAL RESERVOIR IN THAT AREA SO. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. THOSE REGIONAL PROJECT AND THEN ALSO I WOULD MENTION THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM PROPOSITION ONE THE STORE AT THAT WATER BOND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOUR SEVEN LARGE PROJECTS FOR UNDERGROUND THREE SURFACE STORAGE PROJECTS. TO GET THOSE BELT- THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW WE HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED RESERVOIRS ACROSS THE STATE. AND A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE WATER AND SURFACE STORAGE ARE ALREADY UTILIZED. SO WE DO WHAT WE DO THINK THERE'S. TARGETED SORT OF SURGICAL- X. OF SERVICE STORAGE THAT CAN DO. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE A BIG THRUST ON RECHARGING OUR UNDERGROUND STORAGE ABOUT COULD AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN IN A NEW TWIST TALKED ON PROP ONE FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IS EIGHT YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN. WAITING FOR THAT FUNDING TO GO OUT. IS IT MEANT TO NINE IS THE TEMPERATE FLATS FOR THE SITE PROJECT STILL MOVING FORWARD OR IS THERE ANY MOVEMENT. A CONNECT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE. RESERVE MONEY GO TO THE- WATER COMMISSION TO FUND THOSE PROJECTS. GREAT QUESTION SO BOTH OF THOSE PROJECTS WERE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED IN UNIVERSITY EIGHT PROJECTS THAT WOULD GET FUNDED BY EIGHT THIS PROP ONE FUNDING THIS SET ASIDE FOR STORAGE- THE TEMPERANCE FLAT PROJECT. DEVELOPERS THE PROJECT ALREADY ULTIMATELY WITHDREW THEIR APPLICATION FOR THOSE PUBLIC FUNDS- IT IN SHORT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY FOUND A FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE PATHWAY FORWARD FOR THE TEMPERANCE FLAT. DAM AND RESERVOIR THIS SITES PROJECT IS VERY MUCH MOVING FORWARD AND PASSED AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE WITH THE WATER I COMMISSION JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO- THAT IDENTIFIED OR VALIDATED THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF THAT PROJECT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PROP ONE WHICH WAS THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WENT TO THE VOTERS- WAS VERY VERY SPECIFIC I'M FAIRLY DIRECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN FOR. OUR THAT PUBLIC FUNDING ON THE SURFACE STORAGE PROJECTS AND IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME- WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IT'S QUICK YOU NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN. AT THE SAME TIME- OBVIOUSLY PROJECTS LIKE SITES NEED TO YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS SEE SO JUST KNOW THAT THE NEW SEVEN MINISTRATION IS WORKING TO GET THESE SEVEN PROJECTS THIS PUBLIC FUNDING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW GET COMPLETED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT'S A PRIORITY. OTHER THAT TWO HUNDRED MILE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. LET'S CUT CALL IT A RESERVE ACCOUNT FOR RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET WITH IT CAN BE USED FOR IT THE- FRANK KERN WALKING THE KERN CANAL. OR ANY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE BIG CONCERN OF MINE IS WATER STORAGE AND WATER CONVEYANCE. AND OF MY BIG FEARS WE HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE I COULD DOCKED IN THE DEBATE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WE'RE pWE SAVED KEEP YOUR WATER FOR YOUR OWN HOUSE FOR A FEW DAYS NOW IT'S A WEEK NOW IT'S A COUPLE WEEKS. WE'RE GONNA BE WITHOUT WATER FOR MONTHS IF NOT A YEARS. IT CAN ANY OF THAT THE ONLY BE USED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. FOR OUR- WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEM IN THE STATE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS THIS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY IS. AND FOR DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE NEW TO MINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK YOU KNOW ALL IDEAS WITHIN THE WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO ARE ARE ARE ON THE TABLE AND AS A CHAIR BLOOM NOTED. I THINK THERE'S AN INTEREST IN YOUR COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND OUR APPROACH IN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I WILL SAY DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES DIRECTOR NAME IS TEAM IS VERY CLEAR WITH US WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE AND REHABILITATE. OUR BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WATER CONVEYANCE WHILE REGION'S CAN YOU KNOW BUILT THEIR OWN RESILIENCE WE STILL NEED AS BACKBONE CONVEYANCE AND THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE. THE HOTTER NICE CONVEYANCE THROUGH THE DELTA UP TO PROTECT AGAINST EARTHQUAKE RISK AND SEA LEVEL RISE AND IT'S ALSO WHY I AM VERY PROUD OF THE FIRST TIME THE STATE IS FUNDING REGIONAL CONVEYANCE BROUGHT JACKSON LIKE FRYING CURRENT CANAL LIKE DELTA MENDOTA CANAL. LIKE THE STATE AQUA DOCKED. THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT SOUL I THINK WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT I CONTINUED INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN THOSE CONVEYANCE FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESILIENCE TO EARTHQUAKE RESILIENT. EARTHQUAKES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE YOU SECOND CRAWFORD. NOW I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CONVEYANCE AND HABITAT AGREEMENT AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOW MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS WERE COMPLETED WITH THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. A LITTLE OVER A DOZEN AND WE CAN GET YOU A SPECIFIC LIST OF THAT RANGE IN SCALE. IN SOME CASES A MUCH LARGER SCALE LIKE I MENTIONED WITH GRASSLANDS IRRIGATION DISTRICT. AND IN OTHER CASES YOU KNOW SMALLER ON OUR OWN DEPARTMENT PROPERTIES BUT WE'D BE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SPECIFIC LESSEN IT AND HOW MANY PROJECTS UNIT ANTICIPATE WITH A NEW FUNDING OF FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION FOR. TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. SAME ARE- I WOULDN'T SAY DOUBLE BUT CERTAINLY THE SAME AND WE'RE THE SAME PROCESS OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY- SPECIFICALLY WHERE WOULD MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS SO WE HAVE A FAST TURN AROUND BECAUSE WE'RE FIGHTING THE IMMEDIACY OF WHAT WILL BE THIS COMING. IN A DRY SUMMER AND BUILDING THAT LONG TERM RESILIENCY THE COMMITTEE'S BEEN DISCUSSING THIS ONE. OKAY THANK WON'T TAKE UP MUCH FOR TRAFFIC. THANK YOU- OF FOR A DIRECTOR SO BACK- THE A- AND RELATING TO THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GROUNDWATER CLEANUP AND RECYCLED WATER HOW DO YOU PLAN TO ALLOCATE BETWEEN THESE TWO PROGRAMS AT ALL- JUST GIVE YOU MY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT THAT- GIVEN THAT. THAT THE GROUNDWATER CLEANUP CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH MULTIPLE PROGRAMSAND- WATER DISTRICTS ARE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RECYCLED WATER TO ENSURE THEIR LONG TERM DROUGHT RESILIENCY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE THAT OF THE LION'S SHARE OF THAT MONEY BE AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS GIVEN THAT YOU CAN GO ELSEWHERE FOR- OF THE OTHER. PRIORITY. FOUR LET ME- LET ME- JUST- LOOK AT MY NOTES HERE- YEAH WE ARE IN THE BILL IN IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON HOW TO ALLOCATE- AT BETWEEN THOSE TWO VERY HIGH LEVEL AND PRIORITIES. AND OUR INITIAL STUFF LEVEL DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS- REGIONAL WATER BOARD STAFF THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL STAFF AND I WERE ALL HELD WITHIN THE LAST MONTH SO WE ARE- CONTINUE TO GATHER INFORMATION AND WE HOPE TO HAVE OUR DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS PUBLISHED IN APRIL SO IN A MONTH OR SO- FOR AND THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND THEN THE WORK WILL SOON THEREAFTER CONSIDER ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ON A REGULARLY SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING- SO WE WILL WE WILL LOOK AT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FREE SPENDING INCLUDING NON REPAIRABLE FUNDING- FROM THE VILLAGE OF- FEDERAL MONEY FROM THE STATE REVOLVING FUNDS BOTH THE DRINKING WATER AND- AND- CLEAN WATER FUNDS- AND CONSIDER WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR BOTH OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR THOUGHTS ON- HOW THAT WHAT HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DON'T GO AWAY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER TWO- AT THIS TIME AND THE- YOU'LL BE MAKING THAT PRESENTATION. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY- SO I AM. WE HAVE- WE HAVE ONE- REQUEST TIME UNDER THE BETA PROGRAM FUNDING- ADDING WHICH IS CONVERSION OF WHAT IS NOW CONTRACT UP FUNDING TO POSITION FORTY SO WE ARE REQUESTING THE AUTHORITY TO CONVERT. APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN EXISTING GENERAL FUND CONTRACTING RESOURCES TO PERSONAL SERVICES FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS WITHIN OUR DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS TO SUPPORT HIGH PART PRIORITY BIG DELTA WATER. WATER CONTROL PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION WORK- AND THIS ALSO INCLUDES- BUT I THINK ANY WOMAN TATIAN THAT IS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE DROUGHT AND WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION- IN THE BAY DELTA SEVEN THIS WOULD AND I THINK- DOVETAIL NICELY WITH SOME OF THE- CONCEPTS THAT- THE COMMITTEE HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY- THAT- THE OTHER- SPEAKERS HAVE HAVE MENTIONED. OF THIS WOULD REALLY AB WE REALLY APPRECIATED THE LEVEL OF CONTRACT FUNDING THAT WE'VE- OBTAINED IN THE PAST BUT WE REALLY NEED TO CONVERT THAT INTO A PERMANENT CAPACITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE. AFRIKAANS WORK INTO INTO REAL REAL IMPLEMENTATION SO IT WOULD IT WOULD ENABLE US TO MOVE FROM GENERAL PLANNING PLANNING PROCESS THESE. TWO IMPLEMENTATION IN THE DELTA ITSELF AND IT'S TWENTY FIVE. TRIBUTARIES HI THESE ARE LONG TERM EFFORTS. THAT WILL REQUIRE STAFF TO OVERSEE IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING MONITORING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE REVIEW. ASSESSED ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKS OVER THE LONG FROM OVER THE LONG RUN- IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE- THIS ARE VITAL TO STOP HAS ALSO BEEN VERY ACTIVE DURING THE- EXISTING. IN DEVELOPING. AND FORMULATING THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO IMPLEMENT CURTAILMENTS- THAT- HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE THAT IS ALSO VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY. WITH THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND THAT WE HAVE THE MOST EQUITABLE CURTAILMENT SYSTEM POSSIBLE- THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT. THIS IS CRYSTAL STRUCTURE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ELTA L. A- PLEASE. THANK YOU AGAIN RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE L. A. O. NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL HERE- YOU KNOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT'S POINT TO INCREASING DEPARTMENT CAPACITY RATHER THAN RELYING ON EXTERNAL RESOURCES. MAKES SENSE WHEN THERE'S AN ONGOING NEED WHICH WE SEE HERE I THINK THE MAIN POINT WE WANTED TO RAISE HERE AS HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA IS JUST. THIS IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT EFFORT FOR THE STATE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN THE DELTA. AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY FOR WATER USERS SO. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING WE GOTTA GET IT DONE- BUT WE'RE JUST MOVING FORWARD BUT JUST PROBING WHETHER THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS THE STATE AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO HELP EXPEDITE PROGRESS WHETHER THAT'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR ADDITIONAL STATUTORY CHANGES- BUT- BUT WHAT IS WHAT IS IT WHAT WE NEED TO DO THAT. TO MAKE FORWARD PROGRESS ON THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS WILL MOVE DIRECTLY ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE- AND- IS SELECTIVELY PRESENTING ON THAT AS WELL. SO THIS- THIS THIS LAST MATTER- HAS TO DO WITH- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WATER AND WASTEWATER A RICH- PAYMENT PROGRAM. AND- WE WERE I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR ABILITY TO GET OUT- WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR PAYMENT OF DRINKING WATER EVERY RICHEST IT WAS REALLY- HUGE HUGE EFFORT AND TOOK REDIRECTION OF A NUMBER OF OUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MET THE DEADLINE OF GETTING THIS MONEY OUT IN A TIMELY WAY TO WATER SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS. I'M A REGISTERED- CAN THE REGS THAT THAT IN THAT INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCRUED DURING OF THE CUPBOARD AND VIRGIN CITY. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE- THAT PROCESS OF GETTING DRINKING WATER. SYSTEM DOLLARS OUT TO GO TO A WE ARE JUST. YEAH IT'S NOW IN THE FINAL STAGES OF HAVING THAT CHECKS BEING CUT AND PAID OUT. SO WE HAVE CLOSED THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM- AND- WE HAVE NOW TURNED TO- PROVIDING. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WASTEWATER SYSTEMS TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS FOR THE SAME PURPOSES TO- TO PAY OFF A RELIGIOUS CUSTOMER REGISTERED ACCRUED DURING THE- TO STOP. TO SET MY MIND. WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO MAKE THE APPLICATION PROCESS STREAM STREAMLINED THE BASIC MINIMUM THAT WE CAN USE. WE'VE USED WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OUTREACH WORKING WITH TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT- EVERYBODY WHO IS ELIGIBLE ALL SYSTEMS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM AND THE DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND WE ARE WORKING AND- WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO- YEP TO COMPLETE THE WASTE WATER- PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM. HOW WE ARE OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT TIME IN ADDITION TO THE THREE HUNDRED- AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WERE GETTING OUT TO THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEM. THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY I'M- MILLION AN ESTIMATED- WASTE WATER DOLLARS- THAT COULD DOLLARS THAT GO TO WASTE WATER SYSTEMS. AND THAT THAT WILL LEAVE- SOME FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE THAT WILL HAVE NOT WILL NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE MOMENT. AND SO WE WILL. BE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND PUTTING TOGETHER IDEAS FOR- WHAT WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS- WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE- DRINKING WATER. SYSTEMS I DID WANT TO NOTE. THAT TIME- THAT. THE NUMBER OF WATER SET UP. ACCOUNTED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE HOUSEHOLD STATEWIDE THAT WERE SERVED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS SO WE THINK THAT WE DID WE WERE ABLE TO REACH. ARE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF. CUSTOMERS AND HOSPITALS THAT WERE AFFECTED AND HAVE BUILT UP- A RELIGIOUS AND WE WERE ABLE TO THROUGH PROVIDING DOLLARS TO THEIR WATER SYSTEMS TO GET FROM THE RELIEF THAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS- WITH APPROPRIATED- PART OF MONEY. SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS. NO COMMENTS ON THIS OVERSIGHT ITEM THANKS MISTER CHECK HELD- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ASSUME- NOTHING TO HAVE. THAT'S CORRECT AND HAVING INTERNET QUESTIONS. DRASTIC THANK YOU- WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. SECRETARY ROSS IS STILL WITH US I AM. I'VE LEARNED A LOT THIS MORNING- I AM HERE- TO PRESENT TWO ITEMS AS I LOOK AT THE AGENDA HERE THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE FARM TO SCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM I'M CITY IF THEY IS REQUESTING THIRTY TWO MILLION. EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND AND SIXTEEN POSITIONS TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA FARM TO SCHOOL INCUBATOR GRANT PROGRAM- JUST LAST WEEK WE RELEASED OF WHAT THE FIRST PARTNERED THE PLANTING THE SEED FARM TO SCHOOL BUT NOT FOR SIX SOUTH WHICH HAS HAD A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A VERY IMPRESSIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO REALLY FOCUS ON HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS- IMPROVE THE ACQUISITION OF LOCALLY GROWN HEALTHY FRESH CALIFORNIA PRODUCE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE EXPERIENCE A LEARNING FOR STUDENTS TO REALLY HELP CONNECT THEM TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. NUTRITION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. HOW OVER ONE BILLION SCHOOL MALES WERE SIR. LAST YEAR AND THEY'RE OFTEN PROVIDING TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THE ONLY MALE BUT THEY MAY HAVE IN THAT DAY. AND CLEARLY THERE'S MUCH WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE NUTRITION AND THE HEALTH OF THOSE STUDENTS AS WELL AS THEIR EDUCATIONAL LEARNING. CAPACITY IT'S VITAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT IN A STATE THAT GROWS- TWO THIRDS OF THE FRESH FRUITS VEGETABLES AND TREE NUTS. ALL THE HEALTHY THINGS THAT WE HAVE WE'VE GOT WE'VE ALREADY GOT MALCOLM'S PLEDGE PROGRAM BUT THERE'S SO MANY PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN REALLY EXPAND. AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC RETURNS TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY DOING MORE INSTITUTIONAL ACQUISITION. OF CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS. THIS IS THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IT'S IT THEN IT TO THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AGREED TO IN THE BUDGET. WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IN PARTICULAR. AND THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING THAT WE HAD. THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY DEMAND FOR THE US I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT WITH MADE BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WITH THE BUDGET WAS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HAVE A THREE YEAR PROGRAM TO INVEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE OUR KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF MAKING THIS WHOLE- PART SCHOOL PROGRAM. WORK TO OFFER MORE FROM SCRATCH COOKING TO OUR STUDENTS. SO AS WE FOCUS ON. OUR CLIMATE SMART. SYSTEM WHICH STARTS ON THE FARM AND CARRY THROUGH TO WHAT WE'RE OFFERING IN OUR SCHOOLS I'M FOR MAKING THIS REQUEST WITH REGARD TO THE SIXTEEN POSITIONS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY OF LINKING SCHOOL NUTRITION DIRECTORS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THE PRODUCT IT'S GROWN LOCALLY. AND ART FARMS WE WANT TO PUT A SPECIAL FOCUS ON OUR SMALL FARMS. ON OUR FARMS UNDERSERVED HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMERS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DIRECT LINKAGES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE REGIONAL NAVIGATORS. WELL REALLY ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT ONE. OR TWO THE SECOND ITEM THAT I WAS ASKED TO PRESENT ON- THIS IS FUNDING FOR OUR STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM THIS IS. THIS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THAT YOU'RE MOVING ON TO. I'M I KNOW HAVE THE ATTENDED FRONT OF ME. IT I CAN TAKE LIKE THIS NUMBER FOUR. BUT LET'S LET'S. AND AT A- HI- ISSUE THE ONE THAT YOU JUST SPOKE THAT- LET'S MAKE SURE- THAT WEEK- FIRST ALL ASK A L. A. O. AND TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO- ADD ANY COMMENTS THEY MIGHT HAVE. QUESTION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRANK MENACE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M A SECRETARY ROSS MENTIONED THIS PROPOSAL HAS TWO COMPONENTS FIRST THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ASSIST SCHOOLS IN IMPLEMENTING FARMERS GO PRACTICES I'M SUCH AS PREPARING LOCALLY GROWN FOODS IN PROVIDING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES- THIS WOULD BRING THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR GRANTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO SIXTY MILLION SINCE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION IN BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR SO THERE IS FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM GOING INTO THE BUDGET YEAR BASED ON ACTIONS TAKEN LAST YEAR. AND THEN SECOND THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWENTY EIGHT MILLION ONGOING TO HIRE SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WOULD SUPPORT- FARM TO SCHOOL EFFORTS- SO FOR THE GRANT TO RECOMMEND REJECTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING- SAID THAT AND ARE NOW IF THIS IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE WILL BE I'M DEMAND FOR THIS AMOUNT THE CURRENT YEAR GRANT CYCLE THIRTY MILLION I'M HASN'T BEEN AWARDED GET SO WE'RE ON SHARE ON ON WHAT THAT DEMAND FOR THAT WILL BE. INTERESTING AND THE DEPARTMENTS I'M FIRST GRANT CYCLE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- DEPARTMENT AVAILABLE NINE MILLION AND GRANTS BUT ONLY RECEIVED- TWELVE MILLION IN TOTAL REQUEST I'M OF THE NOTE THAT INCREASING THE PROGRAM- FROM EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION TO SIXTY MILLION OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD THE RELATIVELY LARGE INCREASE FOR- A RECENTLY ESTABLISHED PROGRAM- WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT REPORT ON PROGRAM OUTCOMES FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I'M FINE IT IS PREMATURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- WITHOUT THAT- PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOME INFORMATION EVER FOR THE ADDITIONAL STAFF WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE- APPROVE THE REGIONAL STAFF WE FIND THAT THE- THE STAFF COULD INCREASE THE ADOPTION OF FARMERS WILL PRACTICES STATEWIDE BY BETTER TAILING I'M SUPPORT TO THE SCHOOL TO HAVE COMMON- REGIONAL INFORMATION BARRIERS THAT HAVE TO TAKE ANY COMMENTS. AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD MORNING WITH THE AREA OF FINANCE NO BUT I'M HAPPY HELP IN ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOU HAVE A QUESTION IT INDIA EIGHT LAP L. A. O. N. ASK THE QUESTION THOSE WONDER OF SECRETARY ROSS COULDN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH THE AFTER FUNDING IT'S A 6100% INCREASE. AND WE HAVE NO OF MATRIX TO SEE IF THE SYSTEM MEANS IS A WORK. AFTER RAFI. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS METHOD APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION- WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT BASED ON THE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR TWO YEARS NOW. WE HAVE EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY THE FARM TO SCHOOL NETWORK. WE HAVE HOSTED OVER THREE HUNDRED NEW STAKEHOLDERS EXPRESSING THEIR INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM. WE KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF A PANDEMIC. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING THE NUTRITIONAL OFFERING TO STUDENTS. AND WE FIND THAT BASED ON EXTENSIVE SURVEY WORK. INTERVIEW WORK. AND BACK AND BACK HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH UR ADVISER COMMITTEE AND DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS STRINGS. THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. AND THE CAPACITY TO MAKE PROGRESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE BUILT AND FROM DAY ONE A VERY ROBUST. EVALUATION PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NOW AS WE GET MORE AND MORE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING ELSE. WE KNOW WHAT'S WORKING AND WE CAN BUILD ON THOSE SUCCESSES. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD ACROSS THE NATION. ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER AND THE DESIGN OF OUR EVALUATION PROGRAM AND WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE YEARS. TO GIVE YOU THE KIND OF DATA THAT YOU NEED. THAT IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST AND IN THE NATION TO DO THIS KIND OF AN EVALUATION. AND WHAT HELPED LEAD OTHER STATES AND OTHER SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND DOING SIMILAR PROGRAMS. FIFTY IT GOING TO YOU THREE YEARS OF GIVE US A MATRIX OF HIS WORK IN IN YOUR ONE YOU CAN'T OUT MATRIX EVERY YEAR THAT THAT'S GOING FORWARD TO A GOOD ME ASK FOR A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME MAYBE FIVE MILLION TEN MILLION INSTEAD OF. THIRTY I'M SORRY. I MEANT I MEANT THAT WE FEEL THREE YEARS OF DATA IS NECESSARY BUT WE WILL HAVE PROGRESS AND MILESTONES CHECK INS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- INFORMATION TO YOU. AS AS WE FINISH EACH YEAR. THANK YOU. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS CURRENT YEAR THAT APPLICATION PROCESS- WILL OPEN LATER THIS MONTH AND SO WILL WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT THE UPTAKE WAS AT THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR THIS YEAR. OKAY AS WE MOVE THROUGH BETWEEN NOW MAY WE'LL GET MORE UPDATES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND ALLOW ME TO FOLLOW UP- WITH RESPECT TO THE FARM TO SCHOOL REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED- RECENTLY THAT AT AND THAT MAKES A NUMBER OF POLICY SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR METRICS TO HELP DETERMINE SUCCESS- WHAT AGAIN IS THE UP A PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE- CHANGES DEFINITIONS ARE METRICS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED IN THE REPORT. YES I'M IT THAT'S A VERY GOOD RECORD WE ARE IN FACT GOING THROUGH OUR EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF THAT REPORT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALREADY WORKS IN PROGRESS- I'M VISITS COME OUT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH INPUT FROM THE DEVICE YOU GROUPS AND IT'S HELPED IN THE DESIGN OF THIS YEAR'S GRANT PROGRAM. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING AS MANY OF THESE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THE NEXT ROUND AND THEN OVER SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU- AND THEN- WITH RESPECT TO THE FARM TO COMMUNITY FOOD HUBS OF PROGRAM- THAT- FOLLOWS MY LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR- WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM- INCLUDING CUT. STAFFING FORMATION OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PUBLIC OUTREACH REGARDING GRANT AVAILABILITY. INFORMATIONAL WORKSHOPS FOR INTERESTED APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REVIEW AND DISBURSEMENT. YES SO WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THAT WE- DO YOU NEED TO ADD- STAFF FOR THAT PROGRAM AND WITH AUTHORIZATION- FOR STAFFING WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THAT PROGRAM TOGETHER BUT WE REALLY IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM- OR NOT ONLY OUR FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM BUT JUST OUR LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCY AND SELF. WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO DO EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WE WILL BE STAFFED UP IN JULY IT WERE USING SOME TEMPORARY STAFFING NOW ON TO DO SOME EVALUATIONS WE WILL FORM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH. PROCESS AND HAVE INFORMATIONAL WORKSHOPS WITH APPLICATION RUBIO AND DISBURSEMENT BAILABLE BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ESTABLISHING THIS PROGRAM OR EAGER TO GET TO WORK ON IT WE KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT THAT WILL HELP MAKE FARM TO SCHOOL EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT ALSO BRING SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES GOOD RESILIENCY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD- SANTA ANA NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO- ISSUES NUMBER FIVE SECRETARY ROSS THE OTHER ISSUE YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS. YES THIS IS OUR STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM AND IT'S FOR EDUCATION AND HELP REACH- THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. DOLLARS FROM THE AGRICULTURAL FUND FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND I'M GOING WITH ONE ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITION- THEY THE GROWTH IN OUR STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM AND THE INTEREST IN OUR CONSUMERS OF A QUERY MARC ORGANIC. PRODUCE AND PRODUCTS IS GROWING AT A VERY SIGNIFICANT RATE- WE HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE ARE WE CALLING MARCO CAPTIVITY YEP. THREE CALIFORNIA ORGANIC POLICY THE ADVISER. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY AND IN WHAT AT ALL WAY THAT CAN USE OF OUR- STREAM. TO BE ABLE BETTER SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING INTO THE ORGANIC- GROWING SECTOR OUR AREN'T SUPPORTING THOSE THAT ARE IN IT NOW. BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE NOW HAVE A GARDEN ORGANIC INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH COOPERATIVE EXTENSION THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS KIND OF WORK. AND SO THIS WOULD BE TO SUPPORT A STAFF MEMBER THAT WOULD BE FOCUSING ON OUTREACH EDUCATION- PUTTING TOGETHER CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS AND PARTNERING VERY CLOSELY WITH BOTH THE CSU. AT THE UC SYSTEM REALLY EXPAND THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND. TO DO THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HELLO. THANK YOU MINUTES AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- HAVE NO COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL I TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT. REVERE A FINANCE I KNOW COMMENTS AT THE TIME THAT HAPPENED TO QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX. DIRECTOR BONHAM YOU'RE BACK TIME ON ISSUE SIX I'D LIKE TO DO TWO THINGS WITH THIS ISSUE I'D LIKE TO START WITH AN UPDATE ABOUT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE FOR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS IN TODAY'S AGENDA THAT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO THE BUDGETING EXERCISE. THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU. SO HERE'S THE END OF UPDATE REPORT DYNAMIC. AND BY WAY OF REFRESHER FOR THOSE DIALING AND SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS- A MANAGEMENT EXERCISE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING CHAIR BLOOM INSTRUCTED US TO DO ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. WE HIRED A NATIONALLY KNOWN FIRM DELOITTE AND THEY TOOK US TO AN OPEN TRANSPARENT PROCESS IT INVOLVED ALL OF OUR- UNITY'S MANY OF YOUR BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP STAFF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND IT ENDED UP WITH THE REPORT. PROVIDED THAT TO THE LEGILATURE AND THAT THE TOOL THE TACTIC THE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT LOOKS AT AND ENTITIES LEVEL OF CURRENT SERVICE YOU DO THAT BY ANALYZING ALL THE TASKS YEAH IT'S A T. DOES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS CORE SERVICE AREAS SO WE ANALYZED APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND TASKS CONDUCTED BY OUR EMPLOYEES CAN YOU BATES STATIC YOU BENCHMARK AGAINST THAT LABOR HOURS. AND IT GIVES YOU AN ESTIMATE OF YOUR LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE OR SERVICE. AND THEN YOU DO AN ANALYSIS CREEK COMPARES TO YOUR MISSION YOUR ASSIGNMENT YOUR MANDATE YOUR EXPECTATION. AND YOU CAN ILLUSTRATE A GAP BETWEEN CURRENT SERVICE AND EXPECTED MISSION LEVEL SERVICE WE DID THAT. BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION I THINK IS WELL KNOWN NOW WE'VE BEEN TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT. WE HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD EIGHT SERVICE AREAS WHERE GENERALIZING WE ARE CURRENT STAFFING IS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMPLISH ABOUT 35% OF THE MISSION LEVEL ASSIGNMENTS WE'VE RECEIVED OVER THE DECADES. THE GAP IS GREATEST IN OUR AREAS OF SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND PERMITTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN FILL THE GAP I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER IN MY CONVERSATION WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS. SO WHAT WE JUST DID AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR STAFF IS SEND OVER- POWER POINT PRESENTATION THE SERIES OF SLIDES. THAT SHOW THIS DATA. AND A REFRESHED. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA. HE HAD A COUPLE OF THE SLIDES- SHOWED THAT DATA COMPARED IN NINETEEN. TWENTY DATA AND WHAT WE DO ANNUALLY NOW IS WE GO BACK TO THAT TASK REGISTRY OF THREE THOUSAND. WE GO BACK TO THE SAME MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS WE ASK THEM TO RE FILL OUT THE ESTIMATE OF LABOR HOURS RELATIVE TO THE TASK. WE'RE RUNNING WE TRAILER YEAR SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW DATA A YEAR OLD. WE HAVE A STAFF PERSON WHOSE SOLE JOB IS MANAGING THIS INFORMATION ON OUR AUTOMATED SYSTEM ENGAGING WITH OUR ENTERPRISE SOME OF THE THINGS WE SEE IN THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. IS THAT- WE SEE MOSTLY UP A SLATE- DECREASE IN OUR CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS SO A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE GAS. WE THINK THAT COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE JUST TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THE LAST YEAR AROUND THE PANDEMIC. THE GAP ACTUALLY GREW THE MOST IN OUR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SERVICE AREA AND WE THINK THAT IT IS IN PART POTENTIALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OUTREACH WORK WE DO REST ON VOLUNTEERS. AND KIND OF THE ABILITY TO USE A VOLUNTEER BASE LAST YEAR WAS COMPROMISED OR CHALLENGE BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMICS AROUND THE PANDEMIC. WE DO SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE MEETING OUR SERVICE LEVEL WENT UP. AND THE GAP SHRUNK A TOUCH OVER THE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION WORLD AND NOT MY ANALYSIS MY GUESS ON THAT WILL BE. IMPOSED IN PART IT'S YOUR LEADERSHIP AROUND- THE THIRTY NINE POSITIONS FOR OUR ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROGRAM. THAT REALLY SHOWS A CHANGE IN THAT COLUMN. WE WANT TO DO WHAT YOU'RE STAFF ASKS IN THE AGENDA SO I WILL MAKE THAT A COMMITMENT. INSTEAD OF SENDING YOU EACH YEAR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND WAITING TO SEE IF YOU'D LIKE THE SERVICE BUT IT BUDGET ANALYSIS RELATIVE EACH PROPOSAL WILL JUST MAKE. SENDING THAT S. B. B. DATA ARE STANDARD PRACTICE FOR ALL PROPOSALS WE BRING TO YOU. THE LAST THINGS I WANT TO SAY ON SERVICE BASED BUDGET BEFORE TURNING TO THE FOR BCPS IN THE AGENDA. STATE LOT OF CONVERSATION OCCURS REGULARLY I'VE LIVED THROUGH IT LIKE THE CHAIR AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE POTENTIAL FOR FEE INCREASES AT THE DEPARTMENT TO DEAL WITH THE GAP BETWEEN CURRENT IN MISSION. I JUST WANT TO. BE REALISTIC HERE. THE DEPARTMENT DEALS WITH SUNDRIDGE OF FEES ACROSS OUR WORK LOAD. LICENSES ENTITLEMENTS SPORTFISHING ALL THE WAY TO FEES AROUND. WE'LL BARRELS TO FIND ARTICLES SPILL RESPONSE WE KEEP TRACK OF THEM HAVE DONE DOZENS OF FEE INCREASES OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. MY ASSESSMENT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FEED OUR WY OUT OF D. SUSTAINABILITY DYNAMIC THEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISSION AND CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL PARTICULARLY IN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION REALM WHERE THE GAP IS THE LARGEST THERE'S NOT A USER FEE BASED AND OFTEN A USER FEE BASED CAN'T TOLERATE THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF FEES NECESSARY TO KIND OF MATCH UP MISSION AND CURRENT. SO I THINK THIS PROCESS IS REALLY REPEATEDLY ILLUSTRATED. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM PERMANENTLY REQUIRES THINKING THROUGH WHAT'S AN ADDITIVE LONG RUN SUSTAINABLE FUND SOURCE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE MISMATCHES. AND ON THAT FRONT CHAD NO- YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE SIDE I JUST GOT A WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING OPTIONS TO ADDRESS WHAT WE SEE IS THE GAP AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ADVANCE EFFICIENCIES AND MAXIMIZE EXISTING RESOURCES WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR ON THE THIRTY NINE POSITIONS FOR OUR ENDANGERED SPECIES PROGRAM. AND THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL TO MAKE THOSE POSITIONS PERMANENT IT'S AN ILLUSTRATION AS ARE SOME OF THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I REALIZE WE HAVE NOT YET COME WITH THE TROOPS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING OPTION ACROSS A LOT OF OUR SERVICE AREAS I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME IN A MOMENT. BUT BECAUSE THERE AND ASK THE PLEASURE THE CHAIR IF YOU LIKE ME TO TURN TO THE FOR BCPS. THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN THIS ISSUE OR PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS MORE BROADLY ABOUT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. NOT YOU CAN GO HEAD MOVE ON THE CHAIRMAN'S STEPPED OUT SO I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER SO GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE WITH THE ITEMS. THANK YOU NUMBER SMITH SO. THEN IN THE AGENDA THERE ARE FOUR IDENTIFIED BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WITH THE NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. LET ME EXPLAIN THE NEXUS AND EACH OF THE PROPOSALS FIRST WE HAVE- PROPOSAL FOR UP MODEST SOME MIGHT THINK OF EIGHT HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO COMPLETE A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT TO GET MORE PEOPLE OUTDOORS AND THIS IS TO EARN OUR FISHING LICENSES FROM CALENDAR YEAR. TWO EIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS FROM DATE OF PURCHASE OPPORTUNITIES SO HISTORICALLY YOU BY YOUR FISHING LICENSE IN THE MOMENT YOU BUY IT IT'S VALID FOR WHATEVER THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR IT'S SO IF YOU BUY IT IN JANUARY GET A FULL YEAR. IF YOU DECIDE TO GO FISHING IN OCTOBER AND YOU BY THEN YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE TRANSITION THAT TO. A PROGRAM THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING FROM THE MOMENT YOU PURCHASE IT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS BOARD IT'S VALID WE MAY SEE MORE PEOPLE BUY LICENSES WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR REVENUE. IN THE LONG RUN. THE OTHER CHANGE WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL IS- TO GIVE A DISCOUNT TO SENIORS FOR THEIR FISHING LICENSES NOW THIS ASPECT COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE WE DON'T YET KNOW. WHAT SENIORS WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE DISCOUNT BUT IT'S EQUALLY TRUE THAT DISCOUNT COULD MOTIVATE MORE SENIORS WHICH I THINK IS TO FIND A SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER SO A LOT OF GOOD FISHING TIME. FROM SIXTY FIVE ON. THE BOTTOM MORE LICENSES AND WE COULD SEE MORE REVENUE. SO THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ALLOWS US TO COMPLETE SOME OF THE BACK OF THE HOUSE TECHNOLOGY WORK AND GET THIS AUTOMATED WITHIN OUR LICENSE AUTOMATION SYSTEM. WHAT'S THE NEXUS THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. THIS IS ACTUALLY MANDATED BY THE BILL ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SEVENTEEN SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO FUND THE DEPARTMENT WORK TO AVOID AN UNFUNDED MANDATE AND THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING PROCESS IDENTIFIED LEGISLATIVE MANDATES BOOK THE LACK OF FUNDING TO MATCH WITH THE MANDATE. A REASON WHY WE GET A GAP SALUTE THE NEXUS IN MY VIEW IS FINDING A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE NEXT BUDGET PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE. SENATE BILL EIGHTY CREATES A NEW ENDEAVOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO AVARIETY OF THINGS IMPROVE OUR SAMPLING OF CRAB. IT A CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR. HE ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO CREATE AN OF THIS ARRAY SHOULD PROGRAM WHICH MEANS THAT CRABBERS CAN POTENTIALLY- CLEAN THE CRAP IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THE POTENTIAL RISK AROUND TOXINS IN THE- NUTS OF THE CRAB. YET STILL SAIL CELL FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION BUT BEATING THE CRAP. SO THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THE REQUEST IS FOR LIMITED FUNDING. OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND AND THREE POSITIONS PERMANENTLY TO CREATE THE ADMINISTRATION SAMPLING AND OTHER CRAP PROGRAM ELEMENTS. MANY OF THAT THAT'S WHY GENERAL FUND AND WHY NOT FEE COMMERCIAL FISHING. WE TRIED TO FEED COMMERCIAL FISHING AT A RATE THAT RECEIVED A LOT OF RESISTANCE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ULTIMATELY ADOPTED US ALL THE INCREASE. BUT THERE ARE PUBLIC BENEFITS IN THIS SPACE AS WELL. YEAH DESTABILISE PORTS ACROSS OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ON THE COAST CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREASING THE RICH TO OUR VALUABLE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES WERE FACING JOB LOSSES AND REGIONAL DEPRESSION. AND IF WE DON'T AKE THE KIND OF STEPS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL IT'S POSSIBLE WE'LL SEE A REDUCTION OF GOOD CLEAN SEAFOOD ON THE PLATES FOR CALIFORNIANS TO ENJOY SO THERE'S A LOT OF BROAD PUBLIC BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. THAT'S THE SECOND PROPOSAL THE NEXUS IS AVOIDED UNFUNDED MONDAY MANDATE BY ENSURING THE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. THIRD PROPOSAL- WHALES AND TURTLES. SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE REALIZE NOW WE HAVE A CONFLUENCE OF. A STANDING EVENTS HAPPENING IN THE OCEAN. SO WARMING CLIMATE WARMING OCEAN CONDITIONS IS AFFECTING LARGE MARINE MAMMALS MIGRATION PATHS ALONG OUR COAST HAS THAT MIGRATION PATH IS ALTERING THESE MAMMALS ARE COMING MORE REGULARLY IN CONTACT WITH. CRAB FISHING GEAR THAT'S PLACED IN THE OCEAN OUR CRAB FISHERY IS ONE OF OUR MOST REMAINING LUCRATIVE FISHERIES FOR OUR HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE OCEAN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TREATS IS NOT ICONIC EVENT ON THE CALENDAR TO EAT DUNGENESS CRAB. OUR STATE WILL BE THE FIRST STATE WE'RE WELL ON THE WAY. TO GET A FEDERAL PERMIT UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO GIVE REGULATORY STABILITY. TO OUR HARDWORKING COMMERCIAL FISHING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE OCEAN WHILE ALSO BEING THE FIRST STATE TO CREATE A REAL TIME SCIENCE DRIVEN PROGRAM. TO REDUCE ENTANGLEMENTS OF WHALES AND SEA TURTLES IN OUR FISHERY GEAR IN THE OCEAN IT'S CUTTING EDGE NO ONE ELSE IS DOING THIS. THE PROPOSAL SIX FUNDING- TO IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM- AND THEN LASTLY THE FOURTH ITEM. IS A MODERNIZATION. OF OUR RESEARCH FULLY. IN HERE WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY VESSELS THAT ARE NON LAW ENFORCEMENT VESSELS THAT WE USE AS THE BACKBONE FOR OUR SCIENTIFIC MONITORING AROUND THE STATE. IN WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN SACRAMENTO DELTA ESTUARY ENVIRONMENT WE TOOK A LOOK AT OUR AGING VESSEL FLEET WE LOOKED AT TWELVE VESSELS AND OF THOSE TWELVE WE CONCLUDED FIVE OF THEM ARE AT MOST RISK OF JUST THEY'RE TAKING TOO MUCH MAINTENANCE TIME. THEY'RE OUTDATED AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETIRE THEM SO THESE VESSELS SUPPORT THE MONITORING- OF- LEGALLY PROTECTED AND RECREATIONAL USE FISH. THEY RELATE TO ABOUT FIFTY THREE SURVEYS WE DO- EACH YEAR ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MONITORING TRIPS WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THIS PART OF OUR SCIENTIFIC VESSEL FLEET. SO THE WHALE PROPOSAL IS NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS OUR GREATEST GAP IS ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPECIES CONSERVATION. BROUGHT BENEFIT TO SAVING WHALES IN THE OCEAN AND ENSURING A SUSTAINABLE DUNGEON THIS CRAP FISHERY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NEXUS TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING YOU CAN MAKE A ONE TIME CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND GAINED GREAT EFFICIENCIES AND CONVERTING YOUR GAP- MEMBER SMITH I CAN'T SEE WHETHER CHAIR BLOOMS COME BACK BUT THAT'S MY STORY ON ISSUE SIX AND I'M BACK. IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'M BACK- AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION- THAT'S ABOUT SPECIES CONSERVATION BUT FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON- REALLY EMBRACING SERVICE BASED BUDGETING- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THAT- AND I THINK IT- WE'RE SEEING FROM YOUR REPORTS. THAT IT'S REALLY PAYING OFF AND THE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL SO MY QUESTION ABOUT SPECIES CONSERVATION HAS TO DO WITH BLACK BEARS SOME. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE IN THE STATE. HAS THERE BEEN A STATEWIDE COUNTLESS SO WHEN WAS THAT- HOW DO YOU PERFORMANCE STATEWIDE COUNT AND HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF HUNTING PERMITS FOR THE SPECIES. WE DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS USING BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AND DECADES OF LEADERSHIP AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT. SO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE. AND LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE GET TO THAT ESTIMATE CHAIR SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SCIENTISTS- ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT WE MIGHT HAVE AS MANY STATE SCIENTIST AS ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT AND STATE SERVICE PERHAPS MORE. THESE ARE TRAINED BIOLOGIST- COMING OUT OF UNIVERSITIES AND YOU KNOW WORK EXPERIENCE ELSEWHERE. AND THEY DO THIS ACROSS ALL THE ANIMALS AND PLANTS WE MANAGE SO IT'S NOT LIMITED THE BEARS. SAGE GROUSE HALIBUT- YOUR WHALES SHARKS SO ON SO FORTH. THIS IS A COMPLEX SPACE FOR THE SCIENTIST THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DETERMINE A POPULATION. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE BIOLOGIST IS CALCULATING ECOSYSTEM ERRAIN TO SPECIES YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTIMATE. WHETHER COST AND THE ASSESSMENTS TYPICALLY USE SOME CORE DATA STREAMS ONE IS HARVEST WHICH IS A EUPHEMISM FOR WHAT KIND OF LEGAL TECH THE USE OF AN ANIMAL OR A PLANT. ABUNDANCE SO YOU'RE LOOKING ACROSS THE POPULATIONS RANGING DISTRIBUTION ANY DATA STREAMS. AND TYPICALLY STANDARD PRACTICE ALL THAT FEEDS INTO UP SOME MATHEMATICAL MODEL. IN THE MODEL THEN PRODUCES ESTIMATES THAT ALLOWS THE MANAGERS TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHIN OUT WE'RE SEEING THAT POPULATION STABILITY INSTABILITY. ERTZ FEATURES PLANTS WE DON'T DO A CENSUS IT'S NOT ANALOGOUS TO SAY THE CENSUS BUREAU TRYING TO COUNT EVERY CITIZEN THAT IS NOT STANDARD PRACTICE FOR ANY STATE OR FEDERAL WILDLIFE AGENCY. SO WE DON'T LITERALLY SEEK TO TELL EACH INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL ON A POPULATION- THERE ARE SOME PLACES- HERE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE SIERRA SAGE GROUSE WE'RE WE'RE ABLE TO DO AERIAL SURVEILLANCE. AND THE SPECIES LIFE'S STRATEGY THE TEND TO CONGREGATE IN OPEN SPACES AND YOU CAN COUNT FROM THE AIR THAT BECOMES A DATA STREAM FOR A MODEL. BUT WITH THE BEARS. WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT TRUE CENSUS ON EVERY SINGLE PAYER THEY MOVE PLACE TO PLACE. THEY HIDE THEY HIBERNATE TO CAMOUFLAGE SO IT'S NOT LITERALLY THE CASE WE COUNT. AT THE STATE WIDE POPULATION FOR BEARS AND I WOULD SUBMIT IF THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO HEAD. ROUTE WE MAY FIND OUT- THE RESOURCES TO LITERALLY DO THAT ARE PRETTY ASTRONOMICAL LIKE ADDICTS LOST AND STAFF LABOR PERSON OUR LEVEL. SO HERE'S HOW WE DO IT WITH BEARS. WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND WE CALCULATE IT FROM WHAT HUNTERS REPORT EACH SEASON. THE HUNTER OF THE BEARS REQUIRED TO BRING TO BEAR BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE TAKE A PREMOLAR TOOTH OUT OF THE BEAR AND YOU CAN DO A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC WORK BUT IT'S CREDIBLE AND PRECISE FROM THAT. LOCUSTS DESCEND ON EACH AND SEX AT THAT MOMENT OF THAT PARTICULAR BEAR. AND THEN WE AGGREGATE THAT INFORMATION FROM THE TOOTH ANALYSIS. WE TAKE THE AGGREGATION AND WE PLUG IT INTO A MODEL AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO PRODUCE AN ANNUAL BEAR POPULATION DYNAMICS. NOW MORE RECENTLY WE'VE BEGUN TO AUGMENT THAT WITH LOCALIZED VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF GPS DRIVEN WORK ON REGIONAL BEAR POPULATIONS WERE CLOSE TO COMPLETING. AN ASSESSMENT ON THE EAST SIDE AND MODOC COUNTY THERE WILL BE JUST LOOKING AT THE BEARS AND MONO USING KIND OF GPS DATA. WE'RE TAKING THOSE STREAMS AND WE'RE PUTTING THEM INTO OUR STANDARD MODEL APPROACH AND WE COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE. WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY CREDIBLE. IN WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW USING THAT EFFORT IS WE ESTIMATE- BLACK BEAR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT ESTIMATE IS REALLY TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT ESTIMATE OF FORTY THOUSAND. IT'S WITHIN A PRETTY STABLE POPULATION TREND SO THE OVERALL POPULATION BASED ON OUR WORK IS NOT GOING DOWN. OUR STATE IS GOING UP BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY STABLE. SO WHEN YOU GET TO AN ASSESSMENT AT THE BIOLOGIST LEVEL OF STABILITY. THAT'S REALLY WHEN YOU GET INTO- CHAIR HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S A SUSTAINABLE POTENTIAL USE OF THE ANIMAL. SO UNLIKE SOME OTHER DYNAMICS YOU FIVE DIGIT AND BOBCATS AND ELSEWHERE. PEOPLE ACTIVELY CLIENT BEAR FOR USE THERE'S CONSUMPTION AT A LOT OF THE BEAR PRODUCT IS USED. SO RIGHT NOW ALL THE WAY THE DEPARTMENT MAN JUST BEAR HUNTING IS COURSE YOU CAN'T USE DOGS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT ARE COMMISSION WORK THROUGH THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WE CAP. THE AMOUNT OF BEARS THAT CAN BE TAKEN EACH YEAR THROUGH HUNTING. BACK CAP AS IT IS AT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED. THAT NUMBER OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED. REFLECTS PRETTY STANDARD SCIENTIFIC THINKING WITHIN WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POPULATION. THE SCIENTISTS WILL TELL YOU 10% OF THE POPULATION IS A STANDARD THAT IS CONSIDERED AMONG WILDLIFE MANAGERS WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE KIND OF NUMBER FOR YOUR HUNTING IMPACT. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT CURRENT CAP OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED RELATIVE TO THAT 10% FIGURE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED IS ABOUT FOUR POINT 25% OF THAT STABLE POPULATION. SO WHAT WELL BELOW WHAT ARE WILDLIFE SCIENTIST INDICATE IS KIND OF A SUSTAINABILITY HARVEST LEVEL WITHIN THE HUNTING CONTEXT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL AND THEN I'LL PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS ACTUALLY THAT WE'RE NOT NEAR THAT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED LEVEL THE CAP IF YOU WILL. AND I'VE GOT IT IN MY NOTES HERE SOMEWHERE UP HERE IS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THAT DATA NOW. THE NUMBER OF BEARS HARVESTED WAS ACTUALLY. ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX SO WE'RE EVEN BELOW THE CAP. WHICH MEANS IF YOU'RE THINKING OF THAT 10% SUSTAINABILITY NUMBER. WILL PROBABLY MORE AROUND THE 3% NUMBER RELATIVE TO THAT KIND OF. BEST SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENT OF YOUR HARVEST TARGET YOU'RE ALWAYS KEEPING AN EYE ON THE- WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS STATE WIDE DYNAMIC WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HARVEST DATA. AND WE'RE USING. FIND IT IN MERRITT WITH THESE REGIONAL AS GPS EFFORTS THAT SOME WORK WE SHOULD DO THAT SOME WORK I'M INSTRUCTING OUR STAFF TO ACCELERATE. LAST COMMENT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC PROCESS RIGHT NOW. SO I WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT RECENTLY CREATED A PROCESS THAT OUR STATE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WORK ANYONE CAN SUBMIT A PETITION. TO THE COMMISSION ON AN ON AN ITEM WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION WE'RE IN RECEIPT OF A PETITION THAT'S ASKING A LOT OF THESE BEAR HUNTING QUESTIONS. THE COMMISSION'S REFERRED IT TO OUR DEPARTMENT OUR DEPARTMENT WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMISSION IN APRIL IN PUBLIC SESSION WITH THE PUBLIC KIND OF DEBATE THE PETITION IT'S PRESENTED AND I WANT TO ALSO. RESERVE THAT SPACE SO THAT PROCESS CAN KIND OF PLAY OUT FAIRLY FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE IN. THAT'S A LOT- CHAIR LET ME PAUSE THERE. THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL EDUCATION THANK YOU- JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR MY EDIFICATION- THAT TEN PERCENT. TO A FIGURE THAT'S ACROSS SPECIES OR THAT'S SPECIFIC TO BEAR. YEAH I THINK THAT THERE'S A- THE SPECIES INDIVIDUALISTIC NATURE AND THAT'S THE NUMBER I AYE MINOR THINGS WERE USING IMPAIR WHETHER IT'S UP OR DOWN FOR DIFFERENT. I THINK IS TRUE AND RELATES TO WHAT OUR OUR- UNIONS AROUND ANY GIVEN POPULATIONS ABUNDANCE. LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH SAGE GROUSE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS A FEDERALLY PROTECTED SPECIES BUT YOU CAN STILL HUNT SAGE GROUSE IN THE EASTERN SIERRA. AND THERE ARE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT HUNTING HARVEST LEVELS ANYWHERE NEAR THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF THE SPECIES IS MUCH LOWER SO YOU DO HAVE TO TAILOR YOUR MANAGEMENT DECISION WITH THOSE FACTORS AS WELL. THANK YOU MR BACK. UP THANK YOU AB. JUMPING JACK BACK IN HERE FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE HEARING SO IF THIS SOMEHOW HAS BEEN COVERED AT- I HAVEN'T I'M INTERESTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- WE'RE FINDING WITH GENERAL FUNDS AND THERE WAS- SOME TALK ABOUT WHILE AGO ABOUT INCREASING FEES. HOW TO HELP WITH A FUNDING- THE HAD A BIG FEE INCREASE AND THERE'S LOTS OF OPPOSITION TO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT THE TOPIC THAT I BROUGHT UP- IN THE PAST WHICH IS. TO HAVE A FEE AND THE HAVE- AT LEAST START TO HAVE A SMALLER INCREASE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TIE THAT SMALLER INCREASE TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IN SOME WAY SO THAT IT'S TOTALLY GOES UP TO TRY TO DECREASE THE CHANCES THAT WE HAVE- THE DEFICIT SO I'M JUST. CURIOUS IS THERE- IS THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERING- LOWER- FEE INCREASE- RATHER THAN THE LARGE ONE THAT- MET WITH SO MUCH OPPOSITION AND IF THE- DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING A LOWER FEE INCREASE WOULD IT ALSO BE MATCHED WITH A- A WRITER FOR SOME KIND OF- CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION- ADDED TO IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY ANSWERS KIND OF YES BUT AND HERE'S HERE'S THE BUT PART. OF THE HOWEVER PARK- I PEOPLE APPROPRIATE SO. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF FEES ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT WE CAN GET THERE SO YOU MAY BE ASKING ABOUT ONE. AND I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO FEES ON COMMERCIAL FISHING BUT WE HAVE HUNDREDS THE WAY WE DO OIL SPILL RESPONSE IS WE HAVE FEES ON THE PRODUCTION OF BARRELS OF OIL AT THE FACILITY. REPHRASE THAT RECENTLY WE HAD FEES ON PEOPLE WHO NEED PERMITS FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WE RAISE THAT RECENTLY. YEAH FEES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HUNT AND FISH HAVE. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATIVE WORK BEEN GIVEN ABILITY FOR US TO YOU KNOW KIND OF MINISTERIAL TO DO- ANNUAL COPYRIGHT IF YOU WILL CALL. IF YOU'RE ASKING JUST ABOUT COMMERCIAL FISHING- YES WE TRIED TO RAISE FEES SOME WILL SAY WE- SOUGHT TO RAISE THEM TO EXPONENTIALLY HIGH. THE OUTCOME BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH WAS A MODEST FEE INCREASE BUT I GOT TO BE FRANK. A LOT OF OUR USER COMMUNITIES CANNOT FATHOM. THE COST OF WHAT THE FEE WOULD BE TO TRULY ALIGN OUR MISSION AND OUR CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL SO MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT APARTMENT CAN'T FEED ITS WAY OUT OF A LOT OF THE PREDICAMENT WE'RE IN AND THE BEST EXAMPLE IS. OUR WORK IN SPECIES CONSERVATION PARTICULARLY ENDANGERED SPECIES IS TO THE GENERAL BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. I MEAN WHAT WOULD BE A FEE. CHARGE SOMEONE WHO SUBMITS A PETITION TO PROTECT AN ANIMAL UNDER THE STATE ESA OF THREE. MAGIC IT'S HARD TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT WOULD BE A VARIETY OF FEET SOURCES TO TRULY GET OUT OF THIS DYNAMIC IT IT I'VE I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY PUBLIC BENEFITS- TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES IN. ALL OF THOSE SHOULD NOT BE. GOOD FUNDED BY BY FEES I'M PROBABLY FAR MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE WE CONTINUALLY HAVE MODEST FEE INCREASES. A. N. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ADOPT WHAT I THINK IS BEST PRACTICE WHICH IS TO HAVE THOSE FEE INCREASES HAVE AN AUTOMATIC CONSUMER PRICE. INFLATION ADDED TO IT I THINK IT'S A IT IS YES THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL BATTLE TO THAT BUT THAT OF POLITICAL BATTLE IS ONE. WELL WORTH HAVING IF YOU IF YOU WIN IT ONCE- YOU YOU ADDRESS A- LONG TERM PROBLEM- CHAPTER SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU. AND ALL I'LL JUST SAY- I THINK- IT'S CLEAR THAT INCREASING GOT WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH ATTEMPTING TO AND INCREASED FEES AND WE KNOW- THAT- YOUR SENSE THAT WE'VE KIND OF REACHED A LIMIT OF HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH MANY OF THESE FEES IS. PROBABLY TRUE AND I ALSO AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT THAT- HAVING A COLA WOULD BE HELPFUL ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT WOULD SOLVE. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE- THEY PUT THEIR- WE WE'VE GONE SO LONG WITHOUT IT- ADDRESSING ANY ADJUSTMENTS AT ALL IN MANY. CASES- BUT I I'M pWE GET TO A PLACE WHERE- WE BRING IN THE NECESSARY FUNDING- WITHOUT RESORTING TO SOME KIND OF FEE INCREASE SO WE'RE SORT OF IN A CIRCULAR ZONE HERE WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO- AND- WE KEEP PUTTING IT OFF. AND THINGS KEEP GETTING WORSE SO- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ANSWER TO THAT IT'S REALLY MORE OF AN OBSERVATION A FRUSTRATION- IT. COULD I JUST RESPONDED THAT REAL QUICKLY THERE IS TO IT THE IDEA OF JUST GOING YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT ADJUSTING A FEAT THAT'S THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS THERE'S A DEFICIT YOU KNOW WE'VE BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT WE'RE WE'RE BEHIND. BUT AT LEAST LET'S QUIT DIGGING THE HOLE DEEPER BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE DON'T HAVE A COLA- WE JUST MAKE WE JUST GET THE FEE FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND WHERE IT SHOULD BE AYE AYE AYE SO I WE DON'T NEED TO GET ENGAGED IN A GONNA CALL CLEAR BUT I CERTAINLY. DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT- OF MY POINT WAS SIMPLY THE WHOLE IS ALREADY SO DEEP THAT EVEN WHEN WE MOVED TO AS I THINK WE SHOULD- REGULAR INCREASES BASED ON. A SOME KIND OF COLA- WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLOSE THE- THE EXPECT THE GAP AND TO DECREASE THE DELTA SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH BUT ENOUGH SAID ABOUT THAT- I IN THE COLLECTED THE- TO CALL ON ALEJO AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON. A ISSUE. SIX THE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RACHEL IN WITH L. A. OCCUPY VERY BRING I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND JUST WITH ECHO- THAT REQUEST THAT THAT THAT SERVICE BASED BUDGET DATA BE INTEGRATED INTO FUTURE BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT GREAT TO HEAR THAT COMMITMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR THAT. AB REALLY WILL HELP YOUR DECISIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PROPOSALS MIGHT HELP CLOSE OR WIDEN GAPS. ALSO JUST REITERATE THAT PART OF THE REASON THE LEGISLATURE PURSUED THIS S. B. B. EXERCISE WAS TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE FEET VERSUS GENERAL FUND ALIGNMENT ISSUES SO. THAT DATA WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT- IN ANY FUTURE DECISION. WHILE I THINK THE DIRECTOR MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT THE GAPS ARE LARGE ENOUGH THAT. THAT FEES WOULDN'T BE FEASIBLE NOR APPROPRIATE IN MANY CASES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES. TO HELP CLOSE THIS GAP. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHEN YOU'RE ADDING NEW IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU'RE ADDING NEW EXPLICIT ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE EXPLICIT BENEFICIARIES BUT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT. WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THAT- JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL FEE PROPOSAL SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BROAD BASE THAT HAD A LOT OF RESISTANCE. SHOULDN'T PRECLUDE YOU FROM CONSIDERING INDIVIDUAL FEE INCREASES- WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR EXPLICIT ACTIVITIES. AT WITH REGARD TO LIVE FOR PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU IN THIS AGENDA ITEM WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS IN PART BECAUSE OF AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC BENEFIT. ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL OF THEM THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ALSO HAVE A FEE PAYING BENEFICIARIES BUT- JUST ONE ECHO THAT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CONTINUOUS CONVERSATION I HAVE EVERY YEAR FOR THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE MULTIPLE CONSTITUENCIES MULTIPLE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. AND MULTIPLE FUND SOURCES- SO ASKING THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN CONTINUES TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S BEST ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WITH SPECIFIC SPECIFIC. BENEFICIARIES THANKS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MERRIAM KAPLAN WITH THAT OF THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS WOULD JUST REITERATE- THE COMMENTS OF DIRECTOR BOND- AND THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE AT A PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE BASED BUDGET GAPS. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO HELP YOU ANSWER ANY QUESTION GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR BOTTOM I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ON- OFF ON ON THIS ITEM- ARE YOU SPOKE A ABOUT THE- REPLACEMENT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF- OF VESSELS IN- IN THE DEPARTMENT'S FLEET- AND I FORGET WHAT THE NUMBER WAS- THAT YOU HAD IDENTIFIED. BUT YOU IDENTIFIED THOSE IS- NEEDING REPLACEMENT LIKE NOW BECAUSE THEY **** OUTLIVE THEIR- THAT THEY'RE COSTING MORE THAN- THAT IS REASONABLE. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK FORWARD THREE OR FIVE YEARS HOW MANY MORE VESSELS WOULD FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY YOU HAVE A NUMBER FOR THAT. SO AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER THIRTY. VESSELS IN KIND OF THIS RESEARCH SPACE THAT ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE VESSELS WE EXPECTED TO BE RETIRED BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH TWELVE. AND THE AGES OF THOSE ARE BETWEEN LIKE THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT YEARS. AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TWELVE WERE PURCHASED BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. AND YOU GET ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF LIFE OUT OF THE VESSEL. AND SO WE WENT FROM IN THE THIRTIES TO TWELVE AND WHERE YOU GET FIVE IT IS WE PRIORITIZE WITHIN THE TWELFTH- THOSE WHICH ARE KIND OF AT. THE END OF THEIR USED AND USEFUL LIFE THE SOONEST. SO YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWELVE AND FIVE IS THE NEXT TRANCHE FOR SURE. IF YOU COULD GET THE- A- A DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THE ADDITIONAL SEVEN BESTIVAL OF. VESSELS I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. HOUSTON THANK YOU. AND NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN NOW L. I'M SORRY- MISTRUST IN FELLOW FOR DIRECTOR BOTTOM. IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I DO BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND YOU'RE ASKING US TO PAY FOR THE SAME PROGRAM THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW. WELL WHAT ABOUT THE LAST YEAR FUNDING. NO I WOULD NEVER ASK FOR THAT- CYLINDERS THAT SO LET ME PROVIDE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT IDENTIFYING THAT CONFUSING ASPECT. SO LAST YEAR. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY. COMPLETING YOUR APPROPRIATION AUTHORIZATION TO US OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHAT WE DID WITH THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. IS WE WENT AHEAD AND CREATED A MORE MOBILE PHONE APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING TO USE A PAPER BOOK TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU'RE FISHING ON THE MCLEOD. CAN YOU KEEP A FISH BETWEEN THE BRIDGE IN THE TREE WE WE'VE GONE AND CREATED A MOBILE PHONE APPLICATION. FOR AREAS WITHOUT CELL SERVICE THAT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR BIGGER CHALLENGES. AND WE ALSO WENT AHEAD AND PUT ALL OF OUR FISHING REGULATIONS INTO A GPS. APPLICATION THAT CAN BE YOU READILY ACCESS FROM YOUR PHONE. THAT'S WHAT WE USE THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOUR BUT BECAUSE BOTH OF THOSE WILL BE READY. FOR NOW IF YOU APPROVE OF THE 800-100-0800 TEN THOUSAND. WE WILL TAKE THAT AND USE THAT MONEY FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE HAVE A LITTLE AUTOMATED LICENSE STRUCTURE WHERE ANYONE CAN BUY A LICENSE ELECTRONICALLY RENEGOTIATED A CONTRACT WITH THE PROVIDER OF IT AND NOW TO DO THE THREE SIXTY FIVE LICENSE AND THE DISCOUNTS FOR SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WE NEED TO GO BACK INTO THAT COMPUTER SYSTEM AND PUT IN ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY FOR THESE TWO NEW THINGS. SO THAT HUNDRED TEN IS FOR NEW WORK THE SEVEN FIFTY DO GREAT THINGS AND THEN THEY JOINED. ABOUT ONE YEAR FROM NOW IS A COMPLETE KIND OF PACKAGE FOR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE A BIG CONCERN WITH THE SERVICE BASED. BUDGETING THAT IS NOT BE IN THAT USE FOR EACH DEPARTMENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED AND IF IT'S FISHING LICENSE BEAR HUNTING. WHATEVER THE DEEP SEA FISHING KIND OF CASE. DO YOU HAVE A MATRIX THAT THEIR ENERGY DEPARTMENT LOAN FUNDS TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF MONEY THAT YOU MIGHT. USE IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT AND NOT GOTTEN BACK FROM THAT FUND. AGAIN KIND OF SO WE. WE'RE NOT IN THE PRACTICE OF LEARNING OUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. WHAT WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT AS ILLEGAL IN FINANCE MIGHT WANT TO MENTION WE MAY HAVE MORE SPECIFIC DEDICATED ACCOUNTS THAN ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT TRUST PROBLEM WITH ARE YOU ARE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE DOLLAR FOR PIGS END UP BEING USED ON TURKEY'S. WHAT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING ALSO INVOLVED WAS AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR TEN MAJOR ACCOUNTS WITH ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO WE CAN INCREASE OUR TRANSPARENCY ON HOW MONIES COMING IN AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND WHAT IT'S BEING USED FOR AND THAT'S NOW PART OF OUR ANNUAL PROCESS WITH OUR COMMUNITIES UNDER SPD. AND IF YOU'D LIKE A FOLLOW UP WE WOULD ENJOY THE CHANCE TO COME BY YOUR OFFICE AND KINDA UNPACKED THAT ASPECT OF OUR WORK OKAY YET PRESENT I WANT TO ASK FOR AN AUDIT BUT I WANT TO SEE IT WHEN MAYBE THE LAST TIME YOUR DEPARTMENTS WERE AUDITED BUT I'LL KEEP AN EYE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU THANK. ALL RIGHT DIRECTOR LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE SEVEN OUR LAST ITEM OF THE DAY ON CANNABIS. LICENSURE SAFETY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. OKAY SO AGAIN CHECK BOND DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT THE SMALL LIFE. AND HERE'S HOW IT WOULD START ON CANNABIS. THERE'S A LOT OF- UNDER WAY IN UNDER DISCUSSION AROUND CANNABIS. MANY OF THOSE THINGS DON'T RELATE TO OUR DEPARTMENT. AND I WHEN I READ THE NEWSPAPER ITS SEEMS POSSIBLE THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS WILL BE THINKING THROUGH LIKE THE NEXT VERSIONS OF YOU KNOW OUR CANNABIS APPROACHING CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A LOT HAPPENING. BUT BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FROM OUR DEPARTMENT IS MUCH MUCH MUCH NARROWER THAN ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS. LAST YEAR- BECAME LAW AB ONE FORTY ONE. FOR THREE YEARS UNDER THIS LAW THERE'S A WAY WE'RE GOING TO. BRING MORE CULTIVATORS INTO A LICENSE SPACE USING PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND SOME STREAMLINING COMPONENTS AROUND SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S PERMITTING. THERE'S A DEFINED WINDOW THREE YEARS THERE'S A WORKLOAD WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THIS PROPOSAL IS TO COVER THE CLARKS OUR TIME AND EFFORT FOR FILLING THAT KIND OF OBLIGATION FOR THREE YEARS. WE SEEK AN AMOUNT OF THE ALLOCATION OF ONE FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUND TO COVER THIS REGULATORY WORK OVER THE THREE YEARS. AND SEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO FIND ABOUT THREE YEARS I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT'S YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DOING HOW DO YOU WORK WITH COUNTIES WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU RECEIVE UNDER ALLOCATION THREE AT THE TAX HOW'S THAT BEAT BEING USED FOR GRANTING. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WELCOME ANY CHANCE TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE BUT THIS BCP. IS ABOUT A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY SEVEN POSITIONS THREE YEARS. AB ONE FORTY ONE AND PROVISIONAL LICENSE. REPLIES THERE AND SEE WHICH WAY THE COMMITTEE OR YOU CHAIR MIGHT LIKE TO GO WITH CONVERSATION OR QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR YOU AND- I'M THE ONLY ONE OF NOT MORE. CAMPUS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON THAT NOT. OUR I'VE I'VE WE CAN JUST HEAR FROM L. A. O. AND TO. A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- WRAP THIS ONE UP. NO COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU MISTER CHECK YOUR FUTURE REPORTS ON THIS- DIRECTOR BONHAM. I'M SORRY THERE'S AND THERE'S- NO COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU FOR HAVE YOU HAD SO MUCH STATIC AND I KEPT YOU WAITING CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR THAT- WELL THAT CONCLUDES OUR- ISSUES TO BE HEARD. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS- ON OUR NON DISCUSSION- AGENDA ITEMS AND ALL I JUST KICK THAT OFF- SECRETARY ROSS I THINK. A OF A YOU'VE- BEEN ABLE TO HAVE- THE GREAT PLEASURE OF- HANGING AROUND AND LISTENING TO THE REST OF- ARE- AGENDA ITEMS HERE AND I APPRECIATE IT- YOU'RE WAITING PATIENTLY- BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT ISSUE SIX ON THE NON DISCUSSION AGENDA. A GIVEN THAT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET APPROPRIATED A MILLION DOLLARS. FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF- OF- THE- A BILLING QUESTION AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO OF MY LEGISLATION THE B. C. P. ON THIS ITEM- ALLUDES TO THE FUNDS NOT BEING UTILIZED UNTIL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- AND- SO I WONDERING IF YOU CAN GIVE ME- AN UPDATE ON THE- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THIS BILL AND- EXPLAIN WHY- THE- THE FUNDS WILL BE UTILIZED. TO FOR A LITTLE WHILE MISTER CHAIR- I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR WORKING ON THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ABOUT A TWO YEAR PROCESS TO GET- THE FINAL VERSION THAT IS NOW THE LOCK- AND I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING WE ARE VERY COMMITTED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING THIS. AND IT IS OUR GOAL AND OUR COMMITMENT TO HAVE OPERATIONAL PROGRAM BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE CHALLENGE FOR US HAS BEEN- MULTI FOLD. ONE AS WE RECEIVE THE BUDGET WITHOUT POSITION AUTHORITY AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF STAFF WITH THE RIGHT BACKGROUND ON THIS TO BE ABLE TO FULLY- DEVELOP THE STANDARDS FOR THE COMMUNITY BY BANKS FOR ANIMALS- AND TO THE REGULATORY PACKAGE. AND SO WHAT% WITH THIS- WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE WILL BE ABLE TO START AND RECRUITMENT PROCESS. WE DID TRY TO RECRUIT WHAT ARE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO GET US STARTED- OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AND THAT TIGHT LABOR MARKET AND ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WITH THE KIND OF TECHNICAL. SCIENTIFIC CREDENTIALS VETERINARY BACKGROUND BACK THAT WE NEED IT'S A VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKET AND LIMITED TERM POSITION. OR ARE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE WHAT THOSE KINDS OF CREDENTIALS SO WE WILL START OUR RECRUITMENT PROCESS KNOWING THAT THIS IS IN THE BUDGET. WE WILL ADVERTISE THEM AS LIMITED TERM WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO GO TO PERMANENT AND HOPE THAT THAT WILL HELP WITH THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. BUT I DO WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT- WAIT WE ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU ON THE FAILED TO GET AT RIGHT WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO GETTING IT IMPLEMENTED. AND ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO. MAKE OUR PUBLICATION SHAT IN THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO GREAT THANK YOU I HOPE SO TOO. THERE'S A LOT OF DOGS OUT THERE THAT ARE- ANXIOUS. TO START GIVEN BLOOD. MISTER SMITH I THINK YOU ARE YOU HAVE A I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- CERTAIN. ROSS OR SOMEONE. SKEWS ME FOR YOU. IT'S A AS AS A SAYS A BIT OF GOT CALLING- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY ITEM IS IT IS NUMBER TEN. THIS Y. LAS COULD MITIGATION CREDITS BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THESE MEASURES LIKE SB SEVEN NINETY. WHICH CREATED INCENTIVES AND VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES TO CONSERVE AND PROTECT OUR WILDLIFE. HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT SOME OF THESE EFFORTS AND TOOLS LIKE AB TWO ZERO EIGHT SEVEN FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ARE BEING USED TO PREVENT HOUSING PROJECT FROM BEING BUILT. I HAVE A COUPLE PROJECTS IT CONCERNED AB TWENTY EIGHTY SEVEN AUTHORIZES THE APPROVAL OF REGIONAL CONSERVATION INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. TO PROVIDE VOLUNTARY NON BINDING GUIDANCE. YET THE ANTELOPE VALLEY REGIONAL CONSERVATION INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS CURRENTLY BEING USED AS AN EXHIBIT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT TO PREVENT TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES BEING BUILT. INCLUDING THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE DRAFT ADDED STRATEGY WAS WRITTEN BY TWO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THOSE SAME TROOPS SAME TWO GROUPS ARE SUING THE WHOLE RANCH. AND I'D LIKE TO GET OF THE DIRECTOR OFFICIAL WILDLIFE AND APPROPRIATE STAFF TO SIT DOWN WITH ME ON A MEETING TO IN THE DISCUSSES ISSUES MORE IN DEPTH. BECAUSE WE NEED HOSING IN CALIFORNIA WE GET A PROJECT THIS CAN BE BUILT BEEN APPROVED AND NOW IT'S BEEN SUED AND MORE LITIGATION SO THAT'S ALL I ASK FOR FROM OF DIRECTOR BONTA PROBABLY. I GLADLY COMMITTED THAT FOLLOW UP I'VE DONE THE SAME WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG. AND I. WILL JUST INFORM YOU. OUR DEPARTMENT.

MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH INJURY AS WE HEAR ON BEHALF OF THE HOME RANCH CORPORATION- WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH- AND WE ACTUALLY- WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTOR'S RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO. SET UP A SETTING UP A MEETING- THE ITEM THAT'S BEFORE THE COMMITTEE HERE IN ISSUE NUMBER TEN SHOULD BE A ROUTINE ITEM TO APPROVE FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF- THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD POINT TO KIND OF LOOK AT HOW THE PROGRAM'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED BEFORE MORE STAFF. THE INVESTMENT FOR MORE STAFF IS BEING MADE- THERE IS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM WHERE YOU BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. AND YOU HAVE TO THERE HAS TO BE TRUST AND HAS TO BE TRANSPARENCY. AND THERE ALSO HAS TO BE OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE DATA THIS USED. AND THE RANCHES EXPERIENCE IN ADULT VALUES NOT THAT. AND SO ARE THESE ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE EAGER TO DISCUSS WITH THE DIRECTOR. THANKS TO THE COMMITMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE TODAY DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. AND WE ALSO NEED THIS TO BE TRANSPARENT BECAUSE- IDEALLY MORE COMPANIES MORE INTERESTED PARTIES WILL COME A FORT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS BUT THERE HAS TO BE TRUST. AND THERE HAS TO BE TRANSPARENCY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO AREN'T SOME OF THESE ISSUES OUT. AND WHEN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE DOES GET TO THE POINT OF MAKING A DECISION TO ACTUALLY APPROVE THE STAFF POSITIONS IT'LL BE FOR PROCESS A PROGRAM.
