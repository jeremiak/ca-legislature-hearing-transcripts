PETITION COMMITTEE SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES -- TEXTING WHILE DRIVING. DISTRACTED DRIVING CAN BE AS DEADLY AS IMPAIR DRIVING. FOR DRIVING WHILE THE AFTER DRINKING. THEREFORE I HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW EVERYONE WHO DRIVES ROADS OF OUR STATE WILL BE SAFER. THIS BILL STRENGTHENS THE PENALTY FOR DISTRACTED DRIVING BY ADDING A POINT VIOLATION ON A PERSON'S DRIVING RECORD. FOR THE SECOND OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONVICTION. RESEARCH SUGGESTS TO DRIVERS WHO TEXT MESSAGE WHILE DRIVING ARE EIGHT TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT. AS DRIVERS WHO ARE NOT TEXTING. UNFORTUNATELY OUR EXISTING DISTRACTED DRIVING LAWS HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO DETER THIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE. DMV RECORDS SHOW THAT. THREE YEARS AGO THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND OFFENSES. FOR TEXTING WHILE DRIVING. TWO YEARS AGO THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND OFFENSES SO THAT REPRESENTED A 20% INCREASE THOSE OF THE MOST RECENT DMV NUMBERS. BUT THE OFFENSE IS GREW BY 20% IN JUST ONE YEAR. THE CURRENT PENALTIES A BASE FINE OF TWENTY DOLLARS FOR FIRST VIOLATION AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS HAVE HAD LITTLE IF ANY IMPACT. AS THOSE -- THE NUMBERS SHOW. BY ELEVATING IT DISTRACTED DRIVING CITATION TO THE SAME STATUS AS OTHER DANGEROUS DRIVING VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SPEEDING A RUNNING A RED LIGHT. THIS MEASURE SHOULD HELP MAKE THE ROADS SAFER. THE COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED AMENDMENT TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS TO ACCOMMODATE OUR DMV AND OTHER PROCEDURAL MATTERS I READILY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT AND THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THOSE. FOR THAT AMENDMENT WITH ME TODAY IS MIKE KNUDSEN ON BEHALF OF THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY. STATING I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THEY'RE OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FORTINO SIX WHICH REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. TO ALLOCATE 10% OF FUNDS IN THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL VEHICLE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. TO ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE FUEL. IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES. THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWO THOUSANDS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S FUEL. AND VEHICLE TYPES. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE PROGRAM HAS SUCCESSFULLY HELPED ATTAIN STATE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS BY INVESTING IN A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF TRANSPORTATION AND FUEL PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS. DESPITE THE SUCCESS. THERE BEEN RECENT EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM B ALLOCATING ALL PROGRAM FRONTS. TO ONE SINGLE PREFERRED TECHNOLOGY. WELL SOME TECHNOLOGIES REDUCE EMISSIONS MORE THAN OTHERS. NO ONE TECHNOLOGY IS BEST FOR ALL POTENTIAL USES AT THIS TIME. FOR EXAMPLE MANY HAVE YOU ROOM DUTY VEHICLES DO NOT HAVE VIABLE -- VIABLE -- ME. A VIABLE ZERO EMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR FLEETS BUT DO HAVE NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE OPTIONS AVAILABLE. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY OWN DISTRICT I COME FROM LONG BEACH I REPRESENT -- BOTH PORTS WE HAVE A LOT OF HEAVY VEHICLE USED -- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TRAVELING IN AND OUT OF THE BOARDS AND SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME -- BECAUSE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS REALLY GET AWAY FROM THESE ARE HEAVY POLLUTING VEHICLES ON THE EVER HERE TODAY IS TO DO THAT. SO WITH ME HERE TODAY IS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS THOMAS LAWSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BELLA COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S TOM SLAWSON ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA AFTER GAS WE WILL COALITION. WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSSES BILL AND FOR TO BE HEARD AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ALL THE WORK THEY'VE DONE ON THIS BILL TO GET US TO THIS POINT. AB FORTINO SIX SEEKS TO GET CLEANER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW TO GIVE CALIFORNIA'S ALL OVERSEE CLEANER AIR TODAY. PROVIDING IMMEDIATE AIR QUALITY PRODUCTION SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES THE 10% ALLOCATION THIS BILL IS EQUIVALENT TO THE STORE GO ALLOCATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN -- ALLOCATED TO THIS PARTICULAR CATEGORY. IT DOESN'T SEEK TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM OR TAKE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY -- THE CALIFORNIA TO GUESS VEHICLES FOR MYSELF I SIT ON THE BUYERS ARE COMMITTEE AND WE'VE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TRYING TO GET SOME MOVEMENT ON THE WAIT LIST THAT HAS GONE FROM ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOLKS THAT -- HAVE ACCESS PROGRAM AND WHAT I MEAN BY FOLKS I'M TALKING ALL FLEETS ALL OVER THE STATE THAT I WANTED TO PURCHASE NEW TRUCKS. HEAVY DUTY TRUCK EMISSIONS MAKE UP MAJORITY OF OUR MISSIONS -- ISSUES. SO AS THESE FLEETS ARE UNDER GREATER PRESSURE TO GET CLEANER NOW NOT NECESSARILY LATER ON IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FORTY BUT THEY'RE UNDER PRESSURE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE ACCESS IN OUR CENTER PROGRAMS TO GET HELP FOR DOING JUST THAT. SO FOR FLEET WANTS TO PURCHASE THE CLEAN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TODAY. WITH INSTEAD OF DOLLARS THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. NATURAL GAS VEHICLES WHICH ARE CERTIFIED TO THE LOW IS OPTIONAL MISSION STANDARD AND POWERED BY RENEWABLE FUEL. ARE THE CLEANEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TODAY AND HAVE A TWO TRUCKS SECTOR. FLEAS FROM CALIFORNIA HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY WANT THESE VEHICLES. AND WE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS TODAY AND AB FORTINO SIX IS THAT ORANGE JUICE THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE APPRECIATE NIVEAU. SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE. FOR A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BELT MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RYAN CANYON BEHALF OF CLEAN ENERGY. THE NATION'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION FUEL IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON -- BRANDING OR SEE ON BEHALF OF C. R. NONVIOLENT A SERVICES AND SUPPORT [inaudible] OKAY -- WE HAVE OPPONENTS COMPORT PLEASE. HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I'M JULIE MALINOWSKI FALL ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LECTER TRANSPORTATION COALITION CAL ET SEE IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION THE STATE -- UTILITIES -- ELECTRIC CAR PROVIDERS INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS AND TRUCK AND BUS MANUFACTURERS -- KELLY T. C. IS REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE OPPOSED TO NATURAL GAS VEHICLES IN FACT WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE DIVERSITY THAT THE AIR F. E. B. T. PROGRAM PROVIDES -- OUR OUR OPPOSITION IS REALLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE IS ALREADY A VERY ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS -- THAT GOES ON TO DEVELOP THE SPENDING PLAN FOR THIS PROGRAM ANNUALLY -- CAL E. T. C. ALONG WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL BENEFIT FROM THE ADDED THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PARTICIPATING ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO AFTER THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOPS IN COMMENTS FILED A REPLY COMMENTS FILED. THE STAFF DEVELOP THE DRAFT SPENDING PLAN IN THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THEN GETS THE TO TO ADVISE ON THAT SPENDING PLAN AND THEN THE STAFF GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND BASED ON THE SPENDING PLAN THAT DEVICE YOU PORTS COMMENTS. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY IS PROVIDING A LOT OF DIVERSITY -- IN ITS SPENDING -- AND SO IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS WE THINK THIS BILL SHOULD PROBABLY THAN TRY TO FIX THAT PROCESS NOT TO A SET ASIDE -- FOR THE SPENDING WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE SUPPORT THE AUTHOR AND WE SUPPORT THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL IN THEIR EFFORTS TO AVOID THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND PROVIDE FUEL DIVERSITY WE JUST DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE WAY TO DO IT. THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS PLEASE. MY NAME IS KATHERINE GARCIA AND I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE FOR SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS OPPOSED TO AB FORTINO SIX WHICH WOULD CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO ALTERNATIVE FUEL WHICH CAN INCLUDE POLLUTING BIO FUELS. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TOWARDS A ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION FUTURE. THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY TO THEM WHEN YOU A FUEL PROGRAM. WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WAS PASSED TO HELP CALIFORNIA REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. BY DESIGNATING THIS YEAR MARK CALIFORNIA WILL LIMIT THE FUNDING AWARDED TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. BIO FUELS GENERALLY ARE NOT EMISSIONS FREE AND THEIR USE IN COMBUSTION ENGINES CONTRIBUTE. TO CLIMATE AND LOCALIZED AIR POLLUTION. A COMMITMENT TO BIO FUELS AND ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES WOULD HINDER CALIFORNIA. EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR GOALS. THE STATE SHOULD NOT INVEST IN STOP GAP MEASURES TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES PLEASE VOTE NO ON FORTINO SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF OTHERS SPEAKERS OPPOSING PLEASE. I DON'T SEE ANY AND IT'S A GREAT PERHAPS YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. MISTER CHAIR THING OUT AND WE DID CAN YOU MAYBE -- EXPLAINED THE AMENDMENT WE AGREE. TO THE COMPROMISE YOU AGREE TO THE AMOUNT YES. AND THE I'D LISTEN THIS EFFORT IS ABOUT CLEANER NOW. MIGHT WE HAVE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE THAT ARE ZERO MISSION IN TWENTY YEARS YES. AND CERTAINLY I WELCOME THAT I NEED THAT IN MY DISTRICT BUT WE NEED CLEAN AIR TODAY WE DON'T NEED CLEAN AIR TWENTY YEARS WE NEED CLEANER TODAY AND THE THE EFFORT OF THIS BILL. IS TO GET US CLEAN AIR CLEANER AIR SOONER -- THEN THEN THEN WAITING FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR SOME POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGY TO POSSIBLY. BE DEVELOPED AND ALL WE'RE ASKING IS AGAIN IS FOR THAT 410%. TO BE ALLOCATED TO TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL USES. OKAY THE AMENDMENT TO BE CLEAR. SUNSETS THIS PROVISION YES ON JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO [inaudible] ESSENTIALLY -- WE'RE LEARNING -- A WINDOW. YEAH BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ENTIRE STATUTE. ON THIS WILL SUNSET THE SAME TIME SO THEY'LL BE A REALLY. VIEW OF THAT STATUTE AS A WHOLE AT THAT TIME IN AND THE SIDE OF THE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO NEXT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS AT THAT TIME. RIGHT THANK YOU THAT IS CORRECT MISTER THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE INTENTION OF THE SUNSET SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS -- AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR -- WHERE I? THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT HAS TO HAS THE TWO PORTS CERTAINLY WERE UNDER CARB RULES. PRESSURE FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES RESOURCE SUPPORT WINNER PRESSURE FROM THE LOCAL AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT BUT EVEN ON OUR OWN -- WE'VE TAKEN A VERY LOCAL APPROACH TO THIS FOR THE CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN THREE POINT NO AND THE EFFORT OF THIS BILLS TO HELP US MEET THOSE GOALS AND AND IN A IN A RAPID FASHION. THE SOONER DODD DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION [inaudible] CLOSER DOLLY. SENATOR DOLLY AS A PUSH I JUST WANT TO SAY I APOLOGY THIS IS AWESOME -- AS SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND TRYING TO MEET THE STANDARDS AND THIS IS THE THIS IS A WE'RE GOING TO IT'S GONNA TAKE US YEARS TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS. IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS -- HE WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR US OUT OF THE PORTS AND AND IT JUST IN TRANSPORTATION GENERAL -- THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH IT ACTUALLY CAN CONVERT A LOT EASIER -- TO THE VEHICLES TO NATURAL GAS OR THOSE TYPES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIO FUELS. VERSUS GOING -- TWO ZERO EMISSION SO -- HOLY SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND THERE'S A GREAT COMMONSENSE APPROACH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU SENATOR. DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING STATEMENTS AT THIS TIME I'D ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MISTER A WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS PLEASE.

SIX VOTES IN FAVOUR EMILY'S ARE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU SO MOMENT -- WE'LL GO TO AB FIFTY ONE FIFTY ONE SIX IN CHIU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. DAVID SIR AND WE'LL WELCOME HIM TO OUR COMMITTEE -- YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB FIVE SIXTEEN A BILL THAT WOULD REFORM A FEW TELLING PRACTICES THAT HAVE SEVERELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. LET ME FIRST START WITH A BIG THANKS TO YOUR CHAIRMAN AND YOUR STAFF MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR WORK ON THE VERY SIGNIFICAN AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO TAKE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE IN YOUR STAFF'S ENGAGEMENT. FOR THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WATER BILL SEEKS TO DO. WHAT OUR BILL DOES NOT DO BECAUSE THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE BILL AND TO SUMMARIZE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING? FIRST WHAT ABOUT US. EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS A STATEWIDE STUDY THAT CLEARLY DOCUMENTED THE IMPACT OF THREE TOWING GROUNDS WHICH I WILL FOR TO HIS POVERTY TOES. IF YOU CAN'T PAY FOR FIVE PARKING TICKETS IF YOU CAN'T PAY FOR AN OUTDATED CAR REGISTRATION OR FOR A PRIVATE PARKING SPOT. YOUR CAR CAN BE TOWED. SINCE ALMOST HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE A SPARE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. FAR LESS THAN THE AVERAGE COST TO GET YOUR CAR OUT OF A TOW YARD. GETTING TOWED EQUALS ASSET FORFEITURE YOU LOSE YOUR CAR YOU LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO GET YOUR JOB YOU LOSE YOUR JOB. AND MANY INSTANCES YOU LOSE YOUR ONLY ECONOMIC ASSET AND YOUR ONLY FORM OF SHELTER. THESE PROPERTY TOES OF XCELERATED POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. IT ALSO TURNS OUT THE TOTAL YARDS LOSE MONEY WITH THESE PROVISIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STOW THEY HAVE TO STORE CARS BEFORE A LIEN AUCTION ALE. AND THE AVERAGE STORAGE AND LEANS SO COST FAR EXCEED THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THESE TOWED CARS FOR SIMILAR REASONS CITIES RUNNING THESE TOàN PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN LOSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS WHY WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THESE PROVISIONS TO END THE CYCLE OF POVERTY THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR FAMILIES FOR TOW YARDS OR CITIES. KNOWING JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL. THERE BEEN SOME ADVOCATES FOR CITIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL AND STALLING. THAT IS FALSE THERE ARE OVER THIRTY GROUNDS TO TOW CARS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. MOST HAVE TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IN TRAFFIC FLOW WERE NOT TOUCHING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE. SECONDLY THERE SOME CITIES THAT HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW ABANDONED CARS ON THE STREET WITH THIS BILL. THAT IS ALSO FALSE THERE IS A SPECIFIC TOWING PROVISION THAT ALLOWS CITIES TO TOW CARS THAT ARE BANNED IN WRECKED INOPERATIVE EXCEPT TRUCK. WERE NOT TOUCHING THOSE PROVISIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ALSO HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL. THAT'S A DOUBLE ALSE BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER TOLL PROVISION THAT WE'RE NOT TOUCHING WITH THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS ANY CITY TO PASS ANY LOCAL LAW TO REQUIRE TOWING IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS BILL SUPPORTS PURE LOCAL CONTROL. LET ME CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING THE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK. OUR REGIONAL BILL VOTED ON BY THE ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE DELETED THE THREE POVERTY TOWING PROVISIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AFTER NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND MANY OF YOU WITH AMENDED OR BILL FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER TO ONLY DELETE ONE OF THE THREE TELLING GROUNDS. THE AMENDED VERSION OF OUR BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE TO TELL FOR EXPIRED REGISTRATION. THE MINUTE VERSION OF A BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE TO TOW CARS THAT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY PARKED ON PUBLIC STREETS. CURRENT LAW SAYS A CAR TO BE TOWED AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS WITHOUT NOTICE SINCE MANY CITIES TOLD US THAT THEY DON'T TELL UNDER THIS LAW FOR AT LEAST A WEEK OR LONGER. AND SUPPORT PROVIDING NOTICE TO CAR OWNERS BEFORE TELL. ARMAMENTS WOULD ALLOW A CAR TO BE TOWED AFTER NOTICE AND TEN BUSINESS DAYS AND I WANT TO JUST MAKE A NOTE. I'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH AT LEAST ONE OF YOU ABOUT THE TEN DAY BUSINESS NOTICE AND I AM PREPARED IF THIS IS THE WILL OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO AMEND IT FURTHER TO GO FROM TEN BUSINESS DAYS TO HAVE A FIVE BUSINESS DAY REQUIREMENT. OUR BILL DOES MOVE TO AND TOES FOR ONE PROVISION AND THAT IS FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS WHICH IS THE PUREST VERSION OF TELLING SOMEONE TO COLLECT A MINOR DEBT. I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT LEGAL NOT TO PAY PARKING TICKETS IN FACT OUR BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD USE ALL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES TO COLLECT UNPAID DEBTS THERE AT LEAST. EIGHT IN STATUTE CHARGING LATE PENALTY PAYMENTS WITHHOLDING TAX RETURNS PLACING REGISTRATION HOLDS SETTING DEBTS TO COLLECTION AGENCIES OBTAINING CIVIL JUDGMENTS LOVING BANK ACCOUNTS GARNISHING WAGES REPLACING MEANS. BLESSING I WANT TO SAY IS. THERE ARE STRONG CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS THE TONE SOMEONE TO CLICK TO MINOR DEBT VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION AGAINST THE SEIZURE PROPERTY THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES. THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION AGAINST THE DEPRIVATION OF DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION. YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WITH ME IN SUPPORT I'M NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. WITNESSES IN FAVOR PLEASE GO AHEAD LIMóN NAME IS GENET TOO LOUDLY IN. WHAT PUT THEM MIGRATED FROM EARLIER -- MOUTH THERE. THERE YOU GO. CLICK THE BUTTON. THIS ON GOING OKAY MY NAME IS GENET DILLONLIAM. AND I'M A I'M CURRENTLY A SENIOR CITIZEN RESIDENT THAT LIVES IN THE SUCH AS HOUSING. IN OAKLAND COMMUNITY COME IN OAKLAND. MY CALL WAS -- TO ON MAY TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BY AUTO PLUS TOWING. FOR A MOVE. FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS I'M SORRY A MILLINER WAS NOW. GO RIGHT -- PROBLEM AND I CAN I CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE TICKETS. THE TOWING COMPANY DEMANDED MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM MY CAR TO BE RETURNED. COULD AFFORD THESE FINES AND FEES. ALLOWS MY VEHICLE I HAVE HEARD OF THE SIMS STORIES. ABOUT YOUR FROM A NEIGHBOR'S. THERE IS A STREET SWEEPING THE SUITES STREET SWEEPER SIX DAYS A WEEK. WHICH MEANS WE ALL TOP WALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET WHICH LEAVES YOU KNOW NOT ENOUGH PARKING FOR EVERYBODY -- WHEN I LOST MY CAR? ALLOWS MY ONLY AT SAID ALLOWS MOBILITY TO GO AND BUY AFFORDABLE FOOD -- AT THE GROCERY STORE AND I HAVE CHRONIC PAIN FROM A WORK RELATED. ENTERING. WITHOUT MY CAR I LOSE MY ABILITY TO TEN MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND FINALLY ALLOWS MY VEHICLE THAT ALLOWED ME TO PURSUE. EDUCATION DEGREE AT MERRITT COLLEGE -- AB. FIVE SIXTEEN WOULD CHANGE THE LAW. SO THE WORKING PEOPLE AND SENIORS ARE NOT. CONTINUOUSLY TRAPPED IN. THERE IS SYSTEMS. THE STRIP THEM OF THEIR OPPORTUNITY AND WELL WE CANNOT AFFORD THE HIGH. TOWING FEES. THAT STATE. IS TRYING TO IMPOSE UPON US. IN THAT VENUE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE SIXTEEN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- MANY OF YOU'VE SEEN US AND COMMITTEES BEFORE ANOTHER OF OUR LEGAL SERVICE ADVOCATES OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AROUND THE HIGH COST OF FINES AND FEES AND THE IMPACTON OUR LOW ON LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THESE THESE IMPACTS THESE FINES AND FEES BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP FOR OUR CLIENTS AS YOU JUST HEARD DESCRIBED -- SHE'S ONE OF JUST LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS WHO HAVE EITHER HAD THEIR LICENSE TAKEN IN TRAFFIC COURT OR BEEN SUBJECT TO HAVING THE CAR TAKEN AWAY FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS. AND IT MAKES OUR CLIENTS HAVE TO CHOOSE DALY BETWEEN PAIN RANT PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE OR PAYING THE COST OF THESE TICKETS -- THE REPORTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO REFERENCE TOWED INTO DEBT HIGHLIGHTS YET ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH THESE PAUL THESE POLICIES ARE HARMING THE POOR BY THE HIGH COST OF THESE TICKETS. ARE LITERALLY -- CAUSING US TO SEE CARS THAT ARE BEING -- TOWED FOR FIVE MORE PARKING TICKETS -- FOR A DMV REGISTRATION IT'S OUT OF DATE OR ARE FOR BEING PART FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY TWO HOURS ON THE STREET. THESE ARE THE THREE MOST SIGNIFICANT REASONS THAT WE SAW IN OUR RESEARCH THAT SHOWED THAT WHEN A PERSON -- GOT THEIR CAR TOWED THEY DID NOT GET IT BACK WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THESE THREE ITEMS AT RANDOM BUT INSTEAD VERY MUCH IN SPECIFIC BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE TRULY IMPACTING. OUR CLIENTS -- SO AS WE SIT HERE TODAY IT'S IT'S A LITTLE IT'S YOU KNOW OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO ARE SIGNIFICANT -- AND FRANKLY A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL FOR US BECAUSE THEY DO LIMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE BILL AND IT MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT IN THIS BILL THIS YEAR. WE'LL GET THAT PROTECTION -- BUT NONETHELESS EVEN WITH THOSE -- WE STILL THINK THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL STEP FORWARD FOR SOME OF OUR CLIENTS THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO KEEP THEIR CARS AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN OUR CLIENTS HAVE THEIR CARS FOR MANY OF THEM. IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO WORK AND ACTUALLY PAY OFF FEES FINES AND FEES AND ONE CARS GET TAKEN FROM OUR CLIENTS LIKE THIS IT pGOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT REVENUES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE STILL STAND SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND CHEN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WE HAVE A OF THE NEXT PICKERS JUSTIFICATION WHO -- WHO THEY ARE AN ORGANIZATION THEY REPRESENT FAVOR OF IT?

ASSEMBLYMAN COULD YOU ASSEMBLYMAN CAN YOU CLARIFY. THE CHANGES YOU'RE AGREEING TO TODAY. WELL CERTAINLY SO. THE CHANGES THAT OF AN IMPRINT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS. ONE WE ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE TO DELETE THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH EXPIRED REGISTRATION SO THE REALLY THREE GROUNDS -- THAT WE WERE TRYING TO IMPACT WITH THE VERSION THAT CAME FROM THE ASSEMBLY SO ONE OF THE GROUNDS. WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE MOVING ON SO WILL BE DELETING THOSE PROVISIONS. WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE RULES AROUND CARS ADMIN LEGALLY PARKED ON PUBLIC STREETS CURRENT LAW SAYS A CAR HAS TO BE TOWED AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS WITHOUT NOTICE. AND AGAIN BECAUSE A LOT OF CITIES TOLD US THAT THEY TYPICALLY DON'T TALK -- TO UNDER THIS OFFER AT LEAST A WEEK OR LONGER AND SUPPORT PROVIDING NOTICED THE MEMBERS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD ALLOW A CAR TO BE TOWED AFTER. NOTICE AND TEN BUSINESS DAYS I HAVE CIRCULATED TO THE MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE IT WAS REQUESTED BY AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS THAT WE CONSIDER TAKING TEN BUSINESS DAYS AND HAVING THAT GO DOWN TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THAT. IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THAT OUR BILL DOES NOT -- WE ARE NOT AMENDING -- THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAD IN THE ORIGINAL ASSEMBLY BILL AROUND TOES FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS OKAY. OKAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GO OVER THAT SO EVERYBODY'S KIND OF UNDERSTANDS. OKAY -- LET'S HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. WELCOME. THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- RIGHT WE DO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- OVER GRATEFUL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS LEFT THE DOOR OPEN FOR ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH FOR AB -- FIVE ONE SIX THE LEAGUE MUST REGRETFULLY REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB FIVE ONE SIX AS AMENDED -- I THINK WE WOULD CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS IN WITH THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS -- AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE DSCUSSIONS DIRECTLY WITH THE AUTHOR -- MORE CLOSELY -- AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME TIME FOR THAT -- IF IF THE YOU KNOW IF IF -- IF THAT'S THE WILL THE CHAIR -- AND THE COMMITTEE -- AB FIVE WAS ONE SIX AND IN OUR VIEW WILL HURT THE ABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENTS TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR LOCAL STREETS -- AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY -- CITIES HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TOOLS TO MANAGE AND BALANCE THE PARKING NEEDS FOR EVERYONE -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR RESIDENTS BUSINESSES VISITORS -- AND COMMUTERS. I THOUGHT TO BE CLEAR A CITIES ALLOW FOR FOLKS TO PARK ON PUBLIC STREETS BUT WE LET ME SHORT OR LONG TERM STORAGE. A PRIVATE VHICLES ON PUBLIC STREETS -- THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR RESIDENTS TO GET HOME -- BUSINESS IS THAT OUR BUSINESS IS TO HAVE A STEADY FLOW OF CUSTOMERS -- OUR VISITORS TO HAVE -- TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES AND VISIT THEIR FAMILIES -- AND TO ENJOY OUR CITIES AND TO PREVENT BLIGHT AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARDS -- ENFORCEMENT -- IN A TIMELY SEVENTY TWO HOUR MATTER -- IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT -- INNER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- TO ADDRESS BLIGHT AND THE RISK -- TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THIS BILL CREATES -- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR NOVO -- ON AB FIVE ONE SIX TODAY THANK YOU. TO TURN MEMBERS MATTHEW HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON OUR BUSINESSES WE WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SHOPPING CENTERS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER. GROUPS THAT MANAGE PROPERTIES FOR RETAIL AND FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND MANY OF OUR CONGESTED AREAS AND CITIES. LARGE CITIES AND SMALL CITIES ALIKE IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T ABLE TO MANAGE ITS PARKING IN A MANNER IT WILL HAVE A HUGE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THOSE COMPANIES THAT RELY ON A LOT OF TURN AROUND OF CARS BEING ABLE TO COME IN PARK. GET THEIR BUSINESS DONE AND MOVE OUT OF THERE THERE'S A LOT OF A MINUTE SOME FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY THAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO ONE FORTUNATELY I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE. WHO WERE SPEAKING -- TO THE BILL AS IT CAME INTO THE COMMITTEE WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE IN CONCERN WITH THE DISINCENTIVE ISING. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE GETTING PARKING TICKETS IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR CAR -- TOWED BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING PARKING TICKETS WHAT'S TO STOP YOU FROM PARKING ANYWHERE YOU WANT GETTING A TICKET AND JUST MOVING ON WITH YOUR DAY THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG ISSUE WE HAVE -- THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT A DECADE AGO DID PASSED SOME -- TOWING REFORM WHICH HAD DIRECT IMPACT ON US AND WE SEE THOSE NEGATIVE IMPACTS EVERY DAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW YOU CAN PARK AND PRIVATE PARKING LOTS RIGHT NOW FOR UP TO ONE HOUR -- AND WE REGULARLY SEE EVEN WITHOUT BEING TOWED WE REGULARLY SEE EVEN IN THOSE PARKING LOTS WORD SIGN VERY CLEARLY NOT TO PARK THERE PEOPLE WILL COME IN AND AND PARK THE VEHICLE THEN LEAVE IT THERE FOR ONE HOUR -- KNOWING THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT HERE ON A MUCH BROADER SCALE ON ALL THE PUBLIC STREETS. FOR THOSE REASONS WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL. OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SIR ONE MORE SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOE COLLINS I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A LICENSE REPOSSESSIONS WERE OPPOSE THIS BILL HEY. WE HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THINGS WORK IN A TOW YARD BECAUSE IT'S OUR INDUSTRY THAT'S HIRED. TO GET A CAR OUT OF THE TOW YARD ON BEHALF OF THE REGISTERED OWNER OR LEGAL OWNER. OFTENTIMES THE PAYMENT THAT IS DUE IS PUT ON THE BACK END. OF THAT PERSON'S CAR NOTES THEY CAN MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS AND STILL KEEP THEIR CAR. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE DON'T HEAR ANYTHING ADDRESSING HOW FEES ARE CHARGED A TOW YARD AND I'LL EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THEY GO TO A TOW YARD WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THERE'S NO PRICING MATRIX. THERE IS A BOARD THAT SAYS YOU PAY X. Y. Z. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR PAY OUT RECEIPT IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. THE CONSUMERS USUALLY WILL PAY AS A REPOSSESSION AGENCY I SEE OUR PARK ARE PAID OUT RECEIPTS AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY CHALLENGING THE FEES. WHETHER IT'S THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS HERE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THERE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS SOMEWHERE ELSE. IN FACT OFTENTIMES TOWARDS WILL CHARGE YOU AN HOURLY RATE NO TACK ON THREE HOURS AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE ONE WHICH IS IN THE CONTRACT. BUT NOBODY'S ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF HOW THE FEES ARE CHARGING HOW A CONSUMER THE LEAST SOPHISTICATED CONSUMER WOULD ACTUALLY KNOW IF YOU'RE PAYING LEGAL A LOT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY. NOW WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS INCLUDING ONE THAT SAYS YOU CAN USE A DEBIT CARD BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS HE HAD A CAR TOWED HE CAN'T USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A CREDIT CARD. AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE DEBIT CARDS BUT THE CODE ONLY ADDRESSES THAT YOU CAN USE. A CREDIT CARD SO THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO SHOWS UP WITH THEIR DEBIT CARD IS TURNED AWAY. NOW WE'VE OFFERED AN AMENDMENT SO YOU'D BE ALLOWED TO USE A DEBIT CARD. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING BACK YET -- COST RECOVERY FEES THE CITY'S CHARGE OF TWENTY TWO A FIFTY POINT FIVE THEY CAN RECRUIT COVER THE COST. FOR THE TOWING AND STORAGE OF THE VEHICLE HIT SOME CITIES WILL CHARGE FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THEIR COST. THIS IS WHAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE CAR BACK IT'S EVERYBODY'S TKING A BITE OUT OF THEM BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO THE TOW YARD THEY HAVE NO MONEY LEFT. WE'VE OFFERED NUMEROUS SOLUTIONS AND WERE OPEN. TO HAVE MORE DIALOGUE BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU AND CLEAR -- THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE NAME AND NOW ORGANIZATION PLEASE ONLY. I GRAY CASE HERE ABOUT HALF OF THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION ABOUT.

SECURE MEMBERS ANDREW AND WE WOULD CHARGE -- ANTS WE HEAR ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS WITH RICH RECENTLY ADOPTED OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS MEASURE. OKAY WELL -- IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS WE HAVE A BILL ON AUG SEPT YOUR AMENDMENTS FOR DISCUSSION AND WILL TURN IT OVER. TO QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO HAS SOME QUESTIONS. FOR I JUST US FOR SENATOR BUT WE GET CONFUSED ALL THE TIME. THAT'S MY CIVIL RIGHTS -- IT'S OKAY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH I WE JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU KNOW AS I I WAS -- LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER AND I SERVED ALSO THIRTEEN YEARS SO. I HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS GOING INTO THIS DISCUSSION AND I'M REALLY THANKFUL TO THE AUTHOR THAT HE SAT DOWN WITH ME AND TRY TO ADDRESS ON MY CONCERNS AND THAT OF MY COMMUNITIES AND MY POLICE OFFICERS WHITE. VALUE THEIR OPINION AND AND AND AGAIN BEING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE FEAR OF LOSING THE LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST -- THREE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY THE BIGGEST CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT AS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER I HAVE PUT SOME ORDINANCE IN PLACE AS IT. TO TO TOWING AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES CAN STILL KEEP THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCE AND THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE. SO I WANT TO POINT OUT TO ONE SECTION THAT STILL IN THE BILL JUST TO CLARIFY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN MY COMMUNITIES. I AND THAT IS SECTION TWO TWO SIX FIVE ONE OF THE VEHICLE CODE THAT STATE THAT ALL CITIES CAN STILL TOTAL A CAR IF IT'S PARKED ARE LEFT STANDING WERE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. BY RESOLUTION ORDINANCE HAVE PROHIBITED PARKING AND HAVE AUTHORIZED THE REMOVAL OF THE VEHICLE SO. MY ORDINANCE THAT I PUT IN PLACE FOR TWENTY CAN YOU CLARIFY IS THAT STONE PLEASE ANSWER IS YES AND FIRST OF ALL LET ME APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH US ON THIS AND THERE'S NOTHING THIS BILL THAT WOULD IMPACT THE LOCAL RUBIO ORDINANCES THAT YOU HAVE PUT INTO PLACE AROUND. SENATOR RUBIO. SENATOR RICK WELL THESE ARE AND YOU WERE ON THE CITY COUNCIL I MAN THAT'S WHY REFER TO THEM THAT WAY -- THE VEHICLE CODE SECTION THAT YOU REFERENCED ALLOWS ANY CITY TO PASS ANY LOCAL RESOLUTION ORDINANCE AROUND TELLING AND LET ME. STATE SOMETHING BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS BEEN ON CLEAR WITH A LOT OF CITIES IN THEIR UNDERSTAND IN THIS BILL. THIS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS NOT FOR A STATE TO TOWING POLICY THAT WOULD PREEMPT LOCAL LOS WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT WE DELETE. CERTAIN TOWING PROVISIONS SO THAT -- THEY'RE OFF THE BOOKS BUT BUT THIS OTHER PROVISION THAT WE JUST REFER TO WOULD ALLOW ANY CITY TO PASS ANY LOCAL TOWING ORDINANCE TO DEAL WITH ANY LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCE. YOU SEE FIT SELECT IN EXAMPLE -- THE ONLY TOàN PROVISION THAT AT THIS POINT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN WOULD ALLOW TO WHICH WE'RE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT. IS THE IDEA THAT IF YOU HAVE FIVE MORE PARKING TICKETS TOàN SHOULD NOT BE THE OPTION THAT CITIES USED TO GO OUT TO THEIR MANY OTHER. WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO AFTER PEOPLE AND I LISTED EIGHT OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE AS A CITY TO GO AFTER YOU. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS AS A STATE POLICY IT SHOULD NOT BE AN AUTOMATIC RULE BUT IF YOU'RE LOCAL CITY OF ANY OF YOUR LOCAL CITIES BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE. YOU COULD PASS A LOCAL LAW THAT SAYS IN THE CITY OF TAX. IF YOU HAVE FIVE OR MORE PARKING TICKETS YOUR CAR CAN BE TOWED. SO THIS IS A PURE LOCAL CONTROL MEASURE -- SO THE THE LONG WINDED ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT YES THE RULES THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. THANK YOU SO THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN AGAIN COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY CITIES ALL MY ENFORCEMENT WHO AGAIN. I VALUE VERY DEEPLY. WOULD FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT OUR LOCAL ORDINANCE WAS STILL BE IN PLACE AND THEY COULD STILL DO THEIR JOB -- NOW AS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER I ALSO STRUGGLED VERY MUCH ON MAKING SURE THAT MY COMMITTEE WAS SAFE CLEAN AESTHETICALLY PLEASING BUT ALSO. BALANCING THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE NOW DAYS THAT ARE FALLING ON HARD TIMES AND SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET THE CARS OUT. WE DEALT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR CARS DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO TO TAKE THEIR CARS OUTSELL SO TAUGHT ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT AND SO. I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ONCE AGAIN SITTING DOWN WITH ME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT WAS A LONGER TERM. AND HE WAS WILLING TO BRING IT DOWN TO FIVE DAYS AND TYPICALLY IT I CAN TELL YOU AS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER IT WOULD TAKE US A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET THE CAR ANYWAY SO WE'RE JUST MAKING IT UP. PUTTING IN A PLACE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. TO DEAL WITH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE WHETHER IT IS GETTING SOMEONE TO HELP THEM IN A MOVE THEIR CAR OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE SO. I THINK THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT ME. CHANGE. AS IT STARTED IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH I WASN'T GONNA SUPPORT BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU SAT DOWN WITH US WHAT IS WITH ME. AND YOU'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY FROM THE BEGINNING THIS BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE CHANGES THANK AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO GIVE YOU CREDIT SENATOR -- WE SPOKE ABOUT THE TEN DAY. LIMITATION THAT WERE IN THE ORIGINAL MOMENTS ANDIT WAS THROUGH THE CONVERSATION YOU SAID YOU WERE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH FIVE DAYS AND AGAIN THAT WAS WHY WE HAVE CIRCULATED THAT A MOMENT HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. CORRECT THANK YOU SO AT IN TERMS OF THE BILL WERE VOTING ON WILL ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WELL AS YOUR OTHER AMENDMENTS. AS THE FIVE WORKING DAY. REQUIREMENTS BY BUSINESS EVER COURT OKAY SO THAT'S THE BILL ON THE FLOOR -- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS [inaudible] OKAY. WE ARE MOTIONS ARE YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION A LET ME SAY I KNOW -- THERE IS STILL SOME OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH MANY CITIES INCLUDING THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS. ARE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT -- AND LET ME ALSO SAY THAT I VERY MUCH AGREE WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY AND ASSURING TRAFFIC FLOW SO THERE'S NOTHING. ABOUT THIS THAT IS MEANT TO IMPACT THAT -- AS I THINK YOU HEARD FROM OUR COALITION WE HAVE AMENDED THE SIGNIFICANTLY -- I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD -- CONTINUE TO YEAR CONVERSATION WITHOUT MAKING AMENDMENTS BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON WHAT WE CAN AGREE WITH. AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND THAT'S WHAT WE ASK YOU TO DO. THE FINAL THING I WOULD SAY IS WE ALL NOW REGARDS OF WHICH SIDE OF THE AISLE WE ARE ON THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA'S FACING AT THIS TIME IS AROUND INCOME INEQUALITY. IT'S AROUND HOMELESSNESS IT'S RUN STRUGGLES INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR. AND AS WE HAVE. SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THIS WE DO THINK THAT THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT WILL HELP IMPACT THAT WITHOUT IMPACTING PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC FLOW AND FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] OKAY -- WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL [inaudible] THE MOTION -- OKAY -- WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. I WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT FIRST HOWEVER -- I WANT TO THANK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR THE WORK HE DID AND THE EFFORTS ON THIS BILL. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY HOWEVER I WANT TO NOTE. THAT SHOULD THIS BILL PASS OUT. OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER -- PROVIDING A SOFT LANDING FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED. NO AMENDED VERSION STARTS TO ADDRESS SEVERAL OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES OUR LOCAL AGENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE WITH THIS MEASURE. BUT MUCH MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. FINDING A LOCATION WHERE LOW INCOME IN HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO PARK. IS A KEY. WE CAN'T JUST KEEP ROUSTING THEM OUT OF PARKING PLACES WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM TO PARK. AND THAT INCLUDES A LOCATION WHERE PERSON WILL NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THEIR VEHICLE TOWED -- I I'M A I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF OF A ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. FOR AB -- THREE THREE ZERO WHICH IS A SAFE PLACE TO PARK BILL. CREATES -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIES TO CREATE THESE -- PARKING AREAS -- OF VARIOUS CITIES HAVE STARTED TO DO THIS KIND OF THING AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE THAT. HOWEVER WE SHOULD BE TAKING WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY TOOLS AWAY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TO ADDRESS -- ILLEGAL PARKING AND OR THEIR LOCAL ISSUES BUT MAY BE ASSISTING THEM ON THIS PROBLEM SO I THINK. THIS BILL IS A GOOD BILL THE WAY WE HAVE IN A MINUTE BUT I THINK THERE'S THESE OTHER ISSUES. THAT PROBABLY. IN PREPARATION. FOR THE BILL GOING FORWARD AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE'S BILL GOING FORWARD WHICH WE HEARD IN THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE OF LAST WEEK -- WE WANT TO HAVE THESE BILLS GO TOGETHER AS BABY POSSIBLY A JOINT SOLUTION. TO WORK TOGETHER ON SO IF YOU COULD -- WORK ON THAT IN THE FUTURE -- I WILL SUPPORT THAT SO OUT OF SUPPORT THE BILL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OF COURSE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH YOU SO WILL CALL THE ROLL PLEASE THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. CENTER ABOUT. WELL I BATES. DALI. DALI AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI AYE GALGIANI AYE [inaudible] MCGUIRE MORALE. ROTH RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER STONE. STONE NO I'M BURKE CASKEY. YOUR FIVE LOS OF A REALLY THE ROLE PERHAPS IN MEMBERS STILL BE THERE IN OTHER COMMITTEES AT THE TIME THANK YOU SIR -- OKAY -- OKAY WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN IS AB -- FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND IF IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU I'D LOVE TO PLAY A POOR MAN'S TALK GLORIA. INTRODUCED AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN FIRST YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR THAT BILL AND SUBSTITUTION OF OUR THE STEAM ASSEMLY MEMBER GLORIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN TODAY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. YOU KNOW HOW DIVERSE CAL WE KNOW HOW DIVERSE CALIFORNIA IS AND WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE UNIQUE IN VARYING NEEDS BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR COASTAL AND INLAND COMMUNITIES. FOR THOSE OF US THAT COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE KNOW THOSE DIFFERENCES EXIST EVEN WITHIN THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT WE REPRESENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION. AS LOCAL JR JURISDICTIONS PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PROGRESS IS OFTEN STYMIED WHEN THE NEEDS OF ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR CITY DIFFER FROM THE NEEDS OF ITS NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER SUB REGION REALIZES ANY BENEFIT AND THE SAME FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER BE TRANSIT A ROAD REPAIR GOES WITHOUT IMPROVEMENTS FOR DECADES. AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN SIX TO CHANGE THAT BY ALLOWING LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS BY SUBREGION. SUBREGIONS THAT HAVE SHOWN A DESIRE TO GET PAST THE POLITICAL GRIDLOCK IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SEVERAL TRANSPORTATION MEASURES APPEARED ON BALLOTS ACROSS THE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SIX PASSED IN EIGHT FAILED. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THREE PASSED INTO FAILED. HOWEVER IN THOSE THAT FAILED WE SAW EVIDENCE OF CORRIDORS OF CONSTITUENCIES THAT SUPPORTED THE MEASURE. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MEASURES IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN PLASTER COUNTY CAME WITHIN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF MEETING THE 66% PERCENT THRESHOLD. NEEDED FOR SALES TAX INCREASES DESPITE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF SUPPORT. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE VOTER APPROVAL APPROVAL THRESHOLD. UNDER THIS BILL IF A FUNDING MEASURE IS APPROVED BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER VOTERS. COMMUNITIES ARE BEING SHORT THAT THE DECISION TO TAX THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE IN VAIN AS THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE APPROVED SALES TAX WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. LOCAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MEASURES ALLOW LOCAL LEADERS TO HAVE GREATER CONTROL UNCERTAINTY OVER TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS. BY ENABLING. LOCALS TO GENERATE SELF HELP REVENUE THOSE IMPROVEMENT DOLLARS GO TO EVEN FURTHER WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO PULL STATE GRANTS WHICH MAY REQUIRE SELF SUSTAINING SOURCES OF FUNDING AS A CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY. WITH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE LABOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- AND TODAY I HAVE ROSE -- MAYOR JOHN ALLARD AND JOE FILL BORJA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

ALTHOUGH SB ONE PROVIDES CRITICAL INCREASES IN REVENUE MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE STILL FACE ONGOING FUNDING SHORTFALS TO MEET THEIR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. THE FINANCING CONCEPT OF THIS BILL COULD PAVE WAY FOR THESE AGENCIES TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RELIABLE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO ADDRESS OUR COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND PROVIDE FOR SAFETY CONGESTION. AND ADDRESSING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC. AND SAFETY GOALS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND TAKE YOUR TIME. OTHERS SPEAKERS PLEASE.

THEREFORE ROSA FAVOR THREE OPPOSE WILL EITHER OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS -- AND YOU MAY GO ON TO YOUR BILL. WHICH IS AB. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS THANK YOU MISTER YOU HAVE THE 4%. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTERS ON A START BY THINKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. IT'S TAKEN A DECADE TO BUILD OUT THE NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PUBLIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH A COMBINATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT STATE DOLLARS AND REPAIR FUNDS. TO REACH OUR STATES GOAL OF THE POINT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WILL NEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS. EXISTING CHARGING STATIONS PRIMARILY OFFER MOBILE PAYMENTS SUCH AS TAP CARDS AND MOBILE APPS TO INITIATE CHARGING SESSIONS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW REQUIRING EVEY CHARGING STATIONS TO ACCEPT PAYMENT VIA CREDIT CARD OR MOBILE TECHNOLOGY FOR BOTH. HOWEVER THE EVER RESOURCES BOARD IS PROPOSED REGULATION MANDATING THAT ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS BE OUTFITTED WITH PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS. WELL I APPRECIATE THE A RESOURCES BOARD'S INTENTIONS THIS REGULATION WOULD REQUIRE EXISTING CHARGING STATIONS TO UNDERGO COSTLY RETROFITS REPLACEMENTS TO COMPLY. REQUIRE CREDIT CARD READERS WOULD ALSO ADD SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OPEN UP EVEY DRIVERS TO SECURITY RISKS BY EMPLOYING LESS SECURE TECHNOLOGY. OUR LIMITED RESOURCES ARE BEST SPENT A POINT INFRASTRUCTURE EQUITABLY AND EFFICIENTLY TO ENSURE THIS TECHNOLOGY REACHES ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SOME MORE SUPPORTING OUR STATE'S AMBITIOUS CLIMBING GOALS. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR PROPOSES ON AN ALTERNATIVE THAT ENSURES OPEN ACCESS TO CHARGING STATIONS WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SO FAR. I WOULD IT WOULD REQUIRE CHARGING STATIONS TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS. TAKEN OVER THE PHONE IN AT LEAST TWO ADDITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS INCLUDING A CREDIT CARD READER OPTION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME WITH ME TODAY ARE CHRIS ROSE A RIVERS IN THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. AND MARGOT LOK CIARA FROM THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR PROVIDES ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE PROVIDERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CUSTOMER CHOICE AND PAYMENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS. REQUIRING PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS WILL BE COSTLY AND THESE ADDED COSTS WILL HAMPER EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER LEVEL TWO AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGER WITH OVER TEN THOUSAND CHARGERS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE RETROFITTED TO COMPLY WITH AT A COST OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR STATIONS WITH PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DISINCENTIVE TO SITE HOST TO MAKE THEIR STATIONS PUBLIC. REQUIRING PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS WILL UNDERMINE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS INVESTED NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE V. CHARGING STATIONS HALF OF WHICH HAVE SUPPORTED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. CHARGERS WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED UNDER THESE REGULATIONS THERE'S ALSO CONCERNED THAT REQUIRING PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS HAMPER ACCESS TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR'S REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TITLED OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. IT STATES THAT MANY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS LACK CREDIT CARDS AND BANK ACCOUNTS. GIVEN THE A ARBY'S OWN RECOGNITION THAT CREDIT CARDS ARE A BIGGER YEAR FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IT'S CLEAR THAT CREDIT CARD READERS MANDATE WOULD NOT EXPAND ACCESS TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. PLUS SMARTPHONES ARE MORE PREVALENT THAN CREDIT CARDS ACROSS ALL DEMOGRAPHICS. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S EVEY DEPLOYMENT GOALS OF FIVE MILLION EVEY IS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND A QUARTER MILLION CHARGING POINTS BY THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE DESIRE TO EXPAND EVEY ACCESS WE BELIEVE BY GIVING INDUSTRY THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CUSTOMER CHOICE AND A DEVELOPMENT IN TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE. THESE GOALS BETTER RATHER THAN MANDATING A LITTLE USED AND SOON TO BE OUTDATED PAYMENT METHOD. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN CLIMATE ACTION AS WELL AS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY PLEASE LET US CONTINUE TO LEAD THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON YOU'RE GOING. TO GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURNED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAKE A LECTURE ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION. AS X. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN RUFFORD WE'RE CONCERNED WITH HOW THIS REGULATION ROOM PACKED THE THE THE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STATE. OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE AND IMPACT OF CLIMATE GOALS AND OUR ADOPTION OF FIVE MILLION YOU FEES. FIRST OFF THE NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND CHARGING STARTERS INSTALLED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE TO COULD DECADES TO BUILD OUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND IT TOOK A COMBINATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT STATE DOLLARS AND REPAIR FUNDS. THE REGULATION AS PROPOSED THREATENS TO WIPE OUT A SIZEABLE PORTION OF THIS INVESTMENT. WE DO NOT THINK THIS IS AN EFFICIENT USE OF LIMITED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT DOLLARS. FURTHERMORE THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS REGULATION. THE ADDED COSTS WILL. CAN WILL SEVERELY IMPACT HOW MUCH MORE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE DEPLOYED BY A ARBY'S OWN ESTIMATE IT RANGES FROM A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN GET SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE CHARGING STATIONS OUT THERE. WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IT INCREASES THE COST OF THE -- CHARGING STE CHARGING STATION TO AN EXTENT FOR IT MIGHT BECOME UNAFFORDABLE FOR A SITE HOSTED A CUSTOMER TO EVEN AFFORD A RUNNING AN OPERATING A CHARGING STATION -- AND AND THIS WILL LEAD TO TO CONSEQUENCES ONE OF WHICH A CHART OF A SITE OR NUMBER TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF OF THE CHARGING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGING STATION THIS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. AND COULD LEAD DOWN TO SHUT DOWNS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE REASON BEING THAT CHARGING STATIONS ARE USE LAST AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED THE MOST. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO BUSINESS THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO YOU KNOW -- PUT CHARGING STATIONS OUT THERE AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE BEEN OF OPEN TO MOST OF THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE BILL ALL OF THEM. INCLUDING CONTACTLESS CARDS AND IT. AS WE SEE IT AS WE SEE PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES INCREASINGLY MOVING AWAY FROM EMV CHIP READERS THE DIGITAL AND CONTEST LESS FORMS OF PAYMENT. ALSO -- SINCE CARD READERS ARE EXTERNAL. TO TO THE CHARGING STATIONS WEATHER ELEMENTS CAN LEAD TO FREQUENT MALFUNCTIONS AND CAN CAN YOU TO HIRE MONTH FUNCTION COSTS. AND ART THIS COULD BE TO THE DETRIMENT OF CONSUMERS IN EUROPE -- WHERE MOST OF THE CHARGING STATIONS DO NOT ENOUGH INCLUDE CHART -- IN BE READERS ARE DISPLAYS THE RELIABILITY RATE IS NINETY NINE POINT 7% WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT HERE IF WE INSTALL THESE CREDIT CARD READERS. AS AN INDUSTRY WE SHARE THE ARBY'S GOAL FOR UNIVERSAL CONVENIENT AT NECK QUITABLE ACCESS TO CHARGING STATIONS WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MULTIPLE PAYMENT MECHANISMS PROPOSED MAYBE. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR ARE CONSISTENT WITH CONSUMER PAYMENT TRENDS WITH GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES AND MORE TECHNOLOGY IN REGULATION. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE DRY VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS SPEAKERS -- JUST STATE YOUR NAME AND OCT YOU KNOW GROUP THE REPRESENT THEIR AT KROGER'S WITH ET CONNECT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOR IS. MUCH NEEDED LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AS CHAIR MARK PRIOR HERE ON BEHALF OF CHARGE POINT WE ALSO SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE PRIOR SPEAKERS WE ARE TRYING YOU. STRUCTURE MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GOING TO BE AT THE COALITION CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] OKAY. MR CHER CAM DIMITRI WITH TECHNO AND STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL. OKAY -- OKAY -- LET'S HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSE OPPOSE. TO THIS BILL WERE ON AB. ONE FOUR TWO FOUR WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CATHERINE GARCIA WITH ON BEHALF OF THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA OPPOSES ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES EVERY SOURCES BOARDS OF FORTY TO ENSURE MORE RELIABLE AND EQUITABLE CHARGER ACCESS. FOR ALL EVEY DRIVERS THIS BILL SHOULD BE HELD SINCE CARBS REGULATORY PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY -- BASED ON THE EEVEE CHARGING STATIONS OPEN ACCESS BACK FROM. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE RULE WILL GO TO VOTE IN TWO DAYS. CALIFORNIANS ONE A STATE IN WHICH ALL RESIDENTS CAN PURCHASE CAN ANTICIPATE CLEAN AIR DAYS. AND WHERE WE CAN REDUCE CRIME IT POLLUTIONFROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES WE HAVE SAID A CRITICAL GOAL OF REACHING FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON OUR ROADS BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS REQUIRES THAT WE MAKE IT AS ACCESSIBLE AND CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE TO USE EVEY CHARGING STATIONS. AB DRIVERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHARGE THEIR CAR AT CHARGING STATIONS WITH A CREDIT CARD JUST AS THEY WOULD EXPECT TO RE FUEL AT GAS STATIONS. AND GAS STATIONS ARE NOT SAYING THAT CREDIT CARD READERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AROUND IN A FEW YEARS YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE'RE USING TODAY AND IT WILL BE GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. GIVEN THAT RANGING VARIETY IS A REAL CONCERN THE CHARGING EXPERIENCE SHOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATING IF THE CHARTER DOESN'T HAVE A CREDIT CARD READER. USERS MUST EITHER OBTAIN A MEMBERSHIP CARD IN ADVANCE OR DOWN THE CHARGING COMPANIES MOBILE APP IN THIS HAS THREE REQUIREMENTS. THAT MEANS THE USER MUST HAVE A SMARTPHONE SUFFICIENT CELL PHONE COVERAGE AND AMPLE DATA. WE SHOULD STRIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ELIMINATING ANY BARRIERS TO EXPAND EVEY ADOPTION TO A BROADER BASE OF DRIVERS. DEVELOPING RELIABLE AND EASY TO USE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY AND OTHERS SPEAKERS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. MR CARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN REPRESENTING COALITION CLEAN AIR. UNFORTUNATELY CALLS FOR CLEAN AIR MUST POSE A. B.. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA FACES A PRESSING NEED TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION FROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE TWO ZERO NATION TRANSITION -- TRANSPORTATION WE MUST UP A BAR EMISSION REDUCTION EFFORTS AND THAT MEANS MAKING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ACCESSIBLE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF DRIVERS. SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN ENVISIONED A MARKET FOR EVEY IS NOT JUST FOR THE TECH SAVVY NOT JUST FOR THE WELL HEELED. BUT FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE STAGE FOR SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE WAS SET IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR WHICH MISTER CHAIRMAN I BELIEVE YOU ORDERED FOR AS DID SENATOR GALGIANI. SB FOR FOOD FOR PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK SO EVEY CHARGING STATIONS COULD OPERATE LIKE GAS STATIONS TO BEST ASSIST THE STATE IN REACHING ITS THEY HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION. AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION GOALS. DRIVERS CAN FILL UP THE GAS STATIONS WITH THE CHARGE CARD THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO AT CHARGING STATIONS. WE'RE STRIVING FOR TRANSITION TO MISSION FREE VEHICLES THAT IS IS IS IS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE LIMITING PAYMENT METHODS. TO PAY UP PRIOR -- TO RFID TAGS A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER OR OTHER CONTACTLESS METHODS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE WAY TO GET THERE. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ARE ARE -- EVEY ADOPTION GOALS -- PUBLIC CHARGING CAN BE NEITHER INCONVENIENT OR CONFUSING AND JUST -- NOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT. CHARGE CARDS ARE A METHOD OF THE PAST ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN BANKING ASSOCIATION. BY THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION OPEN CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS -- STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AT LEAST. SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS HAVE AT LEAST ONE CREDIT CARD IN THEIR WALLETS SO DID THE DEATH KNELL THE TO BEING RUN BY SOME FOR CREDIT CARDS I THINK IS. A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. OTHER SPEAKERS OF IN FAVOR -- DOUBTFIRE YOUR ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION. ONLY PLEASE THANK YOU. THIS IS THE OPPOSITION. WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION YEAH? OPPOSITION PLEASE OPPOSITION START. GOOD AFTERNOON -- TEAR BILL BILL -- BY SIR BATES AND THERE WAS A COMMITTEE MINIMUS AIR CARLIN ARABS AND GREEN LOTS -- GROUND IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF EASY CHARGING SOFTER AND SERVICES AND EVEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN GROWING MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION. ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- I'M HERE TODAY TO COMMUNICATE GREEN LOTS DISAPPOINTMENT WITH AND A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENT VERSION OF A. B.. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR GREEN NOT TESTIFIED IT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SIX YEARS AGO IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FIVE FOR WHICH THE INSTANT. LEGISLATION WOULD A REPLACE -- WILL SLOW TO DEVELOP THE A RESOURCE BOARD LEAD REGULATORY PROCESS IS NEARING FINALIZATION WE DO NOT SUPPORT CURTAILING. OR OTHERWISE SUPERSEDING THAT PROCESS THE LEGISLATION. WELL -- THE REGULATION MAYBE IN PERFECT IT IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND WE BELIEVE THE REGULATORY PROCESS PROVIDES GROUP BUS AN APPROPRIATE VENUE -- FOR ALL PARTIES -- TO STATED HE SENT A BALANCED DIVERSE POLICY AND MARKET PERSPECTIVES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE SP FOUR FIVE FOUR WAS CREATED OPEN AND ACTUAL ACCESS TO CHARGE HIM A STRUCTURE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THIS WITH THESE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL ESTABLISH A MORE SUSTAINABLE MARKET AND INDUSTRY. AB FOURTEENTH. THE FOURTH STANDS TO UNDERMINE DECAL AT PUTTING PUTTING CERTAIN CORPORATE INTERESTS IN FRONT OF THE CHARGING PUBLIC. CRITICALLY THE BILL CONSERVE FUSES FLEXIBILITY AN OPTION AUDI FOR CREATING CHARGING -- FOR FOR A FOR CONSUMERS ACCESS CHARTING A STRUCTURE WITH CORPORATE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO PROVIDE THAT ACCESS -- WELL THIS BILL HAS PUT THE INDUSTRY. IT SHOULD BE ILLUSTRATIVE THAT ALL THE CONSUMER GROUPS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND INFORMAL JUSTICE GROUPS THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN OPPOSE THIS BILL. IN CONCLUSION GREEN LAST DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SUPERSEDE AS BEFORE BUT FOR AND CAR DEALERS THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND AS SUCH GREEN MONTHS OR DOES YOUR NOTEBOOK VOTE. OR AT LEAST A FOR ACTION UNTIL AFTER CARP ACTS ON THURSDAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MILES MILLAR SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. -- FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD UNDERMINE RELIABLE ACCESSBY PROHIBITING ANY STATE AGENCY FROM REQUIRING CHARGING STATIONS ACCEPT CREDIT CARD PAYMENT. IN THE FORM THE MOST ALIGNED WITH CUSTOMER EXPECTATION IN UNIVERSAL ACCESS. BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR CHARGING AT THE STATIONS JUST AS THEY WOULD EXPECT TO BE ABLE. TO A GAS STATIONS ARE PARKING METERS. NOT RESIGNED CONTACTLESS CARDS OR PROPRIETARY FOBS. WHICH MANY CUSTOMERS MAY LACK. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD ALSO UNDERMINE AN ONGOING PUBLIC REGULATORY PROCESS UNDER WAY AT A ARE BEING. UNDER THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO IT BY SB. FOUR FIFTY FOUR WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE EAGERNESS TO MOVE TO THE PAYMENT FORMS OF THE FUTURE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE CHARGING STATIONS APPOINT TODAY ARE LINED WITH THE PAYMENT FORMS OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT LEAVE ANY DRIVERS BEHIND IN PREMATURELY RACING TOWARDS THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD THIS BILL FOR NOW UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A OR B. AS FINISH THE ONGOING REGULATORY PROCESS THANK YOU. JUST SECOND -- OKAY [inaudible] OKAY ONE WHICH YES GO HEAD START AND MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPULETS REPRESENTING PLUG IN AMERICA WE WERE THE ORIGINAL SPONSOR OF SENATOR CORBETT'S BILL.

PROCESS COMPLETES ITS WORK ON THURSDAY IT'S BEEN AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS THANK YOU -- OKAY -- QUESTION MARK COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WHILE I I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SPOKEN OPPOSITION OF MY BILL I THINK THEIR OPPOSITION TO LITTLE MISPLACED A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT WERE MADE. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR DOES NOT GUT SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR THE OPTIONS LAID OUT MAYBE FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR ARE STRONGER. IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY IN CONSUMER CHOICE THE EXISTING LAW UNDER AS BEFORE FIFTY FOUR I'M GOING TO DETAILS OF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS -- THE ISSUE OF CREDIT CARDS VERSES MOBILE PHONES WAS BROUGHT WAS BROUGHT UP. A WE WANNA MAKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ACCESSIBLE TO FOLKS IN ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL INCOME LEVELS THAT PAYMENT STANDARDS UNDER A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR DO NOT REQUIRE DRIVERS TO HAVE A SMART PHONE. TWO USING THE V. CHARGING STATION BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP IS MORE YOU BAKER THIS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN CREDIT CARD OWNERSHIP IS 67% OF ADULTS EARNING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. ON A SMART UP ON A SMARTPHONE THE CORNER PEW RESEARCH CENTER AND ONLY 60%. OF HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON A CREDIT CARD. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESERVE DATA FROM. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE ISSUE OF CELL RECEPTION WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP REQUIRING CREDIT CARD READERS WOULD NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE OF A CELL PHONE NOT HAVING RECEPTION WHICH CREDIT CARD READERS ALSO NEED CELL PHONE RECEPTION.
