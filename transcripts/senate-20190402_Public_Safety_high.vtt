AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS POLICY IS

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.836
SO IMPORTANT IS THAT -- THERE

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.705
WAS A CASE WHERE A COUPLE WAS

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:09.509

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.389
KIND OF THING WE WANNA POINT

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:23.756
WITH THIS LAW.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.591
BASED ON DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED

SINGLE PURCHASE WITHIN A THIRTY

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.443
DAY PERIOD SO MOST GUN BUYERS

ACTUALLY WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.412

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.224
CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.191
SO THE REASON WHY WE BRING THIS

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:20.793
MEASURE FORWARD IS BECAUSE ON

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.428
RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.564
STATUTE.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.199
AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED NON

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.667
MEDICAL MODEL SO IT'S SOMEONE'S

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:31.203
HOME FOR EXAMPLE A SIX BED UNIT

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.405

ON WITHIN THIS MODEL AS OUR

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:38.711
AGING POPULATION HAS GROWN

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:41.180
SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT 70% OF

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.281
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THESE

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:43.616

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.354
DISORDERS AND AS SUCH YOU KNOW

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.089
WE GO IN AND THERE'S A GUN JUST

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:51.924
SITTING ON A DESK OR A GUN IN A

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:52.458

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:54.994
STORED AND WE CAN'T TELL THEM

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.527
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THEIR

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:56.595
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.664

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:05.738
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:06.972
SON MECHANISM THAT THOSE

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.407
FIREARMS ARE STORED PROPERLY.

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:09.742
MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WHEN

WITH THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:10.569
WHO TAKES MY ARMS AND WHO

INTO ONE OF THESE FACILITIES

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:21.213
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S CREATED AS A

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:21.546
RESIDENTIAL.

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.315
FACILITY YOU CAN BRING YOUR

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:25.083

MEDICAL ON WHICH IS HOUSE

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.289
CREATED IN.

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:31.957
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE HAVING SAID

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.792
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.360
EQUIPPED MEDICARE LICENSING WITH

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:37.329
THE ABILITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:39.031
WHAT'S IN THAT FACILITY AND HOW.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.532
TO APPROPRIATELY DETERMINE IF

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:42.234
IT'S STORED PROPERLY SWITCHES

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.669
SETTING STANDARDS ARE A WIDE BUT

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:44.670
AGAIN WE NEED TO CONTINUE

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:45.337
WORKING ON THAT BECAUSE WE NEED

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:46.038
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:47.706
COMMUNITY ARE LICENSING HAS THE

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.508
ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:50.742
THAT SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.843
WORK ON WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.778
STAFF MOVING FOR AND I'M CLEAR

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:53.979
THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.247
TO BRING THEIR PROPERTY AND BUT

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.815
IT IS A COMMUNITY.

00:21:56.882 --> 00:21:59.317
RESIDENTIAL FACILITY OSCAR AND

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.252
SO FOR ME THAT MAKES A

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:01.586
DIFFERENCE THAT'S WHY COMMUNITY

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.922
CARE LICENSING IS INVOLVED IN

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.490
THEIR OVERSIGHT BUT TYPICALLY

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:06.758
RUN HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT AS

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.460
THE PRIMARY ROLE OF COMMUNITY.

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:10.395
CARE LICENSING IS HEALTH AND

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.830
SAFETY SO THIS CERTAINLY FITS

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:13.098
WITHIN THAT CAPS I'LL FOLLOW UP

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.383
CALENDAR YEAR.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.718
REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:42.087
FIREARM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO SELL

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:44.289
LEASE OR TRANSFER FIREARMS

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.391
WITHOUT LEGALLY BEING REQUIRED

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:47.993
TO OBTAIN A LICENSE.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.227
THERE IS A DISPARITY IN THE

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.796
PENAL CODE DEFINITION OF THE

00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:53.198
TERM INFREQUENT WHICH RESULTS IN

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.733
A DISPARITY IN THE WAY IN WHICH

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.735
I'M LICENSED SELLERS OF FIREARMS

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.170
ARE TREATED UNDER THE LAW.

00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:59.771
INDIVIDUALS MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:01.540
REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.408
SELL FIREARMS DEPENDING ON THE

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.744
TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.846
IN SOME INSTANCES THIS MAY

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:10.315
EXEMPT. FOR EXAMPLE NON PROFITS

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:11.349
FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH A

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.485
LICENSED DEALER WHEN RALF LAYER

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.786
AUCTIONING A FIREARM.

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:16.655
THIS DISPARATE TREATMENT CAUSES

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:19.524
CONFUSION AND MAKES IT UNCLEAR.

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:21.693
IF AND WHEN SELLERS ARE REQUIRED

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.862
TO AND SHOULD OBTAIN A LICENSE

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.497
TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS.

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:26.965
TRANSACTION IN TRANSACTING

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:31.236
pFOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS FOR

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.604
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.906
A LACK OF A BRIGHT LINE RULE.

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.474
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:38.109
STANDARDIZE THE DEFINITION OF

00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:39.544
THE TERM INFREQUENT.

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:43.849
IT ALSO IS INTENDED TO REDUCE

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:44.583
THE FREQUENCY.

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:45.417
AND NUMBER OF FIREARMS IN

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:47.018
INDIVIDUAL IS ALLOWED TO SELL OR

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.820
MANUFACTURE ANNUALLY WITHOUT A

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.455
LICENSE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD HAVE

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:52.724
SOME LIMITS WITH WITHOUT A DOUBT.

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.092
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A SINGLE

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.627
LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.429
TRANSACTIONS AND UNLICENSED

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.297
INDIVIDUAL IS AFFORDED IN A YEAR

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:01.032
REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:02.667
FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED.

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:03.568
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.670
CONSIDERATION WERE TRANSACTIONS

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:07.739
MAY HAVE BEEN A MIXTURE OF

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:09.441
VARIOUS TYPES OF FIREARM.

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:10.108
THE BILL.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.643
WOULD ALSO LIMIT THE TOTAL

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.978
NUMBER OF FIREARMS INDIVIDUALS

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.512
ARE ABLE TO SELL LEASE OR

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:17.115
TRANSFER. TO NO MORE THAN FIFTY

POR YOU PER YEAR WITHOUT HAVING

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.086
TO OBTAIN A LICENSE THAT SEEMS

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:22.454
REASONABLE TO ME.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.755
GOING FORWARD ON LICENSE

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.023
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.625
CONDUCT UP TO FIVE SEPARATE

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:28.660
TRANSACTIONS AND SO LONG AS THE

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:30.095
ANNUAL NUMBER OF FIREARMS

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:32.564
TRANSACTED ARE LESS THAN.

00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:33.999
FIFTY THEY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:35.734
TO HAVE A LICENSE INDIVIDUALS BE

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.235
REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE IF

THEY ARE SELLING LEASING OR

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.405
TRANSFERRING OR MANUFACTURING

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.140
MORE THAN FIFTY FARMS YEAR.

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.441
REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:45.377
FIREARM A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS

00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:47.145
WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:47.579
AMENDMENTS WITH THE

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.714
UNDERSTANDING -- INDIVIDUALS MAY

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:51.683
NEED TO TRANSACT MORE FREQUENTLY

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.351
THAN FIVE TIMES OR MORE WITH A

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:55.720
VOLUME OF FIFTY OVER A COURSE OF

THE YEAR IF THEY FALL -- WITHOUT

00:25:57.689 --> 00:26:01.226
OBTAINING A LOT A LICENSE THESE

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:02.494
EXEMPTIONS ARE.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.062
DEATH DIVORCE STORAGE EVEN

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.063
TRIGGERING A PROBATION FROM

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.432
OWNING A FIREARM OR WHEN A

DEALER IS IN -- CURIOS OR RELICS

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.904
SO THERE'S THERE'S WAS A ASH

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:15.006
LONG DISCUSSION WITH THE O. J.

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.641
ON WHERE TO APPROPRIATELY DRAW

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.977
THESE LINES AND WE THINK WE HAVE.

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.345
CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.180
FIRST STATE INSTITUTE LICENSING

ANY INDIVIDUAL AND I KNOW.

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:32.757
THAT SENATOR JACKSON LIT UP WHEN

WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SOME

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.323
BILLS IN THE SENATE THIS YEAR.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.325
INTRODUCED IN OVER EIGHTEEN

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.593
HUNDRED IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.061
THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.696
ALWAYS COMPLAIN THAT ALL WE DO

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:27.832
IS PUT LAWS ON THE BOOKS WE

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.200
NEVER TAKEN THE OFF.

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.568
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.303
IN MY OFFICE IS I'VE GOT A

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.539
NUMBER OF INTERNS FROM SENIORS

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:35.940

ALL TWENTY NINE CODES OF THE

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:41.279
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:42.847
LOOKING FOR STUFF THAT WE COULD

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.749
FIND I'M LOOKING UP HERE AND I

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.117
SEE MISTER DRAKE FRANCES DRAKE

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.285
THAT WAS SOMETHING WE TRY TO

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:48.686
LOOK AT THERE'S ALL THESE LAWS

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.054
WE LOOKED AT EVERY TIME WE LOOK

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:51.122
TO THE LAW WE FOUND SOME

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.491
INTEREST GROUP.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:54.392
WANTED TO KEEP IT ON THE BOOKS.

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:55.126
AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL ONE

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:57.862
HERE I THINK THAT THERE IS NO

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.297
BASIS TO HOLD THIS LAW.

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.698
IT CONTINUE ON THE BOOKS IN THE

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.567
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:03.901
ELIMINATE THIS LAW.

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:06.704
BASICALLY PENAL CODE SECTION ONE

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.973
FIFTY MAKES IT A CRIME A CRIME

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.741
FOR ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:11.442
EIGHTEEN IN CALIFORNIA TO

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:13.811
WILLFULLY OR NEGLIGENT REFUSED

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.112
TO JOIN THE POSSE.

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.681
AND IMPOSE A FINE OF A THOUSAND

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:18.449
DOLLARS UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.584
NOW UNDERSTAND OF WHAT WE'VE

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.219
HEARD HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.920
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS A THOUSAND

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.255
DOLLARS NOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:25.590
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.425
CORD ASSESSMENTS FOR A ROLLING

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:28.926
STOP IS THIRTY FIVE BUCKS BY THE

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.228
TIME YOU GET STUCK WITH THE BILL

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.596
IT'S FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:32.630
SO WE KNOW THAT.

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:33.664
IT'S NOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A TO

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:36.767
DO THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COST

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:37.468
WOULD BE.

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:38.069
THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHEN

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.370
YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND WE DID

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.472

SEVENTY TWO LAW.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.275
AND IT LITERALLY WAS PRESERVING

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.776
THE PEACE ON THE WESTERN FRONT

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.211
TIER IN APPREHENDING RUNAWAY

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.779
SLAVES.

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.248
SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:52.783
APPROPRIATE ANY LEVEL IN TERMS

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.318
OF OUR CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.053
AND SO TE ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.388
MADE OF COURSE IS WILL HIS

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:59.557

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:02.360

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.061

IMPOSE THAT OBLIGATION BECAUSE

00:36:15.406 --> 00:36:16.707
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.677
MAKING IT A CRIME NOT TO HELP.

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:21.178

IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HOSTED A

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:55.706

MAKE THE BILL MORE FLEXIBLE AS A

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.211
RESULT WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.914
SECURITY OPTIONS FROM.

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.916

COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:13.290
SIX SECURITY OPTIONS WHEN STORE

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.726
IN THEIR GUNS WHILE THE STORE IS

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:16.493
CLOSED.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.295
LOCK THE GUNS IN A SAFE LOCK

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.430
THEM WITH A STEEL CABLE AND

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.198
INSTALL BOLLARDS IN FRONT OF THE

OR LOCK THE GUNS IN A GUN RACK

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:28.372
WITH A LOCKING STEEL BAR.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:29.840
THEY COULD ALSO LOCKED THE GUNS

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.642
IN A WINDOW WINDOWLESS SECURE

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:34.778

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.083
OR LOCK THE GUNS IN A GUN

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:41.018
CABINET MADE WITH STEEL AND

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.686
POLYCARBONATE SHEETS WE ALSO

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.455
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BY SIX

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:46.223
MONTHS TO GIVE TIME FOR STORAGE

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.725
TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE.

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.593
IT'S APPARENT FROM MY MEETINGS

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.094
AT MANY SHORE GUNNED.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.662
MANY GUN STORES ARE ALREADY IN

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.364
COMPLIANCE WITH AT LEAST ONE OF

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.631
THESE REQUIREMENTS AND AS A

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:55.566
RESULT I THINK THIS BILL WILL

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:57.534
IMPACT A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF

00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:58.602
STORES.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:43:59.770
I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO WORK

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.305
WITH GUN STORE OWNERS ON THE

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:03.040
AMENDMENTS BUT YOU MAY HEAR THAT

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.575
SOME DEALERS REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:05.242
WELL I BELIEVE WE BROUGHT

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.977
GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO THE BILL

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.579
THERE WERE A FEW ISSUES WE

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:09.980
COULDN'T RESOLVE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.048
IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.516
ELIMINATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:15.652
THEIR OWN REGULATIONS.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:16.954
HOWEVER THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.856
BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE NINETEEN

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:19.890
NINETY THREE AND IT WAS NEVER

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.258
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.127
UNDERMINE THAT LOCAL CONTROL I

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.294

THIS BILL.

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.237
IS SUPPORTED BY THE BRADY

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.061
SENATOR HELL ACTUALLY STARTED TO

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.997

THOSE LOCAL ORDINANCES HAPPEN ON

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.035
THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.604
CUSTOMIZED FOR THE RETAIL

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.340

ROSEVILLE AREA BASS PRO SHOPS

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.378
ONE TO BEEN ABLE -- UNDER THE

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:03.213
PRIOR CONFIGURATION OF THE BILL

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.382
TO EVEN SERVICE IT'S BOATS

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:05.849
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:06.617
REQUIREMENTS.

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.385
SENATOR HILL DID ATTEMPT TO

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.686
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:11.922
HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A STATE.

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.591
A STATE LAW ON TOP OF LOCAL

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.860
ORDINANCES AND YOU PROVIDE NO

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.862
CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR THE RETAILER

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.765
THEY CAN BE CAUGHT IN A CATCH --

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.200
TWENTY TWO IT ALSO INDICATES

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:26.770
THAT THE LICENSING ENTITY MAY --

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.705
YOU KNOW GRANT AN EXEMPTION IF

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:29.740
THEY'RE GET CAUGHT IN SUCH A

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.174
CONFLICT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.743
THAT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.945
PRESCRIPTIVE SO THAT YOU ARE

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.481
GRANTED -- THE AUTHORIZATION IF

00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:38.949
YOU'RE IN CONFLICT IT CREATES

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.350
KIND OF A CHILLING EFFECT ON

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.886
BUSINESS THIS COULD BE -- I'M I

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:43.987
KNOW SENATOR HILLS INTENTIONS

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:45.622
ARE VERY GOOD BUT THIS COULD BE

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.691
USED IN A WAY -- THAT COULD BE

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.459
USED TO DERIVE THOSE BUSINESSES

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.361
OUT OF A JURISDICTION BY THE

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:52.929
STATE LOBBYING IN PLACE AND THEN

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.031
WE'RE GOING TO PUT EVEN MORE

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:55.766
STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AT THE

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:56.833
LOCAL LEVEL.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.168
SO WE BE LOOKING FOR THE STATE

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.637
STANDARD TO BE THE THRESHOLD

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:01.872
THEN THAT COULDN'T BE EXCEEDED.

00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:07.210

HAVE LEFT IT TO LOCAL

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.627
JURISDICTION AND THE REASON I

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.228
RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN I

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:07.464
LOOK AT IN OUR COMMITTEE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:10.434
ANALYSIS -- WE WERE PROVIDED

OCCURRENCE.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:13.662
ORTHODOX CHURCH.

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:14.997
THE PROTESTANT REFORMED

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:16.399
TRADITION IS FOUND IN THE

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.300
LUTHERAN EPISCOPAL IN

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:19.602
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES.

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:20.669
OTHER CHURCHES ALSO HAVE

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:22.671
CONFESSION AS PART OF THEIR

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.640
RELIGIOUS PRACTICES SUCH AS THE

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.642
AMERICAN BAPTIST METHODIST

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.444
LATTER DAY SAINTS IN CHURCH OF

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.979
SCIENTOLOGY.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:32.047
ANECDOTALLY IN PROVIDING LEGAL

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.650
COUNSEL -- TO PASTORS I WOULD

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.619
ESTIMATE THAT HALF OF

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.154
EVANGELICAL FUNDAMENTALISTS IN

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.890
PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES MAINTAIN

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:42.358
STRICT CONFIDENCES.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.193
SUCH THAT THEY WILL NOT REPORT

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.628
CONFESSION OF CRIMES NOR WILL

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.430
THEY TESTIFY IN COURT IF

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.631
SUBPOENAED.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.399
BY REMOVING THE CLERGY PENITENT

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.102
PRIVILEGE SUCH REQUIRES CLERGY

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.737
TO SAIL BETWEEN THE SOLO.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.939
AND GROUP THIS THEY MUST CHOOSE

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.908
BETWEEN CRIMINAL LIABILITY OR

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:00.543
SPIRITUAL PERIL.

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.978
FAILURE TO IMMEDIATELY BRING IN

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.548
THE POLICE SUBJECTS MINISTERS TO

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.416
PROSECUTION IN JAIL.

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.784
BUT DISCLOSING VIOLATES THE

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.219
RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN A SACRED

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.720
TRUST.

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:12.888
THE BILL OF RIGHTS IN OUR

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.390
CONSTITUTION.

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.826
IS A SECULAR DECALOGUE FEW WELL.

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:20.029
IS A LIST OF DO'S AND DON'TS.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.697
DIRECTED AT THE GOVERNMENT.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.165
PASSAGE OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.767
WOULD BREAK THE FIRST CLAUSE OF

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.402
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT IF YOU

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:27.236
WILL.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.437
THE RELIGION CLAUSE PROVIDES

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.639
THAT NO LAW CAN BE PASSED THAT

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.274
PROHIBITS THE FREE EXERCISE OF

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.109
RELIGION.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.411
PLACING CLERGY IN A POSITION

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.346
SUCH THAT THEY WILL BE CORD BY

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.614
ONE OR THE OTHER OF TWO FORMS OF

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.615
A DILEMMA.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:42.218
IS PRECISELY WHAT THE FIRST

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:43.686
AMENDMENT FORBIDS.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.920
JUST AS CONGRESS RIGHTLY

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:46.622
EXEMPTED CLERGY FROM THE

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.125
MILITARY DRAFT SO TO THIS BODY

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.192

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.266
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:59.101
PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:00.436

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:01.670
IN RELATION TO REPORTING CSE

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.405
SUSPICIONS OF CHILD ABUSE AND

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:04.540
NEGLECT.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.408
CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.810
TOOL OF THE STATE MADAM CHAIRMAN

AND OFFER MYSELF AS A AS A

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.778
PERSON TO TALK TO AS TO WHY WE

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.979
WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.347
IN THE ME FIRST START BY SAYING

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:48.284
IT IS A SELF DEFEATING BILL AND

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:48.918
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:56.492
OPPOSE.

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:56.959
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.995
OPPOSITION.

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.331
ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:04.033
FROM YES SENATOR JACKSON'S.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:07.636
YES -- TO THE ATTORNEY -- WHO'S

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.305
HERE ASIDE MENTIONED EARLIER

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:09.939
WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.206
AMENDMENT.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.942
WE HAVE NO AMENDMENTS THAT ARE

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.210
ON RESTRICTED AND ON QUALIFIED

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.712
AND CERTAINLY THE FIRST

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:19.548
AMENDMENT IN TERMS OF FREEDOM.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:20.616
OF RELIGION.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.017
WE DO HAVE LAWS PROHIBITING

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.285
BIGAMY.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:27.089
AND THOSE ARE -- CONTRARY TO

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.757
SERVICE CERTAIN RELIGIOUS GROUPS

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.559
SO THERE IS NO AMENDMENT THAT IS

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:34.597
WITHOUT SOME RESTRICTIONS -- IN

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.498
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:39.001
THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:44.106
THAT -- WE HAVE HAD.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.908
A PLAGUE AN EPIDEMIC.

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:52.247
OF EXCUSES AND CLAIMS OF

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.415
RELIGION.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:57.252
WHICH HAVE ALLOWED PER FILES.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.188
AND ABUSERS.

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:01.957
TO EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:04.326
WORLD -- UNFETTERED. FOR FAR TOO

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.562
LONG.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.298
AND THE NOTION THAT TO A TALKING

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.633
ABOUT AT THE SERVICE OF THE

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.901
STATE I WOULD SUBMIT.

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:14.770
THAT IT IS IMMORAL AND AGAINST

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.239
GOD'S WILL FOR PEOPLE TO ABUSE

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:18.540
CHILDREN.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.042
AND I THINK IT IS THE

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.644
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:24.013
DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO MAKE

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:25.881
SURE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.783
I THINK WE WOULD BE REMISS IN

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.952
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO ACCEPT

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:32.554
ANY CLAIM THAT RELIGION.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:35.057
AND MAY I ADD MANMADE RELIGION.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.960
SUPERSEDES THE PROTECTIONS THAT

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:40.696
WE ALL -- CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.598
IN OUR SOCIETY SO I WOULD

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:44.433
SUGGEST THAT TO YOUR FIRST

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.568
AMENDMENT ARGUMENT.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.704
IS OUTDATED -- THIS WAS

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:49.638
MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY OTHER

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.073
STATES WHERE THIS HAS TAKEN

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.510
PLACE WITHOUT REPERCUSSION.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.945
THAT THE STATE THE PEOPLE DO

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.781
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT CERTAIN

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.582
PRACTICES THAT ARE BELIEVED TO

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:04.019
BE INAPPROPRIATE IMMORAL.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:07.623
OF AND TO A CERTAINLY TO US GIVE

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:08.524
A PASS BECAUSE SOMEONE GOES IN

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.459
AND CONFESSES BEHAVIOR THAT IS

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:13.195
OFFENSIVE. TO MANKIND AND

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.464
PROBABLY TO GOD BUT I'LL LET GOD

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:18.467
MAKE THAT DECISION -- I DON'T

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.803
PRETEND TO KNOW.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:25.541
OF THE WEATHER -- WHETHER THIS

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:26.475
IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:29.078
ACCEPTABLE BUT I SUSPECT.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.246
EVEN THE NOTION OF GOOD AND EVIL

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:33.148
AND GOD BEING GOOD AND THE DEVIL

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:33.716
BEING EVIL.

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.919
THAT -- IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.387
THAT RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION THAT'S

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.222
WHERE I THINK WE WOULD LAND ON

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:42.124
GOD'S SIDE IN THE SIDE OF GOOD.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:46.562
BUT WE ARE A WE ARE A SOCIETY WE

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.297
ARE GOVERNED BY LAWS WE ARE

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.232
GOVERNED BY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.867
BE WHAT IS MORALLY CORRECT.

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:52.835
AND WHAT IS IN THE BEST

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.870
INTERESTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:58.140
SOCIETY AND I WOULD SUBMIT.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.276
HAVING ACCEPTING AND CONDONING

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.278
ALLOWING THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:05.414
TO CONTINUE ON A CLAIM OF

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.782
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM I THINK IS

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:09.384
ANATHEMA. TO EVERYTHING WE HOLD

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.453
DEAR AND I HOPE IT IS ANATHEMA

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.521
TO EVERYTHING THAT HOLE WE HOLD

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.923
DEAR SO FIRST AMENDMENT.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.859
ON NOT UNLIMITED SECOND MOMENT

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.894
NOT UNLIMITED WE ARE A SOCIETY

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:21.096
OF HUMAN BEINGS AND WE TRY TO

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:22.464
PROTECT OURSELVES IN EACH

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.766
OTHER'S BEST WE CAN.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.900
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.435
BRINGING THIS BILL AND WITH

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:27.469
THANK THE WITNESSES FOR COMING

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.104
FORWARD I'M SURE THIS WAS NOT AN

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.873
EASY THING TO DO BUT THIS HAS

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:33.242
GOT TO STOP.

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:33.842
AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.144
BILL.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.979

MISTER SNYDER I JUST WANNA.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.622
SAY THAT WE'VE EXEMPTED

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.457
PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:49.558
WHEN IT WAS FIRST ADDRESSED BACK

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.894
IN?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:52.494
NINETY SEVEN BUT WE STILL HAVE

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.896
FAILURES.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.998
SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS YOUR WHAT

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:59.268

WHAT WAS JUST STATED NO WITH

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.144

WE STOP?

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.513
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IN ORGANIZED

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:16.084
WELCOME.

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:18.453
THE PENITENT CLERGY PRIVILEGE IS

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.956
VERY NARROW IT'S WHEN SOMEONE.

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:24.159
GOES TO A MINISTER IN PRIVATE

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.527
FOR PENITENTIAL PURPOSES

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.030
COMMUNICATES IN CONFESSES THAT

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.531
IT IS NOT DEALING WITH

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.934
ECCLESIASTICAL BOARDS FOR

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.335
EXAMPLE WHEN A PRIEST.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:36.338
GOES BEFORE A A TRIBUNAL OF HIS

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:40.175
OWN -- DENOMINATION -- THAT THAT

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.177

STATE'S -- AS THE FORMER --

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.146
KATHY CONFERENCE DIRECTOR FOR

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.714
THE STATE OF TEXAS -- I DIDN'T

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.483

THE STATE THE ONLY STATE THAT I

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.794

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:07.496
PROTECTION IS TEXAS IT NEVER

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:08.130
HAPPENS.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:11.500
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING -- AT

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:12.801
LEAST THE TIME THAT I LIVED IN

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.569
TEXAS THAT THAT -- THE

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:15.938

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:23.779
OF HOW THE PENITENTIAL

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.647
PROTECTION WORKS.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.650
IS BY ITS VERY NATURE PEOPLE ARE

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:32.254
ATTRACTED -- TO THE THE

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.355
RELIGIOUS.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.724

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:39.394
MINISTERS THE RABBIS -- I HAVE A

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.330
FEELING OF TRUST.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:44.232

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.401
UP THERE UP THEIR FAILURES WITH

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:47.469
THOSE FOLKS.

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:53.208
THE INTENT IS TO HAVE A BETTER

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.343
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.878
IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IN A A

01:16:56.945 --> 01:17:00.682
PRIEST WERE -- TO REPORT.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.617

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.219
AUTHORITIES.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.721
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD THEN

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:06.621
USE THE PENITENTIAL

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.023
COMMUNICATION TO SHARE THEIR

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.491
FEELINGS ANY LONGER -- IT WOULD

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.493
BE GONE.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.427

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:15.063
POINT OUT WITHIN THE CATHOLIC

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.265
STRUCTURE -- EVEN IF THIS BILL

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.501
WERE TO PASS PRIEST WOULD NOT BE

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.570
ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND REVEAL

WHAT WAS.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.672
STATED IN THE PENITENTIAL

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.643
THE RULES OF CANON LAW WHICH

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.045

REFERENCE THAT BY.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.870
THIS SILENCE IS WHAT HAS ALLOWED

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.038
CHILDREN TO CONTINUE TO BE

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:57.506
ABUSED BUT I REALLY SHOULD NOT

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.007
ABUSE CHILDREN ALONE.

AND WE SEE THAT IN POWERFUL

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.620
INSTITUTIONS.

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:13.288
THAT UNFORTUNATELY.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.991
NOT ALL BUT MANY ARE.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.260

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:25.233
ABUSERS.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.402
THAT THE ENTITIES PROTECT

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.538
THEMSELVES SO WE SEE IT AGAIN

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:30.906
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WHETHER IT

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.007

INDUSTRY.

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.719
WHERE?

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:47.989
UNTIL WE HAVE HAD LAWS TO MAKE

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.592
IT SAFE.

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.194
FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED TO REPORT

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.564

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.399
CONSEQUENCE YOU KNOW MINIMAL

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.067
CONSEQUENCES TO THEMSELVES THAT

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.770
THESE THE SILENCE CONTINUES THE

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:02.537
ABUSE.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.973
AND WE SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN

LAWS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ABUSERS

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.854
AND TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.387
POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO COME

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:22.958

MANDATORY REPORTERS WHICH I

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.099
THINK IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.334
AT THIS TIME.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.870
GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT.

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:38.540
THE PREVALENCE OF ABUSE WITHIN

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.175
THESE RELIGIOUS SETTINGS.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:42.944
AND THAT FOR US NOT TO WOULD BE

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:48.517
PUTTING OUR HEAD IN THE SAND --

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.153

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.334
THE FIRST TIME.

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.502
IT DOES GET EASIER TO SPEAK

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:13.208
ABOUT IT -- BUT IT NEVER FIFTY

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.110
EXPERIENCES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.314
BUT IT DOES GET EASIER TO SPEAK

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.882
ABOUT IT AND IT'S HEALING.

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:23.685

MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.147
THAT IS A ONE OF THE WITNESSES

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.381
IN OPPOSITION STATED THAT THE

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.050
YO KNOW A PERSON GOING TO THE

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.284
CHURCH -- OF GOING INTO A

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.919
CONFESSIONAL OR HAVING THAT

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.487
COMMUNICATION NOW WON'T.

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:01.122
BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- BUT I

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.190
THINK WITH THE HEAD IN THE SAND

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:02.757
IS.

THEY WILL HAVE TO REPORT THAT IN

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.007
THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.141
WHERE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:23.411
AND IN RELATED TO TEXAS ACTUALLY

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:27.048
ON THE THE CATHOLIC -- DISS --

WEBSITE IT CLEARLY STATES THAT --

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:35.290
TEXAS -- LAW DOES NOT -- VALUE

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.058
DOES NOT -- TO RESPECT THE

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.561
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PENITENTS --

THAT SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED IN

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:50.223
THE WAY WE MAKE THE WAY TO

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.460

BECAUSE THIS MAKES AN INFRACTION

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:25.125
A MISDEMEANOR.

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:27.527
SO IT RAISES THE CONSEQUENCES AS

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:30.063
WE ALL KNOW MISDEMEANORS HAVE A

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:32.199
VARIETY OF COLLATERAL --

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:34.067
CONSEQUENCES TO INCLUDE

RURAL.

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.216
AREAS LARGELY PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.784
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:53.320
FACE THE MOST CONSEQUENCES IN

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:55.088
ERMS OF RAISING THIS FROM AN

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:57.524
INFRACTION. TO A MISDEMEANOR.

01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:59.426
COUNTY JAIL COST SOMEWHERE

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:01.728
AROUND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.663
DOLLARS A YEAR TO HOUSE AN

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:03.664
INMATE.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.399
THAT'S JUST SLIGHTLY LESS THAN

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:08.268
IT WOULD COST TO SEND SOMEONE TO

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.536
STANFORD OR HARVARD.

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:11.104
THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE THIS A

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:15.475
MISDEMEANOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:17.978
PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE GIVEN

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:19.613
THEIR PERMISSION FOR THIS

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.282
DUMPING THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:23.684
DISCOURAGE THIS.

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:25.385
THEN TO SPEND THE TAXPAYERS'

01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:28.588
MONEY PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL AND

THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE AND

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.737
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TEST

01:45:43.804 --> 01:45:46.339
BEFORE -- NINE I WOULD ECHO MY

COLLEAGUES COMMENTS.

01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:50.510
ON AN AD A COUPLE ADDITIONAL

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:52.713
POINTS ON FIRST WE THINK THAT

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:55.182
THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY -- IT

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.751
IS ALREADY UNLAWFUL TO TRANSPORT

01:45:57.818 --> 01:45:59.720
THESE MATERIALS FOR THE PURPOSE

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.021
OF DUMPING THEM ON PRIVATE

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.756
PROPERTY WITHOUT THE OWNER'S

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:03.724
CONSENT.

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.726
SO LONG AS A PERSON TRANSPORTING

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:07.661
THESE MATERIALS HAS THE SPECIFIC

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.896
INTENT TO COMMIT THE CRIME THE

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.832
PERSON CAN ALREADY BE CONVICTED

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:13.366
OF ATTEMPTED DUMPING UNDER

01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:14.568
CURRENT LAW.

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:16.203
IF A PERSON TRANSPORTING THESE

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:18.238
MATERIALS DOES NOT POSSESS THE

01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:20.440
SPECIFIC INTENT TO DUMP THEM.

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.008
THEN THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:24.311
GUILTY OF A CRIME WHETHER AS AN

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.912
ATTEMPT UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:29.483
OR AS A NEW CRIME UNDER SB --

01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:30.484
NINE ON SECOND UP WHILE THE GOAL

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:32.486
OF ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SEEK

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:34.855
APPROPRIATE PERMITS AND LICENSES

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.523
TO DEPOSIT THESE MATERIALS ON

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.291
PRIVATE PROPERTY.

01:46:38.358 --> 01:46:40.427
IS WORTHWHILE FAILURE TO DO SO

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:42.863
DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:43.296
CRIME.

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:44.965
SUCH FAILURES ARE MORE

01:46:45.031 --> 01:46:46.233
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED TO

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.968
PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS AND

01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:50.604
ALREADY ARE UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.539
AND LASTLY CRIMINALIZING BOTH

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:54.007
THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE

PERSON WHO DEPOSITS THE

01:46:55.976 --> 01:46:58.178

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:04.017
AND MAY NOT KNOW WHETHER A

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:06.119
PERMIT OR LICENSE ONCE PROPERLY

01:47:06.186 --> 01:47:08.054
OBTAINED WILL NOT ACTUALLY

ADDRESS OR TO TURN THE BEHAVIOR

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:11.792
CONTEMPLATED BY THE SPELL.

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.894
INSTEAD THE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.797
AN INCREASE MANDATORY FINDS MADE

01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:18.298
NEEDLESSLY FALL ON WELL

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:20.066
INTENTIONED PROPERTY OWNERS AN

CANNOT AFFORD THE FINES.

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.505
AND WHOSE INABILITY TO PAY THESE

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:26.439
FINES WILL HAVE LASTING

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:28.441
CONSEQUENCES ON THEIR LIVES AND

01:47:28.508 --> 01:47:30.076
THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. FOR

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:34.147
THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY

AND WHAT I ASSUMED IN READING

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:49.496
THE ANALYSIS AND THE BILL WAS

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:50.630
THAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:52.632
THESE THESE COMPANIES WITH BIG

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:53.333
TRUCKS THAT ARE DOWN THE

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.734
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE PICTURES

01:47:58.138 --> 01:48:03.810
YOU KNOW MY QUESTION REALLY IS.

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:05.245
IF THE CURRENT SOLUTION OF

PENALIZING A TO THE BIG

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.248

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.751
MOVING IT FROM ONE CATEGORY.

01:48:11.818 --> 01:48:13.453
OF A CRIME TO ANOTHER IT WILL

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.488
MAKE THAT SIGNIFICANT A

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:17.324
DIFFERENCE SO IN THE SECOND

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:18.725
QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH --

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:20.093
OPPOSITION SAID THE PEOPLE HAVE

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.929
PERMISSION TO DUMP.

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:24.798
ON PRIVATE LAND BUT I'M ASSUMING

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:28.869
LAKE LOS ANGELES'S AND PRIVATE

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:31.071
LAND ROB SOMEBODY IS HAPPENING.

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.239
GREAT -- BOTH A GREAT QUESTION

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:33.673
SO SOME TERMS OF THE BILL SO --

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.808
THIS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:36.009
EVERYWHERE IT'S A BIG ISSUE MY

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:37.510
DISTRICT I AS YOU I'M SURE

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:39.179
YOU'RE WHERE RECENTLY THE LA

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:41.214
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAID

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:42.782
THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THEM.

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:47.954
THERE ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT-REACHED OUT THE WANTING IT.

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:49.589
TO YEAH IT DIDN'T TO DO THIS AS

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:50.757
WELL AS LA DA'S OFFICE WHO

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.926
ACTUALLY WROTE THIS -- WE STILL

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:55.195
HAVE A SUPPORT LETTER FROM THEM --

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:56.062
I'M.

01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:57.797
SO IT I DON'T TAKE PRIDE OF

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:59.032
AUTHORSHIP IN TERMS OF THAT IF

01:48:59.099 --> 01:48:59.900
THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:02.135
ENHANCE PENALTIES BUT IT'S LESS

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:03.136
THAN THAN THE MISTER MEAN I'M

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:05.071
FINE WITH THAT WE JUST WANNA PUT

ENOUGH ECONOMIC IN.

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:11.678
DISINCENTIVE IN THERE.

01:49:11.745 --> 01:49:15.548
THE LIKELIHOOD -- SO I MEAN SO

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.250
THAT'S IT SO THESE MOST OF THESE

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:18.151
ARE THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL COPY

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:19.119
BECAUSE THE TIPPING FEES HAVE

01:49:19.185 --> 01:49:19.486
GONE UP IN LA.

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.420
SO THESE ARE MOSTLY PROFESSIONAL

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.155
COMPANIES ARE COMING AND IN

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:23.290

CONTRACTORS IS NOT ALWAYS THE

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:34.901
BIG COMPANY.

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:37.570
SO I AS WE TRY TO SUPPORT SMALL

01:49:37.637 --> 01:49:38.171

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:40.674
OTHER PRESSURES THAT INDEPENDENT

TRUCK DRIVERS ARE EXPERIENCING.

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:43.843
THIS WILL PUT THAT ON THE TABLE

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.045

BUT THEY DID IT THEY WERE

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.318

AND IT'S NOT SANCTIONED.

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:00.694
IT SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T BE

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.262

DON'T LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:08.668
BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD THEY

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.135

EVEN WHERE THE COURT CONCLUDES

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:20.927

INCARCERATED IN OUR PRISONS --

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:36.194
AND MOST OF THEM DO NOT HAVE THE

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:37.229
RIGHT TO POST CONVICTION

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:40.165

THE POST CONVICTION REVIEW

02:15:41.299 --> 02:15:43.368
PROCESS IS INEFFICIENT --

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:45.470
SOMETIMES INCOMPLETE AND

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:48.740
SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE -- WHEN TEN

THE INNOCENCE MOVEMENTS AND WE

OUR DOORS HAD JUST OPENED -- AND

REVEALED THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:06.992
CONVICTED OF FALSE EVIDENCE OR

02:16:07.058 --> 02:16:08.927
FABRICATED EVIDENCE AND SO THAT

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:10.395
LED TO THE BIRTH OF TEN FIFTY

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:11.296
FOUR POINT NINE BUT THE RIGHT

02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:14.132

REVEALED TO US IN THE INFANT

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.473

IN THE DECADES OR EVEN HUNDREDS

02:16:29.481 --> 02:16:31.449

LAST YEAR WENT THROUGH IN A FORM

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.641
IN WHICH THESE TYPES OF

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.109

AND IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:28.593
CONCERN OF ALL OF OURS -- BUT

02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:30.628
OUR ABILITY TO PUT OURSELVES IN

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:46.390
THESE FUNDS TO BE USED IN A LOT

02:37:46.456 --> 02:37:48.258
OF OTHER WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:51.195
ACTUALLY THE TWENTY FIFTEEN

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.062
TWENTY SIXTEEN IWF REPORT FROM

THE EXPENDITURES FROM THE IWF

NOW I KNOW THE OPPOSITION'S

02:38:10.781 --> 02:38:12.282
POSITION IS THAT THIS BILL MAY

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:13.784
ACTUALLY HARM INCARCERATED

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:15.185
PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS BECAUSE

02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:16.687
IT'S GOING TO REMOVE FUNDS.

02:38:16.753 --> 02:38:18.589

INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- BUT AGAIN

02:38:21.592 --> 02:38:23.627
IT'S OUR POSITION THAT IT'S ALSO

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:24.795
NOT APPROPRIATE.

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:26.797
OR FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

02:38:26.864 --> 02:38:29.066

PEOPLE AT LEAST ABLE TO PAY THEM

02:38:31.568 --> 02:38:32.769
AND THAT IT ACTUALLY.

02:38:32.836 --> 02:38:34.404
HARMS PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT

02:38:34.471 --> 02:38:36.039
FRACTURES RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

02:38:42.246 --> 02:38:43.614
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO CHANGE THE

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:52.589
IMPORTANT.

02:38:52.656 --> 02:38:53.991

02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:28.712
AN EIN THE OTHER COMMENT I WOULD

02:46:28.778 --> 02:46:31.614

ARE LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS --

02:46:35.285 --> 02:46:37.954
FIND BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE VERY

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:38.955
LOW INCOME.

02:46:39.022 --> 02:46:40.657
FOLKS BEING HELD IN OUR JAILS

02:46:40.724 --> 02:46:42.125
AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:46:42.192 --> 02:46:42.926
PROVIDE FOR THEM.

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:45.428
MOST EVERYONE HELD IN OUR JAILS

02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:47.697
IS LOW INCOME.

02:46:47.764 --> 02:46:49.966
SO WHO ARE WHO WE CHARGING SOME

02:46:50.033 --> 02:46:52.435
TO THEN GIVE A FEW PENNIES TO

02:46:52.502 --> 02:46:52.669
OTHERS.

02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:54.571
I MEAN WE WE NEED TO GET PAST

02:46:54.637 --> 02:46:55.405
THAT [inaudible]

02:46:55.472 --> 02:46:58.842
AND THE I DON'T HAVE THE DATA

02:46:58.908 --> 02:47:00.443
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME

02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:00.744
[inaudible]

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:03.880
BUT PAST VAST MAJORITY.

02:47:03.947 --> 02:47:05.815
OF THE FOLKS HELD IN OUR COUNTY

02:47:05.882 --> 02:47:08.685
JAILS ARE LOW INCOME SO.

02:47:08.752 --> 02:47:10.787
TO THINK THAT WE WOULD USE THE

02:47:10.854 --> 02:47:12.555
CHARGES TO A FEW.

02:47:12.622 --> 02:47:14.090
AS THE WAY TOO AND THEN FIND

02:47:14.157 --> 02:47:15.859
SOME OTHERS IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:17.394
SENSE I KNOW IT HAS BEEN THE

02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:19.462
PRACTICE I APPRECIATE THAT BUT

02:47:19.529 --> 02:47:20.797
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

02:47:20.864 --> 02:47:22.599
SO I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:47:22.665 --> 02:47:24.100
THINGS WITH AN S. WE HAVE TO

02:47:24.167 --> 02:47:25.902
REFORM AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.137
SKYPE.

02:47:27.203 --> 02:47:30.073
YES THERE'S SOME MONEY -- TO GET

02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:31.474
SOME SCREENS BUT SKYPE ITSELF

02:47:31.541 --> 02:47:32.942
DOESN'T CHARGE I KNOW EVERY

02:47:33.009 --> 02:47:34.411
COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES GOT

02:47:34.477 --> 02:47:35.845
INTERNET ACCESS THEY WOULDN'T

02:47:35.912 --> 02:47:37.480
OPERATE WITHOUT IT.

02:47:37.547 --> 02:47:40.950
SO TO TO CHARGE MUCH FOR THAT.

02:47:41.017 --> 02:47:43.753
IS JUST PATENTLY ABSURD IN MY

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.755
OPINION SO.

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:48.191
I FEEL THIS IS A IMPORTANT STEP

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:49.959
I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO GO A LOT

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:51.961
FURTHER BUT I CERTAINLY AM NOT

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:54.297

WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE.

02:48:29.065 --> 02:48:30.500
WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY AND I

ITEMS THAT DON'T BENEFIT.

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:58.194
THE PRISONERS SUCH AS A VANS AND

02:48:58.261 --> 02:48:59.863
THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO IT

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:02.131
DOESN'T COST AS MUCH FOR PHONE

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:04.601
CALLS AND AS ARCHER ONE STATED

02:49:04.667 --> 02:49:06.836
TECHNOLOGIES REALLY GERMAN DOWN

02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:10.006
THE COST SO -- IT'S IT MAKES NO

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:10.773
SENSE TO ME SO.

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:15.979
I TRULY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:17.680
LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION MOLD.

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:18.481
THE MOTION CENTER JACKSON IS

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:20.216
THANK YOU YOU KNOW IT STRIKES ME

02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:22.352
TOO THAT -- IF THE GOAL OR NOT

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:23.453
IF THE GOAL THAT THE GOAL THERE

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.022
WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHEN IT

02:49:26.089 --> 02:49:27.857
COMES TO INCARCERATION IS

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:30.326
REHABILITATION AND RE ENTRY.

02:49:30.393 --> 02:49:31.928
AND KEEPING PEOPLE FROM THEIR

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:34.464
FAMILIES SEEMS TO ME TO BE SORT

02:49:34.531 --> 02:49:36.065
OF BACKWARDS WAY OF TRYING TO

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:37.967
GET TO A RESULT THAT IS SO

02:49:38.034 --> 02:49:39.369
IMPORTANT.

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:41.204
THE NOTION THAT PETE THAT THESE

02:49:41.271 --> 02:49:42.472
CHARGES ARE BEING MADE THERE

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:46.576
THAT THEY'RE JUST -- RIDICULOUS

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:48.912
AND I HI I THINK THAT IT'S TIME

02:49:48.978 --> 02:49:50.313
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:52.448
INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM STARTED

02:49:52.515 --> 02:49:55.418
ASKING ITSELF WHAT DO WE NEED TO

02:49:55.485 --> 02:49:57.620
DO. TO ASSURE THAT THESE PEOPLE

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:58.922
DON'T COME BACK.

02:49:58.988 --> 02:50:00.523
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:01.491
IS TO TRY TO HELP THEM

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:03.092
STRENGTHENED THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

02:50:03.159 --> 02:50:04.427
WITH THEIR FAMILY AND CERTAINLY

02:50:04.494 --> 02:50:06.262
WOMEN'S STRENGTH IN THEIR

02:50:06.329 --> 02:50:06.863
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:07.730
CHILDREN.

02:50:07.797 --> 02:50:10.733
SO WHETHER OR NOT IT TAKES AWAY

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.369
A FEW DOLLARS FROM SOME PROGRAM

02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:17.807
THAT ARGUABLY ASSIST -- INMATES --

02:50:17.874 --> 02:50:19.709
IF WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT

02:50:19.776 --> 02:50:21.144
THE NEEDS ARE OF THESE PEOPLE AS

02:50:21.210 --> 02:50:22.612
HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT THEY DON'T

02:50:22.679 --> 02:50:23.780
COME BACK.

02:50:23.846 --> 02:50:25.381
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

02:50:25.448 --> 02:50:27.183
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW.

02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:28.885
THERE ARE OTHER STATES SOME OF

02:50:28.952 --> 02:50:30.386
THE RED STATES THAT ARE WAY

02:50:30.453 --> 02:50:31.854
AHEAD OF US ON THIS AND

02:50:31.921 --> 02:50:33.489
CERTAINLY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:35.725
RECOGNIZE THE NEED -- TO FOR RE

02:50:35.792 --> 02:50:38.561
ENTRY IN REHABILITATION AND TO

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:40.063
STRENGTHEN THE BOND AT THESE.

02:50:40.129 --> 02:50:42.198
INMATES HAVE WITH THEIR FAMILY

02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:44.233
SO THEY DON'T RECIDIVIST.

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:45.802
THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR GOAL THE

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:48.471
FACT WHICH CHARGING SEVENTEEN

02:50:48.538 --> 02:50:49.706
DOLLARS FOR PHONE CALL.

02:50:49.772 --> 02:50:54.177
A IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS I MEAN.

02:50:54.243 --> 02:50:54.444
IT TOOK.

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:55.278
I REMEMBER BEING IN COLLEGE BACK

02:50:55.345 --> 02:50:57.313
IN THE DAYS OF PAY PHONES AND I

02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:58.715
AT THE CALL HOME ONCE A WEEK.

02:50:58.781 --> 02:51:00.383
THAT WAS THE RULES.

02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:03.419
AND AND I DID AND YOU KNOW IT'S

02:51:03.486 --> 02:51:05.855
MUCH IS WHEN YOU'RE AWAY YOU

02:51:05.922 --> 02:51:07.490
THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT.

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:08.491
THE PARENTS OF DOWN THAT ARE

02:51:08.558 --> 02:51:10.360
GOOD OR BAD OR WHAT HAVE YOU

02:51:10.426 --> 02:51:12.161
MAKING THAT CONNECTION EVEN JUST

02:51:12.228 --> 02:51:14.263
ONCE A WEEK WAS REALLY HELPFUL

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:16.265
AND MAINTAINING A RELATIONSHIP

02:51:16.332 --> 02:51:17.433
AND I WAS ONLY IN COLLEGE NOT

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:19.736
AND IN JAIL.

02:51:19.802 --> 02:51:22.472
SO -- I JUST THINK THAT WE'VE

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:24.540
WE'VE JUST BEEN WRONG HEADED AND

02:51:24.607 --> 02:51:26.175
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WRONG

02:51:26.242 --> 02:51:27.610
HEADEDNESS SO I WOULD HOPE.

02:51:27.677 --> 02:51:28.711

02:52:48.391 --> 02:52:50.426

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:53.029
ONE NUMBER -- TWO AS MADAM CHAIR

02:52:53.096 --> 02:52:55.098
SUBSCRIBE IT'S FREE AS WE'VE HAD

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:56.733
CONVERSATIONS SPECIFICALLY WITH

02:52:56.799 --> 02:52:58.501
CDC OUR WISH IT WAS SKYPE THAT

02:52:58.568 --> 02:52:59.936
WAS AVAILABLE I DON'T THINK IT

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:00.770
WAS SKY.

02:53:00.837 --> 02:53:03.039
IT'S PRIVATE COMPANIES TO OFFER

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:05.007
THIS SERVICE AND I APPRECIATE

02:53:05.074 --> 02:53:06.642
THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT MAKES IT

02:53:06.709 --> 02:53:09.245
EASIER -- FOR PEOPLE TO VISIT

02:53:09.312 --> 02:53:12.014
AND WE HEARD TESTIMONY IN THE

02:53:12.081 --> 02:53:14.784
VISITATION -- ON THE VISITATION

02:53:14.851 --> 02:53:17.587
BILLS ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS

02:53:17.653 --> 02:53:19.756
WHO MAY NOT LIVE IN AREAS OR

02:53:19.822 --> 02:53:22.225
HAVE A HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND

02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:24.894
SO THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS IS

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.562
NOT CONSIDERED IN THIS FACTOR.

02:53:26.629 --> 02:53:29.632
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST

02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:30.199
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:31.868
AWARE OF WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT

02:53:31.934 --> 02:53:32.702

02:53:38.941 --> 02:53:39.175
[inaudible]

02:53:39.242 --> 02:53:41.043
INMATES.

02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:42.645
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

02:53:42.712 --> 02:53:43.846
THE QUESTION AROUND

02:53:43.913 --> 02:53:45.982
AFFORDABILITY -- I LISTED YOU

02:53:46.048 --> 02:53:47.216
KNOW SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE

02:53:47.283 --> 02:53:48.985
THINGS THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:50.386
STATUTES SUGGESTS IT'S

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:52.288
APPROPRIATE THE IN MUCH THE

02:53:52.355 --> 02:53:55.258
INMATE FUND PAY FOR WE'VE HAD A

02:53:55.324 --> 02:53:58.161
YEARS OF CONVERSATION AT THE CDC

02:53:58.227 --> 02:53:58.861
ARE LEVEL.

02:53:58.928 --> 02:54:00.329
REALLY TRYING TO EVEN TRACK TO

02:54:00.396 --> 02:54:02.031
FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE

02:54:02.098 --> 02:54:04.133
ACCOUNTED FOR THAT HAS BEEN

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.635
SHADY FOR DECADES.

02:54:05.701 --> 02:54:06.803
AND SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING

02:54:06.869 --> 02:54:09.338
TO SAY IS WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:10.907
OFFERED FOR FREE.

02:54:10.973 --> 02:54:12.108
BUT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY WE

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:13.409
CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IT'S MORE

02:54:13.476 --> 02:54:15.678
AND MORE AFFORDABLE WE CERTAINLY

02:54:15.745 --> 02:54:17.847
DON'T EXPECT THE COMMISSION'S BE

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:18.047
MADE.

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:20.049
THAT COUNTY SHOULD PROFIT OR

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:22.485
BENEFIT FROM SIGNING A CONTRACT

02:54:22.552 --> 02:54:23.553
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S APPROPRIATE

02:54:23.619 --> 02:54:25.054
ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTACROSS

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:26.222
THE BOARD.

02:54:26.289 --> 02:54:27.223
WE DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:28.858
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:30.259
COMMISSIONS PAID LEASE SIGN

CONTRACTS FOR VENDORS FOR STATE

02:54:32.695 --> 02:54:33.963
SERVICES SO IT'S CERTAINLY

02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:38.000
SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AT

02:54:38.067 --> 02:54:39.402
THE COUNTY LEVEL.

02:54:39.468 --> 02:54:41.170
WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING THAT.

02:54:41.237 --> 02:54:43.206
INMATES IN COUNTY FACILITIES BE

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:44.440
GIVEN SOME OF THE SAME

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:45.575
PROTECTIONS WE HAVE THROUGH THE

02:54:45.641 --> 02:54:47.844
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FOR INMATES

COSTS OF PHONE CALLS.

02:54:51.781 --> 02:54:54.317
THE COST OF INTERNET ACCESS

02:54:54.383 --> 02:54:58.721
PARTICULARLY SINCE -- OPPOSITION

02:54:58.788 --> 02:55:00.056

02:55:07.163 --> 02:55:08.931
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:10.199
SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE IN PERSON

BUT WE NOW HAVE SOME LAWS ON OUR

02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:54.597
STATE BOOKS.

02:57:54.663 --> 02:57:56.565
THAT.

02:57:56.632 --> 02:57:59.168
IN PRACTICE SHRINK THE JURY POOL

02:57:59.235 --> 02:58:01.103
AND STOP JURIES FROM BEING

02:58:01.170 --> 02:58:03.305
REPRESENTATIVE FOR EXAMPLE

02:58:03.372 --> 02:58:05.107
PEOPLE WITH A FELONY CONVICTION

02:58:05.174 --> 02:58:06.909
A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION CANNOT

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:09.478
SERVE ON JURIES.

02:58:09.545 --> 02:58:10.546
YOU CAN GET A FELONY.

02:58:10.613 --> 02:58:12.982
FROM [inaudible]

02:58:13.049 --> 02:58:17.319
GRAFFITI. FOR FROM IT DRUG

02:58:17.386 --> 02:58:18.788
OFFENSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A PAST

02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:20.423
ADDICTION [inaudible]

02:58:20.489 --> 02:58:21.857
THERE ARE.

02:58:21.924 --> 02:58:23.793
MEN MANY CASES WHERE THERE ARE

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:25.728
FELONY CONVICTIONS AND YET YOU

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:27.063
CAN HAVE A PERSON.

02:58:27.129 --> 02:58:29.131
WHO IS BàN?

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:30.433
CRIME FREE.

02:58:30.499 --> 02:58:33.002
LIVING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY

02:58:33.069 --> 02:58:34.437
SUCCESSFULLY FOR DECADES AND YET

02:58:34.503 --> 02:58:36.172
STILL THEY CANNOT SERVE ON A

02:58:36.238 --> 02:58:37.873
JURY.

02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:38.774
THIS OF COURSE

02:58:38.841 --> 02:58:40.509
DISPROPORTIONATELY EXCLUDES

02:58:40.576 --> 02:58:43.379
PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM JURIES.

02:58:43.446 --> 02:58:45.581
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A STATISTIC

02:58:45.648 --> 02:58:47.616
IN.

02:58:47.683 --> 02:58:48.951
TWENTY SIXTEEN WITHIN CALIFORNIA

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:51.654
STATE PRISON POPULATIONS WHILE

02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:53.155
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE

02:58:53.222 --> 02:58:54.557
POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IS A

02:58:54.623 --> 02:58:56.225
WHOLE ARE ONLY 6% OF THE

02:58:56.292 --> 02:59:00.796
POPULATION. 30% OF THE MEN IN

02:59:00.863 --> 02:59:02.898
STATE PRISONS WERE BLACK.

02:59:02.965 --> 02:59:04.633
SO WHAT SB THREE TEN DOES IS

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:05.868
CORRECT THAT.

02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:07.803
IT WIDENS THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE

02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:10.039
JURORS BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:11.740
PAST FELONY CONVICTIONS TO SERVE

02:59:11.807 --> 02:59:13.142
ON A JURY.

02:59:13.209 --> 02:59:15.177
IT ALSO EXPANDS THE LIST THAT

02:59:15.244 --> 02:59:17.446
CAN BE USED TO SELECT JURIES TO

02:59:17.513 --> 02:59:20.416
INCLUDE UTILITY RATE PAYERS AND

02:59:20.483 --> 02:59:22.384
STATE TAX FILERS.

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:23.886
BECAUSE WE ARE HERE FOR MANY

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:28.057
COURTS THAT THE HAVE DIFFICULTY --

02:59:28.124 --> 02:59:29.992
GETTING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO SHOW UP

02:59:30.059 --> 02:59:31.560
FOR JURY DUTY AND PART OF IT IS

02:59:31.627 --> 02:59:32.361
BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY

02:59:32.428 --> 02:59:34.663
RESTRICTED SET OF LISTS THAT WE

02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:37.366
USE. TO POLL FOR JURORS SO THIS

02:59:37.433 --> 02:59:39.068
IS TO EXPAND THAT.

02:59:39.135 --> 02:59:41.337
AND IT ALSO REMOVES PRESUMPTION

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:43.606
THAT THE LIST USED FOR THE THE

02:59:43.672 --> 02:59:45.674
LIST USED FOR JURY SELECTION IS

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:48.077
A FAIR CROSS SECTION OF THE

02:59:48.144 --> 02:59:49.478
POPULATION.

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:51.780
NO JUST -- FOR FOLKS THAT MAY BE

02:59:51.847 --> 02:59:53.516
THINKING ALRIGHT WHY.

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:55.551
WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIA -- MOVE IN

02:59:55.618 --> 02:59:57.419
THIS DIRECTION OF ALLOWING A

02:59:57.486 --> 02:59:59.255
FORMER FELL AND TO SERVE ON A

02:59:59.321 --> 03:00:01.223
JURY WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS THERE

03:00:01.290 --> 03:00:03.159
ARE MANY STATES THAT DO SO

03:00:03.225 --> 03:00:06.262
COLORADO ILLINOIS MAINE OREGON

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:08.797

I'VE BEEN WITH THE ALBANY COUNTY

PUBLIC FUNDS UP TO TWENTY THREE

03:00:32.888 --> 03:00:33.789
YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF

AND I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU

03:00:37.526 --> 03:00:38.794
HOW OFTEN I'VE SAID AT COUNSEL

03:00:38.861 --> 03:00:40.462
TABLE WITH SOME YOUNG AFRICAN

03:00:40.529 --> 03:00:41.931
AMERICAN MALE WHO'S EXCITED TO

03:00:41.997 --> 03:00:43.332
TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL HE'S A

03:00:43.399 --> 03:00:44.767
REALLY.

03:00:44.833 --> 03:00:46.335
ANTICIPATING A TRIAL AND THEN

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:47.937
THE EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:48.504
WALK IN [inaudible]

03:00:48.571 --> 03:00:54.577
AND EXACTLY.

03:00:54.643 --> 03:00:56.545
THAT PERSON THAT YOUNG MAN IS

03:00:56.612 --> 03:00:58.180
COMPLETELY DEFEATED.

03:00:58.247 --> 03:00:59.014
AND I SIT THERE AND I TELL THEM

03:00:59.081 --> 03:00:59.848
YOU KNOW.

03:00:59.915 --> 03:01:01.717
WE WE CAN GET A FAIR JURY TRIAL

03:01:01.784 --> 03:01:02.017
[inaudible]

03:01:02.084 --> 03:01:05.688
AND THAT HAS NO MEANING BECAUSE

03:01:05.754 --> 03:01:07.456
THERE IS NO WE'LL JURY OF HIS

03:01:07.523 --> 03:01:09.625
PEERS THAT EXIST HE LOOKS AROUND.

03:01:09.692 --> 03:01:11.927
AND HE SEES THAT.

03:01:11.994 --> 03:01:13.696
NO ONE WHO WILL BE SITTING IN

03:01:13.762 --> 03:01:16.065
JUDGMENT OF HIM LOOKS LIKE HIM.

03:01:16.131 --> 03:01:19.301
SO SB THREE TEN IS A STEP IN THE

03:01:19.368 --> 03:01:19.868
RIGHT DIRECTION TO FIX THAT

03:01:19.935 --> 03:01:21.370
PROBLEM.

03:01:21.437 --> 03:01:23.272
THEIR CURRENT RACIAL DISPARITIES

03:01:23.339 --> 03:01:23.806
THAT EXIST IN OUR CRIMINAL

03:01:23.872 --> 03:01:25.074
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:26.942
EXCLUDING PEOPLE FROM SERVING ON

03:01:27.009 --> 03:01:28.510
JURIES BASED ON FELONY

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:30.412
CONVICTIONS JUST EXACERBATES

03:01:30.479 --> 03:01:32.348
THAT RACIAL SEVERITY.

03:01:32.414 --> 03:01:33.449
IN THE SYSTEM AND ALSO

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.584
EXACERBATED MORE SPECIFICALLY IN

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:37.086
THE JURY SYSTEM.

AS YOU'VE HEARD [inaudible] 30%.

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:43.826
30% OF BLACK MEN ARE PREVENTED

03:01:43.892 --> 03:01:46.362
FROM SERVING AS JURORS BASED ON

03:01:46.428 --> 03:01:48.397
THIS EXCLUSION ALONE.

03:01:48.464 --> 03:01:49.765
SO AT IT SAYS RIGHT NOW WE WOULD

03:01:49.832 --> 03:01:51.400
NEVER EVER CONSIDER PUTTING A

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.102
LOT INTO PLACE.

03:01:53.168 --> 03:01:54.770
THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:56.805
THIRTY IN A BLACK MAN.

03:01:56.872 --> 03:01:57.373
THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE

03:01:57.439 --> 03:01:59.241
SYSTEM.

03:01:59.308 --> 03:02:00.709
IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE DO OPEN

03:02:00.776 --> 03:02:01.877
ARMS THEY KNOW WE COULDN'T DO

03:02:01.944 --> 03:02:03.078
THAT EXCLUSION [inaudible]

03:02:03.145 --> 03:02:04.913
SO.

03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:07.116
WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

03:02:07.182 --> 03:02:08.350
IS PRECLUDING OVER THIRTY

CONVICTION FROM CERTAIN INJURIES

03:02:09.985 --> 03:02:11.553
EXCLUDES PEOPLE FROM COLOR.

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:13.489
FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM.

03:02:13.555 --> 03:02:16.158
THAT WILL ACTUALLY.

03:02:16.225 --> 03:02:18.527
IMPOSE THOSE BURDENS THOSE

AND WHAT WE ARE DOING.

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:30.139
THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE DON'T

03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:31.640
VALUE THE EXPERIENCE OF COMMON

03:02:31.707 --> 03:02:34.610

03:10:53.175 --> 03:10:54.376
WHEN YOU SEE FELONY IT'S A BROAD

03:10:54.442 --> 03:10:56.812
CATEGORY -- WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS

03:10:56.878 --> 03:10:58.613
ON THE SEXUAL OFFENDERS LIST AND

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:00.749
IT COULD BE.

03:11:00.816 --> 03:11:02.050
YOU'RE NEEDING OUTDOORS AND

03:11:02.117 --> 03:11:04.019

ACTUALLY DONE SOME WORK ON SOME

03:11:09.591 --> 03:11:11.126
DEGRADATION OF THAT LIST.

03:11:11.193 --> 03:11:12.828
WHICH I SUPPORTED I'M WONDERING

03:11:12.894 --> 03:11:14.830
IS THERE SOME KIND OF

03:11:14.896 --> 03:11:16.097
DEGRADATION WE COULD DO. FOR

03:11:16.164 --> 03:11:18.500
FELONIES SO THAT CERTAIN

03:11:18.567 --> 03:11:20.435
FELONIES ARE ARE FINE.

03:11:20.502 --> 03:11:21.536
MAYBE GOING INCREMENTALLY I

03:11:21.603 --> 03:11:24.372
GUESS IS WHERE I'M ASKING.

03:11:24.439 --> 03:11:25.640
WE CONSIDER THAT.

03:11:25.707 --> 03:11:27.342
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WE

03:11:27.409 --> 03:11:30.011
RESTORED THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

03:11:30.078 --> 03:11:31.146
SO THAT.

03:11:31.213 --> 03:11:33.348
THE PERSON WHO.

03:11:33.415 --> 03:11:36.251
I HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY

03:11:36.318 --> 03:11:38.019
BUT IS NO LONGER INCARCERATED.

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:39.754
CAN VOTE NOW IN CALIFORNIA.

03:11:39.821 --> 03:11:41.957
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND

03:11:42.023 --> 03:11:43.658
WE DID NOT MAKE A TIERED.

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:45.160
WE DO NOT SAY IF YOU HAD THIS

03:11:45.227 --> 03:11:47.963

03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:49.598

03:11:49.664 --> 03:11:52.701
SO I THINK WE'RE WE LOOK AT IT.

03:11:52.767 --> 03:11:54.970
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF IF YOU

03:11:55.036 --> 03:11:57.205

THAT THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR
