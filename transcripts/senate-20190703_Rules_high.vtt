CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.839
EDUCATION -- IT'S A PROPITIOUS

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.173
MOMENT FOR EDUCATION IN THE

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.074
STATE.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.742
MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.743
WAS ONCE ONE OF THE MOST

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.512
IMPRESSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.813
THE COUNTRY AND PERHAPS IN THE

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.416
WORLD -- BUT WE HAD A STEADY

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.052
DECLINE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS --

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.454
WHICH CAUSED ONE FILMMAKER TO

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.089
CREATE A FILM CALLED FROM FIRST

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.058
TO WORST TO CHARACTERIZE --

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.861
CALIFORNIA'S SLIDE -- BY TWO SUB

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:08.461
THOUSAND SEVEN WE WERE IN THE

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.730
BOTTOM FIVE STATES ON DOLLARS

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.065
AND STAFFING AND ACHIEVEMENT.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.600
BUT WE'VE HAD A TURNAROUND IN

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.035
RECENT YEARS AND A NEW FUNDING

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.437
SYSTEM NEW ACCOUNTABILITY

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.305
STANDARDS CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.107
INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTS GAINS IN

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.942
ACHIEVEMENT GAINS IN GRADUATION

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.945
RATES AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.080
CONTINUE THIS PATH AND I'VE

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.681
LOOKED AT A LOT OF STATES AND A

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:29.482
LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.451
REALLY ACHIEVED ACADEMICALLY AND

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.519
THEY HAVE.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.754
A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEAR PERIOD

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.556
OF BUILDING ON SUCCESS AND

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.057
REFINING AND IMPROVING WHAT

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.092
THEY'VE DONE.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.727
A AND I THINK THAT'S THE PATH

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.262
WE'RE ON AT THE STATE BOARD SO I

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.664
HOPE TO CONTRIBUTE. TO THAT PATH

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:49.769
AND TO HELP US A MOVE FROM WORST

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.170
TO FIRST.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:51.771

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.045
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VERY

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.514
DETAILED THE I THINK IT WAS

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.550
YESTERDAY I'M LOSING TRACK OF

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.951
TIME MAYBE WAS THE DAY BEFORE.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.620
ON OUR STATE -- CRITIC EDUCATION

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.056
EFFORTS THE LC FF AN ALLE CAP

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.493
PROCESS AMONG MANY OTHER ISSUES --

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.161

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.999
AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.200
OF LOOK FORWARD.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.969
TO MOVING HER CONFIRMATION -- AT

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.537

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.849
FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION -- WE TOO

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.017
HAD A LOVELY CONVERSATION

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.352
YESTERDAY WHICH I VERY MUCH

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.954
APPRECIATED SOME THIS CALL

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.555
THINGS I WANTED TO GET OUT THERE

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.157
BECAUSE JUST SO YOU CAN

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.559
ARTICULATED SO I'VE HAD A LOT OF

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.061
CONSTITUENT LETTERS.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.496
ON THE RECENT AT HEALTH

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.365
EDUCATION STANDARDS I KNOW WE

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.633
TALKED ABOUT IT IF YOU COULD

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.668
JUST SHARE THE PROCESS AND IN

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.036
THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S IN THERE

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:57.870
SO.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.405
THAT'S OUT IN THE PUBLIC AROUND

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.940
MIGHT APPRECIATE OR YES I THINK

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.343
IT WAS MY SECOND BOARD MEETING

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.445
AT WHICH WE WERE -- PRESENTED

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:05.979
WITH THE HEALTH EDUCATION

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.780
FRAMEWORKS -- AND I THINK

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.282
PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.618
PART OF THE FRAMEWORKS BUT 90%

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.587
OF IT IS NUTRITION AND SAFETY

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.356
AND WHERE YOUR BICYCLE HELMET

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.857
AND SO ON BUT THERE'S ABOUT 10%

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.626
WHICH IS ON SEX EDUCATION WHICH

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.861
IS INTENDED TO HELP DISTRICTS.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.596
IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT WAS

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.099
PASSED SOME YEARS AGO REQUIRING

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.035
SEX EDUCATION AT FIFTH GRADE

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.304
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL --

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.407
THE GUIDANCE IN THE FRAMEWORK IS

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.843
COMPLETELY OPTIONAL IT IS

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.045
COMPLETELY -- UP TO THE

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.314
DISTRICTS -- WHAT THEY USE AND

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.117
FOR PARENTS -- THEY GET A NOTICE

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.885
A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THERE'S

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:51.157
A SEX EDUCATION -- LESSON OR OR

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.025
UNIT OF INSTRUCTION AND THEY CAN

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.459
SEE ALL THE MATERIALS AND CAN

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.628
OPT OUT -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.164
SO -- BUT THESE MATERIALS ARE

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.467
MADE AVAILABLE AS OPTIONS -- FOR

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.770
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.271
MANDATE.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.506
THROUGH THE LAW.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.308
WE GOT A LOT OF PARA COMMENT ON

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.178
THIS SET OF MATERIALS AND AND

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.680
WAS VERY HELPFUL ACTUALLY TO

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.214
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD -- THERE

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.315
WERE SOME RESOURCES THAT WERE

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.851
FLAG THAT WERE REALLY --

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:21.087
CHALLENGING -- FROM THE

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.288
PERSPECTIVE OF MANY PARENTS AND

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.090
BOARD MEMBERS AGREED THAT SOME

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.559
OF THOSE WERE NOT -- IDEAL FOR

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.094
RECOMMENDING TO SCHOOL SO WE

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.696
TOOK SOME OF THEM OUT AS WE

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:31.164
PASSED THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.632
FORWARD WE NOW THINK IT'S A

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.267
USEFUL TOOL BUT IT IS A

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:36.703
COMPLETELY OPTIONAL TOOL. FOR

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.304
DISTRICTS USE.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.940
GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WE

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.442
JUST RECENTLY HAD THE TASK FORCE

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.609
THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOL POLICY

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.944
TASK FORCE RECENTLY CAME OUT

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.845
THEIR REPORT.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.714
WARNING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.149
ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.151
WELL THE CHURCH SCHOOL TASK

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.153
FORCE -- GAVE A LOT OF

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.588
RECOMMENDATIONS A NUMBER OF THEM

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.389
WERE UNANIMOUS AND I THOUGHT

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.924
THAT WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.791
BECAUSE THEY HAD KIND OF

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.393
EVERYONE AT THE TABLE TRYING TO

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.494
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HAVE A

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:01.694
GOOD.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.130
STRONG HEALTHY CHARTER SECTOR

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.065
THAT YOU KNOW ALSO AVOIDS

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.267
CHALLENGES OR ABUSES OF ANY KIND

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.702
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS USEFUL

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.670
THERE WERE.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.638
AGREEMENTS OF I DON'T KNOW IF I

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.373
THERE WAS A LOT OF RECOGNITION

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.041
WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.876
THERE WAS -- SOME AGREEMENT

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.444
ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.012
STRENGTHEN THE CRITERIA AND

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.481
CLARIFY THE CRITERIA FOR

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:22.782
AUTHORIZATION.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.817
RE AUTHORIZATION WAYS THAT WE

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.120
CAN CREATE A STRONGER PROCEDURE

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.455
OF THROUGH THE PROCESSES AT THE

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:30.990
LOCAL LEVEL IN HE STATE LEVEL.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.992
SOME AGREEMENTS THAT I ACTUALLY

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.460
WAS UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:35.995
WHILE THE STATE CURRENTLY DOES

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.164
ACTUALLY OPERATE A SET OF

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.133
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OVERSEAS US

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.067
OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT THAT WAS

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.969
PROBABLY NOT THE IDEAL ROLE FOR

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:43.603
THE STATE ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.504
BE.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.907
A STATE APPEAL OF SOME SORT --

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.509
ONE WE HAVE A SCHOOL APPROVED

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.810
THEY SHOULD BE RUN BY.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.712
A COUNTY OR DISTRICT THAT HAS

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.647
THE APPARATUS TO SUPPORT THEM

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:55.014
WHILE.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:55.915
ALSO I THINK THERE WERE A NUMBER

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.583

ENGLISH LEARNERS AND UNDER THE

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.737
LC FFE.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.672
INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:02.141
MAYBE NOT TO MOVE STUDENTS

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.110
FORWARD SINCE THEY GET A

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:05.711
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AS LONG AS

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.213
THEY'RE AND ENGLISH LEARNER YOU

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.015
SHARED SOME IDEAS WITH ME ON

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.216
THAT THAT I THINK WOULD BE

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.851
VALUABLE TO SHARE WITH THE

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.352
COMMITTEE HOW WE MIGHT.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.254
LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE SURE

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.990
OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.926
REYES WAS -- WHETHER THEIR

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.661
DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS APPLIED

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.329
ACROSS DISTRICTS FOR

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.598
RECLASSIFYING STUDENTS AND HOW

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.099
COULD WE MAKE THOSE MORE

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.302
CONSISTENT AND THEN HOW TO ME

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:31.804
INCENTIVIZE -- RE CLASSIFICATION

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:34.774
WHEN IT'S WARRANTED -- SO ON THE

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.575
FIRST OF THOSE ISSUES WE HAVE

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.811
JUST THE BOARD HAS JUST APPROVED

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.614
A NEW ENGLISH LEARNER ASSESSMENT --

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.950
AND THAT WE THINK OF WILL --

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.351
CREATE A BETTER OF MORE

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.154
CONSISTENT SORT OF EVIDENCE BASE

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.188
ABOUT WHEN.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.790
A LEARNER'S ARE READY TO BE

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.092
RECLASSIFIED -- AND THEN YOU TO

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.060
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.429
WHEN YOU GET A MONEY FOR THE

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.196
NUMBER OF ENGLISH LEARNERS YOU

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:57.964
HAVE.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.265
WHEN THEY BECOME A CLASSIFIED

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.766
AND ARE NO LNGER IN THAT

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:01.968
CATEGORY YOU MIGHT HAVE AN

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:03.703
INCENTIVE NOT? TO LOSE THAT

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.038
MONEY AND WE KNOW THAT QUITE

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.239
OFTEN EVEN AFTER STUDENTS

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.008
REQUEST BY THEY DO NEED SOME

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.677
ONGOING SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.612
SO IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THERE

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.449
TO BE A YEAR OR TWO OF ONGOING

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:20.086
MODEST SUPPORT FOR THAT PROCESS --

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.520
SO THAT STUDENTS AREN'T DROPPED

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:24.357
FROM ANY SERVICES OR SUPPORTS

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.992
AND SO THAT THERE IS.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:32.365
AN INCENTIVE TO RECLASSIFY WHEN-IT'S TIME THANK YOU IN THIS I

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.332
THINK YOU ALSO MENTIONED.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.266
THE ABILITY TO MAYBE.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:34.834
MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT IS

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.002
SUCCESSFUL IN THE TRANSITION

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:39.138
EXACTLY NOT JUST DROPPED OFF.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.139
IN THEN I ALSO ASKED IF OU HAD

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.742
A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD YOU DO

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.310
AND YOU SHARED SOME THOUGHTS

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.945
ABOUT TEACHER TRAINING THAT I

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:46.645
FOUND.

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.381
I YEAH YEAH I I WAS HAPPY TO

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.915
HAVE THAT MAGIC WAND I WOULD

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.784
LIKE TO HOLD ON TO IT IF I COULD

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.719
BUT I THINK IT VANISHES ONCE I

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.654
LEAVE THIS HERE -- BUT I WOULD

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.223
LOVE FOR US TO BUILD NOW THAT

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.924
WE'VE GOT A NEW ACCOUNTABILITY

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.459
SYSTEM STANDARDS CURRICULUM

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:02.428
FRAMEWORKS AND SO ON A SYSTEM OF

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.196
SUPPORT THAT IS A REALLY STRONG

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.097
SYSTEM.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.799
OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.001
TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS -- SO

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.369
THAT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.537
IMPROVE.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.572
SERVICES FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS OR

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.174
MATH INSTRUCTION THERE IS HIGH

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.576
QUALITY READILY AVAILABLE

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.779
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- THAT

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.415
MEETS THE STANDARDS WE KNOW --

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:23.883
SUCCEEDS IN THAT REGARD

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:26.052
SUSTAINED WORK WITH COACHING

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.187
FOLLOW UP NOT ALL OF IT PROVIDED

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.555
BY THE STATE BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.957
MANY PROVIDERS OF SUCH SERVICES.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.959
BUT ORCHESTRATED IN A WAY THAT

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.594
WE CAN SEE WHAT WE HAVE THAT WE

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.229
CAN FILL THE GAPS WE CAN MAKE

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:37.863
SURE THAT.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.965
EDUCATORS WHO WANT TO DO THEIR

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:41.233
BEST WORK ARE NOT.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.435
LOOKING UNDER ROCKS FOR

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.736
KNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW LIKE MAYBE

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.371
I'LL FIND THE ANSWER HERE BUT

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.373
REALLY BUILDING THAT SYSTEM SO

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.874
THAT IT'S READILY AVAILABLE.

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.476
AND WE CAN REALLY IMPROVE

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.777
STUDENT LEARNING.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.112
AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.681
CHALLENGE OFACCESS BASED ON

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.117
GEOGRAPHIC ECONOMIC DIVERSITY

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.885
AROUND THE STATE SOME TEACHERS

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:00.786
MIGHT HAVE.

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:03.422
MORE READY ACCESS TO THAT TYPE

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:04.590
OF SUPPORT AND TRAINING THAN

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.759
OTHERS THAT IS DEFINITELY A CASE.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.995
THAT WE DO HAVE A WORK GOING ON

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.497
TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.232
COUNTIES TO MEET MANY OF THOSE

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.367
NEEDS AND SO ON BUT THERE ARE

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.769
HOLES IN THEIR GAPS IS A LITTLE

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:19.238
SWISS CHEESY RIGHT NOW AND I

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.840
THINK FOR ALL KIDS.

TO GET THE BENEFIT OF GOOD

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:25.978
TEACHING AND LEARNING WE WANTED

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:26.645
TO BE.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.447
MORE LIKE CHEDDAR CHEESE OR

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.448
SOMETHING HOLES.

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:30.082
THANK YOU AND THEN FINALLY WE

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.917
TALK SOME ABOUT THE DASHBOARD IN

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.319
KIND OF A DIVERSITY RIGHT NOW ON

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.987
WHAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.655
ONLINE.

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:37.756
BETWEEN DISTRICTS BETWEEN

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.692

WE'VE WE'VE JUST BEGUN A

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.932
CONVERSATION.

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.135
IN THE STATE BOARD STAFF AND THE

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.370
CD STAFF ABOUT HOW TO BRING

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.105
TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE THE

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.107
VARIOUS KINDS OF DATA THAT ARE

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.009
IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT BECAUSE

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.111
PEOPLE SOMETIMES. TO EVEN DRAW

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.813
DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:03.516
DIFFERENT YEARS AND DIFFERENT

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:04.984
DATA SOURCES AND SO ON AND

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.520
RATIONALIZE THAT MAKE IT.

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:08.687
A PERHAPS THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU GO

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.122
INTO THE DASHBOARD THAT WHEN YOU

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.390
WANT TO KNOW MORE.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.525
ABOUT THE TRENDS IN ENGLISH

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.193
LANGUAGE ARTS ACHIEVEMENT OR

WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU CAN SEE

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.364
THE TRENDS EASILY AND READILY

OTHER RELEVANT -- BENCHMARKS --

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:25.971
SO WE ARE BEGINNING THEIR

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.440
PROCESS TO REALLY SEE FREAKING.

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.675
BUILD ON WHAT'S BEEN DONE WITH A

TIMELINESS STANDARD.

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:10.368
WHEN IT COMES TO BEING FAIR

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.470
