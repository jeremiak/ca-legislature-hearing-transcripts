LAST WEEK ON A RELATED ISSUE BUT

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:40.171
TO EXTENDED NOW IS A PROTECTED

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.506

I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR DOING

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.509
THIS I THINK HOMELESSNESS AMONG

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.177
OUR VETERANS IS A BIG ISSUE.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:49.013
AND I LIKE THE ANECDOTAL

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.616

VETERANS.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:00.191
BUT THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:01.826
OUR VETERANS WITH VOUCHERS IS

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:05.763
CLEAR THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.930

GOOD MORNING AT SENATOR AS YOU

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.173
NOTED THIS IS A RE INTRODUCTION

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.708
OF A BILL THAT WAS VETOED LAST

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:17.842
YEAR.

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.278
BY GOVERNOR BROWN AB.

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.479
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.881
THE CONCERNS THAT HE REYES WHAT

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:25.216
A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR WAS

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.684
CONCERNED IF I REMEMBER

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:27.452
CORRECTLY AND I DON'T REMEMBER

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:28.353
WHETHER HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:30.121
WANT WHICH PART IT WAS -- I

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:33.258
THINK HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:36.060
ISSUE OF OF THE PROTECTED CLASS

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:37.729
THAT WOULD BE CREATED FOR THIS

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:40.865
FOR HOUSING AND I THINK THAT --

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:41.933
AS WE KNOW AND IT'S JUST BEEN

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.702
ARTICULATED VETERANS SHOULD BE

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:45.870
PROTECTED IN HOUSING

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:47.939
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE WE SEE

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.141
EVIDENCE OF THAT AND IT SHOULD

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.377
JUST A BASIC PHILOSOPHICAL

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:52.944
DISAGREEMENT I THINK WE HAVE

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:53.678
WITH THE GOVERNOR.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:54.512
RIGHT AND I THINK THEY ARE THE

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:56.881
OTHER CONCERN THAT HE REYES WAS

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.416
THAT THIS WAY TO COMPILE.

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.518
PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.154
IN A PROGRAM THAT ENCOUNTERING

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.689
CUMBERSOME SO.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:06.557
AND IN THE HOW TO PROGRAM THAT

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:11.529
WE SEE IN THE TO PUT IT INTO

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:12.063
CONTEXT.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.032
IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE A TOTAL

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:17.235
OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BASH BATCH.

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:18.369
IN THE ENTIRE STATE WITH SIX SIX

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.170
MILLION RENTAL UNITS.

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:21.205
THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE IS

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.740
MINIMAL THE BENEFIT IS

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.175
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:25.343
AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT IT

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.111
IN CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE WE

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:29.614
CAN SEE THAT IT'S A IT'S A MINOR.

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.983
PERHAPS INCONVENIENCE AS SOMEONE

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.750
WHO HAS RENTAL PROPERTY.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.953
AND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.188
GO THROUGH WHATEVER IS NECESSARY

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:37.955
AND AND FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.424
IT'S IT'S SPECIFIC TO WHATEVER

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.926
HOUSING AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTY

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:42.493

UP AND MANY HAVE MADE IN

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.698
STREAMLINED THE PROCESS TO THAT

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:47.198
THEY CAN GET THROUGH IT

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.434
EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IT'S NOT A

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.170
BURDEN ON THE LANDLORDS THAT

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:55.306
CORRECT.

AND WORTH -- WORKABLE FOR

00:35:15.112 --> 00:35:16.013
EVERYONE.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.281
THIS IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:18.916
DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA WITH

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:20.952
INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN IT

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.653
COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.788
AND MINORITIES.

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:25.823
YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:26.390
KNOW.

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:29.427
AND WE CAN TALK ANECDOTALLY WE

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:31.996
CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:34.031
OUR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE BUT

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:35.900
NOTHING SUBSTITUTES FOR GOOD

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.435
HARD DATA.

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:39.670
AND THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:41.706
EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:44.141
EMPLOYEES ARE MORE -- WILL BE

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.043
REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A DAY -- PAY

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.778
DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.113
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.982
AND HOUSING OUTLINING THE

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.884
COMPENSATION IN HOURS WORKED OF

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.685
EMPLOYEES BY GENDER.

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:57.922
RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.423
THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.392
FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.728
ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.997
AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION.

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:08.366
I DO NOT THINK OR BELIEVE THAT

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.768
MOST EMPLOYERS INTENTIONALLY

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.804
DISCRIMINATE I THINK THEY DO SO

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:16.541
THROUGH EITHER IMPLICIT BIAS OR

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:18.976
UNCONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING.

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.311
AND I THINK THIS IS AN

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.847
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT A MIRROR IN

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.682
FRONT OF THEIR THESE COMPANIES

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.884
SO THAT THEY CAN SELF EVALUATE

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.452
AND REALIZE THAT IN MANY

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:29.587
INSTANCES.

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.522
THEY ARE INDEED DISCRIMINATING

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:33.891
NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONALLY SO

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.160
THIS IS SORT OF A SOFT TOUCH TO

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:38.429
ALLOW FOR ITSELF CORRECTION.

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:43.234
THE SECOND ASPECT TO THIS.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.302
BILLS GOAL IS TO ALLOW THE

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:44.902
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:47.371
HOUSING TO GATHER IMPORTANT DATA

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:49.574
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.142
OF WAGE DISPARITIES.

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.344
IN IF THEY NOTICE DEVIATIONS

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.613
WORE OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.248
FURTHER SO PERHAPS THIS

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:59.750
DISCRIMINATION IS INTENTIONAL OR

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.619
THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:03.454
AMELIORATE IT TO TO CORRECT IT

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.122
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN YOU ADD

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:06.657
WOMEN AND PEOPLE.

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.292
OF COLOR AND ALL THE COMMUNITIES

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.994
THAT MAKE UP CALIFORNIA

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.662
BUSINESSES DO BETTER.

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:14.265
AND TO THIS WILL IT THIS

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.666
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.535
ALSO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:19.637
STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IF THEY

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:21.038
REQUESTED.

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:22.707
THIS BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.609
AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE DONE AT

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.243
THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.245
RECOGNIZING THAT ON EQUAL PAY IS

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.982
FREQUENTLY HIDDEN FROM VIEW. TO

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.917
BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES THE

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:34.819
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.887
PROPOSED REVISION TO THE

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:39.090
DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.791
EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.194
FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.662
THIS IS THE EMAIL ONE THE

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:47.331
EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT.

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:48.499
THAT HAS BEEN.

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:51.569
A REQUIRED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.842
EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE

00:37:57.908 --> 00:37:59.210
REPORTING A PAY DATA.

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:02.813

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:07.385
STANDING DATA COLLECTION REPORT

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:08.953
THE IDEA WAS THAT THIS DATA

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.088
COULD BE COLLECTED WITH MINIMAL

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.356
DISRUPTION TO EMPLOYERS.

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.959
BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN

IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR A FEDERAL

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.045

ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS.

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.765
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS DECISION

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.434
COULD BE APPEALED AND THIS BILL

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.803
ENSURES THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:00.237

THEY CREATED A VERY VIABLE

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.244

WAY.

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:36.107

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:33.864
CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GENDER AND

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.300
RACIAL WAGE GAP THAT PERSISTS IN

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.635
THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.503

THOROUGH AND COMPREHENSIVE

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.508
PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:46.177
TO COLLECT THIS DATA.

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.411
THE MOST EFFECTIVE DATA TO

THAT WHOLE KIND OF PROCESS THAT

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.450
THEY UNDERTOOK IS REALLY WHAT

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:54.585
THIS AND AND AND RESULTED IN

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.786
THEIR PAY DATA COLLECTION FORM

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:56.654
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.189
IS WHAT THIS BILL IS BASED ON

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.191
REALLY GOOD INVESTIGATION AND

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:02.359
AND AND ANALYSIS -- AS CENTER

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:03.661
JACKSON MENTIONED THE REAL KEY

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:05.496
IMPORTANCE OF HIS BILL IS THAT

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:06.697
WHILE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT EQUAL

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:09.967
PAY AS A MATTER OF IT WOMAN A

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.035
VERSUS WOMAN BE -- MAN BE

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:12.236
PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.537
WORK AND WHETHER THEY'RE BEING

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:14.004
PAID EQUALLY FOR THAT

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:15.539
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.308
ANOTHER REALLY PERVASIVE PROBLEM

00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:19.043
THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.244
GENERATIONAL WAGE GAP.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.146
IS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:22.947
WHICH IS A VERY ENTRENCHED

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.782
PHENOMENON WHEREBY WOMEN AND

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.817
PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN FOCUSED IN

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.319
ARE CONCENTRATED IN LOWER PAID

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.187
POSITIONS WITHIN A COMPANY OR

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:31.455
EVEN WITHIN INDUSTRIES.

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.290
AND AS CENTER JACKSON ALLUDED TO

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.625
A LOT OF TIMES THOSE TRENDS ARE

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.760
KNOWN BY AN EMPLOYER AND SO THIS

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.795
DATA COLLECTION WILL GIVE

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:38.929
EMPLOYERS OPPORTUNITY TO

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:40.698
IDENTIFY TRENDS WITHIN THEIR OWN

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:42.633
COMPANY THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.300
BEEN AWARE OF AND THEN

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:44.001
POTENTIALLY.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.502
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES REGARDING

YEARS AGO WHICH WAS

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.938
UNPRECEDENTED I THINK FOR THE

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:15.973
BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO COME OUT

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:17.407

PARTICIPATED IN THE TASK FORCE

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:22.346
TO IMPLEMENT THAT LEGISLATION

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:23.947
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS -- THE

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.149
TASK FORCE THAT WAS CREATED AS A

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:25.983
PART OF THE COMMISSION ON THE

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:27.050
STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.086

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:36.093
AND OUR CONCERN OUR PRIMARY

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.261
CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL ON

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.862
THE COLLECTION OF DATA IS THAT

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:39.997
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.565
BEING TOLD TO EMPLOYERS WITH

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.868
REGARDS TO THE FAIR PAY ACT THE

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.637
FAIR PAY ACT THAT FUNDAMENTAL.

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:47.237
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FAIR PAY

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:47.971
ACT WAS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:50.607
COMPARE TO PEOPLE BASED UPON JOB

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:53.410
TITLES OR THEIR THEIR POSITION

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.578
THAT IT SHOULD BE COMPARATIVE

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.313
BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DUTIES

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.281
THAT THEY ARE PERFORMING.

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.315
AND THIS DATA COLLECTION

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.084
REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO COLLECT

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.020
DATA AND REFER A REPORT DATA

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:05.322
BASED UPON JOB TITLES ALONE.

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:06.990
AND SO TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.792
GOING TO SOMEHOW ILLUSTRATE A

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:10.360
DISPARITY IN PAY UNDER OUR FAIR

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:12.429
PAY ACT IS INCONSISTENT WITH

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:13.730
WHAT THE COMMISSION HAS PUT OUT

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:14.631
OR SKEWS ME THE TASK FORCE IS

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:15.065
PUT OUT.

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:16.800
WITH REGARDS -- TO IMPLEMENTING

THE FAIR PAY ACT AND IT'S

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.303
INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LAW

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:21.238
ACTUALLY REQUIRES FOR EMPLOYERS

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:22.339
WITH REGARDS TO THE FERRET PACK

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.408

JOB POSITIONS ACCORDING TO

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:27.511
DUTIES NOT ACCORDING TO TITLE --

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:30.013

TO THE W. TO INFORMATION THAT'S

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.617

IMPACTED BY PERSONAL DECISIONS

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:36.587
OF THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES THE

RATE OF PAY THAT THE EMPLOYER

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.624
PROVIDES THAT NEEDS TO BE THE

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.658
DETERMINING FACTOR.

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.160

ACTUALLY EXISTS -- OUR OTHER

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.208
CONCERN IS THAT IS APPLICABLE TO

00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:59.509
ANY EMPLOYER WITH A HUNDRED MORE

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.911
EMPLOYEES BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:02.246
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A HUNDRED

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.647
MORE EMPLOYEES HERE IN

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:04.448
CALIFORNIA.

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:05.415
AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS REPORT

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:06.750
IS ONLY LIMITED TO THOSE

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.018
EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.786
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.355
UNIQUE AND THE REST OF THE

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.656
COUNTRY DOES NOT NECESSARILY

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.157
HAVE THE SAME EQUAL PAY LAWS

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:15.425
THAT CALIFORNIA DOES AND SO FOR

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.493
COLLECTING DATA.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.661
ON EMPLOYEES AND OTHER STATES

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.096
WHAT RELEVANCY IS THAT FOR

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:21.098
PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.799
OR NOT I EMPLOYERSARE COMPLYING

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:24.835
WITH CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL PAY LAW.

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:27.104
ADDITIONALLY -- I'VE HEARD ALSO

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.905
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.207
YOU CAN JUST SUBMIT THE EO ONE

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:31.541
FORM AND BE COMPLIANT WITH THE

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.043
SLOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:33.777
SAYS IT SAYS IF IT'S

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:35.012
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.380
INFORMATION THEN YOU CAN COLLECT

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.948
OUR ESTIMATE THE EO ONE FORM BE

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:39.549
COMPLIANCE BUT OUR CONCERN IS.

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.418
THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.719
NOT THE EO ONE FORM AND THIS

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:48.225
REPORT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.127
MAY I BE IN THE AGENCIES

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:50.961
PERSPECTIVE NOT THE SAME AND SO

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:51.561
YOU ARE CREATING AN ADDITIONAL

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:52.429
BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS TO SUBMIT A

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:52.896
SEPARATE DATA REPORT.

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:53.664
IF IT IS THE INTENT OF THE

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.765
AUTHOR WHICH WE HOPE IT IS THAT

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.732
YOU CAN JUST SUBMIT THE EO ONE

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:56.833
FOREMAN BEING COMPLIANCE AND WE

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.502
WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATION

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.337
IS AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.538
AND FINALLY I'LL SAY THERE'S A

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.673
LOT OF COMPANIES WHO HAVE DONE

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:03.540
AMAZING THINGS SINCE THE FAIR

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.042
PAY ACT WAS IMPLEMENTED THEY

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.243
HAVE DONE INTERNAL AUDITS THEY

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.911
HAVE DONE INTERNAL HE REPORTS TO

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:08.979
MAKE SURE.

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.147
THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:11.114
FAIR PAY ACT BUT AGAIN THOSE

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.582
AUDITS ARE BASED UPON

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:14.051
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DUTIES

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:15.085
THEY'RE NOT BASED UPON JOB

00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:16.653
TITLES AND SO THOSE AUDITS ARE

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.654
NOT THE SAME AS WHAT'S BEEN

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.789
REQUESTED AS A PART OF THIS DATA

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:19.790
REPORT.

00:49:19.856 --> 00:49:20.757
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.025
CONCERNED WITH THE BURDEN THIS

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:23.026
IS A PLACE IN ON THE EMPLOYER

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.961
WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:25.629
COLLECTED IN BEING SUBMITTED HIS

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.331
EVEN RELEVANT FOR PURPOSES OF

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:30.734
CALIFORNIA'S FAIR PAY ACT.

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:31.301
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:35.005
OPPOSED.

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.406
MR MILLER JR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS

COUPLE OF COMMENTS TO THOSE

ALREADY ENUMERATED BY MYSTERY OR

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.960
THE FIRST IS THAT I'M NOT SURE

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:58.662
THAT THE EO ONE FORM IS THE

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.896
PANACEA OF THAT.

UNDER THE LAW AS WHETHER OR NOT

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.011
IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.813
IS SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.715

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:19.916
BONTA FIGHT FACTORS.

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:22.586
A AS TO WHY PAY DISPARITY IS IN

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:25.055
FACT LAWFUL SUCH AS EDUCATION

TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN OTHER

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.392
WORDS WE WOULD HOPE THAT.

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.893
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:39.202
MONTHS.

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:43.407
THE SECOND POINT IS.

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:43.974
MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.442

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:09.346
OF THE F. B. H. REQUIREMENTS AND

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:10.380
LAW AND NOW IS IT IS.

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.115
BUT THE GOAL IS TO GET THESE

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.717
COMPANIES TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.619
WE HAVE TO START HIRING WOMEN IN

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:17.387
HIGHER LEVEL POSITIONS BECAUSE

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:19.823
WE ARE DISCRIMINATING BASED ON

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:21.157
JOB CATEGORY.

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:25.528
AND THIS IS A SOFT TOUCH I HAVE

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.197
RECORDS ACT SOMETHING I WOULD

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:28.264
NEVER.

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:31.067
UP BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS TO

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.702
LOOK IN THE AGGREGATE.

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:33.903
WE ARE NOT LOOKING

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:36.306
MICROSCOPICALLY COMPARING ONE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.341
SHOP AGAINST ANOTHER WHERE THE

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.409
WHOLE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:41.244
ISSUE MIGHT COME IN WE ARE

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.881
LOOKING AT JOB CATEGORIES.

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:48.952
AND I I LOW FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:49.552
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:50.220
TIMES I'VE HAD TO SAY THAT THIS

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.222
IS NOT ABOUT THE FAIR PAY ACT

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.590
AND I WILL TELL YOU MISS PEREIRA

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:55.058
HAS BEEN A ROCK STAR.

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.993
ON THE FAIR PAY ACT BUT THAT

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.195
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THE FAIR

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:00.597
PAY ACT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.565
THE DISCRIMINATION THE

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.234
HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.535
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:07.771
APPLYING FOR A JOB ONE OF THEM

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:09.539
IS TO BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE VADER

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.807
SECRETARY IT HAS BEEN

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:12.676
HISTORICALLY FAR MORE LIKELY

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:14.277
THAT THAT'S THE JOB THE WOMAN

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:15.578
WILL GET.

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.313
AND FREQUENTLY IMPORT EMPLOYERS

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.582
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT THAT IS

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.084
TRUST IN IMPLICIT BIAS THAT

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.219
EXISTS EVEN IF THAT WOMAN MAY

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:25.522
VERY WELL BE MORE QUALIFIED THAN

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.190
THE MAN WHOSE PULL APPLYING FOR

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:28.591
A POSITION.

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:31.327
THAT WILL ALLOW -- FOR GREATER

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:33.830
JOB GROWTH AND HIGHER

00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:35.465
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THAT.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.600
JOB FRAMEWORK SO THIS BILL IS

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:42.572
ABOUT JOB SEGREGATION THIS BILL.

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:45.709
IS SOME -- DESIGNED TO USE THE

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.644
E. L. ONE SO LONG AS IT IS IN

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.813
PLACE AND I'M TOLD THAT IN FACT

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:50.980
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.282
NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:54.684
HAS DECIDED TO APPEAL THE

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.952
DECISION.

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:57.854
ON THIS BILL ARE SO TO THE

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:00.523
EXTENT THAT FOR SOME REASON.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.559
THE COURTS ULTIMATELY OVERTURN

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.327
THIS LOWER COURT'S DECISION.

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.628
THIS WILL BE THE LAW HERE IN

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.030
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.531
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT'S GREAT

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:09.899
TO SEE SOME COMPANIES TAKING

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.468
THAT STEP FORWARD BUT WE HAVE A

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.269

LONG TIME AGO.

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.220
BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GOING

00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:32.122
TO MOVE US FORWARD AND GOING TO

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.690
GET US TO A POSITION.

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.759
WHERE WE CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.230
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.700
THIS IS THE RETROACTIVITY OF

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.601

PREVIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS

COMMENTS [inaudible]

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:13.648
LIKE.

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.216
TO YEAH ONE QUESTION FOR THE

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:20.956
LAST WEEK.

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:21.990
SO IT IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT IF

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:22.991
THIS WERE TO PASS SAYING THAT

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.459
IT'S CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW --

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:25.127
THAT THAT WOULD SORT OF BE

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.895
DISPOSITIVE OF THE MATTER AS FAR

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:27.929
AS THE COURTS -- CONCERNED THAT

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:28.563
BECAUSE TODAY'S LEGISLATURE HAS

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.132
GIVEN ITS INTERPRETATION OF

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:32.134
EXISTING LAW -- A COURT WOULD

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.102
AUTOMATICALLY APPLY THAT SAME

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.804
INTERPRETATION WELL I'M NOT AN

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:36.771
ATTORNEY AND I TRY TO PLAY ONE

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:39.374
ON TV BUT I THINK THE COURT

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.909
WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME.

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.744
OVERCOMING THE LEGISLATIVE FIAT

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.379
THAT THIS IS A CLARIFICATION

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.647
EXISTING LAW AND THEREFORE IT'S

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:46.915
BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A LONG PERIOD

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:49.050
OF TIME.

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.085
BUT THAT THAT BEYOND AS IT WERE

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.753
WOULDN'T.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.622
ACTUALLY APPLY IT RETROACTIVELY

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.223
IT WOULD SIMPLY EXPRESSED THE

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:57.292
OPINION OF TODAY'S LEGISLATURE

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.927
AS TO WHAT.

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.028
YESTERDAY LEGISLATURE

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.096
LEGISLATURE TO PASS THAT

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:02.497
INTENDED CRACKS THAT WOULD

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.132
NECESSARILY BE DISPOSITIVE.

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.800
I WOULD AS SOON THAT ANY GOOD

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.502
ATTORNEY WHO HAS ISSUES WITH

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.770
THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS WOULD

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.238
TAKE THE LEGISLATIVE A

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.573
CLARIFICATION THAT IS EXISTING

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.274
LAW.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.642
AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.110
AND GO AFTER EXISTING POLICY

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:18.547
SAYING THEY WERE INVALID.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.181
WHICH IS TO SAY TO MAKE SENSE TO

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:20.749
ME.

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.650
YEAH THE OTHER ONE THAT'S AYE

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:22.951
AYE BEING RETROACTIVE

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.686
RETROACTIVE -- NUMBER IT IS

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.421
RETROACTIVE AND I I DO WANT TO

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:29.624
SAY ONE THING AND I INSPIRED ONE

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:30.525
WAS WHAT HE SAID.

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:31.726
WHY ARE THE OTHER LINES OF

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.195
INSURANCE AND I HATE TO SAY THIS

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:34.262
WHY THE OTHER LINES OF INSURANCE?

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.630
NOT INCLUDED IN THIS WHY IS IT

OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.720

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.324

APPROPRIATELY POINTS OUT THE

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:33.508
ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE OTHER SIDE

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.377

THAT BUT BASICALLY ON POINT

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:49.958
DIRECTS THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE

FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS THIS

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:40.978
PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:43.714
BUT WE THINK TO THE IMPORTANT AT

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:45.750
AND NEEDED -- CHANCE FOR THE

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:52.556

02:28:52.623 --> 02:28:53.791
THAT THE OPPORTUNITY AND IT'S

VERY PLEASED TO HEAR -- CENTER

THE END OF THE PILOT AND I THINK

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.054
THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:25.856
SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION -- ON

OUTCOMES -- OF SUCH A NEW

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:31.295
PROPOSAL THAT -- WE THINK LIMITS

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.930
ON THE LIBERTIES OF OF

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:35.299

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:37.401
BEING SAID WE DO REMAIN --

02:29:37.468 --> 02:29:39.737
OPPOSED TO THE TO THE BILL AND

02:29:45.376 --> 02:29:46.911
LIKE TEN FORTY FIVE DOES TAKE

02:29:51.582 --> 02:29:54.185
HAVE NOW UNDER -- THE CURRENT

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.887
LAW WHICH I THINK -- HAS QUITE

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:59.557
FAIRLY ADEQUATELY BALANCED

02:29:59.623 --> 02:30:01.826

THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE --

02:30:10.801 --> 02:30:14.205
THAT BALANCE -- THE THE OTHER --

02:30:14.271 --> 02:30:16.307
ITEM THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.476

02:30:26.384 --> 02:30:29.720
MOSTLY GAS ALONG THE WAY GUESS

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:31.622
GUESSES -- ALONG THE WAY ON WHAT

02:30:31.689 --> 02:30:33.624
THAT NUMBER WOULD BE IT STARTED

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:36.627
OFF -- LOWER -- I THINK IS

02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:39.897
HEARING THE NUMBER NOW 527-5 AND

02:30:39.964 --> 02:30:47.905

02:30:47.972 --> 02:30:49.940
FROM ADVOCATES -- IN SAN

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:51.075

02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:40.624
ULTIMATELY MEANS THAT

02:31:40.691 --> 02:31:43.828

02:35:53.644 --> 02:35:54.712
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:56.914
ALL THE DUE PROCESS IS THERE AND

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.782
THAT WE PROTECT THEM FROM.

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:00.984
THOSE OVER ZEALOUS -- PEOPLE WHO

02:36:01.051 --> 02:36:03.087
SIMPLY WANT THEM OFF THE STREETS

02:36:03.153 --> 02:36:05.656
AND WANT THEM PUT AWAY --

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:06.590
WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THEM

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:07.257
AGAIN.

02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:10.360
BUT TO TO FIND A WAY. TO TO TO

02:36:10.427 --> 02:36:12.696
TAKE CARE OF THEM.

02:36:12.763 --> 02:36:14.932
IT'S THIS IS THIS IS A TOUGH.

02:36:14.998 --> 02:36:16.867
ONE BUT I APPRECIATE.

02:36:16.934 --> 02:36:18.268
COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION

02:36:18.335 --> 02:36:19.503
BECAUSE I THINK IT MADE THIS

02:36:19.570 --> 02:36:22.873
BILL A LOT BETTER -- WITH MORE

02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:25.976
PROTECTIONS -- THANK YOU.

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:28.712
THANK YOU THIS CAR.

02:36:28.779 --> 02:36:31.081
YEAH I AM.

02:36:31.148 --> 02:36:35.119
I JOIN UP WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN --

02:36:35.185 --> 02:36:36.720
THIS IS A DIFFICULT I KNOW IT'S

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:37.621
NOT EASY FOR YOU CENTER WIENER

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:39.623
BECAUSE IT IS I KNOW WHERE YOUR

02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:40.357
COMPASSION YOUR SENSIBILITIES

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:45.596
LIE -- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND --

02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:46.430
IT WILL BE WE HAVE A CRISIS IN

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:47.197
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:36:47.264 --> 02:36:49.333
AND I THINK ALL OF US AGREE THAT

02:36:49.399 --> 02:36:50.968
WE NEED MORE SUPPORT OF HOUSING

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:52.703
AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU I AND I

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:53.470
THINK MANY OF US UP HERE

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:54.605
SUPPORTED.

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:58.876
AS WELL -- AND END IN ON AND AND

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:00.544
FRANKLY.

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.045
YOU KNOW IN MY PAST LIFE I HAVE

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:03.013
CLIENTS THAT I PROBABLY WISH I

02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.716
COULD OF CONSERVED BUT I'M GLAD

02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:07.084
I DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO THE

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:07.751
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER

02:37:07.818 --> 02:37:10.654
TO SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A REALLY --

02:37:10.721 --> 02:37:12.089
I THINK THAT THE FACT AND I

02:37:12.156 --> 02:37:13.457
THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION

02:37:13.524 --> 02:37:15.159
INDICATES THE THE AMENDMENT

02:37:15.225 --> 02:37:17.327
CERTAINLY MAKE IT A BETTER BILL

02:37:17.394 --> 02:37:18.962
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A DUE

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:21.331
PROCESS AND THAT THE PERSPECTIVE.

02:37:21.398 --> 02:37:23.634
OF ENSURING THAT TO THE THE

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:25.936
SCOPE IS LIMITED -- BUT BY THE

02:37:26.003 --> 02:37:28.372
GOVERNMENT -- BUT ULTIMATELY IT

02:37:28.438 --> 02:37:29.106
IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT WERE

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:31.542
GIVEN THE ABILITY -- TO TAKE A

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:36.747
LIBERTIES AWAY AND I YOU KNOW.

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:39.983
I I KNOW THAT -- IT IN I THINK

02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.318
THE OFTENTIMES -- BUT WITH BILLS

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.452
LIKE THIS WERE CLEARLY I MEAN

02:37:42.519 --> 02:37:43.587
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:45.155
A LOT OF PAIN.

02:37:45.222 --> 02:37:49.593
THAT -- CAN ASK FOR HELP AND

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:53.230
NEED HELP -- AND SO THE

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:54.798
INTENTIONS -- I BELIEVE ARE A

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:56.867
100% GENUINE OF CERTAINLY FROM

02:37:56.934 --> 02:37:59.336
YOU SENATOR -- IT'S UNINTENDED

02:37:59.403 --> 02:38:00.604
CONSEQUENCES SPECIALNESS

02:38:00.671 --> 02:38:02.339
POLITICAL PRESSURE.

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:04.708
AND MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS

02:38:04.775 --> 02:38:06.276
TO KIND OF CLEAR THE STREETS. TO

02:38:06.343 --> 02:38:07.811
BEAUTIFY GET RID OF THE WHOLE

02:38:07.878 --> 02:38:09.012
BLIGHT.

02:38:09.079 --> 02:38:09.546
THAT'S WHERE I GET WORRIED

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:10.747
THAT'S WHY THESE CHECKS AND

02:38:10.814 --> 02:38:13.150
BALANCES IN THE REVIEWS AND THAT

02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:13.650
THE DATA COLLECTION ON

02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:14.918
DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ALL GOING TO BE

02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:16.920
CRITICAL IN AND I REALLY LOOK AT

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.723
THIS -- AS A TRUE PILOT I I KNOW

02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:20.958
THAT OFTENTIMES PILOTS ARE PUT

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:23.126
IN PLACE AND THEN IT GETS TO THE

02:38:23.193 --> 02:38:23.994
END OKAY LET'S MAKE A PERMANENT

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:26.797
NOW -- YOU KNOW I THINK MANY OF

02:38:26.864 --> 02:38:29.666
US -- WILL LIKELY STILL BE HERE.

02:38:29.733 --> 02:38:31.101
WHEN WHEN THE WHEN THE PILOT?

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:32.836
A COMES TO A CONCLUSION.

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:37.374
AND I'LL BE -- IF IF MY SUPPORT

02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:38.342
CONTINUES FOR THE BILL AT THE

02:38:38.408 --> 02:38:38.876
I'M I'M DROPPING IN THE BE

02:38:38.942 --> 02:38:41.278
LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY -- AT THE

02:38:41.345 --> 02:38:44.014
DATA AND I KNOW THE OPPOSITION

02:38:44.081 --> 02:38:45.449
ON I KNOW YOU WILL AS WELL A

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:46.216
CENTER -- AND I THINK THAT TO

02:38:46.283 --> 02:38:47.918
REALLY SEE IT HAS THE DESIRED

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:49.920
OUTCOME OF ACTUALLY HELPING.

02:38:49.987 --> 02:38:51.922
THOSE -- THAT OUR CONCERT AND

02:38:51.989 --> 02:38:52.823
NOT JUST SIMPLY WAREHOUSING

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:54.124
PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM OUT OF

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:55.092
SIGHT OUT OF MIND.

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:56.426
BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE WORRY

02:38:56.493 --> 02:38:57.661
WHENEVER THERE'S WELL

02:38:57.728 --> 02:38:59.363
INTENTIONED BILLS AND IN THE

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:00.530
HISTORY WE HAVE.

02:39:00.597 --> 02:39:02.499
IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THIS

02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:04.334
NATION IS IS NOT A GOOD -- ONE

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:11.408
BUT AGAIN GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:12.009
SPEARHEADING IT GIVES ME SOME

02:39:12.075 --> 02:39:14.978
SENSE OF COMFORT -- AND THE FACT

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:16.680
THAT IT'S AN THREE JURISDICTIONS

02:39:16.747 --> 02:39:18.115
AND CAN BE MONITORED AS SUCH --

02:39:18.181 --> 02:39:18.916
INTO ANIMAL IN A MORE NARROW

02:39:18.982 --> 02:39:20.550
SCOPE AS OPPOSED TO A STATEWIDE

02:39:20.617 --> 02:39:22.719
PILOT -- AND THREE JURISDICTIONS

02:39:22.786 --> 02:39:23.353
I KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN.

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.154
FACING A LOT OF ISSUES IN TERMS

02:39:24.221 --> 02:39:26.890

02:39:26.957 --> 02:39:31.395
ISSUES OF OF OF IT IN IN THEIR

02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:34.298
COMMUNITIES -- BUT I WAS AS A

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:36.633
STATE OF BY -- BY OPPOSITION YOU

02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:39.670
KNOW THAT THE THE THE STATUS OF

02:39:39.736 --> 02:39:41.605
OTHER THE HOMELESS OR OF BEING

02:39:41.672 --> 02:39:45.909
AN INCONVENIENCE OR ALONE --

02:39:45.976 --> 02:39:47.778
CANNOT BE THE JUSTIFICATION TO

02:39:47.844 --> 02:39:49.112
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TYPE OF

02:39:49.179 --> 02:39:52.082
ACTION SO -- AGAIN I'LL I'LL

02:39:52.149 --> 02:39:54.518

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:55.719

THAT.

02:39:56.353 --> 02:39:57.387
THE AMENDMENTS I THINK

02:39:57.454 --> 02:40:02.826
DEFINITELY MAKE IT A BETTER BILL --

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:04.928

URGENCY BECAUSE WHAT YEAH

CERTAINLY IF IT IS ABLE TO GET

02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:15.806
PASSING IT SIGNED INTO LAW.

YOU ARE OUR BY THE DIRECTION WE

02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:34.544
NEED TO MOVE IN AND I THINK IT'S

02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:38.048
BEEN STATED BY OTHERS TODAY THAT.

02:42:38.115 --> 02:42:39.916
MANY OF THESE ISSUES UNLESS YOU

02:42:39.983 --> 02:42:40.684
YOU KNOW.

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:41.718
TRULY DEAL WITH THE MENTAL

02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:45.255
HEALTH OR DRUG ADDICTION ISSUE.

02:42:45.322 --> 02:42:47.157
THAT PERSON IS GOING TO CONTINUE

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:49.993
BE BACK ON THE STREETS.

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:52.262
THERE IS NO EASY ANSWERS.

02:42:52.329 --> 02:42:54.464
CERTAINLY IN DEALING WITH -- YOU

02:42:54.531 --> 02:42:55.599

02:42:55.665 --> 02:42:57.267
HAVE IN IN THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:42:57.334 --> 02:42:59.102
CRISIS THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:00.570
THINK THIS IS A A TOOL THAT I

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:02.706
LIKE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS IN

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:04.107
THESE IN THESE COUNTIES IN.

02:43:04.174 --> 02:43:06.009
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S THAT

02:43:06.076 --> 02:43:09.813
IS SUCCESSFUL -- LOOK AT HOW WE

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:11.648
CAN EXPAND THAT OUT.

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:14.484
SO CHANGE SHOULD THE AUTHOR AND

02:43:14.551 --> 02:43:15.085
I WILL BE SUPPORT IN THE BILL

OF THE SENTIMENTS THAT I SHARE

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:23.860
OF ALREADY BEEN -- HAVE ALREADY

02:43:23.927 --> 02:43:25.629
BEEN DELINEATED BUT I JUST WANT

02:43:25.695 --> 02:43:27.697
TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR FOR

02:43:27.764 --> 02:43:29.733
MOVING THIS FOR I THINK YOU AND

02:43:29.799 --> 02:43:31.668
THIS BILL ARE OFTEN

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:33.904
MISINTERPRETED AND MISUNDERSTOOD --

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:36.273
BUT THE REALITY IS AND TOO MANY

02:43:36.339 --> 02:43:37.908
OF OUR STREETS AND CERTAINLY AND

02:43:37.974 --> 02:43:40.177
THE CITY THAT YOU AND I SHARE

02:43:40.243 --> 02:43:41.778
REPRESENTING -- WE HAVE

02:43:41.845 --> 02:43:42.979
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:43:43.046 --> 02:43:44.848
LITERALLY IN TREMENDOUS

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:46.449
RESTAURANT IS HARMON ARE DYING

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.451
ON OUR STREETS AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:43:48.518 --> 02:43:50.253
MORE WE HAVE TO THINK

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.154
DIFFERENTLY.

02:43:51.221 --> 02:43:52.856
AND I HAPPEN TO BE ONE WHO

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:55.192
THINKS IT IS PROGRESSIVE FOR US

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:57.227
AS A STATE. TO PROVIDE THE HELP

02:43:57.294 --> 02:43:58.929
THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT IN A

02:43:58.995 --> 02:44:00.864
VERY CAREFULLY SCULPTED WAY

02:44:00.931 --> 02:44:02.599
WHICH I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS --

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.167
AND TO DO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK

02:44:04.234 --> 02:44:05.168
OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:06.703
DO IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:09.039
THAT WE SPEND -- TO TO ADDRESS

02:44:09.105 --> 02:44:10.941
THIS NEED SO -- CERTAINLY

02:44:11.007 --> 02:44:12.576
APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF

02:44:12.642 --> 02:44:14.444
THE OPPOSITION AND I KNOW THAT

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:16.580
THE AUTHOR HAS IT'S NOT HARD AND

02:44:16.646 --> 02:44:18.848
HOW TO INCORPORATE -- THE VALID

02:44:18.915 --> 02:44:22.385
FEEDBACK -- BUT WITH THAT --

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:24.287
LOOK FOR TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:24.588
[inaudible]

02:44:24.654 --> 02:44:25.589
THANK YOU.

02:44:25.655 --> 02:44:26.256
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:28.291
CONCERNS ME IS WHEN WE START

02:44:28.358 --> 02:44:29.793
TALKING ABOUT DETAINING PEOPLE

02:44:29.859 --> 02:44:31.595
FOR THEIR OWN GOOD BECAUSE OFTEN

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.363
THE CONVERSATION ENDS THERE.

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:35.065
AND IF THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING

02:44:35.131 --> 02:44:36.032
ABOUT THAT IT BECOMES TO

02:44:36.099 --> 02:44:37.267
TENSIONS ROOF KIND OF THE

02:44:37.334 --> 02:44:39.402
CONVENIENCE OF OF OTHERS RATHER

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:41.504
THAN SOMETHING THAT THAT.

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:42.872
REALLY IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:44.741
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT THAT

02:44:44.808 --> 02:44:45.508
ARE THERE.

02:44:45.575 --> 02:44:46.610
AND THAT'S WHY FOR THIS

02:44:46.676 --> 02:44:48.878
COMMITTEE.

02:44:48.945 --> 02:44:51.414
I REALLY PUSHED BACK IN AND THE

02:44:51.481 --> 02:44:52.916
HAD STAFF PUSHED BACK TO MAKE

02:44:52.983 --> 02:44:54.351
SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING SOME

02:44:54.417 --> 02:44:55.619
APPROPRIATE BOUNDS AROUND THIS

02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:58.421
INCLUDING THE DATA COLLECTION.

02:44:58.488 --> 02:45:00.223
BECAUSE SENSE.

02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:01.758
YOUR LAST BILL PASSED ACTUALLY

02:45:01.825 --> 02:45:02.726
BEEN APPROACHED BY A NUMBER OF

02:45:02.792 --> 02:45:04.427
COUNTIES WHO WANT TO PARTAKE IN

02:45:04.494 --> 02:45:06.363
THIS AND I FOR ONE AM UNWILLING

02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:07.764
TO DO THAT AND I THINK WE SHOULD

02:45:07.831 --> 02:45:08.632
BE VERY CAUTIOUS.

02:45:08.698 --> 02:45:10.500
IN EXPANDING THIS PILOT UNTIL WE

02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:13.837
GET SOME REAL DATA IN ABOUT.

02:45:13.903 --> 02:45:14.638
WHO'S BEING SERVED HOW THEY'RE

02:45:14.704 --> 02:45:16.439
BEING SERVED WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:45:16.506 --> 02:45:17.941
THESE INDIVIDUALS.

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:19.643
AND COUNTIES WITHOUT THE SAME

02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:21.144
RESOURCES OR WITHOUT THE SAME

02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:23.747
COMMITMENT. TO REALLY RESOLVING

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:25.682
SOME OF THE ISSUES COULD USE

02:45:25.749 --> 02:45:27.684
THESE TOOLS IN A WAY THAT I

02:45:27.751 --> 02:45:29.352
THINK A LOT OF US MIGHT FIND AN

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:30.153
APPROPRIATE.

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:32.322
AND REALLY MORE TOWARDS THE

02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.889
DETENTION FOR THE SAKE OF

02:45:32.956 --> 02:45:33.857
DETENTION.

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.625
AS OPPOSED TO A STRUCTURE THAT

02:45:35.692 --> 02:45:37.193
THAT.

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.695
REALLY ADDRESSES THE MOST

02:45:38.762 --> 02:45:41.064
DIFFICULT INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE.

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:42.732
AND SERVICE THEM.

02:45:42.799 --> 02:45:44.067
IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY.

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:45.835
SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE

02:45:45.902 --> 02:45:46.836
BALANCE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

02:45:46.903 --> 02:45:50.206
STRIKE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT.

02:45:50.273 --> 02:45:51.775
WE ARE REALLY ADDRESSING THE

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:53.076
UNDERLYING NEEDS AND IF WE'RE

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:54.878
GOING TO GO TO THE PROCESS WE

02:45:54.944 --> 02:45:56.613
BEING STATE CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL

02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:57.647
JURISDICTIONS GOING TO GO

02:45:57.714 --> 02:45:59.149
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DETAINING

02:45:59.215 --> 02:45:59.816
SOMEONE.

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:01.618
THEN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THOSE

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:03.687
CIRCUMSTANCES. FIFTY ONE FIFTIES

02:46:03.753 --> 02:46:05.455
PRETTY LOW STANDARD YES EIGHT OF

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:06.890
THEM ARE A LOT.

02:46:06.956 --> 02:46:08.525
BUT FIFTY ONE FIFTIES OFTEN GET

02:46:08.591 --> 02:46:10.327
USED AGAIN AND AGAIN WHAT WE

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:11.361
WOULD HATE TO SEE A CIRCUMSTANCE

02:46:11.428 --> 02:46:13.129
WHERE SOMEBODY HAS SEVERAL FIFTY

02:46:13.196 --> 02:46:14.397
ONE FIFTIES AND THEN IT LOCAL

02:46:14.464 --> 02:46:15.865
JURISDICTIONS AS WELL IF WE JUST

02:46:15.932 --> 02:46:16.733
DO A COUPLE MORE.

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.735
WE CAN THEN DETAIN THAT WE CAN

02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:19.869
DO OTHER THINGS FOR THEM.

02:46:19.936 --> 02:46:21.805
THAT'S NOT THE REASON FOR THE

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:22.872
FIFTY ONE FIFTIES IN FACT

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.674
THERE'S A FIFTY TO FIFTY SECTION

02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:27.477
WHICH REQUIRES A LOT MORE.

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.746
OF A MENTAL HEALTH ANALYSIS OF

02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:30.947
AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

02:46:31.014 --> 02:46:32.549
TRYING TO PUSH THIS MORE TOWARDS

02:46:32.615 --> 02:46:34.084
THAT SO THAT.

02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:35.218
THERE ARE [inaudible]

02:46:35.285 --> 02:46:37.487
OFTEN.

02:46:37.554 --> 02:46:38.822
IT MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE

02:46:38.888 --> 02:46:40.924
OFTEN GO HAND IN HAND BUT NOT

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.759
ALWAYS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE.

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:45.862
THAT WE ARE APPLYING THE RATE.

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:48.231
REMEDIES TO THE SITUATION AGAIN

02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:49.332
RATHER THAN JUST SWEEPING PEOPLE

02:46:49.399 --> 02:46:52.569
UP FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF OF THE

02:46:52.635 --> 02:46:54.537
LOCAL JURISDICTION.

02:46:54.604 --> 02:46:55.004
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:56.406
CALIFORNIA'S NOT REALLY

02:46:56.473 --> 02:46:57.474
FUNCTIONING THAT WELL WE KNOW

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:59.409
THAT IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG

02:46:59.476 --> 02:47:00.977
TIME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:01.978
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT.

02:47:02.045 --> 02:47:03.513
THE FACT THAT.

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:04.714
COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATOR

02:47:04.781 --> 02:47:06.049
SITTING ON SO MUCH MENTAL HEALTH

02:47:06.116 --> 02:47:07.817
SERVICES ACT MONEY WITHOUT BEING

02:47:07.884 --> 02:47:09.152
ABLE TO SPEND IT.

02:47:09.219 --> 02:47:10.653
THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE AN

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:12.455
ALARM BELL TO US THAT THAT IT'S

02:47:12.522 --> 02:47:13.857
NOT WORKING BECAUSE THERE IS

02:47:13.923 --> 02:47:14.624
MONEY TO BE ABLE TO BE APPLIED

02:47:14.691 --> 02:47:15.658
IT JUST.

02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:17.293
ISN'T AND I THINK THAT.

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.661
THE STATE HAS A LOT OF

02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:20.130
RESPONSIBILITY THERE BECAUSE IT

02:47:20.196 --> 02:47:21.564
HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTING COUNTIES

02:47:21.631 --> 02:47:22.532
IN GETTING THAT'S MONEY SPENT OR

02:47:22.599 --> 02:47:24.367
BEEN WILLING TO GET MONEY SPENT

02:47:24.434 --> 02:47:25.635
WHICH WOULD REALLY HELP.

02:47:25.702 --> 02:47:27.470
DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE EXACT

02:47:27.537 --> 02:47:28.605
POPULATIONS.

02:47:28.671 --> 02:47:30.106
BUT IT'S BEEN FRACTURED FOR A

02:47:30.173 --> 02:47:31.941
LONG TIME ESPECIALLY GO BACK TO

02:47:32.008 --> 02:47:33.810
THE TIME WHEN WE CLOSED.

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:35.812
STATE CLOSED -- MENTAL HEALTH

02:47:35.879 --> 02:47:37.881
FACILITIES WITHOUT ANY.

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:40.350
REPLACEMENT WITHOUT ANY FOLLOW

02:47:40.417 --> 02:47:42.385
UP OR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE

02:47:42.452 --> 02:47:43.953
SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITIES AND

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:46.489
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT.

02:47:46.556 --> 02:47:47.290
BUT A HEALTH BETS JUVENILE ADULT

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:48.057
MEN HEALTH AS WE SHOULD BE

02:47:48.124 --> 02:47:49.159
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE PUT THOSE

02:47:49.225 --> 02:47:50.627
RESOURCES BACK IN OUR

02:47:50.693 --> 02:47:52.729
COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:47:52.796 --> 02:47:52.996
THE MOST.

02:47:53.062 --> 02:47:54.364
CHRONIC.

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:56.199
CASES THAT THAT WE SEE IN OUR

02:47:56.266 --> 02:47:58.034
COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S A LITTLE

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.936
BIT OF OF THE SENSITIVITY AND

02:48:00.003 --> 02:48:01.271
CENTER UNIT.

02:48:01.337 --> 02:48:02.372
THAT CONVERSATION.

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:04.140
SO AS THIS MOVES FORWARD.

02:48:04.207 --> 02:48:05.742
THEY WITH THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:07.010
NEED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.545
TO SAY OKAY WE'VE ALLOWED THIS

02:48:08.611 --> 02:48:11.381
TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO BE

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:13.450
HOLDING.

02:48:13.516 --> 02:48:14.751
SERVICES GO AND THE TEEN DIEGO

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:16.553
LA SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO ADOPT

02:48:16.619 --> 02:48:18.755
THIS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT

02:48:18.822 --> 02:48:20.490
HAPPENS FOR THE NUMBERS.

02:48:20.557 --> 02:48:22.225
BECAUSE AS A PILOT AS MISTER

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:23.126
KALRA SAYS.

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:25.829
IT'S GONNA BE VERY TEMPTING FOR

02:48:25.895 --> 02:48:26.830
OTHER JURISDICTIONS THEY'LL LET

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:27.831
US JUMP IN LATEST BUT ISSUES

02:48:27.897 --> 02:48:28.832
THIS AS WELL.

02:48:28.898 --> 02:48:30.567
AND WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM

02:48:30.633 --> 02:48:31.868
THIS PILOT FROM THE DATA

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:35.171
COLLECTION IS WHAT WORKED WHAT
