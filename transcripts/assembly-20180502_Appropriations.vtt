FIRST WE BELIEVE THIS BILL

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.759 region:rollup2
CREATES A NEW STATE MANDATE WITH

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:09.160 region:rollup2

A DISPUTE.

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:37.522 region:rollup2
THE NEW PROCESS UNDER THEM AND

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:39.057 region:rollup2
BE A PART WOULD NEED TO EMPLOY A

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:40.458 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL. CONSULTANTS.

00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:42.160 region:rollup2

FURTHERMORE TO MANAGE THE MBA

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:47.198 region:rollup2
PROCESS WOULD NEED TO HIRE AT

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:48.466 region:rollup2
LEAST THREE NEW PEOPLE.

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:50.401 region:rollup2
AT AN ANNUAL COST OF

00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:50.868 region:rollup2

THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND.

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:53.771 region:rollup2
.

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:55.106 region:rollup2
IN TOTAL THIS IS A POTENTIAL

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:56.007 region:rollup2
REIMBURSABLE COST OF NEARLY

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:57.375 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:59.577 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST YEAR.

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:00.945 region:rollup2
NECKS A IT WOULD BE A GREATER

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:02.113 region:rollup2
FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE THAN

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.714 region:rollup2
A MODEST COST OUTLINED IN THE

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:05.516 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:07.652 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS SUPPOSES THAT ONLY

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:08.186 region:rollup2
A MINOR NUMBER. OF DISPUTES EACH

00:43:07.652 --> 00:43:09.854 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:11.155 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BASED ON THE CURRENT

00:43:09.854 --> 00:43:12.590 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DISPUTES BETWEEN BART

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
AND THE EMPLOYEE UNION THE

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.193 region:rollup2
FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE WOULD

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.061 region:rollup2
BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE FORTY

00:43:15.193 --> 00:43:18.830 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. A DOLLAR ESTIMATE FOR

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.364 region:rollup2
THESE REASONS MARK OPPOSES A. B.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:24.602 region:rollup2
THIRTY THIRTY FOUR RESPECTFULLY

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:25.470 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AN OBOE.

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:27.772 region:rollup2
THANK YOU KNOW IS THERE

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:31.309 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION.

00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:31.809 region:rollup2
I FINANCE NO FILE.

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:33.311 region:rollup2
I THINK MISTER QUIRK HAS

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:35.613 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:37.548 region:rollup2
YEAH SHOW FOR THE PROPONENTS.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:39.984 region:rollup2
A TECHNICAL QUESTION WHY IS

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:42.153 region:rollup2
THERE THIS BIG DIFFERENCE IAN

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:43.988 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES OF COSTS.

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:46.324 region:rollup2
AND AND HOW DO YOU BAY ISSUERS

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:49.494 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD HOW THE BASE THERE'S.

00:43:46.324 --> 00:43:51.062 region:rollup2
PART IS BASING OF THEIR COSTS

00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:54.065 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS ON.

00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:54.765 region:rollup2
EVERY DISPUTE THEIR CURSE

00:43:54.065 --> 00:43:56.868 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:58.536 region:rollup2
AND OUR MEMBERS AS GOING TO PER

00:43:56.868 --> 00:44:01.172 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL BE THE CASE.

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:02.940 region:rollup2
RARELY DO DISPUTES RISE TO THE

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:04.675 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ACTUALLY FILING AN

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.043 region:rollup2
UNFAIR PRACTICE BEFORE PER. WE

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:07.378 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HOPE THAT THE STATURE

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:10.148 region:rollup2
OF A FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY AN

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:11.749 region:rollup2
NDA. AND HAVING PROVES OVERSIGHT

00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:13.017 region:rollup2
WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE TOTAL

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.218 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DISPUTES

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.686 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WE

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:17.388 region:rollup2
GET TO THE LEVEL OF HEADING

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:19.056 region:rollup2
TOWARD SOMETHING LIKE PER. OKAY

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.925 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:22.960 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLICATED THEY'RE GONNA.

00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:25.096 region:rollup2
AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT AND THEY

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.565 region:rollup2
NEED THREE NEW PEOPLE TO

00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:30.168 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS DONE.

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:32.470 region:rollup2
BOB I THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:34.338 region:rollup2
BART HAS A VERY ROBUST LEGAL AND

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.340 region:rollup2
LABOR RELATIONS TEAM WITH.

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:38.109 region:rollup2
VERY TO EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THAT

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.310 region:rollup2
TIME THE BART INCLUDING SOME

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:41.712 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.914 region:rollup2
UNDER AN MBA AND WHISPERED SO I.

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:44.715 region:rollup2
FIND IT IS CHANGED INTERESTING

00:44:42.914 --> 00:44:46.017 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO AUGMENT

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
THEIR STAFF TO. DO THIS FOR A

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:48.819 region:rollup2
UNIT THAT ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:50.821 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MEMBERS. AND THAT WILL

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
LIKELY NOT RESULT IN VERY MANY

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:53.224 region:rollup2
CASES ACTUALLY GOING TO PER.

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:57.528 region:rollup2

THREE OR FOUR PART COMPLAINTS

THAT MAYBE THERE'S PROMISED

00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:06.804 region:rollup2
