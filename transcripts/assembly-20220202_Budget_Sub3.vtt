00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.352
THEY'RE MAKING THE PROGRAMS I

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:49.687
COULD FIND. TAKES OF THINGS. WE

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:50.788
THINK THOSE ARE REALLY. QUESTION

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:52.390
THAT THE LETTER OLD TO BUY AND-

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:55.260
BEFORE ACTION PROVIDE SOME TIME

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:57.162
FOR. THE TO COME FORWARD WITH A

00:29:57.228 --> 00:30:00.465
DETAILS BE VERY. ALSO WE NOTE

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:02.200
THAT AND THERE ARE I KNOW

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.968
PROGRAM THAT WERE FINE AS PART

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:05.737
OF PASSED. THERE PROPOSED

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.805
BRITISH FUNDING AS PART OF THIS

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.707
PACKAGE. I MEAN EVEN THE

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:11.743
IMPORTANT TEN ONLY FOR ME. ON

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:14.979
WHAT PLANNED FOR THAT. BY THINK

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:17.148
. I'M ANYTHING THERE THERE'S

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.851
SOME OF QUESTIONS THAT BUT- ALSO

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.419
I THINK EVEN FOR. ON PROVIDED

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:35.600
FIND. OVERSIGHT HEARING THE

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:36.901
MINISTRATION IS REALLY MADE A

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:38.136
LOT OF PROGRESS IN GETTING EARLY

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.837
ACTION FINDING OUT THE BEST

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.639
AJORITY OF. HIS HAVE GOTTEN OUT

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.775
BUT AT LEAST AS OF DECEMBER ONLY

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:46.477
ABOUT 7% OF THE TWENTY ONE

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.512
TWENTY TWO FUNDING HAD BEEN

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:48.446
COMMITTED TO PROJECTS AND OF

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.447
COURSE ONCE. SPENDING IS

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.149
COMMITTED IT STILL. TAKES A

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.717
LITTLE WHILE FOR THOSE- PROJECTS

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:55.787
ACTUALLY- BE COMPLETED SO. NOT

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.188
SURPRISINGLY IN MANY CASES

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:58.556
INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOMES OF

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.291
THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY AND-

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.292
IT'S PRETTY LIMITED AT THIS

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.494
POINT- WE DO EXPECT THAT MISSION

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.196
OPERATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.197
THE COMING MONTHS WE THINK THAT

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:07.632
THAT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.933
SHOULD HELP INFORM LEGISLATIVE

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.935
DECISION MAKING- AND WE WOULD

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:11.970
KNOW IN PARTICULAR THAT THE

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.638
LEGISLATURE AB REQUIRED

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:14.872
ADMINISTRATION TO COME FORWARD

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:16.808
WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT. AND THE

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.209
FIRST OF THOSE ANNUAL REPORTS IS

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.245
EXPECTED IN APRIL AND SO WE HOPE

00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:21.045
THAT THAT WILL INCLUDE SOME

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.947
REALLY HELPFUL INFORMATION. ON

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.015
WHAT HAPPENED WITH PASSED

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:26.050
FUNDING THAT CAN HELP INFORM.

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:27.151
FUTURE DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.886
WANT TO SEE OKAY WELL WE ARE

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:30.388
THERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.689
BEEN BETTER AT GETTING FINDING

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.191
OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY. ARE THERE

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.325
SOME THAT HAVE REALLY

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.893
ACCOMPLISHED MORE AND MAYBE

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.095
THEY'RE AREAS YOU WANT INVEST

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:42.333
MORE MONEY- RELATIVE TO OTHER

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.503
AREAS. WHEN YOU SEE HOW IN FOR

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.437
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ALL

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:49.841
TO THE TO FUNDING. SO THIS.

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.442
CLOSE ISN'T THAT POINT BILLION

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.778
BASIC BE EQUALLY AND THE NEXT TO

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:56.881
AND BUDGET YEAR YOU'RE ONE. I'M

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.449
REALLY WE THAT THERE'S A TRADE

00:31:58.516 --> 00:31:59.684
AND CHECK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.319
APPROACH IN SOME CASES- FOR

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.987
EXAMPLE THERE SENATE TO THAT

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.422
REALLY REQUIRES SUSTAINED

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.591
FUNDING NOT JUST ONE TIME

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:07.959
FUNDING TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE.

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.861
EXAMPLES ABOUT OR THINGS LIKE

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:10.595
SOME OF THE FORCE HEALTHCARE

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.464
PROJECTS- DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:15.833
ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND IT TAKES A

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.336
PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT- YOU

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:20.838
GET NOT JUST BENTENG BRIGHT YOU

00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:22.540
KNOW MEDITATION GROWS BACK ON

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.275
THOSE PROJECTS HAVE TO BE

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:24.942
MAINTAINED. THEY HAVE TO

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:26.244
CONTINUE TO OCCUR WE HAVE JUST

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.879
THE SCALE OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:29.047
TO BE DONE ALSO IT IS VERY

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:30.615
SIGNIFICANT SO IT'S KIND OF AN

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:32.450
ON GOING KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:33.651
THE LEGISLATURE WILL PROBABLY

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:35.820
WANT TO FIND- SO YOU MAY WANT TO

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:36.954
THINK ABOUT WHETHER IN SOME

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.189
CASES ONGOING FUNDING IS

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.891
APPROPRIATE- WE DON'T THINK YOU

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.759
THANK GOD YOU'RE F. IT'S

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.628
PROPOSED. TO LAST FOR THE NEXT

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.196
TWO YEARS BUT THAT- THE GENERAL

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.631
FUND COMPONENT IS ONLY A TWO

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.833
YEAR PEACE. I'M AND WE ALSO KNOW

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.035
THAT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS FOR

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:51.903
WHICH THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:53.838
DETAIL AT THIS POINT ON WHAT'S

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.973
HAPPENED SO IT MAY BE HARD TO

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.942
FUNDING DECISIONS FOR BEYOND

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:00.912
JUST THE BUDGET YEAR. BURKE

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:01.546
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.680
SAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE FOR

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:03.514
EXAMPLE HOME GARDENING PROGRAM

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.916
WHICH IS JUST GETTING OFF THE

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:07.085
GROUND NOW VERY VALUABLE AND

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.353
POTENTIALLY BUT THERE'S NOT A

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.921
LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:11.723
IT'S GONNA WORK. AND THERE'S NOT

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.024
A LOT OKAY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S A

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:14.659
NEW PROGRAM THE BUDGET THAT YOU

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.027
JUST FUNDED LAST YEAR IT'S JUST

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.628
GETTING OFF THE GROUND. SO YOU

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.063
CAN SEND TO YOURSELF BUT YOU

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.565
ALSO CONSIDER TO SPENDING ONE

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.934
YEAR- SEEING HOW. YOU'RE

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.168
COMFORTABLE WITHOUT TENS AND

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:34.912
THEN MAKING- ADDITIONAL

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:36.347
DECISIONS LATER. THE FOURTEENTH

REALLY VALUABLE BUT WE THINK

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:07.145
THAT'S GONNA BE. CONTINUE TO BE

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.980
REALLY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WE

EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:12.950
REALLY DEDICATED A LOT OF

00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:15.353

ONLINE. WELL THERE'S THAT

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.872
REQUIREMENT IN THE LEGISLATION

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.106
THAT THERE BE SOME OVERSIGHT

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:44.008

TRAINING- GROUP THAT HAS TO BE

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.883
DONE AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.684
DEVELOP THE COURSE CURRICULUM SO

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.052
IN TALKING WITH THE OFFICE OF

00:35:58.055 --> 00:36:00.224
CURRICULUM. TO GET THE OVERSIGHT

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:02.727
REVIEW- THAT'S NECESSARY AND

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.495
THEN TO GET IT POSTED AN

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:05.763
AVAILABLE ONLINE- THAT THAT'S

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.764
JUST THE TIMELINE THAT THEY CAME

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.433
UP WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TALKING

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.969
TO MEMBER DOLLY THAT THERE IS

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:12.870
OTHER COUNTIES THAT ALREADY HAVE

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.806
THE THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE WOULD

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.141
BE JUST AS EASY TO GO GET IT

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:18.910
FROM THEM AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:22.313
GO THROUGH ALL THAT THAT. COULD

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.015
CHANGE THE WILL OF THE WAGON- I

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:25.182
WOULD NEED TO TALK WITH THE

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:26.017

ANOTHER COUNTY STARTED TO

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:39.664
ANOTHER STATE AGENCIES DOING IT.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.266
THAT WE SHOULD ALREADY BE ABLE-TO IMPLEMENT A PRETTY QUICK. AND

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:46.037

THE- BILL AS IT. PASSED THE LAWS

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.720
FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS TO STILL

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:03.955
FUNCTION EVEN BEFORE THE

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.823
TRAINING IS AVAILABLE SO. I

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.924
THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.225
WAY BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY FOLLOW

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:09.360
UP WITH THAT OBSOLETE FOR

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.261
MARSHALL WE CAN GET BACK WITH

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:15.032
DROPS. MISREAD DID YOU HAVE A

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:15.800
QUESTION. I DO AND I DO CAME IN

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.935
FOR THE HEARING ABOUT PORTS SO I

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.070
MISS MOST OF YOUR PRESENTATION

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.204
SO THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE FOR

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:23.140
THIS QUESTION. JUST LET ME KNOW

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:25.476
. BUT MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.777
GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE EXPENDITURE

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:29.313
PLAN. SO IF THEY CAN IS THIS AT

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.483
THE RIGHT TIME TO ASK THAT. YEAH

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.353
OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS THAT A

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:38.589
CLEARLY. POST WILDFIRE.

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:39.890
RESTORATION IS GOING TO BE

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:40.591
VITALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.393
HEARING A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM A

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.729
LOT OF GROUPS ABOUT FIRST OF ALL

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.530
MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER IS

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:48.466
DONE IN TERMS OF RESTORATION

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.601
PROVIDES NATIVE PLANTS AND

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.204
HABITAT FOR OUR NATIVE ANIMALS

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.372
AND JUST I CAN JUST SAY

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.673
ANECDOTALLY WATCHING WHAT'S

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.941
HAPPENED CERTAINLY IN THE PAST

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.542
WITH REFORESTATION AT LEAST IN

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.811
MY AREA WAS CHAPARRAL. THERE'S

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:02.713
BEEN A TERRIBLE HISTORY OF

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.781
PEOPLE PLANTING NON NATIVE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:06.317
PLANTS- INAPPROPRIATE PLANTS

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:07.485
HAVE BECOME WE'VE LATER OR NOT

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:09.220
OPEN NOT PLANTING AT ALL AND

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.755
ALLOWING FOR INVASIVE PLANTS TO

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:13.391
COME BACK- I'M WONDERING WHAT

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.459
KIND OF OVERSIGHT DO YOU EXPECT

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.061
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE HAVE

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:19.897
FOR THESE REFORESTATION POLICIES

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:20.931
TO NOT ONLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:22.700
THEY'RE APPROPRIATE AND DONE

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.735
USING. THE BEST SCIENCE WITH AN

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.937
EYE TOWARDS MAINTAINING

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.506
CALIFORNIA'S. MADE OF

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:30.274
BIODIVERSITY BUT ALSO MAKING

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.275
SURE THAT THEY'RE RESILIENT TO

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.110
CLIMATE CHANGE SO THAT IF WE DO

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.812
EXPECT. THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.414
GOING TO CHANGE THE MIX OF WHAT

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.150
PLANTS CAN SURVIVE. THAT WE

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:41.852
DON'T THAT WE THAT WE DO ALL OF

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:43.487
OUR EFFORTS WITHOUT RESILIENCY

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.223
IN MIND SO THAT WE PROTECT OUR

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.858
INVESTMENTS AS WELL. I THINK

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:49.427
THAT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.162
POINT AND I WOULD THINK ONE OF

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.329
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:54.298
PROBABLY UP FRONT WORK THAT THE

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:56.367
COMMITTEE IS DOING- SO THERE'S A

00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:57.268
HUNDRED MILLION IS PROPOSED AS

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:59.603
PART OF PACKAGE FOR

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.237
REFORESTATION. LIKE FIFTY

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:02.506
MILLION EACH YEAR. I'M STILL GET

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:03.741
A LOT OF PROMISE I THINK THAT

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.476
THERE IS- PRETTY BROAD. THAT WE

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.645
NEED TO BE WORKING ON MAKING

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:08.713
SURE WE DON'T GET TYPE

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:09.947
CONVERSION MAKING SURE THAT

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.983
THEY'RE APPROPRIATE. TYPES OF-

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.186
PLANTS THAT ARE NATIVE AND THAT

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:15.886
ARE REALLY GOING TO BE

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.956
RESILIENT- THAT ARE THAT ARE.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.424
BACK IN THAT LANDSCAPE AFTER

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:21.726
THIS EXPERIENCE VERY SEVERE

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:24.795
WILDFIRES- BUT I THINK IT'S-

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:25.930
JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.164
COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THE

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.099
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:28.866
ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.534
COMFORTABLE WITH IT. AND I THINK

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:31.869
I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AT

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.170
THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.105
OF DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS OF

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.473
THEIR PROPOSAL FOR THAT FIND

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.007
THOSE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. SO I

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.609
THINK I AM PERHAPS ASKING THE

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:41.011
ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A PLAN

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:42.613
FOR HOW THEY EXPECT TO USE THAT

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.281
AND THEN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:45.116
INTERACT WITH SCIENTISTS AND

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.118
OTHERS. TO HELP INFORM THE

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:48.953
ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE DOLLARS

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.020
I'M SAID THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.222
REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:52.556
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DONE THAT

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.258
THAT CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT-

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:56.060
CONSISTENT WITH. BEST PRACTICES

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.428
AND ITS PRIORITIES AS WELL.

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:59.530
REALLY I'M A VERY IMPORTANT

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.031
FIRST STEP AND THEN OF COURSE

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:01.532
I'M HERE THERE'S ONGOING

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.801
MONITORING AS WELL BUT I'M YOU

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.236
KNOW IT'S BETTER IF WE GET A

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.670
THAT GET IT RIGHT UP FRONT

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.939
RIGHT- MAKE SURE TO DO IT RIGHT

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.241
UP FRONT AND I AND I. AM

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.509
EXPECTING MINISTRATION PROBABLY

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.444
HAS HAD SOME PLANS THERE BUT- I

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.645
DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:15.613
DETAIL YET. I KNOW THE

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.448
ADMINISTRATION IS VERY COMMITTED

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:18.816
TO BIODIVERSITY SO I WOULD

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:20.351
EXPECT THEM CERTAINLY TO SUPPORT

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:22.353
THESE GOALS- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:24.021
MAKE SURE THAT. WHATEVER FLOWS

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:24.889
VERY NATURALLY CAN EXECUTIVE

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:27.358
BRANCH AN UP AND DOWN THAT WE-

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:28.692
ALSO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ON THE

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.427
GROUND WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK.

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.462
REALLY HAVE OVERSIGHT AND REALLY

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:33.030
HAVE TRAINING BECAUSE I HAVE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.732
SEEN JUST REALLY EGREGIOUS

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.133
EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST OF WHAT

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.802
HAPPENS WHEN IT'S DONE WRONG AND

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:38.769
I'LL JUST SAY ONE OTHER THING

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.037
IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT-

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.006
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONCERN

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:44.341
FROM. FOLKS- FROM UC DAVIS AND

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:53.551
OTHERS WHO STUDY WILDFIRE AND.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.118
RISSOIDAE REFORESTATION AND

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.386
RESETTING NATIVE PLANTS. THAT

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.253
SOME OF THE- BROAD STROKES THAT

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.988
WE DO WITH PAUL. THAT MAY WORK

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.056
OKAY IN SORT OF NORTHERN. FOR A

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.691
THAT AREA ARE STILL UP I STILL

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:01.759
YOU. IN SOME WAYS AND CHAPARRAL

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.093
AREAS IN SOUTHERN CAL. WITH

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.528
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO. HABITS

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:05.596
AND A LOT OF EXAMPLE THAT

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:07.464
THEY'VE SHOWN ME. WHERE NATIVE

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.333
HABITAT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.368
BEEN DISRUPTED OR- BURNED IN

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:14.471
APPROPRIATELY- AND ALLOWING FOR-

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.607
INVASIVE TO JUST TAKE OVER. SO I

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:17.975
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.010
KNOW WE'RE USING. OUR SCIENTISTS

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:21.879
AND THAT YOU KNOW CAL FIRE WHO'S

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.214
BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN IS

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.050
RIGHTFULLY ON. FIRE RESILIENCY

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.184
ALSO HAS SORT OF BEEN BEDDED

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.019
PEOPLE WHOSE. GOAL IS

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:32.122
BIODIVERSITY. AND PROTECTION OF

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:35.292
OUR NATIVE- ARE NATIVE- ECO

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:37.895
SYSTEMS IN THE MIX AT ALL TIMES

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.830
SO THAT THE WHATEVER THEY DO.

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.165
DOESN'T THAT WE'RE WORKING AT

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.399
THE SAME PURPOSE AND I GUESS

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.567
THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT BUT I

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.469
THINK WE NEED TO BE. MORE

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:46.337
DELIBERATE AND MORE INTENTIONAL

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:47.771
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HEAR THE

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.640
LEVEL OF ALARM. UP FROM SOME OF

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.141
OUR SCIENTISTS GIVEN THE THREATS

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.676
OF. CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE SAME

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:55.312
HABITATS THAT WE JUST HAVE TO BE

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:56.247
SURE THAT. IN OUR VIGOR TO

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.748
PROTECT. LIFE AND PROPERTY WITH

00:41:57.815 --> 00:41:59.383
FIRE WHICH OF COURSE. IS

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.117
IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.685
SACRIFICE OUR COLLEGE AT THE

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.354
SAME TIME. SO THESE ARE ALL

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.256
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS- AND I'M

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.590
GLAD YOU'RE ASKING THEM AND I.

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.659
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE- BEGAN BY

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.561
SUGGESTING THAT WE WAIT UNTIL

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.129
ALL THE PRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.530
MADE BEFORE IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH

NO OKAY THEN I THEN I WOULD ASK

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.809
THAT WE JUST HOLD OUR QUESTIONS.

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.511

THAT WE CONTINUE TO FACE ON

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.118
WILDFIRE BUT ALSO POINTED TO OUR

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:10.020
COLLECTIVE PROGRESS WHICH IS

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:10.621
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.024
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU MADE LAST

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:14.858
YEAR IN THE BUDGET BUT ALSO

OUR BUDGET PRESENTATION HERE

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.643
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE ASLEEP

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.777
GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.479
THE LAST FIRE SEASON OUR

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.381
STRATEGY AMIDST WORSENING

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.883
WILDFIRE CONDITIONS- HOW

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.852
INVESTMENTS HAVE BEGUN TO MAKE A

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:42.853
DIFFERENCE AND THEN OF COURSE

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.490
WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING I HEAR

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:47.491
TODAY THROUGH YOUR BUDGET SUB

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:48.625
COMMITTEE. SO AN OVERVIEW OF THE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.160
LAST WILDFIRE SEASON IS

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:52.496
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A ROUGH ONE.

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:54.398
FOR OF THE STATE'S LARGEST

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.967
WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY BURNED

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:59.937
LAST SEASON. EIGHT THOUSAND

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:00.904
EIGHT HUNDRED WILDFIRES BURNING

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.306
OVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:04.742
ACRES. MUCH OF THOSE ACRES

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.677
EXPERIENCING HIGH SEVERITY

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.012
BURNING THAT ESSENTIALLY

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:10.280
DESTROYED. HOMES AND COMMUNITIES

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.182
IN THEIR PATH BUT THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:14.318
THE ECOSYSTEM AS WELL. FOR THE

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.285
FIRST TIME IN OUR STATE'S

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:17.921
HISTORY TO WILDFIRES ACTUALLY

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:19.456
CRESTED THE SIERRA NEVADA.

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.392
HASN'T HAPPENED IN A HUNDRED AND

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.159
SEVENTY YEARS OF OUR STATE

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.427
HISTORY THAT WAS OF COURSE THE

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:25.329
DIXIE IN THE CALDOR FIRES. IN

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.698
THOSE FIRES. THOSE WILDFIRES

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.833
WERE JUMPING LITERALLY FIVE

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.402
HUNDRED FOOT CLIFFS. THERE WERE

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.704
FLAMES ARE ADVANCING THREE MILES

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.839
AHEAD OF THE WILDFIRE FRONT. AND

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:37.775
IN CERTAIN AREAS WERE BURNING

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:40.677
OVER TWICE IN THE SAME FIRE. WE

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:42.646
KNOW TRAGICALLY COMMUNITIES OF

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:46.683
GRIZZLY FELT FLAT AND GREENVILLE

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.451
WERE DECIMATED. A LOT OF

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.485
DESTRUCTION OF OUR UPPER

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:51.188
WATERSHEDS WHICH PROVIDES A THE

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.756
BEGINNING OF OUR SORT OF WATER

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.191
SYSTEM FOR ABOUT 60% OF THE

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.093
STATE'S WATER SUPPLY. TOSE

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.761
WATERSHEDS EXPERIENCE THAT HIGH

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.130
SEVERITY VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRE

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:02.199
BASED ON HOW HOT WILDFIRES ARE

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:06.070
BURNING NOW. WE LOST 15220% OF

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.938
OUR INCREDIBLE GIANT SEQUOIAS

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.274
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.809
SO THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY ALL THE

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.944
CHALLENGES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:14.912
WORSENING CONDITIONS FOR

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.947
WILDFIRE. REMARKABLY THEY

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:19.283
ALTHOUGH I KNOW CIVILIAN LIVES

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.452
LOST I IN THE LAST WILDFIRE

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:23.754
SEASON FRANKLY DUE TO HER ROIC

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.522
ACTIONS OF CAL FIRE AND THEIR

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.192
SISTER AGENCIES. WE KNOW THAT WE

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:30.461
NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.729
STRENGTHEN RESPONSE CAPACITY I

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.465
AM PROUD TO CALL CAL FIRE THE

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.200
MOST SOPHISTICATED WILDLAND

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.801
FIREFIGHTING FORCE IN THE WORLD.

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:38.969
I'M GOING TO COLLECTIVELY

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:40.871
CONTINUE TO BUILD THEIR CAPACITY

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.707
MORE FIREFIGHTERS MORE EQUIPMENT

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:45.342
MORE TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:46.944
DISCUSSED IN OTHER PORTION OF

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.745
THE BUDGET BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.013
CAN'T RESPOND OUR WAY OUT OF

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.982
THIS WILDFIRE CRISIS AND YOU ALL

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:53.717
HAVE BEEN GIVING VOICE TO THAT

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.953
REALITY FOR MANY YEARS. NOW WE

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.621
KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE PROACTIVE

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:59.990
UP FRONT ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:03.827
THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:04.828
. WHILE THESE WILDFIRES ARE

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.630
GETTING WORSE THE GOOD NEWS IS

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.332
THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE GETTING

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:10.767
BETTER. WE SAW THE LAST WILD

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.669
FIRE SEASON EFFORTS LIKE

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:15.005
STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS PRESCRIBED

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:16.940
FIRE HOME HARDENING ACTUALLY

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:18.609
WORK TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:21.178
ECOSYSTEM. GREAT EXAMPLE IS

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.913
RIGHT AROUND SOUTH LAKE TAHOE

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.415
WHERE I WALKED. LINES ARE THE

00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:27.151
PROTECTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.319
ALLOWED. FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.154
STAND TO PROTECT THOSE

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.255
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THOSE WERE

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.624
MADE POSSIBLE BY STRATEGIC FUEL

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.792
BREAKS THAT WERE PUT IN OVER THE

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.895
LAST SEVERAL YEARS SIMILAR FROM

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.062
FUEL BREAKS PROTECTED THE

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:41.698
COMMUNITY OF POLLOCK PINES. DOWN

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:44.468
THE FIFTY. SO THESE PROJECTS

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:46.036
SHOW US THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:48.105
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD OUR

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.139
RESILIENCE TO CATASTROPHIC

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.708
WILDFIRE. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.343
TAKE ACTIONS WITHIN COMMUNITIES

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.112
ARE MORE HOME HARDENING MORE

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.182
DEFENSIBLE SPACE BETTER PLANNING

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.816
WE NEED TO TAKE ACTIONS AROUND

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.151
COMMUNITIES MORE OF THESE

00:47:01.218 --> 00:47:02.819
STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS THAT ALLOW

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:04.488
WILDFIRES TO MAKE A STAND

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.757
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES. AND GIVE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.692
THOSE RESIDENTS TIME TO EVACUATE

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:10.594
AND OF COURSE LANDSCAPE LEVEL

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.896
PROJECTS THAT BOTH REDUCE THAT

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:15.232
SEVERITY OR THE HEAT AND SIZE OF

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:17.367
THESE WILDFIRES AND THEN ALSO

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:20.237
HELP US PROTECT THE HEALTH OF

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:21.538
THE FOREST AND THE LANDSCAPES.

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:23.640
WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS TO BE

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.676
BASED ON REGIONAL PRIORITIES. I

00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:26.977
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.446
POINTED OUT OUT IT IS NOT A ONE

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.948
SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION IN

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.349
CALIFORNIA WHAT WORKS IN THE

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.318
SIERRA NEVADA. OESN'T WORK IN

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.652
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND VICE

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:37.721
VERSA SO ALL OF THESE WERE ALL

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:38.922
THESE PROJECTS WHICH WILL TALK

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.824
ABOUT ARE BASED ON THE NEEDS

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:42.092
THAT CHALLENGES THE

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:43.927
OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH REGION.

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.162
AND OF COURSE ALL OF THIS WORK

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:46.997
NEEDS TO BE BASED ON THE BEST

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:47.598
AVAILABLE SCIENCE WHICH IS A

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:49.600
VALUE THAT WE ALL SHARE IN

00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.668
COMMON. NOW LOOK LET'S BE HONEST

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.070
WE KNOW CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO THIS

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:55.305
ALONE YOU KNOW TE FACTS WHICH

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:58.275
ARE- 57% OF OUR FOREST LANDS IN

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.943
CALIFORNIA ARE OWNED AND MANAGED

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.612
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:04.214
STATE ONLY OWNS 3% OF THOSE

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:06.583
FOREST LANDS BUT YET OUR STATE

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.552
GOT A BUDGET HAS SUBSIDIZED

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.020

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.372
LEADERS IN WHAT IS THE BEST

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.174
SCIENCE FOR THIS WILDFIRE

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.242
MANAGEMENT IN THESE THESE

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.545
DIVERSE PLACES THAT- THAT WE

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.880
HAVE- BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:33.348
BE THE BEST WAY FOR US TO ENJOY

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.817
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.919
WAYS FOR US TO ENSURE. A WE ARE

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:39.154
SPENDING THESE DOLLARS- AS

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:42.791
EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO I

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.326
HAVE A CONCERN THAT. WHEN YOU

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:45.861
HAVE A LOT OF NEW MONEY GOING

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.162
OUT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A DESIRE

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.497
TO TRY TO MEET REGIONAL NEEDS

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.467
THAT. THE REGIONAL NEED MIGHT BE

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.302
IDENTIFIED THAT MAY NOT MATCH UP

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:56.605
WITH THE BEST SCIENCE- AND SO IS

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:59.308
THERE A WAY FOR US ON A DO WE

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.543
ARE WE CURRENTLY. TRYING TO MAKE

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.045
SURE THAT WITH EACH OF OUR

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:05.047
PROJECTS WE ARE LEARNING MORE

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.582
ABOUT WHAT THE BEST SCIENCES

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.117
THAT WE ARE APPLYING BEST

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:09.752
SCIENCE. SO THAT WE HAVE THE

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.186
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.222
REGIONAL AREAS IDENTIFYING

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:15.524
THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.592
HAPPEN- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.127
THEY FIT INTO AN OVERALL PLAN

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.528
THAT SAYS THAT'S THE BEST

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.964
SCIENCE THE BEST APPLICATION- SO

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.700
FOR EXAMPLE- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.602
FRIEDMAN TALKING ABOUT WE- WE-

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.137
VEGETATE WITH PLANTS THAT WILL

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:30.839
BE BETTER FOR. FOR ALL OF US IN

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.507
THE LONG RUN INCLUDING FIGHTING

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.208
FIRES COULD COULD USE HELP ME

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.444
WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THAT HE I

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:35.878
KNOW YOU HAVE MANY

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.547
RESPONSIBILITIES- AND TRYING TO

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.482
MOVE ALL OF THIS I JUST WANT TO

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.351
TRY TO. SEE WHAT KIND OF SINCE

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.886
WE HAVE IN TERMS OF PAYING

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.922
ATTENTION TO THAT ONE-

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:47.489
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.424
THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY I REALLY

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.093
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALLOWS

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.028
FOR JESSICA TO JUMP IN AS WELL

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.430
SO ON THIS TASK FORCE WHICH IS

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.765
REALLY DRIVING OUR PROGRESS WE

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.700
HAVE A SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.403
COMMITTEE. THAT'S COMPRISED OF

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.906
SCIENTISTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.108
IN THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS-

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.343
FEDERAL LABS AT SENTARA. AND

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:11.513
THEIR THEIR PURPOSE ON THIS TASK

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.549
FORCE IS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.050
THE PLANS WERE PUTTING IN PLACE

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.118
AND ULTIMATELY THE WORK WE'RE

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.853
DOING IS GROUNDED IN THAT BEST

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.154
AVAILABLE SCIENCE SO I'D SAY

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.656
THAT'S- THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:21.957
WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT'S

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:22.858
HAPPENING THERE. I SHOULD

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.226
MENTION THAT THE WORK OF THE

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.460
TASK FORCE INCLUDING THE

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.029
COMPOSITION OF THE SCIENTIFIC

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:28.463
ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IS ALL

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:30.399
AVAILABLE ONLINE AND ONE WOULD

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:32.067
JUST HAVE TO GO GOAL-

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.203
GOVERNOR'S. WILDFIRE AND FOREST

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.771
RESILIENCE TASK FORCE. AND

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.207
YOU'LL SEE ACTUALLY A REAL TIME

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:40.008
UPDATE ON THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.543
THAT WE'RE TAKING. I THOUGHT

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.278
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS WERE

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:44.012
REALLY EXCITED ELSEWHERE IN THE

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.747
BUDGET. THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:47.616
INVESTMENTS IN CLIMATE SCIENCE

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.551
AND CLIMATE RESEARCH. TO THE

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.654
UC'S AND CSU SYSTEM FOR MORE OF

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.189
THAT INDEPENDENT RESEARCH THAT'S

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.058
GOING TO DRIVE- WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:58.260
ON ON WILDFIRE SCIENCE. AND THEN

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.395
I'LL ALSO SAY. YOU KNOW THE

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:01.363
POINT THAT YOU ALL HAVE STRESSED

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.065
AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LEADERS

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.733
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.068
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:07.102
NECESSARILY WORK IN SOUTHERN

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.637
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE VERY

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:10.272
SENSITIVE. WITH THE CHAPARRAL

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.140
ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.709
THAT WERE. CONSERVING THE

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:14.910
CHAPARRAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEN

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.312
RE FOREST ING THOSE LANDSCAPES

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:18.280
TO THAT BACK TO THE CHAPARRAL

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.448
ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.383
THAT WE'VE NOW INTERNALIZED AND

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.085
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.620
SORT OF DEPARTED FROM A TOP DOWN

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.355
APPROACH ON PLANNING AND REALLY

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.890
FOCUSED ON MORE OF A BOTTOM UP

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:30.325
WITH REGIONAL. STRATEGIES AND WE

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:31.393
DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.629
REGIONAL EFFORTS THAT ARE FUNDED

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.664
BY THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:38.200
SCIENCE. SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.302
COMMITTEE ON THAT TASK FORCE. SO

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.004
THAT'S SOME OF THE CONNECTIVITY

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.540
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A WORK. IN

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.876
PROGRESS JESSICA. ABSOLUTELY IS

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.444
HIGHER INVESTMENT IS REALLY

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.546
ANGERED IN SCIENCE- WE WERE SO

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.049
GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:55.550
HELPING US SECURE TWENTY FIVE

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.685
MILLION DOLLARS FOR REMOTE

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:59.288
SENSING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.956
FIVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- OR

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:03.058
I'VE GROUND SCIENCE AS WELL AND

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.294
SO THAT COMBINATION OF INVESTING

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.264
IN. RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS- AND I

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:11.266
FY A PLEASURE FORCED INVENTORY

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.001
ANALYSIS PLUS WHICH ALLOWS THE

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.770
STUDY SEGMENTS OF FORCED

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:15.771
OVERTIME ON THE GROUND IN

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.372
ADDITION SHE REMOTE SENSING

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.608
WHICH GIVES US I INVESTMENT SUCH

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.743
AS LIDAR WHICH WE'RE LEVERAGING.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.679
THOSE WINDS AT USGS JUST

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.648
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.984
AWARD US FUNDING FOR A LIGHTER

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.919
ACROSS NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.854
CRITICAL WATERSHEDS- INCLUDING

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.789
THE NORTH COAST AND MUCH OF THIS

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:36.058
YEAR- WHICH IS GOING TO HELP US

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.326
GET THAT REAL TIME ASSESSMENT.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:39.828
ONLINE POST FIRE WATERSHED

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:42.564
RECOVERY FOR EXAMPLE- STORE

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.132
REALLY GROUNDING IN THIS AND

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.367
SCIENCE AND THEN IF YOU ALSO

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.202
LOOK AT MOST OF THE PROGRAMS FOR

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.937
EXAMPLE- STATE PARKS IS A GREAT

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.606
MODEL. OF DOING REAL TIME

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:54.609
ANALYTICS- AS THEY ARE ROLLING

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.346
OUT NEW MODELS FOR RESILIENCY

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:58.780
I'M STILL EVEN OUR PROGRAM

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.382
DOLLARS ARE INVESTING IN THAT

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.652
SCIENCE. AS WELL AS THESE DIRECT

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:06.755
LINES I'M A FOR. DATA ANALYTICS

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.023
AND REMOTE SENSING TO HELP US

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.257
IMPROVE OUR MODELS AND OUR

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.193
FEEDBACK LOOPS. THAT WE ARE

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.194
PLANNING WITH THE BEST SCIENCE

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.628
AND- JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:15.230
EXAMPLES OF THAT SO. FOR

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.432
EXAMPLE- CALIFORNIA PARTNERED

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.201
WITH- IT WITH SEVERAL OF THE

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:22.537
UC'S TO DESIGN- ALL POLL PROGRAM

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:24.639
THAT IS A LONG TERM- PROJECT

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.975
WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING AT. HOW

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:29.978
SEEDLINGS FARE- FROM LOWER

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.680
ELEVATIONS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:32.981
AND FROM HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.517
LOWER ELEVATIONS OF TAKING-

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.386
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIKE GIANT.

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.620
WHITE AND NATIVE PLANTS AND

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.589
PULLING THEM INTO YOUR-

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.624
DIFFERENT ECO ZONES AND CLIMATE

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.493
ZONES WHERE THOSE PLANS ARE

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.293
STILL NATIVE. AND TESTING

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:54.403
OUTSIDE CLIMATE. RESILIENCE

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:56.371
REFOREST RIGHT. TRYING TO PLAY

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:57.406
FOR HIGHER- GOING TO SURVIVE

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.674
BETTER AT LOWER- AND HARD. IN

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.176
THE ERA WHICH SO THERE'S A LOT

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:02.611
OF REACH HOW ON THE ROUND NOW

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:04.713
GETTING BACK THE LOOP. THE OTHER

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:05.981
THING WE'RE DOING IS IN IS

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:08.517
THAT'S NEW IN THIS. WE TEN

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.918
MILLION DOLLAR LAST YEAR OF OUR

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:10.886
ONE AND ARE NOW ASKING FOR IT IS

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:13.188
A STATE. AND INTO THE STATE. FOR

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:15.724
A SYSTEM THIS IS WHERE WE BACK.

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.760
TO BE A TO DO. LONG TERM ALONG-

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:21.963
EXPERIMENTS AND HAVE- HAD TELL

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.999
US ABOUT FOREST HYDROLOGY I

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:27.035
RESTORATION ECOLOGY AND HOW OUR

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.770
TREATMENTS ON THE GROUND FOR A

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.739
PRESCRIBED FIRE TWO MASTICATION.

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:32.474
ARE IMPACTING LONG TERM FOREST

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.608
HEALTH AND CARBON STORAGE STILL

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.477
ALLOWS US TO HAVE THOSE

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.579
CONSISTENT. NUMBER HAVE BEEN IN

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:38.980
THE STATE OWNERSHIP FOR SOME OF

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:40.549
THEM SEVENTY YEARS THAT ARE

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.818
ALLOWING US TO SEE CHANGE OVER

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:46.088
TIME. AND AND GET REALLY SOLID

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.589
EUROPEAN SCIENCE- THAT IS

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.324
INFORMING OUR MANAGEMENT

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.093
PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE. JUST

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.461
VERY BRIEFLY IF I COULD FOLLOW

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:53.795
UP I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.363
ANSWERS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:56.598
SINCERE COMMITMENT I'M THE

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.767
GENUINE COMMITMENT I'M HEARING-

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.135
TO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:03.472
IS- GOOD SCIENCE- ONE JUST QUICK

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:06.074
QUESTION IS THERE- ACT I

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.610
CERTAINLY WE ARE. INVESTING IN

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.445
RESEARCH EXTENT OR IS THERE SOME

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.614
KIND OF SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW OF

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:13.949
EACH PROJECT AS IT GOES OUT TO

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:16.017

BASICALLY THE TASK FORCE STAFF

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:16.858
IS MY SELF. IN A SENIOR

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:19.127

PRODUCTION BUDGET SO THAT'S

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:23.830
REALLY QUITE SUBSTANTIAL AND IN

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.765
TOTAL WILL BE OUT OF ALL THESE

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:26.933
PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE CAP

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.902
OUTLINES. ON YEAH THAT CLOSE TO

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.237
A BILLION DOLLARS NINE HUNDRED

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:31.204
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:33.273
YEARAND QUITE A BIT OF ONGOING

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.041
FINDING MOST OF ITS ONGOING SO

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:37.477
REALLY IT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:38.511
GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.947
DEDICATED. DEDICATED TO

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:49.389
INCREASING- SORT OF RESPONSE

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:51.591
RESOURCES. I SO AND EXCEPT FOR

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.459
ISN'T HAPPENED PRETTY

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:54.027
SUBSTANTIAL AND- THAT- HAVE BEEN

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.328
MADE TO. FIRE AND I'M- BY

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:56.563
DIFFICULT. FEW YEARS AS WELL.

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.299
OKAY I'M I'M ANOTHER KEY POINT

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:00.901
IS THAT IT'S AN- TO. AT THIS

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:02.302
TIME EXTENT TO WHICH TO MAKE

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:04.304
PROPOSALS WILL ENHANCE CAPACITY

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:07.507
- BACK THE END OF A WHAT. RANGE

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:08.074
WHICH IS A REALLY CRITICAL

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:09.542
PLEDGES IS GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:12.946
AS CONSIDERS ALL THESE PROPOSALS

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:13.813
- AND FILING THINK THAT THE

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:14.948
STATE WE CAN TAKE. ADVANTAGE

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:16.182
FROM DEVELOPMENT A STRATEGIC

01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:17.817
WILDFIRE. PLAN WE TALKED ABOUT A

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:19.619
COUPL OF YEARS. WE MADE THAT

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:20.587
RECOMMENDATION WE STILL THINK

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.088
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE WOULD

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:23.523
NOW WE TALK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:25.458
THIS HEARING ABOUT REPORTS THAT.

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:26.459
THAT HAVE MEANT THAT THE

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:27.827
INVESTORS AND HAVEN'T HAD A

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:29.562
CHANCE TO COMPLETE YET YOU OTHER

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:30.997
DEMANDS. I'M SO THIS IS ANOTHER

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:32.399
AREA OF THE LEGISLATURE ASKED

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:33.633
FOR RECORDS PRINCIPLE MIDDLE

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:36.002
REPORT. WHICH IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.304
TWENTY. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:39.906
DO YOU- APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY.

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:41.308
AND THAT REPORT AND IS STILL

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.575
PENDING WE THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:44.377
REALLY HELPFUL REPORTS TO HELP.

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:46.079
INFORM THE LEGISLATURE DECISIONS

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:47.747
BECAUSE THAT REPORT ASKED FOR

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.549
INFORMATION ON WHAT ARE THE

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:51.251
RESOURCES THAT CAL FIRE AND- YES

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:53.286
HAVE. WHAT ARE THE GAS WHAT ARE

01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:54.921
THE GOALS ONE OF THE COST

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.589
EFFECTIVE APPROACHES. WE

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:57.123
CONTINUE TO THINK THAT'S

01:49:57.190 --> 01:50:00.060
IMPORTANT. AND SO NOW DESPITE

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:02.262
THAT SETBACK THE- LACK OF THAT

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:03.363
KIND OF PLAN WE THINK THE

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.364
LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY IS GOING

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:05.832
TO NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.701
FUNDING. ABOUT DEALING WITH THE

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.736
RESPONSE NEEDS THAT THE STATE

01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.905
HAS- AND SO WE DID PROVIDE WE DO

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:21.648

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:23.149
I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THOSE.

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.050
THOSE THREE THAT WE'RE ABOUT

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:24.918

ACTION ON THIS GROUP. AT THIS

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.662
TIME THE REASON FOR THE- IS THAT

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:37.030
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE. AND

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:39.199
THREE RESTORE. THAT ARE- THAT

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:41.134

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:42.836
- BUDGET ITEM BUT THERE'S THAT

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:43.470
FOR HUNDRED. DOLLARS IT

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.971

FOR THE HEALTH AND- OF. I'M A

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:56.850
FIRE- WHO ARE ON THE LOOK AND SO

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:59.152
THE IDEA AS I AM IT AS IS WITH-

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.154
WITH THE FIRE JUST. TO DEVELOP

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:02.856
THE- OF WHAT THE PROPOSAL LOOKS

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.791

YOUR SEATS IS THAT THE STATE FOR

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:07.627
THE HEALTH OF. COMPONENT AND THE

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.763
PURPOSE. IS- INVISION TO BE

01:51:09.829 --> 01:51:10.797
PROVIDED AS PART OF THAT FOR HIM

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.265
BILLION SO I'M THAT THERE'S A

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:15.101
LOT. BETWEEN THAT MANY AND THIS

01:51:15.168 --> 01:51:16.836
PROPOSAL SO WE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:19.072
THINK ABOUT THEM- TOGETHER AND

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:20.740
TO SEND YOUR GRIEF. BECAUSE OF

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:22.142
THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:25.412
KIND OF PROPOSAL THAT- IT'S A

01:51:25.478 --> 01:51:27.013
LITTLE BIT- EXTRA. VALUE RATE

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.281
WITHOUT THIS KIND OF STRATEGIC

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:29.182
PLANNING PART OF IT'S JUST

01:51:29.249 --> 01:51:30.917
BECAUSE THIS IS EITHER SOME OF

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:32.485
THEM I'M PRETTY TECHNICAL THINGS

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:33.920
ABOUT WELL HOW HOW DO WE MAKE

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.321
DECISIONS ABOUT HELICOPTERS

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:37.123
VERSUS HOW MANY ENGINES HAVING

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:38.725
ENGINE SHOULD BE- YES ENGINES.

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.460
YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAINTAIN A

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.895
FLEET OF ENGINES WE TRIED SYSTEM

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:43.129
VERSUS CAL FIRE ENGINES THOSE

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:45.198
TYPES OF THINGS- SO WE THINK

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.499
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:49.035
OPTIONS THE CURRENT- ULTIMATELY

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.236
ONCE IT YOU KNOW I THINK RECEIVE

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:51.704
THAT THAT THE OTHER PROPOSAL IS

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.506
KIND OF DECIDING WHAT TO DO.

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.575
COULD APPROVE EVERYTHING AS- AS

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:56.910
REQUESTED OR COULD TAKE A

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:58.278
DIFFERENT APPROACH- FOR EXAMPLE

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.579
ONE THING THAT WE MENTIONED AS

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:01.381
AN ALTERNATIVE IS- YOU COULD

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:03.183
PROVIDE SOMEBODY RESOURCES THIS

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:05.285
YEAR DELAY PROVIDING SOME OF

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:07.053
THEM AND TO A FUTURE YEAR AND SO

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.788
YOU GET THAT- THAT IT'S EXPECTED

01:52:08.855 --> 01:52:10.423
THE ADMINISTRATION. TO HELP

GUIDE DECISION MAKING YOU COULD

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:13.059
POTENTIALLY DO IN A WAY THAT

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.527
WOULD NECESSARILY HOLD UP THE

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:15.895
RECEIPT OF THOSE SO ONE THING TO

01:52:15.962 --> 01:52:17.297
MENTION IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:18.465
FEW YEARS TO GET THE HELICOPTERS

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:20.333
ANYWAYS OR YOUR STANDING IS FOR

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.901
EXAMPLE FOR EVERY. HELICOPTER

DEPARTMENT. I SO- SO WE CAN IT'S

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:48.188
IMPORTANT TO THEM REALLY MAKE A

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:50.156
CASE FOR WHY EVEN THOUGH THIS.

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:52.559
ARE FRONT VEHICLE NEED THAT LOOK

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:55.295
. ALL THE TIME. I'M WELL AS Y.

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:57.030
YEAR REPLACEMENT CYCLE IS THAT

01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:58.264
FOR A FOR ALL THOSE CARS SO

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.800
YOU'RE- ARE. GREAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:01.801

FOURTEEN. DOLLARS EACH SENATOR

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:14.447

HUNDRED- VEHICLES FIVE YEARS-

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.787
AND THE CONSISTENCY. WITH OTHER

01:54:20.853 --> 01:54:23.056
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- WE THINK

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:24.490
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THEY JUST

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:25.091
THE AMOUNT OF ANY THAT'S IN.

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.893
HERE WE THINKS CAN IN AB- OR

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.262
TECHNO. AND VERY VALUABLE I'M

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:31.130
JUST TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.398

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:33.700
INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO THIS TO

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:35.001

FLEET OR LONGER REPLACEMENT

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:45.178
CYCLES MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT. I'M

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:46.946

02:10:23.582 --> 02:10:24.550
FORGETTING THAT THE CAMERAS OVER

02:10:24.616 --> 02:10:29.021
HERE- AND- COULD YOU COULD YOU

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:30.422
PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN THE

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.290
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:33.392
SOMEBODY ON THE PLANE VERSUS

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:35.861
HAVING SAY SOMEBODY A- COMMAND

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:37.296
CENTER RECEIVING ALL THAT DATA

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:38.363
FROM THE PLANE AND HAVING

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.632
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER. ALL OF

02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:43.202
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PLANE. WE

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:45.237
BOTH OBVIOUSLY HAVE MAN AND MAY

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:46.805
I HAVE THEIR UNIQUE VALUES.

02:10:46.872 --> 02:10:48.974
VALUE TO MANNED AIRCRAFT IT IS

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.676
SIMPLY THE US YOU KNOW FONG

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:51.777
FLYING THE AIRCRAFT AND WERE

02:10:51.843 --> 02:10:54.213
OVER AN AREA THAT WE'RE MAPPING

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:56.848
WE'RE DOING WHATEVER THAT THAT

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.584
THAT TASK MAY BE. I SEE SMOKE

02:10:58.650 --> 02:11:00.552
OUT THE DISTANCE I SEE SOMETHING

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:02.688
ELSE IT'S A LET LET'S GO CHECK

02:11:02.754 --> 02:11:04.356
THAT OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:05.390
ABILITY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:08.193
ABOUT FLYING UNMANNED AIRCRAFT

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.861
YOU KNOW THE SCREEN THAT THE

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:12.397
INDIVIDUAL AND AS- A MANAGING-

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:14.666
FLYING THAT AIRCRAFT IS LIMITED.

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:17.636
SO THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO THAT-

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.438
YOU KNOW THESE LARGER AIRCRAFT

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:22.941
LARGELY FLY AND CERTAIN YOU KNOW

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:24.776
DIFFERENT PATTERNS. THESE ARE

02:11:24.843 --> 02:11:25.978
CRAFTING GUILD OR OF YOU KNOW

02:11:26.044 --> 02:11:27.713
MANOR CRICKET LOWER AMERICAN

02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:28.847
MANNED AIRCRAFT THESE ARE ALL

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:30.315
PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT CAN GO

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.551
HIGHER- THEY CAN COMMUNICATE

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:34.753
DIRECTLY WITH THE OTHER

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.722
AIRCRAFT. IF NEEDED THE-

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.590
DECISION MAKERS ON THE GROUND.

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:39.825
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DANCE

02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.860
OFTEN ARE COMMUNICATING VIA

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:45.697
TEXT- THE- TO OUR FOLKS AT THE

02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:47.733
STATE OPERATIONS CENTER- PEOPLE

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.568
ON THE GROUND IT'S JUST A YOU

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:52.671
HAVE A LOT MORE VERSATILITY. IN

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:55.641
CAPABILITIES WHEN YOU DO FROM-

02:11:55.707 --> 02:12:00.379
NECESSARILY. AN UNMANNED

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:03.515
AIRCRAFT THANK YOU. HELLO THANKS

02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:05.017
I'M SORRY A QUESTION I THINK

02:12:05.083 --> 02:12:08.654
WOULD BE FOR TYLER- THE-

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:10.656
HELICOPTER REPLACEMENT PROGRAM

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:13.625
AND THE- EMERGENCY SURGE

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:18.130
CAPACITY THAT'S- OF BEING SOUGHT

02:12:18.196 --> 02:12:20.198
. I AND I HAVE TO SAY I'M A

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:21.800
GRATEFUL TO SEE THIS PROGRAM

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:24.269
MOVING ALONG IT WAS- NOT LONG

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:26.471
AFTER I ARRIVED AND BEGAN

02:12:26.538 --> 02:12:29.241
CHAIRING. THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:33.412
WE IDENTIFIED THE- BADLY NEEDED

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:35.781
THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:39.951
NOW WELL UNDER WAY- BUT I'M NOT

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:42.954
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:47.793
BETWEEN- INCREASING OUR FLEET BY

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:50.529
TWO HELICOPTERS- AND THE NOTION

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:53.665
OF DOING THAT BUT LIMITING IT TO

02:12:53.732 --> 02:12:56.234
EMERGENCY SURGE CAPACITY I JUST

02:12:56.301 --> 02:12:59.271
DON'T GET THE DIFFERENCE I CAN

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:01.573
UNDERSTAND I AM UNDER THE

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.709
ASSUMPTION THAT. OF THESE

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:04.910
HELICOPTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:06.745
IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THEM AT

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.080
ALL THEY HAVE TO HAVE CREWS

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:10.015
AVAILABLE AND IF WE'RE HIRING

02:13:10.082 --> 02:13:11.817
CRUISE WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:14.586
AVAILABLE IN THE SAME FASHION AS

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.288
EVERY OTHER GROUP FOR ALL THE

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:18.390
OTHER HELICOPTERS I THINK

02:13:18.457 --> 02:13:23.428
ULTIMATELY- AND PERHAPS YOU CAN-

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:25.030
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:28.767
THE- DEMAND FOR SERVICE. IS

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:31.203
GOING TO BE WHAT DETERMINES THE

02:13:31.269 --> 02:13:34.673
USE OF THESE HELICOPTERS AND I

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.475
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT- THE

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:40.345
NOTION OF SEARCH CAPACITY- OR OF

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:44.249
OR OF USING THEM IN A SEARCH-

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:46.017
SITUATION BUT- IF WE NEED THE

02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:48.320
HELICOPTERS- BUT WHY WOULD WE-

02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:50.155
WHY WOULD WE LIMIT THEM TO THAT

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:51.723
ROLE WE DON'T LIMIT WE DO

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:55.794
SEARCH. NOW WHY WOULD WE WANT TO

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:58.497
LIMIT FUTURE HELICOPTERS TO- TO

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:01.967
ONLY THAT MISSION. SIR THANK YOU

OF THE TEN BASES TWENTY FOUR

02:14:44.342 --> 02:14:46.178
HOURS A DAY- IN THE REASON WE

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:48.613
DID SO WAS BECAUSE- FIVE OF

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.648
THOSE HELICOPTERS WOULD HAVE

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:50.982
TANKS AND FIVE OF THOSE

02:14:51.049 --> 02:14:52.551

FLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND

02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:11.169
THIS IS WHERE YOU SEE SEARCH

SUPPLEMENT THOSE INCREASED OURS

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:08.393
IN THE FIRST TEN HELICOPTERS- TO

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.861
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FIREHAWK

ADDITION TO THAT- THOSE

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.271
HELICOPTERS THAT WOULD INITIALLY

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:20.772
BE BASED OUT OF MCCLELLAN HERE

02:16:20.839 --> 02:16:23.141
IN SACRAMENTO- COULD BE MOVED

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:24.342

HAVE. THROUGH STAFFING PATTERNS

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.147
ENOUGH WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WERE

02:16:29.214 --> 02:16:30.615
FLYING THEM WHEN WE HAVE

02:16:30.682 --> 02:16:32.384
CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:33.218
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:36.288

HELICOPTERS THAT WERE- COMING

02:16:45.096 --> 02:16:49.100

IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WITH A SENSE

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:02.480
OF. PRIDE IN THE EXPECTATION

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:04.883
THAT WE WERE GOING FROM- FLEET

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.618

THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO I HAVE TO

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:14.826
SAY IT COMES AS A BIT OF A

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:18.430
SURPRISE TO ME THAT- THAT. THAT

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:19.998
THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE AND-

02:17:20.065 --> 02:17:23.835
BABY- I NEED TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:25.070

02:17:25.136 --> 02:17:26.571
YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THE-

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:29.908

CAPACITY- TO THE EXTENT WE CAN

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.449
WITH AND- OF THE REASONABLE

02:17:37.515 --> 02:17:39.718
LIMITS OF THE BUDGET- BECAUSE

THESE- A CRAFTER ARE ARE SO

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:45.690
IMPORTANT. HI SO I DEFINITELY

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:46.891
WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN BUT I

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:48.360
WANT TO SEE THEM USED TO THEIR

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:49.828
MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY AS WELL

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.563
SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:54.933
HEADED- BUT MAYBE NOT WHERE WE

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.669

FORWARD THINKING- AND SOMETHING

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:16.087
THAT I'VE I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF

02:18:16.154 --> 02:18:19.824
WONDERED AND THAT IS- AS AS WE

02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:22.127
MOVE FORWARD IN TIME AND AS WE

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:25.764
SEE THE NEED FOR. ADVANCED THE

02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:29.200
TECHNOLOGY AND AN AIRCRAFT AND

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:32.070
SO FORTH IT. HI CAN YOU

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:36.574
CORRECTLY- BUT I AM I AM OF THE

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:39.411
BELIEF THAT THEIR- HERE IN

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:42.514
CALIFORNIA- TEXAS WHERE THERE'S

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:47.385
ALSO A LOT OF- AIRCRAFT- THAT

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:49.454
ARE USED- AROUND THE COUNTRY

02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:51.356
OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE WORLD

02:18:51.423 --> 02:18:53.825
THERE'S A- ONGOING AND

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:56.795
INCREASING NEED FOR- A

02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:58.797
FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT TO FULFILL

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:01.733
VERY VERY. SPECIFIC MISSION YES

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:03.835
IT'S MY UDERSTANDING THAT

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:06.738
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE AIRCRAFT

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:09.674
THAT IS DESIGNED FROM THE BOTTOM

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:12.310
UP. TO FIGHT FIRES IN SPITE OF

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:14.979
THIS GREAT NEED- WHEREAS AT

02:19:15.046 --> 02:19:16.881
LEAST IN A MILITARY CONTEXT-

02:19:16.948 --> 02:19:18.983
THERE ARE- AIRCRAFT THAT ARE

02:19:19.050 --> 02:19:20.318
FREQUENTLY BUILT FROM THE GROUND

02:19:20.385 --> 02:19:24.856
UP TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC MILITARY

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:27.792
MISSION SO- WOULD YOU AGREE WITH

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:29.794
ME THAT SOMETHING'S GONNA AND I

02:19:29.861 --> 02:19:31.563
REALIZE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:32.464
DEVELOPMENT OF AIRCRAFT WE'RE

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.766
TALKING ABOUT. TEN TWENTY THIRTY

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:38.269
YEAR- TIMELINES FOR DELIVERY OF

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:41.306
ACTUALLY ACTUAL PRODUCT BUT- I

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:42.941
THINK WE CAN PROJECT OUT THAT

02:19:43.007 --> 02:19:46.411
FAR IN TERMS OF- OF- THE CLIMATE

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:49.047
CRISIS AND THE NEED FOR FIGHTING

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:51.583
FIRES- AND PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:55.220
BE- LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT

02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:58.523
WAY. RATHER THAN. KINKA

02:19:58.590 --> 02:19:59.724
EQUIPMENT THAT'S AVAILABLE OFF

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:01.526
THE SHELF AND ADAPTING THEM BUT

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:04.062
LONG TERM MAYBE- LOOKING AT

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:05.663
STARTING TO DESIGN EQUIPMENT

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.632
FROM THE GROUND UP BUT WE SEE SO

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:09.367
MUCH OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:20:09.434 --> 02:20:12.804
ACTUALLY DOES- A ADDRESS TO FIRE

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:15.340
ISSUE IN THAT WAY. ABSOLUTELY

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:16.808
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:19.944
AS WELL SO- SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:20:20.011 --> 02:20:21.279
CORRECT WHEN WE LOOK AT ROTARY

02:20:21.346 --> 02:20:22.781
WING- OR HELICOPTERS

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:26.184
SPECIFICALLY- I CAN'T THANK YOU

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:28.419
ALL ENOUGH FOR INVESTING IN THE

02:20:28.486 --> 02:20:29.821
S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTER PROGRAM

02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:31.356
IS THE FIRST TIME THAT

02:20:31.422 --> 02:20:32.056
CALIFORNIA'S HAD A BRAND NEW

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.892
HELICOPTER. BROUGHT INTO THE

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:36.261
FLEET- AND WE SEE THAT A FEW

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:37.562
AREAS ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:41.166
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- SO MUCH

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:41.733
APPRECIATE THERE WHEN WE'RE

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.735
STARTING TO LOOK AT A FIXED

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:46.304
WING. AIR TANKERS- YOU KNOW

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:47.372
HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:49.240
THOSE BETWEEN WHAT IS STATE

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:50.241
OWNED AND WHAT IS PRIVATELY

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:52.677
OWNED. ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.712
THE NATION YOU ARE CORRECT THERE

02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:57.782
ARE LARGELY IN PART AT REVISED

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:58.850
AIRCRAFT FROM DIFFERENT AREAS OF

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:01.152
TIME. THAT A RETROFITTING AND-

02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:03.521
BY PRIVATE VENDORS- TO MEET THE

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:05.056
NEEDS OF OTHER WILDLAND

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.658
FIREFIGHTING MISSION ACROSS THE

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:09.227
STATE ACROSS THE NATION- WHETHER

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:12.630
THAT BE- ARE CURRENTLY THE BEST

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:15.266
U. T. GRAHAM AND- AIR TANKERS

02:21:15.333 --> 02:21:16.668
THAT WERE REALLY WORLD WAR TWO

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:18.036
SUBMARINE HUNTERS. THE

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:20.004
REPLACEMENT OF THE U. H. ONE H.

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:20.772
HELICOPTERS THAT WERE USED IN

02:21:20.839 --> 02:21:24.175
VIETNAM- WORDS SAYING RETROFITS

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:29.414
OF- JETLINERS. AND OUR TANKS ARE

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.115
BEING ADDED AND THEY'RE ALL VERY

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:32.817
QUALITY AIRCRAFT THERE RE

02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:34.619
UTILIZED AND I REMEMBER AS CHAIR

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:35.854
BLOOM WHENWE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.655
C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM- SOME

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:39.557
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THAT THIS

02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:40.992
WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU

02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:42.227
ASKED WAS WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO

02:21:42.293 --> 02:21:43.795
BUILD AN AIR TANKER FROM THE

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:44.863
GROUND UP SO WE HAD DONE THAT

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:46.898
RESEARCH INITIALLY. AND A

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:49.167
LOCKHEED MARTIN AT THE TIME WAS-

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:52.437
OFFERING A BRAND NEW- C. ONE

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:55.373
THIRTY J. MODEL- AIRCRAFT- WITH

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:57.308
A BASE PRICE OF ABOUT EIGHTY

02:21:57.375 --> 02:21:59.410
EIGHT POINT FIVE. MILLION

02:21:59.477 --> 02:22:01.646
DOLLARS TO GET OFF THE GROUND

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.514
AND I THINK THAT AS WE CONTINUE

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:04.182
TO MOVE FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:07.085
LOOK AT. WHAT THE NEEDS OF OUR

02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:08.887
GREAT STATE- WE NEED TO START

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:12.290
LOOKING AT OPTIONS OF WHETHER

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:16.394
CONTINUING. TO RE UTILIZE

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:17.462
AIRCRAFT WERE TO YOU- PURCHASE

02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:21.466
NEW AS YOU SEE BACK. WELL I

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:22.300
THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:25.503
THINK- I'D LIKE TO AGAIN HAVE

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:26.804
THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN WITH

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:34.913
YOU- IF. GETTING THAT- OF IT

02:22:34.979 --> 02:22:36.147
GETTING FORWARD MOVEMENT ON

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:38.249
THAT- A TYPE OF A PROJECT-

02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:41.252
REQUIRE SOME- HELP THE FROM THE

02:22:41.319 --> 02:22:42.453
SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.856
BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT AND AGAIN

02:22:44.923 --> 02:22:47.525
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE- THE

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:49.193
SPECIFIC ANSWERS HERE AND WHAT

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.695
THAT AIRCRAFT WOULD LOOK LIKE

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:54.032
BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO- PARTNER

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.633
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:59.704
BECAUSE THESE THIS WOULD BE A- I

02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:02.206
DO KNOW THE DESIGNING AIRCRAFT-

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:05.543
IS A VERY VERY- EXPENSIVE AND

02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:08.146
LABOR INTENSIVE. PROPOSITION SO

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:10.515
IF SOMETHING IS TO TALK ABOUT-

02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:13.718
THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE A- IS A

02:23:13.785 --> 02:23:17.455
ASKING FOR A FOLLOW UP TO- THE

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:19.857
L. A. O.'S COMMENT ABOUT THE-

02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:21.893
VEHICLE LOCATOR PROGRAM IN THE

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:24.896
EXPANSION FROM TWELVE HUNDRED TO

02:23:24.963 --> 02:23:26.931
THIRTY SIX HUNDRED VEHICLES- I

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:28.132
GUESS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

02:23:28.199 --> 02:23:31.669
IS. WHY DOES EVERY VEHICLE IN

02:23:31.736 --> 02:23:34.238
THE FLEET NEED TO HAVE THAT

02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:39.344
TECHNOLOGY ADDED- WHEN ONLY A- I

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:40.611
. IT'S NOT A SMALL FRACTION BUT

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:43.614
ONLY A FRACTION OF THE- VEHICLES

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:45.583
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ACTUALLY.

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:48.920
BE OUT IN THE FIELD THE IN THOSE

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:50.254
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU NEED THAT.

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:53.591
CAPABILITY I THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:55.893
QUESTION AS WELL- CHERRY BLOOM-

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:58.596
SO AS YOU KNOW ACCOUNT BY REALLY

02:23:58.663 --> 02:24:01.099
IS A TOTAL FORCE CONCEPT AND

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:07.505
WHEN WE WERE- GRATEFUL TO HAVE-THIS APPROVED IN THE FISCAL YEAR

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:08.039
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN A BUDGET

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:10.842
CYCLE- B. INITIAL PHASE WAS IN

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:12.844
FACT THE TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.579
APART ACROSS TWELVE HUNDRED

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:16.114
VEHICLES WHICH WERE THE FRONT

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:16.647
LINE VEHICLES ACROSS STATE

02:24:16.714 --> 02:24:19.017
CALIFORNIA- FOR CALIFORNIA-

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.585
SPECIFICALLY THEY HAVE AUTOMATIC

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:22.286
VEHICLE LOCATION AS WELL AS A

02:24:22.353 --> 02:24:24.789
MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. LOCATED

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:26.991
WITHIN THE VEHICLE- THAT ALLOWS

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:30.495
US TO SEND INFORMATION TO THE

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:32.230
OCCUPANTS OF THE THOSE VEHICLES

02:24:32.296 --> 02:24:35.833
WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:38.569
THEIR- FOR THEIR INCIDENT NOW WE

02:24:38.636 --> 02:24:42.140
KNOW THAT- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY

02:24:42.206 --> 02:24:43.041
THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED VEHICLES IN

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.275
THE FLEET. THIS TWENTY FOUR

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:47.412
HUNDRED- WOULD ADD A TOTAL OF

02:24:47.478 --> 02:24:49.013
THIRTY SIX THERE ARE CERTAINLY

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:49.647
VEHICLES WITHIN THE FLEET THAT

02:24:49.714 --> 02:24:53.084
WOULD NOT HAVE- ABL AND NDTV'S

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:54.252
PLACED ON THEM OF COURSE THOSE

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:55.586
ARE LARGELY CONSTRUCTION

02:24:55.653 --> 02:24:56.821
EQUIPMENT TRAILERS AND THINGS OF

02:24:56.888 --> 02:24:58.389
THE SORT THAT WE WOULDN'T

02:24:58.456 --> 02:25:00.058
REASONABLY EXPECT THOSE TO BE.

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:02.060
PLACED ON THOSE VEHICLES BUT

02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:04.128
IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT- OF THE

02:25:04.195 --> 02:25:05.329
DIFFERENCE OF THAT OF KNOWING

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.432
THAT- THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE

02:25:07.498 --> 02:25:09.634
UNITS THAT ARE READY TO BE

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.169
INSTALLED IN A BRAND NEW VEHICLE

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:12.637
IT'S GOING OUT TO THE FIELD IS

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:14.472
AN OLD VEHICLE COMES IN FOR

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:17.008
SURVEY- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT.

02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:20.378
REMOVED EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS-

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:22.046
THAT VEHICLES HAVE TO GO IN FOR

02:25:22.113 --> 02:25:24.582
MAINTENANCE- VEHICLES ARE PLACED

02:25:24.649 --> 02:25:25.616
OUT OF SERVICE AND WHEN WE DO

02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:28.319
THAT- WE PLACE RESERVE APPARATUS

02:25:28.386 --> 02:25:29.921
OR SURGEON HORRENDOUS AS WE

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:30.621
TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS

02:25:30.688 --> 02:25:33.791
PROPOSAL- IN THE SERVICE AND IT

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:36.260
ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS POLLING- THE-

02:25:36.327 --> 02:25:38.763
THE A. B. L. N. M. B. T. UNITS.

02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:40.031
OUT OF ONE VEHICLE AND PLACING

02:25:40.098 --> 02:25:41.632
IT INTO ANOTHER THEIR PARMALEE

02:25:41.699 --> 02:25:44.202
HARD MOUNTED- UNITS WITHIN EACH

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:46.070
OF THOSE VEHICLES. NOW WHEN WE

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:47.638
LOOK AT ALL THE VEHICLES ACROSS

02:25:47.705 --> 02:25:48.539
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN

02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.441
GOING BACK TO TOTAL FORCE I'LL

02:25:50.508 --> 02:25:51.909
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- DURING THE

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:53.778
CALAR FIRES THE FIRE BURNED OVER

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:56.080
THE TOP. OF ECHO SUMMIT IN THE

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:58.583
LAKE TAHOE REASONABLY ONE WOULD

02:25:58.649 --> 02:26:00.518
THINK THAT ME MYSELF AND MY

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:02.954
VEHICLE WOULDN'T NEED- A MOBILE

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.790
DATA TERMINAL OR- AVIELLE. YET

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:07.759
IN FACT I WAS SITTING ON THE

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:09.060
ECHO SUMMIT AS THE FIRE BLEW

02:26:09.127 --> 02:26:11.162
OVER THE TOP AND WENT DOWN INTO

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:11.796
CHRISTMAS VALLEY AND THE LAKE

02:26:11.863 --> 02:26:15.466
TAHOE BASIN- LIKEWISE- ONE MIGHT

02:26:15.533 --> 02:26:17.969
QUESTION WHY- VEHICLES SUCH AS

02:26:18.035 --> 02:26:19.637
THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:22.306
MIGHT NEED- BOTTOM OUT OF

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:24.075
VEHICLE LOCATION AND HE'D M. D.

T. ON A SCAN TO. OTHER VEHICLES

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:29.213
THAT WE USE- THOSE FOLKS ON THE

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.348
CRITICAL FUNCTION OF DAMAGE

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:31.782
ASSESSMENT WHEN WE PUT THEM OUT

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:38.456
ON THE FIRE LINE TO ASSESS- BURN. DAMAGE AND DESTROYED

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:39.023
STRUCTURES- WHY. A RESOURCE

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:40.324
MANAGEMENT- WILL. GO OUT AN

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:41.125
ANSWER AND PER MULTIPLE

02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:42.793
FUNCTIONS IN INCIDENT COMMAND

WATERSHED ASSESSMENT AND- POST-

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:53.671
POST FIRE- VIOLENT SUPPRESSION

REPAIR. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:57.542
US AS LEADERS IN THE

02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.910
ORGANIZATION AS INCIDENT

COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND. TO

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:01.846
ENSURE THAT WE KNOW. THE

LOCATION OF. ALL OF THESE

02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:06.350
RESOURCES ON THE INCIDENT FOR

ACCOUNTABILITY BEING ABLE TO PRE

02:27:08.152 --> 02:27:10.354
POSITION THEM OR MOVE THEM INTO

02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:11.189
OTHER AREAS WHERE FIRE MAY BE

02:27:11.255 --> 02:27:14.392
GOING. BY WATCHING THEM ON ON A

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:18.362
MAP. ACTIVE ACTIVELY THERE. AS

02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:20.031
WELL AS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:21.098
THE INITIAL ATTACK ACTIVITY

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:22.967
AGAIN BEING IN A RESERVE

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:26.270
APPARATUS- YOU MIGHT FIND. THAT

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:28.039
THAT RESERVE APPARATUS IS MOVING

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:29.307
WITHIN THEIR FIRE DISTRICT MAY

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:30.374
BE CLOSER TO ANOTHER FIRE

02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:32.410
DISTRICT AND THEREFORE DYNAMIC

02:27:32.476 --> 02:27:34.245
DISPATCHING WILL ALWAYS DISPATCH

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:36.080
THE CLOSEST RESOURCE REGARDLESS

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.014
OF WHETHER IT'S A FRONT LINE

02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:38.716
RESOURCES BEING STAFF WERE

02:27:38.783 --> 02:27:40.484
RESERVE APPARATUS. I HOPE THAT

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:44.922
HELPS. IT DOES THANK YOU- I'M

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:47.024
SURE- ON A STAFF LEVEL THEY'LL

02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:50.161
PROBABLY BE MARK- QUESTIONS-

02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:51.329
ABOUT THAT IT WOULD BE

02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:55.967
INTERESTING ENOUGH THERE'S- DATA

02:27:56.033 --> 02:27:58.269
AVAILABLE WITH THE- WITH RESPECT

02:27:58.336 --> 02:28:00.004
TO THE USAGE OF VEHICLES AS YOU

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:03.808
AS YOU REFER TO- THAT MIGHT BE

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:05.810
DIFFICULT TO COMBAT THAT WOULD

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:08.746
BE INTERESTING TO SAY- ARE THERE

02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:11.249
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:15.386
BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:17.488
JOURNALISM- NUMBER ONE JUST IN

02:28:17.555 --> 02:28:19.056
THE QUICKEST I WASN'T PLANNING

02:28:19.123 --> 02:28:20.324
ON THIS BUT WHEN YOU MADE THE

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:23.728
COMMENT ABOUT- PLANNING- FIRE

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:25.529
CRAFT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.031
AIRCRAFT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:28.332
FIGHT FIRES WILDLAND FIRES IN

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:30.334
PARTICULAR- IT'S A GREAT

02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:34.005
QUESTION AND I THINK- GIVEN- THE

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.573
DIRECTION OF- WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.310
WITH THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA DID

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:40.745
DOES MAKE SOME SENSE FOR US TO

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.213
PAY SOME ATTENTION THAT I WOULD

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.282
LIKE TO PASS ON AN EXPERIENCE I

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:47.151
HAD WHEN I WAS IN ITALY- ONE A-

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:51.589
FIRE BROKE OUT. I WATCHED TANKER

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.658
AFTER TANKER. AND THERE MUST

02:28:53.724 --> 02:28:55.393
HAVE BEEN T AT LEAST A DOZEN OF

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:56.827
THEM AND THEY WERE FLYING IN A-

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:59.563
HUGE PATTERN- ONE WOULD COME

02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:01.999
DOWN AND LITERALLY FILL IN THE

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:05.369
OCEAN. THE TANKER ITSELF CAME.

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:07.471
HIT THE OCEAN. AND THE

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:09.540
ACCELERATED AS HARD AS I COULD

02:29:09.607 --> 02:29:11.042
AND THEY WERE PICKING UP WATER.

02:29:11.108 --> 02:29:12.610
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:14.745
WAS AN AIRCRAFT THAT WAS ADAPTED

02:29:14.812 --> 02:29:16.347
FOR BUT IF IT WAS ADAPTED IT

02:29:16.414 --> 02:29:18.382
WAS. PRETTY MAJOR ADAPTION SO

02:29:18.449 --> 02:29:19.817
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:21.552
WERE DOING IN ITALY TEN YEARS

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.788
AGO- AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:26.190
RAPIDLY ONE LANDED THEN THE NEXT

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:27.358
ONE WOULD COME AND THEY WERE

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:28.893
JUST MAKING A CIRCLE RIGHT OVER

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.194
THE FIRES GIVEN THAT OUR

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:32.096
PROXIMITY TO THE COAST. AND HOW

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.464
MANY OF OUR FIRES OF THAT WAYS

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:34.865
OF THAT MAYBE SOME AIRCRAFT THAT

02:29:34.932 --> 02:29:36.701
WE- THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

02:29:36.767 --> 02:29:38.069
DESIGNED FOR THE BOTTOM- BUT I

02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:40.304
DON'T KNOW OF OR WAS AT THE

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:42.039
ADOPTED IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE

02:29:42.106 --> 02:29:44.041
ALMOST LIKE. C. ONE THIRTY THERE

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.377
WERE ADOPTED WITH THEIR- WITH

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:47.545
THAT WITH THE SCOOP IN FRONT

02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:49.780
RATHER THAN THAT AND BACK- SO I

02:29:49.847 --> 02:29:55.419
JUST OFFER THAT BUT- YOU KNOW.

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:56.620
THE HEARING ABOUT THE- AND I

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:57.455
DON'T KNOW IF PRONOUNCING THIS

02:29:57.521 --> 02:29:59.457
BUT THE FOR. SYSTEM THE IN THIS

02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:01.092
- RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT'S OUT

02:30:01.158 --> 02:30:05.763
THERE- HI HI I AM- AT- HE- DID

02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:07.365
NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS WHOLE

02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:10.034
FIELD OF. WILDFIRE PREVENTION

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:11.736
EXCITER BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

02:30:11.802 --> 02:30:13.804
FROM A COMMON SENSE STANDPOINT.

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:16.374
THAT IF WE COULD ATTACK THESE

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.209
THINGS RIGHT WHEN THEY START.

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:19.710
AND REALLY BRING A LOT OF

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:23.214
RESOURCES. OF WE COULD SAVE A

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.251
LOT OF. PROPERTY A LOT OF RISK

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:30.388
EXPENSE AND TREMENDOUS ENERGY-

02:30:30.454 --> 02:30:32.323
AND CHILL OVERALL I'M VERY

02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:35.359
INTERESTED IN- THE INITIAL

02:30:35.426 --> 02:30:38.429
RESPONSE- BEING OF BECOMING MORE

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:40.664
ROBUST BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP AT

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:43.367
ACROSS THE STATE- AND SO

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:45.369
GENERALLY- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:48.706
THIS. BUT IT DOES I THINK- LEAD

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:51.008
ME TO THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:52.810
STRATEGIC PLAN THAT STAFF WAS

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:55.279
REFERRING TO AND THAT IS- AS AS

02:30:55.346 --> 02:30:57.448
A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:59.817
PLAN. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:01.886
RESOURCES WHAT. WHAT PART OF THE

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:05.156
PLAN HOW HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS

02:31:05.222 --> 02:31:07.892
ADDITIONAL- RESPONSE RAPID

02:31:07.958 --> 02:31:10.327
RESPONSE IN IN AN OVERALL

02:31:10.394 --> 02:31:12.663
STRATEGIC PLAN AND HOW ROBUST

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.732
SHOULD IT BE- HOW MUCH GAIN

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:16.367
WOULD WE GET THERE ON ONE HAND

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:17.802
VERSUS THE OTHER. AND SO MY

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:19.970
QUESTION FOR CAL FIRE IS CAL

02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:21.672
FIRE OPPOSED TO CREATING A

02:31:21.739 --> 02:31:23.207
STATEWIDE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:27.044
PLANNED- IN THE END IF NOT WHAT

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:30.848
ARE THE HURDLES- FOR ACTUALLY

02:31:30.915 --> 02:31:31.782
GETTING THAT DONE. AND IF THEY

02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:34.452
ARE WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:31:34.518 --> 02:31:35.986
THEY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO IT. NO

02:31:36.053 --> 02:31:37.054
WELL THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:38.923
THAT AND I'M GONNA DRESSES AND

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:41.292
INTO PIECES FIRST AND FOREMOST-

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:43.694
THE STREET THE STREET SHE

02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:45.262
TRISTIQUE FIRE PLAN FOR THE

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:47.064
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WAS LAST

02:31:47.131 --> 02:31:48.532
PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND

02:31:48.599 --> 02:31:49.233
EIGHTEEN BY THE BOARD OF

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:51.202
FORESTRY OWNER FRANK TODAY ABOUT

02:31:51.268 --> 02:31:52.603
THE STRATEGIC FIRE PLAN REACH

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:54.472
WERE REFERRING TO. WHAT WAS

02:31:54.538 --> 02:31:56.006
ASKED OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:57.908
PROVIDED TO THEM RELATED TO

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:59.844
RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND- AND THE

02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:01.712
STRATEGIC THINKING OR STANDARD

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:03.514
TO COVER OF WHAT WE WOULD HEAR.

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:06.183
FROM A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS ON

02:32:06.250 --> 02:32:08.185
HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO GET

02:32:08.252 --> 02:32:09.987
THEM THERE THE QUICKEST. FOR

02:32:10.054 --> 02:32:10.855
AIRCRAFT IN THE STATE OF

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:12.490
CALIFORNIA WE ALREADY HAVE THAT

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:13.491
IN PLACE FOR AIRCRAFT

02:32:13.557 --> 02:32:15.092
SPECIFICALLY IT'S OUR GOAL TO

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:16.594
HAVE AN INITIAL SACK AIRCRAFT

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:17.795
OVER ANY FIRE IN THE STATE OF

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:19.396
CALIFORNIA. WITHIN TWENTY

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:21.131
MINUTES AND REASONABLY I THINK

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:23.067
BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL

02:32:23.133 --> 02:32:24.702
PARTNERS WE DO AN EXCELLENT JOB

02:32:24.768 --> 02:32:26.103
WITH THAT WE CAN ALWAYS CONTINUE

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:30.074
TO IMPROVE- AND SO FROM A- AIR

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:32.543
TANKER. HELICOPTER PERSPECTIVE I

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:33.944
THINK WE'RE GOOD THERE. SO WHAT

02:32:34.011 --> 02:32:36.113
THE- PROGRAM REALLY FOCUSES ON

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:38.516
IS- AND WHAT THE REPORT COULD

02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:41.785
FOCUS ON LARGELY IS- THE

02:32:41.852 --> 02:32:49.994
ALLOCATION OF ENGINES CREWS- AND. BULLDOZERS- YEAH AND FROM THAT

02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:50.761
ACCOUNT ARE CERTAINLY IS NOT

02:32:50.828 --> 02:32:52.162
OPPOSED IT- WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:32:52.229 --> 02:32:53.497
THE REPORT WAS DUE BY APRIL

02:32:53.564 --> 02:32:54.899
FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. BUT

02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:57.167
AS WE ALL KNOW AND WITH WITH ALL

02:32:57.234 --> 02:33:00.237
RESPECT- WE WERE DRAFTING THAT

02:33:00.304 --> 02:33:03.007
REPORT- BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:03.974
COMPLETE IT TO THE LEVEL IN

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:06.544
WHICH WE FELT IT WAS A READY TO

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:08.679
BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:09.280
IN THE ADMINISTRATION. LARGELY

02:33:09.346 --> 02:33:10.848
BECAUSE WE DIVERTED OUR

02:33:10.915 --> 02:33:12.883
ATTENTION IN FEBRUARY OF TWO

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:14.318
THOUSAND TWENTY- COMMITTING

02:33:14.385 --> 02:33:15.619
LARGE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES A

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:18.255
PART OF THE- LARGER STATE

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:19.290
CALIFORNIA PLAN TO THE COVE IN

02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:22.826
PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION TO THAT-

02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:23.794
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWENTY

02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:25.029
ONE WHERE LARGE COMET JING AND

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.630
DISASTERS FIRE YEARS AND WE KNOW

02:33:26.697 --> 02:33:28.632
THE CAL FIRE'S CRITICALLY. SHORT

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:30.634
WITH IT STOPPING RIGHT NOW I AM

02:33:30.701 --> 02:33:33.370
COMMITTED WITH MY PARTNERS- TO

02:33:33.437 --> 02:33:36.740
REESTABLISH AND- AND BRING FOR

02:33:36.807 --> 02:33:40.344
THIS PLAN FOR YOU. I INTO THE

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:43.614
FUTURE. THANK YOU- MY- OTHER

02:33:43.681 --> 02:33:46.951
QUESTION IS- WITH REGARDING THE-

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.919
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY

02:33:48.986 --> 02:33:50.921
AND TO THE- THIRTY SIX HUNDRED

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:54.091
VEHICLES- I TRIED TO DO SOME OF

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:56.961
THE ANALYSIS OF THE COST- AND-

02:33:57.027 --> 02:33:59.196
HE- CAN YOU EITHER. YEAH I DO

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.731

02:34:00.798 --> 02:34:03.500
VEHICLE- OR CAN YOU GET THAT TO
