GOOD AFTERNOON I'M NEW TO THIS CUSTOMER MADE A SENSE OF CHEER MENTIONED I'M THE SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOT IT ALL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLAN I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF SECOND HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSALS INCLUDING ISSUES FIVE EIGHTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA AT THAT ARE BUILT ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY MUST INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. A CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLAN IS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THE PLAN PROPOSES HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR THE FULL DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND WITH A FOCUS ON RACIAL EQUITY. IT PRESENTS A BOLD PROPOSAL TO SCALE HOME KEY WHICH IS BEING ADOPTED BY OTHER STATES AND ALSO COURSE BY OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AFTER NATIONAL MODEL. THE PLAN ALSO ADVANCES A COMPREHENSIVE IN MULTI PRONGED APPROACH THAT SEEKS TO END FAMILY HOMELESSNESS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH INVOLVES WORKING CLOSELY AND IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR AGENCY AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND IT HONORS A FACT THAT WILL PERMANENT HOUSING AND THE NECESSARY SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ARE THE ONLY TRUE SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF UNSHELTERED CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FACING URGENT AND DANGEROUS SITUATIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY WHO NEED OUR SUPPORT WITH A FOCUS INVESTMENTS IN ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION EFFORTS. THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS PLAN ALSO CALLS ATTENTION TO ACCOUNTABILITY WITH A PROPOSAL TO CONDUCT ANY LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL HOMELESSNESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND STATE FUNDED HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. ON HOUSING PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IS FOREMOST IN THE MAY REVISION. THE PLAN ENVISIONS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT WILL EXPEDITE THE CONSTRUCTION OF SHOVEL READY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WILL ALSO PRESERVE THOUSANDS OF EXISTING UNITS REACHING THE END OF THEIR AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS. AND THAT ALSO MAKES HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE THE LIVEABILITYAT THE H. C. D.'S MIGRANT FARMWORKER HOUSING. INVESTING IN OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK ESPECIALLY FOR OUR ESSENTIAL MIGRANT FARM WORKERS. WHO'VE LABORED NONSTOP DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS CRITICAL. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST THANK YOU AGAIN SHARE COMMENT YET ALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I REALLY APPRECIATED THE TIME THAT WE SPENT TOGETHER VISITING THE KING CITY MIGRANT CENTER EARLIER THIS MONTH. THE CALIFORNIA COME IN COME BACK PLAN. THE LICENSE HOUSEHOLDS AND PREVENTS DISPLACEMENT BY PROVIDING DIRECT RELIEF TO RENTERS LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS THROUGH EXPANDED RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THROUGH FORECLOSURE PREVENTION MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE AND HOME BUYER DON DOWN PAYMENT SUPPORT. THE PLAN SEEKS TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS TO EXPAND HOMEOWNERSHIP IN EIGHTEEN YOU FINANCING FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LOCKED OUT OF DEBT FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PRIORITISES OUR STATED GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. WE KNOW THAT PLANNING WITH COMMUNITIES AROUND SUSTAINABLE LIVING IT'S IMPORTANT TO MEETING THIS GOAL AND THEREFORE THE PLAN PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT. AND PROVIDE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS FOR REGIONAL ENTITIES TO CARRY OUT COMPREHENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING PROJECTS. THESE COMBINED HOUSING INVESTMENTS COUPLED WITH THE STRATEGIES AND THE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WILL HELP UNLOCK AT LEAST FORTY SIX THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS AND HOUSING PLACEMENTS. COLLECTIVELY THESE APPROACHES ADVANCE THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO EXPAND HOUSING ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY INCREASES IN HOUSING PRODUCTION STRENGTHENING ACCOUNTABILITY AND FACILITATING EXPEDIENCY. ALL WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY. IN CONCLUSION THE CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLAN LEAST A FOUNDATION OR AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND BUILDS UPON THE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR A TOTAL HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE OF TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION IN A HOUSING PACKAGE OF NINE POINT THREE BILLION. AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO RECOVER AND BOLSTER LONG TERM EQUITY AND RESILIENCY. AND WE'LL BUILD UPON OUR CURRENT MOMENTUM AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE ON HOUSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. I AM JOINED TODAY BY THE COLLEAGUES BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- BY MY TEAM TO PROVIDE SUMMARIES OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL THAT IS INCLUDED IN TODAY'S COMMITTEE AGENDA. I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE AND- SHORTLY BUT MY TEAM WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU ON THAT TOUR AND WAS VERY. VERY HELPFUL I THINK IN IN HELPING TO. UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF MIGRANT HOUSING- AND SO- APPRECIATE YOU TESTIFYING HERE TODAY MOVING ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. HE TALKS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO ADD AT THIS TIME. VERY GOOD- HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AFTERNOON THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I WILL BEGIN TODAY PROVIDING A FEW OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS BEFORE MAKING SOME MORE SPECIFIC COMMENTS. THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION CONTINUES TO RECOGNIZE THE STATE HMELESSNESS CHALLENGES ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND ARE WORTHWHILE GOALS. IN THE NAME OF THE GEN THE GOVERNOR SAYS THE GOAL TO FUNCTIONALLY AND FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND FIVE YEARS. TO DO SO HE INTRODUCES VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE ENTITIES. AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE SCHOOL. THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT IDENTIFY INTRUM GOALS TO MEASURE THE STATE'S PROGRESS TOWARDS FUNCTIONALLY ENDING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS IN FIVE YEARS. IN ADDITION FAMILY HOMELESSNESS IS ONE DIMENSION OF THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO ASSESS IF IT HAS COOLED AROUND OTHER DIMENSIONS OF HOMELESSNESS THE DISTRICT BASED HOMELESSNESS. AND HOW THE STATE'S BUDGET CAN HELP ADDRESS THESE GOALS. THE GOVERNOR SOME MAJOR HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS LARGELY EXPAND EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EXPAND SOME STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT OFFER HOUSING ASSISTANCE. RECNT BUDGETS HAVE PROVIDED FLEXIBLE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THEY CAN ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THE MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE THIS TYPE OF PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO ASSESS IF IT IS COMFORTABLE WITH THIS CHANGE OR WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBLE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO LOCALS. AS THE FUTURE OF THE STATE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE. TO WRAP UP MY GENERAL COMMENTS IN THE PASTORAL PROCESS RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION LAYS OUT ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH NOW THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO ASSESS IF IT CONCURS WITH THIS APPROACH WHETHER WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. TURNING TO THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S ANY REVISION. MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT WHICH IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THERE ARE VARIOUS OUTSTANDING IMPLEMENTATION CONSCIOUS QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH TRAILER ABOUT LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR ABOUT HOME HE INFORMED HOW THE PROPOSED THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING WOULD BE USED. AS AN EXAMPLE HOW COULD YOU FACILITATE THE USE OF A DIFFERENT MIX OF FACILITIES. AS HOTELS AND MOTELS MAY NOT BE AS READILY AVAILABLE FOR USE TO HOME KEY AT THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC SUBSIDE. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN RECENT BUDGETS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES MAJOR ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE HOW WILL PRESERVE THESE GAINS IN THE LONG TERM. IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF HUNKY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE PLANS FOR OPERATING SITES FOR FIVE YEARS. HELLO HOPE YOU SAID TO BE OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BEYOND THOSE FIVE YEARS IS UNCLEAR. THIS IS CERTAIN HE CAN MAKE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO PARTICIPATE OR COULD CREATE FISCAL PRESSURES FOR THE SEAT IN THE LONG TERM AS IT TRIES TO PROTECT HOME CAMPUS MONTHS. THE STATEMENT WANT TO CONSIDER HOW IT BALANCES CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. AND OPERATING COSTS WITHIN HOKEY. THE STATE'S ABILITY TO SPEND THE MAJOR APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE PROPOSED TIMELINES IN THE REVISION IS ALSO UNCLEAR. IN MANY CASES THE PROPOSE FUNDING IS MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY FOR PROGRAMS. IN PARTICULAR THE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING ACROSS TWO YEARS FOR HOCKEY. AND THE FUNDING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS. CAN RESCUE COMPANY IS AVAILABLE THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE CAN CHOOSE TO ALLOCATE A PORTION OF PROPOSED SPENDING. MORE CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH EXPECTED CAPACITY AND ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS LATER THIS WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE ADDITIONAL TIME TO MAKING POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT ITS APPROACH TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE STATE HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES. FOR SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ELECTRICITY LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER. TRADE LIBERAL TO MAKE SOME MOVES. ON TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KNOWN BARRIERS TO SET THESE PROGRAMS COULD EXPAND ACCESS AND ENHANCED ITS ABILITY TO SPEND THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS ACROSS MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS. IT WILL BE MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SET CLEAR EXPECTATIONS THROUGH. STATUTE AND BUDGET THE LANGUAGE ESTABLISHING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE STATE'S PROGRESS FOR DRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THESE PROPOSALS AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THEM. I DO DIGITAL- THOUGHTS AND GUIDANCE AT THE TRAILER BILL BECOMES AVAILABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS AND- INSIGHTFUL. SPECIFICITY PRECIADO VERY MUCH- LET ME SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DYESS. SENATOR NIELSEN. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AGENCY SECRETARY. LET'S SEE IF SHE'S STILL AVAILABLE. OR ANYBODY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. I DOUBT THAT THE SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE HOMELESS INSIDE AND WE HAVE OUR COLLEAGUES H. D. IF IT RELATES TO SOME OF THAT HOUSING PROPOSALS LATER IN THE AGENDA LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET. HER UP ON THE SCREEN. I THINK WE HAD THE SECRETARY BRIEFLY. AND I'M SURE YES I'M STILL HERE STILL HERE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATED YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I'D LIKE TO. A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC FROM BOTH THE FRONT END AND BACKEND. IN DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION. HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED PLANS FOR ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE COMING IN FOR THE SYSTEM TO BE ASSISTANT HERE WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS THAT ARE PUTTING THEM IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MANY OF THEM HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALCOHOL ABUSE. ILLNESSES THICKNESSES THAT ARE PERSISTING AND IF MY THOUGHT THAT. PROVIDING SHELTER IF YOU WILL IS NOT THE ANSWER IT'S PART OF THE HATCH BUT IT IS NOT THE ANSWER IN KIND OF THE CORE IS TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS AND WE'RE GOING TO HOUSE INDIVIDUALS CAN WE DO THAT AND ERRORS WERE IN THERE ARE SERVICES AVAILABLE YOU MENTIONED THE MADAM SECRETARY SERVICES. SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR SCOPE OF SERVICES THAT WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY AS WE PROVIDE HOUSING NOW THAT WOULD BE AT TE BACK END AT THE FRONT END RATHER AT THE BACK AND THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS. OF THIS PARTICULAR INVESTMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IT IS- DEFINITELY- PART OF OUR OVERALL APPROACH AND LET ME JUST START OFF BY. ANSWERING A FEW COMPONENTS- AND THEN I WILL TURN IT OVER TO A DEPUTY SECRETARY ALLEY SEVEN- DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND ALSO ASKED FINANCE IT BE LIKE TO CHIME IN ON TRUMP SPENT. THAT PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT SPEAK TO THE SERVICE SINCE- INVESTMENTS IN THE SERVICE COMPONENT. AT FIRST I WILL JUST SHARE- AS- I MENTIONED BRIEFLY IN MY REMARKS THAT. THE STATE HAS IN BEEN INVESTING- IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE. GOOD DATA PROPER DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE SCOPE OF HOMELESSNESS STANDARD TYPES OF HOMELESS. SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED- THROUGH THE FORTY FOUR CONTINUE ON SOME CROSS THE STATE ANSWERED TWO MONTHS AGO- ARE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. LAUNCH THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE STATE- THAT IS THE FIRST. OF ITS KIND IN TERMS OF A DATA WAREHOUSE. WHERE WE HAVE- FOR THE FIRST TIME A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM. OF THE TYPES OF SERVICES OUT OF THAT- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ACCIDENT SCENE. IT ALSO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE OUTCOMES- AND THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE WORKING. AT SO WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HAD SEEN. THE DATA AND THE BASS LINE WILL ENABLE US TO WORK MORE CLOSELYWITH COMMUNITIES- TO. LEARN ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT'S WORKING THE SCALE- THOSE PROGRAMS OR INITIATIVES THAT WORK. AND ALSO TO- TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ALSO WHEN ADVOCATING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHERE NECESSARY- BUT BUT FRANKLY I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- THE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS REQUIRES. A DEEP. INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING BUT IT ALSO WE'RE CHOIR SAID WE- INTO- THIS TO RESOURCE- NOW. TO ENSURE THAT IN. ARE FAMILY AND SAY MOVED IN. APARTMENT HOUSING BUYER. THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY AND TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO LET ME JUST ASK A DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS SALLY IF SHE'D LIKE TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS. YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO- A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THAT THE SERVICES BY- BUT I WOULD LIKE A CALL OUT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I KNOW THIS IS BEING HEARD IN A AND ANOTHER- SESSION LATER THIS WEEK BUT WE JUST MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE A HANDFUL. A PROPOSED X. TO AN APARTMENT SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT WOULD INCLUDE- HOUSING RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES. I WILL SPEND- I KIND OF TREND GOING STRONG AND THERE'S QUITE A FEW BUT WE JUST CAUGHT A COUPLE SPECIFIC ONE. RELATED TO THE FAMILY HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL THERE IS. A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND EXPANSION- PROPOSE FOR ARMS ARE HIGHLY DESIRED COLORS I THINK SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES THINGS LIKE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE- AS WELL AS A POINT OF REFERENCE SERVICES FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE HOMELESS AND ON CAL WORKS- THERE'S ALSO A- PROGRAM. EXPANSION FOR OUR MEDIUM IS HOME TO AROUND WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHICH WOULD ALSO HAVE. THE TIME TO WRAP AROUND SUPPORT SERVICES I HAD ANOTHER ONE I WOULD JUST CALL OUT. IN THE HOUSING DISABILITY. ADVOCACY PROGRAM THERE'S ALSO. A PROPOSED EXPANSION PACK FOR. WHICH IS VERY MUCH HARD AT- THAT ARE OUT. FOR ACCESS BY OUR ACTIONS. AND WHO AM I HOME AND A TO FOR OPEN. GET BACK PACKAGE YES WELL AS- AT HOUSING OR SO THERE IS. QUITE A FEW OF THESE ARE THAT WORKS TO NOW REALLY RATE AND HOW THEY SUPPORT AND I. SUPPORT SIR. AS THEY DON'T SEE- OF THOSE. WELL IT IS MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE KEY PIECES UP THE ACTUAL PROPOSED TAX PLAN IS ALSO AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY IF YOU'RE GOING AROUND. HI HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE STAFF IS EXCITED ABOUT YOUR TRADE TALKS EXTENSIVELY ABOUT EACH YEAH I ASK. THE MEDIA MIGHT ALSO PROPOSES FIVE. POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOME OF BIRMINGHAM FINANCING COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR EARNINGS IN OUR ACCOUNTABILITY. EFFORTS TO JUST CALL BACK. AS THEY COME INTO THE SYSTEM THEY'VE BEEN ASSESSED WITH THE CERTAIN KIND OF SUBSTITUTION EIGHT. THEY GET PLACED IN THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AS THEY WERE DEALING WITH THEIR PROGRAM THAT'S THE KIND OF THE NITTY GRITTY INFORMATION I'M- CURIOUS THAT WE COULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WERE MANAGING ARE ACTUALLY HELPING SERVICES I'M AGENCY AND SOMEONE SO IN I'LL- GET IT TO THEM TO SORT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE PLANNING ON ORDERING AND TRACKING THEIR DATA SPECIFICALLY I WILL SAY THAT HE- HAD BEEN BACK AT THE STATE LEVEL REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO BE TRACKED. YEAH YEAH- IS THERE SOMEBODY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON. BETTER IT THAT IS ON THE LINE THEY CAN ADDRESS SUCH QUESTIONS AND THAT'S BEEN ASKED BY SENATOR NELSON. HI I DON'T SEE IT ON MY FINANCE THERE'S NO ONE ON THE LINE FROM SOCIAL SERVICES BUT I WILL HIGHLIGHT THE FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOES PROPOSE FOR HDFC TO DO A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT. OF THE LOCAL HOMELESSNESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE STATE FUND ANALYSIS OF HOMES PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL NOT BE I BELIEVE THAT ANALYSIS WILL GET YOU SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. AND NOW YOU CAN CHIME. IN ELABORATE ON THAT PROPOSAL. HE I MENTIONED IT BRIEFLY I THINK THAT THE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT BUT WE'RE PLAYING ON CONDUCTING BE ORDINATION. AND- BUILDING OFF OF WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AND HAVE AVAILABLE IF ANY SHE ADDED. IT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE TAKING A LOOK AT. THE YOU KNOW THE VERY DIVERSE WAITING OUT HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEMS ARE ARE PLAYING OUT LOCALLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE THEY'RE INVESTING. WHAT STRATEGIES ARE INVESTING MOST IN AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS. AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S WAYS THAT NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OUR STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS ACROSS THE RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS. IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF UNDERSTANDING HOW. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS MATCHES WHAT REALLY IS IT pLEVEL I USUALLY THAT WOULD TRACK SOME OF THOSE STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS UNDERSTANDING WHAT KIND OF INTERVENTIONS. THOSE PROGRAMS FIND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE. ECOSYSTEM AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING I'M I'M THE LOCAL. LEVEL AND IF THAT IF THAT. THE MAN FROM FIND THEY JUST FOR- A LITTLE BIT OF A- ALMOST. LITERALLY A PICTURE. OF MY CAR OF WAR BEEN. AND DEALER WITH THE HOMELESS. WE H. LIKE IN PAINTER WE GET A BUCKET OF PAINT. A BRUSH COME INTO A ROOM A BIG LARGE WHITE WALL AND THEN JUST. THROWING THE PAINT ON THE WALL. THAT'S BEEN MY UP FOR IMPRESSIONABLE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AND I HOPE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO BE MORE SPECIFIC I THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO. HELP US OUT GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC SO WE CAN KEEP TRACK. OF THOSE POPULATIONS AND HOW THEY ARE PROSPERING HOPEFULLY. NOT NOT A PRESIDENT THEN HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION BUT I'LL DEFER FOR NOW PLEASE OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT. THE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST ABOUT. TRYING TO DOCUMENT SOME DATA AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT. RIGHT BY REGION CENTER CAMO- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THE CHOIR- THAT IS SINGING- AS IT RELATES TO THESE QUESTIONS AND I THINK I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ON ANYONE ELSE WHO WHO. CAN MAYBE ADD SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU KNOW- I SEE THEIR PROPOSAL FOR OUR HOME HE- AND THE- THE- GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE STABILITY- THAT- AROUND THE- PROGRAMS FROM PROJECT ROOM KEY. AND YOU KNOW I'M- BEING IN LA SO MY QUESTION IS GENERALLY AROUND SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THESE FUNDS. AND TRACKING HOW WE ARE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE REASON WHY I AM ASKING THE QUESTION IS BECAUSE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY- IS AFRICAN AMERICAN. 35% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IS LATINO OUR ANGLO HOMELESS POPULATION HAS DECREASED BY 7% AND YET WHEN WE ADMINISTERED PROJECT HOME KEY IN MY COUNTY- THE ROOMS THAT WERE THE ONES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO HOMELESS FOLKS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY. PROVIDED TO WHITE ANGELENOS AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO INFUSE GREATER DOLLARS INTO ATTACKING AND COMBATING THE ISSUE AROUND HOMELESSNESS I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WERE ALSO PRETTY HONEST ABOUT WHAT HOW AND WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING DISTRIBUTED. AND WHAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS ARE THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR AND DEMANDING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE. HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET OFF THE STREETS AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT IF THAT IS PART OF THAT SURVEY LANDSCAPE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR SOMETHING ELSE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. YEAH I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND WE DO EXPECT THAT THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS WE WILL BE LOOKING AT. THE LANDSCAPE MEANT I WOULD ALSO JUST MENTIONED THAT EACH YEAH I ASKED THE PUBLIC BURDEN IS THAT WHY HE NOW HAS A WHOLE SECTION SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO RACIAL DISPARITIES WE ARE WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY BY CONTINUING CARE RIGHTNOW I'M- PROVIDING THAT. THAT DATA WITH THEM AD HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO USE THAT AND TARGET AND AN ADDRESS. THAT STAND THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD ALSO MENTION YOUR REALLY NEEDS THAT HAVE AROUND YOU HI THE EQUITY. WEIGHT AND IT'S- PERFORMANCE THAT HURTS SO WE ARE WITH HAITI'S RIGHT NOW RIGHT HERE NOW ON A FRIEND YOU. TO ENSURE THAT THEY MET RACIAL EQUITY BUILDING CAN HELP THEM WORK IT WITH THAT BACK. ADAM VERY MUCH A FOCUS ON THE WORK WE ARE DOING IT CREATING A- COUNCIL VERY WE THEY- CRITICAL P. I HATE THAT WE VERY MUCH THE KIND OF WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT- THROUGH THE LATE. THOSE TYPE ALASKA'S DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ABOUT HOME KEY- SENATOR- WE RELEASED ON APRIL FIRST A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT- THAT WAS RIGHT ACTUALLY REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATURE- ONE HOME KEY ON THE NINETY FOUR PROJECTS THAT WERE PART OF HOME Q. LAST YEAR- PRODUCING OVER SIX THOUSAND. NEW UNITS OF PERMANENT HOUSING FOR PERSONS- THAT WERE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND I WAS ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO FIND RIGHT NOW THE PAGE BECAUSE THERE IS A SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED IN THE REPORT- BILE- THE NOT ONLY DID REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESENINETY FOUR PROJECTS BUT ALSO HOLD THEY SERVED AS IN IN INCLUDING THEM YOU KNOW WITH THE EQUITY LENS THAT YOU MENTIONED SORT OF- RACE AND ETHNICITY AND WE HAVE ALL THAT DATA. IN THE REPORT SO- I. D. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A COPY OF THAT REPORT- BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE ARE POINTING OUT WHICH I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO. THOSE THAT ARE MORE AT AT AT THE NEEDIEST PERSONS- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE VERY INTENTIONAL DURING THE COLD HERE WE PLAN TO CONTINUE AS PART OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR WALKMAN COMPUTING. FUTURE THANK YOU FOR THAT I IT'S ALSO IN. TO ACKNOWLEDGE- YOU KNOW OUR WHOLE POP. IS NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP THERE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THERE HAVE BEEN HOME FOLKS WHO ARE HOMELESS. FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME IT IS MORE THAN JUST OR DEEPER THAN JUST SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH-IS A VERY. BROAD BRUSH STROKE IT TOO WAS A WATERCOLOR IF I'M GOING TO- SHARE THE ANALOGY GIVEN BY- MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR NIELSEN- YOU KNOW THERE IS TRADE THAT HAVE. THERE KINDS OF AKON THAT- THERE DO KIND OF. THAT ARE OF TO SINGLE. HOMELESS AS A TO- FAMILY OR THE WITH TWO- FIRST WOMEN. I YOU KNOW HOW YOU MAY- SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN HOME FOR TH NINE YEARS- IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN HOW YOU. MANAGE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN HOMELESS FOR. MAYBE LESS THAN ONE OR TWO OR IS HOMELESS AND WORKING SO I AM HOPING THAT PART OF THESE PROPOSALS ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT KIND OF NEW ONES. AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE USING- AND INCORPORATING INTO THE GRANTS AND THE FUNDING THAT IT IS GIVING OUT TO LOCALITIES- TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE. I JUST HAVE ONE- FINAL QUESTION MADAM CHAIR AND IT'S ME IT'S ME IT'S. A EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW ON MOTHER'S. HI I WAS IN MY DISH IN A FAN OF FIVE- LIVING IN THEIR CAR. OF A MAN AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR THREE KIDS- AND THEY HAVE BEEN HOMELESS. BECAUSE THEY GO TO THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TO OUR- CITIES IN OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENTS TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK AFTER PAPERWORK AFTER TO PAPERWORK AND FOR A REASON AFTER ANOTHER THEY ARE EITHER DENIED A SERVICE OR ARE ASKED TO COME BACK. SO THAT DEPARTMENT- THATORGANIZATION IS STILL EARNING REVENUE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN AN APPLICANT BUT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT GOTTEN ANY SERVICE. AND AS I TALKED TO THIS FAMILY FOR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES ON MOTHER'S DAY WATCHING STARS BABY COVER HERSELF IN YOGURT. AND LISTENING TO THEM TELL ME THAT THEY ARE LIVING WITH THE DIGNITY THAT THE STATE HAS DECIDED TO GIVE THEM. I AM COMPELLED TO ASK WHAT IN THESE PROPOSALS ADDRESS THE FACT THAT WE ARE SENDING PEOPLE MILES AND MILES AWAY TO GET SERVICES THAT FOR ANY REASON AFTER ANOTHER THEY ARE DENIED. YOU CANNOT DRIVE TO THE FREE PARKING PLACE TO STAY IF YOU'RE ON PROBATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET YOUR TAGS RENEWED. YOU CANNOT GET HOUSING IF YOU DON'T HAVE APPROPRIATE I. D. IT IS CRITERIA AFTER CRITERIA AFTER CRITERIA THAT THEY FEEL WE ARE IMPLEMENTING. TO KEEP THEM FROM THE SERVICES. AND IT RUNS COUNTER TO HOW FLUSH WE ARE WITH MONEY EXCITED ABOUT GIVING IT OUT. SO CAN SOMEONE SHARE WITH ME. HOW STAR IN DIJON ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THESE PROPOSALS THAT WE WILL BE VOTING ON. HAVING TO TAKE A CRACK ABOUT REALLY- I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT BEING BROUGHT DOWN THE PEOPLE WE SERVE I THINK I CAN PART OF ME IMPORTANT AND ANTHONY HE'S VERY MUCH TRYING AND CENTER I'M NOT ONE OF THE- THAT I AM MOST PROUD OF AS AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA AND IN A ROLE THAT I. PLAYED FACT THAT WE ARE THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY- THAT IS BY LAW HOUSING FIRST STAGE WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT THERE IS NO BARRIER NO PRE CONDITIONS THAT EVERYONE IS READY TO GET PERMANENTLY HOUSE AND YET. SO WE HAD A CSP THAT AS PART OF OUR OUR MANDATE IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATE FUNDING THAT GOES OUT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SIDE FIRST PRINCIPLES I'M STILL PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO WORK TO DO LIST REDUCE SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS ARE MENTIONING- PART OF THE REASON THAT WE ARE DOUBLING DOWN. HOMELESSNESS IN THIS IS THAT LAST HOMELESS A TIME K. OUT FROM I'M US HAS AND URBAN. SURE THE FAMILY HOME AND THE MOST MONEY IN POPULAR OF ALMOST IN OUR STATE ADAM IS A THAT YOU SEE AROUND REMEMBERING ONCE THAT THE THING IS INCREASES SPSS- WITH OUR AROUND AS WELL AS THAT AND IT'S HARD IN OUR- FOR HOME HE HAVEN'T DOLLAR FOR THAT I MEAN GOING TOWARDS. PERMANENT FAMILY HOW- IS MUCH FOR ARE HOPING HE WILL HELP SEARCH LIKE- AND SO UNDERSTANDING THE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR. RIGHT NOW I THERE MAKING SURE EVERY MAKES HOMELESSNESS THAT IS MUCH FUN YOU'RE TRY TO DOUBLE IN FOR AND ENSURE THAT ALL THAT MONEY IS BEING THROUGHOUT FIRST CLIENTS IS NOT ANY ANY ADDED BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY I'M GETTING. EARNERS ACCOUNTABLE TO DOING WHAT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SENATOR- CAMPBELL- I WANNA- REALLY CONFIRM WHAT- THE SENATOR JUST JUST SAID IS ON. PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF OVER THE PAST- NUMBER OF YEARS AND I AND MY CONCERN IS BEEN THAT M. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS TO GETTING US DATA BUT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE TRACKING AND- SO- MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO BE GENERAL IN IN THIS REGARD- BUT I DO THINK NUMBER ONE IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRESERVE THE GAINS AND PROTECT THE HOME KEY INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UP TO THIS POINT. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT ANYBODY. HAS MADE SURE THAT THE UNITS THAT ARE BEING PURCHASED. ARE BEING. RETAINED AS AFFORDABLE UNITS INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DECIDES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM USING THOSE UNITS THAT. THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE NON PROFITS TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE I JUST I FEEL VERY STRONGLY WE NEED TO START PROTECTING THAT INVESTMENT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD USE THE FEDERAL FUNDS FIRST THEY HAVE A DROP DEAD DEADLINE AND SO I THINK WE GOT TO PRIORITIZE AND GET THAT MONEY OUT. IN AND UTILIZED- IN REGARDS TO THE- THE ISSUE THAT THE DOG. SENATOR NIELSEN RACED. IS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS PROPOSAL A NUMBER. OF HOUSING. MONEY GOING TO ENTITIES THAT WHOSE. FIRST PRIORITY IS NOT NECESSARILY HOUSING SO- THE MONEY GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THEY HAVE THEIR JOB. IS ON THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM- AND- AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ADDRESS TO IT I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF A CD BECAUSE EACH CD UNDERSTANDS HOUSING AND THEY UNDERSTAND. KIND OF THE PARAMETERS AROUND- BUILDING HOUSING PROTECTING IT FOR. CERTAIN PURPOSE AND- AND THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THAT AND BY THE SAME TOKEN- THE MONEY IS GOING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NO QUESTION WE NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVCES. BUT BUT THERE MAY BE LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WELL WE NEED THE DATA WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT DATA TO SAY- IF WE MARRY. HOUSING WITH THESE PARTICULAR SERVICES THAT YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE DATE IN THE INFORMATION CONSISTENT. ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. TOM AND- THEN- THERE IS A- HM THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES THAT THE HOME KEY FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. WOULD WOULD BE IN TWO PARTS THE FIRST PART THE MONEY WOULD GO UP BY A PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY WOULD GO TO BIG CITIES AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT THE SMALLER CITIES WE WOULD RECEIVE THEIR BITE INTO THE BIGGER CITIES WOULD GET IT PER CAPITA PER CAPITA THE SMALLER CITIES HAVE TO FIGHT IT'S A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AS AS A SENATOR THAT REPRESENTS NOTHING BUT SMALLER CITIES- I OPPOSE THAT. I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT COMPETITIVE IT'S COMPETITIVE ACROSS THE BOARD OTHERWISE I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO IT WE ARE DIVIDED BASED ON- BASED ON ON- THAT POPULATION BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT CONCERN FROM THE SMALLER CITIES ABOUT. MONEY'S GOING TO THE COUNTIES AND THE MONEY NEVER GETTING TO THE SMALLER CITIES IN THAT COUNTY AND SO I WANT TO I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I DON'T THINK THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS A CARVE OUT FOR THE BIG CITIES AND I GET THAT THEIR ISSUES MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES BUT EVERYBODY IS SUFFERING UNDER STAFFED WITH THIS HOMELESS ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD PENALIZE THE SMALLER. THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES AS WELL I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH TAKES CARE OF THE ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THE CALIFORNIANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THE REASON THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE- THAT ARE PART OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE- THAT WE HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST THROWING MONEY OUT THERE AND AS- SENATOR COM AUGER SAID- PEOPLE ARE GETTING LOTS OF MONEY THEY HAVE A LOT TO STAFF WORKING BUT- WE'RE NOT. HOUSING THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WERE IN IT WAS INTENDED FOR SO- THIS IS AN ITEM THAT IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA SEE THIS BACK AGAIN AND- APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS SENATOR NELSON YOU HAD ONE MORE YOU WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ASK ABOUT. ANOTHER CONCERT ON RISE ON IT IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR COULD. WE HERE ARE PRETTY UNANIMOUS ON OUR CONCERNS. AND AS WE. PROCEED AND AS WE COME BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO BE MUCH BETTER. AS TO. ONE THE WHOLE PERSON OR THE FAMILIES LIKE BEEF SENATOR FROM ANGELES GOT TO CONFRONT SADLY ON MOTHER'S DAY. COME TO THE OFFICE TO WHOMEVER THEY CONTACT THEY THEN ARE SAID WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS THIS SO YOU HAVE TO GO THERE BUT THAT'S TWENTY MILES AWAY. BUT THEY GO THERE AND THEN THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF PAPERWORK TO FILL OUT WHICH IS ALSO CHALLENGING AND THEN THEY SAY WELL SORRY YOU DON'T NEED TO TEST. THAT SHOW KIND OF A BUREAUCRATIC ELABORATE THAT FOLKS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BREAK THROUGH. SO THE PEOPLE ARE HELPED THAT THE DISPOSITION OF THE AGENCY'S FLORAL ART TO HELP NOT TO HINDER. THIS MESS AND GET THEM OUT OF THEIR HAIR BUT THAT THEY WOULD GO AWAY AT LEAST KNOWING WHAT THE NEXT STEP CLEARLY HERE'S WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TIME. TO DO IT WE DON'T DO THAT AND WE WANT TO SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THAT KIND OF SEDITION ASSISTANCE BY THEIR GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU MATT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WAIT YOU KNOW I DID OCCUR TO ME AS YOU WERE YOU WERE TALKING THERE WAS ONE MORE ISSUE IN REGARDS TO THE HOME KEY OR ANY OF THAT PURCHASE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE SMALL HOTELS THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT I SPOKE WITH.

WERE READY AND THEY HAD BEEN WORKING ON THIS CONCEPT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS HELP FOR THOSE. SMALLER COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO.

NOW WE SPEAK A LOT ABOUT A HOUSE IN PRODUCTION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT LIMITED SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA KEEPS MAKING HOUSING.

MANY PROPERTIES INDICATE CD PORTFOLIO ARE COMING TO THE END OF THE CALL BUTTON AND USE THAT INSURED BELOW MARKET RATES. FOR QUALIFIED AT TENANTS WE ALL HAVE HEARD STORIES OF COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE PHASE WHEN GENTRIFICATION AND RISING DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES COMMUNITIES THAT IN THE PAST FACE THIS INVESTMENT AND NOW ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING WITH ACCELERATING HOUSING COST.

TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DINNER CUISE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOW ABOUT THE- LMAO. THIS MY LIST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MANY OF OUR OVER ARCHING COMMENTS THAT I MADE RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS ALSO APPLY TO THE MAY REVISION HOUSING PROPOSALS- SPECIFICALLY IN MANY CIRCLES ALSO REQUIRE TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT WHICH IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. CANCEL BE LOOKING FOR THAT LANGUAGE TO ASSESS HOW SOME OF THESE KEY IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS WILL BE MADE. FOR EXAMPLE ON HOW EACH CD WOULD ASSESS HOW IT WOULD AWARD- AND ASSESS A LEGIBILITY FOR THE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BACKLOG FUNDING IN THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION. HOWEVER IN OTHER CASES SUCH AS FOR THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANT PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED ITS INTENT TO FINALIZE ITS ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY ADMINISTRATIVELY FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF THE BUDGET. RATHER THAN TWO TRAILER FELL AND THE TEMPERATURE. WOULD LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. AND FINALLY AS WE SET FOR. AS WELL. THERE ARE MAJOR AND IN SPACE INTO IT'LL BE MORE CRUISE THAN EVER FOR THE LUNCH TO. THAT IT HAS STRONG IN A CALIBER BY USING STATUE AND BILL LANGUAGE ANOTHER. OR AND AGAIN THESE ARE JUST OUR INITIAL AND WILL. LOOK FOR TO SEE THE REPORTING BACK ONCE WE DO A CHANCE REVIEW THE BELOW. THANK YOU. LET ME ASK ROQUE COULD YOU TELL US WHICH ARE THE- THE PROPOSALS THAT ANTICIPATE- DOING IT AFTER THE PATCH IT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED ME JUST SAY THAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THAT STRATEGY BUT COULD YOU. COULD YOU CALL THEM OUT FOR FRESH VERY QUICKLY ON THE IN. THESE ISSUE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. WHERE AWARE OF THE PLANNING. GRANT TO SOMETHING THAT FALL. FOR THE OTHER IT'LL BE A MATTER OF WHAT ADULT INCLUDE IN THE TRAILER BELOW AND WHICH IS NOT TO BE LET THERE MAY BE SUFFICIENT. THERE MIGHT NOT BE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN REPORT BACK ONCE THE LANGUAGE IS AVAILABLE IT'S ONLY. THE ONE THAT WE'RE AWARE THAT THE INTENT IS FOR THERE TO BE- FOR IT TO BE DONE AFTERTHE FACT MR DOUBLY. OKAY YEAH I JUST I GUESS NINO THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING SO MUCH WORK IN THIS AREA- SOME REALLY CONCRETE WORK THAT THAT- THE IDEA OF WAITING. AND JUST LETTING THE ADMINISTRATION. DO THE- AFTER WE'VE ALREADY THE BUDGET DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME- SO I WOULD. I WOULD I WOULD JUST PUT THAT CABBIE OUT THERE AND SAY THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT. CAN BE PLAGIARIZED OR CAN BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS BUDGET- THAT THAT THAT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO GETTING US ARE NOT OF APPROVAL- BUT THAT'S JUST MY GUT REACTION SENATOR NIELSEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. AND I THINK YOU FOR THAT THAT- INFORMATION TODAY. JUST KIND OF. FOLLOWING THIS ALL CLOSE WITH THIS MADAM CHAIR AT THIS IS BEEN A PRODUCTIVE. SEGMENT IN. CAREFULLY REVIEW OUR DOCTOR. AND THE COMMENTS TODAY. HI SHE- AGREED. ABSENCE OF ANY DISCUSSION OF EASING THE REGULATORY BURDEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND EVEN AS WELL FOR OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING. SOMETHING JUST STICKS SO PROFOUNDLY IN MY MIND OF LAST YEAR A HOMELESS ADVOCATE TESTIFYING PASSIONATELY. THAT WOULD LEAVE THE BUILDING THE SMALLHOUSES FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CHEAPER. IF THE REGULATORY BURDEN WAS EAST EVEN ON THIS VERY NECESSARY HOUSING SO I'M ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION KNEW EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO SEND OUT THE WORD TO THE REGULATORY AGENCIES. TO EXAMINE WHAT THEY THOSE AGENCIES CAN DO TO EVEN EVEN THE IMMEDIATE THE REGULATORY BURDEN THAT SOUL AND FIGHTS THE COST OF LOW INCOME HOUSING. HOUSING FOR HOMELESS HOUSING FOR. MIGRANT FARM WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- COMMENT- ON TEM ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN AND ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN AGAIN- FLEXIBILITY IN USING THE FEDERAL FUNDS FIRST WOULD BE- PROVIDE MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT THOSE RESOURCES GO TO EITHER CHEVROLET THE PROJECTS ARE TWO PROJECTS WHERE THE RESOURCES CAN BE USED TO GET US READY TO BE SHOVEL. SHOVEL READY OTHERWISE I AM. I THINK THESE ARE ARE- THIS IS A GOOD EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES AND AGAIN WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EAC EIGHT CD IS REALLY. OVERSEEING HOUSING RESOURCES NO MATTER WHERE WHERE THEY WERE SENDING THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. THE BOTH ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AND ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN OR HOLD OPEN ITEM SO EXPECT TO GET TO SEE THEM BACK AGAIN. MAYBE WITH THE- SOME TRAILER BLLING WHICH IT'LL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THEY'LL BE- ROLLED OUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN WHICH IS A KELLY CHIEF A PROPOSAL. AND LIKE TO INVENT THAT INVITE THE- DIRECTOR OF COLLEGE OF A- AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION. THAT IS CORRECT- CHAIR ALSO GOOD AFTERNOON JUDGE SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY NAME IS FRANCIS MARTES AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AND POLICY AT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY.

SO FIRST ON ON HOME JUST SO ARE ENOUGH IN IN HER OWNERSHIP YOUR INCOME. R. O. STANDING I'M THE CORNER BAND AND MAKE FOR THE D. AND HAS. THE LOBSTER. THAT LOWER INCOME HOW FOR. WHEN THEY SEE TO BUY ALL. AND BUILDING TO JENNA WEALTH SO IN ORDER TO. ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC RECOVERY RESILIENCY AND ALSO EQUITY. THE MEROVINGIAN PROPOSES A HUNDRED MILLION. IN ONE TIME FEDERAL BOTH FUNDS. TO COLLEGE OF FAME TO EXPAND ITS FIRST TIME HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WHICH HELPS FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WITH MAKING I DON'T PAYMENT SECURING ALONE AND ALSO. PAYING CLOSING COSTS AND ALL. SO IF APPROVED COLLEGE FATE. PLUS THE DEPLOY THESE FUNDS TO GREATER LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE HOME BUYER IN STACKED. I NEEDED OF HOME A- FOURTEEN MORE CALLOUS. AND I WILL SPEAK. ABOUT EIGHTY USE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. IN RECENT YEARS THAT LEGISLATURE HAS IT POSSIBLE FOR HOUSEHOLDS INVEST BEST WAY GREATER OF LOCAL APPROVAL. IN A SENSE WE DO WANT UNIT TO WANT TO THANK RELIGIOUSLY FOR THIS- SO I DON'T FIND A- HAS AND REMAINS IN A FOR MANY. THAT DON'T WANT BUILD- AN EXCESS DWELLING YOU SO FOR THIS WE COLLEGE A FABLE BE STARTING UP FOR TO THE PRODUCTION. OF EIGHTEEN USING MILLION AN EXISTING FUNDS I WONDER MAYBE FOR. TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY ONE MILLION SO IT'S THE EIGHTY ONE MILLION ON TOP OF THE EXISTING. NINE NINETEEN FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED- I NEVER PROVED THE EDITION ALL WE SAW. ARE EXPECTED TO BRING- APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF HOW ALL OF US LEGAL IMMUNITY ONLINE QUICKLY AND INEXPENSIVELY WITH THE ADDED BENEFIT OF HELPING LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES CREATE WEALTH BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE HOUSE. AND THAT IT IS ALL FOR AND IN TERMS THE COLLEGE OF THE ITEMS AND I'LL HAVE TO TALK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TURNING IT OVER NOW TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR pDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. VERY GOOD HOW ABOUT THE LA- NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. VERY GOOD I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS AND- SENATOR NELSON. NO QUESTIONS- I WAS QUICKLY TRYING TO DO FIVE THOUSAND INTO. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M I AM. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER FIVE THOUSAND IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE ON WHAT YOU DO ON WHAT WE'D END UP SEEING- BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A PRETTY BIG INVESTMENT AND WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS BUT I DO. I DO APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON EIGHTY YEARS I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO- TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE BUT TO TURN TO GET IT A QUICK- TURN AROUND. IN IN UNITS WHICH IS WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WHOLE ISSUE IS WE NEED MORE UNITS TODAY AND THE QUICKER WE CAN GET HIM ON THE GROUND THE BETTER THEY ARE. ME ASK YOU THIS DO YOU ANTICIPATE COMING UP WITH THE PLANNED. WE GET BACK UP I AM. PLANNED PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE APPROVED SO THAT THEY DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A HUGE BURDEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO ARE YOU. LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO GRANTS FOR HOMEOWNERS SO THAT THEY CAN. USE THIS GRANT MONEY TO DO THE EIGHTY YOU AND KEEP IT AFFORDABLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE FIVE THOUSAND. THE UNIT ESTIMATE WAS FOR THE- EIGHTY ONE MILLION. SO IF YOU CONSIDER THE NINETEEN MILLION AN EXISTING RESOURCES WE ARE ALSO PUTTING FORWARD A NUMBER COMES OUT CLOSER TO SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED. SO IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN ASSISTANCE FOR UNITS THAT WERE KIND OF ESTIMATED AND- I THINK A VERY GOOD POINT THAT YOU RAISE IT REGARDING- YOU KNOW PRE APPROVALS- AND ALSO- PROVIDING GRANTS- I THINK THE EXACT DETAILS ON THE FINANCING. ESTRUCTURA MECHANISM WILL BE FORTHCOMING BUT- YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO. SPEAKING TO YOU ANOTHER ABOUT AND ANY SUGGESTIONS OR THANK YOU I WOULD IT WOULD GOING TO BE HARD TO DO WHEN MILLION. AND AMERICAN IT WAS KIND OF AN EASY NOW. I GUESS THAT. THE MINE. IS THE COW OF SANTA CRUZ IS COMING UP WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTIES AND THEY- THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED SOME PLANS THAT- THAT ARE PRE APPROVED. AND THAT DON'T REQUIRE ANY REVIEW FROM THEIR THEIR PLANNING- ENTITY OTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- FOLLOW THE SET BACKS AND THE KINDS OF. OF POLICY SAID THAT DON'T DELAY A PROJECT BUT THEY ALSO WILL FIND IT AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET THESE THINGS DONE IS TO FIND IT. AND THIS TO COME UP WITH PLANS AND SO I'M- I'M HOPING THAT'S WHAT'S INTENDED- IN IT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE- THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE SENATE HAS PRIORITIZED FIRST A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM- J. TO START TO DEVELOP. WEALTH IN COMMUNITIES WHERE EQUITY IN A HOME PROVIDES THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SO THIS IS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- THE PRIORITY FOR MYSELF IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO FOR THE SENATE AND SO. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE GET REAL GOOD DETAILS ON HOW THIS WOULD OPERATE AND HOW WHEN WOULD ACCESS THIS KIND OF OPPORTUNITY IN MANY OF MY COMMUNITIES THE OPPORTUNITY BACK HOUSE STILL WITHIN REACH BUT THERE. THERE'S A NEED FOR PROGRAM SO- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS ANOTHER HOLDOVER OPEN ITEMS- SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BACK AGAIN. I REMEMBER WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OPEN THIS THIS ITEM- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN IT IS IT IS ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THE O. PR BUDGET SUMMARY. END LIKE TO INVITE THE DIRECTOR. KATE GORDAN. TO START US OFF HOW MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH CARE GOOD AFTERNOON A TRICKERY AUTO CENTER COME LONGER INTENDED- NIELSEN I AM CAIT GORDON SIX YOU AGAIN. ACTOR OF GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PLAY AND RESEARCH AND- OF THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC COUNCIL. AND I'M HERE JUST TO PROVIDE BRIEF AND HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF- PR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS WHICH INCLUDED AS ITEMS NINETEEN ON YOUR AGENDA. AS YOU KNOW- PR'S ROLE IS TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND GUIDANCE TO THE GOVERNOR AND CABINET ALL LONG RANGE PLANNING AND RESEARCH ISSUES INCLUDING LAND USE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND INCREASINGLY CRADLE TO CAREER HEALTH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE- PR JUST AS A REMINDER INCLUDES IN ITS BUDGET UNIT BOTH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AND HELP ON. THE INTERIORS SH WHAT IMPORTANT NOTE AS YOU WERE CONSIDERING ALL THESE BUDGET ITEMS. I'LL BE OURS VERY SMALL. CONSIDERING OUR REACH WE CURRENTLY HAVE JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIX PEOPLE WORKING ACROSS APPEAR STC AND CALLAN TEARS. RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF GRANT DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR DIRECTLY TO COMMUNITIES AND PROJECTS AND TO PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE OUR TEAM WORKS VERY HARD TO COORDINATE AND COLLABORATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PROVIDE. THAT GUIDANCE. TO REGIONAL LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO EVALUATE OUR PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS- WITH METRICS DRIVEN EVALUATION. WE ALSO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME COORDINATING AMONG AND ACROSS STATE AGENCIES TO IMPROVE COLLABORATION INSURE OUR POLICIES ARE AS ALIGNED AS POSSIBLE. AND WORK TO ADVANCE THE LEGISLATURE'S IMPORTANT GOALS. IN MANY WAYS WE'RE THE FAN IT BUT VERY STRONG GLUE THAT CONNECTS MANY OF THE LARGER PIECES OF THE STATE'S GOALS AND PRIORITIES. I'LL GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW TODAY ABOUT R. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT- PR AND- SPC. AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE GOT FRIDAY DIRECTOR PALANTIR'S IS HERE TO GIVE A QUICK BACKGROUND ON THAT CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER ITEMS. I'LL NOTE THAT JUST GIVEN THE- ACTING DIRECTOR. BEST YOU SEE IS ALSO. RUSSIANS THE PANEL. SO QUICKLY- QUICKER OF THE PIECES YOU HAVE HERE WHICH ARE CUTTING HAS ALL OF OUR ON SEVERAL OF THESE P. ARE RELATED TO THIS AND MUCH LIKE CLIMATE AGENDA THE GOVERNORS COME PLAN IS- AND PROPOSAL IS CUT AND A WHOLE OF APPROACH ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF OUR STATE ECONOMY OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. AND TODAY I WANT TO JUST OUTLINED SOME FOUNDATIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE HOUSED A COORDINATED- PR AN STC THAT WILL ACTUALLY SUPPORT EVERY ONE OF THE OTHER PIECES IN THE COMEBACK PLAN NOT JUST THE KIND OF PIECES BUT ACROSS EVERY AREA OF GOVERNMENT. BY EMPHASIZING DECISION MAKING BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RATHER THAN TOP DOWN APPROACHES WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE ND THE LEGISLATURE ON TO MOVE THESE PIECES SO BRIEFLY WHERE THOSE PIECES ARE FIRST- THEY'RE A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER FROM WHERE THEY ARE IN YOUR AGENDA I APOLOGIZE. BUT I'M I'M DOING THEM PHONETICALLY. ON THE FIRST THE FIFTH CLIMATE YOU ASSESSED THIS WOULD BE TWENTY TWO MILLION OVER FIVE. TO THE GOVERNOR'S OF PLANNING RESEARCH CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO IMPLEMENT. THE FIFTH CALVARY CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT WHICH WAS PUT INTO STATUTE LAST YEAR THROUGH S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY. IF WE CAN'T MEASURE CLIMATE IMPACTS WE CAN'T MANAGE THEM AN INVESTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATECHANGE ASSESSMENT AND SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH AND SCIENCE IS FOUNDATIONAL. TO IMPLEMENTING EVERY ONE OF THE STATE'S CARBON NEUTRALITY IN RESILIENCE PRIORITIES. THIS ASSESSMENT WILL FOCUS ON TURNING SCIENCE TO ACTIONABLE ACTUALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON THE ON THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES PUT FORTH AN SP THIRTEEN TWENTY. OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REDUCING RISK TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING ECONOMIC STABILITY IN THE IN THAT PHASE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WOULD INCLUDE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND EITHER HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR NATIONALLY THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TRIBAL CLIMATE RESEARCH PROGRAMS A TRIBAL DRIVEN SECTION OF THE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION. TO TRIBAL APPROACHES TO SCIENCE AND TO- WHEN MANAGEMENT. THE SECOND IS ALL TALK ABOUT IS. REALLY FINDING ACTIONABLE CLIMATE SCIENCE THAT'S ABOUT TURNING AGAIN THAT SCIENCE ACTION JUST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED THROUGH SB TWO FORTY SIX. THAT IS THE ONLY STATUTORILY CREATED CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAM IN THE STATE THIS WOULD INVEST IN I. KERR- WHICH IS A PUBLIC BODY HI BY INVESTING IN TOOLS TO TRANSLATE COMPLEX CLIMATE SCIENCE INTO ACTION AND IMPORTANTLY WOULD ALSO SUPPORT A NEW ID CARD VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PLATFORM WHICH ALLOWS US TO START MAPPING. THOSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE IMPACTS MANY OF WHICH ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS CAPTURED EASILY BY OTHER. TOOLS THAT WE HELP TO MEASURE EQUITY IMPACTS. THE THIRD BIG AREA THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCE GREAT GRANT PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS TO OPR TO FIND. LOCAL AND REGIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE GRANTS ONE THING WE HEAR OVER AND OVER TO A PR IS THAT THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT AT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. FOR A LONG TERM CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE PLANNING. OUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CODE NINETEEN ON LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS ONLY EXACERBATED THIS DYNAMIC AND MADE IT EVEN HARDER FOR THESE GOVERNMENTS DO THAT KIND OF PLANNING. THESE GRANTS WILL SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL ADAPTATION PLANNING AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THAT LONG TERM RESILIENCE. BUT NEXT DECIDE LIKE TO POINT TO IS REALLY A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY DRIVEN STRATEGY WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE FELT VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE STATE WE KNOW THAT HAD THE SOLUTIONS PLAY OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS NEED TO BE COMMUNITY DRIVEN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW TO DO THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND. THEY BRING TOGETHER CLIMATE HOUSING WORKFORCE TRANSPORTATION. OUT AT WORK AND TRAINING ALL IN ONE PROJECT IS THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION OVER THREE YEARS TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM. AND MAKES A STAINTHE PLACE BASED IN INVESTMENTS INTO THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THIS PROGRAM REALLY SHOULD BE SEEN AS- INTEGRATING ALL THOSE ELEMENTS I TALKED ABOUT BUT IT'S ALSO A HOUSING PROGRAM AND A AND T. C. C. IS REALLY HOUSING INNOVATION. KIND OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECT HOUSING PRODUCTION AS A PRIORITY ACROSS ALL T. SHE. GREAT T. IMMUNITIES. THIS PROPOSE PARTED MILLION. INVESTMENT WOULDN'T MORE K. TO BENEFIT FROM THESE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY DRIVEN APPROACHES. TCC I WANT TO KNOW IT ALREADY HAS A PIPELINE OF FOURTEEN COMMUNITIES WAS SHOVEL READY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS READY TO APPLY FOR THIS KIND OF IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING. INCLUDING SEVERAL IN SOUTH LA WHICH I KNOW CENTER COME UNDER YOUR DISTRICT EAST LA AT RICHMOND FOR MINE AND MCFARLAND AND INDIA. NEXT YOUR PROJECTS WILL BE READY IN BAKERSFIELD COACHELLA VALLEY UNINCORPORATED SOUTH SACRAMENTO FOR BILL SAN DIEGO TO LARRY. AND WEST OAKLAND SURE REALLY EIGHT CROSS STATE. URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES LOOKING. AT TAKING THESE INTEGRATED APPROACHES. AND FINALLY I HAVE THE- I'D LIKE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO IMPLEMENT THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM. AS ENVISIONED BY SP TEN SEVENTY TWO. THIS PROGRAM REALLY DOES THE WORK TO HELP DIRECTLY PROVIDE GRANTS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE KINDS OF STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME. BUILDING A PLAN WE'RE DOING AN INFORMATION STRATEGY WE'RE LOOKING AT A- A REGIONAL APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE PART OF THAT. I DID PART OF THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN BY PROVIDING DIRECT CAPACITY SUPPORT TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN BE THINGS LIKE CHILD CARE AT MEETINGS THAT CAN BE DIRECT HONORARIA TO PARTICIPATE IT CAN BE. A CAPACITY BUILDING IT WILL BE VERY VERY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE THAT UNDERLIES SO MUCH OF OUR BUDGET. REALLY JUST INSURING THAT WE ARE TAKING A COMMUNITY DRIVEN APPROACH. I ONLY SEE MORE THING ABOUT HANDED UP TO MY COLLEAGUE GOT FRIDAY TO SEE IF YOU WORDS ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER PIECES OF THIS- PROPOSAL I DID WANT TO SAY THAT- PR IN ADDITION TO ALL OF OUR WORK ON CLIMATE. ALSO DOES A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK ON RESEARCH AND EDUCATION WE DO HAVE A BUDGET ITEM FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION FOUR K. THROUGH SIXTEEN REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES THAT'S BEING HEARD OVER THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS INSIDE ONE TOUCH ON THAT TODAY. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE ABOUT TWELVE POINT FOUR MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND OUR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. RESEARCH WORK THROUGH OUR PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAM WHICH ASSISTS IN DETECTING TOXIC STRESS TO PREVENT LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AMONG OTHER THINGS. THIS IS VERY COMPLEMENTARY TO THE SURGEON GENERAL'S WORK ON IT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND REALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING ACROSS THE STATE WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS WHETHER IT'S WILDFIRES OR OTHER CLIMATE SHOCKS. ARE ACTUALLY BEING LOOKED AT AND EVALUATED WHAT WE'RE DOING- I HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. EVALUATION OF THESE CALIFORNIANS. WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN BRIEFLY TO DRAW FRIDAY. OF CALIFORNIA. TO JUST TO HIM ITEMS AND THEN CAN TAKE WHAT. VERY GOOD. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK U. K. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY GO OVER A COUPLE OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE FIRST IS THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLLEGE PROGRAM AND WITH THIS PROGRAM WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO CREATE A CULTURE OF SERVICE BY INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION OF SERVING THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH ALLOWS TO HELP TACKLE SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES TODAY LIKE EDUCATION DISPARITIES AND LEARNING LOSS FROM COVE IT. CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD AND SECURITY AND MANY OTHERS AND THEN ALSO MUCH LIKE THE GI BILL HAS DONE FOR GENERATIONS OF VETERANS IN OUR COUNTRY WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT TO SERVE OUR STATE SO IF YOU JUST KEEP ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM THROUGH A STATEMENT ON A SCHOLARSHIP- THE CUT CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COLLEGE PROGRAM CREATES ACTUAL DEBT FREE PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS TO COMMIT TO AN ACADEMIC YEAR SERVICE WHILE STAYING ON TRACK TO GRADUATE AND WE'RE GONNA BE WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH THE UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS. ON THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN ADDITION AB FIVE FORTY ELIGIBLE DREAMERS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS LIKE AMERICORPS AND THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSED PROGRAM INCLUDES THEM ALLOWS THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME SERVICE EXPERIENCES ELSE AND ALSO GIVES THEM THE SAME ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND ALSO JUST IT AND FINALLY TO GET A KIND OF A SENSE OF THE INTENDED IMPACT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. THIS WOULD CREATE A CORE SERVICE MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA LARGER THAN THE PEACE CORPS FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES A SECOND WE HAVE A YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT- AN OPPORTUNITY- PROPOSAL WHICH WILL INVEST IN SCALE JOB PROGRAMS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO HIRE YOUTH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THOSE THIS IS ESPECIALLY FOCUSED ON YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK WHO ARE NOT COLLEGE TRACK AND WHO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY COBIT OVER LAST YEAR AND A HALF. WITH THAT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR. AND SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY COM. AFTERNOON WEBER TO COVER OF FINANCE NOTRE WILL COME BUT AT HEAVY HELP INTERCOURSE YOU MAY HAVE VERY GOOD- SHOULD HAVE SOME REAL REAL QUESTIONS ARE FOR AND PRETTY SOON BE YOU CAN EVER GET OFF EASY SO- ABOUT- THE OF. HI THIS IS BRIAN WITH AFFORDABILITY ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR COMMENTS ON THE- OPR PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA SO I WILL MOVE THROUGH THESE ARE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. THINK REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS PROPOSALS CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS ARE STILL WORKING OUT SOME OF THE KEY DETAILS ON THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLLEGE SERVICE PROGRAM BUT- IT APPEARS TO BE CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH THE STATE. COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. WE NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS WILL NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO AVOID NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH THE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WELL WE URGE CAUTION ON THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLORS SERVICE PROGRAM WE DO NOT RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. WHICH IS- SOMEONE CLEAR IN THE AGENDA. WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL FOR THE REGIONAL K. THREE SIXTEEN EDUCATION COLLABORATIVES WHICH HAS DIRECTOR GORDON NOTED IS BEING HEARD IN A DIFFERENT SUB COMMITTEE SO THAT'S A GOOD. TIME FOR ME TO CLARIFY THEIR- MOVING ON THE- THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR A YOUTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAM. COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO EXISTING- PROGRAMS. IN CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT PROVIDE. SOME EMPLOYMENT FOR USE WE RECOMMEND HOWEVER THAT YOU DIRECT TELEPHONE TO AWARD ALL OF THE GRANTS ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL HAS THREE QUARTERS OF THE GRANTS BEING AWARDED- BY AFORMULA. TO THE THIRTEEN LARGEST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA- LESLIE WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STEM TEACHER RECRUITMENT GRANTS BECAUSE IT IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE STATES BROADER TEACHER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS RAISED REGARDING THE OTHER- OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH PROPOSALS BUT WE ARE STILL REVIEWING PROPOSALS RELATED TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND DO NOT AT THIS TIME HAVE SPECIFIC COMMENTS A RECOMMENDATION. ON THOSE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MA'AM I'M GONNA BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE- THE DIOCESE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND SO WE MIGHT JUST WANT TO GIVE COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE DETAILS HERE- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M SAYING MAN- I DO WANT TO- ECHO WHAT B. ELLIE- SAID IN REGARDS TO THE GRANT I WAS LOOKING FOR IT RIGHT NOW THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT. GIVES A MAJORITY THE MONEY TO THE BIG BIG CITIES AND THEN THE REST ON THE COMPETITIVE GRANT ANY ANY FRAMEWORK THAT USES THAT. AS THE MODEL- HAS PROVEN TO BE EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO RURAL CALIFORNIA- AND SO I PROBABLY WON'T VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT THAT IS. WHERE THE BIG CITIES GET A MAJORITY OF THE MONEY AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE EXCEPT THAT. THE CRIME SO- I DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE COMMENTS OTHERWISE I THINK- THERE'S SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS HERE- I GUESS I HAVE I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR HELP ALL IN TEARS AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT IN YOUR WILL HOUSE BUT- I JUST WANT TO GET IT OUT THERE- WE- I HAD A TERRIBLE. A WILDFIRE SEASON LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY DRY AND I WONDER IF WE SET UP A PROGRAM TO- COMMUNICATE WITH THEM FORMER INMATES WHO MAY HAVE SERVED ON THOSE FIRE CREWS WE'VE MADE IT- AN- EASIER FOR THEM TO BE GET HIRED BY THE FIRE SERVICE OR- FOR THE WILDFIRE YEAR IN I'M- I'M WONDERING FOR DOING ANYTHING TO. TO MAKE IT. CLEAR WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE HIRED BY THE STATE. I'M SORRY TO PUT MR FRIDAY ON THE- ON THE HOT SEAT HERE BUT- IF YOU'VE GOT SOME INSIGHTS. HAVING WORKED WORKED WITH THE- YES SIR WITH THE FIRE SERVICE. ANY ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL HE'S IN ANOTHER- AND I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU IN A SPECIFIC ANSWER WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT POPULATION IS VERY MUCH THE INTENDED TARGET FOR THIS PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO HIRE- FOLKS LIKE THAT WHO COME OUT OF THAT PROGRAM AND SO- WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU SPECIFICALLY AND HOW WE WILL BE COMMUNICATING. TO THAT POPULATION BUT THAT IS VERY MUCH THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENTION OF THIS PROPOSAL. ONE GLAD THAT I DO APPRECIATE THAT I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS FROM. FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD. WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE AND I I'VE BEEN AT A LOSS AS TO EXACTLY WHERE TO DIRECT THEM SO- I JUST THINK RIGHT NOW IS A REALLY GOOD TIME TO GET THEM. WORKING IT'S A LOT HARDER TO BE TO RECIDIVIST. RECIDIVISM IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD JOB AND YOU'VE GOT A FUTURE IN THAT JOB SO. SENATOR NELSON YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL PICK UP ON YOUR LATTER POINT. FIRST OF ALL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS EMPTIED THE PRISONS OUT OVER TWO OR THREE ADMINISTRATIONS. THERE AREN'T VERY MANY LEFT. THAT MEANS THAT THE FORCES THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED AS INMATE FIREFIGHTERS REALLY AREN'T THERE. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE BECAUSE THE PLAN IS IT'S CONTINUING TO EMPTY THE PRISONS OUT TILL I GUESS THERE AREN'T ANY. AND MOST OF THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO GO. WORK AT ALL AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THEIR CRIMINAL WORK. EDITORIAL OPINION CONFESSED. THAT'S NOT MY POINT BUT MY POINT IS. AS FAR AS DEALING WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL HELP US ON THE FIRES. ONE PLACE HAS BEEN CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. THEY'VE BEEN A RELIABLE FORCE OF REHABILITATING OR ALL READY TO WORK. INDIVIDUALS WE'VE GOT TO RELY ON THEM. THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SECURE MORE CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS. IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP UP WITH THIS DISASTROUS CIRCUMSTANCE. LET ME HAPPEN- ECHO ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE THAT SHARES CONCERN. ABOUT BIG CITIES VERSUS THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES. IT'S ALMOST AN INSULT TO SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET SO MUCH AND THE LITTLE PLACES ARE GOING TO GET COMPETITIVE GRANTS. I THINK THE BIG CITY SHOULD COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVE THE LITTLE CITIES. THE ADVANTAGE. BIG CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MULTIPLE RESOURCES MONEY SOURCES THROWN AT THEM AVAILABLE TO THEM. IN OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES DO NOT. I'D LIKE US TO START REALIZING THAT AND PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO IT END UP PRIORITIZING IT JUST A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR WELL I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DEFEND THE BIG CITIES- I'M. GLAD HE WALKED IN JUST. HI GOOD GARNISH IT AGAIN THROUGH THIS BEFORE AND IT MAKES YOU WALKED IN. WHAT WHEN YOU DO DOUBLE DUTY ON SO APOLOGIES- YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO- THE- DETAILS I SAY THAT I TOO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GREAT BENEFIT IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS- WHO ARE WORKING WITH YOUNG FOLKS AND MORE MATURE FOLKS- IN PROVIDING A GREAT SERVICE. BUT I WOULD HAVE TO- ALSO SAY THAT I THINK THAT HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SOMEBODY'S IN PRISON BECAUSE I GET TONS ON LETTERS- FROM FOLKS THAT ARE IN PRISON. SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY INVESTEDIN LEARNING- TRADES AND SKILLS THAT WILL HELP THEM FIND EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY GET OUT. AND SO- AN EXAMPLE BEING CAL FIRE OR ACTUALLY- FOR SOME TIME THAT AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER. PROFESSIONS I HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED REALLY THROUGH OUR BNP AND FORMER PENAL CODE OF FROM FOLKS BEING ABLE TO LEARN THAT KIND OF SKILL WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED IN GETTING OUT AND FINDING A JOB IN THAT PARTICULAR TRADE. SO YOU KNOW I AM HOPING THAT AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION OF DOLLARS- THAT WE USE THAT CAL FIRE- LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WAYS THAT WE CAN. OFFER MULTIPLE BENEFITS- IT USING THE SAME KIND OF DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE VALUES OF- THE STATE. OKAY VERY GOOD- THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LA- THAT WE- THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD ISSUE THIS THIS AREA MIGHT BE A GOOD EIGHT AREA TO DEFERRED TO LATER ON IN THE SUMMER- AND NOT TRY TO INCLUDE THIS IN. IN THE JUNE BUDGET- PROPOSAL- BUT WE'LL SEE YOU THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM WE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TODAY. UP BUT WE MAY NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON IT. THIS IS A HOLD OPEN POSITION- ITEM AND SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO OPR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY. WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. MAY REVISE PROPOSAL LIKE TO TURN IT OVER. TO MARK WILSON WHO IS THE ACTING ACTING CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. ACTUALLY MADAM CHAIR THIS IS KIMBERLY HARVESTING FOR FINANCE AND I'LL DO THE REVIEW OKAY SOUNDS GOOD I'LL TAKE ONE FOR THE FINANCE TEAM TODAY. RIGHT WE ARE WE I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE GIVING YOU ENOUGH WORK TO DO. SO THE TEAM EFFORT- SO GOOD I CAN MADAM. AND COMMITTEE MY- I'M CAN REALLY. AND THE DEPART OF FINANCE. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY YOU. FOR YOUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP IN THE EVOLUTION OF CANNABIS OVERSIGHT IN CALIFORNIA I'LL GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. OF THE CANNABIS PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. AND THEN WE HAVE OUR PROJECT LEADERS FROM THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND PUBLIC HEALTH HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU. SO THE FIRST COMPONENT- IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL IS REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN CANNABIS CONTROL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND ONE APPOINTED POSITION AND THAT'S FOR A NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION. THIS POSITION WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN REDUCING BARRIERS. FOR LOCAL EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES. FURTHER SUPPORT DIVERSE WORK FORCES AND CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS EQUITY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND I'D LIKE TO THAT THERE ARE A FEW OTHER EQUITY PROPOSALS INCLUDED. ELSEWHERE IN THE MERRY VISION BUT THEY'RE NOT DUPLICATIVE WITH THIS REQUEST. OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR POSITION WILL BE FOCUSED ON PROMOTING EQUITY WITHIN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY- GEARED TOWARD FOSTERING EQUITABLE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO LICENSURE AND BUSINESS OWNERSHIP IN THE REGULATED CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE MOST HARMED AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BY PREVIOUS CANNABIS CRIMINALIZATION ARE OFFERED ASSISTANCE. AND PRIORITY LICENSING ONE POSSIBLE TO ENTER THE INDUSTRY AS ENTREPRENEURS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF OUR PROPOSAL IS UPDATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR STATUTORY CHANGES- IT SAYS THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE PROPOSE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THEY CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE AUTHORITY NEEDED TO TRANSITION INTO A CONSOLIDATED DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO ISSUE NEW COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSES BY SIX MONTHS SO THAT THEY WOULD GO THROUGH. JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IT MAKES. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE AN LAST. AND REQUIRES THAT THE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. IDENTIFYING STEPS THAT MUST BE TAKEN FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSEES SHOW PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING ANNUALIZED INJURE. AND THE THIRD AND FINAL COMPONENT OF THE MERRY MISSION PACKAGE THIS YEAR. IT IS A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND REQUEST FOR A LOCAL JURISDICTION ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD SUPPORT TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONAL LICENSEES TO ANNUAL LICENSES. ACCIDENTALLY 82% OF CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS LICENSEES ARE PROVISIONALLY LICENSED. THIS FUNDING WILL SERVE OVER IT WILL BE THE DIRECT SUPPORT TO THEM AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO QUANTIFY IT MORE CLEARLY. THE STRUGGLE EIGHT NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND OF THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED PROVISIONAL LICENSES ISSUED BY THE STATE AS OF MAY FIFTH- JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH AND THE FANS ARE INTENDED TO LIGHT TO AID. THE IDENTIFIED LOOK JURIST AND MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY EXPEDITIOUSLY REVIEWING PROVISIONAL LICENSE REQUIREMENTS NOTABLY THOSE RELATED TO SICKLE. AND CAN BE PASSED THROUGH TO LICENSEES FOR THINGS. LIKE MITIGATION MEASURES MEASURES INCLUDING WATER CONSERVATION SO- THAT'S EVERY CAT AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH- LET'S SEE IF THE- ELLIE- HAS ANY COMMENTS. ADAM SHARED BY MEMBERS SO LA. ANALYST OFFICE- WE HAVE COMMENTS ON THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- GRANT PROPOSAL THAT WAS MENTIONED. THIS PROPOSAL RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO USE GENERAL FUND TO OFFSET LOCAL COTS THAT ARE NORMALLY COVERED WITH LOCAL FEES. AND OR LICENSEES PRIVATE FUNDS WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF ANNUAL LICENSURE FOR ONLY A PORTION OF LICENSEES. WHETHER STRUCTURING THE PROGRAM AS A LOAN RATHER THAN A GRAND WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. HOW DCC WOULD ENSURE FUNDING IS PRIORITIZED FOR LICENSEES WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO TRANSITION INTO AN ANNUAL LICENSE HOW DCC WOULD ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO LICENSEES WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE LONG TERM. AND HOW DO YOU SEE C. WILL ENSURE JURISDICTIONS THAT RECEIVED FUNDS OFFER FULLY PURSUE OTHER AVENUES OF EXPEDITING THE TRANSITION TO ANNUAL LICENSES RATHER THAN RELYING SOLELY ON STATE GRANT FUNDS. AND FINALLY WHAT ACTIVITIES DCC WOULD AUTHORIZE FUNDS BE USED FOR BEYOND THOSE EXPLICITLY IDENTIFIED IN THE PROPOSAL. I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE- VISITATION BRING IT BACK TO. THE CENTERED IN NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS A VERY SENSITIVE AREA. INDEED IN MANY RESPECTS. THERE'S MENTION MADE OF CLEANING UP OUR WATERWAYS. THAT'S NOT A NEW PROBLEM IT'S A HISTORIC PROBLEM AND IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. THE GROWERS OUR GREATEST OF ALL POLLUTERS DISREGARDING ANY LOCAL INTEREST WHATSOEVER AND NOT TRYING TO GET ALONG IN FACT THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES. CROCKED THE ILLEGAL GROWERS BURTON FIFTY LEGAL GROWERS THE ILLEGAL I'M SORRY I DID NOT NEED THE LEGAL GROWERS THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. AND DO NOT TRY TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO GRANT MONEY SHOULD GO TO THEM. TO HELP WITH THREE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS. TO HELP IF YOU WILL SUBSIDIZE THEIR LICENSING FEES WHICH I THINK SOME OF THIS IS DIRECTED TO. I JUST CANNOT BUY THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DIRECT ANY MONEY. IN TERMS OF CLEANING UP OUR WATERWAYS WE SHOULD DIRECTION TO LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. WHO CAN THEN SEND DEPUTY SHERIFFS OUT WITH THE WATER BOARD PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE THE GIRL WISH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT POLLUTING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND THEN HOLDING THEM LIABLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE POLLUTERS TO WHAT DEGREE WE CAN LEGALLY TO CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MASH. I THINK WE'RE GOING PROCESS THE VERY WRONG WAY AND IT'S ONLY GETTING. MORE WRONG AS WE PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WHY I MY QUESTIONS WERE SORT OF AROUND- THE EQUITY ISSUES AROUND THE ISSUE OF CANNABIS AND LICENSING- GUYS CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK TO THE WATER ISSUE- BUT THE I IN MY IN MY MIND FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT IN AROUND LOS ANGELES COUNTY WERE DEALING WITH IT THE ATAP MYSTERY OF ISSUES BASED ON THIS VERY PATCHY- COORDINATION- BASED ON VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL ORDINANCES AND HOW THEY ARE EITHER WORKING OR NOT WORKING TOGETHER- COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT. YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN THE INDUSTRY AND NOW ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY IN A LEGALIZED FASHION AND A REALLY HINDERED- BY A SOME OF THE CRITERIA AND THEN AROUND THE LICENSING YOU KNOW AND THEN IF WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION WE'RE GONNA SAY THAT- IN MANY INSTANCES THERE. THESE SORT OF ON TAX BURDENS AND SO FOR THE CONSUMER WHO'S TRYING TO YOU KNOW JUST IN. WE WERE GOING TO BE HONEST HERE IS ABOUT CANNABIS NEED WHAT WE GONNA BUY CANNABIS FOR SEVEN DOLLARS FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE YOU GONNA BUY CANNABIS FOR FIFTY NINE DOLLARS IN SOME OLD MINIMALIST HIPSTER- YOU KNOW STOREFRONT. AND SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO PULL FOLKS INTO THE LEGALIZE MARKET THAT HAS TO COME WITH- A STRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS EQUITY AND HOW WE'RE GIVING OUT THE LICENSES AND OFFERING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE EQUITY IN THE CAPITAL THAT'S NEEDED FOR FOLKS WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING INTO. THIS SPACE LEGALLY- BASED ON EQUITY DISCUSSIONS AND SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS YOU KNOW AND THEN HAVING THAT MANIFEST SO. I GUESS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ECHOED BY THE LA O'S OFFICE YOU KNOW I'M WONDERING WHERE IN THESE PROPOSALS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BECAUSE YOU STILL DON'T WANT IT TO BE THE WILD WILD WEST THERE HAS TO BE COORDINATION- WITH DIFFERENT LOCALITIES. THERE HAS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE WHAT THE GOALS ARE- WITH MAYBE NOT HAVING SO MANY PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND MOVING TOWARDS- NOT HAVING THAT VERY TEMPORARY LIMBO STATE AND THEN ADDRESSING YOUR EQUITY DISPARITIES- THAT HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING. FOR SO MANY FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE. SO AND LIKE DEPARTMENT OF DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M GONNA- DEFER TO OUR EXPERT EVER TOOK PART FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FROM THE- SEQUOIA AND SOME OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT. THANK YOU THIS IS RICHARD CURRENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU'RE COMING IN PERFECTLY. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M I DO WANT TO- ANSWER THAT THE SENATOR'S QUESTION AND SEE IF I COULD TOUCH ON HOW WE DEVELOP TO THIS FORMULA IN LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS COUNTIES AND CITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHERE WE'RE INTENDING. TO PROVIDE THESE FINDS. OUT WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOK AT THE TOP EIGHT JURISDICTIONS. WEST THE MOST THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL LICENSED CANNABIS CULTIVATORS- FOR TWENTY FIVE APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE FINES. ON THE OTHER 25% OF THE FUNDS WE LOOKED AT THE TOP EIGHT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALLOWING FOR LICENSED CANNABIS MANUFACTURING- AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTING TESTING MICRO BUSINESSES AND RETAIL. THE THE OTHER 50% OF THE FINES ARE INTENDED FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT DO HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS. SO IN LOOKING AT- THE BEST WAY TO MAKE USE OF THIS MONEY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. PROVIDE MONEY TO THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THESE LICENSEES THAT WHOLE PROVISIONAL LICENSES- PROVISIONAL LICENSES ARE NOT FULL FULLY APPROVED- FULLY COMPLIANT LICENSES WITH ALL THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AND LICENSE IS WHAT GETS THEM THERE- THE PATHWAY TO FROM A PROVISIONAL LICENSE TO AN ANNUAL LICENSE IS A BIT OF A LEFT SHE- IS ONE OF THE- HURDLES TO GET THROUGH- OUR INTENT HERE IS TO. HELP THESE JURISDICTIONS MOVIES PROVISIONAL LICENSEES INTO ANNUAL LICENSE LICENSURE- THERE THEREBY I'M NOT REMAINING IN LIMBO AND POTENTIALLY- NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT. TO AN ANNUAL LICENSE FOR AND- POTENTIALLY LOSE THEM OUT TO THE- MARK. I'M ONLY GET ONE WE LOOKED OUR NUMBER- THIS IS THIS CAPS OR OR BE TO SEE A PROP SO. PER OF ALL OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSEES IN GETTING TO ANNUAL LICENSURE- D. ACCOUNTABILITY. THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT WOULD RECEIVE THIS FUNDING ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THEIR- THEIR PROPOSED PLAN TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE REVIEWED. THERE WILL BE PERIODIC MONITORING SO THOSE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING USED- FOR WHAT IT'S INTENDED FOR- AND WHERE WE'VE ALSO- WILL BE SPEAKING WITH- FEES ARE PROPOSED JURISDICTIONS. I'M IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON HOW- IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT THESE PLANS. NEED TO TELL. THE CENTER KEMANA. THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE SEEN AS A GOOD PARTNER- IN THE CANNABIS SPACE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT- EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO APPLY YOU KNOW AND COMPLY- BECAUSE I THINK THE GOAL IS FOR. AT LEAST FOR ME BUT FOR OTHERS TO NOT HAVE TO SEE THESE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS COME UP IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEES BECAUSE WE ARE FIGURING OUT A WAY. USING DUE DILIGENCE- AND REALITY TO ADDRESS THIS MARKET YOU KNOW AND TRUTHFULLY AN OPPORTUNITY- IN WAYS THAT BENEFIT THE STATE. AND THIS INDUSTRY SO. JUST MY COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND I AM I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS I THINK WHAT THIS. PROPOSAL ADDRESSES AND I. I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD IN THE SPACE BECAUSE I HAVE A BILL THAT IF WE APPROVE THIS BUDGET DISAPPEARS. SO BUT BUT- AND HAVING HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- STAKEHOLDERS- THE BLOCKAGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WHAT THIS ANTICIPATES IS PUTTING THE RESOURCES OUT TO THE LOCAL. GOVERNMENT TO HELP FIND THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE- THE TESTIMONY AT THE HEARING WAS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN AND LOOKING AT WHETHER IT- THAT PROPERTY SPECIFIC SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IS BEEN DONE APPROPRIATELY- ALL OF THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S A QUESTION OF PUTTING THE RESOURCES. TO CREATING THE ORDINANCES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE THIS FORWARD AND SO- HI I AM A- I THINK THIS. THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY TO LIKE AND NOT LIKE IN THIS WHICH MEANS IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD COMPROMISE- I- APPRECIATE THE- ON. THE THERE WERE THERE WERE THE PROPOSAL IS IT FOR IT TO BE A GRANT PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND I'M THINKING THAT IT MAY BE IT MAY MAKE AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT IF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION EXCEPT ACCEPTS A GRANT AND THEN DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO THAT THERE'S A CALLBACK PERMIT PROVISION I DIDN'T HEAR THAT MENTIONED TODAY BUT IT MAY MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO IT AS A AS A GRANT THAT CAN BE FORGIVEN. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S A LOAN THAT CAN BE FORGIVEN IF YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND YOU START- APPROVING THESE THESE- THESE LICENSES MOVING I'M HEARD FROM PROVISIONAL TO ANNUAL IS REALLY WHAT WE WANT- AND I DO WANNA SECOND WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SAID IS THAT I THINK ALONG WITH THIS PROPOSAL UP WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT AND TO HAVE ILLEGAL DIVERT HERS OF WATER- TO MAINTAIN AN ILLEGAL PRODUCT- IS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS AND I'M TOLD THAT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER I THINK WE OUGHT TO PUT MONEY INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO GO UP THERE AND- TO STOP THE ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS- AND- IT'S A IT'S A WATER BOARD ISSUE AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN. CREATE THESE TEAMS TO GO IN AND DO THE WORK I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT I'VE BEEN INVITED TO GO ON A TOUR WITH THEM SENATOR DOLLY AND I'D BUY AND. PLANT PLAN TO TAKE HIM UP ON THAT. BECAUSE IF IT MEANS WE'D HAVE MORE WATER FOR THE LEGITIMATE USES THAT WE NEED IN THE STATE WE NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT AWAY SO I SECOND WITH MY COLLEAGUE HAS TO SAY SO THIS IS- AND OTHER ITEMS THAT IS EASY. HOLD OPEN. IDMS SO WE WILL DO THAT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY MORE. QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT WHICH IS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUNDING. AND I'D LIKE TO TURN THAT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT- YES GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIRS AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE- ANYTIME HERE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO THE STATE TROOPER INFORMATION OFFICER JOINING ME TODAY AREMY COLLEAGUE SAID CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR RUSS MICHAEL AS WELL AS THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER RICK CLOUGH AS WELL AS THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER. LIANNA BAILEY CRIMMINS- WE ALL HEAR TOO READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE A LET ME START JUST TO PROVIDE FIVE SIMPLE POINT OF- CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ARE THAT MINISTRATION IS ASKING. FIRST OF ALL- THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ASK IS A OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD- AND IS TO FIND- LOOKING TO FIND SMALLER INITIATIVES IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR EACH- WITH A TOTAL OF POSSIBLY TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLIONS OVER THREE YEAR PERIOD- IT IS A MODEL THAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT HAVE HAD THIS TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND ESTABLISHED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND RECENTLY WITH THE INFLUX OF- FURTHER INVESTMENT UPWARDS OF A ONE BILLION DOLLAR INTERNET TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND GIVING THE- IMPORTANT ROLE WITH THAT THAT DIGITAL PLATFORM IF NEEDED. IN GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. AND THAT- SO I WANT TO SURE THAT THE IS NOT A BRAND COST BUT IT'S- A PROGRAM- THIRD BAD THIS FINAL PRETTY. GOING TO BE YOU. FOR ACTUALLY MAIN. WHINY IS TO- PER. A STAR UP FUND IF YOU- TO SERVE SOME OF THE PROOF OF CONCEPT DATA VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO LAUNCH AND THEY MAY NOT BE PERFECTLY FIT INTO THE- BUDGET CYCLE. BUT INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE BUDGET CYCLE THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FUND SOME OF THE INITIATIVE IN THE SMALLER SCALE- SECOND ID IF THERE WERE- HIGH RISK. MISSION CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT WERE DISCOVERED BASED ON THE STABILIZATION EFFORT THAT MY DEPARTMENT HAS PROPOSED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS FINDING WOULD POTENTIALLY HELP TO ACTUALLY MITIGATE SOME OF THE MOST RISK IN A MORE RAPID MANNER INSTEAD OF. WAITING FOR THE FULL- BUT JUST CYCLE. AND THIRD IF THERE ARE SOME- A SECURITY VULNERABILITY THAT WAS DISCOVERED YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HELP WITH THAT EFFORT AS WELL. SO REALLY THOSE ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PARTICULAR FUND- LASTLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MADE CLEAR- AND I BELIEVE THIS IS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE CONCERN THAT. THIS TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND- IT'S NOT SOMETHING I DEVELOPED TO CLINICAL CIRCUMVENT THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WITH THE MUCH LARGER- INVESTMENT- DEEP PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS BUT THE LARGER INVESTMENT CONTINUE TO. EXIST AND IN FACT IF SOME OF THESE PROOF OF CONCEPT YOU KNOW DEVELOPS TO BE. WORTH A LARGER SCALE INVESTMENT A BAD WAY TO GO THROUGH THAT OR COMPLETING THAT PROJECT APPROVALS LIFE CYCLE WHICH INVOLVES LEGISLATIVE- DE OVERSIGHT- LASTLY ONE OTHER THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT. IS TIED TO- WE UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT THE CONCERN TO STAY HEY I SO- WE IS LET. INVOLVED AND IN TODAY'S. THAT MANY THE PAR- WHEN IT COMES TO OF IN A AS SUCH DATE. FIND A WAY TO IT COMES. WITHOUT BIZ THE- TO DEBORAH SENSE INCLUDING RELIGIOUS. OR THE JUST THE FAR DOING THAT AND TELL THINGS BECOME DIRE THEN YOU GET A BIG- INVESTMENT REQUEST TO SAY WE GOT TO DO IT BECAUSE NOW IT'S- A YOU KNOW A BAD. STAGE SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET IN FRONT OF THAT NUMBER ONE THAT WE DID AGREE TO- IF THIS HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE DIED OUT WE WILL BE PROVIDING TWICE A YEAR REPORT. ON THE UTILIZATION OF SUCH FUNDING PROVIDED VISIBILITY THAT OTHERWISE STATE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO GET IN FRONT OF THE SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW MISSION CRITICAL SYSTEM BEFORE THEY BREAK- SO WITHOUT OUR- I WILL WRAP UP MY PRESENTATION AT OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR. SHE'D HERE- YOUR PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO ASK. SINCE IF THEY HAVE A- QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. ISSUES RIGHT FINANCE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY- QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PANEL OFFICE. PRIME MINISTER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL OUR FIRST THE REQUEST WOULD LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT OF I. T. SYSTEM STABILIZATION AND MODERNIZATION EFFORTS BY INCOME BRING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND OVER SEVERAL YEARS WITH ONLY SEMI ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE REPORTING LANGUAGE WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE INVOLVED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN THE REVIEW APPROVAL AND PRIORITIZATION OF THESE EFFORTS ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. SECOND THE REQUEST PROPOSES NO NEW STAUTE TO AUTHORIZE OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY TO GUIDE THE NEW FUND ADMINISTRATION SAYS THE PROPOSAL IS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND PROGRAM BUT THAT PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED BY FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTED SOON THERE AFTER WITH CLEAR POLICY GUIDANCE BY CONTRAST THIS REQUEST INCLUDES SOME EXAMPLES OF CRITERIA TO BE USED. AND PROCESSES TO BE FOLLOWED BUT NONE OF THE EXAMPLES PROVIDED ARE REQUIRED IN STATUTE OR POLICY ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WAY THE STATE BUDGETS FOR THE STABILIZATION AND MODERNIZATION EFFORTS SHOULD BE PROPOSED WITHOUT A MINIMUM TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. THIRD THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE'S IT SYSTEM STABILIZATION AND MODERNIZATION NEEDS THE THREE NEW PROGRAMS PROPOSED BY CITY TEEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET APPROVED BY BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION AND SO WAITING UNTIL CDC IMPLEMENTS THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE HOW BEST TO PRIORITIZE THESE EFFORTS AND SO. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK. YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN I BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE DIET IN C. IF THERE'S ANY KIND. SENATOR NOW. MADAM CHAIR AT A- THE VERY DAY. OBSERVATION FOR. DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH HIGH REGARD FOR THE LEADERSHIP AT THIS AGENCY I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND I FIND THEM TO BE TOP TOP PANTS EXCELLENT PEOPLE VERY DEDICATED VERY SINCERE. I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST THE FACT THAT THIS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN A MESS EVER SINCE IT STARTED. NOW IT'S BEEN IMPROVING AND I GIVE THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT HAPPENING. BUT IT'S STILL A PROBLEM AGENCY WHY. MOST RECENTLY ET D. ANOTHER TERRIBLY PROBLEMATIC AGENCY HAD TWO CRASHES AND BURNS OF A THAI TEA APPOINTMENT AT A CRITICAL MOMENT. WHERE OUR CITIZENS ARE SUFFERING GRIEVOUSLY. BY THE INCOMPETENCE OF THAT AGENCY AND I WONDER I CAN'T QUIT GOES DOWN. THE ISSUE IS THAT FOR DECADES FAR PRE DATING THIS LEADERSHIP- BEEN PUT THERE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MESS. AND I FEEL FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S A FORMIDABLE MASS. BUT FOR DECADES THESE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS HAVE NEVER COME IN ON TIME THEY'VE NEVER COME IN ON BUDGET. AND I FOR THE I. T. COMPANIES THEMSELVES. FOR THE WAY THIS IS ALL COME DOWN. THEY ARE EXPLOITING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER FOR THEIR OWN BOTTOM LINE ADVANTAGES. GIVING US A QUICK BUT THAT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS PROMISED. BUT BUT RATHER OFFERS HOLLOW PROMISES. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE DARE NOT AT THIS TIME GIVE UP ANY MORE OF OUR REVIEW AUTHORITY OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY AND THE SANCTIONING AUTHORITY MEANING THAT WE AND I AND CORPORATE A LITTLE BIT OF GENERAL SERVICES IN THIS TOO I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN UP SOME GUILT IN THE NEGOTIATION OF CONTRACTS. SO WE CAN'T WE CAN'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY IT'S COSTING US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOT DELIVERING. THAT WHICH HAS BEEN PROMISED BY THE I. T. COMPANIES AND THIS IS THE I. T. CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. IT SHOULD BE A HUGE EMBARRASSMENT TO CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE THIS CONTINUE. WELL SAID- SENATOR I IDEA I FEEL THE SAME WAY I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING THERE AND- YET I ALSO FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT. ADD INTO THAT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL- I WHEN I HEARD THE LA- SAY AND I AGREE IS THAT THERE THEY HAVE TO BE PARAMETERS AROUND IF YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE A POT OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS KIND OF INNOVATIVE WORK AND I SUPPORT. I SUPPORT IT- THAT THERE HAVE TO BE- SOME- SOME WAY FOR US TO EVALUATE WHETHER YOU ACTUALLY ACHIEVED. THE SUCCESS IN THE PROVINCE THE EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES SO- THIS IS PROBABLY- AT A SUBJECT FOR A FUTURE DATE WELL IT'S HOLD OPEN I. ITEM SO WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- THAT THIS THE EDITOR SOME PLICY ISSUES HERE THAT ARE IMPORTANT- AND THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND IT WE MAY NEED TO BILL. RATHER THAN AT THAT THROUGH A BUDGET- PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET US THERE- SO HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER- ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY TWO. T IS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS COMPLEX SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS. SO WE WILL ASK. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PRESENT THIS.

CONSOLIDATE PERSONNEL LOCATED IN SEVERAL LEASE BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT SACRAMENTO INTO A SINGLE COMPLEX AFTER THE RECENT CHALLENGES THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH YOU AT THAT IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST WEEK. THESE FUNDS WILL HELP STEER THE PROJECT BACK ON TRACK AND MAINTAIN ITS TRAJECTORY TOWARDS COMPLETION. WITH THE ADDITION OF THESE FUNDS TO ASSIST WITH PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSPECTION SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT ENGINEERING SUPPORT SERVICES. BOTH CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND THE CONTRACTOR OF THE PROJECT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESUME ONSITE ACTIVITIES QUICKLY A PARTNER- MEETINGS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN LAST WEEK TO START ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK- THAT HAD TO RESTART THE PROJECT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD. GOOD ANALYSTS OFFICE. HERE'S OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. I THOUGHT LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE AREN'T ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WE DID HAVE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BRIEFING ON THIS EARLIER- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS BACK ON TRACK AND- IT'S DISAPPOINTING TO BE IN THIS POSITION WHERE. OUR OWN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS GETS- RED TAGGED AND SO THE SOONER THAT WE CAN GET ON WITH THE TASK OF BRINGING THIS UP. IT UP TO CODE AND DO IT IN A SAFE WAY- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO THIS IS A HOLDOVER HOLD OPEN ITEM. OUT SO WE WILL DO THAT AND- WE'LL MOVE ON THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WILL MOVE ON TO.

FIVE- BILLION DOLLARS TO- ADD TO THIS CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANT FUND AND I DO BELIEVE ON THE ARMED OFFICE OF FINANCE IS ON BOARD FOR COMMENT. VERY GOOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDED JUST A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THREE DIGITAL ROUNDS OF GRANTS. IN ADDITION FIFTY NINE DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO YOU THE- ROUND OF FUNDING FOR NONPROFIT CULTURE INSTITUTIONS ONLY THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT BEING AWARDED SO THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES STATUTORY CHANGES TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL ROUND- GRANTS TO FOR THE RAIN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. EVERY INTERNET QUESTIONS- AND OF COURSE I GO THERE'S A LINE. FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MOVING ON TO THE LEAD. ANALYST'S OFF. THANK YOU SENATOR KABIRU WHETHER FORD LATEST ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE HOPE WE CAN PUT SOME THE AMOUNTS IN CONTEXT TO DATE THE PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE APPLICATIONS AND WAS ABLE TO FIND AND THE PROPOSED FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND MORE GRANTS. AND THE GRANTS ARE FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE APPLICANT'S GROSS REVENUE AND SO WE ESTIMATE THAT ANOTHER. THREE HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO FIND ALL OF THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO DATE- THE STAFF AND THE AGENDA NOTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE- CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR STAFF TO HELP THINK ABOUT SOME VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES. ON THE MAY REVISION ALSO REALLOCATE SIXTEEN MILLION FOR NON PROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT WAS NOT AWARDED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR A SECOND ROUND OF NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS GRANTS IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- GO BUSINESS SUGGESTED THAT AN AUDITION- ROUND OF GRANTS COUPLED WITH TARGETED OUTREACH MIGHT INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR. COMFORT RELIEF PROGRAM AMONG THIS GROUP. HOWEVER IT'S NOT POSSIBLE THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL DEMAND MAY NOT MATERIALIZE AND WE WOULD SUGGEST STOPPING SOME BUDGET BILLING WHICH THEY GIVE SCOPE IS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. OUTSIDE THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE CAN WORK WITH- STUFF ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT- UP. FLEXIBILITY IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT. THE IDEA THAT WE MAY WANT TO. REDO THE DIFFERENT- PHASES OR I THINK RECALLING ON. ROUNDS RIGHT ROUNDS- SO- WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR CONCERNS- SO I DO HAVE A UP A COMMENT IN A CONCERN THIS IS THIS- SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS SUCCESSFUL AND YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN IN- MANAGING THE PROGRAM AND GETTING THE RESOURCES OUT TO LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND I'VE BEEN OUT SPEAKING TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT AND- I HAVE HEARD. SOME GOOD THINGS- SO THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAM AND ADDING A NUMBER OF ROUNDS IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THERE THE GRANT APPLICATION IS ONLY IN ENGLISH AND- GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY DO THAT GRANT APPLICATION WHICH IS FAIRLY BASIC IN OTHER- PRIMARY LANGUAGES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO I'M I'M RAISING THAT NOW BECAUSE I. HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT MANY PEOPLE COULDN'T ACCESS THE INFORMATION NECESSARY OR COULDN'T FILL OUT THE APPLICATION IN A WAY THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH RESOURCES. AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME NOT TO HAVE. I HAVE- ENOUGH IN SPANISH AND ONE IT'S NOT THAT IT'S- FOR L'INDUSTRIE TO TRANSLATE NUMBER TWO. AND THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THIS PROGRAMME SO- I WOULD REQUEST THAT. WE CONSIDER MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT IT FRANKLY IN CALIFORNIA. TO OFFER. RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY AND ONLY DO IT IN ENGLISH I ONLY DO THE APPLICATION IN ENGLISH BECAUSE I KNOW I PARTICIPATED IN THE NUMBER OF. OF WORKSHOPS IN IN SPANISH AND SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT AND HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT THAT COMES THROUGH- THE M. THE DEPARTMENT IN A MINUTE THANK YOU FOR DOING THOSE WORKSHOPS IN IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH THEY'VE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO DO IT IN SPANISH SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION WHICH I THINK IT'S JUST AN ISSUE THIS IS A HOLD- OPEN ITEM- SO WE ARE GONNA. WE ARE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN. JANITOR AT MY KNEE YES D. LIMITATION ON MY MIND THE APPLICATION BEING RUSSIA'S ROLE ON ABOUT THE BANKING SOFTWARE AND ARE WHERE. THERE ATTACKS MEANING WE WENT BEYOND- JUST WEBINARS AND OUTREACH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ARE WE PROVIDED SAMPLE APPLICATIONS IN YOUR LANGUAGE SO THAT APPLICANTS WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE APPLICATION IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE WELL FOR HAVING. TO HAVE IT. COMPLETE I FOR SYDNEY. SEPARATELY ON WE ARE IN LEVERAGE TO OUR OF PARTNERS. AND WILL PROVIDE TAX WAS SERVICES IN LANGUAGE FOR THIRTY DIFFERENT. AND WORKING I SENT FOUR DIFFERENT ETHNIC MEDIA AT IN EACH. THAT IT WILL WIDELY KNOWN THAT THERE WAS RESOURCE WERE. THANK YOU THAT AND I DO A ALL OF THE I JUST. I GUESS I'VE- HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU CAN'T. HAVE A PLATFORM IN- IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR COMPLICATED. DATA FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY DID NOT RUN THE PROGRAM LIKE THAT PPP PROGRAM THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HE DID AND SO- I UNDER I-UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN SAID IT'S HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE THEIR BANK THEIR BANKING OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. TYPE OF FORMS BUT FRANKLY- I JUST I AM JUST NOT COMMENCED AND- YOU KNOW OFFLINE WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND YOU CAN TRY TO CONVINCE ME THAT THESE FORMS ARE REALLY COMPLICATED AND THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR INFORMATION THAT. LEADS TO HARD TO TRANSLATE BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A REALLY LONG TIME IN TERMS OF- A SPANISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS- OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN PARTICULAR AND IT'S NOT JUST NOT THAT DIFFICULT SO- I BUT I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE I KNOW. IRAN LONG RUN TERM SORRY LONG TERM BUDGET CONDITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. YES SENATOR NELSON. MADAM CHAIR I MOVED TO COMMENT THIS IS A SMALL ITEM. I STIPULATE. BUT MAYBE NOT SO SMALL I THINK A LOT OF US ARE GETTING VERY TIRED. THE FILM AND MOVIE BUSINESS. PROSELYTISING AS THEY ARE AND USING THEIR BULLY PULPIT EXPLOITING THEIR OWN FREE SPEECH. TO DIMINISH OR CENSOR OTHER PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH. IF THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA BY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. IT MIGHT BE WELL FOR THEM TO MODIFY SOME OF THEIR SCREED. I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF THAT IS JUST A POLITICAL STATEMENT ON MY PART BUT I BELIEVE IT IS ONE THAT SHARED BY AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NELSON- I DON'T HAVE ANY. CAN IN REGARDS TO THIS. BUDGET ITEM IT IS A WHOLE OPEN I SO I. WE'RE GONNA SIT BACK AGAIN. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE FRENCH I TAX BOARD. ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE IS THE GOAL STATE STIMULUS TO POINT OH. WILL TURN THE MIKE OVER TO DEPARTMENT OF FACT- ME SEE HERE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'LL BE PRESENTING ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU YOU SAVE ME. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN A IN MARCH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE STATE ENACTED THE FIRST GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. WHICH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE. AT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC. YES THIS ONE PROVIDED SIX ON OUR PAYMENTS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT QUALIFIED FOR THE I. T. C. AND TWENTY TWENTY TWELVE AT OUR PAYMENTS TO UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES A QUALIFIED FOR THE I. T. C. A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENTS TO UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES. MAKING UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE I. T. C. THE STATE'S SECOND GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSED HERE IS- REPRESENT. CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE GIRLS TEXTING US AND TARGETS LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH AN ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON FAMILIES IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION IN TAX REBATES TO ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS AND OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS GSS TWO HAS THREE WAYS TO QUALIFY FOR PAYMENT ONE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT TO ALL TAX. FILERS FILING A TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURN WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS WHO DID NOT ALREADY RECEIVE A- GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. TO A FIVE IN OUR PAYMENT TO ALL TAXPAYERS WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS WITH A DEPENDENT ON RETURN. AND THREE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS WITH THE DEPENDENT ON THE RETURN. UNDER GSS TO TAXPAYERS CAN QUALIFY FOR MULTIPLE PAYMENTS SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS WHISPER C. ONE THOUSAND OR ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN TOTAL. THIS PROPOSAL HAS A SECONDARY pCONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT UNDER STAT APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT TO ALLOCATE EXCESS REVENUES EQUALLY BETWEEN TAX REBATES AND SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT THE STAFF PROPOAL THAT FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS REQUESTING LIMITED TERM RESOURCES FOR ACCESS I'M SORRY REV LIMITER RESOURCES FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TOTALING THREE POINT FOUR MILLION WITH FULL DETAILS INCLUDED IN THE B. C. P. FOR IMPLEMENTATION RELATED TO STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IT IS REQUESTED THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE BE ADDED TO S. U. THE GENERAL FUND ITEM OF APPROPRIATION. FOR THE MINISTRY OF COST OF PROCESSING AND DISPERSING THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTANT STIMULUS PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IS INCLUDED IN SCO'S MAY REVISION FINANCE LETTER. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVE MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ACTUALLY THERE WAS A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITHIN IT YEP. LOOKING AT MY NOTES AND TRYING TO ORGANIZE MYSELF SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE LA- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU CHAZ ALLEN OVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- YESTERDAY AFTERNOON OUR OFFICE RELEASED AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A SECOND ROUND OF GOLDEN STATE'S STIMULUS PAYMENTS- MUCH OF THE CONTENT ON OUT. OF THAT ANALYSIS IS IN YOUR AGENDA TODAY SO I'LL BE BRIEF- THE SECOND ROUND AS PROPOSED IN INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION IS A BROADER ROUND OF STIMULUS PAYMENTS IN THE FIRST ROUND. AS MR WHITE MENTIONED. MINISTRATION ESTIMATES IN THE SECOND ROUND WILL TOTAL EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR PAYMENTS FOR FAMILIES WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME UP. TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. I THE COST OF SECOND ROW IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN DOUBLE THE COST OF THE FIRST ROUND AND THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT WOULD REACH A LARGER NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER. INCOME THRESHOLD. BACK IN JANUARY WHEN WE WERE FIRST EVALUATING THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST RADICAL STATE SINGLES PAYMENTS. WE NOTED THAT ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS TIME THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO PROVIDE PANDEMIC RELIEF IS LIMITED. AND SO MINDFUL THAT WE POINTED OUT THAT I NEVER REALLY FOR THE STATE SHOULD FIRST TARGET THOSE MOST IN NEED. AND SECONDLY TRY TO FILL IN GAPS WHERE FEDERAL AID HASN'T REACHED. OUT AND LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S SECOND GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY. OF STIMULUS PAYMENTS WOULD GO TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH ALREADY RECEIVED FEDERAL CHECKS. FROM THE THREE STAGES OF FEDERAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS- ALTHOUGH. BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND ROUND. THERE ARE PURPLE DID INCLUDE TAXES TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO FILE TAXES USING AN ITEM- COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING THESE HOUSEHOLDS. WOULD HAVE RECEIVED MUCH LESS IN COMBINED STATE AND FEDERAL AID- THAN OTHER SIMILAR HOUSEHOLDS- IN THE ANALYSIS WE'VE PUBLISHED. I WAS SHOWN IN FIGURE THAT OUT- HOUSE OF FOUR WITH TWO ADULTS AND TWO CHILDREN THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ALL FEDERAL AID WOULD RECEIVE JUST NORTH OF TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL AID AND STATE AID- COMBINE TO DATE WHEREAS ANOTHER Y. SIMILAR HOUSEHOLD BUT WITH UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO FILE THEIR TAXES USING AN I. TEN I WOULD RECEIVE JUST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO MINDFUL OF THIS INEQUITY IN- WE PUT FORTH SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED MORE ACTIVELY TARGET LIMITED STATE FUNDS TO UNDOCUMENTED HOUSEHOLDS WHO FILE USING AN ITEM ON. THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT THERE WE PUT FORTH. THE FIRST RECALL THE EXPAND PROPOSAL WOULD SIMPLY BE TO ADD TO THE GOVERNORS EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSED AMOUNT AND USE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO INCREASE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO HEIGHTEN HOUSEHOLDS- YES MADE BY. ADDING JUST FOR EXAMPLE TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT TO HEIGHTEN HOUSEHOLDS COULD BE INCREASED TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ITEM HELSEL. OUR SECOND ALTERNATIVE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATIONS WHAT WE CALL THE RE DIRECT ALTERNATIVE AND THIS WOULD WORK WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AMOUNT BUT INSTEAD REDIRECT FUNDS OR SHIFT ON- FOR EXAMPLE. THE EXPANSION COULD BE LIMITED TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS INSTEAD OF UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THESE FUNDS COULD BE REDIRECTED INSTEAD TO INCREASE PAYMENTS. TO HOUSEHOLDS- FILE USING A HIGH TECH UNDER THIS EXAMPLE WE THANK THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS. COULD BE INCREASED TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON JUST A COUPLE OF. WERE- OVIOUSLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND- ALL THE MEMBERS ON THE OTHER OPTION AS A CONSIDERS THE GOVERNOR'S. GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I'M APPRECIATE THEIR ERA. YOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS THERE IT'S VERY HELPFUL. BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I SEE NO NO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR NIELSEN- SO LET ME LET ME JUST- ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO- YOU KNOW ANYTIME WE ROLL OUT THESE PROGRAMS IT'S IT IT IS IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE COMMUNITY EDUCATION BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION- THE LAST TIME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS THE ONE ONE POINT NO- THERE WERE THERE WERE THERE WAS RESOURCES- THERE WERE RESOURCES FOR- TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO EITC. RECIPIENTS AND SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS- IS WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND- WHAT KIND OF MONEY IS PROPOSED FOR. INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY NEED TO EITHER RE FILE THEIR THEIR TAXES OR- THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MONEY AND THAT- HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MONEY CAN ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT. I'M SO I'LL START OFF BY SAYING THAT THE- THE- THE WAY THIS IS GOING TO WORK IS FOR THAT TAX FILERS HAVE ALREADY FILED A TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURNS SO. THERE WILL BE NO URTHER ACTION REQUIRED BY BY TAXPAYERS AND PARTY FILED A TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURN FRANCHISE. TAX BOARD WILL WORK WITH. THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN ORDER TO GET TO GET PAYMENTS OUT TO- TAPS TO THOSE FILERS. SO IF YOU'RE ON IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT OUT REACHED OUT SPECIFICALLY FOR LIKE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THEN I CAN TURN THAT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THAT WOULD BE FINE. GOOD AFTERNOON TURKS AMIDST PARTNER FINANCE. THE MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THE COUNTY THE ITC PROGRAM. PARTICIPATION AMONG ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO RISE. BECAUSE THERE'S A MUCH GREATER AWARENESS OF THE COUNTY ITC PROGRAM AS IT ENTERS ITS SIXTH YEAR AND BECAUSE AVAILABLE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT OUTREACH IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER PARTICIPATION RATES. THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT POSE IN THE AVERAGE FUNDING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO IT'S SO THE- THE ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN-ZEROED OUT IN OTHER WORDS. THAT IS CORRECT. SO- MATT WHAT MY BIG CONCERN I HAVE IS THIS THAT THE DATA THAT THAT I RECALL RECEIVING BECAUSE I DID I DID A BUILT. IN THIS AREA. THAT REQUIRES IF TB DID DO A REPORT. ON HABIT ON WHETHER THERE'S A PROCESS THAT WE CAN UTILIZE. TO EXPEDITE OR TO. IDENTIFY THOSE IN THAT ARE L. FOR E. I. IT IS THE BIGGEST POVERTY PROGRAM THAT WE AND WE DO A IN CONTROL WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO THE OPERA TO GET- THAT EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING BUT ARE STILL POOR AND HAVE- HAVE HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE ARE GOING ON AND MATT IS REALLY IMPORTANT- MY BILL REQUIRES IT F. T. B. CREATE A REPORT TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO IDENTIFY. THOSE WORKERS AND ADVISE THEM THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE AND OUT WITH THE POTENTIAL OF NOT HAVING TO FILE RETURN FOR IT THAT THEY RECEIVE A LETTER ADVISING THEM THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE IN ORDER TO FILE A RETURN. ON THAT. WHEN I DID THAT BILL THAT WAS IN THERE WAS AN EIGHTY. THE DATA SHOWED. THAT WE WERE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUTREACH. AND EDUCATION AND THAT WE WERE STILL MISSING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE ELIGIBLE WORKERS. IN OUR STATE. AND I DON'T SEE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY DATA. THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THAT SOMEHOW THAT. POPULATION HAS BECOME EDUCATED NOW AND THEY DON'T NEED ANY MORE RESOURCES SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ZEROING OUT ANY KIND OF ASSISTANCE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STIMULUS THE ATC PORTION OF THE STIMULUS. THIS IS JAMIE HARRIMAN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD I CAN KIND OF JUMP IN AND REGARDS TO SENATOR CAMEO YOUR REPORT REQUIRED UNDER SENATE BILL FORTY NINE NINETY. WE ARE CERTAINLY WORKING ON NOT IT IS TO THE LEGISLATURE- TOWARDS THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND WE WILL CERTAINLY- LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS IN REGARDS TO THAT. I WOULD SAY THERE IS- INCONSISTENT DATA THAT EXISTS IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THERE IS A CAP AND WHAT THAT GOT LOOKS LIKE- FOR PURPOSES OF OUTREACH- MISTER WHITE IS CORRECT THAT INDIVIDUALS FOR THE MOST PART HAVE FILED THEIR RETURNS ARE READY. THAT ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE JEEP. THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TO. SO THAT THERE REALLY NO FURTHER ACTION NECESSARY ON THEIR PART. HOWEVER THERE ARE FOLKS THAT FILE LATE. AT NIGHT AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY FOLKS THAT TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE A FILING REQUIREMENT AND MAY BE INTERESTED IN NOW FILING BECAUSE OF THE GOLDEN STATE STREET MILLER SO. THE GRANT FUNDS OF FIVE BILLION THAT WERE AUTHORIZED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR FROM THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS ONE. THERE IS- MOST LIKELY SOME LEFT AND THEN THERE AND THAT AMOUNT WILL BE CARRIED OVER INTO THE FIRST PART OF THIS COMING UP THIS SCHOOL YEAR. SO THAT THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAN IN FACT CONTINUES SOME EDUCATION OUTREACH- WITH THOSE PRIOR FUNDS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED BUT THIS YEAR BUT WILL BE SUBJECT TO RE APPROPRIATION. FOR NEXT YEAR. THE HELP CENTER THE QUESTION- IT IT MAY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE SOME ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD NOT- TOTALLY EXPANDED THE RESOURCES THAT. THEY RECEIVED IN IN REGARDS TO HELPING. IN THIS AREA AND THAT THEY IT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AND IT IS AN EXTENSION TO BE ABLE TO- CONTINUE TO OFFER HELP AND ASSISTANCE AND SO. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING THE RESOURCES- YES AVAILABLE EXACTLY SO OKAY APARTMENT EFFECT HAS BEEN- A GOOD PARTNER WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS. INCORPORATED INTO PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WITHIN OUR BUDGET THAT WILL ALLOW PORTIONS OF THAT FIVE MILLION AGAIN GRANTED IN FEBRUARY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXPENDED AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWO CAN BE SUBJECT TO- EXPENDITURE AND- THAT. THE FIRST PART OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OKAY THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK AND THEN AND THEN- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE I. TEN HOLDERS AND THOSE THAT DO NOT% HAVE AN I. TEN- AND- THAT- SO THE CONCERN I HAVE IS OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION TO THE NON I. TEN- GRANTEES IS THERE A PROCESS THEY'RE USING OR AM I AGAIN I'M EXPECTING THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. THAT THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BUDGET IS THERE YEAH HOW IS IT THAT YOU INTEND TO COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY ANY RELIEF PROGRAM NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS THERE THE MOST DESPERATELY IN NEED OF HELP BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS ANY RESOURCES. YES A GOOD QUESTION SO I CAN KIND OF- START THAT CONVERSATION AND OTHER FOLKS CAN STOP AND- SHOW- THE NONPROFITS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE WORKING WITH ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS GROUP AND ARE CERTAINLY MAKING EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS- SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE PROCESS GOING WITH THE- WITH THE IRS. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE AN I. TEN- OUR INFORMATION CURRENTLY SUGGESTS THAT WHEN SHE APPLIED FOR AN I. TEN IT COULD TAKE ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN TO ELEVEN WEEKS. AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR TO GET ONE SO- OUR PHONE LINES ARE WEBSITES- OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS ARE ALL AWARE OF THIS TIME FRAME AND ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THESE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS THAT MAY BE FINDING OUT ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE STREET RELEASED FOR THE FIRST TIME- WHETHER ONE OR THE FIRST OR THE SECOND- PROPOSAL. CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT RIGHT TEN IT IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE- PARTICULARLY FOR GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS ONE. THAT AN ACTION IS NECESSARY- BOTH CLAIM THE CALIFORNIA E. H. U. G. AND TO GET THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS SO- WE HAVEN'T SEEN LANGUAGE YET FOR THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PACKAGE TO BUT- AGAIN. CONVERSATIONS HAVE SEEMINGLY BECAUSE THAT AN ITEM ISN'T NECESSARY SO WE'RE MAKING EVERY ATTEMPT TO MAKE SURE TAXPAYERS THAT CONTACT US AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY. KNOW HOW TO GET AN I. TEN WHERE TO GO WHAT DOCUMENTS DO YOU NEED TO GET IT AND TO GET THAT IN THE WORKS. SO THAT THEY CAN GET THAT . TENDON AND FILE A RETURN TICKET- GENERATE THIS PAYMENT AT THIS TIME. VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- YOUR INFORMATION IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL I JUST- I. WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT AGAIN THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS WILL BE SAYING THIS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. BUT- THERE'S A- COOL A PROGRAM ONLY SIX AS THE OUT REACH AN AGE. IS PRETTY. BECAUSE TO REACH POP. AND I THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR IT THE COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO DO THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING SO- ONE I I'M- MY URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER. AS PART OF THIS- TRAILER BILL THAT THAT IT INCLUDES SOME RESOURCES FOR. FOR THE PARTNERS AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IF WE'RE DOING A STIMULUS THAT IT GOES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY THAT IT IS A DESIGN TO BENEFIT. SO SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATE THAT HERE TODAY. THIS IS A- HOLD OPEN ITEM THREE TO MOVE ON TO ITEM ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX. WHICH IS THE HOMELESS HIRING TAX CREDIT. AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE LA O'S OFFICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS BRAND WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND- D. ON THIS ITEM IS A PART OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN OR AT LEAST IT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE PLAN FOR A PROPOSAL FOR A HOMELESS HIRING TAX CREDIT. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYERS THAT HIRE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS TO CLAIM A CREDIT THAT COULD BE USED TO REDUCE THEIR STATE PERSONAL INCOME AND- CORPORATION TAXES. AS STATED IN THE AGENDA THE- THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STREAMLINE THE HIRING OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING INCENTIVES. TO BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CREDIT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. OUR OFFICE IS LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO CLEAR UP ANY FACTUAL DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL. TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND I UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE ANOTHER PANELIST WHO CAN SPEAK TO- SOME THE POLICY MERITS. VERY GOOD I UNDERSTAND THAT- BOB LANTER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION IS HERE. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME AND SEE- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE VERY YOU'RE THE VOICE IS VERY LOW IF YOU COULD. KIND OF TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC. WHEN I TRY THAT AGAIN. HOW'S THAT CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT GREAT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CABALLERO AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BOB LANTER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION A NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION MADE UP OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS I THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO GET SOME BACKGROUND TODAY ON THE HOMELESS HIRING TAX CREDIT. THAT WAS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS A WAY TO HELP THE STATE ADDRESS THE GROWING HOMELESS CRISIS TODAY I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON HOW THIS TAX CREDIT WILL SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM. HOW IT WILL HELP THE STATE AS IT LOOKS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND HOW THIS CAN BE A HELPFUL ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE HEART OF THIS TAX CREDIT FOR THE WORKFORCE BOARDS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND CONTINUANCE OF CARE THAT WORKED CLOSELY WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO HELP THEM GET THE ASSISTANCE THEY DESPERATELY NEED. THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE NOT JUST PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE JOB BUT TO INCLUDE THIS IS ANOTHER USEFUL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED WHEN HELPING THESE INDIVIDUALS FIND HOUSING JOB TRAINING FOOD ASSISTANCE AND THE MANY OTHER WAYS. THAT THESE CONTINUANCE OF CARE CAN HELP. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE WILL BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THIS PROCESS. SERVING AS A LINK BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THEIR BUSINESS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND A KNOWLEDGE OF MAIN STREET LABOR MARKET DATA. AND CAN HELP BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES CONNECT TO THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE CASE MANAERS WILL SUPPORT THOSE INDIVIDUALS BEING HIRED WITH THEIR CENTRAL SUPPORTS AND HOUSING AGENCIES ARE HEALTH CARE SITES AS NEEDED. THE CULTURAL COMPETENCIES WITHIN THESE LOCAL BOARD STAFF FOR ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORTING. BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE AND ENSURING THAT THE RETENTION AND LONG TERM SUCCESS CAN COME FROM HIRING THROUGH THIS TAX CREDIT. THE HOMELESS HIRING TAX CREDIT SERVICES A TOOL TO HELP SOLVE THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS BY MATCHING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. WITH JOBS THAT MUST PAY FAMILY SUPPORTING WAGES AT OR EXCEEDING THE JURISDICTIONS PREVAILING WAGE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE TAX CREDIT. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING TO HIRE FOR HIRING SAKE. BUT TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND INCENTIVIZE IT AND INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS. TO HIRE THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. IN ORDER TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE CREDIT. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A STANDALONE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND THAT THERE IS A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PAID. HIGHER WAGES AND ARE EMPLOYED FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND CAN COUPLE THIS EMPLOYMENT WITH OTHER ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THE PARAMETERS INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL REGARDING HIRING ARE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE ODDS OF SUCCESS. AND ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND MOVE. OFF OF THEIR STATE PROGRAMS. ALL RIGHT NOW IS SHOWS FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND DOLLARS SPENT THE STATE WOULD SAVE ROUGHLY THIRTY ONE MILLION ON CAL WORKS IN MEDICARE. BY HELPING THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE SAVINGS IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS IN MEDICARE. BUT IT CAN BE AND THEN MENTALLY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR THE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AS THEY LOOK TO RE OPEN THEIR DOORS AND REHIRE EMPLOYEES. AS YOU ARE AWARE PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT HARD RECENTLY AND A POTENTIAL TEN THOUSAND TAX CREDIT PER. INDIVIDUAL HIRED COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR ABILITY TO RE OPEN AND STAY OPEN AND THE UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME THAT WOULD SEE THEM CLOSE THEIR DOORS PERMANENTLY. IN CLOSING. CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT OVER THIRTEEN BILLION ON ALMOST THIS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ANOTHER TWELVE BILLION AND HAS MADE REVISED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. FOR YOU TODAY IS A PROPOSED SOLUTION THAT CAN HELP DISPONIBLE POPULATION. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COST FOR THE STATE. AS WELL AS HELP BUSINESSES RECOVER AND HELP THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SURGED BACK TO WHERE IT WAS PRETTY BAD DAMAGE. WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THIS. AFTERNOON HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GOING TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THEY'D LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU- I'M SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME- WE SUPPORT A TWELVE BILLION DOLLAR PLAN OUTLINED IN THE MAY REVISION TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO USE THE STATE'S HISTORIC REVENUE SURGED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE- THE COMMITTEE SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET I DON'T. SEEING NONE I AM. I THINK THIS IS BUT THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO CONNECT THIS TO THE HOMELESS SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUNDING- SEEMS TO ME THAT HAVING A JOB IS ONE REALLY IMPORTANT STEPBUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE IT BECOMES REALLY HARD TO KEEP THAT JOB- WHICH IS JUST I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY CAN. CAN WORK AND LIVE OUT OF THE CAR LIVE LIVE ON. ON THE STREET SO CONNECTING IT TO THE HOMELESS SERVICES ARM THE OTHER THING IS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN- WE CAN DO THIS AS A- AS A PILOT PROJECT TO SEE IF IT. IF IT. IF IT DOES AT THE COMPLEX THE GOALS THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS. REDUCE THE COST TO THE- IN IN OUR SERVICE PROGRAMS THE MORE THE PEOPLE ARE INDEPENDENT AND CAN WORK. THE LESS THEY HAVE TO RELY ON SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS- AND- AND SEE IT AS AN ECONOMIC DRIVER IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL O.

WAGE REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN A KEY POLICY FOR PROTECTING THE WELL BEING OF OUR NATION'S WORKERS IN THE COMING CRISIS HOWEVER UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE THE ONLY GROUP PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AS A RESULT THE CODED CARCASSES HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. IN OUR ANALYSIS- FROM- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CONTENTS OF THAT FILE WE FOUND AT THE FOOT IN THE FIRST TEN MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. IMMIGRANTS COMPRISE 35% OF PANDEMIC RELATED DEATHS AMONG WORKERS AGED PERSONS BUT THEY ACCOUNTED 4403% OF PANDEMIC RELATED DEATHS AMONG WORKERS AND THOSE INDUSTRIES AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF THE SPREAD OF KOBE AGRICULTURE FOOD PROCESSING RESTAURANT EMIGRANTS WERE 58% OF PANDEMIC RELATED. ENABLING WAGE REPLACEMENT ALLOWS WORKERS TO TAKE TIME OFF FOR COVERT SYMPTOMS TO CARE FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE HOME FROM SCHOOL TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER TO COPE WITH THE DEVASTATING LOSS OF A LOVED% ONE. THE PINNACLE PROTEST TO PANIC ATTACKS A NATION OR TO DEAL WITH THE VACCINATION SIDE EFFECTS AND CONTRARY TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE ABOUT LATINOS BEING BACKED INTO THE TENT AND NEEDING EDUCATION A RECENT SURVEY BY KAISER HEALTH NEWS FOUND THAT UNVACCINATED LATINOS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO WANT A COVERT ACTION ACTION THAN WHITES OR BLACKS. BUT AMONG THE UNVACCINATED AMONG POTENTIAL UNDOCUMENTED LATINOS NEARLY THREE AND FOUR WERE CONCERNED ABOUT MISSING WORK AT THE SIDE EFFECTS MAKE THEM FEEL SICK FOR A DAY OR MORE- IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAD TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT SHE- TAKING THE MAX MAX THE NATION O SHOWING UP TO WORK.
